Xinhua News Agency Report:

The United Nations General Assembly concluded its discussion on the question of Charter revision on November 21.

As previously reported, six countries, including the United States and Britain, had submitted a joint proposal on this issue. The proposal called for a general conference of United Nations member states to review the Charter and suggested the appointment of a committee of eighteen member states to decide on the time and place of the conference, as well as its organization and procedures. The purpose of this proposal was to revise the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter, particularly the principle of unanimity among the major powers.

This US proposal was opposed by representatives from many countries. The Syrian delegation even put forward an amendment requesting that the proposed committee only consider the suitability of revising the Charter, rather than preparing for a conference to review the Charter. The Syrian amendment also opposed the provision in the joint proposal to hold a conference to review the Charter at an "appropriate time." In addition, the Indian and Egyptian delegations also put forward an amendment advocating the expansion of the number of member states on the preparatory committee for the Charter review conference.

After the general debate, the General Assembly entered into substantive discussions on the joint proposal and its amendments on November 21, and voted on the joint proposal and its amendments. As a result, the Syrian amendment did not receive the required majority. The General Assembly adopted the amended joint proposal by a majority vote. The delegations of the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Syria voted against the proposal, while nine countries, including India, Afghanistan, Yugoslavia, and Norway, abstained.

After the vote, Soviet representative Zarubin spoke. He said that the Soviet delegation voted against the proposal because the Soviet Union believes that the United Nations Charter in its present form fully conforms to the tasks of consolidating universal peace and developing international cooperation in political, economic, social, cultural, and other fields. The Soviet delegation reiterated that the practice of revising the Charter would not strengthen trust between countries, would not be in the interests of further easing international tensions, and would not help the United Nations to carry out effective work. Zarubin concluded by saying that, for these reasons, the Soviet delegation believes it must declare that it will not participate in the committee established to prepare for the conference to review the Charter.

The press emphasized that the US delegation spent great efforts to secure the passage of the resolution on preparing for the convening of the conference. However, the fact that fourteen delegations voted in favor of Syria's proposal, which was opposed to the joint proposal of the United States, Britain, and other countries, and that nine delegations abstained, shows that the US attempt to revise the United Nations Charter has now met with fierce opposition from a large number of delegations. Only with the voting support of the Latin American countries' delegations and the delegations of the United States' partners in various military blocs was the United States barely able to pass the resolution on the establishment of a committee to prepare for the convening of a conference to revise the United Nations Charter. The press believes that this approach of the US delegation shows that the United States is trying hard to obstruct the easing of international tensions by deepening the divisions between United Nations member states.

### 联合国大会结束关于修改宪章问题的讨论　苏联代表指责美英修改宪章的企图

　　联合国大会结束关于修改宪章问题的讨论
  　苏联代表指责美英修改宪章的企图
    据新华社讯　联合国大会全体会议二十一日结束了关于修改宪章问题的讨论。
    前已报道，美英等六个国家曾经就这个问题提出了一项联合提案，提案要求召开联合国会员国全体会议来检查宪章，并且建议任命一个由十八个成员国组成的委员会来决定会议的时间和地点以及它的组织和程序。这个提案的目的是想修改联合国宪章的基本原则，特别是大国一致的原则。
    美国这个提案遭到了许多国家的代表的反对。叙利亚代表团并且提出了一项修正案，要求建议中的委员会只考虑修改宪章是否适宜的问题，而不是来筹备举行关于检查宪章的会议。叙利亚修正案还反对联合提案规定在“适当时期”举行检查宪章的会议这一点。此外，印度和埃及代表团也提出一项修正案，主张把检查宪章会议筹备委员会的成员国名额加以扩大。
    在一般性辩论结束后，大会在二十一日进入了关于联合提案及其修正案的实质讨论并就联合提案和它的修正案进行表决。结果叙利亚的修正案没有获得应有的多数票。大会以多数通过了经过修正的联合提案。投票反对这个提案的有苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰和叙利亚代表团，弃权的有印度、阿富汗、南斯拉夫、挪威等九个国家。
    在投票以后，苏联代表查鲁宾发言。他说，苏联代表团投票反对这个提案，因为苏联认为，现有形式的联合国宪章完全符合巩固普遍和平以及在政治、经济、社会、文化和其他方面发展国际合作的任务。苏联代表团再一次声明，修改宪章的做法不会加强国与国之间的信任，不符合进一步缓和国际紧张局势的利益，也不会有助于联合国进行有效的工作。查鲁宾最后说，根据这些理由，苏联代表团认为必须声明，它将不参加为筹备举行检查宪章会议而成立的委员会。
    新闻界人士着重指出，美国代表团花了很大的力量才争取到通过关于筹备召开会议的决议。但是，投票赞成同美、英等国的联合提案相对立的叙利亚的提案的有十四个代表团，而弃权的有九个代表团，这个事实说明，美国想修改联合国宪章的企图现在已经遭到了很大一部分代表团的激烈反对。只是靠着拉丁美洲国家的代表团和美国在各个军事集团中的合伙国家的代表团的投票支持，美国才得以勉强通过了关于成立筹备召开修改联合国宪章会议的委员会的决议。新闻界人士认为，美国代表团的这种做法表明，美国极力想通过加深联合国会员国之间的分歧来阻挠国际紧张局势的缓和。
