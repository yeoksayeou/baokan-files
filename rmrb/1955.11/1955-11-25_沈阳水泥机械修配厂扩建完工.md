　　Shenyang Cement Machinery Repair Plant Expansion Completed
　　The expansion of the Shenyang Cement Machinery Repair Plant was fully completed in early November. New equipment for processing large parts and various precision accessories is installed in the tall factory buildings. The five-meter gear milling machine in the machine shop can mill large gears with a diameter of five meters, and the huge vertical lathe can process large parts of more than five meters. The designed output of the newly installed Soviet-style automatic steelmaking furnace in the cast steel workshop is 51% higher than before the renovation.
　　This factory was renovated in 1954. Before the renovation, the factory's equipment was outdated and could not meet the needs of various cement plants for processing various accessories. Now, its total output value has increased by 58.35% compared with the highest output in 1954, and its cast iron output has increased about ten times. During the implementation of the Five-Year Plan, it will process and repair various parts for cement factories across the country.

　　沈阳水泥机械修配厂扩建完工
    沈阳水泥机械修配厂已于十一月初旬全部扩建完成。在高大的厂房中，安装着专门加工大部件和各种精密配件的新设备。机械车间的五公尺铣齿机能铣直径五公尺的大齿轮，庞大的立式车床能加工五公尺以上的大部件。铸钢车间新安装的苏式自动化炼钢炉设计产量比改建前提高百分之五十一。
    这个工厂是在一九五四年改建的。改建前，这座工厂设备破旧，远不能满足各水泥厂加工各种配件的需要，现在，它的生产总值已较一九五四年最高产量提高了百分之五十八点三五，铸铁产量提高十倍左右。它将在执行五年计划期间为全国各地水泥工厂加工和修配各种部件。
