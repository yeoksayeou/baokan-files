　　Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The United Nations General Assembly Political Committee concluded its discussion on the Korean question on the 22nd.

　　During the Political Committee meeting on the 22nd, the British and American representatives once again repeated their unfounded claims, insisting that the "uncompromising attitude adopted by the communists" hindered the resolution of the Korean question. However, their entire speech, their refusal to allow representatives from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to present their views, and their praise for the work of the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea, all demonstrate that they do not want to resolve the Korean question.

　　The Polish delegation proposed an amendment to the US delegation's proposal on the Korean question. The amendment suggested deleting the part of the US proposal that cited the one-sided report from the fifteen countries that participated in the war against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea regarding the Geneva conference on the Korean question. Polish representative Katz-Suchy said that this one-sided report could only prove that the attitude adopted by these countries was irreconcilable and at the same time indicated that the American and British delegations were trying to impose their conditions for resolving the Korean question on others, thereby hindering the resolution of the Korean question.

　　Subsequently, Soviet representative Malik spoke. He emphasized that the Soviet delegation believed that to achieve the peaceful unification of Korea, one should not rely on coercive means and forcibly impose one party's will on the other, but rather enable both North and South Korea to establish and develop cooperation and understanding to ensure that an agreement is reached on the final resolution of the Korean question. The Soviet delegation will vote in favor of the part of the proposal that reaffirms the continued validity of the Korean Armistice Agreement. This reaffirmation is extremely important, especially in light of the fact that the South Korean authorities, relying on foreign support, are opposing the armistice agreement, doing everything in their power to undermine it, and plotting to launch a new aggression against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The General Assembly certainly cannot ignore this action that endangers peace in the region.

　　However, the Soviet delegation must at the same time point out the serious shortcomings of this proposal. The Soviet delegation will vote against the report of the so-called United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea. The work and report of this commission only reflect the attitude and interests of one side of the Korean question. The Soviet delegation also supports the Polish delegation's amendment.

　　Malik said that the Soviet delegation cannot support the suggestion to include the Korean question on the agenda of the eleventh session of the General Assembly. In addition, this proposal continues to avoid mentioning an important issue, such as convening a conference of relevant countries with the participation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China to peacefully resolve the Korean question.

　　Next to speak was Indian representative Menon, who said that the Indian delegation could not support the American proposal. He said that the Indian delegation supports the Polish amendment because it eliminates this major shortcoming in the proposal.

　　A vote was then taken on the amendment and the proposal submitted by the American delegation.

　　Nine votes were in favor of the Polish amendment (Poland, the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Byelorussia, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, India, Afghanistan, Burma), and eight abstained. The amendment was not passed.

　　The entire proposal of the American delegation was passed with forty-five votes. When the entire proposal was voted on, eleven votes (Soviet Union, Ukraine, Byelorussia, Poland, Czechoslovakia, India, Indonesia, Burma, Syria, Chile, Bolivia) abstained.

### 联大政委会结束关于朝鲜问题的讨论  波、苏、印代表指责美英阻碍解决朝鲜问题

　　联大政委会结束关于朝鲜问题的讨论
　  波、苏、印代表指责美英阻碍解决朝鲜问题
    据新华社讯　联合国大会政治委员会二十二日结束了朝鲜问题的讨论。
    在政治委员会二十二日会议上，英国和美国代表再次发言重复他们毫无根据的说法，硬说“共产党所采取的不调和的态度”阻碍了朝鲜问题的解决。但是他们的全部发言，他们拒绝让朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表前来陈述意见以及他们称赞联合国朝鲜统一复兴委员会的工作这些事实都表明他们不想解决朝鲜问题。
    波兰代表团对美国代表团关于朝鲜问题的提案提出了修正案，修正案建议删去美国提案中引证参加对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国作战的十五国关于讨论朝鲜问题的日内瓦会议的片面报告的部分。波兰代表卡茨—苏希说，这个片面报告只能证明这些国家所采取的态度是不可调和的，同时表明，美国和英国代表团企图把自己解决朝鲜问题的条件强加给他人，从而阻碍朝鲜问题的解决。
    随后，由苏联代表马立克发言。他着重指出，苏联代表团认为，要求得朝鲜的和平统一，不能依靠强制手段和强把一方的意志加于另一方，而是应该使南北朝鲜双方建立和发展合作和谅解，以保证在朝鲜问题的最后解决方面取得协议。苏联代表团将投票赞成提案中重申朝鲜停战协定继续有效的一部分。这种重申是十分重要的，尤其是鉴于这里已经提到过的事实，即南朝鲜当局倚仗着外来的支持而反对停战协定，尽它一切力量去破坏这个协定，并且准备阴谋对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国发动新的侵略。大会当然不能忽视这种危害这一地区的和平的行动。
    但是，苏联代表团不得不同时指出这个提案的严重缺点。苏联代表团将投票反对所谓联合国朝鲜统一复兴委员会的报告。这个委员会的工作和报告只反映出朝鲜问题一方的态度和利益。苏联代表团并且支持波兰代表团的修正案。
    马立克说，苏联代表团不能支持关于把朝鲜问题列入大会第十一届会议议程的建议。此外，这个提案对像召开有朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国参加的有关国家和平解决朝鲜问题的会议这样一个重要问题仍然避而不谈。
    接着发言的是印度代表梅农，他说印度代表团不能支持美国提案。他说，印度代表团支持波兰的修正案，因为这个修正案消除了提案中的这一主要缺点。
    接着就修正案和美国代表团提出的提案进行表决。
    赞成波兰修正案的有九票（波兰、苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、捷克斯洛伐克、南斯拉夫、印度、阿富汗、缅甸），八票弃权。修正案没有被通过。
    美国代表团的整个提案以四十五票被通过。在整个提案表决时有十一票（苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸、叙利亚、智利、玻利维亚）弃权。
