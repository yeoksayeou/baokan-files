Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, November 14th: Burmese Prime Minister U Nu, before leaving Poland, answered some questions raised by a Polish radio reporter.

When asked about his impressions of this long journey, U Nu said, "I have visited India, Afghanistan, the Soviet Union, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, and Poland, seeing many things and meeting many people. What impressed me most was not anything else, but the very clear desire for peace that was expressed in every place I visited."

The reporter asked him for his views on the development prospects of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social and economic systems. U Nu replied, "I don't think the development prospects for peaceful coexistence are very bright at the moment, but I don't mean to say that the prospects are very dim either. You know very well how deep-rooted international fears and suspicions are, so we need some time to dispel and eliminate all these international fears and suspicions. But even if this is a difficult task, I believe that if we have the will to do this work, peaceful coexistence will eventually triumph." The reporter asked for his views on the current political situation in the Far East. U Nu said that he believed that the political situation in the Far East was not as dangerous as it had been a few months ago. He said, "I believe that the negotiations between the Chinese Ambassador and the American Ambassador in Geneva are producing some very useful results." He also said that in Indochina, the problems had not been completely resolved. "I hope that through international cooperation, things will be resolved quickly."
