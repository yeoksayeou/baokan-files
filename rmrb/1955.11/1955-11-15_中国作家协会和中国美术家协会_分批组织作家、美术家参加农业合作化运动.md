　　China Writers Association and China Artists Association
　　Organize Writers and Artists to Participate in the Agricultural Cooperation Movement in Batches
    (Our newspaper's report) To mobilize writers to better create a large number of literary and artistic works reflecting the high tide of the socialist mass movement in rural areas, the China Writers Association and its branches in various places, and the China Artists Association are widely organizing a large number of writers and artists to go to the countryside to participate in the agricultural cooperation movement, or to visit and tour the countryside for a relatively short period of time. The ways in which writers go to the countryside this time are divided into three types according to different situations: one is that writers who mainly describe rural areas will live in the countryside for a long time and participate in the rural socialist transformation movement; the other is that writers who cannot go to the countryside for a long time due to work reasons will participate in the agricultural cooperation movement for one or two months or three months; the third is a shorter period of time to visit and tour the countryside.
    The China Writers Association and the Shanghai, Shenyang, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Xi'an and other branches have determined that there are more than 60 writers going to the countryside. The writers who have already gone to the countryside or were originally in the countryside include: Zhou Libo, Zhao Shuli, Sha Ting, Liu Qing, Ma Jianling, Chen Xuechao, Xi Hong, Lu Zhuguo, etc.; those who will go to the countryside soon include: Xie Bingxin, Han Beiping, Yi Gong, Sun Yu, Cai Tianxin, Jiang Fan, Jian Xian'ai, Liu Zhixia, Yang Runsen, Bao Chang, Zhang Xuexin, Wang Anyou, Hai Mo, Miao Deyu, etc. The China Writers Association and its branches in various places are continuing to widely mobilize and organize writers and literary and art workers to go to the countryside. This winter and next spring, more people will go to rural areas across the country than this time.
    The China Artists Association plans to first organize artists Ye Qianyu, Ai Zhongxin, Wei Qimei, Li Zongjin, Li Keran, Liang Yulong and other ten people to visit agricultural production cooperatives in the suburbs of Beijing in batches and conduct creation.
    The China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the China Writers Association, in order to help writers and artists better study the Party Central Committee's decision on agricultural cooperation and to carry out creation reflecting agricultural cooperation, invited Comrade Hu Qiaomu on the 12th of this month to speak to literary and art workers in Beijing. In his speech, he gave the writers enthusiastic encouragement.

　　分批组织作家、美术家参加农业合作化运动
    本报讯　为了动员作家更好地创作大量反映农村社会主义群众运动高潮的文艺作品，中国作家协会及各地分会、中国美术家协会，正在广泛组织大批作家、美术家下乡，参加农业合作化运动，或比较短期的参观和访问农村。这次作家下乡的方式，根据不同的情况分为三种：一种是以描写农村为主要对象的作家，将长期地住在农村，参加农村社会主义改造运动；一种是因工作关系不能长期下乡的作家，将以一两个月或三个月的时间，参加农业合作化运动；一种是较短期的到农村参观和访问。
    中国作家协会和上海、沈阳、武汉、广州、重庆、西安等地分会，已确定下乡的作家有六十多人。现已到农村或原在农村的作家有：周立波、赵树理、沙汀、柳青、马健翎、陈学昭、西虹、陆柱国等；即将下乡的有：谢冰心、韩北屏、易巩、孙芋、蔡天心、江帆、蹇先艾、刘知侠、杨润身、鲍昌、张学新、王安友、海默、苗得雨等。中国作家协会和各地分会，广泛动员、组织作家和文艺工作者下乡的工作，还在继续进行，今冬明春，将有比此更多的人到全国各地农村去。
    中国美术家协会拟先组织美术家叶浅予、艾中信、韦启美、李宗津、李可染、梁玉龙等十人，分批到北京郊区访问农业生产合作社，并进行创作。
    中国文学艺术界联合会和中国作家协会为了帮助作家、艺术家更好地学习党中央关于农业合作化问题的决议，并且开展关于反映农业合作化的创作，曾于本月十二日邀请胡乔木同志向在北京的文艺工作者讲了话，他在讲话中给了作家热情的鼓励。
