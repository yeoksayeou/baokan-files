Molotov's Speech at the Final Meeting of the Four Foreign Ministers Conference on November 16

Gentlemen:
	Our meeting was decided upon by the heads of government of the four powers. This meeting has considered some of the issues stipulated in the instructions adopted at the July meeting. The purpose of our meeting is to study pressing international issues and to realize further easing of international tensions through joint efforts, thereby consolidating trust between countries.

	The main issue we must consider is the issue of European security, and the German issue in connection with it. This is understandable. Today, there is no more important issue than consolidating international peace and avoiding the danger of another war. This is especially true for Europe, because the past two world wars were launched in Europe. The heads of government of the four powers started from this premise. It can be seen from the text of their instructions, which link the above two issues, that the issue of European security is placed first.

	It is entirely natural for the issue of European security to take precedence for the people of Europe. The German issue is a subordinate issue connected to this. If European security is guaranteed, this will also ensure the safety of the German people and will provide the most favorable conditions for resolving the entire German issue—including the restoration of German unity.

	Throughout the conference, the Soviet delegation has strived to convince the representatives of the three countries—France, Britain, and the United States—that it is necessary to abide by the heads of government’s instructions regarding guaranteeing European security. For this purpose, we have proposed a draft of the basic principles of an all-European treaty for guaranteeing European collective security. We pointed out that establishing military blocs such as the North Atlantic Group and the Western European Union would not lead to good results. Such actions force other European countries to establish their own blocs as well. Only a collective security system that includes all European countries—regardless of their social or political systems—can meet the requirements of European peace and security.

	If some Western countries are not yet willing to establish a collective security system that includes all European countries, then, to begin with, a security treaty can be signed by a part of Europe, including the current two German states and the European countries that are now willing to join this organization. Regarding this, there are direct instructions in the heads of government’s instructions. We have also put forward some other suggestions with the same aim. But no agreement has been reached. The representatives of the United States of America, France, and Britain have demonstrated a desire that fundamentally does not conform to the decisions of the heads of government. They have attempted to make us not only agree to the re-militarization of West Germany, which is now being implemented in accordance with the Paris Accords, but also to agree to the re-militarization of East Germany and to the joining of the entire Germany into the military blocs of Western countries. They suggested that all this should be realized through corresponding all-German elections according to the so-called Eden Plan. Such a suggestion could not gain the support of all participants in the conference.

	The resolution of the German issue—the reunification of Germany—is inseparable from the question of what path a unified Germany should follow: should it become a militarist country and participate in the military blocs of some countries, or should it develop as a peaceful, democratic country that does not participate in any military blocs and cooperates with other countries to consolidate peace. Whoever avoids answering this question is hindering the resolution of the German issue.

	We note with regret that we have failed to seek a correct attitude towards the German issue at our conference. Although the representatives of the Western countries talked about the German issue in detail and with great pleasure, they did not agree to listen to the opinions of the representatives of the German people, and rejected our proposal to invite representatives from the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany to participate. This is simply unjustifiable. The deliberation of the German issue was conducted without the participation of the Germans, without the participation of representatives from West Germany and East Germany. From this fact alone, it can be said that this deliberation is doomed to failure.

	On the other hand, the proposals of the three Western powers are clearly contrary to the actual situation in Germany and the requirements for safeguarding peace and security in Europe.

	Today, it is impossible to resolve the German issue without considering the fact that there are two German states with different social systems. We must not fail to see the actual situation. It is quite clear that the attempt to have West Germany annex East Germany is impossible. However, the proposals of the three Western powers ultimately rely on the Eden Plan to have West Germany annex East Germany. This calculation is without foundation.

	We are in favor of restoring the unity of Germany on the basis of holding free all-German elections. But we cannot promote any plan that would re-militarize any part of Germany, especially the whole of Germany, or promote its integration into military blocs directed against the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries.

	We have been presented with a plan for reunifying Germany that ignores the fundamental task of reunifying Germany into a peaceful and democratic country. A draft has been presented to us stipulating that the reunification of Germany should be conditional upon the re-militarization of the whole of Germany, and not only maintaining the incorporation of West Germany, which is already incorporated into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, into this organization, but also incorporating East Germany, which the German Democratic Republic resolutely opposes.

	All this is said to be for the purpose of implementing the instructions of the heads of government, but this plan and draft on the German issue fundamentally violate the interests of European security and the interests of the German people; whereas the heads of government instructed that the resolution of the German issue and the reunification of Germany should be conducted in a manner "consistent with the national interests of the German people and the interests of European security."

	What is the result of the discussion on European security and the German issue?

	The discussion shows that the issue of European security is a very significant issue for the people of European countries, and without resolving this issue, the German issue cannot be resolved either. The discussion also shows that European security can be guaranteed even with the existence of two Germanys. However, for this to happen, it is necessary to abandon the plans for re-militarizing Germany—whether it is the Paris Accords or some sinister new scheme that includes both West Germany and East Germany.

	The discussion also showed that the resolution of the German issue should primarily be a matter for the Germans themselves, and without the participation of the Germans, discussions on the German issue cannot be fruitful at all.

	All this shows that the proposal of the German Democratic Republic contained in the statement issued by the government of the German Democratic Republic to our conference regarding the establishment of an all-German committee is urgent and completely correct. The establishment of an all-German committee composed of representatives from the parliaments of the two Germanys would not violate the interests of either of the existing Germanys, nor should it harm the existing social order of the German Democratic Republic or the Federal Republic of Germany.

	The representatives of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany must begin to jointly discuss all the issues that agitate the German people. Closer relations and cooperation must begin between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. Otherwise, it will be impossible to prepare for the restoration of German unity. We should not portray things as if the Americans, the French, the British, or the Soviets are more concerned about the resolution of the German issue than the Germans themselves. Only when the Germans themselves take on this task, and the Soviet Union, the United States, France, and Britain provide them with assistance, will progress be made in the resolution of the German issue. At that time, there will be conditions for a unified Germany, and a unified Germany will once again become a truly peaceful and democratic country.

	The discussion on European security and the German issue has not led us to a unanimously agreed conclusion. But we hope that this discussion will bring benefits, that the resolution of these issues will not be delayed any longer, and that we will be able to reach agreed conclusions and decisions.

	The conference paid close attention to the issue of disarmament. This issue is closely related to the vital interests of the people of all countries.

	Perhaps there is nothing that the people of the world desire more than to stop the arms race. It is also probably difficult to deny that the people of all countries are expecting countries such as the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, and France to take practical measures to prevent atomic war. To turn a deaf ear to the voices of the people would be to betray the trust of all peace-loving people in the world.

	The heads of government’s instructions on the issue of disarmament embody the desire to eliminate the threat of war and reduce the burden of armaments. To this end, the foreign ministers were entrusted with studying the work of the Disarmament Subcommittee, considering the opinions and suggestions put forward at the heads of government meeting, and studying whether it is possible to take further useful actions proactively in the area of disarmament. However, the results that have been achieved are not worth boasting about.

	This can be explained by simply looking at the suggestions put forward by the United States, Britain, and France on this issue. This suggestion does not mention stopping the arms race in any way. There is no mention at all of reducing armaments. This suggestion completely avoids the necessity of prohibiting atomic weapons, even though the United Nations had endorsed this proposal as early as 1946.

	Recently, the U.S. government, and later the British and French governments, began to change their past attitudes on the issue of reducing armaments and prohibiting atomic weapons. They refuse to discuss disarmament measures. In addition, the Western countries have adopted an attitude at the meeting that directly violates the instructions of the heads of government of the four powers. Disregarding these clear instructions, some people are attempting to prove here that it is impossible to realize a broad disarmament plan at present, and suggest only establishing supervision and inspection without taking any measures in the area of reducing armaments. It is impossible for such an approach to the issue of disarmament to produce positive results.

	The Soviet Union's position is clear and consistent. We believe that the main task in disarmament is to take practical steps to stop the arms race and to spare the people of all countries from the threat of atomic war. To achieve this, it is necessary to consistently implement a decision that the United Nations Organization unanimously adopted long ago, which stipulates that an international convention must be concluded, which provides for substantial reductions in all kinds of armaments and the prohibition of atomic weapons, and the establishment of international supervision.

	The suggestions put forward by the Soviet government on May 10th of this year embody all of this. It is no accident that these suggestions are gaining increasing sympathy in countries around the world.

	The Soviet Union's starting point is that, under the current circumstances, it is possible to achieve significant achievements in disarmament, including eliminating the threat of a sudden atomic attack. Under the current conditions, before the conclusion of a comprehensive convention stipulating the complete prohibition of atomic weapons, it is of great moral and political significance to morally and politically condemn the use of atomic and hydrogen weapons. If the United Nations Organization, at the initiative of the four countries attending this meeting, were to make such a moral and political condemnation, then people would have to take such a condemnation into account.

	We advocate that the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, and France declare that they will not be the first to use atomic and hydrogen weapons. The significance of this proposal for consolidating international trust and freeing the people of all countries from the terror of atomic attacks cannot be overestimated.

	We also suggest that our meeting unanimously express that the four countries will renounce the use of force in their relations with each other and strive to resolve any existing or potential differences between them only through peaceful means.

	Unfortunately, none of these suggestions have been accepted by the three Western countries. Therefore, we have no choice but to conclude the meeting without achieving practical results on this important issue.

	However, this situation will not affect our determination to persist in disarmament in the future. The Soviet Union will, as in the past, very resolutely and unwaveringly strive to stop the arms race and eliminate the threat of atomic war.

	It is necessary to talk about the third item on the agenda—the issue of developing contacts between East and West.

	The Soviet delegation has put forward suggestions aimed at eliminating obstacles hindering the development of free trade and economic relations between East and West. Economic relations are the real basis for the development of various other contacts between countries.

	The Soviet delegation has also put forward many suggestions on developing contacts in the areas of culture, science, journalism, broadcasting, art, sports, and travel. However, the Soviet delegation did not receive the support of the delegations of the United States, Britain, and France, whose suggestions deviated from the spirit of cooperation that was present when the heads of government of the four countries discussed the issue of contacts at the July Geneva conference.

	The Soviet delegation believes that there is a good basis for all the participating countries to reach an agreement on this issue in accordance with the instructions of the heads of government of the four countries and in compliance with the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries. It is precisely for this reason that the Soviet delegation has put forward its own suggestions.

	We believe that it is possible to bring the views of the four delegations closer together on the various issues I have pointed out above. Of course, this should be reflected in a unanimously agreed resolution, while continuing to work on other issues on which agreement has not been reached, many of which can be discussed in the process of bilateral negotiations between the relevant countries.

	However, the delegations of the three Western countries continue to insist on those suggestions that fall entirely within the scope of the authority of the relevant countries and belong to their internal affairs. Of course, such suggestions cannot be discussed at this meeting.

	We still believe that discussing the issue of contacts at this meeting will help formulate unanimously agreed decisions in the future. However, without waiting for these decisions, the Soviet government will take practical steps to develop contacts with countries that are willing to develop contacts. We hope to achieve good results in this area in line with the common goal of expanding international ties.

	We attach great importance to the achievements of the Geneva conference of the heads of government, because this conference reflects the universal desire of the people of all countries to ease international tensions. Since this conference, the Soviet Union has taken many new measures aimed at easing international tensions and strengthening trust between countries in accordance with the Geneva spirit. The Soviet Union will continue to advance along this path together with those who cherish peace and the interests of international cooperation, as it has done in the past.

	This foreign ministers' conference has ended without adopting any major decisions.

	It shows that every step forward in the cause of further easing international tensions will encounter considerable difficulties, requiring the overcoming of numerous obstacles and various sentiments that often do not advance this cause but rather push it backwards. Even today, we hear things that do not conform to the Geneva spirit. However, such actions can only lead to one's own isolation, and cannot improve one's position among the people of the world.

	At the same time, the conference has drawn the attention of the broad public to the most pressing issues of the present, which cannot but have a beneficial effect.

	Now, not only are various obstacles more visible, but also the broad possibilities for successfully resolving issues such as guaranteeing European security, disarmament, the German issue, and expanding economic and cultural ties between East and West are more visible. We are confident that this conference will contribute to the development of international cooperation and the further easing of international tensions.

### 十一月十六日在四国外长会议末次会议上　莫洛托夫的发言

　　十一月十六日在四国外长会议末次会议上
　　莫洛托夫的发言各位先生：
    我们的会议是四国政府首脑决定召开的，这次会议考虑了七月会议上通过的指示里所规定的一些问题。我们的会议的目的，是要研究迫切的国际问题，并且要通过共同的努力来实现国际紧张局势的进一步缓和，从而巩固国与国之间的信任。
    我们必须考虑的主要问题是欧洲安全问题，并且连带考虑德国问题。这样做是可以理解的。在今天，再没有比巩固国际和平和避免另一次战争的危险更加重要的问题了。这一点对欧洲来说特别正确，因为过去的两次世界大战都是在欧洲发动起来的。四国政府首脑就是从这个前提出发的。可以从他们的把上述两个问题联系起来的指示的文本中看出，欧洲安全问题被放在第一位。
    对欧洲人民来说，欧洲安全问题应当占首要地位，这是十分自然的。而德国问题是同这个问题有连带关系的一个从属性的问题。如果欧洲的安全得到了保障，这就也会保证德国人民得到安全，并且会为解决整个德国问题——包括恢复德国统一的问题——提供最有利的条件。
    在整个会议过程中，苏联代表团曾经努力使法、英、美三国的代表相信，遵守政府首脑关于保障欧洲安全问题的指示是必要的。为了这个目的，我们提出了关于保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约基本原则草案。我们指出，建立像北大西洋集团和西欧联盟这种军事集团是不会有好结果的。这样的行动迫使其他欧洲国家也建立他们自己的集团。只有一个包括全体欧洲国家——不管它们的社会制度或者政治制度如何——在内的集体安全体系才能满足欧洲和平和安全的要求。
    如果有些西方国家现在还不愿意建立一个包括欧洲全体国家的集体安全体系，那末，开始的时候可以由欧洲一部分国家，包括目前的两个德意志国家和现在已经愿意加入这个组织的欧洲国家，签订一个安全条约。关于这一点，政府首脑的指示中有直接的指示。我们还提出了抱着同一目的的另外一些建议。但是没有达成任何协议。美利坚合众国、法国和英国的代表表现了一种根本不符合政府首脑的决定的愿望。他们企图使我们不仅同意现在已经在按照巴黎协定实施的西德重新军国主义化，而且还同意东德重新军国主义化和使整个德国加入西方国家的军事集团。他们建议，这一切应当按照所谓艾登计划，通过相应的全德选举来实现。这样一个建议不能得到全体参加会议的人的支持。
    德国问题——重新统一德国——的解决，是同一个统一的德国应当沿着什么道路发展的问题分不开的：它应当变成一个军国主义国家而且参加某些国家的军事集团呢，还是应当作为一个不参加任何军事集团而且同其他国家合作来巩固和平的和平、民主国家发展下去。谁避不答复这个问题，谁就是阻碍德国问题的解决。
    我们遗憾地注意到：我们在我们的会议上未能求得对待德国问题的正确态度。虽然西方国家的代表们详细地、非常乐意地谈论德国问题，然而他们并不同意听取德国人民的代表们的意见，拒绝了我们提出的邀请德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国的代表参加的建议。这是无论如何也说不过去的。德国问题的审议，是在没有德国人参加，没有西德和东德的代表参加下进行的，单从这个事实来看，就已经可以说这种审议是注定要失败的。
    另一方面，西方三国的建议显然是同德国的实际情况和保障欧洲和平和安全的要求背道而驰的。
    在今天，不考虑有社会制度不同的两个德意志国家存在这个事实，而要解决德国问题，是不可能的。我们一定不要不看到实际情况。十分清楚，想使西德并吞东德的企图是不能实现的。然而，西方三国的建议归根结底是要依靠艾登计划而使西德并吞东德。这种盘算是毫无基础的。
    我们赞成在举行全德自由选举的基础上恢复德国的统一。但是我们不能促进那种使德国的任何部分，尤其是使整个德国重新军国主义化的计划，也不能促进把它并入针对苏联和爱好和平的其他国家的军事集团的计划。
    向我们提出的是一个无视了把德国重新统一成一个和平、民主的国家这个根本任务的重新统一德国的计划。向我们提出的一个草案规定德国的重新统一要有这样的条件：使整个德国重新军国主义化，并且不仅是把已经并入北大西洋公约组织的西德仍然并入这个组织，而且还要把东德也并进去，而这一点是德意志民主共和国坚决反对的。
    这一切据说都是为了执行政府首脑的指示，然而这种关于德国问题的计划和草案是根本违反欧洲安全的利益和德国人民的利益的；而政府首脑指示说，德国问题的解决和德国的重新统一应当在“符合德国人民的民族利益和欧洲安全的利益”的情况下进行。
    讨论欧洲安全和德国问题的结果怎样呢？
    讨论表明，欧洲安全问题是欧洲各国人民的一个十分重大的问题，这个问题不解决，德国问题也就不可能解决。讨论也还表明，即使在两个德国存在的情况下，欧洲安全也是可以得到保障的。但是，为此就必须抛弃德国重新军国主义化的计划——无论是巴黎协定，还是既包括西德也包括东德的某种居心叵测的新谋图，都必须抛弃。
    讨论还表明了德国问题的解决首先应当是德国人自己的事情，如果没有德国人参加，关于德国问题的讨论是根本不可能有成果的。
    这一切表明，德意志民主共和国政府向我们的会议发表的声明中所包含的德意志民主共和国关于建立全德委员会的建议，是迫切的，是完全正确的。成立由两个德国议会代表组成的全德委员会不会违反目前存在的任何一个德国的利益，而且也不应当会损害德意志民主共和国或是德意志联邦共和国现有的社会秩序。
    德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国的代表们必须开始共同讨论使德国人民激动的一切问题。德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国之间必须开始接近和合作。不然就不可能准备恢复德国的统一。我们不应当把事情说成这样：仿佛美国人、法国人、英国人或是苏联人比德国人自己更关心德国问题的解决。只有德国人自己承担起这件事情，而苏联、美国、法国和英国给他们帮助，那个时候，德国问题的解决才会取得进展。那个时候，就会有统一德国的条件，统一的德国就会重新成为一个真正和平和民主的国家。
    关于欧洲安全和德国问题的讨论还没有使我们取得一致同意的结论。但是我们希望：这种讨论会带来好处，这些问题的解决不会再拖延，我们能够作出大家同意的结论和决定。
    会议非常注意裁军问题。这个问题是关系到各国人民的切身利益的。
    也许，世界各国人民渴望的无过于停止军备竞赛了。恐怕也很难否认，各国人民是在期待美国、苏联、英国和法国这样一些国家采取防止原子战争的实际措施。充耳不闻人民的呼声，就辜负了全世界爱好和平的人们的信任。
    政府首脑关于裁军问题的指示体现了消除战争威胁和减轻军备负担的愿望。为此，外交部长们受到委托，要研究裁军小组委员会的工作，考虑政府首脑会议上提出的意见和建议，并且研究有没有可能在裁军方面主动采取进一步的有用的行动。但是，已经获得的结果是不值得夸说的。
    只要看一下美、英、法三国就这个问题提出的建议，就可以说明问题了。这个建议一个字也没有提到停止军备竞赛。根本没有谈到裁减军备。这个建议完全避而不谈禁止原子武器的必要性，尽管联合国早在一九四六年就赞成了这个主张。
    最近，美国政府，后来还有英国政府和法国政府，开始改变它们过去在裁减军备和禁止原子武器的问题上所采取的态度。他们拒绝讨论裁军措施。此外，西方国家在会上采取直接违反四国政府首脑指示的态度。有人在这里不顾这些明确的指示，企图在这里证明要在现在实现广泛的裁军计划是不可能的，并且建议只建立监督和视察，而不在裁减军备方面采取任何措施。这样对待裁军问题是不可能产生积极结果的。
    苏联的立场是明确的，始终如一的。我们认为：在裁军方面的主要任务是采取实际步骤，来停止军备竞赛，并且使各国人民免受原子战争威胁。要达到这一点，只有始终如一地执行联合国组织早就一致通过的一个决定，这个决定认为必须缔结一项国际公约，其中规定大量裁减各种军备和禁止原子武器，并且建立国际监督。
    苏联政府在今年五月十日提出的建议就体现了这一切。这些建议在世界各国得到越来越多的同情，这并不是偶然的。
    苏联的出发点是：在目前情况下，有可能在裁军方面，其中包括消除原子武器的突然袭击的威胁方面，获得重大的成就。在目前条件下，在缔结规定完全禁止原子武器的全面公约之前，在道义上和政治上谴责使用原子武器和氢武器具有重大意义。如果联合国组织根据出席这次会议的四国的倡议，作出这种道义上和政治上的谴责，那末，人们就不能不考虑这种谴责。
    我们主张美国、苏联、英国和法国宣布自己首先不使用原子武器和氢武器，这个建议是符合这种目的的。这种行动对于巩固国际信任，对于使各国人民摆脱原子袭击的恐怖，它的意义是无论怎样估计也不会过高的。
    我们还建议我们的会议一致表示：四国在它们相互间的关系中将放弃使用武力，并且努力只通过和平途径来解决它们之间存在的或是可能发生的分歧。
    遗憾的是这些建议没有一个被西方三国接受，因此，我们只好在没有就这个重要的问题获得实际结果的情况下结束会议。
    但是，这种情况并不能影响我们今后坚持裁军的决心。苏联仍然要同过去一样，十分坚决和始终不渝地争取停止军备竞赛和消除原子战争的威胁。
    有必要谈一下第三项议程——发展东西方之间的接触问题。
    苏联代表团已经提出旨在消除妨碍东西方之间发展自由贸易和经济关系的建议，经济关系是各国之间发展其他各种接触的现实基础。
    苏联代表团还就发展在文化、科学、新闻、广播、艺术、体育和旅行等方面的接触提出许多建议。但是，苏联代表团没有得到美国、英国和法国代表团的支持，它们的建议离开了七月日内瓦四国政府首脑会议讨论关于接触问题时所具有的合作精神。
    苏联代表团认为，如果所有的会议参加国本着四国政府首脑的指示和遵守互不干涉其他国家内政的原则，就这个问题达成协议是具有良好基础的。正因为如此，苏联代表团提出了自己的建议。
    我们认为，在我以上指出的各个问题上，四国代表团之间的观点是有可能接近的。当然，这一点应当在一致同意的决议中反映出来，同时对其他没有取得一致意见的问题继续进行工作，其中许多问题是可以在各有关国家之间的双边谈判的过程中加以讨论的。
    但是，三个西方国家的代表团继续坚持完全属于各有关国家权限范围之内的、属于它们内政问题的那些建议，当然，这类建议是不能够在这个会议上加以讨论的。
    我们仍然认为，在这个会议上讨论接触问题将有助于今后制订一致同意的决定。不过，苏联政府不等待这些决定，就将采取实际步骤同愿意发展接触的国家发展接触。我们希望本着扩大国际联系的共同目的在这一方面取得良好的结果。
    我们十分重视政府首脑日内瓦会议的成就，因为这个会议反映了各国人民争取缓和国际紧张局势的普遍愿望。在这个会议以后，苏联已经采取了旨在按照日内瓦精神缓和国际紧张局势和加强国与国之间的信任的许多新的措施。苏联今后仍将同那些珍视和平和国际合作的利益的人们一起沿着这条道路前进。
    这次外交部长会议在没有通过任何重大的决定的情况下结束。
    它表明，在进一步缓和国际紧张局势的事业中每向前迈进一步都会遭到不小的困难，都需要克服重重障碍以及常常不是把这一事业向前推进而是向后倒退的种种情绪。甚至在今天我们也听到不符合日内瓦精神的某些东西。但是，这样的行动只能使自己陷入濒于孤立的地位，而不能改进自己在世界各国人民中间的地位。
    同时，会议引起了广大公众对当前最迫切问题的注意，这不会不产生良好的影响。
    现在不仅更加显示出了各种障碍，而且也更加显示出了顺利解决保证欧洲安全、裁军、德国问题、扩大东西方之间的经济和文化联系等这样一些问题的广泛可能性。我们确信，这次会议将有助于发展国际合作和进一步缓和国际紧张局势。
