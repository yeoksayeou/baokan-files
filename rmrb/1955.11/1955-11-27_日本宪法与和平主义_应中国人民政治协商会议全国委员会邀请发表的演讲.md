　　The Japanese Constitution and Pacifism
　　--Speech at the Invitation of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
　  Pian Shan Zhe, Head of the Visiting Delegation of the "National Federation for the Protection of the Constitution of Japan"
　　Just now, the most esteemed Mr. Guo Moruo solemnly delivered a welcoming speech to us, for which we express our deepest gratitude.

　　I am deeply grateful to everyone for giving me the opportunity to speak today before such a knowledgeable and insightful audience of authorities in your country.

　　If I were to talk about all the things we have been grateful for and deeply moved by since coming to your country, there would be too many to count, and it would take a long time. Therefore, I will not talk about these things today, but I would like to quickly address the issue of "The Japanese Constitution and Pacifism," which I must ask you all to listen to.

　　Firstly, because I believe that upholding the Japanese Constitution will safeguard Japan's peace and independence.

　　Secondly, I believe that our ability to protect this constitution and prevent rearmament will greatly contribute to promoting the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Japan and the friendly relations between the two peoples.

　　Therefore, I would like to introduce to you the principles of the Japanese Constitution, especially pacifism, which is a characteristic of this constitution. Briefly speaking, judging from Japan's national character and the circumstances surrounding the drafting of the constitution, although the Japanese Constitution cannot yet be called a socialist constitution, it has not reached that point; it thoroughly implements democracy, thereby thoroughly implementing the spirit of popular sovereignty and the protection of human rights in constitutional laws and regulations.

　　The Japanese Constitution has three characteristics.

　　The first characteristic is the thoroughness of popular sovereignty and democracy.

　　The constitution stipulates the abolition of the political power that the Emperor has always possessed, the expulsion of warlords and the dissolution of zaibatsu, and the abolition and deprivation of bureaucratic privileges. The constitution takes such a form that, from the perspective of Japan's national character and national sentiment, the Emperor exists as a symbol, although there is so-called rule, but does not engage in politics, please understand this. In Japan, the parliament is called the Diet, and the Diet is the highest political organ. This is manifested in the fact that the Japanese people exercise political rights for the welfare of the people in the Diet through legally elected representatives.

　　The second characteristic is the issue of guaranteeing basic human rights.

　　Regarding this issue, the constitution has formulated as many as thirty-one articles, and human rights that were completely ignored in the past are respected, and the right to life is guaranteed. The rights to personality and survival that we have struggled for for a long time without success have been guaranteed by this constitution. The constitution recognizes the position of workers, recognizes the right to unite and the unity of trade unions, and guarantees the right from collective bargaining to strikes, and further guarantees equal rights for men and women.

　　This constitution stipulates that men and women are not subject to any discrimination in politics and are equal in society and economy; it recognizes the status of women (who have suffered heavy oppression under the extremely feudal family system in the past); it abolishes the feudal family system; and it resolutely implements marriage system reforms in marriage and divorce. Moreover, this constitution helped abolish the Ministry of Justice, which was a source of evil that trampled on human rights and extremely oppressed the people in the past; it reformed the litigation system and the prosecutor's indictment system; and it reformed the agricultural land system, handing over land to tenant farmers.

　　As mentioned above, from a political, social, and economic point of view, it should be further advanced; however, this constitution has generally established some systems.

　　Next, I want to talk about pacifism.

　　The Japanese Constitution can be said to be a constitution that truly implements the spirit of peace.

　　I would like to say here, in front of everyone, that I believe that the Japanese Constitution can boast to the whole world in this regard. The article in the Japanese Constitution that implements the spirit of peace is Article 9. Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution stipulates as follows:

　　Aspiring sincerely to an international peace based on justice and order, the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes. In order to accomplish the aim of the preceding paragraph, land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be maintained. The right of belligerency of the state will not be recognized.

　　What we, the National Federation for the Protection of the Constitution of Japan, want to uphold, what we want to emphasize and firmly advocate is this article on renouncing war, is the implementation of pacifism. That is to say, abolishing the old military diplomacy backed by force and replacing it with the implementation of peace diplomacy based on justice and order, based on the basic spirit and foundation of justice and order, and not using any force to resolve international disputes. I would like to mention that the joint communique a few days ago was precisely on this point that an agreement was reached and published.

　　The provision of Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution on renouncing war has had a great impact internationally and within Japan, and has played a huge role in overthrowing the past feudal and dictatorial autocratic politics and moving towards democracy in politics, and has received the effect of liberating the masses of the people from heavy oppression, because the people are suffering from very heavy financial and economic oppression due to the implementation of rearmament. The effect of Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution is also manifested in liberating the masses of the people from the heavy tax oppression of implementing rearmament, which will create conditions for gradually building peaceful cultural facilities.

　　Not long ago, we were invited and guided by you and had the opportunity to visit the Labor Cultural Palace in Tianjin. I was very happy, and I felt that the Labor Cultural Palace that I had imagined in my dreams has become a reality here.

　　However, although this constitution has achieved results as mentioned above, today, conservative reactionary forces are attempting to revise and maliciously revise this important peace constitution. This is what I want to tell everyone now. They are trying to:

　　First, maliciously revise Article 9 of the constitution and implement rearmament;

　　Second, restore the Emperor system with the Emperor as the head of state;

　　Third, turn back the clock and restore the feudal old-style family system;

　　Fourth, maliciously revise the three labor laws that have helped the cause of workers' liberation.

　　Of course, we are resolutely fighting against this attempt to maliciously revise the constitution.

　　Our National Federation for the Protection of the Constitution of Japan believes that our most important task and greatest mission is to publicize the spirit of peace embodied in this constitution to the masses of the people at home and inside and outside the Diet, and we are working hard for this.

　　This time, we issued a joint communique, which said that China and Japan should not be countries at war, but should be countries that move forward together to strive for peace in Asia. I think the communique has given the Japanese people great hope. I am very happy that we have reached a stage where we will soon reach an agreement on mutual cultural exchange.

　　We are willing to exchange fragrant and elegant cultures and arts with each other, and blow a warm and peaceful spring breeze, instead of the honest John-style atomic cannons sent from across the distant ocean. This is our heartfelt wish.

　　Due to this visit to your country, we have discovered many similarities and very similarities between the people of China and Japan. We have also discovered that the two countries have the same proverbs. We have seen before our eyes, here, the history of long-term exchanges in not only culture but also life between China and Japan, and I feel very happy.

　　We, who have consistently dedicated ourselves to the cause of peace, will never forget the warm hospitality we received from your country during this visit, and we express our deep gratitude.

　　For the sake of lasting peace, I wish China and Japan friendship and goodwill, and that the two countries shake hands tightly, tightly to eternity. With this, I conclude my speech. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　日本宪法与和平主义
　　——应中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会邀请发表的演讲
　  日本“拥护宪法国民联合会”访华团团长　片山哲
    方才，我所最尊敬的郭沫若先生郑重地向我们致欢迎词，我们表示非常感谢。
    我深深地感谢大家，今天使我有机会在贵国的知识和见解都很高超的权威面前讲话。
    如果要我来谈一谈来到贵国以后值得我们感谢的和受到非常深刻的感动的事情，那是多得不可胜数的，需要很长的时间。因此，今天不谈这些，我想赶快地谈一谈“日本宪法与和平主义”这个问题，这一定要请各位听一听。
    因为首先，我相信拥护日本宪法，就能保卫住日本的和平和独立。
    其次，我认为，我们能够保卫住这个宪法，阻止住重整军备，这将非常有助于促进中日两国邦交的恢复和两国国民的友好亲善。
    因此，我想向大家介绍一下日本宪法的原则，特别是作为这部宪法的特点的和平主义。简略地说，从日本的国体和制定宪法当时的经过情形看来，日本的宪法虽然还不能说是社会主义宪法，还没有达到这个地步；但是它贯彻着民主主义，从而在宪法法规上彻底地贯彻着主权在民和保障人权的精神。
    日本宪法有三个特点。
    第一个特点是主权在民和民主的彻底性。
    宪法规定废除天皇一向拥有的政治大权，驱逐军阀并解散财阀，取消和剥夺官僚特权。宪法采取了这样一种形式，从日本的国体和国民感情上来说，天皇是作为一个象征而存在，虽然有所谓君临，可是不搞政治，请各位了解这一点。在日本把议会叫做国会，国会是最高政治机关。这表现在日本国民通过依法选出的代表在国会上为了国民的福利而行使政治权利上面。
    第二个特点是保障基本人权问题。
    关于这个问题，宪法制定了长达三十一条的条款，过去完全被人漠视的人权得到尊重，生活的权利得到保障。过去我们进行长期斗争而未能获得的这个人格权和生存权，由于这个宪法而得到了保障。宪法承认了工人的立场、承认了团结的权利和工会的团结，保障了从集体谈判到罢工的权利，进而保障了男女平权。
    这部宪法规定，男女在政治上不受任何歧视，在社会上在经济上一律平等；承认妇女的地位（妇女过去曾经在非常封建的家族制度下遭受沉重的压迫）；废除封建的家族制度；坚决实行结婚和离婚的婚姻制度改革。并且，这部宪法帮助废除了司法省，司法省过去是蹂躏人权、极端压迫国民的罪恶渊薮；改革了诉讼制度和检察官起诉制度；改革了农地制度，把土地交给了佃农。
    如上所述，从政治上以及从社会、经济方面来说，还应当前进一步；但是，这部宪法大体上是建立了一些体制。
    下面我要谈一谈和平主义。
    日本宪法可以说是一部真正贯彻了和平精神的宪法。
    我想在这里，在大家面前说，我相信日本宪法在这一点是可以向全世界夸耀的。日本宪法贯彻和平精神的条款是第九条。日本宪法第九条这样规定：
    日本国民诚实希望以正义与秩序为基础之国际和平。所谓国权发动之战争与武力之威吓及行使，永久予以放弃，不作为解决国际纷争之手段。为达到这项目的计，不保持陆海空及其他战力，不承认国家之交战权。
    我们拥护宪法国民联合会所要拥护的、我们要强调和坚决主张的是这个放弃战争的条款，是贯彻和平主义的这一点。就是说，废除以武力为后盾的那种旧的武力外交，代之以实行以正义和秩序为背景的、以正义和秩序为基本精神和基础的和平外交，不使用任何武力来解决国际纷争。我要提一下，前几天的联合公报正是在这一点上取得一致意见而发表了的。
    日本宪法第九条的放弃战争的规定，在国际上和在日本国内都发生了很大的影响，起了打倒过去的封建和独裁专制政治、在政治上走向民主的巨大作用，并且收到从沉重的压迫下解放国民群众的效果，因为国民由于实行重整军备而承受着非常沉重的财政和经济压迫。日本宪法第九条的效果还表现在从实行重整军备的重税压迫下解放国民群众上面，这将创造条件，有可能逐步兴建和平的文化设施。
    不久以前，我们受到你们的邀请和向导，有机会在天津参观了劳动文化宫。我非常高兴，我觉得我平日在梦中所想像的劳动文化宫在这里成为事实。
    但是，如上所述这部宪法虽然收到效果，可是今天，保守反动势力正在企图修改、恶劣地修改这个重要的和平宪法。这就是现在我要告诉大家的。他们企图：
    第一、恶劣地修改宪法第九条，实行重整军备；
    第二、恢复以天皇为元首的天皇元首制；
    第三、向回开倒车，恢复封建的旧式家族制度；
    第四、恶劣地修改曾经有助于工人解放事业的三个劳工法律。
    当然，我们对于这种恶劣地修改宪法的企图，正在坚决地展开斗争。
    我们日本拥护宪法国民联合会认为，我们最重要的工作和最伟大的使命，就是在国内和国会内外，向国民群众宣传这部宪法具有的贯彻和平的精神，我们正为此而努力。
    这次，我们发表了一项联合公报，公报说中国和日本不应当是打仗的国家，而应当是为争取亚洲和平而一道前进的国家，我认为公报给了日本国民很大的希望。我感到很高兴，我们已经到达这样一个阶段：最近就要达成一项互相交流文化的协议。
    我们愿意互相交流清香而高雅的文化和艺术，刮起温暖而和平的春风，以代替从遥远的大洋彼岸送来的诚实的约翰式原子炮，这是我们由衷的愿望。
    由于这次访问贵国，我们发现了中日两国国民许多相似和非常相似的地方。我们还发现了两国有同样的谚语。我们在眼前、在这里看到了中日两国的不仅是文化，还有生活上的长期交流的历史，我感到非常快乐。
      一贯献身于和平事业的我们，这次访问贵国，受到贵国的殷勤招待将终生不忘，深深表示感谢。
    为了持久的和平，祝中国和日本亲善友好，两国紧紧地握手，紧紧地握到永久，以此结束我的演讲。（新华社）
