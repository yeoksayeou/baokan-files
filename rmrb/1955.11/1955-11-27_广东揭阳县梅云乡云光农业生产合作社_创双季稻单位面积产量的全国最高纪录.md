　　Guangdong Jieyang County Meiyun Township Yun Guang Agricultural Production Cooperative
  　Creates National Record for Highest Unit Area Yield of Double-Crop Rice
    The Yun Guang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Meiyun Township, Jieyang County, Guangdong Province, led by Lin Yancheng, a national model for rice production, has set a new national record for the highest unit area yield of double-crop rice this year.

    The average yield of the more than sixty mu of late rice fields already harvested by the Yun Guang Agricultural Production Cooperative reached 891 jin per mu. Among them, two mu of high-yield fields yielded 1,158 jin per mu, and with the early rice yield, the total annual yield per mu reached 2,020 jin. This figure is 24.5 percent higher than the 1,622 jin yield that earned Lin Yancheng the National Rice Production Model award in 1951, making it the national record for the highest unit area yield of double-crop rice. The more than thirty mu of rice currently being harvested are mostly first-class fields, and the estimated yield will be even higher than that already harvested.

    In the past, farmers in Meiyun Township were accustomed to planting rice with large sparse seedlings, making it difficult to increase the unit area yield. After the establishment of the Yun Guang Agricultural Production Cooperative, under the leadership of Lin Yancheng, the members changed from large sparse seedlings to small dense seedlings, and universally selected the local high-quality variety "Shi Shi Qian," resulting in an increase of 182 jin per mu compared to last year. Due to the extensive use of natural fertilizers, the cost of rice per mu was also reduced by 40 percent compared to last year.

    Although the early rice crop of this cooperative suffered a severe drought and yields were reduced, due to the bumper harvest of late rice, the income of the members will generally increase by 15 to 25 percent or more. The entire cooperative has now decided to sell 30,000 jin of surplus grain to the state. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　广东揭阳县梅云乡云光农业生产合作社
  　创双季稻单位面积产量的全国最高纪录
    全国水稻丰产模范林炎城领导的广东省揭阳县梅云乡云光农业生产合作社，今年创造了双季稻单位面积产量的全国最高纪录。
    云光农业生产合作社已经收割的六十多亩晚稻田的产量平均每亩达到八百九十一斤。其中两亩丰产田每亩收一千一百五十八斤，加上早稻的产量，每亩全年产量达到二千零二十斤。这个数字比林炎城本人获得一九五一年全国水稻丰产模范奖励的产量一千六百二十二斤要高出百分之二十四点五强，成为双季稻单位面积产量的全国最高纪录。目前正在收割的三十多亩水稻大多是一级田，估计产量将比已经收割的更高。
    梅云乡农民种的水稻过去都习惯于大株疏植，单位面积产量很难提高。云光农业生产合作社成立以后，社员们在林炎城的带动下改大株疏植为小株密植，并且普遍选用当地良种“十石歉”，结果每亩比去年增产一百八十二斤。由于大量采用自然肥料，每亩水稻的成本也比去年降低百分之四十。
    这个社的早稻虽然遭受严重的旱灾而减产，但是由于晚稻丰收，社员的收入还能普遍增加百分之十五到二十五以上。现在全社决定出售余粮三万斤给国家。　（新华社）
