Lowering Labor Conditions is Not Saving

Some textile factories do not care about the labor conditions and lives of their employees, and one-sidedly practice thrift.

The electric lights in the production workshops of the state-owned Shanghai No. 19 Cotton Textile Factory are installed very high, the number of lights is low, and the voltage does not meet the requirements, so the light is very dim, which can easily damage the workers' eyesight. The factory could solve this problem with a small amount of money. However, the workshop director of the factory's power department said, "Increasing the voltage is possible, but if the voltage is not increased, the lifespan of the light bulbs can be extended." In order to save medical expenses, Jinan Chengtong Yarn Factory stipulates that workers must have a fever of 40 degrees Celsius before they can be given penicillin injections, and minor illnesses and sores are not treated with medicine. In Ningbo, some factories restrict the lights in workers' dormitories to only be turned on for forty minutes per night.

It turns out that the staff of these factories have a strange idea. They say: "Although living conditions are important, let's talk about them after the thrift campaign is over." They mistakenly put practicing thrift in opposition to caring about the labor conditions and lives of employees.

　  降低劳动条件不是节约
    有些纺织工厂不关心职工群众的劳动条件和生活，片面地厉行节约。
    国营上海第十九棉纺织厂生产车间的电灯装得很高，灯光支数又低，再加上电压又不合规定，灯光十分暗淡，所以很容易损害工人的视力。工厂只要花不多的钱，这个问题就可以解决。但是工厂原动部车间主任说：“提高些电压是可以的，但是不提高电压，灯泡的寿命就能够延长。”济南成通纱厂为了节约医药费，规定工人一定要发烧到四十度才给打盘尼西林针，小病小疮不给用药。宁波市有的工厂，限制工人宿舍里的电灯每晚只准开四十分钟。
    原来这些工厂的工作人员有一种奇怪的想法。他们说：“生活问题虽然重要，但是等节约运动过后再说吧”，他们错误地把厉行节约和关心职工的劳动条件和生活对立起来。
