In some newly established agricultural production cooperatives in Jiangsu Province, some accountants have low levels of literacy and numeracy, and often record work points incorrectly, which affects the production enthusiasm of the members and the unity within the cooperative. In Qin Nan District of Yancheng County, some illiterate cooperative members, fearing that the accountants would misrecord their points, would mark lines on their doors or tie "knots" in grass ropes to keep count. This example shows that the members urgently need to learn to read and write and to carry out necessary supervision of the cooperative's financial work.

The Liangzhuang Peasant Spare-time School in Maba District, Xuyi County, came up with a simple method to help the members of the Liangzhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative quickly learn to record work points. This method is to teach the cooperative members the numbers "one" to "ten" and the four characters "day," "month," "work," and "point." The cooperative members can use these fourteen characters to record their work points. This educational method, closely combined with reality, also improved the peasants' interest in learning to read and write.

　  让社员都学会记工分账
    在江苏省某些新建立的农业生产合作社里，有些会计文化水平不高，常常记错了工分账，影响了社员的生产积极性和社内的团结。盐城县秦南区有些不识字的社员怕会计记错账，就在门板上划杠子，或用草绳打“疙瘩”记数。从这一事例中可以说明，社员们是迫切需要学习文化，对社的财务工作进行必要的监督的。
    盱眙县马坝区板桥乡梁庄农民业余学校想了一个简便办法，帮助梁庄农业生产合作社社员很快就学会了记工分账。这个办法是教会社员“一”到“十”的数字和“日”、“月”、“工”、“分”四个字，社员们运用这十四个字就会记工分账了。这种密切结合实际的教育方法，也提高了农民们学习文化的兴趣。
