The state-owned Shanghai No. 14 Cotton Textile Factory, since March of this year, has discovered many "wonderful tricks" in order to "save yarn." The first is to "shorten the sizing length," reducing the original length of each piece of cloth from 44 yards and 9 inches to 43 yards and 29 inches. The warp yarn sizing was shortened, but the length of the cloth did not meet the prescribed standards. What to do? The second "trick" came: increase the pressure of the loom to forcibly stretch the cloth, stretching 80 and a half yards of cloth to 82 yards. The cloth was stretched longer, but the width of the cloth became narrower. What to do? So they found a third "trick": the state originally stipulated that the standard cloth width was 36 inches and 2 points, allowing for an upward and downward deviation of 0.393 inches, so they took advantage of this loophole, making the width of the cloth go straight to the narrow side, not to the wide side.

However, these "tricks" of theirs are not considered wonderful by anyone except themselves. As soon as they promoted these "trick cloths," sales departments in Guangdong, Anhui, Suzhou, Wuxi, Kunshan, and Shanghai all refused them and returned them one after another.

Under the instruction of the higher-level Party committee, the leaders of the Shanghai No. 14 Cotton Mill conducted an inspection of the matter and also made a public self-criticism. What about other places? It is hoped that they will also conduct inspections. We must be serious about saving, and we must never joke around with state property.

### 奇妙的“窍门”

    奇妙的“窍门”
    国营上海第十四棉纺织厂自今年三月以来，为了“节约用纱”，找出了很多“奇妙的窍门”。第一个是“缩短浆码”，把原来每匹四十四码九吋长的布缩短到四十三码二十九吋。经纱浆码是缩短了，但是布的长度不合乎规定的标准。怎么办呢？第二个“窍门”又来了：增加布机车的压力，硬把布拉长，把八十码半的布拉到八十二码。布拉长了，布幅却变狭了。怎么办呢？于是找出了第三个“窍门”：国家原来规定布幅标准阔度为三十六吋二分，允许有零点三九三吋的上下偏差，于是他们就钻了这个空子，使布幅的阔度直往狭处走，不往宽处行。
    可是他们这些“窍门”，除了他们自己以外，别人都不认为美妙。当他们刚把这些“窍门布”推销出去，广东、安徽、苏州、无锡、昆山以及上海市等地销售部门处处不要，纷纷退回。
    在上级党委指示下，上海国棉十四厂领导人员对此事作了检查，还进行了公开的检讨。别的地方呢？希望也都检查一下。要正正经经地节约，决不能拿国家的财产开玩笑。
