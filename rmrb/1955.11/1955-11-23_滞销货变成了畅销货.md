　　Stagnant Goods Become Bestsellers

　　The Living Materials Wholesale Station of the Xuyi County Supply and Marketing Cooperative Supply Management Department in Jiangsu Province purchased 540 chi of oilcloth from Qingjiang City in June this year, but only 113 chi had been sold in more than four months. The staff of the Wholesale Station believed that this kind of cloth was unsalable material that did not meet the needs of the masses. After the peak season arrived, the staff of this wholesale station studied the needs of consumers and processed the stockpiled oilcloth into 534 diaper pads. Because the price of these diaper pads was both cheap and met the needs of the masses, the wholesale station sold 444 pads in ten days.

　　As long as commercial staff truly use their brains and study the needs of consumers, some unsalable materials can be transformed into bestsellers through processing and modification.

　  滞销货变成了畅销货
    江苏省盱眙县供销合作社供应经理部生活资料批发站，在今年六月份从清江市购进油布五百四十尺，但是四个多月来只销出一百十三尺。批发站的工作人员认为这种布匹是不适合群众需要的滞销物资。市场旺季到来以后，这个批发站的工作人员研究了消费者的需要，把积压的油布加工成五百三十四条尿垫布。因为这种尿垫布的价格既便宜，又适合群众需要，结果批发站在十天当中就销出四百四十四条。
    商业工作人员只要真正开动脑筋，研究消费者的需要，有些滞销物资经过加工改制，也是可以变为畅销物资的。
