　　Eliminating Abnormal Phenomena
　　In the First Agricultural Cooperative Group of Taling Township, Longshui District, Xinhui County, Guangdong Province, two new agricultural production cooperatives were established, and at the same time, 56 new individual farming households were added. How did this abnormal phenomenon arise? Because when these two cooperatives were established, the original nine mutual aid teams were broken up. The team members who did not join the cooperatives were not organized by anyone. As a result, the number of individual farming households increased from 20 to 76. After the Taling Township Party Branch discovered this phenomenon, it immediately used this fact to educate party members and decided to draw a deputy director from each cooperative to organize individual farming households, consolidate the original mutual aid teams, and establish new mutual aid teams to seize the autumn harvest and winter planting. As a result, after four days of publicity and outreach work throughout the township, 50 new mutual aid teams were formed, with more than 330 farming households joining the teams.
　　The Taling Township Branch did the right thing. Our establishment of agricultural production cooperatives is to promote the agricultural collectivization movement. If after the establishment of cooperatives, the original mutual aid teams are broken up, and the mutual aid team members are not organized to continue cooperative mutual aid production, but instead, many mutual aid team members are allowed to regress to individual farming, how can this be said to be promoting the collectivization movement?

　  消除反常现象
    广东省新会县泷水区塔岭乡的第一农协小组，新成立了两个农业生产合作社，同时又新增加了五十六户单干户。这种反常现象是怎样产生的呢？因为这两个社成立的时候，把原来九个互助组打散了，没有入社的组员，没有人去组织他们，结果单干户就从二十户增加到七十六户。塔岭乡的党支部发现这种现象以后，立即用这一事实来教育党员，并且决定从每一个社内抽出一个副主任来组织单干户，巩固原有互助组和成立新的互助组，抓紧秋收冬种。结果，全乡经过四天宣传串连工作，新组成了五十个互助组，入组农民有三百三十多户。
    塔岭乡支部这件事做得很对。我们成立农业生产合作社，是为了推进农业合作化运动，如果成立了合作社，把原有互助组打散以后，不去组织互助组员继续合作互助进行生产，反而让很多互助组员倒退为单干户，这怎么能说是推进了合作化运动呢？
