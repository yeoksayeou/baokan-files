A Beautiful and Moving Opera Performance
　　On the Performance of "Kongju and Patju" by the Korean Youth Art Troupe
　　Lu Su, Director of the Chinese Musicians Association

　　From a long time ago, the story of "Kongju and Patju" has been circulating among the Korean people. This beautiful story embodies the clear love and hate of the Korean people, and their desire to resist oppression and live a better life. The outline of the story is as follows: In a mountain village, there is a girl named Kongju. This girl lost her biological mother. Kongju is kind, hardworking, and beautiful, but she suffers abuse from her stepmother and her stepmother's daughter, Patju. The stepmother and Patju take the iron hoe from Kongju's hand and tell her to use a wooden hoe to hoe a stony field, while Patju uses the iron hoe to hoe a sandy field. The royal palace holds a banquet for the prince's birthday, and many people go to attend. Kongju's stepmother and Patju also go to attend. Kongju also wants to go, but she is beaten and scolded by her stepmother, who leaves her with heavy work that she cannot finish. Kongju's own song best illustrates her unfortunate experience:

    Stepmother wants me to hoe the stony field,
    I wish the sun would never set.
    In my hand is a wooden hoe,
    How hard it is to hoe the stony field.
    Stepmother says, if the stony field isn't hoed,
    She'll strip me naked and drive me away... ... Spinning wheel, oh spinning wheel,
    When will you have a good day,
    Quietly sitting inside the jade railing?
    Father is there,
    Mother is there,
    Only your lonely spinning wheel
    Spins in my hand.

　　But Kongju is not alone. An old yellow ox and a golden boy help her hoe the stony field. Silver star fairies help her fetch water, pound rice, and weave cloth. The fairies know Kongju's desire to attend the prince's banquet at the Half-Moon Palace, so they dress Kongju like a celestial being and send her to the Half-Moon Palace in a flower car. At the dance, the prince does not like the pretentious and ill-tempered Patju at all; he falls in love with the hardworking and kind Kongju. However, Kongju's love and life still have a major twist (this twist is movingly portrayed and fully developed in the opera). Finally, Kongju obtains a good life, while the stepmother and Patju end up in disgrace and receive their due punishment.

　　The playwright of the opera "Kongju and Patju" is a familiar Korean writer, Jo Ryong-chul, and the composer is also a Korean musician we have often heard of, Ri Myon-sang. It is said that the opera began to be written in 1949. The writing was interrupted for a period due to the war of aggression provoked by American imperialism, but under the care of the Korean Workers' Party and the government, the opera was finally completed in a wartime environment. This writing process was truly extraordinary. Because, judging from the work presented before us (the performed opera), we not only admire the Korean artists for completing such a magnificent work in a wartime environment, but also are extremely interested in why this theme so attracted the authors? What viewpoints and methods did the authors use to deal with this theme? What was the author's intention? Although we do not know much about Korean literature and art and discussing it would be overestimating ourselves, how should we, as a Chinese audience and as a Chinese artist learning from Korean artists, understand the author's mind?

　　There is a reason why this theme attracted Korean artists and continued to attract them during the anti-aggression war. The Korean people are kind and hardworking, but the Korean people have experienced great suffering for generations. Striving for a better future has become a national characteristic of the Korean people. The story of "Kongju and Patju," from the time it was created by the Korean people, has been circulating everywhere for many years and has been constantly enriched. Therefore, to a certain extent, it reflects this characteristic and aspiration of the Korean people, which is expressed in a very beautiful and moving form. Korean artists who love their country and their people could not fail to be moved and attracted by this story. It is only natural that the artists want to bring this story to the stage in a colorful opera form.

　　Due to their era, environment, and correct viewpoints, Korean artists did not simply bring this story to the stage but also developed it. The author placed the conflict of this play on a broad background. The author emphasized the support Kongju received from the people, Kongju's many contacts with the masses, which originally existed in life, but many of the mass scenes on stage are clearly the result of the artist's hard work. This gave the story new life and brilliance in the anti-American imperialist war of aggression, making this folk tale reflect the life and hope of the Korean people to a greater extent and becoming a force to help people strive for a better life. Of course, doing so would encounter many difficulties, because myths are always products of humanity's childhood. The positive significance, beautiful form, and simple worldview of myths are extremely closely intertwined. Trying to develop its content further would touch on many difficult and complex issues. But it is gratifying that Korean artists have made excellent achievements in this regard, not only successfully shaping the moving image of Kongju, but also making the images of the old yellow ox and the golden boy interesting and lovely. We can feel that the author has entrusted special responsibilities to the yellow ox and the golden boy. Although there are many difficulties, in its current form, it is still harmonious, and after all, the yellow ox and the golden boy have broken into all the important occasions.

　　Musically, the author deliberately portrayed Kongju's musical image, as well as the musical images of the stepmother and the yellow ox. These images are not only distinct in character but also have inner depth. The author also paid full attention to the music of the mass scenes, and the dramatic descriptions of the orchestra also achieved good results. The author especially used leitmotifs for Kongju. Whenever Kongju was about to appear, the orchestra would play phrases describing Kongju's inner world's desire for life and her rebellious nature.

　　The composer's understanding and use of vocal and orchestral music is very skillful. We can feel that the composer has a high degree of cultivation in European classical opera. But we are particularly interested in the composer's efforts to inherit and develop the excellent traditions of Korean national music. We feel this most prominently in the second act of the opera. Kongju's solo expressing her inner feelings, many of the masses' choruses, and the music for the mass dances are all very national in style, lively and vibrant.

　　This opera has another success: it not only reflects the painful life of the people but also reflects the people's confidence in a better future. Despite Kongju's tragic experiences, she still lives resolutely, and the people's just forces finally achieve victory. The optimism that permeates the work not only reflects the brave character of the Korean people but must also have encouraged the Korean people in the difficult years of the war. We should understand the author's intentions in this way and evaluate the noble efforts and achievements of the Korean artists in this way. We should learn from their experience.

　　We did not have the opportunity to see the original version of the opera. All our knowledge and good impressions of "Kongju and Patju" come from the performance. All our feelings and the things we learned should be attributed to the director, conductor, actors, and performers of the Korean Youth Art Troupe. Their performance is highly accomplished. Their performance made me watch it again and again, and many beautiful impressions still flashed in my mind after leaving the theater.

　　We have appreciated Kim Ki-duk's conducting in the past. After seeing "Kongju and Patju," we will remember the names of Kim Ki-duk and director Lee Young-seop for a long time. From the performance, it seems that they cooperated very well. They not only deeply interpreted the work but also made a successful performance. How cleverly and exquisitely the duet between the prince and Kongju hiding behind the big tree was handled in the fourth act! How ingeniously the action of the stepmother preventing Kongju from dancing and revealing the flower shoes in Kongju's arms was designed in the fifth act! And the director (including choreographer Ra Suk-hee) in the second act's handling of the mass dance, fairy dance, and Kongju changing clothes, shows how gratifying achievements they have made in learning from folk dance and classical national opera!

　　The musical level of the actors of the Korean Youth Art Troupe is very high, and it is very uniform. Their realistic and simple performances enable us, who do not understand the Korean language, to understand the content of the play without hindrance. And their young artists seem to already have rich artistic creation experience, especially in the performances of Kang Soon-ja (stepmother), Lee Hyung-sook (Patju), Kim Hyung-ro (Yellow Ox), and Go Jong-ik (King), which made us feel this. The most impressive is Wang Seon-hwa, who plays Kongju. We can see that although she is a young actor, she is a talented actor. Her simple performance and lyrical voice appropriately express the character's personality and reveal the rich inner world of the character to the audience.

　　The orchestra's proficiency quickly attracted the audience's attention, allowing us to effortlessly and unconsciously accept a wealth of things.

　　Finally, I must express my sincere gratitude to the Korean artists. The stage art of "Kongju and Patju" made us further feel the beautiful and majestic mountains and rivers of Korea and further understand the long-standing and great Korean national culture! The story of "Kongju and Patju" will linger and flow like a clear and warm spring in the hearts of the Chinese people. The performance of the Korean artists has enhanced the Chinese people's understanding of the Korean people and enhanced the fighting friendship between the Korean and Chinese people.

　　May our brotherly and fighting friendship develop and increase day by day!

　　美妙动人的歌剧演出
　　记朝鲜青年艺术团演出的“孔菊与潘菊”
　　中国音乐家协会理事　卢肃
    从很久远的年代起，朝鲜人民中间就流传着
  “孔菊与潘菊”的故事，在这个美丽的故事里，体现着朝鲜人民的爱憎分明，体现着朝鲜人民对于反抗压迫和对美好生活的渴望。故事的梗概是这样：一个山村里有一个姑娘名字叫孔菊，这个姑娘失去了自己的亲生母亲，孔菊又善良又勤劳又美丽，但是她却受着继母和继母的女儿潘菊的虐待。继母和潘菊夺走孔菊手里的铁锄，叫她用木锄去锄石田，却把铁锄给潘菊去锄沙田。皇宫里举行王子生日的宴会，很多人都去参加了，孔菊的继母和潘菊也去参加了，孔菊也想去参加，却遭到继母的打骂，继母留给她的是沉重得做不过来的活计。孔菊自己的歌声最能说明她的不幸的遭遇：
    继母要我铲石田，
    但愿太阳不落山。
    手中拿的是木锄，
    要铲石田多么难。
    继母说，石田铲不完，
    要扒光衣服把我赶……，……纺车呀，纺车呀，
    你何时才能有美好的日子，
    安静地坐在玉栏里边？
    爸爸在那里呀，
    妈妈在那里呀，
    只有你孤单的纺车
    在我手中旋转。
    但是孔菊并不是孤独的，老黄牛和金童子帮她锄完了石田，银星仙女们帮她打水、舂米、织布，仙女知道孔菊想去半月宫参加王子宴会的心思，把孔菊打扮得天仙一样，驾着花车把孔菊送到半月宫去。在舞会上，王子一点也不喜欢那个装腔作势好发脾气的潘菊，他爱上了勤劳、善良的孔菊。但是，孔菊的爱情和生活还有一个很大的波折（这个波折在歌剧中有着动人的表现和充分的发展），最后，孔菊得到了美好的生活，继母和潘菊落得个受人唾弃的耻辱的下场，并且受到了应有的惩罚。
    歌剧“孔菊与潘菊”的剧作者是一位我们所熟悉的朝鲜作家赵灵出，作曲者也是我们早已常常听到的朝鲜音乐家李冕相。据说这部歌剧开始写作是在一九四九年，中间因为美帝国主义所挑起的侵略战争，使写作中断了一个时期，但是在朝鲜劳动党和政府的关怀下，这部歌剧在战争环境中最后完成了。这个写作过程真是不平常的。因为从展现在我们眼前的作品（演出的歌剧）来说，我们不但对在战争环境中完成了这样瑰丽的作品的朝鲜艺术家感到敬佩，而且引起我们极大兴趣的是为什么这个题材这样吸引了作者？作者是用什么观点和方法来处理这个题材的？作者的意图是什么？虽然由于我们对朝鲜的文学艺术知道得还不很多，讨论起来有不自量力的困难，但做为一个中国观众、作为一个向朝鲜艺术家学习的中国艺术工作者应该怎样去理解作家的心灵呢？
    这个题材吸引了朝鲜的艺术家，并且在反侵略战争中仍然吸引着朝鲜的艺术家并不是没有理由的。朝鲜人民是善良而勤劳的，但是朝鲜人民世世代代都曾经历过重大的痛苦，争取美好的生活前途已经成了朝鲜人民的民族性格，“孔菊与潘菊”的故事，从朝鲜人民创作它起，许多年代里，到处流传，不断地得到丰富，因而在一定程度上就反映了朝鲜人民的这种性格和企望，这种性格和企望是表现在十分优美动人的形式里，热爱祖国，热爱人民的朝鲜艺术家不会不被这个故事所感动所吸引。艺术家们要把这个故事用多采的歌剧形式搬上舞台，这就是很自然的事了。
    由于自己所处的时代、环境和自己的正确的观点，朝鲜艺术家并不只是把这个故事搬上舞台，而且还使它得到发展。作者把这个戏的纠纷摆在一个广大的背景上，作者强调了孔菊受到人民的支持，孔菊同群众的许多接触，原来就在生活中存在，但舞台上的很多群众场面，很显然是艺术家艰苦劳动的结果，这就使这个故事在反对美帝国主义侵略战争里有了新的生命和光彩，使得这个民间传说在更大的程度上反映了朝鲜人民的生活和希望，并成为帮助人民争取更好的生活的力量。当然，这样做是会碰到很多困难的，因为神话总是人类幼年时代的产物，神话的积极意义，优美形式，世界观的朴素性质是极其紧密地混为一体的，要想把它的内容发展一步就会接触到很多困难和复杂的问题。但是可喜的是朝鲜艺术家们在这方面做出了很好的成绩，不但成功地塑造了孔菊的动人的形象，而且老黄牛和金童子的形象也是有趣和可爱的，我们可以感到作者对黄牛和金童子付予了特别的重托，虽然困难重重，但在现在的形式里还是谐和的，而且黄牛和金童子毕竟是闯进了一切重要的场合。
    在音乐上作者加意刻划了孔菊的音乐形象，刻划了继母和黄牛的音乐形象，这些形象不但性格鲜明，而且有内心的深度。作者对群众场面的音乐，也给予了充分的注意，管弦乐的戏剧性的描写也收到很好的效果。作者特别对孔菊用了主导乐句的方法，每当孔菊要出现时，乐队就传出了描写孔菊内心世界的渴望生活和有反抗性的乐句。
    作曲者对于声乐和管弦乐的了解和运用是很娴熟的。我们可以感到：作曲者对欧洲的古典歌剧是有很高的修养的；但是我们更特别感到兴趣的是作曲者在继承和发展朝鲜的民族音乐的优秀传统上的努力，我们从歌剧的第二幕中最突出地感到这一点，孔菊抒发内心感情的独唱和很多群众的合唱，群众舞蹈的音乐都是很有民族色彩的，生动活泼的。
    这个歌剧还有另一个成功的地方：歌剧不但反映了人民的痛苦生活，而且反映了人民对美好生活前途的信心。尽管孔菊的遭遇是悲惨的，但是孔菊仍然坚决地生活着，人民底正义底力量最后终于得到了胜利。作品中洋溢的乐观主义情绪不但反映了朝鲜人民底勇敢性格，而且也一定在战争艰苦的岁月里鼓舞了朝鲜人民。我们应该这样去理解作者的意图，应该这样去估价朝鲜艺术家高尚的努力和成果。应该学习他们的经验。
    我们没有机会看到歌剧的原作，我们所有关于
  “孔菊与潘菊”的认识和美好印象都是从演出得到的，我们所有的感受和学习到的东西，都应当归功于朝鲜青年艺术团的导演、指挥、演员和演奏者，他们的演出是有高度成就的。他们的演出曾使我看了一次又一次，走出剧场以后许多美好的印象仍然在脑子里闪烁。
    我们过去已经欣赏过金基德的指挥，看了“孔菊与潘菊”以后更将使我们长久记着金基德和导演李永涉的名字，从演出上看来他们合作得非常好，他们不但深刻地解释了作品，并且作了成功的演出。第四幕中王子和躲在大树后的孔菊的二重唱处理得多么巧妙和精湛！第五幕中继母去阻止孔菊跳舞而将孔菊怀里的花鞋显露出来的动作设计得多么巧妙！而导演（包括编舞者罗淑姬在内）在第二幕的群众舞蹈、仙女舞蹈以及孔菊换衣服的处理，表现他们在向民间舞蹈和古典民族歌剧的学习上获得了多么可喜的成就！
    朝鲜青年艺术团的演员们的音乐水平是很高的，并且是很整齐的，他们的现实主义的质朴的表演，使我们这些虽不懂朝鲜语言的人也能无阻碍地领会了剧词的内容。而他们的青年艺术家看来是已经有着丰富的艺术创作经验了，特别在姜顺子（继母）、李炯淑（潘菊）、金炯鲁（黄牛）和高宗益
  （王）的表演上使我们感到这一点。给人印象最深的是王善花扮演的孔菊，我们可以看得出她虽然是年轻的演员但是却是一个天才的演员，她朴素的表演和带有抒情性质的声音，恰如其分地表现了人物的性格，向观众揭示了丰富的人物内心世界。
    乐队的娴熟很快地就吸引了观众的注意，使我们毫不费力地不知不觉中接受了很丰富的东西。
    最后，我想必须以诚恳的谢意来向朝鲜的美术家致意，“孔菊与潘菊”的舞台美术，使我们更进一步感受到朝鲜秀丽雄伟的山川国土，使我们进一步认识了历史悠久的伟大的朝鲜民族文化！“孔菊与潘菊”的故事将像一支清澈的温暖的泉水在中国人民的心里萦回流转，朝鲜艺术家们的演出增进了中国人民对朝鲜人民的认识，增进了朝、中人民的战斗友谊。
    愿我们兄弟般的、战斗的友谊日益发展增进！
