    U.S. Intensifies War Preparations in Taiwan

    Recently, the U.S.'s war preparations in the Taiwan area have noticeably increased. Since U.S. Seventh Fleet Commander Pride announced on October 22nd that the U.S. military command in Taiwan was renamed the "U.S. Taiwan Defense Command," a succession of U.S. officials and high-ranking naval and air force officers have visited Taiwan. These include U.S. Far East Air Force Commander Carter, Ingersoll who will replace Pride as Seventh Fleet Commander, and seven members of the U.S. House of Representatives Armed Services Committee. U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff Twining is also scheduled to arrive in Taiwan on the 11th.

    These U.S. generals do not hide the fact that their purpose in going to Taiwan is to strengthen war preparations in order to use military threats to obstruct the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan. They held meetings with the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan, collected intelligence, and "visited" the Chiang bandit army's exercises. Two congressmen even carried out activities on Jinmen Island, which is close to the Chinese mainland. After visiting Taiwan, Carter openly stated upon arriving in Hong Kong that "the U.S. Air Force is prepared and capable of accepting any order to assist in defending the Far East from any attack by the Chinese Communists."

    This U.S. war preparation is also reflected in the strengthening of U.S. military forces in Taiwan. According to Agence France-Presse, in addition to a jet squadron regularly stationed in Taiwan, the U.S. also has "a large number of U.S. jets stationed on the island" in order to "cooperate" with the Chiang bandit air force to "deal with communist attacks." News reports indicate that "responsible individuals" in Taiwan have stated that the U.S. will ship more Sabre jets to Taiwan. At the same time, according to the British "Foreign Report" magazine, the number of American military aid advisory group members in Taiwan will increase by 500 in the next three months, on top of the current 1,300.

    Meanwhile, the U.S. continues to flaunt its so-called "strength" around China. The U.S. Far East Air Force conducted large-scale exercises in Okinawa, Korea, and Japan from November 3rd. The navies of the United States, Britain, and Pakistan of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization held joint exercises in the South China Sea on the same day. Under the instigation of the United States, the Chiang Kai-shek clique also eagerly conducted so-called "joint land, sea, and air attack exercises" and "amphibious combat exercises" in Jinmen and Mazu in early November.

    While the Sino-U.S. talks are in progress, the U.S.'s intensified war preparations in Taiwan and military threats against China are clearly attempts to put pressure on China and force China to agree to the U.S. occupation of Taiwan. The U.S. attempts to abuse the principle of not using force in international relations, demanding that China abandon its sovereignty over its own territory of Taiwan, while the U.S. itself is constantly strengthening its armed occupation of Taiwan and openly using military threats to obstruct China from exercising its sovereignty and infringing on China's independence. This behavior of the United States proves that it is the United States itself, and no one else, that should abandon the use of force in the Taiwan area.

    However, military threats against the Chinese people can never intimidate the Chinese people or make them give up their determination to liberate Taiwan. The sooner the U.S. recognizes this, the sooner the situation in the Far East may be eased and stabilized. Now is the time for the U.S. to show the world whether it is truly willing to have peace in the Far East.

### 美国加紧在台湾备战

    美国加紧在台湾备战
    最近，美国在台湾地区的备战活动显然有了增加。从美国第七舰队司令普赖德在十月二十二日宣布美国在台湾的军事指挥机构改称为“美军协防台湾司令部”以来，已经陆续有许多美国官员和海空军的高级军官访问了台湾，其中有美国远东空军司令卡特，将要接替普赖德充当第七舰队司令的英格索尔，美国众议院军事委员会的七名委员。美国空军参谋长特文宁也预定在十一日到达台湾。
    这些美国将军们并不掩饰他们去台湾的目的是为了加强战争准备，以便用武力威胁来阻挠中国人民解放台湾。他们在台湾和蒋介石集团举行会议，收集情报，“参观”蒋贼军的演习。有两名众议员并且到紧靠着中国大陆的金门岛上去进行了活动。卡特在访问台湾以后到达香港时公然说，“美国空军已经作好准备，它有能力和可以接受协助保卫远东不受中国共产党的任何攻击的任何命令。”
    美国这种战争准备也表现在美国在台湾的军事力量的加强上。据法新社报道，美国除了经常驻有一个联队的喷气机在台湾以外，还有“大批美国喷气机驻在这个岛屿上”，以便同蒋贼空军“合作”“对付共产党的攻击”。有消息说，美国在台湾的“负责人士”表示，美国将把更多的佩刀式喷气机运往台湾。同时，据英国“外事报道”杂志报道，在台湾的美国军事援助顾问团的人数在今后三个月内将比现在的一千三百人再增加五百人。
    同时，美国在中国周围继续炫耀它的所谓“实力”。美国远东空军从十一月三日起在冲绳、朝鲜和日本地区内进行了大规模演习。东南亚集团的美国、英国和巴基斯坦的海军在同一天在南海上举行了联合演习。在美国的鼓舞之下，蒋介石集团也跃跃欲试地在十一月初在金门和马祖接连举行了所谓“陆海空联合攻击演习”和“两栖战斗演习”。
    在中美会谈正在进行的时候，美国在台湾加强战争准备，对中国进行武力威胁，显然是企图对中国施加压力，迫使中国同意美国侵占台湾。美国一方面企图滥用在国际关系中不使用武力的原则，要求中国放弃对自己的领土台湾行使主权，而美国自己却不断加强对中国台湾的武装占领，并且公然以武力威胁来阻挠中国行使自己的主权，侵犯中国的独立。美国的这种行为证明在台湾地区应该放弃武力的不是别人，恰恰就是美国自己。
    但是，对中国人民进行武力威胁，在任何时候都不能吓倒中国人民而使中国人民放弃解放台湾的决心。美国越早认识这一点，远东局势就会早一天有可能得到和缓和稳定。现在是美国向全世界表明它究竟是否愿意远东有和平的时候了。
