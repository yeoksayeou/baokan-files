Xinhua News Agency, October 31st -- To celebrate the 38th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China and the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters have decided to hold a "Soviet Film Week" in thirty cities across the country from November 7th to 21st.

During the Film Week, three excellent Soviet color feature films will be screened: "True Friends," "Marina's Destiny," and "Developing Courage."

"True Friends" is a highly accomplished comedy that won the "Grand Prize" at the Eighth Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in Czechoslovakia. The film tells the story of three true friends who, to fulfill a childhood promise, take a river trip during their vacation. It poetically depicts the beautiful life of Soviet society, sharply satirizes bureaucratic leadership styles that are detached from reality, and portrays the simple, humble character of Soviet people and their sincere friendship in offering candid criticism of comrades' shortcomings.

"Marina's Destiny" depicts the life and experiences of Marina, a female collective farm member. She is abandoned by her husband, but she does not become despondent and finds true happiness in selfless labor. The film movingly narrates the life of a Soviet collective farm today, showcasing the spiritual qualities, noble moral character, and growth of advanced Soviet women within the labor collective. It powerfully attacks the remaining bourgeois ideology.

"Developing Courage" is adapted from the novella "School" by the famous Soviet children's literature writer Gaidar and won the "Educational Film Award" at the Eighth International Film Festival. The film depicts the growth of the young protagonist, Grigoryev, from an ordinary child to a brave Red Army soldier and a glorious Communist Party member. The film truthfully portrays the scenes and struggles of the Soviet Civil War, movingly narrating the training and growth of Soviet youth in these years of struggle. The film is filled with the boundless enthusiasm of people fighting for the lofty ideals of communism.

The thirty cities participating in the "Soviet Film Week" are: Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Shenyang, Anshan, Lüda, Fushun, Harbin, Qiqihar, Changchun, Hohhot, Taiyuan, Jinan, Qingdao, Hangzhou, Nanjing, Fuzhou, Hefei, Nanchang, Wuhan, Nanning, Changsha, Zhengzhou, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming, Xi'an, Lanzhou, and Ürümqi.

Xinhua News Agency, October 31st -- Beijing held consecutive Soviet film report meetings on the 30th and 31st. Writers and film critics introduced the three films that will be screened during the Soviet Film Week, including "True Friends," to the audience.

    “培养勇敢精神”是根据苏联著名儿童文学作家盖达尔的中篇小说“学校”改编的，曾荣获第八届国际电影节“教育片奖”。片中描写小主人公葛利果夫从一个普通的孩子到一个勇敢的红军战士、光荣的共产党员的成长过程。影片真实地表现了苏联国内战争时期的图景和斗争，动人地叙述了苏联青年在这些斗争年代里的锻炼和成长。影片充满着人们为共产主义的崇高理想而战斗的无限热情。
