　　Exquisite Hangzhou Brocade Craftsmanship

    World-renowned Hangzhou brocade is a famous type of Zhejiang's many fine arts and crafts. It uses lustrous colored silk to reflect natural scenery and human figures onto the fabric surface through pictures, weaving a variety of colorful and magnificent silk products. Besides portraits of great figures, the subjects are often famous scenic spots, historical sites, famous paintings, and folk tales from various places. Famous examples include Distant View of Tiananmen, the Kremlin, Interior View of the Summer Palace, Bronze Ox of Beijing, Nine-Dragon Wall, Panoramic View of West Lake, Lingyin Temple in Snowy Weather, Leifeng Pagoda at Sunset, Huangpu River in Shanghai, the Great Wall, Tiger Hill in Suzhou, White Pagoda of Liaoning, A Corner of Mount Lu, Ancient Pines of Mount Tai, Lotus Peak of Mount Huangshan, and Awakening Lion, Flock of Geese, as well as Autumn Hunting, Magu Presenting Longevity, Five Relationships, and more than a thousand other designs and varieties. According to size specifications, they can be divided into twenty-seven types. These brocades are not only harmoniously colored, gorgeous, and lovely, but also vividly depict the images, reflecting the excellent folk art of ancient China. The finished products are sold far and wide, both domestically and internationally, and have been welcomed by the broad masses of people. Many international friends who came to Hangzhou and visited the Hangzhou Brocade Factory praised the brocade craftsmanship as a wonderful creation of the Chinese working people and an honor for Chinese workers.
    China's brocade craftsmanship originated in the Tang Dynasty, more than a thousand years ago. Hangzhou's brocade craftsmanship inherited the excellent techniques of the past and developed them creatively. It has a history of more than thirty years. The Hangzhou Du Jinsheng Silk Weaving Factory, founded in 1922, was the first brocade craft factory in Hangzhou. Subsequently, the Hangzhou Qiwen, Jincheng, and other silk weaving factories were established successively. Before liberation, this kind of fine art craft was not valued. Coupled with the destruction during the reactionary rule, Hangzhou's brocade suffered from poor equipment, low output, and high costs, which affected sales for a long time. After liberation, the People's Government used methods such as supporting production and helping to open up sales channels to develop this fine art craft that enriches people's lives. After the Hangzhou Du Jinsheng Silk Weaving Factory implemented the joint state-private ownership in April 1954, the workers' enthusiasm for production was even higher. Ni Haoshan, the director of the pattern-making department and a veteran draftsman of this factory, recalled his drawing life over the past twenty years when drawing portraits of leaders of various countries, and deeply realized that his works were not simply for people to enjoy, but that people were appreciating his works with respect for the leaders, and therefore felt very honored. He also expressed his willingness to teach the young workers the techniques he had previously considered difficult to teach easily, without reservation. Bian Renlian, a model worker of Hangzhou City and a repairman, with the help of the factory's Party organization and the support of the workers, used his brains and successfully test-produced a five-color carpet using electric looms in December last year. This not only liberated the workers from the heavy labor of handlooms, but also increased the output sixfold and reduced the cost by twenty percent.

　　精美的杭州织锦工艺
　　屠正峰
    闻名世界的杭州织锦，是浙江许多美术工艺品中著名的一种。它用富有光泽的色丝，把自然景物和人的形象，通过图片反映到织物面上来，织成各种各样色泽瑰丽的丝织品。除伟人像外，一般的取材多是各地的名胜古迹、名画以及民间故事。著名的有天安门远景、克里姆林宫、颐和园内景、北京铜牛、九龙壁、西湖全景、灵隐瑞雪、雷峰夕照、上海黄浦江、万里长城、苏州虎邱、辽宁白塔、庐山一角、泰山古松、黄山莲花峰和醒狮、群鹅以及秋林狩猎、麻姑献寿、五伦图等一千多样花色品种。按尺寸的规格可分为二十七种。这些织锦不但色泽调和、瑰丽可爱，而且形象逼真，反映了我国古代优秀的民间艺术。成品远销中外，获得了广大人民的欢迎。不少的国际友人来到杭州，参观了杭州织锦厂以后，赞美织锦工艺是中国劳动人民的绝妙作品，是中国工人的荣誉。
    我国的织锦工艺创始在唐朝，距今已经有一千多年的历史了。杭州的织锦工艺继承了古代优秀的技术，加以创造发挥，到现在也有三十多年的历史。建厂于一九二二年的杭州都锦生丝织厂，是杭州第一个织锦工艺工厂。接着，杭州启文、锦成等丝织厂相继建立。解放以前，这种美术工艺是不被人重视的，再加上反动统治时期的摧毁，杭州的织锦就长期地由于设备差、产量低、成本高而影响销路。解放以后，人民政府用扶植生产，帮助打开销路等办法，发展了这个丰富人民生活的美术工艺。一九五四年四月，杭州都锦生丝织厂实行公私合营以后，工人的生产积极性更高了。这个厂纹制部主任、老绘图员倪好善在画各国人民领袖像的时候，回忆了过去二十多年来的绘图生活，深深体会到现在自己的作品，并不是单纯地供给人们玩赏，而是人们用尊敬领袖的心情来欣赏自己的作品的，因而感到很光荣。他并表示要把过去认为不可轻易教人的技术，不保留地教给青年工人。杭州市劳动模范、修机工边仁连在工厂党组织的帮助和工人们的支持下，开动脑筋，于去年十二月间试用电力机织五彩台毯成功，这不仅使工人们解脱了笨重的手织机的劳动，而且产量也比以前提高了六倍，成本降低了百分之二十。
