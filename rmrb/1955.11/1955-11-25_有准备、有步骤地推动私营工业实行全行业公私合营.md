　　Promote the Implementation of Full Industry-Wide Public-Private Partnership in Private Industry in a Prepared and Step-by-Step Manner
    Recently, many regions have implemented full industry-wide public-private partnerships in several private industrial enterprises. In Shanghai's light industry, eight industries, including cotton spinning, wool spinning, cigarette, enamel, and flour, have implemented public-private partnerships across the entire industry. Thirteen industries in heavy industry, such as shipbuilding, steel rolling, machinery, and electrical appliances, have also implemented or are in the process of implementing public-private partnerships across the entire industry (some are partnerships involving the majority of the industry). Other cities, such as Tianjin's papermaking industry, Beijing's flour, motor, pharmaceutical, and nine other industries, Guangzhou's sewing machine industry, paint industry, and Hangzhou's silk industry, have all successively implemented public-private partnerships across the entire industry. The transformation of private commerce has also begun to adopt this method, such as Beijing's cotton cloth industry, traditional Chinese medicine industry, and Shanghai's woolen yarn industry, all of which have implemented public-private partnerships across the entire industry or the majority of the industry.
    Public-private partnership is an advanced form of state capitalism. Private enterprises that have been incorporated into intermediate or primary forms of state capitalism must gradually transition to socialism through the form of public-private partnership. In public-private partnership enterprises, the socialist component is in a leading position, which is conducive to reorganizing and transforming its production and operation according to socialist principles, and is conducive to the ideological transformation of bourgeois elements. Before 1954, the expansion of public-private partnership was mainly carried out through individual partnerships with a few larger private enterprises, which was suitable for the actual situation at the time. However, with the gradual progress and deepening of socialist transformation, the state must adopt a policy of comprehensive planning, overall arrangement, and active transformation of private industry and commerce. The individual partnership method is obviously no longer suitable for today's comprehensive transformation requirements.
    In China's private industry, large-scale factories are only a minority, while the vast majority are small and medium-sized factories, which are not only scattered in production, but also generally have simple equipment and backward technology. According to the statistics of 1954, among the more than 130,000 private factories in the country, only more than 5,000 employed more than 50 workers, while more than 90,000 employed less than 10 workers; modern industry accounted for only about 20%, and handicraft industry accounted for about 80%. In terms of private commerce, it is even more scattered. If only a few larger enterprises with better production and management are to implement public-private partnership, it will inevitably increase the difficulty of arranging and transforming the majority of small and medium-sized enterprises. These numerous small and backward private enterprises cannot improve their production technology or improve their management without going through a process of reorganization and transformation. However, if only mergers and reorganizations are carried out without direct leadership from the socialist component, many problems will still be difficult to resolve satisfactorily. At the same time, if individual public-private partnerships are adopted for these millions of private industrial and commercial enterprises, it will cause serious dispersion and waste of state funds and make it difficult to allocate cadres. This method will inevitably slow down the progress of transformation and fail to meet the requirements of national socialist industrialization and agricultural collectivization, and fail to meet the requirements of building a socialist society in the main in about three five-year plan periods.
    Full industry-wide public-private partnership is a new form of socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. This form is more conducive to implementing the state's policy of comprehensive planning and overall arrangement for private industry and commerce. The implementation of full industry-wide public-private partnerships in private enterprises can unify the allocation and rational use of manpower (technology, labor) and materials (equipment, capital) of each enterprise, and can make appropriate adjustments between industries and regions, solving their difficulties in changing careers and relocating factories under private ownership; it can give full play to the role of large enterprises leading small enterprises and advanced enterprises leading backward enterprises, so that the production technology of each enterprise can be improved and the management can be improved, preparing conditions for further socialist transformation. After the implementation of full industry-wide public-private partnerships, capitalists and their agents will generally have the opportunity to receive education and transformation, and the progressive core elements in the bourgeoisie will have more favorable conditions to play their role and influence. After the implementation of full industry-wide public-private partnerships, the socialist economic component will establish a leading position in the entire industry, and the production and operation of the entire industry can be completely incorporated into the track of the national plan. Undoubtedly, this will be a major step in the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, and will be of decisive significance for gradually eliminating exploitation and changing the ownership of the means of production by capitalists.
    The implementation of full industry-wide public-private partnership is not to implement the entire private industry in its original form, but to combine it with the production reorganization and economic reorganization of the entire industry on the basis of overall planning. The experience of various regions in overall planning of private industry and commerce in the past few months has proved that due to the decentralization of private industry and commerce and the backwardness of management methods, the confusion of production systems, and the irrationality of regional distribution, it is actually difficult to arrange them simply from the perspective of allocating production tasks. Each industry and each enterprise must undergo more or less production reorganization and economic reorganization in order to change their unbalanced situation. There are only two ways for the development of numerous small and medium-sized enterprises: one is the capitalist road, which is the big fish eating the small fish, and the big enterprises merging the small enterprises. This is a road that makes a few capitalists rich and most people suffer bankruptcy and unemployment, which we resolutely oppose. The other road is to carry out production reorganization and economic reorganization on them, and gradually change their decentralized and backward state according to the principle of large enterprises leading small enterprises and advanced enterprises leading backward enterprises, and improve the production level of the entire industry, which is a socialist method.
    In the process of carrying out full industry-wide production reorganization and economic reorganization in various regions, there are currently several specific practices: (1) Large enterprises lead small enterprises, and advanced enterprises lead backward enterprises; (2) Under the leadership of the state-owned economy, joint production and joint operation are implemented; (3) Several enterprises cooperate with each other and rely on each other, or merge under other suitable conditions, to make up for deficiencies and give play to the role of advanced enterprises leading backward enterprises; (4) A small number of enterprises that are too backward and have no conditions for transformation will be eliminated, and their personnel will be placed in other factories; (5) Under necessary and possible conditions, some enterprises will be relocated to facilitate development; (6) After adjustment or merger, the variety of products will be changed or the reorganization will be transferred to other needed industries.
    The implementation of full industry-wide public-private partnership is not to completely disrupt the original production system and start a completely new set of things; rather, it is to carry out necessary mergers and reorganizations on the basis of overall planning and in accordance with the needs of developing production, and to carry them out in a more step-by-step manner. For example, in Shanghai's recent full industry-wide public-private partnership of the private cotton spinning industry, the original production systems of Shenxin, Wing On, and Lixin (each of which has several factories) were merged according to the system, some small factories that could not be maintained independently were merged, and some factories were merged independently. At the same time, full industry-wide partnership must be carried out step by step according to the different conditions of different regions, different industries, and different enterprises. If all the enterprises in an industry have the conditions for public-private partnership, all of them can be partnered; if the majority of the enterprises in an industry have the conditions for partnership, the majority of the enterprises can be partnered first; if some individual capitalists have not considered the partnership maturely, they can be allowed to wait and see; some industries have very few households, large-scale enterprises, or have other special circumstances, and individual partnerships can also be implemented.
    The implementation of full industry-wide public-private partnership will inevitably encounter ideological resistance from some capitalists. First of all, they should be made to understand that from processing orders to public-private partnerships, from private ownership of enterprises to public-private joint ownership, is a major change. This change meets the requirements of the people of the whole country, conforms to the fundamental policies of the state stipulated in our constitution, and is the general trend, which is inevitable. It is impossible to maintain the decentralized and backward state of capitalism for a long time. Secondly, in the process of production reorganization and economic reorganization, some capitalists of large enterprises are afraid of being burdened after merging with small enterprises and require "matching"; some capitalists of small enterprises have negative dependence emotions and are afraid of "not being able to open up" after merging with large factories. Some capitalists even take the opportunity to withdraw funds, place private individuals, and even sabotage production and other resistance behaviors, which will seriously hinder the smooth progress of reorganization and transformation. These incorrect ideas and practices should be criticized. The merger of backward enterprises into advanced enterprises may have some impact on advanced enterprises, but from the overall perspective, doing so is in line with long-term interests. Large enterprises and advanced enterprises have the responsibility to lead small enterprises and backward enterprises, which is exactly different from the capitalist system. They must treat the reorganization work from an overall perspective and should not only proceed from personal interests. If the capitalists of private enterprises do this, they will have made a contribution to the country and the people.
    Compared with individual partnership, full industry-wide public-private partnership is a more complex and arduous task. This is not only because of its large number and wide scope, but also because this partnership is a comprehensive transformation of the capitalist economy in a region, a department, or in different regions and different departments. Before carrying out full industry-wide public-private partnership, full preparations must be made, and a series of political and economic work must be done, especially ideological education work for capitalists. All regions must conduct comprehensive planning under the unified leadership of the Party committees and governments, and carry out the work in a planned, step-by-step, and batch-by-batch manner to avoid all possible errors and losses. At the same time, we must also rely on the strong support of the masses of workers in private factories, and we must carry out in-depth policy and ideological education work for them. We must give full play to the enthusiasm of the progressive core elements in the industrial and commercial circles, and give full play to the positive role of organizations such as the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, the China Democratic National Construction Association, and trade associations. Only in this way can we combine from top to bottom, have consistent steps, reduce resistance, increase assistance, and make the work of full industry-wide public-private partnership progress smoothly.

### 有准备、有步骤地推动私营工业实行全行业公私合营

　　有准备、有步骤地推动私营工业实行全行业公私合营
    最近有不少地区对若干私营工业企业进行了全行业的公私合营。上海轻工业中已有棉纺、毛纺、卷烟、搪瓷、面粉等八个行业整个行业实行公私合营；重工业的船舶、轧钢、机器、电器等十三个行业，也已经或者正在进行整个行业的公私合营（有的是行业的大部分进行合营）。其他城市如天津的造纸业，北京的面粉、电机、制药等九个行业，广州的缝纫机业、油漆业，杭州的丝绸业等整个行业都先后实行了公私合营。对私营商业的改造也已开始采取这一办法，如北京的棉布业、国药业，上海的绒线业，都是整个行业或行业的大部分实行公私合营的。
    公私合营是国家资本主义的高级形式，已经纳入国家资本主义中级或初级形式的私营企业，基本上都要通过公私合营的形式逐步向社会主义过渡。在公私合营企业中社会主义成分居于领导地位，因而就有利于依照社会主义的原则对它的生产和经营进行改组和改造，并有利于对资产阶级分子进行人的改造。一九五四年以前，在扩展公私合营的方式上，主要是对少数规模较大的私营企业进行个别合营，这种方式是适合当时实际情况的。但随着社会主义改造工作的逐步进展和深入，国家对私营工商业必须采取全面规划、统筹安排、积极改造的方针，个别合营的方式显然已不能适应今天全面改造的要求了。
    我国私营工业中，规模大的工厂只是少数，而为数众多的是中小型工厂，它们不仅在生产上是分散的，而且一般设备简陋，技术落后。根据一九五四年的统计，全国十三万多家私营工厂中雇用职工五十个人以上的只有五千多家，而雇用职工不足十个人的有九万多家；现代工业只占百分之二十左右，工场手工业占百分之八十左右。私营商业方面，更为零星分散。如果只是就少数规模较大，生产经营较好的实行公私合营，势必会增加了安排和改造多数的中小企业的困难。这些为数众多的中小的落后的私营企业，如果不经过改组、改造的过程，是不可能提高它们的生产技术，改进它们的经营管理的。但是如果仅仅进行合并改组，没有社会主义成分直接领导，许多问题，仍然很难得到圆满解决。同时，如果对这些为数几百万的私营工商业都采取个别公私合营的办法，那就会造成国家资金严重的分散和浪费，并使干部的配备发生困难。这种办法也必然会使改造工作进度迟缓，不能适应国家社会主义工业化和农业合作化发展的要求，不能适应国家在大约三个五年计划时期内，基本上建成社会主义社会的要求。
    全行业公私合营是当前对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造的新形式。这一形式更有利于贯彻实现国家对私营工商业的全面规划、统筹安排的方针。私营企业实行全行业公私合营，就可以对各企业的人力（技术、劳动）、物力（设备、资金）统一调配，合理使用，可以在行业之间、地区之间做适当调剂，解决它们在私营情况下转业和迁厂的困难；可以充分发挥以大带小、以先进带落后的作用，使各企业的生产技术得以提高，经营管理得以改善，为进一步对他们进行社会主义改造准备条件。全行业实行公私合营以后，资本家和资本家代理人将较普遍地得到教育和改造的机会，并且使资产阶级中的进步核心分子有更有利的条件来发挥他们的作用和影响。全行业实行公私合营以后，社会主义经济成分就在全行业中树立了领导地位，全行业的生产和经营就可以完全纳入国家计划的轨道。无疑地，这将是对资本主义工商业实行社会主义改造的一个重大步骤，对逐步消灭剥削、改变资本家生产资料所有制具有决定性的意义。
    实行全行业公私合营并不是把整个私营行业原封不动地全部实行合营，而是在统筹安排的基础上，同全行业的生产改组和经济改组结合进行的。几个月来各地统筹安排私营工商业的经验证明，由于私营工商业的分散和经营管理方法的落后，生产制度的混乱和地区分布的不合理，如果单从分配生产任务上来安排它们，事实上很难做到。每个行业、每个企业都必须进行或大或小的生产改组和经济改组，才能改变它们不平衡的情况。为数众多的中小企业的发展道路不外两种：一种是资本主义的道路，这就是大鱼吃小鱼，大企业吞并小企业。这是一条使少数资本家发财而大多数人遭受破产和失业的痛苦的道路，这条道路是我们坚决反对的。另一条道路，就是对它们进行生产改组和经济改组，根据以大带小、以先进带落后的原则，来逐步改变它们分散落后的状态，提高整个工业的生产水平，这是社会主义的办法。
    各地在进行全行业生产改组和经济改组中，目前具体的做法已经有这样几种：（一）以大带小，以先进带落后；（二）在国营经济领导下，实行联产、联营；（三）若干企业在相互协作依存关系或其他适合的条件下实行合并，以有余补不足，并且发挥以先进带动落后的作用；（四）少数过于落后没有改造条件的，淘汰其企业，把人员安置到其它厂里去； （五）在必要和可能的条件下，有些企业要进行迁移，以利于发展；（六）调整或合并后，改变生产品种或改组后转到其它需要的行业去。
    实行全行业公私合营也不是完全打乱原来的生产体系，完全另搞一套；而是要在统筹安排的基础上，根据发展生产的需要，实事求是地进行必要的合并和改组，并且要更有步骤地进行。例如上海最近对私营棉纺工业的全行业公私合营中，对申新、永安、丽新原有生产系统（它们每个系统都有几个工厂）是采取按系统合营的方式，对一些不能单独维持的小厂是采取合并合营的方式，还有一些厂是对它们采取了单独合营的方式。同时，全行业合营还必须根据各地区、各行业、各企业的不同情况，有步骤地进行。如果一个行业的全部企业都具备了公私合营的条件，就可以全部进行合营；如果一个行业中大部分企业具备了合营条件，就可以先对这大部分企业进行合营；如果还有个别企业的资本家对合营没有考虑成熟，就可以允许他们再看一看，等一等；有些行业户数很少，企业规模较大，或者具有其它特殊情况的，也可以实行个别合营。
    实行全行业公私合营，不可避免地会遇到某些资本家的思想抵触。首先，应该使他们了解，从加工订货到公私合营，从企业的私有到公私共有，是个重大的变化。这个变化适应全国人民的要求，符合于我国宪法所规定的国家根本政策，是大势所趋，势所必至的。要想长期维持资本主义的分散落后的状态是不可能的。其次，在进行生产改组和经济改组中，一些大企业的资本家，害怕同小企业合并以后背上包袱，要求“门当户对”；一些小企业的资本家有消极依赖情绪，害怕同大厂合并以后“吃不开”。更有的资本家乘机进行抽逃资金、安插私人乃至破坏生产等抗拒行为，这都将严重地阻碍改组、改造工作的顺利进行。对于这些不正确的想法和做法，应该加以批评。落后的企业并入先进的企业，对先进企业可能有些影响，但是从全局来看，这样做符合于长远的利益。大企业、先进企业有带动小企业、落后企业的责任，这正是同在资本主义制度下不同的地方，他们必须从全局观点来对待改组工作，不应该只从个人利益出发。私营企业的资本家这样做了，他们也就对国家对人民有了一分贡献。
    全行业公私合营比起个别合营来，是一项更为复杂、更为艰巨的工作。这不仅是因为它的数量大、牵涉的面广，而且因为这种合营是在一个地区、一个部门或在不同地区、不同部门中对资本主义经济的全面改造。在进行全行业公私合营以前，必须充分做好准备，做好一系列的政治工作和经济工作，特别是对资本家的思想教育工作。各地必须在党委和政府的统一领导下，进行全面规划，有计划、有步骤、分批分期地进行，避免一切可能发生的错误和损失。同时，还必须依靠私营工厂中的工人群众的有力支持，对他们必须进行深入的政策思想教育工作。要充分发挥工商界中的进步核心分子的积极性，充分发挥工商业联合会、民主建国会以及同业公会等组织的积极作用。只有这样，才能上下结合，步调一致，减少阻力，增加助力，使全行业公私合营的工作顺利地进展。
