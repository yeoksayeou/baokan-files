Many Handicraft Production Cooperatives in Shenyang Use Waste Materials to Manufacture Large Quantities of Products

Many handicraft production cooperatives in Shenyang City have used waste materials to manufacture a wide variety of products, saving a large amount of materials for the country.

The Shenyang No. 3 Sewing Production Cooperative used the method of renovating old clothes to make 32,587 various coats, trousers, windbreakers, shirts, undershirts, and work clothes, saving the country more than 249,700 feet of cotton cloth. These clothes are six or seven tenths new, and the price is half that of new ones, which are very popular among farmers. The Shenyang No. 2 and "May 1st" Knitting Production Cooperatives washed and dyed the usable parts of broken socks and knitted them into more than eighty dozens of thick and cheap socks. The five hemp rope production cooperatives in Shenyang City used recycled rope ends and old sacks to produce 98,981 catties of rope, and recently used 430,000 catties of cotton stalk skins to make 320,000 catties of rope, saving the country 345,000 catties of good green hemp. The Shenyang No. 3 Iron Products Production Cooperative used scrap steel to make 29,043 finished products, including more than 10,000 shovels alone. They also used useless spring steel from industrial departments to make steel forks and saw blades; and used scrap rails to make kitchen knives, axes, scissors, etc. In addition, they also used the recycled old steel bars to make various parts for new-style animal-powered farm tools.
