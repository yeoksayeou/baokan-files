Xinhua News Agency, Paris: The French cabinet recognized Sultan Yusuf's right to the Moroccan throne on the 5th. A communique from the cabinet meeting said that the French government believes that Sultan Yusuf's restoration to the throne will pave the way for France and Morocco to negotiate so that Morocco can develop into a "modern, free and autonomous country that maintains mutual dependence with France." The leader of the Moroccan Independence Party, al-Fassi, who is currently in Cairo, said: "Unless this ultimate goal (referring to Morocco's independence) can be achieved, the nationalist struggle in Morocco will have to continue."

    法政府承认优素福的摩洛哥王位
    据新华社讯　巴黎消息：法国内阁在五日承认了优素福苏丹对摩洛哥王位的权利。内阁会议的公报说，法国政府认为优素福苏丹的恢复王位，将为法国和摩洛哥进行谈判以使摩洛哥发展成为一个“同法国保持互相依赖关系的现代化的、自由的自主国家”打开道路。现在在开罗的摩洛哥独立党领袖法席说：“除非能够达到这个最终的目的（按指摩洛哥的独立），否则摩洛哥的民族主义的斗争将不得不继续下去。”
