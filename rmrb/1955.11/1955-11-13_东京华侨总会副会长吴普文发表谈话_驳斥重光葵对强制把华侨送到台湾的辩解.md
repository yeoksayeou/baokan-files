Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 12th: Wu Puwen, Vice President of the Tokyo Overseas Chinese Association, issued a statement on the 11th, refuting the report made by Japanese Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu at the cabinet meeting on the 8th regarding the Japanese government's forcible deportation of Chinese nationals detained in the Hamamatsu "detention center" to Taiwan.

Wu Puwen pointed out that the Japanese government's "repatriation" was carried out under the strict supervision of armed forces such as police and guards throughout. In particular, Hong Quanxiu and six others resisted resolutely because they did not want to be sent to Taiwan. Shen Jiantang, Gu Minsheng, and others were seriously or slightly injured as a result of police beatings. These facts clearly demonstrate that this was "forced repatriation." Shigemitsu Mamoru's claim that this repatriation was in accordance with the "free will" of the Chinese nationals is clearly sophistry.

Wu Puwen emphasized that the Japanese government forcibly "repatriated" these people based solely on the unilateral notification of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. This is an undeniable fact.

Wu Puwen finally pointed out that it should be noted that since the forced repatriation incident occurred, not only the Tokyo Overseas Chinese Association but also newspaper reporters have been prohibited from visiting the people who are still detained in the "detention center" and those who are still hospitalized because they were seriously or slightly injured.

　　东京华侨总会副会长吴普文发表谈话
　　驳斥重光葵对强制把华侨送到台湾的辩解
    新华社十二日讯　东京消息：东京华侨总会副会长吴普文在十一日发表谈话，驳斥日本外务相重光葵在八日内阁会议上关于日本政府把被拘留在滨松“收容所”的中国侨民强制送往台湾经过所作的报告。
    吴普文指出：日本政府的“遣送”是始终在警察和警卫等武装力量的严重监督下执行的。尤其是洪全修等七人因不愿被送往台湾，曾作了坚决的抵抗，沈鉴堂、顾敏生等人因警察的殴打，竟受了重伤或轻伤。这些事实明显地表示了这是“强制遣送”。重光葵所谓这次遣送是按照中国侨民自己的“自由意志”的说法，显然是一种诡辩。
    吴普文强调说：日本政府只是根据蒋介石卖国集团的片面的通知，就把这些人强制“遣送”了。这是不容否认的事实。
    吴普文最后还指出：应该引起大家注意的是，自从强制遣送事件发生后，不仅东京华侨总会，就连新闻记者也都被禁止访问现在还被拘留在“收容所”的人们和因为受了重伤或轻伤还住在病院里的人们。
