The construction site of the Dujiatai flood diversion project in the lower reaches of the Han River is becoming increasingly busy. Large and small boats are densely packed along the banks of the Han River. Porters are constantly unloading machinery and equipment from various places from the ships. Engineers, technicians, and builders from nearby rural areas and Wuhan City have gathered here. The sound of the builders' pile-driving chants often resonates with the broadcasting from the construction site.

The lower reaches of the Han River are a well-known area in the Yangtze River basin that is prone to flooding. The upper and middle reaches of the Han River meander through the valleys of the Qinling Mountains, Daba Mountains, and Wudang Mountains. Its lower reaches pass through the boundless and fertile Jianghan Plain. Because the terrain on both sides of the lower reaches of the Han River is low-lying, before liberation, the Han River often overflowed its dikes, devouring villages and farmland like a ferocious beast. In a major flood in 1935, more than 5.8 million mu of fertile land north of the Han River were flooded, affecting more than 3 million people. Therefore, the Jianghan Plain has a saying that has been passed down through generations: "Shahu Mianyang Prefecture, nine out of ten years are unproductive." After liberation, the people living on both sides of the Han River, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, actively repaired dikes and constructed culverts, while also preparing to fundamentally control the Han River. From the spring of 1950, surveyors began to cross mountains and rivers in the Han River basin to collect data for the planning of the Han River basin. Now, the planning work for the Han River basin is being intensified, and the Dujiatai flood diversion project in the lower reaches of the Han River is an integral part of the overall effort to fundamentally control the Han River.

Standing on the tall dikes in the Dujiatai area, one can see the quietly flowing Han River on the left and the villages densely distributed on the vast plain on the right. However, the river channel in the lower reaches of the Han River becomes narrower as it goes downstream. Every summer, when the water level of the Yangtze River rises, the river surface here is often six or seven meters higher than the plains on both sides due to mutual pressure. People can clearly see the ships coming and going on the Han River from afar. It is here that a reinforced concrete flood diversion gate, more than 410 meters long and with 30 openings, will be built. When floods seriously threaten the people on both sides of the river, the gate can be opened to discharge 4,000 to 5,000 cubic meters of floodwater per second. The floodwater will flow along a 21-kilometer-long and 800-meter-wide flood diversion channel, smoothly into the old flood area in the tail end of the Dongjing River, which covers an area of about 660 square kilometers. After storage and regulation, it will be discharged into the Yangtze River from places such as Tunkou and Dajunshan.

The start of the Dujiatai flood diversion project in the lower reaches of the Han River is inseparable from the help of Soviet water conservancy experts and the collective wisdom of Chinese water conservancy workers. Soviet water conservancy expert Voronin participated in the survey with Chinese engineering designers in the design process of this project. He assisted the designers in formulating a plan to pre-compress the entire foundation of the gate site to enhance the stability of the gate body. Based on his years of accumulated experience, Voronin also provided specific and valuable suggestions in design and construction. Teachers from Wuhan Institute of Water Conservancy, Tsinghua University, Tianjin University and other schools also provided many important opinions.

　　汉水两岸人民的喜事
　　新华社记者　田庄
    汉水下游杜家台分洪工程的工地上越来越繁忙了。大小船只密集在汉水岸边。搬运工人们不停地从船上卸下从各地来的机具和器材。工程师、技术工人以及从附近农村和武汉市赶来的建筑者们，已经汇集在这里。建筑者们的打硪的“号子”声时常和工地上的广播交响起来。
    汉水下游是长江流域一块著名的经常容易泛滥的地区。汉水的上中游蜿蜒曲折地奔流在秦岭、大巴山、武当山的峡谷中，它的下游穿过一望无际的肥沃的江汉平原。因为汉水下游两岸地势低洼，在解放以前，汉水常常漫溢堤防，像猛兽一样吞噬着两岸的村庄和农田。一九三五年的一次大水，汉水北岸被淹良田五百八十多万亩，灾民达三百多万人。所以江汉平原世代流传着“沙湖沔阳州，十年九不收”这样一句话。解放以后，居住在汉水两岸的人民，在共产党和人民政府的领导下，积极培修堤防，兴修涵闸，同时着手准备根治汉水。从一九五零年春天起，勘测人员就开始在汉水流域翻越大山，淌过河流，为汉水流域规划搜集资料。现在，汉水流域规划工作正在加紧进行，汉水下游杜家台分洪工程就是结合根治汉水的一个组成部分。
    站在杜家台一带高大的堤防上望去，左边是静静地流着的汉水，右边是密布在辽阔的平原上的村庄。可是汉水下游的河道越往下越窄，每年夏天当长江水位升高的时候，由于互相顶托，这里的河面往往比两岸平原高六、七公尺。人们远远地就可以清楚地看见汉水上往来的船只。就在这里，一座长四百一十多公尺、三十孔的钢筋混凝土分洪闸将要建筑起来。当洪水严重威胁两岸人民的时候，这座闸打开以后，就可以泄出每秒四千到五千多立方公尺流量的洪水。吞进的洪水将沿着一条长二十一公里、宽八百公尺的分洪道，顺畅地流入面积约六百六十平方公里的东荆河尾闾的旧泛滥区，经过容蓄调节后，再由沌口、大军山等处泄入长江。
    汉水下游杜家台分洪工程的兴工，是同苏联水利专家的帮助和中国水利工作者的集体智慧分不开的。苏联水利专家沃洛宁在这个工程的设计过程中，同中国工程设计人员一起进行了察勘。他协助设计人员订出了对闸址基础全部进行预压以增强闸身的稳固的计划。沃洛宁根据他多年累积的经验，还在设计施工等方面提供了具体珍贵的建议。武汉水利学院、清华大学、天津大学等学校的教师，也提供了很多重要的意见。
