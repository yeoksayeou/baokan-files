　　Old Cooperative Transfers Backbone Personnel to Support New Cooperatives Editor:
    The Minsheng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Nanxi Village, Taigu County, Shanxi Province, was established in 1953. For two years, the cooperative's grain yield has been more than 20% higher than that of individual farmers. This has made the farmers in the whole village see the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives. Therefore, before the autumn harvest this year, in addition to the Minsheng Agricultural Production Cooperative expanding from 79 households to 93 households, two new cooperatives were established in the village, with a total of 86 members. Thus, the number of farm households joining the cooperatives in the whole village accounts for more than 52% of the total number of households (340 households).
    At this time, a new problem emerged: since the backbone strength in the village was excessively concentrated in the old cooperative, such as 20 of the 22 party members in the whole village were in the old cooperative, and most of the leaders of the Communist Youth League and the administrative cadres in the village were also members of the old cooperative, the backbone strength of the two new cooperatives was relatively weak. Under these circumstances, the party branch, after full deliberation and repeated consideration, decided to transfer some party member cadres from the Minsheng Agricultural Production Cooperative to support the new cooperatives and lead the new cooperatives.
    The party branch's decision initially encountered obstacles in its implementation: the cadres who were to be transferred out of the old cooperative were afraid that they would not be able to do a good job after arriving at the new cooperative, and that they would also suffer economically; the cadres remaining in the old cooperative and the members of the old cooperative were also afraid that the work of the old cooperative would be affected by the transfer of cadres. Therefore, everyone was talking about it, and there was a lot of ideological resistance.
    Therefore, the party branch held a series of meetings inside and outside the party, and repeatedly educated the cadres and members of the old cooperative: explaining that the party should lead all farmers to socialism, so the party branch should not only lead the old cooperative well, but also lead the new cooperative well; moreover, according to the future development trend, several cooperatives in the village may be merged, and running any cooperative well now is to enable everyone to reach socialism as soon as possible. Everyone must oppose selfish departmentalism and give full play to the spirit of class friendship and collectivism, and advance together on the road of socialism. After full discussion, the thinking of the cadres and members of the old cooperative was reversed.
    However, some of the transferred cadres still had concerns such as "not being able to eat wheat next year" and "not being able to take away the public accumulation fund." The party branch instructed the old cooperative to handle these issues in accordance with the principle of mutual benefit. If the wheat field of the new cooperative is sown by whom and harvested by whom, then the problem of eating wheat for the cadres transferred from the old cooperative shall be solved by the old cooperative. The land, shareholding fund, production investment, and unvalued farm tools of the cadres transferred from the old cooperative shall be completely taken by them to the new cooperative; the public accumulation fund, public welfare fund, and public property shall be taken to the new cooperative the portion they are entitled to. In doing so, the cadres and members were very satisfied.
    After consultation between the party branch and the Minsheng Cooperative, eight party members (five of whom were cadres of the old cooperative) have been transferred from the Minsheng Cooperative and assigned to the two new cooperatives (four in each cooperative). After these eight party members arrived at their new posts, they were warmly welcomed and supported by the members of the new cooperatives, and were elected to important positions in the new cooperatives. They assured that they would not disappoint the trust of the members, would humbly learn, and run the new cooperatives well. The cadres and members of the old cooperative also expressed that they would exchange experiences more with the new cooperatives and advance together on the road of cooperation.
    The framework of the new cooperatives has been set up, and they are immediately put into production. At present, the two new cooperatives and one old cooperative are all composting fertilizer and planning to hire sheep flocks to tread manure.

### 老社抽调骨干力量支援新社

　　老社抽调骨干力量支援新社编辑同志：
    山西省太谷县南席村民生农业生产合作社是一九五三年建立的。两年以来，社里粮食的产量，比起单干农民来要高两成多。这使全村农民看到了农业生产合作社的优越性，因此，今年秋收以前，除了民生农业生产合作社从七十九户扩大为九十三户以外，村里又成立了两个新社，共有社员八十六户。这样，全村入社农户占总户数（三百四十户）的百分之五十二以上。
    这时候，出现了一个新的问题：由于村里的骨干力量过分地集中在老社，像全村二十二个党员就有二十个在老社里，大部分的青年团的领导人员和村里的行政干部也是老社社员，因此，两个新社的骨干力量就比较弱。在这种情况下，党支部经过充分酝酿，反复考虑，决定从民生农业生产合作社抽调出一部分党员干部，去支援新社，领导新社。
    党支部的决定，在执行中一开始就遇到了阻碍：要被调出老社的干部怕到新社以后工作搞不好，经济上还要吃亏；留在老社的干部和老社的社员也怕调走了干部，老社工作要受影响。因此，大家议论纷纷，思想抵触很大。
    于是，党支部就在党内、党外召开了一连串的会议，向老社的干部和社员们反复进行了教育：说明党要领导全体农民走向社会主义，因此党支部既要领导好老社，也要领导好新社；而且，按照今后发展的趋势，村里几个社都可能会合并的，现在办好那一个社都是为了使大家早日到达社会主义。大家必须反对自私本位思想，发挥阶级友爱和集体主义的精神，在社会主义道路上共同前进。经过充分的讨论，扭转了老社干部和社员的思想。
    但是，有些被调走的干部还有“明年要吃不到麦子”和“带不上公积金”等等的顾虑。党支部就指示老社按照互利原则处理了这些问题。如果新社的麦田是谁种谁收，那末从老社调去的干部吃麦子问题由老社负责解决。从老社调出的干部的土地、股份基金、生产投资、没有作价的农具等，完全由他们带到新社；公积金、公益金和公共财产，将应得的部分带到新社。这样做，干部、社员都很满意。
    党支部和民生社协商以后，已经从民生社抽调了八个党员（其中有五个是老社的干部）分配到两个新社（每社四人）。这八个党员到了新的工作岗位以后，受到了新社社员的热烈欢迎和拥护，经过选举都担任了新社的重要职务。他们保证决不辜负社员们的信任，要虚心学习，办好新社。老社的干部和社员也表示要多同新社交流经验，在合作化的道路上共同前进。
    新社架子搭起来了，马上就投入生产。目前两个新社和一个老社，都在沤肥和筹划雇羊群踩粪。
