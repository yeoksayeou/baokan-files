Since the autumn entered the peak trading season this year, the rural market has been very active. The total retail plan of the national supply and marketing cooperative system for the third quarter has been completed and slightly exceeded.

However, a very noteworthy phenomenon has appeared in the rural market: many goods in many areas are severely out of stock. According to surveys in Jiangsu, Hubei, Guangdong, Henan, and other provinces, many goods are frequently out of stock in rural areas, ranging from dozens to more than a hundred kinds. Farmers are very dissatisfied with this phenomenon, and prices in some areas have even fluctuated at one time. No matter from which aspect, this phenomenon must be eliminated quickly.

This year, the national commodity reserves have increased by 27 percent compared to last year. The commodities prepared by the commercial departments in many regions in the fourth quarter are also much more than in the third quarter. Since this is the case, why are there still shortages of goods in many areas? Moreover, many goods that are out of stock, such as double-wheeled double-share plows, rubber shoes, fabrics, knitwear, sugar, glass, matches, medicines, soap, etc., are actually goods with very sufficient supply?

An important reason is that many commercial workers did not fully estimate the characteristic that the increase in farmers' purchasing power this peak season is very concentrated. And after the phenomenon of goods being out of stock appeared, they have not yet recognized this characteristic in time and effectively improved their work. Last year, many areas in our country suffered from agricultural disasters and reduced production, which was reflected in the rural market, resulting in a relatively weak off-season in the first half of this year. However, this year, there has been a bumper harvest throughout the country, and the agricultural cooperation movement is also developing vigorously. As soon as the autumn harvest was over, after the farmers sold a large number of agricultural products, huge purchasing power was released at the same time, and the rural market immediately showed an unprecedented "peak season is particularly prosperous." This is a good phenomenon of our country's increasingly prosperous economy.

Many grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives and state-owned store staff in the counties have not adapted to the characteristics of this year's rural market, modified and expanded their supply plans. They are worried that stocking up too much goods will accumulate capital, so they would rather have goods out of stock than actively stock up. In October, Liujiang County, Guangxi Province, conducted an inspection of ten grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives and found that 60 of the 120 kinds of general merchandise that were out of stock were due to the grassroots cooperatives setting their sales plans too small and being unwilling to actively stock up. Some grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives are afraid of stockpiling goods, and implement the so-called "stocking up less, stocking up frequently" method. The Chengguan branch of the Zhecheng County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Henan Province stipulates that the stock of fabrics is not allowed to exceed ten bolts; the Shiqiao Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Nanyang County stipulates that the inventory of each type of rubber shoes must not exceed two pairs. In this way, it will inevitably cause the situation of "stocking up every day, out of stock every day."

In order to change this situation, supply and marketing cooperatives must conduct an inventory of existing goods, adapt to the characteristics of the current rural market, and appropriately expand sales plans. The grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives in Hubei Province, in response to the shortage of goods in the market, generally held "three-member" meetings, where salespersons reported consumer demands for goods, storekeepers reported inventory status, and purchasers reported procurement status. Based on the three aspects, sales plans and purchase plans were revised. The revised fourth-quarter sales plan of the entire Hubei Province Supply and Marketing Cooperative system was expanded by more than 20 percent compared to the original plan, and this approach has obviously played a significant role.

Of course, there is a reason why the staff of grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives are afraid of stockpiling goods and are unwilling to actively stock up. Supply and marketing cooperative staff often do not know how much inventory of which goods should be kept in order to meet market needs and avoid shortages. Therefore, they would rather stock up less in order to speed up the turnover of funds. The fundamental way to solve this problem is to determine reasonable commodity reserve quotas based on the nature of the goods, the amount of money sold, the degree of public need, transportation and storage conditions, and to clarify the scope of responsibilities for business, procurement, accounting, and transportation. Mutually supervise and cooperate; instead of adopting a passive approach and desperately compressing reasonable inventory. The board of directors of Shahe Town Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Dongfeng County, Jilin Province, held a meeting to mobilize all staff to analyze the law of commodity sales in previous years, and formulated the reserve quotas of major commodities before the start of the peak season. The result of doing so was very good, not only handling the backlog of commodities, but also preventing the shortage of commodities during the peak season, improving business management, and accelerating the turnover of commodities and funds.

Supply and marketing cooperatives in various places should always take the initiative to grasp the new situation in the market. For example, among the commodities sold in the peak season this year, new agricultural tools, building materials, cultural and medical supplies have increased significantly compared with previous years, and supply and marketing cooperatives should actively organize purchases in a timely manner and try to meet the requirements of the broad masses of farmers. For the slow-moving goods and defective goods in stock, efforts should be made to process and modify them in order to open up sales channels.

The supply plans of state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives must be mutually connected and coordinated. This is also one of the important ways to prevent goods from being out of stock in rural markets. Although state-owned commerce has changed its method of supplying goods to supply and marketing cooperatives, there are still some state-owned commercial departments that do not allocate goods according to the contracts signed with supply and marketing cooperatives; some state-owned commerce allocates unsalable goods to supply and marketing cooperatives, while keeping the best-selling goods for themselves. These practices are very inappropriate. State-owned commerce must earnestly implement the principle of "prioritizing the supply of industrial products needed by both urban and rural areas to rural areas" and try to meet the purchasing requirements of supply and marketing cooperatives. In order to ensure that the supply plans of supply and marketing cooperatives and state-owned commerce can be linked together, the work responsibilities of both parties should be clearly stipulated: if the industrial products responsible for wholesale by state-owned commerce are out of stock in the market due to the failure of supply and marketing cooperatives to purchase goods from state-owned commerce in a timely manner, the supply and marketing cooperatives should be responsible; if the supply and marketing cooperatives submit a purchase plan to state-owned commerce, and state-owned commerce cannot allocate goods according to the contract, or if the supply and marketing cooperatives temporarily require purchases, and state-owned commerce has goods but does not supply them, resulting in a shortage of goods in the market, the state-owned commerce shall be responsible. In this way, we can strengthen the sense of responsibility of relevant departments and urge them to organize the source of goods and actively purchase goods according to the needs of consumers.

Holding supply meetings with the participation of both state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives, exchange meetings within the supply and marketing cooperative system, and commodity exhibitions to exchange information have a positive effect on expanding and balancing the source of goods. The grassroots cooperatives in the ten districts of Huangpi County, Hubei, held a supply meeting with the local state-owned commercial departments, specifically learned about the inventory situation of the state-owned companies, and signed 50 purchase contracts in one go. The Zaoyang County Supply and Marketing Cooperative visited the state-owned company and purchased all 120 baskets of native paper accumulated by the company, immediately eliminating the long-term shortage of native paper in the market. The Jiangling County Supply and Marketing Cooperative system adjusted 33 kinds of commodities between districts through internal exchange meetings, and the phenomenon of stockpiling in one place and out of stock in another place in the past was also eliminated. In many regions, at the supply meetings jointly attended by state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives, a method of combining asking for goods from the bottom up and allocating them from the top down was adopted, stopping the practice of mandatory apportionment and bundled sales, expanding sales plans, and adding commodity varieties. This shows that as long as the connections between all links of the commercial sector are strengthened and they cooperate closely with each other, the shortcomings in the supply work can be quickly overcome and the needs of the rural harvest can be further met.

After the arrival of the peak season, market purchasing power has greatly increased. However, the supply and marketing cooperatives in many regions still maintain the old plan of the proportion of public and private business. This not only deepens the deficiency of market commodity supply, but also condones some private merchants to carry out illegal activities. Because all localities have implemented the policy of "overall consideration, comprehensive arrangement, and active transformation" for private commerce, most regions across the country have achieved the expected results, and general rural private merchants can maintain their operations. Therefore, the part of the increase in rural market purchasing power in the current peak season should be included in the sales plan of socialist commerce to ensure the supply of commodities in the market and the stability of prices.

### 不让农村市场商品脱销

　　不让农村市场商品脱销
　  今年秋季进入贸易旺季以来，农村市场十分活跃。全国供销合作社系统第三季度零售计划总额已经完成，并且稍有超过。
    但是，农村市场上出现了一种非常值得注意的现象：许多地区许多商品严重脱销。根据江苏、湖北、广东、河南等省的调查，农村中许多商品经常脱销，从几十种到一百多种。农民对这种现象很不满意，个别地区的物价甚至一度发生波动。不管从哪一方面来说，都要迅速消除这种现象。
    今年全国的商品储备量比去年增长了百分之二十七。许多地区的商业部门在第四季度准备的商品，也比第三季度多得多。既然这样，为什么许多地区还会出现商品脱销现象呢？而且，许多脱销的商品，例如双轮双铧犁、胶鞋、布匹、针织品、食糖、玻璃、火柴、成药、香皂等等，竟是货源非常充足的商品呢？
    一个重要的原因，就是许多商业工作人员事先没有充分估计到今年旺季农民购买力的增长十分集中的特点。而在商品脱销现象出现以后，他们还没有及时认识这个特点，有效地改进自己的工作。去年我国许多地区农业受灾减产，它反映到农村市场上，就造成今年上半年淡季较淡的情况。但今年全国各地普遍丰收，农业合作化运动又在蓬勃发展，当着秋收刚刚完了，农民大量出售农产品以后，巨大的购买力同时投放出来，农村市场立时表现了前所未有的“旺季特旺”。这是我国经济日益兴旺的好现象。
    许多基层供销社和县的国营商店工作人员并没有适应今年农村市场的特点，修改和扩大供应计划。他们担心进货多了会积压资金，宁肯让商品脱销，也不愿积极进货。广西省柳江县在十月份对十个基层供销社作了检查，发现脱销的一百二十种百货中，有六十种是由于基层社销售计划订的偏小、不愿积极进货而脱销的。有些基层供销社害怕积压商品，实行所谓“少进货，勤进货”的办法。河南柘城县供销社城关门市部规定布匹存货不准超过十匹；南阳县石桥供销社规定各号胶鞋库存不得超过两双。这样，当然会造成“天天进货，日日脱销”的情况了。
    为了改变这种状况，供销合作社要把现有的库存商品进行一次清点，适应当前农村市场的特点，适当扩大销售计划。湖北省的基层供销社针对市场商品脱销的情况，普遍召开“三员”会议，由营业员报告消费者对商品的要求，保管员报告库存商品情况，采购员报告采购情况，根据三方面的情况，修正销售计划和进货计划。全湖北省供销社系统修正的第四季度销售计划比原定计划扩大了百分之二十以上，这种作法显然起了很大的作用。
    当然，基层供销社的工作人员害怕积压商品，不愿积极进货，不是没有原因的。供销社工作人员常常不知道哪些商品应该有多少库存，才能供应市场的需要，避免脱销现象，因此，他们宁愿少进货，以便加速资金的周转。解决这一问题的根本办法是根据商品的性质、卖钱额多少、群众的需要程度、交通运输和保管条件，确定合理的商品储备定额，同时划清业务、采购、会计、运输等方面的职责范围，相互督促和配合；而不是采取消极的办法，拼命压缩合理的库存。吉林省东丰县沙河镇供销社理事会曾召开会议，发动全体工作人员分析往年商品销售的规律，并在旺季开始以前制定了主要商品储备定额，这样做的结果很好，不但处理了积压的商品，而且防止了旺季商品脱销现象，改善了经营管理，加速了商品和资金周转。
    各地供销社应该随时主动掌握市场的新情况。比如，今年旺季销售的商品中，新式农具、建筑材料、文化和医药用品都比往年显著增加，供销社就要及时地积极组织进货，尽量满足广大农民的要求。对于库存的滞销货和残品货，应该设法加工改制，以便打开销路。
    国营商业和供销社的供应计划必须互相衔接，互相配合，这也是防止农村市场商品脱销的重要办法之一。国营商业虽然已经改变了对供销社的供货办法，但是，还有些国营商业部门不按照同供销社签订的合同拨给货物；有些国营商业拨给供销社不适销的商品，而把畅销货留着自己卖。这些做法很不妥当。国营商业必须切实执行“城乡都需要的工业品优先供应农村”的原则，尽量满足供销社进货的要求。为了保证供销社和国营商业的供应计划能够衔接起来，应该明确规定双方的工作责任：凡国营商业负责批发的工业品，因供销社不及时向国营商业进货而造成市场脱销的，应该由供销社负责；供销社向国营商业提出进货计划，国营商业不能按合同拨货，或者供销社临时要求进货，国营商业有货不供应因而造成市场脱销的，由国营商业负责。这样，就可以加强有关部门的责任感，并督促它们按照消费者的需要组织货源，积极进货。
    召开国营商业同供销社双方参加的供应会议、供销社系统内部的交流会、商品展览会等交流情况，对于扩大和平衡货源有积极的作用。湖北黄陂县十个区的基层社同当地国营商业部门举行了一次供应会议，具体地了解了国营公司的库存情况，一次就签订了五十份进货合同。枣阳县供销社参观了国营公司，将公司积存的一百二十篓土纸全部购进，立刻消除了市场上土纸长期脱销的现象。江陵县供销社系统通过内部交流会，在区和区之间调剂了三十三种商品，过去甲地积压乙地脱销的现象也消除了。许多地区在国营商业同供销社共同参加的供应会议上，采取自下而上要货和自上而下分配相结合的方法，停止硬性摊派和搭配出售的做法，扩大了销售计划，增添了商品品种。这就说明，只要加强商业部门各个环节的联系，互相密切配合，就可以迅速克服供应工作上的缺点，进一步满足农村丰收后的需要。
    旺季到来以后，市场购买力大大增长了。但不少地区的供销社仍然维持了旧的公私营业比重计划。这不但加深了市场商品供应不足的缺陷，而且纵容了某些私商进行违法活动。由于各地对私营商业贯彻执行了“统筹兼顾，全面安排，积极改造”的政策，全国多数地区已收到预期成效，一般农村私商都能维持下来。因此，当前旺季农村市场购买力增长的部分，应该列入社会主义商业的销售计划之内，以保证市场商品的供应和物价的稳定。
