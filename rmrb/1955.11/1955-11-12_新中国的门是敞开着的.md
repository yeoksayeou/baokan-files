　　The Door to New China is Open
　　By Stephen Kennedy, American political commentator

　　When I was a young student in American public school, I was briefly told that in the early twentieth century, the United States had played a leading role in establishing the "Open Door" policy, which guaranteed equal opportunities for all countries to trade with China. With the innate patriotic piety of children, we imagined that the Chinese people must be very grateful for this help from the United States.

　　When I read in textbooks that the United States fought in 1812 to defend "freedom of the seas," I also felt very proud, because Britain was brutally interfering with our shipping. Moreover, when I read about how the U.S. Navy had swept across the Mediterranean, wiping out the barbaric pirates along the coast, I felt proud to be an American. I could also understand why Americans joined World War I when the German Emperor ordered his submarines to sink our ships on the high seas.

　　It was only later, when I studied more objective things outside of American textbooks, that I discovered how much imperialist intention was mixed in these actions. Even so, I know that most American soldiers, like the children in our school, were immersed in ideals and did not pay attention to what was hidden behind them.

　　But where are the American warriors who defend "freedom of the seas" now?

　　Demonstrating everywhere along the Chinese coast, committing the most heinous crime of violating the freedom of the high seas in history!

　　The Korean War, which broke out more than five years ago, became an excuse to order the U.S. Seventh Fleet to "neutralize" the waters near Taiwan. Since then, the American press has tried to convince the public that the Seventh Fleet is only doing this much.

　　I must admit that it was not until I visited China not long ago that I fully realized the geographical scope of the Seventh Fleet's aggressive actions in Chinese territorial waters. The Seventh Fleet patrols everywhere within a thousand nautical miles from Shantou in the south to Qingdao in the north. But these warships are not just minding their own business, they are supporting a pirate fleet composed of "American-made" ships and aircraft commanded by Chiang Kai-shek. In recent years, with the connivance of the Seventh Fleet, and based on intelligence provided by the U.S. Air Force and intelligence agencies, the Chiang Kai-shek gang has detained, intercepted, attacked, looted, or sunk more than 600 merchant ships. In addition to Chinese ships, ships from Britain, the Netherlands, Norway, Denmark, Greece, Italy, West Germany, Panama, Poland, and the Soviet Union have also been victimized.

　　When I learned these facts, I couldn't help but think: what would the American people feel if China, or anyone else, had a fleet patrolling the American coast from New York to Savannah, protecting a pirate fleet that plundered our ships!

　　Although I have not seen the Seventh Fleet in action, I am very glad that I have not seen it. I am afraid that when the American Stars and Stripes flutter by, I would hallucinate the skull and crossbones of a "pirate flag". I know this is an exaggeration, but when I traveled in Latin America, North Africa, and elsewhere, I did see the American flag being used to cover up so many dirty imperialist tricks, so I really can't stand those who tarnish our national flag. And I am sure that the entire American people will never sympathize with the militaristic schemes that attempt to expand the imperialist rule of Wall Street.

　　In Beijing, I visited a natural history exhibition and saw a large map of China with electric buttons inlaid on it, with the words: gold, silver, copper, iron, coal, oil, etc. When the guide pressed these buttons in succession, colored lights flashed in every place where a certain mineral deposit had been discovered, and when all the buttons were pressed, the whole of China shone like a huge treasure chest.

　　A light also flashed in my mind.

　　I thought: "This is not the only map like this in the world. On Wall Street, there are people who also have such maps on the walls of their modern offices, and those flashing lights have driven them so crazy that they are still dreaming of 'opening' China and plundering its wealth. This is the reason why the U.S. Seventh Fleet is cruising in the Chinese seas!"

　　Of course, these guys would never admit that they have such intentions. But the leaders of the American fascist gang are more straightforward than them. Their mission is to set the American people against each other in terms of race, religion, and political beliefs. I once participated in such an organization in order to expose them, and I still remember what J.B. Stoner, the head of a state of the Ku Klux Klan, said to me.

　　He declared: "The United States must build up a force that is strong enough to enable us to demand whatever we want from any other country and make them all act according to our will!"

　　Klan minister A.K. Shuler added, "General MacArthur is absolutely right to insist that we should pay attention to the Far East first. The future of the world – the wealth – is there!"

　　What I saw during my two-month visit to New China is enough to tell anyone who may have the idea of re-"opening" China for imperialist exploitation: "That's impossible!"

　　I also saw other things in China. In the spacious new Overseas Chinese Hotel in Beijing, Western businessmen are constantly coming and going, disregarding Dulles' ban, with smiles on their faces and lucrative contracts in their pockets. But Americans are particularly conspicuous by their absence.

　　If the American business community wakes up, even for its own benefit, it will see what a wonderful opportunity it has lost. China's natural wealth is indeed abundant; and her 600 million people provide an unlimited market. Socialist New China, single-mindedly trying to improve the purchasing power of the people, is developing its industry and is systematically discovering and developing its natural resources, and certainly provides a better commercial future for American industry than feudal old China.

　　Of course, nothing could be clearer to the United States than this: continuing on the current path will be both ineffective and harmful; it is not leading to the isolation of China, but to the isolation of the United States. The embargo is hurting capitalist countries in many ways, more than it was originally intended to hurt socialist countries. For example, by severing Japan's traditional trade with China, American industry has to compete with Japanese industry, and American taxpayers have to cough up many dollars to maintain the turbulent Japanese economy. American industrialists, like ordinary American taxpayers, can benefit from advocating the lifting of the embargo. The American people, like the Chinese people, expect Geneva to achieve this.

　　As the first independent American observer invited to step through the door of New China, I can report that the door that was open to imperialist plunder has been closed forever. I would strongly urge my Uncle Sam to forget any fantasies he may have about breaking in and looting.

　　On the other hand, if American businessmen are half as smart as their reputation for shrewdness suggests, they will resolutely abandon interference in the internal affairs of other countries, adhere to the principle of fair trade based on mutual benefit, withdraw the Seventh Fleet, and send their cargo ships.

　　Thus, the door to New China is open.

　　新中国的门是敞开着的
　　美国政论作家　史·肯尼迪
    当我还是美国公立学校的一个小学生的时候，就被简略地告诉说，在二十世纪初期，美国在树立
  “门户开放”政策上曾经起着倡导的作用，这个政策保证了各国对华贸易的机会均等。本着儿童天生的爱国虔诚，我们想像中国人民对于美国的这种帮助一定是十分感激的。
    当我从课本里读到美国在一八一二年为维护“海洋自由”而打仗的时候，也感觉到很自豪，因为英国横暴地干涉我们的航运。而且当我读到美国海军曾经怎样扫荡沿岸的野蛮海盗而横渡地中海的时候，我以自己身为一个美国人而感到骄傲。还有，我也可以理解为什么当德皇命令他的潜水艇在公海上击沉我们的船只，美国人就参加了第一次世界大战。
    只是到了后来，当我研究了美国的课本以外的更多的客观事物的时候，我才发觉到在这些行动中掺杂有多少帝国主义的打算。即使这样，我知道绝大部分美国的战士，就像我们学校里的儿童一样，沉缅在理想中而不留心去看在这后面隐藏着什么。
    但是维护“海洋自由”的美国勇士如今在哪里呢？
    在中国沿海到处示威，犯着有史以来最可恶的侵犯公海自由的罪行！
    五年多以前爆发的朝鲜战争成为命令美国的第七舰队把台湾附近海面“中立化”的借口。从那以来，美国报刊曾竭力使公众相信：第七舰队只干这么一点事。
    我必须承认，直到我不久前访问了中国，我才充分晓得第七舰队在中国领海内的侵略行动的地理范围。第七舰队从南面的汕头直到北边的青岛一千浬的距离中到处巡逻。但是这些军舰并不是只干自己的事情的，它们支持由蒋介石指挥的“美制”舰只和飞机组成的海盗舰队。近几年来，蒋匪帮在第七舰队的纵容下，根据美国空军和情报部门所供给的情报，曾经扣留、拦截、袭击、掠夺或击沉了六百多艘商船。除了中国的船只之外，受害的还有英国、荷兰、挪威、丹麦、希腊、意大利、西德、巴拿马、波兰和苏联的船只。
    当我知道了这些事实，我禁不住这样想：假如中国或任何人也有一支舰队在从纽约到萨凡那的美国海岸上巡逻，保护着一支劫掠我们的船只的海盗舰队，美国人民会有什么感觉呢！
    虽然没有看到过在行动中的第七舰队，我却很高兴我没有看到过。我怕当美国的星条旗从身旁飘扬而过的时候，我会幻想到“海盗旗”的骷髅和两根交叉的骨头。我知道这是过激之言，但是在我旅行拉丁美洲、北非及其它地方的时候，我确曾看见美国的旗帜被用来掩护如此之多的帝国主义龌龊勾当，因此我对那些玷辱了我们的国旗的人实在忍耐不住了。而且我确信：全体美国人民绝不会同情那种力图扩张华尔街的帝国主义统治的军国主义图谋的。
    在北京，我参观过一个自然史的展览会，看到一幅很大的中国地理的挂图，图上镶有电钮，上面写着：金、银、铜、铁、煤、石油等字样。当讲解员连续按这些电钮的时候，在每一个已发现有某种矿藏的地方就闪现出带色的亮光，当所有的电钮都被按到了的时候，整个中国就像一个巨大的宝箱那样闪闪发亮。
    在我的脑海中也闪现出光来。
    我想：“这不是世界上唯一的一幅这样的地图。在华尔街，有一些人在他们的现代化的办公室的墙壁上也有这样的地图，而那些闪光已使他们疯狂到这样的地步，以致他们仍然在梦想着‘开放’中国和掠夺它的财富。这就是美国第七舰队所以在中国海面上游弋的道理！”
    当然，这些家伙从来也不会承认他们是有这种打算的。但是美国的法西斯伙帮的头目却比他们直率些。他们的任务是要使美国人民在种族、宗教和政治信念各方面对立起来。我有一次为了要揭发他们而参加了这种组织，我还记得蒙面三K党的一个州的头子杰·比·史东纳曾经对我说过的一番话。
    他宣称：“美国必须建立起一种力量，它必须强大到足以使我们可以向任何其他国家索取我们所要的东西，并且使他们全都得照我们的意旨办事！”
    三K党牧师阿·克·舒勒补充说：“麦克阿瑟将军坚持我们应该首先注意远东，这是完全正确的。世界的未来——财富正是在那里！”
    在我访问新中国的两个月当中，我所看到的已足够告诉任何可能怀有再次使中国“开放”供帝国主义压榨的想法的人：“那是办不到的！”
    在中国我还看到其他一些东西。在北京的宽敞的新侨饭店里，西方商人不顾杜勒斯的禁令，往来络绎不绝，他们的脸上带着笑容，口袋里放着利润优厚的合同。但是美国人却由于他们的不在那里而显得特别突出。
    如果美国的商业界清醒过来，就算是为了自身的利益也罢，它会看到它曾经丧失了一个多么美好的机会。中国的天然财富确是丰厚的；而她的六亿人民提供了一个无限的市场。社会主义的新中国，一心一意要提高人民的购买力，正在发展它的工业，并且正在系统地去发现和开发它的天然资源，确比封建的旧中国对美国的工业提供更美好的商业前途。
    当然，对美国来说，再没有比这更清楚的了：继续遵循目前的道路将会是既无效力而又有害的，它不是导致中国的孤立，而是美国的孤立。禁运在许多方面伤害着资本主义国家，为害之大甚于原来打算加诸社会主义国家的害处。例如，由于断绝了日本与中国的传统贸易，美国的工业不得不跟日本的工业竞争，而美国的纳税人就只好拿出许多美元来维持紊乱的日本经济。美国工业家们和普通的美国纳税人一样，可以从主张解除禁运而获得一切好处。美国人民，跟中国人民一样，期望日内瓦实现这一点。
    作为第一个被邀请踏入新中国的大门的独立的美国观察家，我可以报告说，敞开的听任帝国主义恣意掠夺的门户已经永远关闭起来了。我要坚决促使我的山姆大叔忘掉他可能怀有的打进去大肆掠夺的任何幻想。
    另一方面，如果美国商人能像他们过去所享有的精明名声的一半那样精明的话，他们将断然放弃干预他国的内政，忠守于以互利为基础的公平贸易的原则，撤回第七舰队，并且派出他们的货船。
    这样，进入新中国的门是敞开着的。
