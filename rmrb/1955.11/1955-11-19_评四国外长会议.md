The Foreign Ministers Conference of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, convened according to the instructions of the four heads of state, concluded on November 16. Although the four foreign ministers exchanged views extensively, which was not entirely without benefit, they failed to reach an agreement on the issues under discussion. The Four Foreign Ministers Conference clearly did not fulfill the mandate of the four heads of state, nor did it realize the expectations of the people of the world.

What are the reasons that the Foreign Ministers Conference failed to achieve its due success? There are different answers to this question.

At the last meeting of the Foreign Ministers Conference, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles hastily blamed the Soviet Union for the failure to reach an agreement in his speech. This is not in accordance with the facts. Dulles, who was called a “brilliant” player and the “most agile diplomat” by the American newspapers, showed joy and anger by turns during the three weeks of discussion, sometimes expressing disappointment and sometimes feigning optimism, all in order to blame the Soviet Union at the end of the meeting. However, Mr. Dulles's calculations were wrong, and it was Dulles himself who bungled things.

All peace-loving people around the world have their own views. They have drawn logically powerful conclusions from the entire course of the meeting.

As everyone knows, in order for the meeting to achieve positive results, each participant should faithfully follow the instructions given to the foreign ministers by the four heads of state. Because this instruction not only stipulated the issues for the foreign ministers to discuss, but also put forward the principles for solving these issues.

The four heads of state pointed out the close link between European security and the German question, and put European security first. The instructions also emphasized that the reunification of Germany must be in accordance with the national interests of the German people and the interests of European security. It was in this spirit that the Soviet Union proposed the establishment of a European collective security system and an all-German committee. If the Soviet proposals were implemented, it would not only effectively guarantee the security of European countries, but also create the necessary external and internal conditions for the reunification of Germany, and open up a realistic path to resolving the German question. However, the Western countries ignored the fact that the two sides were approaching consensus on the issue of European security and insisted on putting the German question ahead of European security. They wanted to make the issue of peace and security, which concerns the fate of hundreds of millions of people in Europe, dependent on their so-called all-German elections; and the purpose of this so-called all-German election was to establish a militarist system in eastern Germany as well, so as to drag the whole of Germany into the North Atlantic military bloc. This topsy-turvy and sinister approach has nothing in common with the instructions of the four heads of state.

The four heads of state instructed that the foreign ministers should have the participation of other relevant parties or consult with other relevant parties when discussing the German question. Needless to say, the most important "relevant parties" in the German question are the Germans themselves. However, the Western countries rejected the Soviet proposal to invite representatives from the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany to participate in the discussion.

One cannot fail to point out the fact that the two sides were already close to agreement on the issue of European security. The Soviet Union's various proposals concerning European security, especially the draft proposal on the first item on the agenda submitted on November 15, summarized the common points of the two sides to the greatest extent and were fully in line with the important principles concerning the European security treaty listed in the instructions of the four heads of state. Even so, the Western countries still refused to reach an agreement.

People remember that at the Disarmament Subcommittee meetings in March and April this year, the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France demanded that the Soviet Union agree to their proposals on limiting the levels of armed forces of major powers and implementing disarmament and banning atomic weapons in stages. The Soviet Union absorbed the views of the Western countries and put forward a proposal on disarmament on May 10. The Soviet draft on disarmament at the Foreign Ministers Conference was based on the May 10 proposal. Strangely, at this meeting, the Western countries no longer talked about their past proposals, and even avoided mentioning the necessity of banning atomic weapons.

On the issue of developing contacts between East and West, the Western countries refused to take any measures to lift the embargo that is currently seriously hindering East-West contacts, and instead put forward a series of demands aimed at interfering in the internal affairs of other countries. This made it impossible to reach an agreement on this agenda item.

All these facts show that the foreign ministers of the three Western countries abandoned the instructions of the heads of government of the four countries, and their position has retreated greatly compared with the period of the four heads of government conference. They set aside the points where the two sides had approached agreement on various issues, and put forward some proposals that they knew were unacceptable to the Soviet Union. Their purpose was obviously not to reach an agreement and solve the problem, but to cause the meeting to fail and shift the responsibility for the failure to the Soviet Union.

It is clear that some people in Western countries intend to change the path planned by the four heads of state in Geneva and re-intensify the "Cold War" and tense international situation. If one recalls the crusade "against the spirit of Geneva" launched by the American newspapers on the eve of the Foreign Ministers Conference, then one would not be surprised by the unserious political attitude shown by Dulles at the meeting. Early in the Foreign Ministers Conference, the American newspapers determined that the conference would not achieve results. Now, just as the Four Foreign Ministers Conference has ended, officials of the U.S. government are already anticipating that the results of the conference "will restore the old policy of strength to a primary position."

Every peace-loving person will never agree with the predictions of the "Cold War" advocates. Because the "spirit of Geneva" cannot be destroyed and strangled by a few politicians, just as it cannot be created by the subjective will of a few politicians. The emergence of the "spirit of Geneva" reflects the unprecedentedly broad development of the forces defending peace. Today, the strength of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries is growing rapidly; the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism composed of 900 million people is united like a rock. In many countries in Asia and Africa, the struggle for independence and freedom has made great progress. The calls for an end to the "Cold War" are getting louder and louder in Western European countries, and opposition to joining military blocs and stopping the arms race has become the common wish of the public in various countries. The idea that countries with different social systems can coexist peacefully has never been so deeply rooted in the hearts of the people as it is today; it has become a universally recognized principle that international disputes must be resolved through peaceful negotiation. It can be seen that the trend of easing the international situation is a definite and unswerving direction, which is difficult for anyone to stop. However, "the Tao is one foot high, and the devil is ten feet high." In the struggle for universal peace in the world, every step forward will inevitably encounter the obstruction and resistance of international reactionary forces. At the same time, every obstruction and resistance of the international reactionary forces will inevitably put them in an increasingly isolated position. Because of these resistances and obstructions, the Four Foreign Ministers Conference failed to reach an agreement, thereby making the international situation further eased, which is a fact. But what reason is there to be alarmed and think that the international situation is getting more tense? No. On the contrary, people can see clearly from the discussion process of the Four Foreign Ministers Conference: it is those forces that are afraid of the easing of the situation that are obstructing the conference from reaching an agreement, and it is also they who are trying to exaggerate the seriousness of the failure of the conference to reach an agreement to intensify the tense situation. There is a Chinese saying, "If you don't take it seriously, the monster will defeat itself." As long as the people of the world see clearly what tricks they are playing, this trick of deliberately creating tension will not achieve its purpose.

The struggle between peace forces and aggressive forces is a long-term and repeated struggle. In this struggle, the continuous growth and development of peace forces is an unchangeable law. Although the Four Foreign Ministers Conference did not reach an agreement on major international issues, as Molotov said, this conference "has drawn the attention of the general public to the most pressing issues of the moment, which will not fail to have a good influence." The people of all countries will heighten their vigilance, strengthen their unity, and continue to calmly carry out an unswerving struggle for further easing of the international situation.

### 评四国外长会议

　　评四国外长会议
    根据四国首脑的指示而召开的苏、美、英、法外长会议，已经在十一月十六日结束了。四国外长广泛地交换了意见，这虽然并非是完全无益的，但他们没有能够就讨论中的问题达成协议。四外长会议显然没有完成四国首脑的委托，也没有实现全世界人民对它的期望。
    是什么原因使得外长会议没有能够获得应有的成就？对于这个问题有着不同的回答。
    在外长会议最后一次会议上，美国国务卿杜勒斯在发言中急忙把没有取得协议的责任推给苏联。这是不符合事实的。被美国报纸称之为手法“玩得漂亮”和“最机敏的外交家”的杜勒斯，在三个星期的讨论中，忽喜忽怒，忽而表示失望，忽而故作乐观，就是为了可以在会议结束时归咎苏联。但是杜勒斯先生的算盘打错了，弄巧成拙的正是杜勒斯自己。
    全世界所有爱好和平的人士，有着自己的看法。他们从会议的整个进程中，得出了具有逻辑力量的结论。
    大家知道，要使会议获得积极的成果，每一个与会者都应该忠实地遵循四国首脑会议给外长们的指示。因为这个指示不仅规定了外长们讨论的问题，而且提出了解决这些问题的原则。
    四国首脑指出了欧洲安全和德国问题两者之间的密切联系，并把欧洲安全放在第一位。指示还强调，德国的重新统一，必须符合德国人民的民族利益和欧洲安全的利益。苏联正是根据这样的精神，提出了建立欧洲集体安全和全德委员会的建议。苏联的建议如果实现，不仅可以有效地保障欧洲国家的安全，并且为德国的重新统一创造了必要的外部条件和内部条件，开辟解决德国问题的现实途径。但是，西方国家却无视在欧洲安全问题上双方意见已趋接近的这一事实，硬是要把德国问题放在欧洲安全的前面。他们要把有关欧洲千百万人命运的和平和安全问题，取决于他们提出的所谓全德选举；而这个所谓全德选举的目的，则是要在德国的东部，也建立起军国主义制度，以便于把整个德国拉进北大西洋军事集团。这种本末倒置和包藏祸心的作法，和四国首脑的指示毫无共同之点。
    四国首脑指示，外长们在讨论德国问题时，应该有其他有关方面的参加，或同其他有关方面进行磋商。不用说，在德国问题上，最重要的“有关方面”，就是德国人自己。但是，西方国家却拒绝了苏联提出的邀请德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国代表参加讨论的建议。
    也不能不指出这样的事实：在欧洲安全问题上，双方的意见已经接近。苏联提出的有关欧洲安全的各项建议，特别是在十一月十五日提出的关于第一项议程的建议草案中，在最大的程度上概括了双方意见的共同点，并且完全吻合四国首脑指示中列举的关于欧洲安全条约的重要原则。即使这样，西方国家仍然拒绝达成协议。
    人们记得，在今年三月和四月间的裁军小组委员会上，美、英、法代表要求苏联同意他们关于限制大国武装部队的水平和分阶段实现裁军和禁止原子武器的建议。苏联吸收了西方国家的意见，在五月十日提出了关于裁军的建议。苏联在外长会议上的裁军草案，就是以五月十日的建议作基础的。奇怪的是，在这次会议上，西方国家已闭口不谈自己过去的建议，更回避提到禁止原子武器的必要性。
    对于发展东西方之间接触的问题，西方国家竟对取消目前严重阻碍着东西方接触的禁运，拒绝采取任何措施，反而提出一系列旨在干涉其他国家内政的要求。这就使得对于这一议程不可能达成协议。
    所有这些事实表明西方三国外长背弃了四国政府首脑的指示，他们的立场较之在四国政府首脑会议期间大大地后退了。他们撇开双方在各项问题上已经接近的各点，提出了一些明知为苏联所不能接受的建议，其目的显然不是为了达成协议、解决问题，而是为了使会议招致失败，并把失败的责任推到苏联的身上。
    很清楚，在西方国家中，有人打算改变四国首脑在日内瓦所规划的道路，重新加剧“冷战”和紧张国际局势。人们如果回忆到外长会议前夕由美国报纸发动的“反对日内瓦精神”的十字军运动，那末对于杜勒斯在会上所表现的不严肃的政治态度，就不会感到突然了。早在外长会议开始时，美国报纸就断定会议不会获得结果。现在，四外长会议刚刚结束，美国政府的官员已经在预料，会议的结果
  “将使旧有的实力政策恢复到首要地位”。
    每一个爱好和平的人士，决不会同意“冷战”鼓吹者的预言。因为“日内瓦精神”并不是少数几个政治家所可以摧毁和扼杀的，正如它并不是少数几个政治家能够凭借自己的主观意愿所可以创造的一样。“日内瓦精神”的产生，反映了保卫和平的力量有了空前广泛的发展。今天，苏联和各人民民主国家的力量，正在迅速增长；由九亿人口所组成的和平、民主和社会主义阵营，团结得像磐石一样。在亚洲和非洲的许多国家中，争取独立和自由的斗争，有了巨大的发展。西欧国家中要求结束“冷战”的呼声愈来愈高，反对参加军事集团、停止扩军备战已成为各国公众的共同愿望。不同社会制度的国家可以和平共处的思想，从来没有像今天这样深入人心；必须以和平协商的方式来解决国际纠纷，已成为获得普遍承认的原则。由此可见，国际局势的走向和缓，是个肯定不移的方向，这是任何人所难以阻挡的。但是，“道高一尺，魔高一丈”，在争取世界普遍和平的斗争中，每一步进展，都必然会遭遇到国际反动势力的阻挠和反抗。同时，国际反动势力的每一次阻挠和反抗也必然使他们自己陷于越来越孤立的地位。由于这些反抗和阻挠，四国外长会议没有能够达成协议，从而使国际局势获得进一步的缓和，这是事实。但是有什么理由可以大惊小怪，认为国际局势更加紧张了呢？没有。相反，人们从四国外长会议的讨论过程中可以了如观火地看出：正是那一些害怕局势缓和的势力在阻挠会议达成协议，同样是他们在企图夸大会议没有达成协议的严重性来加剧紧张局势。中国有句俗话，“见怪不怪，其怪自败”；只要世界人民看清楚了他们耍的是什么把戏，这种故意制造紧张的把戏也就达不到它的目的了。
    和平势力和侵略势力之间的斗争是一个长期的反复斗争。在这一斗争中，和平力量的不断壮大和发展，是一个无可改变的规律。四国外长会议虽然没有在重大的国际问题上达成协议，但正如莫洛托夫所说的，这个会议“引起了广大公众对当前最迫切问题的注意，这不会不产生良好的影响”。各国人民将提高警惕，加强团结，继续从容不迫地为争取国际局势的进一步和缓而进行坚持不渝的斗争。
