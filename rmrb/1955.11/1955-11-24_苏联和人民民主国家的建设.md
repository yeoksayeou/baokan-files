    The Construction of the Soviet Union and People's Democratic Countries
    The Great Development of Rural Electrification in the Soviet Union
    The Soviet countryside now has thousands of rural power stations with a total generating capacity of over 1.5 million kilowatts. They not only supply electricity to the rural areas of central Soviet Union, but also illuminate the remote rural areas of Central Asia, Siberia, the Baltic coast, the Far East, and the Arctic Circle. More than 90 percent of state farms, more than 21 percent of collective farms, and almost all machine tractor stations have been electrified. More than 100 agricultural regions and many states have been fully electrified or are close to being fully electrified. Electricity has become an indispensable part of production and life for the vast number of agricultural workers.
    The speed of rural electrification in the Soviet Union ranks first in the world. As early as 1940, the Soviet countryside had already built 700 hydroelectric power stations and many thermal power stations, and rural electricity consumption increased more than 350 times compared with 1913. During the post-war Five-Year Plan, the speed of electrification development was even faster, with hundreds or even thousands of new rural power stations starting to generate electricity every year. At present, the generating capacity of rural power stations across the country has increased seven times compared with 1940, and agricultural electricity consumption has increased approximately 3,000 times compared with 1913.
    Further Mechanization of the Soviet Coal Mining Industry
    In the first nine months of 1955, thousands of new types of machines were added to Soviet mines and open-pit coal mines, more than double the number in the same period last year. In the coal mines of Donbass, Kuzbass, Karaganda, Central Asia, Georgia, the Far East, and Vorkuta alone, there are currently nearly 1,300 coal mining combines in use. In the past four years, the amount of mechanized coal mining has increased by more than one and a half times.
    The new machines used in Soviet coal mines have largely implemented automatic and remote control. This not only reduces the labor of coal miners, but also saves a large number of workers, enabling them to engage in other work. Automated equipment has also been adopted in the water pumping systems in coal mines. As soon as water appears at the working face, the water pump will start automatically.
    In the fourth quarter of 1955, the factories under the "General Administration of Coal Mining Machine Manufacturing" of the Soviet Union also decided to increase the production of new machines such as coal loading machines, transport machines, elevators, etc.; their output will be 50 percent more than the output in the first six months of last year.
    Romania's Grain Output Reaches More Than 10 Million Tons
    Romania's grain production this year has reached 11 million tons. This figure is one million tons more than the original grain production plan for this year and two million tons more than the grain output in 1954, which was a good harvest year. Calculated on the basis of the country's approximately 17 million residents, each person can obtain nearly 1,300 jin of grain.
    This year, collective farms and joint cultivation societies have also further developed. From the end of last year to now, the number of collective farms and joint cultivation societies across the country has increased from nearly 5,000 to more than 5,700, and the cultivated land they and state farms possess has exceeded one-quarter of the country's cultivated land area. Collective farms that have embarked on the socialist road have shown great superiority in production. This year, their wheat and barley yield per hectare (equivalent to 15 mu) reached 2,000 to 3,000 kilograms, an average of 20 to 40 percent higher than individual farmers.
    Rapid Development of Hungarian Machine Manufacturing Industry
    The proportion of the machine manufacturing industry in Hungary in the entire manufacturing industry has now increased from about 16 percent before liberation to about 33 percent. In 1954, the last year of the first Five-Year Plan, Hungary's total industrial output increased by 1.3 times compared with 1949, while the output of the machine manufacturing industry increased by more than 2.6 times. Last year, Hungary's machine exports nearly increased to twelve times that before liberation, and the products of the machine manufacturing industry and the metallurgical industry accounted for half of the total exports. This fact powerfully illustrates the significant development of the Hungarian machine manufacturing industry, which is the heart of socialist industry.
    The production of Hungary's heavy machinery manufacturing industry has also developed rapidly. At present, it produces about 80 new types of machines. Products that could not be produced before the start of the first Five-Year Plan, such as mining equipment, buses, trucks, trolley buses, combine harvesters, and crawler tractors, can now be produced in large quantities. The output of ships, cranes, and railway vehicles has also increased significantly.

    苏联和人民民主国家的建设
    苏联农村电气化的巨大发展
    苏联农村现在已经有了总发电能力在一百五十万瓩以上的几千个农村电力站。它们不仅为苏联中部地区的农村供应电力，而且照亮了中亚细亚、西伯利亚、波罗的海沿岸、远东地区和北极圈内的偏僻的农村。全国百分之九十以上的国营农场、百分之二十一以上的集体农庄和几乎全部机器拖拉机站已经电气化，有一百多个农业区和许多州已经全面电气化或者接近全面电气化。电力已经成为广大的农业劳动者在生产和生活当中不可缺少的东西。
    苏联农村电气化的速度居世界第一位。还在一九四○年，苏联农村就已经建成了七百个水电站和许多火力发电站，农村对电力的消耗增为一九一三年的三百五十倍以上。在战后五年计划期间，电气化发展的速度更快了，每年都有几百个甚至成千个新的农村电力站开始发电。现在，全国农村电力站的发电能力已经增加为一九四○年的七倍，农业对电力的消耗约增为一九一三年的三千倍。
    苏联采煤工业进一步机械化
    在一九五五年头九个月中，苏联矿井和露天煤矿中又增添了数千部各种新式的机器，比去年同一时期增多了一倍以上。单是在顿巴斯、库兹巴斯、卡拉干达、中亚细亚、格鲁吉亚、远东和佛尔库塔的煤矿中使用的采煤联合机，目前就将近有一千三百部。在最近四年中，机械化的采煤数量增加了一倍半以上。
    苏联煤矿中采用的新式机器，在很大的规模上都实行了自动操纵和远距离操纵。这既可以减轻煤矿工人的劳动，又可以节省出大批工人，使他们从事其他工作。在煤矿中的抽水系统中，也采用了自动化的设备，只要工作面一出现水，抽水机就会自己开动起来。
    在一九五五年第四季度里，苏联“采煤机器制造总局”所属各工厂还决定增加装煤机、运输机、升降机等新式机器的生产；它们的产量将比去年头六个月的产量多百分之五十。
    罗谷物产量达到一千多万吨
    罗马尼亚今年的谷物生产量达到了一千一百万吨。这个数字比今年原定谷物生产计划多一百万吨，比收成良好的一九五四年谷物产量多两百万吨。按全国约一千七百万居民平均计算，每人可以得到将近一千三百市斤的谷物。
    今年，集体农庄和联合耕种社也进一步发展了。从去年年底到现在，全国的集体农庄和联合耕种社的数目从将近五千个增加到了五千七百多个，它们同国营农场所拥有的耕地面积已经超过了全国耕地面积的四分之一。走上了社会主义道路的集体农庄在生产中显示了巨大的优越性。今年它们每公顷（合十五市亩）的小麦和大麦的产量达到了两千到三千公斤，平均比个体农民高百分之二十到四十。
    匈机器制造业发展迅速
    匈牙利机器制造业在整个制造工业中的比重，现在已经由解放前的百分之十六增加到百分之三十三左右。在第一个五年计划的最后一年——一九五四年，匈牙利工业总产量比一九四九年增加了一点三倍，而机器制造业的产量就增加了二点六倍以上。去年，匈牙利输出的机器差不多已经增加到解放前的十二倍，机器制造业和冶金工业的产品已经占出口总额的一半。这一事实有力地说明了作为社会主义工业的心脏的匈牙利机器制造业的长足发展。
    匈牙利重型机器制造工业的生产也发展得很快。目前，它出产着约八十种新型机器。在第一个五年计划开始以前所不能生产的产品，如采矿设备、公共汽车、载重汽车、无轨电车、收割联合机、履带式拖拉机等，现在已经能够大批生产。船只、起重机、铁路车辆的产量也大大增加了。
