    A Good Example of Developing Local Opera
    —— Impressions of the Shandong Lü剧 Troupe's Performance in Beijing
    Wu Xue
    Lü剧 is one of the local opera genres in Shandong Province. It evolved from the folk storytelling form of "Zuoqiang Yangqin" and is popular in the rural areas of Shandong. There are very few professional Lü剧 performers. Most are amateur farmers who love opera and form amateur troupes to perform during the Spring Festival or temple fairs. Before liberation, there was only one professional troupe with about twenty people. In the past, farmers called it "Yangqin Opera." Because its language is easy to understand and its descriptions of life are detailed and captivating, farmers also called it "Mí Opera" (enthralling opera). Now, it is commonly known as "Lü剧." The name is said to have two origins: one says that because the props for the opera could be carried by a single donkey, farmers would call it "Donkey Opera." Later, it was felt that the character "驴" (donkey) was not good to write, so it was changed to "Lü剧." Another explanation is that the main instrument in this type of opera is the zhuìqín (a kind of bowed string instrument), which is played up and down, so farmers called it "Lǚ Opera" (thread opera), and those who recorded the words wrote it as "Lü剧." Regardless of which explanation is correct, it shows that it is a local opera that the masses love to see and hear.
    In 1950, the Shandong Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles decided to send a group of new art workers to reform Lü剧 because of its beautiful music, lively form, and ease of expressing modern life. Over the past five years, under the leadership of the Party, these art workers have continuously waged ideological struggles against those who held conservative or dismissive attitudes towards national heritage. They persevered in learning from veteran artists, from traditional art, and from life. They reorganized more than ten traditional Lü剧 and other opera repertoires, such as "Wang Dingbao's Pawn," "Borrowing the New Year," "Drinking Noodle Soup," "Striking the Golden Bough," and "Liu Hai Chopping Wood." They learned the postures and dances of Peking Opera and Kunqu Opera, and the staging methods of spoken drama. Some of them also read Stanislavski's books on acting.
    On this basis, they successfully created the new opera "Sister-in-Law Li's Remarriage," which reflects the peasant's marriage struggles and expresses rural life. This opera won the first prize for script, excellent performance award, director award, and music reform award at the East China Opera Festival. Its performance in Beijing this time has been warmly welcomed by the audience and has aroused great attention in the literary and art circles, who believe that this is a new achievement in the development of local opera under Chairman Mao's policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new." Its simple style, realistic sense of life, harmony of music, singing, and movements, and the complete unity of the stage image, especially the creation of the two new characters, Sister-in-Law Li and Aunt Zhang, represent a great step forward compared with some previous new opera repertoires that depicted modern life.
    Their successful example illustrates the following issues:
    First, it is of great significance not only for the transformation of new art workers with a certain level of cultural and artistic attainment and political awareness to participate in the reform of local opera, but also for the development of China's opera undertaking.
    The Shandong Lü剧 Troupe is composed of new art workers transferred from eight cultural troupes, without a single veteran artist. Initially, they looked down on national heritage and blindly worshipped Western things. They mistakenly believed that there was no future in Lü剧 and that their careers were over! They were not at ease with their work and did not want to wear their badges. When writing letters to friends, they dared not tell their address and what work they were doing, only saying that they were doing art work, thinking that engaging in local opera was their own lack of promise. After the Party rectification, although they obeyed the organization's arrangements, their ideological problems were not resolved.
    It was not until the troupe performed "Sister-in-Law Li's Remarriage" in Huimin that everyone's thinking truly changed. Some widows regarded them as the government's marriage work team, and after the show, they lingered near their residence until late at night, reluctant to leave. Sometimes during the show, they could hear various discussions in the audience. Once, a little girl asked an old woman while watching the show: "Mother, what do you think should be done about my sister-in-law's matter?" The old woman took a breath and said, "Alas, the new society is good!" When they returned to Jinan for a public performance, the original decision was to perform for only ten days, but due to the enthusiastic demands of the masses, it was extended to more than fifty days. Audiences lined up in four queues to buy tickets, and some people went back and forth several times without being able to buy a ticket. At that time, Jinan was truly a city of street talk and discussions, a grand occasion. The masses believed that their opera was better than the Lü Opera that had not been reformed. Some farmers came from dozens of miles away, bringing peanuts to sell and buy tickets, just to see a performance. All these things moved them, and coupled with the in-depth study of the central government's policy instructions on opera reform, their thinking was completely cleared up, and they hung out their badges.
    These comrades mostly have a certain level of cultivation and no old habits. As long as the ideological problem is solved, they can quickly master traditional skills. For example, when they were learning the Kunqu Opera "Thinking of the World," they adopted scientific staging methods such as analyzing characters and transcribing music, and learned in fifteen days what veteran artists used to take half a year to learn. It is even more convenient to accept new things. Because new life and new characters are also easier for them to approach. Therefore, when they perform traditional repertoires, people think they are veteran artists, and when they perform modern repertoires, people think they are performing new opera. When they participated in the East China Opera Festival and received awards, they realized that the masses had cultivated them.
    Second, to create national new opera, it is necessary to respect national traditions, start from the content, use traditional artistic skills to reflect life and portray characters, and carry out reforms on the basis of local opera. Our new opera is forming, "The White-Haired Girl," "Liu Hulan," and "Song of the Prairie" are new operas, and "Sister-in-Law Li's Remarriage," which has developed on the basis of local opera, should also be said to be new opera. Regardless of which path, it is necessary to learn from national traditions and inherit heritage. In the past, the Lü剧 Troupe also had doubts, wavered, and even took detours on the issue of Lü剧's development. In the early stages, after learning from veteran artists and just touching a little bit of Lü剧's fur, some people had the conservative idea that "Lü剧 is Lü剧, and it cannot be moved at all, it is not Lü剧 if it is moved"; after studying and observing many fraternal opera genres, there was another idea of wanting to abandon tradition and create some Shandong representative opera genre "Lu Opera" out of thin air. This is a rude attitude. Whether it is conservative thinking or a rude attitude, it is a formalism that separates tradition and will not work. Finally, they were determined to reorganize and reform on the basis of Lü剧, starting from the content, and in this way, they created a repertoire like "Sister-in-Law Li's Remarriage." In order to achieve the goal of more deeply reflecting the reality of life and portraying the characters' personalities, they also absorbed, dissolved, improved, and created various excellent skills from other folk arts. The success of "Sister-in-Law Li's Remarriage" proves that this approach is correct. "Sister-in-Law Li's Remarriage" has not only been approved by the masses, but also by veteran Lü剧 artists. However, in terms of the depth and breadth of the issues reflected, we can see that it has greatly developed the original Lü剧 (it may not be enough to preserve and develop Lü剧 music in some issues, especially in music). This has in fact shattered the fallacy that folk forms are simple and cannot express the complex social life and character of modern society.
    Third, going deep into life, studying life, and maintaining close ties with the masses are the main sources of improving artistic creation.
    In opera troupes, it is not common for a troupe like the Lü剧 Troupe to raise the issue of studying life so highly. The Lü剧 Troupe not only maintained close ties with the masses during performances, but also relied on the masses during the creation process. For example, Lang Xianfen, the actress who plays Sister-in-Law Li, is a twenty-two-year-old young woman. In order to get a correct sense of self as a widow, she contacted more than a dozen widows in the countryside and also made friends with a widow who had a similar experience to Sister-in-Law Li. Wang Junying, who plays Aunt Zhang, is a twenty-five-year-old young woman who has also talked with more than a dozen old ladies, observed their lives, and experienced their thoughts and feelings of love for the new society, so that she created a typical Shandong old lady image.
    During performances in the countryside, they also organized audience representative forums to listen to the opinions of the masses and constantly improve their creations. For example, once the audience made such comments on the scene where Sister-in-Law Li went to Aunt Zhang's house to inquire about Zhang Xiaoliu's attitude towards her: "Why are your actors always looking at the sky? Is there an airplane in the sky? Since Sister-in-Law Li loves Zhang Xiaoliu, why doesn't she find something to do and fan him when it's so hot?" These sharp and humorous comments gave the actors a good suggestion. Due to this suggestion, the director added a scene here where Sister-in-Law Li first poured a bowl of water for Zhang Xiaoliu to drink, picked up the fan and fanned herself, then slowly turned around and fanned Zhang Xiaoliu while talking, and finally handled it into a very realistic and very poetic scene.
    This is the fundamental reason why their performances can maintain such a strong atmosphere of life and the smell of earth, and can create such simple and realistic character images.
    The Shandong Lü剧 Troupe has provided valuable experience in the reform of opera and how to develop new opera on the basis of local opera. It is hoped that the Lü剧 Troupe will maintain this excellent style and creative spirit in the future and add more and richer flowers to the garden of our motherland's opera art.

    发展地方戏曲的好榜样
    ——山东省吕剧团在北京的演出观后感
    吴雪
    吕剧是山东省地方剧种之一，由民间说唱形式“坐腔洋琴”演化而来，在山东农村流行。吕剧的专业艺人很少，大多由爱好戏曲的农民，凑成个子弟班，在春节或庙会上唱，解放前只有唯一的一个二十多人的职业剧团。过去，农民叫它“洋琴戏”。又因为它语言通俗，描写生活细致，听来使人入迷，农民又叫它“迷戏”。现在通称“吕剧”。这名词据说有两个来源：一说是因演戏的东西，只用一头驴子一驮就来了，以后他们每到一处，农民就叫“驴戏”来了。后来觉得“驴”字写来不好，就改成“吕戏”的。又一说是因为这种戏里的主要乐器是坠琴，拉时缕上缕下，农民就叫它“缕戏”，文字记录的人把它记成“吕戏”了。不管那种说法，反正说明它是一种群众喜闻乐见的地方戏曲。
    一九五○年，山东省文学艺术界联合会因为吕剧音乐优美，形式活泼，又便于表现现代生活，就决定抽一批新文艺工作者去从事吕剧的改革工作。五年来，在党的领导下，这些文艺工作者不断地同那些对待民族遗产持有保守态度和轻视态度的人，展开了思想斗争。坚持向老艺人，向传统艺术，向生活进行了艰苦的学习。整理了吕剧及其他剧种如“王定保借当”“借年”“喝面叶”“打金枝”“刘海砍樵”等十多个传统剧目，学习了京戏昆曲的身段和舞蹈，学习了话剧的排演方法，他们中间个别的人也阅读斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基表演体系的书籍。
    在这个基础上，他们才成功地创造了反映农民婚姻斗争，表现农村生活的新歌剧“李二嫂改嫁”。这个戏在华东戏曲会演中曾获剧本一等奖、优秀演出奖、导演奖、音乐改革奖。这次在北京演出，受到观众热烈的欢迎，引起了文艺界极大的重视，认为这是在毛主席“百花齐放，推陈出新”的方针下、地方戏曲发展上的一个新收获。它那朴素的风格，真实的生活感，音乐、唱腔和动作的和谐，舞台形象的完整统一，特别是李二嫂张大娘这两个新人物形象的创造，比起过去某些戏曲表现现代生活的新剧目，又大大跨进了一步。
    通过他们成功的例子，向我们说明了这样一些问题：
    第一，具有一定文化艺术水平和政治修养的新文艺工作者，参加地方戏剧改革工作，不仅对自己是一个很好的改造，对我国戏曲事业的发展，也是有重大意义的。
    山东省吕剧团是由八个文工团中抽调出来的新文艺工作者组成的，其中没有一个老艺人。最初他们看不起民族遗产和盲目崇拜西洋的错误思想，以为搞吕剧没有什么发展，自己的前途完了！工作不安心，把证章揣在兜里不愿挂在胸前。给朋友写信，不敢告诉自己的地址和在做什么工作，只说做文艺工作，认为搞地方小戏是自己的没出息。整党以后，虽然服从组织分配，思想上并没有解决问题。
    一直到剧团在惠民演出“李二嫂改嫁”一剧以后，大家的思想才真正有所转变。有的寡妇把他们当成政府的婚姻工作队，戏散后，在他们住地徘徊到深夜不忍离去。有时在台下，当场就听到各种议论，有一次一个小姑娘在看戏中间问一个老太太说：“娘，你看我嫂子那事该怎么样办？”老太太吸了一口气说：“唉，还是新社会好啊！”当他们回到济南举行公演，原来决定只公演十天的，由于群众的热烈要求，一直增加到五十多天。观众排成四队买票，有往返几次买不到票的。当时济南城里，真是街谈巷议，盛况空前，群众认为他们的戏，比没经过改革的吕戏好看。有的农民从几十里以外，带着花生跑来，卖了花生买票，就为看一场戏。这许多事情，都叫他们感动，再加上这时深入地学习了中央关于戏曲改革的方针指示，这以后思想才算完全通了，证章也挂出来了。
    这些同志，大都具有一定的修养，没有旧的习气，只要思想问题一解决，就能很快地掌握传统的技巧，如他们在学昆曲“思凡”的时候，采用了分析人物、记谱子等科学排演方法，十五天就学得了从前老艺人要半年才学会的东西。在接受新的东西上，就更方便。因为新的生活、新的人物，他们也比较容易接近。所以在他们演传统剧目的时候，人们都以为他们是老艺人，在演现代剧目的时候，人们又当他们在演新歌剧。当参加华东戏曲会演得到奖励的时候，他们才意识到群众已经把他们培养出来了。
    第二，创造民族的新歌剧，必须尊重民族传统，从内容出发，运用传统的艺术技巧来反映生活，刻划人物，在地方戏的基础上进行。我们的新歌剧正在形成，“白毛女”“刘胡兰”“草原之歌”是新歌剧，从地方戏曲的基础上发展起来的“李二嫂改嫁”，应该说也是新歌剧。不管哪条道路，都需要向民族传统学习，继承遗产。过去，吕剧团对吕剧的发展问题，也是有过怀疑、动摇，甚至走过弯路的。在初期经过向老艺人学习，刚刚摸到一点吕剧的皮毛的时候，有一部分人曾产生过“吕剧就是吕剧，一点也动不得，动了就不是吕剧了”的保守思想；在研究、观摩了许多兄弟剧种之后，又有一种想丢掉传统，架空地创造什么山东代表剧种“鲁剧”的想法。这是一种粗暴态度。不管是保守思想也好，粗暴态度也好，都是一种割裂传统，形式主义的做法，行不通的。最后，他们下决心在吕剧的基础上，从内容出发进行整理和改革工作，这样就创作出了“李二嫂改嫁”这样的剧目。为了达到更深刻的反映生活真实，刻划人物性格的目的，他们还同时吸收其他民间艺术的各种优良技巧，加以溶化，改进，创造。“李二嫂改嫁”的获得成功，就证明这样的做法是正确的。“李二嫂改嫁”不仅经过群众批准，也经过吕剧老艺人批准。但在反映问题的深度和广度上讲，我们能看出它已经较大地发展原来的吕剧了（可能在某些问题特别是在音乐上要保存和发展吕剧音乐上还不够）。这就在事实上粉碎了那些认为民间形式简单，不能表现现代复杂的社会生活和人物性格的谬论。
    第三，深入生活，研究生活，同群众保持密切联系，是提高艺术创作的主要泉源。
    在戏曲团体中，像吕剧团把研究生活的问题，提得这样高，还是不多的。吕剧团不仅在演出时，同群众保持了密切的联系，就是在创作过程中，也是依靠群众的。如扮演李二嫂的演员朗咸芬，是一个二十二岁的青年，她为了要获得一个寡妇的正确的自我感觉，曾在乡村接触过十几个寡妇，还同一个同李二嫂遭遇相似的寡妇交上了朋友。扮演张大娘的王俊英，是一个二十五岁的青年，也同十多个老太太谈过心，观察她们的生活，体验她们热爱新社会的思想感情，这样才创造了一个典型的山东老太太的形象。
    在农村演出中，他们还组织观众代表座谈会，倾听群众的意见，不断改进自己的创造。如有一次观众对李二嫂到张大娘家去探听张小六对自己的态度那一场戏，提了这样的意见：“你们的演员为什么老望着天上，天上有飞机么？李二嫂既然爱张小六，为什么不找点事做，天那么热，给他打个扇不好吗？”这些尖锐而幽默的意见，给演员们提示了很好的动作。由于这个提示，导演在这里加上了李二嫂先为张小六倒了一碗水喝着，顺手拿起扇子来自己扇着，再慢慢的转过去一边为张小六打扇，一边说话，终于处理成非常真实又非常有诗意的一场戏。
    这就是他们的演出能保持那样浓烈生活气息和泥土气息，能创造出那样朴素真实的人物形象的根本原因。
    山东省吕剧团对戏剧改革工作，及如何在地方戏的基础上发展新歌剧的问题，都提供了可贵的经验。希望吕剧团今后保持这种优良的作风和创造精神，为我们祖国的戏曲艺术园地增添更多更丰富的花朵。
