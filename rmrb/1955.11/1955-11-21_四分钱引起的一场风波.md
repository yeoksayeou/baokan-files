　　A Quarrel Caused by Four Cents
　　Editor:
　　On the evening of July 3rd, Wang Ruiyu, deputy director of the Public Security Bureau of the Jiaozhou Prefectural Office in Shandong Province, mistakenly bought a military preferential ticket at the staff movie theater in Jiaoxian County. When he was about to enter, the ticket inspector discovered that he was not a member of the People's Liberation Army and asked him to pay an additional four cents to make up the difference in the regular ticket price.

　　Deputy Director Wang, seeing so many spectators around him watching, felt that it would be a loss of "face" to pay the extra four cents, so he used the excuse of "Why did you sell me a military preferential ticket?" and insisted on entering. The ticket inspector patiently explained to him, "If the movie theater sold the wrong ticket, it's the movie theater's fault; but the system of preferential treatment for soldiers should be observed by all spectators." Because of this argument, many spectators who were unable to buy tickets or enter the theater due to the crowding criticized his refusal to pay the additional fare, which disrupted the order of the movie theater. At this time, a comrade who had come to see the movie with Deputy Director Wang paid the four cents to the ticket inspector on his behalf.

　　Originally, this disturbance should have subsided. However, Deputy Director Wang refused to lose this argument. He suddenly snatched the four cents back from the ticket inspector, while scolding the movie theater for "extorting money." Then, he stormed into the ticket booth and dragged out the ticket seller who was working, forcing him to explain to the audience why he had sold the military preferential ticket by mistake. The ticket seller explained that the ticket window was small, and at the time, he saw the person buying the ticket wearing a military uniform and did not clearly distinguish whether he was a soldier. But this was not enough to prove that Deputy Director Wang had any reason to refuse to pay the additional fare. Seeing that the audience still did not sympathize with him, Deputy Director Wang stormed into the movie theater office and called Zhao, the section chief of the Cultural and Educational Section, the movie theater's superior authority, to handle the incident. Unfortunately, the call did not go through. At this time, all three managers of the movie theater came out and repeatedly apologized to the "leader," asking him to calm down and go in to watch the movie. However, the three to four hundred spectators present were even more indignant. At this point, Deputy Director Wang glared angrily at the surrounding audience as if to demonstrate, shouting, "I'm not watching, I wasn't planning to watch a movie tonight anyway!" and swaggered away.

　　Wang Ruiyu's behavior aroused dissatisfaction among the masses. That night, many cadres and workers reported his mistake to the Jiaozhou Prefectural Party Committee, and the responsible comrades of the Prefectural Party Committee criticized him. But until now, Wang Ruiyu still refuses to examine his mistakes. He once said confidently to the head of the Cadre Section of the Prefectural Party Committee: "These are details of life, don't make a fuss about them." Indeed, it was a small matter that the movie theater sold the wrong ticket and requested additional payment after discovering the mistake; but Deputy Director Wang, in order to maintain his "dignity," acted unreasonably for about an hour, disrupting the order of the public entertainment venue, delaying many spectators from watching the movie, and causing a bad political impact. This small matter has been magnified by Deputy Director Wang himself. What reason does Deputy Director Wang have to evade criticism and refuse to examine himself?

### 四分钱引起的一场风波

　　四分钱引起的一场风波编辑同志：
    七月三日晚上，山东省胶州专署公安处副处长王瑞玉在胶县城内的职工影剧院错买了一张军人优待票。当他要入场的时候，检票员发现他并不是人民解放军，就请他按普通票价再补票款四分。
    王副处长一看四周这末多的观众都瞅着他，感到如果补付四分票款未免有失“面子”，就用“你们为什么卖军人优待票给我？”作理由，坚持要这样进去。检票员耐心地向他解释：如果卖错了票，是影剧院不对；可是优待军人的制度，观众应该共同遵守。”由于发生了这场争吵，一时被挤得买不上票和入不了场的观众们纷纷对他这种拒不补票以致影响影剧院秩序的行为提出批评。这时，同王副处长一起来看电影的一位同志就代为拿出四分钱交给了检票员。
    本来这场风波应该平息了。但是王副处长却不肯输这口气，他一面猛然从检票员手里夺回了这四分钱，一面大骂影剧院“讹人”。接着，他又气势汹汹地闯进了票房，把正在工作着的售票员硬拖出来，逼他向观众说明为什么错卖军人优待票。售票员说明了售票窗口小，当时看见身穿军人上衣的买票人就没有辨清是否军人。但是这并不足以证明王副处长有任何理由拒绝补票。王副处长一见观众仍然不同情他，又闯进影剧院办公室，打电话找影剧院的主管上级文教科的赵科长来处理这个事件。不幸，电话没有接通。这时，影剧院三位经理全都走了出来，向“首长”再三检讨，请他赶快息怒，进去看电影。可是，在场的三、四百名观众们更为不平了。这时，王副处长又气冲冲地向四周的观众怒目横扫一遍，像是示威似地嚷道：“不看，不看，本来今晚上我也没准备看电影！”大摇大摆地走了。
    王瑞玉这种行为引起了群众的不满，当晚就有不少机关干部和工人向中共胶州地委揭发他的错误，地委有关负责同志对他提出了批评。但是直到现在，王瑞玉还是拒绝检查自己的错误，他曾经理直气壮地向地委干部科长说：“这是生活细节，不能小题大作。”的确，影剧院卖错了票，而在发觉以后要求补交票款，本来是一件小事；但是王副处长为了维护自己的“尊严”，就无理取闹了一个小时左右，扰乱了公共娱乐场所的秩序，使很多观众耽误了看电影，以致造成了恶劣的政治影响。这件小事已经被王副处长自己弄大了。王副处长有什么理由来逃避批评和拒绝检讨呢？
