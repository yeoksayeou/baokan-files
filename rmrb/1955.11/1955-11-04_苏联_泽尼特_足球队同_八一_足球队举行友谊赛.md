Xinhua News Agency, November 3rd: The Soviet Leningrad "Zenit" Voluntary Sports Association football team played a brilliant friendly match with the Chinese People's Liberation Army "August 1st" football team at the Beijing Xian Nong Tan Stadium on the afternoon of the 3rd.

Premier of the State Council Zhou Enlai and many heads of government departments watched today's game.

The "August 1st" team launched a quick attack after the kickoff. The "Zenit" team subsequently also launched an offensive. Due to the "August 1st" team's defenders actively intercepting, goalkeeper Huang Zhaowen did not receive a ball shot by the "Zenit" team's forward until the eighth minute. After that, the "August 1st" team organized several attacks in succession, but the forwards' shots were weak, and several shots were caught by "Zenit" team goalkeeper L. Ivanov.

The "Zenit" team's offense gradually increased. At twenty-seven minutes, a thrilling save occurred in front of the "August 1st" team's goal: the "Zenit" team's "corner kick" landed in front of the "August 1st" team's goal, and the "Zenit" team forward shot fiercely. The "August 1st" team's goalkeeper pushed the ball away from the goal not far. The "Zenit" team forward caught up and shot again. Seeing that the ball was about to enter the empty goal, the "August 1st" team center-back Zhou Xing quickly filled the position and hooked the ball out. At thirty-four minutes, a melee broke out again in front of the "August 1st" team's goal. The "Zenit" team forward shot from very close to the goal. The "August 1st" team's goalkeeper Ye Men failed to catch the ball while trying to save it. The "Zenit" team center forward P. Katrovsky stepped forward and kicked the ball into the net. At forty minutes, "Zenit" team center forward P. Katrovsky headed a high ball passed from the left rear into the "August 1st" team's goal. After losing two goals in a row, the "August 1st" team's offensive became more intense, but they failed to score under the opponent's strong interception.

The second half of the game was very intense, and tense scenes occurred in front of both goals, but at the end of the game, the score remained at two to zero. The "Zenit" team won.

Xinhua News Agency, November 3rd: The Soviet Leningrad "Zenit" Voluntary Sports Association football team, which was invited to visit China, left Beijing by train on the evening of the 3rd to visit Shanghai. During its stay in Beijing, the "Zenit" football team not only played three games but also visited and toured. The football team's head coach N.M. Lyukhinov and others also held symposiums with Chinese sports workers and athletes to exchange experiences in football.

    苏联“泽尼特”足球队同“八一”足球队举行友谊赛
    据新华社三日讯　苏联列宁格勒“泽尼特”志愿体育协会足球队三日下午在北京市先农坛体育场同中国人民解放军“八一”足球队举行了一场精采的友谊比赛。
    国务院总理周恩来和政府部门的许多首长观看了今天的球赛。
    “八一”队在开球后首先展开快攻。“泽尼特”队随后也发动攻势。由于“八一”队后卫积极地拦截，守门员黄肇文到第八分钟时才第一次接到“泽尼特”队前锋射来的球。此后，“八一”队接连组织了几次进攻，但前锋射门的力量小，几次射出的球都被“泽尼特”队守门员列·伊凡诺夫接住。
    “泽尼特”队的进攻渐渐多了起来。二十七分钟时，在“八一”队门前出现了一个惊险的救球场面：“泽尼特”队发的“角球”落在“八一”队门前，“泽尼特”队前锋猛射一脚，“八一”队守门员离门将球托出不远，“泽尼特”队前锋赶上再射，眼看球就要进入空门，这时“八一”队中卫周兴迅速补位，倒钩一脚将球救出。三十四分钟时，在“八一”队门前又演成混战，“泽尼特”队前锋在离门很近的地方射门，“八一”队守门员叶门抢救没有把球扑住，“泽尼特”队中锋彼·卡特罗夫斯基上前一脚，将球踢入网内。四十分钟时，“泽尼特”队中锋彼·卡特罗夫斯基把由左后方传来的高球顶入“八一”队球门。“八一”队连失两球后攻势转猛，但在对方强力拦截下没能得分。
    下半场球赛进行得很激烈，双方球门前都出现过紧张场面，但到终场时，记分牌上仍挂着二比零的数字。“泽尼特”队获胜。
    据新华社三日讯　应邀来中国访问的苏联列宁格勒“泽尼特”志愿体育协会足球队，三日晚乘火车离北京去上海访问。“泽尼特”足球队在北京期间，除作了三场比赛外，还进行了参观和游览。足球队的总教练纳·麦·柳克欣诺夫等人还同中国的体育工作者和运动员们举行座谈会，交流了足球运动方面的经验。
