In his report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation," Comrade Mao Zedong instructed Party committees at all levels to closely monitor the agricultural cooperation movement and to "solve problems as soon as they arise, rather than allowing them to accumulate before attempting a general solution." Currently, many regions' Party committees are following Comrade Mao Zedong's instruction, immediately conducting thorough inspections as the mass movement surges forward. In Yancheng Prefecture, Jiangsu Province, a mass upsurge in establishing cooperatives has already begun. After conducting inspections, the Yancheng Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued instructions to county and district committees, stating that "leading cadres of all county and district committees should personally delve into one township and one cooperative, while also urging general district and township cadres to conduct inspections and fact-finding work"; "a comprehensive inspection should be conducted for each new cooperative that has been established, is being established, or is about to be established." This is absolutely necessary. Only in this way can the Party's leadership keep pace with the development of the movement and firmly maintain control of the movement's leadership.

The focus of the Party committee's inspection of the cooperative movement should currently be on examining the transmission and implementation of the Party's policies on agricultural cooperation in various localities.

Correctly conveying Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions and the resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) to all rural Party members and cadres is the first step in correctly implementing the Party's cooperation policy. According to a report from the Hebei Provincial Party Committee, the Gaocheng County Party Committee has done a relatively good job in this regard. The County Party Committee first strictly selected one hundred and seven cadres from among the section and bureau-level cadres of the county and districts who were capable of performing this task. They were given short-term training to ensure they had a relatively deep and comprehensive understanding of the spirit of Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions and the resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged). Before the communication, they also made specific preparations for the speech, especially studying how to communicate in connection with reality; what to connect with and how to connect were thought out in advance. As a result, the communication was easily understood by rural Party members, preventing the phenomenon of speaking off the cuff and making irrelevant connections. After the communication, the Party members were led in planned and organized discussions, and attention was also paid to answering their questions. However, few places have done as well as the Gaocheng County Party Committee. Some places even simply read the documents and ended the communication hastily. Party committees at all levels should learn from Gaocheng County's spirit of conscientious communication, refer to its experience of "thorough preparation, connection with reality, and earnest discussion," and do a good job of communication based on the actual conditions of their own regions.

After studying Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions and the resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged), Party committees at all levels should immediately mobilize their members and cadres to conduct widespread publicity among the masses. According to a report from the Fujian Provincial Party Committee, the better-performing areas first held Party member meetings and enlarged cadre meetings. After Party members and cadres had a relatively clear and comprehensive understanding, they mobilized Party members, cadres, and activists to conduct extensive and in-depth publicity among the masses. The publicity should be comprehensive and thorough; and attention should be paid to combining it with reality, giving many local examples. This publicity work should be carried out vigorously so that all men and women, young and old, understand the principles, policies, and specific methods. However, in many places, the publicity is not comprehensive. For example, some only talk about relying on poor peasants but do not talk about uniting with middle peasants. Some places do not explain it thoroughly. For example, they only say that lower-middle peasants are also a reliable force, but they cannot explain the reasons or the policy toward upper-middle peasants. Some places are still doing individual publicity on a small scale; others are satisfied with holding large meetings and do not conduct in-depth and specific individual publicity.

In the communication and publicity of the Party's policies, Party committees in all localities should conduct timely and in-depth inspections of these good and bad situations, promptly summarize and promote good experiences, and promptly change bad practices. In places where the work is not done well, make up the lessons so that the Party's guidelines and policies for cooperation are truly grasped by Party members, cadres, and the broad masses and truly become a weapon for promoting the movement.

Cadres and the masses need to constantly study policies and be constantly trained in practice to correctly grasp policies. The responsibility of Party leading organs and leading cadres should be to correctly lead cadres to implement the Party's policies while correctly communicating and publicizing them, and to regularly check their implementation, solving problems as soon as they arise. According to reports from several provincial Party committees, the cooperative movement in various localities is progressing rapidly and is basically very healthy. The facts fully prove that cadres and the masses are capable of running many cooperatives and running them well, and are able to act in accordance with the Party's policies. However, the scale of the cooperative movement is so large that some shortcomings and deviations are unavoidable in the movement. Even in a cooperative, township, or district where the work is done very well, there are bound to be shortcomings. This precisely illustrates the importance of timely inspection. Only by promptly identifying problems through inspection can leading organs fully understand the development of the movement and solve problems in a timely manner.

Leading Party personnel at all levels should personally go down to inspect work, personally see how the work of the lower levels is done, help lower-level personnel analyze the causes of shortcomings and errors, find ways to correct them, and help them improve their abilities in practical work. The purpose of inspection work is not only to discover and correct shortcomings but also to prevent the occurrence of shortcomings and errors. Leading comrades should have foresight and be good at seeing major problems in the embryonic stage in the process of going deep into reality, reminding lower-level personnel in a timely manner, and helping lower-level personnel think of ways to navigate around hidden reefs. When a mistake in principle, even if it is just emerging, should be criticized in a timely manner to help them correct it in time, and should not always be fond of post-facto criticism. For example, there is now a phenomenon of forcing peasants to join cooperatives in some places. Although it is individual and not serious, it should be criticized and helped to correct it in time. Do not wait until the problem becomes serious before specifically opposing coercion and commandism.

Of course, shortcomings and errors must be analyzed. Are they dominant or non-dominant in the work? Are they universal or individual? Are they major or minor? Are they principled or non-principled? Are they caused by objective reasons or subjective reasons? These must be studied clearly and correct judgments must be made. Do not be alarmed when shortcomings and errors are discovered, do not blame the lower levels, and do not pour cold water on the masses. If the error is already being corrected, lower-level personnel should not be blamed again, but should be encouraged to correct the error, helping them to understand the error more deeply and to come up with ways to correct it quickly. If some shortcomings, although they are relatively important shortcomings, cannot be overcome immediately under the current conditions, cadres should be helped to prepare the conditions for overcoming the shortcomings, or they should be helped to make a plan to first grasp the key points and gradually overcome them; they cannot be forced to do it immediately, and it cannot be hoped that cadres will overcome all shortcomings in a very short time. If some shortcomings are very minor, they can be reminded to pay attention at an appropriate time, without distracting them from focusing all their efforts on solving the most important, fundamental, and critical problems at hand.

Comrade Mao Zedong taught the Party's leading personnel to share the destiny and breathe the same air as lower-level cadres, and not to frustrate their enthusiasm. This requires leading personnel to go deep into the lower levels in a timely manner and solve problems as soon as they arise. Only in this way can our leadership over the cooperative movement be truly specific and in-depth leadership, and only then can it be proactive, positive, and enthusiastic leadership.

### 一有问题就去解决

    一有问题就去解决
    毛泽东同志在“关于农业合作化问题”报告中，指示各级党委对于合作化运动的检查工作，必须十分抓紧，必须“一有问题就去解决，不要使问题成了堆才去作一次总解决”。现在很多地区的党委已经遵照毛泽东同志这一指示，随着群众运动的高涨，立即进行深入的检查。江苏省盐城专区，群众性的办社高潮已经掀起，中共盐城地委在进行检查以后，向县委和区委发出指示，要“各县委和区委的领导干部均应亲自深入一乡一社，同时推动一般区乡干部，都来进行检查和摸底工作”；“对于已经建成的、正在建立的和准备就要建立的新社，要逐社进行一次全面的检查。”这是十分必要的。只有这样，党的领导才能赶上运动的发展，才能把运动的领导紧紧地掌握在自己手里。
    党委对合作化运动检查的重点，目前应当是注重检查各地传达和贯彻执行党关于农业合作化政策的情况。
    正确地向全体农村党员和干部传达毛泽东同志的指示和六中全会（扩大）的决议，是正确贯彻执行党的合作化政策的第一步。根据河北省委的报告，藁城县委在这方面做得比较好。县委首先从县区的科、股长级干部中，严格选择了能够胜任这项任务的一百零七名干部，先进行了短期训练，使他们对毛泽东同志的指示和六中全会（扩大）决议的精神有比较深刻的和全面的认识。在传达以前，还让他们做好讲话的具体准备，特别是研究如何联系实际进行传达；联系什么、如何联系，都事先想好。这样做的结果，使传达能够为农村党员容易理解，防止了在传达时信口开河、胡乱联系的现象。在传达以后又有计划有组织地领导党员进行讨论，而且还注意解答了党员的问题。可是像藁城县委这样做的还不多，有的地方甚至照文件宣读一遍就草草结束。各地党委应该学习藁城县这种认真负责传达的精神，参考这种“充分准备、联系实际、认真讨论”的经验，根据自己地区的实际情况，做好这个传达工作。
    各级党委领导党员和干部在学习了毛泽东同志的指示和六中全会（扩大）的决议以后，应该马上动员他们向群众进行普遍的宣传。根据福建省委的报告，做得较好的地区，是先开好党员大会和扩大干部会议，在党员和干部有了比较明确和全面的认识以后，就动员党员、干部和积极分子广泛地深入地向群众进行宣传。宣传的时候要讲得全面，讲得透彻；而且要注意结合实际，多举本地的实例。这个宣传工作应该大张旗鼓地进行，使所有男女老少都懂得方针政策和具体办法。但是也有不少地方宣传得不全面，比如只讲依靠贫农，却不讲团结中农。有的地方讲得不透彻，比如只说下中农也是依靠力量，但讲不出道理，也讲不出对上中农的政策。有的地方还是小手小脚地做个别宣传；有的地方又只满足于开大会，不进行深入具体的个别宣传。
    在传达和宣传党的政策中，对于这些好的和不好的情况，各地党委都应该进行及时深入的检查，及时总结和推广好的经验，及时改变不好的做法，在做得不好的地方应该重新补课。使党对合作化的方针政策真正为党员、干部和广大群众所掌握，真正成为推动运动的武器。
    干部和群众要能正确地掌握政策，需要不断地学习政策，也需要在工作中不断地受到实际锻炼。党的领导机关和领导干部的责任，就应该在正确传达和宣传党的政策的同时，正确地领导干部去贯彻执行党的政策，而且还要经常检查他们在贯彻执行中的情况，一有问题就去解决。根据好些省委的报告，各地合作化运动进展很快，而且基本上是很健康的。事实完全证明干部和群众是能够办很多合作社而且能够办得好，能够按照党的政策办事的。但是，合作化运动的规模这样巨大，在运动中出一些缺点和偏差是不可免的。就是在工作做得很好的一个社一个乡一个区，也免不了有缺点。这正说明及时检查工作的重要。只有及时检查出问题才能使领导机关全面地了解运动发展的情况，才能去及时解决问题。
    各级党的领导人员应该亲自下去检查工作，要亲自去看看下级的工作是怎么做的，要帮助下级人员分析缺点和错误产生的原因，找出改正的办法，帮助他们在实际工作中提高他们的能力。检查工作的目的不只是为了发现和纠正缺点，而且还应该注意防止缺点和错误的产生。领导同志应该有预见，要能在深入实际当中，善于看出处在萌芽状态的重大问题，及时提醒下级人员，帮助下级人员想出办法来绕过暗礁。当一种原则性的错误那怕是刚刚露头，就要及时提出批评，帮助他们及时改正，不要老是爱好事后批评。比如目前有些地方已经产生强迫农民入社的现象，虽然是个别的、还不算严重，但也应该及时批评、帮助改正过来。不要等到问题严重了才来专门反对强迫命令。
    当然，对于缺点和错误必须分析。究竟它们在工作中是主导的还是非主导的？是普遍的还是个别的？是主要的还是次要的？是原则性的还是非原则性的？是由客观原因造成的，还是主观原因造成的？这些都要研究清楚，作出正确的判断，不要一发现缺点和错误就大惊小怪，就指责下级，就向群众泼冷水。如果错误已经在改正，就不应该再去责怪下级人员，而是应该鼓励他们改正错误，帮助他们更深刻地认识错误而且想出办法很快改正。如果有些缺点虽然是一些比较重要的缺点，但在目前条件下还不能立即克服，就应当帮助干部准备克服缺点的条件，或者帮助他们作出一个先抓要害、逐步克服的计划；不能逼着他们马上去作，不能希望干部在很短的时间内把一切缺点都克服过来。如果有些缺点是很次要的，可以在适当时候提醒他们注意，不要分散注意力，妨害他们不能把全副力量去注意解决当前最重大的、带根本性质的、关键性的问题。
    毛泽东同志教导党的领导人员应该和下级干部共命运，同呼吸，不要挫折他们的积极性。这就是要求领导人员及时深入下层、一有问题就去解决。只有这样，我们对合作化运动的领导，才是真正具体深入的领导，才是主动的、积极的、热情的领导。
