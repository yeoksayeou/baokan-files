    The Contribution of Soviet Experts to the Construction of Railways in Northwest China
    Li Banmu

    In Northwest China, two railways are being constructed simultaneously, with Lanzhou as the center. One is the Lanxin Railway, which extends westward from Lanzhou across the Yellow River, through the Wushaoling Mountains, out of the Gulang Gorge, and along the Hexi Corridor towards Xinjiang. The other is the Lanyin section of the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway, which extends eastward from Lanzhou across the Yellow River, through Xingxingwan, and across the Tengger Desert directly to Yinchuan.

    The main lines of these two railways pass through deserts, alkaline lands, and swamps, cross the rapidly flowing Yellow River and areas with unstable riverbeds, and traverse hundreds of miles of uninhabited areas, particularly those lacking the water and sand needed for construction. These special conditions constitute complexities in surveying, design, and construction technology. However, these difficulties have not hindered the rapid progress of the railway construction projects. Over the past two years, both railways have completed their traffic tasks in accordance with national requirements. These achievements are inseparable from the assistance of Soviet experts.

    Soviet experts in surveying, geology, and bridge construction traveled extensively across every important area along the Baolan and Lanxin lines, in order to select the most ideal routes for China and to solve the design problems of each key project. Wherever there were difficulties, they went there.

    The Tengger Desert, through which the Baolan Railway passes, is characterized by shifting sands that move with the wind. In the event of strong winds, the completed roadbed could become a sand dune. How to avoid wind and sand erosion? Chinese technicians had no experience in solving this problem. Soviet expert Comrade Shelomintsev visited the site several times, braving the severe cold of the north wind and snow, to conduct detailed surveys. He suggested establishing meteorological observation stations in the desert to observe wind speed, wind direction, sand movement, and evaporation, as a basis for design. At the same time, considering the development of China's railway construction and the possibility of future lines passing through deserts, he suggested conducting a "roadbed demonstration" experiment in the desert to create conditions for future road construction in deserts.

    Based on the expert's suggestions, the designers conducted observations for several months, recording in detail the various changes in the desert. Under the guidance of experts, they developed a plan to conquer the desert and created a "demonstration roadbed." Practice has proved that the expert's suggestions were entirely correct. This suggestion solved the technical problems of building railways in the desert and made a significant contribution to the development of China's railways.

    When the Lanxin Railway enters the territory of Gaotai County, it must pass through a thirty-five-kilometer alluvial fan area. This area is close to the foot of the Qilian Mountains, and more than twenty mountain passes form a continuous alluvial fan zone of about thirty kilometers. Each mountain pass discharges an extremely unstable river channel, and during the flood season, a large amount of flowing sand pours out of the mountain passes. How to avoid the threat of floods and flowing sand when the line passes through this area is a technically complex problem. The original design plan decided to overcome this difficulty by "building a bridge wherever there is a river." In July of this year, Soviet bridge expert Katranov and four other comrades inspected the entire alluvial fan area and pointed out that the "building a bridge wherever there is a river" plan was too wasteful. They proposed three plans: artificial watershed, artificial river channel, and artificial diversion dike. After comparative research, the artificial diversion dike plan was adopted. As a result, seventy of the original design of one hundred large, medium, and small bridges and culverts were reduced, overcoming the difficulty of the line passing through the alluvial fan area and saving a large amount of investment.

    When the Lanxin Railway enters the Zhangye area, according to the original designed route, it would pass south of Zhangye City. In July last year, Soviet consultant Baskeyev, Soviet expert Kavranlov and Comrade Shaburi successively suggested moving the line to the north of the city. After measuring based on this suggestion, compared with the original plan to go south of the city, it not only avoided the eight-kilometer swamp area south of the city, but also shortened the roadbed by 2.5 kilometers and reduced the construction of one station.

    There are countless examples of Soviet experts helping us conquer nature, select the most economical and suitable routes, and design particularly difficult projects. They often say: As a Soviet person, we regard it as a great honor to help the Chinese people build socialism! In their work, they try their best to help us in all aspects, and always consider the long-term interests of our country, fully demonstrating their high degree of internationalism.

    During the surveying of the Baolan Railway, the technicians only cared about completing the surveying tasks for each section, and did not consider the problems of the entire line and future operation. They designed the limiting gradient of the section from Wawashui to Zhongwei as twelve per thousand; and the limiting gradient between Yinchuan and Baotou as six per thousand. After personally inspecting the line, railway expert Nikolaev pointed out that this design would cause great difficulties for future operations. The reason is that the gradient between Baotou and Yinchuan is small, and each train can haul 2,300 tons in the future; the gradient between Wawashui and Zhongwei is large, and each train can haul up to 1,200 tons. This will result in a large transportation capacity between Yinchuan and Baotou, and a small transportation capacity between Zhongwei and Wawashui. In the future, trains departing from Baotou to Lanzhou will inevitably change trains at Zhongwei Station, discarding some vehicles and goods, and then deploying locomotives to pull them; trains departing from Lanzhou to Baotou will require increased tonnage after passing Zhongwei Station. The expert considered that China's industrial construction is developing rapidly, and the transportation tasks undertaken by the railway will also increase day by day. If construction is carried out according to the original design, it will be necessary to take measures to strengthen the passing capacity between Wawashui and Zhongwei in the future (such as adding a second line), causing great waste to the country. Therefore, the expert suggested that the limiting gradient from Wawashui to Zhongwei should also be changed to six per thousand, and only the gradient of the 250 to 312 kilometer section should be changed to twelve point five per thousand, using double-engine traction. This single suggestion alone enables the Baolan Line to operate reasonably and successfully undertake the transportation tasks of national socialist construction.

    The Lanxin Line from Zhangye to Linze must pass through huge rivers such as the Xinhe River, Heihe River, Xihe River, and Mahu River. The characteristics of these rivers are: during the flood season, the river width reaches hundreds of meters or more than a thousand meters, but in the dry season, the river width shrinks. It is very difficult to accurately calculate their water flow. If designed according to the river width during the flood season, it would not only be very wasteful, but also extend the construction period; however, if the correct water flow cannot be calculated, a good and economical bridge design cannot be made. Soviet bridge experts Shaburi and Katranov carefully reviewed the geological data and design documents, and suggested paving the riverbed under the bridge with stone to increase the water flow speed (generally can be increased by about one time). When the flow velocity increases, the bridge holes can be shortened or reduced. As a result of changing the design according to this suggestion, the total length of these large bridges was shortened by 224 meters, saving a large amount of investment for our country.

    Some of our technicians once believed that earthwork and stonework projects were not worth much money, and that a few centimeters more of filling did not matter, so they were sloppy in the design of roadbed filling for a few centimeters more of filling. As a result, many unnecessary wastes were created. At the beginning of this year, the technical design documents for the Qingshui to Zhangye section had been completed and were about to be delivered for construction. In order to ensure the quality of the design, expert Voloshin conducted a comprehensive and detailed review of the line. He discovered that if the design gradient on the longitudinal section diagram were improved, much earthwork could be reduced. In order to obtain the correct conclusion, he extracted a section with a large amount of earthwork from the original design documents and redesigned it with an enlarged longitudinal section diagram, lowering the gradient. Compared with the original design, more than 60,000 cubic meters of earthwork could be reduced in just 7 kilometers of line. Then he studied this section of the line with the technicians of the original design, and proposed suggestions for improving the gradient. After the gradient between Qingshui and Zhangye was changed, a total of 920,000 cubic meters of earthwork was saved, the length of bridges and culverts was shortened, and many unnecessary level crossings were eliminated, reducing the investment by 840,000 yuan compared with the original design. This specific example vividly educated our technicians on how to make careful calculations in design and save construction funds for the country.

    The spirit of the Soviet experts who worked tirelessly and selflessly to help us quickly build the Northwest Railway is even more touching.

    In the preliminary survey of the Lanzhou to Yinchuan section, it was originally selected to take the southern line. In order to further understand the situation of the line, Comrades Kavranlov and Shelomintsev conducted a long-term field investigation. Comrade Shelomintsev, suffering from gastroenteritis, still insisted on going to the construction site. Once, Soviet experts were invited to solve the "large landslide" problem near Baoji. It happened to be raining heavily that day. People could barely stand upright when going up the mountain, but they slipped and could not stand firmly when going down the mountain. Comrade Sergei almost slipped down the mountain. After everyone helped him up, he jokingly said, "There is also a big landslide here!" Everyone laughed. The next day, the rain had not stopped, and the experts wanted to go to the collapsed soil slope to investigate. The leadership, considering that the collapsed soil was soft and fearing danger, instructed the experts to only look around the soil slope. However, as soon as they left the residence, the experts said to everyone, "If we are only allowed to look below, we cannot see clearly, and it is difficult to find the correct solution to the problem." So they insisted on leading everyone to the soil slope.

    Now, Soviet experts are helping us carry out aerial survey work for route selection. The aerial survey work for the Yumen to Hami section has been completed, and the aerial survey work for the Hami to Urumqi section and the border of our country will be carried out soon. The experts once said: "We want to teach our technology to Chinese comrades without reservation, just like drinking a toast, and help China build a great socialist country!"

    苏联专家对西北铁路建设的贡献
    李般木
    在我国的西北，正以兰州为中心，同时修筑两条铁路。一条是从兰州以西跨过黄河，穿过乌鞘岭，出古浪峡，顺着河西走廊向新疆伸展的兰新铁路；一条是从兰州以东跨过黄河，经猩猩湾，穿过腾格里大沙漠直达银川的包（头）兰（州）铁路兰银段。
    这两条铁路的主要线路经过沙漠、硷滩、泥沼，通过急湍奔腾的黄河和没有固定河床的漫流地区，经过数百里内没有人迹、特别是缺乏工程所必需的水和砂石的地区。这种种特殊情况，就构成了勘测设计和施工技术上的复杂性。但是，这些困难并没有阻挡住修路工程的飞跃进展。两年来，这两条铁路都按照国家的要求完成了通车任务。这些成就是同苏联专家的帮助分不开的。
    苏联线路、地质和桥梁等专家为了给我国选出最理想的线路，为了解决每项关键性工程的设计问题，跋山涉水，走遍了包兰、兰新两条线上的每一个重要地区。哪里有困难，他们就到哪里。
    包兰铁路所通过的腾格里沙漠，由于流沙经常随风移动，如遇大风，修好的路基就有变成沙丘的危险。如何避免风沙的侵袭呢？我国技术人员没有解决这个问题的经验。苏联专家谢洛敏切夫同志曾几次亲到现场，冒着朔风卷雪的严寒，进行详细的勘查。他建议在沙漠中建立气象观测站，观测风速、风向、沙量移动和蒸发量等现象，作为设计的依据。同时，他考虑到我国铁路建设事业正在发展，将来还会遇到线路通过沙漠的情况，建议在沙漠中作“路基示范”的试验，为今后在沙漠中修路创造条件。
    设计人员根据专家的建议，进行了历时几个月的观测，详细记录了沙漠中的各种变化。他们在专家的指导下，作出了征服沙漠的方案，作出了“示范路基”。实践证明，专家的建议是完全正确的。这个建议解决了在大沙漠中修铁路的技术问题，为我国铁路的发展作出了巨大的贡献。
    兰新铁路进入高台县境，要穿过三十五公里的漫流地区。这里靠近祁连山麓，有二十多个山口形成了约三十公里连续的冲积扇形地带。每个山口都冲出一条极不固定的河道，一到洪水季节，便有大量的流砂从山口冲出。线路从此通过，怎样避免洪水和流砂的威胁，在技术上是个极复杂的问题。原来的设计方案决定用“见河设桥”的办法克服这个困难。今年七月，苏联桥梁专家卡特兰诺夫等五位同志视察了整个漫流地区，指出“见河设桥”的方案太浪费，提出了人工分水岭、人工河道、人工导水堤三个方案，经过比较研究，采用了人工导水堤的方案。结果，把原来设计的一百座大、中、小桥和涵管减去了七十座，克服了线路通过漫流地区的困难，节约了大量投资。
    兰新铁路进入张掖地区，按原来设计的线路要走张掖城南。去年七月，苏联巴斯克金顾问、苏联专家卡甫兰洛夫和沙布里两同志先后都提出把线路移向城北的建议。根据这个建议测定后，同原走城南的方案比较，不仅避开了城南八公里的泥沼地带，而且缩短了路基二点五公里，少修了一个车站。
    苏联专家帮助我们征服自然，选择最经济、适用的线路，设计特殊困难工程的事例是不胜枚举的。他们常这样说：作为一个苏联人，我们把帮助中国人民建设社会主义看做莫大的光荣！他们在工作中想尽一切办法从各方面帮助我们，处处为我们国家的长远利益打算，充分表现出他们高度的国际主义精神。
    在包兰路的勘测中，技术人员们只顾完成每段的勘测任务，而没有考虑到整个线路和将来运营上的问题。他们把娃娃水到中卫一段的限制坡度设计为千分之十二；把银川至包头间的限制坡度设计为千分之六。线路专家尼古拉也夫同志亲自视察后，指出这个设计会给将来的运营造成极大困难。原因是包头、银川间坡度小，将来每列车可牵引二千三百吨；娃娃水至中卫间坡度大，每列车至多牵引一千二百吨。这样就造成银川、包头间运输能力大，中卫、娃娃水间运输能力小，将来由包头开往兰州的列车，势必在中卫车站换车，甩掉一部分车辆和货物，再另调机车牵引；兰州开往包头的列车通过中卫车站以后又要求增加吨位。专家考虑到我国的工业建设日益发展，铁路担负的运输任务也将日益增加，如按原设计施工，将来势必在娃娃水和中卫间采取加强通过能力的措施（如增修复线），给国家造成极大的浪费。因此，专家建议把娃娃水到中卫间的限制坡度也改为千分之六，只把其中二百五十至三百一十二公里一段的坡度改为千分之十二·五，用双机牵引。只这一项建议就使包兰线将来全线能够合理运营，胜利担负起国家社会主义建设的运输任务。
    兰新线由张掖到临泽一段要经过新河、黑河、西河、马虎河等巨大河流。这些河流的特点是：在洪水季节里，河面宽度达几百公尺或一千多公尺，但枯水季节河面就缩小。要正确地计算它们的流水量是很困难的，如按洪水季节的河面设计，不但浪费很大，而且工期延长；但是，如果不能计算出正确的流水量，就不能作出又好又经济的桥梁设计。苏联桥梁专家沙布里和卡特兰诺夫同志详细审查了地质资料和设计文件后，建议在桥底河床上用石料铺砌，以提高水流速度（一般可提高约一倍左右）。流速提高了，就可缩短或减少桥孔。根据这个建议改变设计的结果，使这几处大桥的总长度缩短了二百二十四公尺，给我们国家节约了大量投资。
    我国的一部分技术人员曾经认为土石方工程值不了多少钱，填方多几公寸算不了什么，因而在路基填方的设计中，对多几公寸的填方就马虎过去了。结果造成很多不应有的浪费。今年初，清水到张掖段的技术设计文件已经作好，就要交付施工了。为了保证设计质量，沃洛勤专家对线路进行了全面细致的审查。他发现：如果把纵断面图上的设计坡度加以改善，可以减少很多土方工程。为了得出正确的结论，他从原设计文件中抽出土方较大的一段，用放大纵断面图重新进行了设计，把坡度降低。同原设计比较，仅仅在七公里的线路中，就可以减少六万多土方。然后他又同原设计这段线路的技术人员研究，提出了改善坡度的建议。清水、张掖间的坡度改变后，共计节省土方九十二万方，缩短了桥涵长度，取消了很多不必要的平交道，比原设计减少了八十四万元的投资。这一个具体事例生动地教育了我们的技术人员，如何在设计中精打细算，为国家节约建设资金。
    苏联专家为了帮助我们迅速建设西北铁路，那种不辞辛苦忘我劳动的精神更是令人感动的。
    兰州到银川段草测中原选定走南线。为了进一步了解线路的情况，卡甫兰诺夫和谢洛敏切夫同志曾作了长时间的实地调查。谢洛敏切夫同志患着肠胃病，仍坚持要到工地去。有一次，苏联专家们被请去宝鸡附近解决“大滑坡”问题。凑巧那天下大雨，人们上山时还能勉强立住脚，下山时滑得无法站稳，谢尔基同志几乎溜下山去。大家扶他起来后，他还打趣地说：“这里也是大滑坡呢！”逗得大家都笑了。第二天，雨还没停，专家就要上塌方土岗去查勘，领导上鉴于塌方土质松软，怕出危险，嘱咐只让专家在土岗周围看一下。可是一离开住地，专家就对大家说：“如果只让我们在下面看，不能看得清楚，问题也难求得正确的解决。”于是坚持领着大家上土岗。
    现在，苏联专家们正帮助我们进行航空选线的测量工作。玉门到哈密一段线路的航测工作已经完成，即将进行哈密到乌鲁木齐和我国边境的航测工作。专家们曾这样说：“我们要和干杯一样，一点不留地把我们的技术教给中国同志，帮助中国建设成伟大的社会主义国家！”
