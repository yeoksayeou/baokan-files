　　National Rural Winter Illiteracy Eradication Work Begins
    (Our Report) The deployment of winter illiteracy eradication work and teacher training in rural areas across the country were completed successively from late October to early November. Currently, illiteracy eradication work is gradually unfolding nationwide.

    During the winter school period this winter and next spring, Hebei Province will mobilize 2.7 million farmers to participate in learning, and plans to eradicate illiteracy among 350,000 of them. In addition to the existing 1,072,000 plus students in regular village schools in 24,985 villages continuing to participate in learning, villages that previously established winter schools and those that did not but now have the conditions to establish them will also restore and establish winter schools. The Hebei Provincial People's Committee has also issued instructions requiring farmers participating in learning to persist for at least 90 days, 140 hours to 200 hours of learning from November this year to the end of March next year, excluding appropriate holidays during the Spring Festival. Shandong Province plans to organize 4 million farmers to participate in winter school cultural learning, and eradicate illiteracy among 400,000 farmers before April next year. Henan Province expects that 4 million farmers will also enter winter schools this winter, and eradicate illiteracy among 700,000 people before the wheat harvest next year. Liaoning Province plans to organize 1 million young and middle-aged illiterate farmers to enter winter schools this year (including more than 300,000 farmers who persist in regular learning) on the basis of regular learning, eradicate illiteracy among 220,000 people, and organize 550,000 people to transfer to regular learning on the basis of winter schools.

    Before the start of winter schools, various localities trained a large number of amateur teachers, who have successively taken up their posts. Hubei Province has trained more than 30,000 teachers through intensive training, with an average of two to three teachers per township. More than 10,000 teachers in Gansu Province have completed training and returned to their hometowns to participate in teaching. In Liaoning Province, each of the 9,000 villages has two or three teachers who have received training. Shaanxi Province has trained more than 30,000 teachers, more than double the number of teachers trained last year. Shandong Province used the method of convening meetings to summarize school management experience to train teachers, and 150,000 teachers across the province participated in such meetings. This year, due to the participation of a large number of junior high school and senior elementary school graduates in peasant cultural education work, the quality of teachers in peasant spare-time schools has been significantly improved. Among the more than 12,000 teachers already trained in Rehe Province, junior high school and senior elementary school graduates account for 70% to 80%. In Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, Hubei, Heilongjiang and other places, rural educated youth enthusiastically responded to the proposal of the National Youth Socialist Construction Activists Conference on illiteracy eradication work, and requested to participate in rural illiteracy eradication work. According to preliminary statistics from seven counties including Xinjiang and Xiangfen in Shanxi, more than 1,900 educated youth submitted guarantees to county and district leaders to respond to the proposal.

    Currently, literacy classes and groups in many places' peasant spare-time schools have successively begun learning. According to statistics from Hengshan County, Hunan Province in October, 90% of the townships have organized peasant spare-time schools, with an enrollment of more than 26,000 people; Changde County has 278 literacy classes and 15 senior elementary school classes that have already started. With the development of the agricultural cooperation movement, more agricultural production cooperatives have opened peasant spare-time schools this year. In Linyi Prefecture, Shandong Province, 10,000 agricultural production cooperatives run schools, accounting for nearly half of the agricultural production cooperatives in the entire prefecture.

    More farmers are demanding enrollment this year. More than 80,000 farmers in Qinghai Province have started winter school, two-thirds more than last year. By November 5th, more than 80,000 farmers in ten counties including Yinan and Junan in Linyi Prefecture, Shandong Province, had enrolled in school. In ten counties including Youxi, Xiapu, and Huian in Fujian Province, 220,000 farmers are attending school, an increase of more than 57,000 people compared with the total number of students last year. In Xixinan Village, Anyang County, Henan Province, an average of one person per household is enrolled in school. In Nonggai Township, Changsha City, Hunan Province, more than 90% of cadres, activists, and young and middle-aged illiterate people have signed up for school.

    Various localities have paid attention to implementing the principle of "learning for practical use" in teaching. Qiantang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Tuoyuan Township, Hengshan County, Hunan Province, and many peasant spare-time schools in Changde County have begun to use their own compiled textbooks, first teaching students to learn the names of people and places in their villages and commonly used characters in daily life, with very good results. Teachers in Liangzhuang Peasant Spare-time School in Banqiao Township, Xuyi County, Jiangsu Province, helped members of the agricultural production cooperative learn to record work points, first teaching them the numbers one to ten and the four characters "day," "month," "work," and "point," and the members have learned to use these characters to record work point accounts. Members reflected, "Learning this way is really useful, learning one is using one."

　　全国农村冬季扫除文盲工作开始
    本报讯　全国各地农村冬季扫盲工作的部署和师资训练工作已在十月下旬至十一月上旬先后结束。目前，扫除文盲工作正在全国范围内逐步展开。
    在今冬明春的冬学期间，河北省将动员二百七十万农民参加学习，并计划扫除其中的文盲三十五万人。除现有的二万四千九百八十五个村的一百零七万二千多名常年民校学员继续参加学习外，过去曾经建立过冬学和过去没有建立过现在有条件建立冬学的村庄，也都将把冬学恢复和建立起来。河北省人民委员会并已发出指示，要求参加学习的农民从今年十一月起到明年三月底止，除春节适当休假外，至少要坚持九十天、一百四十小时到二百小时的学习。山东省计划组织四百万农民参加冬学文化学习，到明年四月以前要扫除四十万农民文盲。河南省预计今冬也将有四百万农民进入冬学，到明年麦收前扫除文盲七十万人。辽宁省今年计划在常年学习的基础上，组织一百万青壮年农民文盲入冬学
  （包括三十多万坚持常年学习的农民），扫除文盲二十二万人，并在冬学的基础上组织五十五万人转入常年学习。
    各地在冬学开学前都训练了大批业余教师，他们已先后走上了工作岗位。湖北省经过集训的教师达三万多名，平均每乡有二名至三名。甘肃全省有一万多名教师已训练结束回乡参加教学工作。辽宁省九千多个乡村，每村都有两、三名教师受到训练。陕西省已经训练了三万多名教师，受训教师人数超过去年一倍以上。山东省采用召开总结办学经验会议的方法培养师资，全省有十五万个教师参加了这种会议。今年由于大批初中和高小毕业生参加农民文化教育工作，使农民业余学校教师的质量有显著提高。热河省已经训练的一万二千多名教师中，初中和高小毕业生占百分之七十到八十。河南、山东、山西、湖北、黑龙江等地农村知识青年热烈响应全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会关于扫除文盲工作的倡议，纷纷要求参加农村扫除文盲工作，仅据山西新绛、襄汾等七个县的初步统计，就有一千九百多名知识青年分别向县区领导方面提出了响应倡议的保证书。
    目前，许多地方的农民业余学校识字班、组已陆续开始学习。据湖南衡山县十月份统计，百分之九十的乡已经组织了农民业余学校，入学人数达二万六千多人；常德县已开学的扫盲班有二百七十八所，另有高小班十五所。随着农业合作化运动的发展，今年各地有更多的农业生产合作社开办了农民业余学校。山东省临沂专区有一万个农业生产合作社办学，它们占全专区农业生产合作社的近半数。
    今年有更多的农民要求入学。青海省已有八万多农民开始上冬学，人数比去年多三分之二。山东省临沂专区沂南、莒南等十个县到十一月五日，已经有八万多农民上学。福建省尤溪、霞浦、惠安等十个县上学的农民有二十二万人，比去年上学总人数增加了五万七千多人。河南省安阳县西辛安村每户平均有一人入学。湖南省长沙市农改乡百分之九十以上的干部、积极分子和青壮年文盲都报名入了学。
    各地在教学中注意贯彻了“学以致用”的方针，湖南省衡山县托源乡浅塘农业生产合作社和常德县许多农民业余学校开始采用自己编的教材，先教学员学会本村的人名、地名和日常生活中的常用字，效果很好。江苏省盱眙县板桥乡梁庄农民业余学校教师帮助农业生产合作社社员学习记工账，先教会社员一到十的数目字和“日”“月”“工”“分”四个字，社员们已经学会用这些字记工分账了。社员反映说，“这样学，真顶事，学一个当一个用。”
