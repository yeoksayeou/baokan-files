　　Unable to Bewitch People

　　Both inside and outside the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference, Western countries exhausted all their propaganda tricks to prove that unifying Germany according to Western conditions is the cornerstone of guaranteeing European security. But unfortunately, not many people were "bewitched" by this propaganda rhetoric.

　　"New York Post" reporters A. Freidin and Bill Richardson reported on November 6th on the views of Western European people on the Western proposition. These two reporters wrote: "Regardless of whether the Western demands for reunification are justified, it is certainly one of the clumsiest examples in history of bad public relations, psychological warfare—call it what you will."

　　They said, "Our propaganda experts are already beginning to wonder why not everyone is completely mesmerized by the West's tactics in Geneva?" The reporters asked: "Do they really think—do Dulles or even Macmillan really think—that the vast public in the Western world will be infinitely excited by what we are trying to do for the Germans?"

　　The "New York Post" reporters pointed out: "Considering the increasing tension over the German issue and the clearly revived nationalism that is becoming more and more arrogant, many people hope that the reunification of Germany can be conditional on peace rather than making peace entirely dependent on the reunification of Germany."

　　The people of Europe hope to first establish a European collective security system in order to pave the way for a reasonable solution to the German question.

　　But the Western countries' plan is to make European security subordinate to German unification, and the unification they want is to annex East Germany by West Germany, opening the way for the revival of German militarism in the whole of Germany. This plan cannot but arouse the concerns of the Western European people. The "New York Post" reporters wrote: "Millions of people in Western Europe are quite suspicious of Germany's actions in the two world wars in the 20th century." The Western countries' proposition makes them "needn't go as far as the Oder to know for whom the bell tolls. The bell tolls louder for their own homes and families than for the reunification of Germany." This is why the Western countries' propaganda rhetoric cannot bewitch peace-loving Western European people.

　　The "New York Post" reporters lamented that the opposition of Western European people to the revival of German militarism is a "reality of life," "and the Western leaders participating in the Geneva conference, immersed in their admittedly difficult intellectual test, do not seem to have grasped this fact."

　　However, when have these "Western leaders" who are obsessed with "power politics" ever grasped a "reality of life"? (Wei)

　　迷不住人
    在四国外长会议会内和会外，西方国家用尽了一切宣传伎俩来证明：按照西方条件统一德国是保证欧洲安全的基石。但是可惜得很，被这种宣传论调“迷”住的人并不多。
    “纽约邮报”的记者亚·弗雷丁和毕尔·理查逊在十一月六日报道了西欧人民对于西方主张的看法。这两位记者写道：“且不说西方提出的重新统一的要求是否正当，肯定地说这是历史上办得最笨的关于恶劣的公众关系、心理战——不论你愿意称呼它是什么——的事例之一。”
    他们说，“我们的宣传专家们已经在开始觉得诧异，想知道为什么不是每一个人都被西方在日内瓦的策略完全迷住呢？”记者们问道：“难道他们真的认为——难道杜勒斯甚至麦克米伦真的认为——西方世界的广大公众会因为我们正在努力为德国人所做的事情而感到无限兴奋吗？”
    “纽约邮报”的记者们指出：“考虑到在德国问题上的紧张关系正在日益加剧而日益嚣张的国家主义已经在明显地复活，许多人都希望使德国的重新统一问题能够以和平为条件而不是使和平完全视德国重新统一问题而定。”
    欧洲人民希望先建立欧洲的集体安全，以便为合理地解决德国问题铺平道路。
    但是西方国家的方案却是要使欧洲安全从属于德国的统一，而它们所要的统一又是用由西德并吞东德的办法，给德国军国主义在全德国复活开辟道路。这种打算不能不引起西欧人民的忧虑。“纽约邮报”的记者们写道：“西欧的千百万人民对于德国在二十世纪两次世界大战中的行径相当猜疑。”西方国家的主张使他们“不必走到奥得河就可以了解在给谁敲丧钟。为他们自己的家园和家人敲的丧钟，倒比为德国重新统一敲的丧钟响得更加紧”。这就是为什么西方国家的宣传论调迷不住爱好和平的西欧人民的原因。
    “纽约邮报”的记者们慨叹说，西欧人民反对德国军国主义复活，这是“生活的现实”，“而沉溺于他们这次公认为困难的智力测验中的参加日内瓦会议的西方领袖们似乎没有能够抓住这个事实”。
    然而，什么时候这些迷恋于“实力政策”的“西方领袖们”又曾经抓住过一回“生活的现实”呢？　（为）
