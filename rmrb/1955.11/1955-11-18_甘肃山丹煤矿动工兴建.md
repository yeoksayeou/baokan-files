Construction has begun on some of the projects at the Shandan Coal Mine in Gansu Province.

The Shandan Coal Mine is currently the largest coal mine in terms of reserves in the Hexi Corridor area of Gansu. Its basic construction projects include four pairs of mine shafts, a power plant to supply power for production, and a dedicated railway line more than 20 kilometers long.

Currently, derricks have been erected on some of the mine shafts at the Shandan Coal Mine, and the work of advancing and lining the mine shafts has begun. The construction of the power plant and the dedicated railway line is also being actively prepared.

All the equipment in the coal mine's production system is modern. Mechanical operations are used for sinking shafts and mining coal, and electric locomotives are used to transport coal. The annual coal production of this coal mine after completion will reach more than 300% of the actual annual coal production of the current Aganzhen Coal Mine. The coal it produces will be used to supply the Lanxin Railway and the Hexi Corridor for industrial construction.

　  甘肃山丹煤矿动工兴建
    甘肃省山丹煤矿部分工程已经动工兴建。
    山丹煤矿是目前甘肃河西走廊一带蕴藏量最大的煤矿。它的基本建设工程项目包括四对矿井和为生产供应动力的电厂以及一条二十多公里长的矿区专用铁路线。
    目前，山丹煤矿部分矿井上已经竖起了井架，开始了矿井井筒的推进、砌碹工作。电厂和铁路专用线工程，也在积极准备施工。
    这个煤矿生产系统的全部设备都是近代化的。挖井、采煤用机械操作，煤块用电气机车运输。这个煤矿建成的年产煤量，将要达到现在阿干镇煤矿实际年产煤量的百分之三百以上。它所产的煤将供应兰新铁路和河西走廊进行工业建设使用。
