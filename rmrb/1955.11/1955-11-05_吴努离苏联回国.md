Now, as you and your entourage are about to leave Moscow, I would like to express, on behalf of the Soviet government, our deep satisfaction once again with your visit to our country. Your goodwill visit clearly demonstrates that although our two countries are far apart, friendly relations between them and close cooperation on many important issues in international life are not only possible, but have already been realized. There is no doubt that after your visit to the Soviet Union, mutual understanding between our two countries will be further strengthened, and economic and cultural cooperation will be further developed.

Finally, on behalf of the Soviet government and the Soviet people, Bulganin asked Prime Minister U Nu to convey friendly greetings to the people of Burma and wished U Nu and others a safe journey.

In his speech, U Nu first expressed his gratitude for the warm reception they received during their visit to the Soviet Union. U Nu said, I feel that the Soviet people do not just treat us as friends. They treat us as dear relatives, and the affection and goodwill they have shown us exceeds our best expectations. I will always remember the happy memories of my very pleasant visit to this hospitable country, and I will always strive to strengthen the friendly ties between our two countries.
