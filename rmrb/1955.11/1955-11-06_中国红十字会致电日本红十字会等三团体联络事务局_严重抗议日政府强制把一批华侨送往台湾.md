Xinhua News Agency, November 5th—The Red Cross Society of China sent a telegram on the 5th to the Liaison Bureau of Three Japanese Organizations including the Japanese Red Cross, the Japan Peace Liaison Committee, and the Japan-China Friendship Association. The text of the telegram is as follows: Liaison Bureau of Three Japanese Organizations (Japanese Red Cross, Japan Peace Liaison Committee, Japan-China Friendship Association), Tokyo:

	(1) Since the Chinese Red Cross Society assisted a large number of Japanese nationals in China who wished to return to their country in the spring of 1955, and declared its conclusion, there are now approximately 130 Japanese nationals who wish to return to Japan and have successively applied to do so. Our Society hereby officially notifies your association that, in order to care for these Japanese nationals, we are willing to continue to provide them with various conveniences and assist them in returning to Japan in accordance with the 1953 "Communiqué on Consultation on Assisting Japanese Nationals to Return Home," following the same methods used in the past to assist large numbers of Japanese nationals in returning home. In addition, four Japanese war criminals, namely Yoshio Koyama, Takeo Shishido, Makoto Susa, and Takuo Masuda, who were handed over by the Mongolian People's Republic to the relevant departments of our government for handling, have been entrusted by the relevant departments of our government to our Society to assist them in returning to Japan. Furthermore, the remains of forty Japanese war criminals, with the consent of the relevant departments of our government, can be sent back to Japan together with the aforementioned Japanese nationals who wish to return and the four war criminals. Please have your three organizations' Liaison Bureau send a ship to Tanggu Port between November 15th and 20th to pick them up. Please inform us by telegram when the ship will arrive.

	(2) As the facts have shown in the past, the Chinese people and government, proceeding from the desire to promote friendship between the Chinese and Japanese peoples, have consistently provided various conveniences and assistance for matters related to the return of Japanese nationals in China who wish to return home. However, according to the materials published by the Fifth Congress of the Japan-China Friendship Association, the Japanese government has subjected Chinese nationals detained in the Hamamatsu "detention center" to various forms of abuse and persecution. At the same time, according to reports from Kyodo News on October 31st and November 4th, the Japanese government forcibly sent 120 Chinese nationals to Taiwan and beat Chinese nationals who refused to be forcibly sent to Taiwan. Our Society expresses its serious protest against this inhuman atrocity by the Japanese government. We believe that your three organizations have a duty to investigate this matter and promptly inform our Society of the results of the investigation; we also hope that your three organizations will take effective measures in accordance with the agreement to continue to assist Chinese nationals in Japan who wish to return to China.

	(3) Our Society reiterates that in the future, if individual Japanese nationals in China apply to return home, we will continue to assist them in returning to Japan. Regarding the issues of free travel between China and Japan for nationals of both sides and the mutual return of the remains of the deceased, an agreement has already been reached in the joint communiqué issued on October 18th by Peng Zhen, Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of our country, and Eikichi Kamabayashi, head of the Japanese Diet members' delegation visiting China. In order to implement this provision in the joint communiqué, we hope that your three organizations will form a delegation to come to Beijing to discuss with our Society the specific issues of realizing the free travel of nationals of both countries and the mutual return of the remains of the deceased. Please let us know your opinion on this matter.

Xinhua News Agency, November 5th - According to a Kyodo News dispatch from Kobe on the 5th, one hundred and twenty Chinese nationals who were forcibly escorted from the Hamamatsu "detention center" to Kobe by the Japanese authorities on the morning of November 4th, have been forcibly put on the Japanese ship "Hakuryu Maru" by the Japanese authorities against their will. The ship set sail for Keelung, Taiwan at 3 p.m. that day.

According to Kyodo News, among this group of Chinese nationals, "those originally from Taiwan and those originally from various provinces on the mainland such as Guangdong and Shandong each account for half." Obviously, in order to suppress their resistance, the Japanese government specially dispatched "about 30 people, including the Chief of the Public Security Section of the Fifth Regional Coast Guard Headquarters, Kyogahara, and security officers to accompany them."

Xinhua News Agency, November 5th - An Associated Press report from Kobe on the 4th revealed some of the truth about the Japanese government's brutal suppression and forced deportation of Chinese nationals detained in the Hamamatsu "detention center" to Taiwan.

According to the Associated Press, more than two hundred overseas Chinese are being detained in the Hamamatsu detention camp. They have already served the sentences imposed on them for crimes that were forced upon them. "Most of the detainees want to live in Japan; while some want to go to Communist China if they have to be deported." However, the Japanese government is determined to send them to Taiwan.

Before dawn on November 4th, the Japanese authorities transported 124 overseas Chinese from the Hamamatsu "detention center" to Kobe in order to use the Japanese ship "Hakuryu Maru" to escort them to Taiwan. At this time, seven overseas Chinese refused to be sent to Taiwan and "demanded that they be sent to China." However, the "guards in the Hamamatsu 'detention center' wanted to force them to be dragged away." More than ninety overseas Chinese remaining in the Hamamatsu detention camp stepped forward to support their suffering compatriots. The Japanese guards actually "called the police," and "the two sides desperately waved wooden sticks and started a tense battle." "One hundred and forty police officers used batons to suppress the situation."

An official from the Japanese government's Immigration Bureau said that the conflict lasted for four hours. One overseas Chinese was seriously injured. Another seventy Chinese nationals and Japanese were also injured, although the injuries were not so serious. Eighteen overseas Chinese have been detained by the Japanese police authorities.

Even after this bloody conflict occurred, according to the Associated Press, "six of the seven people who refused to be deported were tied up and sent to Kobe... and put on the ship." The other person was able to stay in Hamamatsu for treatment because he was beaten.

    中国红十字会致电日本红十字会等三团体联络事务局
    严重抗议日政府强制把一批华侨送往台湾
    新华社五日讯　中国红十字会总会在五日致电日本红十字会、日本和平联络会、日中友好协会三团体联络事务局。电文如下：东京日本红十字会、日本和平联络会、日中友好协会三团体联络事务局：
    （一）自从一九五五年春中国红十字会总会协助愿意回国的在华日侨大批回国宣告结束以后，目下又有一百三十名左右愿意返回日本的日侨陆续申请回国。现我会正式通知贵会：我会为了照顾这些日侨，愿意根据一九五三年“关于商洽协助日侨回国问题的公报”，继续按照过去协助大批日侨回国时的办法，对这些日侨给以各种方便并协助他们返回日本。此外，由蒙古人民共和国移交给我国政府有关部门处理的日本战犯四名，即小山义士、宍户武男、须佐诚、增田琢雄，我国政府有关部门已委托我会协助他们返回日本。另有四十名日本战犯的遗骨，经我国政府有关部门同意，可以同上述愿意回国的日侨及四名战犯一起送回日本。请贵三团体联络事务局派船于十一月十五日到二十日之间到塘沽港接运。来船何时到达，希来电告知。
    （二）如历来事实所表明的，我国人民和政府从促进中日两国人民友好的愿望出发，对于愿意回国的在华日侨的回国的有关事宜，是一贯地予以各种便利和协助的。但是，根据日中友好协会第五次大会所公布的材料，日本政府对于被拘押在滨松
  “收容所”的中国侨民曾施加各种虐待和迫害；同时，根据共同社十月三十一日和十一月四日的报道，日本政府竟把中国侨民一百二十人强制送交台湾，并且对拒绝被强制送交台湾的中国侨民施行殴打。我会对于日本政府这种违反人道的暴行，表示严重抗议。我们认为贵三团体有义务对此进行调查并且将调查结果迅速告知我会；更盼望贵三团体根据协议，采取有效措施，继续协助愿意回国的在日华侨返回中国。
    （三）我会再次表明，今后在华日侨，如有个别申请回国的，我会将继续协助其返回日本。关于中日双方侨民自由往返中日两国之间和双方相互送还死亡者遗骨等问题，在今年十月十八日公布的我国全国人民代表大会常务委员会秘书长彭真和日本国会议员访华团团长上林山荣吉的联合公报中已经达成协议。为了执行联合公报中这一规定，希望贵三团体组成代表团前来北京，同我会商讨实现有关两国侨民自由来往和互相送还死亡者遗骨的具体问题。贵方意见如何，望告。

                      一九五五年十一月五日
    新华社五日讯　据共同社五日从神户发出的消息说，十一月四日清晨被日本当局用暴力从滨松“收容所”押送到神户的一百二十名中国侨民，已被日本当局违反他们的意志强制装上日船“白龙丸”。当天下午三时，这艘轮船即启碇驶往台湾的基隆。
    据共同社说，在这批中国侨民中，“原籍台湾和原籍广东、山东等大陆各省的人各占半数”。显然是为了要镇压他们的反抗，日本政府特为派出了“第五管区海上保安本部公安科长乡原和警备官等约计三十人同行”。
    新华社五日讯　合众社记者四日从神户发出的消息，透露了日本政府采取残暴的镇压手段，把被拘留在滨松“收容所”的中国侨民强制押送台湾去的若干真相。
    据合众社说，在滨松拘留营拘留着二百多个华侨。他们已经服满了因为强加在他们头上的罪行而被判的刑期。“大部分的被拘留者希望住在日本；而有一些人希望到共产党中国去，如果他们一定要受到驱逐的话。”但是，日本政府却硬要把他们送往台湾去。
    十一月四日黎明以前，日本当局把一百二十四个华侨从滨松“收容所”运往神户，以便用日船“白龙丸”把他们押送到台湾。这时，有七个华侨拒绝被送往台湾，并且“要求把他们送到中国去”。但是，滨松“收容所”的“警卫人员想要强迫把他们拉走”。留在滨松拘留营的九十多个华侨挺身出来支援他们的受难的同胞。日方警卫人员竟“叫来了警察”，于是，“双方拚命挥舞木棒开始了一场紧张的战斗”。“一百四十个警察用警棍镇压”。
    日本政府入国管理局的官员说，这次冲突持续了四小时。有一个华侨受重伤。另外七十个中国侨民和日本人也受了伤，虽然伤势并不那么严重。有十八个华侨已被日本警察当局扣留起来。
    甚至在这次流血冲突发生之后，据合众社说，“七名拒绝遣送的人中有六名被绑到神户……送上船。”另外一人因为被打伤才得以留在滨松治疗。
