　　Two Cooperatives, One Heart
　　In Tangjiazhuang, Yangzhai District, Zibo City, Shandong Province, two new cooperatives were established, one in the east village and one in the west village. Both cooperatives faced some difficulties in production after their establishment. The West Cooperative planned to plant seventy-five mu of wheat, but lacked sufficient manure. The East Cooperative had a weaker core force, and the production order in the cooperative was still quite chaotic. Cadres often argued over scoring work points. Considered separately, the difficulties of the two cooperatives were difficult to solve in the short term. But looked at together, the situation was completely different. The heads of these two cooperatives both had relatively broad vision and were able to help others, and as a result, they were able to receive help from others. Zhou Guanghai, head of the East Cooperative, said: "The West Cooperative lacks manure for planting wheat, and we have accumulated a lot of manure. Why not lend them some?" Zhang Zhongming, head of the West Cooperative, was also telling the cooperative members: "The East Cooperative is so chaotic, we can't just stand by and do nothing!"
　　After learning about these situations, the Party branch secretary of the township convened a meeting of the cooperative management committees of the two cooperatives, pointing out to them that learning from each other's strengths to overcome their weaknesses was the best way to overcome the difficulties of the two cooperatives. The branch secretary spoke the minds of the cooperative members of both cooperatives. After the meeting, the East Cooperative immediately gave part of the manure from the school to the West Cooperative; in addition, it lent one hundred carts of sheep manure; the township branch helped the West Cooperative to adjust the strength of the Party members, Youth League members, and activists within the cooperative, and drew people to support the East Cooperative, helping them to sort out the work accounts and divide up the production organization. The difficulties of the two cooperatives were resolved. The members of the two cooperatives have since become as close as brothers.

　　两个社一条心
    山东淄博市杨寨区唐家庄，村东村西各建了一个新社。这两个社建立后生产上都有些困难。西社计划种七十五亩麦子，但是粪不够。东社骨干力量较弱，社里生产秩序还比较混乱，为了评分，干部常常吵架。分开来看，两个社的困难问题都一时难以解决。但是合起来看，情况就完全不同。这两个社的社长都有比较远大的眼光，能帮助别人，结果也就能得到别人的帮助。东社社长周光海说：“西社种麦少粪，我们积粪很多，为什么不借给他们一部分。”西社社长张仲明也在对社员说：“东社这么乱，咱们不能看着不管！”
    乡的党支部书记了解这些情况后，就召集两社的社务委员开会，向他们指出取长补短是克服两社困难的最好的办法。支部书记说出了两社社员的心里话。会后东社马上把学校中的一部分粪让给了西社；另外还借给了一百车羊粪；乡支部帮助西社把社内的党员、团员和积极分子的力量作了调整，抽出人来支援东社，帮助他们清理了工账，划分了生产组织，两社的困难问题都解决了。两社的社员从此成了亲兄弟。
