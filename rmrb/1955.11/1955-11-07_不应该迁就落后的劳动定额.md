We Shouldn't Accommodate Backward Labor Quotas
Kun Gang

In our country, labor quotas for industrial and construction enterprises are formulated based on the conditions of machinery and equipment and the average advanced technical level of workers. Therefore, most workers can meet or exceed the quotas set by the state. However, some workers may temporarily fall short of the quotas. How should we deal with these workers? To answer this question, let's look at two different approaches taken by several construction units under the Central South Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Construction.

One approach is to carry out labor competitions, mobilize workers to break through state quotas, and help workers solve problems in production. The Third Engineering Division of the Central South Engineering Bureau adopted this method. Workers generally exceeded their quotas, completing 31% more than the state plan in August and saving more than 2,000 yuan in basic wages. In September, they saved another 8,053 yuan in basic wages and completed 10% more than the monthly plan. This approach not only ensured the speed of national construction and reduced basic wage expenditures but also allowed workers to receive extra wages.

There is also another approach, such as in a project of the First Engineering Division of the Central South Engineering Bureau, which originally should have been completed with thirty workdays. However, the workers used sixty workdays to complete it. So the foreman canceled the originally issued task order and paid the workers wages according to the hourly wage method. In a concrete project of the Second Engineering Division, according to the quota, only sixty-nine workdays were needed to complete it, but the foreman was afraid that the workers would not be able to complete the quota and would not receive their basic wages, so he increased it to seventy-eight workdays and dispatched other workers to help them with odd jobs and difficult tasks. Many other units are also doing this, implementing hourly wages when workers encounter difficult tasks and piece-rate wages for light tasks. Or they simply lower the state-stipulated quotas, allowing workers to "reach" and "break through" labor quotas effortlessly.

The latter approach gives the same wages to workers who complete tasks well and those who do not, which violates the socialist principle of "to each according to his work," making workers who work well feel unfair and failing to urge workers to care about the completion of national construction tasks from a material perspective and failing to stimulate them to work hard to improve their technical level. This approach also increases the state's wage expenditure. In the first half of this year, some units under the Central South Engineering Bureau increased wage expenditures in order to "take care" of workers who did not meet the state-stipulated labor quotas, resulting in the bureau exceeding its basic wage budget by more than 33%.

Obviously, for the benefit of national construction and the interests of the entire working class, we must advocate the former approach and resolutely oppose the latter. Mobilizing all employees to strive to meet and break through the state construction engineering labor quotas, and to fight for the overfulfillment of various planned targets, and helping workers improve their technical level and overcome difficulties, is the only correct path that leaders of construction enterprises should choose.

    不应该迁就落后的劳动定额
    崑岗
    在我们国家里，工业企业和建筑企业的劳动定额是根据机器设备条件和工人平均先进技术水平来制定的，所以一般工人都能达到或超过国家规定的定额。但是，也有些工人暂时还达不到定额。对于这些工人，应该怎样办呢？为了答复这个问题，让我们来看看建筑工程部中南工程管理局所属的几个施工单位所采取的两种不同的做法。
    一种做法是开展劳动竞赛，动员工人突破国家定额，并且帮助工人解决生产中的问题。中南工程管理局第三工程处采取这种方法，工人普遍超过定额，八月份超额百分之三十一完成国家计划，节约基本工资二千多元。九月份又节约基本工资八千零五十三元，超额百分之十完成了月计划。这种做法，既保证了国家的建设速度，减少了基本工资的支出，工人又得到了超额工资。
    也有另一种做法，如中南工程管理局第一工程处有一项工程，本来应该用三十个工就可以完成。但是，工人们用了六十个工才完成。于是工长就取消了原先签发的任务单，按照计时工资的办法给工人发了工资。第二工程处有一项混凝土工程，按照定额只需要六十九个工就可以完成，但是工长怕工人完不成定额，得不到基本工资，就给加到七十八个工，并且加派了别的工人来帮助他们做零星活和难做的活。还有许多单位也是这样，当工人遇到难做的活，就实行计时工资，做轻便的活，就实行计件工资。或者是随便降低国家规定的定额，使得工人不费力地就“达到”了和“突破”了劳动定额。
    后面的这种做法使完成任务好的和完成任务不好的工人都得到一样的工资，违反了“按劳取酬”的社会主义原则，使劳动得好的工人感到不公平，不能从物资利益上督促工人关心国家建设任务的完成，不能刺激他们努力提高技术水平。这种做法也增加了国家的工资支出。今年上半年，中南工程管理局所属的一些单位，因为要“照顾”达不到国家规定劳动定额的工人，增加了工资支出，以致该局基本工资超支百分之三十三以上。
    显然，为了国家建设的利益和全体工人阶级的利益，我们必须提倡前面一种做法，坚决反对后面一种做法。动员全体职工为达到和突破国家建筑工程劳动定额，并且为超额完成各项计划指标而斗争，帮助工人提高技术水平，克服困难，这是建筑企业的领导人员所应该选择的唯一正确的路。
