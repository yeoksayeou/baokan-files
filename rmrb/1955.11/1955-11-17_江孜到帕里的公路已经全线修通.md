Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 16th. The Gyantse-Phari highway, with a total length of more than 150 kilometers, has been fully completed. The first batch of vehicles from Gyantse arrived in Phari on the 14th. After this highway is connected to the Shigatse-Gyantse highway, which opened to traffic in October this year, it will further strengthen the connection between the Himalayan region and other parts of Tibet, as well as the interior of the motherland, and provide favorable conditions for the development of trade between China and India.

The Gyantse-Phari highway was started in mid-October by the State Council using the method of "work-for-relief". The highway passes through areas with an average altitude of more than 4,000 meters, and passes through the main vein of the Himalayas. Most of the migrant workers who participated in the road construction were farmers from both sides of the Nyang Chu River who suffered from floods in 1954. During the construction period, they overcame the attacks of wind and snow in the early winter on the plateau and completed the construction task ten days ahead of the original plan.

Phari is located under the peaks of the Himalayas and is one of the trading markets designated by the Chinese government in the "Agreement between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of India on Trade and Transportation between the Tibet Region of China and India" signed in Beijing on April 29, 1954.

　　江孜到帕里的公路已经全线修通
    新华社拉萨十六日电　全长一百五十多公里的江孜到帕里公路已经全线修通。从江孜驶来的第一批汽车在十四日开到了帕里。这条公路同今年十月间通车的日（喀则）江（孜）公路相接以后，使喜马拉雅山区同西藏其他地区以及祖国内地的联系更密切了，并且为发展中、印两国之间的贸易提供了有利条件。
    江孜到帕里公路是国务院采用以工代赈的方式在十月中旬动工修筑的，公路经过的地方平均拔海四千公尺以上，中间经过喜马拉雅山的主脉。参加修路的民工大部分是年楚河两岸一九五四年遭受水灾的农民，他们在施工期间，克服了高原初冬风雪的袭击，按原订计划提前十天完成了修筑任务。
    帕里在喜马拉雅山高峰之下，是一九五四年四月二十九日在北京签订的中华人民共和国、印度共和国关于中国西藏地方和印度之间的通商和交通协定中由中国政府指定的贸易市场之一。
