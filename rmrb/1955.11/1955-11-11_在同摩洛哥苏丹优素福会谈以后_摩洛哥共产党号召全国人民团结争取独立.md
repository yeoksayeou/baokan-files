　　Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 10th dispatch from TASS: A delegation from the Moroccan Communist Party, headed by its General Secretary Ali Yata, visited Sultan Yusuf, who is temporarily residing in France, on the 8th.

　　Following the meeting, the delegation issued a statement to the press, re-emphasizing the need for unity among the Moroccan people. The statement said that the new Moroccan government should be composed of representatives from all national trade union federations and political parties—including the Communist Party. This government must negotiate with France to abolish the protectorate treaty, recognize national independence, and restore close and fruitful cooperation with France on the basis of equality and mutual respect for each other's rights. This government must achieve Morocco's territorial unity, and also prepare for the election of a Moroccan parliament on the basis of universal suffrage. This parliament must approve the new Franco-Moroccan agreement, formulate a democratic constitution, and establish a new government.

　　The Moroccan Communist Party believes that before negotiating with France, it is necessary to restore calm and freedom in Morocco, which means ending the state of emergency, lifting the ban on the Communist Party and the nationalist "Independence Party," releasing political prisoners, rescinding death sentences, and restoring freedoms of publication and assembly.

　　在同摩洛哥苏丹优素福会谈以后
　　摩洛哥共产党号召全国人民团结争取独立
    新华社十日讯　塔斯社巴黎讯：以摩洛哥共产党总书记阿里·雅塔为首的摩洛哥共产党代表团八日访问了暂时住在法国的苏丹优素福。
    会谈以后，代表团向报界发表一项声明，重新强调指出摩洛哥全国人民团结的必要。声明说，摩洛哥新政府应该由所有全国性的工会联合会和政党——包括共产党在内——的代表组成。这个政府必须同法国谈判取消保护国条约、承认民族独立和在平等和互相尊重各自的权利的条件下恢复同法国的密切而有结果的合作。这个政府必须取得摩洛哥的领土统一，并且还要筹备在普选的基础上选举摩洛哥议会，必须由这个议会来批准新的法国—摩洛哥协定、制定民主宪法和成立新政府。
    摩洛哥共产党认为，在同法国谈判之前，必须先恢复摩洛哥的平静局势和自由，这就是要结束紧急状态，取消对共产党和民族主义党派“独立党”的禁令，释放政治犯，取消死刑判决，恢复出版、集会等自由。
