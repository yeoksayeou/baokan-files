Local industries bear multiple tasks in the Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy. Some local industries must cooperate with central state-owned industries to serve the needs of national construction and the lives of the people across the country; some must supply building materials for local basic construction; some must produce certain auxiliary materials and parts for central state-owned industries, and undertake certain repair tasks. These tasks are very important and should be completed. However, the most important task of local industries should be to serve the needs of local agricultural production and rural life. Because local industry mainly serves the needs of the local area, and a very important part of the needs of the local area is the production and life needs of farmers.

Local industries must implement the policy of serving the rural economy and closely integrating with the rural economy. China's First Five-Year Plan stipulates: "Local industries that are balanced within the scope of the local area, under the policy of implementing service to the rural economy and close integration with the rural economy, should make their production and construction adapt to the new requirements put forward by agriculture and handicraft industry in the process of gradual cooperation. In terms of means of production, produce agricultural tools, agricultural machinery, fertilizers, rural transportation tools and hand tools, etc., and pay attention to developing agricultural tool repair and feed processing businesses; in terms of daily necessities, produce a wide variety of good quality products."

In recent years, some provinces have made considerable achievements in implementing the policy of local industry serving the rural economy and closely integrating with the rural economy. The local industrial departments of Hebei Province have successfully trial-produced many new types of agricultural tools, water wheels, power machinery, etc. needed by farmers in the province in the past year, which have been warmly welcomed by the majority of farmers, and have played a certain role in increasing agricultural production and promoting the development of the agricultural cooperation movement. At the same time, the situation that the production equipment capacity could not be brought into play in the past has also changed, and some enterprises are now producing products that cannot meet demand. The local industrial departments of Henan Province and Anhui Province have also started to do this. Next year, the total value of products of local industry in Henan Province serving the rural economy will increase by 15 million to 17 million yuan, and Anhui Province will also have a considerable increase. Heilongjiang Province has also begun to pay attention to this issue, and the local industries in Suihua and other counties under the province have begun to implement the policy of serving the rural economy. Shanxi Province and Hubei Province are currently actively preparing, and Guangdong Province and Jiangsu Province are also starting to work in this direction.

However, it should be pointed out that there are still many provinces that have not well implemented the policy that local industry must serve the rural economy and be closely integrated with the rural economy. Some people in charge of local industry in some provinces one-sidedly believe that the rural market is small, and the purchasing power of farmers, especially the ability to purchase means of production, is limited. Producing those commodities sold in the rural areas of the province has a small output value and low profit, so they turn their eyes to the cities and other places, and want to produce products with large output value and high profit. Some people in charge of local industries in some provinces do not conduct in-depth investigations and research in rural areas, so they do not understand the urgent needs of farmers in production and life. When they encounter some difficulties, they waver and believe that local industry serving the rural economy is not the main task, or blindly stipulate production tasks, and produce whatever the central state-owned industry produces. There are also some people in charge of local industry in some cities and provinces who see that farmers have a large and urgent need for consumer goods, so they believe that local industry should mainly produce consumer goods needed by rural areas, while not actively organizing the production of means of production needed by rural areas. Many facts have proved that once local industry is separated from farmers, who account for the majority of the population and the largest part of social purchasing power, its own development encounters great difficulties, the equipment capacity of many factories cannot be brought into play, and the country cannot well coordinate various economies, making the transformation of handicrafts unable to proceed smoothly.

Changing the situation in which local industry is detached from the rural economy and enabling local industries in various provinces to implement the policy of serving the rural economy has more important practical significance in the current situation. Because the upsurge of the national agricultural cooperation movement has begun to arrive, with the development of the agricultural cooperation movement, the expansion of agricultural production scale, and the participation of the vast number of farmers in cooperatives, it is possible to accumulate funds to carry out some basic construction, improve agricultural tools, and increase the application of fertilizers, etc., which requires industry to supply agriculture with various means of production, such as new agricultural tools, a large number of water conservancy machines and grain processing machines, mineral fertilizers, pesticides and pesticide equipment, etc. At the same time, as the income of farmers participating in agricultural production cooperatives increases day by day, they have also put forward a variety of new requirements in terms of consumer goods, such as clothing, knitwear, bicycles, rubber shoes, more refined foods, etc. This shows that with the increasing development of the agricultural cooperation movement, the need for industrial products will become larger and larger in quantity, and more and more in variety.

Under this situation, local industry must increase production and make products suitable for the specific needs of rural areas. Only in this way can we promote the consolidation and development of agricultural production cooperatives, promote the realization of agricultural production increase plans, adapt the development of agriculture to the country's needs for grain, cotton and other crops, and ensure the gradual realization of socialist industrialization.

For local industry to serve the rural economy and closely integrate with the rural economy, a series of transformation work must be carried out. Not only must socialist transformation be carried out on private industry and individual handicrafts, but also the strength of various economic components of industry must be well organized, and appropriate transformation must be carried out in terms of technology and production organization. In this process of transformation, it is impossible to imagine that certain difficulties and obstacles will not occur. However, difficulties and obstacles can be overcome. If local industry does not actively transform itself, the difficulties and obstacles it will encounter in the future will be even greater, and it will put itself in a more passive position.

The experience of Hebei Province can be used as a reference for overcoming difficulties and obstacles. Although the development of local industry in Hebei Province once took some detours, when the people in charge of local industry understood the importance of the party and the country's policy on local industry, they resolutely struggled to implement this policy. They have a sense of responsibility and enthusiasm for supporting the socialist revolution movement in rural areas and improving the lives of farmers, and therefore have achieved certain results in their work. The leading departments of local industries in various provinces must improve the socialist responsibility and enthusiasm of their subordinate enterprises and all personnel when implementing the party and the country's policies, so that they sincerely serve the rural economy and the masses of farmers.

In order to serve the rural economy and the masses of farmers, local industry should adopt some specific methods. For example, the local industry organization of Hebei Province organizes rural visits, establishes regular contact with agricultural production cooperatives, draws on the practical experience of farmers to manufacture new products, organizes private industry and handicraft industry to establish agricultural tool repair and matching networks, teaches farmers to use new agricultural tools, etc., which are very good methods. Of course, the industrial enterprises in various places, what products to produce, how much to produce, where to start, should be adapted to the local natural conditions and resource conditions, equipment capacity and technical level, as well as the farming habits and living habits of local farmers, and the natural conditions of agriculture. In this way, we can prevent blindness and strengthen planning.

At present, agricultural cooperation movements are being carried out throughout the country and comprehensive plans for agricultural production are being formulated. The local industrial leading departments in various places must pay attention to combining this plan to formulate a comprehensive and long-term plan for the development of local industry. In the process of formulating this plan, attention should be paid to the following issues: First, on the one hand, we must focus on considering the various requirements put forward by the great development of the local agricultural cooperation movement to local industry, and consider the various requirements put forward by the development of local forestry, animal husbandry, fishery, handicraft industry, sideline business, etc. to local industry, on the other hand, we must also consider the local resource conditions, the equipment capacity of industrial production, the technical level, and the regional distribution, etc., that is, determine the development prospects of local industry based on needs and possibilities. Second, this plan should be adapted to the requirements of national balance, that is, to solve the problem of division of labor and cooperation between local industry and central state-owned industry. Third, the production of local state-owned industry, cooperative industry, joint state-private industry, private industry and handicraft industry should be unified and arranged to cooperate with each other, and at the same time, the steps and specific progress of the socialist transformation of private industry and handicraft industry should be planned. In this way, various places can correctly exert the potential strength of the local economy, and make the development of local industry adapt to the development of local agricultural cooperation in steps.

The high tide of the national agricultural cooperation movement has arrived. All employees of local industrial departments should actively meet this upsurge, support agricultural cooperation, and accelerate the development speed of local industry itself, improve quality, and greatly strengthen the socialist forces in local industry.

### 地方工业必须贯彻执行为农村经济服务的方针

　　地方工业必须贯彻执行为农村经济服务的方针
    在发展国民经济的五年计划中，地方工业担负着多方面的任务。有一部分地方工业要配合中央国营工业，为国家建设和全国人民生活的需要服务；有的要为当地的基本建设供应建筑材料；有的要给中央国营工业生产某些辅助材料和配件，并担负一定的修配任务。这些任务很重要，应该完成。但是，地方工业最重要的一项任务，应该是为当地农业生产和农村生活的需要服务。因为地方工业主要是为本地方的需要服务，而本地方的需要，很重要的一部分是农民的生产和生活的需要。
    地方工业必须执行为农村经济服务并同农村经济密切结合的方针。我国第一个五年计划规定：“属于本地方范围内平衡的地方工业，在贯彻为农村经济服务并同农村经济密切结合的方针下，应该使它们的生产和建设适应农业和手工业在逐步合作化过程中所提出的新要求。在生产资料方面，出产农具、农械、肥料、农村交通工具以及手工工具等，并注意发展农具修配和饲料加工的业务；在日用品方面，出产多种多样的质量良好的产品。”
    近年以来，有些省份在贯彻执行地方工业为农村经济服务并同农村经济密切结合的方针方面，已经做出了不少成绩。河北省的地方工业部门一年来试制成功了本省农民所需要的许多新式农具、水车、动力机械等等，受到了广大农民的热烈欢迎，对于增加农业生产和促进农业合作化运动的发展，都起了一定的作用。同时，过去生产设备能力不能发挥的情况也改变了，有些企业所生产的产品现在已经供不应求。河南省和安徽省的地方工业部门也开始这样做了。明年河南省的地方工业在为农村经济服务方面的产品总值将增加一千五百万元到一千七百万元，安徽省也有相当数量的增长。黑龙江省也已开始注意这个问题，该省所属的绥化等县的地方工业已开始贯彻执行为农村经济服务的方针。山西省和湖北省目前正在积极准备，广东省和江苏省也在开始向着这方面努力。
    但是，应该指出，还有不少的省份，并没有很好地贯彻执行地方工业必须为农村经济服务并同农村经济密切结合的方针。有些省份领导地方工业的人员片面地认为农村市场狭小，农民的购买力特别是购买生产资料的能力有限、生产那些在本省农村销售的商品，产值小，利润低，因而就把眼睛向着城市，向着外地，一心想生产那些产值大、利润高的产品。有些省份领导地方工业的人员，不深入农村调查研究，因而不了解农民在生产上和生活上的迫切需要，当他们碰到一些困难以后，也就动摇起来，认为地方工业为农村经济服务不是主要的任务，或者盲目地规定生产任务，看到中央国营工业生产什么，自己也生产什么。还有一些省市领导地方工业的人员，看到农民对生活消费品的需要量很大，需要很急，于是认为地方工业应该主要生产农村所需要的生活消费品，而对于农村所需要的生产资料，却不积极地组织生产。许多事实证明，当地方工业一旦脱离了占人口大多数和占社会购买力最大部分的农民的时候，就使本身的发展遇到了很大困难，许多工厂的设备能力不能发挥，并且使国家不能很好统筹安排各种经济，使改造手工业的工作不能顺利进行。
    改变地方工业同农村经济相脱节的状况，使各省的地方工业贯彻执行为农村经济服务的方针，在当前情况下有更重要的实际意义。因为全国农业合作化运动的高潮已开始到来，随着农业合作化运动的发展，农业生产规模的扩大，参加合作社的广大农民有可能积聚资金来进行一些基本建设、改良农具和增施肥料等等，这就要求工业供给农业以各种生产资料，如新式的农具、大量的水利机器和谷物的加工机器、矿物肥料、农药和农药器械等等。同时，由于参加农业生产合作社的农民收入日益增加，在生活消费品方面，也提出了多种多样的新要求，如成衣、针织品、自行车、胶鞋、较精制的食品等等。这说明了，随着农业合作化运动的日益开展，对工业品的需要，在数量上将越来越大，在种类上将越来越多。
    在这种形势下面，地方工业必须增加生产，并且使产品适合于农村的具体需要。只有这样，才能促进农业生产合作社的巩固和发展，促进农业增产计划的实现，使农业的发展同国家对粮食、棉花和其他农作物的需要相适应，保证社会主义工业化的逐步实现。
    地方工业要做到为农村经济服务并同农村经济密切结合，必须进行一系列的改造工作。不仅对私营工业和个体手工业要进行社会主义的改造，而且要很好地组织各种经济成份的工业的力量，在技术上和生产组织上进行适当的改造。在这个转变的过程中，不可能设想不会发生某些困难，遇到某些障碍。但是，困难和障碍是可以克服的。地方工业如果不积极地改造自己，将来遇到的困难和障碍就更大，就将使自己陷于更加被动的地位。
    克服困难和障碍的办法，河北省的经验可以作为借鉴。河北省地方工业的发展，虽然曾经一度走过一些弯路，但是当领导地方工业的人员了解到党和国家关于地方工业的方针的重要性以后，他们就坚决地为贯彻执行这个方针而斗争。他们对支援农村的社会主义革命运动，对改善农民的生活，有责任心，有积极性，因而在工作中就取得了一定的成绩。各省地方工业的领导部门，在贯彻执行党和国家的方针的时候，必须提高所属企业和所有人员的社会主义的责任心和积极性，使他们诚心诚意地为农村经济服务，为农民群众服务。
    为了服务于农村经济和农民群众，地方工业应该采取一些具体方法。例如，河北省地方工业组织农村访问，同农业生产合作社建立经常联系，吸取农民的实际经验来制造新产品，组织私营工业和手工业建立农具修配网，教给农民使用新式农具等等，就是很好的方法。当然，各个地方的工业企业，生产什么产品，生产多少，先从哪里下手，应该同当地的自然条件和资源条件、设备能力和技术水平，以及同当地农民的耕作习惯和生活习惯、农业的自然条件等等相适应。这样，就可以防止盲目性，加强计划性。
    现在全国各地正在开展农业合作化运动和制定农业生产的全面规划。各地的地方工业领导部门，必须注意结合这个规划，为地方工业的发展制定一个全面的长期的计划。在制定这个计划的过程中，应当注意考虑到以下几个问题：第一，一方面要着重地考虑到由于本地方农业合作化运动的大发展而对地方工业所提出的各种要求，考虑到由于本地方林业、牧畜业、渔业、手工业、副业等等的发展对地方工业所提出的各种要求，另一方面又要考虑到当地的资源条件、工业生产的设备能力、技术水平和地区的分布等问题，即根据需要和可能来确定地方工业的发展远景。第二，要使这个计划适应于全国平衡的要求，即解决本地方的工业同中央国营工业的分工协作问题。第三，要统一安排地方的国营工业、合作社营工业、公私合营工业、私营工业以及手工业的生产，使之互相配合，同时规划对私营工业和手工业的社会主义改造的步骤和具体进度。这样，各地方就可以正确地发挥本地方的经济的潜在力量，使地方工业的发展同当地农业合作化的发展在步骤上相适应。
    全国农业合作化运动的高潮已经来到了。地方工业部门的全体职工们，都应该积极地去迎接这个高潮，支援农业合作化；并且把地方工业本身的发展速度加快，质量提高，把地方工业中的社会主义力量大大地加强起来。
