    The First Sinking of No. 5 Pier Cofferdam of the Yangtze River Bridge Completed
    The first sinking of the cofferdam for the No. 5 pier of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge has been completed, and there are now four piers under simultaneous water construction on the vast Yangtze River.
    The No. 5 pier is located in the center of the river flow and relies entirely on power generation ships for power supply and on radio for communication with the shore. The cofferdam sinking began at 4:00 PM on October 30th. At that time, the river was calm. At the command from the command ship, eight electric winches started simultaneously, and the more than 100-ton steel cofferdam slowly sank. At night, the moonlight was bright and the water rippled. The silver light of the searchlights illuminated the water construction site. More than 100 bridge workers persisted in their work until 3:00 AM on the 31st, completing the first sinking.
    The sinking of the No. 5 cofferdam is being carried out during the overall construction of the Yangtze River Bridge. With the help of Soviet experts, a method was devised to use an overhead gantry crane on the water, allowing the three large crane ships that were previously used for sinking cofferdams to be used for other piers.
    The No. 5 cofferdam is divided into five layers, and the top three layers must be assembled in the middle of the river. The sinking work will also be carried out in several stages. The workers are now assembling the third layer of the cofferdam, preparing for the second sinking.

    长江大桥五号桥墩围囹首次下沉完毕
    武汉长江大桥五号桥墩的围囹第一次下沉完毕，辽阔的长江上有了四个桥墩同时进行水上施工。
    五号桥墩位于江流中心，全靠发电船供应电源，靠无线电和岸上联络。这次围囹下沉从十月三十日下午四时开始，当时江上风平浪静，指挥船上的号令一发，八部电动绞车同时开动，一百多吨的钢围囹便徐徐下沉。入夜，月光皎洁，水波鳞鳞，探照灯的银色的灯光照亮了水上工地，一百多名桥梁工人一直坚持工作到三十一日早晨三点，第一次下沉完毕。
    五号围囹下沉是在长江大桥全面施工中进行的。在苏联专家帮助下，设法采用水上塔架起重机，将以往下沉围囹所用的三部大吊船，让给其他桥墩使用。
    五号围囹共分五层，上面三层都要在江心中拼装，下沉工作也分数次进行。工人们现在正在拼装第三层围囹，准备第二次下沉。
