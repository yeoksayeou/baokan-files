Asian and African Countries Demand Normalization of International Trade
Feng Zhidan

Since the Asian-African Conference, the trend of Asian and African countries demanding to break away from imperialist economic control and develop economic cooperation with each other has grown significantly.

In the past half year, Asian and African countries have concluded many new trade agreements to further promote the development of trade relations between them. In addition to continuing to develop traditional and close trade relations with India, Burma has signed a new barter agreement with Indonesia. The Sino-Burmese trade agreement is being implemented smoothly. The signing of the trade agreement between Burma and the Soviet Union has found a stable market for Burmese rice exports. The trade agreements concluded between Egypt and China, and Egypt and the Soviet Union, have found broad foreign markets for Egyptian cotton. Recently, the Egyptian government also announced the establishment of a new company to develop trade relations between Egypt and Asian and African countries. Pakistan and Indonesia announced the continued extension of the trade agreement signed between the two countries in 1953. During this period, the total trade volume between China and India has greatly increased. According to the Indian Press, the total value of China's exports to India from November last year to August this year increased by three and a half times compared with the same period last year, and the total value of India's exports to China increased by nine times. Since China and Indonesia signed the protocol of the trade agreement and the payment agreement last September, the trade relations between the two countries have developed further. China and Japan signed the third trade agreement. China and Ceylon recently signed a rubber and rice trade contract for 1956. These new trade agreements and exchanges have further promoted the development of economic cooperation between Asian and African countries.

Trade between Asian and African countries is conducted on the basis of equal treatment and mutual benefit between the contracting parties. This is in line with the spirit of the Asian-African Conference resolution which calls for "economic cooperation on the basis of mutual benefit and mutual respect for national sovereignty."

However, there are still man-made obstacles in the path of Asian and African countries developing economic cooperation with each other.

As is well known, the "embargo" policy imposed by the United States on many Asian and African countries still seriously hinders the full development of normal economic cooperation relations between Asian and African countries. When the United Nations discussed the issue of developing international trade in underdeveloped countries, many Asian and African countries repeatedly expressed their desire for "independent economic development" and strengthening "economic cooperation" between Asian and African countries, and also supported the Soviet proposal on "abolishing trade discrimination measures."

People have seen that after the Asian-African Conference, parliamentarians from many parties in the Indonesian Parliament condemned the US "embargo" policy. In May of this year, Indonesian parliamentarians pointed out in a joint report on the tin agreement that the "embargo" caused instability in international tin prices, thereby harming tin-producing countries. In June, the Indonesian National Employers' Association issued a statement expressing its hope to expand economic ties with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other people's democratic countries. It is entirely understandable that Indonesia, which is rich in rubber and tin, urgently needs to lift the "embargo" so that its bulk products can find reasonable sales markets.

People have also seen that the US "embargo" policy is an intolerable restriction on Japan's development of foreign trade. Everyone knows that the development of the Japanese economy depends on the import of many important raw materials and the export of a large number of industrial products. However, because Sino-Japanese trade relations are blocked, Japan has no choice but to import high-priced raw materials from the distant United States on the one hand, and on the other hand, it is impossible to export a large number of industrial products needed by China. Therefore, Sino-Japanese trade, which originally accounted for a very large proportion of Japan's foreign trade, had fallen to a negligible proportion of about 1% by October 1954. In recent years, Japanese business and industry figures have signed trade agreements with China three times in order to break away from the "embargo", but the first two trade agreements were not fully implemented due to interference and restrictions from the "Paris Coordinating Committee". Whether the third Sino-Japanese trade agreement and a series of trade contracts recently signed in Beijing can be effectively implemented depends on whether the Japanese government can overcome this obstacle from Washington.

It is worth noting that the Washington ruling clique is currently exerting pressure on those Asian and African countries that are eager to get rid of the "embargo" and interfering in the development of normal trade relations in Asian and African countries. Not long ago, when US Deputy Secretary of State Hoover engaged in conspiracy activities in Tokyo, he publicly stated that the United States had no intention of "changing" the "embargo" policy that deprives other countries of their sovereignty.

Not only that, while forcing many countries to implement the "embargo", the United States also uses unequal treaties and agreements to force some Asian and African countries to undertake the obligation of engaging in unilateral trade with the United States, thereby plundering these countries. Under the cover of the "embargo" policy, the United States has adopted measures to monopolize and depress prices for Indonesia's exports of rubber and tin. The United States monopolizes almost all of Thailand's rubber exports. According to statistics from the Thai Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, during the one and a half years ending in June this year, the United States imported rubber from Thailand accounting for 99% of Thailand's total rubber exports. According to the Thai "Economy" bi-monthly, after the United States monopolized Thailand's tin exports, in March of this year, "after the expiration of the Thai-American tin trade agreement, the United States immediately put pressure on Thailand to reduce the price of tin by 30 US dollars per ton by stopping the renewal." The Philippines' foreign trade has also long been monopolized by the United States. The United States is also doing the same to Turkey. Since 1948, Turkey has been forced by the United States to participate in the "European Economic Cooperation Organization", and therefore has been under the control of this organization in foreign trade. After that, Turkey followed Washington's instructions and implemented "partial" customs duty exemptions on imported and exported goods, which greatly facilitated the dumping of American goods in the Turkish market.

Needless to say, this mandatory unilateral trade has brought increasingly serious economic consequences to these countries. In fiscal year 1954, the Philippines' trade deficit with the United States reached more than 160 million pesos, more than six times higher than in 1950. Thailand's continuous trade deficit has caused Thailand's foreign exchange reserves to dwindle in recent years. According to United Nations statistics, Thailand's foreign exchange reserves were 221 million US dollars in 1952, and had decreased to 144 million US dollars by last October. The situation in Turkey in this regard is even worse. According to the Associated Press on September 30, Turkey's trade deficit in the first six months of this year has reached more than 110 million US dollars, an increase of 19 million US dollars over the same period last year. Similarly, due to the United States' forced unilateral trade with Japan, Japan's foreign trade has also experienced a serious crisis. In the eight years from 1946 to 1953, the trade deficit between Japan and the United States reached 3.4 billion US dollars. In 1954, Japan's trade deficit reached 770 million US dollars, of which the trade deficit with the United States accounted for 570 million US dollars.

In order to shift the crisis of overproduction in its domestic agriculture, the US monopoly forces are stepping up the dumping of large quantities of surplus agricultural products in the Asian market through means such as "aid." In May of this year, representatives of the Burmese federal government strongly opposed the US plan to dump rice. The Bangkok "Cao Thai Newspaper" also believes that the US "competition" in the rice market is having a disastrous impact on the Thai economy. Thai Minister of Agriculture Nai Ping Chunhawan expressed legitimate concerns about the US rice dumping policy when he met with US agricultural officials on October 3. Obviously, the US practice of dumping surplus agricultural products in Asian and African countries is unpopular. At the end of June this year, even the Philippine government rejected the US proposal to dump 22.2 million US dollars worth of surplus agricultural products in the Philippines.

It can be seen from this that the US "embargo" and trade monopoly policies have damaged the economic interests of Asian and African countries. The influential Japanese bourgeois newspaper "Mainichi Shimbun" stated in an editorial on October 7 that developing trade relations between China and Japan would be "one of the most effective ways" to solve Japan's economic difficulties. The "Pakistan Times" on October 8 also called for the signing of a trade agreement between China and Pakistan. An editorial in the "Siam Masses Daily" on September 8 also advocated that Thailand should establish direct trade relations with China. It can be said that the call for abolishing the US "embargo" policy and breaking through the US trade monopoly chain is now rising higher and higher.

There is no doubt that eliminating obstacles to economic cooperation in Asian and African countries is a matter of immediate economic interest for every Asian and African country, and requires the joint efforts of Asian and African countries to break through these obstacles in order to promote the free development of normal economic relations and trade relations between Asian and African countries.

    亚非各国要求国际贸易正常化
    冯之丹
    亚非会议之后，亚非各国要求摆脱帝国主义的经济控制，发展彼此间经济合作的趋势，有了明显的增长。
    近半年来，亚非各国为促进彼此间贸易关系的进一步发展，又缔结了许多新的贸易协定。缅甸除了继续同印度发展着传统的、密切的贸易关系外，同印度尼西亚签订了新的换货协定。中缅贸易协定正在顺利地执行。缅甸、苏联两国贸易协定的签订，给缅甸大米的出口找到了稳固的市场。埃及和中国、埃及和苏联缔结的贸易协定，为埃及的棉花找到了广阔的国外市场。最近，埃及政府还宣布成立一个新公司以发展埃及和亚非国家间的贸易关系。巴基斯坦和印度尼西亚宣布了继续延长一九五三年两国之间签订的贸易协定。这一期间，中国和印度的贸易总额有了大大的增加，据印度新闻处报道，从去年十一月到今年八月的十个月当中，中国对印度的输出总值比上一年度同一时期增加了三倍半，印度对中国的输出总值增加了九倍。中国和印度尼西亚之间的贸易关系，自去年九月两国签订了贸易协定议定书及支付协定以后，又有了新的发展。中国和日本之间签订了第三次贸易协定。中国和锡兰最近签订了一九五六年的橡胶及大米贸易合同。这些新的贸易协定和交往，进一步地促进了亚非国家经济合作的发展。
    亚非国家之间的贸易往来，是在缔约双方平等相待和互利的基础上进行的。这同亚非会议决议所指出的“在互利和互相尊重国家主权的基础上实行经济合作”的精神是一致的。
    但是，在亚非国家发展彼此间经济合作的道路上，还存在着人为的障碍。
    如所周知，美国所强加在许多亚非国家头上的
  “禁运”政策仍然严重地障碍着亚非国家间正常经济合作关系的充分发展。在联合国内讨论落后国家开展国际贸易问题时，不少亚非国家曾一再表示要求“本国独立的经济发展”和加强亚非国家“经济合作”的愿望，并且还支持了苏联关于“取消贸易歧视措施”的建议。
    人们看到，在亚非会议后，印度尼西亚国会中许多党派的议员曾谴责了美国的“禁运”政策。今年五月间印度尼西亚国会议员在关于锡业协定的联合报告中就指出，“禁运”造成了国际锡价的不稳定状态，因而给产锡国家带来损害。六月间，印度尼西亚全国企业联合会发表声明表示希望扩大同苏联、中华人民共和国和其他人民民主国家的经济联系。盛产橡胶和锡的印度尼西亚亟需取消“禁运”，以使它的大宗产品找到合理的销售市场，这是完全可以理解的。
    人们也看到，美国的“禁运”政策是对日本发展对外贸易的一个不能容忍的束缚。谁都知道，日本经济的发展有赖于许多重要原料的进口及大量工业品的输出。但是由于中日贸易关系受到阻塞，日本不能不一方面从遥远的美国进口高价的原料，另一方面又不可能大量输出为中国所需要的工业品。因此，本来在日本对外贸易中占极大比重的中日贸易，到一九五四年十月已下降到百分之一左右的微不足道的比重了。近几年来，日本工商企业界人士为摆脱“禁运”曾三次同中国方面签订了贸易协定，但是头两次贸易协定由于日本方面受到“巴黎统筹委员会”的干涉和限制未能充分执行。而现在第三次中日贸易协定以及最近在北京签订的一系列贸易合同能否切实执行，还要取决于日本政府是否能够克服来自华盛顿的这种障碍。
    值得注意的是：华盛顿统治集团目前正在对于那些亟欲摆脱“禁运”的亚非国家施加压力，干涉亚非各国的正常贸易关系的发展。不久前，美国副国务卿胡佛到东京进行阴谋活动时还公开表示美国无意于“改变”剥夺它国主权的“禁运”政策。
    不仅如此，美国在强迫许多国家实行“禁运”的同时，还利用不平等的条约和协定，强制一些亚非国家承担同美国进行片面贸易的义务，从而对这些国家进行掠夺。美国在“禁运”政策的掩护下，对印度尼西亚的橡胶和锡的出口采取了垄断和压低价格的措施。美国垄断着几乎全部泰国的橡胶输出。据泰国农林部的统计数字，到今年六月截止的一年半期间，美国从泰国输入的树胶占泰国树胶出口总额的百分之九十九。据泰国“经济”半月刊说，美国在垄断了泰国锡的出口以后，在今年三月“泰美锡贸易协定满期后，美国即以停止续订的办法向泰国施加压力，要泰国削减锡价每吨三十美元”。菲律宾的对外贸易长期以来也为美国所垄断。美国对土耳其也是如此。土耳其在一九四八年以后便在美国强迫下参加“欧洲经济合作组织”，因而在对外贸易上就一直受着这个组织的控制。在这以后，土耳其又遵照华盛顿的意旨，对进出口货物实行了“部分的”海关免税，给美国货在土耳其市场上的倾销大开方便之门。
    不消说，这种强制性的片面贸易给这些国家带来了越来越严重的经济恶果。一九五四年度菲律宾对美贸易的入超达一亿六千多万比索，比一九五○年增加了六倍多。泰国对外贸易不断入超已使泰国近年来的外汇储备日形枯竭。据联合国的统计，一九五二年泰国的外汇储备为二亿二千一百万美元，到去年十月已减少到一亿四千四百万美元。土耳其在这方面的情况就更加恶劣。据美联社九月三十日说，土耳其在今年头六个月中的贸易赤字已经达到一亿一千多万美元，比去年同期增加了一千九百万美元。同样，由于美国强制日本进行片面贸易的结果，日本的对外贸易也发生了严重的危机。从一九四六年至一九五三年的八年中，日美之间的贸易逆差已达到三十四亿美元。一九五四年日本贸易赤字达到七亿七千万美元，其中对美贸易的入超就占到五亿七千万美元。
    美国垄断势力更为了转嫁它国内农业生产过剩的危机，加紧把大量的剩余农产品通过“援助”等等的手段倾销于亚洲市场。今年五月间，缅甸联邦政府代表曾激烈地反对美国倾销大米的计划，曼谷“操泰报”也认为美国在大米市场上的“竞争”正在对泰国经济起着灾难性的影响。泰国农业部长乃屏·春哈旺在十月三日接见美国农业官员时对于美国的倾销大米政策表示了正当的忧虑。显然，美国在亚非国家倾销剩余农产品的作法是不受欢迎的，今年六月底，甚至菲律宾政府也拒绝了美国在菲律宾倾销价值二千二百万美元剩余农产品的建议。
    由此可见，美国的“禁运”和贸易垄断政策，损害了亚非国家的经济利益。日本有影响的资产阶级报纸“每日新闻”在十月七日的社论中就认为，发展中日两国之间的贸易联系，将是解决日本经济困难的“最有效的方法之一”。十月八日的“巴基斯坦时报”也要求中巴签订贸易协定。九月八日“暹罗群众报”的社论也主张泰国应该同中国建立直接的贸易联系。可以说，主张废除美国“禁运”政策和冲破美国的贸易垄断锁链的呼声现在是越来越高涨了。
    毫无疑问，消除亚非国家经济合作的障碍，是有关每一个亚非国家切身经济利益的问题，需要亚非各国共同努力来打破这种障碍，以促进亚非国家间正常经济关系和贸易关系的自由发展。
