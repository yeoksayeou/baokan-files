    The festive parade on Red Square had barely ended when dusk quickly approached in Moscow, nearing early winter. Festive lights immediately shone brilliantly, turning Moscow into a city of all-night revelry.

    The people celebrating the festival forgot the fatigue of the daytime parade and gradually thronged to Red Square and the nearby streets. People on Red Square sang, danced, and constantly cheered.

    Art Theatre Street and Gorky Street, usually bustling with traffic, were devoid of the noise of vehicles. Everywhere was a crowd of people indulging in joy. Sometimes, hand-in-hand, the crowds almost blocked roads more than ten yards wide; these were young workers from factories. Their steps were almost uniform, and a lively tune sounded from the accordion.

    The colored lights on the Central Telegraph Office building were constantly changing in a myriad of ways. The colored light patterns of hydropower stations, steel plants, and railways flickered. The words "Overfulfilled the Fifth Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule" and "Welcome the 20th Party Congress" alternated in brilliance.

    The newly built twenty-two-story building on Uprising Square was adorned with festive lights and decorations for the first time. More than one million square meters of new housing were completed in Moscow this year. Many Muscovites held housewarming banquets during this joyous festival.

    The lights of various high-rise buildings along the Moscow River formed a continuous line, illuminating the Moscow River especially brightly at night. On the Crimean Bridge, one could see the red star of the Kremlin soaring into the clouds above a sea of festive lights, and on the other side, one could see the white buildings of Moscow University in the distance, crystal clear, as beautiful as in a fairy tale.

    Everywhere was a vast crowd, and the subway had to stop transporting passengers to the city center.

    Art performances began in various districts of the city. Tonight, Moscow displayed the charm of its art and music. On the squares and streets of the fifteen districts, the celebration performances included sixty teams of actors from various theaters and more than eight thousand members of amateur art groups. The Manege Square was packed with people, all listening to moving songs. Performing here were the folk song choir and folk instrument ensemble of the Central Club of Railway Workers. Actors from the Operetta Theater and the Drama Theater performed in five locations in the Kalinin District. The city's cultural palaces and clubs were brightly lit and packed with people who came to celebrate the festival. The lucky audience members who obtained seats enjoyed new plays such as "Brave" and "The First Spring," which depicted the labor achievements of the Soviet people.

    Many friends from foreign countries and students from various People's Democratic countries studying in Moscow were invited to dance and sing with the Soviet people in the clubs to celebrate the great revolutionary festival. Wherever they went, they became the center of welcome and attention.

    Festive salutes thundered within the walls of the Kremlin. Many searchlight beams and colorful fireworks shot from the city center into the sky. With each salute, a transparent beam of light quickly swept across the sky. At this moment, people looked up to appreciate the most beautiful moment in this festive life. People climbed to the top of twenty or thirty-story buildings, and many people even came to Lenin Hills specifically to overlook the festive night view of Moscow, shrouded in countless flowers.

    As the night deepened, the crowded streets slowly became less crowded. At this time, the windows of the buildings and residences shone even brighter. Academicians, scholars, ordinary workers, and model laborers were in their own or their relatives' warm homes, raising their glasses to bless this revolutionary festival that had opened up a bright future for them, to bless relatives and friends far from Moscow, to bless future better work, and to welcome the early arrival of communism.

    莫斯科十月革命节欢乐之夜
    新华社驻莫斯科记者　李楠
    红场上节日游行结束不久，莫斯科临近初冬的天色很快就到向晚时分了。节日的灯火立刻辉煌灿烂起来，莫斯科成了一座通夜欢乐的城市。
    庆祝节日的人们忘却了白天游行的疲劳，又渐渐地拥到了红场和附近的街道。红场上的人们载歌载舞，不断发出欢呼的声音。
    平时车如流水的艺术剧院街、高尔基大街上消失了车辆的喧声。到处是尽情欢乐的人群。有时手牵着手的人群几乎把十多丈宽的道路都拦断了，这是工厂里的青年工人。他们的步伐几乎是整齐一致的，手风琴响起了轻快的曲调。
    中央电报局大楼的灯彩不停地千变万化。水电站、炼钢厂、铁道等灯彩图案闪闪烁烁。“提前完成了第五个五年计划”和“迎接第二十次党代表大会”的字样交替辉耀着。
    起义广场新建成的二十二层高楼第一次披上了节日的灯火和彩饰。莫斯科今年内新落成的住宅共有一百多万平方公尺。许多莫斯科人在这喜气洋溢的节日里举行了新居宴会。
    沿莫斯科河的各个高楼大厦的灯光连成一片，把入夜的莫斯科河也照得分外明亮。在克里米亚桥上，一边可以看到克里姆林宫的红星在一片节日灯火上高擎入云，一边可以望见在远处的莫斯科大学的白色建筑物，晶莹剔透，仿佛在神仙故事中一般的美丽。
    到处都是浩荡的人群，地下电车也得停止再向市中心区载运乘客了。
    市内各区的艺术表演开始了。今夜的莫斯科显示出了她所拥有的艺术和音乐的魅力。十五个区的广场和街道上，参加庆祝演出的有六十队各个剧院的演员和八千多个业余艺术团体的人员。练马场上人头攒动，大家都在倾听动人的歌曲。在这里表演的是铁路员工中央俱乐部的民歌合唱团和民间乐器演奏团。轻歌剧院和话剧院的演员们在加里宁区分成五处表演。全市的文化宫和俱乐部灯火通明，挤满了前来欢度佳节的人群。幸运获得了座位的观众们在剧院里欣赏“勇敢”、“第一个春天”等描写苏联人民劳动功绩的新剧。
    许多从外国来的朋友们以及在莫斯科学习的各人民民主国家的学生都被邀请在俱乐部内，和苏联人民一道跳舞唱歌，欢度伟大的革命节日。他们每到一处，都成为大家欢迎和注意的中心。
    节日的礼炮在克里姆林宫墙内轰鸣起来了。从城市中心射出来的许多探照灯的光柱和鲜艳的礼花一道射向空际。每一声礼炮响起，透明的光柱便迅疾地扫过天空。这时，人们都在抬起头来，欣赏这节日生活中最美好的时刻。人们登上二三十层的高楼，许多人群甚至特地来到列宁山上，俯瞰这无数花朵笼罩的莫斯科的节日夜景。
    夜深了，街道上拥挤的人群慢慢显得稀少了。这时各个高楼大厦住宅的窗户内更放光明。院士们、学者们、普通工人和劳动模范们正在自己或亲友的温暖的家里，举杯祝福这个给他们开辟了美好前途的革命佳节，祝福远离莫斯科的亲人和朋友，祝福未来的更好的工作，迎接共产主义的早日降临。
