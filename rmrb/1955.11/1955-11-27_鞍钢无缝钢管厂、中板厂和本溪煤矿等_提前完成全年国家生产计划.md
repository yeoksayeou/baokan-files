　　Pre-fulfill Annual National Production Plans

　　(Reported by this newspaper) The Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Seamless Steel Tube Plant and Medium Plate Plant have both pre-fulfilled their production plans for this year. In this year's production, all employees of the Seamless Steel Tube Plant launched an in-depth labor competition, increasing the output and quality of seamless steel tubes. On November 24th, they pre-fulfilled this year's national plan by thirty-seven days. The quality of the products also exceeded the national targets. The cost was 5.67 percent lower than planned. In the eleven months, with the help of Soviet experts, the workers also successfully trial-produced twelve new products of various specifications.

　　On November 22nd, the Anshan Iron and Steel Medium Plate Plant comprehensively over-fulfilled the 1955 national plan by thirty-nine days and sixteen hours. The completion of various annual plan targets is as follows: 100% of output, 100% of variety orders, quality - first-class product rate of 94.85% (plan 87.6%), and 679,000 yuan was saved in addition to completing the cost plan. Labor productivity had already been pre-fulfilled by the end of October.

　　Now, inspired by new fighting goals, the employees of the Medium Plate Plant continue to work hard. They guarantee to increase the production of steel plates for the country by 15.7% of the annual plan by the end of the year, and save another 150,000 yuan of wealth.

　　(Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 26th) On November 23rd, the Benxi Coal Mine pre-fulfilled the annual coal mining plan by one month and seven days; then on the 25th, it pre-fulfilled the annual tunneling plan by one month and five days, preparing for coal mining in the first six months of next year. The average production cost per ton of coal in the entire mine was 7.7% lower than planned, and labor productivity also exceeded the national plan targets, with each person producing 14 tons more of coking coal for the country.

　　Since January of this year, the Benxi Coal Mine has implemented comprehensive production reform. In the second half of the year, it promoted the advanced experience of "Regular Cyclic Operation" from Fuxin Ping'an No. 1 Mine in most coal mining faces to establish a normal production order. In the tunneling faces, the advanced experience of Fuxin Li Baoshu's rapid tunneling team was organized and promoted, and the workers' production capacity was fully utilized. Currently, all workers in the Benxi Coal Mine are striving to produce another 148,000 tons of coking coal by the end of the year.

　　(Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 26th) Employees of the local state-owned Xinjiang Cement Plant pre-fulfilled this year's production plan by one and a half months. All employees of the plant proposed to increase cement production by 1,800 tons for the country in the last month and a half of this year.

　　This year, in production, the employees of the Xinjiang Cement Plant learned advanced operation methods such as "full wind, fast feed, diligent feeding, and diligent discharge" from the Yunnan Cement Plant, and overhauled Kiln No. 2 according to the principle of improving the production capacity of automatic vertical kilns published in the Soviet "Cement Magazine." Therefore, in the second half of this year, they shortened the loading and unloading time, and improved the output and quality of clinker. The cost per ton of cement was also 13.51% lower than originally planned.

　　(Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 26th) Tianjin Yongming Paint Industry Company, a joint state-private enterprise famous for producing high-grade paints, completed this year's total production value plan on the 23rd. The annual output plan and savings plan have already been over-fulfilled in October.

　　Since the implementation of joint state-private ownership in 1953, Yongming Paint Industry Company has over-fulfilled its production plan every year, and the quality of various paints has improved. In 1952, this company only produced nineteen kinds of paint, but by this year it has increased to twenty-five kinds, and has also successfully trial-produced dozens of new products. Most of these new products are high-grade paints with acid resistance, heat resistance, and corrosion resistance used in basic construction and heavy industrial production.

　　After the enterprise was jointly operated, the company's employees worked hard to improve technology, and actively adopted substitutes in the production increase and savings competition, and established systems such as quota-based material requisition in the workshop, which reduced waste in raw materials and enterprise management costs, so that the production cost was much lower than before the joint operation.

　　鞍钢无缝钢管厂、中板厂和本溪煤矿等
　　提前完成全年国家生产计划
    本报讯　鞍山钢铁公司无缝钢管厂和中板厂都提前完成今年生产计划。无缝钢管厂全体职工，在今年的生产中，深入开展了劳动竞赛，提高了无缝钢管的产量和质量，在十一月二十四日提前三十七天完成了今年国家计划。产品的质量也超过了国家规定的指标。成本比计划降低了百分之五点六七。在十一个月当中，职工们在苏联专家帮助下，还试制成功了十二种规格的新产品。
    鞍钢中板厂在十一月二十二日提前三十九天零十六小时全面超额完成了一九五五年度国家计划。各项年度计划指标的完成情况是：产量百分之百，品种定货百分之百，质量——一级品率百分之九十四点八五（计划百分之八十七点六），在完成成本计划之外又节约了六十七万九千元，劳动生产率在十月底便已提前完成。
    现在中板厂职工们在新的奋斗目标鼓舞下，继续紧张地劳动着。他们保证到年底再给国家增产相当于年计划百分之十五点七的钢板，再节约十五万元的财富。
    本报沈阳二十六日电　本溪煤矿在十一月二十三日提前一个月零七天完成全年采煤计划；接着又在二十五日提前一个月零五天完成全年掘进计划，为明年头六个月采煤做好准备。全矿平均每吨煤的生产成本比计划降低百分之七点七，劳动生产率也超过国家计划指标，每人多给国家生产十四吨炼焦煤。
    从今年一月开始，本溪煤矿实行了全面生产改革。下半年又在大部分采煤掌子推广了阜新平安一坑“正规循环作业”先进经验，建立生产的正常秩序；在掘进掌子里，组织推广阜新李宝书快速掘进队的先进经验，工人的生产能力得到充分发挥。目前本溪煤矿全矿工人，正在为到年底再增产十四万八千吨炼焦煤而奋斗。
    新华社乌鲁木齐二十六日电　地方国营新疆水泥厂的职工提前一个半月完成了今年的生产计划。全厂职工提出要在今年最后一个半月内再为国家增产一千八百吨水泥。
    新疆水泥厂的职工今年在生产中，学习了云南水泥厂“全风快料、勤加勤出”等先进操作方法，并且根据苏联“水泥杂志”上登载的提高自动式立窑生产能力的原理检修了二号立窑。因而，他们在今年下半年缩短了加料和出料的时间，提高了熟料的产量和质量。每吨水泥的成本也比原计划降低了百分之十三点五一。
    新华社天津二十六日电　以生产高级漆著名的天津市公私合营永明油漆工业公司，在二十三日完成了今年的生产总值计划。全年的产量计划和节约计划都已经在十月份超额完成。
    永明油漆工业公司自一九五三年实行公私合营以来，每年都超额完成了生产计划，各种油漆的质量都有提高。一九五二年，这个公司只生产十九种油漆，到今年已经增加到二十五种，还试制成功几十种新产品。这些新产品大部分是基本建设和重工业生产上使用的具有耐酸、耐热和防腐性的高级漆。
    公司的职工在企业合营后，努力改进了技术，并且在增产节约竞赛中积极采用代用品，建立车间限额领料等制度，减少了原材料和企业管理费用上的浪费，使生产成本比合营以前降低了很多。
