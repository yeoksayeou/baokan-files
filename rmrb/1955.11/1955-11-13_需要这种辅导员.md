We Need This Kind of Counselor

　　Not long ago, when Yuci County, Shanxi Province, was training 120 new cooperative leaders who had already set up their frameworks, it hired 21 old cooperative chairmen to serve as counselors for the training class. With their guidance, the Party's collectivization principles, policies, and methods taught by the instructors were not only easier for the students to understand, but also the cooperative management experience they imparted was easily accepted by the students. Therefore, everyone generally reflected: this training had both theory and practice, and they were guaranteed to succeed in whatever they did when they returned.

　　Hiring old cooperative chairmen as counselors for the new cooperative cadre training class has many benefits: it can solve the problem of insufficient leadership in the training class; it can improve the teaching quality of the training class; and it can enhance the sense of responsibility of the old cooperatives to help the new cooperatives.

　　Old cooperatives can do many things to promote the agricultural cooperation movement. In the work of training cadres, we must not forget their role.

　　需要这种辅导员
    不久以前，山西省榆次县在训练已经搭起架子的一百二十个新社领导骨干的时候，聘请了二十一个老社社长，担任训练班的辅导员。经过他们的辅导，不但教员讲授的党的合作化方针、政策和办法，学员们比较容易领会，而且他们传授的办社经验，也容易被学员们接受。因此大家普遍反映：这次训练，道理有道理，实际有实际，回去要保证办一个成一个。
    聘请老社社长作新社骨干训练班的辅导员有很多好处：可以解决训练班领导力量不足的问题；可以提高训练班的教学质量，可以增强老社帮助新社的责任感。
    为了推动农业合作化运动，老社可以作很多事情。在训练干部的工作中，也不能忘了他们的作用。
