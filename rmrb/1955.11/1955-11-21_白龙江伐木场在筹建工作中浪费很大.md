　　Bailongjiang Logging Yard Wastes Greatly During Preparatory Work
    To the Editor:
    The preparatory office of the Bailongjiang Logging Yard was established in 1952 under the leadership of the former Northwest Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. According to the original plan, the logging yard would begin capital construction in 1953 and start production in 1955. However, due to their lack of necessary understanding of forest area resources and inadequate planning, capital construction work was forced to stop several times, and even now, the preparatory work is still at a loss.
    In the beginning, the site of this logging yard was decided to be built in Wudu City. The preparatory office bought land in Wudu and stored a large number of materials. Then, because the plan was to build more than 280 kilometers of forest railway, and Liangshui Town, more than 30 miles away from Wudu City, was planned as a large station, it was decided to move the site to Liangshui Town, and the materials stored in Wudu had to be moved along with it. Later, it was discovered that the conditions for building the railway were insufficient, and it was decided to use the river water of the Bailongjiang River to transport timber instead (which is reasonable). Such changes in plans caused a lot of waste in manpower and materials.
    The construction of forest roads was also not comprehensively planned. The survey and design work was not complete, so construction was blindly carried out, so that it was only discovered halfway through the project that the supply of materials and the daily necessities of the workers could not be met, and roads were quickly built. What is strange is that the grade of roads to be built? How wide the road surface should be to meet current and future needs? These questions were not seriously considered before construction.
    By the end of December 1954, the scrapped project losses of this preparatory office amounted to 277,309 yuan, the preparatory expenses written off were 200,5407 yuan, and the materials in stock were 79,946 yuan.
    Now, although the Ministry of Forestry has stopped the capital construction work of the Bailongjiang Logging Yard and is conducting overall design first, the problem of workers being idle has not been resolved, and waste continues to exist. For example, the "Forest Re-survey Team" of more than 120 people only worked for less than four months this year. If calculated at an average monthly salary of 50 yuan per person, a total of 54,000 yuan will be wasted in nine months. The workers remaining in the logging yard are also in the same situation of having many people and little work.
    I suggest that the preparatory office of the Bailongjiang Logging Yard conduct a thorough rectification. Since the main task of this logging yard in the next year or two is only survey and design work, why not resettle the surplus workers properly as soon as possible?

### 白龙江伐木场在筹建工作中浪费很大
呼延奋武

　　白龙江伐木场在筹建工作中浪费很大编辑同志：
    白龙江伐木场筹备处是一九五二年在原西北农林部的领导下成立的。按照原计划，伐木场从一九五三年开始进行基本建设，一九五五年就要开始生产。但是，由于他们对林区资源缺乏必要的了解，计划不周，基本建设工作几次被迫停工，一直到现在，筹备工作还毫无头绪。
    开始的时候，这个伐木场的场址决定建在武都市。筹备处就在武都买了地，并且储存了大批材料。接着，因为计划要修二百八十多公里的森林铁路，距离武都市三十多里的两水镇在计划中是一个大车站，所以又决定把场址移到两水镇，存放在武都的材料也只好跟着搬家。后来，发觉修铁路的条件不够，又决定了改用白龙江的江水运输木材（这是合理的）。这样计划一变再变，造成了人力、物力上的许多浪费。
    对于修建林道的工程，也同样没有全面计划，勘测设计工作还不完备，就盲目施工，以致工程进行到中途才发现材料和职工的生活用品供应不上，又赶紧修公路。奇怪的是，究竟要修几级公路？路面多宽才能满足目前和将来的需要？这些问题在施工以前，都没有认真考虑。
    到一九五四年十二月底，这个筹备处报废了的工程损失达二十七万七千三百零九元，报销了筹备费二十万零五千四百零七元，积压材料七万九千九百四十六元。
    现在，林业部虽然已经停止了白龙江伐木场的基本建设工作，先进行总体设计，但是因为工人窝工的问题并没有解决，浪费现象还继续存在着。例如，有一百二十多人的“森林复查队”，今年只做了不到四个月的工作。如果以每人每月平均工资五十元计算，九个月共浪费五万四千元。留在伐木场的工人同样是人多事少。
    我建议白龙江伐木场筹备处进行一次彻底整顿。既然在最近一、两年内，这个伐木场的主要任务只是勘测设计工作，为什么不及早地把多余的工人加以妥善安置呢？
                                  呼延奋武
