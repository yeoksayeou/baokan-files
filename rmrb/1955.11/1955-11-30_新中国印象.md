　　Impressions of New China
　　by Daboli Banduoer, Reporter for the Hungarian "Free People's Daily"
    If someone had planned to travel from Hungary to China fifteen years ago, they would of course need to travel the same distance as now. However, distance can no longer accurately express the gap, but rather "measures" such as feelings, sentiments, and thoughts are taking effect.

    Fifteen years ago, China was a very distant and unfamiliar country to us. Now, if I walk on the streets of Budapest, I can see the names of Chinese films on movie theater billboards. If I buy a newly published newspaper from a news vendor, I can see the achievements of workers in Beijing, Anshan, and Shanghai in the newspaper; in various department stores, I can choose many goods with Chinese trademarks.

    These are just small things in daily life. But, more important than these is that our people have a desire to learn more about China in detail. I think it is enough to mention just one thing here: not long ago, readers wrote to our editorial department asking us to report on some things about China, some even asking specific questions. For example: what is China's largest construction project, when and under what circumstances did the 25,000-li Long March take place, and so on.

    Do you think anyone can say for sure that the distance between our two countries can only be expressed by geographical measures? No, if it was right to say that China and Hungary were far apart in the past, then the opposite is true now.

    When our plane landed at Beijing Airport, we undoubtedly arrived in a country with different customs and habits from our own. The style of the houses here is different from ours, and the appearance of the cities and villages is also different, even eating is not like us, drinking soup first but last. But this is just our initial impression. A few hours or days later, I discovered that what is more important is that our motherland and China have common characteristics, that is, the common characteristics of people building socialism.

    If someone asks me what my deepest feeling in China is, I would answer without hesitation: in a country far away from us, we walk around like members of a family. Although it is a pity that I don't speak Chinese, I know the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism, and based on these, I can understand and comprehend Chinese life. The source of the Chinese people's remarkable achievements comes from this Marxist-Leninist worldview, and the efforts to build the country that initially moved foreign guests also originate from this.

    When visiting the Great Wall, I thought, this magnificent building was built by people under the whip more than two thousand years ago! When the descendants of those who built the Great Wall have the freedom to build for themselves, what great achievements can they achieve!

    After visiting the Great Wall, I visited several cities in this country and had the opportunity to see the results of the various works of the heroic Chinese people. Six years is just an instant compared to China's thousands of years of history. But in this instant, China's face has changed greatly. It is almost impossible to find appropriate words to express the feelings I had when visiting the cities and factories in the Northeast. In the places completely destroyed and plundered by the former Japanese imperialists and Kuomintang reactionaries, large-scale construction is now underway. The few hours spent visiting the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant under construction are something I will never forget in my life. This visit was very educational and memorable for me. This huge factory only started construction a few years ago, and today construction work is already underway in huge modern workshops on the land that was originally a flat grassland. Factory buildings with an area of 1.5 million square meters, where 7,000 machines are to be installed, residential areas with an area of 400,000 square meters... These figures reflect the great creative power of the Chinese people, reflecting the endless desire to work that the people's revolution has inspired among the working people.

    The Chinese people have many good qualities, qualities that have been formed for a long time and are only now beginning to be fully developed. The efforts of the Chinese people are also manifested in the exemplary cultivation of countless small pieces of land. The dexterity of the Chinese people's hands is well known in the world, and the rich and colorful ancient art and calligraphy based on painting talent also demonstrate this. I have only now discovered how significant such a nature of the people can be once it is connected with freedom! The efforts of the people can not only cultivate a small piece of land, but also manage huge collective farms, and build large-scale factories and cities. The dexterity of the hands is now not only needed for the best sculptures and paintings, but also for sophisticated instruments, lathes, and electrical equipment.

    Having the opportunity to meet and talk with Chinese workers is a special pleasure for me. To be honest, I want to study and study what exactly caused the people to win historically significant victories and liberate this vast country.

    After talking and getting to know each other, I found that the reason for this victory is first of all the people's infinite love for the Party and the country.

    A female worker from the Beijing No. 2 State-owned Cotton Textile Factory said:

      "My life before liberation can basically not be regarded as life. Since childhood, I have worked in the textile factories of Shanghai capitalists, and my salary was not enough for me to eat enough. I worked 18 hours a day, and my monthly salary was only equal to 17 kilograms of rice. After liberation, I got a new house, work 8 hours a day, and my monthly salary is equal to 250 kilograms of rice. More importantly, the Party pointed out the purpose of life for me, which is to fight for socialism. All this is thanks to Chairman Mao."

    I talked with five young people in Harbin, and they suggested organizing a youth reclamation team to reclaim wasteland in Heilongjiang Province.

      "We thank the Party, thank Chairman Mao. The present and future of young people are no longer poor and without prospects." A young worker said: "We know that our country needs more food, so we are very happy to reclaim wasteland."

    Let me introduce a touching thing to my readers. In the old workers' residence in Fushun, there is an older coal miner who has retired. He said to me:

      "'I have no home!' Not long ago I thought so, but this sentence is no longer correct. My family is now taken care of by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao!"

    Based on a few books, my knowledge of China before liberation can generally be said that people know that the poverty of the people is the very bad result of semi-colonial oppression. Now, I am so happy to see the Chinese people's increasingly better life! In Harbin, in Changchun, in Fushun, in other places, we visited newly built houses—buildings, visited newly established districts in the city. These places all have completely newly built health institutions, institutions for protecting mothers and children, libraries, and theaters. Although it has been only a short six years, if the Party points out the path and goals to the people, then the people can achieve great achievements.

    One of the characteristics of the reporter profession is to know a lot of things that are usually difficult to discover from many small things. For example, when visiting a rural area near Shenyang, I went to a rural store, and the people in the store said: Last month, the farmers bought 24 gold pens here. This shows that the cultural level of the rural areas has improved a lot. On the one hand, it shows that the farmers have the money to buy gold pens, and on the other hand, it shows that most of the rural population has learned to read and write and needs to buy pens.

    Countless feelings are pouring down my pen. Finally, I also plan to record one thing: I arrived in Beijing before October 1st, just preparing to celebrate this festival. There are many foreigners in the capital. I encountered a very good luck, as if I had received a medal, that is, I had the opportunity to participate in Comrade Zhou Enlai's reception. The reception was held in a brightly lit hall. In this hall, it seemed that all countries on the five continents were represented, including many famous peace fighters, politicians, scholars, writers, and businessmen, who had different beliefs and viewpoints. Beijing has shown the demeanor of a capital of a great country. Beijing is the capital of a great and prestigious country in the peace camp led by the Soviet Union today. It is unimaginable to solve any important international issue without the participation of this country. Beijing also shows that it is the capital of a country fighting for peace. Because the idea of peace has a common foundation, representatives of more than 50 countries gathered in the capital of China. On the international political stage, some people, like the characters in Shedrin's famous novel, say: The People's Republic of China does not exist. These imperialists confuse their agent Chiang Kai-shek with the Chinese people, with this great country. But the fact is the fact, and these guys cannot obliterate, and will eventually have to admit, this fact that makes them very distressed, that is, the People's Republic of China not only exists, but is also rapidly moving forward and growing stronger, and it has become one of the countries standing at the forefront of the world.

    Before ending this article, I would like to add a few words: We, the Hungarians, are very happy because we can say that we are friends of such a powerful and strong Chinese people. I repeat: a few thousand kilometers between our two countries is nothing. Our friendship will not be alienated because of the distance of several thousand kilometers, but will be strengthened day by day.

　　新中国印象
　　匈牙利“自由人民报”记者　达波里·班道尔
    假如有一个人在十五年以前打算从匈牙利到中国来游览，他当然需要经过同现在一样多的路程。但是，现在，里数已不能恰当地表示距离了，而像心意、感觉、思想等这样的“量度”，倒反而起作用了。
    在十五年以前，对我们来说，中国是一个非常遥远和陌生的国家。现在，假如我散步在布达佩斯的大街上，我可以在电影院的广告牌上看到中国影片的名字。假如我向报贩买一份刚刚出版的报纸，我可以在报上看到北京、鞍山和上海的工人们的成就；在各个百货公司里，我可以挑选很多带有中国商标的货物。
    这些只是日常生活中的小事情。但是，比这些更重要的是：我国人民心里都有着要求更详细地了解中国情况的愿望。我想，在这里只要提这样一件事就够了：不久前，读者们给我们的编辑部来信，要求我们报道一些关于中国的事情，有的甚至提出了具体的问题。譬如：中国规模最大的建设工程是什么，二万五千里长征是在什么时候、在什么情况下进行的，等等。
    你想，有没有人能肯定说：在我们两国之间的距离，只能用地理学的量度才可以表现呢？不，如果说中国和匈牙利的距离很远在过去是对的话，那末，现在就恰恰相反了。
    当我们的飞机降落到北京机场的时候，我们无疑是到了一个和我们国家的风俗、习惯都不一样的国家。这里房屋的样式和我们的不同，各个城市和乡村的外貌也不同，甚至在进餐时也不是像我们那样先喝汤而是后喝的。可是，这只是我们最初感觉到的印象。几小时或几天以后，我发现更重要的是，我们祖国和中国有着共同的特点，也就是建设社会主义的人民的共同特点。
    假如有人问我，我在中国最深刻的感受是什么，我会毫不犹豫地这样回答：在一个离我们很远的国家里，我们就像一个家庭的成员那样地走来走去。虽然可惜我不会中文，但是，我知道马克思列宁主义的基本原理，根据这些，我就可以认识和理解中国的生活。中国人民的引人注目的成就的源泉，就是来自这个马克思列宁主义所指导的世界观，而最初感动外国客人的建设国家的努力，也是渊源于此的。
    在参观长城的时候，我想，这个奇伟的建筑是二千多年前人民在鞭笞之下建筑的！当着建筑长城者的后代们有自由为他们自己建设的时候，他们又能够获得多么大的成就啊！
    在参观长城以后，我又参观了这个国家的几个城市，有机会看到了英雄的中国人民的各种工作的成果。六年，比起中国几千年的历史只是一个瞬间。可是在这一瞬间，中国的面貌已经大大改变了。几乎找不到恰当的词汇来表达我在参观东北的城市和工厂时所产生的感觉。在从前日本帝国主义者和国民党反动派所完全破坏了和掠夺了的地方，现在正在进行着规模巨大的建设。参观正在建设中的第一汽车制造厂的几个小时是使我一生也不会忘记的，这次参观对我说来是大有教益和值得回忆的。这个规模巨大的工厂在几年以前才开始破土兴建，而在那块本来是平坦的草原的土地上，今天的建设工作已经在巨大的现代化的车间里进行了。一百五十万平方公尺面积的厂房，在这里要安装七千架机器，四十万平方公尺面积的住宅区……这些数字都反映了中国人民伟大的创造力量，反映了人民革命在劳动人民中间激发起来的无尽的工作愿望。
    中国人民有很多优良的本性，长久以来形成的而到现在才开始完全发挥的本性。中国人民的努力也表现在无数小块土地上模范性的耕作上。中国人的手的灵巧，在世界上是人所共知的，丰富多采的古代艺术和以绘画天才为前提的书法也表现出了这个。我到现在才发现，人民这样的一种本性一旦同自由连接起来，会有何等重大的意义啊！人民的努力不但能够耕种一小块土地，而且能够管理巨大的集体农庄，建设规模很大的工厂和城市。手的灵巧现在不但是顶好的雕刻和绘画所需要的，而且也是精致的仪器、镟床、电气设备所需要的。
    有机会和中国劳动者见面和谈话，这对我来说是一种特殊的享受。说老实话，我要研究研究究竟是什么原因使人民获得具有历史意义的胜利，使人民解放了这个幅员广大的国家的。
    在谈话和互相认识以后，我发现，获得这种胜利的原因首先是人民对党和国家的无限热爱。
    国营北京第二棉纺织厂的一个女工这样说：
      “我在解放前的生活，基本上不能算是生活，我自从童年起就在上海资本家的纺织厂中工作，我的工资连我吃饱饭也不够。我每天工作十八小时，每月的工资只等于十七公斤的大米。解放以后我得到了新的住宅，每天工作八小时，每月的工资等于二百五十公斤大米，更重要的是党给我指出了生活的目的，那就是为了社会主义而斗争。这一切都要感谢毛主席。”
    我在哈尔滨和五位青年谈过话，他们建议组织青年垦荒队到黑龙江省去垦荒。
      “我们感谢党，感谢毛主席，青年们的现在和未来再也不是贫苦和没有前途了。”一个年青工人说：“我们知道我们的祖国需要更多的粮食，因此我们非常愉快地要垦荒去。”
    让我向我的读者们介绍一件动人的事情。在抚顺老工人住宅里面，有一个年龄较大的煤矿工人，他已经退休了，他对我这样说：
      “‘我没有家！’不久以前我这样想，可是这一句话到现在已经不对了。我的家庭现在有共产党和毛主席照顾啊！”
    我在解放以前根据几本书认识的中国，一般地可以这样说：人们都知道人民的贫苦是半殖民地压迫的非常恶劣的结果。现在，我亲眼看到了中国人民的日益美好的生活，我是多么愉快啊！在哈尔滨，在长春，在抚顺，在其他的地方，我们参观了新盖的住宅——楼房，参观了城市新建立的区，这些地方都有完全新建的卫生机构、保护母亲和儿童的机构、图书馆、戏院。虽然是很短的六年，但是如果党给人民指示了道路和目标，那末人民就能够达到高度的成就。
    记者职业的一个特点，就是从许多小事情知道很多平常很难发现的事情。譬如在参观沈阳附近一个农村时，我到了一个农村的商店，商店里的人这样说：上月农民在这里买去了二十四支金笔，从这件事可以看出农村的文化水平已经提高得很多了。这一方面说明农民已经有了买金笔的钱，另一方面说明农村人口的大部分已学会了写字认字，需要买笔了。
    还有无数的感受都涌到我的笔下来。最后我还打算记下一件事：我到北京的时候是在十月一日以前，正在准备庆祝这个节日的时候，首都有很多外国人，我碰到了一个很好的运气，好像是获得了一枚勋章一样，就是有机会参加周恩来同志的招待会。招待会设在灯火辉煌的大厅里。在这个大厅里好像五大洲所有的国家都有代表，其中有很多著名的和平战士、政治家、学者、作家和商业家，他们是有着不同的信仰和观点的。北京已表现出一个大国首都的风度，北京是今天以苏联为首的和平阵营中伟大的有威信的国家的首都。解决任何一个重要的国际问题，如果没有这个国家参加是不可想像的。北京也表现出它是一个为和平而斗争的国家的首都。由于和平思想具有共同的基础，而使五十多个国家的代表们聚集在中国的首都。在国际政治舞台上，某些人物就像谢德林著名的小说中的人物那样，他们说：中华人民共和国是不存在的。这些帝国主义分子把自己的代理人蒋介石跟中国人民、跟这个伟大的国家相混淆。但是，事实就是事实，这些家伙抹煞不了而且不久终究会要承认这个使他们很苦闷的事实，就是中华人民共和国不仅是存在着，而且很快地勇往直前地壮大起来，它已成为站在世界最前列的国家之一。
    在这篇文章结束之前，我还要加上几句话：我们，匈牙利人感到非常高兴，因为我们可以说我们是这样一个强大的、有力量的中国人民的朋友。我再重复说：我们两个国家相隔好几千公里已经算不得什么。我们的友谊不会因为有好几千公里的距离而疏远，反而会一天比一天的加强。
