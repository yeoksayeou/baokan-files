　　Cannot "Rob Peter to Pay Paul"
　　The Jiangpu Township branch in Guangning County, Guangdong Province, believing that "everything is for the development of cooperatives now," disregarded the consolidation of existing cooperatives and transferred a large number of core members from the old cooperatives to establish new ones. In one month, the township drew fourteen key members from five old cooperatives, including four chairmen and vice-chairmen, and six stronger members of the cooperative affairs committee. As a result, the old cooperatives were almost left without leadership. One old cooperative had a work team stationed there, and the impact of removing two key members was not too great; however, the production of the other cooperatives was not doing well. Consequently, the morale of many members fluctuated.

　　By transferring many core members from the old cooperatives to the new ones, the core members of the new cooperatives developed a sense of dependence, failing to use their brains to think of more solutions and failing to properly train themselves in practical work.

　　It is certainly permissible to comprehensively plan and reasonably adjust the core members of old and new cooperatives. However, disregarding the old cooperatives and only caring about the new ones; only wanting ready-made core members and not paying attention to cultivating new forces in both the old and new cooperatives, is definitely not a good leadership method, but merely "robbing Peter to pay Paul."

　  不可“剜肉补疮”
    广东省广宁县江?乡支部，认为“现在一切为了发展合作社”，就不顾巩固老社，并且大批抽出老社的骨干分子去建立新社。这个乡一个多月里，就从五个老社里抽走了十四名主要骨干分子，其中有正副主任各四人，较强的社务委员六人。这样一来，老社差不多等于没人领导了。一个老社驻有工作组，抽走了两个骨干影响还不太大；别的几个老社的生产都搞得不好。因此，许多社员的情绪发生了波动。
    把老社的许多骨干抽到了新社，新社的骨干就产生了依赖思想，不开动脑筋多想办法，不能很好地在实际工作中锻炼。
    按照全面规划，合理地调整老社新社的骨干分子，当然是可以的。但是，不顾老社，只顾新社；只要现成的骨干分子，不注意在老社和新社中培养新生力量，这决不是好的领导方法，只不过是“剜肉补疮”。
