　  Fujian's First Cement Plant Starts Production
    Fujian's first cement plant officially started production on November 10th. The first batch of cement has already been transported to a certain hydropower station construction site.

    In the past, Fujian relied entirely on other provinces for its cement supply. Due to inconvenient transportation and difficulties in shipping, the supply often fell short, and transportation costs were very high. The transportation costs for the cement imported into Fujian Province last year alone were more than the entire investment in building this factory. Now that this cement plant has started production, Fujian Province can not only be self-sufficient in the cement needed for basic construction but can also supply some for the construction of the Yingxia Railway.

    The entire production process of this cement plant, except for the mining of limestone, is fully or semi-mechanized.

    Since construction began in October 1953, this factory has received support from many heavy industrial units across the country. All the equipment was manufactured by domestic machinery workers. (Our collective correspondent, Fujian Daily Editorial Department)

### 福建第一座水泥厂开工生产

　  福建第一座水泥厂开工生产
    福建第一座水泥厂已在十一月十日正式投入生产。首批水泥已经运往某水电站工地。
    过去，福建所需水泥，全赖外省供给，由于交通不便，运输困难，往往供应不及，而且运费很高。仅去年运进福建省内的水泥所需的运费就比建这个厂的全部投资还多。现在，这座水泥厂投入生产后，福建省内基本建设所需的水泥不仅可以自给，而且部分还可以供应修建鹰厦铁路。
    这座水泥厂的整个生产过程，除开采石灰石外，其他工序全部是机械化和半机械化。
    这个厂自一九五三年十月动工以来，得到各地许多重工业单位的支援。全部设备都是国内机械工人制造的。（本报集体通讯员福建日报编辑部）
