Xinhua News Agency, 25th - According to a Kyodo News Agency report on the 24th, over one hundred and fifty Chinese nationals scheduled to return home on the Japanese ship "Kouan Maru" held a meeting in Maizuru on the 24th, again passing a resolution demanding that the Japanese government immediately release Hong Jinshan, Pan Guangkun, Guo Quanzao, Gu Minsheng, and Cai Jinxiu, the five overseas Chinese who were unreasonably arrested and detained. They also resolved that if the Japanese government continues to refuse the just demand of allowing Hong Jinshan and the other five to board the "Kouan Maru" and return home with them, they would resolutely refuse to board the ship.

    The resolution of the Chinese nationals was made after listening to reports from representatives of the Japanese Red Cross Society, the Japan Peace Liaison Council, and the Japan-China Friendship Association, three groups that had negotiated with the Japanese government, regarding the Japanese government's insincere attitude. The reports from the three groups explained that the Japanese government, disregarding the protests of the Chinese nationals and the Chinese government authorities, still attempted to prevent Hong Jinshan and the other five from voluntarily boarding the "Kouan Maru" to return home.

    The Chinese nationals handed the resolution of the meeting to the representatives of the three Japanese groups and expressed their hope that the representatives of the three groups would continue to negotiate with the Japanese government authorities.

　　预定归国的华侨一百多人在舞鹤举行大会
　　要求日政府释放被逮捕和拘留的五名华侨
    新华社二十五日讯　据共同社二十四日报道，预定搭乘日轮“兴安丸”回国的中国侨民一百五十多人，二十四日在舞鹤举行大会，再次通过决议，要求日本政府立即释放被无理逮捕和拘留的洪进山、潘广坤、郭全灶、顾敏生、蔡晋修等五名华侨，并且决议如果日本政府继续拒绝让洪进山等五人搭
  “兴安丸”同他们一起回国的正当要求，他们就坚决不上船。
    中国侨民的决议是在听取了同日本政府进行过交涉的日本红十字会、日本和平联络会、日中友好协会三团体的代表关于日本政府毫无诚意的态度的报告以后作出的。三团体的报告说明，日本政府不顾中国侨民和中国政府当局的抗议，仍然企图不让洪进山等五人根据其自愿搭乘“兴安丸”回国。
    中国侨民把大会决议交给了日本三团体的代表，并且表示希望三团体代表继续同日本政府当局进行交涉。
