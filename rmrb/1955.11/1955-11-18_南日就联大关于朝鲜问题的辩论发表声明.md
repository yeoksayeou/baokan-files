Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 17th:
　　Nam Il, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, issued a statement on November 16th regarding the United Nations debate on the Korean question. The full text is as follows:
　　I, on behalf of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, requested on October 31, 1955, that representatives of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea be allowed to participate in the discussion of the Korean question at the United Nations.
　　Despite the fact that representatives of several countries have supported this request of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the Political Committee of the current session of the United Nations General Assembly, the request has not been accepted due to the unreasonable insistence of representatives of certain countries, and the Korean question is being discussed unilaterally.
　　I regret to note that this action not only violates the original principles of the United Nations Charter but also contradicts the spirit of Geneva. Without representatives of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea participating in the discussion of the Korean question, a fair solution to the Korean question cannot be expected.
　　A just solution to the Korean question would not only eliminate the misfortune of the Korean people but also greatly contribute to maintaining world peace and reducing international tensions.
　　In order for the armistice in Korea to become a solid peace, and to achieve the unification of Korea through peaceful means, all countries concerned with the Korean question should take practical measures as soon as possible.
　　To eliminate the danger of renewed war in Korea, the Armistice Agreement must first be observed, and therefore, the activities of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, which actively helps to observe the Armistice Agreement, must be guaranteed.
　　The unification of Korea should be achieved by the Korean people themselves through peaceful means, and to achieve this goal, all-Korean elections should be held based on the free will of the people of North and South Korea.
　　All foreign armed forces, including the Chinese People's Volunteers, must withdraw simultaneously from the entire territory of North and South Korea before the holding of general elections in Korea.
　　In order to ease tensions in Korea, the existing armed forces of North and South Korea should be reduced to a minimum, mutual contact between the two parts of Korea should be realized, and the people of the two parts should be given complete freedom to conduct political activities.
　　Anyone who refuses to negotiate with the representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea or hinders the reconciliation of North and South Korea should bear the full responsibility for delaying the unification of Korea on a democratic basis.
　　The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will actively strive to achieve the peaceful reunification of Korea as soon as possible based on the above-mentioned basic principles.

### 南日就联大关于朝鲜问题的辩论发表声明

　　南日就联大关于朝鲜问题的辩论发表声明
    新华社平壤十七日电　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相南日就联合国关于朝鲜问题的辩论在十一月十六日发表了一个声明。全文如下：
    我奉朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府之命，已经在一九五五年十月三十一日要求让朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的代表参加在联合国的关于朝鲜问题的讨论。
    尽管已经有好些国家的代表在联合国大会本届会议的政治委员会中支持了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的这个要求，但是由于某些国家代表的无理坚持，这个要求没有被接受，朝鲜问题是在片面地讨论。
    我遗憾地认为，这种行动不仅仅是破坏了联合国宪章的原来原则，并且是和日内瓦精神相抵触的。没有朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的代表参加朝鲜问题的讨论，是不能希望朝鲜问题得到公正的解决的。
    公正解决朝鲜问题不仅可以消除朝鲜人民的不幸，而且将大大有助于维护世界和平和减少国际紧张局势。
    为了有可能使朝鲜的停战成为稳固的和平，以及通过和平方法来实现朝鲜的统一，同朝鲜问题有关各国应当尽早采取切实可行的措施。
    为了消除朝鲜战争重起的危险，首先必须遵守停战协定，因此，对于遵守停战协定有积极帮助的中立国监察委员会的活动必须予以保证。
    朝鲜的统一应当由朝鲜人民自己通过和平的方法来实现，而且为了达到这个目的，应当在表示南北朝鲜人民的自由意志的基础上举行全朝鲜选举。
    所有外国武装部队、包括中国人民志愿军在内，必须在朝鲜举行大选之前，同时从南北朝鲜的整个领土上撤退。
    为了要缓和朝鲜紧张局势，南北朝鲜现有武装部队应当裁减到最低限度，朝鲜两部分的相互接触应当实现，两部分人民群众应当得到进行政治活动的完全自由。
    凡是拒绝同朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表进行谈判或妨碍南北朝鲜修好的人，应当承担拖延在民主的基础上统一朝鲜的全部责任。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府将根据上述基本原则积极努力，争取及早实现朝鲜和平统一。
         朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相　南日　一九五五年十一月十六日于平壤
