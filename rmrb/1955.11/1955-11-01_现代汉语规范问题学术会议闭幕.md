Xinhua News Agency, October 31st—The Academic Conference on the Standardization of Modern Chinese concluded today after six days of meetings.

    Linguists and representatives from literature, drama, broadcasting, and publishing, after repeated discussions, unanimously clarified the importance of standardizing modern Chinese. At the conference, representatives used vivid examples to demonstrate the urgent need for standardization of the common language of the Han nationality. The conference concluded that a common understanding of the standardization issue provides a solid foundation for further practice. The conference linguistically demonstrated the correctness of the proposal made by the National Conference on Writing Reform to promote Mandarin Chinese (Putonghua) – the common language of the Han nationality – based on Northern dialects and with Beijing pronunciation as the standard pronunciation, considering this to be in line with the actual situation and historical development of the Chinese language. First, the term "based on Northern dialects" is appropriate, which precisely aligns with the Marxist linguistic principle that a national common language develops based on a certain dialect. Northern dialects are the most widely distributed in China, thus possessing national significance, and they embody the general trend of Chinese language development, in fact already forming the basis of the common language of the Han nationality. Using Beijing pronunciation as the standard pronunciation is also correct because the representative dialect of Northern dialects is Beijing dialect, and Beijing pronunciation has the greatest commonality and universality among Northern dialects.

    The conference also discussed many specialized issues, such as detailed standardization of standard pronunciation, specific methods for lexical and grammatical standardization, and whether written and spoken language should be differentiated. These issues require further in-depth study in the future.

    The conference, after pointing out the scientific research topics related to the standardization of modern Chinese that should be carried out in the future, had fifty-five representatives and guests accept fifty-three research topics, including several aspects such as phonetics, dialects, grammar, vocabulary, and dictionary compilation.

    The conference pointed out that the standardization of Chinese is a major issue concerning the lives of 500 million Han people. On the one hand, it is a broad social movement; without the understanding and voluntary participation of the broad masses of people, great victories cannot be achieved. Therefore, widespread publicity must be carried out to patiently explain its importance to the masses. On the other hand, it is also a detailed scientific research task, and linguists should be organized in various forms to divide labor, cooperate, and exchange experiences.

    The conference also passed a resolution. The resolution clarified the understanding of the two concepts of Putonghua and the standardization of modern Chinese; emphasized the importance of uniting linguists, as well as workers in literature, drama, broadcasting, news, and publishing, across the country to jointly conduct linguistic scientific research for the standardization of modern Chinese; and put forward suggestions for specific work that should be done in standardization in the future.

    现代汉语规范问题学术会议闭幕
    新华社三十一日讯　现代汉语规范问题学术会议开了六天，今日闭幕。
    参加会议的语言学工作者和文学、戏剧、广播、出版等方面的代表们经过反复地讨论，一致明确了现代汉语规范化的重要意义。会上，代表们以生动的事例论证了汉民族共同语迫切要求规范化的道理。会议认为对规范化问题有了共同的认识，进一步的实践就有了良好的基础。会议从语言学上论证了全国文字改革会议提出的推广以北方话为基础方言、以北京语音为标准音的普通话——汉民族共同语的正确性，认为这是符合汉语的实际情况和历史发展的。首先，以北方话为基础方言的提法是恰当的，这正是符合马克思主义语言学的原则——民族共同语是以某一方言为基础发展而成的；北方话在中国分布最广，所以具有全国性意义，而且北方话体现着汉语发展的一般趋势，事实上已成为汉民族共同语的基础；以北京语音为标准音也是正确的，因为北方话的代表方言是北京话，北京语音具有北方方言中最大的共同点，有最大的普遍性。
    这次会议还讨论了许多专门性的问题，例如：标准音的详细规范化问题、词汇和语法规范化的具体做法、书面语和口语是否要有分别等等。这些问题还有待于今后作进一步的深入研究。
    会议指出今后应进行的有关现代汉语规范化的科学研究题目后，有五十五个代表和来宾接受了五十三个研究题目，包括语音、方言、语法、词汇和词典编纂等几个方面。
    会议指出：汉语规范化是关系着五亿汉族人民生活的重大问题，它一方面是一个广泛的社会运动，不使广大人民理解并自愿地参加这一运动，是不能得到巨大胜利的，因此，必须广泛地进行宣传，耐心地向群众说明它的重要性；另一方面，它也是一件细致的科学研究工作，应该用各种形式把语言学工作者组织起来，分工合作，交流经验。
    会议并通过了一项决议。决议中说明了对普通话和现代汉语规范化两个概念的认识；强调了团结全国语言工作者以及文学、戏剧、广播、新闻、出版等方面工作者为现代汉语规范化共同进行语言科学研究的重要性；并对今后在规范化方面应该做的具体工作提出了建议。
