Everyone believed that Chairman Mao's instructions and these reports gave them great inspiration and education and unanimously expressed their wholehearted support.

　　During the meeting, the committee members attending the meeting discussed for more than ten days in groups and more than three days in a general meeting the issues raised in the instructions and reports of the central leaders regarding the future of socialism and communism, the business community's control of its own destiny, the policy of gradually and peacefully transforming capitalist industry and commerce, the "redemption" policy for the private means of production of the bourgeoisie, the cultivation of progressive core members of the business community, the role of the united front, and the propaganda and education work on the socialist transformation of the business community, as well as the measures to be taken in the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce, such as overall planning, unified arrangement, economic reorganization, overall public-private partnership, the organization of specialized companies, and the gradual implementation of fixed interest rates in public-private joint ventures. The discussions were heated from beginning to end, with seventy-three committee members speaking at the plenary session.

　　During the meeting, through serious study, repeated discussions, recollection and comparison, self-criticism and mutual criticism, the committee members realized that accepting socialist transformation is the only bright road, and expressed their determination to control their own destiny and combine their future with the bright and broad socialist future of the country. When narrating the changes in their thinking since liberation, the vast majority of committee members expressed that they would continue to work hard to transform themselves in the future.

　　During the discussions, many committee members introduced and exchanged the achievements and experiences of the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce in various places, using vivid and concrete examples to prove that the state's peaceful transformation of capitalist industry and commerce has been effective. The committee members believed that the principles and methods for socialist transformation of private industry and commerce put forward by the central leaders at this meeting were completely correct. They also put forward many positive suggestions for promoting these methods and raised opinions on the shortcomings existing in the work.

　　At the discussion meeting, the committee members felt it was an unparalleled honor to be a core member in the socialist transformation cause, expressed their willingness to further accept socialist transformation, and set an example to promote other industrialists and businessmen to accept socialist transformation and assist the government in doing a good job in transforming private industry and commerce.

　　The meeting concluded with a closing speech by Li Zhuchen, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce.

　　In his closing speech, Li Zhuchen said: The main task of this meeting is how to further promote the national industrialists and businessmen to actively accept socialist transformation, and now the meeting has successfully completed its task. This meeting is the most fruitful and effective meeting of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce. We should thank the leadership and instructions of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

　　Li Zhuchen said: In the group and plenary discussions, under the great appeal of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, many committee members, combined with the understanding of the social development law that capitalism is bound to perish and socialism is bound to prosper, conducted a relatively deep self-examination and self-criticism, exposing the past exploitation thoughts of harming others and benefiting oneself and seeking only profit, and further realized the truth that private ownership by capitalists must be gradually replaced by socialist ownership by the whole people. He hoped that after everyone returns to their posts, they must, under the leadership of the local CCP committees and governments, convey the spirit and gains of this meeting to the vast number of industrialists and businessmen across the country in a universal and in-depth manner, so that the masses of the business community can gradually understand the laws of social development, see the future clearly, love the motherland, and actively accept socialist transformation.

　　When the meeting closed, the entire audience cheered "Long live the People's Republic of China!" "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!" "Long live the great and beloved Chairman Mao!"
