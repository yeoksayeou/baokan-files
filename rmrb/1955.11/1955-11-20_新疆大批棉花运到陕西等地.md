　  Large Quantities of Xinjiang Cotton Shipped to Shaanxi and Other Places
    Large quantities of new cotton from the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region are being continuously shipped to the interior. According to statistics from November 1st to 7th, 300,000 jin of cotton were shipped to Shaanxi and other places. This batch of cotton is white in color and has long fibers, suitable for spinning 32 to 42 count fine yarn.

    This year, Xinjiang's 1.1 million mu of cotton fields have generally had a bumper harvest. The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company will, in addition to planned supplies for Xinjiang's textile industry and the needs of the military and civilians, transfer large quantities of surplus cotton to the interior to support the interior's textile industry.

　  新疆大批棉花运到陕西等地
    新疆维吾尔自治区大批新棉正源源运往内地。根据十一月一日到七日的统计，就有三十万斤棉花运往陕西等地。这批棉花色泽白、纤维长，可纺三十二支到四十二支细纱。
    今年，新疆的一百一十万亩棉花普遍丰收，新疆维吾尔自治区花纱布公司除将有计划地供应新疆纺织工业及军民需要外，余棉将大批调往内地，支援内地纺织工业。
