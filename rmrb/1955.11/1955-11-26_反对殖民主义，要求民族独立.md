    开罗电台说，阿拉伯联盟政治委员会通过了一项决议，要求英国撤退它在布赖米绿洲的军队，并且要求建立一个中立国仲裁委员会，以及由英国同沙特阿拉伯举行直接谈判来和平解决布赖米绿洲问题。
　  摩洛哥人民抗议法殖民者暴行
    卡萨布兰卡消息：卡萨布兰卡有十五万以上的摩洛哥人二十二日举行游行示威，抗议监狱看守兵在二十一日开枪打死和打伤了约二十个政治犯，并且为死难者送葬。码头、工厂、建筑工地和公用事业的工人都举行了总罢工，阿拉伯人的商店也全关上了门。
    法国当局派出好几卡车的法国兵去监视示威者，还出动侦察机在空中盘旋，空气非常紧张。
    同时，据美联社消息，法国当局还派增援部队到北部靠近西（班牙）属摩洛哥边境的地区去。这个地方在不久以前曾经爆发过摩洛哥人民的武装起义。
  　塞浦路斯人民连续举行反英示威
    塞浦路斯居民反对英国殖民统治的运动正在继续开展。塞浦路斯居民为了抗议一个被判处死刑的塞浦路斯青年的上诉遭到拒绝而举行的示威运动从十四日开始连续进行了四天之久。英国警察和部队在利马索尔港数度使用催泪瓦斯来驱散示威群众。
    塞浦路斯首府尼科西亚的学生二十二日继续举行反对英国殖民统治的示威游行。当学生们在凡纳罗米尼教堂集合的时候，教堂附近的建筑工人宣布罢工，表示对学生的同情。很多工人参加了学生的队伍，他们在尼科西亚的街道上游行，高喊“英国人滚出去！”英国当局出动了大批警察和军队，用催泪弹和水龙袭击示威者。
　  尼日利亚东区人民要求独立
    尼日利亚东区总理纳姆迪·阿齐克卫博士十一月十六日在伦敦举行记者招待会，他在会上说，尼日利亚人民对于他们国家目前的政治地位感到不满。他说：“尼日利亚人不愿意作殖民地人民。尼日利亚人自觉地努力在黑种人和白种人之间建立一种善意的气氛，但是尼日利亚人希望自由，并且希望在英联邦中享有独立国家的地位。”
    他还说，在他访问英国期间，他同英国工业家们讨论了帮助尼日利亚发展工业的建议。他指出，英国工业家们的回答一直是不能令人满意的。他说，如果英国工业家们不愿意帮助尼日利亚，那末，尼日利亚人就会向其他国家寻求援助。
