　　Hohhot dispatch, November 27th: The Jining-Eren Railway has passed the acceptance inspection by the State Acceptance and Handover Commission of the State Council on November 27th and is ready to be officially handed over to the state for use on December 1st.
　　The Jining-Eren Railway Acceptance and Handover Commission was established at the end of October this year. It conducted a detailed technical inspection of the Jining-Eren line's roadbed, bridges and culverts, track laying and ballast, communication signals, housing, water supply, power equipment, and mechanical installation projects. The commission found that the engineering quality was good and basically met the national requirements and standards. For individual projects that needed repair, the relevant construction units have been ordered to speed up the completion so that through traffic and joint operations can begin on New Year's Day in 1956.
　　Construction of the Jining-Eren Railway began in May 1953. It is the first international through-traffic trunk line newly built during China's First Five-Year Plan. The railway is 335 kilometers long, with 155 kilometers of station tracks, 283 bridges and culverts, eight water supply stations, 160,000 square meters of housing, and a large number of mechanical installation and communication signal equipment. The Jining-Eren Railway closely connects Beijing with Ulaanbaatar and Moscow. Taking the Beijing-Baotou Railway and transferring to the Jining-Eren Railway to Moscow is more than 1,100 kilometers shorter than going via Manchuria. The construction of the Jining-Eren Railway has a significant role in strengthening ties between China and the Soviet Union, Mongolia, and other people's democratic countries, and in accelerating China's socialist construction. The Jining-Eren Railway is built on the Inner Mongolian grasslands, which is of great significance for strengthening national unity and building the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
　　Hohhot dispatch, November 27th: Various construction projects of the Jining-Eren Railway have been basically completed. Currently, except for the mechanical installation project which is underway, the housing, water supply, communication signals, and other projects have been basically completed by the end of November.
　　In the past two years, a total of more than 160,000 square meters of various factory buildings, large warehouses, residential buildings, schools, etc. have been built along the line. Eight water supply stations were built in water-scarce and sandy areas. This railway trunk line also has a large number of the latest equipment. Among the hundreds of types of mechanical equipment for locomotive, rolling stock, and electrical services, many are the latest products from China, the Soviet Union, and other people's democratic countries. In the housing construction project, the workers promoted the advanced experience of winter construction in the Soviet Union and put forward many rationalization proposals, saving the state 162,400 yuan in construction investment. For example, in the construction of water supply projects, the workers constantly proposed suggestions to change designs, pipelines, etc., saving the state 84,200 yuan in construction funds.

　　集二铁路已经国家验收完毕准备交付使用
    本报呼和浩特二十七日电　集二铁路已经在十一月二十七日经国务院国家验收交接委员会验收完毕，并准备在十二月一日正式交付国家使用。
    集二铁路验收交接委员会在今年十月底成立后，曾对集二线路基、桥涵、铺轨铺碴、通信信号、房屋、给水、动力设备和机械安装等工程进行详细的技术检查，认为工程质量良好，基本上合乎国家要求标准。对个别工程需要整修的已经命令各有关施工单位加紧完成，以便在一九五六年元旦开始通车联运。
    集二铁路是在一九五三年五月动工修建的，是我国第一个五年计划期间新建成的第一条国际联运的干线。铁路全长三百三十五公里，站线一百五十五公里，桥涵二百八十三座，给水八处，房屋面积十六万平方公尺，以及大量的机械安装、通信信号设备等。集二铁路把北京和乌兰巴托、莫斯科紧紧联在一起。从北京坐京包铁路转集二铁路到莫斯科，比经满洲里到莫斯科要近一千一百多公里。集二铁路的建筑，对加强中国同苏联、蒙古及其他人民民主国家的联系，加速我国社会主义建设有极大的作用。集二铁路建立在内蒙古草原上，对加强民族团结，建设内蒙古自治区也有重大意义。
    本报呼和浩特二十七日电　集二线各项建设工程已经基本结束。现在全线除了机械安装工程正在紧张进行外，到十一月底，房屋、给水、通信信号等工程都已基本完成。
    两年多来，全线已建筑各种厂房和大型仓库以及住屋、学校等共十六万多平方公尺。在缺水含砂地带建筑给水八处。这条铁路干线还拥有大量最新式的设备。在几百种机务、车务、电务等方面的机械设备中，有许多是中国和苏联、各人民民主国家最新的产品。在房屋建筑工程中，由于职工们推广了苏联冬季施工的先进经验，和提出许多合理化建议，为国家节省了建设投资十六万两千四百多元。例如在给水工程建设中，职工们不断提出改变设计、管线等建议，给国家节省建设资金八万四千二百多元。
