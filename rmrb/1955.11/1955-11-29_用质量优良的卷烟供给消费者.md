Supply Consumers with High-Quality Cigarettes
	Wang Yizhi, Director of the Food Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry

	Improving product quality is the most important issue for cigarette manufacturing enterprises at present.

	In the past few years, the output of the national cigarette industry has increased year by year; the consumption of tobacco leaves and the cost per carton of cigarettes have decreased year by year. However, this year there was a serious phenomenon of a general decline in quality, especially in the four months of May, June, July, and August. During this period, the Shanghai State-owned Tobacco Industry Company alone received 146 letters from consumers, including criticisms of the tobacco being black, having a grassy smell, tasting bitter, being harsh, and going out; criticisms of the cigarette sticks having empty heads, being loose, oily, bursting, and containing impurities; and criticisms of packaging being short of sticks or mispacked. Cigarettes are a mass consumer product, and the decline in quality not only causes dissatisfaction among the majority of consumers, but also causes serious economic and political losses to the state and enterprises. Therefore, we must pay close attention to this issue.

	The objective reasons for the low quality of cigarette sticks are that the variety of tobacco leaves does not meet production needs, there are many broken leaves, and there are many impurities and dust. According to the requirements of the cigarette industry, it is best to use aged tobacco leaves. However, due to the growth of tobacco leaf production in our country not keeping up with the growth of industrial production, apart from grade A tobacco, there is very little use of aged tobacco leaves at present. According to Soviet experience, tobacco leaves should be stored for 25 days after fermentation. However, due to the insufficient supply of tobacco leaves, many cigarette factories use the tobacco leaves as soon as they are fermented. Many small factories have not yet used fermented tobacco leaves. However, the main reason for the poor quality of cigarettes is the backwardness of the technical and management work of the enterprises. For a long time, there has not been a scientific and complete technological process in the national cigarette factories; there has been no actual testing and scientific appraisal of the technical requirements for workshop temperature and humidity and various processes in the production process. Therefore, there are many inconsistent and unreasonable phenomena in the technical operations of various factories. For example, the tobacco width is 0.8 mm in the Qingdao State-owned Cigarette Factory and 0.55 mm in the Harbin State-owned Cigarette Factory. In the tobacco moisturizing process, the longest time is 24 hours, and the shortest is only 2 hours. In the stem moisturizing process, the longest time is 24 hours, and the shortest is only 4 hours. The longest storage time for tobacco leaves after drying is 48 hours, and the shortest is only 4 hours. Some factories simply pursue the output per machine and try to increase the temperature of steaming and drying, resulting in the dark color of the tobacco. Moreover, the excessive temperature in the workshop also affects the operation of the workers.

	There are also many problems in the leadership ideology and organizational measures of enterprises. This year, in the movement to increase production and practice economy, the leading staff of many factories had the view of simply pursuing output and one-sided economizing. At present, the equipment utilization rate of the national cigarette industry is only 30%, but some factories increase the speed of the cigarette machine from 850 revolutions to 900 revolutions or even more than 1,000 revolutions in order to increase output. The output per machine of other main machines has also generally increased by about 20%. Improperly increasing the speed will make the cigarette sticks too loose or too tight. If the cigarette sticks are too loose, it is easy to cause empty heads, and if they are too tight, it is easy to cause "bamboo joint cigarettes." Some factories use the method of reducing the amount of silk in a single carton of cigarettes to "save" tobacco leaves, but as a result, although the tobacco leaves are saved, the weight of the cigarette sticks is reduced. In addition, the allocation of products produced by various factories is also unreasonable. For example, there are several cigarette factories in Shanghai, and on the one hand, each factory produces several different varieties at the same time; on the other hand, the same brand of cigarettes is produced in several factories. This adds unnecessary trouble to the technical and management work of the factory, making it difficult for workers to become familiar with the technology. Many factories do not have unified inspection standards and inspection systems. When the product quality is good, the inspection standards are higher, and when the product quality declines, the inspection standards are also lowered, which does not play a technical supervision role in production.

	In order to improve the product quality of the national cigarette industry and further reduce the loss rate of tobacco leaves, the Ministry of Light Industry convened a national cigarette technology conference in August this year. In addition to criticizing the view of simply pursuing output and one-sided economizing, the conference also required cigarette factories to improve the quality of cigarette sticks and reduce the loss rate of tobacco leaves based on the advanced experience of various factories in the country. The loss rate of grade A tobacco leaves should be reduced to below 0.75% to 0.8%, grade B tobacco leaves should be reduced to below 1% to 1.2%, and grade C tobacco leaves can be reduced to below 1.7% to 2%. The reject rate of cigarette sticks should also be reduced. According to the annual output of cigarettes in the country, if the average loss rate of tobacco leaves in all factories is reduced by 0.1%, 4,000 more cartons of cigarettes can be produced annually with the same amount of tobacco leaves; if the average reject rate of all factories is reduced by 0.1%, 4,000 more cartons of cigarettes can be produced annually. If the reduction of the tobacco leaf loss rate and the cigarette stick reject rate is not 0.1%, but 0.2%, 0.3%, or even 1%, more cigarettes will be produced. This means that striving to complete the technical indicators put forward by the National Cigarette Industry Technology Conference has great economic significance.

	Some people believe that it is impossible to improve the quality of cigarette sticks before the supply of tobacco leaves is improved, and therefore they lack confidence in completing the technical indicators put forward by the National Cigarette Industry Technology Conference. Of course, it is difficult to fundamentally improve the quality of cigarette sticks without improving the supply of tobacco leaves. However, the experience of the past two months has proved that correctly formulating, revising, and implementing the cigarette process regulations and actively promoting various advanced experiences can gradually improve the quality of cigarettes under the current conditions of tobacco leaf supply. The cigarette quality of cigarette factories that have initially implemented the process regulations and promoted advanced experiences has improved significantly. For example, the empty head of Shanghai Qianmen brand cigarettes accounted for 20.5% in July, and has dropped to 0.5% in October; the empty head of Feima brand cigarettes accounted for 30% in July, and has dropped to 2.5% in October. In July, the bamboo joint cigarettes of Shanghai Labor brand cigarettes accounted for 23.25%, and dropped to 12.5% in October; the large and small bamboo joint cigarettes of Hongjin brand cigarettes accounted for 12.75% in July, and have dropped to 0.5% in October, and large bamboo joint cigarettes have been basically eliminated. From August to October 20, the Shanghai Sino-Private Joint Venture Nanyang Cigarette Factory had 78 occurrences of bursting cigarettes, totaling more than 868,000 cigarettes. Later, this factory initially promoted the experience of Huacheng and other cigarette factories in making paste, and promoted the advanced experience of improving the paste wheel and reducing the speed of the paste wheel, and there was no bursting cigarette for eight consecutive days. The drying section of the Tianjin State-owned Cigarette Factory used to produce about 280 kilograms of dry tobacco when starting and stopping the machine every day. Since learning the advanced experience of the Shenyang State-owned Cigarette Factory in preventing dry heads and dry tails, the adverse phenomenon of dry heads and dry tails of tobacco has been basically eliminated. The Shanghai State-owned Cigarette Factory No. 2 learned from the experience of the Qingdao State-owned Cigarette Factory and reduced the output per machine of the stem drawing machine from 80 kilograms to 60 kilograms, and the proportion of leaves in the stems was reduced by half.

	Many facts have proved that all those who seriously promote the advanced experience of Soviet artificial fermentation of tobacco leaves can improve the quality of tobacco leaves. Therefore, cigarette factories that have promoted artificial fermentation of tobacco leaves should try to continue to improve and improve the fermentation technology; appropriately increase the amount of fermented tobacco used according to the grade of the cigarette sticks. At present, the main thing is to actively promote the advanced experience of small-package fermentation of the Changchun State-owned Cigarette Factory. This is the specific application of the advanced experience of Soviet artificial fermentation in Chinese cigarette factories. According to this experience, the fermentation volume can be increased by 40% by using the original fermentation equipment. Controlling the moisture and temperature of the semi-finished products and the temperature and humidity of the workshop also plays a great role in improving the quality of cigarette sticks. Cigarette factories that do not have or lack instruments should consider adding some necessary instruments.

	The above facts show that it is entirely possible to improve the quality of cigarette sticks and reduce the loss rate of tobacco leaves. Unfortunately, up to now, some factories are still shouting slogans to improve quality, "preparing" for a long time, and stagnating. Some cigarette factories simply improve the quality by increasing the weight of the tobacco, resulting in not only exceeding the planned target for the consumption quota of tobacco leaves per carton, but also making the cigarette sticks too tight and hard due to excessive tobacco. These erroneous practices must be quickly corrected in order to ensure the quality of raw materials and ensure that high-quality cigarettes are supplied to the vast consumers.

　　用质量优良的卷烟供给消费者
　　轻工业部食品工业管理局局长　王毅之
    提高产品质量，是制烟工业企业当前最重要的一个问题。
    几年来，全国制烟工业的产量一年比一年高；每箱烟的烟叶消耗量和成本一年比一年低。但是今年一度发生了质量普遍下降的严重现象，其中尤以五、六、七、八四个月最为严重。在这一段期间，仅上海国营烟草工业公司所属各厂所接到的消费者来信就有一百四十六件，其中有批评烟丝发黑、有青草气、味苦、凶辣、熄火的，有批评烟支空头、松软、油烟、爆烟、含杂物的，也有批评包装缺支、错装的。卷烟是一种群众性的消费品，质量降低了，既引起广大消费者的不满，也使国家和企业在经济上、政治上蒙受严重的损失。因此，对于这个问题，我们必须十分注意。
    烟支质量低的客观原因是烟叶的品种不合生产需要，碎叶多，杂质多、尘土多。按照制烟工业的要求，使用隔年烟叶最好。但是，由于我国目前烟叶生产的增长赶不上工业生产增长的需要，目前除甲级烟外，很少有使用隔年烟叶的。按照苏联的经验，烟叶发酵以后，应该存放二十五天。但是，由于烟叶供应不足，许多烟厂都是烟叶刚发酵好就用了。许多小工厂到现在还没有使用发酵烟叶。但是，造成卷烟质量低劣的主要原因，还是企业的技术工作和管理工作太落后。长期以来，全国的卷烟工厂一直没有一个科学的完整的工艺规程；对车间温湿度和产品在制过程中各个工序的技术要求，没有进行实地的试验和科学的鉴定。因此，各个工厂在技术操作方面有许多不一致、不合理的现象。例如烟丝宽度，国营青岛烟厂为零点八公厘，国营哈尔滨烟厂为零点五五公厘。润烟工序，时间最长的是二十四小时，最短的只有二小时。润梗工序，最长的时间有二十四小时，最短的只有四小时。烟叶的烘后储存时间，最长的有四十八小时，最短的只有四小时。有的工厂单纯追求台时产量，尽量增加蒸烟和烘丝温度，结果使烟丝颜色发暗。而且车间温度过高，也影响工人操作。
    企业的领导思想和组织措施方面也有许多问题。今年在增产节约运动中，许多厂的领导工作人员，都曾有单纯追求产量和片面节约的观点。目前全国卷烟工业设备利用率不过百分之三十，但是有的工厂为了提高产量，就把卷烟机的车速从八百五十转提高到九百转甚至一千转以上。其他主要机器的台时产量一般也提高了百分之二十左右。不适当地提高车速，就会使烟支过松或过紧。烟支过松，就容易造成空头，过紧就容易造成“竹节烟”。有些工厂用减少单箱烟含丝量的办法来“节约”烟叶，结果烟叶虽然节约了，烟支的重量却减轻了。此外，对各厂所生产的产品的分配也不合理。例如上海一地有好几家烟厂，一方面，每一个工厂在一天内同时生产着好几种不同的品种；另一方面，同一个牌子的卷烟又分散在好几家工厂里生产。这样便给工厂的技术工作和管理工作增加了不必要的麻烦，使工人不容易熟悉技术。许多工厂没有统一的检验标准和检验制度。产品质量好了，检验标准就高一些，产品质量下降了，检验标准也随着降低，对生产没有发挥技术监督的作用。
    为改进全国卷烟工业的产品质量和进一步降低烟叶损耗率，今年八月间，以轻工业部为主召开了
  一个全国卷烟技术会议。这次会议除了批判单纯追求产量和片面节约的观点以外，还根据国内各厂的先进经验，要求卷烟工厂提高烟支质量和降低烟叶损耗率。甲级烟烟叶损耗率要降低到百分之零点七五到零点八以下，乙级烟要降低到百分之一到一点二以下，丙级烟可以降低到百分之一点七到二以下。烟支废品率也要降低。根据全国卷烟的年产量计算，如果所有工厂的烟叶损耗率，平均降低百分之零点一，每年就可以用同样多的烟叶增产四千箱烟；如果所有工厂的废品率平均降低百分之零点一，每年就可以增产四千箱烟。如果烟叶损耗率、烟支废品率的降低不是百分之零点一，而是百分之零点二、零点三、甚至百分之一的话，增产的卷烟就更多。这就是说，努力完成全国卷烟工业技术会议所提出的技术指标，有极大的经济意义。
    有人认为，在烟叶供应情况没有改进以前，要提高烟支质量是不可能的，因而对完成全国卷烟工业技术会议所提出的技术指标缺乏信心。当然，烟叶供应情况不改进，要根本改进烟支质量是困难的。但是两个月来的经验已经证明：正确地编制、修改和贯彻执行卷烟工艺规程和积极推广各种先进经验，是能够在目前烟叶供应的条件下逐步改进卷烟质量的。凡是初步执行了工艺规程和推广了先进经验的烟厂，卷烟质量已经有显著好转。如上海前门牌卷烟，七月份空头占百分之二十点五，十月份已降至百分之零点五；飞马牌卷烟，七月份空头占百分之三十，十月份已降至百分之二点五。七月份，上海劳动牌卷烟的竹节烟占百分之二十三点二五，十月份降至百分之十二点五；红金牌卷烟，七月份大小竹节烟占百分之十二点七五，十月份已降至百分之零点五，大竹节烟已基本消灭。上海公私合营南洋烟厂从八月至十月二十日共发生爆口烟七十八次，共计八十六万八千多支。后来这个厂初步推广了华成等烟厂打浆糊的经验，推广改进浆糊轮和降低浆轮速度的先进经验，就一连八天不出一次爆烟。国营天津烟厂烘丝工段，过去每天开车和停车的时候，都要产生干烟丝二百八十公斤左右，自从学习了国营沈阳烟厂防止干头干尾的先进经验之后，基本上消灭了烟丝干头干尾的不良现象。上海国营卷烟二厂学习国营青岛烟厂的经验，把抽梗机台时产量由八十公斤降到六十公斤以后，梗中带叶的比重就减少了一半。
    许多事实证明，凡是认真推广苏联人工发酵烟叶的先进经验的，都可以提高烟叶的品质。因此，已经推广人工发酵烟叶的烟厂，应该设法继续提高和改进发酵的技术；按烟支等级适当增加发酵烟的使用量。在目前，主要是积极推广国营长春烟厂小包发酵的先进经验。这是苏联人工发酵的先进经验在中国卷烟工厂的具体运用。根据这个经验，利用原来的发酵设备就可以提高发酵量百分之四十。控制在制品的水分、温度和车间温湿度，对提高烟支质量也有很大的作用，现在没有或缺少仪器的烟厂，应该考虑增加一些必要的仪器。
    以上事实说明，提高烟支质量，降低烟叶损耗率是完全可能的。可惜，到现在为止，有一些工厂还在空喊改进质量，长期“准备”，停滞不前。有一些烟厂单纯从增加烟丝的重量去改进质量，结果不但单箱烟叶消耗定额超过了计划指标，而且由于烟丝过多，使烟支过紧过硬。这些错误的做法都必须迅速纠正，以便保证生产品的质量，保证把质量优良的卷烟供给广大的消费者。
