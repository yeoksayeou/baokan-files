Overcoming Waste in Foreign Trade Warehousing and Transportation
Deputy Director of the Transportation Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Trade, Pang Zhijiang

　　The warehousing and transportation work of foreign trade is a very important link in the circulation process of foreign trade import and export commodities. The transportation routes of foreign trade are long. Whether by sea or land, it has to go through long-distance transportation of thousands or even tens of thousands of miles, requiring a transportation time of one to three months, and passing through the commercial ports of many countries. At the same time, most of China's foreign trade import and export materials are perishable agricultural and sideline products (fruits, meat, etc.) and easily flammable and damaged chemical raw materials or valuable precision instruments. In order to ensure that export commodities meet the quality and specification requirements of the importing countries, these commodities need to be processed, selected, sorted, packaged, and stored after being purchased from the production areas or domestic sales departments. In the entire transportation process of various commodities from all over the country to the receiving country and from foreign countries to China, various means of transportation must be changed and undergo multiple loading, unloading, and handling. A slight negligence in the work will cause errors and losses. Especially for imported valuable precision instruments, damage to one piece not only results in financial losses but also affects the progress of national construction. Another characteristic of foreign trade commodity transportation is that bulk cargo is concentrated in several ports for distribution. If the organization work is not done well, it is easy to cause cargo backlog at the ports, affecting the timely export and import of materials. Therefore, foreign trade warehousing and transportation is a very meticulous, complex, and arduous task.

　　Because there are many links in the transportation of import and export commodities, and the required expenses are also large (generally accounting for more than 60% of the entire commodity circulation cost), warehousing and transportation is the central link for the foreign trade system to improve business management.

　　Over the years, the foreign trade system has done a lot of work in determining economical transportation routes, reasonably selecting delivery ports and transportation tools, improving commodity packaging, and increasing the loading capacity of ships and vehicles, saving a lot of funds for the country. Last year alone, the national foreign trade system saved more than 60 million yuan in transportation and miscellaneous fees. However, according to our inspection, the losses and waste in the warehousing and transportation process of the foreign trade system due to poor management are still very serious. In terms of commodity storage, due to improper storage, mold, deterioration, and insect infestation are extremely serious. For example, more than 90 types of commodities, about 13,000 pieces, of the Guangzhou Native Produce Export Company suffered varying degrees of mold, deterioration, or insect infestation. The loss from persimmon cakes due to quality deterioration alone was more than 10,000 yuan. Of the more than 400 cowhides shipped from Chongqing to Shanghai for export, 90% were moldy and infested with insects. The phenomenon of stockpiling goods and packaging materials is also very serious. For example, the Tianjin Native Produce Export Company has 500,000 grass bags prepared for export that have been stockpiled for a long time. The stacking fee alone exceeds 66% of the cost of the goods. For another example, more than 200 pieces of imported automobile parts, capacitors, electric motors, copper plate drills, etc., imported by the Tianjin China Foreign Trade Transportation Corporation have been stockpiled for more than two years. In terms of commodity transportation, the losses caused by poor planning and incorrect allocation are also large. Last year alone, the National Cereals, Oils and Fats Export Company lost more than 140,000 yuan. The China Animal Husbandry Company allocated a batch of yellow weasel skins for export to the wrong location, losing about 20,000 yuan in freight. Many commodities, especially animal products and native products purchased in the inland, suffer significant losses due to poor packaging and wasted transportation capacity.

　　The reasons for the above shortcomings are, first of all, that some leaders in the foreign trade system only pay attention to completing business plans, and do not pay enough attention to how to rationally organize transportation, strengthen technical guidance, and improve business management, and practice economy in all aspects. They believe that: "Foreign trade has a large scale, complex situation, and insufficient experience. Waste is inevitable. A little waste is not a big deal, completing the state's tasks is the big thing."

　　This idea is extremely wrong. This is a manifestation of being careless about state property and not being responsible enough for the people's cause. The people entrust us with this work, and we should give full play to our high level of enthusiasm and responsibility to do our job well. Facts have proven that waste can be avoided. For example, the Tianjin Branch of the China National Cereals, Oils and Fats Export Company, in the nine months from the third quarter of 1954 to the first quarter of 1955, had 400,000 jin of ground-level grain in the warehouse, accounting for 0.23% of the operating volume. Later, after everyone came up with ideas and solutions, ensuring that broken bags do not leave the warehouse, and grain bags are not shipped until they are sewn up, and implementing a grain entry responsibility system; after that, the ground-level grain was greatly reduced. Now, for every 2 million jin of grain (10,000 bags), there are only 20 jin of ground-level grain, accounting for 0.001% of the operating volume.

　　Secondly, there is a lack of contact, cooperation, and mutual supervision and inspection systems between the relevant departments within the foreign trade system, and the cooperation between the business departments and the transportation departments is also insufficient, so that some problems cannot be discovered and resolved in a timely manner. The procedures for goods entering and leaving the warehouse are also unsound, the accounts do not match the goods, and the responsibilities are unclear, so many errors cannot be completely overcome.

　　To overcome the above shortcomings, the leaders and all employees of the foreign trade systems in all provinces and cities should do the following:

　　In terms of warehouse storage, regardless of imported or exported goods, the quality and quantity of incoming goods should be checked and accepted. Different storage methods should be adopted according to the different properties of the goods. Safety equipment such as rain protection, moisture protection, insect protection, and fire protection should be strengthened. Turning, drying, ventilation, sealing, insecticidal, disinfection, and anti-corrosion work should be done well. The storage of packaging materials should be strengthened, the stacking methods of inventory commodities should be improved, the warehouse usage area should be increased, and a regular inspection system, procedures for goods entering and leaving the warehouse, and various management systems should be established. For commodities that do not meet export specifications, contact domestic sales units immediately and quickly sell them domestically. Imported goods should be quickly allocated to production departments for use and should not be stockpiled.

　　In terms of commodity transportation, delivery ports should be selected according to the production and sales of commodities, and direct transportation should be adopted as much as possible. For domestically allocated commodities, transportation tools and transportation routes should be rationally selected according to the local geographical environment and transportation equipment conditions to reduce the transit links in the transportation of domestic and foreign import and export commodities. Transportation departments and business departments should strengthen contact, improve transportation planning, and eliminate roundabout transportation and unreasonable commodity allocation.

　　In terms of commodity packaging, while ensuring that commodities are not damaged or lost, we should think of ways to reduce packaging costs, such as saving packaging materials, selecting low-cost packaging materials, compressing packaging volume, and reducing packaging weight, so as to increase the loading capacity of ships and vehicles. In order to save packaging and other costs, we should try to adopt the methods of local procurement, local processing, local packaging, and local transportation.

　　In terms of commodity loading, unloading, and handling, we should also try to strive for methods such as picking up goods at the side of the ship or allocating goods directly from the vehicle (ship) to reduce loading, unloading, and handling links, and save loading, unloading, and handling costs. Only when every link is carefully calculated can we save more funds for the country.

　　克服对外贸易仓储运输中的浪费
　　对外贸易部运输局副局长　庞之江
    对外贸易的仓储运输工作是对外贸易进出口商品流通过程中很重要的环节。对外贸易的运输路线长，无论海运、陆运都要经过数千里甚至数万里的长途运输，需要一个月甚至三个多月的运输时间，经过许多国家的通商口岸；同时我国对外贸易进出口物资的大部分是容易腐坏的农副产品（水果、肉类等）和容易燃烧损伤的化工原料或贵重的精密仪器。为了使出口商品符合要货国家对商品质量、规格的要求，这些商品从产地或从内销部门收购过来以后，还需要加工、挑选、整理、打包、保管等。各类商品从国内各地运抵收货国家和从国外运抵国内的整个运输过程中，还要变换多种运输工具，经过多次的装卸、搬运，工作中稍有疏忽，就会造成差错和损失。特别是进口的贵重的精密仪器，损坏一件，不仅损失了资金，而且会影响国家建设的进行。对外贸易商品运输的另一特点，就是大宗货物集中在几个口岸集散，组织工作做得不好，很容易造成口岸货物积压，影响物资及时输出和运进。因此，对外贸易的仓储运输工作是一项非常细致、复杂、艰巨的工作。
    由于进出口商品在运输过程中环节较多，需要的费用也较大（一般要占整个商品流转费用的百分之六十以上），所以仓储运输工作又是对外贸易系统改善经营管理的中心环节。
    历年来，对外贸易系统在确定经济运输路线、合理选择交货口岸和运输工具、改进商品包装、提高船舶车辆装载量等方面曾做了很多工作，为国家节省了很多资金。仅去年全国对外贸易系统就节省了运杂费六千多万元。但是，根据我们的检查，目前对外贸易系统由于经营管理不善，商品在仓储运输过程中的损失、浪费还很严重。在商品储存方面，由于保管不善，霉烂、变质、生虫现象极为严重。如广州土产出口公司有九十多种约一万三千多件商品发生不同程度的霉烂、变质或生虫。其中仅柿饼因变质贬价就亏损了一万多元。由重庆运往上海准备出口的四百多张牛皮，就有百分之九十霉烂、生虫。商品和包装器材积压现象也很严重。如天津土产出口公司有五十万条准备出口的草袋长期积压，仅堆垛费就超过商品成本百分之六十六。再如天津中国对外贸易运输公司进口的汽车零件、电容器、电动器、铜板钻床等二百多件，积压竟达两年以上。在商品运输方面，由于计划不周和错拨错调造成的损失也很大，去年仅全国粮谷油脂出口公司就损失了十四万多元。中国畜产公司把出口的一批黄狼皮调错地点，损失运费约两万元。很多商品、特别是内地收购的畜产品和土产品，因包装得不好而浪费运输力量所造成的损失也很大。
    产生上述缺点的原因，首先是由于一部分对外贸易系统的领导人员只注意完成业务计划，对如何合理组织运输、加强技术指导、改善经营管理，从各方面厉行节约重视不够。他们认为：“对外贸易摊子大，情况复杂，经验不足，浪费在所难免。浪费一点半点关系不大，完成国家任务是大事。”
    这种想法是极端错误的，这是对国家资财不经心，对人民事业不够负责的表现。人民委托我们做这个工作，我们就应该发挥高度的积极性和责任心，把事情做好。事实证明，浪费是可以避免的。例如中国粮谷油脂出口公司天津分公司，从一九五四年第三季度到一九五五年第一季度九个月的时间内，仓库内发生地脚粮四十万斤，占经营量的百分之○·二三。后来，经大家出主意，想办法，保证破袋不出仓库，粮包不缝好不起运，并实行粮食进仓责任制；以后，地脚粮大大减少。现在每二○○万斤粮（一万包），只有二十斤地脚粮，占经营量的百分之○·○○一。
    其次，是对外贸易系统内部有关部门之间缺乏联系协作和相互监督检查的制度，业务部门同运输部门互相配合也不够，致使有些问题不能及时发现，及时解决。商品进出仓库的手续也不健全，账货不符，责任不清，很多错误不能彻底克服。
    要克服以上缺点，需要全国各省、市对外贸易系统的领导人员和全体职工做好以下几方面工作：
    在仓库储存工作方面，不论对进口商品或出口商品，应该做好入库商品质量数量的点验工作，根据商品不同性质采取不同的保管办法，加强防雨、防潮、防虫、消防等安全设备，做好翻堆、晾晒、通风、密闭、杀虫、消毒、防腐等工作，加强对包装器材的保管，改进库存商品的堆垛方法，提高仓库使用面积，建立定期检查制度、货物进出仓库手续和各项管理制度。对于不合出口规格的商品应该立即同内销单位联系，迅速内销。对进口商品更应该迅速拨交生产部门使用，不可积压。
    在商品运输方面，应根据商品产销情况，选择交货口岸，尽量采取直线运输。对国内调拨商品，应根据各地地理环境和交通设备情况合理选择运输工具和运输路线，减少国内外进出口商品运输的中转环节。运输部门同业务部门要加强联系，提高运输计划性，消灭迂回运输及不合理的商品调拨。
    在商品包装方面，在保证商品不受损坏、损失的条件下应多想办法降低包装费用，如节约包装用料、选用廉价包装用料及压缩包装体积，减轻包装重量，以提高船舶车辆装载量等。为了节省包装及其他费用，应该尽量采取就地收购、就地加工、就地打包、就地运出的办法。
    在商品装卸、搬运方面，也应该尽量争取船边提货或就车（船）调拨等办法来减少装卸和搬运环节，节省装卸、搬运费用。只有每一个环节都做到精打细算，才能为国家节约更多的资金。
