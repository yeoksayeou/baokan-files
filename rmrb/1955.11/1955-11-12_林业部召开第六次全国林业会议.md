The Ministry of Forestry convened the Sixth National Forestry Conference from October 21st to November 8th. The conference determined that protecting, managing, and administering existing forests, strengthening afforestation work, and improving the quality of afforestation would be the two major tasks for 1956.

In order to strengthen the protection, management, and administration of existing forests, the conference specifically requested that all localities further strengthen forest fire prevention work. During this winter and next spring's fire prevention season, it is necessary to widely mobilize the masses to actively participate in forest protection work, establish and improve fire prevention organizations, build fire prevention facilities, strictly control fire sources, and strictly prevent sabotage by counter-revolutionary elements. It was also decided that 360 new forest management stations would be established in state-owned forest areas in 1956 to specifically manage forest fire prevention, tending renewal, and forest management work. At the same time, management of private forest areas will be strengthened, and 1,200 forestry work stations will be established to be responsible for organizing and guiding the masses in forest protection, afforestation, and forest cultivation.

The conference required that the survival rate of state-owned afforestation should reach more than 90%, and the preservation rate should reach more than 85%. For forests built in the past that have not reached this target, replanting and restoration are required within the next two years. At the same time, the masses are required to improve the quality of afforestation in accordance with this spirit in future afforestation, and strive to complete the Five-Year Plan according to the preservation rate.

The conference also specifically pointed out that the speed of forestry development must be accelerated in the future, so that forestry development is adapted to the development of the entire national economy, especially the development of industry and agriculture, and strive to increase the forest area to about 30% of the land area within 30 years.

Before the end of the meeting, Vice Premier Deng Zihui came to the meeting and gave important instructions. In his instructions, he pointed out that forestry work is second only to agriculture, and is the basis for reducing and avoiding various disasters and ensuring agricultural harvests. Therefore, with the arrival of the upsurge of agricultural cooperation, we must adopt an active policy to accelerate forestry construction to meet the requirements of the development of the entire national economy. Strive to green the country's barren mountains and wastelands within 30 years, effectively control soil and water, reduce natural disasters, ensure agricultural high yields, and provide a large amount of timber for industrial construction and people's lives.

　　林业部召开第六次全国林业会议
    本报讯　林业部从十月二十一日至十一月八日召开了第六次全国林业会议。在这次会议上确定了保护、经营和管理好现有森林，加强造林工作和提高造林质量，为一九五六年两大工作任务。
    为了加强对现有森林的保护、经营和管理，会议特别要求各地进一步加强护林防火工作，在今冬明春防火季节里应广泛发动群众积极参加护林工作，建立和健全防火组织，修筑防火设施，严格控制火源，严防反革命分子的破坏。并且确定一九五六年在国有林区新建三百六十个森林经营所，来专管护林防火、抚育更新和森林管理工作。同时还要加强对私有林区管理，建立一千二百个林业工作站，来负责组织指导群众护林、造林、育林。
    会议要求国营造林的成活率要达到百分之九十以上，保存率达到百分之八十五以上。凡是过去营造的森林没有达到这个指标的，要求在今后两年内补植和重植，同时要求群众今后造林要按照这种精神提高造林质量，争取按保存率完成五年计划。
    会议还特别指出今后必须加快林业发展的速度，使林业发展同整个国民经济发展，特别是同工、农业的发展相适应，争取在三十年内把森林面积增加到国土面积的百分之三十左右。
    在会议结束前，邓子恢副总理到会做了重要指示。在指示中提出：林业工作仅次于农业，而且是减免各种灾害，保证农业丰收的基础。因而必须随着农业合作化高潮的来到，采取积极加快林业建设的方针，以适应整个国民经济发展的要求。在三十年内争取绿化全国荒山荒地，有效控制水土，减免自然灾害，保证农业丰产，并为工业建设和人民生活提供大量木材。
