America is Afraid to Face Reality
Jiang Yuanchun

At the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference on October 31st, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles stated that the United States is lifting travel restrictions for Americans to the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries. U.S. State Department Press Officer White, in announcing this U.S. action, said that this does not apply to restrictions on American travel to the People's Republic of China. In other words, the U.S. State Department will still not allow Americans to travel to China. Dulles himself said that Americans are "naturally a friendly people who are willing to understand others and be understood by others." However, the fact now proves that it is the U.S. State Department that wants to hang an iron curtain between the American and Chinese people, preventing the American people from understanding the Chinese people and being understood by the Chinese people.

White sought some so-called reasons to justify this unreasonable U.S. measure. White said that the reason the United States is doing this is that "we cannot consider approving any more U.S. citizens to enter mainland China" until all Americans "forcibly detained in the People's Republic of China" have left China.

These words of White's do not add any glory to the U.S. State Department. His so-called "forcibly detained" Americans in China refer to those Americans who have committed criminal offenses in China. There are now seventeen law-breaking Americans awaiting review and handling in accordance with Chinese legal procedures. It is quite obvious that the issue of travel between China and the United States and the issue of the Chinese government handling law-breaking American overseas Chinese in accordance with Chinese legal procedures are two completely different issues. Forcibly linking these two issues together does nothing to defend the unreasonable policies adopted by the U.S. government.

As everyone knows, the vast majority of crimes committed by Americans who break the law in China are espionage crimes. The U.S. State Department's demand that the Chinese government release them without implementing Chinese legal procedures to show "improved treatment of U.S. citizens" -- does this mean that the United States will only allow Americans to travel to China if the Chinese government does not punish Americans who come to China to engage in espionage activities? If so, how can one not suspect that the United States' lifting of travel restrictions is not really to promote understanding and friendship between the people of all countries, but has other ulterior motives.

In fact, the reason why the U.S. State Department does not allow Americans to travel to China is obvious. Many American spies who have been released have expressed sincere conviction after leaving China about the proper treatment they received, and have a profound impression of the liberated Chinese people engaged in peaceful construction. Just imagine, if a punished American spy is already like this, once the iron curtain that the United States has placed around China is broken, how inconvenient it would be for certain forces in the United States to create excuses to invade China and intensify the tense situation in the Far East if ordinary Americans understand the truth about China during their travels in China. The U.S. State Department is obviously considering the issue of restricting American travel to China from such a perspective.

In fact, it is the United States itself, not others, that should improve the treatment of foreign nationals. The tens of thousands of overseas Chinese in the United States are regarded as "third-class citizens." Many of them who wish to return to their country are still subject to all kinds of undue obstacles. However, the Chinese government has not therefore restricted the exchanges between the Chinese and American people. The Chinese people are full of confidence in their cause of peaceful construction and their great future, so they welcome people from all countries to visit China. The U.S. State Department's actions to set up iron curtains everywhere are precisely a manifestation of panic and fear of facing reality.

    美国害怕正视现实
    蒋元椿
    在十月三十一日的四国外长会议上，美国国务卿杜勒斯表示：美国正在取消美国人到苏联和东欧国家去的旅行限制。美国国务院新闻发布官怀特在宣布美国的这一行动时说，这并不适用于对美国人在中华人民共和国旅行的限制。换句话说，美国国务院将仍然不许美国人到中国来旅行。杜勒斯自己说，美国人“天然是一个友好的民族，它愿意了解别人也愿意为别人所了解”。然而现在事实证明是美国国务院要在美国和中国人民之间挂起铁幕，不让美国人民了解中国人民和被中国人民所了解。
    怀特替美国这种不合情理的措施寻找了一些所谓理由。怀特说，美国之所以这样做，是由于在所谓“被强迫拘留在中华人民共和国”的美国人全部离开中国以前，“我们不能考虑批准再有美国公民进入大陆中国”。
    怀特这些话并不能替美国国务院增加什么光彩。他的所谓“被强迫拘留”在中国的美国人，就是指的那些在中国犯有刑事罪的美国人。现在还有十七名犯法的美国人有待按照中国的法律程序审查处理。十分明显，中美两国之间旅行来往的问题，和中国政府按照中国法律程序处理犯法的美国侨民的问题，是两个性质完全不同的问题。硬把这两个问题扯到一起，一点也不能替美国政府所采取的不合理政策作辩护。
    大家知道，在中国犯法的美国人所犯的绝大部分是间谍罪行。美国国务院要求中国政府用不实施中国的法律程序就释放他们来表示“改善对美国公民的待遇”，这是不是说，只有在中国政府不惩办到中国来进行间谍活动的美国人的条件下，美国才肯让美国人到中国来旅行呢？如果是这样，那怎么能不令人发生这样的怀疑：美国解除旅行限制，并不是真正为了促进各国人民之间的了解和友好，而是另有不可告人的目的。
    其实，美国国务院不让美国人到中国来旅行的原因是一目了然的。许多已经被释放的美国间谍都在离开中国以后对于他们所受到的正当的处理表示心悦诚服，并且对于解放了的中国人民从事和平建设具有深刻的印象。试想，如果一个受到惩办的美国间谍尚且这样，一旦美国在中国周围布下的铁幕被打破，普通的美国人在旅行中国期间了解了中国的真相，这对于美国某些势力制造侵略中国的借口、在远东加剧紧张局势会有多大的不便。美国国务院显然是从这样一个角度来考虑限制美国人到中国来旅行的问题的。
    事实上，应该改善对外国侨民的待遇的不是别人，而恰恰是美国自己。在美国的数以万计的华侨被看作是“第三等公民”。他们之中许多希望回国的人一直到现在还受到种种不应有的阻挠。但是中国政府并没有因此就要限制中美两国人民之间的来往。中国人民对于自己的和平建设的事业和伟大前途充满着信心，因此欢迎各国人民到中国来访问。而美国国务院到处布置铁幕的行动，恰恰是一种惊惶失措、害怕正视现实的表现。
