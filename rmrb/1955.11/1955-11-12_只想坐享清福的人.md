　　People Who Only Want to Enjoy the Fruits of Others' Labor

　　Recently, more than one hundred provincial-level organizations in Fujian Province selected more than 500 staff members to go to the countryside to participate in the agricultural cooperation movement. The vast majority of the selected staff members went to the countryside with happy hearts. However, a small number of staff members were afraid of hardship, afraid of difficult work, and refused to go. A staff member of the Transportation Department refused to work in the countryside and even feigned illness and lay in bed. Gao Texuan, a staff member of the Fujian Provincial Pharmaceutical Company, insisted after repeated mobilization by leading comrades:
　　"I would rather be punished than go!" Why do they have such shameful ideas? It turns out that they are all people who are preparing to enjoy the fruits of socialism. Therefore, they are afraid of going to the countryside and afraid of doing difficult work.

　　This kind of person who is unwilling to go to the countryside not only exists in Fujian Province but may also exist in other regions. These people must be well-educated. The Party Committee of the directly affiliated organs of the CPC Fujian Provincial Committee has begun to pay attention to this issue, examined the shortcomings of the lack of education for the staff members of the organs in the past, and decided to carry out criticism and self-criticism in combination with these practical examples in the future to improve the socialist awareness of the staff members of the organs.

　  只想坐享清福的人
    最近，福建省一百多个省级机关抽调了五百多名工作人员下乡，参加农业合作化运动。被抽调的绝大多数工作人员都带着愉快的心情，往农村去。但也有一小部分工作人员怕吃苦，怕工作困难，不肯去。交通厅有个工作人员不肯到农村工作，居然装病躺在床上。福建省医药公司工作人员高特选，经过领导同志再三动员，还坚持：
  “宁愿受处分也不去！”为什么他们会有这样可耻的想法呢？原来他们都是准备坐享社会主义清福的人。所以他们怕到农村去，怕做困难的工作。
    这种不愿下乡的人，不但福建省有，其他地区也可能有。对于这些人必须好好教育。中共福建省委直属机关党委会已开始注意这个问题，检查了过去对于机关工作人员缺乏教育的缺点，决定今后结合这些实际事例，开展批评和自我批评，提高机关工作人员的社会主义觉悟水平。
