    State-run Sartu Ranch

    The Sartu grassland in September looks even more beautiful. The snow-white flocks of sheep are like floating clouds, moving slowly. Dairy cows of various mottled colors graze peacefully. Chestnut-colored horses gallop across the deep green grassland. The state-run Sartu Ranch is located in the center of this grassland.
    This ranch has developed rapidly in the past three years. It now has twelve sub-ranches, distributed across the grassland, which is sixty li in length and breadth with the Sartu town ranch headquarters as the center. The number of dairy cows has increased from 1,109 in 1952 to 2,595 now, and the number of sheep has increased from 1,402 to 5,676; the number of horses and the area of land have also increased significantly. It can produce more than 4,000 tons of milk and more than 17 tons of fine wool annually, supplying the needs of the country and the people. It can also produce thousands of dairy cows, sheep, and horses to supply newly built ranches, farms, and agricultural producers' cooperatives to develop animal husbandry.
    This ranch uses the best dairy cow breeds aided by the Soviet Union - Yaroslavl bulls, excellent Ardennes stallions, and Soviet Merino and Caucasian sheep to improve livestock quality. In addition, by using the Soviet Union's advanced breeding and feeding management experience, the output has increased significantly. The average annual milk production per adult dairy cow has increased from 4,977 jin in 1952 to 5,380 jin in 1954, and the average annual wool production per sheep has increased from six jin and one liang in 1952 to seven jin and nine liang.
    A newly built and well-equipped dairy farm at the state-run Sartu Ranch that can accommodate 600 dairy cows has been completed, and many sub-ranches are under construction and expansion. The state's first five-year plan requires that by the end of 1957, this ranch will have 5,000 dairy cows, 12,000 sheep, and 1,700 horses, and land serving animal husbandry will reach 6,000 hectares. At that time, it will produce 6,000 tons of milk and 48 tons of fine wool annually to support national construction. The livestock produced annually will be able to equip a dairy farm with 800 breeding dairy cows and a sheep farm with 3,000 breeding ewes. At the same time, it will cultivate more breeding cattle, horses, and sheep to supply farms and rural areas to improve livestock quality, in order to improve agricultural production and develop animal husbandry. Now all the staff of the ranch are working with unparalleled excitement and confidence to achieve this plan.

    国营萨尔图牧场
    郭克
    九月里的萨尔图草原显得更美丽了，雪白的羊群像一朵朵的浮云，慢慢移动着。各样的斑花的乳牛，安详地吃着草。枣红色的大马奔驰在深绿色的草原上，国营萨尔图牧场就设立在这个草原的中心。
    这个牧场近三年来有飞跃的发展，现在有十二个分场，分布在以萨尔图镇牧场总场部为中心的纵横六十里方圆的草原上。乳牛由一九五二年的一千一百零九头增加到现在的二千五百九十五头，绵羊由一千四百零二只增加到五千六百七十六只；马匹、土地也都增加很多。一年中可生产四千多吨牛乳和十七吨多细羊毛，供给国家和人民生活需要。还可以生产数以千计的乳牛、绵羊、马匹，供给各地新建牧场、农场和农业生产合作社发展畜牧事业。
    这个牧场由于使用苏联帮助的最好的乳牛品种——亚罗斯拉夫种公牛、优良的阿尔登种马和苏联美利奴、高加索种羊来改良畜质，加上运用了苏联先进的繁殖和饲养管理经验，因而生产量有显著的增加，平均每头成乳牛年产奶量由一九五二年的四千九百七十七斤，增加到一九五四年的五千三百八十斤，平均每只绵羊年产毛量从一九五二年的六斤一两增加到七斤九两。
    国营萨尔图牧场一处新建的设备完善，能容纳六百头奶牛的奶牛场已经竣工，不少分场正在兴工扩建。国家第一个五年计划要求，这个牧场到一九五七年末乳牛达到五千头，绵羊一万二千只，马一千七百匹，为畜牧服务的土地达到六千垧地。到那时，每年将生产六千吨牛奶和四十八吨细羊毛，支援国家建设。每年生产的牲畜，调出将可装备一个拥有八百头繁殖乳牛的乳牛场，和三千只繁殖母羊的绵羊场。同时将培养出更多的种牛、种马、种羊供给农场和农村改良畜质，以便提高农业生产和发展畜牧事业。现在全场职工都以无比的兴奋心情和信心为实现这个计划而努力。
