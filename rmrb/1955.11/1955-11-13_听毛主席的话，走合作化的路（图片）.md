After studying Comrade Mao Zedong's "Report on the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" and the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's "Resolution on the Question of Agricultural Cooperation," the vast number of peasants are advancing on the road of cooperativization with even greater confidence.
