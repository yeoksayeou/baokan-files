Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, November 24th: Jiangxi Province will basically achieve semi-socialist agricultural cooperativization by the autumn of 1956. This decision was made at the enlarged meeting of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held from the 21st to the 22nd. The meeting anticipates that Jiangxi Province can basically achieve complete socialist agricultural cooperativization by 1962.

After heated discussions, the enlarged meeting of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party unanimously held that the high tide of the agricultural cooperativization movement has already formed in the vast majority of rural areas of Jiangxi Province. Among the 3.6 million rural working people's households (poor peasants, middle peasants, and other working people) in the province, 700,000 peasant households have already joined agricultural production cooperatives, and at least 1.1 million more households are actively applying to join, and the number is constantly increasing. At present, in addition to the relatively rapid development of the agricultural cooperativization movement in the plains and hilly areas of northeastern and central Jiangxi, farmers in many mountainous areas of southwestern and northwestern Jiangxi have also enthusiastically joined this movement. In the cradle of the revolution—the Jinggang Mountains area—50 percent of the peasant households have now joined agricultural production cooperatives. The hometown of martyr Fang Zhimin—Qigong Township in Yiyang County—is also a mountainous area, and it will basically achieve semi-socialist agricultural cooperativization this winter.

The enlarged meeting of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party pointed out that there are a large number of existing agricultural production cooperatives in the province as examples, 300,000 mutual aid teams as the foundation for establishing cooperatives, more than 98 percent of townships have CCP branches, and there are more than 1 million farmer backbone and activists. Therefore, it is entirely possible for Jiangxi Province to organize more than 50 percent of peasant households to join cooperatives this winter and spring. If these cooperatives are run well and increase production, it is entirely possible to basically achieve semi-socialist cooperativization in the province's rural areas next autumn.

The meeting requested that Party organizations at all levels throughout the province further comprehensively implement the Party's guidelines and policies in leading the agricultural cooperativization movement so that the development of agricultural production cooperatives will not only reach a sufficient quantity but also ensure good quality. In order to strengthen its leadership over the agricultural cooperativization movement, the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has decided to send responsible comrades of the Provincial Committee in rotation to go deep into the countryside to inspect and supervise the work recently.

### 江西省明年秋天将基本上实现农业合作化

　　江西省明年秋天将基本上实现农业合作化
    新华社南昌二十四日电　江西省将在一九五六年秋天基本上实现半社会主义的农业合作化。这是在二十一日到二十二日举行的中共江西省委员会扩大会议上作出的决定。会议预计：江西省到一九六二年可以基本上实现完全社会主义的农业合作化。
    中共江西省委员会扩大会议经过热烈讨论后一致认为：目前江西省农村绝大多数地区农业合作化运动的高潮已经形成。全省农村劳动人民（贫农、中农和其他劳动人民）共有三百六十万户，现在参加农业生产合作社的农户已经有七十万户，正在积极申请入社的至少也有一百一十多万户，并且还在不断地增加。现在，全省除赣东北、赣中等平原和丘陵地带的农业合作化运动发展比较快以外，赣西南、赣西北不少山区的农民也热火朝天地卷入了这个运动。革命摇篮——井冈山区，现在已经有百分之五十的农户参加了农业生产合作社。方志敏烈士的故乡——弋阳县漆工乡也是一个山区，这里今年冬季就要基本上实现半社会主义的农业合作化。
    中共江西省委员会扩大会议指出，全省农村中有大批原有的农业生产合作社做榜样，有三十万个互助组做建社基础，百分之九十八以上的乡有了中共支部，还有一百多万名农民中的骨干和积极分子。因此，江西省今冬明春组织百分之五十以上的农户入社，是完全可以办到的。这些社办得好，增了产，明年秋季在全省农村中基本上实现半社会主义合作化，也是完全可能的。
    会议要求全省各级党组织在领导农业合作化运动中，要进一步全面地贯彻执行党的方针和政策，使农业生产合作社的发展既要达到足够的数量，又要保证良好的质量。中共江西省委为了加强对农业合作化运动的领导，已经决定在最近派遣省委各负责人轮流深入农村巡视检查工作。
