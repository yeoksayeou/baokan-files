A noble quality of a socialist new person is not only manifested in selfless work attitude and patriotism for the motherland but also in his correct attitude towards love and family. The latter can accurately test a person's moral character on certain key issues. If a person loses the socialist qualities in this regard, he will sooner or later expose his true colors in the entire labor and social activities. Therefore, revealing a person's spiritual outlook from love and family relationships, opposing the remnants of capitalism in people's ideology, and educating the people with lofty communist moral principles have become the glorious mission of literature and art. The Soviet film "Marina's Fate" reflects this struggle and unfolds real and dramatic conflicts through vivid characters with mutually opposing moral qualities.

This conflict is mainly expressed through the characters of Marina, a working woman in a collective farm, and her husband, Terenty. Marina is a hardworking member of the collective farm. She works diligently and studies hard. In order to increase the production and sugar content of the farm’s sugar beets, she studies science and technology with a level of knowledge worse than her daughter's. She understands that in the vigorous development of reality, rich scientific knowledge is a necessary condition for building socialism. It is precisely for this reason that she uses her labor income to help her husband enter university. In the family, Marina is an exemplary wife and mother. She is pure in heart, has beautiful life ideals, and loves her husband and daughter.

However, her husband, Terenty, is completely different. His mind is full of egoistic plans and a fervent pursuit of vanity. His pursuit of knowledge is only to climb to the so-called position of "agriculturalist" and "scholar." In order to achieve his ugly goals, he betrayed his love for his wife and pursued the female reporter Xenia at school, attempting to gain the promotion of Xenia's father as a result. This person with a dirty soul and despicable behavior even flaunts his Latin knowledge in front of his wife, calling himself "Homo" - a human being. If he is like this in the moral qualities of private life, then it is impossible not to expose his ugly face in work and labor. In the past, when he worked in the farm, he was just a person who only knew how to talk big. Later, in scientific research work, he was still a liar who only knew how to talk about "scientific papers."

Terenty graduated from the Agricultural College. He was unwilling to stay and work in the farm, believing that the farm was not enough to display his abilities. The face of this fanatical egoist was completely exposed. He "abandoned" Marina, feeling that he was "spiritually" "higher" than his wife. He became an agriculturalist, while his wife was still pulling sugar beets, "still stuck in the same place." In this way, he left the farm and left Marina.

The storm of life suddenly struck Marina. She was painfully and lonely locked in her own house. However, Soviet women are no longer "educated for thousands of years as toys for venting sexual desire and domestic animals who can play the role of 'housewife'". They are equal to men in Soviet society and have "successfully demonstrated their various talents and vast labor capacity" (Gorky). They are independent people. Marina did not indulge in pain for long. The Party gave her the strength to start a new life. Under the education of the Party, she buried the pain in her heart, became strong, and devoted herself wholeheartedly to the collective cause. For the collective, and with the help of the Party and the collective, she created amazing achievements in increasing sugar beet production and became a true agriculturalist.

More importantly, she grew spiritually and freed herself from the burden of personal suffering. When she saw Terenty for the last time, she solemnly told him: "I am used to walking, I don't need you to see me off," "I now treat you like a patient, hoping you get well soon." And Terenty, who boasted of being a "Homo" with a noble "soul," is just like Xenia said: "Even if you can deceive all of us, you can't deceive life. She will force you to return to the right path, or throw you aside like useless waste."

"A person should be judged according to his behavior, what he is looking for, and what he is pursuing in life." Marina teaches her daughter this way. The new generation will never repeat their mother's mistakes.

The film also interweaves another conflict, which is the conflict between collective laborers and the remnants of petty-private capitalism among the farm members. The young and strong Matvey, since marrying Motrena, has been at home all day doing housework with his wife, becoming a selfish and lazy person, almost losing the excellent qualities of a laborer. In order to save him, the Party launched a warm criticism of him by the farm members. In the fierce ideological struggle, Matvey felt his own shame and enthusiastically threw himself into the collective cause, and influenced Motrena's transformation.

The film portrays these two groups of opposing characters with vivid and realistic artistic images, revealing the character of noble Soviet people like Marina from the inner spiritual world of the characters. She is strong, brave, pure in heart, loves the collective, and loves life. Therefore, although she has suffered storms in life, because her personal destiny is always integrated with the collective and the cause of communism, the tragedy in her personal life has not overwhelmed her, but has made her grow up in pain; while Terenty, who pursues personal vanity away from the collective, has not only failed to cheat the glorious title of so-called "agriculturalist" and "scholar," but has lost all the happiness in life. Matvey and Motrena, only by breaking away from the vulgar quagmire of selfishness and self-interest, can they gain true happiness in the collective cause. These two groups of opposing characters fully show how the socialist system of common labor and ideological unity has helped people to develop the beautiful and noble side of their character, and how the remnants of capitalist ideology based on selfishness and self-interest have prevented people from pursuing a better life, damaged people's true feelings, and led people's spiritual life into a mean, dirty dead end.

The film is very successful artistically. The author unfolds this profound conflict with sharply contrasting shots. The contrasting descriptions of Marina and Terenty's different lives after separation, although only a few short shots, give the audience a clear and vivid impression of these two characters. There are also some extremely concise shots, but they are full of profound meaning. For example, after the chairman of the collective farm, Gnat, clearly understood all of Terenty's despicable plans, he blew off the ashes of the wheat ears crushed in his palm. This short shot fully shows Gnat's loyal character, his hatred for Terenty's despicable soul, and also shows that in the collective cause, such human ashes will be cleared out. The language of the film is also refined. The author uses many dialogues with double meanings, which plays a great role in enriching the details of the film, strengthening the characters' personalities, and revealing the characters' spiritual world to the audience more deeply. For example, the author's description of Terenty repeatedly talking about the issues of "spirit" and "soul" is particularly comical in portraying the character of this egoist, deeply exposing the emptiness of his soul in front of the audience. The conversation between the Party branch secretary and Marina in front of the window on a stormy night, from the natural thunderstorm metaphor to the thunderstorms in people's lives, vividly illustrates the truth of how a socialist new person should face the twists and turns of life, and deeply educated Marina. There are many other such poetic shots that have left a vivid impression on the audience.

In terms of the actors' acting skills, the outstanding achievement is, of course, that of E. Litvinenko, the actor playing Marina. She truthfully and delicately conveyed the changes in Marina's inner thoughts and feelings and the actions embodied in her appearance. This makes Marina, this beautiful typical Soviet woman, possess a charming charm. Only by deeply understanding the complex emotional changes of her heroine in unfortunate encounters, and deeply understanding the preciousness of true human love, can she be shaped so perfectly. The actor Boris Andreyev, who plays the lazy Matvey, is very familiar to us. We have seen him play various characters in films such as "The Fall of Berlin", and they are all very successful. In this film, he has made new achievements in the portrayal of Matvey. His consummate acting skills portray this temporarily lost simple character very delicately. The acting skills of R. Bykov, the actor playing the young man Sashko, are also very successful. R. Bykov fully grasped this humorous and lively character. He showed his loyalty and seriousness to love through laughter, and his love for life and courage to move forward optimistically in the collective cause through humor. In short, the artistic achievements of the film and the re-embodiment of the actors have powerfully enriched the theme of the work.

The film "Marina's Fate" has profound educational significance for us. In our lives, there are still many ugly phenomena that should be lashed out at. People still have many wrong attitudes and behaviors in dealing with love and family life, making family relations a mess. There are also many people who, when faced with storms in life, do not bravely stand up like Marina, but are pessimistic, disappointed, and even commit suicide. These phenomena in socialist construction and in the construction of socialist people must be criticized and eliminated. (Attached picture)

    崇高而优美的妇女形象
    ——谈苏联影片“玛利娜的命运”

    编剧：莉吉雅·柯玛巴妮茨　导演：依·史麻鲁克、符·依夫琴柯

    一个社会主义新人的高贵品质，不仅表现在忘我的劳动态度和为祖国服务的爱国主义精神上，同样也表现在他对于爱情和家庭的正确态度上。后者在一定的关键问题上也能准确地考验一个人的道德品质。如果一个人在这方面丧失了社会主义的品质，他迟早会在整个劳动和社会活动中，暴露出他的本质面貌的。因此，从爱情和家庭关系中揭示一个人的精神面貌，反对人们思想意识里的资本主义残余，以崇高的共产主义道德原则教育人民，也就成了文学艺术的光辉使命。苏联影片“玛利娜的命运”，就正是通过了有着互相对立的道德品质的活的性格，反映了这个斗争，展开了真实的富有戏剧性的冲突。
    这个冲突，主要是通过集体农庄劳动妇女玛利娜和他的丈夫杰连季的性格表现出来。玛利娜是个勤劳的集体农庄庄员，她勤恳地工作着，学习着，为了提高农庄甜菜的生产量和含糖量，她以比她女儿还差的知识水平，钻研科学技术。她懂得在现实蓬勃的发展里，丰富的科学知识是建设社会主义所必需的一个条件。正是因为这个缘故，她才以自己的劳动收入，帮助丈夫进入大学学习。在家庭里，玛利娜是模范的妻子和母亲，她心地纯洁，有着美好的生活理想，热爱自己的丈夫和女儿。
    但是，她的丈夫杰连季却完全不同，在他的脑子里充满了利己主义的打算和追求虚荣的狂热。他的追求知识，只是为了爬到所谓“农业家”“学者”的位子上去。为了达到他丑恶的目的，他背弃了对妻子的爱情，在学校里追求女记者席妮雅，企图因此得到席妮雅父亲的提拔。这个灵魂肮脏、行为卑鄙的人物，却居然还要在妻子面前炫耀自己的拉丁文知识，自称为“霍莫”——人。在私人生活的道德品质上是如此，在工作和劳动中，也就不可能不暴露他的丑恶面貌。过去在农庄里工作，他是个只会夸夸其谈的人物，后来在科学研究工作上，他也仍然是一个空谈“科学论文”的骗子。
    杰连季在农业学院毕业了。他不愿留在农庄里工作，认为农庄不足以施展他的能力。这个狂热的利己主义者的面目完全暴露了。他“抛弃”了玛利娜，觉得自己“精神”上比妻子“高”多了，他成了农业家，而妻子还在那里拔甜菜，“仍旧停在老地方”。就这样，他离开了农庄，离开了玛利娜。
    生活中的暴风雨，突然地袭击了玛利娜。她痛苦地孤独地关在自己的房子里。可是，苏联的妇女已经不是几千年来“被教养作发泄性欲的玩具和可以扮演‘主妇’的家庭动物”，她们在苏维埃的社会里同男子是平等的，并且“成功地证明了自己的各样的禀赋和广大的劳动能力”（高尔基），她们是独立的人。玛利娜并没有长久地沉浸在痛苦里，党给了她重新生活的力量。在党的教育下，她把痛苦埋藏在自己心里，坚强起来了，全身心地投到集体事业中去。为了集体，也是在党和集体的帮助之下，她创造了提高甜菜产量的惊人业绩，成了真正的农业家。
    而更主要的是，她在精神上成长了，她摆脱了个人痛苦遭遇的负担。当她最后一次见到杰连季的时候，就严肃地告诉他：“我已经习惯走路，不用你送了”，“我现在对你的态度像对病人一样，希望你赶快好起来”。而杰连季，这个自许为“灵魂”高尚的“霍莫”，正像席妮雅所说的：“即使你能欺骗我们大家，可是，生活，你欺骗不了，她要强制你回到正确的路上来，或者像无用的废物把你扔在一边。”
    “判断一个人应当根据他的行为，他在找什么，他在生活里追求什么。”玛利娜这样教育着自己的女儿。新的一代决不再重复妈妈的错误了。
    影片中还交织着另一冲突，那就是在农庄庄员中集体劳动者同小私有资本主义残余的冲突。年轻力壮的马特维，自从同莫特连雅结婚后，就整天和老婆钻在家务里面，变成了自私自利的怠工懒汉，几乎丧失了一个劳动者的优秀品质。党为了挽救他，发动了庄员们对他进行热烈的批评。在激烈的思想斗争里，马特维感到了自己的可耻，又热情地投入到集体事业中来，并且影响了莫特连雅的转变。
    影片以鲜明的真实的艺术形象，塑造了这两组对立的性格，从人物内在的精神世界里，揭示出像玛利娜那样的高尚的苏维埃人的性格。她坚强，勇敢，心地纯洁，热爱集体，热爱生活，所以虽然遭受到生活中的暴风雨，由于她个人的命运始终是同集体、同共产主义事业融合在一起，因此，她个人生活上的悲剧，并没有压倒她，反而使她在痛苦中成长起来了；而脱离集体追求个人虚荣的杰连季，却不仅没有骗取到所谓“农业家”“学者”的光荣称号，反而丧失了生活中的一切幸福。马特维和莫特连雅，只有脱离了庸俗的自私自利的泥坑，才在集体事业中获得了真正的幸福。这两组对立的性格，充分显示出以共同劳动和思想上团结一致的社会主义制度，是怎样帮助了人们发扬性格中美好和崇高的一面，而以自私自利为基础的资本主义思想残余，是怎样妨碍了人们去追求美好的生活，损害了人们真实的感情，把人们的精神生活导入卑污、肮脏的绝境。
    影片在艺术上是非常成功的。作者用鲜明对照的镜头，展开了这个深刻的冲突。玛利娜和杰连季两人在分居后不同的生活的对照描写，虽然是短短的几个镜头，却使观众对这两个性格获得清晰鲜明的印象。也有一些极其简练的镜头，却富有深刻的意义。像集体农庄主席葛那特在听清楚杰连季一切卑鄙的计划后，把捏碎在掌心里的麦穗的灰屑吹掉。这个短短的镜头，充分显示出葛那特忠实的性格，对于杰连季这个卑鄙灵魂的憎恨，也表明了在集体事业中，这样的人类的灰屑，是会被清除出去的。影片的语言也是精炼的。作者运用了许多富有双关意义的对话，这对于丰富影片细节，强化人物性格，更深地向观众揭露人物的精神世界，起了很大作用。例如作者描写杰连季一再谈到“精神”和“灵魂”的问题，对这个利己主义者的性格的刻划，特别具有喜剧的效果，在观众面前，深刻地暴露了他灵魂的空虚。党支部书记和玛利娜在暴风雨之夜的窗前谈话，从自然的雷雨隐喻到人们生活中的雷雨，生动地说明了一个社会主义新人应当如何面对生活波折的真理，深刻地教育了玛利娜。还有很多这样富有诗意的镜头，都给观众留下了鲜明的印象。
    在演员的演技上，获得杰出成就的，当然是玛利娜的扮演者叶·李特维念科。她把玛利娜内在的思想感情的变化和体现到外形的动作，都真实地细腻地传达出来了。使得玛利娜这个优美的苏联妇女典型，富有一种迷人的魅力。这只有深刻理解了自己的女主人公在不幸遭遇中复杂的感情变化，深刻理解人类真纯爱情的可贵，才能把她塑造得这样完美。饰懒汉马特维的演员鲍里斯·安德列夫，对我们是非常熟悉的。我们从“攻克柏林”等影片中，看到他扮演各种性格的角色，都是非常成功的。在这部影片中，他对于马特维的塑造，又有了新的成就。他的纯熟的演技，把这个暂时迷路的朴实性格，刻划得非常细腻。小伙子沙司柯的演员尔·贝柯夫的演技也是很成功的。尔·贝柯夫充分掌握了这个幽默而活泼的性格。从欢笑里表现了他对爱情的忠诚和严肃，从诙谐里表现了他对生活的热爱，对集体事业充满乐观前进的勇气。总之，影片在艺术上的成就和演员的再体现，都非常有力地丰富了作品的主题。
    影片“玛利娜的命运”，对我们是有深刻的教育意义的。在我们的生活里，也还有着许多应当受到鞭挞的丑恶现象。人们在对待爱情和家庭生活方面，还有许多错误的态度和行为，把家庭关系弄得乱七八糟。也有许多人在遭受到生活上的暴风雨的时候，不是像玛利娜那样勇敢地站起来，而是悲观失望甚至自杀。这些现象在社会主义建设中，在社会主义的人的建设中，是完全有必要加以批判和扫除的。（附图片）
