Xinhua News Agency, 6th. The newly appointed Ambassador of the Republic of India to the People's Republic of China, R.K. Nehru, accompanied by Counselor Bahadur Singh, Military Attaché Brigadier Malik, and other diplomats, presented his credentials to Zhu De, Vice Chairman of the People's Republic of China, on the afternoon of the 6th. Present were Zhang Wentian, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China; Yu Xinqing, Director of the Protocol Department of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress; Chen Jiakang, Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs and Director of the Asian Affairs Department; and Ke Hua, Director of the Protocol Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

When presenting his credentials, Ambassador R.K. Nehru delivered a speech, and Vice Chairman Zhu De delivered a reply.

Ambassador R.K. Nehru's speech:
Mr. Vice Chairman:

I am honored to present to Your Excellency my credentials and to convey the warm and sincere greetings of the President of India.

The mission I have accepted is to promote friendship, understanding, and cooperation between our two countries. Your Excellency, I consider it an honor to accept this mission.

Together, our two great nations represent one-third of the world's population. This fact gives our relationship great significance to the whole world.

For more than twenty years, this relationship has been built on friendship and mutual understanding. Religious and cultural ties have developed between our two countries, and for centuries, they have engaged in peaceful exchanges of ideas and other forms of friendly interaction. Then came a period of separation caused by external forces. This situation has fortunately ended, and since the emergence of the new India and the new China, the governments and peoples of our two countries have been engaged in the great work of restoring ancient contacts and strengthening friendly ties. On April 29, 1954, our two governments reached an agreement on trade and traffic between India and the Tibet region of China. This agreement is an outstanding example of the application of "Panchsheel," the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, in our mutual relations. These five principles were reaffirmed in the joint statement issued by Prime Minister Nehru and Premier Zhou Enlai in New Delhi on June 28, 1954. This has greatly helped to create an atmosphere of peace and promote good-neighborly relations between our two countries. These principles have been accepted by many of our neighbors and many other countries in Asia and beyond. At the historic Bandung Conference earlier this year, these principles were also supported by the peoples of Asia and Africa. These significant developments have been brought about by our joint efforts to promote peace and ease tensions. We have set an example for other countries in the world of peaceful coexistence and good-neighborly relations. One of the strong bonds between our two countries is a common desire for peace. This desire stems from our belief that peace is good in itself and, in the circumstances we face today, is essential. We live in this nuclear age, and there is no practical alternative to peace. For our internal construction, development, and the promotion of the well-being of our people, we need peace. Our efforts in our respective countries are all directed towards this great work, and following this common goal will bring our two countries closer to each other in all respects. As India's representative in China, I will work earnestly and consistently to strengthen this trend. The friendly relations and cooperation between the governments and peoples of our two countries, based on the five principles, will be an important factor in promoting peace throughout the world. In fulfilling my mission, I earnestly hope to receive the support of Your Excellency and Your Excellency's government.

Vice Chairman Zhu De's reply:
Mr. Ambassador:

I am very pleased to accept the credentials presented by Your Excellency, granted by the President of the Republic of India, and I thank Your Excellency for the congratulations. Over the past five years, friendly cooperation between China and India has made significant progress. Economic and cultural ties are becoming increasingly close. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, jointly initiated by the two countries, are being accepted by more and more countries in the world and are having an increasingly profound impact. Friendly cooperation between China and India, as two major Asian countries, has become a tremendous force for maintaining and consolidating peace in Asia and the world. I believe that with Your Excellency's efforts, this friendly cooperation between China and India will be further developed.

Mr. Ambassador, I warmly welcome Your Excellency as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Republic of India to the People's Republic of China. In your work to develop friendly cooperation between China and India and to safeguard international peace, the Government of the People's Republic of China will provide full assistance.

I wish your country prosperity and your people well-being, and I wish your head of state good health.

    印度新任驻我国大使拉·库·尼赫鲁
    向朱德副主席递交国书
    新华社六日讯  印度共和国新任驻中华人民共和国特命全权大使拉·库·尼赫鲁在六日下午偕参赞巴哈杜尔·辛格、武官马立克准将等外交官向中华人民共和国朱德副主席递交国书。在场的有中华人民共和国外交部副部长张闻天，全国人民代表大会常务委员会典礼局局长余心清，外交部部长助理兼亚洲司司长陈家康、礼宾司司长柯华。
    递交国书时，拉·库·尼赫鲁大使致颂词，朱德副主席致答词。
    拉·库·尼赫鲁大使的颂词副主席先生：
    我荣幸地向阁下递交我的国书并转达印度总统热烈的和诚挚的祝贺。
    我所接受的使命是要促进我们两国之间的友谊、谅解和合作。阁下，我认为接受这一使命是一件光荣的事。
    我们两个伟大的国家一起代表了世界人口的三分之一。这一事实使我们的关系对全世界说来是具有重大意义的。
    二十多年来，这种关系是建立在友好和相互一致的基础上的。宗教和文化的联系曾在我们两国之间获得发展，而且几世纪以来，它们之间曾进行着思想上的和平交流和其他形式的友好往来。接着是由于外来力量所造成的彼此隔离的一个时期。这种情况已幸运地结束了，并且自从新印度和新中国出现以来，我们两国政府和人民一直在从事着恢复古老的接触和增强友好联系的巨大工作。一九五四年四月二十九日，我们两国政府就有关印度和中国西藏地方的通商和交通问题达成了协议。这个协定是在我们相互的关系中应用“潘奇雪拉”即和平共处的五项原则的一个杰出的范例。一九五四年六月二十八日尼赫鲁总理和周恩来总理在新德里发表的联合声明中重申了这五项原则。这大大地有助于创立和平的气氛和促进我们两国间的睦邻关系。这些原则被我们许多伟大的邻邦和其他亚洲及亚洲以外的许多国家所接受了。今年年初在万隆举行的具有历史意义的会议上，这些原则亦受到了亚洲和非洲人民的支持。这些重大的发展，是我们为促进和平和缓和紧张局势所作的共同努力而促成的。我们为世界上其他的国家树立了和平共处和睦邻关系的榜样。我们两国间牢固的联系之一是对和平的共同愿望。这种愿望系出自我们这个信念：和平本身是好的，而且在我们今天所面临的情况下，是十分必要的。我们生存于这个核子世纪中，除和平外，没有其他实际的选择。为了我们内部的建设、发展和促进我们人民的福利，我们需要和平。我们在各自的国家中所作的努力都是为了这一伟大的工作，遵循这个共同的目标，就会在各方面使我们两国彼此更加亲近。作为印度在中国的代表，我将热切地和一贯地为加强这种趋势而努力。我们两国政府和人民在五项原则基础上的友好关系和合作将是在全世界促进和平的一个重要因素。在履行我的使命时，我热切地期望能得到阁下以及阁下的政府的支持。朱德副主席的答词大使先生：我很高兴地接受贵大使递交的印度共和国总统所授予的国书，并感谢贵大使的祝贺。过去五年多来，中印两国之间的友好合作有了显著的发展。经济上和文化上的联系正在日益密切。两国共同倡议的和平共处的五项原则正为世界上越来越多的国家所接受，并且产生着日益深远的影响。作为亚洲两大国家的中国和印度间的友好合作已成为维护和巩固亚洲和世界和平的巨大力量。我相信，在贵大使的努力下，中印两国的这种友好合作必将获得进一步的发展。
    大使先生，我热烈地欢迎阁下出任印度共和国驻中华人民共和国的特命全权大使。在您为发展中印两国友好合作和维护国际和平的工作中，中华人民共和国政府将予以充分的协助。
    谨祝贵国国家繁荣，人民兴旺，并祝贵国元首健康。
