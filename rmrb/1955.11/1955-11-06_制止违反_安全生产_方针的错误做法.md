    Editor's Note: The following three reader letters expose situations in some factories and mines where production tasks are completed through shock work, leading to frequent personal and equipment accidents. As 1955 draws to a close, factories and mines are striving to fulfill and exceed their annual production plans. During this period, there is a high risk of neglecting safety in the rush to increase production. Therefore, the issues raised by these readers deserve widespread attention. We hope that leading personnel in all factories and mines will resolutely implement the "safe production" policy, strengthen labor and equipment protection in all aspects, reduce and eliminate personal and equipment accidents, and ensure the comprehensive completion of production plans.

    制止违反“安全生产”方针的错误做法
    编者按：下面发表的三篇读者来信，揭露了某些厂矿企业用突击手段来完成生产任务，以致不断发生人身和设备事故的情况。现在一九五五年度快结束了，各个厂矿企业正在为完成和超额完成年度生产计划而努力。在这个期间内，最容易发生为了突击生产而忽视安全的偏向。因此，读者反映的情况就值得引起普遍的重视。希望各厂矿企业的领导工作人员坚决执行“安全生产”的方针，从各方面来加强劳动和设备的保护工作，减少并杜绝人身和设备事故，保证全面地完成生产计划。
