　　The Datong Engineering Section of the Beijing-Baotou Railway, although it also formulated a plan for increasing production and practicing economy, failed to earnestly implement the various stipulated systems. As a result, overspending and waste were very serious. For example, in the replacement of railway mainline and station track accessories, the original plan was to save 11,274 yuan; however, because no one was responsible for overseeing it, not only were there no savings, but there was an overexpenditure of more than 7,000 yuan. Due to the unnecessary distribution of more than 1,500 kilograms of iron wire to various work areas, transportation costs were also overspent by 3,498 yuan.
　　However, in the report submitted to the leading body, this factory stated that they had overfulfilled the savings plan by 28.6 percent in the third quarter, saving the state 33,680 yuan.
　　What "magical" method did they use to "overfulfill" the savings plan? It turned out that they calculated the 10,133 yuan saved from the difference between the planned wage value and the actual wage as savings, the 3,891 yuan in material costs saved from not completing the task of bundling sleepers as savings, and the temporarily unpaid bonuses and material payments as savings. In addition, they also used the method of reducing the quality of railway maintenance to save money. For example, in the third quarter, of the 90 kilometers of railway they maintained, only one kilometer was rated excellent, and 13 kilometers were rated good.
　　This kind of false saving cannot increase state revenue, nor can it urge enterprises to improve their work, but can only play a self-deceptive role. However, is the purpose of carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy in factories and mines to deceive oneself?

### 自欺欺人的“节约”

　  自欺欺人的“节约”
    京包铁路大同工务段虽然也订出了增产节约的计划，但是没有认真贯彻实现各项规定的制度，结果，超支、浪费的现象非常严重。例如，在更换铁路正线和站线配件方面，按照原订计划，将可以节约一万一千二百七十四元；可是，因为没人负责掌握，不仅没有节约，反而超支了七千多元。由于不必要地把一千五百多公斤铁丝分送到各工区去，也超支运输费三千四百九十八元。
    但是，在这个厂给领导机关的报告中却说他们在第三季度超额完成节约计划百分之二十八点六，给国家节约了三万三千六百八十元。
    他们用什么“神奇”的办法来“超额”完成节约计划的呢？原来，他们把计划工资分值高于实际的差额所节余的一万零一百三十三元算作了节约，把没有完成捆扎枕木任务节余下来的三千八百九十一元材料费也算作了节约，把暂没付出的奖金、料款等也算作了节约。另外，他们还用减低线路维修质量的办法来节约。如第三季度内，他们维修的九十公里铁路中，只有一公里优良，十三公里良好。
    这种虚假的节约，既不能给国家增加收入，又不能督促企业改进工作，而只能起一种自欺欺人的作用。但是，在厂矿企业里开展增产节约运动，难道是为了自欺欺人吗？
