The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has achieved a bumper harvest of sugar beets on the 110,000 mu planted this year. Preliminary estimates suggest yields of over 3,000 jin per mu, with some reaching over 10,000 jin. The Red Star Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Hohhot achieved an average yield of over 8,000 jin per mu on 300 mu of sugar beets. Currently, farmers have begun harvesting the sugar beets to support the start of production at the state-owned Baotou Sugar Factory. In Orge'erqin Township, Siziwang Banner, 390 women have organized 22 sugar beet trimming groups and are engaged in a trimming competition. Members of the Red Star Agricultural Cooperative and the Second Agricultural Cooperative of Dongtan Township in Zhuozi County are cleaning the sugar beets of their fibrous roots and scraping off the mud, ensuring that the sugar beet clumps are delivered cleanly to the sugar factory.

　  内蒙古自治区甜菜丰收
    内蒙古自治区今年种植的十一万亩甜菜获得丰收，据初步估计，每亩在三千斤以上，有的竟达一万多斤。呼和浩特郊区红星农业合作社三百亩甜菜平均在八千多斤以上。目前，农民们已开始收获甜菜，支援国营包头糖厂开工生产。萨拉齐县鄂尔格逊镇三百九十名妇女组织了二十二个削甜菜小组，并展开切削竞赛。卓资县红星农业合作社和东滩乡第二农业合作社的社员们把甜菜上的虚根削净，泥土刮净、好把甜菜圪塔干干净净地送进糖厂。
