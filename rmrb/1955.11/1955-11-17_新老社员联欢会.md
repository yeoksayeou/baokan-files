New agricultural production cooperatives have expanded, and there are bound to be some rifts between new and veteran members. Veteran members often say, "You didn't come when the cooperative was first started, you only came when it was doing well." New members often feel, "Like a new daughter-in-law, I don't understand the rules of the cooperative and am always afraid of being bullied by the veteran members." In a village with both old and new cooperatives, there are often rifts between the old and new cooperatives as well. In some villages in Mengcun Hui Autonomous County, Hebei Province, such problems have often occurred since the great development of the cooperative movement this autumn. In order to strengthen the unity between new and veteran members and between new and old cooperatives, the general party branches and branch party committees of various townships held get-togethers for new and veteran cooperative members.

At the gatherings, the branch secretary or branch committee member talked about the cooperative movement in the village and its bright future, using the actual situation in the village to explain the benefits of the expansion of the old cooperatives and the establishment of new cooperatives for all the people in the village. New and veteran members had heart-to-heart talks, veteran members introduced the situation and system of the cooperative, and new members talked about their hopes and opinions. In this way, the enthusiasm for running the cooperative in unity was greatly enhanced. Li Yuquan, a veteran member of the Dawentai Village cooperative, said, "I also went from being unwilling to join the cooperative to genuinely joining it. It's not right to look down on new cooperative members. I will definitely help the new cooperative members become familiar with the affairs of the cooperative and work together to improve production." Li Qingyu, a new cooperative member, also untied the knot in his heart, saying, "Once you join the cooperative, you are one family, how can there be disagreements!" In some villages where there was disunity between new and old cooperatives, both sides made self-criticisms at the get-together. After the meeting, the backbone members of the old cooperatives patiently helped the new cooperatives establish production organizations. The new cooperative members said: The old cooperatives are the big brothers, we must learn from the old cooperatives!

　  新老社员联欢会
    农业生产合作社扩大了，新社员同老社员之间难免有些隔阂。老社员往往说：“开始办社你们不来，社办好了你们才来。”新社员往往觉得：“像新媳妇似的，不懂社里的规矩，总怕受老社员的气。”一个村里有老社有新社，老社和新社之间也往往有些隔阂。河北省孟村回族自治县的一些村子里，今年秋后合作化运动大发展以来，就常发生这样的问题。为了加强新老社员、新社老社的团结，各乡总支部和分支部召开了新老社员联欢会。
    联欢会上，支部书记或支部委员谈了本村合作化运动的情况和光明的前途，用本村的实际情况说明了老社的扩大和新社的建立对全村人民的好处；新老社员在会上谈心，老社员介绍社里的情况和制度，新社员谈自己的希望和意见。这样一来，团结办社的热情大大提高了。大文台村老社员李玉泉说：“我过去也是由不愿入社到真心入社的，看不起新社员可不对。我一定帮助新社员熟悉社里的事，一块搞好生产。”新社员李清玉心里的疙瘩也解开了，说：“入了社就是一家人，哪能闹意见！”有些村新社老社闹不团结，在联欢会上，双方都作了自我批评。会后，老社的骨干分子耐心地帮助新社建立生产组织。新社社员们说：老社是老大哥，一定要向老社学习！
