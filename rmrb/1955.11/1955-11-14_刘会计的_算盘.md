　　Accountant Liu's “Abacus”
　　Li Ronghui
　　Liu Zhonghua is an accountant at the Dacheng Flour Mill in Chuxian County. He must be skilled at using the abacus, his calculations even extending to widows and orphans.

　　In the spring of 1952, Accountant Liu met a widow. Afterwards, he often visited her home for chats. As time went on, he became confident and felt that her conditions perfectly matched his "ideal": she wasn't too old, fifteen years younger than him; she was pretty and clever, much better than his wife in the countryside; and, importantly, she owned a large tile-roofed house, worth a lot of money!

　　He tried every means to divorce his wife in the countryside and then diligently worked to gain the affection and trust of his new "target." After half a year of "effort," he finally remarried at the age of forty-seven. The woman, however, did not bring him that tile-roofed house, but she brought one thousand yuan in cash. That was the money she received after selling the house and dividing it equally with her late husband's family members.

　　Having both a woman and money, Liu Zhonghua was naturally very satisfied. Moreover, not long after the marriage, the woman was introduced by him to work as a female worker at the Dacheng Flour Mill, which meant an additional income every month.

　　The happy life after the wedding made Accountant Liu's face shine with oiliness, and his eyes were always squeezed into a seam with a smile.

　　But before long, Accountant Liu's satisfied expression faded. He discovered that there were still some eyesores in his "new life": that was the three children the woman had brought from her previous marriage. Of course, he had seen these three children before, and he had even expressed concern for them, but after everything was settled, he realized that their existence was superfluous. It was as if he was chewing a mouthful of fragrant rice and suddenly found a few grains of sand mixed in.

　　Taking advantage of the new marriage being sweet, he proposed to the woman that she send the eldest child to the paternal grandmother and the second child to the paternal uncle. See how thoughtfully he calculated. However, after negotiations with the late husband's relatives, things did not materialize according to his "abacus."

　　After this, these three children made Accountant Liu feel more and more like they were a thorn in his side. The neighbors often saw the children's bewildered and frightened expressions, and heard their low cries. Accountant Liu's excuses and methods for tormenting the children were varied. Sometimes, he would use the excuse that the children didn't call him "Dad," saying they looked down on him, and would start hitting them. Sometimes, if the children didn't pay attention to his teachings, they would also be punished: either they wouldn't get food, or their arms and legs would suffer, being twisted black and blue. One Sunday morning, Accountant Liu didn't get up until after ten o'clock. He sat on the bed and shouted at the eldest girl without calling her name, "Pour me a glass of water!" The eldest girl didn't dare to delay and immediately poured a glass of water, carefully bringing it to the bed. "Miss, it's so hot!" After a while, the glass of water wasn't so "hot" anymore, and the eldest girl carefully brought it to him again. "Too cold, damn it, how can I drink it!" Accountant Liu jumped to the table and smashed the glass and the thermos bottle on the ground with a crash. After breaking the glass and the thermos bottle, Accountant Liu felt a pang of heartache, and of course, ultimately, he had to blame the girl for not serving him well. The girl received another scolding.

　　The children, after being beaten and wronged, dared not cry loudly. The reason was that Accountant Liu had established a family "covenant" with them: "Don't talk about things at home outside. If others ask, 'How does your father treat you?' say 'Very well.' Whoever dares to talk nonsense, hum..." Although the following words were not explicitly stated, the children knew from experience what kind of practical actions were behind such remarks. Crying was also a violation of Accountant Liu's family "secrecy" regulations. When the children couldn't help but cry, they would immediately hear him squeezing out from between his teeth a low and dignified few words: "Dare to cry? Cry again, and I'll beat you to death!" Accountant Liu often used the methods of twisting and pinching, which had small sounds but great effects, to punish the children, seemingly also starting from this "secrecy" viewpoint.

　　Once, the second child was playing in the factory and saw his mother. He ran to her and plaintively complained, "Look, Dad twisted my legs until they're all purple." Unfortunately, Accountant Liu heard this. As a deserved punishment, the second child did not get lunch that day.

　　Although Accountant Liu paid great attention to family "secrecy" education and had established a family "covenant," as the saying goes, "There is no wall that doesn't leak." Accountant Liu's actions of mistreating the children gradually attracted the attention and indignation of the neighbors and comrades in the factory. Accountant Liu felt that things were not good, so he came up with a "clever" excuse: "Disciplining the children to study hard." If the children came home from school a little late, he wouldn't give them food and would deliberately shout loudly, "Playing crazy outside, not studying hard, not allowed to eat!" He locked the children in the room to review their lessons. If they rested for too long and he walked in and saw them, he would beat them over the head and face. The neighbors heard the beating and scolding and ran to dissuade him. He said with righteous indignation, "The children aren't working hard, I'm disciplining them." This summer vacation, he threatened the two older children, "If you don't pass the entrance exams for junior high school and senior elementary school, go pick grass to live on, I won't give you any food." This caused the siblings to have thoughts of committing suicide by jumping into the river. Fortunately, their mother found out and told the school teacher, and the children gave up the idea.

　　The children's mother also shed many tears for the torment and suffering the children endured. But how can tears defeat Accountant Liu's "abacus"!

　　Accountant Liu's "abacus" has already been pushed to the edge. So what will happen if the abuse continues? Let the law answer!

　　刘会计的“算盘”
　　李荣辉
    刘仲华是滁县大成面粉厂的会计。他一定是精于打算盘的，他的算盘甚至打到寡妇孤儿的头上去了。
    一九五二年的春天，刘会计认识了一位寡妇，以后便经常到她家去闲谈，日子一长，他心里有了底，觉得这个人的条件很合乎他的“理想”：年纪不算大，比自己小十五岁；人又长得清秀又伶俐，比自己在乡下的老婆强多了；同时，她家里还有一大片瓦房，值不少钱！
    他千方百计地同乡下老婆离了婚，又异常殷勤地去取得新“对象”的欢心和信任。经过半年的“努力”，终于在四十七岁上又作了一次新郎。女方呢，没有给他带来那片瓦房，但是带来了一千元现款。那是卖了那片瓦房，同前夫家里的人三股均分分得的财产。
    人财两得，刘仲华当然心满意足。而且女的在结婚后不久，也由他介绍到大成面粉厂去作了女工，这就是说，每月又多了一笔进款。
    新婚后的幸福生活，使得刘会计的脸油光光地发亮，眼睛也总是笑眯眯地挤成了一道缝。
    可是没有多久，刘会计的那种心满意足的神情就淡了下来。他发现他的“新生活”里还有些碍眼的东西：那就是女方带来的前夫的三个孩子。这三个孩子，他从前当然也见过，甚至他还对他们表示过关怀，可是当一切都定下来之后，他就发觉他们的存在是多余了。他好像嚼着一口香喷喷的米饭，忽然发现里面掺有几粒沙子似的。
    趁着新婚情浓，他向女方提出意见，要女方把大孩子送给前夫家里的大妈，二孩子送给前夫家里的叔叔。瞧，他计算得多么周到。可是和前夫族中人交涉的结果，事情没有按照他的“算盘”实现。
    这以后， 这三个孩子就越发使刘会计感到戳眼睛了。而左近的邻居们也就常常看到那三个孩子的惶惑惊恐的神色，听到那三个孩子的低低的哭声。刘会计折磨孩子们的借口和方式，是多种多样的。有时候，借口孩子没有管他叫爸爸，说是看不起他，动手就打；有时候，孩子们没有注意听他的教训，也要受到惩罚：或是吃不到饭，或是胳膊、腿就要遭殃，被拧得青一块紫一块。一个星期天的上午，刘会计睡到十点多钟才起床，他坐在床上朝着最大的女孩子没名没姓地叫道：“倒杯水来！”大女孩子不敢怠慢，马上倒了一杯水，小心翼翼地送到了床前。“小姐，这么烫！”过了一会，那杯水不那么“烫”了，大女孩子又把它小心翼翼地送给他。“太凉啦，妈的，叫老子怎么喝！”刘会计一步窜到桌子前，咣啷一声把杯子和热水瓶打到地上。打碎了杯子和热水瓶，刘会计又感到一阵心痛，而归根结柢，当然又得怪女孩子侍候不周。女孩子又受了一顿责罚。
    孩子们挨了打，受了委屈，是不敢放大哭声的。原因是刘会计和他们订有家庭“约法”：“家里的事不许在外面讲。别人如果问‘爸爸待你们怎样？’就说‘很好’。哪个敢乱说，哼……”下面的话虽然没有说明，但孩子们从经验里知道这种言论的背后会有什么样的实际行动。哭，当然也是违反刘会计的家庭“保密”条例的。孩子们忍不住要哭的时候，马上就会听到他从牙缝里挤出来的低沉而又威严的几个字：“敢哭？再哭，打死！”刘会计责罚孩子们，经常用那种声音小而效果大的拧和掐的办法，似乎也是从这种“保密”观点出发的。
    有一次，二孩子在厂里玩，看到妈妈，就跑去凄切地向妈妈申诉：“瞧，爸爸把我的腿都拧紫了。”不巧，这话被刘会计听见了，作为应得的处罚，二孩子在这天就没有吃到午饭。
    尽管刘会计非常注意家庭“保密”教育，订有家庭“约法”，但是，俗话说得好：没有不透风的墙。刘会计虐待孩子的行径，逐渐引起了邻居们和厂里同志们的注意和愤慨。刘会计感到事情有些不妙了，于是又想出了一个“聪明”的借口：“管教孩子好好学习”。孩子放学回家迟了一些，他不给饭吃，而且故意大声嚷道：“在外面玩疯啦，不好好用功，不准吃饭！”他把孩子们关在屋子里温课，时间长了，孩子们刚休息，他闯进去看见了，劈头盖脑就打。邻居们听到打骂声，跑去劝阻，他就理直气壮地说：“孩子不用功嘛，我是在管教他们。” 今年暑假，他威胁两个大孩子说：“你们如果考不上初中和高小，就去拾草生活吧，我没有饭给你们吃。”使姐弟俩萌了投河自杀的念头，幸而妈妈知道了，告诉了学校教师，孩子们才打消了这个念头。
    孩子们的母亲为孩子所受的折磨和痛苦，也流过不少泪。可是眼泪又怎能战胜刘会计的“算盘”！
    刘会计的“算盘”是已经打到边了。那么再虐待下去又怎样呢？应该让法律来回答！
