Hubei Province has achieved a bumper peanut harvest this year. It is estimated that the average yield per unit area in the province will exceed the plan by more than 10%, an increase of about 30% compared to the bumper year of 1953. This year, Hubei farmers have actively improved their farming techniques, selecting high-yield, high-oil-content, erect-growth varieties suitable for close planting and easy to dig, which has greatly increased peanut production. The nine agricultural production cooperatives in Xinghua Township, Hongan County, planted 1,318 mu of peanuts this year, with an average yield of 406 jin per mu, an increase of 48.3% over last year. Nannengang Agricultural Cooperative planted 4 mu of peanuts last year, yielding 500 jin per mu. This year, after learning about the "two retentions" policy for the unified purchase of oil crops, the peanut area was expanded to 15 mu, with a total harvest of 9,248 jin, achieving a high yield of 616 jin per mu.

    湖北省花生普遍丰收
    湖北省今年花生获得丰收。估计全省平均单位面积产量将超过计划一成以上，比丰收的一九五三年增产三成左右。湖北农民今年都积极改进了耕作技术，选用产量高、出油多、适于密植而又好挖的直生种，使花生产量大大提高。红安县杏花乡九个农业生产合作社，今年种植花生一千三百十八亩，平均每亩可收四百零六斤，比去年增产百分之四八·三。南门岗农业合作社去年种四亩花生，每亩收五百斤，今年学习了油料统购的两留政策，花生面积扩大到十五亩，共收花生九千二百四十八斤，获得平均每亩六百十六斤的高额产量。
