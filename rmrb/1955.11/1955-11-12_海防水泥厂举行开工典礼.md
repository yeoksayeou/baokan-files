　  Haiphong Cement Plant Holds Opening Ceremony

　  The Haiphong Cement Plant held its opening ceremony on November 7th – the 38th anniversary of the October Revolution. On that day, part of the factory's machinery had already begun to operate. It is expected that the plant will officially begin producing cement around November 25th.

　  The Haiphong Cement Plant is the largest factory in Haiphong and was originally operated with French capital. Before liberation, the factory had more than 4,000 workers, and its maximum annual output reached 306,000 tons. However, on the eve of liberation, almost all of the factory's transportation equipment was taken away, and many machines were damaged. The workers began repairing the machinery in September of this year. They completed the work plan eight days ahead of schedule, finally restoring this severely damaged factory.

　  海防水泥厂举行开工典礼
    海防水泥厂在七日——十月革命三十八周年纪念日举行开工典礼。当天，工厂的一部分机器已经开始运转，到十一月二十五日左右，就可以正式开始生产水泥。
    海防水泥厂是海防最大的工厂，原为法国资本经营。解放前，这个厂有四千多个工人，最高年产量达到三十万六千吨。但在解放前夕，工厂的运输工具几乎全部被运走，许多机器被破坏。工人们在今年九月份开始了修理机器的工作。他们提前八天完成工作计划，终于使这个遭到严重破坏的工厂得到恢复。（据新华社讯）
