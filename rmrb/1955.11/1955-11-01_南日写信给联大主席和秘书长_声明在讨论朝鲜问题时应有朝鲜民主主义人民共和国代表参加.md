Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 31st. According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Foreign Minister Nam Il of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea sent identical documents to José Maza, President of the Tenth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, and Dag Hammarskjöld, Secretary-General of the United Nations, on October 31, declaring that representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea should participate in the discussions on the Korean question at this session of the United Nations General Assembly.

In his letter, Nam Il stated: "The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea believes that a one-sided discussion of the Korean question without the participation of its own representatives will not lead to a practical solution. Therefore, it requests that representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea participate in the discussion of the Korean question at this session of the General Assembly."

The letter also stated: "The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea believes that only by allowing representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to participate in the discussion of the Korean question at this session of the General Assembly can it be expected to be a fair discussion and contribute to the cause of the United Nations as an international organization for maintaining overall peace and security."

Foreign Minister Nam Il requested that this statement be distributed to the representatives of all member states of the United Nations and that he be notified of the outcome.

    南日写信给联大主席和秘书长
    声明在讨论朝鲜问题时应有朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表参加
    新华社平壤三十一日电　据朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务省宣布，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相南日在十月三十一日把内容相同的文件分别发给第十届联合国大会主席何塞·马萨和联合国秘书长达格·哈马舍尔德，声明在本届联合国大会讨论朝鲜问题时应有朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表参加。
    南日在信中说：“朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府认为：没有自己代表参加的关于朝鲜问题的片面讨论，将不可能得到实际的解决，因此要求应有朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表参加本届大会关于朝鲜问题的讨论。”
    信中又说：“朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府相信：只有让朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表参加本届大会关于朝鲜问题的讨论，才能期望它成为公正的讨论，并且有助于联合国作为维护全面和平和安全的国际机构的事业。”
    南日外务相要求把这项声明分发给联合国所有会员国的代表，并且把结果通知他。
