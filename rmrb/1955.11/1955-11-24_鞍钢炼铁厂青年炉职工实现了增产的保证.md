　　Anshan Iron and Steel Works Iron Smelting Plant Youth Furnace Workers Guarantee Increased Production
　　The Youth Furnace workers of the Anshan Iron and Steel Works Iron Smelting Plant have fulfilled the pledge made by furnace leader Wang Hongshun on behalf of the Youth Furnace at the National Youth Socialist Construction Activists Congress to increase pig iron production by 17,200 tons this year. As of November 5th, in addition to fulfilling the state production plan each month, they have already increased pig iron production for the state by more than 18,640 tons and saved more than 12,130 tons of coke.
　　Since furnace leader Wang Hongshun returned and conveyed the spirit of the Congress to all the furnace workers, greatly inspiring their enthusiasm for production, they have been deeply engaged in labor emulation. In the competition, the workers, based on Wang Hongshun's proposal, learned from the No. 6 Blast Furnace workers' experience in promoting the advanced Soviet iron smelting experience: using steam to regulate the furnace temperature, gradually increasing the wind temperature from 850 degrees to 900 degrees, and continuously achieving new records in production. The effective volume occupied per ton of iron smelted broke through the technical indicators stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan, thereby rapidly increasing output.
　　Now, they have decided to further increase pig iron production by 2,350 tons and save 2,860 tons of coke by the end of the year on the basis of completing the state plan.

　　鞍钢炼铁厂青年炉职工实现了增产的保证
　　鞍钢炼铁厂青年炉职工，提前实现了炉长王洪顺代表青年炉在全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会上提出的要在今年增产一万七千二百吨生铁的保证，到十一月五日止，在按月完成国家生产计划基础上，已经给国家增产了一万八千六百四十多吨生铁，并且节约了一万二千一百三十多吨焦炭。
　　青年炉自从炉长王洪顺回来向全炉职工传达了大会精神，鼓舞了职工们的生产热情以后，深入地开展了劳动竞赛。工人们在竞赛中，根据王洪顺提议，向六高炉职工学习了关于推广苏联先进炼铁经验的经验：用蒸汽调解炉温，使风温由八百五十度逐渐提高到九百度，生产不断出现新纪录。每炼一吨铁所占用的有效容积突破了第一个五年计划所规定的技术指标，因而迅速提高了产量。
　　现在，他们决定到年底在完成国家计划的基础上，再增产二千三百五十吨生铁，并且节约二千八百六十吨焦炭。
