    Learn from the Soviet Union, Build Our Country's Health Undertakings
    Li Dequan, Minister of Public Health of the People's Republic of China
    The thirty-eighth anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution has arrived.
    On the occasion of the thirty-eighth anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution, I would like to express my congratulations to the Soviet medical workers.
    We will never forget that our great ally, the Soviet Union, has provided us with large-scale assistance in our socialist construction, helping our socialist construction and accelerating the early arrival of our socialist society. Here, we express our heartfelt gratitude to the Soviet Union for this selfless and generous spirit.
    We will also never forget that the Soviet Party, government, and people have given comprehensive help to our medical and health undertakings. In the past few years, the Soviet Union has sent a large number of excellent medical experts to help build our country's health undertakings, prevent and control the spread of epidemics, cultivate scientific talents, and impart advanced scientific technologies and work experience; moreover, in terms of medical style, they have set a good example for our country's medical workers. The advancement of Soviet medical science lies in the fact that it is based on the advanced scientific theory of dialectical materialism and established according to the principle of the unity of theory and practice. Pavlov's advanced medical theories have played a huge role in our country's medical and health care, medical clinical practice, and medical education, pointing out a new direction. These have opened up broad development paths for our health care undertakings.
    In the past few years, the solidarity, mutual assistance, and friendly visits between Chinese and Soviet medical workers have also been increasing year by year. Through these cooperation and visits, not only have we exchanged experiences with each other, but we have also enhanced the increasingly close friendship between medical workers of the two countries. In February of this year, Soviet Minister of Health Comrade Kovrigina and Minister of Health of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic Comrade Sagatov were invited to China for a month-long friendly visit, giving us a lot of valuable experience, which is something we will never forget. Now, the Soviet Medical Science Delegation headed by Krotkov has been invited to China to lecture and visit, which will play a major role in improving China's medical science. Their noble, sincere, and selfless spirit of internationalism demonstrates the increasing consolidation of the unity of Chinese and Soviet medical workers and the further development of friendly relations.
    Here, I cannot help but recall the profound impressions I gained during my friendly visit to the Soviet Union in July last year. During this visit to the Soviet Union, we visited Soviet medical prevention, health and epidemic prevention, medical education, and scientific research institutions, visited the health work of collective farms, textile factories, etc., workers' sanatoriums, and other cultural and welfare facilities, extensively contacted Soviet medical scientists, and sincerely exchanged opinions on health work with leading comrades of the Soviet Ministry of Health, which enabled me to learn a lot of advanced health work experience. In recent years, Chinese medical workers have been invited to the Soviet Union many times to participate in professional conferences and visits. Through these visits, they have gained a better understanding of the superiority of Soviet health care work. Soviet medical workers are sincerely admired in terms of their political ideology, working methods, medical technology, and research results, which further enhances our determination and confidence in learning from the Soviet Union.
    The achievements and future development of the Soviet health care undertaking are inseparable from the superiority of the Soviet socialist system and the correct leadership of the Party and the government. The Soviet socialist construction's fifth five-year plan has been successfully completed, production has grown rapidly, and the people's living standards have greatly improved. This has laid a more solid material foundation for the future development of health care undertakings. In the future, under the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet government (through the Ministry of Health), the Soviet health care undertaking will inevitably be more widely carried out according to the needs of the people and the needs of communist construction, and will play a greater role in improving the health of the people.
    At present, in the Soviet Union, virulent infectious diseases have been eliminated, and general infectious diseases have also been completely controlled and are gradually decreasing. The recent newspaper announcement that the Soviet Union is to eliminate malaria within five years is a great event in human history and something that all capitalist countries cannot imagine.
    The Soviet Union attaches particular importance to protecting the health of workers. Factories and mines have special institutions for medical services for workers; workshops and tunnels also have special doctors and nurses who provide mobile medical care and first aid. In cities, in addition to city hospitals, district hospitals, children's hospitals, and various clinics, each district has district doctors. These physicians of various departments, warmly called "family doctors" by the residents, are responsible for the health of the residents in the district. They often visit the residents to carry out health publicity and education, improve the residents' health literacy, and improve the residents' living conditions. Collective farms also have clinics, maternity hospitals, and other medical prevention institutions. These institutions provide free services to the people.
    I would particularly like to mention the Soviet Union's maternal and child health work. The Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet government are very concerned about women and children, and women and children are receiving meticulous care in all aspects. Various necessary measures have been taken for the special health needs of women due to their physiological conditions, such as vacations, subsidies, care for mothers with many children, and preferential treatment for children of disabled veterans of the Patriotic War. Deaths due to childbirth are almost non-existent. Many women's consultation centers have been established in cities, factories, and rural areas, responsible for women's health care, medical treatment, prevention, and publicity education. In terms of children's health care, the Soviet Ministry of Health has a Children's Medical Prevention Administration, and each province and city under the affiliated republics also has a series of organizational structures. Children from birth to the age of sixteen can be regularly observed by doctors, and there are also sanatoriums specially for children, pediatric bone tuberculosis hospitals, and other medical institutions specially serving children. The medical staff of various institutions are also kind, considerate and meticulous to the children, making every young patient feel as if they are in their own home.
    The Soviet Union also attaches great importance to the training of medical and health cadres. At present, they have seventy-six higher medical colleges and universities distributed throughout the country, with more than 120,000 students studying in schools every year. The Soviet Union's cadre training not only emphasizes quantity, but also ensures quality. The talents trained have a high level of political and technical skill, and they exert unlimited enthusiasm and creativity in their work. The characteristics of Soviet health care work are its broad scope, large quantity, good quality, and thorough solution of problems. In the institutions we visited, there were many young medical experts, possessing abundant energy, outstanding talents, and rich knowledge. This atmosphere of talent everywhere is extremely enviable.
    In addition, the Soviet medical workers' spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people, humble attitude, and style of close contact with the masses are also worthy of Chinese medical workers' learning.
    It should be specially mentioned that Soviet health care workers cherish historical scientific heritage and attach importance to our country's medical heritage—traditional Chinese medicine. Many medical scientists are extremely interested in traditional Chinese medicine. They highly praise our ancestors' great contributions to mankind in medical science, admire the outstanding achievements of traditional Chinese medicine in ensuring the reproduction of China's 600 million people, and express their willingness to engage in research in this area. Soviet Minister of Health Comrade Kovrigina visited our country's traditional Chinese medical treatment and research institutions during her visit to China, put forward suggestions for improvement, guided research methods, and said, "I have no doubts about the research work of traditional Chinese medicine. I know that traditional Chinese medicine and medicinal herbs are important to our health care work. I have proposed to send experts to learn." At the same time, she instructed the experts who helped with health construction in our country to help well with research work in this area. This scientific attitude of inheriting historical and cultural scientific heritage is something that we should particularly learn, especially for those who still have doubts about the work of traditional Chinese medicine and who still have a wait-and-see attitude towards learning from traditional Chinese medicine, it has a profound educational significance.
    The above several characteristics, of course, cannot summarize all of the Soviet medical and health undertakings and the comprehensive noble qualities of Soviet medical workers, but I believe that these are extremely important and are the basic conditions for medical science and health work to achieve high development and great achievements, and it is also what our Chinese medical workers should learn. It should be said that the direction of the Soviet health care undertaking is the direction we should follow. Some of the work that our country is currently in a position to do, we have already begun to do, and it has been very effective; some are being prepared to do, and some are still creating conditions due to the lack of material conditions; preparing to do it in the future; because the Soviet Union's today is our tomorrow.
    On the occasion of the thirty-eighth anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution, I would like to once again express my gratitude to the Soviet Union and solemnly call on medical and health workers across the country: thoroughly implement Chairman Mao's instructions, conscientiously learn from the Soviet Union, learn from the Soviet Union's advanced science and technology and work experience, learn from the noble moral qualities of Soviet medical and health workers, and learn from their spirit of hard work in building socialism and communism, and strive to build our motherland and realize the first five-year plan of our country's socialist construction.

    学习苏联，建设我国卫生事业
    中华人民共和国卫生部长  李德全
    伟大的十月社会主义革命三十八周年纪念日到来了。
    值此十月社会主义革命三十八周年之际，我谨向苏联医务工作者表示祝贺。
    我们永远不会忘记，我们伟大的盟邦苏联，在我国社会主义建设事业中，所给予我们巨大规模的援助，帮助我国社会主义建设，加速了我国社会主义社会早日到来。在这里，我们向苏联这种无私、慷慨的精神表示衷心的感谢。
    我们同样也永远不会忘记，苏联党、政府和人民，给予我国医药卫生事业上的全面的帮助。几年来，苏联派来了大批优秀的医学专家，帮助我国卫生事业的建设，防治疫疠的流行，培养科学人材，传授先进的科学技术和工作经验；而且在医疗作风上，为我国医务工作者树立了良好的榜样。苏联医学科学的先进性，在于它是以辩证唯物主义先进的科学理论为基础，并根据理论与实践一致的原则建立起来的。巴甫洛夫的先进医学学说，在我国医疗卫生、医学临床和医学教育工作中发生了巨大的作用，指出了一个新的方向。这些，都为我国保健事业开拓了广阔的发展道路。
    几年来，中苏两国医务工作者的团结互助、友好访问也是在逐年的增加着。通过这些合作和访问，不但交流了彼此间的经验，同时还增进了两国医务工作者日益密切的友谊。今年二月，苏联卫生部长科夫里金娜同志和乌兹别克苏维埃社会主义共和国卫生部长萨加托夫同志应邀到中国作了一个月的友好访问，给我们介绍了许多宝贵的经验，这是使我们永志不忘的一件事情。现在以克罗特科夫为首的苏联医学科学代表团，又应邀来到中国讲学和访问，这对中国医学科学的提高，将起重大的作用。他们这种高贵的真诚无私的国际主义精神，表明了中苏两国医务工作者的团结日益巩固和友好关系的进一步的发展。
    这里，我不禁回忆起，去年七月间我在苏联友好访问期间，所得到的深刻的印象。这次在苏联访问过程中，我们参观了苏联医疗预防、卫生防疫、医学教育、科学研究等机构，参观了集体农庄、纺织工厂等的卫生工作、工人疗养院和其他文化福利设施，广泛地接触了苏联的医学科学家，同时和苏联保健部的领导同志倾心地交谈了卫生工作上的意见，使得我学习了很多的、先进的卫生工作经验。几年来，中国医务工作者曾多次应邀到苏联参加专业会议和参观访问，通过这些访问，对苏联保健工作的优越性有了更进一步的认识。苏联医务工作者们在政治思想上、工作方法上、医疗技术上和研究成果上，都使我们衷心敬佩，从而更增强了我们向苏联学习的决心和信心。
    苏联保健事业已有的成绩和今后的发展，是同苏联社会主义制度的优越性，同党和政府的正确领导分不开的。苏联社会主义建设第五个五年计划已胜利完成，生产迅速增长，人民生活大大提高。这给今后保健事业的发展奠定了更坚实的物质基础。今后，苏联保健事业在苏联共产党和苏联政府（通过保健部）的领导下，按照人民的需要和共产主义建设的需要，必然有更广泛的开展，对增进人民的健康，将会起更大的作用。
    目前在苏联烈性传染病已被消灭，一般传染病也被完全控制，并日渐减少。最近报纸上发表的，苏联要在五年内消灭疟疾，这在人类历史上是一个伟大的事件，是一切资本主义国家所不能想像的事。
    苏联特别重视保护工人的健康。在工厂、矿山都设有专门为工人医疗服务的机构；车间、坑道中也有专门的医师和护士巡回医疗和急救。在城市中，除设有市医院、区医院、儿童医院及各门诊部等医疗机构外，每一地段都设有地段医生，这些被居民热情地称为“家庭医生”的各科医师，负责该地段的居民健康，他们经常到居民中去访视，开展卫生宣传教育，提高居民卫生文化水平，改善居民生活条件。在集体农庄，也设有门诊部、产院等医疗预防机构。这些机械都是免费为人民服务的。
    我特别要提一下苏联的妇幼卫生工作。苏联共产党和苏联政府对妇女和儿童是十分关怀的，妇女和儿童在各方面都受着无微不至的照顾。对于妇女由于生理条件所形成的特殊保健需要，采取了各种必要措施，如休假、津贴、对多子女的母亲的照顾，对卫国战争中残废者的子女的优待等。妇女因生产而死亡的几乎没有了。在城市、工厂、农村中设立了许多妇女咨询所，负担起妇女的保健、医疗、预防和宣传教育的工作。在儿童保健方面，在苏联保健部下设有儿童医疗预防管理局，各加盟共和国所属各省、市也都有一系列的组织机构，孩子们从初生到十六岁都可以受到医师的经常观察，还有专为儿童设立的疗养院、小儿骨结核医院，以及其他专为儿童服务的医疗机构。各机构的医护人员对孩子们态度也是和蔼可亲的、体贴入微的，使得每一个小患者都感到如同在自己的家庭一样。
    苏联对培养医药卫生干部也是十分重视的。目前他们有七十六所高等医学院校分布在全国，每年有十二万多名学生在校学习。苏联的干部培养，不但重视数量，而且保证了质量，培养出来的人才都具有高度的政治水平和技术水平，工作中发挥出无限的积极性和创造性。工作的面广、量多、质好，解决问题彻底，是苏联保健工作的特点。在我们参观的机构中都有很多年轻的医学专家，具备着充沛的精力、卓越的才能、丰富的知识。这种到处人才济济的气象，极其令人羡慕。
    此外，苏联医务工作者表现的全心全意为人民服务的精神、谦逊的态度和密切联系群众的作风，也都是值得中国医务工作者学习的。
    应该特别提出的，苏联保健工作者是非常珍贵历史科学遗产和重视我国医学遗产——中医医学的，很多医学科学家对中医感到极大的兴趣，他们十分颂扬我们祖先在医学科学事业上对人类伟大的贡献，赞叹中医保证我国民族六亿人口繁衍的卓越功绩，并表示愿意从事这方面的研究。苏联卫生部长科夫里金娜同志在我国访问期间，曾参观过我国中医医疗和研究机构，提出了改进的意见，指导了研究方法，并且表示说：“我对中医研究工作是没有任何怀疑的，我知道中医中药对我们保健工作是重要的，我已提出要派专家来学习。”她同时指示在我国帮助卫生建设的专家，要他们很好地帮助这方面的研究工作。这种科学的继承历史文化科学遗产的态度，是我们特别应当学习的，尤其是对那些现在对于中医工作尚存有怀疑思想、对向中医学习尚抱有观望态度的人，更有着深刻的教育意义。
    以上几个特点，当然不能概括苏联医药卫生事业的全部和苏联医务工作者的全面的高贵品质，但是我认为这些都是极重要的，是医学科学、卫生工作获得高度发展与伟大成就的基本条件，也正是我们中国医务工作者所应该学习的地方。应当说，苏联保健事业的方向就是我们应该走的方向，有些工作目前我国已具备条件的，我们已经开始作了，而且很有成效；有些正在准备作，有些则由于物质条件尚不具备，我们也正在创造条件；准备将来去作；因为苏联的今天，就是我们的明天。
    值此十月社会主义革命三十八周年纪念之际，我特再一次向苏联表示感谢，并向全国医药卫生工作者郑重号召：贯彻执行毛主席的指示，认真学习苏联，学习苏联先进的科学技术和工作经验，学习苏联医药卫生工作人员的高贵的道德品质，学习他们建设社会主义共产主义的艰苦奋斗的精神，为建设我们的祖国，为实现我国社会主义建设的第一个五年计划而努力。
