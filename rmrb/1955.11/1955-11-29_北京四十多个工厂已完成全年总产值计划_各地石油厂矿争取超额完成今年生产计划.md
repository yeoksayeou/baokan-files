　　Over Forty Factories in Beijing Have Completed Their Annual Gross Output Value Plans
　　Petroleum Factories and Mines in Various Regions Strive to Exceed Their Annual Production Plans

    This newspaper reports that, according to incomplete statistics up to November 28th, forty-two industrial enterprises in Beijing have completed their annual gross output value plans ahead of schedule, including the state-owned Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory, the state-owned First Automobile Accessories Factory, the state-owned Beijing Scientific Instrument Factory, the locally state-owned Beijing General Machinery Factory, the locally state-owned Beijing No. 1 Dyeing and Weaving Factory, the joint state-private Jinghua Printing House, and the joint state-private Samsung Pencil Factory.

    This year, these industrial enterprises have all learned and promoted advanced experiences, launched labor competitions and a struggle to practice thrift and oppose waste, further improved enterprise management, and increased the quantity and quality of their products. The vast number of workers at the First Automobile Accessories Factory have earnestly studied the advanced Soviet lathe tool method and Kovalev's work method this year, generally improving production efficiency. Currently, ten machinists and fitters, including Luo Shucheng and Zhang Jinghan, have completed their annual workload ahead of schedule and have started working on 1956's tasks. The Beijing General Machinery Factory has appropriately arranged the work plans of workshops and groups this year, achieving balanced production and saving a significant amount of work hours. In the past, manufacturing a double-wheel double-share plow required an average of 24.19 hours, but now it only takes 11.09 hours. After implementing the team-based economic accounting system, the workers at the Beijing Cement Brick and Tile Factory have worked hard to improve their skills and reduce cement waste, achieving a cement utilization rate of over 99% and reducing the defect rate from the original 1% to 0.3%.

    These units that have completed their annual gross output value plans ahead of schedule are generally enterprises that maintain normal production. The Beijing Paper Mill, the Beijing Brewery, the Printing Factory of the People's Bank of China, the Beijing Fine Arts Printing Factory, the Beijing Soy Sauce Factory, the Sanming Asbestos Factory, the Samsung Pencil Factory, and others have comprehensively completed the state production plan in terms of gross output value, labor productivity, cost, and profit in the first three quarters of this year. In the city-wide inter-factory labor competition in the previous quarters, the Beijing General Machinery Factory and the Beijing Cement Brick and Tile Factory were recognized as the city's outstanding units; the Changxindian Communications Factory, the Beijing No. 4 Printing Factory, and the Samsung Pencil Factory were also recognized as outstanding industrial units.

    This newspaper reports that petroleum factories and mines across the country are working hard to exceed this year's petroleum production plan. After exceeding the production plan for the third quarter, by the end of October, the factories and mines had completed 87.7% of the annual gross output value plan. The petroleum production of the Yanchang Oil Mine in Shaanxi has created the highest record in the mine's history, with the total output value exceeding the annual plan by 118.5%; Petroleum Factories No. 7, No. 4, and No. 10, as well as the Yumen Mining Bureau, have all completed over 90% of the annual gross output value plan.

    Among the nine major products produced by the petroleum factories and mines, lubricating oil has exceeded the annual plan by 111.1%, carbon black has completed 91.6%, and kerosene, sulfuric acid, gasoline, crude oil, diesel, ammonium sulfate, and fuel oil have all completed over 80%. The annual cost plan has been exceeded, and it is estimated that by the end of this year, it will increase production and save approximately 10 million yuan for the country, equivalent to more than twice the original plan for increasing production, saving, and reducing costs. In addition, various technical and economic norms, labor productivity, profit delivery, and capital turnover will also reach national targets.

    Under the slogan of producing more petroleum for the country, the workers of various factories and mines actively implemented the suggestions of Soviet experts in production and adopted a series of technical measures and production increase measures. The Yumen Mining Bureau emphasized the protection of oilfields and achieved great success in water and gas injection, significantly reducing the comprehensive oil-gas ratio. At the same time, it also seized the opportunity to exploit small oilfields, with the oil production of small oilfields in the third quarter increasing by 71% compared to the second quarter. Due to the opening of new oil wells, the oil production in October increased by more than 3,900 tons compared to the original plan. The Xinjiang Petroleum Company actively implemented the suggestions of Soviet experts, and October created the highest record for crude oil production this year. In terms of synthetic petroleum, Petroleum Factory No. 9, in addition to experimenting with lump dry distillation, also used waste shale to press bricks and refine oil. According to the results of laboratory tests, the oil yield of waste shale reached 70%. In addition, various factories and mines also attach great importance to waste oil recovery.

　　北京四十多个工厂已完成全年总产值计划
　　各地石油厂矿争取超额完成今年生产计划
    本报讯　据截至十一月二十八日的不完全统计，北京市已经有国营北京农业机械厂、国营第一汽车附件厂、国营北京科学仪器厂、地方国营北京市通用机械厂、地方国营北京市染织一厂、公私合营京华印书局、公私合营三星铅笔厂等四十二个工业企业提前完成了全年总产值计划。
    这些工业企业今年都学习和推广了先进经验，开展了劳动竞赛和厉行节约、反对浪费的斗争，进一步改进了企业管理，产品的产量和质量都有了提高。第一汽车附件厂广大职工今年认真学习了苏联的先进车刀法和郭瓦廖夫工作法，普遍提高了生产效率。目前，全厂已经有罗恕成、张景汉等十名机工和钳工提前完成了全年工作量，开始作一九五六年的工作。北京市通用机械厂今年适当地安排了车间和小组的作业计划，作到了均衡生产，并且大量节约了工时。这个工厂过去制造一部双轮双铧犁平均需要二十四点一九小时，现在只用十一点零九小时。北京市水泥砖瓦厂推行班组经济核算以后，工人们努力提高技术，减少水泥的损耗，水泥利用率达到了百分之九十九以上，废品率也从原来的百分之一降低到百分之零点三。
    这些提前完成全年总产值计划的单位，一般都是生产情况经常保持正常的企业。北京造纸厂、北京啤酒厂、中国人民银行印刷厂、北京美术印刷厂、北京市酱油厂、三明石棉厂、三星铅笔厂等，在今年前三个季度都按总产值、劳动生产率、成本、利润四项指标全面完成了国家生产计划。在前几个季度的全市厂际劳动竞赛中，北京市通用机械厂、北京市水泥砖瓦厂等曾被评为全市优胜单位；长辛店通信工厂、北京市印刷四厂、三星铅笔厂等，也曾被评作产业优胜单位。
    本报讯　全国各石油厂矿，正在努力超额完成今年的石油生产计划。在第三季度的生产计划超额完成后，到十月底各厂矿已完成全年总产值计划的百分之八十七点七。陕西延长油矿的石油产量已创造了这个矿历史上的最高纪录，总产值超额完成了全年计划的百分之一百一十八点五；石油七厂、四厂、十厂以及玉门矿务局都已完成全年总产值计划的百分之九十以上。
    在各石油厂矿生产的九种主要产品方面，润滑油已经超额完成了年度计划的百分之一百一十一点一，碳黑完成了百分之九十一点六，煤油、硫酸、汽油、原油、柴油、硫铵、燃料油也都已完成百分之八十以上。全年成本计划已经超额完成，预计到今年年底可为国家增产节约一千万元左右，相当于原订增产节约降低成本计划的两倍以上。此外，各项技术经济定额、劳动生产率、上缴利润和资金周转等也将达到国家指标。
    各厂矿职工在为国家生产更多的石油的口号下，在生产中积极贯彻苏联专家建议，采取了一系列的技术措施和增产措施。玉门矿务局重视了保护油田工作，对油田注水、注气工作取得很大成绩，使综合油气比有了显著降低。同时并抓紧了对小油田的开采，小油田第三季度的采油量比第二季度提高了百分之七十一。由于增开了新油井，十月份的产油量比原计划增加了三千九百多吨。新疆石油公司积极贯彻苏联专家建议，十月份创造了今年以来原油产量的最高纪录。在人造石油方面，石油九厂除试验出成堆干馏外，并利用废页岩压砖炼油。据在试验室中试验结果，废页岩的出油率达百分之七十。此外，各厂矿并很重视废油回收工作。
