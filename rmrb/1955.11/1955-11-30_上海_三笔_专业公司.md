　　Shanghai "Three Pens" Specialized Company
　　Hong Jun
　　In March of this year, the Shanghai First Bureau of Light Industry established a Pen Manufacturing Company, placing all of the city's more than 400 gold pen, fountain pen, and pencil (hereinafter referred to as "three pens") factories, of various economic types, under its management, from production arrangements and leadership to technical guidance, and economic restructuring and socialist transformation. It is responsible both for raising the entire industry from a scattered, backward, and technically inferior level to a centralized, advanced socialist production level, and for changing the entire industry from a situation of coexistence of several economic types into a single socialist economy. This company is both an economic and a political organ. Although the enterprises it manages are currently mostly private factories, and its staff includes some figures from industry and commerce, it is a socialist, state-owned, specialized enterprise management organization.
　　The vast majority of China's "three pens" manufacturing industrial enterprises are concentrated in Shanghai. In 1954, Shanghai's "three pens" output accounted for the following proportions of the national total: gold pens, 80.2 percent; fountain pens, 86.34 percent; and pencils, 52.63 percent. Shanghai's "three pens" industry developed after liberation. After liberation, with the improvement of people's cultural living standards and the development of cultural undertakings, the demand for gold and fountain pens once exceeded supply. The "three pens" industry's equipment was simple, factory construction required little capital, and profits were high. In addition, the state had not strictly managed the "three pens" industry in the past, leading to a blind and massive development of the "three pens" industry. For example, in the gold pen industry, there were only eight small factories before liberation, but by 1954, this had grown to thirty-nine, and the 1954 output increased eightfold compared to 1950. When Shanghai was first liberated, there were only thirty-plus fountain pen factories, but by 1953, this had grown to three hundred and forty-three. The result of this blind development was overproduction, poor quality, and a large backlog of products. By the end of 1954, the number of "three pens" products in backlog nationwide was equivalent to the output of nine to fifteen months in 1953. At that time, due to product backlogs, gold pen factories in Shanghai generally operated at only 20 to 30 percent capacity, and the backlog of fountain pens was even more severe, with most fountain pen factories being shut down or partially shut down. The difficulties in the gold and fountain pen industries also affected the parts factories that collaborated with them. Due to production difficulties and enterprise losses, the livelihoods of several thousand workers could not be maintained. Therefore, the urgent task facing the Pen Manufacturing Company upon its establishment was to quickly arrange production for the entire industry.
　　This year, the state allocated Shanghai's annual "three pens" production targets, with gold pens reduced by 37.1 percent and fountain pens reduced by 41.04 percent compared to 1954. Based on the production targets allocated by the state, the Pen Manufacturing Company made appropriate adjustments to the allocation of production tasks for factories of various economic types. In the gold pen industry, factories of the local state-owned, joint state-private, and private economic types all faced difficulties, with private enterprises facing the greatest challenges. According to the principle of "overall planning, taking all aspects into consideration, both differentiated and equal treatment," the production tasks of some local state-owned and joint state-private factories were drawn from to arrange for the production of private factories. After this adjustment, the production tasks of private factories increased by an average of 26.87 percent, while the production tasks of joint state-private and local state-owned factories decreased by an average of 7 to 8 percent. The uneven distribution of production tasks within local state-owned and joint state-private factories was alleviated, and they also had profits. Private factories could not only maintain production, but also have a slight surplus after improving management. The Pen Manufacturing Company also, based on the principle of "rewarding the advanced, taking care of the backward, and eliminating the harmful," gave more production tasks to factories with good product quality and popular with users, regardless of their economic type, while giving fewer tasks to those with poor quality. Seven factories with such poor quality that they could not continue producing gold pens were mobilized to switch to fountain pen production.
　　The arrangement of fountain pen production was more complicated. There were one hundred and eighty-eight private fountain pen factories (including the seven gold pen factories that switched), with one hundred having nine or fewer workers, including fourteen with no employees and forty-two with only one to three employees. "One kerosene lamp, two pairs of pliers" was all the production equipment they had; most of their capital had been exhausted. The entire industry did not have a single all-around factory; even the relatively advanced factories needed three to five factories to produce one pen, while backward factories needed fifteen to twenty. Without combining unified arrangements for production reorganization, it would be difficult to improve technology, the product quality could not be guaranteed, and even if production tasks were assigned, it would be difficult to maintain them.
　　With the assistance of the trade union and the industrial and commercial administrative departments in various districts, the Pen Manufacturing Company took the following measures: first, it assigned production tasks to the ninety-eight factories with independent production conditions, allowing them to continue production; second, for those factories that had some capital but lacked equipment and production conditions, or could produce but not guarantee quality, they were mobilized to merge labor with factories that had conditions, maintain production, and then consider enterprise mergers depending on the situation; third, for factories with no capital, equipment, or technical conditions, and only a few employees, the enterprises were eliminated, and efforts were made to place their personnel in large factories to maintain their livelihoods. Using these methods, sixty-seven small factories were eliminated, and their employees were placed in ninety-one large factories. Another twenty-two small factories were merged into two larger factories. The merger work was very complex. This time, only the merger of labor was carried out, and issues such as asset liquidation and equity determination were intentionally left for later. The benefit of doing so was that it facilitated a rapid recovery of production.
　　With the production arrangements for gold and fountain pen factories settled, parts factories were naturally driven. In the past, the production of parts factories was free competition, and the quality and specifications of products were very chaotic, and the amount of work was also uneven. This time, the parts factories were largely matched with the pen factories according to their original cooperative production relationships. At the same time, the production tasks were partially adjusted according to the principle of "rewarding the advanced, taking care of the backward, and eliminating the harmful."
　　Through the above series of work, the situation in the industry has initially improved, but there are still many problems. The merger of fountain pen factories only merged people, and the enterprises themselves have not been merged, and there are contradictions between labor and capital and between capitalists. Therefore, in the third quarter, the Pen Manufacturing Company conducted two merger pilot projects. One of the merged units consisted of seven fountain pen factories and two parts factories, and the other consisted of five parts factories. The seven fountain pen factories originally did not have equipment for manufacturing nibs and compression-molded plastic (raw materials for pen barrels). Now, by merging with two nib and compression-molding factories, the main parts of the fountain pen can be produced by themselves, and the number of people in the factory has also increased to over one hundred. The five parts factories originally all produced nibs, but each factory only had one process for producing nibs, so they could not guarantee quality at all. After the merger, they exchanged resources and became an all-around factory that produced nibs. Production and management in both factories have improved after the merger. Now, the Pen Manufacturing Company has drafted a plan for the overall transformation of the "three pens" industry. According to this draft plan, the gold pen, fountain pen, and parts industries will achieve full public-private partnership in the coming year, and various preparations are actively underway.
　　While carrying out production arrangement and production reorganization work, the Pen Manufacturing Company also directly manages and guides the production and technology of each factory. In the second quarter, it carried out quality and cost comparisons, analyzed the advanced and backward points of each factory, clarified the key problems, and promoted backward factories to learn from advanced factories; it convened technical professional meetings, introduced advanced experiences in major processes such as gold welding, film baking, and iridium tipping, and issued relevant technical materials. After the meeting, it organized small-scale technical experience exchange meetings for various processes to further study and enrich these experiences; it proposed technically-based and fully achievable consumption indicators for major raw materials, as well as the yield rate and return rate, to promote cost reduction in various factories; it unified specification requirements and gradually established quality standards and technical conditions, reducing the two hundred or so brands of private fountain pens to seventeen; in addition to promoting the establishment of inspection systems in various factories, it also organized industry-wide conservation and quality inspections and key inspection systems, with the participation of staff from the Pen Manufacturing Company, employees from various factories, and representatives of capitalists. Carrying out the above work has two important aspects of significance. On the one hand, it promotes factories to improve quality and reduce costs, and thoroughly eliminates the evil consequences of crude manufacturing brought about by blind development; on the other hand, it gradually establishes unified advanced technical standards and technical data, and coordinates with the work of carrying out industry-wide transformation and merging small factories into large factories. At present, the quality of Shanghai gold and fountain pens is improving, and the phenomenon of "the nib is like a knife, the writing doesn't produce ink, and when it does, it's like a tap" has been basically eliminated. After the gold pen factory implemented the quota allocation system for raw materials, the loss rate of major raw materials has been reduced.
　　The most important effect of the production arrangement and preliminary production reorganization of the "three pens" industry is that it has stopped the blind development of capitalism, and thus stopped the intensification of contradictions between the public and private sectors, between labor and capital, between large and small, and between advanced and backward, bringing the production of the "three pens" industry into the orbit of national planning, and laying a preliminary foundation for the implementation of industry-wide transformation. The evil consequences of the anarchic development of capitalism are that a few people get rich, most people go bankrupt, the state loses valuable raw materials and funds, consumers spend money but cannot buy good products, the livelihoods of several thousand workers and tens of thousands of family members are difficult, and public-private relations and labor-capital relations are very tense. After unified arrangements, the difficult situation in the industry has been reversed, and the production of the entire industry has been basically stabilized. Those who were shut down have started operating, and those who were not paid have been paid; especially after the production reorganization, the industry is more organized than before. After the gold pen industry eliminated seven factories, the number of people in each factory is more than sixteen; after the merger of fountain pen factories, the number of factories has been reduced from one hundred and eighty-eight to one hundred, and many factories that were purely assembly plants can now manufacture pen barrels and other parts. In this way, although the output of gold and fountain pens has decreased by 40 percent compared to last year, most factories can still have a surplus or break even.
　　The above facts prove that the establishment of specialized companies like the Pen Manufacturing Company to take charge of the overall industry transformation of capitalist industry and commerce is extremely advantageous.
　　First, the establishment of specialized companies can change the situation where private industry was virtually unregulated in the past, and manage the scattered and huge private industry by industry as a whole. In the past, industrial and commercial administrative departments often only managed industrial and commercial registration and dealt with illegal acts; commercial departments only managed processing and ordering households, and only managed the supply of raw materials and the sale of products for processing and ordering households, and did not manage production; the industrial bureau only managed technology; as for the People's Bank, the Labor Bureau, the Tax Bureau, etc., although they all had some contact with private factories, they were all temporary. Because each industry has its own characteristics, and the various problems in the industry are inherently linked, dividing these problems and having them managed by many departments separately will naturally have little effect and be poorly managed. Now, with the establishment of specialized companies, integrating the functions of industry, commerce, and administration, coupled with close collaboration from various relevant departments, it is possible to manage an industry "as a whole" from start to finish, from arranging and leading production, to guiding technology, and even to economic restructuring and socialist transformation.
　　Second, the organizational form of specialized companies is not only suitable for the current need for unified administrative management of private industry, but also suitable for the requirements of carrying out socialist transformation of private industry by industry. In the past, public-private partnerships were carried out one by one. Now, carrying out socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce on a large scale, this method is obviously not suitable. In the future, the scale of transformation will become larger and larger, and the units will become smaller and smaller. Before implementing public-private partnership, without proper economic reorganization, it will be impossible to implement industry-wide public-private partnership. Therefore, establishing specialized companies before implementing industry-wide public-private partnership, making overall plans, and carrying out various preparations for industry-wide transformation in a planned way can accelerate the speed of transformation.
　　The third benefit of organizing specialized companies is to manage enterprises of various economic types in the industry in a unified way. Although the economic types of each factory are different, the production and technology are still the same. After unified management, it can drive the backward to learn from the advanced, and facilitate the comprehensive summarization and promotion of experience. Moreover, in the industry-wide transformation, many small factories that do not have independent production capacity will inevitably be merged into state-owned factories and old joint ventures. Managing them together in advance will also be more conducive to future mergers.
　　From the initial achievements of the Pen Manufacturing Company, the advantages and necessity of organizing specialized companies can be fully affirmed. However, since this is a new work, there are still some problems in the company's current work that need to be further resolved.

专栏：进一步做好改造资本主义工商业的工作

　　上海“三笔”专业公司
　　洪军
    今年三月，上海市第一轻工业局设立了一个制笔公司，把全市四百多个各种经济类型的金笔、钢笔、铅笔（以下简称“三笔”）工厂，从安排生产、领导生产、指导技术，一直到经济改组和社会主义改造，全部管了起来。它既要负责把整个行业从分散落后、技术低劣的水平，提高到集中、先进的社会主义的生产水平；又要把整个行业从几种经济类型并存的状况改变成为单一的社会主义经济。这个公司既是一个经济机关，又是一个政治机关。它所管的企业虽然目前绝大部分都是私营厂，工作人员中也包括若干工商界人士，但是它是一个社会主义性质的、国家专业性企业的管理机构。
    我国制造“三笔”的工业企业，绝大部分集中在上海。一九五四年，上海“三笔”的产量占全国总产量的比重，金笔为百分之八十点二，钢笔为百分之八十六点三四，铅笔为百分之五十二点六三。上海“三笔”行业是解放以后发展起来的。解放后，随着人民文化生活水平的提高和文化事业的发展，金笔、钢笔曾一度供不应求，而“三笔”工业的设备简单，建厂所用资金不多，利润又高，加上国家过去没有对“三笔”行业进行严格的管理，以致
  “三笔”行业盲目地大量发展起来。如金笔业，在解放前仅有八家小工厂，一九五四年就发展到了三十九家，一九五四年的产量比一九五○年增加了八倍。上海刚解放的时候，只有三十多家钢笔工厂，一九五三年发展到三百四十三家。盲目发展的结果是：产过于求，质量低劣，产品大量积压。到一九五四年年底，全国积压的“三笔”数量，等于一九五三年九个月到十五个月的产量。当时，上海金笔业因产品积压，一般工厂开工率只达百分之二十到三十，钢笔的积压更严重，钢笔业大部分陷于停工和半歇业状态。金笔、钢笔业的困难，也影响了和金、钢笔业协作的零件工厂。由于生产困难，企业亏损，几千个工人的生活不能维持。因此，制笔公司成立后面临的紧急任务，就是把全行业的生产迅速安排下来。
    今年，国家分配给上海全年的“三笔”生产任务，金笔较一九五四年减少了百分之三十七点一，钢笔减少了百分之四十一点○四。制笔公司根据国家分配的生产任务，对各种经济类型工厂的生产任务的分配，作了适当的调整。在金笔业中，地方国营、公私合营、私营三种经济类型的工厂都有困难，而私营的困难更大，根据“统筹兼顾，既要有所不同，又要一视同仁”的方针，就从地方国营、公私合营工厂中抽出了一部分生产任务，来安排私营工厂的生产。这样调整后，私营厂的生产任务平均增加了百分之二十六点八七，公私合营厂和地方国营厂的生产任务平均减少了百分之七到百分之八。地方国营、公私合营内部生产任务不均衡的现象趋于缓和，并且还有利润；私营工厂不仅可以维持生产，而且改进管理以后，还可以略有盈余。制笔公司又根据“奖励先进、照顾落后、淘汰有害”的原则，对产品质量好、受用户欢迎的工厂，不论是什么经济类型，一律多给生产任务，质量差的就少给任务。质量实在低劣无法继续生产金笔的七家工厂则动员它们转业为钢笔厂。
    对于钢笔业生产的安排，就比较复杂。私营钢笔厂有一百八十八家（包括转业的七家金笔厂），九个工人以下的占一百家，其中十四家没有职工，四十二家只有一至三个职工。“一盏煤油灯，两把老虎钳”，就是全部生产工具；资金也大多吃光用净。整个行业没有一个全能工厂，连技术比较先进的工厂，也要三至五个合起来才能做成一枝笔，落后厂就要十五个至二十个厂才能做成一枝笔。对于这些厂，如不结合统筹安排进行生产改组，技术就很难改进，产品质量根本无法保证，即便布置了生产任务，也难以维持下去。
    在同业工会和各区工商行政部门协助之下，制笔公司采取了以下措施：对于有单独生产条件的九十八家工厂先布置了生产任务，使之继续生产；对于那些虽有一些资金，但是设备简陋，没有生产条件，或者虽能生产但是不能保证质量的工厂，就动员他们同有条件的厂合并劳动力，维持生产，再看情况发展，考虑企业合并问题；对于没有资金、设备，技术条件又差，仅有少数从业人员的工厂，就淘汰其企业，设法在大厂中安插其人员，维持生活。利用这些办法淘汰了六十七家小厂，从业人员分别安插到九十一家大厂中，另有二十二家小厂合并成两家较大的厂。合并的工作非常复杂。这次只是先进行劳动力的合并，清产定股企业合并等问题则有意留待以后处理。这样做的好处是有利于迅速恢复生产。
    金笔、钢笔厂的生产安排好了，零件厂就自然地带动起来了。过去零件厂的生产是自由竞争的，产品的质量规格非常混乱，任务多少也苦乐不均。这次大体上按原来协作生产的关系，把零件厂分别同笔厂搭配了起来。同时也按照“奖励先进、照顾落后、淘汰有害”的原则，对生产任务作了部分调整。
    通过以上一系列工作，行业的情况初步好转了，但是问题很多。钢笔厂的合并，只合并了人，企业本身还没有合并，劳资之间、资资之间都有矛盾。因此，制笔公司在第三季度中又搞了两个合并试点。两个合并的单位，一个由七家钢笔厂和两家零件厂组成，一个由五家零件厂组成。七家钢笔厂原来都没有制造笔尖和压塑胶（笔杆原料）的设备，现在同两家笔尖、压塑厂合并，钢笔的几个主要部分已经能够自己生产，工厂的人数也增加到一百以上。五家零件厂原来虽都生产笔尖，但是各厂只具备生产笔尖的一个工序，因而根本无法保证质量，合并后互通有无，成了一家生产笔尖的全能工厂。合并后两厂的生产和管理都有改进。现在，制笔公司已经作出了对“三笔”行业实行全行业改造的规划草案。根据这个规划草案，金笔、钢笔和零件行业将在明年度实现全行业的公私合营，各项准备工作正在积极进行。
    制笔公司在进行生产安排和生产改组工作的同时，还直接管理并指导各厂的生产和技术。在第二季度进行了质量和成本的评比工作，分析了各厂先进和落后之处，明确了问题的关键，带动落后厂向先进厂看齐；召开技术性的专业会议，介绍了焊金、烘片、点铱等主要工种的先进经验，印发了有关的技术资料，会后又组织小型的各工种的技术经验交流会，进一步研究和充实这些经验；提出了有技术根据的、完全可以做到的主要原料消耗指标和出片率、回炉率，推动各厂降低成本；统一规格要求，逐步订立质量标准和技术条件，把私营钢笔厂的二百多种牌号减缩为十七种；除推动各厂建立检验制度外，还组织了全行业性的节约和质量检查、重点检查制度，参加检查的有制笔公司的工作人员、各厂的职工和资方代表。进行上述各项工作有两方面的重要意义。一方面，促使各厂提高质量，降低成本，彻底消除由于盲目发展带来的粗制滥造的恶果；另一方面，逐步建立统一的先进技术标准和技术资料，同进行全行业改造，小厂并大厂的工作步调取得一致。目前上海金笔、钢笔的质量正在提高，“笔尖像小刀，写字不出水，出水像自来水”的现象已经基本上消灭。金笔厂实行限额配料制度以后，主要原料的损耗率已经降低。
    对于“三笔”行业生产安排和初步的生产改组所收到的效果，最主要的是停止了资本主义的盲目发展，也就停止了随之而来的公私之间、劳资之间、大小之间、先进和落后之间矛盾的激烈化，使
  “三笔”行业的生产纳入了国家的计划轨道，为实行全行业改造打下了初步基础。资本主义无政府状态发展的恶果是，少数人发财，多数人破产，国家损失了贵重的原料和资金，消费者花钱买不到好货，几千工人和成万的家属生活困难，公私关系、劳资关系都很紧张。统筹安排以后，行业困难的局面扭转了，全行业的生产基本上稳定下来。停工的开了工，停薪的发了薪；特别是进行了生产改组，行业比过去整齐了。金笔业淘汰了七家以后，各厂人数都在十六人以上；钢笔厂合并后由一百八十八家工厂减为一百家，原来许多纯粹是装配的工厂，现在能够制造笔杆和其他零件。这样，虽然金笔、钢笔的产量比去年减少了百分之四十，但是大部分厂还能有盈余或收支平衡。
    以上事实证明，成立像制笔公司这样的专业公司来主管对资本主义工商业的全行业改造工作，优越性是极大的。
    首先，专业公司的设立，可以改变过去私营工业实际上几乎没有人管的局面，把分散的、庞大的私营工业按行业一揽子管起来。过去，工商行政部门往往只管工商业登记和处理违法行为；商业部门只管加工订货户，而且对加工订货户也只管到原料的供应和产品的销售，不管生产；工业局则只管技术；至于人民银行、劳动局、税务局等，虽然都同私营厂多少有些联系，但是都是临时性的。因为每个行业有自己的特点，行业中的各个问题又有内在的联系，把这些问题分割开来，由许多部门分头去管，自然就效果不大，管理不好。现在设立了专业公司，集工、商、行政等职权于一身，再加上各个有关部门紧密协作，就能够把一个行业“一揽子”地管到底，从安排和领导生产、指导技术，一直管到经济改组和社会主义改造。
    其次，专业公司的组织形式，不但适合于目前对于私营工业统一行政管理的需要，而且适合于对私营工业按行业进行社会主义改造的要求。过去实行公私合营，是一个一个地进行。现在大规模地进行对于资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，这种方式显然就不合适了。今后改造的规模越来越大，单位也越多越小，在实行公私合营以前，不作适当的经济改组，就无法实行全行业的公私合营。因此，在全行业实行公私合营以前就成立专业公司，作出全面规划，有步骤地进行全行业改造的各项准备工作，就能加快改造的速度。
    组织专业公司的第三个好处是把本行业各种经济类型的企业统一地管理起来。各厂经济类型虽然不同，生产和技术还是一致的，统一管理以后，就可以带动落后的向先进的看齐，便于全面地总结推广经验。而且在全行业改造中，许多没有独立生产能力的小厂，势将并入国营厂和老的合营厂，事先把他们一起管理起来，对将来的合并也更加有利。
    从制笔公司获得的初步成绩来看，组织专业公司的优越性和必要性，是完全可以肯定的。但是由于这是一件新的工作，目前这个公司的工作中，还有一些问题需要进一步解决。
