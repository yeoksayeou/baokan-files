    In many workshops of the First Automobile Works, the last three workshops to start installing equipment—the motorcycle workshop, the foundry workshop, and the car body pressing workshop—are now carrying out a large amount of installation work. The chassis workshop, where the equipment installation began earlier, has mostly completed the installation of machinery and equipment, and some workshops have now begun adjusting production. This is the situation of the metal products workshop adjusting production.

    在第一汽车制造厂的许多工场中，最后开始安装设备的三个工场——摩托工场、铸工场、车身压制工场，现在已开展大量的安装工作。安装工程开始较早的底盘工场机器设备已大部安装就绪，有的车间现在已开始调整生产。这是金工属品车间调整生产的情形。
