　　Ideological and political work in factories and mines must be strengthened in order to give full play to the guaranteeing and supervisory role of Party organizations in production. At present, one of the important links in strengthening this work lies in changing the situation in which some Party committee secretaries and full-time staff members monopolize Party work, and actively organizing all Party members to participate in Party work. The guarantee and supervision of production by Party organizations in factories and mines is comprehensive. Party organizations must ensure that the factories and mines they are in adopt proper means to comprehensively fulfill the state plan; supervise the correct implementation of state laws and Party policies and resolutions in their units, and wage uncompromising struggles against all illegal and disciplinary tendencies; Party organizations must also support all inventions, creations, and rationalization proposals of the workers, as well as actively support all correct measures taken by the administrative side, mobilize the masses to ensure the smooth implementation of these measures; supervise the correct use of state funds by the administrative side to accelerate capital turnover, and prevent all phenomena of corruption and waste, etc. The guarantee and supervision of production by Party organizations is not only multifaceted but also active. Party organizations must not only promptly point out shortcomings in the work but also help the administrative side to correct shortcomings and errors in a timely manner; they must study various major issues in advance to prevent deviations and errors from occurring. Obviously, only by relying on the enthusiasm of all Party members, and relying on the enthusiasm of the broad masses with Party members as the core, and concentrating everyone's experience and wisdom, can Party organizations possibly do this work well.

　　Our Party organization is an integral whole organized by all Party members in accordance with the principle of democratic centralism, and any major task of the Party organization should be completed by the joint efforts of all Party members. The responsibility of the Party committee and the secretary is not to monopolize all the work of the Party organization, but to organize and lead all Party members to complete the Party's tasks. If Party organizations in enterprises neglect this principle, they will not be able to accomplish such arduous and complex tasks. In the first four months of this year, the production situation at the 170-meter coal mining face in the South 3rd Lane of the No. 3 Mine of the Jiaohe Coal Mine in Jilin was chaotic, and the state plan was often not fulfilled. At that time, the No. 3 Mine Branch Committee did not pay attention to organizing all Party members and activists to work together to change this chaotic and passive situation, but instead, the branch committee members and administrative cadres squatted in the field to "supervise" production, and as a result, the situation did not improve at all. Later, with the help of the superior Party committee, the branch committee overcame this shortcoming. The branch committee helped Party member Zhang Yao take the initiative to unite five activists to promote advanced experience, which greatly improved the efficiency of the coal cutting machine. Under the leadership of the branch committee, many Party members actively worked in production, took the lead in overcoming departmentalism, and visited workers' homes after work to understand the workers' family lives and ideological conditions, and then reported to the branch. Some Party members also took the initiative to take out their own money to help workers with difficult lives. The branch committee also helped Party members cultivate non-Party activists, so that the number of activists increased from the original twelve to twenty-two. Many workers who were originally ideologically backward became active in production under the help and influence of Party members and activists, and used the facts of their own ideological transformation to educate the surrounding masses. The production situation of this field improved rapidly with the increase of the enthusiasm of the masses. Considering the work of the Party organization as only a matter for a few people, the Party committee secretary and full-time Party workers, it is not possible to discover various problems in economic activities in a timely manner; even if they can be discovered, they are often one-sided; even if the problems are raised correctly, they often fail to attract people's attention because they are the opinions of a few people or individuals. Relying only on a few people or individuals to guarantee and supervise production, the Party organization cannot carry out in-depth and meticulous ideological and political work among the masses, and the Party's political work among the masses will become generalized mobilization and calls, and the Party organization will not be able to organize the broad masses of workers and staff to complete various major tasks. This is the case with the Party organization of the Iron Smelting Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company. From the Party committee of this plant to the branch, they do not pay attention to mobilizing Party members to participate in Party work; some branch secretaries even think that to organize Party members to do work, they have to arrange and explain it themselves, so it is better to do it themselves to save trouble. Therefore, the Party organization of this plant appears very weak and powerless.

　　Understanding the Party organization's guarantee and supervision of production as a matter for the Party committee secretary alone can easily lead to unprincipled disputes between the Party committee secretary and the factory director. Under the domination of this erroneous thinking, some Party committee secretaries mistakenly understand the Party organization's supervision as the secretary's personal supervision of the factory director, and always treat administrative leaders with the attitude of "I" supervising "you". They think that their Party spirit is strong and their level is high, and they are accustomed to using an arrogant attitude to pick on and criticize the work of administrative leaders. Some Party committee secretaries even often simply criticize administrative leaders for being not good here and not right there, as if they cannot show that "I" am supervising "you" without doing so. Many administrative leaders also hold the opposite sentiment of "why should 'you' supervise 'me'", and treat the Party organization's supervision. Some factory directors even compare qualifications, abilities, and so on with the Party committee secretary, and always feel that others are not as good as themselves, and come to the absurd conclusion: "Since 'you' are not as good as 'me', you are not qualified to supervise 'me'". This kind of unprincipled dispute between the factory director and the Party committee secretary is extremely detrimental to the work of the enterprise, and should be eliminated by correcting the view of the Party organization's supervision and strengthening the mass character and collectivity of the Party's supervision.

　　To give play to the enthusiasm of all Party members, first of all, the Party committee should be strengthened. At present, in many enterprises, the members of the Party committee do not care about Party work, especially the Party committee members who are also administrative leaders. Some people say that they are "committee members when the Party committee meets, and not committee members after the meeting is dismissed", which is not an exaggeration. In fact, many Party committee members usually do not care about Party work, and when they attend meetings, they can only sit there and listen to the meeting, and rarely put forward any practical and beneficial opinions. Some of them even treat Party work with an attitude of onlookers, often complaining that the Party organization is not doing this well and that is not right, and rarely do any practical work to help improve Party work, as if the quality of Party work has nothing to do with them, these Party committee members. Communist Party members who are administrative leaders should realize that as Communist Party member administrative cadres, they should consciously and actively accept the supervision of the Party organization over the production and administrative work they lead; as a Party committee member or even an ordinary Party member, they should actively participate in Party work, earnestly do all the work entrusted to them by the Party organization, and actively report various situations to the Party committee, and frequently put forward opinions on improving and strengthening Party work.

　　Organizing all Party members to participate in Party work requires the Party committee to carry out a lot of detailed and specific work. The Party committee should regularly inform Party members and the masses of the Party organization's current major tasks and involve them in making decisions on major issues. Holding Party member congresses, Party congresses, or representative meetings has a great effect in this regard. At these meetings, Party members can criticize the work of the Party and the administrative side, put forward various suggestions for improving the work, and more fully understand the current tasks of the Party organization, and carry out political work in accordance with the resolutions of the congress. However, letting Party members understand the Party's intentions and listening to Party members' opinions should not be limited to these congresses. The members of the Party committee should have more individual contact with Party members and activists, listen to everyone's opinions at any time and place, and accept everyone's criticisms, in order to enrich the leadership work of the Party organization.

　　The Party committee should regularly assign appropriate tasks to Party members according to their specific circumstances, and teach them the methods to complete the tasks. The Party organization's entrustment and help have a great effect on enhancing Party members' confidence and sense of responsibility in participating in Party work. There was a Party member named Wang Dianjun in the Second Workshop Branch of the 53rd Factory. Originally, he had not been concerned about Party work. Later, the branch secretary corrected his incorrect view of Party work and assigned him a task to study the reasons for the uneven production in the workshop and the solutions. Wang Dianjun felt that this was the Party's trust and attention to him. With the specific help of the branch secretary, he completed the task well, and correctly analyzed the various specific reasons for the uneven production in the workshop at the Party member congress of that month, and his opinions were incorporated into the resolution of the Party member congress. Since then, Wang Dianjun has become an activist in Party work. Full-time Party workers should often carry out such work, instead of taking on many tasks themselves.

　　The Party organization should not only inspire and encourage Party members and the masses to frequently put forward various criticisms and suggestions on Party work and administrative work, but also actively try to ensure that all correct suggestions of Party members and the masses can be realized in a timely manner. It should also vigorously support them in fighting against all erroneous ideas and behaviors, and prevent their enthusiasm and initiative from being suppressed and attacked by bureaucrats. Some Party organizations only call on Party members to carry out criticism and self-criticism at Party member congresses or other meetings, but do not pay attention to striving for the effect of criticism, nor do they actively implement the correct and feasible suggestions of Party members. Sometimes, even Party members are attacked and retaliated against for exposing and criticizing the mistakes of certain leaders, and the Party organization does not interfere. As a result, the enthusiasm of Party members is dampened, and the Party life in those enterprises becomes more and more lifeless. Party organizations should do less general calls and do more specific work to support the opinions of Party members and the masses. Only in this way can the enthusiasm of Party members and the masses be fully brought into play, and the Party organization's guarantee and supervision of production will be truly effective.

### 发挥全体党员的积极性  加强企业党组织的工作

　　发挥全体党员的积极性  加强企业党组织的工作
    厂矿企业中的思想政治工作必须加强，才能充分发挥党组织对生产的保证和监督作用。目前，加强这一工作的重要环节之一，在于改变若干党委书记和专职工作人员包办党的工作的状况，积极地组织全体党员来参与党的工作。厂矿企业中的党组织对生产的保证和监督是全面的。党组织要保证所在的厂矿采用正当的手段来全面地完成国家计划；监督所在单位正确地贯彻执行国家的法令和党的各项政策决议，并且同一切违法乱纪等不良倾向进行不调和的斗争；党组织还要支持工人群众的一切发明创造和合理化建议，也要积极地支持行政方面一切正确的措施，动员群众保证这些措施顺利实现；监督行政方面正确地运用国家资金，以加速资金的周转，防止一切贪污浪费现象等等。党组织对生产的保证和监督不仅是多方面的，而且是积极的。党组织不仅要及时地指出工作中的缺点，而且要帮助行政方面及时地改正缺点和错误；要在事先研究各种重大问题，防止发生偏差和错误。很明显的，只有依靠全体党员的积极性，依靠以党员为核心的广大群众的积极性，集中大家的经验和智慧，党组织才有可能做好这些工作。
    我们的党组织是由全体党员按照民主集中制的原则组织起来的整体，党组织的任何重大任务，都应该由全体党员共同努力完成。党的委员会和书记的责任不是包办党组织的全部工作，而是组织和领导全体党员来完成党的各项任务。企业党组织如果忽视了这一原则，他们就没有可能来完成这样艰巨复杂的任务。吉林蛟河煤矿三坑南三道一百七十公尺采煤场子在今年一至四月份中，生产情况混乱，经常完不成国家计划。当时，三坑支部委员会没有注意组织全体党员和积极分子，共同努力改变这种混乱被动的局面，而是由支部委员们和行政干部一起蹲在场子里“监督”生产，结果情况仍然不见丝毫好转。后来，在上级党委帮助下，支部委员会克服了这个缺点。支部委员会帮助党员张尧主动地团结了五名积极分子，推广先进经验，大大地提高了截煤机的效率。在支部委员会领导下，不少党员在生产中积极劳动，带头克服本位主义思想，下班后还到工人家里去访问，了解工人的家庭生活和思想状况，然后向支部汇报。有的党员还主动地拿出自己的钱去帮助生活困难的工人。支部委员会还帮助党员培养非党积极分子，使积极分子由原来的十二名发展到二十二名。有很多原来思想落后的工人，在党员和积极分子的帮助和影响下，生产积极起来，并且用他们自己思想转变的事实去教育周围的群众。这个场子的生产状况就随着群众积极性的提高而迅速地好转了。把党组织的工作只看成党委书记和专职的党工作人员少数人的事情，就不能及时地发现经济活动中的各种问题；即使能够发现，也往往会有片面性；即使问题提得正确，又往往因为它是少数人或个人的意见而不能引起人们的重视。仅只靠少数人或者个人对生产进行保证和监督，党组织就不可能在群众中进行深入的细致的思想政治工作，党在群众中的政治工作就会变成一般化的动员和号召，党组织就没有可能来组织广大的职工群众完成各种重大任务。鞍山钢铁公司炼铁厂的党组织就是这样。从这个厂的党委会到支部，都不注意发动党员参加党的工作；有的支部书记甚至认为要组织党员做工作，还得自己去布置交代，就不如干脆自己干省事得多。因而这个厂的党组织就显得十分软弱无力。
    把党组织对生产的保证和监督，理解为党委书记个人的事情，就很容易引起党委书记和厂长之间的无原则纠纷。在这种错误思想的支配下，有些党委书记把党组织的监督，错误地理解为书记个人对厂长个人的监督，总是用“我”监督“你”的态度来对待行政领导人员。他们自以为自己的党性强、水平高，惯于用盛气凌人的态度去挑剔指责行政领导工作人员的工作。有的党委书记甚至经常单纯地去指责行政领导人员这也不好那也不对，似乎不如此就显示不出是“我”在监督“你”一样。不少行政领导工作人员也就抱着“你”为什么应该监督“我”的对立情绪，去对待党组织的监督。有些厂长甚至去同党委书记比资历，比能力，比来比去，总觉得别人不如自己，而且得出这样荒谬的结论：“你”既然不如“我”，就没有资格来监督“我”。厂长和党委书记间的这种无原则纠纷对于企业的工作是极其不利的，应该从端正对党组织的监督的看法和加强党的监督的群众性和集体性来消除这种无原则纠纷。
    要发挥全体党员的积极性，首先，党的委员会应该健全起来。目前，在不少企业中，党委会的成员不关心党的工作，特别是其中担任行政领导工作的党委委员。有人说他们在“开党委会时是委员，散了会就不是委员了”，这话并不过分。实际上，不少党委委员平时既不关心党的工作，开会时也就只能是坐在那里听会，而很少提出什么切实有益的意见。他们当中有的人还以旁观者的态度来对待党的工作，常常埋怨党组织这个做得不好，那个做得不对，很少做什么实际工作来帮助改进党的工作，似乎党的工作好坏，和他们这些党委委员根本没有关系。担任行政领导工作的共产党员们应该认识到，做为共产党员的行政领导干部，应该自觉地主动地接受党组织对自己所领导的生产、行政工作的监督；做为党委委员甚至一个普通党员，应该积极地参与党的工作，认真地做好党组织委托他的一切工作，主动地向党委会汇报各种情况，经常地提出改进和加强党的工作的意见。
    组织全体党员来参与党的工作需要党委会进行许多细致的具体工作。党委会应该经常使党员群众了解党组织当前的重大任务并参与决定重大问题。开好党员大会、党的代表大会或代表会议，在这方面有很大的作用。党员们在这些会议上可以批评党和行政方面的工作，可以提出各种改进工作的建议，还可以比较充分地了解党组织的当前任务，根据大会的决议来进行政治工作。但是，让党员们了解党的意图并听取党员们的意见，不能只限于这些大会。党委会的委员们应该更多地和党员、积极分子们个别接触，随时随地倾听大家的意见，接受大家的批评，以充实党组织的领导工作。
    党委会应该经常根据党员的具体情况分配给他们适当的任务，教给他们完成任务的方法。党组织的委托和帮助，对于提高党员参与党的工作的信心和责任感有很大的作用。五三工厂二车间支部有一个党员名叫王殿君。原来他一直不关心党的工作。后来支部书记纠正了他对党的工作的不正确的看法，交给他一项任务，要他研究车间生产不均衡的原因和解决的办法。王殿君感到这是党对他的信任和重视。在支部书记的具体帮助下，他很好地完成了任务，在当月的党员大会上正确地分析了车间生产不均衡的各种具体原因，他的意见被吸收到党员大会的决议中去了。从此，王殿君就成为党的工作的积极分子。专职的党工作人员应该经常地进行这样的工作，而不要把许多工作都包揽在自己身上。
    党组织不仅要启发和鼓励党员群众对党的工作和对行政工作经常提出各种批评和建议，而且要积极地设法使党员群众的一切正确的建议都能及时实现。还应该大力支持他们同一切错误思想和行为作斗争，防止他们的热情和积极性受到官僚主义者的压抑和打击。有些党组织只是号召党员们在党员大会或其他会议上展开批评和自我批评，却不注意争取批评的效果，也不积极实现党员们的正确而又可行的建议。有时，甚至党员们因为揭发和批评某些领导者的错误而受到打击和报复，党组织也不加过问。结果就挫伤了党员们的积极性，使那些企业里党的生活越来越没有生气。党组织应该少做些一般的号召，多做些支持党员群众的意见的具体工作。只有这样，党员群众的积极性才能充分发挥，党组织对生产的保证和监督才会是切实有效的。
