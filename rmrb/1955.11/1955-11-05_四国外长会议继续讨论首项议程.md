Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, November 4th (TASS): The Four Foreign Ministers Conference on November 3rd continued to discuss the first item on the agenda, with British Foreign Secretary Macmillan serving as chairman.

The foreign ministers of the three Western powers expressed their views on Molotov's speech at the last meeting regarding European security and the German question, as well as the Soviet government's proposal to establish an All-German Committee.

Dulles stated that his initial impression of the Soviet delegation's position on the German question and the Soviet proposal to establish an All-German Committee was that the Soviet proposal was unacceptable. Dulles attempted to prove that the Soviet proposal did not conform to the spirit of the instructions of the four heads of government. According to him, the Soviet proposal did not stipulate the restoration of German unification, but rather some kind of cooperation between the two German states. Dulles also insisted that the Soviet proposal did not stipulate holding some form of free elections in Germany.

Dulles also stated that he believed the Soviet proposal was a retreat from a proposal made by the Soviet delegation at the Berlin Conference on February 4, 1954, which stipulated that the German people should resolve the social and political system of a democratic Germany without foreign interference. According to Dulles, this view stemmed from the Soviet representative's statement on the 2nd that the political, social, and economic achievements of the working people of the German Democratic Republic must be preserved when unifying Germany.

Dulles also said that the Soviet proposal pre-determined that 50 million Germans would not participate in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Western European Union. He once again insisted, as if the North Atlantic Group and the Western European Union were defensive organizations, that the Federal Republic of Germany's participation in these alliances seemed to place the Federal Republic of Germany's armaments under supervision.

Dulles portrayed the Soviet government's position as a refusal to unify Germany. He once again demanded that the Soviet delegation put forward a so-called proposal to restore German unification through free elections.

Pinay then spoke. He attempted to prove that due to fundamental differences between the two German states, it seemed impossible to establish contact between them. He requested that the Soviet delegation begin studying the Western proposals.

Macmillan stated in his speech that he was disappointed with the Soviet proposal. He said that this document did not mention how the German people could be given the possibility of living in a single country, and he insisted that this proposal was not a proposal to restore German unification. Macmillan insisted that there was only one proposal regarding the issue of restoring German unification submitted to the conference, namely the "Eden Plan," and that the Soviet government's views on this issue were not reflected in the conference.

Macmillan suggested trying to study the "Eden Plan" once again, believing that this plan could satisfy all the requirements put forward by the Soviet government.

Macmillan said that the plan for a unified Germany should meet three criteria. These criteria are: first, German unification should be achieved as soon as possible; second, German unification should be achieved under conditions acceptable to the German people; and third, German unification should conform to the task of ensuring European security. Macmillan explained how the "Eden Plan" "meets all these requirements."

Macmillan said that he believed the All-German Committee was not an institution that could promote the early unification of Germany, and its establishment meant postponing German unification for many years. He said that it was also unclear how this committee would be composed. If the All-German Committee was composed of representatives appointed by the two parliaments, then the British government did not consider the East German parliament to be a freely elected representative body. He added that if the committee's decisions were to be taken on the principle of unanimous agreement, then it would not be a democratic institution, because in this institution, a minority could exercise a veto.

Molotov then spoke. Molotov first pointed out that the series of proposals put forward by the Soviet Union since the beginning of the conference had fully answered the questions raised in the instructions of the four heads of government. Molotov refuted the claim that the Soviet proposal to establish an All-German Committee did not conform to the instructions of the four heads of government, and pointed out that the Soviet Union's attitude towards the German question was different from that at the Berlin Conference in 1954. This was because significant changes had taken place in Germany in the year and a half since then. West Germany was rapidly re-militarizing and had joined the Western military bloc. The two Germanys were developing in different directions, which could not but affect the proposals put forward by the Soviet Union and the conclusions that the Soviet Union must draw from this fact.

Molotov then talked about the issue of free elections in Germany. He pointed out that Hitler was raised and imposed on the German people through all the formal procedures of all-German elections. Now, what guarantee is there that a new Hitler will not emerge? Molotov pointed out that it was no accident that the Yalta Conference and the Potsdam Conference, attended by the heads of government of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, decided not to allow Germany to embark on the old road of militarism again. It was also no accident that the instructions of the four heads of government stipulated that the resolution of the German question and the work of reunifying Germany should be realized in compliance with the national interests of the German people and the interests of European security through free elections. This attitude must be adopted in dealing with the resolution of the German question and the issue of German elections.

Molotov refuted the claim that there were no free elections in the German Democratic Republic and those remarks that belittled the significance of the German Democratic Republic's elections based on a single list. He pointed out that this kind of election precisely showed that the majority of residents in eastern Germany firmly supported the current system and the current government of the German Democratic Republic. At the same time, Molotov pointed out that in dealing with the issue of all-German elections, it was not necessary to pre-negotiate certain procedures for the elections. This was a matter for the German people themselves.

Molotov then analyzed the positions of the three Western countries. He pointed out that the positions of the three countries did not take into account the recent changes in the German question, and had instead changed compared to the positions at the four-power summit held not long ago. At the four-power summit, Britain suggested establishing a region for limiting and supervising armaments "between East and West" in accordance with the current factual situation, but now the West is suggesting establishing a region through the border between Germany and other countries, and this border does not yet exist. This is not in line with the proposals at the four-power summit.

Molotov pointed out that the draft tripartite treaty links the resolution of the German question not only with the re-militarization of Germany, but also with Germany's compulsory accession to the Western military bloc. The draft tripartite treaty does not provide guarantees for the security of the Soviet Union and other European countries.

Molotov said: We find it difficult to consider the proposals put forward by Western countries to be satisfactory, basic security proposals.

Molotov finally mentioned the Soviet proposal to establish an all-German body. He responded to Macmillan's assertion that it was inappropriate to establish an all-German body, pointing out that unwillingness to consider establishing an all-German body was tantamount to not taking practical steps that could be taken at present to unify Germany and prepare for a final resolution of the German question. He also pointed out that those who criticize the Soviet proposal cannot put forward proposals that can actually promote the work of resolving the German question. Molotov emphasized that the establishment of an all-German body may be a realistic step towards resolving the German question.

Next, Macmillan expressed his gratitude to Molotov for noting the criticisms made by the British delegation regarding the Soviet proposal on the German question.

Macmillan said, "I think we have made achievements in the discussion of the German question, and we still have time to make further progress before tomorrow's meeting."

The meeting adjourned at this point. The ministers will continue to meet on November 4th. (Attached image)

### 四国外长会议继续讨论首项议程

    四国外长会议继续讨论首项议程
    新华社四日讯　塔斯社日内瓦四日讯：十一月三日的四国外交部长会议继续讨论第一项议程，会议由英国外交大臣麦克米伦担任主席。
    西方三国外交部长就莫洛托夫在上次会议上关于欧洲安全和德国问题的发言和苏联政府关于成立全德委员会的建议表示了他们的看法。
    杜勒斯说，他对苏联代表团对德国问题的立场和苏联关于建立全德委员会的建议的初步印象是：苏联的建议是无法接受的。杜勒斯企图证明苏联的建议不符合四国政府首脑的指示的精神。据他说，苏联建议所规定的不是恢复德国统一，而是两个德意志国家之间的某种合作。杜勒斯还硬说苏联的建议没有规定在德国举行某种形式的自由选举。
    杜勒斯还说，他认为苏联的建议是从一九五四年二月四日柏林会议上苏联代表团提出的一项建议后退了，那项建议规定德国人民在不受外国干涉的情况下解决一个民主的德国的社会和政治制度的问题。据杜勒斯说，他这种看法是从苏联代表在二日的发言中指出在统一德国的时候必须保留德意志民主共和国劳动人民的政治、社会和经济的成就一点得来的。
    杜勒斯还说，苏联的建议预先规定了五千万德国人不参加北大西洋公约和西欧联盟。他再一次坚持，似乎北大西洋集团和西欧联盟是防御性质的组织，说德意志联邦共和国参加这些联盟似乎是把德意志联邦共和国的军备放在监督之下。
    杜勒斯把苏联政府的立场说成是拒绝统一德国的立场。他再次要求苏联代表团提出所谓通过自由选举恢复德国统一的建议。
    比内接着发言。他试图证明由于两个德意志国家之间有着根本性的不同，似乎就不能在它们之间建立接触。他要求苏联代表团着手研究西方的建议。
    麦克米伦在发言中表示，他对苏联的建议很失望。他说，这个文件一点也没有谈到怎样才可以赋予德国人民在单一的国家里生活的可能性，他硬说这个建议不是恢复德国统一的建议。麦克米伦硬说，向会议提出的只有一个关于恢复德国统一问题的建议，即“艾登计划”，会议上没有反映苏联政府对这个问题的观点的建议。
    麦克米伦建议，设法再研究一次“艾登计划”，他认为这个计划可以满足苏联政府所提出的全部要求。
    麦克米伦说，统一德国的计划应当符合三个标准。这些标准就是：第一、德国的统一应当尽速实现，第二、德国的统一应当在德国人民可以接受的条件下实现，第三、德国的统一应当符合于保障欧洲安全的任务。麦克米伦解释“艾登计划”是如何地“符合所有这些要求”。
    麦克米伦说，他认为全德委员会不是一个能够促成德国早日统一的机构，它的建立意味着把德国的统一推迟许多年。他说，这个委员会究竟怎样组成也还不明确。如果是由两个议会委派自己的代表参加全德委员会，那么，英国政府并不认为东德的议会是自由选出的有代表性的机构。他补充说，如果这个委员会的决定将按一致同意的原则而采取的话，那末它就不会是一个民主的机构，因为在这个机构中少数可以行使否决权。
    莫洛托夫接着发言。莫洛托夫首先指出：苏联从会议开始以来提出的一系列的建议，已经对四国政府首脑指示中提出的问题作了充分的答复。莫洛托夫驳斥了所谓苏联关于成立全德委员会的建议不符合四国政府首脑的指示的说法，并且指出：苏联现在对德国问题的态度同一九五四年柏林会议时有所不同，这是因为德国在一年半以来已经发生了重大变化，西德在迅速地重新军国主义化并且已经加入了西方的军事集团，两个德国正在朝着不同的方向发展，这就不能不对苏联提出的建议和苏联对这个事实一定要作出的结论产生影响。
    莫洛托夫接着谈到德国自由选举的问题。他指出：希特勒就是通过全德选举的一切形式上的手续而被抬出来强加在德国人民头上的。现在，有什么保证不会出现新的希特勒呢？莫洛托夫指出：美、英、苏政府首脑参加的雅尔塔会议和波茨坦会议决定不许德国再走上军国主义的老路，并不是偶然的。四国政府首脑的指示规定德国问题的解决和重新统一德国的工作应该在符合德国人民的民族利益和欧洲安全的利益的情况下通过自由选举来实现，也不是偶然的。必须以这种态度来对待德国问题的解决和德国选举的问题。
    莫洛托夫驳斥了所谓德意志民主共和国没有自由选举的说法和那些贬低德意志民主共和国按照单一的名单进行选举的意义的言论。他指出这种选举正说明德国东部大多数居民坚定地支持德意志民主共和国目前的制度和目前的政府。同时，莫洛托夫指出：在对待全德选举问题上，没有必要预先商定选举的某些程序。这是德国人民自己的事情。
    莫洛托夫接着分析了西方三国的立场。他指出：三国的立场并没有考虑到最近在德国问题方面发生的变化，而同不久以前举行的四国政府首脑会议上的立场相比反而有了变化。英国在四国政府首脑会议上建议在“东西方之间”按照目前的事实情况建立一个限制和监督军备的地区，但是现在西方建议建立一个通过德国同其他国家的分界线的地区，而这条分界线是现在还不存在的。这是不符合四国政府首脑会议上的提议的。
    莫洛托夫指出：三国条约草案使德国问题的解决不但同德国的重新军国主义化联系起来，而且同德国必须加入西方军事集团联系起来。三国条约草案没有对苏联和欧洲其他国家的安全提供保证。
    莫洛托夫说：我们很难认为西方国家提出的建议是令人满意的、关于基本的安全的建议。
    莫洛托夫最后提到苏联提出的关于建立全德机构的建议，他答复了麦克米伦硬说建立全德机构是不适宜的这种说法，指出不愿意考虑建立一个全德机构，就等于没有采取为统一德国和准备最后解决德国问题在目前能够采取的实际步骤，并且指出批评苏联建议的人提不出可以实际推动解决德国问题的工作的建议。莫洛托夫着重说：建立全德机构可能是解决德国问题的现实的步骤。
    接着，麦克米伦表示感谢莫洛托夫注意到了英国代表团对苏联关于德国问题的建议所提的批评意见。
    麦克米伦说，我认为，我们在德国问题的讨论中已经有了成就，在明天举行会议以前我们还有时间获得进一步的进展。
    会议到此休会。部长们将在十一月四日继续举行会议。（附图片）
