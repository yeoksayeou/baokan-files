    While in Guangzhou, the delegation visited the Exhibition of Achievements of Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction and the Guangzhou Export Commodities Fair. They also visited Yuexiu Mountain and Huanghuagang.
    During their stay in China, the delegation visited Shenyang, Anshan, Fushun, Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places.
    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, November 2nd. Masao Tajima, the head of the Japanese business delegation, issued a written statement when he left Shenzhen for home on the 1st, stating that the delegation would work to eliminate artificial trade barriers and fulfill the trade contracts signed in Beijing after returning home.
    Tajima Masao's statement said that the delegation's visit to China,
  “will not only have a certain effect on promoting Sino-Japanese trade in the future, but also have a positive impact on developing friendly relations and establishing normal diplomatic relations between the two countries.”
    The statement said when discussing the gains of the delegation's visit to China: "During our stay in China, many members of the delegation signed a number of contracts with relevant parties of Chinese foreign trade, with a total import and export value of more than 12 million pounds. Both parties also signed a protocol on the basis of exchanging similar materials and balancing imports for the contracts signed above. These achievements mean that a new stage has been opened in the development of Sino-Japanese trade."
    The statement also said: "Although the contracts we signed this time also included a lot of ships and steel products, etc., and these commodities are still within the scope of embargoes, we can only sign reservation contracts. However, we will work to eliminate such artificial barriers and fulfill the contracts."
    The statement, when discussing impressions of visiting various parts of China, expressed its firm belief that the development of China's economic construction will be conducive to expanding trade between China and Japan, and will also be beneficial to the development of Japanese industry. The statement said: "After arriving in Beijing, we visited Shenyang, Fushun, Anshan, Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places, and visited factories and rural areas, which enabled us to understand that China is moving towards industrialization in accordance with the first five-year economic construction plan, and at the same time, the people's living standards are constantly improving. We sincerely hope for the success of this plan, and we are convinced that this will inevitably expand trade between the two countries, which is also of great benefit to the development of our country's industry."
    The statement concluded: "Our delegation participated in the grand celebration of China's National Day in Beijing, which deeply educated us. We deeply feel the prosperity of China and the unity of the people. The various achievements we have made on this trip are mainly due to the sincere friendship and assistance expressed by the Chinese side. We express our deep gratitude."

    日本工商界访华代表团离广州回国
    田岛正雄发表声明愿努力促进中日贸易
    新华社广州一日电　以团长田岛正雄为首的日本工商界访华代表团一日晨离广州回国。
    代表团在广州时，曾参观了苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会、广州市出品物资展览交流会，还到越秀山、黄花岗等处游览。
    代表团在中国期间，曾先后到沈阳、鞍山、抚顺、天津、上海等地进行了广泛的参观访问。
    新华社广州二日电　日本工商界访华代表团团长田岛正雄一日离开深圳回国时发表书面声明，表示代表团在回国后要为消除人为的贸易障碍和履行在北京签订的贸易合同而努力。
    田岛正雄的声明说：代表团这次来中国访问，
  “不仅对今后促进中日贸易上会起一定的效果，同时对发展两国的友好关系和建立正常的外交关系也将给予良好的影响。”
    声明在谈到代表团访问中国的收获时说：“在我们逗留中国的日子里，代表团的许多团员曾同中国对外贸易的有关方面签订了不少合同，进出口总值达一千二百多万英镑，双方并就上述所签订的合同，根据同类物资相易、进口平衡原则签订了议定书。这些成就意味着在中日贸易发展过程中开辟了一个新的阶段。”
    声明又说：“虽然我们在这次签订的合同中，还包括了不少的船舶和钢铁制品等，而这些商品在目前还属于禁运范围，因此只能签订预约性合同，但是我们要为排除这种人为的障碍和履行合同而努力。”
    声明在谈到访问中国各地的观感时，表示深信中国经济建设的发展，将有利于扩大中日两国间的贸易，并有利于日本的工业发展。声明说：“我们在到达北京后，曾先后去沈阳、抚顺、鞍山、天津、上海等地访问，参观了工厂和农村，使我们了解到中国正在按照第一个五年经济建设计划走向工业化，同时人民的生活也在不断提高，我们衷心的希望这一计划的成功，并确信因此必将使两国的贸易扩大，这对我国的工业发展也是有很大利益的。”
    声明最后说：“我们代表团在北京参加中国国庆的盛典，使我们受到了深刻的教育，我们深深地感觉到中国国家的繁荣和人民的团结。我们此行所获的各种成果，主要是由于中国方面所表示出的诚挚友谊和协助的结果，我们特表示深厚的谢意。”
