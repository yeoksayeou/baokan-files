How to Convey Comrade Mao Zedong's Instructions to Rural Party Members
中共藁城县委会 (The Chinese Communist Party Gaocheng County Committee)

    When Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions "on the question of agricultural cooperation" were transmitted to Gaocheng County, Hebei Province, the eight members of the Gaocheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and other cadres equivalent to county committee members went to seven districts respectively. They used the district as a unit to convey the instructions to district committees, cadres in charge of collectivization, resident instructors, and secretaries of township general branches and village branch secretaries. Subsequently, the county committee selected 107 cadres from the county and district section and division chief level cadres who were competent for this task. They used the township as a unit and took two to three days to convey the instructions to Party members in all 96 townships of the county. According to statistics from six districts (excluding Chengguan District), a total of 6,225 rural Party members heard the transmission, accounting for 81.3 percent of the total number of Party members in the county.

    Before conveying Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions, the Gaocheng County Committee made relatively full preparations. In the preparation work, the first step was to strictly select Party member cadres who were truly competent and conduct a short-term training for them so that they could fully understand the spirit of the instructions. This was the key to whether the transmission could be carried out well. After the cadres transmitting the instructions understood the spirit of the instructions, how could they speak correctly and comprehensively and enable rural Party members to understand and comprehend them thoroughly? This required linking with reality during the transmission; without linking with reality, rural Party members would not easily understand. But what should be linked? And how should it be linked? This required preparing materials in advance and writing drafts. When explaining, the actual materials to be linked should be separated from the original words of the instructions. After reading a section of the instructions, actual materials should be used to explain them; under no circumstances should one improvise and make random connections. While conveying Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions, county and district leaders also conducted practical self-criticism on the erroneous ideas and shortcomings in the specific implementation of policies in the local cooperative movement, in accordance with the spirit of the instructions. During the self-criticism, the emphasis was on checking the leadership and avoiding pushing all responsibility to grassroots cadres.

    After the transmission, conscientiously organizing Party members to conduct discussions is an important part of correctly understanding the spirit of Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions and conducting self-education. Gaocheng County conveyed Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions to Party members on a township basis. During the discussions, they were deliberated in village groups, and problems were summarized and answered centrally in a timely manner, and then returned to village groups for continued discussion. Some townships in Nandong District organized Party members to discuss on a cooperative basis. This grouping method facilitated the connection with reality during the discussion. Cadres and key personnel leading the discussion must clearly understand the purpose and requirements of the discussion in advance in order to correctly guide the discussion. Cadres from the work teams and the main Party cadres from townships and villages should go deep into the groups to participate in the discussion and answer difficult questions; however, it should be noted that questions that cannot be answered should not be answered randomly. The questions can be recorded, and then answered after collective discussion or asking for instructions from higher authorities.

    Before the transmission, mobilization work should be done to ensure that Party members arrive on time to listen. Before the transmission, Nandong District first convened a meeting of general branch members, branch committee members, and group leaders at the township level to explain the great significance of this transmission. The Party members happily said, "We must listen to Chairman Mao's instructions no matter what." Some districts also arranged the time for the meeting according to the busy and slack farming seasons to ensure that the transmission and production were not delayed.

    Of course, this transmission of Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions "on the question of agricultural cooperation" in Gaocheng County is only the beginning of implementing these instructions. In the future, it is necessary to continue to implement them in actual work to guide the correct development of the cooperative movement.

    怎样向农村党员传达毛泽东同志的指示
    中共藁城县委会
    当毛泽东同志“关于农业合作化问题”的指示传达到河北省藁城县的时候，中共藁城县委的八位委员和相当于县委委员的其他干部就分别到七个区，以区为单位向区委、整社干部、驻乡指导员和乡总支部书记、村分支部书记作了传达。接着县委又在县、区的科、股长级干部中，挑选了能够胜任这项工作的一百零七名干部，以乡为单位，用二、三天时间，向全县九十六个乡的党员作了传达。根据六个区的统计（缺城关区），听到传达的农村党员共有六千二百二十五名，占全县党员总数的百分之八十一点三。
    在传达毛泽东同志指示以前，藁城县委作了比较充分的准备工作。在准备工作中，首先是严格选择确实能够胜任的党员干部，并且对他们进行了一次短期训练，使他们能够全面地领会指示的精神，这是能不能传达得好的关键。传达的干部对指示精神领会以后，又怎样才能讲得正确、全面，而且使农村党员听得懂，理解得透彻呢？这就要在传达的时候，联系实际；不联系实际，农村党员是不容易听懂的。但是要联系什么？怎样联系？这就必须事前准备好材料，写好草稿。讲解的时候，联系的实际材料要和指示的原话分开，每读一段指示，再联系实际材料进行解释；绝不能信口开河乱联系。在传达毛泽东同志指示的同时，县区领导还根据指示的精神，对当地合作化运动中的错误想法和具体执行政策中的缺点，进行切实的检讨。检讨的时候，着重检查了领导，切忌把责任都推给基层干部。
    传达后，认真地组织党员进行讨论，是正确领会毛泽东同志指示精神，进行自我教育的重要一环。藁城县向党员传达毛泽东同志指示是以乡为单位进行的；讨论的时候，分村分组酝酿，发现问题及时归纳起来集中解答，再回村分组继续讨论。南董区有的乡以合作社为单位组织党员讨论，这种分组的方法，便于讨论的时候联系实际。领导讨论的干部和骨干，对讨论的目的和要求，事前必须弄明确，以便正确地引导讨论。工作组的干部和乡、村主要党员干部都要深入小组参加讨论，解答疑难问题；但应当注意，不能解答的问题不要乱解答，可以把问题记下来，经过集体讨论或者请示上级以后再解答。
    在传达以前要做好动员工作，保证党员按时到齐听讲。南董区在传达以前首先以乡为单位召开了总支委员、分支委员和小组长会议，说明这次传达的重大意义，党员都高兴地说：“无论如何也得听听毛主席的指示。”有些区也根据农作忙闲，安排了开会的时间，保证传达和生产两不误。
    当然，藁城县这次传达毛泽东同志“关于农业合作化问题”的指示，还只是贯彻执行这一指示的开始，今后必须在实际工作中继续贯彻执行，以指导合作化运动正确地发展。
