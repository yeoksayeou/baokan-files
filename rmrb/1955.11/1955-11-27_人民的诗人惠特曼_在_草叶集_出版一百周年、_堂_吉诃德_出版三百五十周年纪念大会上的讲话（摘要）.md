　　The People's Poet Whitman
　　——Speech at the Centennial Celebration of the Publication of "Leaves of Grass" and the 350th Anniversary of the Publication of "Don Quixote" (Abstract)
　　American Singer Aobulei Panqi
　　It is a great honor for me to be able to speak here tonight to praise an American, Walt Whitman, of whom the whole world can be proud. Whitman believed that America was a land for the enjoyment of the broad masses of the people. Although bound by certain bourgeois traditions, he strove to break free from that environment and sang of an America built by the people for themselves with boundless material wealth.
　　He admired freedom for the majority, not for the few. He was a passionate advocate of the abolition of slavery and fought against its evils. He supported Lincoln's struggle against slavery, especially the enslavement of black people. He opposed the policy of bourgeois groups to provoke one minority group to confront another in order to exploit both sides, just as they have consistently pursued in the United States in the past and present. He saw that this rich new land could bring unparalleled prosperity to everyone and demanded that people be free to build it up. He once said, "Where freedom has not sucked the blood of slavery, slavery will suck the blood of freedom." He aided blacks, aided slaves, and actively fought against enslavement. He believed that man exploiting man was an evil, and that those who exploited others would ultimately destroy themselves. He saw pioneers entering the West, establishing new politics, new literature, new beliefs, new inventions, and arts. He saw ships carrying immigrants to and fro, building farms and metropolises with steel mills; he also saw locomotives striding forward, puffing steam; and miners developing underground resources, countless factories, and countless people in various industries wearing work clothes; they joined hands to build a land for them all, not just for a few.
　　Critics of Whitman use the weaknesses inherent in his bourgeois background and thought to diminish the importance of his writings and philosophy. They recognized that Whitman was born with a love for the people and was earnestly seeking answers to solve their problems. They attacked him, ignored him, and did everything they could to stifle his writings. They knew that if Whitman found the answers, he would impart them to the people, and these answers could be harmful to their group. Whitman's inability to make a living from writing, his having to print his own books, and the lack of understanding of his writings by his own countrymen were all part of the same picture.
　　It is significant that the average American student and adult knows far less about Walt Whitman than the average non-American. It is no accident that a small political group in America attempts to suppress the ideas and beliefs of anyone who advocates the unity of all peoples, the freedom of the people, and that the nation's prosperity should be enjoyed by the people. It is this group that prevents another great American, Paul Robeson, from being here tonight so that people can hear his voice. It is also this small group that, to satisfy its own purposes, has always sought to suppress the calls against oppressing the people and for peaceful coexistence. Many Americans are not very familiar with the national heroes of their country, the fighters of their country who fought for the people, such as Walt Whitman, Tom Paine, Frederick Douglass, Henry George, Thorstein Veblen, and countless others who wrote and fought against the suppression of freedom. Few people also know that the first person to sacrifice for the American Revolution was a free American black man, Crispus Attucks.
　　Yes, Walt Whitman has always been considered too revolutionary by a small ruling group in America and overseas, precisely because of his faith in the people, in his country, and in the friendship between human beings, which he has always tirelessly praised. But Whitman not only had faith in America, he also had faith in the progress of the people of the world and the unity of all nations. He believed that imperialism exploiting the people was fundamentally wrong. He believed that war was destructive, and that people are special because they have vitality and contribute to the cause of improving society and the people. He saw democracy, the people's democracy, just like the democracy in our people's democratic countries today. Let me tell you in Whitman's own words. He said: Poets to come! Orators, singers, musicians to come! Not to-day is to justify me and answer what I am for, But you, a new brood, native, athletic, continental, greater than before known, Arouse! for you must justify me. I myself but write one or two indicative words for the future, I but advance a moment only to wheel and hurry back into the darkness. I am a man who, sauntering along without fully stopping, turns a casual look upon you and then averts his face, Leaving it to you to prove and define it, Expecting the main things from you.

　　人民的诗人惠特曼
　　——在“草叶集”出版一百周年、“堂·吉诃德”出版三百五十周年纪念大会上的讲话（摘要）
　　美国歌唱家　奥布雷·潘基
    今天晚上我能在这里发言赞扬一位全世界所能引以为荣的美国人——华尔特·惠特曼，这是很大的荣幸。惠特曼认为美国是一块归广大人民享用的大地。他这个人，虽然受到了某种资产阶级传统的束缚，却努力在摆脱那种环境，并且歌唱一个由人民用无限的物质财富为自己而建设的美国。
    他景仰那为多数人而不是为少数人的自由。他是热情主张废止奴隶制度的，并为反对它的罪恶进行斗争。他支持林肯反对奴隶制度，特别是黑人奴隶占有制的斗争。他反对资产阶级集团挑拨一个少数民族去对抗另一个少数民族以便从中对双方进行剥削的政策，正像他们现在和过去在美国所一贯奉行的。他看到这一块富足的新土地可给大家带来无比的繁荣，要求人们能够自由地把它建设起来。他曾经说：“哪里自由没有抽奴隶制度的血液，奴隶制度就要在哪里抽自由的血液。”他援助黑人，援助奴隶，积极地为反对奴役而斗争。他相信人剥削人是一种罪恶，并认为剥削他人者终会自取灭亡。他看到开拓者进入了西方，建立新的政治，新的文学，新的信仰，新的发明和艺术。他看到了轮船载着移民来来去去，去建设农场和有着钢铁厂的大都市；他又看到了喷着气迈进的火车头；还有开发地下富源的矿工，数不尽的工厂，数不清的穿着工作服的各行各业的人们；他们手携着手建设起一个为他们大伙儿，而不是只为少数人的一块大地。
    批评惠特曼的人们利用他的资产阶级背景和思想所赋予他的弱点，来贬低他的著作和哲学的重要性。他们认识到惠特曼这个人生来就热爱人民，并且认真地在寻求给人民解决问题的答案。他们打击他，漠视他，尽了一切力量来钳制他的著作。他们知道惠特曼如果找到了答案就会传授给人民，而这种答案对他们这种集团是能够发生危害的。惠特曼不能靠写作维持生活，他只好自己印行书籍，还有本国同胞对于他的著作缺乏了解——这些都是同一幅画的一部分。
    一般美国学生和成年人对于华尔特·惠特曼的了解，远远不如一般非美籍的人士，这是一件意味深长的事。谁主张各族人民的团结，人民的自由，以及国家的繁荣应归人民来享有，美国的一小撮政治集团就企图压制他的这种思想和信念，这不是偶然的。正是这个集团使得另一位伟大的美国人——保罗·罗伯逊——今天晚上不能来到这里，让人们听到他的声音。也正是这个小集团，为了满足自己的目的，始终想把反对压迫人民、拥护和平共处的呼声压制下来。许多美国人对于祖国的民族英雄，对于为人民而进行斗争的祖国的战士，像华尔特·惠特曼，汤姆·潘恩，弗雷德里克·道格拉斯，亨利·乔治，索斯坦·弗勃伦和无数其他为反抗压制自由而写作、而进行斗争的人士，却不大认识。也很少有人知道，第一个为美国革命而牺牲的是一个自由的美国黑人——克利斯巴斯·阿特克斯。
    是的，华尔特·惠特曼向来被美国和海外的一小撮统治集团认为太富于革命性了，还不是因为他对人民、对祖国和对人类之间的友爱是有信念的，是始终不息地赞美着的。但是惠特曼不仅对美国有信念，他对全世界人民的进步、各国人民的团结一致都抱着信念。他认为帝国主义那样剥削人民是根本不对的。他认为战争是毁灭性的，他认为人之所以特殊是由于他们有生命力，对于改进社会和人民的事业有所贡献。他看到了民主，人民的民主，正如今天我们人民民主国家的民主。且让我用惠特曼自己的话来告诉你们吧。他这样说：未来的诗人们哟！未来的演说家，歌者，音乐家哟！今天不能给我公正的评价，也不能回答我存在的意义
    是什么，可是你们，土生的，强力的，大陆的，比从来更为伟
    大的新的一群，起来呀！因为你们必需给我以公正的评价。我自己将只写下一二指示着将来的字，我只将露面片刻，便转身急忙退到黑暗中去。我好比是一个不停的漫步着的人，偶然向你们看一眼，立刻又转过脸去，一切留下让你们证明，让你们去解释，对一切主要的东西，把希望寄托在你们身上。
