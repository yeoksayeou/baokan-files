    Handling Old Things with New Methods

    Some handicraft workers in Shanghai specialize in taking old sweaters, disassembling, washing, re-carding, and re-spinning the yarn to knit new sweaters; they also remake old adult leather shoes into new children's leather shoes.

    The Shenyang Third Sewing Production Cooperative uses old cloth to remake "renovated clothing." Cotton cloth garments cost only 3.5 yuan apiece, and they are said to be durable and inexpensive, so sales are very strong.

    The Beijing Cooperative organized unemployed workers to make socks from old sock tubes. These socks sell for only 20-30 cents a pair. In Wuxi, some housewives specialize in re-knitting two pairs of old socks into one new pair, or altering long socks into short socks, or large socks into small socks, charging only 20 cents per pair for labor.

    In the anti-waste movement, the Yangzhou Native Produce Company cleared out a large number of waste and old materials and set up a special "Waste Product Consignment Store." Although they sell old wooden boxes, old sheet metal, and old jars and cans, business is particularly lively. This has motivated the employees of the Native Produce Company to value waste products, collecting even a scrap of waste paper or a nail and sending it to the consignment store.

    This is a very thoughtful service for consumers, and the masses welcome it. It is also a good way to increase production and practice economy. The Shenyang Third Sewing Cooperative sewed more than 34,000 pieces of "renovated clothing," which can save 150,000 feet of new cloth. The cooperative also had a surplus of more than 10,000 yuan in the first seven months of this year. The Beijing Cooperative organized more than 50 unemployed workers to knit old socks, which can save more than 42,000 catties of new cotton yarn each year.

    It can be seen that there are many ways to save, and using new methods to handle old things is one way to save.

    用新办法处理旧东西
    上海有些手工业者，专门替人把旧毛衣经过拆洗、重弹重纺，织成新毛衣；把大人的旧皮鞋改成小孩的新皮鞋。
    沈阳第三缝纫生产合作社利用旧布翻改“更新服装”棉布衣只要三元五一件，据说耐用也便宜，销路很大。
    北京市合作社组织失业工人利用旧袜筒制袜子，这种袜子一双只卖两三角钱。无锡有的家庭妇女，专门替人把两双旧袜子合织成一双新袜子，或者长袜改短袜，大袜改小袜，每双工钱只要两角。
    扬州土产公司在反浪费运动中，清理出大批废旧器材，专门设了一个“废品代销店”，卖的虽是旧木箱、旧铁皮、旧的坛坛罐罐，生意却特别热闹。推动土产公司职工重视废品，一张废纸，一根钉子都收集起来送到代销店去。
    这是对消费者十分周到的服务，群众很欢迎。这也是增产节约的好办法，沈阳第三缝纫社缝了三万四千多件“更新服装”，可以节省新布十五万尺，该社今年七个月还盈余一万多元。北京市合作社组织五十多失业工人织旧袜，每年可以节省新棉纱四万二千多斤。
    可见节约的办法很多，用新办法来处理旧东西，就是一个节约办法。
