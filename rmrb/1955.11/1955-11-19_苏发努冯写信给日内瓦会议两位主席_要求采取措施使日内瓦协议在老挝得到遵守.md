Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 18th. Prince Souphanouvong, representative of the Lao Fighting Units, wrote to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference, Eden and Molotov, on November 10th, explaining the serious situation currently threatening the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Laos and clarifying the Lao Fighting Units' position on this serious situation.

In his letter, Souphanouvong cited relevant clauses of the Geneva Accords, stating that Phongsaly and Sam Neua provinces were designated as assembly areas for the Lao Fighting Units and were under their control until a political settlement was reached by both sides.

The letter stated that before the ceasefire on August 6, 1954, the French Union forces and the Royal Army had completely withdrawn from Phongsaly and Sam Neua provinces. However, soon after, they took advantage of the ceasefire to redeploy troops, airdrop men, and infiltrate the two provinces, launching continuous attacks on the Lao Fighting Units. The Ceasefire Agreement of March 9, 1955, was not respected and implemented by the Royal Government. The Ceasefire Agreement signed in Rangoon on October 11, 1955, once again stipulated that both sides must cease hostilities in the two provinces by October 21, 1955. However, the Royal Government not only did not cease hostilities but continued to move new troops into Phongsaly and Sam Neua provinces, launching vigorous attacks on the Lao Fighting Units. Currently, fighting is still continuing, and the Royal Army occupies many important military strongholds within the assembly area of the Lao Fighting Units, seriously violating the Geneva Accords.

Souphanouvong further wrote that the Geneva Accords confirmed that the Lao Royal Government must take measures to ensure that all citizens, the Lao Fighting Units, and former resistance members could participate in the general election. However, the Royal Government has deliberately excluded the Lao Fighting Units and former resistance members from the general election and recently openly declared that it does not recognize the necessary conditions for ensuring the participation of the Lao Fighting Units in the general election.

The letter continued, stating that the Lao Royal Government bears full responsibility for the aforementioned violations of the Geneva Accords, which seriously threaten the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Laos and further exacerbate the situation in Indochina.

Souphanouvong emphasized, "On behalf of the Lao Fighting Units, I am writing this letter to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference to state our position and request the two chairmen to intervene."

"1. The Lao Fighting Units have been and will thoroughly and strictly implement the Geneva Accords in Laos."

"The Lao Fighting Units firmly demand that all parties concerned must thoroughly and strictly implement the Geneva Accords in Laos."

"2. The Lao Royal Government must cease all military actions and stop the attacks on the Lao Fighting Units in Phongsaly and Sam Neua provinces."

"3. The Lao Fighting Units must be allowed to participate in free nationwide general elections, and in accordance with Article 3 of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference, every citizen, including the Lao Fighting Units and former resistance members, must be able to enjoy rights in the common life of the nation."

"4. The Lao Fighting Units believe that the Lao Royal Government and the French government must bear the responsibilities they have in implementing the Geneva Accords regarding the cessation of hostilities and the resolution of the political problems of Laos."

Souphanouvong concluded by saying that the Lao Fighting Units requested the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference to take all necessary measures to ensure that the clauses of the Geneva Accords concerning Laos are observed, that all military actions provoked by the Lao Royal Government are stopped, and that the consultative conference between the Royal Government and the Lao side should resolve the issue of free general elections throughout Laos, enabling the Lao Fighting Units to participate in the general election.

　　苏发努冯写信给日内瓦会议两位主席
　　要求采取措施使日内瓦协议在老挝得到遵守
    新华社河内十八日电　十一月十日，寮国战斗部队代表苏发努冯亲王写信给日内瓦会议两位主席艾登和莫洛托夫，说明目前威胁着日内瓦协议在老挝的履行的严重情况，并且说明寮国战斗部队对这种严重情况的立场。
    苏发努冯在信中引述了日内瓦协议的有关条款指出，丰沙里和桑怒两省是寮国战斗部队的集结区，属于寮国战斗部队控制，直到双方实现了政治解决。
    信中说，一九五四年八月六日停火前，法兰西联邦部队和王国军队已完全撤出丰沙里，桑怒两省。但不久以后，它们利用停火调动军队，空投和侵入两省，接连不断地向寮国战斗部队进攻。一九五五年三月九日的停止敌对行动协议没有得到王国政府方面的尊重和执行。一九五五年十月十一日在仰光签订的停止敌对行动协议再次规定双方必须在一九五五年十月二十一日在两省内停止敌对行动。但是，王国政府方面不仅不停止敌对行动，而且还继续把新的军队调动到丰沙里和桑怒两省，向寮国战斗部队大力进攻。目前战斗还在继续着，王国军队占领着寮国战斗部队集结区内的许多重要军事据点，严重违反了日内瓦协议。
    苏发努冯又写道，日内瓦协议确认老挝王国政府必须采取措施保证全体公民、寮国战斗部队和前抗战人员都能参加普选。但是，王国政府已故意把寮国战斗部队和前抗战人员摈弃于普选之外，并且在最近公然宣布不承认保证寮国战斗部队能参加普选的必要条件。
    信中接着说，上述的违反日内瓦协议的行动都要由老挝王国政府负完全责任，它使得日内瓦协议在老挝的履行受到严重的威胁，同时它使得印度支那局势更加紧张。
    苏发努冯强调说，我代表寮国战斗部队向日内瓦会议两位主席写这封信申述我们的立场，并且要求两位主席加以干涉。
    一、寮国战斗部队已经并将彻底和严格地在老挝履行日内瓦协议。
    寮国战斗部队坚决要求有关各方必须彻底和严格地在老挝履行日内瓦协议。
    二、老挝王国政府必须停止一切军事行动，制止对丰沙里和桑怒两省的寮国战斗部队的进攻。
    三、必须让寮国战斗部队参加全国范围内的自由普选，必须按照日内瓦会议最后宣言第三条的规定，使每一个公民，其中包括寮国战斗部队和前抗战人员在内，能够享有在国家共同生活中的权利。
    四、寮国战斗部队认为老挝王国政府和法国政府必须承担自己在履行日内瓦协议中有关停止敌对行动和解决老挝政治问题所负的责任。
    苏发努冯最后说，寮国战斗部队要求日内瓦会议两位主席采取一切必要措施使日内瓦协议中有关老挝的条款得到遵守，由老挝王国政府挑起的一切军事行动得到停止，王国政府和寮国方面之间的协商会议应该解决老挝全国的自由普选的问题，使寮国战斗部队能够参加普选。
