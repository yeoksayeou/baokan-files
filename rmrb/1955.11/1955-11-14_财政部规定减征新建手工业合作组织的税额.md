Xinhua News Agency, 13th: The Ministry of Finance announced on the 1st the "Provisional Measures for Handicraft Cooperative Organizations to Pay Industrial and Commercial Tax." These provisional measures stipulate preferential tax reductions for newly organized handicraft production cooperatives to alleviate the difficulties they encounter when they are first organized and to promote the development of handicraft cooperative undertakings. According to the provisions of these provisional measures, newly established handicraft production cooperatives will have their business tax reduced by half for one year and their income tax reduced by half for two years, starting from the month they begin production. If individual handicraft production cooperatives still have operational difficulties in the second year, they may, with the approval of the municipal or county People's Committee, be granted a tax reduction within the scope of 20% of the business tax payable for a certain period.

Handicraft Cooperative Federations, Handicraft Supply and Marketing Production Cooperatives, Handicraft Supply and Marketing Production Groups, and Handicraft Production Groups will have their business tax reduced by 20% in the first year and their income tax reduced by half, starting from the month they begin operations (business).

Some handicraft production cooperatives or handicraft production groups with a large number of people, low output value, and operational difficulties, if in the first year after being newly formed, the monthly business income or profit, calculated on an average per member of the cooperative (group), is less than the starting point for levying industrial and commercial tax on local private small-scale industrial and commercial households, the state will exempt them from all business tax for that month. Months that have reached the starting point will still be subject to a 50% reduction.

The provisional measures stipulate that the People's Committees of provinces and autonomous regions may, based on specific circumstances, grant newly established handicraft cooperative organizations in remote mountainous areas and minority nationality areas a higher standard of tax reduction preferences.

The provisional measures also stipulate the taxation methods for handicraft cooperative organizations during the preferential period and after the preferential treatment is cancelled.

　　财政部规定减征新建手工业合作组织的税额
    新华社十三日讯财政部一日公布了“手工业合作组织交纳工商业税暂行办法”。这个暂行办法规定，对新组织起来的各种手工业生产合作组织以减税优待，以减少他们刚组织起来时所遇到的困难，促进手工业合作事业的发展。按照这个暂行办法的规定，新成立的手工业生产合作社，从开工生产的月份算起，一年内营业税减征一半，两年内所得税也减征一半。个别手工业生产合作社若在第二年经营上仍有困难，经市、县人民委员会批准以后，在应纳营业税税额的百分之二十的范围以内仍酌情给予一定期间的减税优待。
    手工业生产合作社联合社、手工业供销生产社、手工业供销生产小组、手工业生产小组，从开工（开业）的月份起，第一年营业税减征百分之二十，所得税减半交纳。
    某些人数多、产值低和经营有困难的手工业生产合作社或手工业生产小组，在新组成的第一年内，如果那一个月的营业收入额或者收益额，以每个社（组）员平均计算，不满当地私营小型工商业户交纳工商业税起征点，国家就全部免征那个月份的营业税。已满起征点的月份，仍减半征收。
    暂行办法规定，省、自治区人民委员会可根据具体情况，对边远山区和少数民族地区新建立的手工业合作组织以标准较高的减税优待。
    暂行办法对优待期间和优待取消以后，手工业合作组织的纳税办法也作了规定。
