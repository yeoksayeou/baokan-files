Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, 13th: TASS reports: The Foreign Ministers of France, Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States held their twelfth meeting on November 12th, continuing discussions on the second item on the agenda – the issue of disarmament. The meeting was chaired by Dulles.

Dulles expressed several opinions on the outcome of the discussion on the second item on the agenda. He said that, in his view, the discussions held by the ministers were beneficial. He was reluctant to be so optimistic as to say that one side had influenced the other's views, but it seemed to him that the fact that the foreign ministers had presented their views and defended them provided a basis for strengthening mutual understanding.

Dulles said that the difference between the Soviet position and the positions of the three Western countries was this: the three Western countries particularly emphasized inspection and supervision, while the Soviet delegation believed that this emphasis on inspection and supervision, if not for some ulterior motive, indicated that the Western countries regarded this inspection itself as an end, unrelated to genuine arms reduction.

Dulles emphasized that the Western countries advocated seeking reliable methods of inspection and supervision.

Dulles expressed his belief that the exchange of views at the meeting was constructive and would help the four countries' representatives in the UN Disarmament Subcommittee to carry out their work, although the four countries had not yet reached a formal agreement to a great extent. He believed that the foreign ministers must begin working on the issue of the degree of agreement they want to reflect in the communique.

Molotov then spoke.

Molotov pointed out that the disarmament issue is of particularly great significance. When discussing this issue, we believe it is necessary to continue seeking agreement on a broad disarmament plan.

Molotov said that the Soviet Union first views the solution of the disarmament issue from the standpoint of halting the arms race. We agree with Mr. Dulles's opinion: in discussing this issue at this meeting, we strive to clearly explain our views and achieve mutual understanding. We believe that, in this regard, beneficial results will be obtained from our discussions that have already taken place. We believe that, on some issues, our attitudes are approaching each other. We will also not conceal that, on some issues, we have not yet reached an agreement. If we cannot bring our views closer on the main issue of halting the arms race, then this will make it difficult to reach agreements on individual details of this entire issue.

Molotov said: The issue of supervision is of great significance in this regard. Disarmament should be coordinated with the establishment of effective international supervision. However, if we put aside the solution of the issue of halting the arms race, or put it off into the distant future, and only study the details of the issue of supervision, this is not in line with the basic goal and desire of halting the arms race, eliminating the threat of war, and reducing the burden of armaments.

Molotov pointed out: Now, the primary issue in disarmament may be the issue of prohibiting atomic weapons. Considering the difficulty of solving this problem, the Soviet government, in its May 10 proposal, put forward an opinion that makes it possible for us to solve this problem gradually and in stages. In the first stage, while implementing the planned measures to reduce armed forces and armaments, monitoring posts can be set up at airports, railway hubs, and major ports to prevent surprise attacks. Molotov said: We note with satisfaction that the recent reactions of the United States, France, and Britain to the proposal to establish monitoring posts are, in general, good. However, it must be noted that this is only a component part of the disarmament plan. Similarly, we believe that we have a responsibility to point out that, under certain conditions, the Soviet government will also actively consider the US proposal on aerial photography and the exchange of military intelligence in the corresponding stages of completing the disarmament task. Molotov expressed his belief that the efforts made by various countries to solve the issue of supervising the prohibition of atomic weapons and disarmament will produce positive results.

Molotov pointed out that, precisely because there are still certain difficulties in the technical issues of supervising the prohibition of atomic weapons, we should now take measures to ease the threat of atomic war, so that we can all feel at ease as we wish. The Soviet government attaches great importance to the decision on morally condemning atomic weapons, which the United Nations can make in order to prevent the occurrence of atomic war. The Soviet Union believes that if the governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France declare that they will undertake the obligation not to be the first to use atomic and hydrogen weapons, and appeal to other countries to do so, then the significance of this moral obligation will not be less than the significance of the international agreement against bacteriological and chemical weapons adopted in 1925, and may even be more important than in the past.

Molotov finally said: In our communique on the results of the discussion, it should be pointed out in which aspects we have reached an agreement, which aspects still need further study, and our further joint efforts.

Dulles said after Molotov's speech that he would like to express one more opinion. He said that when talking about mobilizing world public opinion against atomic war, they should not imply that other forms of war are acceptable. He also said that much of what Molotov said was very beneficial and appropriate for the discussion, and would help them to draft a communique on this issue.

Molotov said when expressing his opinion on Dulles's opinion: Of course, I fully agree with Dulles that we must consider not only preventing atomic war, but also preventing general war. That is why we believe that the central issue is to stop the arms race. Molotov said, in my opinion, if we unanimously stated that the four major powers, in accordance with the statements of their heads of government, will not use force against each other, and will strive to resolve existing or possible differences between them in a peaceful manner, then this would be a very good thing. He said, I think that, from the perspective of maintaining and strengthening world peace, such an agreement on this issue would be very useful.

Macmillan then spoke. He said that, considering Molotov's speech, he believed that the discussion seemed to be ending in a good atmosphere. It is very clear that agreement has been reached on some issues. He said that he was deeply impressed by Molotov's repeated warnings about the threat of the arms race, which weighed heavily on the people and deepened the threat of war. He believed that Molotov made a very wise suggestion when he said that they should focus on pointing out the issues on which they had reached an agreement and not conceal the issues on which they had still not reached an agreement. In general, they have reached a consensus on their goals, but have not reached complete agreement on how to achieve these goals.

Macmillan finally said that he agreed with Molotov's view that the debate was beneficial and would also be conducive to the work of the UN Disarmament Subcommittee, which is tasked with continuing to discuss the issue of disarmament in detail.

The meeting then ended. Dulles, who chaired the meeting, said that the next meeting would be held on the afternoon of November 14th. The ministers will continue to discuss the third item on the agenda – the issue of developing contacts between East and West.

    四国外长十二日继续讨论裁军问题
    莫洛托夫申述苏联对裁军的意见
    新华社十三日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦讯：法国、英国、苏联和美国的外交部长们十一月十二日举行第十二次会议，继续讨论第二项议程——裁军问题。会议由杜勒斯担任主席。
    杜勒斯就第二项议程讨论的结果发表了几点意见。他说，在他看来，部长们举行的讨论是有益的。他不愿抱这样乐观的态度，来说某一方已经影响了对方的看法，但是在他看来，外交部长们已经提出了他们的观点并且为这些观点进行了辩护这一事实就为加强相互谅解提供了基础。
    杜勒斯说，苏联的立场和西方三国的立场之间的分歧是这样的：西方三国特别强调视察和监督，苏联代表团则认为，这种对视察和监督的强调如果不是具有某种不可告人的目的，就是说明西方国家认为这种视察本身就是一个目的，同真正的裁减军备没有联系。
    杜勒斯强调，西方国家主张寻求视察和监督的可靠方法。
    杜勒斯表示，他相信在会议上交换意见是具有建设性意义的，并且将有助于四国代表们在联合国裁军小组委员会进行工作，虽然四国还没有在很大程度上达成正式协议。他认为外交部长们必须就他们要在公报里反映的协议程度的问题开始工作。
    莫洛托夫接着发言。
    莫洛托夫指出，裁军问题是有特别重大的意义的。在讨论这个问题的时候，我们认为有必要在广泛的裁军计划问题上继续谋求达成协议。
    莫洛托夫说，苏联首先从停止扩充军备的观点看待裁军问题的解决。我们同意杜勒斯先生的意见：在这次会议上讨论这个问题时我们力求清楚地说明我们的观点，取得互相谅解。我们认为，在这方面，将从我们所已经进行的讨论中得到有益的成果。我们认为，在某些问题上，我们的态度是互相接近的。我们也不会掩饰，在有些问题上，我们还没有达成一致意见。如果我们不能在停止扩充军备这个主要问题上使我们的观点接近，那末这将使在这整个问题的个别细节方面达成协议遭到困难。
    莫洛托夫说：在这方面监督问题有很重大的意义。裁军应当以建立有效的国际监督来配合。但是，如果我们把停止扩充军备的问题的解决推到一边，或推到遥远的未来，而只研究监督问题的细节，这是不符合停止扩充军备、消除战争威胁和减轻军备负担这个基本目标和愿望的。
    莫洛托夫指出：现在，裁军问题中首要的问题可能是禁止原子武器问题。考虑到解决这个问题的困难，苏联政府在五月十日的建议中提出了使我们有可能逐步地、分阶段地解决这个问题的意见。在第一阶段，可以在实行拟定的裁减武装部队和军备的措施的同时，在飞机场、铁路枢纽和大港口设立监察所来防止突然袭击。莫洛托夫说：我们满意地指出，美国、法国和英国最近对设立监察所的建议的反应，总的来说，是良好的。不过得要注意，这只是裁军计划的一个组成部分。同样地，我们认为有责任指出，在一定的条件下，苏联政府在完成裁军任务的相应阶段里对美国关于进行空中摄影和交换军事情报的建议也会予以积极的考虑。莫洛托夫表示相信，各国为解决对禁止原子武器和裁军实行监督问题而作的努力，会产生积极结果。
    莫洛托夫指出，正是由于对禁止原子武器的监督的技术性问题上现在还有某些困难，我们现在就应当采取措施来缓和原子战争威胁，使我们大家都能够如愿地安心。苏联政府非常重视关于在道义上谴责原子武器的决定，为了防止原子战争发生，联合国是可以作出这个决定的。苏联认为，如果苏联、美国、英国和法国政府声明，它们将承担不首先使用原子武器和氢武器的义务，并且向其他国家这样呼吁，那末这种道义上的义务的意义就不会比一九二五年所通过的反对细菌武器和化学武器的国际协定的意义小，甚至会比过去更有份量。
    莫洛托夫最后说：在我们的关于讨论结果的公报中应当指出，哪些方面我们已经达成了协议，哪些方面还须要进一步研究和我们进一步共同努力。
    杜勒斯在莫洛托夫发言以后说，他愿意再发表一点意见。他说，在谈到动员世界舆论反对原子战争的时候，他们不应当暗示其他方式的战争是可以的。他又说，莫洛托夫所说的许多话对于讨论是非常有益的和恰当的，而且将有助于他们就这个问题拟订一项公报。
    莫洛托夫在就杜勒斯的这个意见发表意见时说：当然，我完全同意杜勒斯的话，就是我们必须考虑不仅防止原子战争，而且要考虑防止一般的战争。这就是为什么我们认为中心问题是停止军备竞赛的原因。莫洛托夫说，在我看来，假如我们一致表示：四大国根据他们政府首脑的声明，将不在它们之间使用武力，并且将为争取用和平方式解决它们之间现有的或可能发生的分歧而努力，那末，这将是一件很好的事情。他说，我认为，从维护和加强世界和平的观点看来，在这个问题上的这种一致意见将是非常有用处的。
    麦克米伦接着发言。他说，考虑到莫洛托夫的发言，他认为讨论似乎将在良好的气氛中结束。十分明显，已经在一些问题上取得一致意见。他说，莫洛托夫就沉重地压在人民身上并且加深了战争威胁的军备竞赛的威胁一再提出的警告给他留下很深的印象。他认为，莫洛托夫说他们应当着重指出他们已经取得一致意见的问题而不必隐讳仍然没有取得一致意见的问题的时候，他是提出了一个非常明智的建议。一般地说，他们已经就他们的目的达成一致的看法，但是没有就实现这些目的的方法达成完全一致。
    麦克米伦最后说，他同意莫洛托夫的下述意见：辩论是有益的，而且也将有利于奉命继续详细讨论裁军问题的联合国裁军小组委员会的工作。
    会议至此结束。担任主席的杜勒斯说，下次会议将在十一月十四日下午举行。部长们将继续讨论第三项议程——发展东西方之间的接触问题。
