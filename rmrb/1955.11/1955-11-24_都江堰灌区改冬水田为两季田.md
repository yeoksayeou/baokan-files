　　Dujiangyan Irrigation Area Converts Winter Water Fields to Two-Season Fields
    By the end of October, the Dujiangyan Irrigation Area in the western Sichuan Plain had completed its plan to convert 33,500 mu of winter water fields. Eighty percent of these have already begun to be planted with rapeseed and green manure crops.

    Before liberation, many farmlands in the low-lying areas of the Dujiangyan Irrigation Area gradually turned into swamp fields because farmers could not afford to dig ditches for drainage. After the land reform, the irrigation management work in the Dujiangyan area was gradually improved. After the farmers organized, they changed more than 10,000 mu of winter water fields through measures such as digging ditches, dredging old ditches, and draining water. These fields yielded an additional season of rice. This year, with the rapid development of the cooperative movement in the irrigation area, farmers are more actively demanding to change winter water fields into two-season fields to increase the production of oil crops and grain. Before the autumn harvest, fourteen counties including Guanxian, Wenjiang, and Shuangliu surveyed and counted the local winter water fields, surveyed the depth and flow direction of groundwater, and formulated plans for the whole county to change winter water fields. During the autumn harvest, they mobilized the local farmers and, under the requirement of "harvesting while digging ditches," completed the plan to change 33,500 mu of winter water fields by the end of October.

　　都江堰灌区改冬水田为两季田
    四川省川西平原都江堰灌区到十月底已完成改变冬水田三万三千五百亩的计划。其中百分之八十已开始种植油菜及绿肥作物。
    解放前，都江堰灌区的低洼地区因农民无力开沟排水；很多农田逐渐变成沼泽田。土地改革以后，都江堰灌溉管理工作逐步改进，农民们组织起来后，通过开沟、淘修旧沟、排水等措施，改变了一万亩以上的冬水田，这些田地都多收了一季水稻。今年，随着灌区合作化运动的迅速发展，农民们更积极要求改变冬水田为两季田来增产油料和粮食。灌县、温江、双流等十四个县，在秋收前调查和统计了当地的冬水田，勘测了地下水深、流向等，分别制定了全县改变冬水田的计划，在秋收时，发动了当地农民，在“边收割、边开沟”的要求下，到十月底即已完成了改变冬水田三万三千五百亩的计划。
