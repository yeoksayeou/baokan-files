Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi Dispatch: Lao News: According to the provisions of the agreement signed in Rangoon by the delegation of the Lao Kingdom Government and the delegation of the Lao Fighting Forces, the Lao Joint Military Commission, composed of representatives from both the Lao Kingdom Government and the Lao Fighting Forces, officially held a meeting in Vientiane on the morning of October 29. At this meeting, the representatives of both sides introduced themselves to each other and accepted the negotiation records transferred by the former Military Conference.

According to a broadcast by the Saigon Phaya Radio on the 4th, the Lao Kingdom Government, using the Lao Fighting Forces' "attack" on Na King in Sam Neua province as a pretext, has unilaterally announced the "temporary suspension" of the Lao Joint Military Commission meetings. The work of the Joint Military Commission, which had just begun according to the Rangoon Agreement, has been brought to a standstill again.

News from Laos states that Na King was originally a place where the Lao Fighting Forces were concentrated. After the ceasefire agreement reached by both sides in Rangoon came into effect, the Lao Kingdom's army continued to attack Na King and other assembly points of the Lao Fighting Forces. The political delegation of the Lao Fighting Forces has written to the Lao International Commission, requesting it to urge the Kingdom Government to strictly implement the ceasefire agreement.

    老挝双方联合军事委员会会议
    因老挝王国方面阻挠而停止工作
    据新华社河内电  老挝消息：根据老挝王国政府代表团和寮国战斗部队代表团在仰光签订的协议的规定，老挝王国政府和寮国战斗部队双方代表组成的老挝联合军事委员会，十月二十九日上午在万象正式举行会议。在这次会议上，双方代表互相作了介绍，并且接受了前军事会议移交的谈判记录。
    据西贡法亚电台四日广播，老挝王国政府以寮国战斗部队“进攻”桑怒省的那经为借口，已经片面宣布“暂时停止”举行老挝双方的联合军事委员会会议。根据仰光协议刚刚开始的联合军事委员会的工作又陷于停顿。
    从老挝来的消息说：那经本来就是寮国战斗部队集结的地方。老挝双方在仰光达成的停止敌对行动协议生效后，老挝王国军队仍然不断向寮国战斗部队的那经和其他一些集结地点进攻。寮国战斗部队政治代表团为此曾经写信给老挝国际委员会，要求它促使王国政府严格执行停止敌对行动协议。
