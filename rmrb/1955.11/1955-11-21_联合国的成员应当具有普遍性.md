UN Membership Should Be Universal

Recently, an increasing number of countries have demanded an end to the abnormal phenomenon of excluding many nations from the United Nations Organization. To break the deadlock created by the United States regarding the admission of new members to the UN, many countries have made great efforts. A few days ago, twenty-five countries, including Canada, submitted a joint proposal to the UN General Assembly, suggesting that the Assembly urge the Security Council
  "to consider all pending applications for membership from countries that do not have any problems with unification, in accordance with the general opinion that the UN should admit members as broadly as possible," so as to open the door of the UN to the eighteen applicant countries. The twenty-five-nation proposal reflects the common aspiration of the vast majority of countries and should be valued by all UN member states.

    The United Nations is an international organization for maintaining peace. According to the provisions of the UN Charter, all peace-loving countries that accept the obligations contained in the Charter and are indeed able and willing to fulfill those obligations should be admitted as members of the United Nations. At the same time, it is clear that only when the membership of the United Nations is broadly universal can this international organization better play its role in maintaining international peace and promoting international cooperation. In any case, the United Nations should not exclude countries from participating in this international organization because of differences in their economic, political, and social systems. Especially in recent years, the universality of UN membership has become a common call from many countries. The final communique of the Asian-African Conference pointed out: "For effective cooperation in promoting world peace, UN membership should be universal." At the tenth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations and at this session of the UN General Assembly, representatives of many countries have advocated accepting all applicant countries into the UN without discrimination. This universal aspiration is clearly not to be ignored.

    Everyone knows that many countries in Europe, Asia, and Africa remain outside the United Nations Organization to this day entirely because of the long-term obstruction by the United States. The United States groundlessly opposes the participation of democratic countries such as Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, Albania, and the Mongolian People's Republic in the United Nations Organization. The Soviet Union's proposal to simultaneously admit all applicant countries to the United Nations has been repeatedly vetoed under the obstruction of the United States. The position of the United States is: the United States will prevent any country whose policies do not conform to the tastes of the U.S. ruling clique from entering the United Nations. This practice of the United States, which controls the gate of the United Nations and attempts to turn the United Nations into an organization controlled by certain groups of countries, has aroused increasing dissatisfaction and opposition from more and more countries. International public opinion strongly demands that the United States change its unreasonable position, abandon its past manipulation and obstruction tactics on the issue of admitting new members to the United Nations, and allow this long-pending issue to be resolved smoothly.

    However, Lodge, the United States representative to the United Nations, recently issued a statement indicating that the United States still does not intend to support the admission of all eighteen applicant countries to the United Nations. In addition to continuing to slander the various people's democratic countries, Lodge and the American propaganda machine have particularly and wantonly vilified the Mongolian People's Republic. This shows that even now, there are still people in the U.S. ruling clique who are unwilling to face reality. As everyone knows, the government of the Mongolian People's Republic enjoys the full support of the people. Countries with a population of nine hundred million have established diplomatic relations with it, and their friendly cooperative relations are constantly strengthening. At the same time, the Mongolian People's Republic and democratic countries such as Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Albania are all resolutely pursuing policies of maintaining peace and friendship with all countries, and have made significant efforts to strengthen world peace and promote international cooperation. The United Nations Organization has no reason to continue to keep them outside the door. The United States' attempt to use that stale rhetoric as an excuse to obstruct the participation of the various democratic countries in the United Nations is completely untenable.

    The Chinese people have always maintained that UN membership should be universal. In the Asian-African Conference, the Chinese government supported the resolution on this issue. Now, the proposal of twenty-five countries including Canada, if adopted, will undoubtedly greatly increase the universality of UN membership and improve the situation in which Asian and African countries are not adequately represented in the UN; this is beneficial to the UN's role in maintaining peace. The Chinese people support the proposal of twenty-five countries including Canada.

    The Security Council is preparing to hold a meeting soon to discuss the applications of the new member states. All who cherish the United Nations Organization and value peace hope that the Security Council will consider the wishes of the vast majority of countries and make a wise decision to pave the way for this session of the UN General Assembly to accept all eighteen applicant countries into the United Nations. The smooth resolution of the issue of admitting new member states will not only strengthen the role and prestige of the United Nations Organization but also help strengthen mutual trust and cooperation among nations.

### 联合国的成员应当具有普遍性

　　联合国的成员应当具有普遍性
  最近以来，愈来愈多的国家要求终止把许多国家排斥在联合国组织之外的不正常现象。为了打开在联合国接纳新会员国问题上美国所造成的僵局，许多国家进行了很大的努力。前几天，加拿大等二十五个国家向联合国大会提出了一项联合提案，建议大会促使安全理事会
  “按照赞成联合国尽可能广泛地接纳会员国的普遍意见来考虑所有那些统一不发生问题的国家的悬而未决的要求加入联合国的申请”，以便能够为十八个申请国打开联合国的大门。二十五国的提案反映了绝大多数国家的共同愿望，应当受到联合国全体会员国的重视。
    联合国是一个维护和平的国际组织。根据联合国宪章的规定，凡是一切爱好和平的国家，接受宪章所载的义务而且确能并愿意履行该项义务的，就应当被接纳为联合国的会员国。同时，很明显，只有联合国的成员具有广泛的普遍性，这个国际机构才能够更好地发挥维持国际和平和促进国际合作的作用。不管从那方面来说，联合国都不应该因为某些国家的经济、政治和社会制度不同而排斥它们参加这个国际组织。特别是近年来，联合国会员应当具有普遍性已成为许多国家的共同呼声。亚非会议最后公报就曾经指出：“为了进行有效的合作以促进世界和平起见，联合国的成员应当具有普遍性。”在联合国成立十周年纪念会和本届联合国大会上，许多国家的代表都主张无歧视地接受所有申请国家参加联合国。这种普遍的愿望显然是不容忽视的。
    谁都知道，欧洲、亚洲和非洲的许多国家至今仍然留在联合国组织之外，完全是由于美国长期从中阻挠的缘故。美国毫无道理的反对罗马尼亚、匈牙利、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚和蒙古人民共和国等民主国家参加联合国组织。苏联提出的同时接纳所有申请国参加联合国的建议，在美国的阻挠下一再遭到否决。美国的立场就是：凡是那些国家奉行的政策不符合美国统治集团胃口的，美国就阻止它们进入联合国。美国这种把持着联合国大门、企图把联合国变为受某些国家集团所控制的组织的做法，已引起了愈来愈多的国家的不满和反对。各国舆论强烈要求美国改变它的无理立场，在联合国接纳新会员国的问题上放弃过去那套操纵和阻挠的手法，使这一久悬未决的问题得以顺利解决。
    但是，美国出席联合国的代表洛奇最近发表声明，表示美国仍然不打算支持接纳全部十八个申请国参加联合国。洛奇和美国的宣传机构除了继续对各人民民主国家加以诽谤以外，特别对蒙古人民共和国肆意进行诬蔑。这表明直到现在为止，美国统治集团中还有人不肯正视现实。大家知道，蒙古人民共和国的政府受到人民充分的支持。现在已有九亿人口的国家同它建立了外交关系，而且它们之间的友好合作关系不断在加强。同时，蒙古人民共和国和罗马尼亚、匈牙利、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚等民主国家，都同样地坚决奉行维护和平和对各国友好的政策，对于加强世界和平和促进国际合作的事业作了重大的努力。联合国组织没有任何理由继续把它们摒拒在大门之外。美国想用那种陈腐的论调来作为阻挠各民主国家参加联合国的借口，是完全站不住脚的。
    中国人民一向主张联合国的成员应当具有普遍性，在亚非会议中中国政府支持了有关这一问题的决议。现在，加拿大等二十五国的提案，如获通过，无疑将大大提高联合国成员的普遍性，改善亚非国家在联合国中得不到适当代表性的现状；这对于联合国发挥其维护和平事业的作用是有利的。中国人民支持加拿大等二十五国提案。
    安全理事会已准备最近举行会议讨论各新会员国的申请。一切爱护联合国组织和珍惜和平的人，都希望安理会考虑到绝大多数国家的愿望，作出明智的决定，为本届联合国大会接受全部十八个申请国参加联合国铺平道路。接纳新会员国问题的顺利解决，不仅将能够加强联合国组织的作用和威信，而且会有助于加强国际间的互信和合作。
