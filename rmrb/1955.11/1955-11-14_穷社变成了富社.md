　　Poor Cooperative Becomes Rich Cooperative
　　Teng Minli　Zhang Yusheng
　　In the autumn of 1954, before planting, Wu Song Township in Wuxian County, Jiangsu Province, established eleven agricultural production cooperatives. The two mutual aid teams led by poor peasants Zhu Sanduo and Zhu Quansheng were also brewing the idea of forming a cooperative. The thirteen households in the two teams were all poor peasants with very few cattle and farm tools. So they invited four nearby middle-peasant households and seven poor-peasant households to form a cooperative together. Everyone concentrated their seeds and fertilizers to prepare for autumn planting and discussed the specific issues of establishing the cooperative. However, as the cooperative was about to be completed, the four middle-peasant households changed their minds. They saw that the cooperative lacked cattle and farm tools, the poor peasants had a difficult life, and the land was poor (five or six mu of land yielded nothing last year due to floods). Fearing they would suffer losses, they all withdrew, taking away four cattle and four boats. Five poor-peasant households, seeing the middle peasants withdraw, also wavered and demanded to withdraw, taking away one cow and two boats. As a result, only fifteen poor-peasant households remained in the cooperative, with only three cattle and five small boats. But they did not bow to difficulties. Everyone resolutely demanded to run the cooperative. They believed that under the leadership of the Communist Party, relying on their own labor, they could definitely run the cooperative well. They also believed that the government would support poor peasants in running cooperatives. The Minsheng Agricultural Production Cooperative was thus established. After the cooperative was established, the villagers called them the "poor cooperative." Teng Minli and Zhang Yusheng both believed that without enough cattle and farm tools, the cooperative would be difficult to run well. The district and township cadres were also very worried. The township cooperative director personally went to the cooperative to help them solve problems, and the government also provided loans to support them. After a year of hard work, this "poor cooperative" was not only consolidated but also achieved a bumper harvest.

　　The Minsheng Agricultural Production Cooperative did encounter many difficulties in the production process. The cooperative had 177 mu of land but only two old cattle and one yellow cattle, and waterwheels were also insufficient. Before spring plowing this year, in order to accumulate funds to exchange for good cattle and add waterwheels, everyone decided to eat porridge for two months, saving rice to invest in the cooperative as production funds. The cooperative saved nine shi of rice in two months and borrowed 624 yuan from the government, sold the old cattle and exchanged them for two big cattle, and bought a strong cattle and two windmills. When plowing and watering, the cooperative members also implemented a method of alternating people and cattle, going out early and returning late, to overcome the difficulty of insufficient cattle power. The cooperative did not have funds to buy fertilizer, so the members decided to accumulate fertilizer themselves. There were not enough boats for dredging mud, so they worked in shifts day and night, resting people but not boats. As a result, each mu of land was applied with 130 dan of river mud, 10 dan of grass mud, as well as yellow manure and ash manure, which was more than 20 dan of fertilizer per mu than the surrounding individual farmers.

　　They also actively improved production techniques, implemented salt water seed selection, and sowed using the "sparse seedling" method. The seedlings cultivated in the cooperative were particularly strong, and farmers outside the cooperative were surprised and said: Our seedlings fall in the field, but the seedlings of the "poor cooperative" do not fall. The cooperative members also attached great importance to rice borer control. Starting from the seedling fields, they constantly set up lights to lure moths, collect eggs, and cut off dead heart seedlings, ensuring that all the rice fields had no white ears, which was never possible when working individually.

　　Due to the active labor of all the cooperative members, an unprecedented harvest was achieved this year. The average yield of rice per mu in the cooperative was 510 jin; the middle peasants who had originally withdrawn only harvested 480 jin per mu; and the poor peasants only harvested 400 jin. The cooperative planted 60 mu of "Huanggu Zao Shiri" superior seeds, which yielded 120 jin more rice per mu than the previously planted "Yisi Xin" variety; and converted 25 mu of early indica rice to late rice, which yielded 150 jin more per mu. The cooperative used all natural fertilizers, and the production cost was very low, with an average cost of only 4.3 yuan per mu; the average farmer outside the cooperative needed more than 7 yuan per mu. High yield and low cost, the net income of cooperative members generally increased. The average net income per household in the cooperative increased by 40% compared with before the establishment of the cooperative. The household with the highest increase increased by more than 500 yuan compared with before joining the cooperative, the general household increased by more than 300 yuan, and the household with the least increase also increased by 43 yuan. Zhu Xingshan's family of eight received 9,531 jin of grain, and their income increased by 450 yuan compared with before joining the cooperative. This "poor cooperative" has indeed become a rich cooperative. In the past, all fifteen poor-peasant households in the cooperative had to reduce or exempt public grain every year. Even in the prosperous year of 1953, there were still twelve households that could not afford to pay public grain. This year, only one household in the cooperative needs to reduce or exempt public grain. Cooperative member Zhou Yulong, although he was allocated land during the land reform, did not have cattle and farm tools, so he could not cultivate the land well, and each mu could only harvest more than 300 jin of grain. Every year, his food ration was not enough, and he could not afford to pay public grain. This year, he received 2,283 jin of rice in the cooperative. After paying the public grain and selling the surplus grain, each member of his family still had more than 600 jin of food ration. He said: "This year is the first year I have paid public grain since liberation. Participating in the cooperative has turned grain-deficient households into surplus-grain households, which is good for myself and for the country."

　　The example of the Minsheng Agricultural Production Cooperative has encouraged the enthusiasm of farmers in the whole township to run cooperatives and has broken the idea of some middle peasants looking down on poor peasants. The four middle-peasant households and five poor-peasant households who had originally withdrawn regretted that they should not have withdrawn. When the cooperative expanded after autumn, they all returned to the cooperative. Now the cooperative has expanded to 31 households, and no one calls them the "poor cooperative" anymore.

　　穷社变成了富社
　　滕民力　章玉勝
    江苏省吴县吴淞乡在一九五四年秋种前建立了十一个农业生产合作社，贫农朱三多和朱泉生领导的两个互助组也酝酿着要办社。两个组十三户都是贫农，耕牛农具都很少，于是又约了附近的四户中农和七户贫农一道建一个社。大家一面把种籽、肥料集中在一起准备秋种；一面讨论建社的具体问题。可是当社快要建成的时候，四户中农变卦了，他们看到社里耕牛农具不足，贫农生活困难，土地又不好（去年受水灾有五、六亩田颗粒未收），怕自己会吃亏，就全部退出去了，带走了四头耕牛、四只船。有五户贫农看到中农退出，自己也动摇起来，要求退社，又带走了一头牛和两只船。这样一来，全社剩下了十五户贫农，只有三头耕牛和五只小船。但是他们没有向困难低头，大家都坚决要求办社。他们相信：在共产党的领导下，依靠自己的劳动，一定能把社办好。他们也相信：政府一定会支持贫农办社的。民生农业生产合作社就这样办起来了。社建成后，村里的农民称他们为“穷社”，滕民力　章玉胜都认为他们没有耕牛农具社难办好；区乡干部也非常耽心。乡合作主任亲自到社里去帮助他们解决问题，政府也贷款支持他们。经过一年的努力，这个
  “穷社”不但巩固了，而且获得了丰收。
    民生农业生产合作社在生产过程中，确实遇到过不少困难。全社一百七十七亩田，只有两头老牛、一头黄牛，水车也不够用。今年春耕前，他们为了积累资金调换好牛、添置水车，大家决定吃两个月粥，省出大米投给社里作生产资金。全社两个月节约了九石大米，又从政府借到六百二十四元的贷款，把老牛卖了换回两头大牛，又买了一头壮牛和两部风车。耕田车水时，社员们还实行了人牛轮替、早出晚归的办法，克服了牛力不足的困难。合作社没有资金买肥料，社员们决定自己积肥，罱泥的船不够，他们就日夜轮班，歇人不歇船。结果每亩田施到一百三十担河泥、十担草泥，还有黄粪和灰粪，比周围单干农民每亩多施二十多担肥。
    他们还积极改进了生产技术，实行了盐水选种，用“落谷稀”的方法播种。社里培育的秧苗特别壮，社外农民都惊奇地说：我们的秧倒在田里，“穷社”的秧反而不倒。社员们对治螟工作也很重视，从秧田开始，就不断地点灯诱蛾、采卵、剪枯心苗，做到全部稻田没有一根白穗，这是单干时从来也办不到的事。
    由于全体社员的积极劳动，今年获得了空前的丰收。全社水稻平均每亩收五百一十斤；原来退出去的中农每亩只收四百八十斤；贫农只收到四百斤。全社种了六十亩“黄谷早十日”优良种，每亩比过去种的“一四新”品种多收一百二十斤稻；把二十五亩早籼稻改种了晚稻，每亩又多收一百五十斤。社里全部用的是自然肥料，生产成本很低，每亩平均成本费只有四元三角；社外一般农民每亩要七元多。产量高、成本低，社员的纯收入普遍增加。全社平均每户的纯收入比建社前增加了百分之四十，最多的户比入社前增加五百多元，一般的户增加三百多元，最少的一户也增加了四十三元。社员朱兴山全家八口，分到九千五百三十一斤粮食，收入比入社前增加四百五十元。这个“穷社”的确变成了富社，全社十五户贫农，过去年年要减免公粮，就在一九五三年丰收的年景，还有十二户缴不起公粮，今年全社只有一户要减免公粮。社员周玉龙，虽然土地改革的时候分得了土地，但是没有耕牛农具，有田种不熟，每亩只能收三百多斤粮食，每年口粮不够，公粮缴不起。今年在社里分到二千二百八十三斤稻谷，缴了公粮，卖了余粮，全家每人还留有六百多斤口粮。他说：“今年是我解放后第一年缴公粮，参加合作社，缺粮户变成了余粮户，自己好，对国家也好。”
    民生农业生产合作社的榜样，鼓舞了全乡农民办社的积极性，打破了一些中农轻视贫农的思想。原来退出去的四户中农和五户贫农都懊悔不该退社，秋后扩社时他们又都回到社里来了。现在全社已扩大到三十一户，再没有人叫他们“穷社”了。
