Rural Party Organization Work Should Center on Cooperation

    A vigorous upsurge of the agricultural cooperation movement has arrived in rural areas across the country. The central link in doing a good job in the agricultural cooperation movement is that the Party's leadership must catch up. The Party's leading organs must have a proactive, active, and all-out spirit to tightly grasp the leadership of the entire movement in their own hands. This requires that the work of rural Party organizations be clearly centered on cooperation.

    In the past few years, some local Party organizations have attached importance to the leadership of agricultural cooperation. They have gradually shifted their leadership focus to agricultural production centered on the development of mutual aid and cooperation, and have truly achieved "the secretary takes action, and the whole party runs the cooperative." Therefore, the development of the agricultural cooperation movement in these places has been rapid and healthy. However, there are not many such places. Quite a few local Party organizations only verbally acknowledge that the leadership center should be shifted to agricultural cooperation, but in fact, they make very little effort, and some even just shout empty slogans like "the secretary takes action, and the whole party runs the cooperative." Of course, after the report by Comrade Mao Zedong "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" was conveyed, especially after the "Resolution on the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" of the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party was published, this situation has changed.

    From the provincial party committees to the village branch committees, except for the Party organizations in industrial cities, enterprises, government agencies, schools, and the army, all should tightly grasp the leadership of the cooperative movement in their own hands, and all should regard leading the agricultural cooperative movement as their main task and agricultural cooperation work as the center of the Party committee's work. In provinces where industry accounts for a large proportion or where there are large-scale capital construction tasks, the provincial party committee must concentrate sufficient strength to lead the cooperative movement well, without relaxing its leadership over industry and while treating industry as a priority. In areas where too many rural cadres were transferred to urban industrial departments in the past, resulting in a weakening of rural leadership, it is now necessary to strengthen rural leadership, such as by transferring provincial-level cadres to work in rural areas on cooperation. At the same time, the provincial party committee should also strengthen the regular inspection of the cooperative movement and guide the movement forward.

    The rural branches are of course the ones that directly run the cooperatives. Relying on the branches to run the cooperatives is what many county and district committees have been uneasy about in the past. They have a strange idea that they themselves cannot run cooperatives, and therefore the branches certainly cannot run cooperatives either. But that is not true. The branches have the confidence to run cooperatives and are able to run cooperatives. This is precisely the case. In Xinyang Prefecture, Henan Province, 3,711 cooperatives were established throughout the prefecture last winter and this spring, of which 1,577 were run by higher-level cadres, 1,573 were run by township branches, and 561 were self-organized by the masses with the assistance of old cooperatives. The vast majority of the cooperatives self-organized by the branches and the masses are good. However, many county and district committees do not see this, and therefore dare not rely on the branches to run cooperatives, and dare not let the branches run cooperatives. This idea must be changed.

    Of course, this does not mean that there are no problems in the work of the current rural Party branches. The organizations of a small number of branches across the country are impure, and some Party members are more seriously eroded and influenced by bourgeois ideology; at the same time, due to the limitations of their ideological understanding, some branches also have problems in mastering policies. However, all of this only shows that the county and district committees should strengthen their specific leadership over the branches. The Party Central Committee has especially pointed out that Party rectification work should be carried out every year in conjunction with the establishment and consolidation of cooperatives; the purpose of Party rectification is to require each branch to truly play a core role in the agricultural cooperation movement.

    In many areas, the Party committee has shifted its leadership focus to agricultural cooperation, and major issues in cooperation have been collectively studied and decided by the Party committee, giving full play to the collective leadership role of the Party committee. However, in many other areas, the prefectural, county, and district committees have not played a collective leadership role in leading the agricultural cooperation movement. According to the principle of the Party's collective leadership, all major issues in cooperation must be collectively discussed and decided by the county committee. Only in this way can the attention of all Party committee members be focused on the issue of agricultural cooperation, so as to ensure the normal development of the agricultural cooperation movement. The Changzhi Prefectural Committee of Shanxi Province and the county committees under its leadership have done a better job. Over the years, the whole region has consistently implemented the policy of "the secretary takes action, and the whole party runs the cooperative." Each member of the prefectural and county committees regularly and directly contacts cooperatives, personally goes deep to create typical examples, and promotes the general; at the same time, the prefectural and county committees also regularly pay attention to the research and discussion of the cooperative situation, and conduct one or two investigations and studies on the changes in rural class relations and the ideological dynamics of the masses every year, and often summarize and exchange experiences through various meetings. It is precisely because the Changzhi Prefectural Committee and the county committees under its leadership have consistently done this over the years that the development of the cooperative movement in the Changzhi area has been rapid and normal. According to the statistics in August 1955, the number of peasant households joining the cooperative in the whole area has reached 63.2 percent of the total number of peasant households, and 98 percent of the cooperatives can increase production.

    In rural areas, a situation centered on agricultural cooperation should be formed, and all other work should revolve around the agricultural cooperation movement. The various departments under the Party committee, such as the organization and propaganda departments, should also regard agricultural cooperation as their own work, and proactively and actively cooperate with this work from their own perspectives. The organization department should combine the rectification and construction of the Party in rural areas with the rectification and construction of cooperatives, and change the current situation of unbalanced distribution of Party members in rural areas, impure organization and impure ideology of some rural branches. The propaganda department should widely, deeply and regularly publicize the Party's agricultural cooperation policies and turn the Party's policies into the actual actions of the masses.

    In order to run agricultural producers' cooperatives in greater numbers and better, Party committees at all levels, especially Party committees above the county level, must strengthen their leadership over various economic departments and other work departments, and give play to the role of various economic departments and cultural and educational, political and legal and other work departments in agricultural cooperation. Mobilize the strength of all aspects of the Party and devote all efforts to carry out the agricultural cooperation movement.

    Secretaries of Party organizations at all levels, especially secretaries of prefectural, county, and district committees, must personally take action to lead the agricultural cooperation movement. In this regard, many places have made achievements, and the Zunhua County Committee of Hebei Province has done a very good job. However, many local Party committee secretaries, on the pretext that they are in charge of overall leadership, have relaxed or even abandoned specific leadership over the agricultural cooperation movement. In fact, except for a few border areas where land reform has not yet been carried out, agricultural cooperation is the most important and most basic work in the overall work of rural areas. If the rural local Party committee secretary does not take care of this work, what work does he take care of? Is there any more important work in rural areas than agricultural cooperation? Is there any work that can be carried out better separately from the cooperative movement? Experience has proved that in areas where the agricultural cooperation movement is doing well, the socialist ideology of the peasants is improving rapidly, and other work in that area is also progressing well. Conversely, in a small number of places where the agricultural cooperation movement has been slow to develop, and capitalist forces still occupy a dominant position in rural areas, other work in these places is also progressing very poorly. To give an example, Xindeng and Tiantai counties in Zhejiang Province are both semi-mountainous areas, the proportion of cash crops is not large, and the natural conditions are similar. However, because the cooperative movement in Xindeng County developed earlier and faster, by the end of July this year, the number of peasants joining the cooperative had reached 63.43 percent of the rural population. Therefore, the county's agricultural production increase, unified purchase and sale of grain, and conscription of soldiers have all taken the lead and become one of the province's advanced counties. On the other hand, because the cooperative movement in Tiantai County developed poorly, with only 6.3 percent of the rural population joining the cooperative, the county has not only reduced production year after year, but also often lags behind in other work. Party committee secretaries, Party leaders, should learn from these educational examples and be able to grasp the central link and promote the overall work from the central link.

    Of course, emphasizing that the Party committee secretary should take action personally does not mean that the secretary should do everything personally, no matter how big or small, but rather that the secretary should always pay attention to grasping and studying the situation of the cooperative movement in his area, and discover and solve problems in a timely manner. To this end, the Party's leading organs and leading personnel must further establish and improve the reporting system, especially to promote a simple and flexible work briefing system that can promptly reflect the situation; according to the needs of the work, various meetings of various natures involving various people should be convened at any time to report on the situation, summarize and arrange work, exchange experiences, or specifically study and solve a major problem. In particular, the leading personnel of the Party committee organs should go deep into the villages and cooperatives, personally guide and help the grass-roots cadres to conscientiously do a good job in a cooperative, thoroughly understand the various issues related to the establishment and consolidation of cooperatives, truly transform themselves from laymen to experts, and create a set of typical experiences to guide the general. Only in this way, by making their leadership close to reality and close to the masses, can the Party committee organs and their leaders often understand the progress of the cooperative movement, so that their leadership can walk ahead of the mass movement and give the movement strong guidance.

    In short, in the new situation of the arrival of the high tide of agricultural cooperation, in order for our Party's organizations in rural areas to make their leadership walk ahead of the mass movement, and not fall behind the movement, they must, in accordance with the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party and the instructions of Comrade Mao Zedong, conscientiously shift the leadership focus to agricultural cooperation, tightly grasp the leadership of the entire movement in the hands of the Party committee, mobilize the strength of the region, and jointly strive to realize the socialist transformation of agriculture.

### 农村党组织的工作要以合作化为中心

    农村党组织的工作要以合作化为中心
    在全国农村中，声势浩大的农业合作化运动的高潮已经到来。搞好农业合作化运动的中心环节是党的领导要赶上去。党的领导机关要有一种主动的、积极的、全力以赴的精神，把整个运动的领导紧紧地掌握到自己的手里。这就要求农村党组织的工作明确地以合作化为中心。
    在过去的几年中间，有的地方的党组织是重视对农业合作化的领导的。它们已经逐步地把自己的领导重心转移到以发展互助合作为中心的农业生产上来，真正做到了“书记动手，全党办社”。因此，这些地方的农业合作化运动的发展是迅速的，健康的。但是这样的地方还不算多。相当多的地方的党组织，只是口头上承认应当把领导中心转到农业合作化方面来，但是在实际上作的努力却很少，有的甚至只是空喊“书记动手，全党办社”。当然，在毛泽东同志的“关于农业合作化问题”的报告传达以后，尤其在党的七届六中全会（扩大）的“关于农业合作化问题的决议”公布以后，这种情况已有改变。
    从省委到乡村的支部委员会，除了工业城市、企业、机关、学校和部队的党组织以外，都应当把合作化运动的领导紧紧地掌握在自己手里，都应当把领导农业合作化运动当做自己的主要任务，把农业合作化工作当做党委工作的中心。在工业比重很大或者基本建设任务很大的省份，省委在不放松对工业的领导、把工业当做重点的情况下，也要集中足够的力量把合作化运动领导好。过去过多地抽调了农村干部到城市工业部门，以致农村领导力量减弱的地区，现在就要充实农村领导力量，例如抽调省一级干部下乡做合作化工作等。同时省委还要加强对合作化运动的经常的检查工作，指导运动前进。
    直接办社的当然是农村支部。依靠支部办社，这是过去不少县委和区委所不放心的。他们有一种奇怪的想法，就是他们自己不会办社，因而支部也一定不会办社。实际上并不是如此。支部有信心办社，也能够办社。事实正是如此，河南信阳专区去冬今春全区办了三千七百一十一个合作社，其中由上级干部办的一千五百七十七个，乡支部办的一千五百七十三个，在老社协助下群众自办的五百六十一个，支部和群众自办的社绝大多数都好。但是不少县、区委就看不到这一点，因而不敢依靠支部办社，不敢让支部办社。这种想法必须改变。
    当然，这并不是说，目前农村党支部的工作中已经没有什么问题。全国还有少数支部的组织不纯，部分党员受资产阶级思想的侵蚀和影响比较严重；同时由于受了思想认识水平的限制，部分支部在掌握政策上也并不是没有问题的。但是，这一切只是说明县、区委应该加强对支部的具体领导。党中央特别指出了每年要结合建社、整社进行整党工作；整党的目的，就是要求每个支部真正能够发挥在农业合作化运动中的核心作用。
    不少地区，党委已经把领导重心转到农业合作化方面来，合作化中的重大问题都经过党委的集体研究和决定，充分发挥了党委的集体领导作用。但是也还有不少地区，地委、县委和区委在领导农业合作化运动的工作中，还没有发挥集体领导作用。按照党的集体领导的原则，合作化中的一切重大问题，都要经过县委会集体讨论，集体决定。只有这样，把全体党委委员的注意力集中到农业合作化问题上来，才能保证农业合作化运动的正常发展。山西长治地委及其领导下的各县县委就做得比较好，几年来全区自始至终实行了“书记动手，全党办社”的方针，地委和县委的每一委员都经常地直接地联系合作社，亲自深入下去创造典型，推动一般；同时地委、县委还经常注意对合作化情况的研究和讨论，每年都要进行一两次关于农村阶级关系的变化和群众思想动态的调查研究，并且经常通过各种会议来总结交流经验。正是由于长治地委及其领导下的各县县委，几年来是一贯地这样作的，所以长治地区合作化运动的发展是迅速的，正常的，据一九五五年八月的统计，全区入社的农户已达到总农户的百分之六十三点二，百分之九十八的合作社都可以增产。
    在农村中应该形成以农业合作化为中心的形势，其他一切工作都应该围绕着农业合作化运动。党委所属的各个部门，即组织、宣传等部门，也应当把农业合作化当做自己本身的工作，主动积极地从自己方面配合这一工作。组织部门要把农村的整党建党同整社建社结合起来，改变目前农村党员分布不平衡、部分农村支部的组织不纯和思想不纯的状况。宣传部门要广泛地深入地并且是经常地宣传党的农业合作化方针政策，把党的方针政策变成群众的实际行动。
    为了把农业生产合作社办得更多更好，各级党委特别是县以上的党委必须加强对各经济部门和其他工作部门的领导，发挥各经济部门和文教、政法等工作部门在农业合作化中的作用。把全党各方面的力量都动员起来，全力开展农业合作化运动。
    地方各级党组织的书记、特别是地委书记、县委书记和区委书记必须亲自动手，领导农业合作化运动。在这方面已经有很多地方做出了成绩，河北遵化县委就做得很好。但是，有许多地方党委书记借口自己是管全盘领导工作的，因而放松甚至放弃了对农业合作化运动的具体领导。事实上，除少数还没有进行土地改革的边疆地区以外，农业合作化工作就是农村的全盘工作中的最主要的工作和最基本的工作，农村地方党委书记不管这个工作，管哪个工作？在农村里难道还有比农业合作化工作更重要的工作吗？难道还有可以离开合作化运动单独进行得更好的工作？经验证明：凡是那个地区的农业合作化运动搞得好，农民的社会主义思想就提高得快，那个地区的其他工作也就进行得好。反之，有少数地方因为农业合作化运动迟迟不能开展，农村的资本主义势力还占居着优势，这些地方的其他工作也进行得很不好。举一个例子：浙江新登和天台两个县都是半山区，经济作物的比重都不大，自然条件差不多。但因新登县的合作化运动发展得较早、较快，截至今年七月底，入社的农民已达到农村人口的百分之六十三点四三，因而这个县的农业增产、粮食统购统销、征集兵员等工作，都走在前面，成为全省先进的县份之一。而天台县则因合作化运动发展较差，入社农民只占农村人口的百分之六点三，因而这个县不但连年减产，而且其他工作也常常落在后头。党委书记，党的领导者，应当从这种富有教育意义的事例中吸取经验教训，要锻炼自己能够善于抓住中心环节，善于从中心环节入手去推动全盘工作。
    当然，强调党委书记亲自动手，并不是说，事无大小都要书记亲自去做，而是说书记应当经常注意掌握和研究自己地区合作化运动的情况，及时发现和解决问题。为此，党的领导机关和领导人员，必须进一步建立和健全汇报制度，特别是要提倡简便灵活的、能够及时反映情况的工作简报制度；必须根据工作的需要，随时召开各种人参加的各种性质的会议，汇报情况，总结布置工作，交流经验，或者是专门研究解决一个重大的问题。特别是党委机关的领导人员应当深入村、社，亲自指导和帮助基层干部切实搞好一个社，把有关建社和整社的各种问题摸深摸透，真正使自己由外行变内行，并且创造出一套典型的经验来指导一般。只有这样使自己的领导接近实际和接近群众，党委机关及其领导人才能经常了解到合作化运动进行的情况，使自己的领导走在群众运动的前面，给予运动以有力的指导。
    总之，在农业合作化的高潮到来的新形势下，我们党在农村的组织为要使自己的领导走在群众运动的前面，而不致落在运动的后面，就必须按照党的七届六中全会的决议和毛泽东同志的指示，切实地把领导重心转向农业合作化，把整个运动的领导紧紧地掌握在党委会的手里，把本地区的力量动员起来，共同为实现农业的社会主义改造而奋斗。
