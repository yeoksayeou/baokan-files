　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd: The National Liaison Council Against Military Bases in Japan held its third national convention in Tokyo on the 22nd.

　　Participating in the conference were representatives of residents from around American military bases in various locations, including Tachikawa, Niigata, Itami, Itazuke, Kisarazu, and Kita-Fuji.

　　The conference discussed the strategy for strengthening the struggle against American military bases. The conference decided to organize prefectural-wide anti-base movements in each prefecture and to petition the government and the American embassy against military bases. The conference also decided to launch signature and fundraising campaigns in each prefecture and to hold widespread lecture meetings, etc., to expand the scale and influence of the anti-base movement.

　　On the same day, a portion of the representatives attending the conference once again petitioned the American embassy. The representatives directly met with American embassy personnel and submitted a letter of request to the American Ambassador to Japan, Allison, demanding that the United States not bring atomic weapons into Japan and stop expanding military bases that threaten the property and rights of the Japanese people. A letter of request with the same content was also sent to U.S. President Eisenhower on the 21st.

　　At the same time, the Hokkaido Trade Union Council announced on the 22nd that it would mobilize workers and farmers in Hokkaido to oppose the U.S. military's plan to conduct atomic rocket artillery exercises in Hokkaido on the 29th. This Hokkaido-wide trade union organization said it feared that allowing the U.S. military to continue the exercises would turn Hokkaido into an American atomic weapons base. The Trade Union Council also telegraphed the Procurement Agency, expressing its opposition to the U.S. military conducting such exercises.

　　日本举行反对美国军事基地全国代表大会
    新华社二十三日讯　东京消息：日本全国反对军事基地联络会议，二十二日在东京举行了第三次全国代表大会。
    参加大会的有立川、新潟、伊丹、板付、木更津和北富士等各地美国军事基地周围的居民代表。
    大会讨论了加强反对美国军事基地斗争的方针。大会决定：要在各个县组织全县规模的反对基地运动，并且向政府和美国大使馆进行反对军事基地的请愿。大会还决定在各县展开签名、募捐活动和广泛举行演讲会等，来扩大反对军事基地运动的规模和影响。
    当天，出席大会的一部分代表再次到美国大使馆进行了请愿。代表们直接会见了美国大使馆人员，递交了给美国驻日大使艾利逊的要求书，要求美国不把原子武器运进日本，停止扩大威胁日本人民的财产和权利的军事基地。同样内容的要求书，在二十一日还寄给了美国总统艾森豪威尔。
    与此同时，北海道工会协议会在二十二日宣布它要动员北海道的工人和农民，来反对美军要在二十九日在北海道演习原子火箭炮的计划。这个全北海道的工会联合组织说，它担心如果允许美国军队演习下去，将会使北海道变成美国的原子武器基地。工会协议会还打电报给调达厅，表示反对美军进行这种演习。
