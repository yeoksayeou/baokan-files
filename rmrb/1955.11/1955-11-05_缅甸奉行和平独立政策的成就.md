    Burma's Achievements in Pursuing a Peaceful and Independent Policy
    Chen Ruhou
    The Union of Burma is one of the independent nations that emerged after World War II. It has over 670,000 square kilometers of fertile land and a hardworking and intelligent population of over 19 million.

    The Burmese people established their own state very early on and created a brilliant culture. The majority of Burmese residents are Buddhists. Near Pagan, there are still five thousand exquisite pagodas, which are one of the treasures of ancient Eastern art and culture.

    However, from the 17th century onwards, Burma suffered from imperialist aggression and plunder. In 1885, Britain occupied Burma and designated it as a province of British colonial India.

    For decades, the Burmese people waged a heroic and steadfast struggle for national independence. In 1937, British imperialism declared Burma separate from India and under direct British rule. During World War II, Burma was also attacked by Japanese militarism. After the war, the Burmese people's movement for national liberation grew even stronger. On January 4, 1948, Burma finally declared its independence from British rule and became an independent nation.

    Since independence, the Burmese government and people have urgently needed a peaceful environment to eliminate the suffering and disasters left to the Burmese people by long-term colonial rule and wartime destruction, and to restore and develop economic and cultural undertakings.

    The Burmese government and people have made many efforts to restore agricultural production, which was severely damaged during the war years. According to materials from the Soviet "Izvestia," in the 1953-1954 fiscal year, Burma's annual rice production had recovered to 5.9 million tons, an increase of 2 million tons compared to the 1946-1947 fiscal year. At the same time, the Burmese government also called for the development of other diverse agricultural production.

    To promote the restoration and development of agriculture, in 1948, the Burmese government passed the "Land Nationalization Act," which stipulated that landowners be compensated and the redeemed land be distributed to farmers. In May 1953, Burmese Minister of Land Nationalization, Tekin Zhen, announced a "Ten-Year Plan" after visiting China and the Soviet Union. According to this plan, the government will distribute 10 million acres of arable land to landless and land-poor farmers. This portion of land accounts for about half of the country's total arable land area. Currently, about 200,000 acres of land have been distributed.

    In terms of industry and commerce, Burma has implemented many measures to strengthen its economic independence and weaken the position of foreign capital. The Burmese government has nationalized many companies that were previously owned by British monopoly capitalists, with compensation, or invested state capital to jointly operate with foreign capital, forming several British-Burmese joint ventures, such as the "New Burma Oil Company of 1954," in which Burma holds one-third of the shares.

    In March 1954, the Burmese government passed an "Economic and Social Development Plan" to develop Burma's industry and agriculture. According to Prime Minister U Nu's speech on July 6 this year, Burma's economic development plan has made good progress, and Burma has made progress in restoring oil facilities and restoring the production of mergui, tin, zinc, lead and other minerals. The quantities of cement, cotton, yarn, sugar, building materials and other basic commodities produced in Burma have increased. Burma's first hydroelectric power project, first pharmaceutical factory and a diesel power project are under construction.

    According to materials from the Soviet "Izvestia," in the 1953-1954 fiscal year, Burma's total production volume had recovered to 80.4 percent of the pre-war level, and this year's production level will increase by another 10 percent.

    The Burmese government has also taken some measures to improve the material and cultural welfare of the people. Many places in Burma are building schools, hospitals, public buildings, welfare centers, etc. The number of schools is now ten times that of pre-war, with more than 875,000 students.

    The Burmese government is not without difficulties in implementing its economic plan. Imperialism is doing its best to hinder Burma's independent and autonomous economic development. Since Burma is a raw material-producing agricultural country, it relies heavily on the import of many industrial products. And imported goods are dependent on Burma's export income to pay. In recent years, the dumping of American rice in the capitalist world market has made Burma's rice exports encounter great difficulties. In the 1952-1953 fiscal year, Burma's rice exports were 1.06 million tons, less than one-third of the pre-war level. The reduction in rice exports has seriously affected Burma's balance of payments.

    In order to ensure the progress of Burma's recovery and construction work, Burma cares about the peace of Asia and the world, opposes colonialism, opposes war, and demands the development of friendly and cooperative relations between countries.

    Prime Minister U Nu said on September 6 this year: "Continuous efforts should be made to eradicate colonialism, which is the root cause of diseases that endanger the cause of peace." At the Asian-African Conference and the United Nations General Assembly, the Burmese government expressed a clear position against colonialism.

    The Burmese government advocates strengthening international cooperation and believes that countries with different social systems can coexist peacefully. In June 1954, the Prime Ministers of Burma and China issued a joint statement confirming the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Prime Minister U Nu believes that: "These five principles are appropriate guiding principles for all countries."

    The Burmese government, together with other Colombo countries, actively initiated and participated in the Asian-African Conference. It has made due contributions to the common cause of maintaining peace in the Asian-African region, opposing colonialism, and promoting friendly cooperation among Asian-African countries.

    Following an independent and peaceful policy, Burma refused to join the military blocs of Western countries that attempted to divide Asian countries. On September 22, 1954, Prime Minister U Nu told reporters: "The 'Southeast Asia Collective Defense' organization itself is for creating war, so the Burmese government expresses its disapproval."

    Prime Minister U Nu has expressed his welcome to the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and the restoration of peace in Indochina.

    The Burmese people, together with all peace-loving people in the world, demand the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction and strive for world peace. Tekin Kodaw Hmaing, Burma's outstanding peace fighter, thus won the Stalin International Peace Prize.

    Burma's peace-loving foreign policy and its contributions to promoting peace, opposing colonialism, and enhancing international friendly cooperation have always been valued by the Soviet Union, China, and other peace-loving countries. These countries are increasingly developing friendly and cooperative relations with Burma based on peaceful coexistence, equality and mutual benefit.

    Our country and Burma established diplomatic relations in 1950. Since 1951, delegations from China and Burma have visited each other continuously. Recently, Burmese Buddhist delegations, cultural delegations, military friendly delegations, national football delegations, and delegations for postal and telecommunications and government procurement have been warmly welcomed by our government and people for their friendly visits and performances in our country. In April 1954, Burma and our country signed an equal and mutually beneficial three-year trade agreement, gradually developing economic exchanges and cooperation. In particular, the mutual visits of the Prime Ministers of the two countries last year greatly strengthened the friendship and mutual understanding between the people of the two countries.

    The Soviet people have always warmly sympathized with and supported the Burmese and Asian people's movement against colonialism and for national independence. After Burma declared its independence in January 1948, the Soviet Union established diplomatic relations with Burma in February of the same year.

    In recent years, the friendship between the Soviet and Burmese people has been continuously increasing. In 1951, a trade union delegation headed by Tekin Lun, chairman of the All-Burma Workers' Association, visited the Soviet Union and was warmly welcomed by the Soviet people. On October 6, 1952, a Burmese delegation headed by Tekin Zhen, Burmese Minister of Land Nationalization, paid a friendly visit to Moscow. In May 1953, the Soviet people warmly received a delegation from the All-Burma Trade Union headed by Bo Maung, Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives of the Burmese Federal Parliament and Deputy Chairman of the All-Burma Trade Union Congress. In July 1953, Tekin Kodaw Hmaing, chairman of the Burmese Committee for the Defense of World Peace, Burma's oldest national poet and historian, and other representatives of the Burmese peace movement visited the Soviet Union.

    Cultural and economic exchanges between the Soviet Union and Burma are also developing year by year. The Burmese-Soviet Cultural Association, formed by people from Burmese cultural circles in Yangon, widely introduced Soviet cultural activities, playing a major role in Burmese-Soviet cultural exchange. In order to promote economic relations, the Soviet Union and Burma have sent trade delegations to visit each other. On July 1, 1955, the Soviet Union and Burma signed a three-year trade agreement and a trade protocol on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. According to this agreement and protocol, Burma will supply the Soviet Union with 150,000 to 200,000 tons of rice within one year, and the Soviet Union will supply Burma with equipment, machinery and other commodities. The Soviet Union also agreed to familiarize Burma with the situation of the Soviet machinery and other commodities it will purchase, and also agreed to send Soviet experts to Burma for consultation. This trade agreement, which is entirely based on equality and mutual benefit, has been warmly praised by the people of the Soviet Union and Burma. The Burmese "Mandalay Daily" pointed out: The Soviet-Burmese trade agreement will definitely help the development of Burma's national economy, will strengthen the economic ties between the Soviet Union and Burma, and will help to expand the area of peace.

    Now, Burmese Prime Minister U Nu has just concluded his friendly visit to the Soviet Union and issued a joint statement with Chairman Bulganin. This not only further developed the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Burma, but also made a major contribution to promoting the cause of world peace.

    缅甸奉行和平独立政策的成就
    陈汝厚
    缅甸联邦是第二次世界大战后出现的独立国家之一。它有六十七万多平方公里的肥沃土地，一千九百多万勤劳智慧的人民。
    缅甸人民很早就建立了自己的国家，创造了光辉灿烂的文化。缅甸居民大部分信奉佛教。在蒲甘附近，至今还存留着五千座玲珑瑰丽的佛塔，是东方的古代艺术文化宝藏之一。
    但是，从十七世纪开始，缅甸便遭受了帝国主义的侵略和掠夺。一八八五年，英国占领了缅甸，并把它划为当时的英国殖民地印度的一省。
    缅甸人民为了争取民族独立，数十年来进行了英勇坚定的斗争。一九三七年，英帝国主义宣布缅甸脱离印度而归英国直接统治。第二次世界大战期间，缅甸又遭受日本军国主义的进攻。战后，缅甸人民争取民族解放运动更加发展。一九四八年一月四日，缅甸终于宣布脱离英国统治而成为独立国家。
    独立以来，缅甸政府和人民迫切需要一个和平的环境，以消除因长期的殖民统治和战争破坏所遗留给缅甸人民的许多痛苦和灾难，恢复和发展经济、文化事业。
    缅甸政府和人民作了许多努力来恢复在战争年代中受了极大损害的农业生产。据苏联“消息报”的材料，到一九五三—一九五四年度，缅甸大米年产量已恢复到五百九十万吨，比一九四六—一九四七年度提高了二百万吨。同时，缅甸政府还号召发展其他多种的农业生产。
    为了促进农业的恢复和发展，一九四八年，缅甸政府通过了“土地国有法令”，规定给地主以补偿方式，把赎买的土地分配给农民。一九五三年五月，缅甸土地国有部长德钦阵访问中苏回国后又宣布了一个“十年计划”。根据这个计划，政府将把一千万英亩可耕地分给无地少地的农民。这部分土地约占国家全部可耕地面积的一半。目前已分配了的土地约为二十万英亩。
    在工商业方面，缅甸曾实行了许多加强自己经济独立、削弱外国资本地位的措施。缅甸政府已把许多过去为英国垄断资本家所有的企业公司，以付给赔偿的方式收归国有，或投入国家资本与外资合营，组成了几个英缅合营公司，例如，缅甸在其中占有三分之一股份的“一九五四年新缅石油公司”。
    一九五四年三月，缅甸政府通过了一项“经济社会发展计划”，以发展缅甸的工农业。据吴努总理在今年七月六日的讲演中说，缅甸的经济发展计划已有良好进展，缅甸在恢复石油设备方面，在恢复麻栗树和锡、锌、铅等矿产的生产方面，都已取得进展。缅甸所生产的水泥、棉花、纱、糖、建筑材料和其他基本商品的数量已有增加。缅甸第一个水力发电工程、第一制药工厂和一个柴油发电工程正在建筑中。
    据苏联“消息报”材料，一九五三—一九五四年度，缅甸的生产总量已恢复到战前水平百分之八十点四，今年的生产水平还将提高百分之十。
    缅甸政府并采取了一些措施来增进人民的物质和文化福利。缅甸的许多地方在修建学校、医院、公共建筑物、福利中心等。目前学校数目已十倍于战前，学生人数为八十七万五千多名。
    缅甸政府在实现它的经济计划时，并不是没有困难的。帝国主义竭力阻挠缅甸经济的独立自主的发展。由于缅甸是个出产原料的农业国，因而在很大程度上依靠许多工业品的进口。而进口货是依赖缅甸的出口收入来偿付的。近几年来，美国大米在资本主义世界市场上的倾销，使缅甸大米的出口遭遇到了很大困难。一九五二—一九五三年度缅甸大米的出口为一百零六万吨，不及战前的三分之一。大米输出的减少，严重地影响到缅甸的支付平衡。
    为了保障缅甸的恢复、建设工作的进行，缅甸关怀亚洲和世界的和平，反对殖民主义，反对战争，要求发展国际间的友好合作关系。
    吴努总理在今年九月六日说：“应当进行不断的努力来根除殖民主义，它是危害和平事业的疾病的根源”。在亚非会议和联合国大会上，缅甸政府都表示了反对殖民主义的明确立场。
    缅甸政府主张加强国际合作，并认为不同社会制度的国家是可以和平共处的。一九五四年六月，缅甸总理和我国总理发表了确认和平共处的五项原则的联合声明。吴努总理认为：“这五项原则对一切国家都是适当的指导原则”。
    缅甸政府和其它科伦坡国家一道，积极发起和参加了亚非会议。它对维护亚非地区的和平、反对殖民主义、促进亚非国家的友好合作这一共同事业，作出了应有的贡献。
    遵循着独立和平的政策，缅甸拒绝参加西方国家企图分裂亚洲国家的军事集团。一九五四年九月二十二日吴努总理对记者说：“‘东南亚共同防御’机构的本身就是为了制造战争，因此缅甸政府表示不欢迎。”
    吴努总理曾表示欢迎朝鲜问题和平解决和在印度支那恢复和平。
    缅甸人民同世界所有爱好和平的人民一道，要求禁止大规模毁灭性武器，争取世界的和平。缅甸卓越的和平战士德钦哥都迈，即因此而获得了斯大林国际和平奖金。
    缅甸所奉行的爱好和平的外交政策和它在促进和平、反对殖民主义、增进国际友好合作方面所作的贡献，一直受到苏联、中国和其他爱好和平的国家的重视。这些国家正在同缅甸日益发展着以和平共处、平等互利为基础的友好合作的关系。
    我国和缅甸在一九五○年就建立了外交关系。一九五一年以来，中缅两国互相访问的代表来往不绝。最近缅甸的佛教代表团、文化代表团，军事友好代表团、国家足球代表团，以及邮电和政府采购等代表团在我国的友好访问和表演，都得到了我国政府和人民的热烈欢迎。一九五四年四月，缅甸与我国签订平等互利的三年贸易协定，逐渐发展着经济上的交流和合作。特别是去年两国总理的互相访问，大大地加强两国人民的友谊和互相了解。
    苏联人民一贯热烈地同情和支持着缅甸和亚洲各国人民反对殖民主义争取民族独立的运动。一九四八年一月缅甸宣布独立以后，苏联在同年二月就和缅甸建立了外交关系。
    近年来，苏缅两国人民的友谊，正在不断地增进。一九五一年以全缅劳工协会主席德钦伦为首的工会代表团访问苏联，受到苏联人民的热烈欢迎。一九五二年十月六日以缅甸土地国有部长德钦阵为首的缅甸代表团到莫斯科进行了友好访问。一九五三年五月，苏联人民又热情地接待了以缅甸联邦国会代表院副议长、全缅工会大会副主席波木昂为首的全缅工会代表团的访问。一九五三年七月，缅甸保卫世界和平委员会主席、最老的民族诗人和历史家德钦哥都迈等缅甸和平运动代表访问了苏联。
    苏缅两国之间的文化交流和经济交流也在逐年发展。缅甸文化界人士在仰光组成的缅苏文化协会广泛地介绍了苏联的文化活动，对缅苏文化交流起了重大作用。为了促进经济关系，苏缅两国曾互派贸易代表团进行访问。一九五五年七月一日，苏缅两国在平等互利的基础上，签订了一项为期三年贸易协定和一项贸易议定书。根据这一协定和议定书，缅甸将在一年内供给苏联大米十五万吨到二十万吨，苏联将供给缅甸以装备机器和其他商品。苏联并同意使缅甸熟悉它将要购买的苏联机器和其他商品的情况，也同意派遣苏联专家到缅进行磋商。这个完全建立在平等互利基础上的贸易协定，受到了苏缅两国人民热烈的赞扬。缅甸“曼岱日报”指出：缅苏贸易协定一定会予缅甸国民经济的发展以很大帮助，将加强苏联和缅甸之间的经济联系，并且将有助于和平地区的扩大。
    现在，缅甸总理吴努刚结束在苏联进行的友好访问，并和布尔加宁主席发表了联合声明。这不仅进一步发展了苏缅两国的友好关系，而且对促进世界和平事业也是个重大的贡献。
