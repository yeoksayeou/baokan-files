Our country's first mechanized small-scale oil extraction plant has been successfully trial-built in Lüda.

The oil extraction rate of this small-scale oil extraction plant is 20% higher than that of automatic screw oil presses, 24% higher than that of hydraulic oil presses, and 37% higher than that of traditional oil workshops (all referring to soybean oil extraction). If all the oil-bearing materials in the country were processed using this type of small-scale oil extraction plant, it could increase the production of vegetable oil by hundreds of thousands of tons per year. Its oil extraction method is as follows: before production, the soybeans or peanut kernels are first rolled into granules using a granulating machine, and then immersed in a benzene solution for about two hours. This allows the protein in the bean granules to remain undamaged or only slightly damaged. The remaining residue after oil extraction can still be used to make tofu or food. During production, workers only need to operate the switches and do not have to do heavy physical labor.

This small-scale oil extraction plant has relatively simple equipment and is very suitable for construction in medium and small cities near raw material producing areas. From October 21st to 25th, the local industrial department held a promotion conference in Lüda City, and decided to build twenty such small-scale oil extraction plants in the oil crop producing areas across the country in 1956 as demonstration projects. During this conference, representatives from the oil industry departments of twelve provinces, including Jilin, Hebei, and Sichuan, observed the operation demonstration of this small-scale oil extraction plant.

This small-scale oil extraction plant will soon be moved to Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, to be put into production. (Lüda People's Daily Editorial Department)

### 我国第一座小型油脂浸出厂试建成功

    我国第一座小型油脂浸出厂试建成功
    我国第一座机械化小型油脂浸出厂在旅大试建成功。
    这座小型油脂浸出厂的出油率，比自动螺旋机榨油厂的出油率高百分之二十，比水压机榨油厂的出油率高百分之二十四，比土榨厂坊的出油率高百分之三十七（以上是指榨豆油）。如果把全国的榨油原料都改用这种小型油脂浸出厂来榨，每年就可以增产几十万吨植物油。它的榨油方法是：生产前先把大豆或花生仁用轧粒机轧成粒，再放入苯溶液中浸泡约两小时，这样能使豆粒中的蛋白质不受破坏或破坏很轻，榨过油后剩下的残粕仍可用来做豆腐或食粮。生产的时候，工人只需操纵开闭器，不用去做笨重的体力劳动。
    这座小型油脂浸出厂，设备比较简单，很适合在原料产地附近的中、小城市建设。地方工业部在十月二十一日到二十五日，在旅大市举行了推广会议，决定一九五六年在全国油料作物产区建设二十座这样的小型油脂浸出厂，作为示范。在这次会议期间，有吉林、河北、四川等十二个省的油脂工业部门的代表，观摩了这座小型油脂浸出厂的操作表演。
    这座小型油脂浸出厂，即将迁往吉林省蛟河县投入生产。　（旅大人民日报编辑部）
