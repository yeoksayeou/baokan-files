Good Intentions, Bad Results

    The fitter group in the mechanical and electrical workshop of the Chongqing Cement Factory needed to manufacture the basket baffle for a rock crusher, requiring 81 kilograms of four-inch thick iron plate, worth 48.60 yuan. The comrades in the fitter group had good intentions to save money, but adopted a bad method. They welded several pieces of scrap iron plate together, resulting in the use of two bottles of oxygen, seven kilograms of welding rods, and seven workers, costing a total of 81.30 yuan. Calculating it, that is: in order to save 48.60 yuan in expenses, they paid a price of 81.30 yuan. After offsetting the difference, they actually spent an additional 32.70 yuan.

    The comrades in this fitter group were doing economic work, but they neglected the economic accounting that is absolutely indispensable in economic work. Good intentions did not achieve good results, and they wasted money instead of saving it.

    好心没得好结果
    重庆水泥厂机电车间钳工组要制造轧石机的篮子挡板，需要四寸厚的铁板八十一公斤，价值四十八元六角。钳工组的同志一片节约的好心，但是却采用了不好的办法。他们将几块废铁板焊在一起，结果，共用了氧气两瓶、焊条七公斤、人工七个，共花八十一元三角。计算一下，那就是：为了节约四十八元六角的开支，而支付了八十一元三角的代价，出入相抵之外，反而不折不扣地多化了三十二元七角。
    这个钳工组的同志作的是经济工作，却偏偏忽略了经济工作中绝对不可缺少的经济核算，好心得不到好结果，为了节约反而浪费了。
