Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 26th: The Japan-China Friendship Association, after holding an emergency standing director's meeting on the 25th, issued a statement on the Japanese government's detention of overseas Chinese, demanding that the Japanese government respect the human rights of overseas Chinese in Japan and listen to the demands of returning overseas Chinese and the Tokyo Overseas Chinese Association.

The statement said: The reasons given by the Japanese government for detaining Hong Jinshan and four others involved in the so-called "Hamamatsu Incident," including Pan Guangkun, are incomprehensible to the Japanese and Chinese people.

The statement pointed out: Whether they are people from Taiwan Province or students, they should have the freedom to return to their motherland according to their own will.

The statement also pointed out: The victims of the Hamamatsu Incident are none other than those who were beaten by the police in the "detention center." The Japanese government is instead prosecuting these people, which is a disregard for the human rights of overseas Chinese in Japan.

The statement said: On the one hand, hoping that the Chinese government will assist Japanese nationals in China to return home and pardon Japanese war criminals in China, while on the other hand, treating overseas Chinese in Japan so harshly, is this tolerable?

　　日中友协就日政府拘留华侨问题发表声明
    新华社二十六日讯　东京消息：日中友好协会在二十五日召开紧急常任理事会后，就日本政府拘留华侨问题发表声明，要求日本政府尊重旅日华侨的人权，倾听归国华侨和东京华侨总会的主张。
    声明说：日本政府拘留洪进山和所谓“滨松事件关系人”潘广坤等四人的理由，都不能使日本人民和中国人民理解。
    声明指出：无论台湾省人也好，留学生也好，都应该有按照自己的意志回到祖国的自由。
    声明又指出：滨松事件的被害人，不外是在“收容所”被警察殴打的人。日本政府反而对这些人起诉，这是无视旅日华侨的人权。
    声明说：一方面盼望中国政府援助在华日侨回国和宽赦在华日本战争罪犯，另一方面对于旅日华侨却予以这样苛刻的待遇，这是能容许的么？
