Xinhua News Agency, November 29th. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions held a banquet on the evening of the 29th to bid farewell to the Japanese Trade Union Delegation headed by Fujita Totaro.

Attending the banquet were Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Liu Ningyi, Vice Chairman, Liu Zihua, Dong Xin, and Zhang Xiuzhu, Secretaries of the Secretariat, members of the Presidium, members of the Executive Committee and heads of various departments, chairmen, vice chairmen, and secretaries-general of various industrial trade unions in China, industrial labor models, advanced production workers, and trade union workers in the capital.

Kaneko Kenta, a Japanese trade union worker in Beijing, was also invited to attend the banquet.

At the beginning of the banquet, Lai Ruoyu said in his speech that after this period of pleasant life together with the delegation, our understanding and friendship with each other has become deeper and more developed. In this harmonious meeting, we have reached a consensus on many important issues and reached an agreement, which is the first time in the history of trade unions between China and Japan. This will play a great role in the friendly unity of the trade unions and the working classes of the two countries, and will also have an impact on the unity between trade unions in Asia and Africa. He wished that the friendly unity between the trade unions of the two countries would be further developed and consolidated based on this agreement.

Subsequently, Fujita Totaro delivered a speech expressing his gratitude for the warm hospitality of the hosts.

It is regrettable that diplomatic relations between Japan and China have not yet been restored, and we will do our utmost to normalize them as soon as possible. He said that the delegation will also actively strive to promote the further development of economic and cultural exchanges between the two countries, to consolidate and deepen the friendly unity between the workers of China and Japan as well as Asia and the world, and to realize the agreement reached between the delegation and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions.

During the banquet, the guests and hosts exchanged gifts and shouted in unison: "Long live the solidarity of the workers of China and Japan!"
