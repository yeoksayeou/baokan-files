    Construction of Martyrs' Memorial Tower in Haimen District, Zhejiang

    In order to permanently commemorate the outstanding sons and daughters of the motherland—the Chinese People's Liberation Army soldiers—who heroically sacrificed themselves in the battles of liberating Yijiangshan Island and other coastal islands of Zhejiang, the Zhejiang Provincial People's Committee has decided to build a Martyrs' Memorial Tower, Memorial Pavilion, and Memorial Stele on Fengshan Mountain in Haimen District, where the remains of the martyrs are buried, and to build a martyrs' cemetery. The construction project commenced on October 25th.

    According to the design of the memorial tower and other projects, stone lions and paifangs are arranged at the foot of the mountain, and stone steps lead to the high ground where the memorial tower is built. The memorial tower is seventeen meters high, and a luminous five-pointed red star is installed on the top of the tower. Statues of the army, navy, and air force are erected on the base of the tower. The martyrs' tombs are arranged in a circular pattern, and in the center of the martyrs' tombs are the Memorial Pavilion and Memorial Stele. Comprehensive landscaping will be carried out in the cemetery. The entire project is expected to be completed in January 1956.

    浙江海门区兴建烈士纪念塔
    为了永久纪念在解放一江山等浙江沿海岛屿战斗中壮烈牺牲的优秀的祖国儿女—中国人民解放军战士，浙江省人民委员会决定在安葬烈士遗体的海门区枫山建造烈士纪念塔、纪念亭、纪念碑，并修建烈士墓。建造工程已于十月二十五日开工。
    根据纪念塔等工程的设计，在山麓排列着石狮、牌坊，有石阶通向建立纪念塔的高地。纪念塔高十七公尺，塔顶装有能照明的五角红星，塔基上树立着陆、空、海军的塑像。烈士墓呈环形排列，烈士墓中央是纪念亭、纪念碑，并在陵园中进行全面绿化。全部工程预计一九五六年一月完工。
