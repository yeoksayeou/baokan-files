Sino-Japanese Trade Has Broad Prospects
Du Bo

The Chinese Commodity Exhibition held in Tokyo has closed. On the opening day of the exhibition, American news agencies—Associated Press and International News Service—colluded to spread a big lie. They said in unison that the most eye-catching things in the Chinese Commodity Exhibition were just consumer goods, and that the industrial equipment made in China was "almost ignored by the Japanese." They even said that among the minerals, agricultural products, machines, and handicrafts displayed at the exhibition, "only a few items are needed by Japan." The distorted propaganda of the American news agencies about this exhibition was obviously arranged by Washington in advance.

Why did they lie? They wanted to belittle the significance and value of this exhibition, and undermine the good influence it had on the Japanese people, in order to hinder the further development of Sino-Japanese trade relations. This is consistent with the US government's consistent policy of hindering Sino-Japanese trade.

However, the facts completely refuted the arbitrary propaganda of the American news agencies. Since its opening, the Chinese Commodity Exhibition has been warmly welcomed by people from all walks of life in Japan. The number of visitors averaged nearly 40,000 per day, and Kyodo News also said that this was an unprecedented event in Japan. Due to the demands of all sectors of Japan, the exhibition had to be extended for three days beyond the original date.

Contrary to the American propaganda, Japanese people not only liked Chinese ivory carvings and beautiful embroidered satin, but they were particularly interested in China's heavy industrial products. China's newly produced lathes, planers, combined coal mining machines, and various industrial equipment attracted countless viewers. Japanese public opinion and people from all walks of life generally expressed surprise and admiration for the tremendous achievements China has made in industrial construction. Japan's "Sangyo Keizai Shimbun" published an editorial on the 19th, saying that among the various exhibits at the Chinese Commodity Exhibition, machine tools, mining machinery, and electrical equipment especially attracted the attention of the audience. The newspaper pointed out that China had almost no heavy industry in the past, but since the founding of New China, it has developed to the point where it can manufacture these machines, which cannot be ignored. Asagoe Tetsutaro, a professor of engineering at Tokyo Chuo University, said during a visit to the exhibition: "The important parts of the machinery are very strong, which is very different from the fact that Western European countries only consider the commercial nature of the machinery when producing it. I am really surprised that you have made such great progress in such a short period of time." It is clear that the American news agencies' attempt to dilute the Japanese audience's strong impression of China's industrial construction achievements with slanderous propaganda was a waste of effort.

The Chinese Commodity Exhibition showed that many of China's commodities are needed by Japan. Among the more than 100 kinds of mineral products on display, there are high-quality coal, iron sand, and various ores; Japan used to import these things from China. Other items such as soybeans, salt, and various local products, animal products, and food are also needed by Japan. With the rapid development of China's industry and agriculture, the output and quality of these commodities are increasing and improving, which can not only meet the growing needs of the domestic people, but also supply exports. From the exhibition, it can also be seen that China's large-scale economic construction requires a lot of construction materials, and many industrial products from Japan are also needed by China. Tajima Masao, the head of the Japanese business delegation that returned from China a few days ago, said in Hong Kong one day: "I think China's purchasing power is growing day by day, because it is engaged in large-scale economic construction and needs not only machinery and equipment and industrial equipment from Japan, but also from other countries." This shows that there are many commodities that can be exchanged between China and Japan, and that trade between the two countries has broad prospects.

Uematsu Eikichi, the head of the Japanese Diet members' delegation to China who recently returned from China, said after visiting the Chinese Commodity Exhibition that he hopes to establish this kind of commodity exhibition as a permanent institution, and at the same time handle liaison affairs related to trade between the two sides, in order to promote the further development of trade relations between China and Japan. This represents the general desire of Japanese industrialists and businessmen.

There are conditions for developing trade between China and Japan, and the industrial and commercial circles of the two countries also have the desire to expand trade; however, in recent years, trade between the two countries has not been fully developed as it should be. This is entirely due to the "embargo" policy imposed on the Japanese people by the United States. Even during the Chinese Commodity Exhibition, the United States continued to put pressure on the Japanese government, demanding that the Japanese government punish Japanese pig bristle product manufacturers and traders who are believed to be using Chinese raw materials. This shows that only by eliminating this artificial obstacle can the Japanese people fully and autonomously grasp their own right to foreign trade, and trade relations between China and Japan can be greatly advanced.

During the Chinese Commodity Exhibition, many Japanese politicians and business people expressed their desire to continue to work hard to overcome the obstacles hindering the development of Sino-Japanese trade, so that equal and mutually beneficial trade relations between China and Japan can be smoothly developed, which is in the fundamental interests of the Japanese people.

### 中日贸易有着广阔的前途

    中日贸易有着广阔的前途
    杜波
    在东京举办的中国商品展览会已经闭幕了。展览会开幕的头一天，美国通讯社——美联社和国际新闻社串通起来撒了一个大谎。它们一齐说，中国商品展览会中最引人注意的东西只是一些消费品，中国制造的工业装备“几乎受到日本人漠视”。它们甚至说，展览会陈列的矿砂、农业产品、机器和手工业产品中，“只有很少物品是日本所需要的”。美国通讯社对这个展览会的歪曲宣传，显然是华盛顿在事先就布置好了的。
    它们为什么要扯谎呢？它们是想要贬低这个展览会的意义和价值，破坏它在日本人民中所产生的良好影响，以阻碍中日贸易关系的进一步发展。这同美国政府一向阻碍中日贸易的政策是一致的。
    但是，事实完全驳倒了美国通讯社的武断宣传。中国商品展览会从开幕以来，一直受到日本各界人士的热烈欢迎。参观的人数平均每天达到将近四万人，共同社也说这在日本是空前没有的盛况。由于日本各界的要求，展览会不得不按原定日期延期三天闭幕。
    同美国的宣传恰好相反，日本人士不但喜爱中国象牙雕刻和漂亮的刺绣缎面等消费品，而且他们对中国的重工业产品特别感觉兴趣。中国新出产的各种镟床、刨床、联合采煤机和各种工业器材，都吸引了无数的观众。日本舆论和各界人士对中国工业建设所获得的巨大成就，普遍表示惊奇和赞扬。日本“产业经济新闻”在十九日发表社论说：在中国商品展览会的各种展品当中，工作母机、矿山机械、电气器材等特别引起观众的注意。这家报纸指出，中国在从前几乎没有重工业，新中国成立以来，竟发展到能制造这些机械的程度，这是不容忽视的。东京中央大学工科教授浅居彻太郎在参观展览会时说：“机械的重要部分非常坚固，这和西欧诸国只考虑机械的商品性而进行生产这一点是大不相同的。现在你们在这样短的期间有了这样大的进步，实在使我惊讶。”美国通讯社力图用诽谤宣传来冲淡日本观众对中国工业建设成就的强烈印象，显然是白费心机的。
    中国商品展览会显示，中国的许多商品都是日本所需的。在展出的一百多种矿产品中，有质量优良的煤、铁砂和各种矿石；日本过去都是从中国输入这些东西的。其他如大豆、食盐和各种土产、畜产、食品，也为日本所需要。随着中国工农业的迅速发展，这些商品的产量和质量都在增加和提高，不仅可以满足国内人民日益增长的需要，而且可以供应出口。从展览会也可以看到，中国大规模的经济建设，需要的建设物资很多，日本的许多工业产品也是中国所需要的。前几天离开中国的日本工商界访华代表团团长田岛正雄一日在香港就曾说：“我认为中国的购买力是正在日益增长，因为它在从事于大规模的经济建设，不仅需要从日本得到机器装备和工业器材，还需要从其他国家获得它们。”这说明中日两国有着很多可以交换的商品，两国之间的贸易有着广阔的前途。
    最近从中国回去的日本国会议员访华团团长上林山荣吉，在参观中国商品展览会后表示，他希望把这种商品展览会作为常设的机构，同时处理有关双方贸易的联络事务，以促进中日两国间贸易关系的进一步发展。这代表了日本工商企业家的普遍愿望。
    中日两国间存在着发展贸易的条件，两国工商业界也有扩大贸易的愿望；然而，近几年来两国间的贸易却没有得到应有的充分发展。这完全是美国强加在日本人民头上的“禁运”政策造成的。就在中国商品展览会期间，美国依然在向日本政府施加压力，要日本政府惩罚被认为使用中国原料的日本猪鬃产品制造商和贸易商。这说明，只有消除这种人为的障碍，日本人民能够充分自主地掌握住自己对外贸易的权利，中日两国间的贸易关系才有可能得到长足的进展。
    在中国商品展览会期间，许多日本政界人士和工商界人士都曾表示，要继续努力克服这种阻挠中日贸易发展的障碍，使中日两国间平等互利的贸易关系得到顺畅的发展，这是符合日本人民的根本利益的。
