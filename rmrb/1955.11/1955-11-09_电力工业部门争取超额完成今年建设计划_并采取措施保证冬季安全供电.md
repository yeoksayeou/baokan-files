The state-owned electricity industry sector is striving to overfulfill this year's basic construction plan. From October 17th to 23rd, the Basic Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry held a basic construction conference to specifically discuss and arrange measures to strive for overfulfillment of tasks. It is expected that the annual plan for thermal power generation projects and power transmission and transformation projects can be overfulfilled by 2%.

By the end of October, many basic construction units of the state-owned electricity industry sector had completed this year's machinery installation project plan and had begun trial operation. Currently, fourteen sets of power generation equipment have been officially put into production, and eight sets are undergoing trial operation and will soon be put into production. Major power transmission line projects have completed 535 kilometers. These completed power generation equipment provide a large amount of power for industrial construction in various regions. For example, the Taiyuan Thermal Power Plant recently completed the first phase of its construction project, doubling its power generation capacity and ensuring the needs of industrial electricity consumption. The 110,000-volt high-voltage transmission lines constructed in vast areas across the country this year will also be completed on schedule one after another. For example, after the line from Guanting Reservoir to Beijing is put into operation, it will connect power plants from Xiahuayuan to Tangshan into a power grid. When the Guanting Hydropower Station is completed, industrial production in this area will obtain a more sufficient and reliable power supply.

This year, the construction of the electricity industry has made full use of old equipment, which has not only shortened the construction time but also saved construction funds for the country. Recently, factories such as Fengfeng, Baotou, Hongshan, Huainan, Xiashesi, Lanzhou, and Zaozhuang have installed and repaired old equipment, with a total capacity of more than 30,000 kilowatts.

In order to accelerate the construction of the electricity industry and ensure the smooth completion of the Five-Year Plan, the Basic Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry has decided to promote eighteen advanced experiences in various units to speed up construction, save national investment, and ensure the quality of projects.

本报讯　State-owned power supply units are taking measures to meet the winter peak load and ensure safe winter power supply. In October, the Ministry of Electric Power Industry organized a special working group, under the guidance of Soviet experts, to comprehensively inspect the preparation work of the Beijing Shijingshan Power Plant for the winter peak load. Soviet experts pointed out more than 200 problems that should be solved, which is of great help in ensuring safe winter power generation. While inspecting the work of the Shijingshan Power Plant, the Ministry of Electric Power Industry also organized plant directors from more than a dozen power plants across the country to observe and promote the Shijingshan Power Plant's experience in preparing for peak load.

Currently, power supply bureaus and power plants in Fengfeng, Datong, Tangshan, Shijiazhuang, Xiahuayuan, and other places in North China are carrying out preparations for the winter peak load. The Shenyang Electric Power Administration and various electric power bureaus in Northeast China are also making arrangements for safely passing the peak load, combined with the specific conditions of equipment and climate characteristics in various regions. In order to improve the technical level of operators and prevent accidents during the peak load period, electric power units in various places have strengthened the training and education of employees. In terms of cold protection, frost prevention, and fire prevention, electric power units in various places are also taking necessary measures.

    电力工业部门争取超额完成今年建设计划
    并采取措施保证冬季安全供电
    本报讯　国营电力工业部门，正在争取超额完成今年基本建设计划。从十月十七日到二十三日，电力工业部基本建设总局召开了基本建设会议，具体地讨论和安排了争取超额完成任务的措施，预计，火力发电工程和送变电工程的年度计划可以争取超额完成百分之二。
    到十月底止，国营电力工业部门的许多基本建设单位已完成了今年机器安装工程的计划，并已开始试运转。目前，已经正式投入生产的有十四套发电设备，正在试运转即可投入生产的八套，主要的送电线路工程已完成了五百三十五公里。这些已建成的发电设备，为各地区的工业建设提供了大量的动力来源。如太原电热站最近完成了第一期建设工程，发电能力比原来增加了一倍多，保证了工业用电的需要。今年以来，在全国广大地区建设的十一万伏的高压送电线路，也将陆续按期完成。如官厅水库到北京的线路运行后，将使下花园直到唐山的电厂连结成一个电力网，等官厅水力发电站建成，这一地区的工业生产就可获得更充足和更可靠的电源。
    今年电力工业的建设充分利用了残旧设备，这不仅缩短了建设时间，而且为国家节省了建设资金。最近安装修复残旧设备的有峰峰、包头、洪山、淮南、下摄司、兰州、枣庄等厂，容量共三万多瓩。
    为了加速电力工业建设，保证五年计划的顺利完成，电力工业部基本建设总局已决定在各单位推广十八种先进经验，以加快建设速度，节省国家投资，保证工程的质量。
    本报讯　国营电业单位采取措施，迎接冬季高峰负荷，保证冬季安全供电。电力工业部在十月份组织了专门工作组，在苏联专家的指导下，全面检查了北京石景山发电厂为迎接冬季高峰负荷而进行的准备工作。苏联专家指出了两百多个应该解决的问题，对保证冬季安全发电有很大帮助。电力工业部在检查石景山发电厂工作的同时，还组织了全国各地区十几个电厂的厂长进行观摩，推广石景山发电厂迎接高峰负荷的工作经验。
    目前，华北地区峰峰、大同、唐山、石家庄、下花园等地的电业局、发电厂都正在进行迎接冬季高峰负荷的准备工作。沈阳电业管理局和东北各电业局也正在结合各地区设备的具体情况和气候特点，布置安全渡过高峰负荷的工作。为了提高运行人员的技术水平，防止高峰负荷时期事故的发生，各地电业单位加强了对职工的训练和教育。在防寒、防冻和消防工作方面，各地电业单位也正在采取必要的措施。
