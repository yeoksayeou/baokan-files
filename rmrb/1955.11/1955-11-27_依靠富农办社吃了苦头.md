　　Suffering from Relying on Rich Peasants to Run Cooperatives
    Editor:
    After studying Chairman Mao's instructions on the question of agricultural cooperation, I examined the serious mistakes I had made in the past in implementing the Party's class line in rural areas.

    Although the Party repeatedly told us that we should resolutely rely on the poor peasants in rural work, I simply refused to listen to the Party. I remember during the slack season last year, our Guanghua Agricultural Cooperative wanted to expand. At the time, I thought: rich peasants have good carts, strong horses, and plenty of capital; having one more household means one more share of strength; poor peasants have no carts, no horses, and a thin family fortune; having one less household means one less burden. Therefore, I admitted eleven rich peasant households into the agricultural cooperative; conversely, I kept more than thirty poor peasant households outside the agricultural cooperative.

    After these rich peasants joined the cooperative, things immediately became difficult to manage. From the beginning, they used the excuse of "poor households don't invest, so we won't invest either" to avoid carrying out the investment plan. For example, the newly rich peasant Zhang Zhongying used to manage his own fruit trees and dry land, requiring an investment of more than 450 yuan. When he joined the cooperative, he originally reported an investment of 400 yuan, but in the end, he was only willing to invest 30 yuan. Under their influence, many well-to-do middle peasants were also unwilling to actively invest. As a result, the cooperative didn't have the money to buy medicine to treat insect pests on the fruit trees in June, causing the apples to be damaged by insects, and the average price per pound was reduced by two cents, resulting in a large loss for the entire cooperative of 600,000 pounds of apples!

    These rich peasants were passive and sabotaged while working. For example, during the busy season of drought resistance and cotton planting in the spring, the cooperative members were busy planting, but the newly rich peasant Mu Xuesheng did not work and even told others: "Let's all work slowly in our team, the work quota will be lower, and we can achieve it without much effort." When applying topdressing fertilizer in the sorghum field in the summer, he disliked the smell of manure, refused to work, and took three cooperative members to take a bath with him.

    These rich peasants also deliberately damaged public property in the cooperative. For example, the wife of the newly rich peasant Wang Zuozhong used a stick to hit the fruit trees randomly when thinning the fruit, damaging the fruit trees. Before spring plowing, several rich peasant households who were in charge of driving carts refused to implement the decision of the cooperative's management committee and insisted on taking the rubber-tired carts to Dongshan to haul firewood. The mountain roads were difficult to travel, the axles were broken, and the tires were punctured. In addition to this, some rich peasants deliberately blinded the eyes of the cooperative's collective mules and horses, causing great losses.

    Because the rich peasants were carrying out sabotage activities in the cooperative, the thinking of the cooperative members was very confused at the time, and more than thirty households wanted to withdraw from the cooperative; the labor enthusiasm of the general cooperative members was also not high, and the cooperative's production was very bad. One-third of the orchard, cotton field, and sorghum field were overgrown with weeds, looking like a wasteland.

    Because I did not recognize the class nature of the rich peasants and blindly tried to rely on the rich peasants to run the cooperative well, the facts educated me that doing so would only ruin the cooperative.

    This time, under the leadership and assistance of the county Party committee's work group, and in accordance with the spirit of the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Party, our Party branch criticized erroneous thinking, examined our work, and made a comprehensive plan for the agricultural cooperation movement in our village. Our Guanghua Cooperative has already expelled the rich peasant elements who were causing trouble in the cooperative and admitted a group of poor and lower-middle peasants into the cooperative. These new cooperative members have a high degree of enthusiasm for taking the socialist road, and they work vigorously after joining the cooperative; the emotions of the old cooperative members have also changed. In the future, I am determined to correctly implement the class line of "relying on the poor peasants and firmly uniting with the middle peasants" and strive to run the agricultural producers' cooperative well.

### 依靠富农办社吃了苦头

　　依靠富农办社吃了苦头编辑同志：
    学习了毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的指示后，我检查了过去执行党在农村的阶级路线中所犯的严重错误。
    党虽然一再告诉我们，在农村工作中应该坚决依靠贫农；可是我却偏偏不肯听党的话。记得在去年挂锄期间，我们光华农业社要扩大。当时我想：富农车好马强资金多，多一户多一分力量；贫农没车没马家底薄，少一户少一分负担。于是，就吸收了十一户富农参加农业社；相反地却把三十多户贫农关在农业社的门外。
    这些富农入社以后，社里的事情马上不好办了。一开始，他们就用“贫困户不投资、我们也不投资”作借口，不执行投资计划。像新富农张中英，在入社前自己侍弄果树和旱田，需要四百五十多元钱的投资，入社的时候原报投资四百元，结果只肯投资三十元钱。在他们的影响下，不少富裕中农也不肯积极投资了。结果，社里因为六月间没有钱买药给果树治虫，使苹果遭了虫害，每斤平均少卖了二分钱，全社六十万斤苹果的损失就大了！
    这些富农在干活的时候就消极怠工，进行破坏。如春天抗旱种棉花的紧张时期，社员们忙着种地，新富农慕学盛却不出工，还对别人说：“咱们全队都慢点作活，作业定额就低了，再不用费劲就能达到了。”夏季高粱地里施追肥的时候，他又嫌大粪有臭味，不愿意干活，拉了三个社员一起去洗澡。
    这些富农在社里还故意破坏公共财产。像新富农王作忠的老婆在稀果的时候，用棍子乱打，损害果树。春耕前，担任赶车的几户富农不执行社里管理委员会的决定，硬把胶轮车套到东山去拉大柴，山道不好走，车轴磨断了，车胎压破了。这还不算，有的富农还故意把社里公有骡马的眼睛打瞎，造成很大的损失。
    由于富农在社里进行破坏活动，当时社员的思想十分混乱，有三十多户想要退社；一般社员劳动情绪也都不高，社里生产搞得很糟糕。果树园、棉花地和高粱地，有三分之一是草苗齐长，荒得真不像个样子。
    我因为没有认清富农的阶级本质，妄想依靠富农办好社，结果事实教育了我，这样做只会把社搞垮。
    这次我们党支部在县委工作组的领导和帮助下，根据党的六中全会决议的精神，批判了错误思想，检查了工作，作出了本村农业合作化运动的全面规划。我们光华社已经开除了在社里捣乱的富农分子，吸收了一批贫农和下中农入社。这些新社员走社会主义道路的积极性很高，入社以后就起劲地干活；老社员的情绪也转变了。今后我决心要正确地执行“依靠贫农、巩固地团结中农”的阶级路线，努力把农业生产合作社办好。
