　　Beijing News: This year, nine industries in Beijing's private sector are about to implement joint state-private ownership by industry. The flour industry formally completed industry-wide joint state-private ownership in October. The motor, pharmaceutical, machine dyeing, and machine paper-making industries have signed joint state-private ownership agreements and are in the process of preparing for official joint state-private ownership, including inventorying assets and merging factories. The oil, candied fruit, and other four industries are brewing industry-wide joint state-private ownership.

　　The private factories in these industries have scattered and backward production equipment, and many shortcomings in management and operation. During the private period, they could not smoothly develop production in accordance with the needs of national construction and people's lives. Some factories, despite strong state support, still could not balance income and expenditure. After the flour industry completed industry-wide joint state-private ownership, it began centralized production in November, with unified allocation of manpower and material resources. The production equipment of advanced factories has been fully utilized, and product costs are expected to decrease by an average of about 10%. The industry's funds have been centralized, and profits and losses will be calculated uniformly, which can completely reverse the situation of frequent losses in some factories in the past. Other industries will also coordinate production and carry out economic restructuring during the preparation for joint state-private ownership and after joint state-private ownership, so as to rationally use manpower and material resources. For example, the 15 factories in the motor industry will be merged and reorganized under the unified leadership of the Beijing Motor Company, adopting the method of large factories leading small factories and advanced factories leading backward factories, and will appropriately divide the work for specialized production according to national needs and the characteristics of each factory.

　　Workers in each factory are very enthusiastic about joint state-private ownership by industry. During the preparation for joint state-private ownership in Shou Zong Motor Factory, workers successfully trial-produced a new product, the exhaust fan. While actively carrying out the preparatory work for joint state-private ownership, the workers of Ci Hua Machine Dyeing Factory worked hard to improve operating techniques and increase the amount of cloth dyed. In October, they not only completed the production plan but also dyed 3,000 more bolts of cloth. Capitalists in many factories also actively participated in the preparatory work for joint state-private ownership.

　　北京私营工业有九个行业就要实行公私合营
    本报讯　今年北京市私营工业中有九个行业即将按行业实行公私合营。面粉业在十月间已经正式全行业公私合营。电机、制药、机器染布和机器造纸四个行业已经签订公私合营协议书，正在进行清点资产、并厂等正式公私合营的筹备工作。油脂、果脯等四个行业正在酝酿按行业公私合营。
    这些行业的私营工厂生产设备分散落后，经营管理上缺点很多，私营期间都不能按照国家建设和人民生活的需要顺利地发展生产。有的工厂虽经国家大力扶植，收支仍不能平衡。面粉业全行业公私合营以后，从十一月份开始集中生产，人力、物力统一调配，先进厂的生产设备得到充分发挥，产品成本预计平均可以降低百分之十左右。全业资金已经集中，并且将统一计算盈亏，过去部分厂经常亏损的局面可以彻底扭转。其他行业在筹备公私合营期间和公私合营以后，也将统筹安排生产，进行经济改组，以便合理地使用人力和物力。如电机业的十五家工厂，就要在北京市电机公司的统一领导下，采取以大带小、以先进带落后的办法，进行合并改组，并且根据国家需要和各厂特点，适当分工进行专业生产。
    各厂职工对按行业公私合营都热情很高。守宗电机厂筹备公私合营期间，工人们试制成功了新产品排气风扇。慈华机染厂职工一面积极进行公私合营的筹备工作，一面努力改进操作技术，提高染布量。十月份，他们不但完成了生产计划，还多染了三千匹布。许多工厂的资本家也积极参加了公私合营的筹备工作。
