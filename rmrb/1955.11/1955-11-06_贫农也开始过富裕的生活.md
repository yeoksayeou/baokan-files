    Poor Peasants Also Begin to Live a Prosperous Life

    Editor:
    Recently, I learned about the changes in the life of a poor peasant member of the "May 1st" Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xingzhangzhuang Township, Yutian County. From this, we can see the benefits that agricultural cooperation brings to farmers.

    Before the land reform, the poor peasant Zhang Tianhu's family of twelve had only five mu of land, mainly relying on working for landlords and cultivating land for rent. The grain they earned each year was only enough to feed them through the winter, and they were constantly in debt. Everyone in the village knew that "Zhang Tianhu's family was in famine every year."

    After the land reform in 1948, his family received twenty-eight mu of land, which, together with the original five mu, totaled thirty-three mu, and their life was much better than before. However, due to the family's poor foundation and weak labor force, they could not manage the crops well, so they still did not have enough grain to eat and were short of food every spring. In 1949, the area suffered a severe flood, and his family borrowed money again. In 1950, they had to sell three mu of land to pay off the debt. It looked like things were getting worse year by year.

    In 1953, after studying the general task of the state during the transition period, Zhang Tianhu deeply felt from his own experience that the only way out was to take the road of cooperation. So he and other farmers organized an agricultural production cooperative of fifteen households. As expected, because the agricultural cooperative implemented collective labor and unified management, although there were some floods that year, they still increased production compared to when they worked individually in previous years. Zhang Tianhu's family of thirteen (one more person after the land reform) had three full laborers and two female half-laborers. The whole family did a total of 471.5 workdays. Adding the income from land dividends, they received a total of 5,368 jin of grain, about 1,400 jin more than when they worked individually, and their life was better than before.

    After the autumn of 1954, the three small cooperatives and six mutual aid teams in the village merged into a large cooperative of 111 households. Because the superiority of the large cooperative was even more significant, Zhang Tianhu's income this year was much better than last year. Although his son went to serve in the army this February, reducing a full laborer in the family, and the number of workdays done by the whole family was 77 less than last year, and the land dividend was reduced from 50% to 45%, according to the pre-distribution plan, his family can receive 7,133 jin of grain, which is not only enough for a year's consumption, but also has a surplus of 1,800 to 1,900 jin by the time of the next autumn harvest.

    This fact has strengthened Zhang Tianhu's determination and confidence to take the socialist road. He said excitedly: "Not only do I have surplus grain at home, but I also have a share of the livestock, rubber-wheeled carts, waterwheels, and double-wheeled double-shared plows in the cooperative! I will resolutely take the cooperative as my home and work hard to live a happier and better life in the future."

### 贫农也开始过富裕的生活

    贫农也开始过富裕的生活编辑同志：
    最近我了解了玉田县邢张庄乡“五一”农业生产合作社的一户贫农社员生活变化的情况，从这里可以看出农业合作化给农民带来的好处。
    贫农张天护，在土地改革以前，全家十二口人只有五亩土地，主要依靠给地主扛活和种分收地为生。他家每年收入的粮食只能糊一冬的口，成年累月欠着债。全村的人谁都知道：“张天护的饥荒年年有”。
    一九四八年土地改革以后，他家分到了二十八亩田地，加上原有的五亩，一共是三十三亩，生活比以前要好多了。但是由于家底空虚，人力单薄，庄稼就一直侍弄不好，因此粮食仍然不够吃用，每年到春天就缺粮食。一九四九年当地遭受了严重的水灾，他家又借了债，一九五○年就只好忍痛卖掉三亩地来还。眼看着光景又一年不如一年了。
    一九五三年，张天护学习了国家在过渡时期的总任务以后，从自己的切身经历中深深感到只有走合作化的道路才是唯一的出路。于是他同其他农民一道组织了一个十五户的农业生产合作社。果然，由于农业社实行了集体劳动，统一经营，虽然当年有些水灾，但他们还是比往年单干的时候增了产。张天护全家十三口人（土地改革后又增一口人），有三个整劳动力，两个妇女半劳动力，全家共做了四百七十一点五个劳动日，再加上土地分红收入，共分粮食五千三百六十八斤，比单干的时候多收入了一千四百斤左右，生活比以前强了。
    一九五四年秋后，全村三个小社、六个互助组合并成了一个一百十一户的大社。由于大社的优越性更加显著，张天护今年的收入又比去年强得多。虽然今年二月他的儿子去服兵役，家里减少了一个整劳动力，全家做的劳动日工比去年少了七十七个，同时土地分红又由百分之五十降低为百分之四十五，但是按照预分方案估算，他家能分粮食七千一百三十三斤，不但够一年吃用，而且到明年大秋还能有一千八、九百斤的富余。
    这个事实，使张天护走社会主义道路的决心和信心更加强了。他兴奋地说：“我不但家里有了余粮；社里的牲口、胶皮大车、水车、双轮双铧犁还有我一份哪！我要坚决以社为家，好好地搞下去，将来过更加幸福美满的生活。”
