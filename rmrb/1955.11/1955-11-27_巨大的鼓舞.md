　　Great Inspiration
　　By Our Correspondent Jian Yuan
    On the morning of November 26th, at the Beijing Shooting Range, a beautiful flag symbolizing the sport of shooting was slowly lowered amidst the sounds of the Chinese national anthem.
  “The 1955 International Friendship Shooting Competition" was declared closed. During these ten days from November 17th to 26th, athletes from various countries wholeheartedly exchanged shooting experiences in an atmosphere of friendship.
    At the competition, the shooting of the Soviet shooting athletes was particularly brilliant. The Soviet team won four out of the total five events in this competition and won the overall championship of all events.  B.P. Perepelkin, a fitter from Leningrad and a Meritorious Athlete of the Soviet Union, drew the most attention in the military rifle shooting competition, where he won the individual championship. O.M. Zhgutov, a teacher from Moscow and a Meritorious Athlete of the Soviet Union, won the individual championship in the men's 25-meter rapid fire silhouette pistol shooting event with an excellent score of hitting all sixty targets and scoring 582 rings.  Female athletes paid special attention to Soviet female sports star Z.M. Kolmushkina, a teacher at a construction college in Kuibyshev.  She won individual championships in both women's events.  Also, V.N. Shamburkin, a Soviet sports star who won the championship in the men's small-bore rifle shooting competition, became a role model for athletes from various brotherly countries.
    Romanian athletes achieved the second-highest total score in this competition. When they first arrived in Beijing, they expressed their desire to learn from the shooting experiences of the representative teams from various brotherly countries as much as possible. M. Dokilicha won third place in the men's rapid fire silhouette small-bore pistol event. Female sports star M. Zhuvierganu won third place in the women's 50-meter small-bore rifle prone, kneeling, and standing shooting competition. A couple of shooters, Yo. Serbu and Ai. Serbu, also performed well in this competition. Ai. Serbu won third place in the women's 50-meter small-bore rifle standing shooting event.
    The Bulgarian shooting athletes, who came to Beijing with songs of peace and smiles of friendship, also achieved good results.  L.G. Vasileva, a female teacher and first-grade athlete, won second place in the women's 50-meter and 100-meter small-bore rifle prone shooting event this time.  V.V. Khristov, a first-grade athlete and a worker at a metallurgical factory, won third place in the men's 50-meter small-bore rifle prone shooting event.  T.G. Kozlovsky scored 501 rings in the military rifle shooting event, which was 13 rings higher than his domestic score, and his score in the small-bore rifle event also improved compared to his domestic score. Thanks to these excellent athletes who are good at learning, the Bulgarian shooting team won the third-highest total score in this competition.
    Athletes from Czechoslovakia, Poland, Mongolia, North Korea, and other countries also achieved good results during these friendly days. The Czechoslovakian representative team for the men's 25-meter rapid fire silhouette small-bore pistol event won the runner-up with a score of hitting all 240 targets and scoring 2196 rings. The audience cheered especially for their victory. Polish sports star V. Salvitska won third place in the women's 50-meter small-bore rifle kneeling shooting event this time. Another female sports star, S.M. Marshivchik, improved her scores in the 50-meter and 100-meter small-bore rifle prone shooting events by 15 rings compared to her scores in Poland. Kim De-kyung, a lathe operator from the Sinuiju Ironworks in North Korea, told his Chinese friends that he had improved his military rifle shooting skills during these days. His highest score in the country was only 89 rings for ten shots, but now he can reach 96 rings.
    During these friendly days, our athletes received great help from Soviet athletes.  B.P. Perepelkin, a Meritorious Athlete of the Soviet Union, practiced military rifle shooting with our athletes and shared his rich experience.  N.A. Kalinichenko, a Meritorious Athlete of the Soviet Union, shared his shooting experience with our athletes and helped them watch targets, correct their postures, and demonstrate.  O.M. Zhgutov, a Meritorious Athlete of the Soviet Union, specially developed a pistol shooting plan. When we encountered difficulties in repairing firearms, the comrade armorers of the Soviet shooting delegation helped us meticulously. When athletes from various brotherly countries met our athletes, they always gave them extremely enthusiastic encouragement. These forces have significantly improved the shooting performance of Chinese athletes, and there have been gratifying performances in the competition: the shooting performance of the military rifle ranked second; the shooting performance of the women's 50-meter and 100-meter small-bore rifle prone shooting ranked third; the women's 50-meter small-bore rifle kneeling and standing shooting also ranked third. Female athlete Li Suping, who was specially congratulated, won the championship for her individual score in the women's 50-meter small-bore rifle standing shooting event. When she returned to the team from the award platform, holding bouquets of flowers presented by athletes from various brotherly countries, the cheers were endless.
    Our athletes learned a lot of valuable experience in this competition, which has a great inspiring effect on promoting the development of shooting sports among our people.

　　本报记者　鉴远
    十一月二十六日上午，在北京射击场上，一面象征射击运动的美丽旗帜在中国国歌声中徐徐降落。
  “一九五五年国际友谊射击竞赛大会”宣布闭幕。十一月十七日到二十六日这十天中，各国运动员们在友谊的气氛中，倾心地交流了射击经验。
    在竞赛大会上，苏联的射击运动员们的射击特别精采。这次竞赛的全部五项项目，苏联代表队获得了四项冠军，并荣获全部项目的总冠军。来自列宁格勒的一位钳工、苏联功勋运动员布·普·佩列别林，在军用战斗步枪射击竞赛中最引人注意，他获得了个人冠军。来自莫斯科的一位教师、苏联功勋运动员奥·麦·日古托夫，他以命中全部六十靶、五百八十二环的优异成绩获得了男子自选小口径手枪人像靶二十五公尺射击的个人冠军。女运动员们特别注意苏联女运动健将兹·麦·科尔穆什金娜，她是古比雪夫市一所建筑专科学校的教师，这次女子的两个竞赛项目，她都获得了个人冠军。还有在男子小口径步枪射击竞赛中获得冠军的苏联运动健将弗·纳·尚布尔金等，都成了各兄弟国家的运动员们学习的榜样。
    罗马尼亚的运动员们在这次竞赛中获得了全部项目总分第二。刚到北京时，他们就表示要尽一切可能学习各兄弟国家代表队的射击经验。玛·多基利查获得了男子自选小口径手枪人像靶的第三名。女运动健将玛·茹维尔加努，她是女子自选小口径步枪五十公尺卧、跪、立姿竞赛的第三名。一对夫妇射手约·塞尔布和艾·塞尔布，在这次竞赛中也作了很好的表演，艾·塞尔布，是女子自选小口径步枪五十公尺立射第三名。
    带着和平歌声和友谊笑容到北京的保加利亚的射击运动员们，也获得很好的成绩。女教师、一级运动员拉·吉·瓦西列娃，这次她是女子自选小口径步枪五十公尺和一百公尺卧射的第二名。一级运动员维·维·赫里斯托夫，是冶金工厂的工人，他是男子小口径步枪五十公尺卧射第三名。托·加·科兹洛夫斯基，这次他的军用战斗步枪的射击成绩是五百零一环，比在国内的成绩高了十三环，自选小口径步枪的成绩也比在国内的成绩提高。保加利亚射击代表队，由于有这些善于学习的优秀运动员，这次竞赛得到了全部项目总分第三名。
    捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、蒙古、朝鲜等国的运动员们，在这些友谊的日子里也取得了很好的成就。捷克斯洛伐克的男子自选小口径手枪人像靶二十五公尺立姿速射竞赛代表队，用全部命中二百四十靶、二千一百九十六环的成绩，荣获亚军。观众曾经为他们的胜利特别欢呼。波兰运动健将维·萨尔维茨卡，这次女子自选小口径步枪五十公尺跪射，她是第三名。另一位女运动健将萨·玛·马尔希夫契克，小口径步枪卧射五十公尺和一百公尺卧射的成绩，比在波兰提高了十五环。朝鲜新义州铁工所的旋盘工金德径告诉中国朋友，这些日子以来，他对军用战斗步枪的射击技术提高了，在国内十发最高只有八十九环，现在达到九十六环。
    在这些友谊的日子里，我国运动员得到了苏联运动员们的极大帮助。苏联功勋运动员布·普·佩列别林，曾经和我国运动员们一起练习军用战斗步枪的射击，讲述他的丰富经验；苏联功勋运动员纳·阿·卡利尼钦科，把他的射击经验告诉了我国运动员，并帮助看靶、校正姿式，示范；苏联功勋运动员奥·麦·日古托夫，特给拟定手枪射击计划。当我们在枪械的修理中遇到困难时，苏联射击代表团的修械员同志就无微不至地帮助。各兄弟国家的运动员们，一遇到我国运动员也总给以极热情的鼓舞。这些力量促使中国运动员的射击成绩显著地得到了提高，竞赛中有了很可喜的表现：军用战斗步枪的射击成绩占了第二位；女子自选小口径步枪五十公尺和一百公尺卧射的成绩是第三名；女子自选小口径步枪五十公尺跪射和立射也得到第三位的成绩。受到特别庆贺的女运动员李素萍，她个人的自选小口径步枪五十公尺立射的成绩，荣获了冠军。当她怀抱着各兄弟国家运动员们赠送的花束从发奖台归回队伍的时候，欢呼声经久不息。
    我国运动员在这次竞赛中学习了很多宝贵的经验，这对于推动我国人民射击运动的开展，有巨大的鼓舞作用。
