Xinhua News Agency, November 5th, Tokyo Dispatch: Japanese Socialist Party Chairman Suzuki Mosaburo, Secretary-General Asanuma Inejirō, and other party leaders held an emergency meeting in Osaka on November 5th, deciding to demand that the Japanese government negotiate directly with China on the normalization of relations between the two countries, and to demand the conclusion of a Japan-China trade agreement. At the same time, they will launch mass movements to expand the scale of Japan-China trade.

The Socialist Party leaders also decided to thoroughly investigate in the upcoming extraordinary session of the Diet the Japanese government's policy of following the United States and its policy of suppressing the people. They also decided to oppose the Japanese government's forceful land surveying in Sunagawa-machi to expand the US military base and to resolutely support the struggle of the residents of Sunagawa-machi.

Suzuki Mosaburo and his party arrived in Osaka from Tokyo on November 4th to begin their national speaking tour. While on the train from Tokyo to Osaka, Suzuki Mosaburo, in a conversation with reporters, also demanded that the Japanese government accept the proposal to hold ambassador-level or higher-level talks with China to discuss restoring normal relations. He pointed out that restoring normal relations with China as soon as possible is one of the basic foreign policies of the Socialist Party. Suzuki also said that Japan-Soviet negotiations should be resolved as soon as possible in order to adjust relations between the two countries.

Suzuki also said that in order to prevent the Japanese conservative parties from privately taking over the government through a merger, the Socialist Party will submit a resolution to the extraordinary session of the Diet demanding the dissolution of the Diet. Suzuki also said after arriving in Osaka that the Socialist Party would also consider first submitting motions of no confidence against Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu and Director-General of the "Defense Agency" Shigemasa Sunada.

According to Kyodo News, the Socialist Party leaders' policy during this national speaking tour is to accuse the Japanese people: "The Hatoyama Cabinet is trying to implement a reactionary merger of conservative parties in order to more and more blatantly promote a rearmament policy, so that our country (Japan) and foreign monopoly capital can engage in weapons production, helping them pursue monopoly profits."

Xinhua News Agency, November 6th, Tokyo Dispatch: Japanese Socialist Party Chairman Suzuki Mosaburo said at a rally held in Osaka on the 5th that the Japanese Socialist Party's wish is first to get rid of foreign control, achieve independence, and restore Japan's autonomy.

This rally, attended by 4,000 listeners, was the first major rally held after the merger of the left and right wings of the Japanese Socialist Party, and it was also the first speech given by the leaders of the Japanese Socialist Party to begin their national speaking tour.

Suzuki Mosaburo pointed out that at present, Japan is politically and economically controlled by foreign countries, and even incidents of ancestral lands being requisitioned have occurred. This is a national tragedy. Suzuki expressed opposition to Japan acting according to the wishes of the United States in diplomacy, and expressed his support for implementing peaceful diplomacy and establishing diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China.

Japanese Socialist Party Secretary-General Asanuma Inejirō expressed opposition to the stationing of US troops in Japan. He said that if US troops continue to stay in Japan, Japan will become a "thoroughly dependent country."

Other leaders of the Japanese Socialist Party also spoke at the rally.

    日本社会党要求日本政府直接和中国谈判
    日本社会党主席主张日本摆脱外国的控制恢复自主
    新华社五日讯  东京消息：日本社会党主席铃木茂三郎、总书记浅沼稻次郎和党的其他领导干部，十一月五日在大阪举行了紧急会议，决定要求日本政府同中国直接谈判两国邦交正常化的问题，并且要求缔结日中贸易协定。同时，要展开群众运动，以扩大日中贸易的规模。
    社会党的领袖们还决定要在国会临时会议上彻底追究日本政府追随美国的政策和镇压人民的政策。他们并且决定反对日本政府为了扩大美军基地在砂川町强行测量土地，坚决支持砂川町居民的斗争。
    铃木茂三郎等一行是在十一月四日从东京到达大阪，开始他们的全国旅行演说的。铃木茂三郎在从东京到大阪的火车上向新闻记者发表谈话时，还要求日本政府接受和中国举行大使级或者更高级的会谈来讨论恢复正常关系的问题的建议。他指出，及早和中国恢复正常关系是社会党的基本外交政策之一。铃木又说，日苏谈判应当早日得到解决，以便调整两国邦交。
    铃木又说，为了阻止日本保守党派通过合并私自授受政权，社会党将向国会临时会议提出要求解散国会的决议案。铃木在到达大阪后又说，社会党也要考虑首先对外务相重光葵和“防卫厅”长官砂田重政两人提出不信任案。
    据共同社报道，社会党领袖在这次全国旅行演说中的方针是：向日本国民控诉：“鸠山内阁正想实行反动性质的保守党派合并，以便愈来愈露骨地推行重整军备政策，使我国（日本）和外国的垄断资本从事武器生产，帮助它们追求垄断利润”。
    新华社六日讯  东京消息：日本社会党主席铃木茂三郎五日在大阪举行的演说会上说，日本社会党的愿望首先是摆脱外国的控制，获得独立，恢复日本的自主性。
    这次有四千名听众参加的演说会是日本左右两派社会党合并后所举行的第一次大演说会，也是日本社会党领袖开始全国旅行演说的第一次演说。
    铃木茂三郎指出，目前，日本无论在政治上还是经济上都受到外国的控制，甚至发生祖辈传来的土地都被征用的事件。这是一个民族的悲剧。铃木表示反对日本在外交上看美国的脸色行事，并且表示主张实行和平外交以及同中华人民共和国建立邦交。
    日本社会党总书记浅沼稻次郎表示反对美军驻在日本。他说，如果美国军队继续留在日本的话，日本将变为一个“彻头彻尾的附属国”。
    在演说会上讲话的还有日本社会党的其他领导者。
