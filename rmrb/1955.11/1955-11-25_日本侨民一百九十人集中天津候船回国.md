In addition, four Japanese war criminals, who were handed over to the relevant departments of the Chinese government by the Mongolian People's Republic and whose repatriation was entrusted to the Chinese Red Cross Society by the relevant departments of the Chinese government, also arrived in Tianjin a few days ago to await their ship home.

The repatriating Japanese nationals come from more than ten provinces and cities in China, including Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Fujian, Guangdong, and Shanghai. During their journey to Tianjin, they received proper care from the Chinese Red Cross Society, and travel expenses were fully provided by the Chinese Red Cross Society. Upon arrival in Tianjin, their meals and accommodation were properly arranged, and sick Japanese nationals received medical treatment. The Tianjin branch of the Chinese Red Cross Society also provided relief to some Japanese nationals experiencing financial difficulties. The Japanese nationals engaged in cultural and recreational activities in Tianjin, watched films such as "The Butterfly Lovers," and held a get-together with workers from the Tianjin Hotel. Some of the Japanese nationals also held discussions with Tetsuji Katayama, head of the visiting delegation of the Japanese National Federation for the Protection of the Constitution, who was visiting Tianjin.

The Japanese nationals expressed their gratitude to the Chinese government and the Chinese Red Cross Society for their active assistance in their repatriation.
