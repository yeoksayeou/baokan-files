Returning from a Visit to the Soviet Union
Zhang Zhizhong

In mid-July, I was assigned to accompany Vice Premier He Long abroad to attend the closing ceremony of the celebration of the 10th anniversary of the founding of People's Poland. On August 4th, we returned to Moscow from Warsaw. I was warmly received by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and subsequently accompanied by Comrades Sharikov and Yudin for sightseeing. The tour started in the afternoon of August 5th and lasted for about six weeks. The places visited were Moscow, Leningrad, Stalingrad, and a tour of the Lenin Volga-Don Canal, Rostov, and finally Novosibirsk. The objects of the visit were factories and workers' families, collective farms and farmers' families, cultural institutions, municipal construction, and places of scenic and historical interest. Finally, I was specially invited to visit the atomic energy power station, which was not on the original visiting schedule. During my visit to the Soviet Union, I deeply felt their hospitality and affection, which was so thoughtful and kind that I cannot but express my heartfelt gratitude!

During my nearly six-week visit to the Soviet Union, although it was a superficial and incomplete tour, what I saw and heard did give me an indelible and good impression. Now I summarize it into the following points for a brief explanation, which may give everyone a picture of the great Soviet Union.

I.
The Soviet society is a highly organized and orderly society, where people fully show a harmonious and loving relationship. Let's take a look at Moscow. People walk shoulder to shoulder on the sidewalks all day long, and cross the road in groups. There are so many people and so many cars. Wen Ning, counselor of our embassy in the Soviet Union, told me that although there are many people and cars, no car has ever hit a person or caused an accident. I asked Comrade Sharikov, who accompanied me on the visit, "How many cars are there in Moscow?" He only said a lot at the time, without knowing the number, and told me the next day: "There are 500,000 cars." The people visiting the Kremlin lined up so long that it is said that there is an average of 20,000 people every day. Many stores require queuing to buy things, and public places such as theaters and cinemas also require queuing to buy tickets. Despite this, everything is very orderly, people go in and out in single file, without any scrambling. Old people and women are always given priority and seats are offered everywhere. I visited museums many times, and there were many visitors. The narrator often pulled the audience in front of him away and said, "Let the guests see!" The audience politely stepped aside. Their sense of order, discipline, and harmonious relationship between people can be seen everywhere. We have not seen such chaotic phenomena as drunkenness, quarrels, and assaults in capitalist countries in the Soviet Union. Yes, Soviet society is a socialist society!

II.
The Soviet Union is not only a land of labor, but also a paradise on earth. Judging from the daily life of the Soviet people, they have two prominent characteristics: labor and happiness. There are no unemployed people in the Soviet Union, and no one is idle. Whether in cities, factories, farms, offices, schools, or families, in any corner, everyone is working hard and seriously. But when it comes to rest, they are enjoying themselves to the fullest. Whether on the streets, parks, theaters, cinemas, scenic spots, or any public place, it is full of people. Even housewives who do not work outside are busy all day taking care of housework, taking care of children, even mopping the floor, wiping windows, tidying up the room, and arranging the home neatly and comfortably. They also go to the street to buy groceries, preparing to have a delicious dinner with their husbands. In the evening, they dress up beautifully and stroll hand in hand with their husbands, or go to the theater, or listen to music to recover from the fatigue of the day. We see that the expressions of the Soviet people are lively and cheerful, and they are living a happy life of labor and happiness without any worries.

III.
Soviet industry is highly modernized, and workers live very well. In terms of industry, I visited many factories, all of which are automated. For example, the Stalin Automobile Factory in Moscow, the Tractor Factory in Stalingrad, and the Heavy Machine Tool and Hydraulic Press Factory in Novosibirsk, from the entry of raw materials to the output of finished products, are all equipped with new automated equipment. Its efficiency is much higher than that of the old equipment, it uses fewer people, and the heavy labor of the workers is greatly reduced. I am a layman in industry, just watching the excitement and listening to their introductions. The development speed of Soviet industry is very fast. For example, the director of the Heavy Machine Tool and Hydraulic Press Factory in Novosibirsk told me: "If we take 1950 as 100, the production of our factory has increased to 700 to 900 by 1954." That is, the production has increased six to eight times. This is not an isolated case, and factories across the country can overfulfill their tasks and are developing at the fastest speed. What about the lives of the workers? This is what I am most interested in. In every factory, there are complete welfare facilities, such as cultural palaces, stadiums, hospitals, and nurseries. The cultural palace has theaters, dance halls, and sculpture rooms, painting rooms, music rooms, libraries, etc. I saw an oil painting by a worker entitled "The Great Meeting," which depicts the meeting of Stalin and Mao Zedong. This painting also won an award when it was exhibited in Moscow. There are regular performances in the theater, with as many as 18 organized by workers every month. There are movies every day, there is a dance party every Saturday, and national troupes often come to perform in the factories. I also looked at a factory nursery, which was very interesting. A part of it accommodates children from three to six months old, and those special equipment are very interesting. It is said that the government spends 300 rubles per month on each child, while the child's mother only needs to pay 15 to 60 rubles per month according to her salary level. I saw a lot of workers' residences, which are very good. They are all exquisite buildings, ranging from four or five stories to more than a dozen stories, with two to three or four rooms in each house, including bedrooms, kitchens, and bathrooms. The bathroom has a shower and a flush toilet. The bedroom has a steel wire bed with a clean white bedspread. There are also table cloths, carpets, window screens, and floral decorations. The kitchen is very clean, burns gas, and the stove is covered with a white cloth. If I hadn't seen the hanging tableware, I wouldn't have known this was the kitchen. Every family has a radio, some have cameras, and some even have televisions and sewing machines. There are many oil paintings and various artworks hanging on the walls. Children all have strollers. I visited a worker's residence at the Stalingrad Tractor Factory and saw a new car parked downstairs. The factory director said that this was a prize awarded to the worker by the factory. This year, 28 people won the Victory brand car, and 56 people won another brand of small car. During holidays, they take their families out for a drive. People who were with me said that we have already seen the prosperous and happy socialist worker's life today, and it will be even better when we get to communism!

IV.
Soviet agriculture is completely collectivized and mechanized, and farmers live very well. I visited many collective farms and state-owned farms, such as the Molotov Collective Farm in Moscow, the Stalin Collective Farm in Stalingrad, and the Malenkov Collective Farm in Novosibirsk. The scale is very large and the land is abundant. Like the Stalin Collective Farm, it was completely destroyed in the war and rebuilt after the war. It is responsible for supplying the people of Stalingrad with grain, milk, meat, and vegetables. This farm has 23,000 hectares of land (one hectare equals 15 Chinese mu), is 50 kilometers long, and has a population of 321 households, 1,262 people, and 613 laborers, with an average of more than 1,000 mu per household and more than 500 mu per laborer. However, of the more than 300,000 mu of land, only more than 120,000 mu are planted with grain, and the rest are forest land, pasture, and marshland. With so much land, it is impossible not to adopt a high degree of mechanization. This farm has 35 tractors and 17 combine harvesters working. Each farm has two agronomists and two animal husbandry experts. Their salaries are paid by the government, and the farm only gives them bonuses. In many collective farms, sideline income is more than grain income, at least equal. For example, the Malenkov Collective Farm has 385 households, 2,000 people, 530 laborers, and owns 12,800 hectares of land, 1,000 cattle (including 400 dairy cows, with an average annual milk yield of 2,500 liters per cow), which are raised in ten cattle farms. The cattle farms are all reinforced concrete buildings with windows on both sides and a pedestrian walkway in the middle, which is very clean. It also raises 7,000 chickens and more than 300 boxes of bees. It owns 13 trucks. It already has a seven-year school and is now starting to convert it into a ten-year school. All farmers in each collective farm have received at least four years of education, and most of them have graduated from seven-year schools.

I also paid close attention to the lives of the farmers. The farmer's family is roughly similar to that of the worker's. The interior furnishings are also similar. The only difference is that workers live in apartment-style high-rise buildings, while farmers live in wooden bungalows. The surroundings of the house are divided into several mu of private land, which can be used to grow vegetables, raise pigs, raise chickens, and raise cattle as their own income. The lives of the farmers are affluent. The annual income of each medium-sized laborer is generally 22,000 rubles (equivalent to 11,000 yuan), of which 14,000 rubles are distributed from the collective of the farm, and another 8,000 are the income from their own private land. I once asked the chairman of a certain farm (the chairman is divorced from production), and he said that his annual income is 27,000 rubles, which is a little more than that of a medium-sized laborer. Farmers eat milk, meat, and vegetables every day. Although the lives of the farmers are so good, when I talked to them, they all said that this is not enough. They want to increase production and create more wealth to meet the growing needs of the people. 5. The Soviet people have special respect and admiration for revolutionary leaders and historical figures. The names of Soviet revolutionary leaders and historical figures are used as the names of many cities. Soviet friends calculated dozens of them. Like Leningrad, Stalingrad, Voroshilovgrad, Kirov, Kaliningrad, Molotov, Zhdanov, Gorky, Sverdlovsk, Dzerzhinsk, Ordzhonikidze,... As for factories, farms, museums, and city streets named after revolutionary leaders and historical figures, it is even more common and countless. Memorial bronze statues are everywhere. For example, in Moscow, there are bronze statues of Lenin, Stalin, Kirov, Dzerzhinsky, Pushkin, Gogol, Gorky, Baomilyantiev, Lomonosov, Tchaikovsky, and Prince Dolgoruky, the founder of Moscow... and there are many more. The Soviet Union has the most places to commemorate Lenin and Stalin. In Moscow, Lenin's office, conference hall, restaurant, bedroom, and library in the Kremlin are all displayed as Lenin presented them during his lifetime and are properly protected. The villa where Lenin lived in the suburbs of Moscow is also open for people to visit. A bronze statue was erected at the place where Lenin was assassinated in 1918. The place where Lenin took refuge in a shed in Leningrad is now a memorial hall and a monument. The Lenin Museum in Moscow is large in scale and rich in materials. I spent four hours just taking a quick look. The Stalin Museum is under construction. The Lenin Stalin Mausoleum on Red Square in Moscow is open four times a week, and the line of people who come to pay their respects is very, very long. Even the place where Pushkin was injured in a duel was also built with a monument. His home has also been turned into a museum for people to visit. The Soviet Union's practice of revering revolutionary leaders and historical figures has great political and educational significance for the people, and it is also very good.

VI.
The Soviet people love literature and art and have a high level of cultural accomplishment. We have been to many workers' and farmers' families, and there are many books on the bookshelves, and it is said that literary novels are the most numerous. The translated versions of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong have been published in four volumes. The works of Guo Moruo, Mao Dun, Ding Ling, Zhao Shuli, and others have also been translated a lot. Our classic masterpieces, such as Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Water Margin, Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio, and even Qu Yuan's Li Sao, etc., all have translated versions. It is said that they sell very well, and each translated version is sold out in two hours. Our Yue Opera Troupe, which went abroad, staged "Romance of the West Chamber" in Moscow. I was worried that the language was not understood and the characters were simple (there were only three people singing back and forth, which was too far from the dozens or even hundreds of people who went on stage in Soviet operas), so that the Soviet people could not be interested. That night, I went to see the audience's reaction, but I knew that the play was very popular with the Soviet people, and they were concentrating on watching it from beginning to end. According to the audience's feedback, they believed that the expressions, techniques, movements, costumes, scenery, and music of the Yue Opera all reached a high level of artistry, and they were greatly praised in the newspapers. There are very many various types of museums, all with rich content and beautiful layout, and there are so many visitors. We visited the Revolution Museum, which was like reading a history of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. After visiting the Red Army Museum, it was like reading a history of the development of the Red Army. Smirnov, Chairman of the Leningrad City Soviet, told me that Leningrad has 44 institutions of higher learning, 97 scientific research institutions, more than 170 libraries, 47 various museums, 54 cinemas, and many theaters and concert halls. He also said that this is not enough. For example, the Peter Winter Palace (famous for its art gallery) is very large, and it is not easy to see it all in a few days. The Peter Summer Palace (famous for its fountains) is dozens of kilometers away from Leningrad, and there are often so many visitors. According to the manager, the statistics for the past three months show that 500,000 people have come. In Leningrad, I saw the bronze statue of Peter the Great. Peter was a relatively progressive emperor at that time, and he played a role in the strength of Russia at that time, so it is still possible to keep his bronze statue; but I also saw the bronze statue of Nicholas I, who was the most reactionary and tyrannical monarch hated by the people, and the bronze statue was also kept. I asked them why. They said that it was specially preserved as a beautiful work of art. For example, the Aurora battleship, which fired the first shot at the Winter Palace during the October Revolution - this is the first shot to create a better future for mankind! - is now a museum, displaying all historical relics, including Lenin's order to attack, for people to visit. When we visited, the curator (who was the political commissar of this battleship at the time) explained to us in detail, and gave me a signed photo of the battleship before leaving, which was very kind. The Soviet Union's fine arts, music, dance, drama, and film (now there are wide-screen films and the development of 3D films) are progressing so fast, and there are so many equipment and creations! Everyone loves art, and the atmosphere is full of art everywhere. How lovely is the Soviet Union! How lovely are the Soviet people with artistic accomplishment!

VII.
The Soviet people universally love sports and pay attention to physical exercise. The Soviet people are all physically strong. A good life and good nutrition are one reason, but paying attention to physical exercise is especially important. When I was in Moscow, I watched two football matches, one between the Soviet Union and England, and one between the Soviet Union and West Germany. The English team is famous, and the West German football team is the recent international champion, but they both lost to the Soviet Union. The former was three to zero, and the latter was three to two. The game was really wonderful, and the audience's emotions were tense and enthusiastic. This was a tense competition situation that I had rarely encountered in my life. In Leningrad, I saw many men and women learning to row, and they were very interested. The people who coached were also serious in their guidance. There are the most stadiums in Soviet cities, and factories have their own stadiums. A large stadium is being newly built at the foot of Lenin Hills in Moscow, covering an area of 165 hectares. This venue has stands that can accommodate 100,000 spectators, an outdoor swimming pool that can accommodate 15,000 people, an indoor swimming pool that can accommodate 1,700 people, a playground that can accommodate 1,700 people, and eight football fields, 125 basketball courts, 125 volleyball courts, and many tennis courts. In addition to ground roads, there are also six underground tram tracks.

When we talk about the physical strength of the Soviet people, we can't help but think that the physical standards of our Chinese people are a little worse. For example, our male and female students studying in the Soviet Union are generally good at their studies and can keep up with the Soviet students, but in terms of physical fitness, in contrast, they feel insufficient. I met many Chinese students in Moscow and other places, and I told them all that Chairman Mao instructed you to be "three good"? Now you only need to be good in body and good in learning, and you should pay attention to doing it, especially paying attention to being good in body is the most important. They all agreed, "Yes." Yuan Zhaoding, a graduate student at Moscow University, also said that he would definitely convey this meaning to his classmates.

VIII.
The high development of Soviet science and technology has surpassed any capitalist country. This can be proved by the atomic energy power station. The Soviet Union's atomic energy power station is only 5,000 kilowatts, and now it is working on building 50,000 and 100,000 kilowatts. When I visited, I asked the stationmaster, Dr. Krachen: "With atomic energy power generation, can it replace hydropower and thermal power generation?" He replied: "No. In the future, the power needed by mankind will be very large. It is estimated that the existing power only accounts for 35 percent of the total power needed by mankind, and the remaining 65 percent will rely on atomic energy and other aspects. However, atomic energy power generation will be important because it is several times cheaper than other power sources." This is the great contribution of science to human happiness.

National electrification is the long-term goal of the Soviet people. Lenin had already instructed: "Communism is the Soviet regime plus national electrification." Now hydropower is being developed all over the country. We saw the Stalingrad Hydropower Station project, which is said to be building a Stalin Sea, which is 30 kilometers wide, 600 kilometers long, and several to dozens of meters deep. But when I visited the Ob River Hydropower Station in Novosibirsk, according to the engineers, they are now designing a project to build a 5 million kilowatt power plant on the Ob River, which is more than twice the power generation of the Stalingrad Power Station. Some places in the Soviet Union have already achieved electrification. I also visited the All-Soviet Agricultural Exhibition, Moscow University, Leningrad Observatory (known as the world's astronomical capital), and Stalingrad Observatory, all of which are large in scale and fully equipped, which also shows the high development of science and technology. As for the Soviet Arctic floating ice science station, it has carried out research on Arctic climate and ocean science. It is also planning to create artificial satellites, which will further explore the mysteries of the universe. The great contribution and function of science to mankind is consistently valued by the leaders of the Soviet Party and government and the people. Soviet scientists are working tirelessly to research, invent, and create.

IX.
The Soviet people have a high degree of internationalist spirit. Their respect for our country's position and their infinite confidence in our country's construction prospects, as well as their kind enthusiasm for us, can be seen anytime and anywhere. When I visited Lenin's refuge in Leningrad, I was surrounded by a large group of people as soon as I came out, and they invited me to their homes. Originally, there was not enough time, and I didn't want to delay any longer, but one of the old ladies was very sincere and insisted on inviting me to sit down. When I arrived at her home, she asked me to eat fruit, and before leaving, she personally picked a lot of fresh flowers to give me. When visiting the Stalin Collective Farm from one family to another, I was stopped by another old lady, who insisted that I go to her home to see it. When I arrived at her home, she took out the photo album for me to see, and casually wrote a note on the photo of her son, who is now a Red Army lieutenant, and said that she would give it to me as a souvenir. How enthusiastic this is! After visiting the Malenkov Collective Farm in Novosibirsk, the chairman of the farm took us to a farmer's house, where a long table was set with dishes, including two roast suckling pigs, chicken, fish, and various wines. The food and wine were so rich that we had to eat some even if we couldn't eat it. The housewives also raised their glasses to toast. How hospitable they are! We met many interns who were sent to Soviet factories to practice, and they all said that Soviet friends taught everything without reservation, sincerely and seriously. The lives of the interns are also taken care of with kindness. During the two days and two nights on the ship passing through the Lenin Volga-Don Canal to Rostov, Dr. Ren Weinong, who was traveling with us, was surrounded by many innocent and lively female students. They talked in simple German and English, and they talked so intimately that they left each other's mailing addresses before parting. In Moscow, I talked to Comrade Golkin, Deputy Secretary of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, three times. When I talked about the great achievements of the Soviet Union's industrial and agricultural construction and the backward state of China's industry and agriculture, Comrade Golkin said: "China is a great country. The workers have good intelligence, strong labor force, good labor discipline, and high production morale. Chinese farmers are very diligent, thrifty, and brave. China has many superior conditions and will definitely catch up with the Soviet Union. The Soviet people are proud and proud to have such a great brotherly country." Comrade Golkin's words are true. Wherever we went, when we talked to some responsible comrades of the Party and government, such as the chairman of the city soviet, we heard the same words and all revealed the same feelings for China. This not only shows the high degree of internationalist spirit of the Soviet people, but also fully demonstrates the unbreakable fraternal eternal friendship and spirit of unity and cooperation between the two major countries of China and the Soviet Union.

X.
The Soviet Union's peaceful diplomatic policy is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people and has the firm support of the people across the country. The people we came into contact with all generally expressed their aversion to war and opposition to war; at the same time, they also expressed that the Soviet Union has become incomparably strong, and the world's peace forces are also growing day by day. If the imperialists dare to launch a war of aggression, they are not afraid and will definitely give them a devastating blow. When I was walking in the park, I met an old woman, 75 years old, whose two sons were sacrificed in the Great Patriotic War, leaving only one daughter. When she talked to me about Hitler, she gritted her teeth and expressed her great hatred. In Leningrad, I also met an old worker named Yemilyanov, 84 years old. He himself had covered Lenin to take refuge. He had five sons, four of whom were sacrificed in the Great Patriotic War, leaving one son and two daughters. During World War II, the Soviet people made the greatest sacrifices, so their aversion to war and opposition to war is completely understandable. At the same time, they understand more clearly that today's beautiful life is due to peaceful construction. They must oppose war and stop aggression so that a better life can be maintained and continue to develop. Therefore, regardless of men, women, old or young, they all express their heartfelt support for the peaceful diplomatic policy of the Party and the government.

In recent years, the Communist Party and the government of the Soviet Union have taken a series of measures that have played a significant role in easing international tensions and safeguarding world peace, and this role is still expanding. Now, there are many groups or individuals visiting the Soviet Union, especially from capitalist countries, including government, parliament, economic, cultural, social, and various other types, coming in an endless stream. This can increase their understanding of the Soviet Union, which will also help international trust and peace. Of course, the Soviet Union's peaceful diplomatic policy is not only firmly supported by the people across the country, but also represents the common aspiration of the people all over the world!

XI.
The correct and strong leadership of the Communist Party and the government of the Soviet Union and the spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people have been sincerely supported by the people of all ethnic groups in the Soviet Union. On August 4, at the third meeting of the fourth session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Comrade Begov, Secretary of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, invited me to attend as an observer. I heard Bulganin's report on the results of the Geneva Four-Power Summit, and I saw all the representatives applauding him enthusiastically to express their support. Representatives made speeches expressing their firm approval of the measures taken by the government at the Geneva Four-Power Summit. Wherever I went, when I talked to the chairman or vice-chairman of the Soviet, they all said: Our work is always not enough, and we cannot fully meet the growing material and cultural needs of the people, such as insufficient housing, insufficient hospitals, insufficient schools, and insufficient cultural facilities. Their work is so serious, the leadership is strong, the efficiency is high, and the attitude is so modest, of course, they have won the sincere trust and love of the people. When I talked to workers and farmers, they all expressed their unanimous belief in the Communist Party and the government of the Soviet Union, and they all unanimously expressed their confidence that as long as they followed the Party and the government, they would definitely reach a communist society; but they also said that we must continue to work hard, increase production, and create more wealth for the country in order to reach the ultimate great goal.

Twenty-eight years ago, I traveled all over Europe and the United States, and today's visit to the Soviet Union has given me a very deep impression. Progress and regression, newborn and decadent, light and darkness, are easy to distinguish. What I have gained from my visit to the Soviet Union naturally evokes a feeling about my own motherland, that is, the path of Marxism-Leninism that our Chinese people are taking under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao is completely correct. We will inevitably move from victory to greater victory, leading the country to a state of prosperity, prosperity, and happiness, and gradually enter a great socialist-communist society!

    访苏归来
    张治中
    我在七月中旬奉派随同贺龙副总理出国，参加人民波兰成立十周年纪念年闭幕典礼，我们在八月四日从华沙回到莫斯科，我就被苏联最高苏维埃主席团殷勤接待，并承先后派沙里可夫同志和尤金同志陪同参观。从八月五日午后开始参观，前后约六个星期。参观的地方是：莫斯科、列宁格勒、斯大林格勒，游览了列宁伏尔加河—顿河运河，到了罗斯托夫，最后到新西伯利亚。参观的对象是：工厂和工人家庭、集体农庄和农民家庭、文化机构、市政建设和名胜古迹。最后特别被邀请参观了原子能发电站，这是在参观计划之外的。我在苏联参观期间，深深感觉到他们的招待和情意，一切周到而亲切之至，我不能不表示衷心的感谢！
    在苏联将近六星期的参观中，虽然是走马看花，不深入，不全面，但所见所闻，确已给我以不可磨灭的良好印象。现在我归纳为以下几点加以扼要说明，或者可以给大家描画一个伟大的苏联的轮廓。
    一
    苏联社会是一个极有组织有秩序的社会，人与人相互间充分表现出和谐友爱的关系。我们且看看莫斯科吧。人行道上一天到晚肩并肩在走，过马路也是成群地走，人多极了，汽车也多极了。我国驻苏大使馆温宁参赞对我说，虽然人多，汽车也多，汽车就不曾撞过人出过事故。我问陪同我参观的沙里可夫同志：“莫斯科有多少汽车？”他当时只说很多，不知道数目，第二天才告诉我：“有五十万辆。”参观克里姆林宫的人排队排得那样长，据说每天平均有二万人。很多商店买东西都要排队，剧场、影院等公共地方买票也要排队。尽管是这样，但都非常有秩序，鱼贯地进出，没有一点争先恐后的情形。老年人和妇女到处都被让先让座位。我多次参观博物馆，看的人很多，讲解员常把围在前面的观众拉开说：“让客人看！”观众就很有礼貌地让开。他们那种守秩序、有纪律和人与人间的和谐关系，到处都看得出来。我们在苏联就没有看见过像在资本主义国家内那种醉酒、争吵、行凶等混乱的现象。是的，苏联社会是社会主义的社会啊！
    二
    苏联不仅是劳动的国度，也是人间的乐园。我们从苏联人的日常生活看，他们有两个突出的特点，就是劳动与快乐。苏联没有失业的人，没有不劳动的人。无论在城市、在工厂、在农庄、在机关、在学校、在家庭，在任何一个角落，个个人都在紧张、严肃地工作。但是一到休息的时候，他们又是尽情地快乐。无论在街上、公园、剧场、影院、名胜，以及任何公共的地方，到处都充满了人流。就是不在外工作的家庭主妇，也是整天忙碌地料理家务，照料孩子，乃至抹地板，擦窗户，收拾房间，把家庭布置得整洁而舒适。还要上街买菜，预备和丈夫共进美味的晚餐。到了晚上，就打扮得漂漂亮亮和丈夫手携着手去散步，或去看戏，或去听音乐，来恢复一天的疲劳。我们看到苏联人民的表情都是活泼的、愉快的，都是无忧无虑地过着劳动与快乐的幸福生活。
    三
    苏联工业高度现代化，工人生活很好。在工业方面，我参观了许多工厂，都是自动化的。像我参观的莫斯科的斯大林汽车工厂、斯大林格勒的拖拉机工厂、新西伯利亚的重型机床与水压机厂等等，从原料进去以至成品出来，都是新式的自动的装备。它的效率比旧式装备提高很多，用的人也较少，工人的沉重的劳动也大大减少。我对工业是外行，只是看看热闹，听听他们介绍而已。苏联工业的发展速度很快。譬如在新西伯利亚的重型机床与水压机厂厂长告诉我：“我们厂的生产，如以一九五○年作为一百，到一九五四年已增到七百至九百。”就是增产六倍至八倍。这不是个别的，全国工厂都能超额完成任务，都是以最大的速度在发展。工人的生活怎样？这是我最感兴趣的。在每个工厂里，都有完备的福利设备，像文化宫、体育场、医院、托儿所等。文化宫里有剧场、舞厅，还有雕刻室、绘画室、音乐室、图书馆等等。我看到一个工人画的题为“伟大的会见”的油画，它描绘了斯大林、毛泽东的会见，这幅画在莫斯科展览时还得了奖。剧场经常有演出，工人自动组织的每月多至十八次，每天有电影，星期六一定有舞会，国家的剧团也常到各厂演出。我又看了一个工厂托儿所，很有趣，有一部分收容三个月到六个月的孩子，那些特别设备很有意思。据说公家每月用在每个孩子身上的是三百卢布，而孩子的母亲按工资等级每月只要缴纳十五至六十个卢布。我看了很多工人住宅，好得很。都是考究的大楼，每栋四、五层至十几层不等，每家两间至三、四间不等，寝室、厨房、卫生间都有。卫生间有淋浴，有抽水马桶。寝室有钢丝床，床上有洁白的床罩。还有棹布、地毯、窗纱、花草陈设。厨房很清洁，烧的是瓦斯，灶上盖了白布，要不是看到挂的餐具，还不知道这就是厨房呢。家家有收音机，有的有照相机，有的还有电视机、缝纫机。墙上挂了不少油画和各种美术品。有小孩的都有小罗车。我在斯大林格勒拖拉机厂访问工人住宅，看到楼下停了一辆新轿车。厂长说，这是工厂奖给工人的。今年得奖胜利牌汽车的有二十八人，得奖另一种牌子小型汽车的有五十六人。他们在星期假日，就带了一家人坐车出去游玩。我们同行的人都说，我们今天看到繁荣、幸福的社会主义的工人生活已经这样，将来到共产主义还要更好哩！

    苏联农业完全集体化、机械化，农民生活很好。我参观了许多集体农庄和国营农场，如莫斯科的莫洛托夫集体农庄，斯大林格勒的斯大林集体农庄，新西伯利亚的马林科夫集体农庄等，规模很大，土地很多。像斯大林集体农庄，在战争中全毁了，是战后重建家园的，它负有供应斯大林格勒市人民的粮食、牛乳、肉类、菜蔬的责任。这个农庄，有二万三千公顷土地（一公顷合华亩十五亩），长五十公里，人口是三百二十一户，一千二百六十二人，劳动力六百十三人，平均每户一千多亩，每劳动力占五百多亩。不过三十多万亩土地中，种粮食的只有十二万多亩，其余的是林地、牧场和湖沼地带。土地如此多，不采用高度机械化是不行的，这农庄就有拖拉机三十五部，联合收割机十七部在工作。每个农庄都有两位农学家和两位畜牧专家，他们待遇由政府开支，农庄只给他们的奖励。在好些集体农庄里，副业收入比粮食收入多，最少也相等。又如马林科夫集体农庄，有三百八十五户，两千人，劳动力五百三十人，拥有一万二千八百公顷土地，一千头牛（内乳牛四百头，每牛平均年出牛乳二千五百公升），分养在十个牛场。牛场全是钢筋混凝土建筑，两面窗户，中间行人道，很干净。另养鸡七千只，蜜蜂三百多箱。拥有载重汽车十三部。已有七年制学校一所，现正着手改为十年制。各农庄庄员最少受过四年制教育，一般的都在七年制学校毕业。
    我也很注意庄员们的生活。农民家庭和工人的大致相仿佛。室内陈设也差不多。所不同的，只是工人住的是公寓式的高大楼房，而农民则每家住一栋木造平房。房的周围分有私有地几亩，可以种菜、养猪、养鸡、养牛，作为自家收入。农民的生活是富裕的，每一个中等劳动力每年收入一般有二万二千卢布（合人民币一万一千元），其中一万四千卢布是从农庄的集体分得，另八千是自家私地的收益。我曾问某农庄主席（主席都脱离生产），他说他年入二万七千卢布，比一个中等劳动力多一些。农民们每天吃的是牛奶、肉类和菜蔬。农民生活虽是这样好，但我和他们谈话时，他们都说这是不够的，还要增加生产，创造更多的财富，才能满足人民日益增长的种种需要。五苏联人民对革命领袖和历史名人特别推崇尊敬。苏联的革命领袖、历史名人的名字作为城市的名字的很多，苏联朋友一算就算出几十个。像列宁格勒、斯大林格勒、伏罗希洛夫格勒、基洛夫、加里宁格勒、莫洛托夫、日丹诺夫、高尔基、斯维德洛夫斯克、捷尔任斯克、奥尔忠尼启则，……至于工厂、农庄、博物馆和城市街道以革命领袖、历史名人的名字命名的更普遍，数不胜数。纪念铜像到处都是。如在莫斯科，就有列宁、斯大林、基洛夫、捷尔任斯基、普希金、果戈理、高尔基、保米良捷夫、罗蒙诺索夫、柴可夫斯基、莫斯科创基人多尔果洛基公爵等人的铜像……还多得很。苏联纪念列宁、斯大林的地方最多。在莫斯科，列宁在克里姆林宫的办公室、会议厅、餐厅、寝室、图书室，都照列宁生前陈列，妥为保护。列宁在莫斯科近郊住过的别墅，也开放任人瞻谒。一九一八年列宁被刺的地方，树立了一个铜像。列宁在列宁格勒避难时所住的草棚的地方，现在也盖了纪念馆，并建有纪念碑。莫斯科的列宁博物馆，规模宏大，资料丰富，我花了四个钟头，还只是匆匆地看了一下。斯大林博物馆正在修建中。莫斯科红场的列宁斯大林墓，每周开放四次，每次瞻谒的人排队很长很长。即如普希金决斗受伤的地方，也建了纪念碑。他的家也改成博物馆，任人参观。苏联这种崇敬革命领袖和历史名人的作法，对人民的政治意义和教育意义是很大的，也是很好的。

    苏联人民爱好文学艺术，具有高度的文化素养。我们到过许多工人农民的家庭，书架上都摆了很多的书，据说以文艺小说为最多。毛泽东选集译文已经出了四本。郭沫若、茅盾、丁玲、赵树理等人的著作，翻译的也多。我们的古典名著，如三国演义、水浒传、聊斋，乃至屈原离骚等等，都有译本。据说销路都很好，每种译本一出，两个钟头就卖完了。我们出国的越剧团在莫斯科上演“西厢记”，我担心言语不通，人物简单（唱来唱去只有三个人，和苏联的歌剧一上台就几十人乃至上百人相去太远），不能使苏联人感到兴趣。那晚我为了看一看观众的反应情况也去了，那知道这个剧大受苏联人的欢迎，他们自始到终聚精会神地在欣赏。据观众反映，认为越剧的表情、手法、身段、服装、布景、音乐，都达到高度的艺术水平，在报章上大加赞美。各种各类的博物馆非常多，都是内容丰富，布置美观，参观的人就有那么多。我们看了革命博物馆，就如同读了联共党史一遍。看了红军博物馆，就如同读了红军发展史一遍。列宁格勒市苏维埃主席斯米尔诺夫告诉我，列宁格勒有高等学校四十四所、科学研究机关九十七个，图书馆一百七十多个，各种博物馆四十七个，电影院五十四个，剧院音乐厅也很多。他还说，这是不够的。又如彼得冬宫（以画廊著名）很大，几天都不容易看完。彼得夏宫（以喷泉著名），离列宁格勒几十公里，参观的人都经常那么多。据管理人说，最近三个月的统计，就已有五十万人来过。在列宁格勒，我看到彼得大帝的铜像。彼得在当时是个比较具有进步思想的皇帝，对当时俄国的强盛是起了作用，保留他的铜像还有可说；但我又看到尼古拉一世的铜像，他是人民所痛恨的最反动的暴虐的君主，铜像也保留了。我问他们为什么。他们说是把它作为一件美的艺术品而特予保留的。又如十月革命时向冬宫开第一炮——这是创造人类美好前途的第一炮啊！——的阿芙乐尔号兵舰，现在成为一个博物馆，把所有历史文物包括列宁所下进攻的命令在内，一一陈列，任人参观。我们参观时，馆长（就是当时这只兵舰上的政治委员）为我们详细解释，临走还送我一张亲笔签字的兵舰照片，非常亲切。苏联的美术、音乐、舞蹈、戏剧、电影（现又有宽银幕电影、立体电影的发展）进步这样快，设备创作这样多！人人都爱好艺术，处处都充满艺术的气氛，可爱的苏联！可爱的富有艺术素养的苏联人民啊！
    七
    苏联人普遍爱好运动，注意体格锻炼。苏联人民个个体格强健，固然生活好营养好是一个原因，而注意体格锻炼尤其关系重要。我在莫斯科时看了两场足球比赛，一场苏联对英国，一场苏联对西德。英国的球队是有名的，西德足球队是最近的国际冠军，但是都败于苏联。前者是三对零，后者是三对二。比赛真精采，观众情绪也紧张而热烈，这是我生平很少遇见的这样紧张的竞赛情况。在列宁格勒，我看到许多男女在学习划船，兴趣很高，教练的人指导也认真。苏联各城市体育场最多，工厂都有自备体育场。莫斯科列宁山脚正在新修一个大体育场，占地达一六五公顷。这场内有可容纳十万观众的看台，可容一万五千人的室外游泳池一个，可容一千七百人的室内游泳池一个，可容一千七百人的游戏场一个，还有八个足球场，一百二十五个篮球场，一百二十五个排球场和许多个网球场，除地面公路外，还有六条地下电车道通行。
    我们说到苏联人民体格的强健，就不禁想到我们中国人民的体格标准就差些。譬如我们在苏联的男女留学生，一般功课都好，赶得上苏联学生，但在体格方面，相形之下，就觉得不够了。我在莫斯科和其他地方，遇见许多中国留学生，我都和他们说，毛主席不是指示你们“三好”吗？现在你们只要身体好、学习好两好，应该注意做到，特别注意身体好为最要紧。他们都连声答应“对”。在莫斯科大学的研究生袁兆鼎还说，他一定把这个意思转达给同学们。
    八
    苏联科学技术的高度发展已超过任何资本主义国家。这一点，我们从原子能发电站就可以证明。苏联这个原子能发电站只是五千瓩的，现在正从事修建五万、十万瓩的。我参观的时候曾问站长克拉琴博士：“有了原子能发电，是不是就可以代替水力和火力发电？”他答：“不是的。将来人类需要的动力很大，估计现有的动力只占人类需要动力总量的百分之三十五，其余的百分之六十五要靠原子能和其它方面。不过原子能发电将是重要的，因为它比别的动力要便宜几倍。”这就是科学对人类幸福的巨大贡献。
    全国电气化是苏联人民长期奋斗的目标。列宁早就指示过：“共产主义就是苏维埃政权加上全国电气化。”现在全国各地都在搞水力发电。我们看到斯大林格勒水电站工程，据说正在造一个斯大林海，它宽三十公里，长六百公里，深几公尺到几十公尺。但我到新西伯利亚的鄂毕河水电站参观时，据工程师说，现正设计在鄂毕河上建一发电五百万瓩的工程，大过斯大林格勒发电站的发电量两倍多。苏联有些地方已经做到电气化了。我还参观了全苏农业展览会、莫斯科大学、列宁格勒天文台（称为世界天文首府）和斯大林格勒天文台，都是规模宏大，设备完全的，这也可看出科学技术的高度发展。至于苏联的北极浮冰科学站，开展了北极气候和海洋科学的研究。又正在计划创造人造卫星，将进一步发掘宇宙的神秘。科学对人类的贡献和功用之大，实为苏联党政首长和人民所一贯重视，苏联科学家们正在孜孜不倦地研究、发明、创造着。

    苏联人民具有高度的国际主义精神，他们对我国地位的推重和对我国建设前途的无限信心，并对我们的亲切热情，是随时随地都可以看到的。我在列宁格勒参观列宁避难的地方，刚出来就被一大群人围着，邀请我到他们家里去。本来时间不够，不想再耽搁，但是其中一位老太太情意非常恳切，一定要请我去坐坐。到了她的家里，就请吃果子，临走又亲自摘了好些鲜花送我。参观斯大林集体农庄从这一家到另一家时，中间又被另一家老太太拦住，非得进她家看看不可。我到她家时，她把相片册拿给我看，顺手就把她的现任红军中尉的儿子的相片亲自题上字，说送给我作纪念。这是多么热情啊！在新西伯利亚参观马林科夫集体农庄后，农庄主席把我们带到一个庄员家里，摆了一大长桌子的菜，有两个烤乳猪，有鸡有鱼，有各种的酒，好丰盛的酒菜，吃不下也得要吃一些，主妇们还举着杯来敬酒，他们多好客呀！中国派送到苏联工厂实习的实习生我们遇见很多，他们都说，苏联朋友毫无保留地教给一切，诚挚而认真。实习生的生活也得到亲切的照顾。我们在通过列宁伏尔加河—顿河运河至罗斯托夫船上的两天两夜中，和我们同行的医生任慰农同志被同船许多天真活泼的女学生包围了，她们用简单的德文、英文交谈，谈得那么亲热，临别还互留通讯地址。在莫斯科，我和苏联最高苏维埃主席团副秘书戈尔金同志谈了三次。当我谈到苏联工农业建设的伟大成就和中国工农业的落后状况时，戈尔金同志就说：“中国是个伟大的国家，工人智慧好、劳动力强、劳动纪律好、生产情绪高；中国农民非常勤劳、俭朴、勇敢；中国具有许多优越的条件，一定会赶上苏联，苏联人民认为有这样一个伟大的兄弟国家而引为光荣与骄傲。”戈尔金同志的话是真实的。我们所到各地，和一些党政负责同志如市苏维埃主席等谈话时，都听到同样的话语，都流露出对中国同样的感情。这不但显示苏联人民的高度国际主义精神，也充分表明中苏两大国家牢不可破的兄弟般的永恒友谊与团结合作的精神。

    苏联的和平外交政策深入人心，得到全国人民的坚决拥护。我们所接触到的人，他们都普遍表示厌恶战争，反对战争；同时也表示苏联已强大无比，世界和平力量也日益壮大，如果帝国主义敢于发动侵略战争，他们并不惧怕，一定予以歼灭性的打击。我在公园散步时，碰到一位老太婆，七十五岁了，两个儿子都在卫国战争中牺牲了，剩下一个女儿，她和我谈到希特勒时，咬牙切齿地表示非常痛恨。在列宁格勒，我还遇到一位老工人，名叶密里扬洛夫，八十四岁了，他自己掩护过列宁避难，他有五个儿子，在卫国战争中牺牲了四个，剩下一个儿子和两个女儿。在二次大战中，苏联人民的牺牲最大，所以他们厌恶战争、反对战争是完全可以理解的。同时，他们更明白今天生活的美好，是由于和平建设，一定要反对战争、制止侵略，美好的生活才能保持和继续发展。所以他们无论男女老少，对党和政府的和平外交政策，都表示衷心的拥护。
    苏联共产党和政府近年来采取了一系列的措施，对缓和国际紧张局势、保障世界和平起了重大的作用，这种作用还在扩展。现在到苏联访问参观的团体或个人，特别是资本主义国家的很多，政府的、议会的、经济的、文化的、社会的，各种各样，络绎不绝。这可增加他们对苏联的了解，也就有助于国际的信任和和平。当然，苏联的和平外交政策，不但为全国人民所坚决拥护，也代表着全世界人民的共同愿望！
    十一
    苏联共产党和政府正确的、强有力的领导和全心全意为人民服务的精神得到苏联各族人民的真诚拥护。八月四日第四届苏联最高苏维埃第三次会议，苏联最高苏维埃主席团的秘书别哥夫同志请我旁听。我听到布尔加宁关于日内瓦四国政府首脑会议的结果的报告，看到全体代表对他热烈鼓掌，表示拥护。各代表发言，对政府在日内瓦四国政府首脑会议上所采取的措施，表示坚决的赞同。我所到之处，和苏维埃主席或副主席谈话，他们都说：我们的工作总是做不够，还不能完全满足人民日益增长的物质需要和文化需要，如住宅不够，医院不够，学校不够，文化设备不够等等。他们工作是那样认真，领导强、效率高，而态度又是那样谦虚，当然得到人民诚挚的信任和爱戴。我和工人、农民谈话时，他们都一致表示对苏联共产党和政府的信赖，一致表示只要跟着党和政府走就一定可以到达共产主义社会的信心；但是还说，我们还要继续努力，增加生产，为国家创造更多的财富，才能到达最终的伟大目标。
    二十八年前，我曾经遍游欧美，而今日访问苏联，给我的印象甚深。前进与后退，新生与腐朽，光明与黑暗，再容易辨别不过了。我在苏联参观所得，很自然地发生对自己祖国的一种感想，就是我们中国人民在中国共产党和毛主席领导下走的马克思列宁主义的道路是完全正确的，我们必然由胜利走向更大的胜利，致国家于富强、繁荣、幸福的境地，逐步进入伟大的社会主义—共产主义社会去！
