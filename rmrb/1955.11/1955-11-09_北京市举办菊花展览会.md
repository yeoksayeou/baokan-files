Beijing Holds Chrysanthemum Exhibition

    The Second Beijing Chrysanthemum Exhibition opened on the 6th at Zhongshan Park. On the first day, there were more than 26,000 visitors. This exhibition displays over 10,000 pots of chrysanthemums, totaling more than 700 varieties, many of which are very precious.
    Walking into the park entrance, one can see the four large characters "Chrysanthemum Exhibition" composed of chrysanthemums. Visitors can see various valuable varieties centrally displayed in Tanghua Dock. The Changzhou famous variety "Shuaiqi" and the Yangzhou famous variety "Liuxian" are called Chrysanthemum Kings and are very popular among visitors. Among the famous varieties are "Xingshitu" with petals curled up like a lion's head, "Erqiao" which grows yellow and ochre colors on one flower, "Shizhang Zhulian" whose flowers hang down like beaded curtains, and "Xingxingguan" whose flowers resemble a disheveled orangutan. The exhibition rooms of upright chrysanthemums and cliff chrysanthemums attract more visitors. An old horticultural worker with more than 20 years of experience excitedly pointed to Beijing's largest pot of upright chrysanthemums and said, "Last year, a large upright chrysanthemum grew at most more than 160 flowers. This year, I have cultivated 200 flowers." In a variety corridor, there are more than 500 kinds of blooming chrysanthemums. At the exhibition, people can also appreciate various beautiful patterns and fonts composed of chrysanthemums, including the slogans "Long Live Chairman Mao" and "Liberate Taiwan", as well as patterns such as red stars, peace doves, pagodas, pavilions, and bridges.
    The exhibition also opened a special room to introduce the experience and methods of cultivating chrysanthemums to visitors, and to show slides introducing the characteristics of chrysanthemum varieties.

    北京市举办菊花展览会
    北京市第二届菊花展览会六日开始在中山公园举行。第一天的观众有二万六千多人。这次展出菊花一万多盆，共七百多个品种，其中有许多品种是很珍贵的。
    走进公园入口的地方，就看见菊花组成的“菊花展览”四个大字。观众们在唐花坞里可以看到集中陈列的各种名贵品种。常州名种“帅旗”和扬州名种“柳线”被称为菊王，很受观众喜爱。名种中还有花瓣怒卷像雄狮头的“醒狮图”，有在一朵花上长出黄赭二色的“二乔”，有的花像珠帘下垂般的“十丈珠帘”，有的花像披发猩猩的“猩猩冠”。立菊和悬崖菊展览室，吸引着更多的观众。有二十多年工龄的老园艺工人指着北京最大的一盆大立菊兴奋地说：“去年一株大立菊最多长一百六十多朵花，今年我培植出二百朵了。”在一条品种廊里，有着五百多种盛开的菊花。人们在展览会上还可以欣赏由菊花构成的各种美丽的图案和字体，其中有“毛主席万岁”、“解放台湾”的标语和红星、和平鸽、塔、亭、桥等图案。
    展览会还开辟专室，向参观者介绍培养菊花的经验和方法，并且放映介绍菊花品种特征的幻灯片。
