　　Ouyang Yuqian, Liu Xianzhou, and Others Gloriously Join the Chinese Communist Party
    This year in Beijing, some outstanding university presidents, deans, and professors have gloriously joined the Chinese Communist Party.

    Ouyang Yuqian, the president of the Central Academy of Drama and a famous playwright, was honorably approved to join the Party in June of this year. He is sixty-six years old this year. He has been the president of the Central Academy of Drama since 1950 and was elected as a representative to the National People's Congress in 1954. In the past, under the influence of the Chinese Communist Party, he persisted in progressive cultural and artistic activities and made certain contributions to the theatrical cause. After liberation, under the education and leadership of the Party, he had a deeper understanding of the Party and a clearer understanding of the cause of communism. In recent years, his pursuit of the Party has been eager and firm, and he has actively studied Marxist-Leninist theory, with a significant increase in class consciousness. In the leadership work of the Central Academy of Drama, he has consistently demonstrated a positive and responsible attitude. His request to join the Party has been realized.

    Professor Liu Xianzhou, a representative to the National People's Congress, vice president of Tsinghua University, and a famous mechanical engineer, was recently approved to join the Party. He is sixty-five years old this year and has been engaged in education for more than thirty years. In his early years, he was a member of the Tongmenghui and participated in the Xinhai Revolution. After the liberation of Beijing in 1949, he actively supported the Party's various policies and participated in the ideological remolding movement, educational reform work, and social activities led by the Party. Through practice, he recognized the laws of social development and the great cause of the Party. He earnestly studied Marxism-Leninism, criticized his past erroneous ideas of not concerning himself with politics, and enhanced his understanding of communism. In the process of teaching reform, he resolutely implemented the Party's policies and closely connected with the masses. In March 1954, he formally submitted an application to join the Party and was admitted to the Party in October of this year, on the 38th anniversary of the socialist revolution.

    This year, Li Hua, professor of the Central Academy of Fine Arts and printmaker, Hu Shihua, former professor of the Department of Philosophy of Peking University (now a researcher at the Institute of Mathematics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences), as well as Ding ?, associate professor of the Department of Chemical Engineering of Beijing Institute of Technology, Li Xiuqin, associate professor of Beijing Medical College and director of the teaching and research group of Pathophysiology, Yuan Fang, associate professor of the Teaching and Research Office of Labor Economics of Renmin University of China, and others were also honorably approved to join the Party. They all personally participated in some social reform movements led by the Party after liberation, gained a relatively deep understanding and experience of the Party's policies and the Party's cause, actively applied to join the Party, and were admitted to the Party after review by the Party organization.
