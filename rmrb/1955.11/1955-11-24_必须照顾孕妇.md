On the front lines of industrial and agricultural production, women play a significant role, but in some places, the care provided for women is insufficient. For example, in the finished product department of the Hengfeng No. 2 Printing and Dyeing Factory in Shanghai, whenever a female worker takes leave, the personnel department always assigns pregnant workers to replace them. A piece of cloth with a wooden stick in the inspection room weighs more than thirty pounds. It takes a lot of effort to lift and move it, leaving them breathless. This not only does not reduce the work of pregnant women but increases their labor intensity. Another example is the Victory Agricultural Production Cooperative in Goushang Village, Sixth District, Laixi County, Shandong Province, which has thirty-five women who actively participate in field labor. For example, during the drought resistance effort this spring, they watered seventy acres of wheat and accumulated more than one hundred cartloads of green fertilizer in the summer. However, the leaders of the cooperative only focus on production and do not care about the health of women. From the spring of this year to the present, two women have suffered miscarriages due to overwork.

Production units in various regions must care for and take care of working women, especially pregnant women, and provide them with necessary health education.

　  必须照顾孕妇
    在工农业生产战线上，妇女都起很大的作用，但是有些地方对妇女的照顾，做得很不够。如上海恒丰印染织二厂成品部的检布间，女工一请假，人事科总是把怀孕的工人调拨来替代。检布间里一段布连木棍足有三十多斤重，端上搬下要花很大的力气，累得她们喘不过气来。这不但没有减轻孕妇的工作，反而加重了她们的劳动强度。又如山东莱西县第六区沟上村胜利农业生产合作社，有三十五名妇女，经常积极参加田间劳动。如在今春抗旱的时候，她们浇小麦七十亩，夏季积绿肥一百多车。可是社的领导上只顾生产，不关心妇女的身体健康。从今年春季到现在，就有两个妇女因劳动过度而小产。
    各地生产单位对于劳动妇女，特别是孕妇，必须加以关心和照顾，并且对她们进行必要的卫生常识教育。
