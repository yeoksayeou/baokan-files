To the Editor:

    Since late September, when Chairman Mao's instructions "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" were disseminated, over 90% of the farmers in Wucun Township, Jiangshan County, Zhejiang Province, have received a profound education in cooperation. The broad masses of poor peasants and lower-middle peasants among the new and old middle peasants are elated and eagerly request to join agricultural production cooperatives. For example, more than ten households, including Shen Qiming from Xiawu, Sancun, even carried wheat seeds to the Jianshe Cooperative in Sicun, requesting cooperative chairman Liu Huabing to admit them to the cooperative to plant winter crops together. According to incomplete statistics, 146 poor peasant households throughout the township have actively requested to join cooperatives; 14 old cooperatives are preparing to expand, and three new cooperatives are being established.

    We have learned from the lesson of last year, when we focused solely on establishing cooperatives and neglected production. This time, while promoting cooperation, we put forward the slogans "Establish cooperatives while engaging in production" and "Do a good job in production to welcome the establishment of cooperatives." Taking the agricultural cooperative as the core, we promote mutual aid teams and individual farmers to do a good job in autumn harvest and winter planting. In late September, more than 1,200 people and 120 waterwheels across the township were used to combat drought, ensuring that the yields of more than 2,800 mu of late autumn crops mostly caught up with or exceeded last year's levels. More than 300 people are engaged in accumulating soil fertilizer, digging more than 90,000 dan of pond mud and scraping more than 8,000 dan of grass skin ash. For example, the Zhaiqian Cooperative in Ercun has already accumulated 1,200 dan of grass skin ash, greatly exceeding past levels. While digging pond mud, the farmers also repaired the pond dikes, enabling each pond to hold more water than in the past. Because more pond mud was dug, more than 300 mu of idle land for planting barley and wheat throughout the township has been covered with pond mud. The work of digging white fields for winter planting is also progressing well. Since October 23rd, the Jianshe Cooperative in Sicun has been sending 33 cooperative members daily to dig white fields for winter planting, and they have rushed to plant 35 mu of barley, wheat, and 2 mu of broad beans in eight days. As of October 30th, the entire township has planted more than 873 mu of winter and spring crops, including intercropped buckwheat.

    建社同生产必须密切结合
    吴村乡农民边办社边生产编辑同志：
    我们浙江江山县吴村乡，自从九月下旬开始传达毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的指示以来，已经有百分之九十以上的农民受到了一次深刻的合作化的教育。广大贫农和新老中农中的下中农，欢欣鼓舞，积极要求参加农业生产合作社。如三村下坞沈启明等十多户农民竟挑了麦种到四村建设社去，要求社长刘华炳吸收他们入社一起冬种。据不完全统计，全乡已经有一百四十六户贫农积极要求入社；十四个老社正在准备扩大，有三个新社正在搭架子。
    我们接受了去年光抓办社、丢掉了生产的教训，这次在宣传合作化的同时，就提出了“边办社，边生产”和“搞好生产迎接办社”的口号，以农业社为核心，推动互助组和个体农民做好秋收冬种工作。九月下旬，全乡有一千二百多人、一百二十部水车车水抗旱，保证二千八百多亩晚秋作物的产量绝大部分都赶上或超过了去年的水平。有三百多人在从事积土肥的工作，共挖了塘泥九万多担，削草皮灰八千多担；像二村宅前社已经积了草皮灰一千二百担，大大超过了往年的水平。农民们在挖塘泥的时候，还修补了塘堰，使每个塘都比过去多装了水。因为塘泥挖得多，全乡已有三百多亩种大麦和小麦的闲田盖上了塘泥。挖白田冬种的工作也做得很好，从十月二十三日以来，四村建设社每天有三十三个社员挖白田冬种，在八天中抢种了三十五亩大麦、小麦和二亩蚕豆。全乡到十月三十日止，连套种的荞麦在内，已种下了八百七十三亩多冬、春作物。
