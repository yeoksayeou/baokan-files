　　More than 200 Forest Management Stations Established in State-Owned Forest Areas

　　To strengthen forest protection, nurturing, and renewal work, the state has established another 139 forest management stations in state-owned forest areas this year. There are now 291 forest management stations nationwide, managing a forest area that accounts for one-seventh of the total state-owned forest area. Forest management stations have now been universally established in the Changbai Mountain forest area and the Lesser Khingan Mountains forest area. In the Greater Khingan Mountains, in addition to establishing some management stations, most areas are undergoing surveys and designs in preparation for station establishment.

　　This year, the state has especially established forest management stations in large state-owned forest areas with inconvenient transportation and few people, and increased permanent scientific fire prevention equipment. An investment of 7.5 million yuan has been made in Heilongjiang, Jilin, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region alone. Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces plan to newly establish 122 management stations before the end of the year, erect more than 2,700 kilometers of telephone lines, build more than 1,800 kilometers of forest roads, add more than 40 modern transportation vehicles - cars, more than 800 horses, and also increase more than 250 knapsack sprayers and a large number of forest rangers. Heilongjiang Province has also established two chemical fire extinguishing stations. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has also taken various specific measures to strengthen forest protection work.

　　Establishing forest management stations for the scientific management of forests is a new task and a way of learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. Its main tasks are: during the fire prevention period, it will be responsible for organizing patrol inspection work to prevent forest fires from occurring in the forest area; and in accordance with the state-stipulated forest area management plan, dividing areas, building forest roads, clearing forest farms, and carrying out nurturing and renewal work, so that the logged forest areas can be quickly restored to forests.

　　In order to further promote the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and strengthen the scientific management of state-owned forests, the Ministry of Forestry plans to further strengthen forest protection and fire prevention work next year.

    国有林区建立了二百多处森林经营所
    为了加强森林保护和抚育更新工作，国家今年在国有林区又建立了一百三十九处森林经营所，现全国共有森林经营所二百九十一处，经营管理的森林面积达国有林总面积的七分之一。现在长白山林区和小兴安岭林区已普遍建立了森林经营所，大兴安岭除一部分建立经营所外，大部分地区正在进行调查设计，准备建所工作。
    今年国家特别在交通不便、人少的大片国有林区建立森林经营所和增加永久性的科学防火设备。仅在黑龙江、吉林和内蒙古自治区就投资七百五十万元。黑龙江和吉林两省在年底前预计要新建立一百二十二处经营所，架设电话线二千七百多公里，修建林道一千八百多公里，增添现代交通工具——汽车四十多辆，马八百多匹，还增加了二百五十多部背负式喷雾器和大批护林人员。黑龙江省还建立两处化学灭火站。内蒙古自治区也同样采取各种具体措施来加强护林工作。
    建立森林经营所对森林进行科学管理是一种新的工作，是学习苏联的先进经验。其主要任务是：在防火期间，将负责组织巡逻检查工作，防止林区发生火灾；并按照国家规定的林区管理方案，划分地区，修建林道、清理林场和进行抚育更新工作，使已采伐过的林区迅速恢复成林。
    为了进一步推广苏联的先进经验，加强国有林的科学管理，林业部计划明年更进一步加强护林防火工作。
