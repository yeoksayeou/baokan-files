　　Worker Newspapers Should Strengthen the Propaganda of Agricultural Cooperation
　　Zhang Qian
    The vigorously developing agricultural cooperation movement in the rural areas nationwide is not only a matter of vital importance to the 500 million peasants, but also a matter of vital importance to all workers and staff. This is because the accelerated agricultural cooperation is of utmost significance to socialist industrial construction, to the further consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance, and to the lives of the working masses. Precisely because of this, worker newspapers should publicize and explain the Party's guidelines and policies on agricultural cooperation, publicize the significance and current situation of the agricultural cooperation movement, and mobilize the working masses to actively support the cooperation movement. Some worker newspapers have recently strengthened their work in this area, and the Shanghai Labor Daily is one of them.

    For more than a month, the Labor Daily has relatively frequently publicized the great significance of the cooperation movement and the new situation of the movement, introduced the new changes brought about by the upsurge of cooperation in the countryside, and reflected the enthusiastic emotions of the vast number of peasants in welcoming the upsurge of cooperation. In this process, the newspaper not only used Xinhua News Agency's news to report on the specific situations of cooperative development across the country, but also particularly focused on reporting various fresh examples of the development of the cooperation movement in the suburbs of Shanghai. For example, it successively reported that after hearing the instructions of Comrade Mao Zedong, peasants in the suburbs of Shanghai actively participated in agricultural producers' cooperatives; after being organized, peasants in the suburbs of Shanghai actively increased production, with 90% of the cooperatives achieving a bumper harvest this year; peasants who had recently returned to their hometowns from Shanghai, some had already become new members; the director of an agricultural cooperative in the suburbs of Shanghai, based on personal experience, talked about the issue of everyone's heart being oriented towards cooperation, and so on. These events happening around the workers will obviously attract their interest and attention even more. When conducting this propaganda, the newspaper, on the one hand, often placed major news about the national and Shanghai suburban cooperation movement in prominent positions, making prominent reports; on the other hand, it paid attention to using a variety of forms such as news reports, current affairs talks, interviews with directors of agricultural producers' cooperatives, and small statistics on the great development of agricultural producers' cooperatives. This can both demonstrate the scale and momentum of the current cooperation movement, and meet the reading needs of the working masses. Recently, the Labor Daily has also continuously published popular talks, explaining that industrial construction should be regarded as the center, but agriculture should never be relaxed or looked down upon; the development of industry must rely on agriculture to supply grain and raw materials; the development of agriculture can make industrial products sell faster; the development of agriculture can increase the export of native and special products and exchange for more industrial machinery and equipment; cooperation is the fundamental way to develop agriculture, and so on. This is also very helpful for the working masses to systematically understand the relationship between socialist industrialization and agricultural cooperation, as well as the significance of the agricultural cooperation movement.

    While publicizing the significance and new situation of the agricultural cooperation movement, the Labor Daily also emphasized the responsibilities of the working masses in this process, mobilizing them to support the agricultural cooperation movement with practical actions. It is worth pointing out that the Labor Daily not only generally reported on the fact that peasants need a large number of industrial products and that industrial products from this city are being continuously transported to the countryside, but also vividly and specifically reflected the various support activities of Shanghai workers. The newspaper published such news and reports: "Labor models of Shanghai Agricultural Machinery Factory, etc., express strong determination to produce more agricultural machinery to support agricultural cooperation", "Substandard products cannot be given to peasant brothers", "Send industrial products to the countryside quickly". From these reports, people can see that workers in various positions are producing more, better, and cheaper industrial products, doing their jobs well, and enthusiastically supporting cooperation. In other news, the newspaper also reported vivid examples of Shanghai workers mobilizing their families to participate in agricultural producers' cooperatives. For example, Jiang Yide, a steelmaking worker at the state-owned Asia Steel Plant, after reading Comrade Mao Zedong's report on the issue of agricultural cooperation, bought books on agricultural cooperation during his days off and rushed back to his hometown to mobilize his wife to join the cooperative. Zhang Jingen, a carpenter at the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, after mobilizing his family to join the cooperative, also used his spare time to voluntarily help the cooperative repair agricultural tools. In this way, the newspaper closely combined the production tasks and daily life of the working masses with the cooperation movement, and further explained the flesh-and-blood relationship between workers and peasants.

    The Labor Daily enthusiastically treats the agricultural cooperation movement and comes up with many ways to publicize various issues of agricultural cooperation. This approach is worth greatly advocating. However, at present, many worker newspapers or newspapers mainly aimed at workers have not done so. For example, in the past month or so, the Anshan Worker Life Daily has not systematically explained the principles, policies, and significance of the cooperation movement to the workers. Anshan City has already produced a large number of steel and fertilizers to support the countryside this year, but the Worker Life Daily has not carried out vigorous propaganda in conjunction with the workers' production activities. In this way, the relationship between the working masses and the current cooperation movement cannot be seen from this newspaper, and it cannot play a role in mobilizing workers to support cooperation. This situation obviously needs to be changed.

### 工人报纸应加强农业合作化的宣传

　　工人报纸应加强农业合作化的宣传
　　张浅
    全国农村中蓬勃发展着的农业合作化运动，不但是五亿农民切身的事情，而且是全体职工切身的事情。因为，农业的加速合作化，无论对于社会主义工业建设，无论对于工农联盟的进一步巩固，也无论对于工人群众的生活，都有极其重大的意义。正因为这样，工人报纸就应该宣传和解释党关于农业合作化的方针和政策，宣传农业合作化运动的意义和目前的形势，动员工人群众积极支援合作化运动。有些工人报纸最近已经加强了这一方面的工作，上海劳动报便是其中的一个。
    一个多月来，劳动报比较经常地宣传了合作化运动的伟大意义和运动的新形势，介绍了合作化高潮在农村中引起的新变化，反映了广大农民迎接合作化高潮的热烈情绪。在这当中，报纸不仅运用新华社的消息报道了全国各地发展合作社的具体情况，还特别着重地报道了上海市郊合作化运动发展的各种新鲜事例。例如，它先后报道了上海市郊农民听到毛泽东同志的指示后，积极参加农业生产合作社；市郊农民组织起来以后积极增产，百分之九十的合作社今年丰收；不久以前从上海回到乡下的农民，有的已经成了新社员；市郊一个农业合作社社长，根据亲身体验谈人人心向合作化的问题，等等。这些发生在工人身边的事情，显然更会吸引他们的兴趣和注意。报纸在进行这一宣传的时候，一方面常常把有关全国和本市市郊合作化运动的重大消息，放在显著地位，作了突出的报道；一方面注意运用了通讯、时事讲话、农业生产合作社社长访问记、农业生产合作社大发展的小统计等多种多样的形式。这就既能表现出当前合作化运动的规模和声势，又能适应工人群众阅读的需要。最近以来，劳动报还连续发表通俗讲话，讲解了把工业建设当作中心，但决不能放松农业和看轻农业；发展工业必须要农业供应粮食和原料；发展农业才能使工业品销得快；发展农业才能增加土、特产品的出口，换回更多的工业机器设备；合作化是发展农业的根本道路等问题。这对于工人群众系统地了解社会主义工业化同农业合作化的关系以及农业合作化运动的意义，也是很有帮助的。
    劳动报在宣传农业合作化运动的意义和新形势的同时，还着重说明了工人群众在这当中所负的责任，动员他们用实际行动支援农业合作化运动。值得指出的是，劳动报不只是一般地报道了农民需要大量工业品、本市工业品源源运往农村等情况，而且是生动具体地反映了上海市工人的各种支援活动。报纸发表了这样的一些消息和通讯：“上海农业药械厂劳模等表示坚强决心，生产更多农业药械支援农业合作化”、“次货不能给农民兄弟”、“快把工业品送到农村去”。从这些报道当中，人们可以看到在各个岗位上的工人，正在生产更多、更好、更便宜的工业品，作好自己的工作，热情地支援合作化。在另外一些消息里，报纸又报道了上海职工动员家属参加农业生产合作社的生动事例。例如，国营亚细亚钢铁厂炼钢工人姜以德，读了毛泽东同志关于农业合作化问题的报告后，在休假日买了有关农业合作化的书籍，赶回乡下动员爱人入了社。上海第三钢厂木工张金根在动员家属入社后，还利用工闲，义务帮助合作社修理农具。这样，报纸就把工人群众的生产任务和日常生活同合作化运动紧密结合起来，并且进一步地说明了工人同农民的血肉关系。
    劳动报热情地对待农业合作化运动，想出很多办法来宣传农业合作化的各种问题，这种作法值得大大提倡。但是目前却有不少的工人报纸或以工人为主要对象的报纸，并没有这样做。例如过去一个多月中，鞍山工人生活报就没有向工人系统地讲解合作化运动的方针、政策和意义。鞍山市今年已经生产了大批钢材和肥料支援农村，工人生活报也没有结合工人的生产活动进行有力的宣传。这样，从这个报纸上就看不出工人群众同当前合作化运动的关系，不能起到动员工人支援合作化的作用。这种状况显然是必须加以改变的。
