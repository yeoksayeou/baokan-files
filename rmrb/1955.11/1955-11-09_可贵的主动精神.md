The Harbin Electric Meter and Instrument Factory had only completed 60% of its annual equipment installation tasks by mid-October this year, leaving 40% of the work to be done in the following two months. At this critical juncture, the Shenyang Electrical Machinery Factory, which was contracted to produce important equipment for the plant, sent a letter stating that "delivery could not be made on time" due to various reasons! Under these circumstances, the Electric Meter and Instrument Factory did not sit idly by and wait for the project to be "delayed," but actively sought improvements. They sent the deputy director in charge of basic construction to Shenyang Electrical Machinery Factory to urge progress and to promote to the workers of the Electrical Machinery Factory the tremendous role that the timely completion and early commissioning of the Harbin Electric Meter and Instrument Factory would play in the country's industrialization. They explained the great significance of timely delivery to the nation's construction. As a result, all the workers put forward a guarantee to deliver on time. At the same time, the Electric Meter and Instrument Factory sent specialists to form a joint team with the contracting factory to monitor production, identify problems in a timely manner, and resolve them on the spot. Through this joint effort, the situation has fundamentally changed: there is complete confidence that fifteen of the sixteen pieces of important equipment will be manufactured by December 10, and the contracting factory has also promised to strive to complete the other one.

This example of the Harbin Electric Meter and Instrument Factory solving the problem of equipment supply should attract the attention of those units that are still waiting and complaining about the failure to supply equipment on time. As long as these units that believe they have difficulties take the initiative and make a real effort, it is still possible to complete this year's basic construction installation tasks.

    可贵的主动精神
    哈尔滨电表仪器厂今年的设备安装任务，到十月中旬，只完成了全年计划的百分之六十，还有百分之四十的任务要在以后两个多月内完成。正在这个时候，给这个厂承制重要设备的沈阳电工机械厂来信说，由于种种原因，“不能按期交货了！”在这种情况下，电表仪器厂不是坐等工程“拖期”，而是主动争取好转。他们派了负责基本建设的副厂长去沈阳电工机械厂督促，并且向电工机械厂的职工宣传哈尔滨电表仪器厂的按期建成和提前投入生产对国家工业化的巨大作用；说明按期交货对国家建设的重大意义。结果，全体职工提出了按期交货的保证。同时，电表仪器厂派专人和承制厂共同组成联合组，负责掌握生产情况，及时发现问题，就地解决。经过这样共同努力，情况有了根本转变：十六台重要设备，有十五台完全有把握在十二月十日制成，另一台承制厂也答应争取完成。
    哈尔滨电表仪器厂解决设备供应问题的这一事例，应该引起那些还在等待和埋怨设备不能按期供应的单位的注意。只要这些认为有困难的单位采取主动态度，作一番实际努力，那末，完成今年基本建设的安装任务还是可能的。
