　　To Give Play to the Core Role of Party Groups in Agricultural Cooperatives
　　Zhou Chaojun
　　After the Hongqi Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jingxi Township, Minhou, Fujian, was established before the spring plowing last year, the increase in early rice production was still small, but the increase in late rice production reached 27%. As a result, the cooperative had a great impact on the masses. After that autumn, the cooperative further developed, expanding from the original 21 households to the current 207 households.
　　With such a large expansion of the cooperative, some cooperative cadres and members were worried about "difficulty in managing a large family" and were deeply afraid that it would collapse if it was not handled well. This year's summer harvest, the Hongqi Cooperative achieved another 15% increase in production, which reassured the members, and the cooperative cadres also felt that "a large family can be managed well."
　　Why can a large family be managed well? It turns out that there is a strong party group in the cooperative, who can follow the mass line and play a core role.
　　The party group of the Hongqi Cooperative has a total of four party members. The group leader is Zhang Shinuan, and the other three party members are Zhu Ruxiang, Lin Jinzhu, and Xu Yixue. Zhu Ruxiang is the head of the cooperative, and the other three are deputy heads of the cooperative. They rack their brains and run errands for the cooperative day and night, are in close contact with the members, and rely on everyone's strength to run the cooperative.
　　After the expansion work of the cooperative ended, the party group considered that the key to running the cooperative well was to find all possible ways to ensure increased production; to increase production, it was necessary to carry out winter fertilizer accumulation on a large scale. Therefore, the party group, through the cooperative management committee, arranged for the members to pick pond soil nearby on the one hand, and mobilized the members to pick soil oil from the Minjiang beach five miles away on the other hand. At that time, the pond soil was covered with a layer of white frost, and the river beach was bitterly cold. It was indeed a very hard work to pick soil to accumulate fertilizer. Therefore, a small number of members were not very enthusiastic about picking soil. The party members understood that without sufficient fertilizer, there would be no guarantee of increased production; without increased production, the superiority of the cooperative would not be demonstrated. The party group discussed this issue and proposed that practical actions must be used to lead everyone in doing a good job in fertilizer accumulation. Every day at dawn, the party group leader Zhang Shinuan braved the morning cold and rushed to the cooperative from his home more than a mile away. He would prepare chaff ash for padding the baskets when picking pond soil, pad straw by the pond, and find many wide springboards and lay them one by one on the side of the pond, so that the members could go to work and pick soil. After all the preparations were done, he went to mobilize everyone to go to work. When the members came to the pond, they were very happy to see the wide and flat springboard. Then they saw Zhang Shinuan barefoot, rolling up his trousers, and digging soil hard in the frozen soil cave, letting everyone carry it to the field load after load. Everyone was very moved, and immediately many people jumped into the pond to join in the soil digging. In the line of picking soil, other party members also played a leading role. The enthusiasm of the members overcame the severe cold. More than ten days later, 30,000 loads of pond soil and soil oil were piled up in the fields and open spaces of the Hongqi Cooperative, enough to improve the soil of 200 mu of land. This batch of fertilizer was equivalent to the price of 600 yuan, which added favorable conditions for running the cooperative well. This fact educated the members and the party members themselves. It shows that the power of the masses is huge, the masses need organization, and the masses need the leadership of the party.
　　Soon, the Party and the People's Government called on farmers to expand the winter planting area to increase more grain for the country. The farmers in Xujia Village have never had the habit of winter planting. In particular, they are not interested in growing wheat. They say that growing wheat "costs labor, materials, and energy, but a spring rain brings no harvest!" The party group understood the important significance of the call of the Party and the People's Government. At the same time, a good wheat harvest could solve the spring famine problem for some members. The party group believed that the difficulties in cultivation could be overcome. Is it a waste of labor? Such a large cooperative has plenty of labor, and should not be afraid of spending labor; is it a waste of materials? There is plenty of fertilizer. Everyone picked more than 30,000 loads of fertile soil in the previous period. The difficulty of heavy spring rains can also be overcome by opening ditches for drainage and rushing to harvest. Therefore, the party group led the party members to discuss and exchange opinions with the members and veteran farmers in their production groups. Finally, the whole cooperative unanimously approved a plan to plant 106 mu of wheat, 6 mu of barley, and 4 mu of rape in winter, expanding the winter planting area by more than eight times.
　　When the wheat was planted, things did not go smoothly. Because the weather had been dry and frosty, some wheat seedlings could not grow, and some were sparsely frozen, leaving only a few. In addition to other unsatisfactory things, the members talked a lot. In addition to reviewing the shortcomings such as unclear division of labor and the responsibility system not being well implemented to the members, the party group and all the cooperative cadres also carried out specific division of labor and strengthened the topdressing management of the wheat fields. Four months later, the wheat fields were golden. When the wheat was harvested, the cooperative harvested more than 16,000 jin of wheat. The members happily said, "If it weren't for expanding the winter planting area, how could we eat pancakes?" And the party group further realized that responding to the call of the Party, the direction is clear, and it is correct to guide the members to advance bravely.
　　When spring plowing and rice transplanting reached the final stage this year, the cooperative had more than 6,000 bundles of surplus early rice seedlings. The members decided to plow the seedlings away and use them as green manure. When the party group heard that several townships in Guanyuanli nearby were suffering from disasters and were short of early rice seedlings, they persuaded the members on the one hand and asked the farmer brothers in Guanyuanli to pull the seedlings on the other hand. However, due to lack of experience and inaccurate calculations, after transferring more than 8,000 bundles of seedlings, the cooperative was short of 2,000 bundles of seedlings. This caused dissatisfaction among many members. The comrades in the party group were criticized and had nothing to say. However, the farming season must not be violated. In addition to mobilizing the members to find seedlings from relatives and friends in neighboring villages, Zhu Ruxiang, Lin Jinzhu, Xu Yixue and others went to the surrounding villages early and late to find seedlings. Finally, they solved the shortage of more than ten mu of seedlings. This incident made the party members more clearly realize that anything must be fully discussed with the masses before it can be implemented.
　　During the spring famine, some poor farmers in the cooperative lacked food rations. The party group was also very concerned about this issue. The Xu Quanjia family had a thin foundation and was often sick, so that he could not participate in labor very well. The Xu Xueyao family had deficits every year. Around the time of spring plowing, his wife gave birth to a child, and life was very difficult. After learning about these situations, the party group seriously helped them solve their difficulties. For example, they suggested that the cooperative management committee lend some money to Xu Xueyao; in addition, they mobilized members with surplus rations to transfer grain to households in need. In this way, the living difficulties of poor households were overcome, and they actively worked hard and did a good job in production.
　　The summer harvest was coming, and it was estimated that the cooperative could harvest more than 200,000 jin of grain. Summer pre-distribution is really a big event for a large cooperative. To distribute dry grain, the cooperative did not have a warehouse or a large drying ground. In June and July, the weather is hot, and wet grain will heat up and sprout after being piled up for one or two days. To distribute wet grain, the weather is sunny and rainy, and the grain is dry and wet, with uneven quality, which is difficult to distribute fairly and reasonably. The party group already deeply believed in the power of the masses, and as long as they discussed with the members more, there would be no difficulties that could not be solved; therefore, the party group and the members and cadres seriously studied ways to ensure that the grain would not sprout and that the distribution would be fair and reasonable: The seventeen production groups in the cooperative were divided into six grain distribution units. Each unit poured the rice harvested each day together and carefully mixed it, and then distributed it to the members of each household in proportion according to the number of summer pre-distribution that each household should receive. At the same time, when distributing grain every day, each grain distribution unit weighed 100 jin of wet grain as a mark, and the cooperative sent a special person to dry the grain, and calculated the percentage of wet grain converted to dry grain for each grain distribution unit on a daily basis for settlement. This not only avoided the grain from heating up and sprouting, but also distributed it fairly and reasonably, making the members very satisfied.
　　This cooperative has only four party members, and the party's strength is still not strong. Therefore, the party group pays great attention to the work of developing party members. The party group often pays attention to cultivating and educating activists among the masses in their daily work. According to the instructions of the branch, the party group lined up the activists in the cooperative and carefully studied the composition, history, and level of consciousness of the activists. For those who can be developed into party members, in addition to requiring them to play a leading role in production, they are also mobilized to attend party classes and conduct in-depth individual education work for them. This spring, a support-the-front movement was launched. The party group believed that participating in the support-the-front work was the most practical education for improving the ideological awareness of activists. Therefore, the party group leader Zhang Shinuan personally led thirteen members to participate in the support-the-front work. In the more than two months of the support-the-front construction site, Zhang Shinuan led everyone to do a good job in supporting the front with selfless labor and meticulous care for his partners, and was awarded the second-class merit. This fact deeply moved the thirteen members who went with him. Under the influence of Zhang Shinuan, activist Xu Benqu was also awarded the third-class merit. When the good news came, the whole cooperative cheered. After the victorious end of supporting the front, Zhang Shinuan intensified his cultivation of Xu Benqu. He slept with him at night, talked about production, talked about work, and talked about the glorious history and great struggles of the Party. Under the constant education of the Party, Xu Benqu actively requested to join the Party, and has now been accepted by the branch as a probationary party member. In addition to Xu Benqu, some activists are of very good quality and are very active in labor production. The party group has assigned special personnel to be responsible for conducting individual education according to the characteristics of these activists, and is preparing to recommend the branch to admit these activists into the Party in batches before the end of this year.
　　Under the leadership of the party branch and the party group, the cooperative cadres and members of the Hongqi Cooperative are convinced that the cooperative can be run better in the future.

　　发挥农业合作社中党小组的核心作用
　　周朝俊
    福建闽侯荆溪乡红旗农业生产合作社在去年春耕前建立起来后，早稻增产还很少，晚稻增产就达到了两成七，因此合作社在群众中产生了很大的影响。这年秋后，合作社就有了进一步的发展，由原来的二十一户扩大到现在的二百零七户。
    社扩得这样大，有些社干部和社员曾经担心“家大难当”，深怕弄得不好垮了台。今年夏收，红旗社又获得了增产一成五的成绩，这就使社员们心安下来，社干部也感到“家大是可以当好的”。
    为什么家大能够当好呢？原来社里有一个坚强的党小组，他们能够走群众路线，能够起核心作用。
    红旗社的党小组共有四个党员，小组长是张世煖，另外三个党员是朱如香、林金珠和徐依雪。朱如香是正社长，其余三人都是副社长。他们日夜地为社动脑筋、跑腿，和社员们脉息相通，依靠大家的力量来办社。
    扩社工作结束后，党小组考虑到办好社的关键在于想一切办法来保证增产；为了增产，就必须大规模地开展冬季积肥。因此，党小组通过社务委员会一方面布置社员就近挑池土，一方面发动社员到五里路外的闽江滩去挑土油。当时，池土上盖着一层白霜，闽江滩头冷风刺骨，去挑土积肥确是十分艰苦的工作。因此，少数社员挑土的情绪就不高。党员们懂得没有充分的肥料，增产就没有保证；不能增产，社的优越性就显示不出来。党小组讨论了这个问题，并提出了必须用实际行动来带动大家搞好积肥工作。每天天刚亮，党的小组长张世煖就冒着清晨的寒风，从一里多路外的家里赶到社里，他一会儿去准备挑池土时垫畚箕用的糠灰，一会儿在池边垫稻草，一会又寻来了不少宽阔的跳板，一块一块的把它铺在池边，好让社员们出工挑土。准备工作都做好后，他又去动员大家出工。社员们来到池边，看见宽阔平坦的跳板，都十分欢喜。再看张世煖赤着脚，卷起裤子，在冰冻的土窟里用力挖土，让大家一担接一担地挑到田里。大家很受感动，立即有不少人跳到池里参加挖土。在挑土的行列中，其他几个党员也同样地起着带头作用。社员的热情战胜了严寒。十多天后，红旗社的田间和空隙地上堆积了三万多担池土和土油，足以改良两百亩田的土壤。这一批肥料相当于六百元的代价，为办好社增加了有利条件。这一事实教育了社员，也教育了党员自己，它说明：群众的力量是巨大的，群众需要组织，群众需要党的领导。
    不久，党和人民政府号召农民扩大冬种面积，为国家增产更多的粮食。徐家村的农民是向来没有冬种习惯的。特别是对种麦更不感到兴趣。他们说：种麦“花工花料花精神，一场春雨没收成！”党小组懂得党和人民政府号召的重要意义，同时小麦丰收以后，可以解决部分社员的春荒问题。党小组认为耕作中的困难是可以克服的，花工吧？这么大的社有的是劳动力，不该怕花工；花料吧？有的是肥料，前一个时期，大家一下挑了三万多担肥土。春雨多的困难，也可以用开沟排水和抢割抢收来克服。于是，党小组领导党员在自己的生产小组里和社员们酝酿，并找老农民交换意见。最后全社一致通过了冬种小麦一百零六亩、大麦六亩、油菜四亩的计划，扩大冬种面积达八倍以上。
    麦子种下了，事情却是不大顺利。因为天气一直是干旱多霜，麦苗有的长不出来，有的冻得稀稀疏疏地剩不上几条。再加上其他不如意的事情，社员议论纷纷。党小组和全体社干部除向社员检讨了分工不明确、责任制度没有很好执行等缺点外，又进行了具体的分工，加强了对麦田的追肥管理。四个月后，麦田里一片金光。麦收的时候，社里共收获了一万六千多斤麦子。社员们高兴地说：“要不是扩大冬种面积，那能吃到煎饼？”而党小组也进一步体会到，响应党的号召，方向明确，引导社员勇敢前进就错不了。
    今年春耕插秧到最后阶段时，社里早稻秧苗剩余了六千多束。社员们决定把秧苗犁掉做绿肥。党小组听到附近关源里几个乡因为受到灾害，早稻秧苗很缺乏，就一面说服社员，一面就叫关源里的农民兄弟来拔秧。可是，由于经验不足，计算得不精确，调剂了秧苗八千多束出去后，自己社里又短少了两千束秧苗。这就引起了不少社员的不满。党小组里的几个同志，被批评得没有话说。但是农时违不得，党小组除了动员社员向邻乡亲友设法调剂外，朱如香、林金珠、徐依雪等又起早带晚到周围乡里去寻找秧苗，最后，终于把所缺的十多亩秧苗解决了。这件事情，使党员们更加明确认识任何事情必须充分和群众商量清楚，才能实行。
    春荒时，社里有些贫农缺口粮。这个问题，党小组也是十分关心的。社员徐泉学家底薄，又多疾病，以致不能很好地参加劳动。社员徐学尧年年亏空，春耕前后，又逢妻子生小孩，生活十分困难。党小组了解了这些情况后，就认真地帮助他们解决困难。例如，建议社务委员会借一些钱给徐学尧；除此之外还动员口粮有剩余的社员将粮食调剂给困难户。这样，贫困户生活困难克服了，就积极劳动，搞好生产。
    夏收来临了，估计全社可收二十多万斤谷子。夏季预分对于一个大社来说，真是一件大事。要分干谷，社里没有仓库，又没有大晒场。六、七月里天气炎热，湿谷只要堆上一两天就会发热出芽。要分湿谷，天气时晴时雨，谷子有干有湿，成色不一，很难分得公平合理。党小组已经深信群众的力量了，只要多跟社员们商量，就没有解决不了的困难；因此，党小组就和社员、干部认真地研究了保证谷子不生芽和分配公平合理的办法：把全社十七个生产小组分成六个分谷单位，各单位把每天所收割的稻子倒在一起并仔细拌匀，随即根据各户夏季应预分数，按比例分给各户社员。同时每天分谷时，在每个分谷单位各称一百斤湿谷做记号，由社里派专人把谷子晒干，逐日计算出各分谷单位湿谷折算干谷的成数，以便结算。这样既避免了谷子发热出芽，又能分配得公平合理，使社员都很满意。
    这个社只有四个党员，党的力量还是不强的。因此党小组十分注意发展党员的工作。党小组在日常工作中经常注意培养和教育群众中的积极分子。党小组根据支部的指示把社内的积极分子排了队，并认真地研究了积极分子的成份、历史和觉悟程度。对于可以发展为党员的对象，除了要他们在生产上起带头作用外，还动员他们去听党课，并对他们做深入的个别教育的工作。今年春季开展了支前运动。党小组认为参加支前工作是提高积极分子思想觉悟最实际的教育，因此，党小组长张世煖亲自带了十三个社员参加支前工作。在支前工地的两个多月中，张世煖以忘我的劳动和对伙伴们无微不至的关心，带领大家做好支前工作，荣立了二等功。这一事实，使同去的十三个社员深为感动。积极分子徐本驱在张世煖的影响下，也荣立了三等功。喜报传来，全社欢呼。支前胜利结束后，张世煖更加紧对徐本驱的培养工作。晚上和他睡在一起，谈生产、谈工作、谈党的光荣历史和伟大的斗争。在党的不断教育下，徐本驱积极要求参加党，现在已被支部接收为候补党员。除徐本驱外，还有一些积极分子品质都很好，在劳动生产上都非常积极。党小组已根据这些积极分子的特点，分工负责进行个别教育，准备在今年年底以前，建议支部将这些积极分子分批吸收入党。
    在党支部和党小组的领导下，红旗社的社干部和社员都深信：今后合作社可以办得更好。
