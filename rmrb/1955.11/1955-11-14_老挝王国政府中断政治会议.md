　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 12th: A Vientiane radio broadcast on the 10th reported that the Lao Royal Government's Prime Minister's Office announced that it "cannot continue negotiations with the Lao side." The head of the Royal Government's political delegation also wrote to the Chairman of the International Commission for Laos, using the excuse that the Lao side had made "excessive demands" to suspend the negotiations.

　　The Lao Royal Government has refused to hold political meetings with the Lao Fighting Units delegation since the 4th. At the political meeting on the 4th, the Lao Royal side stubbornly rejected the reasonable suggestions put forward by the Lao Fighting Units regarding holding general elections in accordance with the spirit of the Geneva Accords and resolving the issue of the two provinces of Sam Neua and Phong Saly. The head of the Lao Fighting Units' political delegation, Phoumi Vongvichit, pointed out at the time that the Royal side should be responsible for the current situation.

　　The Lao "Freedom Newspaper" published a commentary on the 8th regarding the Royal side's unreasonable actions, demanding a swift resumption of political meetings. The "Freedom Newspaper" pointed out that after the Royal side interrupted the political meetings, it is intensifying its activities to hold separate general elections and is also strengthening military activities.

　　The "Freedom Newspaper" said that on November 6th, the Royal Army attacked Na Kieng again, and now the Royal Army illegally stationed in the Lao Fighting Units' assembly area has reached eleven battalions. The Royal Government is attempting to use force to encroach upon the two provinces where the Lao Fighting Units are assembled and eliminate the Lao Fighting Units in order to realize the American conspiracy to re-ignite the war in Laos and undermine the peaceful unification of Laos.

　　老挝王国政府中断政治会议
    据新华社河内十二日电　老挝消息：据万象电台十日广播说，老挝王国政府首相府宣布“不能继续和寮国方面进行谈判”。王国政府政治代表团团长也写信给老挝国际委员会主席，借口寮国方面提出了“过份的要求”而中止谈判。
    老挝王国政府自四日以来一直拒绝和寮国战斗部队代表团举行政治会议。在四日的政治会议上，老挝王国方面蛮横地拒绝了寮国战斗部队方面提出的有关依照日内瓦协定精神举行普选和解决桑怒、丰沙里两省问题的合理意见。寮国战斗部队政治代表团团长富米当时就指出，王国方面应对目前情况负责。
    老挝“自由报”八日就王国方面这种无理行动发表评论，要求迅速恢复政治会议。“自由报”指出，王国方面中断了政治会议后，正在加紧进行举行单独普选的活动，并且正在加强军事活动。
    “自由报”说，十一月六日，王国军队又向那经进攻，现在非法地驻在寮国战斗部队集结区的王国军队已经达到十一个营。王国政府企图用武力侵吞寮国战斗部队集结的两省，消灭寮国战斗部队，以实现美国的在老挝重新挑起战争、破坏老挝的和平统一的阴谋。
