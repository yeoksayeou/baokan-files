    Three Thousand Broken New Farm Implements
    The Hohhot Agricultural Machinery Factory in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region undertook the task of manufacturing 11,000 double-wheeled double-plowshares this year to support the agricultural cooperative movement, accounting for more than two-thirds of the region's total manufacturing task. Trial production was successful in March, and 3,110 units were produced by early October. However, who would have thought that all the products produced were unqualified? The entire plow was riddled with problems: the forged parts were of uneven length and incorrect curvature, and the cast parts had rough surfaces; no parts such as the stubble guard, wrench bolt, safety hook, support plate, and moldboard were qualified. What is the reason for this?
    Looking at the thoughts of the factory director, Liu Zhenman, it is not surprising. Supplying new farm implements to farmers in large quantities is an important measure for realizing agricultural cooperation, but Comrade Liu Zhenman did not think of this. What he thought about was pursuing output, grasping profits, and showing off his achievements. In order to rush the task to welcome "May Day," he personally took the lead, driving staff members and political workers who did not understand installation technology into the workshop to do assembly work. When the quality inspectors raised opinions on quality, he said that the drawings "are just things drawn on paper, and it is impossible to be completely correct in actual practice." Then he ordered: "Continue production and modify later, I will be responsible." The result was that the superiors influenced the subordinates. One of the factory director's assistants, Zhang Guichun, head of the production section, believed: "The plow is not an important machine, it doesn't matter if it's a bit longer, shorter, more square, or round"; the inspectors acted as "good guys" everywhere, not conducting inspections according to regulations; the director of the casting workshop used defective products to replace good products, wanting to win the title of "model workshop." How can such a factory produce qualified products?

    三千台坏的新农具
    内蒙古自治区呼和浩特农业机械厂，今年为了支援农业合作化运动，承担了制造一万一千台双轮双铧犁的任务，占自治区全部制造任务的三分之二以上。三月份试制成功，到十月初制成了三千一百一十台。但是，谁能想到，生产出的产品全部不合格。犁全身是病：锻件长短不一、弯度不对、铸件表面不光；挡草板、搬手栓、安全钩、支板、犁镜等零件没有一件是合格的。这是什么原因呢？
    看一看厂长刘振满的思想，也就不觉得奇怪了。大量供应农民新式农具，是实现农业合作化的重要措施，而刘振满同志却想不到这点。他所想到的是追求产量、抓利润、显示自己的成绩。他为了赶任务迎接“五一”，亲自带头，把不懂安装技术的职员、政治工作人员赶到车间去做装配工作。质量检查员提出了质量方面的意见，他就说图纸“不过是画在纸上的东西，实际去做不可能一点不错”。接着他就下令：“继续生产，以后修改，我负责任”。结果是上行下效。厂长的助手之一——生产科长张贵春认为：“犁不是什么重要的机器，长点、短点、方些、圆些，没啥要紧”；检查员到处装“好人”，不按规程进行检查；铸工车间主任，以废品顶好品，想争取“模范车间”的称号。像这样的工厂，怎么能生产合格的产品呢？
