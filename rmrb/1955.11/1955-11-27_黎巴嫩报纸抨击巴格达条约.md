　　Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, November 24th (TASS dispatch): "Al-Nida" published an article entitled "Dangerous Trend," exposing the aggressive conspiracy of the Baghdad Pact countries under the guise of so-called "defensive" nature.

　　"Al-Nida" first stated that the Baghdad Pact includes Britain, Turkey, Pakistan, Iran, and Iraq—"the only Arab country that has decided to obey foreign instructions." Then, it posed these questions to the participants of the Baghdad Pact member states' prime ministers' conference, which concluded on November 22nd: Who asked you to worry about the defense of us and our borders? Who authorized you to rudely interfere in our internal affairs? Why doesn't Macmillan do anything about maintaining peace in Europe, but is "concerned about peace in the Middle East"?

　　The author of the article emphasized that the Arabs are very aware of the aggressive nature of the Baghdad Pact, which is why they have refused to participate and will continue to refuse to participate in this pact.

　　黎巴嫩报纸抨击巴格达条约
    新华社二十六日讯　塔斯社贝鲁特二十四日讯：“邻人报”发表题为“危险的趋势”的文章，揭露了巴格达条约国家在所谓“防御”性质的字句掩盖下的侵略阴谋。
    “邻人报”首先说明巴格达条约包括英国、土耳其、巴基斯坦、伊朗和伊拉克——“这是唯一决定服从外国指示的阿拉伯国家”，然后它向十一月二十二日结束的巴格达条约参加国总理会议的参加者提出了这些问题：谁要你们为我们以及我们的国界的防务操心？谁授权你们不礼貌地干涉我们的内政？为什么麦克米伦对于维护欧洲的和平一事不做，同时却“关心中东的和平”呢？
    文章的作者强调说，阿拉伯人非常了解巴格达条约的侵略性质，因此才拒绝参加，并且将继续拒绝参加这个条约。
