    Works depicting Soviet socialist industrial construction and agricultural socialist transformation, as well as works reflecting the arduous struggles of the Soviet working class in the early days of the revolution, are particularly valued by Chinese readers. The People's Literature Publishing House published Gorbatov's novel "Donbass" and Panfyorov's novel "Bruski," with a total circulation of more than 60,000 copies this year. The China Youth Publishing House published Leonid Zharikov's novel "Friends in Need," with a first printing of 33,000 copies.

    Newly published Soviet and Russian classics have also been welcomed by readers. The New Literature Publishing House's new edition of Gorky's novel "Mother," the People's Literature Publishing House's publication of Mayakovsky's poem "Good!," and the China Youth Publishing House's "Selected Short Stories of Chekhov" are all bestsellers.

    Soviet children's literature also has a large number of young readers in China. The Young Pioneers Publishing House's translations of A. Rybakov's "The Dirk" and I. Bagmut's "The Happiness of Military School Students" are loved by children. A. Tolstoy's "Russian Folk Tales," which was published in 1952, has been printed for the sixth time this year.

    Adventure novels in Soviet literature books published this year are very popular. From May to the end of October this year, China Youth Publishing House translated and published ten adventure novel collections and single editions, with a total circulation of 2.21 million copies. Among them, "The Red Safe," which was first published in May, has been printed five times and distributed 410,000 copies; "Military Secrets," which was recently published in October, was printed 220,000 copies in one go. The "Stories of Soviet Border Guards," published by the Era Publishing House, has been printed three times from August to October. "Hiroshima Girl," a lengthy thriller by Soviet writer Kim Roman, describing the crimes of American imperialists in dropping atomic bombs on Japan and the Japanese people's struggle against the establishment of military bases, has recently been published in Chinese by the Writers Publishing House.

    From October 1949 to the end of September 1955, a total of more than 2,300 kinds of Soviet classical and modern literary works were translated and published nationwide, with a total circulation of more than 42.15 million copies. Books such as "How the Steel Was Tempered," "The Story of Zoya and Shura," "The Seagull," and "Courage" have been bestsellers since their publication.
