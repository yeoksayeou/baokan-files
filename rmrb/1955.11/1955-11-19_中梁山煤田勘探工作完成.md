The exploration work of the Zhongliangshan Coalfield in the Chongqing area was completed on November 8th after five years of arduous efforts, entering a new stage of well construction. Geological exploration data proves that the Zhongliangshan Coalfield is currently the largest coalfield in the Southwest. The coal reserves are abundant, enough for about a hundred years of mining; and the quality of the coal is also good, most of which can be refined into metallurgical coke for use in steel plants.

　　Chongqing area will strengthen the basic construction of coal mines next year, and the state investment will be more than doubled compared with 1955. In addition to the Pingdong in the South Wellfield of Zhongliangshan, which was started in September and will continue to be carried out, the Pingdong in the North Wellfield will also start construction next year. After the completion of the new well, the production capacity of coal mines in Chongqing area will be more than doubled than it is now.

　  中梁山煤田勘探工作完成
    重庆地区中梁山煤田的勘探工作，经过五年的艰苦努力，已在十一月八日结束，进入建井的新时期。地质勘探资料证明，中梁山煤田是目前西南最大的煤田。煤的蕴藏量丰富，可供开采约一百年；并且煤的质量也好，大部分可以炼制供钢铁厂使用的冶金焦。
    重庆地区明年将加强煤矿的基本建设工作，国家投资将较一九五五年增加一倍多。除在九月间开凿的中梁山南井田平硐将继续进行外，北井田平硐也要在明年开工建设。新井建成后，重庆地区煤矿的生产能力将比现在提高一倍多。
