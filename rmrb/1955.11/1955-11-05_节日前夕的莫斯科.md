　　Moscow on the Eve of the Holiday

　　On the streets of Moscow, yellow leaves flutter down from the trees lining the streets. The mornings are often slightly frosty, and yesterday it even snowed heavily. People are already feeling the breath of winter.

　　However, what people feel even more strongly is a special atmosphere unique to the eve of the holiday. Moscow has already donned its festive attire. The "Red Square," symbolizing the great friendship of all the nationalities of the Soviet Union, is always solemnly and grandly decorated. The slogans "1917-1955" and "The 38th Anniversary of the October Revolution" shine brightly on the buildings of schools and institutions. The ornate appearance of the Central Telegraph Office has won the praise of Muscovites. The banner slogans on the walls of its building read "The Fifth Five-Year Plan Has Been Completed Ahead of Schedule." Commemorative posters of the Great October Revolution Day have been put up along the billboards on the streets.

　　Hundreds of thousands of Muscovites will come to Moscow's most beloved street, Gorky Street, on the evening of November 7th. On this day and the next, large-scale people's celebrations will be held in the city's twenty-eight squares and fifteen district streets.

　　Sixty musical groups will participate in the concerts performed in specially built theaters. During the holiday, Muscovites can see actors from the Moscow Art Theater, the Maly Theater, the Yermolova Theater, the Moscow Soviet Theater, the Satire Theater, the Variety Theater, and the Vakhtangov Theater, as well as masters from the circus and acrobatics troupe, in performances on the streets and squares. This year, the right to hold the largest celebration on the Manege Square was won by the railway workers of the Moscow Hub Station.

　　Since the beginning of October, Moscow's stores have begun preparing to welcome the holiday. Extensive commodity pre-ordering work has been organized in the stores. In addition to the existing thirty pre-ordering points, twenty-three more food stores will also accept pre-orders during the holiday. During the holiday, cars, mobile diners, kiosks, carts, etc. will sell sandwiches, fruits, snacks, hot and cold drinks... on the streets and places where celebrations are held.

　　Like the working people of the entire Soviet Union, Muscovites are welcoming the great holiday with the joy of winning new victories in labor.

    节日前夕的莫斯科
    在莫斯科的大街上，黄叶从街旁树上纷纷飘落下来。早晨常常是微冻的，而昨天甚至落起鹅毛大雪。人们已经感觉到冬天的气息。
    但是，使人们更加强烈感受到的，是节日前夕的一种特有的气氛。莫斯科已经披上了节日的盛装。象征苏联各族人民伟大友谊的“红场”的装束总是庄严和隆重的。“一九一七——一九五五”，“十月革命三十八周年”，这些标语在学校和机关的房屋上闪闪发光。装饰华丽的中央电报局的外观，引起了莫斯科人的赞扬。它的建筑物墙上的横幅标语牌上写着“第五个五年计划提前完成了”。沿着大街的广告牌贴上了纪念伟大十月革命节的宣传画。
    成千上万的莫斯科人，将在十一月七日的晚上来到莫斯科的最可爱的大街——高尔基大街上。在这一天和第二天，市内二十八个广场和十五个区的大街上都要举行大规模的人民联欢会。
    在专门建筑的剧场上演出的音乐会，将有六十个音乐队参加。在节日期间，莫斯科人可以在大街和广场上的演出会上看到莫斯科艺术剧院、小剧院、叶尔莫洛娃剧院、莫斯科苏维埃剧院、讽刺剧院、滑稽剧院、瓦赫坦戈夫剧院的演员们，看到马戏团和杂技院的大师们。今年在练马场上举办最大的联欢会的权利，由莫斯科枢纽站的铁路员工们争取到了。
    从十月初起，莫斯科的各商店就开始准备迎接节日了。商店里组织了广泛的商品预订工作。除去现有的三十个预订处以外，在节日期间，还有二十三个食品商店也要接受预订。在节日期间，街上和举行联欢会的地方将有汽车、活动餐车、小卖处、小车等出售夹肉面包、水果、点心、冷热饮料……。
    莫斯科人像全苏联的劳动人民一样，正以在劳动中获得新胜利的欢乐心情来迎接伟大的节日。
