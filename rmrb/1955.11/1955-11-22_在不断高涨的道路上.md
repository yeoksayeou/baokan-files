　　On the Road of Continuous Upsurge
　　A. Rugovoi, Chairman of the "Forward" Collective Farm, Voznesensky District, Nikolaev Oblast, Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic

　　Our collective farm's land is located on the Black Sea coastal steppe in southern Ukraine. Large tracts of grain fields, vegetable gardens, rice paddies, vineyards, and pastures cover more than 3,300 hectares. We also raise large herds of cattle, sheep, and pigs.

　　About twenty-six years ago, when ten poor peasant households united in a collective farm, the labor union had only a few acres of land, five pairs of horses, one plow, and one cultivator. Now, our collective farm is a huge multi-departmental farm. Agriculture and animal husbandry in the farm are developing in an all-round way, commodity products are constantly expanding, and income is increasing. The collective farm has become a source of social wealth and improved living standards for rural workers. Our collective farm makes no small contribution to supplementing the country's grain and raw material resources.

　　Powerful machines alleviate our labor. The tractor team of the Voznesensky Machine Tractor Station works in the fields of the collective farm. The team has four crawler tractors, two wheeled tractors, and four combine harvesters. Power lines from the Aleksandrovsk Hydroelectric Station to the collective farm's production units have been erected. Twenty-five engines are powered by electricity. Twelve oil engines are used to irrigate the vegetable gardens. All heavy work on the threshing ground and in the livestock farms is mechanized.

　　The abundant machines with which the state fully equips agriculture make it possible for us to cultivate the land in accordance with all the requirements of agricultural science and constantly increase labor productivity.

　　Grain is the Source of Wealth for the Collective Farm

　　The grain economy is the foundation of all production in the collective farm. Our grain crops account for about 80 percent of the sown area. We are improving the level of cultivation, increasing the unit area yield of the fields year by year, and increasing grain production.

　　Our main crop, like other collective farms in southern Ukraine, is winter wheat. We sow about 1,000 hectares of winter wheat every year and obtain high and stable harvests. During the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the average unit area yield was 20 quintals per hectare. This year's harvest is particularly abundant. We harvested 22.5 quintals per hectare, exceeding the unit area yield specified in the perspective plan by more than two quintals. The harvest volume of many large tracts of land exceeded 180 poods.

　　A good harvest does not come by itself. It is won by selfless labor. We carry out autumn sowing in a timely manner in fallow land or land where the pre-cultivation crop is a row crop. Mineral fertilizers and local fertilizers are of great value for our sandy soil. These fertilizers are placed in the soil during cultivation and sowing. In early spring, we use airplanes to topdress the autumn-sown crops.

　　Many years of practical experience have convinced us that sowing by the cross and narrow row method can greatly increase the harvest volume. Since last autumn, we have begun to use corn to establish barriers on large wheat fields. Under our conditions, this measure helps to gather moisture. We only sow local variety seeds cultivated in seed plots. During the crop field management and harvesting period, all the strength of the collective farm members and machine operators is concentrated on ensuring that not a single grain is lost in harvesting the grain. We adopt the separate harvesting method, and the machine operators successfully adopted the group work method of combine harvesters.

　　We implement the historical resolution of the Party and the government on further improving socialist agriculture, and unswervingly seek ways to continuously increase grain production. Since last year, we have changed the composition of the sown area, replacing low-yielding crops with high-yielding crops.

　　Corn has brought invaluable wealth to the public economy. This year, the area we sowed with this feed grain crop has increased threefold compared to last year. We use high-yield seeds of the "Odessa-10" variety and sow by the square hole method. Diligent field management has never stopped for a day. We carried out three mechanical cultivations between rows and twice removed the grass around the holes, and completed some important measures such as harrowing and artificial pollination. The corn yield is excellent. Relying on corn, this year's total grain output will increase by more than 10,000 quintals.

　　Rice also occupies an important position in the grain balance of our collective farm. We have demarcated 130 hectares of river bay land on the riverbank floodplain of the South Bug River for rice paddies. The Ukrainian Rice Planting Science Research Station set up in our district gives great help to the collective farm's rice planters.

　　The change in the composition of the sown area, the expansion of corn sowing, and the mass competition to increase the unit area yield of all crops enable the collective farm to greatly increase the total harvest volume of grain. At the beginning of the Fifth Five-Year Plan, we harvested 11,500 quintals of grain, and at present, in the year of the completion of the Five-Year Plan, the total grain harvest volume of the collective farm is 36,750 quintals. On all areas, we have obtained much more harvest than stipulated in the perspective plan. This gives us reason to expect that we will be able to fulfill the obligation of harvesting 42,000 quintals of grain in 1960 ahead of schedule in the next two years.

　　Animal Husbandry is a High-Yielding Department

　　Expanding grain production is a decisive condition for the smooth development of all agricultural departments, especially animal husbandry, which is a high-yielding and high-income department.

　　Large quantities of refined succulent feed and roughage are needed to supply our cattle farms, pig farms, sheep farms, poultry farms, and stud farms. High total grain harvests enable us to establish a solid feed base.

　　Relying on the expansion of corn sowing, we ensure that livestock receive rich and diverse feed. This feed grain crop, which is excellent in terms of both unit area yield and feed quality, is a great potential for increasing livestock productivity. In last year's drought year, corn saved us. With a small amount of corn as a small feed ration, we not only avoided livestock mortality but also improved its productivity. The average milk yield from each dairy cow was 2,620 kilograms, almost 300 kilograms more than the previous year's target.

　　In the perspective plan, we stipulate that in two years, as required by the September Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, we will achieve as many livestock and livestock products per 100 hectares of agricultural land. We will first rely on improving the feeding and management of livestock to complete this task.

　　Corn guarantees us a reliable feed base. The task of establishing a two-year reserve of feed is put forward to the collective farm's livestock breeders. The establishment of a solid feed base has greatly affected the increase in the total number of livestock and livestock productivity. This year, each sow averages fourteen piglets. No less than 30 quintals of pork are produced per 100 hectares of cultivated land. Another 600 fattening pigs have been added. We use corn to feed fattening pigs, achieving an average weight increase of 700-800 grams per pig per day. This year, we averaged 193 quintals of milk per 100 hectares of cultivated land, grassland, and pasture. The production of wool, eggs, and other products has also greatly increased.

　　Animal husbandry in the collective farm is developing rapidly. This year, the collective farm received more than 1.2 million rubles from animal husbandry, accounting for almost a quarter of the total annual income.

　　The potential for livestock productivity growth is inexhaustible. The experience of advanced livestock breeders proves this point. For example, the milk yield of dairy cows cared for by milkmaids Yekaterina Krizhanovskaya and Ksenia Tishchenko exceeds the average milk yield of collective farm dairy cows by 500-600 kilograms. Advanced workers have shown all livestock breeders an example of using abundant internal potential.

　　Public Wealth is Growing, Labor Day Remuneration is Increasing

　　Our collective farm members have also achieved great achievements in other departments of public production. All economic departments of our collective farm have exceeded the plan tasks for 1955.

　　The collective farm completed the plan for paying grain and in-kind payments to the machine tractor station ahead of schedule and sold 3,000 quintals more grain to the state. Now we pay twice as much wheat as in the best harvest year of 1952. We sell 200,000 liters of milk, 220 quintals of meat, 700 tons of vegetables, and many other products to the state in non-compulsory sales. Quite a few products are sold on the collective farm's market.

　　The growth of commodity products is a condition for increasing the income of collective farm production. This year, our income per hectare of agricultural land is more than 1,600 rubles. According to preliminary data, the total monetary income of the labor union amounts to more than 4.3 million rubles.

　　The continuous increase in the income of the public economy makes it possible for us to invest a considerable amount of money in construction. Two standard cowsheds, three stables, some pigsties, some huge and solid standard sheepfolds, calf sheds, and chicken coops have been built, as well as two granaries with a capacity of 500 tons.

　　We have also built thirty-two houses, a collective farm cultural palace with an auditorium with 500 seats, and plan to build some nurseries, some standard field rest stations, an office building for the collective farm management office, and completed the construction of a milking room for 200 dairy cows, a wine-making workshop, and some other management buildings.

　　The material welfare of the collective farm members is improving. The monetary and in-kind remuneration for the labor of the labor union members has greatly increased. For each labor day, we pay ten rubles and three kilograms of grain, as well as some vegetables, grapes, watermelons, and other products.

　　The highly productive labor of the collective farm brings wealth to every family of our collective farm members, making their lives prosperous and cultured. The Voznyan family of three, who raise horses, received more than seven tons of grain, about three tons of vegetables, and 25,000 rubles in cash for their labor days this year. The families of shepherd Ivan Sharygin, milkmaid Ksenia Tishchenko, and many others also received no less grain, vegetables, and other products than the Voznyan family.

　　In addition to the main remuneration, collective farm members who overfulfill the plan tasks in agriculture, animal husbandry, vegetable farming, and other departments receive additional grain, meat, milk, and vegetables. Some advanced milkmaids have already received more than 3,000 liters of milk each relying on the additional remuneration.

　　This year, we implemented the monthly cash advance method for collective farm members, which greatly improved their material interests and promoted the consolidation of labor discipline and the surge in labor productivity. Not a single collective farm member has less than 200 labor days on his private account.

　　Cadres Determine the Success of the Cause

　　People are the creators of all social wealth. The Party organization of the collective farm, which has twelve Party members and alternate members, regularly engages in the training and education of cadres and enables them to improve their skills. The Party organization, as the fighting leader of the collective farm members, is good at concentrating the strength and creative initiative of the members to solve the tasks put forward by the Party and the government.

　　The Soviet collective farm members are knowledgeable and learned people who are familiar with the secrets of soil fertility and understand the principles of agricultural technology. Literacy was eliminated in the Soviet countryside a long time ago. In our collective farm, most workers have a seven-year education. Experts with secondary and higher education lead the main parts of collective farm production. In autumn and winter, collective farm members participate in agricultural and animal husbandry technology group studies. Agronomists help collective farm members study. In the past, there was only one agronomist in the Voznesensky district, and now there are six agronomists and two animal husbandry technicians working in our collective farm alone.

　　The collective farm system has awakened the talented experts in agriculture and animal husbandry. Every collective farm has many such people.

　　We have many talented experts in grain breeders, vegetable growers, milkmaids, shepherds, and pig breeders. Many of them have been rewarded by the government. They are unswervingly fighting for more rational and better use of our main wealth - the land, and for obtaining as many products as possible from a unit area.

　　在不断高涨的道路上
　　苏联乌克兰共和国尼古拉耶夫州沃兹湼辛斯克区“前进”集体农庄主席　阿·鲁果沃伊
    我们集体农庄的土地在乌克兰南部黑海沿岸的草原上。大块的谷物田地、菜园、稻米种植场、葡萄园、牧场共占地三千三百多公顷。我们还饲养着大群牛、羊和猪。
    大约二十六年以前，当我们十家贫农联合在集体农庄的时候，劳动组合只有几俄亩土地，五对马，一张犁和一架耕犁机。现在，我们集体农庄是一个巨大的多部门的农庄。农庄里的农业和畜牧业在全面发展，商品产品在不断扩大，收入在增加起来。集体农庄成了社会财富和提高农村劳动者生活水平的源泉。我们集体农庄在补充国家的粮食资源和原料资源方面有着不小的贡献。
    强大的机器减轻我们的劳动。沃兹湼辛斯克机器拖拉机站的拖拉机工作队在集体农庄的田野上工作。工作队有四部履带式拖拉机、两部轮式拖拉机和四部收割联合机。从亚历山大罗夫斯克水电站到集体农庄各生产单位都架设了电线。用电力开动二十五部发动机。利用十二部石油发动机来浇菜园。打谷场上和畜牧场上的一切繁重工作全都机械化了。
    具有国家充分装备农业的丰富的机器，使我们有可能遵照农业科学的一切要求耕种田地，不断地提高劳动生产率。
    谷物是集体农庄财富的源泉
    谷物经济是集体农庄一切生产的基础。我们的谷类作物约占播种面积百分之八十。我们提高耕作的水平，一年一年地在提高田地的单位面积产量，增加谷物生产。
    我们的主要作物，也像乌克兰南部其他集体农庄一样是冬小麦。我们每年播种约一千公顷的冬小麦，并且获得高额的、稳定的收获。在第五个五年计划期间每公顷的平均单位面积产量是二十公担。今年的收获是特别丰富的。我们每公顷收获了二十二点五公担，比前景计划规定的单位面积产量超过两公担。许多大片土地的收获量都超过了一百八十普特。
    丰收不是自己来的。它是用忘我的劳动争取到的。我们最适合农时地在休闲地或耕前作物是中耕作物的地里进行秋季播种。矿物肥料和当地肥料对于我们砂性土壤有很大的价值。在耕耘和播种的时候把这些肥料放到土壤里去。早春我们借助飞机给秋播庄稼追肥。
    许多年的实际经验使我们相信，用十字和窄行方法播种能使收获量大大增加。我们从去年秋季起开始实行用玉蜀黍在大片小麦田地上建立屏障。在我们的条件下，这种措施有助于聚集水分。我们只播种在种子地段中培育的当地的品种种子。在作物田间管理和收割时期，集体农庄庄员和机器操使者的全部力量都集中在收获谷物不能损失一颗谷粒上。我们采用分别收割法，机器操使者们成功地采用了收割联合机的分组工作法。
    我们实现党和政府关于进一步提高社会主义农业的历史性决议，坚持不渝地寻求不断增加谷物生产的方法。从去年起我们改变了播种面积的构成，用收获量多的作物代替了收获量少的作物。
    玉蜀黍给公共经济带来了难以估价的财富。今年我们播种的这种饲料谷物作物的面积比去年增加了三倍。我们以“敖德萨—十号”品种的高产种子，用正方形穴播法进行播种。勤劳的田间管理一天也没有停止过。我们在纵横行距间进行了三次机械中耕，两次铲除窝周围的草，完成了像打杈和人工授粉这样一些重要的措施。玉蜀黍的产量好极了。依靠着玉蜀黍，今年的谷物总产量将增加一万公担以上。
    稻米在我们集体农庄的谷物平衡中也占着重要地位。我们在南布格河的河岸水泛地划出一百三十公顷河湾土地供稻米种植场用。设在我们区的乌克兰种稻科学研究站给集体农庄种稻家以巨大的帮助。
    播种面积构成的改变，玉蜀黍播种的扩大，争取提高一切作物单位面积产量的群众性竞赛，使集体农庄能够大大增加谷物的总收获量。在第五个五年计划开始的时候我们收获了一万一千五百公担的谷物，而目前，在五年计划完成的一年，集体农庄的谷物总收获量是三万六千七百五十公担。在所有的面积上，我们都获得了比前景计划所规定的多得多的收获。这使我们有根据预料，我们将能提前在最近两年内完成一九六○年收获四万二千公担谷物的义务。
    畜牧业是产品率高的部门
    扩大谷物生产是顺利发展一切农业部门，首先是像畜牧业这样产品率高和收入多的部门的决定性条件。
    需要大量的精制多汁饲料和粗饲料供给我们的养牛场、养猪场、养羊场、养禽场和种马场。高额的谷物总收获量使我们能够建立巩固的饲料基地。
    依靠着扩大玉蜀黍的播种，我们保证牲畜得到丰富的各种各样的饲料。这种按照单位面积产量和按照饲料品质说来都是再好不过的饲料谷物作物，是提高牲畜产品率的巨大潜力。在去年的干旱年，玉蜀黍救助了我们。我们有了数量不多的玉蜀黍作为微少的饲料日粮，不仅避免了牲畜的病死，而且还提高了它的产品率。我们从每一头乳牛挤出来的牛奶平均为二千六百二十公斤，几乎比前一年的指标超过三百公斤。
    在前景计划中，我们规定两年内在一百公顷的农业用地上要达到像苏联共产党中央委员会九月全会所要求的那样多的牲畜和畜产品。我们将首先依靠改进牲畜的饲养和管理来完成这项任务。
    玉蜀黍给我们保证可靠的饲料基地。在集体农庄牲畜饲养者面前提出了建立两年的储备饲料这样的任务。巩固的饲料基地的建立已经大有成效地影响到牲畜总头数和牲畜产品率的增加。今年每一口母猪平均生十四口小猪。在每一百公顷耕地上生产不少于三十公担的猪肉。目前又增添了六百口肥育猪。我们用玉蜀黍作肥育猪的饲料，达到使每一口猪平均一昼夜增加七百—八百公分的重量。今年在一百公顷的耕地、草地和牧场上我们平均收获了一百九十三公担的牛奶。羊毛、鸡蛋和其他产品的生产量也大大地增加了。
    集体农庄的畜牧业在迅速地发展着。今年集体农庄由畜牧业得到一百二十多万卢布，几乎占全年收入的四分之一。
    牲畜产品率增长的潜力是取之不尽的。先进牲畜饲养者的经验证明了这点。例如，由女挤奶员叶卡切里娜·克里然诺夫斯卡娅、克辛尼雅·提申科照管的乳牛的挤奶量，超过集体农庄乳牛平均挤奶量五百—六百公斤。先进工作者向所有的牲畜饲养者表明了利用丰富的内部潜力的范例。
    公共财富在增长，劳动日报酬在提高
    我们集体农庄庄员在公共生产的其他部门也获得了巨大的成就。我们集体农庄的一切经济部门都超过一九五五年的计划任务。
    集体农庄提前完成了缴纳谷物和给机器拖拉机站实物支付的计划，并且多卖给国家三千公担的谷物。现在我们缴纳的小麦比收成最好的一九五二年多一倍。在非义务出售方面卖给国家二十万公升牛奶，二百二十公担肉类，七百吨蔬菜和其他许多产品。有不少的产品在集体农庄的市场上销售。
    商品产品的增长是提高集体农庄生产收入额的条件。今年我们每公顷农业用地收入一千六百卢布以上。根据初步的材料，劳动组合的货币总收入计达四百三十万卢布以上。
    公共经济收入的不断提高使我们有可能以颇大的金额投入建设。建成了两个标准牛栏，三个马厩，一些猪舍，一些巨大而坚固的标准羊舍、牛犊舍和鸡舍，还建成了两座容量五百吨的谷仓。
    我们还建成了三十二所住宅，一所有五百个席位观众厅的集体农庄文化宫，计划建设一些托儿所，一些标准的田间休息站，一所集体农庄管理处办事处，完成了容纳二百头乳牛的挤奶室，一所酿造葡萄酒车间和一些其他经营管理用的建筑物的建设。
    集体农庄庄员的物质福利在提高。劳动组合组员劳动的货币报酬和实物报酬大大地增加了。每一个劳动日我们付给十个卢布和三公斤谷物，还付给一些蔬菜、葡萄、西瓜和其他产品。
    集体农庄的高度生产率的劳动把富裕带给我们集体农庄庄员的各个家庭，使他们的生活富裕和有文化。饲马员彼得·沃兹尼扬的三口之家，今年的劳动日得到七吨以上的谷物，约三吨的蔬菜和两万五千卢布的现金。牧羊员伊凡·沙雷金、女挤奶员克辛尼雅·提申科和其他许多人的家庭得到的谷物、蔬菜和其他产品也不比沃兹尼扬家少。
    除了主要的报酬以外，超额完成农业、畜牧业、蔬菜业和其他部门的计划任务的集体农庄庄员获得补加的谷物、肉类、牛奶和蔬菜。一些先进的女挤奶员依靠着补加的报酬每人已经得到了三千公升以上的牛奶。
    今年，我们实行了集体农庄庄员的每月现金预付办法，大大提高了他们的物质利益，促进了劳动纪律的巩固和劳动生产率的高涨。我们没有一个集体农庄庄员在他的私人账上少于二百个劳动日。
    干部决定事业的成功
    人是一切社会财富的创造者。共有十二名党员和候补党员的集体农庄的党组织，经常从事干部的培养、教育工作并使他们提高技能。党的组织作为集体农庄庄员的战斗的领导者，善于集中庄员们的力量和创造性的主动精神来解决党和政府提出的任务。
    苏联集体农庄庄员是熟识土地肥力的秘密、通晓农业技术原理的、有知识、有学问的人。苏联农村在很久很久以前就扫除了文盲。在我们的集体农庄里大多数劳动者都有七年级的教育程度。有中等和高等教育程度的专家领导集体农庄生产的主要部分。在秋季和冬季，集体农庄庄员参加农牧技术小组学习。农艺师帮助集体农庄庄员学习。过去在沃兹湼辛斯克区只有一个农艺师，而现在仅在我们的集体农庄工作的就有六个农艺师和两个饲畜师。
    集体农庄制度唤起了农业和畜牧业的天才的能手。每一个集体农庄都有很多这样的人。
    我们在谷物培育员、蔬菜栽培员、女挤奶员、牧羊员和养猪员中间有不少本行的有才干的能手。其中许多人受到政府的奖励。他们为争取更合理和更好地利用我们的主要财富——土地，为争取从一个单位面积上获得尽可能多的产品而坚持不渝地斗争着。　　（本报特约稿）
