Xinhua News Agency, 29th—Albanian Ambassador to China, Nesti Nase, held a grand reception on the evening of the 29th to celebrate the 11th anniversary of Albania's liberation.

Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, Zhou Enlai, attended this evening's reception.

At the beginning of the reception, the band played the national anthems of Albania and China.

Albanian Ambassador to China, Nesti Nase, spoke first at the meeting. He said: The great victory of November 29, 1944, was won by the Albanian people under the leadership of the Albanian Communist Party, which is today the Albanian Labor Party, after centuries of bloody struggle for freedom and independence. On this festive day, the Albanian people express their deep gratitude to their liberator, the Soviet Union, because without the heroic struggle of the Soviet people and the glorious victory of the glorious Soviet army over the brutal enemy, Albania could not have become a free, independent, and people's Albania.

Nase said: Under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party, which is loyal to the immortal teachings of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, and with the help of the great Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people's democratic countries in all aspects, the People's Republic of Albania is growing and prospering. Eleven years ago, our country had almost no industry, but now, the most modern factories and plants of the Soviet Union have been established; agriculture, which was backward yesterday, and whose cultivation methods were extremely primitive, has made great progress in its development and modernization, and hundreds of tractors are running in our fields. In the past, Albania had almost no or very few schools, but now, schools and education have become daily necessities for the general working people of our country, like bread and air. Yesterday was darkness and ignorance, but today the situation has undergone a fundamental change, and art and new culture are flourishing.

Nase said: Today, the international position of the People's Republic of Albania has been elevated to an unprecedented level. Immortal friendship closely links the Albanian people with the 900 million people of the great socialist peace camp. In order to defend the victories gained in the past eleven years, and to defend peace in the Balkan Peninsula and the world, the Albanian people have waged a resolute struggle; at the same time, the Albanian people have also made valuable contributions to easing international tensions and strengthening the ties between the peoples of all countries and mutual trust between countries around the world.

Nase said: The Albanian people and the great Chinese people are closely linked by great friendship. The Albanian people have always had deep feelings for the great and heroic Chinese people. The Albanian people believe that China is their strong, close, and loyal friend, and it is also an important factor in defending peace in Asia and the world and the progress of mankind. Our two fraternal peoples, on the road of socialist construction, under common goals, and united into a big family with the Soviet Union as the head, are closely linked by a great and sincere friendship. For the first time in history, cooperation in political, economic, and cultural aspects has been established between our two countries.

Nase finally said: Today, the Albanian people once again express their deep gratitude to the great Chinese people for the valuable assistance they have given to the Albanian people in socialist construction, and sincerely congratulate New China on its new victories in socialist construction. This victory is also the victory of the socialist peace camp and a great contribution to defending and further consolidating world peace.

Premier Zhou Enlai then spoke. On behalf of the Chinese people and the Government of the People's Republic of China, he extended warm congratulations to the Albanian people and the Government of the People's Republic of Albania.

Premier Zhou Enlai said: For eleven years, the heroic Albanian people, under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party and the Albanian government, and with the help of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, have been victoriously carrying out socialist construction. At present, the Albanian people are smoothly carrying out the tasks of the last year of the first five-year plan. The completion of the five-year plan will transform Albania from a backward agricultural country into an agricultural-industrial country. The Albanian people are peace-loving, and they have waged a strong struggle to maintain peace in Europe and the world. The Chinese people are happy for every achievement made by the fraternal Albanian people in creating their own happy life and defending world peace. Your just cause will always receive the full support of the Chinese people.

Premier Zhou Enlai also said that the comprehensive friendly cooperation between the Chinese and Albanian peoples has greatly developed. This year, mutual visits by cultural, artistic, and other delegations from our two countries, especially the outstanding performance of the Albanian People's Army Song and Dance Troupe in China, have further deepened the close friendship between the Chinese and Albanian peoples. The Chinese people cherish this fraternal friendship very much and will continue to consolidate and develop this friendship to promote the common prosperity of our two countries.

A total of more than 700 people attended tonight's reception. Among them were Peng Zhen, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Mayor of Beijing, Li Xiannian, Vice Premier of the State Council, Long Yun, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council, Ji Pengfei, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, General Chen Geng, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Zhang Bojun, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, as well as directors and deputy directors of various offices of the State Council, ministers and deputy ministers of various ministries, members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, members of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and heads of various democratic parties and people's organizations, and well-known figures from the capital's scientific, educational, literary and art, and journalistic circles.

    新华社二十九日讯阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国驻中国大使纳赛，二十九日晚间举行盛大招待会，庆祝阿尔巴尼亚解放十一周年。
    中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来出席了今晚的招待会。
    招待会开始，乐队奏阿尔巴尼亚和中国国歌。
    阿尔巴尼亚驻中国大使纳赛首先在会上讲话。他说：一九四四年十一月二十九日这一伟大的胜利，是阿尔巴尼亚人民在阿尔巴尼亚共产党也就是今天的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的领导下，几世纪来为了自由和独立所作的流血斗争而获得的。在这个节日里，阿尔巴尼亚人民向他的解放者——苏联，表示深厚的感激，因为，如果没有苏联人民的英勇斗争，没有光荣的苏联军队对残酷的敌人的辉煌胜利，阿尔巴尼亚不可能成为一个自由、独立和人民的阿尔巴尼亚。
    纳赛说：在忠于马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的不朽学说的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的领导下，在伟大的苏联、中华人民共和国以及各人民民主国家各方面的帮助下，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国日益发展和繁荣了。十一年以前的我国，工业几乎没有，而现在，苏联的最新式的制造厂和工厂都建立起来了；农业，昨天还是落后的，耕作方法也极为原始的，但是今天，在它的发展和现代化的过程中，已获得了很大的进步，成百部拖拉机在我国的田野里奔驰。过去，阿尔巴尼亚几乎没有或者很少有学校，而现在，学校和教育，对于我国一般普通劳动者，都成为像面包和空气一样的日常必需品了。昨天还是黑暗和愚昧的，而今天情况已获得了根本的改变，艺术和新文化在蓬勃地发展着。
    纳赛说：今天，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国的国际地位得到了前所未有的提高。不朽的友谊把阿尔巴尼亚人民和伟大的社会主义和平阵营的九亿人民紧紧地联系在一起。为了保卫十一年来获得的胜利，为了保卫巴尔干半岛和全世界的和平，阿尔巴尼亚人民曾作了坚决的斗争；同时，为了缓和国际紧张局势，为了加强各国人民的联系以及世界各国之间的相互信任，阿尔巴尼亚人民也作了宝贵的贡献。
    纳赛说：阿尔巴尼亚人民和伟大的中国人民，在伟大的友谊下紧紧地联系在一起，阿尔巴尼亚人民对于伟大的英勇的中国人民一贯地有着深厚的感情，阿尔巴尼亚人民认为，中国是自己的强大的，亲近的和忠诚的朋友，同时它也是保卫亚洲和世界和平以及人类进步的重要因素。我们两国兄弟人民，在社会主义建设的道路上、在共同的目标下，和以苏联为首的各人民民主国家团结成一个大家庭，一个伟大的真诚的友谊，把他们紧密地联系在一起。我们两国之间有史以来第一次建立了政治、经济和文化各方面的合作联系。
    纳赛最后说：今天，阿尔巴尼亚人民再一次地向伟大的中国人民表示深切的谢意，感谢他们在阿尔巴尼亚人民社会主义建设方面给他们的宝贵的帮助，并衷心地祝贺新中国在社会主义建设中获得新的胜利，这种胜利也是社会主义和平阵营的胜利，是保卫和进一步巩固世界和平的巨大贡献。
    周恩来总理接着讲话。他代表中国人民和中华人民共和国政府向阿尔巴尼亚人民和阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府表示热烈的祝贺。
    周恩来总理说：十一年以来，英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚政府的领导下，在苏联和人民民主国家的帮助下，正在胜利地进行着社会主义建设。目前，阿尔巴尼亚人民正在顺利地执行着第一个五年计划最后一年的任务。五年计划的完成将使阿尔巴尼亚从一个落后的农业国家变成一个农业—工业国家。阿尔巴尼亚人民是热爱和平的，他们为维护欧洲和世界和平进行了坚强的斗争。兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民在创造自己幸福生活和保卫世界和平的斗争中所取得的每一个成就都使中国人民感到高兴。你们的正义事业将永远得到中国人民的全力支持。
    周恩来总理又说，中阿两国人民的全面的友好合作关系已经有了很大的发展。今年我们两国的文化、艺术等各种代表团的相互访问，尤其是阿尔巴尼亚人民军歌舞团在中国的卓越演出，进一步加深了中阿两国人民之间的亲密友谊。中国人民十分珍视这种兄弟般的友谊，并且将不断地巩固和发展这种友谊，以促进我们两国的共同繁荣。
