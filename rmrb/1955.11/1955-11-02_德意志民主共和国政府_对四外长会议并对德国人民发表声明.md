Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, November 1st (TASS dispatch): The Government of the German Democratic Republic has issued a statement to the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference in Geneva and to the German people. The statement said: At the Geneva meeting of the heads of government of the four powers, the four powers once again affirmed their obligations: to take appropriate measures to ensure European security and to resolve the German question in accordance with the national interests of the German people. The corresponding task is before the Foreign Ministers' Conference now meeting in Geneva.

The statement pointed out: The German people firmly advocate that the representatives of the two German states existing in Germany today should participate in the discussion of all issues related to Germany. The refusal of the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France to allow representatives of the German people to attend the Geneva Conference clearly violates the spirit of the four-power summit conference. The government of the Federal Republic of Germany, disregarding the national interests of Germany, has also expressed its opposition to the participation of representatives of the German people in the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference. The statement said: The Government of the German Democratic Republic considers this disrespect for the sovereign rights of the German people to be intolerable. It firmly maintains the legitimate demand to include representatives of the two German states in international conferences to discuss the German question.

The statement also said that the Government of the German Democratic Republic firmly maintains that the external conditions for resolving the German question must be created by establishing a European collective security system. At the same time, it believes that the reunification of Germany is primarily a matter for the German people themselves. In order to peacefully resolve the German question as soon as possible, Germans must have mutual understanding.

The statement advocates the establishment of an all-German body to coordinate all efforts aimed at promoting cooperation between the two German states and restoring German unity, and suggests that a German committee composed of representatives of the legislative bodies of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany be established as the aforementioned body.

    德意志民主共和国政府
    对四外长会议并对德国人民发表声明
    新华社一日讯　据塔斯社柏林一日讯：德意志民主共和国政府对日内瓦四国外交部长会议和对德国人民发表了声明。声明说：在四大国政府首脑日内瓦会议上，四大国再一次肯定了自己的义务：要采取适当的措施，来保障欧洲安全和按照德国人民的民族利益解决德国问题。相应的任务摆在现在正在日内瓦开会的外交部长会议面前。
    声明指出：德国人民坚决主张：今天在德国存在的两个德意志国家的代表，要参加关系德国的一切问题的讨论。美、英、法三国外交部长拒绝让德国人民的代表出席日内瓦会议，这明显地违背四国政府首脑会议的精神。德意志联邦共和国政府不考虑德国的民族利益，也表示反对德国人民的代表参加日内瓦外长会议。声明说：德意志民主共和国政府认为这样不尊重德国人民的主权权利是不能容忍的。它仍然坚决主张吸收两个德意志国家的代表参加国际会议讨论德国问题的合理要求。
    声明还说，德意志民主共和国政府坚决主张必须通过建立欧洲集体安全来创造解决德国问题的外部条件，同时认为，恢复德国统一首先是德国人民自己的事情。为了早日和平解决德国问题，德国人之间必须互相谅解。
    声明主张建立一个全德机构，来协调以促进两个德国合作和恢复德国统一为目的的一切努力，并且建议由德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国两国立法机构的代表成立一个全德委员会作为上述机构。
