　　Don't Be Fooled by Old Experiences
    On October 17th, the iron hoes (farming tools) were sold out at the means of production department store of the Bacheng District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Kunshan County, Jiangsu Province. What was the reason for this? Was the sell-out of iron hoes due to a lack of raw materials and difficulties in processing? No. Was it that the staff of the supply and marketing cooperative did not know that this year's agricultural harvest was abundant? Also no. Then why weren't these goods sufficiently prepared? It turned out that the comrades at this means of production department store of the supply and marketing cooperative were fooled by "old experiences." Last year, this department store stocked more than 300 iron hoes, but only sold about 20. This was, of course, an overstock. But instead of studying the reasons for the overstock, they assumed that things that didn't sell well last year would definitely not sell well this year. Therefore, they did not process new goods before the autumn harvest, which resulted in a sell-out.

　　不要上老经验的当
    十月十七日，江苏省昆山县巴城区供销社生产资料门市部的铁搭（农具）脱销了。这是什么原因呢？铁搭脱销，是不是因为原料缺乏加工困难？不是的。是不是供销社的工作人员不知道今年农业丰收？也不是的。那末为什么不充分准备这种货物呢？原来这个供销社生产资料门市部的同志是上了“老经验”的当。去年这个门市部进了三百多把铁搭，结果只销了二十多把。这当然是积压啰。但是他们不去研究造成积压的原因，就认为去年不好销的东西今年一定不好销。因此，在秋收前就没有再加工新货，结果却发生了脱销。
