　　The Harm of Blindly Pursuing Profit
    Some handicraftsmen in Nanning and Wuzhou cities in Guangxi Province, pursuing profit, cut corners, sought quick results, and reduced the quality of their products. At a handicraft product exhibition in Nanning City, there were more than 160 kinds and more than 1,100 pieces of substandard products on display. One lined indigo cloth cotton coat had its right lapel more than half an inch longer than its left lapel, and one pair of suit trousers had legs of unequal length.
    The low quality of handicraft products not only damages the interests of consumers but also seriously affects the income of handicraftsmen due to poor sales. The ink-making industry in Wuzhou City had to reduce its production because the quality of the ink was very poor and sales were bad. The vegetable knives made by the Qunli Ironware Cooperative in Nanning City had dull blades and were difficult to sell, which reduced the production and the income of each member by six to eight yuan per month. These facts all show that lowering quality is by no means the correct way to seek profit!

　　盲目追求利润的害处
    广西省南宁、梧州两个市的部分手工业者，追求利润，偷工减料，贪多图快，降低了产品的质量。南宁市的一次手工业产品展览会上陈列的次等产品就有一百六十多种，一千一百多件。有一件反领蓝布大棉衣，右襟长过左襟大半寸，一件西装裤两条裤腿长短不齐。
    手工业产品质量低劣，不仅使消费者的利益受到损害，还因销售困难，严重地影响了手工业者的收入。梧州市的制墨业，由于墨汁的质量很坏，销路不好，结果不得不缩减产量。南宁市群力铁器社打的菜刀刀口不利，不好推销，产量降低，使社员每人每月收入减少了六元到八元。这些事实都说明：降低质量决不是求得利润的正确道路！
