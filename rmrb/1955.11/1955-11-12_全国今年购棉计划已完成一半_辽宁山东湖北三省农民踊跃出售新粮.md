Xinhua News Agency, November 11th: The amount of cotton purchased nationwide in September and October has reached half of the 1955 cotton procurement plan. The national cotton procurement plan for October was also overfulfilled. The October procurement volume in nineteen provinces and cities, including Hebei, Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, and Zhejiang, increased by 46% compared to September. The new cotton fibers acquired this year have strong tensile strength and are longer than last year's cotton.

Most supply and marketing cooperatives in cotton-producing areas have adopted the working method of "quick collection, quick ginning, and quick transportation" when new cotton is marketed in large quantities. Some supply and marketing cooperatives in some areas have also organized mobile purchasing teams and material exchange fairs to facilitate cotton sales for the masses. Most power-driven ginneries in various regions have also improved labor organization and launched labor competitions to increase production and ensure quality. Supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions have also organized private cotton gins to assist in ginning.

According to Xinhua News Agency: New grain has been launched on the market in Liaoning Province. More and more farmers are driving carts every day, selling new grain to state purchasing stations. By the end of October, farmers across the province had sold more than 68,800 tons of new grain. Much of the grain sold to the state by farmers has been selected, dried, and winnowed, ensuring high quality.

Grain departments in various regions have made full preparations before receiving new grain. The Provincial Grain Bureau has trained more than 500 grain depot directors and cadres responsible for storage, testing, and other grain reception tasks. More than 700 new grain receiving points have been added throughout the province, ensuring that every district has a procurement agency.

This newspaper reports: Farmers in Shandong Province are enthusiastically selling grain to the state. As of October 14, the state had purchased more than 407,170,000 catties of grain, more than double the amount purchased in the same period last year.

The volume of new grain entering the market in Hubei Province is increasing daily. Farmers in disaster areas are particularly eager to sell their surplus grain to the state. Up to the beginning of October, farmers across the province had sold 1.3 billion catties of grain to the state, of which more than 800 million catties were sold by farmers in areas affected by disasters last year.

    产棉区的多数供销合作社在新棉大量上市时采取了“快收、快轧、快运”的工作方法。有些地区的供销合作社还组织流动收购组和物资交流会，便利群众售棉。各地的大多数动力轧花厂也改进劳动组织，开展了提高产量、保证质量的劳动竞赛。各地供销合作社还组织民间轧花车协助轧花。
    据新华社讯　辽宁省新粮已经上市。越来越多的农民每天赶着大车，向国家收购站源源出售新粮。到十月底，全省农民出售的新粮已有六万八千八百多吨。许多农民卖给国家的粮食都经过了挑选、晒干、扬净，质量很好。
    各地粮食部门在接收新粮以前，都做了充分的准备工作。省粮食厅训练了五百多名粮库主任和保管、化验等接收粮食的干部。全省新增设了七百多个粮食接收点，做到了区区有收购机构。
    本报讯　山东省广大农民踊跃向国家售粮。截至十月十四日，国家已收购粮食四亿零七百一十七万多斤，超过去年同期收购数的一倍多。
    湖北省新粮上市量逐日增加。灾区农民把余粮卖给国家更显得特别踊跃。到十月上旬为止，全省农民卖给国家的粮食已达十三亿斤，其中去年受灾地区农民卖的就有八亿多斤。
