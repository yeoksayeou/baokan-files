Developing International Trade Requires Abolishing "Embargoes"
　　Qin Benli

People of all countries urgently demand the removal of artificial barriers to East-West trade, specifically the abandonment of its notorious "embargo" policy by the United States. People expect the Four Foreign Ministers Conference to achieve positive results in resolving this issue, so as to create the necessary conditions for restoring and developing normal international trade and expanding East-West contacts.

The U.S. trade "embargo" policy began to be implemented shortly after the end of World War II and was directed against the entire socialist camp. In 1948, the United States strengthened its control over the export of goods with so-called "military nature" to the Eastern European People's Democracies, and the review of export applications for goods shipped to the Soviet Union and the Eastern European People's Democracies. The United States specifically stipulated a set of special measures for this purpose, which were tantamount to an export embargo.

In 1949, the U.S. Congress passed the "Export Control Act" and established the "Paris Coordinating Committee" to restrict trade with the Soviet Union and the Eastern European People's Democracies. In 1950, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced that special licenses were required for the export of "strategic materials" outside the Americas. After the outbreak of the Korean War, the United States announced that this measure would also apply to our country, and then cancelled all special licenses already approved for the export of goods to our country. Moreover, the export of "strategic materials" to Hong Kong and Macau was prohibited using ordinary licenses, which actually started the "embargo" against our country.

In order to further directly undermine trade with countries in the socialist camp, the U.S. government unilaterally abolished the Soviet-American Trade Agreement which came into effect on August 4, 1937, and announced the cancellation of trade treaties and agreements concluded with Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Bulgaria in 1951.

Moreover, after the U.S. government manipulated the UN General Assembly to pass an illegal resolution smearing our country as an "aggressor" in 1951, it also coerced the UN General Assembly into passing an illegal resolution imposing an "embargo" on China and North Korea. The United States, regardless of the vital interests of other capitalist countries, used U.S. "aid" to force them to take the same action. Only three days after the UN General Assembly passed the illegal "embargo" resolution, the U.S. Congress passed the "Kem Amendment," i.e., the "Foreign Aid Appropriation Amendment." According to this act, the United States would take financial and economic sanctions against those Western European countries that sold "strategic materials" to the socialist camp, and stop providing "aid."

The United States has intensified its trade "embargo" measures against countries in the socialist camp step by step, and the items subject to the "embargo" have become increasingly extensive. In 1951, the United States published a catalog of approximately 1,700 commodities, prohibiting the export of these commodities to countries in the socialist camp. The commodities included in this catalog were very extensive, which was actually equivalent to prohibiting trade between Western European capitalist countries and countries in the socialist camp.

The "Battle Act," passed by the U.S. Congress at the end of 1951, further divided "strategic materials" into direct "strategic materials" and indirect "strategic materials." Violations of the embargo on direct "strategic materials" would result in the immediate cessation of "aid" to the country concerned, while violations of the embargo on indirect "strategic materials" would give the president the power to consider and decide whether to suspend "aid" based on the actual situation. This not only further strengthened the "embargo" measures with threats and pressure, but also expanded the scope of "embargoed" commodities. Thus, oil, transportation equipment, and even some daily necessities were included in the "embargo."

The U.S. trade "embargo" policy has created artificial barriers on the road to normal trade between Eastern and Western countries, damaged the natural, historically formed economic ties between countries, hindered the proper development of East-West trade, and intensified international tensions. According to capitalist countries' press materials, the trade volume between the United States and the current socialist camp countries decreased by nine-tenths in 1951 compared to 1937, the United Kingdom decreased by five-sixths, and France decreased by more than three-quarters. The trade volume between the Federal Republic of Germany and these countries, calculated at 1952 prices, had decreased from US$1,194 million in 1938 to US$119 million in 1952, while Japan decreased from US$1,014 million to US$27 million in 1952.

Recent materials are also sufficient to prove to what extent this trade "embargo" has reduced the possibility of trade development between East and West. According to the "New York Times," in the first quarter of 1955, the United States issued licenses for goods to be shipped to the Soviet Union and Eastern European People's Democracies valued at US$4,986,000, while licenses refused were valued at US$25,925,000. Among the commodities listed as strategic materials that were not allowed to be exported were cottonseed oil, pharmaceutical preparations, and so on.

However, the trade "embargo" did not work as its organizers had hoped. They originally wanted to use the trade "embargo" to hinder the economic recovery and development of countries in the socialist camp, but this plan failed.

The economies of the socialist camp countries are steadily rising, and the total capacity of the new socialist camp market is expanding year by year. This can be seen from some data in the United Nations' recent reports, especially the Economic Commission for Europe's "1954 Economic Survey of Europe," as well as the "1953-1954 World Economic Report" and the "1954 Economic Survey of Asia and the Far East," although these data are not very complete. The total foreign trade volume of socialist countries reached US$20 billion in 1954. Exports account for about half of the total trade value. The growth rate of exports in the socialist world market increased by 300% from 1948 to 1953, an average annual increase of one-third. It is very interesting that during the same period, the capitalist world market only increased by 30%, with an annual growth rate of slightly more than 5%. That is to say, the growth rate of foreign trade in the socialist world market is six times that of the capitalist world market.

It is now obvious that the U.S. trade "embargo" against countries in the socialist camp has not achieved its purpose and has failed. U.S. Foreign Operations Administration Deputy Director Delany, who was responsible for implementing the "Battle Act," had to admit when testifying before the U.S. House of Representatives in 1954 that the "blockade" and "embargo" of the past few years "cannot seriously damage" the economies of the countries in the socialist camp.

Contrary to the wishes of the organizers of the trade "embargo," the trade "embargo" has isolated them from the socialist camp market, damaged the traditional economic ties of their countries, thereby further shrinking the capitalist world market that had already shrunk after World War II, and caused them to suffer more and more serious economic difficulties.

On the eve of World War II, the foreign trade volume of the United States, Britain, and France with the countries now in the socialist camp accounted for 10% of the total trade volume of these three countries, while it accounted for 20% to 25% in Germany, Japan, and Italy. As far as individual commodities such as various types of machinery are concerned, the significance of the socialist camp market is even greater. In addition, the wood, wheat, sugar, and other products imported by Western European countries from the Eastern European People's Democracies accounted for a large proportion. Similarly, before the war, 60% to 65% of Japan's total imported coal, 30% to 40% of iron ore, 60% of salt, and 10% of soybeans and soybean cakes were imported from China. Now, due to the trade "embargo," the capitalist world market has not only lost a vast sales market, but also lost an important source of raw materials and agricultural products.

The result of the trade "embargo" is that many export sectors of industry in many capitalist countries have been drastically reduced, unemployment has increased, and the living standards of the working people have been further reduced. This has made the problem of commodity sales, which is already fiercely competitive in the capitalist world market, particularly acute. Coupled with the United States' one-sided "sell but not buy" trade policy, the export of capitalist countries has encountered greater difficulties, causing an increase in these countries' dollar deficits and strengthening their dependence on U.S. monopoly groups. U.S. monopoly groups also use the difficulties of these countries to shift their own economic crises and strengthen their monopoly of the capitalist world market, thereby causing these countries to suffer greater damage.

Therefore, it is not only industrial countries such as Britain, France, Italy, the Federal Republic of Germany, and Japan that are harmed by the "embargo"; countries that rely on raw material exports, such as Indonesia, Ceylon, Malaya, Thailand, and the Philippines, are also hit. As a result of Britain's following the "embargo" policy, British merchants and manufacturers have lost the opportunity to order hundreds of millions of dollars in recent years; while Sino-British trade volume used to reach US$200 million annually. Due to the one-sided trade relationship between the United States and Japan, Japan's trade deficit with the United States was US$3.4 billion in the eight years from 1946 to 1953. Due to the "embargo" facilitating the manipulation of prices by the United States, by 1954, Indonesia had lost US$1 billion in its main exports such as rubber, tin, and sugar alone, with an annual loss of US$300 million; and this amount is approximately one-third of Indonesia's annual export earnings.

All these facts show that the U.S. trade "embargo" policy only makes the capitalist market more chaotic. More and more people in capitalist countries are beginning to realize the enormous harm that this U.S. policy brings to the national interests of other countries. Therefore, the governments and business people of many countries have expressed increasingly strong dissatisfaction with this policy, and some countries have even broken through the constraints and directly developed and established trade relations with countries in the socialist camp. Former British Labour government Trade Minister Harold Wilson once issued such an appeal: "East-West trade is valuable to our self-reliance plan and important to our hopes for full employment. We must not discriminate against this trade for political hysteria. Many restrictions on East-West trade were unreasonable even in the context of the Korean War. Now, these restrictions are meaningless and should be eliminated."

Even among some more clear-headed politicians and business people in the United States, it is believed that the trade "embargo" is unreasonable. U.S. Senator George, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, recently said: "As long as we have the strange theory that all trade must be prohibited, we are hindering the normal relations between the people of other countries."

The Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the People's Democracies have consistently advocated expanding trade with all countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, and advocate completely eliminating all artificial barriers in international trade. The trade "embargo" policy, which is an important part of the United States' "Cold War," has reached the time when it must be abandoned. This is an important step towards further easing international tensions and is necessary for the development of international trade.

    发展国际贸易必须取消“禁运”
    钦本立
    各国人民迫切地要求取消在东西方贸易上的人为障碍，具体地说，就是要求美国放弃它的臭名昭著的“禁运”政策。人们期待着四国外长会议能在解决这一问题上取得积极结果，以便为恢复和发展正常的国际贸易、为扩大东西方的接触创造必要的条件。
    美国的贸易“禁运”政策是在第二次世界大战结束以后不久就开始实行的，并且是针对着整个社会主义阵营国家的。一九四八年，美国加强了对东欧各人民民主国家出口所谓带有“军用性质”的商品的管制，以及对运往苏联和东欧各人民民主国家出口货物的出口申请书的审查。美国为此特地规定了一套特殊的办法，这种办法简直等于出口禁运。
    一九四九年，美国国会通过“出口管制法”，并成立了“巴黎统筹委员会”，限制对苏联和东欧各人民民主国家的贸易。一九五○年，美国商务部宣布“战略物资”输往美洲以外，须领取特种许可证。朝鲜战争爆发以后，美国宣布对我国也同样适用这个办法，跟着取消了所有已经核准输往我国货物的特种许可证。并且，禁止用普通许可证输出“战略物资”到香港和澳门，这实际上就开始了对我国的“禁运”。
    为了进一步直接破坏对社会主义阵营国家的贸易，一九五一年美国政府片面地废除了一九三七年八月四日生效的苏美贸易协定，宣布取消和波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、保加利亚所订的贸易条约和协定。
    不仅如此。美国政府在一九五一年操纵联合国大会通过诬蔑我国为“侵略者”的非法决议以后，又挟持联合国大会通过一项对中朝两国实行“禁运”的非法决议。美国还不顾其他资本主义国家的切身利益，利用美“援”迫使它们采取同样的行动。在联合国大会通过非法“禁运”决议才三天，美国国会就通过了“肯姆修正法案”，即“援外拨款修正案”，依照这个法案，美国对那些把“战略物资”出售给社会主义阵营国家的西欧各国，将采取财政上和经济上的制裁，停止给予“援助”。
    美国对社会主义阵营国家的贸易“禁运”措施步步加紧，“禁运”的项目也日益广泛。一九五一年，美国公布了大约包括一千七百种商品的目录，禁止这些商品向社会主义阵营国家输出。包括在这个目录中的商品非常广泛，实际上就是等于禁止西欧各资本主义国家和社会主义阵营国家之间的贸易。
    一九五一年底美国国会通过的“巴特尔法”，更把“战略物资”分为直接“战略物资”和间接“战略物资”，违反直接“战略物资”禁运的，立即停止对这个国家的“援助”，违反间接“战略物资”禁运的，总统有权根据实际情况考虑和决定是否应予停止“援助”。这不但进一步用威胁和施加压力的手段加强了“禁运”措施，并且也扩大了“禁运”商品的范围，于是，像石油、运输装备，甚至连一些日用品也属于“禁运”之列了。
    美国这种贸易“禁运”政策在东西方国家之间正常贸易的道路上制造了人为的障碍，破坏了各国之间的自然的、历史上形成了的经济联系，妨碍了东西方贸易应有的发展，并加剧了国际紧张局势。根据资本主义国家报刊材料，美国和现在社会主义阵营各国的贸易额，一九五一年比一九三七年缩减了十分之九，英国减低了六分之五，而法国减少了四分之三还多。德意志联邦共和国和这些国家的贸易额，以一九五二年价格计算，已由一九三八年的十一亿九千四百万美元减少到一九五二年的一亿一千九百万美元，而日本由十亿一千四百万美元减少到一九五二年的二千七百万美元。
    最近的一些材料也足以证明正是这种贸易“禁运”把东西方之间贸易发展的可能性缩小到怎样的程度。根据“纽约时报”的材料，美国一九五五年第一季发出的准许商品输往苏联和东欧人民民主国家的许可证计值四百九十八万六千美元，而拒绝发给的许可证计值二千五百九十二万五千美元。列入战略物资的并不准输出的商品中，竟有棉籽油、药剂制品等等。
    然而，贸易“禁运”并不像它的组织者所指望那样。它们原想用贸易“禁运”来阻挠社会主义阵营国家经济恢复和发展，但是这种打算落空了。
    社会主义阵营国家的经济正在稳步上升，新的社会主义阵营市场的总容量也逐年扩大。根据联合国最近的报告中一些资料，特别是欧洲经济委员会发表的“一九五四年欧洲经济概况”，以及“一九五三—一九五四年世界经济报告”和“亚洲与远东一九五四年经济概况”等报告所提供的资料就可看到这一点，虽然这些资料还不是很完全的。社会主义国家对外贸易额一九五四年达二○○亿美元。输出约占贸易总值的半数。在社会主义世界市场中的输出增长速度，一九四八年至一九五三年增加百分之三○○，平均每年增长三分之一。很有意思的是在同一时期，资本主义世界市场只增加百分之三○，每年增长率略多于百分之五。就是说，社会主义世界市场对外贸易的增长速度为资本主义世界市场的六倍。
    现在已经显而易见，美国对社会主义阵营国家所实行的贸易“禁运”没有达到目的，而遭到破产。负责执行“巴特尔法”的美国援外事务管理署副署长德朗尼一九五四年在美国众议院作证时也不能不承认，几年来的“封锁”“禁运”，“并不能严重地损害”社会主义阵营各国的经济。
    和贸易“禁运”组织者的愿望适得其反，贸易“禁运”使他们自绝于社会主义阵营市场，破坏了他们国家的传统的经济联系，从而使得第二次大战后已经缩小了的资本主义世界市场更为缩小，使自己遭到更多的和严重的经济困难。
    第二次大战前夕，美、英、法三国和现在在社会主义阵营内各国的对外贸易额，占了这三个国家总贸易额的百分之十，而在德国、日本和意大利占到百分之二十到二十五。如就个别商品像各种类型的机械等来说，社会主义阵营市场的意义更大。另外，西欧各国从现在东欧各人民民主国家进口的木料、小麦、糖等都占到很大的比重。同样，在战前日本全部进口的煤的百分之六十到六十五，铁矿的百分之三十到四十，盐的百分之六十，大豆和豆饼的百分之十都是从中国进口取得的。现在，由于贸易“禁运”的缘故，资本主义世界市场不但丧失了广大的销售市场，也丧失了取得原料和农产品的重要来源。
    贸易“禁运”的结果就使得许多资本主义国家工业的许多出口部门急剧缩减，失业人数增长，劳动人民生活水平进一步降低。使得本来就在资本主义世界市场上剧烈竞争着的商品销售问题特别尖锐化。加上美国“只卖不买”的片面贸易政策，使得资本主义各国出口方面遭到了更大的困难，引起了这些国家美元赤字的增长，加强了它们对美国垄断集团的依赖性。美国垄断集团也利用这些国家的困难转嫁本身的经济危机，并加强它对资本主义世界市场的垄断，从而使这些国家遭受了更大的损害。
    因此，不只是像英国、法国、意大利和德意志联邦共和国以及日本这样一些工业生产发达的国家受到“禁运”的损害；像印度尼西亚、锡兰、马来亚、泰国、菲律宾这些依靠原料输出的国家，也遭到打击。由于英国追随“禁运”政策的结果，近几年来就使英国商人和制造商失去了数亿美元定货的机会；而中英贸易额过去曾年达两亿美元。由于美日片面贸易关系，从一九四六到一九五三年的八年间，日本对美国的贸易逆差是三十四亿美元。由于“禁运”便利了美国的操纵压价，到一九五四年，印度尼西亚仅橡胶、锡和糖等主要输出方面就损失了十亿美元，每年损失三亿美元；而这个数目约等于印度尼西亚一年由出口所得的进款的三分之一。
    所有这些事实说明，美国的贸易“禁运”政策只有使得资本主义市场更加混乱。资本主义国家越来越多的人们开始觉察到美国这种政策所带给别国民族利益的那种巨大危害。因此，许多国家的政府和企业界人士对于这个政策都表示了愈来愈强烈的不满情绪，有些国家甚至冲破了约束，直接和社会主义阵营各国发生和建立了贸易关系。英国前工党政府贸易大臣哈罗德·威尔逊就曾发出过这样的呼吁：“东西方贸易对于我们的自立计划是有价值的，对于我们充分就业的希望是重要的。决不能为了政治上的歇斯底里而歧视这种贸易。对东西方贸易的许多限制即使是在朝鲜战争的情况下也是不合理的。现在，这种限制已经没有意义而应该加以消除了”。
    就在美国一些头脑比较清醒的政界和工商界人物中，也认为贸易“禁运”是毫无道理的。美国国会参议院外交委员会主席、参议员乔治最近就说：“只要我们具有认为一切贸易都必须禁止的稀奇古怪的理论，我们就是在阻碍其他国家人民之间的正常关系”。
    苏联、中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家一贯主张在平等和互利的基础上扩大同各个国家的贸易，主张彻底消除国际贸易中的一切人为障碍。作为美国进行“冷战”的重要部分的贸易“禁运”政策到了必须废弃的时候了。这是进一步缓和国际紧张局势的重要步骤，也是发展国际贸易所必需的。
