    A Salute to the Shooting Delegations and Observer Delegation from Various Countries
　　Rong Gaotang, Vice Chairman of the Organizing Committee of the 1955 International Friendship Shooting Competition
    The 1955 International Friendship Shooting Competition is about to be held in Beijing, the capital of the People's Republic of China. We are honored to undertake the task of preparing and organizing this competition, which is the first international sports competition organized in our country. We express our gratitude for the assistance given to us by the Soviet Union's Volunteer Society for Assistance to the Army, Navy and Air Force in the preparatory work, and for the trust and support given by the volunteer societies for support of national defense from fraternal countries.
    This competition is an unprecedentedly grand sports competition held among the countries of the peace, democracy and socialism camp. Invited to participate in the competition are the shooting delegations from the Soviet Union's Volunteer Society for Assistance to the Army, Navy and Air Force, the Polish People's Republic's League of Friends of Soldiers, the Czechoslovak Republic's Volunteer Association for Support of the Army, the Romanian People's Republic's Volunteer Association for Support of National Defense, the Bulgarian People's Republic's Volunteer Association for Support of National Defense, the Korean Democratic People's Republic's Homeland Defense Support Association, and the Mongolian People's Republic, a total of seven shooting delegations, together with the shooting delegation from the Central National Defense Sports Club of the People's Republic of China, making a total of eight delegations. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam has sent an observer delegation.
    Shooting sports have a long history in most of the countries invited to participate in the competition, and have broad mass participation and brilliant achievements. The shooting sports in the Soviet Union have the longest history and the largest mass participation. Poland, Romania and other countries have also made considerable progress since liberation. In Poland, the number of people participating in shooting sports has reached 2.5 million. Shooting sports in Romania and Bulgaria have become popular in factories, farms, schools, and organizations. In Czechoslovakia, shooting sports are also developing. Because the shooting sports in the fraternal countries are built on a broad mass base, a large number of outstanding athletes have emerged, and they have repeatedly won honors for their countries in international shooting competitions. In the 36th World Championships held in Caracas, Venezuela in 1954, the Soviet Union won nine championships in fourteen team events. In the European Championships held in Romania in 1955, the Soviet Union and Romania both achieved excellent results.
    This competition is a friendly gathering of outstanding athletes from the support of national defense volunteer association systems of the participating countries. There are a total of one hundred and forty-two athletes, including three meritorious athletes, thirty-seven master athletes, fifty-one first-class shooters, and two second-class shooters. Among these athletes, three have participated in the World Championships, six have participated in the Olympic Games, and sixty-four have participated in general international championships and maintained or created records, including the Soviet athlete B.P. Perebelin, who has won nine gold medals; the seventeen-year-old Romanian athlete Slanaiski Zaglin, who won the European Shooting Championship prone position, and many record holders. Judging from the above situation, although this competition is only a friendly competition between the support of national defense volunteer associations of various countries, the lineup of members is still very impressive. In terms of age, sixty-six athletes are under the age of twenty-five, fifty-four are between the ages of twenty-five and thirty-five, and a few are over the age of thirty-five. The athletes include workers, farmers, students, professors, doctors, actors, and office workers. From the age and occupation, it can be seen that the shooting sports in various countries have a very broad mass character. Through contact in this competition, athletes will establish deep friendships. Through mutual learning and exchange of experience in the competition, athletes will be helped to further improve their shooting skills, strive for higher records and strive for greater honor.
    This friendship shooting competition is a huge encouragement and driving force for the shooting sports of the People's Republic of China. At present, the shooting sports in our country are still not developed enough among the broad masses of the people; although there has been some development in some cities, it is far from meeting the requirements of sports enthusiasts, and the shooting skills of athletes still need to be further improved. This competition provides us with a good learning opportunity. The rich, advanced organizational leadership and technical experience of the fraternal countries will become an important basis for our country to carry out sports and improve technical levels.
    This competition marks the friendship and unity between the people of peace and democracy countries. The consolidation and unity of the peace, democracy and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is a reliable guarantee for defending world peace.
    Let us warmly welcome the shooting delegations from various countries, and wish the conference a victory and success.

    向各国射击代表团和观察代表团致敬
　　一九五五年国际友谊射击竞赛组织委员会副主席　荣高棠
    一九五五年国际友谊射击竞赛，即将在中华人民共和国首都北京举行。这是在我国组织的第一次国际性运动竞赛，我们以能够承担这次竞赛的筹备和组织任务为光荣；对于在筹备工作中苏联支援陆海空军志愿协会给予我们的帮助和各兄弟国家支援国防志愿协会所寄予的信任和支持表示感谢。
    这次竞赛是和平民主和社会主义阵营各国间所举行的运动竞赛中规模空前盛大的一次。应邀参加竞赛的有苏联支援陆海空军志愿协会、波兰人民共和国战士之友同盟、捷克斯洛伐克共和国支援军队志愿协会、罗马尼亚人民共和国支援国防志愿协会、保加利亚人民共和国支援国防志愿协会、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国祖国保卫后援会、蒙古人民共和国等七个射击代表团，连同中华人民共和国中央国防体育俱乐部的射击代表团，一共是八个代表团，越南民主共和国派来了观察代表团。
    射击运动在应邀参加竞赛的大部分国家中都有较久的历史，并且有广泛的群众性和光辉的成就。苏联的射击运动开展最久，群众性也最大，波兰、罗马尼亚等国也在解放之后有了相当的开展。波兰目前参加射击运动的已达到二百五十万人，罗马尼亚和保加利亚等国的射击运动已普及到工厂、农庄、学校和机关中；在捷克斯洛伐克，射击运动也在开展中。由于各兄弟国家的射击运动建立在广泛的群众基础上，所以大量涌现了杰出的运动员，并且多次在国际性射击竞赛中，为自己的国家争取了荣誉。苏联在一九五四年委内瑞拉加拉加斯举行的第三十六届世界冠军赛中，在十四个集体竞赛项目中，就获得了九项冠军；一九五五年在罗马尼亚举行的欧洲冠军赛中，苏联和罗马尼亚都获得了优良成绩。
    本届竞赛是参加竞赛各国支援国防志愿协会系统的优秀运动员的友谊会师。全体运动员共有一百四十二名，其中有功勋运动员三名、运动健将三十七名、一级射手五十一名、二级射手二名。在这些运动员中，参加世界冠军赛的有三名，参加奥林匹克赛的有六名，参加一般国际冠军赛并保持或创造纪录者有六十四名，其中有曾得过九枚金质奖章的苏联运动员布·普·佩列别林；有获得欧洲射击冠军赛卧射冠军的十七岁的罗马尼亚运动员斯拉耐斯基·扎格林和许多的纪录保持者。从以上情况看，这次竞赛虽然还只是各国支援国防志愿协会间的友谊竞赛，但成员的阵容仍然是很可观的。从年龄上看，运动员二十五岁以下的有六十六名，二十五岁到三十五岁的有五十四名，少数为三十五岁以上的。运动员中有工人、农民、学生、教授、医生、演员和机关工作人员。从年龄职业上可以看出各国射击运动具有极广泛的群众性。通过这次竞赛的接触，运动员之间将建立深厚的友谊。通过竞赛中的互相学习、交流经验，将会帮助运动员进一步提高射击技术，争取更高的纪录和争取更大的荣誉。
    这次友谊射击竞赛，对于中华人民共和国的射击运动，是一个巨大的鼓舞和推动力量。当前，我国的射击运动在广大人民群众中间还是开展得很不够的；在某些城市中虽有些开展，但也远不能满足运动爱好者的要求，运动员的射击技术水平还有待于进一步提高。这次竞赛给我们提供了良好的学习机会，各兄弟国家丰富的先进的组织领导和技术经验，将成为我国开展运动提高技术水平的重要依据。
    这次竞赛，标志了和平民主国家人民间的友谊团结。以苏联为首的和平民主和社会主义阵营的巩固团结，是保卫世界和平的可靠保证。
    让我们热烈欢迎来自各国的射击代表团，并祝大会获得胜利和成功。
