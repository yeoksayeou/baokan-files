Xinhua News Agency, December 12th: The mechanical and chemical industry departments are actively preparing to expand the production scale of agricultural machinery and fertilizer products in 1956, to cooperate with the high tide of the agricultural collectivization movement.

The First Ministry of Machine Building and the Third Ministry of Machine Building have recently held several meetings with the Ministry of Agriculture, the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives and other departments to study the expansion of the production and sales of new-style animal-drawn farm tools. The Chemical Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry has also conducted numerous studies on expanding the production of fertilizers and pesticides next year. According to the preliminary plans of the relevant departments, the production scale of new-style animal-drawn farm tools will be greatly expanded next year, with the production of double-wheeled double-share plows and double-wheeled single-share plows alone increasing by nearly one-fold compared to this year. The production scale of fertilizers and pesticides will also be significantly expanded next year. In addition to a large increase in the output of ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate and "666," the production of phosphate fertilizer by state-owned factories will increase by more than ten-fold compared to this year. At the same time, the pesticide "DDT" will be produced and plans for the production of potash fertilizer will be made.

In order to ensure the realization of the plan to expand production next year, the First Ministry of Machine Building and the Third Ministry of Machine Building are currently actively planning the raw materials and tools required for next year's production, and sending working groups to some major factories to help arrange next year's production plans. In addition to sending working groups to help relevant factories arrange next year's production plans, the Chemical Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry is also stepping up the construction of a potash fertilizer experimental plant so that it can begin producing potash fertilizer next year. In order to ensure and improve the product quality of farm tools and pesticides next year, the First Ministry of Machine Building recently collaborated with relevant departments to further revise and test the drawings of the double-wheeled double-share plow. The Chemical Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry recently sent technicians to Shanghai to study the experience of a private factory in improving the quality of "666", preparing to promote the research results in state-owned factories.

In addition, the Ministry of Geology has made arrangements to expand the scale of phosphate rock prospecting next year, and the iron and steel industry departments of the Ministry of Heavy Industry have also made arrangements to expand the production of steel for agricultural tools next year, in order to adapt to the requirements of increased production of new-style farm tools and fertilizers in the future.

　　积极准备扩大明年农具肥料等的生产规模
    新华社十二日讯　机械工业和化学工业等部门正积极准备扩大一九五六年的农业机械和肥料等产品的生产规模，以配合农业合作化运动的高潮。
    第一机械工业部和第三机械工业部最近都同农业部、中华全国供销合作总社等部门召开过多次会议，研究扩大新式畜力农具的生产和销售等问题。重工业部化学工业管理局对扩大明年的肥料和农药的生产，也作了多次研究。根据各有关部门的初步计划，明年新式畜力农具的生产规模将大大超过今年，其中仅双轮双铧犁和双轮单铧犁就将比今年增长近一倍。明年肥料和农药的生产规模也将显著地扩大，除了硫铵和硝铵、“六六六”的产量有很大增长外，国营工厂生产的磷肥将比今年增长十几倍，同时还将生产农药“滴滴涕”和筹划生产钾肥。
    为保证实现明年扩大生产规模的计划，第一机械工业部和第三机械工业部目前已积极筹划明年生产所需的原材料和工具等，同时派出工作组到一些主要工厂帮助安排明年的生产计划。重工业部化学工业管理局除了派出工作组帮助有关工厂安排明年生产计划外，同时在加紧筹建一座钾肥实验厂，以便明年能开始生产钾肥。为了保证和改进明年农具和农药的产品质量，第一机械工业部最近还协同有关部门对双轮双铧犁进一步地进行了图纸的修订和试验；重工业部化学工业管理局最近派出技术人员到上海研究一个私营工厂提高“六六六”质量的经验，准备将研究结果在国营工厂中推广。
    此外，地质部对扩大明年磷矿勘察规模、重工业部钢铁工业部门对扩大明年农具钢材的生产等，也都进行了安排，以便适应今后新式农具和肥料增产的要求。
