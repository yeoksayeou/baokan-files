Xinhua News Agency, 15th: China's iron and steel industry has successfully trial-produced a large number of new products this year. According to incomplete statistics, more than one hundred new types of steel and steel products have been successfully refined and manufactured from January to October this year. Including the new products successfully trial-produced in the past two years, China's iron and steel industry has successfully trial-produced more than three hundred new products.

The new products successfully trial-produced by China's iron and steel industry this year are all urgently needed by the industrial, transportation, and capital construction sectors. This year, the most new products were trial-produced for the machinery manufacturing industry, including several types of round steel and steel plates for automobile manufacturing. These products will be supplied to the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant for production after mass production. A type of silicon steel sheet, successfully trial-produced at the beginning of this year, is an important material for manufacturing motors and has now been supplied to many units. A type of medium-thick steel plate successfully trial-produced not long ago has very strict performance requirements and is an indispensable material for manufacturing ships. Several types of alloy seamless steel pipes successfully manufactured in the first half of this year have special physical properties compared to ordinary seamless steel pipes and can be used as ball bearings, petroleum cracking pipes, or important structures on machines. The agricultural tool steel successfully trial-produced this year plays a significant role in promoting the mass production of new-style animal-powered farm tools. Farm tools made of this steel are more durable than those made of ordinary steel.

Several types of heavy rails and light rails have been successfully trial-produced for the railway transportation department this year. A new type of heavy rail, recently rolled successfully, is rolled according to the style of a heavy rail rolled in the Soviet Union in 1954. It has a longer service life than the heavy rails produced in China in the past.

Among the new products trial-produced for the capital construction sector this year, there is a giant I-beam steel, which can be supplied for the construction of large factories and bridges. There is also a type of deformed steel bar, which has high internal friction, high strength, and strong tensile force. Using it in construction projects can save more than 20% of steel compared to ordinary steel bars.

Due to the large-scale trial production of new products, the production technology level of China's iron and steel industry has been greatly improved this year, laying the foundation for manufacturing more new products in the future. The technical requirements of the new products trial-produced by various factories this year are much more complex than those trial-produced in the past few years. Many products were successfully manufactured only after repeated experiments with the help of Soviet experts. The motor silicon steel sheet successfully trial-produced by the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant this year began trial production more than two years ago. Because this product has very high technical standards, although it was rolled out at that time, it did not fully meet the requirements. Since then, the broad masses of workers have overcome a series of difficulties in equipment and technology, and after continuous rolling, they have reached the technical standards stipulated by the state. The giant I-beam steel trial-produced by the large rolling mill of Anshan Iron and Steel Company this year is very large. According to the original design of this factory, this product could not be rolled. In order to meet the urgent needs of national construction, Anshan Iron and Steel Company transformed the pass design of the primary rolling mill's primary rolling machine, and the primary rolling mill trial-rolled large-section special-shaped steel billets, creating conditions for the large rolling mill to roll this giant I-beam steel. Afterwards, through the active efforts of the broad masses of workers, this new product was successfully trial-produced.

### 钢铁工业制成一百多种新产品

　　钢铁工业制成一百多种新产品
    新华社十五日讯　我国钢铁工业今年已试制成功大批新产品。据不完全统计，今年一月到十月炼制和制造成功的新品种的钢和钢材共有一百多种。连同过去两年试制成功的新产品在内，我国钢铁工业试制成功的新产品已有三百多种。
    我国钢铁工业今年试制成功的新产品，都是工业、交通运输业和基本建设部门所迫切需要的。今年为机器制造工业试制的新产品最多，其中有几种是制造汽车用的圆钢和钢板，这些产品大量生产后将供应第一汽车制造厂生产用。今年年初试制成功的一种矽钢片，是制造电机的重要材料，现已供应许多单位使用。不久前试制成功的一种中厚钢板，它的性能要求很严格，是制造轮船不可少的材料。今年上半年制造成功的几种合金无缝钢管，比普通无缝钢管具有特殊的物理性能，可以做滚珠轴承、石油裂化管或机器上的重要结构。今年试制成功的农具钢，对于促进新式畜力农具的大量生产有很大作用。用这种钢制造的农具比用一般钢材制造的更加坚固。
    今年为铁路运输部门试制成功的有好几种重轨和轻轨。最近轧制成功的一种新型重轨，是根据苏联一九五四年轧制的一种重轨的样式轧制的，它比中国过去生产的重轨使用寿命要长。
    今年为基本建设部门试制的新产品中，有一种巨型工字钢，它可以供应修建大厂房和大桥梁使用。还有一种螺纹钢筋，它的内摩擦力大，强度高，拉力强，用在建筑工程上可以比普通钢筋节省百分之二十以上的钢材。
    由于大量试制新产品，今年我国钢铁工业的生产技术水平又大大提高了一步，为今后制造更多的新产品打下了基础。今年各厂试制的新产品在技术要求上都比过去几年来试制的要复杂得多，很多产品都是在苏联专家帮助下经过反复的试验才制造成功的。太原钢铁厂今年试制成功的电机矽钢片，早在两年多前就开始试制，因为这种产品技术标准很高，当时虽然轧制出来，还没有完全达到要求。从那时起，广大职工又克服了设备上、技术上一系列的困难，经过不断地轧制，才达到了国家规定的技术标准。鞍山钢铁公司大型轧钢厂今年试制的巨型工字钢非常庞大，按照这个厂原来的设计不能轧制这种产品。为了满足国家建设的迫切需要，鞍山钢铁公司改造了初轧厂初轧机的孔型，由初轧厂试轧大断面的异形钢坯，为大型轧钢厂轧制这种巨型工字钢创造了条件。以后又经过广大职工的积极努力，才试制成功了这种新产品。
