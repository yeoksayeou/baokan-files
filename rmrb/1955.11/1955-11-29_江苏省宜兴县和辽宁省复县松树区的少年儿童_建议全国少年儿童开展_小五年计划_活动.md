Children in Yixing County, Jiangsu Province, and Songshu District, Fuxian County, Liaoning Province, Suggest a Nationwide "Little Five-Year Plan" Campaign for Children
    Children in Yixing County, Jiangsu Province, and Songshu District, Fuxian County, Liaoning Province, recently held children's representative meetings. At the meetings, the children, in order to make more contributions to the motherland, passed a resolution on carrying out a "Little Five-Year Plan" campaign. They also wrote letters to the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, suggesting that children across the country launch a "Little Five-Year Plan" campaign to do something beneficial for the country's First Five-Year Plan.
    In their own "Little Five-Year Plan," the children of Yixing County proposed to do the following: each person should plant two sunflowers each year; every two people should plant and keep alive a tree to green their hometown and school; strive to have every five people raise a hen, with the 95,000 children in the county raising chickens that produce more than 2.2 million eggs each year; each person should collect four taels of scrap metal each year; help farmers accumulate fertilizer, pick grain, eliminate pests and harmful birds, teach their parents and neighbors to read, and save stationery and paper. In addition to proposing to do the above, the children in Songshu District, Fuxian County, also decided, based on local conditions, to collect wild medicinal materials in the mountains and collect various minerals to report mineral deposits to the government.
    Now, the children in these two regions have already taken active steps. The Yixing County Committee of the Communist Youth League receives many letters from children every day, in which they put forward and describe their guarantees, plans, and activities for realizing the "Little Five-Year Plan."

　　江苏省宜兴县和辽宁省复县松树区的少年儿童
　　建议全国少年儿童开展“小五年计划”活动
    江苏省宜兴县和辽宁省复县松树区最近分别举行了少年儿童代表会议。会上，少年儿童们为了给祖国作出更多的贡献，通过了一项关于开展“小五年计划”活动的决议。他们还分别写信给青年团中央委员会，建议全国少年儿童都开展一个“小五年计划”的活动，为祖国的第一个五年计划做些有益的事情。
    宜兴县少年儿童在自己的“小五年计划”中提出要做好下面几件事：每人每年种两棵向日葵；每两个人种活一棵树，把自己的家乡、学校绿化起来；争取做到每五个人养一只母鸡，全县九万五千名少年儿童养的鸡每年生产二百二十多万个鸡蛋；每人每年收集四两废金属；帮助农民积肥、拣粮、消灭害虫害鸟，教给爸爸妈妈和邻居识字，节约文具纸张等。复县松树区的少年儿童，除了提出要做好上面这些事情外，还根据当地条件决定到山上去采集野生药材，搜集各种矿石向政府报矿。
    现在，这两个地区的少年儿童们都已经积极行动起来了。青年团宜兴县委每天都收到许多少年儿童的来信，他们在信中纷纷提出和叙述了自己实现“小五年计划”的保证、计划和活动情况。
