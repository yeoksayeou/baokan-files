Hankou Meat Joint Processing Plant Begins Construction Ahead of Schedule

    The foundation work for the main buildings of China's first new-type meat processing plant—the Hankou Meat Joint Processing Plant—commenced on November 1st, a month ahead of the original schedule.
  This factory is designed according to Soviet standards, and the entire production process is automated. Slaughtering, scraping hair, removing bristles, singeing, evisceration, and decapitation are all done by machine. The internal organs are also separated by machine and sent to various workshops. After the workshops produce semi-finished or finished products, they are automatically sent to the cold storage, and when shipping, the automatic conveyor belt in the cold storage sends them to the train through the insulated platform.
    This processing plant is expected to be put into production within the first Five-Year Plan, and after completion, it can produce dozens of products.

    汉口肉类联合加工厂提前兴建
    我国第一座新型的肉类加工厂——汉口肉类联合加工厂主要厂房基础工程已于十一月一日较原计划提前一个月动工兴建。
  这个工厂是按照苏联的标准设计的，生产过程全部自动化。屠宰、刮毛、拔鬃、燎毛、剖腹、去头等工序，全都是用机器操作。内脏也是用机器把它分成一样一样地送到各车间。各车间制成半成品或成品以后，又自动地送到冷藏库，出货时由冷藏库里的自动传送带，通过隔热月台，送上火车。
    这个加工厂预计可在第一个五年计划内投入生产，建成以后，可以生产几十种产品。
