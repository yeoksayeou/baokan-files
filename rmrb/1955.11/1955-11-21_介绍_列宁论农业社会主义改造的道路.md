　　Introducing "Lenin on the Path of Socialist Transformation of Agriculture"
　　Ding Shouhe
    Recently, the People's Publishing House published "Lenin on the Path of Socialist Transformation of Agriculture," which includes the full text of eight works by Lenin on agricultural cooperation and excerpts from five works. Currently, a nationwide high tide of agricultural cooperation has arrived in our country. At this time, deeply studying Lenin's works is of extremely important significance for guiding and further developing our country's cooperative movement.

    Lenin taught us that transforming agriculture according to socialist principles is an important component of the socialist construction cause. To build socialism, it is necessary not only to implement national socialist industrialization but also to carry out the socialist transformation of agriculture. Socialism is a socio-economic system that unites industry and agriculture based on public ownership of the means of production and collective labor. Lenin said that any socialist cause is out of the question if the impoverished peasant economy is not changed.

    Lenin pointed out more than once that the socialist transformation of agriculture is the most complex and difficult task of the socialist revolution after the working class seizes power. This is because in the industry of Russia at that time, the socialist revolution encountered large-scale industry, while in agriculture, it encountered the scattered small-peasant economy, which predominated in number. Lenin taught that the small-peasant economy is isolated, scattered, conservative, and backward small production, which makes it difficult to apply advanced science and technology and agricultural machinery. It cannot be operated according to planned principles and cannot withstand the blows of natural and man-made disasters. Therefore, relying on the small-peasant economy can never get rid of the predicament of poverty. "If we continue to cultivate our small plots of land as in the past, even if free citizens cultivate on free land, we will still encounter inevitable ruin." Lenin also pointed out that the small-peasant economy is based on the private ownership of the means of production. It constantly, daily, hourly, and spontaneously generates capitalism and the bourgeoisie. As private owners, the peasants spontaneously tend towards capitalism, which runs counter to socialism. However, the peasants are not exploiters, but laborers. "As people who live by their own labor and who have been oppressed by capitalism, such peasants stand on the side of the workers." They recognize and personally experience that the regime led by the working class is much better than the old society, and they hope to take the socialist road. Therefore, after the party and the working class seize power, they must make the laboring peasants abandon the road of rural capitalist development and embark on the socialist road free from exploitation, poverty, and bankruptcy; "to bring the most backward agricultural production into a new orbit, transform it, and transform agriculture from the old-style agriculture of blind operation into agriculture based on scientific and technological achievements."

    Lenin put forward the famous cooperative plan in his many works, especially in his last few very important papers. Lenin's cooperative plan is a brilliant plan for transforming the small-peasant economy according to socialist principles and attracting peasants to participate in the cause of socialist construction. This plan is the most important ideological weapon of the Communist Party in the struggle for socialist victory. It is a great contribution to the treasure house of Marxism and a component of Lenin's overall plan for building socialism.

    The main points of Lenin's cooperative plan are: to establish a strong socialist large-scale industry that can promote the development of the entire national economy and transform agriculture; to initially establish simple and low-level cooperatives to organize scattered small peasants and cultivate their collective habits, and then guide them to turn to large-scale, public collective economy. Lenin's cooperative plan for transforming agriculture is entirely in line with the characteristics of the small-peasant economy. Since the small-peasant economy is scattered, and the peasants have private ownership concepts and conservative habits formed over thousands of years, its transformation must be and can only be gradual. "It is absolutely impossible to do it all at once."

    Lenin believed that general cooperatives, especially agricultural producers' cooperatives, are the only correct way for millions of peasants to easily accept and understand the transition from a scattered individual economy to a collective economy, and from the individual ownership of small producers to the collective ownership of the working people. This is because cooperatives can guarantee the correct combination of the personal interests of peasants with the public interests of socialist construction and ensure that personal interests are subordinate to collective interests. Lenin said: "To be honest, in the period of implementing the New Economic Policy, to fully, widely, and highly cooperate the residents of Russia is all we need, because now we have found the yardstick to combine private interests and private commercial interests with state inspection and supervision, and found the yardstick to subordinate private interests to common interests, which was an unsolvable problem for many socialists in the past."

    Lenin pointed out that the continuous development of socialist large-scale industry is an important condition for realizing agricultural cooperation and the transition of the peasant individual economy to a collective economy. Only when large-scale industry continuously supplies tractors and other agricultural machinery can it establish a material basis for large-scale production for collective farmers. However, the development of large-scale industry and the implementation of socialist industrialization must not be carried out in isolation from agricultural cooperation. If industry is the main brain, then agriculture is the foundation for industrial development, because agriculture is the market for industrial products, the supplier of raw materials and grain, and an important source of export materials necessary for accumulating funds for industrialization and for importing equipment to meet the needs of the national economy. Therefore, the steps of agricultural cooperation must be developed in coordination with the steps of socialist industrialization. Otherwise, socialist construction will encounter great difficulties, and the cause of industrialization cannot be completed.

    Lenin convincingly explained that: under the conditions of the proletarian dictatorship and the worker-peasant alliance, under the condition of guaranteeing the working class's leadership over the peasants, and under the conditions of the existence and development of socialist industry, production cooperation that is organized correctly and includes millions of peasant masses is the means to build a socialist society. Lenin said: "Indeed, the state controls all the large means of production, the proletariat holds state power, the proletariat has formed an alliance with millions of small and smallest peasants, the proletariat's leadership over the peasants is guaranteed, and so on—isn't this all we need to build a completely socialist society through cooperatives, and only through cooperatives...?"

    Lenin not only demonstrated the great role and significance of the cooperative system in socialist construction, but also pointed out some extremely important principles and methods to ensure the smooth development of agricultural cooperation.

    Agricultural cooperation means the fundamental transformation of rural production relations. That is to say, it is necessary not only to eliminate the rich peasant class, but also to make the peasants completely get rid of the old road they have been accustomed to for thousands of years and turn to a new road of socialist development. This is an extremely sharp and complex class struggle. Therefore, in order to make the cooperative movement develop along a healthy road, it is necessary to implement the class line of relying on the poor peasants, consolidating and uniting with the middle peasants, and resolutely opposing the rich peasants. Only by correctly implementing this class line can we truly consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, gradually realize cooperation, and complete the arduous task of socialist transformation of agriculture.

    In leading the movement of agricultural cooperation, the working-class party must adhere to the principle of voluntariness and oppose any coercion. Because developing agricultural cooperatives is precisely a matter that requires the participation of peasants, the fundamental principle of peasant voluntariness advocated by Lenin must be implemented at all times and in all places. Lenin said that it is "impossible and absurd" to use coercive means to "transform" the peasants.

    However, voluntariness is by no means equal to laissez-faire, and by no means means that the party's leadership can be abandoned or relaxed. If it is believed that such a great socialist revolutionary movement as agricultural cooperation can develop in a laissez-faire manner, and the party does not need to actively lead it, it is extremely wrong and absurd, and it violates Lenin's principles. Because if socialism does not occupy the rural positions, capitalism will certainly occupy them; without the party's active and strong leadership, the cooperative movement will not develop, the socialist transformation of the small-peasant economy cannot be completed, socialist construction cannot be carried out, and the peasants will naturally not be able to get rid of the predicament of poverty and bankruptcy. And this is extremely unfavorable to the broad masses of peasants, and therefore, the peasants absolutely do not want it. Therefore, it is necessary to give great enthusiasm and care to the cause of agricultural cooperation, support the socialist demands of the peasants as much as possible, strengthen the party's leadership, and closely combine the party's leadership with the enthusiasm of the masses to organize cooperatives, as Lenin taught.

    Persuasion and education are an extremely important way to promote the smooth development of agricultural cooperation. Lenin pointed out: "Since it is said that voluntary consent must be obtained, that is to say, the peasants must be persuaded, and the peasants must be persuaded in practice," "to bring the conscious socialist struggle into the countryside and awaken the countryside." When persuading and educating the peasants, it is necessary to explain the problems they do not understand with extreme patience, so that they are sincerely convinced; it is necessary to repeatedly publicize the superiority of socialist agriculture and explain the benefits of cooperation, because "unless this meaning is explained thousands of times, we cannot expect the broad masses of peasants to be interested in this issue and begin to specifically test the various ways to realize it."

    The most effective method of persuasion for peasants is example demonstration. Lenin said that peasants are very practical people, so we should show them concrete examples to prove that the cooperative is the best thing. If we only verbally promote the benefits of cooperatives to the peasants, but do not show these benefits in actual work, "then the peasants will not trust our propaganda." Therefore, it is necessary to run the cooperatives well and help the peasants who are experiencing economic difficulties, so that the nearby peasants voluntarily approach the cooperatives. Every cooperative should "actually become the core of consolidating the peasants' belief, so that the peasants believe that this method of collective agriculture that transitions to socialism is a beneficial thing."

    Agricultural producers' cooperatives are a new thing in agriculture, and the state led by the working class must help the cooperatives to promote their development. Lenin pointed out: "Every social system is produced under the financial support of a certain class," "At present, the social system that we should give extra support is the cooperative system." However, Lenin also reminded us that we should always consider that the peasants will not say that the cooperative members are supported by the "official family," and that the difference between them and ordinary peasants is only that they are favored by the "official family." "We must try to be good at proving to the peasants that this new system can actually be realized without the help of the official family."

    In short, Lenin extensively studied all aspects of the agricultural socialist transformation problem. Lenin's brilliant cooperative plan creatively solved the most difficult historical task after the proletariat seized power in theory—leading millions of small peasants onto the road of socialism. Later, this theory was further developed in Stalin's works. Lenin's and Stalin's theory of cooperation is the program for laboring peasants to move towards socialism, and it is the basis of the party's policy towards peasants. Lenin's and Stalin's theory of cooperation enabled the Soviet working class and laboring peasants to form a close alliance, finally defeating capitalism, establishing a powerful socialist agriculture, and building a socialist society, and is now moving towards a communist society.

    The Chinese Communist Party, in accordance with Lenin's principles on the socialist transformation of agriculture and the specific conditions of China, has planned a concrete path for our country to realize the socialist transformation of agriculture. Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, China's agricultural cooperation has greatly developed in the past few years. Comrade Mao Zedong instructed us in the report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation": "At present, the high tide of social reform of cooperation in the countryside has arrived in some places, and will soon arrive in the whole country. This is a large-scale socialist revolutionary movement of more than 500 million rural people, which has extremely great world significance." Comrade Mao Zedong's report profoundly analyzed the current situation of domestic class struggle, sharply criticized the right-leaning errors of those who were frightened by victory in the face of the high tide of cooperation, expounded the historical development law of agricultural cooperation in our country, and gave concrete instructions on the steps and methods of agricultural cooperation throughout the country. The Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party focused on discussing the issue of actively developing agricultural producers' cooperatives and gradually realizing agricultural cooperation throughout the country, and adopted corresponding resolutions based on Comrade Mao Zedong's report. Now the cooperative movement in most parts of the country has developed rapidly and healthily. It can be fully expected that under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, under the policy of "overall planning, strengthening leadership," and with the enthusiastic participation of the broad masses of peasants, the socialist transformation movement in the countryside will surely achieve great victory, and the Marxist-Leninist theory of agricultural cooperation will surely show great ideological power in the rural areas of our country with a population of more than 500 million.

　　介绍“列宁论农业社会主义改造的道路”
　　丁守和
    最近人民出版社出版了“列宁论农业社会主义改造的道路”一书，其中包括列宁关于农业合作化问题的八篇著作的全文和五篇著作的摘录。目前在我国，全国性的农业合作化高潮已经到来，在这时候，深刻地研究列宁的这些著作，对指导和进一步开展我国的合作化运动，有极其重大的意义。
    列宁教导我们，以社会主义原则改造农业，是社会主义建设事业的重要组成部分。为了建成社会主义，不仅必须实行国家的社会主义工业化，而且必须对农业实行社会主义改造。社会主义就是把建立在生产资料公有制和集体劳动之上的工业和农业统一起来的社会经济体系。列宁说，如果不把贫困不堪的农民经济加以改变，任何社会主义事业就无从谈起。
    列宁不止一次地指出，对农业的社会主义改造，是工人阶级夺取政权之后，社会主义革命最复杂最困难的任务。因为在当时俄国的工业中，社会主义革命所遇到的是大工业，而在农业中遇到的却是在数量上占优势的分散的小农经济。列宁教导说，小农经济是孤立的、分散的、守旧的、落后的小生产，难于应用先进的科学技术和农业机器，不能按计划原则进行经营，经不起天灾人祸的打击，因此依靠小农经济永远摆脱不了贫困的境遇，“如果我们继续像过去一样地在我们的小块农地上从事耕作，即使是自由的公民在自由的土地上从事耕作，那我们依然会遭遇到不可避免的毁灭”。列宁还指出，小农经济是以生产资料私有制为基础的，它经常地、每日每时地、自发地产生资本主义和资产阶级。作为私有者的农民，自发地倾向资本主义，这是和社会主义背道而驰的。但是，农民并不是剥削者，而是劳动者。“作为靠自己劳动过活的人，作为受过资本主义压迫的人，这样的农民是站在工人方面的”，他们承认并且亲身体会到工人阶级领导的政权比旧社会好得多，他们希望走社会主义的道路。因此，党和工人阶级在取得政权之后，就要使劳动农民抛弃农村资本主义发展的道路，而走上免于剥削、贫困和破产的社会主义道路；“把最落后的农业生产纳入新的轨道，改造它，并把农业从盲目经营的旧式农业变成建立在科学和技术成就之上的农业。”
    列宁在他的许多著作、特别是在他最后的几篇很重要的论文中，提出了有名的合作社计划。列宁的合作社计划，是按社会主义原则改造小农经济和吸引农民参加社会主义建设事业的天才计划。这个计划是共产党在争取社会主义胜利的斗争中最重要的思想武器，是对马克思主义宝库的极大贡献，是列宁关于建成社会主义总计划的组成部分。
    列宁合作社计划的要点是：建立强大的、能够推动整个国民经济发展并能改造农业的社会主义大工业；起初建立简单的低级的合作社，借以组织分散的小农，培养他们的集体习惯，然后再引导他们转向大规模的、公共的集体经济。列宁的这个改造农业的合作社计划，是完全合乎小农经济的特点的。因为小农经济既然是分散的，而农民又有千百年来所形成的私有观念和保守习惯，所以对它的改造必须是而且只能是逐步的，“要一下子做到是根本不行的”。
    列宁认为，一般合作社，特别是农业生产合作社，是千百万农民最易接受、最易了解的从分散的个体经济过渡到集体经济，从小生产者的个体所有制变为劳动人民集体所有制的唯一正确的道路。这是因为合作社能保证把农民的个人利益同社会主义建设的公共利益正确结合起来，保证个人利益服从集体利益。列宁说：“老实说，在实行新经济政策的时期，使俄国居民充分广泛而高度地合作化，这就是我们所需要的一切，因为现在我们已经找到了把私人利益、私营商业利益与国家的检查和监督结合起来的尺度，找到了使私人利益服从共同利益的尺度，而这点在过去对于许许多多社会主义者却是不可解决的难题。”
    列宁指出，不断发展社会主义大工业，是实现农业合作化，使农民个体经济过渡到集体经济的重要条件。只有大工业不断地供应拖拉机及其他农业机器，才能为集体农民建立起大规模生产的物质基础。但是，发展大工业，实行社会主义工业化，决不能离开农业合作化而孤立地去进行。如果说工业是主脑，那末农业就是工业发展的基础，因为农业是工业品的市场，是原料和粮食的供应者，是为工业化积累资金和为输入设备以满足国民经济需要所必需的出口物资后备的重要来源。所以，必须使农业合作化的步骤和社会主义工业化的步骤相适应地发展。否则，社会主义建设就会遇到极大的困难，工业化事业也就不能完成。
    列宁令人信服地说明了：在无产阶级专政和工农联盟的条件下，在保证工人阶级对农民领导的条件下，在社会主义工业存在和发展的条件下，组织得正确、包括千百万农民群众的生产合作制，就是建成社会主义社会的手段。列宁说：“的确，国家支配着全部大生产资料，无产阶级执掌着国家政权，无产阶级与千百万小农、最小农结成联盟，无产阶级对农民的领导已有保证，等等，——难道这不是我们通过合作社，而且仅仅通过合作社……以建成完全的社会主义社会所必需的一切吗？”
    列宁不仅论证了合作制在社会主义建设中的伟大作用和意义，而且他还指出了保证农业合作化顺利发展的一些极重要的原则和办法。
    农业合作化，意味着农村生产关系的根本改造，这就是说，不但要消灭富农阶级，而且要使农民彻底摆脱其千百年来走惯了的旧道路，而转向一条新的向社会主义发展的大道。这是一场极尖锐复杂的阶级斗争。因此，为了使合作化运动沿着健康的道路发展，就必须执行依靠贫农、巩固地团结中农、坚决地反对富农这样的阶级路线。只有正确执行这一阶级路线，才能真正巩固工农联盟，逐渐实现合作化，完成农业社会主义改造的艰巨任务。
    在领导农业合作化的运动中，工人阶级政党必须坚持自愿的原则，反对任何强迫命令。因为发展农业合作社，正是需要农民参加的事情，所以无论何时何地都必须贯彻列宁的农民自愿这一根本原则。列宁说，采用强迫命令的手段来“改造”农民，“既不可能，而且荒谬”。
    但是自愿绝不等于自流，绝不等于可以放弃或放松党的领导。如果认为农业合作化这样伟大的社会主义革命运动可以自流的发展，党不必去积极领导，那是极端错误和荒谬的，是违反列宁原则的。因为农村的阵地如果社会主义不去占领，资本主义必去占领；如果没有党的积极、坚强的领导，合作化运动就不会发展，小农经济的社会主义改造就不能完成，社会主义建设就不能进行，农民自然也就摆脱不了贫困和破产的境况。而这是对广大农民群众极为不利的，因而也是农民绝对不愿意的。所以，必须按照列宁所教导的那样，对于农业合作化事业给予极大的热情和关怀，尽力支持农民的社会主义要求，加强党的领导，并把党的领导同群众组织合作社的积极性密切结合起来。
    说服教育是推动农业合作化顺利发展的一个极重要的办法。列宁指出：“既然说必须求得自愿同意，也就是说，要说服农民，要在实践中说服农民”，“把自觉的社会主义斗争带进农村，使农村觉醒起来”。在对农民进行说服教育时，必须极其耐心地解释他所不了解的问题，使其心悦诚服；必须反复地宣传社会主义农业的优越性，说明合作化的好处，因为“若不把这个意思千番百次加以说明，我们便不能指望广大农民群众会对本问题发生兴趣，而开始来具体试验实现它的种种办法。”
    对农民最有效的说服方法，是实例示范。列宁说，农民都是很讲究实际的人，因此，我们应当向他们作出具体的例子来证明合作社是最好的东西。如果我们只会在口头上向农民宣传合作社的好处，而不会在实际工作中把这种好处表明出来，“那末农民就不会信任我们的宣传”。因此，必须把合作社办好，并帮助在经济上感到困难的农民，使附近农民自愿接近合作社。每一个合作社都应在“实际上成为巩固农民信念的核心，使农民相信集体农业这种过渡到社会主义去的办法是有益处的东西”。
    农业生产合作社是农业中的一种新事物，工人阶级领导的国家必须帮助合作社，以促进其发展。列宁指出：“每个社会制度都是在一定阶级的财政支持下产生的”，“在目前，我们应该格外地加以支持的社会制度就是合作制度”。但是，列宁也提醒我们，应当经常考虑到，使农民不会说合作社社员是靠“官家”养活的，说他们与普通农民的区别，只在于他们受到“官家”的优待。“要设法善于向农民证明，没有官家帮助，这种新制度实际上也是能够实现的”。
    总之，列宁广泛地研究了农业社会主义改造问题的各个方面。列宁天才的合作社计划，是在理论上创造性地解决了无产阶级夺取政权后一个最困难的历史任务——把千百万小农引上社会主义的道路。以后这种理论又在斯大林的著作中得到了发展。列宁、斯大林关于合作化理论是劳动农民走向社会主义的纲领，是党对农民政策的基础。列宁、斯大林关于合作化理论使苏联工人阶级和劳动农民结成亲密的联盟，终于战胜了资本主义，建立了强大的社会主义农业，建成了社会主义社会，现在并正向共产主义社会前进。
    中国共产党依照列宁关于农业社会主义改造的原理和中国具体情况，规划了我国对农业实现社会主义改造的具体道路。在党中央和毛泽东同志的领导下，几年来，我国的农业合作化已有了很大发展。毛泽东同志在“关于农业合作化问题”的报告中指示我们：“目前农村中合作化的社会改革的高潮，有些地方已经到来，全国也即将到来。这是五亿多农村人口的大规模的社会主义的革命运动，带有极其伟大的世界意义。”毛泽东同志的报告深刻地分析了当前国内阶级斗争的形势，尖锐地批判了在合作化高潮面前被胜利吓昏了头脑的右倾错误，阐明了我国农业合作化的历史发展规律，并对全国农业合作化的步骤和办法作了具体指示。党的七届六中全会着重讨论了在全国范围内积极地发展农业生产合作社，逐步地实现农业合作化的问题，并根据毛泽东同志的报告通过了相应的决议。现在全国绝大部分地区的合作化运动已迅速而健康地开展起来。可以完全预料到，在党中央和毛泽东同志的正确领导下，在“全面规划，加强领导”的方针下，在广大农民群众的热烈参加下，农村的社会主义改造运动，定将取得伟大的胜利，马克思列宁主义的农业合作化理论定将在五亿多人口的我国农村中显示出伟大的思想力量。
