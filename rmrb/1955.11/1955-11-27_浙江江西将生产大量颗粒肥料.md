Zhejiang and Jiangxi to Produce Large Quantities of Granular Fertilizer

　　The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Industry recently decided to build four granular fertilizer processing plants in Hangzhou, Wenzhou, Ningbo, and Jiaxing. All construction of the processing plants will be completed and put into production before the second quarter of 1956. The initial plan is to produce approximately 432,000 dan of granular fertilizer throughout the year, which can supply the needs of 864,000 mu of paddy fields. The granular fertilizer manufacturing plant established in Nanchang City, Jiangxi Province, has recently partially gone into production. It is estimated that after full production, it will be able to supply the needs of 258,000 mu of paddy fields annually.
    Granular fertilizer is made by mixing urban waste, manure, etc., with a certain proportion of chemical fertilizer. It is a chemical fertilizer containing all three elements: nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Due to its high yield, good effect, low cost, and convenient application, granular fertilizer has been enthusiastically welcomed by farmers in various regions.

　　浙江江西将生产大量颗粒肥料
    浙江省工业厅最近决定在杭州、温州、宁波和嘉兴兴建四座颗粒肥料加工厂。加工厂的全部工程将在一九五六年第二季度前完工并开始投入生产，初步计划全年生产颗粒肥料约四十三万二千担，能供应八十六万四千亩水稻田的需要。江西省在南昌市建立的颗粒肥料制造厂最近已部分投入生产，预计全部投入生产后，每年将可供应二十五万八千亩水稻田的需要。
    颗粒肥料是利用城市垃圾、粪尿等和一定比例的化学肥料混合制成，它是一种氮，磷，钾三种元素齐全的化学肥料。由于颗粒肥料的产量高，效果好，成本低，施用方便，受到了各地农民的热烈欢迎。
