Xi'an's newly installed automatic telephone system officially began operation on November 12th. This is a significant event in the lives of the people of Xi'an.

Before 1951, Xi'an only had 1,000 manual telephone lines. These telephones were produced in 1919 and transported from Hankou to Xi'an starting in 1935. Because the equipment was severely outdated and the machinery's performance had greatly diminished, the call quality remained poor despite repeated repairs. After 1951, although Xi'an installed another 1,000 manual telephone lines, it could not keep up with the development requirements of the national construction effort. This year, with the installation of automatic telephones, the situation will fundamentally improve.

The installation of Xi'an's automatic telephones began on July 1st this year and was completed ahead of schedule by October 20th. This equipment is the latest product from East Germany in 1952.

During the installation process, the workers displayed their enthusiasm for labor and also received assistance from experts from East Germany.

### 西安新装自动电话开始通话

　  西安新装自动电话开始通话
    西安市新安装的自动电话已经在十一月十二日正式通话了。这是西安人民生活中的一件大事。
    西安市在一九五一年以前，只有一千门共电电话，这些电话还是一九一九年的出品，一九三五年开始由汉口运到西安来。因为设备破旧不堪，机器性能大大减弱，虽经多次修理，通话的效果仍然不好。一九五一年以后，西安市虽然又安装了一千门共电电话，但是赶不上国家建设事业的发展要求。今年，由于安装了自动电话，情况将有根本的好转。
    西安市自动电话是今年七月一日开始安装的，到十月二十日就提前完工了。这些设备是民主德国一九五二年的最新产品。
    在装机过程中，工人们发挥了劳动积极性，同时得到了民主德国专家的帮助。
