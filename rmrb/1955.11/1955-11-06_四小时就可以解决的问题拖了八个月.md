To the Editor:

    Zhang Zhiqing, a lathe operator in the mechanical workshop of the Zhangjiakou Prospecting Machinery Factory, proposed a rationalization suggestion on January 8th of this year to manufacture a "three-way water gate rotating mandrel" to replace the existing production tools. The workshop leaders and staff thought it was a good idea as it could greatly improve work efficiency. The factory's rationalization proposal review team and the chief engineer also reviewed and approved it, and the factory department approved on January 13th to let the workshop manufacture it themselves. Originally, the workshop only needed to find some scrap material and spend four hours to manufacture the "three-way water gate rotating mandrel"; however, they did not actively implement the factory's instructions, and the matter sank like a stone into the sea without any further development.

    By mid-May, after Zhang Zhiqing's repeated inquiries, the workshop finally drew up the construction drawings, but then pushed the manufacturing task out, asking the production section to hand it over to the tool workshop. The suggestion remained in the production section for about a month. On June 13th, the production section returned it with the reason that "rationalization proposals cannot be manufactured as tools." After repeated negotiations, the factory-level rationalization proposal review team decided to entrust another workshop to manufacture it. On June 16th, this suggestion was sent to the production section again along with the entrusted construction order. However, after a long time, this "three-way water gate rotating mandrel" was still not manufactured. The technical section repeatedly inquired, but Liu, the technician in charge of the tool workshop in the production section, and the chief dispatcher said that they had not received this suggestion at all.

    On July 27th, Deputy Director Zhang Zhizhang wanted to thoroughly investigate the implementation of this rationalization proposal. This is how the suggestion was finally found in the production section's drawer on July 28th; but it was suppressed several times in the forging workshop and tool workshop with the excuse that "production tasks are urgent, and suggestions are not." As a result, the "three-way water gate rotating mandrel" was not officially manufactured until September 1st.

    People can't help but ask: Why did a problem that could be solved in four hours drag on for more than one hundred and forty days?

### 四小时就可以解决的问题拖了八个月

    四小时就可以解决的问题拖了八个月编辑同志：
    张家口探矿机械一厂机械车间镟工张质卿在今年一月八日提出了一件制造“三通水门转动胎轴”代替原有生产工具的合理化建议。这个建议实现以后，可以大大地提高工作效率，车间的领导工作人员认为很好；厂里的合理化建议审查组和总工程师也都审查批准了，并由厂部在一月十三日批示让车间自行制造。本来，车间只要找点废料，用上四个钟头，就可以把“三通水门转动胎轴”制造出来；可是他们却不积极执行厂方的指示，事情就像石沉大海一样没有下文了。
    等到五月中旬，经过张质卿的一再催问，车间里才把施工图纸画出来，但是又把制造的任务推出去，让生产科交给工具车间。这个建议在生产科放了一个月左右，六月十三日生产科又用“合理化建议不能按工具制造”为理由退了回来。经过再三交涉，最后，厂级合理化建议审查组决定委托别的车间制造。六月十六日，这个建议又随着委托施工命令单送到了生产科。可是时间过了好久，这个“三通水门转动胎轴”还没有制造出来。技术科一再追问，生产科负责管理工具车间的刘技术员和总调度却说根本没有收到这份建议。
    七月二十七日，张之钤副厂长要彻底追查这个合理化建议执行的情况。这样，才使这份建议在七月二十八日从生产科的抽屉里找了出来；可是在锻工车间、工具车间里又被“生产任务要紧，建议不忙”的理由压了几次。结果直到九月一日，“三通水门转动胎轴”才算正式制造出来。
    人们不禁要问：为什么一个四小时就可以解决的问题竟拖了一百四十多天呢？　李国志
