The transportation departments of four units under the Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps saved a total of more than 254,000 kilograms of gasoline in four months, from June to the end of September this year.

　　Starting in June this year, the transportation department of this unit launched a fuel-saving competition, on the premise of striving for safety and overfulfilling transportation tasks. A certain unit, in the competition, promoted the method of saving gasoline by advanced worker Dong Fengming, changing the previous situation of fuel deficit. In addition to completing 81.17% of the annual ton-kilometer transportation plan in the past three quarters, it saved a total of more than 133,000 kilograms of gasoline in four months. Zhang Shenglai, a young driver of a certain unit, actively studied methods to save gasoline. His old "GMC" car only consumed an average of 27 kilograms of fuel per 100 kilometers, which was 11 kilograms less than the quota.
