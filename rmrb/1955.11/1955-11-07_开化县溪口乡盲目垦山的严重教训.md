    The Severe Lesson of Blind Land Reclamation in Xikou Township, Kaihua County
    Yao Weilin
    Xikou Township in Kaihua County, Zhejiang Province, is a mountainous area with abundant forests. In 1954, more than 75% of the farmers relied on state grain supplies. However, this township could supply the state with thousands of cubic meters of timber, tens of thousands of kilograms of camellia oil and tea, and large quantities of tung oil and other forestry and special products annually, supporting national industrial construction.
    This year, Xikou Township put great effort into expanding its cultivated land area, with a new planting of 1,275 mu of corn, reducing the township's planned grain supply for 1955-1956 by more than 170,000 jin compared to last year. However, the expansion of grain crop planting area and the increase in yield in this township came at a significant cost. According to a not very complete survey of eight villages in the township, in order to increase the income of the cooperatives this spring, they blindly destroyed more than 810 mu of forest land, totaling more than 250,000 trees, of which more than 70% were mature forests that should not have been felled. At the same time, 128 mu of sapling forests that had been growing for five to eight years were also cut down. If these trees had matured, they could have produced at least 8,300 cubic meters of timber. At an average price of 30 yuan per cubic meter, the township suffered a loss of more than 250,000 yuan. This spring, the township planted 167,000 fir seedlings. At this afforestation rate, it would take two consecutive years of afforestation and then another 25 years to fully compensate for the above loss. Xikou Township has 3,242 people, and the loss from destroying the trees is equivalent to an average loss of about 80 yuan per person. This year, 1,275 mu of new mountain land were reclaimed, and each mu can only produce 120 jin of corn, increasing grain production by only 153,000 jin. If this continues for three years (newly reclaimed land can generally only grow corn for three years), the total grain output value will only be more than 25,000 yuan. That is to say, for every yuan of grain income, there is a loss of ten yuan in forest resources.
    The harm caused by the large-scale slash-and-burn land reclamation in Xikou Township is not only the destruction of more than 250,000 trees, but more seriously, the destruction of production and construction in the mountainous area. In the past, farmers' farming techniques were very sophisticated. This year, due to the doubled expansion of mountain planting area, there was a shortage of labor, which greatly affected field cultivation and fertilization. More than half of the paddy fields in the township were weeded and fertilized only once. In the fifth village, there were more than 300 mu of fields that used to be covered with green grass (cutting green grass is a major measure to increase rice production in mountainous areas), but this year, due to being busy opening mountains and felling trees, 260-270 mu of fields did not implement this practice. If each mu yields 40 jin less of rice, it is equivalent to a loss of more than 10,000 jin of rice. Due to insufficient manpower and the blind expansion of land reclamation area, not only were 415 mu of burned mountain land left uncultivated, but also the sowing and weeding time was delayed for the already cultivated mountain land. The Linong Production Cooperative in Zhan Village destroyed a forest land with seven or eight thousand pine trees after Qingming Festival. Because there was not enough time, they had to give it to the fifth village of Huaqiao Township to cultivate corn.
    The result of blind deforestation and land reclamation has had an adverse impact on soil and water conservation and farmland protection. On June 18th, a night and half-day of heavy rain caused an unprecedented flood in forty years. The flood submerged more than 30 mu of paddy fields by overflowing the embankment in the first village. According to experienced farmers, the main reason for this flood surge was the reclamation of steep mountains (mostly on slopes of 40 to 50 degrees or more) and soil erosion. In the past, the afforestation and forest protection work in Xikou Township was better, and the paddy fields could withstand drought for 30 to 40 days. But this year, things have changed. As soon as it rains, the river water turns yellow. If there are more than ten consecutive sunny days, the mountain gullies will dry up, and many paddy fields will be threatened by drought. This year, several villages reclaimed more than 250 mu of mountains in a place called Chenkeng in the sixth village, making it impossible for a ten-mile-long mountain gully to meet the irrigation needs of the original 125 mu of fields. In the past, it was "ten miles of Tuotou, the gully water flows all year round, and there is no worry about drought"; now, when it rains a little, the flood will overflow, and the gully water will quickly dry up as soon as the weather clears. Fortunately, this year's weather was favorable, and the township's rice was irrigated. But by autumn, the situation had begun to deteriorate. The first and second villages, where the forest damage was the most severe, also experienced the fastest drought development. Last year, late-maturing crops in the fields could withstand drought for 46 days, but this year, they had to be irrigated day and night after only half a month of sunny weather (half a month earlier than last year). There used to be such a saying among the local farmers: "Reclaiming mountains loses fields, digging mountains to fill the sea; open a line on the mountain, and the flat land is washed away!" "Open all the mountain land, and the people will starve to death!" Unfortunately, now people have forgotten this historical lesson!
    The act of destroying forests to grow grain has created a very bad influence among the masses. The forest owners are very dissatisfied when they see their forests being destroyed and not being given reasonable compensation. The cooperative spent a lot of labor to fell fir trees, but many of the timbers were not sold due to non-compliance with specifications and other reasons. Some poor farmers said: "The township asked us to open more mountains early on; but if the felled fir trees cannot be sold, the credit cooperative loan cannot be repaid. It's really a carrying pole without nails at both ends!" Xu Shankui, an old member of another village, said: "Cutting down trees to grow corn is really picking up stones and throwing away gold bars. I think if this continues, life in the mountains will become more and more difficult." The afforestation activists also felt very heartbroken when they saw that more was cut down this year than planted.
    Why did such serious damage to forests occur in Xikou Township? The main reason is that there was a subjective error in the leadership of production in the mountainous area.
    In the late autumn and early winter of last year, a high tide of cooperativization movement appeared in Xikou Township. The number of agricultural and forestry production cooperatives in the township increased from two to seventeen, and the number of farmers joining the cooperatives accounted for more than 85% of the total number of farmers. Due to collective production after organization, there was a surplus of labor, and the cooperatives applied to reclaim barren mountains for grain planting. Thus, the target for mountain opening in 1955 was formulated last December, and the one-sided slogan of "relying on the mountains for food, opening up mountains for food" was put forward. The Kaihua County Forestry Section, which guided the forestry work in Xikou Township, only paid attention to arranging mountain opening and afforestation, and ignored the specific explanation of the principles and policies of forest protection and rational reclamation. Cao Dekui (leader) and You Jiben and others of the work team working in this township were overwhelmed by the mass enthusiasm for running societies and increasing production, and simply considered the production problems of the cooperatives from the current interests of the masses. With the participation of the person in charge of the county forestry section, they made the wrong decision to "cut down sparse forest mountains and convert them into cornfields". They also believed that this measure had "four major benefits": selling fir trees for money in the short term, having grain to plant in the mountains for the first three years, harvesting tung seeds in the next three years, and being able to plant fir trees later!
    Under the control of this erroneous guiding ideology, confusion occurred in the mastery of the slash-and-burn reclamation system. Although the slash-and-burn of each mountain land went through the four procedures of "cooperative application, village cadre certification, township people's committee agreement, and district office approval", in fact, when examining the mountain opening application forms, the township cadres did not seriously inquire about whether it was a barren mountain or a forest mountain, whether it was reclaimable or non-reclaimable, but instead accepted all applications and stamped them as they came. At each township cadre meeting, they only paid attention to inquiring about the progress of mountain opening, but did not check the implementation of the slash-and-burn system. The work team and township cadres were superstitious about percentages. Whichever village had a faster slash-and-burn progress would be praised, and vice versa would be criticized. As a result, the grassroots cadres had the illusion that "the more mountains opened, the better." They saw the phenomenon of deforestation and mountain opening with their own eyes, so they "turned a blind eye."
    From March 16th, Zhan Wenxian, deputy section chief of Kaihua County Forestry Section, was responsible for the work in this township. Not only did he not stop the wrong behavior of deforestation and slash-and-burn reclamation, but he also proposed an additional mountain reclamation plan. And regardless of the specific local conditions, he blindly put forward the slogan of "resolutely striving for grain self-sufficiency" at the township meeting. The township also launched a movement to revise the production increase plan and open mountains for grain planting. As a result, new deforestation phenomena occurred. After learning about the situation of mountain opening and grain planting in Xikou Township, the Kaihua County Development Committee for Mountainous Area Economy and Forestry Section believed that Xikou Township had found the correct way for mountainous area production and commended the township in a circular on April 5, which further encouraged the act of destroying forests in Xikou Township. At that time, the Kaihua County Party Committee did not discover and correct this error in time.
    The deforestation in Xikou Township was also related to the improper implementation of the policy of mountain forests joining the cooperative. When handling mountain forests joining the cooperative last winter and spring, the policy of voluntary mutual benefit was violated. Erroneous practices such as "small fir trees are free of charge, medium-sized trees return the cost, and large trees reduce the remuneration" were adopted, which generally aroused dissatisfaction among the forest farmers. The forest owners believe that "joining the cooperative is the society's business and has nothing to do with me."
    The incident of forest destruction in Xikou Township shows that many rural workers in Kaihua County do not have a correct understanding of the party and the state's policies on mountainous area production and construction. They do not take into account the characteristics and specific conditions of the mountainous area, one-sidedly emphasizing grain production increase, and ignoring forestry production and soil and water conservation work; they only see the immediate interests of the masses and ignore the long-term interests of the country and the people. This incident also shows that in the case of the great development of cooperatives, a comprehensive plan must be made for mountainous area production. Only in this way can the cooperatives find the correct way to tap the potential for increasing production. In order to learn from the lessons, the Kaihua County Party Committee has decided to use this case to educate cadres throughout the county to prevent similar errors from happening again.

    开化县溪口乡盲目垦山的严重教训
    姚维林
    浙江省开化县溪口乡是一个林木很多的山区。一九五四年有百分之七十五以上的农户依靠国家供应粮食；但是这个乡每年能供给国家数千立方公尺的木材，数万斤的茶油、茶叶和大量的桐油等林业产品和特产品，支援国家工业建设。
    溪口乡今年用很大的力量扩大了耕地面积，新扩种玉米有一千二百七十五市亩，使全乡一九五五到一九五六年度的粮食计划供应量比去年减少十七万多斤。但是，这个乡粮食作物播种面的扩大和产量的提高却是付出了重大的代价。根据全乡八个村不很完全的调查，今春为增加合作社的粮食收入，竟盲目毁掉八百一十多亩林山，计二十五万多株树木，其中百分之七十以上是不应该砍伐的壮年林；同时还有成长五年到八年的一百二十八亩幼苗林也被砍掉了。如果这些林木成材，至少可产八千三百多立方公尺木材，以每立方公尺平均价格三十元计算，全乡遭受的损失就有二十五万多元。今春全乡插杉十六万七千株，依照这个造林速度，要连造两年林，再经过二十五年才能完全弥补上面这个损失。溪口乡现有三千二百四十二人，毁掉树林的损失，等于每人平均损失八十元左右。今年新垦一千二百七十五亩山，每亩只能产玉米一百二十斤，共只增加粮食十五万三千斤。这样连续收益三年（新开一块山一般只能种三年玉米），粮食总产值也只有二万五千多元。这就是说，种粮收益一元，毁林就要损失十元。
    溪口乡大规模烧垦毁林所造成的危害，不仅在于毁掉了二十五万多株林木，更严重的是破坏了山区的生产建设。往年农民的耕作技术是很讲究的，今年由于加倍扩大种山面积，发生了劳力不足的困难，致使田间耕作施肥大受影响，全乡有一半以上的水田只耘一次草和施一次肥料。五村有三百多亩田，往年都要割青草铺田（割青草是山区稻田增产的主要措施），可是今年由于忙于开山伐木，就有二百六七十亩田没有实行割青草铺田。如以一亩少收四十斤稻谷计算，就等于损失稻谷一万多斤。由于人力不足和盲目扩大垦山面积，不但剩下烧好的四百一十五亩山无力开垦出来，而且对已开的山地也推迟了播种和锄草的时间。詹村林农生产合作社在清明后毁掉一块有七、八千株松木的林地，因为时间来不及，最后不得不送给花桥乡五村去垦种玉米。
    盲目毁林垦山的结果，对于水土保持和农田保护发生了不良的影响。六月十八日下了一夜和半天的暴雨，就形成了四十年来所未有的特大洪水，一村被洪水漫过堤岸淹没三十多亩稻田。这次洪水暴涨，据老农反映，主要是由于开垦陡山（大都是四、五十度以上的山坡）和山土冲刷而引起的。过去溪口乡的造林护林工作较好，水田抗旱一般可维持三四十天，可是今年就变样了。只要下短短的一阵雨，河水就会变黄，如果连晴十天以上，山沟就会干涸缺水，许多稻田就会受旱灾威胁。今年有几个村在六村的一个名叫陈坑的地方开山二百五十多亩，使得一条十里长的山沟已经无法满足原来一百二十五亩田的灌溉需要了。从前是“十里沱头，沟水长流，旱灾无忧”；现在一下小雨，洪水就会泛滥，天一晴沟水又很快干涸。幸亏今年风调雨顺，全乡水稻方得灌溉。可是到了秋天，情况已开始恶化了。一、二两村林木破坏最多，旱情也发展最快。去年田间晚熟作物能够抗旱四十六天，而今年只晴上半个月就得日夜灌水了（比去年提早半个月）。当地历史上曾经有这样的农谚：“开山失田，挖山填海；山上开一线，平地冲一片！”“开尽山头地，饿死凡间人！”不幸，现在人们竟忘记这个历史教训了！
    毁林种粮的行为在群众中造成很坏的影响。林主看到自己的山林被毁，又未给予合理报酬，很不满意。合作社花费了大批劳力砍伐杉木，但是许多木材由于不合规格等原因没有推销出去。有的贫农说：“老早乡里叫我们多开山；可是砍倒杉木卖不掉，信用社贷款没法还，真是扁担无钉两头脱！”另一个村的老社员徐善奎说：“砍掉树木种玉米，真是拾起石头丢掉金条；我看这样下去，山里会越搞越苦的。”造林积极分子们看到今年砍的比造的多，也感觉非常痛心。
    溪口乡为什么会发生这样严重的破坏林木的现象呢？主要原因是在山区生产的领导方面犯了主观主义的错误。
    去年秋末冬初，溪口乡合作化运动出现了高潮，全乡农林业生产合作社由二个增加到十七个，入社农户占总农户的百分之八十五以上。由于组织起来集体生产，劳动力有剩余，合作社都纷纷申请开荒山种粮。这样就在去年十二月制定了一九五五年开山的指标，提出了“靠山吃山，吃山开山”的片面的口号。指导溪口乡林业工作的开化县林业科，只注意到布置开山造林，忽视具体交代护林和合理开垦的方针政策；在这个乡工作的工作组曹德魁（组长）、尤继本等人被群众性的办社和增产热潮冲昏了头脑，单纯从群众目前利益出发来考虑合作社的生产问题，在县林业科负责人的参与下，作出了“砍掉稀林山改种玉米”的错误决定。他们并且认为这一措施有“四大好处”：眼前杉木出售有钱，头三年种山有粮，后三年可收桐子，以后还可扦杉木！
    在这种错误的指导思想支配下，在掌握烧山开垦制度上就发生了混乱现象。虽然烧垦每块山地都经过“合作社申请、村干部证明、乡人民委员会同意、区公所批准”的四道手续，实际上，乡干部在审查开山申请书的时候，并不认真查问是荒山还是林山、可垦或不可垦等情况，而是来者不拒，见条就盖印照转。在每次乡干部会议上，也只注意查问开山进度，却不检查烧垦制度的执行情况。工作组和乡干部迷信百分比，哪个村烧垦进度快，就受到表扬，反之就会受到批评。这样一来，就在基层干部中造成了“开山越多越好”的错觉，他们亲眼看到毁林开山的现象，也就“一眼睁来一眼闭”了。
    从三月十六日起，开化县林业科副科长詹文宪负责这个乡的工作。他不但不制止毁林烧垦的错误行为，反而提出了垦山追加计划；并且不顾当地的具体条件，在乡的会议上盲目地提出“坚决争取粮食自给”的口号。全乡又开展了修订增产计划和开山种粮的运动。于是新的毁林的现象又发生了。开化县开发山区经济委员会和林业科得悉溪口乡开山种粮的情况后，认为溪口乡的山区生产找到了正确途径，还在四月五日通报表扬了这个乡，这就更加鼓励了溪口乡破坏林木的行为。当时，开化县委对于这一错误也没有及时发现和纠正。
    溪口乡所以会发生毁林的行为，也同执行山林入社政策不当有关。去冬今春在处理山林入社的时候，曾违反自愿互利政策，采取“小杉木无代价，中材归还成本，大材压低报酬”的错误作法，普遍引起了林农的不满。林主认为“入社由社，与我无关”。
    溪口乡破坏林木的事件说明，开化县不少农村工作人员对于党和国家所规定的山区生产建设的方针，还没有正确的理解，他们不照顾山区的特点和具体条件，片面地强调粮食增产，而忽视了林业生产和水土保持工作；他们只看到群众的眼前利益，而忽视了国家和人民的长远利益。这个事件还说明了在合作社大发展的情况下，必须对山区生产作全面的规划，只有这样才能使合作社找到挖掘增产潜力的正确途径。为了接受教训，开化县委已决定用这一事例向全县干部进行教育，以防止类似的错误再发生。
