Soviet Scientific Research and Technological Inventions

    Exploring the Moon
    Flying from Earth to the Moon has always been an unattainable fantasy. But today, advances in science and technology make it possible for humans to travel to the Moon by atomic rocket. The Soviet Union is conducting research in all aspects of interstellar travel. Designs for future spacecraft are already being discussed by Soviet designers.

    For physicists and astronomers, they have already "arrived" at the Moon. They have used particularly powerful radar to receive signals reflected from the lunar surface. Studying the Moon with radio telescopes can correct previously obtained data about the Moon and discover new things. Many observatories and research institutes in the Soviet Union are conducting research on the nature of the Moon according to the general plan formulated by the Planetary Physics Committee of the Astronomical Council of the Soviet Academy of Sciences.

    The results of the research show that the lunar surface does not have the same colors that we have seen in the past on Earth and observed from distant Mars. There is no water on the Moon, and also no - or almost no - atmosphere, and therefore no medium that can cause oxidation and weathering of the soil and rocks.

    The topography of the lunar surface and the characteristics of its rocks are very important for explaining and comparing the sequence of historical periods of the development of the Moon and the Earth. Vast mountain peaks and valley areas spread across the lunar surface. These are traces of local movement and fragmentation of craters on the lunar surface. Craters on the Moon are sometimes as high as seven or eight kilometers.

    After many studies of the Moon, Soviet geologists have compiled the first map and description of the lunar surface using comparative geological viewpoints, explaining the regularity of its development.

    Antarctic Expedition About to Set Sail
    The 12,000-ton ocean-going vessel "Ob", which is being used by the Soviet Antarctic Scientific Expedition, will set sail from the Gulf of Riga for Antarctica in a few days.

    The Soviet Antarctic Expedition will be led by Dr. of Geophysical Sciences, M. Somov. Participants in this expedition will include the Director of the Oceanographic Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Dr. of Geophysical Sciences, Kort, and many people who have worked at polar scientific stations and Arctic expeditions. Scientists with rich experience in oceanographic research who have worked on expeditions in the Pacific Ocean will also become the backbone of the Antarctic Expedition.

    The Soviet Union will establish three scientific research stations here. The sections belonging to the Soviet scientific research station have never been reached by anyone, so there is the possibility of very significant geographical discoveries. No one knows the natural conditions of these places. It can only be assumed that this is a polar plateau, seven thousand to ten thousand feet above sea level, covered with hundreds of feet of ice and snow. The roads here are also blocked by high mountains.

    To get here, the expedition must overcome at least three huge obstacles. The first is the windy and wavy area south of 40 degrees south latitude, where storms and waves will stretch for thousands of miles. The second is the zone of floating ice surrounding the Antarctic region, ten to six hundred miles wide. Finally, there are the huge ice barriers and cliffs, which block the continent and the ocean, making it very difficult to approach the shore and unload supplies.

    Creating Medical Devices Such as "Artificial Heart"
    The Soviet Institute of Surgical Laboratory Equipment and Tools has designed an experimental instrument called the "Artificial Heart." When connected to the blood system, this instrument can perform the function of the heart - transporting blood and nourishing the brain, nervous system, and internal organs. This instrument can be used when surgeons need to temporarily stop the heart from beating and release blood in order to perform heart surgery smoothly.

    The institute has also designed a very small electrical instrument for testing heart blood pressure. This instrument can enter the heart through a vein. Using this instrument, cardiograms can be taken, contrast agents can be placed in the heart to obtain more accurate X-ray images, and the nature of congenital and acquired heart diseases can be determined.

    The institute has also created a hypnotic device. This device can use electric current to make people sleep similarly to normal physiological sleep. The staff of the institute are also creating another similar electrical anesthesia device. Under the influence of this device, the human body can produce an anesthetic sleep, which can be used to perform extremely complex surgeries.

　　苏联的科学研究和技术发明
　　探测月球
    从地球飞向月球从来只是一个不能实现的幻想。但是在今天，科学技术的进展使得人类有可能乘原子火箭飞到月球去。苏联正在进行着有关星际交通的各方面的研究。未来宇宙船的图案已经是苏联的设计家在讨论的问题。
    对于物理学家和天文学家来说，他们更是已经
  “到达”了月球了。他们利用特别强有力的雷达已收到了月面反射的讯号。用无线电望远镜研究月亮，可以校正以前得到的关于月球的资料并发现新的东西。苏联许多天文台和研究所根据苏联科学院天文委员会的行星物理委员会制定的总计划，正在对月球的性质进行着研究。
    根据研究的结果，证明月面并没有像我们过去在地球上所看到的和从遥远的火星上所观察到的那样的颜色。月亮上没有水，同时也没有——或几乎没有——大气，因此，也没有可以使土壤和岩石发生氧化和风化的介质。
    月面的地形及其岩石的特性对于解释和比较月球和地球的发展历史时期的次序，是很重要的。在月面上蔓延着广阔的山峰和山谷地带。这是月面上的环形山局部移动和碎裂的痕迹，月亮上的环形山有时高达七、八公里。
    经过对月球的许多研究，苏联地质学家已经编制了第一部用比较地质学的观点来叙述月面的地图和说明书，解释了它的发展的规律性。
    南极探险队即将启程
    供苏联南极科学考察队应用的一万二千吨重的远洋大航轮“鄂毕号”，再过一些日子就要从里加湾启程远航到南极去了。
    苏联南极探险队将由地球物理学博士米·索莫夫领导。参加这个探险队的将有苏联科学院海洋研究所所长、地球物理学博士科尔特，以及许多曾在极地科学站和北极探险队里工作过的人们。曾在太平洋上从事探险工作的富有丰富海洋学研究经验的科学家们，也将成为南极探险队的骨干。
    苏联将在这里建立起三个科学研究站。苏联科学研究站所属的地段，从来还没有人到达过，因此存在着非常有意义的地理发现的可能性。这些地方的自然情况还没有人知道。只能假想这里是一个极地高原，海拔七千到一万呎，上面覆盖着几百呎厚的冰雪。这里的道路也是由高山封锁住的。
    探险队要到达这里，至少必须越过三层巨大的障碍。首先是南纬四十多度的风浪地区，这里的风暴和波浪地带将长达数千哩。其次是围绕着南极地区的十哩到六百哩宽的浮冰地带。最后是巨大的冰的壁垒和断崖，它们阻断了大陆和海洋，使得靠岸和卸下物资都会感到十分困难。
    创造“人造心”等医疗器械
    苏联外科化验器材和工具研究所设计了一种名为“人造心”的试验仪器。这个仪器在连接到血液系统上时，可以执行心脏的机能——输送血液和滋养大脑、神经系统和内脏。当外科医师为了顺利进行心脏手术而须要暂时使心脏停止跳动和放出血液时，就可使用这种仪器。
    这个研究所还设计了一种测验心脏血压用的极微小的电力仪器。这个仪器能经过静脉而进入心脏。利用这种仪器可以拍摄心动图，可以把显影剂放入心脏以获得更精确的爱克斯光像片，可以确定心脏先天和后天的疾病的性质。
    这个研究所还创造了一种催眠器械。这种器械借助电流能使人睡得和正常的生理睡眠相像。研究所的工作人员还在创造另一种类似的电气麻醉器械。在这种器械的影响下，人体可以产生一种麻醉性的熟睡，从而可以施行极复杂的手术。
