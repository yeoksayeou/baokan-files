　　The Transformation of Shanghai's Private Flour Milling and Grain Industries
　　By Our Reporter Ji Yin
    Shanghai's private flour milling and rice milling industries underwent a city-wide socialist transformation in August of this year. This transformation, guided by the principle of "overall planning and comprehensive consideration," merged the two grain processing industries with different production contents and carried out a thorough economic reorganization in a unified manner, re-arranging production capacity rationally according to the needs of the state. During the reorganization, both industries transitioned from the intermediate form of state capitalism to the advanced form of state capitalism. This is a new method for Shanghai to carry out the socialist transformation of private industry. Through this transformation and reorganization, these two private industries have fundamentally changed their long-standing unreasonable state and have been brought into the orbit of the national plan.
    Why did Shanghai's private flour and rice milling industries adopt the method of merging and reorganizing the two industries to carry out the transformation?
    Products of Old China
    Shanghai's private flour milling and rice milling industries were gradually formed and developed under the socio-economic conditions of old China. The development of the flour milling industry mainly occurred during the First World War. At that time, imperialism was forced to relax its economic aggression against China. Some capitalist countries experienced grain shortages due to the war and needed to import grain. The export of Chinese flour could earn a lot of money. This high profit stimulated the blind development of the flour milling industry in Shanghai. In just a few years, the number of flour mills in Shanghai increased to twenty-seven. At that time, Shanghai exported three to eight million bags of flour annually, selling it from the Nanyang Islands to France, Italy, and England. In the decades after World War I, flour exports decreased, and "foreign wheat" and "foreign flour" from imperialist countries such as the United States were imported in large quantities. Shanghai's flour milling industry became a processing factory for imperialist raw materials. However, before liberation, grain prices rose several times a day, and flour became one of the main items for industrial and commercial capitalists to hoard and speculate. Therefore, the blindly developed and massive flour milling industry relied on this abnormal situation to barely maintain itself.
    The situation of the rice milling industry was exactly the opposite. Shanghai is a city where rice is the staple food, and it is also close to the rice-producing areas of Jiangnan. It originally had the need and possibility to develop the rice milling industry, but Shanghai's rice milling industry was very backward. The reason was that colonial Shanghai was not only a sales market for light and heavy industrial products of capitalist countries, but even the grain market was occupied by imported rice such as "Saigon," "Siam," and "foreign indica." Most of the citizens relied on the supply of imported rice. Therefore, a modern rice milling industry was never formed. Until the time of liberation, there was not even a single rice milling factory with husking equipment.
      One "Can't Get Enough to Eat" and One "Can't Finish Eating"
    After the liberation of Shanghai, the socio-economic structure changed, and the inherent contradictions of these two industries, formed under the socio-economic conditions of the old society, became increasingly exposed. The main contradiction of the flour milling industry was "can't get enough to eat," with a serious surplus of production capacity. Currently, according to normal circumstances, Shanghai only needs 20,000 bags of flour per day, at most 30,000 bags, while the daily output of Shanghai's flour milling industry can be as high as 130,000 bags. In order to alleviate this contradiction, the state adopted the method of transferring wheat from distant places for entrusted processing in the first few years to maintain production. From July 1949 to the end of 1953, due to the unreasonable round-trip transportation of raw materials and finished products, the state lost more than 8.75 million yuan in freight. At the same time, due to low operating rates, high expenses, and high costs, the processing fee for the same 100 jin of wheat was 1.7 jiao higher in Shanghai than in Shandong, Anhui, and other places. The state had to spend more than 1 million yuan more in labor fees in a year. In addition to this economic assistance, the state also helped the flour industry make partial adjustments and transferred some of its productive capacity. However, before this reorganization, there were still four large private factories left: Fufeng, Fuxin, Yutong, and Jiancheng. The daily production capacity of the city's flour milling industry (including state-owned and joint state-private enterprises) was 90,000 bags. In the past, the state took the above measures to temporarily solve the difficulties of the flour milling industry, which was necessary. However, the state cannot and should not carry this "burden" for a long time, which is not only detrimental to the state, but also prolongs the transformation of these enterprises and increases the living difficulties of the workers.
    The main contradiction of the rice milling industry is "can't finish eating": insufficient production capacity, backward technical equipment, dispersed management, and inability to meet the requirements of the state. At present, the production capacity of Shanghai's state-owned and private rice milling factories is only about 60% of the needs of the city's people. The general situation of private rice milling factories is: poor product quality, high costs, and the state has to spend more than 300,000 yuan more in labor fees every year. The rice yield is also generally low. If calculated according to the state-stipulated rice yield, more than 470,000 jin of rice was wasted in 1954 alone. The backwardness of technical equipment makes it difficult to adopt advanced technology in production.
    Implementing "Surgery"
    How can the contradictions between the flour milling industry and the rice milling industry be fundamentally resolved? The staff of the Shanghai Grain Bureau have been exploring for a long time, and the capitalists and workers of the two industries have also thought of many ways. Finally, everyone came to a common conclusion: to fundamentally change the situation of the two industries, a thorough economic reorganization of the two industries must be carried out in a unified manner under the leadership of the socialist economy. Because the contradictions between the flour milling industry and the rice milling industry are fundamental contradictions that arose under the economic conditions of old China. To rationally arrange the production of these two industries and bring them into the national plan, it is necessary to change the old foundation, and it is impossible to arrange production without changing the old foundation. This has already been proven by past facts. The favorable conditions for the unified reorganization of the two industries are: the production technology processes of the flour milling industry and the rice milling industry are roughly similar, and the leading agencies are also unified - the Shanghai Grain Bureau. However, their contradictions are exactly the opposite, so the merger and reorganization of the two industries can just complement each other and make everyone "eat enough."
    The capitalists of the two industries had no determination to thoroughly reorganize the economy of the two industries in the past. They once tried to use their own strength to open up a way out on the premise of preserving the original economic foundation. But the results all failed one after another. In July 1951, the capitalists of the flour milling industry organized a "joint venture" of various flour mills, trying to get rid of the predicament through "joint venture," but it disbanded in less than a year. In 1953, the flour industry capitalists proposed to organize a "joint management" to implement unified production arrangements, unified personnel allocation, and unified use of raw materials to solve the contradiction of insufficient production. This approach is actually a method of "merging the large with the small." Like "joint venture," it cannot solve the fundamental contradiction of overcapacity, nor can it solve the contradictions between capitalists in the merger, and finally it had to be abandoned. The capitalists of the rice milling industry also proposed a suggestion to preserve the original foundation and carry out partial transformation, with several larger factories absorbing small factories to carry out technological transformation. However, the foundation of the rice milling industry is weak, and the industry is unable to solve a series of technical problems. Some active members of the capitalists of the two industries gradually realized from the setbacks that the production of the two industries can only be arranged by implementing a thorough economic reorganization under the leadership of the state.
    In June of this year, after repeated consultations under the leadership of the Shanghai Grain Bureau, an agreement was reached on the unified economic reorganization of the two industries: 1. The flour milling industry will eliminate the surplus production capacity according to the principle of production and sales balance, and merge two of the original four flour mills ("Yutong" and "Jiancheng") with the rice milling industry. The other two ("Fufeng" and "Fuxin") will be jointly operated by the state and private sectors separately. 2. The rice milling industry will merge and reorganize the scattered and backward small rice milling factories into large rice milling factories according to the method of "leading the backward with the advanced and leading the small with the large." Among them, fifteen small rice factories will be merged into two eliminated flour mills to form two large rice milling factories. In addition, two relatively large rice factories ("Southeast" and "Dachu") will be merged into one large rice milling factory. 3. At the same time as the reorganization, the two industries will apply for the joint operation of the entire industry by the state and private sectors, entering the advanced form of state capitalism from the previous intermediate form of state capitalism. The economic reorganization of the two industries is a large-scale and complex economic and political work, involving a wide range of issues. Not only must the state lead the reorganization process, but also after the reorganization is completed and put into production, it must also be led by the state. Only under the leadership of the socialist economy can the complete success of the reorganization be guaranteed, which is very clear.
    This plan for the merger and reorganization of the two industries reflects the state's policy of "overall planning and comprehensive consideration" and also conforms to the common interests of the capitalists and the vast number of workers in the flour and rice milling industries. Most of the capitalists expressed their support for this method. Sun Zhongli, the representative of the flour industry capitalists, introduced to the rice industry capitalists: "Our flour mills have large places, good buildings, many warehouses, and convenient transportation, but the production capacity is surplus, and we have never figured out a good way to solve it. We once wanted to throw this burden to the government, which is of course very wrong. If we had discussed it with you earlier, it would have been better." Chen Xin, the representative of the rice industry capitalists, said: "Our industry has small factories, is scattered, and has narrow warehouses. We want to change the status quo, but we have no way out. The merger and arrangement of our two industries is the best." The workers of the two industries were even more overjoyed. The workers of the flour industry no longer have to worry about insufficient production tasks and reduced wages, which affects their lives; the workers of the rice industry have moved from the low, dark, stuffy, and dusty small workshops to the tall and spacious factory buildings of modern factories.
    The unified reorganization and joint operation of Shanghai's private flour and rice milling industries has been completed before this year's National Day. This transformation is successful, and it provides a good experience for the socialist transformation of private industry. This embodies the necessity of combining the overall arrangement of private industry with economic reorganization. This kind of merger and reorganization can not only be carried out within the scope of an industry, but also within the scope of several industries under suitable conditions. After this merger and reorganization, the production situation of the flour and rice milling industries has undergone fundamental changes: 1. Through this reorganization, the flour milling industry has reduced 34% of its flour production capacity, and has initially solved the problem of serious overcapacity in flour production. The remaining flour mills can achieve "eat enough" by processing according to the current flour demand, and gradually achieve a surplus, ending the long-term loss situation. 2. Through this reorganization, the rice milling industry is equivalent to the state completing a huge technological transformation with a small investment, turning the scattered, backward, and basically manual rice milling industry into a concentrated, advanced technology modern industry, opening up a broad road for increasing production and reducing costs. In the future, rice factories will have the conditions to process according to advanced rice processing methods, and it is estimated that more than 2 million jin of raw grain can be saved every year. In the past, most of the seventeen scattered rice factories were not close to waterways, and most of the hundreds of thousands of jin of rice and rice in and out every day had to be transported by trucks and rickshaws. According to the processing volume of the ten rice factories that are not close to waterways this year, the state will have to spend more than 170,000 yuan more. The three large rice factories after the reorganization have large warehouse capacity and are all located on the banks of the Suzhou River, implementing water transportation, which can reduce the number of transfers of raw grain and finished products. According to the preliminary estimate of the Shanghai Grain Bureau, adding up these large numbers that can be saved, the rice milling factory can reduce costs by about 500,000 yuan and reduce circulation and storage costs by about 200,000 yuan per year. 3. Through the reorganization, people have also achieved "each gets what they deserve." The capitalists and agents of the two industries have been properly arranged for work. In the past, these people were busy running to the bank every day because of the instability of production, and they were exhausted. Now that they are placed in production positions, they can gradually transform them through practical work in the future. After the reorganization of the two industries, there were more than 250 surplus workers. The three rice milling factories decided to add a bran pressing workshop in each factory to use the by-products of rice milling (rice and rice bran) to supply the nearby rural areas as pig feed, so that 150 workers found new jobs (there are still 100 workers who have not yet been assigned). 4. After the implementation of the reorganization and the joint operation of the entire industry, the economic types are simpler than in the past (there are only two types: state-owned and joint state-private), and the number of production units is smaller than in the past (from 21 enterprises to 5 enterprises), and the state can greatly strengthen the management of enterprises. The internal management of enterprises also has the conditions to carry out fundamental reforms, gradually replacing the corrupt capitalist management methods of the past with socialist management methods. Now, various production, financial, and other systems have begun to be established in each factory. 5. The working conditions of the workers have been greatly improved. In addition, the further change in the nature of the enterprise and the stability of production have all improved the workers' enthusiasm for labor. During the preparation for the joint operation, new atmospheres that had never been seen before appeared in the flour mills and rice mills. The Southeast Rice Mill eliminated the phenomenon of failing to complete the sample rice yield and losing rice, which had always been the case. Wang Xiangmao Rice Mill originally planned to save 630 jin of grain in September, but it had more than doubled by the end of the month. Similar situations also exist in various flour mills.
    Although the reorganization and merger of the flour and rice milling industries have been successfully completed, more work needs to be done in the future, especially the organizational construction and system construction after the joint operation, and strengthening the unity and education among the workers of each merged factory. Completing the merger and joint operation is not the end of the work, but the beginning of a more arduous task.

　　上海私营面粉工业和粮食工业的改造
　　本报记者　季音
    上海市的私营面粉、碾米工业，在今年八月间实行了全行业范围的社会主义改造。这次改造是按照“统筹兼顾、全面安排”的方针，把两个不同生产内容的粮食加工工业合并起来，统一地进行了彻底的经济改组，按照国家的需要重新合理地安排了生产能力。在改组中两个行业全部由过去的国家资本主义的中级形式进入国家资本主义的高级形式。这是上海市对私营工业实行社会主义改造的一个新方法。经过这次改造和改组，这两个私营工业从根本上改变了过去长期以来的不合理状态，纳入了国家计划的轨道。
    上海私营面粉和碾米工业为什么要采取两业合并改组的方法实行改造呢？
    旧中国的产物
    上海的私营面粉和碾米工业，是在旧中国的社会经济条件之下，逐渐形成和发展起来的。面粉工业的发展主要是在第一次世界大战期间，当时帝国主义被迫放松了对中国的经济侵略，有些资本主义国家因为战争发生了粮食恐慌，需要粮食进口，中国面粉输出可以赚很多钱，这种高额利润刺激了上海面粉工业的盲目发展，于是上海的面粉厂，不到几年，就增加到二十七家。当时上海每年输出的面粉从三、四百万包到七、八百万包，行销地区从南洋群岛直到法国、意大利、英国。第一次大战后的数十年中，面粉输出减少了，美国等帝国主义国家的“洋麦”“洋粉”大量进口，上海的面粉工业就成了帝国主义原料的加工工厂。但是解放前，粮食价格一日数涨，面粉成了工商业资本家从事囤积投机的主要内容之一，因而盲目发展起来的庞大的面粉工业，依靠这种不正常状况仍然勉强维持下来了。
    碾米工业的情形正是相反。上海是以大米为主食的城市，同时又紧靠着江南产稻区，本来是有发展碾米工业的需要和可能的，但是上海的碾米工业却很落后，原因是殖民地的上海，不但是资本主义国家轻重工业品的推销市场，连粮食市场也被“西贡”、“暹逻”、“洋籼”等各种进口米所占领，大部分市民都靠进口米供应，因而也就始终没有形成近代化的碾米工业，直到解放的时候，竟没有一家有砻谷设备的碾米工厂。
      一个“吃不饱”一个“吃不了”
    上海解放后，社会经济结构发生了变化，这两个在旧社会经济条件之下形成的工业，就日益暴露了它先天性的矛盾。面粉工业的主要矛盾是“吃不饱”，生产能力严重过剩。现在根据正常情况，上海全市每天只要面粉二万包，最多是三万包，而上海面粉工业每天的产量却可高达十三万包。为了缓和这个矛盾，国家在最初几年中曾采取了从远地调来小麦委托加工的办法，以维持生产。自一九四九年七月到一九五三年年底，由于原料和成品的往返不合理运输，使国家损失的运费就达八百七十五万余元。同时因为开工率低，开支大，成本高，同样一百斤小麦，上海的加工费要比山东、安徽等地高一角七分，一年内国家就要多支出工缴费一百多万元。除了这种经济上的帮助外，国家还帮助面粉业作了局部的调整，转业了一部分生产力。但是到这次改组前，尚留下私营阜丰、福新、裕通、建成等四家大型厂，全市面粉工业（包括国营与公私合营企业）的生产能力每日可产粉九万包。过去国家采取上述办法来暂时解决面粉工业的困难问题，这是必要的。但是国家不可能也不应当长期把这个“包袱”背下去，这不但对国家不利，也延长了这些企业的改造，增加了职工的生活困难。
    碾米工业的主要矛盾是“吃不了”：生产能力不足，技术设备落后，经营分散，无法适应国家的要求。目前上海国营、私营碾米厂的生产能力，只达全市人民需要量的百分之六十左右。而私营碾米厂的普遍情形是：产品质量差，成本高，每年国家要多支出工缴费三十多万元。出米率也普遍低，如按国家规定的出米率计算，仅一九五四年内，就浪费了米四十七万多斤。技术设备的落后使得生产中很难采用先进的技术。
    实行“开刀治疗”
    怎样才能根本解决面粉工业同碾米工业的矛盾呢？上海粮食部门的工作人员曾经苦苦地摸索了很久的时间，两业的资本家和职工也想了不少办法，最后大家得出了一个共同的结论：要根本改变两业的状况，只有在社会主义经济领导下，两个行业统一地进行彻底的经济改组。因为面粉工业同碾米工业的矛盾，都是在旧中国的经济条件下产生的带有根本性的矛盾。要合理安排这两个行业的生产，把它们分别纳入国家计划，就必须改变旧有基础，而不可能在旧的基础原封不动的情况下来安排生产。这过去的事实也已经证明。两个行业统一改组的有利条件是：面粉工业和碾米工业的生产技术过程大体上相似，领导机关也是统一的——上海市粮食局，而它们的矛盾却正好相反，因此两个行业合并改组，恰好能取长补短，使大家都能“吃得饱”。
    两个行业的资本家对于两个行业的彻底经济改组，过去是没有决心的，他们曾经企图用自己的力量，在保存原有经济基础的前提下，打开一条出路。但是结果都先后失败了。一九五一年七月，面粉工业的资本家曾组织过各面粉厂的“联营”，企图通过“联营”摆脱困境，结果不到一年即散伙。一九五三年面粉业资本家又提出要组织“联管”，实行生产统一安排，人事统一调配，原物料统一使用，来解决生产不足的矛盾，这种做法实际上是“大并小”的办法，它和“联营”一样，既不能解决生产过剩的根本矛盾，也不能解决合并中资本家相互间的矛盾，最后只好作罢。碾米业的资本家也曾提出了一个保存原有基础实行局部改造的建议，由几个较大的厂吸收小厂合并，来进行技术改造，但是碾米业的基础薄弱，一系列技术问题本行业无力解决。两个行业的资本家中的一些积极分子，从挫折中逐渐认识到了要使两业的生产得到安排，只有在国家的领导下实行彻底的经济改组。
    今年六月间，在上海市粮食局领导下经过一再协商，达成了两个行业统一进行经济改组的协议：一、面粉工业根据产销平衡的原则，淘汰剩余生产能力，把原有的四家面粉厂中的两家（“裕通”、“建成”）同碾米业合并，另外两家（“阜丰”、“福新”）单独进行公私合营。二、碾米业按照“以先进带落后，以大带小”的方法，将分散、落后的小型碾米厂合并改组成为大型的碾米厂，其中十五家小米厂并入两家被淘汰的面粉厂，组成两家大型碾米厂。另外两户原来比较大的米厂（“东南”、“大储”）合并成一家大碾米厂。三、和改组同时，两个行业申请整个行业实行公私合营，由过去中级形式的国家资本主义，进入高级形式的国家资本主义。两个行业的经济改组是一件规模庞大、复杂的经济工作和政治工作，牵涉面很广，问题很多，不但在改组过程中必须由国家来领导，在改组完成投入生产后，也必须由国家来领导。只有在社会主义经济领导下才能保证改组的圆满成功，这一点是十分明白的。
    这个两业合并改组的方案，体现了国家“统筹兼顾，全面安排”的方针，也符合于面粉、碾米业资方和广大职工的共同利益。资本家中大多数表示拥护这个办法。面粉业资方代表孙仲立向碾米业资方介绍说：“我们面粉厂地方大，建筑好，仓库多，交通方便，但是生产能力过剩，一直没有想出个好办法来解决，我们曾经想把这个包袱掼给政府，这当然是很错误的，如果早和你们商量就好了。”碾米业资方代表陈信说：“我们这个行业厂小，分散，仓库狭窄，想改变现状，但是苦无门路，我们两业合并安排是最好也没有了。”两业的职工更是喜出望外，面粉业的职工从此可以不再为生产任务不足而忧心降低工资，影响生活；碾米业职工则是从低暗闷人、灰沙飞扬的小作场，搬进了高大宽敞的近代工厂的厂房。
    上海私营面粉、碾米业的统一改组合营，已经在今年国庆节前完成。这次改造是成功的，它为私营工业的社会主义改造提供了一个良好的经验，这体现着私营工业的统筹安排，必须同经济改组相结合的必要性，这种合并改组不但可以在一个行业的范围内进行，在适宜的条件之下，也可以在几个行业内进行。面粉、碾米两业经过这次合并改组后，生产情况已发生了根本性的变化：一、面粉工业通过这次改组，裁减了百分之三十四的面粉生产能力，初步解决了面粉生产能力严重过剩的问题，留下的面粉厂按照目前的需粉量进行加工，就可以达到“吃得饱”，并且逐步地做到有盈余，从此结束了长期以来的亏损局面。二、碾米业通过这次改组，等于国家花了不多的投资而完成了一次巨大的技术改造，把分散落后、基本上处于手工场作业的碾米业，变成了集中的、先进技术的近代大工业，为提高生产、降低成本开辟了广阔道路。今后米厂已经有条件按照先进的稻谷加工办法加工，一年估计可节约原粮二百多万斤。过去十七家分散的米厂大多不靠近水路，每天进出的数十万斤谷子和米大部要汽车、人力车运输，按今年十家不靠近水路的米厂的加工量计算，国家就要多支出十七万元以上。改组后的三个大米厂，仓库容量大，都靠苏州河边，实行水运，就可以减少原粮和成品的转运次数，据上海粮食局的初步估计，把这些可以节省的大数字加起来，碾米厂每年可降低成本约五十多万元，减少流转保管费用约二十多万元。三、通过改组，人也做到了“各得其所”。两个行业的资本家及代理人都妥善安排了工作。这些人过去因为生产不稳定，天天忙着跑银行，弄得焦头烂额。现在安置到生产岗位上，今后就可以通过实际工作，逐步对他们进行改造。两个行业在改组后，多余了二百五十名职工，三个碾米厂决定每厂添设一个轧糠工场，利用碾米的副产品（稻谷和米糠）供应附近农村作为养猪的饲料，使一百五十名职工找到了新工作（还有一百名职工现在还未分配）。四、实行了改组和整个行业的合营后，经济类型比过去简单了（只有国营和公私合营两种），生产单位比过去少了（由二十一个企业变成了五个企业），国家对企业的管理就能够大大加强。企业内部的经营管理也就有条件进行根本的改革，逐步以社会主义的管理方法来代替过去腐败的资本主义的管理方法。现在各厂已经开始建立各种生产、财务等制度。五、职工劳动条件有了很大改善。再加上企业性质的进一步改变，生产的稳定，这些都提高了职工的劳动积极性，就在筹备合营期间，各面粉厂和碾米厂都出现了从来没有过的新气象。东南米厂消灭了历来完不成试样出米而亏米的现象。王祥茂米厂原订在九月份节约粮食六百三十斤，到月底时已超过一倍。各面粉厂也都有类似的情形。
    面粉、碾米业的改组合并虽已胜利完成，但是更大的工作还要在今后来作，特别是合营后的组织建设和制度建设，加强各合并厂职工之间的团结教育等等。完成合并合营不是工作的结束，而是更艰巨的工作的开始。
