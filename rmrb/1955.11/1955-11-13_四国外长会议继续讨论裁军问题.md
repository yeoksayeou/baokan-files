Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, November 12th: According to TASS, the foreign ministers of France, Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States continued their meeting on the 11th to discuss the second item on the agenda – the issue of disarmament. The meeting was chaired by Molotov.

Molotov announced that after consultations, the four foreign ministers had unanimously decided today to conclude the meeting at the end of the third weekend of the conference work, as originally planned. Then, Molotov invited Dulles to speak.

Dulles first expressed his disagreement with Molotov's comments at the meeting on the 10th regarding Eisenhower's proposal for mutual aerial photography and exchange of military intelligence between the Soviet Union and the United States.

Dulles denied that Eisenhower's proposal was disconnected from the issue of stopping the arms race. He also said that this proposal was a prelude to achieving a reliable disarmament plan.

Dulles pointed out that the French and British governments had agreed to Eisenhower's proposal. He said that if the Soviet Union accepted Eisenhower's proposal, the United States would be prepared to immediately begin negotiations with other relevant sovereign states and with the Soviet Union to expand Eisenhower's proposal and Bulganin's proposal regarding monitoring stations to overseas bases and armed forces of other countries on a mutual basis.

Dulles continued, saying that some people say Eisenhower's plan would increase the danger of war because it would allow some countries to obtain intelligence about the military facilities of other countries, making surprise attacks easier. He believed that the Soviet Union had sufficient intelligence about American military and industrial targets, and the United States was not completely ignorant of Soviet military facilities. Therefore, both sides could launch attacks against each other. But if one knew that the other side was preparing to invade, then it could be prevented. This is the essence of Eisenhower's plan.

Dulles welcomed the Soviet Union's willingness to regard aerial photography as a form of supervision in the final stage of implementing disarmament and banning atomic weapons measures. He said that this was a positive step compared to the Soviet Union's previous position. However, he said that he was very disappointed that the Soviet Union rejected Eisenhower's proposal as the first step in easing tensions between our two countries.

Dulles hoped that the Soviet Union's views in this regard would "change," and then he turned to the Soviet Union's proposals on disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons.

Dulles believed that the shortcoming of the Soviet delegation's proposal was that it was merely a promise. He said that the basic principle of American policy is not to allow American security to be subordinated to unreliable promises and agreements without proper supervision.

Regarding the abolition of atomic weapons, Dulles reiterated that only on the basis of an effective system of mutual inspection and supervision can an effective disarmament system be guaranteed.

Dulles concluded by saying that, based on the reasons he had explained, the United States could not accept the Soviet delegation's proposal.

Pinay then spoke, saying that the Soviet delegation's proposal did not take into account the difficulties on the road to disarmament, which are: the imperfection of technical measures for supervising nuclear weapons and the existence of political differences in determining the supervisory organization and supervisory powers.

Macmillan then spoke, referring to the Soviet proposal regarding the establishment of the level of armed forces for the United States, the Soviet Union, China, Britain, France, and other countries. He said that this level was taken by the Soviet Union from the proposal first put forward by Western countries in 1952. However, at that time, these figures were only put forward on the condition that a universal disarmament agreement, including the destruction of all kinds of atomic weapons, could be concluded. Since then, changes have taken place both technically and politically. Macmillan believed that it is currently impossible to guarantee effective supervision of atomic weapons, and moreover, the conditions necessary for building trust have not yet been formed.

Macmillan insisted that the part of the Soviet proposal concerning the establishment of international supervision of disarmament was vague and uncertain.

Molotov then spoke (separately transmitted). After Molotov's speech, the foreign ministers continued to exchange views on the substance of the issues under discussion.

Pinay said, we believe that a universal disarmament plan cannot be realized today, but this does not mean that we reject disarmament. He said that without effective supervision, effective disarmament is impossible.

Dulles said that Article 5 of the Soviet proposal on the 10th stipulates that effective international supervision should be established for the implementation of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons measures. Bulganin also talked about the importance of supervision and inspection, but the Soviet government's proposal on May 10th also said that any agreement on the establishment of international supervision would only paralyze the vigilance of the people of all countries without creating an atmosphere of trust in international relations. The two are contradictory.

Molotov said that Pinay completely confirmed the comments made by the Soviet delegation on his speech yesterday. He said that while the French government advocates disarmament, it also said that the French government believes that disarmament is impossible to achieve now.

Molotov said that if the four countries all say that a disarmament plan cannot be realized now, even though we hope for disarmament, then who needs the Disarmament Committee? If such a conclusion is reached, it would be tantamount to changing the position we adopted previously.

In response to Dulles's speech, Molotov said that there is no contradiction between Article 5 of the Soviet proposal of November 10, Premier Bulganin's speech, and the Soviet government's proposal of May 10. It is precisely because there is a lack of necessary trust between the major powers at present that the Soviet Union proposes to set up monitoring stations in the first stage in order to ensure the establishment of the necessary trust and the implementation of complete and effective international supervision through a certain stage of development of relations between the major powers and other countries in the future.

The ministers will continue to review the second item on the agenda at the morning meeting on November 12.

### 四国外长会议继续讨论裁军问题

　　四国外长会议继续讨论裁军问题
    新华社十二日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦十二日讯：法、英、苏、美四国外交部长十一日继续开会讨论第二项议程——裁军问题。会议由莫洛托夫担任主席。
    莫洛托夫宣布，四国外交部长今天经过协商后一致决定，按照原订计划在会议工作的第三周末结束会议。然后，莫洛托夫请杜勒斯发言。
    杜勒斯首先表示不同意莫洛托夫在十日会议上对艾森豪威尔关于苏联和美国之间互相进行空中摄影和交换军事情报的建议所提出的意见。
    杜勒斯否认艾森豪威尔的建议同停止扩充军备问题脱节。他还说，这个建议是实现可靠的裁军计划的前奏。
    杜勒斯指出法国和英国政府已经同意艾森豪威尔的建议，他说，如果苏联接受艾森豪威尔的建议，美国就准备立刻同其他有关的主权国家以及同苏联开始谈判，以便在相互的基础上把艾森豪威尔的建议和布尔加宁提出的关于监察所的建议扩大到海外基地和其他国家的武装部队。
    杜勒斯继续说道，有人说艾森豪威尔的计划会增加战争的危险，因为它使一些国家获得另一些国家的军事设施的情报，这样就更容易进行突袭。他认为苏联拥有关于美国军事目标和工业目标的充分情报，美国对苏联的军事设施也不是全然无知。因此彼此都可以互相发动攻击。但是如果知道了另一方在准备进犯，那么就可以防止它。这就是艾森豪威尔计划的实质。
    杜勒斯对苏联表示愿意把空中摄影当作实现裁军和禁止原子武器措施的最后阶段的一种监督形式一点表示欢迎，他说，同苏联以前的立场比较，这是一个积极的步骤，但是他说，苏联拒绝了作为缓和我们两国之间的紧张关系的第一步的艾森豪威尔建议，这使他非常失望。
    杜勒斯希望苏联在这方面的看法会“有所转变”，然后他转而谈到苏联关于裁军和禁止原子武器问题的建议。
    杜勒斯认为，苏联代表团的建议的缺点是，它仅仅是一种诺言。他说，美国政策的基本原则是不允许美国的安全从属于那种不可靠的、没有适当监督的诺言和协议。
    至于废除原子武器的问题，杜勒斯再次表示，只有在有效的相互视察和监督制度的基础上，才能保证有效的裁军制度。
    杜勒斯最后说，根据他所阐述的理由，美国不能接受苏联代表团的建议。
    比内接着发言，他说，苏联代表团的建议没有估计到在裁军道路上的困难，这些困难是：对核子武器进行监督的技术措施不完善以及决定监督组织和监督职权时存在着政治上的分歧。
    麦克米伦接着发言，他谈到苏联提出的关于规定美国、苏联、中国、英国、法国和其他国家的武装部队水平的建议。他说，这个水平是苏联取自西方国家在一九五二年首次提出的建议。但是，当时这些数字只是在能够缔结一个包括销毁各种原子武器在内的普遍裁军协定的条件下提出的。从那时以后，无论在技术方面或是政治方面都发生了变化。麦克米伦认为，目前不可能保证对原子武器实行有效的监督，此外，建立信任所必需的条件也还没有形成。
    麦克米伦硬说苏联建议中关于建立对裁军的国际监督这一部分是含糊的和不肯定的。
    莫洛托夫接着发言（另发）。莫洛托夫发言之后，外交部长们继续就所讨论的问题的实质交换意见。
    比内说，我们认为今天还不能够实现普遍的裁军计划，但这不等于说，我们拒绝裁军。他说，如果没有有效的监督，有效的裁军是不可能的。
    杜勒斯说，苏联在十日提出的建议的第五条规定应对裁军和禁止原子武器的措施的实行建立有效的国际监督，布尔加宁也曾经谈到监督和视察的重要性，但是苏联政府五月十日的建议又说，任何关于建立国际监督的协定，在没有造成国际关系中的信任气氛之前，只会麻痹各国人民的警惕。这两者互相矛盾。
    莫洛托夫说，比内完全证实了苏联代表团对他昨天的发言所提出的意见。他一面说法国政府主张裁军，一面又说法国政府认为现在不可能实现裁军。
    莫洛托夫说，如果四国都说现在不可能实现裁军计划，虽然我们希望裁军，那么谁还需要裁军委员会呢？如果作出这样的结论，那这就等于改变我们以前采取的立场。
    莫洛托夫在回答杜勒斯的发言时说道，在苏联十一月十日建议中的第五条、苏联政府首脑布尔加宁的发言同苏联政府五月十日的建议两者之间，没有任何矛盾。正因为目前在大国之间缺乏必要的信任，苏联才建议在第一阶段设立监察所，以便将来通过大国之间和其它国家之间关系的一定的发展阶段来保证建立必要的信任和实行完全的有效的国际监督。
    部长们将在十一月十二日上午会议上继续审查第二项议程。
