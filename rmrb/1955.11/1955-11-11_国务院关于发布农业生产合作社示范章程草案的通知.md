Notice from the State Council Regarding the Issuance of the Draft Model Charter for Agricultural Production Cooperatives

The State Council of the People's Republic of China, in accordance with the resolution of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, hereby issues the Draft Model Charter for Agricultural Production Cooperatives to the entire country. It is hoped that the People's Committees at all levels above the county level throughout the country will discuss this draft, propose revisions, and solicit opinions from district and township staff and the people. At the same time, it is hoped that agricultural production cooperatives throughout the country will try it out, on the one hand, to promote the development and improvement of the agricultural cooperation movement, and on the other hand, to propose revisions to this draft during the trial process.

The Draft Model Charter for Agricultural Production Cooperatives was proposed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and is a summary of the experiences of the agricultural cooperation movement over the years. It was discussed and basically approved by the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and then the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference organized all the national committee members and National People's Congress representatives in Beijing to discuss it. It was then discussed and unanimously approved by the 20th Plenary Session of the State Council, and finally discussed and unanimously approved by the 24th Session of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and a resolution was passed to submit it to the State Council for nationwide discussion and trial implementation. In each discussion, many revisions were made to the draft to make it more perfect.

The Draft Model Charter for Agricultural Production Cooperatives is formulated in accordance with the Constitution of the People's Republic of China; moreover, it concretizes the provisions on the socialist transformation of agriculture in the Constitution. It will become the action guideline for 500 million farmers across the country, affecting their production and way of life. Therefore, the People's Committees at all levels must conscientiously organize the staff of all departments and people from all walks of life to discuss this draft, and conscientiously organize forces to explain this draft to all district and township staff and local members of agricultural production cooperatives, and guide the cooperatives to try it out.

Currently, farmers all over the country are actively organizing and consolidating agricultural production cooperatives in accordance with Chairman Mao Zedong's instructions in July of this year and the resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in October of this year. The agricultural cooperation movement has entered a high tide. The model charter draft now promulgated is precisely what the current agricultural cooperation movement urgently needs. After careful and detailed discussion by all members, each agricultural production cooperative can try out this charter draft as its own charter, and make supplementary provisions for matters not stipulated or not specifically stipulated in this draft according to its own situation and needs. When any agricultural production cooperative discusses this model charter draft and decides to try it out as its own charter, it must combine it with solving the various problems existing in the cooperative itself, so that the model charter draft serves as a weapon for rectification work. At the same time, the People's Committees at all levels should also take appropriate measures to explain this model charter draft to farmers who have not joined the cooperatives, in order to carry out systematic propaganda and education on agricultural cooperation for them, and listen to their opinions on this draft.

The various opinions put forward by the masses of farmers, staff of state organs at all levels, and people from all walks of life on this model charter draft shall be summarized by the People's Committees of the provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions before the end of March 1956, and reported to the State Council, so that necessary revisions can be made to this draft based on these opinions, and then submitted to the next meeting of the National People's Congress for discussion and approval.

　　国务院关于发布农业生产合作社示范章程草案的通知
    中华人民共和国国务院，根据全国人民代表大会常务委员会的决议，现在把农业生产合作社示范章程草案发布到全国，希望全国县以上的各级人民委员会都对这一草案加以讨论，提出修正意见，并且征求区乡工作人员和人民群众的意见；同时希望全国的农业生产合作社都加以试用，一方面用来推动农业合作化运动的发展和提高。另一方面在试用的过程中对这一草案提出修正意见。
    农业生产合作社示范章程草案，是由中国共产党中央委员会提出的，是多年来农业合作化运动的经验总结。它曾经由中国共产党第七届中央委员会第六次全体会议（扩大）讨论和基本通过，又由中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会组织了所有在北京的全国委员会委员和全国人民代表大会代表进行讨论，又经过国务院全体会议第二十次会议讨论和一致通过，最后经过全国人民代表大会常务委员会第二十四次会议讨论和一致通过，并且决议交由国务院发布全国讨论和试用。在每一次讨论中，都曾经对草案作过许多修正，使它更趋完善。
    农业生产合作社示范章程草案，是根据中华人民共和国宪法制定的；而且，它把宪法中关于农业社会主义改造的规定具体化了，它将成为全国五亿农民的行动指针，影响到他们的生产和生活的方式。因此，各级人民委员会必须认真地组织各部门的工作人员和各界人士，进行对于这一草案的讨论，并且认真地组织力量，向区乡全体工作人员和当地的农业生产合作社社员讲解这一草案，指导各合作社加以试用。
    目前，全国各地农民正在纷纷按照毛泽东主席在本年七月间的指示和本年十月间中国共产党七届六中全会的决议，组织和整顿农业生产合作社，农业合作化运动已经进入高潮。现在公布的这个示范章程草案，正是目前的农业合作化运动所迫切需要的。各个农业生产合作社在经过全体社员认真地详细地讨论之后，都可以试用这个章程草案做为自己的社章，并且根据自己的情况和需要对于这个草案中所没有规定或者没有具体规定的事情，做出补充的规定。任何一个农业生产合作社，在讨论这个示范章程草案并且决定试用它做为自己的社章的时候，都必须同解决合作社本身所存在各种问题结合起来，使示范章程草案作为整社工作的一项武器。同时，各级人民委员会还应该采取适当办法，向没有入社的农民讲解这一示范章程草案，以便向他们进行有系统的关于农业合作化的宣传教育，并且听取他们对这一草案的意见。
    各地农民群众、各级国家机关工作人员和各界人士对这一示范章程草案所提出的各种意见，都由各省、市、自治区人民委员会在一九五六年三月底以前汇总，报告国务院，以便根据这些意见，对这个草案再作必要的修正，然后提请全国人民代表大会下一次会议讨论通过。
                  总理周恩来
                      一九五五年十一月十日
