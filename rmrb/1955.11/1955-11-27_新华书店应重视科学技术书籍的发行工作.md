　　Xinhua Bookstore Should Emphasize the Distribution of Science and Technology Books

　　Editor's Note: The letters from the Production Department of the Fuel Industry Publishing House and reader Li Baozhen reflect the urgent demand of the broad readership for Xinhua Bookstore to fully supply science and technology books, which deserves attention. Doing a good job in the distribution of science and technology books and serving industrial construction is an important task assigned to the book distribution department by the state. One-sidedly believing that science and technology books are too specialized, failing to see the desire of the broad masses to improve their scientific and technological knowledge with the development of the national construction cause, and thus adopting a passive attitude towards distribution work will only make one's work lag far behind the actual needs. It is hoped that Xinhua Bookstore will study this issue in a timely manner and change the current backward state of distribution work for science and technology books.

　　(I) Editorial Comrades:

　　Xinhua Bookstore does not pay enough attention to the distribution of science and technology books. Over the years, we have published a large number of books on coal, electricity, and petroleum industries to meet the needs of national construction. However, readers in many areas have repeatedly written to us stating that they cannot buy books in these fields at their local Xinhua Bookstores. Although some readers have repeatedly asked their local Xinhua Bookstores to find ways to supply them, these requests have not been taken seriously. For example, Fushun Petroleum Plant No. 3 regularly solicits the required number of books from its employees after receiving the "New Book Publication Announcement Catalog" jointly compiled by the publishing house and Xinhua Bookstore, and then contacts the local Xinhua Bookstore. However, the Xinhua Bookstore is not responsible for supplying these books at all. Not long ago, the plant ordered twelve copies of "Petroleum Chemical Experiments" from Xinhua Bookstore. The books were delivered, but they were not notified. By the time they went to buy them, they were already sold out. For another example, Song Peide, an electrician in the Power Section of the Jiangxi Textile Factory, wrote: "I would like to buy some books on electrical engineering, such as various operating procedures, but I can't buy them in Nanchang. I still can't buy them on a business trip to Hankou." Hao Junfang of the Drilling Teaching and Research Section of Beijing Petroleum Institute reflected that the "Petroleum Worker's Handbook" published in July this year was not seen in the bookstore of the Petroleum Institute.

　　Many workers and staff in industrial and mining enterprises find it difficult in their work and study because they cannot buy the science and technology books they need. For example, the Quanxian Power Plant in Guangxi Province wrote that their production work is very abnormal and accidents occur frequently. The main reason is that the technical level of the employees is not high and they lack the necessary scientific knowledge. The employees are very eager to improve their technical level. In order to organize learning, a certain number of technical books are needed, but they cannot be bought at the Quanxian Xinhua Bookstore.

　　Why can't the broad readership buy the science and technology books they need? This is mainly because many local Xinhua Bookstores mistakenly believe that science and technology books are difficult to sell, so they always order as few as possible when ordering from publishing houses. In August this year, our publishing house published the book "Supports for Coal Mining Faces." Before publication, we explained to the Beijing Distribution Office of Xinhua Bookstore that this book is a popular book for coal miners and has been recommended by the National Committee of the China Coal Miners' Union as a book for miners' spare-time study. We hoped that they could increase the number of purchases. Even so, they only ordered 2,000 copies from our publishing house. As a result, although they ordered another 3,500 copies from our publishing house a month later, they still could not meet the needs of the readers. Many readers wrote to say that they still could not buy the book. The Xinhua Bookstores in major areas such as Guangzhou, Kunming, Urumqi, and Ulanhot did not order the book "Operation of Steam Turbines" published by our publishing house in September this year at all. The local Xinhua Bookstore in Wuhan, although there are power plants and the Central China Institute of Technology, did not order even one copy of the "Thermodynamic Equipment Exercise Book." The bookstores in Baoding, Hefei, Nanchang, Ulanhot and other places did not order a single copy of the first volume of the "Boiler Inspection Handbook," and the bookstores in Guangzhou and Nanning only ordered one copy each. In this way, it is no wonder that readers in these places cannot buy books in this field!

　　This situation has also caused the passivity and waste of manpower and material resources in the work of publishing houses, printing plants, and bookstore distribution departments. For example, the second volume of "Electrical Equipment of Power Plants and Substations," published in the second quarter of this year, was reprinted four times in just three months because the number of books ordered by bookstores did not match the actual situation. The book "General Theory of Open-Pit Mining" was ordered one thousand copies in early October and another one thousand copies at the end of the month. The book "Elementary Mining Electrical Engineering" was also printed twice in one month.

　　We believe that Xinhua Bookstore should vigorously improve the distribution and promotion of science and technology books, conduct in-depth surveys of reader needs, and propose realistic order numbers to meet the needs of the broad readership in their work and study.

　　(II) Editorial Comrades:

　　With the development of the national construction cause, the geological exploration team is constantly expanding, and more readers urgently need books on geological science. However, Xinhua Bookstore has an erroneous view of the distribution of science and technology books. They one-sidedly believe that such books are difficult to sell, and are afraid of causing backlog and affecting capital turnover. Therefore, they adopt a passive attitude towards distribution work, resulting in readers not being able to buy the books they need. For example, there are Northeast Institute of Geology and several geological schools in the Changchun area, but there are very few books on geology in the local Xinhua Bookstore. Among the many books published by the Geological Publishing House in August and September, there are several books that the Changchun Xinhua Bookstore did not order at all; some good books that geologists must read, such as "Oxidation Zone of Sulfide Deposits" and "Alteration Wall Rocks and Their Prospecting Significance," also ordered less than ten copies. For another example, in the first half of this year, the mass mineral reporting campaign was being carried out across the country, and the Geological Publishing House published a popular book called "Common Sense of Mineral Reporting"; however, Xinhua Bookstore only ordered 6,000 copies at that time. Less than a month after publication, this batch of books was completely sold out, and many people wrote to request continued supply. As a result, another 4,000 copies were ordered and printed.

　　Xinhua Bookstore should correct this attitude of not paying attention to the distribution of science and technology books and actively try to meet the needs of readers.

### 新华书店应重视科学技术书籍的发行工作

　　新华书店应重视科学技术书籍的发行工作
    编者按：燃料工业出版社生产部和读者李宝珍来信反映广大读者迫切要求新华书店充分供应科学技术书籍的情况，是值得重视的。做好科学技术书籍的发行工作，为工业建设服务，是国家对图书发行部门提出的一项重要任务。片面地认为科学技术书籍太专门，看不见随着国家建设事业的发展广大群众渴望提高科学技术知识的要求，因而对发行工作采取消极态度，只会使自己的工作远远落后于实际需要。希望新华书店及时研究这个问题，改变目前科学技术书籍发行工作中的落后状况。
    （一）编辑同志：
    新华书店对于科学技术书籍的发行工作是很不重视的。几年以来，我们为了适应国家建设的需要，出版了大批有关煤炭、电力、石油工业方面的书籍。但是很多地区的读者不断来信提出他们在当地新华书店里买不到这些方面的书籍。有些读者虽然一再要求当地新华书店设法供应，但是这些要求并没有受到重视。例如，抚顺石油三厂经常在收到出版社和新华书店联合编印的“新书出版预告目录”以后就在职工中征求需要数量，然后和当地新华书店联系，但是新华书店却根本不负责供应这些书籍。不久以前，这个厂向新华书店订购了“石油化学实验”十二册，书运到以后却没有得到通知，去买的时候已经卖光了。又如，江西纺织厂动力科电工宋培德来信说：“我想买一些电气方面的书籍，如各种运行规程，但是在南昌买不到，出差到汉口还是买不着。”北京石油学院钻井教研室郝俊芳来信反映：今年七月出版的“石油工作者手册”，在石油学院的书亭就没有看到。
    许多工矿企业的职工，因为买不到自己所需要的科学技术书籍，在工作和学习上感到很多困难。如广西省全县电厂来信反映：他们的生产工作很不正常，经常发生事故，主要原因是职工技术水平不高，缺乏必要的科学知识。职工们很希望提高技术水平。为了组织学习，需要一定数量的技术书籍，但是在全县新华书店却买不到。
    为什么广大读者买不到所需要的科学技术书籍呢？这主要是因为许多地区的新华书店错误地认为科学技术书籍不好发行，因此在向出版社订货的时候总是尽量少订。今年八月，我社出版了“回采工作面的支架”一书，在没有出版以前，我们向新华书店北京发行所说明这本书是煤矿工人的通俗读物，曾被中国煤矿工会全国委员会推荐作为矿工业余学习的书籍，希望他们能扩大进货数字。虽然如此，他们只向我社订货二千册。结果，一个月以后虽然又向我社订货三千五百册，但是仍然不能满足读者的需要，许多读者来信说还是买不到这本书。今年九月份我社出版的“汽轮机的运行”一书，广州、昆明、乌鲁木齐、乌兰浩特等主要地区的新华书店根本没有订货。“热力设备习题集”一书，武汉虽然有发电厂、华中工学院等，但当地新华书店
  一册也没有订。“锅炉监察手册”第一分册，保定、合肥、南昌、乌兰浩特等地的书店一册也没有订，广州、南宁的书店都只订了一册。这样，难怪这些地方的读者就买不到这方面的书籍了！
    这种情况，还造成了出版社、印刷厂和书店发行部门工作的被动和人力、物力的浪费。例如，今年第二季出版的“发电厂和配电站的电气设备”第二卷，因为书店订货数字不切合实际，竟在短短三个月内提出重印四次。“露天采矿通论”一书，在十月初提出订货一千册，月底又提出续印一千册。“初级矿山电工学”一书，也是在一月内印刷两次。
    我们认为，新华书店应该大力改进科学技术书籍的发行推广工作，深入调查读者需要，提出切合实际的订货数字，以满足广大读者在工作和学习上的需要。燃料工业出版社生产部
      （二）编辑同志：
    随着国家建设事业的发展，地质勘探队伍不断扩大，就有更多的读者迫切需要有关地质科学方面的书籍。但是，新华书店对科学技术书籍的发行工作却存在着一种错误看法。他们片面地认为这类书籍不好销，深怕造成积压，影响资金流转，因而对发行工作抱着消极态度，结果就使读者买不到需要的书籍。例如，长春地区有东北地质学院和好几个地质学校，但是在当地新华书店里地质方面书籍却很少。地质出版社八、九月份所出版的很多种图书中，有几种书长春新华书店一本都没有订；一些地质人员必读的好书，如“硫化矿床氧化带”和“蚀变围岩及其找矿意义”等，也只订了不到十本。又如，今年上半年，全国各地正在开展群众报矿运动，地质出版社出版了一本题目叫“报矿常识”的通俗读物；但是当时新华书店只订六千册。出版后不到一个月，这批书就完全销售完了，还有不少人来信要求继续供应。结果又订印了四千册。
    新华书店应该纠正这种不重视科学技术书籍的发行工作的态度，积极设法满足读者的需要。
