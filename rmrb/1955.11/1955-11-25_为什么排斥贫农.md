In the cooperativization plan of the Beitian Township Party Branch in Yuci County, Shanxi Province, it was determined that the Zhanghu Village branch should establish a new cooperative mainly based on the Zhang Jiabao and Zhang Sini mutual aid teams, which actively requested to join the cooperative. However, the Zhanghu Village branch did not follow this plan and only extracted the middle peasants from these two mutual aid teams to form a cooperative. Therefore, this cooperative was entirely composed of middle peasants. The sixteen poor peasant households left outside the cooperative faced many difficulties in both production and life. They said, "Poor peasants in other villages have embarked on the happy socialist road, but our difficulties are increasing."

Were these poor peasants not determined to join the cooperative? Not at all. To join the cooperative, poor peasant Zhang Sini went to the branch's cadres and cooperative organizers every day. Poor peasants Shi Huiman, Shi Yucuan, and others applied to join the cooperative four or five times, but were rejected. The party's leading organs should investigate the leaders of this branch and ask them why they are so determined to exclude poor peasants from joining the cooperative? Why not act in accordance with the township branch's plan?

　　为什么排斥贫农
    山西省榆次县北田乡党支部的合作化规划中，确定张胡村分支部应该以积极要求转社的张甲保、张四妮两个互助组为主建立新社。但是张胡村的分支部并不按照这个规划去办，单把这两个互助组里的中农抽出来组织了一个合作社。所以这个社全部是中农。留在社外的十六户贫农，不论生产和生活上都有很多困难。他们说：“其他村的贫农走上了幸福的社会主义道路，就是咱们的困难越来越大。”
    是不是这些贫农不坚决要求入社呢？完全不是，为了入社，贫农张四妮每天都去找支部的干部和办社干部。贫农石会蛮、石玉川等申请入社也有四、五次，都被拒绝吸收。党的领导机关应该查问这个分支部的领导人员，问他们为什么这样坚决排斥贫农入社？为什么不按照乡支部的规划办事？
