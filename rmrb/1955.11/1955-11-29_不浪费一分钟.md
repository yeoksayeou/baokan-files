　　Not Wasting a Minute
　　Zhou Zuoxin
    In June, when the targets for increasing production and practicing economy were announced, the leading staff of the Second Mechanical Workshop of the Dalian Machine Tool Plant were startled: the production task suddenly jumped from processing forty sets of parts for the 1Д62 lathe per month to sixty sets. Consequently, everyone clamored, "There's just no way to do it!"
    In the past, processing forty sets of parts was not easy, requiring frequent overtime and crash work, especially towards the end of the month. Now, with an increase of one-third in the task, how could they possibly cope?
    The determination of the plant's leadership and staff remained unshaken. The plant's Party organization required the workshop's Party members to exert all their strength to ensure the completion of this task.
    The workshop's Party branch committee held several meetings in a row, first criticizing those who complained, because they only saw the need for overtime and crash work, and were unclear about whether there was any potential strength in the workshop.
    The ideological struggle of Zou Yongji, the workshop director, was very intense, because he would bear the main responsibility for whether the increase in production task could be completed. However, he thought: could the technical level of the workers and the management of the workshop be improved all at once? He had complained about the difficulties and been criticized, and although he no longer blamed the leadership for "making excessive demands," he felt unsure in his heart and did not know what to do. He finally decided to get to the bottom of things and first asked the work efficiency surveyor, Lu Yunbao, to measure the effective working hours.
    Lu Yunbao stood between the gear group and the shaft group, measuring seven people at the same time. Although these seven people were not intentionally selected, they were generally more proactive. Lu Yunbao's measurement form was very detailed, recording each person's work every minute. At exactly 8:10 AM, Lu Yunbao drew the first symbol for the lathe operator Wang Mingyou on the form; at 8:58 AM, this lathe operator went to the inspector to discuss the quality of the work; at exactly 9:00 AM, he started working again; at 9:16 AM, Wang Mingyou prepared for the next batch of work, borrowing drawings and sharpening tools, until 9:30 AM, when he officially started the machine; after the machine only ran for eight minutes, Wang Mingyou went to the inspector to get an inspection stamp; six minutes later, he started working again, and continued until the lunch break.
    Lu Yunbao recorded Wang Mingyou's work situation for 350 minutes, but the actual time the lathe operator ran the machine was only 297 minutes. The remaining 53 minutes were spent on borrowing drawings, sharpening tools, and getting inspection stamps. In less than six hours of work, nearly one hour was wasted. The situation of the other six people measured by Lu Yunbao was even worse. Wen Zhengzhong only worked for 245 minutes out of 350 minutes; Xue Weifa worked for 266 minutes; Leng Baojiu worked for 282 minutes...
    Lu Yunbao handed this data to Zou Yongji, and the workshop director was greatly surprised. He knew that there was waste in working hours, but he did not expect it to be so much! He calculated that, extrapolating from this data to the entire workshop, 3,300 working hours were wasted each month! How many parts could be processed in that time! He realized that complaining about difficulties in the past was completely unjustified, and he also felt that being unsure in his heart in the past was simply dereliction of duty. This data increased his confidence and strength. Together with Liang Yungong, the deputy director of the workshop, he formulated an improvement plan targeting the main reasons for the waste of working hours: borrowing drawings, sharpening tools, and getting inspection stamps, and submitted it to the workshop's Party branch committee for discussion. The improvement plan was very simple: drawings should not be borrowed by workers after receiving tasks, but should be sent down together with the task assignment; tools should no longer be sent to the tool grinding room by the workers, but should be picked up by the tool grinding workers, and returned after grinding; inspection stamps should also not require workers to find the inspectors; when doing batches of small jobs, a standard inspection stamp should be used, and for large jobs or individual jobs, the inspectors should take the initiative to go to the machine tool to inspect.
    After discussion, the improvement plan was implemented from July 15th.
    Zou Yongji and Liang Yungong first approached Yan Tingjie, the tool grinding worker, intending to get his ideological buy-in, because tool grinding workers in the past had always sat in the tool grinding room, grinding for whoever sent the tool. Now, they wanted him to pick up the tools from the workers and send them back after grinding, which would inevitably cause him to resist. However, Yan Tingjie did not think that way. After listening to the two directors' opinions, he readily said, "This is a good method. In the past, when no one came to grind tools, I just sat there; when many people were crowded together, I also lined them up one by one, which was wasteful! Now, if I pick up and deliver, I can free up time!" In less than two days, Yan Tingjie created a cycle tool grinding method, picking up and delivering cyclically among the various groups in the workshop, so that everyone had tools to use and no one was delayed. Zou Yongji and Liang Yungong also approached Lu Deyong, the inspection team leader, to discuss improving inspection work. Lu Deyong also agreed, saying, "We guarantee to do inspections in a timely manner!" When workers were doing important work in the past, they always looked for inspectors every few minutes. Now, the inspectors often stood next to the lathe, so the workers didn't have to run errands. Subsequently, Lu Deyong also created a "inspection signal." One was set up next to each bed, and when the workers wanted to find inspectors, they just stood the signal up. It probably cost more than ten yuan to make the signal stand, but when the workers heard that there was such a convenient thing, they automatically volunteered to do it. Only the first item of the improvement plan—delivering the drawings to the construction site—encountered a bit of resistance. The distributors felt that they had too much work and could not handle it. So, another measurement was made of the distributors' work, and the results proved that they had ample time to take on this work. This improvement also went smoothly.
    In this way, the workshop strengthened on-site service, greatly increasing the utilization rate of working hours. A full month after the first measurement, Lu Yunbao conducted another measurement, still targeting the previous seven people. This time, a total of 480 minutes was measured. Wang Mingyou worked for 462 minutes; Han Hangda worked for 442 minutes; Leng Baojiu worked for 448 minutes... The seven people worked an average of 443 minutes. Seventy percent of the working hours that were wasted in the past are now being used for production.
    At the same time, the workshop also adopted some effective measures in promoting advanced experience, which greatly increased the labor productivity of the workers. In August, the entire workshop did the equivalent of more than 7,000 working hours more than in May. Before the increase in production, the workshop often worked overtime and crash work, especially towards the end of the month; this time, the task was increased by one-third, but the phenomenon of overtime and crash work was greatly reduced.
    The plant's leadership and staff believe that the Second Mechanical Workshop's approach is a pragmatic and effective method of improving management, and therefore promoted the workshop's experience throughout the plant. As a result, the plant's labor productivity in the third quarter increased by 17.1 percent compared to the second quarter, overfulfilling the state plan.

　　不浪费一分钟
　　周作新
    六月间，增产节约指标一下来，大连机床厂第二机械车间的领导工作人员们就吓了一跳：生产任务一下子由每月加工四十台份一Д六二车床的零件跳到六十台份。于是都吵嚷：“这算没办法了！”
    过去加工四十台份的零件，就不是很容易的，要经常加班加点，每逢月末还要突击，这下又增加三分之一的任务，那还抗得了吗！
    工厂领导工作人员的决心丝毫没有动摇。工厂党的组织要求车间的党员们，竭尽一切力量保证完成这个任务。
    车间党的支部委员会一连开了几次会，首先批判那些叫苦的人，因为他们只看到需要加班加点和突击，问起车间里还有没有潜在力量，便不清楚了。
    车间主任邹永济的思想斗争很激烈，因为，能不能完成增产任务，他要负主要责任。可是他想：工人的技术水平和车间的管理工作，能一下子提高吗？他叫过困难，也挨过批评，虽然他现在已经不再埋怨领导上“要求过高”了，但是觉得自己心中无数，不知怎样才好。他最后下决心要摸一摸底，先叫工效员鲁云宝标定一下有效工时。
    鲁云宝站在齿轮组和轴组中间，同时标定了七个人。这七个人虽然不是有意选择的，但是一般都是比较积极的。鲁云宝的标定表格很细致，每分钟记录一次每人的工作。八点十分整，鲁云宝在表格上给车工王明佑画上第一个符号；八点五十八分，这个车工去找检查员研究活的质量；九点正，他又开始工作；九点十六分，王明佑给下一批要干的活做准备，借图纸、磨刀具，一直到九点三十分，才正式把机器转动起来；机器只转动了八分钟，王明佑又去找检查员打检印；六分钟后，他又开始工作，一直到午间休息。
    鲁云宝给王明佑标定了三百五十分钟的工作情况，这个车工实际开动机器的时间，只有二百九十七分钟。其余那五十三分钟就消耗在借图、磨刀、打检印上了。一个工人在不足六个小时的工作时间里，就有近一个小时被浪费了。鲁云宝所标定的其余六个人，比王明佑的情况更差，文正忠在三百五十分钟内，只工作了二百四十五分钟；薛维发工作了二百六十六分钟；冷宝久工作了二百八十二分钟……
    鲁云宝把这个数字交给邹永济，这位车间主任大为吃惊。他过去也知道在工时方面有浪费，但是没想到会浪费得这么多！他计算了一下：用这个数字来推断全车间，那末每个月就有三千三百个工时被糟蹋了！在这些时间内，可以加工多少零件啊！他认识到过去叫困难叫得毫无理由，也感到过去心里无数简直是失职的行为。这个数字给他增加了信心和力量，他和车间副主任梁运功针对工时浪费的主要原因：借图纸、磨刀、打检印，拟出一个改进方案，并且提交车间党支部委员会讨论。改进方案很简单：图纸，不要工人接受任务后再去借，要在下任务单的时候一道送下去；磨刀，不要再由工人往磨刀室送，由磨刀工人去取，磨完再给送回；打检印也不要工人去找检查员，在干成批的小活的时候，用一个标准检印，干大活或零活，检查员就主动到机床旁边去检查。
    改进方案经过讨论后，从七月十五日起实行。
    邹永济和梁运功首先找来了磨刀工人阎廷介，打算打通他的思想，因为磨刀工人过去一向是在磨刀房一坐，谁送刀来就给谁磨，这回要让他到工人那儿去取，磨完了还得给送去，就难免会想不通。可是阎廷介没这么想，他听了两个主任的意见，很痛快地说：“这个办法好，过去没人来磨刀，我就在那儿一坐；人多挤在一块，我也是挨着排来，有浪费！这回由我来取送就能捣开空！”不两天，阎廷介创造了个循环磨刀法，在全车间各个小组之间循环取送，谁都有刀用，谁都不耽误工作。邹永济和梁运功又把检查组长鲁德永找来商谈改进检查工作，鲁德永同样赞同，他说：“我们保证做到检查及时！”工人干重要活的时候，过去总是隔几分钟就找一次检查员，现在检查人员常常就站在车床旁边，用不着工人跑腿了。随后，鲁德永还创造了个
  “检查信号”，每台床子旁边设一个，工人要找检查人员，把信号一立就行了。做信号架子，大概得十多元钱，但是工人们一听有这样方便事，就自动献工干出来了。只有在实行改进方案的第一项——把图纸送到工地——遇到一点阻碍，分配员认为自己工作太多，干不了。于是又专门给分配员的工作做了一次标定，结果证明他们完全有时间担当这项工作。这一项改进也行通了。
    就这样，这个车间加强了工地服务，使工时的利用率大大提高。鲁云宝在第一次标定之后整一个月，又进行了一次标定，对象仍然是以前那七个人，这回共标定了四百八十分钟，王明佑工作了四百六十二分钟；韩行大工作了四百四十二分钟；冷宝久工作了四百四十八分钟……七个人平均工作了四百四十三分钟。过去被浪费的工时，现在有百分之七十又用在生产上。
    和这同时，车间在推广先进经验方面又采取了一些有效措施，使工人的劳动生产率大为提高，八月份全车间比五月份多干了相当于七千多工时的活。在增产以前，这个车间经常加班加点，每逢月末都要突击；这回任务增加了三分之一，加班加点和突击现象反而大大减少了。
    工厂的领导工作人员认为：第二机械车间这种做法是一种实事求是的、有效的改进管理的方法，因之在全厂推行了这个车间的经验。结果第三季度全厂的劳动生产率比第二季度增长百分之十七点一，超额完成了国家计划。（原载辽宁日报，本报略有删改）
