    Hydropower Station in Yellow River Irrigation Area Officially Under Construction
    Construction of the Yellow River Irrigation Area Hydropower Station officially began on the 1st.

    This hydropower station is being built on the third drop of the Yellow River Irrigation Jiewei Main Canal near Xiaoji Town, Xinxiang County, Henan Province. After its completion, it will further enhance the significant role of the Yellow River Irrigation Jiewei Project. The electricity generated by the power station in the future can be used to pump water to irrigate high farmland, expanding the irrigation area of the Yellow River Irrigation Area by 54,000 mu, and can also be used to develop the agricultural product processing industry in the Yellow River Irrigation Area and supply rural lighting.
