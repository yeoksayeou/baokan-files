The two official publications of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, "Worker" bi-monthly and "Learn Culture," will be merged, renamed, and published as "China Worker."

The All-China Federation of Trade Unions stipulates that "China Worker" is a comprehensive popular magazine for ideological, political, and cultural education aimed at the broad masses of workers. To achieve this mission, "China Worker" will use various forms to propagate communism and the Communist Party to the workers, promote current events both domestically and internationally, as well as the policies of the Party and the state, promote the international workers' movement, and report on the struggles, lives, and friendships of people from all over the world, in order to enhance the patriotism, internationalism, and communist consciousness of the working masses. Secondly, it will report on the new achievements and atmosphere of national construction, introduce the deeds of millions of laborers in building a new life, encourage workers to participate in labor competitions with enthusiasm and initiative, and reflect and report on the cultural, material, political, and trade union life of the workers. Thirdly, it will launch mass criticism and self-criticism against various non-working-class ideologies and work styles, conducting mass self-education through ideological chats, discussion meetings, general discussions, vignettes, cartoons, and other forms. In addition, it will introduce scientific common sense, social knowledge, and trade union life knowledge, answer workers' questions, and help workers lead a cultured and healthy life.

"China Worker" will strive to be lively, easy to understand, rich in illustrations, and avoid rigid, old-fashioned, empty, and lifeless preaching, so that the broad masses of workers can understand and love it.

　　“工人”半月刊和“学文化”将合并改名为“中国工人”
    中华全国总工会的两份机关刊物——“工人”半月刊和“学文化”将合刊改名“中国工人”出版。
    中华全国总工会规定“中国工人”是向广大工人群众进行思想教育的政治、文化综合性的通俗杂志。为了实现这个任务，“中国工人”将通过多种多样的形式，向工人宣传共产主义和共产党，宣传国内外时事和党和国家的政策，宣传国际工人运动，报道世界各国人民的斗争、生活和友谊，以提高工人群众的爱国主义、国际主义和共产主义觉悟。其次是报道国家建设的新成就、新气象，介绍千百万劳动者在建设新生活中的事迹，鼓舞工人参加劳动竞赛的积极性和主动性，反映和报道工人的文化生活、物质生活、政治生活和工会生活。再次是针对各种非工人阶级思想作风开展群众性的批评和自我批评，通过思想漫谈、讨论会、大家谈、小品、漫画等形式进行群众性的自我教育。此外，还要介绍科学常识、社会知识、工会生活知识，解答工人的问题，帮助工人过有文化的健康的生活。
    “中国工人”将力求生动活泼，通俗易懂，图文并茂，避免死板、老套、空洞、缺乏生活气息的说教，使广大工人群众能够看懂它，并喜爱它。
