    Since the beginning of this year, state capitalist commerce in Tianjin has developed significantly. Up to now, among the more than 11,000 private retail businesses in 36 industries in the city, more than 7,000 businesses in 28 industries have been brought into the orbit of state capitalism. The proportion of state capitalist commerce in the total retail sales of commodities in the city has increased from 10 percent in the fourth quarter of last year to 32 percent. Now, whether in the bustling city center or in remote streets, one can see stores displaying signs for distributing and selling on behalf of state-owned companies, and stores that purchase goods from state-owned companies at state-owned company prices. The prices of most commodities on the market are consistent with the prices of state-owned companies.
    With the expansion of the socialist transformation of private commerce, state-owned commerce has further strengthened its wholesale business, and a socialist wholesale commercial network has been basically established. State-owned commerce has established more than 100 wholesale institutions in the city, half of which were newly established this year. In the third quarter, the proportion of socialist commerce in the city's total wholesale volume rose to more than 91 percent.
    In order to strengthen the management and supervision of state capitalist commercial entities, state-owned companies have established specialized institutions and staffed them with full-time personnel. Starting from the third quarter, the city's department store, cultural goods, coal industry building materials, and other companies have established district stores in various districts. These stores regularly understand the business situation of the distribution and sales stores through symposiums and a system of assigning field personnel to be responsible for each household, inspect their business style, and assist in solving difficult problems in business. With the assistance of state-owned companies, merchants in the pharmaceutical, chemical pigment, and other industries have also established a system of regular study for capitalists.

    天津七千多户私商纳入国家资本主义轨道
    今年以来，天津市国家资本主义商业有了显著发展。到目前为止，在全市三十六个私营零售行业一万一千多家商户中，已经有二十八个行业七千多家商户纳入了国家资本主义轨道。国家资本主义商业在全市社会商品零售总额中所占的比重，已由去年第四季度的百分之十，上升到百分之三十二。现在无论在繁华的市中心或偏僻的街道上，都可以看到挂着为国营公司经销、代销牌子的商店和从国营公司批购货品按照国营公司牌价出售的商店。市场上绝大部分商品的价格是和国营公司的价格一致的。
    随着对私营商业进行社会主义改造工作的扩展，国营商业进一步加强了批发业务，社会主义批发商业网已经基本上建立起来。国营商业在全市设置的批发机构已经有一百多处，其中有一半是今年新成立的。在第三季度，社会主义商业在全市批发总额中的比重已上升到百分之九十一以上。
    为了加强对国家资本主义性质商业的管理和监督，各国营公司都建立了专门机构，配备了专职人员。从第三季度起，市百货、文化用品、煤业建筑器材等公司在各区分别设立了区商店。这些商店通过召开座谈会的办法和外勤人员分户负责的制度，经常了解经销、代销店的经营情况，检查他们的经营作风，协助解决经营中的困难问题。在国营公司协助下，医药、化工颜料等行业商户，还建立了资方定期学习制度。
