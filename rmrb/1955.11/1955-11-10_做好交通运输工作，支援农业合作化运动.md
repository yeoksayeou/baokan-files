    Do a Good Job in Transportation to Support the Agricultural Cooperative Movement
    Wang Shoudao, Director of the Sixth Office of the State Council
    In his report on the issue of agricultural cooperation at the meeting of secretaries of provincial, municipal, and district party committees, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: A new upsurge of socialist mass movement is about to arrive in the rural areas of the country. This is a socialist revolutionary movement with a broad mass scale and great world significance. Faced with the rising tide of our country's socialist industrialization and agricultural cooperative movement, how the transportation sector can better adapt to and promote the development of industrialization, especially agricultural cooperation, and how to provide a large, high-quality, low-cost, and fast transportation capacity for industrialization and agricultural cooperation, especially providing convenient transportation conditions for agricultural cooperation, has become the most urgent political and economic task of the transportation sector.
    In the past few years, especially since the implementation of the Five-Year Plan, the transportation sector has done a lot of work, basically adapting to the needs of industrial and agricultural production development, but there are still many shortcomings and problems that need to be solved urgently. Especially from the perspective of promoting national industrialization, the development of agricultural cooperation, and expanding the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, our work has not kept up closely. If we do not work hard to improve, it will hinder the development of the national economy. Many facts have already shown that in some areas with inconvenient transportation, especially border areas, mountainous areas, and new reclamation areas, "traffic congestion" has caused some difficulties for agricultural production and the development of agricultural cooperation.
    In the past, due to our insufficient understanding of the rising new situation of the national economy, especially the scale and speed of agricultural cooperation development, and the lack of foresight, and the lack of serious research and due preparation for the law that transportation volume will inevitably increase accordingly, the various tasks of the transportation sector cannot fully meet the needs of objective development. This backward situation is mainly manifested in: on the one hand, there is a lack of comprehensive planning and strong leadership for the transportation construction and transportation work that are indispensable for adapting to and promoting agricultural cooperation, so that the existing county and township roads, bridges, ferries, and small and medium-sized waterways are in disrepair, and transportation in border and mountainous areas has not been well developed. In the minds of many transportation cadres, more attention is paid to providing transportation conditions for industrial bases and industrial production, which is of course correct and necessary, but the idea of neglecting local transportation work and not paying attention to the transportation work in the vast rural areas is quite common and serious. On the other hand, in some areas, there is a lack of comprehensive planning in terms of production, business, and socialist transformation for the transportation industry of various non-socialist economic components, so that the enthusiasm of various non-socialist economic components of the transportation industry cannot be better utilized and better incorporated into the national economic plan. Some cadres still have serious passive attitudes towards the transformation and arrangement of the individual transportation industry, holding a laissez-faire attitude of "dragging down" and "squeezing out". In the future, in order to adapt to and promote industrialization, especially agricultural cooperation, and according to the growing transportation needs and the level of industrial development in our country, the transportation sector should immediately start to formulate a practical overall plan for developing the transportation industry and a phased annual implementation plan, and make comprehensive arrangements for various transportation tools belonging to various economic components. Local transportation departments must, under the leadership of party committees at all levels, comprehensively consider and formulate regional overall plans for developing transportation and comprehensive plans for arranging and transforming various non-socialist economic components of the transportation industry, and integrate the two.
    In local transportation work, in addition to building and整治 necessary trunk lines and tributaries, as well as branch lines and tributaries connecting land and water trunk lines, we must face the rural areas, border areas, mountainous areas, and new reclamation areas. Based on regional national economic development plans, especially according to the needs of agricultural production and the broad masses, we must implement the principles of relying on the people, using local materials, and adapting to local conditions to build simple standard roads suitable for local transportation tools, as well as bridges, ferries, and整治 small and medium-sized rivers that have a transportation function. We must resolutely overcome the deviation of being divorced from local transportation needs and disregarding the needs of the masses. This deviation is prominently manifested in emphasizing the construction of highways and bridges with excessively high standards, neglecting the principles of "applicable," "economical," and appropriately taking care of future development, and spending a large sum of money on a bridge and a section of road, but the current transportation requirements still cannot be met. We must strengthen the management and maintenance of existing highways and waterways, and gradually improve the quality of highways and improve waterway navigation conditions. Each province must quickly revise the maintenance and renovation plans for highways and waterways for the next two years, and prepare to formulate the second five-year plan. Shandong Province adopted the method of combining road crews with the masses to improve more than 300 kilometers of dirt roads in 1954, and will continue to improve 700 kilometers of dirt roads this year, and has also formulated a maintenance and renovation plan for the next two years. Ji County, Hebei Province, used the slack season to organize migrant workers to build hard work and renovated 262 kilometers of highways. Sichuan, Hunan, Shanxi and other provinces, as well as Huanren County in Liaoning Province, have also made some achievements in整治 local rivers, building mountain roads, and relying on the people to improve old roads. This is worth learning and promoting in various places. Highway transportation and local inland waterway transportation are the main modes of local transportation. All localities should vigorously strengthen leadership over automobile transportation and water transportation enterprises, gradually improve the level of enterprise management, ensure transportation safety, strive to reduce costs, appropriately reduce freight rates, and open up operating routes as much as possible, facing the vast rural areas, and not limited to a few cities and the existing few routes. In some areas, the capitalist business thinking of not considering freight rates from the perspective of developing production and expanding the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, and only wanting to make more money by relying on high freight rates, should be criticized and corrected.
    In order to promote the development of agricultural cooperation, the transportation sector must strengthen transportation organization, rationally utilize existing transportation tools, give play to its positive role, ensure the timely arrival of agricultural tools, seeds, fertilizers, pesticides and pesticide equipment, and rural daily necessities, without delaying agricultural time, and ensure the outward transportation of agricultural products and local specialties. It is also necessary to rationally reduce the transportation prices of agricultural production materials and agricultural products and local specialties to invigorate the rural economy and develop rural production. In addition, civil aviation should guarantee the professional flights required for agriculture for eliminating diseases and insect pests and aerial surveying; the postal and telecommunications departments should, under the leadership and assistance of local party and government departments, actively 整顿 and steadily develop intra-county telephones according to local financial resources and actual needs. At the same time, actively tap the potential within the enterprise, improve rural postal work, ensure the timely delivery of orders and instructions from party and government leading organs and newspapers and periodicals, and closely connect urban and rural postal and telecommunications communications.
    The socialist transformation of wooden sailboats, animal-powered vehicles and individual transportation industry must be actively carried out.
    According to incomplete statistics, there are about 290,000 wooden sailboats in the country, with a deadweight of more than 3.1 million tons, and about 2.8 million employees and their families. In 1954, the freight turnover of inland river wooden sailboats accounted for about 70% of the total local inland river transportation volume. The number of animal-powered vehicles in the country is very large, and there is no comprehensive statistics yet. Only about 320,000 vehicles have been organized and managed by the transportation department, with about 540,000 employees. This large and decentralized individual transportation industry will continue to play an important role in developing agricultural production and invigorating the primary market for a considerable period of time in the future. Then, what path should this transportation army take in the great socialist construction and socialist transformation of our country? That is to say, should we let these millions of working people take the socialist road? Or should we let them fend for themselves and let them take the capitalist road? This is not only related to the future of millions of working people, but also related to the socialist transformation of agriculture and the development of the rural economy. According to the general line of the Party, they must take the socialist road without exception. Facts have proved that the individual transportation industry can better give play to its labor enthusiasm and improve labor productivity only through the road of mutual assistance and cooperation for socialist transformation, gradually transforming from individual operation to collective operation; it can better be incorporated into the national transportation plan and overcome blindness in transportation and difficulties in operation; it can also gradually increase the income of members and accumulate public property due to the continuous improvement of labor productivity; that is to say, it is beneficial to the country and to these working people. Taking the航线 from Nanchang to Ji'an on the Gan River in Jiangxi as an example, it takes 24 days for a single ship to travel back and forth once in the dry season, but only 20 days for a cooperative ship, and the fastest only 17 days; in terms of labor productivity in the first quarter of this year, if the average labor force of a single ship is 100, then the mutual aid group is 114, and the cooperative is 137; the income of boatmen for each labor force of a single ship is 100, then the mutual aid group is 109, and the cooperative is 138; and the cooperative played an active leading role in抢运 disaster relief grain on the航线. Its superiority is extremely obvious.
    Although the socialist transformation of the individual transportation industry has long been proposed by the transportation department, there is a lack of specific leadership, and the work of investigation and research and summing up experience has not been done enough. So far, only seven animal-powered vehicle transportation cooperatives, 30 wooden sailboat transportation cooperatives and 692 wooden sailboat transportation mutual aid groups have been organized in the country. In addition, some of them are spontaneously organized and have not obtained the active leadership of relevant departments. Even the masses demand leadership, but the relevant departments do not lead. Some people think that the individual transportation industry is backward and has no future, and they are afraid of "carrying a burden" when organizing it. They even adopt the attitude of "persuading dissolution if persuasion is ineffective, and letting it be eliminated naturally" for those that have already been organized. Some are still stuck in the "pilot" stage, and some are hesitating at the crossroads of "taking the cooperative road" and "not taking the cooperative road". Some even believe that "only by挤掉 wooden sailboats and animal-powered vehicles can the state-owned transportation industry have a way out and show the superiority of the socialist economy." Individual areas want to replace socialist transformation with simple and blind "转业" methods. All of these are manifestations of the right-leaning thought of neglecting the role of the individual transportation industry and not caring about the future and needs of the masses. This kind of lingering and leading behind the masses must be strictly criticized and corrected.
    It must be affirmed that the individual transportation industry must carry out socialist transformation through the road of mutual assistance and cooperation, and a practical overall plan must be formulated. According to the progress of agricultural cooperation, 60% to 70% or more of wooden sailboats and animal-powered vehicles should be formed into transportation cooperatives by 1957. Is this possible? We think it is possible. Because: there is an extremely favorable situation of the high tide of socialist industrialization and agricultural cooperation, there is the active demand of the broad masses of the individual transportation industry, most of the wooden sailboats and animal-powered vehicles have already implemented the basis of编组编队 and unified配儎, unified scheduling, and unified freight rates, there are more than 600 transportation mutual aid groups and dozens of transportation cooperatives that have been organized as examples, especially with the support and assistance of state-owned transportation enterprises, as long as we "comprehensively plan and strengthen leadership", we can complete the above tasks.
    In carrying out the mutual assistance and cooperation movement of the individual transportation industry, it is necessary to correctly divide the class components and determine specific policies. According to the initial understanding of wooden sailboats, they can generally be divided into: boatmen (hired laborers), laboring boat people (self-boat, self-driving), and boat owners (those who rely on exploitation income for a living or who participate in labor but mainly rely on exploitation for a living). Boatmen and laboring boat people account for the vast majority of boat people, and boat owners only account for about 2%. Due to economic status, the poor boat people among the boatmen and laboring boat people show positive enthusiasm in their attitude towards mutual assistance and cooperation. Therefore, we should take the poor boat people among the boatmen and laboring boat people as the basic force, and rely on them to actively unite the rich boat people among the laboring boat people to ensure the smooth progress of the mutual assistance and cooperation movement. The situation of animal-powered vehicles is roughly similar to that of wooden sailboats. Correctly dividing the class components in the individual transportation industry is a very complex and meticulous task. So far, there is no mature experience in this regard. It is hoped that transportation departments in various places will take a cautious attitude in actual work and conduct in-depth typical investigations and research work.
    Transportation cooperatives are generally developed from mutual aid groups to semi-socialist cooperatives on the basis of编组编队 and the three unifications (unified配儎, unified scheduling, and unified freight rates). In the process of organization, preparation work must be done well, mainly ideological brewing and selecting key personnel for running the社, and the principle of voluntary mutual benefit must be implemented. The organization of cooperatives should consider: (1) Adhere to the principle of voluntary membership in the 社, and never force orders; (2) Vehicles and boats should be reasonably priced according to actual prices and converted into shares, and production equipment should also be converted into shares at a discount; (3) The distribution of income from vehicle, boat shares and labor should be appropriate. Under the same operating income, the income of workers (excluding public accumulation funds and public welfare funds) should not be lower than their original wage level; (4) Labor income should resolutely adopt the principle of distribution according to work. The labor force level should be evaluated according to the strength, skill level, etc. of the labor force, and men and women should be paid equally for equal work; (5) In addition to deducting depreciation and repair costs for vehicles and boats, the cooperative should appropriately set aside public accumulation funds and public welfare funds, and determine a certain proportion according to the specific operating income in various places;
  (6) 社 members can freely withdraw from the 社 and should reasonably return their vehicles, boats, tools, shares, etc., but they must not take away public accumulation funds and public welfare funds; after being organized, it is necessary to fully develop democracy within the 社, strengthen production organization and management, strive to increase production and increase the income of 社 members on the basis of increasing production. At the same time, how to reasonably raise livestock after they join the 社 is a problem that the animal-powered vehicle transportation cooperative must properly solve. All of the above need to be further created and summed up experience in the movement, and the articles of association of the transportation cooperative should be formulated. In addition, it should also be noted that when organizing cooperatives for wooden sailboats sailing on major waterways, the shipping route, ship tonnage, ship type, draft depth and other factors should be taken into account as much as possible according to transportation needs, and transportation cooperatives should be organized separately. For wooden sailboats that have been organized and are suitable for barges, state-owned transportation enterprises should use them as wooden barges for tugboats as much as possible in production to increase the country's transportation capacity.
    Wooden sailboat and animal-powered vehicle transportation cooperatives should be strictly limited to the scope of vehicles and boats engaged in professional transportation. Vehicles and boats in rural areas that engage in agriculture and transportation at the same time should be directly arranged along with agricultural cooperation. Professional transportation of wooden sailboats and animal-powered vehicles can also be partially transferred to agricultural production cooperatives as needed and possible. Wooden sailboats engaged in professional transportation along the coast and lakes can also be partially transferred to fishery production cooperatives. In addition to organizing transportation cooperatives according to the current transportation needs in major and medium-sized cities, surplus vehicles can be mobilized to transfer to agricultural production cooperatives or new reclamation areas. A small number of large wooden sailboats of a capitalist nature can participate in joint state-private shipping companies as barges. In individual航线 where there are few capitalist wooden sailboats and transformation cannot be organized into joint ventures due to other restrictions, they can be absorbed into the local transportation cooperative separately under the condition that the organization is relatively consolidated, the owner voluntarily gives up exploitation, and the masses agree to accept it, but they must not participate in leadership.
    The socialist transformation of the individual transportation industry must be carried out under the overall planning and unified leadership of party committees at all levels. Local transportation departments should work hard to do a good job in various specific organizational and leadership tasks under the leadership of local party committees; the Ministry of Transportation should strengthen guidance in terms of relevant policies and production operations and pay attention to summing up and exchanging experiences.
    I studied Chairman Mao's report on the issue of agricultural cooperation, and listened to the speeches of many central and local responsible comrades at the Sixth Plenary Session (Expanded) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party. My thinking was greatly inspired, and many concerns and unclear issues were resolved. I deeply realized the importance of learning Comrade Mao Zedong's thought methods and leadership methods. Recently, Chairman Mao instructed all departments to promptly check their work, promptly discover problems, solve problems, and correct shortcomings. Don't wait until you have made a big mistake before making a historical review. This time, Chairman Mao promptly grasped the leadership of the issue of agricultural cooperation, promptly investigated and studied, grasped the materials, and promptly convened a conference to launch a discussion, so that the problems were systematically solved ideologically and practically, which provided the best example for our entire party. Every comrade, whether an old cadre or a new cadre, should sincerely learn Chairman Mao's working methods, so that our work will be done better, and we will avoid many mistakes or make fewer mistakes. Cadres in the transportation sector must conscientiously study Chairman Mao's report and the main documents of the Sixth Plenary Session (Expanded) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party, and check their work in accordance with the spirit of the documents, strictly criticize right-leaning thoughts in the face of the socialist revolution, and criticize the purely professional viewpoint of being divorced from politics and not combining with the Party's general line to arrange their work. Senior cadres should further study how to conduct comprehensive planning for their work, conscientiously improve their work, warmly welcome the arrival of the high tide of the national agricultural cooperation movement, and actively support the agricultural cooperation movement.

    做好交通运输工作，支援农业合作化运动
    国务院第六办公室主任　王首道
    毛泽东同志在省、市委和区党委书记会议上关于农业合作化问题的报告中指出：在全国农村中，新的社会主义群众运动的高潮就要到来。这是一个具有广泛的群众规模、具有伟大的世界意义的社会主义革命运动。处在我国社会主义工业化和农业合作化运动日益高涨的形势面前，交通运输部门如何更好地适应并促进工业化特别是农业合作化的发展，如何为工业化和农业合作化提供量大、质好、价廉、快速的运输能力，特别是为农业合作化提供便利的交通条件，已经成为交通运输部门最迫切的政治任务和经济任务。
    过去几年来，特别是在执行五年计划以来，交通运输部门做了不少的工作，基本上适应了工农业生产发展的需要，但是还有许多缺点和问题，亟待解决，特别是从促进国家工业化、农业合作化的发展以及扩大城乡物资交流这一角度出发来考虑我们的工作，还未能紧紧地跟上去，如果不努力改进，将妨碍国民经济的发展。目前许多事实已经说明：某些交通不便的地区，特别是边疆、山区和新的农垦区，“交通阻塞”已经使农业生产和农业合作化的发展遭到了一些困难。
    过去由于我们对国民经济日益高涨的新形势，特别是对农业合作化发展的规模和速度，认识不足，缺乏预见，对交通运输量必然与之相应地增长这一规律，缺乏认真的研究和应有的准备，因而交通运输部门的各项工作，还不能完全适应客观发展的需要。这种落后情况主要表现在：一方面是对于适应并促进农业合作化所必不可缺的交通建设和运输工作，缺少全面规划和强有力的领导，以致现有的县乡道路、桥梁、渡口以及中小航道失修失养，边疆和山区的交通还没有很好地开辟，在不少的交通运输干部的头脑中，比较地注意了为工业基地、工业生产提供交通运输条件，这当然是正确的必要的，但是忽视地方交通工作和不注意广大农村的交通运输工作的思想相当普遍、严重。另方面是在某些地区对于各种非社会主义经济成份的运输业，缺少在生产业务和社会主义改造方面的全面规划，以致不能更好地利用各种非社会主义经济成份的运输业的积极性，并使其更好地纳入国家经济计划。在一部分干部中仍然有严重的对个体运输业的改造和安排抱着放任自流和“拖垮”“挤垮”的消极态度。今后为了适应并促进工业化特别是农业合作化的发展，根据日益增长的运输需要和我国工业发展的水平，交通运输部门应立即动手，制定切实可行的发展交通运输业的总体规划和分期分年实施方案，并对属于各种不同经济成份的各种运输工具作出统筹兼顾、全面安排的规划。地方交通运输部门必须在各级党委领导下，通盘考虑和制定地区性的发展交通运输的全面规划和安排改造各种非社会主义经济成份运输业的全面规划，并使两者相互结合起来。
    在地方交通运输工作中，除修建和整治必要的干线干流以及连接水陆干线的支线支流外，必须面向农村、边疆、山区和新的农垦区，依据地区性的国民经济发展计划，特别是要根据农业生产和广大群众的需要，贯彻执行依靠民力，就地取材和因地制宜的原则，修建适合于当地运输工具的简易标准道路以及桥梁、渡口，整治有运输作用的中小河流等。必须坚决克服脱离当地运输需要和不顾群众需要的偏向，这种偏向突出地表现在强调修建标准过高的公路和桥梁，忽视“适用”“经济”和适当照顾将来发展的原则，把一大笔资金花在一座桥和一段路上，结果仍然不能满足当前的运输要求。必须加强对现有公路、航道的管理和养护工作，逐步提高公路质量和改善航道航行条件，各省必须迅速修订今后两年对公路航道的养护整修计划，并准备制定第二个五年计划。山东省采用道班同群众相结合的方式，一九五四年改善土路面三百多公里，今年继续改善土路面七百多公里，还制定了今后两年养护整修计划。河北省蓟县利用农隙组织民工建勤，整修了公路二六二公里。四川、湖南、山西等省以及辽宁省的桓仁县，在整治地方河道、修建山区大道及依靠民力改善旧路等方面，也有一些成绩。这是值得各地学习和推广的。公路运输以及地方内河航运是地方交通的主要方式，各地应对汽车运输、水运企业大力加强领导，逐步提高企业管理水平，确保运输安全，努力降低成本，适当降低运价，尽可能多地开辟营运线路，面向广大农村，不要局限在几个城市和现有的几条线路上，某些地区不从发展生产扩大城乡物资交流的观点出发考虑运价，只想靠高运价多赚钱的资本主义经营思想，应予批判和改正。
    为了促进农业合作化的发展，交通运输部门必须加强运输组织工作，合理利用现有各种运输工具，发挥它的积极作用，保证农具、种子、肥料、农药和农药器械及农村日用品的及时到达，不误农时，保证农产品和土特产品的外运，并须合理地降低农业生产资料和农产品、土特产品的运输价格，以活跃农村经济，发展农村生产。此外，民用航空应该保证农业所需要的灭除病虫害以及航测的专业飞行；邮电部门应在地方党政领导和帮助下，根据地方财力可能和实际需要，积极的整顿、稳步地发展县内电话，同时积极发掘企业内部的潜力，改善乡邮工作，保证党政领导机关命令、指示以及报纸刊物的及时下达，密切城乡的邮电通信联系。
    对木帆船、兽力车个体运输业必须积极进行社会主义改造。
    据不完全的统计，全国有木帆船约二十九万多艘，载重三百一十多万吨，从业人员及其家属约二百八十多万人，一九五四年内河木帆船货运周转量占地方内河总运量的百分之七十左右。全国兽力车为数很大，现在还没有全面统计，只是已经由运输部门组织管理的约三十二万辆，从业人员约五十四万人。这些大量的、分散的个体运输业，在今后一个相当长的时期内，对发展农业生产和活跃初级市场将继续发挥它的重要作用。那末，这支运输大军，在我国伟大的社会主义建设和社会主义改造过程中，应该走什么道路呢？也就是说，让这几百万劳动人民走社会主义的道路呢？还是让他们自生自灭、任其走资本主义道路呢？这不仅关联到几百万劳动人民的前途问题，而且是关联到农业社会主义改造和农村经济发展的问题。根据党的总路线，他们必须是不例外地走社会主义的道路。事实证明：个体运输业只有通过互助合作的道路进行社会主义改造，由个体经营逐步转变为集体经营，才能更好地发挥劳动积极性，提高劳动生产率；才能更好地纳入国家运输计划，克服运输上的盲目性和营运中的困难；也才能由于劳动生产率的不断提高，逐步增加社员的收入，并可积累公共财产；这就是说，对国家、对这些劳动人民都有好处。以江西赣江南昌至吉安的航线为例，枯水季节往返一个航次，单干船要走二十四天，合作船只走二十天，最快的只走十七天；以今年第一季度的劳动生产率来说，单干船平均每个劳动力为一○○，则互助组为一一四，合作社为一三七；船民收入单干船每劳动力为一○○，则互助组为一○九，合作社为一三八；并在该线抢运救灾粮时，合作社起了积极带头作用。其优越性是极为明显的。
    关于个体运输业的社会主义改造问题，交通部门虽早已提出，但是缺乏具体领导，调查研究总结经验的工作做得不够，到目前为止，全国已经组织起来的，仅有七个兽力车运输合作社、三十个木帆船运输合作社和六百九十二个木帆船运输互助组，此外并有一部分是自发组织起来的，尚未取得有关部门的积极领导，甚至群众要求领导而有关部门不去领导。有的人认为个体运输业落后，没有前途，组织起来怕“背包袱”，甚至对于已经组织起来的“拟采取说服解散，说服无效则任其自然淘汰”的态度。有的老停留在“试办”阶段，有的徘徊于“走合作化”和“不走合作化”的十字路口上。甚至有的认为“只有把木帆船、兽力车挤掉，才能使国营运输业有出路，才能显示社会主义经济的优越性”。个别地区想以简单的盲目的“转业”办法来代替社会主义改造。凡此种种，都是一种忽视个体运输业的作用，不关心群众的前途和需要的右倾思想表现，这种裹足不前，领导落后于群众的状况，必须加以严格批判和纠正。
    对个体运输业必须肯定要通过互助合作的道路进行社会主义改造，并须制定切实可行的全面规划。根据农业合作化的进度，木帆船、兽力车到一九五七年应有百分之六、七十或更多一些组成运输合作社。这是否可能呢？我们认为是可能的。因为：有社会主义工业化和农业合作化高潮的极为有利的形势，有个体运输业广大劳动群众的积极要求，有大部分木帆船、兽力车已经实行了编组编队和统一配儎、统一调度、统一运价的基础，有已经组织起来的六百多个运输互助组和几十个运输合作社作榜样，特别是有国营运输企业的支持和帮助，只要我们“全面规划、加强领导”是可以完成上述任务的。
    在进行个体运输业的互助合作运动中，必须正确地划分阶级成份确定具体政策。根据对木帆船的初步了解，一般可分为：船工（雇佣劳动者）、劳动船民（自船、自驶的）和船主（依靠剥削收入为生或虽参加劳动而主要依靠剥削为生者），船工和劳动船民占船民的绝大多数，船主仅占百分之二左右。由于经济地位的关系，在对待互助合作的态度上，船工和劳动船民中间的贫苦船民表现积极热情。因此，我们应该以船工和劳动船民中间的贫苦船民为基本力量，并依靠他们积极地去团结劳动船民中间的富裕船民，以保证互助合作运动的顺利进行。兽力车的情况大体也同木帆船相类似。在个体运输业中正确地划分阶级成份，是一件十分复杂而细致的工作，到目前为止，在这方面还没有成熟的经验，希望各地交通运输部门在实际工作中，采取慎重的态度，进行深入的典型调查和研究工作。
    运输合作社，一般的是在编组编队和三统（统一配儎、统一调度、统一运价）的基础上，广泛发展互助组再发展到半社会主义性质的合作社。在组织过程中，必须做好准备工作，主要是思想酝酿和挑选办社骨干，必须贯彻执行自愿互利原则。组织合作社应考虑：（一）坚持自愿入社的原则，绝不能强迫命令；（二）车、船应按实际价格合理计价入股，生产属具也以折价入股为好；（三）车、船股份和劳动力的收益分配应适当，在同样营运收入情况下工人所得（除应摊的公积金和公益金外）应不低于其原来工资水平；（四）劳动力收入应坚决采取按劳取酬的原则，根据劳动力的强弱技术高低等评定劳动力的等级，男女同工同酬；（五）合作社除提出车、船折旧修理费外，应适当提出公积金和公益金，根据各地具体营运收入情况确定一定比例；
  （六）社员可以自由退社并应合理退还其车、船、工具、股金等，但不得带走公积金和公益金；在组织起来后，必须充分发扬社内民主，加强生产组织管理，努力增产并在增产的基础上增加社员收入，同时牲畜入社后，如何合理饲养，是兽力车运输合作社必须妥善加以解决的问题。以上这些，都有待在运动中进一步去创造和总结经验，并制定运输合作社的章程。另外，还应注意，在主要航道航行的木帆船组织合作社时，应根据运输需要，尽可能照顾到航线，船舶吨位、船型、吃水深浅等情况，分别组织运输合作社。对于已经组织起来的适合作驳子的木帆船，国营运输企业在生产上应尽可能利用其作拖轮的木驳，以增加国家的运输力。
    木帆船、兽力车运输合作社，应严格限制在专业运输的车、船范围内。农村中经营农业同时又经营运输业的车、船，应该直接随着农业合作化加以安排。专业运输的木帆船、兽力车，也可根据需要和可能，部分转入农业生产合作社，沿海和湖泊专业运输的木帆船也可部分的转入渔业生产合作社。大、中城市的兽力车，除应根据目前市内运输需要，组织运输合作社外，多余的车辆可动员转入农业生产合作社或新的农垦区。对少数资本主义性质的大木帆船，则可参加轮船业公私合营公司作驳船使用，其中个别航线因资本主义性质的木帆船数量较少，又因其它条件限制，无法组织合营公司进行改造者，则可在当地运输合作社组织较为巩固，业主本人自愿放弃剥削，又为群众同意接受的情况下，分别吸收其入社，但不得参与领导。
    对个体运输业的社会主义改造工作，必须在地方各级党委全面规划统一领导下来进行，地方交通部门应在当地党委领导下努力做好各项具体组织领导工作；交通部应在有关方针政策和生产业务方面，加强指导并注意总结和交流经验。
    我学习了毛主席关于农业合作化问题的报告，在党的七届六中全会（扩大）上又听了许多中央及各地负责同志的发言，思想上受到很大启示，解决了许多顾虑和模糊不清的问题，深刻地体会到学习毛泽东同志的思想方法和领导方法的重要性。最近毛主席指示各部门，要及时地检查工作，及时地发现问题、解决问题和纠正缺点，不要等到积成大错之后，再来作历史检讨。这次毛主席对农业合作化问题及时抓紧领导，及时调查研究，掌握材料，及时召集大会展开讨论，因而在思想上、在实际工作上，有系统地解决了问题，这就给我们全党提供了最好的榜样。我们每个同志，不论老干部或新干部，都应该诚诚恳恳地学习毛主席的工作方法，这样就会使我们的工作做得好些，就会使我们避免许多错误或少犯错误。交通运输部门的干部，必须认真学习毛主席的报告和七届六中全会（扩大）的各项主要文件，并按照文件精神检查自己的工作，严格批判在社会主义革命面前的右倾思想，批判脱离政治不结合党的总路线去安排自己工作的单纯业务观点，高级干部更应进一步研究如何对自己的工作进行全面规划，认真改进自己的工作，热情地迎接全国农业合作化运动高潮的到来，积极地支援农业合作化运动。
