The "Exhibition of Evidence of US-Dropped Spies" in Chongqing, which began on September 25th and ended on October 27th, was visited by a total of over 740,000 people. These included people from all walks of life in Chongqing, representatives from 119 counties in 12 special districts under Sichuan Province, and a Yunnan ethnic minority visiting delegation composed of 15 ethnic groups from the border areas. The Soviet cultural delegation visiting Chongqing, Mrs. Blum, Permanent Member and Secretary of the Secretariat of the World Peace Council from Belgium, the All-German Youth Delegation, and the British Friends Service Council delegation also visited the exhibition. When Mrs. Blum saw the audience write "Sharpen your eyes and eliminate all counter-revolutionaries" in the guestbook, she then wrote in the guestbook: "Not only Chinese people should sharpen their eyes, but also Europeans should sharpen their eyes."

This exhibition has enhanced the vigilance of the broad masses of the people and promoted the struggle to eliminate all counter-revolutionaries. After visiting the exhibition, factories, government agencies, and schools held more than 1,500 discussion meetings. Many people reported hidden counter-revolutionaries to public security organs after the visit; some counter-revolutionaries also voluntarily handed over radio communication equipment and other items that had been hidden for a long time.

    在重庆展出的美国空投特务罪证展览会闭幕
    在重庆市展出的“美国空投特务罪证展览会”，自九月二十五日开始至十月二十七日结束，前往参观的共有七十四万多人。其中除重庆市各界人民外，还有四川省所属十二个专区一百一十九个县的机关工作人员组成的代表参观小组，以及来自边疆由十五个民族组成的云南民族参观团。前来重庆访问的苏联文化代表团，世界和平理事会常务委员兼书记处书记比利时布伦姆夫人、全德青年代表团及英国公谊会代表团等也到展览会参观。布伦姆夫人看见观众在意见簿上写的“要擦亮眼睛，肃清一切反革命分子”时，她便接着在意见薄上写道：“不仅中国人要擦亮眼睛，而且欧洲人也要擦亮眼睛。”
    这次展览，提高了广大人民群众的警惕性，推动了肃清一切反革命分子的斗争。参观展览会后，工厂、机关、学校曾先后举行了一千五百多次座谈会。不少群众在参观后向公安机关检举了暗藏的反革命分子；有些反革命分子也自动交出了隐藏很久的无线电讯器材等物。
