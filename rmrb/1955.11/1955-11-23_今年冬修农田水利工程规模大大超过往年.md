　　This Year's Winter Farmland Water Conservancy Project Scale Greatly Exceeds Previous Years
　　This year's winter farmland water conservancy projects have successively commenced in many regions across the country, with a scale greatly exceeding previous years.
　　Due to the long freezing period in the winter, provinces in the Northeast region began water conservancy construction ahead of schedule in September and October. In Heilongjiang Province, some counties had already completed 50-60% of their 1956 tasks by late September. Sichuan Province commenced work comprehensively at the beginning of October, and the project is progressing rapidly; the 2,900 mountain ponds originally planned to be completed by the spring plowing of 1956 in the Nanchong area have recently been completed ahead of schedule. In addition to developing new wells and repairing old wells in conjunction with wheat planting, Henan Province is also preparing to build many small reservoirs in mountainous areas. The first batch of over 100,000 workers participating in the Dongting Lake levee repair project in Hunan Province are draining water, clearing sludge, and breaking ground. Some farmland water conservancy projects have also commenced in Shandong, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hubei, Guizhou, Guangdong and other provinces.
　　The vigorously developing agricultural collectivization movement across the country has greatly promoted the development of farmland water conservancy work. After the Ministry of Water Resources held zonal farmland water conservancy work conferences in Changsha, Chengdu, Shenyang, Beijing, Lanzhou, and other places from June to September, it initially planned to expand the irrigated area by 31 million mu nationwide in 1956, an increase of nearly double that of 1955. Subsequently, various localities have combined agricultural collectivization and the comprehensive planning of agricultural production to conduct comprehensive planning of farmland water conservancy. The original plan of Jilin Province was to expand paddy fields and irrigated land by 675,000 mu, but it has recently been revised to 900,000 mu. Among the more than 1,800 farmland water conservancy projects planned to be constructed in Guangdong Province, there are more than 200 larger ones, most of which are distributed in key agricultural collectivization counties and major grain-producing areas. One hundred and twenty townships in Henan Province have already made comprehensive plans for farmland water conservancy.
　　In order to ensure the completion of the task of constructing farmland water conservancy, in addition to planning and designing various projects, issuing water conservancy loans, and preparing various materials, various localities are also vigorously training farmer water conservancy technicians. Heilongjiang, Jilin, Hebei, Shanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Henan, Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian, Guangxi, Guizhou and other provinces and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region plan to train a total of 200,000 farmer water conservancy technicians. Some places have already completed the training, and some places are stepping up the training. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

　　在社会主义的道路上前进
　　今年冬修农田水利工程规模大大超过往年
　　今年冬修农田水利工程已经在全国许多地区陆续开工，规模大大超过往年。
　　东北地区各省因为冬季结冻时间较长，在九、十月间就开始提前兴修水利。黑龙江省有些县到九月下旬已经完成一九五六年任务的百分之五、六十。四川省在十月初全面开工，工程进展很快；南充专区原计划到一九五六年春耕前修成的二千九百口山弯塘，最近已经提前完工。河南省除结合种麦工作开展打新井和修旧井外，还准备在山区修筑许多小型水库。参加湖南省洞庭湖堤垸整修工程的第一批十万多个民工，正在排水清污，破土动工。山东、安徽、江苏、浙江、湖北、贵州、广东等省也有一部分农田水利工程已经开始动工。
    全国正在蓬勃发展着的农业合作化运动，大大推动了农田水利工作的开展。水利部经过六月到九月在长沙、成都、沈阳、北京、兰州等地分区召开农田水利工作会议后，初步计划一九五六年在全国扩大灌溉面积三千一百万亩，比一九五五年增加近一倍。随后，各地纷纷结合农业合作化和农业生产的全面规划，进行农田水利的全面规划。吉林省原计划扩大水田和水浇地六十七万五千亩，最近已经修改为九十万亩。广东省计划兴修的一千八百多处农田水利工程中，较大的有二百多处，大都分布在农业合作化的重点县和主要产粮区。河南省已经有一百二十个乡作出了农田水利的全面规划。
    为了保证完成兴修农田水利的任务，各地除了对各项工程进行规划设计，发放水利贷款，准备各种物资和材料等外，还大力训练农民水利技术员。黑龙江、吉林、河北、山西、甘肃、青海、河南、山东、江苏、安徽、湖北、湖南、江西、福建、广西、贵州等省和内蒙古自治区共计划训练农民水利技术员二十万名，目前有的地方已经训练完毕，有的地方正在加紧训练。（据新华社讯）
