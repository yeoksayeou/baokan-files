Congratulations on the Full Opening of the Chengdu-Aba Highway
Chairman of the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Sichuan Province, Sangji Yuexi

　　The Chengdu-Aba Highway, stretching from the rich western Sichuan Plain to the snow-capped mountains and grasslands famous in the history of the Chinese revolution, is now fully open to traffic. The 400,000 Tibetan, Qiang, Han, and Hui people living in the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Sichuan Province are greeting the opening of this highway with unparalleled joy and enthusiasm. The completion of the Chengdu-Aba Highway is another brilliant achievement of the ethnic policies of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao. It embodies the deep concern of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the Central People's Government for the minority people living far away in the snow-capped mountains and grasslands. It creates conditions for the further development and construction of the Autonomous Region, and makes the construction of the Autonomous Region and the construction of the motherland more closely linked.

　　Twenty years ago, when the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army passed through the grasslands and went north to resist Japan, they personally witnessed the suffering of the people of the Autonomous Region under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. For many years, the only means of transportation in the Autonomous Region were mules, horses, and yaks, and in many places people could only walk. This isolated the people of all ethnic groups in the Autonomous Region from the interior of the motherland, making it impossible to improve production, and livestock often died in large numbers due to epidemics. Only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the Central People's Government have the people of all ethnic groups in the Autonomous Region been politically liberated and made progress in economic construction. The gradual opening of the Chengdu-Aba Highway has already brought prosperity to the Autonomous Region. Cattle, sheep, furs, and medicinal materials produced in the Autonomous Region have begun to be transported out to contribute to the socialist construction of the motherland; large quantities of building materials, agricultural tools, grain, tea, salt, and cloth have also begun to be transported to the grasslands. New power plants, leather factories, and bone meal factories have been established in the Autonomous Region, new towns are constantly emerging, and large-scale state-owned mechanized farms and pastures have been established and are being established. All this shows that the agricultural, pastoral, and industrial construction of the Autonomous Region is developing and will develop.

　　We are deeply grateful to the soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army who built the Chengdu-Aba Highway. They inherited the glorious tradition of the Red Army of not fearing hardship and difficulty, overcame the violent winds and snows and rapid mountain streams on the plateau, and opened up a road that leads the people of all ethnic groups in the Autonomous Region to happiness. The sons and daughters of all ethnic groups in our Autonomous Region will always remember their merits.

　　The construction and opening of the Chengdu-Aba Highway makes us deeply realize that only the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao are the saviors of all ethnic groups. We know that the completion of the Chengdu-Aba Highway is only the beginning of a happy life for the people of all ethnic groups in the Autonomous Region. In the future, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the people of all ethnic groups in the Autonomous Region must strengthen and consolidate the great unity of the people of all ethnic groups in the motherland, actively strive to learn from the Han elder brothers, and jointly build our great motherland and advance towards a happy and fulfilling socialist society.

　　祝贺成阿公路全线通车
　　四川省藏族自治区人民政府主席　桑吉悦希
    从富饶的川西平原伸向中国革命史上著名的雪山草地的成（都）阿（埧）公路全线通车了。居住在四川省藏族自治区的四十万藏族、羌族、汉族和回族人民都以无比的欢欣和热情，迎接这条公路的通车。成阿公路的修成，是中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的民族政策的又一光辉成就，它体现了中国共产党、毛主席和中央人民政府对远居在雪山草地的少数民族人民的深切关怀，为自治区的进一步发展和建设创造了条件，使自治区的建设和祖国的建设更紧密地连结了起来。
    二十年前，中国工农红军通过草地北上抗日的时候，曾亲眼看到自治区人民在国民党反动统治下所遭受的痛苦。多少年来，自治区唯一的交通工具只是骡马和牦牛，许多地方还只能步行。这就使得自治区各族人民同祖国内地隔绝起来，生产无法改进，牲畜经常因疫病大批死亡。只有在中国共产党、毛主席和中央人民政府的领导下，自治区各族人民才在政治上得到了解放，在经济建设上得到了发展。成阿公路逐段通车，就已经给自治区带来了繁荣。自治区出产的牛羊、毛皮和药材等已开始运出贡献给祖国的社会主义建设；大批的建筑器材、农具、粮食、茶叶、食盐和布匹等也开始源源运到草地。新的发电厂、皮革厂、骨粉厂在自治区建立起来了，新的市镇也不断地在出现，并已建立了和正在建立规模较大的国营机耕农场和牧场。这一切都说明了自治区的农业、牧业和工业建设正在发展和将要发展起来。
    我们深深感激修筑成阿公路的中国人民解放军战士。他们继承了红军不怕艰苦、不怕困难的光荣传统，战胜了高原上的狂风大雪、高山急流，开出了一条把自治区各族人民引向幸福的道路。我们自治区各族人民的子子孙孙将永远记着他们的功绩。
    成阿公路的修建和通车，使我们深深地体会到，只有中国共产党和毛主席才是各族人民的救星。我们知道，成阿公路的修成还仅仅是自治区各族人民过幸福生活的开始。今后自治区各族人民要在共产党和毛主席的领导下，加强和巩固祖国各族人民的大团结，积极努力向汉族老大哥学习，共同建设我们伟大的祖国，向幸福美满的社会主义社会前进。（新华社）
