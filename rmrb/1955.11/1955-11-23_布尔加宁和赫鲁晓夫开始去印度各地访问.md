Accompanying them were Nityananda Kanungo, the Indian Minister of Commerce and Industry responsible for industry, N.R. Pillai, Secretary-General of the Indian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and K. Menon, the Indian Ambassador to the Soviet Union. When they left Delhi, Indian Prime Minister Nehru went to the station to see them off.

The distinguished guests arrived in Nangal on the morning of the 22nd. They received a very warm welcome at the station. Tens of thousands of people lined the roads leading to the Bhakra-Nangal project site to welcome the visiting Soviet leaders. Many workers at the construction site wore festive costumes and carried flags to welcome them. Farmers from East Punjab traveled from afar by various means of transportation, some even on foot, to welcome the distinguished guests. They shouted loudly, "Indians and Russians are brothers."

Bulganin, Khrushchev, and their entourage visited the construction sites in Nangal, Bhakra, and other places, guided by officials from the East Punjab Provincial Government.

They are scheduled to return from Nangal to Umballa by train on the evening of the 22nd, and then fly to Bareilly in Uttar Pradesh to visit the state-owned farm in Terai.
