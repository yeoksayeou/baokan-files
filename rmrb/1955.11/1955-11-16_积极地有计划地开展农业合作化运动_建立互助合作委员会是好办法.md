Actively and systematically carry out the agricultural cooperation movement.
Establishing mutual aid and cooperation committees is a good method.
Li Huifu

Last winter, the Women's Bridge Township in Shuangfeng County, Hunan Province, established six agricultural production cooperatives. Since then, four district cadres have been stationed in the township, and each cooperative, along with the township cadres, has one cadre detached from or semi-detached from production to lead.

In August of this year, Women's Bridge Township prepared to build two new cooperatives, and the profit distribution work of the six old cooperatives was also to be stepped up. Just at this time, three of the four district cadres were transferred to other tasks. What about the township cadres? Because the autumn harvest and autumn planting in the whole township were very tense, coupled with other economic and political work, they could not concentrate all their energy on leading the cooperatives. In this situation, the Women's Bridge Township branch of the Chinese Communist Party and the stationed cadres felt very distressed and lacked confidence in running the old cooperatives well and building the new cooperatives well. Branch Secretary Li Dixuan hoped that the district would send more cadres. Yan Zixiang, deputy branch secretary and township head, said: "There are so many cooperatives and so few cadres. I'm afraid we can't do it even if we don't sleep!"

However, the district cadres could not be expected to come, and other work tasks had to be completed. What should be done? The Party branch convened a joint meeting of the Party branch committee members and the heads of the six old cooperatives on the evening of August 20 to study this issue. In the study, a clear view was that only by relying on the masses and giving play to collective wisdom could the problem be solved. Finally, it was decided to establish a mutual aid and cooperation committee to lead the cooperative work in the whole township; the work was specifically divided, with branch secretary Li Dixuan in charge of the overall work, deputy branch secretary Yan Zixiang in charge of mutual aid and cooperation, branch committee member Luo Yuqing (credit cooperative accountant) in charge of economic work, and branch committee member and head of Shushan Agricultural Cooperative, Zou Zhuxian, was appointed as the head of the mutual aid and cooperation committee. It was stipulated that the mutual aid and cooperation committee must meet regularly, and the heads or cooperative affairs committee members of each cooperative must participate in the meetings to exchange leadership experience, study problems, and propose solutions. It was stipulated that the meetings should be held every three days when there were many problems, and every seven days when there were few problems. The meeting time was generally in the evening to avoid delaying production.

Since the adoption of this leadership method in Women's Bridge Township, many major problems of the cooperatives have been solved smoothly, and the autumn and winter production work in the whole township has been done well.

Because the six existing cooperatives in the whole township were all built last winter, none of them had experience in autumn harvest distribution. The first meeting solved the problem of autumn harvest distribution. Shushan Cooperative introduced the process of formulating the distribution plan and the matching method of various physical varieties; after discussion, the heads of each cooperative had a clear understanding of the distribution, and all made distribution plans when they returned. At the second meeting of the mutual aid and cooperation committee, the distribution plans and physical advance plans of each cooperative were checked. It was found that the rice yield of Baishu Agricultural Cooperative was estimated too low, and the labor days of Wanzhou Cooperative were not estimated realistically. Solutions were immediately studied. At the meeting, the head of Shushan Agricultural Cooperative introduced Shushan Cooperative's plan for careful harvesting, fine collection, and side harvesting, side plowing, and side autumn planting during the autumn harvest and autumn planting. After repeated discussion and research, the heads of each cooperative arranged the autumn harvest and autumn planting work when they returned.

After the implementation of the leadership method of the mutual aid and cooperation committee, the cooperative cadres gave play to their initiative and enthusiasm, and promptly did a good job in various tasks within the cooperative. Therefore, their work confidence was greatly improved. Luo Ruisheng, the head of Baishu Cooperative, originally had little prestige in the cooperative, and he was hesitant to work and did not dare to be boldly responsible. During the autumn harvest, the millet was harvested for two or three days and had not been distributed. The cooperative members were afraid that the millet would mold and blamed the head for not being responsible. Luo Ruisheng himself wanted to do this and that, and he was busy and in a very distressed state. With the help of the mutual aid and cooperation committee meeting, he became bolder in his work. He convened a cooperative committee, divided the work, actively led the cooperative members to do a good job in the distribution plan, and achieved distribution as soon as it was harvested, and properly arranged production. The cooperative members completely changed their view of him. They said: Head Luo has finally come out, the distribution is fair and reasonable, and he has done a good job as the head of the large family without any cadres coming. Luo Ruisheng himself said: "After the district cadres were transferred away, I was so anxious that I cried at the time. I couldn't do it if I did it, and I couldn't do it if I didn't do it. Now that I have come up with this good method, I not only guarantee to run this cooperative well, but I am also confident that I can lead it well even if the cooperative is expanded."

The two new cooperatives, Baizhu and Yude, were also built under the leadership of the mutual aid and cooperation committee. Originally, after the backbone of these two cooperatives returned to their hometowns after studying, they were in high spirits and took the initiative to convene mutual aid group meetings to prepare for the establishment of cooperatives. However, when they encountered some difficulties, and the district did not send full-time cadres to help, their morale was somewhat low. The Party branch promptly studied this situation and asked the mutual aid and cooperation committee to help the new cooperatives. The mutual aid and cooperation committee decided that the two old cooperatives, Shushan and Shiwu, would be specifically responsible for helping. Later, when meetings were held, the backbone of the new cooperative were absorbed to participate, and time was taken to specifically study the issue of building the cooperative. In this way, the backbone of the cooperative had confidence, and their morale rose again. When the two new cooperatives were carrying out ideological mobilization, they relied on the members of the old cooperative and used the relationship of relatives and friends to connect and mobilize; they also received timely help from the mutual aid and cooperation committee in handling specific problems. The ideological mobilization work was done very well, and the specific problems were handled basically reasonably. The two new cooperatives were successfully built on schedule. Through the leadership of the mutual aid and cooperation committee, the agricultural cooperatives also united and helped the mutual aid groups and individual farmers. Each cooperative was linked to the mutual aid groups. Among the thirty-six mutual aid groups in the whole township, eight groups were target groups for transfer to cooperatives, and they have been united into three mutual aid joint groups. The heads of the joint groups participated in the meetings of the mutual aid and cooperation committee. Other mutual aid group leaders also participated in the meetings of the agricultural cooperatives. In this way, the work of developing cooperatives in the next step is prepared.

After the basic completion of the winter planting production plan in the eight cooperatives, many cooperative members were idle at home and had nothing to do. At this time, finding a way out for the surplus labor force became a major problem. The head of Shushan Cooperative first conducted research in his own cooperative. On the premise of doing a good job in agricultural production, he drew out fifty-five laborers and, according to their respective specialties, operated side occupations such as burning charcoal, sawing pine boards, carpentry and ironwork, weaving cloth and towels, ginning cotton, blacksmithing, and transportation. After the surplus labor force of Shushan Cooperative was arranged, it was studied at the meeting of the mutual aid and cooperation committee. Zhang Xingxiang, the head of Baizhu Cooperative, said: "This work is very important. Many cooperative members reported that they could not arrange their time and had no pocket money. I originally felt that there was no way to do it, but now there is a direction." Each cooperative also made specific arrangements. Now the eight cooperatives have drawn out 179 laborers to operate various side occupations.

Due to the driving force of the agricultural cooperatives, the autumn and winter production in the whole township was in full swing. Since late August, it has not rained for nearly two months. The autumn drought was very serious, and most of the autumn planting crops were threatened by the drought. Those that were planted did not germinate, and those that germinated did not grow. Some farmers were very disappointed and lacked confidence in winter planting. Li Xichun, the head of Shiwu Cooperative, first mobilized more than 20 cooperative members in his own cooperative to water more than 20,000 sweet potato seedlings, and watered 15 mu of rapeseed and grass seeds once. This experience was promoted at the meeting of the mutual aid and cooperation committee. The eight cooperatives all used methods such as carrying water and using waterwheels to fight the autumn drought. Due to the lead of the agricultural cooperatives, three to four hundred people in the whole township were invested in the fight against drought and to protect seedlings every day, which relieved the drought of more than 350 mu of autumn planting crops, and also hoed and sowed more than 270 mu of land, making the winter planting movement go smoothly. The whole township planned to plant 2,305 mu of autumn and winter crops, accounting for 73% of the total cultivated land area. During the busy agricultural season, more than 900 people were mobilized to engage in production. In early September, the weather was hot, and more than 80 cattle plowed the fields every night, and 845 mu of buckwheat and 20 mu of potatoes were planted within a week.

    积极地有计划地开展农业合作化运动
    建立互助合作委员会是好办法
    李惠夫
    湖南省双峰县女子桥乡去年冬天建立了六个农业生产合作社。从那时候起，一直有四个区干部驻乡，加上乡干部，每个社都有一个脱离生产或半脱离生产的干部驻社领导。
    今年八月份，女子桥乡准备再建两个新社，六个老社的收益分配工作也要抓紧进行。正在这个时候，四个区干部中有三个另有任务调走了。乡干部呢？因为全乡的秋收秋种很紧张，再加上其他的经济工作和政治工作，也不能集中全部精力来领导合作社了。在这一情况下，中共女子桥乡支部和驻乡干部都感到很苦闷，对办好老社和建好新社缺乏信心。支部书记李迪轩天天盼望区上再派干部来。支部副书记兼乡长颜子香说：“社又多，干部又少，我们就是不困觉恐怕也搞不了啦！”
    可是，区干部是盼不来了，其他工作任务也必须完成，怎么办呢？党支部于八月二十日晚上召开了党支部委员和六个老社社长的联席会议，对这一问题作了研究。在研究当中明确了一个观点，就是只有依靠群众，发挥集体智慧，才能解决问题。最后决定成立互助合作委员会来领导全乡的合作社工作；并具体分工，由支部书记李迪轩负责全盘工作，副支部书记颜子香专管互助合作，支部委员罗余庆（信用社会计）专管经济工作，推定支部委员、树山农业合作社社长邹主先当互助合作委员会的负责人。规定互助合作委员会必须定期碰头，各个合作社的社长或社务委员参加碰头会，交流领导经验，研究问题，提出解决办法。碰头会的召开，规定问题多的时候三天一次，问题少的时候七天一次。碰头时间一般都在晚上进行，以免耽误生产。
    女子桥乡自从采用了这个领导办法后，合作社的不少重大问题，都顺利解决了，全乡的秋冬生产工作也搞好了。
    全乡原有的六个合作社，因为都是去年冬天建成的，都没有秋收分配的经验。第一次碰头会就解决秋收分配的问题。由树山社介绍了制定分配方案的经过和各项实物品种的搭配办法；经过讨论，各社社长对分配心里都有了底，回去都作出了分配方案。在互助合作委员会第二次碰头会上，检查了各个社的分配方案和实物预支方案，发现柏树农业合作社的水稻产量估得太低，湾洲社的劳动日估算得不实在等问题，随即就研究了解决办法。会上又由树山农业合作社社长介绍了树山社秋收秋种中细打细收和边扮禾、边翻田、边秋种的计划，经过反复讨论研究，各个社的负责人回去都布置了秋收秋种工作。
    实行互助合作委员会领导办法以后，社干部都发挥了主动性和积极性，及时搞好了社内各项工作，因而他们的工作信心也大大提高了。柏树社社长罗瑞生，原先在社内威信不高，工作束手束脚，不敢大胆负责。秋收的时候谷子收回来两三天还没有分下去，社员怕谷子霉烂，埋怨社长不负责。罗瑞生自己要搞这搞那，手忙脚乱，非常苦闷。经过互助合作委员会碰头会的帮助，他工作大胆了，回去召开了社委会，进行了分工，积极领导社员搞好了分配方案，做到了随收随分，并妥善安排了生产。社员们对他的看法完全改变了，他们说：罗社长这下操出来啦，分配搞得公平合理，没有干部来也当好了这个大家。罗瑞生自己说：“区干部调走后，当时我急得哭，干也不得了，不干也不得了，如今想出这个好办法来，我不但保证办好这个社，就是社再扩大我也有把握领导好了。”
    白竹和余德两个新社，也是在互助合作委员会领导下建成的。原来这两个社的骨干学习回乡后，情绪很高，主动召开互助组会酝酿建社。但是当碰到了一些困难以后，区里又没有派专职干部去帮助，他们的情绪就有些低落。党支部及时研究了这一情况，要求互助合作委员会帮助新建社。互助合作委员会决定由树山、石屋两个老社具体负责帮助。以后开碰头会，就吸收了建社骨干参加，抽出时间具体研究建社问题。这样一来，建社骨干有了信心，情绪又高涨起来。两个新建社在进行思想发动的时候，依靠了老社社员，利用亲戚朋友关系串联发动；处理具体问题中也得到互助合作委员会的及时帮助，思想发动工作做得很好，具体问题处理得基本合理，两个新社如期顺利建成。通过互助合作委员会的领导，农业合作社还团结和帮助了互助组和个体农民。各个合作社都同互助组挂了钩。全乡三十六个互助组中，有八个组是转社对象组，已联合成三个互助联组。联组组长都参加了互助合作委员会的碰头会。其他互助组长也参加农业合作社的会。这样，下一步发展社的工作就有准备了。
    八个社在冬种生产计划基本完成以后，许多社员闲在家里，无事可做。这时，给剩余劳力找出路成了一个大问题。树山社社长首先在自己的社里作了研究，在搞好农业生产的前提下，抽出了五十五个劳动力，根据各人的特长，经营了烧木炭、锯松板、做木工铁工、织布和毛巾、弹棉花、打铁、搞运输等副业。树山社的剩余劳力得到安排以后，就在互助合作委员会的碰头会上作了研究，白竹社社长张行香说：“这个工作很重要，许多社员反映工夫安插不了，又没有零用钱，我原来感到没办法，如今有个方向了。”各个社也都作了具体安排，现在八个社已经抽出一百七十九个劳动力经营各种副业。
    由于农业合作社的带动，全乡的秋、冬生产搞得热火朝天。八月下旬以来，将近两个月没有落雨。秋旱很严重，秋种作物大部受到了旱灾的威胁，种了的不发芽，发芽了的不长。有些农民很失望，对冬种缺乏信心。石屋社社长李喜春首先在自己社内发动了二十多个社员，浇了二万多蔸甘薯，又把十五亩油菜和草子淋了一次水。在互助合作委员会的碰头会上推广了这一经验。八个社都用担水、车水等办法，同秋旱展开了斗争。由于农业合作社的带头，全乡每天有三、四百人投入抗旱保苗斗争，解除了三百五十多亩秋种作物的旱象，还用锄头挖播了二百七十多亩田，使冬种运动顺利开展起来。全乡计划要种二千三百零五亩秋冬作物，占总耕地面积的百分之七十三。在农活紧张时期，曾出动九百多人搞生产。九月上旬天气热，每天晚上有八十多头牛翻田，一个星期内就种上了八百四十五亩荞麦，二十亩马铃薯。
