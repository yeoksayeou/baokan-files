Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 16th: According to TASS, Norwegian Prime Minister Gerhardsen held a press conference on November 15 at the Norwegian Embassy in Moscow.

In answering questions from reporters, the Norwegian Prime Minister said that Norway was very satisfied with the results of the Norwegian delegation's negotiations with Soviet state leaders. The reception the delegation received in Moscow and the results of the negotiations are a new stage in relations between the Soviet Union and Norway. The achievements made in the negotiations will help promote mutual understanding and improve relations between the two countries.

Gerhardsen emphasized that the expansion of trade between the Soviet Union and Norway is entirely conditional, and that both sides are taking advantage of these conditions. Gerhardsen also said that during the Moscow talks, the Norwegian delegation raised the issue of Norwegians who may be detained in the Soviet Union, including those who fought against the Soviet Union together with the Hitlerite gang. He pointed out that the Norwegian delegation received a satisfactory reply on this issue.

Regarding the issue of foreign bases on Norwegian territory, Gerhardsen pointed out that as long as Norway is not subjected to aggression or the threat of aggression, the Norwegian government will not provide bases on Norwegian territory for foreign armed forces. He also said that the Norwegian people very warmly hope that one day, due to disarmament and the establishment of mutual supervision, the establishment of bases will become unnecessary.

    新华社十六日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：挪威首相基哈德森十一月十五日在挪威驻莫斯科大使馆举行了记者招待会。
    挪威首相在回答记者们提出的问题时说，挪威代表团同苏联国家领导人谈判的结果，使挪威感到很满意。代表团在莫斯科受到的接待和谈判的结果，是苏联和挪威两国的关系中的新阶段。谈判中获得的成果将有助于促进两国之间的相互了解和改善两国之间的关系。
    基哈德森强调说，苏联和挪威两国扩大贸易是完全有条件的，而且双方正在利用这些条件。基哈德森还说，在莫斯科会谈中，挪威代表团提到了可能被拘留在苏联的、其中包括同希特勒匪帮一起对苏联作战的那些挪威人的问题。他指出，在这个问题上，挪威代表团得到了满意的答复。
    关于挪威领土上的外国基地的问题，基哈德森指出，只要挪威不遭受到侵略或者侵略的威胁，挪威政府不在挪威的领土上为外国武装部队提供基地。他还说，挪威人民非常热烈地希望将来能有一天由于裁军和建立互相监督而使建立基地成为不必要的事情。
