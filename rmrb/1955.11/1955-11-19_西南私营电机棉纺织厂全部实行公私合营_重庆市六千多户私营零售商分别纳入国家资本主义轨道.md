Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, November 18th: Chongqing's private Weichang Yarn Factory was incorporated into Yuhua Textile Factory on the 14th to implement joint public-private ownership. With this, all 21 private motor and cotton textile factories in Southwest China have been merged into 15 joint public-private cotton mills.

The Southwest motor textile industry developed blindly before liberation. Its spinning capacity exceeded its weaving capacity, and its weaving capacity was greater than its printing and dyeing capacity. Therefore, production in spinning, weaving, and dyeing was unbalanced. In the process of joint public-private ownership, the Southwest motor cotton industry successively added more than 2,500 automatic looms, and the state invested in expanding a larger dyeing factory at the 610 Factory. The Southwest Textile Industry Management Department also uniformly planned the improvement of machinery and equipment in all joint public-private cotton textile factories in the region. It led the factories to replace the original old and broken spindles with new spindles, changed the old-fashioned spinning machines into high-speed, smoothly running large-draft spinning machines, and added some technical equipment and safety equipment. This not only changed the imbalance between various processes, but also improved the quality of yarn and cloth, saved cotton, and reduced costs. In the first three quarters of this year, the six cotton mills in Chongqing saved more than 69,000 kilograms of raw cotton, and the number of first-class yarns produced increased from one or two in the past to eight or nine. The labor cost per piece of yarn has been reduced from about 150 yuan before joint public-private ownership to about 110 yuan currently. Due to the rational arrangement of administrative management and technical personnel after joint public-private ownership, the leadership and management strength and technical strength of each factory have been greatly enhanced. After the factories uniformly carried out the production division of yarn and cloth varieties and colors, the quality of the products also improved.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, November 18th: Among the more than 7,400 private retailers in Chongqing, more than 6,700 have been placed on various forms of state capitalism. Among them, retailers engaged in grain, cotton cloth, paint, sugar, wine, tobacco, and other seven industries have been transformed into consignment stores and distribution stores of state-owned companies. Retailers in department stores, slaughtering, coal, traditional Chinese medicine, shoes and hats, and other industries have also purchased goods from state-owned companies. The retailers in the above-mentioned industries are closely related to people's daily life, and their number of households and business volume account for about 80% or more of the city's private retail stores.

A large part of Chongqing's private retailers are family stores. These family stores have small funds, are operated in a scattered manner, and generally have no established systems. Since the third quarter of this year, state-owned companies have helped private retail stores establish various necessary accounting, learning, and other systems, guiding them to improve their operations and reduce unnecessary expenses. The monthly expenses of 480 retail stores such as cotton cloth, stationery, paint, and medicine merchants have been reduced by more than 13,000 yuan compared with before February in recent months. The Municipal Bureau of Commerce has also sent cadres to guide employees of private retail stores to study current affairs and policies. Currently, more than 4,000 employees are participating in formal studies.

　　西南私营电机棉纺织厂全部实行公私合营
　　重庆市六千多户私营零售商分别纳入国家资本主义轨道
    新华社重庆十八日电　重庆私营维昌纱厂十四日并入裕华纺织厂实行公私合营，到此，西南地区所有的二十一家私营电机棉纺织厂已经分别合并为十五个公私合营棉纺厂。
    西南电机纺织业是在解放前盲目发展起来的。它的纺纱能力超过织布能力，而织布能力又大于印染能力。因此，在纺、织、染三方面的生产不能平衡。西南电机棉纺业在公私合营过程中，先后增设了两千五百多台自动织布机，国家在六一零厂投资扩建了一座较大的染厂。西南纺织工业管理部门还统一规划了全区公私合营棉纺织厂的机器设备的改进工作。领导各厂用新锭换去了原来陈旧破烂的纱锭，把旧式的纺纱机都改变成了速度快、运转正常的大牵伸纺纱机，还增添了部分技术设备和安全设备。这样不但改变了各种工序之间的不平衡状态，而且提高了纱布的质量，节约了用棉，降低了成本。今年前三个季度，重庆地区的六个棉纺厂就节约了原棉六万九千多公斤，生产的甲等纱已由过去的一、二种增加到八、九种。每件纱的工缴成本已由公私合营前的一百五十元降低为目前的一百一十元左右。由于公私合营以后合理安排了行政管理和技术人员，大大增强了各厂的领导管理力量和技术力量。各厂统一进行了纱、布的品种、花色的生产分工以后，产品的质量也提高了。
    新华社重庆十八日电　在重庆市七千四百多户私营零售商中，已经有六千七百多户分别纳入各种形式的国家资本主义轨道。其中经营粮食、棉布、颜料、食糖、酒、烟等七个行业的零售商已经改造成为国营公司的代销店和经销店；百货、屠宰、煤、国药、鞋帽等行业的零售商也已经向国营公司批购商品。上述行业的零售商同人民日常生活关系密切，他们的户数和营业额在全市私营零售座商中大约占到百分之八十以上。
    重庆市私营零售商中，很大一部分是家庭商店。这些家庭商店资金小，经营分散，一般都没有建立制度。自今年第三季度以来，各国营公司帮助私营零售商店建立各种必要的会计、学习等制度，指导他们改善经营，减少不必要的费用。棉布、文具、油漆、药商等四百八十户零售商店最近几个月来，每月开支都比二月份前减少了一万三千多元。市商业局还派出干部指导私营零售商从业人员学习时事和政策，目前参加正规学习的从业人员有四千多人。
