Xinhua News Agency report: The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held an enlarged meeting of the Municipal Committee to convey and discuss the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party.

　　Based on the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation," the meeting discussed and reviewed the agricultural cooperation movement in the suburbs of Beijing. The meeting believed that the agricultural cooperation movement in the suburbs of Beijing had implemented the Party Central Committee's policies in recent years, was basically healthy, and was developing rapidly while constantly consolidating. However, some serious shortcomings and errors had also occurred in the suburban agricultural cooperation movement, mainly in the great development from last winter to this spring, when serious errors of infringing upon the interests of middle peasants and subjectively and blindly pursuing advanced forms and running excessively large cooperatives without paying much attention to the quality of the cooperatives occurred. Since January of this year, the Municipal Committee has emphasized the implementation of the policy of voluntary mutual benefit and corrected the problem of infringing upon the interests of middle peasants. The focus of suburban work has shifted to fully consolidating existing agricultural producers' cooperatives and vigorously increasing the production of agricultural producers' cooperatives, so that these shortcomings and errors have been corrected in a timely manner. The vast majority of existing cooperatives have been well-managed. The meeting believed that a new upsurge in the agricultural cooperation movement has now emerged in the suburbs, and the Party organizations in Beijing must actively lead this movement in accordance with the Party Central Committee's resolution and the principles and steps instructed by Comrade Mao Zedong to ensure the healthy development and continuous progress of the agricultural cooperation movement and continuously improve its quality.

　　The meeting proposed that after this new upsurge this winter and next spring, the number of peasant households joining agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs should develop to account for about 70 percent of the total number of peasant households. Some townships have now basically achieved cooperation, and there will be more such townships in the future. Among these cooperatives, a number are advanced cooperatives of a socialist nature, a number are large cooperatives with more than 300 households, and there are several large collective farms with more than 1,000 households that basically use machinery for farming. The Municipal Committee, suburban district committees, and township branches must earnestly strengthen their leadership and gain typical experimental experience in agricultural producers' cooperatives of various sizes and natures.

　　The meeting believed that all major tasks in Beijing should immediately begin to formulate comprehensive plans in accordance with the principle of "overall planning and strengthened leadership" instructed by the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong.

　　The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China also held a meeting of Party member cadres on November 12, at which Peng Zhen conveyed the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party and reported on how to more appropriately transform private industry and commerce.

　　北京市委传达和讨论党的六中全会决议
    据新华社讯　中共北京市委员会在最近召开市委扩大会议，传达和讨论了党的七届六中全会（扩大）的决议。
    会议根据党的七届六中全会的决议和毛泽东同志“关于农业合作化问题”的报告，讨论和检查了北京郊区的农业合作化运动。会议认为：几年来北京市郊区农业合作化运动贯彻执行了党中央的方针，基本上是健康的，是在不断巩固中迅速发展的。但是，郊区农业合作化运动中也曾经发生过一些严重的缺点和错误，主要是在去冬今春的大发展中，曾经发生过严重地侵犯中农利益的错误和主观地、盲目地追求高级形式和过多地办大社而不很注意合作社质量的偏向。从今年一月以来，市委强调贯彻执行自愿互利政策，纠正侵犯中农的毛病，郊区工作重心转入了全力巩固现有农业生产合作社、大力提高农业生产合作社的生产，使这些缺点和错误及时得到纠正。现有的社绝大多数都已经办好。会议认为：目前郊区已经出现了农业合作化运动的新高潮，北京市党的组织必须按照党中央的决议和毛泽东同志指示的方针和步骤，积极领导这个运动，以保证农业合作化运动的健康发展和不断前进，不断地提高质量。
    会议提出，郊区农业合作社入社农户经过今冬明春这个新高潮，就要发展到占农户总数的百分之七十左右，有些乡现在已经基本上合作化，今后这样的乡还会更多，这些合作社中有一批是社会主义性质的高级社，有一批是三百户以上的大社，并且有几个一千户以上的基本上使用机器耕地的大的集体农庄，市委、郊区区委和乡支部，都必须切实加强领导，取得对各种规模和性质的农业生产合作社的典型试验经验。
    会议认为：北京市的各项主要工作都应该根据党中央和毛泽东同志指示的“全面规划，加强领导”的方针，立即着手制订全面的规划。
    中共北京市委又在十一月十二日召开党员干部会议，会上由彭真传达了党的七届六中全会（扩大）的决议和报告了关于如何更适当地改造私营工商业问题。
