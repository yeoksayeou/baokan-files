It is necessary to properly settle the elderly, widowed, and childless.
　　In Jingxi Township, Minhou County, Fujian Province, 82% of farmers have joined agricultural production cooperatives. Among the 76 households remaining outside the cooperatives, 39 are elderly, widowed, and childless individuals with very weak or no labor power. In the past, these people mainly relied on relatives and friends to cultivate their land or hired laborers. Now that most people in the township have joined cooperatives, it is difficult for them to rely on relatives and friends or hire laborers.

　　Most of these elderly, widowed, and childless households are willing to join the cooperatives, but the leading cadres and many members of the cooperatives are afraid of being burdened and are unwilling to accept them. The Jingxi Township Party Branch recognized this problem and educated the party members and activists within the cooperatives. At the same time, they made unified arrangements for the elderly, widowed, and childless households based on the specific conditions of each cooperative. The arrangements were as follows: For those who can engage in light labor, the cooperatives should try their best to find them suitable work based on their needs. For those who are completely unable to work, some cooperatives allow their relatives and friends to participate in labor in the cooperative for a certain period of time, and credit the work points they earn to the elderly, widowed, and childless household's account, and then distribute dividends uniformly. Others are taken care of by the cooperative, providing for them in life and burying them after death.

　　Through this unified arrangement, 31 of the 39 elderly, widowed, and childless households in the township have joined six cooperatives.

　  要适当安置孤寡户
    福建省闽侯县荆溪乡百分之八十二的农户都参加了农业生产合作社；留在社外的七十六户农民中，劳力很弱和无劳力的孤寡户就有三十九户。这些人的田地过去主要依靠亲友耕作或雇人耕作，现在全乡大部分人都入了合作社，他们再要依靠亲友或雇人耕作就很困难了。
    这些孤寡户大多数都愿意入社，但是社的领导骨干和很多社员怕受拖累，不愿意吸收他们入社。荆溪乡党支部看到了这个问题，对党员和社内的积极分子进行了教育，同时按各个社的具体条件对孤寡户进行了统一的安排。安排的办法是，对于能够从事轻微劳动的，由社内根据需要尽量给他们找些适当的活做。对完全不能劳动的，有的社是允许他们的亲友来社参加一定时间的劳动，把他所得工分记在这户孤寡户的账上，以后统一分红；有的是由社包下来，生时管养活，死了管埋葬。
    经过这样统一安排，全乡三十九户孤寡户已经有三十一户分别加入了六个合作社。
