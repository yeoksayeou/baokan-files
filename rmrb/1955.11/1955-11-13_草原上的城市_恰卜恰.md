　　Prairie City - Qabqia
　　By Our Correspondent Li Gendi
    Like other parts of the motherland, minority areas are also undergoing tremendous changes. Qabqia is a prairie city that is rising in the south of Qinghai Lake.
    Qabqia is located on the highway from Xining to Yushu, in a small agricultural area with both animal husbandry, surrounded by pastoral areas. It is the political center of the Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture and the political and economic center of the Republic County. A few years ago, the staff who came here had to bring tents, but now rows of new houses have appeared. On the east bank of the Qabqia River, county and state-level agencies and state-owned enterprises such as state-owned trading companies, the People's Bank, and post and telecommunications bureaus have been established, as well as a newly built Hainan Cadre School and a small factory that can produce 200,000 to 300,000 bricks and tiles per month. The west bank of the Qabqia River is a newly built private commercial area with tailor shops, restaurants, shoe shops, mule and horse shops, blacksmiths, and barbershops. Next to the private commercial area are the People's Hospital and supply and marketing cooperatives. Looking south from here to the other bank, is the veterinary station and the livestock products purchasing organization under construction.
    Over the past few years, the People's Bank, located here, has strongly supported the development of animal husbandry. The amount of funds it lent last year was equal to the sum of the previous three years. The staff also specifically helped herdsmen purchase 5,500 sheep and goats. Like farmers who got land, livestock-free households now have their own livestock. This year, the People's Bank plans to issue another 30,000 yuan in livestock loans. It is estimated that after this support, all the grasslands in the Republic County will be herders with livestock.
    Since 1950, the veterinary station has been going deep into pastoral areas to prevent and control livestock diseases using scientific methods. In the past, the focus was on treatment, but now it is possible to shift to vigorous prevention. This year, it is estimated that 67,000 head of livestock can be prevented from getting sick.
    Trading companies and supply and marketing cooperatives purchase livestock hides, wool, butter and other livestock products from herdsmen at reasonable prices, and supply daily necessities, improving the lives of herdsmen. In the past, herdsmen were very satisfied to get cheap cloth, Fu tea, red and white sugar, and rock sugar; now it is different. They need high-grade flannel, all kinds of exquisite candies, require Sichuan cigarettes to replace Qinghai dry tobacco, and use Matty lamps for lighting. In order to meet market demands, trading companies and supply and marketing cooperatives are trying their best to increase the variety of goods they operate. On the shelves are teapots made of copper, tin, and those with metal patterns, as well as milk jars, baby carriages, hand-cranked sewing machines, flashlights, and even imported meat grinders. The supply and marketing cooperatives have successively established eight fixed grassroots societies, and also organized many mobile trade groups, using yaks, mules, and large carts to transport hundreds of tons of materials to tents, supplementing the shortcomings of grassroots society store transactions.
    In addition to treating patients of all ethnic groups, the People's Hospital in Qabqia also promotes health knowledge to grassland residents. The post and telecommunications bureau connects here with all parts of the motherland. More than 120 kinds of magazines and thousands of newspapers and letters are sent from cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Xi'an, and Xining to Qabqia every month, and then distributed to agencies, tent schools, and monasteries. Many male and female herdsmen also send letters and telegrams to the post and telecommunications bureau, sending them to friends and relatives far away in Beijing, Lhasa, and Xigaze.
    In order to better serve the people of all ethnic groups in pastoral areas, the agencies and enterprises located in Qabqia are continuing to improve their work in all aspects. The trading company has Tibetan salespeople, the People's Hospital recruits male and female Tibetans to study medical services, and the Han staff of the post and telecommunications bureau have not had time to learn Tibetan. When Tibetans come, the post and telecommunications bureau immediately looks for translators, and the director and other staff help write letters and telegrams. Postal carriers always carry stamps on their trips, bringing back to Qabqia letters, telegrams and packages that they encounter herdsmen along the way who want to send.
    It is not difficult to imagine how happy the people living here are when a prairie that has not had a city for thousands of years suddenly has a city!
    Now, the herdsmen on the grassland are proud of the rise of Qabqia. Male and female herdsmen yell at yaks or ride fast horses, sell livestock products here, and buy their favorite items. They look at the cars from Xining to Yushu, count the newly built houses on the banks of the Qabqia River, and admire the patches of lush green trees that have grown on the once bare ground.
    The herdsmen returning from Qabqia talk everywhere about the various news they see: what new goods the department store has, a new shop is being built on the river bank, and the walls of the hospital are painted bright red. Every piece of news excites people. Young men and women dance in front of the tents for the growing prosperity of Qabqia, and the children clamor to see it in person. Friends shake each other's shoulders and ask: "Have you been to Qabqia? It has become so good!" The old herdsmen praised: "Chairman Mao is so good, he has made our Qabqia as good as Huangyuan City."
    The emergence of the new town of Qabqia on the prairie, its significance is far from being expressed by a few houses and shops. Its emergence marks the beginning of a new era on the prairie, and the prairie will gradually move towards economic prosperity and cultural upsurge. The emergence and development of Qabqia shows that the Party is unremittingly helping minority nationalities build their new lives. Qabqia is a powerful bugle, it inspires the herdsmen on the grassland to move forward.

### 草原上的城市——恰卜恰

　　草原上的城市——恰卜恰
　　本报记者　李根蒂
    和祖国其他地区一样，少数民族聚居地区也在发生着巨大变化。恰卜恰是青海湖南部正在兴起的一座草原城市。
    恰卜恰在西宁通玉树的公路线上，为兼有畜牧业的小块农业区，四面围靠着牧区。这儿是海南藏族自治州的政治中心，又是共和县政治、经济中心，几年前来到这里的机关工作人员还要带着帐篷，现在已出现了一排排新建房屋。在恰卜恰河东岸，县级、州级各机关和国营贸易公司、人民银行、邮电局等国营企业办公用房都已建立起来，还有一所新盖的海南干部学校和一座每月可产二、三十万块砖瓦的小型工厂。恰卜恰河西岸是新建的私营商业区域，有裁缝铺、饭馆、绱鞋铺、骡马店、铁匠炉、理发馆。靠着私营商业区的还有人民医院和供销合作社。从这儿向对岸偏南看去，就是兽医工作站和正在修建的畜产品收购机构。
    几年来，设在这里的人民银行有力地扶助了畜牧业的发展。它去年所贷放的资金数量等于前三年的总和。工作人员还具体帮助牧民购进五千五百只绵羊和山羊。同农民得到土地一样，无畜户有了自己的牲畜。今年，人民银行准备再发放三万元牲畜贷款，估计经过这次扶持，全共和县的草原上就都是有牲畜的牧民了。
    兽医工作站从一九五零年开始，分途深入牧区，用科学方法防治牲畜疾病。过去以治疗为主，现在已经有可能转入大力预防了。今年，估计可以预防六万七千头牲畜患病。
    贸易公司、供销社用合理的价格收购牧民的畜皮、羊毛、奶油和其他畜产品，供应生活必需品，改善了牧民的生活。过去牧民得到廉价的布匹、茯茶和红、白糖、冰糖就已十分满意；现在不同了，他们需要高级绒布、各类精致糖果，要求用四川卷烟代替青海旱烟，照明要用马提灯。贸易公司、供销合作社适应市场要求，正在尽力增加经营的物资品种。货架上摆着的茶壶就有铜的、锡的，以及带有金属花纹的，还有盛奶缸、小孩推车、手摇缝纫机、电筒，直到进口的搅肉机。供销合作社先后建立了八个固定的基层社，还组织了许多流动的贸易小组，利用牦牛、骡子、大车把成百吨的物资运往帐篷，补充基层社门市交易的不足。
    恰卜恰的人民医院除为各民族病人治病以外，还向草原居民宣传卫生知识。邮电局沟通了这里同祖国各地的交往。每月有一百二十多种杂志、数千份报纸和信件从北京、天津、上海、西安、西宁等城市送到恰卜恰，再分散投送到机关、帐篷小学和寺院里。也有不少的男、女牧民把信件和电报送到邮电局，发往远在北京、拉萨、日喀则的朋友和亲属。
    设在恰卜恰的各机关企业为了更好地为牧区各族人民服务，正在继续从各方面改进工作。贸易公司有了藏民售货员，人民医院吸收男、女藏民学习医务，邮电局汉族工作人员还没来得及学会藏话，藏民来了，邮电局立即去找翻译，局长和其他工作人员一起帮助写信和代写电报。邮运员旅途往返总是带着邮票，把顺路碰上牧民要发的信件、电报和包裹捎回恰卜恰。
    一个千百年没有城市的草原，突然出现了城市，不难想像，居住在这里的人们该是多么高兴！
    现在，草原上的牧民为恰卜恰的兴起而骄傲。男女牧民吆着牦牛或骑着快马，在这里出卖了畜产品，买进自己心爱的物品。他们瞅着从西宁开往玉树的汽车，数着恰卜恰河畔新盖的房子，欣赏着从前光秃的地上长出的一片一片浓绿的树林。
    从恰卜恰归来的牧民到处谈论着看到的各种新闻：百货公司有了什么新货物，河畔上盖起一座新商铺，医院的墙壁涂上鲜红的颜色。每条新闻都激奋着人心。青年男女们为恰卜恰的日益繁荣在帐篷前舞蹈，孩子们吵着要亲自去看看。朋友们互相摇着肩膀询问：“你可曾去过恰卜恰吗？那儿变得多好呀！”老牧民赞叹着：“毛主席太好了，把咱恰卜恰变得和湟源城一样咧。”
    恰卜恰这个新市镇出现在草原上，它的意义远不是几座房屋、商店所能表现的，它的出现，标志着一个新的时代在草原开始了，草原将逐步走向经济繁荣和文化的高涨。恰卜恰的出现和发展，说明党在坚持不懈地帮助少数民族建设自己新的生活。恰卜恰是一个有力的号角，它鼓舞着草原上的牧民前进。
