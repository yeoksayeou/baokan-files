The Dachen Island, standing tall on the Zhejiang sea, is the frontier of the motherland's defense. It not only has a beautiful field where grain crops can be planted, but also a vast ocean around it with inexhaustible fishery resources.

More than nine months ago, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops were entrenched on this island, fantasizing about using it as a base for "counterattacking the mainland." They engaged in shameless acts everywhere, robbing merchant ships passing by, and often kidnapping fishermen to serve as cannon fodder.

Dachen has finally returned to the embrace of the people. However, Dachen Island after liberation presented a desolate scene, as all the residents had been abducted by the Chiang bandits and large areas of houses were burned down... Now, although only a few months have passed since liberation, under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, Dachen has gradually been reborn. Groups of immigrants have been relocated from the mainland of the motherland, and members of agricultural production cooperatives and handicraft laborers have also been transferred to the island to engage in production on a temporary basis. They are actively engaged in production and participating in the glorious work of building the island. The fishermen who came to the island earlier earned more than 200 yuan during the spring fishing season (April to June), with an average of more than 120 yuan. Three clothing workers who came to the island to produce for less than three months bought new sewing machines.

In the early days of liberation, Dachen did not have passenger ships to and from the mainland, and transportation was not convenient. With the increasing prosperity of the island, there are now regular passenger ships. People here can read the latest newspapers and learn about the construction of various parts of the motherland. Xinhua Bookstore and health clinics have also been established long ago.

The supply and marketing cooperative on the island originally had only two stores, but now it has been expanded to three large stores. The supply of goods has also increased from 185 kinds to 569 kinds. The main goods, such as general merchandise, cloth, cigarettes, wine, candy, and salted fish, can fully meet the needs of the troops and residents.

The winter fishing season is approaching. In addition to the fishermen on the island, fishermen from many nearby places will also come to the island to produce. In the ruins burned down by the Chiang bandits, a spacious processing plant has been newly built. Workers are busy rushing to make tools to welcome the processing of winter fishing products. The storm warning station forecasts storm information every day to ensure the safety of fishermen's production.

　　新生的大陈岛
　　林霓
    屹立在浙江海面的大陈岛是祖国国防的前哨。它不仅有一片美好的田野，可以种植粮食作物，周围辽阔的海洋里还有取之不竭的渔业财富。
    九个多月前，蒋贼军还盘踞在这个岛上，幻想作为“反攻大陆”的据点，他们到处干着无耻的勾当，抢劫来往商船，经常把渔民绑去充当炮灰。
    大陈终于回到人民的怀抱了。但是刚解放后的大陈岛，因全部居民被蒋贼劫光，成片的民房被烧毁……，遗留下来的是满目凄凉景象。现在解放虽然才只几个月，在党和人民政府的领导下，大陈已经逐步得到了新生。从祖国的大陆迁来了一批一批的移民，还调来了临时来岛上生产的农业生产合作社社员和手工业劳动者。他们积极投入生产，参加建设海岛的光荣工作。先来到岛上的渔民在春汛生产中（四月至六月），有的分得了二百多元，平均也分得一百二十多元。有三个成衣工人来岛上生产不到三个月，便购买了新的缝纫机。
    解放初期，大陈还没有同大陆来往的客轮，交通不够便利。随着岛上的日益繁荣，现在已经有了定期往返的客轮了。人们在这里可以看到近日的报纸，了解祖国各地建设的情况。新华书店和卫生所也都早已建立起来。
    岛上的供销站原来只有两个门市部，现在已经扩大到三个宏大的门市部了，供应的商品也从一百八十五种增加到五百六十九种，主要货品，如百货、布匹、烟、酒、糖果、咸鱼等都能充分满足部队和居民的需要。
    冬汛即将到来，除岛上渔民外，附近许多地方的渔民也将来岛上生产。在被蒋贼烧毁的废墟中，已新建了一座宽敞的加工厂房，工人忙碌地赶制着工具，迎接冬汛渔产品的加工。风暴站每天预告有无风暴消息，保障了渔民生产的安全。
