　　The Jian Guo Agricultural Production Cooperative in Gang Gou Township, Licheng County, Shandong Province, had four publicly owned livestock and nine privately raised livestock when it expanded to forty-four households last autumn. The public livestock required a total of 20,000 jin of fodder before the wheat harvest the following year. The cooperative decided to retain 10,000 jin from the autumn harvest straw and have the new members contribute the remainder as an investment, but the fodder remained in the possession of individual members. The cooperative did not manage the fodder for privately raised livestock, which the members were responsible for arranging themselves. By the time spring plowing began, the fodder stored by the cooperative was used up, and the fodder invested by the new members had also been burned as firewood. As a result, the cooperative had to spend over 300 yuan to buy fodder, increasing production costs. Members also sold three privately raised livestock due to a lack of fodder, causing more than 20 mu of spring land to not be plowed in time.
    
    This year, they learned from last year's experience. During the wheat harvest, the cooperative management committee decided to keep the wheat straw and wheat bran within the cooperative as fodder, and the fodder for members' privately owned livestock was also arranged by the cooperative in a unified manner. After the autumn harvest began, they promptly studied the issue of fodder storage. Now, this cooperative has expanded to seventy households, with nine publicly raised cattle and six privately raised donkeys. A total of over 61,000 jin of fodder is required until the next summer harvest. The wheat straw, wheat bran, and the stalks, leaves, and bran of sorghum, corn, millet, and other crops stored during the wheat and autumn harvests already amount to over 52,000 jin, leaving a shortage of just over 8,000 jin. This will be made up by the new members as a share investment.

    Because the cooperative management committee has planned and resolved the livestock fodder problem early on, the new and old members are all very settled and believe that the feeding of livestock and the timely spring plowing production are guaranteed. If the masses are willing, places with similar situations and problems can also do this.

　  统筹饲草
    山东历城县港沟乡建国农业生产合作社去年秋天扩大到四十四户的时候，社内共有公有牲口四头，社员私养牲口九头。公有牲口到第二年麦收前共需饲草两万斤，社内除从秋收柴草中留一万斤以外，其余决定由新社员凑集，作为投资，但仍由社员各自保存。私养牲口由社员自己筹划，社内不管。赶到今年春耕开始，社内存草喂光的时候，新社员投资的草也当柴烧完了，结果社内不得不花三百多元买饲草，增加了生产成本。社员私养牲口也因缺草卖掉三头，使二十多亩春地没有及时耕种。
    今年他们接受了去年的教训，麦收的时候社管理委员会就决定把麦穰、麦糠留在社内作饲草，社员私有牲口饲草也由社内统一安排。秋收开始以后，又及时研究了饲草的储备问题。现在，这个社已经扩大到七十户，社内公养牛九头，社员私养驴六头，到明年夏收共需饲草六万一千多斤，麦秋两季所储备的麦穰、麦糠和高粱、玉米、谷子等作物的秸、叶、糠等已有五万二千多斤，还差八千多斤，由新社员凑集补齐，作为股金。
    由于社管理委员会有计划地及早地解决了牲口饲草问题，新老社员情绪都很安定，认为喂养牲口和按时春耕生产都有了保证。凡有类似情况和问题的地方，如果群众愿意，也可以这样办。
