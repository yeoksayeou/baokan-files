To gradually cultivate the habit and atmosphere of learning, using, and spreading Putonghua throughout the army.

Army newspapers, books, and daily writing should improve the quality of writing, so that it becomes a model for the standardization of Chinese. Language teachers should strengthen their studies, constantly improve their language knowledge, and specifically implement it into their teaching work. The relevant departments should actively prepare for the horizontal arrangement and writing of newspapers, magazines, books, official documents, and letters, and gradually realize them.
