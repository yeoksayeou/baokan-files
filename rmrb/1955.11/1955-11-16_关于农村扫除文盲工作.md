On the Work of Eliminating Illiteracy in Rural Areas
Hu Yaobang

    This is a portion of my speeches regarding the issue of eliminating illiteracy in rural areas, delivered at the Fourth Plenary Session of the Second Central Committee of the Communist Youth League on October 16, 1955, at a meeting with Beijing reporters on the morning of October 28, and at a meeting of secretaries of All-China Youth Federations from various regions on the afternoon of the same day. I have now combined and organized these excerpts as a reference for conducting the work of eliminating illiteracy in various locations. - The Author

      I. Strategic Task

    When discussing the comprehensive plan for agricultural collectivization, the Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party pointed out that the work of eliminating illiteracy must be incorporated into the plan. This is one of the strategically significant tasks for implementing the socialist transformation of agriculture.

    Why is it called a strategic task?

    A large number of illiterate people still exist in our rural areas. Among the one hundred million young people alone, about seventy million are illiterate or semi-literate. The existence of this phenomenon seriously hinders the progress of farmers and creates great difficulties for the development of agricultural collectivization. For example, some cooperatives now have unclear accounts because farmers are uneducated and lack accountants with certain cultural knowledge. Farmers call this kind of account "conscience account," which powerfully proves this point. With the development of agricultural collectivization and the improvement of the living standards of the broad masses of farmers, the vast number of farmers, especially young farmers, urgently demand to learn culture. Therefore, the Central Committee pointed out that this serious problem must be solved in the process of agricultural collectivization, and it can only be solved in the process of agricultural collectivization. If we earnestly solve this problem, it will help promote the victorious development of agricultural collectivization.

    The problem is not only this. From the third five-year plan onwards, our country will use mechanized farming on a large scale in rural areas. By 1967, it is estimated that the area of mechanized farming will account for about 47 percent of the total cultivated land. The electrification of rural areas will also gradually develop. Therefore, our generation of rural youth must have a higher level of culture so that they can skillfully drive all kinds of "iron oxen" in the near future and fundamentally change the face of the countryside.

      II. Natural Assistant

    The Communist Youth League is the "natural assistant" of the Party and the government in this serious task of eliminating illiteracy.

    This is a sentence from Stalin. Stalin's words are very pertinent. Because learning culture is primarily the urgent demand of young people, and our Party and country are precisely placing the task of mastering culture on the shoulders of young people.

    Since the Communist Youth League is the natural assistant of the Party and the government in the work of eliminating illiteracy, we should be serious and responsible and actively undertake this work. All comrades of the League must understand that if the Communist Youth League does not earnestly solve the problems that the broad masses of young people urgently need to solve, it will become divorced from the masses. If a revolutionary organization like the Communist Youth League becomes divorced from the masses, it will not be able to actively struggle for socialism and will have no value in existence.

    In recent years, many League organizations have done a lot of things in the work of eliminating illiteracy and organizing youth to study, which is very good; but there are also many League organizations that do not care much about the learning of young people and have not done any work, which is very bad.

    Building socialism is a serious struggle, and we cannot be sloppy. The work of eliminating illiteracy is also a serious struggle, and we cannot be sloppy. Those who have done well should be praised; those who have not done well should be criticized. Criticism and self-criticism are particularly important in the process of socialist construction and socialist transformation. Comrades of the Communist Youth League, in the work of eliminating illiteracy, like in all other work, must learn to master the weapon of criticism and self-criticism. For those negative and harmful things, we must boldly and courageously put forward suggestions and criticisms; if there are shortcomings and errors in our work, we should bravely admit them and eliminate and correct them.

    III. Comprehensive Planning

    "There must be comprehensive planning," this is a famous slogan put forward by Chairman Mao in his report in July of this year. With comprehensive planning, we can lead actively, with foresight, and systematically, and we can achieve victory carefully and steadily.

    The work of eliminating illiteracy also needs a comprehensive plan at the national, provincial, county, and township levels.

    After several months of investigation and research, we believe that the following outline can be tentatively formulated for eliminating illiteracy among young people nationwide: In seven years, from this year to 1962, about 80 percent of the illiterate youth nationwide will be lifted out of illiteracy and each of them will recognize about 1,500 characters.

    The minimum standard for eliminating illiteracy among young people is set at about 1,500 characters because only in this way can they understand popular books and periodicals; only if they can understand popular books and periodicals can they conduct self-study, consolidate the results of eliminating illiteracy, and connect with future enrollment in spare-time higher primary schools. And generally, young people need about a year and a half of spare time to be able to read, write, and use 1,500 characters.

    The proportion of youth to be lifted out of illiteracy is set at about 80 percent because the work of eliminating illiteracy can only be carried out on a voluntary basis for the time being. Among young people, some may not be able to study due to physical disabilities, chronic illnesses, or other reasons, or may not be able to persist in studying to the end, and there may be a very small number of people who are unwilling to study, and they cannot be allowed to enter primary schools for compulsory education for the time being. If we set the proportion at 100 percent, but there are actually no necessary conditions to guarantee it, then we will commit the error of subjectivism and formalism.

    If the work of eliminating illiteracy among young people is completed in 1962 according to the above standards, it is entirely possible. This is because, as has already been said above, (1) the socialist consciousness of the vast number of young people has greatly improved, and they have a strong desire not to be "blind people"; (2) there are now more than 30 million young people in rural areas who have completely shaken off illiteracy, and they are a powerful force on which we can rely to carry out the work of eliminating illiteracy on a large scale and victoriously; (3) it generally takes a year and a half to make a young illiterate recognize 1,500 characters, so seven years can be quadrupled. The Soviet Union also eliminated illiteracy in the agricultural collectivization movement, and by 1933, illiteracy among young people, adults, and the elderly had been eliminated. In the Russian Republic, the proportion of illiteracy elimination was 81.9 percent, and in the Ukrainian Republic, it was 85.3 percent. Our Chinese characters are not yet phonetic, so it is of course more difficult to learn, but our requirements are limited to young people, limited to 80 percent of young people, and only initially limited to 1,500 characters, so this plan can be realized.

    The above is a national plan. Due to different conditions in various places, the progress of the work of eliminating illiteracy should also be different. For example, Jin County, Liaoning Province, according to their report, only needs three years, and comrades in Beijing said that the suburbs of Beijing also only need three years. However, in some economically and culturally backward areas, such as some border provinces and remote mountainous areas, seven years may not be enough. Therefore, each province, county, and township should formulate a comprehensive plan for eliminating illiteracy based on its own situation, so as to actively and steadily complete this historical task of eliminating illiteracy.

    While carrying out the work of eliminating illiteracy, we must also advocate that full-time cadres across the country, teachers who eliminate illiteracy, intellectuals in rural areas, and the vast number of young people gradually learn and promote Mandarin Chinese. Because promoting Mandarin Chinese is not only the most important preparatory work for our country's reform of the writing system, but it can also accelerate the progress of the work of eliminating illiteracy.

      IV. Three Forms

    Eliminating illiteracy must also have practical and feasible specific methods. Based on years of experience, there are the following three forms for mobilizing and organizing the vast number of illiterate young people to learn culture.

    The first is the farmer's spare-time cultural school using class teaching. This is what we usually call the people's school. There are two forms of people's schools: one is the year-round people's school, and the other is the winter school. However, judging from the current situation, whether in terms of learning time or in terms of people's psychology, the winter school has become an outdated organizational form, causing many people to create the result of "winter school, winter school, no learning after winter," and "going to winter school every year, learning from scratch every year." Therefore, we do not advocate being limited to winter school anymore, but we want to learn in spring, summer, autumn, and winter. We should uniformly call them farmer's spare-time cultural schools, and establish a system of opening schools on time and taking the initiative to release schools, and adopt the teaching method of "learning more when not busy, learning less when slightly busy, and taking a break when very busy" according to the local agricultural busy situation.

    In recent years, the organization of work-point learning classes has also appeared in various places, which is also a form of class teaching. This type of learning class organizes the accountants and work-point recorders of the cooperative to learn the necessary writing and arithmetic for keeping accounts and recording work-points in a blitzkrieg manner. Facts have proved that the masses of the vast number of cooperatives, especially the masses of cooperatives lacking accountants and work-point recorders with a certain level of education, welcome this form. Various places should help farmers organize them in a planned way according to the needs of local cooperative development.

    The second is the literacy group using small group teaching. This is an auxiliary form of the farmer's spare-time cultural school, and it is particularly suitable for the situation of scattered rural residence and production. The grass-roots organizations of the League should appoint literate League members and mobilize literate young activists to serve as group leaders, so that each group has someone responsible for leading the learning.

    The third is the package teaching and learning using individual teaching. This is to mobilize all literate League members and call on all young people who are enthusiastic about eliminating illiteracy to help one or several illiterate young people learn to read and write, and be responsible for teaching them 1,500 characters. As mentioned above, there are now more than 30 million young people in rural areas who have shaken off illiteracy. In recent years, many of them have been very enthusiastic about the work of eliminating illiteracy, unconditionally dedicating the culture they have learned to their companions and friends, and some have even taken the trouble to actively help illiterate young people learn to read and write, called "bringing culture to their door." There are many moving examples in this regard.

    Facts tell us that as long as we fully use these organizational forms, we can form a huge literacy network and create a huge mass movement. There are still some comrades who are afraid of literacy, saying that there are too many things to take care of, but this is actually because they are not good at taking the mass line and relying on the power of the broad masses. Therefore, we must vigorously publicize and promote these effective organizational forms for eliminating illiteracy.

      V. Learn Three Books

    Eliminating illiteracy must also have a set of teaching methods that are easy for young people to accept and easy to learn. If we have this method, we can greatly encourage the learning confidence of illiterate young people and greatly shorten their learning time.

    According to the experience of the Communist Youth League branch of Gaojialiugou Village in Junan County, Shandong Province, in running a work-point learning class, we can adopt the teaching method of compiling three textbooks and taking three steps.

    The first step: Learn the names of people, places, tools, farm work, and some of the most necessary vocabulary in this village and township, about two or three hundred characters; at the same time, learn phonetic alphabets as much as possible to help recognize characters, record pronunciation, and look up dictionaries. This textbook should be compiled by comrades who guide agricultural collectivization in their own cooperatives. Each place should compile a book by itself, instead of using a unified textbook. It takes at most three or four months of spare time to learn this textbook.

    The second step: Compile a textbook according to the things and relatively common vocabulary in a smaller area, such as a county or a common special area, plus a part of the common things and common vocabulary nationwide, also only a few hundred characters. This textbook should also be compiled by comrades engaged in guiding cooperative work, and quickly reviewed by education departments at the county, special area, or provincial level. It takes at most three or four months of spare time to learn this textbook.

    The third step: The provincial education department compiles the third book. The content of this book can include the common things and common vocabulary in the province and the country. At the same time, it is also necessary to teach some arithmetic needed in rural areas and natural science knowledge about agriculture. It takes about seven or eight months of spare time to study this textbook and other necessary courses.

    The organizations of the Communist Youth League, especially the organizations of the Communist Youth League at the county, district, and township levels, should actively assist the cadres who guide cooperative work and the comrades of the education department to compile these three textbooks well, and find a more complete teaching experience, so that we can promptly promote the best experience to all parts of the country.

      VI. Implement Encouragement

    Since eliminating illiteracy is a matter that is of great benefit to socialist construction, we should give necessary encouragement to young people who study hard, activists who are enthusiastic about participating in eliminating illiteracy, and units that have achieved results in eliminating illiteracy.

    We should issue graduation certificates for eliminating illiteracy to young people who pass the examination with合格 grades. Issuing this kind of graduation certificate can not only count the results of eliminating illiteracy, but also enable these comrades to obtain the qualifications to enter rural spare-time higher primary schools. This kind of graduation certificate is uniformly formulated by the education department, and the Communist Youth League organization should assist the farmer's spare-time cultural school to issue it.

    We should issue medals to activists who are enthusiastic about participating in eliminating illiteracy. The Fourth Plenary Session of the Second Central Committee of the League has decided that the Central Committee of the League will formulate a reward regulation for the League in the work of eliminating illiteracy, which will be announced soon. We believe that the implementation of this kind of reward will greatly encourage the enthusiasm of rural educated youth to participate in the work of eliminating illiteracy.

    We should also give necessary encouragement to units that have eliminated illiteracy. That is to say, if the Communist Youth League organization of a certain township, district, or county assists the Party and the government in eliminating illiteracy among young people in accordance with the prescribed requirements, the Central Committee of the League, the Provincial Committee of the League, or the County Committee of the League will issue a certificate of commendation for eliminating illiteracy.

      VII. Books and Newspapers Go to the Countryside

    With the development of the work of eliminating illiteracy and the gradual increase of literate young people in rural areas, the need for popular books and newspapers in rural areas will become greater and greater. The current supply of books and periodicals in rural areas is unsatisfactory. All League organizations and all young cultural workers must work with cultural departments, literary and artistic groups, bookstores, and post offices to solve this problem.

    First, we must vigorously promote the creation of popular books. At present, our popular books are too few in number, too deep in degree, and too long in length. If our knowledge is limited to serving intellectuals and not serving the broadest masses of workers and peasants, it is very dangerous. Therefore, we must strive to organize and help the broad masses of writers and cultural and scientific workers to write more and better popular reading materials for the broadest masses of workers, peasants, and youth.

    Second, we must vigorously improve the distribution of popular books and newspapers. At present, many rural young people have money but cannot buy books or subscribe to newspapers and periodicals, which is mainly because there are not enough post offices in rural areas. Therefore, in places where there are no post offices, the grass-roots organizations of the Communist Youth League should select outstanding League members to establish rural voluntary post offices to help bookstores and post offices do a good job in distributing books and periodicals.

    Third, we must actively and systematically develop libraries and clubs in rural areas. With the continuous improvement of farmers' lives, especially the development of agricultural collectivization and the bumper harvest of farmers this year, many places have the conditions to run libraries and clubs, and the masses also have this requirement. As long as farmers are willing to do it, we should actively lead it. We should understand that if there are no libraries and clubs in rural areas, young people only know some characters but cannot see books and newspapers, and cannot sing or perform dramas, then the culture in rural areas is not complete. We should also understand that building more libraries and clubs in rural areas is building more strongholds for spreading socialist culture in rural areas.

    In addition, there are now a large number of junior and higher primary school graduates in cities who have not been promoted to higher schools. Many of them are full of enthusiasm and demand to participate in labor production, and the society is also very concerned about their future problems. However, some people think that participating in labor must be a worker or a cadre. This is of course a wrong idea. The number of new workers added to our country every year is very limited, and the number of cadres needed is even more limited; and the socialist transformation of agriculture has opened up infinitely broad roads for urban educated youth to participate in labor production. Therefore, the biggest way out for urban educated youth is to go to the countryside. We must constantly carry out propaganda and education for urban youth, mobilize them to consciously and voluntarily and happily go to the countryside to serve farmers, and work hard with the vast number of farmers to build a socialist new countryside.

      VIII. Timely Guidance

    Chairman Mao said in his report in July: "The central government, provincial party committees, district party committees, municipal party committees, and prefectural party committees must pay close attention to the inspection of the cooperative movement, not just once a year, but several times a year. If there is a problem, solve it immediately, don't let the problems pile up before making a total solution. Criticism should be timely criticism, don't always like post-mortem criticism." This instruction is also completely applicable to the work of eliminating illiteracy.

    The fundamental requirement for guiding the work of eliminating illiteracy is to adapt to people, adapt to time, and adapt to place, and strive to avoid the phenomenon of affecting production and causing compulsory orders due to eliminating illiteracy. In order not to affect production, we must master the teaching principle of "learning more when not busy, learning less when slightly busy, and taking a break when very busy" mentioned above. In order to avoid the phenomenon of compulsory orders, the League organization should carry out appropriate persuasion and mobilization for those who are willing to study but lack confidence, so that they can consciously and happily participate in learning. For those who cannot participate in learning temporarily due to physical disability, illness, pregnancy, or working outside, their learning time should be postponed and extended; and for those who still firmly refuse to study after persuasion and mobilization, they should be good at waiting under the current conditions and not force them. You should know that with the development of agricultural collectivization, the people around them can read and write, and these people will eventually ask to learn.

    In order to ensure the implementation of the teaching and enrollment principles mentioned above, the League committees at all levels must conduct frequent inspections. Starting from next year, the Youth League Committee and the education department can jointly hold two meetings a year at the county level, one is a meeting of cadres who eliminate illiteracy, and the other is a conference of activists who eliminate illiteracy. These two meetings can be used to summarize experiences, overcome shortcomings, commend models, and revise plans.

    The mass movement of the great socialist cultural revolution of eliminating illiteracy, which is accompanied by the agricultural collectivization movement, has been put on our work agenda. All comrades of the League must respond to the call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and in the movement of socialist transformation of agriculture, while learning to lead farmers to run cooperatives diligently and frugally, learn the ability to lead rural youth to achieve a cultural turnaround. As long as we are good at learning, we will certainly be able to fulfill this great historical task. We must work hard.

　　关于农村扫除文盲工作
　　胡耀邦
    这是我在一九五五年十月十六日团的二届四中全会上、十月二十八日上午北京各报记者会上、同日下午各地青联秘书长会议上讲话中关于农村扫除文盲问题的部分，现在把它合并整理出来，作为各地进行扫除文盲工作的参考。——作者
      一、战略任务
    党的七届六中全会在讨论到农业合作化的全面规划的时候，曾经指出务必把扫除文盲的工作规划进去。这是实行对农业的社会主义改造的有战略意义的任务之一。
    为什么说这是一个战略任务？
    我国农村现在还存在着大量的文盲，单是一亿青年中，就有七千万左右是文盲和半文盲。这种现象的存在，严重地妨碍着农民的进步，给农业合作化的发展造成了很大的困难。例如现在有些地方的合作社，由于农民没有文化，又缺乏具有一定文化知识的会计，账目很不清楚，农民把这种账叫做“良心账”，就有力地证明了这一点。随着农业合作化的发展，随着广大农民群众生活水平的提高，广大农民，特别是青年农民迫切地要求学习文化。因此中央指出，这个严重的问题必须在农业合作化的过程中加以解决，也只有在农业合作化的过程中才能解决。如果我们认真地解决了这个问题，就有助于推进农业合作化胜利地向前发展。
    问题不仅如此。我国从第三个五年计划起，就要在农村中大规模地使用机器耕作。到一九六七年，预计机器耕作的面积将占全部耕地总面积的百分之四十七左右。农村的电气化也将逐步发展。因此我们这一代农村青年必须具有更高的文化水平，以便在不久的将来能够熟练地驾起各式各样的“铁牛”，把农村的面貌根本改变过来。
      二、天然助手
    青年团在扫除文盲这个严重任务中，是党和政府的“天然助手”。
    这是斯大林的一句话。斯大林这句话说得非常中肯。因为，学习文化首先是青年的迫切要求，而我们的党和国家也正是把掌握文化这个任务，着重地放在青年的身上。
    既然青年团是党和政府扫除文盲工作的天然助手，我们就应当严肃负责，把这个工作主动地积极地担当起来。全团的同志要懂得，如果青年团不认真地解决广大青年群众所迫切需要解决的问题，就会脱离群众；如果青年团这样一个革命团体脱离群众，就是不能积极地为社会主义奋斗，就没有存在的价值。
    几年来，很多团的组织在扫除文盲和组织青年学习的工作中，做了许多事情，这是很好的；但是也有不少团的组织对青年的学习不大关心，没有做什么工作，这是很不好的。
    建设社会主义是一场严重的斗争，不能马马虎虎。扫除文盲的工作也是一场严重的斗争，也不能马马虎虎。做得好的，就应当表扬；做得不好的，就应当批评。批评和自我批评在社会主义建设和社会主义改造的过程中，特别重要。青年团的同志在扫除文盲工作中，也像在其他一切工作中一样，要学会掌握批评和自我批评的武器。对于那些消极的有害的东西，要大胆地勇敢地提出建议和批评；在工作中如果有缺点有错误，就应当勇敢地承认并且加以消除和纠正。
    三、全面规划
    “要有全面的规划”，这是毛主席在本年七月的报告中提出的一个著名口号。有了全面的规划，我们就能够主动地、有预见地、有系统地进行领导，就可以周密而稳妥地去取得胜利。
    扫除文盲工作也要有全国的、全省的、全县的、全乡的全面规划。
    经过几个月的调查和研究，我们认为在青年中扫除文盲，就全国范围来说，可以初步拟定如下的轮廓：用七年的时间，即从今年起到一九六二年为止，使全国青年文盲的百分之八十左右脱离文盲状态，并且使他们每人都认识一千五百个字左右。
    把青年中扫除文盲的最低标准定为一千五百个字左右，是因为只有这样，才能看懂通俗的书籍报刊；只有能看懂通俗的书籍报刊，才能进行自学，才能巩固扫除文盲的成果，才能同以后升入业余高小衔接起来。而一般的青年人对一千五百个字能读、能写、能用，大概有一年半的业余时间就够了。
    把青年中扫除文盲的比例定为百分之八十左右，是因为扫除文盲工作暂时还只能按照自愿的原则，而在青年中，可能有些人由于身体残废、或者长期害病、或者其它各种原因而不能学习，或者不能坚持到底地学习，也可能有极少数人不愿意学习，而暂时又还不能让他进初级学校去受义务教育。如果我们把比例定为百分之百，而实际上还没有必要的条件来保证，那就要犯主观主义和形式主义的错误。
    如果按照以上的标准，把扫除青年文盲的工作定在一九六二年完成是完全可能的。这是因为，如上面所已经说过的，（一）广大青年的社会主义觉悟大大提高，有不做“睁眼瞎子”的热烈愿望；（二）农村中现在已经有三千多万完全摆脱了文盲状态的青年，他们是我们能够大规模地胜利地开展扫除文盲工作的一支可以依靠的强大力量；（三）使一个青年文盲认识一千五百个字，一般地有一年半的时间就可以，这样，七年就可以翻四翻。苏联也是在农业合作化运动中扫除文盲的，到一九三三年就把青年、壮年和老年中的文盲扫除了，在俄罗斯共和国，扫除文盲的比例是百分之八十一点九，乌克兰共和国是百分之八十五点三。我们的汉字现在还不是拼音文字，学起来当然要难些，但是我们的要求只限于青年，只限于青年的百分之八十，并且初步地只限于一千五百字，所以这个计划是可以实现的。
    以上是全国范围的规划。由于各地的条件不同，扫除文盲工作的进度也应当不同。例如辽宁省金县，按照他们的报告说只要三年的时间就够了，北京市的同志说北京郊区也只要三年的时间。但是在有些经济和文化比较落后的地区，例如一些边疆省份和偏僻的山区，七年的时间可能就不够。因此，各省、各县、各乡都应当根据自己的情况，作出扫除文盲工作的全面规划，以便积极地、稳妥地完成扫除文盲这个历史任务。
    在进行扫除文盲工作的同时，我们还要提倡全国专职干部、扫除文盲的教员、农村中的知识分子以及广大青年逐步地学习和推广普通话。因为推广普通话不仅是我国进行文字改革的一项最重要的准备工作，而且也可以加速扫除文盲工作的进展。
      四、三种形式
    扫除文盲还必须有切实可行的具体办法。根据多年来的经验，动员和组织广大文盲青年学习文化，有下面三种形式。
    第一种是采用班级教学的农民业余文化学校。这就是我们平常所讲的民校。民校有两种形式：一种是常年民校，一种是冬学。但是根据现在的情况看来，无论在学习的时间上，或者在人们的心理上，冬学已经是一种落后的组织形式，使许多人造成了“冬学冬学，冬去不学”、“年年上冬学，年年从头学”的结果。因此，我们不主张再限于冬学，而是要春夏秋冬都学。我们应当把它们统一称为农民业余文化学校，并且建立按期开学、主动放学的制度，根据本地农忙情况采取“不忙多学，小忙少学，大忙放学”的教学办法。
    近几年来，各地还出现了记工学习班的组织，也是采用班级教学的一种形式。这种学习班是把合作社的会计和记工员组织起来，采用带有突击性的办法学会记账、记工所必需的文字和算术。事实证明，广大合作社的群众，特别是缺乏有一定文化程度的会计和记工员的合作社的群众很欢迎这种形式。各地应当根据本地合作化发展的需要，有计划地帮助农民举办。
    第二种是采用小组教学的识字小组。这是农民业余文化学校的一种辅助形式，它特别适合农村居住和生产分散的情况。团的基层组织应当指派识字的团员和动员识字的青年积极分子去担任组长，以便使每个小组都有人负责领导学习。
    第三种是采用个别教学的包教包学。这就是动员一切识字的团员和号召一切热心扫盲的青年，每人帮助一个或几个文盲青年识字，并且负责到把他们教会一千五百个字为止。上面说过，现在农村已经有三千多万摆脱了文盲状态的青年，几年来他们中间的许多人对扫除文盲工作十分热心，把自己学到的文化无条件地献给自己的同伴和朋友，有的还不辞劳苦地主动去帮文盲青年识字，叫做“把文化送上门去”。这方面动人的事例非常之多。
    事实告诉我们，只要我们把这些组织形式充分地运用起来，就可以形成一个规模巨大的扫盲网，就可以造成一个巨大的群众运动。现在还有些同志害怕扫盲，说事情太多，顾不过来，其实是由于不善于走群众路线，依靠广大群众力量办事的缘故。因此，我们必须大力宣传和推广这些行之有效的扫除文盲的组织形式。
      五、学三本书
    扫除文盲还要有一套为青年容易接受容易学会的教学方法。如果有了这种方法，就可以大大地鼓舞文盲青年的学习信心，大大地缩短他们的学习时间。
    根据山东莒南县高家柳沟村青年团支部创办记工学习班的经验，我们可以采用编三本课本、分三步走的教学方法。
    第一步：学习本村本乡的人名、地名、工具名、农活名和一些最必要的语汇，大约两三百字；同时尽可能地学习拼音字母，以便帮助认字，记音，查字典。这种课本，要由指导农业合作化工作的同志各就自己的合作社去编。每处自编一本，而不必用统一的课本。学完这本课本，至多有三四个月的业余时间就够了。
    第二步：按照一个较小范围的地方，例如一个县或者一个常见的专区的事物和比较通用的语汇，加上一部分全国性的常见的事物和通用的语汇，编一本课本，也只要几百字。这本课本也应当由从事指导合作化工作的同志去编，由县级、专区级或者省级的教育机关迅速地加以审查。学完这本课本，至多也只要三四个月的业余时间。
    第三步：由省级教育机关编出第三本书。这本书的内容可以包括本省和全国常见的事物和通用的语汇。同时还要讲授一些农村需要的算术和农业方面的自然科学知识。学习这本课本和其他的必要课程，大约需要七八个月的业余时间。
    青年团的组织，特别是县、区、乡三级青年团的组织，应当积极地协同指导合作化工作的干部和教育部门的同志编好这三本课本，并且找出一套更完整的教学经验来，以便我们能够将最好的经验及时地向全国各地推广。
      六、实行鼓励
    扫除文盲既然是一个对社会主义建设大有好处的事情，我们就应当对努力学习的青年，对热心参加扫除文盲的积极分子和对扫除文盲有成绩的单位实行必要的鼓励。
    我们对经过考试成绩及格的青年，应当发给他们扫除文盲的毕业证书。颁发这种毕业证书，既可以统计扫除文盲的成果，又可以使这些同志取得升入农村业余高小的资格。这种毕业证书由教育部门统一制定，青年团组织应当协助农民业余文化学校颁发。
    我们对热心参加扫除文盲的积极分子，应当发给他们奖章。团的二届四中全会已经决定由团中央制定一个团在扫除文盲工作中的奖励条例，这个条例不久即可公布。我们相信实行这种奖励，将会大大地鼓舞农村知识青年参加扫除文盲工作的积极性。
    我们还应当对扫除了文盲的单位，给以必要的鼓励。这就是说，凡某个乡、某个区、某个县团的组织协助党和政府已经按照规定的要求扫除了青年文盲，即由团中央或团省委或团县委发给扫除文盲的奖状。
      七、书报下乡
    随着扫除文盲工作的开展，随着农村识字青年的逐年增加，农村对于通俗书报的需要会越来越大。现在农村中的书籍报刊的供应情况是不能令人满意的。一切团的组织和一切青年文化工作者必须协同文化部门、文艺团体、书店、邮局努力解决这个问题。
    第一，必须大力繁荣通俗书籍的创作。现在我们的通俗书籍是数量太少、程度太深、篇幅太长。我们的知识如果只限于为知识分子服务，而不为最广大的工农群众服务，那是非常危险的。因此，我们必须努力组织和帮助广大的作家和文化、科学工作者为最广大的工农青年写出更多更好的通俗读物来。
    第二，必须大力改进通俗书籍和报纸的发行工作。现在许多农村青年有钱买不到书、订不到报刊，这主要是农村里的邮站不够普遍。因此在没有邮站的地方，青年团的基层组织应当挑选优秀的团员建立起农村义务邮站，帮助书店和邮局做好书籍报刊的发行工作。
    第三，必须积极地有计划地发展农村中的图书室和俱乐部。随着农民生活的不断上升，特别是农业合作化的发展和今年农民丰收，许多地方都有条件兴办图书室和俱乐部，群众也有这个要求。只要农民愿意办，我们就应当积极去领导。我们应当懂得，如果农村没有图书室和俱乐部，青年们只识一些字而看不到书报，也不会唱歌、演戏，那末农村的文化还是不完全的。我们还应当懂得，在农村中多办一个图书室和俱乐部，就是在农村中多建立了一个传播社会主义文化的据点。
    此外，现在城市中有大批没有升学的初中和高小毕业生，他们中的许多人满腔热忱地要求参加劳动生产，社会上也很关心他们的出路问题。但是有些人以为参加劳动就一定要当工人或者是当干部。这当然是错误的想法。我们的国家每年增加新工人的数量是很有限的，需要干部的数量更为有限；而农业的社会主义改造则为城市知识青年参加劳动生产开辟了无限广阔的道路。因此城市知识青年最大的出路就是到农村中去。我们必须经常地对城市青年进行宣传教育，动员他们自觉自愿地、兴高采烈地到农村去为农民服务，同广大农民一道，为建设社会主义的新农村而努力奋斗。
      八、及时指导
    毛主席在七月间的报告中说：“对于合作化运动的检查工作，中央、各省委、区党委、市委和地委必须十分抓紧，每年不是进行一次，而是应当进行几次。一有问题就去解决，不要使问题成了堆才去作一次总解决。批评要是及时的批评，不要老是爱好事后的批评。”这个指示对于扫除文盲的工作也是完全适用的。
    对于扫除文盲工作的指导的根本要求，就是要因人制宜，因时制宜，因地制宜，力求避免因为扫除文盲而影响生产和发生强迫命令的现象。为了不影响生产，就必须掌握上面讲过的“不忙多学，小忙少学，大忙放学”的教学原则。为了不发生强迫命令现象，对于那些愿意学习但是缺乏信心的人，团的组织应当进行适当的说服动员，使他们能够自觉地、高兴地参加学习。对于那些因身体残废、患病、怀孕或外出做工而暂时不能参加学习的人，应当推迟和延长他们的学习时间；而对于那些经过劝说动员还是坚决不愿意学习的人，在目前的条件下也要善于等待，不要强迫他们。要知道，随着农业合作化的发展，他们周围的人们又都能够读书识字了，这些人终究是会要求学习的。
    为了确实保证贯彻上面所讲的教学和入学的原则，各级团委必须勤加检查。从明年起，可以以县为单位，每年由青年团委和教育部门联合召开两次会，一次是扫除文盲干部会议，一次是扫除文盲积极分子大会，用这两种会来总结经验、克服缺点、表扬模范和修订计划。
    伴随着农业合作化运动而来的扫除文盲这个伟大的社会主义文化革命的群众运动，已经提到我们的工作日程上来了。全团同志必须响应党中央和毛主席的号召，在农业的社会主义改造运动中，在学会领导农民勤俭办社的同时，学会领导农村青年实现文化大翻身的本领。只要我们善于学习，就一定能够完满地实现这个伟大的历史任务。我们必须努力。
