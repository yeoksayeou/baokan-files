　　On the evening of the 10th, a convoy of cars from Shua Jing Temple, crossing over the snow-capped mountains, arrived in Aba, the center of the grassland on the Sichuan, Gansu, and Qinghai border, which is also the terminal of the Chengdu-Aba highway. The day that the people of the grassland had long awaited had finally arrived. More than eight thousand people gathered two *li* away from Aba urban area to welcome the arrival of the cars. Among them were herdsmen from the banks of the Yellow River, more than two hundred *li* away, and lamas who had come from dozens of *li* away. The white-haired Tibetan old woman Geng Cuo also came to see the cars with a crutch, and the eighty-five-year-old Hui old woman Mi Wenzhen, whose eyes were already dim, also asked her family to carry her to participate in this grand event. In the two days before the opening of the road, several thousand people had been newly added to the Aba urban area, and more than one hundred new tents had been added to the suburbs.
　　When the long convoy of cars, led by a float with a portrait of Chairman Mao, passed by, the crowd cheered wildly. Hua Er Gongcheng Lie, Vice Chairman of the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Sichuan Province, presented a *hada* to the float, lamas played music on long trumpets, and many people took off their hats and shouted "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao" to the cars. The people of all nationalities in the grassland understood that it was the Communist Party and Chairman Mao who had brought them national equality and a happy life. Ya Ge, a Tibetan from Longzang Gou, brought his whole family, including a child who was just over one year old, to welcome the cars. He walked up to the float and said to the people: "We are separated from the mainland by many mountains and many rivers. Today, with the highway, our connection with the motherland is closer, and our lives will be happier." To celebrate this major festival, on the 11th, more than six thousand Tibetan, Hui, and Han people held a grand celebration meeting in Aba's Chongna (market). After the meeting, a scene of joyful singing and dancing appeared in Chongna. More than twenty Tibetan youths performed horse racing, Hui youths performed costume dances, and Tibetan men and women happily danced the *Guozhuang*.

　　阿埧各族人民欢庆成阿公路全线通车
    十日傍晚，从刷经寺开出的汽车行列，翻越过雪山，开到了成阿公路终点——川、甘、青边境草地中心的阿埧。草地人民久久渴望的一天来到了。八千多人聚集在远离阿埧城区两里路的地方，迎候着汽车的到来。里面有从两百多里外的黄河边上来的牧民，有从几十里外赶来的喇嘛。白发苍苍的藏族老太婆更措也拄着拐杖来看汽车，八十五岁的回族老太婆米文珍，两眼已经昏花，也叫家里人背来参加这个盛会。还在通车的前两天，阿埧城区一带就新增加了数千人，郊野里新添了一百多个帐篷。
    当以挂着毛主席像的彩车为前导的长长的汽车行列通过时，人群狂烈地欢腾起来。四川省藏族自治区副主席华尔功成烈给彩车挂上了哈达，喇嘛们用长管喇叭吹奏着音乐，许多人脱下帽子向汽车高喊着“毛主席，毛主席”。草地各族人民懂得，是共产党和毛主席给他们带来的民族平等和幸福的生活。从龙藏沟来的藏民雅戈把全家人连一岁多的小孩都带来迎接汽车。他走到彩车跟前向人们说：“我们和内地隔着许多山，许多河，今天有了公路，我们同祖国内地联系更密切了，我们的生活也会更幸福了。”为了庆祝这个重大的节日，十一日，六千多藏、回、汉人民在阿埧的崇纳（市场）上举行了隆重的庆祝会，会后，崇纳里又出现一片欢乐歌舞，二十多个藏族青年表演了跑马，回族青年表演了化装舞蹈，藏族男女们欢乐地跳着锅庄。
