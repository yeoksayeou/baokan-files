　　More Than a Thousand Tons of Scrap Steel
　　In the yard of the Tianjin Public-Private Joint Venture Xinxing Steel Plant, piles of rusty steel ingots, scrap steel sheets, and scrap castings are stacked high. This "scrap mountain" seemed to be rising rapidly like a "competition" indicator, one hundred tons, five hundred tons, one thousand tons...
　　When the Xinxing Steel Plant was trial-producing the new alkaline steel product this year, the plant leaders were muddled by complacency. They thought that since they could master the technology of smelting acid steel, alkaline steel would be about the same, so they did not seriously prepare for the production of the new product. As a result, a large number of the cast steel ingots had defects such as slag inclusions and short ends. From July to October, the number of substandard and waste steel products alone reached more than 1,370 tons.
　　Before this, the Xinxing Steel Plant had failed to complete the national product quality plan for ten consecutive months. Because the inferior steel ingots produced were returned after being sent out. The workers, seeing the low-quality products produced in the plant and the "scrap mountain" that changed every day, said angrily: Socialist construction needs a lot of steel, but our plant is wasting a lot of steel. How can we be worthy of the country!

　  一千多吨废钢
    天津公私合营新兴钢厂的场地上，堆满满身黄锈的钢锭、废钢片、废铸件。这个“废品山”眼看像“竞赛”的指标一样，一百吨、五百吨、一千吨……飞快地上升起来。
    新兴钢厂今年试制新产品碱性钢的时候，厂的领导人被自满情绪弄得迷迷糊糊的，他们认为炼酸性钢的技术都能掌握了，碱性钢还是差不多，便没有认真做好新产品的生产准备工作。结果浇铸出来的钢锭大批出现夹渣、短头等次品。从七月到十月光次品、废品钢就达一千三百七十多吨。
    在这以前，新兴钢厂一连十个月都没完成国家产品质量计划。因为生产的劣质钢锭送出去了又被退回来。工人们看见厂内生产的质量低劣的产品和天天都有变化的“废品山”，气愤地说：社会主义建设需要大量钢铁，可是我们厂却在大量浪费钢铁，这怎样对得起国家啊！
