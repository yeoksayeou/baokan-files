    Support the Japanese People's Struggle Against U.S. Military Bases

    The struggle against U.S. military bases and the U.S. military occupation system has become a large-scale, national movement in Japan. Currently, this movement is continuing to develop in depth. Recently, the Japan Socialist Party's Military Base Committee, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), and the National Liaison Council Against Military Bases in Japan have all held meetings successively, deciding to strengthen the movement against U.S. military bases nationwide. On November 22nd, the National Liaison Council Against Military Bases in Japan held its Third National Congress. The congress decided to expand the current struggles against military bases by people in various parts of Japan to all prefectures, organize prefectural-level anti-base movements in each prefecture, and called on the people of the whole country to widely launch effective activities such as petitions, signatures, fundraising, and lectures to promote this movement. This united struggle action of the Japanese people fully reflects their urgent desire to defend their independence and sovereignty and to get rid of foreign control.

    The long-term stationing of U.S. troops in Japan and the establishment of U.S. military bases in Japan are very obvious damages to Japan's sovereignty and independence. U.S. troops are stationed in Japan under the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and the "Administrative Agreement." The "Security Treaty" stipulates that the United States can not only indefinitely carry out military occupation of Japan under the false pretext of "maintaining peace and security," but also use U.S. armed forces to "suppress large-scale riots and disturbances in Japan"; the "Administrative Agreement" guarantees the United States the right to build military bases on Japanese territory and allows U.S. troops to enjoy extraterritoriality. The implementation of these unequal treaties, which infringe upon Japan's sovereignty and independence, has not only caused millions of Japanese farmers to lose their land, deprived the vast number of fishermen of their right to fish, and caused U.S. military bases to spread throughout Japan, but also made U.S. troops immune from Japanese judicial jurisdiction, allowing them to commit crimes at will and insult the national feelings and national dignity of the Japanese people. The French "International Forum" said on October 7th:

  “Despite the peace treaty with Japan, Japan continues to be occupied, and the Japanese are not completely independent.”

    The Japanese people have realized from their own experiences that as long as U.S. troops continue to stay in Japan and as long as U.S. military bases are still located on Japanese territory, they cannot obtain true national independence and are also in danger of being dragged into a new war. Therefore, the Japanese people have always regarded opposing U.S. military bases and opposing the continued stationing of U.S. troops in Japan as one of their central tasks in striving for national independence and safeguarding national sovereignty. For ten years, the Japanese people have waged a firm and unyielding struggle for this. U.S. military base workers in Japan have waged large-scale strikes to oppose the oppression of the U.S. military authorities. Residents of Uchinada Village in Ishikawa Prefecture sat in protest in the field for as long as one hundred days to oppose the establishment of a shooting range by the U.S. military. The struggle of the residents in the Mt. Myogi area of Gunma Prefecture lasted for more than two years and finally achieved victory. Residents in the Mt. Asama area and near Mt. Fuji have all waged long-term struggles to defend their land. These events, which caused a sensation throughout Japan, fully demonstrated the determination of the Japanese people to safeguard their independence and sovereignty and their spirit of heroic struggle.

    Now, the Japanese people's movement against the expansion of U.S. military bases has even greater significance in opposing atomic war and opposing the U.S. storing atomic weapons in Japan, turning Japan into a U.S. atomic war base. Since the beginning of this year, the United States has been trying its best to expand the military base network centered on Mt. Fuji, in order to establish the center of the radar network here and enable the airport to accommodate giant jet aircraft loaded with atomic bombs to take off and land. The United States has also transported atomic cannons into Japan. This seriously threatens the safety of the lives and property of the Japanese people. Therefore, the characteristic of the Japanese people's current struggle against U.S. military bases is to fully support the residents of Sunagawa Town in Tokyo in opposing the expansion of the Tachikawa base and opposing the U.S. military's testing of atomic cannons at the Mt. Fuji base and the Hokkaido base. The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) also decided at its meeting on November 12th to focus the current struggle against military bases on opposing the expansion of six U.S. air force bases, including Tachikawa, Yokota, Kisarazu, Komaki, Niigata, and Itazuke, in order to prevent the United States from turning these air force bases into atomic war bases. The struggle of the residents of Sunagawa Town against the expansion of the Tachikawa base has now received the support of people from all walks of life throughout Japan. Not only local residents and workers and farmers from various places participated in preventing the Japanese government authorities from surveying the land, but also members of the Japanese Diet. This struggle has developed into a nationwide struggle.

    It can be seen from this that the struggle against U.S. military bases currently being waged by the Japanese people is not only to defend Japan's sovereignty and independence and safeguard the vital interests of the Japanese people themselves, but also to safeguard peace and security in Asia. The Japanese people's struggle against U.S. military bases has become part of the struggle for peace by the people of Asia and the world.

    In the struggle to safeguard national independence and sovereignty, oppose U.S. military bases, and oppose the long-term stationing of U.S. troops in Japan, the Japanese people are increasingly realizing that only by uniting all patriotic forces and organizing a broad united front can Japan be spared from being driven to war, and can it be possible to create an independent, democratic, and peaceful life. The Chinese people express deep sympathy for the current situation of the Japanese people; they express warm support for the just struggle of the Japanese people. We believe that the Japanese people, with their lofty national self-esteem, will surely get rid of the enslavement of foreign forces and open up a free and bright road for the future of Japan.

### 支持日本人民反对美国军事基地的斗争

    支持日本人民反对美国军事基地的斗争
    反对美国军事基地和美国军事占领制度的斗争，已经成为日本全民性质的大规模运动。目前这个运动正在继续深入地向前发展。最近，日本社会党军事基地委员会、日本工会总评议会和日本全国反对军事基地联络会议都曾先后召开会议，决定要在全国范围内加强反对美国军事基地的运动。十一月二十二日，日本全国反对军事基地联络会议举行了第三次全国代表大会。大会决定把目前日本各地人民反对军事基地的斗争扩大到各个县，在各个县组织全县规模的反对基地运动，并号召全国人民广泛展开请愿、签名、募捐和举行讲演会等有效活动来推进这个运动。日本人民这种团结一致的斗争行动，充分地反映出他们保卫独立主权和摆脱外国控制的迫切愿望。
    美国军队长期留驻日本和在日本建立军事基地，对于日本主权和独立的损害是非常明显的。美国军队是根据美日“安全条约”和“行政协定”驻在日本的。“安全条约”规定，美国不仅可以在“维持和平和安全”的虚伪借口下无限期地对日本实行军事占领，而且可以用美国武装来“镇压日本国内的大规模的暴动和骚乱”；“行政协定”则保证美国有权在日本领土上修筑军事基地，使美国军队享有治外法权。这些侵犯日本主权和独立的不平等条约实施的结果，不但使千千万万日本农民丧失土地，使广大渔民被剥夺了捕鱼的权利，使美国的军事基地遍布日本全国，而且美国军队不受日本司法的管辖，可以任意犯法，侮辱日本人民的民族感情和民族尊严。法国“国际论坛”在十月七日就说：
  “尽管有对日和约，日本仍然继续被占领着，日本人没有完全独立。”
    日本人民已经从切身的体验中认识到，只要美国军队还继续留在日本，只要日本领土上还设有美国军事基地，他们就不能得到真正的民族独立，并且还有被卷入新战争的危险。因此，日本人民一直把反对美国军事基地和反对美国军队继续留驻日本，作为他们争取民族独立和维护国家主权的中心任务之一。十年来，日本人民为此进行了坚强不屈的斗争。美国军事基地日本工人为反对美国军事当局的压迫，曾经进行了大规模的罢工斗争。石川县内滩村的居民为反对美军建立打靶场，曾在野外静坐示威达一百天之久。群马县妙义山地区居民的斗争，坚持了两年多，终于取得胜利。浅间山地区和富士山附近的居民，都曾为了保卫自己的土地进行了长期的斗争。这些轰动日本全国的事件，充分表现了日本人民维护独立主权的决心和英勇斗争的精神。
    现在，日本人民反对美国扩大军事基地的运动，更具有反对原子战争和反对美国在日本储存原子武器把日本变成美国原子战争基地的重大意义。今年以来，美国竭力想要扩大以富士山为中心的军事基地网，就是要在这里建立雷达网的中心，并使机场能供装载原子弹的巨型喷气飞机起落。美国并且已经把原子大炮运进日本。这就严重地威胁着日本人民生命财产的安全。因此，日本人民目前反对美国军事基地斗争的特点，是全力支持东京砂川町居民反对扩大立川基地，反对美国军队在富士山基地和北海道基地试验原子大炮。日本工会总评议会在十一月十二日的会议上也决定，要把目前反对军事基地的斗争重点放在反对扩大立川、横田、木更津、小牧、新泻和板付等六个美国空军基地，就是要阻止美国把这些空军基地变成原子战争基地。砂川町居民反对扩大立川基地的斗争，现在已经得到日本全国各阶层人民的支持。在阻止日本政府当局测量土地时，不仅有当地居民和各地工人农民参加，而且有日本国会的议员参加。这个斗争已经发展成为全国性的斗争。
    由此可以看出，现在日本人民所进行的反对美国军事基地的斗争，不仅是为了保卫日本的主权和独立、维护日本人民自己的切身利益，而且也是为了维护亚洲的和平和安全。日本人民反对美国军事基地的斗争，已经成为亚洲和全世界人民争取和平斗争的一部分。
    日本人民在维护国家独立主权、反对美国军事基地和反对美国军队长期留驻日本的斗争中，越来越认识到只有团结一切爱国力量，组织成广泛的统一战线，才能使日本免于被驱向战争，才有可能缔造独立、民主、和平的生活。中国人民对于日本人民今天的处境，表示深切的同情；对于日本人民的正义斗争，表示热烈的支持。我们相信，有着崇高的民族自尊心的日本人民，一定会摆脱外国势力的奴役，为日本的未来开辟出自由和光明的道路。
