　　Studying Engels' Great Philosophical Works
　　Li Zhiming
　　The cause of scientific communism is forever inseparable from the names of its founders, Marx and Engels. Since Marx and Engels jointly solemnly announced the historical mission of the proletariat to the world for the first time more than a century ago (1848), every trace of the advancement of human history has gloriously confirmed the unparalleled correctness of all of Marx and Engels' doctrines. The reason why Marx and Engels' doctrines are universally applicable is that they are the truth, and that they take a scientific worldview as the theoretical basis of all their doctrines, which is dialectical materialism.
　　We know that Marx and Engels jointly created dialectical materialism, but in his lifelong revolutionary work, Marx devoted most of his efforts to a comprehensive analysis of capitalist society. Therefore, the task of criticizing idealist philosophy and expounding dialectical materialism inevitably fell more on Engels' shoulders. In this regard, Engels left us an extremely valuable and rich legacy, and his great works shine with indelible ideological brilliance.
　　Engels' "Anti-Dühring" is one of the most outstanding combat documents in Marxist literature. It is the first work to provide a complete narrative of the three components of Marxism—Marxist philosophy, political economy, and scientific socialism. The significance of Engels' work actually far exceeded the task of criticizing Dühring's views at that time.
　　In "Anti-Dühring," what is of more direct significance to our study of Marxist philosophy is the "Preface" and the first part—"Philosophy." Here, Engels systematically discussed the basic principles of dialectical materialism. In the "Preface" and the last two sections of the "Philosophy" part, Engels examined the history of the struggle between dialectics and metaphysics, pointing out that the existing achievements of various sciences have completely negated the metaphysical method. Engels pointed out that metaphysics is a product of a certain stage in the development of human understanding. It has its inevitability, but it will also be abandoned by history itself, giving way to a more advanced scientific methodology, namely, materialist dialectics. At the same time, Engels also profoundly confirmed the objective universality of dialectical laws with the research results of various sciences. Nature itself is the touchstone of dialectics. Engels gave a classic scientific definition of dialectics: dialectics is the science of the general laws of motion and development of nature, human society, and thought. Engels opposed Dühring's slander of Marxist dialectics, distinguished the boundary between Marxist dialectics and Hegel's dialectics, and discussed the three basic laws of dialectics: the law of contradiction, the law of the transformation of quantity into quality, and the law of the negation of the negation. It must be pointed out that when Engels discussed the objective and universal law of the negation of the negation, he regarded negation as a positive factor in the context of development and connection, a critique and inheritance of the old by the new. Therefore, the negation of the negation is the realization of a higher stage of development, not a simple cycle. Stalin inherited Engels' idea and pointed out in "Dialectical and Historical Materialism": development is a forward, ascending movement, a movement from the lower to the higher, from the simple to the complex. Therefore, we cannot ignore the important significance of this law, let alone rudely regard it as an outdated thing. For example, the establishment of public ownership in socialist society is the negation of the negation of private ownership in human history, but it is not a simple repetition of the public ownership of primitive society, but represents a more advanced social development of mankind. This shows that the negation of the negation is an objective law. It was precisely here that Dühring did not understand, and insisted on saying that Marx regarded Hegel's dialectics as a "tool of proof." Engels cited examples from various sciences to illustrate the objective universality of the negation of the negation, and pointed out Dühring's ignorance. Here, Engels also taught us how to treat Marxist dialectics. Engels instructed us that we must never regard Marxist dialectics as a "tool of proof," but should regard dialectics as a scientific method for studying and understanding things. This is very worthy of our attention. Some people do not understand this point, and rigidly apply dialectics as a rigid diagram everywhere. This is not the attitude of us Marxists towards dialectics.
　　In the "Philosophy" part, Engels also systematically discussed the theory of materialist philosophy of Marxism, such as the principle that the unity of the world lies in its materiality, the principle that motion is the form of the existence of matter, the principle of the objective infinity of time and space, and the materialist solution to truth, freedom, and necessity, etc., which are all worthy of our attention and serious study.
　　Engels' "Dialectics of Nature" is an unfinished manuscript. In this work, Engels originally planned to discuss the dialectics of nature. From this manuscript, it is not difficult for us to see Engels' emphasis on natural science. Engels' work is a must-read for us, especially for natural scientists who urgently demand to master Marxist philosophy.
　　The "Introduction" part of this book is Engels' completed draft, which has very important significance. Here, Engels comprehensively examined the history of the emergence and development of modern natural science. He pointed out that natural science has been revolutionary since its inception. In the process of development, natural science has gone through two major struggles: first, it freed itself from the shackles of religion, and then it broke through the net of metaphysics, so that it became more and more combined with materialist dialectics. The course experienced by natural science is the process of the formation of a scientific worldview; the scientific worldview—dialectical materialism—is regularly produced on the basis of these achievements achieved by natural science. In other words, the development of modern natural science inevitably leads to the conclusion of a new scientific worldview, and once the new scientific worldview is produced, it in turn greatly promotes the rapid development of various sciences. This is the law of development of human cognitive history that Engels revealed to us.
　　In "Dialectics of Nature," Engels repeatedly discussed the relationship between philosophy and science. Engels criticized some natural scientists' views of despising philosophy. Engels pointed out that natural scientists cannot move forward without theoretical thinking. Those who think that philosophy is not needed often unconsciously accept the influence of the worst philosophy. Therefore, the question is not to completely break the relationship between natural science and philosophy, but to determine which philosophy natural science accepts as the guidance of its research. Engels summarized the history of the development of science and philosophy, and pointed out a correct path for natural scientists: dialectics is the most important form of thinking for today's natural scientists. Although Lenin did not have the opportunity to read Engels' work during his lifetime, Lenin made the same conclusion from the struggle of modern natural science against idealism, emphasizing that if today's natural scientists do not consciously master dialectical materialism, they will not be able to resist the invasion of idealism, nor will they be able to get rid of the crisis of natural science, and therefore there will be no further development.
　　In addition, Engels also examined the relationship between objective dialectics and subjective dialectics, the diversity of forms of material movement and the dialectical laws of their mutual transformation, and the various categories of dialectics—the law of causality, necessity and chance, etc. In the latter part of the book, Engels liquidated idealism, agnosticism, and metaphysics in various sciences, which paved the way for the guiding role of dialectical materialism in various scientific fields. Engels' "Dialectics of Nature" is a brilliant example of cleverly using Marxist dialectics to analyze problems in natural science. We should learn from Engels' book how to apply dialectics to natural science and fight against idealist and metaphysical views in natural science.
　　"Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical German Philosophy" is an outstanding work by Engels that opposes the bourgeois worldview with the proletarian worldview. In this excellent work, Engels not only made relentless exposures and criticisms of various idealist schools, but also systematically made significant contributions to the basic principles of dialectical materialism and historical materialism.
　　The main topic of this book is to discuss the relationship between Marxist philosophy and old philosophy. Engels pointed out that the emergence of Marxist philosophy marked the end of old philosophy and was a qualitative leap in the history of philosophy; however, Engels also affirmed the merits of classical German philosophy, explaining that they had created the necessary theoretical prerequisites for the formation of a scientific worldview. In the first chapter, Engels pointed out the contradiction between Hegel's philosophical method and system. On the one hand, Engels affirmed Hegel's idea of development in methodology, pointing out that it contained the revolutionary essence of dialectics, which was a reasonable factor absorbed by Marxism; on the other hand, Engels sharply criticized the reactionary nature of Hegel's objective idealist system, showing the fundamental opposition between Marxist dialectics and Hegel's dialectics. Engels' attitude towards Hegel's philosophy established here fully demonstrates the relationship between Marxist philosophy and old philosophy. This teaches us that we should neither regard the emergence of Marxist philosophy as an accidental phenomenon that is detached from the main road of world human civilization and appears out of thin air, rejecting the quantitative preparations made by old philosophy for the emergence of a scientific worldview; nor should we regard Marxist philosophy as a simple continuation of old philosophy, and ignore that the emergence of Marxist philosophy is a qualitative leap. We know that Lenin in "The Three Sources and Three Component Parts of Marxism" and Stalin in "Dialectical and Historical Materialism" both inherited Engels' idea to express the relationship between Marxist philosophy and old philosophy.
　　In this work, Engels summarized the history of the entire philosophical development and first ingeniously proposed the basic question of philosophy, namely, the relationship between thinking and being. The proposal of this question clarified the various disputes among philosophical schools in the history of philosophy. It is the only criterion for distinguishing all philosophical schools, and at the same time, it is the fundamental basis of the party spirit principle of Marxist philosophy. Based on different answers to the basic questions of philosophy, philosophers are divided into two opposing camps of materialism and idealism, and Marxism firmly stands on the side of materialism. It is impossible to establish a third route beyond these two major factions. Lenin inherited Engels' principle and completely shattered the so-called non-partisan idealist philosophy. Therefore, adhering to the materialist line in philosophy is the most fundamental principle that all Marxists must resolutely abide by.
　　Here, Engels also examined the second aspect of the basic question of philosophy, namely, the question of the cognizability of the world. Engels powerfully exposed the anti-scientific nature of agnosticism, pointing out that the standard of knowledge is practice, and that people can transform the "thing-in-itself" into a thing for us in productive practice, which shows the bankruptcy of all agnosticism. Taking practice as the starting point and criterion of our knowledge is the basis of Marxist scientific epistemology and the weapon we currently use to oppose the agnosticism prevalent in bourgeois philosophy.
　　In addition, Engels also comprehensively discussed the materialism before Marx, including the main limitations of Feuerbach's materialism, namely, its mechanical, metaphysical, and incomplete nature. Engels fairly pointed out that these limitations of the old materialism were inseparable from the limitations of historical conditions and the level of scientific development; only dialectical materialism, which arose under new historical conditions, could overcome these limitations. After criticizing Feuerbach's idealist views on religion and ethics, Engels devoted a special chapter to discussing the revolutionary essence completed by dialectical materialism in history. Finally, Engels also included Marx's "Theses on Feuerbach" as an appendix. In the preface, Engels pointed out that this outline "is the first document containing the genius buds of a new worldview." To systematically understand the history of the formation of the entire Marxist philosophy and to understand the great contributions made by Marxist philosophy in the history of philosophy, we must deeply study Engels' work.
　　Engels' philosophical works are not limited to these three, but these three are the most basic and also the most needed for our current study. With the rapid advancement of my country's socialist construction and socialist transformation, objective conditions are increasingly urgently demanding that we be good at observing new developments to deal with work, and be good at grasping the essential and mainstream aspects from complex phenomena, otherwise we will make mistakes. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in his recent work "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" that the root cause of the error that the leadership is behind the masses on the rural issue is that they cannot see the essential and mainstream aspects of the problem, but instead emphasize those non-essential and non-mainstream aspects, which proves that our comrades are not yet good at applying the weapon of materialist dialectics. We should follow Engels' instructions, take Marxist dialectics as a scientific method for treating all work, be good at specifically analyzing the objectively existing dialectical laws, and use it as a guide for our work and thinking methods, so that we will not lose our way in the face of new environments and new tasks.
　　Secondly, we know that the development of natural science plays a significant role in our country's socialist construction. In our era, natural scientists can fully exert their ambitions and make greater contributions to the country. However, if natural scientists want to truly realize this task, they must better study and master the ideological weapon of dialectical materialism, and they must thoroughly liquidate the influence of bourgeois idealism and metaphysics. In this way, we also need to conduct in-depth research on Engels' philosophical works, especially the book "Dialectics of Nature." Of course, in this book, some individual scientific examples used by Engels may not be consistent with today's new scientific discoveries. However, this is not the main aspect. Here, the most essential aspect is that later natural science has continuously confirmed the correctness of the method used by Engels in development. Therefore, our focus should obviously be concentrated on this aspect, learning the application of Engels' method in analyzing theoretical problems in natural science, and this is exactly what we urgently need.
　　Finally, we must also point out that in-depth study of Engels' philosophical works is also of great significance for us to further carry out the struggle against bourgeois idealism. Engels' life was a life of struggle. From Engels' every work, we can learn how to implement the party spirit of philosophy and how to use the weapon of dialectical materialism to smash all idealist enemies. We will gain more abundant combat power from these great works, so that our criticism of bourgeois ideology will be more in-depth and thorough.

　　学习恩格斯的伟大哲学著作
　　李质明
    科学共产主义的事业永远是和它的创始者马克思、恩格斯的名字分不开的。自从一百多年前（一八四八年），马克思和恩格斯共同向世界人类第一次庄严地宣告了无产阶级的历史使命以后，人类历史前进的每一个迹印都光辉地证实了马克思、恩格斯的全部学说的无比正确性。马克思和恩格斯的学说之所以放之四海而皆准，就在于它是真理，就在于它以一个科学的世界观作为自己全部学说的理论基础，这就是辩证唯物主义。
    我们知道，马克思和恩格斯一起创立了辩证唯物主义，但马克思在毕生的革命工作中，大部分力量是从事于对资本主义社会的全面剖析，因而批判唯心主义哲学和阐述辩证唯物主义的任务，就不能不更多地落在恩格斯的肩头。在这个方面，恩格斯给我们留下了极其宝贵和丰富的遗产，他的这些伟大著作闪烁着不可磨灭的思想光辉。
    恩格斯的“反杜林论”是马克思主义著作中的最杰出的战斗文献之一，它是对马克思主义的三个组成部分——马克思主义哲学、政治经济学和科学社会主义作出完整叙述的第一部著作。恩格斯的这一著作的重大意义实际上是远远地超过了当时对杜林观点进行批判的任务的。
    在“反杜林论”中，对于我们学习马克思主义哲学尤其具有更直接意义的是“序言”和第一编——
  “哲学”，在这里恩格斯系统地对辩证唯物主义的基本原理作了论述。“序言”和“哲学”编的后两节，恩格斯考察了辩证法和形而上学斗争的历史，指出各门科学已有的成果都对形而上学的方法作了全部的否定。恩格斯指出，形而上学是人类认识发展一定阶段的产物，它有其产生的必然，但是，它也将为历史本身所抛弃，让位于更高级的科学的方法论，即唯物辩证法。恩格斯同时也以各门科学的研究成果深刻地证实了辩证规律的客观普遍性，自然界正就是辩证法的试金石。恩格斯给辩证法下了一个经典性的科学定义：辩证法是关于自然、人类社会及思维的一般运动发展规律的科学。恩格斯反对了杜林对马克思主义辩证法的污蔑，划清了马克思主义辩证法和黑格尔的辩证法的界限，并且论述了辩证法的三个基本规律：矛盾的规律，量变过渡到质变的规律以及否定之否定的规律。必须指出，恩格斯在论述否定之否定这一客观普遍的规律的时候，是把否定看作发展联系中的一个积极因素，是新东西对旧东西的批判和继承，因此，否定之否定乃是实现了发展过程的更高阶段，而不是简单的循环。斯大林继承了恩格斯的这一思想，在“辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义”中指出：发展是前进的上升性的运动，是由低级到高级、由简单到复杂的运动。因此，我们不能忽视了这一规律的重要意义，更不能粗暴地认为它是一个过时的东西。举例来说，社会主义社会公有制的建立就是对人类历史中私有制所作的否定之否定，但它又不是简单地重复原始社会的公有制，而是代表着人类更高级的社会发展。这就表明了否定之否定是一个客观的规律。恰好在这里杜林就不懂得，硬把它说成是什么马克思把黑格尔的辩证法当作是“证明的工具”。恩格斯从各门科学中举例说明了否定之否定的客观普遍性，指斥了杜林的无知。在这里，恩格斯同时又教导了我们应当如何来对待马克思主义的辩证法。恩格斯指示我们说，决不能把马克思主义的辩证法看作是“证明的工具”，而应当把辩证法作为研究和认识事物的一种科学方法。这是非常值得我们重视的。有些人不懂得这一点，而把辩证法当作死板的图示到处硬套，这就不是我们马克思主义者对辩证法的态度。
    在“哲学”编里，恩格斯还和杜林的唯心主义观点相对立，系统地论述了马克思主义哲学唯物主义的理论，如关于世界的统一性在于其物质性的原理，关于运动是物质存在的形式的原理，关于时间、空间的客观无限性的原理，以及关于真理、关于自由和必然的唯物主义的解决等等，这都是值得我们重视和认真学习的。
    恩格斯的“自然辩证法”是一部未完成的遗稿，在这部著作里，恩格斯原定的计划是论述自然界的辩证法问题。我们从这一部遗稿中，不难看出恩格斯对于自然科学的重视。恩格斯的这部著作，对于我们，特别是对于迫切地要求掌握马克思主义哲学的自然科学家来说，乃是一部不可不读的著作。
    本书的“导言”部分，是恩格斯已写成的定稿，它有着非常重大的意义。恩格斯在这里全面考察了现代自然科学产生和发展的历史。他指出：自然科学从产生以来就是革命的，自然科学在发展过程中经过了两次大搏斗，首先是解除了宗教的束缚，而后又冲决了形而上学的罗网，这样才使得自己愈来愈和唯物辩证法相结合。自然科学所经历的历程，也就是科学世界观形成的过程；科学的世界观——辩证唯物主义正是在自然科学所达到的这些成就的基础上合乎规律地产生的。换句话说，近代自然科学的发展不可避免地要达到新的科学世界观的结论，而新的科学世界观一旦产生后，又反过来大大促进了各门科学的迅速发展。这就是恩格斯为我们所揭示出的人类认识史的发展规律。
    在“自然辩证法”里，恩格斯反复论述了哲学和科学的相互关系。恩格斯批判了有些自然科学家轻视哲学的看法，恩格斯指出，自然科学家离开了理论思维便不可能前进一步，认为不需要哲学的人，往往正是不自觉地接受了最坏的哲学的影响，因此，?问题不是要使自然科学和哲学完全决裂，而是在于自然科学究竟接受哪一种哲学来作为自己研究的指导。恩格斯总结科学和哲学发展的历史，为自然科学家们指出了一条正确的途径：辩证法对于今天的自然科学家是最重要的思维形式。恩格斯的这一著作，列宁在世时虽然没有机会读到，然而列宁从近代自然科学反对唯心主义的斗争中，却作出了同样的结论，强调指出今天的自然科学家如果不自觉地掌握辩证唯物主义，便无法抵挡唯心主义的侵袭，无法摆脱自然科学的危机，因而也就不可能有更进一步的发展。
    此外，恩格斯还在本书中考察了客观辩证法和主观辩证法的关系，物质运动形式的多样性及其相互转化的辩证规律，以及辩证法诸范畴——因果律、必然和偶然等。在本书的后一部分，恩格斯清算了各门科学中的唯心主义、不可知论以及形而上学，这就为辩证唯物主义在各门科学领域中的指导作用开辟出新的道路。恩格斯的“自然辩证法”乃是巧妙地运用马克思主义辩证法来分析自然科学方面的问题的光辉榜样。我们应当从恩格斯的这本著作里，学习到如何把辩证法运用到自然科学中去，同自然科学中的唯心主义和形而上学观点作斗争。
    “费尔巴哈与德国古典哲学的终结”是恩格斯以无产阶级世界观反对资产阶级世界观的一部杰出的作品。在这部卓越的著作里，恩格斯不仅对各种唯心主义的流派作了无情的揭露和批判，而且系统地在辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的基本原理方面作出了重大的贡献。
    本书的主要课题是论述马克思主义哲学和旧哲学的关系。恩格斯指出：马克思主义哲学的产生是标志着旧哲学的终结，是哲学史中的一个质的飞跃；可是，恩格斯也肯定了德国古典哲学的功绩，说明它们曾为科学世界观的形成创造了必要的理论前提。在第一章里，恩格斯指出了黑格尔哲学的方法和体系之间的矛盾。恩格斯一方面肯定了黑格尔在方法论中的关于发展的思想，指出这里包含着辩证法的革命实质，这是为马克思主义所吸取的合理因素；另一方面，恩格斯又尖锐地批判了黑格尔客观唯心主义体系的反动性，表明了马克思主义辩证法与黑格尔辩证法的根本对立。恩格斯在这里所确立的对黑格尔哲学的态度，完整地表明了马克思主义哲学与旧哲学的关系。这样就教导了我们：既不可把马克思主义哲学的产生看作是一个脱离世界人类文明大道而凭空出现的偶然现象，排斥了旧哲学为科学世界观的产生所作的量的准备；更不可把马克思主义哲学认为是旧哲学的简单继续，而忽视了马克思主义哲学的产生是一个质的飞跃。我们知道，列宁在“马克思主义底三个来源和三个组成部分”里，斯大林在“辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义”中，都正是继承了恩格斯的这一思想来表述马克思主义哲学与旧哲学的关系的。
    在这部著作里，恩格斯总结了全部哲学发展的历史，第一次天才地提出了哲学上的基本问题，即思维和存在的关系问题。这一问题的提出便廓清了哲学史中各个哲学派别的纷纭争执。它是划清一切哲学派别的唯一准则，同时它又是马克思主义哲学党性原则的根本依据。基于对哲学基本问题的不同回答，哲学家分成了唯物主义和唯心主义两个对立的阵营，马克思主义则是坚决站在唯物主义一面的。要想超越于这两大派别之外去建立什么第三条路线，根本就是不可能的事。列宁正是继承了恩格斯的这一原则，彻底粉碎了所谓超党派性的唯心主义哲学。因此，坚持哲学中的唯物主义路线，乃是一切马克思主义者所必须坚决奉行的一个最根本原则。
    恩格斯在这里还就哲学基本问题的第二个方面，即关于世界的可认识性问题作了考察。恩格斯有力地揭露了不可知论的反科学性，指出认识的标准是实践，而人们在生产实践中能将“自在之物”变成为我之物，这就说明了全部不可知论的破产。把实践作为我们认识的出发点和准则，这是马克思主义科学认识论的基础，也是我们当前反对在资产阶级哲学中流行的不可知论的武器。
    此外，恩格斯还全面地论述了马克思以前的唯物主义，其中也包括了费尔巴哈的唯物主义的主要局限性，即机械性，形而上学性和不彻底性。恩格斯公正地指出旧唯物主义的这些局限性都是和历史条件、科学发展水平的限制分不开的；只有在新的历史条件下产生的辩证唯物主义才能克服这些局限性。恩格斯在批判了费尔巴哈的宗教和伦理的唯心主义观点后，以专门一章论述了辩证唯物主义在历史当中所完成的革命的实质。最后，恩格斯还把马克思的“费尔巴哈论纲”作为附录。恩格斯在序言中指出这个提纲“乃是包含着新世界观的天才萌芽的第一个文件”。我们要系统地了解整个马克思主义哲学形成的历史，要了解马克思主义哲学在哲学史上所作出的巨大贡献，就必须深入钻研恩格斯的这一著作。
    恩格斯的哲学著作并不仅限于这三本，但这三本是最基本的，同时也是我们当前最需要学习的。随着我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的迅速推进，客观条件愈来愈迫切地要求我们善于察辨新的发展情况来处理工作，善于从纷纭复杂的现象中去抓住本质的和主流方面的东西，否则我们就会犯错误。毛泽东同志在他最近的著作“关于农业合作化问题”中指出了在农村问题上领导落后于群众的错误在思想方法上的根源就是看不到问题的本质方面，主流方面，而是强调那些非本质方面和非主流方面的东西，这就证明我们的同志还不善于应用唯物辩证法这个武器。我们应当遵从恩格斯的指示，把马克思主义辩证法作为我们对待一切工作的科学方法，善于具体地去分析客观存在的辩证规律，并以它作为我们工作和思想方法的指导，这样，我们才不致在新环境和新的任务面前迷失方向。
    其次，我们知道，在我国社会主义建设过程中，自然科学的发展具有重大的作用。在我们的时代里，自然科学家们完全可以充分发挥自己的抱负而为国家作出更大的贡献的，但是，自然科学家要真正实现这一任务，就不能不更好地学习和掌握辩证唯物主义这一思想武器，就不能不彻底清算资产阶级的唯心主义和形而上学的影响。这样，我们也就有必要来深入研究恩格斯的哲学著作，特别是其中的“自然辩证法”一书。当然，在这本书里，恩格斯所应用的某些个别的科学例证可能与今天科学的新发现不相符合，然而，这不是主要的方面，在这里最本质的方面则是以后自然科学在发展中不断地证实了恩格斯所使用的方法的正确性。因此，我们的着眼点显然应当是集中在这个方面，学习恩格斯分析自然科学理论问题上的方法的应用，而这也正就是我们所迫切需要的。
    最后，我们还必须指出，深入学习恩格斯的哲学著作，对于我们更进一步开展资产阶级唯心主义的斗争也是具有重大意义的。恩格斯的一生就是战斗的一生，我们从恩格斯的每本著作里都可以学习到怎样贯彻哲学的党性，怎样应用辩证唯物主义的武器来粉碎一切唯心主义的敌人。我们将从这些伟大的著作中得到更充沛的战斗力量，从而使得我们对资产阶级思想的批判进行得更深入，更透澈。
