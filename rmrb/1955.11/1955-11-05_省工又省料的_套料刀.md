    Labor-saving and Material-saving "Casing Cutter"
    Liao Ning
    Xu Lian-gui is a technician from the Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory who started as a worker. Not long ago, based on Soviet experience, he created a cutting tool called the "casing cutter." Using this tool for cutting can save a lot of metal materials, greatly improve processing efficiency, and extend the service life of machine tools.
    The Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory produces a large number of various types of rock drills every year. The cylinder body of these rock drills is a round steel tube the size of a thermos bottle liner. In the past, to process this part, the core inside was cut into碎末 (suì mò: tiny pieces) with a drill bit and taken out, wasting two to three kilograms of steel material for each cylinder body made. Xu Lian-gui felt very distressed about this, so he conducted research based on the Soviet expert's suggestion to implement "casing." After more than two years of research, with the help of comrades, on September 3rd this year, he finally successfully trial-produced the "casing cutter." With this cutter, the core that needs to be cut off can be taken out entirely and utilized.
    This tool is also called an annular drill or a hollow drill. Its price is cheaper than solid drill bits and can be widely used on non-ferrous and ferrous metal workpieces. According to the experience of the Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory, it can be used to process workpieces with a diameter of three centimeters or more.
    Using the "casing cutter" can save the country a lot of metal materials. After the Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory used it on a type of rock drill cylinder body, 3.15 kilograms of steel material could be extracted from each cylinder body. This steel material can be used to make many parts such as check valves, and nuts on screw rods, thus increasing the utilization rate of steel materials by 5.96%. From September 4th to 19th, in half a month, this factory extracted 2.021 tons of steel material from the 690 cylinder bodies it had processed. Next year, they plan to use it on eight types of parts, and it is estimated that they can save 24 tons of steel materials a year.
    Using the "casing cutter" can also greatly improve labor productivity. Before using the "casing cutter," the Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory could only make 19 rock drill cylinder bodies of a certain model in eight hours using the old method. After using the "casing cutter," it can now process more than 40 in eight hours, increasing efficiency by more than double. If only the process of machining the inner hole is considered, the efficiency is increased by more than two times. The same results were obtained after using it on other parts. If the speed of the machine tool can be increased, efficiency can be further improved.
    The "casing cutter" has a smaller cutting surface than ordinary drill bits, and the lateral resistance is greatly reduced, which can relatively extend the service life of the machine tool.
    Based on the calculation of various factories in Shenyang under the First Ministry of Machine Building, the promotion of this tool can save at least 200 tons of steel materials per year. (Attached picture)

### 省工又省料的“套料刀”

    省工又省料的“套料刀”
    廖宁
    徐连贵是沈阳风动工具厂的一个工人出身的技术员。不久前，他根据苏联经验创造了一种叫做
  “套料刀”的切削工具。利用这种刀具进行切削，可以节约大量的金属材料，大大提高加工效率，并且延长机床的使用寿命。
    沈阳风动工具厂每年都生产大批各式各样的凿岩机。这些凿岩机的缸体，是一个像热水瓶胆那么大的圆钢筒子。过去加工这种部件，是用钻头把里边的芯子切成碎末掏出来，每做一个缸体，就要浪费两公斤到三公斤的钢料。徐连贵看到很痛心，便根据苏联专家提出的实行“套料”的建议进行研究。经过两年多的研究，在同志们的帮助下，今年九月三日，终于试制成功了“套料刀”，用这种刀可以把需要切削掉的芯子整个掏出来，加以利用。
    这种刀具，也叫环形钻头，或空心钻头。它的价格比实心钻头便宜，在有色金属和黑色金属工作物上可以广泛应用。根据沈阳风动工具厂的经验，凡直径在三公分以上的工作物，都可以用它来加工。
    使用“套料刀”可以给国家节省大量金属材料。沈阳风动工具厂在一种凿岩机缸体上使用后，每一个缸体可以取出三点一五公斤重的钢料。运用这个钢料，可以做阻塞阀、螺丝棒上的丝母等很多部件，因而钢铁材料的利用率较前提高了百分之五点九六。从九月四日到十九日的半个月中，这个厂在已加工的六百九十个缸体中，套下了两吨零二十一公斤钢料。明年他们准备在八种部件上使用，估计一年可以节约二十四吨钢铁材料。
    使用“套料刀”也可以大大提高劳动生产率。沈阳风动工具厂在使用“套料刀”以前，用旧法加工某种型号的凿岩机缸体时，八小时只能做十九个，运用“套料刀”后，八小时内已可加工四十多个，提高效率一倍以上。如果只算加工里眼这道工序，则提高效率达二倍以上。在其他部件上使用后，也得到了同样的效果。如果能把机床的速度加快，效率还可以提高。
    “套料刀”比普通钻头的切削面小，横向阻力也就大大降低，还可以相对地延长机床使用寿命。
    仅就第一机械工业部沈阳各厂的计算，推行后一年中最低也可以节约二百吨以上的钢铁材料。（附图片）
