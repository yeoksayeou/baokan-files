　　Eliminate Medical Accidents
    Medical and preventive work is directly related to the lives of millions of people. Continuously improving the political and ideological level and technical level of health administrative personnel and medical staff, and eliminating medical liability accidents and technical accidents, is an important task for health administrative leading departments and medical and preventive departments at all levels.

    In recent years, thanks to the correct leadership of party committees and governments at all levels and the efforts of all medical staff, medical and preventive work in various regions has been greatly improved. Through various political movements, ideological reforms, and the rectification of medical and preventive departments, the political and ideological level of medical staff has been improved to some extent, and the vast majority of them have demonstrated a positive, responsible, and hardworking work spirit. However, there are still many problems in the current medical and preventive work. The concentrated manifestation of these problems is the low quality of medical care, and medical accidents are still serious and widespread.

    Why do so many medical accidents occur? This is primarily because the political and ideological leadership of medical and preventive departments is weak, and medical accidents are not seriously investigated and dealt with, resulting in a phenomenon of indiscriminate leniency and a lack of clear rewards and punishments. Secondly, some medical staff members are careless and irresponsible in their diagnosis and treatment work and do not care about the suffering of patients. In addition, there are also many shortcomings in the management of medical and preventive departments, such as the lack of strict scientific management systems, unclear division of labor, unclear responsibilities, and lax labor discipline. These are all important reasons for the occurrence of medical accidents.

    Strengthening the Party's leadership and supervision over hospital work, strengthening political and ideological education, correcting the service attitude of medical staff, overcoming bourgeois ideological work styles, establishing a conscientious and responsible work style, carrying forward the glorious tradition of revolutionary humanitarianism, and improving technical level are the basic ways to eliminate medical accidents.

    To eliminate medical accidents, especially medical liability accidents, is an urgent task at present. Some people believe, "Who doesn't encounter a few dead patients in a lifetime of medical work? Whoever encounters it is unlucky!" This is an extremely wrong statement. Doctors who are highly responsible and actively treat patients, if they are unable to save a patient from death due to technical limitations or because the condition is very dangerous, even after making the greatest and final efforts, the people will never blame them. In fact, such deaths do not fall under the category of liability accidents. The medical accidents we are referring to here are those caused by irresponsibility and carelessness. Such medical accidents should of course not occur. Some people say that the occurrence of medical accidents is caused by a shortage of personnel and too much work, being too busy, or poor equipment. This view is also incorrect. Do not doctors with considerable technical expertise and hospitals with good equipment often have medical accidents that should be avoided? Many hospitals with relatively light tasks have not eliminated or reduced the occurrence of medical accidents as a result.

    In some medical and preventive departments, there is a very bad practice: after a medical accident occurs, they do not seriously look for the root cause, examine responsibility, actively improve work, and find ways to prevent it; instead, they hold the attitude of "family scandals should not be made public" and conceal, cover up, perfunctorily deal with, and evade responsibility. Therefore, the vast majority of medical accidents are exposed from the outside by the patient's family or the court, etc. Very few are actively exposed by medical and preventive departments, and even fewer are exposed by medical staff themselves. This situation is also very abnormal.

    It must be affirmed that medical liability accidents should be dealt with seriously, and the causes of the accidents should be carefully identified, and lessons should be summarized to educate the person who caused the accident and other personnel, to improve work and prevent future accidents. In handling medical accidents, neither should we indulge and tolerate, nor should we simply punish.

    Medical work is a complex and meticulous scientific and technical work, and no negligence is allowed. The people must not allow some inexperienced medical staff to experiment on patients. Currently, many practices in medical and preventive departments are not satisfactory. Pharmacies grab medicine without using scales, just by looking at it. Some hospitals allow inexperienced doctors to handle critically ill patients on their own. Many units also require patients to fill out a "voluntary form stating that this unit is not responsible in the event of an accident" when they are hospitalized for surgery. These are all extremely wrong and must be quickly eliminated. Organizational leadership must be strengthened, responsibilities must be clarified, and medical routines must be strictly observed, and work must be carried out in an orderly manner. The responsibility system of personnel at the level of院长 [hospital director] and科主任 [department director] in medical work must be particularly emphasized, and the consultation system must be valued; the phenomenon of disorganization and indiscipline in medical work such as not asking for instructions or reporting must be opposed, as well as the work styles of violating scientific laws, being original, acting recklessly, and subjectivism in diagnostic work. Critically ill patients must be handled under the guidance of experienced doctors, and hospital leaders should also pay attention to having experienced doctors take care of critically ill patients.

    The general affairs and administrative sections of medical and preventive departments must also closely cooperate with the work of medical sections, establish the service concept of "everything for the patient," improve systems, and simplify procedures. Specific tasks such as dispensing medicine and performing laboratory tests must have clear systems and delineation of responsibilities. We must give full play to the spirit of innovation and constantly study and improve the working methods of various departments to cooperate with the medical departments in doing a good job, and take this as our primary task.

    Only by continuously improving the level of medical technology and earnestly learning new scientific and technological achievements can we improve the quality of medical care and reduce and prevent the occurrence of medical accidents. Therefore, doing a good job in business learning in medical and preventive departments, organizing systematic theoretical self-study, and strengthening consultation and case discussion should not be ignored.

    Learning from the advanced medical work experience of the Soviet Union and eliminating the old and unreasonable systems are measures that cannot be ignored to improve hospital work and improve the quality of medical work. It is necessary to plan and create conditions and earnestly promote the advanced Soviet experience of the protective medical system. Facts have proved that after many medical and preventive departments have earnestly studied and promoted these advanced Soviet experiences, the thinking and medical style of medical staff have greatly changed, and work efficiency has also improved. The protective medical system itself is a concrete manifestation of socialist medical thinking and medical style in work, and it runs through the spirit of "everything for the patient." Therefore, the implementation of this system is not only an important reform in medical work, but also has great significance for transforming the thinking and work style of medical staff.

    The national construction cause is developing rapidly, and the quality of medical work must also be rapidly improved to meet the requirements put forward by all parties. Health administrative personnel and medical staff should strengthen their learning, improve their political awareness, establish the idea of serving patients wholeheartedly, heal the wounded and rescue the dying, carry forward the revolutionary humanitarian spirit, and strive to better protect the people's health and lives and for the great socialist cause.

　　消灭医疗事故
    医疗预防工作直接关系着千百万人的生命问题。不断地提高卫生行政人员和医务工作人员的政治思想水平、技术水平，消灭医疗上的责任事故和技术事故，是当前各级卫生行政领导部门和医疗预防部门的一项重要工作。
    几年来，由于各级党委和政府的正确领导和全体医务人员的努力，各地的医疗预防工作有了很大的改进。经过各种政治运动、思想改造和医疗预防部门的整顿工作，医务人员的政治思想水平已经有所提高，他们中间的绝大多数表现了积极负责、任劳任怨的工作精神。但是，在目前的医疗预防工作中，也还存在不少的问题，它的集中表现，就是医疗质量不高，医疗事故仍然严重而且带有普遍性。
    为什么发生许多医疗事故呢？这首先是因为医疗预防部门的政治思想领导薄弱，对医疗事故不作认真追查和处理，一味迁就姑息，形成了好坏不分、赏罚不明的现象。其次是因为一部分医务人员在诊疗工作上粗枝大叶，不负责任，不关心病人疾苦。此外，在医疗预防部门的管理工作方面也有不少缺点，例如缺乏严格的科学管理制度，分工不明，职责不清，劳动纪律松弛，这些都是产生医疗事故的重要原因。
    加强党对医院工作的领导和监督，加强政治思想教育工作，端正医务人员的服务态度，克服资产阶级思想作风，树立认真负责的工作作风，发扬革命的人道主义的光荣传统，提高技术水平，是消灭医疗事故的基本办法。
    要消灭医疗事故，首先是医疗上的责任事故，这是当前的急务。有人认为，“作医疗工作一辈子，谁不碰到几个死亡的病人？谁碰上，谁倒霉！”这是极端错误的说法。凡是能够高度负责地积极地救治病人的医生，如果因为受技术限制，或者由于病情非常危险，虽然尽了最大和最后的努力，仍然不能挽救病人免于死亡，人民是决不会责难他的。事实上，这样的死亡并不属于责任事故。我们这里所指的医疗事故是那些因不负责任、粗枝大叶而引起的。这种医疗事故当然不应该发生。有的人说，医疗事故的发生，都是因为人少事多，忙不过来或者设备太差而造成的。这种看法也不对。有些具有相当技术水平的医生和有着良好设备的医院，不是也常会发生理当避免的医疗事故吗？不少任务较轻的医院，也并没有因此而杜绝或者减少了医疗事故的发生。
    在某些医疗预防部门中有一种很坏的作风，就是发生医疗事故以后，不去认真地寻找根源，检查责任，积极改进工作，想办法来防止它；而是抱着“家丑不可外扬”的态度，隐瞒、掩盖、敷衍、搪塞。所以，绝大部分的医疗事故，都是由病家或者法院等从外部揭发出来的，很少是由医疗预防部门主动地揭发出来的，由医务人员自己暴露的就更少。这种情况也很不正常。
    必须肯定地说，对于医疗责任事故应该进行严肃的处理，并且认真地找出事故的原因，总结教训，来教育造成事故的本人和其他人员，以改进工作，杜绝今后事故的发生。在医疗事故的处理上，既不应当放任姑息，也不应当单纯地惩办。
    医疗工作是一件复杂的细致的科学技术工作，不容许任何疏忽大意。人民决不能容许一些缺乏经验的医务人员在病人身上作实验。目前在不少医疗预防部门中，有很多作法是不能令人满意的。药房抓药不用天秤，瞧着抓。有些医院让无经验的医生独自处理重病人。还有不少单位在病人住院施行手术的时候，要填写一张“万一发生事故与本单位无关”的志愿书。这些都是极端错误的，必须迅速加以革除。必须加强组织领导，明确职责，严格遵守医学常规，有条不紊地进行工作。必须特别强调院长、科主任一级的人员在医疗工作上的责任制，重视会诊制度；反对医疗工作上的不请示、不报告的无组织无纪律现象，以及在诊断工作上违反科学规律、独出心裁、蛮干和主观主义的作风。对于重病人，一定要在有经验的医生指导下进行处理，医院领导方面也应该注意让有经验的医生去照顾重病人。
    医疗预防部门的总务、行政科室，也必须密切配合医疗科室的工作，树立“一切为了病人”的服务观点，改善制度，简化手续。配药、化验等具体工作，必须有明确的制度，并且划清职责范围。必须发挥创造精神，随时研究和改进各科室的工作方法，以配合医疗科室搞好工作，并以此作为自己的首要任务。
    只有不断地提高医疗技术水平，认真学习新的科学技术成就，才能提高医疗质量，减少和防止医疗事故的发生。因而，搞好医疗预防部门中的业务学习，组织系统的理论自修，加强会诊、病历讨论等工作，也都不应当忽略。
    学习苏联先进的医疗工作经验，革除旧的不合理的制度，是改进医院工作、提高医疗工作质量的不容忽视的一项措施。必须有计划地创造条件，认真推行保护性医疗制这一苏联先进经验。事实证明，不少医疗预防部门在认真地学习并推行了这些苏联先进经验以后，医务人员的思想和医疗作风都有了很大的改变，工作效能也有了提高。保护性医疗制本身就是社会主义的医疗思想和医疗作风在工作中的具体化，它贯穿着“一切为了病人”的精神。因此，推行这种制度，不仅是医疗工作中的重要改革，而且对于改造医务人员的思想作风，也有着很大的意义。
    国家建设事业在飞跃发展，医疗工作的质量也必须迅速提高，才能够适应各方面提出的要求。卫生行政人员和医务人员应该加强学习，提高政治觉悟，树立全心全意为病人服务的思想，救死扶伤、发扬革命的人道主义精神，更好地为保护人民的健康和生命，为伟大的社会主义事业而奋斗。
