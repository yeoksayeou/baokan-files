    We Must Re-establish the Cooperative
    Editor:
    After last year's autumn harvest, seeing that agricultural producers' cooperatives could increase income, our mutual aid team of eleven households voluntarily formed a cooperative. As soon as the cooperative was established, we divided the work according to the members' specialties and applied river mud to 80% of the cooperative's paddy fields. Thanks to intensive cultivation, the spring rice in the cooperative also grew particularly well. The members had great confidence in improving production and were determined to run the cooperative well.
    Who knew that this spring, a "resolute contraction" came from above. Township officials said that our cooperative had few core members, many households with difficulties, and a lack of means of production, and wanted us to revert to a mutual aid team. Despite our repeated requests more than ten times, the township still did not allow our cooperative to continue. We had no choice but to reluctantly dismantle a good cooperative. The members sighed and lost heart. They said: Socialism has only gone halfway, and now we are being asked to go back. I was so sad that I couldn't sleep for several nights in a row.
    Once the cooperative was dismantled, it left behind a pile of problems. The members argued endlessly about dividing the river mud and grass seed fields; the accounts of the cooperative were also unclear for a time. People came to me every day, some complaining, some questioning, leaving me dejected and confused. I thought bitterly: The leaders set up the cooperative, but I saw no benefits and heard plenty of scolding. From then on, I became very negative about any work.
    Not long ago, I attended a meeting of the township Party branch and studied Chairman Mao's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation." I felt like I had taken a "heart-clearing medicine." My mind was clear, my eyes were bright, my direction was clear, and my confidence was high. I realized that poor peasants and non-affluent peasants have "no other way out than socialism." Only by participating in cooperatives can we increase production, support the country's industrial construction, and improve our own lives. My past thinking of becoming negative whenever I encountered setbacks was wrong. I am determined to actively walk the path of collectivization with everyone.
    Now, on the basis of voluntary mutual benefit, we have formed a mutual aid joint group of fifteen households, set up a "cooperative framework," unified production arrangements, collectively planted more than fifty mu of grass seeds, and also drawn seven or eight group members to cut green grass, twist river mud, and accumulate soil fertilizer. Everyone is full of confidence and says: We must do a good job in production and welcome the establishment of the cooperative.

### 我们一定要重新把社办起来

    我们一定要重新把社办起来编辑同志：
    去年秋收以后，我们互助组十一户人家看见农业生产合作社能够增加收入，也自动办成了合作社。社一办起，我们就根据社员的特长分工分业，把全社百分之八十的水稻田施上了河泥。由于精耕细作，社里的春花也长得特别好。社员搞好生产的信心很高，下决心一定要把社办好。
    谁知道，今年春季上级来了一个“坚决收缩”，乡里工作人员说我们社里骨干少、困难户多、生产资料缺少，要我们转为互助组。虽然经过我们十多次的请求，乡里还是不允许我们的社继续办下去。我们没有办法，只好忍着心疼把一个好好的合作社拆散了。社员们都唉声叹气，心灰意懒。他们说：社会主义刚刚走到半路，又要我们倒回来。我也难过得接连几夜睡不着觉。
    合作社一拆散，留下了成堆的问题。社员们为了分河泥、分草籽田闹个不休；社里的账目一时也弄不清楚。天天有人跑来找我，有的埋怨，有的责问，弄得我垂头丧气、心里乱腾腾的。我苦恼地想：领导办了合作社，好处没见，骂声听饱。从此，我对什么工作都很消极。
    不久以前，我参加了乡党支部会议，学习了毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的报告。我好像吃了一剂“清心药”，脑子清了，眼睛亮了，方向明了，信心高了。我认识到贫苦的农民和不富裕的农民，“除了社会主义再无别的出路”，只有参加合作社才能提高生产，支援国家工业建设和改善自己生活；我自己过去一受到挫折就消极的思想是不对的。我下定决心，一定要积极同大家一起走合作化的道路。
    现在我们已经在自愿互利的基础上，组成了一个十五户人家的互助联组，搭起了“社架子”，统一安排了生产，集体种了草籽五十多亩，还抽出七、八个组员割青草、捻河泥、积土肥。大家都信心十足地说：要搞好生产，迎接办社。
