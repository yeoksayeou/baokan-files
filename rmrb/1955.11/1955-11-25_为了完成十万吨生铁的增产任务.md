    To Complete the Task of Increasing Production of 100,000 Tons of Pig Iron
    Zhou Chuandian, Deputy Director of the Iron Smelting Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company

    This year, the production situation of the Iron Smelting Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company is better than last year, but it cannot fully complete the state plan, and the cost plan is the worst completed. From January to September, the cost exceeded the budget by 1.26 million yuan, and the situation has not improved. Why? This is mainly because we have not placed the cost plan in the same important position as the production plan. The leadership rarely seriously organizes discussions on the completion of the cost plan, and cadres at all levels generally lack the idea of economic accounting. In the past, although blast furnace sections carried out accounting by furnace, the production leaders did not ask or care, and the shift foremen never explained to the workers. Therefore, the economic accounting work lacked both leadership and a mass base. Only after the launch of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement did the cost overruns attract the attention of our leading staff. However, the blast furnace operators felt that their work was very good and blamed the raw materials section and the pig iron casting section, saying that the loss of ore alone resulted in a loss of more than 1.6 million yuan. The raw materials section also felt that they could not explain their difficulties: the company did not solve the problem of inaccurate measurement, and we had no way to do it! When it came to production, everyone competed for achievements; when it came to cost losses, they pushed the responsibility outwards. This erroneous thinking hindered the development of comprehensive economization work.

    In October, the production meeting convened by the CPC Anshan Municipal Committee seriously criticized the erroneous ideas in the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement, such as complacency and a lack of planning concepts, which sounded the alarm for us. After the meeting, the Party committee focused on examining the complacent emotions that generally existed among all the factory’s employees. Through a series of meetings, such as Party committee meetings, Party member meetings, employee meetings, administrative meetings, and economic activity analysis meetings, in-depth examinations and criticisms were carried out, clarifying many long-standing issues. For example, the loss of raw materials was always considered insurmountable, but after in-depth analysis this time, it was realized that it could be solved through management.

    After correcting our thinking, subjective efforts were strengthened, which led to an initial improvement in the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement. After discussions and supplements by all the factory's cadres, ten economization measures were formulated, with the focus on improving batching and improving operations to reduce or lower the consumption of main raw materials.

    In addition to grasping the main measures, the leadership also carried out in-depth mobilization work. Because the spirit of the Municipal Party Committee's production meeting was repeatedly conveyed, the masses' understanding and enthusiasm were improved. For example, the pipe fitters of the third shift improved the water pipes of the blast furnace cooling system, reducing the number of water outlet pipes by more than 250, and it is estimated that more than 50,000 tons of water are saved every day. The furnace front workers put forward measures such as eliminating residual iron and reducing the number of steel drills claimed, which greatly reduced the consumption of materials. When burning hot blast stoves, the gas workers reduced the amount of gas used because the air and gas were properly matched. The equipment system organized a youth economization team of 115 people, collected a large amount of scrap steel, and revived 20 spare parts, which is estimated to save more than 50,000 yuan.

    Thanks to the efforts of all the employees, coupled with the personal guidance of Soviet experts and the assistance of fraternal factories and mines, production since October has made initial progress. First of all, the situation of cost overruns was reversed. Preliminary statistics for October show that it was reduced by 280,000 yuan compared with the Increase Production and Practice Economy Plan; the quality of pig iron reached the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's standards for the first time. The desulfurization rate of molten iron sent to the steelmaking plant was reduced from more than 10 percent in the past to 5 percent. The blast furnace utilization coefficient has also decreased. In the first half of the year, it was 0.862, in the third quarter it was 0.849, and in October it dropped to 0.814. The blast furnace operating rate also increased from 97.96 percent in the first half of the year to 98.88 percent in October. In October, more than 19,000 tons of pig iron were produced for the country.

    This fact once again shows that as long as we correct our thinking and give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the working masses, it is entirely possible to comprehensively complete the state plan.

    However, this achievement is not stable. The main problem is that the ideological work has not been done sufficiently. Shortcomings such as complacency and inconsistent operation of the three shifts have not been completely overcome, the development of the movement is still unbalanced, and the management work of individual sections is far from keeping up. In order to comprehensively complete the state plan and increase the production of 100,000 tons of pig iron, we must continue to work hard. In the next month or so, we must continue to conduct in-depth inspections of departments and sections, overcome complacency, unify the operation of the three shifts, and strengthen the cooperation between shifts and teams. At the same time, we must establish a regular technical analysis meeting system to improve the technical level of employees. At present, we should focus on combining production and implement the technical guidelines determined by the National Blast Furnace Conference, so as to vigorously promote new technologies. We will extensively carry out economic activity analysis to consolidate and expand the results of economization. We will conduct in-depth publicity of the Five-Year Plan to raise the socialist consciousness of employees; summarize and promote advanced experience, and constantly push the labor competition to a new climax.

    We believe that as long as we follow the instructions of the Party and continue to move forward, we will be able to comprehensively complete the 1955 production plan and lay a good foundation for next year's production, creating favorable conditions for completing the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

    为了完成十万吨生铁的增产任务
    鞍山钢铁公司炼铁厂副厂长　周传典
    今年鞍山钢铁公司炼铁厂的生产情况比去年的好，但是，不能全面完成国家计划，成本计划完成得最不好。从一月到九月成本超支了一百二十六万元，而且情况一直没有好转。为什么呢？这主要是我们没有把成本计划摆在和产量计划同样重要的地位。领导上很少认真组织讨论成本计划的完成情况，各级干部普遍缺乏经济核算思想。过去高炉工段虽然搞过按炉核算，但是生产领导人员不闻不问，值班工长也从不向工人解释。所以，经济核算工作既缺乏领导，又没有群众基础。增产节约运动开展之后，成本超支的情况才引起我们领导工作人员的注意。但是，高炉操作人员认为自己的工作很好，就怪原料工段、铸铁工段不好，光矿石盘亏就损失去了一百六十多万元。原料工段呢，也觉有苦说不出：计量不准确公司不给解决，我们也没有办法啊！谈到生产，大家都争成绩，谈到成本亏损，就把责任往外推。这种错误思想，阻碍了全面节约工作的开展。
    十月间，中共鞍山市委召开的生产会议，严肃地批判了增产节约运动中的错误思想，如骄傲自满情绪，计划观念不强等，给我们敲了警钟。会后，党委着重检查了全厂职工普遍存在着的骄傲情绪，通过党委会、党员大会、职工大会、行政会议和经济活动分析会议等一系列会议，进行了深入的检查和批判，把许多长期搞不清的事情搞清了。例如，原料盘亏一直被认为是无法克服的，这次经过深入的分析，才知道从管理上可以解决。
    端正了思想之后，主观上的努力加强了，使增产节约运动有了初步的好转，经过全厂干部的讨论补充，拟订了十项节约措施，其重点则放在改进配料和改进操作上，以减少或降低主要原材料的消耗。
    领导方面除抓紧主要措施外，又进行了深入的动员工作。由于反复地传达了市委生产会议的精神，群众的认识和积极性提高了。如三班配管工人改进了高炉冷却系统水管，减少出水管二百五十多个，估计每天少用水五万多吨。炉前工人提出消灭残铁和少领钢钎子等措施，大量降低了材料消耗。瓦斯工人在燃烧热风炉的时候，由于风和瓦斯配合适当，减少了瓦斯使用量。设备系统组织了一百一十五人的青年节约队，搜集了大量废钢铁，复活了二十个备件，估计可节约五万多元。
    由于全体职工的努力，再加上苏联专家的亲自指导和兄弟厂矿的协助，十月份以来的生产有了初步的进展。首先扭转了成本超支的局面，十月份初步统计，比增产节约计划降低了二十八万元；生铁质量第一次达到了鞍山钢铁公司的指标。送往炼钢厂的铁水脱硫率，从过去的百分之十以上降低到百分之五。高炉容积利用系数也有了降低，上半年是零点八六二，第三季度是零点八四九，十月份降到零点八一四。高炉作业率也由上半年的百分之九十七点九六，提高到十月份的百分之九十八点八八。十月份，给国家增产生铁一万九千多吨。
    这个事实再一次说明：只要端正思想，发挥职工群众的积极性和创造性，全面完成国家计划是完全可以的。
    但是，这个成绩是不稳固的。主要问题是思想工作还作得不够充分，骄傲自满情绪和三班操作不统一等缺点还没有彻底克服，运动的发展还不平衡，个别工段的管理工作还远远跟不上去。为了全面完成国家计划，并增产生铁十万吨，我们还须再接再厉，在今后的一个多月中，继续深入科室工段的检查工作，克服骄傲情绪，统一三班操作，加强班组之间的配合工作。同时，要建立经常的技术分析会议制度，提高职工的技术水平。目前着重结合生产，贯彻全国高炉会议决定的技术方针，以大力推广新的技术。广泛开展经济活动分析，巩固并扩大节约的成果。深入进行五年计划的宣传，提高职工社会主义觉悟；总结和推广先进经验，不断地把劳动竞赛推向新的高潮。
    我们相信，只要遵循党的指示继续前进，就能全面完成一九五五年的生产计划，并为明年生产打下良好的基础，为提前完成第一个五年计划创造有利的条件。
