Hubei Begins Repairing Farmland Water Conservancy Projects

Hubei Province plans to repair 300,000 small-scale farmland water conservancy projects this winter and next spring. Including the newly built larger projects, it is estimated that the irrigated area can be expanded by 700,000 mu and the irrigation area improved by 3 million mu. In order to strengthen the guidance of this work, the Provincial Water Conservancy Department sent investigators to key townships in May to conduct surveying and design, and began to carry out the overall planning for the development of small-scale water conservancy. At present, 42 townships in 25 counties across the province have completed or are about to complete this plan.

Many areas have started construction one after another. Hanyang County, which started work earlier, plans to repair 469 ponds and weirs, of which 296 have been completed. In the hilly areas of Shishou County, nearly 200 ponds and weirs are under construction, and 12,000 cubic meters of earthwork were completed by the end of October. (Yuan Jun)

　  湖北开始整修农田水利工程
    湖北省今冬明春要整修小型农田水利工程三十万处，连同新建较大的工程在内，预计可以扩大灌溉面积七十万亩，改善灌溉面积三百万亩。为了加强对这一工作的指导，省水利厅在今年五月就派调查人员到重点乡进行勘测设计，开始进行发展小型水利的全面规划工作，目前全省已经有二十五个县的四十二个乡完成和就要完成这一规划。
    很多地区已陆续开工，动工较早的汉阳县，计划整修四百六十九口塘堰，已经有二百九十六口完工。石首县丘陵地区正在施工的将近二百口塘堰，十月底完成土方一万二千立方公尺。（袁军）
