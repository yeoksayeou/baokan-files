Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 16th: According to TASS, after the United Nations General Assembly's Political Committee, under the manipulation of the United States, refused to invite a representative from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to participate in discussions on November 11th, it began a general debate on the Korean question.

　　At the November 11th meeting, the US representative, Mr. Brower, spoke and viciously slandered the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China. The British representative, Mr. Dixon, repeated the US representative's "arguments" in his speech. The US and British representatives did not put forward any constructive suggestions for resolving the Korean question.

　　At the meeting on the 14th, the Canadian representative, Mr. Martin, said that he agreed with the view that the unification of Korea could only be achieved through negotiations between the North and the South, and that the United Nations should promote this. He also expressed agreement with the statement that if the United Nations took an "overly irreconcilable attitude" on this issue, the credibility of the United Nations would be damaged. Martin emphasized that Canada's support for one side in the Korean conflict in 1950 did not mean that Canada would support that side's position on all issues thereafter.

　　The Soviet representative, Mr. Malik, then spoke. He pointed out that the United Nations General Assembly, under pressure from certain groups of countries, was continuing to discuss the Korean question without the participation of representatives from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China. He emphasized that the vital interests of the Korean people and the interests of consolidating peace urgently required a speedy resolution of the issue of unifying Korea on a peaceful and democratic basis. It was intolerable that Korea should continue to be divided into two parts, becoming a source of international tension in the Far East.

　　Malik went on to say that the resolution of the Korean question was primarily a matter for the Korean people themselves. The Soviet delegation believed that the responsibility of the countries concerned was not to force their own opinions and decisions on the Koreans, but to help the Koreans find a way to restore national unity on a peaceful and democratic basis. The Soviet Union, as in the past, believed that it was essential to achieve the unification of Korea by means of free all-Korean elections conducted on the basis of agreements reached between South and North Korea, without foreign interference and without any pressure on voters. The Soviet Union advocated genuine free elections in Korea, which should not be presided over by foreigners, but should be conducted by the Koreans themselves under the supervision of impartial international bodies.

　　Malik pointed out that in studying the Korean question, one could not ignore the fact that there were now two governments on the territory of Korea. Therefore, under the present conditions, the unification of Korea was only possible on the basis of an agreement reached between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea that took into account their mutual interests and the interests of the entire Korean people. It was therefore clear that, under the present conditions, it was of paramount importance to the cause of a peaceful resolution of the Korean question to establish and develop links between North and South Korea, so that they could move closer together in order to reach an agreement on the restoration of national unity in the future. In this regard, Malik spoke of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's proposals to establish an all-Korean committee, convene a conference of representatives from North and South Korea, and other proposals to strengthen ties between North and South Korea to promote unification. He pointed out that the Soviet government and the governments of the People's Republic of China and many other countries supported these proposals. In this regard, Malik believed that the proposal made by Indian Prime Minister Nehru in the Indian Upper House last May that North and South Korea should establish a "joint body of a temporary nature" was noteworthy.

　　Malik pointed out that the current movement in South Korea to carry out aggression against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea would create serious obstacles to resolving the Korean issue on a peaceful and democratic basis.

　　When Malik spoke of the South Korean authorities' expansion of armaments and demands for the abolition of the armistice agreement, he pointed out that some people regarded this agreement as an obstacle on the road to realizing their aggressive plans. In this regard, one could not but take note of the position adopted by the US representative. In his speech on the 11th, the US representative defended South Korea's intensified military preparations, saying that they were "in accordance with the terms of the armistice agreement." However, it was very clear that such an increase in military potential under the conditions of the armistice was a complete violation of the purposes of the above-mentioned agreement and posed a direct threat to the maintenance of peace in Korea.

　　Malik concluded by saying that the Soviet government had repeatedly advocated continuing negotiations on the Korean issue. The Soviet government fully agreed with the view expressed by the governments of the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea that a conference of relevant countries must be convened to resolve the Korean issue. However, the US and British representatives, as in the previous session of the United Nations General Assembly, once again opposed the convening of such a conference. Malik said that in the completely abnormal situation where the most relevant countries were deprived of the opportunity to state their views on the Korean issue, discussions on the Korean issue in the United Nations could not yield good results. Therefore, the necessity of convening a conference of relevant countries to discuss the Korean issue became even more apparent. Such a conference would help resolve the outstanding issues in Korea and further ease international tensions, and would make a valuable contribution to the cause of consolidating peace and cooperation.

　　在联大政委会十四日会议上
　　马立克主张召开有关国家会议解决朝鲜问题
    新华社十六日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会政治委员会十一月十一日在美国操纵下拒绝邀请朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表参加讨论以后，开始对朝鲜问题进行一般性辩论。
    在十一日会议上，美国代表布劳斯坦发言，他大肆诽谤朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国。英国代表狄克逊在发言中重复美国代表的“论据”。美英两国代表对朝鲜问题的解决根本没有提出任何建设性的建议。
    在十四日会议上，加拿大代表马丁发言说，他同意这种意见：要统一朝鲜只有通过北部和南部之间的谈判，而联合国应当促进这件事情。他还表示同意这种说法：如果联合国在这个问题上采取“过份不调和的态度”，那末联合国的威信就要受到损害。马丁强调说，加拿大在一九五零年支持朝鲜冲突的一方并不表示加拿大以后在一切问题上也支持这一方的立场。
    苏联代表马立克接着发言。他指出，联合国大会在某些国家集团的压力下是继续在没有朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国代表参加的情况下讨论朝鲜问题的。他着重说，朝鲜人民的切身利益和巩固和平的利益迫切要求在和平和民主的基础上尽速解决统一朝鲜的问题。不能够容忍这种不正常的情况：朝鲜继续被分裂成两部分，成为远东的国际紧张局势的根源。
    马立克接着说，朝鲜问题的解决首先是朝鲜人民自己的事情。苏联代表团认为，有关国家的责任不是强迫朝鲜人接受自己的意见和决定，而是要帮助朝鲜人去寻找在和平和民主的基础上恢复国家统一的道路。苏联和过去一样，认为非常必需的是，通过在南朝鲜和北朝鲜达成协议的基础上、在没有外国干涉和不对选民施加任何压力的条件下进行全朝鲜自由选举的办法达成朝鲜的统一。苏联主张在朝鲜实行真正的自由选举，这种选举不应当由外国人主持，而应当由朝鲜人自己在公正的国际机构的监督下主持。
    马立克指出，在研究朝鲜问题的时候，不能不考虑到现在在朝鲜的领土上存在着两个政府的事实。因此，在目前的条件下，要统一朝鲜，只有在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和大韩民国达成考虑到它们相互的利益和整个朝鲜人民的利益的协议的基础上才有可能。由此可见，在目前的条件下，对和平解决朝鲜问题的事业有首要意义的是，建立和发展北朝鲜和南朝鲜的联系，为了在今后达成关于恢复国家统一的协议而使它们互相接近起来。在这方面，马立克谈到朝鲜民主主义人民共和国关于成立一个全朝鲜委员会、召开南北朝鲜代表会议以及其他关于加强南北朝鲜的联系以促进统一的建议。他指出，苏联政府和中华人民共和国以及其他许多国家的政府都支持这些建议。在这方面，马立克认为，印度总理尼赫鲁去年五月在印度国会上院演说中提出的北朝鲜和南朝鲜应建立一个“临时性质的共同机构”的主张是值得注意的。
    马立克指出，目前南朝鲜掀起的对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国实行侵略的运动，将为在和平和民主的基础上解决朝鲜问题造成严重障碍。
    马立克谈到南朝鲜当局扩充军备、要求废除停战协定的时候，指出某些人士认为这个协定是实现他们的侵略计划的道路上的障碍。在这方面，不能不注意到美国代表所采取的立场。美国代表在十一日发言中为南朝鲜加紧军事准备辩护，说什么这是“符合停战协定条款”的，然而十分清楚，在停战条件下这样增加军事潜力完全违反上述协定的目的，并且对朝鲜和平的维持造成直接的威胁。
    马立克最后说，苏联政府一再主张继续就朝鲜问题举行谈判。苏联政府完全同意中华人民共和国政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府所表示的必须召开有关国家的会议来解决朝鲜问题的这种看法。但是美国和英国代表同在联合国大会上届会议中一样，再次反对召开这种会议。马立克说，在最有关的国家被剥夺机会陈述自己对朝鲜问题的观点这种完全不正常的情况下，在联合国讨论朝鲜问题是不能得出良好的结果的。因此，召开有关国家讨论朝鲜问题的会议的必要性就更加明显了。这种会议将有助于解决朝鲜悬而未决的问题和进一步缓和国际紧张局势，并且会对巩固和平和合作的事业作出宝贵的贡献。
