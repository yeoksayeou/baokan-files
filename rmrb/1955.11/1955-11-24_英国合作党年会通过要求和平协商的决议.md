Xinhua News Agency, London, 22nd: According to TASS, the British Cooperative Party held its 29th annual meeting in London on the 19th and 20th. Three hundred and eighty-four representatives from seventy-nine local organizations of the Cooperative Party, including six members of Parliament, attended the meeting.

　　The chairman of the annual meeting, Bell, in his opening speech, criticized the government's blatant attack on the living standards of the working people, condemned the atomic arms race, and accused the West of attempting to continue its "policy of strength" which hindered the achievement of the Geneva Four Foreign Ministers' Conference. Bell called for "abandoning this bad practice" and stopping the implementation of Britain's current foreign policy.

　　The annual meeting discussed and adopted the report of the party's political committee. The section of the report on foreign policy issues stated: "The high-level talks held in Geneva in July of this year have clearly demonstrated that a policy based on the threat of atomic war is futile and useless, and the lessons learned from last year's Geneva conference on Far Eastern issues are also very important. It is now undeniably clear that, as long as there is a desire, Western countries can sit at the same table with the Soviet Union and reach agreements through peaceful negotiations."

　　The report advocated the establishment of a "satisfactory collective security system through the United Nations, rather than military alliances. … In Europe, efforts should be made to draft an all-European security pact in which Germany and the Soviet Union, as well as the United States, participate."

　　The representatives unanimously adopted the part of the report that called for a complete ban on all kinds of weapons of mass destruction, and passed the following resolution: "The participants of the annual meeting express their firm opposition to the production of weapons of mass destruction on territory controlled by the British government, opposition to the storage of such weapons, and opposition to the use of such weapons based on this territory."

　　The representatives also unanimously passed a resolution demanding that the People's Republic of China obtain its seat in the United Nations, and demanding that the British and American governments recognize Taiwan as an inseparable part of the People's Republic of China. The report firmly condemned the United States for supporting the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek regime with force.

　　The section of the report on domestic issues expressed concern about the continuous decline in the living standards of the broad masses of the British population, condemned the supplementary budget proposed by the government which would increase the heavy burden on the working people, and called for a struggle against the new attack by capital on the people's living standards.

　　The representatives also insisted on passing a special resolution condemning the British government for using armed forces to suppress the national movement in Cyprus.

　　英国合作党年会通过要求和平协商的决议
    新华社二十二日讯　据塔斯社伦敦讯：英国合作党十九日和二十日在伦敦举行第二十九届年会。参加年会的有合作党七十九个地方组织的三百八十四个代表，其中有六个议员。
    年会主席贝尔在开幕词中抨击政府公然向劳动人民的生活水平进攻，谴责原子军备竞赛，并且指责西方企图继续执行“实力政策”而妨碍了日内瓦四国外交部长会议获得成就。贝尔号召“放弃这种恶劣的手法”，停止执行英国目前的外交政策。
    年会讨论和通过了党的政治委员会的报告。报告中关于外交政策问题部分说：“今年七月在日内瓦举行的高级谈判，明确地证明了以原子战争的威胁为基础的政策是枉然无益的，去年举行的关于远东问题的日内瓦会议得出的教训也是非常重要的。现在，已经可以无可争辩地看出，只要具有愿望，西方国家是能够同苏联坐在一张桌子旁边，而且能够以和平的谈判方式达成协议的。”
    报告主张通过联合国建立“令人满意的集体安全体系，而不要军事联盟。……在欧洲应当努力设法草拟德国和苏联以及美国都参加的全欧安全公约。”
    代表们一致通过报告中要求完全禁止各种大规模毁灭性武器的部分，并且通过了下列决议：“年会参加者表示坚决反对在英国政府控制的领土上生产大规模毁灭性武器，反对储存这种武器，并且反对以这种领土为基地使用这种武器”。
    代表们还一致通过要求让中华人民共和国获得它在联合国里的席位，并且要求英国和美国政府承认台湾是中华人民共和国的不可分离的一部分。报告坚决谴责美国以武力支持蒋介石卖国政权。
    报告中关于内政问题的部分对英国广大居民阶层生活水平的不断降低表示担心，谴责政府提出的给劳动人民增加沉重负担的补充预算案，并且号召为反对资本对人民生活水平的新进攻而斗争。
    代表们还坚持通过特别决议，谴责英国政府用武装力量镇压塞浦路斯的民族运动。
