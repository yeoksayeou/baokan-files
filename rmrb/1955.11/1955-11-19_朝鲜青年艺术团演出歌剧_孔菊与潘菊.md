Xinhua News Agency, 18th: The Korean Youth Art Troupe gave its premiere performance at the Tianqiao Theater in Beijing on the evening of the 18th, staging the five-act grand opera "Kongjwi and Patjwi."

　　"Kongjwi and Patjwi" is based on a popular Korean folk tale, written by Zhao Lingchu and composed by Li Mianxiang. The opera depicts the diligent and kind Kongjwi being abused by her stepmother and stepsister Patjwi, but with the support of righteous forces, she finally achieves happiness, while those who abuse Kongjwi are scorned by the people and ultimately punished. The opera expresses the spirit of the Korean people who love labor and justice, pursue freedom and happiness, and oppose slavery and oppression, with clear love and hate.

　　During tonight's performance, Wang Shanhua, the Korean youth art performer who played Kongjwi, Li Jiongshu who played Patjwi, and Jiang Shunzi who played the stepmother, all successfully portrayed the images of these different characters. The melodies and rhythms of the music in the opera have a strong Korean national character. The beautiful Korean folk dances interspersed throughout the play, as well as the accompanying orchestra, coordinated harmoniously with the development of the plot.

　　Those present to watch tonight included Chen Yi, Vice Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, Qian Junrui, Acting Minister of Culture, Chen Kehan, Deputy Minister, Luo Yi and Zhang Ze, Secretaries of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth, Tian Demin, Chairman of the All-China Students' Federation, Yang Hansheng, Vice President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, people from all walks of life in the capital, and personnel from the Embassy of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in China.

　　After the art troupe's performance, young literary and art workers from the capital presented them with flowers. Chen Yi, Qian Junrui, Luo Yi, Zhang Ze, and others went on stage to congratulate them on the success of their performance.
