Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 10th: According to TASS, the Political Committee of the UN General Assembly began discussing on the 9th the proposal by the Colombian representative that the Political Committee begin discussing the Korean question. The items included in this agenda question are as follows: the report of the United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea, the report of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, and the issue of former Korean prisoners of war.

After the Colombian representative spoke, Soviet representative Malik spoke. He pointed out that during the previous review of the procedural issues regarding the discussion of agenda items for the Political Committee, the Soviet delegation had suggested beginning a discussion on disarmament issues. Malik said that, considering the previous decision of the Political Committee, we are not formally proposing this issue now, but we still believe that it would be appropriate for the Political Committee to begin discussing disarmament issues if possible.

British representative Dixon opposed the Soviet opinion.

Indian representative Menon pointed out that the Disarmament Commission has not yet submitted a report to the General Assembly that should be discussed by the Political Committee, and he argued that the report must be submitted as soon as possible.

The committee decided to begin discussing the Korean question without a vote. Following this, Syrian representative Shukairy suggested inviting representatives from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and South Korea to participate in the discussion of the Korean question. Shukairy explained his reasons for this suggestion, saying that the issue the Political Committee would be discussing is related to the fate of all of Korea, so both sides should be heard. He emphasized that refusing to listen to one side is very unfair. He pointed out that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is a signatory to the Korean Armistice Agreement, and the Political Committee cannot ignore its existence. He said that inviting representatives from North Korea to participate in the discussion of the Korean question would be a step towards establishing a unified country in Korea.

After the Syrian motion was proposed, U.S. representative Wadsworth proposed a motion to postpone the discussion of this proposal, citing the excuse that the person in the U.S. delegation responsible for this issue was unable to attend the meeting. Wadsworth said that the U.S. delegation had "great objections" to the Syrian representative's proposal. British representative Dixon supported the U.S. representative's opinion.

The Political Committee finally decided to continue discussing the issue of inviting representatives from North Korea and South Korea to participate in the discussion at the afternoon session on the 10th.

　　联合国大会政治委员会开始讨论朝鲜问题
    新华社十一日讯　据塔斯社纽约十日讯：联合国大会政治委员会九日开始讨论哥伦比亚代表提出的主张政治委员会开始讨论朝鲜问题的建议，这个列在议程中的问题包括以下三项：联合国朝鲜统一复兴委员会的报告，中立国遣返委员会的报告和朝鲜前战俘问题。
    在哥伦比亚代表发言以后，苏联代表马立克发言。他指出，在上次审查关于政治委员会的议程项目的讨论程序问题时，苏联代表团曾经建议开始讨论裁军问题。马立克说，由于考虑到政治委员会上次的决定，我们现在对这个问题不提出正式的建议，但是我们仍然认为：政治委员会如果能够开始讨论裁军问题，那是适宜的。
    英国代表狄克逊反对苏联的意见。
    印度代表梅农指出：裁军委员会直到现在还没有向大会提出应当由政治委员会进行讨论的报告，他主张必须尽快提出这个报告。
    委员会不经过表决就决定开始讨论朝鲜问题。接着发言的叙利亚代表舒凯里建议邀请朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和南朝鲜的代表参加讨论朝鲜问题。舒凯里申述他提出这个建议的理由说，政治委员会将讨论的这个问题是同整个朝鲜的命运有关的，所以应当听取双方的意见。他着重说，拒绝倾听某一方的意见是很不公正的。他指出，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国是朝鲜停战协定的缔约一方，政治委员会不能忽视它的存在。他说，邀请北朝鲜的代表参加讨论朝鲜问题，将是向在朝鲜建立一个统一的国家的方面迈进一步。
    在叙利亚的动议提出后，美国代表华兹沃斯提出了延期讨论这个动议的建议，他的借口是，美国代表团中负责这个问题的人没有能够出席会议。华兹沃斯说，美国代表团对叙利亚代表的建议有“很大的反对意见”。英国代表狄克逊支持美国代表的意见。
    政治委员会最后决定在十日下午会议上继续讨论邀请北朝鲜和南朝鲜代表参加讨论的问题。
