The agricultural cooperativization movement in the agricultural areas of Qinghai Province is developing vigorously. To date, 1,181 new agricultural production cooperatives have been established throughout the province. Together with the 876 old cooperatives, there are a total of 2,057 agricultural production cooperatives. Another 853 new cooperatives have also been set up. The number of participating farmers (including those in the old cooperatives) has reached 98,269 households, accounting for 50.9 percent of the total number of farm households in the province. The movement is still developing and it is expected that several hundred more agricultural production cooperatives will be established before the spring plowing next year. The number of participating farmers will reach 55 to 60 percent of the total number of farm households in the province.

The upsurge in Qinghai Province's agricultural cooperativization movement emerged after studying Comrade Mao Zedong's report and the resolutions of the Party Central Committee, and continuously criticizing right-leaning ideas. Whether in Han Chinese areas, minority areas, or areas with mixed ethnic groups, and whether in plains or mountainous regions, farmers of all ethnic groups, especially poor and lower-middle peasants, are vying to sign up to join agricultural production cooperatives. In Hualong Salar Autonomous County, among the more than 2,580 farmers currently requesting to join cooperatives, more than 1,700 are Salar farmers, more than 500 are Tibetan farmers, and more than 100 are Hui farmers. The county has newly established 37 agricultural production cooperatives; Mutual Assistance Tu Autonomous County has established 39 new cooperatives, and another 156 cooperatives have been set up. A total of more than 11,500 Tu, Han, Tibetan, and other ethnic farmers in the county have now decided to join or participate in old cooperatives, accounting for 63.6 percent of the total number of farm households in the county.

In the process of establishing cooperatives, party organizations at all levels correctly implemented the party's class policy in rural areas. According to investigations, the vast majority of farmers who joined the cooperatives this time are poor peasants and lower-middle peasants among the new and old middle peasants, and in most areas, poor and lower-middle peasants have an advantage in the leadership of the new cooperatives. Among the 1,136 farmers who newly joined cooperatives in Nianbo District, Ledu County, there are a total of 863 poor and lower-middle peasants, accounting for 75.9 percent of the total number of farmers joining cooperatives. Among the cadres of all newly established cooperatives in Hualong Salar Autonomous County and the key members of cooperative establishment who are being trained, about 60 percent are poor peasants, and the remaining part is mostly lower-middle peasants.

　　青海省农业区半数农户参加农业合作社
    青海省农业区农业合作化运动正在蓬勃展开。到目前为止，全省已经新建立一千一百八十一个农业生产合作社，连同八百七十六个老社在内，共有两千零五十七个农业生产合作社。另有八百五十三个新社也已搭起了架子。入社农户（连老社在内）达九万八千二百六十九户，占全省总农户数的百分之五十点九。运动现在仍然在继续发展中，预计在明年春耕以前还可以建立几百个农业生产合作社。入社农户将达到全省总农户数的百分之五十五到六十。
    青海省农业合作化运动的高潮是在学习毛泽东同志的报告和党中央的决议并不断批判右倾思想后出现的。不论汉民族地区、少数民族聚居地区或民族杂居地区，也不论川地或山地地区，各族农民特别是贫农和下中农，争先恐后地报名参加农业生产合作社。循化撒拉族自治县目前要求入社的两千五百八十多户农民中，撒拉族农民就有一千七百多户，藏族农民五百多户，回族农民一百多户。全县已经新建三十七个农业生产合作社；互助土族自治县已建立三十九个新社，还有一百五十六个社已搭好了架子。全县现在已确定准备入社或参加老社的土、汉、藏等族农民共一万一千五百多户，达全县总农户数的百分之六十三点六。
    在建社过程中，各级党组织正确地贯彻执行了党在农村中的阶级政策。据调查，这次新入社的农民绝大部分是贫农和新、老中农中的下中农，大部分地区贫农和下中农在新社领导力量中占了优势。乐都县碾伯区新入社的一千一百三十六户农民中，贫农和下中农共有八百六十三户，占入社总农户数的百分之七十五点九。循化撒拉族自治县所有新建社的干部和正在培养的建社骨干，百分之六十左右都是贫农，其余部分下中农占绝大多数。
