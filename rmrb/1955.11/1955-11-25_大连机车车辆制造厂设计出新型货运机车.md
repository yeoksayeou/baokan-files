Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Works Designs New Freight Locomotive

　　(Our dispatch) Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Works design personnel recently completed the technical design of a new type of freight locomotive, which has been reviewed and approved by a review committee jointly formed by the First Ministry of Machine Building and the Ministry of Railways. This is the first locomotive designed by China itself.

　　The design of the new locomotive adopts the new achievements of Soviet locomotive manufacturing and therefore has many advantages. Its tractive force is 41 percent greater than that of the MK1 locomotive currently used extensively on China's railway lines, and its maximum horsepower is 80 percent greater than that of the MK1 locomotive, while its coal consumption is 42 percent less than that of the MK1 locomotive, and the amount of metal used per unit horsepower is 28.5 percent less. The design of the new locomotive pays special attention to improving the working conditions of the crew: coal is not added manually, but by an automatic coal feeder that can deliver six tons of coal per hour. This type of locomotive is designed entirely according to China's existing railway conditions and the expected increase in freight volume in the future, and will therefore be the most suitable type of locomotive for China.

　　The design work for the new locomotive began in January of this year. The entire design process was carried out under the specific guidance of Soviet experts. The technical data provided by the Soviet Union on various locomotives, especially the complete set of drawings for the new “Л” type locomotive, was a great help in the design of the new locomotive. Various railway departments in China also provided assistance in all aspects during the design process of the new locomotive. More than one hundred design personnel at the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Works spent a great deal of effort to find the best design from many design proposals.

　　Currently, the designers are working on the construction drawings for the new locomotive.

　　大连机车车辆制造厂设计出新型货运机车
    本报讯　大连机车车辆制造工厂设计人员不久前完成了一种新型货运机车的草图技术设计工作，已经经第一机械工业部和铁道部联合组成的审核委员会审核批准。这是我国第一次自己设计的机车。
    新机车的设计采用了苏联制造机车的新成就，因此具有很多优点。它的牵引力比目前我国各铁路线上大量使用的冖ㄎ1型机车大百分之四十一，最大马力比冖ㄎ1型机车大百分之八十，而它的耗煤量却比冖ㄎ1型机车少百分之四十二，单位马力的金属使用量少百分之二十八点五。新机车的设计特别注意了改善乘务人员的劳动条件：加煤不用人力，而由每小时可以送煤六吨的自动加煤机加煤。这种机车完全是根据我国现有铁路条件和将来货运量增加的情况设计的，因此将是我国最适用的一种机车。
    新机车的设计工作是从今年一月份开始的。整个设计过程都是在苏联专家的具体指导下进行的。苏联供给的各种机车的技术资料，特别是新型的
  “Л”型机车的整套图纸，对新机车的设计是一个巨大的帮助。我国各铁路部门在新机车的设计过程中，也给予了各方面的帮助。大连机车车辆制造工厂的一百多个设计人员，花费了巨大的力量，从许多设计方案中找出了最好的方案。
    目前，设计师们正在进行新机车的施工图的设计工作。
