The CCP Shandong Provincial Committee, Gansu Provincial Committee, Heilongjiang Provincial Committee, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Party Committee separately convened various meetings to convey and discuss the resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party, and to deploy work on developing and consolidating agricultural production cooperatives.

The CCP Shandong Provincial Committee held a meeting of prefectural and county party secretaries from October 17th to 20th. The meeting considered that, according to the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party, to intensify the work of rectifying and consolidating agricultural production cooperatives in a planned, led, and step-by-step manner is an extremely important and arduous task for party committees at all levels in Shandong Province at present. The meeting studied the development plan for agricultural production cooperatives in the province in the future, planning to basically complete the semi-socialist cooperation after two more winter and spring seasons on the basis of this upsurge. To this end, it is necessary to carry out the work of rectification and consolidation of the cooperatives, and at the same time, prepare a plan for phased and batch development; at the same time, start piloting a number of advanced agricultural production cooperatives and strengthen the work of state-owned farms. In order to ensure the healthy development of the agricultural cooperative movement, the meeting considered that it is necessary to firmly grasp the party's policies. The meeting emphasized that after the great development of cooperatives, uniting the working peasants outside the cooperatives is more important than before. The meeting considered that it is very important to strengthen the work in backward villages, and it is necessary to adhere to the policy of first transforming and then establishing cooperatives, starting from solving the current urgent demands of the masses, deeply mobilizing the masses, first solving the remaining problems of land reform and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and combining party rectification to solve impure problems within the party, in order to eliminate obstacles; on this basis, cooperatives will be established in batches according to possible conditions. The meeting pointed out that it is necessary to raise revolutionary vigilance, prevent and suppress all destructive activities of the enemy; at the same time, attention should also be paid to treating and handling different objects differently. The meeting considered that after the great development of agricultural production cooperatives, major changes have taken place in the rural situation. At present, the movement is at a critical juncture of shifting from development to rectification and consolidation, and the leadership must ensure that the existing 180,000 cooperatives are truly well-managed and prepare to welcome the production upsurge next year.

At the Fifth Plenary (Enlarged) Meeting of the Chinese Communist Party Gansu Provincial Committee held from October 25th to 29th, the attendees, according to the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party, conducted a concentrated and sharp criticism of the right-leaning thoughts, decentralism, and procrastination that have always hindered the development of the agricultural cooperative movement and other work, and eliminated the main ideological obstacles to the great development of the agricultural cooperative movement in Gansu Province. The attendees unanimously agreed with the major modifications made by the Standing Committee of the CCP Gansu Provincial Committee to the originally formulated agricultural cooperative plan for Gansu Province. The revised agricultural cooperative plan for Gansu Province stipulates that from now until the autumn harvest of 1956, 16,849 new agricultural production cooperatives will be established, plus the existing cooperatives, for a total of 24,000 cooperatives, with peasant households joining the cooperatives accounting for 30% of the total number of peasant households; by the autumn harvest of 1957, the province's cooperatives will develop to 47,300, with peasant households joining the cooperatives accounting for 60% of the total number of peasant households; by the autumn harvest of 1958, the province's cooperatives will develop to 50,000, with peasant households joining the cooperatives accounting for more than 80% of the total number of peasant households, and the province will basically achieve cooperation. In order to strengthen the party's leadership role in the agricultural cooperative movement, the province plans to develop more than 120,000 new party members in rural areas by 1958. The number of rural Communist Youth League members will reach 480,000 by 1958.

The Enlarged Plenary Session of the CCP Heilongjiang Provincial Committee held from October 28th to 30th pointed out that since the popular transmission of Chairman Mao's report among party members, Communist Youth League members, and the masses throughout the province began in mid-August, cadres at all levels have changed their right-leaning thoughts in the agricultural cooperative movement, the socialist enthusiasm of the masses has been continuously improved, and there have been many new changes in rural class relations and the dynamics of various strata. At present, more than 80% of the poor peasants, lower-middle peasants, and a large number of upper-middle peasants outside the cooperatives in the province are demanding to join the cooperatives. The plans of various counties to develop agricultural production cooperatives have also been revised several times. The cooperative movement is developing rapidly in Heilongjiang Province, and by the spring of next year, the number of peasant households joining the cooperatives in the province can reach about 70% of the total number of peasant households. The meeting considered that the main problems in the agricultural cooperative movement in Heilongjiang Province are still that the leadership lags behind the mass movement, right-leaning conservative thoughts have not been completely overcome, propaganda and education are not deep and widespread enough, the planning work in some places is divorced from the mass movement, the correct implementation of the class line, the combination of party rectification and cooperative construction, and the work in weak villages all need to be further strengthened. Therefore, the meeting decided to combine the autumn harvest distribution work of the old cooperatives, continue to widely and deeply study and publicize Chairman Mao's report and the resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party, continue to overcome right-leaning thoughts, correctly implement the guidelines, policies, and methods instructed by the Central Committee, further encourage the enthusiasm of the masses for cooperation, and ensure the healthy development of the cooperative movement.

The CCP Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee convened a meeting of responsible party member cadres from the directly affiliated organs of the Party Committee and the Autonomous Region People's Committee on October 27th. Ulanhu, Secretary of the CCP Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee, delivered a report on conveying the resolutions and spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party. Comrade Ulanhu pointed out that in the past, some comrades mistakenly believed that Inner Mongolia was a minority nationality area, and the socialist transformation of agriculture could be carried out slowly. In the past, this "slowly" was only considered a question of the speed of socialist transformation, but in essence, it was a question of class stand, a question of whether it conformed to the Party's general line during the transition period. He said that through the criticism of right-leaning thoughts in agricultural cooperation, we have a clearer understanding of the road to socialist transformation of animal husbandry. In the past, we also had some shortcomings in developing mutual assistance and cooperation in pastoral areas, which were not bold and open enough. Ulanhu pointed out that, according to the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party, to lead the agricultural cooperative movement in the Inner Mongolia region, it is expected that a cooperation upsurge will arrive in the entire region this winter and next spring. The entire region will basically realize cooperation after about three major waves, by 1958. This winter and next spring is the first major wave. It is estimated that before the spring plowing next year, the number of peasant households joining the cooperatives can reach about 35%, from the current 17.2% of the total number of peasant households. The next five months is a very important juncture. Ulanhu called on all party members and cadres in the Inner Mongolia region to be urgently mobilized and go all out. All departments should make overall plans around the agricultural cooperative movement.

    中共山东、甘肃、黑龙江等省委开会确定
    加强对农业合作化运动的领导
    本报讯　中共山东省委员会、甘肃省委员会、黑龙江省委员会和内蒙古自治区党委会分别召开了各种会议，传达和讨论党的七届六中全会（扩大）的决议，布置发展和整顿农业生产合作社的工作。
    中共山东省委员会在十月十七日到二十日召开了地委书记和县委书记会议。会议认为，根据党的七届六中全会（扩大）精神，有计划有领导有步骤地加紧进行整顿巩固农业生产合作社的工作，是目前山东省各级党委的一个极为重要而艰巨的任务。会议研究了今后全省农业生产合作社的发展规划问题，计划在这次高潮的基础上，再经两个冬春，基本上完成半社会主义的合作化。为此，在当前既要进行整顿巩固社的工作，又要准备分期分批发展的规划；同时，开始试办一批高级的农业生产合作社，并加强国营农场的工作。为了保证农业合作化运动的健康发展，会议认为必须切实掌握党的政策。会议强调指出，在合作社大发展之后，团结社外劳动农民比以前有更大的重要性。会议认为加强落后乡村的工作十分重要，必须坚持先改造后建社的方针，从解决当前群众迫切要求入手，深入发动群众，首先解决土地改革遗留问题和镇压反革命问题，结合整党解决党内不纯问题，以扫除障碍；在这个基础上，再根据可能条件分批建立合作社。会议指出，必须提高革命警惕，防止和镇压敌人的一切破坏活动；同时，也要注意按照不同对象有区别地对待处理。会议认为，农业生产合作社大发展后，农村情况已经发生了重大的变化。目前运动又处于由发展转向整顿巩固的关键时机，领导方面必须保证现有的十八万个合作社真正办好，准备迎接明年生产高潮。
    中国共产党甘肃省委员会十月二十五日到二十九日举行的第五次全体（扩大）会议上，到会人员根据党的七届六中全会（扩大）的精神，对一向妨碍农业合作化运动的发展和其他工作的右倾思想、分散主义和拖拉现象，进行了集中的、尖锐的批判，扫除了甘肃省农业合作化运动大发展的主要思想障碍。到会的人一致同意中共甘肃省委常务委员会对原来制定的甘肃省农业合作化规划所作的重大修改。修改后的甘肃省农业合作化规划规定：从现在到一九五六年秋收前新建一万六千八百四十九个农业生产合作社，加上原有的合作社，共达二万四千个合作社，入社农户占农户总数的百分之三十；到一九五七年秋收前，全省的合作社将发展到四万七千三百个，入社农户占农户总数的百分之六十；到一九五八年秋收前，全省合作社将发展到五万个，入社农户占农户总数的百分之八十以上，全省基本上达到合作化。为在农业合作化运动中加强党的领导作用，全省计划到一九五八年要在农村发展十二万名以上的新党员。农村青年团员到一九五八年要发展到四十八万名。
    中共黑龙江省委员会在十月二十八日到三十日举行的全体会议（扩大）指出，自八月中旬开始在全省党员、团员和群众中普遍地传达毛主席的报告以来，各级干部在农业合作化运动中的右倾思想已有转变，群众的社会主义积极性不断提高，农村阶级关系和各阶层动态有许多新的变化。目前全省已有百分之八十以上的社外的贫农、下中农和很大一部分社外的上中农要求入社。各县发展农业生产合作社的计划也都已经修订了几次。合作化运动正在黑龙江省迅速发展，到明年春季全省入社农户可达农户总数百分之七十左右。会议认为，黑龙江省目前农业合作化运动中的主要问题仍然是领导落后于群众运动，右倾保守思想还没有彻底克服，宣传教育不够深入和广泛，有的地方的规划工作同群众运动脱节，阶级路线的正确执行、结合整社建社进行整党建党工作以及薄弱村的工作，也都须进一步加强。因此，会议决定，结合老社的秋收分配工作，继续广泛深入地学习和宣传毛主席的报告和党的七届六中全会（扩大）的决议，继续克服右倾思想，正确贯彻执行中央指示的方针、政策和办法，进一步鼓舞群众的合作化积极性，保证合作化运动的健康发展。
    中共内蒙古自治区党委在十月二十七日召开了党委直属机关和自治区人民委员会的负责党员干部会议，中共内蒙古自治区党委书记乌兰夫作了关于党的七届六中全会（扩大）的决议和精神的传达报告。乌兰夫同志指出，过去我们曾有某些同志错误地认为内蒙古是少数民族地区，农业的社会主义改造工作可以慢慢来。过去对这个“慢慢来”只认为是社会主义改造的速度问题，而实质上这是一个阶级立场问题，是一个是否合乎党在过渡时期的总路线的问题。他说，通过对农业合作化中的右倾思想的批判，使我们对牧业社会主义改造的道路更加明确了，过去我们对发展牧业区的互助合作也有某些不够大胆放手的毛病。乌兰夫指出，根据党的七届六中全会（扩大）的精神来领导内蒙古地区的农业合作化运动，预计在今冬明春全区的合作化高潮就会到来。全区大约经过三个大浪潮，到一九五八年就可基本实现合作化。今冬明春是第一个大浪潮，估计到明年春耕前，入社农户可以由现在占总农户的百分之十七点二达到百分之三十五左右。今后这五个月的时间是一个非常重要的关头，乌兰夫号召内蒙古地区全体党员、全体干部必须紧急动员起来，全力以赴。各部门都应围绕农业合作化运动，做出全面规划。
