Go Where Weaknesses Lie First

The Yancheng County Party Committees in Jiangsu Province are concentrating their efforts on rectifying and consolidating the newly established agricultural producers' cooperatives. To do this work well, each district first convened a meeting of mutual aid and cooperation representatives. Through these district meetings, the county committee ascertained the situation of the new cooperatives and the opinions of the masses, and formulated rectification plans for different regions. After making comprehensive arrangements, the county committee selected more than fifty staff members to form fifteen rectification work groups, led by the county party secretary and others, to go to areas where the cooperative foundation was relatively weak and new cooperatives had developed more rapidly, to assist in the rectification work and to absorb and promote the experience of rectifying new cooperatives.

In the rectification work, each district also started with rectifying some of the new cooperatives with more problems and the weakest ones. In general areas, the method of "old cooperatives leading new cooperatives, advanced cooperatives leading general cooperatives" was adopted to carry out the rectification and consolidation work. More problems were encountered in the weaker areas, and the rectification experience gained in these areas was also richer. In this way, the county and district committees' guidance on the rectification work could be more effective; the phenomenon of "advanced always advanced, backward always backward" could be avoided.

    哪里薄弱先到哪里去
    江苏省盐城县各级党委正在集中全力整顿巩固新建立的农业生产合作社。为了把这个工作做好，各区先召开了互助合作代表会议；县委通过各区的会议，摸清了新社的情况和群众的意见，制定了不同地区的整社计划。作了全面的安排以后，县委又抽调五十多个工作人员，组成了十五个整社工作组，由县委书记等人率领，到合作化基础比较弱而新社发展得比较多的地方，去协助整社工作，吸取和推广整顿新社的经验。
    在整社工作当中，各区也都是先从问题比较多的、最薄弱的一些新社开始整顿，一般地区，采取“老社带新社、先进社带一般社”的办法进行整顿巩固工作。在薄弱地区碰到的问题比较多，在这些地区取得的整社经验也就比较丰富。这样，县委区委对整社工作的指导就可以比较有力；“先进的老先进，落后的老落后”的现象，也就可能避免。
