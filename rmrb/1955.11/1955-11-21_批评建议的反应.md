Responses to Criticism and Suggestions

    The No. 1 Power Plant of the Xiangzhong Electric Power Bureau writes that the criticism of our plant's waste of coal on the "Letters from Readers" page on August 21 is completely correct. In the first quarter of this year, the combustible content in our plant's coal slag was very high, resulting in serious waste. We have now strengthened our efforts to conserve coal, mobilized employees to plug loopholes in coal consumption, and the combustible content in coal slag has gradually decreased. Since August, we have exceeded the state's coal consumption plan.
