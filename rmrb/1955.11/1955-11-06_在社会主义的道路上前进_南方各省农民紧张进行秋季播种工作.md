Advancing on the Socialist Road
Farmers in Southern Provinces Intensively Carrying Out Autumn Sowing

    This newspaper reports: Farmers in the southern provinces are intensively carrying out autumn sowing.

    After widespread rainfall in Jiangsu Province on October 27th, farmers in various regions, under the leadership of agricultural cooperatives, are seizing the opportunity to actively plant crops while the soil is still moist. In Dantu County, farmers planted more than 40,000 mu of wheat on the first day after the rain. After the rain, the Hai'an County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party organized more than 30 cadres to go to various districts to assist in mobilizing the masses to seize the time to plant crops while the soil was moist. The county has already planted more than 460,000 mu. The autumn sowing of more than 4.3 million mu of dry land and rice-wheat fields in Yancheng Prefecture was basically completed by the end of October, and cotton-wheat intercropping areas are being intensively sown. Areas with less rainfall are continuing to organize the masses to combat drought and rush to plant.

    Autumn sowing in various parts of Zhejiang Province generally began in mid-October. In many areas, farmers intercrop rape in green manure crop fields and implement intercropping of wheat and green manure crops, and intercropping of wheat and broad beans. This can maintain soil fertility and expand the planting area of green manure crops and rape.

    Farmers in Fuyang, Suxian, Wuhu, and Lu'an Prefectures of Anhui Province are overcoming passive waiting for rain and fighting against drought and hardship to intensify autumn plowing and sowing. As of October 24, Fuyang Prefecture had planted more than 6.79 million mu of wheat, barley, rape, and other crops while fighting drought. Suxian Prefecture had sown more than 7.89 million mu. Since late August, there has been very little rain in various parts of Wuhu Prefecture. Some mountainous areas in southern Anhui have not had rain for more than 80 days. In order to lead the farmers to complete the autumn sowing tasks in a timely manner, the prefectural and various levels of Party committees are currently vigorously mobilizing the masses to dig ditches to divert water, using waterwheels to irrigate the fields, and plowing and planting while harvesting. As of October 24, the entire prefecture had planted more than 762,000 mu while combating drought.

    Farmers in Jiangxi are actively carrying out autumn sowing under the slogan of "doing a good job in production and developing agricultural cooperatives". The autumn sowing plan formulated by various townships and villages in the province this year is more than 23.533 million mu. Jiujiang Prefecture, which has implemented the plan best, exceeded the original autumn sowing plan by more than 100,000 mu. At present, winter planting has been fully launched in various places. As of October 25, the province had sown more than 3 million mu of various green manures.

    Due to the earlier season, mountainous areas in Xiangyang and Enshi Prefectures of Hubei Province have fully carried out sowing, and some high mountain areas have ended the sowing work. The vast plains and hilly areas, such as Huanggang, Xiaogan, and Jingzhou Prefectures, have had no rain for a long time, and farmers are actively combating drought and planting.

    As of October 20, farmers in Hunan Province had sown more than 367,000 mu of rape. Autumn sowing in the northern and central regions of Guangxi Province is very intensive, and farmers in the southern regions are carrying out preparations such as accumulating fertilizer and selecting seeds. Farmers in various parts of Guangdong Province are preparing to carry out autumn sowing immediately after the autumn harvest.

    This year, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangxi, Guangdong and other provinces plan to further utilize winter fallow fields and expand the autumn planting area. The agricultural and grain departments of these provinces have transferred a large number of seeds to the countryside.

    南方各省农民紧张进行秋季播种工作
    本报讯　南方各省农民正紧张进行秋季播种工作。
    江苏省在十月二十七日普遍得雨后，各地农民在农业社的带动下，抓紧时机积极趁潮抢种。丹徒县农民在雨后第一天即抢种小麦四万多亩。中共海安县委雨后组织干部三十多人，分赴各区协助发动群众趁潮抢种，全县已种四十六万多亩；盐城专区四百三十多万亩旱作和稻麦地的秋种工作到十月底已基本完成，棉麦夹作地区正紧张播种。降雨较少的地区，仍在继续组织群众，抗旱抢种。
    浙江省各地十月中旬普遍开始秋种，许多地区的农民在绿肥作物田里套种油菜，并且实行小麦和绿肥作物间种、小麦和蚕豆间种，这样可以保持土地的肥力，又可扩大绿肥作物和油菜的种植面积。
    安徽省阜阳、宿县、芜湖、六安等专区农民，克服消极等雨思想，向干旱困难作斗争，加紧秋耕秋种。到十月二十四日止，阜阳专区已抗旱抢种小麦、大麦、油菜等午季作物六百七十九万多亩，宿县专区已下种七百八十九万余亩。芜湖专区各地自八月下旬以来就很少下雨，江南部分山区已八十多天没有落雨，地委及各级党委为了领导农民适时完成秋种任务，目前正大力发动群众挖沟引水，车水润田，边收边耕边种。到十月二十四日止，全专区已抗旱播种七十六万二千多亩。
    江西各地农民在搞好生产，发展农业合作社的口号下，积极地进行秋季播种。全省各乡、村今年制定的秋种计划为二千三百五十三万三千多亩。计划贯彻最好的九江专区，超过原订秋种计划十多万亩。目前各地冬种已全面展开，到十月二十五日止，全省已播种各种绿肥三百多万亩。
    湖北省襄阳、恩施两专区的山区因季节较早已全面进行播种，有的高山地区已结束了播种工作。广大平原、丘陵地区如黄冈、孝感、荆州等专区因很久无雨，农民正在积极抗旱播种。
    湖南省农民到十月二十日已播种油菜三十六万七千多亩。广西省北部和中部地区秋种已很紧张，南部地区农民正在进行积肥、选种等准备工作。广东省各地农民准备在秋收之后立即进行秋种。
    今年浙江、江西、湖南、广西、广东等省都计划进一步利用冬闲田，扩大秋季种植面积。这些省的农业、粮食等部门已调运大量种籽运往农村。
