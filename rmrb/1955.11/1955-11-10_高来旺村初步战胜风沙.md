    Gaolaiwang Village Initially Triumphs Over Wind and Sand
    Yan Shugui
    Minqin County in Gansu Province is closely connected to the Mongolian Autonomous Prefecture. To its north and west lies a vast, seemingly endless desert. The farmers who live here are tenaciously fighting against the wind and sand to prevent their fields from being buried. Gaolaiwang Village is located near the desert. In recent years, under the leadership of the Party, the villagers have overcome the wind and sand, ensuring increased agricultural production.
    Gaolaiwang Village is bordered by the Bagou Caiwan sand dune to the west and the Hesheng Gou sand dune to the east. This village used to be quite prosperous. Some elderly people still speak of its past history with a sense of pride. At that time, the area of land here was quite large, producing a lot of grain. Every year, in addition to self-sufficiency, it supplied large quantities of wheat and millet to other places. People called it "Little Grain Mountain." However, wind and sand disasters brought poverty to this village. Whenever a strong wind blew, yellow sand flew, and fertile fields near the desert were gradually turned into desert. According to the elders, in the early years of the Republic of China, this village had more than 5,900 mu of land, but before liberation, only more than 4,000 mu remained.
    After liberation, the Party studied the wind and sand situation in Minqin County and decided to plant trees and create forests to prevent wind and sand and protect farmland. In 1952, Gaolaiwang Village selected Yuan Chengbing and three others to study forestry at the county's forestry training class. After they returned, they led the farmers in planting trees and creating forests. At that time, many people were skeptical about afforestation. They felt that they lacked afforestation technology and experience and were worried that they would not be able to protect the trees after they were planted. Therefore, only some rural youths and a few adults planted 258 trees and pressed 100 willow stakes under the organization of the Communist Youth League branch that year. After the trees were planted, a forest protection agreement was announced at a mass meeting of the whole village, stipulating that livestock owners should be responsible for compensation if livestock damaged the trees. Afterward, the survival rate of the trees planted this time reached 96 percent, and they grew very well. This fact powerfully educated the masses and changed their original views, so mass afforestation activities began in 1953. By the spring of this year, all the farmers in the village, except for a few landlords and rich peasants, had participated in afforestation. Now the afforestation area in the village has reached 270 mu, with more than 50,000 trees, forming a three-li-long shelterbelt on the southwest side of the village. The trees planted earlier have grown to more than one person high. In the past few years, the villagers have also repaired and reinforced 11 li of windbreak walls and newly inserted one li of windbreak walls. In addition, they also used clay to bury sand dunes with an area of five mu and tried to grow sand-fixing crops such as yellow artemisia, alkali seepweed, and big-seed sand millet. These efforts have greatly prevented the intrusion of wind and sand, ensured increased agricultural production, and enabled farmers to live and work in peace and contentment. Wang Yiwo, a farmer, had 30 mu of land completely buried by sand, and a large amount of sand accumulated next to his house. Now that the shelterbelt passes behind his residence, he has rebuilt seven new houses and planted crops nearby. Farmer Wang Zaotong's family has 50 mu of land near the desert. In the past, he could only plant autumn crops on this land every year and harvest some grain. He could not plant summer crops because he was afraid of being attacked by wind and sand and harvesting nothing. Now the situation has changed, and wheat has been planted. Last year, in addition to leaving enough for his own consumption, he also sold 2,000 jin of wheat to the state. Due to the development of wind and sand prevention work, Gaolaiwang Village has also opened up a lot of fertile land and expanded the cultivated area. There are 300 mu of land in Shangsanfentan that have been buried by sand for more than 20 years. Now, due to the planting of trees, the attack of wind and sand has been prevented, and the land can also be cultivated. Last year, this piece of land harvested more than 20 dan of millet.
    The achievements in preventing wind and sand have further encouraged the fighting spirit of the farmers in Gaolaiwang Village. Under the slogan of "Overcoming Wind and Sand and Opening up Fertile Land," they want to strive for greater achievements. Next year, they plan to plant another 50 or 60 mu of forest in the sand dunes. For this reason, they have cultivated a large number of seedlings.

    高来旺村初步战胜风沙
    燕树桂
    甘肃省民勤县紧连着蒙古自治州，在它的北部和西部，是一片茫茫看不到尽头的沙漠。住在这里的农民，为了不让田地被沙石掩没，顽强地同风沙斗争。高来旺村是靠近沙漠的一个村庄，几年来党领导着农民，战胜了风沙，使农业增产得到了保证。
    高来旺村的西边是八沟财弯沙窝，东边是河盛沟沙窝。这个村庄原来是相当富裕的，一些老年人谈起来总还是带着几分自豪的心情叙述它以往的历史。那时，这里的土地面积相当大，出产粮食很多，每年除自给外，还供给别的地方大量小麦、糜子，人们称她为“小粮山”。但是风沙灾害给这个村庄带来了贫穷。每当大风一起，黄沙飞扬，靠近沙漠的良田，一片一片的变成沙漠。据老年人谈，在民国初年，这个村庄还有五千九百多亩土地，到解放前只留下四千多亩。
    解放后，党研究了民勤县的风沙情况，决定植树造林，防治风沙，以保护良田。一九五二年，高来旺村选派了袁承炳等四个人在县上的林业训练班学习造林。他们回来后，便领导农民进行植树造林工作。当时，许多人对造林很怀疑。他们感到没有造林技术和经验，还担心种上树木后保护不住。所以，这一年只有一些农村青年和个别成年人在团支部的组织下栽种了二百五十八株树，压了一百墩柳条。栽树之后，在全村群众大会上宣布了护林公约，规定牲口踏坏树木畜主要负责赔偿。事后，这次栽种的树成活率达到百分之九十六，而且长得很好。这件事实有力地教育了群众，改变了他们原来的看法，因而从一九五三年开始了群众性的造林活动。到今年春天，除几户地主富农外，全村农民都参加了造林。现在全村造林面积已达二百七十亩，共有树木五万多株，在村庄西南面已形成了一个长三华里的防护林带。栽种较早的树木，已长得一人多高。在这几年中，农民还修补和加固了十一华里长的防风墙，新插了一华里防风墙。此外，还用黏土埋压了面积五亩地大的沙丘，试种了黄蒿酸、胖沙糜子等防沙的作物。这些工作大大制止了风沙的侵入，保证了农业增产，使农民能够过着安居乐业的日子。农民王已我过去有三十亩地全被沙子掩没，而且连房子旁边也堆积了大量沙子。现在防护林带经过他的住宅后面，重新盖起了七间新房，并在附近播种了庄稼。农民王早同老汉，家有五十亩地靠近沙漠，以前每年只能在这些土地上种秋田收一些粮食，不能种夏田，怕被风沙袭击落得颗粒不收。现在情况改变了，已经种上了麦子。去年，他除留下自己够吃的以外，还卖给国家二千斤小麦。高来旺村由于防风沙工作的开展，还拓出不少良田，扩大了耕地面积。在上三分滩有三百亩土地，被沙子埋压了二十多年。现在由于栽种了树木，防止了风沙的袭击，土地也可以耕种了。去年这块土地收了二十多担糜子。
    防治风沙获得的成果，进一步鼓舞了高来旺村农民的斗争情绪。他们在“战胜风沙、拓出良田”的口号下，要争取更大的成绩。明年他们计划要在沙窝里再造林五、六十亩，为此他们已育了大量树苗。
