Xinhua News Agency, 29th. The Secretary-General of the All-China Sports Federation, Rong Gaotang, wrote to the Secretary-General of the Philippine Amateur Athletic Federation on the 29th to discuss the issue of pre-Olympic matches between the Chinese and Filipino soccer teams who will be competing at the 16th Olympic Games in 1956.

In his letter, Rong Gaotang said that according to the decision of FIFA, the Chinese soccer team will hold pre-Olympic matches with the Filipino soccer team to qualify for the 1956 Olympic Games; the Chinese government has agreed to issue passports to the Chinese soccer team so that they can travel to the Philippines to compete; at the same time, the Chinese government has also stated that it can provide visas for the Filipino soccer team to enter China; he believes that the pre-Olympic matches between China and the Philippines will definitely be successfully conducted in an atmosphere of friendship.

In his letter, Rong Gaotang suggested that the referees for this competition should preferably be international referees from Asian countries.

Regarding the dates of the competition and where to play first, Rong Gaotang hoped to first know the opinions of the Philippine Amateur Athletic Federation. Rong Gaotang said that according to the decision of FIFA, in addition to the pre-Olympic matches between the Chinese and Filipino soccer teams having to be completed before August 1, 1956, it is suggested that the pre-Olympic match in China be held in Beijing in June next year.

Rong Gaotang hopes to receive a reply from the Secretary-General of the Philippine Amateur Athletic Federation soon, and requested that he send a copy of the reply to Mr. Mayer, Secretary-General of the International Olympic Committee, and Mr. Gassmann, Secretary-General of FIFA.

According to the Olympic Charter, no more than sixteen teams may participate in team events at the Olympic Games. If there are more than sixteen teams, all teams must hold pre-Olympic matches before the Olympic Games are held. More than twenty soccer teams have signed up for the 16th Olympic Games in 1956. China is in the same group as the Philippines in the pre-Olympic matches. According to FIFA regulations, the pre-Olympic matches must be played on each other's soil to determine the winner.

　　我国体育总会秘书长写信给菲律宾业余体育联合会秘书长
　　商讨两国足球队进行预选赛问题
    新华社二十九日讯　中华全国体育总会秘书长荣高棠二十九日写信给菲律宾业余体育联合会秘书长，商讨中、菲两国参加一九五六年第十六届奥林匹克运动会的足球队在会前进行预选赛的问题。
    荣高棠的信中说，根据国际足球联合会的决定，中国足球队将同菲律宾足球队进行一九五六年奥林匹克运动会足球赛的预选赛；中国政府已经同意发给中国足球队护照，以便他们前往菲律宾比赛；同时中国政府也表示可以给菲律宾足球队进入中国的签证；相信中国和菲律宾之间的预选赛必定能够在友谊的气氛中圆满地进行。
    荣高棠在信中建议这次比赛的裁判最好由亚洲国家的国际裁判来担任。
    关于比赛的日期和先在那里比赛这两个问题，荣高棠希望先知道菲律宾业余体育联合会的意见。荣高棠说，根据国际足球联合会的决定，除了中、菲两国足球队的预选赛必须在一九五六年八月一日以前结束外，建议在中国的一场预选赛最好在明年六月间在北京举行。
    荣高棠希望很快地得到菲律宾业余体育联合会秘书长的复信，并且请他把复信抄送给国际奥林匹克委员会秘书长麦耶先生和国际足球联合会秘书长加斯曼先生。
    按照奥林匹克运动会宪章规定，参加奥林匹克运动会团体比赛项目的，不得超过十六队。如果超过了十六队，所有的队必须在奥林匹克运动会举行前进行预选赛。这次报名参加一九五六年第十六届奥林匹克运动会的足球队有二十多队。中国在预选赛中同菲律宾编在一组。根据国际足球联合会的规定，预选赛必须在双方国土上各赛一场，以决定优胜。
