The transportation departments have already done much work on passenger transport that satisfies travelers, striving to reduce their feelings of "travel fatigue" and "home is good for a thousand days, but going out is difficult for even one." However, the passenger transport work on highways and inland rivers in some places is still far from satisfactory. Passengers not only do not feel comfortable and convenient, but even safety has become a problem.

A "Hu Ci" ship in Hunan, on October 2nd, sailing from Hehuazui to Caowei, the Caowei station had already sold more than thirty extra passenger tickets. They called the Yuanjiang station to sell fewer tickets, but the person in charge of the Yuanjiang station said: "The Caowei station can sell extra tickets, why can't we?" He insisted on selling nineteen extra tickets as well. As a result, the ship was crowded with passengers, and the safety of the voyage was affected. Some ships simply didn't stop at stations, leaving passengers with tickets for intermediate stations waiting in vain.

On the highway from Gaotingsi to Yongxing in Hunan, the bus only had twenty-nine seats, but once they sold thirty-five tickets. Furthermore, the carriage was already full of passengers in advance, leaving only about ten seats in reality. The carriage was very short, so many passengers had to bend over or sit on the floor, huddling together and enduring aching backs and legs for nearly two hours before getting off the bus.

These situations should attract the attention of the relevant departments in charge, and they should find ways to improve them.

### 客运必须注意安全

　  客运必须注意安全
    交通运输部门对客运的工作，已经做了不少为旅客所满意的事情，力求减少他们“舟车劳顿”和“在家千日好，出门一日难”的感觉。可是，有些地方公路、内河的客运工作仍然很难令人满意。旅客不但感不到舒适、方便，连安全也成了问题。
    湖南的一艘“湖慈”轮，十月二日从荷花嘴开往草尾，草尾站已经多售了三十多张客票，打电话通知沅江站少卖票，沅江站的负责人却说：
  “草尾站多卖得票，我们就多卖不得？”他偏偏也多卖了十九张客票。这样，船上旅客拥挤，航行安全也受到影响。有的轮船干脆到站不停，使中途站买了票的旅客白等一场。
    湖南高亭司到永兴这一段公路上，汽车里只设二十九个座位，有一次就卖出三十五张车票，而车厢里已预先坐上了很多乘客，实际上只剩下十来个座位。车厢很矮，很多旅客只得弯腰曲背或坐在地板上，身子缩作一团，挤了近两个钟头才忍着腰酸腿痛下了车。
    这些情况，应该引起有关主管部门的注意，设法改善。
