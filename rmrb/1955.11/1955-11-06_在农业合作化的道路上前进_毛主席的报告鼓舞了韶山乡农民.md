    Advancing on the Road of Agricultural Cooperativization
    Chairman Mao's Report Inspires Farmers in Shaoshan Township
    Editor:
    On the morning of October 18th, the newspaper carrying Chairman Mao's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" was delivered to the Shaoshan Township government. The staff of the township government and nearby farmers immediately scrambled to read the newspaper, and everyone discussed it enthusiastically. At one o'clock in the afternoon, the Shaoshan Township Party Branch convened a joint meeting of branch committee members, key township staff, and agricultural cooperative chairpersons. Branch Secretary Mao Wei'ang read the entire report aloud in one breath. After listening, everyone was very happy and said in unison: What Chairman Mao said struck a chord in our hearts, it’s just like Chairman Mao has returned to his hometown! Township Head Peng Renguang said: "Chairman Mao is in Beijing, but he seems to have seen through the situation in his hometown. His words have raised our awareness and increased our confidence and strength in building socialism." Mao Renqiu, director of the Township Mutual Aid and Cooperation Committee, cited many vivid examples to illustrate the high enthusiasm of farmers in Shaoshan Township for taking the socialist road, and powerfully criticized the right-leaning thinking of the branch in leading the cooperative movement. He said: "In our township, thirteen agricultural cooperatives were established last winter and this spring, with the number of households joining the cooperatives accounting for more than 60 percent of the total number of households in the township. At that time, I was worried about problems, so I advocated 'stopping here.' In fact, more and more farmers are eager to join the cooperatives. Fourteen of the fifteen mutual aid teams in the township have applied continuously for four or five times, and have voluntarily formed six joint mutual aid teams. Poor peasant team member Li Guhuan has requested to join the cooperative countless times from spring plowing to now. Although it has not been approved, he has never wavered. But our own awareness is not high. Just as Chairman Mao said, we are 'afraid of the dragon in front and the tiger behind,' worried that the branch will not be able to lead too many cooperatives. According to Chairman Mao's report, we have not only failed to actively lead the masses to take the socialist road, but also dragged the masses backward." At the meeting, everyone unanimously stated that they would resolutely act in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, overcome right-leaning thinking, and strive to lead the farmers of the entire township to advance bravely on the socialist road.
    On October 19th, Shaoshan Township held a township people's representative meeting, and also used small meetings for study; blackboard newspapers, big-character posters, and loudspeakers were also used for publicity. In this way, the vast number of farmers' demands for cooperativization became more urgent. Cooperative members said that they would work hard to run the cooperatives well, and mutual aid teams would strive to become cooperatives as soon as possible. Many poor peasants said excitedly: We know that Chairman Mao will not forget us, he has answered our request to join the cooperatives.
    Now, the farmers in Chairman Mao's hometown, like farmers in other parts of the country, are welcoming the new high tide of cooperativization with excitement and encouragement.

    在农业合作化的道路上前进
    毛主席的报告鼓舞了韶山乡农民编辑同志：
    十月十八日上午，登载着毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的报告的报纸送到了韶山乡政府。乡政府的工作人员和附近的农民马上争着来看报，大家热烈地谈开了。下午一点钟，韶山乡党支部召集了支部委员、乡主要工作人员和农业社长的联席会议。支部书记毛伟昂一口气将报告全文宣读了一遍。大家听了以后非常高兴，异口同声地说：主席说的话句句打在我们心坎上，真像主席回了家乡一样呀。乡长彭仁广说：“主席在北京，好像把家乡的情况都看透了底。他的话使我们提高了觉悟，增加了建设社会主义的信心和力量。”乡互助合作委员会主任毛仁秋举出许多生动事例，说明韶山乡农民走社会主义道路的积极性是很高的，有力地批判了支部在领导合作化运动中的右倾思想。他说：“我们乡里在去冬今春建立了十三个农业社，入社户数占全乡总户数的百分之六十以上，当时我提心吊胆，生怕出岔子，就主张‘到此止步’。其实，迫切要求入社的农民越来越多，全乡十五个互助组已经有十四个组连续申请了四、五次，并且自愿组成了六个互助联组。贫农组员李谷环从春耕到现在，无数次要求入社，虽然一直没有批准，但是从来没有动摇过。可是我们自己的觉悟不高，正像主席说的，‘前怕龙，后怕虎’，顾虑合作社多了支部领导不了。照主席的报告来检查，我们不但没有积极的领导群众走社会主义道路，而且，还在把群众拉向后退。”会上，大家一致表示，要坚决照主席的指示办事，克服右倾思想，努力领导全乡农民朝着社会主义道路奋勇前进。
    十月十九日，韶山乡又召开了乡人民代表会议，同时又用开小会的办法进行学习；黑板报、大字报和广播筒也展开了宣传。这样广大农民对合作化的要求更加迫切了，社员们表示要努力把社办好，互助组争取要早日转社。不少贫农兴奋地说：我们知道毛主席是不会忘掉我们的，他答复了我们的入社要求。
    现在，毛主席故乡的农民，也和全国其他各地的农民一样，正以兴奋鼓舞的心情迎接合作化新高潮的到来。
