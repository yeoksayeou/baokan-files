　　Help Impoverished Farmers Outside the Cooperative Solve Difficulties and Improve Production
　　Editor:
　　Many impoverished farmers in Huanghua Township, Huanghua District, Changsha County, Hunan Province, are deeply grateful to the Xinghua Agricultural Production Cooperative for their help when they achieve a bumper harvest.
　　The Xinghua Agricultural Production Cooperative was established last winter. As soon as the cooperative was established, the cooperative committee paid attention to the problem of helping farmers outside the cooperative to improve production, and decided that Vice-Chairman Chen Qitai should be responsible for contacting farmers outside the cooperative. In each production stage, in addition to using their own exemplary actions in production to drive and influence farmers outside the cooperative, the cooperative members also helped impoverished farmers outside the cooperative solve many practical difficulties in production and life. For example, this spring, when it was almost time for transplanting rice seedlings, the Chen Yunqi mutual aid team nearby had no cattle for any of the nine team members, and more than 50 mu of paddy fields had not been plowed; the fields of Zhou Zhenwu, Auntie Yi, and other four individual farmers were also left with rice stubble facing the sky. Cooperative Chairman He Zhengwen and Vice-Chairman Chen Qitai were very concerned about this issue. Although the cooperative only had four cattle for more than 170 mu of fields, and time was tight, they decided after discussing with the cooperative committee members that the cooperative would use some manpower to harrow the fields and allocate some cattle to help farmers outside the cooperative plow the fields. At first, this matter was opposed by some cooperative members. Some members were worried that the cooperative's production would be affected, and some members were afraid that they would not be paid for helping impoverished farmers outside the cooperative plow the fields. The cooperative committee explained to everyone the important significance of agricultural production cooperatives helping farmers outside the cooperative to jointly improve production; and explained that if some households in difficulty could not afford cattle labor costs, they could use manual labor to exchange for cattle labor. After patient persuasion and education, the members all agreed to do so. When helping the Chen Yunqi mutual aid team plow the fields, in order to catch the season, the members using cattle worked regardless of whether it was sunny or rainy, and did the work very carefully. The three large fields of impoverished team member Shi Jinglong were always plowed unevenly in the past when contracted out to others, and after a few days without rain, one side would have water and the other side would crack; this year, the members plowed his fields flat. The soil in the fields of individual farmer Auntie Yi was too deep for the cattle to go down, so the members helped her turn it over with manpower, and later helped her transplant the seedlings in time. For example, in June and July this year, some farmers outside the cooperative did not have money to buy food and had great difficulties in life. At this time, after the cooperative harvested the early rice and delivered the grain purchased by the state in advance, the cooperative committee mobilized the members to save some grain and lend it to households outside the cooperative that lacked grain. When the cooperative learned that impoverished farmers Wang Bingdong, Su Jinhua, and others had not been able to borrow grain from wealthy middle peasants, they immediately took the initiative to lend it to them, helping them to smoothly overcome the summer famine.
　　After the autumn harvest, the early rice and middle rice of the Xinghua Agricultural Cooperative increased by more than 20% compared to last year, and the harvests of ordinary mutual aid teams and individual farmers nearby were also very good. When the news that the Xinghua Agricultural Cooperative was preparing to expand spread, the nearby farmers applied to join the cooperative one after another. Impoverished farmer Zhou Zhenwu has applied to the cooperative committee several times, saying, "I have seen the benefits of the agricultural cooperative and am determined to take the road of cooperativization."

### 帮助社外贫困农民解决困难搞好生产

　　帮助社外贫困农民解决困难搞好生产编辑同志：
    湖南长沙县黄花区黄花乡许多贫困农民在取得丰收的时候，都衷心感激兴华农业生产合作社对他们的帮助。
    兴华农业生产合作社是去年冬天建立起来的。社一成立，社务委员会就注意了帮助社外农民搞好生产的问题，并且确定由副社长陈其泰负责联系社外农民。在每一个生产阶段，社员们除了用自己积极搞好生产的模范行动来带动和影响社外农民以外，还帮助社外贫苦农民解决了不少生产和生活上的实际困难。例如，今年春天快要插秧的时候，附近的陈运其互助组因为九户组员谁也没有牛，还有五十多亩板田没有犁；周振武、易嫂子等四户单干农民的田也是禾蔸子朝天。社长何政文和副社长陈其泰很关心这个问题。虽然当时全社的一百七十多亩田只有四条牛，工夫也是很紧的；但是他们同社务委员们商量以后，还是决定社里用一部分人力耙田，抽出一部分牛力去帮助社外农民犁田。开始，这件事情遭到了一部分社员的反对，有的社员怕社里的生产会受影响，有的社员害怕帮助了社外困难农民犁了田得不到工钱。社务委员会就向大家说明农业生产合作社帮助社外农民共同搞好生产的重要意义；并且说明有些困难户如果出不起牛工钱，可以用人工换牛工的办法来解决。经过耐心的说服教育后，社员们都同意这样做。在帮助陈运其互助组犁田的时候，为了赶季节，用牛的社员不论天晴落雨都出工，并且把工夫做得很细致。贫农组员石景龙的三个大丘，往年包给别人犁，总是犁得一边高、一边低，几天不下雨，就变成一边有水、一边开坼；今年社员们把他的田犁得平平整整的。单干户易嫂子的田泥太深，牛不能下去，社员们便帮她用人力翻转来，后来还帮她及时插上了秧。又如，今年六、七月间，有些社外的农民没有钱买口粮，生活很困难。在这时候，社里收了早稻，在送交国家预购的粮食以后，社务委员会又动员社员节约一部分粮食借给社外的缺粮户。社里得知了贫农王炳东、粟金华等向富裕中农借谷没有借到，就马上主动借给他们，帮助他们顺利度过了夏荒。
    秋收结束后，兴华农业社的早稻和中稻比去年增产了百分之二十以上，附近一般互助组和个体农民的收成也都很好。当兴华农业社准备扩社的消息传出来以后，附近的农民纷纷要求入社。贫农周振武已经向社务委员会申请了好几次，他说：“我看到了农业社的好处，坚决要走合作化的道路。”
