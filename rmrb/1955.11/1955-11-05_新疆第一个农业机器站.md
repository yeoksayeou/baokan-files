Leaving Urumqi City to the west and travelling sixty li along the Peace Canal, you arrive at the Anning Canal District of Urumqi County. The center of this district is the site of the Anning Canal Agricultural Machine Station.

The Anning Canal Agricultural Machine Station was established in May 1954, and it was the first agricultural machine station established in Xinjiang. The station has tractors, grain combine harvesters, threshing machines, and a large number of new-style animal-powered farm implements, as well as a farm implement and machinery repair shop and an agricultural technology promotion group. Before the establishment of this agricultural machine station, the farmers of Han, Hui, Uyghur, Kazakh, Mongolian, Manchu, and Xibe ethnicities living here all used "two oxen pulling a plow" to cultivate the land, following ancient farming techniques. After liberation, although some farmers used some new-style animal-powered farm implements and learned some new farming techniques, it was only a beginning. After the establishment of this agricultural machine station, farmers in several nearby counties were very concerned. Last autumn, when the station's first tractor drove out to cultivate land for the Beida Road Agricultural Production Cooperative, not only did farmers in the district come to visit, but farmers more than a hundred li away also rode horses to see it.

Over the past year, this agricultural machine station has trained a group of tractor drivers, new-style animal-powered farm implement operators, repair workers, accountants, and other administrative personnel. In that boundless field, people can see the young Uyghur tractor driver Rehemu driving a tractor to plow the fertile land. Three years ago, he was just a farmer who only knew how to use a hoe; today, he is a skilled tractor driver and serves as the captain of the station's No. 3 tractor. In the golden wheat fields of the Huoxing Collective Farm, people can also see Ma Wenhua, who is only twenty years old, skillfully operating a grain combine harvester. Like Rehemu, he has only learned to drive a grain combine harvester in recent years. The station regularly holds various training classes, technology promotion networks, production seminars, and organizes visits to guide nearby farmers, training 633 new-style animal-powered farm implement operators and junior agricultural technicians, including Han, Hui, and Uyghur ethnicities, in the four counties of Urumqi, Miquan, Changji, and Qitai. Among this large group of newly trained personnel, many can independently operate animal-drawn self-propelled harvesters, seeders, cultivators, and other farm implements, and some can also perform simple repairs. Many young male and female members of agricultural production cooperatives have learned to operate new-style animal-powered farm implements. Like Lei Zhensheng, a young member of the Beida Road Agricultural Cooperative, after a short-term training at the station, he can now skillfully drive an animal-drawn self-propelled harvester to harvest wheat. The results of these efforts have greatly promoted the agricultural production increase movement centered on mutual aid and cooperation in Urumqi County, especially in the Anning Canal District.

Before the summer harvest of 1954, before the establishment of this agricultural machine station, Anning Canal only had one Huoxing Collective Farm and one Mengjin Farm's cultivated area. However, by the autumn harvest of this year, thirteen agricultural production cooperatives, one handicraft production cooperative, and a newly built Anning Farm had been established in the entire district.

Based on the rapid development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and with the help of the agricultural machine station, the farmers of all ethnic groups in the district used new-style farm implements, improved farming techniques, and the yield of various crops has also increased a lot. For example, winter wheat yielded an average of 174.6 jin per mu last year, and 207 jin this year; spring wheat yielded an average of 146.8 jin per mu last year, and 168 jin this year; rice yielded an average of 404 jin per mu last year, and 520 jin this year. Generally, the yields have increased by 15 to 25 percent compared to last year.

Now, the farmers in this district generally see the bright future of socialism and actively demand to join and establish cooperatives. Some temporary mutual aid teams are also actively working to improve production, improve systems, and strengthen unity to transform into permanent mutual aid teams and strive to transition into cooperatives as soon as possible. Many established agricultural cooperatives and permanent mutual aid teams planning to transition into cooperatives after the autumn harvest are actively leveling old field ridges and abandoned canals, leveling the ground, and expanding plots to better use agricultural machinery such as tractors, further develop production, and advance bravely on the road of socialism!

    新疆第一个农业机器站
    曾斌
    出乌鲁木齐市西郊，沿着和平渠行进六十里，就到了乌鲁木齐县安宁渠区。这个区的中心地带，就是安宁渠农业机器站的站址。
    安宁渠农业机器站是一九五四年五月建立的，它是新疆境内建立起来的第一个农业机器站。站内有拖拉机、谷物联合收割机、打粮机和一大批新式畜力农具，还有农具农机修理间和一个农业技术推广组。在这个农业机器站未建立以前，居住在这里的汉、回、维、哈、蒙、满、锡伯等族的农民，都是使用“二牛抬杠”耕地，沿袭着古老的耕作技术。解放后有些农民虽然使用了一部分新式畜力农具，学习了一些新的耕作技术，但是也仅仅是一个开始。这个农业机器站成立以后，附近好几个县内农民都很关心。去年秋天，当站内开出第一部拖拉机为北大路农业生产合作社耕地的时候，不仅区内农民赶来参观，百多里外的农民，也骑马赶来见识。
    一年多来，这个农业机器站培养出一批拖拉机手、新式畜力农具手、修理工、会计和其他行政人员。在那一望无际的田野里，人们可以看到年轻的维吾尔族拖拉机手热黑木驾驶拖拉机在那里翻耕肥沃的土地。三年前，他还是一个只会使用砍土镘的农民，今天，他已是一个熟练的拖拉机手，并且担任了站内三号拖拉机的车长；在火星集体农庄金黄的麦浪中，人们也可以看到仅仅二十岁的马文华，很熟练地驾驶着谷物联合收割机工作。他和热黑木一样，也是近年来才学会驾驶谷物联合收割机的。站内经常举办各种训练班、技术推广网、生产座谈会、组织参观等方式来指导附近的农民，在乌鲁木齐、米泉、昌吉、奇台四个县内，培养了六百三十三名包括汉、回、维等几个民族的新式畜力农具手和初级农业技术人员。在这一大批新培养出来的人员中，有好些已能单独操纵马拉自拨收割机、播种机、中耕器等农具，有的还能进行简单的修理工作。好些农业生产合作社年轻的男女社员，学会了操纵新式畜力农具。像北大路农业合作社年轻的社员雷振声经过站内短期的训练后，现在已能很熟练地驾驶马拉自拨收割机收割小麦。这些工作的结果，大大地促进了乌鲁木齐县，特别是安宁渠区以互助合作为中心的农业增产运动。
    一九五四年夏收以前，即这个农业机器站未建立以前，安宁渠仅有一个火星集体农庄，一个猛进农场的耕作区，可是到了今年秋收以前，全区就建立了十三个农业生产合作社，一个手工业生产合作社，另外还新建了一个安宁农场。
    区内各族农民，在互助合作运动迅速发展的基础上，由于农业机器站的帮助，使用了新式农具，改进了耕作技术，各种农作物的产量，也提高了很多。像冬麦，去年区内每亩平均收到一百七十四点六斤，今年收到二百零七斤；春麦去年每亩平均收到一百四十六点八斤，今年收到一百六十八斤；水稻去年每亩平均收到四百零四斤，今年收到五百二十斤。一般的都比去年提高百分之十五到二十五。
    现在，这个区内的农民，一般的都看清了社会主义的美满前途，积极地要求入社建社；一些临时互助组，也正积极地从搞好生产、健全制度、加强团结等方面入手，转为常年互助组，再争取早日转社；好些已建立起来的农业合作社和打算秋后转社的常年互助组，都主动地平掉老地埂和废渠，平整地面，扩大地块，以便更好地使用拖拉机等农业机器，进一步发展生产，在社会主义的大道上勇往前进！
