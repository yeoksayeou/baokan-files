　　The Slow “Pilot Project”
　　The “three fix” (fixed production, fixed purchase, fixed sales) grain quota work for a township generally only takes fifteen to twenty days to complete. However, the grain “three fix” pilot project in Eling Township, Chengguan District, Yinjiang County, Guizhou Province, has been going on for more than a month without any progress.
　　Why is the work progressing so slowly? This is because the work group leading the "three fix" work in this township suffered from blind complacency and poor working methods. Originally, the personnel of the work group saw that the meetings at the beginning of the work were very lively, and they thought that the work was almost done, so they became complacent and did not carry out in-depth ideological mobilization work afterwards. When they were investigating the production and consumption of grain, they did not closely rely on the Party branch, mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and activists, but instead a few people went to "摸底" ("touch the bottom") "single-handedly", which of course made it impossible to "touch" the real "bottom". For example, the staff responsible for leading the "three fix" work in the third electoral district did not know much about the surplus or deficiency of grain for all sixty-six households in the electoral district, except for three households. Once, this electoral district held a meeting overnight to evaluate the surplus or deficiency of grain, but only evaluated four households, and then could not evaluate any more, which made the activists from other electoral districts who came to learn experience return disappointed.
　　In this way, the work could no longer be carried out, and the Chengguan District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Yinjiang County had to re-arrange and arrange the "three fix" work in this township. It can be seen that if you are complacent as soon as you have made a little achievement, and are unwilling to carry out hard and meticulous work, the result will inevitably force you to spend more time and energy to start all over again!

　  迟缓的“试点”
    一个乡的粮食“三定”到户的工作，一般只要十五天到二十天就可以完成了，但是贵州省印江县城关区峨岭乡的粮食“三定”试点工作，搞了一个多月还没有头绪。
    为什么工作迟迟不进呢？这是因为在这个乡领导“三定”工作的工作组吃了盲目自满和工作方法不好的亏。原来工作组的人员看到工作开始的时候几个会开得很热烈，便以为工作做得差不多了，高兴得自满起来，以后也不再去进行深入的思想发动工作了。他们在调查粮食的生产和消费情况的时候，不是紧紧依靠党支部、互助合作组织和积极分子，而是几个人“匹马单枪”地去“摸底”，这当然不可能摸到真正的“底”。例如负责领导第三选区“三定”工作的工作人员，对全选区六十六户的粮食余缺情况，除了三户以外，都不大了解。有一次，这个选区开了一晚上的评议粮食余缺的会议，只评了四户，就再也评不下去了，使得别的选区来学习经验的积极分子都扫兴而归。
    这样，工作再也进行不下去了，中共印江县城关区委只好对这个乡的“三定”工作重新作了布置和安排。可见，工作刚刚作出一点成绩，便沾沾自喜，不肯再去进行艰苦细致的工作，结果工作必然要迫使你拿出更多的时间和精力去从头作起！
