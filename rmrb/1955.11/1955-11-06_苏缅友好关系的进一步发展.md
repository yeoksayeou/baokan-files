    Soviet Premier Nikolai Bulganin and Burmese Prime Minister U Nu issued a joint statement on the 3rd. The leaders of the two governments expressed the common desire of all peace-loving people to resolve the pressing international issues of the present through negotiation and consultation. The leaders of the two governments also expressed their intention to further consolidate the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Burma and strengthen economic and cultural cooperation between the two countries on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence.
    Thanks to the efforts made by governments and peoples of all countries to seek peace, the international situation has recently tended to ease, especially the Asian-African Conference held in Bandung in April this year and the Four-Power Summit Conference held in Geneva in July this year, which promoted the relaxation of international tension. This clearly shows that differences in political and social systems cannot become obstacles to international cooperation. The Soviet-Burmese joint statement expressed the hope that the foreign ministers' meeting currently being held in Geneva should make every effort to reach agreement on all issues stipulated in the instructions of the four heads of government, which is to require the foreign ministers to seek international peace with sincerity, mutual understanding, and respect for the interests of all parties concerned, and find ways to solve pressing international problems in the spirit of Geneva. This is also the urgent demand of millions of peace-loving people. If the four foreign ministers achieve positive results on the issues of European collective security and the unification of Germany, disarmament, and the development of East-West contact, it can further ease international tensions.
    The leaders of the two countries expressed great concern for peace in Asia and the Far East. The Soviet-Burmese joint statement pointed out that "special attention should be paid to the issues of Asia and the Far East at present" is entirely appropriate and timely.
    Since the Korean armistice and the restoration of peace in Indochina, the United States armed forces still occupy Taiwan, which is the main source of tension and unrest in the current Far East situation. The Soviet-Burmese joint statement justly pointed out that "the question of returning Taiwan and other islands, which have been Chinese territory since ancient times, to the Chinese people should be resolved," and that "the People's Republic of China should be granted the seat it is rightfully entitled to in the United Nations." This is a righteous declaration for the just position and demands of the Chinese people, and also a powerful support for safeguarding peace in Asia and international justice.
    In Indochina, the most pressing task at present is for the North and South Vietnamese authorities to hold free general elections in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Accords and achieve the reunification of Vietnam. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has repeatedly expressed its intention to faithfully continue implementing the Geneva Accords and has announced its readiness to consult with the Southern authorities on the issue of general elections. However, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, with the support of the United States, has not only refused to hold general elections to this day, but also held so-called "referendums" in an attempt to permanently divide Vietnam and completely undermine the Geneva Accords. In view of the serious situation in Vietnam, the Soviet-Burmese joint statement "demands that it be resolved without delay in accordance with the decisions of the 1954 Geneva Conference." This is a very timely and important call, and all countries responsible for implementing the Geneva Accords should earnestly fulfill their responsibilities, stop the Ngo Dinh Diem clique from undermining international agreements, and safeguard the interests of peace in Indochina.
    In the joint statement, the Soviet Premier and the Burmese Prime Minister determined that the principles of mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, peaceful coexistence, and economic cooperation should serve as the basis for consolidating and developing friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Burma. A sincere friendship has long been established between the Soviet people and the Burmese people. When the Burmese people finally achieved victory after a long struggle and declared Burmese independence on February 4, 1948, the Soviet Union immediately established friendly relations with Burma and recognized the independent sovereignty of the Union of Burma on January 18, 1948. Since then, the friendly relations between the Soviet people and the Burmese people have continued to grow. In particular, the joint efforts of the two governments and peoples in the struggle to ease international tensions have greatly enhanced the peaceful cooperative relations between the two countries. Economic and cultural ties between the Soviet Union and Burma have also been constantly expanding in recent years. Now, the Soviet-Burmese joint communique once again confirms the principles of peaceful coexistence as guidelines for guiding the relations between the two countries. It is not difficult to see that in the future, with the close cooperation between the two countries in international affairs, and with the expansion of economic, cultural, and scientific and technological cooperation between the two countries, the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Burma will achieve even greater development.
    The Chinese people warmly welcome the Soviet-Burmese joint statement and sincerely rejoice at the enhancement of the friendship between the two countries. The Chinese people believe that the further development of cooperation between the Soviet Union and Burma will be an important factor in consolidating peace in Asia and the world.

### 苏缅友好关系的进一步发展

    苏缅友好关系的进一步发展
    苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁和缅甸联邦总理吴努，在三日发表了联合声明。两国政府领袖表达了各国爱好和平人士的共同愿望，认为目前存在的迫切国际问题应该用谈判和协商的办法求得解决。两国政府领袖还表示要在和平共处的原则基础上，进一步巩固苏联和缅甸之间的友谊关系，加强两国之间的经济和文化合作。
    由于各国政府和人民谋求和平所作的努力，最近国际局势已趋向缓和，特别是今年四月在万隆举行的亚非会议和今年七月在日内瓦举行的四国政府首脑会议，推动了国际紧张局势的缓和。这就清楚地说明，政治制度和社会制度的不同，决不能成为进行国际合作的障碍。苏缅在联合声明中希望，目前在日内瓦举行的外长会议应竭尽一切努力，对四国政府首脑的指示所规定的一切问题达成协议，就是要求各国外长们本着“日内瓦精神”，互相谅解和尊重有关各方的利益，诚意谋求国际和平，找出解决迫切国际问题的途径来。这也是千百万爱好和平人民的迫切要求。四国外长如果在欧洲集体安全和统一德国问题、裁军问题和发展东西方接触问题取得积极结果，就可以使国际紧张局势进一步和缓下来。
    两国领袖对亚洲和远东和平表示了极大的关切。苏缅联合声明指出：“目前对亚洲和远东问题应当给予特别注意”，是完全恰合时宜的。
    自朝鲜停战和印度支那恢复和平后，美国武装力量依然霸占台湾，这是使目前远东局势紧张和不安的主要根源。苏缅联合声明公正地指出：“关于把自古以来就是中国领土的台湾和其他一些岛屿归还给中国人民的问题应当得到解决”，并应“给予中华人民共和国以它在联合国中有权应得的席位”。这是对中国人民的正义立场和要求的仗义执言，也是对维护亚洲和平与国际正义的有力支持。
    在印度支那，当前最迫切的任务，是由越南南北当局按照日内瓦协议的规定举行自由普选，实现越南全国的统一。越南民主共和国政府已多次表示要忠实继续执行日内瓦协议，曾宣布准备同南方当局协商普选问题。但是，吴庭艳集团在美国的支持下，不但至今拒绝普选，而且举行所谓“公民投票”，企图长期分裂越南，彻底破坏日内瓦协议。鉴于越南局势的严重情况，苏缅联合声明“要求刻不容缓地按照一九五四年日内瓦会议的决定加以解决”。这是非常及时而重要的呼吁，一切对执行日内瓦协议负有责任的国家，都应该切实负起责任来，制止吴庭艳集团破坏国际协议的行为，维护印度支那的和平利益。
    苏联部长会议主席和缅甸联邦总理在联合声明中，确定以互相尊重领土完整和主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处和经济合作诸原则，作为巩固和发展苏缅两国友好关系的基础。苏联人民和缅甸人民之间，早就建立了真挚的友好关系。当缅甸人民经过长期的斗争终于取得胜利，在一九四八年二月四日宣布缅甸独立的时候，苏联立刻同缅甸建立了友好关系，在一九四八年一月十八日承认了缅甸联邦的独立主权。以后苏联人民和缅甸人民间的友好关系不断增长。特别是两国政府和人民在缓和国际局势斗争中的共同努力，使两国间的和平合作关系有了很大的增进。苏联和缅甸之间的经济和文化联系，最近几年来也在不断扩大。现在，苏缅联合公报又确认和平共处的原则作为指导两国关系的准则。不难看出，今后随着两国在国际事务中的亲密合作，随着两国经济、文化和科学技术合作的扩大，苏缅两国间的友好关系将会得到更长足的发展。
    中国人民热烈欢迎苏缅联合声明，并对两国友谊的增进衷心地感到欣喜。中国人民认为，苏缅两国合作的进一步发展，将是巩固亚洲和世界和平的重要因素。
