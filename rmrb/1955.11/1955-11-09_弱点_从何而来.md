    Where Do "Weaknesses" Come From

    Reuters reporter Pridell and "New York Times" reporter Kalender recently sent telegrams from Geneva discussing the fragile position of the United States, Britain, and France on European security and the German issue, as well as the real motives behind their position.

    Pridell wrote on November 3 that the Soviet Foreign Minister exposed "a serious weakness in the West's plan for a European security system based on German unification" at the Foreign Ministers' meeting. This is: Western countries insist that a unified Germany "will have the right to choose to join the Western or Eastern alliance or remain neutral." However, the so-called "guarantees against aggression" given to the Soviet Union would only "take full effect after Germany is reunified and decides to join the Atlantic Treaty." This is clearly self-contradictory.

    Why do Western countries predetermine that a unified Germany must join the Western military bloc? From Kalender's telegram of November 3, it can be seen that this is because Western countries are not confident about what choice Germany will make after unification. He said: "Western commentators are unwilling to bet heavily that a reunified Germany will reject the neutrality favored by many in the Federal Republic of Germany and East Germany." In another telegram, Kalender admitted that, in fact, Western countries do not want Germany to be truly reunified. They know that "German unification is impossible under the conditions proposed by the West for it (referring to a unified Germany) to join the Atlantic Alliance." The real purpose of Western countries is to maintain the division of Germany, as long as they "can shift the responsibility to Moscow."

    Western countries are trying to put the cart before the horse by placing the issue of German unification above the issue of European security, and insisting on restoring German unification as a prerequisite for solving the European security issue. This strategy, to put it bluntly, is: to try to present themselves as defenders of German unification; if they can unify East Germany with the West and make the whole of Germany join the Western military bloc, that would be ideal; if that cannot be achieved, at least maintain the division of Germany, and then use this division as an excuse to delay the establishment of a European security system, while blaming the Soviet Union for the continued division of Germany and the unrest in Europe. But even Kalender and Pridell believe that this strategy of Western countries is clumsy. Kalender said: Western commentators "are reluctant to believe that there is no security when Germany is divided." Pridell is worried that Western countries have decorated their proposals too clumsily, and therefore cannot help but try to conceal their real intentions. He said: "Some observers believe that because Western countries have put forward their proposals clumsily, they have made themselves vulnerable to the accusation that it is they who are permanently dividing Germany because they are demanding too high a price for Russia to agree to German unification."

    The British reporter also pointed out: Molotov also exposed another weakness of the Western countries: "He asked what happened to Eden's proposal in July this year regarding mutual inspection of troops and weapons in a zone across the border between East and West Germany." This is a question that Western countries find difficult to answer. According to Kalender of the "New York Times," the reason why Western countries retreated from their past position is because now "some officials believe that British Prime Minister Eden's proposal to establish a somewhat demilitarized zone in Germany is a step towards a neutral Germany." Kalender said: Western countries are afraid that a unified Germany will remain neutral because "this will cause the West to lose important assets such as the Ruhr industrial area."

    The observations of these two Western reporters are nothing unique. However, they have revealed the real reasons for the many contradictions of Western countries at the Foreign Ministers' meeting. (Rui)

### “弱点”从何而来

    “弱点”从何而来
    路透社记者普里德尔和“纽约时报”记者卡伦德最近从日内瓦发出的电讯，谈到美、英、法三国在欧洲安全和德国问题上的脆弱立场以及它们这种立场背后的真实动机。
    普里德尔十一月三日写道，苏联外长在外长会议上揭破了“西方在提出以德国统一为基础的欧洲安全体系计划的时候的一个严重的弱点”。这就是：西方国家坚持说：统一后的德国“将有权选择参加西方或东方的联盟呢还是守中立”。但是，它们给予苏联的所谓“不受进攻的保证”却要“在德国重新统一和决定参加大西洋公约以后才完全生效。”这显然是自己打自己的嘴巴。
    为什么西方国家要预先规定统一后的德国一定得参加西方军事集团呢？从卡伦德十一月三日发出的电讯中可以看出，这是因为西方国家对于德国统一后作何抉择没有把握。他说：“西方评论家不愿意下很大赌注打赌一个重新统一的德国一定会拒绝德意志联邦共和国以及东德的许多人所赞同的中立。”在另一则电讯里，卡伦德承认，事实上西方国家并不希望德国真正能够恢复统一。它们明知“根据西方提出的它（指统一后的德国）参加大西洋联盟的条件实现德国的统一是不可能的”。西方国家的真正目的是保持德国分裂的局面，只要“能够把责任推在莫斯科身上”。
    西方国家竭力本末倒置地要把统一德国问题放在欧洲安全问题之上，坚持要以恢复德国统一作为解决欧洲安全问题的先决条件，这种策略拆穿了说就是：一定要把自己装扮成为德国统一的维护者，如果能够把东部德国也统一到西部，使整个德国加入西方军事集团，那再理想不过；如果这点达不到目的，至少保持德国的分裂，再以这一分裂为口实拖延建立欧洲安全体系，同时却可以把使德国继续分裂和欧洲的不安局面归咎于苏联。但是连卡伦德和普里德尔都认为，西方国家的这种策略是拙劣的。卡伦德说：西方评论员“都不愿相信当德国分裂的时候就没有安全”。普里德尔担心西方国家把自己的建议装饰得太不巧妙，因此不免欲盖弥彰。他说：“某些观察家认为，由于西方国家拙劣地提出了它们的建议，它们已使它们有遭受这样一种指责的可能：由于它们在要求俄国同意统一德国方面索价太高，所以使德国永久分裂的正是它们。”
    这位英国记者并且指出：莫洛托夫还揭破了西方国家的另外一个弱点：“他问艾登今年七月提出的关于在穿过德国的东西部边界上的一带地区互相视察军队和武器的建议的下落如何。”这是西方国家很难回答的一个问题。据“纽约时报”的卡伦德说，西方国家所以从过去的立场缩回去，是由于现在“某些官员认为，英国首相艾登主张在德国建立一个多少非军事化的地区的建议是走向中立德国的一个步骤”。卡伦德说：西方国家是害怕统一后的德国保持中立的，因为“这样将使西方失去像鲁尔工业区等重要的财产”。
    这两位西方记者的观察并没有什么独到之处。不过他们毕竟道出了西方国家在外长会议上矛盾百出的真正原因。　（瑞）
