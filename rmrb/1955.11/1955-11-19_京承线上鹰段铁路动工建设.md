Construction has begun on the Shangbancheng to Yingshouying section of the Beijing-Chengde Railway line. This section of the railway is planned to be completed in 1956. Key projects on the Yingshouying to Miyun section will also begin construction in 1956.

The Beijing-Chengde line runs from Beijing through Huairou, Miyun, Yingshouying and Shangbancheng near Chengde, connecting with the Chengde-Jinzhou Railway. Once the Beijing-Chengde line is completed, it will provide a second railway route from Beijing to the Northeast, in addition to the Beijing-Shenyang line. The Beijing-Chengde line originally had an old route, running from Beijing through Huairou, Miyun, Gubeikou to Chengde. This old route was largely destroyed before liberation. After liberation, the section between Beijing and Huairou has been repaired and opened to traffic, and the section between Huairou and Miyun has also been decided to be repaired. The section from Miyun through Gubeikou to Chengde will not be repaired because of its excessive slope and numerous curves. Instead, a new route has been selected from Miyun through Yingshouying to Shangbancheng to replace the old route. This route is more than 30 kilometers shorter than the old route and has greater economic value. (Xinhua News Agency)

　  京承线上鹰段铁路动工建设
    （北）京承（德）线铁路上板城到鹰手营段已经动工建设。这段铁路计划在一九五六年修通。鹰手营到密云段的重点工程也将在一九五六年施工。
    京承线从北京经怀柔、密云、鹰手营和承德附近的上板城到承德，和承（德）锦（州）铁路衔接。京承线修通以后，除了京沈线外，又将有第二条从北京通往东北的铁路。京承线原来曾有一条旧线，是从北京经怀柔、密云、古北口到承德。这条旧线在解放前大部遭到破坏。解放后北京到怀柔间已修复通车，怀柔到密云一段也决定修复。从密云经古北口到承德那一段，因为坡度太大，弯道多，所以决定不再修复，另外选定从密云经鹰手营到上板城一线代替旧线。这段线路比旧线短三十多公里，经济价值也比较大。　（据新华社讯）
