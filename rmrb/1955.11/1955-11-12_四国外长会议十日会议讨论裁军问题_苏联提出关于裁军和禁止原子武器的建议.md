Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, November 11th: The Foreign Ministers of France, Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States held their tenth meeting on the afternoon of November 10th. Macmillan chaired the meeting.

The Foreign Ministers began discussing the second item on the agenda—the issue of disarmament.

The head of the Soviet delegation, Molotov, spoke first. Molotov said that according to the instructions of the heads of the four governments, we are to "consider whether the four governments can proactively take any further useful actions in the area of disarmament."

He said that the Soviet Union's position on disarmament is not determined by any temporary speculative considerations, but by a consistent and principled struggle for peace and the security of all nations. The suggestions put forward by the Soviet government on May 10th of this year provide an appropriate basis for reaching an agreement between us, because we have actually reached consensus on several important issues. However, the progress of the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee meeting in New York shows that no further progress has been made. Moreover, according to the statements made by the US representative in the Disarmament Subcommittee and the statements of other members of the committee, things have even regressed somewhat. It is now possible to clearly record the consensus reached on the issue of the level of armed forces and on the order of measures to be implemented for the prohibition of atomic weapons.

Molotov pointed out that it is often mentioned now that technical difficulties supposedly hinder the implementation of effective supervision of the obligations of all countries to ban atomic weapons. He said that it cannot be denied that there are technical difficulties in establishing supervision over the observance of the obligation to ban atomic weapons, and therefore it takes time to study and explore appropriate technical measures. However, precisely because of this, it is of great significance in the current situation to morally and politically condemn the use of atomic weapons.

Molotov said that some people sometimes say that the solution to the disarmament problem should start with the solution to the supervision problem. This suggestion is in fact an attempt to replace the solution to the problem of ending the arms race with arguments about the various difficulties in establishing supervision, which will only indulge those who are keen on the arms race and military orders, and those who attempt to use the threat of atomic war to achieve their own goals.

Referring to Eisenhower's suggestion on mutual aerial photography and exchange of military intelligence between the Soviet Union and the United States, Molotov pointed out that we do not doubt that Eisenhower made his suggestion out of good intentions. However, this suggestion is separated from the issue of ending the arms race and is in fact unrelated to this task. This suggestion not only cannot promote trust between countries, but on the contrary will deepen mutual distrust. It cannot guarantee countries against sudden attacks because it does not stipulate the establishment of observation posts as suggested by the Soviet Union.

Molotov said that this does not mean that we have a negative attitude towards Eisenhower's suggestion in all cases. If the measures he suggested were closely linked to the task of reducing armaments and banning atomic weapons, then we might look at this suggestion in another way, considering aerial photography as one of the forms of supervision in the final stage of disarmament and banning atomic weapons.

Molotov also mentioned that French Prime Minister Faure's suggestion on limiting the military budgets of various countries should be treated with a positive attitude if considered in connection with the task of stopping the arms race. He said that British Prime Minister Eden's suggestion on taking certain measures in a certain region of Europe as part of the solution to the disarmament problem should also be carefully considered.

Molotov said that if we can record the consensus we have already reached in fact on some important issues and clearly declare that the issues on which we have not reached consensus must continue to be discussed, then this meeting will make a major contribution to the solution of the disarmament problem.

Molotov finally submitted the Soviet government's new suggestions to the meeting for discussion. (The full text of the suggestions will be issued separately.)

Dulles spoke next. He demanded acceptance of Eisenhower's suggestion. He also said that the establishment of observation posts suggested by the Soviet Union and agreed to by Eisenhower to prevent accidental attacks will strengthen preventive measures. However, this is only the first step, the beginning of the end of the arms expansion period and the beginning of the period of supervision of armaments.

Dulles said that he would study Molotov's speech at the tenth meeting in detail.

Dulles also stated that negotiations on the disarmament issue should continue in the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee. He said that the four foreign ministers can contribute to the achievements of the negotiations as long as they improve the atmosphere during the negotiations.

Pinay spoke next, advocating the adoption of Eisenhower's suggestion on exchanging military intelligence and aerial photography, as well as the Soviet Union's suggestion on establishing observation posts at key locations. He also mentioned Faure's suggestion.

Macmillan spoke next. He stated that it is difficult to conclude a universal disarmament agreement now. He said that attention should first be focused on achieving a relatively limited preliminary agreement in order to begin disarmament. The main purpose of this preliminary agreement should be to reduce armed forces and conventional armaments, and to supervise these measures. Macmillan believes that it would be beneficial to combine Eisenhower's suggestion on exchanging military intelligence and conducting aerial photography with Marshal Bulganin's suggestion on establishing observation posts at key locations.

Macmillan said that the British delegation will study today's Soviet suggestions very carefully. He finally submitted a draft of the Four-Nation Disarmament Declaration to the meeting for discussion.

The meeting adjourned at this point.

### 四国外长会议十日会议讨论裁军问题　苏联提出关于裁军和禁止原子武器的建议

　　四国外长会议十日会议讨论裁军问题
　　苏联提出关于裁军和禁止原子武器的建议
    新华社十一日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦十一日讯：法、英、苏、美四国外交部长十一月十日下午举行第十次会议。会议由麦克米伦担任主席。
    外交部长们开始讨论第二项议程——裁军问题。
    苏联代表团团长莫洛托夫第一个发言。莫洛托夫说，根据四国政府首脑指示，我们要“考虑四国政府是否能在裁军方面主动采取任何进一步的有用的行动”。
    他说，苏联在裁军问题上的立场不是由某种一时的投机性考虑决定的，而是由争取和平和各国人民安全的一贯的和原则性的斗争所决定的。苏联政府在今年五月十日提出的建议为在我们之间达成协议提供了适当的基础，因为我们在若干重要的问题上实际上已经取得了一致的意见。但是在纽约举行的联合国裁军小组委员会的会议进程表明，一直没有获得进一步的进展。而且根据美国代表在裁军小组委员会的声明以及这一委员会的其他委员的声明看来，事情甚至还有一些倒退。现在已经能把在武装部队水平问题上以及在禁止原子武器应当实行的措施的次序问题上所达成的一致意见明确地纪录下来。
    莫洛托夫指出，现在常常提到据说是阻碍着对各国禁止原子武器的义务的履行实行有效的监督的技术性困难。他说，不能否认，要对各国遵守禁止原子武器的义务建立监督是有技术上的困难的，因而需要时间来研究和探讨适当的技术措施。可是，正因为如此，在目前的情况下在道义上和政治上谴责使用原子武器就有非常重要的意义。
    莫洛托夫说，有人有时说，解决裁军问题应该从解决监督问题开始。这种建议在实际上就是企图用关于建立监督的各种困难的论调来代替结束军备竞赛问题的解决，而这样做只会放纵那些热衷于军备竞赛和军事订货的人、那些企图利用原子战争的威胁来达到自己的目的的人。
    莫洛托夫谈到艾森豪威尔关于苏联和美国之间相互进行空中摄影和交换军事情报的建议时指出，我们并不怀疑，艾森豪威尔在提出他的建议时是出于善良的意图。可是，这个建议同结束军备竞赛的问题分开了，而且事实上同这个任务毫无关系。这个建议不仅不能促进国与国之间的信任，而且相反地会加深相互的不信任。它不能保证各国不受突然袭击，因为它没有像苏联建议那样规定设立监察所。
    莫洛托夫说，这并不是说在一切情况下我们对艾森豪威尔的建议都抱否定态度。如果他所建议的措施是密切结合着裁减军备和禁止原子武器的任务，那末我们可能以另一种态度来看待这个建议，把空中摄影作为对裁军和禁止原子武器最后阶段进行监督的形式之一来考虑。
    莫洛托夫还提到，法国总理富尔关于限制各国军事预算的建议，如果同停止军备竞赛的任务联系起来考虑，是应该以积极态度来对待的。他说，英国首相艾登关于在欧洲某一地区采取某些措施作为裁军问题解决办法的一部分的建议，也应该给予仔细的考虑。
    莫洛托夫说，如果我们能把我们在一些重要问题上在事实上已经达成的一致意见纪录下来，并且明确地声明必须对我们还没有取得一致意见的问题继续加以讨论，那末，这次会议对解决裁军问题将会作出重大的贡献。
    莫洛托夫最后把苏联政府的新建议提交会议讨论。（建议全文另发）
    杜勒斯接着发言。他要求接受艾森豪威尔的建议。他又说，苏联所建议的、并且得到艾森豪威尔同意的防止意外袭击的监察所的设立将会加强预防的措施。但是，这只不过是第一步，是扩充军备时期结束的开始和对军备实行监督时期的开始。
    杜勒斯说，他将详细地研究莫洛托夫在十日会议上的发言。
    杜勒斯还表示关于裁军问题的谈判应当继续在联合国裁军小组委员会中进行。他说，四国外长只要使进行谈判时的气氛得到改善，就能够对谈判的成就作出贡献。
    比内接着发言，他主张通过艾森豪威尔的关于交换军事情报和关于空中摄影的建议，以及苏联的关于在枢纽地点建立监察所的建议。他也谈到富尔的建议。
    麦克米伦接着发言。他表示现在缔结一项普遍的裁军协定有困难。他说，应当首先集中注意力来取得比较有限的初步协定，以便开始裁军。这种初步协定的主要目的应当是裁减武装部队和常规军备，以及对这些措施实行监督。麦克米伦认为把艾森豪威尔关于交换军事情报和进行空中摄影的建议同布尔加宁元帅关于在枢纽地点设立监察所的建议合并起来会是有好处的。
    麦克米伦说，英国代表团将非常周密地研究今天的苏联建议。他最后把四国裁军宣言草案提交会议讨论。
    会议至此休会。
