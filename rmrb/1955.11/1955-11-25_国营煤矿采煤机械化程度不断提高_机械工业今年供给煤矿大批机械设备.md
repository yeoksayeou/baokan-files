Xinhua News Agency, November 24th: Over 45 percent of the coal produced by China's state-owned coal mines is now extracted using combined coal mining machines, coal cutting machines, or pneumatic picks. The remaining 50 percent is extracted by drilling holes with electric or pneumatic drills and then blasting. Backward tools such as hand picks, which were commonly used in many coal mines before liberation, have now almost disappeared. The degree of mechanization in transportation on underground work surfaces and in horizontal tunnels has also reached an average of over 80 percent.

Before liberation, there was not even one pneumatic pick in Chinese coal mines. Now, over 31 percent of state-owned coal mines across the country are using the latest Soviet-style combined coal mining machines to varying degrees. The number of coal cutting machines used is about six times the number of combined coal mining machines. The efficiency of these machines is constantly improving. In 1950, the average monthly output of each coal cutting machine was more than 3,200 tons, but now it has increased to an average of 7,500 tons, which is equivalent to the monthly output of more than 100 workers using hand picks. Electric locomotives and chain conveyors are even more widely used. In coal mines such as Datong, Yangquan, Fushun, and Jingxing, underground transportation workers have completely freed themselves from heavy manual labor and are using machinery for all coal transportation. In the coal mines of the Northwest region, where mechanization was implemented relatively late, new machines such as coal cutting machines and chain conveyors have also been added recently. In addition, in recent years, various coal mines have also purchased many ventilation machines to replace the original natural ventilation, so that coal miners who work underground all year round can ensure that they breathe more than three cubic meters of fresh air per minute.

With the improvement of the degree of mechanization in state-owned coal mines, the labor productivity of coal miners has also increased significantly. From January to September this year, each coal miner can mine more than three tons of coal every eight hours, more than twice as much as in 1950.

Xinhua News Agency: This year, state-owned coal mines have received more than 70 types of mining, transportation, and ventilation machinery, totaling more than 10,000 units, from various factories under the First Ministry of Machine Building and the three mining machinery factories in Caijiagang, Zhangjiakou, and Jixi. This number is several times higher than the number of machines supplied to coal mines by the national mechanical industry in 1952.

Because the mechanical industry is supplying an increasing number of machines to coal mines, the Ministry of Coal Industry has decided that in the future, most of the mechanical equipment needed by existing coal mines to improve their level of mechanization, and the complete sets of equipment needed by newly built mines with an annual output of less than 600,000 tons, will be supplied by domestic mechanical factories.

### 国营煤矿采煤机械化程度不断提高　机械工业今年供给煤矿大批机械设备

　　国营煤矿采煤机械化程度不断提高
　　机械工业今年供给煤矿大批机械设备
    据新华社二十四日讯　中国国营煤矿所生产的煤，现在已经有百分之四十五以上是用联合采煤机、截煤机或风镐开采出来的，其余的百分之五十以上也是用由电钻或风钻打眼然后放炮的方法开采出来的。解放前许多煤矿普遍使用的手镐等落后工具，现在已经几乎绝迹。井下工作面和平巷里的运输工作，机械化程度平均也达到百分之八十以上。
    解放前中国煤矿中连一部风镐也没有，现在全国百分之三十一以上的国营煤矿已经在不同程度上使用了苏联最新式的联合采煤机采煤。使用截煤机的数量约等于联合采煤机数量的六倍。这些机械的效率在不断地提高，一九五零年平均每部截煤机的月产量是三千二百多吨，现在平均已经提高到七千五百吨，相当于一百多个工人用手镐采煤的月产量。至于电机车和链板运输机等机械使用得更加普遍。在大同、阳泉、抚顺、井陉等煤矿里，井下的运输工人已经完全摆脱笨重的体力劳动，全部采用机械来运煤了。在机械化推行得比较迟的西北区煤矿，最近也添置了截煤机、链板运输机等新式机械。此外，几年来各煤矿还购置了许多通风机械以代替原来的自然通风，使常年在地下工作的煤矿工人能够保证每分钟呼吸到三立方公尺以上的新鲜空气。
    随着国营煤矿机械化程度的提高，煤矿工人的劳动生产率也有显著增长。今年一月到九月，每个采煤工人每八小时已能采出三吨多煤，比一九五零年时提高了两倍多。
    据新华社讯　今年国营煤矿从第一机械工业部所属各厂以及蔡家岗、张家口和鸡西三个矿山机械厂得到供应的各种类型的采掘、运输和通风机械，有七十多种，共计一万多台。这个数字超过了一九五二年全国机械工业供给煤矿机械数字的好几倍。
    由于机械工业供给煤矿机械日益增多，煤炭工业部已经决定今后凡是旧有煤矿为提高机械化水平所需要的机械设备，和年产六十万吨以下的新建矿井所需要的成套设备，大部分要由国内各机械厂供应。
