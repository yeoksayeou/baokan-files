The "cooperative frameworks" of seven cooperatives under construction in Qiancun Township, Shangyu County, Zhejiang Province, have already implemented unified production and collective labor in the process of establishing the cooperatives in order to avoid delaying production. However, because labor organizations had not yet been established, there were many people and matters were complex, and work lacked a clear direction. At the same time, because the crops growing in the fields were still managed by individual cooperative members, private production often conflicted with cooperative production. In some cooperatives, the cooperative director alone had to assign work and evaluate performance every day for the work of dozens of laborers, which went on until late at night. Some cooperative members said: Cooperatives are good, but staying up late is unbearable! Some cooperative members did not attend the work assignment meeting in the evening and had to start the next day empty-handed. Some cooperatives had no one to keep track of work points. When private farm work was slack, everyone rushed to do farm work for the cooperative; when private farm work was busy, everyone was reluctant to do farm work for the cooperative; the "cooperative framework" became an "empty framework." Under the guidance of the county party committee work team, the Qiancun Township branch led several "cooperative frameworks" to make preliminary arrangements for the current production of cooperatives and individual members, divided temporary production teams, and initially established production order. In this way, in the process of building the cooperatives, not only was the production of the cooperatives and private individuals improved, but also the confidence of the cooperative members in running the cooperatives well was enhanced.

    “社架子”要建立生产秩序
    为了力求不误生产，浙江省上虞县前村乡的七个正在建社的“社架子”，在建社过程中就已经实行了统一生产、集体劳动。但是，由于还没有建立劳动组织，人多事杂，干活没个头绪。同时，由于田里正长着的庄稼仍归社员个人经管，私人生产同社内生产常闹矛盾。有些社几十个劳动力的工作都要由社主任一人每天分派，每夜评分，弄到深更半夜。有些社员说：合作社好是好，就是熬夜吃不消！有的社员在晚上分工的时候没去开会，第二天就只好空起手来。有些社的工分也没人记账。私人的农活闲的时候，大家争着做社里的农活；私人的农活忙的时候，大家都不愿做社里的农活；“社架子”成了“空架子”。前村乡支部在县委工作组帮助下，领导几个“社架子”对当前合作社的和社员个人的生产作了初步安排，分了临时的生产小组，初步建立了生产秩序。这样，在建社过程中，不但把合作社的生产和私人的生产都搞好了，还提高了社员们把社办好的信心。
