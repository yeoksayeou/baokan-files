　　Since finishing the harvesting of early and mid-season rice and the transplanting of late rice seedlings, the Qianfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shengfeng Township, Huarong County, Hunan Province, has received more than 200 membership applications. Many people have applied again and again. Poor peasant Liu Bingzhao has applied four times already. He can't write, so each application was written for him. Hearing that the cooperative's expansion would be delayed for a while, he was anxious and restless. Later, he found Cai Xianjue, the director of the Qianfeng Agricultural Cooperative, and said bluntly, "Director Cai, in the old society, I worked as a long-term hired laborer for others for thirteen years. My class status and history are clear and clean, without any problems. Why won't you let me join the cooperative?" Many farmers outside the cooperative are creating conditions for themselves in every way to actively strive for membership. "When will the Qianfeng Agricultural Cooperative expand?" has become a common greeting among local farmers, replacing "How are you?"

　　Why is the Qianfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative so attractive to the local farmers?

　　The answer from the farmers of Shengfeng Township is: "Having seen the example of the Qianfeng Cooperative, there is no other good way to go but to join the cooperative!"

　　During the spring plowing and production fertilizer accumulation this year, the Qianfeng Cooperative applied more than 100 loads of fertilizer per mu on its 300-plus mu of paddy fields. Cooperative member Tang Sanbao's "Four-Dou Hill," which used to receive only 40 to 50 loads of fertilizer per mu and at most yielded only seven dan of grain, received 154 loads of fertilizer per mu after joining the cooperative. This year, it yielded twelve dan. People outside the cooperative said that Tang Sanbao's "Four-Dou Hill" had turned over after joining the cooperative. This year, there was no rain for more than fifty consecutive days in July and August. Most of the drained fields on Shengfeng Ridge ran out of water. The seedlings on Cai Baotang's two mu and one fen of land, which he farmed individually, dried up like upturned straw brushes. The Qianfeng Cooperative mobilized more than 40 men and women to work day and night, fetching water from the inner lake with seven turns of a waterwheel to irrigate the fields, preventing any damage to the more than 80 mu of grain. When agricultural work eased slightly after the completion of rice transplanting, the agricultural cooperative rationally arranged for sideline production, such as catching fish, gathering firewood, and planting lotus roots in the dikes, earning a total income of more than 400 yuan. What is most enviable is the fact that every household in the Qianfeng Agricultural Cooperative increased its production. The drought of more than fifty days in the summer caused many individual farmers and mutual aid team members in this semi-mountainous area to reduce their production. However, every one of the 32 households in the Qianfeng Cooperative increased their income. These events have made the farmers of Shengfeng Township clearly see the path they should choose.

　　Another reason why farmers outside the cooperative are eager to join the Qianfeng Cooperative is because the cooperative has a very deep friendship with them. The cooperative established a "Uniting the Masses Outside the Cooperative Group," with cooperative director Cai Xianjue as the leader. They often helped nearby mutual aid teams solve some difficult problems and introduced the cooperative's production experience. The cooperative absorbed the leaders of the surrounding mutual aid teams to participate in various production-related meetings. When harvesting early rice, mutual aid team leader Liu Yunchang participated in the cooperative's contracting meeting. After returning, he immediately convened a team members' meeting, matching labor according to skill level and implementing contracting by plot, reducing the trouble of daily work evaluation and labor allocation. When Cai Songting's mutual aid team was short of farm tools during the busy spring plowing season, and the work was very urgent with nowhere to borrow them, the cooperative took out a set of plows and harrows that they were using and lent them to them, solving this difficult problem. The story of the agricultural cooperative helping Wang Shuangyu to water his rice fields is well known throughout Shengfeng Ridge: Wang Shuangyu had one mu and eight fen of land on Shengfeng Ridge, right next to the Qianfeng Agricultural Cooperative's fields. This year, during the drought, the last layer of water in his field was about to dry up, and the ponds and dikes were parched. Seeing that the mid-season rice, which was budding and flowering, was in danger of drying up, Wang Shuangyu was so anxious that he lost his composure. He met Director Cai of the Qianfeng Cooperative and wanted to talk about his concerns, but he thought, "At this time, no one can take care of anyone else; there's no use telling anyone." The next day, he went listlessly to the ridge to look at the rice seedlings that were about to die, and he was greatly surprised: the field was full of water, and the green rice seedlings were gently swaying in the southern wind. He immediately understood: the water was released from the agricultural cooperative's fields; only the agricultural cooperative would help others in this way. This water was irrigated into his field after Director Cai and the cooperative members discussed it; the water was taken from the inner lake and pumped seven turns to reach the mountain. This is how the Qianfeng Cooperative enthusiastically helps farmers outside the cooperative, tightly uniting them around it.

　　After the completion of the profit distribution work, the Qianfeng Agricultural Cooperative has accepted 43 new members. It is like a bright red flag, fluttering on Shengfeng Ridge, guiding the farmers of the whole township to advance towards socialist society on the road of cooperativization!

　　胜峰岭上的一面红旗—前锋农业合作社
　　彭绍善
    自从割完早、中稻，插罢晚秧后，湖南省华容县胜峰乡前锋农业生产合作社就收到两百多份入社申请书，很多人申请了一次又一次。贫农刘丙照已经申请过四次了，他不会写字，每次申请书都是请人代写的，听说合作社扩社要等个时期，急得行坐不安。后来，他找着前锋农业合作社的主任蔡先觉，劈头就说：“蔡主任，旧社会我帮人家做了十三年长工，成份历史清清白白、没有半点问题，为什么不让我入社？”很多社外农民从各个方面给自己创造条件，积极争取入社。“前锋农业合作社几时扩社？”成为当地农民见面时代替问好、招呼的话了。
    前锋农业生产合作社为什么能够这样地吸引当地的农民呢？
    胜峰乡农民的回答是：“看了前锋社的榜样，除了入社，再没第二条路好走！”
    今年春耕生产积肥的时候，前锋社三百多亩水田，每亩积肥一百多担，社员唐三保的“四斗丘”，往年每亩只施四、五十担肥料，最多只收过七担谷。入社后每亩施了一百五十四担肥料，今年收了十二担，社外群众说：唐三保入社后，“四斗丘”翻身了。今年七、八月份接连五十多天没有下雨，胜峰岭上的排田，大部分断了水脚，单干农民蔡保堂的二亩一分丘的禾苗，干得像朝天刷把。前锋社出动了男女四十多人日夜抢救，从内湖翻七转车，车湖水上岭灌田，八十多亩粒谷未受半点损伤。农业社在插秧结束农事稍闲的时候，合理安排了农副业生产，捕鱼、打木柴、在堰里栽藕，共收入了四百多元。最使人羡慕的，还是前锋农业社户户增产这个事实。入夏五十多天的干旱，在这半山地带，使许多个体农民和互助组员减产，但是，前锋社三十二户社员家家增加了收入。这些事迹使得胜峰乡的农民看清了自己应该选择的道路。
    社外农民迫切要求加入前锋社的另一个原因，是因为社同他们有着十分深厚的友情。社里成立了一个“团结社外群众小组”，社主任蔡先觉担任组长，经常帮助附近互助组解决一些疑难问题、介绍社里的生产经验，社里开有关生产的各种会议都吸收周围互助组长参加。收割早稻的时候，互助组长刘云昌参加了合作社的包工会，回去后立即召开组员会，把劳力按技术强弱搭配，实行分丘块包工，减少了每日评工计分和排工的麻烦。蔡松庭互助组春耕生产紧张时缺农具，眼看工夫十分紧张，没处可借，社里把正在使用的犁耙抽出一套主动借给他们，解决了这一困难问题。农业合作社帮王双玉车水救禾的故事，在胜峰岭一带是人人全知道的：王双玉有一亩八分田在胜峰岭上，紧贴着前锋农业社的田，今年干旱的时候田里最后的一层水也快干了，塘堰已枯焦焦地，眼看正在抽穗扬花的中稻断水无救了，王双玉焦急得失去了主意，他遇着前锋社蔡主任，本想要把心事谈谈，但是他又想，这时候谁也顾不得谁；说给谁听也帮不了忙。次日，他没精打采地到岭上去看那快要干死的禾苗，不禁大吃一惊：田里满满一丘水，青葱的禾苗正轻微地在南风中摆动着。他马上明白了：是农业合作社田里放来的水；只有农业合作社才会这样帮助别人。这水是蔡主任和社员们商量后灌到他田里去的，水是从内湖车了七转才车到山上来的。前锋社就是这样去热情帮助社外农民，把社外农民紧紧地团结在它的周围。
    前锋农业合作社在收益分配工作结束后，已接收了四十三户新社员入社。它像一面光辉灿烂的红旗，飘扬在胜峰岭上，引导着全乡农民在合作化道路上向社会主义社会前进！
