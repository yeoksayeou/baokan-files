Yunnan Province has made great progress in farmers' spare-time cultural education. According to statistics from eighty-two cities and counties including Kunming, Yuxi, Mojiang, Baoshan, Changning, and Jingdong, more than 120,400 farmers are currently enrolled in winter schools and year-round people's schools. All counties have generally convened meetings of people's school teachers this year and have opened training classes for people's school teachers to train them. This year, there are 4,673 teachers in people's schools and winter schools, of which 4,013 teachers have studied in people's teacher training classes.

In the winter schools and year-round people's schools in various places, more than 40% of the rural staff have participated in the study, and the number of enrolled students has increased significantly compared to the past. In Xiaobaiyi Village of the Yi Autonomous Region in Eshan County, 100% of the rural staff have enrolled in studies.

In order to improve the quality of teaching in winter schools and people's schools, tutoring stations have been set up in Jinning, Mojiang, Zhaotong, Dali, and other places. Elementary school teachers participate in tutoring work without hindering their professional work, helping people's school teachers solve problems in teaching. The people's school teacher in Xiaobaiyi Village of the Yi Autonomous Region in Eshan County, based on the situation that rural staff have high mobility and cannot attend collective studies on time, adopted the card learning method, writing new characters on square cardboard and distributing them to students who go to county and district meetings or cannot participate in studies for other reasons, so that students can review new characters in their spare time.

This year, many agricultural producers' cooperatives have established people's schools, enrolling young and middle-aged illiterate people from cooperative members and active elements outside the cooperative. In order to run the people's schools well, many agricultural producers' cooperatives have included the discussion of people's school work on the agenda of the cooperative affairs committee and have reasonably arranged production and study time. Cooperative cadres are the backbone of cultural learning, and cooperative production teams are study groups, which can study culture anytime and anywhere in the fields, before and after meetings, so as to ensure that production and study are not delayed.

　  云南发展农民业余文化教育
    云南省农民业余文化教育工作有很大发展。据昆明、玉溪、墨江、保山、昌宁、景东等八十二个市县统计，目前有十二万零四百多个农民进入冬学和常年民校学习。各县今年普遍召开了民校教师会议，开办民师训练班，培养民校教师。今年民校和冬学的教师有四千六百七十三名，其中四千零十三名教师在民师训练班学习过。
    在各地的冬学和常年民校中，乡村工作人员有百分之四十以上参加了学习，入学人数比过去增加很多。在峨山县彝族自治区小白邑村的乡村工作人员百分之百地入学学习。
    为了提高冬学和民校的教学质量，晋宁、墨江、昭通、大理等地设立了辅导站，由小学校的教师在不妨碍业务的情况下参加辅导工作，帮助民校教师解决教学中的问题。峨山县彝族自治区小白邑村的民校教师，根据乡村工作人员流动大不能按时参加集体学习等情况，采用了卡片学习的方法，在方块的硬纸板上写上生字，发给去县、区开会和因其他原因不能参加学习的学员，使学员能在空隙时间复习生字。
    今年有许多农业生产合作社办了民校，吸收了合作社社员和社外积极分子中的青壮年文盲入学。为了办好民校，许多农业生产合作社把讨论民校工作列入社务委员会的日程，并合理地安排了生产和学习时间。合作社干部是学习文化的骨干，合作社生产组就是学习小组，可以随时在田边地头、会前会后学习文化，做到生产、学习两不误。
