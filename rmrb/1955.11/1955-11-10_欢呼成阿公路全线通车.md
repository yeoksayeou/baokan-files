    Cheers for the Full Completion of the Chengdu-Aba Highway
    By Hua'ergong Chenglie, Vice Chairman of the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Sichuan Province
    The Chengdu-Aba Highway, which runs through the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Sichuan Province, was fully opened to traffic on November 10th. The 400,000 Tibetan, Qiang, Hui, Han, and other ethnic groups in our autonomous region are extremely excited and warmly congratulate the successful completion of the Chengdu-Aba Highway.
    Since the Chengdu-Aba Highway began to open to traffic section by section, the long-standing isolation of northwestern Sichuan from the outside world has begun to change, and the remote northwestern Sichuan region has begun to connect with the interior of the motherland. We have extremely favorable and convenient conditions to receive strong assistance from the Han people in the interior of the motherland. The political, economic, and cultural development of the autonomous region will also be greatly enhanced. Now, along the highway, many places that were barren a few years ago have built new cities like Shuajing Temple with thousands of people, as well as many new market towns and farms. In the past, agricultural production in northwestern Sichuan was very backward, and there was no industry at all. Now, thanks to the opening of the highway, many machines have been transported from the interior of the motherland. We will use these machines to equip the power plants that have been built or are about to be built, the iron factories that will manufacture various iron farm tools, the bone meal factories that will produce fertilizer, and the local product processing factories. The rich local specialties of the autonomous region will be transported to all parts of the country. Industrial products produced in various parts of the country will also be transported to the autonomous region in large quantities. The lives of all ethnic groups will be substantially improved as a result. Undoubtedly, the full opening of the Chengdu-Aba Highway will greatly promote the political, economic, and cultural development of the autonomous region, and the unity between us and the Han people in the interior will be further consolidated.
    When celebrating the full opening of the Chengdu-Aba Highway, we should first thank the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the laborers, and the cadres who participated in the construction of the road. Because of their high degree of patriotism and internationalism, they overcame all difficulties and finally built the road through dangerous canyons, across cold mountains, and over marshy grasslands. In this heroic undertaking, some people even sacrificed their precious lives. We pay our highest respects to the heroes and martyrs who built the road. Our 400,000 people of all ethnic groups will always remember the great price paid by the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Han people to help our ethnic minorities, and will always remember their immortal achievements.
    While we are rejoicing and celebrating the full opening of the Chengdu-Aba Highway, we cannot help but recall the desolate and backward appearance of northwestern Sichuan under the reactionary rule before liberation and the tragic lives of the people of all ethnic groups. From the construction of the Chengdu-Aba Highway and the tremendous changes it has brought to northwestern Sichuan, we have once again deeply realized that only in the great family of the people's democratic motherland can we receive equal treatment and sincere and selfless assistance; only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao can we, the people of ethnic minorities, escape from misery and move towards a path of eternal prosperity and happiness.

    欢呼成阿公路全线通车
    四川省藏族自治区副主席　华尔功成烈
    贯穿在四川省藏族自治区境内的成（都）阿（坝）公路，在十一月十日全线通车。我们自治区内四十万藏、羌、回、汉等各族人民，以非常兴奋的心情，热烈地祝贺成阿公路的修筑成功。
    自从成阿公路开始逐段通车以来，川西北历来和外界隔绝的状况开始改变了，偏僻的川西北地区开始和祖国内地联系起来了。我们有了极为有利和方便的条件，得到祖国内地汉族人民对我们的大力帮助。自治区内的政治、经济、文化也将有更大的发展。现在，沿公路线的地方，许多几年前还是一片荒凉的地方，已建筑起了像刷经寺这样拥有数千人口的新城市及许多新集镇和农场。过去的川西北连农业生产都很落后，根本没有什么工业；而现在，由于公路的通车，已经从祖国内地运来了许多机器，我们将用这些机器来装备已经建设或即将建设的发电厂、打造各种铁质农具的铁工厂、生产肥料的骨粉厂和土产加工厂。自治区的丰富的土特产品将运往祖国各地。祖国各地出产的工业用品也将大量运进自治区。各族人民的生活将因此得到切实的改善。无疑的，成阿公路全线通车以后，将使自治区的政治、经济、文化得到更大的发展，我们和内地汉族人民的团结，将会更加巩固。
    庆祝成阿公路全线通车的时候，我们首先应该感谢参加筑路的中国人民解放军和民工、干部们。由于他们具有高度的爱国主义和国际主义精神，排除万难，终于把公路修过险恶的峡谷，修过严寒的山岭和泥沼的草地。在这个英雄的事业中，有的人还献出了自己的宝贵的生命。我们谨向筑路的英雄们、烈士们致以崇高的敬意。我们四十万各族人民，将永远记着中国人民解放军和汉族人民，为帮助我们少数民族所付出的巨大代价，将永远记着他们建立的不朽功勋。
    我们为成阿公路的全线通车而欢欣鼓舞的时候，也不能不回想到解放前，在反动统治下的川西北的荒凉、落后的面貌和各族人民所过的悲惨生活。从成阿公路的建成及它给川西北带来的巨大变化中，我们又一次深刻地体会到：只有在伟大的人民民主的祖国大家庭中，才能得到平等的待遇和真诚无私的帮助；只有在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，我们少数民族人民才能脱离苦境，走向永远繁荣和幸福的道路。
