Achievements of Yugoslav Industrial Construction
　　Chen Wei
　　The laboring people of all nationalities in Yugoslavia are celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia, and are proudly looking back at the tremendous achievements they have made in developing their economy and culture over the past decade. Thanks to the enthusiastic labor of the Yugoslav working class since liberation, Yugoslavia's industry has developed greatly. Yugoslavia, which was one of the most economically backward countries in Europe, is now rapidly transforming into an industrial nation.
　　Yugoslavia possesses very rich natural resources. Its mineral deposits are not only large but also diverse. Yugoslavia is one of the largest producers of barium, antimony, and lead. It ranks second in the world in the production of mercury, zinc, and copper. It is estimated that Yugoslavia's iron ore reserves are about 200 million tons, coal reserves are about 13.4 billion tons, crude oil reserves are over 20 million tons, and oil shale has an oil content of 350 million tons. In terms of hydropower resources, Yugoslavia ranks second in Europe only to Norway and Italy, excluding the Soviet Union. If fully utilized, the electricity generated annually would be sufficient to supply a country with a population of 160 million.
　　However, due to the long-term plunder by foreign monopoly capital and the rule of the domestic landlord-bourgeoisie before liberation, Yugoslavia's rich resources were not developed and utilized to serve the interests of the Yugoslav people. For a long time, Yugoslavia's economy remained at a low, semi-colonial level, and it was basically a backward agricultural country, with farmers accounting for three-quarters of the national population. Before the war, foreign capital held more than half of the total industrial investment in Yugoslavia. They almost completely controlled Yugoslavia's copper mines, lead-zinc mines, the entire metallurgical industry, the textile industry, and most of the other industries.
　　Before the war, most of Yugoslavia's industry was engaged in raw material production and agricultural product processing. The foundation of heavy industry was very weak, the technological level of industry was also very low, and most industrial enterprises were small enterprises lacking modern equipment.
　　The occupation by the fascist German invaders and the devastation of the war caused significant damage to Yugoslavia's already weak foundation. Some mines were destroyed, the rest were damaged, and more than half of the industrial enterprises suffered severe damage. This situation created enormous difficulties for the post-war recovery and construction work of the Yugoslav people.
　　But the Yugoslav people, with their heroic fighting tradition and rigorous training in the anti-fascist war, did not bow their heads in the face of difficulties. They immediately threw themselves into the upsurge of building a new life and struggled to restore the economy and change the backwardness of the country. As a result of the nationalization of industry in 1945, the economic lifeline of the country was grasped by the people. The public ownership of basic means of production paved the way for Yugoslavia's economic development. After industrial and agricultural production recovered to pre-war levels in 1947, the Yugoslav people began to tackle the major tasks facing them, namely, further developing the national economy and realizing the country's industrialization. The National Assembly of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia passed the first Five-Year Plan (1947-1951) for the development of the national economy in 1947. The goals set by this plan were: "To eliminate economic and technological backwardness, consolidate the country's economic and defense strength, consolidate and further develop the socialist components and new production relations in the national economy, and improve the common welfare of the working people."
　　After the first Five-Year Plan, Yugoslavia continued to implement the policy of industrialization. In the last four years, 75 to 91 percent of Yugoslavia's total investment has been in industrial construction. As more than 250 new industrial enterprises have been put into production during the post-war period, many new and important industrial sectors have been established, and industrial production has more than doubled compared to pre-war levels.
　　The machinery manufacturing industry, as the heart of industry, has achieved particularly enormous development. Before the war, the scale of Yugoslavia's machinery manufacturing industry was very small, with an annual output of only 3,500 tons. Now, the annual output of this important industrial sector has reached 300,000 tons. It is capable of manufacturing various products, including trucks, tractors, construction machinery, mining machinery, power generation equipment, and electrical appliances. Yugoslavia's shipbuilding industry can now build seagoing vessels with a displacement of 10,000 tons and oil tankers with a displacement of 18,000 tons.
　　Not only has industrial production increased significantly, but the scale and technological level of industrial enterprises have also greatly expanded and improved. Before the war, Yugoslavia had 200 metallurgical factories, but they were all small factories with backward technology and low labor productivity. Now, the "Zenica" metallurgical complex in Bosnia and Herzegovina alone far exceeds the total capacity of the pre-war metallurgical industry. It has 11,000 workers and a designed capacity of 800,000 tons of pig iron and 700,000 tons of steel per year. The "May 1st" machine tool factory in Zagreb, Republic of Croatia, was only a small mechanical repair shop before the war. Now it has developed into Yugoslavia's largest machine tool factory, capable of producing universal lathes, milling machines, drilling machines, planers, and various other machine tools. Today, the number of workers working in Yugoslavia's industry, transportation, and construction sectors has increased from 300,000 before the war to 1,275,000 last year. And more than 60 percent of all workers are concentrated in large factories and enterprises with more than 500 workers.
　　The development of industry has raised previously economically backward regions to the level of advanced regions and established relatively developed industries. The industrial output of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which was formerly the most economically backward region, has increased by nearly two times compared to pre-war levels. Now it produces 6 million tons of coal, equivalent to about 40 percent of Yugoslavia's total coal production. After all engineering construction is completed, its pig iron production will increase tenfold, and its steel production will increase by seven and a half times. The industry of Montenegro and Macedonia has also developed rapidly. The former's industrial output has increased by two and a half times compared to pre-war levels, and the latter's has increased by nearly three and a half times. The electricity production of these two republics has developed particularly rapidly. Macedonia's electricity production has increased sixteenfold compared to pre-war levels. The largest hydropower station in Yugoslavia is being built on the Zeta River in Montenegro, which will generate nearly 2 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually after completion.
　　Industry has now become the most important source of national income in Yugoslavia, accounting for 42.1 percent of the total national income, exceeding the proportion of agriculture, and the production of means of production accounts for two-thirds of the entire industry. This year, Yugoslavia's industry will have further growth, reaching 240 percent of pre-war levels.
　　The Yugoslav people have already achieved significant achievements in developing industry. But they still face difficulties today in striving for the country's socialist industrialization. Because the basic industry has developed too quickly, the processing industry, consumer goods industry, and agriculture have not been developed accordingly, resulting in disconnections in the economy. Recently, an economic policy conference was held under the chairmanship of President Tito, which determined a new economic policy aimed at eliminating the disparity in economic development, ensuring the proportional development of all sectors of the economy, balancing revenue and expenditure, and further improving the people's living standards.
　　The large foreign debt accumulated in the past few years and the huge trade deficit with Western countries are also a burden on Yugoslavia's economy. Yugoslavia needs to use a quarter of the foreign exchange earned from exports each year to repay its foreign debt to Western countries. In order to improve this situation, Yugoslavia is striving to expand exports and develop international economic relations.
　　Developing trade relations with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for sovereignty will help promote mutual economic development and friendly cooperation. The trade agreement signed between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union in January of this year has been implemented very smoothly, and the volume of barter between the two sides has actually increased by about double what the agreement stipulates. The economic talks held between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia in Moscow in September of this year reached a consensus on further developing trade relations and carrying out economic and technological cooperation between the two sides. The Soviet Union also decided to provide Yugoslavia with preferential credit loans for Yugoslavia to build some industrial enterprises and for other uses. Yugoslavia has also signed trade agreements with the People's Democratic countries in Europe, mutually supplying each other with needed materials. The development of this friendly economic cooperative relationship is undoubtedly beneficial to the further development of Yugoslavia's industry.
　　The tremendous achievements Yugoslavia has made in all aspects of construction in the ten years since liberation, coupled with the friendly relations it has developed with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, have created favorable conditions for Yugoslavia to further develop its economy.

　　南斯拉夫工业建设的成就
　　陈维
    南斯拉夫各族劳动人民，欢庆南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国成立十周年，并以自豪的心情来回顾他们十年来在发展经济和文化事业中所取得的巨大成就。由于南斯拉夫工人阶级在解放以后的热情劳动，南斯拉夫的工业已经有了很大的发展。本来是欧洲经济最落后的国家之一的南斯拉夫，现在正在迅速地转变为一个工业国家。
    南斯拉夫拥有十分丰富的自然资源。它的矿产不但蕴量很大而且种类繁多。南斯拉夫是产钡、锑、铅最多的国家之一。它在汞、锌和铜的产量方面位居世界第二。据估计，南斯拉夫的铁矿藏约有二亿吨，煤矿藏约有一百三十四亿吨，原油蕴藏量在二千万吨以上，油母页岩的含油量有三亿五千万吨。在水力资源方面，除苏联外，南斯拉夫在欧洲仅次于挪威和意大利。如果全部加以利用，每年发出的电力足可供应一个一亿六千万人口的国家的需要。
    但是，由于解放前长期遭受外国垄断资本的掠夺和本国地主—资产阶级的统治，南斯拉夫的丰富资源并没有被开发和利用来为南斯拉夫人民的利益服务。南斯拉夫的经济长时期来处于半殖民地的低下水平，基本上是一个落后的农业国，农民占全国人口的四分之三。外国资本战前握有南斯拉夫全国工业投资的一半以上。它们几乎控制着南斯拉夫的铜矿、铅—锌矿的全部，冶金工业，纺织工业以及其他工业的大部分。
    战前南斯拉夫的大部分工业都是从事原料生产和农产品加工的。重工业的基础非常薄弱，工业的技术水平也很低下，工业企业中大部分都是缺乏现代化设备的小型企业。
    法西斯德国侵略者的占领和战争的破坏，曾使南斯拉夫本来就很薄弱的一点基础遭到了重大的摧残。全国矿坑部分被毁，其余的遭到破坏，一半多的工业企业受到严重的损坏。这种情形给战后的南斯拉夫人民的恢复和建设工作造成了巨大的困难。
    但是在具有英勇的战斗传统和经历了反法西斯战争的严格锻炼的南斯拉夫人民，并没有在困难面前低头。他们立即投入了建设新生活的热潮，为恢复经济和改变国家的落后面貌而斗争。一九四五年实行工业国有化的结果，国家的经济命脉掌握到了人民的手里。基本生产资料的公有制为南斯拉夫的经济发展开辟了道路。一九四七年工农业生产恢复到了战前水平以后，南斯拉夫人民就开始着手解决他们所面临的重大任务，即进一步发展国民经济并实现国家的工业化。南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国国民议会在一九四七年通过了发展国民经济的第一个五年（一九四七—一九五一年）计划。这个计划规定的目标是：“消除经济和技术的落后性，巩固国家的经济力量和国防力量，巩固和进一步发展国民经济中的社会主义成分和新的生产关系，并提高劳动人民的共同福利。”
    在第一个五年计划以后，南斯拉夫继续实行着工业化的方针。在最近四年内，南斯拉夫全部投资的百分之七十五到九十一是投在工业建设中的。由于在战后期间二百五十多个新的工业企业单位投入生产，许多新的重要的工业部门已经建立起来，工业生产量比战前增加了一倍以上。
    作为工业心脏的机器制造业获得了特别巨大的发展。战前南斯拉夫机器制造业的规模是很小的，每年的产品只有三千五百吨，现在这个重要工业部门的年产量已达到三十万吨。它能够制造包括载重汽车、拖拉机、建筑机械、采矿机械、发电设备和电气用品在内的各种产品。南斯拉夫的造船工业已能建造排水量达一万吨的航海船只和一万八千吨的油船。
    不仅工业生产量有了很大的增长，而且工业企业的规模和技术水平也大大扩大和提高了。战前南斯拉夫虽有二百个冶金工厂，却都是技术落后、劳动生产率很低的小型工厂，现在，一个波斯尼亚—黑塞哥维纳的“泽尼查”冶金联合企业就远远超过战前冶金工业的总能力，它拥有一万一千工人，设计能力达到年产生铁八十万吨和钢七十万吨。克罗地亚共和国萨格勒布的“五一”机床制造工厂在战前只是一个小小的机械修理厂，现在已发展成为南斯拉夫最大的机床工厂，能够生产万能镟床、铣床、钻床、刨床和其他各种机床。今天在南斯拉夫的工业、运输业和建筑业中工作的工人数量，已从战前的三十万人增加到去年的一百二十七万五千人。而全部工人的百分之六十以上集中在拥有五百个工人以上的大工厂企业中。
    工业的发展把原来经济落后的地区提高到了先进地区的水平，建立了比较发达的工业。从前经济上最落后的波斯尼亚—黑塞哥维纳的工业产量已比战前增加了近两倍。现在这里生产着六百万吨煤，等于南斯拉夫全国煤产量的百分之四十左右。在全部工程建筑完成以后，这里的生铁产量将增加十倍，钢增加七倍半。门的内哥罗和马其顿的工业也发展得很快。前者工业产量比战前增加二倍半，后者增加近三倍半。这两个共和国的电力生产发展得特别迅速。马其顿的电力产量比战前提高了十六倍。在门的内哥罗的杰塔河上正在建设着南斯拉夫最大的水电站，建成以后每年将发出近二十亿瓩时的电力。
    工业现在已成为南斯拉夫国民收入的最重要的来源，它在全部国民收入中的比重达到百分之四十二点一，超过了农业所占的比重，而生产资料的生产在整个工业中的比重占三分之二。今年，南斯拉夫的工业将有进一步的增长，而达到战前水平的百分
  之二百四十。
    南斯拉夫人民在发展工业方面已经取得了重大的成就。但是他们今天在争取国家社会主义工业化的道路上仍然有着困难。由于基本工业发展太快，加工工业、消费品工业和农业等未得到相应的发展，产生了经济中的脱节。不久前在铁托总统主持下举行了经济政策会议，确定了新的经济政策，目的在消除经济发展中的悬殊现象，保证整个经济各部门成比例的发展，平衡收支和进一步提高人民的生活水平。
    过去几年里积累起来的很大的外债和对西方国家贸易上的巨大逆差，也是南斯拉夫经济上的一个负担。南斯拉夫每年需要以出口所得的外汇的四分之一来偿付对西方国家的外债。为了改善这种情况，南斯拉夫正在努力扩大出口，发展国际经济关系。
    在平等互利和互相尊重主权的基础上发展同苏联和各人民民主国家的贸易关系，有助于促进彼此的经济发展与友好合作。今年一月南斯拉夫同苏联签订的贸易协定执行得十分顺利，双方的换货量实际上已比协定所规定的增加了一倍左右。今年九月苏联同南斯拉夫在莫斯科举行的经济会谈，就进一步发展双方的贸易关系和进行经济技术合作取得了一致的意见。苏联并决定对南斯拉夫提供优惠的信用贷款，以供南斯拉夫兴建一些工业企业和作其他使用。南斯拉夫同欧洲各人民民主国家也签订了贸易协定，相互供应着各自所需的物资。这种友好的经济合作关系的发展对南斯拉夫工业的进一步发展无疑是有利的。
    南斯拉夫解放十年来在各方面建设中所取得的巨大成就，加上它同苏联和人民民主国家间发展的友好关系，已为南斯拉夫进一步发展它的经济创造了良好的条件。
