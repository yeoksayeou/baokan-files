Actively and Systematically Carry Out the Agricultural Cooperation Movement
Carry Out the Agricultural Cooperation Movement in Minority Areas
Lin Gang

In the vast agricultural areas inhabited by minority nationalities in our country, the socialist mass movement is developing rapidly. Having obtained land, the people of all ethnic groups strongly demand to develop production and move towards prosperity together through the road of mutual aid and cooperation.

Organizing agricultural cooperatives has become the focus of public opinion among the masses of farmers of all ethnic groups. Permanent mutual aid teams are generally considering the transition to cooperatives. Ordinary poor farmers are also spontaneously visiting cooperatives to inquire about the situation of running them, going in groups to register at the district level and applying to join the cooperatives. In Xinjiang, mutual aid teams planning to establish cooperatives are sowing winter wheat, purchasing livestock and new agricultural tools in a unified manner, and self-selecting accountants, making various preparations for establishing cooperatives. As long as the leadership "gives the word" (i.e., agrees), the cooperatives can be set up. In areas such as Yunnan and Guizhou, farmers are going to counties and districts to request cadres to help establish cooperatives; mutual aid teams are merging into joint teams, collectively reclaiming wasteland, buying oxen, buying waterwheels, and building small-scale water conservancy projects in preparation for transitioning to cooperatives. Farmers in Huili County, Sichuan Province, in order to establish cooperatives, jointly went to the agricultural cooperative in Xichang County, 200 kilometers away, to learn about cooperative management experience. In the Bose area of Guangxi, many minority farmers scattered in the mountains are voluntarily moving down the mountains to request to join cooperatives. In Hekou Village, Minhe County, Qinghai Province, there are twenty-five peasant households, eight of which had been enemies for generations and did not interact with each other; this time, for fear that the transition to cooperatives would not be approved, they voluntarily held a meeting to self-criticize, put their fingerprints on, and signed a peace agreement, forming a large mutual aid team and requesting to transition to a cooperative.

Before July this year, plans in various places were generally conservative, and the leadership lagged behind the masses. Guizhou Province had reduced its plan to establish 18,000 cooperatives this year to 10,000. In Mutual Aid County (now Mutual Aid Tu Autonomous County) in Qinghai Province, after communicating the General Line, eighty-one mutual aid teams (600 households) requested to establish cooperatives, but the county party committee only approved two (22 households). Some Party leading organs in minority areas also put forward various restrictions such as "three no-nos" (no cooperatives will be established if not within the planned number, no cooperatives will be established without a foundation of permanent mutual aid teams, no cooperatives will be established without the approval of the county party committee), "two no-entries" (those with land but no labor cannot join, those with labor but no land cannot join), and "no more than two cooperatives in one village," etc. However, the peasants did not stop moving forward. They questioned the leaders, saying, "Chairman Mao is guiding us to take the socialist road, why don't you want us to take it?" "Do you want us to turn the permanent teams into teams for ten thousand years?" Well-run "spontaneous cooperatives" also appeared everywhere. In the semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral area of ​​Zhelimu League in Inner Mongolia, more than 300 cooperatives were formed, self-described by peasants as "joint planting groups," and "agriculture-pastoral combination groups." In the Tacheng area of ​​Xinjiang, many "mutual aid teams" also emerged that featured "land without compensation, unified management, and distribution according to work."

The reasons for the leadership lagging behind the masses in the cooperative movement in minority agricultural areas are: excessive emphasis on the complexity of ethnic relations and the backwardness of the economy and culture in ethnic areas, while failing to see the essential and mainstream aspects. Since the liberation of the whole country, tremendous changes have taken place in the situation of minority areas in our country. The unity and friendship among all ethnic groups have been unprecedentedly consolidated and developed. The Communist Party and Chairman Mao have extremely high prestige among the people of all ethnic groups. Democratic reform and land reform have been completed in most areas. However, the peasants who have been allotted land are generally still poor or not well-off due to lack of means of production and means of subsistence. They are not satisfied with the status quo. The propaganda of the General Line and the development of the national agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement have greatly encouraged their socialist enthusiasm. The people of all ethnic groups are eagerly demanding to develop production along the road of mutual aid and cooperation and further improve their lives. Party organizations at all levels in minority areas have been established successively and are gradually being improved.

Based on the above aspects, the agricultural cooperation movement is developing. In Inner Mongolia, agricultural cooperatives have developed to more than 6,900, with the number of peasant households joining the cooperatives accounting for 17% of the total number of peasant households. In Xinjiang, from last autumn to this spring plowing, agricultural cooperatives have developed from 147 to 1,702. Not a single cooperative has collapsed. The number of households withdrawing from the cooperatives is less than two per thousand. Ninety-five percent of the cooperatives have achieved increased production. Only 3% have maintained the level before the establishment of the cooperatives. Two percent of the cooperatives have reduced production due to disasters. The Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region implemented the policy of relying on party branches and establishing cooperatives in every township, and the number of cooperatives has developed to more than 2,700. This summer, 87% of them achieved increased production. Almost every township in the former Xikang Province has cooperatives. The number of cooperatives in Gansu has increased tenfold in two years, and there are now 7,151 cooperatives, none of which have collapsed, and 93% of them have increased production compared with mutual aid teams. The 24 cooperatives piloted in the mountainous areas of the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture have all increased production this year. The facts powerfully prove that cooperatives can be established in minority agricultural areas, and they can be established in large numbers and well. The Party organizations in minority areas are fully capable of leading the people of all ethnic groups to gradually move towards socialism.

The ethnic relations in minority areas are indeed very complicated. It is completely right to take into account this special situation. However, we must recognize that in the new historical period, the unity of the people of all ethnic groups can be thoroughly consolidated only on the basis of gradually realizing socialist industrialization and socialist transformation, and constantly developing the political, economic, and cultural aspects of the people of all ethnic groups. The facts of the past few years have also proved that where the mutual aid and cooperation movement has been carried out well, the backwardness has been greatly changed, and the unity of nationalities has been more consolidated. In some semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia, Mongolian herdsmen and Han farmers often had disputes due to production contradictions because farmlands and pastures were intertwined. After the establishment of "agriculture-pastoral cooperatives," the Mongolian and Han people reasonably planned and used farmland and pastures in a planned manner based on common interests, and reasonably divided labor, turning agricultural-pastoral contradictions into agricultural-pastoral mutual assistance. Crops grew well, livestock fattened, and ethnic disputes were fundamentally eliminated. In some areas in Qinghai and Gansu provinces, where the historical gap between the Hui and Han nationalities was deep, large numbers of Hui-Han joint cooperatives have now been established. In the process of working together in labor and production, the mutual suspicion between the Hui and Han people has been eliminated.

In the Duyun area of ​​Guizhou Province, there were two kinds of guiding ideologies and two kinds of practices on the issue of establishing cooperatives, which produced two kinds of results. In four counties inhabited by border ethnic groups, the leaders emphasized the complexity of ethnic relations and the incompleteness of land reform, and spent years dealing with the remaining issues of land reform and resolving ethnic disputes, delaying mutual aid and cooperation. However, there were always many problems, and the enemy could even raise the banner of nationality to openly fight against us. The promotion of various tasks was extremely slow. In the seven ethnic minority inhabited or mixed counties in the west, after the land reform, the mutual aid and cooperation movement was launched immediately. Before autumn this year, the number of peasant households participating in cooperatives had reached more than 30%. Farmers of all ethnic groups united in production, celebrated together, and the remaining issues of land reform were also solved incidentally in the agricultural cooperation movement. Has any serious problem arisen in ethnic relations because of the development of cooperatives? No. The facts in Guizhou, Gansu, and other provinces have also proved that the reactionary "emperors" did not appear in places where the cooperative movement developed, but precisely in those places where people worried about the complexity of ethnic relations, were hesitant and dared not let go and mobilize the masses to establish cooperatives.

It is also a fact that the politics, economy, and culture of minority areas are generally backward. But the question is: are we to actively lead the people of all ethnic groups to advance along the socialist road so that they can forever get rid of poverty and backwardness? Or are we to allow the people of all ethnic groups to remain in a state of poverty and backwardness for a long time, which is actually developing along the capitalist road?

In poor and backward minority areas, the proportion of poor and non-wealthy farmers is generally greater, and these farmers are actively demanding to implement mutual aid and cooperation and carry out the socialist transformation of agriculture. The poor peasant backbone in the land reform undertook the task of leading the socialist transformation. Minority areas generally have vast land and sparse population, backward production methods, simple production tools, extensive farming techniques, and many natural disasters. Therefore, historically, they have been characterized by extensive planting and low yields. But precisely because of this, the land has greater potential. Once cooperatives are established, the increase in production is particularly prominent, and it is easier to show the superiority of cooperation. Farmers of all ethnic groups see that only cooperation can reclaim wasteland in large quantities, expand cultivated land area, build small-scale water conservancy projects, prevent and control natural disasters, improve farming techniques, and greatly increase production. Therefore, their enthusiasm for taking the road of cooperation is very high.

It can be seen from this that the Party's agricultural cooperation policy can be fully implemented in minority areas. Naturally, with the arrival of the upsurge of rural socialism, the class struggle is becoming increasingly acute, and there are still many difficulties in carrying out cooperation in minority areas. However, as long as we go deep into the masses of farmers of all ethnic groups, work hard and meticulously, and correctly combine the Party's agricultural cooperation policy with the actual conditions of ethnic areas, we can ensure the sound development of the movement.

"Prudence and Steadiness" is our guiding principle for carrying out all work in minority areas. We must also adhere to this guiding principle in carrying out the agricultural cooperation movement. In the past, some areas simply understood "prudence and steadiness" as "take it slow," which actually turned into "steadiness without progress," thus seriously deviating from the masses. This is wrong. To correctly implement the principle of "prudence and steadiness" requires us to specifically investigate and analyze the political, economic, and cultural development of our ethnic areas, correctly estimate the level of socialist consciousness of the people of all ethnic groups, make overall plans, and establish cooperatives in batches, in stages, and in sections in a planned and guided manner. To correctly implement the principle of "prudence and steadiness" requires us to ensure that the principle of "voluntary joining and freedom to withdraw" is resolutely implemented in the establishment of cooperatives. As the Yao and Zhuang farmers in Pingguo County, Guangxi, said, joining the cooperative must be "willing in word, willing in heart, willing in the whole family, and willing between ethnic groups." Correctly implementing the principle of "prudence and steadiness" means combining "proactiveness" and "prudence" and fully taking into account the unevenness of various aspects of development in minority areas. In areas where land reform has been completed, the mutual aid and cooperation movement has a certain foundation, and the party branch has experience in running cooperatives, we should boldly develop the agricultural cooperation movement. In areas where democratic reform and land reform have been completed later and the foundation of the mutual aid and cooperation movement is poor, it is generally said that we should prepare to spend a longer time to complete the agricultural cooperation. Only the most backward border areas still need to wait for a long time. But they should all actively create conditions for the realization of the socialist transformation of agriculture, and should not wait passively.

Due to the ethnic estrangement caused by history that has not been completely eliminated, due to the differences in production habits, farming techniques, customs, religious beliefs, and languages ​​and characters of various ethnic groups, it is necessary to fully take into account the characteristics of the ethnic groups when establishing cooperatives in ethnic areas. It is necessary to do a good job in the united front work of ethnic and religious upper-class figures, educate them to support the cause of socialist transformation of agriculture, and strive for broader social forces to sympathize with and support the agricultural cooperation movement. It is necessary to strengthen the education of ethnic unity in the process of establishing cooperatives. All ethnic groups are equal within the cooperative. Ensure that the people of all ethnic groups respect and help each other. Advocate that more advanced ethnic groups actively help more backward ethnic groups, and that ethnic groups with larger populations help ethnic groups with smaller populations. In agricultural cooperatives jointly formed by several ethnic groups, it is necessary to ensure that poor peasants account for the majority of the leading members, and also to take into account that various ethnic groups maintain an appropriate proportion of cadres in the cooperative. Regulations within the cooperative, team formation, division of labor, and allocation of tasks must take into account the different customs and labor and production habits of different ethnic groups.

Doing a good job in the preparation work before the establishment of cooperatives and the consolidation work after the establishment of cooperatives has special significance in minority areas. One of the main preparatory tasks for establishing cooperatives is to develop party organizations and train local ethnic cadres. In minority agricultural areas, if there are not a certain number of party organizations and party members playing a fortress role, and if there are not a large number of activists from all ethnic groups who support the Communist Party and the agricultural cooperation policy, the cooperatives cannot be run well, and the great development of the cooperative movement is impossible. However, it is wrong to think that cooperatives cannot be established at all if the party's foundation is weak. Among the 1,378 cooperatives in the former Xikang Province, 94% of the cooperatives had only more than 3,400 party members, with an average of only two and a half party members per cooperative, but the vast majority of the cooperatives were run very well; the other 6% of the cooperatives had no party members at all, and they were not run badly or collapsed. On the contrary, because the movement was launched, the Party was able to absorb the outstanding elements with socialist consciousness who emerged in the movement into its ranks, and continuously strengthen the Party's strength. Cadres must also be trained in the struggle. In the past few years, various places have trained a group of local ethnic cadres who have played a major role in contacting the masses, implementing the Party's policies, and mobilizing the masses of farmers of all ethnic groups to participate in the mutual aid and cooperation movement. This achievement should be carried forward and consolidated. In the future agricultural cooperation movement, it is especially necessary to be good at discovering the ethnic activists with socialist consciousness, fairness, and contact with the masses, and form the core of running cooperatives. Boldly promote them to leading positions. Improve their policy level and cooperative management capabilities by constantly summing up experience. We must always remember Stalin's teaching: to help minority nationalities "walk on their own feet."

The upsurge of the agricultural cooperation movement is also coming to minority areas! We should overcome all difficulties and resolutely, enthusiastically, and unhesitatingly lead the people of all ethnic groups to advance along the socialist road.

    积极地有计划地开展农业合作化运动
    开展少数民族地区的农业合作化运动
    林钢
    在我国广大的少数民族农业地区，社会主义的群众运动正在迅速发展。获得了土地的各族农民，强烈地要求通过互助合作的道路，发展生产，共同走向富裕。
    组织农业合作社已经成为各族农民群众的舆论中心。常年互助组普遍在酝酿转社。一般贫苦农民，也纷纷自动参观合作社，打听办社情况，成群结队地到区里报名挂号，申请入社。在新疆，打算建社的互助组，成批成批地统一播种冬麦，购买牲口和新式农具，自选会计，作好各种建社准备，只要领导“给个话”（即同意），合作社就能办起来。云南、贵州等地的农民群众，到县、区要求派干部帮助建社；互助组纷纷并成联组，集体开荒，买耕牛，买水车，兴修小型水利，准备转社。四川省会理县农民为了建社，合伙到二百公里外的西昌县农业合作社去学习办社经验。在广西百色地区，不少散居在山上的少数民族农民，自动搬下山来，要求入社。青海省民和县河口村有二十五户农民，其中八户是几世的冤家，谁也不理谁；这次为了怕转社批不准，就自动开会检讨，按手印，立了和约，并成一个大互助组，要求转社。
    今年七月以前，各地计划一般都偏于保守，领导落在群众的后面。贵州省曾将今年建社一万八千个的计划，缩减为一万个。青海省互助县（现已改为互助土族自治县）在传达总路线后有八十一个互助组（六百户）要求建社，县委只批准两个（二十二户）。有些少数民族地区党的领导机关还提出了“三不办”（不在计划数内不办，没有常年互助组的基础不办、不经县委批准不办）、“二不入”（有土地没有劳动力不能入，有劳动力没有土地也不能入）、“一村不建二社”等种种限制。但是农民并未停止前进。他们责问领导说：“毛主席引导我们走社会主义的路，你们为什么不要我们走？”“你们是不是要让我们把常年组变成万年组？”办得很好的“自发社”也到处出现了。在内蒙古哲里木盟半农半牧地区，还出现了三百多个农民自称为“伙种伙分组”、“农牧结合组”的合作社；在新疆塔城地区，“土地不要报酬、统一经营、按劳分配”的“互助组”也出现不少。
    少数民族农业地区在合作化运动方面领导落后于群众的原因是：过份强调了民族关系的复杂情况和民族地区经济和文化的落后性，而看不到本质的和主流的方面。全国解放以来，我国各少数民族地区的形势已经发生了巨大的变化。各民族间的团结和友谊空前地巩固和发展了。共产党和毛主席在各族人民中有了极高的威信。绝大部分地区完成了民主改革和土地改革。但是，分得了土地的农民，由于缺乏生产资料和生活资料，生活一般还是贫困或不富裕的。他们不满足于现状。总路线的宣传和全国农业互助合作运动的发展，大大鼓舞了他们的社会主义热情。各族农民迫切地要求沿着互助合作的道路发展生产，进一步改善生活。少数民族地区党的各级组织已经相继建立并且正在逐步健全起来。
    在上述各方面的基础上，农业合作化运动正在发展。内蒙古的农业合作社已经发展到六千九百多个，入社农户占到总农户数的百分之十七。新疆从去年秋后到今年春耕，农业合作社由一百四十七个发展到了一千七百零二个，没有发现一个社垮台，退社户不到千分之二，有百分之九十五的社获得增产，只有百分之三保持建社前的水平，百分之二的社因灾害而减产。桂西僮族自治区贯彻执行了依靠支部、乡乡办社的方针，合作社已经发展到二千七百多个，今年夏收，百分之八十七获得增产。原西康省差不多已乡乡有社。甘肃的合作社在两年内增加了十倍，现有七千一百五十一个社，没有一个垮台，百分之九十三比互助组增产。海南黎族苗族自治州在山区试办的二十四个社，今年社社增产。事实有力地证明了，在少数民族农业地区是能够办社，也能够多办和办好的。少数民族地区的党组织是完全能够领导各族农民逐步走向社会主义的。
    少数民族地区的民族关系，的确很复杂。照顾到这个特殊情况是完全应该的。但是，我们必须认识，在新的历史时期，各族人民间的团结，只有在逐步实现社会主义工业化和社会主义改造，不断发展各族人民政治、经济和文化的基础上，才能彻底巩固。几年来的事实也证明，那里的互助合作运动开展得好，那里的落后面貌就大大改变，那里的民族团结也就更为巩固。在内蒙古有些半农半牧区，由于农田牧场互相交错，蒙族牧民和汉族农民常常因为生产上的矛盾而引起纠纷。建立了“农牧合作社”以后，蒙汉两族人民根据共同的利益，对农田和牧场进行了合理规划和有计划使用，劳动也进行了合理分工，就使农牧矛盾变成了农牧互助，庄稼长好了，牲畜膘满了，民族纠纷也根本消除了。青海、甘肃等省有些历史上回汉隔阂较深的地区，现在大批大批地建立了回汉联合合作社。在共同携手进行劳动生产中，回汉人民的相互猜疑心理消除了。
    贵州省都匀地区在办社问题上有两种指导思想，两种作法，产生了两种结果。在四个边沿民族聚居县，领导方面强调民族关系复杂，土地改革不彻底，便用整年整年的时间处理土地改革遗留问题，解决民族纠纷，推迟互助合作。可是问题总是很多，敌人甚至可以打起民族旗帜公开来同我们进行斗争，各项工作的推行都极为缓慢。西部七个民族聚居或杂居县，在土地改革之后，紧接着开展了互助合作运动。到今年秋前，参加合作社的农户已达到百分之三十以上。各族农民团结生产，喜庆联欢，土地改革遗留的问题也在农业合作化运动中捎带解决了。有没有因为合作社发展而在民族关系方面发生严重问题的呢？并没有。贵州、甘肃等省的事实也证明了，反革命的“皇上”不是出在合作化运动发展的地方，而恰恰是出在那些忧虑民族关系复杂，缩手缩脚，不敢放手发动群众办社的地方。
    少数民族地区政治、经济、文化一般比较落后，也是事实。但是问题正在于：我们是积极领导各族农民沿着社会主义道路前进，使他们永远摆脱贫困落后呢？还是听任各族农民长期停留在贫困落后的状态，而实际上是沿着资本主义道路发展呢？
    在贫困落后的少数民族地区，贫苦和不富裕的农民一般占的比重更大，这些农民都积极要求实行互助合作，实行农业的社会主义改造。土地改革中的贫农骨干，就担负起了领导社会主义改造的任务。少数民族地区一般地广人稀、生产方式落后、生产工具简单、耕作技术粗放、自然灾害多，因此历史上都是广种薄收。但是正因为这样，土地潜力较大，办起合作社来，增产就特别突出，更容易显示合作化的优越性。各族农民看到，只有合作化才能大量开荒，扩大耕地面积，兴修小型水利，防治自然灾害，改进耕作技术，大大增产。所以他们走合作化道路的热情很高。
    由此可见，党的农业合作化政策，在少数民族地区是完全可以实行的。自然，随着农村社会主义高潮的到来，阶级斗争日趋尖锐，在少数民族地区搞合作化，困难还是很多的。但是，只要我们深入各族农民群众，艰苦细致地工作，把党的农业合作化政策同民族地区的实际情况正确地结合起来，是能够保证运动健全发展的。
    “慎重稳进”是我们在少数民族地区进行一切工作的方针。开展农业合作化运动也必须坚持这一方针。过去有些地区把“慎重稳进”简单地理解为“慢慢来”，实际上变成了“稳而不进”，因而严重脱离了群众，这是错误的。正确执行“慎重稳进”的方针，要求我们具体调查和分析本民族地区的政治、经济、文化的发展状况，正确估计各族人民的社会主义觉悟水平，作好全面规划，分批、分期、分段，有计划有领导地建立合作社。正确执行“慎重稳进”的方针，要求我们在建社中保证坚决执行“入社自愿，退社自由”的原则。正如广西平果县瑶族、僮族农民所说，入社要“口愿、心愿、全家愿、民族间相互愿”。正确执行“慎重稳进”的方针，就是要把“积极”和“慎重”结合起来，并充分照顾到少数民族地区各方面发展的不平衡性。在土地改革已经完成，互助合作运动有了一定基础，支部已有办社经验的地区，就应当大胆放手发展农业合作化运动；在那些民主改革和土地改革完成得较晚，互助合作运动基础较差的地区，一般地说，就应当准备用较长的时间来完成农业的合作化。只有那些最落后的边疆地区，还须长期等待。但是它们都应当积极为实现农业的社会主义改造创造条件，不应当消极等待。
    由于历史上造成的民族隔阂尚未完全消除，由于各民族生产习惯、耕作技术、风俗习惯、宗教信仰及语言文字的不同，在民族地区建社就必须充分照顾到民族特点。要做好民族、宗教上层人物的统一战线工作，教育他们拥护农业的社会主义改造事业，争取更广泛的社会力量同情和支持农业合作化运动。在建社过程中要加强民族团结的教育。社内各民族一律平等。使各族农民互相尊重、互相帮助。提倡比较先进的民族主动帮助比较落后的民族，人数多的帮助人数少的民族。在由几个民族联合组成的农业合作社里，既要保证贫农在领导成员中占多数，又要照顾到各族在社内干部中保持适当的比例。规定社内制度，编队编组，分工分业，必须照顾到不同民族的不同风俗习惯和劳动生产习惯。
    认真做好建社以前的准备工作和建社以后的整顿巩固工作，在少数民族地区有特殊重要的意义。建社主要准备工作之一是发展党的组织和培养本地民族干部。在少数民族农业地区，如果没有一定数量的党组织和党员起堡垒作用，如果没有大批拥护共产党和农业合作化政策的各族农民积极分子，合作社是办不好的，合作化运动的大发展是不可能的。但是，如果认为党的基础薄弱，就绝对不能办社，那就错了。原西康省的一千三百七十八个合作社中，百分之九十四的合作社里只有三千四百多名党员，平均每社只有二个半党员，但是绝大多数合作社办得很好；另外百分之六的合作社根本没有党员，也没有办坏，办垮了的一个也没有。相反的，由于运动开展了，党就能够吸收那些在运动中涌现出来的具有社会主义觉悟的优秀分子到自己的队伍里来，不断增强党的力量。干部也是要在斗争中培养的。过去几年来，各地已经培养了一批本地民族干部，他们在联系群众、贯彻执行党的政策、动员各族农民群众参加互助合作运动方面，起了重大作用。这种成绩应当发扬巩固。在今后的农业合作化运动中，尤其要善于发现具有社会主义觉悟的、办事公正、联系群众的本民族的积极分子，形成办社核心。大胆放手地提拔他们担任领导职务。用不断总结经验的方法提高他们的政策水平和办社能力。我们要时刻记住斯大林的教诲：要帮助少数民族“用自己的腿走路”。
    农业合作化运动的高潮在少数民族地区也要到来了！我们应当克服一切困难，坚决地、热情地、毫不犹豫地领导各族农民沿着社会主义道路前进。
