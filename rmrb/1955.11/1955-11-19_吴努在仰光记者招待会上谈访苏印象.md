　　吴努在仰光记者招待会上谈访苏印象
    新华社十八日讯　仰光消息：最近在访问苏联后回国的缅甸总理吴努十七日在仰光举行的记者招待会上说：“我在回来之后深信苏联领袖和人民是真正希望世界和平的。”
    吴努说，他印象特别深刻的是：苏联领袖们对于他们的国家的将来所怀的信心，他们要求文化和科学发展的强烈愿望以及他们的庞大的工业化计划。
    吴努在提到他同苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁发表的联合声明的时候说：“我想我用不着强调这项声明的意义，实际上，这项声明是苏联和缅甸联邦之间的友好的宪章。”吴努说：“我们两国的关系现在基于，并且今后也将基于这些坚定的原则：互相尊重领土完整和主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处和经济合作。”
    吴努说，他同苏联领袖们进行的会谈为发展两国的经济和文化合作创造了极大的可能性。
    吴努还说，他同印度和阿富汗领袖们举行的会谈是非常有益的。他在阿富汗曾经讨论过同那个国家建立外交关系的可能性。
