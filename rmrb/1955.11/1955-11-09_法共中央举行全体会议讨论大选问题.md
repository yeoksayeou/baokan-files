    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, November 7th -- TASS reports: The Central Committee of the French Communist Party held a plenary session on November 4th. Maurice Thorez delivered a report on the political situation and the tasks of the Communist Party at the meeting.
    The meeting decided to immediately begin raising campaign funds nationwide. The meeting called on all working people and democrats to do their best to provide material assistance to the Party in order to achieve victory over the reactionaries and to ensure the victory of a policy of peace, national independence and social progress.
    On the evening of the 4th, French Communist Party Central Committee Secretary Jacques Duclos held a press conference. Duclos explained the basic content of the report made by Party Central Committee General Secretary Maurice Thorez at the plenary session, emphasizing the great significance of this document. He also emphasized that the French Communist Party has always advocated proportional representation in parliamentary elections. Duclos said that the current task of the Communist Party is to strive for the abolition of the system of party alliances; if this system cannot be abolished, then it should be used to fight against reactionary forces. Duclos said that the Communist Party is prepared to reach an agreement with the Socialist Party on joint action in the election campaign. He cited many electoral districts where Communists and Socialists, if united, could get more than fifty percent of the vote. This would strike a blow at reactionary parties.
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch, Paris: The French National Assembly began debating the government's bill on holding early general elections and reforming the electoral system on October 30th. On November 3, the National Assembly held a vote of confidence on the government's bill to hold early elections six months ahead of schedule (i.e., in December of this year). The results of the vote were 330 in favor of early elections and 211 against. The French Communist Party is in favor of early elections.

    新华社七日讯　据塔斯社巴黎讯：法国共产党中央委员会十一月四日举行全体会议。多列士在会上作了关于政治形势和共产党的任务的报告。
    会议决定立刻开始在全国募集竞选运动基金。会议号召全体劳动人民和民主分子尽力给党以物质援助，以便取得对反动派的胜利，使和平、民族独立和社会进步的政策获得胜利。
    四日晚上，法国共产党中央委员会书记杜克洛举行记者招待会。杜克洛说明了党中央委员会总书记多列士在全体会议上所作的报告的基本内容，着重指出这个文件的重大意义。他并且着重指出：法国共产党在议会选举上始终主张采取比例代表制。杜克洛说，共产党当前的任务是：努力争取废除党派联盟制；如果不能取消这个制度，就利用它来同反动势力作斗争。杜克洛说，共产党准备在竞选运动中同社会党达成采取联合行动的协议。他列举了很多选区，在那里，共产党人和社会党人如果联合起来，就可以得到百分之五十以上的选票。这样，就会给反动政党以打击。
