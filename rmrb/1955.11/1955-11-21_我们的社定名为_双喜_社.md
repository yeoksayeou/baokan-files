　　Our Cooperative is Named "Double Happiness" Cooperative

Comrade Editor:

    When developing agricultural cooperatives last winter and this spring, Wu Yongde, a people's representative of Huangling Township, Xiaowu Village, Taiyuan City Suburb, and Wu Yunkuan, a member of the Communist Youth League, organized an agricultural cooperative of fifty-three households based on mutual aid teams. They voluntarily elected leaders, arranged production, and sent member registration forms to the district. Who knew that after waiting day and night, they didn't receive the good news of approval to establish the cooperative. The district said that their village had "a poor work foundation, a weak mutual aid foundation, and weak leading backbone..." and asked them to switch back to teams. This cold water poured on them, and many members were discouraged. Some even complained that the government was "treating sons differently even though they were the same"; thirteen cooperative members withdrew.

    However, the core members of this cooperative did not waver in their determination to run the cooperative. After holding a meeting of all cooperative cadres and a general meeting of all members, everyone decided to operate a "cooperative in secret under the name of a mutual aid team."

      "As long as everyone is of one mind, yellow soil can be turned into gold!" These forty farmers, wholeheartedly committed to running the cooperative, worked together to overcome one difficulty after another. The cooperative adopted a private-ownership-public-use leasing method for the members' livestock and farm tools, which solved the problem of means of production. At the beginning of spring plowing, in addition to investing more than 16,000 jin of fodder, the members spent twenty days digging more than 28,000 jin of reed roots from Hanxiguan, more than twenty miles away from the village, to use as feed, saving the cooperative 750 yuan. In order to solve the difficulty of insufficient production funds, in addition to investing nearly 7,000 jin of seeds and some cash, the members actively engaged in sideline production to support agricultural production. Because they implemented the management policy of "diligence and thrift, careful calculation," and achieved intensive cultivation, increased fertilization, selection of fine seeds, and planting according to local conditions in production, this year's autumn fields achieved a bumper harvest. The total autumn grain crops (including barley) of 606.7 mu averaged 290 jin per mu, exceeding last year by 70 jin. Cooperative member Han Wende had seven mu of alkaline land, which was suitable for planting millet. In the past, because there was little land and it was difficult to rotate crops, he had to plant corn, which often yielded nothing. This year, the entire plot was planted with millet, yielding 350 jin per mu. Cooperative member Yang Yongmao had 4.2 mu of sticky land, which used to produce only 70 jin of millet per mu; this year, he planted sorghum, which yielded 500 jin per mu.

    This year, the total net income of the cooperative's agriculture and sideline production was more than 16,000 yuan. Distributing according to labor, with 60% for land and 40% for labor (sideline income is distributed entirely according to labor), each work-day could earn 1.2 yuan, and one shi of grain-producing land could earn 4.2 yuan. The income of the cooperative members increased compared to before joining the cooperative. For example, Wu Yiren, a middle-class household, earned 4,000 jin of grain last year. This year, in addition to earning 4,454 jin of grain, he also earned 197 yuan in cash. Wu Tangzhou, 65, was the cooperative member with the lowest income, but in addition to the 791 jin produced by his own 4.7 mu of wheat land, he could also receive 2,295 jin of miscellaneous grains and 96 yuan in cash, greatly exceeding last year's income. He said with emotion: "In the past, all year round, I worried about everything. This year, after joining the cooperative, life is different. I really don't have to worry about food or clothing." Other cooperative members also happily said: Our cooperative is "less investment in the spring, more income in the autumn."

    The superiority of this "cooperative in secret under the name of a mutual aid team" has attracted farmers from the entire village. Now, twelve households in the village have signed up to join the cooperative. Dang Huifu, who withdrew from the cooperative this spring to work independently, has approached the cooperative director several times recently, requesting to rejoin the cooperative.

    On October 19th, after the cooperative members saw Chairman Mao's instructions on the issue of agricultural cooperation in the newspaper, they held a discussion meeting that evening. Cooperative Director Wu Yongde said: "Chairman Mao has approved us to run a cooperative, which is a great joy for us. After the autumn harvest is over, we must rectify the cooperative and not affect the reputation of the agricultural cooperative." Storekeeper Wu Siyuan happily said: "This year, our cooperative's crops have had a bumper harvest, and Chairman Mao has approved us to run a cooperative, which is truly a double happiness!" So, Accountant Wu Zhizhen suggested that the cooperative be called the "Double Happiness" Cooperative. This suggestion was unanimously approved by the cooperative members.

    Now, the Double Happiness Cooperative has been approved by the district. The cooperative members are enthusiastically engaged in autumn and winter production.

### 我们的社定名为“双喜”社

　　我们的社定名为“双喜”社编辑同志：
    在去冬今春发展农业社的时候，太原市郊区黄陵乡小吴村的乡人民代表吴永德和青年团员吴云宽等，在互助组的基础上组织了一个五十三户的农业社。他们自动选举了领导人员，安排了生产，并且给区里送了社员登记表。谁知道，日夜盼望，等来的不是批准建社的喜讯。区里说他们村“工作基础不好，互助基础薄弱，领导骨干不强……”，要他们转组。这一瓢冷水迎头泼来，不少社员都灰心泄气，有人就埋怨政府是“一样的儿子两样看待”；还有十三户社员就退了社。
    但是，这个社里的骨干分子们的办社决心并没有动摇。经过召开全社干部会议和全体社员大会，大家决心在互助组的名义下，搞一个“明组暗社”。
      “只要大家一条心，黄土也能变成金！”这四十户一心一意办社的农民，齐心协力，克服了一个接着一个的困难。社里对社员的牲畜、农具采取了私有公用的租用办法，解决了生产资料的问题。春耕生产开始的时候，社员们除了投资饲草一万六千多斤以外，又花了二十天时间到离村二十多里的旱西关刨了二万八千多斤蒲根做饲料，为社里节省了七百五十元的开支。为了解决生产底垫不足的困难，社员们除了投资种子近七千斤和一部分现金以外，还积极从事副业生产来支援农业生产。由于他们贯彻了“勤俭节约、精打细算”的管理方针，在生产上又做到了精耕细作、增施肥料、选用良种和因地种植，因而今年的秋田获得了丰收。全社六百零六亩七分秋粮作物（大麦在内），每亩平均收二百九十斤，超过去年七十斤。社员韩文德有碱地七亩，种糜子合适，往年因为地少调不开茬，只好种玉米，往往没有收成。这块地，今年全部种了糜子，每亩产了三百五十斤。社员杨永茂有四亩二分黏土地，往年种谷子，每亩只产七十斤；今年种了高粱，每亩就产五百斤。
    今年，全社农业和副业的纯收入为一万六千多元，按劳六地四分红（副业收入全按劳力分），每个劳动日可以分一元二角，一石产量的土地可以分四元二角。社员们收入都比入社以前增加了。如中常户吴依仁，去年收入粮食四千斤，今年除了收入粮食四千四百五十四斤以外，还收入现金一百九十七元。六十五岁的吴棠周是全社收入最少的一户，但是除了自种自收的四亩七分麦地产了七百九十一斤外，还可以分到杂粮二千二百九十五斤，现金九十六元，大大超过去年的收入。他感动地说：“往年一年四季，四愁四气。今年入了社日子就不一样了，真是吃不愁，穿不愁。”其他社员也高兴地说：咱们的社是“春天底垫少，秋季收入多”。
    这个“明组暗社”的优越性，吸引了全村农民。现在全村已有十二户报名入社。今春退社单干的党会福，最近好几次找社长要求回社。
    十月十九日，社员们看到了报纸上登载的毛主席关于农业合作化问题的指示以后，当天晚上就举行了座谈会。社长吴永德说：“毛主席批准咱们办社了，这是咱们的一件大喜事。秋收结束以后，咱们一定要把社整顿好，绝不能影响了农业社的名誉。”保管员吴四元高兴地说：“今年咱社庄稼丰收，毛主席又批准咱们搞社，可真是双喜临门！”于是，会计吴芝珍就建议把社叫成“双喜”社。这个意见得到社员们的一致同意。
    现在，双喜社已经被区里批准了。社员们正兴奋百倍地从事秋冬生产工作。
