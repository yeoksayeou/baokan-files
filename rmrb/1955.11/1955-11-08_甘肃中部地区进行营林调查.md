    Afforestation Survey Conducted in Central Gansu Province
    In September of this year, the Forest Survey Team of the Gansu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry dispatched an afforestation survey sub-team to conduct key typical surveys of water conservation forests and shelterbelts in Dingxi County, Haiyuan County, and Huining County in the arid central region. They have now surveyed 24,000 hectares. In addition to completing the planned task of 1,000 hectares, they are also preparing to exceed the target by surveying more than 3,000 hectares.
    The arid central region of Gansu Province includes places like Dingxi Prefecture and the Xihai Gu Hui Autonomous Region. The terrain here is uneven, consisting of hills and gullies. Rainstorms cause severe soil erosion, and agricultural production often suffers from poor harvests. In order to change this arid situation and ensure increased agricultural production, Gansu Province has decided to create large areas of water conservation forests and shelterbelts here. The afforestation survey sub-team is responsible for collecting materials and formulating afforestation plans for future afforestation efforts. After investigating the local soil conditions, plant growth, topography, and socio-economic conditions, they will conduct afforestation design work. Large-scale afforestation will begin here partially in the spring of next year. (Our Lanzhou Correspondent)

    甘肃中部地区进行营林调查
    甘肃省农林厅林野调查队今年九月间派出营林调查分队在中部干旱地区的定西县、海原县和会宁县进行水源林、防护林的重点典型调查。现在他们已调查完二万四千公顷，除将继续完成一千公顷的计划任务外，还准备再超额调查三千多公顷。
    甘肃省中部干旱地区包括定西专区和西海固回族自治区等地方，这里地形高低不平，都是丘陵沟壑，暴雨冲刷，水土流失很严重，农业生产常常歉收。为了改变这种干旱面貌，保证农业增产，甘肃省决定在这里营造大面积的水源林和防护林。营林调查分队负担着为将来造林搜集材料和制定造林计划的任务。他们在调查了当地的土壤条件、植物生长情况、地形状况、社会经济条件后，即将进行造林设计工作。大规模的造林明年春天就要在这里部分开始。　（本报驻兰州记者）
