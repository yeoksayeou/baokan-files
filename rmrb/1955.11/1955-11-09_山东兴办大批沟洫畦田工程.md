Shandong Province's ditch and ridge field projects, implemented in plains and low-lying areas over the past few years, have fully demonstrated their flood prevention capabilities. After focused pilot programs across the province, these projects have gradually expanded from specific points to wider areas. This year, with investment and technical guidance from the People's Government, eight special districts, including Heze, Changwei, Jiaozhou, Linyi, Huimin, Jining, Liaocheng, and Wendeng, have completed ditch and ridge field work on over 759,000 mu of low-lying land lacking drainage outlets. It is estimated that the entire annual plan of 910,000 mu can be completed before the ground freezes. Once these projects are completed, assuming a guaranteed grain production of 100 jin per mu, an annual increase of over 90 million jin of grain can be ensured.

This year, the 24 ditch and ridge field projects completed in the Heze Special District effectively prevented flooding in most low-lying areas during the continuous rainfall of 170 mm from July 1st to 4th. Previously, these low-lying areas would become a vast expanse of water with continuous rainfall exceeding 82 mm. Dingzhuang Depression in Juye County was also a dead-water depression that yielded little to no harvest in nine out of ten years. After the ditch and ridge field project was implemented this year, the depression did not accumulate water even with continuous rainfall of 128 mm in early July, resulting in the best crops in many years. This year, these 4,500 mu of low-lying land increased grain production by over 315,000 jin. (Lu Shui)

    山东兴办大批沟洫畦田工程
    山东省几年来在平原洼地兴办的沟洫畦田工程，已充分显示了它的防涝作用，全省经过重点试办，已由点向面逐步开展，今年在人民政府的投资扶持和技术指导下已在菏泽、昌潍、胶州、临沂、惠民、济宁、聊城、文登等八个专区无排水出路的洼地，完成了沟洫畦田工作七十五万九千多亩，预计在结冻前可全部完成全年九十一万亩计划。这些工程完成后，每亩以保产粮食一百斤计算，每年即可保证九千多万斤粮食的产量。
    菏泽专区今年完成的二十四处沟洫畦田工程，在七月一日至四日连续降雨达一百七十公厘的情况下，使绝大部分洼地避免了涝灾。从前这些洼地，在连续降雨八十二公厘以上时，即成一片汪洋。巨野县丁庄洼过去也是十年九不收的死水洼，今年作了沟洫畦田工程后，使洼地遇到七月初连续降雨一百二十八公厘时，都没有积水，成长了多年没有过的好庄稼，这四千五百亩洼地今年增产了三十一万五千多斤粮食。　（鲁水）
