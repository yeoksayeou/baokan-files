    Lime-soil foundation is a type of foundation made by mixing lime powder and loess, then watering and compacting the mixture. In the North China region, lime-soil foundations can be used for ordinary buildings such as offices, dormitories, auditoriums, residences, and dining halls up to four stories high, except in areas with complex geological conditions or where the load-bearing requirements are particularly high.

    Experience in North China has shown that lime-soil has strong durability and can maintain a relatively high strength over a long period. Moreover, the more evenly the lime-soil is mixed, the finer the particles, and the more firmly it is compacted, the higher the strength will be. At the same time, lime-soil, once compacted and hardened, is not easily permeable to water or absorbent.

    Using lime-soil foundations allows for the utilization of sandy clay excavated during trenching as raw material. The Third Engineering Company of the Shenyang Construction Engineering Bureau used this method when constructing a three-story building in 1954, saving 15 kilograms of cement per square meter of building area.

    灰土基础是用石灰粉末和黄土拌成的混合材料，经过洒水夯实以后做成的一种基础。在华北地区，一般在四层以下的办公室、宿舍、礼堂、住宅、饭厅等普通房屋，除地质情况复杂和承重量特别大的外，都可以采用灰土基础。
    华北地区的经验证明，灰土的耐久性很强，在长时期内可以保持比较高的强度。而且灰土拌合得越均匀，颗粒越细，夯得越坚实，强度就越高。同时，灰土夯实硬化后，还不易透水和吸水。
    采用灰土基础可以利用挖槽时挖出的砂质黏土作原料。沈阳建筑工程局第三工程公司一九五四年建筑三层楼房采用了这个办法，每平方公尺建筑面积节省了水泥十五公斤。
