The Hometown of the "Xinjiang Sheep"
　　Shang Jiong　Lian Shan
    In the eastern part of the Ili River Valley plain in the northwest border of the motherland, about 300 kilometers from Yining City, the capital of the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, lies a fertile and beautiful plain, the Gongnais River Valley. Going north from the Gongnais River Valley, there is an endless expanse of grassland. At the end of this grassland, across the Gongnais River, you can clearly see rows of snow-white houses on the opposite grassland. This is the home of the nationally renowned "Xinjiang Sheep" - the location of the Gongnais State-owned Stud Farm. Here, two years ago, China's first superior new breed of sheep, the "Xinjiang Sheep," was successfully cultivated.
    Before 1949, this place was just a barren grassland with withered pasture, and the stud farm had only a few dilapidated houses. Today, it has not only become a vast grassland covered with lush, green pasture, but the stud farm has also built new and beautiful houses on the grassland within a radius of more than 20 miles. From 1953 to the present, the farm has successively built sheep artificial insemination rooms, lambing pens (which can also be used as mating rooms and wintering pens), ram pens, medicated baths, veterinary workshops, as well as staff dormitories and offices, etc. The construction area totals more than 7,000 square meters.
    In the past, there were only a dozen cadres in this farm, and veterinarians and technical cadres were especially lacking. Now, the number of cadres has increased to twenty-three, including thirteen technical cadres and veterinarians, most of whom have received specialized education in colleges or above. More importantly, with the implementation of the enterprise management policy, this stud farm will not only no longer rely on state investment this year but will also begin to turn over profits to the state. In August, after the "Xinjiang Sheep" wool was harvested, the farm had already turned over 100,000 yuan in profits to the state.
    Due to the increase in the number of employees, the increasing perfection of equipment and instruments, and the improvement of production and operation management, the work of breeding "Xinjiang Sheep" at the Gongnais Stud Farm has made great achievements in a short period of several years. Now, the farm has a total of more than 15,000 "Xinjiang Sheep" breeding sheep (excluding the sheep that have been sold in previous years and this year), which is nearly double the number of sheep in the entire farm in 1949.
    The breeding work of "Xinjiang Sheep" began twenty years ago (1935). At that time, the Xinjiang Provincial Native Products Company imported sixty "Caucasian" breeding rams and a small number of "Precoce" breeding rams from the Soviet Union to crossbreed with the local "Kazakh" sheep and "Mongolian" sheep respectively. This work was initially supported and guided by Soviet experts Comrades Wielminchev and Mochenov. By 1938, 1,900 hybrid ewes from two paternal lines were selected and continued to be crossbred with "Caucasian" and "Precoce" breeding rams. In 1941, Soviet expert Comrade Troitsky came to Xinjiang to continue the breeding work in a planned manner. He selected the best No. 9 ram from the fourth generation of "Caucasian" hybrid rams and mated it with more than 250 excellent ewes of the same generation. As a result, the production performance of their offspring was better than that of other hybrid sheep, and the production performance of this batch of sheep was fixed. This played a decisive role in the breeding of "Xinjiang Sheep." During this period, Comrade Troitsky did a lot of hard work. In 1943, because the warlord Sheng Shicai exposed his counter-revolutionary true colors, persecuted and devastated all progressive undertakings, Comrade Troitsky had to terminate the breeding work of "Xinjiang Sheep" and return to his country. It was not until after the liberation of Xinjiang in 1949 that the breeding work of "Xinjiang Sheep" was resumed.
    In 1953, Soviet expert Comrade Troitsky came to Xinjiang again at the invitation of China to participate in this work. After careful appraisal, it was finally determined that the "Xinjiang Sheep" was indeed a new breed and the first best fine wool sheep breed in China. On March 20, 1954, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government of China announced that this fine wool sheep was officially named "Xinjiang Wool-Meat Dual-Purpose Fine Wool Sheep," or "Xinjiang Sheep" for short, and at the same time announced the cancellation of the original names "Lanha Sheep" or "Lanha Hybrid Sheep," etc. Since then, the "Xinjiang Sheep" began to enjoy a great reputation throughout the country.
    The breeding of "Xinjiang Sheep" is an inspiring and significant achievement in the development of animal husbandry in China. The quality of "Xinjiang Sheep" wool has greatly exceeded that of Australian wool, which is known as "the best in the world." In the past, the wool production of Chinese sheep was generally very low, and the wool quality was coarse and the uniformity of the wool was inconsistent, which was not suitable for weaving fine and thin woolen fabrics. Therefore, the weaving of woolen fabrics mostly relied on imports of fine wool from abroad. The breeding of "Xinjiang Sheep" is of great significance for gradually changing China's dependence on foreign countries for woolen fabric raw materials and promoting the development of China's woolen fabric weaving industry.
    Because the "Xinjiang Sheep" has many advantages, it is deeply loved and welcomed by the vast number of farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups throughout the country in its promotion and reproduction. In the past few years, the Gongnais Stud Farm alone has promoted more than 12,000 "Xinjiang Sheep" breeding sheep. Herdsmen in various places have actively used "Xinjiang Sheep" to improve local sheep breeds. In Xinjiang alone, herdsmen of all ethnic groups have used "Xinjiang Sheep" to improve more than 550,000 local sheep in recent years. This has played an important role in increasing the income of herdsmen and increasing the production of more livestock products to support national construction. This year, in order to support Xinjiang in improving 510,000 local sheep, the Gongnais Stud Farm has also carefully selected more than 3,180 excellent "Xinjiang Sheep" breeding sheep to supply the needs of breeding in various places. Among them, 1,079 "Xinjiang Sheep" ewes are being released for the first time this year. This batch of ewes will be completely handed over to state-owned farms in various places, and the state-owned farms in various places will use "Xinjiang Sheep" breeding rams to mate with them to expand the breeding range of "Xinjiang Sheep" breeding rams.
    In order to further meet the needs of Xinjiang and the rest of the country for improving local sheep breeds with "Xinjiang Sheep," the Gongnais Stud Farm has formulated a four-year breeding plan from 1954 to 1957 based on the production performance of "Xinjiang Sheep." More than 700 of the best grade ewes have been selected from the existing basic sheep flock to form a breeding group, and the remaining ewes have been used as a breeding group. According to this plan, after the completion of the four-year breeding work, the production performance of the offspring of the breeding group and the breeding group will be further improved in all aspects, whether in terms of wool or meat production, quality, and reproduction rate.
    Now, when we recall that the first batch of "Xinjiang Sheep" was airlifted to the Northeast in 1953, and only two years or so have passed, the "Xinjiang Sheep" has already been grazed on the vast grasslands of the Northeast and Northwest provinces of the motherland. From this, it can be imagined that with the completion of the four-year breeding plan of the Gongnais Stud Farm, the "Xinjiang Sheep" will surely be more widely and massively bred and grow on all the grasslands of the motherland.

　　“新疆羊”的故乡
　　尚炯　练善
    在祖国西北边疆伊犁河谷平原的东部，距伊犁哈萨克自治州的首府伊宁市约三百公里左右的地方，有一块富饶、美丽的平川，这就是巩乃斯川。从巩乃斯川往北走，前面是一望无边的大草原。在这个草原的尽头，隔巩乃斯河可以清楚地看见对岸草原上，矗立着一幢幢雪白的房舍。这就是全国闻名的“新疆羊”的故乡——地方国营巩乃斯种羊场的所在地。在这里，两年以前培育成功了我国第一个最优良的绵羊新品种——“新疆羊”。
    在一九四九年以前，这个地方只是一片牧草衰枯的荒草滩，种羊场只有几间破破烂烂的房子。如今这里不仅变成了长满丰茂、碧绿牧草的大草原，而且在方圆二十多里的草原上，种羊场已经修建起了一座一座崭新、漂亮的房舍。从一九五三年到现在，场里陆续修建了绵羊人工授精室、产羔圈（可兼做配种室和过冬圈）、公羊圈、药浴室、兽医工作室以及职工宿舍和办公室等等。建筑面积共约七千多平方公尺。
    过去这个场里只有十多个干部，兽医和技术干部更特别缺乏。现在，干部已增加到二十三人，其中技术干部和兽医就有十三人，他们绝大部分都受过专科以上学校的专门教育。更重要的是，随着企业化经营方针的贯彻执行，到今年这个种羊场不仅将不再依赖国家投资，而且开始给国家上缴利润。八月间，当“新疆羊”羊毛丰收以后，场里就已经给国家上缴了利润十万元。
    由于职工人数的增加，设备、器材的日趋完善和生产经营管理的改善，巩乃斯种羊场繁育“新疆羊”的工作，在短短的几年内就已经取得了很大成绩。现在全场共有“新疆羊”种羊一万五千多只（不包括历年和今年已经出场的羊只），较一九四九年全场羊只增加了将近一倍。
    “新疆羊”的育种工作开始于二十年前（一九三五年）。当时，新疆省土产公司从苏联输入了六十只“高加索”种公羊和少数“普利阔斯”种公羊，用来分别同当地的“哈萨克”羊和“蒙古”羊进行杂交。这一工作一开始，就得到了苏联专家伟尔明切夫和毛切诺夫两同志的具体帮助和指导。到一九三八年，又选择了两个父系的杂种母羊一千九百只，继续用“高加索”和“普利阔斯”种公羊进行杂交。一九四一年，苏联专家特罗依茨基同志来新疆，继续有计划地进行育种工作。他从“高加索”杂种第四代公羊中，选出最好的九号公羊一只跟同代优良母羊二百五十多只进行交配。结果它们后代的生产性能较其他杂种羊优良，便固定了这一批羊的生产性能。这对“新疆羊”的育成起了决定作用。这期间，特罗依茨基同志做了许多艰苦的工作。一九四三年，因为盛匪世才暴露了反革命的真面目，迫害和摧残一切进步事业，特罗依茨基同志不得不终止“新疆羊”的育种工作回国。直到一九四九年新疆解放后，“新疆羊”的育种工作才又恢复起来。
    一九五三年，苏联专家特罗依茨基同志应我国聘请再度来到新疆，参加了这个工作。经过仔细鉴定，终于最后确定“新疆羊”确实是一个新品种，是我国的第一个最好的细毛羊品种。一九五四年三月二十日，我国中央人民政府农业部宣布，把这种细毛羊正式命名为“新疆毛肉兼用细毛种羊”，简称“新疆羊”，同时宣布取消原名“兰哈羊”或“兰哈杂种羊”等名称。至此，“新疆羊”才开始在全国享有盛名。
    “新疆羊”的育成，是我国畜牧业发展中的一项振奋人心的重大成就。“新疆羊”羊毛的质量，已经大大超过了号称“世界第一”的澳大利亚羊毛。过去我国绵羊的产毛量大都很低，而且毛质粗，毛的匀度不一致，不适于纺织细薄呢绒，所以呢绒纺织，大都依赖国外输入细羊毛。“新疆羊”的育成，对于逐步改变我国呢绒纺织原料对外国的依赖性，促进我国呢绒纺织工业的发展具有重大作用。
    由于“新疆羊”具有很多优点，在推广和繁殖中，深受全国各地广大各族农牧民群众的喜爱和欢迎。几年来，仅巩乃斯种羊场推广出去的“新疆羊”种羊，就有一万二千多只。各地牧民用“新疆羊”积极进行了改良土种绵羊的工作。光新疆境内各族牧民最近几年内，就用“新疆羊”改良了五十五万多只土种绵羊。这对增加牧民收入和增产更多的畜产品支援国家建设起了重要作用。今年，巩乃斯种羊场为了支援新疆各地改良土种绵羊五十一万只，又精选了三千一百八十多只优良“新疆羊”种羊，供应各地配种的需要。其中有一千零七十九只“新疆羊”母羊今年还是第一次出场。这一批母羊将完全交给各地国营牧场，由各地国营牧场用“新疆羊”种公羊同它交配，以扩大“新疆羊”种公羊的繁殖范围。
    巩乃斯种羊场为了进一步满足新疆境内和全国各地用“新疆羊”改良土种绵羊的需要，已经根据“新疆羊”的生产性能，制定了一九五四年至一九五七年的四年育种计划，在现有基础羊群中挑选了最好的一级母羊七百多只成立了育种群，把其余母羊作为繁殖群。根据这个计划，四年育种工作完成以后，育种群和繁殖群的后代的生产性能，无论在毛或肉的产量、质量以及繁殖率等各方面，都将获得进一步提高。
    现在，当我们回忆起一九五三年第一批“新疆羊”空运东北，到现在时间仅仅过了两年左右，而“新疆羊”就已经牧放在祖国的东北和西北各省广阔的草原上了。由此可以想见，随着巩乃斯种羊场四年育种计划的完成，“新疆羊”必将更加普遍地、大量地在祖国所有的草原上繁殖和成长起来。（附图片）
