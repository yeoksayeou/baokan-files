　　A New Scientific Department—Automatic High-Speed Electronic Computer
　　Min Naida, Researcher at the Institute of Mathematics, Chinese Academy of Sciences
　　Electronic computers are a relatively recent scientific field. It has only been a little over a decade since the first electronic computer was invented. However, from its very inception, it has demonstrated its unparalleled importance in modern science and production. Some people compare the discovery of electronic computers to the discovery of the decimal system in history, and others even equate electronic computers and atomic energy as the two great discoveries of the 20th century.

　　Why does the discovery of electronic computers hold such enormous importance?

　　Throughout history, there have been countless significant inventions and discoveries, all sharing a common characteristic: they are designed to alleviate human physical labor. Giant excavators are merely a further development of human hands, fast trains are simply an extension of human legs, and the discoveries of telescopes and microscopes are merely enlargements of human eyes. However, the discovery of electronic computers has ushered in a new era, an era where humanity begins to use machines to save human mental labor.

　　The uses of electronic computers are multifaceted. First and foremost is their speed in calculation. We know that in modern physics, mathematics, mechanics, astronomy, chemistry, weather forecasting, statistics, and even modern engineering design, a large amount of numerical calculation (i.e., addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) is often required. For example, finding the solution to a large determinant or the sum of a series can take a lot of time, often one or two years for a single numerical problem. However, with electronic computers, we can greatly save people's labor in numerical calculation. In terms of calculation speed, electronic computers are exceptionally fast in this regard. If we don't include the time it takes to set up the electronic computer, and only compare the time spent on the calculation itself, then the electronic computer is more than 400,000 times faster than manual calculation, and tens of thousands of times faster than an ordinary accounting or statistical computer. For example, an electronic computer can perform 30,000 additions or subtractions of ten-digit numbers per second; it can perform 500 multiplications or divisions of ten-digit numbers per second. Moreover, when designing electronic computers, many calculation steps can be connected, allowing them to proceed automatically and continuously. We only need to adjust the calculation program, substitute the known conditions of the equation, and the electronic computer can accurately complete a large number of calculation actions in strict order, transferring the results of the calculation from one part of the machine to another. In a very short time, we can obtain the final result and transform it into a readily usable form. These calculation results often achieve extremely high precision, often to the order of one in a million or one in ten million.

　　It is conceivable that electronic computers with such a large numerical calculation capability will have significant applications in modern science, engineering, and national defense. For example, in engineering design, we sometimes need to solve a set of simultaneous equations with many unknowns. If the equation has thirty unknowns, it can be solved by an electronic computer in less than an hour. If we use the existing conventional methods, it is not only easy to make mistakes, but also takes a lot of time. That is to say, using electronic computers can help our engineering construction to be completed ahead of schedule.

　　Electronic computers can greatly promote the theoretical research of various precise sciences. For example, in modern science, it is often necessary to find the solutions to a series of extremely complex equations (linear and non-linear differential and integral equations, etc.), but these equations often cannot be answered by standard methods. Thus, scientists have to resort to numerical calculations. Some equations can be solved numerically in a relatively short period of time, while others are simply impossible because it may take decades to perform such calculations. However, with electronic computers, the situation is different, and it can generally solve these equations in a relatively short period of time. It is conceivable that this will have a significant impact on the development of these precise sciences. Because in these scientific fields, there are too many problems in history for which no solutions can be found, or for which the solutions are extremely imprecise. With electronic computers, there is great hope for solving these difficult problems.

　　Electronic computers can also greatly promote mathematical research. First of all, of course, is the branch of numerical calculation that is directly related to it. Since the advent of electronic computers, the direction of development and research methods of this scientific field have undergone great changes compared to the past. At the same time, electronic computers can also propose, promote, and assist the research of a series of theoretical mathematical problems. The field involved here is extremely broad, including almost all branches of analysis, as well as number theory, symbolic logic, functional analysis, and so on.

　　However, the uses of electronic computers are not limited to this. Its principles can also be widely used to solve problems in industrial production, transportation, military affairs, and so on. Because the working principles of electronic computers and the process of human neural control have some similarities, this type of machine can replace dispatchers in railway and air transportation, can be used to manage automated factories and automatic lathes, can manipulate the firing of artillery, control unmanned aircraft or navigation, and so on. At the same time, there is hope to use the principles of electronic computers to study such a complex and important problem: the principles of how the human brain works. This science is also beginning to develop. In short, this machine can be used as an auxiliary tool for thinking, helping people solve all kinds of problems.

　　According to the Soviet "Nature" magazine, issue 8, this year, electronic computers can also be used for translation. Experiments have shown that electronic computers equipped with special equipment can accurately translate English sentences into Russian, or Russian sentences into English. This type of machine can only perform the translation of general scientific literature and daily affairs for the time being, and cannot perform literary translations. But this alone is enough to greatly help translation work.

　　Electronic computers also bring new hope to the blind who cannot read newspapers and books. Electronic computers equipped with special equipment can translate the words and sentences in books into a language that can be heard.

　　In addition, electronic computers can also be used to organize scientific data or conduct statistical analysis of economic data. With the increasing development of science, it is becoming more and more necessary to timely record the data obtained in this field and in adjacent scientific fields. This requires the widespread use of high-speed scientific data processing machines to classify and statistically analyze the contents of the ever-growing world's scientific literature. According to some people's statistics, for the study of the element zinc in chemistry, there were a total of 7,281 papers from 1726 to 1926, but from 1926 to 1946, there were 19,431 papers. It is difficult to imagine that a scientist can find and read such a large amount of scientific data during research. However, with the use of this scientific data processing and statistical machine, the things previously recorded can be copied at high speed.

　　The above is just an introduction to some of the uses of this machine, and its future is limitless. In short, this is a scientific department that deserves special attention today, especially from the perspective of the high degree of automation and automatic control required for building a communist society, it is particularly necessary to develop this science from today onwards.

　　Just as with the emergence of any new scientific field, idealists always use new discoveries and difficulties in science to make epistemological distortions, there are also many idealist clamors surrounding the issue of electronic computers. Some people believe that electronic computers can completely replace human thinking in the future, clamoring for the use of "electronic brains" to replace human brains. Certain magazines in capitalist countries are even widely spreading this view, in order to arouse the fear of middle and lower-level intellectuals and achieve the goal of lowering their wages. However, this argument is completely incorrect. There is an essential difference between the human brain and any machine, and the human brain cannot be completely replaced by any machine, just as the discovery of airplanes and trains cannot completely replace people's hands and feet. However, conversely, if we completely deny that electronic computers can assist human thinking activities, deny that the research of electronic computers has any significance for the study of people's psychology, and denounce this view as a "mechanistic" view of the brain, this is also incorrect. Currently, Soviet scientific and philosophical circles have criticized this view. Clarifying these erroneous views is very necessary, and it will greatly help the development of this science.

　　一个新的科学部门—自动快速电子计算机
　　中国科学院数学研究所研究员　闵乃大
　　电子计算机是一个比较晚起的科学部门。从第一架电子计算机诞生，到现在才不过十几年的历史。然而从它的一出世起，就显示出它在近代的科学和生产上的无比的重要性。有些人把电子计算机的发现比作历史上十进位的发现，更有些人把电子计算机和原子能并列做二十世纪的两大发现。
　　为什么电子计算机的发现具有这样巨大的重要性呢？
　　从古到今，历史上曾经有过无数次的重大的发明、发现，这些发明、发现都有一个共同的特征，这就是：它们都是用来减轻人们的体力劳动的。巨大的掘土机只不过是人的手的进一步发展，快速的火车只不过是人的腿的进一步延长，望远镜和显微镜的发现也只是人的眼睛的扩大。可是电子计算机的发现却给我们开辟了一个新的时代，人类开始用机器来节省人们的脑力劳动的时代。
　　电子计算机的用途是多方面的。首先是关于快速计算方面。我们知道，在近代的物理学、数学、力学、天文学、化学、天气预报、统计学，乃至现代化的工程设计中，常常需要进行大量的数字计算（即加减乘除），例如，求一个大的行列式的解答、求一个级数的和等等，在计算中常要花费很多的时间，常常为某一数字问题要算上一两年。可是有了电子计算机以后，就能大大节省人们在数字计算方面的劳动。就计算速度来说，电子计算机在这方面是异常迅速的。如果我们不把调动电子计算机的时间算在内，仅在运算的时间上来比较，那末电子计算机就要比人工运算快四十万倍以上，比起一个普通结账或做统计用的计算机要快几万倍以上。例如，用电子计算机来算十位数字的加减法，每秒钟可做三万次；来做十位数字的乘除法，每秒钟可做五百次。而且，在设计电子计算机的时候，还可以把许多运算步骤连接起来，让它们自动地和连续地来进行。我们只要把计算程序调节好，把方程式的已知条件代进去，电子计算机便能按照严格的顺序确切地完成大量的运算动作，把运算的结果从机器的一部分传到另一部分，于是在很短时间就能得到最后的结果，并且把它化成便于利用的形式。这种计算结果常常能得到极高的精确度，它们的精确度常常是数百万分之一或是数千万分之一。
　　可以想见，具有这样大的数字计算的本领的电子计算机，将要在近代的科学上、工程上、国防上获得何等重大的应用价值。举例来说，我们在工程设计上，有时会须要解上一个含有很多未知数的联立方程式，假如这个方程式有三十个未知数，用电子计算机来计算，在一小时以内，便可算完。要是由现有的通常的方法来算，不但容易发生错误，而且需要的时间很多。这就是说，利用电子计算机，可以帮助我们的工程建设提前完成。
　　电子计算机能够大大地推动各种精密科学的理论的研究。例如，在近代科学中常常须要求出一系列极其复杂的方程式的解答（线性的和非线性的微分方程和积分方程等），可是这种方程式常常是标准方法所不能得出答案的，于是科学家们就只好诉之于数字计算。有些方程式用数字计算还可能在较短的时间内求了出来，有些就根本不可能，因为进行这种计算可能要花上十几年或是几十年的时间。可是有了电子计算机，这个情况就不同了，对于这些方程式，它一般地都能在较短的时间内就可以得出解答。可想而知，这样一来，对于这些精密科学的发展将要起着何等重大的作用。因为在这些科学部门，历史上找不出解答，或虽有解答，但解答得极不精确的问题实在太多了，而有了电子计算机，解决这些繁难的问题就大有希望了。
　　电子计算机还能大大推动数学的研究。首先当然是同它直接有关的数字计算这一部门。自从有了电子计算机，这个科学部门的发展方向、研究方法同以前比较起来，都有了很大的改变。同时，电子计算机还可以提出促进和帮助一系列的理论数学问题的研究。这里面所涉及的领域是极广的，包括着几乎是全部的分析的部门以及数论、符号逻辑、汎函分析等等部门。
　　然而电子计算机的用途还不止此。它的原理还可以广泛地利用来解决工业生产、交通运输、军事等等方面的问题。因为电子计算机的工作原理，和人们的神经控制的过程有若干类似的地方，所以，这种机器可以代替铁路和航空运输中的调度员，能够用来管理自动化工厂和自动车床，能够操纵炮火的发射，管制无人飞机或领航等。同时，利用电子计算机的原理还有希望来研究这样一个复杂而重要的问题：人的大脑如何工作的原理。现在这门科学也正在开始发展着。总之，这种机器可以被利用来作为思维的辅助的工具，帮助人们解决各种各样的问题。
    据苏联“自然”杂志今年第八期报道，电子计算机还能用来进行翻译。实验表明，装有特殊设备的电子计算机能够确切地把英文句子译成俄文，或把俄文句子译成英文。这种机器暂时还只能进行一般的科学文献和日常事务的翻译，不能进行文艺方面的翻译。但只此一端，就足以大大帮助了翻译工作。
    电子计算机对于看不见书报的盲人也带来新的福音。利用特殊设备的电子计算机就可以将书本上的字句翻译成可以听到的语言。
    此外，电子计算机还能用来整理科学资料或进行经济资料的统计。科学的日益发展就愈来愈有必要及时登录本门的和相邻的科学部门中所获得的资料，这就须要广泛利用高速度科学资料整理机来把不断增长的世界上全部科学文献的内容加以分类和统计。据某些人的统计，对于化学上的锌这一元素的研究，从一七二六年到一九二六年，共有七千二百八十一篇论文，但是从一九二六年到一九四六年就有一万九千四百三十一篇论文。很难设想，一个科学家在研究时能够找出并阅读如此大量的科学资料。可是利用了这科学资料整理机和统计机，就可以把它们以前所记录的东西以高速复制了出来。
    上面所介绍的还只是这种机器某些方面的用途，它的前途是不可限量的。总之，这是我们今天值得加以特别重视的一个科学部门，特别是从建设共产主义社会所要求高度的自动化和自动控制的观点出发，尤其须要从今天起就来发展这门科学。
    正如任何一个新的科学部门的出现，唯心论者总是利用科学上的新发现和困难来做出认识论上的歪曲一样，围绕着电子计算机问题上也有着极多的唯心论的叫嚷。有些人认为电子计算机在将来可以完全代替人的思维，叫嚷什么要用“电子大脑”来代替人的大脑。某些资本主义国家的杂志上，更在那里广泛地散布这种观点，好用来引起中下层知识分子的恐惧，达到压低他们的工资的目的。然而这种论断是完全不正确的，人的大脑和任何机器都有着本质的差别，人的大脑乃是任何机器所不能完全代替的，这正如飞机、火车的发现并不能完全代替人们的手和脚一样。但是反过来，如果完全否认电子计算机能够辅助人的思维活动，否认电子计算机的研究对人们的心理的研究有任何意义，并把这种观点斥之为一种大脑的“机械论”，这也是不对的。目前苏联科学界和哲学界已经对这种观点提出了批评。澄清这些错误的观点是很必要的，它将大大帮助这门科学的发展。
