How to Cherish Labor Models
    Lu Hao
    The Liaoning Provincial Federation of Trade Unions recorded the following passage in its work report on labor models: Wang Chonglun, a special-class labor model in Anshan City, participated in social activities for 118 days in 1954; from January to October 15, 1955, he did not work at his production post for 141 days because of participation in social activities. Wang Hengcheng, a coal miner in Benxi City, was originally punctual and never late or early for several years, but since Liaoning Province awarded him the title of Liaoning Provincial Industrial Labor Model, he spent 105 days participating in various social activities from January to September 29 of this year, which is a total of 241 days. This is almost the case with labor models in Liaoning Province: the more famous they are, the more serious the situation of being forced to leave production becomes.

    In our country, labor models are sincerely loved and respected by all the people, which is very natural. Therefore, it is also very natural for them to be entrusted by the people to attend some necessary meetings and carry out some necessary social activities. However, some leading staff members, regardless of the meeting, always like to invite labor models to participate for the sake of "grandeur"; no matter what work, they require labor models to take the lead. In this way, once an advanced worker becomes a labor model, he rarely has time or no time to participate in labor, and it is difficult to create new achievements in production. Some people even have very little time to rest. For example, the famous labor model Meng Tai, at one time, as soon as he got home from work, groups of elementary school children lined up in front of his door to visit him, one group after another, asking him to talk about his model deeds and his hopes for them. The children's enthusiasm is undeniable, but the problem is that the relevant leading organs turn a blind eye to such visits that affect Meng Tai's eating, resting, and studying. Labor model Wang Hengcheng is neither a member of the Benxi City Political Consultative Conference nor a representative of the Municipal People's Congress, but in January of this year, he was invited to attend the Municipal Political Consultative Conference and the Municipal People's Congress as a nonvoting delegate. In addition, he attended labor model symposiums, model evaluation meetings, and gave reports to elementary school students, which took up a total of eleven days.

    Some people say, "This is all because we cherish labor models!" But, if cherishing labor models deprives them of their production time, I think that is going too far!

    People who cherish labor models, please value the production time of labor models! Please help labor models create even greater achievements as much as possible! Labor models should be given genuine care and respect. Such care will benefit the country and the labor models themselves.

    怎样爱护劳动模范
    陆灏
    辽宁省工会联合会在关于劳动模范的工作报告上记载着下面一段材料：鞍山市特等劳动模范王崇伦，在一九五四年有一百一十八天参加社会活动；一九五五年一月到十月十五日，有一百四十一天因为参加社会活动没有到过生产岗位。本溪市采煤工人王恒成，本来是几年如一日地不缺勤、不迟到早退的，但是自从辽宁省授予了他以辽宁省工业劳动模范称号以后，今年一月到九月二十九日的二百四十一天内，就有一百零五天的时间参加各种社会活动。辽宁省的劳动模范几乎都是这样：越著名，被迫脱离生产的情况越严重。
    在我们的国家里，劳动模范受到全体人民的衷心爱戴和尊敬，这是非常自然的。因而他们受到人民的委托，出席一些必要的会议，进行一些必要的社会活动，也是很自然的事。但是，有些领导工作人员，不问什么会议，为了“隆重”起见，总喜欢请劳动模范参加；不管什么工作，都要求劳动模范带头。就这样，当一个先进工人成为劳动模范以后，就很少有时间或者没有时间参加劳动，在生产上就很难创造新的成就了。有的人甚至连休息的时间也很少。如著名的劳动模范孟泰，曾经有一个时期，一下班回到家里，小学校的小朋友们三五成群地在他的门口排着队来访问他，一队挨一队，要求他讲讲模范事迹，要求他讲讲对他们的希望。孩子们的热情是无可非难的，问题是有关的领导机关对于像这样使孟泰吃饭、休息、学习都受到影响的访问却熟视无睹。劳动模范王恒成既不是本溪市的政协代表，也不是市人民代表，但是在今年一月份，他被邀列席了市政治协商会议，又列席了市人民代表会议，加上劳动模范座谈会、评模会议，给小学生作报告等等，一共就占去了十一天的时间。
    有人说：“这都是因为我们爱护劳动模范啊！”但是，爱护得连劳动模范的生产时间都没有了，我想这就大可不必了！
    爱护劳动模范的人们，请你们珍惜劳动模范的生产时间！请你们尽可能地帮助劳动模范创造更大的成就！对劳动模范应当有真正的爱护和尊敬。这样的爱护，才能对国家有好处，对劳动模范有好处。
