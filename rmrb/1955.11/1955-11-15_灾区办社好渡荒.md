Running Cooperatives in Disaster Areas is Good for Overcoming Famine

　　Nanguan Village in Anci County, Hebei Province, is a village that suffers from floods year after year. In January of this year, a dispute arose among the cadres of this village. Some advocated running cooperatives to overcome famine, while others believed that cooperatives could not be run in disaster areas. Later, under the guidance and encouragement of the Party, Communist Party member Xing Zhihong and Communist Youth League member Zhou Guangzhi persuaded some farmers to establish an agricultural production cooperative of eight households. Before the spring plowing, they worked hard to develop sideline production, which not only solved the problem of spring famine for the eight households but also purchased wheat seeds for sowing. When spring plowing arrived, they sowed wheat on eight-tenths of the total land of the cooperative. The average yield per mu reached 146 jin. What about the individual farmers? They lacked this and that, and couldn't take care of everything. The wheat planting area of all individual households was less than four-tenths of the total land. The average yield was only 90 jin per mu. Now that the autumn harvest distribution has ended, some members of this cooperative have surplus income besides food and clothing. Facts are the most powerful propaganda. Now, eleven more households in this village are asking to join this cooperative, and another seven households are planning to establish new cooperatives.

　　The reason why farmers need to run cooperatives is precisely because they have difficulties in production and life. This is a theorem. Can cooperatives be run in disaster areas? The cooperative in Nanguan Village has already provided a positive answer with facts.

　  灾区办社好渡荒
    河北省安次县南关村是一个连年遭受水灾的村庄，今年一月，这个村的干部中发生了争论，有人主张办社渡荒，有人认为灾区不能办社。后来共产党员邢志洪和青年团员周广志在党的指示和鼓励之下，说服了部分农民，办起一个八户的农业生产合作社。在春耕以前，他们努力进行副业生产，不但解决了八户的春荒问题，还购买了播种小麦的种籽。春耕一到，他们就把全社十分之八的土地播种了小麦。每亩平均产量达到一百四十六斤。而单干农民呢？不是缺这个，就是少那个，顾了这头，顾不了那头，所有单干户的小麦播种面积还不到总地数的十分之四。收成每亩平均只有九十斤。现在，秋收分配已经结束，这个合作社有些社员的收入，吃穿而外，还有剩余。事实是最有力的宣传，现在这个村里的农民，又有十一户要求加入这个合作社，另外还有七户正在打算建立新社。
    农民所以需要办社，正是因为在生产与生活方面有困难，这是一条定理。灾区究竟能不能办社，南关村这个合作社已经用事实作了肯定的答复。
