    U.S. Secretary of State Dulles said not long ago that the U.S.'s mission is to make the U.S. "a country that supports the aspirations of all people."

    The U.S.'s attitude on the North African issue is probably the best illustration of this "mission" of the U.S. The people of North Africa aspire to independence, and French colonialists aspire to maintain their colonial rule in North Africa. Which aspiration does the U.S., which has always claimed to oppose colonialism and now says it wants to "support the aspirations of all people," support?

    The U.S.'s vote against discussing the Algerian issue in the United Nations General Assembly and the U.S.'s provision of helicopters to aid the French colonial army in attacking the Algerian people are already well-known facts. Recently, the U.S.'s "New York Post" admitted even more facts. The newspaper's reporter, Robert Allen, wrote: "The French, driven to the wall in the cruel struggle in North Africa, are getting much more than diplomatic help from the U.S. American military aid is playing a vital role in the critical situation." He cited the following "publishable" facts: The U.S. "promised to grant France's request: unlimited use of American weapons" to suppress the North African people, "planes taking off from the 35,000-ton aircraft carrier 'Lake Champlain' 'displayed strength' over the threatened port of Rio Tinto," "French transport planes carrying urgently needed reinforcements and supplies were allowed to land at the U.S.'s largest air base in Morocco - the Nouasseur Air Base near Casablanca."

    It seems very clear that the U.S. supports the French colonialists, not the people of North Africa.

    But the matter does not end there. The "New York Post" reporter frankly talked about the U.S.'s active support for French colonialists in order to maintain some of the U.S.'s "most important strategic air bases" in North Africa. However, there is another more important reason, which the "New York Post" reporter did not mention, but the French have already seen. The French weekly "International Forum" revealed that U.S. Ambassador to South Africa, Wells, recently submitted a report to the U.S. State Department on U.S. policy toward Africa. He urged Washington to pay attention to the fact that: "With the world's resource resources dwindling, the African continent is of paramount importance to the United States. Many of its rich resources have not yet been developed, making it possible to realize substantial profits, given that local labor is very cheap. In addition to economic benefits, strategic benefits should also be added. Consolidating U.S. power on the African continent will certainly require less effort than in Asia and the Middle East." This "visionary" diplomat also meaningfully reminded the U.S. State Department in the report: "France is no longer capable of leading the people of North Africa." The implication is that the time has come for the U.S. to replace France in North Africa.

    Does the U.S. "support the aspirations of all people"? The U.S. does not support the aspirations of anyone. What it supports is only its own aspirations for expansion and aggression. (Rui)

### 美国支持谁的愿望

    美国支持谁的愿望
    杜勒斯不久以前说，美国的任务是使美国“成为一个支持所有人的愿望的国家”。
    美国在北非问题上的态度大概是最能说明美国的这种“任务”的了。北非人民愿望独立，法国殖民主义者愿望保持自己在北非的殖民统治。一向自称反对殖民主义、现在又说要“支持所有人的愿望”的美国支持哪一种愿望呢？
    美国在联合国大会中投票反对讨论阿尔及利亚问题，美国以直升飞机援助法国殖民军队进攻阿尔及利亚人民，早已是人所共知的事情了。最近美国的“纽约邮报”又承认了更多的事实。这个报纸的记者罗伯特·艾伦写道：“被逼得走头无路的法国人在北非的残酷斗争中正在从美国得到许多甚于外交援助的东西。美国的军事援助正在这个危急的局势中起着重要作用。”他举出这样一些“可以发表”的事实：美国“答应法国所提出的要求：无限制地使用美国武器”镇压北非人民，“从三万五千吨的航空母舰‘钱普雷因湖号’起飞的（美国）飞机在受到战斗威胁的里俄蒂港上空‘显示了力量’”，“运载迫切需要的援军和供应品的法国运输机被允许在美国在摩洛哥最大的空军基地——卡萨布兰卡附近的诺阿索机场降落”。
    看来很清楚，美国支持的是法国殖民主义者而不是北非人民。
    但是，事情还不止这样。“纽约邮报”的记者坦白地谈到美国之所以积极支持法国殖民主义者，是为了保持美国在北非的一些“最重要的战略空军基地”。但是，还有另外一个更重要的原因，“纽约邮报”的记者没有说出来，而法国人却已经看到了。法国的“国际论坛”周刊揭露，美国驻南非大使韦尔斯不久以前曾向美国国务院提出了一个关于美国非洲政策的报告。他促使华盛顿当局注意这样的事实：“随着世界的原料资源的减少，非洲大陆对美国具有头等重要的意义。那里的许多丰富资源还没有开发，使人得以实现优厚的利润，既然当地的人力非常低廉。除了经济上的好处之外，还应该加上战略性的好处。要在非洲大陆巩固美国势力，肯定要比在亚洲和中东需要做的事情少得多。”这位“有眼光”的外交家并且在报告中意味深长地提醒美国国务院：“法国再也没有能力领导北非各国人民了”。意思就是说，美国在北非取法国而代之的时候到了。
    美国“支持所有人的愿望”吗？美国对任何人的愿望也不支持，它所支持的只是自己的扩张和侵略的愿望。　　　　（瑞）
