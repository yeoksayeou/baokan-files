Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 27th: Representatives from the Japanese Socialist Party, the Japanese Red Cross Society, the Japan-China Friendship Association, and the Japan Peace Liaison Committee demanded on November 26th that Justice Minister Ryozo Makino immediately release the five Chinese nationals, including Hong Jinshan, detained by the Japanese authorities. The representatives said that the Japanese government should respect Hong Jinshan's wishes and allow him to return to China.

The representatives also pointed out to Makino Ryozo that the conflict that occurred in the Hamamatsu "Reception Center" in early November was clearly caused by the Japanese government's unjustified action of forcibly sending more than 100 Chinese nationals detained in the "Reception Center" to Taiwan.

　　日本社会党和日本红十字会等三团体
  　要求日本政府立即释放被拘留的五名华侨
    新华社二十七日讯　东京消息：日本社会党和日本红十字会、日中友好协会、日本和平联络会的代表，十一月二十六日要求法务相牧野良三立即释放被日本当局拘留的中国侨民洪进山等五人。代表们说，日本政府应该尊重洪进山的愿望，使他回到中国去。
    代表们还向牧野良三指出，十一月初在滨松“收容所”发生的冲突事件，显然是由于日本政府毫无理由地把被拘留在这个“收容所”的一百多名中国侨民强制送到台湾去的行动引起的。
