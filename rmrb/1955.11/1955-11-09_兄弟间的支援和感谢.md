The entire staff of the state-owned Wuhan First Cotton Textile Factory and five factories including the joint state-private Hankou First Textile Company, Yuhua Textile Factory, Shenxin Fourth Factory, and Zhenhuan Yarn Factory, jointly wrote a letter to the farmers of Hubei Province, thanking them for producing good cotton this year.

In the past, the quality of cotton in Hubei was very low. It caused great losses and many breaks when used for spinning and weaving, and the finished products did not meet the standards stipulated by the state.

In October of this year, the raw cotton used by the factories was mostly the first batch of improved cotton produced by various agricultural production cooperatives in Hubei Province. This batch of new cotton is generally Grade 5, and its maturity, strength, and color are comparable to Henan cotton. Spinning and weaving with this cotton is very smooth, the quality of yarn and cloth has improved, and more than 30,000 catties of cotton can be saved each month.

Therefore, the entire staff of the five yarn factories wrote a special letter to express their gratitude to the farmers of Hubei Province. The letter said: "Let us consolidate the worker-peasant alliance a hundredfold, hand in hand and shoulder to shoulder, to strive to overfulfill and complete the first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy ahead of schedule."

    兄弟间的支援和感谢
    国营武汉第一棉纺织厂和公私合营汉口第一纺织公司、裕华纺织厂、申新四厂、震寰纱厂等五个工厂的全体职工，联名给湖北全省农民写了一封信，感谢他们今年生产了好棉花。
    过去，湖北的棉花质量很低，用来纺纱、织布损失大，断头多，成品都达不到国家规定的标准。
    今年十月份各厂使用的原棉，绝大部分都是湖北省各个农业生产合作社生产的第一批改良棉花。这批新棉一般都是五级的，成熟度、强度、色泽都可同河南棉媲美。用这种棉花纺织，操作很顺利，纱和布的质量提高了，而且，每个月还可节约三万多斤棉花。
    五个纱厂的全体职工因此专门写信向湖北省农民表示感谢。信里面说：“让我们百倍地巩固工农联盟，手携手，肩并肩地为超额和提前完成国家发展国民经济的第一个五年计划而奋斗。”
