　　National Conference on Supporting the Military and Providing for Veterans Concludes
　  Focuses on Studying the Issue of Helping Families of Martyrs, Military Dependents, Demobilized Soldiers, and Disabled Soldiers Participate in Agricultural Cooperatives
    Xinhua News Agency, 15th. The National Conference on Supporting the Military and Providing for Veterans, which began on the 1st, concluded on the 15th. This conference focused on studying how to assist the families of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary soldiers, demobilized construction soldiers, and revolutionary disabled soldiers in participating in agricultural production cooperatives amidst the high tide of the national agricultural cooperation movement.

    The conference believes that civil affairs departments at all levels have achieved successes in helping rural families of martyrs and military dependents participate in agricultural mutual aid and cooperative organizations in 1955. In 1955, approximately 42.7 million yuan was used nationwide to help poor families of martyrs and military dependents solve the difficulties of production materials, accounting for 53.7 percent of all subsidies for families of martyrs and military dependents. As of August this year, 37 percent of the total number of families of martyrs and military dependents who received production material subsidies nationwide have joined agricultural production cooperatives. After analyzing the current situation of rural families of martyrs and military dependents, the conference pointed out that during the high tide of the agricultural cooperation movement, preferential treatment work should adapt to the progress of the overall agricultural cooperation plan, educating and mobilizing families of martyrs and military dependents to participate in agricultural production cooperatives in batches each year based on the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit. Civil affairs departments at all levels should also help families of martyrs and military dependents who lack labor or production materials to solve the difficulties of joining the cooperatives.

    The conference also studied urban preferential treatment work. The conference believes that urban preferential treatment work has achieved great successes in recent years. At present, the vast majority of families of martyrs and military dependents have been employed or organized to engage in production. In the future, efforts should focus on rectifying the production units organized by families of martyrs and military dependents to consolidate and improve them, and gradually incorporate them into the track of handicraft industrial cooperation. Continued assistance should be given to families of martyrs and military dependents who must be introduced to occupations and organized for production, helping them find employment and organizing them to engage in service and processing production. The work of providing regular and quantitative living allowances and temporary living allowances to 10 percent of poor families of martyrs and military dependents should also be done well.

    The conference believes that the work of resettling demobilized construction soldiers in rural and urban areas in 1955 has also been successful. Except for more than 23,000 demobilized construction soldiers who have yet to be resettled, all those who returned to various parts of the country have been resettled, and these 23,000 people will also be resettled by the end of the year. About 80 percent of the demobilized construction soldiers who returned to rural areas have joined mutual aid and cooperative organizations. The conference believes that the task of resettling demobilized construction soldiers in 1956 remains arduous, and requires civil affairs departments in all regions to properly resettle the demobilized construction soldiers of 1956 before the end of October 1956. Demobilized construction soldiers returning to rural areas in 1956 who meet the conditions for joining the cooperatives should be assisted in joining cooperatives in batches under the local agricultural cooperation plan. Civil affairs departments at all levels should formulate specific plans to help demobilized construction soldiers join the cooperatives, and should incorporate this plan into the overall agricultural cooperation plan of the local area. Demobilized construction soldiers returning to cities in 1956 must also be properly resettled so that they can play an active role in the cause of socialist construction.

    The conference believes that the victorious development of the agricultural cooperation movement has provided favorable conditions for supporting the military, providing for veterans, civil affairs departments at all levels must adapt to the development of the agricultural cooperation movement, and under the unified leadership and unified deployment of the Party and the government, further educate cadres, mobilize the masses, and do a good job in supporting the military and providing for veterans.

　　全国优抚、复员工作会议结束
　  着重研究了帮助烈属、军属、复员军人和残废军人参加农业合作社的问题
    新华社十五日讯　一日起举行的全国优抚、复员工作会议已经在十五日结束。这次会议着重研究了在全国农业合作化运动高潮中如何帮助革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、复员建设军人和革命残废军人参加农业生产合作社的问题。
    会议认为，各级民政部门在一九五五年帮助农村的烈属、军属参加农业互助合作组织是有成绩的。一九五五年，全国用于帮助贫困烈属、军属解决生产资料困难的经费有四千二百七十万元左右，占烈属、军属全部补助费百分之五十三点七。截至今年八月，全国得到生产资料补助的烈属、军属总户数中已有百分之三十七加入了农业生产合作社。会议在分析了目前农村烈属、军属的情况以后指出，在农业合作化运动高潮中，优抚工作应该适应农业合作化全面规划的进度，教育和发动烈属、军属逐年分批地根据自愿和互利的原则参加农业生产合作社。各级民政部门还应该帮助劳动力不足或者缺少生产资料的烈属、军属解决入社困难。
    会议对城市优抚工作也进行了研究。会议认为，几年来城市优抚工作是有很大成绩的，目前绝大部分烈属、军属都已经就业或者组织起来从事生产，今后应该着重对烈属、军属所组织的生产单位进行整顿，使之巩固和提高，逐步地纳入手工业合作化的轨道。对必须介绍职业和组织生产的烈属、军属，仍应继续帮助他们就业和组织他们进行服务性和加工性的生产。并且做好对百分之十的贫困烈属、军属给以定期定量的生活补助和临时生活补助的工作。
    会议认为，一九五五年在乡村和城市中安置复员建设军人的工作也是有成绩的。回到全国各地的复员建设军人除了还有二万三千多人外，都已经得到安置，这二万三千多人也将在年底以前得到安置。回到农村的复员建设军人已有百分之八十左右参加了互助合作组织。会议认为一九五六年安置复员建设军人工作的任务仍是繁重的，要求各地民政部门必须在一九五六年十月底以前把一九五六年的复员建设军人加以妥善安置。一九五六年回到农村的复员建设军人，其中凡是具备入社条件的，都应该在当地农业合作化的规划下，帮助他们分批入社。各级民政部门应该制定帮助复员建设军人入社的具体计划，并且要把这个计划纳入当地农业合作化的全面规划中。对一九五六年回到城市的复员建设军人，也必须妥善安置，使他们在社会主义建设事业中发挥积极作用。
    会议认为，农业合作化运动的胜利开展，给优抚、复员工作提供了有利的条件，各级民政部门必须适应农业合作化运动的发展，在党和政府的统一领导、统一部署下，进一步地教育干部，发动群众，做好优抚、复员工作。
