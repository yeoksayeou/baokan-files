Actively and systematically develop the agricultural collectivization movement
Fully promote democracy in rectifying agricultural cooperatives
Su Han Li Huzhen
    In order to gain experience in rectifying agricultural production cooperatives, the Wuxiang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Shanxi Province, organized two work teams in late September to conduct pilot rectification in Wangbaiyin and Shibi townships, which had basically achieved semi-socialist cooperation.
    After the work teams arrived in the townships, they first trained all Party members in order to rely on the branches to carry out the rectification work. Among the 34 Party members in the Wangbaiyin Township branch, 10 Party members were proactive in their work and actively responsible for the rectification work; 11 Party members were usually active in their work, but had shortcomings in their style, and they were afraid that the masses would give them opinions in this rectification; 8 Party members were usually passive in their work and did not care about the rectification work; in addition, there were a very few Party members who had violated laws and disciplines, and were only worried about how their problems would be handled, and resisted the rectification work. The work teams and township branches explained the guiding principles, policies, and significance of the rectification to the Party members, and promoted them to examine their thoughts and work in the spirit of criticism and self-criticism. In this way, the attitude of the Party members was corrected, the Party's internal thinking was unified, and various confused thoughts and wrong behaviors were liquidated and criticized.
    Then, the Party and League members of each cooperative formulated rectification plans according to the situation and problems in their own cooperatives. In the case of three cooperatives such as Hejiannao, the production in the cooperatives was good, and the members' morale was high, but there were some deviations in the implementation of policies (such as the phenomenon of over- or under-evaluation of land production). These cooperatives adopted the "old ten points" method of recording work in labor management. The rectification of such cooperatives is to implement the policy of mutual benefit and strengthen business management to further consolidate and improve them. The production of six cooperatives such as Nanpo was average, but there were deviations in the implementation of policies, and the management of agricultural implements and the feeding of draught animals were very chaotic; the land was not evaluated for production (dividends were distributed based on the expected output), and the members were very dissatisfied with these problems. The rectification of such cooperatives is to improve business management and correct deviations in policy implementation. The voluntary and mutually beneficial policy was not implemented in four cooperatives such as Shijianao, and the problems of determining the proportion of share funds, labor force and land dividends, and the valuation of agricultural implements were not resolved. There was also the phenomenon of forcibly pulling wealthy households into the cooperatives in such cooperatives. For example, twelve households, including Wang Gouer, absorbed by the Haojianao Cooperative last year, were all well-to-do middle peasants, and even now there are six households whose thoughts are turbulent. The cadres of the Shijianao Cooperative also privately lent 70 yuan of the cooperative's loans to landlord elements outside the cooperative. The rectification of such very unconsolidated cooperatives is to comprehensively implement the voluntary and mutually beneficial policy, purge bad elements, and purify the organization; on this basis, establish and improve various systems to organize production.
    The above is just a general overview of the various types of cooperatives. To further understand the specific problems in each cooperative and solve these problems, it is also necessary to mobilize the members of the cooperatives to give their opinions and fully promote democracy. Only in this way can the rectification work be done well.
    The purpose of the rectification is to correct deviations in the implementation of policies, ensure increased production, increase income, and run the cooperatives well. This is what the members welcome. However, at the beginning of the rectification, some members did not dare to expose problems. The situation of the Shijianao Cooperative was like this. When the work team first arrived in the village, they could not understand any problems. Later, when they held symposiums for people from all walks of life, they learned about the opinions of people from all walks of life on the cooperatives. At the symposium of poor peasants in Wangbaiyin Township, it was found that there was a phenomenon of excluding poor peasants in the cooperatives, and the investment in the cooperatives was divided equally between labor and land, which disadvantaged the poor peasants. At the symposium of middle peasants in various villages, the phenomenon of certain cooperatives infringing on the interests of middle peasants was also revealed. Ren Panghai, a well-to-do middle peasant member of the Fuzhuang Cooperative, said: "I have half an oil mill, a large cart, a chaff cutter, and a plough. These things have not been valued or rented, and the cooperative has used them for two years in vain, and I am not satisfied." At the symposium of old peasants held by the Shibi Cooperative, the old peasants actively put forward opinions on the lack of public disclosure of the cooperative's economy, the members' lack of care for public property, and the unclear accounting.
    Sometimes some people could not open up at the symposium, especially some members who were unwilling to talk about certain issues that they suspected but could not confirm. Therefore, the work team and the township branch further understood the problems of the cooperatives through individual visits. Through individual visits, they learned that the financial management of the Shibi Cooperative was very chaotic. The 204 yuan of sideline income earned by the cooperative last year and the 30 catties of cotton harvested last autumn have not yet been distributed to the members; the 28,000 catties of coal accumulated last winter have not been distributed to the members, and now only 10,000 catties are left, and the rest is unknown; the accounts in the cooperative are unclear, and member Wang Yuanzhong invested four dou of cattle feed last winter, which has not yet been recorded. During the individual visits, they also learned about the unreasonable investment methods of the Haojianao Cooperative. Li Jinxian, a poor peasant member of this cooperative, sold half of his property to pay off the investment.
    In the process of rectifying the cooperatives, a meeting of representatives of farmers outside the cooperatives was also held to introduce the situation of the cooperatives, publicize the various policies of cooperation and the superiority of the cooperatives, and ask them to put forward criticisms and suggestions on the work of the cooperatives. Among the 43 farmers outside the cooperatives in Wangbaiyin Township, 21 have actively requested to join the cooperatives because they have seen that the production in the cooperatives is good and the output is high. These people especially hope that the cooperatives will be rectified this time so that they can join the cooperatives in the future. Li Wanbao and other poor peasants outside the cooperative criticized the cooperative in their village, saying that they had repeatedly requested to join the cooperative last year, but were rejected by the cooperative because of their poverty and difficulty in investing. The eight draught cattle of the Shijianao Cooperative were all fed very thinly, and the Shibi Cooperative wasted fodder. These shortcomings were also criticized by farmers outside the cooperative.
    The problems of the cooperatives have been exposed, and the members of the cooperatives and the farmers outside the cooperatives are concerned about the solution of these problems. After the rectification of some cooperatives this summer, the problems raised were not solved, which disappointed the members. Learning from past lessons, the work team and the branch seriously handled the problems revealed this time. Generally speaking, this rectification mainly solved the following problems:
    First, the policy of voluntary mutual benefit was implemented. Cooperatives that had not evaluated land production divided the land into different grades and categories, and organized evaluation groups to evaluate production. Cooperatives that had improperly evaluated production were adjusted in conjunction with the "three fix" work of grain. Cooperatives that had improper methods of paying share funds were changed to pay according to the ratio of six for land and four for labor. Cooperatives that had improperly handled the issue of agricultural implements joining the cooperative stipulated this time that the price of agricultural implements should be shared according to the share funds, and clearly stipulated the repayment period.
    Second, the organization of the cooperative was purified, and the leadership composition of the cooperative was adjusted. In the middle of the rectification, Shi Huaien and other two landlord elements who sabotaged the cooperative were punished according to law; and the facts that the landlord and rich peasant elements sabotaged the cooperative were publicized in a big way to raise the vigilance of the masses. There were 93 committee members in the two townships, and originally there were 53 poor peasants and new and old lower-middle peasants, accounting for 57% of the total number of cooperative cadres; after the adjustment, there are now 72 poor peasants and new and old lower-middle peasant cooperative cadres, accounting for 77% of the total number of cooperative cadres.
    Third, business management has been improved. In cooperatives with serious problems of wasted work, the method of recording work by the piece was implemented. Cooperatives with poor systems for the management and use of agricultural implements established systems for the management and use of agricultural implements. Cooperatives with poor feeding of draught animals improved the feeding system. Through the rectification of labor organizations, some members who did not work well were criticized, and members who worked actively were commended.
    Because democracy was fully promoted in the process of rectification, and the spirit of "everyone's cooperative is run by everyone" was reflected, the members' enthusiasm for production became even higher. The cooperative has made remarkable achievements in production. The 2,868 mu of wheat in the two townships were all sown in time. In order to achieve careful harvesting and threshing, each cooperative organized a grain picking team. After the rectification, the two townships also carried out production planning, which pointed out a clear direction for the development of production in the two townships. In this way, the influence of the cooperative has been further expanded, and the masses outside the cooperative have requested to join the cooperative. A total of 90 farmers in the two townships have requested to join the cooperative, and 61 have now been admitted to the cooperative.

　　积极地有计划地开展农业合作化运动
　　整顿农业合作社要充分发扬民主
　　苏寒　李虎珍
    为了取得整顿农业生产合作社的经验，中共山西省武乡县委从九月下旬起组织了两个工作组，分别到已经基本上实现了半社会主义合作化的王白堙、石鼻两乡，进行了整社试点。
    整社工作组到乡后，首先集训了全部党员，以便依靠支部开展整社工作。王白堙乡支部三十四个党员中，有十个党员工作主动，对整社工作积极负责；有十一个党员虽然平时工作积极，但是作风有缺点，他们怕在这次整社中群众给他们提意见；有八个党员平时工作消极，对整社工作也不关心；此外还有极少数有违法乱纪行为的党员，只担心自己的问题如何处理，对整社工作有抵触情绪。工作组和乡支部向党员说明了整社的方针政策和意义，推动他们以批评和自我批评的精神检查思想和工作。这样，就端正了党员的态度，统一了党内思想，各种糊涂思想和错误行为都受到了清算和批判。
    接着，各社党、团员根据自己社内的情况和问题，拟定整社方案。合尖垴等三个社的情况是社内生产好，社员情绪高，但是执行政策有些偏差（如土地评产有过高过低的现象）。这类社在劳动管理上采用“老十分”的记工办法。对这类社的整顿，是要贯彻执行互利政策，加强经营管理，使之进一步巩固、提高。南坡等六个社的生产情况一般，但是执行政策有偏差，农具保管和耕畜喂养等方面都很混乱；土地未评产（是以应产量进行分红），社员对这些问题非常不满。对这类社的整顿，是要改善经营管理，纠正政策执行上的偏差。史家垴等四个社没有执行自愿互利政策，股份基金、劳力土地分红比例的确定以及农具作价等问题都没有解决。这类社还有硬拉富裕户入社的现象，如去年郝家垴合作社吸收的王苟儿等十二户，都是富裕中农，直到现在还有六户思想动荡不安。史家垴合作社干部还把社内贷款私自借给社外的地主分子七十元。对这类很不巩固的合作社的整顿，是要全面贯彻执行自愿互利政策，清洗坏分子，纯洁组织；在这个基础上建立和健全各种制度，组织生产。
    上面说的只是各类合作社的大概情况，要进一步摸清各个合作社内的具体问题，并且解决这些问题，还必须发动社员群众，给合作社提意见，充分发扬民主，只有这样，才能把整社工作做好。
    整社的目的是要纠正执行政策中的偏差，保证增产，增加收入，把社办好。这是社员们所欢迎的。但是整社开始的时候，有些社员还不敢揭发暴露问题。史家垴合作社的情况就是如此。工作组刚到村里的时候，什么问题都了解不到。后来召开各阶层的座谈会，才了解到各阶层对合作社的意见。在王白堙乡的贫农座谈会上就发现了合作社有排斥贫农的现象，社内按劳力、土地各半的比例投资，使贫农吃亏。在各村的中农座谈会上，某些合作社侵犯中农利益的现象也被揭发了出来。富庄合作社富裕中农社员任胖孩说：“我有半座油房、一辆大车、一口铡刀、一张耕犁，这些东西既没有作价，也没有租费，社内白白用了二年，我是不满意的。”石鼻合作社召开的老农座谈会上，老农积极提出了社内经济不公开、社员不爱护公物、会计账目不清等意见。
    有些人在座谈会上有时还打不开情面，特别是有些社员对于某些有怀疑而不能肯定的问题还不肯谈。于是工作组和乡支部就通过个别访问，进一步了解合作社的问题。经过个别访问，他们了解到石鼻合作社的财务管理十分混乱，去年合作社赚下的二百零四元副业款和去秋收的三十斤棉花至今还未分给社员；去冬积下的煤共二万八千斤，也未分给社员，现在只剩下一万斤，其余的不知下落；社内账目不清，社员王元中去冬投资四斗牛料，至今还未上账。在个别访问中，还了解到郝家垴合作社投资办法不合理的情况，这个合作社的贫农社员李锦先等卖了半份家当才还清投资款。
    在整顿合作社的过程中，还召开了社外农民代表会，介绍社内情况，宣传合作化的各项政策和合作社的优越性，并且请他们对合作社的工作提出批评建议。王白堙乡共四十三户社外农民，已有二十一户由于看到社内生产好产量高而积极要求入社。这些人特别希望这次把合作社整顿好，将来他们好入社。李万保等社外贫农批评本村的合作社说：去年他们曾多次要求入社，但是因家贫投资困难，被合作社拒绝。史家垴合作社的八头耕牛都喂得很瘦，石鼻合作社浪费饲草，这些缺点也都受到了社外农民的批评。
    合作社的问题暴露出来了，社员和社外农民都关心这些问题的解决。今年夏季有的合作社整顿后，提出的问题没有得到解决，使社员很失望。接受过去的教训，对于这次揭发出来的问题，工作组和支部都认真作了处理。总的说来，这次整社主要解决了以下几方面的问题：
    第一，贯彻执行了自愿互利政策。土地未评产的合作社，把土地分等划类，组织评议小组进行了评产。评产不当的合作社，结合粮食“三定”工作进行了调整。股份金缴纳办法不当的合作社，都改为按土地六、劳力四的比例缴纳。农具入社问题处理不当的合作社，这次规定农具价按股份金分摊，并明确规定了偿还期限。
    第二，纯洁了合作社的组织，调整了合作社的领导成份。在整社中间，对于破坏合作社的地主分子史怀恩等二人，已依法惩办；并把地主、富农分子的破坏合作社的事实大张旗鼓地进行了揭发，使群众提高警惕。两乡共有社务委员九十三人，原来贫农和新老下中农共有五十三人，占社干部总数的百分之五十七；经过调整，现在贫农和新老下中农的社干部共有七十二人，占社干部总数的百分之七十七。
    第三，改进了经营管理。在窝工浪费问题严重的合作社，实行了按件记工的办法。农具保管使用制度不好的合作社建立了农具保管使用制度。耕畜饲养不好的合作社改进了饲养制度。通过整顿劳动组织，批评了某些劳动不好的社员，表扬了积极劳动的社员。
    由于在整社过程中充分发扬了民主，体现了“大家社大家办”的精神，社员们的生产热情更加高涨起来。合作社在生产上作出了显著的成绩。两个乡的二千八百六十八亩小麦，全部适时下种。为了作到细收细打，各个合作社组织了拣粮小组。整社以后，两个乡又进行了生产规划，为两个乡的发展生产指出了明确的方向。这样，合作社的影响更加扩大了，社外群众纷纷要求入社。两乡要求入社的农民共九十户，现已吸收入社的有六十一户。
