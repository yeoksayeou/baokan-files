The Seventh Patient Murdered

In October 1954, in the white delivery room of the Xuanen County Hospital in Hubei Province, lay a woman named Qin Chunlan, a peasant woman from Zhongbao Township on the edge of town, who was suffering from a difficult labor. Initial diagnosis indicated that a caesarean section could save the mother.

A person in a white surgical gown walked in. Without even looking at the pregnant woman, he took out obstetrical forceps and, without properly disinfecting them, forcefully struck at the woman's cervix. The woman fainted from the pain. The baby was taken out, but the operation was not finished. The "doctor" threw down the surgical gown and went upstairs in a puff of smoke. Immediately following that, the doctor's laughter could be heard from upstairs.

In the midst of this laughter, the woman's uterus ruptured due to the forceps, causing unstoppable bleeding. The assistant midwife cried out anxiously:

"Doctor Wan, come quickly! Why did you leave before the operation was finished?!"

"It's alright," "Doctor" Wan Tifu replied absentmindedly, and told a doctor who didn't know how to perform surgery to clean up the operating table. The doctor had barely left when the woman stopped breathing.

This woman was the eighth patient sent from Zhongbao Township, and the seventh to be murdered. These assassination crimes of the "doctor" aroused widespread anger among the peasants of Zhongbao Township, and they wrote letters to the County Supervisory Committee to accuse him.

The County Supervisory Committee telephoned Gong Shunrong, the head of the County Health Department:

"Please send the medical records from the hospital tomorrow morning. We need to investigate something."

Gong Shunrong's face changed. He put down the phone and hurriedly called Wan Tifu:

"There's a problem! Quickly fabricate the medical records. They need to be sent to the Supervisory Committee tomorrow morning."

After deceiving the comrades of the Supervisory Committee with the false medical records, Director Gong paced back and forth in his office. He was very excited. But suddenly he was called to answer the phone.

"This is Gong Shunrong. County Court? Ah, Lao Tian! What's the matter? Ah! Ah! A large group of peasants came to file a complaint? Against whom? The hospital? No, they're accusing the traditional Chinese medicine practitioner Qin Zhangjian! Ha, ha, good, that's it, I'll bring the prescription deposit slip right over."

The excited smile disappeared from the director's face, replaced by a sinister expression. He called in a doctor and roared:

"Go to the Chengguan TCM United Clinic and immediately bring Qin Zhangjian here!"

Qin Zhangjian arrived quickly.

"How are you doing things! Your hands and feet aren't clean, and people have gone to the court to accuse you!" He reprimanded him sternly, then softened his tone and offered advice to his "subordinate":

"Luo Bingqing's father is making the most noise. You quickly go back and get a prescription deposit slip. I have a way to deal with it."

More than ten minutes later, Qin Zhangjian delivered the prescription deposit slip. Gong Shunrong immediately brought him into the room. Several nervous doctors were gathered in the room, including Wan Tifu and Dong Wenbin, the head of the TCM Department... Qin Zhangjian took out the slip, and the group analyzed and researched each ingredient one by one until they were convinced that there were no problems. Then they handed it to Gong Shunrong and said:

"It's foolproof, it won't give us away!"

Gong Shunrong took the slip with satisfaction, and, taking "technical appraiser" Dong Wenbin, rushed to the County Court.

We're Going to Enshi to Appeal

People filled the courtyard of the court. There were Party branch secretaries from Zhongbao and Baoqing Townships, Luo Weizhen from Zhongbao Township, Zhang Hanqing from Baoqing Township, and old man Chen Chuansong and woman Zhang Lianying from the same townships, a total of a dozen furious people. Luo Weizhen was Luo Bingqing's father. Luo Bingqing was an excellent young man who became a militiaman during the land reform. In 1950, he was very active in struggling against Qin Zhangjian, a local tyrant who had been a puppet Baochang (village head) for ten years, owed two blood debts, and raped women, and who had participated in riots and burned peasant houses after liberation. He dragged Qin Zhangjian out of his house and found the guns that Qin Zhangjian had prepared for the riot behind the house. Therefore, Qin Zhangjian hated him to death. Last spring, Luo Bingqing caught a cold and went to Qin Zhangjian for treatment. Qin Zhangjian, who had already wormed his way into the TCM United Clinic as a doctor, saw a good opportunity for revenge. He pretended to care and personally examined Luo Bingqing and prescribed medicine. After Luo Bingqing took the medicine, he died within a few days. After his death, his whole body was covered in black and purple marks, and even his teeth were black. Zhang Hanqing was Zhang Liangao's nephew. Zhang Liangao was a well-known pediatrician in Xuanen County who had cured countless sick children and often exposed Qin Zhangjian's crimes. The tyrant Qin Zhangjian therefore harbored hatred for him. When Zhang Liangao fell ill last year, he invited him to see a doctor. Qin Zhangjian took advantage of Zhang Liangao's severe illness and inability to distinguish medicines, prescribed a counter-acting medicine, and took out poisonous pills from his body and ground them up for Zhang Liangao to eat. Zhang Liangao immediately bled from his nostrils and anus, and coughed up black phlegm and black water. He died the next day. The peasant woman Zhang Lianying came to accuse Qin Zhangjian of blinding both eyes of her five-year-old daughter. Old man Chen Chuansong, who was over seventy years old, came to accuse Qin Zhangjian of killing his daughter-in-law and almost poisoning his grandson to death. Other people came to the court to accuse Qin Zhangjian of using counter-acting drugs to kill their beloved wives, young and strong sons, and newborn babies.

Gong Shunrong, with "technical appraiser" Dong Wenbin, walked into the court with an air of authority. Without even looking at the crowd, he made contact with Tian Qingyu, the vice president of the court. After whispering for a while, they announced the official reception of the people.

The family members of the victims began their accusations in anger.

Old man Luo Weizhen recounted in one breath the process by which the tyrant Qin Zhangjian killed his son. "I demand that the People's Court arrest the assassin Qin Zhangjian and avenge my son..." Before the old man finished speaking, Vice President Tian stood up and asked:

"What evidence do you have?"

"The death of the person is the evidence! Who would save the medicine list or jar after someone died?"

"But we have evidence!" Director Gong said, with a sneer, he took out the prescription deposit slip from his pocket, waved it in front of the crowd, and handed it to Dong Wenbin, saying:

"This is the prescription deposit slip that Qin Zhangjian has on file with our health department. Let Doctor Dong appraise it and see if there are any problems."

"It's a completely edible prescription, there's nothing wrong with it," Doctor Dong deliberately looked at the slip for a long time, pretending to be serious, and said.

"Nonsense!" Old man Luo Weizhen couldn't bear it any longer, snatched the slip, and said angrily: "This slip is fake! Originally, I stamped the slip, but there's no stamp on this one; originally, there were horizontal lines on the slip, but there are no horizontal lines on this one; originally, the color of the slip was yellowish, but this one is white. This is completely a forged slip!"

Director Gong and Doctor Dong were speechless. Vice President Tian quickly stood up and roared:

"Luo Weizhen has no evidence, we can't accept it, we'll investigate the others later."

"Qin Zhangjian is a tyrant, a counter-revolutionary!" the crowd shouted:

"You're protecting the counter-revolutionaries. If you don't deal with it, hand the person over. We'll take him back and deal with him ourselves!"

Gong Shunrong panicked and stood up to resist:

"You can't take him back! Qin Zhangjian is the director of the County Health Association. To arrest him, you have to go through our health department. You're violating the law by attacking TCM, you'll be punished in the future!"

"Alright, if you say you won't deal with it, we'll go to Enshi (the location of the special district) to appeal!" The crowd left indignantly.

Not long after the crowd left, Vice President Tian of the court called Huang Jing, the comrade specifically in charge of handling Qin Zhangjian's case, and instructed:

"This afternoon, you will go to the Chengguan TCM United Clinic to attend a meeting. As for what to do, Director Gong will tell you."

Comrade Huang Jing went to the meeting place of the Chengguan TCM United Clinic without knowing what was going on. He saw that the room was full of people wearing "cross" badges. It was said that they were all directors of the health associations of each district, all of whom were practitioners of TCM.

Director Gong Shunrong announced the start of the meeting. He took out the forged prescription deposit slip, put it in front of everyone, and said:

"This is a prescription that Qin Zhangjian wrote. Today, we've specifically convened a meeting to ask everyone to appraise it and see if it can be taken. Is there any problem?"

The directors wearing "cross" badges took it and passed it around, then said in unison:

"It can be taken, it can be taken, there's no problem."

"That's good!" Gong Shunrong did not hide his excitement:

"Comrade Huang from the court is also here. Please sign your names so that we can formally close the case with the higher authorities."

They Originally Had a Different Background

On the meeting table of the Xuanen County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party lay a letter from the "Enshi Daily" that read:

"We have received letters of accusation from the people of Zhongbao Township in the first district of Xuanen, accusing counter-revolutionary element Qin Zhangjian of repeatedly assassinating the lives of peasants under the guise of 'TCM,' and describing the extremely suspicious attitude of individual responsible personnel of the County Court and Health Department towards the accusing masses. In addition to reporting to the leaders of the Regional Committee and the Special District for handling, we hope that the county leaders and relevant departments will thoroughly investigate the suspicious personnel."

The responsible comrades of the County Committee, the County People's Government, and the County Public Security Bureau gathered around the table and, after repeated studies, decided to immediately establish a "special task force" and thoroughly investigate the suspicious behavior of the relevant personnel.

The investigation revealed that they were a group of people with different backgrounds.

The matter can be traced back seven years, to the winter of 1948.

At that time, Hubei had not yet been liberated. But the sound of the Huaihai Campaign had already begun to shake the small county town of Yicheng in Hubei.

Gong Shunrong, a Kuomintang secret agent who joined the special service organization in 1939, felt somewhat uneasy in his position as director of the inspection office. He was uneasy every day. Just then, he received a letter from Da Xiangzhuang, the old superior who introduced him to the Kuomintang secret service:

"Ups and downs are normal. This is just a temporary change in the situation. You must restrain yourself and remain loyal." He also instructed:

"Hurry to the communist district in northern Hubei to understand the enemy's situation and report to me so that you are prepared. If the situation deteriorates, go to Enshi and withdraw to Sichuan and then Kunming. If you don't have time, you can contact ××× in Fancheng and act accordingly. Concealment is strength, don't fight blindly, don't act blindly, we will meet again!"

Due to the rapid development of the revolutionary situation, Gong Shunrong did not have time to infiltrate the liberated areas of northern Hubei. After January 1949, Gong Shunrong used his intellectual appearance to fraudulently obtain a letter of introduction from the Yicheng County People's Government and mixed into the Xiangxi branch of the Jianghan Public School in Dangyang Fourth District for study. After being assigned to Xuanen, he used double-dealing tactics to successively serve as the civil affairs assistant in the Third District and the district chief of the Fourth District. In July 1953, he stole the position of Director of the Health Department.

Organized a Counter-Revolutionary Murderous Gang

As soon as special agent Gong Shunrong entered the Health Department, he won over Wan Tifu, a counter-revolutionary element who was originally hidden in the hospital; then he collected a large number of counter-revolutionary elements wearing the guise of Chinese and Western medicine, such as the secretary of the Kuomintang district branch, the editor of the reactionary secret society "Wentan", and Dong Wenbin, the captain of the reactionary armed forces in the Chiping riot, and placed them in various important positions in the hospital.

In August 1953, Gong Shunrong learned that Qin Zhangjian, a local tyrant and counter-revolutionary element who had just been released from the labor camp, was a practitioner of TCM. He sent a correspondent, Zhou Antai, to Qin Zhangjian's home, four or five miles outside the city, to bring him to his room and treat him warmly. Then, he said to Qin Zhangjian:

"The county is about to establish a Health Association and a TCM United Clinic. You are smart and have good skills. As long as you work hard, you can become the director."

Afterwards, Qin Zhangjian went out to see patients, saying that the Health Department had approved him. He also boasted about himself everywhere, saying that he had cured diseases that others could not cure when he was in the labor camp, and that the leaders in the county respected him. He also won over a group of people in TCM and attacked another group. When it came to electing the director of the Health Association, Gong Shunrong personally controlled the meeting, only mentioning technical conditions and not mentioning political conditions. In this way, Qin Zhangjian was "elected" as the director of the Xuanen County Health Association and the director of the Chengguan District Association. When the TCM United Clinic was established, he used his position as the director of the Health Association to steal the position of the director of the United Clinic. Through Qin Zhangjian, Gong Shunrong also placed some criminals who had just come out of the labor camp and people with past crimes in the health associations of each district, and most of them stole the positions of the directors of the health associations of each district.

In this way, special agent Gong Shunrong formed a counter-revolutionary murderous gang with Qin Zhangjian, Wan Tifu, and Dong Wenbin as the backbone on the front lines of Chinese and Western medicine in Xuanen County, inside and outside the hospital.

After this counter-revolutionary murderous gang, concealed under the "cross" badges, was formed, special agent Gong Shunrong often gathered these counter-revolutionary elements in the name of studying work to conduct multi-faceted counter-revolutionary political education. After this counter-revolutionary gang was initially consolidated, Gong Shunrong formally arranged assassination missions:

"We must not be intimidated by those Party members, League members, and activists. When seeing a doctor, we should have a diagnosis method for each type of person. If it's an acute illness, deal with it perfunctorily; if it's a chronic illness, simply ignore it; if there's an opportunity, get rid of one. If something happens, just say it's a technical accident."

Under the guidance of this counter-revolutionary assassination program, this group of counter-revolutionary elements launched an assassination campaign on the front lines of Chinese and Western medicine inside and outside the hospital.

Inside the hospital, since the spring of 1954, under the guise of white coats, they assassinated communist party members, the deputy platoon leader of the People's Liberation Army, veteran soldier Ma Deqing, Xuanen State Farm worker and Communist Party member Jiang Zhangquan, lime worker Li Jiaju, pregnant peasant woman Qin Chunlan from Zhongbao Township, and three children, including the child of former County People's Government Secretary Zhao. They even assassinated a newborn baby. Seven of the eight farmers who came to see a doctor from Zhongbao Township were murdered; the other was refused admission. In addition, this murderous gang also crippled a public security fighter.

These problems in the hospital aroused the anger and questioning of some upright doctors in the hospital. They demanded that the accident be investigated, but special agent Gong Shunrong suppressed them using his authority as "Director of the Health Department."

He emphasized that it was "low technology, causing accidents." This spring, the county leaders discovered that there were problems in the hospital and sent three communist party members to strengthen leadership. Gong Shunrong was in the countryside at the time. Upon hearing the news, he immediately wrote a secret letter to Wan Tifu and other counter-revolutionary elements, saying: "You are my strong arms and loyal assistants, but you are not yet experienced enough. Now the surrounding environment is bad, and some Party members have been transferred here. Be careful in your actions, and don't strike too wide a blow." After returning from the countryside, he was afraid that their assassination activities would be discovered, so he quickly arranged for concealment and retreat. He said: "Now that the number of Party and League members has increased, our ability to endure is victory." He also instructed Wan Tifu, Dong Wenbin, and others: "Prescriptions and medical records are evidence that leads to execution. Be smarter in your actions in the future. Stand firm and don't arouse suspicion." Because Wan Tifu had made the most mistakes, Gong Shunrong transferred him out of the hospital in July of this year and made him the director of the medical center in Xiaoguan District.

The main culprit in the outside assassination system of the murderous gang was the local tyrant and counter-revolutionary element Qin Zhangjian. Under the guise of "TCM" and "Clinic Director," he successively killed Luo Bingqing, a militiaman from Zhongbao, women Tian Ximei and Li Cuixiang, TCM practitioner Zhang Liangao from Baoqing, and a child under one year old from Qin Zhangming, a resident of Chengguan; he also blinded both eyes of Zhang Lianying's five-year-old daughter, a poor peasant woman from Zhongbao Township.

The people had gone to the court several times to accuse Qin Zhangjian of these bloody crimes of assassinating people (there were more than 30 accusation letters), but they were all suppressed by Tian Qingyu, a counter-revolutionary element hidden in the court who had stolen the position of vice president. Taking advantage of the opportunity when the president of the court went to the province to study, Tian Qingyu covered up the truth, colluded with Gong Shunrong, and deceived those above and those below, causing the case to be delayed.

The True Colors Were Revealed

The awakened people under the leadership of the Communist Party cannot be intimidated. After returning from the court, the families of the victims immediately wrote letters to the "Enshi Daily" to file accusations, and the newspaper transferred them to the relevant departments for serious handling and thorough investigation. With the support of the Party committee, the people's awareness has been raised and their eyes have been brightened in this great movement to eliminate counter-revolutionary elements. They exposed the heinous crimes of the counter-revolutionary murderous gang, lifted their black veil, and revealed their true colors. Now, the public security department has arrested and brought to justice the leaders and backbone members of this gang.

    “十”字证章掩盖下的反革命杀人黑帮
    王文华　胡则丘
    第七个被害死的病人
    一九五四年十月，在湖北省宣恩县卫生院白色的产房里，躺着一位名叫覃春兰的难产的产妇。她是刚从城边中堡乡抬来的贫农妇女。经初步诊断，开刀取出小孩，大人可以救活。
    一个穿着白色手术衣服的人走了进来。他看也不看产妇一眼，拿出动产钳，也没有好好消一下毒，就使劲往产妇的子宫口击去。产妇痛得昏了过去。婴儿取出来了，但手术并没有完，医生就把手术衣一丢，一蹓烟上楼去了。楼上紧接着传来这位医生哈哈的笑声。
    就在这笑声中，产妇的子宫因被产钳凿击破裂而血流不止。助产护士急得大喊：
    “万医生，快来呀！怎么手术没动完就走啦？！”
    “不要紧，”万体福“医生”心不在焉地答着，就叫一位不会动手术的医生去收了手术摊子。医生刚出门不久，产妇就断气了。
    这位产妇是中堡乡送来的第八个病人，也是第七个被害死的病人。医生的这些暗杀罪行激起了中堡乡农民的普遍愤怒，他们纷纷写信到县监察委员会去控告。
    县监察委员会打电话通知县卫生科长龚顺榕：
    “你们明天早晨把卫生院的病历表送来，我们有事要检查。”
    龚顺榕脸色变了，放下电话，他连忙把万体福叫了来：
    “出问题啦！赶快造病历，明早晨就要送到监委会去。”
    用假病历骗过了监委会的同志以后，龚科长在他自己的办公室里踱来踱去。他很兴奋。但是忽然又传来找他接电话的声音。
    “我龚顺榕，县法院吗？呵，老田！什么事？啊！啊！来了大批农民，控告？控告谁？卫生院？不是，控告中医覃章鉴！呵，呵，好，就这样，我拿着处方存单就来。”
    兴奋的笑容在这位科长的脸上消失了，剩下的是阴森森的狰狞面目。他叫来一位医生，吼着：
    “到城关中医联合诊所，马上给我把覃章鉴找来！”
    覃章鉴很快就来到了。
    “你们都是怎么干的！手脚不干不净的，让人家到法院控告你来了！”他声色俱厉地训斥了一顿，马上又和缓下来，给“下属”出主意：
    “罗炳青他爹闹得最凶，你赶快回去开个处方存单来，我自有办法。”
    十多分钟以后，覃章鉴送处方存单来了。龚顺榕马上把他接到房里。这时房里聚集了几个神色紧张的医生，其中有万体福，有中医室负责人董文彬……。覃章鉴把单子拿出来，几个人就一味药一味药进行分析研究，直到认为完全没有问题了，才交给龚顺榕，说：
    “保险，露不了马脚！”
    龚顺榕满意地拿了单子，又带着“技术鉴定人”董文彬，急急忙忙来到了县法院。
    我们到恩施上告去
    法院门口站满了人。有中堡、保庆两乡的党支部书记，有中堡乡的罗维真、保庆乡的张汉清，还有同乡老头谌传松、妇女张莲英等，一共十几个怒不可遏的群众。罗维真就是罗炳青的父亲。罗炳青是个顶棒的小伙子，土地改革时就当民兵。在一九五○年斗争那当了十年伪保长、有血债二条、强奸过妇女，解放后又参加过暴动、烧毁过农民房屋的恶霸覃章鉴时，他顶积极。他把覃章鉴从屋里拖出来，又在屋后面搜出了覃章鉴准备暴动的枪支。因此覃章鉴恨死了他。去年春上，罗炳青受了点凉，去覃章鉴那里看病。覃章鉴当时已经钻进中医联合诊所当了医生，一看报仇的好机会到了，就假装关心，亲自给罗炳青看病、抓药。罗炳青吃了药以后，不几天就死去了；死后全身乌一块、紫一块，连牙齿都是黑的。张汉清是张连高的侄儿。张连高是宣恩县有名的小儿科医生，曾经医好过无数生病的小孩，平时也揭发过覃章鉴的罪恶。恶霸覃章鉴因此怀恨在心。去年张连高害病时接他去看病，他就趁张连高病重失去辨别医药能力时，下了一副反药，又从身上摸出一颗颗毒药丸磨给张连高吃了，张连高当即鼻孔、肛门四下出血，口吐黑痰黑水，第二天就死去了。贫农妇女张莲英是来控告覃章鉴害瞎了她五岁女孩一双眼睛。七十多岁的谌传松老汉是来控告覃章鉴害死了他的儿媳妇，又下毒手几乎害死了他留下的一个孙子。其他群众都是要向法院控告，控告覃章鉴下反药害死自己心爱的妻子，年轻力壮的儿子和刚刚生下的婴儿。
    龚顺榕带着“技术鉴定人”董文彬神气十足地走进了法院，看也不看群众一眼，就和法院副院长田清毓接了头。两人叽咕了一阵，就宣布正式接待群众。
    被害家属们一个个愤怒地控诉开了。
    罗维真老汉一口气诉述了恶霸覃章鉴害死他儿子的经过。“我要求人民法院逮捕暗杀人的覃章鉴，给我儿子报仇……”老汉的话还没有讲完，田副院长就站起来问道：
    “你有什么证据？”
    “害死了人就是证据！人死了那有人保存药单药罐的？”
    “那我们可有证据！”龚科长一边说，一边连声冷笑着从口袋里拿出那张墨迹未干的处方存单，在群众面前晃了晃，又递给董文彬，说：
    “这就是覃章鉴存在我们卫生科的处方存单，给董医生鉴定鉴定，你看有什么问题没有？”
    “完全是能吃的单子，没有一味不合适的”，董医生故意把单子看了半天，装模作样地说着。
    “胡说！”罗维真老汉早就忍不住了，一手抢过单子来，愤怒地说：“这单子是假的！原来我在存单上盖了章的，这单上没有章；原来单上有横格格，这单上没有横格格；原来单子的颜色是黄黄的，这单子是白白的。这完全是张假造的单子！”
    龚科长和董医生都张口结舌说不出话来。田副院长连忙站起来吼道：
    “罗维真没凭没据，我们不能受理，其他的调查调查再说。”
    “覃章鉴是恶霸，是反革命！”群众接过去就吼起来了：
    “你们包庇反革命，你们不处理，把人交出来，我们带回去自有法子处理！”
    龚顺榕慌了，站起来抵抗道：
    “抓回去不行！覃章鉴是县卫生协会主任，要抓非通过我们卫生科不行。你们打击中医是犯法的，将来要反判几个！”
    “好，只要你们说了不处理，我们到恩施（专署所在地）上告去！”群众愤愤不平地走了。
    群众走后不久的一个下午，法院田副院长把具体处理覃章鉴案件的黄静同志找来，吩咐道：
    “你今天下午到城关中医联合诊所去参加一个会议。至于做些什么，龚科长会告诉你”。
    黄静同志不摸头脑地走进了城关中医联合诊所的会场，只见满屋坐的都是些带着“十”字证章的人，据说是各区卫生协会的主任，都是中医。
    龚顺榕科长宣布开会了。他又把那张假造的处方存单拿出来，摆在大家面前说：
    “这是覃章鉴开的一个药单子，今天专门开个会请大家来鉴定鉴定，看究竟吃得吃不得。有没有问题？”
    挂着“十”字证章的主任们接过去传看了看，然后异口同声地说：
    “吃得，吃得，没有什么问题。”
    “那就好了！”龚顺榕并不掩盖他的兴奋：
    “法院黄同志也在这里，就请大家签个名吧，好呈报上级正式结案。”
    原来他们别有来历
    在中共宣恩县委会的会议桌上，放着一份从“恩施报”来的公函，上面写着：
    “我们收到了宣恩一区中堡乡群众写来的控告信件，控告反革命分子覃章鉴披着‘中医’外衣屡次暗害农民生命，并叙述了县法院和卫生科个别负责人员对待控告群众的极其可疑的态度。我们除报告地委、专署首长处理外，希望县领导有关部门对可疑人员彻底进行追查。”
    县委、县人民政府、县公安局的负责同志们围在桌旁，反复研究之后，决定马上成立“专案小组”，并彻底追查有关人员的可疑行为。
    追查的结果，原来他们是一伙别有来历的人物。
    事情要追溯到七年以前，一九四八年的冬天。
    那时湖北还没有解放。但是淮海战役的炮声已经开始震撼着湖北宜城这个小小的县城。
    一九三九年就参加了特务组织的军统特务龚顺榕在他的稽查处主任的位置上也有些坐不稳了，他成天心神不宁。正在这时，他接到介绍他加入军统的老上级答相桩的来信：
    “一起一伏，理之常也。这不过是时局的一时变化，你必须克苦自持，忠贞不二。”又布置：
    “赶快去鄂北共区，了解敌情，向我汇报，以便做到有准备。如情况恶化，速来恩施，同退四川转昆明。万一来不及，可去樊城与×××联系行事。潜伏就是力量，千万不要硬拚，盲动，后会有期！”
    由于革命形势发展得快，龚顺榕来不及打入鄂北解放区。一九四九年一月以后，龚顺榕以知识分子的面貌骗取了宜城县人民政府的介绍信，到当阳四分区混进江汉公学襄西分校学习。以后分配来宣恩，他利用两面派手法，先后当了三区民政助理和四区区长，一九五三年七月窃取了卫生科长的职位。
    组织了反革命杀人黑帮
    特务龚顺榕一进卫生科，就拉拢了原来暗藏在卫生院的反革命分子万体福；接着又搜罗了国民党区分部书记、反动会道门“文坛”主笔，墀坪暴动中反动武装中队长董文彬等大批披着中西医外衣的反革命分子，把他们安插到卫生院的各个重要环节上。
      一九五三年的八月，龚顺榕打听到一个刚从劳改队释放出来的恶霸，反革命分子覃章鉴是中医，就派通讯员周安太到城外四、五里地覃章鉴家里把他找了来，接到自己房里热情款待，然后对覃章鉴说：
    “县里马上要成立卫生协会和中医联合诊所。你人聪明，技术不错，只要努力活动，可以当主任。”
    以后，覃章鉴就出去给人看病，说是卫生科批准了他。他又到处吹嘘自己，说他在劳改队的时候别人治不了的病他治好了，县里领导上都看得起他。他又在中医中拉拢一批，打击一批。到选举卫生协会主任时，龚顺榕又亲自去掌握会场，只提技术条件，不提政治条件。这样，覃章鉴就被“选”上了宣恩县卫生协会主任和城关区协会主任。到成立中医联合诊所时，又利用卫生协会主任的职权窃取了联合诊所主任的职位。龚顺榕通过覃章鉴又把一些刚从劳改队出来的罪犯和历史上有罪恶的人安插到各区卫生协会，大都窃取了各区卫生协会主任的职务。
      这样，特务头子龚顺榕就在宣恩县的中西医卫生战线上，在卫生院内外，组成了以覃章鉴、万体福、董文彬为骨干的反革命杀人黑帮。
    这个在“十”字证章掩盖下的反革命杀人黑帮形成以后，特务头子龚顺榕就经常以研究工作为名，召集这些反革命分子进行多方面的反革命政治教育。等这个反革命黑帮初步巩固以后，龚顺榕就正式布置暗害任务：
    “我们不要被那些党员、团员、积极分子所吓倒。看病时我们对哪号人应有哪号诊法。是急病就敷衍一下，是慢性病干脆不理；有机会就干掉一个，出了事就说是技术事故。”
    在这条反革命暗杀纲领的指导下，这群反革命分子就在院内院外中西医战线上展开了暗杀活动。
    在卫生院内，从一九五四年春季以来，他们在白色外衣的掩盖下，暗害死了共产党员、解放军副排长、转业军人马德清、宣恩国营农场工人、共产党员姜章全、石灰工人李家驹、中堡乡贫农产妇覃春兰，还有前县人民政府赵秘书的小孩等三个小孩，甚至还暗害了一个刚刚落地的婴儿。中堡乡八个农民来看病，被害死七个；另一个被拒绝收留。此外，这个杀人黑帮还把一个公安战士害得残废了。
      卫生院出了这些问题，早引起院内一些正直医生的愤怒和质问。他们纷纷要求追查事故，但都被特务龚顺榕利用“卫生科长”的职权压制下去了。
    他强调是“技术不高、造成事故”。今年春天，县领导上发现卫生院有问题，先后派去三名共产党员加强领导。龚顺榕那时正在乡下，听到这消息，立即写密信给万体福等反革命分子说：“你们是我有力的臂膀，忠实的助手，但你们毕竟还不够老练。现在周围环境恶劣，又调来一些党员。千万要小心行事，打击面不要太宽。”从乡下回来以后，他害怕他们的暗害活动被发现，赶快布置隐蔽和退却。他说：“现在党团员增多了，我们能忍耐就是胜利。”又向万体福、董文彬等布置：“处方和病历是杀头的证据，你们以后作事要聪明些，要站稳脚跟，别引起别人怀疑。”因为万体福露马脚最多，龚顺榕在今年七月就把他调离卫生院，到晓关区当医务所长。
    杀人黑帮院外暗害系统的主要凶手，就是恶霸反革命分子覃章鉴。他在“中医”、“诊所主任”的掩盖下，先后害死了中堡民兵罗炳青、妇女田细妹、李翠香、保庆中医张连高、城关居民覃章明的一个未满周岁的小孩；还害瞎了中堡乡贫农妇女张莲英五岁女孩的一双眼睛。
    覃章鉴暗害人命的这些血腥罪行，群众曾几次到法院控告（控告信有三十多件），都被暗藏在法院、窃取了副院长职位的反革命分子田清毓压下了。田清毓趁正院长去省学习的机会，一手遮天，同龚顺榕串通一气，瞒上欺下，使案件一直拖搁下来。
    原形露出来了
    在共产党领导下的觉悟了的人民群众是吓不倒的。被害家属们从法院回去以后，立即写信到“恩施报”社进行控告，报社转请有关部门严肃处理，彻底追查。在党委的支持下，在这次伟大的肃清反革命分子的运动中，群众觉悟提高了，眼睛擦亮了，纷纷揭露反革命杀人黑帮的滔天罪行。揭开了他们的黑幕，使他们露出了原形。现在，公安部门已经把这个黑帮的头子和骨干分子逮捕法办了。
