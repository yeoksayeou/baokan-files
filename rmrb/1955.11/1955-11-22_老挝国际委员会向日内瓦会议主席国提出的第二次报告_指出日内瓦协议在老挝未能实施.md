　　Xinhua News Agency, November 22nd: The International Commission of Laos recently submitted its second working report to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference—the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom. The report describes the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Laos from January to June 1955 and the work of the Commission. This report has been distributed by the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference to the participating countries of the Geneva Conference.
    The report points out that according to the explicit provisions of the Geneva Accords, both sides in Laos should cease all hostilities from August 6, 1954. However, in fact, in the provinces of Sam Neua and Phong Saly, this provision was not implemented. On March 9th of this year, the Royal Lao side and the Pathet Lao Fighting Units side reached an agreement to cease armed conflict in the provinces of Sam Neua and Phong Saly. In the agreement, the Royal side "guaranteed not to repeat any hostile acts of any nature against the Pathet Lao Fighting Units, especially military operations." However, this agreement was not observed. After March 9th of this year, armed conflicts continued to occur in the provinces of Sam Neua and Phong Saly. In the report, the International Commission of Laos repeatedly emphasized that both sides should immediately cease hostilities in the two provinces in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Accords.
    The report mentions that, at the suggestion of the International Commission, both sides in Laos convened a political conference on January 18th of this year. On January 19th, both sides issued a joint statement expressing their willingness to "jointly implement the Geneva Accords, consolidate peace, bring freedom and democracy to the people, and achieve unity and national independence." In this joint statement, both sides also stated: "Will seek all possible ways to resolve all issues related to national independence through consultation, in order to achieve satisfactory results." However, the Royal side withdrew from the political conference on April 25th, causing the conference to be interrupted. On June 4th, the International Commission wrote to both sides, expressing concern about the obstruction of the political settlement in Laos, and requested both sides to resume negotiations and continue consultations to seek the early realization of a political settlement. In the letter, the International Commission also stated that if both sides were willing, the International Commission was ready to provide mediation for the settlement of the political issues in Laos at any time.
    The report shows that the International Commission encountered difficulties in supervising the implementation of the provisions of the Geneva Accords concerning the prohibition of the introduction of reinforcing war materials into Laos. For example, the Royal Lao Government did not, in accordance with the decision of the International Commission, report on a monthly basis the situation of war materials transported into Laos in the previous month, and the quantity, time, and location of war materials expected to be transported into Laos in the current month.

　　老挝国际委员会向日内瓦会议主席国提出的第二次报告
　　指出日内瓦协议在老挝未能实施
    新华社二十二日讯　最近，老挝国际委员会向日内瓦会议两主席国——苏联和英国提出了第二次工作报告。报告叙述了一九五五年一月至六月在老挝实施日内瓦协议的情况和委员会的工作。这个报告已经由日内瓦会议两主席国分发给日内瓦会议的参加国。
    报告指出：根据日内瓦协议的明文规定，老挝双方应该从一九五四年八月六日起停止一切敌对行为。但是事实上在桑怒和丰沙里两省，这一规定并没有被实施。今年三月九日，老挝王国方面和寮国战斗部队方面曾达成了在桑怒、丰沙里两省停止武装冲突的协议。在协议中王国方面“保证不许重演对寮国战斗部队的任何性质的敌对行为，特别是军事行动”。但是，这一协议又没有被遵守。今年三月九日以后，在桑怒和丰沙里两省还是不断发生武装冲突。老挝国际委员会在报告中一再强调双方应该按照日内瓦协议的规定，立即停止在两省的敌对行为。
    报告提到：在国际委员会建议之下，老挝双方今年一月十八日召开了政治会议。一月十九日，双方曾发表了联合声明，表示愿意“共同履行日内瓦协议，巩固和平，给人民带来自由和民主，实现统一和达到国家独立”。在这个联合声明中，双方并且表示：“将寻求一切可能的办法，通过协商解决一切有关国家独立的问题，以期取得圆满的结果。”但是，王国方面在四月二十五日退出了政治会议，使会议陷于中断。六月四日，国际委员会写信给双方，对老挝政治解决的遭受阻挠表示忧虑，要求双方恢复谈判，继续进行协商，以寻求政治解决的早日实现。国际委员会在信中并且表示：如果双方愿意的话，国际委员会随时都准备为老挝政治问题的解决提供斡旋。
    报告表明：在监督实施日内瓦协议有关禁止把增援性作战物资运入老挝的规定方面，国际委员会遭到了困难。例如，老挝王国政府并没有按照国际委员会的决定，逐月报告上月份运入老挝的作战物资的情况，和本月份预计运入老挝的作战物资的数量、时间和地点。
