Shanxi Province's Department of Public Health, in order to coordinate with the rapid development of the agricultural cooperative movement, has decided to complete the training of 25,000 agricultural production cooperative health workers before the spring plowing next year. At the same time, in agricultural production cooperatives with a relatively good foundation and more than 50 households, health rooms will be established in a planned manner.

In order to adapt to the needs of the development of agricultural cooperativization, Shanxi Province's Department of Public Health began to rectify health centers and clinics last year. It also built 50 new health clinics in mountainous areas, expanded one health center, and established a number of joint clinics. Furthermore, through the Health Workers Association, public and private medical and health forces were generally mobilized to serve the agricultural cooperative movement. At present, more than 1,300 public and private health and medical institutions in the province have signed prevention and health contracts with nearby agricultural cooperatives, and carry out mobile medical services with a focus on agricultural cooperatives and remote mountainous areas. Most counties in the Changzhi, Jinan, Yuci, and Xinxian special districts have implemented a rural health work district responsibility system, which ensures that every rural area and every agricultural cooperative has a doctor or health worker responsible for health care.

    山西加强农村的卫生工作
    山西省卫生厅为了配合农业合作化运动的迅速发展，决定在明年春耕前完成二万五千名农业生产合作社保健员的训练任务；同时在基础较好的五十户以上的农业生产合作社，有步骤地建立保健室。
    为了适应农业合作化发展需要，山西省卫生厅从去年起即开始对卫生院和卫生所进行整顿，并在山区新建了五十个卫生所，扩建了一座卫生院，成立了一批联合诊所，又在定襄等五县试行改进农村卫生组织。同时，通过卫生工作者协会，普遍动员公私医药卫生力量，为农业合作化运动服务。目前全省已有一千三百多个公私卫生医疗机构同附近农业社订立预防保健合同，并以农业社和边远山区为重点开展巡回医疗。长治、晋南、榆次、忻县等专区大部分县实行了农村卫生工作地段负责制，这样就使每个农村、每个农业社都有医生或卫生人员负责卫生保健工作。　　（倪合一）
