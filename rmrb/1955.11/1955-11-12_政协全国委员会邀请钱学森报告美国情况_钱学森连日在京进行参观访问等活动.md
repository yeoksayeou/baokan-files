The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) held a lecture meeting in Beijing on the 11th, inviting the renowned Chinese scientist Qian Xuesen, who recently returned from the United States, to report on the current situation in the United States.

The lecture meeting was presided over by Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman of the CPPCC National Committee. Those attending included CPPCC National Committee members in Beijing, National People's Congress representatives in Beijing, members of the National Defense Council, central committee members of various democratic parties, cadres from various offices and directly affiliated units of the State Council, as well as staff from other government agencies, organizations, and universities, totaling more than 1,500 people.

This newspaper reports: The renowned scientist Qian Xuesen, who recently returned from the United States, has been continuously engaged in visits and activities in Beijing for the past half-month.

Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, held a welcoming banquet for Qian Xuesen upon his return to Beijing. At the banquet, Qian Xuesen had a warm exchange with responsible staff members from various departments of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and renowned scientists from the capital. During the conversation, Qian Xuesen gained a preliminary understanding of the progress of scientific research work in the motherland in recent years; he expressed his intention to learn from the active and diligent spirit of the scientists of the motherland.

On November 5th, Chen Yi, Vice Premier of the State Council, received Qian Xuesen. During the meeting, Qian Xuesen spoke about the situation of Chinese students in the United States, especially their strong desire to return to the motherland.

On the evening of November 5th, Qian Xuesen excitedly participated in the Chinese Academy of Sciences' celebration of the 38th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution and delivered a speech. He said: In the short time since returning to the country, he has already felt the significant changes in the motherland and witnessed the strong support of the People's Government for scientific research work and the rapid progress of scientific undertakings and other aspects of construction. He pointed out that this is inseparable from the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and the assistance of the Soviet Union.

After arriving in Beijing, Qian Xuesen visited research units such as the Institute of Applied Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and also visited universities such as Peking University, Tsinghua University, Central University for Nationalities, and Central Conservatory of Music. During his visit to Peking University, Peking University President Ma Yinchu held a welcoming banquet.

After carefully inspecting the factory workshops, he also visited the employee dormitories and canteens, as well as the employee children's primary school and nursery facilities. He also visited the "Yellow River Harnessing Exhibition," the "National Ceramics Exhibition," and the "Dunhuang Murals Exhibition"; he was deeply moved by the great plan for harnessing the Yellow River.

Qian Xuesen told reporters that through half a month of visits and activities, first, he has seen that the motherland is carrying out socialist construction, but the scale of this undertaking is larger than he had previously imagined; second, almost every unit leader he has visited has talked to him about the need for technical talent, so he deeply feels the importance of cultivating new forces in his future work, and he said that at the same time, efforts should be made to encourage overseas students to return to the motherland as soon as possible to participate in construction.

Before formally starting work, Qian Xuesen will also go to the Northeast for visits and activities.
