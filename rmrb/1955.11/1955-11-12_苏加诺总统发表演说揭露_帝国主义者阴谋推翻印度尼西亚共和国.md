Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, November 11th: According to Bandung newspapers, on November 10th, Indonesia's "Heroes' Day" – the tenth anniversary of Indonesia's defense war in Surabaya against British and Dutch troops, President Sukarno delivered a speech at a ceremony in Bandung commemorating the martyrs of the independence struggle. He said that he had obtained sufficient documentary evidence to prove the imperialists' conspiracy and subversive activities to overthrow the Republic of Indonesia. One of their current conspiracies is to attempt to use the upcoming Constituent Assembly election to overthrow this republic.

Sukarno said that the Republic is currently in danger, just as it has been for the past decade, and he called on the Indonesian people to save and defend the Republic in the patriotic spirit of the martyrs.

Sukarno said that the documents he possesses prove that the imperialists and their lackeys in Indonesia have two plans to overthrow the Republic, one a short-term plan to be completed in about three years, and the other a long-term plan to be completed in ten to twenty years.

According to the first plan, the imperialists are attempting to weaken the Republic from within and eliminate it from without. Sukarno accused the imperialists of attempting to eliminate the Republic from the outside through negotiations and even direct attacks. In order to weaken the Republic from within, the imperialists are carrying out sabotage and divisive activities in the economic and production spheres. They are also bribing government personnel to serve them.

Regarding the long-term plan, Sukarno revealed that the imperialists and their agents are first attempting to undermine the unity of the Indonesian people. They are creating discord and division, enabling them to use our country's various ideologies to "divide and rule." Secondly, they are stirring up religious fanaticism and sectarian sentiment in Aceh and West Java to strengthen the position of armed bandits in these areas. Thirdly, they are intensifying the situation in our country by exacerbating the antagonism between various classes, religions, and political parties. Fourthly, they are creating friction within the armed forces, for example, between former Indonesian National Army personnel and former Royal Netherlands East Indies Army personnel. Fifthly, they are organizing fully equipped armies in West Java and South Sulawesi. Sixthly, they are sending special agents to infiltrate various political parties in order to control them and to sharpen the antagonism between the parties. Seventhly, with the support of foreign-capital plantations, they are publishing new newspapers and conducting propaganda to influence public opinion. Eighthly, they are attempting to turn the Republic of Indonesia into a federal republic.

Sukarno attached great importance to the parliamentary elections held on September 29th, and he emphasized that democracy is one of Indonesia's five founding principles. He said that some people are dissatisfied with the results of the election and are attempting to overturn these results under the guise of "improvement" and "rectification."

President Sukarno finally called on the people to maintain a high degree of vigilance against the dangers threatening the Republic in the upcoming elections for the Constituent Assembly and to exercise their right to vote carefully.

　　苏加诺总统发表演说揭露
　　帝国主义者阴谋推翻印度尼西亚共和国
    新华社雅加达十一日电　据万隆报纸报道，在十一月十日印度尼西亚“英雄日”——印度尼西亚在泗水抵抗英国和荷兰军队的保卫战十周年，苏加诺总统在万隆纪念独立斗争牺牲烈士的仪式上发表演说。他说，他手中已经掌握了充分的文件证据，足以证明帝国主义者企图推翻印度尼西亚共和国的阴谋和颠覆活动。他们目前的阴谋之一是企图利用即将到来的制宪议会选举来推翻这个共和国。
    苏加诺说，共和国目前正如它过去十年以来一样，正处在危险中，他号召印度尼西亚人民本着烈士们的爱国精神来拯救和保卫共和国。
    苏加诺说，他所掌握的文件证明，帝国主义者和他们在印度尼西亚的走狗们有两种推翻共和国的计划，一种是要在大约三年中完成的短期计划，另一种是规定在十年到二十年内完成的长期计划。
    根据第一种计划，帝国主义者企图从内部来削弱共和国，并且从外部来消灭共和国。苏加诺指责帝国主义者企图通过谈判以至发动直接的进攻来从外部消灭共和国。为了从内部削弱共和国，帝国主义者正在经济方面和生产上进行破坏和分裂活动。他们还贿赂政府人员去为他们效力。
    关于长期计划，苏加诺揭露说，帝国主义者和他们的代理人首先企图破坏印度尼西亚人民的团结。他们制造不和，制造分裂，使他们能够利用我们国内各种不同的意识形态来“分而治之”。其次，他们正在亚齐和西爪哇煽起宗教狂热和宗派情绪，以加强这些地区内武装匪帮的地位。第三，他们正通过使各个阶层、宗教和政党之间的对立尖锐化的方法来使我们国家的局势紧张起来。第四，在武装部队中，例如在前印度尼西亚国民军人员和前皇家荷印军人员之间制造摩擦。第五，在西爪哇和南苏拉威西组织全副装备的军队。第六，派遣特务渗入各政党以便控制它们，并且使各政党之间的对立尖锐化。第七，在外国资本的种植园的资助下，出版新的报刊，进行宣传以影响舆论。第八，企图把印度尼西亚共和国变成联邦共和国。
    苏加诺对九月二十九日举行的国会选举非常重视，他强调指出，民主是印度尼西亚五个立国原则之一。他说，有人对选举的结果不满意，并且企图在“改进”和“纠正”等借口下推翻这些结果。
    苏加诺总统最后号召人民在即将到来的制宪议会的选举中，对威胁共和国的危险保持高度的警惕，小心地行使选举权。
