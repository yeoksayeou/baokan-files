    Continue to Maintain a Sober Mind
    Wu Yaodong, Secretary of the Lishui County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Zhejiang Province
    I stayed in the Fengshan District of Lishui County for seven days and learned about the work situation in two townships. Judging from the townships in Lishui County where a high tide of the cooperative movement has already formed, many townships have exceeded the original planned targets. According to statistics from 34 townships including Liancheng and Xinxing, 32 townships have exceeded the original planned targets. For example, Liancheng Township originally planned to establish seven new cooperatives, but currently the masses are demanding the establishment of thirteen cooperatives. The number of cooperatives has exceeded the original planned target by nearly one time, and the number of households has exceeded 40 percent. Township and village cadres are busy every day processing farmers' applications to join cooperatives and meeting with farmers who want to join.
    Under this new situation, because our education and assistance to district and township cadres are not yet sufficient, they are still uncertain about some specific issues, and there are some deviations. Some cadres ignore the original planned targets and indiscriminately absorb people, regardless of whether they are poor farmers or wealthy farmers, truly voluntary or not truly voluntary, without any analysis. In Guanqiao Village, Fengjie Township, there were three wealthy middle-peasant households who were originally very indifferent to the cooperative movement. Later, they were afraid of being called backward by others and reluctantly signed up to join the cooperative, and the village cadres also absorbed them into the cooperative. In Qinglin Township, Yanquan District, two rich-peasant households requested to join the cooperative, and the cadres actually agreed to let them in (later discovered by the district committee, they have been expelled from the cooperative). In short, these townships and villages blindly accepted some people (mainly wealthy middle peasants) who should not have been absorbed or who had ideological concerns. This will inevitably affect the quality of the cooperatives and increase unnecessary difficulties for future rectification and consolidation of the cooperatives. Some cadres are also afraid that there will be “too many” people joining the cooperatives and that they “cannot lead” them, so they adopt the method of "tightly closing the cooperative doors and not absorbing anyone at all." For example, at a registration meeting held in the fifth electoral district of Bihuzhen one evening, the cadres saw that the number of registrants had reached the original planned target, so they hurriedly went on stage to announce: "Enough! Enough!" "No more registration allowed!" The registration ended there, which aroused dissatisfaction among the masses who really wanted to join the cooperative but failed to register. In Xinxing Township, Nanming District, three poor-peasant households and four newly lower-middle-peasant households repeatedly requested to join the cooperative, but they were also kept outside the cooperative doors on the grounds that "the number of households joining the cooperative is sufficient." To some wealthy middle peasants who continued to request to join the cooperative, they were simply told, "You can come again next year."
    Why do the above two phenomena occur? This is because some cadres regard some necessary controls as "rigid rules and regulations," so they accept anyone who comes. Other cadres are still afraid to boldly lead the movement. At the same time, they regard the planned targets as something that cannot be changed, so they rigidly adhere to the planned figures. Or they believe that if they act in accordance with the planned targets of the higher authorities in a proper manner, they will avoid being held responsible if something goes wrong in the future. This is the result of not combining the instructions of the higher authorities with the actual situation in the local area. Although these two phenomena are currently occurring only in individual places, they are worth paying attention to.
    So, how can we correctly lead the movement forward? I believe that every rural work cadre should master the movement in the same way that an excellent car driver masters a car. As a car driver, one must be clear-headed, calm, and hold the steering wheel correctly with both hands, driving the car both fast and steadily, with the initiative to stop or start always in the hands of the car driver. Every cadre of us should also lead the agricultural cooperation movement in this way, correctly and boldly guiding the movement forward, so that the initiative of the movement is always in our own hands. To achieve this, we must master the following points:
    Every cadre must maintain a clear head and must not let the high tide of the movement "inflate" their minds. The comrades in charge of Liancheng Township, Fengshan District, saw that many people joined the cooperative and greatly exceeded the planned targets, so they did not analyze who really wanted to join the cooperative and who only verbally requested to join the cooperative but did not really want to join or did not want to join very much, but treated all those who requested to join in the same way. This is obviously a lack of class analysis. In this case, as long as you calm down and think about it, and compare it with Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions, you will be able to figure out the details. At the same time, it is also necessary to see whether the original planned targets of the township branch are correct. If the original planned targets were conservative, then even if the planned targets are exceeded, it is not terrible, and you can ask the higher authorities to revise the planned targets. If there is no problem with the original planned targets, but the targets are exceeded, then there must be a problem with the work, and development should be stopped in a timely manner for inspection.
    In the specific work of "braking" (stopping development), problems have also occurred in individual areas of Lishui County. One is "hard braking," and the other is "braking in reverse." The so-called "hard braking" is the act of closing the cooperative doors in a panic, as mentioned above, and bolting the iron door shut. The so-called "braking in reverse" is the act of individual cadres mistakenly adopting the method of calculating accounts that are "unfavorable" to the middle peasants in the cooperative and "reducing production" for the middle peasants who join the cooperative to mobilize the middle peasants not to join the cooperative. For example, the work cadres of Jiulong Township, Bihu District, said to the activists: "You should explain to them (referring to the middle peasants) that joining the cooperative will 'reduce production.' As long as you calculate the accounts, they will naturally not come." The result of this approach will bring losses to the agricultural cooperation movement and will encourage the development of the spontaneous capitalist ideology of the wealthy middle peasants.
    So, what should be the correct "braking" method?
    Before "braking," we must do investigation work, first investigating how many poor farmers outside the cooperative should join the cooperative but have not joined, and what are the reasons for not joining. To those who should join this year, we must explain to them that if they are willing to join this year, they can still join. For example, after the expansion of the cooperative in Fengshanqian Village, Fengjie Township, it was discovered through inspection that four poor peasant households were omitted in the planning, neither included in this year's plan nor included in next year's plan. Later, it was decided to absorb two households this year and two households next year. We must also check whether there are any individual households among the farmers who have already joined the cooperative who have been forced to follow along; or have been forced to join under the compulsory orders of individual cadres. To these people, we can continue to explain the party's principle of voluntariness, which will make the quality of the cooperative more guaranteed.
    We are also never allowed to use the method of "hard braking" to treat the wealthy middle peasants. Generally speaking, the wealthy middle peasants have many concerns about their joining the cooperative, and their ideological struggle is very intense. In my discussion with five wealthy middle peasants who requested to join the cooperative but were not approved, I found that they had a contradictory psychology: on the one hand, they were afraid that joining the cooperative would "reduce income" or "not be free," and some were even afraid that "property would be divided equally." For example, Zhang Xiangxin, an old upper-middle peasant in his sixties, said: "The working comrades said that poor peasants and middle peasants are close brothers. I toss and turn all night and can't sleep. I think that joining the cooperative will always divide my land, cattle, and farm tools among the poor peasants, otherwise how can they be called close brothers?" On the other hand, they were afraid that they would not be able to hire workers outside the cooperative in the future, that they would "suffer losses" in the unified purchase, that they would not be able to buy commercial fertilizers, and some were afraid of being treated as "bad elements." As wealthy middle peasant Ye Jiayin said: "I always think about the issue of joining the cooperative, calculating this and that, and I am restless." Most people signed up to join the cooperative with a stiff upper lip because they saw that everyone else had joined the cooperative and felt isolated outside the cooperative. Later, after I explained to them the principle of voluntariness and the principle of organizing in batches, they expressed their willingness to stand outside the cooperative and watch for another year, and come again next year. Some even said that they would watch for another two years and come again the year after next. Zhang Xiangxin said: "In this way, my heart is also relieved, I can sleep peacefully, and I am also interested in working." Therefore, while "braking," we must explain the principles to the peasants outside the cooperative, especially the wealthy middle peasants, stabilize their emotions, and encourage them to actively produce and run mutual aid teams well, and strive to join the cooperative again next year. This step of work is very necessary.
    After "braking," on the one hand, we should transfer key personnel to the county for study, and on the other hand, we should quickly translate the enthusiasm of the cooperative members to run the cooperative into production, formulate and arrange small-scale production plans, and quickly achieve results in production. Only in this way can we further stabilize the emotions of the new cooperative members and make them personally experience the great power of collective production, so that they can settle down and run the cooperative.

    继续保持清醒的头脑
    中共浙江省丽水县委书记　吴耀东
    我在丽水县凤山区住了七天，了解了两个乡的工作情况。从丽水县已形成合作化运动高潮的乡看来，有很多乡突破了原定规划指标。根据联城、新兴等三十四个乡的统计，已有三十二个乡突破了原定规划指标。如联城乡原来规划办七个新社，目前群众要求办十三个社，社数超过原定规划指标将近一倍，户数超过百分之四十。乡、村干部每日忙于处理农民要求入社的申请书和接见要求入社的农民。
    在这种新的情况下，由于我们对区乡干部的教育和帮助还不够，在一些具体问题上，他们还掌握不定，有些偏差。一部分干部离开原定规划指标不管，不论贫苦农民或富裕农民，真自愿或不是真自愿，都不加分析地吸收进来。凤街乡官桥村有三户富裕中农，原来对合作化态度很冷淡，后来害怕别人说他们落后，勉强报名入社，村干部也把他们吸收入社了。岩泉区青林乡有两户富农要求入社，干部竟也同意他们进来了（后经区委发现，已清洗出社）。总之，这些乡、村把一些不应吸收的或思想上有顾虑的人（主要是富裕中农），都盲目地接收入社了。这样必然会影响合作社的质量，给今后整顿和巩固合作社工作增加了不应有的困难。还有些干部惧怕入社的人“多了”“领导不了”，因而采取“紧闭社门，概不吸收”的办法。如碧湖镇第五选区在一日晚上召开报名大会，干部见到报名人数已达到原规划指标，就赶紧上台宣布说：“够了！够了！”“不准再报了”，报名就此结束，这就引起了真正要求入社而未能报名入社的群众不满。南明区新兴乡有三户贫农和四户新下中农曾几次要求入社，也是以“入社户数已足”的理由把他们关在社门之外。对一些继续要求入社的富裕中农则只是说一声“你明年再来”。
    为什么会产生上述两种现象呢？这是因为一些干部把一些必要的控制也认为是“清规戒律”，因而就来者不拒。另一些干部仍是不敢大胆领导运动。同时，他们把规划指标看作是一成不变的东西，因而死啃规划数字。或者认为规规矩矩按上级规划指标办事，免得将来有个“三长二短”自己要负责任。这是没有把上级指示同当地实际情况结合起来所造成的结果。这两种现象目前虽然还只是在个别地方发生，但是值得引起注意。
    那末，怎样才能做到正确地领导运动前进呢？我认为，我们每一个农村工作干部都应该像优秀的汽车驾驶员掌握汽车那样来掌握运动。作为一个汽车驾驶员，必须头脑清醒、沉着，双手正确地掌握着驾驶盘，把汽车开得既快又稳，停或开的主动权始终操在汽车驾驶员手里。我们每一个干部领导农业合作化运动也应该如此，正确地大胆地指导运动前进，使运动的主动权始终掌握在自己的手里。要想做到这样，必须掌握以下几点：
    每一个干部要保持清醒的头脑，切不要被运动高潮把自己的头脑弄得“膨胀”起来。凤山区联城乡的负责同志看到入社的人很多，大大突破了规划指标后，就不去分析哪些人是真心要求入社，哪些人是口头要求入社而心里并不想入社或者不大想入社，而是把所有要求入社的人都同样对待。这显然是缺乏阶级分析观点的做法。在这种情况下，只要把脑子冷静下来想一想，对照对照毛泽东同志的指示，就会弄清底细的。同时，还要看看乡支部原定规划指标是否正确。如果是原来规划指标保守，那末，即使是突破了规划指标也不可怕，可以请示上级修订规划指标。如果原定规划指标没问题，却突破了指标，那一定是工作中有毛病，就应该适时地停止发展，进行检查。
    在“刹车”（停止发展）的具体工作中，丽水县个别地区也发生了问题，一种是“硬刹车”；另一种是“刹倒车”。所谓“硬刹车”就是上面所讲的慌慌忙忙关上合作社大门，闩上铁门闩。所谓“刹倒车”就是个别干部错误地采取了算合作社对中农“不利”账和中农入社“减产”账来动员中农不要入社。如碧湖区九龙乡工作干部对积极分子说：“你向他们（指中农）讲明入社是要‘减产’的，只要算算账，他们自然就不会来了。”这种作法的结果就会给农业合作化运动带来损失，并会助长富裕中农自发资本主义思想的发展。
    那末正确的“刹车”办法应该是怎么样呢？
    在“刹车”之前要做调查工作，先调查社外贫苦农民中应该入社而没有入社的人还有几户，是什么原因没有入社。对应该在今年入社的人，要向他们说明如果愿意在今年入社还是可以入社。如凤街乡凤山前村在扩建社结束之后，通过检查发现在规划中把四户贫农遗漏了，既没有列入今年规划，也没有列入明年规划之内，后来才确定今年吸收二户，明年吸收二户。还要再查一查已经入社的农民中是否有个别户是勉强跟进来的；或者是在个别干部的强迫命令下进来的。对这些人可以继续说明党的自愿原则，这样就会使合作社的质量更有保证。
    对待富裕中农也决不允许用“硬刹车”的办法。一般说，富裕中农对待自己的入社问题是顾虑重重，思想斗争十分激烈的。我在同五个要求入社而未获批准的富裕中农座谈中，发现他们有一种矛盾的心理：一方面，他们怕入社后会“减少收入”或“不自由”，个别的甚至怕“财产要匀分”。如六十多岁的老上中农张祥信说：“工作同志说贫农中农是亲兄弟，我夜里翻来复去睡不着，我想入社总会把我的土地、耕牛、农具分点给贫农，不然怎样叫亲兄弟呢？”另一方面，他们又怕站在社外将来雇不到工，怕统购要“吃亏”，怕买不到商品肥料，个别的怕把他当“坏分子”看待。正如富裕中农叶加银说：“我对入社问题总是东想西想，直算横算，算这算那，心神不定。”多数人是因为看到别人都入了社，感到自己站在社外孤立，就硬着头皮报名入社。后来我给他们说明了自愿原则和分批组织的道理后，他们表示愿意站在社外再看一年，明年再来。个别的还表示要再看两年，后年再来。张祥信说：“这样我心也放下来了，觉也睡安了，干活也有意思了”。因此我们在“刹车”的同时，必须向社外农民特别是富裕中农说明道理，安定他们的情绪，鼓励他们积极生产，办好互助组，争取明年再入社。这一步工作是十分必要的。
    在“刹车”之后，一面抽调骨干到县里学习，一面要迅速地将社员要求办社的热情体现到生产上来，制定和安排小段生产计划，在生产上很快地做出成绩来。这样才能进一步安定新社员情绪，使他们亲身体会到集体生产的巨大力量，从而安下心来办社。
