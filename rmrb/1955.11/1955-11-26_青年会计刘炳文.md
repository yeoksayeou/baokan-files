　　Young Accountant Liu Bingwen

　　Youth League member Liu Bingwen had only sporadically attended private school for a little over three years. He couldn't do written calculations or use an abacus. But because he was honest, reliable, and meticulous in his work, when the Shuguang Agricultural Production Cooperative was established in Luoji Township, Zhongxiang County, in the spring of 1954, everyone chose him to be the cooperative's accountant.
　　Having someone who can't do calculations as an accountant presents many difficulties. Liu Bingwen started keeping accounts using individual slips of paper. He would record whatever people reported; because he didn't understand multiplication and division, when the cooperative distributed things, he could only slowly calculate by counting on his fingers. If the numbers were too large, he would grab a handful of beans and divide them into several piles, counting them one by one, and if he counted wrong, he would have to start all over again. His work efficiency was very low, and he often had to stay up until midnight to rest.
　　The first time the members' labor work points were announced, Liu Bingwen mistakenly recorded member Li Jinyu's fifteen work points as thirteen, causing Li Jinyu to complain everywhere. Liu Bingwen felt even worse than Li Jinyu: he blamed himself for not being careful when recording, which brought losses to the work. He went to the cooperative chairman with a heavy heart, saying that his "cultural level was too low to do the accounting work." The chairman shook his head, smiled sympathetically, and said:
　　"Who among us has a high cultural level? Can we wait another ten years until you finish primary and secondary school before running the cooperative! Is it okay to be afraid of difficulties when building socialism? If you don't understand, ask; if you can't do it, learn!"
　　The next morning, Liu Bingwen went to a nearby village to seek advice from an old man named Lu who knew how to use an abacus. He agreed with Old Man Lu to learn abacus for two hours every night, guaranteeing he would never miss a class, rain or shine. He also borrowed a "Nine-Nine Multiplication Table" from Old Man Lu and set a goal for himself: to memorize at least one section every day. After more than a month of diligent study and practice, Liu Bingwen learned all the addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division methods of the abacus. He no longer counted on his fingers or used beans to calculate accounts.
　　However, Liu Bingwen was not satisfied with his existing achievements. He discovered that there were still many shortcomings in the current accounting work. For example, using the running account method to record work points without distinguishing between different types of work still made it easy to make mistakes. Moreover, the labor work points of a family were all recorded under the name of the head of the household, making it impossible to distinguish between the levels of labor of each individual. Some members were very dissatisfied, and contracting work and output became very chaotic. Liu Bingwen actively worked with the members to study ways to solve these problems: first, he drafted a "Work Record Table," dividing it into four columns: "Name, Time, Type of Work, Work Points"; and changed the method of establishing accounts by household to a method of establishing accounts based on labor force. The work point accounts were announced in the group every ten days and in the whole cooperative once a month. This kind of work recording and regular announcement of accounts made it not only difficult to make mistakes but also encouraged the members' enthusiasm for labor. In order to eliminate the chaotic phenomena in contracting work and output, Liu Bingwen discussed with the cooperative committee and production team leaders and drafted a "Contract Work Table" (the table divided the crop names, the number of fields, and the number of work needed) and stipulated the number of work points for cultivating land of different qualities, etc. As a result, the production team leaders and work recorders felt that the work was much easier to do.
　　Later, Liu Bingwen found that the financial work in the cooperative was still relatively chaotic; the cooperative's public property was being lost everywhere, and no one was managing it. Many members expressed dissatisfaction upon seeing this situation. Liu Bingwen felt that this would affect the consolidation of the cooperative if it continued. He shared his opinions with the cooperative committee members and together they formulated a set of financial management systems; specific regulations were made for the cooperative's expenditures, members' advances, grain distribution, and financial safekeeping. Liu Bingwen also required himself to regularly help the work recorders of each production team to diligently record accounts, diligently reconcile accounts, and regularly announce various accounts to the members. From then on, the financial work of the Shuguang Cooperative began to get on track.
　　Last autumn, eight cooperatives were established in Luoji Township, and this spring it developed to fifteen. Among the accountants in these cooperatives, Liu Bingwen was considered the most experienced. When the accountants of the newly established cooperatives encountered problems in their work, they all came to Liu Bingwen for advice. In addition to patiently helping everyone, Liu Bingwen often considered how to make everyone more familiar with accounting work. He thought: the township exchanges experience in production and mutual assistance and cooperation, and there is a mutual assistance and cooperation network. Wouldn't it be good if the accountants of the cooperatives were also organized into an accounting mutual assistance network to exchange accounting work experience? He proposed this idea to the Party branch, and it immediately received the active support of the Party branch and the county committee working group. In March of this year, the fifteen cooperatives in Luoji Township and the three cooperatives in the nearby Xinji and Shagang townships jointly established an accounting mutual assistance network. Everyone elected Liu Bingwen as the leader. Liu Bingwen and everyone researched the working methods of the accounting mutual assistance network: stipulating that meetings should be held once every half month or month to study accounting materials; proposing the problems encountered by each person in the accounting work and studying solutions together; and focusing on helping one cooperative to rectify accounts on time. With the mutual assistance of the accounting mutual assistance network, the accounting work of the newly established cooperatives was quickly improved.
　　Because Liu Bingwen loved the accounting work of the agricultural cooperative, worked hard to learn the business, and played an active and creative role in his work, he was selected as an activist in youth socialist construction and attended the National Youth Socialist Construction Activists Congress.

　　青年会计刘炳文

    青年团员刘炳文，从小只断断续续读过三年多私塾，不会笔算，也不会珠算。但因他诚实可靠，作事细心，一九五四年春天，钟祥县罗集乡曙光农业生产合作社成立的时候，大家就选他做社的会计。
    不会算账的人当会计，是有很多困难的。刘炳文开始记账是用一张一张的纸条，人家报多少他就记多少；因为不懂得乘法和除法，遇到社里分东西时，他只有扳着手指慢慢地算，数目多了，他就抓一把豆子来分作几堆一颗颗地数，数错了就得重来一次。工作效率很低，经常要熬到半夜才能休息。
    第一次公布社员劳动工分的时候，刘炳文把社员李金玉的十五个工，错记为十三个工，惹得李金玉到处吵嚷。刘炳文的心情比李金玉更难过：他责备自己记账不谨慎，给工作带来了损失。他怀着沉重的心情去找社长。说自己“文化水平太低，干不了这会计工作。”社长摇摇头，同情地笑笑说：
  “我们谁的文化水平高呢？我们能再等十年，等你读完了小学、中学再来办社吗！建设社会主义，怕困难还行？不懂就问，不会就学啊！”
    第二天大早，刘炳文就到附近湾里去找一位会打算盘的鲁老头请教。他同鲁老头约好：每天晚上去学两点钟的珠算，无论天晴、下雨，保证决不缺课。他还向鲁老头借了一份“九九歌诀”表，并且给自己规定：每天至少要背熟一段。经过一个多月的勤学苦练，刘炳文学会了珠算的全部加法、减法、乘法和除法。他不再扳指头、数豆子算账了。
    但是，刘炳文并不满足于已有的成绩，他发现目前的会计工作还是有很多缺点。比如说：用记流水账的办法记工分，没有分出个工种，还是容易错；而且，一家人的劳动工分都记在家长一个人的名下，各人的劳动也分不出个高低来。有些社员就很不满意，包工包产也搞得很混乱。刘炳文积极同社员们研究解决这些问题的办法：首先拟出了个“记工表”，分出“姓名、时间、工种、工分”四栏；又把分户立账的办法，改为以劳动力为单位的立账方法；工分账十天在小组公布一次，一月在全社公布一次。这样的记工和定期公布账目，既不容易发生错账，又能鼓励社员的劳动热情。为了消除包工包产中的混乱现象，刘炳文同社委、生产组长们商量拟定了一个“包工表”（表里分出庄稼名称、田亩数、需要工数）和规定耕种不同质量的土地的工数等。这样做的结果，生产组长和记工员都觉得工作好做得多。
    以后，刘炳文发现社里的财务工作还比较混乱；社里的公共东西到处丢失，也没有人经管。许多社员看见这种情况表示不满。刘炳文感到这样下去会影响社的巩固。他就自己的意见同社委们一起制定了一套管理财务的制度；对社里的开支、社员的预支、粮食分配、财务保管等作了具体规定。刘炳文还给自己规定经常要帮助各生产组的记工员做到：勤记账、勤对账，定期把各种账目向社员们公布。从这以后，曙光社的财务工作开始走上轨道。
    去年秋天，罗集乡建立了八个合作社，今年春天又发展到十五个。在这些合作社的会计里，刘炳文算是最有经验的了。新建社的会计遇到工作有问题，都跑来向刘炳文请教，刘炳文除了耐心帮助大家之外，经常考虑怎样才能使大家更好地熟悉会计工作。他想：乡里交流生产和互助合作方面的经验，有个互助合作网，要是把合作社的会计也组织成个会计互助网，交流会计工作的经验，不是很好吗？他把这个意见向党支部提出了，马上就得到了党支部和县委工作组的积极支持。今年三月间，罗集乡的十五个合作社同附近新集、沙港两个乡的三个合作社共同成立了一个会计互助网。大家选举刘炳文作组长。刘炳文和大家研究出会计互助网的工作方法：规定半月或者一个月开会一次，学习会计教材；提出各人在会计工作中遇到的问题，互相研究解决；按时重点帮助一个社整顿账目。在会计互助网的互相帮助下，新建社的会计工作得到很快的提高。
    由于刘炳文热爱农业合作社的会计工作，艰苦学习业务，并且在工作中发挥了积极性和创造性，他被选为青年社会主义建设积极分子，出席了全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会。
