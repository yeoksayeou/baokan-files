Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 4th, TASS dispatch: Joint statement by N.A. Bulganin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, and U Nu, Prime Minister of the Union of Burma

At the invitation of the government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, U Nu Prime Minister of the Union Of Burma paid a friendly visit to the Soviet Union. During his visit to the Soviet Union, Prime Minister U Nu held several talks with N.A. Bulganin, K.Y. Voroshilov, L.M. Kaganovich, A.I. Mikoyan, V.M. Molotov, M.Z. Saburov, and N.S. Khrushchev. During these friendly and sincere talks, the two sides extensively exchanged views on issues of common concern to both countries and also discussed certain international issues.

The Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR and the Prime Minister of the Union of Burma affirmed that, thanks to the remarkable and effective activities of peace-loving people in all countries of the world, there has been some relaxation of the international situation recently, and the desire to resolve pressing international issues through negotiations and consultations has strengthened. Contributing to this relaxation of the situation, first and foremost, are the armistice in Korea and the cessation of hostilities in Indochina; the signing of the Austrian State Treaty; the normalization of Soviet-Yugoslav relations, which cleared the way for the development of friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia; and the visit of Indian Prime Minister Nehru to the Soviet Union, which further consolidated the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and India.

The Asian-African Conference held in Bandung in April this year was of great significance for the relaxation of international tension. This was the first conference of its kind, at which representatives of countries with different political and social systems gathered together to achieve a common goal – to develop more comprehensive economic, cultural, and political cooperation. The conference reflected the tireless dedication of the people of Asia and Africa to striving for peace and national independence, and to achieving progress in all aspects of economic, cultural, and social life.

All of this created a favorable situation for the successful conduct of the Geneva Conference of the Heads of Government of the Four Powers, which played an important role in the cause of further easing international tension. The Geneva Conference of the Heads of Government of the Four Powers showed that international cooperation for peace is entirely possible at present. Building international trust is a realistic and attainable goal.

The Chairman of the Council of Ministers and the Prime Minister expressed the hope that the Foreign Ministers' Conference currently being held in Geneva will make every necessary effort to reach mutually agreeable decisions on all issues stipulated by the instructions of the Heads of Government of the Four Powers.

The issue of disarmament is one of the most important international issues of the present time. The scale of the expansion of armaments, especially the accumulation of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other types of weapons of mass destruction, is growing year by year, causing people of all countries to worry about the fate of the world and their own future. The growth of conventional and atomic armaments wastes national resources on non-productive aspects, and if the expansion of armaments were stopped, these resources could be used to improve the welfare of the peoples.

The Chairman of the Council of Ministers and the Prime Minister believe that the production testing, and the use of nuclear and thermonuclear weapons should be unconditionally prohibited. There must also be universal and massive reductions in conventional armaments. At the same time, effective international supervision should be established to monitor the implementation of this prohibition and disarmament. In this regard, proposals on universal arms reduction, the prohibition of atomic weapons, and the elimination of the threat of new wars are considered a realistic basis for reaching agreement on this issue.

The Chairman of the Council of Ministers and the Prime Minister unanimously condemned the policy of piecing together blocs and believe that the policy of non-alignment can guarantee the security of the peoples of all countries and play a significant role in establishing world peace.

The Chairman of the Council of Ministers and the Prime Minister believe that special attention should be paid to the issues of Asia and the Far East at present. The issue of returning Taiwan and other islands, which have been Chinese territory since ancient times, to the Chinese people should be resolved. Granting the People's Republic of China its rightful seat in the United Nations would strengthen the prestige and importance of the United Nations, enhance its role in international life, and promote the easing of tensions that still exist in the Far East.

The issues related to a political settlement in Indochina require immediate resolution in accordance with the decisions of the 1954 Geneva Conference. All these issues, as well as other Asian and Far Eastern issues, can and should be resolved peacefully through negotiations.

The Chairman of the Council of Ministers and the Prime Minister noted with satisfaction that the relations between the Soviet Union and Burma have always been sincere and friendly, which is fully in line with the interests of the peoples of the Soviet Union and Burma and helps to consolidate universal peace. This relationship is now and will continue to be based on the following unshakable principles: mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, peaceful coexistence, and economic cooperation.

These Principles, which have been recognized by many countries and peoples are aimed at consolidating peace and developing international cooperation.

The Chairman of the Council of Ministers and the Prime Minister believe it is extremely important that relations between all countries, large and small, be based on these principles.

The Chairman of the Council of Ministers and the Prime Minister believe that the principles of peaceful co-existence announced in this statement offer vast possibilities for the development of economic and cultural co-operation between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the Union of Burma.

    布尔加宁和吴努发表联合声明
    新华社四日讯　塔斯社莫斯科四日讯：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁和缅甸联邦总理吴努的联合声明
    缅甸联邦总理吴努应苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟政府的邀请，到苏联作了亲善访问。在苏联访问期间，吴努总理曾经同尼·亚·布尔加宁、克·叶·伏罗希洛夫、拉·莫·卡冈诺维奇、阿·伊·米高扬、维·米·莫洛托夫、马·扎·萨布罗夫、尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫进行了多次会谈。在这些友好和诚挚的会谈中，双方就两国共同有关的问题广泛地交换了意见，并且也讨论了某些国际问题。
    苏联部长会议主席和缅甸联邦总理确认，由于世界各国爱好和平的人民进行了卓著成效的活动，最近国际局势有了某些缓和，要求通过谈判和协商的办法解决迫切的国际问题的愿望加强了。促进这种局势缓和的，首先是朝鲜的停战和印度支那的停止敌对行动；奥地利国家条约的签订；为苏联和南斯拉夫的友谊和合作的发展扫清道路的苏南关系的正常化；印度总理尼赫鲁的访问苏联——由于尼赫鲁的访问，苏印两国的友好关系已经更加巩固了。
    今年四月在万隆举行的亚非会议对国际紧张局势的缓和有着重大的意义。这是第一次这样的会议：在这样的会议上，政治制度和社会制度不同的国家的代表聚会在一起以求达到共同的目的——发展更加全面的经济、文化和政治合作。会议反映了，亚非国家的人民在不倦地致力于争取和平和民族独立，争取在经济、文化和社会生活各方面取得进步。
    所有这一切为四国政府首脑日内瓦会议的圆满进行创造了有利的局势，这个会议在进一步缓和国际紧张局势的事业上起了重要的作用。四国政府首脑日内瓦会议表明：目前为了和平而实行国际合作是完全可能的。建立国际信任是一个现实的、可以达到的目的。
    部长会议主席和总理表示希望：目前在日内瓦举行的外交部长会议将竭尽一切必要的努力，以便就四国政府首脑的指示所规定的所有问题作出大家同意的决定。
    裁军问题是当前最重要的国际问题之一。扩张军备、特别是积累原子武器、氢武器和其他类型的大规模毁灭性武器的规模一年比一年扩大，使得各国人民对于世界的命运和自己的未来产生了忧虑。常规军备和原子军备的增长使国家资源浪费在非生产方面，要是停止扩充军备，这些资源就可以用来增进人民的福利。
    部长会议主席和总理认为，应当无条件地禁止生产、试验和使用核子和热核子武器。还必须实行普遍的大量裁减常规军备。同时应当建立有效的国际监督来监督这种禁令和裁军的实施。在这方面，关于普遍裁减军备、禁止原子武器和消除新战争威胁的建议，被认为是就这个问题达成协议的现实基础。
    部长会议主席和总理一致谴责拼凑集团的政策，并且认为，不加入集团的政策可以保证各国人民的安全，并且对建立世界和平有重大的作用。
    部长会议主席和总理认为，目前对亚洲和远东问题应当给予特别注意。关于把自古以来就是中国领土的台湾和其他一些岛屿归还给中国人民的问题应当得到解决。给予中华人民共和国以它在联合国中有权应得的席位，就会加强联合国的威信和重要性，就会加强它在国际生活中的作用，并且促进远东仍然存在的紧张局势的和缓。
    印度支那政治解决方面的问题，要求刻不容缓地按照一九五四年日内瓦会议的决定加以解决。这一切问题以及其他亚洲和远东问题都能够并且应当通过谈判用和平的办法求得解决。
    部长会议主席和总理很满意地指出，苏联和缅甸之间的关系一直是真诚和友好的，这完全符合于苏联和缅甸两国人民的利益并且有助于巩固普遍的和平。这种关系现在和将来都基于下列不可动摇的原则：互相尊重领土完整和主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处和经济合作。
    这些获得很多国家和人民承认的原则是以在于巩固和平和发展国际合作为目的的。
    部长会议主席和总理认为各大小国家之间的关系以这些原则为基础是极其重要的。
      部长会议主席和总理认为，在这个声明中所宣布的和平共处原则，为苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟和缅甸联邦之间的经济和文化合作的发展提供了巨大的可能性。
    部长会议主席和总理表示相信，苏联和缅甸在不久以前缔结贸易协定，将大大促进苏联和缅甸联邦之间的经济关系的进一步的发展，以及两国之间的文化和科学技术合作的扩大。
      部长会议主席和总理表示决心竭尽一切努力以进一步巩固苏联和缅甸之间的友谊，以发展两国之间最密切的联系。
    部长会议主席和总理对他们之间建立起个人接触一事表示满意，并且认为，双方就两国共同有关的问题交换意见，将有利于巩固全世界的和平和安全。
