Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 8th: The U.S. Army's Fifth Field Artillery Unit test-fired atomic rockets on the seventh in the scenic foothills of Mount Fuji in Japan.

    According to a Reuters report, the U.S. military also explained in detail to Japanese officers who visited how to use these atomic weapons during the test-firing.

    This step by the United States to turn Japan into an atomic military base has caused serious unease and strong opposition among the Japanese people. Two days before the U.S. military test-fired the atomic rockets, Shizuoka Prefecture, located on the southern slope of Mount Fuji, held a prefectural assembly on the fifth to oppose the atomic rocket exercise, and passed a resolution expressing protest. After the meeting, the 1,000 participants held a demonstration march against atomic weapons.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 6th: On the fifth, the Japanese government used force to forcibly measure the land of residents in Sunagawa Town, Tokyo, to implement the plan to expand the Tachikawa U.S. Air Force Base.

    On the morning of that day, the Japanese government's surveying team, protected by 200 policemen, arrived in Sunagawa Town. A picket line composed of local residents, trade union members, and members of the Socialist Party's Diet, linked arms to prevent the police force from entering the planned surveying site. At this time, the Japanese police authorities dispatched approximately 1,000 additional policemen, beat the residents, workers, and Diet members who were blocking them, forcibly broke through the blockade line, and enabled the surveying team to forcibly conduct the measurement. In order to defend their land, in the afternoon of the same day, local residents, including women and elderly women, along with trade union members and Socialist Party members, rushed towards the surveying team protected by the police to prevent them from surveying. The police force once again used force.

    According to Kyodo News, 45 residents were injured by the police in this conflict, and Socialist Party Diet member Yoshihara Hosokawa was also subjected to violence. In addition, three people, including Socialist Party member Hirabayashi Kajiro, were arrested. Some crops belonging to the residents were also trampled.

    This atrocity by the Japanese government has aroused even greater anger among local residents and workers. In the afternoon of the fifth, local residents and trade union members held a rally of rising up, preparing to persist in the struggle. (Attached photo)

    日本人民反对美国把日本变成原子军事基地
    新华社八日讯　东京消息：美国陆军第五野战炮兵队七日在日本名胜地富士山麓试放了原子火箭炮。
    据路透社报道，在试放这种原子武器时，美军还曾对前往参观的日本军官们详细说明了这种武器的使用方法。
    美国这种把日本变成原子军事基地的步骤，引起了日本人民严重的不安和强烈的反对。在美军试放原子火箭炮的前两天，富士山南麓的静冈县在五日举行了反对演习原子火箭炮的县民大会，通过了表示抗议的决议。会后，参加大会的一千人举行了反对原子武器的示威游行。
    新华社六日讯　东京消息：日本政府在五日施用武力，强制测量了东京砂川町居民的土地，来执行扩大立川美国空军基地的计划。
    这一天上午，日本政府的测量队在二百名警察的保护下，来到了砂川町。由当地居民、工会会员以及社会党的国会议员们组成的纠察队，手臂挽着手臂阻止警察部队进入预定测量的地点。这时，日本警察当局增派了约一千名警察，殴打阻止他们的居民、工人和国会议员们，用武力冲破了封锁线，使测量队强制进行测量。为了保卫自己的土地，当天下午，当地居民包括妇女和老太太们，又同工会会员、社会党议员们一道，冲向被警察保护着的测量队以阻止他们测量，警察部队再次使用了武力。
    据共同社报道，在这次冲突中，有四十五个居民被警察打伤，社会党国会议员吉田法晴也受到暴力的伤害。此外，社会党党员平林嘉次郎等三人被逮捕。居民的一些庄稼也被踏坏。
    日本政府的这种暴行，激起了当地居民和工人们更大的愤怒。五日下午，当地居民和工会会员们举行了奋起大会，准备坚持斗争。（附图片）
