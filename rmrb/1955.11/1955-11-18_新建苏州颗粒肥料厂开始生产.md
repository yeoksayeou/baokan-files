　　Newly Built Suzhou Granular Fertilizer Plant Begins Production
　　The newly built Suzhou Granular Fertilizer Manufacturing Plant in Jiangsu Province has already produced more than 3 million jin of granular fertilizer this year. This fertilizer can supply the needs of more than 50,000 mu of land. In the third quarter, 330,000 jin of granular fertilizer have been allocated to state-owned farms and agricultural producers' cooperatives in 22 counties and cities including Songjiang, Nanhui, Nantong, Huaiyin, Tongshan, Jiangdu, and Jiangning.
　　Manufacturing granular fertilizer is learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. It is suitable for various crops and soils, has low cost, concentrated fertilizer content, and long-lasting fertilizer effect. Compared with bean cake fertilizer with the same fertilizer effect, the price can be 30% cheaper, and the yield is higher than bean cake. For example, the wheat in the state-owned Lianhu Farm this year, using granular fertilizer, increased production by 12% compared to using bean cake fertilizer. The entire farm used granular fertilizer on 1,000 mu of autumn-plowed wheat fields this year, a nineteen-fold increase compared to last year.
　　The workers of the granular fertilizer plant, in order to support the peasants in increasing grain production, actively improved the efficiency of turning and drying under the conditions of ensuring quality and without increasing manpower and equipment, so that the daily output of granular fertilizer increased by 25%.

　　新建苏州颗粒肥料厂开始生产
    江苏省今年新建的苏州颗粒肥料制造厂已经生产了三百多万斤颗粒肥料。这些肥料可以供给五万多亩土地的需用。在第三季度内，已经有三十三万斤颗粒肥料调给了松江、南汇、南通、淮阴、铜山、江都、江宁等二十二个县、市的国营农场和农业生产合作社。
    制造颗粒肥料是学习苏联的先进经验。它适用于各种作物和土壤，成本低，肥份集中，肥效也长。把同等肥效的豆饼比较，价格可便宜百分之三十，产量比豆饼高。如国营练湖农场的小麦，今年用颗粒肥料的比用豆饼肥料的增产百分之十二。全场今年秋耕麦田用颗粒肥料的有一千亩，比去年增加十九倍。
    颗粒肥料厂的工人们，为了支援农民增产粮食，在保证质量，不增加人力和设备的条件下，积极提高翻晒效率，使颗粒肥料的日产量提高了百分之二十五。（本报驻南京记者）
