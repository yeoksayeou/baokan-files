The CCP Leiyang County Committee and the Fifth District Committee
Why Did They Trust and Support the Reactionary Rich Peasant Xie Chaoyun So Much?

To the Editor:
    In Shuangshi Township, Leiyang County, Hunan Province, a rich peasant element, Xie Chaoyun, who had consistently exploited and oppressed peasants, became an administrative group leader and peasant representative after liberation. He was successively rated as an A-level labor model in the county and province, served as the director of an agricultural producers' cooperative, stole the title of Communist Party member (probationary), and finally became a "model" for the entire county. Under the cover of these "honors," he wantonly carried out sabotage activities. In recent years, although the local masses have continuously exposed Xie Chaoyun's evil deeds, many leading personnel in the county and district have ignored the opinions of the masses and placed great trust in this rich peasant element.
    Xie Chaoyun was a former soldier and always bullied peasants and played with women. After 1944, he relied on the power of local despotic landlords such as Chen Shuidong, Chen Yuguang, and Chen Yudu to act recklessly. His family of fourteen had more than thirteen mu of self-cultivated land, rented more than one hundred dan of land (about twenty mu), hired more than one hundred and thirty part-time workers each year, collected about ten dan of grain in cow rentals, and engaged in severe usury. His exploitative income exceeded 30% of his total income. Shouldn’t he be classified as a rich peasant, isn’t that very obvious? During the land reform, the local peasant masses unanimously proposed that his family should be classified as rich peasants. However, at that time, he staged a fake "family division;" the staff leading the land reform movement in this township actually believed him and completely ignored the correct opinions of the masses, classifying Xie Chaoyun and his brother as middle peasants, and only classifying his eighty-year-old father, who had long been out of the picture, as a rich peasant. In this way, his family escaped the "land reform checkpoint."
    Then, Xie Chaoyun pretended to be active and became the administrative group leader of the village. In 1950, the Central South Region held a materials exchange conference, and he was designated by the landlords and bullies who had usurped township power at the time as a "peasant representative" to attend this conference. In 1951, he was designated by the landlord Chen Shoujie, who had stolen the position of township secretary, to attend the county labor model conference and was rated as a "second-class labor model" in the county. After returning, he organized a "mutual aid group" and used methods such as not evaluating work points and lowering wages to carry out exploitation in the group. In the autumn of 1952, he stole the sweet potatoes, loofahs, eggplants, and other products of Xie Chaolian from the same village to participate in the county's native and special product exhibition, and attended the provincial labor model conference, fraudulently obtaining the honors of "A-level labor model" in the province and county and many prizes. The local masses saw this situation very clearly. Li Si'ai, a labor model at the time, said with dissatisfaction: "How can someone who relies on the power of landlords to oppress and exploit peasants become a labor model?" Many peasants also went directly to the district committee to expose Xie Chaoyun's deceptive behavior. Who knew that such a serious problem did not attract the attention of those local leaders! Bai Niu Bao and Chen Dongcheng, the former and latter district party secretaries, instead said that the masses were "attacking labor models" and asked district cadres to "support labor models"! Moreover, from 1952, the county party committee regarded Shuangshi Township as a key production area and specially sent Deng Baohong, the head of the Civil Affairs Section, to cultivate Xie Chaoyun as a "model," allowing him to be a "legal labor model" every year.
    In the spring of 1954, in order to fraudulently obtain greater honors, Xie Chaoyun dismantled the mutual aid groups of Chen Chaozhi and Chen Shouhui in the village, drawing relatively wealthy peasants into his own "mutual aid group"; in the winter of the same year, he transformed the "mutual aid group" into the Yangjiashan "Agricultural Producers' Cooperative," becoming the director himself. He further displayed his two-faced methods, pretending to be very active in front of the county and district party committees, never missing any meetings; but secretly seizing various opportunities to carry out sabotage. For example, in last year's unified grain purchase work, under the guise of "early sale" and "fast delivery," he retained more grain and spread reactionary remarks such as "the government is exploiting the peasants' grain" to some peasant masses. However, the relevant leading personnel placed even more trust in this cunning rich peasant element! Chen Dongcheng, the district party secretary, worked in Shuangshi Township for nine months, and the opinions of the masses should have been very clear. Strangely, he used the reason that Xie Chaoyun was an "active element who could withstand the attacks of the masses" to admit Xie Chaoyun into the party (probationary member) in September last year.
    After Xie Chaoyun wormed his way into our ranks, he carried out sabotage activities even more unscrupulously. He helped his brother Xie Chaokui usurp the position of production committee member in the cooperative, jointly stirring up trouble in the cooperative, engaging in inciting discord, undermining unity, and creating disputes. When distributing early-maturing crops and evaluating work points, he deliberately disadvantaged poor peasants and dampened their production enthusiasm. He also allowed his father to use the cooperative's cattle and farm tools free of charge and assigned cooperative members to work in his father's fields. Therefore, the peasant masses reflected that "the Yangjiashan Agricultural Producers' Cooperative is serving the rich peasants." Many upright peasants struggled against Xie Chaoyun. For example, Xie Pinlai (a party member), the deputy director, dared to expose bad people and bad deeds, and even proposed the opinion that "middle peasants should not be directors." Xie Chaoyun harbored resentment and tried every means to attack him, and requested the district party committee to expel Xie Pinlai from the party and purge him from the cooperative. At this time, the leading personnel of the county and district, such as Zhang Donghai, the county party secretary of Leiyang County, Yang Zezhi, the county magistrate, and Chen Dongcheng, the secretary of the Fifth District Party Committee, had already discovered that Xie Chaoyun was a rich peasant element who had infiltrated; however, they still cherished Xie Chaoyun and believed that "his production was doing well," so they condoned and tolerated him, and delayed handling him.
    I believe that the CCP Leiyang County Committee and the Fifth District Committee should seriously review this mistake and quickly sanction this reactionary rich peasant element Xie Chaoyun.

### 中共耒阳县委和五区区委　为什么这样信任和支持反动富农谢朝运

　　中共耒阳县委和五区区委
　　为什么这样信任和支持反动富农谢朝运编辑同志：
    在湖南耒阳县双石乡，一个一贯剥削和压迫农民的富农分子谢朝运，在解放以后竟当上了行政组长和农民代表，连续被评为县里的和省里的甲等劳动模范，担任了农业生产合作社的社长，窃取了共产党员（候补党员）的称号，最后成了全县的一面“旗帜”。他就在这些“荣誉”的掩盖下，放肆地进行着破坏活动。几年来，当地群众虽则曾经不断揭发谢朝运的罪恶行为，但是县区的不少领导人员居然对群众的意见不理不睬，而对这个富农分子却万分信任。
    谢朝运过去是个兵痞，一贯欺压农民，玩弄妇女。一九四四年以后又借着本地恶霸地主陈水东、陈玉广、陈玉读等的势力，胡作非为。他家十四口人，有自耕田十三亩多，佃耕田一百多担（约二十亩左右），每年要雇一百三十多个零工，收牛租约十担谷子，还有严重的高利盘剥行为。如同村的谢朝连在一九四六年向他家借了五担谷，过了两年，家里八担田、一间房子和一口小鱼塘就都被他算去了。这样一个剥削收入超过总收入百分之三十以上的人，应该划成富农成分，难道不是很明显的吗？在土地改革中，当地农民群众也一致提出应该把他家划为富农成分。但是，当时他耍了一次假“分家”；领导这个乡的土地改革运动的工作人员竟相信了他，而完全不理睬群众的正确意见，把谢朝运和他哥哥划成中农成分，只把他早已不管事的八十多岁的父亲划为富农成分。就这样，他家逃过了“土改关”。
    接着，谢朝运又伪装积极，当上了村里的行政组长。一九五○年，中南区召开物资交流大会，他被当时篡夺了乡政权的地主、恶霸指定为出席这次会议的“农民代表”。一九五一年，他被窃取了乡秘书职位的地主陈寿杰指定出席县劳动模范大会，被评为县里的“乙等劳动模范”。回来以后，他组织了一个“互助组”，在组里采取不评工记分和压低工资等办法来进行剥削。一九五二年秋，他又将本村谢朝连的红薯、丝瓜、茄子等偷去参加县土产特产展览会，并且出席了省劳动模范大会，骗取了省里和县里“甲等劳动模范”的荣誉和不少奖品。当地群众对这种情况看得很清楚。当时的劳动模范黎四爱不满地说：“靠地主势力压迫剥削农民的人也能当劳动模范？”不少农民还直接到区委会去揭发谢朝运的欺骗行为。谁知道，这样严重的问题竟没有引起当地那些领导人员的重视！白牛保和陈东承这两个前后任的区委书记反而都说群众在“打击劳动模范”，要区干部“给劳动模范撑腰”！而且从一九五二年起，县委又把双石乡当成生产重点，专门派了民政科长邓保宏来培养谢朝运这面“旗帜”，让他每年当“法定劳动模范”。
    一九五四年春，谢朝运为了骗取更大的荣誉，竟将本村陈朝侄、陈寿会两个互助组拆散，把其中比较富裕的农民抽到自己的“互助组”来；同年冬季就把“互助组”转为杨家山“农业生产合作社”，自己当上了社长。他又进一步施展自己的两面手法，在县委、区委面前伪装得非常积极，一切会议从不缺席；而暗地里却抓住各种机会进行破坏。像在去年粮食统购工作中，他在“早卖”“快送”等幌子的掩盖下多留了粮食，还向部分农民群众散布“政府剥削农民的粮食”等反动言论。但是，对于这样一个狡诈的富农分子，有关领导人员却反而更加信任他了！区委书记陈东承在双石乡工作了九个月，群众的意见应该了解得很清楚，奇怪的是他竟以谢朝运是“经得起群众打击的积极分子”为理由，在去年九月把谢朝运吸收入党（候补党员）。
    谢朝运钻进了我们的肚皮里来以后，更加肆无忌惮地进行破坏活动。他帮助他哥哥谢朝奎窃取了社里的生产委员的职务，共同在社里兴风作浪，进行挑拨离间，破坏团结，制造纠纷。他在分配早熟作物和评工记分的时候，故意使贫农吃亏，打击贫农的生产积极性。他又将社里的耕牛、农具无偿地给他父亲用和指派社员替他父亲作田。因此，农民群众反映“杨家山农业生产合作社是给富农办事的”。不少正直的农民向谢朝运进行了斗争。如副社长谢品来（党员）勇于揭发坏人坏事，还提过“中农不能当社长”的意见，谢朝运就怀恨在心，百般打击他，并向区委要求把谢品来开除党籍和清洗出社。这时，县区的领导人员，像耒阳县的县委书记张东海、县长杨泽芝、五区区委书记陈东承等早已经发现谢朝运是个混进来的富农分子；但是他们对谢朝运还是爱护备至，认为“他的生产搞得不错”，因而对他姑息纵容，迟迟不作处理。
    我认为中共耒阳县委和五区区委对于这一错误，应该严肃地进行检讨，并迅速制裁这个反动富农分子谢朝运。             万志惠
