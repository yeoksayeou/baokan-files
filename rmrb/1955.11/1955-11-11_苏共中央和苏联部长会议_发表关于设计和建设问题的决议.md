Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 9th (TASS dispatch): The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the USSR have issued a resolution on eliminating waste in design and construction.

The resolution points out that the Soviet Union is undertaking enormous construction and reconstruction of towns and industrial enterprises. Agricultural construction, especially in reclaimed areas, is also being carried out on a large scale. Many economical and conveniently laid out good houses and public buildings have been built.

In recent years, the industrialized method of construction using prefabricated structures, components, and high-efficiency building materials has been developed, and advanced construction techniques are increasingly being promoted. Many design and construction organizations have adopted standard designs in construction, which can speed up construction and reduce costs.

Recently, the Communist Party and the Soviet government have taken a number of measures to fundamentally improve construction work. Many skilled workers, engineers, and architects have been trained, who correctly understand their task—to build economical houses and buildings that meet modern requirements, and to adopt industrialized structures and advanced working methods in construction.

The resolution states that if there were no major shortcomings and errors in design and construction work, the achievements in this area would be much greater. The CPSU Central Committee and the USSR Council of Ministers pointed out that in the work of many construction and design organizations, the emphasis on the appearance of buildings has become a trend, with many superfluous decorations, which is not in line with the Party and government's policy in construction work.

Many architects, because of their passion for appearance, put their main efforts on the decoration of the exterior of the houses, instead of striving to improve the interior design and equipment of the houses and apartments, neglecting the need to create various convenient facilities for residents, and neglecting the requirements of economy and normal use of the houses.

Unnecessary tower-shaped superstructures, many decorative large columns, cloisters, and other antique superfluous architectural decorations have become a common phenomenon in the construction of houses and public buildings. As a result, a large amount of state funds has been wasted in housing construction in recent years, and this fund could have been used to build houses with a construction area of no less than one million square meters for the working people.

The resolution then listed some examples to illustrate how much waste was caused by the errors in architecture, design, and construction in Moscow, Leningrad, Tbilisi, Kiev, Kharkov, Minsk, Voronezh, Baku, Rostov-on-Don, and other cities.

The CPSU Central Committee and the USSR Council of Ministers severely criticized these errors because they violated the Party and government's policy in this work, caused great losses to the national economy, and hindered the improvement of the housing and cultural living conditions of the working people.

The resolution emphasized that when designing and constructing houses and buildings, architects and engineers should focus their main attention on the economic issues of construction, on creating the most convenient facilities for residents, on the perfect equipment of houses, schools, hospitals, and other houses and buildings, and on the greening of residential areas and street areas.

In order to avoid superfluous decorations and handicraft methods, architects and engineers should become advocates of everything new and advanced in design and construction, and should carry out construction according to the most economical design standards, which should refer to the best achievements in construction at home and abroad, and be drafted according to industrialized construction methods.

The CPSU Central Committee and the USSR Council of Ministers pointed out that the purity of form, precision, and economic viability of the scheme should be the characteristics of Soviet architecture. In order to make the appearance of houses and buildings attractive, it should not be done by far-fetched, costly decorative methods, but by the organic combination of architectural form with the use of houses and buildings, by their good symmetry, by the rational use of materials, structures and components, and also by high engineering quality.

The resolution instructs the State Construction Committee of the USSR Council of Ministers, the USSR Academy of Architecture, the USSR Union of Architects, ministers and heads of competent departments, executive committees of the Soviets, architects, and engineering and technical personnel of construction sites and design organizations to fundamentally reform design and construction work in the shortest possible time, to widely adopt standard designs in construction, to bravely learn from the advanced achievements in construction work at home and abroad, and to constantly conduct uncompromising struggles against manifestations of formalism in architecture and against waste in design and construction.

The resolution decided to revise the design budgets of construction projects within a period of three months, in order to resolutely overcome waste in architectural decoration, layout schemes, and structural schemes in the design.

The CPSU Central Committee and the USSR Council of Ministers pointed out that the main task of design organizations, architects, and engineers is to formulate economic standard designs and standard structures, and to adopt them in construction. In order to carry out the construction of civil residences according to high-quality standard designs that can ensure a significant reduction in costs and ensure the improvement of living conditions for residents, it was decided to formulate new standard designs for the following buildings before September 1, 1956: two-story, three-story, four- to five-story residential buildings, schools that can accommodate 280, 400 to 880 students, hospitals with 100, 200, 300 to 400 beds, children's welfare institutions, shops and public catering enterprises, cinemas, sanatoriums, hotels and rest homes; the excellent experience in design and construction at home and abroad should be utilized in the design.

In addition to completing the planned standard designs, in order to solicit the best design schemes, competitions will be organized to widely attract architects, engineers and other experts and all the staff of the design teams to participate in this work.

The resolution believes that it is necessary to organize a national central institution to formulate standard designs for housing and public buildings.

The resolution also decided to fundamentally improve the work of training architectural cadres.

The resolution announced the revocation of the title of Stalin Prize winner for three architects who caused great waste in the construction of the "Leningrad" Hotel and residential buildings in Moscow. The CPSU Central Committee and the Council of Ministers suggested that the relevant authorities remove five architects who caused waste in design and construction work from their positions.

In the final part of the resolution, the CPSU Central Committee and the USSR Council of Ministers expressed their firm belief that the Party, Soviet, and trade union organizations, workers and engineering technical personnel, architects and scientific workers will dedicate their strength, knowledge, and experience in order to eliminate the existing shortcomings in design and construction work in the shortest possible time, which will greatly help to improve the people's living standards and strengthen the Soviet economy.

    苏共中央和苏联部长会议
    发表关于设计和建设问题的决议
    新华社十日讯　塔斯社莫斯科九日讯：苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议发表了关于消除设计和建设中的浪费现象的决议。
    决议指出，苏联正在进行巨大的建设和改建城镇和工业企业的工作。农业建设，特别是在垦荒地区的农业建设也正在大规模地进行。建成了许多经济而平面布置舒适方便的好住宅和公用房屋。
    最近几年，使用装配式结构、构件和高效能的建筑材料来进行建设的工厂化方法得到了发展，先进的建筑施工工艺规程日益推广。许多设计和建设机构在建设中采用标准设计，这就可以加快建设速度并且降低造价。
    最近，共产党和苏联政府采取了一些根本改进建设工作的措施。培养了许多熟练的工人、工程师和建筑师干部，他们正确地理解自己的任务——要建设符合现代要求的经济的房屋和建筑物，在建设中采用工厂化结构和先进的工作方法。
    决议说，在设计和建设工作中如果没有巨大的缺点和错误，那末在这方面的成绩就会更大得多。苏共中央和苏联部长会议指出，在许多建筑和设计机构的工作中，注重建筑物的外表已经成为风气，有很多多余的装饰，这是不符合党和政府在建筑—建设工作中的方针的。
    许多建筑师因为热衷于外表，所以把主要力量放在房屋外表的装饰上面，而不去努力改进住宅和住房的内部设计和设备，不重视为居住者创造种种方便的设施的必要性，不重视节约和房屋的正常使用的要求。
    毫无必要的塔形上层建筑、许多装饰用的大柱子、回廊和其他仿古的多余的建筑装饰已经成为在建设住宅和公用房屋时的普遍现象。结果，最近几年在住宅建设方面浪费了大量的国家资金，用这笔资金可以为劳动人民建造建筑面积不下于一百万平方公尺的房屋。
    决议接着列举了一些例子，说明莫斯科、列宁格勒、第比利斯、基辅、哈尔科夫、明斯克、沃罗涅日、巴库、顿河上的罗斯托夫和其他城市在建筑、设计和建设方面所犯的错误造成了多么大的浪费。
    苏共中央和苏联部长会议严厉地斥责这些错误，因为这些错误违反了党和政府在这项工作中的方针，给国民经济带来了巨大的损失，并且阻碍了劳动人民的住宅和文化生活条件的改善。
    决议着重指出，在设计和建设房屋、建筑物的时候，建筑师和工程师应当把主要的注意力放在建筑的经济问题上面，放在为居住者创造最方便的设施上面，放在住宅、学校、医院和其他房屋和建筑物的完善的设备上面，放在住宅区和街道区的绿化问题上面。
    为了避免多余的装饰和手工业的方法，建筑师和工程师应当成为设计和建设中一切新的、先进的事物的倡导人，应当根据最经济的标准设计进行建设，而这些设计则应当参考国内外建设事业中的最好成就，并且根据工厂化的施工方法草拟出来。
    苏共中央和苏联部长会议指出，形式的纯朴、精确和方案的经济，应该成为苏联建筑的特点。为了使房屋和建筑物外观动人，不应该用牵强附会的、花费很多的装璜修饰的办法，而应该靠建筑形式同房屋和建筑物的用途的有机的结合，靠它们之间的很好的对称，靠合理地使用材料、结构和构件，还靠很高的工程质量。
    决议责成苏联部长会议国家建设委员会、苏联建筑科学院、苏联建筑师协会、各部部长和主管机关领导人、苏维埃执行委员会、建筑师、工地和设计机关的工程技术人员在最短期内根本改革设计和建设工作，在建设中普遍采用标准设计，勇敢地学习国内外建设工作上的先进成就，对建筑上的形式主义的表现以及对设计和建设中的浪费现象经常进行不调和的斗争。
    决议决定在三个月期内重新订正在建筑施工项目的设计预算书，以便坚决地克服设计中在建筑装饰、平面布置方案和结构方案方面的浪费现象。
    苏共中央和苏联部长会议指出，设计机关、建筑师和工程师的主要任务是拟定经济的标准设计和标准结构，并且在建设中加以采用。为了按照可以保证大大减低造价和保证改进居住者生活条件的、质量高的标准设计来实行民用住宅的建设，特决定在一九五六年九月一日以前制定出下列建筑物的新的标准设计：二层、三层、四层至五层楼的住宅，可以容纳二百八十、四百至八百八十名学生的学校，一百、二百、三百至四百张床位的医院，儿童福利机关，商店和公共饮食企业，电影院，疗养院，旅馆和休养所；在设计时要利用国内外设计和建设上的优良的经验。
    除了完成规定的标准设计的计划外，为了征求最好的设计方案，将组织竞赛来广泛吸收建筑师、工程师和其他专家以及设计团体的全体人员来参加这项工作。
    决议认为必须组织一个国家中央机构来制定住宅和公用房屋的标准设计。
    决议还决定根本改进培养建筑干部的工作。
    决议宣布撤销在建设“列宁格勒”旅馆和莫斯科的住宅中造成巨大浪费的三名建筑师的斯大林奖金得奖人的称号。苏共中央和部长会议建议有关机关解除在设计和建设工作中造成浪费的五名建筑师的职务。
    苏共中央和苏联部长会议在决议的最后部分表示坚信，党、苏维埃和工会组织，工人和工程技术人员，建筑师和科学工作人员，将献出自己的力量、知识和经验，以便在最短的期间内消灭设计和建设工作中的现有缺点，这将大大有助于提高人民的生活水平和加强苏联的经济。
