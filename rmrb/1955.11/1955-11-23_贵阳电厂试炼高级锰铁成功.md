　　Guiyang Power Plant Successfully Trials High-Grade Ferromanganese
　　The Guiyang Power Plant Metallurgical Institute has successfully trialed high-grade ferromanganese.
　　High-grade ferromanganese is one of the important raw materials for smelting high-manganese steel and can also be used to smelt ordinary steel. High-manganese steel is not only an important material for manufacturing mining machinery and high-precision machine parts, but also an indispensable steel for manufacturing railway tracks and building bridges.
　　Soon, the Guiyang Power Plant Metallurgical Institute will transport large quantities of products to Anshan, East China, Taiyuan, Tianjin, Kunming and other regions to support the steel industry.

　  贵阳电厂试炼高级锰铁成功
    贵阳电厂冶炼所试炼高级锰铁成功。
    高级锰铁是冶炼高锰钢的重要原料之一，也可以用来冶炼普通钢。高锰钢不仅是制造矿山机器和精密度较高的机器零件的重要材料，而且是制造铁路钢轨和修筑桥梁等不可缺少的钢材。
    不久，贵阳电厂冶炼所就会把大批产品运往鞍山、华东、太原、天津、昆明等地区支援炼钢工业。
