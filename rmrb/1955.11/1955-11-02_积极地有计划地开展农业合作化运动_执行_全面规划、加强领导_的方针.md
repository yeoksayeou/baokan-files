Actively and Systematically Carry Out the Agricultural Cooperation Movement
Implement the Policy of "Overall Planning, Strengthening Leadership"
Hua Jun

    Xin Sheng Township in Yancheng County, Jiangsu Province, has a total of five villages and 649 households. Among them, there are 288 poor peasant households, 158 new and old lower-middle peasant households, 148 new and old upper-middle peasant households, 49 rich peasant households, and 6 landlord households. This spring, the township established six agricultural production cooperatives, with 191 peasant households joining, accounting for 29.4% of the total households. The township has 15 permanent mutual aid teams and 8 temporary mutual aid teams, with 343 peasant households participating, accounting for 52.85% of the total households.

    This autumn, the six cooperatives generally had bumper harvests, with an average increase of 13% compared to before the establishment of the cooperatives, and nearly 10% more than the surrounding mutual aid teams. The superiority of cooperation attracted peasants outside the cooperatives. Fifteen permanent mutual aid teams in the township were actively preparing to establish cooperatives, and five temporary mutual aid teams and some individual farmers requested to join the cooperatives. A total of 288 households in the township had "registered" with the Party branch, requesting to establish new cooperatives or join old ones. A high tide of cooperation has already formed.

    Due to insufficient understanding of the new situation of the arrival of the high tide, the Party branch initially acted according to the original plan, limiting its work to the circle of eight typical mutual aid teams that were originally prepared to establish cooperatives. As a result, the leadership failed to keep up with the development of the movement and was once in a passive state. Therefore, in the spontaneous activities of the masses preparing to establish cooperatives, the following problems arose:

    1. Excluding poor peasants from joining the cooperatives. Some middle peasants, and even a few Party members and cadres, wanted to establish cooperatives with people who were "equally matched," believing that "with complete farm tools and sufficient cattle, the cooperative can be run well." They thought that absorbing poor peasants would result in "losses" and "more difficulties, and the cooperative would not be run well." For example, the Lu Zhengfa mutual aid team in Ludang Village (a total of 12 poor peasant households) had requested to join the cooperative last winter and this spring, but the branch did not agree. Now they are requesting to join the Ludang No. 1 Cooperative, and some members have submitted reports applying three or four times, but they have been rejected by Bian Xuelong (a Party member), the vice-chairman of the cooperative. While rejecting poor peasants from joining the cooperative, Bian Xuelong went to absorb three rich peasant households: Yuan Xuezhong, Ni Jigen, and Yuan Junfa. Team leader Lu Zhengfa angrily stated: "If they don't want us, we will organize a 'poor people's' cooperative." When establishing a cooperative in Zhangli Village, some middle peasants were unwilling to be with poor peasants and wanted to organize a "middle peasant cooperative" separately. A total of 36 poor peasant households in the township were excluded from joining the cooperatives.

    2. Competing for the backbone of cooperative establishment. After the full-scale development of the cooperation movement, the existing backbone seemed to be few and unevenly distributed because the branch did not pay attention to discovering and cultivating new activists. Some cadres with poor work styles in the past were unwilling to be elected by the masses as "heads of the household." Therefore, there was competition for good backbone. At that time, there were five mutual aid teams in the township that were preparing to establish cooperatives, but they could not be established because they lacked leadership backbone. The mutual aid team in the west of Chen She Village, Chen She Zhuang, was preparing to establish a cooperative. Because there was no accountant, the team leader ran to the mutual aid team in the east of the village at night to mobilize Li Huaiming and pull him out to be the accountant, which caused dissatisfaction among the members of the eastern team. The members of this team said: Whether you're a person or a ghost, you dragged away our team's good accountant at night. The Han Yuliang mutual aid team originally had 25 households actively requesting to establish a cooperative. The branch planned to recommend Party member Han Shigao (who had a very bad work style and was the dismissed village chief) as the chairman of the cooperative. The team members' enthusiasm quickly declined, and seven households jumped to other teams.

    3. Individual farmers are left unattended. Township staff only focused on leading eight typical mutual aid teams to establish cooperatives, and some poor peasants who were excluded from joining the cooperatives had no one to lead their production. Liu Jirong, a poor peasant in Wugang Village, was not active in production because he could not join the cooperative. The Wang Zhaojun mutual aid team in Chen She Village had 11 poor peasant households who allowed 31 mu of paddy fields to dry up. They said: We are not happy to produce without a cooperative. We will be more energetic when the cooperative is established. Some upper-middle peasants who are currently unwilling to join the cooperative are uneasy: they are afraid of raising their class status; they are afraid of increasing production during unified grain purchase; they are afraid that the government will treat them differently. No one has bothered to ask about these issues.

    4. Landlords and rich peasants take the opportunity to sabotage. Some landlords and rich peasants "beg" township staff to join the cooperatives, attempting to "sneak in" and sabotage. Some used methods such as bribery, instigation, and threats, attempting to "pull out" peasants who had already requested to join the cooperatives. Li Hongtai and Sun Shujin, rich peasants in Chen She Village, used the method of paying wages in advance to win over 11 households including Li Huairen and Li Huaicai, saying: It's better for one person to beat a dog than for ten people to kill a cow. Sun Hongcheng, a rich peasant in Zhangli Village, threatened Dai Xuelou, a Party member who did not allow him to join the cooperative, saying: "What feud do I have with you?" and said: "I'll have my day as long as you have yours."

    5. The Party branch also has divided opinions on agricultural cooperation. Most of the 48 Party members in the township actively support the establishment of cooperatives and are very enthusiastic. The branch secretary, Wei Chengxuan, believes that the masses' demands for establishing cooperatives should be actively supported. However, a few Party members believe that it should be done "slowly" and "steadily." For example, Party member Li Huaihe said: "It is not easy to lead if the pace is too fast." Thirty-four households in the mutual aid team he led requested to join the cooperative, but he only agreed to 24 households. Individual Party members with relatively wealthy lives hide behind the masses and are unwilling to join the cooperative. Party member Han Shihe, seeing that the surrounding masses were taking action, was afraid of not being able to "escape" at home and requested the branch to approve him to work on the river project. Party member Chen Jinshu said: "There are no conditions now, let's wait one or two years. I will definitely not participate this year."

    With the help of the higher-level Party committee, the branch earnestly studied Comrade Mao Zedong's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation," summarized the experience of establishing cooperatives in the township, saw the concrete facts of the superiority of agricultural cooperatives, and criticized the passive emotions and spontaneous capitalist tendencies of some Party members. Party members who had erroneous understandings of cooperation all examined their erroneous thinking. Xu Bulian, a member of the branch committee and director of the township credit cooperative, used to excuse himself by saying he was "busy with work" and had no time to run agricultural cooperatives. Now he confessed: "It's not that I'm busy, it's that my thinking is wrong. From today onwards, I will wholeheartedly participate in running agricultural cooperatives." Liu Zhengyuan, a demobilized soldier and Party member, initially wavered because his mother was unwilling to join the cooperative. Now he expressed his determination to persuade his mother and proposed to take out his 120 yuan demobilization fund as an investment in joining the cooperative. On the basis of a unified understanding of cooperation, education on class policy was carried out, and the erroneous thinking of excluding poor peasants was criticized. Party members who had excluded poor peasants or wanted to let rich peasants join the cooperatives all made self-criticisms. Party member LÃ¼ Jinbang said: "Originally, I only saw the rich peasants' cattle and farm tools, but I didn't see the class essence of the rich peasants; I only saw 'many difficulties' for the poor peasants, and I forgot that they are the force to rely on. Now I understand." Bian Xuelong, the Party member who originally attempted to absorb rich peasants and exclude poor peasants from joining the cooperative, also examined his mistakes and expressed his determination to implement the policy resolutely. Next, the branch explained to the Party members the specific policies of land shares in the cooperative, the proportion of land and labor distribution, and how to handle cattle and farm tools.

    After studying, the Party members' awareness was raised and their eyes were brightened. Among the 48 Party members in the township, the number of people actively running cooperatives increased from 34 to 44, and the number of wavering people decreased from 12 to only 4, while the number of people who firmly stated that they would not join the cooperative remained at 2.

         ÃÃÃÃ

    With the Party's thinking unified, the branch saw the current new situation clearly: on the one hand, a large number of problems must be solved through planning, and on the other hand, the masses have already taken action and urgently need to strengthen leadership immediately, and it is not allowed to "go slowly." In order to adapt to this new situation, the branch decided to develop new cooperatives while carrying out planning.

    1. The branch classified the masses according to their different attitudes towards cooperation. Among the 403 poor and middle peasant households in the township who have not yet joined the cooperatives, 288 households are actively requesting to join the cooperatives, but their degree of enthusiasm varies. Among them, 226 households have a very firm attitude, and 62 households are following the crowd. Among the 403 poor and middle peasant households, 102 households are still hesitating and want to see how the land is assessed, how the grain is distributed, and how the cattle and farm tools are handled before deciding whether to join the cooperative, and 13 households said that they want to wait a few years before deciding. Through classification, the branch decided to develop 10 new cooperatives this year, with a total of 245 households. The original 6 old cooperatives will absorb 72 new members, and the number of peasant households joining the cooperatives in the township will reach 508, accounting for 78.3% of the total households. For the remaining 73 households who are temporarily unwilling to join the cooperatives but are willing to join mutual aid teams, it is planned to organize 5 mutual aid teams. The 13 households who said they would not join the cooperatives or mutual aid teams will be allowed to wait and see. The 55 landlord and rich peasant households will definitely not be absorbed at present.

    2. Analyze the situation of the existing backbone. The branch believes that there are enough backbone members, but their distribution is uneven; the most important problem is that it has neglected the cultivation of new forces. Therefore, it must be clear: wherever the masses demand to establish a cooperative, there will be backbone members. There are 48 Party members in the township, and 73 members of the Communist Youth League, of which 64 expressed their active support for cooperation. In addition, there are 128 activists who have emerged in various movements, of which 102 expressed their active support for cooperation. Through classification, the backbone was adjusted according to the principle of "matching people with land"; and it was decided to cultivate new backbone in the movement, and prepare to individually absorb those who meet the conditions into the Party and the League.

    3. Draw a clear class distinction of who to rely on, who to unite, and who to restrict. Clarify who should be absorbed first and who should be absorbed later, so as to implement the principle of voluntarism in the movement. Also specifically study the class composition of the members and backbone of the old cooperatives and the cooperatives currently being established; and make specific arrangements for the 36 poor peasant households who were originally excluded from the cooperatives.

    When conducting preliminary planning, a few Party members still could not clearly distinguish the class boundaries. For example, Liu Fucheng, the village chief of Ludang Village and the chairman of the Ludang Cooperative, reported his neighbor, the rich peasant Zhou Yungao, as an upper-middle peasant, and said: "This honest man can join the cooperative." In response to this situation, the branch repeatedly carried out education on class policy among Party members, and exposed the specific facts of the various sabotage activities of the rich peasants in the township.

    After the preliminary planning was done well, the Party members went back to conduct individual contact with the League members and activists. Then, each village convened meetings of Party members, League members, and activists to discuss the preliminary plan proposed by the branch; and jointly discuss who will establish a cooperative this year, and who will temporarily remain in the mutual aid team to do a good job in the mutual aid team and strive to establish a cooperative in the future. After reaching a consensus, everyone studied the specific problems in the work of establishing cooperatives and rectifying and improving mutual aid teams.

    The opinions of the Party members, League members, and activists were unified, and the policies and methods of running cooperatives were also learned. Then, they used various methods such as holding various forums, home visits, and talking on the ground to conduct publicity and education on the issue of cooperation among the masses. At the same time, more than 270 people from the township were organized to visit the old cooperatives; and 73 members of various kinds from the old cooperatives were mobilized to speak from their own experience to the masses, widely publicizing the superiority of the cooperatives. In the propaganda, special emphasis was placed on explaining the policy of voluntary mutual benefit, the principle of poor and middle peasants uniting to take the socialist road, and exposing the sabotage activities of landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries. As a result, some confused ideas among the masses were clarified, and the enthusiasm of the masses for establishing cooperatives was encouraged. At this time, the number of peasant households in the township requesting to join the cooperatives increased from the original 288 to 390. Wang Jijun, a middle peasant, has 12 mu of good land, 3 full laborers, 2 half laborers, and a foreign windmill. When the cooperative was established last year, he firmly stated that he would not participate and wanted to "compare" before deciding. Now, after hearing that Xu Huaibao, who has the same conditions as him, increased his grain income by more than 2,000 jin after joining the cooperative, he said that he had "waited in vain for a year" and expressed his firm desire to join the cooperative. Chen Guiwang, a new middle peasant who originally excluded poor peasants from joining the cooperative, understood the principle that poor peasants have great land potential and sufficient labor, and middle peasants have cattle and farm tools, and that cooperation is the best of both worlds. He happily mobilized three poor peasant households who had been excluded by him in the past to rejoin the cooperative and made a self-criticism to them.

    After the cooperative planning was fully deliberated and discussed among the masses, the branch enriched and revised the plan based on the opinions of the masses. For example, the original plan was to establish new cooperatives and join old cooperatives with 317 households. Based on the demands of the masses, 8 households were added. There were two mutual aid teams with a total of 38 households in Wugang Village. The branch originally planned to establish two cooperatives based on these two teams. After discussion by the masses, the branch finally decided that some people from the two teams would join the old cooperatives, and some people would be left behind to establish a cooperative. Everyone was very satisfied. On the basis of the cooperative planning, a total of nine new cooperatives were established in the township. There was also a cooperative that was not fully mature, so a framework was built first, and it will be officially established when conditions are mature. The six old cooperatives have also been expanded.

    The overall cooperation plan has also been determined: before the autumn planting in 1955, including the existing old cooperatives, a total of 16 cooperatives will be established, with 516 peasant households joining, accounting for 79.5% of the total households. Among them, 410 poor peasants and new and old middle peasants of the lower-middle peasant class account for 92% of the peasant households of this class (446 households); 106 new and old middle peasants of the upper-middle peasant class account for 71.6% of the peasant households of this class (148 households). A total of 3 mutual aid teams were organized, with 58 households, accounting for 8.9% of the total households, of which 27 were poor peasants and lower-middle peasants, and 31 were old upper-middle peasants. There are 19 individual farmers, of which 8 are poor peasants and new and old lower-middle peasants, and 11 are upper-middle peasants. There are 55 individual landlords and rich peasants.

    In 1956, no new cooperatives will be established. It is planned to expand the existing cooperatives and absorb another 58 households. Among them, 27 are poor peasants and new and old lower-middle peasants, and 31 are old upper-middle peasants. The total number of peasant households joining the cooperatives in the township will reach 574, accounting for 88.4% of the total households.

    After the new cooperatives were largely established, the branch concentrated its efforts to help the six old cooperatives formulate plans for further developing production; helped the new cooperatives establish labor organizations, divide farming areas, and formulate small-scale production plans. At the same time, a mutual aid and cooperation network was established, with the Ludang old cooperative as the base point to drive 15 cooperatives, and it was determined that the Ludang No. 1 Cooperative, Niaogang, Zhangli and other three cooperatives would lead three mutual aid teams respectively, specifically helping the mutual aid teams strengthen production management and do a good job in production. The 19 individual farmers were also assigned to the cooperatives where they are located to be responsible for helping them.

    Through overall planning, the Party's cooperation policy was implemented, and the socialist awareness of Party members, cadres, and the masses was raised. A large number of activists were cultivated in the planning and establishment of cooperatives, and two activists who met the conditions of Party membership were absorbed into the Party. Now all the cadres in the township are confidently continuing to lead the work of running cooperatives in accordance with the cooperative planning, and are conducting comprehensive planning including agricultural production.
