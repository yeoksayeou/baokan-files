Actively and Systematically Carry Out the Agricultural Cooperation Movement
Implement the Policy of "Overall Planning, Strengthening Leadership"
Hua Jun

    Xin Sheng Township in Yancheng County, Jiangsu Province, has a total of five villages and 649 households. Among them, there are 288 poor peasant households, 158 new and old lower-middle peasant households, 148 new and old upper-middle peasant households, 49 rich peasant households, and 6 landlord households. This spring, the township established six agricultural production cooperatives, with 191 peasant households joining, accounting for 29.4% of the total households. The township has 15 permanent mutual aid teams and 8 temporary mutual aid teams, with 343 peasant households participating, accounting for 52.85% of the total households.

    This autumn, the six cooperatives generally had bumper harvests, with an average increase of 13% compared to before the establishment of the cooperatives, and nearly 10% more than the surrounding mutual aid teams. The superiority of cooperation attracted peasants outside the cooperatives. Fifteen permanent mutual aid teams in the township were actively preparing to establish cooperatives, and five temporary mutual aid teams and some individual farmers requested to join the cooperatives. A total of 288 households in the township had "registered" with the Party branch, requesting to establish new cooperatives or join old ones. A high tide of cooperation has already formed.

    Due to insufficient understanding of the new situation of the arrival of the high tide, the Party branch initially acted according to the original plan, limiting its work to the circle of eight typical mutual aid teams that were originally prepared to establish cooperatives. As a result, the leadership failed to keep up with the development of the movement and was once in a passive state. Therefore, in the spontaneous activities of the masses preparing to establish cooperatives, the following problems arose:

    1. Excluding poor peasants from joining the cooperatives. Some middle peasants, and even a few Party members and cadres, wanted to establish cooperatives with people who were "equally matched," believing that "with complete farm tools and sufficient cattle, the cooperative can be run well." They thought that absorbing poor peasants would result in "losses" and "more difficulties, and the cooperative would not be run well." For example, the Lu Zhengfa mutual aid team in Ludang Village (a total of 12 poor peasant households) had requested to join the cooperative last winter and this spring, but the branch did not agree. Now they are requesting to join the Ludang No. 1 Cooperative, and some members have submitted reports applying three or four times, but they have been rejected by Bian Xuelong (a Party member), the vice-chairman of the cooperative. While rejecting poor peasants from joining the cooperative, Bian Xuelong went to absorb three rich peasant households: Yuan Xuezhong, Ni Jigen, and Yuan Junfa. Team leader Lu Zhengfa angrily stated: "If they don't want us, we will organize a 'poor people's' cooperative." When establishing a cooperative in Zhangli Village, some middle peasants were unwilling to be with poor peasants and wanted to organize a "middle peasant cooperative" separately. A total of 36 poor peasant households in the township were excluded from joining the cooperatives.

    2. Competing for the backbone of cooperative establishment. After the full-scale development of the cooperation movement, the existing backbone seemed to be few and unevenly distributed because the branch did not pay attention to discovering and cultivating new activists. Some cadres with poor work styles in the past were unwilling to be elected by the masses as "heads of the household." Therefore, there was competition for good backbone. At that time, there were five mutual aid teams in the township that were preparing to establish cooperatives, but they could not be established because they lacked leadership backbone. The mutual aid team in the west of Chen She Village, Chen She Zhuang, was preparing to establish a cooperative. Because there was no accountant, the team leader ran to the mutual aid team in the east of the village at night to mobilize Li Huaiming and pull him out to be the accountant, which caused dissatisfaction among the members of the eastern team. The members of this team said: Whether you're a person or a ghost, you dragged away our team's good accountant at night. The Han Yuliang mutual aid team originally had 25 households actively requesting to establish a cooperative. The branch planned to recommend Party member Han Shigao (who had a very bad work style and was the dismissed village chief) as the chairman of the cooperative. The team members' enthusiasm quickly declined, and seven households jumped to other teams.

    3. Individual farmers are left unattended. Township staff only focused on leading eight typical mutual aid teams to establish cooperatives, and some poor peasants who were excluded from joining the cooperatives had no one to lead their production. Liu Jirong, a poor peasant in Wugang Village, was not active in production because he could not join the cooperative. The Wang Zhaojun mutual aid team in Chen She Village had 11 poor peasant households who allowed 31 mu of paddy fields to dry up. They said: We are not happy to produce without a cooperative. We will be more energetic when the cooperative is established. Some upper-middle peasants who are currently unwilling to join the cooperative are uneasy: they are afraid of raising their class status; they are afraid of increasing production during unified grain purchase; they are afraid that the government will treat them differently. No one has bothered to ask about these issues.

    4. Landlords and rich peasants take the opportunity to sabotage. Some landlords and rich peasants "beg" township staff to join the cooperatives, attempting to "sneak in" and sabotage. Some used methods such as bribery, instigation, and threats, attempting to "pull out" peasants who had already requested to join the cooperatives. Li Hongtai and Sun Shujin, rich peasants in Chen She Village, used the method of paying wages in advance to win over 11 households including Li Huairen and Li Huaicai, saying: It's better for one person to beat a dog than for ten people to kill a cow. Sun Hongcheng, a rich peasant in Zhangli Village, threatened Dai Xuelou, a Party member who did not allow him to join the cooperative, saying: "What feud do I have with you?" and said: "I'll have my day as long as you have yours."

    5. The Party branch also has divided opinions on agricultural cooperation. Most of the 48 Party members in the township actively support the establishment of cooperatives and are very enthusiastic. The branch secretary, Wei Chengxuan, believes that the masses' demands for establishing cooperatives should be actively supported. However, a few Party members believe that it should be done "slowly" and "steadily." For example, Party member Li Huaihe said: "It is not easy to lead if the pace is too fast." Thirty-four households in the mutual aid team he led requested to join the cooperative, but he only agreed to 24 households. Individual Party members with relatively wealthy lives hide behind the masses and are unwilling to join the cooperative. Party member Han Shihe, seeing that the surrounding masses were taking action, was afraid of not being able to "escape" at home and requested the branch to approve him to work on the river project. Party member Chen Jinshu said: "There are no conditions now, let's wait one or two years. I will definitely not participate this year."

    With the help of the higher-level Party committee, the branch earnestly studied Comrade Mao Zedong's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation," summarized the experience of establishing cooperatives in the township, saw the concrete facts of the superiority of agricultural cooperatives, and criticized the passive emotions and spontaneous capitalist tendencies of some Party members. Party members who had erroneous understandings of cooperation all examined their erroneous thinking. Xu Bulian, a member of the branch committee and director of the township credit cooperative, used to excuse himself by saying he was "busy with work" and had no time to run agricultural cooperatives. Now he confessed: "It's not that I'm busy, it's that my thinking is wrong. From today onwards, I will wholeheartedly participate in running agricultural cooperatives." Liu Zhengyuan, a demobilized soldier and Party member, initially wavered because his mother was unwilling to join the cooperative. Now he expressed his determination to persuade his mother and proposed to take out his 120 yuan demobilization fund as an investment in joining the cooperative. On the basis of a unified understanding of cooperation, education on class policy was carried out, and the erroneous thinking of excluding poor peasants was criticized. Party members who had excluded poor peasants or wanted to let rich peasants join the cooperatives all made self-criticisms. Party member Lü Jinbang said: "Originally, I only saw the rich peasants' cattle and farm tools, but I didn't see the class essence of the rich peasants; I only saw 'many difficulties' for the poor peasants, and I forgot that they are the force to rely on. Now I understand." Bian Xuelong, the Party member who originally attempted to absorb rich peasants and exclude poor peasants from joining the cooperative, also examined his mistakes and expressed his determination to implement the policy resolutely. Next, the branch explained to the Party members the specific policies of land shares in the cooperative, the proportion of land and labor distribution, and how to handle cattle and farm tools.

    After studying, the Party members' awareness was raised and their eyes were brightened. Among the 48 Party members in the township, the number of people actively running cooperatives increased from 34 to 44, and the number of wavering people decreased from 12 to only 4, while the number of people who firmly stated that they would not join the cooperative remained at 2.

         ××××

    With the Party's thinking unified, the branch saw the current new situation clearly: on the one hand, a large number of problems must be solved through planning, and on the other hand, the masses have already taken action and urgently need to strengthen leadership immediately, and it is not allowed to "go slowly." In order to adapt to this new situation, the branch decided to develop new cooperatives while carrying out planning.

    1. The branch classified the masses according to their different attitudes towards cooperation. Among the 403 poor and middle peasant households in the township who have not yet joined the cooperatives, 288 households are actively requesting to join the cooperatives, but their degree of enthusiasm varies. Among them, 226 households have a very firm attitude, and 62 households are following the crowd. Among the 403 poor and middle peasant households, 102 households are still hesitating and want to see how the land is assessed, how the grain is distributed, and how the cattle and farm tools are handled before deciding whether to join the cooperative, and 13 households said that they want to wait a few years before deciding. Through classification, the branch decided to develop 10 new cooperatives this year, with a total of 245 households. The original 6 old cooperatives will absorb 72 new members, and the number of peasant households joining the cooperatives in the township will reach 508, accounting for 78.3% of the total households. For the remaining 73 households who are temporarily unwilling to join the cooperatives but are willing to join mutual aid teams, it is planned to organize 5 mutual aid teams. The 13 households who said they would not join the cooperatives or mutual aid teams will be allowed to wait and see. The 55 landlord and rich peasant households will definitely not be absorbed at present.

    2. Analyze the situation of the existing backbone. The branch believes that there are enough backbone members, but their distribution is uneven; the most important problem is that it has neglected the cultivation of new forces. Therefore, it must be clear: wherever the masses demand to establish a cooperative, there will be backbone members. There are 48 Party members in the township, and 73 members of the Communist Youth League, of which 64 expressed their active support for cooperation. In addition, there are 128 activists who have emerged in various movements, of which 102 expressed their active support for cooperation. Through classification, the backbone was adjusted according to the principle of "matching people with land"; and it was decided to cultivate new backbone in the movement, and prepare to individually absorb those who meet the conditions into the Party and the League.

    3. Draw a clear class distinction of who to rely on, who to unite, and who to restrict. Clarify who should be absorbed first and who should be absorbed later, so as to implement the principle of voluntarism in the movement. Also specifically study the class composition of the members and backbone of the old cooperatives and the cooperatives currently being established; and make specific arrangements for the 36 poor peasant households who were originally excluded from the cooperatives.

    When conducting preliminary planning, a few Party members still could not clearly distinguish the class boundaries. For example, Liu Fucheng, the village chief of Ludang Village and the chairman of the Ludang Cooperative, reported his neighbor, the rich peasant Zhou Yungao, as an upper-middle peasant, and said: "This honest man can join the cooperative." In response to this situation, the branch repeatedly carried out education on class policy among Party members, and exposed the specific facts of the various sabotage activities of the rich peasants in the township.

    After the preliminary planning was done well, the Party members went back to conduct individual contact with the League members and activists. Then, each village convened meetings of Party members, League members, and activists to discuss the preliminary plan proposed by the branch; and jointly discuss who will establish a cooperative this year, and who will temporarily remain in the mutual aid team to do a good job in the mutual aid team and strive to establish a cooperative in the future. After reaching a consensus, everyone studied the specific problems in the work of establishing cooperatives and rectifying and improving mutual aid teams.

    The opinions of the Party members, League members, and activists were unified, and the policies and methods of running cooperatives were also learned. Then, they used various methods such as holding various forums, home visits, and talking on the ground to conduct publicity and education on the issue of cooperation among the masses. At the same time, more than 270 people from the township were organized to visit the old cooperatives; and 73 members of various kinds from the old cooperatives were mobilized to speak from their own experience to the masses, widely publicizing the superiority of the cooperatives. In the propaganda, special emphasis was placed on explaining the policy of voluntary mutual benefit, the principle of poor and middle peasants uniting to take the socialist road, and exposing the sabotage activities of landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries. As a result, some confused ideas among the masses were clarified, and the enthusiasm of the masses for establishing cooperatives was encouraged. At this time, the number of peasant households in the township requesting to join the cooperatives increased from the original 288 to 390. Wang Jijun, a middle peasant, has 12 mu of good land, 3 full laborers, 2 half laborers, and a foreign windmill. When the cooperative was established last year, he firmly stated that he would not participate and wanted to "compare" before deciding. Now, after hearing that Xu Huaibao, who has the same conditions as him, increased his grain income by more than 2,000 jin after joining the cooperative, he said that he had "waited in vain for a year" and expressed his firm desire to join the cooperative. Chen Guiwang, a new middle peasant who originally excluded poor peasants from joining the cooperative, understood the principle that poor peasants have great land potential and sufficient labor, and middle peasants have cattle and farm tools, and that cooperation is the best of both worlds. He happily mobilized three poor peasant households who had been excluded by him in the past to rejoin the cooperative and made a self-criticism to them.

    After the cooperative planning was fully deliberated and discussed among the masses, the branch enriched and revised the plan based on the opinions of the masses. For example, the original plan was to establish new cooperatives and join old cooperatives with 317 households. Based on the demands of the masses, 8 households were added. There were two mutual aid teams with a total of 38 households in Wugang Village. The branch originally planned to establish two cooperatives based on these two teams. After discussion by the masses, the branch finally decided that some people from the two teams would join the old cooperatives, and some people would be left behind to establish a cooperative. Everyone was very satisfied. On the basis of the cooperative planning, a total of nine new cooperatives were established in the township. There was also a cooperative that was not fully mature, so a framework was built first, and it will be officially established when conditions are mature. The six old cooperatives have also been expanded.

    The overall cooperation plan has also been determined: before the autumn planting in 1955, including the existing old cooperatives, a total of 16 cooperatives will be established, with 516 peasant households joining, accounting for 79.5% of the total households. Among them, 410 poor peasants and new and old middle peasants of the lower-middle peasant class account for 92% of the peasant households of this class (446 households); 106 new and old middle peasants of the upper-middle peasant class account for 71.6% of the peasant households of this class (148 households). A total of 3 mutual aid teams were organized, with 58 households, accounting for 8.9% of the total households, of which 27 were poor peasants and lower-middle peasants, and 31 were old upper-middle peasants. There are 19 individual farmers, of which 8 are poor peasants and new and old lower-middle peasants, and 11 are upper-middle peasants. There are 55 individual landlords and rich peasants.

    In 1956, no new cooperatives will be established. It is planned to expand the existing cooperatives and absorb another 58 households. Among them, 27 are poor peasants and new and old lower-middle peasants, and 31 are old upper-middle peasants. The total number of peasant households joining the cooperatives in the township will reach 574, accounting for 88.4% of the total households.

    After the new cooperatives were largely established, the branch concentrated its efforts to help the six old cooperatives formulate plans for further developing production; helped the new cooperatives establish labor organizations, divide farming areas, and formulate small-scale production plans. At the same time, a mutual aid and cooperation network was established, with the Ludang old cooperative as the base point to drive 15 cooperatives, and it was determined that the Ludang No. 1 Cooperative, Niaogang, Zhangli and other three cooperatives would lead three mutual aid teams respectively, specifically helping the mutual aid teams strengthen production management and do a good job in production. The 19 individual farmers were also assigned to the cooperatives where they are located to be responsible for helping them.

    Through overall planning, the Party's cooperation policy was implemented, and the socialist awareness of Party members, cadres, and the masses was raised. A large number of activists were cultivated in the planning and establishment of cooperatives, and two activists who met the conditions of Party membership were absorbed into the Party. Now all the cadres in the township are confidently continuing to lead the work of running cooperatives in accordance with the cooperative planning, and are conducting comprehensive planning including agricultural production.

    积极地有计划地开展农业合作化运动
    执行“全面规划、加强领导”的方针
    华俊
    江苏省盐城县新生乡，共五个村，六百四十九户。其中贫农二百八十八户，新、老下中农共一百五十八户，新、老上中农共一百四十八户，富农四十九户，地主六户。这个乡今年春天办了六个农业生产合作社，入社农户一百九十一户，占总农户的百分之二十九点四。全乡有常年互助组十五个，临时互助组八个，入组农户三百四十三户，占总农户的百分之五十二点八五。
    今年秋天，六个合作社普遍丰收，平均比办社前增产一成三，比周围互助组多收近一成。合作化的优越性吸引社外农民，全乡十五个常年互助组积极酝酿办社，有五个临时互助组和部分单干农民要求入社。全乡有二百八十八户向党支部“挂号”，要求建立新社或参加老社。合作化的高潮已经形成。
    党支部由于对高潮到来的新情况认识不足，最初，还是根据原来的计划办事，工作局限在原来准备建社的八个典型互助组的圈子里，以致领导没有赶上运动的发展，一度陷于被动状态。因此，在群众自发酝酿办社的活动中，产生了以下问题：
    一、排斥贫农入社。有部分中农，甚至少数党员和干部要“肩膀子一样齐”的人在一起办社，认为“农具全、耕牛足，社才能办得好”，吸收了贫农入社，自己会“吃亏”，而且“困难多，社办不好”。如芦荡村吕正发互助组（共十二户贫农），去冬今春都曾要求入社，支部没有同意，现在又要求参加芦荡一支社，有的组员打报告申请了三、四次，被这个社的副社长卞学龙（党员）拒绝了。卞学龙一方面拒绝贫农入社，一方面却去吸收富农袁学忠、倪继根、袁俊法等三户入社。组长吕正发气愤地表示：“不要我们，我们就组织‘穷人’社。”张李村建社时，有些中农不肯和贫农在一起，要单独组织“中农社”。全乡要求入社而被排挤的贫农即达三十六户。
    二、争夺办社骨干。在合作化运动全面展开以后，由于支部没有注意发现和培养新的积极分子，原有的骨干就显得少了，而且分布得不匀，一些过去作风不好的干部，群众又不愿选他们做“当家人”，因而，好的骨干就你争我夺。当时全乡有五个准备建社的互助组，其他条件都够，就是没有领导骨干而办不起来。陈舍村陈舍庄西头的互助组准备建社，因为没有会计，组长晚上跑到东头的互助组去动员李怀明，拉他出来当会计，引起了东头组的不满，这个组的组员说：做人还是做鬼，夜里把我组的好会计拖走了。韩玉亮互助组原来有二十五户积极要求办社，支部准备推荐党员韩仕高（作风很不好，是被撤职的村长）去当社长，组员情绪很快就低落下来，有七户跳到别组去了。
    三、单干农民没人管。乡的工作人员只顾领导八个典型互助组办社，一部分要求入社而被排挤在社外的贫困农民，生产无人领导。乌港村贫农刘继容因不得入社，不积极生产。陈舍村王兆俊互助组有十一户贫农，任凭三十一亩水田干掉，他们说：不办社，不高兴生产，社办起来才来劲。一些目前还不愿入社的上中农心里不安：怕提高成份；怕粮食统购的时候加大产量；怕政府两样看待。这些问题也没人去过问。
    四、地主、富农乘机破坏。有的地主、富农向乡的工作人员“央求”入社，企图“钻进来”破坏。有的用利诱、挑拨、威胁等办法，企图把已要求入社的农民“拉出去”。陈舍村富农李宏太、孙书金以预付工资的办法，拉拢李怀仁、李怀才等十一户说：十个人杀条牛，不如一人打条狗。张李村富农孙宏成，威胁不许他入社的党员待学楼说：“我和你有什么仇？”并说：“有你一天，也有我一天。”
    五、支部内部对农业合作化的意见也不统一。全乡四十八个党员，多数积极拥护办社，劲头很足，支部书记韦成选认为应该积极支持群众的办社要求。但也有少数党员则认为要“慢慢来”，“稳点好”。如党员李怀和说：“步子跨大了，不容易领导。”他领导的互助组有三十四户要求入社，他只同意二十四户。个别生活较富裕的党员，躲在群众后头，不愿入社。党员韩仕和，看见周围群众都行动起来了，怕在家里“逃不了”，要求支部批准他去做河工。党员陈金书说：“现在没条件，等一、二年再说，今年坚决不参加。”
    支部在上级党委的帮助下，认真地学习了毛泽东同志“关于农业合作化问题”的报告，总结了本乡办社的经验，看到了农业合作社的优越性的具体事实，批判了一些党员的消极情绪和资本主义自发倾向。对合作化有错误认识的党员，都检讨了自己的错误思想。支部委员徐步连是乡的信用社主任，过去借口“工作忙”，说没功夫办农业合作社，现在检讨说：“不是忙，是思想不对头，从今天起要一心一意参加办农业合作社。”转业军人、党员刘正元，开始因为母亲不愿入社，自己也动摇，现在表示决心打通母亲思想，并提出把一百二十元转业金拿出来作为入社的投资。在对合作化有了统一认识的基础上，进行了阶级政策的教育，批判了排斥贫农的错误思想。曾经排斥贫农或想让富农入社的党员都作了检讨。党员吕金榜说：“原来只看见富农的耕牛、农具，看不到富农的阶级本质；对贫农只看见‘困难多’，忘记了是依靠力量。这下子明白了。”原来企图吸收富农、排斥贫农入社的党员卞学龙，也检讨了错误，表示坚决执行政策。接着，支部又把合作社的土地入股，土地劳力分配比例，耕牛、农具如何处理等的具体政策向党员作了说明。
    经过学习，党员的觉悟提高了，眼睛擦亮了。全乡四十八个党员中，原来积极办社的三十四人，动摇的十二人，表示坚决不入社的二人，现在积极办社的增加到四十四人，犹豫不定的只有四人。
         ××××
    党内的思想统一了，支部就看清了当前的新情况：一方面是一大堆问题必须通过规划才能解决，另方面群众已经动起来了，亟需立即加强领导，不允许“慢慢来”。为了适应这个新情况，支部确定，一面进行规划，一面发展新社。
    一、支部根据群众对合作化的不同态度进行了排队。全乡还没有入社的四百零三户贫农、中农，有二百八十八户积极要求入社，但是积极的程度不一，其中态度十分坚决的二百二十六户，随大流的六十二户。在四百零三户贫农、中农中，现在还犹豫不决、要看看土地如何评产、粮食如何分配、耕牛农具如何处理再决定入不入社的有一百零二户，表示要等几年再说的有十三户。通过排队，支部确定今年再发展十个新社，共二百四十五户，原有六个老社再吸收新社员七十二户，全乡入社农户达五百零八户，占总农户的百分之七十八点三。对其余暂不入社但愿入组的七十三户，计划组织五个互助组。对表示不入社也不入组的十三户，决定再让他们等
  一等。对五十五户地主、富农，目前坚决不吸收。
    二、分析了现有骨干的情况。支部认为，骨干是足够的，就是分布不匀；最主要的问题是忽视了对新生力量的培养，因此，必须明确：哪里有群众要求办社，哪里就有骨干。全乡有党员四十八人，还有青年团员七十三人，其中对合作化表示积极拥护的有六十四人。另外，还有在各种运动中涌现出来的积极分子一百二十八人，其中对合作化表示积极拥护的一百零二人。通过排队，根据“人地相宜”的原则，对骨干作了调整；并确定在运动中培养新的骨干，准备个别吸收够条件的人入党、入团。
    三、划清了依靠谁、团结谁、限制谁的阶级界限。弄清了应先吸收谁，后吸收谁，以便在运动中贯彻执行自愿原则。又具体研究了老社和目前正在建立的社的社员和骨干的阶级成份；并把原来被排挤在社外的三十六户贫农，具体作了安排。
    在进行初步规划的时候，有少数党员对阶级界限还是划不清，如芦荡村村长、芦荡社社长刘福成，把邻居富农周云高报为上中农，并且说：“这个老实人，可以入社。”支部针对这种情况，又在党员中间反复进行了阶级政策的教育，揭露了本乡富农的各种破坏活动的具体事实。
    初步规划搞好后，党员回去在团员和积极分子中进行了个别串连。接着各村分别召开了党员、团员和积极分子会议，讨论支部提出的初步规划；并共同协商谁今年办社，谁暂时留在互助组内搞好互助组，争取今后办社。在取得一致意见以后，大家又研究了办社和整顿提高互助组等工作中的具体问题。
    党员、团员、积极分子的意见统一了，办社的政策和方法也学会了。接着就通过他们用召开各种座谈会、家庭访问、地头谈心等方式在群众中进行关于合作化问题的宣传教育。同时，又组织全乡群众二百七十多人去老社参观访问；动员老社的各种成员七十三人到群众中现身说法，广泛地宣传合作社的优越性。在宣传中，特别着重讲清自愿互利政策，贫、中农团结走社会主义道路的道理，并揭露地主、富农、反革命分子的破坏活动。结果，澄清了群众中的一些糊涂思想，鼓舞了群众的办社热情。这时全乡要求入社的农户由原来的二百八十八户增加到了三百九十户。中农王吉俊，有十二亩好田，三个整劳力，二个半劳力，一部洋风车，去年办社的时候表示坚决不参加，要“比一比”再说，现在听见和他条件相同的徐怀宝入社后，粮食收入增加二千多斤，说自己“空等了一年”，表示坚决要入社。原来排斥贫农入社的新中农陈桂望，了解了贫农土地潜力大，劳力足，中农有耕牛，有农具，合作起来两全其美的道理后，愉快地动员过去被他排挤的三户贫农重新入社，并且向他们作了检讨。
    合作化规划在群众中进行充分酝酿讨论以后，支部根据群众意见，充实和修改了规划。例如原来计划办新社和入老社的是三百一十七户，根据群众的要求，又增加了八户。乌港村有二个互助组共三十八户，支部原来计划以这两个组作基础办两个社，经过群众讨论，支部最后确定两个组一部分人加入老社，留下一部分人建立一个社。大家都很满意。在合作化规划的基础上，全乡共建立了九个新社。还有一个社因条件没有完全成熟，先搭起了一个架子，等条件成熟后就正式建立。六个老社也扩大了。
    合作化的全面规划也定出来了：一九五五年秋种以前，连原有老社在内共办社十六个，入社农户五百一十六户，占总农户的百分之七十九点五。其中贫农、新老中农的下中农四百一十户，占本阶层农户（四百四十六户）的百分之九十二；新、老中农的上中农共一百零六户，占本阶层农户（一百四十八户）的百分之七十一点六。共组织互助组三个，五十八户，占总农户的百分之八点九，其中贫农和下中农二十七户，老上中农三十一户。单干农民十九户，其中贫农和新老下中农八户，上中农十一户。单干的地主富农五十五户。
    一九五六年，不再办新社，计划扩大原有的社，再吸收五十八户。其中贫农和新老下中农二十七户，老上中农三十一户。全乡入社的农户就达到五百七十四户，占总户口的百分之八十八点四。
    在新社大体建成以后，支部就集中力量分别帮助六个老社订出进一步发展生产的计划；帮助新社建立了劳动组织，划分了耕作区，制定了小段生产计划。同时，建立了互助合作网，以芦荡老社为基点社，带动十五个社，并确定芦荡一支社、鸟港、张李等三社分别带动三个互助组，具体帮助互助组加强生产管理，搞好生产。十九户单干农民也分别确定所在地的合作社负责帮助。
    通过全面规划，贯彻执行了党的合作化方针、政策，党员、干部、群众的社会主义觉悟提高了。在规划和建社中培养了大批积极分子，并吸收了两个够党员条件的积极分子入了党，现在全乡干部正满怀信心地按照合作化规划继续领导办社工作，并且正在进行包括农业生产等方面的全面规划。
