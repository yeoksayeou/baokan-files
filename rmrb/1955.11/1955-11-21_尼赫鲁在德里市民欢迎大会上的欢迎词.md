Nehru's Welcome Speech at the Delhi Civic Reception

　　Five months ago, I visited the Soviet Union. Today, we welcome two very prominent Soviet leaders in the capital of India. In Moscow, I discussed many issues with the Soviet leaders, and this time we will also discuss those issues of common concern.

　　However, my visit to the Soviet Union and Mr. Bulganin and Mr. Khrushchev's visit to India are not merely meetings of leaders of two countries—no matter how important these meetings are. Such visits also contain a certain deeper and more far-reaching significance.

　　During my visit to the Soviet Union, I met with many, many Soviet people there, and they fully showed me their goodwill and kindness. Mr. Bulganin and Mr. Khrushchev have only been in Delhi for a little over a day, but they must have already felt a part of the warmth of our people's hospitality towards them. They will also visit other major cities in India, and I believe that they will be received everywhere with such goodwill and kindness. They will see millions of people among India's countless residents, and in the eyes of these millions, goodwill and kindness towards them and the Soviet people will be expressed.

　　It can be seen from this that this is not only a meeting of individuals (no matter how high the positions these individuals hold), but also a meeting of the people of two great countries, and this event has significant historical significance. Early yesterday morning, our distinguished guests departed from Tashkent for India. They flew over the high mountains and arrived in India that afternoon. The high mountain barriers that separate India from other countries to the north and northeast are no longer a wall isolating us. It has become a bond between our two countries. The importance of this also lies in the fact that it makes us clearly understand how interconnected the current world is. This interconnection and this interrelationship are not only due to geographical factors, not only due to the development of transportation, but also to a greater extent due to the exchange of ideas and understanding, which gradually makes the world a whole.

　　I deeply know that the current world is not a whole, and fear and suspicion have separated countries. However, we must all inevitably establish closer relationships with each other. We welcome this development of the situation, and we India are willing to open our doors and windows to the world so that the people of all countries can better understand each other, and every country can learn the good things of other countries, although they are different from each other in many ways.

　　There are far more things in common than differences. The main goal of mankind is the same for all of us. Therefore, we India have always demanded a strong and positive attitude towards peaceful coexistence in the past and present. Therefore, we ourselves dare to propose five principles to other countries (these five principles are called "Panchsheel" in India), which stipulate non-aggression, non-interference, mutual cooperation, and each country living in its own way without interference from other countries. I am proud that the Soviet government and people also agree with these five principles, and I believe that more and more countries will adopt these principles, because there is no other way for civilized human beings.

　　We in India follow the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi, an outstanding representative of our era, who called on us to get rid of hatred and violence, and called on us to form friendships with everyone while maintaining our beliefs and principles. We even dare to take this attitude towards those who do not agree with us, so we have a large number of friends in many countries, and I don’t think we have incurred any enemies. At least, we have no hostility towards any country.

　　The people of India treat the great Soviet people in this spirit, seeking their friendship and cooperation. We are simple people and have no idea of competing with any country. However, we intend to rebuild our country according to the socialist path we have chosen, so that everyone in India can fully enjoy the opportunity for progress.

　　In this regard, we believe that we can learn a lot from the Soviet Union's great achievements in many aspects of human activity.

　　There are many difficult problems in today's world, but we firmly believe that every problem can be solved through peaceful cooperation. We first advocate peace, because it is needed by us and the rest of the world, so whoever also works for peace is our comrade.

　　I personally do not need to add anything to express my welcome to our distinguished guests, because they have already seen this welcome in the enthusiastic and friendly eyes of our people.

### 尼赫鲁在德里市民欢迎大会上的欢迎词

　　尼赫鲁在德里市民欢迎大会上的欢迎词
    五个月前，我曾经访问了苏联。今天我们在印度的首都欢迎两位非常卓越的苏联领导人。在莫斯科，我跟苏联领导人讨论了许多问题，这次我们也将商讨共同关心的那些问题。
    但是，我的访问苏联以及布尔加宁先生和赫鲁晓夫先生的访问印度不仅仅是两个国家的领导人的会见——不管这是多么重要的会见。这种访问还包含着某种更深刻的和更深远的意义。
    在我访问苏联的时候，我在那里同许许多多的苏联人见了面，他们充分地向我表明了他们的好感和善意。布尔加宁先生和赫鲁晓夫先生在德里刚过了一昼夜多一些，但是，他们一定已经感觉到了我国人民对他们的盛情招待的热情的一部分。他们还要访问印度其他的大城市，我相信，他们到处都会受到这样充满好感和善意的接待。他们会看见印度无数居民中的几百万人，就在这几百万人的眼中，将表达出对他们以及对苏联人民的善意和好感。
    由此可见，这不仅是个别人士（不论这些人士担任多么高的职位）的会见，而且也是两个伟大国家的人民的会见，这件事是具有重大的历史意义的。昨天一清早，我们的贵宾们从塔什干动身前来印度。他们飞越高山，在当天的下午到达了印度。把印度同北方和东北方其他国家分隔开的高山障碍，不再是隔离我们的一堵墙了。它成为我们两个国家之间的纽带。这一点之所以重要，还因为它使我们清楚地了解，当前的世界有怎样的互相联系。这种互相联系和这种互相关系不仅是由于具有地理性质，不仅是由于交通工具的发展，而且在更大的程度上是由于思想交流和了解的结果，这种了解逐渐地使这个世界成为一个整体。
    我深切地知道，目前的世界并不是一个整体，恐惧和怀疑使得各国有了隔阂。但是，我们大家不可避免地要彼此建立更密切的关系。我们欢迎事态的这种发展，我们印度愿意向全世界敞开我们的门窗，以使各国人民之间更好地互相谅解，每一个国家能够学习其他国家的好的东西，尽管它们在许多方面彼此有所不同。
    共同一致的地方要比分歧的地方多得多。人类的主要目标对于我们大家是一致的。因此，我们印度过去和现在一直要求对和平共处采取有力的积极的态度。因此，我们自己敢于向其他国家提出五项原则（这五项原则在印度叫做“潘查希拉”），它规定互不侵犯、互不干涉、彼此合作、每一个国家按照自己的方式生活，不受别国的干涉。我引以为荣的是：苏联政府和人民也同意这五项原则，我相信，愈来愈多的国家将采纳这些原则，因为对于文明的人类是没有另外一条道路的。
    我们印度遵循着我们时代的杰出代表圣雄甘地的教导，他曾经号召我们摆脱憎恨和暴力，号召我们同所有人结成朋友，同时保持我们的信念和原则。我们甚至对那些不赞同我们的人也敢于采取这种态度，因此我们在许多国家有大批朋友，并且我认为没有招致敌人。至少，我们对任何国家是没有敌意的。
    印度人民本着这种精神对待伟大的苏联人民，寻求他们的友谊和合作。我们是朴实的人民，没有同任何国家进行竞争的思想。不过我们打算根据我们所选择的社会主义道路重建我们的国家，以便在印度每个人能够完全享有进步的机会。
    在这一方面我们认为，我们可以从苏联在人类活动的许多方面的伟大成就中学到不少东西。
    在今天的世界上存在着许多困难的问题，但是我们深信，每一个问题都可以通过和平的合作方法获得解决。我们首先拥护和平，因为它是我们和世界的其余部分所需要的，因此，凡是也为和平而努力的人，就是我们的同志。
    我个人没有必要再补充些什么话，来表示欢迎我们的贵宾，因为他们在我们人民的热情的和友好的目光中已经看到这种欢迎之意了。
