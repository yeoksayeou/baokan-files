The Second Meeting of the Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce concluded yesterday. Under the care and guidance of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, this meeting focused on discussing the issue of further developing the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. This discussion was timely. Our country's First Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy has been implemented for nearly three years. Socialist industry and commerce have seen tremendous development every year, and the superiority of the socialist economy and its dominance in the national economy have become increasingly evident. More and more people have realized that it is not only reasonable but also inevitable that our country will basically complete the transformation of private ownership of the means of production and build a socialist society in about three five-year plan periods. The socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce in our country has, on the basis of the work of the past few years, begun to enter a new stage of development this year, that is, the stage where many industries in various regions are separately carrying out overall joint state-private ownership, and this is urgently needed for the planned development of our country's national economy at this stage. In this situation, especially after the national agricultural cooperativization has entered a high tide, it is completely understandable that capitalists in industry and commerce express urgent concern about various principles, methods, and personal prospects in the socialist transformation. After the discussion at this meeting, and after the communication by the representatives who participated in this meeting after they return to their local areas, we believe that the understanding of industrialists and businessmen across the country may take a big step forward, and the work of transforming capitalist industry and commerce will also be carried out better.

Our country's policy of peacefully transforming capitalist industry and commerce was determined as early as the founding of the country in 1949. The basis for adopting this policy, politically speaking, is that our national bourgeoisie, in the people's democratic revolution against imperialism and feudalism, participated in the revolution to varying degrees or adopted a neutral attitude, and in participating in this revolution, they formed a united front with the working class; after the founding of the People's Republic of China, they also adopted the position of supporting the People's Republic of China and opposing imperialism and feudalism. Economically speaking, it is because our country's economy is backward, and the people's regime led by the working class needs to establish an economic alliance with the national bourgeoisie willing to accept state capitalism, so as to give play to the role of capitalist industry and commerce in benefiting the national economy and the people's livelihood within a certain period, maintain worker employment, and increase product supply; and through the form of state capitalism, it is also easy to use peaceful transformation methods to orderly incorporate these enterprises into the socialist track, avoiding losses caused by sudden changes. Our country has established a strong people's democratic regime led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance, established a powerful and constantly growing socialist economy, and received tremendous assistance from the powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, while the bourgeoisie's influence on peasants and other petty bourgeois is becoming smaller and smaller. The general trend is that accepting socialist transformation is the only bright road. Therefore, the Constitution of the People's Republic of China points out that "our country can eliminate exploitation and poverty through peaceful means and build a prosperous and happy socialist society," and stipulates that "the state, through the management of state administrative organs, the leadership of the state-owned economy, and the supervision of the masses of workers, uses the positive role of capitalist industry and commerce that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, restricts their negative role that is unfavorable to the national economy and the people's livelihood, encourages and guides them to transform into different forms of state capitalist economy, and gradually replaces capitalist private ownership with socialist ownership by the whole people."

Under the correct leadership of the People's Government, due to the efforts of state-owned economic organs, industrial and commercial administrative organs, and the masses of workers in private enterprises, and also due to the concerted efforts of organizations such as the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Democratic National Construction Association, and patriotic people in the industrial and commercial circles, due to the unity and education work carried out on the industrial and commercial circles, and also due to the necessary and serious struggle carried out on the industrial and commercial circles, for six years, our country's capitalist industry and commerce has not only made beneficial contributions to the country's economy and finance, but also made great progress in accepting socialist transformation. First, a large number of private industrial and commercial enterprises have been transformed into different forms of state capitalist economy. In the first half of this year, according to statistics from 22 provinces, the output value of processing and ordering has accounted for 78.8 percent of the total output value of private industry; and according to statistics from 12 large and medium-sized cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, the output value of processing and ordering has accounted for 85.3 percent of the total output value of private industry. The number of joint state-private industrial enterprises reached more than 1,900 in the first half of this year, and the ratio of the output value of joint state-private industry to the output value of private industry has almost reached 3 to 5. In terms of commerce, private major industries where state-owned and cooperative commercial enterprises have already mastered the sources of goods have basically been incorporated into the track of state capitalism. Secondly, the political situation of the industrial and commercial circles has also undergone great changes. Since the launch of the struggle against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy work and use of inferior materials, and theft of state economic intelligence in 1952, the situation of industrial and commercial circles committing the above-mentioned behaviors has been reduced and mitigated to varying degrees. Labor-capital relations in private enterprises have also generally improved, and worker supervision has been established in many enterprises. Many industrialists and businessmen in most cities regularly carry out political study, thus improving their understanding of the laws of social development, domestic and international current affairs, and the policies and decrees of the People's Government. What is especially worth noting is that under the six years of education by the People's Government, and under the work influence of organizations such as the Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, a group of patriotic and progressive elements have emerged in the industrial and commercial circles. They are not only willing to accept socialist transformation themselves, but also able to promote other industrialists and businessmen to accept transformation. They will form the core force of the industrial and commercial circles in the process of accepting socialist transformation.

But on the issue of carrying out socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, is everything going smoothly? Absolutely not. Transforming capitalist industry and commerce, and gradually replacing capitalist ownership with socialist ownership by the whole people, even if it is through peaceful means, is still a profound class struggle. It is impossible to imagine that it will not encounter the resistance of many people, and it is impossible to imagine that it will not be necessary to use the power of the state and the power of the masses to overcome the resistance of these people. There are still many illegal behaviors in the industrial and commercial circles, there are still some behaviors of oppressing workers and buying off workers, and there are still many behaviors of resisting socialist transformation. These behaviors all need to be opposed and stopped. All of these should arouse the serious attention of the working class, government workers, and all patriotic people. It is completely wrong to relax attention and lose vigilance regarding this aspect of the situation. But today's more important issue is that the work of the Party and the People's Government in transforming capitalist industry and commerce is still far from sufficient and still lags behind the needs and possibilities. Whether within the Communist Party, within the working class, or within the industrial and commercial circles, the publicity and education work regarding the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce has been done very little, and many ideological confusions have not been clarified. At the same time, the actual work of transforming capitalist industry and commerce has not yet aroused the universal attention of the relevant departments and all localities and cities across the country. The systematic transformation of the industrial and commercial circles, and the work of making overall arrangements and comprehensive plans for the pressing needs of national economic development in transforming private industry and commerce, is only just beginning.

It is necessary to adapt to the new economic and political situation, and strengthen the work of the Party and the People's Government in this regard.

First, we should earnestly unify the understanding within the Party and the working class. Transforming capitalist industry and commerce must rely on the working class. In order to fully mobilize the various forces of the working class to carry out this arduous task, we must first unify and correctly understand this issue among the vanguard of the working class and the broad masses of workers. It should be seen that there are still some people within the Party and the working class who doubt the policy of gradually and peacefully transforming capitalist industry and commerce; we must clearly explain the principles to them. From the perspective of principle, Marxism has never ruled out the possibility of capitalism peacefully transitioning to socialism under certain conditions. Marx had long believed that under certain conditions, it would be "most cost-effective" for the working class who had seized power to implement "redemption" to the bourgeoisie, in order to achieve the peaceful victory of socialism. When commenting on Marx's view, Lenin said: "Marx neither bound his hands nor the hands of future socialist revolutionaries regarding the forms, methods, and means of transformation. He understood very well how many new problems would arise during the transformation and how the entire situation would change, how frequently and drastically the entire situation would change during the transformation process." Lenin himself once attempted to reach socialism in Russia after the victory of the 1917 revolution through the transitional form of state capitalism. However, due to the international and domestic conditions in Russia at that time, the bourgeoisie adopted a hostile attitude towards the Soviet government, so Lenin's plan could not be realized on a large scale. The situation at that time forced the Soviet government to take the means of rapidly expropriating the means of production of the bourgeoisie. In today's People's Republic of China, due to the specific political and economic circumstances already mentioned earlier, it is most appropriate for our country's working class to implement "redemption" for the means of production of the bourgeoisie, and not to redeem it all at once, but gradually redeem it over a period of more than ten years. This method of redemption is that the working class, during this period, when producing to meet the needs of the people and the country, also distributes a portion of the profits to the bourgeoisie, instead of the state using a separate sum of money to redeem the means of production of the bourgeoisie. As everyone knows, the distribution of profits of capitalist enterprises in our country is divided into four parts: one part is the income tax collected by the state, another part is the welfare benefits enjoyed by the workers, and the third part is the public accumulation fund set up for the development of the enterprise. These three parts account for more than three-quarters of the enterprise's profits; the fourth part is the dividends distributed to the capitalists, which account for less than one-quarter. The income of capitalists does not seem to be very large, but according to national statistics, it amounts to several hundred million yuan per year. Accumulated over a period of more than ten years, it amounts to several billion yuan, which is completely sufficient to be used as the price to purchase all the means of production of the national bourgeoisie. The above is from the perspective of principle. Looking at it from the perspective of facts, the history of our country over the past six years has irrefutably proven that the policy of gradually and peacefully transforming capitalist industry and commerce is not only appropriate, but also fully effective. Are the changes in capitalist industry and commerce and industrialists and businessmen over the past six years, as we mentioned earlier, very small achievements, or very large achievements? Is it very slow progress, or very fast progress? There is no doubt that this should be said to be a very large achievement and very fast progress. It can be said that through the form of state capitalism, the original face of capitalist industry and commerce has been greatly changed. This kind of industry and commerce cannot but obey the management of the state, the leadership of the state-owned economy, and the supervision of the working class. This kind of industry and commerce now has one foot inside the threshold of socialism, and the other foot cannot but follow in. Whoever does not see this main aspect of the facts, their observation will not be correct.

Second, we should earnestly strengthen education for the industrial and commercial circles, eliminate their doubts and concerns, and correct their erroneous ideas. Redemption is for things, that is, redeeming the means of production of the bourgeoisie; in addition to this, there is also the question of people, that is, the question of educating and transforming capitalists and appropriately arranging their work, etc. The experience of the past six years has proven that educating the industrial and commercial circles has achieved results, but this kind of education work has not been carried out universally and regularly, especially among small and medium-sized industrialists and businessmen. This shortcoming should be corrected, and the work of carrying out political education for the industrial and commercial circles should be conscientiously and universally organized. This kind of education work should be targeted and directed at the specific ideological situation of the industrial and commercial circles. For example, many industrialists and businessmen have a sense of unease because they have not yet recognized the laws of social development and cannot control their own destiny. They should be told that they can control their own destiny. The key here is to combine their own future with the future of society. In the old society, not only the oppressed classes, but also the oppressors could not control their own destiny. The path of the oppressors in the old society was also becoming narrower and narrower. They constantly encroached on, merged with, and harmed each other, and their political and economic speculations often failed. The tragic situation of most industrialists and businessmen in our country before liberation is enough to illustrate that they could not control their own destiny at that time. In today's China, the situation is completely the opposite. The future of society is as clear as the morning sun for everyone, and everyone can find a flat and broad road as long as they advance along the direction of social progress. For peasants, handicraftsmen, and other petty bourgeois elements, this path is to abandon small private ownership and accept the socialist cooperative system. For capitalists, it is to abandon capitalist ownership, abandon the exploitation of workers, and accept socialist state ownership. When capitalists truly abandon exploitation and make a living by labor, their social component is no longer capitalists, but self-reliant laborers. They have no contradictions with workers and peasants. They are lighthearted and free from social reproach. Here, abandoning exploitation does not mean doing so immediately, but rather making ideological preparations now, gradually and appropriately discussing this issue in the learning organizations of capitalists in various cities, having appropriate people answer any questions, and preparing to achieve the nationalization of the means of production after the conditions are ripe through joint state-private ownership and the transformation of industries and trades one by one. At that time, will there be problems with their work? It should be known that socialist society does not and will not have economic crises. As long as they are not lazy and are willing to work sincerely, they will never worry about not finding suitable work to do. Therefore, all patriotic industrialists and businessmen who do not oppose socialist transformation should recognize this future, and not only should they not hesitate and look around, but they should also take the initiative to rush to this future. This is taking control of their own destiny, which will not lead to being at a loss or being like "fifteen buckets drawing water, going up and down." Some industrialists and businessmen feel that they are already old and may not be able to do much work. If this is the case, then, first, their children will take over; second, society and the state will not forget their contributions to the transformation of industry and commerce now. Some people doubt whether there will still be a united front after our country achieves three five-year plans. Of course, after the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie no longer exist, the foundation of the united front has changed, but the alliance of people from different social groups and different historical backgrounds under socialist principles will still be necessary and beneficial. Since the Communists did not abandon non-Party members who had contributed to the democratic revolution after the completion of the democratic revolution, what reason do the Communists have to abandon non-Party members who have contributed to the socialist transformation cause after the completion of the socialist revolution? What reason do they have not to give them appropriate arrangements in work and politics? Some people worry that there are counter-revolutionary elements among the bourgeoisie, and even more people have had connections with counter-revolutionary elements, so they are afraid that they will not be able to gain the understanding of the people. It is true that there are counter-revolutionary elements among the bourgeoisie who resolutely oppose people's democracy and socialism and harm the People's Republic of China with practical actions. Such people must be punished separately according to their specific circumstances, but such people account for only a very small number. Merely having connections with counter-revolutionary elements in history cannot be considered a counter-revolutionary element. As long as such people resolutely sever their relationship with counter-revolutionary elements and do as much work as possible to benefit society and the country, and turn themselves into true patriots, they can still gain the trust of the people based on their patriotic actions. Of course, people should not forget that, as we mentioned earlier, there are currently still many people in the industrial and commercial circles who hold erroneous attitudes towards the country and the people. They are still resisting socialist transformation to varying degrees. They still do not respect the masses of workers and still engage in deceptive behavior towards society and the country. These erroneous attitudes and behaviors cannot, of course, be equated with the behavior of counter-revolutionary elements, but must be resolutely corrected.

Third, we should pay attention to strengthening the work of cultivating progressive core elements in the industrial and commercial circles. Since transforming industry and commerce must be carried out not only through state laws, but also through the work of the united front, it is obvious that the progressive core elements in the industrial and commercial circles have an important role in this. Comrade Mao Zedong once pointed out that model workers have three roles: leading role, backbone role, and bridge role. If the progressive core elements in the industrial and commercial circles sincerely strive in the work of transforming industry and commerce, they should also play these three roles to varying degrees, that is, taking the lead in accepting socialist transformation among industrialists and businessmen, serving as the backbone to assist in transforming industry and commerce, and serving as a bridge between the People's Government and the general industrialists and businessmen. There are already a group of such progressive core elements who have already done some work. However, their number is not large enough, their distribution in various localities and industries is not universal enough, their level of awareness is generally not high enough, and their work needs more supervision, guidance, and improvement. Of course, they should not be required to do too much, but they should not be underestimated. They must be given appropriate work opportunities, problems should be discussed and resolved with them, they should be approached regularly, and they should be helped to overcome their shortcomings so that they can continuously receive more transformation and greater progress in their work and education. The Communist Party organizations and government agencies in various localities, and the public staff in various joint state-private enterprises, must truly attach importance to this issue, earnestly examine and summarize the current situation, so as to systematically and with a long-term plan make plans for cultivating progressive core elements, and implement them with persistent and unremitting efforts. Only in this way can we rely on the concerted efforts of all parties to complete the historical task of carrying out socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce.

Fourth, we should make comprehensive plans for the work of transforming capitalist industry and commerce. With the increase in the degree of planning of the national economy and the rapid progress of the socialist transformation cause in all aspects, transforming private industry and commerce one enterprise at a time can no longer fully meet the needs. The various industries of private industry and commerce across the country must be统筹安排 (tǒng chóu ān pái; comprehensively arranged) by the state. In addition to a portion of very small-scale private industry and commerce (such as individual handicrafts and small merchants) that need to adopt cooperative methods, or continue to adopt processing and ordering and distribution on commission methods, and another portion of commission sales commerce (such as the grain industry) that can be directly transferred to state-owned operations at the appropriate time, the remaining private industry and commerce in all important industries must, on the basis of strengthening processing and ordering work and distribution on commission work, implement overall joint state-private ownership of the entire industry in batches and phases. Only in this way can these private industry and commerce gradually avoid mutual disconnection between supply, production, and sales, between capital, equipment, and labor, between enterprises, between industries, and between regions, so as to achieve balance or near balance. Currently, eight industries in Shanghai's light industry, including cotton spinning, wool spinning, linen spinning, papermaking, cigarette making, enamelware, flour milling, and rice milling, have adopted the method of overall joint state-private ownership of the entire industry, merging 165 households into 103 households; thirteen industries in heavy industry, including shipbuilding, steel rolling, machine forging, milling teeth, power boilers, electrical appliances, machines, auto parts, cement, dyes, stone powder, paint making, and telecommunications, have also been or are in the process of carrying out complete or large-scale joint state-private ownership, which will merge 187 factories into 53 enterprises. In addition to carrying out overall joint state-private ownership of several private industries, Beijing has also implemented overall joint state-private ownership of the cotton cloth industry in commerce. After such joint operation and reorganization of these industries, the difficulties in production and operation have been reduced, efficiency has been improved, the reasonable interests of each household have been properly taken care of, and each household has also been relieved of their worries about their future. In order to implement the transformation of the entire pen, fountain pen, and pencil industry, Shanghai's local industrial organs specially established a pen-making company, absorbing important personnel from private enterprises to participate in the work, which greatly facilitated the joint operation, reorganization, and arrangement of each household. This experience proves that establishing various specialized companies to manage the transformation of the various industries of private industry and commerce is a necessary measure to implement overall arrangements. Under the conditions of joint operation and transformation of the entire industry, the method of distributing profits in which the original capitalists share the enterprise's profits at a certain percentage (the so-called "four horses dividing the fat") is obviously not applicable. The method of fixed interest should be gradually promoted so that the original private shares can appropriately share fixed interest according to the specific situation. Of course, because the development of the original capitalist industry and commerce was anarchic, it was impossible to have plans and impossible to conform to the needs of the entire national economy. Therefore, in the process of overall arrangements, the state will inevitably make reasonable adjustments to the original enterprises in accordance with the interests of the entire society. It should develop more of what should be developed more, develop less of what should be developed less, and stop developing or eliminate what should be stopped developing or eliminated, and appropriate arrangements should be made for the original employees of all enterprises in accordance with specific conditions. Obviously, the comprehensive planning for the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce is a huge and complex task. In this task, not only should attention be paid to economic arrangements, but also attention should be paid to personnel arrangements; not only should preparations for organizational work be strengthened, but also preparations for publicity and education work should be strengthened. All of these issues cannot be fully resolved immediately. However, we should start making plans as soon as possible so that industrialists and businessmen can more clearly see their future, and so that the progress of the entire work does not lag behind the needs of the objective situation.

Transforming capitalist industry and commerce is a component of our country's general task during the transition period. Correctly carrying out this task is of great importance both economically and politically. We have already had six years of experience, which is a good foundation. The conference of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce this time, summarized the past experience, discussed the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, and is of great significance in the process of transforming capitalist industry and commerce. After this conference, we believe that as long as the relevant parties can unify their understanding, the relevant departments of the Central Committee and various localities can earnestly overcome the shortcomings of insufficient attention to this work in the past, strengthen leadership, and make comprehensive plans, this work will definitely be able to achieve more appropriate and more effective development, thereby achieving greater progress in a relatively short period of time.

### 统一认识，全面规划，认真地做好改造资本主义工商业的工作

　　统一认识，全面规划，认真地做好改造资本主义工商业的工作
　　中华全国工商业联合会执行委员会第二次会议已经在昨天闭幕。这次会议在中共中央和毛泽东主席的关怀和指导之下，着重地讨论了进一步开展资本主义工商业的社会主义改造问题。这个讨论是适时的。我国的发展国民经济的第一个五年计划已经实行了将近三年，社会主义工商业每年都有巨大的发展，社会主义经济的优越性和它在国民经济中的优势已经越来越显著了；越来越多的人们看到，我国在大约三个五年计划的时期内，基本上完成生产资料私人所有制的变革而建成社会主义社会，这不但是理有固然，也是势所必至了。我国资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，在过去几年工作的基础上，今年已经开始走上一个新的发展阶段，即许多行业在各地方分别地进行全部公私合营的阶段，而这是我国现阶段国民经济的有计划的发展所迫切需要的。在这一情况下，特别是在全国农业合作化已经进入高潮以后，资本主义工商业者对于社会主义改造中的各项原则问题、办法问题和个人前途问题表示迫切的关心，是完全可以理解的。经过这一次会议的讨论，经过参加这次会议的各个代表回到本地以后的传达，我们相信，全国工商业者的认识可能要提高一大步，而改造资本主义工商业的工作也将进行得更好。
   我国对于资本主义工商业采取和平改造的方针，是从一九四九年立国之初就确定了的。采取这一方针的根据，从政治上说，是由于我国民族资产阶级在反对帝国主义反对封建主义的人民民主革命中，曾经在不同的程度上参加了革命或者采取了中立态度，而在参加这个革命的时候，曾经同工人阶级结成了统一战线；在中华人民共和国成立以后，他们也采取了拥护中华人民共和国而反对帝国主义反对封建主义的立场。从经济上说，是由于我国经济落后，工人阶级领导的人民政权有必要同愿意接受国家资本主义的民族资产阶级建立经济上的联盟，以便于发挥资本主义工商业在一定时期内有益于国计民生的作用，维持工人就业，增加产品供应；而经过国家资本主义的形式，也就便于用和平改造的办法来有秩序地把这些企业纳入社会主义的轨道，避免因突然变革所引起的损失。我国已经建立了工人阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的强大的人民民主政权，建立了强大的和不断壮大的社会主义经济，并且得到以苏联为首的强大的社会主义阵营的巨大援助，而资产阶级对于农民和其他小资产阶级的影响正在越来越小，大势所趋，只有接受社会主义改造是唯一的光明道路。因此，在中华人民共和国宪法上面，就指出了“我国能够通过和平的道路消灭剥削和贫困，建成繁荣幸福的社会主义社会”，并且规定了“国家通过国家行政机关的管理、国营经济的领导和工人群众的监督，利用资本主义工商业的有利于国计民生的积极作用，限制它们的不利于国计民生的消极作用，鼓励和指导它们转变为不同形式的国家资本主义经济，逐步以全民所有制代替资本家所有制”。
   在人民政府的正确领导之下，由于国营经济机关、工商行政机关和私营企业中的工人群众的努力，也由于工商业联合会、民主建国会等组织和工商界爱国人士方面的协同努力，由于对工商界进行了团结教育工作，也由于对工商界进行了必要的严肃的斗争，六年以来，我国资本主义工商业不但对于国家的经济财政作了有益的贡献，而且在接受社会主义改造方面有了很大的进步。首先，大量的私营工商业转成了不同形式的国家资本主义经济。在今年上半年，根据二十二个省的统计，加工订货的产值已经占私营工业总产值的百分之七十八点八；而根据北京、天津、上海等十二个大中城市的统计，加工订货的产值已经占私营工业总产值的百分之八十五点三。公私合营的工业企业在今年上半年已经达到一千九百多户，公私合营工业产值同私营工业产值相较，已经差不多达到三与五之比。在商业方面，凡是国营和合作社营商业已经掌握货源的私营主要行业，基本上已纳入国家资本主义的轨道。其次，工商界的政治状况也已经发生了很大的变化。从一九五二年开展反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗窃国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报的斗争以后，工商界重犯上述行为的情形已经有不同程度的减少和减轻。私营企业中的劳资关系一般地也有所改善，工人的监督已经在许多企业中建立起来。大多数城市中的许多工商业者经常进行政治学习，因而对于社会发展的规律，国内外时事和人民政府的政策法令提高了认识。尤其值得重视的是，在人民政府六年的教育下，在民主建国会、工商业联合会等组织的工作影响下，工商界中已经出现了一批爱国的、进步的分子，他们不但自己愿意接受社会主义改造，而且能够推动其他的工商业者接受改造。他们将形成工商界在接受社会主义改造过程中的核心力量。
   但是在对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造的问题上，是不是就万事大吉了呢？决不是这样。改造资本主义工商业，逐步地用社会主义的全民所有制来代替资本主义所有制，即使是经过和平的道路，仍然是一场深刻的阶级斗争，在这里不可能想像不遇到许多人的抵抗，不可能想像不需要用国家的力量和群众的力量来克服这些人的抵抗。工商界中还有不少违法行为，还有一些压迫工人和收买工人的行为，还有许多抵抗社会主义改造的行为，这些行为都需要反对和制止。所有这些，都应该引起工人阶级、政府工作人员和一切爱国人士的严重注意。对于这一方面的情况，放松注意和丧失警惕，是完全错误的。但是今天的更重要的问题是在：党和人民政府在改造资本主义工商业方面的工作还做得很不够，还落在需要和可能的后面。无论在共产党内，在工人阶级内和在工商界内，关于改造资本主义工商业的宣传教育工作还做得很少，许多思想上的混乱还没有得到澄清。同时，改造资本主义工商业的实际工作也还没有引起各有关部门和全国各地方各城市的普遍重视。对于工商界的有系统的改造，对于全国经济发展所迫切需要的在改造私营工商业问题上进行统筹安排、全面规划的工作，还是仅仅在开始。
   必须适应当前的经济和政治的新形势，加强党和人民政府在这一方面的工作。
   第一，应该切实地统一党内和工人阶级内的认识。改造资本主义工商业必须依靠工人阶级，而为了充分地发动工人阶级的各方面的力量来进行这一艰巨的工作，就必须首先使工人阶级的先锋队和广大的工人群众对于这个问题得到统一的正确的认识。应该看到，党内和工人阶级内至今还有一些人是怀疑逐步地和平地改造资本主义工商业这一方针的；必须向他们好好地讲清楚道理。从原则方面说，马克思主义从来没有排除过资本主义在一定条件下和平地过渡到社会主义的可能性。马克思早就认为，在某种条件下，对于夺得了政权的工人阶级说来，“最便宜不过”的是向资产阶级实行“赎买”，以便实现社会主义的和平胜利。列宁在评论马克思的这一观点的时候说：“对变革的形式、方法和手段，马克思既没有束缚自己的手脚，也没有束缚未来的社会主义革命活动家的手脚，他非常懂得在变革时会有怎样多的新问题发生，在变革进程中整个情况会怎样变化，在变革进程中整个情况会怎样频繁而剧烈地变化。”列宁本人就曾经企图在一九一七年革命胜利以后的俄国通过国家资本主义的过渡形式达到社会主义。但是由于那时俄国的国际国内条件，资产阶级采取了敌视苏维埃政府的态度，所以列宁的计划没有能够在广大的范围内实现。那时的形势，迫使苏维埃政府不得不采取迅速地剥夺资产阶级的生产资料的手段。而在今天的中华人民共和国，由于前面所已经说过的政治上和经济上的具体情况，对于我国工人阶级说来，最适当的正是向资产阶级的生产资料实行“赎买”，并且不是一下子赎买，而是在十几年的时间里逐步赎买。这种赎买的办法，即是工人阶级在这个时期内，在为了满足人民和国家的需要而生产的时候，也从利润中分配一部分给资产阶级，而不是由国家另外用一笔钱向资产阶级的生产资料进行赎买。如大家所知，我国资本主义企业的利润的分配分为四部分：一部分是国家收的所得税，又一部分是工人享受的福利费，第三部分是为了发展企业而设的公积金，这三部分共占企业利润的四分之三以上；第四部分才是分给资本家的不足四分之一的股息红利。资本家所得看来不算很多，但是，就全国统计，一年就有几亿人民币，积十几年之久，就有人民币几十亿之多，用来作为购买民族资产阶级的全部生产资料的代价，是完全足够的了。以上是就原则方面说。再从事实方面来看，我国六年来的历史已经确定不移地证明，采取逐步地和平地改造资本主义工商业的方针，不但是适当的，而且是充分有效的。像我们前面所说的资本主义工商业和工商业者六年来的变化，究竟是很小的成绩呢，还是很大的成绩？究竟是很慢的进展呢，还是很快的进展？没有疑问，应该说这是很大的成绩，很快的进展。可以说，经过国家资本主义的形式，资本主义工商业的原来的面貌已经受到了很大的改变。这种工商业已经不能不服从国家的管理、国营经济的领导和工人阶级的监督。这种工商业现在已经有一只脚被带进了社会主义的门槛，而另一只脚也已经非跟着进来不可。谁要是不看到事实的这个主要方面，他的观察就不会是正确的。
   第二，应该切实地加强对于工商界的教育，消除他们的怀疑顾虑，纠正他们的错误思想。赎买是对物的，即赎买资产阶级的生产资料；除这以外，还有一个对人的问题，即对资本家进行教育改造、适当地安排他们的工作等等的问题。过去六年的经验证明，对于工商界进行教育是收到了成效的，但是这种教育工作还进行得不普遍，不经常，特别在中小工商业者中是这样。应该纠正这种缺点，认真地普遍地把对工商界进行政治教育的工作组织好。这种教育工作应该有的放矢，针对着工商界的具体的思想状况。例如许多工商业者所以有一种不安，是因为他们还没有认清社会发展的规律，还不能掌握自己的命运。应该告诉他们，他们是可以掌握自己的命运的，这里的关键是在把自己的前途同社会的前途结合起来。在旧社会里，不但被压迫阶级，就是压迫阶级也不能掌握自己的命运。旧社会的压迫者的路也是愈走愈窄，他们自己不断地互相倾轧，并吞，陷害，他们的政治的和经济的投机往往要失败。解放以前我国多数工商业者的悲惨境遇，更足以说明，他们在那时候是无法掌握自己的命运的。在今天的中国，情况完全相反。社会的前途对于所有的人都好比早晨的太阳一样明白，而所有的人只要沿着社会前进的方向前进，就都可以找到平坦而且广阔的道路。这种道路，对于农民、手工业者和其他小资产阶级分子说来，就是放弃小私有制，接受社会主义的合作制。对于资本家说来，就是放弃资本主义所有制，放弃对工人的剥削，接受社会主义的国有制。资本家真正放弃了剥削，以劳动为生，他们的社会成份就不再是资本家，而是自食其力的劳动者了，他们同工人、农民就没有矛盾了，他们就一身轻快不受社会责备了。这里说放弃剥削，不是说马上就要这样做，而是说现在要做思想准备，要在各城市的资本家的学习组织中逐步地适当地展开对于这个问题的讨论，如有疑问，要由适当的人加以解答，要准备经过公私合营、逐行逐业的改造，在条件成熟以后，最后达到生产资料的国有化。在那个时候，他们的工作是不是有问题呢？须知社会主义社会是没有也不会有经济危机的，只要不是懒汉，只要是愿意诚恳地工作的人，就永远不愁找不到合适的工作做。因此，一切不反对社会主义改造的爱国的工商业者应该认清这个前途，不但不要徘徊瞻顾，而且要主动地奔赴这个前途，这就是自己掌握了自己的命运，这就不至于皇皇无主，不至于像
   “十五个吊桶打水，七上八下”。一部分工商业者感觉自己年纪已经大了，恐怕做不了什么工作。如果是这样，那末，一则他们的子女将要接上来；二则凡是现在对于工商业的改造有贡献的，社会和国家都不会忘记他们的贡献。有人怀疑，到我国实现了三个五年计划以后还有没有统一战线？当然，在资产阶级和小资产阶级不存在了以后，统一战线的基础是变化了，但是属于不同的社会集团和不同的历史出身的一些人们在社会主义原则下的联合将还是需要的，有益的。共产党人既然没有在民主革命完成以后抛弃对于民主革命有过贡献的党外人士，在社会主义革命完成以后，共产党人又有什么理由抛弃对于社会主义改造事业有贡献的党外人士呢？又有什么理由不在工作上和政治上给他们以适当的安排呢？有人担心，资产阶级里面是有反革命分子的，曾经同反革命分子有过瓜葛的人就更多，因此他们恐怕不能够获得人民的谅解。不错，资产阶级里面是有反革命分子的，他们坚决反对人民民主和社会主义，而且用实际行动来危害中华人民共和国。这种人是必须按照他们的具体情况，有分别地加以惩处的，但是这种人只占极少数。仅仅在历史上同反革命分子有过瓜葛，不能就认为是反革命分子。这样的人只要坚决地断绝他同反革命分子的关系，并且尽可能使自己多做些有益于社会和国家的工作，使自己变为一个真正的爱国主义者，仍然可以根据他的爱国行为得到人民的信任。当然，人们也不应该忘记，像我们在前面所说过的那样，工商界中目前还有许多人是对国家和人民抱着错误态度的，他们对于社会主义改造还进行着不同程度的抵抗，他们对于工人群众还不尊重，对于社会和国家还有欺骗的行为。这些错误的态度和行为，自然不能同反革命分子的行为混为一谈，但是必须加以坚决的纠正。
   第三，应该注意加强培养工商界进步核心分子的工作。既然改造工商业不但要经过国家的法令，而且要经过统一战线的工作来进行，显而易见，工商界中的进步核心分子在这上面就有重要的作用。毛泽东同志曾经指出劳动模范有三种作用：带头作用、骨干作用和桥梁作用。工商界的进步核心分子，如果在改造工商业的工作中真诚努力，也应该在不同的程度上起这三种作用，就是在工商业者中带头接受社会主义改造，作为协助改造工商业的骨干，作为人民政府和一般工商业者之间的桥梁。现在已经有了一批这样的进步核心分子，他们已经做了一部分工作。但是他们的人数还不够多，在各地方各行业中间的分布还不普遍，他们的觉悟程度一般地说来也还不够高，他们的工作还需要更多的督促、指导和改善。对于他们当然不应该要求过高，但是也不应该估计过低。必须让他们得到适当的工作的机会，有问题同他们商量解决，并且经常同他们接近，帮助他们克服缺点，使他们不断地在工作中和教育中得到更多的改造，得到更大的进步。各地方的共产党组织和政府机构、各公私合营企业的公方工作人员，必须对于这个问题真正给以重视，把现有的状况认真地加以检查和总结，以便有系统地、有长远打算地作出培养进步核心分子的计划，并且用持久不懈的努力加以实现。只有这样，才能依靠各方面的通力协作，完成对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造的历史任务。
   第四，应该对改造资本主义工商业的工作作出全面的规划。随着国民经济的计划化程度的增加，随着社会主义改造事业在各方面的迅速进展，对私营工商业一个企业一个企业地进行改造已经不能够完全适应需要了。全国私营工商业的各个行业，必须由国家统筹安排。除了一部分规模很小的私营工商业（例如个体手工业和小商贩）需要采取合作化的办法，或者继续采取加工订货、经销代销办法，而另一部分代销商业（例如粮食业）可以在适当时机直接转为国营以外，其余一切重要行业的私营工商业，都必须在加强加工订货工作和经销代销工作的基础上，分批分期地实行全行业的公私合营。只有这样，才能逐步地使这些私营工商业在供应、生产、销售之间，资金、设备、劳力之间，企业之间，行业之间，地区之间，避免相互脱节，达到平衡或者接近平衡。目前上海市轻工业的棉纺、毛纺、麻纺、造纸、卷烟、搪瓷、面粉、碾米等八个行业，已经采取了全行业公私合营的办法，把一百六十五户合并为一百零三户；重工业的船舶、轧钢、机锻、铣牙、动力锅炉、电器、机器、汽车配件、水泥、染料、石粉、造漆、电讯等十三个行业，也已经或者正在进行全部或者大部的公私合营，将由一百八十七个厂合并为五十三个企业。北京市除了对若干私营工业进行了全行业的公私合营以外，在商业方面，也已经对棉布业实行了全行业的公私合营。这些行业在这样的合营和改组以后，生产和经营中的困难减少了，效率提高了，每一户的合理利益都得到了适当的照顾，每一户对于自己的前途也都放了心。为了实行金笔、钢笔、铅笔业的全行业改造，上海的地方工业机关专门成立了一个制笔公司，吸收私营企业的重要人员参加工作，大大便利了合营、改组、逐户安排的工作的进行。这一经验证明，成立各种专业公司来主管对于私营工商业的各行业的改造，是实行统筹安排的一种必要的措施。在全行业合营和改造的条件下，关于利润的分配，原来的资本家按一定成数分得企业利润（即所谓“四马分肥”）的办法，显然是不适用了，应该逐步地推行定息的办法，使原有的私股按照具体情况适当地分得固定的利息。当然，由于原有的资本主义工商业的发展是无政府的，不可能有计划，不可能符合于整个国民经济的需要，因此，国家在统筹安排的过程中，必然要按照全社会的利益对原有企业加以合理的调整，应该多发展的多发展，应该少发展的少发展，应该停止发展或者淘汰的停止发展或者淘汰，而对于所有企业的原有从业人员，都应该按照具体条件，给以适当的安置。很明显，改造资本主义工商业的全面规划是一个巨大的复杂的任务。在这一任务中，不仅需要注意经济上的安排，而且需要注意人事上的安排；不仅需要加强组织工作上的准备，而且需要加强宣传教育工作上的准备。所有这些问题都不是可以马上全部解决的。但是应该尽快地着手陆续作出规划，以便使工商业者更加明显地看到自己的前途，并且使整个工作的进展不落在客观形势的需要之后。
   改造资本主义工商业是我国过渡时期总任务的一个组成部分。正确地执行这个任务，无论在经济上和政治上都有极大的重要性。我们已经有了六年的经验，这是一个良好的基础。这次全国工商业联合会的会议，总结了过去的经验，讨论了中共中央和毛泽东主席的指示，在资本主义工商业的改造工作的过程中是有重大意义的。在这一次会议以后，我们相信，只要有关的各方面能够统一认识，中央各有关部门和各地方都能够认真地克服过去对这一工作重视不够的缺点，加强领导，并且作出全面规划，这一工作就一定能够得到更妥善和更有效的发展，从而在比较短的时间内得到比较大的进步。
