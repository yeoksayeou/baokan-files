　　Organize Comprehensive Work Teams to Improve Coal Mining Efficiency
　　By our staff reporter Jin Yukun
　　As soon as Cui Chengfu arrived at the Dongshan Shaft of the Hegang No. 1 Mine, he resolved to organize a comprehensive work team.

　　He learned about this advanced labor organization from Terassimov, the coal mining team leader of the Fifth Coal Mining Section at the Kirov Mine in the Soviet Union, a man famous for completing forty-two cycles in a month.

　　At the Kirov Mine, Comrade Terassimov had led him to his own coal face operated by a combined coal mining machine. There, Cui Chengfu first noticed that there were few people, but the work was very intense and coordinated. As the combined coal mining machine moved forward, the people behind it followed closely, quickly erecting new supports. After careful observation, Cui Chengfu discovered that their methods were different from those used in Chinese coal mines. In Chinese coal mines, coal loaders only loaded coal, support workers only erected props, and drilling workers only used electric drills. Here, everyone did everything, flexibly dividing the work according to the needs of the job. Haulers and coal sweepers could do the work of support workers, and support workers also frequently changed their work. As soon as the combined coal mining machine stopped, the combined coal mining machine operators immediately did other work instead of sitting idly by. Therefore, every minute of every person was fully utilized.

　　Through Comrade Terassimov's introduction, Cui Chengfu learned that this labor organization was called a "comprehensive work team." It was not a specialized division of labor, but rather a combined operation, meaning that one worker had to be proficient in several skills. Comrade Terassimov said that the comprehensive work team was an advanced labor organization in Soviet coal mines. It could eliminate the phenomenon of wasted work caused by specialized division of labor. At the same time, because preparatory work could be carried out simultaneously, it created conditions for uninterrupted production, thus greatly increasing labor productivity.

　　Cui Chengfu understood that the reason why coal mining efficiency in the coal mine where he used to work was not easy to improve was mainly due to the backwardness of the labor organization. There, some people were often sweating profusely while others squatted aside idly. This was not because some people were lazy, but because it was impossible to simultaneously drill, load coal, blast, and support at a single coal face. Since work could not be carried out simultaneously, some people were bound to waste time. Even if the idle people wanted to help the busy people, it was impossible. First, he was not familiar with the skills of other jobs; second, all the work was already the responsibility of specific people, making it difficult to intervene. Working and stopping, stopping and working, the actual working time for each person per shift was only two or three hours.

　　In order to organize a comprehensive work team, as soon as Cui Chengfu arrived at the New No. 1 Mine, he moved into the single dormitory to live with the young workers of his team, promoted the benefits of comprehensive work teams to them, and studied with everyone how to use this advanced labor organization based on the characteristics of the coal face. Finally, on the steeply inclined coal face of the Second Coal Mining Section, the first comprehensive work team in the coal mining industry, led by Cui Chengfu, appeared.

　　On the steeply inclined coal face where the comprehensive work team worked, it was very difficult to even go up and down empty-handed, and the hardship of the comprehensive work team working here year after year can be imagined. When we went to visit, we saw rows of dense supports. There were five people working on the coal face. Two of them were carrying wooden poles weighing more than 150 kilograms through the dense supports along the inclined coal seam to the work site. The other two were busily erecting props, and the other was using an electric drill to drill holes. The work was carried out very flexibly. When the transportation work was completed, the two people came over to erect props together. Before long, all the work was completed. With a "boom," the coal seam was blasted into small pieces, and the workers quickly returned to the coal face to work. Except for one person left to carry out preparatory work, the support workers, haulers, and drilling workers all came to load coal. Four people lined up and swung their shovels together, loading the coal into the conveyor, which transported the shiny coal pieces into the mine car. After the coal was loaded, the work started again, proceeding repeatedly in the order of transport, propping, drilling, and blasting. No matter what kind of operation, it was not unfamiliar to anyone.

　　Cui Chengfu told us that in this coal face, before the comprehensive work team was organized, the entire team had 25 people, including ten auxiliary workers. In the past, this was not considered too many. However, everyone squeezed each other on the narrow working surface, which was both inconvenient and unsafe. After organizing the comprehensive work team, the entire team was reduced from 25 people to 11, and the number of workers on the coal face was reduced from 15 to 5. Although there were fewer people than before, the work was done better than before. The geological conditions here are very poor, but they often overfulfilled the national plan, and their performance has always been outstanding in the work section. In the past, in a steeply inclined coal face with the same natural conditions and the same scale, the average output per person per shift was only a little over two tons. Now, calculated by the average output of the ten days in mid-September, the output per person per shift is 5.2 tons. With the increase in labor productivity, the actual income of workers has also increased. Wang Mingluan, a grade six worker, originally earned about 300 work points per month, but now he can get 480 points, an increase of about 50%. The income situation of other workers is similar.

　　When promoting comprehensive work teams, the main difficulty they encountered was that they were not skilled enough at the beginning. Drilling workers did not know how to prop, and support workers did not know how to drill. Their solution to this problem was to organize mutual learning among various types of workers. Before long, everyone became an "all-around" worker who could drill, support, and load coal, and they did it very skillfully.

　　组织综合工作队，提高采煤效率
　　本报记者　金雨困
    崔成福一到鹤岗新一矿——东山竖井，就下决心组织综合工作队。
    这个先进的劳动组织，是他在苏联基洛夫矿井跟第五采煤段的采煤班长捷拉西莫夫，一位以一个月完成四十二个循环而著名的人物学来的。
    在基洛夫矿井，捷拉西莫夫同志曾领他到自己的联合采煤机掌子面上去。在那里，崔成福首先看到的是人不多，工作却非常紧张、合拍，联合采煤机一往前移动，后边的人就紧紧地随着前进，把新的支架迅速地架设起来。经过仔细的观察，崔成福发现：他们所采用的方法跟中国煤矿所采用的不一样：在中国煤矿里，装煤工只装煤，支柱工只搭棚子，打眼工只使电钻；在这里，每个人什么都干，根据工作的需要灵活地分工。运搬工和扫煤工可以去做支柱工的工作，支柱工也经常改变自己的工作。联合采煤机一停止，联合采煤机手也马上做其它的工作，而不是闲坐一旁。因此每一个人的每一分钟都充分利用了。
    经过捷拉西莫夫同志的介绍，崔成福才知道这种劳动组织叫做“综合工作队”。它不是专业分工，而是兼工种作业，即一个工人得干好几手的活。捷拉西莫夫同志说，综合工作队是苏联煤矿的一种先进的劳动组织，它能消除专业分工所形成的窝工现象，同时由于准备工作可以同时进行，就为不间断生产创造了条件，因而能大大提高劳动生产率。
    崔成福明白了过去他所在的煤矿的采煤效率所以不易提高，主要是由于劳动组织的落后。在那里，往往是一些人忙得满头大汗，而另一些人则蹲在一旁闲着。这并不是有一些人偷懒，而是因为在一个掌子面上不可能同时又打眼、又装煤、又放炮、又支架。既然不能同时进行工作，就必然有一部分人窝工。闲着的人即使想帮助忙着的人，也是不可能的。因为第一、他不熟悉其它工种的手艺；第二、所有的工作都已有专人负责，难于插手。这样干干停停，停停干干，每人每班的实际工作时间不过二三小时。
    为了组织综合工作队，崔成福一到新一矿，就搬到独身宿舍去跟本班青年工人一起住，向他们宣传综合工作队的好处，并和大家研究如何根据掌子面的特点来采用这种先进的劳动组织。终于，在第二采煤段的急倾斜掌子面上，出现了崔成福领导的煤矿工业中第一个综合工作队。
    在综合工作队工作的急倾斜的掌子面上，连空身上下也感到非常困难，而综合工作队成年累月在这里工作，其艰苦是可以想像的。我们去参观时，只见一排一排密密的支柱，掌子面上共有五个人在工作，其中两个人正在把一百五十多斤的木杆，通过密密的支柱沿着倾斜的煤层送到工作地点去，另外两个人正在紧张地架棚子，另一个人在用电钻得得地打眼。工作进行得非常灵活。搬运工作结束了，两个人就过来一起架棚子。不一会全部工作完成了，“轰”的一声，煤层被炸成碎块，工人们又迅速回到掌子面上工作。除了留下一个人去进行准备工作外，支柱工、运搬工、打眼工都来装煤，四个人排成一列，一起挥动着铁铲，卡察卡察地把煤块装进运输机，运输机就把这些乌亮的煤块送到矿车里。煤装完后，工作又重新开始，按照运搬、架棚子、打眼、放炮的顺序，往复不已地进行。无论那一种操作，对每个人来说都不是陌生的。
    崔成福告诉我们，在这个掌子面里，在没有组织综合工作队以前，全班共有二十五个人，其中辅助工十人。以过去的情况来说，这还不算太多。但是在狭长的工作面上大家互相挤着，既不方便，又不安全。组织综合工作队后，全班由二十五人减到十一人，掌子面上的工人由十五人减少到五人。人虽然比过去少了，工作却比过去做得更好。这里的地质条件很不好，他们却经常超额完成国家计划，在工作段里，成绩始终是出色的。在过去，同样自然条件、同样规模的一个急倾斜掌子面，平均每个人每班的产量仅二吨多一点，现在以九月中旬十天的平均产量计算，每人每班的产量是五点二吨。随着劳动生产率的提高，工人的实际收入也增加了。六级工王鸣鸾本来每月收入约三百个工薪分，现在可以拿到四百八十分，增加了百分之五十左右。其他工人的收入情况也是相似的。
    在推行综合工作队的时候，他们遇到的主要困难是在开始的时候技术不够熟练，打眼工不懂得如何支架，支柱工又不会打眼。他们解决这个问题的办法就是组织各工种互相学习。没有很久的时间，每个人就成为既能打眼，也能支架和装煤的“全能”工人，而且干得非常熟练了。
