Do a Good Job of Putting Autumn Grain into Storage

The state collects and purchases more than 80 billion jin of grain every year. Properly storing and handling this grain is a very heavy task. Now, the autumn grain tax and unified purchase grain are about to be put into storage in large quantities. All localities must accept the experiences and lessons of the past few years and quickly do all the specific work during the grain storage period to avoid losses.

What problems must be paid attention to and what shortcomings must be overcome during the grain storage period?

The grain put into storage must be guaranteed to be dry and clean. This is the primary issue that should be paid attention to in grain work. A survey of the quality of autumn grain put into storage in 1954 in fourteen provinces, including Hebei, found that the average moisture content exceeding the safe storage standard accounted for 23.3 percent of the total amount of grain put into storage. In 1954, the moisture content of grain put into storage in Heilongjiang Province was generally higher than in 1953. Soon after the grain was put into storage, grain fever occurred in more than ten warehouses in Hailin, Shangzhi and other counties, and a lot of grain rotted. According to inspections in December 1954 in nine provinces and cities including Beijing, Tianjin, and Henan, nearly 40 percent of the new grain put into storage was infested with insects.

In order to eliminate these phenomena and improve the quality of grain put into storage, it is necessary to conduct in-depth publicity and education work among the broad masses of peasants. It is imperative to explain to them clearly: the grain collected and purchased by the state is the most important material to ensure socialist economic construction and supply the needs of the people. If the quality of the grain put into storage is too low, resulting in mold, rot, and deterioration, this will not only be a loss to the state, but also a loss to the peasants. The state's grain collection and purchase are seasonal. If the grain put into storage is not dry and clean, it must be frequently turned and sorted. If one to two hundred billion jin of high-moisture and insect-infested grain are turned and sorted, it will cost one to two hundred million labor days; and each sorting will waste several hundred million jin of grain and cost tens of millions of yuan. From this, it can be seen how important it is to ensure the quality of the new grain put into storage.

When purchasing grain from peasants, it is necessary to implement the price policy of "pricing according to quality, with higher prices for better quality" to reward peasants for selling good grain. This is an effective way to ensure grain quality. It is important to make it clear to the broad masses of peasants: it is relatively simple for each household to sort out the dozens or hundreds of jin of grain that they should pay or sell, and they can get a higher price for it.

During the autumn grain purchase period, the grain departments in all localities must correctly inspect the quality grade of grain. It is necessary to prevent the tendency of demanding too high and using coercion and commandism; it is also necessary to prevent the tendency of ignoring the quality of grain. Grain departments should stipulate grain quality standards, formulate standard samples; adopt the method of inspecting in villages, organize the masses to compare with each other, accept grain according to samples, and price according to quality, so as to ensure that bad grain does not leave the village.

Strengthening the planning of new grain receiving work and ensuring the rational distribution of grain can improve grain operation and management and reduce commodity circulation costs. Grain storage is the starting point for peasants to pay and sell grain to the state, and it is the beginning of a basic circulation process from the place of production to the place of sale, and from the countryside to the city. All localities should, according to their local conditions, try to adapt to the local supply needs, and arrange grain collection points and rationally distribute grain depots in a planned manner, with the principle of facilitating transportation, in order to reduce the number of turnovers and save costs. In the past, many grain workers did not fully understand the importance of strengthening the planning of new grain storage work, and carried out new grain receiving work in isolation, regardless of the needs of supply and transportation. Therefore, some areas transported the grain that should have been supplied to the countryside to the towns, and then transported it back from the towns; some areas concentrated the grain in the opposite direction of the correct flow; some areas had a large supply volume, but received very little grain; some areas had a small supply volume, but received a lot of grain; some areas had processing plants, but did not receive grain near the plants, but set up purchasing points near the processing plants, and then transported it to the factories for processing; and some areas did not consider the inventory of each grain collection point and emptied the supply grain, and then replenished grain from other places. The result of such roundabout transportation, opposite transportation and backhaul transportation increased the number of turnovers of commercial grain and wasted a lot of freight. In 1954, some counties had an average transportation volume of two jin for every jin of grain sold within the county, and the grain transportation volume of some provinces and special districts was four times the sales volume, while the transportation cost at the grassroots level accounted for 51 percent of the total freight. This is a serious waste. This unreasonable situation in grain management must be changed, which requires strengthening the planning and organization of new grain storage work.

In order to strengthen the planning of new grain storage work, the staff of the grain department must overcome conservative thinking and the idea of neglecting economic accounting, and make full use of the results of grain "three fixings" to comprehensively plan grain business work. Before the new grain is put into storage, the grain organs of each county can make appropriate new grain storage plans based on the local grain production, sales, surplus, and shortage, and uniformly arrange grain collection points. When determining the grain collection points, it is necessary to consider where the surplus grain will be collected from, where the shortage grain may be replenished from, and where it is more reasonable to keep the local supply grain; in areas with processing plants, grain should be received near the plants according to the processing capacity and storage capacity. Some peasants in some areas have begun to sell grain to the state in advance for production and living needs. This also requires strengthening organizational leadership and handover management work according to the principle of unified arrangement, and incorporating the grain sold by peasants before the state officially organizes the storage work into the overall storage plan. Only on the basis of strengthening planning can the grain be distributed well, and it is possible to avoid the phenomenon of roundabout transportation, opposite transportation, and backhaul transportation of grain, and save a lot of freight.

The work of sending grain to storage is very arduous, and meticulous and thoughtful organizational work must be carried out to ensure the safety of the masses and livestock sending grain. In 1954, many provinces and regions had accidents involving casualties of people and livestock during the grain delivery process. Why did these accidents happen? Certain objective reasons exist, such as severe weather, rugged and difficult roads, and the carelessness of the masses sending grain. However, the more important reason is that the staff of certain Party committees, governments and grain organs do not care enough about the lives and property of the masses sending grain, do not fully understand the arduousness of the grain delivery work, and treat the grain delivery work with a bureaucratic attitude, which inevitably leads to accidents. We must take responsibility for the lives and property of the masses, strengthen the specific leadership and supervision and inspection of the grain delivery work, improve the sense of responsibility of grassroots cadres, and take thorough measures to ensure the safety of peasants and livestock.

According to the experience of various localities, it is best to take villages or agricultural production cooperatives as units, adopt the method of collective grain delivery, and let village cadres and cooperative directors be responsible for leading the masses to safely deliver grain to storage. Roads and bridges must be inspected and repaired, and wharfs and ferries must be supervised. It is strictly forbidden for the old, weak, sick, young people and livestock to participate in grain delivery. At the same time, safety education for the masses sending grain should also be strengthened. Grain depots should sign "fixed time, fixed quantity, fixed point" storage contracts with villages, strengthen on-site management, pay attention to safe grain filling, and do a good job in medical care and tea and water reception for the masses to prevent casualties of people and livestock.

### 做好秋粮入库工作

    做好秋粮入库工作
    国家每年征收和收购八百多亿斤粮食，把这批粮食保管和处理妥当，是一项很繁重的任务。现在秋征公粮和统购粮食即将大量入库。各地必须接受几年来的经验教训，迅速把粮食入库期间的各种具体工作全都做好，以免损失。
    在粮食入库期间，必须注意解决哪些问题，克服哪些缺点呢？
    入库粮食必须保证干燥和洁净，这是粮食工作中应该注意的首要问题。河北等十四个省曾经普查一九五四年秋季入库粮食的质量，发现水分超过安全保管标准的，平均占入库粮食总量百分之二十三点三。一九五四年黑龙江省入库的粮食的水分，一般都超过一九五三年；粮食入库不久，海林、尚志等县十多处仓库就发生粮食发热的现象，霉烂了许多粮食。据北京、天津、河南等九个省市一九五四年十二月检查，入库的新粮，生虫的几达百分之四十。
    为了消除这些现象，提高入库粮食的质量，必须向广大农民进行深入的宣传教育工作。一定要向他们说明白：国家征收和统购的粮食是保证社会主义经济建设，供应人民需要的最重要的物资。如果入库粮食质量太低，因而发生了霉烂、变质的现象，这就不仅是国家的损失，也是农民的损失。国家征、购粮食是有季节性的。如果入库的粮食不干燥、不洁净，那就必须经常进行翻晒整理。要是翻晒整理一、二百亿斤高水分的和生虫的粮食，就要耗费一、二千万个劳动日；而且经过一次整理就要损耗几亿斤粮食，开支成千万元的费用。由此可见，保证入库新粮的质量是多么重要的问题。
    向农民统购粮食，必须实行“依质论价、优质优价”的价格政策，奖励农民出售好粮。这是保证粮食质量的有效办法。要向广大农民说清楚：一家一户把自己应缴纳或出售的几十斤、几百斤粮食整理好，是比较简单的事情，而且可以得到较高的价格。
    在秋粮统购期间，各地粮食部门必须正确地检验粮食质量等级。既要防止要求过高、强迫命令的偏向；也要防止对粮食质量放任不管的偏向。粮食部门应该规定粮食的质量标准，制定标准样品；采取就村检验的办法，组织群众互相评比，对样验收，依质作价，做到坏粮不出村。
    加强新粮接收工作的计划性，保证粮食的合理摆布，可以改善粮食经营管理、降低商品流转费用。粮食入库是农民向国家缴、售粮食的起点，是从产地到销地、从农村到城市的一个基本流转过程的开端。各地应该根据当地的情况，尽量适应当地的供应需要，并且以便利调运为原则，有计划地安排收粮点，合理地摆布粮库，以达到减少周转层次、节约费用的目的。过去许多粮食工作人员对于加强新粮入库工作的计划性的重要意义认识不足，不顾供应、调运的需要，孤立地进行新粮接收工作。因此，有的地区把应向农村供应的粮食运到城镇，又从城镇倒运回来；有的地区把粮食向正确流向相反的方向集中；有的地区供应量较大，但接收的粮食却很少；有的地区供应量较小，但接收的粮食却很多；有的地区设有加工厂，但不就厂收粮，却在加工厂的附近设收购点，然后运到工厂加工；还有的地区不考虑每个收粮点的库存量，把供应粮调空，结果又从其他地方补调粮食。这样迂回运输、相向运输和倒运的结果，增加了商品粮食的周转层次，浪费了大量的运费。一九五四年有些县在县境以内平均销售一斤粮食，要有二斤的运量，有些省、专区的粮食运输量等于销售量的四倍，而基层运输费用竟占全部运费的百分之五十一。这是一个严重的浪费。必须改变粮食经营中的这种不合理的状况，这就要加强新粮入库工作的计划性和组织性。
    要想加强新粮入库工作的计划性，粮食部门的工作人员就要克服保守思想和忽视经济核算的思想，要充分运用粮食“三定”的成果，全面规划粮食业务工作。各县粮食机关在新粮入库以前，可以根据本地区粮食产、销、余、缺的情况，做出适当的新粮入库计划，统一安排收粮点。确定收粮点的时候，要考虑余粮向何处调集，缺粮可能由何处调补，当地的供应粮留在哪里较为合理；有加工厂的地区，要根据加工能力和储存能力就厂接收。有些地区的农民为了生产和生活需要，开始提前向国家出售粮食。这同样要根据统一安排的原则，加强组织领导和交接管理工作，把农民在国家正式组织入库工作以前出售的粮食，也纳入总的入库计划中。只有在加强计划性的基础上，把粮食摆布好，才有可能避免粮食的迂回运输、相向运输和倒运的现象，大量节约运费。
    送粮入库的工作十分艰巨，必须进行细致、周到的组织工作，保证送粮的群众和牲畜的安全。一九五四年送粮过程中，有许多省、区曾发生人、畜伤亡事故。为什么会发生这种事故呢？某些客观原因是存在的，例如天气严寒、道路崎岖难行、送粮群众疏忽大意等等。但是，更重要的原因，则是某些党委、政府和粮食机关的工作人员，对送粮群众的生命财产关心不够，对送粮工作的艰巨性认识不足，用官僚主义态度对待送粮工作，这就难免发生事故。我们必须对群众的生命财产负起责任，必须加强送粮工作的具体领导和督促检查，提高基层干部的责任心，采取周密的措施，保证农民和牲畜的安全。
    根据各地的经验，最好以乡村或农业生产合作社为单位，采取集体送粮的办法，由乡村干部、社长负责领导群众安全送粮入库。道路、桥梁必须检查和修理，码头、渡口必须有人监管。严格禁止老、弱、病、幼的人和牲畜参加送粮。同时，还要加强对送粮群众进行安全教育。粮库应该同乡村订定“定时、定量、定点”的入库合同，加强现场管理，注意安全灌仓，做好群众医疗、茶水招待工作，防止人、畜伤亡事故的发生。
