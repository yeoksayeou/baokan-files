Helping Newly Established Agricultural Cooperatives with Production
	Ziyang

	With the high tide of the agricultural production collectivization movement, a large number of new agricultural production cooperatives have been established across the country. How to ensure that these new cooperatives embark on a healthy development path from the beginning, especially how to enable these new cooperatives to immediately engage in production in a led and organized manner, is a problem that party branches in the townships should pay attention to.
	The Party branch of Naliang Township in Lianjiang County, Guangdong Province, attached importance to this issue and provided effective leadership.
	When the seven new cooperatives in this township had just been established, it was already the season for autumn harvest and winter planting. The objective situation required these cooperatives to immediately shift to production. However, some cooperative cadres had complacent and relaxed attitudes, believing that "the masses have high enthusiasm for production, and production does not need leadership." Pang Naicai, a member of the township's party branch committee, said: "The masses in our township have the habit of early harvesting and early planting, so do we still need to lead them?" Pang Chunzhi, the director of the newly established cooperative, said: "The masses will automatically engage in production. We are already dizzy from evaluating the means of production. Let's take a rest!"
	Was it really the case that production did not need leadership? The township's party branch held a meeting to discuss this issue. Based on the situation presented, such a conclusion could not be drawn. After the establishment of the cooperatives, the enthusiasm of the cooperative members was indeed high, but due to the inadequate organization of production, the new cooperatives often experienced a waste of labor. For example, in the cooperative led by Pang Bingtao, forty-five people were crowded in three mu of land working; in the cooperative led by Pang Junxing, twenty-two people were working together in eight fen of land. When recording work points in the evening, many people only earned "six li" work points for a day's work. After the work was recorded, the cooperative members surrounded the cooperative director, asking him to assign them work for the next day. The chaotic situation in production caused doubts among some cooperative members and distress among the cooperative cadres. The work recorders lacked experience in calculating work points, and their low efficiency also made the masses dissatisfied.
	The Party branch meeting forcefully criticized the complacent and relaxed attitudes of those who only saw the achievements of establishing cooperatives and the enthusiasm of the masses for production, but did not see the problems and difficulties. Subsequently, the Party branch also convened a joint meeting of cooperative directors, pointing out the current problems in production. It called on everyone to fully lead production. In order to overcome the various concerns of the cooperative members and stabilize their emotions, the Party branch also helped the newly established cooperatives convene a members' meeting, explaining to everyone that the current chaotic situation in production was due to the fact that the cooperatives had just been established, and many specific problems had not yet been resolved. However, these were difficulties in the course of progress, and they could be gradually overcome by using collective wisdom.
	At the same time, the Party branch separately convened meetings of the joint cooperative committee, production team leaders, and work recorders, helping the cadres of the newly established cooperatives learn methods for organizing production. Based on the experience of old cooperatives in establishing production teams and implementing contract work systems, the new cooperative cadres organized temporary production teams, implementing temporary contract work by production teams for autumn harvest and winter planting. The new cooperative production team leaders learned the experience of being a production team leader from the old cooperative production team leaders. The new cooperative work recorders not only learned the method of recording work through meetings, but also developed a method of recording work suitable for the current needs of the newly established cooperatives, evaluating the base work for the autumn harvest land and uniformly allocating labor for the autumn harvest. The cooperative members' work points for the autumn harvest and winter planting were recorded in the work account. When settling the account, the work points earned by the cooperative members were deducted from the autumn harvest work points payable by the household to determine the work points earned. In this way, it was possible to achieve collective labor for the autumn harvest and "whoever plants harvests" the autumn harvest crops.
	After such arrangements, the chaotic situation in production was overcome, and the waste of labor was greatly reduced. Due to the reasonable handling of work points and the increased efficiency of work recording, the emotions of the cooperative members were more stable, and production could proceed smoothly.
	The Party branch also criticized the conservative thinking of some cadres in formulating winter planting plans. For example, the winter planting plan of the new cooperative led by Pang Bingjian was relatively conservative, planning only one hundred mu of winter plowing area, with fifteen dan of fertilizer applied per mu. After this plan was submitted to the cooperative members for discussion, the cooperative members requested that the winter plowing area be increased to one hundred and twenty mu, and the fertilizer application be increased to twenty dan per mu. Therefore, the Party branch sharply asked: "Are we leading production by standing in front of the masses, or are we following behind the masses?" In the discussion at the Party branch meeting, the error of conservative thinking was forcefully refuted, and the backward and conservative winter plowing plan was revised. The winter plowing area of the seven new cooperatives was expanded by more than four hundred mu in total. The fertilizer accumulation work of all nine townships (including two old cooperatives) also rapidly developed. Within three days, the nine townships accumulated a total of more than 20,700 dan of fertilizer. The cumulative fertilizer accumulation of the entire township has reached more than 76,900 dan, with an average of 30 dan of fertilizer applied per mu. The planned yield per mu of winter planting sweet potatoes is also around 1,000 jin to 1,200 jin, which is higher than before. Some new cooperative cadres have also come up with methods such as "harvesting one field of ripe rice, plowing one field, and harrowing one field" and using wooden hammers to break up soil clods, avoiding the crowding of work and saving cattle power, and solving the difficulty of insufficient cattle. Currently, the production upsurge in the township is rising day by day.

    帮助新建的农业合作社进行生产
    子扬
    随着农业生产合作化运动高潮的到来，各地建立起大批新的农业生产合作社。如何使这许多新社一开始就走上健康发展的道路，特别是如何使这许多新社马上有领导有组织地投入生产，这是党的乡支部应该注意的一个问题。
    广东省廉江县那良乡党支部重视了这个问题，并作了有效的领导。
    当这个乡七个新社刚刚建成的时候，已值秋收、冬种季节，客观情况要求这些社马上转上生产。但是有些社干部有自满松劲情绪，认为“群众生产热情很高，生产用不着领导”。乡的党支部委员庞乃才就这样说：“我们乡的群众有早收早种的习惯，还用我们领导吗？”新建社主任庞春治说：“群众会自动进行生产的，我们搞生产资料评议工作已经弄得头昏脑胀，还是休息休息罢！”
    是不是生产不用领导了呢？乡的党支部召开会议讨论了这个问题。根据摆出来的情况，并不能作出这样的结论。建社以后，社员的生产热情的确很高涨，可是由于生产的组织工作不够好，新建社就常常出现浪费劳动力的现象。如庞炳桃领导的社，四十五个人挤在三亩田里工作；庞均兴领导的社，八分地里就有二十二个人一起做活。晚上记工评分，许多人干了一天只得“六厘”工分。记了工，社员又围上社主任，要求给他们派出明天的工作。生产上的混乱现象，引起了部分社员的疑虑和社干部的苦恼。记工员算工记工缺乏经验，工作效率低，也使群众不大满意。
    党支部会议有力地批判了那些只看到建社成绩和群众生产热情，而看不到问题和困难的自满松劲情绪。随后，党支部又召开了社主任联席会议，指出了目前生产中的问题。号召大家全力领导生产。为了克服社员的各种顾虑，安定社员的情绪，党支部还帮助新建社召开社员大会，向大家说明当前生产上的混乱现象，是由于社刚建成，许多具体问题还没有得到解决。但是，这是前进中的困难，是可以运用集体智慧来逐步克服的。
    同时，党支部分别召开了联社委员会、生产队长、记工员等会议，帮助新建社干部学习组织生产的办法。新社干部根据老社建立生产队，实行包工制等经验，组织了临时性的生产队，实行秋收、冬种工作由生产队临时包工。新社生产队长向老社生产队长学习了当生产队长的经验。新社记工员不但通过会议学会了记工方法，并且研究出一种适应当前新建社需要的记工方法，将秋收土地评出底工，由社统一调配劳动力进行秋收。社员的秋收、冬种工分都记入工账，结账的时候，在社员所得的工分里除去本户应付的秋收工分便是所得的工分。这样，就可以做到秋收集体劳动和秋收作物“谁种谁收”。
    经过这样的安排，生产上的混乱现象克服了，浪费劳动力的现象大大减少了。由于工分处理办法合理，记工效率提高，社员情绪更加安定，生产就能够顺利进行。
    党支部还批判了部分干部在制定冬种计划中的保守思想。如庞炳鉴所领导的新社的冬种计划就比较保守，只计划冬耕面积一百亩，每亩施肥十五担。这个计划交给社员讨论以后，社员要求把冬耕面积增加到一百二十亩，每亩施肥增加到二十担。因此，党支部尖锐地提出：“我们领导生产，是站在群众前面，还是跟在群众的后面呢？”在党支部会议的讨论中，有力地批驳了保守思想的错误，修正了落后保守的冬耕计划。七个新建社的冬耕面积共扩大了四百多亩。全乡九个社（包括两个老社）的积肥工作也迅速地开展起来。三天之内，九个社共积肥两万零七百多担。全乡累计积肥已达七万六千九百多担，平均每亩地可下肥三十担。冬种甘薯的每亩计划产量也都在一千斤到一千二百斤左右，比以前提高了。有些新社干部还想出了“稻谷熟一丘，割一丘，犁耙一丘”和用木锤打碎土块的办法，避免工作挤在一起和节省牛力，解决了耕牛不足的困难。目前该乡的生产热潮正在日益高涨中。
