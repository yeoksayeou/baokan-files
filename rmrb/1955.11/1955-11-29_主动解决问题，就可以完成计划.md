　　Solving Problems Proactively Ensures Plan Completion

    The construction project of the Harbin Electricity Meter and Instrument Factory, according to the requirements of the first Five-Year Plan, should be basically completed by the end of this year, and the first batch of products must be trial-manufactured by April next year. However, by the end of the third quarter, many pieces of equipment had not yet arrived at the factory. Among them, some important equipment manufactured by the Shenyang Electrical Machinery Factory had not even been started. The resident representative sent there repeatedly urged them, but it was to no avail, and no one could say for sure when they could be manufactured. The deputy director of the factory, Na Zizhang, who was in charge of leading the construction, was very anxious.
    Just being anxious would not help, so he had to actively find solutions. Deputy Director Na decided to personally go to the Shenyang Electrical Machinery Factory to understand the situation. It turned out that the Electrical Machinery Factory had a large production task, and in order to complete its own plan, it prioritized the tasks that were fully ready for manufacturing. The order from the Electricity Meter and Instrument Factory had not been started because many parts such as electric motors had not been purchased. And those parts had to be purchased from other cities, but there was no one to send. After Deputy Director Na understood the situation, he suggested that he could send people from his own factory to be responsible for purchasing the parts. After returning to the factory, he immediately sent people to Jiamusi, Dalian, and other places to purchase them.
    More than half a month later, the Shenyang Electrical Machinery Factory and the resident representative sent there both sent letters. The letters said that because production started too late, some important equipment could not be delivered on time. Although this news was very bad, it did not stump the comrades of the Electricity Meter and Instrument Factory. Deputy Director Na asked the comrades who were sent to purchase the parts to report the confirmed delivery dates of each part, and then led the deputy section chief of the equipment section to Shenyang again.
    This time, Deputy Director Na felt that simply discussing with the director of the Shenyang Electrical Machinery Factory could not solve the problem, so he requested that some responsible cadres from the departments also be invited to discuss together. At the meeting, Deputy Director Na confirmed the dates for supplying them with parts and requested that they also confirm the delivery dates. After they calculated, they believed that they could deliver the goods at the end of the year, and at best, they could deliver them a few days earlier. Deputy Director Na was very anxious after hearing this. He said, "If that's the case, we won't have time to install them this year." Then, Deputy Director Na explained to everyone: the first batch of instruments must be trial-manufactured by the date required by the state to supply the newly built First Automobile Manufacturing Plant for assembling automobiles. He said, "If we don't install these important equipment this year, it's not just that our factory cannot be basically completed and fail to complete the state plan, but more importantly, it will affect the production of important factories such as the automobile factory." This really moved everyone's hearts. They had originally planned to deliver the goods at the end of the year because they planned to start manufacturing other parts only on the day the purchased parts arrived at the factory. If they started manufacturing other parts first, and then installed them as soon as the purchased parts arrived, it was very likely that they could deliver the goods earlier. After research and calculation by both parties, the Shenyang Electrical Machinery Factory finally guaranteed to deliver fifteen pieces of equipment successively before December 10th, and strive to complete another one on schedule. Both parties also assigned special personnel to jointly establish a joint group to directly go deep into the workshop to grasp the production of these important equipment.
    After Deputy Director Na returned to the factory, he also told the manager of the Electrical Engineering Bureau's Electromechanical Installation Engineering Company this good news. They also guaranteed: "As soon as your equipment arrives, we will install it immediately!" In order to make the completion of the task more guaranteed, Deputy Director Na also discussed with the vice chairman of the trade union in his factory and decided that the vice chairman of the trade union would personally go to Shenyang to help the Shenyang Electrical Machinery Factory's trade union mobilize workers and technicians to carry out labor competitions. As a result, the workers and technicians of the Shenyang Electrical Machinery Factory all took action. The workers who directly manufactured those important equipment all put forward guarantees for completing the task.
    The factory construction project, which was originally thought to be impossible to complete according to plan, now has the possibility of completion. This fact tells us that in capital construction, although there are many difficulties, as long as the construction unit actively helps the relevant units solve specific problems, overcome difficulties, it is entirely possible to complete the national plan. Any emphasis only on difficulties without actively and proactively solving them is wrong.

　　主动解决问题，就可以完成计划
　　康炬
    哈尔滨电表仪器厂的建厂工程，按国家第一个五年计划的要求，应该在今年年底基本完成，明年四月必须试制出第一批产品。可是到第三季度末的时候，还有不少设备没有进厂。其中沈阳电工机械厂承制的一些重要设备还没有动手制造。派去的驻厂员再三催促也不顶事，谁也不能肯定什么时候能够制造出来。负责领导建厂的那治璋副厂长心里很着急。
    光着急是无济于事的，必须积极想办法。那副厂长决定亲自到沈阳电工机械厂去了解一下。原来电工机械厂的生产任务很大，为了完成自己的计划，挑选完全具备制造条件的活先干了。电表仪器厂的订货，因为电动机等不少零件还没有采购来，便没有干。而那些零件还要派人去其他城市采购，但又没人可派。那副厂长了解了这一情况后，提出可以从自己厂里派人负责采购零件。回厂后，便立即派人分赴佳木斯、大连等地采购。
    过了半个多月，沈阳电工机械厂以及派去的驻厂员都来信了。信上说因为投入生产太晚，一些重要设备不能按期交货。这个消息虽然很不好，可也没有把电表仪器厂的同志们难住。那副厂长让派出去采购零件的同志汇报了每个零件的肯定的供应日期，于是带领了设备科副科长又去沈阳。
    这一次，那副厂长觉得单和沈阳电工机械厂厂长商讨还不能解决问题，便要求把一些科室负责干部也找来一同商量。在会上，那副厂长肯定了供给他们零件的日期，要求他们也肯定交货日期。他们一核计，认为年末可以交货，再快也只能提前几天。那副厂长听了很焦急，他说：“这样我们今年就来不及安装了。”接着，那副厂长就向大家说明：必须按国家要求的日期试制第一批仪表，供给新建成的第一汽车制造厂装汽车用。他说：“我们这些重要设备今年不安装起来，不只是我们厂不能基本完工和完不成国家计划，更重要的是要影响汽车厂等重要工厂的生产。”这一来，真把大家的心说动了。他们原先打算年底交货，是因为打算外购的零件到厂的那天才动手制造其它零件。如果先动手制造其它零件，外购零件到了就往上安装，很有可能提前交货。经过双方的研究、计算，最后，沈阳电工机械厂保证在十二月十日以前陆续交齐十五台设备，另一台也争取按期完成。双方并各自责成专人共同成立了联合组，直接深入车间掌握这些重要设备的生产。
    那副厂长回厂后，又把这个好消息告诉了电工局机电安装工程公司经理。他们也保证：“只要你们设备一到，马上就给安装！”那副厂长为了使完成任务更有保证，又和自己厂里的工会副主席商量，决定由工会副主席亲自到沈阳，帮助沈阳电工机械厂工会动员职工和技术人员开展劳动竞赛，结果，沈阳电工机械厂的工人们和技术人员们都行动起来了，直接制造那些重要设备的工人，都提出了完成任务的保证。
    原来以为没法按计划完成的建厂工程，现在有完成的可能了。这件事实告诉我们，在基本建设中，虽有很多困难，但是，只要建设单位主动帮助有关单位解决具体问题，克服困难，完成国家计划是完全可以的。任何只强调困难，而不积极地主动地解决困难是不对的。
