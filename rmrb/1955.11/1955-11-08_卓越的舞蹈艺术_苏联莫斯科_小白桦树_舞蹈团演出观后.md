Outstanding Dance Art
——After Watching the Performance of the Soviet Moscow “Little Birch Tree” Dance Ensemble
Long Yinpei

When I finished watching the performance of the Soviet Moscow “Little Birch Tree” Dance Ensemble, I felt that their dance expressed many things that cannot be expressed in words. Their performance gave us the highest artistic enjoyment, like the warm sun shining on us in the cold winter, bringing happiness. I wanted to praise their wonderful artistic creation, but I couldn't find a suitable phrase from the ocean of adjectives.

The unique style and artistic manner of the “Little Birch Tree” Dance Ensemble has a great power to attract us, making us feel exceptionally close. Each dance program centrally expresses a certain aspect of the Russian female character. The several types of programs in the evening shaped a very complete character and brilliant image of Russian women, enabling us to have a further understanding, knowledge, and love for them.

Various types of circle dances—"Little Birch Tree," "Small Chain," "Ancient Northern Circle Dance," "Swan Dance," and other programs—expressed the lyrical, gentle, pure, noble, and love for nature and the motherland of Russian women; "Stomping Dance," "Maiden Gadley Dance," "Cossack Women's Dance," and "Maiden Competition Dance" concentrated on depicting their heroic, unrestrained, enthusiastic, brave, and stubborn characters; "Parade Dance," "Comical Polka Dance," and "Merry-Go-Round Dance" meticulously depicted the lively, humorous, and witty characteristics of the girls; while "Soviet Young Women's Dance" seemed to concentrate all of these, showing the complete and typical image of Soviet women.

The reason these programs are so deeply moving is that their profound ideological content and rigorous, neat, and beautiful form are seamlessly integrated.

The "Little Birch Tree" dance is a program radiating strong brilliance in the entire performance. Before the dance began, the prelude to the music took us to the beautiful Russian wilderness. The spring breeze blew across the wildflowers in the fields, and the sunlight shone on the tender green branches of the trees, giving you a feeling of freedom, peace, and open-mindedness. Then, the girls in red holding the branches of the small birch trees came out. Their appearance seemed to bring a warm current of spring, immediately making you feel excited and happy. Their movement and changes on the stage made us feel as if they were not walking, but rather like the movement of the distant small birch trees seen through the train window as we were sitting on a train passing through the Russian plains. This steady pace gradually turned into a bright and cheerful circle dance. The dance gave us endless poetic imagination, immersing us in infinite and sublime aesthetic feeling.

"Passing Through the Door Dance," a dance depicting the game life of young girls, was loved by the audience. Pairs of girls emerged from doors made of silk. The dance revolved around the theme of passing through the door from beginning to end, creating various patterns of passing through the door, making the formation infinitely varied. This dance was like a breeze passing through the forest, making it impossible for you to detect its footprints, but also allowing you to clearly feel it. The fresh, moving, and unique artistic structure of this dance shows that the choreographer possesses a high level of artistic cultivation and has devoted enormous labor to it.

The artistic achievement of the "Small Chain" dance is equally worthy of our attention. The dancers seemed to be floating on the water, with a light breeze pushing their beautiful bodies. The connection of the movements was like a drop of water after another dripping down through the tender green lotus leaves, slowly forming a stream. The arms of these girls were like flexible and freely changing links in a chain. It was full of genius and wisdom imagination.

The "Swan Dance" is like a moving picture. The swan is a water bird symbolizing kindness, gentleness, and purity. It is appropriate to use it to describe the inner beauty and nobility of Russian women. The steady pace and symmetrical movements vividly expressed the roaming of the swans. Especially the clever design at the end: the girls used wide white sleeves and right hands wearing rings to become a flock of white swans, advancing in the ripples. This really made us forget that these were young girls dancing.

These dances are full of poetic imagination. They praise the noble virtues of Russian women and arouse our love for the beautiful things in life. They are also moving pictures of the human body, fully demonstrating the modeling role of dance art. At the same time, the music in the dance describes the inner emotions and mental state of the Russian women. The music clarifies the theme and content of the dance, makes the image of the dance more complete, and also strengthens the expressive power of the dance. These programs can be said to be a perfect combination of literature, fine arts, music, and dance into a whole. Therefore, they can give people a deep sense of infection. I think these dances are models of female lyrical dance and are especially worthy of our learning because our creations lack programs with such a high degree of artistic generalization.

"Maiden Competition Dance" and "Maiden Gadley Dance" reveal the heroic,豪迈 [Note: heroic and bold], enthusiastic character of Russian women, and their vigorous youthful vitality. The strong and broad dance posture expresses their strong optimism. Different actors have different personality characteristics, but they are united in one emotion. The dance shows the magnificent power of the Soviet people, and nothing can stop their progress.

"Parade Dance" and "Comical Polka Dance" are programs with a strong atmosphere of life and full of humor. They both have dramatic plots, and the actors in these two dances showed a high degree of performing talent, and the portrayal of the characters is truly meticulous. For example, in "Parade Dance," the accordion player initially does not want to accompany the girls' dance, so they use all means to beg him, making it impossible for him to refuse; and when he plays the accordion in a rhythm that does not meet the requirements of their dance, the girls deliberately make disappointed expressions and sounds, expressing their inner desire: hoping that he will play well. When the accordion player truly plays enthusiastically, the girls dance to their heart's content, and each performs their best dance, and finally shake hands with the accordion player to express their gratitude. At the end, the girls express their joy and happiness in satisfying their desire to dance, which is very profound and moving. In "Comical Polka Dance," the four girls' teasing of the accordion player, although it is a prank, further expresses their friendship towards him. At the beginning of this dance, they were joyful in their hearts but pretended to be calm on the surface, all performing very well. These two programs are also loved by the audience. The characters' personalities and emotional changes are closely intertwined in the development of the plot, making it easy for people to understand, and the humor gives people great joy. Although this is only a short depiction of a life fragment, it contains great significance. It directly expresses the most interesting events in life, explains the living conditions of Soviet society, and can strengthen people's love for today's happy life. It is educational.

"Soviet Young Women's Dance" is a large-scale dance. The neat rows move forward, showing that Soviet youth have a firm belief in the victory of the communist cause, a determination to overcome all difficulties in construction. They love the cause of peace, and they are strong fighters defending peace.... What is exciting is the brisk and joyful rhythm of the dance, the vigorous vitality of the youth, and the Soviet youth's praise for their happy life. Singing is an indispensable part of this program. The audience welcomed it with the warmest applause because the content expressed by the program is so closely related to us.

Every program attracts us like a magnet, which shows Comrade Nadezhdina's profound ideological and artistic cultivation, her love for the people and life, and also shows her in-depth research on folk dance. Nadezhdina once said: "The basic principle of engaging in folk dance work is to love the people, love the people's creation, and have the ability to observe this creation with the eyes of a poet." "If you want to express dance on the stage, you should 'improve' it, make it poetic, and expand it in scale. All the most touching, vivid, and beautiful movements should be carefully selected and combined into a complete, logically developing work full of sublime ideas. In order to achieve this, dance on the stage must have a folk basis." These words are Comrade Nadezhdina's specific experiences and insights in her work, which are very helpful to our country's dance workers.

The visit and performance of the "Little Birch Tree" Dance Ensemble to China has enabled us to understand the great achievements made by Soviet dance art from specific programs. We would like to express our deepest gratitude to the Soviet artists. (Attached pictures)

    卓越的舞蹈艺术
    ——苏联莫斯科“小白桦树”舞蹈团演出观后
    隆荫培
    当我看完了苏联莫斯科“小白桦树”舞蹈团的演出的时候，我觉得她们的舞蹈表现了许多不能用语言文字来表达的东西。她们的演出，使我们得到了最高的艺术享受，就像那在严寒的冬天，温暖的太阳照耀着我们一样的幸福。我想赞美她们在艺术上的精彩创造，但是从形容词的海洋里，却找不到一个恰当的词句。
    “小白桦树”舞蹈团独特的风格和艺术作风，有着巨大的力量吸引着我们，使我们感到异常的亲切。每一个舞蹈节目都集中地表现了俄罗斯妇女性格的某一方面，晚会中几种类型的节目给俄罗斯妇女塑造了非常完整的性格和光辉的形象，使我们对她们有了更进一步的认识、了解和热爱。
    各种不同的环舞——“小白桦树”、“小链子”、“古代的北方环舞”、“天鹅舞”等节目，表现了俄罗斯妇女那种抒情、温柔、纯洁、高尚和对大自然、对祖国的热爱等性格的素质；“踏步舞”、“少女加德利舞”、“哥萨克女子舞”和“少女竞演舞”等节目，又集中地描绘了她们那种豪迈、奔放、热情和勇敢、倔强等性格；“巡行舞”、“滑稽波尔卡舞”和“回转木马舞”等节目细致地刻划了少女们活泼、幽默和风趣的特性；而“苏维埃女青年舞”，又好像集中了这一切，表现出完整的典型的苏联妇女形象。
    这些节目的所以感人至深，就是因为它们的深刻的思想内容和严谨、整洁、优美的形式完整无间地融合在一起。
    “小白桦树”舞是全部演出中放射着强烈光彩的节目。舞蹈开始以前，音乐的前奏曲就把我们带到美丽的俄罗斯原野上去，春天的风吹拂着田间的小花，阳光照耀着树的嫩绿枝条，给你一种自由、平静和心胸开阔的感觉。接着穿红衣的少女拿着小白桦的树枝出来了，她们的出现真好像带来了一种春天的暖流，立刻使你感到兴奋和愉快。她们在舞台上的移动、变化，使我们感觉到仿佛不是她们在行走，而是我们坐着火车穿过俄罗斯大平原时在车窗所看到的远方小白桦树的移动一样。这种平稳的步伐渐渐地变成了明快爽朗的环舞。舞蹈使我们有说不尽的诗意想像，使我们沉醉在无限和崇高的美感之中。
    “穿门舞”这个表现少女们游戏生活的舞蹈受到了观众的热爱。一对对姑娘们从用绸造成的门里钻出来，舞蹈从始至终就围绕着这个穿门的主题，造成了各式各样穿门的花样，使队伍变化无穷。这个舞蹈就像微风在树林里穿一样，使你不能发觉它的足迹，但又能使你很清楚地感到它。这个舞蹈的清新动人和独特的艺术结构说明了编导者是具备着高度的艺术修养和花费了巨大的劳动的。
    “小链子”舞在艺术上所达到的成就同样值得我们重视。舞蹈者仿佛漂浮在水面上，轻风推动着她们美丽的身躯。动作的连接就像一个水珠接着一个水珠经过嫩绿的荷叶滴落下去，慢慢地形成一条细流一样。这些少女的手臂仿佛是一种链子中灵活变化自如的连环。这里面充满了天才和智慧的想像。
    “天鹅舞”仿佛是动的图画。天鹅是一种象征着善良、温柔、纯洁的水鸟，用它来形容俄罗斯妇女内心的美丽和高尚是再恰当不过的了。平稳的步伐、匀称的动作，形象地表现了天鹅的漫游。尤其是最后巧妙的设计：姑娘们利用宽大的白色衣袖和戴有戒指的右手变成了一队白色的天鹅，她们在微波中前进着。这真使我们忘记了这是少女们在舞蹈。
    这些舞蹈里面充满了诗意的想像，它歌颂了俄罗斯妇女崇高的品德，唤起我们对生活中美好事物的热爱。它们又是人体的动的图画，充分发挥了舞蹈艺术的造型作用。同时，音乐在舞蹈中描述着俄罗斯妇女们内心的情感和精神状态，音乐给我们阐明了舞蹈的主题和内容，音乐使舞蹈的形象更加完整，同时也加强了舞蹈的表现力。这些节目可以说是文学、美术、音乐和舞蹈完美结合成的一个整体。所以它们才能给人深刻的感染。我认为这些舞蹈是女子抒情舞蹈的典范，是特别值得我们学习的，因为在我们的创作中正是缺乏这样具有高度艺术概括力的节目。
    “少女竞演舞”和“少女加德利舞”表露出俄罗斯妇女的英勇、豪迈、热情的性格，和她们那种旺盛的青春活力。健壮、开阔的舞姿表现了她们强烈的乐观情绪。不同的演员有着不同的性格特点，但又在一种情绪中统一起来。舞蹈表现出苏联人那种雄伟的力量，什么也阻挡不了他们的前进。
    “巡行舞”和“滑稽波尔卡舞”都是生活气息很浓和富有幽默感的节目。它们都带有戏剧性的情节，演员们在这两个舞蹈中都表现了高度的表演天才，对角色的刻划真是细致入微。例如“巡行舞”中，手风琴手开始不愿意给姑娘们伴奏舞蹈，她们便使用一切办法哀求他，使得他无法拒绝；而当他奏起手风琴不合乎她们舞蹈所要求的节奏时，姑娘们便故意做出失望的表情和声音，表示了她们内心的要求：希望他好好伴奏。手风琴手真正热情地奏起来的时候，姑娘们便尽情地跳了起来，每人都把自己跳得最好的舞蹈表演出来，最后又和手风琴手握手表示对他的感谢。结束时姑娘们表现出满足了自己跳舞欲望的欣喜和快乐，是非常深刻动人的。“滑稽波尔卡舞”四个女孩对手风琴手的捉弄，虽然是恶作剧，但是通过它更表现了对他的友好。这个舞蹈开始时，她们内心喜悦而表面又故作镇静，都表演得非常出色。这两个节目也是观众所热爱的，它们的人物性格和感情的变化都紧密地交织在情节的发展中，很容易使人了解，风趣和幽默给人巨大的欢欣。虽然这只是一个简短生活片断的描写，但是它包含了巨大的意义。它直接表现了生活当中最有趣的事件，说明了苏联社会的生活面貌，能够使人们加强对于今天幸福生活的热爱，它是有教育作用的。
    “苏维埃女青年舞”是一个大型的舞蹈，整齐的行列向前进，显示了苏联青年们有着对于共产主义事业胜利的确信，有着在建设中克服一切困难的决心，他们热爱着和平事业，他们是保卫和平的坚强战士……。它激动人心的是舞蹈那种明快欢欣的节奏、青年蓬勃的朝气，还有那苏联青年对自己幸福生活的歌颂。歌唱是这个节目不可缺少的部分。观 众以最热烈的掌声来欢迎它，就是因为节目所表现的内容是如此和我们息息相关。
    每一个节目都像磁石一样吸引着我们，这显示了纳杰日金娜同志思想修养和艺术修养的高深、对人民对生活的热爱，同时也可以看出她对民间舞蹈的深入研究。纳杰日金娜曾说：“从事民间舞蹈工作的基本原则，就是要热爱人民、热爱人民的创作，并且要具有以诗人的眼光去观察这种创作的技能。”“要想在舞台上表现舞蹈，就应该将它‘提高’，使它富有诗意，并且要在规模上加以扩大。所有一切最动人的、鲜明的、优美的动作，都应当是精选出来的，并把它们汇成一个完整的、在逻辑上发展着的、富有崇高的思想的作品。为了做到这一点，舞台上的舞蹈就必须要有民间的基础。”这些话是纳杰日金娜同志工作中的具体经验和体会，对于我国的舞蹈工作者来说是非常有帮助的。
    “小白桦树”舞蹈团的访华演出，使我们从具体的节目中了解了苏联舞蹈艺术所获得的巨大成就，我们要向苏联的艺术家们致以最深厚的谢意。（附图片）
