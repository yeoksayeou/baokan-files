Solve New Problems, Consolidate Cooperatives

New situations are bound to bring many new problems. Recently, after inspecting the new situation of the great development of agricultural cooperativization in various places, almost all of them said: The development of the movement is smooth and healthy, but many new problems are urgently to be solved. For example, in many places, the preparatory work for establishing cooperatives cannot keep up with the progress of the movement, and the training of key personnel and the publicity of policies are not sufficient; many regions have not had time to carefully consider the overall plan for agricultural cooperativization, so they have not been able to uniformly allocate cadre forces and party member forces, and some new cooperatives have not formed a leading force with poor peasants as the core for a while; some cadres have not fully grasped the policies, and there are still phenomena of excluding poor peasants and forcibly pulling in middle peasants, and even some landlord and rich peasant elements have mixed into some agricultural production cooperatives; many newly established cooperatives have not established production order, do not know how to organize collective labor, some lack experience in evaluating the means of production, and are particularly bad at implementing mutually beneficial policies in the evaluation work; many newly expanded old cooperatives feel a headache in arranging the relationship between new and old members, and new and old cadres; some places have appeared "middle peasant cooperatives", or individual households outside the cooperatives are emotionally disturbed; many old cooperatives also encounter various problems when further developing and transforming into advanced cooperatives. The emergence of these new problems proves that the agricultural cooperativization movement has taken a big step forward. The task before our rural Party organizations is to solve these problems in a timely manner and immediately shift the focus of our work from developing agricultural production cooperatives to consolidating and consolidating agricultural production cooperatives.

Are many problems bad phenomena? Some people think that "the situation is not good" when they hear "many problems," which is wrong. Of course, it is not good if the movement is not developing well in individual areas and there are many problems, and it should be solved immediately. In fact, there are also many problems in areas where the movement is developing well, and they should also be solved immediately, which is not a bad phenomenon. In areas with good development, there are many cooperatives, large cooperatives, and many farmers participating in the cooperatives, and there are also many problems. Moreover, cooperativization is so fast that some shortcomings and deviations are inevitable, and many new difficulties are even more inevitable. At the same time, the faster the cooperativization, the greater the impact on all aspects of the work, and the more new problems are raised to all aspects. Many new problems often come unexpectedly and cannot be imagined. It should be affirmed that in these areas, new problems are like bamboo shoots after a rain, which are new phenomena under the new situation. These new problems attract us to study and solve them. Our cause is to continue to move forward in the process of constantly solving these constantly occurring new problems.

The Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently studied the new situation of the agricultural cooperativization movement in the province and believed that under this new situation, the attitude of cadres in various places towards these new problems can be roughly divided into three types. The vast majority of cadres are encouraged by the upsurge of the socialist mass movement, and they actively, enthusiastically, and wholeheartedly go to discover and solve these new problems, and in the process of constantly solving these new problems, they make the new and old agricultural production cooperatives more consolidated and improved. However, there are also a few cadres who, facing a large number of developed cooperatives, only see shortcomings, emphasize difficulties, and only feel that their ability is not strong and their experience is insufficient, so they lack the courage to solve new problems and overcome new difficulties; some people even deliberately avoid difficulties, and some district and township cadres have been found in individual areas who only go to cooperatives with fewer problems and are unwilling to go to cooperatives with more problems. There are also a few cadres who are blindly optimistic and complacent when they see that the masses are very enthusiastic and the cooperatives are developing very well, and they have overfulfilled their tasks. They only look at the achievements, not the shortcomings, ignore the difficulties, and therefore do not do the arduous and meticulous work of rectifying and consolidating the cooperatives, and do not solve the many new problems that are constantly occurring.

Obviously, the second and third attitudes are wrong. Comrades who hold these two attitudes are the kind of people who have been "frightened by victory" and "dizzy by victory" as Comrade Mao Zedong once pointed out. Agricultural production cooperatives have greatly developed, the socialist front has greatly expanded, and the capitalist front has greatly shrunk. This is a good thing, a lovable thing, what is there to be afraid of? Should a revolutionary be afraid of the growth of socialist forces? It should be understood that although the number of cooperatives has increased, and new problems and new difficulties have increased, the strength of socialism is also growing, and the strength of cadres and the masses is also growing. The conditions for solving problems are better, and the strength to overcome difficulties is stronger. As long as the task of overcoming these difficulties is not regarded as the task of a few cadres, but as the collective task of cadres and the masses; those comrades who lack courage, as long as they put themselves into this great collective and become an active fighter in this collective, then the new problems before us can certainly be solved, and the new difficulties can certainly be overcome. Of course, this requires us to continue to carry out a lot of arduous and meticulous work. Those who are so happy to see achievements that they forget to move forward, and complacent emotions will paralyze their nerves and blind their eyes, so they cannot consolidate the existing achievements, let alone strive for greater achievements.

Only the first attitude is correct. According to materials from various places, comrades who adopt this attitude not only account for the majority, but also have created many ways to solve new problems in their active work. Their experience has repeatedly proved that as long as we can enthusiastically meet the new situation of the great development of cooperativization and actively discover problems; as long as we can closely rely on the grassroots cadres and the broad masses, and use collective strength to solve problems; as long as we can be good at grasping the current central link and solve problems step by step in a planned way; then, this work of constantly discovering problems and constantly solving problems is constantly installing steel bars or pouring buckets of cement for the great project of agricultural cooperativization.

The cooperativization movement is developing enthusiastically, and the enthusiasm of the broad masses of grassroots cadres and farmers is even more enthusiastic than during the land reform. Many major cadres at the provincial, special zone, county, and district levels are also throwing themselves into the movement with great enthusiasm. They go deep into the masses to discover problems, solve problems on the spot, and improve the ability of grassroots cadres to discover and solve problems from practical work. Making the leadership of cooperativization more in-depth at the lower level and closer to the masses is a more significant feature of the current leadership style. In October, Shanxi Province had more than 10,000 cadres at the provincial, special zone, and county levels going deep into the countryside. The secretary of the Wuming County Party Committee and the Minister of the Rural Work Department of Guangxi Province even temporarily moved the County Party Committee Office to key townships to help work, solve problems, and promote experience on the spot. The Yancheng County Party Committee of Jiangsu Province led fifteen rectification work groups, led by the secretary of the county party committee, to areas where work was relatively weak to assist in the rectification work and create rectification experience. These methods of making the leadership above the county level directly approach the lower level are the most needed methods in the current movement. The method of still being high above, only relying on listening to reports and reading reports, or only sending cadres and staff members to the countryside, must be corrected immediately.

If we only rely on a few leading cadres to go deep into the countryside and do not rely on the strength of grassroots cadres and the broad masses of cooperative members, we cannot promptly handle the many new problems in the large-scale mass movement. Leading cadres should also be good at relying on the strength of grassroots cadres and activists of cooperative members, organize them and help them solve problems, and improve their policy level and cooperative management ability from this practical exercise. Wherever this is done, many problems that seem very complicated and difficult can also be solved very smoothly. Under the premise of not affecting the old cooperatives, the Xuchang Prefectural Committee of Henan Province transferred some cooperative directors, accountants, production team leaders, and activists from the old cooperatives to form a "cooperative guidance group" to help the new cooperatives quickly consolidate and establish production order. The Xuchang Prefectural Committee also adopted the method of sending old cooperative cadres to work in new cooperatives for a period of time, or sending new cooperative cadres to study in old cooperatives for a period of time. The Xuchang County Party Committee recently held a contact meeting of new and old cooperative directors, and the new and old cooperatives that were very close to each other voluntarily signed mutual assistance and mutual love contracts. In the face of the new problem of a general lack of accounting talents, the Jintan County Committee of Jiangsu Province immediately selected a group of primary and secondary school students with good backgrounds and promising prospects and cooperative members with a certain level of education, and adopted the method of "teaching, learning, and establishing accounts at the same time." In October, it trained more than 500 accountants in 40 townships, and quickly enabled more than 300 new cooperatives to establish new accounts. These methods, including the mutual aid and cooperation committee, the mutual aid and cooperation network, the cooperative union, the central cooperative, the accounting guidance station, and other methods that have long been effectively implemented, are all good methods to rely on grassroots cadres and cooperative activists to solve the large number of new problems that are constantly occurring under the new situation of the great development of cooperativization. The method of only being handled by a few leading cadres and work group cadres of the higher-level organs should be immediately corrected.

Since there are so many new problems, and they are constantly occurring, we must be good at grasping the important links, be good at grasping the most important, fundamental, and key problems in some large and small problems, and solve them first. In this way, through the solution of these problems, many other problems can be easily solved. Cultivating the ability of grassroots cadres and activists to grasp the key is a very important task. The weather in Hebei Province was not good this year, and the autumn crops matured late. When a large number of new cooperatives were established, it was the time when picking cotton, harvesting corn, digging sweet potatoes, and planting winter wheat were all squeezed together. Under this circumstance, if the new cooperatives still follow the old rules to carry out the evaluation of the means of production and the work of ordering the cooperative charter first, they will disperse their strength, miss the production season, and affect production. The Party committees at all levels led the new cooperatives to immediately focus on harvesting autumn and planting wheat. The expanded old cooperatives, new members immediately joined the team and immediately started production. The newly established cooperatives first formed temporary production teams, and uniformly organized manpower and animal power according to the principle of mutual benefit to harvest autumn and plant wheat. As a result, the province overfulfilled the wheat planting plan by the end of October. This made the first shot of the cooperative sound very loud, fully demonstrating the superiority of the cooperative at the beginning, and consolidated the enthusiasm of the masses to join the cooperative. Under this circumstance, concentrating on grasping production first became the key to consolidating the cooperative. In some areas, the ideological mobilization work was done relatively roughly, so they focused on publicizing the party's policies and methods well, and resolutely did not force those who were not willing to join the cooperative for the time being to join the cooperative; everyone was willing to join the cooperative, and various problems were relatively easy to solve. In some areas, the class policy was not well implemented, so they focused on checking the composition of cooperative cadres and members in conjunction with party and league rectification, cleaning up landlord and rich peasant elements and other bad elements who had mixed into the cooperative, correcting the phenomenon of excluding poor peasants, and establishing the leading advantage of poor peasants (including lower-middle peasants) in the cooperative. The cooperative was purified organizationally, and many problems were solved along with it. Some areas have already begun to use the evaluation of the means of production as the center to carry out cooperative rectification work. This method of first concentrating efforts to solve key problems based on the different circumstances at the time and place is even more important in places where large-scale mass movements are developing rapidly and various new problems are emerging one after another. The method of treating the head when the head hurts and treating the foot when the foot hurts, and the busy and chaotic pragmatism of grabbing here and there, is even more necessary to change immediately.

In the face of the new situation of the great development of agricultural cooperativization, various new atmospheres are encouraging us, and various new problems are attracting us. The responsibility of Party organizations in various places is to educate and organize cadres to go deep into the movement, rely on the activists in the movement, solve problems in a planned and step-by-step manner, do a good job in rectifying and consolidating cooperatives, and ensure that the cooperativization movement always develops healthily.

### 解决新问题，巩固合作社

　　解决新问题，巩固合作社
    新形势一定带来很多新问题。最近各地在检查农业合作化大发展的新情况以后，几乎都说：运动的发展是顺利的健康的，但是急待解决的新问题却很多。比如许多地方建社准备工作赶不上运动的进展，训练骨干和宣传政策都作得不够；不少地区农业合作化的全面规划来不及细致地考虑，因而对干部力量、党员力量来不及统一配备，有些新社一时也没有形成以贫农为核心的领导力量；有些干部没有全面地掌握政策，还有排斥贫农和强拉中农的现象，甚至有些农业生产合作社还混进了一些地主富农分子；不少新建社的生产秩序还没有建立起来，不知道怎样组织集体劳动，有的缺乏评议生产资料的经验，特别不善于在评议工作中贯彻执行互利政策；不少新扩大的老社，在安排新老社员、新老干部的关系上感到头痛；有的地方出现了“中农社”，或者社外单干户情绪不安；许多老社在进一步发展和转为高级社的时候也遇到各种问题。这些新问题的出现，证明农业合作化运动已经前进了一大步。摆在我们农村党组织面前的任务，就是及时去解决这些问题，把我们的工作重心立即由发展农业生产合作社的工作转到整顿和巩固农业生产合作社的工作。
    问题多，是不是就是坏现象呢？有的人一听说
  “问题多”，就认为“情况不好”，这是不对的。当然，个别地区运动发展得不好，问题很多，这是不好的，应该立即去解决。其实，运动发展得很好的地区，问题也很多，也应该立即去解决，这不是坏现象。发展得好的地区，社多，社大，参加社的农户多，问题也多。而且，合作化这样快，也免不了有一些缺点和偏差，更免不了有很多新的困难。同时，合作化越快，对各方面的工作影响也越大，向各方面提出的新问题也越多，有很多新问题还常常出人意外，想像不到。应该肯定，在这些地区，新问题像雨后春笋，正是新形势下的新现象，这些新问题吸引着我们去研究、去解决。我们的事业，就是在不断解决这些不断发生的新问题的过程中不断前进。
    中共山东省委最近研究了全省农业合作化运动的新情况，认为在这种新形势下，各地干部对待这些新问题的态度，大体可以分为三种。绝大多数的干部，受到社会主义群众运动高潮的鼓舞，他们积极地、热情地、全力以赴地去发现和解决这些新问题，并在不断解决这些新问题中使新的和老的农业生产合作社更加巩固更加提高。但是也有少数干部，面对着大量发展起来的合作社，只看到缺点，强调困难，只感到自己能力不强，经验不足，因而缺乏解决新问题和克服新困难的勇气；有的人甚至有意回避困难，个别地区已经发现有的区乡干部只到问题少的社去，而不愿意到问题多的社去。还有少数干部看见群众热情很高，合作社发展得很好，超额完成了任务，就盲目乐观和骄傲自满起来。他们只看成绩，不看缺点，忽视困难，因而不去做艰苦细致的整顿和巩固合作社的工作，不去解决不断发生的许多新问题。
    很显然，第二种和第三种态度都是错误的态度。抱这两种态度的同志，正是毛泽东同志曾经指出的那种被“胜利吓昏了头脑”的人和被“胜利冲昏了头脑”的人。农业生产合作社大发展了，社会主义的阵地大大扩张了，资本主义的阵地就大大缩小了，这是好事，是可喜可爱的事，有什么可怕呢？难道一个革命者应该怕社会主义力量的增长吗？应该了解：合作社增多了，新的问题和新的困难虽然增多，但是社会主义的力量也在增长，干部和群众的力量也在增长，解决问题的条件更好了，克服困难的力量更强了。只要把克服这些困难的任务，不看成是少数干部个人的任务，而看成是干部和群众的集体任务；那些缺乏勇气的同志，只要把自己投入这个伟大的集体里去，成为这个集体中的一个积极的战士，那末，摆在我们面前的新问题就一定可以解决，新困难就一定能够克服。当然，这就要求我们继续进行很多艰苦细致的工作。那种看见成绩就高兴得忘掉前进的人，骄傲自满情绪就会麻痹他们的神经和蒙蔽他们的眼睛，他们就不能巩固现有的成绩，更不能争取更大的成绩。
    只有第一种态度才是正确的。根据各地的材料，采取这种态度的同志不只是占多数，而且在他们的积极工作中，还创造了很多解决新问题的办法。他们的经验一再证明：只要我们能够热情地去迎接合作化大发展的新形势，去主动地发现问题；只要能够紧密地依靠基层干部和广大群众，用集体力量去解决问题；只要能够善于抓住当前的中心环节，有计划有步骤地去逐步解决问题；那末，这种不断发现问题和不断解决问题的工作，就是为农业合作化的伟大工程不断装上一根一根的钢筋或者灌进一桶一桶的水泥。
    合作化运动在热烈地开展，广大基层干部和农民群众的情绪比土地改革时还要热烈。省级、专区级、县级和区级党委的很多主要干部，也怀着很高的热情投入到运动中去。他们深入群众去发现问题，去就地解决问题，而且从实际工作中去提高基层干部发现问题和解决问题的能力。使合作化的领导更深入下层、更接近群众，就是目前领导作风上一个比较显著的特点。山西省十月份就有省级、专区级和县级的三级干部一万多人深入到农村去。广西省武鸣县的县委书记和农村工作部部长还把县委办公室暂时搬到重点乡，就地帮助工作、解决问题和推广经验。江苏省盐城县委由县委书记等人带领十五个整社工作组，到工作比较薄弱的地区，去协助整社工作和创造整社经验。这些使县以上的领导直接接近下层的作法，是当前运动最需要的办法。那种仍然高高在上、只靠听汇报和看报告或者只派干事和科员下乡的办法，必须立即纠正过来。
    如果只靠少数领导干部深入农村，不依靠基层干部和广大的社员群众的力量，也不能及时处理大规模群众运动中的很多新问题。领导干部还应该善于依靠基层干部和社员积极分子的力量，组织他们和帮助他们去解决问题，并从这种实际锻炼中提高他们的政策水准和办社能力。凡是这样作的地方，很多看起来很复杂很困难的问题，也可以很顺利地得到解决。河南省许昌地委在不影响老社的原则下，从老社中抽调了一些社长、会计、生产队长、积极分子等组成“办社辅导团”，去帮助新社迅速得到巩固，建立了生产秩序。许昌地委还采用了派老社干部到新社工作一个时期的办法，或者派新社干部到老社去学习一个时期的办法。许昌县委最近还召开新老社社长联系会议，相隔很近的新老社还自愿签订了互助互爱合同。江苏省金坛县县委会，在普遍缺乏会计人材的新问题面前，立即选择了一批成份好、有培养前途的中小学生和有一定文化水平的社员，采用“边教、边学、边建账”的办法，在十月份就在四十个乡训练了五百多名会计，很快就使三百多个新社建立了新账。这些办法，包括早已实行有效的互助合作委员会、互助合作网、合作联社、中心社、会计指导站等等办法，都是依靠基层干部和合作社积极分子，在合作化大发展的新形势下，解决不断发生的大量新问题的良好办法。那种只由上级机关的领导干部和工作组干部少数人员包办代替的办法，就更应该立即加以纠正了。
    新问题既然那样多，而且在不断发生，我们就要善于抓住重要的环节，善于在若干大大小小的问题中去抓住当前最重要的、带根本性质的和带关键性质的问题，首先加以解决。这样，就能通过这些问题的解决，使其他很多问题迎刃而解。培养基层干部和积极分子这种善于抓关键的能力，是十分重要的任务。河北省今年天气不好，秋庄稼熟得晚，大批新社建立起来的时候，正是摘棉花、收玉米、刨红薯和种冬麦都挤在一起的时候。在这种情况下，新社如果仍然按照老规矩先去进行生产资料评议工作、先去进行订社章的工作，就会分散力量，错过生产节令，影响生产。各级党委就领导新社立即抓紧收秋和种麦。扩大了的老社，新社员随入社随编队，立即生产。新建的社先编起临时生产队，按照互利原则统一组织人力畜力，进行收秋和种麦。结果，到十月底全省就超额完成了种麦计划。这就使合作社第一炮打得挺响，开头就充分显示了合作社的优越性，巩固了群众的入社热情。在这种情况下，首先集中力量抓紧生产，就成了巩固合作社的关键。有的地区思想发动工作做得比较粗糙，就注重好好地宣传党的方针政策和办法，对于那些暂时还不愿入社的人，坚决不强迫他们入社；大家都是心甘情愿地入社，各种问题就比较容易解决。有的地区没有很好执行阶级政策，就注重结合整党整团工作，检查社干部和社员的成份，清洗混入社内的地主富农分子和其他坏分子，纠正排斥贫农的现象，树立起贫农（包括下中农）在合作社里的领导优势。合作社在组织上纯洁了，很多问题也就随着解决了。有些地区已经开始以评议生产资料为中心来进行整社工作。这种根据当时当地的各种不同情况，首先集中力量去解决关键性的问题的办法，在大规模的群众运动迅速开展、各种新问题层出不穷的地方，也就显得更加重要了。那种头痛医头、脚痛医脚的办法，那种东抓一下西抓一下的忙忙乱乱的事务主义的作法，也就更加显得必须立即改变了。
    在农业合作化大发展的新形势面前，各种新气象鼓舞着我们，各种新问题吸引着我们。各地党组织的责任，就是教育和组织干部深入到运动中去，依靠运动中的积极分子，有计划有步骤地去解决问题，作好整顿和巩固合作社的工作，保证合作化运动始终健康地发展下去。
