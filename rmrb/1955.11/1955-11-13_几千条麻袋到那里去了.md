To the Editor:

　　The Nanyang Oils Company of Henan Province purchased a large number of gunny sacks last year in preparation for the autumn harvest season. However, due to the company and its branch institutions being very irresponsible in the management and use of these gunny sacks, thousands of them have gone missing. For example, the Xinye office found that the actual inventory of gunny sacks was more than five thousand three hundred fewer than the number on the books during a stocktaking. As a result, two hundred were found at the local Cotton, Yarn and Fabric Company, and more than three hundred were found at the Salt Company, but the rest could not be found. However, every time it rains, people can see some residents in the streets using the Oils Company's gunny sacks to cover themselves from the rain. No one knows how these gunny sacks ended up outside. Furthermore, the actual inventory of gunny sacks at the Deng County office was more than one thousand five hundred fewer than the number on the books; however, the toilet curtains in the local cooperative and the mattresses of many government staff were made of the Oils Company's gunny sacks, and even some farmers were using the Oils Company's gunny sacks as bedding for their livestock.

　　Why is the Nanyang Oils Company treating state property so irresponsibly? It is suggested that the Henan Province Oils Company conduct an inspection and handle this matter.

### 几千条麻袋到那里去了

　  几千条麻袋到那里去了编辑同志：
    河南省南阳油脂公司去年为了迎接秋收旺季，购买了大批麻袋。由于这个公司和所属分支机构对这批麻袋的使用管理很不负责，因此成千条麻袋不知去向了。例如，新野办事处在清产中发现库存麻袋比账面应有数少了五千三百多条，结果在当地花纱布公司找到了二百多条，在盐业公司又找到了三百多条，其余的就查不到了。但是，每逢下雨天，人们就可以在街上看见一些居民用油脂公司的麻袋披在肩上遮雨，这些麻袋究竟怎样流失到外面去的也没人知道。又如，邓县办事处的麻袋实存数比账面应有数少了一千五百多条；但是当地合作社的厕所门帘和不少机关工作人员的床垫用的都是油脂公司的麻袋，甚至有些农民的牲畜垫子也是油脂公司的麻袋。
    南阳油脂公司为什么对待国家财产这样不负责任呢？建议河南省油脂公司进行检查和处理。
