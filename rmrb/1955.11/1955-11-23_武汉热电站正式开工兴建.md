　  Wuhan Thermal Power Plant Officially Starts Construction

    The large-scale Wuhan Thermal Power Plant officially started construction on the 21st.

    According to the provisions of the First Five-Year Plan, many large-scale industrial enterprises, such as the Wuhan Iron and Steel Complex, the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant, and the Hankou Meat Processing Complex, will be built in the Wuhan area. These enterprises have modern technology and equipment and require a large amount of electricity. The Wuhan Thermal Power Plant is being built to supply power for the construction and production of these enterprises. After the Wuhan Thermal Power Plant is completed, it will also supply electricity to the emerging industrial city of Huangshi; in addition to generating electricity, it also produces steam and hot water, which can meet various needs in industrial production.

    The Wuhan Thermal Power Plant project involves a large workload and high technical requirements. Therefore, from the beginning of leveling the plant base, mechanized and factory-based construction methods have been widely adopted. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

　  武汉热电站正式开工兴建
    规模巨大的武汉热电站已经在二十一日正式开工兴建。
    根据第一个五年计划的规定，武汉地区将兴建武汉钢铁联合企业、武汉重型工具机厂、汉口肉类联合加工厂等许多个规模宏大的工业企业。这些企业具有现代化的技术装备，需要大量的电力。武汉热电站就是为供应这些企业施工和生产所用的动力而兴建的。武汉热电站建成后，还要供应新兴的工业城市——黄石市的用电；除了生产电力外，还生产蒸汽和热水，能供应工业生产上的各种需要。
    武汉热电站的工程量很大，技术要求也高，因而从平整厂基开始，就大量采用了机械化、工厂化的施工方法。（据新华社讯）
