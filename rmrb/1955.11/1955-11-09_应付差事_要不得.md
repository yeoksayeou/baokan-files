“Perfunctory Work” Must Be Avoided
　　Recently, the vast majority of trainees participating in the Henan Province Xiping County cooperative establishment training class have very high learning enthusiasm and great confidence in establishing cooperatives. However, a small number of people do not meet the conditions for participating in the training. For example, one trainee was a sixteen-year-old girl who cried because she missed home; and another trainee, named Cui Guozheng, did not participate in mass activities much in the past. People training with him reflected, "After studying for ten days or so, we haven't heard what kind of accent Cui Guozheng has." What is going on? It turns out that some townships in this county did not treat the selection of trainees as a major event in running the cooperatives well, but instead treated it as a "chore" to be dealt with perfunctorily. Some township leaders believed that work is busy now, and if the activists leave, the work will not be easy to carry out. Therefore, they adopted a completely wrong principle: "Send whoever is idle!" For example, in Zhuantan Township, Honghe District, the framework of a new cooperative has already been set up, with one party member, five members of the Communist Youth League, and two mutual aid team leaders in the cooperative. However, none of these people who met the training conditions went, but instead they sent Zhang Erni, who did not participate in mass activities much! They didn't think about what the result would be of training such "idle" people as cooperative establishment cadres!
　　Of course, the problem does not lie entirely in the fact that the township leaders must recognize their mistakes. The county's party organization is also responsible. Why didn't they review the cooperative establishment cadres to be trained?

### “应付差事”要不得

    “应付差事”要不得
    最近，参加河南省西平县建社骨干训练班的学员，绝大部分人的学习情绪很高，建社信心很大。但是也有一少部分人是不合乎参加受训的条件的。比如，有一个学员是想家想得哭鼻子的十六岁的小姑娘；还有一个学员是一向不大参加群众活动的，名叫崔国正，和他一块受训的人反映说：“学习了十来天，没听见崔国正说话是啥腔。”这是怎么回事呢？原来，这个县的部分乡没有把挑选受训的学员当作办好合作社的一件大事去办理，而是当作“差事”一样去应付。有的乡的领导人认为，现在工作忙，积极分子走了工作不好搞，于是就采取了一个完全错误的原则：
  “谁闲送谁去”！例如洪河区专探乡有一个新社的架子已经搭起，社里有党员一人，团员五人，互助组长二人，但是这些合乎受训条件的人，一个也没去，反而把不大参加群众活动的一个名叫张二妮的送去了！他们就没想一想，训练这样一些“闲”人作建社骨干会有什么结果！
    当然，问题并不完全在于乡的领导人员要认识错误，县的党组织同样要负责任，为什么不对受训的建社骨干加以审查呢？
