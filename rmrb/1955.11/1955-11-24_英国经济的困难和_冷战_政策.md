　　The economic situation in Britain has gradually deteriorated since the second half of last year, and this trend has continued for more than a year, and the situation is becoming more and more serious.

　　An important sign of the deterioration of the British economic situation is the continuous reduction of gold and dollar reserves. The UK's gold and dollar reserves at the end of July 1954 were $3,013 million, but by the end of September this year, they had fallen to $2,345 million. More than half of the decrease was caused by losses in July, August and September this year. At present, Britain's gold and dollar reserves are far below the level when the Labor government stepped down in 1951, and that level was then described by the Conservative Party as "a level that would lead to a crisis." It can be seen from this how tense the economic situation in Britain is at present.

　　One reason for this tension is the sharp increase in Britain's foreign trade deficit. According to statistics in the British press, the foreign trade deficit for the first nine months of this year reached more than 677 million pounds, an increase of more than 58 percent over the same period last year. Britain's position in the fierce competition in the capitalist world market is weakening. The severity of Britain's export trade can be seen from the figures on world exports of means of production published by the British Machine Tool Trades Association in July this year. Between 1952 and 1954, West Germany's exports of means of production increased by 28.9 percent, the United States by 0.6 percent, and Britain decreased by 2.3 percent. On the other hand, Britain's imports are constantly increasing. Imports in June increased by 3 percent compared with the average figure for April and May; imports in the first half of this year increased by 14 percent compared with the same period last year.

　　The vast majority of Britain's food and industrial raw materials rely on imports from other countries, and an average of about 40 percent of the industrial products it produces each year rely on exports. Therefore, this deterioration in foreign trade is very serious for Britain.

　　What are the reasons for Britain's economic situation being in this situation? Many British newspapers pointed out that the policy of expanding armaments puts "an extremely heavy burden" on the British economy and has a detrimental impact. This view is quite correct.

　　For several years, Britain has maintained huge military expenditures. According to official figures, Britain's military expenditure in the 1954-55 fiscal year exceeded 1.7 billion pounds, accounting for 39 percent of total national expenditure. The 1955-56 fiscal year will roughly maintain this level. Huge military expenditures have increased the tax burden on the people, causing price increases and inflation. Among the major capitalist countries, Britain currently has the most serious inflation. From 1949 to 1954, retail prices in Britain rose by 30 percent. Since the beginning of this year, the rise in prices in Britain has been particularly rapid. From December last year to July this year, the price of major industrial raw materials rose by 7.3 percent; at the end of July, the price of coal rose by 18 percent; other items related to people's lives also increased in price. This situation is not only a serious threat to the lives of the British people, but also creates difficulties for Britain in competing in foreign markets.

　　The difficulties of the British economy have been aggravated by the one-sided development of military and military-related industries. Military production in Britain accounted for 17 percent of total industrial output in 1954. The ever-expanding military production has swallowed up a considerable portion of imported raw materials, and the import of these raw materials is neither for consumption, nor can most of them be offset by exports. Especially since the beginning of this year, when the price of imported raw materials has risen and the price of exported goods has not been able to increase accordingly, its harmfulness to the British economy has become even more serious. British Chancellor of the Exchequer Butler also said at a meeting of the British National Production Advisory Council in February this year that because the price of imports in January this year rose by 6 percent compared with a year ago, it will increase Britain's annual import costs by nearly 200 million pounds. This is naturally a considerable burden on Britain's international balance of payments.

　　Since the war, Britain has lagged behind other major capitalist countries in increasing fixed investment and improving industrial equipment. Taking the situation in 1953 as an example, the proportion of fixed capital investment in total national product was 16.1 percent in the United States, 27.7 percent in West Germany, and only 11.5 percent in Britain. At the same time, increased fixed capital investment has been concentrated in military and military-related industrial sectors, so that some of Britain's important basic industries and civilian industries cannot obtain the necessary funds to improve production equipment. This cannot but make these industries stagnate or shrink, and be excluded or be at a very disadvantageous position in the competition in overseas markets and domestic markets. Before the war, Britain exported 50 million tons of coal every year, but due to the shrinking of production, not only has it stopped exporting, but it is estimated that it will also import 12 million tons of coal from abroad this year. The decline of the textile industry is even more serious. According to materials published by the British "Economist" magazine, Britain's exports of cotton fabrics in 1954 had fallen to the lowest level since 1947. And the situation this year, according to a reporter from the "Financial Times", cotton fabric exports have fallen by 82 percent compared with last year, while textile imports have increased by 70 percent. The situation in the shipbuilding industry is also not good. The total tonnage of shipbuilding orders in the first quarter of this year fell to 18 percent; in April, the total amount of orders was 40 percent less than in 1952. Due to this situation, Britain has fallen behind West Germany in terms of ship exports.

　　Due to the development of military and military-related industries, Britain's total industrial output has maintained a slight increase in recent years. However, this superficial military "prosperity" phenomenon is becoming increasingly unsustainable. According to materials published in the August 4th supplement of the British "Manchester Guardian," Britain's industrial production index in June had fallen from 137 in May to 135 (with 1948 as 100). This is naturally a very ominous sign for the increasingly difficult British economy.

　　On the one hand, Britain is encountering increasing difficulties in the capitalist world market, and on the other hand, according to British Member of Parliament Ellis Smith, Britain is making its "trade interests subordinate to American military decisions" and implementing a so-called embargo policy on the markets of socialist camp countries. Because of this, a three-year order contract of 400 million pounds offered by the Soviet Union to Britain was not fulfilled. Between 1952 and 1954, Britain's exports to the Soviet Union did not exceed 16 million pounds. British trade with China has also been subjected to the same restrictions. In 1953, the proportion of Britain's exports to China in its total exports was only equivalent to one-quarter of that in 1938. This situation cannot but bring great damage to the British economy and aggravate its economic difficulties.

　　It should also be pointed out that the deterioration of the British economic situation is occurring at a time when sales conditions in the capitalist world market are becoming more difficult. In this regard, the obvious signs are that some capitalist countries have adopted measures to restrict imports or increase tariffs. Under the current conditions, especially when continuing to expand armaments and implementing a blockade and embargo policy on the markets of socialist camp countries, attempting to solve Britain's economic difficulties is obviously hopeless.

　　In this situation, British public opinion has recently advocated reducing military expenditures to alleviate the economic difficulties suffered by Britain. The "Daily Express," "Daily Telegraph and Morning Post" and "Daily Herald" have all published editorials calling for cuts in military spending. Many other newspapers have also called for reducing the number of armed forces and shortening the term of military service. These views reflect the urgent desire of a wide range of people in Britain.

　　But how does the British government authority treat this issue? Judging from the measures repeatedly announced by the British government since February this year, its basic policy is to reduce domestic consumption and substantially increase taxes in order to depress the living standards of the British people, especially the broad masses of working people, in order to make up for its financial and economic difficulties. The British government's approach is clearly reflected in its recent autumn budget. The budget stipulates that the purchase tax will be increased by 20 percent, and purchase tax will be levied on some household goods and textiles that were originally not taxed; the budget also requires further restrictions on credit, increased telephone and postal charges, reduced housing construction subsidies, and restrictions on investment in state-owned enterprises, public works and hospitals. According to statistics, merely increasing and newly levying purchase tax will increase the burden on the broad masses of the British people by 75 million pounds a year. Therefore, it is no wonder that the British public accuses this budget of being a budget that "attacks the kitchen." Obviously, the British government's approach will not only fail to improve Britain's economic situation, but will make it even worse.

　　Britain's current economic difficulties are a direct result of the "Cold War" policy. Only by abandoning the policy of expanding armaments and the "Cold War" can Britain's economic situation be improved. Only in this way can Britain turn to constructively developing its own economy, turn to developing trade with the world, especially expanding trade with the countries of the socialist camp, so as to improve Britain's economic situation.

　　英国经济的困难和“冷战”政策
　　高集
    英国的经济情况自从去年下半年以来即逐渐恶化，到目前为止这种趋势已经继续了一年多，并且情况是愈来愈为严重。
    英国经济情况恶化的一个重要标志，是黄金美元储备的不断减少。英国的黄金美元储备在一九五四年七月底止是三十亿一千三百万美元，但是到今年九月底止已跌落到二十三亿四千五百万美元。在减少的数字中，有半数以上是由于今年七、八、九三个月的亏损造成的。目前英国黄金美元的储备远低于一九五一年工党政府下台时的水平，而那个水平当时已被保守党称为是“招致危机的水平”。由此可见，在目前的情况下，英国的经济情况是如何地紧张了。
    造成这种紧张情况的一个原因，是英国对外贸易逆差的急剧增长。据英国报刊的统计，今年头九个月的对外贸易逆差达六亿七千七百多万英镑，比去年同期增加了百分之五十八以上。英国在资本主义世界市场上的激烈竞争中的地位日益削弱。从今年七月英国机器制造协会公布的关于世界生产资料出口的数字，可以看出英国出口贸易所处的严重情况。在一九五二至一九五四这三年间，西德生产资料的输出增长了百分之二十八点九，美国增长了百分之零点六，而英国则下降了百分之二点三。另一方面，英国的进口却在不断增加。今年六月比四、五两个月的平均数字增加了百分之三；今年上半年的进口比去年同期增加了百分之十四。
    英国绝大部分的粮食和工业原料是依靠自其他国家的进口，而它所生产的工业品每年平均约百分之四十是依靠出口的。所以，对外贸易的这种恶化情况对于英国来说是很严重的。
    究竟是什么原因使英国的经济情况陷于这种境地呢？英国许多报纸指出扩充军备的政策使英国经济承受着“一个极其沉重的负担”，起着有害的影响。这种意见是十分正确的。
    若干年来，英国一直维持着庞大的军事费用。据官方数字，英国一九五四—五五财政年度的军事开支超出十七亿英镑，占整个国家支出的百分之三十九。一九五五—五六年度大致也将维持在这样的水平上。庞大的军事开支加重了人民的捐税负担，引起物价上涨和通货膨胀。在主要的资本主义国家中，目前英国的通货膨胀是最严重的。从一九四九到一九五四年，英国零售价格上涨了百分之三十。今年以来，英国物价的上涨尤为猛烈。从去年十二月到今年七月，主要工业原料的价格上涨了百分之七点三；在七月底煤价上涨了百分之十八；其他和人民生活有关的物品也莫不涨价。这种情形不但对于英国人民的生活是一个严重的威胁，并且也造成了英国在国外市场上竞争的困难。
    由于片面地发展军事和与军事生产有关的工业，加剧了英国经济的困难。英国的军事生产在一九五四年已占全部工业产量的百分之十七。日益扩大的军事生产吞没了相当大一部分的进口原料，而这些原料的输入既不是为了消费，而且其中绝大部分也不能以出口来抵偿。特别是在今年以来进口原料价格上涨而出口货价格却不能相应提高的情况下，其对于英国经济的有害性就尤为厉害了。英国财政大臣巴特勒今年二月在英国全国生产咨议委员会的一次会议上也说过，由于今年一月进口价格比一年前上涨了百分之六，就将使英国每年用于进口的费用增加几乎两亿英镑。这对于英国的国际收支自然是一个不小的负担。
    战后以来，英国在增加固定投资、改善工业设备方面一直落后于其他主要资本主义国家。以一九五三年的情形来说，美国固定资本的投资在全国总产品中所占的比重为百分之十六点一，西德为百分之二十七点七，而英国则只有百分之十一点五。同时，增加的固定资本投资又都集中在军事和与军事生产有关的工业部门，从而使英国的一些重要的基本工业和民用工业得不到必要的资金来改善生产设备。这样就不能不使这些工业陷于停滞或萎缩状态，而在海外市场和国内市场的竞争中受到排斥或者处于十分不利的地位。英国战前每年要输出五千万吨煤，但是由于生产的萎缩，不但已停止输出，而且据估计今年还要从国外输入一千二百万吨煤。纺织业衰落的情况更为严重。据英国“经济学家”杂志发表的材料，英国一九五四年棉织品的出口已下降到一九四七年以来的最低水平。而今年的情况，据
  “金融时报”记者的报道，棉织品的出口和去年比较又下降了百分之八十二，而同时纺织品的入口却增加了百分之七十。造船业的情况也同样的不妙。今年第一季度造船订货的总吨数下降到百分之十八；四月间，订货的总量要比一九五二年减少百分之四十。由于这种情况，英国在船只出口方面已落后于西德。
    由于军事和与军事生产有关的工业的发展，近几年来，英国的工业生产总额曾一直保持着些微的上涨。但是，这种表面的军事“繁荣”现象也愈来愈不能保持了。据今年八月四日英国“曼彻斯特卫报”星期增刊所发表的材料，英国的工业生产指数，在今年六月已由五月的一三七跌落到一三五
  （以一九四八年为一百）。这对于日益陷于困难的英国经济自然是一个十分不祥的兆头。
    一方面英国在资本主义世界市场上遭遇到日益增长的困难，另一方面按照英国下议院议员埃利斯·史密斯的说法，英国又使自己的“贸易利益服从于美国的军事决定”，而对社会主义阵营国家的市场执行所谓禁运的政策。由于这种缘故，苏联曾经向英国提出的三年之间达四亿英镑的订货合同未被执行。在一九五二—五四年间，英国对苏联的出口不超过一千六百万英镑。英国对于中国贸易也受到了同样的限制。在一九五三年，英国对中国的出口额占其出口总额的比重，只相当于一九三八年的四分之一。这种情况不能不给英国经济带来极大的损害，加重了它的经济困难。
    还应当指出，英国经济情况的恶化，是发生在资本主义世界市场的销售条件更加困难的时候。在这方面明显的标志是一些资本主义国家采取了限制入口或者提高关税的措施。在目前的条件下，特别是还在继续进行扩充军备和对社会主义阵营国家的市场实行封锁禁运政策的情况下，企图解决英国的经济困难，显然是没有出路的。
    在这种情况下，英国公众舆论近来纷纷主张缩减军费开支来缓和英国所遭受到的经济困难。“每日快报”、“每日电讯与晨邮报”和“每日先驱报”都曾发表社论要求缩减军费开支。其他许多报纸并要求裁减武装部队人数和缩短兵役期限。这些意见反映了英国广泛阶层人士的迫切愿望。
    但是，英国政府当局怎样来对待这个问题呢？从今年二月以来英国政府屡次宣布的措施看来，它的基本方针是减少国内消费，大量增加税收，以压低英国人民，特别是广大劳动人民的生活水平，来弥补它的财政经济的困难。英国政府的这种做法，明显地表现在它最近提出的秋季预算上。这个预算规定把购买税提高百分之二十，并对一些原不抽税的家庭用品和纺织品征收购买税；这个预算还要求进一步限制信贷，增加电话费和邮费，减少房屋建筑津贴，限制对国营企业、公共工程和医院等方面的投资等。据统计，仅提高和新征购买税即将使英国广大人民一年内增加七千五百万英镑的负担。因此，难怪英国公众指责这个预算是“向厨房进攻”的预算。显然，英国政府的这种做法不但不能改善英国的经济情况，反而会使它更加恶化。
    英国经济目前的困难，是“冷战”政策的直接结果。只有放弃扩充军备和“冷战”政策，英国的经济情况才能够有所改善。只有这样，才能使英国转向建设性地发展本国经济，转向同全世界发展贸易，特别是扩大同社会主义阵营国家的贸易，从而改善英国的经济情况。
