The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League convened the 1955 Beijing Municipal Conference of Active Elements in Production Internships for University Students on October 30th.  Approximately 600 teachers and student representatives from universities in Beijing attended the conference.  This conference called on university students to emulate the active elements, learn from the active elements in production internships, and strive to become new-style intellectual laborers with high political and ideological consciousness, mastery of science and technology, love for the working people, and dedicated hard work for the cause of socialist construction.

At the conference, twenty-nine internship students, four internship groups, and two internship teams received material rewards from the Municipal Committee of the Youth League.  They also introduced their production internship experiences at the meeting.  The internship group from the Trade Economics Department of Renmin University of China, during their internship in Fanzhen Township, Tai'an County, Shandong Province, correctly implemented the state's policy of unified purchase and sale, overfulfilling the wheat unified purchase task by 20,000 jin, and helped farmers fight drought and replant seedlings, which was warmly welcomed by the farmers.  The student internship groups from the Department of Metallurgy of the Beijing Iron and Steel Institute and the Department of Mining Construction of the Beijing Mining College put forward many rationalization proposals during their internships, solving important problems such as improving the quality of sintered ore.  The Beijing Hardware and Materials Factory, due to adopting the suggestions of the internship students from the Department of Hygiene of the Beijing Medical College, improved the factory's labor hygiene equipment.

Among the twenty-nine internship students who were rewarded at the conference, there was Kuang Tingyun, a student from the Department of Soil Agrochemistry of Beijing Agricultural University, who led the entire group to complete the surveying of 1,600 hectares of wasteland every day in the desolate and uninhabited Great Northern Wilderness; Zhang Meini, a student from the Chinese Department of Beijing Normal University, who revised the teaching materials seven or eight times during her educational internship and patiently taught the students; Tang Xiuyi, a student from Beijing Geological College who received a reward, boldly applied the advanced experience of the Soviet "sedimentary cycle comparison method" in exploration design during his internship in a certain mining area in Inner Mongolia, which greatly shortened the exploration time and saved the country 200,000 yuan in investment.

At the conference, Hu Yaobang, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, and Yang Xiufeng, Minister of Higher Education, delivered speeches, encouraging everyone to work actively and contribute to the socialist construction of the motherland. Yang Shu, Director of the Propaganda Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, gave a current affairs report at the meeting. After the meeting, the students performed songs, dances, and other literary and artistic programs they created during their production internships. (Xinhua News Agency)
