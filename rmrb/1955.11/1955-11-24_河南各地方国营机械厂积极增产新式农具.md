　　Henan Local State-Owned Machinery Plants Actively Increase Production of New Agricultural Implements

　　Workers in Henan Province's local state-owned machinery plants are actively increasing production of various new agricultural implements. Since launching the labor competition of "completing the annual plan forty days ahead of schedule," the production efficiency of workers at the Kaifeng Machinery Plant has greatly improved. With the close cooperation of other workshops, the assembly workshop broke through the daily quota of twenty-two units, reaching a daily output of three hundred units. By November 20th, it will have overfulfilled the plan to produce 46,300 double-shared plows annually. They have already decided to increase production by another 10,000 double-shared plows before the end of the year, while also preparing for the production of 130,000 double-shared plows next year. The workers at the Anyang Machinery Plant used their brains to find clever ways to improve tools. Using a punch press to punch holes in the wheel rims, a part of the double-shared plow, accelerated the process four times compared to using a drilling machine in the past. Therefore, in addition to completing this year's plan to manufacture double-shared plows, they will also increase production of 1,400 Liberation-style waterwheels in the last month of the year. The workers at the Jiaozuo Machinery Plant, in the labor competition of "improving quality, increasing production, and practicing economy," also comprehensively completed the waterwheel production task for the third quarter, and on this basis, proposed a guarantee to complete the plan one month ahead of schedule. The Zhengzhou Machinery Plant, which originally only repaired various types of tractors, has also decided to add a new product next year to help agricultural production cooperatives with irrigated land carry out production. After receiving the glorious task of producing 45,000 complete sets of waterwheels (accounting for more than one-third of the province's waterwheel production) and 78,000 waterwheel chains for the province next year, all the workers at the Xinxiang Machinery Plant immediately mobilized, accelerated the completion of this year's waterwheel production plan, and planned to adjust the labor organization, organize assembly line operations for mass production, and establish waterwheel process regulations, thereby fully preparing for next year's production.

　　河南各地方国营机械厂积极增产新式农具
　　河南省各地方国营机械厂职工积极增产各种新式农具。开封机械厂自从展开“提前四十天完成全年计划”的劳动竞赛后，工人们生产效率大为提高，装配车间在其他各车间的密切配合下，突破了每日装二十二台的定额，达到日产三百台。到十一月二十日即可超额完成年产四万六千三百部双铧犁的计划。他们已经确定在年底以前再增产一万台双铧犁，同时为明年生产十三万台双铧犁做好准备。安阳机械厂的职工动脑筋、找窍门，改进了工具，使用冲床在双铧犁零件——轮啳上冲眼，比过去用钻车打眼加速了四倍进度，因此他们除了能完成今年制造双铧犁的计划外，年末的一月还要增产一千四百部解放式水车。焦作机械厂的职工们，也在“提高质量、增产节约”的劳动竞赛中，全面完成了第三季度的水车生产任务，并且在这个基础上提出了提前一个月完成计划的保证。原来只是承修各式拖拉机的郑州机械厂，也决定明年增添一种新的产品，帮助有水浇地的农业生产合作社进行生产。新乡机械厂在接受了明年为全省生产四万五千部全套水车（占全省水车生产量的三分之一强），和七万八千部水车链子的光荣任务后，全体职工立即动员起来，加速完成今年水车生产计划，且拟调整劳动组织，组织大批生产的流水作业，建立水车工艺规程，从而充分地作好明年生产准备。　（本报驻郑州记者）
