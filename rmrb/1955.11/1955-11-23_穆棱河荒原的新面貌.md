　　New Look of the Muling River Wilderness

　　In the Hulin area of Heilongjiang Province, there is a boundless prairie. This fertile, semi-swampy land is a corner of the Muling River Wilderness. The natural conditions here, such as soil, rainfall, and water sources, are very suitable for the growth of soybeans, wheat, corn, and rice.

　　In October 1954, a unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army came here. After the entire winter of preparation, a farm was established this spring, and large-scale land reclamation work began. Starting in May, they built the farm, reclaimed land, and sowed seeds simultaneously. By the end of October, they had reclaimed 10,000 hectares of wasteland. They planted more than 2,000 hectares of soybeans, more than 100 hectares of rice, and more than 150 hectares of wheat and vegetables. After half a year of hard work, the farm achieved high yields over large areas this year. The average soybean yield was more than 2,400 jin per hectare, exceeding the highest yield of local agricultural production cooperatives by more than 40 jin; the average rice yield was 8,000 jin per hectare, exceeding the planned yield of 6,000 jin by more than 33 percent. Local farmers said, "This is a rare phenomenon in the first year of land reclamation."

　　This spring and summer, there was continuous rainfall. In order to save time for weeding and sowing, the soldiers persisted in working in the fields regardless of the rain. The staff surveying the wilderness had to wade through swamps with grass as high as their chests and water as deep as their knees every day. Sometimes, they would accidentally get lost and lose their way. But they were not discouraged. Sometimes, across the Ussuri River, they looked at our great neighbor, the Soviet Union, and the bright socialist future inspired them. This is how they overcame difficulties and achieved a victorious harvest.

　　In order to increase grain production to support national construction, the farm's sowing area will be expanded to 15,000 hectares next year, and it is planned to reclaim another 100,000 hectares. At present, large numbers of tractors and combine harvesters are being shipped in to create conditions for large-scale production and land reclamation next spring.

　　穆棱河荒原的新面貌
　　高绪澎
    在黑龙江省虎林一带，有着一望无际的大草原。这块肥美的半沼泽地，便是穆棱河荒原的一角。这里的土壤、雨量、水源等自然条件，很适宜于大豆、小麦、玉米和水稻的生长。
    一九五四年十月，中国人民解放军某部来到这里，经过整个冬天的准备工作，今春成立了农场，开始了大规模的垦荒工作。他们从五月份开始，边建场、边开荒、边播种，到十月底已开垦荒地一万公顷。共种植了大豆二千多公顷，水稻一百多公顷，小麦、蔬菜等一百五十多公顷。经过半年来的努力，今年农场获得了大面积的高额产量。大豆平均每公顷产二千四百多斤，比当地农业生产合作社最高产量超过四十斤；水稻平均每公顷产八千斤，超过计划产量六千斤百分之三十三强。当地农民说：“这是开荒头一年少有的现象。”
    今年春、夏季，雨水连绵，为了争取时间及时除草播种，战士们不顾雨淋，在田里坚持工作。勘察荒地的工作人员，每天要在野草齐胸、水深过膝的沼泽地上跋涉，有时一不小心便会掉队迷失方向。可是他们并不气馁，有时隔着乌苏里江，远眺着我们伟大的邻邦——苏联，社会主义的美好将来鼓舞着他们。他们便是这样克服困难，获得了丰收的胜利。
    为了增产粮食支援国家建设，农场明年的播种面积将扩展到一万五千公顷，并计划再开荒十万公顷。目前，大批的拖拉机、联合收割机正在源源地运来，为明春大规模生产和开荒创造条件。
