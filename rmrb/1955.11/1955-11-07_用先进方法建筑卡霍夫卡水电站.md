    Building the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Station with Advanced Methods
    S. Andrianov, Chief of the Dnepr Construction Project of the Soviet Union
    The Soviet people are smoothly realizing the grand program of national electrification formulated by the Communist Party. Dozens of huge hydraulic hubs are being built on the Volga, Angara, Dnieper, Ob, and Irtysh rivers. Recently, the installed units of the Kama Hydroelectric Station, Narva Hydroelectric Station, and other hydroelectric stations have begun generating electricity one after another. The Kakhovka Hydraulic Hub is being put into operation – navigation through the locks has begun, and the first unit of the hydroelectric station has already generated industrial electricity.
    Building the second power center on the Dnieper River – the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Station – makes it possible to comprehensively solve a number of national economic tasks. The nearly 1.4 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity generated by the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Station will be fed into the Dnieper-Donbass-Rostov power system, ensuring the further development of a large number of industrial and agricultural sectors of our country. A large number of irrigation canals are being dug from the Kakhovka Reservoir to the southern Ukrainian states, which will help improve the fertility of the vast grasslands that are often subject to drought. This hydraulic hub will also help establish the shortest railway transport line between the coal-producing Donbass and the iron ore-producing Krivoy Rog, and improve navigation on the lower reaches of the Dnieper River.
    All the employees of the Dnepr Construction Project, which has been awarded honors, have been engaged in the construction of the Kakhovka Hydraulic Hub for more than five years. We started working on the desolate banks of the Dnieper River, on the reedy river beaches of the Dnieper. Today, huge permanent structures of completed navigation locks, hydroelectric stations, and dams have been erected on the river. New Kakhovka – a beautiful and well-equipped city – is located on the river bank. Concrete factories, woodworking factories, mechanical factories, and other auxiliary factories have now been established here, without which the construction of modern hydraulic engineering would be inconceivable. More than 200 kilometers of railway lines and 150 kilometers of motor roads have been laid in the construction area. The city and the district centers around the construction site have been transformed beyond recognition.
    Under the slogan "Let the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Station generate electricity one year ahead of the government's schedule – in 1955!", the employees of the Dnepr Engineering Bureau launched a competition with the construction personnel of the Angara Hydroelectric Station and the Gorky Hydroelectric Station. In the process of the socialist competition, the construction personnel of the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Station, under the leadership of the Party organization, completed a large amount of work. 1.25 million cubic meters of concrete have been poured on the main buildings, more than 120,000 tons of metal structures and reinforcing steel have been installed, and 30,000 tons of steel sheet piles have been driven. The first phase of the project has been completed, which indicates a high level of construction preparation for the main buildings. The cofferdams have been successfully drained, and the intense work of impounding water into the reservoir has begun. The riverbed was closed off not in the ten days stipulated in the plan, but in a record-breaking short time – 48 hours. The dam has risen ten meters above the river surface.
    The employees of the Dnepr Construction Engineering Bureau are completing all the construction and installation work and putting all the buildings of this hydraulic hub into production more than a year ahead of schedule. If we also take into account that the Kakhovka Hydraulic Hub is being built on complex geological conditions – a fine sand foundation – then it becomes even more obvious the power of the creative enthusiasm of the construction personnel.
    This high construction speed is possible, first of all, because the project has received the support of the whole people. Enterprises in 300 cities in our country have completed orders for us. In this collective of thousands of people, representatives of twenty-two nationalities are working like in a fraternal family. Dozens of scientific research institutions and design organizations are solving complex hydraulic engineering problems with us.
    The construction site is equipped with powerful modern machinery and equipment. The enterprises of heavy industry have equipped us with first-class machines and machinery. The average production equipment level per construction worker has reached nearly fifteen horsepower. In the construction project of the Dnepr Hydroelectric Station named after "Lenin", the excavation and earth transportation work was carried out by thousands of earthworkers. However, when building the Kakhovka Hydraulic Hub, powerful dredgers, excavators, bulldozers, and scrapers have replaced the heavy labor of earthworkers. The drivers on the ten electric dredgers removed nearly 30 million cubic meters of soil at the main buildings. Machines have also been used to replace human labor in strenuous tasks such as tamping concrete and installing steel bars.
    The abundant machinery and equipment and the high level of power equipment enable the implementation of extensive mechanization of various operation processes and the construction using advanced industrial methods. The mechanization level of the main operations has reached a very high degree. We have fully mechanized the mixing, transportation, and pouring of concrete into the pouring sections. The installation of metal structures has been 98 percent mechanized. The installation of reinforcing steel and earthwork have been 95 percent mechanized. The use of machinery not only reduces the labor of workers but also promotes the continuous improvement of labor productivity. The fact that two-thirds of our employees can complete more than two quotas every day is the most eloquent proof of this. There is no construction worker here who cannot complete the shift task.
    The widespread adoption of the experience accumulated by Soviet hydraulic construction personnel in production and the adoption of all new and advanced working methods in construction are important factors in improving construction speed. The innovators of the construction site, relying on powerful machinery and equipment, bravely and resolutely adopt such new methods as driving steel sheet piles with high-frequency vibrators, installing reinforced concrete shell panels to replace wooden formwork, and so on, as tireless fighters for technological progress. Technological innovation has had a positive impact on shortening the construction period and reducing construction and installation costs.
    The construction personnel of the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Station, in cooperation with all the personnel of the scientific research institutions in Moscow, Leningrad, Tbilisi, and Kiev, have successfully adopted the large-scale pouring section concrete pouring method. Previously, the volume of the pouring section never exceeded 1,000 cubic meters. In the construction project of the overflow dam, the concrete worker group of Communist Party member Seraphim Nikulin first poured concrete with a volume of up to 8,000 cubic meters into the pouring section. After believing in the great effect of this method, all concrete workers have effectively adopted this method. The large-scale concrete pouring method shortens the preparation time of the pouring section, improves the quality of the project, and increases the labor productivity of concrete workers by one to two times. We are widely using prefabricated reinforced concrete in the construction of the overpass bridge on the overflow dam, the construction of all pipeline trenches, the roof of the power plant building, and other projects.
    Our installation worker innovators have greatly saved time and money. They must personally install tens of thousands of tons of metal structures and hydraulic power equipment. Usually, the installation work is always carried out in several successive stages. Our engineering and technical personnel decided to abolish this sequential system and implement a parallel installation operation system for steel bars and equipment. To this end, a detailed comprehensive operation instruction chart has been formulated, which stipulates the maximum workload of installers, reinforcing steel workers, and general construction personnel during each shift. The use of this comprehensive operation instruction chart in the construction of the power plant building has enabled us to advance the start-up time of the first unit of the hydroelectric station by more than a year. The comprehensive operation instruction chart ensures a more precise labor organization, a high production efficiency of installers, and a large saving of time and money.
    The installers also adopted a new method of assembling and installing steel bars. Previously, steel bar structures were installed directly in the pouring section, but now, large steel bar trusses and bundles weighing up to ten tons are prefabricated in the steel bar factory, and then transported to the installation site by railway flatcars or special vehicles. This method speeds up the installation of steel bars by two to three times.
    The installers of hydraulic units, following the example of the reinforcing steel workers, adopted the large-component combined installation method. They first assemble the various parts of the water turbine and generator on the assembly yard, and then use bridge cranes to lift them to the installation site. Under the initiative of our engineers Belogorov, Masichev, Kiselev, and other comrades, the employees of the Kharkov Turbine Manufacturing Plant helped the construction personnel to adopt the large-component combined rapid installation method of the unit. They transported the assembled turbine without blades from Kharkov to the assembly yard. After unloading the turbine in Kakhovka, there were only two processes left on the assembly yard: installing the blades and conducting hydraulic tests. The adoption of this suggestion shortens the time for installing each water turbine by at least fifteen days.
    The Party, trade union, Communist Youth League organizations, and engineering and technical personnel of the construction site are working hard every day to promote the development of creative suggestions related to the full utilization of internal potential. The construction personnel are tirelessly searching for new working methods and new ways to increase workload. The achievements of their creative exploration are particularly evident in various rationalization proposals. In the past five years, our rationalization proposers and inventors have put forward nearly two thousand suggestions. The adoption of these suggestions alone has conditionally saved the construction site more than eight million rubles a year.
    Electric welder Alexander Kiselev developed and used a new method of welding steel bars. Usually, backing bars are required to weld two reinforcing bars. However, he suggested welding by butt jointing without using backing bars. This method ensures high work quality and can save 8-12 kilograms of metal for each weld. Our engineers and electric welders have comprehensively studied the innovator's new method. The scientific staff of the Paton Welding Institute has suggested that the electric welder Kiselev's method be widely adopted.
    Fitter Peter Gilyok, bulldozer operator Ivan Mascherov, motor installation worker Tamara Zhida, dredger operator Mikhail Seroyegin, and many others have put forward many valuable suggestions. The research work that has been launched on a large scale plays a significant role in promoting the creative thinking of construction personnel. Two experimental open-air prefabrication plants have been established on the construction site, studying concrete pouring methods, dynamic performance of soil, and so on. The scientific and technical committee of the construction site guides the employees to solve some new and important problems with creative ideas. This committee discusses urgent technical problems related to work speed and quality with advanced producers every month.
    We have established all the conditions for creatively improving and enriching the knowledge of construction personnel. The city's branch of the Hydraulic Engineering Institute and the Hydraulic Engineering Secondary Technical School, as well as the Secondary Night School, have opened various courses. Nearly 8,600 people have attended classes in joint schools in recent years. Many of them have obtained two or three specialized knowledge and are now constantly improving their skills.
    The personnel of design institutions and scientific research institutions are working tirelessly with construction personnel to strive for the early power generation of the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Station. In studying the original data and technical documents of the Kakhovka Hydraulic Hub, they found that putting the sixth unit into operation can increase the previously designed capacity of the hydroelectric power station by one-fifth. They have also put forward many valuable suggestions in the layout of the hydroelectric power station plant and the selection of the summary coil and equipment of the electromechanical section.
    Experts from people's democratic countries and other foreign guests often visit the Kakhovka Hydraulic Hub construction site. Recently, experts from India, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and other countries have come to visit us. We show them everything that the visiting delegations are interested in and try our best to tell them about our experience in hydraulic engineering.
    Our construction personnel felt particularly happy when the representatives of the great Chinese people came here. Chinese university students who are studying at universities in Moscow, Leningrad, and other cities come to Kakhovka for internships every year. This summer, many Chinese university students came here. They worked on the overflow dam and hydroelectric power station plant buildings and other work sections. They showed everywhere a high degree of desire for knowledge, for mastering the working methods and methods of our engineers, technicians, foremen, and construction workers.
    The Kakhovka Hydroelectric Station has begun to generate kinetic energy for the needs of our national economy. But there is still a lot of work to be done in front of us. Five more units must be installed and send electricity, the Kakhovka Sea must be impounded to make its water surface reach the designed height, and decoration and architectural work must be completed on all buildings, and so on. The employees of the Dnepr Construction Engineering Bureau, under the leadership of the Party organization, are increasingly expanding the competition to strive to complete the construction of this hydraulic hub completely in the first half of 1956, and ensure that its excellent quality is handed over to the government's acceptance committee. On the new construction site of the socialist motherland – the fortress of world peace and security – we will utilize and increase the experience accumulated by our collective, which has been awarded honors, in building the two hydroelectric stations on the Dnepr River.

    用先进方法建筑卡霍夫卡水电站
    苏联第聂伯河建筑工程处处长  斯·安德里雅诺夫
    苏联人民正在顺利实现着共产党所制定的全国电气化的宏伟纲领。在伏尔加河、安加拉河、第聂伯河、鄂毕河、额尔齐斯河上正在建筑着几十个巨大的水利枢纽。最近时期，卡马水电站、纳尔瓦水电站和其他水电站的已装好的机组已经一个接一个的开始发电。卡霍夫卡水利枢纽正在投入运行——水闸的通航已经开始，水电站的第一部机组已经发出工业用电。
    在第聂伯河上建筑第二个动力中心——卡霍夫卡水电站，使得能够综合地解决一些国民经济的任务。卡霍夫卡水电站所发的近十四亿瓩时的电能将输入第聂伯—顿巴斯—罗斯托夫动力系统，并保证我们祖国的大量工业和农业部门获得进一步发展。从卡霍夫卡水库正在向南乌克兰各州开凿大量的灌溉渠，这些水渠将有助于提高经常遭受干旱的最富足的广阔草原地的肥沃性。这个水利枢纽也将有助于在产煤的顿巴斯和产铁矿的克里沃·罗格之间建立最短的铁路运输线，并改进第聂伯河下游的航运。
    获得勋章的第聂伯河建筑工程处的全体员工从事卡霍夫卡水利枢纽的建筑已有五年多了。我们是在第聂伯河的荒凉的两岸，在第聂伯河的芦苇丛生的河滩地上开始工作的。今天在河面上已耸立起已建成的通航水闸、水电站和拦河坝的巨大永久性建筑物。新卡霍夫卡——美丽的设备良好的城市，就位于河岸上。现在这里已建立了混凝土工厂、木工工厂、机械工厂和别的辅助工厂，没有这些工厂，建设现代化的水力工程就是不可思议的。在建筑工区已铺设了两百多公里的铁路线和一百五十公里的汽车路。城市和建设工地周围的各个区中心，已改造得辨认不出来了。
    在“让卡霍夫卡水电站比政府规定的期限提前一年——一九五五年发电！”的口号下，第聂伯河工程处的员工们同安加拉水电站和高尔基水电站的建筑人员们展开了竞赛。在社会主义竞赛的进程中，卡霍夫卡水电站的建筑人员们，在党组织的领导下，完成了大量的工作。在主要建筑物上已浇灌了一百二十五万公方的混凝土、安装了十二万吨以上的金属结构和钢筋、打设了三万吨的钢板桩。第一期的工程都已完成了，这表明对主要建筑物已有高度的施工准备。各个基坑已经顺利进行了放水，向水库蓄水的紧张工作已经开始。不是用计划所规定的十昼夜，而是在创纪录的短短时间——四十八小时内，完成了河床的截闭工作。拦河坝已高出河面达十公尺。
    第聂伯建筑工程处的员工们完成着所有的建筑安装工作，并使这个水利枢纽的所有建筑物都比规定期限提早一年多投入生产。如果同时还估计到卡霍夫卡水利枢纽是在复杂的地质条件——细砂地基上建造的，那末就更可以十分明显地看出建筑人员们的创造性热情的力量。
    这种高度的施工速度之所以成为可能，首先是由于这项工程获得了全民的支持。我国三百个城市的企业都为我们完成了订货。在数千人的这个集体中，二十二种民族的代表像在一个友爱家庭中的那样劳动着。几十个科学研究机关和设计机构同我们一道解决着复杂的水力工程问题。
    建筑工地装备有强大的现代化机器设备。重工业的各企业以头等的机器和机械装备了我们。每个建筑人员的平均生产装备程度达到了近十五马力。在以“列宁”命名的第聂伯水电站的建筑工程中，挖土和运土的工作曾是由数千名土方工人来进行。而在建筑卡霍夫卡水利枢纽时，强大的吸泥机、挖土机、推土机、铲土机已经代替了土方工人的繁重劳动。十个电动吸泥机上的驾驶人员们在主要建筑物处移走了近三千万公方的泥土。在捣固混凝土、安装钢筋等费力工作上，也已用机器代替了人的劳动。
    丰富的机器设备和高度的动力装备使得各种作业过程都能够实行广泛机械化，并用先进的工业方法进行施工。主要作业的机械化水平已达到非常高的程度。我们已把拌制、运输和向浇灌段内浇灌混凝土的工作，全部机械化了。金属结构的安装工作，已有百分之九十八机械化。钢筋的安装和土方工作已有百分之九十五机械化。机械的采用不仅减轻工人的劳动，而且也促进劳动生产率的不断提高。我们的三分之二的员工每天都能完成两个以上的定额这件事实，就最雄辩不过地证明了这点。我们这里已经没有哪个建筑人员会完不成每班任务的了。
    在生产中广泛采用苏联水工建筑人员所积累的经验，并在施工中采用一切新的和先进的工作方法，是提高施工速度的一个重要因素。建筑工地的革新者们，依靠着强大的机器设备，以争取技术进步的不倦战士的姿态，勇敢而坚决地采用了这样一类新的方法：用高频率的震动器来打设钢板桩，安装钢筋混凝土壳板以代替木模板，以及其他等等。技术的革新对于缩短工期和降低建筑安装成本都发生了良好的影响。
    卡霍夫卡水电站的建筑人员们在和莫斯科、列宁格勒、梯比里斯、基辅的科学研究机关的全体人员合作下，顺利地采用了大型浇灌段混凝土浇灌法。以前浇灌段的容积一向超不过一千公方。在溢流坝建筑工程中，共产党员绥拉菲姆·尼库林的混凝土工小组首先向浇灌段中浇灌了容积达八千公方的混凝土。在相信了这种方法的巨大效果以后，所有的混凝土工都有成效地采用了这个方法。大型混凝土浇灌法缩短了浇灌段的准备时间，提高了工程的质量，并把混凝土工的劳动生产率提高了一倍到两倍。在建造溢流坝上的通行桥，建筑所有的管道沟槽、发电厂房的屋顶和其他工程上，我们正在广泛利用着装配式钢筋混凝土。
      我们的安装工人革新者们大大地节约了时间和资金。他们必须亲手来安装数万吨的金属结构和水力发电设备。通常，安装工作总是分成几个先后阶段来进行。我们的工程技术人员们决定取消这种顺序制度而实行钢筋和设备的平行安装作业制度。为此，曾细密地制定了一种综合作业指示图表，其中规定了安装工、钢筋工和一般建筑人员在每班工作时间中最大限度的工作量。在发电厂房的施工中采用这种综合作业指示图表的结果，使我们把水电站第一台机组的开动时间提早了一年多。 综合作业指示图表保证了更精确的劳动组织、安装工的高度生产效率和时间与资金的大量节省。
    安装工也采用了装配和安设钢筋的新方法。以前钢筋结构是直接在浇灌段内安装，而现在是在钢筋工厂里先制成重达十吨的大型钢筋桁架和束架，然后用铁路平车或特备的汽车送往安装地点。这种方法使钢筋的安装速度加快了两倍至三倍。
    水力机组的安装工仿照钢筋工的例子，采用了大件组合安装方法。他们把水轮机和发电机的各个部件先在装配场上装好，然后再用桥式起重机吊往安装地点。在我们的工程师别洛哥罗夫、马西契夫、基西列夫等同志的倡议下，哈尔科夫轮机制造厂的员工们帮助施工人员们采用了机组的大件组合快速安装法。他们把没有轮叶的已装配好的涡轮从哈尔科夫运到装配场上。在卡霍夫卡把涡轮卸下以后，装配场上就只剩下了两道工序：安装轮叶和进行水力试验。这个建议的采用使得安装每个水轮机的时间缩短至少十五天。
    工地的党、工会、共青团组织和工程技术人员每天都在努力促进着有关充分利用内在潜力的创造性建议的发展。建筑人员们不倦地寻找新的劳动方法和提高工作量的新的途径。他们的创造性探索的成绩特别明显地反映在各种合理化建议中。五年来，我们的合理化建议者和发明者提出了近两千条建议。仅是采用这些建议就使工地一年有条件节约八百万以上卢布。
    电焊工阿历山大·基西列夫制定并使用了焊接钢筋的新方法。通常为了焊接两根筋条需要采用垫筋。可是他建议不采用垫筋而以对接缝法焊接。这个方法保证高度的工作质量并能使每次焊接节约八—十二公斤的金属。我们的工程师和电焊工全面地研究了这位革新者的新方法。帕托恩电焊研究所的科学工作人员对电焊工基西列夫的方法已建议加以广泛采用。
    钳工彼得·吉略克、推土机手伊凡·马斯契罗夫、电机安装女工塔玛拉·日达、挖泥机手米哈依尔·塞罗耶金和许多别的人都提出很多宝贵的建议。已经大规模展开的研究工作对于推动建筑人员的创造性思想起着重大的作用。在建筑工地上已建立了两座实验性的露天预制厂，研究着浇灌混凝土的方法、土壤的动力性能等等。工地的科学技术委员会指导着员工们以富于创造性的思想来解决一些新的重要问题。这个委员会每月都和先进生产者一道共同讨论那些关系着工作速度和质量的迫切性技术问题。
    我们已为创造性地提高和丰富建筑人员的知识建立了一切条件。市内水力工程学院分校和水力工程科中等技术学校以及中等夜校已开设了各种课程。近几年来在联合学校中上课的达八千六百人。他们中许多人已获得了两、三种专门知识，现在正在坚持不断地提高着自己的技能。
    设计机构和科学研究机关的人员们同建筑人员密切合作，正在为争取使卡霍夫卡水电站提前发电而不倦地工作着。在研究卡霍夫卡水利枢纽的原始资料和技术文件中，他们发现将第六部机组投入运转可以把水力发电站以前的设计容量增大五分之一。在布置水电站厂房以及选择机电部分的总结线圈和设备方面，他们也提出了很多宝贵建议。
    人民民主各国来的专家们和其他外国的贵宾们经常访问卡霍夫卡水利枢纽建筑工地。最近，印度、瑞典、英国和其他一些国家的专家们曾来我们这里参观。我们把来访问的代表团所感到兴趣的一切都指给他们看，并尽力把我们的水工建筑经验告诉他们。
    当伟大的中国人民的代表们来到这里的时候，我们建筑人员感到了特别的愉快。在莫斯科、列宁格勒和其他城市高等学校进修的中国大学生，每年都有人到卡霍夫卡实习。今年夏天，我们这里来了很多中国大学生。他们在溢流坝和水电站厂房的建筑物以及其他工段上工作。他们随处都表现了对知识、对掌握我们工程师、技师、工长、建筑工作人员的劳动方式和方法的高度渴望。
    卡霍夫卡水电站已开始为我国国民经济的需要发出动能。但是在我们面前还有很多工作要做。必须再安装五部机组并使它们发送电力，必须向卡霍夫卡海蓄水使它的水面达到设计的高度，必须在所有建筑物上完成修饰和建筑艺术工作以及其他等等。第聂伯河建筑工程处的员工们在党组织的领导下正日益广泛地展开竞赛，争取在一九五六年上半年全部完成这个水利枢纽的建筑，并保证其优良的质量交给政府的验收委员会。在社会主义祖国——全世界和平和安全的堡垒——的新建筑工地上，我们将利用并增大我们这个获得勋章的集体在建筑第聂伯河两个水电站中积累起来的经验。
