    Our foreign trade is an integral part of the national economy, tasked with promoting domestic production and improving people's lives. In old China, foreign trade was an important means for imperialist and bureaucratic-comprador bourgeoisie to exploit and devastate the Chinese economy. Imperialist countries cheaply obtained China's resources and dumped various luxury goods into China, severely打击打击China's national industries and促促使the bankruptcy of the rural economy. After liberation, our country implemented foreign trade controls and protectionist trade policies, fundamentally changing the colonial and semi-colonial nature of old China's foreign trade. On the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual assistance and cooperation, our country has developed trade with the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries. Through this new type of foreign trade, we have received tremendous help from various people's democratic countries, especially the Soviet Union, which has played an extremely important role in restoring our national economy and preparing for and implementing the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy. On the principle of equality and mutual benefit, our country has also restored or developed trade with Asian and African countries, especially Southeast Asian countries, and Western capitalist countries. This has also played a certain role in the recovery and development of the national economy.

    During the period of the first five-year plan for the development of our national economy, our foreign trade will have great development. It is estimated that the total value of our country's foreign trade in 1957 will increase by 66.5 percent compared with 1952.

    The primary task of our foreign trade is to serve the development of heavy industry. The 156 industrial construction units designed by the Soviet Union to help China are the center of our industrial construction. A considerable proportion of the materials imported by our country within five years is the equipment and important materials required by these units during this period. During the first five-year plan, Eastern European people's democratic countries also supplied our country with a considerable number of complete sets of factory equipment. The American imperialism's “embargo” policy against our country, and the attempt of certain capitalist countries to implement the American imperialism’s “embargo” policy, forcing China to rely on and depend on them again, this conspiracy has completely failed.

    In addition to complete sets of equipment, our country also imports various machinery and equipment and raw materials required for industry and transportation, such as large and precision machine tools, precision instruments, mining machinery, transportation machinery, hoisting machinery, vehicles, ships, various steel products, non-ferrous metals, electrical and telecommunications equipment, and chemical raw materials. The import of these equipments is of great significance for improving existing equipment, increasing productivity, improving product quality, and ensuring the completion of production plans. In addition, our country's raw materials for certain light industries cannot fully meet the needs. To this end, in the past few years, our country has imported a certain amount of cotton, rubber, flue-cured tobacco, jute, rayon fabrics, and wool tops for high-grade woolen fabrics; in the future, we will continue to import these industrial raw materials appropriately according to the needs of industrial production and agricultural harvest, in order to ensure industrial production and meet the needs of the people.

    During the first five-year plan, our foreign trade will also import some draught animals, agricultural machinery, improved seeds, pesticides, and a considerable amount of fertilizer to serve the development of agriculture and promote the cause of socialist transformation of agriculture.

    Over the years, the materials imported by our country have been dominated by means of production. In the total import value in 1954, the materials required for industrial and agricultural production and other construction accounted for 88.5 percent, of which the materials for manufacturing means of production occupied the main position. This shows that our country's foreign trade has always been implementing the principle of developing production, especially giving priority to the development of heavy industry. However, in order to meet the current urgent needs of the people, certain daily necessities such as sugar, cloth, paper, kerosene, medicine, and a small number of cultural and educational supplies are also imported, which plays a certain role in improving people's lives and stabilizing the market.

    The import policy of foreign trade is: on the one hand, to ensure the needs of national production and construction, and on the other hand, to protect the development of our country's industry. In principle, we do not import what can be produced domestically; we only import materials that cannot be produced domestically, or are produced domestically but not in sufficient quantities, and are indeed needed domestically. Some commodities are both imported and exported in order to meet the needs of the widespread development of foreign trade, and also to adjust varieties and meet the needs of certain areas with inconvenient transportation. Sometimes raw materials are imported and finished products are exported to support domestic industrial production. Our country imports thousands of kinds of commodities, with very complex specifications. Managing these commodities requires a high level of technical expertise. It reflects the rich content of our country's economic construction, and also reflects the complexity and arduousness of our country's foreign trade work.

    Currently, more than 80 percent of the materials imported by our country are supplied by the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, and only a small part is purchased from other countries. Most of the materials supplied by the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries are so-called “embargoed” materials by American imperialism, which is a guarantee for the smooth progress of our country's economic construction. The workers brothers of the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries take it as an honor to accept Chinese orders, and give priority to supplying China with excellent products.

    In order to ensure the needs of imports during the first five-year economic construction plan, it is necessary to organize the export of commodities accordingly. Most of the materials currently exported by our country are agricultural products, by-products, and native products. Many export materials, such as tea, silk, pig bristles, tung oil, peanuts, soybeans, etc., are materials with a long export history, and have always been well-known in the international market. Within five years, due to the growth of production, the quantity and variety of these commodities can be increased.

    In addition, since last year, our country has also restored or developed the export of many industrial products, including cotton cloth, knitwear, bicycles, sewing machines, thermos bottles, beer, other various famous wines, canned food, cigarettes, fountain pens, paper, steel, glass, cement, etc., chemical products and medicines are also exported. Last year, the value of these exported commodities reached 150 million yuan, and it has increased this year. These industrial products are mainly sold to Southeast Asian countries. The people of Southeast Asian countries, especially the overseas Chinese living in the area, are very fond of these commodities. A batch of bicycles arrived in Singapore and were immediately wholesale distributed by several overseas Chinese businessmen. Many overseas Chinese show their love for the motherland and are proud of riding Chinese bicycles and using Chinese fountain pens. According to the rice barter contract signed with Burma, our country has shipped the first and second batches of industrial products, about 16,000 tons, to Rangoon between July and August, including steel, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, blankets, paint, enamelware, and active convalescent beds. After these materials were transported, they were praised by officials from relevant departments of the Burmese government. Our country's "Qin Liangyu" bleached cloth sold out immediately after the first batch was launched in Rangoon. According to the trade agreement signed between China and the Egyptian government, our country will sell 60,000 tons of steel to Egypt. Certain complete sets of light industrial equipment in our country can also meet the needs of foreign countries.

    Our country exports commodities for national industrialization, which is carried out according to needs and possibilities, and exports are carried out differently according to the relationship between each commodity and the domestic people's lives and the possibility of export, and are not exported without limit. In the five years, grain and edible vegetable oil should be exported according to the principle of limited quantity. In the next few years, the export quantity will be maintained at the level of 1953 and 1954 respectively. Some commodities such as fruits, tea and various small local products should be exported as soon as possible; however, many commodities are exported after the domestic market has been properly taken care of and arranged, and the proportion of foreign sales is still small. Some materials, such as casings and feathers, are not needed much domestically but are needed a lot abroad. If the state does not purchase them for export, farmers will lose or consume them. Some materials, such as straw braid, certain kinds of Chinese medicinal materials, handicrafts, etc., if the state does not purchase them, farmers and handicraftsmen will not produce or reduce production. It can be seen that increasing the export of local and special products not only has little impact on people's lives, but also can promote the development of rural sideline production and increase the income of farmers, herdsmen, and handicraftsmen. As for the export of our country's industrial products, it not only marks the improvement of our country's industrial development level, but also can stimulate the development of our country's industry, especially local industry.

    Over the past few years, foreign trade has purchased the materials needed for our country's construction and sold the surplus and exportable materials from our country to foreign countries. Through this kind of "internal and external exchange," the production and sales of domestic materials have achieved a balance, promoting economic development, and has a positive effect on stabilizing the market and improving people's lives. In the future, foreign trade will continue to work hard to realize the first five-year economic construction plan. To this end, the foreign trade departments should, in accordance with the provisions of the first five-year plan, strengthen economic cooperation with the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, expand trade with the Soviet Union, and steadily increase trade with various people's democratic countries; at the same time, they should also cooperate with our country's peaceful diplomatic policy and develop trade with Asian, African countries and other capitalist countries in accordance with the principles of equality and mutual benefit. We must study the international market situation, actively organize the production of export materials, and strengthen the domestic procurement of export materials. We must maintain close contact with relevant departments and do a good job in ordering and accepting delivery of 156 industrial construction units and other equipment, so that the machinery, equipment and technical drawings supplied by the Soviet Union to our country, as well as all imported materials, can be put into construction and production in a timely manner. We must continuously improve the management and operation of foreign trade, improve work efficiency, consolidate and establish international credibility, overcome waste, practice strict economy, and do a good job in the socialist transformation of private import and export merchants.

    The important role of foreign trade in the national economy is increasingly recognized and valued by the broad masses of people throughout the country. Foreign trade work has been and will continue to receive the support of the people throughout the country and the party and government organs in various regions, and will actively move forward under their supervision. All staff members of the foreign trade system regard the completion of foreign trade tasks as a concrete and practical step to support and strive to realize the first five-year economic construction plan, and regard it as a very glorious task to be completed.

    为第一个五年计划服务的我国对外贸易
    赵继昌
    我国的对外贸易是国民经济的一个组成部分，担负着促进国内生产和改善人民生活的任务。旧中国的对外贸易，是帝国主义和官僚买办资产阶级榨取和摧残中国经济的重要手段。帝国主义国家以廉价获取了中国的资源，又以各种奢侈品运到中国来倾销，严重地打击了中国的民族工业，促使了农村经济的破产。解放后，我国实行了对外贸易管制和保护贸易政策，从根本上改变了旧中国对外贸易的殖民地、半殖民地性质。在平等互利和互助合作的基础上，我国发展了同苏联和各人民民主国家的贸易。通过这种新型的对外贸易，我们得到了各人民民主国家，特别是苏联的巨大帮助，对恢复我国国民经济，准备和实行发展国民经济第一个五年计划起了极为重要的作用。在平等互利的原则下，我国也恢复或发展了同亚洲、非洲国家，特别是东南亚国家以及西方资本主义国家的贸易。这对国民经济的恢复和发展也有一定的作用。
    在发展我国国民经济的第一个五年计划期间，我国对外贸易将有很大的发展。一九五七年我国对外贸易总额预计将比一九五二年增加百分之六十六点五。
    我国对外贸易的首要任务，是为发展重工业服务。苏联帮助我国设计的一百五十六个工业建设单位是我国工业建设的中心，我国五年内进口的物资，就有相当大的比重是这些单位在这个期间所需的设备和重要器材。在第一个五年计划期间，东欧人民民主国家也供应我国不少成套的工厂设备。美帝国主义对我国实行“禁运”政策，某些资本主义国家也想执行美帝国主义的“禁运”政策，迫使中国重新仰赖和依附他们，这种阴谋完全失败了。
    除了成套设备以外，我国还进口各种工业和交通运输所需的机器设备和原材料，如大型的和精密的工作母机、精密仪器、矿山机械、运输机械、起重机械、车辆、船舶、各种钢材、有色金属、电工电讯器材和化工原料等。进口这些器材，对改进现有设备、提高生产率、提高产品质量、保证生产计划的完成，都有重要的意义。此外，我国若干轻工业原料也不能完全满足需要。为此，以往几年我国曾进口了一定数量的棉花、橡胶、烤烟、黄麻、人造丝织和高级呢绒用的羊毛条；今后将根据工业生产需要和农业收成的情况，继续适当地进口这些工业原料，以保证工业生产和满足人民需要。
    第一个五年计划期间，我国对外贸易也要进口一些耕畜、农业机械、优良种籽、农药和相当数量的肥田粉，为发展农业和促进农业社会主义改造的事业服务。
    历年来，我国进口的物资以生产资料占绝对多数。在一九五四年的进口总额中，工农业生产和其他建设所需物资占百分之八十八点五，其中又以制造生产资料的物资占主要地位。这说明我国对外贸易一直是贯彻发展生产、特别是优先发展重工业的原则。但是，为了满足人民目前的急需，若干生活用品如糖、布、纸张、煤油、医药和少数文教用品也有进口，对改善人民生活，稳定市场均有一定作用。
    对外贸易的进口政策是：一方面保证国家生产建设的需要，一方面也要保护我国工业的发展。凡是国内能够生产的，原则上不进口；只有国内不能生产，或虽有生产但生产不足，而国内又确实需要的物资，我们才进口。某些商品既有进口，又有出口，是为了适应广泛发展对外贸易的需要，同时也可以调剂品种和适应某些交通不便的地区的需要。有时进口原料，出口成品，以扶植国内工业生产。我国进口的各种商品有数千种，规格十分复杂，经营这些商品需要有高度的技术水平，它反映了我国经济建设的丰富内容，也反映了我国对外贸易工作的复杂性和艰巨性。
    我国目前进口的物资，百分之八十以上是苏联和各人民民主国家供应的，只有少部分是从其他国家购买的。苏联和各人民民主国家供应我国的物资，绝大部分是美帝国主义所谓“禁运”物资，这是我国经济建设得以顺利进行的保障。苏联和各人民民主国家的工人弟兄以接受中国订货为光荣，都把优良的产品优先供应中国。
    为了保证第一个五年经济建设计划期间进口的需要，就必需相应地组织商品出口。我国目前出口的物资大部分是农产品、副产品和土产品。许多出口物资如茶叶、蚕丝、猪鬃、桐油、花生、大豆等都是出口历史很久的物资，并且一向闻名于国际市场。五年内，这些商品由于生产增长，都可以增加出口数量和品种。
    此外，从去年起，我国还恢复或发展了许多工业品的出口，其中有棉布、针织品、自行车、缝纫机、暖水壶、啤酒、其他各种名酒、罐头、纸烟、金笔、纸张、钢材、玻璃、水泥等，化学产品和医药也有出口，去年这些出口商品的价值，共达一亿五千万元，今年又有增加。这些工业品主要销售给东南亚各国，东南亚各国人民特别是住在当地的华侨对这些商品非常喜爱。有一批自行车到了新加坡，马上就被几家侨商批分了。很多华侨以骑中国自行车、用中国金笔表示自己对祖国的热爱，并引以自傲。我国根据同缅甸签订的大米易货合同，已把第一、二批工业品约一万六千吨，在七、八月间运抵仰光，其中有钢材、棉纱、棉布、毛毯、油漆、搪瓷器和活动疗养床等。这些物资运到后，受到缅甸政府有关部门官员的称赞，我国“秦良玉”漂布在仰光首批上市后，瞬即销售一空。根据中国同埃及政府签订的贸易协定，我国将卖给埃及六万吨钢材。我国某些成套的轻工业设备，也可以供应国外的需要。
    我国出口商品是为了国家工业化，是根据需要和可能进行的，是根据每种商品对国内人民生活关系的大小和出口的可能来有分别地出口，并不是无限量地出口。五年中，粮食和食用植物油要根据限量的原则出口，今后几年出口数量分别维持在一九五三年和一九五四年的水平上。有些商品如水果、茶叶和各种小土产，应尽先出口；但许多商品都是在适当照顾和安排了国内市场之后再出口的，外销的比重仍较小。有些物资如肠衣、羽毛等，国内需要不多而国外很需要，如国家不收购出口，农民也就会丢掉或消耗掉。有些物资如草帽辫、若干种中药材、手工艺品等，如果国家不收购，农民和手工业者也就不生产或者减产。由此可见，增加土特产的出口，不但对人民生活没有多大影响，而且可以促进农村副业生产的发展，增加农民、牧民、手工业者的收入。至于我国工业品的出口不仅标志着我国工业发展水平的提高，而且可以刺激我国工业，特别是地方工业的发展。
    几年来，对外贸易把我国建设需要的物资购买回来，把我国多余的和可以出口的物资销售国外，经过这种“内外交流”，使国内物资产销取得平衡，促进了经济的发展，对稳定市场和改善人民生活，都有积极的作用。今后对外贸易还将继续为实现第一个五年的经济建设计划而努力。为此，对外贸易部门应当根据第一个五年计划的规定，加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的经济合作，扩大对苏联的贸易，稳步地增长对各人民民主国家的贸易；同时也要配合我国和平外交政策，根据平等、互利的原则，发展对亚、非国家以及其他资本主义国家的贸易。要研究国际市场情况，积极地组织出口物资的生产，加强出口物资的国内收购工作。要同有关部门取得密切联系，做好一百五十六项工业建设单位以及其他各项器材的订货和到货接交工作，使苏联供应我国的机器设备和技术图纸以及所有进口物资，都能及时投入建设和生产。要不断改进对外贸易的经营管理工作，提高工作效率，巩固和树立国际信誉，克服浪费，厉行节约，并做好对私营进出口商的社会主义改造工作。
    对外贸易在国民经济中的重要作用，正日益为全国广大人民所认识和重视。对外贸易工作曾经并且将要继续得到全国人民和各地党政机关的支持，并在他们的监督下积极前进。对外贸易系统全体工作人员把完成对外贸易任务当作拥护和努力实现第一个五年经济建设计划的具体实际步骤，并且把它当作十分光荣的任务去完成。
