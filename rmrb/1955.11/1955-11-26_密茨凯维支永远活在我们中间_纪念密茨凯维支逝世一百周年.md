　　Mickiewicz Lives Forever Among Us
　　--Commemorating the Centenary of Mickiewicz's Death
　　Ge Baoquan
　　Today (November 26th) marks the exact centenary of the death of Adam Mickiewicz, the great poet of the Polish people.

　　Adam Mickiewicz's name is very familiar and dear to the vast number of Chinese readers. As early as 1907, Lu Xun, the founder of China's New Literature, first mentioned Mickiewicz's name in an article on romantic poetry ("The Power of Mara Poetry") published in the "Henan" magazine, placing him on par with Byron, Shelley, Pushkin, Lermontov, Petőfi, and Słowacki. He wrote: "...The poems made by Mickiewicz contain the voices of people of both past and present, entrusting them to the poems. The voices in the poems are clear, resonant, and powerful, and they convey all kinds of feelings. They fill the sky over a corner of Poland with song, and even today, the influence on the hearts of the Polish people is still limitless... Mickiewicz was born in the endless echoes of that song." In many years that followed, Lu Xun often mentioned Mickiewicz's name. When the "Benliu" magazine published Mickiewicz's famous poem "Ode to Youth" in 1929, he wrote in the editor's note of the magazine:
　　"Mickiewicz was a poet of Poland under the oppression of foreign races. What he advocated was revenge, what he sought was liberation. Twenty or thirty years ago, it was enough to arouse the resonance of Chinese youth. I have talked about his life and works in 'The Power of Mara Poetry'..." In 1935, he wrote in an article "'Title Undecided' Draft": "'Introducing Polish Poets' started thirty years ago with my 'The Power of Mara Poetry'. At that time, the Manchus ruled China, and the Han people were subjugated. China's situation was quite similar to Poland's, so it was easy to resonate with their poems..." From these many places, we can see how much Lu Xun admired and loved Mickiewicz.

　　Mickiewicz's poems have been successively introduced to our country, and have not even been interrupted during the difficult years of the Anti-Japanese War. His poems were introduced in poetry publications published in Guilin at that time. After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Mickiewicz's works have been more widely disseminated. In 1950, the Chinese translation of "Pan Tadeusz" was published, and in 1954, "Selected Poems of Mickiewicz" was published. This year, to commemorate the centenary of his death, a new commemorative edition of "Pan Tadeusz" has been published. A new version of "Selected Poems of Mickiewicz" will also be published next year. His long poem "Grażyna" has also been translated into Chinese and printed in his "Selected Poems." Currently being translated are his long poem "Konrad Wallenrod" and his essays and prose works, etc.

　　Mickiewicz once dreamed in the epilogue of his long poem "Pan Tadeusz":
　　　I wish I could live to see that happy day,
　　　When this book could circulate in the countryside, –
　　　The peasant girls spinning flax
　　　Singing in low voices not only simple songs, …
　　　I hope that the girls will also pick up this book,
　　　As simple as folk songs.

　　Mickiewicz's dream and hope have long been realized. In the People's Poland, his works are widely loved by the people; at the same time, his works have long crossed the borders of his motherland and are today recited by vast numbers of Chinese readers. Mickiewicz's works are deeply understood by us, and in Lu Xun's words, are "easy to resonate with." What we especially feel close to and deeply understand is his spirit of dedicating his life to the revolutionary cause and his infinite loyalty to his motherland and his people until the day he died. He once spoke through the mouth of the hero Konrad in his long poem "Forefathers' Eve":

　　　I and my motherland are one whole.
　　　My name is millions, - I love as they do,
　　　I feel their pain and sorrow as they do;
　　　I look at the misfortune of my motherland,
　　　Like a son looking at his father being caught in the wheels;
　　　I feel all the disasters of our people,
　　　Like a mother feels the pain of carrying a child.

　　Mickiewicz not only dedicated his life to the struggle for the liberation of the Polish people, but he also had boundless confidence in the bright and beautiful future of mankind. When he was in exile in Paris editing the "Tribune of the People," he spoke of socialism, saying that "Socialism is a completely new word, and the old society and all its representatives, if they do not understand the meaning of this word, they all read the death sentence in this word..." He also said: "Socialism is a completely new phenomenon, which shows new aspirations and new enthusiasm that the people of the old society cannot understand." Although Mickiewicz died in Constantinople in a foreign land, and was unable to see his motherland and people gain freedom and liberation before his death, he had done his best in the struggle for a bright future, and had shown a new path to future generations and the people of all countries.

　　Mickiewicz's dreams and aspirations have been realized in today's People's Poland and in the great family of peace, democracy, and socialism led by the Soviet Union.

　　It has been a full one hundred years since the death of the great Polish poet Mickiewicz. When the Fifth World Youth and Student Peace and Friendship Festival was held in Warsaw in August this year, the passionate verses in Mickiewicz's "Ode to Youth," written as early as 1820, once again excited our hearts with new strength and rang in our ears:

　　　Young friends, unite!
　　　The happiness of the masses is our aim;
　　　With unity and strength, with passion and wisdom,
　　　Young friends, let us move forward!
　　　Lucky are those who fall in the struggle, those who, as steps toward the city of glory, recklessly give themselves. Unite, friends! Unite! No matter how rugged and slippery this road is, no matter how violence and weakness hinder our progress, we must resist violence with violence, and as for weakness, we must know how to overcome it when we are young! As the Polish people and progressive people all over the world commemorate Mickiewicz, this great poet, may his glorious name live forever in our hearts, and may his passionate verses forever call us and inspire us to move forward towards the bright and beautiful future of mankind!

　　密茨凯维支永远活在我们中间
　　——纪念密茨凯维支逝世一百周年
　　戈宝权
　　波兰人民的伟大诗人亚当·密茨凯维支逝世到今天（十一月二十六日），恰好一百周年了。
    亚当·密茨凯维支的名字对于中国广大的读者们，是非常熟悉而又亲切的。远在一九○七年时，中国新文学的奠基者鲁迅先生，就曾经在“河南”杂志上所发表的一篇论浪漫主义诗歌（“摩罗诗力说”）的文章中，最初提到了密茨凯维支的名字，将他同拜伦、雪莱、普希金、莱蒙托夫、裴多菲和斯洛伐茨基等人相提并论。他这样写道：“……密克威支所为诗，有今昔国人之声，寄于是焉。诸凡诗中之声，清澈弘厉，万感悉至，直至波兰一角之天，悉满歌声，虽至今日，而影响于波兰人之心者，力犹无限。……密克威支者，盖即生于彼歌声反响之中，至于无尽者夫。”在此后的许多年代当中，鲁迅先生常常提到密茨凯维支的名字。当“奔流”杂志在一九二九年发表了密茨凯维支的名诗“青春的赞颂”时，他在杂志的编后记中写道：
  “密克威支是波兰在异族压迫之下的时代的诗人，所鼓吹的是复仇，所希求的是解放，在二三十年前，是很足以招致中国青年的共鸣的。我曾在‘摩罗诗力说’里，讲过他的生涯和著作，……”一九三五年他在“‘题未定’草”一文中又写道：“‘绍介波兰诗人’，还在三十年前，始于我的‘摩罗诗力说’。那时满清宰华，汉民受制，中国境遇，颇类波兰，读其诗歌，即易于心心相印，……”从这许多地方，我们都可以看出鲁迅先生对密茨凯维支是怎样地推崇和热爱。
    密茨凯维支的诗歌作品，曾被陆续介绍到我国来，甚至当我们在抗日战争的艰苦年代里，也没有间断过，当时在桂林出版的诗歌刊物上就介绍过他的诗。一九四九年中华人民共和国成立之后，密茨凯维支的作品获得了更广泛的传播。一九五○年，
  “塔杜施先生”的中译本出版，一九五四年“密茨凯维支诗选”出版。今年为了纪念他的逝世百周年，“塔杜施先生”出了新的纪念版。“密茨凯维支诗选”的新版本明年也将出版。他的长诗“格拉席娜”也被译成中文，印在他的“诗选”中。现在正在翻译中的，还有他的长诗“康拉德·华伦洛德”和他的论文及散文作品等。
    密茨凯维支在长诗“塔杜施先生”的尾声中曾经这样梦想过：
      我愿能活到那快乐的一天，
      这一本书能在乡村中流传，——
      纺织麻线，那些农家的姑娘们
      低声唱着的不仅仅是朴素的歌曲，……
      但愿姑娘们也会拿起这本书来，
      它像民间歌曲一样地朴素。
    密茨凯维支的这个梦想和希望，早已实现了。在人民的波兰，他的作品被人民广泛地热爱着；同时他的作品早已越出他的祖国的边疆，在今天也为广大的中国读者所传诵。密茨凯维支的作品，是我们能深切理解的，用鲁迅先生的话来说，是“易于心心相印”的。我们尤其感到亲切的和深切理解的，是他一生中直到死的一天献身于革命事业和他对于自己的祖国、对于自己的人民的无限忠诚的那种精神。他曾经通过他的长诗“先人祭”中的英雄康拉德的嘴，讲出了这样的话：
    我和我的祖国是一个整体。
    我的名字是百万大众，—我像他们一样爱，
    我也一样感受着他们的痛苦和悲哀；
      我望着我的祖国的不幸，
      像儿子望着他的被卷进了车轮的父亲；
    我感到我们人民的全部灾难，
    像母亲感到她的怀着孩子的痛苦。
    密茨凯维支不仅是为了争取波兰人民的解放斗争献出了他的一生，他对于人类的光明美好的未来也充满了无限的信心。当他远在巴黎流亡期间编辑“人民论坛”报时，他就讲到了社会主义，说“社会主义完全是一个崭新的字样，旧社会和它的所有代表者，假如他们不了解这个字的意义，他们都在这个字的当中读到了死刑的判决……”；他又说道：“社会主义是一个崭新的现象，它表现出了旧社会的人们所不能理解的新的向往和新的热情。”密茨凯维支虽然死在异乡的君士坦丁堡，在临死之前没有能看到自己的祖国和人民获得自由解放，但他已在争取光明的未来的斗争中尽了他的全部心力，并且为后代和各国的人民昭示出了一条新的途径。
    密茨凯维支的这些梦想和向往，在今天的人民波兰和以苏联为首的和平、民主及社会主义的大家庭里已经得到了实现。
    伟大的波兰诗人密茨凯维支逝世已是整整一百年了，当今年八月间在华沙城举行第五届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节的时候，密茨凯维支远在一八二○年所写的“青春颂”中的热情的诗句，又以新的力量激动着我们的心，响在我们的耳中：
      年轻的朋友们，联合起来！
      大众的幸福是我们的方针；
      以团结而坚强，以热情而智慧，
      年轻的朋友们，我们前进！
      幸运的是那些在斗争中倒下，是那些作为向着光荣之城去的阶梯，奋不顾身的人们。联合起来，朋友们！联合起来！不管这路的崎岖和溜滑，不管暴力和软弱怎样阻挡着前进，我们要用暴力抵抗暴力，软弱呢，幼小时就要知道怎样战胜！当今天波兰人民和全世界进步的人士都纪念着密茨凯维支这位伟大诗人的时候，愿他的光辉的名字永远活在我们的心中，愿他的充满激情的诗句永远号召着我们和鼓舞着我们，向着人类光明美好的未来前进！
