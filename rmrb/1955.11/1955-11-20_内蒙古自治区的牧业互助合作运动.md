　　The Pastoral Mutual Aid and Cooperation Movement in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
　　By our reporter Lin Mo
    In the pastoral areas of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, there are now more than 5,000 various types of pastoral mutual aid teams and eight pastoral production cooperatives (trial); herdsmen participating in mutual aid and cooperative organizations account for about 40 percent of the total number of pastoral households in the region. In the Hulunbuir League, which was liberated earlier, more than half of the herdsmen have joined various mutual aid organizations.
    Like the agricultural areas of Inner Mongolia, the pastoral areas must realize socialist transformation through the path of mutual aid and cooperation. Only by changing the scattered individual animal husbandry production into collective and modernized animal husbandry production can the material and cultural lives of the broad masses of herdsmen be fundamentally improved. However, the transformation of animal husbandry, which is even more backward in production, is more complex than agriculture, and its realization requires more time.
    On the grasslands of Inner Mongolia, herdsmen have always had the habit of mutual assistance. Herdsmen are completely dependent on natural grasslands for their livelihoods, living a nomadic life in search of water and grass, and often encounter wind, snow, and wolf hazards, which cause many difficulties in production and life. Therefore, herdsmen often graze together in groups of three to five families. They can borrow vehicles and production tools from each other, take care of each other's herds, and when they encounter natural disasters such as wind and snow, they can work together to rescue people and livestock. Therefore, herdsmen have formed the habit of mutual assistance in their long nomadic life. The units where several herdsmen families naturally live together are called "Hurqi" by the herdsmen, and in some places they are also called "Haote" or "Shaorqi," etc. These words all contain the meaning of mutual assistance or residents' groups in Mongolian.
    In the old society, some "Hurqi" or "Haote" were centered on wealthy herdsmen or livestock owners with more livestock, and herdsmen and poor herdsmen followed them, and there was an exploitative relationship between them; but more commonly, several relatives and friends were united together.
    After liberation, social reforms were carried out in the pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia, and feudal privileges were abolished; herdsmen gained democratic rights and conditions for developing production, and actively demanded to develop production and improve their lives. At this time, the Party Committee and the People's Government of the Autonomous Region called on herdsmen to organize mutual aid and cooperation to overcome difficulties and develop production. On the basis of the herdsmen's old habit of mutual assistance, some low-level mutual aid organizations with socialist budding characteristics appeared one after another. For example, the Gangguoer perennial mutual aid team in the Wangong Sumu (district) of Chen Barag Banner (county) was organized in 1948. At that time, three households were together, and because they had few livestock, they could not maintain their lives, so they combined their livestock into a group, which was grazed by one person, and the three households combined their draught animals and labor to pull salt and transport nitrate for sideline production. The Heheletai mutual aid team, which has now been transformed into a pastoral production cooperative, was originally organized in this way. In 1948, the herdsman Heheletai raised a few livestock and had to engage in sideline production, and he could not take care of both by himself. As a result, the livestock was harmed by wolves, and the losses were more than the income from sideline production. In 1949, he cooperated with two other households, and the livestock was not harmed, and there was more income from sideline production. Heheletai experienced the benefits of mutual assistance. By 1950, he had united with three other herdsmen households to cut grass, and as a result, the grass cut was twice as much as when he worked alone in previous years. Because of his achievements in mutual aid production, Heheletai was rewarded by the People's Government twice in 1949 and 1950. When the Autonomous Region People's Government issued pastoral loans in 1950, the four households of the Heheletai mutual aid team borrowed 100 sheep each. With these livestock, they needed mutual aid and cooperation even more, because if the four families grazed these livestock separately, it would be difficult for each family to have the sheds, yurts, vehicles, and horses needed for grazing, and the labor force would also feel insufficient. At this time, the four households decided to continue to help each other, and their mutual aid team changed from a temporary mutual aid team to a perennial mutual aid team. Three years later, the four households' private livestock increased from 40 to 602.
    After liberation, the herdsmen's livestock increased rapidly (the livestock in the Inner Mongolia region has increased nearly two times from the early days of liberation to the present), and the shortage of manpower is also a reason that prompted the herdsmen to actively participate in mutual aid organizations. The shortage of manpower is most obvious during the busy lambing season of animal husbandry production. In order to ensure the smooth lambing, it is necessary to build sheds, prepare feed, take care of the ewes, and raise the young livestock. When the lambing season arrives, individual herdsmen are often too busy, so they find objects to form seasonal mutual aid teams. In the past two years, in many areas, 80 to 90 percent of the herdsmen have participated in mutual aid teams during lambing.
    The mutual aid and cooperative organizations in the pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia have gradually developed and improved in practice. For example, the method of the mutual aid team to solve the problem of mutual benefit was initially just a few families grazing and producing together, without calculating the amount of labor and livestock of each family. Although people with less livestock and more labor would suffer losses, it was still beneficial to production compared with not helping each other. Later, they further created the method of taking turns to work and exchanging labor to supplement wages according to the number of livestock in each household, which could further mobilize the labor enthusiasm of the team members. In some perennial mutual aid teams, the livestock owners pay grazing fees to the team, and the team members jointly distribute the income. This method is more reasonable than the previous one. However, the distribution of grazing fees and sideline income was initially based on the principle of equal distribution per household, regardless of the amount of labor contributed by each family; later, it was distributed equally according to the number of people participating in labor; then, people were divided into full labor force and half labor force; and finally, each person's labor was evaluated according to three grades: upper, middle, and lower.
    In terms of the division of labor, the pastoral mutual aid teams have also gradually improved from simple to detailed according to the herdsmen's experience and production needs, with the enlightenment and help of the staff. For example, at the beginning, a part of the people were simply assigned to graze, and a part of the people stayed in the settlement to do various chores. Later, various groups such as nomadic, settlement, and sideline production were divided, and each group was further divided according to the different jobs in each season, such as grazing, surveying pastures, building sheds, lambing, and raising young livestock, and specialized and responsible jobs were implemented. In terms of production plans, they have also been gradually improved from rough to detailed. Now, some better perennial mutual aid teams have learned to plan and arrange production regularly.
    The herdsmen have cultivated the habit of collective production in the mutual aid teams and cooperatives, strengthened collectivist ideology, and learned the experience of collective management of production. Therefore, mutual aid and cooperative organizations are a good school for the broad masses of herdsmen to transition from individual production to collective production.
    Facts have proved that pastoral mutual aid and cooperative organizations have become the main reliance for the reform of animal husbandry production technology. At present, to ensure the development of livestock and avoid the death of livestock, the most important method is to mobilize herdsmen to do a good job in grazing, preparing grass and materials, building sheds, protecting livestock from wolves, and preventing and controlling livestock diseases. At present, Inner Mongolia's animal husbandry production is still completely dependent on natural grasslands for grazing. Once there is poor water and grass and wind and snow disasters, it will cause a large number of livestock deaths. To change this situation, it is necessary to mobilize herdsmen to implement the method of settling and grazing, gradually learn to plant pasture, feed and even vegetables and grains in the settlements, open up artificial feed bases, and gradually combine animal husbandry with agriculture. Only in this way can animal husbandry production obtain a solid foundation. However, these major reforms in animal husbandry production can only be undertaken by mutual aid and cooperative organizations. This year, the Yikezhao League planted more than 120,000 mu of pasture, most of which were collectively planted by mutual aid teams. The Zhaogejile mutual aid team in Junwang Banner has dug more than 50 wells in recent years to solve the problem of insufficient water and grass. In recent years, in order to enable livestock in pastoral areas to successfully survive the winter and spring, the government has called on herdsmen to prepare grass and materials and build sheds every year. The vast majority of those who have truly achieved success are mutual aid teams or cooperatives. For example, the Hongqi Pastoral Production Cooperative in Baling Right Banner prepared more than 290,000 catties of feed and 3,500 catties of material for livestock last winter, and built 800 square meters of pens and 67 sheds. Therefore, when wind and snow disasters occur, the more and better mutual aid and cooperative organizations develop, the less livestock die.
    Recently, in the resolution on the development of agricultural and pastoral production mutual aid and cooperation adopted by the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Representative Conference of the Communist Party of China, the proposed policy for the development of pastoral mutual aid and cooperation is: vigorously develop temporary and seasonal mutual aid teams for herding livestock together, consolidate and develop perennial mutual aid teams, actively conduct trials and steadily develop pastoral production cooperatives; at the same time, run state-owned farms well and give play to their demonstration role. According to the plan for the development of pastoral mutual aid and cooperation initially formulated by the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, by 1957, herdsmen participating in pastoral mutual aid and cooperation will reach 60 percent of the total number of pastoral households, and pastoral production cooperatives will be tried and developed to about 50. Each banner in the pastoral area should at least try to run a pastoral production cooperative. In order to complete this plan, Party committees at all levels in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region should strengthen the leadership of pastoral mutual aid and cooperation, strengthen Party building in pastoral areas, and closely integrate the promotion of settled grazing, improvement of production technology, disaster prevention and livestock protection with mutual aid and cooperation.

　　内蒙古自治区的牧业互助合作运动
　　本报记者　林沫
    在内蒙古自治区的牧业区，现在已经有各种类型的牧业互助组五千多个、牧业生产合作社（试办）八个，加入互助合作组织的牧民约占全区牧业户总户数的百分之四十。在解放较早的呼伦贝尔盟，参加各种互助组织的牧民已经达到一半以上。
    内蒙古的牧业区和农业区一样，要通过互助合作的道路实现社会主义改造。因为只有把分散的个体的畜牧业生产改变为集体的、现代化的畜牧业生产，广大牧民的物质、文化生活才能得到根本的改善。不过，对于生产更加落后的畜牧业的改造，较之农业更为复杂，它的实现，需要更多的时间。
    在内蒙古地区的草原上，牧民们历来就有互助的习惯。牧民完全依赖自然草原为生，过着逐水草而居的游牧生活，经常遇到风、雪、狼害，在生产和生活上就发生很多困难。因此，牧民常常是三、五家人在一起游牧。他们之间可以互相借用车辆和生产工具，互相照顾畜群，遇到风雪等自然灾害时，可以合力抢救人、畜。所以，牧民在长期的游牧生活中形成了互助的习惯。牧民几家人自然聚居的单位，牧民们称它为“胡尔其”，有的地方又叫“浩特”或“绍尔其”等，这些字眼在蒙语中都含有互助或居民组的意思。
    旧社会的“胡尔其”或“浩特”，有些是以牲畜多的富裕的牧民或牧主为中心的，跟着他们行动的有牧工和贫苦牧民，他们之间有剥削关系；但是更普遍的则是几家亲属、朋友互相联合在一起。
    解放后，内蒙古牧业区进行了社会改革，废除了封建特权；牧民获得了民主权利和发展生产的条件，积极要求发展生产，改善生活。这时，自治区的党委和人民政府就号召牧民组织互助合作，克服困难，发展生产。在牧民旧有的互助习惯的基础上，各地先后出现了一些低级的带有社会主义萌芽性质的互助组织。如现在陈巴尔虎旗（县）完工苏木（区）的刚果尔常年互助组，就是在一九四八年组织的。那时，他们三户人在一起，因牲畜少，不能维持生活，就把牲畜合成一群，由一个人放牧，另把三家的役畜和劳动力联合起来去拉盐、运硝，进行副业生产。现在已经转为牧业生产合作社的胡和勒泰互助组，最初也是这样组织起来的。一九四八年，牧民胡和勒泰养着几头牲畜，又要搞副业，一个人照顾不了两头，结果牲畜受到狼害，所受的损失比搞副业的收入还多。一九四九年他就同另外两户互助起来，牲畜没有受损失，副业方面也有了更多的收入。胡和勒泰体验到互助的好处，到一九五○年，又和三户牧民联合起来去打草，结果打的草比往年自己单干时打的多一倍。胡和勒泰因为互助生产有成绩，在一九四九年和一九五○年，两次受到人民政府的奖励。在一九五○年自治区人民政府发放牧业贷款的时候，胡和勒泰互助组四户人每户借到一百只羊。有了这些牲畜，他们就更加需要互助合作，因为如果四家单独放牧这些牲畜，游牧所需要的棚圈、蒙古包、车辆、马匹等，各家都很难齐备，劳动力也感不足。这时他们四户就决心互助下去，他们的互助组就由临时互助组变成了常年互助组。三年以后，四户私有的牲畜由四十只增加到六百零二只。
    解放后，牧民的牲畜迅速增加（内蒙古全区的牲畜从解放初期到现在增加了将近二倍），人力不足，这也是促使牧民积极参加互助组织的一个原因。人力不足在牧业生产繁忙的接羔季节表现得最为明显。为了顺利接羔，需要搭盖棚圈，准备饲料，照顾母畜，饲养幼畜。到了接羔季节，单干牧民往往忙不过来，就自找对象成立季节性的互助组。近两年来，在很多地区，百分之八十到九十的牧民在接羔的时候都要参加互助组。
    内蒙古牧区的互助合作组织是在实践中逐步发展和逐步提高起来的。例如，互助组解决互利问题的办法，最初只是几家在一起合伙放牧生产，并不计算各家的劳动力和牲畜多少，虽然牲畜少，劳动力多的人就要吃亏，但是这样比起不互助，还是对生产有利的。后来就进一步创造了根据各户的牲畜数量轮流出工、互相换工补工资的办法，这样就可以进一步发挥组员的劳动积极性。在一些常年互助组里，则由畜主向组内出放牧费，组员共同分配收益。这办法较前一种更为合理。不过放牧费和副业收入的分配，最初也还是不论各家出劳动力多少，采取一律按户平分的办法；以后按参加劳动的人数来平分；再后又把人分为全劳动力和半劳动力；最后又按上、中、下三等来评定每人的劳动。
    牧业互助组在劳动分工方面，也是根据牧民的经验和生产需要，经工作人员的启发和帮助，由简单到细致逐步提高的。如起初只是简单地分出一部分人去放牧，一部分人留在定居地作各种杂活。以后分出游牧、定居、副业生产等各种小组，各小组内又根据放牧、勘察牧场、搭棚盖圈、接羔、饲养幼畜等各个季节的不同活路，进一步分工，实行专职专责。在生产计划方面，也是由粗到细，现在有些较好的常年互助组，已学会经常筹划和安排生产。
    牧民在互助组、合作社中培养了集体生产的习惯，加强了集体主义思想，学习了集体管理生产的经验。所以互助合作组织是广大牧民由个体生产过渡到集体生产的一个很好的学校。
    事实证明，牧业互助合作组织，已经成为牧业生产技术改革的主要依靠。从目前说来，要保证牲畜的发展，避免牲畜的死亡，最主要的办法是发动牧民作好放牧、打草备料、搭盖棚圈、打狼保畜、防治牲畜疫病等项工作。目前内蒙古的牧业生产还是完全依赖自然草原进行放牧，一遇到水草不好和风雪灾害，就会造成牲畜的大批死亡。要改变这种状况，必须发动牧民实行定居游牧的办法，在定居地逐渐学习种植牧草、饲料以至蔬菜和粮食，开辟人工饲料基地，逐步使牧业同农业结合起来。这样才能使牧业生产获得稳固的基础。但是，牧业生产上的这些重大的改革，只有互助合作组织才能担当起来。伊克昭盟今年种植了十二万多亩牧草，其中绝大部分都是互助组集体种的。郡王旗朝格吉勒互助组，为解决水草不足的问题，几年来打了五十多眼井。近几年来，为使牧区牲畜顺利度过冬春，政府年年号召牧民打草备料，搭棚盖圈，真正作得有成效的，绝大多数是互助组或合作社。如巴林右翼旗红旗牧业生产合作社，去年冬季给牲畜准备了二十九万多斤饲草，三千五百斤料，修建了八百平方公尺的圈和六十七间棚。所以当风雪灾害发生的时候，哪里的互助合作组织发展得较多较好，哪里的牲畜死亡的就较少。
    最近，在中共内蒙古自治区代表会议关于发展农牧生产互助合作的决议中，提出的发展牧业互助合作的方针是：大力发展临时季节性的合群放牧的互助组，巩固和发展常年互助组，积极试办和稳步发展牧业生产合作社；同时要办好国营牧场，发挥它们的示范作用。根据中共内蒙古区党委初步拟定的牧业互助合作发展的计划，到一九五七年参加牧业互助合作的牧民，将达到总牧户的百分之六十，牧业生产合作社将试办和发展到五十个左右，牧区的每个旗至少应试办一个牧业生产合作社。为了完成这个计划，内蒙古自治区各级党委应当加强对牧业互助合作的领导，加强牧区的建党工作，把推行定居游牧、改进生产技术、防灾保畜等项工作同互助合作密切结合起来。
