　  Shandong Improves Winter Wheat Sowing Work
    By the end of October, Shandong Province had sown over 60 million mu of winter wheat, accounting for more than 96% of the planned wheat planting area. This year, during the winter wheat sowing, many agricultural production cooperatives changed from three crops in two years to two crops in one year. According to statistics from 131 agricultural cooperatives in Tancheng County, the average wheat field area expanded by 5% compared to last year. Thanks to the vigorous promotion of double-wheeled double-铧 plows, the area of deep plowing in wheat fields in various regions has also expanded. The deep plowing area in Dezhou Prefecture has doubled compared to last year. Taian Prefecture generally deepened by one to two inches compared to last year. This year, the area sown with improved varieties of winter wheat in the province has expanded to about 80%.
    At present, winter wheat in the province generally has complete and robust seedling emergence. Individual areas with missing seedlings are carrying out seedling inspection and replanting work.

　  山东改进了冬麦播种工作
    山东省到十月底统计，已播种冬小麦六千多万亩，占计划种麦面积的百分之九十六以上。今年冬小麦播种时，许多农业生产合作社将二年三作改为一年二作，根据郯城县一百三十一个农业合作社的统计，平均比去年扩大麦田百分之五。由于大力推广了双轮双铧犁，各地麦田深耕面积也扩大了。德州专区深耕面积比去年扩大了两倍。泰安专区一般较去年加深一寸到二寸。全省今年冬小麦施用良种面积已扩大到百分之八十左右。
    目前全省冬小麦一般出苗齐全，生长茁壮，个别缺苗地区正在进行查苗补苗等工作。
