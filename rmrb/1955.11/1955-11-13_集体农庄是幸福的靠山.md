Collective Farm is a Reliable Backer of Happiness
Editor:
　　The thirty-eighth anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution is also the third anniversary of the establishment of our Sino-Soviet Friendship Collective Farm. Over the past three years, under the principles of collective labor and remuneration according to work, we have eradicated the roots of poverty and laid the foundation for common prosperity.
    After our farm was established, we encountered many difficulties. Thanks to the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and thanks to the example of our Soviet elder brother, we overcame all difficulties and achieved increased production year after year. Although the drought was very severe this year, our crops still grew very well. According to preliminary calculations, the total output of more than 10,000 mu of land in the village increased by 1.08 million jin of grain compared with last year. Among them, more than 6,000 mu of millet can produce 270 jin per mu, which is 38 jin more than the original plan and 63 jin more than last year. The yield of wheat per mu reached 172 jin, more than double the first year of the farm's establishment. Although more than 8,000 mu of corn suffered from the disaster, because artificial pollination was adopted, each mu still increased by 45 jin compared with last year.
    The annual increase in production of our farm is inseparable from the brotherly assistance of our Soviet elder brother. For example, most of the land cultivation, sowing, threshing, pressing, and seed selection on our farm are done using Soviet-made tractors and various agricultural machinery, which enables us to save a lot of labor and carry out land construction and water conservancy projects. In the first half of this year, we drilled 58 water wells and two electric medium-sized water wells, turning more than 800 mu of land into paddy fields. At the recent meeting of the village representatives, we also decided on the farm's five-year water conservancy construction plan, to turn nearly 10,000 mu of land into paddy fields by 1957. By that time, we will basically be able to conquer the "nine droughts in ten years" disaster in the Taihang Mountains.
    We are extensively using the advanced agricultural production experience of the Soviet Union. For example, the planting density of wheat and autumn crops this year is generally 10% higher than last year, and the corn is planted in a square pattern, which ensures a large increase in production. The more than 300 mu of hybrid corn trial-planted by the farm this year has a very high yield. According to the Soviet farm's common practice of fixed production and over-quota rewards, we established a personal contract responsibility system in each production team this year to ensure the timely sowing, thinning, cultivating, and artificial pollination of various crops. We are learning from the Soviet farm's method of operating a variety of economies. This year, we established a cattle breeding team with more than 100 cattle, expanded the pig farm, and plan to raise 2,000 pigs next year. We also established an oil pressing plant and expanded the planting area of vegetable gardens and orchards. In addition, according to the needs of the villagers to build houses, the farm established a lime kiln, a brick and tile factory, and an iron and wood construction team. The income from these side businesses can reach 100,000 yuan per year.
    This year, the total income of our village's agriculture and sideline businesses is more than 454,000 yuan, an increase of 41% over last year. The payment in kind for each work day increased from 13.5 jin of grain last year to more than 15 jin; the total amount of labor distribution increased by 30% this year compared with last year. For example, villager Zhen Xingfa, a family of three, had an actual income of 778 jin of grain per year before joining the village, and this year he received 3,073 jin of grain, plus 94 yuan in cash. In addition to having enough to eat and use, he also sold more than 1,700 jin of grain to the state. The situation of most villagers is similar to that of Zhen Xingfa. Therefore, when the villagers distributed grain, they excitedly said: The collective farm is really a reliable backer of our happiness. Because the income of the villagers is constantly increasing, more than 100 households have built houses in the past two years; the villagers' food, clothing, and home furnishings are also better than in the past. Our cultural life has also greatly improved. There are already two complete primary schools and five adult spare-time schools in the village. The spare-time schools offer five professional courses: machinery, agriculture, accounting, health, and animal husbandry. There are four libraries in the village, which subscribe to more than 70 newspapers and periodicals. The amateur theater troupe performed programs singing about our own production and life. The farm's medical staff regularly give the villagers physical examinations and treat various diseases.
    The continuous growth of our production and the improvement of our lives are because we have learned from the experience of the Soviet Union and embarked on the happy road of collective farms. When commemorating the October Revolution Day, we pledge with infinite gratitude to run our farm better and guide the vast number of peasant brothers to gradually embark on this bright road.

### 集体农庄是幸福的靠山

　　集体农庄是幸福的靠山编辑同志：
    伟大的十月社会主义革命三十八周年纪念日，也是我们中苏友好集体农庄建庄三周年的日子。三年来，我们在集体劳动和按劳取酬的原则下，拔除了贫困的根子，奠定了共同富裕的基石。
    我们农庄建立以后，曾经遇到过不少困难。由于有党和毛主席的领导，由于有苏联老大哥的榜样，我们战胜了一切困难，做到年年增产。今年虽然旱灾很严重，但是我们的庄稼仍是长得很好。据初步计算：全庄一万多亩土地，比去年增产一百零八万斤粮食。其中有六千多亩谷子，每亩能产二百七十多斤，比原计划多收三十八斤，比去年增产六十三斤。小麦每亩产量达到一百七十二斤，比建庄的头一年提高了二倍以上。有八千多亩玉米虽然受了灾，因为采用了人工辅助授粉的办法，每亩仍然比去年增产四十五斤。
    我们农庄年年增产，是同苏联老大哥兄弟般的援助分不开的。例如，我们农庄大部分土地的耕作、播种、脱粒、压地、选种，都使用了苏联制造的拖拉机和各种农业机械，使我们能够节省大量的劳动力，进行土地建设和兴修水利。今年上半年，我们就打了五十八眼水井和两眼电动中型水井，把八百多亩土地变成了水田。在最近召开的庄员代表大会上，我们又决定了农庄五年的水利建设计划，到一九五七年，要把近一万亩的土地变成水田。到了那个时候，我们就基本上可以征服太行山区“十年九旱”的灾害了。
    我们大量地运用着苏联的各项先进农业生产经验。像今年的小麦和秋田作物的密植程度，普遍比去年提高一成，玉米实行了方形种植法，保证了大面积的增产。农庄今年试种的三百多亩杂交玉米，收获量很高。按照苏联农庄通行的定产超额奖励办法，我们今年在各生产队里建立了个人包干负责制，保证了各种作物的及时播种、间苗、中耕和人工授粉。我们学习苏联农庄经营多种经济的方法，今年建立了有牛一百多头的养牛队，扩建了养猪场，准备在明年养猪两千头。还建立了榨油厂，扩大了菜园、果园的栽种面积。此外，根据庄员们修建房屋的需要，农庄建立了石灰窑、砖瓦厂和铁木建筑队。这些副业的收入，每年可以达到十万元。
    今年我们全庄的农业和副业的总收入为四十五万四千多元，比去年增加百分之四十一。每个劳动日的实物报酬，从去年十三斤五两粮食增加到十五斤多；劳动分配的总量，今年比去年提高百分之三十。例如庄员甄兴法，全家三口人，入庄前每年实收入七百七十八斤粮食，今年分得三千零七十三斤粮，还有九十四元现金。除够吃够用外，他还卖给国家一千七百多斤粮食。大部分庄员的情况同甄兴法差不多。因此，庄员们在分粮食的时候，都兴奋地说：集体农庄真是我们幸福的靠山。因为庄员的收入不断增加，所以这两年盖房子的就有一百多户；庄员们的吃穿和家里的摆设也都比过去好了。我们的文化生活也有了很大的提高。全庄已有两座完全小学，五座成人业余学校。业余学校里，设有机械、农业、会计、卫生、畜牧五门专业课程。全庄有四个图书室，订了七十多份报纸和刊物。业余剧团演出了歌唱我们自己生产和生活的节目。农庄的医务人员，经常给庄员检查体格和治疗各种疾病。
    我们生产的不断增长和生活的改善，是因为我们学习了苏联的经验，走上了集体农庄的幸福道路。在纪念十月革命节的时候，我们怀着无限感激的心情，保证要把我们的农庄办得更好，引导广大农民弟兄都逐步走上这条光明大道。
