    Actively and Systematically Carry Out the Agricultural Cooperative Movement
    After Chairman Mao's Report Was Delivered
    Yang Mingjie
    Taizi Township in Xiaogan County, Hubei Province, has a total of 1,117 households and 4,143 people. From the perspective of the work foundation, it is a typical township. Mutual aid teams were organized in 1951, and agricultural production cooperatives began to be established in 1953. Currently, the township has four agricultural cooperatives with 120 members, and 62 mutual aid teams with 520 members. The number of organized households accounts for 57.3% of the total number of households.
    After Chairman Mao’s report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" was disseminated to Taizi Township, the Investigation and Research Office of the Rural Work Department of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China conducted a preliminary survey of 343 poor and middle peasant households in the township regarding their attitudes toward the agricultural cooperative movement. The following situations can be observed:
    A. Poor peasants and some less affluent lower-middle peasants who still have difficulties in production and life—a total of 240 households—have three attitudes toward the agricultural cooperative movement:
    1.  A total of 145 households actively support and firmly demand to join the cooperatives, accounting for 60.5% of the 240 households in the two classes. From their own personal experiences or influenced by the cooperative members, they recognized the superiority of the cooperatives and believed that "the sooner you join, the better. If you don't join the cooperative, it will be like ‘Yu Lao Si celebrating the New Year, getting worse year by year.’" For example, a new lower-middle peasant, Zhang Limu, said: "My individual production is like a beggar woman in confinement, asking for everything but getting nothing; engaging in cooperatives is truly a broad road." They often ask around, "Will the cooperative expand this year?" "Can I join?" However, some of them "want to join the cooperative but are afraid to speak out" because they are too poor, afraid that they cannot afford to join and that people will not accept them, losing face. For example, the poor peasant Zhang Huotian has no cattle or farm tools, no seeds or fertilizer, and all agricultural work has to wait for others to finish before he can do it, unable to seize the opportunity. The land deteriorates year by year. Others harvest more than one stone per dou of land, while he can only harvest four or five dou per dou of land. He doesn't even have enough to eat right now and owes a lot of debt. He applied to join the cooperative several times in the past two years but was not accepted, so he believes he is too poor and people will not want him, and he dares not openly ask to join the cooperative again. Another group of people have a large population, strong labor, and less land. Their income from their own land is not enough to eat. Seeing that the labor remuneration in the cooperative is high, they actively ask to join the cooperative; however, the cooperative does not welcome them. For example, Tang Shengan has eight people, five full laborers and one half laborer, and has applied to join the cooperative several times, but has not been accepted because he has too much labor and too little land (there are more people than land here, and there is a surplus of labor). Another group of people are old, weak, widowed, and childless households with small populations and more land. Seeing that relying on cooperatives can solve the difficulties in production and life, they also actively ask to join the cooperative. For example, Zhang Hababa's mother handed over her land to the cooperative for cultivation last year, and her income increased compared to before. She was very satisfied and felt that she would not have to worry about life after joining the cooperative, and that her son could learn production and be raised by the cooperative. This year, she has repeatedly asked to join the cooperative.
    These people, after hearing Chairman Mao’s report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation," were in an unprecedentedly high mood. Poor peasants generally reflected: Chairman Mao’s policies have arrived, and now we can stand up straight. The poor peasant Liu Zhihai, who dared not speak out after being turned down for joining the cooperative last year, said: "After hearing Chairman Mao's words, I realized that Lao Rao (the cooperative construction cadre) reversed the policy last year. Zhang Yixia and the others (upper-middle peasants) joined the cooperative, but we poor people applied several times and were rejected." Those who were afraid to invest because of excessive difficulties and did not dare to openly ask to join the cooperative, only discussing it behind their backs, are now openly applying to join the cooperative. The poor peasant Zhang Renjiu was originally afraid that the cooperative would not accept him and was not prepared to join; now he asked the deputy secretary of the branch (and cooperative director) overnight: "When will the cooperative expand? Let me know early so I can prepare." The poor peasant Zhang Changhai's mother said: "This time I will climb over the wall to join." Some people are crushing bricks, preparing to build new walls and replace old wall soil with fertilizer to join the cooperative. Some people are actively preparing to marry off their daughters and repay their debts to facilitate joining the cooperative smoothly and wholeheartedly engage in production. Some people are calculating what kind of work they can do after joining the cooperative and how much labor remuneration they can get.
    2.  A total of 84 households hold a wait-and-see attitude, accounting for 35% of the 240 households in the two classes. They basically support cooperation. Some people themselves do not have great difficulties in production and life, and they are not very confident whether joining the cooperative can increase their income. In particular, seeing that the old cooperative has certain shortcomings (such as undemocratic cooperative cadres, corruption, etc.), they have some concerns about joining the cooperative, so they adopt a "wait and see for one or two years" attitude. Some people themselves have some difficulties in production and life (such as a large population and few laborers, etc.), and they are afraid that they will not get many work points after joining the cooperative and their income will decrease. Some people are honest, illiterate, and cannot calculate accounts, and they do not understand the various systems in the cooperative, so they are afraid of suffering losses after joining the cooperative. For these reasons, they say: To be more stable, we will wait two years. There are also some people who have an indifferent attitude towards joining the cooperative: everyone else is rushing to the market, I can't go alone. I'll see where I go. If others join the cooperative, I will join too, and let things take their own course.
    These people are also in a high mood after hearing Chairman Mao’s report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation." Some people have actively asked to join the cooperative. Some people said that they will definitely join the cooperative next year or the year after, and explained the reasons why they cannot join immediately and their main ideological concerns. For example, Zhang Yixin did not join the cooperative in the past because he was too honest and illiterate, and he was afraid that others would miscalculate his work points and reduce his income. After the cooperative cadres explained the specific methods of assessing work and calculating points to him, his ideological concerns were dispelled, and he actively asked to join the cooperative.
    3.  A total of 11 households hold a resistant attitude, accounting for 4.5% of the 240 households in the two classes. Those who hold this attitude are generally people with impure class backgrounds.
    B. Upper-middle peasants with relatively affluent lives—a total of 103 households—have three attitudes toward the cooperative movement:
    1.  A total of 21 households hold a positive attitude, accounting for 20.4% of the 103 households in this class. Most of these people are party members, league members, cadres, activists among the masses, and rising households who have developed in the mutual aid and cooperation movement. They have close political ties with the party and actively support and demand to join the cooperative after hearing Chairman Mao's report.
    2.  A total of 47 households hold a wait-and-see attitude, accounting for 45.6% of the 103 households in this class. These people generally do not understand the mutual aid and cooperation policy very well, or have some misunderstandings. They are afraid of suffering losses after joining the cooperative and plan to wait and see for one or two years. After hearing Chairman Mao's report, although their thinking has changed somewhat, they are still not active in joining the cooperative.
    3.  A total of 35 households hold a resistant attitude, accounting for 34% of the 103 households in this class. These people have a spontaneous tendency towards capitalism and are dissatisfied with the development of cooperatives. Some of them are willing to engage in mutual aid teams but are unwilling to engage in cooperatives, saying that "running cooperatives only benefits the 'ghost cave people' (i.e., poor peasants), and does not benefit us." For example, Zhang Yiguang has a lot of land and little labor, and he needs to hire more than 60 temporary workers every year. In 1951, he served as the leader of the mutual aid team and engaged in disguised exploitation of hired labor within the team. He believes that mutual aid teams are beneficial to him, and cooperatives are detrimental to him, and expresses dissatisfaction with the development of cooperatives. The Tongxin Cooperative in this village increased grain production, and he refused to accept it, insisting that there was no increase in production, and saying that the cooperative's increase in production was deliberately exaggerated by the cadres. However, he is also afraid that others will say that he is backward if he does not join the cooperative, so he pushes it on his father, saying to the staff in this village: "I really want to join the cooperative, but my father is always making noise, so I have to wait until the old man dies." These people are happy in their hearts after hearing Chairman Mao's report, knowing that upper-middle peasants can postpone joining the cooperative. For example, Zhang Lide, who has a relatively serious spontaneous thought, is afraid that others will say he is backward if he does not join the cooperative, and he is not willing to join the cooperative, so he is struggling ideologically. After hearing Chairman Mao's report, he expressed his inner thoughts, saying: "It's true, upper-middle peasants have no difficulty in producing on their own, what is the benefit of going to the cooperative?" However, these people have also generated new anxieties, fearing that they will have no political status in society if they do not join the cooperative, so they superficially show that they actively want to join the cooperative. For example, Zhang Jianghai, a member of a mutual aid team, had seven households in the team join the cooperative last year, leaving him as the only one who did not join the cooperative. Now his wife is testing the staff, saying: "The cooperative is good, but my family's conditions are not good enough (upper-middle peasant). Can I ask to separate from my husband and take my son to join the cooperative?" Tang Ji'an said: "Now there is no inn for merchants to stay in if we move forward, and no village for us to rest in if we retreat, it is really a dilemma."
    While conducting investigations on the peasants, some understanding was also made of the village and township cadres. The vast majority of village and township cadres and cooperative cadres, after hearing Chairman Mao's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation," have confirmed from their own experiences that this report is completely correct. Seeing that the masses were in high spirits after hearing the report, they were also in high spirits themselves, and their confidence in running the cooperative was strengthened. However, some people also generated some complacency, thinking that the masses are highly conscious this year, and the government has cooperative fund loans to support poor peasants joining the cooperative, so cooperatives are easy to run, thus neglecting the ideological mobilization and specific organizational work for the members.
    A few staff members, after hearing Chairman Mao's report, felt that the policy was good, but it was difficult to implement. They said: "If all the poor peasants are absorbed into the cooperative, and the affluent peasants are postponed, what will happen to the poor?" Some people feel that it is a burden for poor peasants to join the cooperative, and they are afraid that they will all come to the cadres to ask for food rations and relief in the spring famine, affecting the consolidation of the cooperative.
    In short, after Chairman Mao’s report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" was disseminated to Taizi Township, the enthusiasm of the peasants, especially the poor peasants, for taking the socialist road rose rapidly. They felt that they could stand up straight, their voices became louder, and they were able to openly raise their demands to join the cooperative and criticize some of the mistakes made by the cadres in implementing policies in the past. However, a small number of poor peasants still have the mistaken understanding of simply relying on government support and taking pride in being poor. It is necessary to strengthen their education and further improve their socialist consciousness. The upper-middle peasants have eliminated the depressed mood of "not wanting to join the cooperative but being afraid of criticism," but they also have new concerns, fearing that others will look down on them if they do not join the cooperative, and that the government will not trust them. To this end, it is necessary to once again explain to the masses the policy of consolidating and uniting with the middle peasants to stabilize the production mood of the upper-middle peasants. The resistant emotions of a few village and township cadres towards absorbing poor peasants into the cooperative must also be overcome by strengthening class policy education. Appropriate criticism must be given to certain cadres who have repeatedly rejected poor peasants from joining the cooperative. Judging from the situation in Taizi Township, to fully realize the spirit of Chairman Mao’s report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation," it is necessary to carry out arduous ideological education work and organizational work.

    积极地有计划地开展农业合作化运动
    毛主席的报告传来以后
    杨明节
    湖北省孝感县太子乡共有一千一百一十七户，四千一百四十三人，从工作基础看，是一个一般乡。一九五一年即有互助组的组织，一九五三年开始建立农业生产合作社。现在全乡共有农业合作社四个，社员一百二十户，互助组六十二个，组员五百二十户。组织起来的户数占总户数的百分之五十七点三。
    毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的报告传达到太子乡后，中共湖北省委农村工作部调查研究室初步调查了这个乡三百四十三户贫农、中农对农业合作化运动的态度，可以看到这样几种情况：
    甲、生产、生活还有困难的贫苦农民和一部分还不富裕的下中农——共有二百四十户，他们对农业合作化运动的态度有三种：
    一、积极拥护，坚决要求入社的有一百四十五户，占两个阶层二百四十户的百分之六十点五。他们从自己切身体会或受到入社农民的影响，认识了合作社的优越性，认为“早入一年，早好一年，再不入社就像‘余老四过年，一年不如一年’”。如新下中农张礼木说：“我单独生产好比讨米婆子在月里（生小孩子），要什么，没什么；搞合作社真是一条大路。”他们经常到处打听“今年合作社扩不扩建”？“我能不能入进去”？但是，他们中间也有少数户“心想入社口难开”，因为自己太穷，怕入不起，怕人家不接受丢人。如贫农张火田，无牛无农具，没种子没肥料，样样农活都要等别人搞了，才能搞，抢不住火色。田一年年变坏，别人一斗田收一石多，他每斗田只能收四、五斗。眼前就没有饭吃，欠债又很多。他前两年曾几次申请入社没有被吸收，所以认为自己太穷，人家不会要，不敢再公开要求入社。还有一部分人，人口多、劳力强、土地较少，单凭自己的土地收入不够吃，看到合作社劳动报酬高，积极要求入社；但是社里不欢迎。如唐胜安八口人，五个全劳动力，一个半劳动力，曾几次申请入社，都因他劳力太多，土地太少未被吸收（此地人多田少，劳力有剩余）。再一部分人是人口少、土地较多、缺乏劳力的老弱孤寡户，他们看到依靠合作社能解决生产生活的困难，也积极要求入社。如张哈吧的妈妈去年把田交给合作社代耕代种，收入比以前增加，非常满意；觉得入了社生活不发愁，儿子可以学习生产，由社教养成人，今年便一再要求入社。
    这些人，听到毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的报告，情绪空前高涨，贫农普遍反映：毛主席的政策来了，这会腰杆子硬了。去年申请入社碰了钉子不敢说话的贫农刘志海说：“听了毛主席的话，才知道去年老饶（建社干部）把政策搞反了，张义侠他们（上中农）入了社，我们穷人申请几次不要。”过去因困难太大，无力投资，不敢公开要求入社、只在背后议论的，现在公开申请入社了。贫农张仁久原来怕社内不要，没准备入社；现在连夜问支部副书记（兼社长）说：“社什么时候扩大，要早些通知一声好准备。”贫农张长海的妈妈说：“这会我翻墙也要入进去。”有的人正在碾砖，准备筑新墙换陈墙土带肥入社。有的人在积极准备嫁姑娘、偿还欠账，以便利利索索地入社，一心一意搞生产。有的在计算自己入社后能做什么活路，能得多少劳动报酬。
    二、抱观望态度的有八十四户，占两个阶层二百四十户的百分之三十五。他们对合作化基本上是拥护的。有的人本身的生产和生活没有很大困难，对于入社能否增加收入没有很大把握，特别是看到老社存在某些缺点（如社干部不民主、贪污等），对入社有些顾虑，因此抱着“看一、二年再说”的态度。有的人本身的生产和生活有一些困难（如人口多劳动力少等），怕入社后得不了多少工分，收入减少。有的为人老实，不识字，不会算账，对社内各种制度搞不清楚，怕入社吃亏。由于这些原因，他们说：为了稳当一些，过两年再说。还有的人对入社抱无所谓的态度：别人都在赶热集，我一个人不能赶冷集，走到哪里看到哪里，别人入社我也入，驼子睡陡坡随歪就歪。
    这些人，现在听了毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的报告，情绪也都很高。有的人已积极要求入社。有的人表示自己一定在明年或后年入社，并说出自己不能马上入社的原因和主要的思想顾虑。如张义新过去不入社，是因为自己为人太老实，又不识字，怕入社后别人把工分计错了减少收入；经过社干部向他解释了评工计分的具体办法，他的思想顾虑解除了，积极要求入社。
    三、抱抵触态度的有十一户，占两个阶层二百四十户的百分之四点五。抱这种态度的一般是成份不纯的人。
    乙、生活比较富裕的上中农——有一百零三户，他们对合作化运动的态度有三种：
    一、抱积极态度的有二十一户，占本阶层一百零三户的百分之二十点四。这种人大部分是党员、团员、干部、群众中的积极分子和在互助合作运动中发展起来的上升户。他们在政治上同党有密切联系，听了毛主席的报告，积极拥护，要求入社。
    二、抱观望态度的有四十七户，占本阶层一百零三户的百分之四十五点六。这种人一般对互助合作政策不大了解，或有些误解，害怕入社吃亏，打算看一、二年再说。他们听了毛主席的报告，虽然思想有些变化，但是对入社还是不积极的。
    三、抱抵触态度的有三十五户，占本阶层一百零三户的百分之三十四。这种人有资本主义的自发倾向，对发展合作社有不满情绪。他们当中有的人愿意搞互助组，不愿搞合作社，说“办合作社只对鬼鬼洞的人（即贫农）有好处，对我们没有什么好处”。如张义光，田地多劳动力较少，每年要请六十个以上的临时工。一九五一年自己当互助组长，在组内进行变相的雇工剥削。他认为互助组对他有好处，合作社对他是不利的，对发展合作社表示不满。本村的同心合作社粮食增了产，他不服气，硬说没有增产，说合作社增产是干部故意吹的。但是，他又怕不入社别人说自己落后，就往父亲身上推，对本村工作人员说：“我真想入社，就是父亲光吵，只好等老头子死了再说。”这些人听了毛主席的报告后，知道上中农可以暂缓入社，内心也满欢喜。如自发思想较为严重的张礼德，不入社怕别人说落后，入社又不是本心情愿，思想斗争得很利害。这会听了毛主席的报告，说出了内心话，他说：“是实在的，上中农自己生产没有困难，搞到社里去有什么益处？”但是，这种人又产生了新的不安，怕不入社在社会上没有政治地位，于是他们表面上表现积极要求入社。如互助组员张江海，去年组里七户入了社，就他一户没入社，现在他老婆来向工作人员试探说：“合作社是好，就是我家条件不够（上中农），我要求和我丈夫分家，带着儿子入社行不行？”唐纪安说：“现在是前进无招商客店，后退无息宿村庄，真是进退两难。”
    在对农民进行调查的同时，对乡村干部也作了些了解。绝大部分乡村干部和社干部听到毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的报告，都从自己的亲身经历中证实这一报告是完全正确的。他们看到群众听了报告以后情绪高涨，自己情绪也很高，增强了办社的信心。但是，也有些人产生了一些自满情绪，认为今年群众觉悟高，政府对贫农入社又有了合作基金贷款扶持，合作社好办了，因而忽视对社员的思想发动和具体组织工作。
    少数工作人员听了毛主席的报告以后，觉得政策好是好，就是难得做到。他们说：“把贫农都吸收到社里来，富裕农民缓入，那穷得一堆了怎么办呢？”有的人感到贫困农民入社是个累赘，怕春荒的时候都来向干部闹口粮，闹救济，影响社的巩固。
    总之，毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的报告传到太子乡以后，农民特别是贫农走社会主义道路的热情迅速高涨，他们感到腰杆子硬了，说话的声音也大了，已经能够公开地提出入社的要求，并批评干部过去执行政策的一些错误。但是，还有少数贫农有单纯依赖政府扶持和以穷为荣的错误认识。必须加强对他们的教育，进一步提高他们的社会主义觉悟。上中农已消除了“不愿入社又怕批评”的苦闷情绪，但又有了怕不入社别人会看不起，政府会不相信等新的顾虑。为此，必须再次向群众说明巩固团结中农的政策，以安定上中农的生产情绪。少数乡村干部对吸收贫农入社所存在的抵触情绪，还必须用加强阶级政策教育的办法，加以克服。对于某些一再排斥贫农入社的干部，必须给予适当的批评。从太子乡的情况看来，要完满实现毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的报告的精神，还必须进行艰苦的思想教育工作和组织工作。
