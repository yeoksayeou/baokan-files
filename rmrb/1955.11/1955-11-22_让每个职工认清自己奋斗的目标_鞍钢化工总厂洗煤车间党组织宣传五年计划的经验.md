    Make Every Employee Recognize Their Struggle Goals
    —The Anshan Iron and Steel Chemical Plant Coal Washing Workshop Party Organization's Experience in Promoting the Five-Year Plan
    He Qing
    In order to effectively promote the First Five-Year Plan among its employees, the Anshan Iron and Steel Chemical Plant Party Committee conducted a pilot program in the coal washing workshop in September. This pilot program proved that the publicity of the Five-Year Plan is a huge political driving force for promoting various practical tasks in the enterprise.
    Before the publicity, the Party Committee, through individual talks, small-scale forums, and participation in various meetings in the coal washing workshop, understood the ideological situation of the employees.
    The investigation and research revealed the following thoughts among the employees: First, the significance of comprehensively launching the increase production and practice economy campaign was not fully understood. Workers like Sun Quanren, when asked how to achieve increased production and economy, replied: "Just do it!" But they couldn't explain how to do it. Some workers were satisfied with small achievements, thinking that "production has reached its peak." Second, they could not correctly understand the relationship between developing production and improving living standards, so they often became emotional due to some immediate life issues. Third, they did not understand the direct relationship between individual completion of production plans and the realization of the national Five-Year Plan. Some people said: "The Five-Year Plan is for the country, it has nothing to do with us." Finally, there was a lack of revolutionary vigilance, and they were not concerned about political incidents within the factory. Some people believed that "as long as we produce well, we can realize the Five-Year Plan," and they did not realize that the realization of the Five-Year Plan is a sharp and complex class struggle.
    Based on the above ideological situation, the coal washing workshop branch determined the following publicity content: 1. The scale and significance of the First Five-Year Plan, with industrial construction as the center; 2. The significance of comprehensively completing the unit's production increase and economy plan for the realization of the Five-Year Plan; 3. The relationship between the realization of the Five-Year Plan and the further improvement of people's living standards; 4. The realization of the Five-Year Plan is a sharp and complex class struggle; 5. Anshan Iron and Steel's arduous tasks in the First Five-Year Plan.
    To do a good job in publicity, it is necessary to have a publicity team. The coal washing workshop branch organized all those who could do publicity work in the coal washing workshop (Party members, League members, propagandists, and activists among the staff), a total of one hundred people, to train them so that they would understand the significance of publicizing the national Five-Year Plan and the content of the publicity. At the end of the training, the branch secretary assigned publicity tasks to them, allowing each propagandist to go among the masses to carry out activities.
    The propagandists' activities were varied. Oral publicity was more effective. Propagandist Jin Guangchun used break time to chat with his fellow workers. He said: "I'll tell you about the origin of 'foreign fire' (matches)." Everyone asked strangely: "What's so good about talking about matches?" He said: "Everyone, tell me, why are they called 'foreign fire' instead of 'firesticks'?" Everyone couldn't answer. So Jin Guangchun said: "In the past, many things in our country had the word 'foreign,' like 'foreign fire,' 'foreign cars,' 'foreign oil,' 'foreign shovels.' Why? Because our country's industry was underdeveloped, and we relied on imports from foreign countries. Foreign imperialists dared to bully us because we had no industry and were not economically independent. Implementing the Five-Year Plan is to lay the foundation for our country's industrialization. After several Five-Year Plans, we will have a large industry, and then we can truly become a rich and strong country." The workers were very excited and said together: "Right! We should take action." Such publicity was very effective. Using one's own familiar events to promote was also welcomed by the masses. Worker Tang Yuzhen used to live on the south bank of the Yellow River and had personally suffered from the Yellow River's disasters, so the branch asked him to tell the story of the Yellow River in conjunction with the national plan to control the Yellow River. The branch also organized people who had been transferred from the Volunteer Army to talk about the heroic struggle of the Volunteer Army in Korea. Everyone was very moved after listening and expressed their determination to overcome various difficulties and strive for the realization of the Five-Year Plan.
    The workshop's blackboard newspapers and newspaper reading groups also became active. During this period, the workshop blackboard newspaper not only publicized the scale and prospects of the Five-Year Plan, but also publicized the workers' actual actions in implementing the Five-Year Plan. After the blackboard newspaper published the news that Gao Jingchen had improved production after studying the Five-Year Plan, the workers in the workshop expressed their desire to learn from Gao Jingchen. The newspaper reading group also selected articles related to the Five-Year Plan to explain to the workers. The workers also automatically composed a quick-clapper rhyme to promote the Five-Year Plan and used their rest time to perform it.
    Publicizing advanced people and advanced ideas set a vivid example for everyone. In the increase production and economy campaign, the workers of coal delivery Team B used their brains to improve their operating methods. Not only did they save the country 1,200 yuan per month, but they could also guarantee timely coal delivery and ensure that the coal tower did not leak. The branch publicized their advanced deeds and pointed out that this was a practical action to study the Five-Year Plan. Other coal delivery teams all learned from Team B. Another example is coal bridge worker Jin Guangchun (a Communist Party member). Although his family burden was relatively heavy and he had some difficulties in life, he never complained, but instead tried to overcome the difficulties. The branch called on everyone to learn from Jin Guangchun's spirit of overcoming difficulties.
    To ensure the correctness of the publicity content and the effectiveness of the publicity, the branch must regularly check the publicity work. The coal washing workshop branch found from the inspection that propagandist Gao Jingchen's publicity effect was very good. He could closely link the Five-Year Plan with everyone's personal interests for publicity. The branch introduced Gao Jingchen's publicity experience at the propagandist conference. The branch also found in the inspection that some propagandists only talked about industry and not about agriculture; or they arbitrarily labeled others in the publicity. The branch also corrected these shortcomings at the propagandist conference.
    After conducting in-depth Five-Year Plan education, the consciousness of the vast number of employees in the coal washing workshop was raised, and their production enthusiasm also increased. At this time, the branch immediately issued a call to all workers to do more work for the First Five-Year Plan, requiring workers to exert greater initiative and creativity in production. At the same time, the branch convened a Party member meeting to review the situation of each Party member in implementing the Five-Year Plan, and called on Communist Party members to become models in implementing the Five-Year Plan. Communist Party members and the masses of workers responded to the Party's call with practical actions. The Han Shaolian group improved the operating methods, and one group replaced the work of two groups. Old worker Wang Fengzhi used his spare time to research a tool fetus for pressing the buckle, increasing work efficiency tenfold. Technician Liu Shumei and economic accountant Sun Zhenyu used the method of adding steam to oil to replace Fushun oil with residual oil, which could save the country more than 300,000 yuan by the end of the year. In September, all six indicators of the entire coal washing workshop completed the plan, and the production plan was completed by 101.5 percent.

    让每个职工认清自己奋斗的目标
　　——鞍钢化工总厂洗煤车间党组织宣传五年计划的经验
　　禾青
    鞍钢化工总厂党委会为了在职工中做好关于第一个五年计划的宣传工作，九月份在洗煤车间进行了试点工作。这次试点工作证明，五年计划的宣传工作是推动企业中各项实际工作的巨大的政治动力。
    在宣传之前，党委在洗煤车间通过个别谈话、开小型座谈会、参加各种会议等方式，了解了职工的思想情况。
    在调查研究中发现职工有这样几种思想：一种思想是对全面开展增产节约运动的意义还了解得不够。工人孙权仁等回答怎样实现增产节约的问题说：“反正干罢！”至于怎么干，却说不上来。也有的工人满足于微小的成绩，认为“生产到顶了”。另一种思想是不能正确地理解发展生产和改善生活的关系，因此，常因眼前生活上一些问题闹情绪。再一种是不了解个人完成生产计划同实现国家五年计划的直接关系，有人说：“五年计划是国家的，同我们没关系。”最后一种是缺乏革命警惕性，对厂内的政治事故不关心，有些人认为“只要好好生产，就能实现五年计划”，还没有认识到实现五年计划是一场尖锐的复杂的阶级斗争。
    洗煤车间支部根据以上几种思想情况，确定了以下几个宣传内容：一、第一个五年计划的规模和意义，工业建设是五年计划的中心；二、全面完成本单位增产节约计划对实现五年计划的意义；三、实现五年计划和进一步提高人民生活水平的关系；四、实现五年计划是一场尖锐的复杂的阶级斗争；五、鞍钢在第一个五年计划中的艰巨任务。
    要做好宣传工作，就得要有一支宣传队伍。洗煤车间支部把洗煤车间所有可以做宣传工作的人（党员、团员、宣传员和工作人员中的积极分子）共一百人组织起来，进行训练，让他们了解宣传国家五年计划的意义和宣传内容。在训练结束的时候，支部书记给他们分配了宣传任务，让每个宣传员到群众中去进行活动。
    宣传员的活动方法是多种多样的。口头宣传的效果比较好。宣传员金广纯就利用工间休息时间和工友们闲谈。他说：“我给大家讲一讲‘洋火’的来历”。大家奇怪地问：“洋火有什么好讲的？”他说：“大家说一说，为什么叫洋火，而不叫火柴？”大家答不上来。于是金广纯说：“我们过去有许多东西都带‘洋’字，像洋火、洋车子、洋油、洋锹，为什么呢？就因为我国工业不发达，一切靠外国进口。外国帝国主义所以敢欺侮我们，也就因为我们没有工业，经济上不能独立。实行五年计划就是给我国工业化打基础，经过几个五年计划，我们就有大工业了，那时候，我们才能真正成为富强的国家。”工友们听了都很兴奋，一齐说：“对！咱们该行动起来。”这样的宣传，效果很好。通过自己熟悉的事现身说法进行宣传，也受到群众的欢迎。工友唐玉珍过去住在黄河南岸，亲身受过黄河的灾害，支部就请他结合国家根治黄河的计划来讲黄河的故事。支部又组织从志愿军转业来的人讲志愿军在朝鲜英勇斗争的事迹。大家听后也都很受感动，表示要克服各种困难，为实现五年计划而斗争。
    车间的黑板报、读报组也活跃起来。在这个期间，车间黑板报不仅宣传了五年计划的规模和远景，也宣传了工人执行五年计划的实际行动。黑板报上登了高静臣学习五年计划后改进生产的消息后，车间工人纷纷表示要向高静臣学习。读报组也选择了有关五年计划的文章向工人讲解。工人还自动编了宣传五年计划的快板，利用休息时间进行演唱。
    宣传先进人物先进思想，给大家树立了活生生的榜样。送煤乙班工友在增产节约运动中开动了脑筋，改进了操作方法，不但每月为国家节省了一千二百元，并且能够保证及时送煤，保证煤塔不漏眼。支部就宣传了他们的这种先进事迹，并且指出这就是学习五年计划的实际行动。其他送煤班就都向乙班学习。又如煤桥工友金广纯（共产党员）虽然家庭负担比较重，生活上有些困难，但他从不叫苦，而是想办法克服困难。支部就号召大家学习金广纯的这种克服困难的精神。
    要保证宣传内容的正确和宣传效果好，支部要经常检查宣传工作情况。洗煤车间支部从检查中发现宣传员高静臣的宣传效果很好，他能把五年计划同每个人的切身利益紧密联系起来进行宣传。支部就在宣传员大会上介绍了高静臣的这个宣传经验。支部在检查中也发现有的宣传员只讲工业，不讲农业；或在宣传中给别人乱扣帽子等。支部也在宣传员大会上纠正了这些缺点。
    进行了深入的五年计划教育后，洗煤车间广大职工的觉悟有了提高，生产的热情也随着提高。这时候，支部紧接着向全体工人提出了为第一个五年计划多做些工作的号召，要求工人们在生产上发挥更大的积极性和创造性。支部同时召开了党员大会，检查了每个党员执行五年计划的情形，号召共产党员要成为执行五年计划的模范。共产党员和职工群众以实际行动回答了党的这个号召。韩少廉小组改进了操作方法，一个组代替了两个小组的工作。老工人王凤志利用业余时间研究出一个压卡子的工具胎，提高工作效率十倍。技术员刘淑梅、经济核算员孙震宇采用油里加蒸气的办法，用残渣油来代替抚顺油，到年底，可为国家节约三十多万元财富。在九月份，整个洗煤车间六种指标都完成了计划，生产计划完成了百分之一百零一点五。
