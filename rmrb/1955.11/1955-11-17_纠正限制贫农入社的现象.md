Correcting the Phenomenon of Restricting Poor Peasants from Joining Cooperatives

    Restricting poor peasants from joining cooperatives is still a relatively serious problem in the current agricultural cooperativization movement. According to the report of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee in the first half of October, in Beishanggao Township, Tai'an County, some poor peasants applied several times but were not approved to join the cooperative. Of the 122 poor peasant households in Beishanggao Village in this township that had not joined the cooperative, 98 were refused entry, and the rest were squeezed out after joining. Fu Yuhui, a poor peasant from Milu Township, Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province, recently publicly accused Wang Yirun, the leader of the work team, of preventing him from joining the cooperative in the Shaanxi Daily.
    Who would oppose poor peasants joining cooperatives? Obviously, rich peasants and former landlords are the most staunchly opposed to poor peasants. Therefore, if landlords, rich peasant elements, or bad elements colluding with landlords and rich peasants control the cooperative, this cooperative will definitely restrict poor peasants from joining. Some well-to-do middle peasants also restrict poor peasants; they believe that being in a cooperative with poor peasants would be disadvantageous and that poor peasants would take advantage of them. In fact, when poor peasants join cooperatives, they can certainly get help from middle peasants in terms of livestock and farm tools, but middle peasants can also get help from poor peasants in terms of labor. This help is based on mutual benefit. No one suffers, and no one takes advantage. If one insists on saying "take advantage," then everyone takes advantage. A small number of cadres from well-to-do middle peasant backgrounds, or cadres who ideologically lean towards well-to-do middle peasants, also restrict poor peasants. They believe that with livestock and farm tools, the cooperative can be run well. But they don't understand that even without livestock and farm tools, the cooperative can still be run well. Why? Because the key lies in whether there is socialist enthusiasm in people; with people's socialist enthusiasm, relying on the hard work of the masses and the leadership and help of the People's Government, the cooperative can be run well. Conversely, if there are only livestock and farm tools, but no socialist enthusiasm in people, then the cooperative will definitely not be run well. The livestock and farm tools of rich peasants are even better than those of middle peasants, but they just can't run a good cooperative (of course, they wouldn't run a real cooperative anyway). If well-to-do middle peasants do not have socialist enthusiasm, even if their livestock and farm tools are relatively good, they will not be able to run the cooperative well, or they will always be hesitant and cause disunity. Poor peasants have socialist enthusiasm, so even if they don't have livestock and farm tools, or their livestock and farm tools are not good, they can still run the cooperative well. For example, in Nancuizhuang Village, Anyang County, Henan Province, there are two cooperatives, one led by poor peasants and one led by well-to-do middle peasants. Although the cooperative led by poor peasants had great material difficulties at the time, as some people said they were a "carrying pole team, grasshopper donkeys," and a "poor big cooperative," because this cooperative insisted on implementing the Party's cooperativization policy, especially the policy of "running the cooperative diligently and thriftily," this cooperative developed from a small cooperative of eighteen poor households into a large cooperative of eighty-eight households. And the cooperative led by well-to-do middle peasants, although their livestock and farm tools were complete and good, did not run well because the leaders had capitalist ideas, and finally had to merge with the cooperative led by poor peasants. Doesn't this living fact explain who can run a cooperative and who cannot?

    To stop the phenomenon of excluding poor peasants, Party committees at all levels must repeatedly and tirelessly educate their cadres on the Party's class policy, so that these cadres understand that poor peasants are the most resolute supporters of the Party's policies, especially the policy of agricultural cooperativization, and are therefore the class force on which the Party relies to carry out the socialist transformation of agriculture. In the past, the Party relied on poor peasants to achieve great victories; in the transition to the socialist revolution, this revolutionary struggle is even more profound and complex than the previous revolutionary struggle, and it is even more necessary to rely on poor peasants. At the same time, only by relying on poor peasants first and placing poor peasants in a backbone position can we consolidate the unity of middle peasants. Party committees at all levels should also tell them that when going deep into grassroots organizations to solve the problem of restricting poor peasants, they must first find out who is restricting poor peasants? If landlords and rich peasants have infiltrated the cooperative, they must be resolutely expelled from the cooperative. If they are members of rich middle peasant backgrounds, these members should be patiently persuaded and educated. If members of rich middle peasant backgrounds are dominant in the cooperative, the cooperative should be rectified and reorganized to establish the dominance of poor and lower-middle peasants. If cadres are restricting poor peasants because they are influenced by the ideas of landlords and rich peasants, these cadres should be severely criticized, and even their jobs should be revoked. If cadres of rich middle peasant backgrounds are restricting poor peasants, they should be educated to recognize and correct their mistakes.

    For Party grassroots organizations that severely restrict poor peasants from joining cooperatives, organizational rectification work must also be carried out. In Party rectification, the focus should be on examining the class viewpoint of this organization and its members and the implementation of the Party's class policy. Now there are indeed many Party members whose thinking has changed because their economic situation has changed. These Party members not only do not uphold the Party's class policy, but also arbitrarily undermine the Party's class policy. It should be pointed out to these people that their actions are not worthy of being a Party member, and they must immediately correct the mistake of excluding poor peasants. Those who persist in this error should be punished, even expelled from the Party. Class aliens and other bad elements who have infiltrated the Party organization to deliberately provoke relations between poor and middle peasants should be resolutely expelled from the Party.

    Many places have also used vivid facts to make grassroots cadres and members, especially cadres and members of middle peasant backgrounds, understand that in the cooperativization movement, it is necessary to rely on poor peasants and consolidate the unity of middle peasants. For example, the middle peasant members of the Gan Tang Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yongning, Guangxi, always said that the poor peasant members were taking advantage of them, and there was a mood of excluding poor peasant members. The work team stationed in the cooperative calculated the income accounts of middle peasant member Liu Zhenlong and poor peasant member Su Yongkang for everyone. Liu Zhenlong had four laborers and more than 29 mu of land. Before joining the cooperative, each laborer had to bear more than 7 mu of land on average, and they were too busy to handle it, so they planted sparsely and cultivated very crudely. As a result, last year's early rice, excluding investment, had a total income of 6,000 jin of rice. This year, after joining the cooperative, each laborer only bears 3.5 mu of land on average, but received 7,327 jin of rice (including land dividends), which is 1,327 jin more than last year. Su Yongkang had two laborers and 9.4 mu of land. Before joining the cooperative, the family's income was 1,070 jin of rice. This year, after joining the cooperative, he can receive 2,840 jin of rice, which is 1,770 jin more than last year. This shows that the increased production of the cooperative is the result of the joint efforts of poor and middle peasants. In this way, the middle peasant members of the Gan Tang Township Agricultural Production Cooperative can truly work together with the poor peasant members to run the cooperative.

    When dealing with economic issues in the cooperative, the principle of mutual benefit must be adhered to. Because poor peasants and middle peasants have different economic conditions, they have different opinions on many economic issues. When dealing with these issues, the interests of poor peasants must be taken into account without harming the interests of middle peasants. It is absolutely impossible to harm the interests of middle peasants in order to take care of poor peasants; nor is it possible to harm the interests of poor peasants in order to cater to middle peasants. When dealing with these specific issues, the method of consultation should also be adopted. If one consultation cannot solve the problem, several more consultations can be held. Many areas have adopted this method when solving the problem of labor and land dividends or the problem of joining the cooperative, and the results have been very good.

    To establish the dominant position of poor peasants in the cooperative, Party leading organs and Party grassroots organizations must also do a lot of practical work. Of course, first of all, we must try to absorb poor peasants into the cooperative, ensure that poor peasant members occupy a majority in the leadership structure of the cooperative, and continuously provide various specific assistance to poor peasant leading cadres to effectively improve their working abilities. In some cooperatives, poor peasant members have already taken control of the leadership, but because poor peasant leading cadres have difficulties in life or other aspects, they cannot do the leadership work of the cooperative well. This requires Party leading organs and Party grassroots organizations to find ways to help them overcome their difficulties; there are also a few poor peasant leading cadres who are too weak and cannot bear their current positions, so timely re-elections should be held to select capable poor peasant members to take on leadership work. Only in this way can the advantage of poor peasants be truly established. Otherwise, the phenomenon of "poor peasants sitting in the court, middle peasants in power" will occur.

    However, while criticizing and correcting the phenomenon of restricting poor peasants, we must prevent the phenomenon of excluding middle peasants from joining cooperatives. In fact, this phenomenon has already occurred. For example, upper-middle peasants are not included in the overall plan for developing members, upper-middle peasants who truly voluntarily want to join the cooperative are refused, or upper-middle peasants are subjected to intimidating propaganda, such as saying "You used to be naughty, but now we don't want you," or even putting upper-middle peasants together with landlords and rich peasants. This is equally completely wrong and extremely dangerous. Comrade Mao Zedong made it very clear in his report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperativization": "...All middle peasants with relatively affluent economic status, except for some who have already become aware of the socialist road and truly voluntarily join cooperatives, can be absorbed into cooperatives, while the rest should not be absorbed for the time being, let alone be forced to pull them in. This is because they have not yet become aware of the socialist road, and only when the majority of people in the countryside have joined cooperatives, or when the unit area yield of cooperatives has increased to be equal to or even higher than the unit area yield of these affluent middle peasants, and they feel that continuing to work individually is detrimental to them in all aspects, and only joining cooperatives is more beneficial, will they be determined to join cooperatives." This not only shows that upper-middle peasants who truly voluntarily want to join cooperatives should be absorbed into cooperatives now, but also shows that the attitude of upper-middle peasants towards cooperativization will change with the development of the cooperativization movement. At the beginning of establishing cooperatives, it is one attitude, and when the entire village is cooperativized, it is another attitude; when the unit area yield of cooperatives is not higher than that of upper-middle peasants, it is one attitude, and when the unit area yield of cooperatives is higher than that of upper-middle peasants, it is another attitude. Leaders of the cooperativization movement must be good at adopting different methods to treat upper-middle peasants according to different situations, so that they will neither force them to join the cooperative nor force them not to join the cooperative. Only in this way can the alliance with middle peasants be consolidated.

    The Party's class policy is unified and indivisible and must be fully implemented. Any attempt to emphasize one aspect and weaken the other is wrong.

### 纠正限制贫农入社的现象

　　纠正限制贫农入社的现象
    限制贫农入社，还是目前农业合作化运动中的一个比较严重的问题。根据中共山东省委十月上半月的报告，泰安县北上高乡有的贫农连续申请几次没有被批准入社。这个乡的北上高村没有入社的一百二十二户贫农中，有九十八户是被拒绝入社，其余的是入社后又被排挤出社的。陕西省长安县糜鹿乡贫农傅玉惠最近在陕西日报上，公开控告了不让他入社的工作组组长王益润。
    什么人会反对贫农入社呢？很明显，富农和过去的地主是最坚决反对贫农的。因此，如果地主富农分子或者和地主富农分子有勾结的坏分子，把持了合作社，这个合作社一定限制贫农入社。部分富裕中农也会限制贫农；他们认为同贫农在一个合作社，就会吃亏，贫农会占他们的便宜。其实，贫农参加了合作社，固然可以得到中农在牲口、农具方面的帮助，但是中农也可以得到贫农在劳动力方面的帮助，这种帮助是建立在互利的基础上的。谁也不吃亏，谁也不占便宜。如果硬要说“占便宜”，那么谁都占了便宜。少数富裕中农成分的干部，或者思想上偏向富裕中农的干部也限制贫农。他们认为只要有了牲口、农具，就可以办好合作社。但是他们不懂得没有牲口、农具，同样可以办好合作社。为什么呢？因为问题的关键在于有没有人的社会主义积极性；有了人的社会主义积极性，依靠群众的努力劳动和人民政府的领导帮助，就可以办好社。相反的，如果光有牲口、农具，而没有人的社会主义积极性，那就一定办不好合作社。富农的牲口、农具比中农的牲口、农具还好，但就是办不好合作社（当然，他们也不会去办真的合作社）。富裕中农如果没有社会主义的积极性，即使牲口、农具比较好，也办不好合作社，办起来也要老是三心二意，闹不团结。贫农有社会主义积极性，因此，他们即使没有牲口、农具，或者牲口、农具不好，还是能办好合作社。举个例子：河南省安阳县南崔庄有两个合作社，一个是由贫农领导的，一个是由富裕中农领导的。贫农领导的社虽然当时物质上的困难很大，正如有人说他们是“扁担队，蚂蚱驴”，是“穷大社”，但因为这个社坚持执行了党的合作化方针，特别是“勤俭办社”的方针，这个社就由贫困的十八户的小社，发展成为八十八户的大社。而那个富裕中农领导的社，虽然牲口、农具很齐很好，但因为领导人有资本主义思想，社就办得不好，最后不得不跟贫农领导的社合并。这个活生生的事实，难道还不能说明谁能办社，谁不能办社吗？
    要停止排斥贫农的现象，各级党委就要反复地、不厌其烦地对自己的干部进行党的阶级政策的教育，使这些干部懂得贫农是农村中最坚决拥护党的政策特别是农业合作化政策的，因而也是党所依靠来对农业进行社会主义改造的阶级力量。党在过去，依靠贫农，取得了伟大的胜利；在转入社会主义革命时期，这个革命斗争又比前一个革命斗争更加深刻，更加复杂，就更加需要依靠贫农。同时，也只有首先依靠了贫农，把贫农放在骨干地位上，才能巩固地团结中农。各级党委还要告诉他们，在深入基层组织解决限制贫农问题的时候，首先要弄清究竟是什么人在限制贫农？如果是地主、富农钻入了合作社，就要坚决把地主、富农清洗出社。如果是富裕中农成分的社员，就要耐心地对这些社员进行说服教育，如果富裕中农成分的社员在合作社内占了优势，就应该整顿和改组这个合作社，建立起贫农和下中农的优势；如果是因为干部受到了地主、富农思想影响在限制贫农，就应该对这些干部进行严厉的批评，甚至撤销他们的工作；如果是富裕中农成分的干部在限制贫农，便应该对他们进行教育，使他们认识和改正自己的错误。
    对于严重地限制贫农入社的党的基层组织，还必须进行整顿组织的工作。在整党中，要着重检查这个组织和党员的阶级观点和执行党的阶级政策的情形。现在确有不少党员，因为自己的经济情况有了变化，思想也有了变化，这些党员不仅不维护党的阶级政策，而且任意破坏党的阶级政策。就要给这些人指出，像他们的这种作法，是不配作一个党员的，必须立即改正排斥贫农的错误。对于坚持这种错误的人，就应该给以处分，直至开除党籍。对于混入党组织来有意挑拨贫农中农关系的阶级异己分子和其他坏分子，就要坚决驱逐出党。
    许多地方还通过生动的事实，使基层干部和社员特别是中农成分的干部和社员，懂得了在合作化运动中，必须依靠贫农，巩固地团结中农。例如：广西邕宁甘棠乡农业生产合作社的中农社员总说贫农社员沾了他们的光，有排斥贫农社员的情绪。驻社工作组就给大家算了一下中农社员刘振龙和贫农社员苏永康的收入账。刘振龙有四个劳动力，二十九亩多田，入社前，平均每个劳动力要负担七亩多田，忙不过来，大株稀植，耕作很粗糙。结果，去年早造稻除投资外，总收入六千斤谷子；今年入社后，平均每个劳动力只负担三亩半田，但分到了七千三百二十七斤谷子（包括土地分红在内），比去年多收入一千三百二十七斤谷子。苏永康有两个劳动力，九亩四分田，入社前，全家收入一千零七十斤谷子；今年入社后，可分二千八百四十斤谷子，比去年多收入一千七百七十斤谷子。这就说明了，合作社增产是贫农和中农共同努力的结果。这样，甘棠乡农业生产合作社的中农社员，真正能够同贫农社员齐心协力办社了。
    在处理社里的经济问题的时候，必须坚持互利的原则。因为贫农和中农的经济条件不同，在许多经济问题上，是有不同的意见的。在处理这些问题的时候，既要照顾贫农利益，又要不损害中农利益。决不能为了照顾贫农，而去损害中农利益；也不能为了迁就中农，而去损害贫农利益。在处理这些具体问题时，还要采用协商的方法。协商一次不能解决，可以多协商几次。许多地区在解决劳力和土地分红问题或入社资金问题的时候，都采取了这个办法，结果都很好。
    要树立贫农在合作社内的优势地位，党的领导机关和党的基层组织还必须做许多实际工作。当然，首先要设法吸收贫农入社，要使贫农社员在社的领导机构中占多数，对贫农领导骨干要不断地进行各种具体帮助，有效地提高他们的工作能力。在有些社里，贫农社员已经掌握了领导权，但因为贫农领导骨干有生活困难或其他方面的困难，不能很好地做社的领导工作，这就要党的领导机关和党的基层组织设法帮助他们克服困难；也有少数贫农领导骨干能力太弱，实在担负不起现在的职务，这就要及时进行改选，另选有能力的贫农社员来担任领导工作。只有这样，才能真正树立起贫农优势。否则，就会产生“贫农坐朝，中农当权” 的现象。
    但是，在批判和纠正限制贫农现象的同时，必须防止排斥中农入社的现象。事实上，这种现象也已经发生了。例如在发展社员的全面规划中没有把上中农包括进去，对真正自愿入社的上中农拒绝接收入社，或者对上中农进行恐吓性的宣传，如说“从前你们调皮，现在不要你们了”，甚至把上中农同地主、富农放在一道。这同样是完全错误和十分危险的。毛泽东同志在“关于农业合作化问题”的报告中，已经说得很清楚：“……一切经济地位较为富裕的中农，除开若干已经有了走社会主义道路的觉悟、真正自愿加入合作社的，可以吸收他们入社以外，其余暂时都不要吸收，更不要勉强地把他们拉进来。这是因为他们现在还没有走社会主义道路的觉悟，只有等到农村中大多数人都加入合作社了，或者合作社的单位面积产量提高到同这些富裕中农的单位面积产量相等甚至更高了，他们感到再单干下去在各方面都对他们不利，而唯有加入合作社才是较为有利的时候，他们才会下决心加入合作社。”这不仅说明了对真正自愿入社的上中农现在就应该吸收入社，而且说明了上中农对合作化的态度是会随着合作化运动的发展而变化的。在开始建立合作社的时候是一种态度，在已经全村合作化的时候又是一种态度；在合作社的单位面积产量不高于上中农的时候是一种态度，在合作社的单位面积产量高于上中农的时候又是一种态度。合作化运动的领导者必须善于根据不同情况，采取不同的方法来对待上中农，做到既不要勉强他们入社，又不要勉强他们不入社，这才能巩固同中农的联合。
    党的阶级政策是统一不可分割的，必须全面地贯彻执行，任何强调一方面、削弱另一方面的企图都是错误的。
