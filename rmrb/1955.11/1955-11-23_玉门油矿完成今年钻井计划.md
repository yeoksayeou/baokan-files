　　Yumen Oil Mine Completes This Year's Drilling Plan

　　The dozens of petroleum drilling teams at the Yumen Oil Mine have already completed this year's drilling plan ahead of schedule on November 20. This year, the Yumen Oil Mine's drilling task increased by one-third compared to last year, which is equal to fifteen times that of 1952. This year, the drilling team workers vigorously promoted the advanced experience of Soviet rapid drilling, established and improved the production command system, which increased drilling efficiency by more than 30%. The Wang Hualan drilling team also created a new record of advancing 370 meters per day. Drilling costs have also been reduced month by month. The expenses saved in the third quarter alone can be used to drill 6,840 meters of production wells. (Xinhua News Agency)

　  玉门油矿完成今年钻井计划
    玉门油矿的几十个石油钻井队已经在十一月二十日提前完成今年的钻井计划。今年玉门油矿的钻井任务比去年增加三分之一，等于一九五二年的十五倍。钻井队职工们今年大力推广苏联快速钻井的先进经验，建立和健全了生产指挥制度，使钻井效率提高百分之三十以上。王化兰钻井队还创造了日进三百七十公尺的新纪录。钻井成本也逐月降低，只是在第三季度节省的费用，就可以用来钻凿生产井六千八百四十公尺。（新华社）
