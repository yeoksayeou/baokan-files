Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, November 14th: Indonesian President Sukarno said on the 13th that imperialists continue to constantly threaten the Republic of Indonesia. He said, "There will always be a conflict of interest between us and the imperialists."

Sukarno said, "The people must rise up and fight against imperialism. We are not isolated in this struggle. With us are the countries of Asia and Africa."

President Sukarno made these remarks at a red and white flag mass rally convened by the All-Indonesia People's Congress in Bandung. 1.5 million people attended the rally. The rally was originally scheduled to be held a month and a half ago but was then banned by the Indonesian cabinet.

Sukarno said that the current task of the Indonesian people is to carry the national revolution through to the end through organized people's power and national power, rather than through "begging" or "pleading." He called on the people to consolidate national unity, fight against the separatist armed bandits who disrupt public order in West Java and other places, strive to establish a prosperous and just society, and fight to recover West Irian and defend the unified Republic of Indonesia, from Sabang to Merauke, which was declared on August 17, 1945. Speaking of West Irian, he said, "We are determined to do our utmost to liberate it."

He said, "The imperialists have not been able to destroy our spirit. Through lasting trials, we have maintained our revolutionary traditions and continue to fight for our complete independence. We are following the revolutionary path. The revolutionary unity of the people must be strengthened daily. This is extremely important because the danger has not passed."

The masses participating in the rally held at Tigaraja Square held thousands of red and white national flags and many slogans calling for national unity. Astra Winata, chairman of the All-Indonesia People's Congress West Java Branch and chairman of the conference, pointed out in his opening remarks that the participants included nationalists, religious believers, and communists, which proves that the people are united for a common ideal.

Prior to this, President Sukarno delivered a speech to 250,000 people at a mass rally in Cimanggis, near Bandung, on the 12th. Regarding the slogan held up by the masses: "Long live the cooperation of nationalists, religious believers, and Marxists!" President Sukarno said: This slogan is correct and in line with the actual situation, because the realization of Indonesia's independence was not achieved solely by nationalists, religious believers, or Marxists, but by the joint efforts of all the people.

President Sukarno also pointed out the importance of national unity in the upcoming Constituent Assembly elections. He called on voters to elect parties that fought for the complete independence of the country.

　　苏加诺号召印度尼西亚人民进行反帝斗争
    据新华社雅加达十四日电　印度尼西亚总统苏加诺十三日说，帝国主义者继续不断地威胁着印度尼西亚共和国。他说：“我们和帝国主义者之间永远存在着利益上的矛盾。”
    苏加诺说：“人民必须振起进行反对帝国主义的斗争。我们在这个斗争中不是孤立的。同我们在一起的有亚洲和非洲的国家。”
    苏加诺总统是在全印度尼西亚人民代表大会在万隆召集的红白旗群众大会上说这些话的。参加这个大会的有一百五十万人。这个大会原定在一个半月以前举行，当时曾被印度尼西亚内阁禁止。
    苏加诺说，印度尼西亚人民目前的任务是要通过有组织的人民力量和国家力量，而不是通过“乞讨”或“恳求”来把民族革命贯彻到底。他号召人民巩固全民团结，同西爪哇和其他地方的分裂团结、扰乱治安的武装匪帮进行斗争，努力争取建立繁荣和公正的社会，为收回西伊里安和保卫一九四五年八月十七日宣布成立的从萨斑到美劳开的统一的印度尼西亚共和国而斗争。他在谈到西伊里安时说，“我们决心竭尽我们的全力解放它。”
    他说：“帝国主义者并没有破坏得了我们的精神，通过持久的考验，我们保持了我们的革命传统，并且继续为我们的完全独立而斗争。我们正在遵循着革命的道路。必须每日加强人民的革命团结。这是极端重要的，因为危险还没有过去。”
    参加在蒂加拉加广场举行的大会的群众，高举着成千幅红白国旗和许多号召全民团结的标语。大会主席、全印度尼西亚人民代表大会西爪哇分会主席阿斯特拉文纳塔致开会词时指出，参加大会的人中包括有民族主义者、宗教信徒和共产党人，这证明人民为了共同的理想而团结一致。
    在这以前，苏加诺总统十二日曾在万隆附近双木丹的一个群众大会上向二十五万人发表演说。苏加诺总统就群众所高举着的标语：“民族主义者、宗教信徒和马克思主义者合作万岁！”说：这个标语是正确的，而且是符合实际情况的，因为印度尼西亚的独立的实现不是单独依靠民族主义者、宗教信徒或是马克思主义者的，而是全体人民共同奋斗的结果。
    苏加诺总统还指出了在即将举行的制宪议会选举中民族团结的重要性。他号召选民选举为国家的完全独立而斗争的政党。
