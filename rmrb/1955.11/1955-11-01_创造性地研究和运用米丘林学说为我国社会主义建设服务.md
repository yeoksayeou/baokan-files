    Creatively Study and Apply Michurin's Theories to Serve Our Country's Socialist Construction
    Tong Dizhou, Deputy Director of the Department of Biology and Geosciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences

    October 27th of this year marks the 100th anniversary of the birth of Ivan Vladimirovich Michurin. It is of great significance that we hold an academic commemorative meeting today with reverence.

    Michurin was an outstanding Soviet biologist and a great transformer of nature. With his brilliant work, he creatively developed Darwinism, bringing materialistic biology to a new and higher stage.

    Throughout the historical development of biology, there has been a constant ideological struggle between materialism and idealism. In recent decades, two directions have formed in biological science: one is the materialistic Michurin direction, and the other is the idealistic Weismann-Morgan direction. At the August 1948 session of the All-Union Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Michurinists, led by Lysenko, thoroughly exposed the theoretical errors and practical ineffectiveness of Weismann-Morganism based on irrefutable facts, defended and developed Michurin's theories, and further powerfully demonstrated the extremely significant role of Michurin's theories in the development of biological science and agricultural production.

    Michurin's theories were developed on the basis of dialectical materialism. The basic idea of Michurin's theories is the unity of an organism and its living conditions. It proves, through countless experiments, the scientific truth that acquired characteristics can be inherited, elucidates the stages of plant development and the essence of vitality and fertilization, and then proposes that humans can directionally change the nature of organisms and cultivate new varieties of plants and animals that meet human requirements. Michurin's theories changed the face of biological science. Michurin's theories are not only the theoretical basis of agricultural science but also the theoretical basis of all other biological sciences.

    The great power of Michurin's theories lies in their close connection with life and practical production. According to Michurin's theories, humans can more actively and consciously control the development and growth of organisms. Under the Soviet system, Michurin's theories became the wealth of all Soviet people and an indispensable and powerful weapon for the Soviet Union to develop socialist agricultural production. At the same time, socialist agriculture has created superior conditions for the development of Michurin's theories, developing Michurin's theories. Now, not only Soviet biologists, including the vast number of state farm workers and collective farm members, are working under the guidance of Michurin's theories, but this theory has also been accepted by advanced biologists all over the world.

    The founding of the People's Republic of China has created favorable conditions for the wide dissemination of Michurin's theories in our country. In the past six years, a nationwide upsurge in studying and learning Michurin's theories has formed. Many Soviet biologists have come to our country to investigate and give lectures. A large number of relevant works have been translated and published. Michurin's theories training courses and teaching classes have been held in Beijing and many provinces and regions. Many biologists, agronomists, and young students have systematically studied and learned Michurin's theories with great enthusiasm. Michurin's name has even spread to the vast countryside, and many farmers have organized Michurin technology groups. This is playing a positive role in improving our agricultural technology and developing agricultural production.

    In the past six years, many biological science workers have gradually realized the harm of Weismann-Morganism and the correctness of Michurin's theories through their own research and study. We have done some work in changing living conditions to cause directional variation in organisms. For example, according to the theory of stage development, several spring wheat varieties have been successfully changed into winter wheat, which can overwinter in severe cold conditions of minus 30 degrees, opening up a path for further creation of overwintering cold-resistant types of various crops. By using the method of high-temperature education, the adaptability of yeast to high temperatures has been continuously improved, and a high-temperature type of yeast that can develop normally at 40 degrees Celsius has been preliminarily cultivated, which can increase the production of alcohol. The rabbitized rinderpest virus has been inoculated through sheep, changing the heredity of the virus, thereby improving the nature of the vaccine, and a rinderpest virus vaccine suitable for yaks in the Northwest and Southwest regions has been made, which has curbed the epidemic of rinderpest in many pastoral areas. These examples convince us of Michurin's words: "Due to human intervention, it is possible to change each form of plant and animal faster and in the direction that humans desire," and at the same time make us realize the falsity of Weismann-Morganism's so-called "permanence" and "immutability" of genetic material.

    The theory of plant stage development is an important development of Michurin's theories by Lysenko. This theory points out that the characteristics and properties of an organism are formed on the basis of stage development. It shattered the idealistic erroneous hypotheses of "photoperiod" and "flowering hormone" in plant physiology. Inspired by the theory of plant stage development, we have conducted research on the formation of plant characteristics and properties. In the past few years, we have also conducted a series of studies on the analysis of plant stage development. We have a preliminary understanding of the stage development characteristics of crops such as rice, wheat, cotton, soybeans, and garlic, as well as their relationship with natural conditions, providing a scientific basis for breeding and cultivation work. For example, general upland cotton varieties can mature earlier and increase pre-frost flower yield after vernalization treatment, pointing out the importance of promoting vernalization treatment in production. After the jointing of spring wheat in the spring of 1953 and 1954, frost damage occurred in many regions across the country. Due to some understanding of the development characteristics of wheat varieties, a remedy of irrigation and fertilization was proposed, and the damaged wheat was not plowed and replanted with autumn crops, reducing not small losses.

    The work of asexual grafting in the past few years has also eloquently proved that the "chromosome inheritance theory" is wrong, making us realize that any living part of an organism has heredity. In the grafting work of Solanaceae plants, some genetic phenomena of its characteristics and properties have been preliminarily explored. In the asexual grafting research of sea island cotton and upland cotton, directional cultivation is carried out under the education of upland cotton, so that sea island cotton can flower two months earlier, so that sea island cotton can be cultivated in our cotton area, and conditions are provided for the selection of long-staple cotton varieties. The research on asexual hybridization of trees and poultry has also been preliminarily carried out, opening up new avenues for the selection of trees and poultry.

    Using the theory of sexual hybridization and selective fertilization in Michurin's theories, we have started some research work on sexual hybridization breeding and improving seed viability, destroying idealistic theories such as the "pure line theory" with practical research results. The hybrids of Zhongmian and Upland cotton, which were originally considered to have no hope of breeding, have now become valuable breeding materials, and may become new cotton seeds after years of cultivation. By adopting the method of complex hybridization of Xinjiang "Kazakh" sheep and Soviet "Caucasian" sheep, Xinjiang sheep with both wool and meat have been cultivated. Compared with our country's "Mongolian", "Tibetan" and "Kazakh" sheep, this kind of sheep weighs more than 45% more, and the wool yield is more than six times more, which can be used as a textile raw material for 60 counts of fine wool. The results of research on improving the viability of seeds of several major crops show that it is possible for us to obtain effective methods to solve the phenomenon of variety degradation and improve its quality and yield. The research work on mixed sperm hybridization of silkworms refutes the false theory of Weismann-Morganism about fertilization.

    In summarizing the production knowledge of the vast number of farmers, we have also applied Michurin's theories and discovered many valuable advanced experiences. The promotion of these experiences has played a significant role in increasing agricultural production. The achievements of Qu Yaoli, a national cotton high-yield model worker, in selecting large boll seeds can be said to be an unimaginable miracle under the "theory" of "pure line theory".

    Under the influence of Michurin's theories, we have effectively improved production technology in the past few years. We have systematically sorted out farm varieties nationwide and selected many excellent varieties and populations from them, and promoted the rational close planting of crops such as rice, wheat, and cotton, artificial auxiliary pollination of corn, and economic hybridization of livestock. The annual increase in cotton fields in the Manas River Basin of Xinjiang is an example of the great significance of creatively applying Michurin's theories to the development of agricultural production. In the past few years, according to Michurin's domestication theory, we are carrying out a large-scale work of expanding tropical resource plants to the north, and starting the domestication of foreign livestock breeds.

    From some of the facts listed above, it can be seen that we have achieved certain results in studying and researching Michurin's theories in the past six years. Biologists, agronomists, including researchers at research institutes, school teachers, and practical workers in production positions, have done a lot of work in this regard in various regions and at various work posts. The acquisition of these achievements has laid a preliminary foundation for the development of biological science in our country.

    Our initial achievements, like the vigorous development of Michurin's theories in the Soviet Union, are inseparable from the leadership and support of the Communist Party and the government. The series of policies of the Communist Party and the government on scientific work are the guarantee that scientific work can develop and effectively serve national construction.

    Our country is currently carrying out a great socialist construction. Not only is industry developing vigorously, but also the high tide of agricultural cooperation will arrive nationwide. Biologists and agronomists across the country should actively study Michurin's theories, and under the guidance of Michurin's theories, make more and better achievements in scientific work, so that our country's agricultural production can adapt to the needs of industrialization and rapidly improve. In the past six years, the vast majority of biologists and agronomists in our country have been enthusiastic and active in studying Michurin's theories. The above achievements fully illustrate this point. We believe that in the high tide of agricultural cooperation, everyone will be more enthusiastic and active in studying Michurin's theories and make more achievements in scientific work. However, there are still some people in the biological community who adhere to Mendel-Morganism and adopt a blind opposition attitude towards Michurin's theories. Individual people completely ignore Michurin's theories in his research work, do not mention Michurin in his biological works, and do not conduct academic debates with a scientific attitude, but deliberately use the academic disputes of Soviet scientists on the issue of species, and use the different academic views of some Soviet biologists on Lysenko on the issue of species to belittle the significance of Michurin's theories and distort the correct policy of the Soviet Communist Party on scientific undertakings, saying that when Lysenko's new views on species were first published, they were popular for a while due to the support of political forces, but soon aroused criticism from the academic community, and most of Lysenko's arguments were denied, etc. It is quite obvious that this argument is completely inconsistent with the facts. Our biological workers must have a very profound understanding of this, so as not to be led astray. Everyone knows that the Soviet Communist Party (as is the Chinese Communist Party) has always given great care to the development of scientific undertakings. The Communist Party constantly provides scientists with Marxist-Leninist ideological armaments, and creates the necessary conditions in all aspects to encourage scientists' creative labor. What the Communist Party cares about is the development of science, and what it supports is the correct theory. Michurin's theories have developed under the support of the Soviet Communist Party. And for academic issues, the Communist Party has always advocated freedom of criticism and freedom of discussion. The discussion of species in the Soviet scientific community is the best proof of this. The discussion of species has played a huge positive role in the development of biological science. This discussion was carried out under the leadership and encouragement of the Soviet Communist Party. Ignoring this almost well-known fact, promoting that "the Communist Party supports wrong theories", and promoting that "scientists will be led astray if they respect the leadership of the Communist Party" is completely contrary to the realistic attitude that scientists should have.

    Of course, only a very few people in the scientific team hold the above erroneous ideas. But the erroneous nature of this idea is extremely serious. If this idea is allowed to spread, it will seriously hinder our study and research of Michurin's theories, and cause damage to our scientific and revolutionary undertakings. Therefore, we must still draw everyone's attention to criticize it here.

    There are also some shortcomings in studying and researching Michurin's theories. First of all, there is still a lack of a comprehensive and correct understanding of the great significance of Michurin's theories. The main manifestation is that Michurin's theories are not recognized as the basis of biological science, but are regarded as a school of biology. Our current research and study of Michurin's theories can be said to be basically limited to agronomy and botany, and has not been better applied to other departments of biological science. Secondly, we are not good at creatively combining the actual situation in China to study and research. There are often phenomena of mechanically copying in our work, and we are not good at flexibly applying the fundamental principles of Michurin's theories. Finally, our work in criticizing the bourgeois idealistic ideas in biological science is also very insufficient. Until now, the ideas of Mendel and Morgan still have a considerable influence among our biologists. We must carry out in-depth criticism of these erroneous ideas. At the same time, we must start discussions on important issues in Michurin's biology, such as the issue of species.

    Chairman Mao's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" and the "Resolution on the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" of the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, two documents of great historical significance, have pointed out a clear direction for our biological workers and agricultural scientific workers. Our biological workers and agricultural scientific workers must conscientiously and deeply study Chairman Mao's report and the resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and in accordance with the spirit of these two documents, more actively and correctly study and apply Michurin's theories, so that biology and agricultural science can become an active force in our country's socialist transformation and socialist construction, and better strive to complete the arduous and complex scientific research tasks.

    创造性地研究和运用米丘林学说为我国社会主义建设服务
    中国科学院生物学地学部副主任  童第周
    今年十月二十七日是伊凡·弗拉吉米罗维奇·米丘林的一百周年诞辰。今天我们怀着崇敬的心情举行学术性的纪念会，有着重大的意义。
    米丘林是苏联卓越的生物学家、伟大的自然改造者。他以自己光辉的工作，创造性地发展了达尔文主义，使唯物主义生物学走上了新的更高的阶段。
    在生物学整个历史发展过程中，一直进行着唯物主义反对唯心主义的思想斗争。近数十年来在生物科学中形成了这样的两个方向：一个是唯物主义的米丘林方向，一个是唯心主义的魏斯曼摩尔根方向。在一九四八年全苏列宁农业科学院八月会议上，以李森科为首的许多米丘林主义者依据无可争辩的事实彻底揭露了魏斯曼摩尔根主义理论上的错误和实践上的无效，捍卫和发展了米丘林学说，更加有力地证明了米丘林学说对于发展生物科学和发展农业生产具有极其重大的意义。
    米丘林学说是在辩证唯物主义的理论基础上发展起来的。米丘林学说的基本思想是有机体和它的生活条件的统一。它依据无数的实验证明了获得性可以遗传的科学真理，阐明了植物发育的阶段性和生活力及受精作用的本质，进而提出人类可以定向地改变有机体的本性，培育出合乎人类要求的动植物的新品种。米丘林学说改变了生物科学的面貌。米丘林学说不仅是农业科学的理论基础，并且也是一切其他生物科学的理论基础。
    米丘林学说的伟大力量，在于密切联系生活，联系生产实践。依据米丘林学说，人类就可以更加积极地有意识地控制生物的发育和发展。米丘林学说在苏维埃制度下成为全体苏联人民的财富，成为苏联发展社会主义农业生产不可缺少的有力武器。同时，社会主义农业也为米丘林学说的发展创立了优越的条件，发展着米丘林学说。现在，不仅苏联的生物学家，包括广大的国营农场工作者和集体农庄的庄员在米丘林学说的指导下进行工作，而且这个学说已为全世界先进的生物学家所接受。
    中华人民共和国的成立，为米丘林学说在我国的广泛传播创造了有利的条件。六年来在全国范围内形成了研究和学习米丘林学说的热潮。不少苏联生物学家先后来我国考察和讲学。有关的著作大量翻译出版。在北京和许多省区举办了米丘林学说讲习班和传授班。许多生物学家、农学家和青年学生以极大的热情进行了对米丘林学说系统的研究和学习。米丘林的名字并且已经传到广大农村，不少农民组织了米丘林技术小组。这对改进我国农业技术、发展农业生产，起着积极的作用。
    六年来，许多生物科学工作者通过自己的研究和学习，逐步认识到魏斯曼摩尔根主义的毒害和米丘林学说的正确性。在改变生活条件使有机体定向变异方面我们进行了一些工作。例如：根据阶段发育理论，已成功地将几个春小麦品种改变为冬小麦，能在零下三十度的严寒条件下越冬，为进一步创造各种作物的越冬耐寒类型开辟了途径。利用高温教养的方法，不断提高了酵母菌对于高温的适应性，初步培育成能在四十度高温下正常发育的高温类型的酵母，可以增加酒精的生产。兔化牛瘟病毒通过了绵羊的接种，改变了病毒的遗传性，从而改良了疫苗的性质，制成了适用于西北、西南地区牦牛的牛瘟病毒疫苗，制止了许多牧区牛瘟的流行。这些实例使我们信服米丘林的话：“由于人的干预，使每种形态的动植物更快地改变，并且向人类所希望的方向改变成为可能”，同时使我们认识到魏斯曼摩尔根主义所谓遗传物质的“永存性”、“不变性”的虚伪性。
    植物阶段发育理论是李森科对米丘林学说的一个重要发展。这一理论指出，有机体的特征和特性是在阶段发育的基础上形成的。它粉碎了植物生理学中唯心的“光周期”、“成花激素”的错误假说。在植物阶段发育理论启发之下，我们进行了植物特征和特性形成的研究。几年来我们还进行了一系列植物阶段发育分析的研究。对于稻、麦、棉、大豆、大蒜等作物的阶段发育特性以及同自然条件的关系有了初步的认识，为选种及栽培工作提供了科学依据。例如，一般陆地棉品种经过春化处理后，可以提早成熟和提高霜前花产量，指出了在生产上推行春化处理的重要性。一九五三年和一九五四年春季小麦拔节以后，全国许多地区发生冻害，由于对小麦品种的发育特性有所了解，提出灌水施肥的补救办法，没有去耕翻受害的小麦改播秋季作物，减少了不小损失。
    几年来无性嫁接的工作，也雄辩地证明了“染色体的遗传理论”是错误的，使我们认识到有机体的任何一个生活部分都具有遗传性。在茄科植物的嫁接工作中，已初步探索了它的一些特征和特性的遗传现象。在海岛棉陆地棉无性嫁接研究中，在陆地棉的教养下，进行定向培育，使海岛棉能提早两个月开花，这样使海岛棉能在我国棉区栽培，而为长绒棉品种的选育提供了条件。树木及家禽的无性杂交研究也已初步展开，为树木及家禽的选种开辟了新的途径。
    运用米丘林学说中有性杂交及选择受精作用的理论，我们开始了一些有性杂交选种及提高种子生活力的研究工作，以实际研究成果击毁了“纯系学说”等唯心主义理论。本来被认为已经没有选育希望的中棉与陆地棉的杂交后代，现在成为宝贵的选种材料，再经过多年的培育有可能成为新棉种。采取新疆“哈萨克”羊同苏联“高加索”羊的复式杂交的方法，育成了毛肉兼用的新疆羊。这种羊同我国“蒙古”、“西藏”及“哈萨克”羊相比，体重超过百分之四十五以上，产毛量超过六倍以上，可作为六十支细毛的纺织原料。关于提高几种主要农作物种子生活力的研究的结果，表明我们有可能得出解决品种退化现象、提高其品质和产量的有效方法。家蚕混精杂交的研究工作，驳斥了魏斯曼摩尔根主义关于受精作用的虚伪理论。
    在总结广大农民的生产知识中，我们也运用了米丘林学说，发现了许多宝贵的先进经验。这些经验的推广，对增加农业生产起了重大的作用。全国棉花丰产劳动模范曲耀离选大铃留种的成就，在“纯系学说”的“理论”下可以说是梦想不到的奇迹。
    在米丘林学说的影响下，几年来我们有效地改进了生产技术。我们已在全国范围内开始有系统地整理农家品种并从中选出了不少优良品种和群体，推广了稻麦棉等作物的合理密植、玉米的人工辅助授粉以及家畜的经济杂交等方法。新疆玛纳斯河流域大面积棉田年年增产，是创造性地运用米丘林学说对发展农业生产具有重大意义的一个实例。几年来我们还根据米丘林驯化理论，正进行着规模巨大的热带资源植物向北扩展的工作，和开始进行国外家畜品种的驯化工作。
    从上面列举的一些事实中可以看到，我们在过去六年中，学习和研究米丘林学说是获得了一定的成绩的。在各个地区、各个工作岗位上的生物学家、农学家，包括研究所的研究人员、学校教师以及生产岗位上实际工作者，在这方面进行了大量的劳动。这些成绩的获得，为生物科学在我国发展奠定了初步的基础。
    我们取得这些初步成绩，正如米丘林学说在苏联得到蓬勃发展一样，是和共产党和政府的领导与支持分不开的。共产党和政府对科学工作的一系列的政策，是科学工作能够发展并有效地为国家建设服务的保证。
    我国目前正在进行伟大的社会主义建设，不但工业正在蓬勃地向前发展，而且全国范围内的农业合作化的高潮也将到来。全国生物学家、农学家应该积极学习米丘林学说，并在米丘林学说的指导下，在科学工作方面作出更多更好的成绩，使我国农业生产能够适应着工业化的需要而迅速提高。六年来，我国极大多数的生物学家、农学家在学习米丘林学说方面是热情的和积极的。上述成绩的取得，就充分地说明了这一点。我们相信在农业合作化的高潮中，大家一定会更加热情地更加积极地来学习米丘林学说，在科学工作方面作出更多的成绩。但是在生物学界中也还有一些人坚持孟德尔摩尔根主义，对米丘林学说采取盲目反对的态度。个别的人，在他的研究工作中完全忽视米丘林学说，在他的生物学的著作中一字不提米丘林，又不以科学家的态度来进行学术论争，却别有用心地利用苏联科学家们对物种问题的学术争论，利用苏联一些生物学家在物种问题上对李森科持有不同的学术见解，来贬低米丘林学说的意义，歪曲苏联共产党对科学事业的正确的政策，说什么李森科关于物种的新见解在初发表的时候，由于政治力量的支持而风行一时，但不久就引起了学术界批评，大部分否定了李森科的论点云云。十分明显，这种论调是完全不合事实的。我国的生物学工作者必须对此有十分深刻的认识，才不致被引入迷途，大家知道，苏联共产党（中国共产党也一样）对于科学事业的发展，向来给以极大的关怀。共产党不断给予科学家以马克思列宁主义的思想武装，并且在一切方面创设必要的条件来鼓励科学家的创造性劳动。共产党所关心的是科学的发展，所支持的是正确的理论，米丘林学说就是在苏联共产党的支持下发展起来的。而对于学术问题，共产党是一向主张自由批评和自由讨论的。苏联科学界关于物种问题的讨论，就是一个最好的证明。物种的讨论已经对生物科学的发展，起了巨大的积极的作用，这个讨论就正是在苏联共产党的领导和鼓舞之下进行的。不顾这个几乎众所周知的事实，宣传什么共产党支持错误的理论，宣传什么科学家如果尊重共产党的领导就要被引入迷途”，是完全违反科学家应有的实事求是的态度的。
    当然，抱有上述错误思想的，只是科学队伍中极其个别的人。但是这种思想的错误性质是极其严重的。这种思想如果任其传播就会严重地阻碍我们学习和研究米丘林学说，使我们的科学事业和革命事业遭受损害。因此，我们在这里仍要提请大家注意加以批判。
    在学习和研究米丘林学说中也还存在一些缺点。首先是对米丘林学说的重大意义还缺少全面的正确的认识。主要表现为没有认识到米丘林学说是生物科学的基础，而把它看作生物学中的一个学派。我们目前对于米丘林学说的研究和学习可以说基本上还是局限于农学方面和植物学方面，还没有把它更好地运用到生物科学的其他部门中。其次是我们不善于创造性地结合中国的实际情况来学习和研究，在我们的工作中还常常有生搬硬套的现象，不善于灵活地运用米丘林学说的根本原理。最后，我们在批判生物科学中的资产阶级唯心主义思想方面的工作也做得非常不够。直到现在为止，孟德尔、摩尔根主义的思想在我们生物学家中还有不小的影响。我们一定要对这些错误思想进行深入的批判。同时必须展开米丘林生物学中重要问题如物种问题的讨论。
    毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的报告，和中国共产党第七届中央委员会第六次全体会议（扩大）“关于农业合作化问题的决议”这两个具有伟大的历史意义的文件的发表，给我们生物学工作者和农业科学工作者指出了明确的方向。我们生物学工作者和农业科学工作者必须认真深入学习毛主席的报告和中国共产党中央委员会的决议，按照这两个文件的精神，更积极地和正确地来研究和运用米丘林学说，使生物学和农业科学成为我国社会主义改造和社会主义建设事业中的一支积极的力量，更好地为完成繁重而复杂的科学研究任务而奋斗。
