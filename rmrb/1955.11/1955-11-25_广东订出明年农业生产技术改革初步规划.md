Guangdong Province, in order to meet the needs of the cooperative movement and to fulfill the state production plan, has recently formulated a preliminary plan for agricultural production technology reform in 1956. According to this plan, Guangdong Province will implement six technical reforms in grain production next year: intercropping of rice changed to continuous cropping (including in sandy fields), single cropping changed to double cropping, broadcast sowing changed to row sowing or transplanting, mixed planting changed to two crops, intercropping of legumes in coarse grain fields, and increasing one crop in late rice seedling fields. At the same time, it is required that the area of densely planted rice account for 63% of the province's rice fields; the area using improved varieties should be expanded to 28 million mu; and 150,000 "5-1" paddy field plows and double-wheel double-share plows should be promoted. Through these measures, it is estimated that grain production can be increased by 700 million jin in 1956. In terms of cash crops: the preliminary plan for next year, in addition to actively expanding the planting area, mainly focuses on promoting the use of improved varieties and improving cultivation techniques.

In recent years, Guangdong Province has achieved certain results in promoting agricultural technology reform on the basis of mutual assistance and cooperation. In 1955, in the sandy field areas of the Pearl River Delta, more than 730,000 mu of rice fields were changed from intercropping to continuous cropping, an increase of three times compared with 1954. After the change to continuous cropping, yields generally increased by 60% to 100% compared to the original. The area of dense planting in the province this year has also expanded by 25 million mu compared to last year; fields using dense planting can generally increase production by 10% to 30%. There have also been great improvements in the cultivation and processing techniques of cash crops. Local farmers have personally experienced that advanced agricultural farming techniques must be adopted to increase grain production. (Our correspondent in Guangzhou)

　　广东订出明年农业生产技术改革初步规划
　　广东省为了适应合作化运动发展的需要和完成国家生产计划，最近已订出了一九五六年农业生产技术改革的初步规划。根据这个规划，广东省明年在粮食生产方面将实施水稻间作改连作（包括沙田）、单造改双造、撒播改条播或插秧、混种改两造、杂粮地间作豆类、晚造秧地改增种一造等六项技术改革。同时要求明年推行密植的水稻占全省稻田面积百分之六十三；采用良种面积要求扩大到二千八百万亩；推广“五一”水田犁和双轮双铧犁十五万部。通过这些措施，估计一九五六年可以增产粮食七亿斤。在技术作物方面：初步规划明年除了积极扩大种植面积外，主要是推广采用优良品种和改进栽培技术。
　　几年来广东省在互助合作的基础上推行农业技术改革工作已取得一定的成绩。一九五五年在珠江三角洲上的沙田地区，水稻间作改为连作的已有七十三万多亩，比一九五四年增加了三倍；改为连作后，一般都比原来增产六成至一倍左右。全省今年实行密植的面积也比去年扩大了二千五百万亩；采用密植的田，一般能增产一成至三成。在技术作物的栽培和加工技术方面，也有了很大的改进。当地农民已亲身体验到必须采用先进的农业耕作技术才能增产粮食。　（本报驻广州记者）
