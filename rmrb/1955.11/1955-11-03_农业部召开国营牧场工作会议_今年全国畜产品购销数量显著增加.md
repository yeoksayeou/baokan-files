Ministry of Agriculture Holds National State-Owned Ranch Work Conference
National Purchases and Sales of Livestock Products Increase Significantly This Year
(By Our Newspaper) The Ministry of Agriculture convened the first National State-Owned Ranch Work Conference from October 20th to 31st. The conference summarized and exchanged work experiences and determined the direction and tasks for the future development of state-owned ranches.

There are now 169 state-owned ranches nationwide, raising a total of more than 58,000 horses and cattle, more than 240,000 sheep, and more than 18,000 pigs, with 34 million mu of land. In recent years, these state-owned ranches have played a certain role in cultivating and promoting fine breeds of livestock and demonstrating to the masses, and have trained working cadres and accumulated some experience in running ranches.

The conference criticized the ranches' shortcomings, such as oversized organizational structures, excessive non-production personnel, poor management, and weak political and ideological leadership, and particularly criticized the error of not calculating costs in management. The conference unanimously agreed that all ranches must conduct comprehensive planning in the future, resolutely implement the management policy of socialist enterprises, implement economic accounting, implement diversified operations combining agriculture and animal husbandry, and produce a large number of livestock products and accumulate funds for the country. The conference stipulated that stud farms should focus on the large-scale breeding and cultivation of fine breeds of livestock in the future, and also produce a large number of livestock products and turn over profits to the state; economic ranches should mainly increase the production of livestock products in large quantities in the future, and strive to breed fine breeds of livestock. At present, the general lack of attention to feed production and reliance on state supply of feed in various ranches not only makes the cost of raising livestock high, but also greatly affects the development of livestock. Therefore, the conference required all ranches to actively establish feed bases and quickly achieve self-sufficiency in feed. In larger ranches in agricultural areas or agro-pastoral areas, all feed, grain, and vegetables must be completely self-sufficient from 1956, and efforts should be made to turn over a portion of the grain to the state. Newly built ranches in the future must plant feed and grain crops at the same time as the ranches are built. The conference also required all farms to improve the feeding and management of livestock, do a good job in livestock breeding, pregnancy protection, and calving, and strengthen livestock epidemic prevention and hygiene work. The conference also required all farms to streamline their organizations, tighten staffing, improve labor efficiency, strengthen political and ideological education for employees, and give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of employees. At the same time, all farms should help the surrounding masses do a good job in preventing animal diseases and impart simple and easy-to-use scientific techniques to the masses. The conference also required all ranches to conduct a rectification campaign this winter and next spring and launch an increase production and practice economy movement.

The conference stipulated that newly built ranches in the future should focus on pastoral areas, mountainous areas, urban industrial and mining areas, and areas producing fine livestock. Southern China is evergreen all year round and has good water and grass, so attention should be paid to the development of animal husbandry.

According to the spirit of the conference, the participants examined the shortcomings of their respective units and planned to breed more than 20,000 horses and cattle, more than 100,000 sheep, and more than 34,000 pigs in 1956, producing more than 498,000 kilograms of wool, more than 2,000 kilograms of milk, and more than 660,000 kilograms of meat; expand cultivated land by about 1 million mu next year, producing 80 million to 100 million jin of grain. In this way, not only will feed and grain be self-sufficient, but a portion of the grain can also be turned over to the state. Among them, 65 ranches plan to turn over a profit of 4 million yuan next year.

(By Our Newspaper) The purchase and sales volume of livestock products nationwide has increased significantly this year. According to statistics from the China Livestock Products Company, by the end of September this year, the total value of livestock products purchased nationwide had exceeded the same period in 1954 by 45.36%. Among them, the main livestock products, such as sheep wool, increased by 14%, goat wool increased by 41%, camel hair increased by 22%, cashmere increased by 5%, pig bristles increased by 1.8%, and pig casings increased by 35%. The purchase volume of various hides and skins increased by 95%. Due to the promotion of pigskin leather making in various places this year, the purchase volume of pigskin increased more than seven times compared with 1954. From January to September this year, the income obtained by farmers and herdsmen nationwide from selling livestock products increased a lot compared with the same period in 1954, with the increased income being equivalent to the price of about 970 million jin of grain.

From January to September this year, the total value of livestock products supplied by the China Livestock Products Company to the domestic market also increased by 55.94% compared with the same period in 1954. The China Livestock Products Company also organizes the export of livestock products in large quantities in order to exchange for materials needed for national construction.

    农业部召开国营牧场工作会议
    今年全国畜产品购销数量显著增加
    本报讯　农业部在十月二十日到三十一日召开了第一次全国国营牧场工作会议。这次会议总结和交流了工作经验，确定了今后国营牧场发展的方针和任务。
    全国国营牧场现在已有一百六十九处，共饲养马、牛五万八千多头、羊二十四万多只、猪一万八千多头，拥有土地三千四百万亩。几年来，这些国营牧场在培育和推广优良种畜及向群众示范等方面都起了一定作用，并培养了工作干部和积累了一些办场经验。
    会议对牧场的组织机构庞大、非生产人员多、经营管理不善和政治思想领导薄弱等缺点，作了批判，特别批判了经营管理上不计算成本的错误。会议一致认为，今后各牧场都必须进行全面规划，坚决贯彻执行社会主义企业的经营管理方针，实行经济核算，实行农牧业结合的多种经营，为国家生产大量的畜产品和积累资金。会议规定：种畜场今后以大量繁殖和培养优良种畜为主，同时也要生产大量畜产品，向国家上缴利润；经济牧场今后主要是大量增产畜产品，并尽力繁殖优良种畜。目前，各牧场普遍不重视饲料生产而依靠国家供给饲料的情况，不仅使饲养的牲畜成本高，而且使牲畜的发展也受到很大影响。因此会议要求各牧场积极建立饲料基地，迅速做到饲料自给。在农业区或农牧交错的较大牧场，从一九五六年起，饲料、粮食、蔬菜必须全部自给自足，并争取向国家上缴一部分粮食。今后新建的牧场必须在建场的同时就种植饲料和粮食作物。会议还要求各场改善牲畜的饲养管理，作好牲畜配种、保胎和产仔工作，加强牲畜防疫卫生工作。会议还要求各场精简机构，紧缩编制，提高劳动效率，加强对职工的政治思想教育工作，充分发挥职工的积极性和创造性。同时各场要帮助周围群众作好兽疫防治工作，向群众传授简单易行的科学技术。会议还要求各牧场在今冬明春进行一次整顿，开展增产节约运动。
    会议规定今后新建牧场重点应放在牧区、山区、城市工矿区和优良牲畜产区。我国南方四季常绿，水草良好，应注意发展牧业。
    到会人员根据会议的精神，检查了本单位的缺点，并计划一九五六年繁殖各种马、牛二万多头，各种羊十万多只，猪三万四千多头，计产羊毛四十九万八千多公斤，牛奶二千多公斤，肉类六十六万多公斤；明年扩大耕地一百万亩左右，计产粮食八千万斤到一亿斤。这样，不仅饲料、粮食达到自给，还可上缴一部分粮食。其中有六十五个牧场计划明年上缴利润四百万元。
    本报讯　今年全国畜产品的购、销数量有了显著的增长。据中国畜产公司统计：到今年九月底，全国收购畜产品的总值，已超过一九五四年同期的百分之四十五点三六。其中主要畜产品，如绵羊毛增加了百分之十四，山羊毛增加了百分之四十一，驼毛增加了百分之二十二，羊绒增加了百分之五，猪鬃增加了百分之一点八，猪肠衣增加了百分之三十五。各种皮张的收购量增加了百分之九十五。由于今年各地推广猪皮制革的结果，猪皮的收购量比一九五四年增加七倍以上。今年一至九月份全国农牧民出卖畜产品所得的收入比一九五四年同期增加很多，增加的收入约相当于九亿七千多万斤粮食的价格。
    中国畜产公司今年一至九月份供应国内市场的畜产品总值也较一九五四年同期增加了百分之五十五点九四。中国畜产公司还组织畜产品大量出口，以换回国家建设所需的物资。
