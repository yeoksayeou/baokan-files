Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 19th: The Tokyo Overseas Chinese Association lodged a serious protest with the Japanese government authorities on November 18th, protesting the Japanese government's illegal arrest of Hong Jinshan, a Chinese national who was scheduled to return home on the Japanese ship "Xing'an Maru" from Maizuru Port, and demanded that the Japanese government immediately release Hong Jinshan so that he could return home smoothly.

Hong Jinshan was arrested at Nagoya Station on the morning of the 18th while en route from Tokyo to Maizuru.

According to the person in charge of the Tokyo Overseas Chinese Association, Hong Jinshan was formerly a student sent by Taiwan to study at the Japanese Police University. After graduation, he was unwilling to return to Taiwan, but the Japanese government refused to allow him to continue residing in Japan. Therefore, he went through the Tokyo Overseas Chinese Association to formally complete the procedures for returning to mainland China with the Japanese government and three groups including the Japanese Red Cross Society. Hong Jinshan did not commit any illegal acts in Japan. The person in charge of the Tokyo Overseas Chinese Association believes that the Japanese government authorities' arrest and detention of Hong Jinshan is completely unjustified.

The three groups responsible for assisting Chinese nationals in returning home on the "Xing'an Maru," including the Japanese Red Cross Society, the Japan-China Friendship Association, and the Japan Peace Liaison Council, also protested to the Japanese government on the 18th and demanded that the Japanese government immediately release Hong Jinshan so that he can smoothly board the "Xing'an Maru" to return home.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 20th: One hundred and sixty-one Chinese nationals scheduled to return home from Maizuru on the Japanese ship "Xing'an Maru" on the 20th held a general meeting in Maizuru on the 19th, and unanimously passed a resolution protesting the Japanese government authorities' arrest and detention of five overseas Chinese, Hong Jinshan, Pan Guangkun, Guo Quanzhao, Gu Minsheng, and Cai Jinxiu, and decided that all returning overseas Chinese would not board the ship until the Japanese government released Hong Jinshan and the other four, allowing them to return home together on the "Xing'an Maru."

Hong Jinshan was arrested at Nagoya Station on the morning of the 18th while en route from Tokyo to Maizuru. Pan Guangkun, Guo Quanzhao, Gu Minsheng, and Cai Jinxiu were detained on November 4th at the Hamamatsu "Reception Center" for resisting the Japanese government authorities' forced transfer of overseas Chinese detained in this "Reception Center" to Taiwan. They had all formally completed the procedures for returning home through the Tokyo Overseas Chinese Association to the Japanese government and the three groups including the Japanese Red Cross Society.

The Tokyo Overseas Chinese Association issued a statement on the 20th, expressing its full support for the resolution passed by the general meeting of returning overseas Chinese held in Maizuru on the 19th. The statement said that the Japanese government has no right to interfere with Chinese nationals leaving Japan. The statement concluded by saying: The Japanese government should bear all responsibility for the situation caused by this illegal detention.

    新华社十九日讯　东京消息：东京华侨总会十一月十八日向日本政府当局提出严重抗议，抗议日本政府非法逮捕将由舞鹤港搭乘日本轮船“兴安丸”回国的中国侨民洪进山，并且要求日本政府立即释放洪进山，使他得以顺利回国。
    洪进山是在十八日清晨从东京赴舞鹤途中在名古屋车站上被捕的。
    据东京华侨总会负责人说，洪进山过去是台湾派到日本警察大学留学的学生。他在毕业后，不愿回到台湾，但是日本政府拒绝他继续居留日本，因此，他通过东京华侨总会向日本政府和日本红十字会等三团体正式办妥了回国手续，准备回到中国大陆。洪进山在日本并没有任何违法行为。东京华侨总会负责人认为，日本政府当局逮捕和拘留洪进山是毫无理由的。
    负责协助中国侨民搭乘“兴安丸”回国的日本红十字会、日中友好协会和日本和平联络会等三团体，也在十八日向日本政府提出抗议，并且要求日本政府立即释放洪进山，使他能够顺利搭乘“兴安丸”回国。
    新华社二十日讯　东京消息：预定在二十日从舞鹤搭乘日本轮船“兴安丸”回国的一百六十一个中国侨民，十九日在舞鹤举行全体大会，一致通过决议，抗议日本政府当局逮捕和拘留洪进山、潘广坤、郭全灶、顾敏生、蔡晋修等五名华侨，并且决定在日本政府释放洪进山等五人使他们能够搭乘
  “兴安丸”一同回国以前，全体归侨决不上船。
    洪进山是在十八日清晨从东京赴舞鹤途中在名古屋车站上被捕的。潘广坤、郭全灶、顾敏生、蔡晋修是在十一月四日在滨松“收容所”因反抗日本政府当局把被拘留在这个“收容所”的华侨强制送往台湾而被拘留的。他们都曾经过东京华侨总会向日本政府和日本红十字会等三团体正式办妥了回国的手续。
    东京华侨总会在二十日发表声明，表示完全支持十九日在舞鹤举行的归国华侨全体大会所通过的决议。声明说，中国侨民从日本出境，日本政府没有干涉他们的任何权利。声明最后说：对于这种非法拘留所引起的情事，日本政府应当负一切责任。
