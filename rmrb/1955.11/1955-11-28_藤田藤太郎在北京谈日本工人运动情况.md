　　Fujita Totaro Talks About the Situation of the Japanese Workers' Movement in Beijing

According to Xinhua News Agency, Fujita Totaro, head of the Japanese trade union delegation, gave a speech to cadres of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions on the 25th about the Japanese workers' movement. The following is a summary: From 1900, our predecessors launched workers' struggle movements in factories and mines, but at that time, it was mainly intellectuals who initiated the movement. Organizationally, the Workers' Friendly Association was established at that time. Later, leaders gradually emerged from among the workers in factories and mines. At that time, the Labor General Alliance, the National Trade Union Council, and the National Trade Union Association carried out activities.

In 1928, the number of organized workers reached one million. At that time, the core of the trade union organization was the Seamen's Union, the Metalworkers' Union, and the Transport Workers' Union.

After the deflation policy implemented in 1930, the bourgeoisie began to divide the trade unions, and continuous persecution and activities to turn the trade unions into government-controlled organizations destroyed the trade union organizations. Finally, in 1938, the government issued an order to dissolve the trade unions, and thus legal trade unions no longer existed. The war launched in 1937, which caused disaster to your country, deprived workers of their freedom and rights.

The Japanese labor movement began after the end of the war on August 15, 1945. From that time on, trade unions were established in various places.

The organizational policy of Japanese trade unions is to strive to establish national unified organizations for various industries, and this has now begun. Workers in transportation, national affairs, coal mines, electricity, metal industries, etc., have begun activities to establish national organizations. Workers have also carried out activities on how to establish joint organizations of various industrial trade unions. As a result, two national joint organizations were established: 1. All-Japan Federation of Industrial Trade Unions; 2. Japan General Federation of Trade Unions. However, many national industrial trade unions have not yet joined these two organizations. In 1946, six million workers were organized.

In 1947, the All-Japan Trade Union Liaison Council (abbreviated as Zenroren) was proclaimed to be established with the participation of all trade unions. This was the first step in the unification of Japanese workers. Among them, due to the increasingly sharp opposition between the All-Japan Federation of Industrial Trade Unions and the Japan General Federation of Trade Unions, the neutral trade unions participating in Zenroren withdrew from Zenroren. At that time, another movement was launched, that is, for the national unified organization of trade unions, without the participation of fixed joint organizations, but by individual industrial trade unions, combined into a strong national industrial unified trade union organization. This is how today's General Council of Trade Unions of Japan was established.

Today's situation of Japanese trade union organizations:

1. General Council of Trade Unions of Japan: There are 39 national industrial trade unions, with 3 million trade union members;
2. Sixteen neutral trade unions cooperating with the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, with 500,000 members;
3. The All-Japan Federation of Trade Unions has four trade unions, with 700,000 members;
4. The National Federation of Industrial Trade Unions has 35,000 members;
5. The All-Japan Federation of Industrial Trade Unions has 12,000 members;
6. There are also local trade union councils in various prefectures and counties that cooperate with the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan. These are trade union organizations established in various places with the members of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan as the core;
7. Trade unions that do not participate in any organization.

More than 4 million workers are fighting according to the policy of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan.

Now I would like to talk about the political and economic situation in the past ten years since the war.

In the early days, due to inflation, repeated struggles were carried out to demand wage increases. By 1949, inflation began to slow down. However, with the Korean War as the beginning in 1950, inflation intensified again.

After the war, the political policy of the Conservative Party was to revive the financial groups by attempting to implement economic cooperation with the United States. In the latter period, the Conservative Party blatantly put forward the policy of revising the constitution and implementing rearmament, and economically implemented the policies of capital monopoly, oppression of small and medium-sized enterprises, and lowering the living standards of workers. Japanese-US economic cooperation may be a relationship of subordination rather than cooperation in political terms.

Workers, farmers, citizens, and many people oppose strengthening the Self-Defense Forces and expanding US military bases in Japan. This is the action of the masses of the people, who demand peace and do not want another war.

The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan believes that today's political actions of the Conservative Party run counter to the will of the Japanese people to defend peace, and that Japan's main cooperation with the United States endangers Japan's independent economy. Therefore, it is adopting the following policies to carry out struggles:

Internationally, Japan maintains a neutral position, restores diplomatic relations with countries around the world, led by China, and engages in free trade to defend Japan's peace and independent economy;

We resolutely defend the constitution based on advocating peace, oppose rearmament and military bases, strive for national independence and the freedom and democracy of the people, and safeguard our lives;

In order to join hands with the broad masses of people from all walks of life to fight against reactionary forces, we are awakening every worker in factories and mines, uniting and organizing workers in every region, strengthening ties with farmers and citizens, and launching activities;

The Japanese nation, which has suffered from the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the disaster of the hydrogen bomb test on Bikini Atoll, is actively launching a movement to protect the world's people from the disasters of atomic and hydrogen bombs and to oppose atomic and hydrogen bombs, and has sent appeals to the people of various countries through various opportunities; the World Conference against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs was held in Hiroshima for three days on August 6, 7, and 8 this year. We invited representatives from many countries, especially the delegation from your country led by Mr. Liu Ningyi, to participate in the conference, and we are very grateful.

The Japanese working class is no less enthusiastic about defending peace than others. Today, forming a unified front of workers in Japan is an important task. The Japanese working class must do everything possible to complete this task, and at the same time, it must strive to organize workers who have not yet been organized in the spirit of working-class solidarity. This year, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan is preparing to rely on the assistance of trade union members to send organizational workers to 46 regions to organize small and medium-sized enterprise workers and protect their interests. In addition, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan has also formulated a struggle policy to unite workers in various industries to carry out unified struggles; we firmly believe that the awakening of workers in various industries and their united struggle will make the workers' movement develop more than in the past.

Workers of all countries unite, we working people must build a happy world. This is the common task of the working class. We believe that we must first do a good job in the friendship and unity of Asian and African workers. The common task of workers is to strive for joint consultation, mutual assistance, and the search for the right direction, regardless of which organization the trade union belongs to. To this end, it is necessary to create opportunities to enhance friendship and understanding between workers in various countries. And the workers of China, Japan, India, and other Asian countries must assume important tasks. Because this is linked to defending peace in Asia and defending peace in the world.

This time I came to your country for a visit, and I have come into contact with the friendship of the workers in your country in various places, which I will never forget in my life.

Your country and our country have not yet restored diplomatic relations, but I have gained many friends, and we must use our strength to eliminate the obstacles to restoring diplomatic relations. Japanese workers look forward to restoring diplomatic relations with your country and are fighting for this purpose, and they hope to be friends with friends from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. After I return to my country, I will further strive to restore diplomatic relations with your country as soon as possible and work hard to further enhance the friendship between the workers of the two countries.

### 藤田藤太郎在北京谈日本工人运动情况

　　藤田藤太郎在北京谈日本工人运动情况
    据新华社讯　日本工会代表团团长藤田藤太郎二十五日向中华全国总工会干部作了关于日本工人运动的演讲，摘要如下：从一九○○年起，我们的前辈曾经展开了厂矿的工人斗争运动，但在当时，主要是知识分子展开的运动。从组织上说，那时成立了工人友爱会。后来，在厂矿的工人中间逐渐出现了领导者，当时由劳动总同盟、全国工会评议会、全国工会协议会进行了活动。
    在一九二八年，有组织的工人曾经达到一百万人。当时工会组织的核心是海员工会、五金工会和交通工会。
    一九三○年开始实行的通货紧缩政策过去以后，资产阶级开始分化工会，接连不断的迫害和要把工会变为御用工会的活动，破坏了工会组织。最后在一九三八年，政府下了一道解散工会的命令，因而合法的工会便不存在了。一九三七年发动的使贵国遭受灾难的战争，剥夺了工人的自由和权利。
    日本的劳工运动是从一九四五年八月十五日战争结束以后开始的。从那个时候起，各地成立了工会。
    日本工会的组织方针是争取建立各种产业的全国统一组织，现在已经开始建立。交通事业、国家事业、煤矿、电气产业、五金产业等的工人开始了建立全国性组织的活动。工人也进行了如何建立各种产业工会的联合组织的活动。于是建立了两个全国性的联合组织：一、全日本产业别工会会议；二、日本工会总同盟。但是，还有不少的全国性产业工会未能参加这两个组织。在一九四六年，组织起来的工人达六百万人。
    一九四七年，全日本工会联络协议会（简称全劳联）在一切工会参加之下宣告成立。这就是日本工人统一的第一步。其中，由于全日本产业别工会会议和日本工会总同盟的意见对立渐趋尖锐，参加全劳联的中立工会就脱离了全劳联。当时又展开了一个运动，这就是，为了工会的全国统一组织，不使固定的联合组织参加，而由各产业工会个别地参加，结合成强有力的全国产业别统一工会组织。这样就成立了今天的日本工会总评议会。
    今天日本的工会组织的情况：
    一、日本工会总评议会：全国性产业工会有三十九个，工会会员三百万人；
    二、和日本工会总评议会合作的中立工会十六个，会员五十万人；
    三、全日本工会会议有四个工会，会员七十万人；
    四、全国产业别工会联合会有会员三万五千人；
    五、全日本产业别工会会议有会员一万二千人；
    六、还有和日本工会总评议会合作的各个府县的地方工会评议会，这是以日本工会总评议会的委员为核心，在各地建立的工会组织；
    七、不参加任何组织的工会。
    按照日本工会总评议会的方针进行斗争的工人超过四百万人。
    现在我想谈一谈战后十年来的政治经济情况。
    初期，由于通货膨胀，反复进行了要求提高工资的斗争。到一九四九年通货膨胀变得缓慢起来。但以一九五○年朝鲜战争为开端，通货膨胀又行加剧。
    战后，保守党的政治是企图同美国实行经济合作来复活财阀。保守党在后一个时期露骨地提出了修改宪法和实行重整军备的政策，在经济上实行了大资本垄断、压迫中小企业和降低工人生活水平的政策。日美经济合作在政治上也许可以说是从属的关系，而不是合作关系的方向。
    工人、农民、市民，许多人都反对在日本加强自卫队和扩大美国军事基地。这是人民大众的行动，他们要求和平，不愿再发生战争。
    日本工会总评议会认为，今天保守党的政治行动是同保卫和平的日本人民的意志背道而驰的，日本主要同美国实行合作，是危及日本的自立经济的，因此，正采取下述方针进行着斗争：
    在国际上，日本保持中立立场，同以中国为首的世界各国恢复邦交并自由进行贸易，保卫日本的和平和自立经济；
    我们坚决保卫以主张和平为基础的宪法，反对重整军备和军事基地，争取民族独立和人民的自由和民主，维护我们的生活；
    为了跟广大的各阶层人民携起手来同反动势力进行斗争，我们正在唤醒工厂和矿山里的每一个工人，团结和组织每一个地区的工人，加强同农民和市民的联系，展开着活动；
    受过广岛和长崎的原子弹轰炸和比基尼岛氢弹试验的灾害的日本民族，正积极展开保卫世界人类免受原子弹和氢弹灾害、反对原子弹和氢弹的运动，并且曾经通过各种机会向世界各国人民发出了号召；今年八月六、七、八日三天在广岛举行了禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会。我们邀请了许多国家的代表，特别是贵国以刘宁一先生为首的代表参加了大会，我们非常感谢。
    日本工人阶级保卫和平的热情不下于他人。今天日本工人阶级在国内组成工人的统一战线是一个重要的任务。日本工人阶级必须尽一切努力来完成这个任务，同时必须本着工人阶级的团结精神努力把尚未组织起来的工人组织起来。今年日本工会总评议会准备依靠工会会员的协助，向四十六个地方派出组织工作者，组织中小企业工人并保卫他们的利益。此外，日本工会总评议会还拟订了一项团结各产业工人进行统一斗争的斗争方针；我们坚信各产业工人觉悟起来，团结成一条心进行斗争，将使工人运动比过去更加发展。
    世界各国工人团结起来，我们劳动人民要建设一个幸福的世界。这是工人阶级的共同任务。我们认为，我们首先必须搞好亚洲和非洲工人的友好和团结。工人的共同任务是，不管工会属于哪一个组织都必须为共同协商、互相帮助和找寻正确的方向而努力。为此，需要创造增进各国工人之间的友好和了解的机会。而亚洲的中国、日本和印度等国工人必须负起重要的任务。因为这是同保卫亚洲和平保卫世界和平有联系的。
    这次我来贵国访问，在各地接触到贵国工人的友谊，这种友谊是我终生不能忘怀的。
    贵国和我国尚未恢复邦交，但是我却获得了许多朋友，必须用我们的力量来消除恢复邦交的障碍。日本工人盼望同贵国恢复邦交，并且正为此目的而进行着斗争，他们希望同总工会的朋友们友好。我回国以后将更进一步为早日同贵国恢复邦交而奋斗，并为进一步增进两国工人的友好而努力。
