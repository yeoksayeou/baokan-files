　　The Direction of 500 Million Peasants
    —An Account of Three Poor Peasant Households in Nanwangzhuang, Anping County, Hebei Province, Persisting in Running a Cooperative
　　Li Kai Qing Chenyi
    Chairman Mao said in his report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation": "There was a very small cooperative in Hebei Province with only six households. Three old middle-peasant households were firmly unwilling to continue, and they were allowed to leave; three poor peasant households expressed that they would continue no matter what, and they were allowed to stay, and the organization of the cooperative was preserved. In fact, the direction indicated by these three poor peasant households is the direction of the 500 million peasants of the whole country. All individual farmers will eventually take the path resolutely chosen by these three poor peasant households."

    What Chairman Mao was referring to here was the agricultural production cooperative run by the poor peasants Wang Yukun (a Party member), Wang Xiaoqi, and Wang Xiaopang in Nanwangzhuang, Anping County.

    On November 21st, we visited this agricultural production cooperative with excitement. In this village, we were presented with a new atmosphere: In the early morning, groups of three or five male and female cooperative members braved the cold wind to sweep up fallen leaves, preparing for winter manure accumulation; in the evening, farmers returning from cultivating the fields from all directions formed long lines on a narrow street. They were asking each other about the day's production achievements. The village cadres told us:
  “Recently, more than two hundred individual farming households have signed up to join the agricultural production cooperative. To strive for a bumper harvest next year, the cooperative members have launched a campaign to bring cultivated land into the cooperative. By tomorrow (the 24th), 4,700 mu of uncultivated land will be plowed. But last year, the heavy snow sealed off more than 500 mu of uncultivated land in our village!”
      "Listening to Chairman Mao's words, following the path taken by Yukun and the others, joining the cooperative, and running the cooperative well" has become the central topic of conversation among the village's farmers. The farmers who joined the cooperative were all so happy, with smiles on their faces. The cadres of the village's cooperative establishment preparatory committee were either discussing the evaluation of agricultural implements with the cooperative members or flipping through account books to plan the land. Wang Migui, the secretary of the Party branch, told us: "If you had come in the spring, you would not have seen this situation. At that time, many wealthy farmers were clamoring to withdraw from the cooperative, and production was not energetic! Now that the small cooperatives have merged into large cooperatives, the farmers who withdrew have returned to the cooperative, and production has changed..."

    In a short year, earth-shaking changes have taken place in Nanwangzhuang.
    In the autumn of 1954, the upsurge of the agricultural cooperativization movement in Hebei Province arrived. Nanwangzhuang, Anping County, originally had only three small cooperatives. At that time, two intermediate cooperatives and six small cooperatives were quickly established. The number of households participating in the cooperative increased from 21 to 264. Wang Yukun (a Party member), Wang Xiaoqi, and Wang Xiaopang, the poor peasants who participated in the agricultural production cooperative, demonstrated soaring socialist enthusiasm. They took the lead in joining the cooperative and tried everything possible to run the cooperative well. However, some wealthy farmers who joined the cooperative came to the cooperative to seek benefits. They were outwardly active, but not sincerely running the cooperative. They had personal plans in mind. At that time, Wang Wenzhang (an upper-middle peasant), the secretary of the branch, did not act according to the Party's policies and only represented the interests of the wealthy farmers. In the intermediate cooperative he led, ten out of fourteen team cadres were upper-middle peasants. The poor peasants Wang Yukun, Wang Xiaoqi, and Wang Xiaopang joined this cooperative. As soon as the cooperative was established, the cooperative members decided, based on the fact that most cooperative members had livestock and fodder, that the cooperative members' livestock should be valued and turned over to the cooperative. The poor and lower-middle peasant cooperative members who had livestock took the lead in leading their livestock to the cooperative in one afternoon. Wang Wenzhang and other wealthy farmers did not lead their mules to the cooperative. What's more, the cooperative cadres also proposed that the poor and lower-middle peasants who brought livestock into the cooperative should hand over all their fodder to the cooperative and allocate it to teams with less grass (teams with less grass were teams that retained more mules), while the wealthy farmers who retained mules could retain 30% of the grass. Wang Yukun and other poor peasant cooperative members waged a resolute struggle against the actions of Wang Wenzhang and others, who represented the interests of the wealthy farmers and harmed the interests of the poor peasants. As soon as Wang Wenzhang proposed that mules should not be brought into the cooperative, Yukun went to Wang Wenzhang and said: "If the mules of wealthy households are not brought into the cooperative, and the livestock of poor peasants are used for cultivation, what kind of principle is this?" When Wang Wenzhang saw that the situation was not good, he secretly sold the mules. Regarding the issue of fodder for livestock, Wang Yukun questioned the cooperative cadres again: "Those who brought livestock should take more grass, while those who did not bring livestock should take less grass. You only think about the wealthy farmers, why don't you think about the poor peasants?" Wang Wenzhang cunningly said: "This is mutual assistance and love." Yukun asked him: "When it comes to the poor peasants giving grass, you talk about love, but when the poor peasants lack food, why don't you let the wealthy households talk about love?" Wang Wenzhang was speechless. The Party member cadres in the cooperative not only did not examine their own capitalist ideology, some even did not do their work (such as Wang Wenzhang), and some even attacked Wang Yukun. When Wang Yukun's child died and he was in a bad mood, they reported to the county Party committee that Wang Yukun was working passively and blocking the Party's policies (which referred to not implementing the opinions of a few Party member cadres who harmed the interests of the poor peasants). At a branch committee meeting attended by people sent by the county Party committee, Yukun exposed their mistake of losing their class stand. Their plan to attack Wang Yukun failed.

    By this spring, some wealthy farmers were not actively producing, and were spreading rumors everywhere: "The cooperative cannot continue to be run!" "Running the cooperative affects production!" "Divide the cooperative into smaller cooperatives! If it is divided into smaller cooperatives, it can be run!" But many poor and lower-middle peasants in this cooperative were determined to run the cooperative. The problem was that the Party branch needed to be transformed and the dominance of the poor peasants in the cooperative needed to be established. However, the cadres who came to the village to rectify the cooperative listened to the opinions of a few wealthy farmers and hastily decided to divide this intermediate cooperative into seven small cooperatives based on teams. Wang Yukun, Wang Xiaoqi, Wang Xiaopang, and the middle peasants Wang Zhenhuai, Wang Zhenfu, and Wang Luohe, a total of six households, were divided into one small cooperative.
    The cadres who led the rectification of the cooperative were confident that it could be run if it was divided into small cooperatives. Contrary to their wishes, the problem of withdrawing from the cooperative occurred one after another in the small cooperatives. Originally, some wealthy farmers were not sincerely running small cooperatives. Their intention was to "make the large cooperative smaller, and dissolve the small cooperative." Production team leader Wang Wenshuang (an upper-middle peasant) had guaranteed to the rectification cadres before the small cooperative was divided: as long as it is divided into a small cooperative, I guarantee that I can lead it well. Sure enough, after it was divided into a small cooperative, he used the excuse that he could not do it and asked the cooperative members to re-elect the cooperative cadres. Many cooperative members planned to elect Li Wu (a Party member) as the director of the cooperative, but he asked the cooperative members to elect Wang Dandan, who had backward ideas. Wang Dandan did not know how to lead, and Wang Wenshuang did not care about anything. Before long, this cooperative collapsed.

    When the upper-middle peasants clamored to withdraw from the cooperative, some Party members, Youth League members, and activists among the poor peasants continued to move forward along the road pointed out by the Party. Wang Yukun, Wang Xiaoqi, and Wang Xiaopang walked at the forefront of this team. At that time, the struggle between the two roads was also fiercely waged in Wang Yukun's cooperative. The cooperative planted 4.8 mu of wheat in the field of cooperative member Wang Zhenhuai (an upper-middle peasant), which grew very well. Every time Wang Zhenhuai walked to the edge of the field, he started to make small calculations: there are only a few mu of good wheat in these six households. It is really a loss to run the cooperative with the poor peasants. When he saw that some small cooperatives had collapsed, he discussed withdrawing from the cooperative with another cooperative member Wang Zhenfu (a middle peasant, his brother). When the middle peasant Wang Luohe saw that two households had withdrawn, he also proposed withdrawing from the cooperative. Wang Yukun often patiently explained the direction and policies to them, and persuaded them to stay in the cooperative, but they said: "We will not take this road now, let's wait and see."

    In May, Yukun, Xiaoqi, and Xiaopang held a meeting. Yukun firmly said to them: "The Party tells us: to make everyone rich and ourselves rich, we must insist on leading the peasants to run the cooperative. I listen to the Party, and I will definitely continue to run it. What about you?" Xiaoqi said: "I have also made up my mind long ago. For households like mine, there is no other way but to join the cooperative." Xiaopang also said: "I have suffered enough from individual farming. Let them withdraw! As long as you run it, I will firmly follow you." Their determination to run the cooperative generated tremendous power. They discussed that if the three households insisted on withdrawing from the cooperative, they would divide one of the two cows in the cooperative among themselves, and continue to run the cooperative with three people and one cow.

    Soon, the county and district cooperative rectification working group came to the village to rectify the cooperative. At the cooperative rectification meeting, the working group asked everyone what they planned to do. Wang Zhenhuai, Wang Zhenfu, and Wang Luohe all proposed withdrawing from the cooperative. Wang Yukun, Wang Xiaoqi, and Wang Xiaopang firmly replied: If they withdraw from the cooperative, we will definitely run it.

    Why were Wang Yukun, Wang Xiaoqi, and Wang Xiaopang so determined to run the cooperative? The following situation can tell us:

    Wang Yukun is a strong middle-aged man who suffered from the devastation of the old society. Before the land reform, he was one of the poorest peasants in the village. In order to make a living, he had to work as a long-term laborer for the landlord. It was only because of the land reform that he was allocated land and his life gradually improved. He was the most active in the land reform struggle and was honorably admitted to the Communist Party. After the land reform, because of individual production, although he had more than ten mu of land, he had no agricultural implements and only half a head of livestock. Production was not good, and the yield was very low. More than ten mu of land could only yield more than 1,000 jin of grain. Several people in the family still lived an unprosperous life. The Party's policy of developing agricultural cooperation pointed out the direction to him and gave him unlimited power. In last year's cooperation movement, he actively led the peasants to run the cooperative.

    Wang Xiaoqi is a member of the Youth League. He and his mother will never forget the hard days before the land reform. At that time, his father died, and his mother led him to live a life, often lacking food and clothing. After the land reform, life improved compared to before, but he had no agricultural implements. What about livestock? There was only one cow leg. He was young and did not understand farming techniques, and the land yield was also very low. The life of the family was always tight. When the Party pointed out that the road of agricultural cooperation was the only correct road for peasants to get rid of poverty, he discussed with his mother and took the lead in joining the cooperative.

    Wang Xiaopang: When he was young, he begged for food with his mother. After the land reform, because he lacked this and that, he still could not farm the land well. He had dreamed about how to make his life prosperous, but he could not do it on the basis of individual production. When farming, because there was no livestock or agricultural implements, he watched the land unable to be sown; even if he reluctantly planted it, he could not manage it well because he lacked this and that. He often approached Communist Party member Wang Yukun and others. When he understood that only by taking the road of cooperation could he get rid of poverty, the idea of running the cooperative well burned like a flame in his heart. In last year's cooperation movement, he and Yukun and Xiaoqi were together and became activists.

    When the three households of Wang Yukun's cooperative requested to withdraw from the cooperative and three households insisted on continuing to run it, the task before the cooperative rectification working group should have been to support their action of running the cooperative and help them run the cooperative well, starting from cherishing the socialist enthusiasm of the peasants. However, the working group did not do this. They thought that running a cooperative had to look like something, how could three households run a cooperative? So they went to Wang Yukun and said: "You can't run a cooperative with so few households. We approve you to run a mutual aid group!" These words poured cold water on Yukun and the others.

    At this moment, from the surface, the atmosphere of Nanwangzhuang fighting to achieve cooperation seemed to be thinning, but in fact, this struggle never stopped for a moment. That night, Yukun called Xiaoqi and Xiaopang together and said to them: "Those three households are determined to withdraw from the cooperative. The working group said that we have too few households and do not meet the conditions for running a cooperative, and let us run a mutual aid group. I think no matter what it is called, cooperative or group, we should still share the livestock, share the fodder, and collectively do a good job in production." Xiaoqi and Xiaopang both agreed to do so. They continued to do so.
    The news that Yukun, Xiaoqi, and Xiaopang were determined to take the socialist road soon spread to Beijing and to Chairman Mao's ears. Chairman Mao praised their action of loving socialism and asked the Party organization to support them in running the cooperative.

    In early July, the Anping County Committee of the Communist Party of China sent Zhou Qiuxue to help Wang Yukun, Xiaoqi, and Xiaopang run the cooperative. On July 18, Yukun, Xiaoqi, Xiaopang, and Zhou Qiuxue of the county Party committee held a meeting. When Zhou Qiuxue explained that the leadership supported them in running a small cooperative, the three of them became excited. Yukun said: "Ever since they said they wanted to turn us into a group, I haven't been at peace for the past twenty days! I always thought: the road pointed out by the Party cannot be blocked by others, and that's really the case."

    Then, everyone discussed how to run the cooperative well. The result of the discussion was that the most important thing was to do a good job in production. Even though there were insufficient means of production, they had to increase production compared to last year and surpass the farmers outside the cooperative.

    Summer is a season of many disasters. Locusts were born in the two mu of late millet land in the northwest of the village. As soon as the ears came out, they were finished after a bite. Wang Yukun was very anxious about this and quickly bought "666" powder to control them. After the first treatment, they were born again soon, even more than the first time. Yukun and the others went to spread the powder again. After the second treatment, they were born again soon. Yukun and the others were still determined to control them. As a result, their two mu of millet were not damaged at all. Wang Zhibin, an individual farmer whose early millet land was next to this land, had his millet ears destroyed because the treatment was not good. After the autumn, Yukun and the others harvested 150 jin per mu, while Wang Zhibin's early millet only harvested 50 or 60 jin per mu.

    On a hot noon, the crops were all curled up by the sun. In the cornfield northwest of Nanwangzhuang Village, two people were waving hoes to fight against weeds, one was Xiaoqi and the other was Xiaopang. At this time, it was always raining, and the weeds were growing vigorously. Yukun and the others were determined to weed the weeds clean. When others went to rest under the trees, they were still weeding the land. The forty mu of land in the cooperative was weeded clean by them. Wang Luodai's land outside the cooperative was next to the cooperative's land, and he couldn't weed it all, and it was full of weeds.

    Running production in the cooperative requires spending some money. Where did they get the money? They proposed to save expenses and not spend an extra penny. In the long months, their expenses were only a few taels of cottonseed oil and a bottle of ink. Before the autumn harvest, the government saw that they were really in difficulties in production and lent them more than 200 yuan to buy a large cart. This kind of assistance was a great encouragement to them.

    They fought against various difficulties with the greatest perseverance, and finally achieved increased production. Last year, when they were farming individually, their three households' forty mu of land yielded 950 jin of millet, 1,600 jin of corn, 1,300 jin of peanuts, 450 jin of cotton, and 3,000 jin of sweet potatoes, totaling 6,580 jin of raw grain; this year, the entire cooperative harvested 1,800 jin of millet, 1,980 jin of corn, 2,000 jin of peanuts, 700 jin of cotton, and 5,000 jin of sweet potatoes, totaling 9,950 jin of raw grain, an increase of more than 50% compared to last year. The actual income of the three households has increased a lot. After deducting expenses, each household increased by more than 1,100 jin of grain compared to last year. It is also much stronger than the farmers outside the cooperative. The production conditions of Wang Luohe, a household that withdrew from the cooperative, were similar to those of Yukun and the others. He fell ill during the busy farming season, and the land was full of weeds. On average, each mu of land (a total of 19 mu) could only harvest 150 jin of grain, which was more than 90 jin less per mu.

    When Yukun and the others started to run the cooperative, the wealthy households outside the cooperative mocked them, saying that they were a "large cooperative." Their heroic spirit of resolutely taking the road of agricultural cooperation and the fact of increased production in the autumn harvest finally convinced people, and no one mocked them anymore. The sarcastic words like "large cooperative" were never heard again.

    When the county leadership supported Wang Yukun and other households in running the cooperative, they also reorganized the Party branch in Nanwangzhuang. Wang Wenzhang, the secretary of the branch who was determined to take the capitalist road, was expelled from the Party.
    Chairman Mao's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" spread to the vast countryside and also to Nanwangzhuang. When Yukun heard that Chairman Mao had praised them, he excitedly told Xiaoqi and Xiaopang's families as if he was reporting good news. When Xiaoqi's mother heard the good news, her eyes were filled with tears. She said: "Chairman Mao also knows about our cooperative! Chairman Mao really cares about us!" She instructed Xiaoqi to listen to Chairman Mao's words and run the cooperative well. The Party branch conveyed Chairman Mao's instructions to the farmers, and Nanwangzhuang was boiling. The activists among the Party members, Youth League members, and poor peasants stood up tall. Yukun, Xiaoqi, and Xiaopang did not care about resting at all, and used their own personal experience to persuade farmers to join the cooperative. In a few short days, they strung together nine farmers to sign up to join the cooperative. The households that had originally joined the cooperative and then withdrew from the cooperative are now awakened and are also actively requesting to join the cooperative. Some of the upper-middle peasants who were originally skeptical about running the cooperative and had withdrawn from the cooperative have also resolutely chosen to take the road of cooperation.

    The headquarters for guiding the cooperative, the cooperative establishment preparatory committee, was organized, and Wang Yukun was elected by everyone as the deputy director of the preparatory committee. The farmers in the entire village signed up to join the cooperative with excitement. Now, there are 280 farming households in the entire village who have joined the cooperative, accounting for 85% of the total farming households in the entire village. "We must run the cooperative well, and tell Chairman Mao about the achievements of running the large cooperative after the autumn of next year." The cooperative cadres and cooperative members encouraged each other in this way.

    Nanwangzhuang is such a lovely village, and Wang Yukun, Wang Xiaoqi, Wang Xiaopang, and others are such resolute figures on the socialist road. From here, we can see very clearly the direction of the 500 million peasants in our country. We wish them to advance bravely on the road of agricultural cooperation and achieve even greater victories. (Attached pictures)

    积极地有计划地开展农业合作化运动
　　五亿农民的方向
    ——记河北省安平县南王庄三户贫农坚持办社的经过
　　李凯　庆琛一
    毛主席在“关于农业合作化问题”的报告中说：“河北省有一个很小的合作社只有六户，三户老中农坚决不想再干下去，结果让他们走了；三户贫农则表示无论如何要继续干下去，结果让他们留下，社的组织也保存了。其实，这三户贫农所表示的方向，就是全国五亿农民的方向。一切个体经营的农民，终归是要走这三户贫农所坚决地选择了的道路的。”
    毛主席在这里所说的，就是安平县南王庄贫农王玉坤、王小其和王小庞举办的农业生产合作社。
    十一月二十一日，我们怀着兴奋的心情，访问了这个农业生产合作社。在这个村子里，呈现在我们眼前的是一片新的气象：清晨，三五成群的男女社员们，冒着阵阵冷风抢扫树叶，他们正在为冬季积肥做准备；傍晚，从四面八方耕地回家的农民，在一条窄长的街上，形成了长长的行列。他们在相互询问着一天的生产成绩。这村的干部告诉我们：
  “最近有二百多户个体农民报名参加了农业生产合作社，社员们为了争取明年的丰收，开展了带熟地入社运动，到明天（二十四日）四千七百亩白地就耕完了。可是，去年我们村却让大雪封住了五百多亩生地呢？”
      “听毛主席的话，走玉坤他们走的道路，参加合作社，办好合作社”成了这村农民的中心话题。入社的农民都那么喜气洋洋，露着笑脸。村建社筹备委员会的干部，有的在和社员商量着评议农具，有的翻着账本规划土地。党的支部书记王米贵对我们说：“你们春天来，一定看不到这种情况，那时，不少富裕农民闹退社，生产可不带劲啦！这会小社合并成大社，退社的农民又回到社里来了，生产可变了样子……”
    短短的一年里，南王庄起了天翻地覆的变化。二
    一九五四年秋天，河北省农业合作化运动的高潮就到来了。安平县南王庄原来只有三个小社，当时迅速地建成了两个中社和六个小社。参加社的户数，由二十一户增到了二百六十四户。参加农业生产合作社的贫农王玉坤（党员）、王小其、王小庞，表现了高涨的社会主义热情，他们带头入社，想尽一切办法把社办好。但有些参加合作社的富裕农民是想到社里来找便宜，他们表面上积极，却不是真心办社，他们暗中有个人的打算。当时支部书记王文章（上中农）不按党的政策办事，只代表了富裕农民的利益，在他所领导的中社里，十四个队干部，就有十个是上中农。贫农王玉坤、王小其和王小庞就参加到他们这个社里。社刚刚成立，社员们根据大部分社员有牲口、有饲草的情况，决定社员的牲口折价归社。有牲口的贫农和下中农社员，在一个下午，就带头把自己的牲口牵到了社里。王文章等富裕农民却不把骡子牵到社里来。这还不算，社干部们还提出让带牲口入社的贫农、下中农把全部饲草都交到社里，调剂给草少的队
  （草少的队是自留骡子多的队），留下骡子的富裕农民，却留下百分之三十的草。王玉坤和别的贫农社员向王文章等这种代表富裕农民利益、损害贫农利益的行为进行了坚决的斗争。王文章一提出骡子不入社，玉坤就找王文章说：“富裕户的骡子不入社，让贫农的牲口给种，这叫什么道理？”王文章一看不妙，偷偷地把骡子卖掉了。为牲口的饲草问题，王玉坤又质问社干部：“入了牲口的还得多拿草，不入牲口的倒少拿草，你们光为富裕农民打算，为什么不想想贫农？”王文章狡猾地说：“这是互助友爱。”玉坤问他：“让贫农拿草时讲友爱，贫农缺粮吃，为啥不让富裕户讲友爱？”说的王文章无话可答。社里的党员干部，不光没有检查自己的资本主义思想，有的甚至不干工作（如王文章），有的就打击王玉坤。在王玉坤死了孩子情绪不好的时候，他们向县委反映王玉坤工作消极、挡党的政策（就是指不执行他们少数党员干部损害贫农利益的意见）。在有县委派人参加的支委会上，玉坤揭露了他们这种丧失阶级立场的错误。他们打击王玉坤的计划失败了。
    到今年春天，一些富裕农民不积极生产，还到处散布谣风：“社不能再办下去了！”“办社影响生产啦！”“划小社吧！划小了就能办了！”但这个社里的许多贫农、下中农都决心办社，问题是需要改造党的支部，需要树立贫农在社里的优势。不过，到这村领导整社的干部，听了少数富裕农民的意见，就草率确定把这个中型社以队为单位划分成了七个小社，王玉坤、王小其、王小庞和中农王振槐、王振福、王洛合共六户划为一个小社。三
    领导整社的干部，满以为划分成小社就可以办下去了。同他们的愿望相反，小社里闹退社的问题，接二连三的发生。原来有些富裕农民，并不是真心办小社，他们的企图是“大社化小，小社化了”。生产队长王文双（上中农），在没有划分小社以前，曾向整社干部保证：只要划成小社，我保证能领导好。果真划成小社了，他又借口干不了，让社员们重新选社干部。不少社员打算选李五
  （党员）当社长，他却让社员们选思想落后的王旦旦。王旦旦不会领导，有事王文双又不管。不久，这个社就垮台了。
    在上中农嚷嚷退社的时候，一部分党员、团员和贫农中的积极分子，继续沿着党所指引的道路前进，王玉坤、王小其、王小庞走在这个队伍的最前列。当时，在王玉坤社里，两条道路的斗争也在猛烈地进行着。合作社在社员王振槐（上中农）的地里种着四亩八分麦子，长得很是出色。王振槐每逢走到地边，就打起了小算盘：六户里只有这几亩好麦子，和贫农们在一起办社，真是吃亏。他一看到有的小社垮了台，就同另一户社员王振福（中农，他的兄弟）商量退社，中农王洛合看到有两户退社的，也提出退社。王玉坤经常耐心地给他们讲方向、讲政策，说服他们留在社里，可是他们说：“现在我们还不走这条道，先看看再说。”
    五月里，玉坤、小其、小庞开了一次会。玉坤坚定地向他俩说：“党告诉我们：要大家富裕，自己也富裕，就要坚持领导农民办社。我听党的话，一定办下去，你们呢？”小其说：“我也是早打定主意了，像我这样的户，除了参加社，再没有别的路。”小庞也说：“单干的罪我是受够了。让他们退吧！只要你们办，我坚决跟你们一块走。”他们这种办社的决心，产生了巨大的力量。他们商量好，如果那三户坚决退社，社里的两头牛，他们要伙分一头，凭着三条身子一头牛，继续办下去。
    不久，县区整社工作组到这村来整社。在整社会上，工作组问大家打算怎样办？王振槐、王振福、王洛合都提出退社，王玉坤、王小其、王小庞三人坚定地回答：他们退了社，我们也坚决办。
    王玉坤、王小其、王小庞为什么一定要坚决办社？下面的情况可以告诉我们：
    王玉坤是个受尽旧社会摧残的壮年人，在土地改革前，他是村里数一数二的贫农，为了生活，不得不给地主当长工。只是因为土地改革，他分得了土地，生活才逐渐地好起来。他在土地改革斗争中最积极，光荣地被吸收为共产党员。土地改革后，因为是个体生产，虽说有十几亩地，可是什么农具也没有，牲口也只有半头。生产搞不好，产量很低，十几亩地也不过能收一千多斤粮食，一家好几口人，生活还是不富裕。党发展农业合作化的政策，给他指出了方向，也给了他无限的力量。去年合作化运动中，他就积极带动农民办社。
    王小其是青年团员，他和他的母亲永远不会忘记土地改革前辛酸的日子。那时候他的父亲死去了，母亲领着他过日子，经常缺吃少穿。土地改革后，生活比以前改善了，可是什么农具也没有。牲口呢？也不过一条牛腿。他年纪又小，不懂得种地技术，土地产量也很低，一家人的生活总是巴巴结结。当着党指出农业合作化的道路是农民摆脱贫困的唯一正确的道路时，他就和母亲商量着带头入社了。
    王小庞：他在小的时候，跟母亲讨过饭。土地改革后，因为缺这少那，地还是种不好。他曾经梦想过怎样使自己的生活富裕起来，可是在个体生产的基础上，怎么也办不到。种地时，因为没有牲口、农具，眼看着土地不能播种；即使勉强种上，因为缺这少那，也经营不好。他经常同共产党员王玉坤等接近，当他了解走合作化的道路才能摆脱贫困的时候，办好合作社的念头在他心里像火焰似的燃烧起来了。在去年的合作化运动中，他和玉坤、小其在一起，成了积极分子。
    当着王玉坤领导的这个小社三户要求退社、三户要坚决办下去的时候，摆在整社工作组面前的任务，应当是从爱护农民的社会主义积极性出发，支持他们办社的行动，帮助他们把社办好。不过，工作组并没有这样做。他们以为办社就得像个样子，三户怎么能办社呢？于是就找到王玉坤说：“你们这么几户，办不成社了，批准你们办个互助组吧！”这一句话给玉坤他们泼了一盆冷水。
    在这个时刻，从表面上看，南王庄为实现合作化而斗争的空气似乎稀薄起来了，实际上，这种斗争一刻也没有间断过。当天晚上，玉坤就把小其、小庞叫在了一起，对他们说：“那三户坚决退社，工作组说咱们户数少，不够办社的条件，让办互助组，我看不管叫社叫组，咱们还是牲口公有，公摊草料，集体把生产搞好。”小其、小庞都同意这样办。他们就这样继续干下去了。四
    玉坤、小其、小庞坚决走社会主义道路的消息，不久传到了北京，传到了毛主席的耳朵里。毛主席赞扬他们这种热爱社会主义的行动，让党的组织支持他们办社。
    七月初，中共安平县委会派周求学帮助王玉坤、小其、小庞办社。七月十八日，玉坤、小其、小庞和县委会的周求学在一起开了个会。当着周求学说明领导上支持他们办小社的时候，他们三人情绪激动了起来。玉坤说：“从一说让转组，这二十天来我心里就不平静啊！我总想：党给指出的这条道，别人是拦不住的，真就是这样啊。”
    接着，大家就研究怎样把社办好。商量的结果，最要紧的一条就是搞好生产，虽说生产资料不足，也要做到比去年增产，超过社外的农民。
    夏季是个多灾的季节，村西北的二亩晚谷地里生了蚂蚱，穗子刚刚出来，一咬就完了。王玉坤很为这事焦急，赶紧买来“六六六”粉除治。第一遍除治完了，不久又生出来，比第一次还多。玉坤他们又去撒药粉。第二遍除治完了，不久又生出来。玉坤他们还是坚决除治。结果，他们这二亩谷子一点没有受损失，挨着这块地的个体农民王治斌的早谷，因为治的不好，谷穗被吃毁了。秋后，玉坤他们这块地每亩收了一百五十斤，王治斌的早谷，每亩才收了五、六十斤。
    在一个炎热的中午，庄稼都晒的卷起叶子，在南王庄村西北的玉米地里，有两个人挥动锄头和杂草搏斗，一个是小其，一个是小庞。这时，总是落雨，杂草一个劲地长，玉坤他们决心把草锄干净。别人去树下歇晌了，他们还是锄地。社里的四十亩地被他们锄的净光。社外农民王洛代的地和社里的地挨着，锄不过来，长的满地是草。
    社里搞生产需要花一些钱，他们哪里有钱呢？他们提出要节省开支，不多花一文钱。在漫长的几个月里，他们的开支，只是几两棉油和一瓶墨水。收秋前，政府见到他们生产上实在困难，贷给他们二百多元，买了一辆大车。这种援助，对他们是一个很大的鼓励。
    他们就是这样用最大的毅力向各种困难斗争着，终于实现了增产。去年单干时，他们三户的四十亩地收了九百五十斤谷子，一千六百斤玉米，一千三百斤花生，四百五十斤棉花，三千斤甘薯，共折合原粮六千五百八十斤；今年全社收了一千八百斤谷子，一千九百八十斤玉米，二千斤花生，七百斤棉花，五千斤甘薯，共折合原粮九千九百五十斤，比去年增产百分之五十多。三户的实际收入都增加不少。除去开支，每户比去年增加了一千一百多斤粮食。同社外农民比也强的多。退社户王洛合的生产条件同玉坤他们差不多，正赶上农忙，他闹起病来，地里长满了草，平均每亩地（共十九亩地）只能收粮一百五十斤，每亩少收九十多斤。
    玉坤他们开始办社时，社外的富裕户叽笑他们，说他们是“大社”。他们坚决走农业合作化道路的英雄气概，秋收增产的事实，终于说服了人们，以后就再没有人叽笑他们，“大社”一类的讽刺话再也听不到了。
    县领导上在支持王玉坤等户办社的时候，对南王庄党的支部也实行了改组。坚决走资本主义道路的支部书记王文章被开除出党。五
    毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的报告传到了广大农村，也传到了南王庄。玉坤听说毛主席表扬了他们，兴奋地像报喜似的告诉给小其、小庞家里。小其他母亲听到这个喜讯，激动得两眼湿润了，她说：“咱办社的事，毛主席也知道了！毛主席可真关心咱们呀！”她嘱咐小其一定要听毛主席的话，把社办好。党的支部向农民们传达了毛主席的指示，南王庄沸腾起来了。积极办社的党员、团员和贫农中的积极分子们，挺起了胸膛。玉坤、小其、小庞一点也顾不得休息，用自己的亲身经历，说服农民入社。短短的几天里，他们就串连九户农民报名入社。原来入社又退社的户，现在觉悟了，也积极要求入社了。原来对办社怀疑以及退社的上中农，有的也坚决地选择了走合作化的道路。
    指导办社的司令部——建社筹备委员会组织起来了，王玉坤被大家推选为筹备委员会的副主任。全村农民怀着兴奋的心情报名入社。现在全村入社农户已有二百八十户，占全村总农户的百分之八十五。“咱一定要把社办好，到明年秋后，把办大社的成绩告诉给毛主席。”社干部们、社员们都这样互相勉励着。
    南王庄，是这样一个可爱的村庄，王玉坤、王小其、王小庞等，是这样坚定地走社会主义道路的人物。从这里，我们非常清楚地看到了我国五亿农民的方向，我们预祝他们在农业合作化的道路上英勇前进，获得更大更大的胜利。（附图片）
