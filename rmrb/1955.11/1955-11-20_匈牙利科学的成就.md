　　Achievements of Hungarian Science
　　Academician Lei Bogenar, Secretary-General of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences
    In 1825, the great Hungarian reformer and scholar, Count István Széchenyi, founded the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. The involvement of famous scientists, poets, and writers of the time, such as Ferenc Kölcsey, Mihály Vörösmarty, János Arany, and Loránd Eötvös, brought great prestige to the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. However, this prestige later faded, especially during the Horthy regime, when science retreated into an ivory tower. A typical example of this period was the selection of Joseph, a Habsburg prince who was scientifically illiterate, as the President of the Academy.
    Since the liberation of Hungary, the situation in science has been completely different. The Hungarian Academy of Sciences, occupying a prominent position in society, has begun to develop substantially. While research work has undergone fundamental development, Hungarian science has also shifted its attention to the practical use of new scientific achievements to promote the development of industry and agriculture, increase production and yields, and improve the living standards of the people. The planned working methods and the close integration of science with life illustrate the tremendous progress of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences since 1945. The Academy now has twenty-three research institutes, compared to only four in 1948. The Hungarian Academy of Sciences also provides assistance to departments in universities and colleges, and to industrial and agricultural research institutions.
    Science and National Construction
    In the past few years, the central goal of our country has been to build a modern Hungarian industry. This fact has also promoted the upsurge of technical science research. To strengthen development in this area, we have specifically established industrial research institutes.
    For example, the new coal mining method now being promoted throughout the country was successfully researched by the scientific research institute. A national water supply plan has been completed; the modernization of cast iron and steelmaking technologies and the research on manufacturing "titanium iron" are proceeding successfully. Significant achievements have been made in mineral geology and in the improvement of geophysical research methods, as well as in improving measurement methods and instruments. Our scientists' research methods in inorganic and analytical chemistry have been adopted by many countries. Some of our achievements in physics and organic chemistry have been recognized internationally.
    Researchers at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences are working hard to improve soil using new methods and are engaged in testing improved varieties to increase crop yields. For example, the new hybrid corn variety can increase yields by 20% to 30% compared to existing varieties. Much work has also been done in livestock research. In addition, the Academy encourages the promotion of Michurin's theories in biology.
    The names of Lipót Fejér, Frigyes Riesz, and their students have long been famous throughout the world for their mathematical writings. The Hungarian Institute of Applied Mathematics is largely responsible for the progress in the practical application of mathematics. New schools of algebra and probability calculus have been developed. Applied mathematics has been applied to meet the power needs of factories, determine the most economical speed of textile machines, and design suspension bridge projects.
    In theoretical physics, specialized research has been conducted on the theory of atomic statistics and relativity. The recent establishment of the Hungarian Central Institute of Physics has promoted research in experimental physics.
    The establishment of atomic reactors and the research on the peaceful use of atomic energy are important tasks for Hungarian scientists. In this regard, they have received assistance from Soviet scientists. Research is currently being conducted using radioactive isotopes supplied by the Soviet Union.
    Similar achievements have been made in the research of cardiac surgery, vascular diseases, and nervous system diseases.
    Activities of the Academy's Institutes
    Our historical scientists are using Marxist viewpoints to define certain periods in Hungarian history and are compiling a history of the Hungarian People's Republic. Researchers at the Institute of Historical Sciences have begun to work with their counterparts in neighboring countries to study common historical issues in Eastern Europe. For example, this cooperation, built on a solid foundation of friendship, has brought good results to the friendly relations between Hungary and Czechoslovakia.
    Major issues in our economy occupy an important place in the work of the Institute of Political Economy, which publishes the scientific journal "Economic Review." The works of János Apáczai-Csere and György Bessenyei (representatives of the early academic school of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries), Kölcsey, Vörösmarty, and Arany (outstanding poets of the nineteenth century) are being studied by literary historians, but at the same time, due attention is also being paid to twentieth-century Hungarian literature. The Hungarian Academy of Sciences has published the complete works of the great Hungarian poet Sándor Petőfi and the modern Hungarian lyric poet Endre Ady as part of a literary series. This series will fill a long-standing gap in our literary history.
    In the past four years, the Hungarian Academy of Sciences Press has published more than twenty language dictionaries. László Országh's "Hungarian-English Dictionary" includes 88,000 words. A new Hungarian dictionary that explains word meanings etymologically is being compiled. In the past four years, twenty dictionaries have been published, including Sándor Eckhardt's "French-Hungarian Dictionary" which includes 280,000 words. The "Russian-Hungarian and Hungarian-Russian Dictionaries" compiled by László Hadrovics and László Gáldi have also been published. In 1954, plans were made to publish the "Hungarian Encyclopedia." In 1954, the Hungarian Academy of Sciences published seventy-seven books, while the average annual publication number from 1930 to 1945 was only ten. The Hungarian Academy of Sciences currently publishes fifty-seven journals, twenty of which are published in English, French, Russian, and German.
    The Academy's congresses are an important form of activity for the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. In 1954, the Biological Society held a meeting and convened congresses on hygiene, meteorology, metrology, law, and political science. Foreign dignitaries and famous academicians congratulated the congress, and young researchers with great prospects were given ample opportunity to report their research results at the congress.
      International Connections
    The important works of members of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences have aroused great interest abroad. In the German Democratic Republic, the "Overthrow of Common Sense" (which won the highest-level Kossuth Prize in the country), a philosophical work by the Hungarian philosopher György Lukács exposing irrational philosophy, Frigyes Riesz and Béla Szőkefalvi-Nagy's "Lectures on Functional Analysis", Bence Szabolcsi's "Folk Music and History", Dániel Fejér's "Soil Biology", Béla Issekutz and Arisztid Kovács' "Research Methods in Experimental Pharmaceutical Science", Kovács and Ráz's "Instability Phenomena of Alternators", Béla Fogarasi's "Logic", Rezső Manninger, József Marek, and József Mócsy's "Textbook of Veterinary Diagnostics" and Terezh's "Rolling Mills and Forging Machines" have been published. In Czechoslovakia, Rezső Manninger's "Internal Medicine" has been published. In London, Zoltán Kodály's "Kalla Double Dance" has been published, and choral works by the same author published in Vienna have also been widely circulated. Imre Littmann and Lénárd Vorná's "Congenital Heart and Vascular Irregularities" has been translated and published in the Soviet Union.
    The Hungarian Academy of Sciences is responsible for establishing close international scientific exchanges with scientific circles in other countries. Its scientific cooperation with the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies is well known. The Hungarian Academy of Sciences has joined many international organizations and has regained new membership in other organizations. The fact that the Hungarian Academy of Sciences Library exchanges journals with 1,075 libraries and research institutes in other countries proves its extensive international contacts.
    The Hungarian Science Congress, which has already been held in 1955, affirmed the achievements our country has made in science in the past decade. Professor István Rusznyák, President of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, said that Hungarian scientists support policies aimed at safeguarding peaceful construction work. They oppose the monopolization of scientists and scientific inventions for the purposes of war and inhumanity. We Hungarian scientists are making all creative efforts to safeguard peace and strive for a better future for our people and all mankind.

　　匈牙利科学的成就
　　匈牙利科学院秘书长科学院院士　雷·波格纳尔
    一八二五年，匈牙利的伟大改革家和学者——康特·伊斯特万·希切尼创立了匈牙利科学院。由于当时的著名科学家、诗人和作家如菲林茨·柯尔采、米海·维略士马尔蒂、雅诺士·阿拉尼以及罗兰德·尤托沃斯都和科学院发生了来往，因此也就给匈牙利科学院带来了极高的声望。但是后来这种声望暗淡下来了，尤其是在霍尔第统治时期，科学退入了象牙之塔。这一时期科学上的典型表现是选择了一个在科学上不学无术的哈布斯堡皇子约瑟夫作为科学院院长。
    自从匈牙利解放以后，科学事业的情况是完全不同了，在社会上占有显著地位的匈牙利科学院开始得到了长足的发展。和研究工作获得根本发展的同时，匈牙利的科学也把注意力转移到实际利用科学上的新成就以促进工农业的发展，提高产量与收获量和改进人民的生活水平上面。采取有计划的工作方法，以及科学与生活紧密结合的事实，说明自从一九四五年以来匈牙利科学院的巨大进步。现在科学院附设有二十三个研究所，而在一九四八年却只有四个。匈牙利科学院也对高等学校中的系科和工农业研究机构进行帮助。
    科学和国家建设
    在过去几年里，建成现代化的匈牙利工业是我国的中心目标。这一事实也就促成了技术科学研究工作的高涨。为了加强这方面的发展，我们特别成立了工业研究所。
    例如，现在推广到全国的新式采煤法，就是科学研究所研究成功的。一项全国范围内的供水计划已经制定完成；铸铁和制钢技术的现代化以及制造“钛铁齐”的研究工作正在成功地进行着。在矿物地质学方面和在地球物理学研究法的改良上，以及在改进测量法和仪器方面都已获得显著的成就。我国科学家在无机和分析化学上的研究方法，已被许多国家采纳。我们在物理学和有机化学上的某些成就，已经得到了国际上的公认。
    匈牙利科学院的研究员们正在努力利用新法改良土壤和从事于改进新品种的试验工作，以便提高农作物的收获量。例如新品种的杂交玉蜀黍，能比原有品种的产量提高百分之二十到三十。在牧畜业的研究上也作了许多工作。此外，科学院还鼓励着在生物学上推广米丘林学说。
    利波特·费耶尔、夫列基斯·李斯和他们的门生的名字，由于他们在数学上的著述而早已驰名世界。匈牙利的应用数学研究所在数学的实际应用的进展上负有很大的责任。代数和概率微积分学中新的学派已经获得发展。应用数学已应用到满足工厂的动力需要、决定纺织机的最经济速度和吊桥工程的设计上面。
    在理论物理学方面，已对原子统计学和相对论的理论作了专门的研究工作。由于最近匈牙利中央物理学研究所的建立，已经促进了实验物理学的研究工作。
    原子反应堆的建立和和平利用原子能的研究工作，是匈牙利科学家的重要任务。在这方面，他们已经有了苏联科学家的帮助。目前还正在利用苏联供给的放射性同位素进行着研究工作。
    在心脏手术、脉管病症和神经系统疾病的研究上，也获得了同样的成就。
    科学院各研究所的活动
    我国的历史科学家们正在以马克思主义观点来确定匈牙利历史上的某些时期，并编写匈牙利人民共和国的历史。历史科学研究所的研究员们已开始和邻近各国的同行合力研究东欧共同的历史问题。举例来说，建立在巩固的友谊基础上的这种合作，已经给匈牙利同捷克斯洛伐克的友好关系带来了很好的结果。
    我国经济中的重大问题在政治经济学研究所的工作中占着重要的地位，这个研究所出版着科学期刊“经济评论”。雅诺士·阿巴柴—切利和格奥尔基·别塞恩耶夫（十七和十八世纪早期学院派的代表者），柯尔采、维略士马尔蒂和阿拉尼（十九世纪的卓越诗人）的作品正由文学史家研究着，但是在这同时也没有忽略了对二十世纪匈牙利文学应有的关切。匈牙利科学院出版了匈牙利的伟大诗人山陀尔·裴多菲和现代匈牙利抒情诗人恩德尔·阿第的全集，作为文学丛书的一部分。这部丛书将补足我国文学史上长久停滞的缺陷。
    在过去的四年多里，匈牙利科学院出版社出版了二十多部语文字典。拉兹洛·欧萨编著的“匈英字典”，包括有八万八千个字。一本从语源学上解释字义的新匈牙利语字典正在编纂中。在过去的四年里共出版了二十部字典，其中包括由山陀尔·伊斯克哈特编著的收入了二十八万字的“法匈字典”。由拉兹罗·哈德罗维斯和拉兹罗·格尔第编著的“俄匈和匈俄字典”也已出版。一九五四年已制定计划出版“匈牙利大百科全书”。一九五四年，匈牙利科学院出版了七十七种书籍，而一九三零到一九四五年每年的平均出版数只有十种。匈牙利科学院目前出版着五十七种期刊，其中的二十种用英文、法文、俄文和德文四种语文出版。
    科学院代表大会是匈牙利科学院活动的重要形式。一九五四年生物学会举行了会议，并召开了卫生学、气象学、度量衡学、法律和政治科学等方面的大会。国外的贵宾和著名的科学院士向大会祝贺，有远大前程的青年研究家们也获得了充分机会在大会上报告他们的研究成果。
      国际联系
    匈牙利科学院成员们的重要著作，已经引起了国外人士的极大兴趣。在德意志民主共和国出版了匈牙利哲学家格奥尔基·鲁卡奇的暴露非理性哲学的“常识的推翻”（曾在国内获得科苏特奖金的最高级奖），夫列基斯·列兹和贝拉·佐科伐尔维·纳吉的“机能分析教程”，本泽·萨波尔齐的“民间音乐与历史”，丹涅尔·菲耶尔的“土壤生物学”，贝拉·伊塞库兹和阿里斯蒂德·科瓦斯的“实验药物科学研究法”，科瓦斯和拉兹的“交流发电机的不稳定现象”，贝拉·弗格罗西的“逻辑”，列佐·马宁格尔，约瑟夫·马里克和约瑟夫·慕西的“家畜疾病诊断学教科书”和捷列日的“辊辗工场和锻铁机”。在捷克斯洛伐克出版了列佐·马宁格尔的“内科用药”。在伦敦出版了佐尔丹·科达伊的“考拉双人舞”，在维也纳出版的同一作者的合唱乐曲也得到广泛流传。伊姆雷·里特曼和伦奈·弗诺合著的“先天性心脏与血管的不规则”一书已在苏联翻译和出版。
    匈牙利科学院负有和其他各国科学界建立紧密的国际科学交流的责任。它同苏联与人民民主国家在科学上的合作是众所周知的。匈牙利科学院已加入了许多国际组织，在其他组织里也重新取得了新的会员资格。匈牙利科学院图书馆和其他国家的一千零七十五个图书馆和研究所交换期刊的这一事实，证明了它在国际上的广泛接触。
    已经在一九五五年举行过的匈牙利科学代表大会，肯定了我国在过去十年中在科学上所获得的成就。匈牙利科学院院长伊斯特万·鲁斯尼雅克教授说过，匈牙利科学家们拥护目的在于维护和平建设劳动的政策。他们反对为了战争和反人道的目的而对科学家和科学发明加以垄断的行为。我们匈牙利科学家为了维护和平和争取我国人民以及全人类的更美好的未来，正在进行一切创造性的努力。
