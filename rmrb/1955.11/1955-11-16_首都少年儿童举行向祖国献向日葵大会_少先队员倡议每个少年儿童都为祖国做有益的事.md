Capital's Children Hold Sunflower Offering Ceremony to the Motherland
Young Pioneers Propose Every Child Do Something Beneficial for the Motherland

More than 1,500 children from the capital held a sunflower offering ceremony to the motherland on the morning of the 13th in the auditorium of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

After Wu Han, Deputy Mayor of Beijing, accepted the 26,388 jin of sunflower seeds grown and harvested by the capital's children for the country this year on behalf of the state, a Young Pioneer stepped onto the stage. Representing the Young Pioneers of six schools, including Beijing No. 47 Middle School, No. 49 Middle School, Yucai Primary School, Fengtai District No. 8 Central Primary School, Shawo Primary School, and Dongbeiwang Primary School, he proposed an initiative to all Young Pioneers and children in the city, suggesting that every child should do something beneficial to realize the country's first Five-Year Plan. They suggested that every child plant a sunflower or castor bean each year, plant trees according to possible conditions, and collect tree seeds, scrap copper, scrap iron, and waste paper, as well as used ink bottles, toothpaste tubes, apricot kernels, and broken rubber shoe soles. Children living in rural areas should help farmers accumulate fertilizer, pick up grain, weed, and eliminate pests. All children should also save water, electricity, grain, stationery paper, pocket money, and take care of public property such as books, desks, chairs, and glass.

This initiative was immediately met with enthusiastic applause and welcome from all the children present.

Hu Keshi, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, who attended the conference, also spoke on the spot to express his support for the initiative. He said: This initiative is very good. If every child in the country plants a sunflower every year, and each sunflower yields four taels of sunflower seeds, then 19 million jin of sunflower seeds can be harvested in a year, and the oil extracted can feed 800,000 people for a year. If every ten people collect one jin of scrap iron, 3,040 tons of steel can be smelted, and 608 tractors can be made. He said: The children in Beijing should take the lead in these activities, and you should learn to think of the motherland from an early age. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

　　首都少年儿童举行向祖国献向日葵大会
　　少先队员倡议每个少年儿童都为祖国做有益的事
    首都一千五百多名少年儿童，十三日上午在中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会大礼堂，举行向祖国献向日葵大会。
  当北京市副市长吴晗代表国家在会上接受了首都少年儿童们今年为国家种植收获的两万六千三百八十八斤葵花子以后，一个少年先锋队员走上了主席台。他代表北京市第四十七中学、第四十九中学、育才小学、丰台区第八中心小学、沙窝小学和东北旺小学等六个学校的少年先锋队员，向全市的少年先锋队员和少年儿童们提出一项倡议，建议每个少年儿童都要为实现国家的第一个五年计划做些有益的事。他们建议每个少年儿童每年种植一棵向日葵或蓖麻，根据可能条件植树，搜集树种、废铜、废铁、废纸，搜集用过的墨水瓶、牙膏筒和杏核、破胶鞋底等。在农村住的少年儿童帮助农民积肥、拣粮、锄草、除虫。所有的少年儿童们还应该节约水、电、粮食、文具纸张、零用钱以及爱护图书、桌椅、玻璃等公共财物。
    这个倡议，立刻得到全体到会少年儿童们的热烈鼓掌欢迎。
    参加大会的青年团中央委员会书记处书记胡克实也当场发言表示支持这项倡议。他说：这个倡议很好。如果全国每一个小朋友每年种一棵向日葵，每棵收四两葵花子，一年就可收一千九百万斤葵花子，榨出来的油，就可供八十万人吃一年。如果每十个人收集一斤废铁，就可炼成三千零四十吨钢，造成六百零八台拖拉机。他说：北京市的小朋友们要在这些活动中起带头作用，你们应该从小就学会为祖国着想。　　（据新华社讯）
