    Shandong and Jiangsu Provinces Actively Develop Fishery Production Cooperatives
    More than 90% of the 554 fishery production cooperatives in Shandong Province have increased production this year. Led by 154 fishery production cooperatives, fishermen in Rushan County increased production by more than 45% compared to last year, with cooperatives outperforming mutual aid teams and individual households by 15% to 40%. With the help of state loans and the specific guidance of technical extension stations, fishery production cooperatives have more fully utilized collective strength. For example, fishery cooperatives in Rongcheng County generally increased their fish catch by three to four times after adopting advanced fishing methods. The Shawo Village Fishery Cooperative in Weihai once caught more than 14,000 catties of fish in a single net.
    The bumper harvest of fishery production cooperatives is attracting fishermen to take the road of cooperativization. Among the 170 fishery cooperatives in the Wendeng area, 163 have absorbed more than 2,200 fisherman households. Ninety percent of the fishermen in Wanggou Village on Changshan Island have signed up to join cooperatives. Shidao, Rongcheng, Rushan, and Haiyang counties have begun training more than 900 key personnel for establishing cooperatives. (Our correspondent in Jinan)
    By the end of September, Jiangsu Province had developed 84 fishery production cooperatives, with more than 2,700 fisherman households participating. According to an inspection of 54 older cooperatives that went into production in the spring and summer, all of them saw an increase in output compared to the same period last year. Among them, eight cooperatives increased production by more than 50%, forty-one cooperatives increased production by more than 20%, and five cooperatives increased production by about 10%.
    The fact that cooperatives are generally increasing production has not only strengthened the confidence of cooperative members in running the cooperatives but has also inspired the enthusiasm of individual fishermen to join. Since the second half of the year, Ganyu and Zhenze counties alone have developed 30 cooperatives. Recently, fishermen from Danyang, Liyang, and Gaochun counties have been constantly going to the county people's committees to request that people be sent to lead them. Fishermen in Xin Hailian City are flocking to the first and second old cooperatives in Liandao Township to learn how to run cooperatives. In the face of this situation, the Party committees in various fishing areas have begun to strengthen leadership in fishery mutual aid and cooperation. The Rural Work Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Songjiang, Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Nantong, and other local committees have held symposiums for aquatic product cadres or fishery production cooperative directors to study fishery mutual aid and cooperation work. In October, the Hongze District Committee of the Sihong County Committee of the Communist Party of China also held an enlarged meeting of district and township cadres to implement the spirit of "overall planning and strengthened leadership" to the townships. The district plans to develop from the original five cooperatives to 30 cooperatives this winter. (Dong Yan)

    山东江苏两省积极发展渔业生产合作社
    山东省五百五十四处渔业生产合作社，今年有百分之九十以上都增产。乳山县渔民在一百五十四个渔业生产合作社带动下，比去年增产百分之四十五以上，其中合作社又比互助组和单干户增产百分之十五到四十。渔业生产合作社在国家贷款的帮助和技术推广站的具体指导下，更充分地发挥了集体力量。如荣成县的渔业合作社采用了先进捕鱼方法后，捕鱼量一般提高三倍到四倍。威海沙窝村渔业合作社，曾经一网捕鱼一万四千多斤。
    渔业生产合作社的丰收，吸引着渔民走合作化的道路。文登专区一百七十个渔业合作社，已有一百六十三个吸收渔民二千二百多户入社，长山岛王沟村百分之九十的渔民报名入社，石岛、荣成、乳山、海阳县已开始训练办社骨干九百多人。　（本报驻济南记者）
    江苏省渔业生产合作社到九月底已发展到八十四个，入社渔户二千七百多户。据投入春夏季生产的五十四个老社检查，产量均比去年同期增加。其中增产百分之五十以上的八个社，增产百分之二十以上的四十一个社，增产百分之十左右的五个社。
    合作社普遍增产的事实，不但增强了社员办社信心，也启发了单干渔民的入社积极性。下半年以来，仅赣榆、震泽两县就发展了三十个社。丹阳、溧阳、高淳等县最近都不断有渔民到县人民委员会去请求派人领导。新海连市渔民则川流不息的到连岛乡第一、第二两个老社学习办社办法。面对这一情况，各渔区党委已开始加强渔业互助合作的领导。中共江苏省委农村工作部和松江、镇江、苏州、南通等地委都召开了水产干部或渔业生产合作社社长座谈会，研究了渔业互助合作工作。中共泗洪县洪泽区委在十月份并召开了区乡干部扩大会议，把“全面规划，加强领导”的精神贯彻到乡，全区今冬计划从原来五个社发展到三十个社。　（东炎）
