Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, November 24th: Soviet Union Council of Ministers Chairman Bulganin and Soviet Union Supreme Soviet Presidium Member Khrushchev, along with their entourage, arrived in Bombay on the afternoon of the 23rd by plane from Bareilly in Uttar Pradesh for a visit. They were welcomed at Santa Cruz Airport by the Chief Minister of Bombay State, Morarji Desai, and other local senior officials.

Approximately 200,000 Bombay citizens held a rally at the Batel Stadium to welcome the distinguished Soviet guests. The stadium, brightly lit by spotlights, was packed with enthusiastic crowds, and tens of thousands of welcomers stood outside the stadium. The Mayor of Bombay, Puppala, read out the City of Bombay's welcome address to the Soviet guests.

Bulganin then spoke. He was welcomed with warm applause. Bulganin said that your city played an important role in the Indian national liberation movement, enabling India to cast off colonial oppression and gain long-awaited freedom. Now India has become an independent country. Its people have the opportunity to arrange their own destiny. The significance of this event goes far beyond the borders of India. It reflects the enormous changes now taking place in Asia, and the colonial system imposed on the Asian people by external forces is collapsing.

Bulganin said that the Soviet people are very pleased to note that on the extremely important issue of defending peace, the Indian people are at the forefront of the advocates of peaceful coexistence. He said that in this regard, the particularly outstanding role played by the great statesman, Indian Prime Minister Nehru, cannot be overlooked. Nehru's name is closely linked to the struggle of all peoples for peace and for the realization of the principles of peaceful coexistence in international relations.

Bulganin went on to say that the Soviet people welcome India's contribution to the struggle for peace and the resolution of outstanding issues in Asia. The Soviet people are closely and joyfully watching the Indian people's struggle for peace and their efforts to build a new life. The friendship between our two great peoples is a solid bastion of world peace.

Khrushchev then spoke. His words were constantly interrupted by enthusiastic applause.

Khrushchev said that the feeling of warmth that fills our hearts during these days of friendly meetings with the Indian people is beyond description. We have a very deep mutual understanding with you. We are fighting for peace with you. We want to strive for those principles that are so clearly elucidated in the well-known Indian and Chinese declaration. I, like all Soviet people, believe that truth will surely prevail, and peace will surely prevail. To this end, we must work very hard. We should not relax our persevering struggle, and should not relax our efforts to achieve peace throughout the world.

Khrushchev said that we and you are living in this happy era. We are living in mankind's spring, at a time when colonial enslavement is collapsing and the old situation is gone forever. He said that we are pleased that the great Chinese people have achieved a great historical victory, that they have forever broken free from the oppression of the imperialists, and are building their own great people's country. We are pleased that the great Indian people have achieved national independence. Now, all the peoples of Asia and Africa are throwing themselves into the struggle against colonial enslavement. This is a wave that no one can stop! The Soviet people extend a brotherly hand of permanent friendship to the Indian people.

    布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫到孟买访问
    据新华社新德里二十四日电　苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁和苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员赫鲁晓夫以及随行人员在二十三日下午乘飞机从北方省的巴累利到达孟买访问。他们在圣克卢斯机场受到孟买省首席部长莫拉尔吉·德赛和当地其他高级官员的欢迎。
    孟买市民约二十万人在巴特尔体育场举行大会欢迎苏联贵宾们。在强光灯照得通亮的体育场内挤满了热情的群众，体育场外面也站着好几万欢迎的人。孟买市长普帕拉宣读了孟买市致苏联客人的欢迎词。
    接着由布尔加宁讲话。他受到了热烈的掌声的欢迎。布尔加宁说，你们的城市在使印度能够摆脱殖民压迫并且得到长久期待的自由的印度民族解放运动中，发挥了重要的作用。现在印度已经成为一个独立的国家。它的人民有可能自己安排自己的命运。这一事件的重要意义远远超出印度的范围。它反映了现在在亚洲发生的巨大变化，外力强加于亚洲人民身上的殖民制度正在崩溃。
    布尔加宁说，苏联人十分满意地注意到，在保卫和平这一极其重要的问题上，印度人民走在和平共处的拥护者的前列中。他说，在这方面不能不指出伟大的政治家、印度总理尼赫鲁所起的特别卓越的作用，尼赫鲁的名字是同各国人民争取和平、争取在国际关系中实现和平共处的原则的斗争密切地联系在一起的。
    布尔加宁接着说，苏联人民欢迎印度在争取和平和解决亚洲悬而未决的问题上所作的贡献。苏联人民在密切地和欢欣地注视着印度人民争取和平的斗争和建设新生活的努力，我们两国的伟大人民的友谊是世界和平的巩固堡垒。
    赫鲁晓夫接着讲话。他的话不断为热烈的掌声所打断。
    赫鲁晓夫说，在同印度人民友好会见的这几天中充满我们心坎里的那种热情的感觉，是无法用言语来形容的。我们同你们有十分深刻的互相了解。我们同你们一起为和平而斗争。我们要为众所周知的印度和中国的宣言中那样清楚地阐明了的那些原则而奋斗。我和所有的苏联人一样，相信真理一定胜利，和平一定胜利。为此，我们就应当十分努力。应当不要放松坚忍不拔的斗争，不要放松我们争取全世界和平的努力。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们和你们是生活在这个幸福的时代。我们过着人类的春天，处在这个殖民奴役崩溃、旧日的情况已经一去不复返的时候。他说，我们感到愉快的是：伟大的中国人民取得了伟大的历史性胜利，他们永远摆脱了帝国主义者的压迫，并且正在建设自己伟大的人民的国家。我们感到愉快的是：伟大的印度人民取得了民族独立。现在，亚非两洲的全体人民都在投入反对殖民奴役的斗争。这是任何人都不能阻挡的浪潮！苏联人民向印度人民伸出永久友好的兄弟的手。
