Observer's Commentary

    Every time there are signs of further easing of international tensions, people tend to notice a countercurrent from the United States, trying to create new difficulties on the road to easing international tensions. This is almost a rule. The situation with the Sino-American talks is no exception.

    The Sino-American talks have been discussing the second item on the agenda, "other practical issues in dispute between the two sides," for more than two months. People are eagerly expecting the talks to make concrete contributions to easing the tension between China and the United States. People's hope has its basis. Two months ago, when the Sino-American talks began to discuss the second item on the agenda, the Chinese side proposed "the embargo issue" and "the issue of preparing for higher-level Sino-American negotiations" as two topics on the second item. Lifting the embargo is the unanimous demand of people of all countries to carry out trade. The proposal to hold higher-level Sino-American negotiations is a concrete effort made by China to seek peaceful resolution of disputes between China and the United States without resorting to force, especially to ease and eliminate tensions in the Taiwan area. India's "Today" newspaper expressed the demands of the vast majority of people in the world in its editorial on November 11. It welcomed the steps taken by China in the Geneva talks with the United States, and it believed that the United States "cannot back down" on the second item on the agenda now.

    However, there are signs that the United States is precisely backing down. Recently, old tunes hindering the progress of Sino-American talks have been heard from the United States again. According to a report by the United Press International on November 9, U.S. officials in Washington claimed that the United States would not participate in any other agreement until all Americans were released. The report also said that U.S. officials claimed that the United States was very dissatisfied with China's slow release of American citizens it detained.

    People remember that as early as September 14, when the Sino-American talks should have begun to discuss the second item on the agenda, U.S. officials had claimed: "It would be too early to discuss other issues until the agreed-upon statement on the repatriation of civilians is fulfilled." After that, the United States apparently realized that this extremely unreasonable attitude could not be maintained for long; therefore, the Sino-American talks finally entered the discussion of the second item on the agenda. However, now this old tune that hinders the progress of the talks has reappeared. This cannot but arouse people's vigilance.

    Currently, among the Americans in China, there are indeed fourteen Americans who have broken the law and are serving their sentences in accordance with Chinese law. The remaining law-abiding American expatriates, like any other law-abiding foreigners, do not have any problem of being detained by China at all. As long as there are no pending matters, they can always leave the country at any time. Even for Americans who have broken the law in China, China has always adopted a lenient policy, reducing their sentences and releasing them early based on their crimes and performance. From the beginning of the Sino-American ambassadorial talks on August 1 to the period when the Sino-American talks reached an agreement on the first item on September 10, China released eleven Americans who had broken the law in advance and specifically notified the U.S. side that twelve American expatriates who had applied to leave the country could leave the country. When the first item on the agenda was agreed, China specifically notified the U.S. side that it would release and deport ten Americans who had broken the law in advance. After that, China successively released five Americans who had broken the law and quickly approved the departure of three American expatriates who had recently applied to leave the country. Therefore, since the Sino-American talks began, China has released twenty-six Americans who have broken the law and approved the departure of fifteen American expatriates. That is to say, all Americans in China who want to return to their country have exercised their right to return; even for those Americans who have broken the law, the number of people released by China since the Sino-American talks began accounts for two-thirds of all American prisoners detained at that time. This fully shows that the so-called "slow" accusation against the Chinese side is completely unfounded.

    If we want to raise the issue of "slowness," then it is precisely the United States that should be blamed. In the process of the Sino-American talks, the U.S. side could not but admit that many Chinese students and overseas Chinese had applied to leave the country long ago, but the U.S. government had long prevented them from leaving the United States. The U.S. side also handed over a list of some of these people in the talks. Of course, these lists did not include all the Chinese students and overseas Chinese who had long applied to return to their country. For example, the Chinese students who publicly wrote to the U.S. President on September 2, 1954, requesting permission to leave the country were not all included. However, even with these lists submitted by the U.S. side itself, only one person left the United States and returned to China from August 1 to September 10, and only eight people returned to China after the agreement was reached on September 10, and there are still thirty-eight people who have not returned to their country. Since the Sino-American talks began until now, only less than one-fifth of the Chinese students and overseas Chinese who have been acknowledged by the United States as having applied to return to their country have returned to their country. If we consider the fact that there are tens of thousands of overseas Chinese in the United States, then the proportion of overseas Chinese and students who have returned to China from the United States in all Chinese in the United States who are willing to return to their country is even more insignificant.

    Moreover, the issue of the return of civilians from both sides is by no means just a matter of some proportional figures. The issues of the return of expatriates from China and the United States are two issues of very different natures. The Americans currently serving sentences in China who cannot temporarily exercise their right to return to their country are Americans who have violated Chinese law. The U.S. side knows very well about their crimes. Some of the Americans who broke the law who were recently released early and deported also clearly described their own crimes. Obviously, Americans who have broken the law must be reviewed and processed in accordance with Chinese legal procedures before they can exercise their right to return to their country. Even for these Americans who have broken the law, China is expediting the review of their cases one by one to determine appropriate measures. On the other hand, the Chinese who have been prevented from returning to their country by the U.S. government for a long time are innocent Chinese overseas Chinese and students. They have not committed any crimes, and their only crime is that they demand to return to their country. Since the Sino-American talks have reached an agreement on the issue of the return of civilians from both sides, the U.S. government should take measures to enable these innocent Chinese overseas Chinese and students to return to their country immediately. The United States has not made active efforts in this regard, but groundlessly raises accusations against the Chinese side. This cannot but be regarded as a deliberate distortion of facts, reversal of right and wrong, and a pretext to delay and obstruct the progress of the Sino-American talks.

    Facts cannot be distorted. People cannot allow the United States to create new difficulties on the road to progress in the Sino-American talks. If the United States has the sincerity to solve the problem, it should stop making these excuses and honestly conduct negotiations. The Sino-American ambassadorial talks should not be delayed for a long time.

### 美国又提出拖延中美会谈的借口

    美国又提出拖延中美会谈的借口
    每当国际紧张局势有进一步和缓的迹象的时候，人们往往就会注意到来自美国的一股逆流，力图在和缓国际紧张局势的道路上制造新的困难。这几乎已经是一条规律了。中美会谈的情况也不是例外。
    中美会谈对第二项议程“双方有所争执的其他实际问题”已经讨论了两个多月了。人们都殷切地期待着会谈将对和缓中美两国之间的紧张局势作出具体的贡献。人们的这种希望是有它的基础的。在两个多月前，中美会谈开始讨论第二项议程的时候，中国方面就提出了“禁运问题”和“准备更高一级的中美谈判问题”，作为第二项议程的两项议题。解除禁运是世界各国人民为开展贸易的一致要求。举行更高一级中美谈判的建议，更是中国为谋求和平解决中美两国之间的争端而不诉诸武力、特别是为和缓和消除台湾地区的紧张局势所作的具体努力。印度“今天报”在十一月十一日的社论中说出了广大世界人民的主张。它欢迎中国在同美国举行的日内瓦谈判中所采取的步骤，它认为美国现在对第二项议程“不能后退”。
    但是，却有迹象说明美国恰恰是在后退着。最近，从美国方面又传出了阻碍中美会谈进展的老调。根据美国合众社十一月九日的报道，华盛顿美国官员声称，在全部美国人被释放以前，美国将不参与任何其他协议。报道还说，美国官员声称，美国很不满意中国释放它所拘留的美国公民的缓慢。
    人们记得，早在九月十四日，当中美会谈应该开始讨论第二项议程的时候，美国官方人员就曾经声称：“在达成协议的关于遣返平民的声明得到履行之前，讨论其他问题未免为时过早。”在这以后，美国方面显然也认识到这种极端不合理的态度是不可能长久维持下去的；因此，中美会谈终于进入了第二项议程的讨论。但是，现在却又重新出现了这种阻碍会谈进展的老调。这就不能不引起人们的警惕。
    当前在中国的美国人中确有十四名是犯法的美国人，他们正在按照中国的法律服刑。其余的守法美侨，同任何其他守法的外侨一样，根本不存在着任何被中国拘留的问题，只要没有未了的事件，他们是一向可以随时离境的。就是对于在中国犯法的美国人，中国也一向采取了宽大的政策，按照他们的罪行和表现，酌情减刑和提前释放。从八月一日中美大使级会谈开始到九月十日中美会谈对第一项议程达成协议的期间，中国就提前释放了十一名犯法的美国人，并且具体通知美方，十二名申请离境的美侨都可以离境。第一项议程达成协议时，中国又具体通知美方，提前释放和遣送出境十名犯法的美国人。在这以后，中国还陆续释放了五名犯法的美国人，并迅速地批准了新近提出离境申请的三名美侨出境。因此，自从中美会谈开始以来，中国已经释放了二十六名犯法的美国人，批准了十五名美侨离境。这就是说，所有在中国的愿意回国的美国人都已经行使了他们的返回的权利；即使对于那些犯法的美国人，自从中美会谈开始以来中国已经释放的人数也占当时全部被拘美犯的三分之二。这就充分地说明了，对于中国方面的所谓“缓慢”的指责完全是无的放矢。
    如果要提出“缓慢”的问题的话，那末，应该受到指责的正是美国方面。在中美会谈的过程中，美方也不能不承认，许多中国留学生和侨民早就申请离境，而长期被美国政府阻止不能离开美国。美方在会谈中也曾经交出了这些人中一部分的名单。当然，这些名单并没有包括所有早已申请回国的中国留学生和侨民。例如，一九五四年九月二日公开向美国总统写信要求准许离境的中国学生就并没有全部被包括在内。但是，就以美方自己所交来的这些名单来说，从八月一日到九月十日，只有一个人离开了美国回到了中国，九月十日协议达成以后，也只有八个人回到了中国，而至今还有三十八人没有回国。自从中美会谈开始一直到现在，仅在美国所承认的早已申请回国的一部分中国留学生和侨民中，已经回国者还不到五分之一。如果考虑到中国在美国的侨民数以万计的事实，那末，从美国回到中国的华侨和留学生的人数在全部愿意回国的在美中国人中所占的比例更是微不足道的。
    而且，双方平民回国问题还决不仅仅是一些比例数字的问题。中美两国侨民回国问题是性质很不相同的两个问题。当前在中国服刑、暂时不能行使回国权利的美国人是违犯了中国法律的美国人。对于他们的罪行，美国方面知道得很清楚。最近被提前释放并遣送出境的一些犯法的美国人也清楚地叙述了他们自己的罪行。显然，犯法的美国人必须按照中国的法律程序被审查处理以后，才有可能行使回国的权利。即使对于这些犯法的美国人，中国也正在尽速地逐个审查他们的案件，确定适当的措施。另一方面，长期被美国政府阻止不能回国的中国人，却是无辜的中国侨民和留学生。他们没有犯任何罪，他们唯一的罪名就是要求回国。既然中美会谈对双方平民回国问题达成了协议，美国政府就应该采取措施，使这些无辜的中国侨民和留学生立即能够回国。美国在这方面没有积极的表现，却毫无根据地提出对中国方面的指责，这不能不被认为是蓄意歪曲事实，颠倒是非，借以拖延和阻挠中美会谈的进展。
    事实是歪曲不了的。人们不能容许美国在中美会谈进展的道路上制造新的困难。如果美国有解决问题的诚意，就应该停止制造这些借口，老老实实地进行谈判。中美大使级会谈是不应该长此拖延下去的。
