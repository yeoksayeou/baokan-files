    Fully Utilizing the Leading and Exemplary Role of Old Cooperatives
　　Introducing Leadership Production Experiences to New Cooperatives Editor：
    Recently, twenty-three new agricultural production cooperatives have been established in Qiaolou Township, Ningling County, Henan Province, and seven old cooperatives have also expanded. The number of farmers joining the cooperatives has already accounted for 82 percent of the total number of farm households in the township. After the establishment of the new cooperatives, they generally felt a lack of experience in collectively leading production. For example, the Hou Li Ji cooperative has been established for more than half a month, but the cultivation area has not yet been demarcated, the production teams have not been organized, and the autumn white land of the whole cooperative has not been plowed. Although the Da Zhuang cooperative has established a production organization, the phenomenon of wasting work time and competing for work points is serious. If these problems are not resolved in time, they will hinder the consolidation of the new cooperatives.
    After discovering these problems, the Qiaolou Township Party Branch of the Communist Party of China immediately organized some old cooperative directors, cultivation team leaders, and experienced party members and members of the Communist Youth League to go to various villages to help the new cooperatives establish production order and introduce cooperative management experience, which achieved good results. For example, the production situation of the newly established Qi Wang Zhuang cooperative was very chaotic, and the cadres were busy all day long, but they could not figure out anything; Li Guangqin, the director of the Li Ji old cooperative, went to the Qi Wang Zhuang cooperative to introduce in detail the methods of division of labor among cadres and arrangement of farm work in the Li Ji cooperative, and also helped them divide the whole cooperative into several production teams, and then the teams contracted the work to the production groups, so that the production of the whole cooperative was on the right track. For example, the Wu Zhuang old cooperative knew that the Wang Lao Jia new cooperative had no experience in formulating production plans, so it sent the director Liu Jinfu and committee member Liu Jinrong to help the Wang Lao Jia cooperative formulate realistic annual production plans according to the needs of the state and the specific situation of the cooperative, and also formulated quarterly plans, monthly plans, and short-term plans for three to five days. In addition, in the process of formulating the plan, they also helped the cadres of the Wang Lao Jia cooperative learn to master production indicators, pay attention to technology promotion, and timely sowing experience. The problems existing in the two new cooperatives, Hou Li Ji and Da Zhuang, have also been resolved with the help of the cadres of the old cooperatives.
    The cadres of the old cooperatives have adopted an enthusiastic attitude towards helping the new cooperatives. Some cadres of the old cooperatives took the initiative to take time out in the evenings to go deep into the new cooperatives to help solve specific problems such as team formation, demarcation of cultivation areas, and scoring. The cadres and members of the new cooperatives also warmly welcomed the help of the old cooperatives. Their common reflection is: This has cured the root cause of our cooperative's disease! Some members of the new cooperatives used to fall asleep when they attended meetings at night, but when the old cooperatives sent people to introduce their experience, they listened attentively.
    With the active help of the old cooperatives, all the new cooperatives in Qiaolou Township are carrying out winter production activities in full swing.　Wang Xuxiu

### 向新建社介绍领导生产的经验

    充分发挥老社的带头示范作用
　　向新建社介绍领导生产的经验编辑同志：
    河南省宁陵县乔娄乡最近新建了二十三个农业生产合作社，七个老社也扩大了，全乡入社农户已经占农户总数的百分之八十二。新社建立以后，普遍感到缺乏领导集体生产的经验。像后李集社建成了半个多月，耕作区还没有划定，生产队还没有编好，全社的秋白地也都没有动犁。大庄社虽然建立了生产组织，但是窝工、争工分的现象严重。这些问题如果不及时解决，就会妨碍新建社的巩固。
    中共乔娄乡党支部发现了这些问题以后，立即组织了一部分老社社长、耕作队长和有生产经验的党员、团员分别到各村帮助新建社建立生产秩序，介绍办社经验，收到了很好的效果。例如，齐王庄新建社生产情况很乱，干部一天忙到晚，也搞不出名堂来；李集老社社长李广勤就到齐王庄社详细地介绍了李集社干部分工、农活安排的方法，又帮助他们把全社分成几个生产队，再由队包活给生产组，这样就使全社生产上了轨道。又如，吴庄老社知道王老家新建社没有订生产计划的经验，就派社长刘金福、委员刘金荣帮助王老家社按照国家需要和社里的具体情况，订出了切合实际的全年生产计划，还订出了季度计划、月计划和三五天的短期计划。此外，还在订计划的过程中，帮助王老家社的干部们学习了掌握生产指标，注意技术推广和适时播种的经验。后李集和大庄两个新建社所存在的问题，在老社干部的帮助下，也都得到了解决。
    老社的干部对帮助新建社的工作都采取了热情的态度，有些老社的干部主动地在晚上抽出空闲时间深入新建社帮助解决编队、划耕作区、评分等具体问题。新建社的干部和社员也热烈地欢迎老社的帮助，他们的共同反映是：这一下可治了咱们社的病根子啦！有些新建社的社员过去晚上开会的时候爱睡觉，但是当老社派人来介绍经验的时候，他们就聚精会神地听着。
    在老社的积极帮助下，乔娄乡所有的新建社都在热火朝天地展开冬季的生产活动。　王叙修
