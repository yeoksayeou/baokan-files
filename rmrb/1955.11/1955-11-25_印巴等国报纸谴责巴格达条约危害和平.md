Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, November 24th: The Indian "Amrita Bazar Patrika" wrote in its editorial on the 22nd: "The Baghdad Pact is a very dangerous trap set by Western countries, and its consequences may endanger the cause of world peace; and Asian and African countries, especially those directly participating in this treaty, will probably suffer the most."

The "Free Press" said in its editorial on the 21st that the "result can only exacerbate the already dangerously tense situation in that region" from the Baghdad Pact participant countries' Prime Ministers' meeting.

The Bengali daily "Ananda Bazar Patrika" wrote in its editorial on the 21st: "The time has definitely come for Asian countries to shout to foreign military blocs: do not interfere in Asia."

According to Xinhua News Agency, the "Pakistan Times" commented on the Pakistani delegation's participation in the Baghdad Pact Permanent Council meeting held in Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, on the 21st. The newspaper quoted a statement made not long ago by a spokesperson for the Pakistani Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The statement said: Pakistan "is willing to undertake more obligations in regions outside its own territory if it can obtain substantial military assistance." The newspaper asked: "What does it mean for Pakistan to undertake more obligations outside its own national borders? Does this mean that in exchange for military assistance, Pakistan will hand over its troops to the command of British and American headquarters for their use in the Middle East?" The newspaper finally pointed out, "It is absolutely necessary to submit all the issues involved in Pakistan's acceptance of important military and diplomatic obligations to the Constituent Assembly for discussion."

　　印巴等国报纸谴责巴格达条约危害和平
    新华社新德里二十四日电　印度“甘露市场报”在二十二日的社论中写道：“巴格达条约是西方国家设下的非常危险的陷阱，其后果可能要危害世界和平事业；而亚非国家，特别是直接参加这个条约的那些国家，大概会受到最大的危害”。
    “自由新闻”二十一日的社论说，巴格达条约参加国总理会议的“结果只能加剧已经紧张到危险程度的那个地区的紧张局势”。
    孟加拉文日报“欢喜市场报”在二十一日的社论中写道：“时间是肯定到来了，亚洲国家要对外国军事集团大呼：不要干涉亚洲”。
    据新华社讯　“巴基斯坦时报”评论巴基斯坦代表团参加巴格达条约常设理事会二十一日在伊拉克首都巴格达举行的会议。这家报纸引用了不久以前巴基斯坦外交部发言人的声明。声明说：巴基斯坦“如果能够获得大量军事援助的话，它愿意在它本土范围以外的地区承担更多的义务”。报纸问道：“巴基斯坦在自己国境范围以外承担更多的义务意味着什么呢？这是不是说，为了换取军事援助，巴基斯坦将把自己的军队交给英国和美国的司令部调遣，供它们在中东使用呢？”报纸最后指出，“应该把巴基斯坦接受重要的军事和外交义务这件事所牵涉到的所有问题提交制宪议会讨论，这是绝对必要的。”
