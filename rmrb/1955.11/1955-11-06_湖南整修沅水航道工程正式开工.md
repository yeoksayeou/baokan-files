    Hunan Officially Starts Repairing the Yuan River Waterway Project
    The project to repair the Yuan River waterway in Hunan Province has officially commenced.
    The Yuan River is approximately one thousand kilometers long, flowing through twenty-six counties and cities including Yuanjiang, Hanshou, Changde, Taoyuan, and Jishou. It serves as the transportation artery of western Hunan Province, handling the primary transport tasks for local specialties, grains, and industrial products from the Xiangxi region. Grains, local specialties, and industrial products from parts of Guizhou and Sichuan provinces also rely on the Yuan River for transportation in and out. With the development of the national economy, the transportation volume borne by the Yuan River has increased year by year. The transport volume was approximately 500,000 tons in 1953, increasing to 1,000,000 tons in 1954, a doubling of the volume. However, the Yuan River has many shoals, rapid currents, hidden reefs, and a winding waterway. On the 290-kilometer stretch of waterway from Changde to Chenxi alone, there are more than thirty major dangerous shoals, which are extremely unfavorable for navigation and seriously affect the transportation of goods. Except during the flood season when steamships can travel, only wooden sailboats can travel throughout the year, but they also need to be transshipped multiple times. Therefore, not only is transportation efficiency low, but transportation costs are high and turnover is slow. Accidents also occur constantly. Since 1953, the backlog of goods in the Yuan River basin has become more serious year by year. At the end of 1954, the backlog of various goods awaiting shipment reached more than 100,000 tons. This year, Guizhou and Sichuan provinces requested Hunan to transport 150,000 tons of grain out through the Yuan River, but due to current transportation conditions, Hunan can only transport 60,000 tons. This year, Hunan, Guizhou, and Sichuan provinces have achieved bumper harvests, and the transportation volume of the Yuan River will greatly increase. If the current wooden sailboats are used for transportation, the backlog of goods will definitely be even more serious. In order to solve the transportation of stockpiled goods and increase transportation volume, the Hunan Provincial Department of Transportation decided this year to repair the 70-kilometer section of waterway before and after Qinglang Shoal to remove hidden reefs and dangerous shoals. The repaired waterway will have a draft of 1.2 meters and maintain the ability to accommodate steamships and shallow-draft steamships for eight months of the year, in order to adapt to the country's increasingly busy transportation tasks.
    The entire Yuan River waterway repair project is expected to be completed within three years. After the repair is completed, shallow-draft steamships can also travel on the waterway during the dry season, and the transportation volume will increase more than four times compared to wooden sailboats, and freight rates can be reduced by 15% to 20%. This will not only greatly reduce transshipment costs but also reduce transportation damage accidents. (Reported by our correspondent stationed in Changsha)

### 湖南整修沅水航道工程正式开工

    湖南整修沅水航道工程正式开工
    湖南整修沅水航道的工程已正式开工。
    沅水全长约一千公里，流经沅江、汉寿、常德、桃源、吉首等二十六个县市，为湖南省西部运输动脉，承担着湘西地区土特产、粮食和工业品的主要运输任务，贵州、四川等省部分地区的粮食、土特产、工业品也靠沅水运出和运入。随着国民经济的发展，沅水担负的运输量逐年增加。一九五三年运量约五十万吨，一九五四年增加到一百万吨，上升了一倍。但沅水滩多水急，暗礁重重，航道曲折，仅常德至辰溪二百九十多公里的航道上，较大的滩险就达三十多处，对航行极为不利，严重影响物资运输；除洪水时期能行轮船外，常年只能行走木帆船，但也需经过多次的提驳，因此，不但运输效率低，而且运输成本高，周转慢。事故也不断发生。从一九五三年开始，沅水流域的物资积压，一年比一年严重。一九五四年底，积压各类待运物资即达十万多吨。今年贵州、四川二省要求湖南由沅水运出粮食十五万吨，限于目前运输条件，湖南只能承运六万吨。今年湖南、贵州、四川获得大丰收，沅水运输量将大大增加，若以现有木帆船来担负运输，物资积压一定更为严重。为解决积压物资的运输、增加运输量，湖南省交通厅今年决定整修清浪滩前后一段七十多公里的航道，以清除暗礁和滩险，能吃水一公尺二寸，保持在一年中的八个月内能通行轮船、浅水轮船，以适应国家日益繁忙的运输任务。
    整个沅水航道的整修工程，预计在三年内完成。整修完成后，航道在枯水季节也可行浅水轮船，运输量将较木帆船增加四倍以上，运价可降低百分之十五到百分之二十，不但可以大大减少提驳费，也可以减少运输海损事故。　（本报驻长沙记者）
