Guizhou Province has established more than 150 animal epidemic prevention stations and organized local joint veterinary clinics in districts and townships as units. These stations and clinics have universally injected livestock with serum preventive injections in different seasons. According to the statistics of each station, from January to September this year, a total of 479,500 cattle, horses, and pigs have been injected, of which ethnic minorities' livestock account for 35.3%. With the assistance of animal epidemic prevention organizations, mass-based livestock protection work has gradually been carried out. The number of sick livestock in the province this year has decreased by about two-thirds compared with last year, and the number of dead livestock has decreased by 27% compared with last year.

In order to deeply carry out animal epidemic prevention work in various places, especially in ethnic minority areas, the province has now trained 100 ethnic minority animal husbandry and veterinary personnel, and organized the training of 15,418 veterinary and animal husbandry personnel who do not leave production.

    贵州省开展兽疫防治工作
    贵州全省已以区、乡为单位设立了兽疫防治站和组织当地兽中医联合诊所共一百五十多处。这些站、所在不同的季节里给家畜普遍注射了血清预防针。据各站的统计，从今年一月至九月已注射的牛、马、猪共四十七万九千五百多头，其中少数民族的家畜占百分之三十五点三。在兽疫防治组织的协助下，群众性的保畜护畜工作逐步开展起来。全省今年得病的家畜比去年减少了三分之二左右，死亡的家畜数比去年减少了百分之二十七。
    为了在各地，特别是少数民族地区深入开展兽疫防治工作，全省现已培养了少数民族的畜牧兽医工作人员一百名，并组织训练了不脱离生产的兽医?畜人员一万五千四百一十八人。
