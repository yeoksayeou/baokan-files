Anshan Iron and Steel should strengthen the capital management of its subordinate mines
He Guiqian, Director of the Anshan Office of the Anshan Branch of the People's Bank of China

Since the Anshan Iron and Steel Company launched the campaign to increase production and practice economy, the supply department has strengthened its control over the procurement of raw materials and the handling of stockpiled materials. This is good. However, some mines affiliated with Anshan Iron and Steel are slow to act. In those places, large amounts of stagnant materials have not yet been processed, and new stockpiles continue to be generated. When we inspected the capital management of the Ganjiangzi Limestone Mine, the Gongchangling Iron Mine, and the Dagushan Iron Mine, we found that these mines occupied more than 2 million yuan of state funds due to the stockpiling of products and raw materials. The six categories of stagnant and stockpiled materials, including steel, rubber, bearings, plumbing, non-ferrous metals, and machinery, account for more than 30 percent of the total balance of these six categories, based on the calculable portion alone.

Among the stagnant and stockpiled materials in these mines, those that have not moved, have not been received, or have not been paid out for many years amount to 580,000 yuan. Some have not been used at all from January to July this year, and many have not been used since 1954. The total value of materials that Dagushan Mine has not used for many years amounts to 64,900 yuan. The total value of mechanical parts that Ganjiangzi Mine has not used throughout the year is more than 215,800 yuan.

The above-mentioned stockpiled materials only refer to materials that have not been used for a long time. The stockpiling of materials that have been received and paid, or not received or rarely paid, is not included. In fact, the stockpiling of materials that have been received and paid, or not received or rarely paid, is also very serious. According to the current usage, some of these things can last for several years to several decades. For example, a type of railway screw stockpiled by the Ganjiangzi Limestone Mine can be used for 184 years; chain files can be used for 20 years.

What is particularly serious is that some materials are being stockpiled in large quantities on the one hand, and purchased in large quantities on the other. The Ganjiangzi Limestone Mine had 890 ball bearings of the 6004 specification at the end of 1954, and only 50 were used in the first half of this year, but recently another 1,099 were purchased. The Dagushan Iron Mine has 20 kinds of materials that have been stockpiled for a long time in the rubber and bearing categories, but it continues to purchase them. This situation also exists in the Gongchangling Iron Mine and other units.

The main reasons for stockpiling and waste are that some financial and supply staff in these units have an incorrect understanding of the campaign to increase production and practice economy. They believe that although there are many stockpiled materials, they are all good things and cannot be bought back if they are sold. Others believe that: anyway, they will be useful sooner or later. If they are sold now, they will be stockpiled elsewhere, and they will have to be bought again when they need them in the future, so it is better not to deal with them! It is precisely because of this idea that they do not actively deal with stockpiled materials. The existence of this phenomenon is also related to the fact that the leaders of some production and technical departments and supply departments do not pay attention to the use of funds. They pay attention to production (which is of course correct), but they do not pay attention to how to use state production funds economically. The production and technical departments have the idea of "not being afraid of having too many materials." If there are too few raw materials, they reach out and ask for them; if there are too many raw materials or they are not suitable, they do not return them. A workshop in the Ganjiangzi Limestone Mine received hundreds of kilograms of grease anti-rust paint, but did not use it and returned it after nearly two years of stockpiling. In many mines, drill bits are buried in the ground without being dug out, and new ones are collected. In order to ensure supply, the supply department is afraid of buying too few materials. Because the financial department does not understand the situation, it generally "gives money when asked" without strict control.

Excessive reserve fund quotas are also a cause of serious material stockpiling and waste. In these mines, the reserve fund quota is 15 percent larger than the actual balance. If a large number of stockpiled stagnant materials are removed from the actual balance, the size of the quota becomes unbelievably large. The auxiliary material quota of the Ganjiangzi Limestone Mine is 1.07 times larger than the actual balance, and the spare parts quota is 1.49 times larger. This phenomenon also exists in the Gongchangling Iron Mine and other units. Excessive reserve fund quotas actually encourage waste.

We believe that the phenomenon of these units stockpiling and wasting state funds should not continue. Anshan Iron and Steel Company should strengthen its leadership over these units in handling stockpiled materials, strictly control procurement expenditures, and improve the management of fund quotas.

### 鞍钢应该加强对所属矿山的资金管理工作

　　鞍钢应该加强对所属矿山的资金管理工作
　　中国人民银行鞍山分行驻鞍钢办事处主任　何贵谦
    鞍山钢铁公司开展增产节约运动以后，供应部门加强了对原材料采购的控制，加强了对积压资材的处理。这是好的。但是，鞍钢所属的某些矿山行动迟缓，在那些地方，大量呆滞物资到现在还没处理，新的积压又继续产生。我们检查甘井子石灰石矿、弓长岭铁矿和大孤山铁矿等单位的资金管理工作的时候，发现这些矿山因为产品和原材料的积压，多占用了国家资金二百多万元。钢铁、橡胶、轴承、水暖、有色金属、机械等六类的呆滞积压物资，仅可计算部分，就占这六类结存总额的百分之三十以上。
    在这些矿山呆滞积压的物资中，长年不动、不收入也不付出的即达五十八万元。有的从今年一月到七月分毫没有动用过，从一九五四年到现在没动用过的也为数不少。大孤山矿常年没动用的材料的总值达六万四千九百元。甘井子矿全年没动用的机械零件的总值达二十一万五千八百多元。
    上面所说的积压物资，只指长期不动用的物资，有进有支、或不进少支的积压物资，还未计算在内。实际上，有进有支、或不进少支的物资积压也很严重，其中有许多东西，根据现在使用的情况来计算，可以够用几年到几十年。例如，甘井子石灰石矿所积压的一种铁道螺丝，能够用一百八十四年；链子锉可以用二十年。
    尤其严重的是：有些物资一方面大量积压，一方面还在大量购买。甘井子石灰石矿有一种六○○四规格的滚珠，一九五四年年末还有八百九十个，今年上半年仅用去五十个，但是前些时候又买了一千零九十九个。大孤山铁矿在橡胶、轴承两类材料中有二十种物资已长期积压，但是又继续进货。这种情况，在弓长岭铁矿等单位也都存在着。
    造成积压浪费的主要原因，是这些单位中某些财务和供应工作人员对于增产节约运动有不正确的认识，他们认为物资积压虽多，但是都是好东西，卖了买不回来。还有的人认为：反正早晚都有用，现在卖了，到别处也是积压，而今后自己用时还得再买，不如不处理为妙！正是由于有这种想法，他们就不积极处理积压物资。这种现象的存在，也跟某些生产技术部门、供应部门的领导人员不重视资金使用有关。他们注意了生产（这当然是对的），但是没有注意怎样来节约地使用国家的生产资金。生产技术部门有“要材料不怕多”的思想。原材料少了，他们就伸手要；原材料多了或不合用，他们就不退回。甘井子石灰石矿有一个工段，领去油脂防锈漆数百公斤，没有用，积压了差不多二年才退回来。在许多矿山中，钎子被埋在地里，不挖出来，而另领新的。供应部门为了保证供应，就怕材料买的少。财务部门由于不了解情况，一般地也总是“要钱就给”，而不加以严格的控制。
    储备资金定额过大也是造成物资严重积压和浪费的一个原因。在这些矿山中，储备资金定额比实际结存大百分之十五。如果把大量积压呆滞物资从实际结存中剔除，其定额之大就达到使人难以置信的地步。甘井子石灰石矿的辅助材料定额要比实际结存大到一点零七倍，零星配件大到一点四九倍。弓长岭铁矿等单位也都有这种现象。储备资金定额过大，实际上起了鼓励浪费的作用。
    我们认为，这些单位积压浪费国家资金的现象，不应该继续下去。鞍山钢铁公司应该加强对这些单位在处理积压物资方面的领导，严格控制采购支出，改善资金的定额管理。
