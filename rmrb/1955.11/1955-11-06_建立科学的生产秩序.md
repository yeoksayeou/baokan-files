Establishing a Scientific Production Order
　　Fan Rongkang
Regular cyclic operation is the advanced experience of grassroots units in Soviet coal mining enterprises in organizing production. In 1954, the one-meter seam coal mining face on East 7th Road of Pit No. 1 of the Ping'an Mine under the Fuxin Mining Bureau, fully learned from this advanced experience and created a set of practical methods, basically realizing regular cyclic operation from beginning to end. They completed the coal mining originally planned for 261 working days in advance by 93 days, with 168 working days, saving more than 13,000 man-days, achieving a production balance rate of 97.3%, increasing labor productivity by 88% compared to the national plan, reducing direct costs by 22.35% compared to the national plan, and completely eliminating fatal and serious injuries, with a significant reduction in minor injuries.

The production record of the one-meter seam coal mining face is the highest record in the national coal mining industry for fully completing the national plan. Its advanced experience in organizing regular cyclic operation has comprehensively improved the production management level of grassroots units in coal mining enterprises, opening up a path to achieving balanced and safe production, ensuring the fulfillment and overfulfillment of the national plan in coal mining enterprises. As Soviet experts pointed out: conscientiously promoting the advanced experience of the one-meter seam coal mining face in organizing regular cyclic operation, so that all coal mining faces in the country can achieve one cycle per day and night like the one-meter seam coal mining face, will be a revolution in the history of China's coal mining.

The history of China's modern coal mining industry is a history of imperialist plunder of our resources. For a long time, high-fall and residual-pillar mining methods have been used in China's coal mines, mainly relying on workers' physical labor to mine coal. The recovery rate of general thick coal seams is only 30%, and thin coal seams are only 60%, meaning that 40% to 70% of the coal is left underground. Furthermore, devastating accidents such as floods, fires, and gas explosions often occur, often resulting in hundreds or thousands of people dying in a single accident. Since the implementation of the new coal mining method in 1950, the face of China's coal mining industry has undergone fundamental changes. The recovery rate of mineral resources has reached over 70%, safety conditions have been greatly improved, and the degree of mechanization has been greatly increased. This is a major reform in the history of China's coal mining, transforming China's coal mining from colonial exploitation methods to socialist exploitation methods.

However, the reform of coal mining methods is, after all, only a revolution in technical work; the production management work of the mine has not been able to keep up. Moreover, with the reform of coal mining methods, the working face has been lengthened, more coal mining machinery has been equipped, the arrangement between processes and the interrelationship between types of work have become more complicated, and roof management has been further elevated to an important position in operations. This makes it even more urgent for the production management work of coal mines to also undergo corresponding reforms. Because for a long time, this new proposition has not been well resolved, the effectiveness of the new coal mining method has been greatly limited. The working time utilization rate of general mines is only about six hours, the equipment utilization rate is generally low, and the problems of unbalanced production and unsafety have not been resolved, and there is a lack of fundamental guarantee for fully completing the national plan. Taking the Ping'an Mine in 1953 as an example, although the output plan was completed, labor efficiency only reached 92.6% of the national plan, and costs exceeded the budget by 10.2%. More seriously, production was unbalanced and accidents were frequent. Although the actual output in December was more than 3,000 tons of coal less than planned, it was already 60.5% more than the actual output in February. The total number of casualties throughout the year increased by a full 100% compared to 1952.

How to improve the production management level of coal mining enterprises, and to comprehensively complete the national plan in a balanced and safe manner, has been the long-term goal of all coal mining enterprises. Taking the Ping'an Mine as an example, a lot of work was done in 1953. The central work for a period included major safety inspections and the implementation of planned management, and the "pilot projects" of various rules and regulations and advanced experiences were frequently carried out. These efforts solved some problems, but neither one central task after another, nor various "pilot projects" fundamentally changed the face of production management at the Ping'an Mine.

What is the reason for this? The reason is that the Ping'an Mine at that time had not fully grasped the laws of coal mining operations and could not establish a set of scientific management methods adapted to these objective laws.

Taking the major safety inspection as an example, accidents are frequent, and strengthening safety work is completely necessary. However, accidents in coal mine production are inseparable from the chaos of the production order, especially unbalanced production, which increases accidents. Conducting major safety inspections in isolation, without fundamentally improving the production order, can certainly prevent some accidents by establishing the idea of safe production and plugging loopholes in safety work. It can also reflect some defects in production management from the perspective of safety work and urge the solution of these problems. However, the strengthening of safety work cannot replace the improvement of all production management work, and therefore cannot prevent the frequent accidents caused by poor production management. This is the reason why, although the major safety inspection of the Ping'an Mine in 1953 widely mobilized the masses, exposed many problems, and established many systems, the result was still an increase in accidents by 100%.

Taking planned management as another example, this is a fundamental issue in enterprise management. It is completely correct to implement planned management. However, coal mine production is not exactly the same as the production of other enterprises. The biggest feature of coal mine production is the continuous struggle against the natural enemies underground. To implement planned management in coal mining enterprises, one cannot simply compile operation plans based on national plans and equipment maintenance plans, but must grasp the changes in underground natural conditions and their influence on coal mining operations, and adopt various effective measures to exclude this influence. Only in this way can the plan be built on a reliable foundation. At that time, the planned management of the Ping'an Mine did not pay enough attention to this aspect, so the plan often failed. The coal mining face on West 9th Road of Pit No. 1 experienced such a situation: it passed a fault, but the technical documents did not indicate that it had arrived, so the workers continued to mine, resulting in a roof collapse accident. Also in this coal mining face, there was an old roadway above, but they did not know it in advance. The squad leader still directed the blasting, and another roof collapse occurred. The summary material of the planned management implemented by the Ping'an Mine in 1953 admitted: "Similar situations exist in more than one pit."

Obviously, to improve the production management level of coal mining enterprises and adapt to the increasingly developing production requirements after the reform of coal mining methods, if one does not grasp the laws of coal mining operations and adapt to these laws, it will be difficult to achieve results by simply strengthening one aspect of work in isolation or simply strengthening production management work in general. The advanced experience of the one-meter seam coal mining face in organizing regular cyclic operation, therefore, can become another major reform in China's coal mining after the reform of coal mining methods. This is because this advanced experience completely meets the laws of coal mining operations, meets the specific conditions of China's coal mines, and can comprehensively manage all aspects of coal mining operations in a strict and scientific manner, ensuring balanced and safe production, and finally ensuring the comprehensive completion of the national plan.

The situation of promoting the advanced experience of the one-meter seam coal mining face in organizing regular cyclic operation in various coal mines over the past year has further proved that promoting this advanced experience is an effective way to improve the production management level of coal mining enterprises. All coal mining faces that have conscientiously promoted this advanced experience have shown an orderly production order, knowing in their hearts when a situation may occur, what needs to be done, and how to do it. In the past, every shift had to waste one or two hours after going down the mine to understand the progress of work and divide the labor. Now this phenomenon no longer occurs, and every worker can know their specific tasks before going down the mine. The chaos of section chiefs and squad leaders has been greatly reduced, and they can focus their main energy on checking work and actively solving problems in production. Production downtime has also been significantly reduced, and equipment efficiency has been greatly improved. The coal cutting machine efficiency of the Ping'an Mine has always been very low, and some machines have even been sleeping underground for eight months of the year. Some workers not only did not welcome them, but also felt that they were in the way. After the one-meter seam coal mining face organized regular cyclic operation, the average monthly coal cutting area of each coal cutting machine exceeded the national plan by 100%. With the establishment and consolidation of the production order, the production balance rate has been greatly improved, and accidents have been significantly reduced.

Promoting the advanced experience of the one-meter seam coal mining face in organizing regular cyclic operation and establishing a scientific production order will inevitably increase production and reduce costs. This has also been repeatedly proven by the experience of various places. The Third Coal Mining Section of the Ping'an Mine has never been able to comprehensively complete the national plan for several years, but since the promotion of the advanced experience of the one-meter seam coal mining face in organizing regular cyclic operation, the situation has changed. From January to August this year, the national plan has been basically overfulfilled and comprehensively completed every month. This coal mining section increased coal production by more than 9,000 tons in eight months, eliminated fatal and serious injuries, and reduced costs by more than 50,000 yuan from January to July. In the first half of this year, most of the coal mining faces of the Benxi Mining Bureau did not complete the national plan. At the end of July, after the Benxi Mining Bureau promoted the advanced experience of the one-meter seam coal mining face in organizing regular cyclic operation in six coal mining faces, this situation was reversed in August.

Promoting the advanced experience of the one-meter seam coal mining face in organizing regular cyclic operation, establishing a scientific production order, and comprehensively completing the national coal production plan is of great significance to ensuring the needs of the development of China's industry and transportation, and appropriately taking care of the needs of people's lives. Most of the mines that began construction in China's First Five-Year Plan will not be fully completed until the Second Five-Year Plan period. Although some small and medium-sized mines are currently under construction, they also require one or two years of time. Therefore, in order to meet the current needs of the national economy, it is mainly necessary to rely on exploiting the potential of existing mines. Promoting the advanced experience of the one-meter seam coal mining face in organizing regular cyclic operation is an effective method to exploit the potential of existing mines. In addition to increasing the consumption of some pit props, gunpowder, detonators and other materials, it does not require the state to spend a penny more in investment, and more coal can be extracted immediately. According to statistics, if all the coal mining faces in the country promote this advanced experience, completing only one more cycle of coal mining operations each month can increase the production of raw coal by more than one million tons throughout the year. Since more coal is produced with the same manpower and equipment, costs are reduced most effectively. Taking only one yuan per ton of coal as the reduction in costs, this money can be used to build two pairs of vertical shafts with an annual output of 700,000 to 800,000 tons of coal.

The superiority of the advanced experience of the one-meter seam coal mining face in organizing regular cyclic operation is unquestionable. All coal mines in the country should conscientiously promote this advanced experience and strive to increase coal production, reduce costs, and comprehensively complete the national plan.

    建立科学的生产秩序
    范荣康
    正规循环作业是苏联煤矿企业基层单位组织生产的先进经验。一九五四年，阜新矿务局平安矿一坑东七路一公尺层采煤场子，全面学习了这个先进经验，创造了一套切实可行的办法，基本上自始至终实现了正规循环作业。他们提前九十三天，以一百六十八个工作日完成了原计划二百六十一个工作日才能采完的煤炭，节省了人工一万三千多个，使生产均衡率达到百分之九十七点三，劳动生产率较国家计划提高了百分之八十八，直接成本较国家计划降低了百分之二十二点三五，并且全部消灭了死亡和重伤事故，碰手碰脚的轻伤事故也显著减少。
    一公尺层采煤场子的生产纪录，是全国煤矿中全面完成国家计划的最高纪录。它组织正规循环作业的先进经验，全面提高了煤矿企业基层单位的生产管理水平，开辟了在煤矿企业中实现均衡生产和安全生产、保证完成和超额完成国家计划的道路。正如苏联专家所指出的：认真推广一公尺层采煤场子组织正规循环作业的先进经验，使全国煤矿所有的采煤场子，都能像一公尺层采煤场子那样实现一昼夜一循环，将是我国煤矿历史上的一次革命。
    我国现代煤矿工业的历史，是一部帝国主义掠夺我国资源的历史。在我国煤矿中长期以来采用着高落式、残柱式的采煤方法，主要依靠工人的体力劳动来采煤，一般厚煤层的回采率只达到百分之三十，薄煤层只有百分之六十，即有百分之四十到七十的煤被丢在地下，并经常发生水灾、火灾和瓦斯爆炸等残酷的事故，常常有成千成百的人在一次事故中死亡。自从一九五零年推行新采煤法以后，我国煤矿工业的面貌已有了根本性的改变，矿产资源的回采率已经达到百分之七十以上，安全情况有了很大的改善，机械化的程度大大提高。这是我国煤矿历史上一次重大的改革，它把我国煤矿从殖民地的开采方法扭转到社会主义的开采方法的道路上来。
    可是，采煤方法的改革，毕竟只是技术工作上的革命，矿井的生产管理工作还没有能跟上去；而且随着采煤方法的改革，工作面延长了，配备了更多的采煤机械，工序间的安排、工种间的相互关系都更复杂了，顶板管理也进一步提到作业的重要位置上来，这就更迫切地要求煤矿的生产管理工作也有相应的改革。由于长期以来，这个新的命题没有很好地解决，新采煤法的效用受到很大的限制，一般矿井的工时利用率只有六小时左右，设备利用率普遍很低，生产不均衡和不安全的问题一直未能解决，全面完成国家计划也就缺少了根本的保证。拿一九五三年的平安矿来看，产量计划虽然完成了，但是劳动效率只达到国家计划的百分之九十二点六，成本却超支了百分之十点二。更严重的是生产不均衡和事故频繁，十二月份的实际产量虽然还比计划少出了三千多吨煤，但是已经较二月份的实际产量多出了百分之六十点五，全年伤亡事故较一九五二年增加了整整一倍。
    如何提高煤矿企业的生产管理水平，均衡地、安全地全面完成国家计划，是各个煤矿企业长期以来奋斗不息的目标。拿平安矿来看，一九五三年就曾做了不少工作，光是被列为一个时期的中心工作的，就有保安大检查、实行计划管理等等，至于各种规章制度和先进经验的“试点”，更是经常进行。这些工作都解决了一些问题，但是不论是一个接着一个的中心工作，不论是各种各样的“试点”，都没有能根本改变平安矿生产管理的面貌。
    这是什么原因呢？原因就在于当时的平安矿还没有完全掌握采煤作业的规律，不能建立一套适应这种客观规律的科学的管理方法。
    拿保安大检查来看，事故频繁，加强保安工作是完全必要的。可是，煤矿生产的事故是和生产秩序的混乱分不开的，特别是生产不均衡，事故就增加。孤立地进行保安大检查，而不从根本上来改善生产秩序，固然可以从树立安全生产的思想，堵塞保安工作的漏洞，来杜绝一部分事故；并且也可以从保安工作的角度来反映生产管理上的某些缺陷，督促这些问题的解决，但是保安工作的加强毕竟不能代替全部生产管理工作的改善，因而不能防范由于生产管理不善而屡屡发生的事故。这就是一九五三年平安矿的保安大检查虽然很广泛地发动了群众，揭发了许多问题，也建立了许多制度，但是结果事故还是增加了一倍的原因。
    再拿计划管理来看，这是企业管理中一个根本性质的问题。实行计划管理是完全正确的。可是，煤矿生产和其他企业的生产不完全一样。煤矿生产的最大特点是不断地和地下的自然界的敌人作斗争。在煤矿企业中实行计划管理，就不能只是根据国家计划和设备检修计划来编制作业计划，而必须掌握地下自然情况的变化和它们影响采煤作业的规律，采用各种有效的措施来排斥这种影响。只有这样，计划才能建筑在可靠的基础上。当时平安矿的计划管理对这方面的注意恰恰是不够的，因而计划常常落空。一坑西九路采煤场子就发生这样的事情：过断层了，技术文件上认为还没有到，工人就继续采下去，结果发生了冒顶事故。也就是这个采煤场子，上面有老巷，事先却不知道，班长照样指挥放炮，又冒了顶。一九五三年平安矿实行计划管理的总结材料里承认：“类似的情况不只一个坑口有。”
    显然，要提高煤矿企业的生产管理水平，适应采煤方法改革之后日益发展的生产上的要求，如果不掌握采煤作业的规律，不适应这种规律，仅仅孤立地加强一方面的工作，或者只是一般地来加强生产管理工作，都是难以收效的。一公尺层采煤场子组织正规循环作业的先进经验，所以能成为我国煤矿继采煤方法改革之后又一次重大的改革，就在于这个先进经验完全切合采煤作业的规律，切合我国煤矿的具体情况，能够全面地把采煤作业的各个环节用科学的方法严格地管理起来，保证均衡生产和安全生产，最后保证全面完成国家计划。
    一年来，各地煤矿推广一公尺层采煤场子组织正规循环作业的先进经验的情况，更证明了推广这个先进经验是提高煤矿企业生产管理水平的有效途径。凡是认真推广了这个先进经验的采煤场子都出现了有条不紊的生产秩序，什么时候可能发生什么情况，要做些什么事情，怎么做，都能心中有数。从前每个班下井后总要因为现了解工作进度、现分工而窝工一、两个小时。现在这种现象不再发生了，每一个工人都能在下井前知道自己的具体任务。段长和班长的忙乱现象大大减少，他们可以把主要精力用于检查工作和主动地解决生产中的问题。生产的间隙时间也显著减少，设备效率大大提高。平安矿的截煤机效率一直很低，有的甚至一年中有八个月的时间在井下睡觉，部分工人不但不欢迎它，还嫌它碍事；一公尺层采煤场子组织正规循环作业之后，每台截煤机每月的平均截煤面积就较国家计划超过一倍。随着生产秩序的建立和巩固，生产均衡率大大提高，事故也显著减少。
    推广一公尺层采煤场子组织正规循环作业的先进经验，建立科学的生产秩序，最后必然能增加生产，降低成本。这也是被各地的经验一再证明了的。平安矿第三采煤段几年来从来不能全面完成国家计划，但是自从推广一公尺层采煤场子组织正规循环作业的先进经验以后，情况就变了，今年一至八月，基本上月月超额、全面完成国家计划。这个采煤段八个月内增产煤炭九千多吨，消灭了死亡和重伤事故，一至七月降低成本五万多元。今年上半年，本溪矿务局多数采煤场子都没有完成国家计划，七月末本溪矿务局在六个采煤场子推行一公尺层采煤场子组织正规循环作业的先进经验以后，八月份就扭转了这个情况。
    推广一公尺层采煤场子组织正规循环作业的先进经验，建立科学的生产秩序，全面完成国家的煤炭生产计划，对保证我国工业和运输业的发展的需要，和适当地照顾人民生活的需要，是有重大意义的。我国第一个五年计划中开始建设的矿井，大部分要到第二个五年计划期间才能全部建成；目前虽然正在建设一些小型的和中型的矿井，但是也需要一、两年的时间。因此，为了满足当前国民经济的需要，主要地就需依靠发掘现有矿井的潜在力量；而推广一公尺层采煤场子组织正规循环作业的先进经验，正是发掘现有矿井潜在力量的有效方法。除了增加一些坑木、火药、雷管等材料消耗外，它不需国家多花一元钱的投资，就可以马上拿出更多的煤来。据统计，如果全国的采煤场子都推广这个先进经验，每月仅多完成一个采煤作业的循环，全年就可以增产原煤一百多万吨；由于用同样的人力和设备生产了更多的煤，就最有效地降低了成本，仅以每吨煤降低成本一元计算，这笔钱就可以拿来建设两对年产七、八十万吨煤的竖井。
    一公尺层采煤场子组织正规循环作业的先进经验的优越性是无可置疑的，全国煤矿都应该认真推广这个先进经验，为增产煤炭、降低成本，全面完成国家计划而奋斗。
