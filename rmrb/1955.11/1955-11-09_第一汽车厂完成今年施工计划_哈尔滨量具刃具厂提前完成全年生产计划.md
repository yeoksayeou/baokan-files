Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, November 7th. The workers of the Engineering Corporation directly under the Ministry of Building Construction and the First Sanitary Technology Installation Company, who were undertaking the construction of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, completed the 1955 annual construction plan on November 5th.

This great achievement was obtained by all the workers of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant under the direct guidance and specific help of Soviet experts. With the help of Soviet experts, the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant had gained certain construction management experience in the past two years of plant construction. This year, Soviet experts, in view of the characteristics of civil engineering and installation engineering entering cross-construction, helped the construction units to fully prepare for various construction tasks in advance, strengthened economic activity analysis and promoted the team economic accounting system, as well as other advanced experiences and technologies. The construction unit and the construction unit established a general headquarters and a joint office, which powerfully directed the orderly construction of various cross-projects. Therefore, since the beginning of this year, the state's basic construction tasks have been overfulfilled for three consecutive quarters. Especially in August, September and October, there has been a situation of balanced over-fulfillment of the construction plan on a ten-day and monthly basis, which has never occurred since the construction of the plant.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, November 7th. The state-owned Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory completed the annual state production plan on November 5th. Now, the factory's employees are enthusiastically launching a labor competition to overfulfill the annual production increase and savings task before the end of the year.

Since the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory officially started full production in January this year, with the specific help of Soviet experts, by the end of September, it had successfully trial-produced 232 new products, and the product specifications had also expanded to more than 600 types. In the past ten months, the factory's product output has increased by an average of 15 percent month by month, and the product quality has also improved month by month.

This factory is a new factory with heavy tasks of trial-producing new products, and the state allows it to have a certain amount of losses. However, due to the fact that the workers have completed the task of mastering the new production plan ahead of schedule and launched labor competition activities such as breaking through work quotas and saving steel and fuel, not only has the phenomenon of losses been avoided, but also more than one million yuan of wealth can be created for the country.

    第一汽车厂完成今年施工计划
    哈尔滨量具刃具厂提前完成全年生产计划
    新华社长春七日电　承建第一汽车制造厂的建筑工程部直属工程公司和第一卫生技术安装公司职工，已在十一月五日完成了一九五五年的全年施工计划。
    这个巨大的成就是建设第一汽车制造厂全体职工，在苏联专家直接指导和具体帮助下取得的。在苏联专家帮助下，第一汽车制造厂在过去两年建厂中已取得了一定的施工管理经验。今年苏联专家又针对土木建筑工程和安装工程进入交叉施工的特点，帮助施工单位预先充分作好各项施工准备工作，在施工中加强了经济活动分析和推行了班组经济核算制，以及其他先进经验和先进技术。建设单位和施工单位成立了总指挥部和联合办公室，有力地指挥着各项交叉工程有条不紊地施工。因此，今年以来连续三个季度都超额完成了国家基本建设任务，特别是八、九、十三个月中，出现了建厂以来没有过的旬旬月月均衡地超额完成施工计划的局面。
    新华社哈尔滨七日电　国营哈尔滨量具刃具厂已在十一月五日完成了全年国家生产计划。现在，这个工厂的职工正热烈地展开劳动竞赛，准备在年底前，超额完成全年增产节约任务。
    哈尔滨量具刃具厂自今年一月正式全面投入生产以来，在苏联专家具体帮助下，到九月底，就试制成功了二百三十二种新产品，产品规格也扩大到六百多种。十个月来，这个工厂产品产量逐月平均上升百分之十五，产品质量也月月提高。
    这个工厂是一个新厂，新产品试制任务繁重，国家允许它有一定的亏损额。但由于职工们提前完成了掌握新生产计划，并展开突破工时定额、节约钢材和油料等劳动竞赛活动，不但避免了亏损现象，而且能给国家多创造一百多万元财富。
