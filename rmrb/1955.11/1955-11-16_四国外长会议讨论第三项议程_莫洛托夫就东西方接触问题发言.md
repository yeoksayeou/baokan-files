Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, November 15th: The four foreign ministers held a meeting on the 14th to discuss the third item on the agenda - the issue of developing contacts between East and West. The meeting was chaired by Pinay.

　　The first to speak at the meeting was Macmillan. He said that he was disappointed after reading the report of the committee of experts set up according to the instructions of the four heads of government to study this issue, because during the committee's discussions on this issue, a great distance was found between the views of the Soviet representatives and the Western representatives. Macmillan insisted on placing the responsibility for the failure of the expert committee's work to achieve positive results on the Soviet representatives in the committee.

　　He said that the Soviet government believes that it is necessary to eliminate controls on trade in strategic materials, which was not mentioned in the instructions of the four heads of government. Britain does not agree to negotiate on this point.

　　Macmillan particularly emphasized the Western Three's proposals on eliminating interference with radio broadcasts, censorship systems, ruble exchange rates, and the exchange of various delegations.

　　He concluded by saying that the third item on the agenda is in some sense related to the first two items. Some progress on the third item will benefit the achievement of the first and second items. Therefore, he expressed his sincere regret that the experts failed to obtain positive results after a long and careful discussion on the issue of developing contacts.

　　Molotov then spoke.

　　Molotov said that in accordance with the instructions of the four heads of government, we should first of all pay attention to gradually eliminating obstacles to the free exchange of people and peaceful trade between countries, and the Soviet delegation's proposals were made on this basis.

　　Molotov pointed out that the drafts proposed by the three foreign ministers used the excuse of "strategic trade" considerations to put the elimination of discrimination and obstacles to international trade by Western countries against the Soviet Union and some other countries in last place, while the four heads of government did not mention a single word about "strategic trade." Molotov further pointed out: Recognizing the necessity of eliminating obstacles on the road to developing international trade is of positive significance to both Eastern and Western countries. The Three's proposal simply did not mention this point.

　　Molotov said: Only by making the necessary clarifications on the issue of developing economic ties between countries and ensuring truly unimpeded trade can it be in line with the interests of further easing international tensions and in line with the instructions of the four heads of government.

　　Molotov pointed out that the Soviet delegation's proposals also took into account the instructions of the four heads of government on achieving freer contacts and connections that are mutually beneficial to the countries and peoples concerned, while the Three's draft did not reflect these instructions, and some of the Three's draft's proposals were attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. Molotov said: Our starting point should be: none of us can attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of any country. The Soviet delegation cannot consider these demands in the Three's draft and believes that such demands are inappropriate.

　　Molotov refuted the claim that the Soviet leaders were trying to isolate their people from the outside world and exposed the truth about the so-called "freedom" of Western countries. He said that the Soviet Union does not allow the "freedom" to propagate war or the "freedom" to carry out sabotage activities against the Soviet Union, because this is not in line with the interests of peace and the development of friendship and cooperation between countries.

　　Molotov said: In the process of experts discussing the Soviet delegation's proposals and the Western countries' proposals, the views of all delegations have become clear, and it seems that there is a general consensus on many issues. However, due to disagreements on certain major items, the experts were unable to make a unanimously agreed decision.

　　When talking about how to formulate a resolution on the development of East-West contacts at the meeting, Molotov said that our task is: this meeting should reach an agreement on certain basic instructions that help to develop contacts. We propose that the draft put forward by the Soviet delegation on the issue of developing contacts between East and West be accepted as the basis. The Soviet delegation also believes that the draft proposal put forward by French Prime Minister Faure at the heads of government meeting on July 22 can also be accepted as the basis. In this nine-point draft of the French delegation, most of the wishes can be reflected in our final resolution. In addition, we can also include some clauses from the Three's draft proposed at this meeting as supplements to our agreement on this issue.

　　The Soviet delegation believes that the adoption of this resolution will be an important step on the road to developing contacts between East and West. With the practical development of this kind of contact, we will move forward. If necessary, we will formulate our future joint instructions.

　　Dulles said in his speech that the results of the meeting's work on the issue of developing contacts were disappointing. Dulles believed that the so-called comprehensive censorship of news and broadcasting by the Soviet side and the consistent interference with other countries' broadcasts hindered the exchange of information and ideas. Like Macmillan, Dulles also emphasized those points in the Three's delegation's proposals, although he admitted that these were internal affairs issues. He insisted that the development of contacts depended on the solution of these problems.

　　Regarding the issue of measures to expand peaceful trade, Dulles said that the discussions in the expert committee did not lay the foundation for reaching an agreement. According to Dulles, this was because the Soviet Union was essentially opposed to expanding East-West trade.

　　When talking about the restrictions on the trade of so-called strategic materials implemented by the United States and other Western countries, Dulles said that this was an incidental issue and had nothing to do with the third item on the agenda.

　　Dulles said that the Foreign Ministers Conference has done little to eliminate the obstacles to the development of East-West contacts, but if we face the facts now, the future will be clearer. Since the heads of government meeting in July, some achievements have been made, and some obstacles have indeed been eliminated. The United States is unwilling to stop the work aimed at establishing freer contacts.

　　Finally, Dulles expressed the hope that although the talks conducted at the meeting did not lead to important agreements, they would help find ways to establish lasting peace in the future.

　　Pinay said that France fervently hopes to restore spiritual ties with the people of Eastern Europe, especially Russia, which have been maintained for several centuries. After expressing his satisfaction that the experts from both sides have expressed their willingness to expand the exchange of scientists, the exchange of cultural materials, and the expansion of travel, Pinay said that the summary of the experts' work is disappointing, because the representatives of the Western countries in the expert committee were unable to persuade the Soviet representatives to agree to study certain important issues. According to Pinay, these issues are censorship, wider permission for reporters to interview news, cancellation of interference with radio broadcasts, and elimination of restrictions on the French diplomatic missions in the Soviet Union.

　　When talking about the development of transportation links and trade, which are more important for the development of East-West contacts, Pinay insisted that the so-called strategic material controls implemented by Western countries have only a secondary impact on trade, but are necessary for the security of Western countries.

　　Pinay expressed agreement with Molotov's statement that the task of the meeting is to reach an agreement on certain basic instructions that can promote the development of contacts, and he submitted a four-nation draft statement on the issue of developing East-West contacts for discussion at the meeting.

　　This draft statement proposes: creating conditions conducive to the development of peaceful trade, gradually eliminating obstacles to the free exchange of ideas and information, and overcoming various difficulties that hinder people's freedom of movement. To this end, the draft proposes to increase and expand cultural exchanges, scientific and technological exchanges, exchange of students, mutual visits by athletes, and development of group and individual travel between East and West.

　　After the principles of developing relations between East and West in these areas are accepted, each of the governments of the Soviet Union and the three Western countries can determine the methods of these exchanges through bilateral agreements on each occasion.

　　The draft specifically suggests that the Soviet Union and the three Western countries should open reading rooms in each other's capitals, freely disseminate official gazettes published by embassies of various countries, abolish restrictions on diplomatic missions, allow news reporters to interview news without censorship, protect industrial and commercial property, facilitate the visits and residence of trade representatives, disseminate statistical materials and trade information more widely, improve the commercial transport insurance system, and establish direct air links between the Soviet Union and Western countries in the near future, and so on.

　　Macmillan said he would study the French proposal.

　　Molotov then spoke. He said that the Soviet delegation is striving to make our decisions in line with the instructions of the heads of government. However, there is a huge difference between the proposals put forward by French Prime Minister Faure at the heads of government meeting and the proposals put forward by the three Western governments at our meeting this time. Molotov pointed out that at the heads of government meeting, no party attempted to interfere in the internal affairs, legislative actions, or administrative orders of one country or another, but now some people are making this attempt.

　　Molotov said that the Soviet Union, in the spirit of easing international tensions and consolidating peace, is constantly developing relations with other countries. In doing so, the Soviet Union stands on the position of defending the rights and interests of its people and developing friendly relations with the people of other countries in order to ease international tensions. People can have no doubt that this policy is consistent. It is in the interests of the Soviet people and does not violate the interests of other countries' peoples in the slightest, nor does it hinder the development of friendly relations between the Soviet Union and other countries. If no one attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of the Soviet state, then we can solve the practical problems we face extremely easily and to everyone's satisfaction.

　　Molotov said that he would thoroughly study Pinay's proposal and would express the Soviet delegation's opinion on this issue on the 15th.

　　Dulles said that the US delegation will study the French delegation's proposal carefully.

　　The ministers will hold their next meeting on the morning of November 15 to discuss the third item on the agenda.

　　四国外长会议讨论第三项议程
　　莫洛托夫就东西方接触问题发言
    新华社十五日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦十五日讯：四国外交部长十四日会议讨论了第三项议程——关于发展东西方之间的接触的问题。会议由比内担任主席。
    会议上首先发言的是麦克米伦。他说，他在阅读了根据四国外交部长指示成立的专门研究这个问题的专家委员会的工作报告以后感到失望，因为在委员会讨论这个问题的过程中发现苏联代表和西方代表之间的观点有着很大的距离。麦克米伦硬把专家委员会的工作未能取得积极成果的责任推在委员会中的苏联代表的身上。
    他说，苏联政府认为必须消除对战略物资的贸易的管制，这一点是四国政府首脑指示中没有提到的。英国不同意就这一点进行谈判。
    麦克米伦特别着重指出西方三国建议中关于消除对无线电广播的干扰、新闻检查制度、卢布汇率以及互派各种代表团的问题。
    他最后说，第三项议程在某种意义上是同前两项议程有联系的。在第三项议程上面的某种进展将会给第一、二项议程的获得成就带来好处。因此，他对专家们在长期和仔细地讨论了关于发展接触的问题后未能得到积极结果感到真正的遗憾。
    随后是莫洛托夫发言。
    莫洛托夫说，本着四国政府首脑的指示，我们首先应该注意到逐步消除妨碍各国人民之间自由往来和和平贸易的障碍，苏联代表团的建议就是根据这一点作出的。
    莫洛托夫指出，三国外交部长提出的草案借口“战略贸易”的考虑，把消除西方国家对苏联和其他一些国家的贸易的歧视和国际贸易的障碍推到末位，而四国政府首脑对“战略贸易”是一个字也没有提到的。莫洛托夫又指出：承认消除发展国际贸易道路上的障碍的必要性，对东西方国家都有积极意义。而三国建议恰恰就没有提这一点。
    莫洛托夫说：只有对发展国与国之间的经济联系的问题作必要的澄清和保证真正的毫无阻碍的贸易，才符合进一步缓和国际紧张局势的利益，才符合四国政府首脑的指示。
    莫洛托夫指出，苏联代表团的建议也考虑到四国政府首脑关于实现对有关国家和人民互相有利的更自由的接触和联系问题的指示，而三国草案并没有反映这些指示，三国草案有些建议是企图干涉其他国家的内政。莫洛托夫说：我们的出发点应当是：我们中间谁也不可以企图干涉任何国家的内政，苏联代表团不能考虑三国草案中的这些要求，并且认为这种要求是不适当的。
    莫洛托夫驳斥了所谓苏联领导人企图把本国人民同外界隔离开来的说法，并且揭露了西方国家所谓“自由”的真相。他说，苏联不允许宣传战争的“自由”以及对苏联进行破坏活动的“自由”，因为这是不符合和平的利益，不符合发展各国友谊和合作的利益的。
    莫洛托夫说：在专家们讨论苏联代表团的建议和西方国家的建议的过程中，所有代表团的观点已经清楚了，看来，在许多问题上有了大体上一致的看法。但是，由于在某些主要的项目有分歧意见，专家们不能够作出一致同意的决定。
    莫洛托夫在谈到如何制定会议发展东西方之间的接触的决议时说，我们的任务在于：这一会议就某些有助于发展接触的基本指示达成协议。我们建议接受苏联代表团就发展东西方之间接触问题提出的草案作为基础。苏联代表团还认为，也可以接受法国总理富尔七月二十二日在政府首脑会议上提出的建议草案作为基础，在法国代表团这个九点草案中，大部分愿望可以在我们的最后决议中得到反映。此外，我们还可以把在本会议上所提出的三国草案中的某些条款补充列入我们就这一问题作出的协议中。
    苏联代表团认为，通过这一决议，将是在发展东西方之间接触的道路上的一个重要步骤。随着这种接触的实际发展，我们将向前迈进。如果需要的话，我们再拟定我们今后的共同指示。
    杜勒斯在发言中说，会议对发展接触问题所做的工作的结果是令人失望的。杜勒斯认为所谓苏联方面对新闻和广播的全面检查以及一贯地干扰其他国家的广播使情报和思想的交流受到阻碍。像麦克米伦一样，杜勒斯也强调三国代表团建议中的那些要点，虽然他承认这些都是属于内政问题。他硬说接触的发展有赖于这些问题的解决。
    杜勒斯谈到关于扩大和平贸易方面的措施的问题说，专家委员会里的讨论并没有为达成协议奠定基础，据杜勒斯认为，这是由于苏联在实质上反对扩大东西方贸易。
    杜勒斯在谈到美国和其他西方国家执行的对所谓战略物资贸易的限制的时候说，这是一个附带的问题，同第三项议程无关。
    杜勒斯说，外交部长会议在消除发展东西方接触的障碍方面所做的工作很少，但是，如果我们现在就正视事实，那末未来就会比较明朗起来。自从政府首脑七月会议以来，已经取得了某些成就，某些障碍确实也消除了。美国不愿意停止旨在建立更自由的接触的工作。
    最后，杜勒斯表示希望，会议所进行的会谈虽然没有导致重要的协议，但是会有助于在未来找到建立持久和平的途径。
    比内发言说，法国热烈希望恢复同东欧各国人民、特别是保持了已经有好几个世纪的同俄国的精神上的联系。比内对双方专家们已表示准备扩大科学家的来往，扩大文化材料的交换以及扩大旅行表示满意以后说，但是，专家的工作总结是令人失望的，因为专家委员会中的西方国家代表没有能使苏联代表同意去研究某些重要问题。照比内说，这些问题就是新闻检查、更广泛地允许记者采访消息、取消对无线电广播的干扰、消除对法国驻苏联的外交代表机构的限制等问题。
    比内在谈到对发展东西方接触更为重要的发展运输联系和贸易问题的时候却硬说，西方国家实行的所谓战略物资管制。对贸易只有次要的影响，而对于西方国家的安全却是必需的。
    比内表示同意莫洛托夫所说的会议的任务是在于就能促进发展接触的某些基本指示达成协议，他并且把一个四国关于发展东西方之间接触问题的声明草案提交会议讨论。
    这个声明草案建议：创造有利于发展和平贸易的条件，逐步消除在自由交换思想和消息方面的障碍，克服阻碍人们自由行动的种种困难。为此，草案建议东西方之间增进和扩大文化交流和科学和技术交流，互派留学生，运动员互相访问并且发展团体和个人的旅行。
    在这些方面发展东西方之间的关系的原则被接受以后，苏联政府和三个西方国家政府的每一个政府就可以在每一个场合通过双边协定来确定这些交流的方法。
    草案特别具体地建议苏联和三个西方国家互相在各国首都开办阅览室，自由传布各国大使馆出版的官方公报；取消对外交使团的限制；新闻记者采访消息不受检查；保护工商业财产；对贸易代表的访问和居留互相给予方便；更广泛地公布统计材料和贸易性质的情报；改善商运保险制度；苏联和西方国家之间在最近的将来建立直接的航空联系，等等。
    麦克米伦表示他将研究法国的建议。
    莫洛托夫接着发言。他说，苏联代表团竭力要使我们的决定符合政府首脑的指示。然而，法国总理富尔在政府首脑会议上提出的建议同三个西方国家政府在我们这次会议上提出的建议之间却有巨大的不同。莫洛托夫指出，在政府首脑会议上，任何方面都没有企图干涉这一个或那一个国家的内政、立法行动或行政命令，然而现在却有人正在作这种尝试。
    莫洛托夫说，苏联本着缓和国际紧张局势和巩固和平的愿望，不断发展同其他国家的关系。苏联在这样作时是站在捍卫本国人民的权利和利益以及为了缓和国际紧张局势而发展同其他国家的人民的友好关系的立场上。人们可以不必怀疑，这一政策是始终不变的。它符合苏联人民的利益，并且一点也不违背其他各国人民的利益，不阻碍苏联和其他国家的友好关系的发展。如果没有人企图干涉苏维埃国家的内政，那么我们就能够极其容易地解决我们面临的实际问题，使大家感到满意。
    莫洛托夫表示将对比内的建议加以彻底研究，并且将在十五日表示苏联代表团对这个问题的意见。
    杜勒斯说，美国代表团将很好地研究法国代表团的建议。
    部长们将在十一月十五日上午举行下一次会议，讨论第三项议程。
