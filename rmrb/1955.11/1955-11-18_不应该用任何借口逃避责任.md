No Excuses Should Be Used to Evade Responsibility
Lu Hao

There are only forty-odd days left in 1955.

According to investigation materials from seventy-one factories in Shenyang: From January to September, based on the state-stipulated six indicators for inspection, only twenty-three factories comprehensively fulfilled the state plan; thirty-nine factories partially fulfilled the state plan; and nine factories did not fulfill any of the indicators. Therefore, seizing the time and striving to comprehensively fulfill the state plan has become a very pressing task for many factories and relevant Party organizations at all levels.

However, some people are finding various excuses to evade tasks. Some factory leaders say: The main reason why we have not comprehensively fulfilled the state plan is due to objective difficulties. Indeed, some factories have objective difficulties, but the main reason why the vast majority of factories have failed to comprehensively fulfill the state plan is that the factory leadership work has shortcomings. As long as the factory leaders can face up to their shortcomings and actively improve their work, difficulties can be completely overcome. In the first half of the year, Shenyang Smelting Plant failed to complete four indicators of the state plan, and the cost overrun reached 1.2 million yuan; however, the leaders of the smelting plant faced up to their shortcomings, redeployed their work, and in July and August not only comprehensively completed the state plan, but also made up 90 percent of the profit shortfall turned over to the state in the first half of the year. The production situation in September was even better than in the previous two months. Those who emphasize objective difficulties and believe that their work has been done very well are simply trying to shirk responsibility in the face of a serious battle.

Some factory leaders say: The key problem is that the plan is too high, so it is impossible to complete the task; if the plan cannot be reduced, they request that part of the plan be "adjusted" to other factories. Of course, if the plan is indeed unrealistic, it is permissible to request that the leading organs make appropriate adjustments. However, the plans of many factories are not too high, some are even too low. For example, the Shenyang Bicycle Factory has larger equipment capacity than the Tianjin Bicycle Factory and the Shanghai Bicycle Factory, but its planned output is lower than these two factories. Compared with last year, the factory's expansion project has been completed this year, and the equipment capacity is even larger than last year, but the planned output is only a little more than 3 percent higher than last year. How can it be said that such a plan is too high? The leaders of this factory still demand a 23 percent reduction in the plan! The fact is that these leaders are afraid of losing face if they fail to complete the plan, so they want to reduce or "adjust" the plan. They have forgotten that using the achievements of other factories to make up for their own shortcomings is equally disgraceful.

There are also some leaders of factories with very poor plan completion who say without confidence: We certainly cannot comprehensively fulfill the state plan this year anyway, let's talk about it next year. Is there really no way? No. For example, in the first three quarters of this year, the Shenyang Low-Voltage Switch Factory did not complete any of the six indicators stipulated by the state. In the fourth quarter, it improved labor organization and implemented assembly line operations, and the current situation has improved. In October, the factory's commodity output value exceeded the original plan by 39 percent. Next year's work is based on this year's progress. Without the determination to transform one's own factory from its current backward situation, the result will be that this year's state plan will fail, and next year's situation will not be good either.

There is very little time left in 1955. The leaders in every factory should face up to their shortcomings, mobilize the strength of all employees, and make a final effort to ensure the comprehensive completion and overfulfillment of this year's state plan.

    不应该用任何借口逃避责任
    陆灏
    一九五五年只剩下四十几天的时间了。
    根据沈阳七十一个工厂的调查材料：从一月份到九月份，按照国家规定的六项指标检查，全面完成国家计划的只有二十三个工厂；部分完成国家计划的有三十九个工厂；一项指标也没有完成的有九个工厂。因此，抓紧时间，争取全面完成国家计划，就成为很多工厂及有关各级党组织当前一个十分迫切的任务。
    可是，有些人却找各种借口逃避任务。有的工厂领导者说：我们之所以没有全面地完成国家计划，主要是因为客观困难。的确，有一些工厂有客观困难，但是绝大多数的工厂之所以未能全面地完成国家计划，主要还是工厂领导工作有缺点，只要工厂的领导者能够正视自己的缺点，积极改进工作，困难是完全可以克服的。沈阳冶炼厂在上半年有四项指标没有完成国家计划，成本超支达一百二十万元；但是冶炼厂的领导者正视了自己的缺点，重新部署了工作，七、八月份不仅全面完成了国家计划，而且补足了上半年上缴利润差额的百分之九十，九月份的生产情况又比前两个月前进了一步。那些强调客观困难，认为自己的工作已做得很好了的人，只是企图在严重的战斗面前推卸责任。
    有的工厂领导人员说：关键问题是计划太高了，因此无法完成任务；如果计划不能削减，就要求把部分计划“调整”给别的工厂。当然，如果计划的确不切实际，要求领导机关加以适当的调整，也是可以的。但是，许多工厂的计划并不是过高，有的甚至是太低。例如沈阳自行车制造厂，设备能力比天津自行车制造厂、上海自行车制造厂都大，计划产量却比这两个厂低。跟去年比，这个厂今年的扩建工程已经完成了，设备能力比去年更大了，但是计划产量只比去年增加百分之三多一点。怎能说这样的计划过高呢？这个厂的领导人员仍然要求削减计划百分之二十三！事实上是这些领导人员怕完不成计划不体面，才要削减或“调整”计划。他们忘记了：用别的厂的成绩来弥补自己的缺点，同样是不体面的。
    还有一些计划完成得很不好的工厂的领导人员没有信心地说：我们今年反正是不能全面完成国家计划了，到明年再说吧。真的没办法了吗？不是的。如沈阳低压开关厂在今年前三个季度，国家所规定的六项指标，一项也没有完成。第四季度改进了劳动组织，实行流水作业法，目前情况已有好转。十月份，全厂的商品产值就超过了原计划百分之三十九。明年的工作是在今年的基础上前进的，没有决心把自己的工厂从目前落后的情况下转变过来，其结果是今年的国家计划落空，明年的光景也不会好。
    一九五五年只剩下很短的时间了。每一个工厂中的领导人员都应当正视自己的缺点，动员全体职工的力量，为了保证全面完成和超额完成今年的国家计划作最后的努力。
