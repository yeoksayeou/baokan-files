Textbooks are an important tool for our country to carry out communist education for the next generation. The content of textbooks must be correct; to express correct content, correct language must be used. Those who teach rely on the language written in the textbooks to convey correct thoughts and various scientific knowledge; those who learn rely on the language written in the textbooks to understand correct thoughts and acquire various scientific knowledge. If the language in textbooks is not standardized and cannot enable people to gain a common and correct understanding, then the task of the textbooks cannot be completed. Soviet education scientist, Academician Kairov, quoted a sentence in his book "Pedagogy" when discussing textbooks: "Every word and every definition in a textbook should be carefully considered."

Our country is a united and unified country. Textbooks, as an important educational tool, must also be unified nationwide, and educational work must be carried out within the national scope by relying on unified teaching materials, in accordance with the country's educational guidelines and policies. Therefore, the language written in textbooks must be a unified and common language, and should not be, and cannot be, those regional dialects with extremely narrow application ranges. --The language referred to here refers to the language of the Han nationality. Some other ethnic groups use their own languages to compile textbooks, while others use textbooks written in Chinese as the basis for translation or adaptation.

Correct language, standardized language, and the common language of the whole people are necessary requirements for compiling textbooks.

The common language of the Han nationality has gradually formed for a long time; however, the requirement for the standardization of Chinese has never been put forward as urgently as it is today, and the relevant standardization issues have not been clearly resolved. The differences in spoken Chinese dialects and some confusion in written Chinese have brought many difficulties to textbook compilation.

Due to the lack of clarity in the standardization of modern Chinese, and the lack of standards to follow for the language used in compiling textbooks, some of the confusion in written language is inevitably reflected in the textbooks. Some textbooks sometimes still use some non-modern, old-fashioned classical Chinese vocabulary and grammar, and some textbooks select translations that use some non-Chinese, awkward foreign language components. Many students have reported that such textbooks do not easily lead to clear and accurate understanding; many teachers have reported that using such textbooks for teaching sometimes requires some effort to explain the language. This situation directly damages the quality of education work to a considerable extent.

The lack of clear standards for Chinese has a greater impact on elementary school Chinese language textbooks. Elementary school Chinese language textbooks are used to teach children to learn the language. What language to use to teach children, what are the basic rules of the phonetics, vocabulary, and grammar of this language, what counts as a standard example, and what counts as an error that violates the standards: these questions are all prerequisites for compiling elementary school Chinese language textbooks.

Take the selection of vocabulary, for example. There is no standard dictionary yet, and even a standard vocabulary list cannot be found. Often, the selection of several synonyms causes a great deal of trouble. For example, kinship terms vary from place to place. The textbooks use the northern words "爷爷" (yéye, grandfather), "奶奶" (nǎinai, grandmother), and "姥姥" (lǎolao, maternal grandmother). Many teachers from other places have written to say that they are not used to hearing these terms, and they question why the editors did not use the terms commonly used in their local areas. If there is no standard vocabulary, and if the requirements of all regions are to be met, then it will be necessary to use classical Chinese vocabulary such as "祖父" (zǔfù, grandfather), "祖母" (zǔmǔ, grandmother), and "外祖母" (wàizǔmǔ, maternal grandmother) to teach children. The names of some things vary from place to place. What is the best term to use in textbooks: "玉米" (yùmǐ, corn), "苞谷" (bāogǔ, corn), "苞米" (bāomǐ, corn), or "棒子" (bàngzi, corn)? Or should none of these be used, and instead use "玉蜀黍" (yùshǔshǔ, corn), and let teachers in various places translate it using the local name? Is this a good way to do it? Even if this is done, there needs to be a standard to define it.

The difficulties encountered in grammar are no less than those in vocabulary. The first hurdle is the problem of word boundaries. Establishing the concept of words is the first step in language teaching. What is a word, what is not a word? Although there is much discussion, no definitive conclusion has been reached that is sufficient as a standard for word segmentation. Textbooks also talk about words and select some examples, but these examples only pick those that are obvious and are estimated not to cause questions to be used as specimens. While selecting, one is constantly worried that students will raise questions beyond the examples that not only the teacher cannot answer, but also the textbook editor cannot answer, and even asking language experts cannot give a definitive answer. There are also many problems in morphology and syntax. Even today, how many word classes are there in Chinese, which ones, what signs are used to identify parts of speech, what are the rules for changes in parts of speech, what is the structure of Chinese syntax, what components are there... These questions are truly "hotly debated," and even the definition of what is a subject and what is an object in a sentence has not been finalized. This situation hinders the important task of educating students using the laws of Chinese as a science, and it also reduces the quality of Chinese language teaching.

Due to the differences in dialects in phonetics, there are also many difficulties in teaching. The phonetic transcriptions in the textbooks are based on Beijing pronunciation, but some detailed issues, such as the issues of "读音" (dúyīn, pronunciation) and "语音" (yǔyīn, phonetics), tone, neutral tone, retroflex ending, and tone sandhi, also do not have clear standards to follow. The phonetic transcriptions in the textbooks are treated as mere formalities by teachers in some areas, who still pronounce them according to their own local pronunciations. Some teachers cannot grasp the corresponding rules between local pronunciations and standard pronunciations and pronounce them in a mixture of dialects. The elementary school Chinese language subject originally has a major task of forming and promoting the national common language, but this task cannot be well completed due to the lack of established phonetic standards.

Our Party and government have always been very concerned about and attached great importance to this issue. Recently, two related conferences, the National Language Reform Conference and the Academic Conference on the Standardization of Modern Chinese, were convened successively, making important decisions on the standardization of Chinese.

The National Language Reform Conference passed a resolution to vigorously promote Mandarin Chinese, the common language of the Han nationality, with northern dialects as the basic dialect and Beijing pronunciation as the standard pronunciation. With this resolution, our language, both spoken and written (including textbooks, of course), has clear standards. All Han people must speak and write according to this standard. As far as Chinese language education is concerned, we must teach and learn according to this standard. As for the many specific tasks of Chinese standardization, the Academic Conference on the Standardization of Modern Chinese also passed a resolution to carry them out in a planned and step-by-step manner.

Simultaneous with the standardization of Chinese, the National Language Reform Conference also passed a resolution on the reform of the characters used to record Chinese – square Chinese characters. In accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, "Writing must be reformed and must move in the common phonetic direction of world writing," much preparatory work must be done before phoneticization is achieved, of which simplifying and organizing Chinese characters is an important task. The conference passed the revised draft of the Chinese Character Simplification Plan proposed by the Chinese Writing Reform Committee and the draft of the first batch of Variant Character Collation Table. This measure is of great significance to Chinese language education.

The benefits of character simplification are unanimously recognized.

How much effort have many teachers put into teaching young children to recognize one square character after another, and how much effort have many young children put into recognizing one square character after another. Chinese character reform is indeed too necessary.

The fundamental reform of Chinese characters is phoneticization. During the preparation for phoneticization, simplifying Chinese characters plays a major role. Do not think that a few strokes more or less in a character is not a big deal. From the perspective of literacy teaching, from the perspective of thousands of children learning to read, this is not a small matter, but a big matter.

Writing is a symbol for recording language. The things that need to be taught to young children through language are restricted because it is difficult to recognize this symbol. Words like "猪" (zhū, pig), "鸡" (jī, chicken), "学校" (xuéxiào, school), "读书" (dúshū, read books), some are already familiar to children, some should be taught to them, but all of them caused hesitation when used in the first volume of textbooks because these characters have many strokes and are difficult to recognize. It is okay for "工人" (gōngrén, worker) to appear in the textbook, but it is problematic for "农民" (nóngmín, farmer) to appear. Why? The character "农" (nóng, agriculture) has thirteen strokes, which is difficult. Because it is difficult to read, the amount of literacy must be reduced, and the speed of literacy must be slowed down, and the amount and speed of mastering knowledge must be reduced accordingly.

Now that a batch of characters has been simplified and a batch of variant characters has been abolished, the benefits to literacy teaching are not small. Needless to say, textbooks should be the first to adopt them. Of course, some textbooks are technically limited and cannot adopt them all because there are not enough copper molds; some textbooks are limited by supply time and cannot adopt them immediately because textbooks need to be supplied to the whole country and must be published in advance. For example, textbooks for next spring have already been published, so simplified characters cannot be fully used. However, the newly compiled elementary school Chinese textbooks are made using handwritten typesetting and have decided to adopt them immediately. Other elementary school textbooks should also adopt them as early as possible. We believe that this will help improve the quality of teaching.

The difficulty of literacy will inevitably reduce the quality of teaching. The Chinese language textbooks in Soviet primary schools and the Chinese language textbooks in our primary schools are a clear contrast. The Soviet primary school stage is four years, and the Chinese language textbooks alone (not including grammar textbooks) have more than 800,000 words when translated into Chinese. Our primary school stage is six years, and the Chinese language textbooks (and there are no grammar textbooks) total only 250,000 words. This is not a formal numerical problem, but a question of whether the content is rich or not. One of the important reasons for this disparity must be the difference in the difficulty of writing. Let's compare the Chinese language textbooks used by blind children in our country with the Chinese language textbooks used by normal children. Because the textbooks used by blind children are in phonetic script, their content is much richer than the textbooks used by normal children. Blind children use touch to read, and have to feel each letter one by one with their hands, and the learning conditions are much worse than those of normal children. However, just because one is in phonetic script and the other is in square Chinese characters, there is such a difference in learning conditions.

The reform of Chinese characters must follow the direction of phoneticization. Just from the perspective of Chinese language education, it is enough to show that this is true and unquestionable.

　　小学教科书和汉语规范问题
　　人民教育出版社小学语文编辑室主任　蒋仲仁
    教科书是我们国家对下一代进行共产主义教育的重要工具。教科书的内容必须正确；要表达正确的内容，必须用正确的语言。就教的人来说，要凭借写在教科书上的语言来传达正确的思想，来传达各种科学知识；就学的人来说，要凭借写在教科书上的语言来领会正确的思想，来获得各种科学知识。假如教科书上的语言没有规范，不能够使人得到共同的正确的理解，那末，教科书的任务就不能完成。苏联教育科学家凯洛夫院士在他所著“教育学”里论及教科书的时候，曾经引过一句话：“教科书上的一个字，一个定义，都应当经过衡量。”
    我们的国家是一个团结的统一的国家。作为教育的重要工具的教科书，也必须是全国统一的，依照国家的教育的方针、政策，在全国范围之内，凭借统一的教材来进行教育工作。因此，写在教科书上的语言，必须是统一的共同的语言，而不应该是，也不可能是那些应用范围极为狭小的地域方言。——这里说的语言是指汉民族的语言，其他兄弟民族有的用本民族的语言编写教科书，有的用汉语写的教科书来作翻译或改写的根据。
    正确的语言，规范的语言，全民的共同语言，这是编写教科书的必要的要求。
    汉民族的共同的语言，很久以来，已经逐渐形成；可是，汉语规范化的要求没有像今天这样迫切地提出来过，有关规范的问题也没有得到明确的解决。汉语在口头上的方言纷歧，在书面上的某些混乱，这都给教科书编写工作带来不少的困难。
    由于现代汉语的规范不明确，编写教科书用的语言没有可以依据的准则，书面语言的某些混乱现象不免也反映到教科书上来。有的教科书在语言上有时还沿用一些非现代的古旧的文言词汇和语法，有的教科书选取的译文，用了一些非汉语的生硬的外来语成分。不少学生反映，这样的教科书不容易使人得到鲜明的确切的理解；不少教师反映，用这样的教科书来进行教学，有时不得不花一些功夫来作语言上的讲解。这种情况使教育工作的质量直接受到不少的损害。
    汉语没有明确的规范，小学语文教科书受到的影响更大了。小学语文教科书是用来教儿童学习语言的。用什么语言来教给儿童，这种语言的语音、词汇和语法有哪些基本的规律，什么算是合乎规范的榜样，什么算是违反规范的错误：这些问题都是编写小学语文教科书的先决问题。
    就拿选用词汇来说吧。现在还没有一本标准的词典，连一个标准的词汇表也找不着，往往为了几个等义词的选择，何去何从，大费周章。例如亲属的称谓各地不同，教科书上用了北方话的“爷爷”
  “奶奶”“姥姥”，好些地方的教师都来信，说他们听不惯，并且责问编者为什么不用他们当地习用的称谓。假如没有一个标准的词汇，假如都要满足各地方的要求，那就势必要拿出“祖父”“祖母”
  “外祖母”这样的文言词汇来教给儿童了。有些东西各地的名称不一样。“玉米”，“苞谷”，“苞米”，“棒子”，教科书上究竟用什么好呢？或者都不用，用“玉蜀黍”，让各地方教师用当地的名称去翻译，这样办，好吗？即令这样办，也须要有个规范把它确定下来。
    语法方面遇到的困难也不下于词汇。第一关就碰到词的界限的问题。建立词的观念是语言教学的第一步。什么是词，什么不是词，议论虽多，可都没有成为定论，足够作为分词的规范。教科书上也讲到词，也选了一些例子，可是这些例子只是拣那些显而易见的估计起来不至发生疑问的来做个标本。一面选，一面捏一把汗，生怕学生在例子以外提出问题，不仅教师不能回答，教科书编者也不能回答，请教语言学专家也不能肯定地回答。词法上和句法上的问题也不少。一直到今天，汉语词类究竟有几类，哪几类，辨识词性靠什么标志，词性的变化有什么规律，汉语句法的结构怎样，有哪些成分，……这些个问题，真所谓“聚讼纷纭”，甚至于连一句话什么是主语什么是宾语都未成定论。这种情况阻碍了把汉语当做科学用它的规律来教育学生的这个重要工作的进行，也就降低了语文教学的质量。
    语音方面由于方言纷歧，教学上也有不少困难。教科书上的注音是按北京语音来注的，可是一些细致的问题，如“读音”和“语音”的问题，声调问题，轻声问题，儿化问题，连字变调问题，也都没有明确的规范可以依据。教科书上的注音，有的地区的教师把它“视同具文”，仍然照他们自己的方音念，有些教师对于方音和标准音的对应规律不能掌握，念得“南腔北调”。小学语文科对民族共同语的形成和推广本来负有重大的任务，可是由于语音规范没有确立，这个任务不能很好地完成。
    我们的党和政府对这个问题一直十分关怀和重视。最近，连续召集了两个有关的会议，全国文字改革会议和现代汉语规范问题学术会议，作出了关于汉语规范的重要决定。
    全国文字改革会议通过了大力推广以北方话为基础方言、以北京语音为标准音的普通话——汉民族共同语的决议。有了这个决议，我们的语言，口头的和书面的（当然包括教科书在内）这就有了明确的规范，全汉族人民都得按这个规范来说、来写，就语文教育工作说，得按这个规范来教、来学。至于汉语规范的许多具体工作，现代汉语规范问题学术会议也通过了决议，要有计划地有步骤地开展起来。
    和汉语规范化的同时，对记录汉语的文字——方块汉字的改革，全国文字改革会议也通过了决议。依照毛主席的指示，“文字必须改革，要走世界文字共同的拼音方向”，在实现拼音化以前，要做许多准备工作，其中简化和整理汉字是重要的一项。会议通过了中国文字改革委员会提出的汉字简化方案修正草案和第一批异体字整理表草案。这种措施对语文教育工作来说，意义是重大的。
    汉字简化的好处，这是大家一致公认的了。
    为了教小孩子认识一个一个的方块字，多少老师费尽了心血，为了认识一个一个的方块字，多少小孩子花尽了功夫。汉字改革确实是太必要了。
    汉字的根本改革是拼音化。在拼音化的准备期间，简化汉字有很大的作用。不要认为一个字多几笔少几笔没什么大不了，从识字教学来看，从千千万万小孩子学习识字来看，这不是一件小事，是一件大事。
    文字是记录语言的符号。要通过语言来教给小孩子的东西，因为认识这个符号很困难，不能不受到限制。“猪”“鸡”“学校”“读书”这些个词，有的是小孩子已经熟习了的，有的是应该教给他们的，可都为了这些字笔画多，难认识，用在第一册课本的时候，大费踌躇。课本上出现“工人”可以，出现“农民”就有问题，为什么？“农”字十三笔，难。识字难，识字的量就不能不减少，识字的速度就不能不放慢，掌握知识的量和速度，也就不得不相应地降低了。
    现在简化了一批字，废除了一批异体字，这对识字教学的好处是不小的。不用说，教科书就要首先采用。当然，有的教科书受到技术的限制，不能全部采用，因为没有足够的铜模；有的教科书受到供应时间的限制，不能立刻采用，因为教科书要供应全国用，不能不提前出版，比如明年春季的教科书现在已经出版，简化字就不能全用进去。可是，新编的小学语文课本是用手写制版的，决定立刻采用。其他小学教科书也要尽可能地提前采用。我们相信，这样一来，对教学质量的提高是有帮助的。
    识字的困难，必然减低教学的质量。苏联小学的语文教科书和我国小学语文教科书就是一个鲜明的对比。苏联小学阶段是四年，语文科单是阅读的课本（语法课本还不计算在内）译成中文就有八十多万字，我们小学阶段是六年，语文课本（此外并没有语法课本）一共不过二十五万字。这不是一个形式上数字的问题，而是内容上丰富与否的问题。造成这个悬殊的重要原因之一不能不说是文字的难易的不同。又用我们国家盲童用的语文课本和正常的儿童用的语文课本来比较一下。盲童用的课本因为是拼音文字，它的内容比正常儿童用的课本要丰富得多。盲童是用触觉来识字的，得用手一个一个地摸，学习条件比正常的儿童差得多。可是，就因为一种是用拼音文字，一种是用方块汉字，学习情况就有这样的差别。
    汉字的改革一定要走拼音化的方向，光从语文教育的角度来看，已经足够说明，这是千真万确，无可怀疑的。
