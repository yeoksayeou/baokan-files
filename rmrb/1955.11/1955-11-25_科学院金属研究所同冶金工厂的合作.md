Cooperation between the Institute of Metal Research of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Metallurgical Factories
　　Long Qiwei
　　Since its establishment in 1953, the Institute of Metal Research of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has established cooperative relationships with various metallurgical factories. Research projects related to metallurgical production account for a large proportion of the institute's overall research plan. For example, this year, 60 percent of the Institute of Metal Research's research projects are in cooperation with existing iron and steel enterprises (excluding cooperation with newly built iron and steel enterprises). These research projects have all signed cooperation contracts with relevant metallurgical factories, and thus have also received active support from the factories. The main cooperative partners of the Institute of Metal Research are Anshan Iron and Steel Company and Fushun Steel Plant. This year, cooperative relationships have also been established with Benxi Iron and Steel Company and Dalian Steel Plant. The scope of cooperation includes smelting, processing, metal physics, refractory materials, mineral processing, and chemical analysis. In the past two years, through this cooperative relationship, assistance has been provided to various metallurgical factories to solve some important scientific and technological problems, and research results have been rapidly applied to industrial practice; at the same time, through cooperation, production has also put forward tasks for research work, enriched the content of research work, and promoted the advancement of scientific research work.

　　In the past two years, in coordination with the construction of new iron and steel bases in Baotou and Wuhan, the Institute of Metal Research has carried out a large amount of mineral processing and refractory material testing work, providing design data for plant construction. The new steel grade smelting test in cooperation with a certain steel plant this year has proved that the cracking defects in this plant's products in the past can be reduced a lot. At the same time, the distribution of hydrogen in annealed ingots was also studied in conjunction with this work. In order to expand the scope of use of ductile iron, research on the processing of ductile iron was carried out, and the results indicated that some mechanical properties can be improved and enhanced after processing. The oxygen steelmaking research in cooperation with a certain steel plant this year has proven through three carbon steel oxygen blowing tests that the smelting time can be shortened by 15 to 20 percent, and electricity can be saved by 10 to 20 percent. This factory is now preparing to promote it in production. High-furnace bricks in cooperation with Anshan Iron and Steel Company have been successfully trial-produced, and both the output and quality have reached Soviet standards. This work has been commended by the Ministry of Heavy Industry. The research on internal friction in metals has put forward new views on the blue brittleness and tempering brittleness of steel, and has expanded the application range of the internal friction method in many other practical works, providing new avenues for further research on the mechanical properties and structure of metals. The following discusses some of the main situations and problems in the cooperation process between the Institute of Metal Research and factories.

　　Improvement of Cooperation Content
　　In the past, the content of cooperation between the Institute of Metal Research and various metallurgical factories was mostly to study the technical problems that urgently needed to be solved in current production. This situation was inseparable from the state of China's metallurgical industry at that time, the foundation of scientific research work of the Institute of Metal Research, and the situation of cadres. At that time, the factories had just recovered, the experimental research forces of the factories had not yet had time to be organized, and the research institutes of the industrial departments had not expanded. Under these circumstances, the Institute of Metal Research of the Chinese Academy of Sciences should not fail to undertake the research work on the production technology problems of some key enterprises; on the other hand, most of the metallurgical research cadres of the Institute of Metal Research were young, generally lacked practical production knowledge, and directly engaged in the research of factory and mine production technology problems, which could supplement knowledge in this aspect and increase confidence.

　　Today, the situation of China's metallurgical industry has changed. The experimental research forces of various metallurgical factories have been gradually organized, and the research institutes of the industrial departments are being expanded and strengthened. Some production analysis and experimental research work can gradually be undertaken by themselves. In this way, the requirements of metallurgical factories for the research departments of the Academy of Sciences are also getting higher and higher. They do not particularly welcome the researchers of the Academy of Sciences to spend a lot of effort to study the technical problems that they can solve themselves. If this is not recognized, and cooperation continues in the old way, it will not only leave many important scientific problems and basic theoretical work unattended, hinder the work of the Academy of Sciences in training professional research cadres, but also affect the initiative and enthusiasm of factories for experimental research work, and affect the growth of the experimental research forces of the factories themselves because the scientific research institutes excessively undertake the work that the factories can undertake themselves. On the other hand, the production technology level of factories is increasing day by day, and it is gradually found that some problems cannot be solved without systematic research. Therefore, according to this new situation, the Institute of Metal Research has increased research work with relatively long-term and systematic nature. For example, the cooperation with Anshan Iron and Steel Company on "Manganese System for Smelting High-Quality Steel in Alkaline Open Hearth Furnace," the purpose of studying it is to find out the advantages and disadvantages of the high and low manganese content in steel during the smelting process from the theoretical and practical production, so as to confirm whether it is necessary to maintain the manganese content in steel at a certain level. If the test can prove that the manganese content can be lower, then the manganese content of pig iron in the blast furnace does not have to be specified above a certain limit, which will help increase the output of pig iron and save manganese ore. This is also a problem that is being debated scientifically and has not reached a satisfactory conclusion. This requires not only accumulating empirical data from production experiments, but also delving into some problems in the research of steelmaking physical chemistry processes. Such as the influence of manganese on the activity of oxygen in steel liquid. Therefore, such research work is not only a major scientific and technological problem in production, but also often a basic theoretical problem in science. In addition, theoretical problems indirectly related to production were also included as a cooperation content this year. This year, the Institute of Metal Research added a basic theoretical work "Mechanical Properties and Structure of Metals" in the cooperation contract with Angang. The purpose is to hope that the factory will care about and support this kind of work, put forward the problems that need to be studied from the perspective of actual needs, and provide actual steel samples. When the research institute has new research results, it will go to the factory to make scientific reports to increase the theoretical knowledge of the factory's technical personnel.

　　The above are more prominent examples, and other similar works will not be listed one by one. In short, this type of work should become the basic content of cooperation between the Institute of Metal Research and various metallurgical factories. Of course, this does not mean that all sudden tasks encountered in factories should be rejected indiscriminately regardless of the situation.

　　Improvement of Cooperation Methods
　　The cooperation methods between the Institute of Metal Research and various metallurgical factories are usually determined according to the nature of the work when signing the cooperation contract every year. There are mainly three types:

　　The first cooperation method is to carry out part or all of the work in the factory. Most of this type of work is work that must be carried out in the factory for production experiments, or promotion work. This cooperation method has gone through three stages: In the past, there were many problems that needed to be studied in production, and the senior researchers of the Institute of Metal Research were very lacking, so the method of combining production practice with work was adopted, and research interns were sent to the factory to study. They are familiar with the production process by participating in various experimental research work in the factory's laboratory. Then gradually transitioned to organizing them, so that they can be responsible for one or two professional work under the joint leadership of the research institute and the factory. Further, enable them to independently responsible for a test work in the factory under the principled guidance of senior researchers in the institute.

　　Is it necessary for all the work that is cooperated with the factory and basically carried out in the factory to go through these three stages? Of course not. This is not necessary if the leadership of senior researchers is sufficient and the research interns already have certain production knowledge (such as graduates of new types of universities in the future). In the process of socialist industrialization, the requirements of the metallurgical industry always exceed our old strength. We often lack experienced scientific research leaders in all aspects of a major. The Institute of Metal Research did so when it encountered this situation. Now it seems that the advantage of this method is that the strength grows quickly, and it can also help the factory solve some problems.

　　The second cooperation method is to entrust research tasks to the factory, and the work is basically carried out in the research institute. This method was adopted more in 1955. Even for the work of the first cooperation method, some of them have to be carried out in the laboratory due to the need to combine the research of basic theoretical work. This year, about 60 percent of all cooperative topics adopted this method of cooperation. This reflects the increased requirements for scientific and technological tasks entrusted by factories to solve. Many works are not scientifically existing results, or technologies that have been mastered by the laboratory, and can be directly applied as long as they are directly tested in production. For example, the central laboratory of the technology of using electrolysis to identify non-metallic inclusions in steel in cooperation with Angang did not first conduct systematic research in the laboratory to achieve stable test results, and directly applied it in the factory work; as a result, after consuming a lot of materials and labor, it was found that the error fluctuation range was very large. This is an experience lesson for both parties of the cooperation, indicating that in general, unsolved scientific problems and unmastered new technologies must first be researched in the laboratory before actual application or production experiments. Even work with more exploratory nature must first carry out some pure theoretical research before laboratory research. But currently, we only have one topic "Mechanical Properties and Structure of Metals" in cooperation with various metallurgical factories.

　　The third method is to establish a comprehensive team. More complex practical problems require comprehensive research in many aspects to solve, so it is necessary to form a comprehensive team of experts in relevant fields to conduct research. The Institute of Metal Research does not have good experience in this area.

　　Conscientiously Implement the Contract Inspection System
　　The Institute of Metal Research and various metallurgical factories this year conscientiously implemented the system of checking contracts on a quarterly basis, which played a great role in promoting the progress of cooperative work. In the first and second quarters of this year, the administrative and scientific and technological work responsible comrades of both the institute and the factory personally presided over the meeting to check the contract, and solved the problems in a timely manner, and the effect was very good. At the contract inspection meeting, the comrades of the factory can hear the comrades of the research institute report on the progress of the cooperative work, can put forward criticisms and suggestions on these work, and can put forward new requirements at the meeting. In this way, the research institute can be urged to complete the task on schedule, and pay attention to the possibility of practical application in the research work at any time. On the other hand, both parties can also put forward suggestions for improvement based on the shortcomings in contact and coordination, and make decisions for implementation in the next quarter. Before 1955, although there were written provisions on the contract inspection system in the contract, it was never seriously implemented, so the cooperation contract did not play its supervisory role. The experience in the first half of this year proves the necessity of conscientiously implementing this system. We will continue to adhere to this system in the future.

　　科学院金属研究所同冶金工厂的合作
　　龙期威
    中国科学院金属研究所自一九五三年成立后，便同各冶金工厂建立了合作关系。全所研究计划中配合冶金生产的研究项目占了很大的比重。如今年金属研究所研究计划中百分之六十的项目是配合现有钢铁企业的（配合新建钢铁企业的未计算在内）。这些研究工作都同有关的冶金工厂签订了合作合同，因而也得到了工厂的积极支持。金属研究所合作的主要对象是鞍山钢铁公司、抚顺钢厂。今年又同本溪钢铁公司和大连钢厂建立了合作关系。合作范围包括冶炼、加工、金属物理、耐火材料、选矿和化学分析。两年来，通过这种合作关系，协助各冶金工厂解决了一些重要的科学技术问题，并把研究成果迅速应用到工业实践中去；同时，通过合作，生产也给研究工作提出了任务，丰富了研究工作的内容，推动科学研究工作前进。
    两年多来，金属研究所配合包头、武汉新钢铁基地的建设，进行了大量的选矿和耐火材料试验工作，为建厂提供了设计数据。今年同某钢厂合作的新钢种冶炼试验，证明过去这个厂产品中的发裂缺陷可以减少很多。同时，结合这项工作还研究了氢在退火钢锭中分布的情况。为了扩大球墨铸铁的使用范围，进行了球墨铸铁加工的研究，结果指出经过加工后某些机械性能还可以改善、提高。今年同某钢厂合作的氧气炼钢研究，经过三次碳素钢吹氧试验，已证明可以缩短冶炼时间百分之十五到二十，并可以省电百分之十到二十左右。这个厂现正准备在生产中推广。同鞍山钢铁公司合作的高炉砖已试制成功，产量和质量都达到了苏联标准。这项工作曾受到重工业部的表扬。金属中内耗的研究，已经提出了钢的蓝脆和回火脆的新看法，并在许多其他实际工作中扩大了内耗方法的应用范围，为进一步研究金属力学性质和结构提供了新的途径。下面谈谈金属研究所在同工厂合作过程中的一些主要情况和问题。
      合作内容的改进
    过去，金属研究所同各冶金工厂合作的内容，大多是研究当前生产上迫切需要解决的技术问题。这种情况是同那时我国冶金工业的状况，金属研究所科学研究工作的基础和干部情况分不开的。那时，各工厂刚刚恢复，工厂试验研究力量还没有来得及组织起来，产业部门的研究所还没有扩大。在这种情况下，科学院金属研究所不应该不担任一些重点企业的生产技术问题的研究工作；另一方面，金属研究所的冶金研究干部多为青年，一般缺乏生产实际知识，直接从事厂矿生产技术问题的研究，可以补充这一方面的知识，增加信心。
    今天，我国冶金工业的情况已经有了变化。各冶金工厂的试验研究力量已逐步组织起来，产业部门的研究所正在扩大和加强，若干生产分析和试验研究工作逐渐已能自己担任。这样，冶金工厂对科学院研究部门的要求也就越来越高了，他们并不特别欢迎科学院的研究人员用很大的力量去研究他们自己可以解决的技术问题。如果不认识到这一点，而仍旧按照老样子合作下去，就不仅会使许多生产上重要的科学问题和基本理论的工作没有人担任，对科学院培养专业研究干部的工作有妨碍，而且也将因为科学研究所过多地包揽了工厂自己可以担任的工作，影响到工厂对试验研究工作的主动性和积极性，影响到工厂本身试验研究力量的生长。另一方面，工厂生产技术水平日益提高，逐渐发现有些问题如果不进行系统的研究便不可能解决。所以，金属研究所根据这种新的情况，增加了比较长远性和系统性的研究工作。例如同鞍山钢铁公司合作的
  “碱性平炉熔炼优质钢的锰制度”，研究它的目的是希望从理论上及实际生产中找出熔炼过程中钢含锰量高低的优点和缺点，以肯定究竟是否一定需要将钢中含锰量维持在一定水平。如果试验能够证明含锰量低一些也可以的话，那末，高炉生铁便不必规定锰的含量在一定限度以上，这对于提高生铁产量有帮助，而且可以节约锰矿。这在科学上也是一个正在争论、而没有得出令人满意结论的问题。这就须要不仅从生产试验上积累经验数据，而且应当深入到研究炼钢物理化学过程的一些问题。如锰对钢液中氧的活度的影响等。因此，这样的研究工作不仅是生产上的重大科学技术问题，而且往往是科学上的基本理论性的问题。另外，同生产间接有关的理论性问题，今年也列入一项作为合作内容。今年金属研究所在同鞍钢的合作合同中增加了一项基本理论性的工作“金属的力学性质与结构”。目的是希望工厂关心支持这类工作，从实际需要方面提出须要研究的问题，并供给实际钢样。研究所有了新的研究结果，便去工厂作科学报告，增加工厂技术人员的理论知识。
    以上所列举的是比较突出的例子，其他类似的工作便不一一列举了。总之，这类性质的工作，应当成为金属研究所同各冶金工厂合作的基本内容。当然，这不是说，凡是遇到工厂中的突击性任务，都不分情况地一概加以拒绝。
      合作方式的改进
    金属研究所同各冶金工厂合作的方式，通常是在每年签订合作合同的时候按照工作性质确定下来的。主要有三种：
    第一种合作方式，是在工厂进行一部或全部工作。这类工作大多是必须在工厂进行生产试验的工作，或者是推广工作。这种合作方式曾经历过三个阶段：过去，生产上须要研究的问题较多，金属研究所高级研究人员又很缺乏，所以就采取生产实习同工作相结合的方式，派遣研究实习员到工厂中去学习。使他们在参加工厂试验室的各项试验研究工作中，熟悉生产过程。然后逐步过渡到把他们组织起来，使他们在研究所和工厂共同领导下，担任一两项专业工作。进一步，使他们能在所内高级研究人员原则性的指导下，在工厂独立负责一项试验工作。
    是不是所有同工厂合作的而基本上在工厂进行的工作都必须经历这三个阶段呢？当然不是。在高级研究人员的领导力量足够多和研究实习员已经具有一定的生产知识（如以后新型大学毕业生）的情况下，这是不必要的。在社会主义工业化的过程中，冶金工业的要求总是超过我们旧有的力量的。我们往往在一项专业的各方面都缺乏有经验的科学研究领导人员。金属研究所遇到这种情况，便按照前述办法做了。现在看来，这种办法的好处是力量生长得快，也可以协助工厂解决一些问题。
    第二种合作方式，由工厂委托研究任务，工作基本上在研究所进行。这种方式，在一九五五年较多地采用了。即使是前一种合作方式的工作，也有一部分由于要结合基本理论工作的研究，而必须在试验室中进行。今年采用这种方式合作的约占全部合作题目的百分之六十。这里反映出工厂委托解决的科学技术任务的要求提高了，许多工作不是科学上已有的成果，或者是试验室已掌握的技术，只要直接在生产上进行试验就可以直接应用。例如同鞍钢合作的用电解法鉴定钢中非金属夹杂物的技术，中央试验室没有先经过试验室的系统研究，达到稳定检验结果，便直接在工厂工作中运用起来；结果，耗费了大量材料和劳动力之后，才发现误差波动范围很大。这对于合作的两方面都是一个经验教训，说明一般未解决的科学问题和未掌握的新技术，都必须在实际应用或生产试验之前，先要进行试验室的研究工作。甚至带有更多摸索性的工作，还必须在试验室研究之前，先进行一些纯理论性的研究。但是目前我们同各冶金工厂合作工作中还只有“金属的力学性质与结构”这一个题目。
    第三种方式是建立综合小组。比较复杂的实际问题，须要多方面的综合研究才能解决，因此需要把有关方面的专家组成综合小组进行研究。在这方面，金属研究所还没有很好的经验。
      切实执行合同检查制度
    金属研究所和各冶金工厂今年切实执行了按季检查合同的制度，对督促合作工作的进行，起了很大作用。今年第一季和第二季，所、厂双方的行政和科学技术工作负责同志都亲自主持检查合同的会议，及时解决了问题，效果很好。在合同检查会议上，工厂的同志可以听到研究所同志汇报合作工作的进行情况，可以对这些工作提出批评和建议，并可以在会议上提出新的要求。这样便可以督促研究所如期完成任务，并随时在研究工作中注意到实际应用的可能性。另一方面，双方还可以针对联系配合方面的缺点提出改进意见，作出决定，在下季执行。一九五五年以前，合同上虽然也有过合同检查制度的文字规定，但是始终没有认真执行过，因而合作合同没有发挥它的督促作用。今年上半年的经验证明了切实执行这个制度的必要性。我们今后还要继续坚持这个制度。
