　　The State Physical Culture and Sports Commission and other units issue a joint instruction to promote children's radio calisthenics in primary schools nationwide.

　　The State Physical Culture and Sports Commission, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Health, the Broadcasting Administration Bureau, the National Committee for the Protection of Children of the Chinese People, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, and the Chinese Musicians Association jointly issued a directive on November 19 regarding the promotion of children's radio calisthenics in primary schools nationwide.

　　The directive stated that children's radio calisthenics are designed according to the physiological characteristics of children aged seven to eight in the first and second grades of elementary school, and have the effect of promoting normal physical development, enhancing physical fitness, cultivating correct posture, and enabling children to acquire basic motor skills. This set of calisthenics should be universally promoted in primary schools nationwide. Education administrative departments at all levels and administrative leaders of primary schools must use various practical and feasible methods to first organize primary school physical education teachers to learn children's radio calisthenics and enable them to correctly master the key points of its movements.

　　The directive pointed out: Children's radio calisthenics can be used as pre-class exercises or morning exercises for first and second grade students in elementary school, and can also be used as between-class exercises in winter. When children are learning to do the exercises, teachers should patiently explain the movements of each section using clear, simple, and easy-to-understand vocabulary, especially demonstrating them correctly, and implementing sectional teaching. After the students have learned the movements of each section, they should then teach the children to connect the entire set of movements and do the exercises to the accompaniment of broadcast music. When teachers teach children to do the exercises, they must demand correct posture in order to achieve good results. Relevant departments should also do a good job of publicizing this to primary school teachers and children, as well as children's parents, in order to promote the extensive and in-depth development of children's radio calisthenics.

    指示中指出：儿童广播体操可作小学一、二年级学生的课前操或早操，冬季也可以作为课间操。在儿童学习做操的时候，教师应当耐心地用明白、通俗、易懂的词汇讲解各节动作，尤其应当正确示范，并且实行分节教学，等学生学会各节动作以后，再教儿童把整套动作连贯起来，随着广播乐曲做操。教师教儿童做操的时候，务必要求姿势正确，以收到良好的效果。各有关部门还应当向小学教师和儿童，以及儿童的家长做好宣传工作，以利于推动儿童广播体操广泛深入的开展。
