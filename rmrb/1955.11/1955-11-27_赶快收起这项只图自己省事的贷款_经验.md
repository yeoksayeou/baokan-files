　　Quickly Put Away This Loan "Experience" That Only Seeks Convenience for Oneself

Editor:

    In the first half of this year, the People's Bank of Daren County, Shanxi Province, promoted an "experience" in issuing agricultural loans: agricultural production cooperatives would uniformly plan and collectively borrow; then the cooperative cadres would lend to the members; and after the autumn harvest, the cooperative would uniformly repay the loans. It is said that the advantage of this "experience" is that the bank's lending procedures are very simple, and the loan collection task can be guaranteed after the autumn harvest.

    Indeed, doing so is much easier for the bank than in the past. However, it has added many extra burdens to the cadres of agricultural production cooperatives. A series of specific tasks such as loan application, review, fund distribution, transfer accounting, and loan recovery must be done by the cadres of the agricultural production cooperatives, and many people find it difficult to cope. Some cooperative cadres misremembered the accounts because they were illiterate, and as a result had to compensate themselves. Some cooperative members heard that the cooperative director was in charge of the loans, and complained about the director when their loan applications were not approved; some cooperative members did not repay the loans after the autumn harvest, thinking that the cooperative director would take care of it anyway. All of these things made the cooperative cadres very embarrassed.

    In addition, since the promotion of this "experience", there have also been individual cases of cooperative cadres taking the opportunity to misappropriate or embezzle loans. For example, Chai Jinyuan, the production team leader of the Nan Shishan Agricultural Production Cooperative, borrowed 80 yuan in the name of the cooperative, embezzled more than 21 yuan from it, and distributed the rest of the money among several cadres; while Chai Fang, a poor peasant member of this cooperative, had to sell one and a half tile-roofed houses to make a living because he did not get a loan.

    After the Daren County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party discovered this problem in April of this year, it instructed the person in charge of the bank to immediately correct this practice. However, the bank treated this instruction as if it were water off a duck's back. After several urging sessions, the bank promised to issue a notice to stop handling collective loans. However, recently, a responsible comrade of the County Committee asked Deputy Director Han whether this practice had been corrected. The reply was: "The notice was issued a long time ago, and it has probably been corrected!" In fact, in September, 60 percent of the loans in Daren County were still collectively borrowed by agricultural production cooperatives.

    The People's Bank of Daren County should quickly put away this "experience" that only seeks convenience for itself, so that agricultural production cooperative cadres can reduce their extra burdens and concentrate on running the cooperatives well.

### 赶快收起这项只图自己省事的贷款“经验”

　　赶快收起这项只图自己省事的贷款“经验”编辑同志：
    山西省大仁县人民银行在今年上半年推广了一项发放农业贷款的“经验”：由各农业生产合作社统一计划，集体贷款；然后由社干部再放给社员；秋后又由社里统一归还。据说，这个“经验”的好处是：银行在放款的时候手续十分简便，秋收后又能保证收贷任务。
    的确，这样做对银行来说，工作比过去大为省事了。但是，对农业生产合作社的干部来说，却增加了很多额外负担。像贷款中申请、审查、分款转账、收贷等一系列具体工作，都要由农业生产合作社的干部来做，很多人感到难于胜任。有些社干部因为不识字，记错账，结果还得自己赔钱。有些社员听说社长掌握贷款，申请贷款没有被批准就埋怨社长；有些社员秋收不还贷款，认为反正有社长给顶着。这些，都使社干部很为难。
    此外，这项“经验”推广以后，也发生了个别合作社干部乘机挪用或贪污贷款的事件。像南石山农业生产合作社的生产队长柴进元用社的名义贷到八十元以后，从中贪污了二十一元多，又把其余的钱同几个干部分用了；而这个社的贫农社员柴芳却因为没有得到贷款而把一间半瓦屋卖掉来维持生活。
    中共大仁县委会在今年四月间发现了这个问题以后，就指示银行负责人立即纠正这种作法。银行却把这个指示当作一阵耳边风。经过几次督促，银行答应下达一个停止办理集体贷款的通知。但是，最近县委会负责同志问韩副行长是否已经纠正了这种做法。答复是：“早下通知了，大概纠正啦！”事实上，九月份大仁县仍然有百分之六十的贷款，是由农业生产合作社集体贷走的。
    大仁县人民银行应该赶快收起这种只图自己省事的“经验”，让农业生产合作社干部减轻额外负担，集中精力把社办好。　陈喜茂
