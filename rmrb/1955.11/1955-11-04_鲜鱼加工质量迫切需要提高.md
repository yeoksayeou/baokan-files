Urgent Need to Improve the Quality of Fresh Fish Processing
Gao Shuyi, Deputy Director of the Aquatic Products Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture

    China's fisheries are developing, and the catch is increasing year by year. However, we are currently facing an acute problem: the processing of fresh fish is lagging far behind the increase in catch volume. Taking effective measures to resolve this contradiction is of great significance for current and future fisheries production.

    Fresh fish is a nutritious non-staple food. Maintaining the freshness of fish as much as possible and transporting and supplying it in a timely manner plays an important role in meeting the needs of the broad masses of people and increasing national accumulation. However, fisheries production is highly seasonal, and fish come to market in a very concentrated period. Fish contain a lot of moisture and are prone to spoilage. Currently, there are very few freezing plants and canneries in China. Therefore, simple processing methods such as salting and drying have historically been used during the peak fishing season to handle about half of the total national fish production. However, due to the rudimentary processing equipment, insufficient quantities, and outdated processing methods, the quality of salted and dried fish is very poor. Sometimes, large quantities of fish are left to rot and are dumped into the sea because they cannot be processed in time. Many salted and dried fish on the market are smelly or too salty, and their prices are higher than other non-staple foods, so people are unwilling to buy them. This has led to slow sales or reduced sales of salted and dried fish. Even when salted and dried fish are out of stock, commercial institutions are not very willing to continue ordering them (of course, this attitude is incorrect). Some salted and dried fish prepared for export in some areas have also failed to be sold because they did not meet quality standards. The result of slow or reduced sales of salted and dried fish is that a large number of products are stockpiled. This not only affects the price of fresh fish, but also damages the enthusiasm of fishermen to expand reproduction. Improving the quality of salted and dried fish and expanding its sales has become an urgent requirement of the broad masses of fishermen, and we must pay attention to this issue.

    Is it possible to improve the quality of salted and dried fish? The answer is definitely yes. At present, there are some generally backward management ideas and practices in fresh fish processing that hinder the improvement of product quality. First, the production departments look down on salted and dried fish, as if they are only made to process fish that are not fresh or even have begun to spoil. In this way, the quality of salted and dried fish is naturally unlikely to be high. Second, in terms of processing technology, people mistakenly believe in the effectiveness of salt, thinking that the more salt is added, the more guaranteed the fish will not spoil; and when adding salt, they do not ask about the fineness and quality of the salt. There is also an incorrect idea that adding more salt can increase the weight of the product and sell it for more money. This kind of management thinking and practice is completely wrong. We once tasted Soviet salted and dried fish at the Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction Achievements Exhibition. This fish had a clean color and palatable flavor, which was very different from our salted and dried fish. The excellent quality of Soviet salted and dried fish is because it is processed from high-quality raw materials using scientific operating methods. This is exactly what we should learn from.

    The primary condition for improving the quality of salted and dried fish is to process it with high-quality raw materials. In order to ensure the freshness of raw materials, we should try our best to shorten the time of fresh fish transportation and loading and unloading, and process it in the fastest way. If conditions permit, it is better to process it directly at sea in a timely manner. For example, large-mouth fish in Northeast China and ribbonfish in Zhejiang are salted on board as they are caught, which is very beneficial for improving the quality of the products.

    The quality of salt is closely related to the quality of salted and dried fish. This is because good salt contains more sodium chloride, and the salt particles are fine and easily penetrate into the interior of the fish body to dehydrate it. Dehydration can play a preservative role and ensure the good taste of the product. In the Soviet Union, the nationally designated fishing salt is first-grade salt, and its sodium chloride content is as high as 97.5 percent. Coarse and mixed salt, in addition to sodium chloride, also contains a large amount of impurities such as magnesium chloride, magnesium sulfate, and calcium chloride. These things hinder the penetration and dehydration of salt, weaken the anti-corrosion power, taste bitter, and the product is also prone to moisture absorption and deterioration during storage. The fishing salt we currently use is generally this kind of coarse and mixed salt, with a sodium chloride content of only below 80 percent and many impurities. Tianjin Aquatic Products Company has used large-grained fishing salt for salting fish for many years, which not only resulted in inferior products, but also left a large amount of salt lacking after the fish was taken out of the pond, resulting in a lot of waste. Later, they ground the coarse salt into fine salt for salting fish, which saved 10 pounds of salt for every 100 pounds of fish salted, and the quality of the products also improved. However, because there is not enough grinding equipment, this method has not been applied to large-scale production. Therefore, the issue of the quality of fishing salt should be properly resolved with the support of the salt affairs authorities. In the future, the fishing salt supplied should be different from other industrial salt in terms of quality. The ingredients should be relatively pure, and the salt particles should be relatively fine, close to edible salt. As for the fisheries production departments, they should change the practice of using excessive amounts of salt in the future. In Qingdao, Yantai, Shidao and other places, the Shandong Aquatic Products Company often uses salt up to 40 percent of the raw materials for salting fish, and some places use even more salt than this. Using too much salt will not only destroy the protein in the fish body, but also cause serious waste. The correct approach should be: depending on the type of fish, the processing location, the processing season, and the storage period, formulate appropriate usage standards according to local conditions and in a timely manner, so that the processed products have a fresh and delicious flavor. Salted and dried fish with the least amount of salt should be stored in cold storage facilities such as cold storage and ice cellars.

    Although the processing method of salted and dried fish is relatively simple, it should also have considerable equipment. The processing plant of Tanggu Aquatic Products Transportation and Sales Company handles a considerable amount of fish every year, but it does not have proper handling and drying grounds, which is very unreasonable. The shrimp frying houses in Erjie Gully in Northeast China and the Zhoushan Fish Processing Plant cannot process during rainy days because they do not have drying equipment. In the future, processing plants in various places should gradually improve their equipment under the principle of economy. All equipment necessary for production, such as raw material processing sites for unloading, washing, and cutting fish, pickling ponds, drying grounds, baking rooms, smoking rooms, dryers, fish meal machines, warehouses, cold storage, ice cellars, etc., should be gradually built up according to needs and possibilities.

    In terms of operation, attention should be paid to the technical issues of salting and drying. Salt should be added so that the salt penetrates into all parts of the fish body; if the salt only wets the surface of the fish body, it will easily rot. Therefore, it is necessary to apply salt in layers and evenly distribute the salt so that it penetrates evenly. Pickling tools should be disinfected. The key to drying processing is to dry thoroughly. The degree of drying should be determined according to the requirements of transportation, sales and storage. High-dry products contain 15 to 30 percent moisture and can be stored for about half a year to a year; medium-dry products contain about 40 percent moisture and can be stored for about two to six months; soft-dry products contain more than 50 percent moisture; can only be stored for one month. When processing dry products for long-term long-distance sales, the method of removing the fish head and tail can be promoted. Zhoushan Fish Meal Factory uses heads and tails to make fish meal, which is of course more beneficial.

    Attention should also be paid to packaging and storage issues. At present, the packaging of salted and dried fish is very simple. Poor packaging will also directly affect the quality of the product. In the future, we must select appropriate packaging methods by using local materials. Warehouses for storing products and processing plants with relatively large-scale production must pay attention to facilities for heat prevention, moisture prevention, rat prevention, and insect prevention to avoid losses.

    In summary, the quality standards of salted and dried fish should include salt content, freshness, dryness, packaging and other main aspects; in the future, we should also learn from the Soviet experience, and the state should formulate specifications and conduct technical and hygiene inspections to promote the gradual improvement of the quality of salted and dried fish.

    鲜鱼加工质量迫切需要提高
    农业部水产管理总局副局长　高树颐
    我国的渔业正在发展，捕鱼量逐年增加。但是目前碰到了一个尖锐的问题，这就是鲜鱼的加工大大地落后于捕鱼量的增加。采取有效措施解决这一矛盾，对于当前和今后的渔业生产都有重要的意义。
    鲜鱼是一种具有丰富营养的副食品。尽可能保持鲜鱼的鲜度，及时地运销供应，对于供应广大人民的生活需要和增加国家的积累，都有重要的作用。但是，渔业生产有高度的季节性，鱼类上市非常集中，鱼类所含水分特多，容易腐烂。目前我国冷冻厂和罐头厂很少，因此历来都在鱼产旺季采取腌藏、干制的简单加工方法，来处理占全国鱼产总量一半左右的鲜鱼。但是，由于加工设备简陋、数量不足、加工方法落后，咸干鱼的品质很差；有时因不能及时加工，竟使大量鱼货腐坏而被倒在海里。目前市场上有许多咸干鱼发臭，或味太咸，再加价格比他种副食品高，因此人们不愿购买。这就造成了咸干鱼滞销或减销的现象。现在即使在咸干鱼脱销的时候，商业机构也不很愿意继续进货（当然这种态度是不对的）。有的地区准备出口的咸干鱼也因为不合质量标准而没能成交。咸干鱼滞销、减销的结果，使大量制品被积压。这不但影响了鲜鱼的价格，而且也损害了渔民扩大再生产的积极性。提高咸干鱼的品质，扩大它的销路，这已成为广大渔民的迫切要求，我们不能不重视这个问题。
    咸干鱼的品质究竟能不能改善呢？肯定地说，是可能的。目前在鲜鱼加工中普遍有一些落后的经营思想和作法，妨碍制品质量的提高。首先，是生产部门轻视咸干鱼，似乎只是为了处理不新鲜的甚至已开始腐败的鱼货，才制造咸干鱼。这样，咸干鱼的品质自然不可能不低劣了。其次，在加工技术上，人们误信食盐的功效，以为加盐越多，越能保证鱼货不会变坏；而且在加盐时也不问盐质的粗细好坏。还有一种不正确的念头，认为多加盐可以增加制品的重量，多卖钱。这种经营思想和作法是完全错误的。我们在苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会中，曾经尝过苏联的咸干鱼，这种鱼色泽洁净，风味适口，同我们的咸干鱼有很大的不同。苏联的咸干鱼的品质所以优良，是因为它是用上等原料经过科学的操作方法加工出来的。这正是值得我们学习的。
    提高咸干鱼的品质，首要条件是用上等原料加工。为了争取原料的鲜度，应当尽量设法缩短鲜鱼运输和装卸的时间，用最快的方法来加工。如果条件允许，直接在海上及时加工更好。如东北的大口鱼、浙江的盐带鱼，都在船中随捕随腌，对于提高制品的质量很有好处。
    盐的质量的优劣，同咸干鱼的品质好坏有很大关系。因为优良的盐含氯化钠的成分多，盐粒细，容易渗透到鱼体的内部起脱水作用，脱水可以起防腐的作用，并保证制品的良好味道。在苏联，国家规定的渔盐是一等盐，它的氯化钠含量高达百分之九十七点五。粗杂的盐，除氯化钠以外，还含有多量的氯化镁、硫酸镁、氯化钙等夹杂物，这些东西妨碍盐的渗透和脱水作用，削弱防腐力，味道也苦涩，而且制品在保藏中也容易回潮变质。我们目前所用的渔盐，普遍是这种粗杂的盐，氯化钠的含量只在百分之八十以下，杂质甚多。天津水产公司历年腌鱼都用大粒渔盐，不但制品低劣，而且鱼出池后，留存大批乏盐，浪费很多。后来他们把粗盐磨细腌鱼，每腌制百斤鱼可节省十斤盐，制品质量也有所提高。但因磨碎的设备不够，这个办法还没有应用于大量的生产。因此渔盐质量问题应当在盐务机关的支援下加以妥善解决，今后供应的渔盐，在质量上应不同于其他工业用盐，成分要比较纯，盐粒要比较细，接近于食用的盐。至于渔业生产部门，今后应改变用盐量偏高的作法。山东水产公司在青岛、烟台、石岛等地腌鱼用盐量，常达原料的百分之四十，有些地方的用盐量比这还要多。用盐过多，不但会破坏鱼体中的蛋白质，而且造成严重的浪费。正确的作法应当是：随着鱼的种类、加工地点、加工季节和保存期限的不同，因地因时制宜，订出适当的用量标准，使加工出的制品风味鲜美。加盐最少的咸干鱼，应利用冷藏库，冰窖等低温贮藏设备保存。
    咸干鱼加工的方法虽然比较简单，但是也应当有相当的设备。塘沽水产运销公司加工厂，每年处理鱼货数量相当大，但是没有适当的处理场和晒场，这是很不合理的。东北地区二界沟的炸虾房和舟山鱼类加工厂因为没有干燥设备，遇到雨天就无法加工。今后各地加工厂应在节约的原则下，逐步改善设备。凡生产上必需的设备，如卸鱼、洗鱼、割鱼的原料处理场，腌池、晒场、焙干室、熏室、干燥机、鱼粉机、仓库、冷藏库、冰窖等，应当依照需要和可能逐步建设起来。
    在操作方面，要注意盐藏和干燥的技术问题。加盐要使盐分渗透鱼体各部；如果盐分仅在鱼体表面浸润，就容易腐败。因此要作到层鱼层盐，撒盐均匀，渗透均匀。腌藏的工具应当经过消毒。干燥加工的关键，在于干得透。要依照运销和贮藏的要求，确定干燥的程度，上干品含水分百分之十五至三十，约可保存半年至一年；中干品含水分百分之四十左右，约可保存二至六个月，软干品含水分百分之五十以上；仅能保存一个月。加工长期远销的干制品时，除去鱼头鱼尾的办法，是可以提倡的。舟山鱼粉厂利用头尾，制成鱼粉，这样处理当然更有利。
    对于包装和贮藏的问题，也要加以注意。目前咸干鱼的包装，非常简陋。包装不好，也会直接影响制品的质量。今后必须就地取材，选择适当的包装方法。贮藏制品的仓库和比较大量生产的加工厂，必须注意防热、防潮、防鼠、防虫等设备，避免损耗。
    总起来说，咸干鱼品质的标准，应包括盐分、鲜度、干度、包装等主要方面；将来我们也应当学习苏联的经验，由国家制定规格，进行技术和卫生的检查，以促进咸干鱼品质的逐步提高。
