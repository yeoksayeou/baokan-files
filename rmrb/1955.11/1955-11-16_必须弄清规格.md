Specifications Must Be Clarified

　　In some counties in Southern Xinjiang, some staff members were not familiar with the business of purchasing animal products and lacked the ability to identify the grades of animal products, so they treated lamb wool as autumn wool and good wool as broken wool. In Bachu County, 41 kilograms of so-called waste products purchased by one staff member were inspected and found to be not waste products at all. Only 18 kilograms of autumn wool and 23 kilograms of broken wool were picked out from them. However, some purchasing departments, on the pretext that the business level of the purchasing staff was low and that they were afraid of not completing the task and paying compensation, did not correct this phenomenon, which affected the completion of the state's purchasing plan.

　　But is there no way to overcome the difficulty of low business level of purchasing personnel? The purchasing work in Yiwu County answered this question. They took many active steps, sending cadres to the pastoral areas to guide the purchasing work, and specifically helping the purchasing cadres to learn the technology of identifying product specifications and varieties. Some also brought various animal product samples to facilitate the comparison when the masses sold wool and sheepskins. And the price difference between regions was reasonably adjusted. As a result, the work of identifying product specifications was done relatively well. By the beginning of October, the annual purchasing plan for various animal products had been overfulfilled.

　  必须弄清规格
    南疆有些县在收购畜产品的工作中，由于有的工作人员不熟悉业务，缺乏鉴别畜产品等级的能力，竟将羔毛当秋毛，把好毛当碎毛。巴楚县一个工作人员收购的四十一公斤所谓废品中，经过检查，却根本不是什么废品，只从中拣出秋毛十八公斤，碎毛二十三公斤。但是，有些收购部门却借口收购工作人员业务水平低，怕完不成任务，怕赔款，对这种现象不加纠正，以致影响了完成国家的收购计划。
    可是，收购人员业务的水平低，就没有办法克服困难了吗？伊吾县的收购工作回答了这个问题。他们采取了许多积极的步骤，派干部深入各牧区指导收购工作，具体帮助收购干部学习鉴别产品规格、品种的技术。有的还带了各种畜产样品，便于群众出售羊毛、羊皮时进行比较。并合理地调整了地区之间的差价。这样做的结果，对产品规格的鉴别工作就做得比较好，到十月上旬，已超额完成了各种畜产品的年度收购计划。
