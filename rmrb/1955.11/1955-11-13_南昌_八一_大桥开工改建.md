　  Nanchang "August 1st" Bridge Reconstruction Commences
    The reconstruction project of the "August 1st" Bridge in Nanchang City officially commenced on November 7th. Most of the over twenty types of construction machinery have entered the construction site. Workers of more than thirty trades from all over the country have taken up their posts.
    The reconstruction of the "August 1st" Bridge is a major project in Nanchang City during the First Five-Year Plan. Nanchang is the political, economic, and cultural center of Jiangxi Province, and the "August 1st" Bridge is an important bridge connecting the province's highway transportation. This bridge was built in 1937 and suffered two serious bombings and destructions by the Kuomintang reactionaries and Japanese imperialism before liberation. After liberation, although it has been repaired over the years to maintain traffic, the bridge deck and piers were too severely damaged to meet transportation requirements. In addition, the bridge openings were small, so large ships could not pass through during floods. Now, in order to meet the requirements of national economic construction, it has been decided to replace the original wooden bridge deck with a reinforced concrete bridge deck, widen the bridge from 7.92 meters to 10 meters, build three new bridge piers, and partially reinforce the existing bridge piers. The steel beams will also be newly built and reconstructed. The newly built "August 1st" Bridge will also ensure safe navigation under the bridge during floods.
    The "August 1st" Bridge reconstruction project is scheduled to be completed before the end of September next year, and will be officially opened to traffic on National Day. (Our Nanchang Correspondent)

### 南昌“八一”大桥开工改建

　  南昌“八一”大桥开工改建
    南昌市“八一”大桥改建工程十一月七日正式开工。二十多种施工机械已大部进入施工现场。来自全国各地的三十多个工种工人已走上工作岗位。
    改建“八一”大桥是南昌市在第一个五年计划内的一项巨大工程。南昌是江西政治经济文化中心，
  “八一”大桥又是连系全省公路交通一座重要的桥梁。这座桥修建于一九三七年，解放前曾先后遭受国民党反动派和日本帝国主义两次严重的轰炸和破坏。解放后，虽然经过历年补修，维持了交通，但因桥身桥墩受损过重，不能适应运输要求，加上桥孔小，在洪水期间大船就不能通行。现在为了适应国家经济建设的要求，决定把原来大桥的木桥面改为钢筋混凝土桥面，桥宽由七点九二公尺扩宽到十公尺，并新建三座桥墩和部分加固桥墩，钢梁也进行新建和改建。新修建的“八一”大桥，并可以保证在洪水期间桥下的安全航行。
    改建“八一”大桥工程计划在明年九月底前全部完成，国庆节正式通车。（本报驻南昌记者）
