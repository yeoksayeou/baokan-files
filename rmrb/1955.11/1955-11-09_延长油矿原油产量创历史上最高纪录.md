    Yan Chang Oilfield Crude Oil Production Reaches Highest Historical Record
    The Yan Chang Oilfield in Shaanxi, which has more than forty years of exploitation history, has already overfulfilled the state plan for crude oil production seventy-six days ahead of schedule this year.
    This year's annual oil production has created the highest record in the mine's history, equivalent to 2.9 times that of 1953 and 1.1 times that of 1954.
    It is expected that this year, the mine's output will reach 80 percent of the planned target for 1957.
    These achievements of the Yan Chang Oilfield have been obtained with the help of Soviet experts and the joint efforts of all employees. At present, all the mine's employees are full of confidence and have proposed to work hard to produce more oil for the country. (Li Renlun)

    延长油矿原油产量创历史上最高纪录
    有四十多年开采历史的陕西延长油矿，今年原油的生产量已经提前七十六天超额完成了国家计划。
    今年的年产油量创造了这个矿历史上的最高纪录，等于一九五三年的二点九倍，等于一九五四年的一点一倍。
    今年预计，这个矿的产量将达到一九五七年计划指标的百分之八十。
    延长油矿的这些成绩，是在苏联专家的帮助和全体职工的共同努力之下所获得的。目前，全矿职工都信心百倍地提出要为国家生产更多的石油而努力。　（黎任伦）
