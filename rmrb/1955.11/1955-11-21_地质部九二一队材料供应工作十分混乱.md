　　Material Supply Work of Geological Department 921 Team Is Very Chaotic
    Editor:
    The material supply work of the 921 Team, which belongs to the Hydrogeology and Engineering Geology Bureau of the Ministry of Geology, is very chaotic. By October, the team had only completed 30% of its annual exploration tasks, but had already spent over 70% of its annual investment. From March to October, for eight months, the downtime of the team's drilling rigs waiting for materials accounted for more than 35% of the total production time, but the warehouse had accumulated 151 kinds of unusable equipment, worth more than 50,000 yuan.
    During the preparatory period from accepting the task to field exploration, the 921 Team sent a group of people to the construction site, and left another group to work in the Beijing and Tianjin area. However, the two sides did not communicate with each other and made purchases separately, resulting in many duplicated purchases of equipment. The team's repair shop only has two fitters, but they bought more than 100 files; the plan only required 20 kilograms of abrasive sand for oxy-acetylene welding, but they bought more than 100 kilograms. In addition, they purchased a large number of valuable sleepers, white casings, steel grit drill bits, and sedimentation pipes that did not meet the actual needs.
    The team once spent more than 1,700 yuan to print various material management forms sufficient for several years. Unfortunately, these forms have never been effective; the team lacks necessary procedures and systems for receiving and issuing materials, so that how much stuff is in the warehouse, how much it's worth, and what will be needed in the future are all a series of unknowns.
    The long-term chaotic situation in the material supply work of the 921 Team not only wastes a large amount of state funds, but also affects the work of other departments to a certain extent. It is hoped that they will quickly improve this situation.

### 地质部九二一队材料供应工作十分混乱

　　地质部九二一队材料供应工作十分混乱编辑同志：
    地质部水文地质工程地质局所属九二一队，材料供应工作十分混乱。到十月份，这个队的全年勘探任务只完成百分之三十，但是全年投资却已经用掉了百分之七十以上。从三月到十月的八个月中，这个队的钻机停工待料的时间竟占全部生产时间百分之三十五以上，但是仓库里却积压了不合使用的器材一百五十一种，价值五万多元。
    九二一队在接受任务到野外勘探的筹备期间，就派了一批人到工地去，又留下一批人在北京、天津一带工作。但是这两方面互不通气，各自采购，结果很多器材就买重了。这个队的修配间只有两个钳工，却买了一百多把锉刀；烧氧焊用的喷砂，计划上只要二十公斤，结果买了一百多公斤。此外，还购进了大批不合实际需要的贵重枕木、白套管、钢砂钻头和沉淀管等。
    这个队曾经花费一千七百多元印制了够用几年的各种管理器材的表格。遗憾的是，这些表格一直也没有起作用；队里在领发材料方面没有必要的手续和制度，以致仓库里有多少东西、值多少钱和今后还需要些什么，都是一连串的未知数。
    九二一队材料供应工作中长期存在着的混乱现象，不但浪费了国家大量资金，而且还在一定程度上影响了其它部门的工作。希望他们迅速改善这种状况。
