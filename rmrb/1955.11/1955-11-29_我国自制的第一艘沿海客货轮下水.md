　　China's First Domestically-Made Coastal Passenger-Cargo Ship Launched
    Our newspaper Shanghai, November 28th dispatch: On November 27th, the launching ceremony for the "Democracy No. 10," New China's first domestically-made coastal passenger-cargo ship, was held at the Huangpu pier. After a grand ceremony, this shining new sea vessel, amidst music and firecrackers, slowly left the pier and sailed smoothly and quickly towards the center of the river.
      The "Democracy No. 10" ship is the first coastal passenger-cargo ship designed and built by China itself, marking a new development in China's shipbuilding industry. The "Democracy No. 10" ship is eighty meters long, and its structure and navigation equipment are modern, with some parts using electrical controls. For example, the ship's bottom is double-layered, and each compartment has watertight equipment. If one compartment's bottom hits a reef and floods, this equipment will prevent water from penetrating the entire ship, and the ship can still navigate safely. The ship's installed electric echo sounder and electric log are automated. With just a push of a button by the navigator, the correct water depth and the distance traveled in nautical miles can be automatically measured.
    This beautiful new type of sea vessel provides passengers with a safe and comfortable travel environment. The ship has soft-berth cabins with spring mattresses, hard-berth cabins with leather sofas, and even the steerage cabins have sleeping berths, making it much more comfortable than typical sea vessels. A maternity and infant room is located in the center of the ship, as this is the area with the least amount of rocking. The upper deck also has separate isolation rooms for male and female patients. To fully ensure passenger safety, each passenger is provided with a life jacket, and lifeboats and life rafts are also available. In an emergency, lifeboats can be lowered into the water within one or two minutes. Each staircase on the ship is equipped with automatic fire extinguishers that will automatically activate when the temperature reaches a certain level. Powerful firefighting equipment is installed around the ship, with its spray reaching all parts of the ship. In addition, there are electrically operated anti-aircraft lights, fire alarm indicators, and emergency generators for safety.

　　我国自制的第一艘沿海客货轮下水
    本报上海二十八日电　十一月二十七日新中国第一艘自制的沿海客货轮——民主十号，在黄浦码头举行了开航典礼。在举行了隆重的仪式以后，这艘闪闪发光的新海轮在音乐声中和一片爆竹声中，徐徐离开了码头，平稳而快速地向江心驶去。
      “民主十号”轮船是我国自己设计，自己制造的第一艘沿海客货轮，它标志着我国造船工业的新发展。“民主十号”轮船的船身全长八十公尺，它的构造和航行设备都是近代化的，有的地方还使用电气操纵。例如船底是双层的，每个舱都有水密设备，如果一旦有一个舱的船底触礁灌进了水，有了这种设备，水就不会渗透到全船，轮船仍可以安全航行。船上装置的电动回声测深仪和电动计程仪都是自动化的，只要驾驶员一按电钮，就能自动测出正确的水深，航行了多少浬。
    这艘美丽的新型海轮，为旅客们布置了一个安全而舒适的旅行环境，船内有弹簧床垫的软席舱位，皮沙发的硬席舱位，连统舱也有睡铺，比通常的海轮要舒服得多。在船的中心位置设有妇婴室，因为这个地方颠簸最小。船的上层还有男女病人隔离室。为了充分保证旅客的安全，船上还为每个旅客准备了一套救生衣，还备有救生艇，救生筏，在紧急情况下，一、二分钟内就能把救生艇放下水。船上各层楼梯口都装有消防用的自动灭火器，到一定温度，灭火器开关就会自动开启。在船身的四周还装有强力的消防设备，它的喷射力可以达到船的各处，此外还有电气操纵的防空灯、火警指示器和应急发电机等安全设备。
