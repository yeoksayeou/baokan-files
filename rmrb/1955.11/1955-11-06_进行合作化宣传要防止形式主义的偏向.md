    Prevent Formalistic Tendencies in Cooperative Propaganda

    To the Editor:

    Recently, Xihe Township, Gaoyang County, Hebei Province, launched a propaganda campaign related to the agricultural cooperative movement. In the beginning, they organized drum teams to parade through the streets and alleys, and used mass meetings and broadcasts to talk about grand principles, making it a lively scene. However, after four or five days of propaganda, only a dozen farmers signed up to join the cooperative. Some cadres believed that after such a "grand and sensational" propaganda effort, the number of people signing up was still small, which showed that the masses were "ideologically backward." Some said: "If it really doesn't work, we'll go to their doors and beat drums!"

    The township general branch committee studied this situation and unanimously recognized that using drums and gongs for propaganda could not solve the ideological problems of the masses. According to everyone's analysis, because the township had not sufficiently promoted the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives in the past, some farmers were still afraid that the cooperative could not do a good job in production, and they could not make up their minds. Therefore, the general branch meticulously summarized the advantages of the agricultural cooperatives in the township, especially the vivid facts of the cooperative rescuing crops during this year's floods, and conducted in-depth propaganda to the farmers through group meetings and various forums. In this way, many individual farmers complained about the "bitterness of individual farming" at the meetings. Many people mentioned that when the big flood was approaching last year, the Qianjin Cooperative moved six mu of corn and four mu of millet home safely in one night; however, the individual farmer Kong Shan could not even get his harvested corn back in time, and if it weren't for the cooperative's boat saving him, he might have drowned. Farmer Zhao Lin recounted that his four mu of well-grown millet was flooded before his eyes, but not a single stalk of the cooperative's crops was lost. Through these facts, many farmers realized the superiority of agricultural cooperatives and actively requested to join.

    The situation of cooperative propaganda in Xihe Township shows that it is not enough to just create excitement when carrying out propaganda work, but it is necessary to use concrete facts to solve the ideological concerns of the farmers. It is suggested that rural party branches in various localities learn from this lesson and prevent formalistic tendencies in propaganda work.

### 进行合作化宣传要防止形式主义的偏向

    进行合作化宣传要防止形式主义的偏向编辑同志：
    河北省高阳县西河乡最近开展了有关农业合作化运动的宣传工作。在开始的时候，他们组织锣鼓队大街小巷到处游行，又用召开群众大会和广播的形式讲大道理，搞得真是热火朝天。但是，经过四、五天的宣传，只有十来户农民报名入社。有的干部认为进行了这样“大张旗鼓”的宣传，报名入社的还不多，这说明群众“思想落后”。有的说：“实在不行就到他们大门上敲鼓去！”
    乡总支委员会研究了这个情况，一致认识到用敲鼓打锣的办法进行宣传是不能解决群众的思想问题的。根据大家的分析，由于过去乡里对农业生产合作社的优越性宣传得不够，因此一部分农民群众还不敢相信社里准能把生产搞好，就拿不定主意。于是，总支详细地总结了本乡农业社的优越性，特别是拿出今年发大水的时候社里抢救庄稼的生动事实，利用分片会议和各种座谈会向农民群众进行了深入的宣传。这样，不少单干农民就在会上诉起“单干苦”来。很多人提到，去年大水快来的时候，前进社一晚上就把六亩玉米、四亩谷子平平安安地弄回家了；可是单干农民孔山呢已经摘下的玉米也来不及弄回来，要不是社里的船救了他，说不定连人也得淹死。农民赵林诉述了他的四亩长得好好的谷子，眼巴巴瞅着叫大水淹了，可是社里的庄稼连一个秸秆也没有丢。通过这些事实，很多农民认识了农业社的优越性，积极要求入社。
    西河乡进行合作化宣传的情况说明：在进行宣传工作的时候光搞热闹是不行的，而必须注意用具体事实来解决农民群众的思想顾虑。建议各地农村党支部接受这个教训，防止宣传工作中的形式主义的偏向。
