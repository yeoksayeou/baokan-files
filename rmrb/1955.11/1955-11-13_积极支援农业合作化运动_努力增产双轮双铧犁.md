Actively Support the Agricultural Cooperation Movement
Strive to Increase the Production of Double-Wheel Double-Share Plows
Editor Comrade:
　　After studying Comrade Mao Zedong's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" and the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Party, all the staff and workers of our Kaifeng Machinery Factory have been greatly encouraged. We are determined to produce more, better, and cheaper double-wheel double-share plows to support the great agricultural cooperation movement!

　　In these days, the staff and workers of our factory have displayed a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity, put forward rationalization proposals and promoted advanced experiences from all aspects, and a new atmosphere has emerged in production. Worker Zhang Changyou improved the riveting tool, increasing work efficiency from riveting 200 adjusting handles per day to 301. Technician Yang Ming of the assembly workshop improved the screw-tightening tool for correcting the plow beam, increasing work efficiency by more than double. The assembly workshop originally assembled 220 products per day, which increased to 270 per day after improving tools and adjusting labor organization. The third section of the forging workshop improved the mobile oven, which also greatly improved production efficiency. Thanks to the active efforts of all the staff and workers, our factory guarantees to complete this year's production plan 40 days ahead of schedule, and continue to increase the production of 10,000 double-wheel double-share plows. In addition, we must also prepare for next year's production.

　　With the advent of the high tide of the agricultural cooperation movement, the production task of our factory next year will be even more arduous. The output of double-wheel double-share plows will be doubled compared with this year, and the cost will be reduced by 40 percent. In order to strive to complete this glorious task, we need to make great efforts. At present, the weak links in our factory are incomplete materials, high tool wear rate, poor production management, unreasonable production organization, and so on. We have the confidence and determination to tackle these problems. We are now working hard to improve planning management and technical management, and further improve work efficiency and work quality, and strive to gradually achieve balanced and rhythmic production. In order to support the peasant brothers in taking the socialist road, improve production to improve life, and help the country's industrial construction, we must contribute all our strength.

　　积极支援农业合作化运动
　　努力增产双轮双铧犁编辑同志：
    我们开封机械厂全体职工学习了毛泽东同志“关于农业合作化问题”的报告和党中央六中全会的决议以后，受到了很大的鼓舞。我们决心生产更多、更好、更便宜的双轮双铧犁，来支援伟大的农业合作化运动！
    这些日子里，我们厂的职工发挥了高度的积极性和创造性，从各方面提出合理化建议和推广先进经验，生产上出现了一片新的气象。工人张长又改进了铆合工具，使工作效率从每天铆二百个调节把提高到铆三百零一个。装配车间技工杨明改进了校正犁梁的上螺丝工具，提高工作效率一倍多。装配车间原来每天装配二百二十部产品，经过改进工具和调整劳动组织以后，提高到每天装二百七十部。锻工车间第三工段改进了活动烘炉，也大大地提高了生产效率。由于全体职工的积极努力，我厂保证要提前四十天完成今年的生产计划，并且继续增产一万部双轮双铧犁。此外，我们还要为明年的生产做好准备工作。
    随着农业合作化运动高潮的到来，明年我厂的生产任务也更加艰巨了。双轮双铧犁的产量要比今年增加两倍，成本要降低百分之四十。为了争取完成这一个光荣的任务，就需要我们作很大的努力。目前，我们厂的薄弱环节是材料不齐，工具的损耗率大，生产管理不善，生产组织不合理等等。这些问题，我们都有信心和决心来抓紧解决。现在我们正在努力提高计划管理和技术管理工作，并且进一步提高工作效率和工作质量，争取逐步做到均衡地、有节奏地生产。为了支援农民弟兄走社会主义的道路，提高生产来改善生活和帮助国家的工业建设，我们一定要贡献出自己的全部力量。
