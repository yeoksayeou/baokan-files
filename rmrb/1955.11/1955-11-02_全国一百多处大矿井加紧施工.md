Xinhua News Agency, November 1st. More than half of the 168 coal mine mining units above the quota stipulated by the Ministry of Coal Industry in the First Five-Year Plan have been started. Together with the projects started before 1953, more than 100 mines above the quota are now under construction across the country.

　　Among these more than 100 mines, the coal bases originally in China - Fushun, Fuxin, Kailuan, Datong, and Huainan five major coal mines account for a large proportion of the mines under construction. In addition to the reconstruction of the existing mines in these five major coal mines in accordance with new technical directions, ten new mines are under construction, and four old mines are being restored. Among them, the Haizhou open-pit mine in Fuxin, the Laohutai mine in Fushun, and the Meiyukou mine in Datong have successively transferred some mining areas to production; the huge and technically complex Ping'an shaft in Fuxin and the No. 2 and No. 3 shafts in Xieji Set in Huainan have begun to install mechanical and electrical equipment; most of the remaining mines are in the stage of intense construction of roadways, and it is expected that they will be successively transferred to production before 1957. After all these mines are completed, the annual production capacity of these five coal mines will reach about 60% of the total production capacity of coal mines nationwide in 1952; the increased coal production will be enough to supply the fuel for 10 million kilowatts of thermal power equipment.

　　In addition to these five major coal mines, there are also dozens of pairs of mines under construction in Fengfeng in Hebei, Zibo and Taozhuang in Shandong, Hegang and Jixi in Northeast China, which are rich in coking coal and industrial coal, and Yangquan and Jiaozuo, which are civilian coal production areas. In the past, the Tongchuan coal mine in Shaanxi Province had very little coal production and the production method was very backward; now, in addition to the reconstruction of the original two mining areas, three pairs of modern new mines have been started. It is estimated that by 1957, the supply of industrial coal from the Tongchuan coal mine to the Northwest region will be several times higher than it is now.

　　In order to cooperate with the construction of the iron and steel industry and change the unbalanced distribution of coal industry regions in China, the new coal bases stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan have already begun construction. On the Pingdingshan new coalfield in Henan, not far from the Wuhan Iron and Steel Base, the first pair of mines started on September 8. There are also several pairs of mines under construction in Shiguai in Inner Mongolia and Zhongliangshan in Sichuan. In the next two years, many new mines will be built in these areas to supply industrial coal to nearby areas.

### 全国一百多处大矿井加紧施工

    全国一百多处大矿井加紧施工
    新华社一日讯　第一个五年计划中规定煤炭工业部建设的一百六十八个限额以上的煤矿采掘单位，已有一半以上动工兴建。加上一九五三年前开工的工程，现在全国共有一百多处限额以上的矿井正在加紧施工。
    在这一百多处矿井中，我国原有的煤炭基地——抚顺、阜新、开滦、大同和淮南五大煤矿正在建设的矿井占很大比重。这五大煤矿除了现有矿井都在按照新的技术方向进行改建以外，同时，有十处新矿井在动工兴建，有四处旧有矿井在恢复。其中，阜新海州露天矿、抚顺老虎台矿和大同煤峪口矿已有部分采区相继移交生产；规模巨大而技术复杂的阜新平安竖井和淮南谢家集二号、三号竖井，都已开始安装机电设备；其余矿井大部分处在井巷开拓的紧张施工阶段，预计在一九五七年前也都能先后移交生产。这些矿井全部建设完成后，这五个煤矿的年产能力，将达到一九五二年全国煤矿全部生产能力的百分之六十左右；增加的煤产量足可供应一千万瓩的火力发电设备燃用。
    除了这五大煤矿以外，在盛产炼焦煤和工业用煤的河北的峰峰，山东的淄博、陶庄，东北的鹤岗、鸡西和民用煤产地阳泉、焦作等煤矿，也都有几十对矿井正在施工。陕西省的铜川煤矿过去煤产量很少，生产方法也很落后；现在除原有的两个矿区正在改建外，并有三对现代化的新矿井已经动工建设。预计到一九五七年，铜川煤矿供应西北地区的工业用煤将比现在增加好几倍。
    为了配合钢铁工业的建设和改变我国原有煤炭工业地区分布不平衡的状况，第一个五年计划规定的新的煤炭基地，有的已经开始建设。在离武汉钢铁基地不远的河南平顶山新煤田上，第一对矿井已在九月八日动工。内蒙古的石拐子和四川的中梁山等地，也有几对矿井正在施工。这些地区在今后两年内还将陆续建设许多新的矿井，以供应附近地区的工业用煤。
