Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 26th – Indonesian President Sukarno delivered a speech at a mass rally held in Purwokerto, Central Java, on the 24th. He emphatically pointed out the importance of national unity in the face of the grave danger of imperialist conspiracies against Indonesia. He said: "Unity supported only by nationalists and religious people is incomplete. Marxists must also be invited to participate in unity."

Sukarno said that some politicians and newspapers were trying to stop him from speaking at public gatherings. Sukarno asked the audience: "Do you all agree that I should remain silent and never speak to you again?" Hundreds of thousands of people replied: "No!" Sukarno said that wherever he goes, thousands, sometimes even more than a million people, ask him to give a speech. He said: "The people want me to speak because Sukarno can express the people's thoughts and feelings. So the people do not want Sukarno to be silent."

Sukarno is currently continuing his travels in Central Java, calling for the realization of national unity to deal with imperialist conspiracies. The people welcomed him with great enthusiasm. According to newspaper reports, during Sukarno's current trip, approximately five million people throughout Central Java have heard his speeches.

The Indonesian "People's Daily" published an editorial on the 26th, expressing support for President Sukarno. The editorial said: "As long as colonialism still threatens our country's independence and sovereignty, we need a president who is also a national leader. This explains why the Indonesian Communist Party first suggested that the future Constituent Assembly re-elect Sukarno as president."

The "People's Daily" pointed out that a common thread runs through President Sukarno's recent speeches. That is to call on the people to be faithful to the 1945 Declaration of Independence, faithful to the Republic of the Declaration of Independence.

The "People's Daily" said that some people are trying to push President Sukarno into the background. All these attempts are against the interests of Indonesian independence.

The "Indonesian Torch" also said on the 25th that the president should not be made a puppet leader. He should speak not only as the president stipulated by the constitution, but also as the leader of the people.

　　苏加诺发表演说强调民族团结的重要性
    据新华社雅加达二十六日电　印度尼西亚总统苏加诺二十四日在中爪哇普禾加多举行的一个群众集会上发表演说。他强调指出了在帝国主义对印度尼西亚进行阴谋的严重危险面前民族团结的重要性。他说：“仅由民族主义者和信仰宗教的人们支持的团结是不完善的。必须也邀请马克思主义者参加团结。”
    苏加诺说，有些政客和报纸企图制止他在公众集会上讲话。苏加诺问听众说：“你们是不是都同意我保持缄默而永远不再向你们讲话？”成千上万的人回答说：“不同意。”苏加诺说，不论他到什么地方，数以千计的人，有时候甚至百万以上的人都要求他发表演说。他说：“人民要我讲话，因为苏加诺能够表达人民的想法和心情。所以人民并不要苏加诺缄默。”
    苏加诺目前正继续在中爪哇旅行，号召实现民族团结以对付帝国主义的阴谋。人民怀着极大的热情欢迎他。据报纸报道，在苏加诺目前旅行期间，在中爪哇各地已经约有五百万人听过他的演说。
    印度尼西亚“人民日报”二十六日发表社论，表示支持苏加诺总统。社论说：“只要是殖民主义仍然威胁着我国的独立和主权，我们就需要一个同时又是民族领袖的总统。这就说明为什么印度尼西亚共产党首先建议将来制宪议会重新选举苏加诺为总统”。
    “人民日报”指出，一条线贯穿着苏加诺总统最近的几次演说。那就是号召人民忠实于一九四五年的独立宣言，忠实于独立宣言共和国。
      “人民日报”说，有人企图把苏加诺总统推到后台。这一切企图都是违反印度尼西亚独立的利益的。
      “印度尼西亚火炬报”也在二十五日说，不应该使总统成为一个傀儡领袖。他不仅应该作为宪法规定的总统讲话，而且应该作为人民的领袖讲话。
