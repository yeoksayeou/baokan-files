Liaoning Province's Shenyang, Anshan, Dalian and other ten cities have recently approved the transfer of more than 40,000 urban surplus laborers to wasteland reclamation areas such as Panshan, Yingkou, and Heishan to cultivate virgin land. The Provincial People's Committee has preliminarily surveyed more than 30,000 hectares of fertile, flat, virgin land suitable for mechanized large-scale reclamation for these people. More than fifty advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives will soon be established on these virgin lands.

Currently, the Provincial People's Committee has allocated a batch of agricultural machinery and provided a large number of new-style animal-drawn farm implements and fertilizers to meet the needs of wasteland reclamation. The Dalian immigration team has begun construction work in the Yingkou, Changtu and other reclamation areas. The Jinzhou reclamation team has built new houses in the Heishan reclamation area.

　  辽宁组织城市剩余劳力开荒
    辽宁省沈阳、鞍山、旅大等十个城市，最近已批准了四万多名城市剩余劳动力到盘山、营口、黑山等垦荒地区开垦生荒地。省人民委员会已为垦荒的人们初步勘测了三万多公顷土质肥沃、地势平坦、适宜于机械化大规模开垦的生荒地。不久将在这些生荒地上成立五十多个高级农业生产合作社。
    目前省人民委员会已调拨了一批农业机器，贷放了大批的新式畜力农具、肥料等供应开荒需要。旅大市的移民队已在营口、昌图等垦荒区开始进行建设工作。锦州市的垦荒队已在黑山垦荒区建筑了新的住宅。　（杨子江）
