Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company has decided to commence sixteen projects originally scheduled to begin construction next year in November and December of this year. The workload of these projects is approximately 10% of Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company's engineering plan for the first quarter of next year.

Many of these projects that are starting ahead of schedule are key projects for Anshan next year. These include China's sixth modern blast furnace—Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 3 Blast Furnace, the second phase of the Dagushan Magnetic Separation Plant, the Dagushan Crushing and Screening Yard, and the new Sintering Plant project. The removal of the dust collector and gas pipeline of the No. 3 Blast Furnace, which was originally planned to begin in the first quarter of next year, has now been decided to start in November of this year, striving for completion within the year. The earthwork and concrete work for the filter workshop, wet concentrate tank, and concentration pond of the second phase of the Dagushan Magnetic Separation Plant, which were also originally planned to start next year, have now had their entire construction period moved forward and will begin excavation and pouring in November of this year.

　　鞍钢建设公司十六项工程提前施工
    鞍山钢铁建设公司决定把十六项原计划在明年开始施工的工程，提前在今年十一、十二月份中动工。这些工程的工作量，约等于鞍钢建设公司明年第一季度工程计划的百分之十左右。
    这些提前动工的工程，不少都是鞍山明年的重点工程。其中包括我国第六座近代化炼铁炉——鞍钢三号炼铁炉、大孤山磁选厂二期工程、大孤山破碎筛分场和新烧结厂工程等。三号炼铁炉的除尘器和瓦斯管道拆除，本来计划明年第一季度开始，现在决定提前在今年十一月份动工，争取在年内完成。大孤山磁选厂二期工程的过滤车间、湿精矿槽、浓缩池的土方和混凝土工程，原来也计划在明年动工，现在把整个工期提前，在今年十一月份中就开始挖土和浇灌。
