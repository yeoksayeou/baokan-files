The Struggle of the Spanish People Continues
Spain　A'er Gelade

　　Spain and China are two countries very far apart, one might even say extremely far apart. But whenever I look at a world map, I see that the 40th parallel north seems like a communication line connecting our two countries.

　　However, the people of different countries are not connected by meridians or parallels, but by the struggle for freedom.

　　In 1936, in order to defend their legitimate rights, the Spanish people waged a revolutionary war against the feudal and reactionary classes who, with the help of foreign forces, attempted to strangle the victory of democracy. At this time, the Spanish people and the people of all countries became closer to each other through emotional resonance.

　　The communication between the people of different countries, although all emotional resonance, is different due to different environments and different developments of each nation. The struggle of the people of one country arouses sympathy in the people of other countries, and when this struggle becomes a model for the struggle of the people of another country, this sympathy will be increased a hundredfold, and it will become an encouragement, support, and driving force.

　　During my visit to China, I saw concrete proof of this situation: a photograph taken in Yan'an in 1937. In the photo, there is a building with a slogan "Salute to the Heroic Spanish People" written on the door in unskilled handwriting, and "Learn from the Spanish People" written on the wall in charcoal.

　　The place photographed in this photo must be the entrance to a conference, which was paying tribute to the resistance in Madrid and the heroism of the Spanish people, and at the same time, to encourage the Chinese people to carry out their own struggle against the Japanese invaders. When I visited various parts of China, people repeatedly mentioned and related the struggles carried out by the Chinese and Spanish people in those years. Although the enemies of our two countries had different names at that time, they had many similarities in methods, ideas, and ambitions. The Berlin-Rome-Tokyo fascist axis attempted to conquer the people of our two countries first, and then conquer the people of other countries.

　　Unfortunately, I can no longer continue this comparison. Since then, the historical development of our two countries has taken different paths: the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, struggled and achieved victory, while the Spanish people suffered a temporary setback at that time, and are still struggling to win victory and freedom.

　　Comrade Dolores Ibárruri, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Spain, once said: Our revolutionary war from 1936 to 1939 was an "glorious epic of the Spanish people defending democratic freedom, national independence, and national sovereignty."

　　The Spanish reactionaries themselves did not have the power to overthrow the Spanish democratic regime. They turned to Hitler's Germany and fascist Italy for help. These two countries immediately saw that controlling Spain would be a strategic victory in their plan to conquer the world. In the temporary defeat of the Spanish people, the reactionary forces of the world all participated in the dirty business with their already very dirty hands. Some participated directly, while others disguised their participation, like those so-called "democratic" countries: Britain, France, and the United States, which were alarmed to see that the Spanish Republic would develop into a truly democratic country.

　　After the war, Spain began to encounter severe suffering, encountering the bloodiest terror rule in our history. The Franco regime massacred thousands of workers, peasants, and democratic intellectuals; prisons and concentration camps were filled with people, trade union organizations were destroyed, and the activities of progressive parties were banned. They ruled Spain with the power of the secret police, relying economically on financial oligarchs, large landowners, and the church, and politically through the fascist "Falange."

　　The defeat of Hitler's Germany was a severe blow to Franco and his government. Franco turned to the United States. Franco and his government won victory by relying on foreign aid, and could not continue to exist without this aid. Spanish landlords, bankers, and monopoly capitalists are now closely linked with American capitalists. The Franco group is the tool of these people.

　　The Franco group has brought deep disasters to Spain, and the working class, peasants, intellectuals, and petty bourgeoisie bear the brunt. That is to say, in addition to bringing terror, repression, obscurantism, and deprivation of civil rights, it also brought extreme hunger and poverty.

　　According to the statistics of 1953, the production of steel had not yet recovered to the level of 1929, and the mining of iron ore was 46.5 percent lower than in 1929. The production of cotton yarn was 59 percent lower than before 1936.

　　From 1939 to 1952, the average annual output of agricultural products was 79.9 percent of the average annual output between 1932 and 1935. From 1932 to 1935, each Spaniard had an average of 100 kilograms of agricultural products; while in 1953, the average was only 62 kilograms.

　　Today, the living standard of the Spanish people is one of the lowest in Europe. Workers' wages are three or four times worse than in 1935. Women's wages are 30 percent lower than men's. The exploitation of child labor is carried out in jobs that child labor cannot bear. In a country like Spain, with a population of about 28 million, there are 3 million unemployed agricultural workers. The salaries of teachers, professors, and civil servants are pitifully low. In order to maintain their lives, they have to find side jobs. Small industrial and commercial businesses cannot survive and eventually go bankrupt.

　　On the other hand, the profits of banks, companies, and monopolies under the financial oligarchs have increased, and are increasing faster every year.

　　After the failure of the democratic forces in Spain—naturally, this failure was a painful blow—the Socialist Party, the Anarchist Party, and other parties of the Republic felt pessimistic and hopeless, lacking confidence in the future, and thought that it would be impossible for Spain to achieve democracy again for at least fifty years. Only the Communist Party has always believed that the Franco government is a regime of terror and bloodshed, that this regime is unstable and unsustainable. The Communist Party reorganized itself, overcame the consequences of the disintegration caused by inevitable circumstances at the beginning, and began to erect the banner of resistance in the interior of Spain.

　　The enemy used all kinds of means, from provocation to murder, from sending secret agents into our party to using tanks to attack guerrillas; but it is clear that they have not been able to defeat our party, nor have they been able to contain the struggle of the people. On the contrary, the party has become stronger in the struggle. Due to the leadership of the party, this struggle is developing more and more and becoming more and more effective. The party organized the scattered guerrillas in the mountains, published underground publications—at least twenty underground newspapers throughout the country—organized the party's branches and leadership organizations in various places, and in May 1947, the party was able to lead a general strike in the industrial and mining areas of Ouzga.

　　During this difficult period of struggle from 1940 to 1948, many heroes of the struggle emerged within the party, such as Cristino García, Rosa Vía, Laranaga, and countless other heroes. Whether they were martyred in prison or sacrificed on the battlefield, they are the glory of our party and the Spanish people. Such struggles strengthened our resistance movement and rescued millions of peasants who maintained contact with the guerrillas from the reactionary forces, and also made the people realize that it is possible to fight against the Franco regime.

　　But from the party's point of view, the party was still fighting alone at that time, thinking that with its efforts and heroic actions, it would be able to unite everyone in this struggle. It ignored that if the masses were not mobilized in the struggle, no matter how heroic the efforts were, they would not be enough.

　　Then the next period of struggle began, the party struggled to organize the masses, to work among the masses, and to work in the masses' own organizations. At this time, the Franco regime established their "straight-line trade union" organization, which is a fascist trade union. In the various industries of the trade union, the upper and lower levels are mixed together, and workers and factory owners, the exploited and the exploiters, coexist in one trade union, and participation in the trade union is compulsory. The party's new line is to work in these trade unions, and the party sends people to work in any mass organization, whatever its nature. The important achievement of this policy was the creation of the Barcelona general strike in 1951, which shook the Franco regime.

　　The sharp economic crisis, the masses' dissatisfaction with the Franco regime, and the anxiety caused by Franco's following the American war policy, all these factors united the Spanish cities to create a huge protest movement; especially in Barcelona, ​​the climax created here was a week-long general strike. There was a moment when the strikers occupied the city, and the forces of suppression could not resist the progress of the masses. Franco and his government panicked and had to send troops and fleets to reinforce and contain the movement. This strike was a victory of unity.

　　Dolores Ibárruri has repeatedly stated on several occasions that the Barcelona general strike was the beginning of a new period in the Spanish people's struggle. This argument has been proven in practice.

　　Since then, the crisis of the Franco regime has entered a period of intensification. The sentiment against the Franco regime, which had been more or less hidden due to the policy of terror, has now become clearly manifested. The Barcelona general strike aroused widespread sympathy among the people, so that under their pressure and under the pressure of the international movement, Franco had to release the strike leader Gregorio López Raimundo, otherwise Raimundo would most likely have been shot like many others in previous years. There is more than one case like Raimundo.

　　The widespread and unanimous rejection of the Franco regime has led to the disintegration of the political unity of this regime. Franco's fascist party, the Falange, now hardly exists. People's feelings of disgust for this party are so strong that even some old Falangists feel that it is indecent to walk on the street with the symbols and badges of the Falange. The Spanish bourgeoisie saw the precarious situation of Franco and felt panic, and they began to look for a way out in order to preserve their interests. Therefore, various "opposition" parties have emerged within this regime, such as the monarchists, traditionalists, and those who attempt to form a Catholic Action Party like Italy.

　　In September 1953, Franco signed an agreement with the United States, opening the door of Spain to American imperialism, making Spain's resources, transportation, naval and air bases, and armed forces completely serve American imperialism, in fact turning Spain into a strategic base and colony in the American aggression plan.

　　Franco thought that signing this agreement would improve his situation, but this agreement only deepened the contradictions in Spanish society and aroused the patriotic feelings of the Spanish people. Faced with the fact that Spain was sold to foreign countries, faced with a new aggression and the fact that Spain was turned into a tool of war, the people's sentiment for independence and peace greatly increased. This will greatly encourage the Communist Party's proposal to form a national anti-Franco front.

　　Last year, the Communist Party of Spain held its Fifth National Congress. This congress was of great significance, not only because it can be seen the current situation of the struggle against the Franco regime, but also because it can be seen the future Spanish democratic regime. One of the main tasks of the Fifth National Congress was to adopt a democratic program, which, as Dolores Ibárruri said, could "unite all anti-Franco regime forces and become a banner and program of a democratic Spain."

　　One of the weaknesses of the Spanish democratic movement is the lack of unity. In various periods, the struggle for unity has been an important task of the Communist Party of Spain. Since the publication of this program, a big step has been taken towards unity, and unity is the prerequisite for victory.

　　The Spanish people have always opposed the bloody dictatorship of the Franco regime imposed on them. In these years, the Spanish people have never stopped their struggle against the Franco regime, sometimes small-scale actions that appear every day, sometimes large-scale actions by the masses, and sometimes actions such as general strikes in Barcelona, ​​Madrid, Pamplona, ​​Bilbao, and other places. Today, the Franco regime is extremely unpopular, and the people's sentiment of abandoning it is so universal that the bourgeoisie is seriously considering the issue of replacement. Their existing solution is the monarchy, and if possible, retain Franco, and if not possible, then do without Franco.

　　They want to realize such changes in the upper levels of the government behind the backs of the people, without relying on the people, and deceiving the people. But a change of appearance cannot deceive the Spanish people, who have political experience and a tradition of struggle.

　　The economic crisis is deepening, dissatisfaction is growing, protest actions are increasing, the party's influence among the masses is rising, and the ideas of striving for peace and democracy are winning over more and more people in all social strata. The current task is to form a national anti-Franco front that unites the people of the whole country to carry out the struggle.

　　In the struggle for unity, the increasing influence and prestige of the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union's continuous struggle for the cause of defending peace, and the achievements of the new democratic countries have all played a huge role. Not to mention, the great achievements made by the new China after being liberated from the hands of foreign imperialism and those who have always spared no effort to serve imperialism—people like Franco—have also played a huge role.

　　In 1937, the walls of the venue of the anti-Japanese aggression conference held in Yan'an were written with "Learn from the Spanish People." I believe that today in Spain, underground conferences against American aggression are also being held, if not open gatherings—because open gatherings are impossible. I also believe that in some of the walls of the venues where such conferences are held, such words can be seen: "Learn from the Chinese People."

　　Yes, in the struggle for peace, independence, and democracy, the Chinese people are an example and a most valuable support for the Spanish people.

    西班牙人民的斗争在继续
    西班牙　阿尔格拉德
    西班牙和中国是两个彼此距离很远的国家，甚至可以说远到极点。但是每当我注视一幅世界地图的时候，我看到北纬四十度就好像一条彼此可以通话的交通线一样，把我们两个国家联在一起。
    然而，各国人民之间不是用经线或纬线来彼此联系，而是通过争取自由的斗争来互通声息的。
    一九三六年，西班牙人民为了保卫自己的正当权利，向借助于外国势力企图扼杀民主胜利的封建和反动阶级，进行了革命战争。在这个时候，西班牙人民和世界各国人民，通过心情上的共鸣，彼此更加接近。
    各国人民之间的互通声息，虽然都是心情上的共鸣，但由于不同的环境和各民族自己不同的发展，却各自有所不同。一国人民的斗争在其他国家的人民中引起同情，而当这个斗争成为另一国人民的斗争典范的时候，这种同情就会百倍增强，就变成为一种鼓舞、支援和原动力。
    在我访问中国的期间，我就看到了这种情况的具体证明：这是一幅一九三七年在延安拍摄的照片。照片上有一所建筑物，在门上有一张笔法还不很纯熟的“向英勇的西班牙人民致敬”的标语，墙上有炭笔写的“向西班牙人民学习”。
    这幅照片上所照的一定是一个大会进门的地方，这个大会是在向马德里的抗敌和西班牙人民的英勇致敬，同时，也是为了鼓舞中国人民进行自己的反对日本侵略者的斗争。当我在中国各地访问的时候，人们多次向我提起并联系当年中、西两国人民所进行的斗争，当时我们两国人民的敌人虽然名称不同，但他们在方法、思想和野心上都是有很多相同之点的。柏林—罗马—东京的法西斯轴心企图首先征服我们两国人民，然后再征服其他各国人民。
    不幸的是，我不能再继续这个对比。从那个时候起，我们两国人民的历史发展就走上了不同的道路：中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，进行斗争并取得了胜利，西班牙人民当时遭受到暂时的挫折，现在仍在为争取胜利和争取自由而进行斗争。
    西班牙共产党总书记多洛雷斯·伊巴露丽同志曾说：我们一九三六年至一九三九年的革命战争是一首“西班牙人民保卫民主自由、民族独立和民族主权的光荣史诗”。
    西班牙反动派自己并没有力量来推翻西班牙的民主政权。他们求助于希特勒德国和法西斯意大利。这两个国家立刻就看到控制西班牙将是它们征服世界计划的一个战略性的胜利。在西班牙人民暂时的失败中，全世界的反动势力都曾用它们已经非常肮脏的双手参加了肮脏的勾当。有些直接地参与，另一些比较掩饰着它们的参与行为，像那些所谓“民主”国家：英国、法国、美国，它们看到西班牙共和国会发展成为一个真正的民主国家而感到惊慌。
    战争结束以后，西班牙开始遭遇到严重的苦难，遭遇到我们有史以来最血腥的恐怖统治。佛朗哥政权残杀了数以千计的工人、农民和民主的知识分子；监狱和集中营里关满了人，摧毁了工会组织，禁止进步党派活动。他们用秘密警察的力量，在经济上依靠金融寡头、大地主和教会，在政治上通过法西斯的“长枪党”，来统治西班牙。
    希特勒德国的失败对佛朗哥和他的政府来说，是一个很严重的打击。佛朗哥转向了美国。佛朗哥和他的政府依靠外国的援助取得了胜利，而且没有这种援助就不能继续存在。西班牙大地主、银行家和垄断资本家今天都和美国资本家密切联在一起。佛朗哥集团就是这些人的工具。
    佛朗哥集团给西班牙带来了深重的灾难，而首当其冲的就是工人阶级、农民、知识分子和小资产阶级。这就是说除了带来了恐怖、镇压、愚民政策和剥夺公民权利之外，还带来了极端的饥饿和贫困。
    根据一九五三年的统计，钢的产量还没有恢复到一九二九年的水平，铁的开采量比一九二九年降低了百分之四十六点五。棉纱的产量比一九三六年以前降低了百分之五十九。
    从一九三九到一九五二年间，农产品每年的平均产量为一九三二年到一九三五年间每年平均产量的百分之七十九点九。从一九三二年到一九三五年这几年中，平均每个西班牙人有一百公斤的农产品；而在一九五三年时，平均只有六十二公斤。
    今天西班牙人民的生活水平是欧洲最低的水平之一。工人的工资比起一九三五年来要差三、四倍。妇女的工资比男工的工资还要低百分之三十。对于童工的剥削，是在童工能力所担负不了的工作中进行的。像在西班牙这样一个人口大约二千八百万的国家中，就有三百万的农业工人失业。教师、教授、公职人员的薪资少得可怜，为了要维持生活，他们不得不找些副业来做。小型的工商业不能维持，最后都走向破产。
    另一方面，金融寡头属下的银行、公司、垄断企业所得的利润却增加了，而且一年比一年增加得快。
    西班牙的民主力量失败之后——自然，这失败是一个沉痛的打击——共和国的社会党、无政府党等党派都感到悲观失望，对前途缺乏信心，以为至少在五十年中西班牙不可能再实现民主。只有共产党始终认定佛朗哥政府是一个恐怖与血腥的政权，这个政权是不稳定的，是不能持久的。共产党重整旗鼓，克服了当初由于不可避免的情况而造成的解体的后果，开始在西班牙内地竖起了抵抗的旗帜。
    敌人使用了各种手段，从挑衅到谋杀，从派遣特务分子到我们的党内来到使用坦克车去攻打游击队；但是很明显，他们并没有能击败我们的党，也没有能遏止人民的斗争。恰恰相反，党在斗争中锻炼得更坚强。由于党的领导，这种斗争日益开展，而且收效日益宏大。党在山区之间把分散的游击队组织起来了，出版地下刊物——在全国各地至少有二十种地下报纸——，把党各地的支部及领导机构都组织了起来，一九四七年五月党就能够在欧乌兹加底的工矿地区领导了一次总罢工。
    在一九四○年至一九四八年这段困难的斗争时期里，党内涌现了许多斗争英雄，如克里斯蒂诺·加西亚、罗萨·比亚、拉兰尼亚加以及许许多多数不尽的英雄。不论他们是在监狱中就义或是在战场上牺牲，他们都是我们的党和西班牙人民的荣耀。这样的斗争加强了我们的抵抗运动，并从反动势力下把千百万与游击队保持联系的农民拯救出来，同时也使人民认识到，同佛朗哥政权作斗争是可能的。
    但是从党这方面来说，党当时还在孤军作战，认为以它的努力与英勇行为将能把所有的人都团结到这场斗争里来，它忽略掉如果在斗争中不动员群众，无论作怎样的英勇努力，也都是不够的。
    接着下一个斗争时期就开始了，党为组织群众而斗争，到群众中去工作，到群众自己的组织中去工作。这时佛朗哥政权建立了他们“直线工会”的组织，这是法西斯性质的工会，在工会的各种产业中，上下层都混在一起，工人与厂主，被剥削者与剥削者都并存在一个工会中，参加工会是强制性的。党的新路线就是在这些工会中去工作，无论什么性质的群众组织，党都派人去工作。这个政策的重要成就是造成了一九五一年巴塞罗那的大罢工，这次罢工曾使佛朗哥政权为之动摇。
    尖锐的经济危机，群众对佛朗哥政权的不满，以及由于佛朗哥追随美国战争政策而引起的焦虑不安，这一切因素使西班牙各城市团结起来造成一次巨大的抗议运动；特别是在巴塞罗那，在这里所造成的高潮是为期一星期之久的大罢工。曾经有一个时刻罢工者占领了这个城市，镇压的力量抵挡不住群众的进展。佛朗哥和他的政府惊惶失措，不得不派兵和舰队前来增援，以遏止这个运动。这次罢工是团结的胜利。
    多洛雷斯·伊巴露丽曾在若干场合中一再说明，巴塞罗那的大罢工是西班牙人民斗争的一个新时期的开始。这个论点在实践中已经得到了证明。
    从那个时候起，佛朗哥政权的危机进入了尖锐化的时期。反对佛朗哥政权的情绪，过去由于恐怖政策的缘故，或多或少是隐蔽着的，这时却已经明显地表现出来了。巴塞罗那的大罢工引起了人民广泛的同情，以致在他们的压力之下以及在国际运动的压力之下，佛朗哥不得不释放罢工的领袖格利戈里奥·罗培兹·雷蒙多，否则雷蒙多是很可能就像前数年许多其他的人一样被枪杀的。像雷蒙多的例子不只一个。　　广泛而一致地对佛朗哥政权表示唾弃的情绪，使得这个政权的政治团结瓦解了。佛朗哥的法西斯政党长枪党现在几乎不存在了。人们对这个政党深痛恶绝的情绪是如此的强烈，甚至一些老长枪党员也觉得戴着长枪党的符号和证章到街上去走是一件不体面的事。西班牙的资产阶级看到佛朗哥朝不保夕的情况而感到惊惶，他们开始在找一条出路以便保全他们的利益。因此，在这个政权之内就出现了各种“反对”的党派，如像保皇派、传统派和企图组成一个像意大利那样的天主教行动党。
    一九五三年九月，佛朗哥与美国签订了一个协定，为美国帝国主义打开了西班牙的大门，使西班牙的资源、交通、海空军基地、武装力量完全替美国帝国主义服务，事实上是把西班牙变成美国侵略计划中的战略基地和殖民地。
    佛朗哥以为签订这个协定可以改善他的处境，但是这个协定只是加深西班牙社会的矛盾和激起西班牙人民的爱国情绪。面对着把西班牙这个国家出卖给外国这个事实，面对着一次新的侵略和使西班牙成为战争工具这一事实，人民争取独立与和平的情绪大大高涨起来。这对于共产党所倡议的组成全国反佛朗哥的阵线将起很大的鼓舞作用。
    去年西班牙共产党召开了第五次代表大会。这次大会具有重大的意义，不仅由于可以看出目前反对佛朗哥政权斗争的情况，而且也因为可以看出未来的西班牙民主政体。第五次代表大会的主要任务之一就是通过一个民主纲领，这个纲领，正如多洛雷斯·伊巴露丽所说的，可以“团结一切反佛朗哥政权的力量，可以成为一个民主西班牙的旗帜和纲领”。
    西班牙民主运动的弱点之一就是缺乏团结。在各个不同的时期中，为团结而进行的斗争是西班牙共产党的重要任务。自从这个纲领公布之后，就向团结跨进了一大步，团结正是胜利的前提。
    西班牙人民一直反对强加在他们身上的佛朗哥政权的血腥独裁。在这些年代中，西班牙人民没有片刻停止他们反对佛朗哥政权的斗争，有时是每日出现的小规模行动，有时是群众的大规模行动，有时是像巴塞罗那、马德里、判普罗那、毕尔巴鄂等地方的大罢工那样的行动。今天佛朗哥政权已十分不得人心，人民弃绝它的情绪已十分普遍，以致使资产阶级要认真考虑代替人的问题了。他们现有的解决办法是君主政体，如果可能的话，就保留佛朗哥，不可能的话，就不要佛朗哥。
    他们想背着人民，就在政府的上层实现这样的变革，不依靠人民，并欺骗人民。但是改头换面是欺骗不了西班牙人民的，西班牙的人民是有政治经验和斗争的传统的。
    经济危机日益加深，不满的情绪日益增长，抗议的行动也愈见增多，党在群众中的影响日渐高涨，争取和平与民主的思想在社会各阶层中争取到日益增多的人数。现在的任务就是组成团结全国人民来进行斗争的反佛朗哥的全国阵线。
    在争取团结的斗争中，苏联日益增长的影响和威望，苏联的不断为保卫和平事业所进行的斗争，新民主主义国家的成就，都起了巨大的作用。更不用说，新中国在从外国帝国主义和一向为帝国主义服务不遗余力的人——像佛朗哥一样的人——的手中解放之后所取得的伟大成就，也都起了巨大的作用。
    一九三七年在延安举行反对日本侵略大会会场墙壁上写着“向西班牙人民学习”。我相信今天在西班牙也在举行反对美国侵略的地下大会，如果不是公开集会的话——因为公开的集会是不可能的。我也相信，在举行这种大会的会场中，某些墙壁上也可以见到这样的话：“向中国人民学习。”
    是的，西班牙人民在争取和平、独立与民主的斗争中，中国人民是一个范例，是一个最可贵的支援。　　　　　　（本报特约稿）
