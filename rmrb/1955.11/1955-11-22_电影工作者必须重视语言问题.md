　　Filmmakers Must Pay Attention to Language Issues
　　Sun Qian
    Film is the art form closest to the masses. In 1954, the number of film viewers reached over 820 million; that is to say, more than two million viewers are influenced by film language every day.

    Promoting the standardization of modern Chinese and popularizing Mandarin Chinese is the political task of the Han people. Faced with such a glorious task, film artists should seriously examine the shortcomings in the use of language in films.

    The requirement of using language that is rich and varied, clear and vivid, with imagery and personality is a common feature of all literary arts, and film is no exception. However, film has limitations on the length of the film reel, so the language it uses must be more refined, more precise, and more expressive. This is a very basic principle. Unfortunately, our film artists have not paid enough attention to it in the past. Films are made based on literary scripts, but our film writers (including myself, of course) are not good at processing and refining everyday language into literary language; therefore, the language used in our films appears bloated, verbose, lengthy, dull, and old-fashioned.

    The phenomena of poverty and dryness in film language is an old problem for us, but we have not yet found a way to break through this barrier. The lines in some films have no imagery or personality. Even if the dialogue between two or even more characters is swapped, it will not hinder the progress of the plot. Three films feature factory Party committee secretaries, and the lines of the three characters are almost identical. If the actors playing these three factory Party committee secretaries were to switch roles in the middle of filming, the three films could still be shot as is – conceptualized language cannot fully express the thoughts and feelings of characters, cannot express their personalities, and therefore cannot arouse the audience's interest in appreciating the art of language.

    In order to break through the embarrassing situation of language poverty, some film writers (including myself) have taken another detour: using the easiest naturalistic method, abusing idioms, proverbs, allegorical sayings, and ambiguous or ungrammatical words, resulting in impure and chaotic language.

    Idioms, proverbs, and allegorical sayings have a common characteristic: they are rhythmic, visual, lively, and expressive. They can be appropriately used according to the needs of the characters' personalities. However, there are also many dross that are mixed, outdated, and no longer have life, so we must avoid overuse. We have such a film in which all the characters can speak allegorical sayings, and the entire village of farmers has become experts in allegorical sayings. There is no such phenomenon in life, and this is overuse.

    Since liberation, the lives of the masses have changed, and therefore the language of the masses has also changed – some new language vocabulary is circulating and growing among the masses. We cannot and should not bring the grammatical errors generated by the masses in the process of learning new vocabulary into the film without correction. Unfortunately, we can often hear such lines in our films: "没有文化水儿" (méiyǒu wénhuà shuǐr) (meaning "low level of education"), "挨了一批" (āi le yī pī) (meaning "received criticism"), "奔社会儿" (bēn shèhuìr) (taking the socialist road), etc. – the consequences of this kind of novelty-seeking "creation" of language, besides destroying our pure language, is of no benefit.

    Generally speaking, film does not completely reject the appropriate use of dialects. Dialects can enrich our Mandarin and add to the local color of film stories. However, the principle of using dialects is that they must be understandable and clear to the average audience. We do not advocate saying "蹲下" (dūn xià, squat down) as "趷蹴下" (kē cù xià), nor do we advocate saying "老都老了" (lǎo dōu lǎo le, already old) as "老都老球了" (lǎo dōu lǎo qiú le), and we certainly do not advocate forcing the audience to experience those obscure and strange "local flavors."

    Film language expresses the characters' personalities. A small number of film artists once had an extremely wrong view: that to express the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers, one must use dirty words – cursing mothers and fathers. Facts have proved that dirty words can only pollute our language. Our films are tools for educating new people, and we must resolutely abandon those vulgar and dirty words, and we must never allow those unbearable languages to continue to appear in the soundtracks of our films!

    Writers are the creators of language, not the destroyers of language. Film writers have a responsibility to create beautiful and moving film language.

    Film actors (including dubbing actors) are the direct communicators of literary language. In the movement to promote Mandarin, film actors have a particularly important task – more than two million people listen to them speak and learn Mandarin with them every day. Film actors must learn to speak Mandarin, and they must speak it purely and standardly. However, some of our film actors still do not have standard pronunciations. Often in a film, various pronunciations will appear in the same family. Some are because they cannot speak Beijing accent and use local accents, and some can use Beijing accent but deliberately use local accents. Even now, there are still a very small number of film actors who are obsessed with local accents and dialects. They say that using local accents can arouse "creative emotions" and "highlight the characters' personalities." We believe that this is an incorrect creative method. The Zhuge Liang in Peking opera does not speak Jiaodong dialect, and Lin Daiyu in "Dream of the Red Chamber" does not speak Jiangnan dialect, but their personalities are so vivid and distinct!

    In fact, we have suffered and learned our lesson on the issue of pronunciation. The "Northern Shaanxi Pastoral Song" shot in Northern Shaanxi dialect had to be completely re-recorded in Mandarin because the audience could not understand it; "Spring Breeze Blows to the Nuomin River" is a film depicting agricultural cooperativization, but farmers inside the pass could not fully understand the Northeast dialect, thus weakening the educational effect of the film; "Company Commander Guan" was severely criticized by the audience for using Shandong local dialect... Do we still want to make mistakes and go the old way?

    Film is a modern art form, and it serves audiences across the country. Since we want the entire audience to be able to understand, film actors must learn standard Mandarin. If this can be achieved, film actors will be a very powerful force in promoting Mandarin.

    As a film writer, I am willing to support the standardization of modern Chinese and the movement to promote Mandarin, like all filmmakers, and I am willing to contribute my greatest strength to promote the early success of this movement!

### 电影工作者必须重视语言问题

　　电影工作者必须重视语言问题
　　孙谦
    电影是最接近群众的艺术。一九五四年的电影观众已达到八亿二千多万人次；就是说，每天都有二百万以上的观众受着电影语言的影响。
    促进现代汉语规范化和推行普通话是汉民族的政治任务。在这样光荣的任务面前，电影艺术工作者应该严肃地检查一下电影在使用语言上所存在的缺点。
    要求使用的语言丰富多采、明确生动、有形象、有性格，这是所有文学艺术的共同特点，电影也不例外。但是电影有着胶片的尺数限制，因此它使用的语言必须更洗炼、更精确、更富于表现力。这是一点极普通的道理。遗憾的是我们电影艺术工作者过去并没有充分重视它。影片是根据文学剧本摄制的，但是我们的电影编剧（当然也包括我在内）还不善于把日常生活中的语言，经过适当的加工，提炼成为文学语言；因而我们的影片在使用语言上，就显得臃肿、啰嗦、冗长、沉闷和老一套。
    电影语言的贫乏和枯涩现象已经是我们的老问题了，但是直到现在还没有设法冲开这道关口。有些影片的台词没有形象，没有性格。就是把两个甚至两个以上人物的对话调换一下，也不会妨碍剧情的进展。三部影片里都有工厂党委书记这一人物，而三个人物的台词又差不多是一模一样的，要是让扮演这三位工厂党委书记的演员在影片拍摄的中途互相串换一下，这三部影片还是可以照样拍摄下去，——概念化的语言不可能充分地表达人物的思想感情，不可能表现人物的性格，因此也就不可能激起观众欣赏语言艺术的兴趣。
    为了突破语言贫乏的尴尬局面，有些电影编剧
    （也包括我在内）曾走过另外一条弯路：用最省力的自然主义的方法，滥用成语、谚语、歇后语和语意不明、有语病的话，造成语言的不纯和混乱。
    成语、谚语和歇后语有个共同的特点：有节奏、有形象、生动活泼、富有表现力。按照人物性格的需要是可以适当地采用的。但也有不少是芜杂、过时、已经不再有生命的糟粕，要切忌滥用。我们有这样一部影片，剧中人物都会说歇后语，整个村庄的农民都变成了歇后语专家。生活里没有这样的现象，这就是滥用。
    解放以后，群众的生活起了变化，因而群众的语言也起了变化——一些新的语言词汇在群众中流传着，成长着。我们不能也不应该把群众学习新词汇过程中产生的语病现象，不加修正地搬进电影里。遗憾的是在我们的影片里常常可以听到这样一些台词：“没有文化水儿”（原意是文化水平不高）、“挨了一批”（受了批评）、“奔社会儿”
    （走社会主义的路）等等——这种猎奇式的“创造”语言的后果，除了破坏我们纯洁的语言以外，什么好处也没有。
    一般地说，电影不完全排斥适当地采用方言。方言可以丰富我们的普通话，也可以增加影片故事的地方色彩。但是采用方言的原则是必须使普通观众都能听的明白、听的清楚。我们不赞成把“蹲下”说成“趷蹴下”，也不赞成把“老都老了”，说成
    “老都老球了”，更不赞成强迫观众去领教那些冷僻古怪的“地方风味”。
    电影语言是表现人物性格的。少部分的电影艺术工作者曾经有过一种极错误的见解：要表现工农兵的生活就得使用脏话——骂娘、骂老子。事实证明：脏话只能污损我们的语言。我们的电影是教育新人的工具，必须坚决地摈弃那些庸俗的肮脏话，决不能让那些不堪入耳的语言，继续出现在我们影片的声带里！
    作家是语言的创造者，而不是语言的破坏者。电影剧作家有责任创造优美动人的电影语言。
    电影演员（包括译制片演员）是文学语言的直接传播者。在推行普通话的运动中，电影演员负有特别重要的任务——每天有二百万以上的人听着他们说话，跟着他们学习普通话。电影演员必须学会说普通话，而且要说得纯正，说得标准。但是我们还有些电影演员的语音并不标准，往往在一部影片中同一家庭里，会出现各种各样的语音，有的是因为不会说北京音而用地方音，有的是会用北京音而故意用地方音。直到现在还有极少数的电影演员迷恋地方音和家乡话，他们说：使用地方语音可以引起“创作情绪”，可以“突出人物性格”。我们认为这是一种不正确的创作方法。京戏里的诸葛亮并不说胶东腔，“红楼梦”里的林黛玉也不说江南话，可是他们的性格多么生动、多么鲜明！
    其实在语音问题上，我们已经吃过苦头、受过教训了。用陕北话拍摄的“陕北牧歌”，因为观众听不懂，不得不全部改为普通话重新录音；“春风吹到诺敏河”是一部描写农业合作化的影片，但是关内农民不能完全听懂东北话，因而减弱了影片的教育作用；“关连长”因为使用山东土腔遭到了观众严厉的批评……难道我们还想犯错误、还想走老路子吗？
    电影是现代化的艺术，它是为全国的观众服务的。既然要想全国观众都能听得明白，电影演员就必须学好标准的普通话。如果能够做到这样，电影演员将是推行普通话的一支极有力量的队伍。
    作为一个电影编剧，我愿意和所有的电影工作者一样，拥护现代汉语规范化和推行普通话运动，愿意贡献出自己最大的力量，以便促进这一运动早日取得成功！
