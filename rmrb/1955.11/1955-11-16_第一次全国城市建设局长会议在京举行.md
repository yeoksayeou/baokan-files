　　Xinhua News Agency, 15th dispatch: The Urban Construction Bureau held a conference of urban construction bureau directors from various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions in Beijing from the 2nd to the 12th of this month.

　　This was the first national conference of urban construction bureau directors convened by the Urban Construction Bureau since its establishment in April of this year.

　　The conference first studied the work tasks and organizational structure of the urban construction departments. During the period of the First Five-Year Plan, in coordination with the industrial construction centered on the 156 projects, several cities will build a large number of technically complex water supply and drainage projects and other municipal engineering projects with strict quality requirements; hydrogeological exploration will also be intensified. At the same time, as the Ministry of Construction Engineering has gradually shifted to undertaking industrial building design and construction tasks, most of the civil building design and construction tasks in cities have been handed over to the urban construction departments of various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions. The conference believes that the work tasks of urban construction departments have become much more arduous and complex than in the past, and the urban construction forces in some provinces and autonomous regions are relatively weak, and the organizational structure is not sound, and some have not yet been established. Therefore, it is necessary to establish and improve organizational structures as soon as possible to meet the needs of the work. In addition to clarifying the guidelines and tasks of urban construction work, the conference also conducted specific research on the focus of urban construction work in different regions and the issue of organizational structure.

　　Regarding the municipal engineering construction and hydrogeological exploration of several newly built and major expanded industrial cities, the Urban Construction Bureau has previously held special meetings to make specific arrangements. The conference requires the urban construction departments of the newly built and major expanded industrial cities to actively organize forces, closely coordinate, grasp the overall progress and every link of urban construction, and conduct timely inspections to actively strive to ensure the needs of national industrial construction. The urban construction departments of coastal provinces and cities must vigorously support them.

　　In recent years, the civil building design forces of various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions have gradually developed from scratch, from small to large, and have completed a large number of civil building design tasks, playing a certain role in national construction. However, the organizational status and technical level of the design team are currently unable to adapt to the increasing tasks in the future. The conference studied the preliminary plan proposed by the Urban Construction Bureau regarding the adjustment of civil building design forces in various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, and suggested that various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions gradually and appropriately concentrate the use of civil building design forces and adjust civil building design institutions according to needs and possibilities. It is also planned to first establish a number of regional urban construction design institutes in areas with conditions and work needs, in accordance with the above spirit, to each undertake the individual design and standard design tasks of civil buildings in a certain area. In addition, there should be a gradual and planned adjustment of forces or tasks between regions where forces and tasks are unbalanced. After the adjustment of civil building design institutions, the forces are concentrated, the types of work are more complete, and the leadership is strengthened, which facilitates the promotion of advanced technology and management systems, and can complete more and larger design tasks.

　　In order to further improve the management level of civil building enterprises in provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, to support new industrial cities and industrial construction departments, and to comprehensively arrange civil building construction forces from a long-term planning perspective, the conference discussed and proposed preliminary plans and measures regarding the rectification of construction organizations and the adjustment of construction forces.

### 第一次全国城市建设局长会议在京举行

　　第一次全国城市建设局长会议在京举行
    新华社十五日讯　城市建设总局自二日到十二日在北京召开各省市自治区城市建设局长会议。
    这是城市建设总局自今年四月成立以来召开的第一次全国性的城市建设局长会议。
    这次会议首先研究了城市建设部门的工作任务和组织机构的问题。在第一个五年计划期间，配合以一五六项工程为中心的工业建设，若干城市将要建设大量技术复杂的、工程质量要求严格的给水排水工程和其他市政工程；水文地质勘察工作也将要加紧进行。同时，由于建筑工程部已逐渐转向担负工业建筑设计与施工的任务，大部分城市民用建筑设计与施工任务已交由各省、市、自治区城市建设部门担负。会议认为，城市建设部门的工作任务已比过去艰巨复杂得多，而有些省和自治区的城市建设力量比较薄弱，机构也不健全，有的还未建立，因此必须从速建立和健全组织机构，才能适应工作需要。会议除了明确城市建设工作的方针、任务以外，并对不同地区城市建设工作的重点以及机构的设置问题，作了具体的研究。
    关于若干新建和重大扩建的工业城市的市政工程建设和水文地质勘察工作，城市建设总局已事先召开专门的会议作了具体安排。这次会议要求各新建和重大扩建的工业城市的城市建设部门，必须积极组织力量，密切联系配合，抓紧城市建设的总进度和每一个环节，及时检查，为保证国家工业建设的需要而积极努力。沿海各省市的城市建设部门必须大力加以支援。
    几年来，各省、市、自治区民用建筑设计力量已经从无到有、从小到大逐渐发展起来，完成了很大的民用建筑设计任务，对国家建设起了一定的作用。但是目前设计队伍的组织状况和技术水平还不能适应今后日益增加的任务。这次会议研究了城市建设总局提出的关于调整各省、市、自治区民用建筑设计力量的初步方案，建议各省、市、自治区根据需要和可能，逐步适当地集中使用民用建筑设计力量，调整民用建筑设计机构。并计划在有条件和工作需要的地区，依照上述精神，首先成立若干地区性的城市建筑设计院，各自承担一定地区的民用建筑个体设计和标准设计任务。此外，力量与任务不平衡的地区之间，还要逐步地有计划的调剂力量或调剂任务。民用建筑设计机构调整之后，力量集中，工种比较齐全，领导加强，就便于推广先进技术和管理制度，可以完成更多更大的设计任务。
    为了进一步提高省、市、自治区民用建筑企业的管理水平，为了支援新工业城市和工业建筑部门，并且从长远计划着眼来全面安排民用建筑施工力量，这次会议经过讨论，并提出了关于整顿施工组织和调整施工力量的初步方案和措施。
