Chongqing local industry has reduced wholesale and retail prices for 434 products, effective November 5th.

The products with reduced prices include daily necessities, cultural goods, as well as electrical equipment and chemical raw materials, with an average reduction of about 10%.

The price reduction of these local industrial products is the result of the hard work of employees in many factories to improve product quality and reduce costs during the increased production and frugality campaign. For example, employees of the local state-owned Chongqing Thermos Factory continuously reduced raw material consumption quotas and saved management costs. The total cost in August this year was actually 23.25% lower than in the first half of the year. As a result, the wholesale price of five-pound bamboo shell thermos bottles produced by this factory was reduced from 21.8 yuan per dozen to 18.47 yuan, a reduction of 15.27%. Employees of the local state-owned Chongqing Electrical Equipment Factory found ways to improve the quality of electric fans and used substitutes to reduce costs, so that each 16-inch desk fan was reduced from 175 yuan to 145 yuan. Other products had relatively large industrial and commercial profits in the past, and the price was reduced after consultation between industrial and commercial departments according to the principle of comparing quality and price based on the state's price policy.

The reduced prices of these products will further meet the needs of production and construction and the people's lives. Taking the thermos bottles and rubber shoes purchased and supplied by the state-owned department store Chongqing Purchasing and Supply Station in the fourth quarter of this year as an example, urban and rural people can reduce their expenditure by more than 140,000 yuan by purchasing these two products alone.

### 重庆地方工业降低四百多种产品的价格

　　重庆地方工业降低四百多种产品的价格
    重庆地方工业有四百三十四种产品，从十一月五日起降低了批发价格和零售价格。
    这次降低价格的产品中，有人民生活日用品、文化用品，也有电工器材和化工原料，一般降低了百分之十左右。
    这次地方工业产品降价，是许多厂的职工在增产节约运动中，努力提高产品质量和降低成本的结果。如地方国营重庆热水瓶厂职工不断降低了原材料的消耗定额和节约管理费用，今年八月份的总成本比今年上半年度实际降低了百分之二十三点二五，因此使这个厂生产的五磅竹壳热水瓶每打批发价由二十一元八角，降为十八元四角七分，降低了百分之十五点二七。地方国营重庆电工器材厂职工想办法提高电风扇的质量，并采用代用品降低了成本，使十六寸台风扇每部由一百七十五元降为一百四十五元。另外一些产品是过去工商利润较大，经过工业和商业部门根据国家的价格政策原则，按照比质比价的办法协商后降低的。
    由于这些产品降低了价格，将进一步满足生产建设和人民生活的需要。仅以国营百货公司重庆采购供应站在今年第四季度采购供应的热水瓶和胶鞋来估算，城乡人民因购买这两种产品就可以减少十四万多元的开支。
