　　Xinhua News Agency, November 23rd, New York: U.S. military authorities recently conducted large-scale joint land and air force atomic war exercises in the Fort Polk area of Louisiana.

　　In this exercise, 140,000 troops, 1,200 aircraft, and atomic missiles launched from the air and ground were deployed. In addition, aircraft were dispatched to spread nerve gas to attack the imaginary enemy.

　　U.S. Army Secretary Bruck, who visited the exercise on the 19th, said that he hoped this exercise would enable the U.S. military to "better control atomic weapons." He said that atomic weapons are now "particularly important." U.S. Tactical Air Force Commander Wyland, who commanded the exercise, said in summarizing the lessons learned from this exercise: "The use of atomic weapons greatly increases the value of pre-emptive strikes and surprise attacks. This is very clear to me."

　　美举行大规模原子战争演习
    新华社二十三日讯　纽约消息：美国军事当局最近在路易斯安那州波克堡地区举行了大规模的陆空军联合原子战争演习。
    在这次演习中出动了十四万军队、一千二百架飞机以及从空中和地上发出的原子飞弹。此外还派出飞机散布神经毒气来进攻假想敌人。
    参观演习的美国陆军部长布鲁克十九日说，他希望这次演习能使美国军队“更好地操纵原子武器”。他说，原子武器现在“特别重要”。指挥演习的美国战术空军司令威兰在总结在这次演习中所取得的教训时说：“使用原子武器大大增加了先发制人和突袭的价值，这一点对我是很清楚的。”
