　　Advancing on the Socialist Road
　　More Than Four Hundred Advanced Workers Begin Executing Next Year's Production Plans
    By the end of October, Qishuyan, Changxindian, and Shijiazhuang locomotive and rolling stock repair factories already had three hundred and thirteen advanced workers who had completed their annual workload ahead of schedule and began executing next year's production plans. These many advanced workers all improved production efficiency and overfulfilled production tasks after diligently studying Soviet Kolesov tool post method and Zhuang Minggeng operation method and many other advanced experiences. Young turner Le Junde, one of the 269 people at Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory who completed his annual task ahead of schedule, took advantage of every opportunity to learn from advanced Soviet experiences and improve his work, exceeding his monthly production tasks. By late September, he had completed his annual workload. Wang Xinnian, a turner at Shijiazhuang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, has successively improved nine kinds of tools and one operation method. Last year, he completed three years' worth of work, and now he is already doing the work for September 1957. After learning the Kolesov tool post method and Zhuang Minggeng operation method, Zhang Jinming, a young turner at Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, increased the feed rate and depth of cut, and the lathe speed increased by one-third; at the same time, he did a good job in pre-production preparation and implemented segmented operations, which generally improved the efficiency of turning workpieces by one to two times. By August 10, he had completed his annual production task, and now he is already doing the work for June 1956. Encouraged by the advanced deeds of these workers, many workers in these three factories have also revised their production plans for the fourth quarter, striving to complete their annual work tasks ahead of schedule.
  The state-owned Shanghai Machine Tool Plant also had one hundred and forty-four workers who began doing the work for 1956 at the end of October. Among them are labor model and famous turner Sheng Li; labor model and milling worker Li Yongshun; advanced worker model boring worker Sun Fengyi, who has not had any equipment or work-related injury accidents in six years; and young gear hobbing worker Li Huashan, who completed seven months' worth of work in September and October.

　　在社会主义的道路上前进
　　四百多名先进工人开始执行明年生产计划
    到十月底，戚墅堰、长辛店和石家庄等机车车辆修理工厂已经有三百一十三名先进工人提前完成了全年工作量，开始执行明年的生产计划。这许多先进工人，都是在努力学习苏联科列索夫车刀法和庄铭耕操作法等许多先进经验之后，提高了生产效率，因而超额完成了生产任务。青年车工乐俊德，是戚墅堰机车车辆修理工厂提前完成全年任务的二百六十九人中的一个，他利用一切机会学习苏联先进经验，改进工作，每月都超额完成生产任务，到九月下旬，他就完成了全年工作量。石家庄机车车辆修理工厂车工王新年，先后改进了九种工具和一种操作方法，去年一年完成三年的工作量，现在，他已经在做一九五七年九月份的工作了。长辛店机车车辆修理工厂青年车工张金铭，学习科列索夫车刀法和庄铭耕操作方法后，加大了走刀量和吃刀量，车床转数提高了三分之一；同时他做好了生产前的准备工作，实行分段作业，车工作物普遍提高效率一倍到两倍，到八月十日就完成了全年生产任务，现在，他已经做一九五六年六月份的工作了。在这些工人先进事迹的鼓舞下，这三个工厂内的许多工人也都纷纷修订了第四季度的生产计划，争取提前完成全年工作任务。
  国营上海机床厂也已经有一百四十四个工人，在十月底就开始做一九五六年的工作了。他们当中有劳动模范、著名的车工盛利；有劳动模范、铣工李永顺；有六年不出设备和工伤事故的先进工作者样板镗工孙凤仪；有在九、十两个月完成七个月工作量的青年滚齿工李华山。
