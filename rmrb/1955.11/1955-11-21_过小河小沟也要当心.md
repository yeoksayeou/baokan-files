　  Be Careful Even When Crossing Small Rivers and Ditches

　  The construction of the Xi'an Central Shaft in Liaoyuan City, Jilin Province, has been basically completed and has begun trial production. As a result, the leaders breathed a sigh of relief and thought, "We've crossed the major rivers, what do we have to fear from small rivers and ditches?" They regarded the quality problems of the operating equipment and the problems that needed to be solved in the construction as "minor problems" and did not carefully inspect and deal with them. As a result, unexpectedly, a quality accident occurred less than three days into the trial production, and they had to spend more than ten days reworking it.

　  The Third Construction Site of the Fourth Engineering Department of the Lanzhou Engineering General Company of the Ministry of Construction undertook the construction of four buildings this year. When the first two buildings were under construction, the leaders attached great importance to it, and the technical personnel were also active and responsible, often going deep into the site for inspection and guidance, overcoming the difficulties of weak technical forces, and overfulfilling the production tasks. At this time, the leading staff became complacent, feeling that since the first two buildings were completed smoothly, there would be no major problems with the latter two buildings, so they no longer did meticulous organizational work, only arranged work for the various functional departments without checking, only stipulated various systems without implementing them, and some staff members were not responsible enough for their work. As a result, on-site management became more and more chaotic, rework accidents and work-related injuries occurred frequently, and waste increased again.

　  What affects the speed of construction and hinders the completion of the national plan is often not technical difficulties that cannot be overcome, but the enemy in people's hearts—slack and complacent emotions. Therefore, we must be careful when crossing major rivers, and we must also be careful when crossing small rivers and ditches.

　  过小河小沟也要当心
    吉林辽源市西安中央竖井的建设已经基本上完工，开始试生产了。于是，领导人员松了一口气，觉得“大江大河都过去了，小河小沟还怕什么？”他们把能运转的设备质量问题和施工中需要解决的问题，都看成是“小问题”，不认真检查处理。结果，出乎意料，试生产不到三天，就出了质量事故，不得不花十多天时间返工。
    建筑工程部兰州工程总公司第四工程处第三工地，今年负责修筑四幢大楼。最先两幢大楼施工的时候，领导人员很重视，技术人员也积极负责，经常深入现场检查和指导，克服了技术力量薄弱的困难，超额完成了生产任务。这时，领导工作人员便自满起来，觉得前两幢大楼既然很顺利地完工了，后两幢大楼也不会有大的问题，便不再去做细致的组织工作，对各职能部门的工作只布置不检查，对各种制度只规定不执行，部分工作人员对工作也就不够负责了。结果，现场管理一天比一天混乱，返工事故和工伤事故不断发生，浪费现象又多起来。
    影响建设速度，阻碍国家计划完成的，常常不是什么克服不了的技术上的困难，而是人们内心的敌人——松懈自满情绪。所以，我们过大江大河要小心，过小河小沟也要当心。
