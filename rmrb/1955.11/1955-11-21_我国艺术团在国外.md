Our Art Troupe Abroad
　　Yugoslav Newspapers Praise Our Art Troupe
Belgrade Dispatch: Yugoslav newspapers on November 18 published numerous commentaries, warmly praising the Chinese Art Troupe's performances in Yugoslavia.
    "Politika" wrote that the Chinese Art Troupe, after achieving a series of successes at the Second International Theater Festival in Paris and during its European tour, is now continuing to achieve success in Belgrade. This wonderful troupe of singing, acting, dancing, and martial arts performances is flawless. The audience was captivated by the effects and content of the Chinese artists' performances.
    "Vecernje Novosti" published an article by critic Bogdanović, who wrote: "This is a drama that depicts a distant life, but one that is completely imaginable in terms of human emotions. Moreover, it is a drama that lives completely in extremely ancient forms. But it is precisely this element of human emotion, which is so dear to us, that moves us with this ancient, historical form, and makes it so touching and perfect in its expression and technique today. It is with this human and artistically perfect element that they have captivated us."
    Critic and writer Finci said: "What impressed me most was the excellent artistic treatment of the most basic elements of prehistoric fantasy, passion, and mythical forms. I believe that the art they have shown us belongs to the ranks of the greatest artistic achievements."
    National Theater Director Đoković wrote in an article: "The scale of the art that the Chinese are performing for us here is extremely large. There are beautiful, rich colors, tones, forms, and expressions. What particularly moves me is the profound, beautiful, humane, and emotionally rich lyrical performance of these dramas. Regarding these, we have only seen a very small part. They are indeed great artists. They have brought their distant country closer to us and helped us feel the treasures of its soul."

　　Our Classical Song and Dance Troupe Performs in Denmark
    After performing in the Danish cities of Aarhus, Aalborg, and Odense, the Chinese Classical Song and Dance Troupe returned to the Danish capital, Copenhagen, on the evening of the 18th.
    The troupe arrived in Odense, the hometown of the world-famous fairytale writer Hans Christian Andersen, on the 15th. On the 16th and 17th, it gave two performances at the Odense Theatre. The performances were a great success. Dozens of directors and actors from the Odense Theatre unanimously expressed their admiration and praise for Chinese classical dramatic art at a reception held after the troupe's performance to welcome the Chinese actors. Lungevald, Chairman of the Board of the Odense Theatre, said:
  "We assure you that we understand the message you have brought us from the distant land of China. This message has given us an impression of beauty, passion, humor, and strength."
    During their stay in Odense, the troupe visited the Hans Christian Andersen House and the Hans Christian Andersen Park. The exhibits displayed in the Hans Christian Andersen House, which show the fairytale writer's beautiful fantasies and concern for the happy future of children, gave the Chinese artists a very deep impression. The Chinese artists also saw a stone statue of the "Wild Swans" from the Andersen fairytale, which is familiar to Chinese readers, in the Hans Christian Andersen Park. A Danish friend pointed to a small river in the park and said: "In Andersen's fairy tales, one can reach China from under this river. Today, artists sent from the mysterious China of the past are standing on this river. From your visit, we deeply realize that the Chinese people not only love their own national culture, but also respect the culture of other countries."
    The head of the troupe, Chu Tunan, met with the mayor of Odense, who welcomed the Chinese Classical Song and Dance Troupe to visit Andersen's hometown and expressed his deep gratitude to China for holding the 150th anniversary celebration of Andersen's birth this year. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　我国艺术团在国外
　  南斯拉夫报纸赞扬我国艺术团
    贝尔格莱德消息：十一月十八日的南斯拉夫报纸发表了许多评论，热烈赞扬中国艺术团在南斯拉夫的访问演出。
    “政治报”写道，中国艺术团在巴黎第二届国际戏剧节中和在欧洲旅行的时候曾经取得了一连串的成就，现在又在贝尔格莱德继续取得了成就。这个美妙的歌唱、动作、舞蹈和武技表演的剧团是完美无瑕的。观众被中国艺术家们的表演的效果和内容迷住了。
    “新闻晚报”发表了评论家鲍格达诺维奇的文章，他写道：“这是描写一种遥远的，但是从人情上说来完全是可以想像的生活的戏剧。此外它还是一种完全在极其古老的形式下活着的戏剧。但是正是这种对我们说来是如此亲切的人情因素，用这种古老的、历史悠久的形式感动我们，并且使得它在今天在表现和技术方面如此动人和完美。他们就是用这种人情和艺术上完美的因素迷住了我们。”
    评论家和作家芬奇说：“给我印象极深的是对于史前时代的幻想、热情和神话形式的最基本因素的出色的艺术处理。我认为，他们给我们看到的艺术是属于最伟大的艺术成就之列的。”
    国家剧院导演迪奥科维奇在文章中写道：“中国人在这里给我们表演的艺术的规模是大极了。其中有美丽、丰富的色彩、音调、形式和表现法。尤其令我感动的是这些戏剧的深刻、美好、合乎人情和感情非常丰富的抒情表演。关于这些，我们还只是看到了其中的很小一部分。他们的确是伟大的艺术家。他们使他们的辽远的国家接近了我们，并且帮助我们感受到了它的灵魂中的宝藏。”（新华社）
　  我国古典歌舞剧团在丹麦演出
    中国古典歌舞剧团在丹麦亚胡斯、阿尔堡和鄂丹斯三个城市举行演出后，在十八日晚回到丹麦首都哥本哈根。
    剧团在十五日到达世界著名的童话作家安徒生的故乡鄂丹斯。十六日和十七日在鄂丹斯剧院作了两次演出。演出获得了巨大的成功。鄂丹斯剧院的几十位导演和演员在剧团演出后举行的欢迎中国演员的招待会上一致对中国的古典戏剧艺术表示钦佩和赞叹。鄂丹斯剧院理事会主席隆格瓦尔德说：
  “我们向你们保证，我们了解你们从遥远的国度——中国给我们带来的心意。这种心意使我们得到了对美、对热情、对幽默和对力量的印象。”
    剧团在鄂丹斯期间参观了安徒生之家和安徒生公园。陈列在安徒生之家的那些表现这位童话作家的美丽的幻想和对儿童幸福未来的关怀的展览品给了中国艺术家非常深刻的印象。中国艺术家们还在安徒生公园中看到了为中国读者所熟悉的安徒生童话中的“野天鹅”的石雕像。一位丹麦朋友指着公园中的一条小河说：“在安徒生的童话中，从这条河底下可以到达中国。今天，从过去的神秘的中国派来的艺术家就站在这条河上。从你们的访问中，我们深深体会到：中国人民不仅是热爱自己的民族文化，而且也尊重其他国家的文化。”
    剧团团长楚图南会见了鄂丹斯市市长，市长对中国古典歌舞剧团来到安徒生的故乡访问表示欢迎，并且对中国在今年举行的安徒生诞辰一百五十周年纪念会深表感谢。　（新华社）
