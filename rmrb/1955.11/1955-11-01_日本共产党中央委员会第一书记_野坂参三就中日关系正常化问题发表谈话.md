Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, October 31st: According to a report in the "Akahata" newspaper on October 21st, Nozaka Sanzō, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, issued a statement on October 20th regarding the October 19th "People's Daily" editorial in Beijing, "Striving to Promote the Normalization of Sino-Japanese Relations."

Nozaka Sanzō said that the "People's Daily" editorial once again emphasized how much the Chinese government and people currently hope to normalize relations with Japan. The Japanese people also fervently demand the establishment of friendly relations, the development of trade, close cultural exchange, and people-to-people exchanges between the people of Japan and China. From the perspective of safeguarding peace in Asia and peace in Japan, the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations is also an extremely urgent issue.

Nozaka Sanzō pointed out that the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations, which the Japanese people fervently demand, has not been realized until now, and the problem lies with the Japanese government and the United States, which is manipulating the Japanese government from behind. This is because the Japanese government and reactionary forces, who act according to the will of the United States without listening to the voices of the Japanese people, use various methods to obstruct the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations. If this obstruction is not eliminated, normalization cannot be achieved no matter what. The power that can eliminate this obstruction is the power of the people.

Nozaka Sanzō then said that this power is now stronger than ever before. For example, five years ago, only a small number of people called for the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations. But now, not to mention the Communist Party and the Socialist Party, even Democrats and Liberals have expressed their support; at the same time, not only small and medium-sized capitalists, but also large capitalists are very active. Five years ago, no one could openly travel from Japan to China, but this year, 700 people from all walks of life in Japan have openly visited China with passports. This is the power of the people forcing the government to issue passports. Therefore, if we more broadly expand the national movement, there is no doubt that the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations will be realized.

Nozaka Sanzō concluded by saying: We fully endorse the spirit of the "People's Daily" editorial, and in the future, we must resolutely work hard to further develop the national movement and exert heavy pressure on the Japanese government. We also hope that people from all walks of life who have returned from visiting China will actively become the driving force behind this movement.

    日本共产党中央委员会第一书记
    野坂参三就中日关系正常化问题发表谈话
    新华社三十一日讯　东京消息：据“赤旗报”十月二十一日报道，日本共产党中央委员会第一书记野坂参三于十月二十日就北京“人民日报”十月十九日的社论“努力促进中日关系正常化”发表了谈话。
    野坂参三说：“人民日报”社论再一次着重指出了目前中国政府和人民是如何希望同日本的邦交正常化。日本人民也热烈要求日中两国人民建立友好关系、发展贸易、密切文化交流和人民的来往。从保卫亚洲和平和日本和平的意义上说，日中两国邦交正常化也是极其迫切的问题。
    野坂参三指出：日本人民热烈要求的日中两国邦交正常化直到现在未能实现，问题在于日本政府方面，在于背后操纵日本政府的美国方面。这就是因为不倾听日本人民的呼声而按照美国意旨行事的日本政府和反动势力，用各种方法来阻挠日中两国邦交正常化。如果不消除这种阻挠，无论怎样也不能实现邦交正常化。能够消除这种阻挠的，是人民的力量。
    野坂参三接着说，现在，这个力量已经强大到过去所不能比拟的程度了。譬如五年前，呼吁日中邦交正常化的只是很少一部分人。但是现在，不用说共产党和社会党，就连民主党人和自由党人也表示支持了；同时，不光是中小资本家，就连大资本家也很积极。五年前谁也不能公开从日本前往中国，但是今年已经有七百位日本各界人士公开地拿着护照访问了中国。这是人民的力量迫使政府发给护照的。所以，如果我们更广泛地扩大国民运动，无疑地一定会使日中两国邦交正常化得以实现。
    野坂参三最后说：我们全面拥护“人民日报”社论的精神，今后要坚决努力，更进一步开展国民运动，向日本政府施加沉重的压力。我们并且希望访问中国后回国的各界人士积极地成为这个运动的推动力量。
