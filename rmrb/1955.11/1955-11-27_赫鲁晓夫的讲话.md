Khrushchev's Speech

　　Friends, I call you that because the meeting we are attending is hosted by a friendship association aimed at developing and strengthening the ties of friendship between India and the Soviet Union. (Applause)
　　Like my friend Bulganin, I also want to thank the Chairman of the Association, Dr. Baliga, and the Governor of Bombay Province, Mr. Matab, for their assistance in the work of this association and for their kind invitation to visit your beautiful city. (Applause)
　　I would also like to thank the Chief Minister of your province, Mr. Desai. (Prolonged applause) Thank you to all who came here to meet with us. (Applause)
　　Sometimes, when you start speaking, you can't help but feel a little embarrassed until you find a suitable topic to talk about eloquently. (Lively atmosphere, applause) I think that at this moment, the theme of friendship between the people of all countries is a very good topic. There are all kinds of friendships. There is a friendship where people treat each other with sincerity; there is also a "friendship" where everyone is a neighbor, but they don't communicate with each other. (Laughter, applause)
　　The situation of countries is like this. There is no real friendship between some countries, but they live on the same planet, and whether they like it or not, they have to live in harmony.
　　Our great Lenin called this living together. The principle of co-existence is a very important principle. But some people raise the question: Is co-existence possible? It seems that there is no such question at all, because countries are actually co-existing. (Lively atmosphere) But, surprisingly, some people raise such questions.
　　I would like to tell you the following. The birth of a baby depends on the parents. But the day and hour the baby is born, and whether the baby will grow into the kind of person they hope for, does not depend on them. (Lively atmosphere) How can one try to stop the development of history, to stop the birth of new social forms? New, more progressive social forms replace outdated social forms, just like the sun comes out every morning. (Prolonged applause)
　　This is how our Soviet state was born. This is the first proletarian state, the state of workers and peasants, in the world. (Applause) When this country was born, no other country rang bells to welcome it. (Lively atmosphere)
　　Because the old Tsarist system in Russia had already decayed thoroughly, the October Revolution was almost bloodless. But then someone said to us – of course, not in those exact words, there was no record, but through actions: How and for what reason did the Soviet state appear? By what right did the workers and peasants seize power? (Lively atmosphere)
　　These people not only talked, but also sent their own troops to fight against the young Soviet state. French interventionists landed in Odessa, British interventionists landed in Arkhangelsk, American interventionists landed in Vladivostok, and the Japanese followed them.
　　Everyone knows the ending. The occupying forces were driven out by the Soviet people, just like a good housewife sweeps the garbage out of her house. (Laughter, stormy applause) But some grown-up gentlemen still weren't satisfied. They wanted to make a comeback, so they launched the Second World War. They threw the massive armed forces of Hitler's Germany at the Soviet Union.
　　Everyone also understands the ending. The Soviet Union once again annihilated the enemy. The Soviet Union not only did not weaken during the war, but became even stronger. (Applause) Now the Soviet people have healed the wounds of war, restored the destroyed economy, successfully completed the first post-war five-year plan, and are currently working on the second post-war five-year plan. Our country is thriving and prosperous.
　　I remember the early days of the October Revolution, I remember the years of the civil war, when only Lenin saw clearly the future development, saw clearly how powerful the newborn Soviet state would become.
　　The vast majority of people here are intellectuals. Therefore, I would like to talk to you about how the Russian intellectuals treated the revolution at that time. Many intellectuals welcomed the revolution and began to serve the young Soviet state faithfully. But some people discussed: What will the situation be in the future? Lenin and the Communists called on the workers and peasants to manage the country. Will uneducated workers and even more uneducated peasants lead the country! What will become of Russian culture? Who will become the connoisseurs of Russian art? It seems that the famous Russian ballet, which was already famous in the world before the revolution, will disappear! It seems that the opera art, which had a high level before the revolution, will disappear! It seems that other forms of art will not be supported! There will be no real connoisseurs!
　　But life refuted all these doubts. Now the level of Soviet culture is much higher than the level of old Russian culture. Many of you have visited the Soviet Union in these years. They have personally seen that art in the Soviet Union has received such high evaluation as never before in the revolution. Workers and peasants selected excellent people from among themselves and sent them to universities and specialized schools to study, and they themselves also worked hard to study culture beside the machine tools. We are proud of this.
　　Whether our enemies like it or not, the Soviet Union still exists, and not only exists, but also grows and develops smoothly. Our economy is strengthening, culture is developing, and the people's welfare is growing.
　　All this is carried out under the condition that we have to take into account the existence of hostile forces, which have not given up their attempts to suffocate our country. We have to spend a lot of money on defense. If we could use all the funds spent on armaments entirely for peaceful purposes, then the welfare of our people would be further improved.
　　Our enemies understand this. That is why some foreign politicians are now afraid to seriously talk about disarmament and are unwilling to eliminate the tension in international relations. They are afraid that we will withdraw the funds currently used for national defense and use them for peaceful construction.
　　But despite this, we believe that under the current conditions, in the peaceful competition between the capitalist system and the socialist system, we will be victorious, and socialism will be victorious. (Prolonged applause)
　　Once at a reception in the Kremlin, I spoke openly about this. At that time, bourgeois journalists spread the news all over the world that Khrushchev "leaked the secret" and said that the Bolsheviks had not abandoned their political plans.
　　No, I did not leak a secret, nor did I say something I didn't mean, but said what we think and believe. We have never abandoned, and will never abandon, the political line instructed to us by Lenin, and we have never abandoned, and will never abandon, our own political program. (Prolonged applause)
　　Our proverb says well: "If you have good days, don't look for bad things!" (Lively atmosphere)
　　Why should we abandon the direction that has raised our country from a state of backwardness for many years to the level of the most advanced, industrially and economically developed countries! Why abandon it? For what?
　　This is why we want to say to those gentlemen who are waiting for the Soviet Union to change its political program: You wait for the sea shrimp to call! And you know when the sea shrimp will call. (Lively atmosphere)
　　Therefore, there is only another possibility – co-existence. The co-existence of two systems. The co-existence of the socialist system and the capitalist system.
　　Personally, I very much dislike the capitalist system. (Applause) I say co-existence, not because I hope capitalism exists, but because I cannot but admit that this system actually exists. (Laughter)
　　However, our opponents are unwilling to tolerate the existence of the socialist system, even though it is not only us who have established socialist countries, but also many other countries have embarked on this path. Our great friend – the great Chinese people are building socialism. This country is so big, as the saying goes, you cannot cross it without seeing it. A series of countries in Europe and Asia standing with the Soviet Union are building socialism.
　　Indian Prime Minister Nehru said that India will also move forward along the socialist road. (Stormy applause) This is very good. Of course, we have different understandings of socialism. But we welcome this expression and this trend.
　　It can be seen that the socialist system exists and there is no need to ask anyone's permission. (Laughter, applause) We not only exist, but we are also fully capable of protecting our right to survive.
　　If we were only asking for this right to survive, then we would have been eliminated by others long ago.
　　No matter how the enemy hopes for our demise, this is beyond their power. (Prolonged applause)
　　This means that whether you want it or not, like it or not, socialist countries and capitalist countries must live on the same earth.
　　We tell some capitalist countries that if you don't like us and don't invite us to be guests, we will still survive.
　　This is the situation in the modern world.
　　We advocate co-existence that can promote the normal development of mutual contact between countries, and we advocate trade with all countries. I hope they come to buy things from us, and we also buy things from them.
　　Now, they are trying to implement trade discrimination against us and do not want to trade with us in important goods. But our country is still developing and consolidating. I might as well tell everyone that their discrimination will only prompt us to concentrate all our efforts to produce the goods that capitalists are unwilling to sell to us. We now produce these goods ourselves, and are increasingly developing. In this way, it seems that the trade discrimination policy is not harmful to us, but has helped us.
　　We also advocate further expanding cultural exchanges between countries. We hope that capitalist countries will send more people to visit us, and people from our country will visit these countries more often.
　　Some people blame us, insisting that we created some kind of "iron curtain". But just this year, a large number of American senators, many American scientists and journalists have visited the Soviet Union, and American and British farmers and American veterans have also visited us.
　　We do not refuse anyone who is willing to visit our country.
　　You probably all know the story of Noah's Ark in the Bible. When Noah chose animals to board his ark, he chose seven pairs of all clean animals, and two pairs of unclean animals. I can tell you: More unclean people than that have been to our country, and we have received them one by one, we are not afraid. (Lively atmosphere)
　　We believe that if an unclean person comes to our place, he will not contaminate us.
　　This means that if the development of international cultural exchanges is not as fast as desired, then this is not our fault.
　　These are some issues of peaceful co-existence. I think that if it is necessary to find a model of co-existence, then our relationship with India is such a model. We not only co-exist, but also get along friendly, although we have different political views on many issues. The basis of this friendship is our common struggle for peace. Therefore, we should not relax our efforts in this area. We will continue to destroy everything that hinders peaceful co-existence in the future. We will strengthen everything that helps develop peaceful co-existence among countries.
　　After the Geneva Conference, we have achieved very small, perhaps extremely subtle achievements in this regard. The four-nation foreign ministers' conference has just ended not long ago. This meeting did not achieve the results we expected. But we are not particularly sad about this. It seems that the time has not yet come. The time to solve the problem has not matured. The other party does not give up the idea of negotiating with us from the so-called "position of strength".
　　I should once again frankly warn: Whoever wants to negotiate with us from a "position of strength" will not gain anything.
　　Generally speaking, it will probably be necessary to postpone the resolution of those issues discussed in Geneva for the time being. Well, we are willing to wait, we are not in a hurry. We will wait for good weather. We will wait for the day when these issues can be resolved in accordance with the interests of the people.
　　I read some government officials' comments on the results of the Geneva Conference in India. I am satisfied that the words of the people who participated in the Geneva Conference were measured. This shows that they are obviously unwilling to indulge their emotions now and sharpen the international situation.
　　I am going to end my speech. Co-existence is necessary. We do not ask or beg for it, but we actually exist, just as capitalist countries actually exist. No one can move us to Mars, and scientists have not yet come up with such a method. Obviously, capitalist countries are also unwilling to move to Mars.
　　(Lively atmosphere) This means that we have to live on one earth. And living is co-existence.
　　In this case, the issue is to stop the aggressive forces from launching a new war.
　　The work of your association helps to solve the problem of peaceful co-existence. The better we understand each other, the closer we cooperate, the more we help each other, then the stronger the forces of peace will be, which will also restrain the aggressive forces. Because aggressors will not change their aggressive bad habits, only active actions and the active struggle of the people of all countries for peace can restrain them. (Applause)
　　I propose a toast to everyone present, to everyone who works hard in this direction. Friends, I propose a toast to friendship and your health. (Stormy prolonged applause)

### 赫鲁晓夫的讲话

1955-11-27
第4版()
专栏：

　　赫鲁晓夫的讲话
    朋友们，我所以这样称呼你们，是因为我们参加的会是由以发展和加强印度和苏联的友谊联系为目的的友好协会主持的。（掌声）
    像我的朋友布尔加宁一样，我也要感谢协会主席巴利加博士和孟买省长马塔布先生，因为他们协助了这个协会的工作，并且盛意地邀请我们来访问你们这个美好的城市。（掌声）
    我还要感谢贵省的首席部长德赛先生。（经久不息的掌声）感谢所有来这里同我们会面的人。（掌声）
    有时，开始讲话的时候，当你还没有找到恰当的话题可以侃侃而谈以前，总不免有些狼狈。（会场活跃，掌声）我认为，此刻，各国人民友谊的主题就是一个很好的话题。友谊是有各种各样的。有这样的友谊：人们推诚相见；也有这样的“友谊”：大家是邻居，但是互不往来。（笑声，掌声）
    国家的情况是这样。在某些国家之间没有真正的友谊，但是它们住在一个行星上，不管愿意和不愿意都要和睦相处下去。
    我们伟大的列宁把这种生活叫做共处。共处的原则是一个十分重要的原则。但是有人提出这样的问题：共处是不是可能呢？看来，根本不存在这样的问题，因为各国实际上在共处着。（全场活跃）但是，居然有人提出这样的问题。
    我愿意向你们讲讲以下的话。婴儿的诞生是要靠爸爸妈妈的。但是婴儿在哪一天和哪一个钟头诞生以及婴儿将来是不是长成他们希望的那样一种人，就不依赖于他们了。（全场活跃）怎么可以企图阻止历史的发展、阻止新的社会形式的诞生呢？新的更进步的社会形式代替过时的社会形式，正像每天早晨太阳要出来一样。（经久不息的掌声）
    我们的苏维埃国家就是这样诞生的。这是世界上第一个无产阶级国家，工农国家。（掌声）这个国家出世时，所有其他国家都没有鸣钟欢迎。（全场活跃）
    因为旧的沙皇制度在俄国已经腐朽透了，所以，十月革命几乎是不流血的。但是，随后有人对我们说——当然用的不是这样的字眼，没有什么记录，而是用行动：苏维埃国家是怎么样、而且有什么理由出现呢？工人和农民根据什么权利把政权掌握在自己的手里呢？（全场活跃）
    这些人不光是说说，而且派遣自己的军队来反对年轻的苏维埃国家。法国干涉者在敖德萨登陆，英国干涉者在阿尔汉格尔登陆，美国干涉者在海参崴登陆，继他们之后日本人也来了。
    结局如何，大家都很清楚。占领者的军队被苏联人民赶走了，就像一个好的家庭主妇把垃圾从自己的屋中扫出去一样。（笑声，暴风雨般的掌声）但是，某些大人先生们还嫌不够。他们要卷土重来，于是发动了第二次世界大战。他们把希特勒德国的庞大武装部队投向苏联。
    结局怎么样，大家也很明白。苏联又一次歼灭了敌人。苏联在战争的过程中不仅没有削弱，而且变得更加强大了。（掌声）现在苏联人民已经医治好战争创伤，恢复了被破坏了的经济，胜利地完成了战后第一个五年计划，目前正在着手完成战后第二个五年计划。我们的国家在蓬勃发展，繁荣昌盛。
    我记得十月革命的开头那些日子，记得国内战争的年头，那时候只有列宁看清楚将来的发展，看清楚初生的苏维埃国家将成为一个多么强大的国家。
    在这里的绝大多数的人是知识分子。因此我想跟大家谈谈那时候的俄国知识分子是怎样对待革命的。许多知识分子欢迎革命，开始忠心地为年轻的苏维埃国家服务。但是有些人却议论说：将来的情况怎样呢？列宁和共产党人号召工农管理国家。没有文化的工人和更加没有文化的农民来领导国家吗！俄国的文化将要变成什么样子呢？谁将成为俄国艺术的鉴赏人呢？看来革命以前就已经闻名世界的著名的俄国巴蕾舞将要没有了！看来革命以前就有高度水平的歌剧艺术将要没有了！看来其他形式的艺术也将不会得到支持了！将没有真正的鉴赏家了！
    但是生活驳斥了这一切的怀疑。现在苏维埃文化的水平比旧俄的文化水平要高得多。你们当中的许多人在这些年代中访问了苏联。他们已经亲眼看到，艺术在苏联得到了在革命以前任何时候所没有的那么高的评价。工人和农民从自己人当中选出了优秀的人物，把他们送到大学和专科学校学习，他们自己也在机床旁边努力地学习文化。我们以此自豪。
    不论我们的敌人对这件事愿意还是不愿意，苏联还是存在着，而且，不仅仅是存在，同时还在顺利地成长和发展着。我们的经济在加强，文化在发展，人民的福利在增长。
    这一切都是在这样的条件下进行的：我们不得不考虑到敌对势力的存在，这种势力还没有放弃窒息我们国家的企图。我们不得不在防务上耗费不少的资金。如果我们能把所有用在军备上的资金完全用于和平的目的，那末，我国人民的福利就会得到更多的提高。
    我们的敌人是明白这一点的。这就是为什么某些外国政治家现在不敢认真地谈论裁军，不愿意消除国际关系中的紧张局势。他们害怕我们会把目前用于国防的资金抽出来用到和平建设中去。
    但是尽管这样，我们相信，在目前的条件下，在资本主义制度和社会主义制度之间的和平竞赛中，我们将得到胜利，社会主义将得到胜利。（经久不息的掌声）
    有一回在克里姆林宫的招待会上，我公开讲到这一点。当时，资产阶级记者们就向全世界散布消息说，赫鲁晓夫“泄漏了秘密”，他说布尔什维克没有放弃自己的政治计划。
    不，我并没有泄漏秘密，也没有说走了嘴，而是说出了我们所想的和所相信的事情。我们从来没有放弃，并且将来也不会放弃列宁给我们指示的政治路线，从来没有放弃，并且将来也不会放弃自己的政治纲领。（经久不息的掌声）
    我们的谚语说得好：“有了好日子就不找坏东西！”（全场活跃）
    我们为什么要放弃已经把我们国家从多年落后的状态提高到最先进的、在工业和经济上最发达的国家的水平的那个方向！为什么要放弃？为了什么？
    这就是我们为什么要向那些等待苏联改变自己的政治纲领的先生们这样说：你们等着海虾叫吧！而你们知道海虾什么时候叫。（全场活跃）
    因此，只有另一个可能性——共处。两种制度共处。社会主义制度同资本主义制度共处。
    我个人是十分不喜欢资本主义制度的。（掌声）我说共处，并不是因为希望资本主义存在，而是因为不能不承认这个制度实际上是存在的。（笑声）
    可是，我们的反对者无论如何也不愿意容忍社会主义制度的存在，尽管建立了社会主义国家的不仅仅是我们，走上这条道路的还有其他很多国家。我们巨大的朋友——伟大的中国人民正在建设社会主义，这个国家之大，正如俗话所说，你不能不看到它就跨过它。欧洲和亚洲有一系列的、同苏联站在一起的国家正在建设社会主义。
    印度总理尼赫鲁先生说，印度也将沿着社会主义道路前进。（暴风雨般的掌声）这很好。当然，我们对社会主义问题有着不同的理解。但是我们欢迎这种表示和这种趋向。
    由此可见，社会主义制度是存在的，用不着去请求谁的许可。（笑声、掌声）我们不仅存在，而且我们能够充分地保护自己生存的权利。
    如果我们只是请求这种生存的权利，那末我们早就被别人消灭了。
    无论敌人怎样希望我们灭亡，但是，这是他们力量所不及的。（经久不息的掌声）
    这就是说，无论你愿意还是不愿意，喜欢还是不喜欢，社会主义国家同资本主义国家必须生存在一个地球上面。
    我们告诉一些资本主义国家说，如果你们不喜欢我们，不请我们去作客，但是，我们还是将生存下去。
    现代世界的情况就是如此。
    我们主张能够促进各国之间相互接触的正常发展的共处，我们主张同所有国家进行贸易。希望他们来向我们买东西，我们也向他们买东西。
    现在，他们企图对我们实行贸易上的歧视，不想同我们进行重要货物的贸易。但是我们的国家仍然在不断发展和巩固。不妨告诉大家，他们的歧视只会促使我们集中一切力量来生产资本家不愿意卖给我们的货物。我们现在自己生产这些货物，而且日益取得发展。这样看来，贸易歧视政策并不对我们有害，反而帮助了我们。
    我们还主张进一步扩大各国之间的文化交流。我们希望，资本主义国家派更多的人到我们那里访问，我们国家的人也更多地访问这些国家。
    有人责备我们，硬说我们制造了什么“铁幕”。但是仅仅在今年，就有大批美国参议员、不少的美国科学家和新闻记者访问了苏联，美国和英国的农民以及美国的退伍军人也到我们那里访问。
    凡是愿意访问我们国家的人，我们都不拒绝。
    你们大概都知道圣经中的挪亚方舟的故事。当挪亚选择动物到自己的方舟上的时候，凡洁净的动物各选七对，不洁净的动物各选两对。我可以告诉你们：有比这更多的不洁净的人到过我国，我们一一接待了他们，我们是不害怕的。（全场活跃）
    我们认为，如果一个不洁净的人来到我们那里，他不会玷污我们。
    这就是说，如果国际文化交流的发展没有像所希望的那样快，那末这并不是我们的罪过。
    这就是和平共处的一些问题。我认为，如果需要找一个共处的典范，那末我们同印度的关系就是这样的典范。我们不但共处，而且友好相处，虽然在许多问题上有不同的政治观点。这种友谊的基础就是我们争取和平的共同斗争。因此我们不应该放松自己在这一方面的努力。我们今后仍要摧毁妨碍和平共处的一切东西。我们将加强有助于发展各国和平共处的一切东西。
    经过日内瓦会议后，在这一方面我们已经获得非常小的，也许极细微的成就。四国外长会议不久前已经结束。这一会议没有得到我们所期望的结果。但是我们并不因此而感到特别伤心。看来，时机还没有来到。解决问题的时机没有成熟。对方不放弃从所谓的“实力地位”同我们进行谈判的念头。
    我应当再一次坦率地提出警告：谁要从“实力地位”同我们谈判，那末他什么东西也捞不到。
    整个地说，大概暂时不得不推迟日内瓦讨论过的那些问题的解决。好吧，我们愿意等待，我们并不着急。我们将等待好的天气。我们将等待有一天这些问题可以按照人民的利益得到解决。
    我在印度读到一些政府人士评价日内瓦会议结果的言论。我感到满意的是，参加日内瓦会议的人的话是有分寸的。这说明，他们显然不愿意在现在放纵感情，使国际局势尖锐化。
    我要结束我的讲话了。共处是必需的。我们并不请求和乞求它，但是我们在实际上是存在着，就像资本主义国家实际存在着一样。谁也没法使我们搬到火星上去，而且科学家还没有想出这样的办法。显然，资本主义国家也不愿意搬到火星上去。
  （会场活跃）这就是说，我们不得不生活在一个地球上。而生活，也就是共处。
    在这种情况下，问题就是要制止侵略势力发动新的战争。
    你们协会的工作是有助于解决和平共处的问题的。我们愈是互相很好地了解，我们愈是密切合作，愈是互相帮助，那末，和平力量就愈加强大，这也就会约束侵略势力。因为侵略者是不会改变他们的侵略恶习的，只有用积极行动，用各国人民争取和平的积极斗争才能约束他们。（掌声）
    我建议为在座的所有人，为一切朝这个方向竭力工作的人干杯。朋友们，我建议为友谊和你们的健康干杯。（暴风雨般的经久不息的掌声）
