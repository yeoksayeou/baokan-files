　　Universal Good Harvests on Heilongjiang Mechanical Farms

　　The nineteen state-owned mechanical farms in Heilongjiang Province have achieved universal good harvests of soybeans, wheat, and other crops this year, and are expected to turn over a profit of four million yuan to the state.

　　The yields of soybeans and wheat sown on more than 73,000 hectares by state-owned mechanical farms have generally exceeded this year's plan and last year's output. The average wheat yield per hectare in state-owned farms such as Keshan, Nenjiang, and "Jiusan" reached 1,700 kilograms, setting a record high for state-owned farms in Heilongjiang Province. The production costs of soybeans and wheat in various farms have also been reduced this year. The state-owned Tongbei Farm reduced soybean costs by more than 21,000 yuan in the summer cultivation stage alone.

　　Due to increased yields and reduced costs, various farms have obtained more profits this year. The state-owned "Jiusan" Farm gained a profit of 1.1 million yuan from wheat alone this year. State-owned farms such as Tongbei, Erlongshan, and Hongxing, which used to suffer frequent losses, also earned a profit of 950,000 yuan from wheat this year. (Gong Wanzhong)

　  黑龙江机械农场普遍丰收
    黑龙江省十九个国营机械农场今年大豆、小麦等作物普遍丰收，预计可向国家上缴利润四百万元。
    今年国营机械农场播种的七万三千多垧大豆、小麦，产量普遍超过了今年计划和去年的产量。克山、嫩江、“九三”等国营农场每垧小麦平均产量达一千七百公斤，创造了黑龙江省国营农场的最高纪录。今年各农场的大豆、小麦生产成本也有所降低，国营通北农场仅夏锄阶段就降低了大豆成本二万一千多元。
    由于产量提高、成本降低，各农场今年都获得了较多的利润。国营“九三”农场今年单小麦一项就获得一百十万元的利润。过去经常亏损的通北、二龙山、红星等国营农场，今年小麦也获得九十五万元的利润。　（宫万钟）
