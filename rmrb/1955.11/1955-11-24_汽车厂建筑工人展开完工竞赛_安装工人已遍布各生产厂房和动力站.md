Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, November 23rd: Construction workers at the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant are working day and night to accelerate the final stages of construction by launching a labor competition.

Currently, thirty-seven youth shock brigades and hundreds of production teams on the construction site are engaged in a fervent completion competition both inside and outside the three workshops where construction is nearing completion. Zhang Fu's shock brigade in construction area 106 prepares for work more than twenty minutes early each shift, and continues to lay floors and apply asphalt during lunch breaks. As a result, they consistently overfulfill their construction tasks. Ni Zhanjiu, a tinsmith in the shock brigade of construction area 109, invented a folding machine that increased the efficiency of folding sheet metal by nineteen times. This has significantly contributed to the early completion of the plant's ventilation equipment installation tasks.

Construction workers building the foundry, motorcycle, and body pressing workshops are carrying out final civil engineering construction tasks such as laying the floor and pouring equipment foundations at night in order to create construction conditions for the busy installation work. Crane operators working on the body pressing workshop construction site also participated in voluntary labor on Sundays to help the installation department install the steel beam foundations for large stamping equipment. The installation department originally requested that they install the steel beam foundations for four presses in early November, but they completed eleven, thereby accelerating the installation progress of a large number of presses.

All the excavators, scrapers, and bulldozers in the machinery supply station have now been fully deployed, working day and night. Skilled special machinery operators are determined to remove the piles of waste soil, resembling small mountains, from the factory area and fill in the deep pits before the ground completely freezes.

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, November 23rd: The three workshops where equipment installation started last at the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant – the motorcycle workshop, the foundry workshop, and the body pressing workshop – have now launched large-scale installation work.

As more and more civil construction workers withdraw from the site, a large number of installation workers have spread throughout the various production workshops and most of the power stations of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant. In the seven workshops where installation work started earlier, such as the chassis workshop, most of the equipment has now been installed. Inside these workshops, installation workers are continuing to install the remaining machines.

Following the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant's power center – the thermal power station – sending out heat and electricity, the factory's other two power stations – the gas station and the air compression station – have also had a large amount of equipment installed and are about to send out gas and compressed air.

### 汽车厂建筑工人展开完工竞赛　安装工人已遍布各生产厂房和动力站

　　汽车厂建筑工人展开完工竞赛
　　安装工人已遍布各生产厂房和动力站
    新华社长春二十三日电　第一汽车制造厂的建筑工人，正在夜以继日地展开劳动竞赛加速结尾工程的施工。
    现在，工地上的三十七个青年突击队和几百个生产小组，正在建筑工程快要收尾的三个厂房内外展开热火朝天的完工竞赛。一零六工区张福突击队每次上班前都提前二十多分钟作好施工准备，中午下班休息时还在铺地板、刷沥青。因此他们连续超额完成施工任务。一零九工区突击队的白铁工倪占久创造了一种折角机，把摺铁皮的效率提高了十九倍。这对提前完成全厂的通风设备安装任务起了显著作用。
    建设铸工、摩托、车身压制等工场的建筑工人，为给繁忙的安装工程创造施工条件，把打地坪、浇灌设备基础等土木建筑结尾工程都放到夜间去进行。建设车身压制场工场的起重组工人们还在星期日参加义务劳动来帮助安装部门安装大型冲压设备的钢梁基础。安装部门原来要求他们在十一月上旬安装四台压力机钢梁基础，结果完成了十一台，因而加快了大批压力机的安装进度。
    机械供应站里的掘土机、铲运机和推土机，现在已经全部出动，日夜工作。熟练的特种机械操使者，决定在大地完全封冻之前，把厂区里一堆一堆像小山一样的弃土移去，并且填平深坑。
    新华社长春二十三日电　在第一汽车制造厂的许多工场中最后开始安装设备的三个工场——摩托工场、铸工场、车身压制工场，现在已经展开大量的安装工作。
    随着土木建筑工人愈来愈多的退出现场，大批安装工人已经布满了第一汽车制造厂的各个生产厂房和大部分动力站。安装工程开始较早的底盘工场等七个工场，现在大部分的设备已经安装起来。在这些厂房内，安装工人们还在继续安装着未安装完的机器。
    随着第一汽车制造厂的动力中心——热电站送出热和电以后，这个工厂的另外两座动力站——煤气站和空气压缩站也已经安装了大量的设备，快要送出煤气和压缩空气了。
