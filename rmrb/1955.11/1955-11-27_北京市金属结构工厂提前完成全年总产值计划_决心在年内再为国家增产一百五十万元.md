    Beijing Metal Structure Factory Completes Annual Gross Output Value Plan Ahead of Schedule
　  Determined to Increase Production for the Country by Another 1.5 Million Yuan Within the Year
    To the Editor:
    Our factory completed the state-assigned annual gross output value plan 69 days ahead of schedule on October 23rd. All employees of the factory have proposed a goal of increasing production for the country by another 1.5 million yuan within the year. This year, our factory's production plan has increased by 39% compared to last year; the product quality has also greatly improved compared to last year.
    Improving production management is the key to our early completion of the plan. In the past, the production order in our factory was very chaotic. For example, in workshops with a small number of people, there were three levels of leadership: workshop director, section chief, and production team leader, which resulted in unclear responsibilities and a lack of communication between upper and lower levels. This year, we eliminated the section chief level. This not only strengthened leadership work but also enabled more than 50 senior technicians who were originally engaged in administrative work to directly participate in production, giving full play to their production technology capabilities. Furthermore, in the past, machinists and fitters, riveters and welders were organized into separate workshops, which resulted in very uncoordinated work, often causing idle labor and uneven workloads. This year, the entire factory reorganized the workshops based on the type of work and production relationships, and also made unified adjustments and arrangements for the labor force, enabling most workers to have fixed work positions and production tasks, reducing idle labor and unnecessary worker mobility. The departments managing and leading production have strengthened pre-production preparation, and by the 25th of each month, they can issue the control figures for the next month's production to each workshop, enabling the workshops to arrange production as early as possible.
    Submitting the state plan to the workers for discussion and stimulating their enthusiasm for labor is also an important factor in completing the plan ahead of schedule. After most production teams grasped their own plans, they enthusiastically launched labor competitions. For example, in September, to welcome National Day, the labor productivity of all workers in the factory increased by 16%; young worker Zhao Yuemin used old machines to modify the threading machine, increasing work efficiency by more than four times. Most of our factory's work is done outdoors, and we are forced to stop work when encountering strong winds and heavy rain, but we also overfulfilled the production task during the rainy season in August. We deeply realize that when workers grasp the production plan and further establish the idea of ​​"being the masters of the house," they will find ways to overcome various difficulties!
    Although our factory has completed this year's production tasks, we will never be complacent. All employees of the factory are full of confidence to welcome a higher state plan next year!

### 北京市金属结构工厂提前完成全年总产值计划  决心在年内再为国家增产一百五十万元

    北京市金属结构工厂提前完成全年总产值计划
　  决心在年内再为国家增产一百五十万元编辑同志：
    我们工厂在十月二十三日提前六十九天完成了国家规定的全年总产值计划，全厂职工提出了在年内为国家再增产一百五十万元的奋斗目标。今年我厂的生产计划比去年提高了百分之三十九；产品质量也比去年大大提高了。
    改善生产管理是我们提前完成计划的关键。过去，我们厂里的生产秩序非常混乱。例如人数不多的车间，都设有车间主任、工段段长、生产组长三级领导，这就造成了职责不明和上下不通气的情况。今年我们就取消了工段段长这一级。这样，不但领导工作加强了，并且还使五十多名原来担任行政工作的高级技术工人直接参加生产，发挥了生产技术效能。又如，过去机工和钳工，铆工和焊工都是分别成立车间，结果在工作上很不协调，经常发生窝工和忙闲不均的现象。今年全厂根据工种和生产关系重新组织了车间，对劳动力也作了统一调配和安排，使大部分工人有了固定的工作岗位和生产任务，减少了工人窝工和不必要的流动。管理和领导生产的科室，由于加强了生产前的准备工作，在每月二十五日就可以下达各车间下月生产的控制数字，使车间能够及早地安排生产。
    把国家计划交给工人讨论，启发他们的劳动热情，也是使计划提前完成的重要因素。大部分生产小组在掌握了自己的计划以后，就热烈地展开了劳动竞赛。例如，九月份为了迎接国庆节，全厂工人的劳动生产率提高了百分之十六；青年工人赵悦民利用废旧的机器，改装了套扣机，提高工作效率四倍多。我们工厂大部分工作是露天操作的，遇到大风大雨就要被迫停工，但是我们在八月的雨季里也超额完成了生产任务。我们深深体会到，当工人们掌握了生产计划，进一步树立了“当家作主”的思想，他们就会设法克服各种困难！
    我们工厂虽然完成了今年的生产任务，但是我们决不自满。全厂职工满怀信心迎接明年更高额的国家计划！
