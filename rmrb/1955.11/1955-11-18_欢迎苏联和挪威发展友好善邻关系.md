    Welcome the Development of Friendly and Good-Neighborly Relations between the Soviet Union and Norway

    The talks between the governments of the Soviet Union and Norway were successfully concluded on November 15. During the talks, the two sides exchanged views on the development of Soviet-Norwegian relations and certain international issues of interest to both countries, and reached a number of agreements. The successful outcome of the talks has brought Soviet-Norwegian relations into a new stage, which not only conforms to the interests of the people of both the Soviet Union and Norway, but also strengthens peace in Europe and is conducive to the easing of international tensions.

    As everyone knows, the Soviet Union and Norway are two neighboring countries that share a border. Historically, the people of these two countries have lived in harmony and have never had a military conflict. The heroic actions of the Soviet army in liberating northern Norway during World War II further promoted the friendship between the people of the two countries. The Soviet Union's consistent pursuit of a peaceful and friendly policy towards Norway has been fully understood and approved by the broad masses of the Norwegian people. Therefore, there is obviously a good foundation for maintaining good-neighborly relations between the Soviet Union and Norway. However, since the war, international aggressor forces have tried every means to provoke relations between Norway and the Soviet Union, attempting to turn Norway into their outpost for aggression against the Soviet Union. Therefore, for the sake of peace and the vital interests of both the Soviet Union and Norway, both countries demand further consolidation of their friendly and good-neighborly relations.

    The positive results achieved in the Soviet-Norwegian talks are another achievement of the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy. In the past year, the Soviet Union has made a series of efforts to improve and strengthen its relations with many countries, based on the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity. The restoration and development of friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, the strengthening of friendly relations between the Soviet Union and India and Burma, the further consolidation of friendly cooperation between the Soviet Union and Finland, and the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany, all vividly demonstrate that the Soviet Union is faithful to its policy of peaceful coexistence and the promotion of trust between countries. Now, the leaders of the Soviet and Norwegian governments have held talks in an atmosphere of friendship and mutual understanding, and both sides have expressed their firm determination to promote friendly and good-neighborly relations between the Soviet Union and Norway. This is another example of peaceful coexistence between countries with different political and social systems. The argument that countries with different political and social systems cannot coexist peacefully is obviously motivated by ulterior motives and is groundless.

    In recent years, Norway's ties with the Soviet Union in the economic, cultural, and other fields have been strengthened. Norway's trade volume with the Soviet Union has increased year by year. Trade between the two countries on an equal and mutually beneficial basis has brought benefits to both countries. In these talks, the Soviet Union and Norway expressed their willingness to further develop Soviet-Norwegian trade and other economic ties on a fully reciprocal basis, and signed two new commodity exchange protocols. Economic ties between the two countries will undoubtedly become closer. The agreements reached by both sides on strengthening cultural exchanges and other aspects will play an important role in further promoting mutual understanding and cooperation between the people of the Soviet Union and Norway.

    What is particularly noteworthy and welcome is that Prime Minister Gerhardsen gave assurances to the Soviet Union: "The Norwegian government will not encourage policies that pursue aggressive aims, and, unless Norway is attacked or threatened with attack, will not provide bases on Norwegian territory to foreign armed forces." It should be pointed out that this assurance from the head of the Norwegian government reflects the Norwegian people's desire for peace and friendship with the Soviet Union. It is in line with the interests of ensuring Norway's security and will greatly strengthen mutual trust between the Soviet Union and Norway, thereby helping to consolidate peace in Northern Europe.

### 欢迎苏联和挪威发展友好善邻关系

    欢迎苏联和挪威发展友好善邻关系
    苏联和挪威两国政府之间的会谈已于十一月十五日圆满结束。在会谈中，双方就发展苏挪两国关系问题以及有关两国利益的某些国际问题交换了意见，并达成了多项的协议。会谈的圆满结果使苏挪两国的关系进入一个新的阶段，这不仅符合于苏挪两国人民的利益，而且加强了欧洲的和平，有利于国际紧张局势的缓和。
    大家知道，苏联和挪威是两个互相接壤的邻国。在历史上，这两个国家的人民一向和睦相处，从来没有发生过军事冲突。苏联军队在第二次世界大战中解放挪威北部的英勇行动，更促进了两国人民的友谊。苏联一贯奉行爱好和平和对挪威友好的政策，得到挪威广大人民的充分了解和赞同。因此，苏联和挪威两国维持善邻的关系显然是有着良好的基础的。但是战后以来，国际侵略势力却千方百计地想挑拨挪威和苏联之间的关系，企图把挪威变成他们侵略苏联的前哨。因此，为了和平利益和苏挪两国的切身利益，两国都要求进一步巩固彼此间的友好善邻关系。
    苏挪会谈所取得的积极结果，是苏联和平外交政策的又一成就。最近一年来，苏联本着互相尊重主权、独立和领土不受侵犯的原则，进行了一系列的努力来改善和加强它同许多国家的关系。苏联同南斯拉夫友好关系的恢复和发展，苏联同印度、缅甸的友好关系的加强，苏联同芬兰的友好合作的进一步巩固以及苏联同德意志联邦共和国外交关系的建立，都生动地表明，苏联是忠实于它所主张的和平共处和促进国与国之间的信任的政策的。现在苏联同挪威政府的领导人员在友好和相互谅解的气氛中进行了会谈，双方并表示了坚定不移的决心，要促进苏联和挪威两国之间的友好善邻关系。这是政治和社会制度不同的国家和平共处的又一范例，那种硬说政治和社会制度不同的国家不可能和平共处的论调，显然是别有用心和毫无根据的。
    近年来，挪威同苏联在经济、文化等各方面的联系，都有所加强。挪威对苏联的贸易额逐年在增加。两国在平等互利基础上进行的贸易，给两国都带来了好处。在这次会谈中，苏联和挪威双方表示愿意在完全互惠的基础上进一步发展苏挪贸易和其他经济联系，并签订了两项新的换货议定书。两国之间的经济联系无疑将会更加密切起来。双方在加强文化交流和其他方面达成的协议，对于进一步促进苏挪两国人民的互相谅解和合作将起重要的作用。
    特别值得重视和欢迎的是，基哈德森首相对苏联作出保证：“挪威政府将不鼓励追求侵略目的的政策，而且，只要挪威不遭到攻击或者遭到攻击的威胁，将不在挪威领土上向外国武装力量提供基地。”应当指出，挪威政府首脑的这种保证，反映了挪威人民要求和平和对苏联友好的愿望。它符合于保证挪威安全的利益，并将大大加强苏挪两国的相互信任，从而有助于巩固北欧的和平。
