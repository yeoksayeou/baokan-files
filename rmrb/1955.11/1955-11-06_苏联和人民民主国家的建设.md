    Soviet Union Reclaims 450 Million Mu of Wasteland
    From the spring of 1954 to October 31 this year, Soviet agricultural laborers have achieved a great victory on the wasteland reclamation front. They have reclaimed a total of more than 30.01 million hectares (approximately 450.15 million mu) of virgin and fallow land in the eastern and southeastern regions. The grand plan formulated by the Communist Party and government of the Soviet Union in 1954 to reclaim 28 million to 30 million hectares of wasteland by 1956 has been completed ahead of schedule and exceeded. The newly reclaimed land is larger than the total wheat planting area of the United States and more than twice the total wheat planting area of France, French Morocco, Australia, and Argentina combined. A total of 424 new and giant state-owned grain farms have been established on these newly reclaimed lands.
    The newly reclaimed land in the Soviet Union has begun to bring huge economic benefits to agriculture, especially grain production. In 1954, Siberia, one of the main reclamation areas in the Soviet Union, due to the reclamation of a large amount of wasteland and the increase in the unit area yield of grain, the total grain output of the entire region has doubled compared to 1953. In the future, after all the 30 million hectares of newly reclaimed land in the Soviet Union are sown with grain, according to conservative estimates, even if the average yield is only 61 poods of grain per hectare (15 mu), at least 1.8361 billion poods of grain can be harvested each year.

    Poland's Chemical Fertilizer Production Increases Fourfold Compared to Pre-War
    Poland's chemical fertilizer production this year has increased more than fourfold compared to before liberation.
    Many large-scale fertilizer factories are under construction and expansion. The country's largest Kędzierzyn nitrogen fertilizer factory, since it partially went into production last year, currently produces one-third of the country's total nitrogen fertilizer output. The factory is currently installing equipment for the third and fourth nitrogen units, and the fifth and sixth nitrogen units are also under construction. In a few years, it will produce half of Poland's total nitrogen fertilizer output.
    The installation of superphosphate granulation equipment at a phosphate fertilizer factory in Szczecin, northwest Poland, is in its final stages. A fertilizer factory is also under construction in Poznań, western Poland. This factory will manufacture fertilizer using a new method invented by Polish scientists. This method involves sintering phosphorus-containing raw materials with a mixture of magnesium, without using sulfuric acid or soda ash, which are usually used in the manufacture of fertilizer.

    Czechoslovakia's Electricity Production Per Capita Exceeds France and Italy
    Czechoslovakia's total electricity production this year will increase to approximately 15 billion kilowatt-hours. Calculated on a per capita basis, each resident receives far more electricity than in France and Italy, reaching more than 1,150 kilowatt-hours.
    In the ten years since liberation, Czechoslovakia has attached great importance to the development of the electricity industry. During the first Five-Year Plan (1949-1953), twelve new power stations were built and started generating electricity. By the end of 1953, the country's total power generation had increased from 4.1 billion kilowatt-hours in 1937 before liberation to 12.4 billion kilowatt-hours. In 1954, the Slapy Hydropower Station, newly built on the Vltava River in western Czechoslovakia, was completed and started generating electricity. Currently, the Orlík Hydropower Station, which has twice the power generation capacity of the Slapy Hydropower Station, is under construction on this river, and a power system consisting of more than a dozen hydropower stations is also under construction on the Vag River in the east.
    In order to meet the needs of various sectors of the national economy for electricity, the National Conference of Power Industry Workers, recently held in Prague, put forward a huge task for the electricity industry: during the second Five-Year Plan from 1956 to 1960, the total power generation capacity of newly built thermal and hydroelectric power stations in Czechoslovakia will be 2.3 million kilowatts, which will ensure that the country's electricity production can increase to 27 billion kilowatt-hours by 1960.

    Hungarian Farmers Join Production Cooperatives in Large Numbers
    More and more Hungarian working farmers are embarking on the road of collectivization. In September this year, 27,300 people participated in agricultural production cooperatives, twice as many as the number of farmers who joined in August, which is equivalent to the total number of farmers who joined in the first half of this year. Since July, 310 new agricultural production cooperatives have been established, almost three times the number of new cooperatives established in the first half of this year.
    Farmers are enthusiastically joining cooperatives because the collective economy has demonstrated its superiority. This year, agricultural production cooperatives harvested an average of 19 quintals of wheat and 139 quintals of potatoes per hectare, which is 3 quintals and 30 quintals more than individual farmers, respectively. The yields of corn and rye in cooperatives are also much higher than those of individual farmers. The members of the "Megyer-Tészi" agricultural production cooperative in Zala County increased their income this year by double compared to last year, and the cooperative's reserve fund increased by 200,000 forints compared to last year. The income of the "Vörös-Mező" agricultural production cooperative in Tapolca region is 70,000 to 80,000 forints more than the original plan this year.

    苏联和人民民主国家的建设
    苏联已开垦荒地四亿五千万亩
    从一九五四年春季起到今年十月三十一日为止，苏联农业劳动者在垦荒战线上取得了一个伟大的胜利，他们在东部和东南部地区总共已经开垦了三千零一十多万公顷（约合四亿五千一百五十多万市亩）生荒地和熟荒地。苏联共产党和政府在一九五四年制定的到一九五六年开垦二千八百万到三千万公顷荒地的庞大计划，已经提前并且超额完成。这些开垦出来的荒地比美国全国的小麦播种面积还要大，等于法国、法属摩洛哥、澳大利亚和阿根廷四个国家小麦播种面积的总和的两倍以上。这些新垦地上总共已经建立了四百二十四个新的巨大的国营谷物农场。
    苏联的新垦地已经开始为农业、特别是谷物生产带来了巨大的经济利益。一九五四年，苏联的主要开垦区之一西伯利亚由于开垦了大量的荒地和提高了谷物的单位面积产量，全区谷物总产量已经增加到一九五三年的两倍。将来，苏联的三千多万公顷的新垦地全部播种谷物以后，据保守的估计，就算每公顷（合十五市亩）平均只出产六十一普特的谷物（每普特合三十二点七六市斤），每年也最少可以收获十八亿三千六百一十万普特的谷物。
    波化学肥料增到战前的四倍
    波兰今年化学肥料的产量已经增加到解放前的四倍以上了。
    许多大规模的肥料工厂正在建设和扩建中。全国最大的肯杰仁氮肥工厂自从去年局部投入生产以后，目前生产的氮肥已经占全国氮肥总产量的三分之一。这个工厂现在正在进行第三和第四氮气部的设备安装工作，第五和第六氮气部也在建设中。几年以后，它生产的氮肥将占波兰全国氮肥产量的一半。
    波兰西北部的斯才新一个磷肥工厂的过磷酸盐粒化设备的安装工作已经进入最后阶段。波兰西部的波兹南也在建设一座肥料工厂。这个工厂将按照波兰科学家发明的一种新方法制造肥料。这种方法就是把含磷原料同镁的混合物放在一起烧结，不必用通常制造肥料时使用的硫酸或者纯碱做原料。
    捷电力生产按人口平均超过法国和意大利
    捷克斯洛伐克今年的电力总产量将增加到约一百五十亿度。按全国人口平均计算，每个居民所得的电力远远超过法国和意大利的水平，而达到一千一百五十多度。
    在解放以来的十年中，捷克斯洛伐克很重视电力工业的发展。在第一个五年计划（一九四九—一九五三年）期间建成并且开始发电的新电力站就有十二个。到一九五三年年底，全国的发电总量已经从解放前一九三七年的四十一亿度增加到了一百二十四亿度。一九五四年，捷克斯洛伐克西部弗尔塔瓦河上新建的斯拉皮水电站落成并且开始发电。目前，这条河流上正在建设一个发电能力比斯拉皮水电站大两倍的奥利克水电站，东部的发格河上也在建设由十几个水电站组成的电力系统。
    为了适应国民经济各部门对于电力的需要，不久以前在布拉格举行的全国动力工业工人会议，给电力工业提出了巨大的任务：在一九五六年到一九六零年的第二个五年计划期间，捷克斯洛伐克全国新建的火力和水力发电站的总发电能力，就将有二百三十万瓩，这样就可以保证全国的电力生产到一九六零年时能增加到二百七十亿度。
    匈农民纷纷加入生产合作社
    匈牙利劳动农民走上合作化道路的越来越多。今年九月间，参加农业生产合作社的有两万七千三百人，比八月份入社农民多一倍，相当于今年上半年入社农民的总数。自从七月到现在已经建立了三百一十个新的农业生产合作社，差不多等于今年上半年新建社数的三倍。
    农民踊跃加入合作社是由于集体经济显示了自己的优越性。今年，农业生产合作社每公顷土地平均收获十九公担小麦，一百三十九公担马铃薯，分别比个体农民多三公担和三十公担。合作社玉蜀黍和黑麦的产量也比个体农民高得多。萨拉州的“梅吉尔台西”农业生产合作社社员今年的收入比去年增加了一倍，合作社的公积金比去年增加了二十万福林。塔波利茨地方的“维莱西·梅柴”农业生产合作社今年的收入比原定计划多七、八万福林。
    蒙古加强农牧业生产合作社
    蒙古人民共和国部长会议和蒙古人民革命党中央委员会发表了关于在组织上和经济上加强农牧业生产合作社的决议。决议中指出，现在，共和国共有两百四十个农牧业生产合作社。这些合作社中的公有牲畜总头数为一百九十万头。
    决议中拟定了关于增加牲畜总头数和提高牲畜产品生产率以及关于在组织上加强农牧业生产合作社和关于改善合作社社员的文化生活条件的具体措施。
    按照这个决议，在最近几年中将大大增加饲料的储备，增加建筑畜圈和水井以及添置农具的拨款。
