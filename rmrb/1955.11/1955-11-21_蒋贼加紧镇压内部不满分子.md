Xinhua News Agency, 18th. Traitor Chiang Kai-shek is implementing a terrifying "self-cleansing movement" in Taiwan to intensify the suppression of the growing number of dissatisfied elements within the Chiang Kai-shek clique.

According to Taiwan press reports, the purpose of Chiang Kai-shek's so-called "self-cleansing movement" is to "test" the "loyalty" of his subordinates to Chiang Kai-shek. Anyone deemed insufficiently "loyal" will be "thoroughly purged." The reports reveal that Kuomintang "elders" and senior military and government officials, as well as other personnel in Taiwan, are being forced to participate in this terrifying movement led by Chiang Ching-kuo. In addition to filling out the so-called "self-cleansing covenant" and mutually framing "investigation report forms," each person must also undergo a so-called "self-cleansing investigation" and "investigation of relations with the mainland." Chiang Kai-shek also stipulates that everyone must conduct an "analysis of economic potential" of all relatives and friends, to facilitate future extortion by the Chiang Kai-shek clique. Not long ago, Sun Yuanjin, the business manager of the Taiwan Wool Factory, was murdered after refusing to pay a huge sum of money extorted by the Economic Group of Chiang Kai-shek's Taiwan Provincial Security Command and was falsely accused of being a “suspect.”

Chiang Kai-shek's terrifying "self-cleansing movement" is another step after the "Sun Li-jen case" to eliminate internal dissatisfied elements. This step is larger in scale than the reconnaissance and search by Chiang Ching-kuo's secret agents within the Chiang Kai-shek clique this spring to hunt down "anti-Chiang elements and peace advocates," the Chiang Kai-shek's coercion of Kuomintang "elders" in Taiwan this summer to "swear allegiance" and implement "joint guarantee," and the "loyalty investigation" held this autumn. The report says that because the "Sun Li-jen case" exposed the growing dissatisfaction of more and more people within the Chiang Kai-shek clique with Chiang Kai-shek and his son, Chiang Kai-shek and his son decided to launch another "self-cleansing movement" to suppress the dissatisfied elements. However, even the Taiwan press had to admit that Chiang Kai-shek's movement "aroused more widespread dissatisfaction" within his clique, and the internal personnel of the Chiang Kai-shek clique were even more "estranged," "distrustful" and "self-destructive."

### 蒋贼加紧镇压内部不满分子

　　蒋贼加紧镇压内部不满分子
    新华社十八日讯　卖国贼蒋介石正在台湾施行恐怖的“自清运动”，来加紧镇压蒋贼集团内部越来越多的不满分子。
    据台湾报刊消息，蒋贼进行所谓“自清运动”的目的，是“考验”他的手下的人员对蒋贼“是否忠贞”。凡被认为不够“忠贞”的人，都将被“彻底肃清”。消息透露，在台湾的国民党“元老”和高级军政官员以及其他人员，都被迫参加由蒋经国主持的这个恐怖运动。他们除了要填写所谓“自清公约”和互相诬陷的“检肃报告表”外，每人还要遭受所谓“自清调查”和“对大陆关系清查”。蒋贼还规定每人必须对所有的亲属及朋友作“经济潜力之分析”，以便利蒋贼集团今后敲诈勒索。不久以前，台湾毛绒厂业务部经理孙元锦就因为拒绝蒋贼台湾省保安司令部经济组的勒索巨款，而被加上“嫌疑分子”的“罪名”杀害。
    蒋贼恐怖的“自清运动”是在“孙立人案”以后清除内部不满分子的又一步骤。这一步骤比起今年春季蒋经国系特务人员在蒋贼集团内部侦察搜捕
  “反蒋分子及和平人士”，比起今年夏季蒋贼强迫在台湾的国民党“元老”“宣誓效忠”和“连环互保”，比起今年秋季举行的“忠贞调查”等措施，规模都大。消息说，因为“孙立人案”暴露了蒋贼集团内部愈来愈多的人对蒋贼父子不满，因此蒋贼父子决定再来一次“自清运动”，对不满分子进行镇压。但是，连台湾报刊也不得不承认，蒋贼的这个运动在其集团内部“引起的不满情绪”更加普遍，蒋贼集团内部人员更加“离心离德”和“自扰自坏”。
