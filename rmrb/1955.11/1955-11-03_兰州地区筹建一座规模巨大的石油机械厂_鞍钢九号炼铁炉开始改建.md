Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 1st - A huge Lanzhou Petroleum Machinery Plant is being planned and built in the Lanzhou area of Gansu Province. Once completed, this factory will mass-produce complete sets of new petroleum drilling equipment, including large 3,200-meter oil rigs and the latest turbo drills, to meet the needs of the rapid development of China's petroleum exploration.

The design of this factory is very advanced, and the most advanced Soviet technological achievements will be adopted in future production. To ensure product quality, precise automatic control instruments will be installed on various heating equipment, and a well-equipped laboratory will be set up in the factory.

Currently, construction workers are conducting geological exploration, surveying, and pile driving on the factory site. Ground leveling will begin in early November. The construction organization design for nine processing plants, including a prefabrication plant for reinforced concrete structures and a foamed concrete plant, needed for factory-style construction has been completed and will be implemented soon. The preparation unit and the construction unit are studying the technical design of the factory.

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 2nd - Renovation has begun on Anshan Iron and Steel Company's No. 9 Blast Furnace, which will be converted into the fifth automated blast furnace of Anshan Iron and Steel Company. At present, all employees on the construction site are responding to the call for accelerated construction put forward by the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and have decided to strive to overfulfill the plan. This blast furnace will use a high-pressure furnace top and implement high-pressure operation during production, which is another achievement of our country in learning the latest Soviet ironmaking technology. According to current technical conditions, after adopting the high-pressure furnace top, its output will increase by 7 to 8 percent compared with the original design output, and the coke consumption per ton of iron produced can be reduced by about 100 kilograms. The furnace body structure of this blast furnace has been changed to welding by absorbing advanced Soviet technology, which can not only improve quality and save steel, but also accelerate the construction progress.

This high-pressure top blast furnace was designed by the Black Metallurgical Design Institute of the Ministry of Heavy Industry under the guidance of Soviet experts. All equipment is basically manufactured by our own country.

    兰州地区筹建一座规模巨大的石油机械厂
    鞍钢九号炼铁炉开始改建
    新华社兰州一日电　甘肃省兰州地区正在筹建一座规模巨大的兰州石油机械厂。这个工厂建成后，将大量生产成套的新式石油钻探设备，其中包括三千二百公尺的大型石油钻机和最新式的涡轮钻具等，以供应我国石油勘探事业迅速发展的需要。
    这个工厂的设计是很先进的，在将来的生产中将采用苏联最先进的技术成就。为了保证产品质量，在各种加热设备上都将装有精密的自动化控制仪表，厂内并将设有设备完善的试验室。
    现在，建筑工人们正在厂区进行施工钻探、测量和定桩工作。十一月初将开始平整厂地。为工厂化施工需要的钢筋混凝土结构预制厂、泡沫混凝土厂等九个加工厂的施工组织设计已编制好了，很快就要施工。筹建单位和施工单位正在学习这个工厂的技术设计。
    新华社鞍山二日电　鞍山钢铁公司九号炼铁炉已开始改建，它将被改建成为鞍山钢铁公司的第五座自动化炼铁炉。目前，工地上的全体职工，正响应中共鞍山市委提出的加速建设的号召，决定争取超额完成计划。这座炼铁炉将采用高压炉顶，生产时实行高压操作，这是我国学习苏联最新炼铁技术的又一成就。根据当前技术条件，在采用高压炉顶后，它的产量比原设计产量提高百分之七到八，每炼一吨铁所消耗的焦炭可减少一百公斤左右。这座炼铁炉的炉体结构由于吸取苏联先进技术改为焊接，不仅能提高质量，节约钢材，还可加速施工进度。
    这座高压炉顶的炼铁炉，是重工业部黑色冶金设计院在苏联专家指导下设计的。全部设备基本上由我国自己制造。
