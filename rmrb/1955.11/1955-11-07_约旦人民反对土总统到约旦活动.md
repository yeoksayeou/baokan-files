Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, November 5th: According to TASS, Turkish President Bayar arrived in Jordan on November 3rd. Beirut sources believe that Bayar's visit to Jordan is an attempt by the Turkish authorities to drag Jordan into the Turkish-Iraqi military bloc.

According to the "Flag" newspaper, strict security measures have been taken in Amman to prevent anti-Turkish demonstrations during Bayar's stay in Jordan. If the measures taken by the police station are not enough, the authorities even intend to declare a national curfew.

The newspaper emphasized that most Jordanian people oppose the Turkish President's visit.

    约旦人民反对土总统到约旦活动
    新华社五日讯  据塔斯社贝鲁特四日讯：土耳其总统拜亚尔在十一月三日到达约旦。贝鲁特人士认为拜亚尔访问约旦是土耳其当局想把约旦拖入土耳其—伊拉克军事集团的一种企图。
    据“旗帜报”报道，安曼市已经采取了森严的警戒措施，以防拜亚尔停留在约旦期间有反对土耳其的示威事件发生。如果警察局所采取的措施还不够的话，当局甚至还打算宣布全国戒严。
    报纸强调指出，大多数约旦人民反对土耳其总统的访问。
