    Ways to Change "Sitting at the Door Waiting for Customers"
    Hengdian Town is a central market town in Dongyang County, Zhejiang Province. Recently, on every market day, thousands of farmers come to buy daily necessities and production materials and sell agricultural and sideline products. The entrance of the supply and marketing cooperative is very crowded. Farmers often have to spend a lot of time buying or selling things, and the two salespersons of the cooperative are overwhelmed, and the farmers also have many opinions. Therefore, the supply and marketing cooperative, based on this situation, absorbed some small merchants and peddlers as purchasing and sales agents of the supply and marketing cooperative, and designated areas for their activities. On the one hand, they delivered farmers' daily necessities and production materials to the countryside, and on the other hand, they purchased agricultural and sideline products.
    This approach is very popular with farmers, achieving three benefits at once: it gave play to the enthusiasm of small merchants and peddlers in rural commercial activities; it met the needs of farmers and saved them manpower and time; and it overcame the phenomenon of the supply and marketing cooperative being overly busy.
    With the bumper harvest, the rural peak season has arrived. This is a new situation. Rural supply and marketing cooperatives should not continue to "sit at the door waiting for customers". They should come up with new methods based on the new situation and deepen their activities into the countryside!

    改变“坐门待客”的办法
    横店镇是浙江东阳县的一个中心集镇，近来每逢集日，购买生活资料和生产资料及出卖农副产品的农民成千上万，供销合作社的门口十分拥挤。农民们常常要花很多时间，才能买到或者卖出东西，合作社的两个营业员忙得不可开交，农民们也有很多意见。于是，供销社就根据这种情况，吸收了一些小商小贩作为供销社的代购代销员，并给他们划定活动的地区，一面把农民的生活资料和生产资料送到农村去，一面又把农副产品收购回来。
    这样的做法大受农民欢迎，做到了一举三得：发挥了小商小贩在农村商业活动中的积极性；满足了农民的需要，还为他们节约了人力和时间；克服了供销社过分忙乱的现象。
    随着丰收，农村的旺季已经到来，这是一种新情况，农村的供销社不应该继续“坐门待客”，应该根据新情况，想出新办法，把自己的活动深入到农村去！
