　　Massively Promote New Agricultural Tools
To the Editors:
    Our Shandong Province Guanxian Supply and Marketing Cooperative Union is actively doing a good job in supplying new agricultural tools to support the agricultural cooperation movement. As of mid-October, we have supplied farmers with 883 double-shared plows, reaching 176.6 percent of the annual plan; 494 walking plows, reaching 310 percent of the annual plan.
    According to the survey in early spring this year, the main need for new agricultural tools comes from agricultural production cooperatives. We sent a large number of cadres to sign contracts with many agricultural cooperatives to reserve new agricultural tools by helping them make production plans. Later, we continued to publicize to farmers by checking the contracts, so the actual sales volume greatly exceeded the scheduled figures.
    In the process of promoting new agricultural tools, we paid attention to using the methods of introducing typical cases and calculating increased production, which achieved good results. For example, the Second District Supply and Marketing Cooperative introduced the fact that the Cheng Dianxing Agricultural Cooperative in Baiji last year used double-shared plows to increase grain production by 22 jin per mu at the district-wide agricultural production cooperative director meeting convened by the Party committee. It also pointed out that a double-shared plow used for 30 days a year, plowing at least 8 mu of land per day, can increase grain production by more than 5,000 jin, and can also reduce the use of two cattle and the grass feed for the cattle. This concrete example greatly increased the enthusiasm of agricultural cooperatives to purchase double-shared plows. At this meeting alone, the cooperative directors reported the purchase of 52 double-shared plows and 38 walking plows. The Liuzhuang Wang Zejia Agricultural Production Cooperative bought four double-shared plows in order to rush to plant wheat. The First District Supply and Marketing Cooperative sold 125 walking plows in three days after calculating the increased production account of the Wang Lian Gui Agricultural Production Cooperative using walking plows.
    We also enabled the masses of farmers to see the benefits of using new agricultural tools by imparting technology and organizing on-site visits. During the autumn plowing and wheat planting period alone, the technical cadres of the county's supply and marketing cooperatives, combined with the work of the technical guidance station, successively held 153 technical network and technical agricultural tool users' meetings in different areas, helping the agricultural production cooperatives train more than 3,000 agricultural tool users, and organized visits. For example, at the technical training meeting in Tanggu Township in the First District, three types of plows, old plows, walking plows, and double-shared plows, were organized to plow the land at the same time. The results showed that the old plows could only plow 3.5 inches deep and 5 inches wide, plowing 2.5 mu of land per xiang; the walking plows plowed 6 inches deep and 8 inches wide, plowing 3.5 mu of land per xiang; the double-shared plows plowed 5.5 inches deep and 1.2 chi wide, plowing more than 5 mu of land per xiang. This sharp contrast educated the cooperative directors and technicians of the agricultural production cooperatives about the benefits of new plows. The Third District organized 120 township cadres and agricultural production cooperative directors to visit the Fengzhuang Ma Yunhai Agricultural Production Cooperative to see the use of double-shared plows for plowing, and introduced the fact that this cooperative increased production last year by using double-shared plows. At that time, 96 agricultural production cooperatives reported the purchase of 110 double-shared plows; the Han Zhenhua Cooperative originally bought five, and bought five more after the visit.
    We know that with the development of the agricultural cooperation movement, the demand for new agricultural tools from farmers will become greater and greater. We are determined to further improve our work to meet the requirements of our farmer brothers. We must overcome the shortcomings in our current work, such as conservative planning, the failure of parts repair work to keep up, and neglecting the organizational work of combining with the rural blacksmiths of the handicraft production cooperatives. We will promote new agricultural tools in conjunction with winter plowing.

### 大量推广新式农具

　  大量推广新式农具编辑同志：
    我们山东省冠县供销合作社联合社积极做好新式农具的供应工作，支援农业合作化运动。到十月中旬为止，我们已经供应农民双铧犁八百八十三部，达到全年计划的百分之一百七十六点六；步犁四百九十四部，达到全年计划的百分之三百一十。
    根据今年春初的调查，迫切需要新式农具的，主要是农业生产合作社。我们就派出大批干部，通过帮助农业生产合作社作生产计划的办法同许多农业社订立了预约新式农具的合同。以后，又通过检查合同继续向农民进行宣传，因此实际销售数量就大大超过了预订的数字。
    在推广新式农具的过程中，我们注意运用了介绍典型、算增产账的办法，取得了很好的效果。如第二区供销合作社在党委召开的全区农业生产合作社社长会议上，介绍了白集程佃兴农业社去年用双铧犁耕地每亩增产二十二斤粮食的事实。并且指出一张双铧犁全年使用三十天，每天最少犁地八亩，就可以增产粮食五千多斤，还可以少用两头牛和牛吃的草料。这个具体事例大大提高了农业社购买双铧犁的热情，光在这次会议上各社社长就报买了双铧犁五十二部、步犁三十八张。刘庄王泽甲农业生产合作社为了突击种麦，就买了四张双铧犁。一区供销合作社算了王连桂农业生产合作社使用步犁的增产账后，三天内就销出步犁一百二十五部。
    我们还通过传授技术和组织实地参观，使农民群众看到了使用新式农具的好处。仅在秋耕种麦期间，全县供销合作社的技术干部，结合技术指导站的工作，先后分片召开了一百五十三次技术网和技术农具手的会议，帮助各农业生产合作社训练了农具手三千多人，并且组织了参观。如一区在唐固乡传授技术会议上，组织了旧犁、步犁、双铧犁三种犁同时耕地，结果旧犁只能犁三寸半深、五寸宽，一晌犁地二亩半；步犁犁六寸深、八寸宽，一晌犁三亩半；双铧犁犁五寸五分深、一尺二寸宽，一晌犁五亩多。这个鲜明的对比，教育了各农业生产合作社的社长和技术员认识到新式犁的好处。三区组织了乡干部和农业生产合作社社长一百二十人参观凤庄马云海农业生产合作社用双铧犁犁地，并且介绍了这个社去年用双铧犁耕地增产的事实。当时，就有九十六个农业生产合作社报买双铧犁一百一十部；韩振华社原来买了五部，参观后又买了五部。
    我们知道，随着农业合作化运动的发展，农民对新式农具的需要也就越来越大。我们决心进一步做好工作，来满足农民弟兄的要求。我们要克服目前工作中存在的计划保守、零件修配工作跟不上和忽视同手工业生产社铁炉下乡相结合的组织工作等缺点，结合冬耕推广新式农具。
