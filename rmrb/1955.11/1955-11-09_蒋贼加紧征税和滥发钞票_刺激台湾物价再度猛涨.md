    Chiang Kai-shek Bandit Gang Intensifies Tax Collection and Issues Banknotes Wantonly,
    Stimulating Another Sharp Rise in Taiwan's Prices

    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan is intensifying the collection of commodity taxes, business taxes, and income taxes, causing another sharp rise in prices in Taiwan.
    According to Taiwan newspaper reports, the Chiang bandit Taiwan Provincial Department of Finance announced in mid-October the so-called "revised measures" to intensify tax collection, effective from November 1st, triggering a new wave of price increases in Taiwan. Comparing wholesale prices in Taipei on October 24th with those of ten days prior, "Farmer" brand flour increased from 78 yuan (counterfeit Taiwan dollars, same below) per bag to 82 yuan; “Penglai” white rice increased from 168 yuan to 178 yuan per 100 Taiwan catties (equivalent to 60 kilograms); peanut oil increased from 730 yuan to 770 yuan per 100 Taiwan catties; 12-pound fine cloth increased from 232 yuan to 243 yuan per bolt; the market price of 20-count yarn skyrocketed to 9,500 yuan per piece, exceeding the "price limit" set by the Chiang bandits by one-third.
    In recent days, prices in Taiwan have continued to soar. For example, the wholesale price of “Penglai” white rice in Taipei rose to 191 yuan per 100 Taiwan catties on November 1st, an increase of 13 yuan compared to a week earlier. Flour, oils, vegetables, meat, coal, dried and fresh seafood, canned goods, cotton yarn, cloth, woolen and linen textiles, rubber products, leather, chemical raw materials, hardware, electrical appliances, building materials, Chinese and Western medicines, paper stationery, and so on, are all increasing rapidly in price.
    The report says that the Chiang bandits' indiscriminate printing of banknotes, which has devalued the counterfeit Taiwan dollar, is also one of the reasons for the continued soaring of prices in Taiwan.

    蒋贼加紧征税和滥发钞票
    刺激台湾物价再度猛涨
    新华社讯　蒋介石卖国集团在台湾加紧征收货物税、营业税和所得税，使台湾物价再度猛涨。
    据台湾报纸消息，蒋贼台湾省财政厅在十月中旬宣布从十一月一日起实行加紧征税的所谓“修正办法”，掀起了台湾物价的新涨风。以台北市十月二十四日批发价和十天前比较，“农夫”牌面粉每袋由七十八元（伪台币，下同）涨到八十二元；蓬莱白米每一百台斤（合六十公斤）由一百六十八元涨到一百七十八元；花生油每一百台斤由七百三十元涨到七百七十元；十二磅细布每匹由二百三十二元涨到二百四十三元；二十支纱市价每件暴涨到九千五百元，超出蒋贼规定的“限价”三分之一。
    连日来，台湾物价仍在飞涨中。如台北市蓬莱白米批发价在十一月一日每一百台斤涨到一百九十一元，比一个星期前又涨了十三元。面粉、油类、菜蔬、肉类、煤炭、南北货海产、罐头、棉纱、布匹、毛麻织品、橡胶制品、皮革、化工原料、五金、电器、建筑材料、中西药品、纸张文具等等，也都在急剧涨价中。
    消息说，蒋贼滥印钞票，使伪台币贬值，也是台湾物价继续飞涨的原因之一。
