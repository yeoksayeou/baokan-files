    The Key Lies in Understanding the Needs of the Rural Market
    Kong Sang
    Since the beginning of the peak season, many rural markets in various regions have generally experienced a shortage of industrial goods. Now, the Party committees and government departments in some areas have begun to pay attention to this issue, holding emergency meetings, organizing internal material exchanges between state-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives, organizing grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives to deliver goods to the countryside, and utilizing local ancient fairs and temple fairs to organize material exchanges. These measures have brought about some changes in the rural supply work in some areas.
    In many areas, when industrial products are displayed and meet the farmers, it is found that the farmers' need for industrial products is very urgent. They want to buy more this year than they bought in previous years, and they want to buy earlier this year than they bought in previous years. Even goods that are somewhat out of season are needed by the farmers. For example, a sales department of a supply and marketing cooperative in the third district of Yucheng County, Shandong Province, sold nine cool mats in one day on October 25th, and long-stocked mosquito net cloth was also sold out. In the sales department of the supply and marketing cooperative in Yaozhan, the fifth district of Pingyuan, a farmer spent more than 30 yuan to buy a woolen blanket. Flying Pigeon brand bicycles sell very well in cotton-producing areas, and some people also buy imported bicycles. This shows that the purchasing power in rural areas is very high this year.
    Under this new situation, some staff members of the supply and marketing cooperatives have developed a new idea: originally, everything sold well in the rural market this year, the farmers' purchasing power is high, and whatever is available can be sold, but they have no idea what the farmers actually need. They did not think of the old saying "If you have money, don't buy for half a year of idleness." Farmers buying summer supplies in winter shows that the supply work of the supply and marketing cooperatives is not done well. Because the thick flannel clothing, good white cloth, printed cloth scraps, student blue cloth, as well as iron pots, steamers, and small vats that farmers urgently need are out of stock in the supply and marketing cooperatives, they have to buy some out-of-season goods or expensive goods that are not needed for the time being. Logically speaking, in this situation, the staff of the supply and marketing cooperatives should quickly study why farmers want to buy these goods, what they actually need, and immediately purchase and supply goods according to specific needs. However, they do not do this. Most of the supply and marketing cooperatives vigorously promote inventory goods, and still adopt a conservative approach to purchasing, believing that the present is a good opportunity to promote stockpiled goods; in some individual areas, the supply and marketing cooperatives, seeing that expensive goods also sell well, began to blindly purchase high-end goods such as Chunghwa cigarettes and large quantities of leather coats.
    This practice of commercial staff not understanding, analyzing, and researching market needs and operating blindly is the main reason for not being able to meet rural supply. They did not realize that the main task of socialist commercial workers is to ensure the supply of the people's growing production and living needs. To achieve this, they must deeply understand the growth of farmers' purchasing power, the new changes in farmers' needs after rural cooperativization and harvest, and then quickly and actively purchase marketable goods according to the specific needs of farmers. Commercial staff should not only deeply understand the needs of farmers, but more importantly, guide consumption. Especially now that the living standards of the vast number of farmers are still quite low, and some even lack daily necessities and small sundry goods, they need to add various kinds of means of livelihood and means of production. Therefore, only by introducing commodities to farmers in a timely manner, guiding their consumption, and actively organizing the supply of marketable commodities can we ensure supply and accelerate capital turnover. Any attempt to reduce stockpiling and eliminate out-of-stock phenomena by simply compressing inventories and promoting out-of-season goods, or by blindly purchasing expensive goods to accelerate capital turnover, without studying objective needs, is not only detrimental to meeting the needs of farmers and completing the sales plan of the supply and marketing cooperatives.
    The rural market will enter the busiest season in November. The staff of state-owned commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions must change this wrong approach and quickly reverse the phenomenon of industrial goods being out of stock in the rural market.

    关键在于了解农村市场的需要
    孔桑
    进入旺季以来，各地许多农村市场普遍出现工业品脱销现象。现在，有些地区的党委和政府部门已开始重视这一问题，召开了紧急会议，组织国营商业和供销合作社的内部物资交流，组织基层供销社送货下乡，利用当地古会庙会组织物资交流，采用了这些措施，使部分地区的农村供应工作有了一些转变。
    许多地区，当工业品摆出来和农民见面的时候，就发现农民对工业品的需要十分迫切。往年少买的今年要多买，往年晚买的今年要早买，甚至连已经有些过季的商品，农民也需要。如山东禹城县三区有一个供销合作社的门市部，十月二十五日一天内就卖了九领凉席、长期积压的蚊帐布也都卖光。平原五区腰站的供销合作社门市部，有一个农民花三十多元买了一床毛毯。棉产区内飞鸽牌自行车很好销，进口自行车也有人买。这说明今年农村的购买力是很高的。
    在这种新情况下，部分供销合作社的工作人员就产生了一种新的想法：原来今年农村市场上是什么货都畅销，农民购买力高了，有什么就能销什么，而对农民究竟需要些什么却心中无数。他们没有想到“有钱不买半年闲”这句老话，农民在冬季买夏季用品，这说明供销社的供应工作做得不好。因为农民迫切需要的厚绒衣、好白布、花布头、学生蓝布以及铁锅、蒸笼、小缸等，供销社都脱销，就只好购买些一时不需用的过季商品或高贵商品。按理说，在这种情况下，供销合作社的工作人员，应该赶快研究农民为什么要购买这些商品，他们到底需要些什么，并根据具体需要立即进货供应。可是他们却不这样做，其中大部分供销合作社就大量推销库存商品，对进货仍然采取保守的方针，认为目前正是推销积压商品的好机会；也有个别地区的供销合作社，看见高贵商品也好销，就开始盲目地购进大中华香烟和大批皮袄统子等高级商品。
    商业工作人员这种不了解和不分析研究市场需要而盲目经营的做法，正是不能满足农村供应的主要原因。他们没有认识到社会主义商业工作者的主要任务是保证供应人民日益增长的生产和生活的需要，要做到这一点，就必须深入了解农民购买力增长的情况、农村合作化后、丰收后农民需要的新变化，再根据农民的具体需要，迅速积极购进适销的商品。商业工作人员不仅要深入了解农民的需要，更主要的还要指导消费。特别是现在广大农民的生活水平还相当低，有的甚至连日用必需品和零星小百货都很缺乏，需要增添各种各样的生活资料和生产资料，因此，只有及时向农民介绍商品，指导他们消费，并积极组织适销商品来供应，才能保证供应、加速资金周转。任何不研究客观需要，企图用单纯压缩库存推销过季货，或者用盲目购进高贵商品来加速资金周转的做法，不仅不能减少积压、消除脱销现象，同时对满足农民需要和完成供销社销售计划都很不利。
    十一月份农村市场将进入最旺的季节，各地国营商业部门和供销合作社的工作人员，必须改变这种错误的做法，迅速转变农村市场上工业品脱销的现象。
