    Chinese Character Reform and Telegraph Services
    Zhu Xuefan, Minister of Posts and Telecommunications of the People's Republic of China
    I fully agree with the policy and steps for simplifying Chinese characters adopted by the National Conference on Language Reform. That is, to select character forms based on the principle of "conventional usage," and to appropriately adopt radical analogy, while implementing simplification in stages and batches according to the principle of "steady progress." Regarding the unification of Chinese pronunciation, I agree to vigorously promote Mandarin Chinese—the common national language with Beijing pronunciation as its standard—to prepare for the fundamental reform of Chinese characters.
    Below, I would like to briefly discuss some issues related to language reform and telegraph services.
    Our hope is completely consistent with the needs of the broad masses, which is to first simplify Chinese characters and then gradually realize phonetic writing, in order to fundamentally solve the long-standing difficulties in telegraph services.
    There are many difficulties in using Chinese characters for telegraphing. Here, I will only discuss a few main aspects: (1) Because Chinese characters are square, individual characters and there are a large number of them, unlike phonetic writing which only has dozens of letters, this creates a great waste of manpower in telegraph transmission. Phonetic letters can be transmitted as they are written, and the recipient can understand them immediately, but Chinese characters are difficult. For machine transmission, Chinese characters must first be translated into a code form, that is, a group of four numbers constitutes a code representing one Chinese character. Currently, using thousands of different Chinese characters requires thousands of different code groups; after receiving these codes, the recipient must translate them back into the original characters to understand the meaning of the telegram. Of course, it is not easy for a decoder to memorize thousands of codes. According to the current level of proficiency of general decoders, copying and translating ten characters of text per minute, if each telegram averages thirty characters, then in a city post and telecommunications bureau that sends ten thousand telegrams a day, in terms of decoding, these ten thousand telegrams would consume thirty thousand minutes (equivalent to five hundred hours); calculating eight hours per working day, more than sixty people would be solely engaged in the work of translating telegrams. At the same time, the same amount of labor must be expended on the receiving end. This troublesome decoding work is even more prominent for international telegraph transmission. When our delegations attend meetings or visit abroad, and send a telegram to the country, or when Xinhua News Agency reporters report news to the country, foreign telegraph bureaus do not have such decoders, so we have to translate it ourselves. If we want to report a foreign language news item to the country, we must first translate the foreign language into Chinese, and then translate from Chinese into code before it can be transmitted. Due to the tedious decoding work, a telegram is often delayed by half a day or even a whole day. (2) As everyone knows, the most important thing in postal and telecommunications work is quality, and no errors are allowed in the transmission of telegrams. However, because our telegraph characters are composed of four numbers, it is relatively easy to make mistakes in quality. The consequences of some errors are very serious. Often, if one number is wrong in a group of four numbers, the meaning is completely different, or even completely opposite. For example, if a factory telegram needs ten tons of copper wire, the character for "copper" is "6894". If it is mistaken for "6884", ten tons of copper wire becomes ten tons of lead wire, because "6884" is the character for "lead". Another example is that "0823" is the character for "joy", and "0828" is the character for "mourning". With a difference of one digit, a joyous event becomes a mourning event. If phonetic writing is used to send telegrams, such errors will never occur because the meaning of the whole text can be directly understood from the characters. (3) In terms of transmission timeliness, if phonetic writing is used, efficiency will be greatly improved, and the manpower and time saved is simply incalculable. As mentioned earlier, repeated decoding takes five hundred hours of decoding time for ten thousand telegrams, which means that ten thousand telegrams are delayed by five hundred hours. Adding the sending and receiving parties, it is one thousand hours, which greatly affects the timeliness of telegrams. (4) Because Chinese characters cannot be directly transmitted on telegraph machines, there are also many problems within the telegraph service. For example, the machine language used for handling telegrams still uses foreign languages. This phenomenon is very abnormal. (5) The mechanization of telegraph transmission is greatly hindered.
    Of course, Chinese characters moving towards phoneticization is our greatest hope. However, this is a very arduous task, and it will take a considerable period of time to realize. Implementing Chinese character simplification first is absolutely necessary. In the stage of Chinese character simplification, there are also great benefits for telegraph services. First of all, the reduction of strokes in Chinese characters can save a lot of labor and time in copying and translating telegrams. With a unified plan for legally simplified characters, and all parties following this plan in using characters, the current inconsistent use of characters can be clarified, greatly facilitating telegraph processing and reducing many unnecessary errors and accidents. Secondly, with the large-scale reduction of variant characters, decoders no longer have to memorize the codes of many variant characters. In particular, the currently used code books will be greatly improved through the simplification of Chinese characters. The current code books are still based on the Kangxi Dictionary, and a large part of the single characters in it are no longer frequently used, and some characters are not used at all. Due to the rapid development of national construction and the continuous improvement of people's cultural life, there are many commonly used characters that are not included in the current code book, so it is sometimes necessary to create characters when transmitting telegrams. Obviously, the existing code book can no longer meet the current needs and must be revised. The implementation of the Chinese character simplification plan provides an excellent basis for revising the telegraph character code. Of course, because Chinese character simplification is being promoted in batches, there may still be some difficult problems in the technical aspects of revising the code book, but we can find ways to overcome these difficulties. Currently, in order to facilitate telegraph users to translate telegrams, we are preparing to print a "Simplified Character Code Lookup Table" first.
    The Chinese teleprinter designed by our country has been initially tested successfully, and simplified Chinese characters can be used to configure the type disk, so that the type disk can be reduced accordingly, reducing the complexity of the current design.
    Writing is a tool for recording language, and the telegraph is a tool for transmitting writing. The telegraph serves in coordination with writing. What kind of writing, produces what kind of telegraph. In the process of language reform, the telegraph profession has all the conditions to cooperate with this work. The major measure of language reform is beneficial to the country's construction and the improvement of people's cultural life, and it is also of great benefit to the postal and telecommunications cause. Therefore, all our postal and telecommunications workers warmly support language reform. We especially hope that phonetic writing can be realized as soon as possible. All our postal and telecommunications workers are willing to make the greatest efforts to promote the complete realization of language reform.

    汉字改革和电报业务
    中华人民共和国邮电部长　朱学范
    我完全同意全国文字改革会议通过的汉字简化的方针和步骤，即在选定字形上根据“约定俗成”的原则，并适当采用偏旁类推，而在推行步骤上根据“稳步前进”的原则，采取分次分批简化的办法。对于统一汉语的语音，我同意大力推行以北京语音为标准音的普通话——民族共同语，为汉字的根本改革作准备。
    下面我想简单谈一下文字改革同电报业务有关的若干问题。
    我们的希望同广大群众的需要，是完全一致的，也就是先简化汉字，逐步实现拼音文字，以便从根本上解决电报业务中长期存在的困难问题。
    用汉字打电报的困难是很多的。这里我仅就几个主要方面谈一下：（一）由于汉字是方块个体字，字数很多，不像拼音文字只有几十个字母，因此在电报传递上造成人力的很大浪费。拼音字母是怎样写出来就能怎样传递过去，对方一看就懂，而汉字就困难了，它在机器上传递首先要把汉字译成电码的形式，也就是要由四个数目字构成一组电码、代表一个汉字。现在使用几千个不同的汉字，就要有几千个不同的电码组；对方收到这些电码之后，还要把它译回原来的文字，才能看出这份电报的意思。一个译电人员要记住几千个电码当然不是一件容易的事。按照现在一般译电人员翻译电报的熟练程度来说，每分钟抄译电文十个字，如果每份电报平均三十个字，那末在一个每天发一万份电报的城市邮电局，在译电方面，这一万份电报，就得消耗三万分钟（折合五百小时）；以八小时一个工作日计算，就要有六十多人单纯地做翻译电报的工作。同时在收报方面也要同样付出这样多的劳动力。这种译电的麻烦工作，对于国际之间的电报传递更显得突出。我们在国外开会或者访问的代表团向国内发一个电报，新华社的记者向国内报道一篇新闻，外国电报局没有这种译电人员，我们只好自己译。如果要报道一份外国文字的新闻到国内来，首先把外文翻成中文，再从中文翻成电码才能传递过来。由于烦琐的译电工作，往往一份电报要推迟半天或者长至一天。（二）大家知道，邮电工作最重要的是质量问题，在电报的传递中，是不容许出差错的。但是由于我们的电报文字是由四个数目字所组成的，在质量方面就比较容易出差错。有些差错所造成的后果，是很严重的，往往一组四个数目字的电码，其中错了一个数目字，意思就完全不同，甚至完全相反。比如一个工厂打电报需要十吨铜丝，“铜”字是“六八九四”，如果错成了“六八八四”，十吨铜丝就变成十吨铅丝了，因为“六八八四”是一个“铅”字。又如“○八二三”是“喜”字，“○八二八”是“丧”字，一字之差，一件喜事变成了一件丧事。假如使用拼音文字拍发电报，因为从文字上可以直接看懂全文的意思，就决不会发生这种差错。（三）在传递的时效方面，如果使用拼音文字，效率将大大地提高，节省的人力和时间简直没法计算。如前面所说的，由于反复译电，一万份电报要费去五百小时的译电时间，也就是说，一万份电报要耽误五百小时，收发双方加起来，就是一千小时，大大影响着电报的时效。（四）由于汉字不能在电报机上直接传递，因此在电报业务内部也有许多问题。例如处理报务的机上用语等等，目前还一直沿用着外国语。这种现象是很不正常的。（五）电报传递的机械化受到很大阻碍。
    当然，汉字走向拼音化是我们最大的希望。但是这是一项很艰巨的工作，还需要一个相当时期才能实现，目前先实行汉字简化，完全是必要的。而在汉字简化阶段，对于电报业务也是有很大好处的。首先是汉字笔画的减少，在抄译电报上，可以节省许多劳力和时间。由于有了法定的简化字的统一方案，各方面都遵循这一方案使用文字，可以廓清目前一部分使用文字不一致的现象，使电报处理上获得很大便利，并将减少许多不必要的差错事故。其次是随着大量削减异体字，译电人员可以不必再去记忆许多异体字的电码了。特别是目前使用的电码本子，通过汉字的简化，将获得很大的改进。现在所用的电码本子，还是根据康熙字典编排的，它有很大一部分单字，已经不是经常使用的了，有些字甚至根本没有用。由于国家建设事业的迅速发展，人民文化生活的不断提高，有许多现行的常用字，电码本里却没有包括进去，因此在传递电报中有时不得不造字。很显然，现有的电码本子，已经不能满足目前的需要，必须重行修订。汉字简化方案的实行，使修订电报字码有了极好的根据。当然，由于汉字简化是分批推行的，在修订电码本的技术方面，可能还有些困难问题，但是这些困难我们是可以设法克服的，目前准备为了便利发报用户翻译电报，先印行一种“简化字的电码检字表”。
    我国自己设计的中文电传打字机已经初步试验成功，将可以采用简化汉字来配制字盘，使字盘相应地缩小，减轻目前设计上的复杂性。
    文字是记录语言的工具，电报是传递文字的工具，电报是配合文字来服务的。什么样的文字，就产生什么样的电报。在文字改革的过程中，电报专业具有一切条件来配合这一工作。文字改革这一重大措施有利于国家的建设事业以及人民的文化生活的提高，对邮电事业也有莫大的好处，因此我们全国邮电职工，对于文字改革是热烈拥护的。我们尤其希望拼音文字能够早日实现。我们全体邮电职工，都愿意尽最大的努力，促使文字改革彻底实现。
