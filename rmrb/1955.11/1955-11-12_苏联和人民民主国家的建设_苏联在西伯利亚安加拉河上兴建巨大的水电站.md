    The Construction of the Soviet Union and People's Democratic Countries
    The Soviet Union is Building a Huge Hydropower Station on the Angara River in Siberia

　　Just as the world's largest Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station is about to begin generating electricity, the Soviet Union has decided to build an even larger Bratsk Hydroelectric Station. The first part of this hydroelectric station is scheduled to be put into production during the Sixth Five-Year Plan (1956-1960).
　　This immense hydroelectric station is the second hydroelectric station built by the Soviet Union on the Angara River in Siberia. It is located near Bratsk, an ancient village about 600 kilometers from the Irkutsk Hydroelectric Station, which is under construction. The reservoir of the new hydroelectric station will reach 133,000 hectares. Preparations for construction have already begun on the site since May 1955. A railway branch line has begun to be built on the right bank of the Angara River. A 40-kilometer section of highway has been completed. Some auxiliary enterprises are currently under construction on the site.
    The Angara River originates from Lake Baikal, the deepest lake in the world. It flows north and joins the Yenisei River before flowing into the Arctic Ocean. It possesses more hydropower resources than any river in the European part of the Soviet Union. The electricity it can generate is greater than the total electricity of all power stations in France, Italy, Sweden, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, and Denmark combined.
    In addition, the Angara River has a constant flow throughout the year, which can be used to produce cheap electricity. Moreover, the earthwork and concrete work required to build a hydropower station are much less than those required to build a hydropower station with the same power generation capacity elsewhere.

    苏联和人民民主国家的建设
    苏联在西伯利亚安加拉河上兴建巨大的水电站
　　当世界上最大的古比雪夫水电站即将开始发电的时候，苏联又决定建设一个比它更大的布拉次克水电站了。预定这个水电站第一部分将在第六个五年计划（一九五六——一九六○年）期间投入生产。
　　这个巨大无比的水电站是苏联在西伯利亚的安加拉河上兴建的第二个水电站，座落在距离正在兴建的伊尔库次克水电站约六百公里的一个古老的村庄布拉次克附近。新水电站的水库将达十三万三千公顷。从一九五五年五月起，建设的准备工作已经在工地上开始了。在安加拉河的右岸已经开始兴建一条铁路支线。四十公里长的一段公路已经修建完成。目前工地上正在兴建一些辅助企业。
    安加拉河发源于世界上最深的贝加尔湖，向北与叶尼塞河汇合，流入北冰洋。它拥有的水力资源超过苏联欧洲部分任何一条河流，它所能发出的电力，比现在法国、意大利、瑞典、比利时、荷兰、西班牙和丹麦各国所有发电站的电力总和还要大。
    此外，安加拉河流量常年不变，利用它可以生产出廉价的电力。而且在建造水电站所需要的土方工程和混凝土工程，要比在其他地方建造同样发电能力的水电站所需要的少得多。
