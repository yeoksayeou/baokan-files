Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 7th -- The Tokyo Overseas Chinese Association lodged a strong protest with the Japanese government on the 4th, protesting the Japanese government's reaching an "agreement" with the Chiang Kai-shek clique to forcibly send over one hundred Chinese nationals detained at the Hamamatsu "Reception Center" in Shizuoka Prefecture to Taiwan. The protest stated: According to recent reports from various authoritative Japanese news organizations, the Japanese government, in accordance with a certain "agreement" reached with the Chiang Kai-shek clique's organization in Japan, has decided to forcibly send more than one hundred Chinese currently detained at the Hamamatsu "Immigration Reception Center" from Japan to Taiwan. The Tokyo Overseas Chinese Association believes that this decision by the Japanese government is a very unfriendly measure towards the Chinese government and the entire Chinese people, and therefore lodges a strong protest.

The protest further stated: The Tokyo Overseas Chinese Association has long been concerned about the fact that many Chinese are being detained at the Omura "Immigration Reception Center," and in view of the fact that justly and properly resolving the issue of these detainees would help improve Sino-Japanese relations, it has, as an overseas Chinese organization, made its best efforts to resolve this issue. In February and March of 1955, more than one hundred people were released, and then more than fifty of them returned to China together with other旅日 (literally "traveling in Japan" but here meaning residing) Overseas Chinese who volunteered to return to their country. This is a very clear proof. At that time, the person in charge of the Tokyo Overseas Chinese Association repeatedly pointed out to the person in charge of the Immigration Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Justice that this issue essentially belongs to consular affairs, and to fully resolve this issue, the two governments must directly negotiate. Nevertheless, the Japanese government has not taken any proper measures to this day. This fact should be recorded.

The protest pointed out: As is well known, the Government of the People's Republic of China, in a statement by its Foreign Ministry spokesperson on August 16, 1955, expressed its willingness to negotiate with the Japanese government on the issue of Overseas Chinese and various other issues related to the interests of the peoples of both countries.

The protest stated: Despite this, the Japanese government has reached a certain "agreement" with the Chiang Kai-shek clique, deciding to forcibly send the Chinese detained at the Hamamatsu "Immigration Reception Center" to Taiwan. This is not only unfriendly to the Chinese government and the entire Chinese people, but is also clearly contradictory in light of the fact that the Japanese government had its Consul-General contact the Consul-General of the People's Republic of China in Geneva. More importantly, it fundamentally violates the Japanese government's repeated promises to "work to improve Sino-Japanese relations."

The protest concluded: If the Japanese government can be true to its promises, it should immediately revoke its previous decision and change its erroneous attitude on the issue of Overseas Chinese, and begin direct negotiations between the two governments.

### 就日本政府把一百多个华侨强制送往台湾  东京华侨总会向日本政府提出严重抗议

    就日本政府把一百多个华侨强制送往台湾
    东京华侨总会向日本政府提出严重抗议
    新华社七日讯　东京消息：东京华侨总会在四日向日本政府提出严重抗议，抗议日本政府同蒋介石集团达成“协议”，把拘留在静冈县滨松“收容所”的一百多个中国侨民强制送往台湾。抗议书说：根据日本有权威的各种报道机关最近的报道，日本政府按照它同蒋介石集团驻日本机关间所达成的某种“协议”，决定把目前拘留在滨松“入国者收容所”的一百多个中国人用强制的手段由日本送往台湾。东京华侨总会认为日本政府的这个决定对于中国政府和全中国人民是非常不友好的措施，因此提出严重的抗议。
    抗议书又说：东京华侨总会早就重视许多中国人被拘留在大村“入国者收容所”的事实，并且鉴于公正地和妥善地解决这些被拘留者的问题有助于改善中日两国关系，作为一个侨民团体，曾经尽了最大可能的努力以解决这个问题。一九五五年二、三月间有一百多个人被释放出来，然后其中有五十多个人同其他志愿返国的旅日华侨一起返国了，这就是一个很明显的证明。那时候，东京华侨总会的负责人曾经屡次向日本法务省入国管理局的负责人指出：这个问题实质上是属于领事事务，要全面地解决这个问题，必须由两国政府直接进行协商。尽管如此，日本政府直到现在还没有采取任何妥善的措施。这个事实应该把它记录起来。
    抗议书指出：如所周知，中华人民共和国政府曾于一九五五年八月十六日在外交部发言人的声明中表示愿意同日本政府就侨民问题和其他有关两国人民利益的各种问题进行协商。
    抗议书说：尽管如此，日本政府却同蒋介石集团达成了某种“协议”，决定把拘留在滨松“入国者收容所”的中国人强制送往台湾。这不仅对于中国政府和全中国人民是不友好的，而且就日本政府使日本总领事在日内瓦和中华人民共和国总领事接触的事实看来显然是自相矛盾的。更重要的是根本违反了日本政府屡次所许下的“为改善中日关系而努力”的诺言。
    抗议书最后说：如果日本政府能忠实于它的诺言，就应该立即撤销以前的决定，并且改变它在侨民问题上的错误态度，而开始两国政府间直接的协商。
