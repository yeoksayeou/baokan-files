Dunhuang is the westernmost county in the Hexi Corridor of Gansu. Its south is bounded by the continuous Qilian Mountains, while the other three sides are surrounded by the vast Gobi Desert, forming a fertile basin in the middle. This year, Dunhuang County has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest of cotton. According to current information, the average yield of seed cotton per mu is 280 jin, an increase of 34 jin per mu compared to last year's average yield.

This spring, Dunhuang County formulated a plan to expand cotton fields by 50,000 mu. The Dunhuang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party fully recognized that this was an arduous task. This was not only because the area of cotton fields suddenly increased more than twofold compared to 1954, and planting technology was far behind the needs of production development; more importantly, many farmers were worried about expanding cotton fields. Many farmers were afraid that if they planted too much cotton, they would not have enough grain to eat and enough fodder to feed livestock; they were afraid that planting cotton would be labor-intensive, and that labor and animal power would not be enough, and that even with a bumper harvest of cotton, they would not be able to bring it home. Therefore, the County Committee carried out extensive and in-depth propaganda and education among the farmers, so that the farmers realized that planting cotton would both support industrial production and increase their own income. Some districts and townships used detailed accounting methods to show that the county had enough grain to eat and use. Some places organized the masses to cut grass in Beihu (more than 5 million jin throughout the year) to solve the problem of livestock shortage of grass; mobilized women to take on the task of picking cotton to overcome the difficulty of labor shortage. In order to do a good job in planting technology, the County People's Committee transferred more than 500 people, including directors and members of agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid team leaders, and production experts from various townships, to conduct short-term training in planting technology, and through them, they taught planting technology to hundreds of farmers.

The selection and promotion of improved varieties played a decisive role in the high cotton yield in Dunhuang County. In the past, Dunhuang planted black-seed cotton. This kind of cotton matured late, had long fruit branches, and produced few cotton bolls, with an average yield of only 30 to 40 jin of ginned cotton per mu. In 1952, the excellent cotton variety "S3173" was introduced from the Soviet Union. In the same year, the 191 mu of trial planting produced 82 jin of ginned cotton per mu, more than double the yield of local black-seed cotton. In 1954, Soviet cotton seeds were sown on two-thirds of the cotton field area in the county. This year, all cotton fields were sown with this cotton seed. Before sowing, many areas of the county carried out meticulous manual seed selection of cotton seeds, and more than 80% of farmers carried out seed drying. Various places also adopted Ceresan seed dressing, dry dressing and covering, and warm water soaking, which effectively reduced the harm of bacteria to cotton. The county also promoted the advanced experience of Li Wenfu, a county labor model, in "wide row spacing, reasonable close planting," which greatly promoted the development and growth of cotton seedlings.

In the past, Dunhuang County did not pay attention to the management of cotton fields in its cotton planting work. After planting cotton, farmers only hoed the fields twice, topped the cotton once, and did no other field management work. This year, the Dunhuang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the County People's Committee paid attention to leading the masses to do a good job in cotton field management. When the cotton seedlings emerged, they organized the masses to carry out thinning and setting seedlings. Dunhuang has a farming saying: "Hoe cotton eight times, the boll becomes like an egg." This year, many areas of the county have achieved: hoeing as soon as the seedlings emerge, hoeing when it is dry, and hoeing after watering, and adopting the method of hoeing shallow first, then deep, and then shallow again to avoid damaging the roots. Each piece of land was generally hoeed three or four times, and some were hoeed five times, thereby clearing weeds from the fields, loosening the soil, reducing water evaporation, and promoting the development and growth of cotton seedlings. This year, 30,000 mu of cotton fields in the county were trimmed, and more than 90% of the cotton fields were topped. In addition, the county also promoted more than 110,000 jin of chemical fertilizers and applied topdressing in a timely manner.

Dunhuang has sparse rainfall, with an average annual rainfall of only 49.8 mm; all cotton fields in the county rely on Qilian Mountain snow water and spring water for irrigation. In order to irrigate in a planned way, under the unified organization and leadership of the County People's Committee, the townships arranged the order of watering according to the area of cotton fields sown, and rotated watering to avoid the phenomenon of being relaxed at the beginning and tight at the end, irrigation congestion, and delaying the farming season. On average, each piece of land was watered three times, and some were watered four times. In order to save water and expand the irrigation area, cotton ditch irrigation was also promoted as a key measure. The result of ditch irrigation implemented by the Dujiadun Agricultural Production Cooperative proved that: ditch irrigation not only increased the average yield of cotton by more than 40 jin per mu compared to flood irrigation (i.e., flooding the land with water), but also saved more than 50% of the water volume.

This year, Dunhuang has had a bumper harvest of cotton, but the potential for cotton yield increase has not been fully realized. From the perspective of cotton planting technology, this year, just because the land preparation and moisture conservation work before sowing were not done well, the lack of seedlings in the county's cotton fields reached about 20%. Other work such as pruning, topping, intertillage and weeding, and fertilization were not completely done well. In 1956, the county will establish 101 agricultural production cooperatives, which will basically achieve collectivization (the number of farmers joining the cooperatives will reach about 76%). In this way, increased cotton production will be even more guaranteed. Take the 26 newly built agricultural production cooperatives this year as an example, all of them have increased production to varying degrees, some by more than double compared to last year, and the lowest is also an increase of 15%.

In order to promote the cotton planting experience of Dunhuang County to all counties in the entire Hexi Corridor, in August this year, the former Jiuquan Prefecture organized 22 farmer representatives from the main cotton-producing areas of Linze, Gaotai, Jinta, Dingxin, Yumen, and Anxi counties to visit Dunhuang. Zhangye Prefecture (merged from the original Jiuquan and Wuwei Prefectures) plans to expand the area of cotton fields in the main agricultural counties of the Hexi Corridor by 170,000 mu (existing 55,000 mu) next year. In the next few years, with the reclamation of a large amount of wasteland and the planned utilization of Qilian Mountain snow water, the Hexi Corridor will not only become a rich granary in northwestern China, but also become one of China's new cotton producing areas.

　　敦煌县的棉花丰收
　　本报记者　康伟中
    敦煌，是甘肃河西走廊最西的一个县。它的南面横亘着连绵不断的祁连山，其他三面被辽阔的戈壁滩和大沙漠所包围，中间形成一块富饶的盆地。今年敦煌县棉花获得了前所未有的大丰收，据现在了解，平均每亩产籽棉二百八十斤，较去年每亩平均产量增加三十四斤。
    今年春天，敦煌县制定了扩大棉田五万亩的计划，中共敦煌县委会充分估计到这是一项艰巨的任务。这不仅因为棉田面积突然较一九五四年增加了二倍多，在植棉技术上远远赶不上生产发展的需要；而更重要的，还由于许多农民对扩大棉田抱有顾虑。许多农民怕棉花种多了，粮食不够吃，饲料不够喂；怕种棉花费工，劳畜力来不及，棉花丰收了拾不到家里来等等。因此，县委向农民进行了广泛深入的宣传教育，使农民认识到种棉花既支援了工业生产，也使自己增加了收入。有的区乡采用算细账的方法，说明全县粮食够吃够用。有的地方组织群众到北湖打草（全年打五百多万斤），解决牲畜缺草问题；动员妇女担任拣棉花的任务，克服劳力不足的困难。为作好植棉技术工作，县人民委员会抽调各乡农业生产合作社主任、委员和互助组长、生产能手等五百多人，进行了植棉技术的短期训练，通过他们，又向数百个农民传授了植棉技术。
    选种和推广良种在敦煌县棉花丰产上起了决定性的作用。过去，敦煌种植的棉花都是黑籽棉。这种棉花成熟晚，果枝长，结棉铃少，每亩平均产量只有皮棉三、四十斤。一九五二年由苏联引进了“斯三一七三”号优良棉种。当年试种的一百九十一亩，每亩产皮棉八十二斤，超过当地黑籽棉产量一倍多。一九五四年，苏联棉种在全县三分之二的棉田面积上播种。今年全部棉田播种了这种棉籽。播种前，全县许多地区都进行了比较细致的棉种人工粒选，并且有百分之八十以上的农户进行了晒种工作。各地还采用了赛力散拌种、干拌闷种和温汤浸种，这就有力地减轻了病菌对棉花的为害。全县还推广了县劳动模范李文福的“宽耧合理密植”的先进经验，大大促进了棉苗的发育和成长。
    过去，敦煌县在植棉工作中是不重视棉田的管理的。农民种上棉花后，只在田间锄两遍，打一次棉花顶，就不再作其他田间管理工作了。今年，中共敦煌县委会和县人民委员会注意领导群众做好棉田管理工作。当棉苗出土的时候，就组织群众进行了间苗和定苗工作。敦煌有句农谚：“棉花锄八遍，疙瘩成鸡蛋。”今年，全县许多地区都作到：苗出来就锄，亢旱了要锄，浇水后也锄，并且采用先浅后深再浅锄的方法，避免伤根，每块地一般都锄了三、四遍，有的锄了五遍，从而清除了田间杂草，疏松了土壤，减少了水分蒸发，促进了棉苗的发育和成长。今年全县有三万亩棉田进行了整株，百分之九十以上棉田都打了顶。此外，全县还推广了化学肥料十一万多斤，适时地施了追肥。
    敦煌雨量稀少，平均年雨量仅有四十九点八公厘；全县棉田都依靠祁连山雪水和泉水灌溉。为了有计划地浇水，在县人民委员会的统一组织和领导下，各乡根据棉田播种面积，排列先后次序，轮流浇水，避免了前松后紧、灌溉拥挤、贻误农时的现象，平均每块地都浇了三次水，有的浇了四次。为了节约用水，扩大灌溉面积，还重点地推行了棉花沟灌。杜家墩农业生产合作社实行沟灌的结果证明：沟灌比漫灌（即漫地浇水）不仅每亩地平均增产棉花四十多斤，而且节约了百分之五十以上的水量。
    今年敦煌棉花丰收了，但是棉花增产的潜力还没有充分发挥。从植棉技术上看，今年仅仅由于播种前的整地、保墒工作没有做好，全县棉田缺苗的就达到百分之二十左右。其他如整枝、打顶、中耕锄草、施肥等工作也没有完全做好。一九五六年全县要建立农业生产合作社一百零一个，将基本上达到合作化（入社农户将达到百分之七十六左右）。这样，棉花增产就更有保证了。就拿今年新建的二十六个农业生产合作社来说，都程度不同地增了产，有的比去年增产一倍多，最低也增产了百分之十五。
    为了把敦煌县的植棉经验推广到整个河西走廊各县，今年八月间，前酒泉专署组织了临泽、高台、金塔、鼎新、玉门、安西等县主要产棉区农民代表二十二人，来敦煌参观。张掖专署（由原酒泉、武威两专署合并）计划明年在河西走廊主要农业县扩大棉田面积十七万亩（原有五万五千亩）。在今后几年内，随着大量荒地的开垦，和祁连山雪水的有计划的利用，河西走廊将不仅成为我国西北丰富的粮仓，而且也将成为我国新的棉产区之一。
