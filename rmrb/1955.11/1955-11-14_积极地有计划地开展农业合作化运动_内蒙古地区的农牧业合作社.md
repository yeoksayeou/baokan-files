Actively and systematically carry out the agricultural cooperation movement

　　Agricultural and pastoral cooperatives in Inner Mongolia

　　By our reporter Lin Mo
    In recent years, more than one hundred semi-socialist agricultural and pastoral production cooperatives have emerged in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Most of these cooperatives are jointly formed by Mongolian and Han farmers and herdsmen. They work together, learn production techniques from each other, and strengthen political unity through economic mutual assistance. With the help of Han members, Mongolian members of the Xianfeng Agricultural and Pastoral Cooperative in Junwang Banner have learned rice cultivation techniques. This year, the cooperative has trial-planted 180 mu of rice, with an expected yield of 300 jin per mu. Han members have also learned livestock breeding experience from Mongolian members, raising the cooperative's livestock to be fat and strong. The Red Agricultural and Pastoral Cooperative in Junwang Banner, due to sufficient animal power and manure, coupled with better natural conditions, has increased agricultural production by more than double this year compared to last year; the cooperative planted 120 mu of pasture, harvesting over 90,000 jin, ensuring that the cooperative's more than 800 livestock can safely survive the winter. Agricultural and pastoral cooperatives that are better run throughout the region have demonstrated their superiority in promoting ethnic unity, mutual support between agriculture and animal husbandry, and increased production.

    This type of agricultural and pastoral cooperative is of particular importance for further developing agricultural and pastoral production and strengthening ethnic unity in Inner Mongolia.

    In the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, animal husbandry accounts for a large proportion of production, with over 20 million livestock in the region. However, only a little over half of these livestock are in pure grassland pastoral areas, with another ten million or so in semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas and agricultural areas.

    Inner Mongolia has 72 banners and counties, of which more than 20 are roughly of a semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral nature. In these areas, farmland and pastures are intertwined, with Mongolians and Han Chinese living together; some families engage in both agriculture and animal husbandry, while some villages have both farmers and herdsmen. Before the collective operation of agriculture and animal husbandry by cooperatives, conflicts often arose between farming and grazing in many areas. After the establishment of cooperatives, unified management of agriculture and animal husbandry can, with the help of the government, carry out unified planning and rational adjustment of farmland and pastures, making them suitable for both agricultural production and grazing, thereby integrating agriculture and animal husbandry for common development. Agricultural production provides sufficient feed for livestock, while animal husbandry provides the necessary animal power and large amounts of manure for agriculture. According to a survey of four agricultural and pastoral cooperatives in Zhalute Banner, conflicts between agriculture and animal husbandry have been resolved due to the unified adjustment of farmland and pastures by the cooperatives. Due to the sufficient feed provided by agricultural production for livestock, the breeding and survival rates of livestock have generally increased. Agriculture has gradually increased its output by transitioning from no fertilization to fertilization.

    This combination of agriculture and animal husbandry, implemented on the basis of cooperation, has also created experience for the future transformation of pastoral production in the vast grassland pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia.

    The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region covers an area of more than 1.1 million square kilometers, more than half of which is pure grassland pastoral area. Here, herdsmen basically live a nomadic life, relying on natural grasslands to graze livestock. When there is insufficient water and grass or wind and snow disasters (which occur frequently), livestock die in large numbers. Therefore, this kind of animal husbandry production is highly vulnerable. To change this situation, it is necessary, under the leadership of state-owned ranches and state-owned farms, and on the basis of mutual aid and cooperation organizations in animal husbandry, to help and guide herdsmen in a planned and gradual manner to plant pasture and feed, and establish artificial feed bases; at the same time, promote the gradual settlement of herdsmen. In the future, the development of animal husbandry will gradually combine with agriculture according to the needs of herdsmen. Because at that time, agriculture will not only not conflict with animal husbandry, but also, with the support of agriculture, enable animal husbandry production to obtain a solid foundation and rapid development, greatly increase the income of herdsmen, and improve their material and cultural lives.

    Agricultural and pastoral cooperatives also play a major role in the agricultural areas of Inner Mongolia. Agricultural areas have wide land, with an average of one hectare (15 mu) of cultivated land per agricultural population, and there are also wastelands and grasslands everywhere, almost "every village has grasslands, and every household raises livestock"; "large livestock plow the land, and small livestock generate profit." That is to say, there are certain conditions for developing animal husbandry here. At present, the existing number of livestock in agricultural areas, calculated on the average population of this region, is about two per person. However, among the staff in the agricultural areas of Inner Mongolia, there is currently a fairly common erroneous idea of valuing agriculture while neglecting animal husbandry. Some banner and county agricultural and pastoral work departments only lead agricultural production and not animal husbandry. Many production cooperatives established in agricultural areas, although they have the natural conditions to develop animal husbandry, and many members also raise livestock, the cooperatives only manage agriculture and do not manage and develop animal husbandry. Members also cannot raise livestock well because they concentrate their efforts on agricultural production. The livestock of mutual aid group members and general individual farmers mostly grow and develop naturally, resulting in rapid reproduction but also high mortality rates. This situation is extremely detrimental to the country and the people. To change this situation, it is necessary to vigorously promote and popularize the method of combining agriculture and animal husbandry in production cooperatives and mutual aid groups in agricultural areas, according to possibility and need.

    Agricultural and pastoral conflicts in Inner Mongolia have a long history. In the past, the Manchu Qing feudal rulers and later warlords colluded with the ruling class of Inner Mongolia to force people to "reclaim" grasslands and plunder wealth. The Mongolian people waged many heroic struggles to protect pastures and oppose reclamation. After liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the People's Government, the ethnic disputes created by the reactionary ruling class no longer exist. However, the influence it left among the Mongolian and Han people, as well as the unreasonable phenomenon of intertwined farmland and pastures caused by blind reclamation, cannot be completely eliminated in a short period of time. In order to further solve these problems, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Party Committee and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government have implemented the policy of "prohibiting wasteland reclamation, protecting pastures, prioritizing animal husbandry, and taking care of agriculture" in semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas; Party committees and governments at all levels have also assisted farmers and herdsmen in delineating farmland and pasture boundaries, with both parties signing agreements and not violating them. These measures have reduced disputes between agriculture and animal husbandry and between Mongolian and Han people, and strengthened ethnic unity. However, when agricultural and pastoral production is still based on a decentralized, individual economy, it is difficult to completely resolve the artificial contradictions between agricultural and pastoral production. Farmers often reclaim wasteland indiscriminately for their own farming convenience; herdsmen often destroy farmland for their own grazing convenience. In some places, herdsmen want to protect grasslands, while farmers dig up grass roots and cut down sand willows to solve the difficulty of burning firewood. Therefore, disputes often occur between farmers and herdsmen, between villages, districts, and banners and counties over these matters. The government constantly mediates and handles them, but problems continue to arise. Organizing agricultural and pastoral production cooperatives can solve these problems more thoroughly. Because cooperatives manage agriculture and animal husbandry in a collective manner, they can rationally divide and use farmland and pastures under the leadership of the local government. The contradictions between farmers and herdsmen caused by production disappear, and agriculture and animal husbandry are closely integrated and support each other. Mongolian herdsmen and Han farmers work together in cooperatives, learn production techniques from each other, and help each other. In this way, they establish an unbreakable ethnic friendship in the new production relations. Therefore, Mongolian and Han members praise their cooperatives, saying: "The crops are growing well, the livestock are fat, and both Mongolians and Han Chinese are happy."

　　内蒙古地区的农牧业合作社

    近几年来，在内蒙古自治区出现了一百多个农、牧业结合的半社会主义的生产合作社。这些合作社多半是由蒙、汉族的农、牧民共同组成的。他们在一起共同劳动，互相学习生产技术，通过经济上的互助，加强了政治上的团结。郡王旗先锋农牧业合作社的蒙族社员在汉族社员帮助下，学会了种水稻的技术。今年全社试种水稻一百八十亩，每亩可收三百斤。汉族社员也从蒙族社员学习了饲养牲畜的经验，把全社的牲畜养得膘满肉肥。郡王旗红色农牧业合作社，因为畜力、粪肥充足，再加自然条件较好，今年农业生产较去年增产一倍多；全社种植一百二十亩牧草，共收九万多斤，使全社八百多头牲畜安全过冬有了一定的保证。全区一些办得比较好的农牧业合作社，都显示了它们的促进民族团结，农、牧互相支援和增加生产的优越性。
    这种农、牧业结合的合作社，对于进一步发展内蒙古地区的农、牧业生产，加强民族团结，有特别重要的意义。
    在内蒙古自治区，畜牧业生产占很大的比重，全区现有二千多万头牲畜。但是这些牲畜在纯草原牧区的只有一半多一些，另有一千来万头是在半农半牧区和农业区。
    内蒙古共有七十二个旗、县，其中，大致属于半农半牧性质的就有二十多个。在这些半农半牧地区，多是农田和牧场插花交错，蒙族和汉族一地杂居；有的是一家之内农、牧业兼营；有的是一村之中农、牧民共处。在农、牧业由合作社集体经营以前，很多地区往往发生种地同放牧的矛盾。在建立了合作社以后，对农、牧业实行统一经营，就可以在政府帮助下，把农田和牧场进行统一的规划和合理的调整，使之既适合于农业生产，又便利于放牧，从而使农业和牧业很好地结合起来共同发展，农业生产供给牲畜充分的饲料，畜牧业则供给农业所需要的畜力和大量的粪肥。根据扎鲁特旗四个农牧业合作社的调查，由于合作社统一调整了农田、牧场，农、牧矛盾得以解决。由于农业生产供给牲畜充分的饲料，牲畜的繁殖率和成活率普遍提高。农业上由不施肥而开始施肥，产量逐步提高。
    这种在合作化的基础上所实行的农、牧结合的经营，也给内蒙古自治区广大草原牧区未来改造牧业生产创造了经验。
    内蒙古自治区的面积有一百一十多万平方公里，一半以上是纯草原牧区。在这里，牧民基本上过着游牧生活，依靠自然草原放牧牲畜，遇到水草不足的情况或风、雪灾害（这种灾害经常有），牲畜就要大批死亡。因此，这样的畜牧业生产就带有很大的脆弱性。要改变这种状况，必须在国营牧场、国营农场的带动下，在牧业互助合作组织的基础上，有计划地、逐步地帮助和领导牧民种植牧草、饲料，建立人工饲料基地；同时促使牧民也逐步定居下来。将来，牧业的发展将会根据牧民的需要逐渐同农业结合起来。因为到那时候农业不但同牧业没有矛盾，而且可以在农业的支援下使牧业生产获得稳固的基础和迅速的发展，大大增加牧民的收入，提高牧民的物质和文化生活。
    农、牧业结合的合作社对于内蒙古的农业区也有很大作用。农业区土地宽广，每个农业人口平均有一公顷（十五市亩）耕地，而且到处还有荒地、草场，差不多是“村村有草场，户户养牲畜”；“大畜耕地，小畜生利”。就是说，在这里，发展畜牧业，也是有一定条件的。目前，农业区的现有牲畜数字，按这个地区的人口平均，每人约有两头。但是在内蒙古农业区的工作人员中间，目前相当普遍地有重视农业而轻视牧业的错误思想。有些旗、县的农、牧工作部门，只领导农业生产而不领导牧业。在农业区建立的许多生产合作社，虽然有发展畜牧业的自然条件，许多社员也都养有牲畜，但是合作社只经营农业，而不经营和发展畜牧业。社员也因集中力量搞农业生产，不能很好地饲养牲畜。互助组组员和一般单干农民的牲畜，大多是任其自生自长，以致形成繁殖得快，死亡得多的情况。这种情况对国家和人民都是极为不利的。要改变这种状况，就要在农业区的生产合作社和互助组中根据可能和需要，大力提倡和推广农、牧结合的办法。
    农、牧矛盾在内蒙古地区有其长久的历史根源。过去，满清封建统治者和后来的军阀曾同内蒙古的统治阶级勾结起来，强迫人民“开垦”草原，掠夺财富。蒙族人民为保护牧场，反对垦荒，曾进行过多次英勇的斗争。解放后，在共产党、毛主席和人民政府的领导下，由反动统治阶级所制造的民族纠纷已经不存在了。但是，它在蒙、汉人民群众中所遗留的影响以及由于盲目开垦所造成的农田、牧场插花交错的不合理现象，并不是短时期可以彻底消除的。中共内蒙古自治区党委和内蒙古自治区人民政府为了进一步解决这些问题，在半农半牧地区执行了“禁止开荒，保护牧场，以牧为主，照顾农业”的政策；各级党委和政府也协助农、牧民划定农田、牧场界线，双方立约，互不违犯。通过这些办法减少了农、牧和蒙、汉人民之间的纠纷，加强了民族团结。但是当农、牧业生产还是建立在分散的、个体经济基础上的时候，人为的农、牧业生产之间的矛盾很难彻底解决。农民为着自己耕作的方便，常常乱开荒；牧民为着自己放牧的方便，也常常破坏农田。有的地方，牧民要保护草场，而农民为了解决烧柴困难，却去挖草根，砍沙蒿。因此，在农民、牧民之间，在村和村、区和区、旗县和旗县之间，经常为着这些事情发生纠纷。政府不断调解处理，问题仍不断发生。组织农、牧业结合的生产合作社，就可以比较彻底地解决这些问题。由于合作社以集体的方式经营农、牧业，也就可以在当地政府领导下，合理地划分和使用农田、牧场。农民和牧民由于生产而引起的矛盾消失了，而且农、牧业也密切地结合起来，互相支援。蒙族牧民和汉族农民在合作社里共同劳动，互相学习生产技术，互助互利。这样，他们就在新的生产关系中建立了牢不可破的民族友谊。所以，蒙、汉族社员称赞自己的合作社说：庄稼长好了，牲畜膘满了，蒙民、汉民都高兴。
