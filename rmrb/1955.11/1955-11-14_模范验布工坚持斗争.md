　  Model Fabric Inspector Persists in Struggle
    Youth League member Zhou Baoli is an excellent fabric inspector at the Ningbo Local State-Owned Yonghua Textile Factory in Zhejiang. No substandard fabric can pass through his hands.

    Such a good worker was resented and attacked by Sun Linghua, the Party Branch Secretary, and Cheng Heting, the Factory Director, among others.

    Sun Linghua and the others felt that if Zhou Baoli continued to do things this way, the factory would be unable to "complete" its quality plan, and their personal reputations would be tarnished. Initially, they secretly sold substandard fabric as good fabric without Zhou Baoli's knowledge. Then, they asked Zhou Baoli to be more "flexible" with the fabric inspection standards. But Zhou Baoli refused. Sun Linghua then discussed it with the Factory Director and, on some pretext, transferred Zhou Baoli to do statistical work, replacing him with a female worker who did not understand the technical standards.

    Zhou Baoli was not discouraged by these people. He reported the matter of being attacked to the leadership organs and actively assisted the new fabric inspector in becoming familiar with the technology and encouraged her to adhere to the fabric inspection standards. Finally, the Ningbo Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party investigated and dealt with this matter. Sun Linghua was dismissed from her post, and Zhou Baoli finally won victory!

　  模范验布工坚持斗争
    青年团员周宝利是浙江宁波地方国营甬华布厂的优秀验布工人。在他的手下，不合标准的布匹休想出厂。
    这样一个好工人，竟遭到了党支部书记孙玲花和厂长程鹤亭等人的忌恨和打击。
    孙玲花他们觉得，照周宝利这种做，工厂就无法“完成”质量计划，个人的面子也不光彩。开始，他们瞒着周宝利，把次布当好布卖出。接着，他们要周宝利掌握验布标准“灵活”些。但周宝利不答应。孙玲花就和厂长商量好，借故把周宝利调去做统计工作，另调一个不懂技术标准的女工来代替他。
    周宝利在这些人面前并不气馁。他把受打击的事向领导机关反映了，同时积极协助新的验布工人熟悉技术，并鼓励她坚持掌握验布标准。最后，中共宁波市委检查、处理了这件事情，孙玲花被撤职，周宝利终于得到胜利！
