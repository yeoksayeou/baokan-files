    The agricultural cooperative movement is a conscious action of millions of people under the leadership of the Party. The more extensive the mass movement, the more it needs to rely on the masses, especially the most determined and active people in rural areas who are engaged in socialism, to lead the broadest masses. The Communist Youth League and the vast rural working youth are a force that the Party can trust and rely on. Young people are sensitive to new things, they yearn for a new life, and do not miss the old things. In addition, they have seen the benefits of cooperation to them, so they are very active in running cooperatives.
    However, in some places, they do not actively support the enthusiasm of young people for labor, and do not boldly use them. Instead, they adopt a wrong attitude of indifference and ridicule. This is a serious blow to the enthusiasm of the masses. According to the instructions in Comrade Mao Zedong's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation": "We should cherish any small socialist enthusiasm of farmers and cadres, and should not frustrate it." Although the knowledge and experience of young people cannot be compared with the older generation, young people have drive, and knowledge and experience can be increased in actual struggle. Therefore, the attitude towards young people should be: if they have enough energy, let them use it; if they are not capable enough, train them. This is an extremely important principle for us to give play to the enthusiasm of young people and cultivate and educate young people.
    Of course, this does not mean that young people have fully understood the great significance of the socialist transformation of agriculture, and have fully understood the Party's class policy in rural areas and how to run cooperatives well. Because young people lack experience more than adults, they need to strengthen education and leadership. At present, special attention must be paid to organizing all members of the Communist Youth League and the vast number of young people to conscientiously study Comrade Mao Zedong's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" and the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party on the question of agricultural cooperation. At a time when cooperatives have developed in large numbers, young people should pay more attention to resolutely implementing the Party's policies, fight against all phenomena that violate the Party's policies, become models in implementing the Party's policies, ensure the quality of cooperatives, and make cooperatives more and better. The Party and the Communist Youth League organizations should boldly publicize the good people and good deeds among the young people, vigorously support the young people to overcome all difficulties, strive to overcome shortcomings, correct errors in their work, and fight against all kinds of bad people and bad deeds that undermine the cooperative movement.
    Since the Party's general line has been widely publicized throughout the country, rural youth in various places have enthusiastically responded to the Party's call, and under the leadership of the Communist Youth League, they have taken the lead in joining the cooperatives and working enthusiastically. They have shown great enthusiasm and creativity in collecting grain, reclaiming wasteland for afforestation, and carrying out the "thousands of vehicles and ten thousand loads" of fertilizer accumulation campaign. Many of the so-called "spontaneous cooperatives" in various places were set up by young people. In the seven counties of Anyang Prefecture, Henan, members of the Communist Youth League set up 424 spontaneous cooperatives. Various places have also organized nearly 200,000 youth production shock brigades, and they have played a great role in taking the lead in overcoming difficulties, implementing technical improvements, and improving labor productivity.
    The agricultural cooperative movement needs a large number of cooperative management backbones, a large number of accountants, technicians, feeders, farm implement workers, production team leaders and group leaders, etc. These people will mainly grow up from rural youth. At the same time, due to the needs of developing agricultural cooperatives and the favorable conditions for young people to learn brought about by collective labor, the enthusiasm of rural youth for learning is extremely high. They are eager to learn culture and technology, and eager to learn more skills in running cooperatives and production skills. They actively participate in spare-time cultural learning and the literacy campaign, explore new knowledge and technology with great enthusiasm, and are determined to dedicate their strength to the great cause of building socialism. This year, in Hebei Province alone, young people have implemented artificial detasseling and pollination of corn on more than 3.6 million mu of land, which is estimated to increase production by more than 50 million jin. Many other places have also established work-recording study classes and technical transfer stations, and signed package teaching and learning contracts with technical promotion stations. These methods have a great effect on accelerating the elimination of illiteracy and cultivating new technical forces. The leadership of the Party and the League should actively support and widely promote them. It must be recognized that if there is only social reform of agriculture, but no cultural revolution in rural areas; if a large number of illiterate people continue to exist in rural areas, retaining backward production technologies and old habits of life, it indicates that socialism has not finally defeated capitalism. We must accelerate the elimination of illiteracy, more actively organize the popularization of books and newspapers in rural areas, and more widely publicize new agricultural technologies, so that the cultural life of rural areas will keep up with the development of the agricultural cooperative movement.
    The key to giving play to the positive role of rural youth in the agricultural cooperative movement is the leadership of the Party, especially the county and district committees of the Party, which should strengthen their leadership over the work of the Communist Youth League and rural youth. When making comprehensive plans for agricultural cooperation, the Party committees in various places should include mobilizing young people, cultivating technical forces, and eliminating illiteracy in the plans. They should integrate the rectification of societies and building of societies, and the rectification of the Party and building of the Party with the rectification of the League and building of the League. It must be recognized that the 8 million members of the Communist Youth League in rural areas are the shock force and the closest assistant of the Party in realizing the agricultural cooperative movement. However, at present, the rural Communist Youth League is far from meeting the requirements of cooperative development in terms of both quantity and quality. The resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party on the question of agricultural cooperation pointed out: "Strengthening the Party and Communist Youth League branches is the key to running the cooperative well." Therefore, it is necessary to actively and under leadership strengthen the work of rectifying and building the League. The work of rectifying and building the League should mainly be carried out in the rectification of societies and building of societies, and the rectification of the Party and building of the Party, so as to strengthen the leading core of the grassroots organizations of the League, improve the quality of League members, and absorb new active members into the League.
    To give play to the role of the Communist Youth League, attention must be paid to correctly using the cadres of the Communist Youth League. Only when the cadres of the League are closely integrated with the organization of the League can the organization of the Communist Youth League play its due fighting role. In the past, some Party committees sent most or even all of the cadres of the Communist Youth League to "squat on the spot" for a long time, using them entirely as work teams, which was inappropriate. In this way, the League organization loses its leadership and is prone to the malpractice of doing everything by oneself. In the future, the Party committees in various places should, on the one hand, urge the cadres of the Communist Youth League to go deep into reality, conduct investigations and research, and strengthen specific guidance to grassroots organizations; on the other hand, they should also allow the Communist Youth League to have more time to hold some mass and professional meetings, so that the cadres of the Communist Youth League can combine summing up experience with mobilizing the masses more closely.
    Starting from the point of view of cultivating and educating, combining the task of attracting young people to participate in the socialist transformation of agriculture with the task of educating young people in the spirit of communism, we can give full play to the positive role of young people in the agricultural cooperative movement, continuously cultivate new talents and labor reserves, and vigorously promote the great socialist construction cause of our country.

### 发挥农村青年在农业合作化运动中的积极作用

    发挥农村青年在农业合作化运动中的积极作用
    农业合作化运动是党领导下的千百万群众的自觉行动。愈是广泛的群众运动也就愈加需要依靠群众，特别是要依靠农村中搞社会主义最坚决最积极的人来带动最广大的群众。青年团和广大农村劳动青年，是党的一支可以信任和可以依靠的力量。青年对新鲜事物敏感，他们向往新生活，不留恋旧事物，加上亲眼看到合作化给他们带来的好处，所以他们对办合作社十分积极。
    但是，有些地方对于青年这种劳动热情却不积极支持，不大胆使用，反而采取冷淡和嘲笑的错误态度。这对于群众的积极性是一个严重的挫伤。按照毛泽东同志“关于农业合作化问题”的报告中的指示：“我们应当爱惜农民和干部的任何一点微小的社会主义积极性，而不应当去挫折它。”虽然，青年的知识和经验不能同老一辈相比，但是青年有干劲，知识和经验则可以在实际斗争中得到增长。因此对于青年人所采取的态度，就是应该：他们劲头足，就去发挥它；他们本事不大，就去培养它。这是我们发挥青年积极性和培养教育青年的一条极重要的原则。
    当然，这并不是说青年们已经完全理解了农业的社会主义改造的伟大意义，已经完全懂得党在农村的阶级政策和如何办好合作社的办法。由于青年比起成年人更缺乏经验，所以更需要加强教育和领导。目前必须特别注意组织全体青年团员和广大青年认真学习毛泽东同志“关于农业合作化问题”的报告和党的七届六中全会（扩大）关于农业合作化问题的决议。在合作社已经大量发展起来的时候，青年们要更多注意坚决贯彻执行党的政策，同一切违反党的政策的现象作斗争，成为执行党的政策的模范，保证合作社的质量，使合作社办得更多而且办得更好。党和青年团的组织，应当放手地宣扬青年群众中间的好人好事，大力支持青年战胜一切困难，努力克服缺点，纠正工作中的错误，并同破坏合作化运动的各种各样的坏人坏事作斗争。
    党的总路线在全国广泛宣传以来，各地农村青年，热烈响应党的号召，在青年团的带领下积极带头入社，热情地劳动，在收拣粮食、开荒造林、开展“千车万担”的积肥运动中，表现了很大的积极性和创造性。各地的所谓“自发社”，许多就是青年人办起来的。河南安阳专区七个县，团员就办了四百二十四个自发社。各地还组织了青年生产突击队近二十万个，他们在带头克服困难，实行技术改良，提高劳动生产率上起了很大作用。
    农业合作化运动需要大批的办社骨干，需要大批的会计员、技术员、饲养员、农具手、生产队长和组长等。这些人主要将从农村青年中生长起来。同时由于发展农业合作社的需要，由于集体劳动给青年的学习带来了有利条件，农村青年的学习情绪极为高涨。他们迫切要求学习文化，学习技术，渴望自己能学到更多的办社本领和生产本领。他们积极参加业余文化学习和扫盲运动，以巨大的热情探求新的知识和技术，并决心把自己的力量献给建设社会主义的伟大事业。今年单是河北省，青年施行玉米人工去雄授粉的土地就有三百六十多万亩，估计将增产五千多万斤。还有很多地方成立了记工学习班，技术传授站，同技术推广站订立包教包学合同，这些办法对加速扫除文盲和培养新的技术力量，都有很大作用，党和团的领导都应当积极支持，普遍推广。必须认识，如果只有农业的社会改革，而没有农村的文化革命；如果让农村中大量的文盲继续存在，保留着落后的生产技术和旧的生活习惯，那就表明，社会主义还没有最后战胜资本主义。我们必须加速扫除文盲，更积极地组织通俗书报下乡，更广泛地宣传新的农业技术，使农村的文化生活紧紧跟上农业合作化运动的发展。
    发挥农村青年在农业合作化运动中的积极作用的关键，是党的领导，特别是党的县委、区委要加强对青年团、对农村青年工作的领导。各地党委在作农业合作化的全面规划时，应当把发动青年，培养技术力量，扫除文盲等一起规划在内，应当在整社建社，整党建党的同时结合整团建团。必须认识，现在农村中八百万团员，是党在实现农业合作化运动中的突击力量和最亲密的助手。但是，目前农村青年团不论在数量上和质量上都还远远赶不上合作化发展的要求。党的七届六中全会（扩大）关于农业合作化问题的决议中指出：“健全党和青年团的支部，是办好合作社的关键”，因此必须积极地、有领导地加强整团建团工作。整团建团的工作主要应当在整社建社和整党建党中进行，做到加强团的基层组织领导核心，提高团员的质量和吸收新的积极分子入团。
    发挥青年团的作用，必须注意正确地使用青年团的干部，只有团的干部和团的组织紧密结合在一起的时候，青年团这个组织才能发挥它应有的战斗作用。过去有些党委把青年团干部的大部甚至全部长期派去“蹲点”，完全当作工作队来使用，这是不恰当的。这样，既使团组织失去领导，又容易产生包办代替的弊病。今后各地党委应当一方面督促青年团干部深入实际，调查研究，加强对基层组织的具体指导；另方面还应当让青年团有更多一点的时间召开一些群众性和专业性的会议，以便青年团干部能够把总结经验同发动群众更紧密地结合起来。
    从培养教育观点出发，把吸引青年参加农业的社会主义改造事业同以共产主义精神教育青年的任务结合起来，我们就能充分发挥青年在农业合作化运动中的积极作用，不断地培养出新的人材和劳动后备，有力地推进我国伟大的社会主义建设事业。
