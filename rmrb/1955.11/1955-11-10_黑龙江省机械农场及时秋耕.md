Heilongjiang Province's nineteen state-run mechanical farms have mobilized over three hundred tractors for autumn tillage since the fall, and have now plowed 46,300 hectares. The Jiusan Farm, in addition to allocating some tractors for land reclamation for immigrants, also organized the entire farm's tractors to rush plowing during the rainy autumn season, completing all 8,963 hectares of wheat stubble land autumn tillage tasks. The Erlongshan, Tongbei, and Hongxing mechanical farms are also nearing completion of their more than 12,000 hectares of autumn plowing tasks. Autumn tillage effectively restores soil fertility, resists drought and preserves moisture, and ensures timely sowing in the coming year, making it an important measure for increasing production in agricultural production. Although northern parts of the province suffered severe drought in July and August this year, most crops were sown on land that was autumn-tilled last year, so they still achieved a good harvest. The land tilled this autumn will lay the foundation for another bumper harvest next year.

    黑龙江省机械农场及时秋耕
    黑龙江省十九个国营机械农场，入秋以来出动三百多台拖拉机进行秋耕，现在已经翻地四万六千三百公顷。九三农场除抽出一部分机车为移民开荒外，并在秋季多雨季节，组织全场拖拉机抢耕，已经全部完成八千九百六十三公顷麦槎田秋耕任务。二龙山、通北、红星三机械农场一万二千多公顷秋翻地任务，也接近完成。秋耕能够有效地恢复地力、抗旱保墒，保证来年适期播种，在农业生产上是一项重要的增产措施。今年该省北部虽在七八月间遭受严重旱灾，但是由于大部分农作物播种在去年秋翻的土地上，所以仍获丰收。今年秋耕过的土地，又将为明年丰收奠定基础。
