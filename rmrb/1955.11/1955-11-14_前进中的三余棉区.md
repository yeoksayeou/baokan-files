　　The Advancing Sanyu Cotton Region
　　Shi Yue'e
    In the Sanyu cotton region on the coast of the Yellow Sea in northern Jiangsu, the average yield of Dai-character cotton this year is 190 jin of seed cotton per mu, 20 jin more than the bumper harvest of 1953. During the autumn harvest season, a scene of abundance prevails everywhere. Huge cotton bolls surround the coffee-colored cotton stalks as if inlaid with layers of "platinum." In the fields, cotton-picking girls nimbly pluck the cotton. On the roads, groups of young men and women push carts and ride bicycles, delivering the newly picked cotton to the cotton purchasing stations. The fine-quality ginning factories have piled up mountains of cotton five or six zhang high. The ginning machines roar day and night. From morning till dusk, fleets of large boats loaded with new cotton continuously sail along the Zha River in the Sanyu region towards Qinglong Port and Tangjia闸. The fastest can be transported to Shanghai, Nantong, and other textile bases on the same day.

    The cotton farmers in the bountiful Sanyu region conscientiously fulfill the state's pre-purchase contracts and enthusiastically sell their cotton to the state. By October 17, they had already sold 3.22 million jin of ginned cotton to the state, completing the state's purchase plan for September and October ahead of schedule.

    The Sanyu cotton region basically achieved collectivization last year. After this year's bumper cotton harvest, production investment in agricultural cooperatives has greatly increased, with each cooperative having several thousand to ten thousand yuan in public accumulation funds. Taking the socialist road first is the pressing demand of the cotton farmers. Several cooperatives have submitted reports requesting to merge and form larger cooperatives. The tractor drivers at the Sanyu Agricultural Machinery Station are also busily assembling the newly arrived nine Polish tractors, preparing to put them into autumn plowing immediately. The area plowed by tractors in the autumn will be twenty times larger than this spring, and next spring it will be twice as large as this autumn. Many farmers plan to plant an additional crop of wheat and are working day and night to build wide roads and bridges for the tractors to drive on, preparing for the autumn plowing with tractors. The rich Sanyu cotton region is advancing on the road of collectivization and mechanization, and it will produce more high-quality cotton for the country.

　　前进中的三余棉区
　　史越峨
    在苏北黄海边上有一个三余棉区，这里的岱字棉今年平均每亩收一百九十斤籽棉，比丰收的一九五三年每亩多收二十斤。秋收季节里，到处洋溢着丰收景象。硕大的棉朵围在咖啡色的棉秸上好像镶了几层“白金”，田间采棉姑娘们轻巧地采摘棉花。公路上，成群的男女青年推着小车，踏着自行车，把刚摘下来的新棉送到棉花收购站，良种轧花厂又堆积起一座座五、六丈高的棉花山。轧花机日夜不息地发出轰轰隆隆的响声。清晨到傍晚、三余区闸河里满载新花的大船队伍，连续不断地驶往青龙港、唐家闸。最快的，当天就可运到上海、南通等纺织基地。
    丰收的三余区棉农，认真执行国家预购合同，踊跃把棉花卖给国家。到十月十七日已卖给国家三百二十二万斤皮棉，国家九、十两月份的收购计划已提前完成。
    三余棉区去年已经基本合作化了，今年棉花丰收后，农业合作社里的生产投资大大增加，每社公积金都有数千元到一万元。先一步走社会主义道路是当前棉农的迫切要求，有好几个合作社打报告要求联合起来办大社。三余农业机器站的拖拉机手们也正在紧张地装配新运来的九台波兰拖拉机，准备马上投入秋耕。拖拉机秋耕面积将比今春扩大二十倍，明春又将比今年秋耕扩大两倍。许多农民都打算多种一熟小麦，正在日夜赶修宽阔的行驶拖拉机的路和桥，迎接拖拉机秋耕。富饶的三余棉区正在合作化、机械化的道路上前进，它将为国家生产更多的优良棉花。
