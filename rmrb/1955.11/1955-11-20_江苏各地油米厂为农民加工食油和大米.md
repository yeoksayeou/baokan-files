Oil and rice processing plants in various parts of Jiangsu Province are actively processing edible oil and rice for farmers, which has been widely welcomed. According to the results of organized processing in various places, every 100 jin of soybeans processed by the factory yields about 2 jin more oil than traditional pressing methods. Machine milling of rice yields 3 to 5 jin more rice per 100 jin of paddy compared to traditional milling. In Taixing County alone, organizing the soybeans remaining in the hands of farmers for factory processing can increase soybean oil production by 500,000 jin, enough for 160,000 farmers to eat for a year. Eight rice mills in Xinghua city processed for farmers for three months, increasing rice production by 1.56 million jin. Yizheng County processed 8 million jin of paddy for farmers, increasing rice production by 240,000 jin, saving more than 10,000 labor days and more than 20,000 cattle work days. Jiangdu County also relocated thirteen rice mills to rice-producing areas to facilitate timely processing for farmers. Some rice mills also adopted a registration by appointment method, which was welcomed by farmers. (Xu Shenxing)

　　江苏各地油米厂为农民加工食油和大米
    江苏省各地油、米加工厂积极为农民加工食油和大米，受到农民普遍欢迎。根据各地组织加工的结果，每百斤大豆由工厂加工比土榨多出油二斤左右，机器碾米每百斤稻谷比土碾多出大米三斤到五斤。仅泰兴一个县，将留在农民手里的大豆组织起来由工厂进行加工，即可增产豆油五十万斤，足够十六万农民一年的食用。兴化城区八个米厂为农民加工三个月，就增产大米一百五十六万斤。仪征县为农民加工了八百万斤稻谷，增产大米二十四万斤，节省了一万多个劳动力和两万多个牛工。江都县还迁移了十三家米厂到产稻区，便利农民及时加工，部分米厂并采用预约登记的办法，受到农民的欢迎。　（徐慎行）
