    "Village People's Assembly Hall"
    As early as 1953, Fangkou Village, Fangkou Township, Sheng County, Zhejiang Province, built a "People's Assembly Hall" that could accommodate 1,500 people, modeled after the county's People's Assembly Hall. Recently, eight more administrative villages have planned to build "Village People's Assembly Halls." Luo Village started construction on September 1st. The Xiaoxu Village First Agricultural Cooperative in Chengnan Township, Yunhe County, also included in its cooperative plan to build an auditorium, club, and health room this winter, and to build a pigsty, basketball court, and health station, and install radios next year. What grand style! This ostentatious approach increases the burden on the masses and detaches them from the masses. For example, in order to build the "People's Assembly Hall," Luo Village "mobilized" each person to contribute seventeen days of compulsory labor. The masses said, "The trees on the mountain are cut down, and more than 200 mu of fields at the foot of the mountain are affected by disasters." This completely violates the principle of running cooperatives diligently and thriftily; this is a policy of wasting manpower and resources.
    District cadres are often stationed in Fangkou Township. They all know about the construction of the "People's Assembly Hall" in the township. The Ningbo Prefectural Wood Inspection Station even sent people to investigate the phenomenon of large-scale tree felling in the village and reported the situation to the county leadership in a timely manner, but it did not attract their attention. This bureaucratic style of the county has condoned this extravagant and wasteful atmosphere.

    “村人民大会堂”
    浙江省嵊县方口乡的方口村早在一九五三年就仿照县人民大会堂的形式，修了一个可容一千五百人的“人民大会堂”。最近又有八个行政村计划建造“村人民大会堂”。罗村在九月一日已经动工。云和县城南乡小徐村第一农业社在社内规划中也订出要在今冬修好大礼堂、俱乐部、保健室，明年再建筑养猪屋一处，修建篮球场、保健站，装置收音机。真是好大的派头！这种讲究排场的作法，增加了群众的负担，脱离了群众。如罗村为了修“人民大会堂”，“动员”每人作义务工十七个，群众说：“山上林木砍光，山下二百多亩田遭灾。”这完全违反了勤俭办社的方针，这是劳民伤财的方针。
    方口乡经常驻有区干部，该乡大建“人民大会堂”的事他们都知道，宁波专署的木材检查站还派人去调查过该村大砍树木的现象，把这种情况及时向该县领导机关报告过，可是并没有引起他们的注意。该县这种官僚主义作风就纵容了这种铺张浪费的风气。
