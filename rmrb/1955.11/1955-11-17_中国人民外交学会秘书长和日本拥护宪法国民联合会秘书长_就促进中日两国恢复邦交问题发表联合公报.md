Xinhua News Agency, 16th: Joint Communiqué on Promoting the Restoration of Diplomatic Relations Between China and Japan Issued by the Secretary-General of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs and the Secretary-General of the Japanese National Federation for the Protection of the Constitution.

The Secretary-General of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, Wu Mao-sun, and the Secretary-General of the Japanese National Federation for the Protection of the Constitution, Ohno Koichi, issued a joint communiqué on the 16th. The full text is as follows:

On November 15, 1955, Premier Zhou Enlai of the People's Republic of China received all members of the Japanese National Federation for the Protection of the Constitution Delegation to China, headed by Mr. Tetsu Katayama, Chairman of the Japanese National Federation for the Protection of the Constitution. Premier Zhou Enlai and Chairman Katayama fully exchanged views on the issue of promoting the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Japan in a harmonious and friendly atmosphere, and reached a consensus based on the following fundamental spirit.

Premier Zhou Enlai and Chairman Katayama unanimously agreed that countries should coexist peacefully and should resolve disputes and outstanding issues through peaceful consultations, rather than resorting to force. The People's Republic of China, which adheres to a policy of peace, respects the Japanese people's peaceful aspiration to declare the permanent renunciation of war as a means. The people of China and Japan are willing to guarantee mutual respect for national sovereignty, non-aggression, and non-interference in each other's internal affairs, in order to safeguard peace and security in the Far East.

In the two-thousand-year history of Sino-Japanese relations, China and Japan have been at peace with each other for a long time. After the end of World War II, the common experience caused and is still causing a fundamental change in the feelings of the people of China and Japan. The Chinese people deeply understand the situation of the Japanese people. The people of China and Japan should establish long-term friendly and good-neighborly relations in a new environment and on a new basis, and should first work together to promote the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Japan.

All issues between China and Japan should and can be resolved through peaceful consultations, and force or the threat of force should never be used.

The Japanese people's movement for peace against rearmament and the movement to defend the peaceful constitution are very beneficial to promoting the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Japan and enhancing the friendly relations between the two peoples.

The above is hereby announced.

    一九五五年十一月十五日，中华人民共和国周恩来总理接见了以日本拥护宪法国民联合会主席片山哲先生为团长的日本拥护宪法国民联合会访华团全体团员。周恩来总理和片山哲团长在融洽友好的空气中就促进中日两国恢复邦交的问题充分地交换了意见，并且根据下述基本精神取得了一致的意见。
    周恩来总理和片山哲团长一致认为，国家和国家之间应该和平相处，并且应该用和平协商的方法解决彼此间的争端和悬案，而不应该诉诸武力。坚持和平政策的中华人民共和国尊重日本人民宣布永久放弃战争手段的和平愿望。中日两国人民愿意保证互相尊重国家主权，互不侵犯和互不干涉内政，以有利于保障远东的和平和安全。
    在两千年的中日关系史中，中日两国在长时期内，曾经是和平相处的。第二次世界大战结束后，又由于相同的遭遇使中日两国人民在感情上发生了并且正在经历着根本的变化。中国人民深切地理解日本人民的处境。中日两国人民应该在新的环境和基础上建立长远的友好睦邻关系，并且首先应该为促进中日两国邦交的恢复而共同努力。
    中日两国间的一切问题应该而且可以用和平协商的方法求得解决，绝不应该使用武力或武力威胁。
    日本人民为和平而进行的反对重整军备的运动和拥护和平宪法的运动，对促进中日两国恢复邦交和增进两国人民的友好关系是非常有利的。
