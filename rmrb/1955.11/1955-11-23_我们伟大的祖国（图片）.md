Our Great Motherland
The over two million mu of "Victory No. 100" sweet potatoes that were replanted in various parts of Anhui Province this year have generally yielded a bumper harvest. The average yield per mu is estimated to be around 2,000 jin, more than double that of ordinary sweet potatoes. The best yields reached 6,000 jin per mu. This is a picture of members of the Chendao Agricultural Production Cooperative in Northwest Township, Sixian County, Anhui Province, selecting high-quality "Victory No. 100" sweet potatoes in preparation for expanding the planting area next year.
