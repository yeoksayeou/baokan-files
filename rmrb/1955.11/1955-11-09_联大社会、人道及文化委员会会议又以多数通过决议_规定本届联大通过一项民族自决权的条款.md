Xinhua News Agency, New York, 8th: At the United Nations General Assembly's Social, Humanitarian and Cultural Committee meeting discussing the draft human rights convention recognizing the clause on national self-determination, the attempt by the United States, Britain and other colonial powers to obstruct the current General Assembly from making a decision on this clause suffered another defeat on the 7th.

As previously reported, the colonial powers had tried hard to obstruct the discussion of this clause by the General Assembly, but had repeatedly failed. During the discussion, they openly opposed the passage of the clause on national self-determination, and raised various "objections." On the 2nd, Denmark again used these "objections" as an excuse to suggest postponing the decision on this clause to a later General Assembly.

However, Denmark's suggestion was not accepted by the committee. On the 7th, the committee passed Ecuador's suggestion by a vote of 35 to 13, stipulating that a clause on national self-determination should be adopted at the current United Nations General Assembly, and that a nine-member subcommittee should be established to consider the opinions raised in the discussion, and to draft a clause on national self-determination no later than November 19, so that it can be adopted in the committee. Britain, Denmark and other countries voted against this suggestion, and the United States abstained from voting.

    联大社会、人道及文化委员会会议又以多数通过决议
    规定本届联大通过一项民族自决权的条款
    新华社八日讯　纽约消息：在联合国大会社会、人道及文化委员会讨论人权公约草案承认民族自决权条款中，美、英等殖民国家阻挠本届大会就这项条款作出决定的企图在七日又一次遭到了失败。
    前已报道，殖民国家曾经竭力阻挠大会讨论这项条款，但是一再遭到过失败。在讨论过程中，它们公然反对通过民族自决权条款，提出各种“异议”。丹麦在二日又以这些“异议”为借口，建议推迟到以后的大会上再对这项条款作出决定。
    但是丹麦的建议并没有为委员会接受，委员会在七日以三十五票对十三票通过了厄瓜多尔建议，规定要在本届联合国大会上通过一项民族自决权的条款，并且规定成立一个九人小组委员会考虑讨论中提出的意见，在不迟于十一月十九日以前拟出一项关于民族自决权的条款，以便在委员会中通过。英国、丹麦等国投票反对这个建议，美国在表决中弃权。
