　  Acquisition work should not be treated like this
    Since the autumn acquisition this year, the ?璵 cotton acquisition point in Chongming County, Jiangsu Province, has frequently experienced a disconnection of acquisition funds. This acquisition point ran out of funds three times on September 21st and 22nd. The last time, with no money to pay, they used the excuse that it was getting late and stopped acquiring cotton. As a result, one hundred and forty-eight farmers had to carry their cotton back home. The same thing happened at the Yuelai acquisition point in Haimen County. Because the Yuelai acquisition point did not have money to acquire cotton, they adopted a deceptive method, saying to the farmers: "Today the selling price will be lower, tomorrow the selling price will be higher!" When the farmers questioned the acquisition personnel, "What kind of acquisition policy is this?" the acquisition personnel were speechless. After these things happened, they should have attracted their attention and been corrected in time. However, some acquisition personnel still hold an indifferent attitude, thinking that "waiting one or two hours is nothing," or thinking that "the masses' opinions are not very big."
    It should be reminded to these staff members that your practice will only dampen the enthusiasm of farmers to sell cotton and affect the country's early control of industrial raw materials. The state calls on farmers to sell cotton quickly in four ways (pick quickly, sort quickly, dry quickly, and sell quickly), and also requires you to receive and transport it quickly.

　  不能这样对待收购工作
    今年秋季收购以来，江苏崇明县?璵棉花收购点经常发生收购资金脱节的现象。这个收购点在九月二十一、二十二两天脱款三次，最后一次无款可付，就借口天晚不收，结果有一百四十八个农民将棉花重新背回家去。同样的事情在海门县悦来收购点也发生过。悦来收购点因没钱不能收购，竟采取了欺骗手法，向农民说：“今天卖价钱要低一点，明天卖价钱要高一点！”当农民责问收购人员“这是什么收购政策”的时候，收购人员无话可答。这些事情发生以后，照理应该引起他们重视，及时改正。但是有些收购人员依旧抱着无所谓的态度，认为“等上一个两个钟点不算什么”，或者认为“群众意见并不大”。
    应当提醒这些工作人员，你们这种做法只会打击农民售棉的热情，影响国家早日掌握工业原料。国家号召农民卖棉做到四快（快拾、快拣、快晒、快卖），同时也要求你们做到快收、快运。
