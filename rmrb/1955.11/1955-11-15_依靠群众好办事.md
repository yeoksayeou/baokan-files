　　Relying on the Masses Makes Things Easy
    Since October, a new atmosphere has emerged in the production of the Guilin Comb Factory. The proportion of second-grade products produced by some workers was one-fifth in late September, but it decreased to one-tenth in early October, and by mid-October, all second-grade products had been eliminated. In the past, the factory's daily output was 350 combs, but now the daily output is 450 combs. Why has the quality of the factory's products been able to improve so quickly, and at the same time, increase the output? Because a broad mass of workers were mobilized to participate in the quality inspection work, and each production team organized inspection groups. The workers' enthusiasm was brought into play, resulting in improved quality and increased output.
    The Tianjin Alcohol Factory had many problems in safety production in the past. For example, workers had repeatedly raised the issue of adding ventilation equipment in the fermentation room to eliminate carbon dioxide and repairing safety valves to prevent steam leakage, but they had not been resolved until recently. There were also some issues that were not taken seriously by the leadership even when they were raised in the past, but recently all seven suggestions made by the workers have been addressed. Some have been incorporated into the workshop's operating plan for November, with designated personnel responsible for implementation, and some are planned to be incorporated into the 1956 annual safety technology organizational measures plan for implementation. What is the reason for this? Because the factory established a "Safety Production Supervision Platform" since October, which greatly inspired the workers' enthusiasm for supervision. Facts have proven that as long as the masses are mobilized and relied upon, things will definitely be done better.

　　依靠群众好办事
    从十月份以来，桂林制篦厂的生产上开始出现了新气象。有的工人生产的二级品，九月下旬还占五分之一，十月上旬就减少到十分之一，到十月中旬二级品已经全部消灭。过去这个厂的日产量是三百五十把，现在的日产量已经是四百五十把了。为什么这个工厂产品的质量能够很快提高，而且同时还提高了产量呢？因为发动了广大工人参加了检查质量的工作，每个生产小组都组织了检查小组。工人们积极性发挥的结果，就是质量提高，产量也提高。
    天津酒精厂，过去在安全生产方面有很多问题。比如发酵室增添通风设备排除二氧化碳的问题和修理安全阀防止跑汽的问题，工人已经提过多次，一直没有解决，而最近解决了。还有一些问题，过去即使提出，领导上也不大重视，而最近工人提的七项建议都有了交代，有的编入十一月份车间作业计划，指定专人负责执行，有的准备编入一九五六年度安全技术组织措施计划中去执行。这是什么原因呢？因为这个厂从十月以来设立了“安全生产监督台”，极大地启发了工人监督的积极性。事实证明，只要发动群众，依靠群众，事情一定会办得更好些。
