Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 22nd -- According to Lao news: The Royal Lao Government is intensifying its unilateral election activities, excluding the Lao Fighting Units from participating. The election campaign began on November 15th. The election is scheduled to be held on December 25th. Out of the more than two million people in Laos, only about 250,000 have the right to vote. Women, the elderly, monks, and others are not eligible to participate in the election.

In particular, the Royal Government has consistently rejected the reasonable proposals put forward by the Lao Fighting Units regarding participation in the election, in accordance with the spirit of the Geneva Accords.

The main political parties participating in the election are the Progressive Party, led by Prime Minister Katay Don Sasorith of the Royal Government, and the Independent Party, led by Foreign Minister Sananikone.

In the province of Pakse in southern Laos, one candidate, Sang Say, has already been arrested by the Royal authorities while campaigning, on the grounds that he was conducting propaganda against Katay. Katay himself is also a candidate for Pakse province.

　　老挝王国政府开始片面竞选
  　竟排除寮国战斗部队参加
    新华社河内二十二日电　据老挝消息：老挝王国政府正在加紧进行排除寮国战斗部队参加的片面选举活动。竞选已经在十一月十五日开始。选举预定在十二月二十五日举行。在老挝二百多万人民中，只有约二十五万人有选举权。妇女、年老人、僧侣等都无权参加选举。
    特别是寮国战斗部队按照日内瓦协议精神提出的有关参加选举的合理建议，一直遭到王国政府的拒绝。
    参加竞选的主要政党有以王国政府首相克特为首的进步党，以及以外交大臣萨纳尼空为首的独立党。
    在老挝南部的巴色省，已经有一名候选人桑赛在进行竞选活动时被王国当局逮捕，罪名是他进行反对克特的宣传。克特本人也是巴色省的候选人。
