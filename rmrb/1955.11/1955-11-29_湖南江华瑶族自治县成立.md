　　Hunan's Jianghua Yao Autonomous County was established on the 25th of this month. At the county people's congress held from the 22nd to the 25th, Zhao Zixian (Yao nationality) was elected as the county head, Zhang Qingling (Han nationality) and Zhou Guozao (Yao nationality) as deputy county heads, and Li Wengao and fourteen others as members of the autonomous county people's committee.

　　Jianghua Yao Autonomous County is a famous timber-producing area in Hunan Province, with a total of more than 208,000 Yao and Han people in the county. Among them, more than 39,000 Yao people mostly lived in high mountains and ridges in the past, living in poverty. Under the leadership of the Party, they were allocated land at the foot of the mountains during the land reform, and each person was also allocated nearly two hundred trees. Now there are twenty forestry production cooperatives and more than seven hundred mutual aid production groups in the Jianghua forest area. Yao farmers have not only developed production and improved their lives, but also more than 2,500 cadres of their own ethnicity have grown up and taken up important positions in many departments.

　　湖南江华瑶族自治县成立
    湖南省江华瑶族自治县在本月二十五日成立。在二十二日到二十五日召开的县人民代表大会上，选举了赵自现（瑶族）为县长，张庆龄（汉族）、周国藻（瑶族）为副县长，李文高等十四人为自治县人民委员会委员。
    江华瑶族自治县是湖南省著名的木材产地，全县有二十万八千多瑶、汉族人民。其中三万九千瑶族人民过去大多生活在高山峻岭上，过着贫困的生活。在党的领导下，他们在土地改革时都在山下分到土地，每人又分到近二百株树木。现在江华林区已有二十个林业生产合作社，七百多个生产互助组。瑶族农民不仅生产发展、生活改善了，而且已有二千五百多名本民族的干部成长起来，担任了许多部门的重要职务。
