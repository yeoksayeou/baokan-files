　　Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway Urumqi-Alashankou Survey and Design Team
　　Completes Reconnaissance Work on Two Border-Reaching Routes
　　(Our newspaper’s dispatch from Lanzhou on the 23rd) The Northwest Railway Design Bureau's Urumqi-Alashankou Survey and Design Team, responsible for route selection for the Urumqi to border section of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, has completed reconnaissance work on the principle route options reaching the border, one from Usu over the Tianshan Mountains to Sandaohezi and the other from Usu along the Usu-Khorgos Highway to Khorgos. They are now braving sub-zero temperatures of more than twenty degrees Celsius, trekking through snow, and advancing from both routes towards Bakhtu in Tacheng and Alashankou on the border.
　　The personnel surveying towards Alashankou are distributed along the coast of Ebi Lake and the northern foothills of the Tianshan Mountains, waiting for the marshlands to freeze before selecting a shorter comparison line. The personnel surveying towards Bakhtu have reached Laofengkou, known for its strong winds, and will soon reach their destination.
　　The Urumqi-Alashankou Survey and Design Team arrived in Urumqi at the end of September and immediately began intensive work. Within two months, they were to complete more than 900 kilometers of preliminary surveying, more than 380 kilometers of reconnaissance, and more than 250 square kilometers of ground control surveying.
　　Working conditions here are difficult, requiring the crossing of mountains over 2,000 meters above sea level, traversing more than 40 kilometers of desert and more than 50 kilometers of marshland. Sometimes, no settlements or water sources are found for days, and they often spend the night in the wilderness. However, thanks to the efforts of the workers and technicians, 80% of the work has been completed, and all outdoor work will be completed as planned on December 5th. They will then return to Urumqi to organize data, compile design opinions, and carry out other preparatory work.

　　兰新铁路乌阿勘测设计队
　　完成两条到达国境线路的踏勘工作
    本报兰州二十三日电　担任兰新铁路乌鲁木齐到国境段选线工作的西北铁路设计分局乌阿勘测设计队，已分别完成了从乌苏翻越天山到三道河子和从乌苏沿乌霍公路到霍尔果斯两条到达国境的原则方案线路的踏勘工作。现在，他们正冒着零下二十多度的严寒，踏着积雪，从两路向国境线上的塔城巴克图和阿拉山口挺进。
    向阿拉山口方向勘测的人员，分布在艾比湖沿岸和天山北麓，等待这里的沼泽地带冻结后，准备再选出一条里程最短的比较线。向巴克图勘测的人员，已到了漩风最大的老风口，不久即可到达目的地。
    乌阿勘测设计队在九月底到达乌鲁木齐后，即投入紧张的工作中。他们要在两个月内，完成九百多公里的草测工作、三百八十多公里的踏勘工作，和二百五十多平方公里的地面控制测绘工作。
    这里的工作条件很困难，要翻越拔海两千多公尺的大山，要通过四十多公里的沙漠和五十多公里的沼泽地带，有时几天看不到人家，几天找不到水，经常露宿在荒山野地上。但是由于工人和技术人员的努力，目前已完成工作量百分之八十，并将在十二月五日按计划全部完成室外工作。接着，他们便要返回乌鲁木齐，整理资料，编制设计意见书和进行其他准备工作。
