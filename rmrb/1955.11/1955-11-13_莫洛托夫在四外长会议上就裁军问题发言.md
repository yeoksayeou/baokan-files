Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, November 12th: Molotov spoke on disarmament at the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference on November 11th, according to TASS.

	Molotov said that the Soviet delegation had the opportunity to study the draft declaration on disarmament issues by the Western three countries and carefully listened to the opinions expressed in support of this draft. Studying the proposals of the Western three countries reveals that it does not meet the requirements of stopping the arms race and banning atomic weapons. It does not include any items on reducing national armaments and banning atomic weapons, nor does it stipulate any practical steps in this regard. This draft does not comply with the resolutions adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1946 and 1954, because this draft does not put forward the task of reducing armaments and banning atomic weapons. It should be frankly said that, based on the suggestions put forward by the Western three countries, the governments of the three countries have abandoned their own suggestions on disarmament issues that they put forward in the United Nations last year. We all remember that the Anglo-French proposal put forward on June 11th last year (which the United States also supported) and similar proposals put forward later once played a beneficial role in bringing the positions of the Soviet Union and the Western three countries closer on the issue of disarmament. The Soviet government's proposal of May 10th also reflected this convergence of positions. But now someone is suggesting that all this be thrown behind us.

	Molotov continued: The draft proposed by the three foreign ministers only vaguely and generally mentions the need to continue discussing disarmament issues. Pineau even said on this issue: "We should admit that we cannot now realize a universal disarmament plan." The meaning of this speech is to refuse disarmament. Macmillan's and Dulles's speeches also held the same meaning. The result is: just as the possibility of the four countries reaching an agreement on some basic issues of disarmament has just appeared, the three countries began to retreat, nullifying the achievements made on the road to reaching an agreement.

	Molotov refuted the argument that the draft declaration of the Western three countries also mentions renouncing the use of atomic weapons. He said, what kind of "renunciation" is this? The three-country draft suggests that all participants agree to renounce "the use of nuclear weapons and all other weapons in any manner inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations." Here, nuclear weapons are lumped together with other types of weapons. In this way, the issue of nuclear weapons, weapons of mass destruction that are particularly dangerous to the people of all countries, is written off. This draft actually wants us to agree to the use of nuclear weapons and attempts to make the act of using nuclear weapons comply with the Charter of the United Nations; naturally, this is impossible. This attempt can only be said to be an intention to use atomic weapons freely. The Soviet delegation certainly cannot agree to this.

	Molotov said: The suggestions of the three foreign ministers actually serve one requirement - to stop making further efforts on the matter of reaching an agreement on reducing armaments and banning atomic weapons. Some people use the excuse of technical difficulties in establishing and implementing supervision over measures to ban atomic weapons, and they try their best to exaggerate the significance of these technical difficulties themselves, in order to emphasize that effective supervision of disarmament is said to be impossible, and therefore disarmament is also impossible. This argument cannot be agreed with in any way.

	Molotov said: I have already clarified the Soviet Union's attitude towards the proposals made by the United States on aerial photography and the exchange of military intelligence on the 10th. But Dulles's speech did not answer the substance of the Soviet opinion. Molotov said that we also hope that the French and British delegations will explain how they believe the Fur and Eden proposals mentioned in the draft declaration should be implemented, because so far only the most general opinions have been put forward on this issue.

	When Molotov talked about the issue of supervision of disarmament, he said that the Soviet Union has always advocated strict international supervision. But don't forget that the first thing we should do is to reach a consensus on the necessity of ending the arms race. But if we abandon the reduction of armaments and the banning of atomic weapons, then what is the use of supervision and inspection?

	Molotov said that Dulles cited a passage from the Soviet Union's proposal of May 10th, which pointed out that science has developed to the point today that supervision itself cannot guarantee that atomic energy is completely used for peaceful purposes, and the possibility of secretly producing atomic weapons still exists. Therefore, supervision and corresponding formal agreements cannot eliminate the danger of a sudden atomic attack. Molotov said that this argument is irrefutable. However, various different conclusions have been drawn from this argument. The Soviet government's starting point is: it is now possible to make progress on the issue of disarmament, including eliminating the danger of atomic attacks in the current situation. First of all, this can be done by morally and politically condemning atomic weapons and taking concrete steps in completely banning this weapon. The Soviet proposal on not being the first to use atomic weapons is based on this purpose. Secondly, we propose to establish observation posts as one of the measures in the overall disarmament plan, and this is exactly what Dulles's speech did not talk about.

	Molotov said: The representatives of the United States, France, and Britain also draw another conclusion, attempting to prove that it is fundamentally impossible to implement measures to reduce armaments and ban atomic weapons in the current situation. The unconvincing nature of this conclusion is very obvious.

	Molotov finally said: The Soviet delegation believes that we can reach an agreement on certain issues at this meeting, first of all on those issues on which we have reached an agreement not long ago. As for those issues on which we have not yet been able to reach an agreement, we can make recommendations agreed upon by everyone for further study by the corresponding United Nations agencies.

### 莫洛托夫在四外长会议上就裁军问题发言

　　莫洛托夫在四外长会议上就裁军问题发言
    新华社十二日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦十二日讯：莫洛托夫十一日在四国外交部长会议上就裁军问题发言。
    莫洛托夫说，苏联代表团有机会研究了西方三国关于裁军问题的声明草案，并且注意地听取了为维护这个草案而发表的意见。研究一下西方三国的建议就可以看出，它是不符合停止扩充军备和禁止原子武器的要求的。它没有包括任何关于裁减各国军备和禁止原子武器的项目，也没有规定这方面的任何实际步骤。这个草案不符合联合国大会在一九四六年以及一九五四年所通过的决议，因为这一草案没有提出裁减军备和禁止原子武器的任务。应该坦率地说，根据西方三国提出的建议来看，三国政府背弃了它们自己去年在联合国所提出的关于裁军问题的建议。我们大家都记得，去年六月十一日提出的英法建议（美国也曾经支持这一个建议）以及以后提出的同类的建议在使苏联和西方三国在裁军的问题上的立场大大趋于接近这方面曾经起了有益的作用。苏联政府五月十日的建议中也反映了这种立场的接近。但是现在却有人建议把这一切都抛置脑后。
    莫洛托夫接着说：三国外交部长提出的草案只是含糊地空泛地讲到必须继续讨论裁军问题。比内并且就这个问题说：“我们应当承认，现在我们不能够实现普遍的裁军计划。”这个发言的意思是要拒绝裁军。麦克米伦和杜勒斯的发言也抱有同样的意思。结果是：在四国就裁军的一些基本问题达成协议的可能性刚刚出现的时候，三国就开始往后退，把在达成协议的道路上所获得的成就化为乌有。
    莫洛托夫驳斥了所谓西方三国的声明草案中也提到放弃使用原子武器的论调。他说，这是怎样的“放弃”呢？三国草案建议，所有的参加者都同意放弃“以任何不符合联合国宪章的方式使用核子武器和一切其他武器”。这里是把核子武器同其他种类的武器混为一谈。这样，就把对各国人民具有特别危险性的大规模毁灭性武器——核子武器的问题一笔勾销。这一草案实际上是要我们同意使用核子武器，而且企图使使用核子武器这一行动也符合联合国宪章；自然，这一点是办不到的。这种企图只能说是打算放手使用原子武器。苏联代表团对此当然不能够同意。
    莫洛托夫说：三国外交部长的建议实际上服务于一个要求——在就裁减军备和禁止原子武器的问题达成协议的事情上停止作进一步的努力。有人借口在建立和实现对禁止原子武器的措施的监督上有技术困难，并且千方百计地夸大这些技术困难的本身意义，以便强调据说对裁军实施有效的监督是不可能的、从而也就是强调连裁军也是不可能的。这种主张是无论如何都不能够同意的。
    莫洛托夫说：我在十日已经阐明了苏联对美国提出的关于空中摄影和交换军事情报的建议的态度。但是杜勒斯的发言并没有答复苏联的意见的实质。莫洛托夫说，我们还希望法国和英国代表团解释一下，他们认为声明草案中提到的富尔和艾登的建议怎样加以实现，因为到现在为止只是对这个问题提出了最一般的意见。
    莫洛托夫在谈到关于裁军的监督问题时说，苏联过去和现在一直主张实行严格的国际监督。但是不要忘记，我们首先应该做的事是就结束军备竞赛的必要性问题取得一致的意见。但是，如果我们放弃裁减军备和禁止原子武器，那么监督和视察又有什么用处呢？
    莫洛托夫说，杜勒斯援引了苏联的五月十日的建议的一段话，这一段话指出，科学发展到了今天，监督本身并不能保证原子能完全用在和平目的上，而且秘密生产原子武器的可能性仍然存在。因此，监督和相应的正式协定并不能消除突然的原子袭击的危险性。莫洛托夫说，这个论点是无可辩驳的。但是，从这个论点得出了种种不同的结论。苏联政府的出发点是：现在有可能在裁军问题上、包括在目前的情况下消除原子袭击的危险的问题上获得进展。首先，这可以用对原子武器作道义上和政治上的谴责以及在完全禁止这一武器方面采取具体步骤的办法来做到，苏联提出的关于不得最先使用原子武器的建议正是基于这一目的。其次，我们建议建立监察所，作为全面裁军计划中的措施之一，而这一点正是杜勒斯的发言中没有谈到的。
    莫洛托夫说：美国、法国和英国的代表还作出另一种结论，企图证明，在目前情况下根本不可能实行裁减军备和禁止原子武器的措施。这种结论的不能使人信服是十分明显的。
    莫洛托夫最后说：苏联代表团认为，我们能够在这次会议上就某些问题达成协议，首先是就我们不久以前曾经达成过协议的那些问题上达成协议。至于我们还不能够取得一致意见的那些问题，我们可以通过大家同意的建议以供联合国相应机构作进一步的研究。
