Xinjiang Builds Four State-Owned Ranches This Year

This year, the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region has completed the construction of four new local state-owned ranches. These are the Hutubi Ranch and the ranches in the Urumqi, Hami, and Aksu regions. These ranches are all economic ranches, raising general livestock to increase the production of animal products for the country, while educating the masses with the superiority of the socialist animal husbandry economy. Among them, the Hutubi Ranch and the Urumqi Ranch mainly raise dairy cows and sheep to supply the people of all ethnic groups in Urumqi and nearby industrial and mining areas with the meat and dairy products they need in large quantities.

Before the establishment of these state-owned ranches, surveys and preliminary planning were carried out, including agricultural production planning, to ensure the supply of feed for the livestock. Each ranch owns a large number of improved breeds of livestock. In addition to selecting and purchasing hundreds of improved dairy cows from the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, the Hutubi Ranch also imported ten excellent Alatau dairy cows from the Soviet Union. The basic construction of each ranch has already begun, and some cattle sheds, stables and other buildings have been completed.

　　新疆今年建成四个国营牧场
    新疆维吾尔自治区今年建成了四个新的地方国营牧场。就是呼图壁牧场和乌鲁木齐、哈密、阿克苏三个专区牧场。这些牧场都是经济牧场，经营一般牲畜，为国家增产畜产品，同时以社会主义畜牧业经济的优越性教育群众。其中呼图壁牧场和乌鲁木齐牧场主要饲养乳牛和绵羊，供应乌鲁木齐市和附近工矿区各族人民大量需要的肉食和乳类。
    这些国营牧场建立前都进行了勘查和初步规划，其中包括农产的规划，以保证牲畜的饲料供应。各场都拥有大批良种牲畜。呼图壁牧场除向伊犁哈萨克自治州选购了数百头良种乳牛外，还从苏联进口了十头优良的阿拉托夫种乳牛。各场的基本建设已经开始，有的牛舍、马厩等建筑已经建成。
