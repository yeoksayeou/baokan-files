Agricultural Cooperatives Should Take the Lead in Repaying Overdue State Loans
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Yuan Liang
When Xin Jin County in Liaoning Province recently recovered overdue agricultural loans, it discovered a very bad phenomenon: many agricultural cooperatives were simply not prepared to repay, or only repay a portion, or only repay the interest. The Xin Jin branch of the People's Bank of China conducted a survey of sixty-three cooperatives in eight districts: they should have repaid a total of 58,296 yuan in various agricultural loans, and they had the ability to repay 44,685 yuan, but when they calculated the distribution, they only planned to repay 23,422 yuan. Of these sixty-three cooperatives, less than 10 percent were prepared to repay in full or make every effort to repay the loans, while more than 70 percent, although having the ability to repay, were only prepared to repay a portion. The No. 2 Cooperation of Yuyiao Village, Shahe District, should have repaid and was able to repay 400 yuan in loans, but only intended to repay 50 yuan; the Hongsheng No. 1 Cooperative of Guomuyuan Village, Zanzi River District, borrowed 1,800 yuan which was overdue, and the cooperative had the ability to repay 1,400 yuan, but only prepared to repay 400 yuan; the Xinbao No. 1 Cooperative of Yichengbao Village had overdue loans of 574 yuan, and had the ability to repay them all, but was not prepared to repay any of it.
　　One of the important reasons why these cooperatives were not actively repaying overdue agricultural loans was fear that deducting the loans would reduce the income of the members, and the superiority of the cooperatives could not be fully demonstrated. Some cooperatives also planned to repay the loans of credit cooperatives first, and then repay the loans of the national bank, believing that it did not matter if they did not repay the loans of the national bank. There were also individual district and village (equivalent to townships in Guannei) cadres who had borrowed agricultural loans, and they were not prepared to repay them themselves, so they did not dare to actively carry out the work of recovering overdue national loans.
　　This situation shows that some cadres and peasants lack a correct understanding of the significance of the state issuing agricultural loans and recovering overdue loans. They do not yet realize that in planned economic construction, the state first concentrates a large amount of funds to develop heavy industry, and at the same time, it also allocates huge sums of money to support the development of agricultural production as much as possible. Although the state may appropriately increase some new agricultural investment every year, the solution to the loan problem mainly depends on the turnover of existing funds. If the loans issued by the state cannot be recovered as scheduled, the turnover of funds cannot be accelerated, which will prevent many agricultural production units, especially newly established cooperatives or mutual aid groups, from receiving loans in a timely manner. This is very detrimental to both the peasants and the state.
　　In order to do a good job in recovering overdue agricultural loans, the national bank should adhere to the principle of "collecting where there is ability, and not forcing where there is no ability." Party committees, governments, and banks at all levels should conduct in-depth and meticulous ideological education on those production units or individuals who have the ability but are unwilling or unprepared to repay overdue loans in full, so that they understand that without the interests of the state, the interests of the whole, there would be no agricultural production cooperatives and individual interests. The cadres and all members of the cooperative should clearly recognize that the development of cooperative production, the increase in the income of the members, and the realization of the superiority of the cooperative should be created by the hard work of all the members, and should not rely on the method of arrears of overdue loans from the national bank to "obtain". If the cooperative has encountered difficulties in management, it should also request assistance from the state with a correct attitude and in accordance with the government's regulations; it is wrong and unacceptable to only consider one's own narrow interests and take advantage of the state. Rural cadres should not only be exemplary in repaying national loans, but also actively persuade the masses and assist the national bank in recovering overdue loans in a timely manner.

    农业合作社要带头归还到期的国家贷款
    袁良
    辽宁省新金县最近收回到期的农业贷款的时候，发现了一种很不好的现象：有不少农业合作社根本不准备归还，或者只归还一部分，或者只归还利息。中国人民银行新金支行对八个区的六十三个合作社作了调查：它们应该归还的各项农业贷款共五万八千二百九十六元，它们有力量归还四万四千六百八十五元，但是它们在试算分配的时候，仅仅计划归还二万三千四百二十二元。这六十三个合作社中，只有不到百分之十的社准备全数归还或尽力归还贷款，百分之七十多的社虽有归还能力，但是只准备归还一部分。沙河区于窑村民华第二合作社应该归还也能够归还四百元贷款，但是只打算归还五十元；赞子河区果木园村红胜第一合作社借的一千八百元已经到期，社里有归还一千四百元的能力，却只准备归还四百元；驿城堡村新堡第一合作社到期贷款五百七十四元，有全部归还的能力，却一点也不准备归还。
    这些合作社不积极归还到期农业贷款的重要原因之一，是怕扣除贷款以后社员收益减少，不能充分显示合作社的优越性。还有一些合作社打算先还信用合作社的贷款，后还国家银行的贷款，认为不还国家银行的贷款没有关系。还有个别的借了农业贷款的区、村（相当于关内的乡）干部，自己不准备归还，便不敢积极进行回收国家到期贷款的工作。
    这种情况说明部分干部和农民对于国家发放农业贷款和收回到期贷款的意义缺乏正确的了解。他们还不认识：在有计划的经济建设中，国家一方面首先集中大量资金发展重工业，同时，还尽可能拨出巨款扶助农业生产的发展。虽然国家每年可能酌增部分新的农业投资，但是贷款问题的解决，主要还是依靠现有资金的周转。如果国家发放的贷款不能如期回笼，就不能加速资金的周转，就会使许多农业生产单位，首先是新建的合作社或互助组，不能及时得到贷款。这对农民和国家都是很不利的。
    为了作好回收到期农业贷款的工作，国家银行应该坚持“有力必收、无力不逼”的原则。各级党委、政府和银行在贷款回收工作中，对那些有力量而不愿意或不准备全数归还到期贷款的生产单位或个人，要进行深入、细致的思想教育，使他们懂得：没有国家的利益，整体的利益，便不会有农业生产合作社和个人的利益。应该使合作社的干部和全体社员明确地认识，合作社生产的发展，社员收入的增加，合作社优越性的发挥，应该依靠全体社员的辛勤劳动来创造，而不能依靠拖欠国家银行的到期贷款的办法来“取得”。如果合作社在经营方面发生了困难，也应该以正确的态度，按照政府的规定，要求国家给以帮助；只顾自己的狭小的利益、来占国家的便宜，这是错误的，不能容许的。农村干部不但应该在归还国家贷款方面为人模范，而且应该积极地说服群众，协助国家银行把到期贷款及时收回来。
