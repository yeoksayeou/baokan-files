    Transforming Wooden Sailboat Transportation Through Mutual Aid and Cooperation
    Wang Mingxian Yuan Xingnan
    China is a country with many rivers. On these rivers, in addition to many large ships, there are also many small wooden sailboats. According to incomplete statistics in 1954, there were approximately 294,000 wooden sailboats nationwide, with a carrying capacity of over 3.1 million tons, employing around 2.8 million people and their families. Currently, wooden sailboats still undertake a considerable amount of transportation tasks in China and are a strong assistant to the state-owned transportation industry. In 1954, the volume of freight transported by these wooden sailboats accounted for 85% of the total local inland waterway transportation in the country, and the freight turnover accounted for about 70%. Currently, the country is concentrating its main efforts on developing heavy industry, and in the short term, it will not be able to improve China's numerous natural inland waterways, nor will it be possible to spend a lot of money to add more modern transportation tools for local areas. Therefore, for a considerable period to come, wooden sailboat transportation will continue to play an important role in developing agricultural production and enlivening primary markets.
    In this vast transportation force, apart from about 2% of the total number of people who live on or mainly rely on exploitative income as boat owners, the vast majority are individual labor boat people. Individual wooden sailboats, similar to the small-scale peasant economy, have insurmountable weaknesses such as being scattered, backward, and having rudimentary tools and equipment, and cannot resist natural disasters. For example, in April and May this year, there was a drought and little rain in South China, the water was shallow and the rivers dried up, and some wooden sailboats were stranded and unable to operate. During the flood season or in strong winds and waves, wooden sailboats also had to stop sailing. Therefore, the lives of boat people are unstable. At the same time, wooden sailboats are operated by manpower and are technologically backward, so the speed is low, the quality of transportation is poor, the safety of passengers and goods is difficult to guarantee, and the reduction of shipping costs is greatly limited, which makes it impossible to adapt to the increasingly developed industrial and agricultural economy. Individual boat people are also constantly polarizing. Some boat people go bankrupt because they cannot resist natural disasters; some boat people blindly build boats, expand tonnage, speculate, compete for routes, grab cargo, and hire workers to exploit others. The seasonality of cargo sources and the imbalance between upstream and downstream directly affect the efficiency of ship use and the improvement of boat people's lives. In the off-season, it is difficult for boat people to maintain their lives. Therefore, it is very important to carry out the socialist transformation of boat people.
    The state's policy for the individual wooden sailboat transportation industry is: under the leadership of the CPC committees at all levels and governments at all levels, and under the specific guidance of local transportation administrative management agencies, according to the principle of voluntariness, through various different forms, individual boat people should be gradually organized through the path of mutual aid and cooperation to serve the needs of the country and society. Then, lead them to gradually transition to socialist transportation cooperatives, changing individual ownership into collective ownership.
    Labor boat people are similar to farmers in rural areas and handicraftsmen in towns, they are both laborers and small private owners. Because they are laborers, it is determined that they can gradually move towards socialism under the leadership of the working class through the path of mutual aid and cooperation. As for the very few capitalist wooden sailboats, they can be transformed by adopting various forms of state capitalism or other forms.
    In the past few years, various localities have done some work on the socialist transformation of the individual wooden sailboat transportation industry and have gained some experience. At present, the forms adopted in various localities are roughly as follows:
    First, private wooden sailboats are compiled into temporary or fixed groups and teams to implement unified allocation of loads, unified dispatch, and unified freight rates. Sichuan Province has already compiled 277 teams and 2,962 groups, accounting for about 94% of the total number of ships in the province. Some areas, according to transportation needs, set routes according to waterways, and organize small and medium-sized ships to the upper reaches of small rivers for segmented transportation, so as to concentrate cargo sources for large ships or railways and highways in the lower reaches. The Pearl River Shipping Bureau tried this method in the East River, overcoming the shortcomings of cargo backlog in the tributaries and lack of cargo for large ships in the main stream, the ship turnover rate increased by two times, increased the income of the boat people, and reduced accidents. After organizing wooden sailboats through grouping and segmented transportation, they are initially brought into the orbit of national planned transportation, providing conditions for improving production efficiency, improving the lives of boat people, cultivating the habit of collective labor for boat people, and developing mutual aid and cooperation.
    Second, organize state-owned ships to tow private wooden sailboats for cooperative transportation. There are three forms: one is long-term monthly rental, organized by state-owned ship transportation enterprises, and rent is paid. One is that the ship transportation enterprise controls the use within a specified time and divides the freight according to the voyage. Another is that during the peak transportation season and when there are urgent transportation tasks, they are temporarily combined by voyage, and the freight is divided. According to statistics from nine provinces including Jiangxi, Hubei, Jiangsu, and Anhui, the wooden sailboats combined with state-owned tugboats have a carrying capacity of approximately 210,000 tons. Last year, the volume of freight transported by these ships accounted for 46% of the total transportation volume of ships, and the freight turnover was 36.6%. The advantage of doing so is that it not only exerts the effectiveness of state-owned tug and barge ships, overcomes the difficulty of insufficient barges, but also brings private wooden sailboats into the orbit of national planning, which has played a positive role in completing transportation tasks. However, this form of combination is only a low-level form of transformation, and it does not change the relations of production.
    Third, transportation mutual aid groups are organized, which implement labor, technology, and economic mutual assistance to varying degrees. Six hundred and ninety-two such mutual aid groups have now been piloted in Jiangxi, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Hebei, Sichuan and other provinces.
    Fourth, transportation cooperatives are organized to implement unified management, ships are discounted into shares, labor is rated and points are determined, dividends are distributed according to shares, remuneration is paid according to labor, and public property is accumulated. Thirty have now been piloted in Guangdong, Jiangxi, Hunan, Anhui, Jiangsu, Sichuan, Hubei, Shandong, Gansu and other provinces. Some of them implement unified operation and management, unified maintenance, and the original ship employment relationship remains unchanged, and wages and food are borne by the original ship; some of them use ships as shares at a price, dividends are distributed according to shares, unified operation, labor is rated and points are determined, and remuneration is paid according to labor; some of them are that boat people invest in shares at a discounted price of ships, and boat workers invest in shares with money or labor, and dividends are distributed according to shares, unified operation, and they have equal status in economy, changing the employment relationship into a cooperative relationship.
    The above various types of mutual aid and cooperation have great advantages over individual ships. This is manifested in:
    1.  The establishment of a responsibility system and production management systems such as pre-sailing and post-sailing meetings, work has a clear division of labor, and special personnel are responsible for receiving and delivering goods, loading and unloading, handling navigation procedures, and purchasing and storage, which overcomes the weaknesses of past decentralized operations and greatly improves production. For example, after the establishment of the Luohe Wooden Sailboat Transportation Cooperative in Henan Province, the enthusiasm of the members was high, and they put forward slogans such as "Catch the moon in the first half of the month, get up at five shifts in the second half of the month," "Don't wait for the wind, don't let the wind, delay during the day, catch up at dusk," etc., and the transportation efficiency has been significantly improved. In Jiangxi Province, the voyage from Nanchang to Ji'an takes 24 days for a single boat to make a round trip in the dry season, while a cooperative's boat takes 20 days, and some even take only 17 days. In the first quarter of this year, with the labor productivity of each laborer on a single boat averaging 100, the mutual aid group was 114, and the cooperative was 137.
    2.  Improved transportation quality and guaranteed safe navigation. From October last year to March this year, the first wooden sailboat transportation cooperative in Shaoyang, Hunan, never had any marine damage accidents. In the safety transportation labor competition, it won the mobile red flag for consecutive times and was rated as a first-class collective model in Shaoyang City, becoming a banner in safe production.
    3.  Unified management reduces or overcomes the difficulty of ship repair. With public accumulation funds, boat people can concentrate financial resources to maintain and maintain ships in a planned way. At the same time, unified procurement of materials can not only supply in time but also save costs. The ship repair costs of the Wujiang Wooden Sailboat Transportation Cooperative in Jiangsu Province are about 10% lower than before the establishment of the cooperative. Not long after the establishment of the Tianjin Forward Wooden Sailboat Transportation Cooperative, the shipping cost was reduced by 20% compared with the time when it was done independently.
    4.  Increased the income of members and improved the lives of boat people. The Nanchang Wooden Sailboat Transportation Cooperative in Jiangxi turned around the loss situation in the second half of last year and had a surplus. In the first quarter of this year, the average income of members increased by 12% compared with when they were working independently. The whole society also accumulated public accumulation funds of about 4,000 yuan, and the ships of the nine groups added new oars. After the establishment of the Yongxing Wooden Sailboat Transportation Cooperative in Hunan, the monthly income of members was 36% higher than that of boat workers outside the community.
    5.  The members have initially established the concept of planning and clarified that wooden sailboats should serve the country's planned transportation, and generally can complete tasks in accordance with the annual, quarterly, and monthly plans, overcoming the blindness and spontaneity of the past.
    6.  Improved the socialist awareness and production enthusiasm of boat workers and labor boat people, strengthened unity, initially established a collective concept, technical experience began to be exchanged, and changed the old habit of "keeping a secret from others."
    In order to do a good job in the socialist transformation of the wooden sailboat transportation industry, we must first correct some erroneous understandings of certain leading staff members. For example, some people think that wooden sailboats are backward transportation tools and have no great future, or they are afraid that organizing wooden sailboats will conflict with the development of ship transportation; therefore, they hold the wrong attitude of "dragging it down" or "getting rid of it." Some people are too hasty, regardless of the level of awareness of the masses, prematurely and unrealistically pursuing advanced forms, or adopting mandatory orders. These are all wrong, and if they are not corrected, they will affect the smooth progress of the transformation of the individual wooden boat industry.
    The transformation of the wooden sailboat transportation industry is a long-term and complex struggle process. Some boat people reflect that they are afraid of not being free after joining the community, afraid of reduced income, and afraid that everything will be turned over to the public. These concerns can only be dispelled through meticulous publicity and education work, so that boat people can voluntarily participate in the cooperative. At the same time, we must also estimate that the situation on the water is complex, and in the wooden sailboat transportation industry, there may be a few hidden counter-revolutionaries who will take the opportunity to obstruct and sabotage, and they must be severely suppressed. The relevant departments should also strengthen the organization and management of wooden sailboats, and under the principle of overall planning and comprehensive arrangements, gradually and steadily guide them to embark on the path of mutual aid and cooperation through various forms of mutual aid and cooperation.

    通过互助合作的道路改造木帆船运输业
    王明贤　袁星南
    我国是一个多河流的国家。在这些河流上，除了许多大型的轮船外，还行驶着许多小型的木帆船。根据一九五四年的不完全统计，全国的木帆船约有二十九万四千多艘，载重三百一十余万吨，从业人员和他们的家属约二百八十万人。目前在我国，木帆船还担负相当大的运输任务，是国营交通运输业的有力助手。一九五四年，这些木帆船所完成的货运量，占全国地方内河航运总量的百分之八十五，货物周转量占百分之七十左右。目前国家正集中主要力量来发展重工业，短期内还不能对我国众多的内河自然航道加以改善，也不可能拿很多钱来给地方添置更多的现代运输工具。因此，在今后一个相当长的时期内，木帆船运输对发展农业生产和活跃初级市场将继续发挥重要的作用。
    在这支庞大的运输队伍中，除了约占总人数百分之二左右的依靠剥削收入为生或主要依靠剥削收入为生的船主外，绝大多数都是个体劳动船民。个体木帆船跟小农经济相似，具有分散、落后、工具和设备简陋等不可克服的弱点，不能抗拒自然灾害。例如今年四、五月间，华南地区天旱少雨，水浅河干，部分木帆船就搁浅，不能营运。在洪水期或大风大浪时，木帆船也要停航。因此船民生活是不稳定的。同时，木帆船是由人力操作，技术落后，因而，航速低、运输质量差、客货安全很难得到保障，降低航运成本也受到很大限制，这就使它不能跟工农业经济日益发展的情况相适应。个体船民还时刻向两极分化着。有的船民因无力抵抗自然灾害而破产；有的船民则盲目造船，扩大吨位，投机取巧，争航线，抢货源，雇工，来剥削别人。货源的季节性，上下水的不平衡性，也直接影响到船舶的使用效率和船民生活的改善。在淡季，船民的生活就难以维持。因此，对船民进行社会主义改造是十分重要的。
    国家对个体木帆船运输业的方针是：在中共各级党委和各级政府的领导和全面规划下，在地方交通行政管理机关的具体指导下，根据自愿原则，通过各种不同的形式，使个体船民经过互助合作的道路，逐步组织起来，为国家和社会的需要服务。然后，领导他们逐步过渡到社会主义性质的运输合作社，把个人所有制变为集体所有制。
    劳动船民跟农村中的农民，集镇中的手工业者类似，既是劳动者，又是小私有者。由于他们是劳动者，就决定了他们可以在工人阶级领导下，通过互助合作的道路，逐步地走到社会主义去。至于为数极少的资本主义性质的木帆船，可以采用各种不同形式的国家资本主义或其它形式加以改造。
    过去几年，各地对个体木帆船运输业的社会主义改造曾做了一些工作，并且取得了一些经验。目前各地所采取的形式大体有如下几种：
    第一、把私营木帆船编成临时的或固定的组和队，实行统一配儎、统一调度、统一运价。四川省已经编了二七七队，二、九六二组，约占全省船只总数的百分之九十四。有的地区根据运输需要，按河道定航线，有组织地把中小船导向上游小河进行分段运输，为下游大船或铁路、公路集中货源。珠江航运局在东江试行这个办法，克服了支流货物积压、干流大船缺货的缺点，船舶周转率提高了两倍，增加了船民收入，减少了事故。经过编组编队和分段运输等方法把木帆船组织起来以后，就初步把它们纳入国家计划运输的轨道，为提高生产效率、改善船民生活、培养船民集体劳动的习惯、开展互助合作提供了条件。
    第二、组织国营轮船拖带私营木帆船合作运输。形式有三种：一种是长期按月租用，由国营轮船运输企业组织，付给租金。一种是在规定时间内由轮船运输企业掌握使用，按航次分折运费。还有一种是在运输旺季和有紧急运输任务的时候，临时按航次结合，运费分折。根据江西、湖北、江苏、安徽等九省的统计，和国营拖轮结合的木帆船，约计有二十一万多吨的载重量。去年这些船只所完成的货物运输量占轮船总运输量的百分之四十六，货物周转量为百分之三十六点六。这样做的好处是：不仅发挥了国营拖驳轮船的效能，克服了驳船不足的困难，而且把私营木帆船纳入了国家计划轨道，对完成运输任务起了积极作用。但这种结合形式也只是一种低级的改造形式，它没有改变生产关系。
    第三、在不同程度上实行劳动、技术、经济等互助的运输互助组。这种互助组现在在江西、安徽、湖南、湖北、河北、四川等省已经重点试办了六百九十二个。
    第四、组织运输合作社，统一经营，船舶折价入股，劳动力评级定分，按股分红，按劳付酬，并积累公共财产。现在广东、江西、湖南、安徽、江苏、四川、湖北、山东、甘肃等省已经试办了三十个。有的是统一经营管理，统一维修，原船雇佣关系不变，工资、伙食均由原船负责；有的是以船作价入股，按股分红，统一经营，劳动力评级定分，按劳付酬；有的是船民以船舶折价入股，船工以钱或劳力入股，都按股分红，统一经营，在经济上彼此有同等地位，变雇佣关系为合作关系。
    上述各种类型的互助合作，比个体船舶都有很大的优越性。这表现在：
    一、建立了责任制和航前航后会议等生产管理制度，工作有了明确分工，接货交货、装卸、办理航行手续、采购保管等工作都有专人负责，克服了过去分散经营的弱点，使生产大大提高。例如河南省漯河木帆船运输业合作社成立后，社员们情绪高涨，提出了“前半月赶月亮，后半月起五更”，“顶风不等，顺风不让，白天耽误，黄昏赶上”等口号，运输效率有显著的提高。江西省由南昌至吉安的航程，在枯水季节往返一次，单干船只需要二十四天，而合作社的船只要二十天，有的只要十七天。今年第一季，以单干船只平均每个劳动力的劳动生产率为一百，互助组的则为一一四，合作社的则为一三七。
    二、提高了运输质量，保证了航行安全。湖南邵阳第一木帆船运输业合作社，从去年十月至今年三月，从未发生过海损事故，在安全运输劳动竞赛中，连续获得了流动红旗，并被评为邵阳市甲等集体模范，成为安全生产中的一面旗帜。
    三、统一经营，减少或克服了修船的困难。有了公积金，船民就能够集中财力，有计划地对船只进行维修保养。同时，统一购料，既可以及时供应，又节省费用。江苏省吴江木帆船运输业合作社的船只修理费，比成立合作社以前节省了百分之十左右。天津前进木帆船运输业合作社成立不久，航运成本即较单干时降低了百分之二十。
    四、增加了社员的收入，改善了船民生活。江西南昌木帆船运输业合作社在去年下半年扭转了亏损的局面，还有盈余。今年第一季度，社员收入平均较单干时提高了百分之十二。全社还积累了公积金四千元左右，九个组的船都添了新划子。湖南永兴木帆船运输业合作社成立后，社员每月的收入较社外船工多百分之三十六。
    五、社员们初步树立了计划观念，明确了木帆船要为国家的计划运输服务，一般地都能按照年、季、月度计划完成任务，克服了过去的盲目性和自发性。
    六、提高了船工和劳动船民的社会主义觉悟程度和生产积极性，加强了团结，初步树立了集体观念，技术经验开始有了交流，改变了“多留一手不传人”的旧风气。
    为了作好木帆船运输业的社会主义改造工作，必须首先纠正某些领导工作人员的若干错误认识。例如有的人以为木帆船是落后的运输工具，没有多大前途，或者是怕把木帆船组织起来后和轮船运输的发展有矛盾；因而对这件工作抱着“拖垮”或“推出去了事”的错误态度。有的人操之过急，不顾群众觉悟程度，过早地不切合实际地追求高级形式，或采用强迫命令的办法。这些都是不对的，如果不纠正，就会影响到对个体木船业改造工作的顺利进行。
    对木帆船运输业的改造，是一个长期的复杂的斗争过程。有些船民反映怕入社后不自由，怕收入减少，怕一切归公。这些顾虑，要经过细致的宣传教育工作，才能解除，才能使船民自愿地参加到合作社中来。同时，我们也还要估计到水上情况复杂，在木帆船运输业中，可能有少数暗藏的反革命分子会乘隙进行阻挠和破坏，必须给予严厉镇压。各有关的部门还应加强对木帆船的组织管理，在统筹兼顾、全面安排的方针下，通过多种的互助合作形式逐步地稳妥地引导他们走上互助合作的道路。
