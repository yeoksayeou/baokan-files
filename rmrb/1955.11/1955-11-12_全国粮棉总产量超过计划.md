　　National Grain and Cotton Output Exceeds Planned Targets
　　(Our Newspaper) News - This year, the nation has achieved a bumper harvest of grain and cotton, with total output exceeding the original national plan. According to preliminary estimates from the Ministry of Agriculture, the total national grain output reached over 360 billion catties, an increase of over 20 billion catties compared to 1954. Among these, rice production increased by over 10 billion catties compared to 1954. The total national cotton output reached over 27 million dan (raw cotton, same below), an increase of around 6 million dan compared to 1954, and an increase of over 1 million dan compared to the bumper harvest year of 1952.
　　The main reasons for this year's bumper harvest of grain and cotton are the relatively few natural disasters and the implementation of the "Three Fixes" policy for grain and the development of the agricultural cooperativization movement, which greatly increased farmers' enthusiasm for production. This year, under the guidance of agricultural production cooperatives, farmers in various regions exceeded the original plan for cotton planting areas and extensively carried out technical instruction on close planting, seed selection, fertilization, and pruning. According to incomplete statistics from eight provinces, including Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Shaanxi, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, and Anhui, over 710,000 farmers received cotton planting technical instruction, which powerfully promoted this year's technical reform movement in cotton planting and expanded the planting area of improved cotton varieties. This year, the national area of improved cotton varieties increased by 9 million mu compared to 1954. Among these, the conversion of 4 million mu of cotton fields from coarse cotton to fine cotton in provinces such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan alone can increase raw cotton production by 200,000 dan. In Hebei Province, cotton farmers, under the active leadership of agricultural production cooperatives, overcame various natural disasters and universally implemented techniques such as close planting and timely topdressing, achieving a bumper harvest. The province's total cotton output exceeded the original plan by over 200,000 dan, and the yield per unit area also increased by about 9% compared to 1954.
　　The increase in production this year is particularly significant in the provinces of Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangsu, which suffered from major floods in 1954. Although these provinces suffered from floods in 1954, Party and government leadership departments at all levels adopted a series of measures to quickly help disaster areas restore production; and under the leadership of agricultural production cooperatives, farmers actively built water conservancy projects and changed cultivation systems. This year, the national planting area that changed from single-season to double-season, intercropping to continuous cropping, and indica rice to japonica rice increased by over 8 million mu compared to 1954. In Jiangxi Province, due to the implementation of the "Three Changes" (changing single-season rice to double-season rice, changing dry land to paddy fields, and changing mid-season rice to early-season rice) and eight agricultural production increase technologies such as selecting improved varieties and appropriate close planting, early and mid-season rice in the province generally increased by 4% to 8%, and many agricultural production cooperatives increased by 10% to 20% or more. This year, the area of double-season rice in Hunan Province has expanded to over 5.4 million mu, an increase of 40% compared to 1954. Therefore, the total rice output in the province increased by 5% compared to the bumper harvest year of 1953. This year, the total grain output in Hubei Province also exceeded the plan by about 5%, an increase of 1 billion catties compared to 1953 before the flood.
　　This year, various regions also actively expanded the area of high-yield crops. This year, the national area planted with corn and potatoes increased by over 20 million mu compared to 1954. Potatoes alone were planted on over 150 million mu this year, with a total output of over 38.6 billion catties. The corn planting area in Shandong Province also increased by over 3.9 million mu compared to 1954. The yield per mu is on average 15 to 83 catties higher than local sorghum and soybeans.

### 全国粮棉总产量超过计划

　　全国粮棉总产量超过计划
    本报讯　今年全国粮食和棉花获得丰收，总产量超过国家原订计划。根据农业部初步预计，全国粮食总产量达到三千六百多亿斤，比一九五四年增产二百多亿斤。其中稻谷比一九五四年增产一百多亿斤。全国棉花总产量达到二千七百多万担（皮棉，下同），比一九五四年增产六百万担左右，比大丰收的一九五二年增产一百多万担。
    今年全国粮食和棉花所以获得大丰收，除自然灾害较少外，主要原因是贯彻执行了粮食“三定”政策和农业合作化运动的发展，大大提高了农民生产积极性。今年各地农民在农业生产合作社的带动下，棉花播种面积超过了原计划，并广泛开展了密植、选种、施肥、整枝等技术传授工作。根据河北、山东、河南、陕西、湖北、湖南、四川、安徽等八省的不完全统计，受到植棉技术传授的农民有七十一万多人，有力地推动了今年植棉技术改革运动，扩大了优良棉种播种面积。今年全国良种棉田比一九五四年扩大了九百万亩。其中仅江苏、浙江、安徽、江西、湖北、湖南等省的四百万亩棉田将粗绒棉改种细绒棉，即可增产皮棉二十万担。河北省植棉农民在农业生产合作社的积极带动下，战胜了各种自然灾害，普遍实行密植、及时追肥等技术，获得了大丰收。全省棉花总产量超过原订计划二十多万担，而且单位面积产量也比一九五四年增加百分之九左右。
    今年增产比较显著的，是一九五四年遭受大水的安徽、湖北、湖南、江苏等省。这些省份一九五四年虽然遭受水灾，但是各级党、政领导部门采取了一系列的措施，迅速帮助灾区恢复了生产；并在农业生产合作社的带动下，农民积极兴修水利，改变耕作制度。全国今年单季变双季、间作改连作、籼稻改粳稻的种植面积，比一九五四年扩大八百多万亩。江西省由于推行了变单季稻为双季稻、变旱地为水田、变中稻为早稻的三变和选用良种、适当密植等八项农业增产技术，全省早、中稻普遍增产百分之四到八，许多农业生产合作社增产了百分之十到二十以上。湖南省今年双季稻的面积已扩大到五百四十多万亩，比一九五四年增加百分之四十。因此全省稻谷总产量比丰收的一九五三年增加百分之五。湖北省今年粮食总产量也超过计划百分之五左右，比大水前的一九五三年增产十亿斤。
    今年各地还积极扩大了高产作物面积，全国今年种植玉米、薯类的面积比一九五四年增加二千多万亩，仅薯类今年就播种了一亿五千多万亩，总产量达到三百八十六亿多斤。山东省玉米播种面积也比一九五四年扩大了三百九十多万亩。每亩产量比当地高粱、大豆等平均可多收十五斤到八十三斤。
