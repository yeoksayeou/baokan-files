    Wuan Three Hundred Heroes Gather
    Exchange production experience, strengthen combat readiness.
    [This newspaper] The Wuan County Labor Hero Conference opened on November 1st. The three hundred and twenty-six heroes, supported by the 330,000 people of the county, joyfully walked towards the meeting place amidst the sound of three salutes. At the beginning of the conference, County Chief Cheng Wu first gave a report. He first pointed out that the heroes led the masses to turn themselves around, kill enemies, produce... and made many achievements. This is a great event since the beginning of the world, more great and glorious than those ancient individual heroes. This is the true people's hero who seeks benefits for the masses. Finally, County Chief Cheng said: "Our meeting is being held at a time when Chiang Kai-shek is attacking us. If the meeting is successful, we will go back and step up war preparations and repel Chiang Kai-shek's attack." Then, seven heroes, including labor heroes, liberation heroes, enemy-killing heroes, and textile heroes, spoke one after another. Labor hero Li Du and textile hero Guo Heng both expressed that they would lead the masses to resolutely repel the Chiang army's attack. More than 300 heroes unanimously decided on the spot to send a telegram to the United Nations General Assembly, requesting the US military to withdraw from China. In the evening, the United Troupe performed "Blood and Tears of Hatred" to comfort the heroes. On the second day of the conference, there were group discussions.
    On the third day, the plenary session began. Chairman Cao Youmin reported the great victory on the Jiji-Yu front. Amidst the cheers and applause of the audience, a congratulatory telegram to General Liu Bocheng and the soldiers on the front line was passed. Then the heroes spoke one after another, reporting their experiences. Among them, Ji Yuqiu's seed selection method, Yang Zhancheng's transformation of lazy people, Zhao Zailun's use of clapper tales to break down enemy rumors, Shen Yulin's cooperative work, and Hao Heting's organization of village-wide production were the most exciting. Hao Heting organized village-wide production this year and gained profits, opened a small textile factory, purchased textile tools, and set up a dyehouse. In addition, he also led the weeding and branching of cotton, making the village produce more than 120 jin of cotton per mu, reaching the highest cotton production record in the county.
    The conference continued to exchange experiences, elect summaries, and award prizes, and closed victoriously on the morning of the 9th. Dozens of new heroes emerged during the conference. Li Sanni of Hejia Village was the most outstanding. He said: "Before the Eighth Route Army came, most of our village were poor households. Now they have all become middle peasants. From last year to this year, our village has added thirteen donkeys, two mules, eleven cattle, three hundred and twenty-two sheep, fifty-one pigs, more than a thousand chickens, built eleven new houses, and opened a dyehouse and a large cooperative. During Qingming, we planted 3,100 fruit trees and grafted 2,000 jujube trees." When Li Sanni and 74 other heroes were elected to step onto the stage to wear flowers, the audience applauded warmly for 30 minutes. County Party Secretary Cao Youmin pointed out in his summary: In this year's expansion of production, we harvested 6 million shi of grain and 69.45 million jin of cotton. At the same time, 3,910 heads of livestock were added, and the textile industry earned 31.8 million yuan. In the liberated areas, 85 villages have achieved leveling and replenishment in the struggle for emancipation, 80 villages have overthrown the landlords and are leveling, and 78 villages are in the midst of struggle; 250,000 mu of land and 1,281 heads of livestock have been returned to the peasants, and 41,870 houses and 2.24 million shi of grain have been returned to the peasants. In the war of resistance against Chiang Kai-shek and self-defense, there were touching stories of 60 fathers and mothers sending their sons to join the army and 40 wives sending their husbands to join the army, and the revolutionary family of Yi Fuyuan emerged. In order to defend the good times, he sold the mule he had obtained from the struggle and bought two guns and a thousand rounds of ammunition to prepare to fight the invading Chiang army. Finally, under the call of Comrade Wang Tingdong of the County Party Committee, four anti-Chiang measures were unanimously adopted: 1. Step up militia training. If the Chiang army dares to invade, every militiaman must strive to kill the enemy and seize the enemy's weapons... Carry out a thousand and ten thousand victories. 2. Thoroughly transfer materials and achieve village-to-village joint defense. 3. Do not let the enemy capture a single young man. 4. Not only must we struggle against the big Chiang in the open, but also against the hidden small Chiangs. After the awards were given, the heroes raised the glorious banner, carried the weapons of self-defense, and held the tools of production, taking pictures in front of the meeting place. At the same time, they sang an angry song: "Chiang Kai-shek, you bad thing..." Thousands of people came to see them off, and the conference closed in enthusiastic and joyous slogans.
