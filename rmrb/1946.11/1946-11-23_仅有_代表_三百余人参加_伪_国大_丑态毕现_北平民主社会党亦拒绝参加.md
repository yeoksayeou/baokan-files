Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th -- The "National Assembly" rigged up single-handedly by Chiang Kai-shek formally opened in Nanjing on the 15th. At the "preparatory meeting" held on the 18th and 19th, fierce struggles broke out among the various factions of the Kuomintang when discussing the so-called "election" of the presidium, revealing its ugliness. According to a United Press Nanjing dispatch of the 19th, the "election method" for the "National Assembly" presidium "was passed only after seven hours of stormy debate. During the debate, representatives shouted hoarsely, scrambling to use the broadcasting equipment to speak. Interim Chairman Sun Ke desperately tried to maintain order, and finally hastily allowed the chaotic meeting to proceed to a vote. At one point, representatives stood in front of the microphones, impatiently waiting their turn to speak. Only 356 people attended today (19th) (approximately one-sixth of the quota of "National Assembly" representatives), while a Central News Agency dispatch on the same day falsely reported the attendance as 1,380 people." According to United Press, "the Youth Party was again absent" from the meeting on the 19th. According to news from Peiping, members of the Peiping Democratic Socialist Party refused to participate in the National Assembly and warned that the party would split if comrades in Nanjing participated. The Democratic League declared that its position remained unchanged, that is, it would not participate in the National Assembly until the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference were implemented.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th -- Zhu Xuefan, Chairman of the China Labor Association, was recently invited to Paris to attend the executive committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions. He arrived in Hong Kong on the 15th and issued a statement in Hong Kong opposing the "National Assembly" monopolized by the Kuomintang. According to a United Press Hong Kong dispatch of the 19th, Zhu repeatedly denounced the Kuomintang's attempt to force the Labor Association to take an anti-communist stance and to force Zhu to participate in the National Assembly. Zhu stated that the purpose of this trip was to go to Paris to accuse the Kuomintang to the executive committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions.

　　仅有“代表”三百余人参加
    伪“国大”丑态毕现
    北平民主社会党亦拒绝参加
    【新华社延安二十日电】蒋介石一手包办的“国大”至十五日在南京正式开幕后，十八日及十九日举行“预备会”，在讨论所谓“选举”主席团问题时，国民党各小派系之间展开激烈斗争，丑态毕现。据合众社南京十九日电，“国大”主席团“选举办法”，“经七小时的风暴式的辩论后始予通过。辩论时各代表嘶声叫喊，抢着使用发言的播音器，临时主席孙科死命的力图维持秩序，最后才赶紧让乱成一片的会议进行表决。会上曾有一个时候各代表在播音器前站着，并且很不耐烦地等候轮流发言。今（十九）日出席者仅三百五十六人（按仅等于“国大”代表额定人数的六分之一），同日中央社的电讯则谎报出席人数为一千三百八十人。”据合众社称，十九日开会时“青年党又缺席”。据北平来讯，北平民主社会党人拒绝参加国大，而且警告称：如果南京的同志参加，则该党将分裂。民主同盟宣布立场不变，即在政协决议付诸实施以前不参加国大。
    【新华社延安二十日电】中国劳动协会理事长朱学范氏日前应邀赴巴黎出席世界职工联盟执委会，十五日抵香港，在港发表谈话，反对国民党一党包办的“国民大会”。据合众社香港十九日电称：朱氏谈话中再三斥责国民党企图迫使劳协采取反共立场，及迫朱氏参加国大。朱氏称，此行系赴巴黎向世界职工联盟执委会控诉国民党。
