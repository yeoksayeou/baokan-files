Xinhua News Agency report:

　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, November 17th: A Xinhua News Agency reporter commented that the so-called "National Assembly" convened by Chiang Kai-shek has only aroused feelings of aversion among broad social strata in China. The democratic parties refused to participate in the so-called "National Assembly" on the grounds that this "National Assembly" is illegal and its purpose is to use so-called "public opinion" to establish long-term dictatorship and civil war. The vast majority of the representatives of the so-called "National Assembly" were produced ten years ago by the Kuomintang using methods of designation, selection, bribery, and fraud, and have no credibility among the people. At the Political Consultative Conference in January of this year, the CCP and the democratic parties made great concessions, and only allowed participation in the National Assembly under the following conditions: (1) Amend the draft constitution in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and pass the constitution as amended by the Political Consultative Conference at the National Assembly. (2) Fulfill Chiang Kai-shek's four promises, and reorganize the Kuomintang government into a democratic coalition government, and then the democratic coalition government will prepare and convene the National Assembly. (3) The CCP representatives and Democratic League representatives to the National Assembly must have a sufficient number to maintain veto power. Now, the condition of amending the draft constitution by the Political Consultative Conference has not yielded any results due to the Kuomintang's obstruction. Not only has the Kuomintang government not been reorganized, but it has also expanded its political reaction and civil war. The convening of the "National Assembly" was entirely monopolized by the Kuomintang, and the newly added seats were also designated by the Kuomintang alone. Even the date of the meeting was not agreed upon by the various parties. (Chiang Kai-shek announced in April that the new convening date should be decided by the comprehensive group of the Political Consultative Conference.) It is widely believed that Chiang Kai-shek's insistence on convening the "National Assembly" under such illegal circumstances is an attempt to usurp public opinion, pass his so-called "constitution" that is convenient for continuing his dictatorship, and give his long-term civil war a so-called "constitutional" basis. This situation makes it impossible for the CCP and the democratic parties to adopt the method of participating in the "National Assembly" and acting as an opposition faction in the meeting. Because participating in the "National Assembly" means fundamentally violating the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, acknowledging the illegal "National Assembly," and acknowledging the reactionary constitution passed by the Kuomintang using the name of the "National Assembly," thus plunging the Chinese people and their descendants under the dictatorial and tyrannical power of Chiang Kai-shek's fascism. Although parties such as the Youth Party participated, domestic and foreign public opinion still recognizes the so-called "National Assembly" as something monopolized by the Kuomintang, and portrays the Youth Party and others as appendages of the Kuomintang. All indications show that Chiang Kai-shek, in this political gamble, has already been in a state of failure because the CCP, the Democratic League, and other credible democrats have refused to participate in the "National Assembly." The so-called "National Assembly" and the so-called "constitution" passed by it will not be recognized as valid by the Chinese people. Authoritative observers explain that Chiang Kai-shek's adoption of this self-defeating strategy is because he has no political way out, just as his attack on Yan'an is due to the fact that he has no military way out. Chiang Kai-shek is increasingly moving into an irretrievable dead end, and the terrifying shadow of his final failure is increasingly approaching. Chiang Kai-shek's convening of the "National Assembly" and his attack on Yan'an are the beginning of his demise, just as Yuan Shikai's convening of the "Chouan Society" and his attack on the Yunnan National Protection Army were the beginning of his demise. No amount of imperialist help can save his fate. Chiang Kai-shek's convening of the "National Assembly" and his attack on Yan'an have finally and completely exposed the ferocious faces of Chiang Kai-shek and his supporter, American imperialism. Therefore, it has eliminated all illusions of the Chinese people about him. Therefore, it has greatly strengthened the Chinese people's iron-like determination to fight to the end with the American imperialist's running dog, Chiang Kai-shek!

　　新华社记者评非法国大
    蒋介石这次政治冒险已处失败地位开伪国大进攻延安是他灭亡的开始
    【新华社延安十七日电】新华社记者评论，蒋介石召集的所谓“国民大会”，在中国广泛的社会阶层中只引起厌恶的感觉。民主党派拒绝参加所谓“国大”所持理由，是这个“国大”是非法的，其目的在假借所谓“民意”确定长期的独裁与内战。所谓“国大”的绝大多数代表，均系十年前由国民党用指定、圈定、贿选、舞弊的方法产生，在人民中毫无信仰。今年一月政协会议上，中共与民主党派作了极大让步以后，才在如下的条件下允许参加国大，即：（一）按照政协决议修改宪草，并以此政协所修改之宪草在国大通过。（二）实现蒋介石的四项诺言，并改组国民党政府为民主联合政府，然后由民主联合政府筹备与召集国大。（三）国大的中共代表与民主同盟代表须有足够数量，以保持否决权。现在政协修改宪草条件，因国民党阻挠未获任何结果。国民党政府不但决未改组，且已扩大其政治反动与内战。“国大”的召集，完全由国民党一党所包办，其新增加的名额，亦由国民党一党指定。甚至会期亦未经各党派协议。（而蒋介石在四月间曾宣布过，新的召集期应由政协综合小组商定。）众信蒋介石坚持在此种非法情况下召开“国大”，乃是企图篡窃民意，通过他便于继续独裁的所谓“宪法”，并使他的长期内战得到所谓“宪法”的根据。这种情形，使中共与民主党派不可能采取参加“国大”而在会议中作反对派的方法。因参加“国大”，即表示根本违反政治协商会议决议，承认非法的“国大”，承认国民党利用“国大”名义所通过的反动宪法，因而使中国人民子子孙孙陷于蒋介石法西斯的独裁淫威之下。虽然有青年党等参加，但中外舆论仍认所谓“国大”为国民党一党包办的东西，并描写青年党等为国民党的附属物。各种征象都说明，蒋介石在这次政治冒险中，已因中共、民盟与其他有威信的民主人士拒绝参加“国大”而处于失败的地位。所谓“国大”及其通过的所谓“宪法”，都不会被中国人民所承认为有效。权威的观察家解释，蒋介石出此自取失败的下策，乃是他在政治上没有出路，如同他的进攻延安是由于他在军事上没有出路一样。蒋介石已日益走入无法挽救的穷途，他的最后失败的可怕巨影已经日益迫近。蒋介石的召开“国大”和进攻延安，乃是他的灭亡的开始，正如召集“筹安会”与进攻云南护国军是袁世凯灭亡的开始一样。任何帝国主义的帮助，都不能挽救其命运。蒋介石的召集“国大”与进攻延安，把蒋介石及其拥护者美国帝国主义的凶残面貌最后地完全的暴露出来。因此，就消除了中国人民对他的一切幻想。因此，就大大的加强了中国人民与美国帝国主义的走狗蒋介石战斗到底的钢铁一般的决心！
