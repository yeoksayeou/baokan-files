    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 8th. Paris dispatch: In the French election struggle, the reactionary parties' attempts to collude with foreign countries to thwart democratic forces have become increasingly exposed. According to a TASS dispatch from the 3rd, a major provocation is underway in Paris, attempting to hinder the election campaign of democratic organizations. Pierre Olsen, director of the Paris International News Bureau, spread the news to the Paris press, saying: "Certain conservative organizations in France have submitted a request to the American Embassy in Paris, asking for weapons to aid them, because they believe that an armed conflict with the Communist Party is inevitable in the election." Olsen also said that the US Embassy believes that the internal situation in France is extremely tense and reported to Washington: "The stability of France is in danger." Although the US Embassy denied this, Olsen repeatedly insisted that his news was reliable. Democratic newspapers revealed that American representatives negotiating with French companies in Paris have delayed signing agreements, and the American representatives warned that if the Communist Party participates in the new government, they will refuse to sign. An Associated Press dispatch reported that Cabi, an organizer of the de Gaulle Alliance, announced at the alliance's meeting on the 5th that their foreign policy was "alliance with the United States against the Soviet Union" and described the United States as "the only country that can help us."

    法国反动分子勾结美国干涉选举
    【新华社延安八日电】巴黎讯：法国竞选斗争中，反动派勾结外国以挫败民主力量的企图已日益暴露。据塔斯社三日电讯：巴黎现在正进行一种大挑拨行为，企图阻碍民主组织的竞选运动。巴黎国际新闻局局长皮尔生向巴黎报界散布消息说：“法国某些保守派组织已向巴黎美国大使馆提出请求，要求以武器援助他们，因他们认为在大选中难免与共产党发生武装冲突。”皮尔生并说美大使馆认为法国内部局势异常紧张，向华府报告：“法国的稳定已处于危险中”。虽然美大使馆对此加以否认，但皮尔生一再坚持其消息之可靠。民主报纸透露：在巴黎与法国公司谈判的美国代表已延缓签定协定，美国代表警告说：如共产党参加新政府，他们就拒绝签字。美联社电讯则报导戴高乐联盟的组织者卡毕之五日在该同盟的会议上，宣布他们的外交政策是“联美反苏”，并形容美国是“唯一能够帮助我们”的国家。
