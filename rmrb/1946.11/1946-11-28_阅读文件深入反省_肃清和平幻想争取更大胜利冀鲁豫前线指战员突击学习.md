    Eliminate Peace Fantasies and Strive for Greater Victory - Cadres and Fighters on the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Front Engage in Crash Course Study
    [This newspaper reporter team, 25th dispatch] Upon hearing the news of Chiang Kai-shek's invasion of Yan'an, the cadres and fighters on the Hebei-Shandong-Henan front felt even more grief and indignation. They responded to the call to "Defend the CCP Central Committee and Defend Chairman Mao" with the great victory of annihilating over 11,000 Chiang troops in Hua County. They are also actively intensifying their studies, eliminating thoughts of peace, and strengthening their confidence in victory in order to strive for greater victories. The Second Brigade directly under the Front Headquarters began a five-day crash course study on the 25th, using the Jiefang Daily editorial "On the War Situation" and the speeches of various leaders at the cadre mobilization meeting for the defense of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region on the 12th as weapons to eliminate the remnants of thoughts of peace and individualism. In addition to reading and reflecting on their own, each cadre held two discussion meetings in units of sections, extensively absorbing staff members to participate in the study. After the completion of the course, inspections and tests will be conducted.

    【本报记者团二十五日电】冀鲁豫前线指战员听到蒋介石进犯延安消息，益感悲愤，他们以滑县歼灭蒋军一万一千余人的巨大胜利回答“保卫中共中央保卫毛主席”的号召，并积极加紧学习，肃清和平思想，坚定胜利信心，以争取更大的胜利。前线指挥部直属队二大队于二十五日起，举行五天突击学习，以解放日报社论“论战局”及各领袖在十二日保卫陕甘宁边区的干部动员会上的讲话为武器，肃清和平思想及个人主义的残余。每个干部除自己阅读反省外，并以科为单位召开两次座谈会，广泛吸收事务人员参加学习，期满即举行检查和测验。
