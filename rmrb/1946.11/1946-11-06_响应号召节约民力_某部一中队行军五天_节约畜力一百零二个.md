　　Responding to the Call to Conserve Civilian Labor
    A Company of a Certain Unit Marches for Five Days, Saving One Hundred and Two Animal Labor Units
    [Report from this newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu Front] The "Zhoujiazhuang" company of a certain unit on our front line resolutely responded to the call by leaders Liu and Deng to rectify military discipline and conserve civilian labor, saving a total of one hundred and two animal labor units during five days of marching. In the past, this company found it difficult to move without a large number of livestock and civilian laborers. From the cadres to the soldiers, there was a prevailing misconception: that we are fighting for the people anyway, so what does it matter if we waste a little civilian labor? Since leaders Liu and Deng put forward the call to "rectify military discipline and conserve civilian labor," the company first broke with past misconceptions and responded to the call with practical actions. In a recent march, each detachment had eight or nine sick soldiers every day. According to the old method, the three detachments would have needed twenty-three livestock units every day. In addition, the special service platoon needed seven or eight civilian laborers to carry things. This time, the cadres led everyone to take action themselves. For the first two days of the march, the detachments did not need a single livestock unit. On the third day, there were nineteen seriously ill soldiers, and only three livestock units were used, which were sent back halfway. On the fourth day, three livestock units and one civilian laborer were used. On the fifth day, there were many sick soldiers with blisters on their feet, so seven livestock units and one stretcher were used, and four livestock units were sent back halfway. In total, the five-day march used thirteen livestock units, one civilian laborer, and one stretcher, which is at least one hundred and fifteen livestock units fewer than in the past, saving one hundred and two livestock units, accounting for ninety percent. Moreover, no one fell behind. (Original)

　　响应号召节约民力
    某部一中队行军五天
    节约畜力一百零二个
    【本报冀鲁豫讯】我前线某部“周家庄”一中队，坚决响应刘邓首长整饬军纪号召，节省民力，总计五天行军中共节省畜力一百零二个。该中队过去行军中没有大量牲口、民夫就难以行动，从干部到战士普遍的存在着一种错误观念：认为咱们打仗还不是为老百姓，浪费一点民力又算得什么。自刘邓首长提出“整饬军纪，节省民力”的号召后，该中队即首先打破过去错误想法以实际行动响应号召。在最近一次行军中每分队每天有八九个病号，按过去办法计算，每天三个分队就需要二十三个牲口，另外特务排担东西还得七八个民夫。这次干部领导大家一致亲自动手，第一二两天行军中各分队根本没有要一个牲口，第三天有十九个较重的病号，只用了三个牲口，还是走半路就放回去；第四天用了三个牲口一个民夫，第五天脚起泡的病号多，才用了七个牲口，一付担架，半路上又放回了四个牲口。总计五天行军共用了十三个牲口，一个民夫和一付担架，比之过去行军至少需一百一十五个牲口，节省了一百零二个牲口，占百分之九十，而且还没有一个掉队的。（原）
