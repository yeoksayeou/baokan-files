　　Communications Branch Telephone Team
    Commended for Hard Work
    [This Newspaper] The Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Communications Branch Telephone Team has been commended by higher authorities for its hard work in completing wartime communication tasks. Recently, Team Leader Jing led six telephone operators to dismantle telephone lines in a certain garrison area. In ten days, they collected over 10,000 jin of wire, 2,000 insulators, and more than 300 telephone poles. Deputy Squad Leader Liu Yujing and telephone operator Liu Wenchao climbed up and down poles three zhang high, their legs swollen, but they still persevered. Wang Zhanjiang and Duan Chou worked while ill, refusing to rest. Team Leader Jing, despite his age, set an example by carrying bundles of wire weighing seven or eight jin back and forth, showing no sign of fatigue. The people praised him, saying, "This old man is really energetic." Technician Zhang Songnian and seven telephone operators, who were in charge of the construction project at the new garrison area, also worked tirelessly from dawn till dusk, sweating profusely. The leading organs were able to establish telephone contact with all parties on the day they moved in. Within two weeks, the team erected 123 li of dedicated lines, buried 984 telephone poles, used 12,000 jin of iron wire, and installed 52 main and single telephones, completing all telephone communications for the military region's Party, government, and military organs and units. A section of the team's telephone operators working on the front lines of Ji-Lu-Yu worked even harder and more heroically, completing telephone command and communication tasks during the five major victories in the Ji-Lu-Yu battlefield, guaranteeing the victory of the war. In particular, the telephone communication work in the battle to annihilate Juye was the best, and it received two commendations from the leaders of the military region. Since its establishment just over a year ago, the team has achieved such remarkable work results. At its recent anniversary celebration, it received rewards from higher authorities and material慰劳 from fraternal units. The telephone operators were extremely excited and said, "We will work even harder in the future to ensure that telephone communications are always smooth during the war and to smash Chiang Kai-shek's attacks."
