　　Celebrating 100,000 Youths Joining the People's Liberation Army
　　Under the direction of American imperialism, after playing peace deception, the Kuomintang reactionaries completely tore up the Three Major Agreements and launched a full-scale offensive against the Liberated Areas. The steps of encircling the Central Plains in June, invading Northern Jiangsu and Southern Shanxi in July, and reoccupying Zhangjiakou in October implemented a complete break. Now, in the entire Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu region, they are wantonly slaughtering and plundering the lives and property of the people and the fruits of struggle with unprecedented brutality, and raping women. The compatriots in the entire region are filled with indignation that cannot be suppressed in the face of this new and old hatred and serious disasters. They are demanding to join the army to defend the Liberated Areas and to protect the solemnity and integrity of the Three Major Agreements. The CCP Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Central Bureau agreed to the people's demands and carried out two mobilization campaigns in July and October. The vast numbers of liberated peasants competed to enthusiastically join the army. In a very short time, nearly 100,000 youths have already marched and are marching in neat formations to the front lines. Countless men and women, supporting the old and carrying the young, with gongs and drums, joyfully sent off these glorious warriors to the front lines. This has greatly boosted the confidence of the broad masses of soldiers and civilians in victory. This is one of the important factors in our annihilation of thirteen enemy brigades, and this is a huge victory that we should celebrate.
　　When the mobilization to join the army began, many cadres lacked confidence, but the results were unexpected. From the deployment of mobilization to completion, it generally only took five to ten days. Not only was the task completed, but it also exceeded the original quota. This mobilization also saw many innovations in method. Generally, after the land reform was roughly completed and the masses gained the fruits of their labor, a large-scale meeting of activists was immediately convened to summarize the emancipation, recall the emancipation, and launch discussions on current affairs and joining the army. Peace illusions were criticized, and accusations were made in conjunction with the specific local conditions, denouncing the crimes of the big landlord Chiang Kai-shek. Many people were extremely saddened and angered in pouring out their grievances, which strengthened their hatred for the traitors and raised their class consciousness. Many people joined the army on the spot. Then, these activists were used to carry out large-scale publicity and mobilization among the masses, develop new heroism, and discuss who to join the army for and why to join the army, recognizing the glory of joining the army. A large number of activists for joining the army were absorbed and discovered, and they were connected to lead the broad masses to join the army and set off revolutionary competition. In joining the army, the masses themselves put forward clear slogans: "Strengthen the Eighth Route Army main force, and the fruits of struggle will be secure," "Fathers send sons, wives send husbands, we won't return home until we defeat Chiang Kai-shek," "Thousands of acres of land, ten thousand rooms, cannot buy the glory of joining the army," and so on. Communist Party members played an active leading role in this conscription. Party members accounted for nearly 15 percent of the young people who joined the army in the Taihang Second Military Subdistrict. When the party members of a village branch in Anyang swore an oath to the red flag, they said: "For national independence, for the growth of the party, and for the interests of the masses, we are willing to fight to the death with the enemy!" They showed unparalleled perseverance. In addition, many honored and demobilized soldiers rejoined the army. More than 400 demobilized soldiers in Pingshun voluntarily returned to their units, and many women also requested to join the army. Regarding the issue of preferential treatment for military dependents, the masses also put forward many methods. They spread a saying: "Military dependents have three no difficulties: they have houses, land, and clothes to wear." Taixi in Ji-Lu-Yu put forward eight guarantees for the lives of military dependents. Generally, military dependents received particularly large shares of the fruits of land reform. From this conscription, we saw a great force, which came from the masses' high degree of consciousness and enthusiasm. It is a clear contrast to the situations of conscription, forced conscription, buying conscription, and wailing in the KMT-controlled areas.
　　Why did we achieve this victory? First of all, because the Chinese Communist Party agreed to the peasants' demands for land and insisted on implementing land reform. The land problem has been solved for 20 million people in the entire region, and the principle of land to the tiller has been realized. The peasants have been liberated from thousands of years of feudal oppression and have become the masters of the land. Especially in the new areas, the masses have gained valuable political experience from their own most personal experiences. They once made a comparison themselves: before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the big landlord Chiang Kai-shek commanded his countless small landlords in the countryside to squeeze them together, making them live as slaves forever. The eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan were also subjected to the enslavement of Japanese imperialism until the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army came to truly liberate them. But today, the big landlord Chiang Kai-shek is coming to attack and seize their fruits again. They deeply feel that they cannot completely emancipate themselves unless they are armed to defeat the reactionaries. Only by following the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, only by fathers sending sons and wives sending husbands to join the People's Liberation Army, can the fruits of struggle be consolidated. Once the peasants are truly emancipated, they will understand this truth more clearly than anyone else; conversely, if the peasants' urgent land demands have not been resolved, or the fruits of struggle are only occupied by a few people, or the peasants do not rise up consciously and voluntarily, but are replaced by grace, the peasants will not understand this truth, and difficulties and deviations will occur in the expansion of the army. We achieved this victory also because we combined actual struggle with thorough implementation of land reform, implemented current affairs education, raised the masses' ideological awareness, and recognized that American imperialism has replaced Japanese imperialism, that Chiang Kai-shek's traitors have replaced Wang Jingwei's traitors, and that the collusion between Chiang and the United States is to eliminate the Liberated Areas and eliminate the Chinese people and their gains. The masses consciously mustered the courage to fight against Japan, dealt with American imperialism in the same way they dealt with Japan, and dealt with Chiang Kai-shek in the same way they dealt with Wang Jingwei. They enthusiastically joined the People's Liberation Army and became the most rational and conscious fighters; conversely, if we do not pay attention to regular current affairs education or do not regularly tell the masses about the situation of the struggle, implement open mobilization, patiently transform and persuade backward masses, or emphasize only the simple economic demands of a small number of backward masses, only seeking quantity and not quality, deviations will occur in the expansion of the army. We achieved this victory also because the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army truly served the people and sought the interests of the people in the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan and one year of self-defense warfare, establishing a flesh-and-blood relationship between the army and the people and truly becoming the people's own army. In the army, there is a good relationship between officers and soldiers. Therefore, when the reactionaries came to attack the People's Liberation Army, the broad masses of the people aroused infinite anger and enthusiastically joined their own People's Liberation Army, consciously loving and caring for military dependents as if they were caring for themselves; conversely, difficulties may occur in the replenishment of troops or it will not be easy to consolidate the troops that do not pay attention to the relationship between the military and the people and the relationship between officers and soldiers.
　　The joining of the army by 100,000 youths is a huge victory. This is the source of our strength in the Liberated Areas and the basic factor in defeating Chiang Kai-shek. In the future, when necessary, we will continue to mobilize to maintain the regular staffing of the main force, but we must pay more attention to scientific calculation, make reasonable adjustments to labor and military power, the people's burden, and war consumption, and especially protect the youth in the occupied areas and mobilize them to enthusiastically join the People's Liberation Army to fight for their own liberation and for the recovery of lost territories, so as to strive for a balance between the mobilization of the occupied areas and the core areas. In addition, we should also pay attention to improving tactics, reducing casualties, consolidating the troops, and the work of returning wounded soldiers to their units. Only in this way can we scientifically mobilize our human resources, support the long-term struggle, and achieve victory.

　　庆祝十万青年参加人民解放军
    国民党反动派在美帝国主义指使下，于其玩弄和平欺骗之后，彻底撕毁了三大协议，发动了对解放区的全面进攻，六月围攻中原，七月犯苏北晋南，十月复占张垣实行全面破裂的步骤，现正在我晋冀鲁豫全区以空前的残暴肆意屠杀掠夺人民的生命财产和斗争果实，奸淫妇女，全区同胞处此新仇旧恨和严重灾难之中，群情愤发，不可遏止，纷纷要求参军，武装保卫解放区，保卫三大协议的庄严和完整，中共晋冀鲁豫中央局同意了人民的要求，于七月和十月进行了两次参军动员，广大翻了身农民争先恐后踊跃参军，极短时间内将近十万青年已经和正在以整齐的行列开上前线，无数男女扶老携幼，锣鼓喧天，欢送此光荣战士走上前线。这大大鼓舞了广大军民胜利的信心，这就是我们歼敌十三个旅的重要因素之一，这就是一个巨大的胜利，我们应该加以庆祝。
    当开始动员参军时许多干部的信心是不够的，但结果出乎意料，从布置动员到完成一般只有五天到十天时间，不但完成而且超过了原来规定的任务，此次动员在方式上亦有了很多创造，一般都是在土地改革大致告一段落群众获得果实以后，紧接着召开大规模的积极分子会议，总结翻身，回忆翻身，展开时事及参军讨论，清算和平幻想，结合当地的具体情况进行诉苦，控诉蒋介石大恶霸的罪恶，许多人在倒苦水中都是悲愤异常，增强了对卖国贼的仇恨，提高了阶级自觉，不少人当场参军，然后经过这些积极分子在群众中大放手大宣传大动员，开展新英雄主义，讨论参军为谁，为啥参军，认识参军的光荣，大量吸收和发现参军的积极分子，由他们串连带领广大群众参军并掀起革命竞赛，在参军中群众自己提出了明确的口号：“壮大八路主力军，斗争果实才牢靠”，“父送子，妻送郎，打不败老蒋不回乡”，“千顷地，万间房，买不到参军的光荣”等等，共产党员在这次参军中是起了积极的火车头作用，太行二分区参军青年中党员几占百分之十五，安阳某村支部党员参军向红旗宣誓时称：“为民族独立，为党的壮大，为群众的利益，我们愿与敌人死斗到底！”表现了他们无比毅力。此外有很多荣誉和复员军人又都重新参军，平顺有四百多退伍军人自动归队，还有不少妇女要求参军。对于优待军属问题，群众亦提出了很多办法，他们流传着一句话：“军属三不难，有房有地有衣穿”，冀鲁豫泰西提出了对军属生活的八大保证，一般军属在土地改革中分到的果实都特别多。从此次参军中我们看到了一种伟大的力量，它来自群众高度的自觉和热情，它和蒋管区的抓丁、拉丁、买丁、鬼哭神号的情形恰恰成了一个显明的对比。
    为什么我们获取这一胜利呢？首先由于中国共产党同意了农民的土地要求，坚持实施了土地改革，在全区已有两千万人口解决了土地问题，实现了耕者有其田，农民已从几千年封建的压迫下解放出来，成了土地的主人，特别是在新区的群众从自己最切身的体验中获得了宝贵的政治经验，他们曾自己作了一个比较，抗战以前，蒋介石大恶霸指挥着他在农村中的无数小恶霸，一齐向他们压榨，使他们永远过着奴隶生活，八年抗战又饱受日本帝国主义的奴役，直到共产党八路军来给他们真正翻身解放，但今天蒋介石大恶霸又要来进攻夺取他们的果实，他们深切感到非武装起来打败反动派不能彻底大翻身，只有跟随共产党毛主席走，只有父送子妻送郎参加人民解放军才能巩固斗争果实。农民一旦真正翻了身他就比任何人都明白这个道理；反之没有解决了农民迫切的土地要求，或者斗争果实只为少数人所占有，或者农民不是自觉自愿的起来，而是恩赐代替的地方，农民就不会想通这道理，在扩军中就会发生困难和偏向。我们获取这一胜利还由于在彻底实行土地改革中结合实际斗争，贯彻了时事教育，提高了群众的思想觉悟、认识了美帝国主义代替了日本帝国主义，蒋奸代替了汪奸，蒋美勾结要来消灭解放区消灭中国人民及其所得的果实，群众自觉的鼓起打日本的勇气，以对日本的办法对付美帝国主义，以对汪精卫的办法对付蒋介石，他们踊跃参加解放军，成为最有理性的自觉的战士；反之不注意经常的时事教育或者不将斗争的形势经常告诉群众实行公开动员，耐心的改造说服落后群众或强调的是少数落后群众的单纯经济要求，只求数量不重质量，在扩军中就会发生偏向。我们取得这一胜利还由于八年抗战和一年自卫作战中中国共产党和人民解放军真正为人民服务，为人民谋利益，确立了军民血肉相连的关系，真正成为人民自己的子弟兵，在军队中则有良好的官兵关系，因而当反动派来进攻人民解放军时，广大的人民激起了无限的愤怒踊跃参加自己的解放军，自觉的爱护和照顾军属像照顾自己一样；反之不注意军民关系、官兵关系的部队，在补充中就会发生若干困难或者不容易得到巩固。
    十万青年的从军是一个巨大的胜利，这就是我们解放区力量的源泉，战胜蒋介石的基本因素，今后在必要时我们仍将继续动员以保持主力军的经常满员，但我们必须更加注意科学的计算，把劳力和武力，人民负担和战争消费作合理的调剂，尤须切实保护沦陷区的青壮年动员他们踊跃参加解放军，为自己的解放，为收复失地而斗争，以争取沦陷区与腹心区齐力动员的平衡。此外对提高战术减少伤亡，巩固部队和伤员归队工作亦应加注意，只有这样才能科学的动员我们人力的资源，支持长期斗争，取得胜利。
