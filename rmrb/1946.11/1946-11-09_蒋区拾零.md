　　Gleanings from the Chiang Kai-shek Area

　　Nanjing city has long changed into autumn attire, but in the bustling Taiping Road, Xinjiekou, Zhongshan East Road and other places, thinly dressed women are often seen leading two or three children, crying from hunger and cold, begging passers-by for help. They have come from afar to find their husbands, but when they arrived, their husbands had already been transferred to North China to attack the liberated areas. Now their travel funds are exhausted, and they have no relatives to turn to. Besides kneeling on the street and begging passers-by, their only remaining option is to throw themselves into the Yangtze River at Yanziji. (Shanghai Wenhui News)

　　A Shanghai red dance girl, Qiu Lanxi, after a dance one day, met an American soldier, Di Nan, and they went to a lodging together. At midnight, Qiu woke up and found that the American dollars and gold bars in her bag were gone. She chased out of the room and saw the American soldier trying to escape, so she dragged him to the police station. (Nanjing Renbao News)

　　Several hundred prostitutes from five hotels in Tianjin, including Beichen, recently sent representatives to petition the authorities and entertain reporters. The reason is that the authorities have ordered them to leave the hotels. A prostitute representative, Gu Shuzhen, said: the authorities had previously ordered them to "comfort the Allied forces," so very few Chinese are willing to come to them anymore. Now they are being told to move out of the hotels, which is tantamount to forcing them to die. Prostitute Gu said: "I am a graduate of Zhejiang Girls' Middle School. My parents depend on me for their livelihood. Because I could not find a job, and I could not bear to see my parents starve to death, I disregarded my shame and sold my body." The prostitutes demanded that the authorities withdraw the order to leave the hotels.

    南京市早换秋装，但在繁华的太平路新街口中山东路等处，近来常发现衣衫单薄的妇女，率领三两个啼饥号寒的孩子，向行人乞讨呼救。他们是从远道赶来寻找丈夫的，但当他们来到时，丈夫已被调到华北进攻解放区去了。现在川资用尽，举目无亲，她们除跪在街上向行人泣讨之外，只剩下向燕子矶投江一途。（沪文汇报）
    沪上红舞女仇兰茜，某日舞罢，邂逅美兵狄南，双往旅寓。午夜，仇女醒来，发现囊中美钞金条不翼而飞，追出房外探视，看见该美兵正图逃逸，乃将其扭送警局。（南京人报）
    津市北辰等五饭店妓女数百人，近推派代表向当局请愿，并招待记者，原因是当局限令她们离开饭店，一妓女代表顾淑贞说：当局过去曾命令她们“慰劳盟军”，因此中国人已极少愿意上门，现在叫她们迁饭店，等于逼她们死。顾妓女说：“我是浙江女中毕业生，父母皆靠我维持生活，因求职不得，又不忍父母饿死，才不顾羞耻，出卖身体。”妓女们要求当局收回叫离开饭店成命。
