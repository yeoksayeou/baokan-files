Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 4th: The 25th Division of the 52nd Corps of the Chiang Kai-shek army, which invaded the Kuandian and Huanren areas after occupying Andong, was completely annihilated in the area of Xinkailing, Hanjia Fort, and Ling@Yangbianmen, 30 kilometers northwest of Kuandian. Preliminary statistics of the battle results: Chiang Kai-shek's division commander Li Zhengyi, deputy division commander Duan Peide, and regimental commander Zhao Zhengguo and more than 5,000 soldiers were captured. More than 1,500 were killed or wounded, including regimental commanders. The captured materiel included five mountain guns, dozens of 60mm mortars, more than 100 light and heavy machine guns, 4,000 to 5,000 long and short guns, two armored vehicles, more than 20 trucks, and more than one million rounds of ammunition. Among the four American-made Chiang Kai-shek planes that coordinated the Chiang army's attack, one was shot down in Zimaogoumen, Kuandian, on the 1st. The Chiang army's invasion was carried out in several routes. One route consisted of two and a half regiments (more than 3,000 soldiers) of the 25th Division of the 52nd Corps. After departing from Xinkailing on the An-Shen Road on the 31st, they were surrounded by the Democratic Allied Forces in the mountainous area of Dadianzi, Sunjiabaozi, and Wangjiabaozi, west of @Yangbianmen. On the same day, more than 600 of the enemy were killed, wounded, or captured. On the 1st, the enemy attempted to break through but failed and were again annihilated by 600. On the 2nd, the Democratic Allied Forces encircled and attacked again, and the two and a half regiments of the division were completely annihilated. Another route consisting of more than 1,000 Chiang soldiers occupied Kuandian on the 2nd from Shanfengcheng. Another route departed from Andong, combined with more than 20 puppet bandits, and occupied Mao Huanzi, west of Kuanhuan, on the 2nd. Another route, combining with more than 500 puppet bandits, invaded Anping Duan, Kuandianzi, Sandao Bay, and Gulouzi, more than 40 miles east of Andong, on the 1st. The above routes were all met with head-on attacks by the Democratic Allied Forces, inflicting extremely heavy casualties. On the 1st, the Chiang army, which combined with puppet bandits from Yonglong, west of Xinbin, to invade Huaqianzi, a subordinate of Huanren, was also repelled.
