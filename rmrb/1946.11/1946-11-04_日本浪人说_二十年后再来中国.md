Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st - According to the Beiping World Daily's Nanjing dispatch: "According to those who recently returned from Tokyo, Japan's reconstruction work has been quite successful, and its diplomatic operations are extremely adept at maneuvering and ambition. Recently, the Ronin have even used 'Return to China in at most twenty years' as a slogan to encourage each other, which is why incidents of our overseas Chinese in Japan being humiliated still occur from time to time." On the 14th, the newspaper commented on this matter, saying: "We should be shocked by the expectations of the Japanese Ronin!" The newspaper stated: "The ruling power in Japan is still in the hands of the old ruling class. The Emperor system, with the support of the United States, is becoming increasingly stable. Japan is taking advantage of new international contradictions to escape famine and economic chaos, especially due to the large-scale import of cotton, rice, and flour, as well as the permission to expand fishing zones, which has given it an accelerating force for recovery economically." "China is following the United States in its policy towards Japan, but in the context of the US-Soviet antagonism, China's policy towards Japan has become a misstep. Now the Japanese have shouted the slogan 'Return to China in twenty years.' Given what we are showing now, Japan's resurgence and renewed invasion of China will not take twenty years."

　　日本浪人说
    二十年后再来中国
    【新华社延安一日电】据北平世界日报载南京专电称：“据最近由东京回国者谈，日本之复兴工作颇有成就，外交之运用亦极尽纵横活跃之能事与野心，浪人近更以“最多二十年再去中国”为口号，互相鼓励，因之我在日侨胞仍时有受辱事件发生。”十四日，该报就此事评称：“日本浪人的期望，我们听了应如何惊心动魄！”该报称：“日本统治权依然操在旧统治阶级手中，天皇制在美国支持下反而日趋稳定，日本利用新的国际矛盾而逃出饥荒与经济混乱，尤其是因了大量棉米面的输入以及准许扩大捕鱼区，在经济上给了它加速的复兴力量。”“中国在对日政策上是追随美国，然而在美苏对立关系中中国的对日政策实已进退失策。现在日本人已喊出“二十年后再去中国”的口号，以我们现在所表现的种种，则日本之再起与再度侵略中国并不需要二十年。”
