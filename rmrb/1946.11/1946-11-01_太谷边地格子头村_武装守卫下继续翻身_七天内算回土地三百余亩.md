　　Gezitou Village in the Border Area of Taigu
    Continuing to Overturn the Land Under Armed Guard
    Over 300 Mu of Land Returned in Seven Days
    [This newspaper Changzhi News] The masses of Gezitou Village in the border area of Taigu broke through their mentality of retreat, and combined preparations for armed self-defense to re-ignite the movement to overturn the old order. This village had undergone a struggle to overturn the old order this spring, and was invaded by the Yan puppet regime in June, with the despotic landlords relying on the Yan puppet forces to coerce a reversal of the verdicts. Although the village was liberated again in late July, the masses' "the world is changing" mentality was more serious than before; they wanted to overturn the old order but were afraid to do so. The leadership immediately guided the masses in discussions: If we don't overturn the old order, will the Yan army not come to rob us? Are the people being robbed all people who participated in the struggle? In detailed discussions, a middle peasant, Mr. ×××, said: "Xijia Village didn't struggle at all, but this time their losses were the greatest." Poor peasant Du Sanbao said: "The three young men from our village who were arrested by the Yan army have never participated in the struggle! During the struggle, Du Baoqing recovered three mu of land and two shi of grain; this time, he was prepared and didn't lose anything." Everyone then clarified that "even if we don't struggle, the Yan army will not be polite." Farmer Tian Erhu said indignantly: "Only by doing it resolutely can we survive!" The leadership promptly proposed: "Unite the whole village, arm ourselves for self-defense, and continue to overturn the old order." On one hand, activists connected with the masses overnight to re-ignite the struggle; on the other hand, they carried out a major mobilization for combat, launching a scorched-earth policy. The old, weak, and sick were transferred outside the village, the militia strengthened their sentry posts, laid landmines, and blocked all roads. Thorough war preparations emboldened the entire village, and in just seven or eight days, they settled accounts with the big tyrant Du Jinli and toppled the special agent Little Baldy, who had led the Yan army to rob the entire village last time. The masses recovered 314 mu of land and 64 rooms, and immediately distributed them to 56 peasant households. In the struggle, the masses of the village enthusiastically signed up to join the militia, and their enthusiasm was extremely high. (Jin Zhu)

　　太谷边地格子头村
    武装守卫下继续翻身
    七天内算回土地三百余亩
    【本报长治讯】太谷边地格子头村群众打破退缩思想，结合武装自卫的准备工作，重新掀起翻身运动。该村今春曾一度进行翻身斗争，六月曾被阎伪侵陷，恶霸地主依仗阎伪，威逼翻案。七月下旬，该村虽重获解放，但群众“变天”思想较前严重，想翻身又不敢翻身。领导上当即引导群众讨论：咱们不闹翻身！阎军来了是不是就不抢？被抢劫的人是不是都是参加过斗争的人？在周详的讨论中，中农×××说：“西贾村根本没斗争过，可是这次损失最大。”贫农杜三保说：“咱村被阎军抓走的三个青年，他们从来没参加过斗争呀！杜保清斗争中收回三亩地、二石粮，这次人家早有准备，一点也没有损失。”大家于是明确了“即使不斗争，阎军来了也不会客气”。农民田二虎激愤的说：“只有坚决干才能活！”领导上当及时提出：“全村团结、武装自卫、继续翻身。”一面由积极分子连夜串通群众，重新掀起斗争，一面进行战斗大动员，发动空室清野。老弱疾病者转到村外，民兵加强岗哨，埋设地雷，封锁一切道路。周密的战争准备，使全村群众都胆壮起来，短短七八天内，即清算了大恶霸杜进礼、斗倒上次引阎军抢劫全村的特务小秃子，群众算回土地三百一十四亩、房六十四间、并立即分配与五十六户农民。该村群众在斗争中纷纷报名参加民兵，热情极高。（金柱）
