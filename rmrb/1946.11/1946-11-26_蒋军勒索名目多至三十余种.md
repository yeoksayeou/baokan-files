　　【This newspaper, Yangcheng, 20th report】Under the smokescreen of so-called "bandit suppression" and "disaster relief," Chiang Kai-shek's troops in Xiangling are actively extorting levies from the people. There are more than thirty kinds of tricks. According to incomplete statistics, there are more than a dozen kinds of grain requisition alone: "village public grain," "apportioned grain," "borrowed grain," "temporarily borrowed grain," "temporary public grain," "grain owed from purchase," "disaster relief grain," "panic purchase grain," "corvée grain," "military apportioned grain," "credit purchase grain," "cash purchase grain," "military supply grain," etc. There are even more names for money extortion: "comfort money," "premium money," "gun money," "disaster relief money," "public expenditure," "fright money," etc. Even daily necessities such as hemp shoes, towels, toothbrushes, bowls, and chopsticks... are all donated and assigned. In Nanliang Village, eight *lü* (a neighborhood unit), were assigned sixteen overcoats, six hundred and forty *zhang* of homespun cloth, twenty-four *jin* of refined cotton, and fourteen million four hundred thousand yuan in expenses within twenty days. In five days, more than one hundred *shi* of wheat were robbed, along with eighty million yuan. In Fan Village, which has only one *lü* or so, forty-two *shi* of wheat, twenty-four million yuan, eighty-four *chi* of bullet bag cloth, fifteen hundred *jin* of fodder, three thousand *jin* of grass, and six hundred *jin* of wheat bran were forcibly extorted within half a month. Two small businesses in Dengzhuang Town were swindled out of ten million yuan in silver dollars within twenty days, and as a result, they had to close down. The common people all said bitterly: "There is no end to the money and grain demands. The people suffer, and Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan get rich." "If Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan don't die, the great disaster won't stop."

　　蒋军勒索名目多至三十余种
    【本报阳城二十日电】襄陵蒋军在其所谓“剿匪”“救灾”的烟幕下，积极向人民横征勒索，花样多至三十余种，据不完全统计，仅派粮即有十几种：“村公粮”、“摊粮”、“借粮”、“暂借粮”、“暂公粮”、“欠购粮”、“救灾粮”、“抢购粮”、“帮差粮”、“军摊粮”、“赊购粮”、“现购粮”、“军供粮”等。索款的名堂更多；有“慰劳金”、“优金”、“枪款”、“救灾款”、“经公费”、“受惊费”等。甚至麻鞋、毛巾、牙刷、碗筷………………………………等日用品，也无不捐派。南梁村八个闾，在二十天内派大衣十六件、土布六百四十丈、净花二十四斤、经费一千四百四十万元。五天内被抢走小麦一百余石，款八十万元。范村只有一个多闾，半月内就被强索小麦四十二石，款二十四万元、子弹袋布八十四尺、饲料一千五百斤、草三千斤、麦麸六百斤。邓庄镇两个小商号，二十天内被讹去洋一千万元，结果只好关门歇业。老百姓都愤恨的说：“要款没尽要粮没完，苦了百姓，富了蒋阎”，“蒋阎不死大祸不止”。
