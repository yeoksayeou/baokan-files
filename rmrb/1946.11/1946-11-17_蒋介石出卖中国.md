Chiang Kai-shek Sells Out China
Wang Zongyi

At the cocktail party at the US Embassy in Nanjing on April 14, American National Day, Marshall frankly stated that "the Philippines is a model for mankind." The Chinese people were indignant upon hearing this, but Chiang Kai-shek's officials applauded and cheered. The United States uses all its military and economic power to support Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial civil war, and all that Chiang Kai-shek does is give the United States whatever it wants. Under the Chiang Kai-shek Kuomintang's auction policy, Chinese sovereignty has been almost completely lost, and American imperialism has become the de facto ruler of most of China under Chiang's control. The Secretary-General of the American Pacific Society once pointed out: "China is gradually becoming a huge colony of the United States, will become an affiliated country of the United States, and will become part of the State Department's overall strategy."

Since the landing of the US military in China last September, the US military has in fact occupied China's cities, seaports, air bases, and railways with Chiang Kai-shek's consent. The United States now has tens of thousands of Marines stationed in China, as well as four air force groups and a military advisory group of four to five thousand people. The United States and Chiang's army jointly defend and directly attack the Liberated Areas. The US troops stationed in China have been changed to permanent ground forces in China, and American soldiers' families have been transported to China in large numbers in preparation for a long-term stay. According to the Dagong Daily, the Kuomintang government plans to cede Qingdao to the US Navy to build a permanent base.

The US military advisory group in China has completely taken control of the Kuomintang army. The Kuomintang army's equipment, training, and supply are all the responsibility of the Americans. The Americans are even responsible for directing combat. In the American-equipped units sent to the Northeast and Jehol, American officers and school cadres participate in directing combat, and American officers use machine guns to supervise battles. The British Labour Party's newspaper, the New Statesman, said: "The US President has in effect become the supreme commander of the Kuomintang army," which is quite true. The famous American journalist O.H. White also pointed out: "In the eyes of millions of Chinese, their civil war is made in America, and we are the engineers of a unified strategy."

Along with the US military occupation of China, the US economic plunder of China has also intensified.

Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, the Kuomintang government has broken away from the pound sterling group and completely entered the gold dollar group (legal tender), relying entirely on US loans for support. The Kuomintang currency has been completely controlled by the US dollar. American banks in China not only engage in normal banking business, but also operate US currency. US dollars in Shanghai, Peiping and other places can be openly circulated in the market, which allows the United States to control China's foreign exchange and encroach upon China's monetary and financial sovereignty.

Last October, under foreign pressure, the Kuomintang government abolished import restrictions, and American goods poured in like a tide, causing a large number of Chinese national industries to go bankrupt. The Kuomintang government abandoned its protective tariff policy and continued to maintain the customs tariff signed in 1935 in order to facilitate the import of American goods; moreover, the power of taxation was also handed over to the United States. The National Bureau of Commerce has long been an American, and this year the Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs has been replaced by a foreigner.

In April, the new Company Law was officially promulgated and implemented, giving foreign companies special privileges and allowing foreign monopoly capital to completely control China's foreign exchange.

China's important industrial and mining and transportation enterprises have also been continuously sold out by Chiang Kai-shek. What we know now is that light metal resources such as manganese in Shandong and the Northeast, oil fields in Northwest China, important munitions raw materials, aluminum mines in the provinces of Dian, Xiang and Gan, and China's electric power, electrical and steelmaking industries have been sold to various American companies. The Yuehan Railway was also sold to the United States, and coastal fishing rights, the high-grade cigarette industry, and coal exports were sold to the Japanese government under MacArthur's rule. In addition, the industrial and mining and transportation enterprises in Shaoyang and Shaoguan mining areas in central Hunan and southern Hunan, and in southwest China and Taiwan, will also be directly operated by the United States.

In agriculture, the "Sino-American Agricultural Technology Cooperation Group" was officially established in late June this year. The head of the group, Hutchison, announced that special attention will be paid to the improvement and increased production of Chinese wool, tung oil, silk, and tea needed by the United States. In the "International Trade Proposal," the United States openly declared China as an exporting country of "raw commodities" in market relations, which is actually a reprint of "Industrial Japan, Agricultural China." The task of the "Sino-American Agricultural Technology Cooperation Group" is obviously here.

Under the US military and economic invasion, China's airspace, territorial waters, ports, and inland river navigation rights are no longer ours. Recently, they were ceded in the form of treaties. In order to obtain more than 800 million US dollars worth of surplus materials, the Kuomintang authorities allowed American warships to freely occupy coastal ports and open inland river navigation rights for 30 years. At the same time, the sold-out airspace rights were also used as collateral for this transaction. The Sino-Philippine aviation agreement and Chennault's US-China Transportation Corporation are the specific results.

Under the strong pressure of the US military and economy, China's internal affairs are gradually being controlled by US imperialism.

The "Sino-American Cooperation Organization" jointly run by the US military and Chiang Kai-shek has long completely dominated the Kuomintang's police and secret services. The so-called "Sino-American Agent Training Class" has spread throughout the country. Recently, joint Sino-American police and military operations have been implemented in Peiping. Chiang Kai-shek allows American personnel of all kinds to collect various Chinese data and intelligence, especially military aspects. Chiang also secretly ordered the US military to engage in aerial photography in the inland provinces of China and Inner Mongolia and northern Taiwan.

American extraterritoriality in China has been re-established. An agreement on the "Regulations on Criminal Cases of US Military Personnel" was signed between China and the United States a long time ago, stipulating that criminal cases committed by US military personnel in China shall be adjudicated solely by the US military. Before the US military advisory group came to China, Wedemeyer had personally discussed with Chiang Kai-shek the issue of extraterritoriality for the group's personnel. Personnel from the United China Relief also requested this right. The Kuomintang authorities were invited to organize the "Sino-American Business Arbitration Council," which is generally rumored to be "arbitration jurisdiction" and "conciliation committee," but is actually a disguised "consular jurisdiction."

During the June negotiations, the Kuomintang government even proposed giving the final decision-making power over China's internal affairs to the Americans, which was opposed by the people of the whole country. Not long ago, in his "Ten-Day Ceasefire in Zhangjiakou" proposal, Chiang Kai-shek again attempted to offer this final decision-making power to Marshall and Stuart under the name of "announcement" rights. In a statement to reporters by a Chiang Kai-shek spokesman on October 16, China was compared to India, and Marshall was compared to the British Indian Governor-General Wavell, and the Chinese people were asked to "change their minds," which was certainly not accidental.

Chiang Kai-shek is even prepared to permanently offer Chinese territory to the United States. According to a Moscow broadcast on August 29 quoting a London radio report, Chiang Kai-shek proposed a plan to hand over the entire disputed area of China to the United States for trusteeship. A United Press reporter also reported this fact, saying that according to this plan, the Americans would have unlimited control over these areas.

The "Sino-American Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation" signed by the Chiang government and the United States on the 4th of this month further consolidated all the above-mentioned sales of Chinese sovereignty by Chiang Kai-shek in a "legal" form.

Faced with China's current heartbreaking situation, we are naturally reminded of all the famous unequal treaties in modern Chinese history. These treaties have given the Chinese people long-term suffering, but have not shaken China's independent status. However, the United States is now, with Chiang Kai-shek's cooperation, trampling on and damaging China's independence a hundredfold. What American imperialism has gained in China exceeds the sum of what all the imperialists have gained in China in the unequal treaties of the past hundred years. The United States occupies all of China's coasts and inland river navigation rights and directly controls the Chinese Maritime Customs Service. This is of course far more than the opening of coastal trading ports and the provision of low tariff rates in the 1842 Sino-British "Treaty of Nanjing" and the 1858 "Treaty of Tianjin" jointly signed with Britain and France. The consular jurisdiction in the "Treaty of Tianjin" has now been obtained by the United States through various "extraterritorial rights" agreements. The scale of American industrial and commercial activities in China is incomparable to the right of Japan to establish factories in Chinese trading ports and cities in the 1895 Sino-Japanese "Treaty of Shimonoseki." As for the long-term stationing of foreign troops in China, it began with the 1901 "Boxer Protocol." The "Boxer Protocol" only stipulated that a certain number of foreign troops should be stationed in Tianjin and certain locations, but now the United States is stationing troops in China, and the army, navy, and air force have all come, and they are not limited to being stationed in certain locations. The scope and scale are far greater than what the Boxer Protocol can compare. What is particularly worth mentioning is the "Twenty-One Demands" that Japan presented to Yuan Shikai in 1915. The first clause of the demands was to require complete control over China's internal affairs, finance, economy, and military. At that time, Yuan Shikai did not dare to agree to it rashly. However, American imperialism has now easily realized the "Twenty-One Demands" with Chiang Kai-shek's cooperation. The fifth clause stipulates that the Chinese government must hire powerful Japanese people as political, financial, and military advisors, and China must purchase a certain amount of military equipment from Japan or establish Sino-Japanese joint-venture arms factories in China, Sino-Japanese joint police forces, and the right to build most of the railways in southern China should be transferred to Japan, and Japan has priority in investing in railways, mines, and presiding over the rectification of ports in China. Current facts tell us that the United States is not completely and without omission realizing the contents of these clauses? Comparing the current situation in China with national subjugation treaties such as the "Twenty-One Demands," we can see that the United States, through its servant Chiang Kai-shek, is attempting to push the Chinese nation into the abyss of eternal national subjugation!

But Chiang Kai-shek can be a servant under American imperialism, but the people of the whole country do not want to be slaves to American imperialism. A hundred years of history have proved that the Chinese people are not to be humiliated. Since the Chinese people have not succumbed to Japanese imperialism, they will naturally not succumb to American imperialism. The Chinese people will eventually be able to finally defeat the attacks of the traitors, smash the shackles of imperialism, and realize an independent, democratic, and prosperous new China.

    蒋介石出卖中国
    王宗一
    马歇尔在四月十四日美国国庆日在南京美大使馆的鸡尾酒会上，坦白讲出“菲律滨是人类的榜样”，中国人民听了愤慨，而蒋介石的官员们却鼓掌欢呼。美国用一切军事经济力量支持蒋介石独裁内战，而蒋介石所作的就是美国要什么给什么，在将介石国民党的拍卖政策下，中国主权已丧殆尽，美帝国主义已成为蒋管区大半个中国的实际上的统治者。美太平洋学会秘书长曾指出：“中国渐渐成为美国的一个庞大的殖民地，将成为美国附属国，将成为国务院全盘战略的一部分”。
    自去年九月美军在中国登陆以来，美军事实上已在蒋介石的同意下，占领了中国的各都市、海港、飞机基地和铁路线，美国现在在中国驻扎着数万人的海军陆战队和为数四个空军大队，和为数四五千人的军事顾问团，美国与蒋军联防，并直接向解放区进攻，美驻华军队已改为中国地面常驻部队，美国兵员家属已大批运华，准备在中国长驻。据大公报消息：国民党政府并拟将青岛让给美海军，建为永久基地。
    美国驻华军事顾问团已完全掌握了国民党的军队，国民党军队的装备、训练、供给皆由美国人负责，美国人甚至负责指挥作战，派往东北、热河的各美械部队中，便有美军将校干部队参加指挥作战，作战时美军官用机枪督战。英工党机关报《新政治家》说：“美国总统实际上成了国民党军队的最高统帅”，是一点不错的。美国名记者。Ｏ·Ｈ怀特亦指出：“数百万中国人的眼中，他们的内战是美国制造的，我们是统一战略的工程师”。
    随着美国对华的军事侵占，美国对华经济掠夺亦形加紧。
    国民党政府自太平洋战争爆发后即脱离英镑集团，完全投入金元集团（法币），完全靠美国贷款支持，国民党货币已完全为美元控制，美国在华银行，不但经营银行通常事务，并且经营美国货币，上海、北平等地美钞，可在市面公开流通，这使美国控制了中国外汇，并侵夺了中国的货币和财政主权。
    去年十月，国民党政府在外国压力下，废除入口限制，美货潮水般涌进，中国民族工业大批破产，国民党政府放弃了保护关税政策，继续维持一九三五年所签订的海关税则，以便于美货输入；而且税权也交给美国，全国商务局早已是美人，本年度江海关税务司又换为外人。
    四月间，新公司法正式颁布实行，给外国公司以特权，并让外国独占资本完全掌握中国外汇。
    中国重要工矿、交通事业亦被蒋介石不断出卖，现在据我们所知的，即有山东和东北的锰等类轻金属资源，中国西北部油田，重要的军火原料，滇湘赣等省铝矿，中国电力、电气、炼钢等事业，分别出卖给美国各个公司。粤汉铁路也出卖给美国，沿海渔权、卷烟高等工业、用煤出卖给麦克阿瑟统治下的日本政府。此外，湘中邵阳和湘南韶关矿产区，中国西南及台湾之工矿、交通事业等，亦将由美国直接经营。
    农业方面，“中美农业技术合作团”今年六月下旬已正式成立，该团团长赫契生宣布，将特别注意研究美国所需要的中国羊毛、桐油、丝、茶之改良和增产。美国在“国际贸易建议书”中，美曾公开宣布中国在市场关系上作为“原始商品”的输出国，这实际上是“工业日本，农业中国”的再版。“中美农业技术合作团”任务显即在此。
    在美国军事经济侵犯下，中国领空、领海、港口和内河航行等权已非我所有，最近更以条约形式出之，国民党当局为获得买卖八亿余美元剩余物资，允许三十年内美舰自由占用沿海港口和开放内河航行权，同时，被出卖的领空权，亦被用作这次交易的抵押品，中菲航空协定及陈纳德美中运输公司即其具体结果。
    在美国军事经济强大压力下，中国内政亦逐渐为美帝国主义所控制。
    美国军方与蒋介石合办之“中美合作所”，很久以来即完全统治了国民党的警察和特务，所谓“中美特工训炼班”遍及各地，最近北平更实行中美警宪联勤，蒋介石允许美方各种人员收集中国各种资料、情报，特别是军事方面的。蒋并密令允许美军在中国内地各省及内蒙古、北台湾从事空中摄影。
    美国在华治外法权已重新确立，中美间老早便已签订关于“美军事人员刑事案件条例”的协定，规定美军事人员在华犯刑事案件，由美军单独裁判。美军事顾问团莅华前，魏特梅耶曾亲与蒋介石谈过，该团人员有治外法权问题，美联总人员亦要求此种权利，国民党当局应邀组织“中美商务仲裁会”，一般传为“仲裁法权”和“公断委员会”，实即为变相“领事裁判权”。
    在六月谈判中，国民党政府甚至提议把中国内政最后决定权也送给美国人，遭全国人民反对；前不久，蒋介石在“张家口停战十日”建议中，又妄图把这种最后决定权在“宣布”权的名义下奉给马歇尔和司徒雷登。十月十六日，某蒋介石发言人向记者发表的谈话中，把中国比作印度，把马歇尔比作英印总督魏菲尔，而要求中国人民“改变脑筋”，这当然不是偶然的。
    蒋介石甚至预备把中国领土永久奉送美国，据八月二十九日莫斯科广播引伦敦电台消息说：蒋介石曾提出一个计划，拟将中国整个纠纷区交给美国托管。合众社记者亦报导此一事实称：按照这一计划，美国人得无限制的管制这些地区。
    本月四日，蒋政府与美国签订的“中美友好通商航海条约”，更把上述一切蒋介石对中国主权的出卖，用“合法”的形式巩固起来。
    面对中国现在这样可痛心的情况，使我们很自然地记起中国近代历史中所有著名的不平等条约，这些条约曾给中国人民以长期苦难，但未动摇中国的独立地位，然而，美国现在却在蒋介石的合作下，更千百倍的蹂躏和损害了中国的独立。美帝国主义在华所得，已超过近百年不平等条约中各帝国主义在华所得的总和，美国占有中国全部海岸和内河航行权，直接掌握着中国总税务司，这当然远超过一八四二年中英“江宁条约”，和一八五八年与英法共同订立“天津条约”中开放沿海商埠和海关、低税率之规定。“天津条约”中的领事裁判权，美国现又以各种“治外法权”协定获得之。美国现在在华工商各业活动之规模，非一八九五年中日“马关条约”中日本有在中国通商口岸、城邑设厂权可比。至于外国得在中国长期驻兵，则是从一九○一年“辛丑条约”开始的。“辛丑条约”尚只规定外国一定数量军队驻扎平津和一定地点，而现在美国驻兵中国，海陆空军都来了，而且不限定在一定地点驻扎，其范围之广，规模之大，远非辛丑条约所可比拟。特别值得提起的，是一九一五年日本向袁世凯提出的“廿一条件”，该条件头号各款，系要求全部控制中国内政、财政、经济、军事，当时袁世凯尚未敢遽然答应，然而美帝国主义现在却在蒋介石的合作下，轻易实现了“二十一条件”。第五号规定中国政府得聘用有力之日本人充为政治、财政、军事各顾问，中国须向日本采购一定数量之军械，或在中国设立中日合办之军械厂，中日合办警察，中国南部铁路建筑权大部让与日本，日本有在华投资铁路、矿山及主持整顿港口之优先权，目前的事实告诉我们，美国不正是全部无遗漏地实现了这些条款的内容么？将目前中国的现状和“二十一条件”之类的亡国条约对照看来，就可以知道美国正经由其奴仆蒋介石，企图把中华民族推入万劫不复的亡国深渊！
    但蒋介石尽可以在美帝国主义手下当一名从仆，全国人民却不愿意当美帝国主义的亡国奴。百年来的历史，证明了中国人民是不可侮的，中国人民是既然没有屈服于日本帝国主义，自然亦不会屈服于美帝国主义，中国人民终必能最后击败卖国贼的进攻，粉碎帝国主义的枷锁，实现独立民主繁荣的新中国。
