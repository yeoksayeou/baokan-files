    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th. Yugoslav Radio broadcast: The final results of the National Assembly elections in the Federal Yugoslavia's two republics of Serbia and Croatia (Yugoslavia has seven states) show that 80 to 90 percent support the parties of the National Front.
    Another dispatch: Before the election, Marshal Tito, a candidate for the Croatian Constitutional Assembly, delivered a speech at a mass meeting of more than 200,000 people held there on the 3rd. He detailed Yugoslavia's democratic constitution, the friendship and unity of Yugoslavia's various ethnic groups, and the fundamental social changes that have taken place within the country. Tito pointed out: "Macek, the main agent of the anti-Yugoslav movement abroad, is the number one enemy of the Yugoslav people and is cursed by the people. They no longer represent any political group or party, but are merely hooligans of ordinary terrorists and saboteurs." Tito forcefully stated: "Anyone who wants to block the path of our people will be crushed like a caterpillar."

    【新华社延安十二日电】南斯拉夫电台广播：南斯拉夫联邦之塞尔维亚及克罗提亚两人民共和国（按南斯拉夫共有七邦）国民议会选举最后结果，百分之八十以至九十均赞成民族阵线各党。
    另讯：选举前克罗提亚立宪议会候选人铁托元帅，三日在该地举行的二十万人以上的群众大会上发表演说，他详述了南国的民主宪法，南国诸民族的友谊团结以及国内所发生的基本的社会变革。铁托指出：“国外反南斯拉夫运动的主要代理人马契克是南国人民第一号的敌人，受到人民的咒骂，他们已不再代表任何政治集团或党派，只是普通的恐怖主义者与破坏分子的流氓而已。”铁托力称：“谁要想挡住我们人民的路，他是会像小毛虫似的被辗碎的。”
