Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 24th -- In the past week, the military and civilians in the liberated areas of Hebei-Shandong-Henan and Jiangsu-Anhui have achieved great victories in resisting the invading Chiang Kai-shek's troops.

On the Hebei-Shandong-Henan front in Puyang, the Eighth Route Army annihilated more than 10,000 Chiang Kai-shek troops from Sun Zhen's group in the triangular area of Puyang, Hua County, and Changyuan on the 20th and 21st. This group had only five brigades in total, so the severity of their losses can be imagined. The Chiang Kai-shek troops' attempt to attack Puyang and control the Hebei-Shandong-Henan plains has suffered a severe blow. As General Liu Bocheng said: "The Chiang Kai-shek troops in Hebei-Shandong-Henan have begun to become passive." On the northern front of Jiangsu-Anhui, the elite Seventh Army of Chiang Kai-shek's troops, which invaded from the northwest of Huaiyin, suffered 2,000 casualties (killed, wounded, or captured) in six days. The Chiang Kai-shek troops had to withdraw the garrison forces from the major towns of Machang, Qinguang, Cheqiao, and Jingkou near Lianghuai to make up for the huge losses on the front line. This shows the expanded battlefield, the exhaustion of Chiang Kai-shek's reserves, and the dilemma of not being able to attend to everything. In the Northeast, the Democratic Allied Army in the Liaoji area annihilated all 800-plus Chiang Kai-shek troops who ventured out of Wushucheng North on the 17th.

On the border of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, near the central part south of ＠ County, west of Tongguan Yijun, southwest of Qingyang, and west of Yanchi, there have been constant skirmishes. Deputy Commander Peng recently returned from an inspection and praised the mobilization for self-defense and the fighting spirit of the military and civilians in the Border Region. The Eighth Route Army on the Luliang front in the Shanxi-Suiyuan Border Region, in order to coordinate the defense of Yan'an, recovered the cities of Yonghe and Daning on the 21st. The military and civilians in northern Shanxi also recovered the city of Huai Ren and the Gaoshan town and Kouquan railway station west of Datong.

Since Chiang Kai-shek launched a full-scale civil war in early July, he has lost forty brigades of his active forces. In the first two weeks of November, five brigades of Chiang Kai-shek's troops were annihilated.

　　蒋军后备枯竭顾此失彼七月初以来被歼四十旅
    【新华社延安二十四日电】一周以来，冀鲁豫及苏皖解放区等地军民抗击进犯的蒋军，获得很大的胜利。
    冀鲁豫濮阳前线，八路军在濮阳、滑县、长垣三角地带，于二十、二十一日共歼灭蒋军孙震集团的部队一万余人。该集团一共不过五个旅，其损失之重可以想见。蒋军进攻濮阳及控制冀鲁豫平原地区的企图，受到了严重的打击。诚如刘伯承将军所说：“冀鲁豫的蒋军已经开始转入被动。”苏皖北线，六天内共毙伤生俘由淮阴西北进犯的蒋军精锐第七军两千数百人。蒋军只好撤回两淮附近重镇马厂、钦工、车桥、泾口等地的守备兵力，以弥补前线之巨大损失。这表现战场扩大，蒋军后备枯竭，顾此失彼之窘态。在东北，辽吉地区民主联军十七日在梧树城北歼灭出犯蒋军全部八百余人。
    陕甘宁边区边境＠县以南中部附近，同官宜君以西，庆阳西南，盐池以西等地，不断发生前哨战。彭副司令最近视察回来，对边区军民的动员自卫与战斗情绪备致赞扬。晋绥边区吕梁前线八路军，为策应保卫延安，已于二十一日收复永和、大宁两城。晋北军民亦收复了坏仁城及大同以西的高山镇与口泉车站。
    自七月初蒋介石发动全面内战以来，他已丧失了四十个旅的有生力量。在十一月份的头两旬，蒋军有五个旅被歼灭。
