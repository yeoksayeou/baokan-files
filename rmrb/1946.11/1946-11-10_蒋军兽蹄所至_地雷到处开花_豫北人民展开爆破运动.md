　　Wherever Chiang's Troops' Hooves Tread
    Landmines Bloom Everywhere
    The People of Northern Henan Launch Landmine Warfare
    [This newspaper, Anyang News] Wherever the "Homecoming Legions" of Chiang Kai-shek tread, landmines bloom everywhere. In the recent Battle to Defend Shuizhi, the blasting team of our 117th District, accompanying the army, planted hundreds of landmines in Nanbeiguxian, inflicting great casualties on the enemy. The "Homecoming Legions," who have suffered greatly from the landmines, have repeatedly refused to act as pioneers for the "National Army." On the 29th, the enemy occupied Shuizhi, but dared not enter the city quickly. They began with two columns of trucks for reconnaissance. At night they camped on the walls of Shuizhi. The guerilla landmine warfare behind enemy lines has made the enemy feel even more of a headache. In early last month, more than 500 enemies departed from Wang Tianbang, attempting to eliminate our Luzhuang. The militia company of Shiwang was discovered by us and immediately counterattacked the enemy, who scurried back in disarray, detonating three landmines, resulting in more than ten casualties. On the 10th evening, more than 30 enemies returning fully loaded from looting in Jiuyan detonated a landmine in Dajian. The joint defense militia of Niujiagang, Dajian, and Hongyan heard the explosion and gave chase, scattering the enemy. We recovered four livestock and some clothing, and captured one person and one gun. The Cixian blasting team supporting Anyang, after burning down the enemy's Kuhe blockhouse, frequently operated and laid mines in Xiaocao, Wuguan, Houzhuang, and other places, greatly restricting the enemy's actions. The Seventh District team of the county has made many new innovations in laying mines. When they were laying mines in XX village in the Ninth District, they inserted a wooden sign at the mine-laying site, with the slogan "Oppose the traitor Chiang Kai-shek selling China to American imperialism." As soon as the enemy saw it, they fiercely pulled it out, and the landmine exploded, sending the enemy who pulled the sign to his death. The blasting campaign is now rapidly developing behind enemy lines. According to Chiang's soldiers captured by us in Shuizhi, due to our laying mines everywhere, the enemy's movements are greatly inconvenienced, and everyone is fearful. According to an intelligence officer of the Military Affairs Committee, if our landmines can all be insured, the casualties and threat to the enemy will be even greater. Currently, people in various parts of Anyang are vying to purchase landmines and hand grenades, and making their own stone mines, preparing to strike the enemy even more forcefully.

　　蒋军兽蹄所至
    地雷到处开花
    豫北人民展开爆破运动
    【本报安阳讯】蒋军“还乡团”兽蹄所至，地雷到处爆花。此次水冶保卫战中，我一·一·七区爆破队随军在南北固现埋了数百个地雷，给敌以很大杀伤、痛吃地雷之苦的“还乡队”已一再拒绝为“国军”作开路先锋。廿九日敌占我水冶，但却不敢很快进城，开始以卡车两列作试探侦察，晚间露营于水冶城墙之上，敌后爆破运动，更使敌人感到头痛。上月初旬，敌五百余，由王天邦出发，企图消灭我炉庄，士旺的民兵×连，被我发觉，即对敌进行反击，敌狼狈回窜，踏响地雷三个，伤亡十多人。十日晚，由九堰抢劫满载而归的三十余敌人，在大涧踏响地雷，我牛家岗、大涧、洪堰联防民兵闻雷起追，敌即四散奔逃。我夺回牲口四头，衣物一部，并俘获人枪各一，支援安阳的磁县爆破队，他们在烧毁敌库河炮楼后，即常在小曹、武官、后庄等地活动埋雷，使敌行动大受限制。该县七区队在埋雷上，有许多新的创造，他们在九区××村埋雷时，埋雷处插一木牌，上写“反对汉奸蒋介石出卖中国给美帝国”的标语，敌人一见，狠狠的一拔，地雷炸了，该敌拔牌者一命归天，现爆炸运动正在敌后迅速开展着。据我在水冶俘虏之蒋军士兵谈称，由于我到处埋雷，敌之行动大感不便，人人恐惶。据武委会情报干事谈，假如我们的地雷能每一个都保险，给敌杀伤与威胁将会更大。现安阳各地人民正纷纷争购地雷、手榴弹。自造石雷，准备更有力的打击敌人。
