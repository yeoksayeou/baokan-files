    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] At 10 a.m. on the 7th, representatives from the printing factory workers, the North China Xinhua Bookstore, the Taihang Xinhua Daily, and the cultural publishing circles of this newspaper, enthusiastically gathered to celebrate the 50th birthday of Comrade Wang Laoxian, a meritorious figure in the border region's printing industry, manager of the Xinhua Bookstore, and general manager of the Yongxing Printing Company. Amidst the deafening sounds of gongs and drums, the birthday celebration began. Old Wang was ushered to the center of the stage, densely decorated with congratulatory poems, congratulatory messages, longevity banners, longevity peaches, and longevity noodles, bathing the room in a sea of red. This newspaper's banner, "The Older, The Stronger," and the Yongxing Printing Company branch's banner, "Glory of the Party," complemented each other on either side of the birthday celebrant. Surrounding this veteran revolutionary were his close worker cadres and guests. After Chairman and Deputy Manager Pan reported on Comrade Wang's achievements, he said: Only after everyone's insistence did Old Wang allow us to celebrate his birthday. The best gift we can give him is to do our work well, which truly aligns with Old Wang's wishes. Comrade Zhang Panshi, Deputy Director of the Central Bureau's Propaganda Department and Director of this newspaper, delivered a speech stating: Old Wang has made significant contributions to the Party's printing industry. He is a shining banner for our cultural publishing circles. Comrade Panshi called on everyone to learn from Old Wang's excellent work style of being loyal to the Party, proficient in his profession, self-disciplined, and connected to the masses. When Comrade Chen Yan, director of the Taihang Xinhua Daily Printing Factory, spoke of how he was one of the thousands of workers who had grown up under Old Wang's diligent cultivation, the workers all focused their attention on Old Wang. This kind and amiable elder's ordinary face contained a touching strength. Comrade Wang Hua, director of the Yongxing Second Factory, Comrade Gao Wenming, director of the Fourth Factory, Comrade Chen Ai, head of the proofreading section, and others spoke in succession. They cited many exemplary facts from Old Wang's daily work and life, illustrating Old Wang's spirit of delving into and mastering his profession and his meticulous work attitude, which is worthy of learning for every comrade. Zhen Lübang from the General Affairs Section said: "Old Wang is so old, yet he resolutely refuses to ride an animal when going out. Several times I went to Handan by car, but Old Wang rode a broken bicycle. In many cases, it was the bicycle riding the man, which deeply moved me." After the guests spoke, Old Wang gave a reply, saying: Today, everyone is celebrating his birthday, which makes him even more aware of his shortcomings, and from his own history, it proves that only by closely relying on the Party and the collective strength of the masses can there be personal achievements. He fully agreed with the chairman's words that the greatest comfort for him is to strengthen unity and work actively. The ceremony concluded in the afternoon. (Chao)
