Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 4th. General Hao Pengju and General Bi Shuben, Deputy Commanders-in-Chief of the Central China Democratic Allied Army, recently sent a telegram to General Hu Jingduo on behalf of all officers and soldiers, congratulating him on the uprising in Hengshan, and encouraging him to "carry forward the fine revolutionary traditions of the past and work hand in hand to strive for the final victory of the democratic revolution."

Our Frontline Reporters' Corps, 2nd. Upon hearing the news of General Hu Jingduo, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Northern Shaanxi Security Force, opposing the civil war, Comrade Liu Binglin, an old friend of General Hu, from the Jilu-Yu Frontline Headquarters, sent a letter of condolence. The letter stated: "The victory of the Anti-Japanese War is the time for brothers to reunite. Unexpectedly, the bandit Chiang insisted on dictatorship, launched a civil war, destroyed the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, brought wolves into the house, betrayed the motherland, undermined democracy, and attacked the liberated areas. I am now following General Liu Bocheng in fighting on the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu front. During the unprecedented victory in the Battle of Juancheng, where we annihilated the traitorous army, I am delighted to hear that my brother has inherited the glorious tradition of the National Pacification Army, led his troops in an uprising, withdrew from the civil war, and dedicated himself to the people. This not only brings honor to friends and relatives but also greatly encourages the nationwide movement against civil war, dictatorship, and national betrayal. This heroic spirit of upholding justice and courage deserves to be recorded in history."

　　郝鹏举将军等贺胡景铎将军
    【新华社山东四日电】华中民主联军总副司令郝鹏举毕庶文两将军顷代表全体将士驰电胡景铎将军，祝贺横山举义，并以“共本以往之优良革命传统，携手并肩，争取民主革命之最后胜利”共勉。
    【本报前线记者团二日电】陕北保安队副总指挥胡景铎将军反内战消息传来，冀鲁豫前线司令部胡将军故交刘秉琳同志驰函慰问。该函内称：抗战胜利，正是兄弟聚首之时。孰料蒋贼坚持独裁，掀起内战，破坏政协决议，引狼入室，出卖祖国，摧残民主，进攻解放区。愚现随刘伯承将军转战晋冀鲁豫前线，鄄城一战，痛歼卖国军，获得空前胜利之际，欣闻吾弟继承靖国军光荣传统，率部起义，退出内战，效命人民。既为朋亲增光，且为全国反内战、反独裁、反卖国运动以极大鼓舞。此种仗义勇为英雄气概堪著竹帛。
