　　Avenging the Wounded Yang Juhe
    The Militia Team's Activities Become More Active
    [This Newspaper Jiao Zuo Special Dispatch] After Yang Juhe was wounded, the workers' team militia were indignant and their revenge activities became even more active. After Comrade Yang Juhe was heroically wounded, the militia not only didn't become pessimistic because of Yang's injury, but on the contrary, the anger of hatred for the enemy increased in the hearts of every militiaman. In the cold winter, they became even more active in guarding and monitoring the enemy on the mountains. On the 3rd of this month, the landmine they buried on the South Ridge of Liuzhuang wounded two secret agents. The enemy was so scared that they said, "Landmines are buried on the large and small roads in the mountains." They dared not disturb the mountainous areas. On the night of the 5th, a squad of our militia attacked the enemy strongholds of Wangfeng and Lifeng, frightening the enemies in other strongholds (Li, Dongwang, Xiwang, Dongfeng, Xifeng, five Fengs) to fire wildly for two hours, and they dared not sleep all night. On the 6th, in Niuzhui Village, a secret agent was captured. On the 7th, they also covered the masses to transport 150 shi of public grain for three days, and none of it was snatched by the enemy.
    The ×× village is six li away from the enemy. When they arrived at the village, the masses who had already moved away quickly returned. The masses of ×× village were afraid of the enemy, and only dared to sneak home to twist clothes during the day, and moved to the foot of the mountain to sleep at night. Since Yang Juhe's militia work team arrived, they now dare to stay at home. They said: "As long as the militia is here, we dare to stay at home." As soon as there is a situation, the sentry on the mountain of this village will immediately call the sentry on the mountain of that village to get in touch with each other and make preparations for each other. The militia attacks the enemy, and the masses move, forming a strong line of defense. The masses regard the militia as a backer. The mother of a militiaman from ×× village left a letter for him at home saying: "You (referring to the son) should work hard with Lao Yang (referring to Yang Juhe)! You must see it through to the end, don't care whether I live or die, as long as you are there, you can do it, and when you come back, don't be with those people (referring to the puppet self-defense corps in the village)."

　　为负伤的杨聚和复仇
    该队民兵活动更积极
    【本报焦作特讯】杨聚和负伤后该式工队民兵愤起复仇活动更积极。杨聚和同志英勇负伤后，该部民兵不但没有为杨负伤发生悲观情绪，相反的在每个民兵心头上增加了对敌仇恨的怒火，寒冷的冬天他们在山头上放哨监视敌人更加积极的活动。本月三日在刘庄南岭上埋的地雷炸伤了两个特务。吓的敌人说：“山上大路小道都埋着地雷。”不敢向山地出扰。五日夜我民兵一个班袭击王封李封敌据点，吓的其他据点（李、东王、西王东西冯封等五个封）的敌人一齐乱打了两个钟头，一夜不敢睡觉。六日在牛坠村，捉住一个特务。七日，又掩护群众转运了三天公粮有一百五十石，没有叫敌人抢去一点。
    ××村离敌六里，他们到了村后，已转移走了的群众，很快就都回来了，××村的群众因害怕敌人，只敢白天瞅空到家扭一遭，黑夜就转移到山根睡觉，自从有了杨聚和民兵武工队，现在他们也敢在家了，他们说：“只要民兵在，俺就敢在家。”一有情况，这个村山头即叫通那村山头的岗哨，互相取得连络，互相作准备，民兵打击敌人，群众转移，筑成坚强的一道防线。群众把民兵当成了靠山，××村民兵他娘留在家里给他捎来信说：“你（指儿）跟着老杨（指杨聚和）好好干吧！干到底才行，不要管我死活，有你们在就行，你们回来和人家（指村内伪自卫团）不是一伙人”。      （汝珍）
