　　Two or Three Experiences of Joining the Army
　　This time, in our region, based on the implementation of "land to the tiller," and implementing the Central Bureau's call to break with peaceful illusions, an unprecedented upsurge in joining the army was launched. Even in Rongguang Village in Qingfeng District, which had not had a military family since the War of Resistance, and a certain village that had not had a soldier since the Ming Dynasty, suddenly seventeen models of joining the army emerged. The experiences gained in the movement:
　　(1) From county and district cadres to village cadres, from activists to the masses, enlighten them layer by layer to form a movement. However, once the high tide of the movement is formed, the time should not be prolonged, generally six or seven days, to maintain the fullness of the masses' enthusiasm.
　　(2) Slogans should be put forward according to the level of awareness of the masses to enlighten them. For example, the leadership asked, "What if Chiang Kai-shek comes?" Activists said, "If he hits me, I will fight back, and I will never be a dead body at home." Some places asked, "If you don't go and I don't go, who will protect us?" It played a great enlightening role for the backward masses. When the leadership proposed "Good cadres and good members should become leaders in joining the army," it greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of cadres and members to lead the masses to the front line.
　　(3) Entrust the work of preferential treatment of military families and revolutionary martyrs to the masses. Wu Xun enlightened the masses to think: "The soldiers are desperately defending their hometowns in the front, what should we do in the rear?" The masses said, "If we don't do a good job in preferential treatment and resistance, we are not raised by human parents." In the "land to the tiller" movement, it was clearly proposed to "prioritize military families and then ourselves," and first solve the land and housing problems of military martyrs' families, fundamentally solving the preferential treatment and resistance work, and after democratic discussion by the masses, automatic mutual assistance and cultivation were carried out.
　　Special care should be taken for old military families, martyrs' families, and disabled soldiers in the preferential treatment of military families, and the "misconception of preferential treatment when needed" should be removed, which is extremely important for consolidating the morale of the troops. The specific method in Dongguan, Heshun: When implementing "land to the tiller," 44 military families, martyrs' families, honorably retired soldiers, and cadre families were the first to obtain or increase land, averaging (including active soldiers) 3.7 mu of land per person, and all those with labor had 4 mu of special good flat land. In addition, households with three people were given half the price of a donkey, and households with one person were given a quarter of the price of a donkey. In order to thoroughly solve their difficulties, the village established a cooperative for them. Top share methods: A. Disabled, widowed martyrs topped three shares. Eight years of resistance military families and cadre families topped two shares. New anti-resistance military families and cadre families after the liberation of Heshun last year topped one share. B. Top "difficulty points" of three to five points depending on the degree of family difficulty. No difficulty, no top points. According to the total value of the cooperative, each point is 1,000 yuan. After calculating the points, it is paid from the fruits of the struggle, and the rest can be freely invested. This method is very satisfactory to cadres, the masses, and military families.
　　(4) Grasp the work of the new recruit station. The work of the new recruit station (new recruit reception station) is an important link in raising the ideological awareness of new soldiers and consolidating the troops. Ren County New Recruit Station is called the New Recruit Camp; district cadres are appointed as instructors and camp commanders, and companies, platoons, and squads are set up, mostly democratically elected from new soldiers. A branch is also organized (directly led by the county party committee) to keep abreast of the soldiers' situation. At that time, due to the phenomenon of a few disguised purchases and bad elements taking the opportunity to mix in, discussions were launched among the new soldiers to make everyone clear that "joining the army is for oneself" and "it is not honorable to come for things." As a result, some soldiers returned things, and some unqualified soldiers were sent back to the village. In addition, a special agent from Guo Village was exposed, and the new soldiers were extremely enthusiastic.
　　New soldiers asking for leave to go home is a common problem in the work of the new recruit station. The solution in Feicheng's seventh district is: a system is established after everyone's democratic discussion, and tasks are given when asking for leave to go home. As a result, not only was there no reduction in personnel, but after a new soldier, five newer soldiers were developed.

　　参军二三经验
    这次我区若干地方在推行耕者有其田的基础上，贯彻了中央局打破和平幻想的战斗号召，掀起了空前的参军热潮。甚至象清丰一区抗战以来没有一个抗属的荣光村，以及自明朝以来就没有一个当兵的某村，也一下子涌现了十七个参军模范。运动中获得的经验：
    （一）是从县区干部到村干部，积极分子到群众，逐层启发，形成运动。但当运动高潮形成后，时间不宜拖长，一般是六七天，以保持群众热气的饱满。
    （二）要根据群众觉悟程度提出口号以启发群众。例如领导上提出：“蒋介石来了怎么办？”积极分子说：“他打我还手，决不能在家当死尸。”有些地方提出“你不去我不去，谁来保护咱”？对落后群众起了很大启发作用。而当领导上提出“好干部好会员要成为参军带头人”时，便大大鼓舞了干部会员带领群众上前线的热情。
    （三）把优待军烈属工作交给群众。武训启发群众去想：“战士在前方拼命保家乡，咱们在后方怎么办？”群众说：“不把优抗工作做好，不是人生父母养的。”在“耕者有其田”运动中，明确提出“先抗属后自己”，首先解决军烈属土地与房子问题，从根本上解决优抗工作，并经群众民主讨论自动互助代耕。
    在优待军属中要特别照顾到老军属，烈属及残废军人，去掉“用得着时优待的错觉”，对巩固部队情绪极为重要。和顺东关的具体办法：在实行“耕者有其田”时，使四十四户抗属、烈属、荣退军人、干部家属，首先获得或增加了土地，平均（连在役军人）每人有三亩七分地，凡有劳动力的，每人都有四亩特等好平地。此外凡三口人的户，分给半个驴的价钱，一口人的户，发四分之一的驴价。为彻底解决他们困难，村里又为他们成立了合作社，顶股办法：甲、残废、孤寡烈属顶三分。八年抗属、干属顶二分。去年和顺解放后新抗属、干属顶一分。乙、按家庭困难程度顶“困难分”三至五分不等。不困难不顶分。按合作社总值每分为一千元，算分后由斗争果实中出，余外可自由入股，这个办法，干部、群众、军属等都很满意。
    （四）抓紧新兵站工作。新兵站（新兵招待所）工作是提高新战士思想觉悟，巩固部队的重要环节。任县新兵站叫新兵营；由区干部任教员与营长，下设连排班，多由新战士中民主选出。并组织支部（由县委直接领导），经常了解战士情况。当时因有少数变相收买及坏分子乘机混入的现象，便在新战士中展开讨论，使大家明确“参军是为自己”及“为东西来不光荣”，结果有的战士把东西退出来，有的不合格的被送回村去，另外并把郭村某特务检举出来，新战士们情绪极高。
    新战士请假回家是新兵站工作中一个普遍问题，肥城七区的处理办法是：经大家民主讨论定出制度，请假回家时给予任务。结果不仅没有减员，且经过一新战士又发展了五名更新的战士。
