Xinhua News Agency, Ji Re Liao, 5th: Since Chiang's troops advanced deep into Rehe and occupied Chifeng and other places, the Eighth Route Army and local troops have been very active in central Hebei, behind them. In the week from the 12th to the 20th of last month, most of the highway from Ningcheng to Balihan, Xinba, and Malichengzi was destroyed, twelve bridges were destroyed, and more than 4,000 kilograms of electric wire were collected. On the 25th and 26th, a certain unit attacked important strongholds along the Ye (Baishou) Chi (Feng) line, such as Banzhuang and Nailin. On the 26th, a detachment of the Eighth Route Army attacked Riyedianzi, south of Chifeng, at night, killing and wounding more than 70 Chiang soldiers and immediately captured the area. On the 28th, a certain unit of the Eighth Route Army surrounded Liu Ziquan's unit of more than 200 Chiang soldiers in the Chifeng West forward area, killing and capturing 40 Chiang soldiers. With the Eighth Route Army main force and local armed forces persisting in the struggle, the vicinity of the Rehe transportation line and the vast rural areas are still in our hands, and land reform continues in various liberated areas.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 4th: The New Fourth Army in Lianshui continues to mop up the remaining Chiang Kai-shek troops. After recovering Jiaoling and other places, it recovered the important town of Qinchang, 25 miles south of the city, and more than fifty large and small residential strongholds on the 2nd, annihilating and capturing more than 300 Chiang Kai-shek troops. Furthermore, it was previously reported that the New Fourth Army annihilated and captured more than 1,000 Chiang Kai-shek troops in Jiaoling, Zhangjiawa and other places on the 30th and 31st of last month. It has been verified to be more than 1,500, including the 192nd Brigade (original division) headquarters and the five companies of the 575th Regiment and part of the 574th Regiment under its jurisdiction. The brigade commander (original division commander) Zeng Ze was wounded and fled in panic. During the battle, a platoon commander of the Chiang army led a squad to lay down their weapons voluntarily.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 4th (Delayed): The New Fourth Army in central Jiangsu actively withdrew from Xinghua City, northwest of Dongtai, on October 30th, to annihilate the invaders near the city as opportunity allowed.
