Urgent Mobilization to Defend the Border Region
*Liberation Daily* Editorial, December 12th

Chiang Kai-shek, with one hand, issued a so-called "cease-fire order" to deceive the people, while with his other blood-soaked hand, he was actively deploying forces to attack the border region and Yan'an. Chiang Kai-shek's deployment has been underway for half a month and is now largely complete. On the southern front, in addition to the four brigades that originally blockaded the border region, Hu Zongnan has also transferred two brigades from southern Shaanxi and four brigades (the 1st Division and the 90th Division) from Shanxi, totaling ten brigades. Ma Hongkui of Ningxia has mobilized two divisions, totaling five brigades, pressing on the western front of the border region. Launching an attack on the border region is only a matter of time.

The border region is the sacred place of democratic China. Chiang Kai-shek's attack on the border region and Yan'an is tearing off his last shred of pretense, exposing his true colors as a fascist bandit.

The people of the entire border region must urgently mobilize, fight desperately, shed their blood, and defend the border region, defend Yan'an, defend the land, defend the life of abundance, defend the Central Committee of the Communist Party! Now is the time!

First, we must recognize that Chiang Kai-shek wanted to attack the border region several times in the past but dared not do so. This time, he will definitely do it. Do not think that Chiang Kai-shek will not dare to do it again this time. Chiang Kai-shek and American imperialism fantasize about using one blow to completely eliminate the Chinese democratic movement. Attacking Yan'an and the border region is for this purpose. Chiang Kai-shek and his master, American imperialism, have made up their minds. It is wrong to have any illusions about them.

Second, we must have firm confidence in victory. Chiang Kai-shek's troops can be eliminated. In the past four months, we have eliminated one-sixth of his entire army, i.e., thirty-five brigades. Chiang Kai-shek has already used all his strength on the front lines, with no reserves left behind. Every one we eliminate is one less. Chiang Kai-shek's conscription and grain requisition have been met with opposition from workers and peasants all the way to landlords and capitalists, and he has not achieved the "results" he desired. Chiang Kai-shek's army is very dispersed throughout the country, weak everywhere. Now, drawing troops to attack the border region makes them even more dispersed, even weaker, and easier to eliminate. Chiang Kai-shek is already facing the biggest military crisis, and this crisis will be fully exposed in two or three months.

Third, we must fight to the end and swear not to surrender. In order to defend the border region, defend Yan'an, defend the land, defend Chairman Mao, and avoid becoming slaves to a conquered nation or slaves to Chiang Kai-shek, all men and women, old and young, in the entire border region must arm themselves, everyone must fight desperately, everyone must be brave, abandon peaceful life, switch to wartime life, grit our teeth, and fight to the end against the fascist reactionaries who are attacking the border region and the liberated areas, swearing not to surrender. If we can do this, we will surely win.

Commanders, fighters, and logistics personnel of the border region's army! The glorious days have arrived. You are standing in the most glorious positions. The people of all of China and the world are watching you, placing great hopes on you. Everything that Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu have taught us, now is the time to put it into practice. You must be resolutely thorough in annihilating the enemy; for the people, you must strictly abide by the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention, and never forget that you are the sons and daughters of the people.

People's guerrillas, militiamen, and staff members of the entire border region! Do not waste a moment! Immediately rise up and join the army in large numbers, take up your weapons, keep a close watch, arrest special agents and spies, fortify the villages and clear the fields, bury grain and utensils, launch guerrilla warfare and mine warfare, comfort the army, help the army with transportation and stretcher-bearing, join nursing organizations in large numbers, destroy the enemy's advancing roads and various means of transportation, help the army lead the way, send messages, scout the enemy, obey orders, obey commands, and do everything to eliminate the enemy and defeat the enemy.

Mobilize urgently to meet the battle! Since Chiang Kai-shek is coming to his death, let us wield the iron fist of the people and give him a crushing blow of destruction!

    紧急动员起来保卫边区
    解放日报十二日社论
    蒋介石一只手发表所谓“停战令”欺骗人民，另一只血淋淋的毒手却在积极布置进攻边区，进攻延安。蒋介石的这种布置已经进行了半个月，现在大体完成。南线胡宗南除原有封锁边区的四个旅外，又从陕南调来两个旅，从山西调来第一师第九十师四个旅共十个旅。宁夏马鸿逵调了两个师共五个旅，进迫边区西线。对边区发动进攻，只是时间的问题了。
    边区是民主中国的圣地，蒋介石进攻边区进攻延安，这是撕破他自己最后一点点脸皮，赤裸裸露出法西斯匪徒的本相。
    全边区的人民紧急动员起来，拚性命流热血，保卫边区、保卫延安、保卫土地、保卫丰衣足食的生活、保卫共产党的中央，现在是时候了！
    第一要认清蒋介石过去几次要打边区不敢下手，这一次一定下手，千万不要以为蒋介石这一次再不敢下手。蒋介石和美国帝国主义的幻想，是想用一个打击就把中国民主运动彻底消灭，打延安打边区，就是为了这个目的。蒋介石和他的主子美国帝国主义已经把决心下定了，对他们还有任何幻想都是错误的。
    第二要坚定胜利信心。蒋介石的队伍是可以消灭的。我们四个月来已经把他的全部军队消灭了六分之一即三十五个旅，蒋介石已经把全部力量用到前线，后面已经没有后备，打掉一个少一个，蒋介石的抓兵征粮遭到工人农民一直到地主资本家的反对，没有什么如他所要求的“成绩”。蒋介石的军队在全国分散得很，处处薄弱，现在抽兵来打边区，就更分散，更处处薄弱，更容易消灭。蒋介石已经面临最大的军事危机，这个危机在两三个月里就要完全暴露出来了。
    第三要打到底，誓死不投降。为了保卫边区、保卫延安、保卫土地、保卫毛主席，不做亡国奴、不做蒋介石的奴隶，我们全边区男女老幼武装起来，人人拚命，个个奋勇，抛掉和平生活，转到战时生活，咬紧牙关，同进攻边区进攻解放区的法西斯反动派打到底，誓死不投降。能够这样，就一定胜利。
    边区的军队指挥员战斗员和后勤人员们！光荣的日子到来了。你们是站在最光荣的岗位上，全中国全世界的人民眼睛都望着你们，他们把重大的希望寄托在你们的身上。毛主席朱总司令所教训的一切，现在是实行的时候了，你们对敌人要一往无，前彻底歼灭；对于人民要严守三大纪律八项注意，一时一刻不要忘记自己是人民的子弟。
    全边区的人民游击队民兵工作人员们！不要损失一刻时间，立即起来大批的参加军队，拿起自己的武器，严密放哨捉拿特务暗探，坚壁清野埋藏粮食用具，展开游击战地雷战，慰劳军队帮助军队运输和担架，大批加入看护组织，破坏敌人前进的道路和各种交通工具，帮助军队带路送信，侦察敌人，服从命令，服从指挥，一切为了消灭敌人战胜敌人。
    紧张的动员起来迎接战斗，蒋介石既然来找死，我们就挥起人民的铁拳，重重的给他毁灭的打击吧！
