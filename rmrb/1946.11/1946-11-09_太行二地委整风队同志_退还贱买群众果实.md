　　Taihang Second District Committee Rectification Team Comrades
    Return Ill-Gotten Gains from the Masses
    [Our Newspaper, Zuoquan News] The comrades of the Taihang Second District Committee Rectification Team, promoting the integrity of Communist Party members, have returned the ill-gotten gains they obtained from the masses' struggle. Since last year, some comrades in the team had bought the fruits of the masses' struggle at low prices. The Study Committee specially took time to lead everyone in discussing this issue. Initially, some comrades thought, "Now that the masses have been emancipated, the cadres' lives should also be improved!" Later, after discussion, it was unanimously agreed that this was the influence of Li Zicheng's ideology, and the ill-gotten gains were voluntarily returned to the masses. The following methods were decided for the return: (1) The original items should be returned to the original villages; (2) Items that had been damaged or used up (such as cloth made into clothes), as well as those that had been processed or modified and could not be returned, should be compensated to the masses for their losses at the prevailing local market price at the time; (3) Small gifts given by the masses, such as tobacco pouches and handkerchiefs, would be exempt from return, but clothes and fabrics, etc., must be returned. According to these methods, all comrades have returned all the ill-gotten gains. (Feng Taizhen)

　　太行二地委整风队同志
    退还贱买群众果实
    【本报左权讯】太行二地委整风队同志发扬共产党员的廉洁品质，退还贱买的群众斗争果实。该队自去年以来，部分同志贱买了群众斗争果实，学委会为此特抽时间领导大家讨论这一问题。开始时尚有同志认为“群众都翻身了，干部的生活也得改善呀！”以后经过讨论，一致认为这是李自成思想作祟，贱买的斗争果实均自愿还给群众。当决定退还办法：（一）原物退还原村；（二）已经损坏或用掉（如布作成衣服）以及加工改造而无法退还者，以当时当地市价补偿群众损失；（三）群众送给的零星礼物如烟袋、手巾等免退；但衣服布匹等必须退回。各同志根据此项办法，已将贱买果实全部退回。（冯泰镇）
