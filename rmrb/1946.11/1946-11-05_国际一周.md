    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st] Last week, Stalin issued another important speech with far-reaching global significance, which was his response to questions raised by Mr. Ba Li, the president of the Associated Press.
    Stalin's speech once again clarified the current tense and turbulent world situation. He firmly believes that "the current negotiations will lead to the signing of peace treaties and establish sincere relationships between the allied countries and peoples in the former anti-fascist war, thereby eliminating the threat of war provoked by the former Axis powers." Regarding the statement made by US Secretary of State Byrnes on October 18 that "Soviet-American relations have become increasingly tense," he gave a "disagree" response. This showed his firm confidence in the great strength of the world's people in defending post-war peace. The general trend of the post-war world is democratic peace and cooperation, which is the irresistible mainstream trend and the will of the people.
    Stalin also emphasized in his speech the serious threat to world peace, which is "the instigators of new wars, primarily Churchill and his allies in Britain and the United States." Stalin advocated that "these people must be exposed and eradicated." Regarding the question of "whether the United Nations organization can guarantee the territorial integrity of small countries," Stalin's reply was "it is still difficult to say." This response targets the current diplomatic policy of the US government, which on the one hand, pretends to be a "friend of small countries" in international conferences, and on the other hand, actually tramples on and threatens the independence of small countries. This answer also reveals the truth that if the United Nations is to become a truly effective international institution that can guarantee the independence of small countries, greater efforts are still needed from world peace advocates. On the German issue, in addition to proposing a solution to the future German problem, Stalin pointed out that the Potsdam Declaration "has not been consistently implemented, especially in the democratization of Germany." He advocated that "the remnants of fascism in Germany should be effectively eliminated in practice, and it should be thoroughly democratized."
    The United Nations General Assembly is still continuing its general debate. In the successive speeches of representatives from various countries, on the one hand, the voice of justice was truly issued on behalf of the people of the world. Foreign Minister Molotov of the Soviet Union and others advocated that the Security Council investigate the issue of the stationing of United Nations troops in non-enemy countries, which is of particular concern and welcome to the Chinese people. As a result of the illegal stationing of US troops in China and the US government's policy of aiding Chiang in the civil war, the entire Chinese people have been plunged into the suffering of a full-scale civil war. This action by the US authorities completely violates the United Nations Charter and the sacred spirit of various international treaties. The representative of the Chiang government hurriedly came out at the meeting to defend his "dad," saying that the stationing of US troops in China was "agreed by China," and expressed wholehearted "gratitude" for the US interference in China's internal affairs. On the other hand, the reactionary faction in the United States, secretly instigating some of its lackeys, launched a large-scale attack on the veto power, attempting to undermine the principle of unanimity among the five powers. From this point of view, the resolution of many issues in this United Nations General Assembly still requires arduous struggles.
    In the past week, the Bulgarian election again ended with the Fatherland Front winning by an overwhelming majority, and the Bulgarian Communist Party occupied the first place in the Fatherland Front. This is another brilliant victory for the people's forces following the referendum on the new French constitution. Before the Bulgarian election, there were disturbances by reactionaries internally and interference by a series of notes from American and British imperialism externally, but because the Bulgarian people deeply loved democracy and persisted in the struggle, the sabotage and interference policies of domestic and foreign reactionaries were bound to go bankrupt. Following the Bulgarian election, France, the United States, Romania, and Poland will hold parliamentary elections, which will be another review of the people's power.

    【新华社延安一日电】上周斯大林又发表了具有深远世界意义的重要谈话，这是对合众社社长白理所提出的问题之答复。
    斯大林的谈话再次澄清了目前紧张与动荡的世界局面，他坚信“现时的谈判将获致和约的签订而使前反法西斯战争中的联盟各国各族人民之间，建立诚恳的关系，因而能消灭前轴心国方面挑起战争的威胁”。对于美国务卿贝纳斯十月十八日演说所称“苏美关系已日益紧张”一节，他给了“不同意”的答复。这显示了他对世界人民保卫战后和平的伟大力量，是充满了坚强的信心。战后世界的总趋势，是民主和平与合作，这是大势所趋，人心所向的，不可抗拒的主流。
    斯大林在谈话中同时着重指出目前世界和平之严重威胁，“是新战争之挑拨者，首先是邱吉尔及其在英美两国同盟者”。对于这些人，斯大林主张“必须揭穿和铲除”。对于“联合国组织是否能使小国获得领土完整的保证”这一问题，斯大林的答复是“现时还很难说”。这一答复，针对着美政府的现行外交政策，一方面在国际会议上装扮“小国的朋友”的面目，另方面却在实际蹂躏和威胁小国的独立。这答复也启示这样一个真理，要使联合国成为真正有效的，能保证小国独立的国际机构，还需要世界和平人士更大的努力。在对德国问题上，斯大林除了提出解决未来德国问题的方案以外，指出了波茨顿宣言“并未经常执行，特别是在德国民主化方面”。他主张“应在实际上消除德国国内法西斯主义残余，并使其彻底民主化”。
    联合国大会迄今仍继续一般性的辩论，在各国代表相继发言中，一方面是真正代表世界人民发出了正义的呼声，苏外长莫洛托夫等主张安理会调查联合国军队驻非敌国问题，尤为中国人民所关切和欢迎。由于美军的非法驻华和美国政府援蒋内战政策的结果，已使全中国人民陷于全面内战的苦难中，美国当局此举，完全破坏了联合国宪章，以及各种国际条约的神圣精神。蒋政府代表在会上急忙出来为他“爸爸”辩护，说美军驻华是“经中国同意的”，而对美国干涉中国内政，更表示五体投地的“感激”。另一方面，美国反动派，暗中策动其若干喽罗，对否决权大肆攻击，企图破坏五强一致的原则。由是以观，这次联合国大会中许多问题的解决，还须经过不会没有艰苦的斗争。
    过去一周，保加利亚的大选又以祖国阵线压倒多数而胜利结束了，而保加利亚共产党在祖国阵线中，则占据了首位。这是继法国新宪法复决后，人民力量的又一辉煌胜利。在保国选举前，内有反动派的捣乱，外有美英帝国主义一系列照会的干涉，但由于保国人民的酷爱民主，和坚持斗争，终究使国内外反动派的破坏与干涉政策，不能不陷于破产之境。继保国选举之后，法、美、罗、波四国又将举行国会大选，这将是人民力量的又一次检阅。
