    Deepening of the Movement in Yugou Village, Xiyang:
    Crushing the Counter-offensive of the Local Tyrant Landlords
    [This newspaper reports] The masses in Yugou Village, Xiyang, crushed the counter-offensive of the local tyrant landlords, and the movement has deepened, completely turning the village over. Recently, the local tyrant landlords He Caiyi and He Qiusheng, etc., have used various despicable means to attempt to beat the village chief to death, incite infighting among cadres and the masses, and undermine the mass emancipation movement. Special agent He Qiusheng seized the opportunity of the village chief's poor attitude to instigate the masses to oppose the village chief, and spread rumors that the village chief had spent illicit money, etc. Some cadres and masses were confused for a time and fell for his trick. Feng Santang, the director of the militia committee, even arranged to struggle against the village chief. Later, the chairman of the farmers' association realized that something was wrong and determined that the masses had been deceived. He then convened a mass meeting to discuss: The village chief's attitude and work style are not good, which is wrong, but doesn't the village chief have any merits? The masses all said, "The village chief led us to emancipate ourselves this year, so the special agent landlords hate him and want to harm him. The special agent's opposition to the village chief is opposition to our emancipation!" So everyone suddenly realized and turned the energy of opposing the village chief into a more vigorous struggle against the special agent local tyrant landlords. The masses sent He Caiyi and He Qiusheng to the county for detention, interrogation, and punishment. The movement was rapidly deepened, and more than 70 shih of grain, 23 mu of land, and 127 silver dollars were liquidated from the local tyrant landlord Zhang Yu, etc., completely turning the village over.

    昔阳峪沟村运动深入
    打垮恶霸地主反攻
    【本报讯】昔阳峪沟村群众打垮恶霸地主反攻，运动深入，全村翻透身。该村恶霸地主贺才亿、贺秋生等，近来用各种卑鄙手段企图打死村长，挑拨干部群众内哄，破坏群众翻身运动。特务贺秋生抓住村长态度不好的空子鼓动群众反村长，并造谣村长花了黑钱等等。一些干部与群众一时糊涂，上了他的当，武委会主任冯三堂竟布置斗争村长。后来农会主席觉察到不对劲，断定群众是上当了，便召开群众会讨论：村长态度作风不好是不对，可是村长就没有好处吗？群众都说：“村长今年领导咱们翻身，特务地主便痛恨他，想害他，特务反村长就是反咱们翻身！”于是大家恍然大悟，把反村长的劲头转成更勇猛的反特务恶霸地主斗争了。群众把贺才亿、贺秋生送县扣起审讯处罚。迅速深入运动，又向恶霸地主张玉等清算出粮食七十余石，土地二十三亩，银洋一百二十七元，全村翻透了身。
