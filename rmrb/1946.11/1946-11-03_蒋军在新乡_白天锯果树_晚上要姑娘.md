[Reported by this newspaper from Handan] The people in the Chiang-occupied areas of Xinxiang are in dire straits. The burden is shockingly heavy. After the wheat harvest, the land tax has already reached 6.1斗 (dǒu, a unit of dry volume) per mu (a unit of area), exceeding the actual grain production this year by 100%. Each mu of land must also provide 72 jin (a unit of weight) of firewood and 12 bricks. Ordinary people cannot afford to pay, so they have to saw down trees (including pear and fruit trees) and chop them into firewood for the Chiang troops to burn, and dismantle well platforms and stoves to send to the Chiang troops for building bunkers. The number of corvée laborers is even more alarming. Chen Village, with 120 households, has to send 70 laborers every day to the Bao Public Office to deliver firewood, flour, and letters. Each Da Bao (large district) must also gather 50 full-time team members. All young men aged 18 to 45 must gather for half-day training every day in preparation for the Chiang troops to conscript them, resulting in barren fields. Each mu of land requires an additional subsidy of 5 shēng (another unit of dry volume) of wheat plus 500 yuan, but no one wants it even if it is given away. People are fleeing in droves, and many folk songs are circulating in secret:

"Damn the Central Government, rotten Central Government, the Central Government comes and there is no good time. Sawing down fruit trees by day, demanding girls by night, giving birth to children to send to old Chiang."

"Went to the Kou Shang Kou (mouth on mouth) (日), came to the sky on sky (天) (美), generations of descendants making trouble in the Central Plains, if Niu Ba (牛八, Zhu 朱) comes here, it will be a peaceful year forever."

　　蒋军在新乡
    “白天锯果树  晚上要姑娘”
    【本报邯郸讯】新乡蒋占区人民处在水深火热中。负担之重，骇人听闻，麦收后，每亩地已出粮六斗一升，超过今年实产粮一倍。每亩地尚须出柴草七十二斤，砖十二块，一般人民无力缴纳，只得将树木（包括梨树、果树）锯倒，劈成木柴让蒋军烧火，将井台锅台拆毁，送给蒋军修碉堡。差役之多，更为惊人，陈庄村一百二十户，每天要出七十个小夫到保公所送柴送面送信，每大保并须集中常备队五十人；凡年在十八岁以上四十五岁以下的壮丁，每天要集中训练半日以备蒋军抽丁，以致田地荒芜，每亩地倒贴五升麦外加五百元，往出推还没有人要。人民纷纷逃避，暗中流传着许多民谣：
    “糟中央，烂中央，中央来了没时光，白天锯果树，晚上要姑娘，生下孩子送老蒋。”
    “去了口上口（日），来了天上天（美），辈辈子孙闹中原，牛八（朱）来此地，永远太平年”。
