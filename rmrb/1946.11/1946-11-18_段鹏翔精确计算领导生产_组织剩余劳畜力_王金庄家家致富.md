    Duan Pengxiang Accurately Calculates and Leads Production
    Organizes Surplus Labor and Animal Power
    Wang Jinzhuang Families All Prosper
    [This Newspaper reports] Cadre Duan Pengxiang of She County, in leading the work of Wang Jinzhuang village, was able to grasp the village's characteristics and organize a large amount of surplus labor, so that the turned-over farmers of Wang Jinzhuang were able to go from living on bran and vegetables to "cultivating two, surplus one" within a year. Wang Jinzhuang was a poor village in She County, with an average of only 1.4 mu of thin land per person. According to precise calculations, the total labor force could spare more than 126,000 man-days annually, and animal power could spare more than 58,000 work-days. More than 600 women who could spin and weave mostly spent their time on needlework. Duan Pengxiang came here in March of this year, and the first step in his work was to carry out rent reduction. On the basis of the peasants' thorough liberation, he led production. During the spring plowing campaign, the masses agreed to mutual aid, but did not know the benefits of mutual aid. Duan Pengxiang directly went into a team, and after precise calculation, in addition to the work used for farming, the remaining labor could be organized to open up wasteland and dig up medicinal herbs. At first, they started in one team, and in half a day, ten laborers dug up medicinal herbs and earned 800 yuan. This caused a sensation throughout the village, and more than 50 mutual aid teams followed suit. In addition to retaining some labor for farming, they earned more than 30,000 yuan digging up medicinal herbs in three days. When summarizing the spring plowing in May, in addition to completing the farming ahead of schedule, they obtained 40,000 jin of firewood and reclaimed 160 mu of wasteland. Digging up medicinal herbs earned 120,000 yuan, and women's spinning and weaving also began to be organized during this period, earning more than 280,000 yuan in addition to weaving cloth for their own use. The surplus labor was no longer idle, doing unplanned and useless labor. The masses began to realize the benefits of being organized. The summer public grain wheat was completed by precisely calculating the labor force, leaving some people at home to produce, and extracting more than 200 male laborers and 60 livestock to sell grain in Wu'an. In five days, they earned a total of 90 dan of wheat, solving the entire summer burden. Based on these experiences, Duan Pengxiang advocated running small-scale cooperatives, absorbing idle funds and surplus labor for production. At the beginning, six people invested shares, and within a month, a capital of 12,000 yuan earned a profit of 13,000 yuan, influencing 345 households in the whole village to invest shares (operating separately), with a total capital of nearly 600,000 yuan. In two months, they earned more than 440,000 yuan in dividends, with an average income of 1,200 yuan per household. After the wheat harvest, after summarizing again, in addition to completing the summer tax, they also went out to do short-term work for 21 days, earning a total of more than 1.33 million yuan.
    After the autumn harvest and wheat planting, Duan Pengxiang led the mutual aid teams to summarize production. Cao Shan's team achieved "cultivating three, surplus one" from the grain harvested from the fields alone, and "cultivating one, surplus one" when calculated together with sideline occupations. The whole team laughed heartily: "Listening to Chairman Mao's words, we have become rich." The results of summarizing the 69 teams in the whole village showed that they had achieved "cultivating two, surplus one" and still had a surplus. Six of the 18 extremely poor households were promoted to middle peasants, and the rest were able to have enough to eat and wear. Looking at Duan Pengxiang's year of experience in leading production: The main thing is to conduct in-depth investigation and precise calculation, and organize the surplus labor into production that is most suitable for the masses' demands and needs, breaking through one point to promote the overall situation, so as to achieve the goal of organizing and enriching production.

    段鹏翔精确计算领导生产
    组织剩余劳畜力
    王金庄家家致富
    【本报讯】涉县干部段鹏翔，在领导王金庄村的工作中，能抓住本村特点，大量组织剩余劳力，因而翻身的王金庄农民能在一年内由糠菜渡日，达到耕二余一。王金庄是涉县的贫苦村，平均每人只有一亩四分薄田。根据精确计算，全年劳力每年能剩人工十二万六千余个，畜力能剩余五万八千余工，能纺织的妇女六百余人，大都把时间消磨在针工生活上。段鹏翔今年三月来此，工作第一步是进行查减，在农民彻底翻身的基础上，领导生产。春耕运动中，群众虽然同意互助，但不知互助的好处。段鹏翔直接深入了一个小组，经过精确计算，除种地用的工外，长余人力能组织开荒，刨药材。起初就在一个组先做，半天十个劳力刨药材赚洋八百元。这一下轰动了全村，五十多个互助组都效法，除留一部劳力种地外，三天刨药材值洋三万余元。五月总结春耕时，除提前完成耕种外，弄柴四万斤，刨荒地一百六十亩。刨药材赚洋十二万，妇女纺织也在这一段开始组织起来，除织自用布外，赚洋二十八万余元，剩余劳力不再闲散做无计划无用的劳动了，群众开始认识到组织起来的好处。夏季公粮麦子，是经过精确计算劳力之后，留一部分人在家生产，余抽出二百余男劳力牲口六十头到武安卖晌完成的，五天光景，共赚麦九十大石，解决了夏季全部负担。依这些经验作基础，段鹏翔提倡办小型合作社，吸收游资与剩余劳力进行生产，开始六个人入股，一个月内一万二千元本赚一万三千元利，影响全村有三百四十五户入股，（分着开办）共有资本近六十万，两个月赚红利四十四万余元，平均每户可收入一千二百元。麦收后再总结，除完成夏征外，又出外打短工二十一天，共赚洋一百三十三万余元。
    秋收种麦结束后，段鹏翔领导各互助组总结生产，曹善组单地里打的粮食达到耕三余一，连副业计算达到耕一余一。全组人哈哈大笑：“听了毛主席话，富起来了。”全村六十九个小组总结结果，达到耕二余一还有余。十八户赤贫有六户升为中农，其余均做到有吃有穿。纵观段鹏翔一年领导生产经验：主要是深入调查精确计算，把剩余的劳力组织到最适合群众要求与需要的生产上去，突破一点推动全般，这样就能达到组织起来，生产致富之目的。
