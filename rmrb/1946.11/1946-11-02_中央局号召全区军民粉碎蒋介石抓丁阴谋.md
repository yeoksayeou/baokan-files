　　【This newspaper, Handan, 31st】 Chiang Kai-shek's army, short of troops and further depleted by our massive annihilation, is now universally seizing recruits in the liberated areas it is invading to replenish its decimated and incomplete units. According to information obtained from the front lines: the Kuomintang Anhui Military Region has forcibly conscripted 1,500 able-bodied men in the Yucheng area of ​​our Hebei-Shandong-Henan region to replenish its battered Fifth Army. The Kuomintang's 11th Special District of Shandong Province has also ordered the conscription of 10,000 young men in Shanxian County and 20,000 in Caoxian County by the end of this month to alleviate the difficulty in sourcing troops for its civil war front. In order to protect the sons and youths of the border region and to thwart this vicious conspiracy of Chiang Kai-shek, the Central Bureau of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Region recently called on the military and civilians throughout the region and the occupied areas to extensively launch an anti-recruitment campaign. In the villages along the borders of the liberated areas, militia joint defense should be strengthened to prevent Chiang Kai-shek's looting of recruits; in temporarily occupied areas, young people should quickly organize themselves and take up arms to oppose Chiang Kai-shek's conscription; recruits seized in various places should also carry out armed escapes. At the same time, various localities should use the concrete facts of Chiang Kai-shek's forced recruitment and destruction of youth to educate the masses, so as to strengthen the masses' hatred of the reactionaries' plunder of youth, and launch an unyielding anti-recruitment struggle. The local armed forces of the Fourth Military Sub-district of Taihang have taken the lead in responding to this call and, on the 20th, annihilated Chiang Kai-shek's recruitment district office in Yangyimiao, Bo'ai, liberating more than 300 conscripted men. The local elders were deeply impressed upon hearing the news.

　　中央局号召全区军民粉碎蒋介石抓丁阴谋
    【本报邯郸三十一日电】兵力不足，复经我大量歼灭消耗的蒋介石军，现正在侵入的解放区普遍进行抓丁，以补充其被歼的残缺部队。据前线获息：蒋军安徽军区已在我冀鲁豫虞城地区，强征壮丁一千五百人补充其受创的第五军。国民党山东第十一专区，亦下令本月底在单县要抓青年壮丁一万人，曹县且须抓捕两万人，以解救其内战前线兵源的困难。晋冀鲁豫中央局为保护边区子弟青年，粉碎蒋介石此一毒辣阴谋，日前特号召全区及被占区军民广泛开展反抓丁运动，在解放区边沿各村应加强民兵联防，防止蒋介石的抓丁掠夺；在暂时被占区，青壮年应迅速组织起来，武装反对蒋介石的抓丁；各地被抓的壮丁，亦应实行携枪逃跑。同时，各地并应以蒋介石强抓壮丁、摧残青年的具体事实，向群众进行教育，以加强群众对反动派掠夺青年的仇恨，而展开不屈不挠的反抓丁斗争。我太行四分区地方武装，已首起响应此一号召，于二十日在博爱的阳邑庙，一举歼灭了蒋介石的抓丁区公所，解放被抓壮丁三百余人，当地父老闻讯，均感佩不已。
