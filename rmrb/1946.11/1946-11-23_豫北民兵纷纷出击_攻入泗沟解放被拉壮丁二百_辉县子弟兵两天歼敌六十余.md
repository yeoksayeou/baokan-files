　　Yubei Militia Actively Engages
    Attacks Sigou, Liberates 200 Conscripted Laborers
    Huixian Soldiers Eliminate Over Sixty Enemies in Two Days
    [Report from this newspaper in Changzhi] The militia along the Daoqing Railway are actively engaging. On the night of the 2nd of this month, the militia of the Fifth District, in coordination with the working team and a unit of the × Regiment, attacked the enemy stronghold in Sigou, killing four puppet district cadres, capturing seven secret agents, and liberating over two hundred conscripted laborers. On the 4th, Wang Zhaoxing, a major traitor from Xiguan, led forty enemies to Xiaqicheng to seize grain, but was intercepted by our militia and fled back into the city. We recovered over four thousand catties of grain, one ox and one mule each, four donkeys, and liberated over ten civilian laborers, wounding six enemies. The militia of the Sixth and Seventh Districts, in coordination with the army, penetrated deep into the enemy-occupied areas and recently captured thirty-four local tyrants in Zaojiaoshu, and killed a major local tyrant, opening up the work behind enemy lines in the Sixth District. In the border areas of the Seventh District, the flames of guerrilla warfare have ignited everywhere in seven villages. Under the fierce attacks of our militia, the enemy spies and local tyrants occupying Qinghua and Bo’ai are extremely frightened and have been spreading rumors that "the militia are all starving to death on the mountains" to deceive the families of the militia and the local masses, in an attempt to disintegrate the militia and make them return home. The militia of the Fifth District then launched an offensive to shatter the enemy’s rumors. On × night, they all went back to their homes. The militia of × village comforted their families and showed them the leftover fried cakes, and hung the fried cakes on the building in the village, with the words "This is what the militia eat" written next to it. Zhang Xiaochou, a militiaman from ×× village, told his mother after returning home: "The enemy wants to arrest recruits and kill activists, and deceived me into coming back to kill both of us. Don't worry about me, I have relatives in the mountains, relying on the Eighth Route Army, nothing is difficult!" Now the special agents and local tyrants feel even more uneasy about the unpredictable movements of our militia. (Duan Jiri, Li Ping)
    [Report from this newspaper in Huixian] On the 28th, the Fifth Regiment of the puppet Li Ying’s unit of the Jiang army’s Yubei Transportation Column invaded Pandizhuang and Dafosi in our Huixian County. At 2:00 PM, the enemy’s advance troops had just arrived at Dafosi and had not yet established a firm foothold when they were met with a heroic counterattack by a platoon of soldiers from Huixian County. The enemy was unable to withstand the attack, leaving behind eight corpses and fleeing in panic. We pursued the victory, killing or wounding over twenty enemies, capturing two alive, and seizing nine new Type 38 rifles, over eight hundred rounds of ammunition. We suffered only two minor injuries.
    [Another report] At dusk on the 27th, our “Hankou” × unit, with a rapid charge, occupied Beigu County, capturing over thirty defending enemies alive, and seizing over thirty rifles and one light machine gun. The “Shanghai” × unit simultaneously occupied Dongxiguzhuang.
    [Report from this newspaper in Anyang] Recently, the militia in our Seventh District have been actively striking at the enemy after they loot grain, and have also taken the initiative to attack the enemy. On the 3rd, over a hundred troops of the puppet Sun Dianying’s unit in Tangyin went to Gaodonggou to seize grain. Over a hundred militiamen from the Lingtou base point, under the leadership of our company commander Wu Jingting, engaged in a fierce battle with the enemy, killing two enemies and wounding three, and finally repelled the enemy. At 2:00 PM on the 5th, the "Homecoming Corps" Li Jingxing’s unit in Tianxi Town, combined with the bandits of the puppet Xu Jinsheng, totaling over a hundred men, went to Nanping to seize grain. The chairman of the Jiaokou Farmers Association immediately led over forty militiamen to engage in a fierce battle with the enemy until dusk. The enemy abandoned the corpses of a squad leader and below, and we captured a member of the "Caihao", and obtained twenty-seven American-made bullets, a white command flag, and a sleeve patch. At 10:00 AM on the 3rd, over three hundred members of the “Homecoming Corps” from Tianxi Town and Shanying launched an attack on our Seventh District Public Office in three routes. Our Seventh District Militia, in coordination with the Sixth District Militia, under the command of Vice Director Hou of the County Armed Forces Committee, routed the enemy, killing or wounding one enemy each, and we suffered no casualties. On the night of the 8th, over twenty militiamen attacked the Beishanying "Homecoming Corps," wounding one enemy, and then safely returned after distributing propaganda. In addition, for meritorious service in defending grain, the County Command has issued a special order to commend comrades Wu Jingting and Liu Chushou.
