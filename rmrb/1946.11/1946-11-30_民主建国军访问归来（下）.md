　　Return Visit to the Democratic National Construction Army (Part 2)

    (This article is a continuation from the 20th of this month. We apologize to the readers and the author for the interruption due to the publication of a long poem.)

    How exactly has this army changed? Commanders and fighters alike told me: "Because democracy has been implemented. General Gao Shuxun often tells his subordinates in instructions and orders: 'Only by thoroughly implementing democracy can we truly progress.'" With the superiors supporting democracy, a turnaround education was launched in the army, and soldiers were mobilized to speak out about their suffering. Many soldiers were brought to the point of bankruptcy by the Kuomintang's dark rule, and then tied up and dragged into the army. Thinking of their past tragic experiences, many soldiers wept bitterly. A complaint meeting in a company often took several days. After thinking about it, the soldiers discovered a truth: "Blame Lao Jiang and his dark rule." With the improvement of class consciousness, democratic conferences were held, where soldiers raised opinions to officers, and officers conducted self-criticism. The former did so with a calm and reasonable attitude, and the latter was able to "recognize and correct mistakes." Finally, both sides signed an "Officer-Soldier Pact," and a good officer-soldier relationship was thus confirmed in writing.

    It is said that the environment also has a significant impact on the army. During the Shahe conscription, many companies sent soldiers to visit; the scenes of the masses vying to offer comfort and enthusiastic farewells left a deep impression on the army. After seeing the liberated areas and thinking about the KMT-controlled areas, they all said: "We must make good progress. If we don't smash Chiang Kai-shek's dark rule, the Chinese people cannot be completely liberated."

    On the way from the division headquarters to the × regiment, we passed a river滩, in which there was a piece of land. Division Commander Chen said: This was opened up by the engineering company to help an old landlady. The old landlady thanked the engineering company and often said: "Don't you leave." The old lady with silver hair had no labor force at home, and the army gave her a lot of help. He murmured a small conclusion to her: "This is a good army." There are many such examples. The × battalion helped the folks in Dongpo to develop the mass movement, and the folks guaranteed that the army would not buy vegetables. The army helped the folks with summer and autumn harvests, and there was a enthusiastic scene of the masses comforting the army during the Mid-Autumn Festival.

    On the first of this month, I visited the family school of the Democratic National Construction Army. The school is located in a temple. Twenty-two spinning wheels were turning at the same time, and some people were making shoes, socks, and clothes. The family members were dressed simply, and some had begun to wear military uniforms.

    There are hundreds of family members in the Democratic National Construction Army, and organizing them to produce to establish their household is a major task. The school was established in August, with Mrs. Gao, Liu Xiuzhen, as the principal, and Mrs. Liao, Huang Bangwei, as the vice-principal. The headquarters set up a general school, the army and division set up branch schools, and the regiment set up a group. They have classes in the morning, production during the day, and criticism meetings on Sundays. The subjects include cultural and political classes, divided into advanced and literacy classes. Many family members lived in the liberated areas for a short period of time, put away their fancy clothes, and changed into coarse cloth clothes. Principal Liu spins yarn until her hands have calluses. The general school once sold eighteen catties of cloth and dozens of catties of yarn. In the words of Vice-Principal Huang, "This school not only supplements the daily expenses of the students, but also exercises everyone's labor concept. Some family members in the past suffered from the Kuomintang's abuse and discrimination against miscellaneous troops, and their lives were very hard. In Xi'an, they could nominally receive 42 and a half catties of family rations per person per day, but later it was changed to 400 yuan in legal tender, which was only enough for one steamed bun meal. Now they don't have to worry about food and clothing, and what they produce is their own, so their morale is very high." Mrs. Feng, the wife of Commander Qiao, once said meaningfully: "In the past, we also worked, but that was toiling for food and clothing. Today's production is to improve our lives. ......"

　　民主建国军访问归来（下）

    （此文上接二十日本版。中因发长诗停载，谨向读者及作家致歉。）
    这个部队究竟怎么样变化的？指战员一致告诉我说：“因为实行了民主。高树勋将军在指示命令中经常向下级说：“彻底实行民主，才能真正进行。”上级给民主撑腰，于是在部队中开展了翻身教育，发动士兵诉苦。许多士兵是被国民党的黑暗统治弄得倾家败产，自己又被一绳子绑了来的。想到过去的悲惨境遇，许多士兵痛哭流涕，一个连队的诉苦大会常常需要几天的时间，士兵们想来想去，发现一个真理：“就怨老蒋和他的黑暗统治。”阶级觉悟提高了，接着召开民主大会，士兵向官长提意见，官长进行自找检讨，前者因以心平气和，后者得以“知过改过”，最后双方订立“官兵公约”，一种好的官兵关系从此得到了书面的确认。
    据说：环境对部队也有重大的影响。沙河参军时，许多连队派了战士去参观；群众争相慰劳，热烈欢送的场面予部队以深刻的印象，他们看了解放区，想想蒋管区，都说：“咱们要好好进步，不打破蒋介石的黑暗统治，中国人是不能全翻身的。”

    从一师师部去×团，路经一个河滩，河滩中有一块地。陈师长说：这是工兵连帮助房东老太太开出来的。房东老太太感谢工兵连，经常说：“你们可别走哇。”那个鬓发如银的老太太家里没有劳动力，部队给了她许多帮助，他喃喃的向她作了一个小结论：“这是一个好队伍。”这种例子多得很，×营帮助东坡老乡开展了群运，老乡们保证部队不买菜吃。部队帮助老乡夏收秋收，中秋节出现了群众劳军的热烈场面。

    本月一日，我访问民建军眷属学校。学校设在一座庙里。二十二辆纺花车同时转动，另有一些人在作鞋袜和衣服。眷属们衣着朴，有些人开始穿上军衣。
    民建军的眷属有几百人，组织全们生产以建立家务是一件大事。八月间学校成立了，校长是高夫人刘秀珍女士，副校长是廖夫人黄邦玮女士。总校设总部，军、师设分校，团设小组。早晨上课，白天生产，星期日开检讨会，课目有文化课和政治课，分设高级、识字两班。许多眷属在解放区住了一个短时期，就把花花绿绿的衣服收起，改穿粗布衣服。刘校长纺线纺得手上生了茧子。总校一次就卖了十八斤布和几十斤线。照黄副校长的话是“这个学校不但补充了学员的日常费用，还锻炼了大家的劳动观念。也有一些眷属过去受着国民党虐待杂牌的歧视，生活很苦。在西安先前每人每日名义上可领四十二斤半眷粮，以后改成四百元法币，只能吃一餐蒸馍。现在衣食不愁，生产了是自己的，所以情绪非常高，乔军长夫人冯女士曾意味深长的说：“过去也劳动，那是为衣食而奔波，今天的生产是为了改善生活。……………”  （完）
