Launch a Comprehensive Anti-Counterfeit Currency Struggle
	Chen Qi
	In coordination with its all-out military offensive, the Chiang Kai-shek regime is massively and systematically counterfeiting border region currency. It is using various methods to smuggle it into the Liberated Areas, attempting to undermine our currency's credibility, steal our resources, and create economic chaos and panic in our rear areas. According to materials obtained over the past three months, it is fully proven that this destructive activity by Chiang Kai-shek is planned and organized. In the past three months, Chiang Kai-shek has counterfeited as many as twelve kinds of our border region currency. Counterfeiting locations include Anyang (Chiang Kai-shek-controlled area), Shijiazhuang, Xuzhou, Kaifeng, Taiyuan, Tianjin, and other places. Anyang is further divided into three printing locations, directly overseen by Wang Zi-quan, a traitor, and Sun Kexin, the puppet magistrate of Linzhang County, among others. They are printing six kinds of our Hebei banknotes: 1,000 yuan notes, red 500 yuan notes, blue 500 yuan notes, small-format blue 500 yuan notes, Taihang green "Ben Piao" 500 yuan notes, and brown 100 yuan notes. The majority are 500 yuan and 1,000 yuan notes, smuggled to both sides of the Pinghan Railway and the Taiyue District. From this, it appears that Anyang (Chiang Kai-shek-controlled area) is Chiang Kai-shek's main base for manufacturing and smuggling counterfeit currency, as well as a major stronghold for extracting our resources. The second is Shijiazhuang, currently counterfeiting our Hebei-Henan-Shandong 100 yuan notes (with a rice character), 1,000 yuan notes, and small blue-format 500 yuan notes. Other places such as Tianjin, Kaifeng, Taiyuan, and Xuzhou are also separately counterfeiting our Hebei-Henan-Shandong, Shandong, and Taiyue banknotes, systematically smuggling them into our Linqing, Taiyue, and Hebei-Henan-Shandong areas.
	Chiang Kai-shek's methods for pushing counterfeit currency mainly include the following: 1. Dispatching treacherous merchants, Chiang Kai-shek secret agents, and female secret agents to conceal counterfeit currency and steal resources in our area. 2. Openly using counterfeit currency to pay puppet troops and provide preferential treatment to puppet families. 3. Forcing and deceiving the old people who go to the Liberated Areas to exchange currency. 4. Publicly selling it in Chiang Kai-shek-controlled areas. When promoting it, they sell it in large quantities before it is identified by us; after it is identified, they sell it in small quantities or switch to another area to promote it. If the anti-counterfeit currency efforts are tight in the border areas, they promote it in our inland areas (especially in the heartland of Taiyue and Taihang), and if that doesn't work, they temporarily stop issuing it. Once the inspection is relaxed, they carry out large-scale promotions again. Recently, Liuyuan and Cuiqiao in Anyang have been selling it outwards every six or seven days, and the promotion time is very short and rapid.
	Based on this situation and the existing experience in various places, we should take the following measures in anti-counterfeit currency efforts: 1. Unify the thinking of cadres, so that cadres in all departments recognize the serious significance of this anti-counterfeit currency struggle, recognize Chiang Kai-shek's malicious scheme of combining war with plunder to destroy the economy and finance of our entire Liberated Area, and break the attitude of indifference to counterfeit currency. Some people think that anti-counterfeit currency has little connection with their own work, thinking that it is only the work of banks and economic departments. Some people receive counterfeit currency, know it is fake, but ignore stamping it with a "fake currency" stamp, fearing that they will suffer a loss, and instead find opportunities to push it out, unintentionally becoming promoters of counterfeit currency. Some people see counterfeit currency but are afraid of offending people and refuse to inquire, or are afraid of others suffering losses and let it go, which is harmful. We should adopt the attitude of "everyone shouting and beating the rat crossing the street," give full play to the spirit of being responsible for the Liberated Area and the broad masses of the people, treat anti-counterfeit currency as part of our own work, publicize it to the masses everywhere, and trace the root of the counterfeit currency when we see it. 2. Restore and establish counterfeit currency identification offices. 3. Conduct extensive publicity. Convene mass meetings or use various conferences to expand publicity and exhibitions, so that the masses can identify real and fake currency, explain Chiang Kai-shek's malicious scheme of combining war with destroying our rear area finance, arouse the masses' hatred, launch mass inspection work, cooperate with militiamen and troops to check pedestrians, and strictly monitor to prevent the circulation of counterfeit currency. Specifically convene meetings of merchants, exchange shops, exchanges, and administrative personnel of various agencies and accountants, explain the characteristics of genuine and fake currency and anti-counterfeit currency methods. 4. When necessary, it is possible to prohibit large-scale transactions in rural areas or implement collective counting methods. At markets, traders can count the money to prevent counterfeit currency dealers from deceiving the masses. 5. Implement rewards. Regardless of whether party, government, military, or civilians uncover counterfeit currency dealers, after the government interrogates and fines them, a certain amount of bonus will be offered to the person who uncovered them.

　　开展全面反假票斗争
    陈琦
    蒋伪为配合其全面军事进攻，在经济上大量而有计划的伪造边币，用各种方法向解放区潜销，企图破坏我本币信用，盗取我区物资，造成我后方的经济混乱与恐慌。根据最近三个月得到的材料，完全证明蒋伪此一破坏活动是有计划有组织的。三个月以来，蒋伪假造我边币竟达十二种之多。伪造地点有安阳（蒋管区）、石门、徐州、开封、太原、天津等地。安阳又分三处印刷，由王逆自全及伪临漳县长孙科新等直接主持，印我冀钞壹千元券，红色五百元券，蓝五百元券，小版蓝五百元券，太行绿本票五百元券，及土色一百元券等六种，大部分是五百元券壹千元券，潜销于平汉两侧及太岳区。由此看来，安阳（蒋管区）是蒋伪制造与潜销假票的大本营，也是吸取我物资的大据点。其次是石门，现伪造我平原百元券（带米字）、壹千元券和小蓝版五百元券。其他天津、开封、太原、徐州等地亦分别伪造我平原、鲁钞、太岳等钞票向我临清、太岳及冀鲁豫等地有计划的潜销。
    蒋伪推销伪币的方法，主要有以下几种：一、派遣奸商、蒋特及女特务潜藏假票来我区盗买物资。二、以假票公开给伪军发饷和优待伪属。三、强迫和欺骗到解放区的老百姓兑换。四、在蒋管区公开出卖。推销时，尚未为我识别前为大量倾销；被识别后则小量推销或另换地区推销。边沿区反假票反得紧了即向我内地推销（特别是向太岳、太行腹地），再不行则暂时停发。查得松懈了，再行大量倾销。最近安阳柳园、崔桥每隔六七天往外推销一次，推的时间很短很迅速。
    据此情况及各地已有经验我们在反假票上应采取以下的办法：一、打通干部思想，使各部门干部认识这次反假票斗争的严重意义，认识蒋伪结合战争掠夺破坏我整个解放区经济金融的毒计，打破对假票漠不关心的态度。有人认为反假票和自己本身工作没多大联系，以为这只是银行和经济部门的工作。有人接了假票，明知是假的却不顾盖假票章，怕自己吃亏，反而抽机会再往外推，无意中做了假票的推销者。有的人见了假票却怕得罪人不肯追问，或怕别人吃亏而放任不管，这都是有害的。我们应该采取“老鼠过街，人人喊打”的态度，发挥对解放区、对广大人民负责的精神，把反假票当成自己本身工作的一部分，到处向群众宣传，看到了假票就要追根。二、恢复与建立假票识别所。三、广泛进行宣传。召开群众大会或利用各种大会去扩大宣传，展览，使群众鉴别真假票，说明蒋伪结合战争破坏我后方金融之毒计，激起群众仇恨，展开群众性的缉查工作，配合民兵、部队盘查行人，严格监视不让假票流通。专门召集商人会，兑换所会，交易所会，各机关事务人员出纳会计人员座谈会，讲解真假票特点和反假票办法。四、必要时可禁止乡村大批成交，或实行集体点款办法。在集市上可由交易员点款，以防假票贩欺骗群众。五、实行奖励，不论党政军民查获假票贩，经政府审讯后罚款者，提出一定奖金予查获人。
