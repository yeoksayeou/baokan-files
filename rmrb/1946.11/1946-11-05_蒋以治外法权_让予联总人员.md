　　Chiang Grants Extraterritoriality to UNRRA Personnel
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st] Shanghai News: In October, the Shanghai Local Court handled the case of Wang De-yi and other residents of Zhenqie accusing Hayes, a foreign employee of UNRRA borrowed by CNRRA, of seizing land and digging up the Wang family ancestral tomb. The case revealed that the Chiang government had also granted extraterritorial rights to all UNRRA personnel. On October 16th, the court announced in court that the part of the case against Hayes was "not accepted" because the "Basic Agreement between the Chinese Government and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration" stipulated that "UNRRA personnel lent to China are exempt from any legal summons procedures." The plaintiff exclaimed that the people's lives and property were not guaranteed at all.

　　蒋以治外法权
    让予联总人员
    【新华社延安一日电】沪讯：在十月中，上海地方法院处理真茄居民王德一等，控告联总借予行总之外籍职员海斯强占土地及自行挖掘王姓祖墓案中，暴露蒋政府亦曾以治外法权，让予所有联总人员。该院十月十六日当庭宣布关于海斯被控部分“不予受理”，理由为“中国政府与联合国救济总署基本协定”中曾规定“联总借用给中国之服务人员，对任何法律上传讯手续，均可除免”原告乃大呼人民生命财产毫无保障。
