Jinan First Sub-district Achieves Great Success in Developing Communication Work; Jinan Branch Exchanges Experiences at Symposium

[Our newspaper, Weixian, 18th dispatch] The communication work in the Jinnan First Sub-district has progressed rapidly. Since the *Jinnan Daily* published the "Notice on Strengthening Communication Work" from the Propaganda Department of the Northwest Bureau of the CCP, the First District Committee immediately responded to the call of "the whole party running the newspaper." At the joint meeting of county secretaries in March, Political Commissar Xu Xia同志 made specific arrangements on the spot: (1) The propaganda departments of each county party committee should select cadres with a certain level of political and cultural knowledge who are enthusiastic about writing communications to serve as communication officers. (2) Each county should establish a central communication group led by the county party committee to promote and lead the communication work of the entire county and to personally write articles for the party newspaper. (3) Establish a backbone communication network led by the district party committee to achieve "write as you go" and "write about what you do." (4) Good cadres should cherish the party newspaper and use the party newspaper to exchange experiences and guide work. Since the spirit of "the whole party running the newspaper" was understood by the cadres of the First Sub-district, an enthusiastic writing campaign has been launched in every period of central work. For example, the national assembly elections of Wu Xun, the investigation and reduction of Yuan Dynasty, and the military service of Linqing, Wu Xun, and Yongzhi counties, each district launched a reporting competition. Comrade Li Gong of Guanxian led the writing, and Xin County announced that the district committee would lead the writing, and writing was designated as one of the conditions for model cadres. Guantao and Qiu County specially published the *War Newspaper* and the *Labor Hero Special Issue* to collect materials for the party newspaper and train correspondents. Before June, Yongzhi County wrote a total of 48 articles in half a year. After two months of the anti-traitor and grievance-airing movement and the personal supervision and urging of Han Ningfu, the District Committee, and Zhao Zhenqing, the County Committee, the county submitted 54 articles in October. Now, the eight counties and one city in the First Sub-district have added communication officers who directly promote and personally interview, and the number of correspondents has increased from 166 to more than 500.

[Our newspaper, Weixian, 23rd dispatch] The Jinan Branch of Xinhua News Agency held a symposium for communication officers from various counties on the 2nd of this month. Comrades from the Fifth Sub-district, Wu Xun, Qinghe, Julu, Weixian, Daming, Feixiang, and Linqing City attended. At the meeting, everyone provided a lot of valuable experience. Wu Xun's experience is: (1) Communication work must be combined with actual work. (2) It must be clearly stipulated that writing is also work. The general appeal should be combined with specific arrangements at the meeting. (3) Promoting organizational leadership should be combined with promoting active writers. (4) When summarizing work, communication work should also be summarized and checked. For example, when summarizing military service, the report on military service should also be summarized, and communication work should be regarded as one of the conditions for challenge. The Fifth Sub-district’s experience is: (1) In addition to making appeals and issuing instructions at the meeting, the party committee should also check the communication work on time. (2) Strengthening contact and supervision can play a big role. (3) Don't do it evenly and generally, you should focus on key counties and key areas. (4) Communication officers should be more proactive in their work. Qinghe’s experience is: (1) The central group should make a summary of communication work every month. Those who actively write should be encouraged and commended. (2) Collective research is a good way to improve the quality of manuscripts. When everyone discovers materials, they divide the work to write. After writing, everyone discusses. Julu's experience is: the personal supervision and inspection of the chief can play a decisive role. The party committee personally taking action and promoting inspection is the key to carrying out communication work.

　　发展通讯工作
    冀南一分区成绩很大
    冀南分社座谈经验
    【本报威县十八日电】冀南一分区通讯工作突飞猛进。自冀南日报发表了中共西北局宣传部关于“加强通讯工作的通知”后，一地委首先响应“全党办报”的号召。在三月县书联席会议上，许政委侠同志，当即具体布置：（一）各县委宣传部要抽调有一定政治文化水平、而热心写通讯的干部，作通讯干事。（二）各县要以县委会为主，建立中心通讯小组，一面推动与领导全县通讯工作，一面亲自动手给党报写稿。（三）以区委会为主，建立基干通讯网，作到“随作随写”、“作什么写什么。”（四）好干部要爱护党报，并运用党报交流经验，指导工作。“全党办报”的精神，自被一分区干部领会后，在每一时期的中心工作中，都掀起热烈的写稿运动。如武训的国大选举，元朝的查减，临清、武训、永智三县的参军，各区都掀起了报导竞赛。冠县立功同志带领写稿，莘县宣布号召区委带领动笔，并把写稿定为模范干部条件之一。馆陶邱县特出版《战争报》、《劳英专刊》，专为党报汇集材料，培养通讯员。永智在六月以前，半年间共写稿四八件。该县经两月来的反奸诉苦运动，及地委韩宁夫，县委赵振清同志的亲自动手督促，十月份就来稿五十四件。现在一分区八个县一个市，都增添了通讯干事，直接推动，自己动手采访，通讯员由一六六人发展到五百多人。
    【本报威县二十三日电】新华社冀南分社于本月二日召开各县通讯干事座谈会。到有五分区、武训、清河、巨鹿、威县、大名、肥乡、临清市等地同志。会上，大家提供了很多宝贵经验。武训的经验是：（一）通讯工作必须与实际工作结合。（二）明确规定写稿也是工作。在会议上一般的号召与具体布置相结合。（三）推动组织领导与推动写稿积极分子结合。（四）总结工作时要同时总结检查通讯工作。如总结参军，也应总结参军报导。并把通讯工作作为挑战条件之一。五分区的经验是：（一）党委除在会议上作号召与下指示外，并要按时检查通讯工作。（二）加强联系督促，能起很大作用。（三）不要平均地一般地做，应抓住重点县、重点区。（四）通讯干事在工作上应多主动。清河的经验是：（一）中心小组每月要作通讯工作总结。对写稿积极者给以鼓励与表扬。（二）集体研究是提高稿件质量的好办法。大家发现材料，即分工来写。写好后大家讨论。巨鹿的经验是：首长亲身督促检查能起决定作用。党委亲自动手与推动检查，是开展通讯工作的关键。
