　　"Annihilate the Invading Enemy in Jiaozuo!"
　　Er Dong
　　The enemy can come in alive, but they can't leave alive—the miners of Jiaozuo firmly believe this. Jiaozuo is ours, and the coal mines of Jiaozuo are ours. We only temporarily withdrew to eliminate the enemy more quickly.

　　This firm belief and hatred for the Chiang Kai-shek puppet regime come from decades of life experience, especially since the liberation in August of last year. Workers who have worked here for three generations can tell you many things about the pre-war era, the Japanese occupation, and the arrival of the Eighth Route Army. "Back then" (they collectively refer to the pre-war and Japanese eras as "back then"), workers went to work in the morning, and no one knew if they would return in the evening. Bean cakes and bean skins used to feed pigs were the workers' food. Workers were so hungry that they were skin and bones; countless numbers couldn't make it out of the mine after going down, and those who fell to their deaths after being blown off Li Feng Bridge by strong winds weren't even counted. If they were desperate and stole some coal to sell, the mine police would catch them and kill them by pouring cold water down their throats—that was for being unruly and not abiding by the law. After the Eighth Route Army came, in that one year, they led the workers to overthrow Hui Ergong (the former chairman of the mine committee, a Chiang Kai-shek secret agent and notorious traitor and tyrant), demanded back pay, increased wages, and ensured that every household had grain reserves and everyone had a place. "Living this one year is better than the previous decades or centuries. Why wouldn't we side with the Eighth Route Army?"

　　When Chiang Kai-shek's American planes began strafing Jiaozuo with American machine guns, the workers had only one plan: not to work for them again, but to fight them effectively. In addition to the existing mine guards, a large number of picket team members emerged. They shouldered rifles and machine guns, cursing and mocking the enemy planes: "Scare yourselves! Only you fat pigs are afraid of death!"

　　Their first thought was for the machines. "The machines are ours; we won't let the enemy use a single one."

　　With the picket team providing armed cover, the workers began to transfer the machines with all their might. When there weren't enough carts and livestock, they carried them on their shoulders. Technical workers, technical staff, the elderly, and even barbers all automatically participated in the transportation.

　　Enemy planes constantly tracked and strafed, and the boilers of the machines were riddled with holes. The workers would inspect them, say, "It doesn't matter!" smile contentedly, and quicken their pace towards the designated location. They completely forgot that they existed outside of the machines.

　　The night before the enemy invaded Jiaozuo (the night of the 11th), the artillery fire was very intense, but not a single worker showed weakness or retreated. They insisted on moving all the machines they could that night. It was raining, and the rugged mountain paths were covered in mud. Many of the workers had never walked mountain roads before, and on top of six or seven days of continuous labor… none of this could affect their tenacious fighting spirit. Without looking back or resting, they carried the heavy machines to a safe area.

　　Machines that couldn't be moved couldn't be allowed to be used by the enemy! The prime mover on the generator was dismantled, the iron bolts on the high-rise crane's cylinder were pulled off, and the pumps underground and above ground were all lowered. Electricity couldn't be generated, and water couldn't be pumped. The workers knew that floodwaters would soon spread throughout the mine, submerging all the mineral deposits and leaving the enemy with nothing. The workers knew that the enemy would absolutely not be able to reconfigure these vital machine parts, because they were all parts manufactured by British machines long ago and could no longer be reproduced.

　　The next day, the enemy invaded the south factory and Jiaozuo. American-made shells began to bombard the north factory, and planes dropped incendiary bombs, starting fires. The workers were still persisting in loading the last batch of machines at the north factory. The picket team unwaveringly monitored the enemy on the ground. They vowed to "act like veteran Red Army soldiers," and they finally covered the workers as they transported this batch of machines to a safer area. Gasping for breath, they touched the thirty-horsepower small generator and lovingly cursed, "You almost killed us!"

　　At the same time as the machines were being moved, the workers' families were also evacuated, which did not affect the machine transportation. The families used their legs and shoulders instead of carts and livestock, leaving the latter for the machines. Supporting the old and carrying the young, they walked up the rugged and muddy mountain slopes without a single complaint. The wife of technical staff member Song Yanliang couldn't walk due to serious illness. Song only left her some food and then carried the machine away. She said, "It doesn't matter if I suffer for a few days here; you have the Eighth Route Army, and you'll be back anyway!"

　　The day after the enemy occupied Jiaozuo, the workers were still busy in the mountains, transporting the machines to ×× County to build a temporary mining factory. The enemy advanced north again, and hidden traitors in Wangfeng also opened fire in coordination with the enemy. When the army and militia engaged the enemy at Baimamen, the workers also captured the armed traitors of Wangfeng in a heroic struggle. The military and civilians cooperated and won their first victory: forty or fifty enemies were eliminated.

　　The brave men of the mine guards and worker picket teams, having completed their task of covering the machines, are now happily undergoing short-term tactical training, preparing to quickly return to the vicinity of Jiaozuo, cooperate with the troops south of the Daoqing Railway, hold large areas of rural positions, and turn Jiaozuo into an isolated island in the sea. They will "annihilate the invading enemy in Jiaozuo! Let the enemy come in walking, but they won't be able to leave even if they're carried out!"

### “把侵入焦作的敌人消灭在焦作！”

　　“把侵入焦作的敌人消灭在焦作！”
    而东
    敌人能够活着进来，不能活着出去—焦作的矿工们坚决这样相信。焦作是我们的，焦作的煤矿是我们的。只是为了更快的消灭敌人，我们才暂时撤退。
    这种坚固的信念与对蒋伪的仇恨心，是几十年来、特别是去年八月解放以来的生活经验给与他们的。在这儿做过三辈子工的工人，都会告诉你战前的、鬼子的和八路军的许多事情。“那时候”（他们把战前和鬼子时代统称为那时候），工人们清早上工，谁也不知道晚间还能不能回来。喂猪的豆饼、豆皮，就是工人的粮食。工人们饿得皮包骨头，下了窑上不来的不知多少，过李封桥叫大风吹下去跌死的就不算数。饿急了，偷点煤去卖，被矿警抓住用冷水灌死，这是你不安分、不守法。八路军来了以后这一年，领导工人打倒惠尔功（前矿委会委员长、蒋记特务头子兼大汉奸恶霸），要回旧工资，增加新工资，户户有存粮，人人有地位。“活这一年比以前几十年几百年都强。为啥不跟八路军一势呢？”
    蒋介石的美国飞机开始用美国机枪扫射焦作的时候，工人们只有一个打算，不是重新为他们做工，而是有效地对他们作战。原有的矿卫队以外，大批纠察队员又涌现出来。他们扛起步枪和机枪，向敌机咒骂着、嘲讽着：“吓唬你们自己吧，只有你们这些肥猪才怕死！”
    他们首先想到的是机器。“机器是我们的，一架也不让敌人使用。”
    纠察队荷枪实弹掩护着，工人们开始以全力转运机器。大车和牲口不够用，就用膀子抬。技术工人、技术职员、老年人，甚至剃头的，都无例外的自动参加了运送。
    敌机不断地追踪扫射，机器的锅炉上射了窟窿，工人们察看一下，“不害事！”满意地微笑着，加速脚步向指定地点前进。他们完全忘记了机器之外还有自己。
    敌人侵陷焦作的前一夜（十一日夜），炮火响的很紧，但没有一个工人示弱、退缩。他们坚持着要在这一夜把能搬的机器都搬走。天下着雨，崎岖的山道上满是泥巴，工人们有许多从来没走过山路，再加上连续六七天的劳累…………这些都不能影响他们顽强的斗志。他们不回头、不休息地把沉重的机器搬向安全地带。
    搬不走的机器也不能让敌人使用！发电机上的原动力机拆卸了，高车的汽缸上的铁活拴拉掉了，井下的水泵与井上的水泵都下了，电不能发了，水也上不来了。工人们知道；大水将很快漫遍矿井，淹没所有的矿藏，使敌人毫无所得。工人们知道，这些被下了的生死攸关的机器零件，敌人是绝对无法配置的，因为那都是老早以前英国机器制造的零件，现在已无法再造。
    第二天，敌人侵入南厂，侵入焦作，美国造的炮弹开始向北厂轰击，飞机扔下了燃烧弹，火烧起来了，工人们仍在坚持着北厂最后一批机器的装运。纠察队毫不动摇地监视着地面上的敌人，他们发誓“要像个老红军的样子”，他们终于掩护着工人们把这批机器运抵较安全地带。他们喘着气，摸摸那三十马力的小发电机，爱抚地骂：“你可把老子们累死啦！”
    与搬运机器同时，工人们的家属也都转移了出去，这并未影响机器搬运。家属们用双腿双肩代替大车与牲口，而把后者让给机器。他们扶老携幼，走上崎岖泥泞的山坡，没有一句怨言。技术职员宋言良的妻子因病重不能走，宋只留给她一些粮食，就抬着机器走了。她说：“我在这儿受几天罪不要紧，你们有八路军，反正要回来的！”
    敌陷焦作的第二天，工人们仍在山里奔忙着，他们要把机器运到××县去建设临时地矿厂。敌人又向北进犯了，王封一带暗藏的奸细也配合敌人开了枪，当军队和民兵在白马门与敌接火的时候，工人们也以英勇的搏战把王封的武装奸细活捉了回来。军民合作他们打了第一个胜仗：四五十个敌人被消灭了。
    解除了掩护机器任务的矿卫队与工人纠察队的勇士们，现在正愉快地进行短期战术训练，准备很快返回焦作近郊，配合道清路南的军队，坚持大片乡村阵地，把焦作变成大海中的孤岛。他们要“把侵入焦作的敌人消灭在焦作！让敌人走进着来，抬着也出不去！”
