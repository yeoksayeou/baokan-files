　　Taiyue Holds "Demand U.S. Troops Withdraw" Week
　　Teachers and Students of Various Schools Go Out to Publicize
　　[Taiyue, 25th dispatch] During the first and second days of the Taiyue District's "Demand U.S. Troops Withdraw from China" campaign week, various schools held activity days, and the campaign began to unfold universally and deeply. In Yangcheng, all teachers and students from eight schools, including Jinan Middle School, went to villages 30 miles away from the city to carry out costumed publicity for "Demanding U.S. Troops Withdraw, Stop Aiding Chiang in the Civil War." On the 11th, there was a Xigou and Guohe second-hand clothing fair in Yangcheng's first district, where merchants from all directions gathered, and there were over 10,000 people. Yangcheng's First High School rushed to publicize, creating eye-catching and colorful flying wall posters and cartoons, which were exceptionally lively. The square play performed by students from Yangyi and Xigou villages featured characters dressed as Americans, Chiang Kai-shek, ordinary people... vividly depicting the U.S. aiding Chiang's conspiracy and crimes, which aroused resentment among the audience. In addition, there were district and village cadres, students, and teachers conducting street publicity, surrounded by countless listeners. An old villager said, "This concerns our liberation, so we must listen." During the publicity process, the slogan "Demand U.S. Troops Withdraw" echoed through the mountains. Jincheng Second High School, in the movement, strengthened the education of students' personality and integrity. Principal Guo proposed the "Five No's Movement": (1) Don't be afraid, (2) Don't panic, (3) Don't separate from school organization, (4) Don't participate in anti-people organizations, (5) Don't tell the truth to Chiang's special agents and Chiang's army. The Taiyue Administrative Office Cadre School is intensively engaged in a week of intensive current affairs study, studying current affairs for five hours every day, and will hold a general student meeting on the 26th to hold a debate on current affairs.
