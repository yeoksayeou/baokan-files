Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 6th: According to Hong Kong news from various news agencies: On October 26th, the largest disturbance since 1920 occurred in Kowloon, Hong Kong. The cause was a foreign policeman in Kowloon kicking and killing a Chinese peanut vendor named Huang Shui-ri, which aroused public anger among the Chinese. At the time, a group of Chinese surrounded the body and refused to allow the police to move it. Subsequently, police cars brought in military police reinforcements, and the crowd fought the military police with stones. Later, the fire brigade dispersed the crowd with water cannons. The conflict re-escalated at 9 p.m. On the Hong Kong side, people also marched that evening to protest the police's brutality. The police fired shots to disperse the crowd. Seven people were injured and more than 20 people were arrested in the conflict that day. On the 27th, military police patrolled the streets of Hong Kong and Kowloon fully armed, but failed to prevent the continuation of the conflict. On the 28th, in order to prevent the situation from escalating, the Hong Kong and Kowloon authorities allowed a public funeral for the deceased hawker and a trial of the murderer. On the day of the funeral, thousands of people attended the funeral procession, and traffic on the main streets of Kowloon was blocked by the funeral procession for two hours. On the same day, the offending policeman, Said, was charged with murder in the Kowloon court. Three thousand people crowded into the heavily guarded halls and side halls. The arrested Chinese were released after being detained for several days.
