The Struggle Is Not Yet Over!
    Tian Zong
    At the heroes' meeting of land reform in Qin County, old man He Hailong swore, "The struggle is not over! As long as I live, I will fight the landlords and special agents!" Tears streamed down his face as he spoke, his heart tempered by suffering into something as hard as iron.
    During the anti-Japanese period, He Hailong's hometown, Tang Village, was surrounded on three sides by villages that "maintained" the enemy, but it still persisted in its struggle. The enemy used the strength of three strongholds to attack it nine times in half a month, but it was not intimidated. Later, the Three People's Principles Youth League in the village secretly colluded with the enemy, attempting to extinguish the flames of resistance in Tang Village from within, and the situation became even more serious. But the excellent people of Tang Village still stood firm. People worked in the village during the day, and slept outside the village at night. In order to avoid the surveillance of these members of the Three People's Principles Youth League, they sometimes slept in one place for a night, got up to pee, and then moved to another place. They slept in the wild, surrounded by a circle of hand grenades, and never relaxed their vigilance even when it snowed and the wind blew. But the members of the Three People's Principles Youth League followed them like ghosts. On the morning of October 22nd of the thirty-fifth year of the Republic of China, He Baochang, the branch secretary, He Hailong's eldest son, was coming out of a secret cave in Yangjiagou when he saw Wen Jiayuan, a member of the Three People's Principles Youth League, pretending to be getting manure and walking past the entrance suspiciously. He was startled and did not come again that night. Coincidentally, his younger brother Erbao (executive committee member of the district peasant association), village office secretary Li Tianchen, and several other young people came to sleep here because it was quiet. They had only been asleep for half the night when Zhang Hehai and Li Linku, members of the Three People's Principles Youth League, led the enemy. They first threw a hand grenade into the cave, blowing off the foot of Li Tianchen, which was sticking out of the cave. People screamed and jumped up, completely panicked. There were no guns or other weapons, and except for a door, there were walls on all sides. So He Erbao rushed out the door first. The enemy grabbed him in the chest and asked, "Who are you!" Zhang Hehai walked over and laughed, "Haha, it's Erbao. We couldn't catch his brother, so he'll do." He ordered the enemy to tie him up, beat his chest with a gun butt until it was swollen, and stabbed his back with a bayonet before kicking him away. Then they went into the cave and saw Li Tianchen lying on the ground, gasping for breath. They covered him with the straw they had been sleeping on and set it on fire, burning him to death. At dawn, He Hailong heard the news and rushed to Yangjiagou. Erbao was also covered in blood. He was carried home, where he only rolled his eyes and weakly said, "The special agents Zhang Hehai and Li Linku killed me. You must avenge me!" Then he died. These words were buried in He Hailong's heart, like a bullet that had not been removed, wrapped in a healed wound, causing pain from time to time.
    After the Japanese surrendered, Yan Xishan incorporated the Japanese and puppet troops in Qin County and carried out doubled massacres of the people. The reactionary landlords of Tang Village, Wen Wusheng and Wen Shuisheng, also fled to the city at this time to become Yan's henchmen, and the people of Tang Village suffered even greater disasters. They were attacked twenty-eight times in one month, and He Hailong, because of his son, was hunted down four times in ten days in April of this year. The grain in his house was looted, the pots, bowls, cups, and plates were smashed, and in the last instance, his wife was also arrested. The reactionaries even used a hoe to clamp and pound the feet of such an old woman, and hung her up. It cost 300 kilograms of millet to redeem her. From then on, He Hailong had to abandon his hometown and flee to the area of ​​Guxian Town. Soon, his eldest son, He Baochang, also died of overwork because he persisted in such a severe struggle. Thus, this sixty-two-year-old man contributed his two sons to the cause of the motherland and the people, and his hatred for the enemy and the reactionaries accumulated even more heavily.
    After Qin County was liberated, the people of Tang Village held a memorial service for the twenty-seven martyrs who had heroically sacrificed themselves, and at this meeting, they conducted a trial of Zhang Hehai, a traitorous murderer and member of the Three People's Principles Youth League. On this day, He Hailong became very young and strong. His grief and his flames of revenge excited him. He cried for a while, and then held back his tears, asking Zhang Hehai: "Zhang Hehai, listen to me, what hatred do I have with you?" He said: "None." He asked again: "What hatred does Erbao have with you?" He said again: "None!" "None? Why did you kill him!" He suddenly roared and walked over, clenching his fists at Zhang. Zhang Hehai hurriedly said: "No, I originally wanted to kill Baochang!" The old man roared, and his family, his wife, daughters, and daughters-in-law, also roared, surrounding Zhang Hehai and beating him severely. After a while, he stopped them and asked him, "Zhang Hehai, who told you to kill him?" He said, "Wen Wusheng," and asked, "Wen Wusheng told you to kill him, what bribes did you receive from him?" He said: "He gave me a斗 of wheat, a斗 of beans, two斗 of millet, and ten yuan." He Hailong's eyes suddenly brightened. He saw how the landlords, murderers, and members of the Three People's Principles Youth League colluded and hated the people. He couldn't help but cry, grabbing Zhang Hehai and shouting: "Zhang Hehai, are you still human! Now I'll give you twenty石 of grain, you go kill Wen Wusheng for me!" At this time, the wife of Li Tianchen, who was burned to death, and the wife of Huang Mankun, who was persecuted, also squeezed in to accuse him. The people of Tang Village were filled with righteous indignation, and the fire burned higher and higher - and so this murderer was executed by the masses.
    He Hailong fulfilled his son's dying request and avenged his blood feud. Later, in several grievance-airing and liquidation meetings, he was also given more than ten acres of land, three rooms, and half a donkey, so that he could rebuild his shattered family property. He put his heart at ease. But on the other hand, under the suppression of the people's forces, the landlords and reactionaries' attacks were still being carried out secretly. Just one and a half months after Zhang Hehai was punished, He Hailong finished harvesting the autumn crops and piled all the straw in the square at the door, but one night it was burned by reactionary fellows. When he woke up from his sleep and ran out to see it, it was all burned. This fire gave He Hailong an inspiration:
  "The struggle with the landlords and reactionaries is serious and long-term."
    So this time when the whole county held a heroes' meeting of land reform, he also brought his youngest son - Sanbao. He told people: "I brought him here to tell you all that when I die in the future, he can follow you and fight the reactionaries!"

　　斗争还没有完结！
    天纵
    赫海龙老汉在沁县翻身英雄大会上发着誓说：“斗争还没有完结，活一天还要和地主特务斗争一天。”在他讲话的时候，满脸爬着泪珠，他的心被痛苦磨练得像铁一般坚实。
    在抗日时期，赫海龙的家乡唐村，三面围绕着的村庄都“维持”了敌人，它仍坚持着斗争，以致敌人用了三个据点的兵力，半月向它进攻九次，也没有把它吓倒。后来村里的三青团秘密勾结了敌人，企图从内部来扑灭唐村抗日的火焰，局面就变得更加严重了。但优秀的唐村人民仍然屹立着。人们白天在村里工作，夜里便到村外去睡，为了躲避这些三青团员的监视，他们有时在一个地方睡过一觉，爬起来撒泡尿又转个地方，他们在野地里睡觉，周围安下一圈手榴弹，虽是下雪刮风，也没有一次放松戒备。可是三青团员像鬼魅一般的跟着他们。民国三十五年十月二十二日的一天清早，赫海龙的大儿子——分委书记赫宝成正从杨家沟一个秘密的窑洞里出来，便看见三青团员温甲元装作拿粪的样子，在门口鬼鬼崇崇地走过去了。他吓了一跳，夜里便不再来了。凑巧他的弟弟二宝（区农会的执委）村公所书记李天臣、和另外几个青年见这里僻静，却来睡了，才睡到半夜，三青团员张和孩、李林库便引上敌人来了，他们先朝窑洞打进去一颗手榴弹，把李天臣伸出坑外的那只脚炸烂了。人们一阵惊叫，跳起来，完全慌乱了，没有枪，也没有别的武器，除了一个门以外，四面都是墙，于是赫二宝就先向门口冲出来，敌人当胸把他揪住，问道：“你是谁！”张和孩走过来一看笑道：“哈哈，是二宝，他哥抓不住，就他也算。”便叫敌人把他捆起来，用枪托把胸脯打肿了，又用刺刀把背膊扎烂了，才把他踢开，又到窑洞里见李天臣倒在地上，张着口吐气，便把他们铺着睡觉的谷草盖在他身上，点火烧死了。天一亮，赫海龙听得这个消息，赶到杨家沟，二宝也成个血人了，抬回家只翻了翻眼，微弱地说着：“杀我的是特务张和孩和李林库，你要替我报仇呀！”他便死了，这话埋在赫海龙心中，像一粒没有取出的子弹包在痊愈了的伤口里面，时时作痛。
    日寇投降以后，阎锡山收编了沁县的日伪军，对人民进行着加倍的屠杀。唐村的反动地主温吾生、温水生也于此时逃进城内为阎伪羽翼，唐村人民便遭到更大的灾难，一个月曾被进攻过二十八次，而赫海龙因其儿子之故，今年四月十天之间也被追捕过四次，把他家里的粮抢光了，锅碗杯盘打碎了，最后一次把他的老婆也逮捕了。反动派对于这样一个老妇人还用镢头夹捣她的脚，把她吊起来，花了三百斤小米，才把人赎回来。从此赫海龙只得抛了家乡，到故县镇一带去逃难了。不久，他的大儿子赫宝成也因坚持如此严重的斗争，积劳而死了。于是这个六十二岁的老人便为了祖国，为了人民的事业，贡献出他两个儿子，他对敌人、对反动派的仇恨也积累得更加沉重起来了。
    沁县解放以后，唐村的人民曾为他们英勇牺牲了的二十七位烈士开了个追悼会，并在这个大会上进行对汉奸杀人犯三青团员张和孩的审判，这天赫海龙变得非常年青和健壮了，他的悲愤、他的复仇火焰使他激动着，他一会哭着，一会又忍住泪，问着张和孩：“张和孩，你听我说，我和你有什么仇？”他说：“没有。”又问：“二宝和你有什么仇？”他又说：“没有！”“没有、你为什么要杀他呀！”他突然吼叫走来，向张握紧拳头，张和孩忙说：“不是啦，原先我是想杀宝成哩！”老汉吼着，他的一家，他的老婆、闺女、媳妇、也吼叫着。把张和孩包围起来痛打，一会他把人喝住了，又问他“张和孩，你说是谁叫你杀的呀？”他说：“温吾生，”又问：“是温吾生叫你杀的，你受了他什么贿赂？”他说：“他给我一斗麦、一斗豆、二斗小米、和十块钱。”赫海龙的眼睛突然明亮了，他看见了地主杀人犯、三青团员是如何勾结着，如何仇视着人民，他不禁哭起来，拉住张和孩喊着：“张和孩，你还算人么！现在我给你二十石粮食，你给我去把温吾生杀了！”这时被烧死的李天臣的老婆、被迫害过的黄满库的老婆也挤进来控诉，全唐村人民众愤火越燃越高了，——于是这个杀人犯被群众处死了。
    赫海龙实现了他儿子临终的要求，把仇昭雪了。以后在几次诉苦清算中，又分得了十多亩地，三间房，半头驴，得以把破碎的家产建设起来。也就把心放下了。可是在另一方面，在人民力量的镇压之下，地主反动派的进攻仍在秘密进行着，刚刚在惩办了张和孩以后的一个半月，赫海龙收罢秋，把所有的谷草都堆在门口的广场上，谁知却在一个夜里便被反动家伙们烧掉了，当他从睡梦中惊醒过来，跑出来一看烧完了。这火给赫海龙一个启示：
  “和地主反动派的斗争是严重和长期的。”
    所以这次全县开翻身英雄大会时，他把他最后的一个儿子——三宝也带来了，他告诉人说：“我带他来，告诉你们大家，将来我死了他也可以跟着你们和反动派斗争呀！”
