　　People from all walks of life in Southern Hebei actively donate money.
    Yongzhi and Guanxian Counties donate more than 3 million yuan in one week.
    [Our newspaper Weixian, 28th] In order to practically respond to the "US troops withdraw from China movement" and defeat the joint offensive of Chiang and the US, cadres and staff of party, government, military and civilian organizations at all levels in Southern Hebei, as well as the emancipated peasants, store managers and shop assistants, and even the wounded and sick soldiers of the Eighth Route Army, have tried their best to save their winter clothes, vegetable money, and health care expenses to send to the front to comfort the loyal and brave soldiers. In one week, Yongzhi and Guanxian counties collected a total of 3,673,760 yuan in donations, 9,737 jin of rice, 2,200 jin of pears, two pigs, and 168 jin of snacks. There were also many other items such as noodles, cigarettes, chickens, and eggs. All the faculty and students of the Wuxun Normal School donated all 100,000 yuan of their production savings for the past ten months to the soldiers on the front line. The primary school students of the affiliated primary school also took out all 1,070 yuan they earned from growing vegetables as a consolation donation. The school also decided that each person would eat two taels less rice per day for the next three months of the year to save food for donation. In one hour, the Guanxian County Teacher Training Class donated 200,5350 yuan. Cao Yucheng, a new soldier who had just joined a logistics department in the Seventh Military Subdistrict, also donated the 820 yuan he had just received for shoe expenses and subsidies, as well as a new towel. Xu Longzheng, the instructor of the department, was ill, but he insisted on donating all 750 yuan of his ten-day sick leave food allowance to comfort the brave warriors on the front line; Li Zigao, the section chief who was recovering from his injuries in the same place, sent his two-month subsidy and health care expenses to the front. Store managers and shop assistants in Linqing City donated a total of 374,440 yuan. Guo Yichen, who is over fifty years old, wholeheartedly requested to go to the front line. After many dissuasions, he said: "I don't want the cotton clothes I will receive in the winter. I want to share the joys and sorrows with the soldiers on the front line."
