Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd: Nanjing Dispatch: Chiang Kai-shek recently demanded that the CCP and the Third Force immediately submit a list of National Assembly representatives to participate in the Kuomintang's one-party convened "National Assembly" on November 12, which violates the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. Chiang also stated that if the other party does not accept this request, he will continue to wage an all-out war. Mei Yi, spokesperson for the CCP delegation in Nanjing, issued a statement on the 30th, sternly rejecting this. According to a United Press Nanjing dispatch on the 1st, the Third Force's peace efforts have completely failed due to the Kuomintang government's insistence on convening the National Assembly. The CCP and the Third Force refused to submit a list for the "National Assembly" on the grounds that it is inconsistent with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference.

　　蒋介石用“大打”威胁
    强迫参加非法国大
    中共及第三方面严正拒绝
    【新华社延安二日电】南京讯：蒋介石近要求中共及第三方面立即提出国大代表名单，参加破坏政协决议的由国民党一党召开的十一月十二日“国民大会”。蒋并表示如对方不接受此种要求，他就继续大打。南京中共代表团发言人梅益，对此特于三十日发表谈话，予以严正拒绝。另据合众社南京一日电，在国民党政府坚持召开国大之下，第三方面之和平努力已告完全失败，中共与第三方面拒绝提出“国大”名单，理由是与政协决议不合。
