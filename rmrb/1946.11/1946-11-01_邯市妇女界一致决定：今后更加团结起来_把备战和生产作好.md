　　[Report from our newspaper in Handan] Women from all walks of life in the city responded to the movement for the withdrawal of American troops from China and held a symposium on the 24th of this month. Despite three enemy air raids and threats, the women representatives who came to participate were very enthusiastic. Comrade Cheng Shilan, the chairman, announced the opening of the meeting and reported the significance of convening the symposium. Most of the subsequent speakers were representatives of the liberated. The representative from Peace Avenue said: "Chairman Mao led us to liberation, and we must not let the bullies and landlords bully us again. We can only deal with them by stepping up war preparedness. The old people and children in our village have been evacuated. Those with relatives go to their relatives, and those without relatives help each other to find ways to evacuate. Now there are only ten or so families left doing small businesses. They say that when the enemy comes, they will leave with their pots and chopsticks." The representative from Ximenli said: "I heard that breakfast in Beiping costs 500 yuan a meal. American-made breakfast is better than ours, and it only costs 300 yuan to eat your fill, which has ruined the small businesses in Beiping. My family makes a living by selling goat's milk and knitting sweaters. If American goods come here, I won't be able to survive, so I have to fight with Old Chiang!" Other representatives also scrambled to express their resentment towards the United States for helping Chiang Kai-shek fight the civil war. Comrade Zhu Lian from the Health Bureau pointed out: "The U.S.-Chiang alliance fighting the civil war is most painful for women and children. Women should unite even more closely and step up war preparedness and production in order to speed up the defeat of the enemy." In the tense and angry atmosphere, Comrade Song Weijing summarized everyone's opinions and explained that we are powerful, and asked the representatives to go home and tell the sisters who did not attend the meeting the significance of today's symposium, and to unite more closely in the future to protect the fruits of liberation. Finally, they unanimously expressed their protest against the U.S. military's presence in China and demanded that the U.S. military withdraw from China immediately.

　　邯市妇女界一致决定：今后更加团结起来
    把备战和生产作好
    【本报邯郸讯】本市各界妇女响应美军退出中国运动，于本月二十四日召开座谈会，虽在敌机三次袭扰和威胁下，来参加的妇女代表仍然非常踊跃。主席程式兰同志宣布开会，并报告召集座谈会的意义后，接着发言的大多数是翻身代表。和平大街的代表说：“毛主席领导咱翻了身，可不能再让恶霸地主来欺负咱，咱只有以加紧备战来对付他，俺村的老人、小孩都疏散了，有亲的投亲，没有的就互相帮助，设法疏散，现在只剩十来家做小生意的，他们说敌人来了，背着锅筷就走。”西门里的代表说：“听说北平的早点要五百元一顿，美国货的早点比咱好，只要三百元就可以吃饱，把北平那些做小生意的都弄垮了，俺家是卖羊奶和打毛衣过活的，如果美国货来这里，俺就不行了，所以非和老蒋拚不行！”其他的代表亦莫不争先恐后的说出她们对美国帮助蒋介石打内战的愤恨。卫生局的朱琏同志指出：“美蒋联合打内战，最受痛苦的是妇女和小孩，妇女们更应该团结起来，加紧备战和生产，才能加快的打垮敌人。”在紧张愤激的空气中，宋维静同志总结了大家的意见，并说明我们是有力量的，要代表们回家把今天座谈会的意义讲给未参加会的姊妹们听，今后更加团结起来，保护翻身果实。最后一致表示抗议美军驻华，要求美军马上撤出中国去。
