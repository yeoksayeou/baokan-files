    Taihang First and Second Special Districts Decide to Build Large Stations
    Develop Winter Transport
    [Our newspaper, Changzhi News] The Construction Sections of the First and Second Special Districts, the Jixi Cooperative Head Office, the Jindong Cooperative Head Office, and the county cooperative associations of Yuanshi, Zanhuang, Xingtai, Heshun, Zuoquan, and other counties held a joint meeting in Dongye Town, Xiyang, last month to specifically discuss how to develop commercial transportation, production, and the exchange of materials between Jindong and Jixi in winter. The meeting lasted for three days and decided to build four east-west cart roads to connect traffic between the mountains and plains. The first route is from Pingding East to Yuanshi, the second from Dongye Town, Xiyang, to Zanhuang, the third from Heshun to Xingtai, and the fourth from Zuoquan to Songjiazhuang in Xingtai. All are to be completed before November 15. Each county is responsible for mobilizing the masses along the routes to rush the repairs. The section of the road from Dongye Town, Xiyang, to Zanhuang that passes through Huangshayug requires stonework, for which the two special districts will jointly allocate 600 shi of millet to hire labor to assist in the repairs. Cotton from the mountains of Jixi is essential for developing textiles in Jindong, and coal from Jindong is also necessary for the plains. The completion of these four roads will reduce transportation costs and facilitate the exchange of materials in winter. To this end, it was also decided to plan and establish stations and shops along the routes to facilitate merchants and travelers. These kinds of shops and stations will be based on the principle of public assistance and private operation, mobilizing the people to operate them. The shops and stations will not only provide cheap food and lodging but also buy or sell goods on consignment, and find return journeys for porters. Efforts will be made to minimize the stay of merchants and travelers outside and reduce their travel expenses. This will not only make it easier for the people to profit but also lower market prices and absorb the temporary labor of livestock along the routes for short-distance transportation.

    太行一二专署决修大车站
    发展冬季运输
    【本报长治讯】一、二两专署建设科，冀西合作总社，晋东合作总社，及元氏、赞皇、邢台、和顺、左权等县县联社，于上月中在昔阳东冶头镇召开联席会议，具体商讨如何发展晋东与冀西冬季的商业运输生产与交流两地物资问题。会议历时三天，决定修通东西大车路四条，以沟通山上山下交通。第一条由平（定）东通元氏，第二条由昔阳东冶头通赞皇，第三条由和顺通邢台，第四条由左权通邢台之宋家庄。均限于十一月十五日前完成。由各县负责发动沿路群众赶修。昔阳东冶头至赞皇一条，途中经黄沙峪一段需用石工，由两专署共拨小米六百石，雇工助修。冀西山下产棉，为晋东发展纺织不可少，晋东之煤亦为山下所必需。此四路修通，今冬运输生产，可减低运费，交流物资。为此，并决定沿路有计划地设站与店，便利商旅。此种店站以民办公助为原则，发动人民经营，店站不仅供便宜之食宿，并可收买或代卖货物，代脚户找来回脚等。尽力使商旅与脚户在外少停，减低其盘川费用。如此不仅使人民易于获利，并可使市场物价降低，吸收沿路群众牲畜等临时劳动力，作短距离的运输。（王力行）
