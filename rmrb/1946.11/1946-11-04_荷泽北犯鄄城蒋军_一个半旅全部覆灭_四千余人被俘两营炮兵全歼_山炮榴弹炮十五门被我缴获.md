[Urgent Dispatch from the Jilu豫 Front, November 2nd] Following the annihilation of more than 5,000 Chiang Kai-shek troops at Longji on the Heze-Jining Highway in mid-October, the ever-victorious People's Army under General Liu Bocheng has once again annihilated one and a half brigades and two artillery battalions of Chiang Kai-shek's troops north of Heze, creating another glorious victory in the overall resistance. The entire 119th Brigade (formerly a division) of the 68th Division (formerly an army), the remaining one regiment of the 29th Brigade (formerly a division) of the 55th Division (formerly an army), the artillery battalion of the 68th Division, and the First Battalion (howitzer battalion) of the 10th Artillery Regiment attached by the Ministry of National Defense, a total of three regiments and two artillery battalions, advanced north from Heze along the Heze-Juancheng Highway on the 27th, attempting to coordinate with the 5th Army and the Remnant 11th Division advancing north along the Juancheng-Yucheng Highway. In order to annihilate the enemy, the Eighth Route Army under General Liu Bocheng lured them deep. When they advanced to the area of Gaokui Village, Fuchun, Renzhuang, Liujia Village, Fanzhuang, and Sutun, ten miles south of Juancheng, they were surrounded from the evening of the 29th and fiercely fought until the evening of the 31st, completely annihilating the invading army. According to preliminary statistics, more than 4,000 people were captured alive, and seven complete mountain guns, eight howitzers, and more than 20 vehicles were seized. Other guns, ammunition, and supplies are still being inventoried. While the annihilation battle was in progress, the 241st Regiment of the 81st Brigade, a remnant of the 68th Division, hurriedly went north from Heze to reinforce, but was partially annihilated near Baiyiji and retreated south, and is now being forced to be annihilated. At the same time, the remnant troops of the Fifth Army and the 11th Division, which came to reinforce from the Yucheng-Juancheng line, were blocked east of Juancheng and were unable to advance.
