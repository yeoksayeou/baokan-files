　　Minefields Scare the Yan-Puppet Troops Out of Their Wits; Yuci Militia Recovers Changning
　　[This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch of the 14th] In order to penetrate our liberated areas and seize grain, the Yan puppet troops in Yuci occupied Changning town and villages such as Fengtai, Dongxizi, and Hezhuangzi on the 26th and 28th of last month. The local militia immediately launched a fierce siege and mine warfare to combat their grain-grabbing conspiracy. The Yan puppet troops, unable to withstand the pressure, fled back to Yuci city on the 8th of this month, and the aforementioned towns and villages were recovered. When the Yan puppet troops invaded Changning on the 27th, a total of ten landmines were detonated in the town, killing and wounding more than ten Yan stubborn troops. On the 31st, more than 100 Yan puppet troops occupying Changning divided into two groups to harass Xiangli village. The village militia laid a minefield with 75 landmines, then covered the withdrawal of the masses, luring the enemy into the minefield, and harassing them from the flanks with pot shots. The Yan puppet troops were panicked and disoriented, triggering many landmines, and the machine gunner was also killed. In this battle, a total of four Yan puppet troops were killed and seven were wounded. In total, in October, the county's militia detonated 28 landmines, killing and wounding 39 enemies.
　　[This newspaper's special dispatch] On the 10th of this month, a unit of Yan puppet troops from Qicheng Village in Qixian County sneaked into the Nanda Han Village area of Qixian County to plunder. They were ambushed by our local armed forces, and the Yan puppet troops collapsed and fled. Five Yan puppet troops were killed or wounded, and five were captured alive. Four rifles and some ammunition were seized. (Zhengming)
　　[This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch of the 14th] In southern Shanxi, under the powerful attacks of our guerrilla corps, the Kuomintang troops' morale for war is declining day by day. Should they be cannon fodder? Should they be captured? Or should they desert? The discussion of these questions has spread among all the soldiers. The Kuomintang's New Fourth Brigade (reorganized from the remnants of the original 31st Brigade) and the 92nd Division, since invading Xiaxian Zhuanguo on October 21, have used two-thirds of their forces for defense and construction of fortifications due to frequent attacks by our guerrillas. Only one-third of the troops were used for guard duty. The soldiers were extremely fearful. In the past five days, as many as 63 Kuomintang soldiers, weary of war, have deserted to our liberated areas.

    【本报长治十四日电】榆次阎伪为深入我解放区抢粮，于上月二十六日与二十八日先后侵占我长凝镇及丰台、东西子、河庄子等村镇。当地民兵即展开猛烈围困战与地雷战，打击其抢粮阴谋，阎伪不支，于本月八日分别向榆次城逃去，上述村镇又告恢复。二十七日阎伪犯长凝时，在该镇共踏响地雷十个，炸死伤阎顽军十余人。三十一日，侵据长凝阎伪百余人，又分两路向相立村出扰，该村民兵以七十五颗地雷摆下地雷阵后，即掩护群众撤出，诱敌进入雷阵，并自侧翼以冷枪袭扰，阎伪军心慌意乱，触发地雷甚多，机枪射手亦被炸死。是役计共炸死阎伪军四人，炸伤七人。总计十月份，该县民兵共炸响地雷二十八个，炸死伤敌三十九名。

    【本报太岳十四日电】晋南蒋军在我游击兵团的有力打击下，厌战逃亡之风日炽，当炮灰呢？被俘呢？还是开小差？对于这些问题的谈论，已遍及所有士兵中，蒋军新四旅（原三十一旅残部改编）及九十二师，自十月二十一日侵入夏县专郭后，因经常遭到我游击队袭击，已把兵力三分之二用作守备和修筑工事，只有三分之一的兵力用作警戒，士兵恐惧不堪，近五天内厌战逃来我解放区的蒋军士兵，已达六十三名。
