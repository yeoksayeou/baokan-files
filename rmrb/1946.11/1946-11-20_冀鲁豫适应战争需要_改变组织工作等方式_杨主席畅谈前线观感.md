    Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Adapts to the Needs of War
    Changes are Made to Organizational Work Methods, etc.
    Chairman Yang Discusses Observations from the Front Lines

    [Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] On the afternoon of the 14th, regarding the question of how the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region adapts to the needs of the war and changes various organizational forms and ways of working and living, this reporter visited Chairman Yang Xiufeng, who had just returned from consoling the troops at the front. Chairman Yang said: The Hebei-Shandong-Henan region has experienced particularly heavy rainfall this year, making troop movements extremely difficult, but the military and civilians of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region have annihilated 55,000 of Chiang Kai-shek's troops in three months of self-defense warfare.

    "What is particularly exciting," Chairman Yang said, "is that the ever-victorious elite soldiers of General Liu Bocheng's troops still do not forget to help the masses harvest and cultivate during frequent warfare. From the 18th to the 21st of last month, I happened to be at the front line and witnessed many fields filled with self-defense soldiers, simultaneously rushing to harvest autumn grain and rushing to plant wheat. The soldiers' singing and the animals' neighing blended together. The militia also seized the gaps in the war to return to their villages for a concentrated harvest, and most of the autumn grain was rushed to be harvested and the wheat was all planted within ten days. In order to save civilian labor, starting from the Zhangfengji battle, all cadres from senior commanders down carried as many hand grenades as possible when departing, which saved a large amount of civilian labor."

    Chairman Yang said: The field hospitals at the front have achieved great results. New treatment methods are widely used. According to statistics for September and October, cadres and soldiers who recovered and returned to the front accounted for 70 percent of the number of people treated. Bullet wounds used to take a month to heal, but now they are guaranteed to heal within two weeks, and the recovery period for fractures is twice as fast as in the past. The food has also been greatly improved, with an average nutritional value of 70 kilolins (the same as the nutrition for Japanese wounded soldiers, 20 kilolins more than in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region in the past, and 40 kilolins more than in the Taihang region in the past), which the wounded are extremely satisfied with.

    The logistics work has also completed its tasks. Before annihilating the reorganized Third Division, due to a lack of scientific management, there was a great waste of manpower. The military and political leading organs and the front-line troops immediately paid close attention to this. Now, each unit uses civilian labor only after precise calculations and with dedicated personnel for inspection. Every effort is made to care for the stretchers and porters. Most of the stretcher teams are led by responsible cadres such as county magistrates and county secretaries. In an intense battle like Zhangfengji, very few stretcher teams were scattered, and one unit's stretcher team suffered no casualties. After collective research, a new type of stretcher was designed, reducing the number of people needed from nine to five, greatly saving civilian labor.

    Regarding changes in organizational forms, Chairman Yang said: Hebei-Shandong-Henan organizations at all levels have implemented unified leadership in Chiang-occupied areas and areas close to the battlefields, and have generally established armed work teams. In general areas, administrative institutions have also been largely merged, striving for leanness and strength. For example, the Civil (Administration), Education, and Judicial Departments of the Administrative Office are merged into one, and the Financial and Construction Departments are merged into one, and a unified command is formed to support the front lines and battlefield work. A large number of original cadres were drawn from the organs to strengthen the strength of the lower-level counties, districts, and villages. All office miscellaneous expenses and personal allowances of the organs have been cancelled. Now, the transportation work in Hebei-Shandong-Henan has also been reorganized to adapt to the war situation. Military post has been established, and newspapers and mail can be quickly delivered to the front lines. The same journey used to take half a month, but now it only takes six days. When I was at the front command, I could see the People's Daily in six days. It can be seen that if we can adapt to the war and change organizational forms, we can not only persist in our work, but also improve efficiency.

    When the topic turned to the "Land to the Tiller" movement, Chairman Yang said: In the early stages of the war in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region, some places had relaxed the implementation of the "Land to the Tiller" policy, and individual masses in enemy-occupied areas and areas close to the enemy had retreated from the fruits of the struggle. There were also some places where the mobilization of the masses was neglected due to participation in the war, and the fruits of the struggle had not yet been distributed or not properly distributed. This was mainly a problem of insufficient ideological understanding and mass mobilization, but it was quickly corrected. Now the direction is clear, and the movement continues to develop.

    Chairman Yang said: What I observed on the front lines of Hebei-Shandong-Henan fully confirmed Comrade Liu Shaoqi's judgment that Chiang Kai-shek's reserves have been exhausted, and the attack on the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region has reached its peak. We must use practical actions to support the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. He also said: I have visited various field hospitals on the front lines to comfort the wounded soldiers, and I saw that they generally lacked and urgently needed spiritual food. Therefore, Chairman Yang called on the entire region to launch a "cultural consolation movement," even if it is a picture novel. In addition, the military and civilians at the front particularly need medicine, because there are particularly many people who get sick in water operations, but they still do not leave the front line. It is hoped that the people of the entire border region will provide support and comfort. (Zhan Chao)

    冀鲁豫适应战争需要
    改变组织工作等方式
    杨主席畅谈前线观感
    【本报特讯】十四日下午，记者以冀鲁豫区如何适应战争需要，改变各种组织形式及工作、生活方式为题，走访甫自前线劳军归来的杨秀峰主席。杨主席称：冀鲁豫今年雨水特别大，行军运动均极困难，但冀鲁豫军民已在三个月的自卫战争中歼灭蒋军五万五千人。
    “尤其令人兴奋的是，”杨主席说：“刘伯承将军所部常胜军健儿们，在频繁的战争中仍不忘为群众助收助耕。上月十八至二十一日，我正赶到第一线，目睹在许多的原野上布满自卫将士，一面抢收秋粮，一面抢种麦地。将士的歌声与牲畜的嘶叫声连成一片。民兵亦抓紧战争空隙，回村突击收耕，十几天内大部秋粮抢收完毕，麦子已全部种上。为了节省民力，自张凤集战斗开始，自高级指挥员以下全体干部均于出发时，自己尽可能携带手榴弹，结果节省了大批民力。”
    杨主席说：前方野战医院取得了很大成绩。新治疗法广泛的运用。据九、十两个月的统计，伤愈上前线的干部战士占医疗人数百分之七十。子弹伤过要一个月才能好，现在则保证两周内痊愈，骨折伤痊愈期较过去快一倍。伙食也大为改善，养份平均为七十基罗林（与日本伤员营养同，较冀鲁豫过去多二十基罗林，较太行过去多四十基罗林），伤员异常满意。
    兵站工作也同样完成了任务。在歼灭整三师之前，由于缺乏科学管理，人力的浪费大，随即提起军政领导机关以及前线部队之高度注意。现在各部队使用民力先有精确计算，后有专人检查。竭尽心力爱护担架及民夫。大部担架队都由县长、县书等负责干部带领。像张凤集这样激烈的一个战斗，担架队很少走散，某部之担架队没有一个伤亡的。并经集体研究，设计一种新的担架，由需用九人一付减至五人一付，大大的节省了民力。
    关于组织形式的变换，杨主席说：冀鲁豫各级组织在蒋占区及接近战地都实行了一元化领导，普遍成立了武工队，一般地区行政机构亦大部合并，力求精干有力。如行署中民（政）教（育）司（法）三处合而为一，财（政）建（设）两处合而为一，并组成为支援前线与战地工作统一的指挥部。机关大量抽出原有干部，加强下层县区村级力量。所有机关的办公杂支费及个人的津贴费均已取消。现在又如冀鲁豫的交通工作亦已适应战争形势改组，军邮已建立起来，报纸邮件能迅速投到前线。同样的路程，过去需要半月，现在只需六天即可。我在前方司令部时，六天可以看到人民日报。可见我们如能适应战争改变组织形式，不仅能坚持工作，且可提高效能。
    当话题转向“耕者有其田”运动时，杨主席称：冀鲁豫区在战争初期，有些地方曾经放松了贯彻耕者有其田，个别敌后地区及接近敌区的群众曾发生过退斗争果实的现象。也有些地方因为参战忽视了发动群众，斗争果实尚没有或未适当分配，这主要是思想认识与群众发动不够问题，但很快得到纠正。现在方针明确了，运动继续开展起来。
    杨主席称：我在冀鲁豫前线观察所得，完全证实刘少奇同志的论断，蒋军后备已告枯竭，进攻陕甘宁边区已达其进攻的顶点。我们要用实际行动，来支援陕甘宁边区。并称：我在前方曾遍访各野战医院，抚慰伤员，看到他们普遍缺乏而又异常须要精神食粮。因此杨主席号召全区开展一个“文化劳军运动”，那怕是一本图画小说也是好的。此外前方军民特别需要医药，因为水中作战，害病的人特别多，而仍不下前线，望全边区人民有以支援及慰藉。（展潮）
