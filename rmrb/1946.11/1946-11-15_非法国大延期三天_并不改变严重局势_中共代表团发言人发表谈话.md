Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th. Nanjing dispatch: CCP delegation spokesperson, Mei Yi, issued a statement on the 11th regarding the Cai government's announcement of a three-day postponement of the National Assembly. Mei stated: "The CCP does not attach importance to this move by the Kuomintang authorities. This move does not change the current grave situation. Convening a National Assembly unilaterally under one-party dictatorship, whether postponed for three days or thirty days, is a violation of the Political Consultative Conference resolutions, an illegal act of division, and demonstrates the Kuomintang authorities' determination to maintain long-term dictatorship and long-term civil war. The CCP, of course, firmly opposes this."

    非法国大延期三天
    并不改变严重局势
    中共代表团发言人发表谈话
    【新华社延安十二日电】南京讯：中共代表团发言人梅益于十一日就蔡政府宣布国大延期三天事发表谈话，梅氏称：“中共对国民党当局此举并不重视，此举并未改变当前严重局势。在一党专政下召开一手包办的国大，不论延期三天或三十天，都是违反政协决议的、非法的分裂行动，都表示国民党当局长期独裁，长期内战之决心，对此中共当然坚决反对。
    【新华社延安十二日电】据中央社南京电：蒋政府十一日命令宣布国大延期三天。
