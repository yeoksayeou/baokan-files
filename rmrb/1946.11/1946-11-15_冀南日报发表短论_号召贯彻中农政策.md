    Jinnan Daily Publishes Short Article
    Calling for Implementation of the Middle Peasant Policy
    [Our Weixian Dispatch, 10th] The Jinnan Daily here recently published a short article calling for the implementation of the middle peasant policy. It pointed out that organizing 90% of the masses is a guiding principle that must be implemented in mass movements. In the Yongzhi anti-traitor and grievance-airing movement, 90% of the peasant households participated in the struggle; in the Ningnan peasant emancipation movement, over 80% of the middle peasants joined peasant associations; in the Yuanchao leveling and offsetting movement, the middle peasant policy was promptly publicized, uniting the middle peasants to participate in the struggle. These are worth learning from in various regions. It also stated: In some areas where the leveling and offsetting movement has recently begun, although it has been proposed to unite the middle peasants, it has not been well grasped in the actual movement. In some districts and villages, the middle peasants were struggled against; in some districts and villages, the middle peasants were panicked, eating and drinking extravagantly, and not engaging in production. In some districts and villages, middle peasants "volunteered land"; in some districts and villages, they were satisfied with not struggling against the middle peasants and the middle peasants feeling secure, and did not actively unite them. It further pointed out the reasons for the deviations: First, the leadership's thinking was not clear. They did not properly study specific practices, did not conduct in-depth education on the middle peasant policy among the masses, did not make "the middle and poor peasants are one family" a guiding principle for the masses' actions, and did not make the middle peasants aware of our policy and the wrongs of past damages to the interests of individual middle peasants. Second, due to the rumors of landlords and local bullies, such as the landlord of Dan Village in the Fourth District of Gucheng, who spread rumors to intimidate wealthy middle peasants and middle peasants, saying, "Everyone who has more than one mu of land will be struggled against, so donate your land!" The landlord of Hongzhuang in Yuanchao spread rumors saying, "Whoever has will be struggled against." This caused the middle peasants to panic. Third, the class divisions were not clear. The masses sometimes regarded the middle peasants as rich peasants or landlords, and the middle peasants did not know what class they belonged to, and when they heard the landlords' rumors, they became panicked. Fourth, the land problems of poor small villages were not resolved by joint struggle and other methods, but only emphasized village-by-village struggle. In small villages without landlords and rich peasants, they struggled against the middle peasants (such as the Fourth District of Guangping). The short article finally called on all regions to earnestly study and implement the middle peasant policy and realize the principle of uniting and organizing over 90% of the masses.

    冀南日报发表短论
    号召贯彻中农政策
    【本报威县十日电】此间冀南日报顷发表短论，号召贯彻中农政策。指出组织百分之九十群众，是群运必须贯彻的方针。永智反奸诉苦运动中，有百分之九十的农户参加斗争，宁南农民翻身运动中，百分之八十以上的中农参加农会，元朝填平补齐运动中，及时宣传了中农政策，团结了中农参加斗争，是值得各地学习的。又称：新近开始填平补齐运动的某些地区，虽曾提出了团结中农，但在实际运动中却没有掌握好，有的区村斗争了中农，有的区村中农，生恐慌，大吃大喝，不事生产。有的区村中农“献田”，有的区村以不斗中农、中农安心为满足，不积极团结他们。继指出发生偏向的原因，第一、由于领导思想不明确。没有很好研究具体做法，没有把中农政策在群众中作深入的教育，没有使“中贫农是一家”成为群众行动的方针，没有使中农认识我们的政策及过去损伤个别中农利益的不对。第二、由于地主恶霸的造谣，如故城四区澹村地主造谣恐吓富中农和中农说：“每人过一亩地就得挨斗，献田罢！”元朝红庄地主造谣说：“谁有就斗谁。”致使中农发生恐慌。第三、阶级划分不明确，群众有时把中农当成富农或地主，中农也不知道自己到底是什么阶层，再听到地主造谣，就恐慌起来。第四、没有用联合斗争及其他方法，解决贫苦小村的土地问题，只是强调了村村斗争，没有地主富农的小村，便斗到中农头上（如广平四区）。短论最后号召各地认真研究与贯彻中农政策，实现团结与组织百分之九十以上的群众的方针。
