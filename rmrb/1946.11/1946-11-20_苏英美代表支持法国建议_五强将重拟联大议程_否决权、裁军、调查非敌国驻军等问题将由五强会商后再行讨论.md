Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th. Reuters reports: The agenda of the United Nations General Assembly's most important committee – the First (Political and Security) Committee – will be revised by agreement of the Big Five. On the 15th, the representatives of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union attending the United Nations General Assembly unanimously agreed to support the French proposal to delay the discussion of the various issues currently submitted to the First Committee (including the veto, disarmament, investigation of foreign troop deployments in non-enemy territories, Franco, etc.) until the representatives of the Big Five meet and clarify their positions and prepare their opinions. The Big Five meeting is scheduled to be held next week. Prior to this French proposal, the First Committee had begun discussing the veto on the 14th.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th. New York dispatch: The United Nations General Assembly's largest committee – the First (Political and Security) Committee – will discuss the Soviet proposal on universal disarmament as soon as possible. Due to deliberate delays by many countries in the First Committee, the committee has engaged in lengthy and unnecessary discussions on the procedures for new member states to join the United Nations. However, this delay has not diminished the world's public opinion (especially American public opinion)'s urgent concern for the Soviet proposal. For example, Molotov's recent speech to the Foreign Press Association has become a central topic of discussion in newspaper commentaries and among people involved with the General Assembly. An Associated Press observer said: "Americans welcome the Soviet Union's repeated proposals to discuss universal disarmament at the current session of the General Assembly." Many American commentators have emphasized that in addition to initiating the proposal, the Soviet Union is also willing to compromise with the United States in order to reach an agreement on the two countries' proposals on disarmament. These commentators declared that the second step should be taken by the United States. (Editor's note: This news tells us that the General Assembly will discuss the issue of disarmament as soon as possible; however, the Reuters dispatch from Yan'an on the 17th also stated that the representatives of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union have unanimously agreed to support the French proposal to delay the discussion of disarmament and other issues, and to hold a meeting of the representatives of the Big Five to prepare their opinions before further discussions. What accounts for this large change? It is likely related to changes in the political situation in France.)

    苏英美代表支持法国建议
    五强将重拟联大议程
    否决权、裁军、调查非敌国驻军等问题将由五强会商后再行讨论
    【新华社延安十七日电】路透社讯：联合国大会最重要的一个委员会——第一（政治安全）委员会之议程，将由五强协议而重新拟定。十五日英美苏出席联合国大会的代表已一致同意，支持法国的建议，延迟讨论现在提交第一委员会的各项问题（包括否决权、裁军、调查非敌国领土上之外国驻军、佛朗哥等问题），直至五强代表集会，并阐明他们的立场与准备好意见时，再行集会。五强会议计划在下周举行，在法国这一建议之前，第一委员会已于十四日起讨论否决权。
    【新华社延安十六日电】纽约讯：联合国大会最大一个委员会——第一（政治与安全）委员会，将尽早讨论苏联关于普遍裁军的建议。由于许多国在第一委员会中采取故意的拖延，该委员会曾对新会员国加入联合国组织的程序问题进行了冗长的不必要的讨论。然而，这种拖延，并未减弱世界舆论（特别是美国舆论）对于苏联建议的急切关怀。例如莫洛托夫最近在外国报界协会上的演说，目前已成为各报评论与联大方面人士谈论的中心题目。美联社观察家说：“美国人欢迎苏联一再的建议，在联大目前会议上则刻讨论普遍裁军问题。”许多美国评论员强调指出，苏联除了首倡之外，并且愿意与美国妥协，以便在两国关于裁军的建议上达到协议。这些评论员宣称，第二步就应该使美国来作了。（编者按：这条消息告诉我们，联大将尽早讨论裁军问题；而十七日延安电路透社讯则又称英美苏三国代表已一致同意支持法国的建议，迟延裁军等问题的讨论，而由五强代表集会准备好意见时再开会讨论。中间为什么有这样大的变化？当与法国政局的变化有关。）
