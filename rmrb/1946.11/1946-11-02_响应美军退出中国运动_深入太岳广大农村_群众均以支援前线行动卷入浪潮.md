Responding to the Movement for American Troops to Withdraw from China
　　Deep into the Vast Rural Areas of Taiyue
　　The Masses are Involved in the Tide of Supporting the Front Lines
　　[Our Newspaper Taiyue Dispatch, 28th] The third, fourth, and fifth days of the Taiyue movement for American troops to withdraw from China have quickly spread to vast towns and villages with overwhelming momentum. In the two days in Shuicun, Yangcheng, teachers and students wrote many clapper talks and Yangko dances, spreading propaganda throughout the seven *lu* and nine villages. The peasants who had been emancipated responded to this movement with practical actions. Women in Yangcheng completed 3,700 pairs of cotton shoes in seven days to support the front lines, and more than 200 full and semi-laborers have set out to transport, completing the transportation of 10,320 *jin* of grain. The Self-Defense Force made three stone grenades each, and women and children also made one each. The militia also began practicing martial arts on the 24th. Middle peasant Li Jinquan, because his house was burned by Chiang's 83rd Division in the past, prepared four stone grenades to deal with the attacking Chiang's troops. Wang Jiulin, a formerly landless man who obtained land today, said, "After being emancipated, we will never be turned over again. The traitor Chiang Kai-shek wants to invite his foreign father to turn us over, and we will fight him to the end." At the American troops withdrawal from China movement meeting in Fengling and other seven villages in the Sixth District, Nan Yu, the director of the Armed Forces Committee, called on the militia to intensify their martial arts training and respond to this movement with practical actions. Zhang Sichun, representing the workers, said that they would improve their technology and strengthen their work efficiency to support the front lines and defeat the joint attack of the Sino-American reactionaries.
　　[Another Dispatch] The Liu Jintang drum ballad group, famous in Taiyue, believes that the movement for American troops to withdraw from China is a major event related to the complete emancipation of the people, so they are busy day and night finding materials and writing drum ballads. Now they have compiled three volumes of drum ballads and four sections of fast clapper, about 30,000 words, and are preparing to print them in batches and distribute them to the drum ballad groups and propaganda groups in Yangcheng, Shimin, Jincheng, Gaoping and other places that have been organized. Each group now has 150 propagandists, and they plan to disperse to every corner of the countryside for a long time to thoroughly expose all the conspiracies of the American Chiang clique. The drum ballad group personally led by Liu Jintang began to sing drum ballads everywhere on the 26th to promote propaganda.
　　[Our Newspaper Taiyue Dispatch, 29th] After the launch of the movement for American troops to withdraw from China, the work efficiency of all employees of the Fourth Military Sub-district's military factory has generally increased by more than one time. People all resentfully said, "If the American troops do not withdraw from China sooner, we will make more ammunition to drive him out of China. We will fight whoever acts as a traitor for the United States." The workers in the hand grenade and stone grenade group used to make an average of five to eight pieces per person per day, but now they are making fifteen pieces. The workers in the repair shop used to make an average of x new guns per month, but now they have not only doubled, but also repaired some old guns. The workers in the sand turning group used to produce 450 shell casings per furnace, but now they have not only increased to 600, but also the quality is very high. The workers who cut wooden handles used to cut an average of 40 pieces per day, but now they have increased to 160 pieces. In these few days, in addition to working hard all day, the workers also automatically took time out at night to discuss current affairs.
　　[Our Newspaper Taiyue Dispatch, 29th] In the movement to demand the withdrawal of American troops from China, dozens of agencies and organizations in the Taiyue District have unanimously joined this movement from the 21st to the 26th of this month. On the 26th, the agencies were divided into 31 groups and went to the countryside to carry out in-depth propaganda. The Henan Democratic National Construction Association wrote a letter calling on Henan people working outside to respond to this movement. The donation movement of various agencies has reached 313,542 yuan as of the 26th, and this donation movement is still ongoing. The agencies also responded to this movement with intensive practical work. The Political Department of the Military Region immediately sent personnel to the hospital to inspect the work. In order to strengthen the speed of mailing, the Yangcheng Post Office has successively established postal agencies in Xiaocheng and other three places. In the past, it took two and a half days to transfer from Yangcheng to Qin County City, but now it only takes two days to make a round trip. Working hours have also increased from eight hours to eleven hours.
