Bian News: Luoning in western Henan suffered from drought this summer, and after the autumn, the people affected by the flooding of the Luo River are finding it very difficult to maintain their livelihoods. Last month, the Kuomintang authorities in the area apportioned more than 48 million yuan for the construction costs of the district security regiment's hospital, more than 100,000 jin of wheat for the security regiment, 3 million yuan for the People's Voice Daily (a Kuomintang-run newspaper) foundation, and more than 7 million yuan for other apportionments, causing the people to complain endlessly.

According to Professor Wu Qiyuan, an economist close to the authorities, since the "victory" up to mid-October this year, the Kuomintang's treasury expenditures totaled approximately 40,000 billion legal tender (excluding the Northeast and Taiwan) (actually more than this number). The purpose of the expenditure was "mainly to satisfy the wishes of vested interest groups." Very little was allocated to economic construction and cultural education related to the country's future. The budget for this year is 25,000 billion yuan, but in reality, it will use 50,000 billion yuan (actually more than this number). Regarding fiscal revenue, Wu pointed out that the Kuomintang's tax policy is to put the burden on the middle and lower classes, and more than half of the tax revenue is embezzled by the authorities. Establishing "state-owned" companies and selling state-owned assets are ways to transfer state-owned property to wealthy classes or vested interest groups.

The Nanjing Chiang government issued an order one day to increase postal and telecommunications prices: ordinary letters increased to 100 yuan, and ordinary newsprint increased to 10 yuan per 50 centimeters in weight.

Chengdu News: According to a report revealed by the Director of the Sichuan Provincial Department of Finance at a provincial government committee meeting on October 4th, the Chiang central government has completely stopped allocating various subsidies to Sichuan Province from October. It is estimated that the regular political expenses of Sichuan Province in October will be more than 2 billion yuan (excluding temporary expenses).

Hankou News: The Pinghan Railway is facing the danger of stopping operations due to the destruction of the Chiang government's civil war policy. Since the "takeover" last year, the railway has transported more than 500,000 Chiang soldiers in 157 trains northward to carry out the civil war, while commercial transport and demobilization are extremely limited. As a result, the Pinghan Railway Bureau's monthly expenditure is more than 4 billion yuan, while its income is only more than 1 billion yuan, resulting in a monthly loss of more than 3 billion yuan. The bureau eagerly hoped to transport local products from various places during the peak months after the autumn harvest to make up for past losses, but because military transport is still extremely frequent, this hope will ultimately be shattered. Xia Guangyu, director of the bureau, recently went to Beijing to request assistance from the Ministry of Communications, but to no avail. According to Xia's remarks to the Kuomintang authorities, he dare not guarantee whether the railway can continue to operate next year. A key employee of the bureau also said: "We hope to transport fewer troops so that the railway bureau can avoid excessive losses. The railway bureau has repeatedly received commendations from higher authorities, but the price of 'glory' is being burned out."

    蒋区经济拾零
    汴讯：豫西洛宁今夏遭旱，秋后因洛水泛滥，被难人民生活很难维持。上月国民党当局在该地摊派区保安团医院建筑费四千八百余万元，保安团小麦十余万斤，民声日报社（国民党官办）基金三百余万元，其他摊款七百余万元，人民叫苦连天。
    据接近官方的经济学家伍启元教授称：国民党自胜利以来迄今年十月中，国库支出共约法币四万数千亿（未包括东北台湾）（按实际不止此数）。支出的用途“主要是满足既得利益集团的愿望”。对于有关国家前途的经济建设文化教育等微乎其微。今年预算是二万五千亿元，但实际将要用到五万亿元（实际不止此数）。在财政收入方面，伍氏指出国民党的税收政策是要把负担压在中下层身上的，并有一半以上税收是当局贪污掉，而成立“国营”公司及出售国有财资，这是把国有财产转移到富裕阶级或既得利益集团手上去的办法。
    南京蒋政府，于一日下令将邮电加价：平信增至一百元，平常新闻纸，每重五十公分增至十元。
    蓉讯：据十月四日四川财政厅长在省府委员会议上报告透露，蒋中央对川省各项补助已自十月份全部停止拨发，预计十月份川省经常政费约在二十亿元以上（临时费不在内）。
    汉口讯：平汉铁路已因蒋政府内战政策的摧残面临停车险境，该铁路自去年“接收”以来，运送北上进行内战的蒋军达五十余万，计一百五十七列车，商运及复员，为数极少。以致平汉路局每月开支四十余亿元，而收入只十余亿元，每月亏累达三十余亿元之多。该局热望于秋收后的旺月，多运各地物产，以弥补过去损失，复因军运仍极频繁，此种希望终归破灭。该局局长夏光宇近赴京向交通部请求挽救，毫无结果。据夏对国民党当局表示，明年能否继续通车已不敢保证。该局一重要职员亦谓：“希望少运些军队，路局才能避免亏累过甚，路局迭获上峰嘉奖，但“光荣”的代价，是焦头烂额。”
