    Unleash the Masses in Xitao
    Lǚ Liáng, Zhèn Guó
    In the intense twenty-day movement in Xitao Village, Wuzhi Second District, the power of landlords and local bullies was crushed, and over a hundred impoverished and poor peasant households obtained land. Over ninety percent of the households received benefits, making it one of the first villages in the district to complete "land to the tiller." The main experiences are as follows:
    (1) Swiftly Mobilize, Continuously Struggle
    When the turn-over team arrived in Xitao to mobilize, cadres and activists demanded immediate struggle and showed no interest in empty discussions, saying, "The bitterness is right here, a single struggle will lift us up." At that time, to accommodate this sentiment, after simple brewing and mobilization, we launched a struggle against the landlord Yang Huailiang. As a result, the masses could not keep up, they could not break through the facade with the despotic landlord, they could not reason face-to-face, and their complaints were not thorough, forming a situation of shouting without movement. After the meeting, when the masses were mobilized to move things from the landlord's house, some did not want to go.
    Thus, we adopted a method of continuous follow-up struggle: The first day after the struggle, the second day would be spent settling accounts, with the poor and the landlord settling accounts face to face, the poor complaining and reasoning at the same time. As a result, the grievances not aired at the struggle meeting were all poured out at this time. Complain about one grievance, settle one account. The landlord said, "You can calculate however you want." The masses retorted, "No! You should repay based on how you exploited!" Emotions were very high.
    On the third day, we followed up by pursuing the fruits of labor, calling the landlord to his home. Initially, he stubbornly denied burying anything, and some of the masses still believed him. Later, ten shi of wheat were dug up. The masses said, "Humph! He is really a benevolent master; the poor have nothing to eat, but his family's grain has been stored for three years." Afterwards, more than sixty rows of bullets were dug up, further exposing the landlord's "conspiracy of hiding bullets from the militia and preparing for the change of the sky." This continuously influenced and educated the masses in neighboring villages.
    Finally, the fruits of labor were distributed, and Yang Huailiang's six major crimes were announced at the meeting, and Yang gradually lowered his head and admitted them.
    In total, this landlord was subjected to five consecutive struggles: The pre-struggle meeting detention of the struggle target Yang Xiaobu, exposing the rumor of "being on good terms with the district," was the first struggle. The struggle rally was the second struggle. The third struggle was face-to-face accounting, which was a great exercise for the masses themselves. Requesting the fruits of labor and digging for things was the more intense fourth struggle. Specific examples educated the masses. Finally, the fifth struggle announced the crimes, summarized the landlord's ugliness, completely tore off his mask, and the landlord lowered his head.
    At the beginning of the movement, the masses, especially the cadres, eagerly demanded action, and this enthusiasm should be cherished and acted upon immediately, so that it is not cooled. It is inevitable that the struggle will not be mature. Only by implementing continuous struggle in action, defeating the landlord's rule (especially the exposure of the "benevolent old miser") and training the masses is a more suitable method.
    (2) Launch Large-Scale Complaints and Struggles, Combining Ideological Mobilization and Struggle Action.
    After the first struggle victory, the peasant association was quickly reviewed, summarized and developed. The movement was immediately carried out while riding on the victory. At that time, the autumn harvest had already begun. Cadres and activists suggested struggling after planting wheat. Many of the masses were also willing to "wait for the landlord to plant wheat." But in fact, the target of the struggle, out of fear of struggle, was not at all focused on production, but secretly transferred assets. The more it was delayed, the more the masses suffered. There were also some masses who wanted to hide behind and not come forward, waiting to divide things. At that time, based on this situation, a policy of massive offensive against despotic landlords was put forward. In cadre meetings and mass meetings, everyone discussed and specifically settled accounts: fighting one family and then another would take time and delay work, and everyone would suffer if the landlord transferred things away, and they would not be able to turn themselves over if they did not rise up to fight. Slogans of "settling all bitter debts together," "large-scale complaints and large-scale turn-over," "turn over quickly, turn over once, everyone turns over" were put forward. In addition, an investigation was made into production: The early autumn harvest had been successively completed, and only jade corns remained, which could be largely harvested in three days. It was proposed that men, women, old and young all go to the fields together, and complete three days of work in two days, harvesting in the daytime and complaining at night. This call was universally and enthusiastically supported by the masses.
    The next day, complaints were divided by street at night, and indeed exceeded the "plans" of the village cadres and activists. Seven or eight despotic landlords were complained about. At the meeting, Shi Laohu's mother and others complained and cried bitterly, and could not be stopped no matter how much they were persuaded. After the meeting dispersed late at night, Shi Shuangji's woman returned and asked to let him complain first tomorrow. After only one black night and two afternoons of brewing, a large-scale struggle was launched, and thirteen despotic landlords were struggled against in one and a half days, forming a climax of the movement.
    The struggle meeting completely adopted the mass form, presided over by the village cadres and activists themselves. Thousands of masses sat in a circle, and the targets of the struggle stood in the field, and the complainants entered the field to reason face to face. When the emotions were agitated, the masses freely exchanged and brewed, and even stood up to show their strength. When Shi Tou's mother complained, Yang Dong's sister-in-law and the "old chairman," two old ladies, automatically entered the field to help reason. The next day, the meeting was divided into two sessions in the same large field. The masses who had problems with whom participated in that session. Because the form was unrestricted, complaining and reasoning were very powerful and straightforward. Practical evidence shows that the masses' ideological awareness is fastest in struggle actions. This time, more than 100 issues, more than 20 of which were not mentioned when complaining, were temporarily raised under the impetus of the great tide. The masses also continuously enriched new content in the struggle, such as pursuing the transfer of things by the families of escaped despotic landlords on the spot, and "ventilators" (communicating with the Chiang Kai-shek troops in the east), and their emotions continued to rise.
    (3) Distributing the Fruits of Labor Must Be Fair, Fast, Universal, and Meet Needs
    After struggling against landlord Yang Huailiang, in order to prevent his family from continuing to transfer things, the masses were mobilized to liquidate things immediately after the meeting. After the accounting was completed on the third day, it was immediately distributed in the rain. Before the distribution, the amount of the landlord's exploitation and debt was announced. The masses said, "Yang Huailiang concealed 30 mu of black land for decades, and each household has advanced enough for several thousand yuan. It is too cheap for him to only take a beam from him." After the second major struggle, all the masses in the village started to work, moving and digging out the things that the despotic landlords had extorted. It was all moved in two days and immediately distributed. More than 80 activists who dared to speak and fight in the struggle were selected as evaluators, divided into four classes: extremely poor, poor households, middle peasants and well-to-do middle peasants. Military families were given special treatment. The fruits of struggle were classified and arranged, grouped and evaluated, with wheat as the standard. All the materials dug out were valued uniformly. Out of 603 households in the village (except for the bailiffs and others who had not confessed), 556 households were allocated fruits of labor, 40 military families received eight dou per household, the extremely poor received five dou (a large number of evaluators accounted for a quarter), the poor peasants received three dou (all of the above also received additional food), the middle peasants received two dou, and the well-to-do middle peasants received one dou. In order to reward the complainants, each was given an additional two dou according to the agreed-upon grade. When discussing what to distribute to which class, the dispute was unresolved. Wu Bao's mother said, "Everyone should have a better life after turning over. The poor have no houses to live in, so they should be distributed to the poor first." Finally, it was decided that everything would be voluntary. First, let the military families want it, and draw paper eggs to determine the order. Then, go down by grade. Therefore, the distribution of fruits of labor satisfied the wishes of most people.

    放手发动在西陶
    吕梁  振国
    武陟二区西陶村二十天的紧张运动中，摧垮了地主恶霸势力，一百余户赤贫与贫农取得了土地，百分之九十以上户口分得利益，成为全区较早完成耕者有其田的村庄之一，其主要经验有以下几点：
    （一）迅速发动，连续斗争
    翻身队到达西陶动员时，干部积极分子都要求赶快斗争，对空讨论没兴趣，说“苦就在嘴边，一斗就能起来”。当时为照顾这一情绪，经过简单酝酿动员，就发动了对地主杨怀良的斗争，结果群众跟不上，对恶霸地主撕不破情面，不会当面说理，诉苦不透，形成干喊不动。散会后发动群众去地主家搬东西，有的就不想去。
    这样我们就采用了连续跟踪斗争的办法：第一天斗过，第二天接着就算账，诉苦穷人和地主对脸算账，穷人一面诉苦一面说理。结果在斗争会上没诉出的苦水，这时都倒出来了。诉一桩苦，算一笔账，地主说：“大家愿意怎么算就怎么算吧”，群众反驳说：“不对！你怎么剥削就该怎么还！”情绪都非常高。
    第三天跟着就追讨果实，把地主叫到他家，开始他固执不承认有埋藏的东西，有的群众还相信他，后来刨出十石麦子，群众说：“哼！这可真是善财主，穷人没啥吃，他家谷子陈三年”。其后又刨出六十多排子弹，更揭露了地主“藏子弹不给民兵，准备变天的阴谋”，这样一直影响和教育了邻村的群众。
    最后分配果实，会上宣布了杨怀良六大罪状，杨逐渐低头承认了。
    总计此次对地主连续进行了五次斗争：斗争会前扣押斗争对象杨小不，揭破“和区上好”的造谣，是第一斗，斗争大会是第二斗，第三次斗争是当面算账，对群众本身有很大锻炼，要果实刨东西，是更激烈的第四次斗争，具体事例教育了群众，最后第五次斗争宣布罪状，把地主丑恶作了总结，彻底撕破了脸，地主低了头。
    在运动开始时，群众尤其是干部迫切要求行动，应珍重这一热情立即行动，不要冷了，斗争不成熟是难免的，只有在行动中施行连续斗争，打垮地主统治（特别是对善老财的暴露）锻炼群众才是比较适合的办法。
    （二）展开大诉苦大斗争，思想发动与斗争行动结合。
    第一个斗争胜利后，很快检讨总结发展一下农会，立即乘胜开展运动，当时已开始秋忙，干部积极分子意见，种罢麦子再斗争，群众有不少也愿意“等地主种麦子”。但事实上斗争对象因害怕斗争，根本不安心生产，反而暗下转移资财，越拖延，群众越吃亏，还有部分群众想躲在后面不出头，坐等分东西，当时便根据这种情形提出了向恶霸地主大进攻的方针，在干部会和群众会上，和大家讨论，具体算账：斗完一家再斗一家，费时误工，地主转走东西大家吃亏，自己不起来斗争翻不了身。提出“苦账一齐算”，“大诉苦大翻身”，“赶快翻，一次翻，大家翻”的口号，另外对生产作了一个调查：早秋已陆续收完，只剩玉茭三天可大部收毕，便提出男女老少一齐上地，三天工两天完，白天收秋，黑夜诉苦，这一号召得到群众普遍热烈的拥护。
    第二天晚分街诉苦，果然超出了村干积极分子从前的“计划”，诉了七八家恶霸，会上史老虎娘等诉苦诉得痛哭失声，劝都劝不止，深夜散会后，史双吉女人又返回要求明天让他先诉，前后只经一黑夜两下午酝酿，就发动大斗争，一天半内斗争了十三家恶霸，形成运动高潮。
    斗争会完全采用了群众形式，由村干积极分子自己主持，千余群众围坐一圈，斗争对象站在场中，诉苦人进场对面论理。群情激昂时，群众自由交谈酝酿，甚至立起，显示力量，史石头娘诉苦时，杨栋嫂和“老主席”两个老太太自动进场帮助说理。第二天便分成两场在同一大场上开会，群众和谁有问题就参加那一场，由于形式不受拘束，诉苦说理都非常有力、干脆。实际证明：在斗争行动中群众思想觉悟最快，这次一百多件问题，有二十多件是诉苦时没有说，在大浪潮推动下临时提出的，群众并不断在斗争中充实新内容，如对逃跑恶霸家属当场追究转移东西，及“透气筒”（和东边蒋军通气）等，情绪不断上涨。
    （三）分配果实要公平，迅速、普遍、适合需要
    斗争地主杨怀良后，为防止其家属继续转移东西，便发动群众在散会后立刻去清算东西，第三天算完后，立即冒雨分配，分配前宣布了地主剥削亏欠数目，群众说：“杨怀良三十亩黑地隐瞒几十年，家家户户垫够几千元，只拿他一根梁条，真是太便宜了他。”第二次大斗争后，全村群众都动手，搬刨恶霸讹走的东西，两天就搬完了，也立即分配。选出斗争中敢说敢斗的八十余积极分子任评议，分极贫，贫户，中农及富裕中农等四等，军属为特等。把斗争果实分类排列，分组估价，以麦子为标准，所有斗出物资，一律估价，全村六百零三户，（除斗争对象尚未坦白的保长等）分果实者五百五十六户，军属四十户，每户八斗，极贫五斗（评议户数较多达四分之一）贫农三斗，（以上均另发粮食）中农二斗，富裕中农一斗，为奖励诉苦人，各按议定等级增加二斗，在讨论什么东西分给那一阶层时，争议不决，武豹娘说：“翻了身大家都该好过，穷人没房住，先分给穷人才对”，最后决定全部采取自愿，先让军属要，抓纸蛋定出先后，以后再按等级往下轮，因此分配果实使大多数人满足心意。
