　　New Heroes Emerge from Liangshan Marsh
	Song Jiang Detachment's Squad Leader Sun Leads Team to Repel Invading Troops
	People in Occupied Areas Refuse to Be Slaves
	Night Raid on Jining City to Capture Returning Home Corps
	[Our Correspondent Team on the Jilu豫 Front, Sixteenth Dispatch] After the Chiang Kai-shek troops occupied Yuncheng and Jining, the people of Liangshan Marsh, who throughout history have refused to be slaves to any tyrant or autocrat, bravely took up arms and formed the Canal Detachment and the Song Jiang Detachment, striking the enemy at every opportunity. Early in the morning of November 5th, more than 300 men of Chiang Kai-shek's direct line 11th Division, pulling several horses carrying American cannons, swaggered along the southern bank of the levee. Sun Jin贤, the squad leader of the Song Jiang Detachment guarding the levee, had already spotted the enemy. He ordered three other team members to disperse to three small villages: Liu Lou Village, Xiao Ma Lou Village, and others, while he himself lay in ambush facing Liu Kou. The Chiang Kai-shek troops slowly climbed the levee. Sun Jin贤 fired the first shot from the front, and the guns from the three villages fired together, scaring the Chiang Kai-shek troops so much that they lay flat on the levee, afraid to raise their heads. Later, dragging four wounded, they scurried back. As Sun Jin贤 had expected, ten minutes later, the Chiang Kai-shek troops' cannons and machine guns unleashed a barrage, but no one dared to climb the levee again until they ceased firing at noon and returned to their camp. The Chiang Kai-shek special forces' armed "Returning Home Corps" in Jining moved from the city to the southern gate, extorting money from merchants and looting residents, and even more outrageously, arresting so-called "underground Eighth Route Army members." Under the slogan of "We won't let them harm our brothers," the Canal Detachment, composed of Jining militiamen, quietly entered the southern gate on the night of October 9th. Ren, the deputy captain of the detachment, placed two machine guns on the south bank of the canal, aiming at the city, preventing the Chiang Kai-shek troops from daring to step out. Deputy Captain Ren led several team members, climbed the "Returning Home Corps"' building, and a dozen "Returning Home Corps" members were captured. Then they slipped newspapers and propaganda into the doors and windows of various homes. When dawn broke, they left Jining with the prisoners. "The Eighth Route Army hasn't left; sooner or later, they'll be looking for trouble." The next day, the "Returning Home Corps" at the southern gate all retreated back into the city.

　　梁山泊出新英雄
    宋江支队孙班长率队击退进犯军
    侵陷区人民不愿做奴隶
    夜袭济宁市捉拿还乡团
    【本报冀鲁豫前线记者团十六日电】蒋军侵占郓城、济宁后，历代不甘做任何暴君独裁者奴隶的梁山泊人民，英勇拿起武器，组成了运河支队与宋江支队，随时随地打击敌人。十一月五日清早，蒋家嫡系十一师三百多人，赶着几匹驮美国炮的大马，由堤南摇摆着走过来，守卫着河堤的宋江支队班长孙进贤，早就看准了敌人。他命令另外三个队员分散到刘楼庄、小马楼等三个小村，他自己伏在刘口的正面。蒋军慢慢的爬上大堤，孙进贤从正面打了第一枪，三个村子的枪也一齐打过来，吓得蒋军伏在堤上不敢抬头。后来拉着四个伤员窜回去了。正如孙进贤所料，十分钟后蒋军的大炮、机枪，一阵一阵的齐轰起来，但再没有一个敢爬上大堤，直到中午收兵回营。济宁的蒋特武装“还乡团”，由市内移到南关，在关里勒索商家，抢掠住户，更猖狂的是捕杀所谓“暗八路”。在“不让他残害咱家弟兄”的口号下，济宁民兵组成的运河支队，在十月九号的夜里，悄悄的进入南关，支队里的任大队副把两挺机枪安放在运河的南岸，对准城里，使蒋军不敢走出一步，任大队副带领着几个队员，爬上“还乡团”的大楼，十几个“还乡团”员被抓了出来，然后把报纸和宣传品递进各处的门窗里。东方亮了，他们带着俘虏离开了济宁。“八路军并没走，迟早总要找点事的。”南关的“还乡团”，第二天全都缩回城里去了。
