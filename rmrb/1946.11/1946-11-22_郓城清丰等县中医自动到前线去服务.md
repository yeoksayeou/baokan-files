　　[Report from this newspaper in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area] Concurrent with doctors from Puyang County joining the war effort, a large number of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) practitioners from Yuncheng, Qingfeng, and other counties have also brought their own medicines and voluntarily followed stretcher teams to the front lines to provide services, enabling the smooth completion of wartime support work. Mr. Lu Pin'san, a renowned doctor in the Third District of Yuncheng, and others generously initiated a campaign to raise funds for medicines for the county stretcher brigade. Upon arriving at the county stretcher team, he felt that there were too many patients and a lack of medicine. Therefore, he requested to go home to purchase medicine. After returning home, he immediately consulted with the Yuesheng Tang and Wansheng Yong pharmacies in Lvdantun, discussing the condition of the patients in the stretcher team with them. They were greatly moved and enlightened, and were willing to sell medicines to the government at the original cost price (even though prices had increased several times). As a result, Yuesheng Tang donated medicines worth 13,700 yuan, and Wansheng Yong also donated medicines worth 6,700 yuan. Mr. Lu then initiated fundraising to pay for the medicines, and also rushed to prepare a portion of the medicine himself. Two days later, he returned to the county stretcher team. After several days of his diagnoses, all two hundred or so patients in the team slowly recovered. Mr. Lu is an elderly man in his fifties with white hair. He could not walk long distances, but County Magistrate Yuan offered him a horse to ride. He refused to ride and also declined the care of a messenger, saying that his body could not withstand the hardships of war. Only after repeated explanations from the county team headquarters did he agree to return home. However, he was still worried, so he divided the medicines into small packages according to the severity of the illness, noting the dosage and usage clearly before leaving. The stretcher bearers were all grateful to him.

　　In the stretcher team of the Eleventh District of Qingfeng, Mr. Zhu Wenzeng and Mr. Han participated in the treatment work. Medicine for the company headquarters was supplied by higher authorities, but after departure, contact was not made with higher authorities, and many people had become ill. Therefore, Mr. Zhu and Mr. Han used the medicines they had brought from home. In total, Mr. Zhu provided medicines worth seven or eight thousand yuan, and Mr. Han also provided medicines worth a thousand yuan. They cured a hundred or so patients, enabling the stretcher team to carry out its work smoothly.

　　郓城清丰等县中医自动到前线去服务
    【本报冀鲁豫讯】与濮县医生参战同时，郓城、清丰等县大批中医都自带了药品，自动的跟随担架队到前线去服务，使战勤工作顺利完成了任务。郓城三区名医鹿品三先生等，慷慨发起为县担架大队捐募药品。他一到县担架队，就感到病员太多，而药品又缺乏，于是他便要求回家购买药品。回家后，马上到吕丹屯药行育盛堂、万盛永商量，把担架队病员情形和他们谈了，他们受到很大感动与启示，愿意将药品按原本（物价已涨数倍）折扣卖给公家，于是育盛堂捐输一万三千七百元药品，万盛永也捐出六千七百元药品，鹿先生便发起募捐，将药钱付了，同时又赶忙配制了一部分药。两天后，他回到了县担架队，经过他几天的疹断，全队二百多个病号，都慢慢的好了。鹿先生已白发苍苍，五十多岁的人了，他不能走远路，苑县长让他骑马，他不骑也不要通讯员照顾他。因为遇到战争他身体坚持不了。县队部再三说明，他才肯回家，但他仍不放心，他便依据病的轻重，分别药量的大小包成包，注明用法，交待的清清楚楚才回去。担架员对他无不感谢。
    清丰十一区的担架队，有朱文增、韩先生两人参加担架队的治疗工作。中队部药由上级供给，但出发后，未和上级取上联系，有很多人已经生病了，于是朱、韩二先生就将自己从家带出来的药用上了。总计朱先生拿出价值七、八千元的药，韩先生也拿出有千元的药，他们将百十名病号治好了，使担架队顺利进行工作。
