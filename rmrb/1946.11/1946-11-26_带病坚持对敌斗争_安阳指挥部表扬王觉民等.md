　　Enduring the Struggle Against the Enemy While Sick
    Anyang Headquarters Commends Wang Juemin and Others
    [This Dispatch from Changzhi] The Anyang Headquarters recently issued a circular to commend Comrades Wang Juemin and others. The circular pointed out: Since the enemy's attack on Shuiye, many Wang Juemins have emerged, and they have truly become fighters who serve the people consistently in word and deed. Those commended include Wang Juemin, District Chief of the Fifth District; Feng Rijian, Secretary of the Third District; Zhang Jian, Public Security Officer of the Seventh District; and Liu Guiduo, Village Chief of Shanzhuang Village in the First District. Comrade Juemin has led the militia to wage guerrilla warfare against the enemy since the enemy occupied Quwan in August. Although recently suffering from malaria, he shows no signs of fatigue. Comrade Rijian persisted in his work alone during the Shuiye defense battle, busying himself day and night without complaint. Comrade Guiduo has always been active in his work and personally led stretcher teams to rescue the wounded. In this war, after organizing the transfer of cadres, he led the militia to persist in the struggle in his village. The circular finally called on everyone to carry forward the spirit of arduous struggle and strive to be a true people's fighter. (Shi Hong)

　　带病坚持对敌斗争
    安阳指挥部表扬王觉民等
    【本报长治讯】安阳指挥部顷通令表扬王觉民等同志。该通令指出：自敌进攻水冶以来，出现了不少的王觉民，他们真正成了言行一致的为人民服务的战士。被表扬者有五区区长王觉民，三区秘书冯日俭，七区公安干事张健，一区山庄村村长刘桂铎等。觉民同志，自八月敌占曲湾后，即带领民兵与敌展开游击战。近日虽身染疟疾，却毫无倦色。日俭同志，在水冶保卫战中，独自坚持工作，昼夜奔忙，毫无怨言。桂铎同志一向工作积极，曾亲领担架抢救伤员。在此次战争中，有组织的把干部转移走后，即领导民兵坚持本村斗争。该通令最后号召大家发扬艰苦卓绝的精神，为做一个真正的人民战士奋斗。（史洪）
