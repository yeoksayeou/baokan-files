　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 26th. According to reports from the Associated Press and United Press International in Nanjing: On the 24th, Luo Longji, one of the leaders of the Democratic League, read out the Democratic League's formal statement at a press conference and provided an explanation. Luo stated: The Democratic League will not recognize the "Constitution" passed by the "National Assembly" because the convening of the "National Assembly" violates the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC). The Democratic League's boycott of the "National Assembly" is due to the fact that this "National Assembly" was not convened as a united constitutional assembly in accordance with the spirit of the PCC and the agreed procedures. Luo continued: The "Constitutional Draft" approved by the Legislative Yuan is not the PCC's constitutional draft. The PCC never completed its constitutional draft, and many points of the "Constitutional Draft" approved by the Legislative Yuan were opposed by us. Luo said: The Democratic League has requested the Democratic Socialist Party to withdraw from the Democratic League because the party's participation in the "National Assembly" has violated the Democratic League's covenant. Luo reiterated that the Democratic League's policy is to fight for peace, unity, and democracy. We cannot tolerate the current situation continuing and must find a way out. Luo warned: Once the Kuomintang army attacks Yan'an, the central city of the Communist Party, all hopes for a peaceful solution will come to an end.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 26th. According to various reports: Under the initiative of Zhang Junmai, the Democratic Socialist Party decided to participate in Chiang Kai-shek's puppet National Assembly. Its list of "representatives" was submitted on the 24th, but opinions within the Democratic Socialist Party are divided. According to the Associated Press in Nanjing: On the evening of the 22nd, the party's spokesman, Jin Houcheng, stated: Zhang Junmai, Zhang Dongsun, and Wu Xianzi are not "National Assembly representatives." He admitted that there is a large opposition faction within the Democratic Socialist Party opposing participation in the National Assembly. He said that Zhang Junmai's non-participation in the "National Assembly" is "for the convenience of both the government and the Democratic Socialist Party." Zhang Dongsun and Wu Xianzi (note: Wu Xianzi is the leader of the Chinese American Democratic Constitutional Party; the Democratic Socialist Party is a combination of that party and the National Socialist Party) resisted the National Assembly because they did not believe the government could implement democracy. According to a report from Peiping: Before formally participating in the "National Assembly," the Democratic Socialist Party sent Sun Baogang and Ye Duyi to Peiping to discuss with Zhang Dongsun, the party's northern leader. After the consultation, Zhang told the resident reporter of the Dagang Daily in Peiping: "The colleagues in Beijing and Shanghai invited me to Beijing this time, but I did not consider it. It is appropriate for our party to maintain a third-party stance and not participate in the National Assembly."

　　罗隆基氏正式声明
    民盟反对伪国大伪宪法
    责民社党参加“国大”要求该党退出民盟
    【新华社延安二十六日电】据合众社美联社南京讯：二十四日民盟负责人之一罗隆基，在记者招待会上宣读民盟的正式声明，并加以解说。罗氏称：民盟当不承认“国大”所通过之“宪法”，因“国大”之召开是违反政协决议的。民盟之抵制“国大”，系因此次“国大”并不是按照政协精神及协定程序而召开的团结的立宪大会。罗氏继称：立法院所核准的“宪草”，并不是政协会的宪草，政协会绝未完成其宪草，而且立法院所批准的“宪草”好多点是我们反对过的。罗氏说：民盟已要求民主社会党退出民盟，因为该党参加“国大”，已破坏民盟盟约。罗氏重申民盟之政策是为和平、团结、民主而斗争，我们不能容忍目前情况继续下去，必须找出路。罗氏警告称：一旦国民党军队进攻共产党的中心城市——延安，一切和平解决的希望将俱告结束。
    【新华社延安二十六日电】据各方报道：在张君劢倡议之下，民社党决定参加蒋记猪仔国大，其“代表”名单已于二十四日提出，但民社党内部意见分歧。据合众社南京讯：二十二日晚该党发言人金侯成称：张君劢、张东荪、伍宪子不是“国大代表”，他承认民社党内部有大的反对派反对参加国大。他说张君劢不参加“国大”，是“为了政府与民社党两方面的方便”。张东荪与伍宪子（按伍宪子为旅美华侨民主立宪党领袖，民社党即由该党与国社党合成）抵制国大，是由于不相信政府能实行民主。又据北平讯：民社党在正式参加“国大”前，曾派孙宝刚、叶笃义至北平与该党北方领导人张东荪商谈，张氏于会商后语大刚报驻平记者称：“此次京沪同人约余赴京，本人未予考虑，本党以第三者立场以不参加国大为宜”。
