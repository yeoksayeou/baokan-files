    Land-Reformed Peasant Yi Fuyuan Buys Two Guns to Protect His Hometown
    [This newspaper's dispatch] When Dujiachuang in the tenth district of Wu'an was preparing for war and reorganizing the militia, Yi Fuyuan, the land-reformed Farmers' Association Director, in order to protect everyone's fruits of land reform, sold his donkey for 60,000 yuan and bought two rifles and 600 bullets for the militia to use. Still feeling that the militia was too small, he and his son both joined the militia. He said with great confidence, "We are a 'father and son team.' Together with everyone, we will definitely fight the Chiang bandits to the end, get rid of Chiang Kai-shek, and everyone will be liberated!" All the land-reformed masses in the village responded to his call, united around the "father and son team," elected him as a hero, and are preparing to participate in the county-wide meeting of heroes.
