　　Giving His Strong Fortifications to New Soldiers
    Zheng Dehe Sets an Example on the Front Line
    [Report from the Jilu Yu Frontline Reporter Corps, 23rd] The Second Battalion is doing a good job of caring for new soldiers, and Comrade Zheng Dehe is actively helping new soldiers solve their difficulties. Comrade Zheng Dehe, the leader of the three-person team of the ninth squad of the Second Battalion, came from the Fifth Military Sub-district's recruit camp last year. He is very united in the squad. Especially in war, his concern and care for new soldiers is worth learning from. On September 30th, when the ninth squad was defending Hou Dongzhuang, Comrade Liu Yingcai in the southeast corner of the fortifications was wounded in the leg by an explosion, and the new soldier, Comrade Dong Weicheng, was frightened. At this time, Comrade Zheng Dehe called him to his fortifications and said, "My fortifications are strong, cannonballs won't collapse them, and the enemy's machine guns can't sweep through them. I'll go to your fortifications." As soon as they had exchanged fortifications, the enemy attacked. Comrade Zheng ran to the parapet to fight the enemy. When Dong Weicheng saw him so brave, he followed suit and repelled the enemy. When enemy shells came, Comrade Zheng urged him to quickly go to the fortifications for cover and told him to monitor the enemy through the gun holes. In the evening in Huayuan Village, he and Dong Weicheng worked together to repair the fortifications. Because Dong Weicheng didn't know how, he said to Weicheng, "Let's do this, you use the hoe, and I'll use the shovel." The top of the fortifications also needed to be covered with boards. The two of them only found a door panel. He first put it on top of Weicheng's fortifications and told Dong Weicheng to rest, while he continued to dig soil on top of the fortifications. Later, the superiors ordered them to prepare a day's worth of dry rations. Zhou Bosong and Dong Weicheng were worried that they wouldn't be able to carry them. Comrade Dehe gave his rice bag to Dong Weicheng and then used his own trousers to sew two rice bags, one for Comrade Zhou and one for himself. When they were stationed in Bihai Village, the ninth squad had an average of seven or eight hand grenades per person. The newly liberated soldier, Comrade Zhou Bosong, didn't have a grenade pouch. Comrade Zhou Bosong was very anxious and said, "What if I drop them when something happens?" Comrade Zheng Dehe was also worried. He got up and sat down in the courtyard, trying to think of a solution. Suddenly, he found a broken grenade pouch left behind by another unit. He picked it up, sewed it up himself, and gave it to Comrade Zhou Bosong. At this time, the other comrades all laughed and said, "The old leader always has a way."

　　把自己坚固工事换给新战士
    郑德合火线上起模范
    【本报冀鲁豫前线记者团二十三日电】二大队爱护新战士工作搞得好，郑德合积极帮助新战士解决困难。二大队九小队九班三人组长郑德合同志，去年从五分区新兵营来的，在班里团结都很好，尤其在战争中，对新战士的关心和照顾，是值得学习的。九月三十日，九小队坚守后董庄时，在东南角工事里的刘英才同志炸伤了腿，新战士董卫成同志害了怕，这时郑德合同志就将他叫到自己的工事来说：“我的工事坚固，炮弹打不塌，敌人机枪也扫不透，我到你那工事里去”。刚刚换好工事，敌人进攻了，郑同志跑到围子上去打敌人，董卫成看到他这样勇敢，也跟上来了，将敌人打退了。敌人炮弹打来，郑同志就督促他赶快去工事里荫蔽，并告诉他从枪眼里监视敌人。在花园村的晚上，和董卫成伙修工事，因为董卫成不会，他向卫成说：“咱两个，你使锄头，我用铲”，工事上面还要盖板，两个人只找着一块门板，他先给卫成同志搭到工事上，叫董卫成去休息，自己却仍在工事上面掘土。后来上级命令准备一天的干粮，周柏松、董卫成发愁无法带，德合同志把自己米袋给董卫成，再用自己的单裤子缝两个米袋，给周同志一个，自己用一个。在毕海村住时，九班平均每人七八个手榴弹，解放过来的新战士周柏松同志没有手榴弹袋，周柏松同志很着急说：“有事情掉了怎么办呢？”郑德合同志也发了愁，在院里起来坐下想办法，忽然找到别的部分扔下的坏炸弹袋子，拾起来亲自下手缝好，送给周柏松同志，这时其他同志都笑哈哈的说：“到底老大哥有办法。”
