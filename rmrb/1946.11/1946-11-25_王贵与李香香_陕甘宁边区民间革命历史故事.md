　　Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang
    --A Folk Revolutionary Historical Story from the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region
    Li Ji
    Part One
    1. Landlord Cui Collects Rent
    In the 19th year of the Republic of China,
    A heartbreaking event occurred in Sanbian.
    Everyone says Sanbian has three treasures,
    Few rich people and many poor.
    The endless old yellow sand,
    Which piece of land doesn't belong to the landlord?
    Little rain fell in the 18th year of the Republic,
    The crops were like charcoal being roasted.
    It's hard for the blind to walk in the dark,
    The poor are most afraid of famine years.
    Famine years are feared at the end, not the beginning,
    Everyone worries about the spring famine in the 19th year.
    After digging out bitter herbs, they go up the trees,
    Not a single green sprout is seen anywhere.
    Digging bones from graves to grind into flour,
    Mothers cook their children's flesh as good food!
    In February and March, people starve to death and are put in coffins,
    In May and June, they starve to death and no one buries them.
    Grain rots everywhere in the cellars,
    Landlord Cui can't finish eating his grain.
    The poor are hungry like stray dogs,
    Landlord Cui is so heartless he won't save them!
    The wind blows and the big trees rustle,
    Landlord Cui has money and is a Baochang (local security head).
    An abacus with ninety-one beads,
    Landlord Cui can't count his cattle and sheep.
    Thirty li of grassland and twenty li of sand,
    Doesn't that herd of cattle and sheep belong to his family?
    Smoke billows from the cave,
    Landlord Cui owns half the sky.
    Saying a word in front of the county magistrate,
    The wind and rain are all up to him.
    The colder the weather, the tighter the wind,
    The richer people are, the crueler their hearts!
    In the 18th year, no crops were harvested,
    The villagers frown.
    No grain to eat,
    Landlord Cui's rent is hard to pay back.
    It's better to go hungry,
    Than to fall short on rent and lose your life!
    Wang Mazi hasn't seen a grain of rice in three days,
    Landlord Cui's lackeys come to demand it.
    His tongue flails in his mouth,
    Wang Mazi says all the good things.
    "If I can't pay back the rent, I still have a life,
    If I can't pay it back in this life, I'll be your animal in the next."
    "Short rent, short money, short grain—
    Old dog, do you want to resist with your life?"
    One sentence comes with three glares,
    Three sentences come with a horsewhip!
    The lackeys are like wolves and tigers,
    Fifty-year-old Wang Mazi suffers.
    His body is beaten until it bleeds,
    Calling for his mother incessantly.
    A lone goose loses its flock and lands in the sand,
    The neighbors feel bad watching.
    "Wear a fur coat in winter to avoid the wind,
    Wang Mazi is short on grain, not on your life."
    "Houses and property are yours to pick,
    Even if you beat me to death, the rent can't be paid!"
    The donkey bumps into the haystack without eyes,
    The lackeys have no conscience!
    One stick breaks and another is replaced,
    White falls and red rises, unbearable to watch!
    The sun is setting and there's still a breath left,
    The moon rises to shine on the corpse.
    Pulling up yellow蒿 even with its roots,
    Landlord Cui is too ruthless!
    Beating the old man to death and taking the child away,
    The family is left with nothing!
    Grass and trees don't sprout in winter,
    In the old society, villagers are not as good as cattle and horses!
    2. Wang Gui Takes on Work
    Wang Mazi's child is called Wang Gui,
    Not too big, not too small, thirteen years old.
    Landlord Cui has good plans,
    To raise a lifelong un-paid laborer to always use.
    Consider him a son, not a big deal for the boss,
    Count him as a laborer without spending money.
    The lamb bleats when it lands,
    Wang Gui knows everything even though he's young.
    Cattle and donkeys suffer but are fed grass,
    Wang Gui is never full in all seasons.
    On New Year's Day, dumplings fill the pot,
    Wang Gui still gnaws on cornmeal buns.
    He wears winter clothes but has no summer clothes,
    In June, he wears an old sheepskin inside out.
    In autumn, he harvests crops with a sickle,
    Even if his palms are worn out, they say he's slow.
    In winter, Wang Gui goes to herd sheep,
    He doesn't have good clothes to wear.
    His hands and feet are frozen and bleed,
    The dry food is frozen hard.
    He wants to pull firewood to start a fire,
    But the firewood under the snow can't be lit.
    The horse orchid blooms with five petals,
    Wang Gui has been a laborer for four years.
    If the snow is heavy in winter, the wheat will be good next year,
    Wang Gui is like a wheat seedling.
    In the dead of winter, the snow falls chaotically,
    Wang Gui thinks of his father.
    If the old cow dies, replace it with a young one,
    The deep hatred of killing the father must be avenged by the son!
    3. Li Xiangxiang
    The lark sings, the lark lays eggs,
    Landlord Cui's family lives in Dead Sheep Bay.
    When the river rises, it's hard to tell the clear from the muddy,
    In Dead Sheep Bay, there are rich people and poor people.
    There is a stream in the front gully of Dead Sheep Bay,
    There is a poor old man, Li Derui.
    White-bearded Li Derui is fifty-eight,
    He only has one flower at home.
    His daughter's name is Li Xiangxiang,
    She has no brothers, and her mother is dead.
    A molting sparrow spends the winter,
    Without food or clothing.
    Sixteen-year-old Xiangxiang is as strong as an ox,
    She works herself to death but can't get enough to eat.
    Lamb's stomach towel wrapped in rock candy,
    Although poor, she has a good heart.
    Each kernel of corn is fresh,
    Old Man Li is old but has a soft heart.
    He often holds Wang Gui's hand,
    Tears streaming down his face, saying: "Child, you're unlucky!
    "Young and burdened with heavy burdens,
    No mother, no family, all alone.
    "Beggars live in Guanye Temple,
    Consider this place your home."
    When the wind and rain keep people idle,
    Wang Gui comes to chop firewood.
    One sister, one big family,
    The homeless child has found a home.
    4. Digging Bitter Herbs
    The Mountain Red Lily blooms beautifully,
    Xiangxiang is a good-looking person!
    A pair of big eyes, watery,
    Like dew drops on the grass.
    Millet ground three times,
    Xiangxiang has loved farmers since she was a child.
    Green shrubs on the ground,
    Wang Gui is a good worker!
    Five feet tall, full of strength,
    He's worth two people in the farmland.
    Corn blooms halfway up the stalk,
    Wang Gui has long taken a liking to Xiangxiang.
    Small tunes are easy to sing, but hard to open your mouth,
    Cherries are delicious to eat, but hard to plant.
    Both of them have good feelings for each other,
    But both are too shy to speak.
    Wang Gui drives the sheep up the mountain,
    Xiangxiang is digging bitter herbs in the depression.
    Driving the sheep and whistling,
    A song comes out:
    "Suffering all day doesn't make me sleepy,
    I can't close my eyes, I miss my sister."
    Stopping and steadying himself,
    The sound in the depression is small, like playing a zither:
    "Mountain Red Lily blooms in the back depression,
    Take your time with those thoughts."
    "The ganoderma grass by the roadside,
    No one is better than my sister!"
    "Picking horses from horses, they're not all the same height,
    Picking people from people, my brother is the best!"
    "Cherry mouth, glutinous rice teeth,
    Clever mouth saying flattering words.
    "Marrying a rich man means constant spending,
    Why suffer with a laborer like me?!"
    "The tobacco pipe lights up half the kang,
    The wine cup measures rice, not minding that my brother is poor.
    "Sister was born loving farmers,
    Sincerity is better than money."
    "Red-fleshed watermelon with green skin,
    I won't forget what my sister said."
    "The words in my belly are as chaotic as hemp,
    Set a time to talk heart-to-heart."
    "When the night is dark and quiet, and people are asleep,
    Pull up the words in my sister's room.
    "The sky is full of stars, no moon,
    Be careful not to step on the dog!"
    5. Two Silver Dollars
    The setting sun is red and bright,
    Xiangxiang carries water to the well.
    The rope is too short to draw water from the well,
    Xiangxiang bends over, gasping for breath.
    A black serge mandarin jacket, satin shoes,
    Landlord Cui comes to the depression.
    A head like a yam,
    Two rat eyes smiling into slits.
    Opening his mouth, you see big yellow teeth,
    He reaches out and pinches Xiangxiang.
    "You can't lift it, let me help you,
    How can you ruin your embroidered hands!"
    "Landlord Cui, be polite,
    What are you doing with your hands and feet?!"
    "Little darling, don't be angry,
    I've wanted to get to know you for a long time."
    "Rice and mutton soup,
    I've had my eye on you for a long time."
    "Marry me and it will be more convenient,
    You can pick what you want to eat and wear."
    Xiangxiang is angry and shy,
    She carries the water bucket and walks back.
    Landlord Cui follows closely behind,
    Taking out two silver dollars from his waist.
    "I'll give you two big silver dollars,
    Take them and buy two pieces of fancy clothing."
    Xiangxiang's temperament is naturally impatient,
    She has hated the rich since she was a child.
    First, she hates that the family can't get enough to eat—
    The harvested grain is handed over as rent;
    Second, she hates Wang Gui working for him—
    Working day and night like an animal.
    Her face is as red as a pomegranate flower:
    "What do I want your dirty money for?"
    "You ignorant girl, don't know what's good for you,
    If you anger me, you won't be able to bear it!"
    A scolded dog lowers its head and walks along the wall,
    Landlord Cui's jealousy hasn't subsided.
    "If the well rope breaks and the bucket falls into the well,
    You'll never escape my grasp.
    "You leave the white flour and eat @@,
    You like Wang Gui and don't like me?!
    "Wang Gui is young and a pauper,
    I may be old, but I have money.
    "Sifting flour in a copper sieve, it falls into the flour box,
    Wang Gui's life is in my hands.
    "Rolling cigarettes in a cave, ashes on the roof beam,
    I'll go back and make that kid suffer for two days!"
    Part Two
    (1) Making Revolution
    There are few trees and stones in Sanbian,
    Villagers can't make a living.
    No clouds in the sky, drought on the ground,
    If you can't make a living, make other plans.
    Sheep walk by following the lead sheep,
    The Communist Party rose up in northern Shaanxi.
    First name Lao Liu, second name Gao Gang,
    The red flag is planted halfway in the sky.
    A spark falls on a haystack, causing a big fire,
    When the red flag is unfurled, the poor are all red.
    Thousands of miles of thunder, thousands of miles of lightning,
    The fast horse spread red all over.
    Purple ＠ ox brings its own plow,
    Everyone has the thought of making revolution.
    In the morning, he's still a farmer,
    In the dark, he carries a gun to fight in the barracks.
    Open the stockade and divide the grain,
    Distribute the land, cattle, and sheep evenly.
    Young Pioneers and militia,
    Are all eighteen or nineteen-year-old young people.
    Women walk like the wind,
    Long hair cut into short tassels.
    The river rises upstream and is muddy downstream,
    Wang Gui secretly joined the militia.
    He grazes sheep in the shallows during the day,
    Attends meetings at night to make revolution.
    After the meeting, the rooster crows,
    He runs back for more than ten li.
    Grazing sheep all day long,
    Not @@ eyes at night.
    The body is tired, but the spirit is good,
    The enthusiasm for making revolution is very high.
    Five fingers are not the same length,
    Wang Gui's thoughts are different from others.
    Other people's hatred is like a mountain,
    Wang Gui's hatred is higher than the sky:
    Beating his father to death,
    Now he wants to snatch the person in his heart!
    He worked as a cattle and horse for five years,
    Landlord Cui has never given him a penny in wages.
    Landlord Cui is messing around,
    Building a stockade, buying horses, and recruiting soldiers.
    Landlords and gentry are all fierce,
    Landlord Cui is a big bad guy!
    Villagers all want to eat his flesh,
    Even dogs hum when they see him.
    The crowd made suggestions to the guerrilla captain:
    Take down Dead Sheep Bay early.
    Don't be impatient and wait for the beans to cook thoroughly,
    A date is set: the twenty-third day of the twelfth lunar month.
    First catch Landlord Cui in the middle of the night,
    By dawn, the main force will enter Dead Sheep Bay.
    The plan is set, and people are busy,
    The day after tomorrow is the twenty-third.
    2. Will the Sun Rise from the West?
    If you hit a fox, the rabbits move,
    Hearing about the revolution, Landlord Cui is afraid.
    He doesn't sleep day or night,
    Wanting to block the Yellow River with a pile of walls.
    Investigating openly and visiting secretly,
    Finding out who followed the Communist Party?
    Hearing that Wang Gui was secretly making revolution,
    Landlord Cui's head burst with sparks.
    Returning from grazing sheep and just entering the door,
    Two hemp ropes bind his body.
    Tied along and across,
    He's tied up in a five-flower knot and hung on the second beam.
    The men and women of the whole village are called,
    To see what happens to those who make revolution!
    Two red willow sticks were broken in a row,
    He fainted and was sprayed with cold water.
    Sesame oil lights the lamp brightly,
    Wang Gui's whole body is stripped bare.
    Two hemp ropes bind his arms and legs,
    Tied into a duck floating upside down in the water.
    His face and body are covered in bloody welts,
    Like a skinned wild ox.
    Landlord Cui is fierce,
    Asking while whipping:
    "A toad wanting to eat swan meat,
    Can the poor make a big thing out of it!
    "Piss and look at your shadow,
    You ball-browed rat eyes can still become a spirit!
    "Will it snow in May and June?
    Will the sun rise from the west?"
    "Old dog, don't show off your power,
    Your dog's life is over in three days!
    "It doesn't matter if I die,
    Thousands of poor people follow behind."
    "Wang Gui, don't talk big,
    We're all one family after all.
    "The Cuis haven't treated you badly,
    Raising a monkey to become a grown man.
    "You tear down the bridge after crossing the river,
    Your wings are hard, and you've forgotten the favor.
    "A horse without hair becomes a dragon,
    Maybe you're just confused and didn't think it through?
    "A prodigal son who returns is worth more than gold,
    Put down the butcher knife and become an immortal.
    "I don't blame you for a thousand mistakes,
    I know that young people don't have control."
    "Old turtle, don't pour rice soup on me,
    I won't fall for your tricks, whether soft or hard.
    "The most unconscionable person in the world is you,
    Beating my father to death and treating me like an animal.
    "Suffering to death, working hard all year round,
    I haven't seen half a penny from you in five whole years.
    "In the middle of the night, when the livestock are eating grass,
    Old dog, you yell at me to get up.
    "No clothes, no bedding,
    Wearing your two old sheepskins for five years.
    "You eat rice and white flour,
    I eat a meal of yellow rice to celebrate the New Year.
    "One sentence comes with three glares,
    Getting whipped every other day.
    "You Cuis are raised by mothers,
    I, Wang Gui, was also pregnant in my mother's belly for ten months!
    "You're a person, and I'm a person too,
    Why are you so heartless?!
    "I, Wang Gui, may be poor, but my mind is bright,
    I have my own ideas about things.
    "If the revolution succeeds, I'll turn over;
    If I don't make revolution, I won't live long either.
    "A flea jumps with all its might without dying,
    I don't care if I live or die, it's just my life.
    "Kill me or scrape me, you choose,
    I know your tricks:
    "If hard methods don't work, you'll use soft methods,
    Wanting me to obey you and ruin my conscience.
    "Put away your tricks early,
    It's hard for me to be a dog!"
    Landlord Cui is ashamed and angry,
    He tears his old face and jumps three feet high.
    "A dog biting dung, you're not a person to be respected,
    You don't listen to good words, and you even scold people!"
    Saying the word "beat," the whip rains down,
    Wang Gui is in so much pain that he clenches his teeth.
    A gust of yellow wind, a gust of sand,
    Xiangxiang's heart aches like a knife watching.
    Shivering and numb,
    Beating Wang Gui is like beating her.
    Her face turns red and then white,
    Tears welling up, afraid to drip down.
    Her ears are burning, her whole body is numb,
    Like a dead child.
    Thinking of a good way to save her loved one,
    She secretly ran out of the gate.
    Walking and thinking:
    "Wang Gui's life is tonight.
    "He often goes to Zhangjia to attend meetings,
    The guerrillas should live there!
    "Hurry, send a letter,
    If I'm late, my loved one will be in danger!"

　　王贵与李香香
    ——陕甘宁边区民间革命历史故事
    李季
    第一部
    １崔二爷收租
    中华民国十九年，
    有一件伤心事，出在三边。
    人人都说三边有三宝，
    穷人多来富人少。
    一眼望不尽的老黄沙，
    那块地不属财主家？
    民国十八年雨水少，
    庄稼就像炭火烤。
    瞎子摸黑路难上难，
    穷汉们就怕闹荒年。
    荒年怕尾不怕头，
    十九年春荒人人愁。
    掏完了苦菜上树梢，
    遍地不见绿苗苗。
    坟堆里挖骨磨面面，
    娘煮儿肉当好饭！
    二三月饿死人装棺材，
    五六月饿死没人埋。
    窖里粮食霉个遍，
    崔二爷粮食吃不完。
    穷汉们饿的像只丧家狗，
    崔二爷狠心见死他不救！
    风吹大树嘶啦啦的响，
    崔二爷有钱当保长。
    一个算盘九十一颗珠，
    崔二爷牛羊没有数数。
    三十里草地二十里沙，
    那一群牛羊不属他家？
    烟洞里冒烟飞满天，
    崔二爷他有半个天。
    县长跟前说上一句话，
    刮风下雨都由他。
    天气越冷风越紧，
    人越有钱心越狠！
    十八年庄稼没有收，
    庄户人家皱眉头。
    打不下粮食吃不成饭，
    崔二爷的租子也难还。
    饿着肚子还好过，
    短下租子命难活！
    王麻子  三天  没见一颗米，
    崔二爷的  狗腿子来  催逼。
    舌头在嘴里乱打转，
    王麻子把好放都说完。
    “还不起租子，我还有一条命，
    这辈子还不起，来世给你当牲灵。”
    “短租子、短钱、短下粮——
    老狗你莫非想拿命来抗？”
    一句话来三瞪眼，
    三句话来一马鞭！
    狗腿子像狼又像虎
    五十岁的  王麻子  受了苦。
    混身打烂血直淌，
    连声不断叫亲娘。
    孤雁失群落沙窝，
    邻居们看着也难过。
    “冬天穿皮袄为避风，
    王麻子短租谷，不短你的命。”
    “房子家产由你们挑，
    打死我  租子也  交不了！”
    毛驴撞草垛没有长眼，
    狗腿子不长人心肝！
    一根棍断了又一根换，
    白落红起不忍心看！
    太阳偏西还有一口气，
    月亮上来照死尸。
    拔起黄蒿还带根，
    崔二爷做事太狠心！
    打死老子拉走娃娃，
    一家人落了个光踏踏！
    冬天里草木不长芽，
    旧社会的庄户人不如牛马！
    ２王贵揽工
    王麻子的娃娃叫王贵，
    不大不小十三岁。
    崔二爷来好打算，
    养下个  没头长工  常使唤。
    算个儿子  掌柜的  不是大，
    顶上个  揽工的不  把钱花。
    羊羔子落地咩咩叫，
    王贵虽小啥事都知道。
    牛驴受苦喂草料，
    王贵四季吃不饱。
    大年初饺子下满锅，
    王贵还啃糠窝窝。
    穿了冬衣没夏衣，
    六月天翻穿老羊皮。
    秋天收庄稼一张镰，
    磨破了手心还说慢。
    冬天王贵去放羊，
    身上没有好衣裳。
    脚手冻烂血直淌，
    干粮冻得硬梆梆。
    心想拔柴放火烤，
    雪下的柴儿点不着了。
    马兰开花五个瓣瓣，
    王贵揽工整四年。
    冬里雪大来年麦好，
    王贵就像麦苗苗。
    十冬腊月雪乱下，
    王贵想起他亲大。
    老牛死了换上牛不老，
    杀父深仇要子报！
    ３李香香
    百灵子雀雀百灵子蛋，
    崔二爷家住死羊湾。
    大河里涨水清混不分，
    死羊湾有财  主也  有穷人。
    死羊湾  前沟里有  一条水，
    有一个穷老汉李德瑞。
    白胡子李德瑞五十八，
    家里只有一枝花。
    女儿名叫李香香，
    没有兄弟死了娘。
    脱毛雀雀过冬天，
    没有吃来没有穿。
    十六岁的香香顶上  牛一条，
    累死挣活吃不饱。
    羊肚子手巾包冰糖，
    虽然人穷好心肠。
    玉米结子颗颗鲜，
    李老汉年老心肠软。
    时常拉着王贵的手，
    两眼流泪  说：“娃命苦！
    “年岁小来苦头重，
    没娘没大孤零零。
    “讨吃子住在关爷庙，
    我这里就算你的家。”
    刮风下雨人闲下，
    王贵就来把柴打。
    一个妹子一个大，
    没家的人儿找到了家。
    ４掏苦菜
    山丹丹开花红姣姣，
    香香人材长的好！
    一对大眼水汪汪，
    就像那露  水珠  在草淌上。
    二道糜子碾三遍，
    香香自小就爱庄稼汉。
    地头上沙柳绿蓁蓁，
    王贵是个好手生！
    身高五尺混身都是劲，
    庄稼地里顶两人。
    玉米开花半中腰，
    王贵早把香香看中了。
    小曲好唱口难开，
    樱桃好吃树难栽。
    交好的心思两人都有，
    谁也害臊难开口。
    王贵赶羊上山来，
    香香在洼里掏苦菜。
    赶着羊群打口哨，
    一句曲儿出口了：
    “受苦一天不瞌睡，
    合不上眼睛我  想  妹妹。”
    停下脚步定一定神，
    洼洼里声小像弹琴：
    “山丹丹  花来背  洼洼开，
    有那些心思慢慢来。”
    “大路畔上的灵芝草，
    谁也没有妹妹好！”
    “马里头  挑马不  一般高，
    人里头挑  人数哥  哥好！”
    “樱桃小口糯米牙，
    巧口口说些哄人话。
    “交上个有钱的花钱常不断，
    为啥要跟我这揽工的受可怜？！”
    “烟锅锅点  灯半  炕炕明，
    酒盅盅  量米不  嫌哥哥穷。
    “妹妹生来就爱庄稼汉，
    实心实意赛过银钱。”
    “红瓢子西瓜绿皮包，
    妹妹的话儿我忘不了。”
    “肚里的话儿乱如麻，
    定下个时候，说说知心话。”
    “天黑夜静人睡下，
    妹妹房里把话拉。
    “满天的星星没月亮，
    小心踏在狗身上！”
    ５两块洋钱
    太阳落山红艳艳，
    香香担水上井畔。
    井里打水斗绳绳短，
    香香弯腰气直喘。
    黑呢子马褂缎子鞋，
    洼洼里来了崔二爷。
    一颗脑袋像个山药蛋，
    两颗鼠眼笑成一条线。
    张开嘴了见大黄牙，
    顺手把香香捏了一把。
    “你提不动我来帮你提，
    绣花手磨坏怎个哩！”
    “崔二爷你守规矩，
    毛手毛脚干啥哩？！”
    “小娇娇你不要恼，
    二爷早有心和你交。”
    “大米干饭羊腥汤，
    主意早打在你身上。”
    “交了二爷多方便，
    吃喝穿戴由你拣。”
    香香又气又害羞，
    担上水桶往回走。
    崔二爷紧跟在后边，
    腰里摸出来两块钱。
    “二爷给你两块大白洋，
    拿去扯两件花衣裳。”
    香香的性子本来躁，
    自幼就把有钱人恨透了。
    一恨一家吃不饱——
    打下的粮食交租了；
    二恨王贵给他揽工——
    没明没夜当牲灵。
    脸儿红似石榴花：
    “谁要你脏钱干什吗？”
    “死了头你不要不识好，
    惹恼了二爷你受不了！”
    挨骂狗低头顺着墙根走，
    崔二爷的醋瘾没有过够。
    “井绳断了桶掉井里头，
    终久脱不过我的手。
    “放着白面你吃＠＠，
    看上王贵你看不上我？！
    “王贵年青是个穷光蛋，
    二爷我虽老有银钱。
    “铜箩里筛面落面箱，
    王贵的命儿在我手上。
    “烟洞里卷烟房梁上灰，
    我回去叫他小子受两天罪！”
    第二部
    （１）闹革命
    三边没树石头少，
    庄户人的日子过不了。
    天上无云地下旱，
    过不了日子另打算。
    羊群走路靠头羊，
    陕北起了共产党。
    头名老刘，二名高岗，
    红旗插在半天上。
    草堆上落火星大火烧，
    红旗一展穷人都红了。
    千里的雷声万里的闪，
    快哩马撒红了个遍。
    紫红＠牛自带耧，
    闹革命的心思人人有。
    前半晌还是个庄稼汉，
    到黑里背枪打营盘。
    打开寨子分粮食，
    土地牛羊分个光。
    少先队来赤卫军，
    净是些十八九的年轻人。
    女人们走路一阵风，
    长头发剪成短缨缨。
    上河里涨水下河里浑，
    王贵暗里参加了赤卫军。
    白天到滩里去放羊，
    黑夜里开会闹革命。
    开罢会来鸡子叫，
    十几里路往回跑。
    白天放羊一整天，
    黑夜不＠一＠眼。
    身子劳碌精神好，
    闹革命的心劲一满高。
    手指头五个不一般长，
    王贵的心思和人不一样。
    别人的仇恨像座山，
    王贵的仇恨比天高：
    活活打死老父亲，
    迩刻又要抢心上的人！
    牛马当了整五年，
    崔二爷没给过一个工钱。
    崔二爷来胡日弄，
    修寨子买马又招兵。
    地主豪绅个个凶，
    崔二爷是个大坏蛋！
    庄户人个个想吃他的肉，
    狗儿见他也哼几哼。
    众人向游击队长提意见：
    早早的打下死羊湾。
    心急等不得豆煮烂，
    定下个日子：腊月廿三。
    半夜先捉定崔二爷，
    到天明大队开进死羊湾。
    定下计划人忙乱，
    后天就是二十三。
    ２太阳会从西边出来吗？
    打着了狐子兔子搬家，
    听见闹革命  崔二爷  心害怕。
    白天夜晚不瞌睡，
    一垛墙想堵黄河水。
    明里查来暗里访，
    打听说谁个随了共产党？
    听说王贵暗黑闹革命，
    崔二爷头上冒火星。
    放羊回来刚进门，
    两条麻绳捆上身。
    顺着捆来横着绑，
    五花大绑吊在二梁上。
    全庄的男女都叫上，
    都来看闹革命的啥下场！
    连着打断了两根红柳棍，
    昏死过去又拿冷水喷。
    麻油点灯灯花亮，
    王贵浑身扒了个光。
    两根麻绳捆着胳膊腿，
    捆成个鸭子倒浮水。
    满脸混身血道道，
    活像个剥了皮的牛不老。
    崔二爷来气凶凶，
    打一皮鞭问一声：
    “癞蛤蟆想吃天鹅肉，
    穷鬼们还能  闹成个  大事情！
    “撒泡尿来照照你的影，
    球眉鼠眼还会成了精！
    “五黄六月会飘雪花？
    太阳会从西边出来吗？”
    “老狗日你不要耍威风，
    不过三天要你狗命！
    “我一个死了不要紧，
    千万个穷汉后面跟。”
    “王贵你不要说大话，
    说来说去咱们是一家。
    “姓崔的没有亏待过你，
    猴娃娃养成大后生。
    “过罢河来你拆了桥，
    翅膀硬了你忘了恩。
    “马无毛病成了龙，
    该是你一时糊涂没想通？
    “浪子回头金不换，
    放下杀猪刀成神仙。
    “千错万错我不怪你，
    年轻人没把  握我知  道哩。”
    “老王八你不要灌米汤，
    又软又硬我不上你的当。
    “世上没良心的就数你，
    打死我亲大，把我当牲灵。
    “苦死苦活一年到头干，
    整整五年没见你半个钱。
    “五更半夜牲口正吃草，
    老狗日你就把我吼叫起来了。
    “没有衣裳没有被，
    五年穿你两件老羊皮。
    “你吃的大米和白面，
    我吃顿黄米当过年。
    “一句话来三瞪眼，
    三天两头挨皮鞭。
    “姓崔的你是娘老子养，
    我王贵娘肚里也怀了十个月胎！
    “你是人来我也是个人，
    为啥你这样没良心？！
    “我王贵难穷心眼亮，
    自己的事情有主张。
    “闹革命成功我翻身了；
    不闹革命我也活不长。
    “跳蚤不死一股劲的跳，
    管他死活  就是我这  命一条。
    “要杀要刮由你挑，
    你的鬼心眼我知道：
    “硬办法不成软办法来，
    想叫我顺了你把良心坏。
    “趁早收起你那鬼算盘，
    想叫我当狗难上难！”
    崔二爷又羞又气恼，
    撕破了老脸，一跳三  尺高。
    “狗咬巴屎你不是人敬的
    好话不听你还骂人哩！”
    说个“打”字，皮鞭如雨下，
    疼的王贵紧咬着牙。
    一阵阵黄风一阵沙，
    香香看着心上如刀扎。
    一阵阵打颤一阵阵麻，
    打王贵就像打着了她。
    脸皮发红又发白，
    眼泪珠噙着不敢滴下来。
    两耳发烧混身麻，
    活像一个死娃娃。
    为救亲人想的办法好，
    偷偷的跑出了大门道。
    一边走来一边想：
    “王贵的命儿就在今晚上。
    “他常到张家圪＠去开会，
    那里该住着游击队！
    “快走快跑把信送，
    迟一步亲人就难活命！”
