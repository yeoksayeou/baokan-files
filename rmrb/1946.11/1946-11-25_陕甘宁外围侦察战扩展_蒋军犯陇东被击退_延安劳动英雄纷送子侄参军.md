Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 22nd—Chiang Kai-shek's army's reconnaissance war of aggression against the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region has expanded from the southern, northern, and northwestern fronts to the southwestern eastern Gansu region. Several dozen Chiang Kai-shek troops near Xifeng Town, bordering eastern Gansu, harassed the Qingyang border on the 15th and were repelled by local militia. On the southern front, a unit of the 127th Brigade of the 36th Division of Hu Zongnan's 29th Army of Chiang Kai-shek's troops in Yaoxian County fired more than ten shells at the Wuwang Mountain area of the Border Region on the 18th.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 22nd—Yan'an labor hero Liu Yuyun's entire family is mobilizing in preparation for the self-defense war. His son has already joined the backbone self-defense army and has been learning to shoot and throw grenades in recent days. The women in the family are dividing the work at home to make shoes for the Eighth Route Army, with the daughter-in-law stitching the soles and the daughter sewing the uppers. Labor hero Wu Manyou personally sent his son Zhonggui to join the Eighth Route Army a few days ago. Model cooperative chairman Liu Jianzhang also persuaded his nephew Dahai to join the army, and his nephew registered with the township government a few days ago.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 22nd—Chiang Kai-shek's planes have continuously harassed Dingbian in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region for days, strafing peaceful farmers. These bloody facts completely expose Peng Xuepei's deceptive lies that "airplanes are landing in Yan'an and flying to Yu Cai."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th—The Women's Federation of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region protests against American planes equipping Chiang Kai-shek's army and American-made Chiang Kai-shek planes preparing to attack and frequently reconnoitering the Border Region. It specifically calls on American sisters on behalf of 750,000 women in the region to take all measures to stop the American government from aiding Chiang Kai-shek and withdrawing American troops stationed in China.

　　陕甘宁外围侦察战扩展
    蒋军犯陇东被击退
    延安劳动英雄纷送子侄参军
    【新华社延安二十二日电】蒋介石军进攻陕甘宁边区的侦察战，已由南线、北线、西北扩展到西南部陇东地区。陇东邻境西峰镇附近蒋军数十人，于十五日向庆阳边境骚扰，被当地民兵击退。南线方面，耀县蒋军胡宗南部二十九军三十六师一二七旅一部，于十八日向边区武王山地区发炮十余发。
    【新华社延安二十二日电】延安劳动英雄刘雨云全家进行准备自卫战的动员，其子已参加基干自卫军，日来学打枪、投弹。妇女在家分工给八路军做鞋，媳妇纳底，女儿纳帮。劳动英雄吴满有日前亲送其子仲贵参加八路军。模范合作社主席刘建章亦劝其侄大海参军，其侄已于日前在乡政府报名。
    【新华社延安二十二日电】蒋机连日不断袭扰陕甘宁边区之定边，扫射和平农民。这些血腥事实，完全揭穿了彭学沛的所谓“飞机是降落延安和飞往榆材”的骗人谰言。
    【新华社延安二十日电】陕甘宁边区妇联会抗议美机装备蒋军及美制蒋机准备进攻及频繁侦察边区，特代表全区七十五万妇女呼吁美国姊妹，采取一切办法，停止美政府援蒋撤退驻华美军。
