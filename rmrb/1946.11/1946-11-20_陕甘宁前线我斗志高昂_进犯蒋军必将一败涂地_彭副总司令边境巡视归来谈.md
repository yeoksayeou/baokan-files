Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th. Deputy Commander-in-Chief Peng, upon returning from an inspection of the border area of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, told reporters with great certainty: This time, we are bound to win in defending the border region and Yan'an. Deputy Commander-in-Chief Peng said: The border region was built from a few broken rifles by comrades such as Liu Zhidan and Gao Gang. They were able to defeat the enemy even then. Recalling the situation when Chiang Kai-shek "encircled and suppressed" the Red Army after the Long March to northern Shaanxi in 1935, he said: At that time, the base area had only 300,000 people, and the Red Army had only 10,000 soldiers, and they were exhausted after the Long March. Each soldier had only two to five bullets, while Chiang Kai-shek's "encircling and suppressing" troops consisted of nine divisions of the Northeast Army, and more than 50 regiments, totaling over 100,000 troops, from Yan Xishan, Ma Hongda, Gao Shuangcheng, Gao Guizi, and other units, attacking us from all directions. Our army was still able to smash the enemy's "encirclement and suppression." In the battle of Zhiluozhen in ＠ County, the 109th Division was wiped out. Now our situation is very different. The base area is seven or eight times larger than before, the population is five times greater, there are no enemies to the east relying on the Yellow River, and there is the Fifth Division of southern Shaanxi echoing us in the south. Hu Zongnan's attacking force can only be eight brigades, and Ma Hongda has three brigades. Hu Zongnan has recently airlifted some troops to the Yulin area, but they do not have much attacking power, so at most, they will not exceed the attacking force of the 1935 "encirclement and suppression." Hu Zongnan is a defeated general. In 1936, the border region army wiped out one of his divisions at Shanchengbu. Recently, three brigades of his troops were wiped out by General Chen Geng's troops in southern Shanxi, including his most elite First Brigade. After ten years of construction in the border region, the military and civilians are united, the army is strong, and the supplies are abundant. Furthermore, we have the help of the entire North China base areas. How can we not win such a battle? Deputy Commander-in-Chief Peng said: As long as everyone works hard and resolutely fights, we can achieve astonishing victories in defending the border region and Yan'an, and utterly defeat Hu Zongnan's invading army. Deputy Commander-in-Chief Peng emphasized the work of clearing the fields and called on everyone to do this work well, not leaving a single grain for Hu Zongnan, which would greatly increase the certainty of victory and shorten the time until victory arrives. He pointed out: The border region has had plenty of food and clothing in recent years, and everyone has a lot of grain stored. It is necessary to mobilize every household to bury the grain in multiple places, and neighboring villages should organize mutual inspections to ensure that the burial locations cannot be found before it is considered successful. He highly praised the high morale of the front-line troops and the enthusiasm of the militia in various places in manufacturing and learning to use landmines.

    陕甘宁前线我斗志高昂
    进犯蒋军必将一败涂地
    彭副总司令边境巡视归来谈
    【新华社延安十七日电】彭副总司令往陕甘宁边区边境视察归来，以十分肯定的语气对记者说：此次保卫边区、保卫延安，我军是必胜的。彭副总司令说：边区是刘志丹、高岗等同志从几根烂枪创立起来的，他们那时都能打胜敌人。他回忆一九三五年红军长征到陕北后蒋介石“围剿”的情形说：那时的根据地只有三十万人口，红军只有一万人，而且刚才经过长征，疲劳不堪，每个战士只有子弹两颗到五颗，而蒋介石的“围剿”军队则有东北军九个师，和阎锡山、马鸿达、高双成、高桂滋等各部共计五十多个团十万人以上，四面八方向我进攻，我军仍能粉碎敌人的“围剿”。在＠县直罗镇一战，就消灭了一○九师。现在我们的情形大不相同，根据地比以前大了七八倍，人口多了五倍，东面靠黄河没有敌人，南面还有陕南第五师互相呼应，胡宗南的攻击力量只能有八个旅，马鸿达三个旅，榆林方面胡宗南最近空运了些部队去，但是没有多大力量进攻的，故至多不会超过一九三五年“围剿”的进攻兵力。胡宗南是败将，一九三六年边区军队在山城堡消灭过他的一个师，最近在晋南被我陈赓将军所部消灭三个旅，连他最精锐的第一旅也消灭了。边区经过十年建设，军民团结，兵强马壮，物资丰富，并且有整个华北各根据地的帮助，这样还能不打胜仗吗？彭副总司令说：只要大家努力，大家坚决的打，保卫边区和延安可以取得惊人的胜利，可以使胡宗南进犯军一败涂地。彭副总司令着重的说到坚壁清野的工作后，号召大家把这件事做好，不给胡宗南留下一颗粮，这就会大大的增加胜利的把握和缩短胜利到来的时间。他指出：边区这几年丰衣足食，大家存粮甚多，必须每家每户动员起来，把粮食分开多处埋藏，邻村组织互相检查，做到找不到埋藏所在才算成功。他对于前线军队斗志的高昂，各地民兵制造和学习使用地雷的热烈，极其赞扬。
