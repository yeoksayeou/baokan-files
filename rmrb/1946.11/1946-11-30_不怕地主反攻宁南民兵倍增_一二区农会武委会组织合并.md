　　【This Newspaper Weixian 25th Dispatch】To safeguard their victorious gains and prevent landlords' conspiracies for counterattacks, the peasants of Ningnan are actively joining the militia in various villages. In District One, membership has grown from 533 before the mass movement to 923; in District Two, from 575 before the mass movement to 1,295. In the three towns of Dongwang, it has grown from 112 to 319; in Zhao Village, from 62 to 90, accounting for more than 7% of the village population; in Da Cao Village, from 90 to 183; in Xin Village, from 24 to 53; and in Wang Li Village, from 12 to 21. The methods of development are: individual brewing and mobilization after the movement, proposing that good members should join the militia to defend their own fruits; calling for participation at the celebration of emancipation rallies; individual review and approval by the Agricultural Association. After development, organization and education are carried out, setting their own discipline, introspection, and oath-taking, proposing that the militia is the armed force of the Agricultural Association, protecting the peasants. In order to strengthen the militia organization and leadership, the Military Committee decided to merge the Military Committees and Agricultural Associations of Districts One and Two. The director of the Military Committee is the deputy director of the Agricultural Association or the armed committee member, the director of the village Agricultural Association concurrently serves as the director of the Military Committee, the public security officer is the deputy director, and the militia captain, self-defense captain, and instructor are members. Thorough cleansing is carried out for individual bad elements such as former puppet soldiers, bandits, ruffians, and those who were struggled against but have not repented. Guns are not allowed to be lent out and must have gun licenses or be branded to ensure that they are in the hands of reliable peasants.
