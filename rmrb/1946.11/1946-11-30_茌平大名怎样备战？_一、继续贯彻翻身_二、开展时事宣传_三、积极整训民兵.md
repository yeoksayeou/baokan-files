    Chiping and Daming's Preparations for War:
    I. Continue to Implement Land Reform
    II. Carry out Current Affairs Propaganda
    III. Actively Train Militias
    [Our Newspaper, Jilu Yu, 24th dispatch] Chiping news, October 30th, the entire county's Party, government, military, and civilian cadres held a meeting to deploy and study war preparations. Initially, everyone had confidence in the self-defense war and believed victory was assured, but they lacked confidence in guerrilla warfare, worrying about the possibility of their families being burned and killed. Each cadre initially considered their own personal interests. Later, during the discussion, everyone gradually became clear. Many cadres were preparing for guerrilla warfare, buying thread for quilt-making. Judging from their actions, most cadres went from "it doesn't matter" at the beginning to fear and anxiety, and then to determination to fight guerrilla warfare. The discussion continued on methods: (1) Combining land reform with war preparations; (2) Reviewing the composition of the militia to ensure they can be mobilized when needed; (3) Establishing county, district, sub-district, and village command posts, with cadres taking up guns to lead the fighting, and developing county and district core teams; (4) Universally conducting a "strong wind" propaganda offensive to suppress evil and establish righteousness, ensuring that reactionary public opinion receives the punishment it deserves, allowing the masses to understand the situation thoroughly and dare to be active and daring; (5) Starting from November 3rd, a county-wide ideological mobilization will begin, celebrating great victories, discussing mobile warfare, and reviewing the militia. After two days and nights of discussion, everyone's mood stabilized, they had solutions, and their confidence increased a hundredfold.
    [Our Newspaper, Weixian, 26th dispatch] Daming County's Party, government, military, and civilians held a county-wide cadre meeting on the 6th to discuss war preparations. The cadres at the meeting unanimously agreed that to get through the most difficult months, climb over the hill, and launch a counter-offensive, it is necessary to fully mobilize the masses, enabling them to completely transform themselves politically and economically, raise their class consciousness, and spontaneously organize to launch a guerrilla war against Chiang Kai-shek to defend their land. According to this spirit, the conference decided that the new district should launch ideological education through a thorough land reform review, breaking the cadres' and masses' peaceful thoughts, and making war preparations ideologically and organizationally. It is necessary to carefully reorganize and develop organizations, purge and reform the hooligans, puppet soldiers, and other bad elements in the militia, and carry out a mass anti-espionage movement so that honest farmers who have turned over can master weapons. The old district should consolidate existing organizations, develop them, and lay the foundation for future guerrilla warfare. County and district command posts and sub-district military committees will be established immediately, the county brigade will be expanded, and district guerrilla teams will be organized. Currently, the military committee is organizing militia in various districts to conduct grenade throwing, explosion, and other training. Daming Business has dispersed materials, carried out scorched earth tactics, and reorganized the militia organization. In Daming City, evil landlords and traitors were made to sign agreements with the liberated farmers, guaranteeing with their family's lives and property that they would not collude with Chiang Kai-shek. Many liberated militia members have joined the guerrilla隊to defend their fruits of victory.

　　茌平大名怎样备战？
    一、继续贯彻翻身
    二、开展时事宣传
    三、积极整训民兵
    【本报冀鲁豫二十四日电】茌平消息，十月卅日，全县党、政、军、民干部会上进行了备战工作的布置与研究，最初大家对自卫战争虽有信心，认为胜利是有把握的；但对打游击没有信心，担心着自己的家人被烧杀的可能，各个干部首先打个人的算盘。后来在讨论中大家逐渐明确了，有不少干部都有起游击战的准备，买起打被子的线绳来。从行动表现上来看，大部分干部是从开始的“没有关系”，到害怕、着急转到决心打游击了，接着又继续讨论了办法：（一）填平补齐与备战结合进行；（二）审查民兵成分，到时能把民兵集中起来；（三）建立县、区、小区、村的指挥部，干部都拿起枪来领导作战，发展县区基干队；（四）普遍进行“刮大风”的宣传攻势，镇压邪气，树立正气，使反动舆论受到应有的打击，使群众对形势能摸到底，敢于活跃起来敢干；（五）从十一月三日起即开始全县的思想动员，庆祝大胜利，讲运动战，检阅民兵等。经过两天两夜的讨论，大家情绪是稳定了，有了办法，信心百倍的增强了。
    【本报威县廿六日电】大名县党政军民于六日召开全县干部会议，讨论备战工作。到会干部一致认为要渡过最艰苦的几个月，爬过山头，进行反攻，必需充分发动群众，使群众从政治上经济上彻底翻身，提高阶级觉悟，自动的组织起来，向蒋介石展开保卫土地的游击战争；根据这一精神，大会决定新区应从翻身大检查中展开思想教育，打破干部和群众的和平思想，从思想上和组织上进行战争准备，慎重的整理与发展组织，清洗与改造民兵中的流氓、伪军等坏分子，开展群众性的反特运动，使翻身的老实农民掌握武装。老区应从巩固现有的组织，进行发展，打下将来开展游击战争的基础。县区即日成立指挥部和小区武委会，扩大县大队，组织区游击队，现武委会正组织各区民兵进行投弹、爆炸等训练。大名商已将物资疏散，进行空舍清野，整理民兵组织。大名市过去被恶霸汉奸正翻身农民具结，以全家生命财产作保，保证不勾结蒋贼，许多翻身民兵参加了游击队，以保卫胜利果实。
