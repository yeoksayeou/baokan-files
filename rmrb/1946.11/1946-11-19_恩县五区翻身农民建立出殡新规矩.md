    【This Newspaper, Weixian, 14th】After the masses in the Fifth District of En County were liberated, they voluntarily reformed the old funeral customs. In the past, funerals in each village were presided over by landlords. Even when poor people had funerals, they had to be held within three days. The filial sons had to kowtow and beg several times before the landlords would deign to make a decision. On the day of the funeral, there would be lavish eating and drinking, and a lot of noise. The landlords, dressed in long gowns, would strut around, issuing orders. All the strenuous and dirty work was done by the poor. Many poor people went bankrupt because of funerals. After the masses were liberated, through discussions by the Farmers' Association, it was unanimously agreed that this was a waste of resources and did not meet the needs of the war. It was decided that in the future, weddings and funerals would be handled by the Farmers' Association. New rules were established that were unanimously supported by the masses: (1) For funerals of poor peasants, no feasts, no purchase of ceremonial items, and no hiring of musicians; burial on the same day. (2) For funerals of middle peasants, only millet is provided for meals, ceremonial items are limited to no more than five, and musicians are limited to no more than five. Burial within three days. (3) For funerals of rich peasants, the body can be kept at home for no more than seven days, with meals and tobacco provided. The masses praised the new rules, saying, "The Farmers' Association is really in charge, always looking out for the poor!"

    恩县五区翻身农民建立出殡新规矩
    【本报威县十四日电】恩县五区群众翻身后，自动改造了旧的出殡规矩。过去各村有了丧事，都是由地主主持，穷人有了丧事，也得三天出殡。孝子磕头下拜几次，地主们才开恩作主。出殡的那天，大吃大喝，大闹一会。地主衣着大褂，耀武扬威，发号施令。所有用力的脏活，都是由穷人来干。穷人因出殡破产者不在少数。群众翻身后，经农会讨论，一致认为这样作是白浪费东西，又不合战争需要。决定今后婚丧大事，由农会负责办理。并定出群众一致拥护的新规矩：（一）贫农出殡不管吃，不买执事，不叫吹打的，当天埋。（二）中农只管吃小米，执事最多不超过五件。吹打的不超过五人。三天内出殡。（三）富农在家停灵最多不超过七天，管吃、管吸烟。群众称赞这个新规矩说：“农会真管事，处处为穷人打算盘！”
