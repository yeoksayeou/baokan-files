    Li Cheng Dongya Bottom Unified Filling
    Poor Peasants All Rise to Middle Peasants
    Neiqiu Old District Vigorously Carries Out Investigation and Reduction
    [Report from this newspaper] After more than twenty days of investigation and rent reduction movement, Dongya Bottom, the old district of Licheng, has achieved initial victory. At the beginning of the movement, the masses put forward the slogan "First speak out bitterness, then vent anger, then settle accounts and take things." After connecting and visiting the suffering, a large-scale movement of more than 450 people speaking out bitterness was launched. When the masses spoke of their pain, some cried loudly and demanded a thorough liquidation. The masses put forward "Return grain for grain, return rice for rice," and unanimously launched a general liquidation against seven households, including the tyrannical landlord Feng Baoyin, who continued to exploit the masses. More than 330 mu of land, more than 727,000 yuan in silver dollars, more than 130 houses, and a total of 20 mules, donkeys, and cattle were recovered. After unified filling and equitable distribution, 110 poor peasant households and 25 extremely poor peasant households all rose to become middle peasants. The average land per person increased from 0.9 mu to more than 2 mu. Yue Bao'an, an extremely poor peasant, had five people in his family. Before the movement, he did not have a single mu of land. This time, he was allocated 11 mu of good land, four houses, three sheep, and half a head of livestock. He said happily, "Rent reduction every year, I couldn't turn over every time. This year I can finally turn over!" (Ma Lin)
    [Report from this newspaper] The investigation and rent reduction movement in Baizhichuan and other villages in the old district of Neiqiu, which will finally and thoroughly defeat the feudal forces, has been vigorously launched. In the fourth district, all 41 administrative villages have 1,048 activists who have organized 138 turn-over groups, and a large-scale investigation and rent reduction movement is about to begin.
