　　Strictly Prevent Special Agent Activities
    Jinnan Administrative Office Issues Measures for Eliminating Traitors and Preventing Espionage
    [Our Newspaper, Weixian, 25th Dispatch] Chiang Kai-shek, in coordination with the large-scale invasion of our liberated areas, has dispatched a large number of special agents to infiltrate our mainland, spread rumors, disrupt public morale, and carry out assassinations and sabotage. The Jinnan Administrative Office has specifically decided on measures to prevent special agents and espionage, and has issued a notice for the entire region to implement. 1. Those going to Chiang-controlled areas must have a certificate from the county-level or higher public security bureau before being allowed to leave the territory; certificates from other organs, troops, or groups are invalid. 2. When the military, police, militiamen, and self-defense forces of the entire region are on guard duty, if they find anyone acting suspiciously or carrying prohibited items (reactionary documents... weapons, ammunition, and smuggled goods), they should send them along with all certificates to the public security organs above the district level for processing. 3. All party, government, military, and civilian organs and groups that have firearms personnel must have a gun permit. Those without gun permits will have both their personnel and firearms detained and handed over to local troops or public security organs for separate handling. 4. Personnel from party, government, military, and civilian organs and groups must carry the pass of their own organ when traveling; otherwise, passage is prohibited. All personnel who request leave to go home must carry the leave certificate of their own organ; otherwise, they will be treated as deserters. 5. People leaving a district or county must have a pass from the village and district; to go to a neighboring county, they must have a pass from the district and county government organs; otherwise, passage is strictly prohibited.
