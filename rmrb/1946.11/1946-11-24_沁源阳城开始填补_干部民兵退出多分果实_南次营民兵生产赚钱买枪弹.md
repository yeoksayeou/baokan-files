　　[This newspaper's Yangcheng dispatch from the 20th] In order to thoroughly realize "land to the tiller" in the old liberated areas of Qinshui and Yangcheng, the work of "filling the gaps and making up the differences" has begun. Comrade Li Weishi, Secretary of the Qinshui County Party Committee, personally went to Licheng Village last month to inspect the extent to which "land to the tiller" had been realized. He discovered that more than 20 households in the village had not yet been emancipated, while the cadres had obtained too many fruits of victory. He immediately convened a meeting of cadres to inspire them to conduct self-criticism. During the self-criticism, everyone further realized that the realization of "land to the tiller" meant that all peasants could be emancipated. The cadres then voluntarily withdrew 25 mu of land they had obtained in excess. The masses also criticized the cadres. After the cadres made self-criticisms or explanations one by one, the masses and cadres were further united. Now, they are actively promoting the filling of gaps and making up the differences. Since the end of September, when Yangcheng proposed implementing a one-time filling of gaps and making up the differences, the village governments and armed committees of Yanshan, Dianyao, Nanciying, and other villages have successively withdrawn the fruits of struggle they had retained and distributed them to peasants with no or little land. The Nanciying militia alone withdrew 31 mu of land. In the process of withdrawing, many places experienced fierce ideological struggles. The main issue was how to solve the problem of militia expenses (such as the lack of quilts for militia members on expeditions). The militia of a certain village in the Third District, for this reason, attempted to sell the fruits of victory privately to solve the problem. Although this was stopped, the militia's thinking was not clear. In response to this problem, the leadership proposed, "If you distribute this land to poor peasants, everyone will have land to cultivate, everyone will be well-off, and you won't have to worry about the militia not having quilts!" This immediately cleared everyone's minds. The leadership also introduced the typical example of the Nanciying militia solving expenses through production to everyone. In the year before last, the Nanciying militia collectively reclaimed six mu of wasteland. This spring, they reclaimed more than ten mu of wasteland. Together with the cultivated land, this year they harvested a total of 14 shi and 7 dou of millet, 17 shi of corn, 4 shi and 5 dou of beans, and 4 shi and 5 dou of sesame, with a net profit of 140 jin of cotton. Now, using this as capital, they have opened a flour mill, bought nine pigs, and are preparing to buy a machine gun with sesame and bullets with five shi of rice. All militia expenses are solved through production.

　　沁源阳城开始填补
    干部民兵退出多分果实
    南次营民兵生产赚钱买枪弹
    【本报阳城二十日电】沁源、阳城老区为彻底实现耕者有其田，已开始实行“填平补齐”。沁源县委李唯实同志于上月亲至李成＠检查耕者有其田实现的程度，发现该村尚有二十余户没翻身，而干部所得果实过多。当即召开干部会，启发大家自我检讨。检讨中，大家进一步认识了实现耕者有其田是要农民都能翻身，干部即自动退出多得的土地二十五亩，群众并向干部提出批评，经干部一一检讨或解释后，群众与干部进一步团结起来，现正积极推进填平补齐。阳城自九月底提出实行一次填平补齐后，岩山、殿腰、南次营等村政权、武委会已先后将保留的斗争果实退出，分给无地或少地的农民。仅南次营民兵即退出土地三十一亩。在退出过程中，许多地方曾经过激烈的思想斗争。其中主要的是民兵开支（如民兵出征没有被子）等问题如何解决。三区某村民兵为此问题，曾企图私卖果实来解决；后虽劝止了，但民兵思想不通。领导上针对这问题，提出“你将这些土地分给贫苦农民，大家都有了地种，都宽裕了，还愁民兵没被子盖？”这一下打通了大家的思想。领导上又将南次营民兵从生产中解决开支的典型例子介绍给大家。南次营民兵前年集体开荒六亩，今春开荒十余亩，加上熟地，今年共收谷十四石七斗、玉茭十七石、豆四石五斗、芝麻四石五斗，净花一百四十斤。现又以此为资本，开粉坊一座，买猪九头，并准备以芝麻买机枪一挺，以五石米买子弹。所有民兵开支，都从生产中解决了。
