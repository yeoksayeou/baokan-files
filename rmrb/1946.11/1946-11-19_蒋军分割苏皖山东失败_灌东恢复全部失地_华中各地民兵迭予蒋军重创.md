Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 15th: Chiang Kai-shek's and puppet troops in Xinpu and Haizhou, northern Jiangsu, attempted to coordinate with Chiang's troops invading Lianshui to divide the fifth and sixth districts of Jiangsu and Anhui and cut off the traffic between Jiangsu-Anhui and Shandong. This conspiracy has been declared bankrupt. Up to the 10th of this month, in half a month, the military and civilians of Guanyun East recovered all the lost territory occupied by the 57th Division (formerly the 98th Army) of Chiang's army, Duan Linmao's troops, and the puppet bandit Xu Jitai's troops in mid-to-late October. This includes more than 100 square kilometers south of Shanhou River, north of Chao River, east of Dachai City, and west of Yanbi Port in Guanyun, as well as the triangular area south of Pingming Street, north of Shangfang, and east of Wawuji for more than thirty miles. In eight battles of various sizes, a total of 518 Chiang and puppet troops were killed or wounded, 581 Chiang's army commanders and puppet brigade deputies were captured, two machine guns and 337 rifles were seized.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 14th: A comprehensive report on guerrilla warfare from various parts of Central China: The New Fourth Army's Hongze Lake naval unit, in a half-hour battle on the 3rd, defeated Chiang's army advancing north along the waterway from Gaoliangjian (more than 70 miles southwest of Huaiyin) to Chengzi Lake and Gaojiazhuang, killing more than 40 Chiang soldiers and seizing 10 steel-plated boats and more than 20 wooden boats. Furthermore, another unit of the New Fourth Army raided Jing'ertou, ten miles north of Suqian City, on the night of the 1st, capturing 47 Chiang soldiers below the company commander level, killing or wounding more than 50, and seizing eight rifles. The remnants fled to Suqian City. The Shunhe District of Huai'an, once occupied by Chiang's army, saw its militia relentlessly strike the invaders, successively eliminating seven Chiang-appointed Bao chiefs. Another Chiang-appointed Bao chief, upon hearing the news, voluntarily resigned, writing in his resignation letter: "I must buy a coffin before becoming a Bao chief, otherwise..." Chiang's army would set up telephone lines during the day, only to have them cut by the militia at night. One militiaman cut the telephone lines three times in one night, recovering more than 2,000 catties of wire. Eight militiamen from a certain village in the district were forced to carry stretchers for Chiang's army. When Chiang's army retreated, they deliberately lagged behind and carried nineteen boxes of bullets back to their own troops. The militia of the Northern Canal District of Suqian annihilated two Chiang-appointed township offices on the 1st, capturing 50 and killing more than 10, seizing more than 10 rifles. The miraculous detachment of the New Fourth Army in Guanyun encircled and annihilated more than 10 Chiang and puppet troops below the company commander level on the 2nd, seizing 18 long and short guns. A unit of the children soldiers in the Yancheng-Funing area went deep behind Chiang's lines for guerrilla warfare on the 30th of last month, captured seven Chiang soldiers artillerymen without firing a shot, and seized eight mules and horses, two horse-drawn carts, and returned fully loaded. A unit of the New Fourth Army within Guanyun drove out the Chiang and puppet troops occupying Maitun (forty miles west of Guancheng) on the 2nd. The Jiangdu militia repelled more than 600 Chiang soldiers who came out of Dinggou and Xiaoji Yuzhen to harass them on September 21, killing or wounding 50 of them.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 15th: Cadres who persist in the struggle behind Chiang's lines are steadfast and unyielding, and heroes emerge one after another. For example, Guo Yuebo, the township head of Cai'ou Township in Rugao, was taken away by Chiang's "Self-Defense Force" and forced to kneel. Guo resolutely resisted and angrily rebuked, "Only cowards kneel before traitors!" After the news of Guo's heroic sacrifice spread, Guo's father immediately sent his eldest son, Yuexuan, to join the army to avenge his youngest son, Yuebo. Guo Yuexuan has already put on the military uniform left by his younger brother and vowed "not to rest until justice is done!" Li Wenyuan, a teacher from Jingjiang, shouted loudly when he was murdered by Chiang's army: "We are fighting for the poor to turn over, and it is glorious to die! See how you traitors will end up!" Wang Lang, the village chief of a village in the Gushan District of Jingjiang, was a Communist Party member. When he was arrested and forced to surrender, he refused, saying: "Born as a Communist, die as a Communist ghost!" He endured all kinds of cruel tortures, but never yielded until death. Chen Wenfa, the village chief of Changpian Village in Zishi County, was unfortunately captured in the struggle against grain robbery. Chiang's army forced him to "confess," but Chen also sternly rejected him and died heroically.
