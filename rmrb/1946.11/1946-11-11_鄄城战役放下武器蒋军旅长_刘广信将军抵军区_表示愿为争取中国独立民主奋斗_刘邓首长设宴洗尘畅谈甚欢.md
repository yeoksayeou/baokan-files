Commander Liu told him that Chiang Kai-shek was using mercenaries to fight the Eighth Route Army, and the Northwest Army was forced to attack the Liberated Areas. We were forced to fight back, which was truly a last resort. He expressed a warm welcome to Brigade Commander Liu's wish to visit the Liberated Areas and hoped that he would offer more criticism.
