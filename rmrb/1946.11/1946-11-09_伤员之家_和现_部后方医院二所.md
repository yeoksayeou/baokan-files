　　Home for the Wounded
　　The Second Rear Hospital of the "He Xian" Unit
　　Just as Company Commander Li said upon returning to his unit, "The hospital is like my own home." The Second Rear Hospital of the "He Xian" Unit has truly become a home for the wounded soldiers.
　　In the village where the Second Hospital is stationed, from one end of the street to the other, you won't see piles of dirty soil, broken straw, or fallen leaves. Inside the hospital, you won't find a single piece of tattered cloth or cotton. When you step into the wards, all you see are wounded soldiers lying quietly on thick mattresses, covered with snow-white cotton quilts. There are no flies buzzing around, and you won't smell any foul odors that would make it hard to stay for long. The wounded soldiers get plenty of quiet rest.
　　The hospital's food is also very satisfactory to the wounded soldiers. Every morning, they have a bowl of hot soy milk. Each person gets seven qian of salt, five qian of oil, four liang of meat, half a jin of tofu, and two jin of vegetables per day. Seriously wounded soldiers even have their own individual cooking. The six cooks in Wang Biaode's squad cook for one hundred and seventy people, but they don't feel it's hard work. They say, "Even if there were another hundred, it wouldn't be a problem." This enthusiasm moves the wounded soldiers, who often write articles on the blackboard newspaper to praise them.
　　The club is equipped with Chinese chess and military chess sets, and hung with cartoons, slogans, and various newspapers and magazines. When there's nothing to do after meals, it's packed with groups of people leaning on crutches.
　　Mental peace and rich nutrition are two necessary conditions for the new wartime wound treatment. The Second Rear Hospital of the "He Xian" Unit has fully achieved these. The new wartime wound treatment has repeatedly created new records. The original goal for the suppuration rate was no more than ten percent, but the Second Hospital has lowered it to only 1.4%. The great effectiveness of the new treatment method is inseparable from the efforts of the medical staff. Because wounds that do not suppurate are not redressed. Whether or not a wound is suppurating is determined by whether the wound has a foul smell. For this reason, the nurses have to put their noses on the wounds every day to smell them, regardless of whether the wound is on the upper limb, lower limb, or the dirtiest place. Comrade Huang Zihe, a doctor, can tell you the current condition of a wounded soldier's wound and how to treat it, without untying the bandages, for all one hundred and sixty of the wounded soldiers he treats. From this, you can see his concern for the wounded soldiers and how detailed his understanding is. No wonder that when he was ill, a wounded soldier from a certain brigade said to Political Commissar Qin of the hospital, "I'd rather die than let Doctor Huang die." This spirit of caring for and loving the wounded soldiers among the medical staff deeply moved Xu Chengyun, a lieutenant colonel military doctor from the Newly Organized Third Division who had just joined our army. He also worked enthusiastically, making sure to visit the wards two or three times a day, always asking the wounded soldiers questions and showing them care. The wounded soldiers unanimously felt that he was already completely like the doctors in the People's Army, a beloved comrade of the wounded soldiers.
　　The nurses launched a challenge, each setting out competitive conditions to ensure that they do a good job of nursing. Wang Chunwu, a fourteen-year-old nurse, once sat for fifteen consecutive night shifts, making sure to bring hot water to the wounded soldiers four times every night. The happy wounded soldiers affectionately call him "Little Mouse". Seriously wounded soldiers have someone to wash their faces every day and wash their feet every ten days. Therefore, several wounded soldiers who had just joined the army said, "Even at home, our parents wouldn't take care of us this well."

### 伤员之家  “和现”部后方医院二所

　　伤员之家
    “和现”部后方医院二所
    正像李连长归队时所说：“医院就像自己的家。”“和现”部后方医院二所真成了伤员们的家了。
    在二所的驻村里，从街这头到街那头，你看不见堆着的污土、碎草和落叶。在病院里，你找不出一点破烂布和棉花。当你迈进了病房时，一眼所见的，只是伤员铺着很厚的褥子，盖着雪白的棉被子在那里静静的躺着。没有飞着的苍蝇，也闻不到难以令人久站的臭气，伤员们得到充分安静的休息。
    医院的伙食，也是使伤员们非常满意的。每天早上一碗滚热的豆浆，每人一天可以吃到七钱盐、五钱油、四两肉、半斤豆腐、二斤菜，重伤员们还有自己的小锅饭。在王表德班的六个炊事员，做着一百七十个人的饭，但他们并不觉苦，他们说：“再有一百个也不成问题。”这种热情感动得伤员们常在黑板报上写稿子来表扬他们。
    俱乐部里摆着象棋、军棋，挂着漫书、标语，还有各种报纸和杂志。饭后没有事的时候，这里便挤满了一群群拄着手杖的人。
    精神安静，营养丰富，这是新战伤疗法的两个必要条件，“和现”部后方医院已完全实现了。新战伤疗法一次次的创造了新的纪录，化脓率原来的号召是不超过百分之十，可是二所竟低到百分之一点四了。新治疗法收到如此大的宏效，是与医务人员的努力分不开的，因为凡是不化脓的伤口是不换药的，是否化脓是看伤口有没臭味，为此，护士们每日要把鼻子放在伤口上闻闻，不管伤口是在上肢、下肢或是最脏的地方。医生黄子和同志他能够对他所治疗的一百六十位伤员，不用解开绳带，就可以告诉他伤口现在怎样并如何处理，从这里就可以知道他对于伤员的关心和了解到如何细致的程度了。怪不得当他病的时候，某旅一个伤员向医院秦政委说：“宁教我死了，也不能叫黄医生死了。”医务人员中这种关心和爱护伤员的精神，把刚参加我军的整三师中校军医徐承云深深的感动了，他也就热情的工作着，每天必定要到病房两三次，每次总是亲切向伤员们问长问短，伤员们一致感觉到他和人民军队里的医生已经完全一样，是伤员的亲爱同志了。
    看护们发动了挑战，每个人都订出了竞赛条件，保证做好护理工作。十四岁的小看护王春五，曾接连坐了十五个夜班，每夜一定要给伤员们送四次热开水，高兴的伤员们亲切地喊他“小老鼠”。重伤员们每天都有人给洗脸，每十天洗脚一次。因此，使得几个刚参军不久的伤员都说：“我们在家时，爹娘招呼也不会这样好。”
