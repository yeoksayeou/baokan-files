　　The Revival of Extraterritoriality
    Liberation Daily Commentary
    According to a report in Tianjin's Ta Kung Pao: The Chiang Kai-shek government and the U.S. military authorities stationed in China have signed the "Sino-U.S. Joint Police-Military Protocol" in Beiping, implementing joint Sino-U.S. police-military operations. This is the revival of extraterritoriality for American imperialism in China and another crime of Chiang Kai-shek selling out national sovereignty. The abolition of extraterritoriality for foreign powers in China was one of the results of the Chinese people's eight years of bloody resistance. Chiang Kai-shek, in his various speeches, had shamelessly stolen it as his own "great achievement"; yet how long has it been before this recovered sovereignty is being sold off piecemeal by Chiang Kai-shek, and extraterritoriality is gradually being revived. However, this time the object of the sale is American imperialism alone, and only his American father has this special privilege. Look! A long time ago, the U.S. and Chiang established the "Regulations on Criminal Cases of U.S. Military Personnel," stipulating that "all criminal cases committed by U.S. military personnel shall be handed over to their own military courts or military authorities for separate trial." Earlier this month, the so-called "Sino-U.S. Business Arbitration Council" was established, and all disputes between Sino-U.S. merchants are handled by the council. It is generally rumored to be a "Public Judgment Committee" or "Arbitration Tribunal," which is actually a disguised consular jurisdiction. Now, with the joint Sino-U.S. police-military operations, all U.S. military personnel involved in incidents are handled by American police and military, and the Chinese police have no right to interfere. Isn't this encouraging the U.S. military in China to commit even more outrageous crimes of murder and rape!? In the past year, the atrocities of the U.S. military in China have emerged one after another, and the people's resentment has reached its peak, demanding the withdrawal of the U.S. military stationed in China; but the Chiang government not only does not seek to stop the atrocities of the U.S. military, but also provides legal protection. From now on, the U.S. military in China can be even more rampant.
    We strongly protest against the "Sino-U.S. Joint Police-Military Protocol" privately traded between American imperialism and the Chinese reactionaries! The great patriotic movement of the Chinese people will eventually prove that the independence and integrity of China's territorial sovereignty are sacred and inviolable!

　　治外法权的复活
    解放日报时评
    据天津大公报消息：蒋介石政府已与驻华美军当局在北平签订“中美警宪联勤议定书”，实行中美警宪联勤。这是美帝国主义在华治外法权的复活，是蒋介石又一出卖国家主权的罪行。列强在中国治外法权的废除，为中国人民八年血肉抗战成果之一。蒋介石在历次讲演中，曾厚颜无耻地窃为他本人的“伟大功绩”；然而曾几何时，这一已收回的主权又被蒋介石所零星发售，治外法权又逐渐复活。不过，这次出售的对象是美帝国主义一国，也只有他的美国爸爸单独占有此种特权而已。看吧！很早以前，美蒋之间就订立关于“美军事人员刑事案件条例”，规定“一切美军事人员如犯刑事案件的，应交由其本国军事法庭或军事当局单独裁判”。本月初又成立所谓“中美商人仲裁会”，凡中美商人间的纠纷，一概交由该会处理。一般传为“公断委员会”或“仲裁法庭”，实即变相领事裁判权。现在又有中美警宪联勤，索性把肇事美军概由美国警宪处理，中国警察局无权过问。这不是鼓励在华美军更放肆地杀人奸淫的犯罪行为吗！？一年来，美军在华暴行层出不穷，人民愤恨达于极顶，纷纷要求撤退驻华美军；但蒋政府对美军暴行不但不谋制止，而且更予合法保障。从此，美军在华更可横行无忌了。
    我们严重抗议美帝国主义与中国反动派所私相授受的“中美警宪联勤”，全中国人民绝不承认这种卖国条约！中国人民伟大的爱国运动，终将证明中国领土主权的独立完整是神圣不可侵犯的！
