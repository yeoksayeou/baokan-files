　　Deepen Land Reform
    Neiqiu Distributes Land Meticulously
    Good land is exchanged for poor land, near land is exchanged for far land; grain and materials are distributed according to grades to fill the gaps, and every family obtains the means of production.
    [This newspaper's dispatch] Comrade Ziqi of the Neiqiu Joint Office reports: As of mid-month, 120 administrative villages in the new district of Neiqiu have been swept up in the fierce land reform movement. Among them, 64 villages have initially achieved "land to the tiller." The other 56 villages are undergoing a deeper movement. Peasants have recovered more than 56,000 mu of land that had been plundered, and established strong peasant associations and militias. In the current recruitment, a high degree of patriotic enthusiasm has been shown. In the Chengguan District, more than 500 young adults voluntarily joined the army. The first and second districts both completed their expansion plans within one day. Through the movement, village cadres who had made mistakes corrected them and re-united closely with the masses, further consolidating the peasant ranks. Work in backward villages has made significant progress with the strong efforts of county and district cadres. The reactionary rule of the evil landlords is being quickly destroyed. When distributing the land obtained through struggle, the peasants follow the principle of distributing land according to the amount and quality of each household's existing land, first distributing to peasants with no land or too little land, and implementing "exchanging good land for poor land, exchanging poor land for good land, exchanging near land for far land, and exchanging far land for near land," so that everyone obtains four to six mu of land. Other grains and materials are distributed according to wealth and actual needs to fill the gaps. Every household obtains the means of production. Livestock is distributed to several or ten households to be raised together, in order to promote mutual aid and cooperation. Note: In the past year, the mass movement in this county has gone through three major stages: anti-traitor, rent reduction and liquidation, and the recent implementation of "land to the tiller," with three climaxes in January, May, and August. After the first two climaxes, progress stagnated due to complacency among cadres, resulting in a wave-like development. This movement was launched after a major inspection of the mass movement in September. The characteristics of the movement are universality, intensity, and thoroughness. Many advanced villages that were previously thought to be "problem-free" were found to have peasants who had not been liberated after inspection, with even 11 households in Xincheng Village in the top-performing First District. The cadres' complacency was thus overcome, and they went deep into the poorest and most honest masses, resulting in greater development of the movement than before. Based on this situation, the county party committee called for the complete realization of "land to the tiller" within the next month.

　　深入土地改革
    内邱细致分配土地
    有好地的分坏地，有远地的分近地；粮食物资分等填补，家家获得生产资本。
    【本报讯】内邱联合办公室子琦同志报导：截至本月中旬止，内邱新区一百二十个行政村均卷入猛烈的土地改革运动。其中六十四村已初步达到耕者有其田。另外五十六村正在深入运动。农民收回五万六千多亩被掠夺的土地，建立了坚强的农会与民兵。仅二区即发展了农会会员八百八十人，民兵六百五十人。此次参军中，更表现了高度的爱国热情，城关区自动参军的青壮年达五百多人。一、二区均在一天内就完成了扩军计划。经过运动，犯错误的村干部均改正了错误，重新与群众亲密的团结起来，使农民阵营益趋巩固。落后村工作在县区干部大力突击下，均得到显著进展。奸霸地主的反动统治，很快被摧毁着。农民在分配斗争回来的土地时，均依照各户现有土地的多少与优劣，先分给没地的与地太少的农民，并实行“有好地的分坏地，有坏地的分好地，有近地的分远地，有远地的分近地”，使人人获得土地四亩至六亩。其他粮食、物资等，依照富力大小与实际需要，实行分等填补。使户户获得生产资本。牲口则分给几户或十来户伙喂一头，以推动互助合作。按：该县群运一年来曾经过反奸、减租清算与最近实行“耕者有其田”的三个大阶段，有过一月、五月、八月三次高潮。前两次高潮后，均曾因干部发生自满而一度停滞，形成波浪式的发展。这次运动，是经过九月份的群运大检查后掀起的。运动特点是普遍、猛烈与彻底。许多过去认为“没问题了”的先进村，经过检查，都发现有未翻身的农民，连顶好的一区新城村也还有十一户。干部自满情绪因而顺利克服，都深入到最贫苦老实的群众中去，使运动较前得到很大发展。县委根据这一情况，号召在今后一月内完全实现耕者有其田。
