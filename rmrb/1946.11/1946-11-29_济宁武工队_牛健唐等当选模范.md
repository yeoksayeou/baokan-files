Ji'ning Armed Work Team
    Niu Jiantang and Others Elected as Models

[This newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 25th dispatch] The Ji'ning Armed Work Team fought in Ji'ning city for a month, striking the enemy and protecting the interests of the people, and also strengthened itself, with many heroic models emerging. At this summing-up meeting, four outstanding models were democratically elected. First-class model comrade Niu Jiantang is a worker cadre of the Fifth District United Association. He served as a squad leader in the armed work team and always walked at the forefront in battles. He had severe sores all over his body, but he never asked for leave. Once, during a march, the sick and wounded took a boat, but he not only didn't sit but also personally pulled the boat... His unity and friendship were particularly good. Second-class model comrade Tang Zhenli is the steel gun captain. When the traitor Wu Huawen first attacked Ji'ning, he led the steel gun team to repel the enemy. Afterwards, he was elected as a militia hero by the Third District. Every time the armed work team entered Ji'ning city, he always took charge of guarding important intersections. He said, "Without orders, I will absolutely not move." During the fifth entry into the city, he was tasked with attacking the Xiaonan Gate in the machine gun squad. After occupying the gate, he monitored the enemy's movements. At this time, a few comrades became lax and planned to carry foreign flour. He patiently dissuaded them, saying, "Monitoring the enemy is important; now is not the time to carry things." A KMT secret agent from the Third District was a relative of his and sent someone to lobby him, asking him to defect with his gun. He immediately reported it to his superiors. He said at the meeting, "I, Tang Zhenli, have been working since I was twelve years old, and I have suffered countless hardships until I was twenty-three years old. The Communist Party led me to turn over a new leaf. I am not afraid of any hardship, and I will do it to the end. Even if my relatives are secret agents, even the closest people who are secret agents are my enemies." The third model comrade, Liu Guixian, and the fourth model comrade, Shen Jianming, were both very heroic and courageous in battle, able to overcome all difficulties and complete the tasks assigned by their superiors, earning everyone's praise.

　　济宁武工队
    牛健唐等当选模范
    【本报冀鲁豫二十五日电】济宁武工队在济宁市斗了一个月，打击了敌人，保护了人民利益，也锻炼了自己，出现了不少的英雄模范。这次总结会上，民主评选出四位特出的模范。一等模范牛健唐同志，是五区联合会的工人干部，他在武工队里当班长，他在战斗中总是走在最前头。身上长着疮很厉害，但从没有请过假，有一次行军中病号坐船，他不仅不坐，还亲自拉船……，团结友爱特别好。二等模范唐振力同志是钢枪队长，当汉奸吴化文第一次进攻济宁时，他领着钢枪队打退了敌人，事后被三区选为民兵英雄；武工队每次进济宁城关时，他总是担任重要街口的警戒。他说：“没有命令，我绝对不动。”第五次入关时，他在机枪班担任攻小南门的任务，占领该门后，监视敌人的行动。这时少数同志松懈起来，打算去扛洋面，他耐心的劝阻说：“监视敌人要紧，现在还不是背面的时候。”三区有一蒋特是他的亲戚，派人来活动，叫他连人带枪拉过去，他立刻报告了上级。他在会上讲：“我唐振力从十二岁就扛活，长到二十三岁，受的苦数不清。共产党领导我翻了身。我是不怕任何艰苦的，我要干到底。别说是我的亲戚当特务，就是再亲的人当特务，也是我的敌人。”第三名模范刘桂显同志、第四名模范沈建明同志在战斗中都是很英勇果敢，能克服一切困难完成上级交给的任务，博得大家称赞。
