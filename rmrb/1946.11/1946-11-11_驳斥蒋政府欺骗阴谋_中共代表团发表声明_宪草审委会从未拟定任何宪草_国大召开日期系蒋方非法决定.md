Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 5th (Delayed): According to Nanjing newspapers, Hong Lanyou, Secretary-General of the National Assembly Preparatory Committee, stated: The National Assembly will convene on November 12th to complete the constitution-making work, using the draft constitution deliberated by the Political Consultative Conference's Constitutional Draft Review Committee as a blueprint. In response, a spokesperson for the CCP delegation issued the following statement upon instruction:
    (1) The convening of the National Assembly on the 12th of this month is a unilateral act by the Kuomintang that violates the resolutions and procedures of the Political Consultative Conference. The CCP protested to the Kuomintang government authorities as early as July and declared that it would not be bound by it in any way. The resolutions and procedures of the Political Consultative Conference are a temporary charter unanimously adopted by all parties and social figures. All actions that violate this temporary charter, including the date of the National Assembly on November 12th, are illegal actions. The CCP opposes and refuses to participate in all of them.
    (2) The Political Consultative Conference's Constitutional Draft Review Committee has been at a standstill since returning to Nanjing in May and has not drafted any constitutional draft amendments. Only in mid-April did it appoint a constitutional draft group to raise questions and opinions on the revision of the constitutional draft. Although the group held multiple meetings and put forward some opinions on the constitutional provisions, the government representatives consistently opposed and attempted to undermine the principle of the Executive Yuan being responsible to the Legislative Yuan, as agreed upon by the Political Consultative Conference. The division of powers between the central and local governments, as well as the local system and status, were also subject to serious disputes. [Missing four characters] Chapter's supplementary rules were not discussed at all. The electoral system also only raised questions. The people's freedoms and rights, the National Assembly, and other chapters also had fundamental disputes, and the minutes of the group meetings were never sent to all parties for correction. At the last meeting of the group, Comrade Li Weihan, representing the CCP delegation, stated that the CCP side adopted a reserved attitude towards all group work and its records, which was agreed upon by Mr. Sun, the chairman of the group meeting, and included in the record. Therefore, the so-called using the draft constitution drafted by the Political Consultative Conference Review Committee as a blueprint is legally and factually unfounded.

    驳斥蒋政府欺骗阴谋
    中共代表团发表声明
    宪草审委会从未拟定任何宪草
    国大召开日期系蒋方非法决定
    【新华社南京五日电】（迟到）南京人报载，国民大会筹备委员会秘书长洪兰友氏谈话称：十一月十二日召开国民大会，为完成制宪工作以政协宪草审议会拟定之宪草为蓝本。对此，中共代表团发言人奉命声明：
    （一）本月十二日召开国大，原为国民党违反政协决议及其程序的一党片面行为，中共早在七月份即向国民党政府当局抗议，并声明不受其任何约束，政协决议及其程序，乃各党派及社会贤达一致通过之临时宪章，一切违反此临时宪章的行为，包含十一月十二日国大日期在内，皆为非法行为，中共一概反对，一概拒绝参加。
    （二）政协宪草审委会自五月还都以来即已停顿，更未拟定任何宪草修正案，仅在四月中旬，一度指定宪草小组对宪草修改提出问题及意见，该小组虽开会多次并对宪草条文提出若干意见，但政协关于行政院对立法院负责之原则，始终被政府代表反对并企图加以动摇。中央地方均权之划分，地方制度与地位，同样有严重争议。（缺四字）本章附则根本未议。选举制度亦仅提出问题，人民自由权利，国民大会及其他各章、亦均有原则性争议，而小组会议之纪录，又根本未送各方校正。在该小组末次会议上，由李维汉同志代表中共代表团声明中共方面小组工作及其纪录，全部采取保留的态度，并经小组会议主席孙先生同意列入纪录。因此所谓以政协审委会拟定之宪草为蓝本，无论在法律上及事实上都是没有根据的。
