Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 6th: Shanghai dispatch: With prices soaring daily, and the municipal authorities' published cost of living index for workers far lower than actual prices, labor strikes are sweeping the city. Over five hundred construction workers recently requested a wage increase from the Construction Industry Association through their trade union. They initially demanded an increase from the original 6,000 yuan per day to 15,000 yuan, then compromised to 10,000 yuan, but the employers still refused to agree. On October 22nd, over two hundred worker representatives from the industry petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau. Workers in the laundry, dyeing, and leather industries have also been on strike since October 22nd, demanding adjustments to their compensation. Recently, employers have been using excuses to dismiss worker leaders and union officials who are demanding improved conditions, an event which is constantly occurring. The resulting labor strikes are also increasing daily. In mid-October, the Da Gong Textile Company dismissed thirty-one worker leaders from the company's union under false pretenses, triggering protests from all five hundred workers, who unanimously demanded the reinstatement of the workers. The company not only refused to reply, but also dispatched a large contingent of military police to the company to suppress the workers, arousing extreme resentment among all workers. Consequently, on October 18th, they all went to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition. Seven hundred porcelain workers went on strike on October 18th, to protest the employer's unjustified dismissal of Zhuang Suqing, the person preparing the establishment of the union, and union leaders Hong Heyu and Tao Hanbin. They also went to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition. Workers at the American-owned China Electric Company went on strike on October 16th because the employer dismissed four representatives preparing to form a union.

　　上海普遍发生工潮
    要求增资，反对开除工会领袖。
    【新华社延安六日电】沪讯：物价日高，市府当局所发表之工人生活指数，远较物价为低、工潮遍市，土木业工人五百余名，近经职工会向营造工业同业公会再度要求加薪，提出将原工资每日六千元加至一万五千元后，让步为一万元，资方仍不答应。上月二十二日，该业职工代表二百余人，乃向社会局请愿。洗染制革等业，职工亦因要求调整待遇，自上月二十二日起，先后罢工。最近资方借故开除领导工人，要求改善待遇之工会负责人事件，不断发生。由此而引起的工潮，亦日渐增加。大公纺织公司于上月中旬，借故开除该公司工会中工人领袖三十一人，引起全体五百余名工人之抗议，一致要求收回成命，资方不但拒不答复，并派大队军警驻公司镇压，引起全体工人极度愤恨，遂于上月十八日，齐至社会局请愿。搓瓷业工人七百余人，为抗议资方无故开除工会筹备人庄苏清，及工会负责人洪鹤喻、陶汉滨等三人，于上月十八日全体罢工，并往社会局请愿。美商中国电气公司工人，于上月十六日全体罢工，亦由于资方开除筹组工会之四代表所致。
