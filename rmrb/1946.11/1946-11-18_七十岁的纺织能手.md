　　Zhisong's mother is from Xia Village, Licheng. She is already over seventy years old this year. Her hair is white, and her face is full of wrinkles. She is almost the oldest person in the village. In the past, she was an opium addict and smoked away her family fortune, so poor that she couldn't afford to eat. When the Eighth Route Army came, the world changed, she quit her addiction, and she had food to eat.

　　In 1943, when the government called for spinning and weaving, her old mind thought like this: "Spinning and weaving is naturally something for those 'good for nothings' to do, how can we learn that?" Thanks to the government's patient mobilization, and the "introduction" and leadership of the spinning hero Li Xiulian, by 1944, several active young women in the village had learned spinning and weaving, benefited from it, and even wore brand new clothes. Who wouldn't envy them!? At this time, Zhisong's mother's daughter-in-law wanted to join the spinning group, and she was allowed by her old lady. At this time, the old lady's mind changed to this: spinning and weaving is good! It's only for young people to learn, we're old and about to be buried! With clumsy hands and feet, you can't learn even if you want to. Not long after, her daughter-in-law also learned spinning and weaving. Her daughter-in-law persuaded her, "One hand can't clap, if I only spin, I'll miss the weaving, you also learn to spin! If you spin the thread for me, I can weave more cloth." At this time, she slowly began to learn to spin. Both mother-in-law and daughter-in-law learned it, but they didn't have money to buy cotton. The cooperative lent them cotton first. She spun faster and faster, and better and better. In more than twenty days, she spun nine and a half catties, earning more than two thousand yuan. The old lady was so happy that her mouth couldn't close. She raised two fingers and said to everyone, "Haha! Two thousand yuan in twenty days, my old woman can also make a lot of money."

　　On October 14th, the whole village held a spinning and weaving exhibition. Among the various exhibits, there was a bundle of snow-white fine thread, labeled "Spun by Zhisong's Mother". Everyone came to look at this bundle of thread: "Such an old woman can also learn to spin thread." Several young women also praised, "Even we young people can hardly spin so well." Finally, everyone elected Zhisong's mother as a spinning expert. A smile appeared on her wrinkled face, and she said, "Although I am old, I feel younger and younger, and I feel more and more energetic."

　　Under the influence of Zhisong's mother, not only all the daughters-in-law and young women in the village learned spinning and weaving, but even very old women flocked into the spinning and weaving craze. Now she has taught four elderly women. People all say: spin and weave well! Compete with Zhisong's mother.

    七十岁的纺织能手
    黎城一高学生仁端、爱生、森荣采访
    郭直夫执笔
    枝松的妈妈，是黎城霞庄村人，今年已经七十多岁了。头发苍白了，满脸是皱纹，全村差不多数她年纪大。过去她是个吸大烟的人，把家业吸完了，穷的吃不上饭。八路军来了，世道变了，她戒了瘾，也有了饭吃。
    一九四三年政府号召纺织，她的老脑筋是这样的想法：“纺织天生是那些‘草灰’干的事，咱们还能学那？”由于政府的耐心动员，和纺织英雄李秀莲的“引线”带头，到四四年，村里已经有几个积极的青年妇女学会了纺织，得了利，并且还穿上崭新的衣裳，大家谁不羡慕呢！？这时枝松妈妈的儿媳想加入纺织组，得到她老人家的允许了。这时老人家的脑子变成了这样：纺织倒好吧！只能年青人学，咱老了快入土啦！拙手笨脚的想学也学不会。过了不久，她的儿媳也学会了纺织。媳妇劝她说：“光我一手拍不响，只顾纺就误了织，你也学纺吧！你给咱纺线，我就能多多织布了”这时，她才慢慢学起纺来。婆媳都学会了，但没钱买花。合作社就先借给她花。她越纺越快，越纺越好，二十多天就纺了九斤半，赚了两千多元。她老人家喜的嘴都合不住，逢人就举起两个指头：“哈哈！二十天两千多元，我老婆也能赚大钱啦。”
    十月十四日，全村举行纺织展览会，在各色各样的展览品中，有一束雪白的细线，上面标写着“枝松的妈妈纺”。大家都来瞧这把线：“这么大年纪的老婆婆，原来也能学会纺线。”几个青年妇女也称赞说：“就我们青年人也难纺成这样好。”最后大家公选枝松妈妈当了纺线能手。在她满是皱纹的脸上，浮出了微笑，她说：“我虽然老了，却越活越觉得年青，越活越觉得有精神。”
    在枝松妈妈影响下，不仅全村的媳妇闺女们都学会了纺织，连很大年纪的老婆婆们，也涌入了纺织的热潮。现在她已经教会了四个上年纪的老婆婆了。人们都这样说：好好纺织吧！和枝松的妈妈竞赛。
