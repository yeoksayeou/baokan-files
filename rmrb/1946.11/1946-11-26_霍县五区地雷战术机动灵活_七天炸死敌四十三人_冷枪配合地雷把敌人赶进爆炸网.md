　　Huo County's Fifth District's Landmine Warfare Features Tactical Flexibility
    Seven Days See 43 Enemy Soldiers Killed
    Sniper Fire Combined with Landmines Drives the Enemy into a Network of Explosions
    [This newspaper, Yangcheng News] Since the Chiang Kai-shek troops invaded and occupied Huo County on October 10th, the militia and guerrillas of Huo County have universally launched landmine and sniper warfare to protect their homes and defend themselves, with the creations and achievements of the Fifth District being the greatest. When the enemy attacked Huo County, the district headquarters divided the entire district into two war zones, north and south. Each war zone organized militia rotation teams, combined with the militia of each village, to carry out guerrilla warfare of laying mines, ambushing, and sabotaging, and approached enemy strongholds, universally laying mines and setting up ambushes, so that the enemy was trapped in the strongholds and dared not go out easily. The enemy's transportation between Huo County and Zhao City also mostly detoured west of the Fen River.

    In the week from the 16th to the 22nd of last month, in the Fifth District alone, 23 landmines exploded, killing, wounding, and capturing 13 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers, and creating various new tactics. On the 16th, a small enemy unit reconnoitered roads near Xinzhai, initially triggering a mine, wounding two enemy soldiers, capturing a platoon leader, and taking two enemy soldiers prisoner, seizing one rifle and a bag of bullets. On the 17th, the militia of the North War Zone of our Fifth District set up an ambush next to the railway, capturing three enemies, obtaining three rifles, and more than two hundred bullets. After hearing this, the county rotation team militia, in order to launch a competition, immediately laid mines at the gate of the enemy blockhouse in Zhangjiabao and on the road that night. When the enemy still hadn't come out by dawn, they took the initiative to go to the front of the fort and fired a few shots. The enemy then sent a unit to pursue, but before they had gone two hundred meters, two enemies were injured by landmines, and the rest dared not pursue further, and hurriedly fled back. On the 18th, the militia of the South District of the Fifth District, in coordination with the district detachment, systematically laid out a minefield on the Hongya of Xinzhai Station, three miles to the south. The district secretary of the district and another district cadre directly participated in pulling the mines and providing cover. A 35-jin pull mine was buried on the highway, with the rope pulled into the ditch on the east side of the road. A 60-step long minefield was laid to the west of the road, with a total of thirteen linked mines. Until 10:00 a.m. on the 15th, when a unit of the enemy from Zhao City passed by and entered the minefield, the rope broke. The covering team on the east hill then dynamically fired randomly at the enemy. The enemy's tail team was immediately pinned down in the minefield on the west side of the road. After a burst of gunfire, all thirteen linked mines exploded, killing and wounding a total of sixteen enemies. Under the cover of mortars and heavy machine guns, the enemies retreated in a panic and were very embarrassed, even leaving four corpses in the river.

    In addition, the sharpshooter team of Zaojiayuan, under the leadership of Comrade ××, set up an ambush next to the Xinzhai Bridge on the 18th. Because the bridge was damaged, only a small path was left for people to walk. When an enemy unit was walking to the bridgehead, crowding and preparing to cross the bridge, suddenly, cold shots were fired randomly, scaring the enemy to hide in the tall grass west of the bridge, not daring to come out. As a result, they carried four stretchers back to the original place. (Nai Xiu, Chu Liang, Zhuang Qiang, Xu Feng).
    [Also Reported] The Taiyue Military Region Headquarters and the Armed Forces Committee recently issued a circular praising the militia of Changyang Huo County, and called on the militia of the entire region to learn from them. It stated:
    After the Chiang Kai-shek puppets invaded and occupied Huo County, the militia of the Fifth District of Huo County rose up to protect their homes and defend themselves, launching guerrilla warfare, using tactics such as ambushes, explosions, encirclements, and sabotages to inflict heavy blows on the invading army. In seven days, they killed or wounded forty-three enemies, with no casualties on our side. Among them, in one explosion in Xinzhai, thirteen linked mines exploded simultaneously, killing sixteen enemies. The technology was refined, the tactics were flexible, creating an example of combining explosions and sniper fire in the entire region. The achievement of this kind of achievement is mainly due to the mobility and tenacity of the militia in the district, and the active responsibility of the district and village cadres, who personally participated and were good at organizing guerrilla warfare. Under the influence of this district, all districts in Huo County have launched an explosion competition. All militia in the region should learn from them, combine sniper fire to launch an explosion competition, and give the invading enemies a fatal blow.

　　霍县五区地雷战术机动灵活
    七天炸死敌四十三人
    冷枪配合地雷把敌人赶进爆炸网
    【本报阳城讯】自十月十日蒋军侵占我霍县城后，霍县民兵游击队为保家自卫，普遍展开地雷战和冷枪战，其中尤以五区的创造和成绩为最大。当敌人进攻霍县时，区指挥部就把全区分为南北两个战区，每个战区都组织了民兵轮战队，结合各村民兵展开了埋雷、伏击、破击的游击战，并逼近敌人据点，普遍埋雷设伏，使敌人困守据点，轻易不敢外出，霍县、赵城间敌之交通亦多绕道汾河以西。
    上月十六日到二十二日一周内，仅五区地雷爆炸二十三个，毙伤俘蒋军十三人，并创造出各种新的战术。十六日有敌少数部队，向辛置附近侦察道路，开始碰到了一个雷的爆炸，炸伤敌二名，活捉排长一名，俘敌二名，得步枪一支、子弹一袋。十七日我五区北战区民兵设伏在铁路旁，抓获敌人三名，得步枪三支，子弹二百余发。县轮战队民兵听到后，为了展开竞赛，当晚即在张家堡敌炮楼门口、路上埋雷。待至天明敌人还未出来，他们便主动的到堡子跟前，打了几枪，敌人随派兵一部出来追击，没走出二百公尺，两个敌人即被地雷炸伤、其余不敢再追，急忙窜回。十八日五区南区民兵配合区分队有计划的在辛置车站南三里之红崖上摆开了地雷阵，该区区书及另一区干部，直接参加拉雷打掩护，汽路上埋了一颗三十五斤的拉雷，绳子拉在东面的山沟里，路西布了六十步长的雷阵、共下了十三个连环雷。直到十五日上午十时，赵城一部敌人路过，进入雷区时，拉绳断了，东山上的掩护队，便机动的向敌人乱枪射击，敌尾队即被压在路西雷区里，一阵枪声，十三个连环雷都爆炸了，共炸死伤敌十六名。敌人在迫击炮、重机枪的掩护下仓慌溃退，十分狼狈，还把四具尸首丢在河里。
    另有枣家园的神枪组，于十八号在××同志的带领下，设伏辛置桥旁。因桥被破坏，仅留一人行小道，当蒋军一部行至桥头，拥挤着准备过桥时，猛不防，冷枪乱射，吓的敌人钻在桥西蒿草内不敢出来，结果抬了四付担架返回原地。（乃修、初亮、壮强、徐丰）。
    【又讯】太岳军区司令部及武委总会顷通令长扬霍县民兵。并号召全区民兵学习，内称：
    蒋伪侵占霍县后，霍县五区民兵群起保家自卫，开展游击战争，以埋伏、爆炸、围困、破击等战术，给进犯军以重大打击。七日杀伤敌人四十三名，我无一人伤亡，其中辛置一次爆炸，连环雷齐发十三响、炸死敌十六名。技术精练，战术灵活，创造全区爆炸冷枪结合的范例。此种成绩之获得，主要由于该区民兵之机动顽强，与区村干部之积极负责，亲自参加，善于组织游击战争。在该区影响下，霍县各区已展开爆炸竞赛。全区民兵均应向他们学习，结合冷枪展开爆炸竞赛，给进犯敌人以致命打击。
