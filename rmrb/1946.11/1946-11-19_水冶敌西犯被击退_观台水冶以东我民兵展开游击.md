    Enemy Attack Westward from Shuizhi Repulsed
    People's Militia Launch Guerrilla Warfare East of Guantai and Shuizhi
    [This Dispatch from Changzhi, 18th] Since the Chiang Kai-shek troops in Anyang, northern Henan, occupied Shuizhi, they have launched westward attacks along the Shuilin (County) highway for several days, but all have been repulsed. On the 11th, over 1,000 of these enemy troops launched a westward attack via Sanjia Village, but were repulsed. On the 12th, they again split into three routes, passing through villages such as Hexi and Jiulu Mountain, and infiltrated the Lijiadian and Wangjiayao areas along the Shuilin highway. They were met with a strong resistance from us. Unable to withstand the attack, the enemy retreated completely back to Shuizhi that evening. The puppet Sun Dianying's troops, numbering over 400, who had invaded our Shanying Town (south of Shuizhi) from Tangyin and Hebi, launched a westward attack on the border of An(yang) and Lin(xian) counties on the 15th in two routes, infiltrating villages such as Beiqi, Nanyan, and Majia (all under Anyang jurisdiction). They were routed by us, and one of their platoons was annihilated. The puppets abandoned 11 corpses and fled back to Shanying in a panic. In this battle, it is estimated that over 50 puppets were killed or wounded, and four were captured. Our troops suffered no casualties. Furthermore, the people's militia fought extremely bravely in this Anyang campaign. Each time, people's militia participated in the battle. Although the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops have invaded our Shuizhi and Guantai, the county's militia are still widely launching guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines in the areas east of the two locations. On the 3rd of this month, the people's militia in villages such as Shicun, Shuiyu, and Daye, northeast of Shuizhi, jointly defeated over 30 Chiang Kai-shek troops, captured Chiang Kai-shek secret agents Cao Erjin and Wang Jinlin, and seized one pistol.
