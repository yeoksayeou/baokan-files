　　Taihang Conducts Self-Defense Donations
    Prefecture-Level Donations Exceed 200,000 Yuan
    Jinnan Bank Factory No. 1 Employees Voluntarily Work Extra to Support the Front Lines
    [Report from this newspaper in Changzhi] The Taihang region has launched a self-defense donation campaign to support the front lines, and has already achieved great results. This movement has spread from the administrative office level to all party, government, military, civilian organizations, and to all urban and rural people of all classes in the entire region, who are actively conducting savings and donations. As of the tenth of this month, the military region has received donations from the administrative office level and various organs and groups amounting to 248,980 yuan, 1,279 catties of rice, 263 square feet of white cloth, and numerous shoes, socks, clothing, soap, and toothpaste. Many letters of condolence to the self-defense soldiers at the front were attached, encouraging them to bravely strike at the invading army, and reporting that rear area work has been strengthened! If the front lines need it, they will immediately take up arms and rush to the front lines to fight for peace and democracy.
    The Gaoyi County government is practicing thrift to support the front lines. In October, savings of millet reached 1,500 catties, and all cadres in the Fourth District also saved 1,000 catties of millet and 10,400 yuan of vegetable money this month. The grain allocation organs deducted and handed over the amount as a donation. County Chief Tian borrowed and donated his fields and donated the cotton clothes he was supposed to receive this winter, and personally took apart and washed old cotton clothes to get through the winter.
    Cadres of the Huguan County government responded to the call of the "New Masses" bi-monthly magazine to donate books and newspapers to comfort the troops, donating a total of 5,770 yuan for books and newspapers. Personnel from the county-run stores Huaxing and Zhixing also actively responded. Huaxing donated more than 3,900 yuan, and Zhixing donated more than 1,800 yuan, all of which have been sent to the front lines free of charge through the county post office.

    [Report from this newspaper] The workers of Factory No. 1 of Jinnan Bank, hearing that Chiang Kai-shek had invaded Zhangjiakou, Jiaozuo, and other places, were indignant and proposed: "Turn our workshop into a patriotic battlefield!" "I want to work actively and catch up with the labor heroes!"... They immediately decided to increase their voluntary work by one hour per day, and their work efficiency also exceeded usual. Currently, all the workers in the factory have donated 97,340 yuan in local currency and towels, undershirts, etc., which they have saved up, and entrusted this newspaper to forward them to the soldiers at the front. In their letter of condolence to the front lines, they said: "We are producing in the rear, and we will support you with the work efficiency of one person doing the work of two."
