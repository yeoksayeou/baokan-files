　　Border Region Assembly Cables Congratulations on Victory in Junan
    [This newspaper's report] The Border Region Assembly, overjoyed by the victory in Junan, sent a telegram to Commander Liu, Political Commissar Deng, and all officers and soldiers, offering congratulations. The original telegram is as follows:
    To Commander Liu, Political Commissar Deng, and all officers and soldiers:

    We are delighted to learn that on October 30th, our Border Region's own sons and daughters, the Eighth Route Army, annihilated one and a half brigades of Chiang's troops between Heze and Juancheng, seizing many heavy artillery pieces, machine guns, automobiles, and tanks, delivering yet another powerful blow to the invaders. This proves excellent command and the dedication of the soldiers. The good news has filled us with immense joy. This assembly, on behalf of the 30 million people of the Border Region, extends our heartfelt congratulations and regards, and wishes you good health!

                                  Respectfully, the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Assembly
