　　Rapid and Timely War Support Work in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region
    Chairman Yang of the Border Government Issues Commendation
    [Our Newspaper’s Dispatch] The Jin-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Government, Vice Chairman Yang Rong, issued a commendation order on the 12th of this month to the war support personnel on the front lines of Hebei-Shandong-Henan. The order stated: The four great victories achieved by the Hebei-Shandong-Henan front in annihilating seven and a half enemy brigades and eleven security regiments, totaling more than 55,000 people, are inseparable from the timely organization and mobilization of the people and all levels of Party, government, and civilian cadres in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan rear area to supply the front lines, and the emergence of a large number of war support models and heroes. According to observations by this government, many responsible cadres personally organized the masses, led stretcher teams, braved enemy artillery fire and continuous autumn rains, and traveled day and night, sometimes crossing waist-deep ponds and rivers, to rescue the wounded on the front lines. There have also been considerable contributions to work in areas such as supply stations, transportation and supply, and rear hospitals. This spirit of serving the war and the people to a high degree is worthy of study by all cadres and the broad masses of people in the region. After praising and commending, the order emphatically pointed out that this spirit should be continuously enhanced and continued to be promoted in the future, with particular attention paid to the timeliness and speed of supply, and attention to calculation to ensure supply while reducing the loss and waste of materials and manpower, and to take extra care of the wounded, in order to win the victory in the patriotic self-defense war.
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Hebei-Shandong-Henan] During the recent Juhe Highway campaign, the war support tasks were very heavy, but the stretcher teams in various districts of Yunbei overcame all difficulties and completed their tasks as scheduled. The Fifth District provided a total of 230 stretchers, the Ninth District 250, and the Third District 250. Several times they set off on the same day they received their tasks. Each district also sent more than a catty of rice and noodles to the front every day. The cadres traveled back and forth, not shirking hardship. They all unanimously stated: As long as it can be done and provided, they will not be afraid of hardship and difficulty to complete the task. In particular, none of the first 50 stretchers from the Third District deserted, and the General Supply Station awarded them 100,000 yuan. The Fourth District had a relatively small population, so when they had exhausted the stretchers of the self-defense force, they used elderly and young people to lead animals to carry rice and noodles. This spirit of overcoming difficulties to support the front lines is worthy of commendation, and we must carry it forward in the future. The militia battalion of the Yunju County, which participated in the war, also completed its tasks very well in this campaign. They were responsible for guarding the command post and communications work. The 44 of them were divided into sending letters, standing guard, transferring prisoners, and escorting stretcher transport. The work was very heavy, averaging more than 20 trips a day, with each person walking 70 li. No one rested for a whole day. Sometimes, after returning from delivering a letter, they would immediately stand guard, and the lights were never turned off at night. But they did not feel how hard it was, did not utter a word of complaint, and persisted to the end. Many models and heroes also emerged. Huang Huaishan, who is already 45 years old, once fell into the water while delivering a letter to a certain unit when passing over a bridge. The water was very deep, with only his head exposed, but he held his hand up, fearing that the letter would get wet. After swallowing several mouthfuls of water, he struggled to get up and finally delivered the letter and completed his mission. Because of his age, he was sick for two days after returning. The superiors asked him to rest, but seeing that there were many letters and few people, he said, "I can still walk, the illness doesn't matter." He did not go on sick leave and continued to make trips. Li Yongguang is a good comrade who endures hardship before others and works without fatigue. His feet were blistered, and he walked crookedly on his heels, but he worked the same as others. When others were unwilling to deliver letters, he would take them over, no matter how tired he was. If there were several letters to be delivered at the same time, he would rush to say, "I'll go to the far ones, let them go to the near ones." He usually volunteered for odd jobs such as fetching firewood and noodles. His spirit moved many people, making the people around him actively influenced by him. Thanks to the efforts of all the comrades in the first company, they persisted for a month and successfully completed their tasks.

　　冀鲁豫战勤工作迅速及时
    边府杨主席通令嘉奖
    【本报讯】晋冀鲁豫边区政府杨戎正副主席于本月十二日通令嘉奖冀鲁豫前线战勤工作人员。该通令称：冀鲁豫前线获得歼灭敌人七个半旅，十一个保安团，共五万五千余人的四次伟大胜利，实与冀鲁豫后方人民及党政民全体干部之及时组织动员供应前线，涌现出大批战勤模范、英雄之事实分不开。据本府视察所及很多负责干部亲自组织群众，带领担架，冒着敌人的炮火与连绵的秋雨，日夜奔波，有时且渡过深及腰际的水塘与河流，到火线抢救伤员；其他对兵站、运输供应、后方医院等工作亦有不少供献。此种高度为战争为人民服务的精神，深值全区政民干部和广大人民学习。通令于嘉奖表扬后，着重指出，今后应不断提高并继续发扬此种精神，特别注意供应之及时迅速，并注意计算，保证供给而又减少物资、民力之损失与浪费，并加意爱护伤员，以争取爱国自卫战争之胜利。
    【本报冀鲁豫讯】此次巨荷公路战役中，战勤任务非常繁重，但郓北各区的担架队克服了一切困难，如期完成了任务。五区共出担架二百三十付，九区二百五十付，三区二百五十付，几次都是接到任务当日出发的。每区每日并送前方米面窝余斤，干部来回的跋涉不辞劳苦，都一致表示：只要能办得到，出得来，决不怕艰苦困难完成任务。尤其是三区第一次五十付担架没一个逃亡的，总兵站特奖洋十万元。四区人数比较少，出担架自卫队出光了，就用老年少年牵牲口驮米面，这种克服困难支援前线的精神，是值得表扬，我们今后要发扬下去的。郓巨县参战的民兵营第一连，在这次战役中，也很好的完成了他们的任务。他们，担任着指挥部警卫与通讯工作，他们共四十四个人，分担送信、站岗、转送俘虏、护送担架运输等工作。工作任务是非常繁重的，每日平均出差二十多次，每人要走七十里路，一个人没有休息过一整天，有时送信回来接着站岗，晚上没熄过灯，可是他们并不觉得怎样苦，没发一句怨言，坚持到底，还出现了不少模范和英雄。黄怀山，已经四十五岁了，有一次他到×部去送信，经过一个桥，一不小心就掉在水里。水很深，只露着头，可是他把手举起来，怕信湿了，喝了几口水他挣扎着上来了，他终于把信送到完成了任务。因为他年纪大，回来就病了两天。上级让他休息，可是他看着信多人少，他说：“我还能走，病不要紧。”他不挂病号，仍然出差。李永光是一个吃苦在前，工作起来不知疲劳的好同志，他脚上磨了泡，一歪一歪的用脚后跟走，干起来和别人一样，别人不高兴送信时，他接过来就去，不管自己多么累；如果有几封信同时送时，他抢着说：“那个远我去，近的叫他们去。”平常领柴、面等零碎活，他都争着办，他这种精神，感动了不少的人，使得他周围的人，都受了他的影响积极起来了。一连由于全体同志的努力，他们坚持了一个月，圆满完成了任务。
