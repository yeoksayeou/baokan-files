Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 14th: Reports from various sources indicate that the results of the French elections are still being tallied. According to the Associated Press, due to the election results, the Popular Republican Movement has lost its leading position, and the Bidault government decided on the 13th to resign when the new National Assembly convenes on November 28th. This decision may specifically cause the Bidault government to withdraw its qualification to attend the New York Four-Power Conference. Currently, Bidault is represented at the New York Four-Power Conference by Undersecretary Merville. The Communist Party taking power will enable them to send their own representatives to the Four-Power Conference and the Security Council, which will enhance the Soviet Union's position, especially strengthening its position in the peace treaties for the five former Nazi satellite states in Europe and future negotiations on peace treaties with Japan and Germany. Meanwhile, French political experts foresee four possibilities for forming a new government: (1) A coalition of the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and the Left Republican Alliance under the leadership of the Communist Party—a revival of the "Popular Front" of 1936. (2) All left-wing parties and the right-wing Republican Alliance, under the leadership of Bidault's Popular Republican Movement, form a reactionary front. (3) Reconstitution of the coalition of the three major parties: the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and the Popular Republican Movement. (4) The three major parties and the Left Republican Alliance organize a national front. Observers believe that if the Communist Party continues to participate in any coalition government, it will demand to assume all important ministerial positions in the new cabinet, including the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Interior, Military Affairs, Labor, Commerce, and Finance.

    法国比道尔政府决定辞职
    法共将负政府重任
    并可遣代表出席四外长会议
    【新华社延安十四日电】各方报导：法国大选结果仍在继续清算中。据合众社报导：由于这次选举结果，人民共和运动党已失去其领导地位，比道尔政府已于十三日决定在新的国民议会十一月二十八日开会时辞职，这一决定可能特使比道尔政府撤回其出席纽约四强会议的资格。目前比道尔系由外次摩维尔代表出席纽约四强会议。共产党执政，将使他们能够派遣自己的代表出席四强会议及安理会，因正将增强苏联的地位，特别是加强其对欧洲五个纳粹前附庸国的和约及将来对日德和约谈判中的地位。同时，法国政治专家预见组织新政府的可能性包括这么四种情形：（一）在共产党领导下的共产党、社会党及左派共和党联盟之联合——一九三六年的“人民阵线”的复活。（二）一切左翼政党及右派共和党联盟，在比道尔人民共和运动领导下，结成反动阵线。（三）重新组成共产党、社会党及人民共和运动三大政党联合。（四）三大政党与左派共和党联盟组织民族阵线。观察家相信共产党继续参加任何联合政府时，势将要求在新内阁中担负一切重要部长职位，其中包括外交、内政、军政、劳工、商务及财政诸部。
