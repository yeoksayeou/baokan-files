　　Our Seven Captured Unarmed Militiamen
    Ingeniously Escape with Full Arms and Ammunition
    Taiyue Third Military Subdistrict Command Calls on All Areas to Learn From Them
    [This newspaper Taiyue 3rd dispatch] When the Chiang Kai-shek troops invaded Wenxi, they captured seven of our unarmed militiamen, attempting to use them by means of all kinds of threats and inducements. However, they remained unmoved. On October 24th, they finally escaped victoriously, each carrying a rifle and over a thousand rounds of ammunition. After they returned, they immediately found their original militia unit and continued to participate in the battle. The Taiyue Third Military Subdistrict Command and the Third Military Commission issued a call to the captured militiamen in all areas to learn from this resolute and resourceful spirit.

　　我被俘七徒手民兵
    带足枪弹机警逃回
    太岳三分区司令部等号召各地学习
    【本报太岳三日电】蒋军在进犯闻喜时，曾抓走我徒手民兵七人，百般威胁利诱，企图加以利用，但他们始终不为所动，十月二十四日终于胜利逃回，每人并携带步枪一支，子弹千余发。他们跑回后，即找到原来的民兵队，继续参加战斗。太岳三分区司令部与武委三分会，特号召各地被抓民兵学习这种坚决机敏的精神。
