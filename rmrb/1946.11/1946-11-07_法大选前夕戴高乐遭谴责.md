Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 4th: A comprehensive report from Paris states: As the French elections approach, various political parties in France are engaged in fierce campaigning. De Gaulle is also traveling extensively, and on the 1st, he issued a declaration calling on voters to "elect candidates who agree to amend the new constitution." In his declaration, he supported the Popular Republican Movement, which advocates for the immediate amendment of the new constitution, and demanded a "strong president with dictatorial power and a weak parliament." After the declaration was issued, Paris parliamentarian Florimond Bonte issued a statement condemning De Gaulle's move as "attempting to gather reactionary forces to organize an anti-democratic crusade, and advising people not to obey the laws of the constitution, which is the fundamental rule of achieving democracy." The Socialist Party also "mildly" condemned De Gaulle for attempting to "hinder democracy."

　　法大选前夕戴高乐遭谴责
    【新华社延安四日电】综合巴黎讯：法国大选前夕，法国各政党正展开激烈的竞选运动。戴高乐亦四出奔波，并于一日发表宣言，要求选民“选举那些赞成修改新宪法的候选人”。他在宣言中，支持主张即刻修改新宪法的人民共和运动党，并要求一个握有独裁的“强有力的总统与软弱的国会两院”。该宣言发出后，巴黎议员佛罗里蒙彭特发表声明，谴责戴高乐此举“为欲收罗反动派组织反民主的十字架，劝人家不要服从宪法的法律乃达成民主的基本法则”。社会党亦“温和”的谴责戴高乐力图“阻碍民主”。
