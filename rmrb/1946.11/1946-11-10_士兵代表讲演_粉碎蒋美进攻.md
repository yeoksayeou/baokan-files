　　Soldier Representatives Speak
　　Crush the Jiang-American Offensive
　　Shen Haizhu, a liberated peasant from Shahe, specially presented General Gao with some teapots and bowls and spoke on stage. He said, "Thank you, Commander-in-Chief Gao, for helping me to turn over and be liberated. I am giving these recovered items to the Commander-in-Chief, and I ask him to always remember us." After the representatives of various organizations and the masses delivered their speeches, General Liao Anbang, the army's deputy commander, thanked the elders and governments at all levels on behalf of the entire army. He said, "The help we receive from all sides is meticulous. But there is not enough criticism of our shortcomings. The People's Army is connected to the Liberated Areas by flesh and blood. Please, elders and governments, strictly criticize us in the future."
　　Finally, three soldier representatives took the stage to speak. They described in excited and joyful tones the improvements in their lives and the freedom they had gained politically after the uprising. Their speeches resonated with all the soldiers. Every soldier remembered that at this time last year, they hadn't even put on their cotton-padded clothes yet. At that time, we put on the cotton clothes late and they were broken very early. The inside felt like a layer of cold cloth, the cotton was damaged and thin, and a poke of the finger would create a hole. But this year, we have already put on brand new, thick cotton-padded clothes. In the past, there was no democracy in the army, and officers often beat and scolded soldiers. Now that democracy has been implemented, not only are they not beaten or scolded, but soldiers can also frequently offer opinions to their superiors. There has been great improvement in our lives. As a statistical cartoon at the meeting stated: In the Jiang-occupied areas, the annual morbidity rate was 75 percent and the mortality rate was 30 percent. After the uprising, the morbidity rate has dropped to 6 percent, and the mortality rate is only 0.3 percent. In the six months before the uprising, there were 5,400 instances of beating and scolding, while statistics for the four months after the uprising showed only eight instances, and it has recently been completely eliminated. Therefore, the soldiers are all radiant and filled with boundless excitement and joy. Therefore, when the three representatives proposed to everyone to "intensify our studies, improve ourselves, prepare to go to the front lines, and fight to the death with Chiang Kai-shek and American imperialism," all the soldiers responded enthusiastically and unanimously. The meeting ended at 9 p.m., with arms raised and the entire audience shouting the slogan "Follow Chairman Mao and crush the Jiang-American offensive," the meeting adjourned. Afterwards, the Fuyang Theater performed a Peking opera to add to the festivities.

　　士兵代表讲演
    粉碎蒋美进攻
    沙河的翻身农民沈海珠，特向高将军献了一些茶壶饭碗，并登台讲话。他说：“感谢高总司令帮助自己翻了身，把这些收回来的东西送给总司令，请他永远记着我们。”各机关、群众代表致词完毕后，由该军副总司令廖安邦将军代表全军向全区父老和各级政府致谢。他说：“各方面对我们的帮助是无微不至，对我们缺点的批评却有些不够，民建军和解放区血肉相连，请父老及政府今后严格批评我们才好。”
    最后是三个士兵代表登台讲话，他们以兴奋愉快的口吻叙述举义后自己的生活上得到改善，政治上得到自由。他们的讲话引起了全体战士的共鸣，每个士兵都想起了去年今日举义的时候，他们还没穿上棉衣。那时候棉衣穿的晚，破的可很早，里面都像层冷布，棉絮又坏又薄，用手指头一戳就是一个窟窿，而今年早已穿上了崭新的厚棉衣了。过去部队里没有民主，官长经常打骂士兵，现在实行了民主，不但不打不骂了，士兵还可以经常给上级提意见。生活更有很大改善。正如会场上的一张统计漫画上所载的一样：在蒋占区时，全年的疾病率占百分之七十五、死亡率占百分之三十；举义后的疾病率已降至百分之六，死亡率才仅千分之三；在起义前六个月内即发生过打骂现象五千四百次，举义后四个月的统计则只有八回，最近已经完全消灭了。因此，士兵们莫不精神焕发，充满了无限的兴奋与喜悦。所以，当他们三个代表向大家提出“加紧学习，提高自己，准备到前线去，和蒋介石、美帝国主义拼命”时，全体战士均一致热烈响应。大会至此已晚间九时，就在万臂高举，全场高呼“跟着毛主席走，粉碎蒋美进攻”的口号下散会。旋由滏阳剧团出演平剧助兴。
