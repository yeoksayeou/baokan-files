　　Anti-Conscription, Anti-Training, and Demobilization Movement in the Chiang Kai-shek Areas

　　I. Chiang Kai-shek Tears Up the Military Reorganization Plan

　　After signing the military reorganization plan in late February, Chiang Kai-shek immediately convened a so-called "Military Reorganization Conference" in Nanjing, tearing it up completely. First, he prepared to retain an additional two million troops using the "Engineering Corps" and projected desertion figures. In June, Chen Cheng publicly announced that "not a single soldier of the National Army has returned to the fields, nor is there any intention to do so"; in July, Nanjing convened a conscription conference to revise the conscription law and intensify the training of conscription personnel, while also massively drafting over 60,000 young men in the Northeast; in September, Chiang's Ministry of National Defense announced the division of the country into seventy-one conscription districts and issued a nationwide order to continue implementing conscription. The division of conscription districts was as follows: Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces, eight districts; Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, and Taiwan Provinces, nine districts; Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Hunan Provinces, twelve districts; Sichuan, Xikang, Yunnan, and Guizhou Provinces, twelve districts; the Longhai Railway and areas north of it, eighteen districts; and the Northeast Provinces, twelve districts, totaling sixty-two division command districts and nine regimental command districts. The above is the actual content of the "Military Reorganization Work Report" and the fundamental reason for the surging development of the anti-conscription, anti-training, and demobilization movement in the Chiang-controlled areas.

　　II. Enormous Conscription Numbers

　　The issuance of this conscription order indicates Chiang Kai-shek's determination to fight the civil war to the death, determined to leave the people with no room for survival. As we know, Henan Province, which had already provided five million conscripts during the War of Resistance Against Japan, was required to conscript 102,000 people in the first phase, to be completed by the end of September. The Nationalist-controlled area of Hebei Province is extremely small, but it was also decided to conscript 80,000 people, with the first phase being 36,975, to be completed by September 28th. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Hubei Province conscripted a total of 710,000 people, of whom only a little over 120 were discharged due to old age, weakness, disability, or death, and none have been seen returning home to date. This time, the first phase of conscription requires 31,500 people, to be completed by October. Although Yunnan Province is relatively far from the war zone, the first phase of conscription also designates over 10,000 people. Based on the above figures, the number of conscripts in the first phase is already very large, and it can be determined that a second phase of conscription will follow soon.

　　III. Various Conscription Schemes in the Chiang Areas

　　There are many methods circulating in the Chiang areas regarding conscription, recruitment, and call-up training of young people. In terms of their nature, they can be divided into five types:

　　1. Deception: For example, on September 22nd, the police substation stationed in Langfang set out armed to the villages of Da Ma and Xiao Ma, about six kilometers southwest of Langfang, and after gathering the villagers by banging gongs and holding meetings, they selected 35 young men, claiming that the city walls of Langfang had collapsed due to rain and ordering them to repair them. Once they arrived, they were confined in a courtyard and began "training." Another example is the North China Pacification Headquarters in Peiping, which announced on September 27th that this conscription "will serve for two years from enlistment and will never participate in combat," but then also repeatedly stated that "this conscription is to supplement the army's vacancies," exposing the deceitful words themselves.

　　2. Enticement: Especially manifested in the recruitment of "unemployed and out-of-school youth to join the army," which is the most widely used method. For example, when no young people signed up for military service, Wang Jigao, director of the Peiping Education Bureau, published a "Letter to Unemployed and Out-of-School Youth," emphasizing that "joining the Youth Army can exempt you from one year of high school training," "the Youth Army has the best treatment," and "after training, you can be recommended to study abroad," and so on, attempting to lure young people to take the bait.

　　3. Buying: The trade in conscripts has now become part of bureaucratic capital. On the walls of Yongan in the sixth district of Tianjin, there are still many colorful advertisements for hiring soldiers, with the highest price being 1.5 million yuan, with several households jointly hiring one soldier. In Peiping, the "under-the-table" price for hiring a soldier now exceeds 3 million yuan, and the district security offices take the opportunity to extort money. For example, an apprentice at the Chunxing Hotel in Peiping was arrested, escaped on the way, and then was demanded back from the hotel, saying, "If there is no person, you must pay 3 million yuan for hiring a soldier."

　　4. Coercion: After assigning the numbers, people are sent to various places to "urge" the delivery of conscripts, and if they are not delivered on time, they are fined heavily. Tianjin recently publicly declared: "If the conscription task cannot be completed on time, the only option is to thoroughly implement conscription," so-called "thorough implementation of conscription" (that is, arresting all eligible young men) has become the capital for "coercing soldiers," under this coercion, it is unknown how many lives have been forced to their deaths! For example, Yin Ting, the chief of the 15th bao of Tangguantun, and Shi Chongwen, the chief of the 5th bao, unable to bear the excessive oppression of the people, one threw himself into a well and the other hanged himself in desperation. After Yin Lanting, a resident of the fourth bao, was conscripted, his mother, Tian, committed suicide by poisoning on September 23rd because her son was conscripted and she had no means of livelihood.

　　5. Seizing: This is the most popular method. On the streets, you often see a rope tied to a dozen young people, none of whom were not seized. The seizures are even more rampant along the edges of our liberated areas. In addition, there are many other methods, such as the "neutral conscription method" implemented in Tianjin, which is the so-called "implementing conscription with the principle of recruitment." In other words, it is "forcing people to buy soldiers." The so-called "neutrality" is nothing more than a combination of "buying and forcing"!

　　IV. The Flames of Resistance are Burning

　　Under the enormous conscription numbers and the conscription methods of deception, enticement, buying, coercion, and seizing, the people in the Chiang-controlled areas universally oppose conscription. To avoid being "conscripted," apprentices in stores ask for leave to flee privately. In Tongxian, Jidong, in just two days, September 25th and 26th, more than 30 shop assistants fled from three stores. According to the Ta Kung Pao on October 4th, "more than 300 young people have fled from stores in the county," and Yongyi Grain Store and Shengli Rice Shop have even closed down; to avoid being conscripted, residents of Tianjin are flocking to the police station to cancel their household registrations; young men in Henan would rather destroy their right eyes and index fingers than join the Chiang army; to avoid being conscripted, large numbers of young men from the Chiang-controlled areas around the liberated areas are fleeing to our areas, their slogan is "If you want to be a soldier, be a Eighth Route Army soldier!" This shows that Chiang Kai-shek's conscription plan has encountered serious difficulties. For example, Shenyang was required to complete the conscription of 6,500 new soldiers by the end of July, but was still not full by the end of August. Tianjin was originally scheduled to complete the conscription of 3,200 soldiers by September 28th, but only a little over one hundred were conscripted by the end of September, and after removing those who were physically unfit, only about forty remained; Peiping was originally scheduled to complete the conscription of 3,200 soldiers by September 28th, but still has not reached one thousand. Students in the Chiang areas universally oppose training. The Kuomintang originally planned to start training college and middle school students across the country on July 1st of this year, but after students and democrats across the country rose up in opposition, they had to announce a postponement, which was a major victory. Originally, Chiang Kai-shek planned to train 100,000 college and middle school students in North China in Tianjin and Shenyang, attempting to use them to participate in the civil war when necessary to make up for the shortage of Chiang's troops in North China. Now we know that the Pre-Military Officer Training Department of Chiang's Ministry of National Defense is actively preparing to start training next year; it plans to divide them into three groups: university graduates will be trained for half a year as second lieutenant reserve officers, high school graduates will be trained for one year as lieutenant reserve officers, and junior high school graduates will be trained for one year as reserve sergeants. This is Chiang Kai-shek's new measure to drive students to fight the civil war, and young people across the country must oppose it!

　　The Kuomintang Youth Army 208th Division was ordered to recruit 30,000 unemployed and out-of-school youth in Peiping, Tianjin, Baoding, Qingdao and Shijiazhuang. Originally scheduled to be completed by September 15th, the plan created by Chiang Kai-shek himself, but to date, even with the "excellent members" sent by the Three People's Principles Youth League included, less than 4,000 people have signed up. Now, in addition to extending the registration period and expanding publicity, the Hebei Provincial Government has also issued an order to all counties to intensify the investigation of unemployed and out-of-school youth aged 16 to 30, supposedly to have them solve "employment" problems in the Youth Army. Chiang's officers and soldiers universally demand demobilization; a group of young people in the 7th Tank Battalion of the Youth Army recently sent a letter to the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao saying that after they arrived in the Northeast, "they were always hoping for demobilization... It has been more than a year since victory, and our hope still cannot be achieved... Today, we can no longer endure it." Hou Tian, a soldier of the New First Army, said with emotion in his longing for demobilization without hope: "Leaving the South for half a year, the words 'demobilization' only add another layer of pain to our memories." The example of the entire 24th Temporary Division of the Yunnan Army refusing to go to the front line and escaping completely is a concentrated manifestation of this torrent of opposition to the civil war and demands for demobilization under the circumstances at the time. In the midst of Chiang Kai-shek's expansion of the civil war, the anti-conscription, anti-training, and demobilization movement that is developing in various parts of the Chiang-controlled areas will be a powerful blow, and it will accelerate Chiang Kai-shek's collapse!

　　蒋区的反征兵
    反集训与要求退伍运动
    一、蒋介石撕毁整军方案
    二月下旬蒋介石签订了整军方案之后，立即在南京召开所谓“整军会议”将它全部撕毁，首先准备用“工兵总队”与预备逃亡数字来额外保留二百万大军。六月陈诚公开宣布“国军至今并未一人解甲归田，且也不准备这样去做”；七月南京召开兵役会议修改兵役法加紧训练兵役人员，同时在东北大事抽抓壮丁六万余人；九月蒋记国防部公布划全国为七十一个兵役管区并通令全国继续实行征兵，兵役管区的划分，计：苏浙两省八个区，粤桂闽台四省九个区，鄂赣皖湘四省十二个区，川康滇黔四省十二个区，陇海线及以北地区十八个区，东北各省十二个区，共计师管区六十二个，团管区九个。以上是“整军工作报告”的实际内容，也是蒋区反征兵反集训与要求退伍运动澎湃发展的根本原因。
    二、庞大的征兵数字
    此次征兵令的下达，表示蒋介石决心要把内战打到死，决心不教人民再有生存的余地，据我们所知抗战期间已出壮丁五百万的河南省，这次第一期征兵就要十万二千名，限令九月底征齐。河北省国民党统治地区极小，然亦决定征兵八万，首期三万六十九百七十五名，限令九月二十八日完成。抗战期间湖北省共出壮丁七十一万，除因老弱残废退伍一百二十余人外，至今未见一人返乡，这次征兵首期也要三万一千五百名，限令十月完成。滇省虽离战区较远，但首期征兵亦指定一万余名。根据以上数字估计，第一期征兵的数目，已经是很大的了，并可断定不久就会来第二期征兵。
    三、蒋区征兵阴谋种种
    蒋区流行着的有关征兵，募兵、召训青年的方法很多，就其性质来说可分五种：
    一、骗：如九月二十二日驻廊坊的警察分所武装出发，到廊坊西南约六公里之大小麻村，鸣锣开会，集齐村民后，由其中选出壮丁三十五名，宣称廊坊城垣因雨塌毁，令彼等前往修理，到后即被幽闭一院开始“训练”。又如北平行辕九月二十七日宣称此次征兵“自入伍起服役二年，决不参加作战，”，但另外又口口声声说“此次征兵是为了补充军队缺额”，骗人之词自行揭穿。
    二、诱：特别表现在对招收“失业失学青年从军”上面，使用最广，如北平市教育局长王季高，当招收青年从军无人报名时，及发表“告失学失业青年书”，强调“参加青年军可以免除高中一年集训”，“青年军待遇最好”“训练后可以保送出国”等等企图勾引青年上钩。
    三、买：现在壮丁兵员的买卖已经成为官僚资本的一部分了，天津市第六区永安墙壁上，现在还贴着不少五光十色的雇兵广告，最高价格一百五十万元，数户共雇一兵。北平现在雇兵一名“暗盘”已超过三百万元，区保公所并借机敲诈，如北平城内春兴酒店学徒被抓，途中逃脱后，复向酒店索人，并称“若没有人须缴雇兵费三百万元”。
    四、逼：派定数目之后，派人到各处“坐催”若不按时送到罚以重款，天津市最近公开宣称：“若不能按时完成征兵任务，只有彻底实行征兵了”，所谓“彻底实行征兵”（即将适龄壮丁全部抓去）也就成为“逼兵”的资本，在这种威逼之下已不知逼死了多少性命！如唐官屯十五保保长尹亭，五保保长石崇文，因不忍过重欺压人民，在威逼无耐下一个投井，一个自缢，第四保住户尹兰亭被征后，尹母田氏因子被征生活无着，九月廿三日服毒自杀。
    五、抓：这是最流行的办法，街上常常看到一条绳子捆着十几个青年，没有一个不是抓来的，向我解放区边沿抓得更凶，此外方法还多，如天津所实行的“中和性征募办法”即所谓“以征兵的原则实行募兵”，换句话说，就是“逼迫买兵”，所谓“中和”也都不过是“买逼”的合用而已！
    四、反抗的怒火在燃烧
    在庞大的征兵数字与骗、诱、买、逼、抓的征兵方法下蒋区的人民普遍反对征兵，为免被“征”商店的学徒，请假私逃，冀东通县仅九月二十五、六两日三家商店就逃走店伙卅余人，依大公报十月四日称：该县商店逃走之青年已愈三百，涌益粮店、胜利米庄因以停业；为免被征天津住户纷纷到警察所办退户口手续；河南青年宁愿毁其右眼与食指也不愿去当蒋军；为免被征，解放区周围蒋区青年大批逃向我区，他们的口号是“要当兵就当八路军！”这就是说蒋介石的征兵计划遭遇到严重困难，如沈阳限七月底完成六千五百新兵，到八月底仍未满额。天津原定九月廿八日完成征兵三千二百，到九月底只征到一百余人，除去体格不合者则只剩四十余人了：北平原定九月二十八日完成征兵三千二百至今仍未足千人。蒋区的学生普遍反对集训，国民党原定本年七月一日开始集训全国大、中学生，后经全国学生与民主人士纷起反对，不得不宣布改期，这是一件很大的胜利。原来蒋介石计划要在天津沈阳集训华北大中学生十万人，企图必要时驱使他们参加内战，以弥补蒋军在华北兵力之不足，现悉蒋记国防部预备军官管训处又在积极筹备，明年开始集训了；拟分三组，大学毕业生集训半年作为中尉预备军官，高中毕业生集训一年作少尉预备军官，初中毕业生集训一年作为预备军士，这是蒋介石驱使学生打内战的新的措施，全国青年必须反对！
    国民党青年军二○八师奉命在平津保青及石家庄招收三万名，蒋介石一手所造成的失学失业青年从军原定九月十五完成，但至目前为止，三青团所派送的“优秀团员”在内，报名者还不足四千，现除延期报名，扩大宣传之外，河北省府复通令各县加紧调查十六至三十岁失学失业的青年，据说是要他们到青年军解决“职业”问题去了。蒋军官兵普遍要求退伍；青年军战车第七营一群青年最近投函天津大公报说，他们到东北之后“总在希望着退伍，……胜利至今已一年多了，我们的希望依旧不能达到……今天我们是忍受得不能再忍受了”。新一军士兵侯恬在渴望退伍无望中感慨的说：“离开南国半年，退伍两字仅使我们回忆时多增一层痛苦”，像滇军暂二十四师全师拒开前线，逃亡一空的例子，正是这种反对内战要求退伍的巨流在当时情况下的集中表现，在蒋介石扩大内战声中，蒋区各地正发展着的反征兵、反集训与要求退伍的运动，将是有力的一击，它将加速蒋介石的溃灭！
