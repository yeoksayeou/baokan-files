　　Increasing Production to Defend Chairman Mao
    Licheng Intensifies Saltpeter Production
    [This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch] The 46 saltpeter workshops in Licheng are stepping up saltpeter production to increase the raw materials for military production and strive for victory in the overall resistance. One-quarter of this winter's task was completed in one month, and many improvements were made in technology and quality. In Xia Village, District One, one pot can produce 25 jin of saltpeter per day, with good quality. In Zheng She Village, one pot produced 800 jin of saltpeter in one month. Recently, after hearing that Chiang's army was attacking the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, the saltpeter workshops launched a movement to defend Chairman Mao. Wang Jingyu of the Xia Village saltpeter workshop said, "The more we produce, the more reactionaries will die." Comrade Wang Fucun, who leads the county's saltpeter workshops, said, "With the efforts of the various saltpeter workshops, it is estimated that at least 20,000 jin will be produced above the plan."

    黎城加紧熬硝
    【本报长治讯】黎城四十六座硝房加紧熬硝，以增加军火生产原料，争取全面抵抗的胜利。一月中已完成今冬任务的四分之一，并在技术上与质量上有许多改进，一区霞庄一口锅每日可出硝二十五斤，成色又好。正社村一月一口锅熬硝八百斤。最近他们听说蒋军进攻陕甘宁边区，各硝房在展开保卫毛主席运动，霞庄硝房王景玉说：“咱熬的越多，反动派死的越多”。领导全县硝房的王富存同志说：“各硝房这样努力，预计至少可超出计划二万斤”。（马琳）
