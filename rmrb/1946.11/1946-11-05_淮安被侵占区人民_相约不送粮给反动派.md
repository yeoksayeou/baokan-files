　　Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 30th—The people in the occupied areas of Huai'an have launched a struggle to protect grain. The masses in various villages of the ×× district have agreed not to send grain to the reactionaries. In addition to each household dispersing and burying their grain, 7,500 people in the entire district transported more than 100,000 jin of public grain to a safe place within three days, causing the Chiang troops to return empty-handed when they went to the villages to loot grain. The masses in × village also transported tens of thousands of jin of public grain that had not been moved by a certain organization to the New Fourth Army garrison and the ×× District Democratic Government overnight,抢运了 sixteen 169,000多 jin of public grain in two nights. A village only one li away from a Chiang army stronghold, upon hearing that the democratic government was collecting public grain, had seven or eight women each carrying dozens of jin, delivering it to the designated location in the dark of night.

　　淮安被侵占区人民
    相约不送粮给反动派
    【新华社华中三十日电】淮安被侵占区人民，展开了护粮斗争，××区各乡群众，相约不送粮给反动派。除由各户将粮疏散埋藏外，全区七千五百人，三天内把十余万斤公粮运至安全地方，蒋军下乡抢粮时扑空而回。×村群众并将某机关未运走的数万斤公粮，连夜运往新四军驻地××区民主政府，在两个夜间抢运了十六万九千多斤公粮。离蒋军据点仅隔一里的某庄，听说民主政府征收公粮，七八个妇女每人担了几十斤，黑夜送到指定地点。
