　　How to Distribute the Fruits of Victory Fairly and Reasonably
　　Lin Fa
　　I. Adhere to the mass line
　　II. Avoid egalitarianism

　　Fair and reasonable distribution of the fruits of struggle is a crucial issue in mobilizing the masses. Often, a struggle proceeds very well, but inappropriate distribution of the fruits affects the morale of the masses. Some comrades think it’s difficult to mobilize the masses for struggle but easy to distribute the fruits; this is not the case. A subjective desire for quick distribution often leads to careless actions and problems. For example, in the great turnaround movement, in Beixiaoguo Village, Xingtai Third District, the village head and the chairman of the armed forces committee almost fought because of inappropriate distribution of the fruits. Therefore, the issue of distributing the fruits of struggle deserves careful study and attention. Here, I will introduce the fruit distribution situation in Nandaguo Village for your reference.

　　First, register all the households in the village clearly and classify their class status to see how many poor peasants, middle peasants, etc., there are. Then, study their family situations to see which households should be allocated land, which should be allocated grain, or all of them. Never adopt an egalitarian approach.

　　In the first distribution of fruits in Nandaguo Village, the class status was not clearly defined, and it was based solely on the amount of land and daily life, rather than on the mode of production, which wrongly classified two tenant farmers as lower-middle peasants. Furthermore, in the distribution of fruits, the actual situation was not considered, and an egalitarian approach was adopted. People could only choose one thing; if they wanted land, they couldn't have houses or anything else. In the land distribution, the method of drawing lots was used, so the desperately poor Hou Delu got three mu of land scattered in three places, and the desperately poor Ning Tingxiang got two mu of land that was remote and poor.

　　After discovering these problems, in the second distribution of fruits, we spent four or five days clarifying the class status and understanding the situation of each family, determining who should get what, and holding special meetings for discussion, publicity, and explanation. We held group meetings to discuss the situation of each family and decide on specific methods. The methods were as follows:

　　I. Principles:
　　(1) Land should be distributed to the desperately poor, tenant farmers, and poor peasants, with priority given to the families of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, and workers.
　　(2) Middle peasants should be allocated items based on the amount of money (furniture should be priced low), so that everyone receives something.
　　(3) Under the above principles, the actual situation of each class and family should be considered for a reasonable distribution.

　　II. Land:
　　(1) The previous distribution should be nullified and distributed together with this time's distribution, because the previous land was all in fragmented plots, which not only made farming inconvenient but also reduced production (large plots were divided into several small plots).
　　(2) The land currently being rented should be left as is as much as possible, with only the documents changed. For example, the tenant farmer Xu Bin, with a family of seven, had two and a half mu of land and rented ten mu of land from the landlord Fan Rushou who was being struggled against. According to the village's average, he should get fourteen mu. Therefore, the ten mu of land he was renting was considered to be distributed to him, and the shortfall would be made up later. If the family has one or two mu more, that would be acceptable, but if it was too much, it could be taken out and distributed to others. This is because the farmers have cultivated the land to be fertile and strong; giving it to others would dampen their enthusiasm for production and struggle.
　　(3) Among the households receiving land, priority should be given to the families of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, and workers, as well as widows and orphans, to receive nearby and good land.
　　(4) Land should be allocated by plots, and整块should not be divided into零块as much as possible. For example, if there is a plot of land of more than three mu, it can be allocated to a household that should get three mu, or it can be allocated to a household that should get four mu; a few cents more or less can be discussed later.
　　(5) Regarding the autumn harvest, if white land is allocated to households, they will not get immediate relief. Therefore: (A) If the land is cultivated by the landlord himself, whoever gets the land will receive the entire harvest and bear the burden; (B) If the land is cultivated by the tenant farmer, the land recipient and the tenant farmer will divide it equally and share the burden equally. After autumn, the land belongs to the land recipient, and the burden is also his.

　　III. Grain:
　　(1) The grain of the hired laborers must be deducted.
　　(2) The desperately poor tenant farmers have nothing to eat right now, so in addition to allocating land, they should also be allocated some grain.
　　(3) Widows, orphans, and the elderly who have no labor force and no land should be allocated more grain if they are allocated land but cannot cultivate it.

　　IV. Housing: Those who have no houses to live in can be allocated houses even if they have been allocated land or other things.

　　V. Furniture: Middle peasants and poor peasants who generally do not receive land should be allocated furniture according to the amount of money they are allocated.

　　One point that needs to be explained here is the distribution of furniture. Because it was subjectively thought that there was not enough time and we wanted to distribute quickly, and we did not find out who needed what, and we were afraid that they would argue over one item, we did not distribute according to needs, but simply arranged all the items in a square and called names to pick them up one by one, whatever they got was what they got, which was obviously not good. Many widows, orphans, and poor people did not have livestock, so they ended up with livestock equipment or useless items. Some poorer people ended up with cheap items. Some well-off households ended up with valuable items. This was very unfair. This lesson is worth learning. To distribute the fruits of victory fairly and reasonably, simply wanting to be quick subjectively will inevitably lead to problems. However, we should not advocate "slow" either. Instead, we should educate our cadres to seize the time and follow the mass line carefully and patiently while trying not to drag out the time as much as possible.

### 如何把果实分得公平合理

　　如何把果实分得公平合理
    林发
    一、要走群众路线
    二、不要以均为公
    公平合理的分配斗争果实，是发动群众重要的问题。往往一个斗争搞的非常好，由于果实分配不当，而影响群众情绪。有的同志认为发动群众斗争难，分配果实容易，其实并非如此。主观上要求快分，往往就要了草从事出毛病。例如此次大翻身运动中，邢台三区北小郭村，因为果实分配不适当，村长和武委会主席几乎打起架来。所以分配斗争果实问题是很值得研究与注意的。这里我把南大郭村这次果实分配的情形介绍给大家以作参考。
    首先把全村户口登记清，并划分出成分来，看有多少贫农中农等，然后再把他家庭情形加以研究，看那些户口该分地，那些户该分粮食，或者全部分，绝不要以均为公。
    南大郭村在第一次分配果实中，就是没有把成分确定好，没有从生产方式上去看，而单从土地数目及日常生活来看，而把两个佃户列为下中农。更在分配果实中不看实际情形，以均为公，反正只能要一样，要地不能要房子，也不能要别的，在分土地时采取捻纸团法，因此赤贫侯得禄三亩地分到三下去，赤贫宁廷祥分了二亩地又远又坏。
    发现这些毛病后，在第二次分配果实时用了四五天工夫，把成分划清，对各家庭情形进行了解，确定谁应分啥，并专门开大会讨论，宣传解释，开小组会讨论各家庭情形，决定具体办法。办法是这样：
    一、原则：
    （一）赤贫、佃户、贫农分土地，其中尤应先照顾烈荣抗工属。
    （二）中农按钱的多少分物件（家俱都以低价合成），都要得到果实。
    （三）要在以上原则下再根据各阶层各家的实际情形进行合情合理的分配。
    二、土地：
    （一）上次分的一律作废和这一次一块分配，因为上次地全是零块，这不仅不便利养种，而且减少生产量（大块分成数小块）。
    （二）租当地尽量不动，只换一下文书。如佃户徐彬，七口人，二亩半地，当被斗地主范如寿地十亩，按本村地平均他应得到十四亩，因此把那十亩地就算分给他，少了以后补充。全家多一二亩也就算了，如果多的过多，可抽出来分给别人。这原因是：种地户把地养的又肥又壮，分给别人打击了他生产与斗争情绪。
    （三）在分地户中，先尽烈荣抗工属及孤寡户分到近地和好地。
    （四）按地块分，尽量不要把整块划分为零块，如有个三亩多的地块，分给一个应分三亩地的户也可，或分给一个应分四亩地的户也可，多几分少几分最后再说。
    （五）秋收问题，如果分给分地户白地，马上得不到救济，因此：（甲）是地主本人种的地，分给谁，谁全收，收的人出负担；（乙）是租当地户的地，分地户和种地户平分，平半摊负担，到秋后地归分地户，负担也归他。
    三、粮食：
    （一）雇工粮食必须除去。
    （二）赤贫佃户刻下没啥吃，除分到地外再分些粮。
    （三）孤寡老弱没有劳动力，也没有土地，分给他地而不能耕种者，要多分粮。
    四、房产：没有房子住的就是分了土地或其他东西也能分房子。
    五、家具：中农和一般分不到地的贫农，按分的钱数，分家具。
    这里需要说明的一点，便是分配家俱具，因为主观上认为时间来不及，想分快点，也没有弄清谁家需要什么，再加上怕他们互相争闹一件东西，因此没有按需要分，而只是把所有的东西统统排列在一个广场上，挨名挨物叫取，碰上啥就是啥，这显然是不很好的。好多孤寡户及穷人没有牲口，就因为这样分碰到牲口套或者车没用的物件。有些穷些的碰的东西是些不值钱的。有些好户碰上值钱的东西。这是非常不公的。这个教训是值得接受的。要公平合理的把果实分配完，单主观上要求快一定要出毛病，但也不能提倡“慢”，而应教育我们干部在尽量不拖长时间的原则下，抓紧时间走群众路线，细心耐心的做这一工作。
