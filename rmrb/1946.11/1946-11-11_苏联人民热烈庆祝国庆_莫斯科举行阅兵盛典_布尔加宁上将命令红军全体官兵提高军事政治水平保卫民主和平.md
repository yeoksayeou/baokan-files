    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 8th: Yesterday, the Soviet people warmly celebrated the great October Revolution Day. A grand military parade was held on Red Square in Moscow, with the Soviet national flag shining above the Kremlin. The stands on Red Square were crowded with representatives of the Supreme Soviet, Stakhanovite workers from various factories, generals, scientists, artists, writers, collective farm peasants, and other distinguished guests. Divisions and regiments of various military branches stood in rectangular formations on the square. When the leaders of the CPSU Central Committee and the Soviet government walked to the rostrum, the applause was like a thunderclap. Marshal Govorov of the Soviet Union, the parade inspector, appeared on horseback. After the salute, he first inspected the mixed officer corps representing the armed forces of various military branches, followed by the Frunze Military Academy, which had been awarded the Order of the Red Banner, the Order of Lenin, and the Order of Suvorov. Behind them were the Artillery Academy, the Armored Mechanized Forces Academy, the Aviation Military Engineering Academy, and then the queen of the battlefield - the infantry, followed by the cavalry, which galloped past with an irresistible lightning posture. After a roar of engines, the artillery entered the field, including various types and calibers of artillery, anti-tank, rapid-fire, anti-aircraft and other heavy curved-fire guns, as well as mechanized units, the Soviet "steel cavalry," bicycle machine teams, and an endless stream of automobiles carrying mechanized infantry and paratroopers. The final rear guard was the "Stalin" heavy tank. This review is a vivid demonstration of the strength of the Soviet army, which is more experienced after the Second World War. They are now studying combat experience and vigilantly guarding peace and the fruits of the Soviet people's construction.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 8th: Moscow Dispatch: General Bulganin, Deputy Minister of the Soviet Armed Forces, issued an order to all officers and soldiers yesterday (7th), the October Revolution Day, stating: "The Soviet people are welcoming the 29th anniversary of the October Revolution in the midst of the tense peaceful labor of implementing the task of post-war reconstruction. In order to complete production plans ahead of schedule, workers have launched extensive socialist competitions, and farmers are also carrying out patriotic movements to exceed the quota of grain deliveries. Soviet intellectuals are also working selflessly. The Soviet people are striving to restore industry and agriculture to pre-war levels, ensure that the industrial sector reaches new heights, and greatly improve their material lives next year."
    The order pointed out: "The Soviet Union's peace-loving foreign policy has won the sympathy and support of the people of all countries because this policy is in line with their vital interests. No matter how international reactionaries resist peace, democratic peace is guaranteed." The order continued to emphasize: "The task undertaken by the Soviet armed forces is to defend democratic peace, defend the creative labor of our people, and firmly defend the Soviet state." The order called on soldiers across the country to "fully understand their military obligations, constantly improve their military and political level, and there should be no complacency or indifference in our ranks. The combat readiness of the Soviet armed forces is a guarantee of peace and the safety of the people of all countries. We should constantly study the experience of the Great Patriotic War and military science and technology, and abide by the code of conduct, which is the unshakable law of the armed forces. The efforts of all Soviet soldiers will be rewarded."
