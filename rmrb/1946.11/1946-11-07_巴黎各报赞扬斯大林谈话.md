Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, November 2nd: According to Reuters, Paris, October 29th: Stalin's statement to the President of the Associated Press on the current situation has been widely praised here. It is regarded as a symbol of Moscow's willingness to reduce tensions between the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States. Observers here believe that Stalin's declaration on the future of Germany is intended to align the French government's policy with that of Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, November 3rd: TASS, Moscow, November 2nd: General attention is focused on Chairman Stalin's response to questions raised by the President of the Associated Press, Mr. Bailei. Most Paris newspapers have published articles commenting on it. The Radical Party newspaper believes that "the great significance of Stalin's statement is for peace." L'Humanité stated: "Marshal Stalin's statement on the German issue is consistent with French interests." The Socialist Party's Le Populaire said: "Stalin's statement poured cold water on the addled brains of warmongers." Stalin's sincere answer demonstrates that the Soviet Union does not need diplomatic embellishments to express its strength of conviction. L'Aube stated: "The long-term foreign policy formulated by Stalin can be understood not only by professional diplomats but also by millions of ordinary people."

In Poland, the Warsaw Daily emphasized that the response mentioned that Poland's western border "has been determined." In Germany, the Berlin "Daily News" issued an extra edition with Stalin's response published under a large headline.

　　巴黎各报赞扬斯大林谈话
    【新华社延安二日电】据路透社巴黎十月二十九日讯：斯大林答复合众社社长的时局声明，在此间得到广泛的赞许。被认为是莫斯科愿意减除苏联与英美间之紧张的象征。此间观察家认为斯大林对德国未来的宣言，是来使法政府政策与英苏美一致。
    【新华社延安三日电】塔斯社莫斯科二日电：各国一般注意力皆集中于斯大林委员长对合众社社长白理所提出的问题之答复，大部分巴黎报纸皆著文评论。急进党报纸认为“斯大林声明之伟大意义是为了和平”。人道报称：“斯大林元帅对德国问题之声明是与法国利益一致的。”社会党的大众报说：“斯大林之声明是对战争挑拨者的冲昏了的头脑浇了一盆冷水。”斯大林的诚恳答复，说明苏联并不需要外交上的渲染来表示其力量观念。斯坎塔报称：“斯大林制定的长期外交政策，不仅对职业外交家而且对千百万老百姓都能理解的。”
    在波兰，华沙日报强调该答复中提及波兰西疆“已经确定了”。在德国，柏林“每日新闻”增发号外，以大标题刊载斯大林的答复。
