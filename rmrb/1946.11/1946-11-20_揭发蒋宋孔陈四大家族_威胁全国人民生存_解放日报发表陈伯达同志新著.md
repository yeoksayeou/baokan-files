    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th. *Liberation Daily* has been continuously publishing the latest work of the famous Chinese commentator Chen Boda, *The Four Big Families of China*, since the 13th. The book contains more than 60,000 words. The book points out that the one-party dictatorship of the Kuomintang or the dictatorship of the big landlord and big bourgeoisie of China is in fact the Chiang family of Chiang Kai-shek, the Soong family of Soong Tzu-wen, the Kung family of Kung Hsiang-hsi, and the Chen family of the Chen Guofu and Chen Lifu brothers, with the Chiang Kai-shek family at the head, rule over all the people of China. According to the results of calculations based on various reliable materials in the book, the four families, in the form of "official" and "business," monopolize property in finance, commerce, industry, agriculture, real estate, news publishing, and other fields, as well as their deposits and properties abroad, which should be at least approximately 2,000,000,000 US dollars. After analyzing all the important facts, the author asserts that the four big families of China started their fortunes by relying on counter-revolutionary civil war, economic monopoly, and forced purchase of comprador munitions and other foreign goods. Therefore, it is impossible to expect them to abandon the civil war, abandon the dictatorship, and not be tools of American imperialism. The four big families, relying on the assistance of foreign financial capital, ruthlessly gather the wealth of the entire China, threatening the survival of every person in China. This is a thoroughly rotten feudal-comprador oligarchy. "No matter how perverse, heinous, and desperate it may be, it is digging its own grave, and its life is completely incurable. The people will surely become the masters of an independent, peaceful, and democratic China. This is an irresistible law of history, because the power of people's awakening is irresistible."

    揭发蒋宋孔陈四大家族
    威胁全国人民生存
    解放日报发表陈伯达同志新著
    【新华社延安十七日电】解放日报十三日起，连续刊载中国著名评论家陈伯达的最新著作《中国四大家族》，全书计六万余言，书中指出国民党一党专政或中国大地主大资产阶级独裁，实即蒋介石的蒋家，宋子文的宋家，孔祥熙的孔家与陈果夫、陈立夫兄弟的陈家，而以蒋介石为首的四大家族对全中国人民的统治。该书根据各种可靠材料计算的结果，指出四大家以“官”“商”形式，在金融、商业、工业、农业、地产、新闻出版事业等各方面所独占的财产，以及他们在外国的存款和产业，至少当在二百万万美元左右。作者在分析一切重要事实之后，断言中国四大家族是依靠反革命内战、经济独占与强迫买办军火及其他外国商品起家的，因此希望他们放弃内战，放弃独裁，与不作美帝国主义的工具，乃是一定不可能的。四大家族依靠外国金融资本的援助，极无情地集全中国的财富，威胁全中国每一个人民的生存，这是腐烂透顶的封建买办寡头统治，“不管它还如何倒行逆施，穷凶极恶，但都是自掘坟墓，其生命已完全不可救药，而人民必将成为独立和平民主的全中国的主人翁，这是历史的不可抵抗的规律，因为人民觉悟的力量是不可抵抗的。”
