　　Jiang's Troops in Hongdong Rape, Plunder
　　People Flee to Our Area
　　"Central Army, made in America, brings misery wherever it goes. The Japanese devils were bad enough, but these bandits are even worse!"
　　This is a popular folk song in the Jiang-occupied area of Hongdong. Currently, the people in the Jiang-occupied area of Hongdong are suffering from the cruel ravages of Jiang's troops. In Jicun, a large number of houses were demolished by Jiang's troops, and the bricks, tiles, and door panels were used to build fortifications. More than one hundred peasant households were robbed, leaving them with only seven quilts. On the 18th, Jiang's troops, in the most barbaric manner, raped a fifteen-year-old high school student and two nineteen-year-old women in the village. After the rapes, they were taken to Dayang and Baicun. Even the wife of Ji Zhishan, a Kuomintang Youth League special agent, was raped. In Huangzhuang, Jiang's troops ate all the old chickens and then killed the chicks. In Qudi Village, an old man had more than two hundred bolts of cloth taken away, which made him cry and curse in anger. He was then severely beaten. After the peasant Li Shiming's property was robbed, he had no way to make a living and hanged himself. As a result, the masses are constantly fleeing into the liberated areas. Our democratic government is now sending a large number of cadres to properly appease and provide relief.

　　洪洞蒋军奸淫抢掠
    人民纷纷逃来我区
    中央军美国造，所到之处百姓糟，本来日寇就不好，来的这伙子土匪更糟糕！
    这是普遍流行在洪洞蒋占区的一首歌谣。目前洪洞蒋占区的人民，正遭受着蒋军残酷的蹂躏。吉村大量房屋被蒋军拆毁，砖瓦门板修了碉堡。一百多户农民被抢劫的只剩下七条被子。十八日蒋军以最野蛮的行为，在该村奸淫十五岁的一个高小生，及两个十九岁的妇女，强奸后，又带到大阳、柏村。蒋记三青团特务吉芝山自己的老婆同样也遭强奸了。黄庄蒋军把老鸡吃光了，又杀小鸡。劬底村一老乡二百余个布，被拿走了，气得痛哭大骂。又被痛打一顿。农民李拾命财物被抢光后，生活无着上吊死了。因此群众不断逃入解放区。我民主政府，现正派出大批干部妥为安抚与救济中。
