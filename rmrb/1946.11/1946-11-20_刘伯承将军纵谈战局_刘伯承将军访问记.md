General Liu Bocheng, commander of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Military Region, revered by the Chinese people as a brilliant strategist, recently orchestrated the great victory at Juye. Since August, General Liu has personally led hundreds of thousands of troops from the border region across the vast plains of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan, advancing and retreating strategically, and achieving victory after victory. In total, the Nationalist troops annihilated in the border region amount to thirteen and a half brigades and twenty-one security regiments, with over 40,000 officers and soldiers captured, including division commander (formerly army commander) Zhao Xitian.

After the great victory at Juye, this reporter rushed to a certain location on the front lines to meet with General Liu and convey the congratulations and respect of the Xinhua News Agency headquarters. General Liu was in high spirits and discussed the current war situation with the reporter. The general's remarks were insightful and profound, and full of wit.

"In the past three months, we have exchanged seventeen empty cities in Hebei, Shandong, and Henan for more than 60,000 of Chiang Kai-shek's troops," General Liu said with a smile. "It is said that Chiang Kai-shek thinks this is a good deal and wants to keep doing it. Well, let him do it. In the near future, the final reckoning will come!"

General Liu believes that the victory or defeat of a war depends on the preservation or loss of the main forces. If people are preserved but territory is lost, the territory can still be regained. If territory is preserved but people are lost, both people and territory will inevitably be lost. The Juye campaign is a case in point. After we annihilated the Nationalist army's main force on the western front, the 3rd Reorganized Division and the 47th Division, totaling four brigades, the Nationalist army's entire western front collapsed, and its left flank occupying Dongming had to retreat, and Dongming returned to our hands. Therefore, when the main force of the Nationalist army is annihilated to a certain extent, the Nationalist army will not only be unable to attack, but also unable to defend. Under the attack of our preserved superior forces, they will eventually spit out all the towns and cities they have occupied. General Liu believes that this situation is approaching day by day. After annihilating a considerable number of the Nationalist army's main forces, the situation for our army to launch a large-scale counter-offensive will emerge. Then, General Liu used the changes on the front line of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan to illustrate this principle. Of the twenty-two brigades of the Kuomintang army's Wang Jingjiu Group (nine brigades), Liu Ruming Group (six brigades), and Sun Zhen Group (seven brigades) on the Hebei, Shandong, and Henan front, we annihilated three and a half brigades of the Liu Ruming Group, four brigades of the Sun Zhen Group, and also eliminated approximately 10,000 men from the Wang Jingjiu Group. The remaining Nationalist army has fifteen brigades, of which eight brigades have also been heavily damaged by us. General Liu said, "See how many eight brigades Chiang Kai-shek has, how many 60,000 men he has. If he is willing, I can definitely use a few more empty cities to exchange for his second nine brigades, his third nine brigades, his second 60,000 men, and his third 60,000 men."

General Liu further pointed out incisively that stubbornly defending a city or a piece of land is tantamount to carrying a burden. If we do not resolutely abandon certain towns and cities when necessary, then we will be forced to disperse our forces, defend everywhere, and be beaten everywhere. General Liu called this tactic the "bull butting horns" tactic, the "being beaten" tactic, and the "dead pig not afraid of boiling water" tactic. General Liu said with a smile:

"But we threw these burdens away, and Chiang Kai-shek picked them up and carried them on his back. The more he carries, the heavier he becomes, and the more he cannot move. Of the fifteen brigades remaining in the Nationalist army in Hebei, Shandong, and Henan, ten brigades are forced to defend seventeen empty cities, leaving only five brigades as mobile forces. If the Nationalist army reduces its garrison forces and increases its mobile forces, then the danger of the garrison troops being annihilated by us one by one will be even greater. If it reduces its mobile forces and increases its garrison forces, then it will be unable to conduct operations. Conversely, because our army has no burden of defending towns and cities, our troops are concentrated and mobile, and can attack and annihilate any point with superior forces at any time. This contradiction is extremely difficult for the Kuomintang army to resolve. This situation best illustrates that the Nationalist army's forces are extremely dispersed, its offensive has reached its peak, and its strategic initiative has begun to turn into passivity." General Liu said profoundly and humorously, "The cities and bunkers temporarily occupied by the Nationalist army are our best containment forces. They are tightly besieging the Nationalist army there, waiting for us to eliminate them one by one!"

When the reporter mentioned that the Nationalist army was adopting a tactic of advancing side by side and consolidating step by step, General Liu believed that it could only be effective if the forces were very sufficient. However, the Nationalist army's forces are now extremely weak. After the Nationalist army's main forces, the 5th Army and the 11th Reorganized Division, suffered setbacks a month ago, they scraped together only two brigades of the exhausted 75th Reorganized Division, and there have been no reinforcements since. With its existing forces, the Nationalist army must concentrate on both attacking and defending the occupied towns and protecting the long supply lines, which is like trying to "have both the bear's paw and the fish!" The result will inevitably be that it cannot attend to everything, which is Chiang Kai-shek's insurmountable fatal weakness. The current Juye campaign is a perfect example.

General Liu admitted that the Nationalist army's firepower was quite strong, but he believed that because our army fought at night and suddenly approached to engage in bayonet combat, the fighting relied entirely on bayonets and hand-to-hand combat, and the Nationalist army's heavy weapons were almost useless. In particular, the Nationalist army's morale is very low, and in every battle, many soldiers lay down their weapons. Therefore, even with American equipment, it cannot change its inevitable fate of defeat.

At this point, General Liu particularly pointed out that one of the main reasons for our army's victory is that our army has strong morale. This is because we are waging a just war of self-defense, and the soldiers are all people who have turned themselves around. They are fighting to defend the fruits of their liberation, so they all fight bravely and advance without fear, each one being equal to ten. General Liu especially praised the soldiers who defended Longwangzhuang, who fought against many with few, and although the enemy's offensive firepower was like a sea of fire, they held their ground for eleven days and nights, never retreating a single step, and completed the tasks assigned by their superiors. General Liu believes that this also shows that if we must defend a certain point, we cannot be breached.

General Liu's great contribution to the Chinese revolution in military affairs has long been praised both at home and abroad, and his brilliant vision, meticulousness, and rigor in guiding every war are especially admired by every officer and soldier. A certain senior military cadre on the front lines said: In the Nationalist army's operations, its commander is more likely to be General Liu than Bai Chongxi or Chen Cheng.

Although General Liu's life on the front lines is extremely tense and arduous, his spirit is as vigorous as ever. He personally directs every important battle directly on the front lines. In the intervals between battles, he still engages in translation work, and his desk is piled high with various books and documents.

    刘伯承将军纵谈战局
    刘伯承将军访问记
    穆之
    为中国人民誉为天才战略家的晋冀鲁豫军区司令员刘伯承将军，最近又创造了鄄城大捷的杰作。自八月以来，刘将军亲率边区数十万健儿驰骋于广阔的冀鲁豫平原，纵横进退，所向披靡。总计蒋军在边区被歼灭者凡十三个半旅，二十一个保安团，被俘者有师长（原军长）赵锡田以下官兵四万余名。
    鄄城大捷后，记者趋赴前线某地访晤刘将军，并转达新华社总社之祝贺及敬意。刘将军精神焕发，当为记者纵谈目前战争之形势。将军议论精辟深邃，而谐趣横生。
    “三个多月来，我们以冀鲁豫十七座空城，换得蒋介石六万多人”，刘将军微笑的说：“据说蒋介石认为这是一个好买卖，还要坚持做下去，好罢，让他做下去吧，在不久的将来，就会算出总账来的！”
    刘将军认为战争的胜负决定于主力之保存或丧失，存人失地，地仍可得；存地失人，必将人地皆失。巨野战役即为一例。当我歼灭蒋军西线主力整三师及四十七师共四个旅后，蒋军西线全线崩溃，其占领我东明之左翼也不得不撤退，东明重归我手。因此，蒋军主力在我消灭到一定程度时，蒋军将不仅无力进攻，也将无力可守。在我保存的优势兵力攻击之下，终将所占城镇全部吐出来。刘将军认为目前此种形势已日益接近，再消灭相当数目的蒋军主力，我军大举反攻的局面即将出现。接着，刘将军用冀鲁豫前线的变化来说明了这个道理。冀鲁豫前线的国民党军王敬久集团九个旅，刘汝明集团六个旅，孙震集团七个旅，共二十二个旅，其中被我歼灭者有刘汝明集团三个半旅，孙震集团四个旅，王敬久集团亦被我消灭约一万人。现存国民党军十五个旅，而其中八个旅也已被我所重创。刘将军说：“看蒋介石能有多少个八个旅，能有多少个六万人，如果他愿意，我一定还可再拿几个空城换得他的第二个九个旅，第三个九个旅，第二个六万人，第三个六万人。”
    刘将军更精辟的指出，死守一城一地，无异自背包袱，如果我们不在必要时毅然放弃某些城镇，那么我们就将被迫分散兵力，处处防守，而处处挨打。刘将军称这种战法为牛抵角战术，挨打战术，死猪不怕开水烫的战术。刘将军笑着说：
    “可是我们把这些包袱丢掉了，而蒋介石却拾起来背上了。他背得越多，他就越重，就越走不动。蒋军在冀鲁豫现仅残存的十五个旅中，有十个旅就被迫困守着十七个空城，仅余五个旅可作机动部队。如果蒋军减少守备兵力，增强机动兵力，那么守备部队被我个个歼灭的危险就更大。如果减少机动兵力，增强守备兵力，那么就无法进行作战。相反，我军因无防守城镇之累，部队集中机动，随时可以优势兵力攻击与歼灭其任何一点。这一个矛盾，国民党军是极难解决的。这种形势最好的说明了蒋军的兵力已极度分散，其攻势已达顶点，其在战略上的主动已开始转入被动”。刘将军极深刻而又诙谐的说：“蒋军暂时占领的那些城市与碉堡，都是我们最好的箝制部队，它们替我们把蒋军紧紧的围困在那里，等待我们一个个去消灭呢！”
    记者谈及蒋军采取齐头并进，稳扎稳打的战术时，刘将军认为只有兵力十分充足，方能收其效果。但今日蒋军兵力已极空虚，一个月前蒋军主力第五军及整十一师遭受挫败后，东拚西凑，仅调来整七十五师两个旅的疲惫之师，以后即再无补充。蒋军以现有兵力，既要集中进攻，又要集中防守占领之城镇及保护漫长的的补给线，是“熊掌与鱼不可兼得！”其结果必为顾此失彼，这正是蒋介石不可克服的致命弱点。此次鄄城战役正是一个最好的例子。
    刘将军承认蒋军火力颇强，但他认为由于我军夜间作战及突然迫近进行白刃格斗，战斗全凭刺刀肉搏，蒋军的重兵器，几陷于无用之地。尤其蒋军士气很低，每次战斗，很多放下武器。因此纵有美式装备，也无法改变其必然失败的命运。
    至此，刘将军特别指出我军胜利的主要原因之一，在于我军士气旺盛，这是因为我们是正义自卫的战争，士兵都是翻了身的人民，他们为保卫自己的翻身果实而战，因此在战斗中莫不奋勇向前，以一当十。刘将军特别赞扬守卫龙＠集的战士，他们以寡敌众，敌人进攻的火力虽有如一片火海，而他们坚守阵地达十一昼夜，始终未后退一步，完成了上级的任务。刘将军认为这也说明了如果我们必要坚守那一点时，我们是不可被攻破的。
    刘将军在军事上对中国革命的伟大贡献，早为中外所称颂，而他对每一个战争的指导，英明远识，谨严缜密，尤为每一个将士所叹服。前线某高级军事干部说：蒋军作战，其指挥官与其说是白崇禧、陈诚，母宁说是刘将军。
    刘将军在前线，生活虽极紧张劳苦，而精神奕奕，一如平日，每一重要战斗，必亲临前线直接指挥。于战斗间隙中，犹从事译著，各种图书文件，满积案头。
