　　Setting up a “Classroom” for the Chiang Army
    Ruo Qi
    On the 31st, our armed propaganda team stepped into Panxi Ferry, which the Chiang army was attacking. Every comrade was working hard under the morning sun. Comrades from the leaflet group were busy selecting every eye-catching big tree, gently scraping off the rough bark, applying paste, and carefully pasting the leaflets. Comrades from the slogan group were either buying lime or scraping soot from the bottom of pots in the homes of the villagers. An old lady curiously asked, "What are you scraping this for?" The comrades patiently explained: Scraping soot to write and draw, to make Chiang Kai-shek's soldiers homesick, to tell them not to sell their lives for Chiang Kai-shek and fight a civil war. If there is no civil war, we, the common people, will have a good and peaceful life. Her child pulled the comrades' hands, pointing to the big pot in the kitchen, saying, "There's a lot of soot in this pot!" While the bandits of the Chiang family were still robbing grain and leading away cattle in the south of the village, and shells were constantly falling on the east of the village, and American-made planes were circling overhead, our leaflets and slogans were plastered all over the trees and walls. Yuan Chunfa and Ji Shaoting wrote more than thirty slogans in one breath. After the sound of cannons, the old lady leaned on the door railing, curiously watching us. The old man and the naughty children surrounded us, gesticulating and discussing. Two merchant-like figures watched from the side, reciting, "Welcome... invading army... officers and soldiers to come with guns!" "Nationalist army officers and soldiers can only oppose the civil war... to... ." An old man smiled and said, "These are our Eighth Route Army comrades teaching old Chiang's people to learn!"

　　为蒋军布置“课堂”
    若奇
    三十一日，我们武装宣传组踏进蒋军正在进攻的潘溪渡，朝阳下每个同志紧张地工作着。传单组的同志们，在忙着选择每一株惹人注目的大树，轻轻地刮去粗皮，抹上浆糊，细心地把传单贴上。标语组的同志们，有的去买石灰，有的去老乡家里刮锅底黑，一个老太太好奇地问：“你刮这干啥？”同志们耐心地在解释：刮锅底黑写字画画，叫蒋介石的兵看着想家，叫他们不要替蒋介石卖命打内战。不打内战咱老百姓好过安生日子。她的孩子拉着同志们的手，指着厨房的大锅说：“这锅底多哩！”当蒋家的匪徒们还在村南面抢粮牵牛，炮弹不断地向村东头落、美造飞机也在上空盘旋时，我们的传单标语却涂遍贴满在树上与墙头。袁春发和纪少亭一口气就写了三十多条标语。炮声过后，老大娘扶在门栏间，好奇的看着我们，老大爷和顽皮的小孩子，围绕着我们在指手画脚地议论着。两个商人模样的在一边看，一边念：“欢迎……进犯军……官兵带枪过来！”“国军官兵只有反对内战……才能……。”一位老大爷听了笑嘻嘻的说：“这是俺八路军同志们叫老蒋的人学习哩！”
