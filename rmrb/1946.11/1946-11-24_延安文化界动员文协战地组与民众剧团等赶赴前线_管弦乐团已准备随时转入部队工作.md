　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th—To defend Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia and Yan'an, Yan'an's cultural circles have been mobilized. The People's Theater Troupe went to the southern front a few days ago to perform. The Peking Opera Theater is also using folk forms to arrange small dramas with wartime content. The Cultural Work Office is drawing wartime "magic lanterns" (i.e., peep shows) today and compiling a small-scale Yangko dance – "Go to the Front Again," depicting demobilized soldiers re-enlisting. The orchestra, with the theme of defending Yan'an, preventing spies, and clearing the fields, has created a large number of songs, which will soon be broadcast on Yan'an Xinhua Radio Station. Each member of the orchestra carries a light musical instrument to switch to work in the troops at any time. The literary and art group of the Northwest Cultural Work Troupe is preparing to carry out activities in the urban area and on the battlefield. The Literary Association's war zone literary work team, led by Lin Shan, will depart within days. The Xinhua News Agency and the Liberation Daily have also organized war zone interview teams, which will go to the front soon.
