　　Chiang Kai-shek Represents a Lackey's Demeanor
    Liberation Daily One-Day Commentary
    When the U.S. military's presence in China was condemned at the United Nations General Assembly, as expected, the representative of the Chiang Kai-shek government hurriedly came out to defend its "foreign daddy"! The Chiang Kai-shek government representative's statement on the 29th fully exposed its lackey demeanor.
    Chiang's representative said that the U.S. military's presence in China "does not violate the UN Charter," which is a blatant lie. The UN Charter clearly states in its preamble that "all Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations." The U.S. military's infringement upon China's sovereignty and trampling upon our compatriots, directly assisting Chiang's army in the civil war in the Northeast and elsewhere, its atrocities are too numerous to count. In the past year, according to extremely incomplete statistics, in Shanghai alone, 1,866 of our compatriots were killed or injured. In the past year, U.S. imperialism has used $400 million worth of war materials to help Chiang Kai-shek, enabling the Chiang government to launch a nationwide civil war. Is this not "the threat or use of force" and "infringement upon the territorial integrity or political independence of a member state"? Is this not a "threat to peace"? What does this have in common with the UN Charter?
    The Chiang government representative said that this was "with China's consent," but as everyone knows, as early as June of this year, 110,000 people in Shanghai demonstrated and marched against American interference in China's internal affairs, demanding that the U.S. military withdraw from China immediately. From late September to the present, hundreds of mass organizations and the vast majority of people have participated in the "U.S. Military Get Out of China" movement, and sent telegrams to the UN Security Council and other international organizations, demanding that the United Nations stop the United States from interfering in China's internal affairs and withdraw its troops. Ninety-nine point nine percent of China's 450 million people are firmly opposed to the U.S. military's presence in China. The so-called "consent" only comes from Chiang Kai-shek, only from the four or five families of Chiang Kai-shek and his ilk. How can such a small handful of people represent China?
    The crux of the China problem is U.S. imperialism interfering in China's internal affairs, and the Chiang Kai-shek government, supported by U.S. imperialist military and financial power, implementing a traitorous, dictatorial, and civil war policy. This is the difficulty that prevents China from embarking on the path of independence, democracy, and peace. The Chiang government representative's statement attempts to deceive the world and attribute the "difficulties" to the Chinese Communist Party, which is like burying one's head in the sand, trying to hide something that is already obvious. We, the Chinese people, insist on appealing to the UN General Assembly to instruct the U.S. authorities to abide by the UN Charter, stop interfering in China's internal affairs, stop military and economic aid to the Chiang Kai-shek government, stop the civil war, and withdraw all U.S. troops stationed in China.

### 蒋介石代表的奴才相  解放日报一日时评

　　蒋介石代表的奴才相
    解放日报一日时评
    当联合国大会上，美军驻华受到谴责时，果然不出一般人士所料，蒋介石政府的代表，便急忙出来为其“洋爸爸”辩护了！蒋介石政府代表二十九日的一纸声明，十足暴露了它的奴才相。
    蒋氏代表说：美军驻华“不违反联合国宪章”，实是撒天大谎。联合国宪章中，开宗明义就写着“各会员国在其国际关系上，不得使用威胁或武力，或以与联合国宗旨不符之任何其他方法，侵害任何会员国，或国家之领土完整，或政治独立”。驻华美军之侵害我国主权，蹂躏我国同胞，在东北等地，直接帮助蒋军内战，其暴行数不胜数。在过去一年中，据极不完全的统计，仅上海一地，即打死打伤我国同胞一千八百六十六人。美帝国主义在过去一年中，已以四十万万美元的战争物资帮助蒋介石，以致蒋政府能发动蔓延全国的内战。这不是“使用威胁或武力”，“侵害会员国，或国家之领土完整或政治独立”！？这不是“对和平之威胁”？这与联合国宪章，有什么共同之点？
    蒋政府代表说，这是“经中国之同意”的，但是尽人皆知，早在今年六月间上海即有十一万人示威游行，反对美国干涉中国内政，要求美军立即退出中国，而在九月下旬至今，有数百个群众团体与广大人民参加“美军退出中国”运动，并致电联合国安理会等国际组织，要求制止美国干涉中国内政与撤退美军。我国四万万五千万人中的百分之九十九点九，是坚决反对美军驻华的，所谓“同意”云云，仅只是蒋介石，只是蒋介石辈四五个家族而已。这么一小撮人，如何能代表中国？
    中国问题的症结，就是美帝国主义干涉中国内政，就是在美帝国主义军事与财政支撑下的蒋介石政府，实行卖国独裁内战政策；这就是中国迄今未走上独立、民主、和平的困难之所在。蒋政府代表的声明，企图一手遮天，把“困难”归咎于中国共产党，实是掩耳盗铃，欲盖弥彰。我们中国人民坚持申请联合国大会，责成美国当局遵守联合国宪章，停止干涉中国内政，停止军事上，经济上援助蒋介石政府，进行内战，撤退一切驻华美军。
