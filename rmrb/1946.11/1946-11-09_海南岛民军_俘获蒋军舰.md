    Captures Chiang Kai-shek's Warship
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 6th: Since the Kuomintang withdrew the regular 46th Division from Hainan Island to engage in the civil war, the people's armed forces on Hainan Island have become increasingly active. The October 7th News Report revealed: The island has now become a world of people's armed activities. Highways and bridges have all been destroyed, and the railway from Yulin Port to Beili is even more severely damaged. Land transportation has almost completely stopped, and the Hai Xing warship, which belongs to the Kuomintang Naval Commissioner's Office in Yulin Port, has also been captured recently. Currently, the people's armed forces are taking the initiative to attack, and their momentum is growing stronger.
