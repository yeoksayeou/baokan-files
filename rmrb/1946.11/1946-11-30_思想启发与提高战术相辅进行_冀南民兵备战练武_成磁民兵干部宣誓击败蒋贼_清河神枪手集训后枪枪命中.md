　　Ideological Education and Improved Tactics Complement Each Other
    Jinnan Militia Prepare for War and Practice Martial Arts
    Chengci Militia Cadres Vow to Defeat Bandit Chiang
    Qinghe Sharpshooters Achieve Perfect Accuracy After Training
    [Report from our correspondent in Weixian on the 25th] In order to smash Chiang Kai-shek's offensive and strive for victory in the overall resistance, the militia in Jinnan are training hard and actively preparing to launch guerrilla warfare. The Jinnan Military Commission recently trained 71 county and district military commission cadres for one and a half months, improving their military skills and strengthening their confidence to overcome the most difficult stage and get over the mountain. In Weixian, Jinnan, more than 10,000 liberated peasants have joined the militia and armed themselves, forming squads, platoons, companies, and detachments. Most cadres above the platoon level and demolition personnel have completed training, and militiamen in various villages in the Eighth District have begun practicing martial arts. In order to adapt to the war, the city of Daming has reorganized its institutions, defined wartime tasks and discipline, and convened more than 300 activists to carry out war mobilization, preparing for self-defense warfare. In Chengci, more than 70 militia squad and platoon cadres were convened for training. Everyone enthusiastically studied guerrilla warfare and mine warfare. After discussing current affairs, they all made the following oath: "I am an armed force to protect the poor and protect my own liberation. I know that Chiang Kai-shek and the feudal landlords are vicious and shameless. I swear to never surrender, never hand over my gun, and never compromise, and resolutely fight Chiang Kai-shek, feudal landlords... and special agents to the end!" Now, militiamen in various villages are manufacturing landmines and urgently preparing for war. On the 10th of this month, Qinghe concentrated 50 sharpshooters for training. Most of them were guerrilla fighters in the War of Resistance Against Japan. After this training, their skills have improved. In the practice shooting, eight or nine out of ten were able to hit the target. At the end of the training, they were all full of courage. They said: "Whenever Chiang Kai-shek comes, we must be notified quickly, let him see if our bullets are accurate. We will resolutely eliminate them, protect the people, and protect ourselves." After the liberation struggle, the militia of Baizhi Temple farmers in Jize has developed from 30 people to ××× people, organized into × squads. They are active day and night at the junction with Yongnian, attacking the offensive of special agents. In Weixian and Daming, each village has organized a headquarters to uniformly lead the self-defense war. Even near Anyang, militia self-defense teams patrol day and night, and village outposts are densely distributed to prevent the intrusion of special agents.

    【本报威县廿五日电】为粉碎蒋介石的进攻争取全面抵抗的胜利，冀南各地民兵紧张练武，积极准备开展游击战争。冀南武委总会最近在一月中集训了县区武委会干部七十一人，提高了军事技术，并坚定了渡过最艰苦的阶段翻过山头的信心。冀南魏县翻身农民已有万余人参加民兵，并武装起来编成了班排中队和支队，排以上干部及爆炸人员大部训练完毕，八区各村民兵已经开始练武。大名市为适应战争，已经改组机构，定出战时任务与纪律，召集了三百余积极分子，进行备战动员，准备进行自卫战争。成磁召集了七十多个民兵班排干部进行训练，大家热烈的学习了游击战、地雷战，在讨论时事后都作了如下的宣誓：“我是为保卫穷人保卫自己翻身的武装，我知道蒋介石和封建地主是毒辣无耻的心肠，我誓死不投降、不交枪、不妥协，坚决与蒋介石、封建地主……特务干到底”！现在各村民兵都正在制造地雷，紧急备战。清河于本月十日集中五十名神枪手进行训练，他们大都是抗日战争中的游击战士，经过这次训练，提高了技术，在实习打靶时，十之八九能够命中。在训练结束时都是勇气百倍，他们说：“什么时候蒋介石过来，要赶快通知我们，叫他看看我们的子弹准不准，我们坚决消灭他们，保卫老百姓、保卫咱们自己。”鸡泽柏枝寺农民经过翻身斗争，民兵由三十人发展到×××人，编为×班，他们在与永年交界处，日夜活动，打击特务的进攻。魏县、大名每个村庄都组织了指挥部，统一领导自卫战争，直至安阳附近，民兵自卫队日夜巡逻，村村岗哨密布，防止特务的侵入。
