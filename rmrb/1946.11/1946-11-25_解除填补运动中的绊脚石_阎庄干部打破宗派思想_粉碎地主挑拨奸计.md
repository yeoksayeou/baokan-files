　　Removing Obstacles in the Land Leveling Movement
    Yan Village Cadres Break Down Sectarianism
    Crush Landlord's Sabotage Plot
    [Reported by our newspaper from Weixian on the 20th] Yan Village in the Sixth District of Yuanchao, cadres overcame sectarianism and crushed the landlord's sabotage plot. Yan Village has about two hundred households. When mobilizing the masses last year, due to the village cadres' monopolization, the broad masses were not organized; in particular, the village cadres had serious sectarianism, dividing the masses into "insiders" "in the organization" and "outsiders" "not in the organization," and dealt with problems unfairly. The feudal landlord Jia Hongfan took the opportunity to instigate, controlled a part of the masses, and opposed the village cadres. In six months, all organizations almost collapsed. The village cadres were discouraged, and the work was stagnant. In this leveling movement, under the clear slogan of "Farmers all over the world are one family," first, with three activists such as Hu Sangui as the backbone, more than 30 poor peasants were deeply educated, the landlord's sabotage plot was exposed, and the backbone of the village peasant association was established. They also conducted individual and collective talks with the middle peasants, reviewing the past mistakes in the leadership's failure to treat the middle peasants as their own family, which moved everyone to say: "We have no hatred or grievances, we are all one family, and we should not be disunited." Then, they seized on the losses suffered by the poor due to the feudal landlords' instigation of sectarianism and carried out class education to enlighten the masses and concentrate their hatred on the landlords. After the masses were awakened, they all said: "We were deceived by bad people, and we should be of one mind in the future, overthrow the local bullies and turn ourselves over." Then, they organized the awakened masses to publicize, deliberate, and connect in separate groups to develop organizations. Finally, a mass meeting was held, calling on "middle and poor peasants to unite and turn themselves over." In less than three days, one hundred and sixty farm members and one hundred and fifty women members (originally twenty-five) were developed. Taking advantage of the heat, they gathered to explain the land reform policy to the members, analyze the various classes, and clarify that the enemy of the masses was the feudal landlord, and then launched a liquidation struggle against the lawless landlord Jia Hongfan.

　　解除填补运动中的绊脚石
    阎庄干部打破宗派思想
    粉碎地主挑拨奸计
    【本报威县廿日电】元朝六区阎庄村干部克服宗派思想，粉碎了地主挑拨破坏阴谋。阎庄约二百户人家。去年发动群众时，由于村干包办，未把广大群众组织起来；特别是村干存在着严重的宗派思想，把群众分做“圈里人”“在组织”与“圈外人”“不在组织”，处理问题时不公正。封建地主贾洪范即乘机挑拨，掌握了一部分群众，与村干对立。六个月中，各组织几乎垮台。村干丧气，工作停顿。这次填平补齐运动中，在明确的“天下农民是一家”的口号下，首先以胡三贵等三个积极分子为骨干，深入教育了三十多个贫农，揭破地主挑拨阴谋，树立起村农会的骨干。并对中农进行个别谈心和集体谈心，检讨了过去领导上没把中农看成自家人的错误，感动的大家都说：“咱们没仇没冤，都是一家人，不应当不团结”。然后抓紧封建地主挑拨闹宗派使穷人所受的损失，进行阶级教育，启发群众，把仇恨集中到地主身上。群众觉悟后，都说：“咱们上了坏人的当，今后应当一条心，打倒恶霸闹翻身。”接着就组织觉悟了的群众分头宣传、酝酿串连，发展组织。最后召开群众大会，号召“中贫农团结闹翻身”。不到三天，发展农会员一百六十人，妇女会员一百五十人（原二十五人）。趁热集会，给会员讲解土地改革政策，分析各阶层，明确群众的仇人是封建地主，随即对不法地主贾洪范展开了清算斗争。
