    The CCP Central Committee Convenes Mobilization Meeting of Cadres to Defend Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and Yan'an
    Commander-in-Chief Zhu Encourages Everyone: Heroic and Hard Struggle Guarantees Victory!
    Deputy Commander-in-Chief Peng Calls for Preparing All Forces to Thoroughly Crush Chiang Kai-shek's Offensive!
    Comrade Liu Shaoqi Points Out That We Must Change the Party's Organizational and Lifestyle, Strictly Obey Orders and Abide by Discipline!
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th] Yesterday afternoon at 5 pm, the CCP Central Committee convened a mobilization meeting of cadres to defend the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and Yan'an. Over a thousand cadres from all sectors attended. Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Peng, Liu Shaoqi, and Yang Shangkun spoke successively. Deputy Commander-in-Chief Peng reported on the current military situation around the border region, saying, "After ten years of peace in the border region, Chiang Kai-shek has tried to attack Yan'an several times but has not been able to achieve it. But this time, he is determined to attack. The Kuomintang is spreading rumors that we are attacking Yulin as an excuse to attack Yan'an. Although the Yan'an Headquarters has solemnly refuted this and stated that as long as others do not attack us, we will never attack others, Chiang Kai-shek is still actively transferring troops from the east, south, and west, and they are gathering on the border of the border region. The situation is extremely tense. His so-called 'ceasefire order' is just a smokescreen for this large-scale offensive." Deputy Commander-in-Chief Peng called on the military and civilians of the entire border region to prepare all forces to thoroughly crush Chiang Kai-shek's offensive. The main forces must be determined to annihilate all or most of the attacking Chiang troops, and the guerrillas and self-defense forces must launch widespread guerrilla warfare and mine warfare to trap and starve the enemies who invade the border region, learning from the slogan proposed by the people of Wuxiang, southeastern Shanxi: "Take one grain from me, return one drop of blood." He called on all cadres to prepare for a more arduous and tense soldier's life, to prepare for many people living in one cave dwelling, to prepare to use their thighs as desks, and to prepare to obey orders unconditionally at any time and place, and to strive for victory with all their heart and strength. Commander-in-Chief Zhu encouraged everyone in his speech with heroic struggle and hard struggle, saying, "Heroic struggle means not being afraid of death and sacrifice; hard struggle means not being afraid of hardship and not seeking personal enjoyment. This is our greatest guarantee of victory and something that the reactionaries can never achieve." Commander-in-Chief Zhu called on all 300,000 able-bodied men and 300,000 able-bodied women in the entire border region to urgently mobilize, participate in the war, and everyone learn the two simplest tactics of laying mines and throwing grenades, to realize the principle of "everyone a soldier" to defend the border region. Liu Shaoqi pointed out in his speech: It is necessary to change the Party's organizational and lifestyle according to the needs of the war. During the war, the organizational method must first strictly obey orders and strictly abide by discipline. It is not allowed to use the excuse of "solving problems ideologically" to discuss everything, or even repeatedly discuss them. The lifestyle must emphasize hard struggle. The Chinese Communist Party has experienced many extremely difficult periods in its history. Comparing the present with the past, it is nothing. He emphasized even more: "After seven or eight years of recuperation, plus the massive assistance of American imperialism, Chiang Kai-shek's offensive has only shown signs of exhaustion after only four months. This attack on Yan'an can be said to have reached its peak. As long as we persist in hard struggle, his offensive will definitely be repelled in another two to four months. We must persevere, and we are fully capable of persevering, so we will surely win." Subsequently, Yang Shangkun notified everyone of the specific measures for war preparations and lowering the living standards of cadres, starting with the central leaders, before the meeting adjourned.

    中共中央召开保卫陕甘宁延安干部动员会
    朱总司令勉励大家：英勇艰苦奋斗保证胜利！
    彭副总司令号召准备一切力量，彻底粉碎蒋介石进攻！
    刘少奇同志指出必须改变全党组织和生活方式，严格服从命令遵守纪律！
    【新华社延安十二日电】昨日下午五时，中共中央召集了保卫陕甘宁边区与延安的干部动员会，到各方面干部千余人，由朱总司令、彭副总司令、刘少奇、杨尚昆四人先后讲话。彭副总司令报告目前边区周围的军事形势说：“边区经过了十年的和平，蒋介石几次要进攻延安，都没有能实现，但这一次他是一定要进攻的了。国民党造谣说我们进攻榆林，作为打延安的借口，虽经延安总部郑重辟谣，并声明只要别人不进攻我们，我们决不进攻别人，但是蒋介石还是继续从东面南面西面积极调兵遣将，现正纷纷向边区边境集结，形势极端紧张。他所宣布的所谓“停战令”，不过是这个大进攻的烟幕而已。彭副总司令号召全边区军民，必须准备一切力量，彻底粉碎蒋介石的进攻，主力部队要决心歼灭进攻蒋军的全部或大部，游击队自卫军要展开普遍的游击战，地雷战，困死和饿死打进边区的敌人，学习晋东南武乡人民提出的口号：“抢我一颗粮，还我一滴血”。号召全体干部准备过更艰苦更紧张的战士生活，准备多少人住一间窑，准备拿大腿做办公桌，准备随时随地无条件地服从命令，用全心全力争取胜利。朱总司令在讲话中以英勇奋斗和艰苦奋斗勉励大家说：“英勇奋斗就是不怕死，不怕牺牲；艰苦奋斗就是不怕吃苦，不求个人的享受。这是我们胜利的最大保证，是反动派永远做不到的”。朱总司令号召全边区三十万壮年男子和三十万壮年妇女都紧急动员起来，参加战争，人人学会最简单的埋地雷，打手榴弹两项战术，实现全民皆兵，来保卫边区。刘少奇讲话指出：必须按战争的需要改变全党的组织方式和生活方式。在战争期间，组织方式要首先严格服从命令，严格遵守纪律，不允许借口“从思想上解决问题”，对什么问题都要讨论，甚至反复的讨论。生活方式要强调艰苦奋斗。中国共产党在历史上经历过很多极艰苦的时期，拿现在和过去时期比较起来，简直不算什么。他更着重说：“蒋介石经过七八年的养精蓄锐，加上美帝国主义的大量援助，他的攻势却仅仅四个月就已经显出处于衰竭的征象。这次进攻延安，可说是已经达到了它的顶点。只要我们坚持艰苦奋斗，再有两个月到四个月，他的攻势就一定可以被打退。我们是必须坚持，和完全能坚持的，因此我们一定会胜利”。旋由杨尚昆通知关于备战和从中央负责人起降低干部生活水平的具体办法后散会。
