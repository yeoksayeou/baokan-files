　　To Thoroughly Implement "Land to the Tiller"
    Taihang and Southern Hebei Intensify Efforts to Level and Equalize Land Distribution; Vast Numbers of Peasants Obtain Land Through Meticulous Allocation
    [Our Dispatch] After achieving initial liberation through the vigorous total liquidation struggles against traitorous bullies and landlords in Taihang and Southern Hebei since August and September, peasants in various localities are now conducting a widespread review of their liberation based on the "Land to the Tiller" standard. They are engaging in in-depth struggles to thoroughly eliminate feudal exploitation, launching leveling and equalization movements, and rationally distributing the land of traitorous bullies and landlords. The slogan of the peasants in Wu'an is "Pave Smoothly and Fill Evenly": On the one hand, land is distributed first to peasants with no or little land, giving everyone three to six mu of land, which is called filling evenly; on the other hand, other spoils seized from traitorous bullies and landlords are distributed to the majority of peasants according to three classes and nine grades, so that everyone can buy or exchange farm tools, livestock, and other means of production, daily necessities, etc., which is called paving smoothly. During the distribution, in-depth class unity education was carried out to break the erroneous idea of some village cadres and activists who relied on their merits and refused to distribute more land to the masses, thus enabling the distribution work to proceed smoothly. When distributing land in most areas of Neiqiu, meticulous and appropriate filling was carried out according to the quality of the land, whether it was fertile or barren, irrigated or dry, and near or far, so that everyone obtained four to six mu of land, and the quality was generally uniform. The slogans in Xiuwu and Bo'ai in northern Henan were "Allocate According to Needs" and "Democratic Discussion," and whatever was lacking was distributed as much as possible (including land, houses, livestock, farm tools, etc.). When distributing land, all localities gave special consideration to the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, giving them one mu or even three or four mu more of better land than the average peasant. In the old liberated areas of southern Hebei, such as Jize, Yuanchao, Yongzhi, Gucheng, Ningnan, and Feixiang counties, a thorough review of the peasants' liberation was carried out in September and October under the call of the district party committee. It was found that many traitorous bullies and landlords were still dispersing and preserving a lot of land through false pawnings, false sales, gifts, and debt repayments, secretly carrying out feudal exploitation; some were buying off some village cadres with low awareness, secretly controlling the village regime; or threatening and deceiving peasants with the threat of change, attempting to restore their power. In order to completely defeat the feudal forces and eliminate feudal exploitation, the peasants relaunched the liquidation struggle and the anti-sabotage struggle, vigorously launching a final assault, seizing back the land they deserved, and carrying out leveling and equalization. After the leveling was carried out at the village level, in some villages with large gaps between rich and poor, the peasants have been automatically carrying out land adjustments between villages to help their brothers in neighboring villages; villages with more land have automatically donated part of their land to villages with less land (such as Feixiang, Enxian, etc.). The poor people in Wu'an Chengguan also adjusted the fruits of each street in the form of "mutual gift-giving" so that everyone could obtain the conditions for production and prevent the waste of fruits. In addition, some retired soldiers and poor peasants who had no land to divide in their villages, with the help of the government and the peasant association, moved to villages with more land to settle down (Wu'an) and were allocated the land they needed.

　　为彻底实行耕者有其田
    太行冀南深入填平补齐
    经过细密分配广大农民获得土地
    【本报特讯】太行冀南各地农民，经过八、九月份以来轰轰烈烈的反奸霸地主总清算斗争，获得初步翻身后，现正根据耕者有其田的标准，普遍进行翻身大检查，为彻底消灭封建剥削而深入斗争，展开填平补齐运动，合理分配奸霸地主的土地。武安农民的口号是“铺平填平”：一方面把土地尽先分给没地与地少的农民，使每人都获得了三亩至六亩土地，这叫填平；另方面把奸霸地主退出之其他赃物按三等九级分配给大多数农民，使大家都能买得或换得农具、牲口与其他生产资本、日常用具等，这叫铺平。分配中，曾进行深入的阶级团结教育，打破部分村干部积极分子恃功而骄，不愿多分土地给群众的错误想法，使分配工作得以顺利推进。内邱大部地区分地时，依照土地的优劣水旱与远近，实行了细密适当的填补，使每人都获得四亩至六亩土地，质量也大体均匀。豫北修武、博爱各地的口号是“按需分配”、“民主讨论”，缺什么的尽量分给什么（包括土地、房屋、牲口、农具等）。各地在分地时都特别照顾了烈属与军属，给他们每人分得多于农民一亩以上甚至三、四亩的较好土地。冀南老区鸡泽、元朝、永智、故城、宁南、肥乡等县，九、十月份均在区党委号召下深入进行农民翻身大检查。发现仍有不少奸霸地主以假当、假卖、赠送、还账等方式分散保存着许多土地，暗中进行封建剥削；有的则收买一些觉悟低的村干部，暗地掌握着村政权；或以变天威胁欺骗农民，企图复辟。农民为彻底打垮封建势力、消灭封建剥削，乃重新展开清算斗争与反破坏斗争，猛力进行最后冲击，夺回应得之土地，进行填平补齐。在以村为单位填平之后，有些贫富悬殊的村庄，农民已在自动进行村与村土地调剂，帮助邻村弟兄；地多的村庄自动赠送一部分土地给地少的村庄（如肥乡、恩县等地）。武安城关贫民也曾以“互相赠礼”方式进行各街果实的调剂，使人人获得生产条件，同时防止了浪费果实现象。另有些荣退军人及在本村无地可分的贫苦农民，经政府与农会帮助，迁移到地多村安家（武安），并分得所需之土地。
