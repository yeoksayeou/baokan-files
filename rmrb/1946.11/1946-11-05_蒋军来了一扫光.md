　　Chiang's Army Comes and Clears Everything Out
    Fang De

    Among the people in the areas occupied by Chiang's army, there's a saying circulating: "Wherever Chiang's army goes, it clears everything out, even more brutally than the Japanese devils' 'Three Alls Policy' in the past." On October 2nd, Chiang's army invaded Zhangfengji, seized those who hadn't escaped and beat them, while cursing, "You northerners, every family has a Communist soldier, none of you are good people, lock them all up!" Only the young women were left to be assigned to the Chiang soldiers for "cooking" and to sleep with them at night. Qian Yuti's sixteen-year-old daughter was dragged to the company headquarters and gang-raped, and eventually taken away. In Wangzhuang, six women were captured and, without exception, gang-raped. One of the girls was locked in a room and subjected to the insatiable lust of an entire squad. A week after our army recovered the area, she was still lying at home, unable to get out of bed. In Zhangfengji, a Chiang army officer's diary was seized, in which he wrote: "The men in the village are mostly housed together. My soldiers secretly enter civilian houses at night to 'seduce' civilian women." When the iron hooves of Chiang's army trampled into Caojiazhai in Juye liberated area, an old man was a little slow to evade, and his left arm was broken by a shot. In Zhangfengji, more than twenty people were killed together. The most barbaric thing was that more than five hundred people were killed in a killing field specially set up in Qinggujii, northwest of Chengwu, where heads and dismembered limbs were scattered everywhere. A Chiang army soldier named Liang Jingfang said: "When we get there, the chickens, pigs, and sheep there can't hope to keep a single one. No matter the size or number, they must all be eaten." On the first day the Eleventh Division arrived in Dingtao, they were catching chickens everywhere, each wanting to be the first to grab one, and using hand grenades to blast them when they saw them. An innocent child died in the Chiang soldiers' scramble for chickens. But the Chiang soldiers everywhere shouted "Fair purchase, fair purchase," "Chickens and pigs are officially priced at five hundred yuan per catty," but the Chiang soldiers' transactions were done like this: In Wangzhuang, Juye, two pigs were bought from a villager's family for 20,000 yuan of legal tender in the daytime. In the evening, the same Chiang soldier who bought the pigs came to the villager's house, grabbed the old man who sold the pigs and asked, "Where is your money?" The old man didn't recognize the Chiang soldier and pleaded repeatedly, "Sir, I… I have no money!" The Chiang soldier immediately asked, "Where did the 20,000 yuan I gave you in the daytime go? If you don't hand it over, I'll beat you to death!" The Chiang soldiers' transactions also had another way of doing things: In Guzhuang, Juye, the Ninth Company of the Third Battalion of the 54th Regiment, took two pigs and a horse from a villager's family. The villager paid the Chiang soldiers 80,000 yuan in "taxes" before he was allowed to return the items. Before the pigs and horses returned to the pen, they were taken away by another group of Chiang soldiers as their own. Chiang's army fed horses with the grain they found. They squandered more than a hundred piculs in Zhangfengji in just six days. What they couldn't finish was dumped into the muddy pits. The sorghum, millet, and beans with ears were all burned as firewood for lighting. They also gleefully cursed, "The more the grain in the Communist area is burned, the more beneficial it is to us." The entire family of Liu Qitang in Xiwangzhuang, nine people, had all the grain from their seventeen mu of land burned, not a single grain left. When Chiang's army retreated, they also took his child. On the morning our army recovered the village, this family borrowed two catties of sorghum flour from outside to barely get through noon. ＠jia Tang, a village of more than two hundred households where the headquarters of the 31st Regiment of the 11th Brigade of the 11th Division was stationed, was dug three feet deep by the Chiang's army. All the grain, clothing, firewood and grass were gathered and lit to make smoke so that the Chiang's army could use it for air communication. Before they retreated, they set fire to every house. The west wind blew up smoke and clouds, drifting ten miles away. When the people went back to rescue, the Chiang's army also opened fire to shoot. Until 6:00 p.m., our army braved the fire to attack. Three masses, with tears in their eyes, followed our army back to the village to fight the fire, and said angrily: "Communist soldiers, you quickly chase those conscienceless bastards and kill them all to avenge us."

　　蒋军来了一扫光
    方德
    蒋军占领区的人民中，流行着这样一句话：“蒋军所到的地方一扫光，比过去日本鬼子的‘三光政策’还厉害。”十月二日，蒋军侵占了张凤集，抓住那些没有跑掉的人就打，一面还骂着：“你们北方人，一家一个八路，都不是好老百姓，全都关起来！”只留下年青妇女，分配给蒋军“做饭”，晚上陪蒋军睡觉。钱玉悌家一个十六岁的姑娘，被拉到连部轮奸，最后还给带走了。在王庄抓到六个妇女，无例外地轮奸，其中一个闺女，关在一间房里，被一个班无间歇地发泄兽欲。我军恢复这里一星期后，她还躺在家里下不得床。在张凤集，缴获一个蒋军军官的日记里面写着：“村中男人多集中住宿，我士兵深夜私入民房，‘诱奸’民妇。”当蒋军铁蹄踏进解放区巨野曹家垓的时候，一个老汉回避慢了一点，就被一枪打断左臂，在张凤集，一起打死了二十多个人。最野蛮的是，在城武西北青固集专设的一个杀人屠场上，就杀死了五百多，到处摆的是人头和支解的肢体。一个蒋军士兵梁经访说：“我们到那里，那里的鸡、猪、羊就莫想留下一个。不论大小多少，都要吃光。”十一师到定陶的第一天，到处捕捉鸡子，谁也想先抢到手，见到鸡就用手榴弹去炸。一个无辜的孩子，就死在蒋军抢鸡的争夺战里。可是蒋军到处高叫“公买公买”，“鸡、猪官价五百元一斤”，而蒋军的买卖却是这样做的：在巨野王庄，白天花两万元法币在一家老乡家里买了两只猪，晚间仍然是那个买猪的蒋军，到老乡家里，抓住卖猪的老汉问：“你家钱在那里？”老汉倒认不得这个蒋军，再三哀求说：“老总，我………我没有钱呀！”蒋军立即就问：“白天我给你那两万元到那里去了？不交出来打死你！”蒋军的买卖还有另一种做法：在巨野谷庄，五十四团三营九连，牵了老乡两只猪，一匹马，老乡给蒋军上了八万元的“税”，才准予物归原主。猪马还没有归槽，却又被另一部分蒋军当成自己的东西牵走了。蒋军发现粮食就拿来喂马，在张凤集只驻了六天，就糟塌了百多石。吃不完的还倒进淤泥坑里。带穗的高粱、谷子、豆子都作了照明柴烧个精光。还快意地骂着：“共区的粮食，越烧得光越对我们有利。”西王庄刘齐棠全家九口，十七亩地的粮食烧的一颗不留。蒋军败退的时候，还抓走他的孩子。我军恢复该村的早上，这一家人从外面来借二斤高粱面，才算马虎过到中午。十一师十一旅三十一团团部驻的＠家堂，一座二百多户的村子，被蒋军掘地三尺，把所有粮食、衣物、柴草都集中起来点着，使它发烟以便蒋军作对空联络。他们撤退前，把每间房子都点着，西风卷起烟云，飘到十里之外。人民回去抢救，蒋军还开枪射击，直到午后六时，我军冒火出击，三个群众一面流着泪，跟我军一道回村救火，一面愤激地说：“八路军同志们，你们快些追赶那些没良心的龟孙，把他们杀光，替我们报仇。”
