　　【Our Newspaper, Weixian, 24th Dispatch】The Linzhang Overthrow Team is concentrating all its efforts on leading the masses to overthrow [the old order]. In the 53 villages under the rule of the puppet bandit Guo Qing, an anti-traitor and grievance-airing movement has been launched. Before the Overthrow Team arrived, the Second District trained 120 activists. The Overthrow Team cooperated with them, dividing into ten groups to work in the villages. Seeing that someone was backing them, the masses in each village demanded the struggle against traitors, local bullies, and lawless landlords. The masses in Xiyanggao Village paraded and demonstrated in the streets, demanding a thorough liquidation of traitors and bullies. In Nanyanggao Village, the activists who returned from training led the masses to reorganize the farmers' association, increasing membership from 100 to 200, and developing the women's association to 50 or 60 members. They have now begun to struggle against traitorous bullies and landlords. The more than 30 villages in the southern part of the Second District previously had no working foundation. The masses, who had been cruelly oppressed by traitors and feudal forces, were very excited to see the arrival of the Overthrow Team. They automatically implemented a large-scale armed curfew, suppressed the activities of traitors and secret agents, and defended the overthrow movement. After three days of propaganda by the Overthrow Team, the feudal stronghold of Yanliuzhuang quickly launched the movement, and 70 tenant households have been overthrown. It is estimated that in more than ten days, the anti-traitor and grievance-airing movement will be widespread throughout the district.
　　【Our Newspaper, Weixian, 22nd Dispatch】Guo Qing's plainclothes team launched a fierce attack on Wuchakou, Linzhang, but was bravely repelled by our militia. On the night of November 5th, over two hundred members of the traitor Guo Qing's plainclothes team launched a fierce attack on our Wuchakou Village. When the militia discovered them, the enemy was already close to the militia's station. Militia Captain Comrade Wang Qingyun immediately led the crowd to resist stubbornly. Bare-chested, he held a Type 38 rifle, and shouted as he fought, "I am Wang Qingyun, the militia captain of Wuchakou! If you have the guts, come forward! Listen to your grandpa's rifle!" Before he finished speaking, the enemy's bullets really shot forward, but he did not panic at all. He lay on the ground and calmly fought back. When the village cadres and militia heard the gunfire, they immediately ran to assist. Hearing the gunfire from all sides, the enemy fled south in a panic. The militia of the First District and the county brigade also quickly arrived at the village. The militia were even more confident, saying, "As long as we unite, if the plainclothes team comes again, we will definitely wipe them out."
　　【Our Newspaper, Weixian, 24th Dispatch】Pingyuan is actively carrying out armed struggle to support the mass overthrow movement. The armed work team organized by county cadres has penetrated into areas where puppet bandits are active, fighting the enemy on one hand and leading the masses in overthrow struggles on the other. The anti-traitor and grievance-airing movement has been widely carried out throughout the county. During the movement, it was discovered that the local bullies and landlords had two conspiracies: one was to create fake struggles, and the other was to speculate by offering grain and land, attempting to evade mass liquidation. After discussion by the farmers' association, it was unanimously agreed that the conspiracies of traitorous landlords who create fake struggles should be exposed in a timely manner, turning fake struggles into real ones and carrying out serious liquidation. Those who speculate by offering land should be rejected altogether. In order to suppress the activities of special agents during the movement, militias have been universally organized. The County Armed Committee also issued instructions calling on the militia to actively help the masses overthrow the old order under the leadership of the farmers' association. The militia should serve the overthrow movement well, and pay special attention to not arbitrarily using the excuse of buying guns and bullets to control the fruits of the struggle, forming a special group, separating themselves from the masses, and isolating themselves. Note: Pingyuan is located in the area where the Bohai Sea and southern Hebei meet, and is a place where puppet bandits and stragglers are mixed together, making it difficult to carry out work. In the past, armed struggle was the main focus, but now it is combined with armed struggle to carry out land reform.

　　摧毁伪匪统治武装保卫翻身
    临漳郭清统治区反奸清算大开展
    平原县武工队一面与敌战斗一面领导翻身
    【本报威县二十四日电】临漳翻身队集中全力领导群众翻身，在郭清伪匪统治区的五十三村，已掀起反奸诉苦运动，翻身队未去前二区就集训了一百二十名积极分子，翻身队与他们配合，共分十组下乡工作。各村群众看见有人撑腰，纷纷要求斗争汉奸、恶霸及不法地主。西羊羔村群众在大街游行示威，要求彻底清算奸霸。南羊羔村受训回来的积极分子领导群众整理农会，农会会员由一百名增到二百名，妇女会发展到五六十名，现已向奸霸地主开始进行斗争。二区南部三十余村以前没有工作基础，受汉奸、封建势力残酷压榨的群众见到翻身队到达，感到非常兴奋，自动实行了武装大戒严，镇压汉奸特务活动，保卫翻身运动，封建堡垒阎刘庄经翻身队三天宣传，运动很快的展开，七十户佃户已翻身，估计在十余天后，反奸诉苦运动即会普遍全区。
    【本报威县二十二日电】郭清便衣队猛袭临漳五岔口，被我民兵英勇击退。十一月五日夜汉奸郭清便衣队二百余人，猛袭我五岔口村，民兵发觉时，敌已接近民兵驻地，民兵队长王庆云同志即率众顽强抗击，他光着膀背，拿着三八式盖板枪，一面打着，一面喊：“我是五岔口民兵队长王庆云，你们有种往前冲吧！听听你爷爷的盖板枪吧”！话音未落，敌人的子弹真往前射来，但他一点不慌，伏在地下沉着应战，当该村干部和民兵听到枪声，马上跑步出发援助，敌听四面枪声，狼狈南窜，一区民兵及县大队也很快的赶到该村，民兵信心更高了，都说：“咱们只要联合起来，便衣队再来，一定把他们消灭”。
    【本报威县二十四日电】平原积极开展武装斗争，支援群众翻身运动。县干部组织成的武装工作队已深入伪匪活动地区，一面打击敌人，一面领导群众翻身斗争。全县反奸诉苦运动已普遍开展。运动中发现恶霸地主有两种阴谋活动：一是制造假斗争，一是投机献粮献地，企图逃避群众清算。现经农会讨论，一致认为对制造假斗争的汉奸地主要及时揭破其阴谋，弄假成真，进行认真的清算。对投机献地者，一概拒绝。在运动中为了镇压特务活动，都普遍组织了民兵，县武委会并发出指示：号召民兵要在农会领导下，积极帮助群众翻身。民兵应很好为翻身运动服务，特别要注意不随便借口买枪买子弹，把持斗争果实，形成特殊，脱离群众，使自己孤立起来。按：平原地处渤海冀南交界地区，伪匪顽杂处，工作一向很难开展，过去以武装斗争为主，现已结合武装斗争进行土地改革。
