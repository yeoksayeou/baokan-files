    [This dispatch from our Wei County Office, dated the 12th] In the last forty days, a mass campaign to check and reduce rent has swept through 273 villages in Qi County. More than twenty backward villages have also begun heated struggles. Five small villages with no class enemies have also participated in joint struggles within their districts. Based on the current situation, the County Party Committee has specifically proposed conducting in-depth inspections, calling for raising the movement to a new level, and proposing different content based on different types of villages. First, for villages where the struggle has been thorough and are in the process of distributing the fruits of victory, conduct ideological education on the distribution of the fruits of victory: Emphasize class unity, explain that whether one receives a larger or smaller share, it is all in the interests of our own class, and we should not create disunity because of the distribution of the fruits of victory. We must implement measures to level out disparities and ensure that everyone has land to cultivate and housing to live in. We must give preferential treatment to poor military families. When assessing levels, we must first have group discussions, and then pass a resolution through a general meeting. At the same time, we must develop militia on a large scale and expand mass organizations. Second, for villages that have already undergone preliminary struggles, conduct thorough inspections to identify landlords who have slipped through the net, determine the method of struggle based on their class status and the magnitude of their crimes, and carry out the struggle. But resolutely do not struggle against middle peasants. Third, for villages that are currently engaged in heated struggles, implement reasoning and grievance pouring, tracing roots and settling accounts, and thoroughly defeat the landlords economically and politically. Fourth, mobilize larger and richer villages to distribute a portion of land to nearby smaller and poorer villages, and allow them to participate in joint struggles, rewarding them with a portion of the fruits of struggle, and thoroughly realize "land to the tiller."

    企之无斗争对象小村
    参加大富村联合斗争
    县委号召彻查漏网户
    【本报威县十二日电】最近四十天中，企之县二百七十三个村普遍掀起查减运动。二十多个落后村，也开始热烈斗争。五个无斗争对象的小村，也参加了小区联合斗争。根据目前情况，县委特提出进行深入检查，号召把运动提高一步，并按不同类型村提出不同内容。第一、斗争彻底，正在进行分果实的村庄，要进行分果实的思想教育：强调阶级团结，说明分多分少都是我们本阶级利益，不应因分果实而闹不团结。要实行填平补齐，使人人有地种，有房住。要优待贫苦军属。评定等级时要先经小组讨论，再在大会表决通过。同时要大量发展民兵，扩大群众组织。第二、已经初步斗争过的村庄，要进行彻底检查，找出漏网户，按成份及罪恶大小确定斗争方式，进行斗争。但坚决不斗中农。第三、正在热烈进行斗争的村庄，要贯彻说理诉苦，追根清算，彻底从经济上、政治上把地主打垮。第四、发动较大较富的村庄分配给附近小穷村一部分土地，并使其参加联合斗争，提奖一部分斗争果实，彻底实现耕者有其田。
