　　Expose the Landlord's False Cries of Poverty
    Zhehe Villagers, Sharp-Eyed and Quick-Handed, Subdue Landlord Huo Liujin Through Struggle
    [Our Yangcheng Dispatch] Landlord Huo Liujin of Zhehe Village, Fifth District of Pingyao, after being struggled against and liquidated by the masses, on the one hand, cried poverty everywhere, saying, "I have nothing left," to deceive the masses and delay paying the grain he was supposed to hand over; at the same time, he actively tried to find ways in secret to restore his feudal rule. Some of the farmers in the village were softened by his cries of poverty, thinking that he really had nothing left, so they stopped urging him to pay what he owed. After the middle of last month, Yan's puppet troops in Pingyao city constantly went to the countryside to rob, and rumors in the villages became more and more rampant, which aroused the attention of the village cadres and the masses. They found that Huo Liujin had abandoned the dozen or so mu of land left to him by the farmers' association, refusing to cultivate it; at the same time, he had not yet paid off the grain that was assessed last time; they became suspicious of him and led the militia to check the household registrations. As a result, they found a petition against the village farmers' association and a list of village cadres in Huo Liujin's mother's sleeve, intending to hand them over to Yan's puppet troops. The next night, at a mass meeting of the whole village, the chairman of the farmers' association told everyone about this, and everyone was extremely angry, saying, "Good fellow, now we know what you really are. We gave you face, but who knew you would do such outrageous things." So, they struggled against him again fiercely. Huo Liujin's landlord's vicious face was completely exposed, and he could no longer deceive people. He had no choice but to compensate the masses for their losses, admit his mistakes to the masses, and guarantee that he would never do such things again.

　　揭穿地主假哭穷
    遮胡群众眼明手快斗服霍六斤
    【本报阳城讯】平遥五区遮胡村地主霍六斤，在被群众斗争清算以后，除一面到处哭穷说：“俺啥也没有了”，来欺骗群众，拖延付清该交出的粮食；同时，在暗地里积极想办法，企图恢复其封建统治。村里头一部分农民被他这种哭穷的办法说的心软了，以为他真的没有什么了，于是也就不再去催他还清该交出的东西来。上月中旬以后，平遥城内阎伪军不断下乡抢劫，各村里谣言也一天比一天厉害起来，这才引起村干和群众的注意。他们发现农会给霍六斤留下的十几亩地，他都荒了不种；同时，上次算下他的粮食，始终还没交清；就对他怀疑起来，于是就领着民兵清查户口。结果，在霍六斤母亲的袖口里，查出一张告本村农会的状纸，还有一张村干的名单，企图交给阎伪。第二天晚上，在全村群众大会上，农会主席把这件事向大家一讲，大家都气愤极了，都说：“好家伙，这可认清你是个啥东西了，咱给你留面子，谁知你竟耍干这样伤天害理的事。”于是，又把他狠狠的斗了一次。霍六斤的地主狠毒面目完全暴露了，再也欺骗不了人了，这才无可奈何地赔偿了群众的损失，并向群众认错，保证以后再不干这样的事。
