(Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 7th) During the Lianshui Defense Battle, countless glorious examples emerged of the masses rescuing the sick and wounded. Many stretcher teams went to the front line three times to rescue the wounded. Li Yongfu, a stretcher bearer from a certain district, rescued more than twenty wounded soldiers alone outside the south gate of Lianshui on the evening of July 25th. The district's logistics brigade awarded him 1,000 Central China currency. On the 22nd, stretcher bearers from the Shihou district were eating lunch when they heard gunfire. They dropped their bowls, picked up their stretchers, and ran to the war zone under the circling planes of Chiang Kai-shek's army to rescue more than 30 wounded soldiers. On the way, the wounded soldiers wanted to drink tea. While they were boiling water, Chiang Kai-shek's planes arrived again. Just as they had moved the wounded to a safe place, a bomb landed exactly where they had placed the stretchers. The stretcher team from the Shihou district rescued more than 30 wounded soldiers under the repeated strafing of five Chiang Kai-shek planes. They didn't eat for two days and a night and carried the wounded for more than a hundred li. The district and village cadres also carried stretchers like the civilians, especially Zhao Zhengzhi, a 54-year-old village farmers' association chairman, who, despite having eye problems, carried stretchers all day and night like everyone else. On the evening of the 25th, a stretcher team from a certain district transported the wounded to a rear hospital more than 70 li away. On the way, Chen Youwen, a stretcher bearer, didn't eat anything himself and even paid for bread for the wounded. Li Xiangshuang, a soldier from a certain unit who had been wounded three times, said to the stretcher bearers: "I will never forget you even in death!"

    涟水保卫战中群众踊救伤员
    【新华社华中七日电】涟水保卫战中涌现出无数群众救护伤病员的光荣范例，许多担架队连上三次火线，抢救伤员。某区担架队员李永福，七月二十五晚上一个人在涟水南门外，抢救了二十多个伤员，该区后勤大队奖华中币一千元。二十二日石湖区担架队员正在吃午饭时听到枪声，就丢下饭碗，扛起担架，在蒋机盘旋下跑到战区救出三十多名伤兵。路上伤兵要喝茶，正在烧茶时，蒋机又至，当他们刚把伤兵抬去隐蔽了，炸弹就正落在原来放担架的地方。石湖区的担架队，在五架蒋机轮流扫射下，仍抢救了三十多名伤兵。他们两天一夜不吃饭，还抬着伤兵跑百多里。该区区村干部，也都和民夫一样抬担架，尤其是五十四岁的村农会长赵征志，眼睛有病，这次也和大家一样整天整夜的抬担架。二十五日晚上×区担架队运送伤员至七十多里的后方医院，在途中担架队员陈有文自己不吃东西，还掏钱买面包给伤员吃。×部曾受过三次伤的战士李相双对担架队员说：“我死也忘不了你们”！
