    The Taihang Military Commission Issues Another Call to Action
    Launch a Broad Explosion Campaign
    Use Minefields to Block All Chiang Kai-shek Puppet Strongholds, Combine with Sniper Warfare to Turn Dead Mines into Live Mines
    [This newspaper's Changzhi, 18th dispatch] The Taihang Military Commission, on the 6th, again issued a call to action to the people of the entire region to launch an explosion campaign, pointing out that since May of this year, in the war between the border areas and the Chiang Kai-shek-Yan Xishan puppet troops, thirteen counties in our border areas have widely used landmine explosions, and created an example of killing and wounding 21 enemies in one explosion. Currently, Chiang Kai-shek's puppets are intensifying their offensive against our region. To cooperate with the main force's mobile warfare to eliminate the enemy, we should organize specialized explosion teams to block all Chiang Kai-shek puppet strongholds and the towns they have seized with landmines, and continuously blow up railways and highways to cut off their supplies, making it difficult for the enemy to move an inch. We should also cooperate with the work of clearing the fields and protecting villages, towns, and houses with landmines, and burying supplies. Therefore, explosion training should be universally carried out in this winter's military training in various places. New areas and border areas should select village armed cadres and militiamen for rotational training, and manufacture stone mines in large quantities. As for landmine tactics, they should be combined with sniper warfare to turn dead mines into live mines, find the enemy's activity patterns, and implement flying continuous explosions whenever the enemy comes to bury them, putting the invaders in the embarrassing situation of being surrounded by mines everywhere.

    太行武委会再度发出号召
    广泛开展爆炸运动
    用地雷阵封锁蒋伪所有据点与冷枪战结合变死雷为活雷
    【本报长治十八日电】太行武委会于六日再度向全区人民发出开展爆炸运动的号召，指出今年五月以来，在边地与蒋阎伪军的战争中，我边沿区有十三个县，广泛的使用了地雷爆炸，并创造出一次炸死伤敌二十一名的范例。目前蒋伪正加紧向本区进攻，为配合主力军的运动战消灭敌人，我们应组织专门的爆炸队，做到把一切蒋伪据点及其侵占之城镇全部以地雷封锁起来，并连续爆炸铁路公路断其补给，使敌寸步难行，并配合清室空野工作，家家用地雷保护村镇房屋与埋藏物资。因此，各地今冬练武应普遍进行爆炸训练，新区及边沿地区应抽调村武装干部及民兵轮训，并大批制造石雷。至于地雷战术，应与冷枪战结合，变死雷为活雷，寻找敌人活动规律，实行敌来随埋之飞行连续爆炸，使进犯者陷入遍地是雷的窘态。
