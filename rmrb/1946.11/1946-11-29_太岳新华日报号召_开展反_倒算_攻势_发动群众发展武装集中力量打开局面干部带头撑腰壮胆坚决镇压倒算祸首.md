[This dispatch from our paper in Taiyue, dated the 27th] The counter-reverse settlement offensive launched along the Taiyue-Tongpu line and in northern Henan has gradually unfolded, achieved significant results, and yielded valuable experiences. Today, the Taiyue Xinhua Daily publishes an editorial entitled "Launching a Counter-Reverse Settlement Offensive." The editorial first points out that since the intrusion of Chiang Kai-shek's die-hard troops into our region in early July, some traitors, local bullies, evil gentry, and landlords have established extremely reactionary "Revenge Teams" and "Reverse Settlement Teams" to reverse the accounts with local peasants, overturn their liberation, plunder the fruits of their emancipation, massacre liberated masses and cadres, and undermine the implementation of "Land to the Tiller." Therefore, all counties in temporarily occupied and border areas should universally launch a mass-based counter-reverse settlement offensive to crush the reactionary forces' restoration ambitions and defend the masses' liberation interests.

The editorial then cites the experience of Yuanqu County to explain how to launch a counter-reverse settlement offensive, stating:

First, it is necessary to break through ideological obstacles and concentrate strength. What ideological viewpoints hinder our efforts to launch a counter-reverse settlement offensive? (1) Fear of the KMT and Special Agents – Some comrades have not thoroughly understood the enemy but blindly overestimate them and underestimate ourselves. They fail to see the favorable conditions, the heroic deeds of the masses, and various positive factors. Consequently, they develop a fear of the KMT and special agents, busying themselves with running away, becoming detached from the masses, and in some individual places, even bowing to the landlords and seeking peace. This is not "utilizing legality" or "mitigating class contradictions," but rather a manifestation of right-leaning timidity. (2) Waiting Mentality – Some comrades believe that it is impossible to mobilize the masses in border areas and temporarily occupied areas until the enemy is driven away. Therefore, they think day and night about the main force going to conquer the world, instead of actively uniting the masses, relying on the masses, and launching a mass offensive. This erroneous viewpoint stems from their disbelief in the power of the masses, their failure to study how to adopt appropriate strategies to mobilize the masses under enemy rule, and their lack of understanding that the Eighth Route Army can only win battles when it gains the support of the broad masses. (3) Purely Armed Viewpoint – Some comrades only know to actively lead guerrilla regiments to defeat the enemy, which is commendable. However, they do not pay attention to using every lull in the war to seize the opportunity to mobilize the masses. This kind of purely armed struggle that does not rely on the masses is an armed struggle without roots. It cannot create a fierce and powerful offensive, nor can it develop and accumulate strength, let alone persist for a long time.

Second, cadres take the lead to support and encourage. When the enemy first arrives, the masses do not understand the situation, and it is inevitable that they will panic and run away for a time. But running around, it is not for anything else, but to find cadres to come up with ideas and think of ways. At this time, if the cadres are not firm and detached from the masses, they will not be able to grasp the strength and persist in the struggle. If they can persist in standing with the masses, come up with ideas and think of ways, support and encourage them, the public mood can be stabilized and the struggle can be launched. Zhao, the political instructor of the Second District of Yuanqu, is a good example of uniting the masses, persisting in the struggle, and turning danger into safety at a time of tense situation.

Third, resolutely suppress reverse settlement culprits to break the deadlock. After the enemy came, the reactionary elements were very arrogant. At this time, our policy is to resolutely suppress the reverse settlement culprits and confiscate their property to serve as a warning to others; the small reverse settlement people should be arrested and forced to return the fruits that the farmers have recovered in full, bow their heads to repent, guarantee that they will not mess around again in the future, and guarantee the safety of the property of the Farmers' Association, militia and our cadres' families; after further education, they should be released on bail. With regard to the peaceful objects of struggle, we must unite them and protect the safety of their lives and property. In addition to protecting the safety of their lives and property, we should also give appropriate commendations to the objects of struggle who inform us and are able to protect the masses and the families of our personnel. This policy of suppression and winning over, extinguishing the flames of stubbornness, disintegrating stubbornness, and isolating stubbornness, in order to open up the situation of anti-reverse settlement, create a peasant's advantage in the war, and launch a mass-based and fierce counter-reverse settlement offensive.

Fourth, use armed forces to open up the situation of anti-reverse settlement. On the basis of the mass movement against the reverse settlement, develop armed forces, carry out guerrilla warfare, and further expand the reverse settlement movement. When this struggle began, the comrades in Yuanqu first concentrated the strength of the guerrillas and militia companies, went deep into the rear of the stubborn and into the strongholds, captured and killed the reverse settlement culprits, besieged the stubborn strongholds, attacked and captured the "Revenge Teams," protected the interests of the masses, and improved the confidence of the masses. Under this situation, the anti-reverse settlement movement has been fiercely launched. In the struggle against the reverse settlement, many villagers have automatically organized guard militias, and the guard militias rely on the field militias. This combination of the three in one (militia, guard militia, and field militia) combines all the forces of the party, government, army, and people, and is connected with the masses in all aspects, launching a comprehensive military, political, and economic offensive against Chiang Kai-shek's stubborn forces. This kind of force cannot be defeated or destroyed, and all difficulties can be solved by relying on the masses.

Fifth, the fruits we regain in the struggle against reverse settlement should be returned to the masses, and the objects should be returned to their original owners. They must never be treated as confiscated property of enemies, traitors, or secret agents, nor should they be treated as spoils of war. If we do not return the fruits of the reverse settlement to the peasants, then the peasants will not be active in the struggle, they will wait and see, and they will become detached from us, so we must promote the spirit of serving the peasants.

At the same time, we must never blindly launch a counter-reverse settlement offensive, but must proceed according to the comparison of strength between the enemy and ourselves. In places near enemy-occupied points and lines where the enemy is strong and we are weak, if the situation does not permit a counter-reverse settlement, then we should mainly focus on utilizing "legality" in conjunction with armed struggle to protect the interests of the masses. In the event that the fruits of the masses are taken away under the threat of the enemy, we must also comfort the masses, educate the masses, improve confidence in victory, and strengthen the will to fight, telling them that this is a temporary loss, and once there is an opportunity, they must avenge themselves and take back the fruits. So that the masses are not deceived by the enemy's appeasement policy in their thinking and will, and are not subdued by the policy of tyrannical oppression. After the counter-reverse settlement offensive is universally launched, it should not be stopped, but should be further mobilized on this basis, as far as possible, and strive to realize "Land to the Tiller" in all situations where it is permitted. However, in the struggle, more attention should be paid to the flexibility of tactics, and more methods of reasoning and arbitration should be adopted. In short, we must neither act recklessly without considering objective conditions and without regard to tactics, nor should we be satisfied with the results of the reverse settlement and stop moving forward.

### 太岳新华日报号召  开展反“倒算”攻势  发动群众发展武装集中力量打开局面干部带头撑腰壮胆坚决镇压倒算祸首

　　太岳新华日报号召
    开展反“倒算”攻势
    发动群众发展武装集中力量打开局面干部带头撑腰壮胆坚决镇压倒算祸首
    【本报太岳二十七日电】太岳同蒲沿线及豫北发动的反倒算攻势，已逐渐展开，并且已收到很大效果，创造了很多经验。今日太岳新华日报，特以《开展反倒算攻势》为题，发表社论。社论首先指出，自七月初，蒋顽侵入我区之后，部分汉奸恶霸豪绅地主即成立了极端反动的“复仇队”“倒算队”，向当地农民倒算账，倒翻身，劫夺翻身果实，屠杀翻身群众与干部，破坏耕者有其田的实施；因此，凡是暂时沦陷区及边沿区各县，应即普遍展开群众性的反倒算攻势，粉碎反动势力的复辟野心，保卫群众翻身利益。
    继以垣曲的经验指出怎样开展反倒算攻势称：
    第一，首先要打通思想，集中力量。有那些思想观点障碍我们开展反倒算攻势呢？（一）恐顽怕特情绪——有些同志没有周详的去了解敌人而又是盲目的过高估计了敌人，过低的估计了自己，他们看不见有利条件与群众中的英勇事绩，以及各种积极因素，因而便产生了恐顽怕特的情绪，忙于奔跑，脱离群众，甚至还有个别地方竟有向地主低头求和者。这不是什么“利用合法”“缓和阶级矛盾”，恰恰是右倾怯懦情绪在作怪。（二）等待观点——有些同志认为敌人不打走，便无法在边沿区与暂时沦陷区发动群众，因之他们日夜想念主力军去打天下，而不去积极团结群众，依靠群众，发动群众攻势。这一错误观点的产生，是由于他们不相信群众有力量，不研究在敌人统治下如何采取恰当的策略去发动群众，不了解八路军只有当获得广大群众支持时才能打胜仗的道理。（三）单纯武装观点——有的同志只知积极领导游击兵团去打垮敌人，这是值得表扬的。但却不注意利用一切战争空隙争取发动群众，这种不依靠群众的单纯武装斗争是没有根的武装斗争。这不但不能造成凶猛有力的攻势，而且也无法发展力量，积蓄力量，更不可能持久的坚持下去。
    第二，干部带头，撑腰壮胆。敌人初来，群众不了解情况，自不免一时惊慌乱跑。但跑来跑去，不是为着其他，而是要找干部出主意想办法。此时干部如不坚定，脱离群众，便无法掌握力量，坚持斗争。如能坚持与群众站在一起，出主意想办法，撑腰壮胆，群情即可稳定，斗争即可开展。垣曲二区赵教导员是在时局紧张关头，团结群众，坚持斗争，转危为安的好榜样。
    第三，坚决镇压倒算祸首，打开反倒算的局面。敌人来后，反动分子气焰很高，在这时，我们的政策是对倒算祸首要坚决镇压，并没收其财产，以警效尤；对小倒算者要逮捕起来，强制具如数退还农民的果实，低头悔过，保证以后再不胡干，保证农会民兵及我干部家属财产的安全；再加以教育后，讨保释放。对安分守己的斗争对象，要加以团结，并保护其生命财产的安全。对向我通风报信并能保护群众及我方人员家属之斗争对象，除保护其生命财产之安全外，并应给以适当表扬。以此镇压与争取配合的政策，摧顽之焰，分化顽固，孤立顽固，以打开反倒算的局面，造成农民在战争中的优势，开展群众性的勇猛的反倒算攻势。
    第四，用武装力量打开反倒算局面。在反倒算的群众运动基础上发展武装力量，开展游击战争，进一步扩大反倒算运动。垣曲同志当这一斗争开始，即首先集中了游击队与民兵连的力量，深入顽后及据点内，捕杀了倒算祸首，围困顽据点，打击捕捉“复仇队”，保卫了群众利益，提高了群众信心，反倒算运动便在这个情况之下，猛烈的开展起来了。在反倒算的斗争中，不少村庄群众，又自动组织了警卫民兵，警卫民兵依靠着野战民兵，这种三位一体（民兵、警卫民兵、野战民兵）的结合着党政军民全部力量，从各方面与群众发生着联系，向蒋顽展开军事的政治的经济的综合性的攻势，这种力量是打不垮打不烂的，一切困难都能依靠群众得到解决。
    第五，在反倒算斗争中，我夺回的果实应一律归群众，应物归原主，绝不能当作没收敌人汉奸特务的财产去处理，亦不能当成战利品去处理，如果不把反倒算夺回的果实重还农民，那么农民就会斗争不积极，就会观望，就会脱离我们，所以必须发扬为农民服务的精神。
    同时，也绝不是盲目的去开展反倒算攻势，而是要根据敌我力量的对比去进行，在敌强我弱的敌占点线上及其附近地方，如情况不许可反倒算时，那就主要以利用“合法”为主，配合以武装斗争，以保卫群众利益。万一在敌人威胁下群众果实被夺时，也要安慰群众，教育群众，提高胜利信心，坚定斗争意志，告诉他们这是暂时的损失，一旦有机会便要报仇雪恨，重新收回。使群众在思想上意志上不为敌人的怀柔政策所欺骗，横暴压迫政策所屈服。当反倒算攻势普遍开展之后，绝不应止此了事，而应在此基础上进一步发动群众，尽可能争取在一切情况许可的地方，实现耕者有其田。但在斗争上应更多注意策略的灵活性，要多采用说理仲裁的斗争方式。总之，既不可不顾客观条件，不讲策略的去蛮干，也不可只满足于反倒算成绩而中止不前。
