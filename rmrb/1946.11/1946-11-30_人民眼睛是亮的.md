The *Millard's Review* published many reader letters on October 12th, reflecting the righteous indignation of the people in the Chiang-occupied areas. Now, I excerpt a few paragraphs below.

The "National Assembly" That Cannot Represent Any People

The so-called "National Assembly" convened on November 12th (Note: It has already convened on the 15th), supposedly includes nine hundred and fifty old representatives (Original note: God knows who "elected" them), and eight hundred and fifty new representatives whose identities are still unknown. Such a "National Assembly" is clearly a disguise of the Kuomintang, a trick used by the Kuomintang to deceive other parties and the people. I can assert that the people of the whole country will definitely think that such a "National Assembly" cannot represent us. (A Chinese person from Shanghai, October 5th)

A Historical Analogy

The history of three hundred years ago is perfectly analogous to today. At the end of the Ming Dynasty, the court was unprecedentedly corrupt and incompetent, the people suffered, and popular uprisings arose. Zhang Xianzhong and Li Zicheng have always been well-known commoner heroes among the people.

On the other hand, Wu Sangui, representing the ruling class, was frightened by the power of the peasant uprising and invited the Manchus to quell the "rebellion." The "rebellion" was quelled, and the Manchu army did not withdraw, resulting in the guest becoming the master. That's how China was conquered by a foreign race.

From a historical point of view, the current situation in China is not much different from that of three hundred years ago. The question is whether this historical replay is only on one aspect, or on many aspects? (Ms. Ye from Shanghai, October 6th)

War Expenditure

Recently, the government has broken through the practice of not paying taxes to the legal government for imported goods and has imposed additional tariffs. The customs office had no choice but to comply.

In order to pay for war expenditure, we specifically suggest that the government restore the collection of all national and local taxes during the Japanese occupation. The reason can be stated as follows: "The government hasn't spent a penny on that tax resistance!" (Zheng Baoming from Qingdao, October 2nd)

　　人民眼睛是亮的
    十月十二日《密勒氏评论报》上发表了许多读者通讯，反映了蒋占区人民的义愤，现在摘译几段下在面。
  不能代表任何人民的“国大”
    十一月十二日召开的所谓“国民大会”（按：已在十五日召开），据说其中有九百五十个旧代表（原注：天晓得他们是谁“选举”的），还有八百五十个新代表现在还不知道是谁。这样的“国大”明明是国民党的伪装，是国民党用来欺骗其他党派与人民的把戏。我可断言全国人民一定认为这样“国大”是不能代表我们的。（十月五日一个中国人寄自上海）
    历史的类比
    三百年前的历史与今天适成类比。明末，朝廷空前腐败无能，人民痛苦，民变蜂起，张献忠李自成在人民中间一直是闻名的布衣英雄。
    另一方面，代表统治阶级的吴三桂，被农民起义的声威吓倒了，便邀请满人来平“乱”。“乱”平了，满军也不撤退了，结果反宾为主。中国就是那么被外族征服的。
    从历史的观点看来，中国现况与三百年前无大差别，问题要看这段历史的重演是仅仅在一方面呢，还是多方面呢？（十月六日叶女士寄自上海）
    内战经费
    最近政府突破货物入口未向合法政府纳税，特加征关税，海关只好从命。
    为了支付内战经费，我们特建议政府恢复征收日本统治时期一切国家地方税。理由可以这样讲：“那种抗税收做法政府尚未曾动用分文呢”！（十月二日郑宝明寄自青岛）
