Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd: Narcotics are rampant in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. According to various sources, major drug trafficking cases have been continuously discovered in various places recently, and those in charge are mostly powerful figures in the Kuomintang government. On October 24th, Tianjin cracked a large-scale drug trafficking case involving current civil servants, seizing more than 40 catties of opium and more than 20 million yuan in drug money. One of the principal criminals was Du Jiaochi, the current secretary of the Tianjin government and commissioner of the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau, and clerk Luo Xing. The trafficking organization was connected to trafficking organizations in Beiping and Shanghai. According to the Central News Agency, it is estimated that there are more than 30,000 drug traffickers in Tianjin alone, and drugs are pervasive throughout the city. In Shangqiu, Henan, several major cases of "armed drug transportation" and "armed drug trafficking" have also been discovered. Under the auspices of the authorities, a "drug prohibition publicity team" of all sectors was routinely organized. Some children from the county's girls' middle school and the county teachers' school participated, but unexpectedly, a tragedy occurred. Yang Shuxun, who had served as the deputy director of the Third Route Army and is now the captain of the guard, is a drug offender. When the inspection team passed his door, he was angered and ordered more than 20 armed guards to chase and shoot, seriously injuring a female student and a merchant. Yang's men left triumphantly, and the county government was helpless. Drug trafficking in Taiyuan is even more widespread. Most of the heroin comes from the Pingjin-Shijiazhuang area, and each piece (two taels) sells for 500,000 yuan wholesale and 800,000 yuan retail. Everyone believes that the profit is very high, and they flock to it like crazy. According to another report from Taiyuan, personnel from the Kuomintang Aviation Command in Taiyuan use air transport to traffic drugs from Taiyuan to Xi'an, making three times the profit. In Linfen, they also get twice the profit. In Shenyang, 120 drug trafficking cases were cracked in September, involving more than 100 drug offenders, one-third of whom were military personnel. The Kuomintang Ministry of Interior has recently openly sold opium to make up for its insufficient expenses. According to the Shanghai United Evening News on October 12, the Ministry of Interior has sent several so-called "special commissioners for investigating opium" to the Shanghai Municipal Government warehouse to receive and sell 146 large boxes of opium.
