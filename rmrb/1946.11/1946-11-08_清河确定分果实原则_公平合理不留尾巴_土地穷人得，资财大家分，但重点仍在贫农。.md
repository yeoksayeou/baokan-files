　　Qinghe Determines Principles for Distributing the Fruits of Victory
    Fair and Reasonable, Leaving No Loose Ends
    Land to the Poor, Assets Shared by All, but with Emphasis Still on Poor Peasants.
    [Report from our Weixian Office, 3rd] Seventeen thousand peasants in Qinghe are carrying out a campaign to fill gaps and level differences. From the county to the village level, there is a determination to ensure that the distribution of the fruits of victory is fair and reasonable, leaving no loose ends: land to the poor, assets shared by all—with the emphasis still on poor peasants, because after they obtain land, they lack everything: plowing oxen, tools, seeds, fertilizer, clothing, food, housing—everything needs to be acquired. The Second District conducted specific experiments on the distribution of the fruits of victory, and determined the following ratios: a desperately poor person is equivalent to forty people, a poor peasant is equivalent to ten people, a poor middle peasant is equivalent to four people, a middle peasant is equivalent to two people, and a well-off middle peasant is equivalent to one person. Initially, everyone felt that the disparity was too great and would affect unity with the middle peasants. According to experiments, such as in Liu Bao Village, with ten desperately poor households, according to the above ratio, the desperately poor only receive 12 percent of the total fruits of victory, poor peasants receive 19 percent, and middle and well-off middle peasants receive 69 percent due to their larger number of households. In addition, the Third District has stipulated methods for distributing the fruits of victory to military dependents: for the families of martyrs, disabled soldiers, and old military dependents, each person receives one share, equivalent to three people; for old worker dependents and new military dependents, each person is equivalent to two and a half people; for local soldiers, each person is equivalent to two people; and for new worker dependents, each person is equivalent to one and a half people. In the Second District, each military dependent's share is one to four times greater than that of ordinary people. Whether the above methods are correct remains to be verified by facts.

　　清河确定分果实原则
    公平合理不留尾巴
    土地穷人得，资财大家分，但重点仍在贫农。
    【本报威县三日电】清河十七万农民开展填平补齐运动。从县到村，对于分配果实问题，都决心作到公平合理，不拉尾巴，土地穷人得，资财大伙分，——重点也还在贫农，因为他们得到土地后，耕牛、工具、种子、肥料、吃穿，住房一切都缺乏，都需要置备。二区对于分果实作了具体实验，确定了比例，赤贫一人顶四十人，贫农一人顶十人，贫苦中农一人顶四人，中农一人顶二人，富裕中农一人顶一人。开始大家觉得悬殊太大，影响团结中农，根据试验，如刘保庄，以十户赤贫计，按上述比例分配，赤贫只分得全部果实的百分之十二，贫农分得百分之十九，中农富中农因户数多得百分之六十九。另外，三区规定了军属分果实的办法：烈属，荣军老军属其本人一分，一人顶三人，老工属，新军属，其本人一人顶二个半人，地方军其本人一人顶两人，新工属其本人一人顶一个半人。二区分果实是军属全家每人比普通群众加一倍至四分之一倍。上述办法，尚待事实检证其正确与否。
