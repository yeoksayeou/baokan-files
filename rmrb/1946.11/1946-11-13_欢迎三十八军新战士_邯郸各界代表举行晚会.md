    Welcoming New Soldiers of the 38th Army
    Representatives from All Circles in Handan Hold Evening Party

    [Report from this newspaper, Handan] (Delayed) At 6:00 PM on October 29th, representatives from all circles in Handan City held an evening party at the Handan Theater to welcome the new soldiers of the 38th Army. Over 1,500 new soldiers attended. First, Vice Director Feng of the City National Salvation Association briefly explained the significance of the evening party. He emphasized: "The vast majority of these new soldiers are farmers who have stood up, voluntarily joining the army to defend their homes and the fruits of their victorious struggle. There are also some soldiers from the 117th Brigade who revolted in Hui County. This proves that the strength of traitor Chiang Kai-shek is collapsing day by day, while the people's army and the people's strength are growing stronger and stronger. This is a welcome event." Next, Mayor Wang delivered a welcoming speech, saying: Although our people's army comes from two different regions, our goal is the same: to defeat Chiang Kai-shek's offensive. Therefore, everyone should strengthen unity, step up learning, improve combat skills, and complete their glorious tasks. Then, representatives from all circles delivered welcoming speeches, unanimously pointing out: The people of all circles in Handan City are willing to unite closely with the people's army and do everything possible to strive for the victory of the patriotic self-defense war. Army Commander Kong Congzhou delivered a reply, saying: "Our people's army must serve the people wholeheartedly, be the people's public servant, cherish the interests of the people everywhere, and integrate with the people. In the future, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we will resolutely fight to the end for the people's revolutionary cause." Finally, a new soldier said: "This time we all volunteered to join the army. Everyone must unite to completely defeat old Chiang, so that we can thoroughly stand up." In the end, the Fuyang Theater performed "Hua Mulan Joins the Army," and the Mass Art Research Society sang "The Eighth Route Army Liberates Xingtai" to add to the excitement.

    欢迎三十八军新战士
    邯郸各界代表举行晚会
    【本报邯郸讯】（迟到）十月廿九日下午六时，邯市各界人士代表在邯郸剧院召开晚会，欢迎三十八军的新战士，到会新战士有千五百余人。首先由市救国会冯副主任简要的说明这个晚会的意义，他着重指出：“我们这些新战士，除了绝大部分是翻了身的农民，为了保卫家乡，为了保卫胜利的斗争果实，而自动的参军外，还有部分是在辉县起义的一一七旅的战士们，这可以证明卖国贼蒋介石的力量是日趋于崩溃，而人民的军队和人民的力量是一天天在壮大生长起来，这是值得欢迎的大事。”次由王市长致欢迎词，他说：我们这支人民的军队，虽然来自两个不同地区，但大家的目的却只有一个就是要打败蒋介石进攻。因此大家加强团结，加紧学习，提高作战的技术，完成自己的光荣的任务。接着各界代表致欢迎词，他们一致指出：邯市各界人民愿和人民的军队亲密团结起来，竭尽一切力量，为争取爱国自卫战争的胜利而共同奋斗。孔从周军长致答词说：“我们这支人民的军队，一定要全心全意的为人民服务，做人民的公仆，要处处爱护人民的利益，和人民打成一片，今后我们在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，坚决地为人民革命事业奋斗到底。”末了一位新战士讲话说：“这回我们都是自愿参军的，大家要一致团结起来，把老蒋打完蛋了，咱们才能彻底的翻身。”最后由滏阳剧团出演“花木兰从军”，大众艺术研究社唱“八路军解放邢台”助兴。        （刘伯欧）
