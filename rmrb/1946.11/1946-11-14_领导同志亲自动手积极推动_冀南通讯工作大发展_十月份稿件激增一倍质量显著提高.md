Jinnan Communications Work Experiences Great Development
October Submissions Double, Quality Improves Significantly

[Our newspaper, Weixian, 8th dispatch] Under the personal writing and active promotion of leading comrades in various regions, the Jinnan Daily's communications work has made significant progress. Amidst the large-scale mass movement and enlistment movement, communications work in various regions has developed by leaps and bounds. In terms of quantity, manuscripts have surged from 506 in August to 1,370 in October. This is an unprecedented phenomenon in the communications work of this region, improving the quality of the newspaper and enhancing its guiding role in practical work. This is mainly due to the leading comrades in various regions personally writing manuscripts and earnestly leading the communications work. Comrade Qiao Xiaoguang, Secretary of the Fourth District Committee, actively promoted cadres to write manuscripts when inspecting work in Guangzong, Pingxiang, and Weixian counties. After returning to the office, he personally wrote letters to various counties, instructing them to intensify their communications work, and he himself began to write his first piece, "The Enlistment Tide in Pingxiang and Guangzong." Comrade Han Ningfu, Minister of Propaganda of the First District Committee, not only actively led and assisted Yongzhi in developing communications work but also personally wrote "How Yongzhi Opened Up the Anti-Traitor Situation" and "Several Experiences in Yongzhi's Anti-Traitor Work," both of which are valuable articles. Comrade Wu Gang, Minister of Organization of the Second District Committee, wrote "Experience in Mobilizing the Masses," which was not only published in the People's Daily but also broadcast nationwide by the Yan'an Xinhua News Agency. Others, such as Liang Yimin, Minister of Civil Affairs of the Third District Committee, Duan Yi, Minister of Organization of the Fifth District Committee, Wang Hao, Minister of Propaganda, and the twenty-eight county committees and eighteen county committee secretaries, all personally wrote manuscripts for the newspaper. In government departments, about twenty county magistrates and secretaries also personally took action. In the military system, Comrade Bai Yun, Commander of the First Military Sub-district, personally took charge of reporting on the dynamics of the puppet-reactionary forces in the Liaocheng area. The exemplary promotion by responsible comrades in various regions has greatly advanced the communications work. For example, under the leadership of County Secretary Zhao Zhenqing in Yongzhi, manuscript submissions increased from six in June to forty-eight in September and fifty-five in October. Under the leadership of County Secretary Cao Yukun in Feixiang, submissions increased from seven in August to eighty-four in October. Under the leadership of County Secretary Feng Ji and County Magistrate Cui Shaowu in Ningnan, submissions increased from three or four per month to twenty-seven. Ji County only submitted seventeen manuscripts in August, but this also increased to thirty-three in October.

    领导同志亲自动手积极推动
    冀南通讯工作大发展
    十月份稿件激增一倍质量显著提高
    【本报威县八日电】在各地领导同志亲自写稿与积极推动下，冀南日报通讯工作获显著进步。在大规模的群运与参军运动中，各地通讯工作更飞跃开展起来。数量上，由八月份的五百零六件稿激增至十月份的一千三百七十件。这是本区通讯工作空前未有的现象，提高了报纸的质量，增强了对实际工作的指导作用。这主要是各地领导同志亲自动手写稿与认真领导通讯工作的结果。四地委书记乔晓光同志到广宗、平乡、威县等地巡视工作时，积极推动干部写稿，回到机关后，又亲自给各县写信，指示各县加紧开展通讯工作，自己也开始动手写出第一篇《平乡、广宗参军潮》。一地委宣传部长韩宁夫同志，不但积极领导与帮助永智开展通讯工作，而自己亲自写的《永智如何打开反奸局面》与《永智反奸中的几点经验》，都是很有价值的文章。二地委组织部长吴罡同志写的《运群运经验》，不但人民日报登载，延安新华总社还向全国广播了。其他如三地委民运部长梁一民、五地委组织部长段毅、宣传部长王浩及二十八个县委，十八个县委书记，都亲自动手给报纸写了稿。在政府部门，也有二十来个县长、秘书亲自动手。军队系统中，一分区司令员白芸同志，亲自负责报导聊城方面伪顽动态。各地负责同志以身作则的推动，使通讯工作大大前进了一步。如永智在县书赵振清同志领导下，由六月来稿六件增至九月的四十八件，十月的五十五件。肥乡在县书曹玉昆同志领导下，由八月份的七件增至十月份的八十四件。宁南在县书冯骥同志与县长崔绍武同志领导下，由每月三、四件增至二十七件。冀县八月来仅十七件，十月亦增至三十三件。
