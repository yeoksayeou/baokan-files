    Regarding Chiang Kai-shek's Treacherous Civil War
    Taiyue Soldiers Donate Funds After Ceasefire
    Jincheng Ceasefire: Battalion Commander Zhai Bitterly Recounts the Plight of the Miscellaneous Troops
    [This newspaper, Yangcheng, 13th dispatch] The Kuomintang and Yan Xishan troops in the liberated areas recently launched a donation campaign to oppose Chiang Kai-shek's treacherous civil war and support the self-defense front. Initial donations amounted to 23,760 yuan. They also sent a letter to Commander Chen Geng of the Taiyue Column, stating: "Only the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army are the bulwarks of maintaining China's independence, peace, and democracy, and the patriotic self-defense war launched by the Eighth Route Army for justice is not isolated." Liu Daming, a Major and Deputy Regiment Commander of the First Brigade, Second Regiment of the surrendered Chiang army, said during the donation: "Today, I don't have the chance to personally go to the front line to eliminate the invading Chiang army. I can only donate money to express my sincerity and determination to oppose Chiang Kai-shek's treacherous civil war."
    [This newspaper, Jilu Yu Frontline Reporter Group, 14th dispatch] Major Zhai Zhengren, Battalion Commander of the Third Battalion of the 355th Regiment of the 119th Brigade of the 68th Division of the Chiang army, who voluntarily ordered his entire battalion to lay down their weapons on the Jincheng front, has now arrived in our army's rear. He recently bitterly recounted to reporters the situation in which the original Northwest Army had been excluded and eliminated by Chiang Kai-shek's direct line troops over the years, and he was extremely indignant. Battalion Commander Zhai is a veteran of the Northwest Army for more than 20 years. He said: The 68th Division was originally the 143rd Division of the 29th Army and participated in the defense of the Great Wall. After the July 7th Incident, it continued to fight against Japan in the Henan and Hubei areas, but Chiang Kai-shek ordered this meritorious Northwest Army to be reorganized seven times. By May of this year, only four regiments remained, and half of them were wiped out in this civil war. Northwest Army officers are generally unable to be promoted. The current company commanders and platoon leaders are mostly veteran officers with eight, nine, or more than ten years of service. In May of this year, it was reorganized into the 68th Army, and more than 500 lieutenants were dismissed, wandering around Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, and the Luo River area. Their families, old and young, all relied on selling clothes for a living. In the Luo River area, a retired battalion commander's wife hanged herself, and he jumped into a well with his child; Yin Chuanyu, a deputy battalion commander who worked with him, had been a lieutenant for eleven years and is now a vagrant. Battalion Commander Zhai said sadly: "We sold our lives for more than ten years, old, weak, and disabled, who in the Kuomintang has ever cared? Eight years of bloody war of resistance were to get rid of Japanese enslavement, but after the victory, we were betrayed. American advisors were sent to the army, we wore the hats of American slaves, and became their watchdogs. On the civil war front, the miscellaneous soldiers didn't even aim when they fired their guns, and some didn't even fire at all." Battalion Commander Zhai's order for all officers and soldiers of the battalion to collectively lay down their arms in Miaozhuang on the Jincheng front was a powerful blow to Chiang Kai-shek's treacherous civil war.

    反对蒋贼卖国内战
    太岳罢战蒋军献金
    鄄城罢战翟营长痛述杂牌苦
    【本报阳城十三日电】解放区内之蒋阎官兵顷发起反对蒋介石卖国内战、支援自卫前线的献金运动。初步献金达二万三千七百六十元。并致函太岳纵队司令员陈赓将军称：“只有共产党八路军才是维护中国独立、和平、民主的堡垒，八路军为正义而展开的爱国自卫战争不是孤立的”。被解放之蒋军第一旅第二团少校团副刘大明于献金时说：“今天尚无机会亲上火线消灭进犯蒋军，只有献金表示我反对蒋介石卖国内战的诚意与决心。”
    【本报冀鲁豫前线记者团十四日电】鄄城前线自动下令全营放下武器的蒋军六十八师一一九旅三五五团第三营少校营长翟正仁，现已抵达我军后方。顷对记者痛述原西北军几年来被蒋介石嫡系排斥消灭的情形，异常愤慨。翟营长是二十多年的老西北军人，彼称：六十八师原为二十九军之一四三师，曾参加长城抗战。七七事变后，仍在河南、湖北地区对日作战，但蒋介石对这一支抗日有功的西北军，却下令改编七次，到今年五月，只剩四个团，这次利用来打内战，又被消灭一半；西北军的军官一概不能提升。现在的连长、排长，大都是八九年或十几年以上的老军官。今年五月整编为六十八军，有五百多个尉官被编掉，流落在郑州、开封、洛河一带。家属老幼，全靠当卖衣物为生。洛河一个退伍营长，一家三口，老婆上了吊，他抱着孩子跳了井；和他同事的副营长尹川玉，当了十一年上尉，现在变成了流浪汉。翟营长悲痛的说：“卖了十几年的命，老弱残废，国民党谁管过呢？八年流血抗战，是为了摆脱日本的奴役，胜利后，我们被出卖了。军队里派来了美国顾问，我们戴上美国奴隶帽子，当了他们的看门狗。在内战前线上，杂牌士兵打枪都不瞄准，有的连枪也不打。翟营长在鄄城前线的苗庄下令全营官兵集体放下武器，对于蒋介石的卖国内战乃一有力打击。
