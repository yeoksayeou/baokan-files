　　Changzhi City Smashes Chiang Kai-shek Special Agent Conspiracy Riot Case
    Combines Anti-Espionage with War Preparations
    [Report from this newspaper in Changzhi] On the evening of October 24th, the Changzhi City Public Security Bureau smashed a Chiang Kai-shek special agent conspiracy riot case, and the ringleaders Li Chunhao and Guo Weifang (also known as Guo Lailian), along with five others, have been arrested. Li Chunhao was the "Loyal Righteous National Salvation Army" battalion commander, and Guo Weifang was the deputy company commander. A letter of appointment issued by Gao Bingrong, director of the Chiang bandit Military Affairs Commission Jin Southeast "Loyal Righteous National Salvation Army" Preparatory Committee, was also seized. According to their confession, they had been lurking in Changzhi for a year, and the organizational system consisted of battalions, companies, platoons, and squads. Their main activities were: 1. Spreading rumors of regime change. 2. Shooting from the shadows; Guo Weifang alone killed three people outside the South Gate and two people outside the West Gate. 3. Investigating the situation of various organs and factories. 4. Escorting special agents and landlords who were being struggled against to the KMT-controlled areas, having already sent away eight people. 5. At an appropriate time, coordinating from within and without to launch a riot. They were equipped with a number of rifles and pistols. When Chiang's planes bombed Changzhi City on the 22nd, they took the opportunity to spread rumors and shoot from the shadows. They were apprehended, and are currently under interrogation. This incident has aroused boundless anger among the citizens of Changzhi. The whole city is now launching an anti-espionage movement in conjunction with war preparations.
    As Chiang Kai-shek launches a large-scale invasion of our Yubei Liberated Area, the Shangdang Central Area Changzhi County Headquarters and Changzhi City held a rally on the 23rd of this month, urgently mobilizing the people of the entire county and city to smash the attack of the traitor Chiang Kai-shek. The rally pointed out three important tasks at present: Thoroughly carry out the emptying of houses and clearing of the fields; reorganize the militia, prepare weapons and ammunition, and be ready to strike at the Chiang puppet troops at any time; implement emergency martial law throughout the county, eliminate traitors and spies, and break the claws and teeth of the KMT-puppet regime. After Mayor Yang convened a meeting on the afternoon of the 22nd to ideologically mobilize the managers of shops and factories throughout the city, grief and indignation filled the entire city. More than 26,000 citizens, every household preparing for war, had a planned and organized evacuation of materials from factories, shops, and stalls over three days and nights from the evening of the 22nd to the afternoon of the 25th. The determination and atmosphere to completely eliminate the invaders was revealed in everyone's expressions and conversations. The militiamen on Wangshang Street said heroically: "Landmine warfare, sparrow warfare, sniping warfare, come on, we have ready-made things prepared for the dog days." The county and city Armed Forces Committee also selected strong militiamen for explosives training. The entire county has now entered a state of widespread and intense self-defense war preparations.
