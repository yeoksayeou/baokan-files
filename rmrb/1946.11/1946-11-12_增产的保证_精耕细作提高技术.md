Guaranteeing Increased Production
Intensive Farming and Improved Techniques
Li Cheng Joint Office

    After the demand for "increased production exceeding any previous year" was put forward, the leadership, based on the experience of the previous two years of production campaigns, emphasized the importance of intensive farming and technical guidance, which played a significant role in this year's increased production. At the beginning of last year's spring plowing, the leadership organized technical personnel who had been trained at the Border Region Agricultural and Forestry Bureau to hold four agricultural technology training classes in different districts, training a total of 342 people, studying agricultural techniques such as fertilizer use, warm water seed soaking, and tree and cotton planting. The trained cadres went down to the villages and, in conjunction with experienced old farmers and labor heroes, formed the core of guidance for improving production techniques; constantly learning from the masses and adopting a method of combining science and experience to promote farming techniques. On this basis, the large-scale production campaign of this year was launched, and the local technology committees were extremely active, especially in the research of special crops such as cotton, Golden Queen corn, and indigo, achieving great success in technology. The county established 137 technology research associations, absorbing 1,060 experienced old farmers, as well as labor heroes, which further improved and promoted production technology. The following is a summary of the technology committee's activities throughout the year:

    During the sowing and weeding campaign, Shen Yuqin, a labor hero from Renzhuang, saw that the masses were unwilling to weed wheat, so he convened the technology committee to study the benefits of weeding wheat, organized the masses to discuss, and concluded two points: first, it can loosen the soil and remove weeds, so there will be no weeds in the subsequent stubble fields; second, the loosened soil is conducive to ventilation and absorption of sunlight, and can conserve water when it rains. After research in various villages, a wheat weeding campaign was launched, and 79,549 mu were weeded out of 115,248 mu of wheat fields in the county.

    In terms of fertilization, Shi Cunjin from Huojia Kiln promoted the technology committee to study that manure from mules and horses is good for sloping land, night soil is good for sunny land, and ash fertilizer is best for cotton fields. Shi Cunjin's cotton field last year grew well with ash fertilizer, but poorly with night soil. He used this practical example and the research of the technology committee to overcome the masses' technical viewpoint of underestimating technology, "clever work is not as good as clumsy fertilization." As a result, this year's fertilization followed the call of the technology committee and applied more fertilizer, with an average of 50 loads per mu, 5 loads more per mu than last year. Zhao Muqun, a labor hero from Henan, and the committee studied the method of cultivating wasteland, and found that wasteland fertilizer is good for red soil, which can loosen the soil, absorb sunlight and moisture, and improve the soil. In this way, the technology committees of various villages studied the fertilization techniques before sowing according to the specific situation, and organized wasteland cultivation and massive fertilizer accumulation. The county averaged 30.5 loads per mu, 6.4 loads more per mu than last year. In sowing, in addition to selecting specialized tillers, research was also conducted on plowing the land in spring. The Huojia Kiln Technology Committee studied that cloddy land should be deep, and plowed land should be shallow, because the spring wind is poisonous, the deeper the plowing, the drier the land, which cannot nourish the seedlings or prevent drought. Especially in cotton, except for a part of the Fourth and Second Districts with more cotton planting experience, most other areas lacked cotton planting experience. Therefore, the technology committees of all villages in the county especially studied the experience of Dong Taoqi, a labor hero from Wangjiazhuang in the Fifth District. That is, more raking and plowing, using a drill to make ridges, and good sowing to catch seedlings. Some people were afraid of dry seedlings and did not listen to the technology committee, and as a result, did not catch the seedlings. Seeing that the situation was not good, Dong Taoqi personally went to the county cooperative to buy 80 kilograms of seeds, and explained the method to the masses again for replanting. As a result, all 161 mu of cotton in the village came out. Shi Cunjin from Huojia Kiln, seeing that there were not enough cotton seedlings, convened a technology meeting to study the method of transplanting cotton, bringing the soil of the cotton seedlings themselves. Seedlings from shady land were transplanted to shady land, and seedlings from sunny land were transplanted to sunny land, which made it easier to survive. As a result, 28 mu of cotton were transplanted in the village. In addition, in the technology of land repair and warm water seed soaking, the Qiushuyuan Technology Committee of the Third District studied that valley should be planted first in sunny land and then in shady land, because sunny land faces the sun and dries quickly, while shady slopes nourish the seedlings. In the harrowing of land, a comb harrow was created, which has more thorns than the old harrow, and the front and back thorns are staggered, so that one harrowing is equivalent to two harrowings of the old harrow. Zhao Muqun from Henan created a small harrow for convenience of use, which is fast and convenient, and can also be used by bad livestock. In this way, 169,506 mu were harrowed out of 238,625 mu of autumn land in the county, and some were harrowed twice. Warm water seed soaking was carried out more universally throughout the county.

    In the weeding, seedling pulling, and cotton trimming campaigns, technology is the most important thing. The leadership put the technical issue in the first place this season, especially for cotton pruning, topping, removing suckers, and "taking off pants." The masses urgently demanded technical guidance, and technology was particularly active during this period. The Fifth District concentrated all village cadres in the district to inspect the seedling pulling technology of Che Yuan, which was the best. The Che Yuan Technology Committee studied small hoe seedling pulling, and put forward the slogan: "Bury the roots of millet, expose the roots of valley, small hoe seedling pulling is the most suitable." The leadership used Che Yuan's small hoe seedling pulling to promote it throughout the district. Zhao Muqun from Henan used the method of exchanging labor in seedling pulling to carry out mutual inspection of seedling pulling technology. Old hero Shi Cunjin and his six apprentices, after researching seedling pulling, proposed "Valley an inch, fertilize the top," "One step old San'an, rolling an egg in the middle." His apprentices went to various natural villages to convene researchers from each team to study, realizing the call of the technology committee. In addition to general calls, the specific method was for old men (with good technology) to work with women and children, pulling seedlings while teaching them technology, overcoming the phenomenon of women only gossiping. In weeding, the technology committee adopted the method of ditching the ground, checking the technology while teaching the young people to learn technology, overcoming the phenomenon of the past when the old oxen turned around and no one cared about anyone. In order to respect technicians, the mutual aid society stipulated that weeding was calculated by technology, that is, those with good technology would get more work points, which greatly rewarded the technical experience of the elderly. In cotton trimming, Li Chongqi from Qiushuyuan promoted the technology committee to adopt the method of practical experiments in the field, teaching women and children how to prune, top, and remove suckers. Dong Taoqi from Nan Village, the former tiger, also used the method of practical teaching in the field to promote technology. Because the heroes and the technology committee constantly researched and guided, the young people respected the technicians and apprentices, and improved the status of the elderly, great achievements were made in the tense and enthusiastic weeding campaign. The county has 98,495 mu of valley, and 100,068 mu have been weeded three times. 25,756.7 mu of Golden Queen corn have been weeded, and 3,559.9 mu have been weeded four times.

    In the autumn plowing and wheat planting campaign, the technology committees of various villages successively studied autumn plowing, seed selection, and the promotion of 169 wheat. In particular, the characteristics of 169 wheat were studied to solve the masses' doubts about 169. Shi Cunjin from Huojia Kiln saw that the masses were unwilling to plant 169, and the masses nicknamed it "One Left Empty" (meaning no seeds). Shi Cunjin discussed with the technology committee, and Fan Village in his village paid attention to planting 169 and harvested more wheat. The local climate is dry nine years out of ten, and 169 wheat is drought-resistant and wind-resistant. These characteristics were used to solve the masses' doubts. As a result, 383 mu of 169 wheat were planted out of 500 mu of wheat fields in the village. According to statistics from the four districts of the county, a total of 16,136.6 mu of 169 wheat were planted, 7,845.8 mu more than last year. In wheat planting, various villages created many new methods for seed soaking, using salt water for seed soaking, and some places used lime water for wheat seed disinfection. A total of 2,171 mu in the county were soaked in salt water, 497.8 mu in the Fourth and Fifth Districts were soaked in lime water, 4,605.5 mu in grass and wood ash, and 5,467 mu in warm water.

    In seed selection, Shen Yuqin from Renzhuang and the technology committee studied the seed selection method. After the technology committee selected the seeds, they were distributed to the masses. It is planned to plant 300 mu of Golden Queen corn next year, requiring 1,000 kilograms of seeds. In the selection process, attention was paid to selecting robust seeds without diseases and insect pests, seeds that do not fall over, and seeds with non-drooping ears, and ear selection should be done by trimming the head and removing the tail. When selecting valley seeds, the mutual aid brigade selected the most suitable seeds for the local climate in the village's valley fields. Attention was paid to large ears, full seeds, full codes, tight seeds, and no diseases and insect pests. Currently, 1 stone and 7 dou of Wawuli valley seeds, 3 dou of Hen's Mouth, 5 dou of Glass Foxtail Millet, 5 dou of Black Wuqing Valley, and 1 stone of Qinggu Lumingqing have been selected, totaling 3 stones and 9 dou, which is enough to plant 600 mu of land. In the past, villages suffered a lot because they did not select seeds, and all villages carried out field seed selection.

    On autumn plowing land, the local technology committees guided the mutual aid groups to select good tillers and good managers of livestock, so that they could cultivate the land well and manage the livestock well and cherish animal power. Dong Zhongshu's group in Wangjiazhuang selected three people, including a group leader who could cultivate the land and cherish livestock, to form a cultivation group. During the rest of cultivation, they also discussed cultivation techniques on how to cherish livestock, so that the landlords and livestock owners were very relieved, and did not worry about poor cultivation or poor livestock management. In addition, this year's autumn plowing, the whole county generally adopted no hoeing, which preserves moisture and kills insects, which has become a habit of autumn planting in Licheng.

    In short, in the 1946 large-scale production campaign, due to the attention of the leadership to this issue and the urgent demands of the masses, the technology committees of various villages studied agricultural technologies in various seasons, which has formed a regular working system. Therefore, it has played a considerable role in this year's increased production, increasing the county's agricultural production by 142,364.8 shi.

    增产的保证
    精耕细作提高技术
    黎城联合办公室
    当“超过已往任何一年”的增产要求提出后，领导上根据以往两年生产运动的经验，强调提出精耕细作技术指导的重要，对今年的增产起到重大的作用。去年春耕开始，领导上组织了曾在边区农林局受训的技术人员，分区召开了四个农业技术训练班，共训练了三百四十二人，研究了肥料使用、温汤浸种、植树种棉等农作技术。受训的干部下去，结合有经验的老农，以及劳动英雄等组成提高生产技术的指导核心；不断的向群众学习，采用科学与经验结合的方法推动耕作技术。在这个基础上，开展今年的大生产运动，各地技术委员会极为活跃，特别是对棉花、金皇后、蓝等特种作物的研究，技术上收到很大成绩。全县成立了一百三十七个技术研究会，吸收有经验的老农共一千零六十个，此外尚有劳动英雄参加，这使生产技术更加提高和推广。现将技术委员会全年活动情况概述如下：
    在下种锄苗运动中，仁庄劳动英雄申玉芹，见群众不愿锄麦，他就召开技术委员会，研究锄麦的好处，组织群众讨论，得出两点：一是能松土去草，以后改茬地没草；二是土壤松了宜通风吸收日光，下雨能保存水份。各村经研究后，开展了锄麦运动，全县麦地一一五二四八亩，锄了七九五四九亩。
    在施肥上，霍家窑石寸金推动技术委员会，研究出背坡地上骡马肥好，阳地上圊肥好，棉花地上灰肥最好。石寸金去年的棉花地，上灰肥长的好，上圊肥的长的糟，他用这实际例子和技委会的研究，克服群众“巧做造不如拙上肥”的轻视技术观点。结果今年上肥执行了技委会的号召，并多上了肥，每亩平均上五十驮，比去年每亩多上五驮。河南劳英赵木群和委会研究熏荒办法，研究出荒肥上红土好，既能松土吸收日光水分，又能改造土壤。这样各村技委会都根据具体情况，研究了下种前的施肥技术，并组织熏荒大量积肥，全县每亩平均上三○·五驮，比去年每亩多上六·四驮。在下种中，各地除了选专门的耕地种地能手外，并在春天翻地上作了研究。霍家窑技术委员会，研究垡地宜深，翻地宜浅，因春风毒，耕多深干多深，不能养垧不能防旱。特别是在棉花上，全县除四、二区一部分地区种棉较有经验外，其他大部分地区在种棉经验上是欠缺的，因此全县各村技委会，特别研究了五区王家庄劳动英雄董桃气的经验。即多耙多犁，用耧挑垅，撒里种好捉苗。有些群众恐怕干垧，没有听技委会的话，结果没有捉住苗儿。董桃气见势不好，又亲自到县联社买籽八十斤，并再把办法给群众说，进行补栽，结果全村一百六十一亩棉花，全都出来了。霍家窑石寸金，见到棉花不够苗，就召开技术会研究移棉办法，带上棉苗的本身土，阴地苗移到阴地，阳地苗移到阳地，这样容易活，结果全村移了二十八亩棉。此外在修地和温汤浸种技术上，三区秋树垣技委会研究种谷先种阳后种背，因阳地向阳快干，背坡地养垧。在耙地上创造梳耙，这就是比旧耙的刺儿多，前后刺儿钉错开，这样耙一耙顶旧耙两耙。河南赵木群为了便利使用起见，创造小耙又快又便利，歹牲口也能用。这样全县秋地二三八六二五亩即耙过一六九五○六亩，还有的耙两次。温汤浸种全县各地较普遍进行了。
    在锄苗拔苗修理棉花运动中，技术是顶要紧的一件事。领导上在这一季把技术问题提到第一位，尤其是对棉花打杈、打顶、打油条、脱裤子，群众最迫切要求技术指导，这个时期中技术特别活跃。五区集中全区村干部，检查车元拔苗技术最好。车元技委会研究小锄拔苗，提出口号是：“埋根黍子露根谷，小锄拔苗最合适”，领导上就用车元的小锄拔苗推动了全区。河南赵木群在拔苗中用变工的方式，开展互相检查拔苗技术。老英雄石寸金和他的六个徒弟，在拔苗中经研究提出“谷寸，顶上肥。”“一步老三安，中间滚鸡蛋。”他的徒弟分头到各自然村召集各组的研究员研究，实现技委会的号召。除了一般号召以外，具体做法是老汉（技术好的）结合妇女儿童，一面拔苗，一面教他们技术，克服了妇女光说闲话的现象，在锄苗中，技委会采用打垅锄地法，一面检查技术，一面教青年们学技术，克服了过去老牛大回头的谁也不管谁的现象。为了尊敬技师，互助社规定锄苗中按技术计工，就是技术好的多加工，这大大奖励了老人们的技术经验。在棉花修理上，秋树垣李崇奇，推动技术委员用到地实际试验的办法，教会了妇女儿童打杈打顶打油条办法。南村原老虎五区董桃气，也用到地实际教的办法推动技术。由于英雄和技委会不断研究指导，青年们尊敬技师学徒弟，提高老人的地位，所以在紧张热烈的锄苗运动中，做出很大成绩。全县有谷九八四九五亩，锄过三次的有一○○六八亩，金皇后二五七五六·七亩，锄过四次的三五五九·九亩。
    在秋耕种麦运动中，各村技术委员会对秋耕选种及推广一六九小麦，先后作了研究。特别是研究一六九小麦的特点，解决了群众对一六九怀疑的思想。霍家窑石寸金见到群众对一六九不愿意种，群众送外号叫一留光（没有籽的意思）。石寸金就和技委会研究，他村樊家注意种一六九多打了麦子，本地风土又是十年九旱，一六九小麦是耐旱抗风。用这些特点解决群众的怀疑思想，结果全村五○○亩麦地种了一六九小麦三百八十三亩。全县四个区统计共种一六九小麦一六一三六·六亩，比去年多种七八四五·八亩。在种麦中各村浸种都创造了许多新办法，使用盐水浸种，有的地用石灰水进行麦种消毒，共计全县用盐水浸过的有二一七一亩，四五区用石灰水浸过的四九七·八亩，草木灰四六○五·五亩，温汤浸种五四六七亩。
    在选种上，仁庄申玉芹和技委会研究了选种办法，由技委会选好后，再分给群众，计划明年种金皇后三百亩，需种籽一千斤。在选的当中注意了选粗壮没有病虫害的，不倒的、穗子不下垂的，进行穗选应做到剪头去尾。在选谷种时，以互助大队进行在全村谷地选，选最适合本地风土的，谷注意穗大、籽饱、满码儿、籽紧、没有病虫害的，现已选出瓦物理谷种一石七斗，母鸡嘴三斗，玻璃莠五斗，黑乌青谷五斗，青谷露米青一石，共选出三石九斗，足够六百亩地种。过去各村因不选种吃亏不少，各村都进行了田间选种。
    在秋耕土地上，各地技委会指导互助组选出耕地好把式和经理牲口的把式，一方面耕好地一方面能经理好牲口爱护畜力。王家庄董仲书组，就是选出能耕地又能爱护牲口的组长等三个人，组成耕地小组，在一块耕地休息时，还座谈耕地技术怎样爱护牲口，这样地主牲口主都很放心，不怕耕不好地经理不好牲口。另外今年秋耕，全县都普遍采用不耢，既保垧又杀虫，这已成黎城的秋种习惯。
    总之在四六年大生产运动中，由于领导对这问题注意，和群众迫切要求，使各村技委会研究各季农业技术，已形成经常工作的制度，所以对今年增产起了相当作用，使全县农业增产一四二三六四·八石。
