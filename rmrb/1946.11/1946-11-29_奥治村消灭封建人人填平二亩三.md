　　Aozhi Village Eradicates Feudalism: Everyone Fills in 2.3 Mu
    [This Dispatch from Changzhi] Aozhi Village in Pingshun (an old revolutionary base area) began its rent reduction movement in late October and has now concluded. After the rent reduction movement in 1942 and the rent investigation and reduction movement in 1944, most of the peasants in the village had already turned themselves around, but 87 out of the village's 367 households still lacked land to cultivate; 16 landlord households still occupied a large amount of land, and the big landlord Zhao Jianshu still lived off rent collection. In order to allow the peasants to thoroughly turn themselves around, at the beginning of the movement, the leadership proposed "completely eliminating feudalism and realizing land to the tiller" to support the peasants, and put forward the specific slogan: "Cut off the tail, fill in the holes." After the active elements coordinated, organized, and deliberated, the broad masses were drawn into the movement, and even honest peasants who had never participated in the struggle automatically participated in complaining about their sufferings. After the final reckoning with the 16 landlord households, a total of more than 240 mu of land, 145 rooms, and more than 400 shi of grain were returned to the peasants. In the distribution of fruits, special attention was paid to "filling in and making up the difference." Now the village has an average of more than 2.3 mu of land per person, and the masses said, "This is a complete turnaround!" Enthusiasm is unprecedentedly high, and winter production is now being actively carried out.

　　奥治村消灭封建人人填平二亩三
    【本报长治讯】平顺奥治村（老区）十月下旬即开始查减运动，现已结束。该村经过四二年减租与四四年查减运动，大部农民已经翻身，但全村三百六十七户中仍有八十七户缺少地种；十六户地主仍霸占着大量土地，大地主赵建书还是靠收租过活。为使农民彻底翻身，运动开始，领导上即提出：“彻底消灭封建，实现耕者有其田”，给农民撑腰，并提出具体口号：“割尾巴，填窟窿”。经过积极分子的串通、组织酝酿，广大群众都卷入运动，过去从未参加过斗争的老实农民也自动参加诉苦。经过对十六户地主的最后清算，共退给农民土地二百四十余亩，房一百四十五间，粮四百余石。在果实分配中，特别注意了“填平补齐”，现全村每人平均都有二亩三分以上的土地，群众都说：“这才算彻底翻身啦”。情绪空前高涨，现正积极进行冬季生产。
