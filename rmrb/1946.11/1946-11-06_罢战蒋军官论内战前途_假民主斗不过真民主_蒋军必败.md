　　【Benbao Weixian, 3rd dispatch】Chiang's army officers, who laid down their arms on the front lines of Hebei, Shandong and Henan, discussed the future of the war based on their personal experiences. Lu Dachang, a second lieutenant and young tank driver in the armored corps, said: The sophistication of weapons cannot determine the final victory or defeat. I am a tank soldier. When the Third Division was routed at Dali Village in Kaocheng, five or six of our tanks were set on fire by the Eighth Route Army. Hand grenades and machine guns rained down like a storm, making it impossible to deal with them. Our machine gun fire was useless. Looking up, we saw that the Eighth Route Army was not afraid of our equipment at all. They even climbed onto the tanks and shouted: If you use tanks to attack, we will destroy you inside the tanks. As they were saying this, hand grenades were thrown into the hatch, and the vehicle immediately caught fire. It was really scary. The commander, the gunner, and I all abandoned the vehicle and ran. This shows that Chiang Kai-shek's reliance on American weapons to fight the civil war is not a good idea. In this battle, only two of the fifteen tanks in our Third Battalion escaped. Shi Xinyuan, a major in the 212th Brigade of the 41st Division, said: I personally saw the Eighth Route Army fighting bravely and calmly, and the common people enthusiastically helped them. Wherever the Kuomintang army goes, the common people all flee. Ren Changlin, adjutant of the artillery battalion of the 122nd Brigade of the 41st Division, said: Chinese people love China. Who wants to sacrifice for the traitor Chiang Kai-shek after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War? If more people lay down their weapons like I did, Chiang Kai-shek will not be able to continue fighting. Several platoon leaders of the 41st Division's artillery company said: "Those who win the people prosper, and those who lose the people perish." Now is the time when fake democracy is fighting against true democracy. The fake cannot defeat the real. Chiang's army will surely be defeated. This is the common conclusion of our officers who have laid down their weapons.

　　罢战蒋军官论内战前途
    假民主斗不过真民主
    蒋军必败
    【本报威县三日电】冀鲁豫前线放下武器的蒋军校尉军官，以亲身经历论述战局前途。装甲兵团青年坦克司机陆达昌少尉说：武器的精良，并不能决定最后胜败。我是坦克兵，在考城大李寨三师溃退时，我们五六辆坦克被八路军打得起了火，手榴弹和机枪像狂风暴雨的打来，实在无法对付，我们用机枪扫射也无用。从＠望空，看见八路军根本不怕我们这玩意。他们居然爬上坦克喊：你们用坦克进攻，我们就把你们消灭在坦克里。正说着，手榴弹就往＠望空里掷进来，车子立刻起了火，实在怕人。车长和射手连我三个人都丢车跑了。从这里说明蒋介石依靠美国武器打内战，也并不妙。这次战斗，我们三营十五辆坦克，只逃走两辆。四十一师二一二旅师新元少校说：我亲眼见八路军作战英勇沉着，老百姓热烈帮助。国民党军到处，老百姓都逃避一空。四十一师一二二旅，迫炮营副官任昌林说：中国人爱中国，谁愿意在抗日胜利之后，再替蒋介石卖国贼牺牲。像我这样放下武器的一多起来，蒋介石就不能打下去了。四十一师几个迫炮连的排长说：“得民者昌，失民者亡”，现在是假民主与真民主打架之时，假的斗不过真的，蒋军必败已是我们放下武器军官的共同的结论。
