    How to Write Battle Communications?
    Yu Jia

    When a battle ends, swift, accurate, and specific news reports are as valuable as the operation itself in terms of military propaganda. However, in a significant battle or campaign, news reports alone are sometimes insufficient to explain the war situation. At this point, longer battle communications are needed to accomplish the reporting task. Obviously, battle communications differ from battle news; besides needing to be clear, specific, and swift, they also require prominent descriptions of battle scenes, brief portrayals of heroic figures, and concise summaries of the battle (different from the results). Its purpose is to report the war in more vivid language to supplement the shortcomings of news reports. If we compare battle news to a two-dimensional chart, then communication is a three-dimensional model.

    For example, when we saw the news of annihilating the enemy at Dayang Lake (published in this newspaper on September 10th), it only left an impression in our minds: "Oh! The Kuomintang's direct line Third Division (formerly the Tenth Army) was wiped out by us!" After reading the battle communication of the Dayang Lake annihilation battle (published in this newspaper on September 19th), we more clearly understood the heroic and tragic nature of this battle, how our heroes used their bodies to engage in the most brutal struggle with the stubborn enemy; we also know that the enemy, who have already become fascist, are not as easy to subdue as we imagined, and they can even make nine assaults; we see even more deeply that the people's army is bound to win, and the anti-people's army, even with sophisticated weapons and strong combat effectiveness, cannot escape the fate of collapse.

    Writing battle communications is so important, but it is often not easy to do well. Some are written as duplicate versions of the news, making people feel lengthy and boring, and not as simple and clear as the news; some are written like "killing declarations," after a few mobilization slogans and a few soldiers' vows, followed by the booming sound of artillery and the crackling of machine guns, and finally a statistic of the battle results: how many bullets were obtained, how many guns were captured... It is confusing as to when and where the battle took place, which part of the enemy was fought, what were the combat intentions of the enemy and us, and what role did this battle play on a certain front? The worst thing is to write unclear and unorganized accounts, rambling about the preparations before the battle, and reporting the results in a fragmented way, especially when writing about the battle process, dragging in all the people and things, mentioning this and talking about that, but without explaining anything clearly. The author seems to regard the reader as a participant in the battle, endlessly recalling every scene he is familiar with. He completely forgets that the communication he writes is mainly for people who know nothing about the battle. As a result, not only does the reader not understand the battle, but they are pulled into a fog and cannot find their way.

    So, how can we write good battle communications? Here, we might as well take the Dayang Lake annihilation battle as an example again: This communication is divided into three parts: The first part clearly introduces the time, location, combat intentions of the enemy and us, and the preparation and mobilization of our army before the battle, which is one of the conditions that communication should have. Then, the second part is a prominent introduction to the tense battle scene – this is the main reporting part of the communication, and at the same time, it shows the activities of the characters; it writes about the heroic fighting of our army, the stubborn resistance of the enemy, and it is written vividly and compactly. When reading, it seems like we are on the scene, standing shoulder to shoulder with the soldiers, shouting "Charge! Kill!" and rushing bravely into the enemy camp. This is the power of communication! The reason why it has such an infection is that it is not a general or broad description, but uses the most prominent scene to summarize the entire battle process, the so-called "seeing the whole from one point," to avoid the problem of "seeing the forest but not the trees." The last part of this communication is already the end of the battle and the evaluation and explanation of this battle, which is also very important in the communication. It skillfully tells us that the Third Division has been completely defeated and explains that Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary army, which "launches wars for unjust causes," will inevitably fall in the face of the great power of the people.

    In short, the main point of writing battle communications is to report the battle vividly, not to narrate it flatly and fall into generality. As for the example above, it is only an example, and you don't have to be constrained by its form, and you should create more. I hope that the writing comrades standing on the forefront of the news front will report more on the greatest and most magnificent scenes in the current people's war, so that all the people will be moved to tears and excited to cheer by your wonderful descriptions.

    怎样写战斗通讯？
    羽嘉
    一个战斗结束，须有迅速、准确、具体的消息报导，这在军事宣传意义上是有着和作战同样的价值。但在一个重要的战斗或战役中，仅有消息的报导，有时是不够说明战争情况的。这时，就需要较长的战斗通讯来达成报导任务。显然，战斗通讯不同于战斗消息，它除了同样应具备明确、具体、迅速等条件外，还需有突出的战斗场面介绍，英雄人物的简短描写，以及战斗总结（不同于战果）的扼要说明，它的目的在于用更形象生动的文字来报导战争，以补消息之不足。假若我们把战斗消息比作一幅平面的图表，那么通讯就是一个立体的模型。
    举一个例子来说，当我们看到大杨湖歼敌的消息（载九月十日本报）时，只在脑子里留下一个：“哦！蒋嫡系部队第三师（原第十军）被我们消灭了！”的印象，等到看了大杨湖歼灭战的通讯（载九月十九日本报）以后，才更清楚的了解到这次战斗的英勇壮烈，我们的英雄们如何用自己的身体和顽敌作最残酷的搏斗；也知道已经法西斯化了的敌军，不像我们想像的那样容易降服，他们居然也能作九次冲锋；更深刻的看到一点，那就是人民军队必然胜利，反人民军队纵使武器精锐，战斗力顽强，也逃不出溃灭的命运。
    写战斗通讯既如此重要，但一般往往不容易写好，有的写成了消息的复版，使人读起来感到冗长乏味，反不如消息的简单明了；有的写成了类似“杀敌宣言”一类的东西，几个动员口号，几个战士的誓言过后，接着便是轰呀轰的大炮声，劈劈拍拍的机枪声，最后来一个战果统计：得多少多少子弹，缴获多少多少枪支…………叫人摸不清，到底战斗是在何时何地发生，和那一部分敌人作战，敌我的作战意图是什么，这次战斗在某一个战线上所起的作用是什么？最糟糕的是写成不清不白的流水账，罗罗嗦嗦的叙述了作战前的准备，又琐琐碎碎的报告了战果，特别写战斗经过时，把所有的人和事都拉了上去，提提这，说说那，却没有一个交代得清楚明白，作者仿佛把读者也当着战斗的参与者，滔滔不休的在那里回味着他所熟习的每一个场面，他完全忘记了他所写的通讯主要的是为了给那些对战斗毫无所知的人看的。其结果不但没有让读者了解了战斗，反而把读者拉到五里雾中，摸不着边际。
    那么，侄底怎样才能写好战斗通讯？这里，我们不妨再拿大杨湖歼灭战作例：这篇通讯分三个部分：第一部分明确的介绍了战斗的时间、地点、敌我作战意图，以及我军作战前的准备与动员，这也就是通讯所应具备的条件之一，接着，第二部分便是一个突出紧张的战斗场面的介绍——这是通讯的主要报导部分，同时也就展现了人物的活动；它写出了我军的英勇奋战，写出了敌军的顽强死抗，写得生动，写得紧凑，诵读之下，仿佛有身临其境，与战士们并肩齐臂，高呼着“冲！杀！”勇猛直奔敌营的感情。这正是通讯的力量！它之所以有如此感染，原因是不一般、不泛泛的描写，而用一个最突出的场面来概括全部的战斗经过，所谓“从一点看全面”，以避免“只见林子不见树”的毛病。这篇通讯的最后部分，已经是战斗尾声和对这次战斗的评价与说明，这在通讯里也是很重要的，它技巧地告诉了我们，第三师已经全部溃灭，而且说明了“师出无名”的蒋介石反动军队，在伟大人民力量的面前，必定要倒下。
    总之，写战斗通讯，主要一点是突出生动的报导战斗，不要平铺直叙，落于一般。至于上面所举的例子，仅仅是例子而已，不必受它的形式拘束，应多多创造。希望站在新闻战线最前哨的写作同志们，多多报导当前人民战争中最伟大最壮烈的场面，让所有的人民为你们精彩的描写而感动得落泪，激奋得欢呼。
