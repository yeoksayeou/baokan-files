　　Chiang Kai-shek's Planes Rampage!
    Innocent People in Shengyingji, Weixian County, Suffer 18 Casualties
    [News from Weixian County, Jinnan] At 10:00 AM on October 20th, two Chiang Kai-shek planes, gray in color and bearing the Kuomintang flag, flew in from the southeast. After circling over Weixian County three times, they flew low over Shengyingji market, 15 li northwest of the county seat. A mule and horse fair was being held there. The planes strafed the crowd with machine guns, killing six people and wounding twelve. The masses shouted: This is ironclad proof of Chiang Kai-shek's attack on the people! We must unite and jointly crush the bandit Chiang's offensive! (Yang Yuping)
