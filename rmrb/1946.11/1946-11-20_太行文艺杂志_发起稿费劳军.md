    Taihang Literature and Art Magazine
    Initiates Royalty-Based Support for the Troops

    [Our Newspaper] Taihang Literature and Art Magazine has initiated a royalty-based support for the troops campaign in its Volume 2, Issue 3. In the campaign announcement, the magazine encourages everyone to demonstrate their sacred duty to the patriotic self-defense war and their respect for combat heroes. It also expresses the hope that this patriotic movement will be carried through to the final victory of the self-defense war, demonstrating the warmheartedness of literary and art workers in supporting the troops. The method for supporting the troops is as follows: Authors who are willing to use their royalties to support the troops are requested to indicate "This manuscript's royalties are for supporting the troops" or "X fraction of royalties are for supporting the troops." The magazine will immediately publish the author's name and the amount of support. At the same time, the royalties will be sent to the Political Department of the Military Region. Comrades of the Taihang Literary Federation have taken the lead in setting an example: Comrade Gao Muhong has contributed 1,500 yuan of royalties to support the troops, and Comrades Yu Ming and Gang Fu have each contributed 1,000 yuan. The magazine has already publicly announced the troop support actions of the above individuals and has sent the authors' names and the royalty amounts to the Political Department of the Military Region.
