Ode to the "Special Envoy"
    He Luting

    Why bother with elaborate disguise, "special envoy"?
    Covered in horsehide, still a wolf.
    After all, he's just a chief of staff,
    Speaking insincerely, putting on a show.
    The Chinese people have their own ideas,
    Why the need for a general's tireless efforts?
    Pitiful former chief of staff,
    Unwilling to be a hero, wanting to be a wolf.
    Now the horsehide has been ripped away,
    Quickly lead your wolf pack back home.
    Don't wait for the day of global anger,
    Your ugly name will be forever etched in history.

　　咏“特使”
    贺绿汀
    “特使”何必苦装璜
    蒙上马皮仍是狼
    毕竟是个参谋长
    口是心非做过场
    中国人民有主张
    何必将军日夜忙
    可怜昔日参谋长
    不作英雄愿作狼
    如今马皮已揭光
    快率儿狼返故乡
    莫等全球愤怒日
    青史万古丑名扬
