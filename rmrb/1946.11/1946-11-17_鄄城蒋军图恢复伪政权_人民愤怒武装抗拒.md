From the Frontline Correspondents Group of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region, 14th: After Jiang's direct line 5th Army occupied Juancheng, they actively restored the puppet regime of the Japanese invaders, and used armed forces to protect these regime personnel in order to promote Jiang's "benevolent rule." From the 3rd to the 10th, they dispatched a force of one regiment or more every day to conduct surprise attacks and encirclements on villages along Jiuchengji, 25 miles north of Juancheng, and Dongkou, more than ten miles west, attempting to abduct some people to hold meetings and embellish the Jiang family's image. However, the people were filled with indignation and resisted with arms while relocating, causing Jiang's troops to find every village empty. Enraged, they revealed their true colors, firing and killing at the sight of people, and shelling distant areas. The 9th and 10th were particularly mad and cruel, with the sound of artillery fire resounding more than 40 miles away, forcing the people's armed self-defense struggle to intensify. Under the heroic counterattack of our armed people, the American-equipped Jiang troops had to scurry back to their lairs before 4:00 PM every day.

    鄄城蒋军图恢复伪政权
    人民愤怒武装抗拒
    【本报冀鲁豫前线记者团十四日电】蒋军嫡系第五军侵占我鄄城后，积极恢复日本强盗时代之伪政权。并用武装保卫这些政权人员，以推行蒋家“德政”。从三日至十日，每天以一个团以上的兵力沿鄄城北向廿五里之旧城集及西面十余里之董口一带村庄突击、包围，企图劫持一些群众来召开会议，装点蒋家门面。但人民气愤填膺，一面武装抵抗，一面转移，弄得蒋军村村扑空，恼羞成怒，于是原形毕露，发现人影就大肆射杀，远的就用炮轰。尤以九、十两日为疯狂残忍。炮声响彻四十里以外，迫使人民武装自卫斗争日趋剧烈。在我武装人民英勇反击下，美械装备之蒋军不得不在每天午后四时以前即分头窜回老巢。
