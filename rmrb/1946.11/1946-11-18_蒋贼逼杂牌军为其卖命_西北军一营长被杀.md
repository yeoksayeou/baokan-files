Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 16th: Chiang Kai-shek uses the death penalty to coerce miscellaneous troops into risking their lives for him. The Chiang troops, reorganized from Feng Zhi'an's Northwest Army's 77th Division and other units, entrenched in areas such as Taierzhuang and Zaozhuang, were advancing towards Lanling from Ce Dong at the end of last month, attempting to attack Linyi. In the Battle of Bokou, the 877th and 132nd Brigades were severely attacked by the Eighth Route Army, suffering losses of over 2,500 men. The morale of the officers and soldiers of the division was further weakened, and they hastily retreated, transporting some of the heavy materials to the west bank of the Grand Canal. To suppress their panic and war-weariness, Chiang's senior commanders recently convened a meeting of cadres above the platoon level of the 77th Division. In addition to severely scolding the division for its poor combat performance, they executed the battalion commander of the regiment who lost the battle on the spot.

    西北军一营长被杀
    【新华社山东十六日电】蒋介石以死刑威逼杂牌军为其卖命。盘踞台儿庄枣庄等地山原西北军冯治安部改编之七十七师等部蒋军，于上月底被策东犯兰陵，企图进攻临沂，在博山口一役，八七七及一三二两个旅遭八路军痛击，损兵二千五百余人后，该师官兵战志益挫，乃仓惶收兵，将部分笨重物资运往运河西岸。蒋军高级指挥官为镇压其惶恐厌战情绪，近特召开七十七师排以上的干部会议，除大骂该师作战不力外，当场将这次吃败仗的该团营长枪决。
