    Sharing Grievances and Dividing the Fruits:
    Lin County Focuses on Uniting with Middle Peasants
    [Report from this newspaper] According to a report from the Lin County Joint Office on November 5th: In the mass movement around the autumn harvest, various districts have achieved some success in uniting with middle peasants. Among the 1,041 households that received land and housing in the Eleventh District, 38% were middle peasants. Among the 3,688 households that received materials, 70% were middle peasants. According to statistics from five districts, most of the newly developed peasant association members are middle peasants. In the movement before the autumn harvest, there were many rifts between hired laborers, tenant farmers, poor peasants, and middle peasants in many villages. For example, middle peasants were not allowed to join the peasant association, for fear that they were not firm enough and would cause trouble, or that more people would mean less fruit for themselves. In some villages, such as Jiao Yuan Temple and Liujia Yu, the village cadres shielded landlords, or the landlords used "enlightenment" to deceive the masses, thus leading to struggles against middle peasants. In other villages, because the landlords had already been overthrown, the leadership of the movement did not find an in-depth direction and took some middle peasants as targets of struggle. In the struggle in Nancaisang, it was also discovered that many middle peasants were being struggled against because they took turns serving as Baozhang (local security chief). In some areas, although middle peasants joined the peasant association, their ideological concerns were not resolved, so their attitude was "not seeking merit, but seeking no demerit," and they were not active in struggle or production. Based on this situation, the leadership decided to implement the policy of uniting with middle peasants in the land reform movement before and after the autumn harvest. The experiences gained so far are as follows: First, breaking through the poor peasants' thinking and uniting middle peasants to complain about their grievances: In Shangzhuang Village, the First District, the leadership led poor peasants to analyze landlord Li Xianglin's exploitation account, and found that middle peasants revealed many accounts and lost a lot of good land because of it. It was then discovered that during Chiang Kai-shek's rule, most of the grain taxes were paid by the middle peasants. This revelation led the middle peasants to complain about their suffering. Everyone discussed the different kinds of Baozhang in the past: "Fire-lighting Baozhang, Beaten Baozhang, errand-running Baozhang, pen-holding Baozhang, and matter-managing Baozhang." Then the Baozhang also began to complain about their suffering. Landlord Li Xianglin was isolated, and then the struggle against Li Xianglin was launched, with a total of 120 accounts of blood and sweat being presented. Li Xianglin bowed his head and admitted his mistakes, and gave up land and materials. In this way, the middle and poor peasants truly became of one mind. This approach was a great education for both middle and poor peasants. The middle peasants realized that their past actions that violated the interests of the masses were wrong because of the behavior of the landlords and bullies; the poor peasants also understood that although the middle peasants had done wrong, they were all oppressed people. Second, the leadership encouraged the peasants to calculate their strength. In some villages in the Tenth District, the peasant association asked: "How many people are of one mind with us?" "If the middle peasants all follow the landlords, will the fruits we get be secure?" After concrete calculation, it was discovered that their own strength was very weak, and they realized the need to unite with the middle peasants. Third, the peasant association held heart-to-heart talks to resolve the middle peasants' concerns. In most villages in the Eleventh District, middle peasants expressed their thoughts of "fear of struggle," "not daring to get rich," and "eating, drinking, and wasting" in the talks. The middle and poor peasants explained as they talked, and the ideological barriers gradually disappeared. Fourth, in the distribution of fruits, efforts were made to be universal. Land and houses were distributed in a concentrated manner to ensure that the extremely poor obtained land, and other materials and money were distributed universally. After a middle peasant in Ren Village received 500 yuan, he happily said to the people around him: "No matter how much we get, we are finally one of our own." After the middle peasants received the fruits, their fear immediately disappeared and they united closely with the poor peasants.

    共同诉苦共分果实
    林县抓紧团结中农
    【本报讯】据林县联合办公室十一月五日报导：在秋前后这一段群运中，各区在团结中农上均已获得一些成绩，十一区分得土地房屋的一○四一户中有百分之三十八是中农，分得物资的三六八八户中有百分之七十是中农。五个区的统计新发展的农会会员大部是中农。秋前运动中不少村庄雇、佃、贫农与中农的隔阂很多，如不让中农进农会，怕中农不坚定出乱子，怕人多了自己少分果实等。还有的村庄如焦园寺、六家峪等村，因村干包庇地主或地主以“开明”迷惑群众，因而斗争到中农身上。也有的村庄因地主已斗倒，领导运动没有找到深入的方向，把一些中农当了斗争对象。南采桑斗争中还发现有很多中农因轮流当保长而被斗。有的地区中农虽然进了农会，但由于思想上的顾虑没有解决，因此态度是“不求有功，但求无过”，斗争中生产中均不积极。领导上据此情况决心在秋前后的土地改革运动中贯彻团结中农方针，目前已取得的经验有以下几点：一、打通贫农思想团结中农诉苦：一区上庄村领导贫农分析地主李相林的剥削帐，便发现了中农揭帐很多，并因此失去不少好地，继即发现蒋敌统治期间粮款大部出在中农身上。这一启发，中农便诉开苦了，大家讨论了从前保长有“烧火保长，挨打保长，跑腿保长，和笔杆保长，主事保长”的分别，接着保长也诉开苦了。地主李相林孤立起来，紧接着便开展了对李相林的斗争，共提出血汗帐一百二十件，李相林低头认错，倒出土地物资等。这样一来，中贫农真正成了一心了。这种作法对中贫农都是极大的教育，中农从地主恶霸的行为中认识了自己过去违反群众利益的作法是错误的；贫农也从而谅解了中农虽有过不好，但都是受压迫的人。二、领导上启发农民计算力量。十区有的村庄农会提出：“算算跟咱一心的有多少人？”“如果中农都跟了地主，咱得的果实稳当不稳当？”经具体计算后，乃发现自己力量非常单薄，打通了应团结中农的思想。三、农会座谈心事，给中农解疙瘩。十一区大部村庄中农在座谈中说出了“怕斗争”、“不敢发家”、“吃喝浪费”等思想。中贫农边谈边解释，思想隔阂遂逐渐消除。四、分配果实，力求普遍，地、房集中分，保证赤贫获得土地，其他物款普遍得。任村一个中农分得五百元后，愉快地向旁人说：“不管分多少，咱总算是自己人了。”中农分得果实后，恐惧立即消失而与贫农亲密团结起来。
