    Wen County Mass Movement is Mighty
    Over a Thousand Local Tyrants and Evil Gentry Overthrown Together
    [Report from this newspaper] The high tide of the mass movement in Wen County has passed, and now the work of in-depth consolidation and distribution of the fruits of struggle has begun. This mass movement was relatively large in scale and quickly reached a high tide, resolving 40,000 mu of land within a month. United struggles were implemented in the movement, with middle peasants actively participating, and poor and landless peasants serving as the backbone of the movement, demonstrating resolute and thorough action. At the beginning of the movement, due to the leadership's adoption of a resolute and unreserved approach, the local tyrants and evil gentry were unable to prepare conspiracies and were met with irresistible mass pressure. More than 1,300 local tyrants and evil gentry in the entire county were overthrown together. At the beginning of the struggle, an incident occurred in the Fourth District where Gao Zhao, a local tyrant, used a black gun to kill the chairman of the village peasant association, which immediately aroused the anger of the masses and immediately gave the village's chief culprit a double blow. In the later stages of the movement, some villages turned to anti-espionage and anti-political banditry. This was a pursuit after the thorough liquidation of the local tyrants and evil gentry, with village militias going to other counties to capture fugitive bullies and bandits for thorough liquidation. The shortcoming of the movement was that although it won over the participation of middle peasants and strengthened the momentum of the movement, many middle peasants participated in the movement out of fear of being struggled against. In the later stages of the movement, some cadres did not grasp the policies tightly, causing fear and anxiety among the middle peasants, and the "face-washing and charcoal-smearing" movement could not be carried out smoothly. Now, the county movement has begun to distribute land and carry out in-depth consolidation work based on this situation, strengthen peasant unity, rectify the armed forces, and begin preparing to organize production. Summarizing the county's movement, the following points of experience have been gained: 1. At the beginning of the movement, the government did its best to support the masses, and the masses were in high spirits, unanimously demanding to fight through and thoroughly turn over. 2. Self-criticism from top to bottom: the county criticized the districts, the districts criticized the villages, and the village cadres criticized the masses. This was a major review of the past and strengthened the connection between the leadership and the masses. 3. Calculating the turn-over account was done from two aspects: on the one hand, whether the local tyrants and evil gentry were thoroughly struggled against, and on the other hand, whether the body was thoroughly turned over, thereby mobilizing the masses. Poor people who had neither rented land nor revealed money also turned over by calculating old accounts and calculating the village's total accounts. 4. United struggle: focusing on the local bullies and landlords that everyone hated, united in collusion, the struggle was powerful, which could resolve sectarian contradictions, and the scope of the initial launch was very broad, and the masses were not tired. 5. Adopted mass thorough investigation, flag insertion, and document delivery, etc. for the land of local tyrants and evil gentry.

    温县群运声势浩大
    千余奸霸一齐斗倒
    【本报讯】温县群运高潮已过，现已开始深入巩固工作并分配斗争果实。这次群运规模较大，很快便走向高潮，一月内即解决土地四万亩。运动中实行了联合斗争，中贫农都积极参加，贫雇农更是运动的骨干，表现得坚决彻底。运动一开始，由于领导上采取了坚决放手的方针，奸霸地主未及准备阴谋，即遭到不可抗拒的群众压力，全县一千三百多奸霸一齐斗倒。斗争开始四区发生了高照事件，奸霸黑枪打死该村农会主席，当即激起群众的愤怒，立即给该村主谋凶犯以双倍的打击。运动的后期有些村庄即转入反特务与反政治土匪。这是给奸霸地主以彻底清算之后的追击，各村民兵到外县去捉逃亡的恶霸、土匪，以进行彻底清算。运动中的缺点是虽争取了中农参加，壮大了运动的声势。但中农参加运动多是怕斗到自己，运动后期有些干部对政策掌握不紧引起中农的恐惧不安，洗脸擦黑运动也不能顺利开展。现该县运动已根据这一情形，开始分配土地及深入巩固工作，加强农民团结，整顿武装，开始准备组织生产；总结该县运动，取得以下几点经验：一、运动一开始，政权即尽力为群众撑腰，群众情绪都很高，一致要求斗透，彻底翻身。二、自上而下的自我批评：县对区、区对村、村干部对群众展开了自我批评，这是对过去的一个大检查，密切了领导与群众的联系。三、算翻身帐从两方面算：一面是对奸霸地主斗透了没有？一面是身翻透了没有？从而调动群众。既无租地又无揭钱的穷人也从算老帐与算村子总帐得到翻身。四、联合斗争：以人人痛恨的恶霸地主为中心，联合串通，斗争声势大，可以解除宗派矛盾，一下发动的面很广，群众也不疲劳。五、对恶霸地主土地采取群众性彻底清查、插牌、交文书等。
