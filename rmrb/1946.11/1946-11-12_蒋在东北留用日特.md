Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th. According to a Shanghai newspaper report on October 22nd, Chiang Kai-shek still retains Japanese special agents in Northeast China. A Japanese female war criminal in Changchun told reporters that her husband, Kobayashi, was the head of the so-called "Japanese National Essence Group" that once caused a sensation in Changchun. He has been sent by the Kuomintang Northeast Security Headquarters to Fanjiatun to train special agents. These special agents include Japanese and Chinese, and are outwardly known as the "Volunteer Army." It is claimed that this Japanese special agent leader has also formed a special agent organization called the "Patriotic Blood Alliance," colluding with the Kuomintang reactionaries to harm the people of Northeast China.
