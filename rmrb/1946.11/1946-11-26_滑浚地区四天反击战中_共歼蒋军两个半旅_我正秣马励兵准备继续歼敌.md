[This report from the Jilu豫 (Hebei-Shandong-Henan) Frontline on the 23rd] While Chiang Kai-shek is publicly announcing his so-called ceasefire order, he has also ordered his troops to continue their active attacks on our liberated areas. In the past ten days, the 41st and 47th Divisions of Sun’s 5th Pacification Zone of the Zhengzhou Pacification Headquarters, and the Hebei Security Forces, have advanced into our Huaxian and Junxian areas, successively capturing Baidaokou, Shangguan Village, Liuguji (in Huaxian, located about 70 li southwest of Puyang), Shaoerzhai, Lao'anzhen, Huangzhuang, Zhulou, Hancun (in Huaxian, located about 80 li south of Puyang), and other places. Since November 15th, they have continuously harassed Mudan Street (about 40 li west of Puyang), Sijianfang (about 50 li southwest of Puyang), Liangmenzhen, Haitongji (about 60 li south of Puyang), and other places, attempting to seize our Puyang city.

The military and civilians of our liberated areas rose up in self-defense, launching a counterattack against the invading Chiang troops on the 19th of this month. After four days of fighting on the 19th, 20th, 21st, and 22nd, all the Chiang troops entering the aforementioned areas were annihilated. It is estimated that over 3,000 Chiang officers and soldiers, including Huang Boliang, the commander of the 311th Regiment, were killed or wounded. 8,000 Chiang officers and soldiers were captured, including Yang Xianming, the Brigade Commander (originally Divisional Commander) of the 104th Brigade (formerly division), Deputy Brigade Commander Li Keyuan, Gou Zaihua, the commander of the 312th Regiment, Chen Xiaowen, the commander of the 374th Regiment, and He Guansan, the commander of the 12th Security Corps of Hebei (previously mistakenly identified as a column). In total, over 11,000 Chiang officers and soldiers were killed or captured. This included the entire 104th Brigade, most of the 125th Brigade, and the entire 12th Security Corps of Hebei. A total of five mountain guns, four anti-tank guns, thirty-five mortars, over three hundred light and heavy machine guns, over five thousand rifles, and five vehicles were seized. Also captured was a secret order of attack issued by Chiang Kai-shek simultaneously with the so-called ceasefire order, and many other military supplies.

Over a hundred strongholds, large and small, east of Huaxian and north of Changyuan, including Denggang, Malanji, Niumiao Temple, Xuying, Shangguan Village, Shaoerzhai, Zhulou, Hancun, etc., have been recovered. The area of eighty li, which had been occupied by the enemy, has been regained by us. While the above-mentioned Chiang troops were being counterattacked and annihilated by us, the 5th Army of Wang Jingjiu in western Shandong and the 85th Division of Wang Zhonglian in northern Henan actively reinforced them, attempting to save the enemy from destruction, but reinforcements from afar could not quench the immediate thirst, and they could not escape the tragic end of defeat. Now our military and civilians are sharpening their swords and preparing to continue annihilating the invading Chiang troops on a large scale.

　　滑浚地区四天反击战中
    共歼蒋军两个半旅
    我正秣马励兵准备继续歼敌
    【本报冀鲁豫前线二十三日电】蒋介石正在公开宣布所谓停战令之同时，复命令他的军队继续积极进攻我解放区，旬日以来，其郑州绥署孙第五绥区之四十一师、四十七师与河北保安部队，进占我滑县、浚县地区，除先后陷我白道口、上官村、留固集（滑县境，位于濮阳西南约七十里）、邵耳砦、老岸镇、黄庄、朱楼、韩村（滑县境，位于濮阳南约八十里）等地外，又于十一月十五日以后，不断向我牡丹街（濮阳西约四十里）、四间房（濮阳西南约五十里）两门镇、海通集（濮阳南约六十里）等地窜扰，并企图进占我濮阳城。我解放区军民奋起自卫，于本月十九日开始与进犯蒋军展开反击战，经十九、二十、二十一、二十二四日的战斗，当将进入上述各地蒋军全部歼灭，计毙伤蒋军官兵三一一团团长黄伯亮以下三千余人，俘虏蒋军一○四旅（原师）旅长（原师长）杨显明、副旅长李克源三一二团团长苟在华、三七四团团长陈晓文、河北第十二保安总队（前误为纵队），总队长何冠三以下官兵八千余人，共计毙俘蒋军官兵达一万一千余人。其中包括一○四旅全部，一二五旅大部，河北第十二保安总队全部。共计缴获山炮五门、反坦克炮四门、迫击炮三十五门、轻重机枪三百余挺、步枪五千余支、汽车五辆。蒋介石与所谓停战令同时发出之进攻密令一份，其他军用品甚多。收复滑县以东、长垣以北之邓岗、马兰集、泥马庙、徐营、上官村、邵耳砦、朱楼、韩村等大小据点百余处，被敌进占之纵横八十里地区，已重新为我收复。当上述蒋军正在遭我反击歼灭之际，鲁西王敬久之第五军与豫北王仲廉之八十五师，虽然积极增援，企图挽救该敌之毁灭，但远水难解近渴，仍不能免于惨败之结局，现我军民正在秣马励兵，以待准备继续大量歼灭进犯之蒋军。
