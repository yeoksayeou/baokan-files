　　Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang (Continued)
    A Folk Revolutionary Historical Story from the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region

    3. The Red Flag is Planted at Dead Sheep Bay

　　The captain's whistle blows shrilly,
　　Everyone is busy, guns slung and mounting horses.
　　Hearing that Wang Gui is suffering torture,
　　Orders are passed in the middle of the night:
　　"Wang Gui is our good comrade,
　　We can't let him lose his life, no matter what."

　　Twenty cavalrymen ride in the lead,
　　Militia and Young Pioneers follow closely.
　　Horseshoes clatter on the ground,
　　Long guns, short guns, red-tasseled spears.
　　People are spirited, horses are energetic,
　　Gunfire erupts at the break of dawn.

　　A white turnip with a single root,
　　Villagers and guerrillas are of one mind.
　　Hearing the gunfire, they all take action,
　　With kitchen knives, shotguns, and dog-beating sticks.
　　Working together from inside and out,
　　Dead Sheep Bay is turned upside down.

　　Guns firing, chickens and dogs barking wildly,
　　The guerrillas storm into Dead Sheep Bay.
　　Old Man Cui is fast asleep on his kang,
　　Hearing the gunfire, he jumps up.
　　Having satisfied himself by beating Wang Gui,
　　He's enjoying a cigarette.

　　Yellow brass lamp with a glass shade,
　　A silver tobacco pouch cannot soothe his anxiety.
　　Two or three concubines,
　　But none as good as Xiangxiang!
　　A chunk of fatty mutton falls into a dog's mouth,
　　It's snatched away before it can be tasted.
　　Wang Gui won't live this time,
　　Little Xiangxiang will be mine.

　　The more he thinks, the sweeter it gets, like sugar,
　　Saliva drips onto his chin.
　　He dreams a dream by the lamp,
　　Holding Xiangxiang in his arms.
　　A sweet and sour dream that doesn't last long,
　　"Crack," "Crack," the sound of gunfire.
　　The first shot wakes him up,
　　The second shot makes him jump off the kang.
　　He hurriedly calls his lackeys:
　　"Close the gate and get on the roof!"
　　"Attack wherever they come from;
　　I'll reward each of you with ten silver dollars."

　　With more men and heavier gunfire, it's different,
　　Old Man Cui changes his mind—
　　Before the sun rises, the sky is bright,
　　Old Man Cui slips out the back door.

　　The sun rises, and the day is bright,
　　The red flag is planted on the ridge.
　　The sun rises like a flower,
　　The guerrillas are one family with us poor folks.
　　Steaming rice porridge and hot steamed buns,
　　Treating our guerrillas with the best food and drink.

　　Wang Gui is rescued and the ropes untied,
　　The guerrillas all have tears in their eyes.
　　Wang Gui is in so much pain that he faints,
　　Xiangxiang cries out: "Brother!
　　If you die, I won't live either,
　　Open your eyes and look at me."

　　4. Free Marriage

　　The sun rises, the sky is red,
　　The revolution has brought a good life.
　　When Old Man Cui was here, it was like the darkest days,
　　Nine out of ten families had nothing to eat or wear.
　　The poor have stood up and driven away Old Man Cui,
　　Dead Sheep Bay has become Live Sheep Bay.

　　A lamp without oil gives no light,
　　A peasant without land is like a lamp without oil.
　　With land, the lamp flower shines brightly,
　　Everyone's face glows red.
　　A mouthful of bitter herbs, a mouthful of sugar,
　　Wang Gui marries Li Xiangxiang.

　　Men and women are free and equal,
　　Free marriage is the new way.
　　Tang Seng went through seventy-two caves to get the scriptures,
　　Wang Gui and Xiangxiang suffered countless torments.
　　Through all the hardships, their hearts never changed,
　　Hardship-sharing couples are truly sweet.

　　A beautiful bird chirps as it enters its nest,
　　Xiangxiang enters the bridal chamber with tears streaming down.
　　A spring gushing water without end,
　　Soaking Wang Gui's new cloth shirt.
　　"I've been waiting for the rooster to crow all night,
　　This day has been a long time coming!"
　　Xiangxiang wants to cry and laugh,
　　She doesn't know what to say.

　　Wang Gui laughs, speechless,
　　Looking at Xiangxiang, he still yearns for her!
　　He clasps Xiangxiang's hands in his,
　　Difficult to speak, difficult to laugh, difficult to open his mouth:
　　"If it weren't for the revolution, the poor wouldn't be able to stand up,
　　If it weren't for the revolution, we wouldn't be able to get married!
　　The revolution saved you and me,
　　The revolution saved us villagers.

　　Everyone must carry the red flag,
　　If the red flag falls, everyone will suffer!
　　Get ready to go on the road, plow the fields,
　　Making revolution is our own business.
　　It rains from the sky, the ground is slippery,
　　If you fall, pick yourself up.

　　The sun rises, a surge of red,
　　I plan to make revolution for the long term."
　　Three days after entering the door, they settled down,
　　He signed up for the guerrillas.
　　A sheepskin towel wrapped around his head,
　　A smokeless steel gun slung over his shoulder.
　　When he's free for ten days or half a month,
　　He asks for leave to come back and see Xiangxiang.
　　After seeing Xiangxiang, he returns to the team,
　　Xiangxiang sees him off to the bottom of the valley.

　　There's plenty of yellow clay in the valley,
　　Let's dig up some clay and mold two of us.
　　Mold one of you and mold one of me,
　　Mold them like living people.
　　Break the clay figures and bring them back to life,
　　Mold one of you again and mold one of me again.

　　The older brother has the younger sister on him,
　　The younger sister also has the older brother on her.
　　After molding the clay figures, she calls out: "Brother,
　　Wait a few more days for you to come see me."

　　Part Three
　　1. Old Man Cui Returns Again

　　Heavy rain under a clear sky,
　　A chicken feather letter brings bad news.
　　Holding the chicken feather letter, running breathlessly,
　　The oppressive White Army is coming again!
　　The guerrillas marched to the rear of the White Army that night,
　　Orders from above to fight a guerrilla war.

　　Blowing the whistle and carrying the gun,
　　Wang Gui didn't have time to see Xiangxiang.
　　Dead Sheep hears the news in the dark,
　　The next day at dawn, the White Army entered the village.
　　The White Army all have gloomy faces,
　　As if everyone owes them two hundred coins.
　　They check at this house and ask at that house:
　　"Which family has someone following the Red Army?"
　　"Which family has divided cattle and sheep?
　　Which family has divided land and houses?"

　　Niu Siwa divided a cave dwelling,
　　After questioning him two or three times, it was found out.
　　Old Man Cui's gate is wide and tall,
　　He was hoisted up by two hemp ropes.
　　Two bundles of thorny branches,
　　His whole body was beaten into shreds.

　　The White Army's company commander, a devil without a head,
　　Starts to grin again:
　　"You can't draw clear water from a dry well,
　　You are born with the bones of the poor, yet you want to make easy money!
　　"The King of Hell told me to be a poor man,
　　Yet you still want to turn yourself over, crookedly.
　　"Relying on your Red Army fathers' great power,
　　A dung beetle still wants to push Mount Tai!
　　"Hand over what you divided quickly,
　　Your Red Army fathers can't be relied on anymore."

　　Ropes are used to bind them, bayonets are used to force them,
　　Old Man Cui's things must all be returned.
　　Lackeys clear the way, wolves follow behind,
　　Old Man Cui returns to Dead Sheep Bay.

　　王贵与李香香（续）
    陕甘宁边区民间革命历史故事
    李季
    ３  红旗插到死羊湾
    队长的哨子呼呼响，
    挂枪上马人人忙。
    听说王贵受苦刑，
    半夜三更传命令：
    “王贵是咱好同志，
    再怎么也不能叫他把命送。”
    二十匹马队前边走，
    赤卫军、少先队紧跟上。
    马蹄落地嚓嚓响，
    长枪、短枪、红缨枪。
    人有精神马有劲，
    麻麻亮时开了枪。
    白生生的蔓菁一条根，
    庄户人和游击队是一条心。
    听见枪响齐下手，
    菜刀、鸟枪、打狗棍。
    里应外合一起干，
    死羊湾闹的翻了天。
    枪声乱响鸡狗乱叫唤，
    游击队打进了死羊湾。
    崔二爷当炕上睡大觉，
    听见枪响往起跳。
    打罢王贵发了瘾，
    洋烟抽的正起劲。
    黄铜烟灯玻璃罩，
    银铙的烟葫芦不能解心焦。
    大小老婆两三个，
    那个也没有香香好！
    肥羊肉掉在狗嘴里头，
    三抢两抢夺不到手。
    王贵这一回再也活不了，
    小香香就成我的了。
    越想越甜赛沙糖，
    涎水流在下巴上。
    烟灯旁边做了一个梦，
    把香香抱在怀当中。
    又酸又甜好梦做不长，
    “噼啪”“噼啪”枪声响。
    头一枪惊醒坐起来，
    第二枪响时跳下炕。
    连忙叫起狗腿子：
    “关着大门快上房！”
    那边过来那边打；
    一人赏你们十块响洋。”
    人马多枪声稠不一样，
    二爷心里改了主张——
    太阳没出满天韶，
    崔二爷从后门溜跑了。
    太阳出来天大亮，
    红旗插在岭畔上。
    太阳出来一朵花，
    游击队和咱穷汉们是一家。
    滚滚的米汤热腾腾的馍，
    招待咱游击队好吃喝。
    救上王贵松开了绳，
    游击队的同志们个个眼圈红。
    把王贵痛的直昏过，
    香香哭着叫：“哥哥！
    “你要死了我也不得活，
    睁一睁眼睛看一看我。”
    ４  自由结婚
    太阳出来满天红，
    革命带来了好光景。
    崔二爷在时就像大黑天，
    十有九家没吃穿。
    穷人翻身赶跑崔二爷，
    死羊湾变成活羊湾。
    灯盏里没油灯不明，
    庄户人没地种就像没油的灯。
    有了土地灯花亮，
    人人脸上发红光。
    吃一嘴黄莲吃一嘴糖，
    王贵娶了李香香。
    男女自由都平等，
    自由结婚新时样。
    唐僧取经过了七十二个洞，
    王贵和香香受的折磨数不清。
    千难万难心不变，
    患难夫妻实在甜。
    俊鸟投窝叫喳喳，
    香香进洞房泪如麻。
    清泉里湎水水不断，
    滴湿了王贵的新布衫。
    “半夜里就等着公鸡叫，
    瞧这个日子把人盼死了！”
    香香想哭又想笑，
    不知道怎么说着好。
    王贵笑的说不出来话，
    看着香香还想她！
    双双拉着香香的手，
    难说难笑难开口：
    “不是闹革命穷人翻不了身，
    不是闹革命咱俩也结不了婚！
    “革命救了你和我，
    革命救了咱们庄户人。
    “一杆红旗要大家扛，
    红旗倒了大家都遭殃！
    “快马上路牛耕地，
    闹革命是咱们自己的事。
    “天上下雨地下滑，
    自己跌倒自己爬。
    “太阳出来一股劲的红，
    我打算长远闹革命。”
    过门三天安了家，
    游击队上报名啦。
    羊肚子毛巾缠头上，
    肩膀上背着无烟钢。
    十天半月有空了，
    请假回来看香香。
    看罢香香归队去，
    香香送到底里。
    沟湾里胶泥黄又多，
    挖块胶泥捏咱两个。
    捏一个你来捏一个我，
    捏的就像活人托。
    捏碎了泥人再重活，
    再捏一个你来再捏一个我。
    哥哥身上有妹妹，
    妹妹身上也有哥哥。
    捏完了泥人叫：“哥哥，
    再等几天你来看我。”
    第三部
    １  崔二爷又回来了
    大红晴天下猛雨，
    鸡毛信传来了坏消息。
    拿着鸡毛信不住气的跑，
    压迫人的白军又来了！
    游击队连夜开到白军屁股后边去，
    上级命令去打游击。
    吹起哨子背起枪，
    王贵没顾上去看香香。
    死羊黑里听到信，
    第二天大清早，白军可进了村。
    白军个个黑丧着脸，
    就好像人人都短他们二百钱。
    东家查来西家问：
    “谁家有人随了红军？”
    “谁家分了牛和羊？
    谁家分地又分房？”
    牛四娃分了一孔窑，
    三查两问查出来了。
    崔二爷的大门宽又高，
    两根麻绳吊起了。
    两把荆条一把剌，
    混身打成肉丝丝。
    白军连长没头鬼，
    又着手来裂着嘴：
    “干井里打不起清水来，
    天生的穷骨头想发便宜财！
    “阎王爷叫我当穷汉，
    斜头歪脑还想把身翻。
    “仗着你红军老子势力大，
    粪爬牛（注：即屎壳郎）还想推泰山！
    “分的东西赶快往出交，
    你们的红军老子靠不着了。”
    绳子捆来刺刀逼，
    崔二爷的东西都要回去。
    狗腿子开路，狼跟在后边，
    崔二爷又回到死羊湾。
              （本节未完）
