Xinhua News Agency, Jiluyu Front, 16th: (Delayed) Yesterday, this reporter visited a military spokesperson of the Jiluyu Front Command and inquired about the current Jiluyu war situation. The spokesperson shared the following views. The spokesperson first described the troop strength calculations and changes of Chiang Kai-shek's troops attacking the Jiluyu Border Region over the past three months, stating: The Chiang Kai-shek troops attacking our Jiluyu Liberated Area include the six brigades of the 68th Division (original army) and the 55th Division (original army) of Liu Ruming's Fourth Pacification Zone, Zhang Lanfeng's column, and the two brigades of Zhao Xitian's reorganized 3rd Division (original 10th Army) subsequently added. Also, the five brigades of the 41st Division (original army) and 47th Division (original army) of Sun Zhen's Fifth Pacification Zone, the two divisions (equal to brigades) of Qiu Qingquan's Fifth Army of Wang Jingjiu's group, the three brigades of Hu Lian's reorganized 11th Division, the two brigades of Fang Xianjue's 88th Division (original army), and the two brigades of Shen Chengnian's 75th Division (original army), excluding local security forces, totaled twenty-two brigades and one provisional column. Over the past three months, under our army's self-defense counterattacks, the Chiang Kai-shek troops annihilated by our army, excluding local security teams, include the annihilation of more than two brigades of the Fourth Pacification Zone in the Longhai Campaign, the annihilation of two brigades of the reorganized 3rd Division and more than two brigades of the Fifth Pacification Zone in Dingtao and Caoxian. Subsequently, approximately half a brigade of the same pacification zone was annihilated west of Puyang. Half a brigade of Wang Jingjiu's reorganized 11th Division was annihilated southwest of Juye. One and a half brigades of Liu Ruming's Fourth Pacification Zone were annihilated south of Juancheng. A total of nine brigades of the invading Chiang Kai-shek troops have been annihilated. From the above figures, it is clear that none of the four divisions—the 68th, 57th, 41st, and 47th—and one column of the Fourth and Fifth Pacification Zones' offensive forces are complete divisions. The reorganized 3rd Division transferred by Chiang Kai-shek was annihilated, and part of the reorganized 11th Division was also annihilated by us. The remaining forces capable of fighting include six and a half brigades of Wang Jingjiu's group (this is the main force), and the Liu Ruming group of the Fourth Pacification Zone, with only two brigades and one column, and the Sun Zhen group of the Fifth Pacification Zone, with only two and a half brigades. At most, there are currently no more than thirteen brigades and one column.

The military spokesperson then described the distribution of the current thirteen brigades and one column of Chiang Kai-shek's troops. He said: The two brigades of Wang Jingjiu's 88th Division have consistently been stationed in the Huxi area of Dangshan, north of Longhai, and are being dragged down by our local armed forces. Cao Fulian's 55th Division of the Fourth Pacification Zone, with less than a brigade remaining, along with Zhang Lanfeng's column and Liu Ruzhen's 68th Division, with one brigade remaining, must be responsible for guarding the strongholds along the Longhai line, including Dongming, Kaocheng, and south of Heze, as well as maintaining transportation and countering our guerrilla warfare. The two and a half brigades and remnants of Sun Zhen's Fifth Pacification Zone, in addition to guarding Changyuan and Fengqiu, are mostly scattered in the Hua (County) and Jun (County) areas. Only Wang Jingjiu's Fifth Army, the 18th Army's reorganized 11th Division, and the reorganized 75th Division, totaling 60,000, still need to allocate troops to guard Jiaxiang and Juancheng. At this point, the military spokesperson further analyzed the current situation of Chiang Kai-shek's troops in Jiluyu, stating: Chiang Kai-shek's offensive against our Jiluyu is in a dilemma. Continuing to advance will result in insufficient troops, low morale, and a decreasing chance of victory. If some troops are transferred from the defensive forces to the offensive forces, it will only further facilitate the development of our guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines. The recent development of the people's forces in eastern Henan is clear evidence of this. The further Chiang Kai-shek's troops advance, the more empty the rear becomes, the more inadequate the defensive forces feel, and the more likely transportation will be cut off. Moreover, the further they advance into the interior of the liberated area, the more they will encounter the strong resistance of our liberated area's people, and the more they will feel the danger of our annihilation strikes. The rapid and decisive victory in the Juancheng annihilation battle demonstrates that the support of the masses should be taken into account. Even if the enemy stops advancing, they will still be annihilated within the liberated area. Therefore, it is not surprising that Wang Jingjiu's six and a half brigades, after advancing to Yun (City) and Ju (Ye), and the remnants of Sun Zhen's Fifth Pacification Zone, after advancing to Hua (County) and Jun (County), are as cautious as turtles.

As for ourselves, as pointed out in the Liberation Daily editorial, we are growing stronger with each battle, our morale is consistently high, our ideological education and the work of strict organization and discipline have recently made great progress, and our combat experience is becoming richer with each battle. In the Battle of Juancheng, we only had a portion of our troops participate, yet we resolved the battle so quickly and decisively. It is not that the enemy cannot fight, but that our combat power has been greatly strengthened. Guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines has been further developed, and the people are taking up arms to fight for the protection of the benefits of "land to the tiller." As long as we can continue to persevere, the Chiang Kai-shek troops invading our liberated area will further experience the taste of difficult transportation, cut-off supplies, encirclement, and eventual annihilation!

　　冀鲁豫前线军事发言人谈
    蒋军已陷进退两难
    三月来被歼九旅后备枯竭士气大馁我方愈战愈强进犯者终必全被歼灭
    【新华社冀鲁豫前线十六日电】（迟到）记者昨访冀鲁豫前线指挥部某军事发言人，询以目前冀鲁豫战局，承发表如下意见。发言人首先述及进攻冀鲁豫边区的蒋军三个月来兵力计算及其消长情形称：进攻我冀鲁豫解放区之蒋军，包括原来刘汝明第四绥靖区之六十八师（原军）、五十五师（原军）六个旅，张岚峰的纵队，及后来陆续增加上来的赵锡田整三师（原第十军）两个旅，孙震之第五绥靖区之四十一师（原军）、四十七师（原军）五个旅，王敬久集团之邱清泉第五军之两个师（等于旅），胡琏之整十一师之三个旅，方先觉之八十八师（原军）两个旅，及沈澄年之七十五师（原军）两个旅，除地方保安队外，总兵力共达二十二个旅和一个暂编纵队。三个月以来，上述蒋军在我军自卫反击下，被我军歼灭的除地方保安团队外，计陇海战役歼灭了第四绥靖区两个多旅，定陶、曹县歼灭了整三师两个旅，及第五绥靖区两个多旅，接着该绥靖区又在濮阳以西被我歼灭约半个旅，王敬久之整十一师在巨野西南被我歼灭半个旅，刘汝明第四绥靖区在鄄城以南又被我歼灭一个半旅，进犯蒋军前后被我歼灭的共达九个旅。从上面数字中告诉我们，第四、第五两绥靖区的进攻部队六十八、五十七、四十一、四十七四个师和一个纵队全没有一个完整的师了。蒋介石从别处调来的整三师被歼灭了，整十一师亦被我歼灭一部，剩下能够作战的有王敬久集团之六个半旅（这是主力），勉强能作战的第四绥靖区刘汝明集团只有两个旅和一个纵队，及第五绥靖区孙震集团只有两个半旅，充其量目前共计不超过十三个旅和一个纵队。
    军事发言人继述及现在蒋军的十三个旅和一个纵队的分布状况，他说：王敬久之八十八师两个旅始终在陇海砀山及其以北之湖西一带守备，被我地方武装拖着。四绥靖区曹福林之五十五师残部尚不足一个旅，与张岚峰纵队、刘汝珍之六十八师残部一个旅，则须担任陇海沿线东明、考城、荷泽以南等据点的守备，和维护交通，以及对付我之游击战争。孙震第五绥靖区之两个半旅及残部，除守备长垣、封邱外，大部已分散于滑（县）浚（县）地区，只有王敬久之第五军、第十八军整十一师、整七十五师共计六万，但还需抽兵担任嘉祥及鄄城之守备。至此，军事发言人进一步分析目前蒋军在冀鲁豫的处境称：蒋军对我冀鲁豫的进攻，正处在一个进退两难的境地。继续前进，则兵力不足，士气已馁，愈战愈没有胜利的把握。如从守备部队中抽调一些上来作进攻部队，那只有更加便利于我敌后游击战争的开展。最近豫东人民力量之发展，就是明证。蒋军愈前进，后方愈空虚，守备兵力愈感不足，交通愈要被截断。而且愈前进愈深入解放区腹地，愈遭到我解放区人民的坚强反击，愈感到我歼灭打击的危险。鄄城歼灭战如此迅速干脆，群众条件是应该估计上去的。敌人即停止不进，亦将同样被歼灭在解放区以内。所以，王敬久之六个半旅进到郓（城）巨（野）后，和孙震五绥靖区之残部进至滑（县）浚（县）后，更像乌龟那样小心谨慎，这是不足为奇的。
    至于我们自己方面，正如解放日报社论所指出的，我们是愈战愈强，我们的士气始终是高涨的，我们的思想教育与严肃组织与纪律的工作最近已大有进步，作战经验是一次一次的愈益丰富，鄄城之战，我们仅是部分的队伍参加，竟如此神速的解决战斗，敌人不是不能战，而是我们的战斗力益更大大的加强了。敌后的游击战已有进一步的开展，人民正在拿起武器为保卫耕者有其田的利益而战，只要我们能够继续坚持下去，侵入到我解放区的蒋军定会进一步的尝到交通困难，供应断绝，前后围击和最后歼灭的滋味的！
