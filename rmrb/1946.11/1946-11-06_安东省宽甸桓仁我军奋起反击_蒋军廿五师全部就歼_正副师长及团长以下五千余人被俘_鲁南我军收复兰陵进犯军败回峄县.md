Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, Urgent Telegram at 11:00 AM on the 3rd: After the Chiang army violated the agreement and occupied Andong, they continued to aggressively invade our Kuandian and Huanren areas. Our army, having reached the limit of its tolerance, rose up to resist and annihilated the entire 25th Division of the Chiang army, capturing the enemy commander, deputy commander, and more than 5,000 soldiers below the regimental commander. We are currently continuing to expand our victories. Further details will be reported later.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 3rd: The Eighth Route Army in Southern Shandong recovered Lanling (more than 20 kilometers east of Yixian) on the 31st of last month. After suffering heavy losses, the invading Chiang army retreated to Yixian. The main force of the Chiang army's 77th Division (military reorganized), attempting to invade Linyi from Zaozhuang and Yixian, occupied Lanling on the 29th. The 109th and 110th Regiments of its 37th Brigade then invaded the Xiaokou position, more than 20 miles northwest of Lanling, on the morning of the next day. The Eighth Route Army resisted stubbornly and launched a full-scale counterattack at 10:00 AM that morning. The brigade was caught in a crossfire and suffered heavy casualties. The remaining troops, under the cover of nine tanks, fled towards Yixian. The Eighth Route Army took advantage of the victory and recovered Lanling on the 31st. In this battle, three 60mm mortars, two heavy mortars, and two light and heavy machine guns were captured. Other battle results are still being tallied. On the same day, another unit of the Eighth Route Army also repelled the Chiang army's 26th Division (military reorganized) which invaded Shuiguoji (more than 10 kilometers east of Zaozhuang) from the east of Zaozhuang.
