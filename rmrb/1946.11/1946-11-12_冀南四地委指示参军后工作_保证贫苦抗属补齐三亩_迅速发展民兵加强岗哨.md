    [Our newspaper, Weixian, 8th dispatch] The Jinnan Fourth Military Subdistrict's enlistment campaign is drawing to a close. The Fourth Prefectural Committee has specifically instructed all counties to quickly and firmly grasp various follow-up tasks. (1) In general areas, it should be guaranteed that impoverished families of revolutionary soldiers receive a supplement of three mu of land per person. In areas with more land, if there is still land remaining after supplementing to three mu, it can be supplemented to four mu. The expenses for clothing and travel expenses for seeing off new soldiers can be resolved through donations and should not be apportioned based on land burden. After the new soldiers leave, assistance should be provided to their families in formulating household plans and guiding them in winter production, such as textile production. (2) Restore and reorganize organizations. In villages where militiamen have enlisted, the militia should be rapidly developed to control the village's armed forces, and women and children should be mobilized to stand guard and keep watch to strictly prevent special agents from sabotage. In villages where village cadres have led enlistment, village-level organizations should be quickly strengthened, the morale of young people should be stabilized, and production should be actively pursued.

    【本报威县八日电】冀南四分区参军运动即将结束，四地委特指示各县迅速抓紧进行各种善后工作。（一）一般地区，应保证贫苦抗属每人补齐三亩地。地多的地区，补齐三亩后仍有剩余土地者，可以补齐四亩。欢送新战士时所花费的衣服、路费等，可募捐解决，不能按负担地摊派。新战士走后，应帮助其家属制订按家计划，领导进行冬季生产，如纺织等。（二）恢复与整理组织。民兵参军走了的村，应迅速发展民兵，掌握村的武装，并发动妇女儿童站岗放哨，严防特务捣乱。村干带领参军的村，要迅速健全村级组织，稳定青年情绪，积极生产。
