　　Unfair Fruit Distribution Discovered in Tunliu
　　I. Abuse and misuse, not distributed to the masses
　　II. Unclear concept of who should be distributed to
　　[Our newspaper Yangcheng 13th dispatch] During various turn-over conferences since October 18th in Tunliu's mass movement, after mass reflection and cadre introspection, many problems were discovered in the process of fruit distribution, affecting the thorough realization of "land to the tiller."
　　(1) Misappropriation of fruits, not distributed to the masses. According to comrades working in the Third District, the government ordered that a portion of the fruits be retained to cover expenses for running private primary schools and village public expenses. The Military Committee notified that a portion should be retained to buy guns for the militia. Village cadres themselves called for retaining a portion to start cooperatives. The inspection revealed that nineteen villages had a total of 3,800 *shi* of grain from the retained fruits. If houses and land are included, the number would be even greater.
　　(2) Abuse and misuse were found in the preservation of fruits. For example, the Old Junzhuang Farmers' Association stored a large number of fruits in the Farmers' Association without distributing them, assigning militiamen to guard them every day. Today they say this is missing, tomorrow they say that is short, and they postpone accounting when the masses ask. A few cadres sold decent items first without consulting the masses; some Farmers' Association cadres invested in production everywhere, and people don't know where the money came from, and there is a lot of discussion among the masses. In Xiawang Village, Fourth District, six operas were performed in half a year, using 117 *shi* of fruit grain, and another 5 *shi* of rice was used to repair the stage, not counting the big eating and drinking. Cadres in × village in × district took the fruits to start a cooperative and established a military reception station, and as a result, they ate and drank heavily in it all day long.
　　(3) Unfair distribution. In Su Village, Wazi, and Chapeng Villages in the Third District, there is the so-called "three unfairnesses," that is, poor peasants and those with more problems in the struggle ended up with less, while those with no or fewer problems ended up with more, which is called unfair "calculation." The fruit distribution was not fully agreed upon by the peasants. Those who did not need courtyards were forcibly given courtyards, those who wanted livestock could not get them, and those who had livestock were given livestock, which is called unfair "distribution." Some things were scarce, and the masses often could not buy them when they were sold. Either the cadres bought them, or those who knew how to get their hands on them bought them, which is called unfair "selling." All cadres above the level of Farmers' Association group leader in the Third District admitted in their self-criticisms at the turn-over conference that they had taken some fruits more or less, or that they had first raised the price when they saw something good, and when the masses did not buy it, they lowered it and bought it themselves.
　　(4) Individual district and county cadres bought cheap things. For example, something that could be sold for 100,000 in the market, some comrades bought it for only a few thousand yuan.
　　(5) In specific distribution, individual villages still do not have a clear idea of who should be entitled to the fruits. For example, to middle peasants who have been harshly treated by feudal forces, they say: "You have your own ways, you don't need to be distributed anything." But individual landlords, because they spent all their money on opium when the enemy was around, now come back to turn over and get things, which the masses call "catching up at both ends." Some places also simply distribute according to whether one is active or not. At the turn-over inspection meeting in Su Village, some peasants proposed that those who do not ask questions, are not active, do not speak, and do not attend meetings should not be distributed anything. They said: "Others kill the tiger, and you come to eat the meat." In fact, those who do not make a sound get nothing.
　　Seize the Opportunity to Educate Cadres and Correct Deviations in a Timely Manner
　　The reason these problems occurred is that in the past, the leadership only paid attention to organizing struggles, finding the root of poverty, and complaining and reasoning, while not paying enough attention to the issue of distributing fruits. According to Tunliu's experience, the basic key to solving this problem is to first educate the cadres and clarify their understanding of "land to the tiller," so that they realize that if this problem is not corrected immediately, it will seriously affect the thorough realization of "land to the tiller." Secondly, it is necessary to explain to the masses that those who are not active and do not make a sound are not brave when fighting tigers because they have not dispelled their concerns. Our task is to educate them, not to passively reject them. Some people also advocate that so-called "lackeys" should not be allowed to get any fruits. We must let the masses understand that most of these people were forced to curry favor with others because they were oppressed. As for simply deciding the amount of fruit distribution based on whether one is active or not, some people say: This can stimulate backward elements to participate in the struggle. In fact, this method will only encourage active elements to despise "backward elements" and "people who do not make a sound." The result will be what the masses say, "Capable people turn over, but poor people cannot turn over."

### 屯留发现果实分配不公

　　屯留发现果实分配不公
    一、滥支滥用不分给群众
    二、该分给谁观念不明确
    【本报阳城十三日电】屯留群运，在十月十八日以来的各种翻身大会上，经过群众反映与干部反省，发现分配果实过程中存在着许多问题，影响到耕者有其田的彻底实现。
    （一）挪用果实，不分给群众。据三区工作同志们谈，政权曾令留一部分果实，准备办民办小学及村公费等项开支；武委会通知，叫留一部分给民兵买枪；村干部自己叫留一部分开合作社。检查结果，十九个村，共保存果实粮三千八百多石，如将房屋并土地等一齐算入，则数目当更大。
    （二）果实保存中，发现有滥支滥用现象。如老军庄农会，将大批果实存在农会不分，每天派民兵看守，今天说这少了，明天说那短了，群众要算账就推宕。少数干部不通过群众而先把像样的东西卖了；有些农会干部，到处投资生产，不知是那里来的钱，群众议论纷纷。四区下旺村，半年来即唱了六台戏，用去果实粮一百一十七石，修戏台还用了五石米，大吃大喝用的还在外。×区×村村干部，拿果实开合作社，成立军人招待所，结果，他们成天在里边大吃大喝。
    （三）分配不公。三区苏村、洼子、茶棚等村，有所谓“三不公”的说法，即贫苦农民与斗争对象问题多的人，算下来反分的少，没问题或问题少的人反多分，这叫“算”的不公；果实分配时也未完全经农民同意，不需要院子的却硬分给了院子，要牲口的分不上，有牲口的反分上了牲口，这叫“分”的不公；有些东西因为少，出卖时群众常常买不上，不是干部买了，就是有办法的买上了，这叫“卖”的不公。三区全区农会小组长以上干部，在翻身会上反省，都承认或多或少拿过一些果实，或见东西好时先把价钱作贵，群众不买时，自己再降低买上。
    （四）个别区县干部，买便宜东西，比如市场上可卖十来万的东西，有些同志，也就只用几千元买下了。
    （五）具体分配时，个别村子对什么人应该分得果实的观念尚不明确。如对受过封建势力刻薄的中农说：“你有办法，你不用分”；而个别地主，因为敌人在时，自己吃大烟挥霍光了，现在反又来翻身分东西，群众叫这种人是“两头赶上”。个别地方还有单纯按照积极不积极来分的，苏村在翻身检查会上，有些农民就提议不提问题、不积极、不说话、不开会的人不分。他们说：“人家打死老虎你来吃肉”。实际上是不哼气的人分不到。
  抓紧教育干部及时纠正偏向
    所以发生这些问题，是由于过去一个时期中，领导上只注意组织斗争、找穷根、诉苦说理等问题，而对分配果实这一问题注意不够。解决这一问题的基本关键，据屯留的经验，是首先必须教育干部，明确干部对耕者有其田的认识，使他们认识到这一问题如不立即纠正，将严重影响耕者有其田的彻底实现。其次必须向群众说明，不积极不哼气的人，打虎时他不勇敢，是因为他没有解除顾虑，我们的任务，是教育他们，不是消极拒绝他们。还有些人主张所谓“狗腿”都不叫分得果实，我们必须让群众了解这些人中，多数是被压迫不得已而巴结人家的。至于单纯按积极与否，来决定果实分配的多少，有些人说：这可刺激落后分子参加斗争，事实上这种办法更会助长积极分子轻视“落后分子”，“不哼气的人”，其结果便将弄成群众所说“能人翻身，穷人翻不了身”。
