Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 14th -- Comprehensive Report: The trusteeship issue is currently a focal point in the work of the United Nations General Assembly committees. Especially after the US representative put forward trusteeship proposals, the debate on this issue has intensified. According to the United Nations Charter, the purpose of trusteeship is to enable non-self-governing peoples to gradually move towards independence and autonomy. However, the US proposal aims for exclusive control. Truman's statement on the 6th and Dulles's (US Deputy Representative to the United Nations General Assembly, foreign policy advisor to Republican reactionary Dewey) speech on the 7th echoed each other, stating that the former Japanese-mandated islands, currently occupied by US forces, should be placed under US trusteeship. After his speech, Dulles stated at a press conference, "If the United Nations opposes the US trusteeship proposal, the United States will maintain its rule over the islands." The US policy has provoked criticism from all sides. The British Manchester Guardian wrote that the US, without consulting its allies, is attempting to annex all the Japanese Pacific islands in this way. "What else is this but imperialism?" The New York Herald Tribune wrote that this declaration is "allowing the world to say that the United States is playing a two-faced policy of dishonesty. One policy adopts the perspective of the Atlantic Charter and the United Nations Charter regarding the interests of the Allies; while the other adopts a unilateral policy related to the interests of the United States."

The trusteeship issue has been discussed for several days in the Fourth Committee of the General Assembly, but no active results have been achieved. The Charter stipulates that there are three types of territories that can be placed under United Nations trusteeship, the main one being the former League of Nations mandated territories, involving eight countries, namely Britain, France, Belgium, Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, and the United States. The Charter stipulates that trusteeship territories can only be realized after direct relevant countries have negotiated and concluded a sufficient number of trusteeship agreements. If this procedure cannot be completed, the Trusteeship Council cannot be established. The policies of certain countries are currently hindering the establishment of the Trusteeship Council. When discussing this issue, Soviet representative Novikov declared in the General Assembly on the 11th, "Some of the existing draft agreements have many defects that must be corrected. Some parts of the draft agreements violate the principles of the Charter." He said, "These plans do not stipulate the conditions of trusteeship, making it possible to lead non-self-governing countries to full independence; on the contrary, the plans set a contrary trend." Novikov emphasized the enormous political importance of the trusteeship issue, concluding by saying: Hundreds of millions of human beings are relying on the United Nations to give them full freedom. Certain representatives should abandon all selfish considerations.

    美违背宪章托管原则
    图独占日委任统治地
    联大讨论中各方猛予抨击
    【新华社延安十四日电】综合报导：托管问题是目前联合国大会各委员会工作中的重点，尤其在美国代表提出托管意见之后，这一问题的争辩已日益展开。根据联合国宪章，托管的目的是使非自治的民族逐渐走向独立自主。而美国的意见却是要独占。杜鲁门于六日声明于先，杜勒斯（美国出席联大的副代表，共和党反动派杜威的外交顾问）于七日在和会演说于后，一致唱和，要将现由美军占领的前日本委任统治各岛屿，置于美国托管之下。杜氏于演说之后，在记者招待会上表示：“如联合国反对美国之托管建议，则美国将保持对各岛的统治权”。美国的政策引起各方的抨击，英国的曼彻斯特导报写道：美国未有与其盟国磋商，竟图以此法合并全部日本太平洋岛屿“此非帝国主义为何”？纽约先驱论坛报著文称：此种声明，是“让全世界说美国玩耍不讲信义的两面政策。一个政策是对盟邦利害攸关者，采取大西洋宪章及联合国宪章的观点；而另一方面，则采取与美国利害有关的单方面政策。
    托管问题，正在联大第四委员会讨论多日，目前尚无积极结果。宪章规定有三种领土可置于联合国托管之下，主要的一种是前国联的委任统治地，牵涉八个国家，即英、法、比、澳、南非、新西兰和美国等。宪章规定托管领土须由直接有关各国经过谈判并订立充分数目之托管协定后，始能实现。如果这种程序不能完成，则托管理事会便不能成立。某些国家的政策现正在阻碍托管理事会的成立。在论及这一问题时，苏联代表诺维科夫于十一日在联大宣称：“已有的某些协定草案，其中有许多缺陷，必须纠正，协议草案有些地方与宪章的原则相违背。”他说：“这些计划中并没有规定托管的条件，使有可能导使非自治国家达到完全独立；反之，计划却制定了相反的趋向。”诺维科夫强调托管问题的巨大政治重要性，他的结语说：成百成万的人类，正依赖联合国给他们之充分的自由。某些代表是应该放弃一切自私考虑的。
