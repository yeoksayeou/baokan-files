　　The Wu'an Chiang Kai-shek Special Agent Case Comes to a Close
    Dozens of Confessing Elements Released
    Principal Culprit Niu Yongliang and Others Still Under Interrogation
    [Our Newspaper, Wu'an News] Just as the traitor Chiang Kai-shek is desperately attempting to invade northern Henan, our Wu'an Public Security Bureau, at the beginning of last month, completely cracked down on all of Chiang Kai-shek's county and district special agent organizations within Wu'an, and none of the more than forty people in the county and district leadership organization, including Niu Yongliang, escaped the net. It also seized one copy each of documents and poison. After half a month of interrogation and their confessions of repentance, the initial stage came to an end on the 20th. According to confessions: The Wu'an Chiang Kai-shek special agent organization once organized a "Mid-Autumn Festival Riot" which failed, arranged to shoot people from the shadows, poisoned the Wu'an County Government, resulting in the poisoning of a section chief of the County Government, and poisoned the teachers' training class, causing more than fifty teachers to fall ill. It sabotaged mass movements and production, and attacked labor heroes and active educational workers. Its military conspiracy to cooperate with Chiang Kai-shek's attack on northern Henan was thwarted by the Wu'an Public Security Bureau before it could be carried out. Our democratic government still adheres to the policy of leniency, releasing dozens of people who were deceived and who truly confessed, while the principal culprit Niu Yongliang, who is guilty of heinous crimes, is still under continued interrogation.

　　武安蒋特案告一段落
    数十坦白分子被释
    主犯牛永亮等仍在审讯中
    【本报武安讯】正值卖国贼蒋介石亟图进犯豫北声中，我武安公安局于上月初，将武安境内蒋介石之县区特务机关全部破获，其县区领导机关牛永亮等四十余人无一漏网。并获文件毒药各一部，经半月之审讯和他们的坦白自新，至二十日初步告一段落。据供称：武安蒋介石特务机关曾组织“中秋节暴动”未逞，布置打黑枪，给武安县府下毒，致使县府某科长中毒，给教员训练班下毒，使五十多位教员病倒。破坏群众运动和生产，打击劳动英雄和积极的教育工作者。其配合蒋介石进攻豫北的军事阴谋尚未进行，即为武安公安局破获。我民主政府仍本宽大政策，将上当分子和真正坦白的数十人释放，而罪大恶极的主犯牛永亮仍在继续审讯中。（庭栋、一农）
