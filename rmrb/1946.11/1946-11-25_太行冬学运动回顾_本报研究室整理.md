A Review of the Taihang Winter Literacy Campaign
    Compiled by the Research Office of this Newspaper

    The winter literacy campaign is about to begin. Taihang is preparing teaching materials based on the local situation and the instructions of the Administrative Office. Obligatory teachers trusted by the masses are being selected and undergoing intensive training. The plan is to strengthen the masses’ correct understanding of the current situation through winter literacy programs, to strengthen their confidence in victory, to inspire enthusiasm for fully supporting the war, and to implement ideological education on "land to the tiller" and production for prosperity. This year’s winter literacy program will better serve the war effort, mass movements, and production. The Taihang winter literacy campaign has accumulated many experiences and lessons through years of exploration and creation. The development of the winter literacy program has generally gone through the following process:

    In 1942, Taihang deeply mobilized the masses to implement rent reduction and interest rate reduction. Education on policies, laws, and the prospect of victory (victory in two years) began in the winter literacy programs. Some advanced areas adopted the method of combining winter literacy programs with practical work, using rent reduction and interest rate reduction decrees as teaching materials to promote the development of the rent reduction and interest rate reduction movement, which achieved good results. However, formalism still occupied a major position. Enrollment was mostly compulsory, with formal curriculum schedules and mechanical class divisions. Organizing women to study often disregarded their family conditions and personal needs. The selection of voluntary teachers mostly involved finding those who could write and calculate, but these people often lacked transformation and were intellectuals in the countryside, or even children of old feudal rulers or landlords. Village cadres did not pay much attention to the winter literacy program, and the content of education was far from the needs of the masses. Sometimes each system emphasized its central work, and the winter literacy program fell into stagnation. In 1943, cadres throughout the district underwent current affairs education, and this study quickly penetrated into the winter literacy program. A mass reflection on understanding current affairs was carried out in the winter literacy program, with great gains in breaking down the "change of dynasty" mentality and orthodox concepts. The district party committee also paid attention to mobilizing troops and office cadres to help the winter literacy program in the villages. Village cadres also attended the winter literacy program like the masses and gave political lessons to the masses. The masses began to feel that the winter literacy program was a place for "brainwashing." In terms of teaching methods, mass reflection and discussion were the main focus, and the "spoon-feeding" method was largely abandoned. In the later stage of the winter literacy program, a campaign to support the army and reflect was carried out. The masses further recognized the essence of their own soldiers and the people’s army, which promoted a wave of support for the army throughout the district. Although this year’s winter literacy program had new gains and creations, the really significant achievements were made in 1944. In 1944, after the district-wide large-scale production and cadre rectification, coupled with the publication of the Yan'an New Education Policy, cadres had new insights in their work style and began to consciously use the mass line method to lead the winter literacy program, adhering to the principles of voluntariness and need to organize the masses to learn. In terms of teaching methods, they adopted the approach of teaching what they wanted to learn, teaching what they did, teaching who knew, learning to teach others, and learning from each other. Organizational forms were as flexible as possible, and the masses could voluntarily combine. A large number of model "little teachers" and "hundred-character teachers" appeared, and the method of "people teaching people" was greatly promoted. In terms of content, attention was paid to combining with practical work. For example, during the rent review, the winter literacy program launched the education of "think about the past, compare with the present." Active elements took the lead in gathering the masses, and the winter literacy program became a place for the masses to understand and complain. Many farmers became aware and participated in the struggle. The number of students increased universally, and the enrollment rate in many villages reached over 90%. In other places, such as Zuoquan and Neiqiu, various small winter literacy programs were created according to the scattered mountain villages, and the masses were also very satisfied. Because the masses improved their love for the winter literacy program, the problems of heating and lighting in the winter literacy program, which had not been solved for many years, were solved by the masses themselves. By the spring of 1945, most of the winter literacy programs had been transformed into people's schools, becoming regular places for ideological education of the masses and the locomotive of central work. After the counter-offensive in 1945, the winter literacy program also developed in the newly liberated areas, launching the people’s anti-traitor and revenge movement. The winter literacy program in the old areas mobilized the masses to summarize the experience of eight years of struggle, improving their awareness and determination to fight. Looking back at the entire development process of the Taihang winter literacy program, the following experiences can be drawn:

    The first is to grasp the principles of voluntariness and need of the masses, which is the issue of the mass line in the leadership of the winter literacy program. For example, Zhao Jingyuan, a model voluntary teacher in Shuimen, Xingtai, said: "There is no trick to running a winter literacy program. Give the masses what they want. This is a very simple mass line approach." During the spring plowing season in Shuimen, mutual aid teams had difficulty calculating work points. He saw in the newspaper that the work point method in Wu Township was very good, so he explained the benefits and uses of work points in the winter literacy program, which was very popular among the masses. Many mutual aid teams adopted work points. The universal increase in the number of students in 1944, the development of small winter literacy programs, and various creations in learning were the results of adapting to the requirements of the masses and adhering to the principle of voluntary enrollment. This is the most basic experience. The second is the issue of combining with practical work. Several years of exploration have proven that the development of the winter literacy program is combined with rent reduction, production, current affairs education, etc., that is, it must start from the actual needs of the masses and serve the masses in order to improve the winter literacy program. For example, according to the experience of Shuxin Village, everyone wanted to learn production technology, so labor heroes were invited to lecture in the winter literacy program; to organize transportation, mobilization and organization were carried out in the winter literacy program; all the villagers loved the winter literacy program and regarded it as the locomotive of all their work. However, it must be noted that the winter literacy program is not the village office. Its main purpose is to enlighten the masses, promote and coordinate ideological education in combination with practical work. Conflating the two will reduce its educational significance. The third is that teaching methods and organizational forms need to grasp the basic principles of voluntariness and need. Naturally, in teaching methods, the old form of "teachers lecturing and students listening" must be changed, and the mass line method must be adopted. Labor heroes can be production teachers, those who know a hundred characters can be hundred-character teachers, those who complain and reason and are awakened can teach the unawakened farmers to awaken and struggle, and demobilized soldiers can teach the militia to learn martial arts... Everyone discusses and learns from each other, and those with a skill can be teachers. In organizational form, organize in whatever way the masses welcome, breaking the mechanical division of youth classes and ordinary classes. The small winter literacy programs developed in Taihang in 1944 adapted to the creation of the masses. Small winter literacy programs generally have these types: one is that it is inconvenient to go to school at night in the village streets or scattered mountain villages, so they are divided by street or region under a unified plan, and a village can be divided into four or five or more. Another type is divided according to production organization and habits, such as organizing learning according to transportation teams and women’s textile teams. Many mutual aid teams in Zuoquan, Yushe, and other places formed their own small winter literacy programs. Still another type is a voluntary combination according to individual needs. For example, a group of young people are willing to learn more culture or production technology, and in addition to the overall general learning, they form their own small winter literacy programs and find their own teachers to learn... In short, as long as attention is paid to understanding the requirements of the masses and grasping the basic methods of the mass line, the masses themselves will have various creations.

　　太行冬学运动回顾
    本报研究室整理
    冬学运动即将开始，太行各地正依据本区情况和行署指示，准备教材、选拔群众信任的义务教员进行集训，计划经过冬学，加强群众对目前时局的正确认识，坚定必胜信心，启发全力支援战争的热忱；以及贯彻耕者有其田与生产发家的思想教育；使今年的冬学更好的为战争、群运、生产服务。太行的冬学，经过几年来的摸索和创造，取得不少经验教训，冬学发展大体经过以下过程：
    四二年太行深入发动群众，实行减租减息，开始在冬学进行政策法令及胜利前途（二年胜利）等教育。有些先进地区，采取了冬学与实际工作相结合的方法，以减租减息法令做教材来推动减租减息运动的开展，曾收到很好的结果。但形式主义的作风仍占主要地位；入学大部是强制的，形式的制定课程表，机械的分班分组。组织妇女学习，也多不顾其家庭条件个人需要。选拔义务教员，多是找那些会写会算的，而这些人又多是缺乏改造的在乡知识分子，甚至有些是旧封建统治人物或地主家的子弟。村干部对冬学不大管，教育内容与群众需要相距甚远，有时各系统各强调其中心工作，冬学即陷于停顿。四三年全区干部进行了时事教育，这一学习很快就深入至冬学，冬学中开展了群众性的对时事了解的反省，在打破变天思想与正统观念上，有很大收获。区党委并注意发动部队、机关干部，帮助驻村冬学。村干部也和群众一样上冬学并给群众讲政治课。群众开始感到冬学是“换脑筋”的场所。教法上也以群众反省讨论为主，“填鸭”灌输方式大部被抛弃。冬学后期进行拥军反省，群众进一步认识了自己的子弟兵、人民的军队的本质，推动全区掀起了拥军的热潮。这一年的冬学虽有了新的收获和创造，但真正取得显著成绩的还是四四年。四四年经过全区大生产和干部整风，加以延安新教育方针的发表，干部在做风上有了新的启示，开始有意识的用群众路线的方法，领导冬学，掌握自愿与需要的原则组织群众学习。教法上也采取想学啥就教啥，作啥教啥，谁会谁教，学会教人，互相学习办法。组织形式尽量求得活变，群众可自愿结合。模范小先生百字先生大批出现，“民教民”的办法大大发扬。内容上注意与实际工作结合，如查减中冬学即开展了“想想过去，比比现在”的教育，积极分子带头团聚群众，冬学成为群众明理诉苦的场所，不少农民由此觉悟参加斗争；入学人数普遍增多，不少村入学人数达百分之九十以上。其他在左权、内邱等地，依据分散的山沟创办各种小冬学，群众也很满意。由于群众提高了对冬学的热爱，因此历年来所解决不了的冬学中的烤火点灯问题，群众都自己想办法解决了。到四五年春大部冬学都转为民校成为经常性的群众思想教育场所和中心工作的火车头。四五年反攻以后，冬学在新解放区也有发展，发动了人民的反奸复仇运动。老区冬学发动群众总结八年斗争经验，提高了觉悟与斗争决心。回顾太行冬学的整个发展过程可得出以下的经验：
    首先是掌握群众自愿与需要的原则，也就是冬学领导上的群众路线问题。如邢台水门模范义教赵景元说：办冬学没啥巧法，群众要啥就给他啥，这就是很朴素的群众路线的作法。水门在春耕时，互助组因计工发生困难，他在报上看到武乡工票法很好，就在冬学讲工票好处和用法，很受群众欢迎，许多互助组都采用了工票。四四年入学人数的普遍增多，小冬学的发展，及学习上的各种创造，就是适应了群众的要求，坚持入学自愿的原则的结果。这是最基本的一点经验。其次是与实际工作结合的问题。几年的摸索证明：冬学的发展，是结合着减租、生产、时事教育等而发展的，即是要从群众实际需要出发，为群众服务，冬学才能提高。如树辛村的经验，大家要学习生产技术，就在冬学请劳动英雄讲；要组织运输，就在冬学动员组织；全村群众都热爱冬学，认为是他们一切工作的火车头。但必须注意冬学不是村公所，他主要是启发群众觉悟、推动配合结合实际工作进行思想教育，混淆起来就会降底了它的教育意义。再次是教法和组织形式上需掌握自愿需要的基本原则，在教法上自然要改变“先生讲学生听”的老形式而走群众路线的方法，劳动英雄能当生产先生，识一百字的就能当百字先生，诉苦说理先觉悟了的就能教没觉悟的农民觉醒起来斗争，退伍军人就能教民兵学武……大家讨论、互相学习，有一技之长就能当先生。在组织形式上群众欢迎怎样就怎样组织，打破机械划分青年班普通班的形式。太行四四年发展的小冬学，就是适应群众的创造，小冬学一般有这几种：一种是村大街长或分散山庄，晚上入学不便，在统一计划下按街按地区分，一村可分四、五个不等。一种是按生产组织和习惯分，如按运输组，妇女纺织组等组织学习，左权、榆社等地不少互助队自成一小冬学。再一种是按个人需要自愿结合，如一伙青年愿多学文化或生产技术，在全体总的学习外，自成小冬学自找先生学习……总之只要注意了解群众要求，掌握群众路线的基本作法，群众自己会有各种创造的。
