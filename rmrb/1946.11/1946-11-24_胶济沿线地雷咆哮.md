Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 20th—Landmines are constantly roaring under the feet of the Chiang troops along the Jiaoji Railway line. The Gaomi Armed Force to Protect the People's Liberation Team, led by the people's militia hero Liu Changshou, densely planted landmines on the main roads in the Dalu Village area east of the city, killing more than ten people and destroying two vehicles. Chiang's troops who trespassed into Ye County stepped on mines in Gaojiaji Village south of the city, and three people were blown to pieces. The Huantai militia, using landmines combined with sniper tactics, killed and captured forty Chiang soldiers in eight battles, seized two American-style submachine guns, and recovered many strongholds such as Sibaoshan. They destroyed thirty-six Chiang-controlled village offices and established fifteen democratic village offices, scaring the Chiang troops so much that they did not dare to show their faces for twenty days.
