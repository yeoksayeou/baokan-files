Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 31st. Reports from various sources: Stalin's reply to Mr. White, President of the Composite Press, has been given great importance by all parties. According to a dispatch from the United Press on the 29th, London political circles (as well as Washington) called it "a sensational one with a growing hope, indicating that this may be another sign of close unity between the Western and Eastern powers, and even the beginning of the end of the war talk that has been permeating the world for the past six months or so." It is expected that this opinion will affect the progress of the United Nations General Assembly. After a day of in-depth study, the British Foreign Office decided not to issue a formal comment; however, London diplomatic circles pointed out that "Stalin's reply is firm, but not unfriendly." On the 29th, editorials in all morning newspapers in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, stated that Stalin's reply "will open the way to improving relations between the major powers." After Stalin's reply was published, US Secretary of State Byrnes met with Truman for four hours. In response to American reporters' questions about his opinion of Stalin, he said: no other comments, he told reporters to refer to his broadcast address to the American people on July 15th of this year (regarding the report on the draft of the five-nation treaty passed by the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference) and the words spoken in the Stuttgart statement on September 6th.

　　斯氏谈话反响
    英美舆论认为：将是东西强国间团结一致的征兆
    【新华社延安三十一日电】综合各方讯：斯大林答复合众社社长白理的电文发表后，各方极予重视。据合众社廿九日电称：伦敦政界（华盛顿亦如此）称之为“轰动一时的有一种日益增长的希望，表示这可能是西方与东方强国间密切一致的另一征兆，而且甚至于结束最近六个月来或现在弥漫世界的战争谈论的开始”。并预料此一意见，将影响联合国大会之进程，英外交部整日深刻研究后，决定不发表正式评论；但伦敦外交界方面，则指出“斯大林的答复，是坚决的，但不是不友谊的。”廿九日瑞典京城各晨报社论，均称斯大林这一答复“将开辟改善各大国间关系之道路”。斯大林答复发表后，美国务卿贝纳斯即与杜鲁门会谈达四小时。他在答复美记者询问其对斯大林之意见时称：没有其他评论，他叫记者参阅他今年七月十五日对美国人民的广播演说。（按系关于巴黎外长会议通过五国和约草案的报告）与九月六日斯图加特声明中所讲的话。
