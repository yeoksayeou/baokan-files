　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 26th. The national traitor and Central Hu bandit Xie Wendong was captured by our forces on the 22nd of this month, and his bandit gang of more than 400 people has been wiped out. Furthermore, the remnant bandits of more than 500 men under the national traitor Li Huatang were completely annihilated by the troops of the Hegang Military Region after pursuit and encirclement. The people far and wide rejoiced upon hearing this. Note: Xie Wendong, a native of Yilan County, Hegang Province, was originally a large landlord. After surrendering to the enemy in 1938, he specialized in sabotaging the rear of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army. The masses in Yilan, Boli, and Fangzheng counties who were harmed by him are too numerous to count. After the "August 15th" surrender of the Japanese bandits, he transformed himself into a "Central Vanguard Army" appointed by Chiang Kai-shek, and concurrently served as the commander of the Third Army of the already executed traitor and the division commander of Jiang Pengfei's forces.

　　谢匪文东被我擒获
    【新华社延安二十六日电】民族叛逆中央胡匪谢逆文东已于本月二十二日为我俘获，其匪部四百余人已告扑灭。又民族叛逆李华堂所部残匪五百余人，经合江军区部队追踪围击，业已全部就歼。远近人民闻之莫不举手称庆。按：谢逆文东，合江省依兰县人，原系大地主，民国二十七年投敌后，专事破坏东北抗日联军后方，依兰、勃利、方正等县群众被其残害者不可胜数。“八一五”日寇投降后，复摇身一变为蒋介石加委为“中央先遣军”，并兼任已伏法之逆部第三军军长及姜逆鹏飞部师长等职。
