Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 23rd: "Although the American and Chinese representatives both argued that it was necessary for American troops to remain in China, whether this is truly necessary is questionable." This was stated by Molotov on the 22nd at the UN General Assembly's Political and Security Committee. Molotov also said: "The Chinese representative stated here that certain detachments of American troops are currently stationed in China based on agreements made between the United States and China; however, this naturally raises the question of whether the Chinese government truly needs foreign troops now that the war has passed?" The UN General Assembly's Political and Security Committee continued its discussion of the investigation into foreign troops stationed abroad on the 21st and 22nd. On the 21st, the Polish representative supported the Soviet proposal. (Note: The Soviet proposal was that the UN General Assembly should request the Security Council to order UN member states to submit the following information within one month: 1. The number and location of troops from UN member states stationed in various countries around the world, excluding the territories of former enemy states. 2. The number and location of troops from various countries stationed in former enemy states. 3. The location and number of troops at naval and air bases within the aforementioned territories. 4. The information mentioned above should reflect the situation as of November 1, 1946.) The Panamanian representative condemned the fact that US troops had not yet withdrawn from the country. The Egyptian representative expressed the hope that troops stationed in non-enemy territories would withdraw quickly. The French representative advocated for an investigation into foreign troops stationed within UN territories and proposed a substantial reduction in these forces; certain strategic bases should be handled by the Security Council. The Chiang Kai-shek government representative defended the US troops stationed in China. The British representative argued that the "real problem" was disarmament rather than investigating troops stationed abroad and advocated for merging the discussion of investigating troops stationed abroad with the issue of disarmament. In response, Molotov criticized this at the meeting on the 22nd, opposing the British side's mixing of the issue of domestic troops with the issue of troops stationed abroad. He said: "The issue of domestic troops is related to the general issue of disarmament, while the issue of troops stationed abroad should be resolved urgently." After tracing back to the Security Council's statement several months ago that Soviet troops should withdraw from Iran, he asked: "Why does this same decision not apply to British troops in Greece and American troops in China?" Molotov also stated that the Soviet Union itself was prepared to provide all information on its troops stationed abroad, and that a report on the Soviet Union's own troops would also be submitted when dealing with the issue of disarmament. The French representative also expressed support for the Soviet proposal to investigate troops stationed abroad, calling it: "The first step towards universal disarmament," which should be implemented immediately without waiting for further information on the total strength of each country.

　　联大继续讨论外国驻军问题
    莫洛托夫指斥美军驻华
    法国巴拿马埃及等代表支持苏方提议蒋政府代表死不要脸为驻华美军辩护
    【新华社延安二十三日电】成功湖讯：“虽然美国与中国代表均辩解美军有留华必要，但是否真正需要诚是疑问。”这是莫洛托夫二十二日在联大政治安全委员会上所说的。莫氏又说：“中国代表在此声明，美军之某些派遣队现仍留驻中国，乃是根据中美两国所订协议云云；可是这自然引起了一个问题，即现在战争既已过去，中国政府是否真正非有外国军队不成呢？”联大政治安全委员会于二十一、二十二两日继续讨论调查外国驻军问题。二十一日，波兰代表支持苏联的建议。（按：苏联建议为联合国大会应要求安理会命令联合国会员国在一个月内提出下列情报：一、除前敌国领土外之联合国会员国驻留世界各国之军队人数及地点。二、各国驻留在前敌国之军队人数及地点。三、在上述领土内海、空军基地之地点及军队数量。四、上项情报中所述者应为一九四六年十一月一日之情况。）巴拿马代表谴责美军尚未撤离该国。埃及代表希望非敌国领土驻军能迅速撤退。法代表主张调查驻在联合国领土内的外国军队，并提议切实减少此项兵力；某些战略基地应交由安理会处理。蒋介石政府代表则为美军驻华辩护。英代表则认为“真正问题”为裁军而非调查驻军，乃主张把调查驻军与裁军两项问题合并讨论。对此，莫洛托夫于二十二日会议予以批评，反对英方将国内军队与国外驻军两问题混为一谈。他说：“国内军队问题是与一般裁军问题有关，而国外驻军问题则应紧急解决。”他于追溯数月前安理会曾宣称苏军应撤离伊朗后，问道：“这同一决定，为什么不适用于英国驻希腊军队及美国驻华军队呢？”莫氏并表示：苏联本身准备提供其驻外军队的一切情报，而关于苏联本国军队亦将在处理裁军问题时提出报告。法代表亦表示赞助苏方调查驻外军队的建议，称之为：“普遍裁军的第一步”，应即刻实行，不必等待进一步获得各国总兵力的情报。
