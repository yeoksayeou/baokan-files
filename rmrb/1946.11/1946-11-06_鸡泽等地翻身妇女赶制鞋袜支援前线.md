　　Liberated Women in Jize and Other Places
    Rush to Make Shoes and Socks to Support the Front Lines
    [Report from our newspaper in Wei County, 2nd] To support the front lines, women in various places are rushing to make cotton clothes, quilts, shoes, and socks for the new soldiers. More than 300 women in Wuxun Liulin, under the leadership of the women's association, collectively made cotton quilts for the new soldiers. In one afternoon, they sewed more than 300 cotton quilts, and they didn't stop working even when it got dark. They all said, "It doesn't matter if we are a little tired, we must not let the soldiers go hungry. They are fighting at the front, and we must work as hard as if we are fighting too." The director of the Women's Salvation Association in Yongzhi Liuzhaizi immediately ran to the anti-Japanese alliance to collect materials for making shoes after hearing the news about making shoes and socks for the new soldiers. After one night, they made the shoes and sent them over, and firmly refused to accept any manual labor fees. The women in Jize Second District, after being liberated, worked day and night to make shoes for the soldiers. A large number of shoes and socks have now been delivered to the district headquarters.

　　鸡泽等地翻身妇女
    赶制鞋袜支援前线
    【本报威县二日电】为支援前线，各地妇女正给新战士赶制棉衣、棉被、鞋袜。武训柳林的三百多妇女，在妇会领导下集体给新战士们赶制棉被，一个下午的功夫，缝好了三百多条棉被，天黑了还不停工，都说：“咱们累点没啥，一定不能叫战士们挨冻，他们在前方打仗，咱也得像打仗一样的紧着干呀。”永智刘寨子妇救会主任听到给新战士做鞋袜消息后，马上跑到抗联里领上做鞋东西，经过一夜时间，就做好送来，并坚决不领手工米。鸡泽二区翻身后的妇女们，昼夜不息的为战士做鞋，大批鞋袜现已送交区部。
