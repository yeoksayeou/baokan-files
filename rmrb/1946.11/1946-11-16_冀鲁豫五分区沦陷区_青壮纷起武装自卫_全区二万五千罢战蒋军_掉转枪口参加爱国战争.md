    [This newspaper, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, Fourteenth Dispatch] Since Chiang Kai-shek's troops invaded our Fifth Sub-district, they have engaged in rampant burning, killing, looting, and raping, arousing the soaring righteous indignation of the local masses. Militias and young people in various counties have joined guerrilla forces to resist Chiang Kai-shek and defend themselves. Three hundred youths from Dongyuan spontaneously formed the Yellow River Detachment, and six hundred militiamen from Kaocheng established an independent regiment. In Heze, Nanhua, Dingtao, and other counties, hundreds of people have joined local legions or guerrilla units. They penetrate deep into the rear of the Chiang army, constantly harass the enemy, and launch propaganda among the masses about the inevitable defeat of the Chiang army, safeguarding the democratic government and implementing its administrative orders. The Chiang army fears the guerrillas and dares not venture out of its strongholds, and the "Homecoming Legions" dare not act alone.
    [This newspaper special dispatch] As of the 10th, among the thirteen Chiang army brigades annihilated by the soldiers and civilians of Jin-Hebei-Lu-Yu, 25,000 people have voluntarily joined the People's Liberation Army and are bravely fighting against the invading Chiang army. Zheng Yujing, a soldier from the 59th Regiment of the 20th Brigade of the 3rd Reorganized Division, laid down his weapons on the morning of September 6th in Dayang Lake, and in the afternoon, he took up the gun he had brought with him to pursue the retreating Chiang army, capturing one prisoner and one gun. The next day, he captured two prisoners and two guns. Xu Chaosun, a superior soldier from the same unit, also killed or wounded more than ten Chiang soldiers on the second day. Ge Jin, the captain of the Chiang army security team liberated during the Longhai Campaign, went to shout to the Chiang army as soon as he laid down his weapons, causing all the Chiang soldiers in the bunker at Yejigang Station to lay down their weapons. Wang Dewen, who was liberated during the battle of Lanfeng, captured two Chiang soldiers and seized three rifles in the battle of Dayang Lake. Dong Chuncheng killed eight Chiang soldiers while defending Dong Village. Hu Xiaode used six rifle grenades to fire into the window of the Chiang army headquarters in Caojiagai, destroying the entire headquarters. The four of them captured six Chiang soldiers and seized seven rifles. Song Qixiang, who came from the 3rd Reorganized Division, captured one machine gun and one rifle in the battle of Juanbei. Many Chiang soldiers who laid down their weapons cried at the anti-civil war grievance meetings, lamenting the misery of being forced to participate in the civil war. Liu Yun, a soldier from the 55th Division, cried, "All four of my brothers have been drafted, and only my eighty-year-old mother is left at home. My eldest and second brothers died when they were sent to Laohekou to fight the New Fourth Army, and the third brother was sent to the Northeast, and I don't know if he is alive or dead. There is no one to take care of my mother, and there is no land at home." Luo Yanbin, a soldier from the 3rd Reorganized Division, said, "It's all Chiang Kai-shek's fault that we're suffering." They voluntarily asked to join the Liberation Army in batches and fight to the death against Chiang Kai-shek and the American imperialists. Wei Suyuan, the deputy company commander of the direct combat anti-aircraft artillery company of the 122nd Brigade of the 41st Division, led all 57 officers and soldiers of the company to join a certain artillery battalion on the front line. Ying Han, the company commander of the 2nd Armored Regiment, and 50 other tank crew members joined our military region's tank team. They have all become heroic soldiers and have begun to consciously abide by mass discipline. Wu Deshan, a soldier from the 181st Division, saw several newly liberated comrades picking dates and eating them, and loudly warned them, "Comrades! We are Eighth Route Army now, don't violate mass discipline!"
