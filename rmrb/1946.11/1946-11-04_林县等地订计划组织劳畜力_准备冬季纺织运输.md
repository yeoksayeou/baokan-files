(This dispatch from Changzhi) After the autumn harvest, Taihang farmers have begun preparations for the winter production campaign. Village cooperatives in Lin (County), Zan (Huang), and He (Shun) areas are currently organizing labor and animal power, purchasing weaving tools, and engaging in winter weaving and transportation. The 11th District of Lin County convened a meeting of cooperative directors from various villages on the 20th of this month to arrange winter production, emphasizing that each group, household, and individual should formulate plans, organize diverse production activities, and overcome the mentality of focusing on large profits and neglecting small gains. The goal is to have each laborer earn 5,000 yuan and each woman spin 30 jin of cotton. The Wangjiaping Cooperative in Zanhuang bought a cotton carding machine and more than 700 jin of cotton to provide capital for the women in the village for winter weaving in order to promote weaving on a large scale. Xiaodongzhang in Pingshun has also drawn up precise plans to use eight donkeys for transportation, ten laborers for carrying loads, and organize three small cooperatives, with women spinning 400 jin of cotton in winter. This winter, they can make a profit of more than 400,000 yuan to compensate for the losses caused by frost damage this autumn and achieve the goal of "cultivating for three and having a surplus for one." Under the leadership of labor hero Zhao Fuke, Heshun Heshan Village has already started transportation and plans to earn 100,000 yuan this winter. Women's weaving can provide clothing for all 150 households in the village, and the remaining labor can be used for buying and selling goods to solve the farmers' petty expenses such as buying salt.
