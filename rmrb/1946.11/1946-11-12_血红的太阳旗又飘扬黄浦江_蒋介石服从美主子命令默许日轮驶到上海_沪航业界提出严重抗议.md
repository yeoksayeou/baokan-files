Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 8th: Shanghai Report: Following the American seizure of coastal navigation rights, Japanese ships, as a "defeated nation," have also openly invaded the Chinese coast with the tacit consent of the Kuomintang authorities. According to the Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury on the 1st, a Japanese ship flew the Japanese flag and entered the Huangpu River dock on the 27th of last month. The ship was designated by MacArthur to come to China and has been anchored for several days without anyone questioning it. Customs officials said: "This is a trade ship of the Central Trust Bureau and MacArthur, and the customs has no jurisdiction." All newspapers and social circles here are extremely indignant about this, believing that this is the prelude to the large-scale arrival of Japanese ships in China. It is reported that the business community has raised questions with the authorities, but there has been no response so far. According to a report from the Central News Agency on the 5th, citing naval sources, the ship and others will transport "economic materials" to China again in the coming days.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 9th: Shanghai Report: The shipping industry here, after investigating and confirming that MacArthur instructed Japanese ships to sail into the Huangpu River, infringing upon Chinese sovereignty, expressed extreme indignation. On the 30th of last month, at the "Port Affairs Committee" meeting held in the city government, they demanded that the authorities immediately lodge a serious protest with MacArthur's headquarters and insisted that the enemy ship be detained and the enemy ship's crew be punished according to law. As of the 1st, the authorities have not yet dealt with it, and the enemy ship with the blood-red sun flag is still proudly anchored at the Huangpu River dock. It is reported that a total of eight enemy ships have sailed to Shanghai this time, and most of the crew members are Japanese.

    【新华社延安八日电】沪讯：随美国侵夺沿海航权之后，作为“战败国”的日本轮船，近亦公然在国民党当局默认下，侵入中国海岸。据此间大美晚报一日载：上月二十七日日轮一艘，高悬日本旗驶入黄浦江码头，该轮系由麦克阿瑟指定来华，停泊数日，无人过问。海关主管人员说：“这是中央信托管理局和麦帅的贸易船、海关管不着”。此间各报及社会各界对此万分愤慨，认为这是日轮大批来华的先声，闻商业界已向当局提出质问，但迄无答复。另据中央社五日报导海军方面消息：该日轮等将于日内载运“经济物资”再度来华。
    【新华社延安九日电】沪讯：此间航业界，对麦克阿瑟指使日本轮船，驶入黄浦江，侵犯中国主权一事，经调查属实后，表示极度愤慨，并于上月三十日，在市府举行的“港务委员会”上，要求当局立即向麦克阿瑟总部，提出严重抗议，并主张将此项敌船扣留，将敌船船员依法惩办。截至一日，当局仍未予处理，而此项悬着血红的太阳旗的敌船，依然骄傲地下泊在黄浦江码头。据悉：此次驶沪敌船，共达八艘，船员大多是日本人。
