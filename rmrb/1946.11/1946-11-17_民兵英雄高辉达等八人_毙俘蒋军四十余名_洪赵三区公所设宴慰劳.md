    Militia Hero Gao Huida and Seven Others
    Kill or Capture Over Forty Chiang Soldiers
    Hongzhao Third District Government Holds Banquet to Console Them
    [Our Newspaper, Taiyue, 14th dispatch] The Third District Government of the Hongdong-Zhaocheng Joint County held a banquet on the 4th to express its gratitude to the village-defending hero Gao Huida and his militia combat team members Dong Baochang, Zhang Qikui, Li Xiaodan, Liu Hongyun, Zhang Weisheng, Zhang Xiaogen, and Li Gongzhi, seven outstanding militia heroes. Cadres from nearby organs and the masses came to admire the demeanor of these eight heroes. During the banquet, Gao Huida reported on the achievements of his heroic militia team in October: In the one month of October, the team fought a total of 27 battles, killing twelve Chiang soldiers, including Qin, the regimental commander of the 181st Regiment of the 61st Brigade, and a major officer, and capturing alive seven people, including the adjutant of the 90th Division headquarters, and wounding 22. The combat team suffered no losses, creating a glorious model battle. On the 21st of last month, when Qin, the regimental commander of the 181st Regiment of the 61st Brigade of the 30th Division of the Chiang army, was heading north and south, he was ambushed by Gao Huida's combat team five miles south of Zhaocheng. Gao Huida and others aimed and shot at Chiang's regimental commander Qin, who was looking at a map about 100 meters away from the Chiang army, killing him on the spot and obtaining an important document. Now the Gao Huida movement has rapidly unfolded throughout the county.
    [Our Newspaper, Taiyue, 15th dispatch] The Taiyue Second Military Subdistrict Command has twice commended the Duan Detachment for penetrating deep into the Chiang army's occupied areas. The commendation order pointed out: The victory of the Duan Detachment in penetrating deep into the rear of the Chiang army "has provided a basis for guerrilla warfare behind Chiang's lines, enhanced the morale of local armed forces and the masses to fight, and dealt a blow to the arrogance of Chiang's puppet troops in harassing the area." In early October, the Duan Detachment moved to Jiangxian, Yicheng, Quwo, and Xiangling counties, actively operating on both sides of the Jiangyi Highway, completely controlled the Fuyi Highway, eliminated the Chiang army entrenched in Dengzhuang Town, Xiangling, recovered the area, drove out the Chiang army from Dongzhang and other places, attacked important strongholds of the Chiang army in Qucun, Quwo, and ambushed the Chiang army in Mengcheng and Liangcun, annihilating a platoon of Chiang soldiers in each place. Its main achievements include: killing or wounding more than 60 Chiang soldiers below the company commander level, capturing 34 alive, seizing two machine guns, 28 rifles and short guns, and four grenade launchers.
