　　The Entire Staff of This Newspaper Cuts Grass to Save Coal
　　[This Newspaper] In response to the call of the Central Bureau and in order to promote a spirit of hard work, the entire staff of this newspaper has been cutting grass in large quantities to save coal, launching a grass-cutting campaign. Starting from after dinner on the 14th, except for some comrades who persisted in their work, everyone went out with their sickles. On the third day, after the news that Comrade Xia Li, who was recuperating, had participated in grass cutting, and that Zhou Qingshu, the communications squad leader, had cut 110 jin of grass in one day, was published on the blackboard newspaper, everyone's enthusiasm became even greater that afternoon. Miao Junjie from the cranking team carried a shoulder pole and cut 150 jin of grass in two nights. Zhang Liande from the transmission station still took time out to cut more than 50 jin of grass during the day while working at night. Even those with children, who were busy, cut more than 10 jin of grass. When the local villagers saw bundles and loads of grass pouring into the village at dusk, they exclaimed in surprise: "The people from the newspaper office have moved the whole mountain back!" According to preliminary statistics, everyone has cut more than 2,800 jin of grass, which is estimated to save 500 jin of coal. The grass-cutting campaign is still ongoing. (Zhi Jian)

　　本报全体同志割草节省燃煤
    【本报讯】本报全体同志响应中央局的号召，发扬艰苦作风，大量割草节省煤炭，掀起割草运动。自十四日晚饭后起，除部分同志坚持工作外，都持镰出动。当第三天墙报上登出夏理同志休养中参加割草，通讯班长周青树一天割草一百一十斤等消息后，当天下午大家劲头更大起来，机摇班苗均杰同志扛着扁担两晚上割草一百五十斤，发报台张连德同志夜间工作白天仍抽空割草五十多斤，就是有小孩的，忙碌中的也都割草十斤以上。驻地老乡们黄昏见到一捆一担的草涌进村来，惊讶的说：“报馆的人把山都搬回来啦！”据目前初步统计大家已割草二千八百多斤，估计可节省煤炭五百斤，现割草运动仍在继续中。（志坚）
