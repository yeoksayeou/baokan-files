Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, November 7th: According to a United Press report from New York on the 4th: At a banquet held by the National Citizens Political Action Committee to conclude the election campaign, Wallace and other speakers hinted that due to the failure of progressive Democrats in the November 5th election campaign, they would lead the organization of a third party. Wallace stated that after resigning as Secretary of Commerce, he deeply felt that he was a free man, and said that on November 6th, he would be even more free. He said, "My resignation in the past was a last resort, but November 6th is different. Regardless of the election results, November 6th will be a day of rebirth for American politics. I am not saying that a third party will be organized on that day, but that day will be a revival of political activity. Otherwise, not only New York State but also progressive elements nationwide will feel frustrated." It is reported that the Political Action Committee of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), the National Citizens Political Action Committee, the Independent Citizens Committee of the Arts, Sciences and Professions, and 14 other groups, had previously organized the "Chicago Progressive Liaison Committee," with CIO President Murray serving as chairman. The committee obtained the support of the American Labor Party, and former Roosevelt cabinet members Morgenthau and Ickes, and former Director of the Office of Economic Stabilization Bowles participated in the committee. A larger meeting will be held in January next year. Murray once declared: "We hope that by mid-1947, all free and progressive elements will join the Liaison Committee." It is generally estimated that if Wallace and Pepper and others organize a third party, they are very likely to gain the support of the committee. Although the two are not currently participating in the committee, because the committee's purpose is to restore Roosevelt's policies, the Liberal Party (formed by the right wing of the American Labor Party), which represents the big bourgeoisie, has publicly stated that it has nothing to do with the committee, but it can be predicted that the committee will gain wider support.

　　华莱士等暗示将组第三党
    【新华社延安七日电】据合众社纽约四日讯：在全国公民政治行动委员会举行之结束竞选运动之宴会中，华莱士及其他演说者，暗示为进步之民主党人于五日竞选运动中失败，他们将领导组织第三党。华氏称：在他辞去商务部长之后，深觉其为一自由之人，并谓在十一月六日我将更为自由。我昔日辞职乃不得已而为之，而十一月六日则不同，无论选举结果如何，十一月六日将为美国政治再生之日，我并不是说将于是日组织第三党，然该日将为政治活动之复活，不然不但纽约一州且全国之进步分子将感觉挫折。按前次美国产业工会联合会之政治行动委员会、全国公民政治行动委员会及科学艺术专业独立公民委员会等十七团体，曾组织“芝加哥进步分子联系委员会”，由产业工会联合会主席莫莱任主席。该会获得美国劳工党之支持，前罗斯福内阁阁员摩根索伊克斯及前经济稳定局局长鲍尔斯之参加该委员会，将于明年一月举行扩大会议。莫莱曾宣称：“我们希望于一九四七年中能使一切自由及进步分子都加入联系委员会。”一般估计，如华莱士及泼贝尔等组织第三党，极可能获得该委员会之支持。虽二氏目前并未参加该委员会，因该会目的在恢复罗斯福政策，故代表大资产阶级之自由党（系美劳工党中右派组成）。曾公开表示与该委员会无关，但该会将获得更广泛之支持则可预卜。
