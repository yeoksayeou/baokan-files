　　Farmers' Lives Continue to Improve
    Over 500 Households Rise in Status
    The reason why the first district of Licheng was able to achieve the above results this year is: First, agricultural technology has been improved, and intensive cultivation has been carried out. Each village has established a technical guidance committee to study the planting methods of King Queen corn and cotton. As a result, this year the King Queen corn can produce 2.4 shi per mu, and cotton can yield an average of 30 jin per mu. Last year, each mu could only use 25 loads of manure, but this year it generally reached 30 loads, and even 45 loads in eight villages including Nancun. Second, they made a fortune by planting a variety of special crops. The district planted a total of 8,334.5 mu of King Queen corn, which produced 7 dou more per mu than local corn, for a total increase of 583.38 shi; a total of 8,300.087 mu of cotton was planted, producing 1.5 shi more grain per mu than planting millet, for a total increase of 12,450 shi; a total of 36.7 mu of indigo was planted, producing 10 shi more per mu than planting millet, for a total increase of 367 shi; in total, the district produced an additional 13,400.038 shi due to planting special crops. No wonder old man Yang Zhonghe said, "One mu of indigo is worth ten mu of fields, don't you think we're making a fortune?" Third, the integration of agriculture and sideline occupations has been implemented throughout the year. Through precise calculations, surplus labor is extracted for sideline production. Women organize a large amount of weaving during the slack season, and participate in agricultural production during the busy season. Due to the great development of the production movement this year, farmers' incomes have increased significantly. As a result, the economic lives of many farmers have continued to improve. According to accurate statistics, this year another 218 poor peasant households in the district have risen to become middle peasants, 284 middle peasant households have risen to become well-to-do middle peasants, and 67 well-to-do middle peasant households have risen to become rich peasants.

　　农民生活继续提高
    五百多户成分上升
    今年黎城一区的生产所以能得到如上的成绩，是因为：一、提高了农业技术，进行了精耕细作。每个村都成立了技术指导委员会，研究了金皇后和棉花等庄稼的种植方法，因之，今年金皇后每亩能产两石四斗，棉花平均每亩能收三十斤。去年每亩只能上二十五驮粪，今年一般的上到三十驮，南村等八村更达四十五驮。二、多种特种庄稼发了财。全区共种金皇后八千三百三十四亩五，每亩比土玉茭增产七斗，共增产五百八十三石三斗八；共种棉花八千三百亩零八分七，比种谷每亩多产粮一石五斗，共多产一万二千四百五十石；共种靛三十六亩七，比种谷每亩多十石，共增产三百六十七石；总计，全区因种特种庄稼多产了一万三千四百石零三斗八。无怪杨中和老汉说：“一亩靛顶十亩田，你看发财不发财。”三、农副业结合贯彻了全年，通过精确计算，抽出剩余劳力进行副业生产。妇女们在农闲时，组织大量纺织，农忙时则参加农业生产。由于今年生产运动的大大开展，农民收入大量增加，因此，许多农民的经济生活继续上升，据精确的统计，今年全区又有二百十八户贫农上升为中农，二百八十四户中农上升为富裕中农，六十七户富裕中农上升为富农。（东生、任卿、廷壁、光弟）
