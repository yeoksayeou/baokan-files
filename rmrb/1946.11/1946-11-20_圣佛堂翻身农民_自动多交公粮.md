    【Report from this newspaper in Wei County, 14th】 Peasants in Shengfotang, Wei County, who have obtained land are enthusiastically contributing grain in a public grain delivery competition. Under the leadership of labor hero Shi Decai, the village recently convened a meeting of mutual aid teams to prepare public grain. At the meeting, Shi Decai said: Chiang Kai-shek is trying to take away our livelihood again. "Before the troops arrive, the provisions must go first." Without supplies, we cannot win battles. We must prepare the public grain well so that it is ready whenever the government needs it. I have already prepared my public grain and will over-deliver 80 catties. Geng Lanbi, director of the farmers' association, said: "My public grain is ready whenever needed, and I will also over-deliver 70 catties of mung beans." Jing Lan said: "We can't let the American devils come and rape Chinese women again! I would rather eat less myself, but the public grain must be delivered in full. In addition, I will over-deliver 30 catties of rice." Yang Shulin, director of the trade union, said: "Even if I have to eat bran and vegetables, I am willing to over-deliver 35 catties of grain to the front lines." After everyone finished talking about their preparations, they were divided into groups to discuss how to deliver. Shi Decai, representing the fifth team, said: "My team guarantees to deliver clean, high-quality grain, thresh the millet well, and help the elderly, weak, orphaned, and widowed with transportation." The ninth team said: "My cotton has hard bolls, and I guarantee to pick them out!" The other eight teams challenged the seventh team, and they are also preparing to discuss and elect public grain delivery models at the next meeting.

    圣佛堂翻身农民
    自动多交公粮
    【本报威县十四日电】威县圣佛堂获得土地的农民在竞赛交公粮中纷纷献粮。在劳动英雄石德才领导下，该村最近召开了互助大队准备公粮大会。会上石德才说：蒋介石又来打我们饭碗子。“兵马不到、粮草先行”，没为给养不能打胜仗。我们要把公粮准备好，政府一说就现成，我公粮早准备好了，除应交数外，多交八十斤。农会主任耿兰毕说：“我的公粮说拿就齐，另外多交七十斤绿豆”。景兰说：“不能再让美国鬼子来强奸中国的妇女呀！我宁愿自己少吃，公粮得交齐。另外我还多交三十斤米。”工会主任杨守林说：“吃点糠菜，我也愿意给前方多交三十五斤粮食。”各人把准备情形谈完，随即分组讨论如何交。石德才代表五班说：“我班保证交白花，谷子煽好，帮老弱孤寡搬运”。九班说：“我的棉花有硬瓣，我保证拣出来！”其他八个班都向七班挑战，他们还准备下次开会讨论选举交粮模范。
