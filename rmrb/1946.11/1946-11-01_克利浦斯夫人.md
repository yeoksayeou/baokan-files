　　Lady Cripps
　　Lady Cripps is one of the British women leaders and the president of the British United Aid to China Fund. Since its establishment in 1942, the Fund has raised more than 1.8 million pounds in donations, and more than 80 hospitals, educational institutions, and production agencies in China have been sponsored by the Fund. Our Peace Hospital in the border region has also received some donations. Lady Cripps is a social activist who loves the Chinese people. Since 1940, she has been actively committed to helping our suffering compatriots. As president of the Aid to China Fund, she has constantly called on the British people to donate generously. The 1.8 million pounds in funds are all the hard-earned money of the British people. For her meritorious service in the Aid to China Fund, the British Emperor awarded Lady Cripps with a Medal of Honour.
　　Lady Cripps was born into the aristocracy. Her husband is the Minister of Commerce, who is related to the post-war economic recovery of Britain today. He was once expelled from the Labour Party for advocating friendship with the Soviet Union; he rejoined the party last year. During the war, he served as Ambassador to the Soviet Union and Minister of Aircraft Production. Lady Cripps is not only an enthusiastic social activist but also a good helper to Sir Stafford Cripps.

　　克利浦斯夫人
    克利浦斯夫人是英国妇女领袖之一，英国统一援华基金委员会（又译“克夫人援华联合募款会”）会长。该会自一九四二年成立以来，共募集了一百八十余万英镑捐款，在中国受到该会赞助而设立的医院教育及生产机关共达八十余个之多。我们边区的和平医院也得到一部分捐款。克夫人是热爱中国人民的社会事业家，自一九四○年以来，即积极致力于援助我国苦难同胞的工作。任援华会会长时，更不断呼吁英国人民慷慨捐输，一百八十万镑基金都是英国人民的血汗。因负责援华会工作有功，英皇曾援克夫人以荣誉勋章。
    克夫人出身贵族，丈夫是今天关系英国战后经济复兴的商务大臣，曾一度因主张与苏联结好被工党开除过党籍；去年重新入党。战争期间，做过驻苏大使及飞机生产大臣。克夫人不但是一位热情的社会事业家，而且是克利浦斯爵士的贤内助。
