　　[This report from our correspondent in Weixian, 26th] The remnants of the pseudo-bandits Xie Huawu etc., entrenched in the first and third districts of the Plain Area, under the instigation of the Kuomintang reactionaries in Jinan and in collusion with local Chiang Kai-shek special agents and despotic landlords, have been carrying out grain robbery, assassinations, and military offensives against our districts. In order to remove obstacles to the emancipation of the masses, the local government, military, and civilians of the county have gathered their forces to encircle and suppress them and organized armed work teams to conduct activities deep in the pseudo-bandit areas. Over the past three months, they have continuously crushed the joint offensives of the pseudo-bandits Deng Xiec臣hen, Yuan Yanqiu, Xie Huawu, and the Kuomintang Shandong Fourth Special District Commissioner Tian Jimin, captured alive the pseudo-district chief of the Second District, Wang Fujing, and the pseudo-bandit leader Liu Baozhong, and destroyed many special agent organizations, seizing more than forty rifles and pistols. In the Second District alone, two hundred pseudo-bandits have confessed and repented to our government. Currently, the Third District continues to encircle and suppress the remnants of the pseudo-bandit Chen Lianqin, while other districts, in conjunction with the armed anti-espionage struggle, have rapidly shifted to a large-scale mass movement.

    【本报威县二十六日电】盘据平原一、三区的伪匪谢化五等残部在济南国民党反动派指使下，配合当地蒋特、恶霸地主向我各区进行抢粮、暗杀和军事进攻。该县当政军民，为扫除群众翻身障碍，乃集合兵力进行围剿并组织武工队深入伪匪区活动。三个月来，连续粉碎了伪匪邓协臣、袁砚秋、谢化五及国民党山东第四专区专员田纪明统一指挥的联合进攻，活捉伪二区区长王富景和伪匪头子刘保中，并摧毁了好多特务组织，缴获长短枪四十余支，仅二区伪匪向我政府坦白悔过者即达二百名。现三区仍继续围剿伪匪陈连琴残部，其他各区现已结合武装反特斗争，迅速转入大规模的群众运动。
