　　An'yang Chiang Troops Strafe Harvesting Masses
    Our Eight Hundred Brave Soldiers Armed to Help Harvest
    [This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch on the 31st] This month, our × unit, which was fighting in the An'yang front line in the areas of Dazhengji, Wanglou Village, and Mashui Village, responded to the military region's call and voluntarily helped the local masses with the autumn harvest. This area is located north of the Huan River, west of An'yang City, across the river from the Chiang Kai-shek and puppet troops, making it impossible to harvest the land along the riverbank. A few days ago, when the masses sent women to harvest, they were strafed by enemy machine guns, killing two people and two cattle, and injuring countless others. After the unit arrived, it immediately provided armed cover for the masses to go and harvest, and used eight hundred officers and soldiers and some warhorses to help with the rush harvest. The harvesting and autumn cultivation work, which had been delayed for a long time due to the disturbances of the Chiang Kai-shek and puppet troops, was completed in two days, with the unit alone completing more than 63 mu of plowing, 70 mu of hoeing, 18 mu of irrigation, and harvesting more than 40 mu of cotton and tobacco. They also helped carry grain and threshing. The masses were very moved and initiated support for the army, which the unit politely declined. (Liu Zhi)

　　安阳蒋军扫射收耕群众
    我八百健儿武装助收
    【本报长治三十一日电】本月中旬在安阳前线大正集、王楼村、麻水村一带作战之我×部队，响应军区号召，自动帮助当地群众秋收。该地在安阳城西洹河以北，隔河即为蒋伪军，以致河岸地带无法收割。日前群众以妇女前往收割，亦被敌机枪扫射，死人牛各二，伤者无数。该部到达后，立即以武装掩护群众前往收割，并以八百指战员及战马一部帮助抢收。该地因蒋伪扰乱迟误甚久的收割与秋耕工作，两日即全部完成，其中由该部单独完成者计刨地六十三亩余，锄地七十亩，浇地十八亩余，收棉花烟叶等四十余亩，并帮助担谷打场。群众十分感动发起拥军，亦为该部婉言辞谢。（刘志）
