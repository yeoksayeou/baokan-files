　　Great Power of Organization
    Lucheng's "Cultivate Three, Surplus One"
    [From our Changzhi Correspondent] On the fourth day of the Lucheng Hero Conference, County Head Zhao reported to all the heroes on the county's production summary for this year. When he spoke of the great achievement of a total increase of 380,000 shi in agricultural and sideline production in the county, all the heroes responded with warm applause, expressing their joy over the bumper harvest. Then he listed the specific figures of the increase in production. 1. In agriculture: "Golden Queen" increased production by 17,710 shi, "169" wheat and glutinous rice increased production by 457 shi, cotton increased production by 100,195 shi, millet increased production by 8,006 shi, peanuts increased production by 28,657 shi, water conservancy projects increased production by 1,945 shi, 7,309 mu of reclaimed wasteland, increased production by 5,116 shi, totaling 172,992 shi. 2. In handicrafts and sideline occupations, spinning and weaving earned foreign currency equivalent to 38,160 shi, straw hats, etc., earned foreign currency equivalent to 13,501 shi, cooperatives earned foreign currency equivalent to 5,547 shi, saltpeter earned foreign currency equivalent to 153,000 shi, totaling 200,208 shi. The total increase in grain production from agriculture and sideline occupations was 383,200 shi. The total income from agriculture and sideline occupations was 1,195,252 shi. With a total population of 121,342, the average grain per person was 9 shi, 8 dou, and 5 sheng, and the entire county has achieved "cultivate three, surplus one." Weijiazhuang is a model village in the county. The whole village has achieved "cultivate one, surplus two." Calculated by household, 131 households have achieved "cultivate one, surplus three," 16 households "cultivate one, surplus two," 32 households "cultivate one, surplus one," 16 households "cultivate three, surplus one," and 6 households "cultivate two, surplus three." Nanliu is a medium-sized village (representing 21 villages), and the whole village has achieved "cultivate three, surplus one." Huangchi is a relatively poor village (representing 45 villages), and the whole village has achieved "cultivate three, surplus one." Finally, County Head Zhao pointed out that the reason why such significant achievements have been made in this year's increase in production is closely related to further organization, in addition to the above-mentioned combination of various special crops and sideline occupations. This year, a total of 3,265 mutual aid groups have been organized in 190 villages in the county, with 26,412 households, accounting for 82 percent of the total number of households, with a total labor force of 66,981 people, accounting for 55 percent of the original population.
