    Zuoquan No. 1 High School Propaganda Team
    Deeply Engages in Current Affairs Propaganda
    [This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch] In order to thoroughly expose the Chiang-American conspiracy, universally mobilize the masses, and strive for the victory of a comprehensive resistance, the teachers and students of Zuoquan No. 1 High School have organized four propaganda teams to cooperate with village cadres to conduct propaganda in four mountain villages, namely Caotinggou, Zhangbagou, Wangyangnao, and Zhangbacun. Each team consists of six students, one teacher, and three village cadres. After arriving in the village, the teacher and village cadres are responsible for writing slogans and mobilizing the militia to study. Two male students are specifically responsible for organizing children's learning, organizing all out-of-school children in the village, selecting children's leaders to form a study committee, and leading the children to study regularly. The female students are responsible for teaching songs and organizing women to discuss current affairs. The other two male students organize men to study. On the first afternoon, they held a general meeting of the people in the entire mountain gully to explain the current situation. In order not to delay production, the elderly were organized to discuss current affairs in the morning, women were organized to study in the afternoon, and men were organized into groups to discuss in the evening. During the discussion, everyone unanimously recognized that old Chiang was betraying the country and colluding with the United States to fight the people, and that the Eighth Route Army would definitely be able to defeat their joint offensive. They unanimously decided to actively practice martial arts and step up support for the front lines.
