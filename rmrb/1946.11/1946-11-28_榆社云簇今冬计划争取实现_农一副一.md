　　Yushe Yuncun Plans to Strive for "One Subsidiary Occupation to One Agriculture" This Winter

　　[Reported by this newspaper] In order to carry out winter production, Yuncun in the third district of Yushe, based on the village's circumstances, proposed the slogan "One Subsidiary Occupation to One Agriculture." Now, all men, women, young and old in the village are working hard to complete this plan. In this year's great production campaign, the masses have greatly benefited from paying attention to the development of sideline occupations. The entire village earned more than 2.8 million yuan, which can buy more than 2,800 *shi* of grain at market prices (1,000 yuan per *shi*), accounting for two-thirds of the annual agricultural income. Because sideline production has flourished, even lazy people like Cao Sanman and idlers like Lei Zhanglong have changed, actively engaging in production and business, looking radiant, and wearing new clothes this winter. The masses happily said, "Rely on the mountain if you live near the mountain, rely on the water if you live near the water. Our village has made a fortune by relying on sideline occupations, which is equivalent to a season's harvest." Based on specific calculations, proposing one subsidiary occupation to one agriculture has further clarified everyone's direction of effort. All male and female laborers in the village are gathered around the mutual aid societies and are organized. Men are collecting firewood and manure and working in workshops, women are spinning wool and weaving cloth, and all livestock are being prepared for large-scale transportation. Ren Wenbi's Mao Mao team, ten people worked for twenty days and earned a net profit of 23,000 yuan, excluding food and drink. Ren Huoyuan, a sixty-year-old man, said, "With more people, there is more strength, and accumulation adds up. As long as we work hard to make money, why worry about achieving one subsidiary occupation to one agriculture?" Currently, winter production is being carried out enthusiastically in the village.

　　榆社云簇今冬计划争取实现“农一副一”
    【本报讯】榆社三区云簇为开展冬季生产，根据本村情况计算提出：“一副一农”的口号，现全村男女老幼都为完成这一计划而努力。在今年大生产运动中，因注意发展了副业，群众得到很大利益。全村共赚洋二百八十余万元，按市价可买粮二千八百余石，（每石一千元），占全年农业收入的三分之二。由于副业生产沾了大光，连赖汉曹三蛮、二流子雷掌龙，也转变过来，积极生产闹买卖，吃的红光满面，今冬穿上了新衣裳。群众们高兴的说：“靠山吃山靠水吃水，咱村靠副业发了大财，顶住一季收成”。根据具体计算提出一副一农，这样更明确了大家的努力方向，全村男女劳力都围绕着互助社，纷纷组织起来。男人打柴拾粪闹作坊，女人们纺毛纺线织布，全部畜力，准备大量组织运输。任文弼毛毛队，十个人闹了二十天，除吃喝外净赚洋二万三千元。六十老汉任火元说：“人多力量大，积少成多，从动弹闹钱，还愁做到农一副一吗？”现该村冬季生产正在热烈开展着。（周文郁、石光）
