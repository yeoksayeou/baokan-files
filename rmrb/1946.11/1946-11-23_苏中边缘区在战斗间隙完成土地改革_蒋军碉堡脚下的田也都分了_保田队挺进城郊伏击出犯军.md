Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 20th—The Jingjiang Dongxing District in the southern border area of Central Jiangsu, located between the Yang(zhou) Tai(xing) Highway and Chiang Kai-shek's strongholds such as Bawagang, and the Chiang-occupied areas in the suburbs of Taixing City, all completed the land reform movement in ten days during the breaks between Chiang Kai-shek's "sweeps." The suburbs of cities such as Rugao, Jingjiang, and Nantong were completed in three days under the cover of the turning-over teams, and even the fields at the foot of Chiang Kai-shek's pillboxes were distributed. When land reform was underway in Jingjiang Dongxing District, farmers at the foot of a certain Chiang Kai-shek pillbox swam across the river to request help in turning themselves over. After the farmers turned themselves over, they all launched a struggle to protect the land and persist in their original locations. The guerrilla force formed after land reform in a certain district of Rugao heroically defended itself, preventing the Chiang Kai-shek troops across the river from daring to harass them and preventing the establishment of the Chiang-puppet regime. A certain Chiang Kai-shek appointed Baochang (local head) in a certain township, after working for Chiang Kai-shek for three days, returned to the masses to confess his guilt. The land protection teams in border areas such as Jiangdu and Gaoyou advanced to the suburbs to ambush the raiding Chiang Kai-shek troops.

　　苏中边缘区在战斗间隙完成土地改革
    蒋军碉堡脚下的田也都分了
    保田队挺进城郊伏击出犯军
    【新华社华中二十日电】苏中南线边缘扬（州）泰（兴）公路与八圩港等蒋军据点间的靖江东兴区，及泰兴城郊的蒋占区，均在蒋军“扫荡”间隙十天中全部完成土地改革运动。如皋、靖江、南通等城郊，在翻身队掩护下三天内完成，连蒋军碉堡脚下的田也都分了。当靖江东兴区进行土地改革时，某处蒋军碉堡脚下的农民游过河来请求帮助他们翻身。农民翻身后，均为保田展开坚持原地斗争。如皋某区土地改革后组成之游击队英勇自卫，使隔河蒋军不敢出扰，蒋伪政权无法建立。某乡蒋记保长替蒋军作了三天事，便又回来向群众悔过。江都、高邮等边缘区保田队则挺进城郊，伏击出扰蒋军。
