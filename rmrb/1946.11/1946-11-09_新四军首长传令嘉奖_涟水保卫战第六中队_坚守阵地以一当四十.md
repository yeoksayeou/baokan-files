Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 5th: Chen Youfen, company commander of the Yangji District Participation Regiment in Guanyun, and nineteen immortal militiamen heroes including Zhu Xike and Yang Guohua, wrote an epic of the people's heroic resistance against the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops with their lives. At dawn on October 16th, the nineteen heroes were surrounded by more than 200 Chiang Kai-shek troops, more than ten times their number, at Xiaowei Village on the Jie圩 River bank south of Yangji. In four hours of fierce fighting, they repelled five assaults by the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops. With only ten bullets and four grenades left, after discussion, they extended several broken guns from the window, falsely claiming to "surrender." When the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops swarmed forward to "accept the surrender," they threw the last bullets and grenades, blasting the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops into a bloody mess. Taking advantage of the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops' panic, the brave men, gripping the gun barrels with broken parts, some even bare-handed, rushed out and engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops, inflicting casualties on them. At the same time, they shouted, "The people of the Liberated Area will never surrender, even if they die!" Company commander Chen Youfen, when shot and falling to the ground, still shouted, "Long live the Communist Party!" After exacting a heavy price, eighteen heroes made heroic sacrifices. One brave man, Lao Li, killed three Chiang Kai-shek soldiers with four bullets before falling to the ground wounded, feigning death to escape danger.

　　新四军首长传令嘉奖
    涟水保卫战第六中队
    坚守阵地以一当四十
    【新华社华中五日电】灌云杨集区参战团连长陈幼奋和朱息科、杨国华等十九位不朽的民兵英雄，以他们的生命、写下了人民英勇抗击蒋伪军的可歌可泣的史诗。十九位英雄，在十月十六日拂晓，被超过自己十余倍的蒋军二百余人包围于杨集以南界圩河岸上的小圩庄上，在四小时激战中，打垮了蒋伪军的五次冲锋。只剩下十发子弹和四颗手榴弹了，经过商议后，他们从窗口伸出几枝破枪诈称：“投降”。当蒋伪军蜂拥前来“受降”时，他们投射出最后的子弹和炸弹，把蒋伪军炸的血肉横飞，趁着蒋伪军惊惶失措之际，勇士们紧握着折掉了零件的枪筒，有的竟赤手空拳冲出来和蒋伪军肉搏，又予蒋伪军以杀伤，同时高呼“解放区人民死也不会投降”！连长陈幼奋被击中倒地时，还高呼“共产党万岁”！在索取重大代价后，十八位勇士作了壮烈牺牲，一位勇士老李，用四颗子弹打死三名蒋军后，负伤倒地，装死脱险。
