Rampant Land Tax and Military Grain Deliveries Force the Hungry to Cry Out in the Streets!

　　According to the Shanghai Qiaosheng Daily on the 8th, hunger riots have continuously occurred in Yongjia (Wenzhou), Zhejiang. At about 7 p.m. on October 27th, groups of people, pale and ragged, were suddenly spotted in the east and west gate areas, dragging kerosene cans and shouting along the way, "Strike! Strike! We have nothing to eat!" The shouts here echoed the rumbling of kerosene cans there, causing great chaos in the city. By 8 p.m., the riot had spread to the city center and various busy streets, with many groups of hungry people taking the same action, each group numbering from three or four hundred to five or six hundred people. For a time, shops and theaters were all closed, and rice grabbing incidents also occurred. The police lazily watched the hungry crowds and fired blank shots. Representatives from gentry and business circles rushed to the special commissioner's office, saying anxiously, "The problem is serious! It's terrible!" The deputy commander of the Security Force also said the same. A similar incident occurred in Rui'an on the morning of the 26th. Hungry people also dragged kerosene cans and marched in groups, shouting, "We want food! We can't live like this!" The reason for the riots was the high price of rice. The price of rice in both places had risen to 10,000 yuan for 17 catties. The rice harvest of farmers in the countryside this year was not only hit by drought and wind, but also burdened with heavy land taxes, military grain deliveries, and exorbitant rents.

Bitter Weather, Scanty Clothing—Workers and Employees Launch Uprisings!

　　According to the Tianjin Dagong Daily on the 11th, all 400-plus employees of the National Highway Administration of the Ministry of Transportation in Nanjing jointly appealed to the director for a loan of 500,000 yuan for winter clothing due to the cold weather and lack of clothes. Unexpectedly, Director Fang Zhaohao was not at all concerned and, in a fit of anger, ordered "dismissal of all". All the employees were extremely indignant upon hearing the news, brewing a serious storm.

　　According to the Tianjin Dagong Daily on the 15th, a strike broke out at the Chongqing Shaanxi Textile Factory, which employs 7,000 workers, on the 13th of this month. The reason was that the workers asked the factory to provide winter clothes to keep warm, but were refused.

Discarded Officers Refuse to Die and Find an Outlet in Popular Uprising Forces!

　　According to a Junwenshe [Military News Agency] dispatch embedded in the Tianjin Dagong Daily on November 7th, the Ministry of National Defense has explicitly ordered KMT military and political organs in various places to adopt high-handed measures against non-direct-line demobilized officers. All those who "arbitrarily organize groups and elect representatives to petition shall be strictly suppressed and dispersed by the military and police organs, and their representatives shall be detained, strictly investigated, and punished according to law." This move will inevitably provoke greater resistance from the vast number of demobilized officers. Recently, large numbers of demobilized officers in Sichuan, Hunan, Suzhou, and other places have poured into the popular uprising armed forces to directly resist the Jiang family's tyranny.

　　The Tianjin Dagong Daily revealed on the 10th of this month that popular uprising armed forces near Hankou have continuously attacked KMT military vehicles. On the 4th of this month, six rebels disguised as pedestrians ambushed six KMT military vehicles departing from a certain location to Hankou near Cai Dian Town, 50 li from Hankou, seizing four pistols and two Zhongzheng rifles from the escorting soldiers. Several days before this, they also intercepted six KMT air force military vehicles near Cai Dian in succession.

American Military Atrocities Continue to Unfold—When Will This Blood Debt Be Repaid?

　　On the night of the 17th, Tianjin rickshaw puller Liu Yuting was hired by an American soldier to go from a nightclub to the American military camp on Dihua Road. The American soldier punched and kicked the rickshaw puller along the way. At the entrance of the camp, he pulled the rickshaw puller down and beat him violently until the rickshaw puller vomited blood, lay on the ground speechless, and then entered the camp. That same afternoon, an American military jeep No. 76108 on Nanjing Road in Tianjin crashed into and injured a young woman. In Beijing on the 18th, at noon, a person resembling a shop assistant was riding a bicycle past Xidan North Street when an American Navy truck No. 65681 drove forward rapidly, rolling the cyclist under the wheels and dragging him for five meters. The person's head was already smashed, and blood was flowing all over the ground. That same day, in the evening, police officer Liu Zhiqi of the 7th Precinct was riding a bicycle past the east entrance of Jiaomin Lane when he was knocked down by an American military armored truck No. 102067, and his ankle was broken.

　　According to the Tianjin Dagong Daily on the 9th, on the afternoon of the 2nd of this month, Qingdao merchants Lu Shouyu and his companions Dou Xintai and others were driven into the American military camp on Guizhou Road by two American soldiers under the pretense of selling old gasoline drums and other items. After being thoroughly searched, forty-two US dollars and other cash were all robbed. Lu immediately argued with them and was shot by an American soldier, killing Lu instantly and injuring Dou's leg.

　　According to the Huaxi Evening News on October 18th, American soldiers in Qingdao treated explosions as child's play, arbitrarily killing and injuring pedestrians. One day in mid-October, when an American military vehicle was traveling on the street, the American soldiers on the vehicle dropped a detonating cap, killing a four-year-old child, whose brains and intestines were blown out. Soon after, a second explosion occurred.

Taiwanese Sugarcane is Sweet as Honey—the Red-Haired Robbers Want to Snatch It Away.

　　The greedy hands of American imperialism are stretching towards China's sugar industry. According to a Central News Agency report: American sugar industry delegation leader Bradys arrived in Taipei by plane from Shanghai on the 14th to study Taiwanese sugarcane varieties.

For Fear of Freezing the Big Traitors, Airplanes Transport Cotton Clothes.

　　According to Pingjin [Beijing and Tianjin] newspapers, the Jiang government in North China is treating traitors with extreme favor. For example, Wang Yitang, the number one traitor in North China, was sentenced to death, but because the presiding judge who sentenced him was also a big traitor, he was accused by Wang and the matter was shelved. Zhang Qiuqing, the vice president of the big traitorous "Xinminhui" [New People's Society], was acquitted. Due to public outrage, he was reluctantly arrested and imprisoned again. When the big traitors Wang Yintai, Pan Yugui, and 13 others were transported from Ping to the capital, it was the height of summer and they had not brought warm clothes. When the weather turned cooler in September, the authorities, deeply concerned about the traitors, rushed to send them six large packages of cotton clothes by airplane.

Many Japanese Women in Changchun—KMT Soldiers Marry Them as Wives.

　　According to a statistic, 1,180 Japanese women in Changchun have married KMT military and political personnel. However, many Japanese women have recently filed for divorce, either due to unbearable abuse or conflicts with former wives. It is said that the Municipal Police Department is overwhelmed by this. Brothels are rampant in Changchun. Now, a concentrated prostitute camp called "Gele Di" resembling a small city, has been specially built in the southeast corner of the city. It is surrounded by gray brick walls with four gates in the east, west, south, and north. Inside the city are more than 50 brothels with more than 700 prostitutes. The KMT officers and soldiers spend their days mingling here.

There Are Many Strange Things in the KMT-Controlled Areas—It is Impossible to Describe Them All in a Short Space.

　　Li Kuangxi, a judicial adjudicator in Suixian County, Guangxi, raped a female prisoner, causing the county councilors to be unable to bear it any longer and openly discuss the matter in the meeting.

　　In the rampant drug trafficking in Tianjin, several members of the "anus drug transport team" have been discovered, specializing in secretly transporting drugs through the anus.

　　蒋管区拾零
    田赋军粮交相迫，饥民行列街头呼！
    八日沪侨声报载，浙江永嘉（温州）连续发生饥民骚动。十月二十七日晚七时许，东西门一带突然发现一队一队面黄衣破的人，拖着洋油箱，沿途高呼“罢市！罢市！我们没有饭吃！”这里的叫喊声，那里的隆隆洋油箱震动声，互相呼应，市街秩序大乱。至八时，骚动风潮蔓延至市中心及各热闹街道，许多饥民队伍作同样行动，每队三四百人、五六百人不等，一时商店戏院尽行闭门，抢米事件亦曾发生。警察懒洋洋地望着饥民队伍打空枪。绅商各界齐奔专署，紧张地说：“问题严重，不得了！”保安副司令也如是说。瑞安则于二十六日上午发生同样事件。饥民也拖着洋油箱结队游行，高呼：“我们要饭吃啊！这样日子活不下去了！”骚动原因都为米价高涨。两地米价均卖到每万元十七斤，乡间农民今年的稻谷，除遭旱灾风外，又缴纳苛重的田赋军粮和重租。
    天寒衣单怎么好？工人职员起风潮。
    据十一日天津大公报称：南京国民党交通部公路总局全体职员四百余人，因天寒衣单，联合吁请局长借支寒衣费五十万元。不料局长方兆镐颇不为然，于威怒之下批以“一律遣散”，全体职员闻讯莫不愤慨异常，酝酿起严重风潮。
    据十五日天津大公报载，拥有七千工人的重庆陕纱厂本月十三日发生罢工风潮。原因为工人要求厂方发给冬衣御寒，遭到拒绝。
    被弃军官不甘死，民变队里找出路。
    据十一月七日天津大公报嵌军闻社消息：国防部已明令各地国民党军政机关，对非嫡系的编余军官采高压手段。凡“任意组织团体，推举代表请愿者，应由各军警机关严格取缔，予以驱散，并将其代表扣留，严予查讯，依法惩办。”此举势将激起广大编余军官更大反抗。四川、湖南、苏州等地，最近已有大批编余军官涌入民变武装，直接反抗蒋家暴政。
    本月十日天津大公报透露：汉口附近民变武装连续袭击国民党军车。本月四日有化装行路人的变民六名，在距汉口五十华里的蔡甸镇附近拦击由某地开出汉口的国民党军车六辆，缴获押车士兵的手枪四支，中正式步枪两支。前此数日，亦在蔡甸附近连续截击国民党空军方面军车六辆。
    美军暴行演不断，这笔血债何时还？
    十七日夜津市三轮车夫刘玉亭拉一美军由夜总会赴迪化道美军军营，美军沿途对车夫拳打脚踢，至营盘门口又将军夫拉下毒打，直至该车夫口吐鲜血，卧地不语，始入营内。同日下午天津南京路美军七六一○八号吉普车横冲直撞，将一青年女子撞伤。在北平十八日正午有形似商店伙计者骑车经过西单北大街时，美海军卡车六五六八一号急驶前进，将骑车者卷入车下，拖行达五米远，该人头部业已撞坏，血流满地。同日晚七分局警察刘植琦骑车经西交民巷东口时，被美军一○二○六七号巨型装甲卡车撞倒，脚腕被撞断。
    据天津大公报九日载：本月二日下午，青岛商民鲁守玉及其伙友窦新泰等四人，被美兵二人以出售旧汽油筒等物名义，驱入贵州路美军兵营内，遍遭搜索，美金四十二元等其他现款悉被抢去，鲁即与之争执，遭美兵枪击，鲁当即毙命，窦腿部受伤。
    据十月十八日华西晚报载，青岛美军以爆炸为儿戏，随意毙伤行人。十月中旬某日一美军用汽车行经街道时，车上美军丢下爆炸性雷管一枚，一四岁小孩被炸死，脑浆肠子都炸了出来；且不久又发生第二次爆炸事件。
    台湾甘蔗甜如蜜，红毛强盗想夺去。
    美帝国主义贪婪的手掌，又伸向中国的糖业。据中央社讯：美国糖业考察团长勃莱迭斯十四日由沪飞抵台北，将研究台湾蔗种。
  唯恐冻坏大汉奸，飞机运送棉衣裳。
    据平津报载蒋政府在华北对汉奸极度优待，如华北第一号大汉奸王揖唐，虽判死刑，但因判刑之裁判厅厅长亦系巨奸，被王逆控告，而竟搁浅不问。大汉奸“新民会”副会长张求卿竟被判无罪，因群情大哗，不得已又予逮捕入狱。巨奸王荫泰、潘毓桂等十三人由平运京时正值盛暑，未带寒衣。九月天气转凉，当局体念汉奸情深，赶忙用飞机为他们运去棉衣六大包。
    长春日本女人多，蒋军讨来做老婆。
    长春日本女人与蒋方军政人员结婚者，据一统计称，已有一千一百八十人。但日女近多纷纷提出离婚，原因或系不堪蹂躏虐待或系与前妻内哄，闻市警局对此不胜其烦云。长春妓馆充斥，现在城东南角专门建筑了一处妓女集中营，名叫“歌乐地”好像一座小城，四周用灰砖筑成围墙，东西南北四座门，城内五十多家妓馆，七百多个妓女。国民党的官兵，成天在这里鬼混。
    蒋区怪事多多多，纸短话长说不完。
    广西绥县司法审判官李匡熙强奸女犯引得县参议员们亦忍无可忍，在会上公开讨论此事。
    天津大贩毒声中，已发现“肛门运毒队”队员多人，专以肛门从事秘密运送毒品。
