　　Shaan-Gan-Ning Border Region Government Instruction
    Winter School Combined with Self-Defense Army Winter Training
    [Our Special Dispatch] The Shaan-Gan-Ning Border Region Government issued instructions on winter school work in the middle of last month. The instructions stated: (1) At a time when the flames of civil war are sweeping the country, and the border region is also under the threat of war, mobilizing all the people to strengthen war preparedness has become the center of all work. Therefore, this year's winter school should be closely integrated with the winter training of the self-defense army. In terms of teaching content, current affairs education should be given equal importance as literacy education, combined with some self-defense and anti-espionage training. Responsible comrades at all levels should go to the winter school in a planned way to talk about current affairs, try to attract local people to listen, to enhance the masses' confidence in the victory of the war, and can invite local garrison or militia cadres to talk about some necessary military knowledge, or invite people who understand Chinese martial arts to teach martial arts, to strengthen the strength of defending the border region. (2) According to the specific situation and possible conditions of each county, plan the areas where winter schools should be held, assign cadres to go deep into the countryside to grasp the activists among the masses to promote the general masses, persuade the passive elements, and after democratic deliberation and discussion, everyone should start to run the winter schools well. The leadership (especially the district and township governments) should always pay attention to checking and, with the help of the masses, solve the difficulties of the winter schools. (3) According to the winter school experience of last year, the one-stop winter school form is most welcomed by the masses. For example, in Wuqi County last year, several winter schools, in addition to being divided into morning, noon, evening, and half-day classes for timely teaching, were also supplemented by a learn-as-you-go method, which neither delayed production nor prevented education. Also, last winter, Zhidan and Wuqi counties created mobile winter schools, divided into groups by location, with teachers rotating, which was convenient for the masses, and is worth learning from and greatly promoting. The instruction emphasized the need to solve the teacher problem well. In addition to the special commissioner's office consulting with the normal school to transfer some students to teach, each county and city's complete primary schools, primary and secondary people's education centers should set up winter school classes, and cadres of county agencies and troops can run winter schools near their stations. Before the winter schools start, each county should hold a three-day winter school teacher seminar, taking the county or district as a unit, to clarify the principles and specific methods.

　　陕甘宁边区政府指示
    冬学与自卫军冬训结合
    【本报特讯】陕甘宁边区政府于上月中旬发出冬学工作指示，指示内称：（一）当此内战烈火烧遍了全国，边区亦处在战争威胁之下，动员全体人民加强备战，成为一切工作的中心。因此今年的冬学就要与自卫军的冬训密切结合，在教学内容上时事教育应与识字教育并重，配合若干自卫防奸的训练。各级负责同志，应有计划地到冬学去讲时事，尽量吸收当地群众来听，以提高群众对战争胜利的信心，并可邀请当地驻军或民兵干部去讲一些必要的军事常识，或请懂得国术的教援武术，以加强保卫边区的实力。（二）按照各县的具体情况和可能条件，计划出应该举办冬学的地区，分配干部深入农村抓住群众中的积极分子推动一般群众，说服消极分子，经过民主酝酿和讨论，大家动手办好冬学。领导上（特别是区乡政府）要经常注意检查和经过群众帮助解决冬学的困难。（三）根据去年冬学经验，一揽子的冬学形式，最为群众所欢迎，如吴旗县去年有几处冬学，除编为早班、午班、晚班、半日班按时实行分班教学外，还辅以随到随教方式，既不耽误生产，又能进行教育。又如志丹吴旗两县去冬还创立了巡回冬学，分地编组，教员轮教，便利于群众，值得取法和大大推广。该指示着重指出要很好解决教师问题，除专署就近与师范中学商量抽调一部分学生任教外，各县市完小、中小民教馆附设冬学班，各县机关部队的干部可在驻地附近办冬学。各县于冬学开学前，以县或区为单位，开三几天冬学教员座谈会，把方针和具体办法研究清楚。
