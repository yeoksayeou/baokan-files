　　Typical Backward Village Finally Achieves Breakthrough
　　Dongyangguan Re-Investigates Rent Reduction to Realize "Land to the Tiller"
　　[Our Dispatch] Dongyangguan in the Third District of Licheng County, after a 50-day rent reduction movement from early September to the end of October, has realized "land to the tiller". Dongyangguan village has more than 500 households and more than 1,300 people, with more than 6,700 mu of land (including more than 500 mu of public land). In 1942 and 1944, rent reduction and re-investigations were carried out successively, but the peasants did not completely liberate themselves. According to the investigation: there were nine landlords, fifteen managing landlords, and twenty-eight feudal rich peasants, a total of fifty-two households, occupying more than 1,650 mu of land. More than 140 households of poor peasants, farm laborers, and veterans did not have land or did not have enough land to cultivate. In politics, special agents were still active, constantly creating threats to the peasants. Therefore, the work in this village has always been backward.
　　Before the autumn harvest, the county specially selected Dongyangguan as one of the experimental villages, first conducting a very detailed investigation and research. The method was to visit and register households below the poor peasant level, and understand their economic situation and the exploitation of them by feudal forces from the registration. During the interviews and registration, it was discovered that poor peasants and farm laborers were not interested in rent and interest reduction. They said: "We reduced rent twice in 1942 and 1944, but we not only did not completely turn ourselves over, but also wasted a lot of work." It was first decided to completely eliminate feudalism, everyone would struggle, and everyone would be liberated, with the principle of "filling the gully first and then leveling the ground". Then, a mobilization meeting of village cadres and activists, and mobilization meetings of small groups in various streets and alleys were held. After three or four days of preparation, the masses' fighting spirit was already high, and many problems were discovered. Successive mass grievance meetings were held. At the meetings, the masses raised more than 250 questions. In order not to delay the autumn harvest, the leadership decided on various methods such as holding large-scale struggles and alley-based struggles, harvesting during the day to prepare, and holding meetings and struggles at night. Also, because the targets of the struggle were different, it was decided to use both struggle and mediation methods. For example, for special agent landlord Jia Gonggan, etc., the method of large-scale struggle was adopted. For Shi Jiayan and others, whose problems were small and the circumstances were minor, the method of alley-based mediation was adopted. After more than 50 days of movement, a total of 23 households of special agent landlords and despots were overthrown, and the masses recovered more than 900 mu of land, 336 houses, and 139 shi of grain. All 394 households of poor peasants, middle peasants, and veterans in the village gained fruits, with an average of more than four mu of land per person. After the masses turned themselves over, the militia expanded from 56 people to 101 people. Strengthened military training.

　　典型落后村终于突破
    东阳关再次查减实现耕者有其田
    【本报讯】黎城三区东阳关经过九月上旬到十月底共五十天的查减运动，已实现了耕者有其田。东阳关全村五百余户，一千三百多人，有六千七百多亩土地（内有公地五百多亩）。四二、四四年，曾先后进行减租及查减，农民没有彻底翻身。据调查：全村地主九户，经营地主十五户，封建富农二十八户，共五十二户，占有土地一千六百五十多亩。贫雇农及荣退军人一百四十多户没有土地或土地不够种。在政治上特务仍然活动，不断造成威胁农民。因此该村工作始终是落后的。
    秋收前，县里特选定东阳关为试验村之一，先作很详细的调查研究，方法是对贫农以下户作访问登记。从登记中，了解他的经济情况及封建势力对他们的压榨。在访问登记中，发现了贫雇农，对减租减息不感兴趣。他们说：“四二、四四年减过两次租，我们不但没翻透身，而且误了不少工”。首先决定彻底消灭封建，大家斗争，大家翻身，“先填圪塔后补平”的方针。接着召开了村干部积极分子动员大会，各街各巷的小组动员会，经过三四天酝酿，群众斗争情绪已较高涨，并发现了不少问题。接连召开群众诉苦大会，会上群众先后提出问题二百五十余件，领导上为不耽误秋收，决定大会斗争及分巷斗争，白天秋收酝酿，晚上开会斗争等种种方法。又因斗争对象不同，决定用斗争与调解两种办法。如对特务地主贾公干等，即采用了大会斗争的方法。对于问题较小、情节较轻的史嘉言等采取了分巷调解的方法。经过五十来天的运动，计摧垮特务地主恶霸二十三户，群众收回土地九百多亩，房屋三百三十六间，粮食一百三十九石。全村三百九十四户贫雇中农及荣退军人均获得果实，每人平均有了四亩多土地。群众翻身后，民兵由五十六人扩大到一百零一人。加紧练武。
