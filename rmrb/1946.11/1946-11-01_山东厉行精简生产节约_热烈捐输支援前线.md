　　Shandong Liberated Area, at all levels of government and among individuals, is universally implementing production and thrift, enthusiastically donating materials to support the self-defense front lines. The Provincial Government has established a Production and Thrift Committee, deciding that all provincial-level units will be self-sufficient in office miscellaneous expenses, saving 10 million yuan. Mass organizations at all levels throughout the area are practicing austerity, with personnel remaining on duty performing the work of two people. The Binhai District Post Office staff has been reduced from 1,978 to 586 people, while the 4,000 li of postal routes throughout the district remain open. The Binhai Commissioner's Office strictly implements the supply certificate system, and in the past six months has produced and become self-sufficient for more than 8.25 million yuan, and has universally saved one pair of shoes. The Commissioner's Office and Linyi County Government, etc., have saved more than 46,000 jin of grain. The Xinhua Bookstore Three Factories saved one-third of their oil in August, while work efficiency increased by half. Workers automatically gathered to decide to donate one-third of their salary each month until the victory of the self-defense war. The factory has established its own vegetable garden, mill, cooperative, and transportation team. Female workers have established textile and sewing groups, striving for self-sufficiency in food and clothing. The Logistics Department of the Lunan Military Region has saved more than 10,000 jin of grain. Personnel in the Zhao (Xin County, the northern part of the original Pi County) district governments each cultivate nine mu of land, guaranteeing self-sufficiency in office expenses. The entire village of Taohuaping in Yishui County donated 260 jin of newly harvested cotton. Luzzhong labor heroes Zhu Fusheng, Wang Duiyi, Dong Tinghui, and others also each sent 10 jin of new cotton to frontline soldiers for sewing clothes to keep warm, and attached letters of comfort saying, "We feel cold in the morning and evening, and we think you should be wearing cotton clothes."
