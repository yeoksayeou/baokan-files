Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 7th. The Binhai Eighth Route Army, with lightning speed, liberated Anqiu city on the afternoon of the 5th. In this battle, over 2,500 Chiang and puppet troops of the First Division of the Shandong Security Forces were captured alive. Chiang puppet regiment commander Shen Jiemin, battalion commander Qin Gongchang, and over 500 others were killed or wounded. Over ten mortars, over ten light and heavy machine guns, and over 3,000 long and short guns were seized. Detailed battle results are being tallied. Anqiu city suffered from the enemy's scourge for eight years. After the victory against Japan, the puppet Independent 5th Regiment and the troops of Zhang Nitianzuo and others, who occupied the city, were re-appointed by the Kuomintang reactionaries as the First Division of the Shandong Security Forces, continuing to oppress the people. This liberation has allowed the people to see the light of day again, and they are celebrating wildly.

　　滨海我军解放安邱
    毙俘蒋伪三千余人
    【新华社山东七日电】滨海八路军以迅雷之势，于五日下午解放安邱城。是役生俘蒋伪军山东保安第一师所部，两千五百余人，毙伤蒋伪团长沈洁民，营长秦拱昌以下五百余人，缴获迫击炮十余门，轻重机枪十余挺、长短枪三千余枝，详细战果正清查中。安邱城遭敌寇荼毒八年，抗战胜利后盘据该城之伪独立五团及张逆天佐等部，复被国民党反动派加委为山东保安第一师，继续鱼肉人民，此次光复，人民重见天日，欢庆如狂。
