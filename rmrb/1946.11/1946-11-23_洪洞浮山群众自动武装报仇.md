　　【This newspaper Yangcheng, 19th dispatch】The Chiang Kai-shek troops occupying Hongdong and Fushan are even more barbaric and cruel than before in their rape, arson, and murder. Not only have ordinary, unarmed peasants suffered, but even Kuomintang secret agents have been unable to escape. The mother, aunt, and daughter-in-law of Li Kuisheng, a Kuomintang secret agent in Yangbao Village, Hongdong, were all raped by Chiang Kai-shek's troops. Old Mrs. Ji Luo tearfully complained to our district chief, "I can't live anymore. The Central Army is no good; they are very bad! They raped my daughter-in-law alive and beat me with gun butts..." The district chief also met the old lady's daughter-in-law, who cried sadly and said, "I want to find the Eighth Route Army to avenge me. The Central Army has bullied me so much that I can't live." Chiang Kai-shek's troops stayed in Xucun, Fushan, for three days. On the 21st of last month alone, five women were raped. The losses of the masses were even more severe. In three days, Chiang Kai-shek's troops stole ninety-eight sheep, ninety-seven chickens, two hundred and five dan of grain, and many items of clothing. Because of the inhumane actions of Chiang Kai-shek's troops, the masses have spontaneously armed themselves to avenge their hatred.

　　洪洞浮山群众自动武装报仇
    【本报阳城十九日电】侵占洪洞浮山蒋军，奸淫烧杀，野蛮残暴更甚于前。不仅一般没有武装起来的农民受了害，连国民党特务亦无法幸免。洪洞杨堡村国民党特务李奎生的娘，姑姑和他的媳妇通通被蒋军强奸了。纪落李老太太伤心的对我们区长哭诉着：“不能活了，中央军不是东西，坏的很哩！他们活活强奸了我媳妇，还拿枪托打了我……。”区长又碰见老太太的媳妇，她伤心的哭起来说：“我要找八路军替我报仇，中央军欺侮的我不能活了。”蒋军在浮山徐村住了三天，仅上月二十一这一天，就有五个妇女被强奸，群众损失更是严重，三天被蒋军抢走了九十八只羊，九十七只鸡，二百零五石粮食和许多衣物。由于蒋军的残无人道，群众已纷纷自动武装起来，报仇雪恨。
