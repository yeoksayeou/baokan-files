Experience in Countering "Reverse Settling of Accounts" in the Second District of Yuanqu

    Launch a comprehensive counter-reverse settling of accounts.

    (1) Enemy Situation: The enemy invaded the Second District of Yuanqu on August 26th. Following the invasion of the Chiang troops, rumors spread like wildfire. Reactionary landlords and special agents frantically spread rumors and intimidated the masses. The masses did not know how many Chiang troops had actually arrived, and the situation was chaotic for a time, causing the masses and some cadres to flee into the mountains. The next day, "Revenge Teams" and "Reverse Settling of Accounts Teams" arrived, baring their fangs and claws and frantically carrying out reverse settling of accounts against the peasants. Cao Laosan, a major scoundrel from Gaoluo, glared and demanded even more from the peasants: "In the past, you struggled against us; now it is we who will struggle against you." "Whoever struggled, whoever returns things." He also said: "As long as I blink my eyes, I can knock off your noses." What a mad, ferocious face! The peasants who had not left and were hiding in the village ran out when they saw the situation was not good.

    (2) First resolve two ideological issues: (1) Stay calm and don't panic. Although the peasants were somewhat panicked, they did not run around randomly, but rather sought out the cadres. What they urgently needed to resolve was what people were saying was so severe, what was really going on? They asked the cadres to come up with ideas and study solutions. Zhao Yuanxi, the district instructor, calmed down himself and calmly asked about the situation on the one hand, and explained to the masses, "Don't be afraid," on the other hand. After working for a day, he found out that there were only four regiments of enemies in total, not many. In the evening, the militia returned and reported two major victories: a militia squad dispersed an enemy advance battalion at Tiegu Mountain, and six militiamen confronted the enemy across a ditch at Guanjia Slope, fighting for a day and protecting the safe transfer of the masses in Gaoluo. Comrade Zhao Yuanxi immediately praised the militia's achievements and vigorously publicized them to the masses. Only then did everyone steel themselves and feel that the stubborn troops were not terrible. (2) "A strong dragon cannot suppress a local snake." Be bold and tough. Later, everyone began to study going down the mountain to fight those bastard grandchildren in the "Reverse Settling of Accounts Teams." At first, no one dared to go. Comrade Zhao Yuanxi asked, "Why don't you dare to go? What are you afraid of?" They said: "Afraid of special agents, afraid of bad people in the village, they know everything." So everyone started to discuss, "Are you really afraid?" Finally, everyone realized that there were not many bad guys, only one or two in a village. Some said, "A strong dragon cannot suppress a local snake," "He is familiar, and so are we," "Furthermore, we can catch him, and we can go anywhere. Besides, the bad guys are all pigs, not strong dragons." This immediately untied the knot in their minds, and everyone excitedly wanted to "be bold."

    (3) Resolutely suppress the "Big Reverse Settling of Accounts": On September 26th, a comprehensive counter-"Reverse Settling of Accounts" offensive was launched, and a competition was proposed to see who had the greatest achievements and did the best job. That night, the Gaoluo militia and cadres went to deal with Cao Laosan's village office, which was the general headquarters of the "Revenge Team" and "Reverse Settling of Accounts Team," only ten or twenty steps away from the碉堡 (I can't find a translation for this that applies to this context). Cao Laosan lived there. The militiamen quickly found out the details and immediately arrested him. As soon as he was dragged to the street, the enemy chased out of the 碉堡. The militiamen threw a few grenades at them, and the enemy shrank back into their tortoise shells. The militiamen immediately questioned Cao Laosan: "What did you say in the past? Who is being unreasonable?" The ghost cunningly argued: "I didn't say anything!" The militiamen were justified and forceful, and stabbed this "Big Reverse Settling of Accounts" Cao Laosan to death in a few strokes. The next day, militiamen from all directions returned and calculated that they had killed seven "Big Reverse Settlers of Accounts" that night, arrested several "Small Reverse Settlers of Accounts," and had not made a single mistake. This shot rang out, and the momentum increased.

    (4) Scared the "Small Reverse Settlers of Accounts": The next day, some of the targets of struggle declared, like mice seeing a cat, that they "had not reversed the settling of accounts," "dared not reverse the settling of accounts," and "were willing to return what they had reversed to the peasants, as long as they were not killed." Many landlords were afraid of being struggled against again. Seeing that the wind was not right, they dared not move. The peasants stipulated a method for dealing with these "Small Reverse Settlers of Accounts": First, return the grain that was reversed to the peasants, return it to whoever it belonged to; second, admit their mistakes to the peasants and ask them to make a guarantee that they would never act recklessly again; third, ask them to contact us, and we can arrest them at any time if they cause trouble again. This created an advantage for the emancipated peasants in the war environment.

    Peasants Wage Guerrilla Warfare

    (1) The militia developed greatly. After suppressing the arrogance of the bad guys through the counter-reverse settling of accounts and consolidating the peasants' achieved gains, the peasants' enthusiasm increased greatly. All the masses who participated in the counter-reverse settling of accounts automatically joined the militia, and each village established a guard militia, because the peasants realized that this was to protect the people's own emancipated interests, and that fighting was for themselves. On this basis, a widespread people's guerrilla war was launched.

    (2) Burning 碉堡 on a large scale. As soon as the enemy came, they built 碉堡 everywhere, forming a crisscross network of fire. But the enemy did not dare to disperse at night, building many but stationing few, with the rest being empty, as if they were using this as a talisman to scare people. But the peasants had very good intelligence. The cadres and militiamen studied the idea of burning 碉堡 on a large scale, burning down all the empty 碉堡. Especially on the night of September 9th, the militiamen carried wheat straw on their backs, the cover squads watched the enemy, and set fire to nine 碉堡, fires everywhere, scaring the enemy shitless, hiding in their tortoise shells and not daring to move. This was the "fire attack strategy" of the Yuanqu peasants against the enemy.

    (3) From then on, the militia's activities opened up. Countering maintenance, attacking transportation, killing the deputy captain of the "Revenge Team," they dared to do more and more as they were trained. They even dared to walk back and forth on the汽路 (can't find a translation for this that applies to this context) during the day, and sometimes even sang near the 碉堡. The world still belonged to the peasants! The peasants stood their ground in the village, and the work in the village was combined with the militia's activities.

    Three Basic Experiences

    (1) The people's guerrilla war was launched from the counter-reverse settling of accounts. The peasants themselves rose up to protect the fruits of emancipation, the peasants themselves took up guns to fight the enemy, and only then did we have the militia, only then did we have the guerrilla war, and only then did we have victory. This illustrates a fundamental truth: "For whom to fight, who will fight." Guerrilla warfare is to protect the people's emancipated interests, it is for the people's emancipation, this kind of guerrilla warfare is peasant guerrilla warfare. Without a clear mass viewpoint, a class viewpoint, if there is only a guerrilla隊 (corps? squad? ) and purely armed activities, without actively mobilizing the masses in the occupied areas, then nothing will be accomplished. Even if a guerrilla队 is formed, it is difficult to sustain, and it is difficult to create a fierce and powerful mass guerrilla war.

    (2) Be bold and unrestrained in the struggle against the enemy. The counter-reverse settling of accounts in the Second District of Yuanqu was entirely created by the masses, a mass activity. This kind of vigorous scene can never be accomplished by a few cadres and relying solely on the regular army. Only by letting the vast number of peasants do it can a widespread peasant guerrilla war be created. Here we have found three keys to being bold and unrestrained: (1) It is to make the peasants see from the struggle that their own strength is sufficient to subdue the enemy, and to dispel the idea of fearing the enemy. At the beginning, the peasants did not dare to be bold because they did not understand the situation. The paper tiger frightened them when it came fiercely, and they underestimated their own strength. But once they understand the situation, the enemy is not terrible. Do they dare to do it? In a word, "A strong dragon cannot suppress a local snake," "He is familiar, and so are we." This immediately made the peasants realize that the "local snake" is more powerful than the "strong dragon," and they immediately cheer up and are bold. (2) How to master the policy. Never hold on to the policy yourself, or only release a little bit and not dare to be bold. The peasants are asking you to let go and let the peasants do it, approve the peasants' demands and actions. Otherwise, we will be divorced from the masses. If the leading ideology does not have this spirit, looks left and right, and is constrained, it cannot accomplish great things. So, what is the responsibility of the cadres? The responsibility of the cadres is threefold: First, when the peasants' fear of the enemy cannot be overcome, solve the knot for the peasants. Use the examples experienced by the peasants themselves in the struggle to illustrate the comparison of enemy and our strength, point out the current favorable conditions for the peasants, and make them see their own strength and be bold. Second, approve and greatly develop the peasants' legitimate demands, behaviors, and new creations. Third, if the peasants have certain deviations in their actions, identify the direction and conduct ideological guidance, but not "command" compliance. In fact, after letting go, did the peasants do something wrong? Definitely not! The peasants suppressed only the big bad guys. Only those small bad guys bowed their heads to the peasants and handed over the peasants' things, and the peasants would forgive them. Because the peasants know clearly who is good and who is bad in the village, and to what extent they are bad. Therefore, as long as it is studied by the masses, the masses themselves will have a sense of propriety, so don't be afraid of the people's excessive behavior. (3) The cadres must be with the peasants. When the peasants are at their most difficult, they will seek out the cadres and inquire about the cadres' opinions, because they have personally experienced that the Communist Party's cadres are their cadres. As long as they stay calm and hold on, they can support the masses. Comrade Zhao Yuanxi, the district instructor, is like this. And only in this way can they lead the masses and train themselves in the war. If, when the peasants encounter difficulties, they are asking you to point out the direction and support them, but you escape into the mountains, the peasants will lose their leadership, their steps will be confused, and they will complain that you have left them. After the incident, because of the cadres' cowardice, the peasants will no longer trust you, and the cadres will have no face to see the peasants again. Furthermore, the mass work cadres have led the masses to emancipate themselves in peacetime, but they must also be with the peasants in wartime to protect the masses' emancipated interests. This is the revolutionary spirit that we should have and we should carry forward; phenomena of evading difficulties must be overcome.

    (3) We must first resolutely suppress the worst elements and break their ferocity. Suppressing the worst elements and confiscating their property is to protect the interests of the peasants. When the bad elements plead with the peasants for mercy, the peasants dare to be bold. Without such a necessary first step, the situation cannot be opened up. If we compromise, plead, and make peace with those reactionary guys, that is completely wrong. In fact, after suppressing the big bad guys, the small bad guys will come to surrender, and the peasants can accept the surrender. Otherwise, so-called "winning over" becomes impossible. Therefore, struggle is an offensive form for the people, not the peasants bowing their heads to the bad guys and begging for peace, but making the bad guys bow their heads to the peasants, not being afraid of him, but making him afraid of us. This is the people's spirit.

### 垣曲二区反“倒算”经验

　　垣曲二区反“倒算”经验
    发动全面反倒算
    （一）敌情：敌人是八月二十六号打进垣曲二区来的，随着蒋军的进犯，就是一阵谣言，反动地主特务大肆造谣恐吓，群众不知蒋军到底来了多少，情况一时混乱，致使群众和一部分干部向山里跑。第二天“复仇队”“倒算队”就来了，张牙舞爪的向农民疯狂倒算。皋落大坏蛋曹老三竖眉瞪眼的又向农民要开厉害：“过去是你们斗争我们，现在是我们斗争你们”。“过去谁斗，谁退东西。”并说：“只要我眼睛一闪，就可以打掉你们的鼻子。”好一个发狂的狰狞面孔！躲在村里未走的农民，看势不顺，就跑了出来。
    （二）首先解决两个思想：（１）稳住气不要惊慌。农民们虽然有些惊慌，可是不乱跑来跑去，还是找干部，他们迫切要解决的是人家说的厉害，到底怎么样啊？叫干部出主意，研究办法。区教导员赵元玺同志自己镇定的沉住气，一面赶忙问明情况，一面向群众解释，“不怕”。弄了一天，才查明敌人一共才四个团，并没有多少。傍晚，民兵又回来了，报告了两大胜利消息：一个民兵班在铁骨山冲散了敌人一个尖兵营，六个民兵在官家坡隔沟与敌相持，对打了一天，抢护了皋落群众安全转移。赵元玺同志当即表扬民兵战绩，大大向群众宣传，这时大家才硬住气了，觉得顽军并不可怕。（２）“强龙不压地头蛇”，放大胆干，硬住气，以后大家开始研究下山活动，打那些王八徒孙“倒算队”。起头谁也不敢去，赵元玺同志就问“为啥不敢去，到底怕什么？”说是：“怕特务，怕村里坏人，人家什么都知道”。于是大家就研究起来，“到底怕不怕？”最后大家弄明白，坏家伙并没有多少，一个村只有一两个，有的说：“强龙压不倒地头蛇”，“他熟咱也熟”，“进而可以捉他，咱们那里都可以转。再说，坏蛋们都是些笨猪，也不是强龙。”这一下子就解开思想上的疙瘩，于是大家兴奋的要“大胆的干”。
    （三）坚决镇压“大倒算”：九月二十六日发动了个全面反“倒算”攻势，并且提出竞赛，看谁成绩大，搞的好。皋落民兵和干部那天晚上去搞曹老三的村公所，是个“复仇队”“倒算队”的总机关，离碉堡一二十步远，曹老三就住在那里。民兵们很快弄清楚底细，马上就去抓住了他，人刚拉到大街上，敌人就从碉堡里追出来，民兵们用几颗手榴弹打过去，敌人又缩进王八窝里去了。民兵当下质问曹老三：“你过去说的啥，到底是谁不讲理？”这鬼却狡猾的强辩：“没有说呀！”民兵们有理有力，几下子就把这“大倒算”曹老三刺死了。第二天，各路民兵都回来，合计了一下，这一晚上打死了七个“大倒算”，扣来了几个“小倒算”，而且没有打错一个。这一炮打响了，劲头就高起来。
    （四）吓坏“小倒算”，“第二天，有些斗争对象就像老鼠见猫似的声明说他们“没有倒算”，“不敢倒算”，“愿把倒算的退还给农民，只要不杀就行”。很多地主是怕再斗争，看风势不对，就不敢动了。农民对这些“小倒算”规定了个处理办法：第一、把倒算的粮食退给农民，是谁的还给谁；第二、向农民认错，叫他做保证，以后决不再胡作乱为；第三、叫他和我们联络，他要再捣鬼，随时就可以捉拿他。这样便造成了战争环境中翻身农民的优势。
    农民打游击
    （一）民兵大大发展。经过反倒算把坏蛋们的气焰压下去了，巩固了农民既得果实，农民劲头就大了，凡是参加反倒算的群众都自动参加了民兵，各村都成立起警卫民兵，因为农民认清了这是保卫人民自己翻身利益，打仗是为自己打。就在这个基础上，展开了广泛的人民游击战争。
    （二）大烧碉堡。敌人一来就到处修碉堡，碉堡对碉堡，形成交叉火网。可是敌人晚上不敢分散，修的多，驻的少，其余都是空的，好像是拿这做护身符吓唬人，可是农民们情报很灵，干部和民兵们研究来个大烧碉堡，凡是空碉堡都给他烧掉。尤其是九月九日的晚上，民兵们背上麦秸，掩护班看住敌人，一点火就烧毁九座碉堡，遍地起火，把敌人吓的屁滚尿流，钻在王八窝里不敢动。这是垣曲农民对敌斗争的“火攻计”。
    （三）从此，民兵活动开了。反维持、打运输，打死了“复仇队”队副，他们越锻炼越敢干，白天也敢在汽路上走来走去，有时还在碉堡附近唱歌，天下还是农民的！农民在村里站得住，村里的工作和民兵活动结合起来。
    三个基本经验
    （一）从反倒算搞开了人民游击队战争。农民自己起来保卫翻身果实，农民自己拿起枪杆子打敌人，这样才有了民兵，才有了游击战争，才有了胜利。这说明一个根本道理：“为谁打，谁来打”。游击战争就是保卫人民翻身利益，就是为了人民翻身，这种游击战争就是农民游击战争。如果没有明确的群众观点，阶级观点，如果只有游击队，单纯武装活动，而不积极发动沦陷区群众，那就将一事无成。即使搞起游击队来，也很难持久，很难造成猛烈而有力的群众性的游击战争。
    （二）对敌斗争要放手大胆。垣曲二区的反倒算完全是群众创造，群众活动，这种轰轰烈烈的场面，决不是几个干部和单纯依靠正规军所能干成的。只有放手让广大农民去干，才能造成广泛的农民游击战争。这里找到了大胆放手的三个关键：（一）是使农民从斗争中看到自己的力量足以制服敌人，解除了害怕敌人的思想。开始农民不敢大胆干，是弄不清情况，纸老虎猛一来给吓住了，把自己力量估计的过小。可是，一弄清情况，敌人并不可怕，敢不敢干呢？一句话“强龙压不倒地头蛇”，“他熟咱也熟”，这一下子就使农民认识“地头蛇”比“强龙”还厉害，那就立即振奋起精神，放大胆干了。（二）是如何掌握政策。对政策绝不是自己拿住不放，或只放一点不敢大胆。农民是要求你大放开手，叫农民干，批准农民的要求和行动。否则我们就会脱离群众。领导思想如果没有这种精神，左顾右盼，束手束脚，就不能办大事。那么，干部的责任是什么呢？干部的责任有三：第一、当农民害怕敌人的思想打不通时，就给农民解疙瘩。用农民自己在斗争中经历的事例，说明敌我力量的对比，指出农民当前的有利条件，使其看清自己的力量，而胆壮起来。第二、对农民的正当要求行为和新的创造要批准而大大发展。第三、如农民在行动中产生某些偏向，要认明方向，做思想诱导，但不是“命令”照办。实际上放手以后，农民干错了没有呢？肯定的说，没有干错！农民所镇压的都是大坏蛋，只有那些小坏蛋向农民低头，交出农民的东西，农民还会饶恕他们。因为村子里谁好谁坏，谁坏到什么程度，农民知道的清清楚楚。所以只要经过群众研究，群众自己就有分寸，所以不要怕人民有过火行为。（三）是干部必须和农民在一起，农民一到最艰苦的时候，就要找干部，探听干部的意见，因为他们已亲身体验到共产党的干部是为他们的干部，只要沉住气、拿得硬，就能给群众撑腰，区教导员赵元玺同志就是这做样的。而且只有这样才能在战争中带领群众，锻炼自己。如果当农民遇到困难的时候，正要求你指明方向，撑腰作主，而你却逃向大山里去，农民就会失掉领导，错乱脚步，就会埋怨你离开他。事过以后，因为干部的怯懦，农民会不再信赖你，干部也无脸再见农民。再说群众工作干部在平时领导了群众翻身是好的，但在战时也必须和农民在一起保卫群众翻身利益的，这才是应有的革命精神，我们应该发挥；对于逃避困难的现象则必须加以克服。
    （三）必须首先对最坏分子以坚决镇压，打垮他的凶焰。镇压最坏分子及没收其财产，就是保护农民利益，坏分子向农民哀告求饶，农民方敢大胆起来干，如果没有这样首先必要的步骤，那就打不开局面。如果对那些反动家伙妥协哀告讲和，那是完全错误的。事实上，镇压了大坏蛋，小坏蛋就要来投降，农民就可以受降。否则，所谓“争取”就成为不可能。所以，斗争在人民说来是一种进攻的形态，不是农民向坏蛋低头求和，而是使坏蛋们向农民低头，不是怕他而是叫他怕咱，这才是人民的气魄。
