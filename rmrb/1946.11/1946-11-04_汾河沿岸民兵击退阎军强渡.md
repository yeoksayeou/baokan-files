Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 1st. Militia along the Fen River, in Sixian Village, twenty li northwest of Qi County, repelled an attack by more than twenty times their number of Yan Army troops. At dawn on the 21st, more than 800 Yan Army soldiers, equipped with light artillery and heavy machine guns, attempted to cross the Fen River under heavy artillery fire cover. The more than 20 militiamen guarding the river put up a calm resistance, and nearby militiamen and river defense guard teams also rushed to help, launching a counterattack under the unified command of the Eighth District Captain. Militia bazooka shooter Wang Sican fired three shots in a row, and the enemy's machine gun immediately stopped roaring. Under the sound of the bugle, two machine guns swept towards the enemy. The militiamen jumped up and chased after the fleeing Yan Army. In this battle, more than ten Yan soldiers were killed or wounded, and none of the militiamen were injured or killed. Thirty-two bags of grain were seized and all returned to the masses.
