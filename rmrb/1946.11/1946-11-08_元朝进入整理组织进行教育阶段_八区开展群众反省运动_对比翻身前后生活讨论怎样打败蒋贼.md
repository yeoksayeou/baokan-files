(Our newspaper, Weixian, 3rd dispatch) Yuan Dynasty, in the movement to fill in the gaps and make up the numbers, the entire county's farmers victoriously eliminated feudal exploitation and are now consolidating their organizations and conducting education. In order to raise the political consciousness of the masses, the villages in the Eighth District are launching a mass reflection movement. The methods are: 1. First, village cadres and activists hold criticism meetings to examine everyone's position and attitude in the movement; 2. Then, all cadre representatives and committee members collectively reflect on the political and economic comparisons before and after emancipation, and then discuss; 3. Convene a farmers' meeting, where leading cadres first make mobilization speeches, followed by farmer, women, children, and sister organizations, in groups, led by representatives to reflect, compare life before and after emancipation, and discuss how to defeat Chiang Kai-shek's offensive; 4. Representatives from each group summarize the reflection, then hold a farmers' meeting to instill the reflection summary into the masses; 5. Finally, convene a farmers' meeting to celebrate the victory of emancipation, hold parades and demonstrations, vow to defeat Chiang Kai-shek; and conduct reflection, so that everyone can come to the stage to describe the oppression and suffering they suffered in the past, and the specific benefits they have received under the leadership of the Communist Party. Then, led by activists, collectively take an oath to follow the Communist Party forever, that poor and lower-middle peasants are one family, to defeat the joint American-Chiang offensive, and to fight to defend our homes and fields!
