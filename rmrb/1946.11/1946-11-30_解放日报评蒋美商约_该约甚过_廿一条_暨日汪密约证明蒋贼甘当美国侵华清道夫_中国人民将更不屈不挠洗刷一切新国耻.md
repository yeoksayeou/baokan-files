　　Liberation Daily Comments on the Sino-American Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation
    This Treaty Surpasses the "Twenty-One Demands" and the Japan-Wang Secret Agreement, Proving Chiang Kai-shek is Willing to Act as a Scavenger for American Aggression Against China
    The Chinese People Will More Unyieldingly Wash Away All New National Humiliations
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 27th] The Liberation Daily editorial of the day, "Commentary on the Sino-American Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation," stated: "Under the absolutely false guise of 'equality' between the two sides, this treaty is in fact absolutely unequal. China is completely open to the United States, and American imperialism can do whatever it wants on Chinese territory as if it were its own. American enterprises enjoy various special treatments in China, and China has completely lost its tariff autonomy and its rights of navigation along the coast and inland rivers. By signing this traitorous treaty, Chiang Kai-shek has offered all of China's economic lifelines to American financial magnates with both hands... No wonder a British Member of Parliament said that this treaty is 'the most barbaric economic aggression ever seen' against China." The editorial compared this Sino-American Treaty with the "Twenty-One Demands" of thirty years ago and the Japan-Wang Secret Agreement of eight years ago, pointing out that the former only focused on special rights in Shandong and Manchuria, and the latter also focused on economic privileges in North China, Inner Mongolia, and Shanghai. However, the Sino-American Treaty far exceeds these, encompassing "the entire territory of China" in scope, which Yuan Shikai and Wang Jingwei did not dare to do. Chiang Kai-shek, in order to obtain the capital for the civil war, has now brazenly done it. The unlimited economic control that American imperialism has obtained from Chiang Kai-shek is matched by its unlimited political and military control over the Chiang regime, which Yuan Shikai did not dare to admit in the Twenty-One Demands, and which Wang Jingwei admitted even less in the Japan-Wang Secret Agreement. The editorial stated: American imperialism attempts to sign such "commercial treaties" with other countries to economically invade and dominate the entire world. But even Britain does not dare to sign such a treaty with the United States. The signing of the Sino-American Treaty is sufficient to show that Chiang Kai-shek is willing to be a scavenger for American imperialism's expansionist policies. The negotiation process of the Sino-American Treaty was completely secret, and it is only a small part of the Chiang-American secret agreements that has been revealed. Gu Weijun, the representative of the Chiang government, said on the 21st at the Political and Security Committee of the United Nations: the stationing of American troops in China is based on an agreement between the two governments, and the so-called agreement is a secret agreement. According to this secret agreement, American imperialism can station troops in China, occupy military ports and everything else, and turn China into an American military base, and Chiang Kai-shek uses this to exchange for the US government's assistance to him. The editorial concluded: "The Chinese people can further recognize from this treaty the ambition of American imperialism to destroy China and the determination of the Chiang Kai-shek government to sell out China. They can further recognize the sacred significance of the self-defense war waged by the military and civilians of the liberated areas today to defend peace, independence, and democracy, and to oppose betrayal and dictatorship. We, the Chinese people, must oppose this Sino-American Treaty as resolutely as we opposed all traitorous treaties in history, and we must also oppose all secret agreements between Chiang Kai-shek and the United States. We must fight with more firmness and perseverance to wash away all the new national humiliations created by Chiang Kai-shek!"

　　解放日报评蒋美商约
    该约甚过“廿一条”暨日汪密约证明蒋贼甘当美国侵华清道夫
    中国人民将更不屈不挠洗刷一切新国耻
    【新华社延安二十七日电】是日解放日报社论“评蒋美商约”称：“在这一个以双方‘平等”为绝对虚伪的烟幕、实际上绝对不平等的条约之下，中国对美一切开放，美国帝国主义在中国领土上如在其本国领土上一样，可以为所欲为。美国企业在中国享受了各种特殊待遇，中国完全断丧了关税自主权，断丧了沿海及内河的航行权。蒋介石签订了这个卖身契约，就把中国的一切经济命脉双手奉献给美国的金融财阀了……无怪乎英国议员说，这个条约是对中国“从未见过的最野蛮的经济侵略”。该社论拿三十年前的“二十一条”与八年前的日汪密约与这个蒋美商约相比，指出前者仅着重在山东及满蒙的特权，后者也是着重在华北、内蒙以及上海的经济特权，而蒋美商约远超过这些，在范围上包括了“中国领土全境”，为袁世凯、汪精卫所不敢作的，蒋介石为了取得内战的赌本，现在都悍然地作了。美帝国主义从蒋介石手里所取得的这种经济上的无限控制权，乃是其政治及军事上对蒋政权有无限控制权的，同样为袁世凯在二十一条中所不敢承认，并比汪精卫在日汪密约中所承认的还多。该社论称：美帝国主义企图与其他国家签订这类“商约”，在经济上侵略与统治全世界。但就是英国，也不敢与美国订立这样的条约，蒋美商约之签订，足以说明蒋介石甘为美帝国主义扩张政策的清道夫。蒋美商约的谈判过程，是完全秘密的，它仅仅是蒋美密约透露出来的一小部分。蒋政府代表顾维钧二十一日在联合国政治安全委员会上说：美国在华驻军是根据两国政府的协议，所谓协议就是密约。根据这个密约，美帝国主义可以在中国驻兵，侵占军港及其他一切，把中国变成美方军事基地，而蒋介石即以此换取美政府对他的援助。社论结语称：“中国人民可以从这个条约中更认识到美帝国主义灭亡中国的野心，和蒋介石政府出卖中国的决心，可以更认识到今天解放区军民保卫和平独立与民主，反对卖国与独裁的自卫战争的神圣意义。我们中国人民要和反对所有历史上的卖国条约一样，不仅坚决反对这个蒋美商约，而且反对蒋美间一切密约，我们要更坚定不屈不挠的斗争，洗刷蒋介石所制造的一切新国耻！”
