　　[Changzhi News from Our Newspaper] The Second District of this county recently convened a conference of 400 village cadres and activists to conduct a major inspection of war preparations. The inspection revealed that, after war preparation mobilization and current affairs education in various villages, the majority of the masses have overcome the previous complacency and paralysis, thinking that "the Taihang Mountains are too high for them to come," as well as the fear that the Chiang troops would come and ravage and devastate. The emancipated masses in various villages are now making tense and serious war preparations. The command posts in various villages are reviewing the militia, organizing combat squads, demolition teams, intelligence networks, repairing and equipping weapons. The entire district has purchased more than 800 landmines and 5,400 hand grenades, and is continuing to pay factories to order more. Nan Dong, the director of the Armed Forces Committee, said: "These landmines will be exchanged for his American weapons!" Li Haigen, who just became emancipated, is 54 years old and doesn't know how to throw hand grenades, but he picked up a red-tasseled spear and said: "I will fight his dogs with this spear!" The masses are working day and night to clear the fields and hide grain. The village chief of Jiaojiazhuang is actively arranging for his family to prepare to lead the militia to fight a guerrilla war. The masses' slogan is: "Don't let the enemy seize a grain of food, don't let the enemy capture a single person." Various villages have also organized more than 200 retired soldiers to participate in the guerrilla organization. In war preparations, all villages have combined counter-espionage and anti-special agent work. At the meeting, village cadres and activists unanimously and resolutely swore to share life and death with the people, struggle together, and eliminate the reactionaries.
