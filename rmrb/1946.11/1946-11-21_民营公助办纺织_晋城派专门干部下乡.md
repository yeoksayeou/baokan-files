　　Jincheng Sends Special Cadres to the Countryside
　　[This Dispatch from Yangcheng, 17th] The Jincheng economic sector has decided to vigorously develop winter textile production in areas of the county where thorough land reform has been implemented, to help the masses become wealthy. The Jincheng Branch Cooperative of the Jinnan Bank, the Jincheng County United Cooperative, and the county government have dispatched 35 special cadres to the countryside to organize this work. On October 27th, the Jincheng County Government, in conjunction with the aforementioned economic production departments, discussed the issue of developing women's textile production, deciding that this winter, in areas where land reform has been thoroughly implemented, 240,000 jin of cotton should be spun and 120,000 bolts of cloth woven. The county currently has 10,000 women spinners and 800 weavers, and plans to further develop the workforce by adding 5,000 women spinners and 1,200 weavers. It is estimated that the task can be successfully completed in four months of spinning and weaving. The raw materials needed will mainly rely on the masses exporting products such as daylily, hawthorn, medicinal materials, pears, persimmons, Sichuan peppercorns, and ironware in exchange for cotton. The Jinnan Bank will also issue textile loans of 3 million yuan. The County United Cooperative will sell 50,000 jin of cotton to the masses at a price 5% lower than the market price, and the county government will then lend another 5,000 jin of cotton. It has been decided to select 15 villages in the 3rd, 6th, 7th, and 9th districts as textile bases. Each village will set up a textile training class, hiring technicians to teach weaving. Each village cooperative will personally organize and lead a textile factory or group to create experience.

    晋城派专门干部下乡
    【本报阳城十七日电】晋城经济界决定在该县彻底实现土地改革地区，大力开展冬季纺织，帮助群众发财致富。冀南银行晋城支行合作社，晋城县联合社，及县政府已派遣三十五个专门干部下乡，组织这项工作。上月二十七日，晋城县政府曾协同上述经济生产部门，讨论开展妇女纺织问题，决定今冬在土地改革彻底实现地区，纺花二十四万斤，织布十二万匹。该县现有纺妇一万人，织妇八百人，拟再发展纺妇五千人织妇一千二百人，预计纺织四个月，任务即可胜利完成。所需原料主要依靠群众输出黄花、山查、药料、梨、柿、花椒、铁货等产品、换回棉花。并由冀南银行发放纺织贷款三百万元。县联社以低于市价百分之五的价格售给群众棉花五万斤，县政府再贷花五千斤。确定在三、六、七、九四个区选择十五个村为纺织基点，每村设一纺织训练班，聘请技师，教练织布，每个村合作社得亲自组织领导一个纺织厂或小组以便创造经验。
