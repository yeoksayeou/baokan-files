　　Japan's Two Major Electrical and Mining Unions
    Establish Anti-Yoshida United Front

    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 30th] Tokyo dispatch: The All-Japan Electrical Workers' Union and the All-Japan Coal Miners' Union announced on the 27th that the two major unions have established a united front against the Zaibatsu and the Yoshida Cabinet. The two major unions, initiators of the "October Offensive," with 200,000 members, denounced the Yoshida government in their joint statement, pointing out that Yoshida colludes with the Zaibatsu in an attempt to crush the basic rights of workers. They also stated that the unity of the two major unions will promote a larger-scale development of the October Offensive, and they firmly believe that the unity of the Japanese working class itself will promote a nationwide democratic front encompassing all classes, and ultimately defeat the reactionary forces.
