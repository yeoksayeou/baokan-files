[Taiyue, 12th Dispatch] Cao Pu, Director of the Taiyue Military Commission General Headquarters, published an article in the Taiyue Xinhua Daily on the 12th calling for the continued development of the explosion offensive, so that every household plants mines and every village explodes. The original text is as follows:

    In order to counter the large-scale offensive of the Chiang army, the people of our region responded to the call of the Military Commission General Headquarters for an explosion offensive. An explosion movement has been vigorously launched in various places. The "Iron and Stone United Defense" in Hongdong and Fushan, and the combination of landmines and sniper fire in Huo County, have put the invading Chiang army in a state of extreme nervousness, where every bush and rock is a mine. Dong Huasheng and Guo Buliang, cadres from Huo County, personally led district cadres Wu Jin and Li Ying in laying mines. As a result, at Hongyazi Cave, the Chiang army was blown to pieces, with corpses scattered everywhere, blood and flesh flying. American-style military hats were seen dancing in the air, and American-made guns and cannons were blown to pieces by the iron and stone weapons of the people. The cost of thirteen mines exchanged for the lives of sixteen invading Chiang soldiers. In another instance, Hongdong militiamen eliminated a Chiang army heavy machine gun squad of twelve men with two iron mines. Du Balian militiamen wounded seven Chiang soldiers with a "immovable" mine. Shimin militiamen carried out a large-scale lure-and-explode operation in Jiyuan on October 10th. Jiyuan militiamen entered the city to carry out explosions on October 30th, and so on. In just one month since the start of the explosion offensive, the casualties of the Chiang army have exceeded one hundred, while our militiamen have suffered no casualties in explosion operations. No wonder the Chiang army's fear of explosions has reached the point where they turn pale at the mere mention of it. Yang Zhongshu, a captured Chiang soldier from Huo County, said: The Chiang soldiers in Huo County are bitterly talking about these two sentences: "It's easier to fight in the open, but it's hardest to defend against secret explosions." Of course, this explosion movement of the people to strike at the Chiang army is only just beginning. At present, men, women, old and young in various places are nervously preparing for explosions. Magnetic mines, wooden mines, brick mines, mud mines, iron mines, and stone mines are all being prepared for use. Some militiamen have already set up their planned minefields, and some elementary school students have completed their wooden signs and mine pits in advance. Some villages have dug horse-trapping pits, and some roads have begun to be covered with debris (spreading random grass and firewood everywhere to make it difficult for the enemy to distinguish between dangerous and safe areas) and cut off. Some women have tied up straw men in preparation for explosions, and some young people have even moved the mud gods from the temples to let them "curse the enemy." In short, the people of the entire region are concentrating on preparing for explosions, with the minds of millions of people focused on one goal: "To set up a dragnet and give the invaders a devastating blow!" If the Chiang army dares to invade, then they will only be "invited into the urn."

    Since the explosion offensive began, we have gained the experience that the vast number of people, having mastered explosion technology, will inflict unexpected casualties on the invaders. Therefore, from now on, we must: (1) Vigorously carry out the explosion offensive. Militiamen in various places, whether engaging in activities behind enemy lines, frontal resistance, flank defense, or internal preparations, should focus on explosions. Those areas where this is not being done sufficiently should immediately catch up. (2) Create a mass explosion movement, calling on every household to plant mines and every village to explode. However, there should also be focused mine laying, with organizations responsible for arranging minefields and explosion teams dedicated to managing minefields, as well as mobile sniper explosion teams to grasp the enemy's situation and carry out mobile explosions. This will suit the flexibility of war and also suit the mass nature of dispersion and universality. (3) Carry out further ideological mobilization for explosions, overcome certain ideas that underestimate explosions, and at the same time exchange explosion techniques. Prepare sufficient explosives, and also follow the example of the leaders of Huo County in personally arranging and doing it themselves. As long as we do the above three things, our explosion offensive will set off a vigorous mass movement, striking the Chiang Kai-shek invading army everywhere.

    太岳武委总会主任号召
    家家埋雷村村爆炸
    继续开展爆炸运动，陷蒋军于草木皆兵乱石皆雷中。
    【本报太岳十二日电】太岳武委总会主任曹普于十二日在太岳新华日报上著文号召继续开展爆炸攻势，做到家家埋雷，村村爆炸。原文如下：我区人民为反击蒋军的大举进攻，响应了武总爆炸攻势的号召，各地已蓬蓬勃勃地展开了爆炸运动，洪洞、浮山的“铁石联防”，霍县的地雷冷枪结合，已使进犯蒋军陷于草木皆兵乱石皆雷的惊恐状态中。霍县干部董华生、郭不亮亲自领导区干部武进、李英拉雷布阵，结果在红崖洞上炸得蒋军死尸满地，血肉横飞，美式的军帽也炸在空中跳舞，美制的枪炮也被人民的铁石武器炸得残缺不全，十三颗雷的代价竟换了十六个进犯蒋军的性命。其他洪洞民兵曾以两颗铁雷消灭了蒋军十二个人的重机枪班。杜八联民兵用一个“起不走”雷打伤了蒋军七名。士敏民兵十月十日在济源进行了诱敌大爆炸。济源民兵在十月三十日进入城内爆炸等等。仅在爆炸攻势开始的一月，蒋军的死伤已超过百人以上，而我民兵在爆炸作战中无一伤亡，无怪乎蒋军对于爆炸的恐惧已是谈虎色变。霍县被解放的蒋军杨忠书说：霍县蒋军都苦闷的谈着这样两句话：“明打还好办，暗炸最难防”。当然，这个人民打击蒋军的爆炸运动，仅仅还在开始，现各地的男女老少都在紧张的准备着爆炸，磁雷、木雷、砖雷、泥雷、铁雷、石雷都应有尽有的准备着使用，有的民兵们把他们所预定的雷阵已经摆好，有的小学生们把他们应写的木牌和应挖的雷坑都提前完成，有的村挖好了陷马坑，有的路上已开始了铺地（到处铺乱草乱柴，使敌人难辨危险区与安全区）和断路，有的妇女们绑了草人，准备爆炸，还有的年青人把庙里的泥神也搬出来，让他“骂阵”，总之全区人民都在聚精会神的忙着准备爆炸，千万人的心情，只为着一个目的：“布置天罗地网，给进犯者以毁灭打击！”如蒋军敢于进犯，那就只有“请君入瓮”。爆炸攻势进行以来，我们得到了这样一个经验，即广大人民掌握了爆炸技术，会给予进犯者以出乎意外的杀伤，因此今后必须：（一）用大力开展爆炸攻势，各地民兵无论在顽后活动，正面阻击，侧面联防，内地备战，都应以爆炸为主，个别地区做得不够者，应急起直追。（二）要造成群众性的爆炸运动，号召家家埋雷，村村爆炸。但还应有重点的埋雷，要有负责布置雷区和专管雷区的爆炸队的组织，还要有冷枪爆炸小组的机动组织，掌握敌情机动爆炸。这样就适合战争的机动灵活，又适合群众性的分散普遍。（三）要有进一步的爆炸思想动员，克服某些轻视爆炸的思想，同时作爆炸技术的交流，要准备充分的爆炸物，还必须如霍县领导者的亲自布置和亲自动手。只要我们作到以上三件事，我们的爆炸攻势就会掀起一个轰轰烈烈的群众运动，到处打击蒋介石进犯军。
