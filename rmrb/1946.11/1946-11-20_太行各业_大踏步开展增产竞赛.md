    Leap Forward in Production Increase Competition
    Model Workers Emerge in Large Numbers
    XX Ordnance Factory Focuses on Quality and Quantity

    Changzhi Paper Mill Completes Three-Month Production Plan in Forty-Nine Days
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] Under the general call to redouble efforts and strengthen the material strength of the comprehensive resistance, the production increase competition movement in Taihang industries has unfolded in great strides, and model workers have emerged in large numbers. The output of the XX Ordnance Factory has increased dramatically since August, but the quality was not high enough. For this reason, a special meeting was held for review. When everyone understood that the killing effectiveness of weapons was important, they unanimously agreed that not only should the quantity be large, but the quality should also be high. In October, in addition to the continued increase in quantity, the quality was also improved by using a large knife to roughly shape parts, followed by a small knife for finishing, and the gun holes were drilled very accurately. Worker Li Baoyuan also guaranteed to teach his apprentice how to drill gun holes this month. The sight department led by labor heroes Gui Xiufeng also ensured that the sights passed the templates without rework and proposed a competition with the gun body department and the bolt department. The coal mining industries in Xiangyuan, Xiyang, Lucheng, Zuoquan and other places increased production in October more than ever before: Zuoquan Shigang Coal Mine, which used to only produce sixty carts of coal a day, increased its output to 5,000 jin per day after the implementation of labor-capital cooperation in July this year. In October, due to the production increase competition, the output suddenly increased to 15,000 jin per day. Workers from the Xiangyuan Wuyang Coal Mine, together with nearby farmers, raised 3.5 million yuan to jointly build a Wuyang Machine Coal Mine with the Lucheng United Cooperative and the bank. More than 100 workers personally transported and installed the machines, and mining began at the end of October, with a daily output of ×× tons of coal. The workers said, "Let's produce more coal for the ordnance factory, so they can make more guns and cannons to fight the reactionaries!" Workers from the Taoshu and Shilou coal mines also voluntarily pooled funds to build three new kilns; the General Kiln was completed at the end of October, with a daily output of 28,000 jin of coal. Other coal mines, such as the Xiaohebao (Changzhi) Coal Mine, produced 122,400 jin of coal per day, the Xiyang Chengguan Coal Mine produced more than 40,000 jin of coal per day, and the Xiangyuan Lao＠jiao produced 31 hanging baskets of coal per day, all exceeding the September output by one-quarter to one-half. A large number of labor heroes and model cadres emerged in various coal mines: for example, the Xiaohebao Coal Mine alone produced as many as 240 model workers. Liu Jingwen, the chairman of the Lucheng horseshoe union, at the age of fifty, still goes up and down the mine to personally install water-pumping boilers, which moved all the workers in the factory to work harder. Twenty-eight paper mills in eight counties and cities including Xiyang and Lucheng also created brilliant achievements in the October production increase. In the last month and a half, the Xiangyuan Fifth District Paper Mill has increased the production of paper by 120 qu with five paper pools, and saved the raw materials for 71 qu of paper, making a profit of more than 350,000 yuan. In order to further increase production, the eleven paper mills in the county decided: 1. Save raw materials, and pay workers 50% of the saved tool depreciation; 2. Those who exceed the quality and quantity standards will receive double wages. In the October production summary, the Fifth District Paper Mill believed that manager Liu Jinshuo's democratic leadership style and the reward and profit-sharing system were important factors for increasing production. Under the leadership of model cadre Comrade Wu Changhan, the Changzhi Paper Mill has completed the production plans for September, October, and November in 49 days since September 2nd, with more than 6,000 jin of pulp and more than 1,100 qu of paper. In addition, the textile industry in Yushe, Changzhi, and other places also increased production in October. For example, the workers of Changzhi Huashengtong Sock Factory increased the number of socks knitted per day from four dozen to six dozen. The workers of Yushe Fengmin Textile Factory increased the weaving of iron machine cloth from 4.5 zhang to 5.5 zhang. The ceramics industry has also achieved great results. For example, the Wuxiang Qingbeishan Ceramic Kiln has increased production by one large urn per day since October, and has greatly improved the quality. In the past, the urn that could hold one shi and two dou of grain weighed 180 jin, but now it has been reduced to 120 jin. In the past, it took eight and a half days to burn a kiln, but now it only takes five days, saving 100 baskets of coal per kiln.

    大踏步开展增产竞赛
    模范职工大批涌现
    ××军火厂重质又重量
    五阳石楼煤矿工人自动集股打新窑
    长治纸厂三月生产计划四十九天完成
    【本报特讯】在再接再厉，加强全面抵抗的物质力量总号召下，太行各业增产竞赛运动大踏步展开，模范职工，大批涌现。××军火工厂自八月份后产量即有惊人增加，惟质量尚不够高，为此特开会检讨，当大家明了武器要看重杀伤效力后，一致认为：不但量要多，而且质要高。十月份内除数量继续增加外，质量上均做到了作零件过大＠刀后，还用小＠刀溜一遍，枪眼都钻得很正。工人李保元并保证本月内教会徒弟打枪眼。劳英桂秀峰领导的标尺部也做到标尺过样板，交贷没打来回，且向成枪部、枪拴部提出竞赛。襄垣、昔阳、潞城、左权等地煤矿业十月份增产量超过以往任何时候：左权石港煤矿从来每天只出六十挂车煤的“定规”，今年七月份实行劳资合作后，产量增加到每日五千斤。十月份因增产竞赛，产量突然增至日产万五千斤。襄垣五阳煤矿工人联合附近农民集资三百五十万元，和潞城联合社、银行等共建五阳机器煤矿一座。百余工人亲自运机器安机器，已于十月底开始采掘，日产煤××吨，工人们说：“多产些煤给军火工厂吧，好多造枪炮打反动派呵！”桃树、石楼煤矿工人亦自动集股打新窑三座；将军＠窑十月底竣工，日产煤二万八千斤。其他小河堡（长治）煤矿日产煤十二万二千四百斤，昔阳城关煤窑日产煤四万余斤，襄垣老＠郊日产煤三十一挂筐等均超过九月份产量的四分之一至二分之一。各煤矿均涌现大批劳动英雄及模范干部：如小河堡煤矿即涌现模范职工二百四十名之多。潞城马掌工会主任刘景文，五秩高龄，尚上下矿坑，亲自安置打水锅炉，感动全厂职工更努力生产。昔阳、潞城等八个县市的二十八家纸厂亦于十月增产中创造了光辉成绩。襄垣五区纸厂最近一个半月内，五个纸池共增产纸一百二十区，并省下七十一区纸的原料。获利三十五万余元，全县十一个纸厂为使增产获得进一步成绩，特决定：一、节省原料、工具折钱按百分之五十分给工人；二、超过质、量标准者领双工资。五区纸厂于十月份生产总结中，认为经理刘金锁领导上的民主作风与奖励、分红制是增产的重要因素。长治纸厂在模范干部武昌汉同志领导下，自九月二号起四十九天内已完成九、十、十一三个月生产计划，计打料六千余斤，抄纸一千一百余区。另，榆社、长治、等地纺织业亦于十月份提高了生产量。如长治华盛通织袜工人每天织袜由四打增至六打。榆社丰民纺织厂工人织铁机布由四丈五增至五丈五等。磁窑业方面亦获很大成绩。如武乡青背山磁窑十月开始，每天增产大瓮一个，特别在质量上提高了一大步。过去能装一石二斗粮的瓮，重一百八十斤，现在减为一百二十斤。过去需八天半烧一窑，现在五天就成，一窑节省煤一百筐。
