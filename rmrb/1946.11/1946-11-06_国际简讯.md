　　United Press, San Francisco, October 14th: General Carlson, chairman of the American Committee for Peace, who presided over the "China and the Far East Conference" in San Francisco, stated that the Chinese government's order on October 10th to resume the conscription law is tantamount to Chiang Kai-shek's determination to engage in a full-scale civil war, and he is confident that the United States will fully support him. This move is indeed disturbing. I believe the best way to solve the problem is to immediately withdraw American troops stationed in China and cancel all aid to Chiang Kai-shek until he stops fighting the Chinese people and organizes a coalition government.
　　TASS News Agency: The work of the Soviet-American Korean Joint Commission has stalled in the past few months because the American delegation has no sincerity in complying with the Moscow Foreign Ministers' decision. Hodge, commander-in-chief of the US military in South Korea, wants the Soviet Union to abandon its claim that the work of the Soviet-American Joint Commission should only consult the opinions of Korean democratic parties. Moreover, Hodge's interpretation of the word "democratic" is obviously beneficial to the reactionary forces in Korea. He believes that it is "undemocratic" not to consult with the reactionary parties. Chistiakov, commander-in-chief of the Soviet army in North Korea, has repeatedly stated in his letters to Hodge that the Soviet Union is willing to restore the Joint Commission based on the decisions made regarding Korea at the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference. However, Hodge rejected the Soviet proposal, insisting on his attempt to revise the decisions of the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference.
　　Paris Dispatch: Representatives from the Central Committee of the Yugoslav Trade Unions, the Italian General Confederation of Labor, the Trieste Labor Union, and various city joint trade unions recently held a meeting here. The chairman was Saillant, Secretary-General of the World Federation of Trade Unions. The trade union representatives have agreed in principle to establish a joint trade union organization in Trieste and decided to convene a city trade union congress before March 1st next year in order to establish the City General Confederation of Labor.

    美联社旧金山十月十四日电：在旧金山主持“中国与远东大会”之美争取和平委员会主席卡尔逊将军谈称：中国政府十月十日下令恢复征兵法，此无异蒋介石已决心从事全面内战，并以美国将彻底支持自信，此举实令人不安。余以为解决问题莫如立即撤退驻华美军及取消对蒋氏一切援助，以待其停止对中国人民作战及组织联合政府。
    塔斯社讯：在过去数月内、苏美朝鲜共同委员会的工作停顿下来，系因美国代表团对于遵守莫斯科外长决定毫无诚意。鲜南美军总司令霍奇，要苏联放弃主张苏美共同委员会的工作，只应咨询朝鲜民主党派的意见，而且霍奇对“民主”一词的解释显然是有利于朝鲜的反动势力，他认为不向反动党派咨询“是不民主的”。鲜北苏军总司令齐斯卡可夫在历次致霍奇的信中，再三表示苏联愿在莫斯科外长会议中关于朝鲜决定的基础上恢复共同委员会，然而霍奇拒绝了苏方的提议，坚持其修改莫斯科外长会议决定的企图。
