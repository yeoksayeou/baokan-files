　　Feixiang Tianshan Mountain Rectifies Organization
    Village Cadres Collectively Join the Militia
    [Report from our Weixian correspondent] After the struggle in Tianshan Mountain Village, Feixiang, the village cadres immediately held a meeting to discuss the reorganization of the organization. Everyone deeply felt that the relationship between the militia and the farmers' association was not close enough. After investigation, the following reasons were found: (1) Village cadres did not provide enough education and care for the militia. (2) In cooperative work, some militia members showed departmentalism, causing dissatisfaction among the farmers' association. (3) Some backward militia members believed that they had made great contributions and should be allocated more fruits. When the farmers' association could not meet their demands, they became dissatisfied with the farmers' association. Over time, more and more opinions arose, and gradually both sides developed prejudices. During the review, it was discovered that several militia members were controlled by local tyrants and landlords. The village cadres stared vigilantly and said, "Right! We must give good leadership to our militia! If we don't control the armed forces well, our work will be finished." After discussion, it was decided that village cadres who could participate in the militia could join the militia. On the spot, nine people, including the district representative, the director of the farmers' association, and the village head and deputy head, voluntarily signed up to collectively join the militia. Xue Peide, the militia captain, said very happily, "What are we afraid of now? With two village cadres participating in each squad to play a backbone role, it would be a miracle if the militia doesn't do well!"

　　肥乡天台山整顿组织
    村干集体参加民兵
    【本报威县讯】肥乡天台山村斗争结束，村干即开会商讨整理组织，大家都深深感到民兵与农会中间的关系不密切，经过检查有以下几点原因：（一）村干部对民兵教育与照顾上不够。（二）在配合工作上民兵队员有些本位主义，引起农会对民兵的不满。（三）有些落后的民兵，认为自己功劳大，应多批些果实。农会不能满足自己的要求时，对农会不满意。日久意见越来越多，双方慢慢的有了成见。在检讨中发现了几个民兵叫恶霸地主所掌握，村干都瞪着眼睛警惕的说：“对！咱们民兵可得好好的领导领导啊！武装掌握不好，工作就完了。”大家商讨的结果，能参加民兵的村干部都可参加到民兵里去，当场就有小区代表、农会主任，正副村长等九个人自动报名集体参加民兵。民兵队长薛培德非常喜欢的说：“这还怕啥，每班参加两个村干起骨干作用，民兵再搞不好，那才有鬼呢！”
