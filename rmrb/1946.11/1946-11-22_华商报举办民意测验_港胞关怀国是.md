Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 16th: Hong Kong dispatch: The Hong Kong Hua Shang Pao has been conducting a public opinion poll since the 21st of last month, posing four major questions regarding the US military's attitude towards the civil war in China; whether the national affairs opinions of Mr. Chen Jiageng, a leader of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, who requested the withdrawal of US troops and the cessation of aid to Chiang Kai-shek, can represent the majority of overseas Chinese; and views on the current Chinese economic crisis. As of the 31st of last month, the newspaper received answers from 3,347 people, including workers, farmers, merchants, students, freelance professionals, apprentices, primary and secondary school teachers, shop assistants, coolies, military personnel, peddlers, rickshaw pullers, and civil servants, ranging in age from a nine-year-old newsboy to people in their nineties.

Only two people believed that it had no impact on China's sovereignty, accounting for 0.05 percent. Regarding the second question, 3,577 people opposed the civil war and demanded the restoration of the January ceasefire order and troop positions, accounting for 95.5 percent of the total.
