    Why is the United States Seizing the Yuehan Railway?

    Advisory for Readers
    Please Readers Advise;
    Everyone has questions, just ask them. If you don't understand, ask everyone again.

    Question: Dear Editors:

    I saw the news on the front page of your newspaper on November 14th that Chiang Kai-shek sold the Yuehan Railway in exchange for a $50 million loan. I also know that this is part of Chiang Kai-shek's act of national betrayal, but I still have some questions about this matter that I don't understand. Please take the time to guide me: (1) Why did the United States give Chiang Kai-shek money and then come to China to build railways? Why does the United States want to build the Yuehan Railway first? (2) Was the Yuehan Railway built by China itself in the past? Wasn't the train already running a long time ago? Why is it being rebuilt? With best regards,

                  Reader Tao Jingye

  Answer: Comrade Jingye:

    We greatly admire your concern for current affairs and your carefulness in learning. The questions you raised are indeed quite important; now, to the best of our knowledge, the answers are below:

    China's railway construction began after the Sino-Japanese War of 1895. From the beginning, it fully demonstrated the nature of a semi-colonial country. Most of the railways were laid under the coercion and enticement of the imperialists. The imperialists' reason for lending money to China's ruling class to build railways was definitely not to make travel and transportation convenient for the Chinese people, but to seize China's rights and suck the blood of the Chinese people. The United States' inducement to buy the construction rights of the Yuehan Railway is naturally part of a plan to turn China into a colony. On the eve of its economic crisis, it has even more economic plans. On the one hand, it can use it to export surplus capital and sell railway equipment at high prices; after completion, it will serve as a land-based blood vessel for dumping American goods into the Chinese interior. On the other hand, it can exchange unequal amounts of agricultural raw materials such as tung oil from southern China in large quantities from the Chinese interior. It can also exploit and transport the minerals along the route, such as tungsten in southern Jiangxi. Now that Chiang Kai-shek has just signed the "Sino-U.S. Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation" with the United States, isn't this similar to Japan's active construction of railways in North China under the open deception of "Sino-Japanese Friendship and Economic Cooperation" in the past?

    The United States has been trying to get its hands on the Yuehan Railway not just today. When the Yuehan Railway project was planned in 1898 (the 24th year of the Guangxu reign), the American imperialists came forward through the American He Xing Company and moved the minister to the United States, Wu Tingfang, to sign a loan treaty in Washington in April of that year. However, due to the active opposition of the people of Guangdong, Hubei, and Hunan provinces, Li Hongzhang was forced to negotiate with the American minister in August 1905, compensating US$6.7 million and recovering the road rights. Later, the Qing government borrowed money from Germany, Britain, and France, and the United States again demanded a share, so a four-nation loan contract was established in the third year of the Xuantong reign (1911), and construction was carried out in sections. It was not until the Revolution of 1911, when the people loudly shouted "Recover our rights!", that the people of Hunan and Guangdong borrowed money to redeem it. However, China unfortunately produced a great disaster star - Yuan Shikai, who, in order to realize the dream of military unification and "one family under heaven," successively concluded many traitorous railway loan contracts with imperialists, selling a total of 15,000 kilometers of railway lines. At this time, the United States took the opportunity to seize the Zhuzhou-Qinzhou and Gu-Xiang lines, and the Yuehan Railway was also under the control of British forces. After 1927, the Kuomintang reactionaries betrayed the Chinese people and colluded with the imperialists. The Yuehan line was extended from the old two sections, and the entire line was opened to traffic in September 1936, becoming a sharp sword extended by Britain from Hong Kong to the Chinese mainland. Before and after the fall of Guangzhou and Hankou, it was automatically destroyed. After Japan's surrender, although there was no obstruction by the Communist armed forces as Chiang Kai-shek clamored, it was never opened to traffic under the corrupt rule of the Kuomintang. Precisely because there were no People's Armed Forces led by the Communist Party there, Chiang Kai-shek quickly presented the Yuehan Railway to his American father in exchange for "pocket money."

    Why is the United States so eager to seize the Yuehan Railway now? Open the map and take a look: This road is 1,100 kilometers long, starting from Guangzhou in the south and leading directly to Wuhan. Across the river, it connects to the Pinghan Line and is a part of China's only north-south trunk railway. The imperialist claws of the United States seized this road, which is equivalent to the Japanese controlling the South Manchuria Railway. The lifeline that the people shed blood and spent money to redeem was sold out by Chiang. We must resolutely oppose this more thorough sale than that of the Qing Dynasty and Yuan Shikai. The people of the whole country, especially the people of Hunan, Guangdong, and Hubei, should launch another road protection movement and the Revolution of 1911 to overthrow the one-party rule of Chiang.

    美国为什么要抓取粤汉路？

    请读者作顾问；
    大家有问尽管问，不懂再向大家问。
    问：编辑同志：
    在十一月十四日贵报第一版上看到了蒋介石出卖粤汉路，换取五万万美元借款的消息。我也知道这是蒋介石卖国行为的一部分，不过，对这件事我仍然有些问题弄不明白，请您抽空指教：（一）美国为什么给了蒋介石钱反而又来给咱中国修铁路呢？为什么美国要先修粤汉路？（二）粤汉路过去是不是中国自己修的？不是早就通火车了吗，怎么又要修筑？此致
    敬礼
                  读者陶敬业
  答：敬业同志：
    你对时事的关心，对学习的细心，我们都非常敬佩。你提出的问题确实是相当重要的；现在，尽我们所知道的一点，答复在下面：
    我国的铁路建设，始于一八九五年甲午中日战争之后，一开头就充分表现着半殖民地的性质，大部分铁路都是由帝国主义者逼迫劝诱下铺设的。帝国主义者所以要借钱给中国的统治阶级修铁路，决不是为了使中国人民旅行运输便利，而是为了抓取中国的权利，喝中国人的血。美国诱买粤汉路的修筑权，自然是变中国为殖民地计划的一部分。而在她经济危机来临的前夕，更有着经济上的打算。她一方面可以借以输出过剩资本，高价销售铁路器材；修成以后，作为倾销美国商品到中国内地的陆上大吸血管，另一方面，又可以不等价地交换，大批的把南中国的桐油等农业品原料从中国内地运出去。还可以开采运输沿线的矿藏，如江西南的钨之类。现在蒋介石刚和美国订立了“中美友好通商航海条约”，这不正和日本过去在“中日亲善经济提携”的公开骗局下积极修筑着华北各地的铁路相像吗？
    美国想把粤汉铁路弄到手，不自今日始。当一八九八年（光绪二十四年）粤汉路计划兴修的时候，美帝国主义者就由美商合兴公司出头，运动驻美公使吴廷芳，于该年四月在华盛顿订立了借款条约，但是由于广东、湖北、湖南三省人民的积极反对，才迫使李鸿章在一九○五年八月与美国公使谈判，赔偿了美金六百七十万元，把路权收回，后来清廷向德、英、法借款，美国又要求染指，遂在宣统三年（一九一一）成立四国借款合同，分段兴修。直到辛亥革命，人民响亮地喊出了“收回利权！”才由湘粤人民借款赎回。可是，中国不幸出了一个大灾星——袁世凯，为了妄想实现武力统一与“一家天下”的迷梦，接二连三和帝国主义者缔结了许多铁路借款的卖国契约，总共出卖了铁路线一万五千公里，美国这时乘机攫去了株钦、固襄等线，粤汉路同时就又处于英国的势力支配下去了。一九二七年以后，国民党反动派背叛中国人民，与帝国主义者勾结，粤汉线就旧有的两段延长，到一九三六年九月全线通车，成为英国自香港向中国内地伸出的一把利剑。广州汉口失陷前后就自动加以破坏，到日本投降以后，粤汉路上虽并没有如蒋贼所叫嚣的中共武装阻挠，但在国民党腐朽统治下却一直不见通车。也正因为没有中共领导的人民武装在那里，蒋介石很快的就把粤汉铁路奉送给他美国爸爸换“压岁钱”了。
    美国现在为什么急于要抓取粤汉路呢？你打开地图来看看吧：这条路长达一千一百公里，南起广州，直通武汉，隔江和平汉线接起来，是中国唯一的纵贯大铁路的一部。美帝国主义的魔爪抓了这条路在手，就是等于日本人掌握了南满路。人民流血花钱赎回的生命线，一下子给蒋贼出卖净光了。我们要坚决反对这比满清和袁世凯更彻底的出卖，全国人民，特别是湘、粤、鄂的人民应当发动另一次护路运动和辛亥革命，把蒋贼的一党统治打翻在地。
