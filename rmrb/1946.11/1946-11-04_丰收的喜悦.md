　　The Joy of Harvest
    After the autumn harvest in Qiushuyuan Village, Licheng, they calculated the accounts. This year, the total income from both agricultural and sideline production in the village was more than 3,782 shi, of which 514 shi and 7 dou came from increased production due to deep plowing and meticulous farming, 729 shi and 8 dou from improved varieties distributed by the government, and the income from developing sideline production was equivalent to 632 shi and 3 dou of grain. As a result, 162 poor peasant households reached a level of having one unit left over for every two units cultivated, 122 middle peasant households reached a level of having one unit left over for every one unit cultivated, and 23 rich peasant households reached a level of having two units left over for every one unit cultivated. Among them, 13 poor peasant households have risen to the status of middle peasants, and two middle peasant households have risen to the status of prosperous middle peasants. The whole village has reached the level of having one unit left over for every two units cultivated. Looking at the granaries full of grain, the peasants couldn't contain their joy, and their first reaction was: "We benefited from listening to the government." Li Sheng, an honest farmer in his fifties, said that he benefited from listening to the government. Last year, he planted half a mu of cotton and harvested 25 jin (market weight) of clean cotton. This year, he planted one mu and harvested more than 100 jin (seed cotton) weighed with a 24-liang scale. Shen Zhenshan, seeing that others who planted more cotton harvested well, said regretfully: "I missed out this year, I must plant more next year." Wang Xiangqi only planted one and a half mu of Golden Queen corn to try it out, and it was still in poor soil, but he harvested 1.5 shi. The other two mu of native corn, which was in good soil, also only yielded 1.5 shi. He regretted planting too little Golden Queen. Jiang Xiangyan and Lian Musheng both suffered losses this year because they didn't plant Golden Queen corn. They all repeatedly asked others to exchange some good seeds. They said in unison: From now on, we must listen carefully to the government's call. Another reflection was: they regretted not believing in technology and suffered losses. Niu Manshun's half mu of cotton did not sprout, and now he is looking for someone to learn the technique. Song Xiuyuan planted too densely, and Li Butang did not inter-row cultivate, and they all suffered great losses. They all vowed to learn how to grow cotton well next year.
    Secondly, they were very satisfied with mutual aid and setting production plans. The village had a large plan for the whole year and small plans for each month. Even Heqi was unwilling to participate in mutual aid in the past, but this year he joined Lian Chongqi's mutual aid group when planting. He said: "I used to not believe in planning, I thought it was right to do whatever I wanted, what's the use of planning. This year I feel it really works. Every year in summer and autumn we are very busy, and the family is very flustered. This year it is fast and good, step by step, without any confusion." The members of the Yuming group also said: "This year we relied entirely on mutual aid and planning, otherwise we wouldn't have been able to manage. Jiang Fucheng is an old farmer in his fifties who never believed in the benefits of mutual aid. Now he says: "I used to think that mutual aid was useless, but this year I participated in mutual aid, and it really works. Any difficulties can be solved. I don't have livestock, but I was able to plant the land. I was working short-term jobs outside, and the mutual aid group hoed the land for me, so it wasn't left uncultivated." Guo Xingyou also said: "I was sick for more than a year, but nothing was delayed. If it weren't for the mutual aid group, even if I had money to hire people, it wouldn't be as convenient as this." They believe that the wages of the mutual aid group this year are also fair, and the implementation of fixed shares for variable labor is really good. If you can contribute ten points, you get ten points, and if you can contribute eight points, you get eight points. Even children who take care of children (referring to infants) at home are counted as two points. The village's wages also fluctuate with busy and slack seasons. In the spring, repairing the land is four jin of rice per work unit, four and a half jin at planting time, five jin at millet transplanting, seven jin of rice at wheat harvesting and hoeing, and it becomes eight jin at autumn harvesting and autumn planting. Poor households can also owe until after the autumn harvest. Everyone says it's really good.
    There are also two things they are very happy about. One is that every family made money from engaging in sideline production. The members of the Yuming group said: We haven't sold grain this year, but we have already put on new clothes. Now that the autumn harvest is over, it's a good time to engage in spinning, weaving, transportation, and trading! The other is that they learned skills without delaying work. The militia self-defense team members of Wang Jucai's mutual aid team learned martial arts on their own, saving a lot of labor. In the past, they used to gather every few days, which delayed a lot of work. This year, they didn't delay their regular work, and they learned a lot of skills. They can produce, fight, and write and calculate. In the spring, Jucai threw grenades 36 meters, and now he throws 45 meters.
    The whole village is happy and grateful to the government. At the village evening party on October 22nd, Wang Jucai said: "The government's leadership is good. I have reached the level of having one unit left over for every one unit cultivated this year. The soldiers on the front line are sacrificing and bleeding to protect us. I want to hand over one more dou of public grain to support the front line and protect the good times." Everyone was vying to report. Retired soldier Shen Jubao also handed over four dou of grain, and the old man Niu Rentai also voluntarily handed over dozens of jin of public grain to express their support for the government and the army. The whole village handed over an extra 400 jin of rice, 550 jin of grain, and 25 jin of corn, expressing their support for the government and the army.

　　丰收的喜悦
    黎城秋树垣村秋收完成后算了个账，今年全村农副两业总收入是三千七百八十二石多，其中深耕细作增产的是五百十四石七斗，政府发下的优良品种增产的是七百二十九石八，发展副业的收入折合粮食是六百三十二石三斗。这样，一百六十二户贫农达到了耕二余一，一百二十二户中农达到了耕一余一，富农二十三户达到了耕一余二，其中十三户贫农已上升为中农，两户中农上升为富裕中农。全村已达到耕二余一了。看着满囤的粮食，农民们有按捺不住的喜悦，他们的第一个反映是：“听政府话沾了光”。李生是五十多岁的老实农民，他说听政府话沾了光啦，去年栽花半亩，摘了二十五斤（市秤）净花，今年一亩，二十四两秤摘了一百多斤（籽花）。申振山看见人家种花种的多收的好，后悔地说：“今年误了，明年可得多种些。”王祥奇只种了亩半金皇后玉茭试一试，还是坏地，收了石五，另外二亩土玉茭，还是好地，也只收了石五，他后悔金皇后种的太少了。江祥言和连木生今年没有种金皇后玉茭都吃了亏，他们都千吩万咐要求别人给换些好种籽。异口同声地说：今后可得好好听政府的号召。另一个反映是：后悔不相信技术吃了亏，牛满顺半亩花没有出苗，现在找着人学技术。宋秀元种的太稠，李步堂没有打岔，都吃了大亏。都发誓明年要好好学种花。
    其次，他们对互助和订生产计划很感满意。该村今年全年有大计划，月月有小计划。连河奇过去不愿互助，今年下种时才参加了连崇奇的互助组。他说：“我以前就不信计划，不管什做就对啦，计划顶什。今年觉得真是起作用，年年夏天秋天很忙，家人很张惶，今年是又快又好，按步就班，不乱马脚。”玉明组的组员们也说：“今年全凭互助和计划，要不是就顾不过来。江福成是五十多岁的老农民，永不相信互助好，现在他说：“以前我总认为互助不顶事，今年互助了，真顶事，有啥困难都能解决，我没牲口能种上地，我在外边打短工，互助组就给我锄了地，没荒了。”郭兴友也说：“我病了一年多，什也没有误了，要不是凭互助组，就有钱雇人，能像这个便利？”他们认为今年互助组的工资也订得公道，实行死分活计真好，能顶十分就十分，能顶八分就八分，连儿童们在家看孩孩（指婴儿）还算二分。该村工资又是以忙闲涨跌，春天修地每工四斤米，下种时四斤半，拔谷时五斤，割麦锄地时七斤米，秋收秋种时就成了八斤，贫户还可以欠到秋后还。人人反映真好。
    还有两件事他们很高兴，一件是搞副业家家赚了钱。玉明组的组员们说：今年没卖粮食就穿上了新衣服，现在收完了秋，又正好搞纺织、运输、做买卖哩！另一件是没误工学上本事啦。王聚财互助队的民兵自卫队员们，自学练武省工不少。往年是隔几天集中一次，误工挺多。今年没误正工，学的本事可不少，会生产，能打仗，又会写算，聚财春天投弹投三十六米，现在投到四十五米达了。
    一村都高兴，都感谢政府，十月二十二号全村晚会上，王聚财说：“政府领导的好，我今年达到耕一余一了，前方将士牺牲流血保卫咱们，我要多交一斗米的公粮，支援前线，保卫好时光。随着都在争先恐后的报，退伍军人申聚保也交谷四斗，牛仁太老汉也自动多交了几十斤公粮。全村共多交米四百斤，谷五百五十斤，玉茭二十五斤，表示他们拥护政府军队的心情。
