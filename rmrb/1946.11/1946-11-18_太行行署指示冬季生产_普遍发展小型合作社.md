    Taihang Administrative Office Issues Instructions on Winter Production
    Universally Develop Small-Scale Cooperatives
    I. Overcome Speculative Profit-Seeking Views
    II. Cannot Annex Small Cooperatives
    III. Clear Up External Debts and Expand Share Capital
    [Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] In order to support small-scale cooperatives and lead the large-scale winter production movement this year, the Taihang Administrative Office has issued a special circular, in addition to notifying all special counties to quickly rectify village-level cooperatives, and specifically raises the following issues and preliminary opinions regarding the current problems existing in cooperatives throughout the region:

    First, overcome speculative profit-seeking views and establish a correct business direction. Since 1944, cooperatives have made considerable progress in combining agricultural and sideline industries and handicrafts, but the ideology of speculation and profit-seeking has not been completely resolved. For example, among the 37 cooperatives in Huixian County, 16 are solely engaged in general merchandise, 13 are mainly engaged in general merchandise, and 8 are engaged in handicrafts. Cooperatives engaged in buying and selling speculation in the Third District account for 75.2 percent. This practice of simply pursuing profits arose from the fluctuating prices in the first half of this year. The practices of these cooperatives should be overcome immediately, and they should learn from good cooperatives, such as the Cao Ting Cooperative in Zuoquan County. It started by running an oil mill based on the needs of the masses, and then engaged in spinning, weaving, transportation, sheep raising, pig raising, etc., earning the reputation of being "our cooperative" from the masses. This is the correct business direction for cooperatives.

    Second, small cooperatives must not be annexed. In places like Zuoquan and Shexian counties, "cooperative certificates" were used to merge small cooperatives into large cooperatives; in some areas, "business licenses" were forcibly issued to restrict their development, and in individual areas, they were simply "swallowed up." Their argument is that "large cooperatives are better than small cooperatives," and "small cooperatives will bring down large cooperatives." As a result, after the vinegar workshop of the masses in Ganlu Rock, Xiangyuan, was "merged," it affected the collapse of Zhang Maoxi's mutual aid society. Zhang Maoxi said to the district cadres, "If you can guarantee that there will be no more mergers in the future, we will start again immediately." Some people said, "The higher-ups are calling on us to produce, why don't they let us run small cooperatives?" This shows that the masses like small cooperatives, and confirms that the "merger" policy of large cooperatives is not in line with the mass line and is wrong. The correct relationship between large and small cooperatives should be complementary. For example, the Caojiaping Large Cooperative in Xiangyuan solved the difficulties of manpower and capital for the Xiying Mutual Aid Society, and also sold salt on behalf of the Mutual Aid Society. The Gongdao Mutual Aid Society also purchased goods from the Dianshang Cooperative and promoted finished products to each other. Another good example is holding regular meetings of managers of large and small cooperatives to solve production coordination issues. The correct relationship between large and small cooperatives is a very important issue in the correct business direction. Small cooperatives should be developed boldly and universally to organize the comprehensive production of the masses.

    Third, clear up external debts and expand share capital. The phenomenon of external debts in cooperatives in various places is still serious. The external debts of 58 cooperatives in Xiangyuan reached 1,287,000 yuan, accounting for 47.7 percent of the total share capital. Therefore, many cooperatives have collapsed because they are unable to circulate their business due to excessive external debts. Therefore, clearing up external debts and rectifying funds should be given sufficient attention. The method of clearing up external debts should start from organizing production and "contracting to repay debts," and should not adopt a simple "demanding and recovering debts" approach. Expanding share capital will give cooperatives a strong economic strength and enable them to better serve production. The goal of Licheng to expand the share capital of cooperatives to 100 million yuan is correct. However, some cooperatives, such as the Shibai Xiaodian Mutual Aid Society in Xiangyuan, stipulate that each person's share capital is 1,000 yuan, and no more; the Cizhou Kiln of the Majiaguai Labor Society in Zuoquan County is afraid of absorbing share capital to build a large kiln and restricts shareholding, etc., which are all wrong. If this continues, it will affect the development of industry and commerce. Regarding the absorption of share capital, we should also start from actively organizing mass production. We should combine the sale of products on consignment, profit sharing and expansion of shares, and in-kind contributions. "Apportionment," "levies," and the extraction of the fruits of struggle and other methods of raising funds must be absolutely avoided.

    In addition, improving the organization of cooperatives and strengthening leadership are also important. Such as rectifying the formalistic supervisory boards, organizing cooperative committees for various industries; overcoming the shortcomings of cooperatives being too detached from production personnel and becoming bureaucratic; strengthening the education of cooperative cadres, and not assigning cadres with poor understanding who "cannot be placed" to cooperatives. On the issue of the treatment of cadres and workers, we should immediately overcome methods such as the "supply system" and the "wage system," and adopt "labor-capital profit sharing" to improve the enthusiasm of the staff.

### 太行行署指示冬季生产  普遍发展小型合作社

    太行行署指示冬季生产
    普遍发展小型合作社
    一、克服投机营利观点
    二、不能吞并小合作社
    三、清理外欠扩大股金
    【本报特讯】为了扶植小型合作社，领导今年冬季大规模生产运动，太行行署特发表通报，除通知各专县应迅速整顿村单位合作社外，特提出目前全区合作社中存在的几个问题及初步意见如下：
    第一、克服投机营利观点，树立正确业务方向。四四年来，合作社在农副、手工业结合上有不少进步，但投机营利思想，仍未完全解决。如辉县三十七个合作社中，单纯经营杂货者有十六个，经营杂货为主者十三个，经营手工业者八个。三分区从事买卖投机的合作社竟占百分之七十五点二。这种单纯追逐利润的作法是由今年前半年物价时涨时落而产生的，这些合作社的作法应即克服，应该向好的合作社学习：如左权草亭合作社，它一开始就以群众的要求而办油房，继而搞纺织、运输、养羊、喂猪等。获得群众呼为“我们的合作社”的声誉。这是合作社正确的业务方向。
    第二、不能吞并小型合作社。左权、涉县等地用“合作证”将小型合作社并为大合作社的一部分；有的地区强令领“营业证”以限制其发展，个别地区干脆“吞”掉。他们的论据是：“大合作社比小合作社好”，“小合作社会把大合作社发展垮台”。结果把襄垣甘露岩群众的醋房“并”后，影响张茂喜的互助社垮台；张茂喜向区干部说：“你能保证今后不再合并，我们马上又搞”。有群众说：“上级号召我们生产，为啥不让我们搞小合作社？”这说明群众喜爱小合作社，证实大合作社的“合并”政策是非群众路线的，是错的。大、小合作社的正确关系应该是相辅相成。如襄垣曹家坪大合作社给西营互助社解决人力与资金困难，又从互助社捎卖盐。宫道互助社亦与店上合作社互相采购货物，又互相推销成品。又如定期开大、小合作社经理会议以解决配合生产问题等都是好的范例。大、小合作社的正确关系在正确业务方向上是很重要的问题，应该放手而普遍的发展小型合作社，把群众的全面生产组织起来。
    第三、清理外欠与扩大股金。各地合作社外欠现象仍属严重。襄垣五十八个合作社的外欠达一百二十八万七千余元，占总股金的百分之四十七点七。因此，不少合作社因外欠过多，营业不能周转而垮台了。所以清理外欠，整顿基金应引起足够注意。而清理外欠方法又应从组织生产，“包工还账”着手，不能采单纯“要债索债”做法。扩大股金使合作社有雄厚的经济力量，更能为生产服务。黎城提出要扩大合作社股金一万万元的奋斗目标是对的。而某些合作社如襄垣史北小店互助社规定每人股金一千元，多一元不行；左权马家拐劳动社的磁窑怕吸收股金搞大磁窑而限制入股等，都是错误的。发展下去，将影响工商业的发展。关于吸收股金，亦应从积极组织群众生产着手。应该代卖生产品，分红与扩股结合及实物入股等。“分派”、“摊派”及抽用斗争果实等集股办法绝对避免。
    此外，改进合作社组织与加强领导也是重要的。如整顿形式主义的监理事会，组织各业合作委员会；克服合作社脱离生产人员过多、机关化的缺点；加强合作社干部教育，不要把认识差而“没法安置”的干部派到合作社去。在干部、工人待遇等问题上应即克服“供给制”“工资制”等办法，采用“劳资分红”以提高工作人员的积极性。
