Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd: New York dispatch: After more than a week of general debate, the United Nations General Assembly officially began the work of its various committees on the 1st. The meeting place has moved from the General Assembly site in Flushing Meadow Park to the former wartime factory at Lake Success, Long Island. Three committees met on the 1st. At the meeting of the Fifth Committee (Administrative and Budgetary Committee), the US representative Vandenberg strongly rejected the US bearing half of the UN's total budget. At the first meeting of the First Committee (Political and Security Committee) on the 2nd, Afghanistan, Sweden, and Iceland were unanimously accepted as member states of the United Nations. It is reported that major issues such as dealing with Franco, Australia's attempt to amend the five-power veto in the Charter, and general disarmament, may be discussed by the Political and Security Committee next week. The issue of controlling atomic energy will be discussed later.

    【新华社延安三日电】纽约讯：联合国大会经过一周以上的一般性辩论后，已自一日起正式开始大会各委员会的工作。会场已自草滨公园大会会址移至长岛成功湖前战时工厂。一日开会的有三个委员会，在第五委员会（行政预算委员会）会上，美代表范登堡强烈拒绝美国担负的占联合国全部预算一半的经费。第一委员会（政治安全委员会）二日首次会议上，已一致接受阿富汗、瑞典、冰岛三国为联合国会员国。据悉对付佛朗哥与澳洲力图修改宪章中五强否决权及普遍裁军等主要问题，可能在下周由政治与安全委员会讨论。而管制原子能问题，将延至更迟讨论。
