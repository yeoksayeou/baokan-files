Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 14th: Comprehensive reports from various newspapers reveal that corruption and embezzlement by personnel at all levels of the Kuomintang military system in the process of receiving enemy and puppet materials have been rampant since August, as disclosed by the "Investigation Teams." This is the case everywhere from Nanjing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Nanchang, Beiping, Tianjin, Guangzhou, the Northeast, and Wuhan.

In Shanghai, the "Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui District Investigation Team" declared that the most people had reported corruption cases in Shanghai's receiving agencies against the Third Front Army (Tang Enbo's troops). Lü Shishang, a minor official and head of the Materials Group of the Receiving Committee within that unit, embezzled as much as 50 billion yuan. The Chiang government concealed this from the public, and it was not until the end of October this year that the Executive Yuan ordered an "investigation" into this "fly." In addition, He Yingqin "seized" a large number of houses in Shanghai, but the "Investigation Team" and other agencies did not intervene. Regarding the "seizure" cases in the Nanjing military system, the "Investigation Team" only exposed a small clerk at a military station. According to the Jingda Gang Bao, the Investigation Team had a "hidden pain" regarding the corruption of other senior military and political officials; "no comment is better than a comment." Hangzhou was received by the troops of Gu Zhutong, Commander-in-Chief of the Third War Zone. After the "Investigation Team's" investigation, it stated: "In the minds of the people of Zhejiang, their 'thoughts of departure' (meaning asking him to 'get out') for a certain Commander-in-Chief's headquarters probably will not fade away even after dozens or hundreds of years." Regarding the Nanchang corruption case, according to the Shanghai Dagong Bao, the person in charge of the "Forward Command Post" there was Lu Daoyuan, commander of the 58th Army, and the person in charge of the war zone was Xue Boling (i.e., Xue Yue). They are now in Xuzhou and the Northeast, making it impossible to investigate. In the Beiping-Tianjin area, Mou Tingfang, commander of the 94th Army, embezzled as much as 200 billion yuan, but the Beiping-Tianjin Investigation Team did not dare to intervene. The team only investigated Liu Naiyi, a minor naval captain, but Liu also embezzled 5 billion yuan worth of enemy and puppet materials. The Associated Press reported that a certain general in charge of "receiving" embezzled enough military equipment for two divisions. The American-equipped New First Army, formerly in Guangzhou, was given "whatever they wanted" by Chen Cheng's special order to the Guangzhou Military and Special Office. Among the embezzlement within that unit were four large boxes of opium, worth a total of 500 million yuan in legal tender; Mo Shuo, a special commissioner of the Ministry of Military Affairs in Guangzhou, embezzled 177 boxes of opium, worth a total of more than 22 billion yuan. The Chiang army leaders "receiving" in the Northeast thought that the "Investigation Team" really wanted to investigate their misdeeds. According to the Shanghai Xinwen Bao, they even sent more than 20 armed soldiers in Shenyang to block Jin Yu, a member of the Investigation Team, and threaten him. Regarding the "seizure" by the Chiang army in Wuhan, the "Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi District Investigation Team" stated: "Many of the Wuhan receiving troops have gone elsewhere, making it impossible to investigate." However, Sun Ziying, the engineering battalion commander of the 75th Division, a "fly" that was swatted in that area, embezzled as much as 2 billion yuan.

    在上海方面，据“苏浙皖区清查团”宣称，沪市各接收机关的舞弊案，人民密告者，以第三方面军（汤恩伯部）为最多。该部小小官员接收委员物资组长吕师尚，贪污即达五百亿元。蒋政府掩蔽人民耳目，直到今年十月底行政院始下令“审查”此一“苍蝇”。此外，何应钦在沪“劫收”大批房屋，“清查团”及其他机关均未过问。南京军事系统之“劫收”案，“清查团”只揭发一兵站小职员，对于其他军政大员的贪污，据京大刚报称，清查团有“隐痛”，“无话比有话好”。杭州系由第三战区司令长官顾祝同部接收，据“清查团”清查后称：“某司令长官部在全浙江人民的心目中，对他们的‘去思’（即叫他‘滚蛋’之意），恐怕经过数十百年不能磨灭。”南昌贪污案，据沪大公报载，该处“前进指挥所”负责人是五十八军军长鲁道源，战区负责人是薛伯陵（即薛岳），现在徐州与东北，无法清查。平津方面，九十四军军长牟廷芳，贪污达二千亿元，平津清查团不敢过问。该团仅查办了一个小小海军上校刘乃沂，但刘也贪污了五十亿元的敌伪物资。美联社称某办理“接收”的将官贪污军械足够两师人之用。前在广州的美械新一军是经陈诚特令广州军特处对之“要什么给什么”的，该部的贪污中，有鸦片四大箱，共值法币五亿元；军政部广州特派员莫硕贪污鸦片一七七箱，共值二百二十余亿元。东北“接收”的蒋军首领们以为“清查团”真要清查他们的劣迹，据沪新闻报载，他们竟派二十余武装兵在沈阳拦住清查团员金毓黼要胁他。武汉方面，蒋军的“劫收”，据“湘鄂赣区清查团”称：“武汉接收部队多开往他处，无法清查。”而该区打的武装“苍蝇”七十五师工兵营长孙子英等，贪污竟达二十余亿元。
