　　Hatched 28 Broods of Chicks in Ten Months, Earning 6,000 Yuan
    Old Man Dong Gets Rich Raising Chickens
    Gains Experience: Light Eggs Hatch Hens
    [This newspaper, Changzhi News] Dong Yuting, a 68-year-old man from Houmu Village, Erqu, Yushe, has hatched 28 broods of chicks since January this year, totaling 646 chicks. He sold each chick for 15 yuan, earning a total of 8,630 yuan. After deducting the original cost of the eggs, he made a net profit of 6,238 yuan, which is enough to sustain his livelihood. In the year of hatching chicks, he gained two points of experience. First, weigh the eggs with a scale, the light ones are hens, and the heavy ones are roosters. In April of this year, a brood hatched 22 eggs, 19 of which were less than one tael, and one was more than one and a half taels, marked in red and black. When the chicks came out, they were recorded with black and white thread. When the chicks grew up, indeed 19 were hens and three were roosters. Second, if you want to make the hen "leave the nest" and hatch more chicks, just don't take the eggs she lays from the nest for three or four days. If an old hen doesn't wake up after hatching two or three broods of chicks in a row, feed her some chili peppers and vinegar and she will wake up. He now also raises seven hens and one pig, and plans to raise a large number of chickens and feed pigs next year. Recently, he was elected as the village's chicken-raising hero and is preparing to participate in the county's conference of heroes. (Zhao Bing'an, Shi Kuiyuan)

　　十个月孵鸡廿八窝赚洋六千
    董老汉养鸡发财
    获得经验蛋轻的出母鸡
    【本报长治讯】榆社二区候目村，六十八岁老汉董玉亭，从今年正月到现在一共孵小鸡二八窝，共六百四十六只，每只卖洋十五元，共卖洋八千六百三十元。除了鸡蛋的原本，净赚洋六千二百三十八元，足够维持自己生活。他在一年的孵小鸡中，得出两点经验。一、用称称鸡蛋，轻的是母鸡，重的是公鸡。今年四月间一窝孵了二十二个鸡蛋，十九个一两以下的，一个一两半以上的，用红黑色标出来。小鸡出来用黑白线记着，小鸡长大了，果然十九个是母鸡，三个是公鸡。二、想使母鸡“落窝”，多孵小鸡，只要三四天不从窝里取其所产鸡蛋就行。如果老鸡一连孵两三窝小鸡还不醒，给它吃些辣椒和醋就醒了。他现在还养着母鸡七只，猪一口，计划明年还要大量养鸡喂猪。最近他已当选全村养鸡英雄，准备参加县群英会。  （赵秉安、石奎元）
