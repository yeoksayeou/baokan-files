[Report from our newspaper in Neiqiu] In order to strive to completely finish land reform this winter, Neiqiu County is now deeply carrying out the overturn-the-body checkup movement in thirty-seven administrative villages and has gained preliminary experience. After the checkup and overturn-the-body movement went deep into various villages, it was discovered in Damo Village that there were still six major despots who had not been thoroughly struggled against; in Bali Village, North Street, and South Street, there were unfair phenomena in the distribution of fruits; there were uncoordinated phenomena among cadres, among the masses, and between cadres and the masses; in Silitun, Beishuangliu, and other villages, it was discovered that there were cases of despots infiltrating farmers' associations, militia, and other organizations to carry out sabotage. After the above-mentioned problems were discovered, they were immediately thoroughly resolved, and the organizations were strengthened, which greatly promoted the movement. The following preliminary experiences were gained:

Experience

I. The main focus of the checkup is on several major issues, such as whether the despots have been overthrown, whether the distribution of fruits is fair, whether the organizations are sound, and whether ideological awareness has been raised. II. The checkup should be combined with struggle and problem-solving, and should not be conducted for the sake of checking up. It is necessary to deeply discover problems and then solve them. III. The checkup must be a mass checkup. Launching the checkup is also a process of mobilizing the masses. It is still necessary to carry out speaking bitterness or making suggestions. It is essential to avoid turning it into a checkup and discussion by a few people. Xincheng Village has achieved a mass checkup movement of organizing self-checkups and mutual checkups, which has yielded great results. For example, Liu Jiuzi did not overturn his body, and he did not find the reason for himself. As a result, others helped him pour out his grievances and overturn his body. IV. Internal problems among cadres, among the masses, and between each other should be handled carefully, in the spirit of resolving knots and washing faces.

　　争取今冬彻底完成土地改革
    内邱进行翻身大检查
    发现还有大恶霸没斗彻底，并混入农会民兵组织，果实分配不公等问题。
    【本报内邱讯】本县为争取今冬彻底完成土地改革，现翻身大检查运动已在三十七个行政村深入开展，并获得初步经验。检查翻身运动在各村深入后，大磨窝发现还有六户大恶霸没有斗彻底；八里庄、北街、南街的果实分配存在着不公平现象，干部间，群众间，干部与群众间存在着不调协的现象；在四里屯、北双流等村发现有恶霸混入农会，民兵等组织进行破坏的事情。当上述各种问题发现后，都立刻作了彻底的解决，健全了组织，使运动大大的推进了一步。并获得以下几点初步经验：
    经验
    一、主要从恶霸是否斗垮，果实分配是否公道，组织是否健全，思想觉悟是否提高等几个主要问题上进行检查。二、检查要与斗争和解决问题结合，不要为检查而检查，深入发现问题，跟着加以解决。三、检查必须是群众性的大检查，发动检查也是发动群众的过程，仍需进行诉苦或提意见，切忌变成几个人检查和发议论，新城村作到了组织自己检查互相检查的群众性检查运动，收效很大，如刘久子没翻身，自己也没检查出原因，结果，别人帮助他倒出了苦水翻了身。四、干部间，群众间及互相间的内部问题要慎重的，以解圪瘩和洗脸的精神解决。
