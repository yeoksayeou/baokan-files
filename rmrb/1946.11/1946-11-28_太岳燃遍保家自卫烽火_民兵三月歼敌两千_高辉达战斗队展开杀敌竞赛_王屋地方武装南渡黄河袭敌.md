[Reported from Taiyue on the 26th of this month] For three months, the people along the Taiyue Tongpu Railway have, in order to defend the fruits of their liberation and counterattack the large-scale invasion of Chiang's troops, universally ignited the flames of self-defense and counterattack in the vast area of hundreds of miles, from Jiexiu in the north to the Yellow River in the south. Whether Chiang's troops are attacking or defending, they can inflict significant casualties on Chiang's troops with clever tactics such as ambushes, surprise attacks, explosions, and sniper fire. Numerous combat heroes have emerged among the militiamen, creating countless touching historical facts. For example, the Gao Huida fighting team of Hong and Zhao, eight people annihilating eighty enemies in one month, has become a glorious banner among the people's armed forces. Currently, in order to defend the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, they have launched a kill-the-enemy competition to inflict greater blows on the invaders. From July to September, according to incomplete statistics from the Armed Forces Committee, the Taiyue militiamen fought 484 battles, killing, wounding, and capturing 1,962 Chiang's troops, seizing 809 rifles, 15 machine guns, 23 grenade launchers, 8 portable launchers, 4 mortars, 1 rocket launcher, 1 hand cannon, 25 boxes of shells, 1,236 catties of cut telegraph wires, 78 destroyed碉堡 [diāobǎo, pillboxes], more than 49,400 rounds of ammunition, and countless other military supplies.

[Reported from Taiyue on the 26th of this month] The Chiang's and puppet forces entrenched in Kuangluo, Xiwu and other places under the jurisdiction of Xin'an County on the south bank of the Yellow River, in order to cooperate with the invasion of the Chiang's and puppet troops in the Ji-Meng area, frequently sent special agents and bandit armed forces to launch sneak attacks on our Wangwu area, attempting to destroy our democratic government and militia. After their invasion of northern Henan, our Wangwu local armed forces dispatched a part of the guerrilla forces on November 16 to cross the Yellow River and attack the puppet troops in Xiwu. The puppet self-defense regiment guarding the area was routed by us, capturing more than 20 rifles and 3 puppet soldiers. Two large boats used by the enemy to launch sneak attacks across the river were also seized by us.

    王屋地方武装南渡黄河袭敌
    【本报太岳二十六日电】三个月来，我太岳同蒲沿线人民，为保卫翻身果实，回击蒋军的大举进犯，北自介休，南迄黄河，数百里广大的土地上，普遍燃烧起自卫反击烽火，不论蒋军在进攻或守备，他们均能以伏击、奇袭、爆炸、冷枪等巧妙战术，给蒋军以重大杀伤。民兵中并涌现了无数的战斗英雄，创造了不知多少可歌可泣的史实。如洪、赵的高辉达战斗队，八个人一月歼敌八十名，成为人民武装中一面光辉旗帜。目前为了保卫陕甘宁边区，他们更展开了杀敌竞赛运动，给进犯者以更大打击。自七月到九月三个月来，武委总会根据不完全的统计，我太岳民兵共作战四百八十四次，毙伤俘蒋军一千九百六十二人，缴获步枪八百零九支，机枪十五挺，掷弹筒二十三个，手提式八挺，迫击炮四门，火箭炮一门，手炮一门，炮弹二十五箱，割电线一千二百三十六斤，平毁碉堡七十八座，子弹四万九千四百余发，其他军用品无算。
    【本报太岳二十六日电】盘据黄河南岸新安县属狂骆、西沃等地之蒋伪，为配合济孟地区蒋伪军之进犯，经常派遣特务及土匪武装，向我王屋地区偷袭，企图摧毁我民主政权及民兵。我王屋地方武装，于其侵入豫北之后，于十一月十六日，分遣一部游击部队，南渡黄河，袭击西沃伪军。守备该地之伪自卫团当为我击溃，计缴获步枪二十余支，俘伪军三名，该敌用以向我渡河偷袭之大船两只，亦被我缴获。
