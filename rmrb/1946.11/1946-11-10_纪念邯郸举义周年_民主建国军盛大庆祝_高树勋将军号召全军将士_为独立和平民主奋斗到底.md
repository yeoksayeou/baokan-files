　　Commemorating the Anniversary of the Handan Uprising
    Democratic National Construction Army Holds Grand Celebration
    General Gao Shuxun Calls on All Officers and Soldiers
    To Fight to the End for Independence, Peace, and Democracy
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] "Commemorate the Handan Uprising, adhere to peace and democracy, and oppose civil war and dictatorship!" This was the magnificent roar unanimously issued by all officers and soldiers of the Democratic National Construction Army at the anniversary celebration of the Handan Uprising on the 5th. At 4:00 PM that afternoon, all officers and soldiers of the Democratic National Construction Army and more than 30,000 people from nearby resident areas, passed through a colorful archway with a huge portrait of General Gao Shuxun hanging, and entered the venue in an orderly manner. On the rostrum hung the national flag and huge portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and congratulatory banners presented by various organizations were displayed all over the rostrum and its sides. Before the meeting began, the procession of people offering condolences circled the rostrum once, with the villagers leading cattle and carrying wine, carrying burdens on their shoulders and donkeys, passing by hurriedly for thirty minutes. In the troops, thunderous applause erupted, and slogans such as "Defend the interests of the people's liberation" resounded throughout. After the meeting began with the sound of cannons, representatives of the local people first presented a banner to Commander-in-Chief Gao, followed by a speech by Chairman Gao, who stated in an excited and joyful tone that "On this day last year, the Democratic National Construction Army refused Chiang Kai-shek's order for civil war and withdrew from the civil war vortex," pointing out that "When the Democratic National Construction Army held its founding meeting at this time last year, it was warmly welcomed by the masses, and our troops felt quite ashamed; because before the uprising, the New Eighth Army and the Hebei People's Army violated the interests of the people and devastated the liberated areas. Now the Democratic National Construction Army safeguards the interests of the people and has become the people's armed force, therefore, the morale of the troops is very high." General Gao also used the different facts of his personal experiences a year ago and after to give a profound description of the two different regions of the Chiang-occupied area and the liberated area. After recounting the various tragic situations of the Chiang-occupied area in military, political, economic... aspects, he angrily denounced "Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous crimes of doing everything possible to oppress and exploit the majority of the people, and not hesitating to give all sovereignty to American imperialism, he is a traitor, an emperor's puppet!" Finally, General Gao specially called on all officers and soldiers of the army to "be determined, work harder, follow Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and fight to the end for the independence, liberation, peace, democracy, and prosperity of all of China, eliminate all domestic reactionaries, and completely abolish all American aggression and oppression against our country." At this time, the slogans "Commemorate the Handan Uprising, implement General Gao's instructions, and defeat the Chiang-American reactionaries" were shouted from the stage, lasting for a long time.

　　纪念邯郸举义周年
    民主建国军盛大庆祝
    高树勋将军号召全军将士
    为独立和平民主奋斗到底
    【本报特讯】“纪念邯郸举义，坚持和平民主，反对内战独裁”，这是民主建国军全体将士在五日庆祝邯郸举义周年纪念大会上，一致发出的雄伟的吼声。是日下午四时，民建军全体将士暨驻地附近群众三万余人，行经悬有高树勋将军巨幅画像的彩门，鱼贯进入会场。主席台上高悬国旗及毛主席，朱总司令巨像，各机关团体赠送的贺幛，布满主席台及其两旁。开会前，群众慰劳的行列在主席台前绕行一周，老乡们牵牛携酒，肩担驴驮，匆匆走过，为时达三十分钟。部队中则万掌齐鸣，“保卫人民翻身利益”的口号响成一片。鸣炮开会后，驻地群众代表首先向高总司令献旗，继由主席高总司令讲话，他以兴奋愉快的语调，申述“去年今日民主建国军拒绝蒋介石的内战乱命，退出内战漩涡”，指出：“当去年此时民建军召开成立大会时，受到群众的热烈的欢迎，我们的部队是感到相当的惭愧的；因为在举义以前，新八军及河北民军是违背人民利益，摧残解放区的。现在民主建国军维护人民的利益，已经变成了人民的武力，因此，部队情绪就显得十分昂扬了。”高将军并以一年前后切身经历的不同事实，对蒋占区及解放区两个不同的区域加以深刻的描述，他在历述蒋占区军事、政治、经济……各种悲惨情况后，痛斥“蒋介石的这种为了尽一切力量压迫剥削大多数人民，不惜把全部主权送给美帝国主义的卖国罪行，是汉奸、是儿皇帝！”最后，高将军特号召全军将士“下定决心，加倍努力，跟随毛主席、朱总司令，为全中国的独立解放和平民主富强奋斗到底，肃清国内的一切反动派，把美国对我国的一切侵略压迫全部取消。”此时台下高呼“纪念邯郸起义，实行高总司令指示，打败蒋美反动派”的口号，历久不息。
