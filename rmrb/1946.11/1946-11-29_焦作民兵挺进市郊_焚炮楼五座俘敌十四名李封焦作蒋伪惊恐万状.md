　　Jiaozuo Militia Advances into Suburbs
    Five Blockhouses Burned, Fourteen Enemies Captured; Li Feng and Jiaozuo Chiang's Troops in Panic
    【Changzhi, 26th Dispatch】The Chiang's puppet troops besieged in Jiaozuo are very panicked by the constant attacks of our militia. At night, the enemies in the outer blockhouses retreat back to the city. On the nights of the 13th and 14th of this month, our Jiaozuo militia work team, in coordination with the troops, advanced into the suburbs, burned five enemy blockhouses, and captured fourteen enemy puppets. On the night of the 13th, the Jiaozuo First District militia work team, in coordination with the town's public security team, a total of more than 40 people, attacked the enemy in the Longyan River area and leveled their first and second blockhouses. The following night, two platoons of the district militia, in coordination with a unit of the public security team, attacked Yan River again, burning down the enemy's fourth and fifth major blockhouses. These four major blockhouses are located on the northern hills of the Chiang's army's outer strongholds in Jiaoshi, such as Yan River, Shijian, and Shangbaizuo villages. They are three zhang in height and width, full of gun holes, and can accommodate about two rows of people up and down. The outer moat is made of stone and is three chi deep. After the enemy occupied Jiaozuo, they forcibly grabbed laborers for more than half a month to build them, vainly attempting to cut off our connection between the plains and the mountains. When we set them on fire, the lights in Li Feng were completely extinguished, and the enemy was in extreme panic. The Yang Juhe militia work team also divided into two routes that night in coordination with the ×× team to attack Tazhang, surrounded the puppet self-defense regiment, captured fourteen puppet members alive, seized two guns, and burned down one blockhouse. On the night of the 15th, the First District militia work team again covered the masses to rush to transport public grain for three consecutive nights. The enemy discovered this, but our militia had been prepared. Before the enemy arrived, they laid mines on the Gaoyao River ridge. On the 16th, the enemy indeed came to attack and three of them were killed by the explosion. Later, the enemy surrounded our militia's station in Shuangbochi, but returned empty-handed.

　　焦作民兵挺进市郊
    焚炮楼五座俘敌十四名李封焦作蒋伪惊恐万状
    【长治二十六日电】困守焦作之蒋伪军在我民兵不断袭击下，甚感恐慌。入夜，其外围炮楼之敌即撤回市内。本月十三、四两夜我焦作民兵武工队配合部队挺进市郊，烧敌炮楼五座，俘敌伪十四名。十三日夜，焦作一区民兵武工队配合镇市公安队共四十余人出龙阎河一带敌人，并平毁其第一、二两个炮楼。次日晚，该区民兵两个班配合公安队一部再袭阎河，烧毁敌第四、五两大炮楼。该四大炮楼位于焦市蒋军外围据点阎河、狮涧、上白作等村北山头上，高宽各三丈满布枪眼，约容两排人上下，石头筑成外壕，深达三尺。敌占焦作后，强抓民夫半月余始修成，妄图切断我平原山地之联络。当我纵火焚烧时，李封灯光全熄，敌恐慌万状。杨聚和民兵武工队亦于是夜分两路配合××队袭击塔掌，包围伪自卫团，活捉伪团员十四名，缴枪二支，焚毁炮楼一座。十五日夜，一区民兵武工队又掩护群众抢运公粮，连续三夜，为敌发觉，但我民兵早有准备，当敌未来之前，即布雷于高窑河岭上，十六日敌果来袭，当被炸死三人，后敌包围我民兵驻地双泊池，又扑空而返。
