　　Northern Jiangsu-Anhui Line, the Huai River Area
    We Eliminated 2,000 Enemies
    [Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 23rd] The New Fourth Army on the northern Jiangsu-Anhui front has killed or wounded more than 2,000 invading Chiang Kai-shek troops in five days. After the Chiang Kai-shek's Seventh Army invaded northeast of Huaiyin and suffered 1,500 casualties at the hands of the New Fourth Army, its remnants, under the cover of four American-made Chiang Kai-shek planes, fled to Tangji (8 li southwest of Dingjia) on the west bank of Baojia River on the afternoon of the 21st. The New Fourth Army immediately pursued and surrounded them in the narrow area of Tangji and its surrounding Sunzhuang, Wuzhuang, etc., which is two li from east to west and three li from north to south, cutting off their retreat. Another unit of Chiang Kai-shek's 74th Army, attempting to relieve the Seventh Army, launched a two-pronged attack eastward from Huai'an on the 19th, towards Guiheji and Zhuang, more than 30 li south of Lianshui. After three days of encirclement and attack by the New Fourth Army, more than 100 of them have been killed or wounded, and fierce fighting is still ongoing.
