Over 2,500 invading troops from the 54th Division and other units, as well as the puppet county magistrate and regimental commander, and those below, were captured. We seized ten mortars, over a hundred light and heavy machine guns, over 3,700 rifles and short guns, 130,000 rounds of ammunition, and over 200,000 catties of grain. After completing the task of annihilating the enemy, our Eighth Route Army took the initiative to withdraw from Anqiu city.
