　　Important Correction
    In yesterday's edition, on page one, in the article "Celebrating the First Anniversary of General Gao Shuxun's Uprising," in the second paragraph, seventh line, the character "护" (hù, protect) in "护国讨袁" (hù guó tǎo yuán, protect the country and punish Yuan Shikai) was mistakenly printed as "卖" (mài, sell). On page three, in the article "The Historical Status Quo of the Northwest Army," "石友三十三路军" (Shí Yǒu's Thirty-Third Route Army) was mistakenly typeset as "石友卅三路军" (Shí Yǒu's Thirtieth-Third Route Army). On page four, in the "List of Indian Interim Government," "英皇" (Yīng Huáng, British Emperor) was a mistake for "英督" (Yīng Dū, British Governor). We hereby correct these errors.

　　重要更正
    昨日本报一版《祝高树勋将军起义一周年》一文，第二段第七行“护国讨袁”之“护”字误为“卖”字。第三版《西北军的历史现状》一文中，“石友三十三路军”误排为“石友卅三路军”。第四版《印度临时政府名单》中，“英皇”系“英督”之误，特此一并更正。
