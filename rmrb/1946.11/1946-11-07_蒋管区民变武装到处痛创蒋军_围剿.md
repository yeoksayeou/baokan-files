(Comprehensive Xinhua News Agency Report) The people's armed uprisings in the KMT-controlled areas are spreading like wildfire. Although Chiang's troops are constantly carrying out "encirclement" and "pacification" campaigns, they are being met with fierce resistance from the people's forces everywhere. The more they "encircle," the more uprisings there are. In the past month, in Hunan, Yunnan, Sichuan, the border areas of Sichuan, Guizhou, Hunan, and Hubei, and the areas around Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou, Chiang's troops have not only been defeated by the people's forces, but have also had countless weapons seized.
