Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, November 11th: The unemployment problem in the Kuomintang-controlled areas is becoming increasingly serious. In the three cities of Beiping, Tianjin, and Shanghai alone, the number of unemployed exceeds 2.6 million. According to official statistics, Beiping has a population of 1.68 million, with 790,000 unemployed or without occupation, accounting for nearly half of the total population. Nanjing has a population of 800,000, with 200,000 unemployed, an average of one in four people unemployed, not including those without occupation. Shanghai has a population of 3.96 million, with 250,000 unemployed and 1.35 million without occupation, accounting for 40% of the total population. In addition, in Chengdu alone, the number of unemployed cigarette workers and their families reached 100,000. Chongqing also has more than 100,000 unemployed, and Fuzhou has 59,000 unemployed, an average of one in five people unemployed. In the wave of unemployment, countless tragic events are constantly occurring. For example, Li Yuanyuan, an unemployed plasterer in Shanghai, committed suicide by throwing himself into the Huangpu River with his four-year-old child, Lingling, on the evening of August 6th because his wife had a miscarriage and he had no money for medical treatment and could not maintain his livelihood. Another worker, Chen Genfa, could not support his family of four and buried two of his own children alive. Chen Zu@, a professor in the Department of History and Geography at Jinling University in Nanjing, became a vagrant in Shanghai due to unemployment and threw himself into the Huangpu River at 2:00 PM on October 21st. Chen Qin Yu, a graduate of the College of Engineering at Zhejiang University, committed suicide by hanging himself in the Jiaotong University Engineering Building on the night of September 30th because he was unemployed upon graduation. Bishan County in Sichuan has become a human market. In addition to male and female laborers, there are also boys and girls under the age of ten being sold, each priced at only 100,000 yuan.

    平津沪失业
    超过两百万
    【新华社延安十一日电】蒋介石统治区失业问题日趋严重，仅平京沪三城市失业者即达二百六十万人以上。据官方统计，北平人口一百六十八万，失业及无业者达七十九万，几占全人口半数。南京人口八十万，失业者二十万，平均四个人就有一人失业，无业人数还不在内。上海三百九十六万人口中，失业者二十五万，无业者一百三十五万，合占全人口百分之四十。此外成都仅卷烟工人及家属失业者即达十万人，重庆失业者亦在十万人以上，福州失业者五万九千，平均每五个人就有一个失业。在失业浪潮中，无数惨绝人世的悲剧不断发生。如上海失业泥水匠李源源，因妻小产无钱求医，且生活也无法维持，乃抱其四岁幼儿玲玲于八月六日晚同投黄浦江自杀。另一工人陈根法一家四口无法生活，乃将亲生子女两人活活埋死。南京金大史地系教授陈祖＠，因失业流落上海，于十月二十一日下午二时投入黄浦江。浙大工院毕业生陈钦郁，因毕业即失业，九月三十日夜在交大工程馆内自缢身死。四川壁山县城已成为人市场，除男女雇工外，还有十岁以下之男女小孩发卖，每个售价仅十万元。
