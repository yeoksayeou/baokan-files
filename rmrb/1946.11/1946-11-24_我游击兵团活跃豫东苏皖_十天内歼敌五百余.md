Our Guerrilla Corps Active in Eastern Henan and Jiangsu-Anhui Borders
Eliminating Over 500 Enemies in Ten Days
[Our Frontline Reporters Group, 22nd dispatch] Our guerrilla corps, active in the eastern Henan and Jiangsu-Anhui areas, inflicted heavy damage on the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops in early this month, achieving successive victories. In the eastern Henan area: The Xu Xianyan regiment of Zhang Lanfeng's puppet 4th Column attacked our unit stationed at Dailingkou (northwest of Tuocheng). Our army maneuvered and transferred, encountering its 3rd company, which was providing cover for the attack. After a fierce battle of 30 minutes, we completely annihilated it, killing and wounding 16 puppet soldiers, including the puppet company commander, capturing 49 soldiers, seizing 2 light machine guns, 56 rifles, 1 grenade launcher, over 3,000 rounds of ammunition, and over 40 hand grenades. When the Xu puppet troops came to reinforce, our army had already ended the battle and transferred elsewhere. In addition, the puppet troops occupying Anziling north of Huaiyang invaded us, but were repelled. We seized 1 rifle, 1 car, captured 2 puppet soldiers, and 7 special agents, including Chiang Kai-shek's Taikang special affairs officer. Furthermore, the entire puppet township office of Daiji, south of Taikang, was eliminated by us, seizing 65 rifles, over 800 rounds of ammunition, 1 warhorse, 1 telephone, 3 bicycles, and liberating over 200 conscripted men. In the Jiangsu-Anhui area: On the afternoon of the 5th, a large detachment of stubborn puppet traffic police stationed at Baoguanshan within the territory of Dangshan attacked our army on the Yong (cheng) Dang (shan) border. The battle lasted until dusk, with the enemy suffering over 30 casualties. Our army safely withdrew from the battle after completing the task of depleting the enemy. Moreover, our guerrilla forces active on both sides of Xiao (Xiao County, Jiangsu) and Su (Su County, Anhui) annihilated over 200 men of Wang Hongfan's Home Return Corps in Yongcheng territory in five days, and destroyed five illegally organized district offices and 30 township offices, seizing 3 machine guns, 165 rifles, over 3,000 rounds of ammunition, killing and wounding 150 people, and capturing 46 people. According to the above battle results, a total of 400 Chiang Kai-shek puppet soldiers were killed or wounded, 104 were captured, 5 machine guns and 287 rifles were seized, 7,000 rounds of ammunition, 3 bicycles, 1 car, 1 telephone, and many other military supplies and documents.
