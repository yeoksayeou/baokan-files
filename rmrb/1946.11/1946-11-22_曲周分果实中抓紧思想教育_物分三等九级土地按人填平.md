　　Quzhou County has gained some experience in the recent distribution of the fruits of struggle, which is introduced as follows: First, make the masses understand and grasp that this movement is to satisfy the land requirements of poor peasants and poor revolutionary martyrs' families, and also to enable middle peasants participating in the movement to gain benefits. Before the distribution, conduct universal and in-depth education, clear up thinking, and avoid disagreements and disunity during the fruit distribution. Second, distribute quickly to the masses, or distribute readily available items first. If immediate distribution is not possible, have the masses elect a person in charge of safekeeping. In Chengjiabao, the Fourth District, there are four teams in charge of safekeeping: the grain and fodder team, the furniture team, the money and property team, and the land team, to avoid embezzlement and waste of the fruits of struggle by a few activists. In terms of distribution methods, strive for democracy. First, discuss and evaluate in small groups, and then pass it through a general meeting to make the masses feel it is fair and reasonable. If the land recovered by the peasants is large, the land is leveled and supplemented according to the number of people. The distribution of other materials has little disparity, so that the middle peasants participating in the struggle also get benefits. If there is little land but a lot of materials, and poor peasants cannot get enough land, then the distribution of materials has a large disparity, allowing the poor peasants to get more materials, so that they can buy land. Zhizhongzhai in the Second District is where land is leveled according to the number of people, and materials are divided into three classes and nine grades and distributed according to households. Poor revolutionary martyrs' families are first-class, poor peasants are second-class, and middle peasants are third-class (in some cases, poor peasants are first-class, poor-middle peasants are second-class, and middle peasants are third-class). Within each class, further divide into three grades according to the actual living conditions and wealth of the family, and depending on their performance in the struggle and the number of people participating in the struggle. Regarding the house problem, if there are not enough houses to distribute, they are divided according to rooms. Those with homesteads are given houses, and those without homesteads are given homesteads. If poor revolutionary martyrs' families cannot solve housing problems in their villages, the county will solve them. Property is distributed at a discounted price, and the poor are allowed to buy first according to their needs during the auction. Poor peasants who become poor-middle peasants or middle peasants after receiving land are given slightly lower material distribution than poor-middle peasants or middle peasants who have not been allocated land. Secondly, minimize the amount of awards so that the masses can get more fruits. Activists should be elected by the masses and given honorary or partial material rewards. Militiamen, women, and children should be rewarded with a portion of the fruits through the masses, but the amount should not be too large. Zhizhongzhai only rewarded six activists, and each person received no more than one thousand yuan, and each child received less than five hundred yuan. The rewards were also determined based on the amount of fruits in the village. Regarding the handling of mortgaged land, if the land was pawned by the landlord being struggled against to the peasants, if the mortgagee distributes the land, all or part of it will be distributed to the original cultivators; if the land is not distributed, it will be handed over to the Farmers' Association for handling.

　　曲周分果实中抓紧思想教育
    物分三等九级土地按人填平
    【本报讯】曲周县在最近分配斗争果实中获得几点经验，兹介绍如下：首先使群众领会与掌握此次运动是满足贫苦农民及贫苦烈抗军干属的土地要求，而又使参加运动的中农获得利益的方针。在分配前作普遍深入的教育，打通思想，避免在分果实时意见分歧形成不团结现象。其次是迅速分给群众，或先分现成东西，不能马上分配时由群众选出负责人保管。四区公程堡分粮秣股，家具股，钱财股和土地股四股保管，以避免少数积极分子贪污浪费果实。在分配方法上则力求民主，先经小组讨论、评定，然后再经大会通过，使群众认为公平合理。如农民收回的土地多，则土地按人填平补齐，其他物资的分配则悬殊小，使参加斗争的中农亦得到利益；如土地少物资多，贫农分不到足够土地，则物资分配悬殊大，让贫农多分物资，使之能够购买土地。二区致中寨是土地按人填平，物品分三等九级按户分配。贫苦烈抗军干属为头等，贫苦农民为二等，中农为三等（有的是贫农为头等，贫中农为二等，中农为三等），各等里面再按家庭实际生活、财富相比，并视共在斗争中之表现及参加斗争人数等而再各分为三级。房子问题，房子不敷分配时则按间分，有庄基的分房，无庄基者分基，贫苦烈抗军属住房本村不能解决者由县解决。资财折价分配，拍卖时根据需要程度先让穷人买。贫农分得土地后上升为贫中农或中农成分者，分配物资时比未分地的贫中农或中农稍低一些。其次尽量少提奖，使群众多得果实。积极分子应由群众选举，给以名誉或部分物质奖励，民兵、妇女、儿童则通过群众奖给一部分果实，但均不能多提。致中寨只奖励了六个积极分子，每人亦不过千元，儿童每人不到五百元，奖励时并根据本村果实之多少而定。关于活契地的处理，被斗地主出当给农民的地，如承典人分土地时则全部或部分分与原种地，如不分地者则交农会处理。
