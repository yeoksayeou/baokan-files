　　To Coordinate Military Offensives and Submerge Our Liberated Areas
    Jiang Bandit Actively Blocking the Yellow River
    Hebei-Shandong-Henan Provincial Consultative Council Calls on the Nation to Stop This Crime
    [Special Dispatch from our Hebei-Shandong-Henan Correspondent] Director Wang of the Yellow River Commission's Hebei-Shandong-Henan Office, in response to the Kuomintang's violation of the agreement and unilateral blocking of the river mouth, issued the following statement:

    Regarding the Yellow River issue, several months have passed since the Kaifeng Agreement was signed in Shanghai in July. The Kuomintang seems to have forgotten all about it and has not fulfilled it at all. The promised provision of grain, funds, and equipment needed for our projects, as well as relocation fees for residents of the riverbed, have not been allocated to this day. Since Chiang Kai-shek launched a large-scale offensive against our region in August, he has spared no effort in destroying our river works. Our river management materials have been looted by the Chiang army, resulting in enormous losses. In the Caozhou, Cao County, and Dongming areas alone, over 2 million jin of flour, 490,000 jin of hemp rope, 18 barrels of gasoline, 5 barrels of machine oil, 7 barrels of diesel oil, 192,000 flour sacks, 2 million jin of straw, and 70,000 wooden stakes were looted. Furthermore, US-Chiang planes strafed the offices of this commission and the river workers, destroying three of our six jeeps. Due to such serious destruction by the Kuomintang, our projects such as dike restoration, dangerous works consolidation, and straightening the river course cannot be carried out to this day. The Kuomintang, taking advantage of the fact that our projects cannot be carried out and the residents of the riverbed have not been able to evacuate, has intensified the blocking of the river mouth since October, and on October 22, sent Shen, the deputy director of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission, to Garden Mouth to supervise the work in person, ordering its completion within 50 days. It is clear that their intention is to put millions of people in the middle and lower reaches of the river to death. At this point, I tell our people along the river, especially our compatriots in the riverbed, to quickly rise up to defend and save themselves, and quickly move their property outside the dikes. Chiang Kai-shek, this merciless devil, flooded hundreds of thousands of compatriots in Henan by breaching the Garden Mouth in the past, and now he wants to drown us again. We cannot sit idly by and wait for death; we must arm ourselves and resolutely oppose Chiang Kai-shek's unilateral blocking of the river mouth and releasing water to submerge the liberated areas. We demand that all sectors of society across the country, as well as righteous people around the world, help us stop this atrocity of the Jiang bandits. I believe that as long as we all mobilize and work hard, Chiang Kai-shek will definitely have to pay this blood debt.

    [Another Dispatch] The Hebei-Shandong-Henan Provincial Consultative Council, the Yellow River Commission's Hebei-Shandong-Henan Office, and the Hebei-Shandong-Henan District Federation of Workers, Peasants, Youth, and Women, have sent a telegram to righteous people from all walks of life across the country regarding the Jiang side's breach of contract to block the river mouth, appealing as follows in essence:

    Since the three Yellow River agreements, the Jiang side's actions of violating the agreements and breaking their promises have emerged one after another. Now, they have become even more intensified, destroying our projects and intensifying the blocking of the river mouth in violation of the agreement. Our river management materials have been looted; river management agencies and dike repair workers have also been strafed by US-Chiang planes, resulting in heavy losses. As a result, thousands of miles of river dikes in the middle and lower reaches cannot be constructed. Hundreds of thousands of residents in the riverbed have also not been relocated because the Jiang side violated the agreement by not paying relocation fees, not even a single household has been moved. Under these circumstances, the Jiang side is speeding up the blocking of the river mouth, aiming to complete it within 50 days; it is inevitable that they will drown millions of people in the liberated areas. The viciousness of their methods is unprecedented. In addition to calling on the people of our region to rise up in self-defense, this council specially appeals to righteous people from all walks of life across the country and the world to jointly stop Chiang Kai-shek's conspiracy. Force him to implement the agreement, stop the blocking of the river mouth, so that millions of people in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River can be spared from being buried in the bellies of fish. Then the country will be fortunate, and the people will be fortunate. The telegram is urgent, we await your response with utmost anticipation!

　　配合军事进攻阴谋淹我解放区
    蒋贼积极进行黄河堵口
    冀鲁豫参议会呼吁全国制止此种罪行
    【本报冀鲁豫特讯】黄委会冀鲁豫办事处王主任，为国民党违背协议，片面堵口，特发表谈话：
    关于黄河问题，自七月开封协议，在上海签字后，今已历时数月。国民党如同忘记了一样，一点也不履行。所允诺供给我方工程所需之粮款器材，以及河床居民迁移费等，迄不拨付。自八月蒋介石大举进攻我区后，对我河工破坏尤不遗余力。我治河物资，被蒋军抢劫，损失至巨。至曹州曹县东明一带，即被抢去面粉二百余万斤，麻绳四十九万斤、汽油十八桶、机油五桶、柴油七桶、面袋十九万二千条、秸料二百万斤，木桩七万根。且美蒋飞机扫射本会机关及治河工人，我吉普车六辆被毁三辆。因国民党这样严重的破坏，使我复堤、整理险工及裁弯取直等工程，至今不能进行。国民党方面，乘我工程不能进行，河床居民未能退出之际，自十月起，更加紧堵口，并于十月二十二日派黄河水委会副委员长沈某，亲至花园口督工，限令五十天内完成。窥其用心，是欲置我中下游沿河数百万人民于死地，至此，我告诉我沿河人民，尤其是河床内的同胞，快快起来自卫自救，把资财赶快搬到大堤外边。蒋介石这个杀人不眨眼的魔鬼，过去决花园口淹死了河南数十万同胞，今天又想淹死我们。我们不能坐以待毙，要武装起来，坚决的反对蒋介石片面堵口放水，淹没解放区。要求全国各界，以及世界上的正义人士，援助我们，制止将贼这种暴行。我想只要我们大家动员起来干下去，蒋介石这一笔血债是一定要偿还的。
    【又讯】冀鲁豫参议会、黄委会冀鲁豫办事处，及冀鲁豫区工农青妇联合会为蒋方违约堵口事特电全国各界正义人士呼吁，大意如下：
    自黄河三次协议以来，蒋方违反协议，自食诺言之举，层出不穷。今更变本加厉，破坏我方工程，违约加紧堵口。我治河物资横遭抢劫；治河机关及修堤工人，亦横遭美蒋飞机扫射，损失甚重。因之中下游千余里河堤等工程均不能进行。河床内数十万居民，亦因蒋方违约不付迁移费，一户也未迁出。在这种情况下，蒋方加紧堵口，限期五十日完成；势必淹毙解放区数百万人民而后已。其手段之阴毒，实为旷古所未闻。本会除号召我区人民，奋起自卫外，特向全世界全国各界正义人士呼吁，共同制止蒋介石阴谋。迫其执行协议，停止堵口，使黄河中下游数百万人民免葬鱼腹，则国家幸甚、人民幸甚。临电迫切，不胜翘企之至！
