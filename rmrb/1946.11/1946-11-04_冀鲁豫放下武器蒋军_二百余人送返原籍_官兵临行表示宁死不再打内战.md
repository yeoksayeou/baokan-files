　　[Report from our Hebei-Shandong-Henan correspondent on the 1st] Jiang’s army officers, including Wang Boren and Li Shaotang, who laid down their arms in the battles of Longhai Road and Dayang Lake, along with their 75 family members, and 207 soldiers from the 3rd Reorganized Division, including Gu Shaocheng, totaling 283 people, were sent back to their native places in our second batch last month. Before their departure, the military region's training corps held a farewell rally. In addition to returning all their belongings, each person was given travel expenses of 500 border region currency, and each family member was given 1,000 yuan. Zeng Xiuzhen, wife of Li Huansan, deputy battalion commander of the 2nd Battalion of the 3rd Regiment of the Aviation Special Service Brigade, was given 2,000 yuan because she was weak after childbirth, and a cart was hired to escort her. Instructor Cao of the training corps accompanied them for more than two miles, and the Jiang army officers and soldiers were reluctant to leave, tearfully saying goodbye, and unanimously vowed, "From now on, we would rather drown ourselves than fight in the civil war again."
