　　Yangcheng Masses Actively Support the Front Lines
    Militia Tensely Learn Explosives  Over 40,000 People Rush to Transport Military Grain
    [This newspaper, Yangcheng, 30th dispatch] Yangcheng militia are actively practicing martial arts, learning to throw grenades and explosives, and to make stone mines, preparing to set off at any time to smash the invading Chiang troops. Xigou Village in the first district has already made more than 600 stone mines. Wang Baoyuan, the militia squad leader of Dongguan, pointed to the stone mine and said: "This is Chiang Kai-shek's nemesis. We will lay stone minefields everywhere and ambush snipers to let the dog days come in and try it!" Primary school students and staff members of various organizations in various villages have formed more than 30 propaganda teams to go deep into the masses to carry out propaganda, so that the broad masses of people can deeply recognize the true face of the traitor Chiang Kai-shek and his American father. More than 47,000 farmers are transporting grain to the front line day and night. Farmer Zhu Shenglin said: "We cannot go to the front to fight, but we must ensure that our army has sufficient food and grass." In the current affairs discussion, businessman Yuan Qingsheng advocated using local products, not buying or selling foreign goods, and consolidating and developing the liberated area's economy to support the patriotic self-defense war. Women worked day and night to make cotton shoes for the troops, completing 3,700 pairs, which were both good and sturdy. The movement to donate money to buy guns is also continuing in various villages.

    民兵紧张学习爆炸  四万多人赶运军粮
    【本报阳城卅日电】阳城民兵正积极练武，学习投弹爆炸，打石雷，准备随时出发打垮进犯蒋军。一区西沟村已打成石雷六百余颗。东关民兵班长王保园指着石雷说：“这就是蒋介石的死对头，我们要遍地都摆上石雷阵，埋伏下冷枪手，叫狗日的钻进来试一试！”各村的小学生和各机关团体工作人员已组成三十多个宣传队，深入到群众中去宣传，使广大人民深刻认识卖国贼蒋介石和他美国爸爸的真面目。四万七千多农民日夜为前线运粮，农民朱生俪说：“我们不能到前方打仗，总要保证咱们军队的粮草充足。”在时事讨论中，商人原庆生提倡服用土货，不买卖外货，巩固发展解放区经济，以支援爱国自卫战争。妇女们日夜不息给队伍做棉鞋，完成了三千七百双，又好又结实。现各村献金买枪运动亦继续开展中。
