Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 30th: Moscow Dispatch: After 29 years of effort following the October Revolution, the Soviet Union has basically eliminated illiteracy. The social and cultural expenditure for 1950 will reach 106 billion rubles. In the Soviet Union's budget for social and cultural undertakings this year (from July this year to July next year), half is allocated to education, totaling 40.16 billion rubles. This is 13.79 billion rubles more than last year, and 17.6 billion rubles more than before the war. This demonstrates that the Soviet Constitution guarantees the right to education for every Soviet citizen. The Second Five-Year Plan stipulates the implementation of ten-year universal secondary education in cities, and seven-year universal education in rural areas and all national republics. The number of children entering school in 1946-1947 will reach 29,339,000, an increase of 13.9% compared to last year. The German invaders destroyed 82,000 elementary schools, and more than 70,000 schools have been rebuilt by 1946. In terms of higher education, this budget will increase from 2.0191 billion rubles in 1945 to over 4.0059 billion rubles. Higher education institutions suffered significant losses during the war, but they have now returned to normal. There are currently 800 higher education institutions nationwide, with student enrollment increasing by 100,000 compared to pre-war levels. By the end of this year, the number of students in higher education institutions will reach 650,000 or 903,000. The state will also expand the training of various experts in basic sectors of the national economy. The laboratories of higher education institutions will be re-equipped with the latest machinery and other scientific equipment. According to Soviet Minister of Education Kaftanov, in the next semester, educational institutions and schools will pay special attention to the communist education of students, while improving the ideological level of teachers and improving teaching methods. Some revisions have been made to the curriculum. Military training for girls in the 8th, 9th, and 10th grades has been cancelled, with three hours of physical exercise per week. Fourth-year university students will have increased time for studying history, geography, and chemistry. Female students in secondary schools will study teaching methods in their final years.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 30th: Recently, the American magazine "Survey Graphic" published several articles dedicated to discussing the failure of American education. These articles are based on official statistics. It is said that although the United States has been independent for 150 years, illiteracy has not been eliminated. In this war, more than 350,000 American soldiers could not sign their own names. In Louisiana, the illiteracy rate is as high as 36%. Among the 48 states in the United States, 17 states still have racial discrimination (i.e., discrimination against black people), and in these states, the percentage of people who cannot read and write is relatively the highest. More than 20% of students drop out before finishing elementary school, 59% abandon secondary school education, and 90% cannot receive higher education. "Survey Graphic" posed the following question to social celebrities and teachers: What is the main difficulty of the American school system? The answers varied, but one point was consistent: the system does not meet standards and does not meet the needs of life. The head of the Labor Department's Children's Bureau, Lin Luo, advised the American government to learn from the Soviet Union. Stanford University President Tresidder said: Now, whether a person can receive education is determined not by talent but by money. The chairman of the National Farmers Union, Buck, complained that farmers' children do not have adequate opportunities for education, and the situation in farmers' schools in the southern states (where the largest number of black people live) is very poor.

　　十月革命后伟大成就
    苏联文盲绝迹
    美建国百五十年文盲仍多
    【新华社延安三十日电】莫斯科讯：经十月革命后二十九年的努力，苏联已基本上消灭了文盲，而且一九五○年的社会文化经费，将达到一千零六十亿卢布，而苏联本年度（今年七月至明年七月）用于社会文化事业的预算中，一半是作为教育经费的、共四百零一亿六千万卢布，比去年多一百三十七亿九千余万卢布，比战前多一百七十六亿余卢布，这说明了苏联宪法保证每一个苏联公民享有其受教育的权利。第二次五年计划规定在城市实行十年中学的普及教育，在乡村及一切民族共和国内实行七年普及教育。一九四六年至一九四七年入学儿童将达二千九百三十三万九千名，比去年增加百分之十三点九。德寇曾毁坏了八万二千所小学校，一九四六年以前有七万所以上学校已重新修好。在高级教育方面，此项预算将由一九四五年的二十亿一万九千一百万卢布增至四十亿五万九千余万卢布。战时高级教育机关曾遭受重大损失，现在已恢复常态，全国现有高等教育学院八百处，学生名额比战前增加十万人。至今年年底，高级教育机关学生将达六十五万或九十万三千人，国家并将扩大训练国民经济基本部门之各种专家，高级教育机关的试验室将重新装备最新式的机器及其它科学用具。据苏联教育部长卡非特诺夫称：在下学期中，各教育机关、学校将特别注意对学生共产主义的教育，同时提高教员思想水平，改进教学法。在课程方面，已有若干修改。女生在八、九、十年级的军训已取消，每星期有三小时体格锻炼。大学四年级学生增加读史地及化学的时间，中等学校女生在最后数年将习教学法。
    【新华社延安三十日电】最近美国《展望》杂志曾发表若干文章，专门讨论美国教育的失败，这些文章都是根据官方的统计数字。据说虽然美国独立已达一百五十年，但文盲并未消灭，在这次战争中，美军士兵有三十五万以上的人不能签自己的名字。在路易斯安那州，文盲竟有百分之三十六。美国四十八州中，有十七州还有种族歧视（即对黑人的歧视），而在这些州内，不能读和写的人的百分比是比较最大的，没有读完小学免费教育就辍学的学童有百分之二十以上，放弃中等学校教育的有百分之五十九，不能受高等学校教育的有百分之九十。《展望》杂志曾向社会名流和教员提出下一问题：美国学校制度的主要困难是什么？回答是各种各样的，但有一点大家一致，即制度不合标准，并且与生活的需要不相符合。劳工部儿童局长林罗告美国政府向苏联学习，斯坦莱大学校长特莱西德说：现在决定一个人是否能受教育的，不是才能而是金钱。全国农民联盟主席巴柯埋怨说：农民的儿童没有充分机会受教育，而且南部诸洲（按黑人最多）的农民学校，情况非常蹩脚。
