(Our dispatch from Taiyue, 11th) The liberated masses of Jincheng are actively preparing for an all-out resistance. The landmine creation movement has been launched throughout the county. When Chiang's troops invaded northern Henan last month, some people in the newly liberated areas, lacking combat experience, showed signs of panic and fear. Therefore, mass meetings were held in various districts to discuss the current situation and prepare for resistance, which quickly stabilized the people's morale. Thousands upon thousands of people swore never to surrender and to fight Chiang Kai-shek to the end. Since the start of preparations, the nine districts of the county have successively conducted explosives training for groups of 100 to 400 people. Those participating in the training were all militiamen who grew up after liberation. After this training, more than two thousand explosives activists were cultivated and distributed throughout the villages. Currently, every corner of the county is caught up in the explosives training movement, and they have even set up their own explosives factories. In Shenjiang Village, District One, more than 100 households prepared sixteen stone drills for landmine production. Stone craftsman Li Genshuan from Dazhuang Village is determined to make fifty landmines. The militiamen of Huoxiu Village are making one thousand landmines, and the first shift made three in one night. District Seven concentrated all the explosives experts at the mountain passes, preparing stone landmine blockade lines. The landmine making, explosives, saltpeter boiling, and training movements have become a craze throughout the county. Hilltops, mountain slopes, main road junctions, and alleyways have all become training grounds for the militia. From October 22nd to the present, the county has produced 20,000 stone landmines and built × blockade lines, waiting for Chiang's troops to arrive and meet their death.
