　　Military Region Hosts Banquet for Disarmed KMT Officers; Six Generals to Participate in Liberated Area Work
　　[Report from this newspaper] On November 20th, the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region held a banquet to welcome Major General Jiang Guikai, commander of the 9th Engineering Regiment who laid down his weapons in the Ping-Han Campaign, and Major General Guo Rong, commander of the 46th Division, Major General Yang Fenghuai, deputy commander of the 46th Division, Major General Xie Xixuan, deputy commander of the 49th Division, Major General Liu Yuanzhou, chief of staff of the 66th Division, and Major General Hou Dianwei, commander of the artillery regiment, who laid down their weapons in the Shangdang Campaign. After more than a year of study and personal experience, they have a clear understanding of the liberated areas and are willing to dedicate themselves to the people and participate in the work of the liberated areas. During the banquet, Deputy Commander Teng and Deputy Political Commissar Bo raised their glasses to congratulate them, and the atmosphere was lively and cheerful. Major General Hou said: "I am from Zaoqiang, and it will be convenient to work at my doorstep in the future, so I can easily go home." Major General Guo said: "I am behind the times. I used to work with General Sun Dingguo. Liang Huazhi's false progress did deceive many young people." Major General Hou said: "I am from a humble background and have not made any contribution to the country in the past. I hope to learn more in my future work." News came during the banquet that General Liu Bocheng had eliminated 10,000 KMT troops and captured many generals in Hua County. The six major generals said happily and humorously: "Excellent, there must be more of our companions, the more the merrier, so we won't feel lonely." When talking about the defense of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, they all said: "The people of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region have more than ten years of foundation. Hu Zongnan will definitely suffer a great loss and may be completely annihilated." The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves until dusk.

　　军区欢宴放下武器军官六少将参加解放区工作
    【本报讯】十一月二十日，晋冀鲁豫军区设宴欢迎平汉战役放下武器之工兵第九团少将团长蒋桂楷，及上党战役放下武器之四六师少将师长郭溶、少将副师长杨凤槐、四九师少将副师长谢希玄、六六师少将参谋长刘沅洲、少将炮兵团长侯殿威。他们经过一年多的研究学习和亲身生活的体验，对解放区有了清楚的认识，愿意献身给人民，参加解放区工作。席间滕副司令员和薄副政委向他们举杯祝贺，座上谈笑风生。侯少将说：“我是枣强人，以后在家门口做事，回家可方便。”郭少将说：“我落伍了，原先和孙定国将军都是在一起做事的。梁化之的假进步，确实欺骗了不少青年。”侯少将说：“我是个老粗出身，从前对国家没有什么贡献，以后在工作中希望多多学习。”席间传来了刘伯承将军在滑县消灭将军万人的消息，六位少将高兴而幽默地说：“好极了，一定又有咱们的同伴，越来越多，倒不显得孤单。”谈到陕甘宁边区的保卫战，他们齐声说：“陕甘宁边区的人民有了十多年的基础，胡宗南一定要吃大亏，可能全军覆没。”酒至黄昏，宾主尽欢而散。
