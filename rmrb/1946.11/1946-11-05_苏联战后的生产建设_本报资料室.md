　　Post-War Production and Construction in the Soviet Union
    ——From Our Newspaper Archives
    During World War II, the Soviet Union suffered unprecedented destruction and devastation at the hands of Hitler's bandits, bringing endless pain and disaster to the Soviet people, and causing grievous losses to the Soviet Union. However, the victorious Soviet people did not passively lament these losses, but rather strengthened their determination and confidence to heal the wounds of war and further build their socialist motherland. Today, they are reopening and establishing their factories, workshops, farms, apiaries, etc., on ruins and wastelands. With all their creative wisdom and steely determination, they are drawing a magnificent picture—the realization of the new Five-Year Plan.
    Like in the past, the victorious Soviet people have embarked on a broad path of peaceful construction, holding high the banner of socialist competition, and vigorously launching the Stakhanov movement. The general task of the new Five-Year Plan stipulates that the total industrial output should exceed the pre-war level by 48 percent, while the level of heavy industry production should exceed it by 100 percent. Stalin pointed out that in the next fifteen years, the annual output should reach 60 million tons of steel, 50 million tons of pig iron, 500 million tons of coal, and 60 million tons of oil. Although this figure is enormous, based on the Soviet Union's past history and current recovery situation, it can be confidently said that the Soviet Union is fully capable of completing this huge task. The great significance of completing this task, as Stalin said in his "Summary of the Soviet Patriotic War of Victory" last year: "Only under such conditions (completing the new Five-Year Plan) can it be considered that our motherland has a guarantee against unexpected attacks." That is, to make the Soviet Union the strongest and most invincible peace fortress in the world, to safeguard world democracy and peace.
    In terms of the steel industry: Before the war, the Soviet Union had four strong steel industry centers. Except for the Southern center in Ukraine and Crimea, which suffered partial damage from the German invaders, the others maintained constant development of production. Taking the Magnitogorsk area in the Eastern center as an example, the current total steel production has exceeded the pre-war level by more than 35 percent (annual output of 2.47 million tons of steel and 2 million tons of iron). Chelyabinsk's production has exceeded seven times the steel production of any other region in the Soviet Union. In the Southern center, most of the furnace equipment has been repaired. Some areas of Krivoy Rog and Kerch in the region had already exceeded pre-war levels by last year, and Zaporozhye and Makeyevka, which suffered the most losses, will also exceed pre-war levels by the end of this year. Other areas, such as the heavily damaged Stalingrad steel industry, will also reach pre-war levels in 1947. Several huge new steel factories near Leningrad in northwestern Soviet Union have all started construction. The "Red October" steel plant now produces 500,000 tons per year, about three-fifths of its normal output. A new industrial area is being built on the Stavropol Plain in Georgia, with an annual output of 430,000 tons of iron, 500,000 tons of steel, and 380,000 tons of rolled metal. The largest rolled iron factory in Europe, "Azovstal," has reopened and will exceed pre-war output by the end of this year.
    In terms of the coal industry: Soviet coal production is distributed in the Donets Basin, the Tula region in central Russia, the Urals, and the Sverdlovsk region. Of these, the largest, the Donets Basin, had 122 of the 135 large mines that were destroyed repaired by the end of last year, and 136 mines had reached pre-war levels, with 41 exceeding them. The output of the Ural coal-producing area exceeded twice the pre-war level in the past year alone.
    In terms of the oil industry: The Soviet Union's oil production centers are in Grozny in Dagestan, Azerbaijan, Krasnodar, and Sakhalin Island. Except for Krasnodar, which suffered partial damage, the others remain intact and have new equipment. Currently, the oil production industry in the western and southern regions has completed its production plan for the first half of this year ahead of schedule. The main industrial oil production in the Azerbaijan Republic has exceeded three-quarters of this year's plan. The Donets Basin has also exceeded the half-year recovery plan.
    In terms of electricity and machinery manufacturing: These two sectors are currently the fastest-growing sectors in terms of productivity. In the new Five-Year Plan, electricity production will exceed the total electricity production of the twelve years before the war, with an annual output of 82 billion kilowatt-hours. By the end of March, more than 70 percent had recovered to pre-war levels. One of the Soviet Union's largest power plants, Sevastopol and the Karelian power plant, which were completely destroyed by the German invaders, were repaired by the end of last year, and their productivity has exceeded pre-war levels. The Gorky power system is the largest power station in the Soviet Union. The restoration work on the Dnepro power station, one of the largest power stations in the Soviet Union, has been underway for two and a half years, and the sluice gates have now been completely repaired. The world's largest Kirov power plant in Leningrad, with its new boiler generator with 100,000 kilowatts of power, rotating 3,000 times per minute, completed its first half-year production plan. A prominent feature of the new Five-Year Plan is the large-scale use of machinery, and heavy machinery manufacturing is expanding at an unprecedented rate. Soviet heavy industry production exceeded the plan in the first quarter of this year, and exceeded the plan even more in the second quarter, with iron exceeding by 2.6 percent, steel exceeding by 7.3 percent, rolled metal exceeding by 5.4 percent, coke exceeding by 1 percent, and iron pipes exceeding by 2.6 percent. Other partial statistics show that the Leningrad industry has exceeded its production plan by 7.4 percent, Belarusian industrial products have increased by 21 times compared to the spring of 1939, and the industrial output of the Estonian Republic has increased by 77 percent in six months.
    The new industrial sector—the residential building industry—is now widely using electricity to manufacture wood, applying special tractors to transport wood, and applying mechanized vehicles and narrow-gauge railways and other transportation methods to realize the mechanization plan for wood manufacturing and transportation. The German invaders turned six million houses in the Soviet Union into ashes, leaving 25 million people homeless. The new Five-Year Plan is scheduled to build 3.4 million new houses, of which 2.24 million will be built in the former occupied areas. The Soviet authorities are now helping Ukrainian farmers move into new houses from caves and basements as soon as possible. Currently, 400,000 houses have been repaired or rebuilt. Stalingrad, which was heavily bombarded by German artillery and became a pile of rubble several times, is gradually returning to its former appearance. In the next five years, the residential area of ​​Moscow will increase by 3 million square meters.
    In terms of agricultural economy: In order to more rapidly revive and further develop the agricultural economy, it is planned to strengthen the collective economy of collective farms and strengthen machine cultivating stations and state farms organizationally. It is also planned to greatly expand the supply of farming machines, agricultural machinery, and major fertilizers to the agricultural economy. The electrification of collective farms, cultivating stations, and state farms will also be developed on a larger scale. Belarus pays special attention to the development of agriculture. By 1950, the cultivated area will be expanded to 5.3 million hectares. More than 100 power stations have been opened in the Ukrainian countryside, and 80 collective farms and 30 tractor stations have obtained electricity. In the past seven months, 400 power stations have started construction throughout Ukraine, of which 215 are hydropower stations. The construction of 770 power stations will be completed by the end of this year. In order to quickly complete the agricultural plan in the current Five-Year Plan, the North Caucasus has begun to build the Novinomemer River Canal—this is one of the largest irrigation plans in the current Five-Year Plan.
    In terms of animal husbandry: After the German invaders occupied Ukraine, only 6.3 percent of the cattle, 1.9 percent of the pigs, and 4 percent of the sheep of all livestock in 1940 remained in the republic. After the efforts of collective farmers to restore them, the number of cattle this spring has reached 66 percent of the pre-war level, pigs 23 percent, and sheep 29 percent. By 1950, the total number of cattle in the country will not only reach pre-war levels, but also exceed them.
    Railway construction and transportation: In addition to the large-scale revival of the railway network in the disaster area, a total of 7,230 kilometers of new railway lines will be opened to traffic in the next five years. It is planned to invest 40.1 billion rubles in railway transportation. On June 28th of this year, the overall transportation plan for the first half of the year was completed. During this period, coal transportation increased by 21 percent compared to last year, non-ferrous metals by 17 percent, wood by 31 percent, ore sand by 11 percent, cotton by 47 percent, and building materials more than doubled. The victory in transportation will undoubtedly help the increase in national industrial production.
    In terms of water transportation: The new Five-Year Plan is scheduled to expand river freight by 38 percent higher than the pre-war period by 1950, and sea freight by 2.2 times higher than the pre-war period. The work of transforming Hokkaido transportation into a normal navigation trunk line will also continue. The new Five-Year Plan stipulates that the total transport volume of the merchant fleet will increase by more than 100% compared to the pre-war level, and the Black Sea commercial freight will exceed the pre-war level by five times. Recently, the Port of Poki has adopted a large number of new equipment, and at the same time, regular shipping from the Black Sea via the Suez Canal to the Far East has also begun to be established. In the Baltic Sea, its merchant freight volume will increase by 100% compared to 1940 in five years. The White Sea-Baltic Sea Canal (ie, the White Sea Canal, also known as the Stalin Canal), which was destroyed by the German invaders, was opened on July 28th of this year.
    The automobile transportation industry and roads are also being further developed. The total number of domestic automobiles will be expanded to more than double the pre-war level, and air transportation will also be rapidly developed. The construction of automobile factories in the Georgian Republic is developing rapidly. In 1950, it will produce 15,000 automobiles annually. Domestic air routes can be increased tenfold by 1950, reaching 108,789 miles. It is also planned to expand international air routes.
    Radio communications will be developed on the basis of the overall plan for electrical communications. Complete reliable telephone communication organizations between radio communications, Moscow and various republics, local areas, and state centers, as well as between the capitals of the various member republics and their own state centers.
    Regarding the transformation of the national economy after the war: Due to the rapid growth of material production, it can be guaranteed that people's incomes will increase significantly, and it is planned to exceed the pre-war level by 18 percent by 1950. The people's material and living conditions will be greatly improved. Not long ago, due to the surplus of food and consumer products, the Soviet government abolished the voucher shopping system for bread, grains, etc. The prices of goods in business stores have been reduced by 45 percent since July 1. This phenomenon is unique in the post-war world.
    Soviet workers' wages have recently increased once. The living conditions are very comfortable, and they can eat eggs, sausages, pork, chicken, etc. every day. Former tsarist palaces and noble villas have been transformed into sanatoriums for workers, and workers can spend their annual holidays there. The trade union of the famous Kirov Machinery Factory allocated 558,000 rubles this year to ensure that factory workers rest and spend their holidays in sanatoriums, and there are preferential measures for the elderly, weak, disabled, and sick. Not only does everyone in the Soviet Union have work to do and there is no unemployment phenomenon, but also "recruitment" advertisements are posted in newspapers and factory gates everywhere. In the new Five-Year Plan, the industrial, transportation, and construction sectors need 7 million new workers, and collective farms also need millions of workers. The Soviet government is now training a large number of skilled workers. Labor preparatory schools will have 400,000 young skilled workers graduating. By 1950, it is expected to reach 1.2 million.
    Soviet culture and education: It is planned to expand the training of high-level and mid-level specialized talents for the metallurgical industry, fuel industry, and power industry, for agricultural economy, and railway transportation, and to train teachers for primary and secondary schools. The organization of the training of high-level specialized talents in science and technology will also take place.
    The laboratories in higher education institutions will now be equipped with the latest machines and other scientific equipment. In higher education research institutions, 550,000 students have completed their courses this year, and the various experts who have graduated have reached 70,000, more than 50 percent more than last year.
    The victorious Soviet people are now fighting with extremely tense working enthusiasm to complete the new Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule!

　　苏联战后的生产建设
    ——本报资料室
    苏联在第二次世界大战中，遭受了希特勒匪徒们空前的破坏与摧残，给苏联人民带来了无穷的苦痛与灾害，对苏联人民是一种惨重的损失，但胜利的苏联人民不是消极地痛惜于这些损失，而是更增加了他们恢复战后的创伤，并更进一步建设社会主义祖国的毅力与信心。今天，他们正在废墟上荒园里重新开辟与建立他们的工场、作坊、农场、蜂房等等，他们以一切创造的智慧与钢样的坚毅意志绘制着一幅灿烂的图景——实现新五年计划。
    像过去一样，胜利的苏联人民在和平建设的道路上放开了宽阔的步伍，雄健地高举着社会主义竞赛的旗帜，蓬勃的开展了斯塔哈诺夫运动。新五年计划的总任务，规定整个工业生产量要超过战前的百分之四十八，而重工业生产的水平则要超过一倍。斯大林指出在今后十五年中，要达到年产钢六千万吨，铣铁五千万吨，煤炭五万吨，煤油六千万吨。这个数字虽然非常巨大，但根据苏联过去历史与目前恢复情形，可以确信苏联是完全有把握完成这个巨大任务的。这一任务完成的重大意义，正如斯大林在去年“总结苏联胜利爱国战争”中所说：“只有在这种条件（完成新五年计划）下，才可以认为我们的祖国，有了不受意外袭击的保证”。也就是说使苏联成为世界上最强大的不可被战胜的和平堡垒，以保障世界的民主与和平。
    钢铁工业方面：战前苏联有四个强大的钢铁业中心，除了乌克兰与克里米亚的南方中心受到德寇的部分破坏外，其他均保持生产恒常的发展。以东方中心的马格尼托高尔斯克一区来说，目前钢铁生产总量已超过战前的百分之卅五以上（年产钢二百四十七万吨，铁二百万吨）。车里雅宾斯克拉生产已超过苏联任何地区钢生产的七倍以上。在南方中心，熔炉设备大部已告修复，该区的刻里沃罗格与刻赤至去年若干已超过战前水平，在损失最重的萨波罗什与马凯也夫卡也能在今年年底以前超过战前水平。其他如损失惨重的斯大林格勒钢铁业在一九四七年亦将达到战前水平，苏联西北列宁格勒附近各巨大新钢铁工厂均已动工。“红色十月”炼钢厂现在生产率为每年五十万吨，约为平时产量的五分之三。在乔治亚斯塔夫平原上正建设起新的工业区，那里年产铁四十三万吨，钢五十万吨，卷金属卅八万吨。欧洲最大的卷铁厂“亚速夫斯塔尔”工厂已重新开工，至本年底即将超过战前产量。
    煤炭工业方面：苏联煤炭生产分布在顿尼兹盆地，俄罗斯中部图拉地区，乌拉尔，斯维德洛夫斯克区，其中最大的顿尼兹盆地截至去年年底，被破坏的一百三十五座大矿井中，已有一百二十二座修复，一百三十六座矿井已达战前水平，四十一座并已超过。乌拉尔产煤区生产量，仅在去年一年即超过战前二倍。
    煤油工业方面：苏联的煤油生产中心在达吉斯坦之格罗尼斯，阿塞尔拜疆，克拉斯诺达尔，库页岛。除克拉斯诺达尔遭部分破坏外，其他完整如常，并有新的装备。现在西部南部的煤油生产工业均已先期完成今年上半年的生产计划。阿塞尔拜疆共和国之主要工业煤油已超过本年计划四分之三。顿尼斯盆地也已超过半年恢复计划。
    电力与机器制造业方面：这两个部门是目前生产力发展最迅速的部门，电力生产在新五年计划中，将超过战前十二年之总电力，年产八百二十万万基罗瓦特，三月底已有百分之七十以上恢复了战前水平。遭受德寇彻底破坏的苏联最大发电厂之一塞巴斯托波尔和卡累利亚发电厂，去年年底就已修复，而且生产力已超过战前。高尔基电力系统是苏联最大的电力站。苏联最大电力站之一德聂泊电力站的修复工作已进行了二年半，现在水闸已修复完竣。世界最大的列城基洛夫电力厂用十万基罗瓦特电力之新锅形发电机，每分钟旋转三千次，完成了头半年的生产计划。新五年计划的显著特点，是大规模使用机器、重机器制造业正以空前速度扩充着。苏联重工业生产在今年第一季已超过计划，而第二季超过计划要更大，计铁超过百分之二点六，钢超过百分之七点三，卷金属超过百分之五点四，焦炭超过百分之一，铁管超过百分之二点六。其他部分统计如列城工业已超过其生产计划百分之七点四，白俄罗斯工业产品较一九三九年春增加二十一倍，爱沙尼亚共和国六个月中工业产量增加百分之七十七。
    新的工业部门——住宅建筑工业，现正在广泛使用电力制造木材，应用特种曳引机输送木材，和应用机械化汽车和狭轨铁道等等运输方法，实现木材制造与运输的机械化计划。德寇曾使苏联六百万幢房屋化为灰烬，使二千五百万人民无家可归。新五年计划中预定建造三百四十万幢新屋，其中建筑在曾是沦陷区内的有二百二十四万幢。苏联当局现在正帮助乌克兰农民尽速从洞穴地下室移进新的房屋，现在已有四十万幢房屋修复或重建好了。曾遭德寇炮火猛攻几次成为瓦烁堆之斯大林格勒，现已渐复旧观。今后五年内莫斯科城的住宅面积，将增加三百万方公尺。
    农业经济方面：为了更迅速地复兴和更进一步地发展农业经济，预定要增强集体农场的共营经济，和在组织上增强机器耕种机站与国营农场。并预定极度扩大供给耕种机、农业机器、和主要肥料予农业经济。并且将以更广大的规模发展集体农场，耕种机站和国营农场的电气化。白俄罗斯特别注意农业的发展，在一九五○年耕地面积将扩展至五百卅万公顷。乌克兰乡村已开办一百余所电力站，八十个集体农场与三十几个拖拉机站皆获得电力，过去七个月内，全乌克兰有四百所电力场开工，其中有二百一十五所水力站。今年年底将完成七百七十所电力站之建筑。北高加索为了迅速完成本届五年计划中的农业计划，已开始建立诺维诺梅河克运河——这是本届五年计划中最大灌溉计划之一。
    畜牧业方面：德寇侵占乌克兰后，在该共和国仅存一九四○年所有家畜中百分之六点三的牛，百分之一点九的猪，百分之四的羊。经过集体农民的努力恢复后，今春牛的数字已达到战前的百分之六十六，猪为百分之廿三，羊为百分之二十九。至一九五○年时，全国牛的总数，不但要达到战前水平，而且要超过。
    铁路的建筑与运输：除了大规模复兴受灾区铁路网之外，在最近五年中，将有总长七千二百三十公里的新的铁路线通车。铁道运输预定投资四百零一万万卢布。在本年六月二十八日完成了上半年的运输总计划，在此期间，煤的运输比去年增加百分之二十一，非铁金属百分之十七，木材百分之三十一，矿沙百分之十一，棉花百分之四十七，而建筑材料增加一倍以上。运输方面的胜利，无疑将帮助全国工业生产的增涨。
    水运方面：新五年计划预定到一九五○年将河上货运扩大到比战前期高出百分之三十八，海上货运扩大到比战前高出二点二倍，将北海道运输变成为正常航行干线的工作也要继续。新五年计划中规定商船队之总运输量，较战前水平将增加一倍以上，黑海商业货运将超过战前水平五倍。日前波基港大量采用新的装备，同时黑海经苏伊士运河到远东之经常航运也已在开始建立、在波罗的海方面其商船货运量，在五年内将较一九四○年增多一倍。白海通波罗的海运河（即白海运河，亦名斯大林运河）被德寇破坏，已于今年七月二十八日开放。
    汽车运输业和汽车路，也在更进一步发展，国内汽车总数要扩大到比战前加倍，航空运输也要迅速发展。乔治亚共和国的汽车厂建设正在飞跃的发展中，在一九五○年，将年产一万五千辆汽车。国内航空线在一九五○年时，可增加十倍，达十万八千七百八十九英里。并计划扩充国际航空线。
    无线电通讯将在电气通讯总计划的基础上来发展。完成无线电通讯，莫斯科与各共和国各地方与各州中心之间，以及各加盟共和国首都与自己各州中心之间的可靠的电话通讯组织。
    关于战后国民经济的改造：由于物资生产的迅速增长，可以保证人民的收入将大量增加，计划中预定到一九五○年超过战前的百分之十八。人民的物质与生活条件将大大改善。不久以前，因为粮食与消费生产品的盈余，苏联政府取消了面包五谷等的凭证购物制。营业商店的各物价已自七月一日起减低百分之四十五。这种现象在战后世界各国中是绝无仅有的。
    苏联工人工资最近增加一次。生活方面非常优裕，每天能吃到鸡蛋，香肠，猪肉，鸡等。过去沙皇宫殿和贵族别墅都改成了劳动者的休养所，工人们每年假期都可到那里去度过。著名基洛夫机器厂的职工会今年拨五十五万八千卢布，保证工厂工人休息和在休养所度其假日，老弱残废更有优待办法。苏联不但人人有工作做，没有失业现象，而且各地报纸和工厂门口都贴有“招工”广告。在新五年计划中，工业运输建设各部门计需新工人七百万名，各集体农场亦需工人数百万。苏联政府现正在训练大批熟练工人。劳工预备学校将有四十万青年熟练工人毕业。至一九五○年预料可达一百二十万人。
    苏联的文化教育：计划中预定要为冶金工业，燃料工业和动力工业，为农业经济和铁道运输扩大培养高级资格中等资格的专门人才，为小学和中学训练教师人才。并且要在科学与技术方面组织高级资格的专门人才的培养工作。
    在高级教育机关的试验室里，现将装备最新式的机器及其他科学用具，在高级教育研究机关中有五十五万学生完结了他们今年的课程，毕业的各种专家已达七万人，比去年超过百分之五十。
    胜利的苏联人民现正以极度紧张的工作热情，为提早完成新五年计划而斗争！
