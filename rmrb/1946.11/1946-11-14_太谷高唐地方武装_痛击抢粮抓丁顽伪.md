Taigu Gaotang Local Armed Forces
Vigorously Strike Against Stubborn Puppets Who Seize Grain and Enlist Men
[This Dispatch from Changzhi, 12th] In the past half-month, the Taigu local armed forces and militia have striven to strike against the Yan puppet troops' encroachment and grain seizure, achieving successive victories. On the 20th of last month, more than 300 Yan puppet troops invaded our Xishan Di Village and were routed. Their company commander and platoon leader, along with 49 others, were killed or wounded, while we only lost four men, creating a model of small-scale annihilation warfare at a ratio of one to twelve. On the morning of the 22nd, more than 100 Yan puppet troops from the Houcheng stronghold (southeast of Taigu City) again raided our Huian Village to seize grain. Our ×× militia charged into the village and drove them back, killing or wounding a puppet company commander and three others. The village suffered no loss of grain. Since late last month, the Yan puppet troops have been clamoring to occupy Fan Village and Xiaobai, etc., as strongholds for seizing grain, and to control the mountain passes of Fan Village, Huima, and Xianyang, etc., cutting off our traffic between the mountains and the plains to facilitate their encroachment and grain seizure. However, under our active strikes, their small detachments dare not move. They gathered more than 600 troops in Yangyi Town to cover their small detachments' grain-seizing activities on both sides of the Huima River, and constantly invaded our Xiaobai, Huima, Huang Gua and other villages. The local militia has widely laid landmines, and all mountain passes, roads large and small, and areas inside and outside the villages have been blocked. On the 26th, more than 200 Yan puppet troops from Yangyi attacked Xiaobai and Tuhe villages. After being bombed in Tuhe, they fled to Xiaobai and were bombed again, suffering five seriously wounded. They detoured and fled back to Yangyi in a sorry state. (Sijie, Jindian, Shengbiao)
On the 24th, more than 100 Yan puppet troops from Shouyang attacked and occupied our Jinjiaping Village. That night, our Shouyang Independent Battalion fiercely attacked the area and drove them out, killing or wounding ten Yan puppet troops and capturing ten. We only suffered four wounded. After the battle, the local people competed to carry celebratory banners and enthusiastically comforted the troops. (Xiru, Wuding)
[This Dispatch from Weixian, 12th] The stubborn puppets who seize grain and enlist men in Gaotang have been repeatedly struck hard by the local armed forces. On October 16th, the puppet bandit Wu Chunyang's troops invaded Jiatan Village in the Third District to loot and enlist men. Our local armed forces, in coordination with a part of the militia, gave them a head-on blow, and the enemy collapsed and retreated. We captured 49 puppet bandits alive, seized one machine gun, 36 rifles, four pistols, and a quantity of ammunition. On the 25th, more than ten puppet bandits harassed Yuqiao Village in the Third District. After being discovered by the local militia, they bravely pursued them, capturing two men and two guns. The remaining puppet bandits fled in panic. On the 26th, more than 20 puppet bandit regiments attacked the Yanchang area in the Fourth District. After a brave charge by our Fourth District militia, the enemy fled in disarray. After several attacks, the puppet bandit regiment no longer dared to move, and the border areas have become relatively stable.
