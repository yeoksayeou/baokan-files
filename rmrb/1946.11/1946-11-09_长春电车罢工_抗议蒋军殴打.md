Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 5th: Changchun Airmail: Tram workers here held a strike on the 6th of last month. The reason was that when the first tram stopped at a certain station on the morning of the 6th, three soldiers from the "Xiang Tao" troops forced their way onto the tram. When getting off, they also did not obey order. The transportation section chief of the transportation company stepped forward to dissuade them, and was then beaten by the soldiers, who chased him into the company. At the same time, the glass of several other trams was also broken by soldiers, and the conductors were also beaten. Tram workers have been unreasonably beaten by soldiers on many occasions. This time, they could no longer bear it, so they went on strike collectively until the garrison headquarters and the municipal government, pressed by the interruption of transportation, agreed to detain the perpetrators, and the workers then resumed work.

　　长春电车罢工
    抗议蒋军殴打
    【新华社延安五日电】长春航讯：此间电车工人，于上月六日举行罢工，原因为六日上午第一路电车停在中途某站时，有“湘涛”部队兵士三人，强挤上车，下车时也不遵守秩序，交通公司运输科长上前劝阻，遂遭士兵殴击，并追至公司内，同时另有数辆电车，亦被兵士打破玻璃，“车掌”亦被打。电车工人平时历次被军人无理殴打，此次忍无可忍，遂全体罢工，直至警备司令部及市府为交通断绝所迫，允将肇事者拘办，工人始行复工。
