Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 9th: After mobilizing the masses to redistribute land in Shangma River Village, Ning'an County, Mudanjiang Province, the land problem in the village has been thoroughly resolved. Based on the experience of this village, the county work team is conducting a comprehensive review of land reform. During the initial distribution of enemy and puppet land this spring, the land distribution committee was controlled by the local tyrant Yu Wanxi. Good land was retained for the wealthy, while poor and hired peasants received mostly bad or even barren land. A large amount of undeclared land was concealed and controlled by local tyrants and landlords. This unfair phenomenon made poor and hired peasants feel that "those with money and connections always benefit," and that "poor people are destined to be poor." They viewed the land distribution as a "gift" or "ration." Until the redistribution of land began, some people still held the view that "we are willing for the government to allocate some more," and "we will redistribute if the work team decides to, because they are in charge." There were disputes in each village over the issue of land redistribution. Rich peasants, middle peasants, and a few poor peasants who had obtained good land were unwilling to redistribute because they benefitted from it. Therefore, it was explained to some poor peasants that the purpose of redistributing land was not only to get good land but also for the entire poor population to achieve liberation. As for the middle peasants, a considerate approach of "those who do not want to move can stay put" was proposed. As a result, not only did the vast majority of hired and poor peasants demand redistribution, but the middle peasants also sided with the demand for land redistribution. At the village-wide meeting for reasoning and struggle, nine local tyrants led by Yu Wanxi were struggled against, their land was taken back, and hidden land was cleared. After twenty days of discussion, a land distribution method of dividing land into six grades and people into six grades was adopted: "Shorten the long and supplement the short, level the rich and support the poor." As a result of the land distribution, a total of 1,066 *qing* of land were redistributed among 331 households with 1,523 people in the village, averaging seven *mu* of land per person. More than 80% of the peasants expressed satisfaction with this.

    抽肥补瘦重分土地
    隐藏恶霸全被斗垮
    【新华社东北九日电】牡丹江宁安县上马河村发动群众重分土地后，该村土地问题已告彻底解决。该县工作团根据该村经验，正普遍进行土地改革之检查。按该村今春首次分配敌伪土地时，分地委员会为恶霸于万玺所操纵，好地全为富裕者所留下，贫雇农所分者多为坏地，甚至为不毛之地。并有大量黑地隐瞒未报，而操于恶霸地主之手。这种不公平现象，使雇贫农感到“有钱有人总是占便宜”，“穷人命就该穷”，对于分地看作“恩赐”“配给”。直到重新分地开始前，部分群众尚有“政府再配给一下，我们也愿意”，“万事有工作团作主，要重分，我们就重分”等观念。对重分土地问题，各闾发生争论，富农、中农以及少数得到好地的贫农，因得好地，都不愿重分。为此乃教育某些贫农重分地是为了分好地，更是为了整个穷人翻身的道理；对于中农、则提出“不愿动的可不动”的照顾办法。这样不仅绝大多数雇贫农要求重分，中农也站在要求重分土地的一面。在全村分地讲理斗争大大会上，向以于万玺为首的九个恶霸进行了斗争，收回坏蛋土地，清算了黑地。经过二十天讨论，通过了地分六等，人分六等的分地办法，“截长补短，抽肥补瘦”。分地结果，全村三百三十一户一千五百二十三人，共重新分地一千零六十六垧，平均每人得地七亩。百分之八十以上的农民，对此均表满意。
