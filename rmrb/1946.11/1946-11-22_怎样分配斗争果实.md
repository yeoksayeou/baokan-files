How to Distribute the Fruits of Struggle
    Xi Congzhen, Wang Bohua

Whether the distribution of fruits is appropriate or not is a crucial key to determining the further development and deepening of the mass movement. If a village handles it justly and promptly, the movement will advance quickly; conversely, if a village delays distribution or even handles it unfairly, the mass movement will be hindered.

It is natural for the laboring people to participate in the struggle and urgently demand to share the fruits. Delaying distribution, or even some village cadres wasting and embezzling the fruits, is a serious blow to the morale of the masses. Therefore, after each struggle, distributing the fruits quickly and well will raise the morale of the masses, and more people will participate. This has been proven by the facts in many villages.

The distribution of fruits must be reasonable and fair. Reasonable means that the poor peasants should get more, and the middle peasants should also get a share. Fair means that those who participate in the meetings should get more, and poor peasants who do not participate in the meetings should get less. When the masses' level of awareness has not yet been raised, some people always try to distribute in a way that is beneficial to themselves when distributing the fruits for the first time, such as activists wanting to raise their grade, militia wanting bonuses, middle peasants wanting to set the minimum difference, or demanding equal distribution regardless of wealth, hired laborers wanting to be in the top grade, and those with small families wanting to distribute according to the number of people, etc. In short, before distributing the fruits, it is very important to correct the incorrect thinking of some members of the masses (especially a small number of militia, village cadres, and activists). Therefore, it is very necessary to discuss the principles of fair and reasonable fruit distribution in connection with the ideological situation of the masses within the groups. In addition, what is more important is to organize and carefully evaluate the grades and accurately calculate the method of fruit distribution. These are quite complex issues. Therefore, leading cadres should personally participate in the entire process of fruit distribution (especially the first time). This is not taking over, but truly serving the people.

To distribute the fruits well, the masses should be allowed to take control, so as to avoid a few activists taking over and profiting from it, or emphasizing that they should get more. In terms of distribution methods, a evaluation committee should be organized first. After group discussions, impartial people should be elected as evaluation members to plan and carry out the distribution work:

    First step: Make a preliminary estimate of the value of the windfall wealth compensated by the landlords and bullies (in principle, it should be lower than the market price), and submit it to each group for evaluation. Beforehand, the masses should be educated to evaluate seriously, otherwise it will be too late to feel at a disadvantage afterwards. The final price is only determined after making changes based on the opinions of the masses.

    Second step: Evaluate the grades. There are four issues: 1. Divide according to grades. The general standard is based on the average amount of land per person in the whole family. An average of less than one mu per person is considered first grade, less than two mu is considered second grade, and less than three mu is considered third grade. Then, conditions such as whether life is difficult, whether the land is good or bad, whether there is labor, and whether there is sideline production are added, and each grade is further divided into three levels. 2. There should be a distinction between the masses who attend meetings and those who do not. The masses who attend the meetings should get more than those who do not. In order to break the thinking of advanced masses who are "afraid that absorbing more members will reduce their own fruits," the masses, whether they attend meetings or not, should be divided according to grades. However, when the masses who do not attend the meetings also feel that "those who do not attend the meetings still get the same fruits as those who do attend the meetings," which makes the masses who attend the meetings feel wronged and express dissatisfaction, it is necessary to give more to those who attend the meetings, otherwise it will affect the development of mass organizations. 3. Regarding the issue of bonuses for militia, children's corps, and activists, we believe that it is right to insist that they should not get more fruits than the general masses. If some people in the militia, workers, and peasant association activists are indeed found to be particularly hardworking and recognized by the masses, rewards can be proposed through mass discussions, but the amount should not be too much. 4. Special attention should be paid to the poor families of revolutionary martyrs and the poor families of military personnel. Although there are not many such problems in the new areas, attention must also be paid to them, otherwise it will affect the enthusiasm of the masses to join the army. The principle of care is that the poor families of revolutionary martyrs can be raised by one to two grades, and the poor families of military personnel can be raised by one grade. Based on the above principles, combined with the specific conditions of the village, after group discussions, the evaluation committee will evaluate and set the grades for the entire village, and specifically list the names of who is in which grade and level. It is only after the masses have passed the review that it is determined.

    Third step: Calculate how much each person in each grade and level should receive. According to the experience of several villages, it is to fill up to three mu per person. If there is any surplus, then consider distributing windfall wealth. It is best to make the last level (such as the third level in the third grade, the third level is the last level) one share per person, and the second level of the third grade is counted as one share two or one and a half shares. The first level of the third grade is counted as one and a half or two shares per person. By analogy, add up the total number of shares, remove the total number of fruits, accounting for 80% or 70% of the total windfall wealth. The rest is divided equally according to the number of participants, that is, the number that each share should receive.

    Fourth step: The evaluation committee assists the masses in specifically distributing the fruits in person. According to the method of filling up to three mu per person, the land is distributed to the masses, and the windfall wealth outside can also be distributed according to the number of people. If it is difficult to divide according to the number of people, the fruits should be sorted according to their value and quality, and then the masses of the same grade and level should be divided into several groups. According to the number of shares that each group should receive, they are distributed to each group. The masses regroup according to their needs, whether they sell or exchange. However, the fruits of the mass struggle, no matter how big or small, should preferably be completely distributed to the masses and owned privately. Because before the fruits are distributed, any buying and selling relationship is easy to be used by a few people, causing the majority of people to suffer.

After the above four steps, the fruits are distributed quickly and fairly, and the morale of the masses will be higher. At the same time, many problems within the peasant association will also be exposed through this distribution method. It is an important foundation for reorganizing the internal affairs and further carrying out the struggle. In another case, because the masses lack experience in distributing fruits and do not grasp the important links in distributing fruits, they suffer a lot of losses. Distributing fruits along with the struggle can allow the masses to experience these problems in multiple experiences. We should seize this opportunity to conduct education and raise the class consciousness of the masses.

When dealing with fruits, individual cadres and some production agencies always want to find some cheap advantages, buy at low prices at will, or seize the fruits of the mass struggle in the name of lending. This is a concrete manifestation of impure mass consciousness and has a very bad impact on the morale of the masses and us. We suggest that all leading agencies formulate discipline, and before the fruits of the mass struggle are distributed to the masses, no agency, troops, or individuals are allowed to buy or borrow them cheaply. If it is really needed, wait until the fruits are distributed and purchase them from the owner at the market price. In order to prevent this bias from occurring, this should be regarded as one of the important materials for educating cadres.

　　怎样分配斗争果实
    习从真　王伯华
    果实分配适当与否，是决定群众运动进一步发展与深入的重要关键。那个村处理的公正及时，运动就会很快的前进一步，相反的，那个村拖延不分，甚至处理不公，群众运动便会遭到阻碍。
    劳动人民参加斗争，迫切要求分到果实，这本是群众很自然的事。拖延不分，甚至有些村干部，将果实浪费、贪污，这对群众情绪更是个严重打击。因此每次斗争之后，果实分配既快又好，群众情绪就会高，参加的群众就愈多，这点已有好多村庄事实证明了的。
    果实分配要合理，要公平，合理就是贫农要多分，中农也要分。公平就是在会的多分些，不参加会的贫农少分些。当群众觉悟程度尚未提高，初次分果实某些人总是企图用对自己有利的办法来分配，如积极分子要提高一等呀，民兵要提奖呀，中农就想将差额订的最低，或要求不论贫富平均分配，雇工就想分头等，人口少的就想按参加的人头来分等等，总之在分配果实前，如何纠正群众中的某些分子（特别是少数民兵、村干、积极分子）不正确的思想是很重要的事。因此将分果实公平合理的原则并联系群众中的思想情况，在小组内展开讨论是非常必要的。另外，更重要的即是很好组织与慎重的评议等级与精确计算果实的分法，这些都是相当复杂的问题。因此领导干部应亲自动手参加分配果实的整个过程（特别是第一次），这不是包办，而是真正为人民服务。
    果实要分配好，应让群众掌握，以免少数积极分子包办从中取利，或强调自己要多分。在分配的办法上，首先要组织评议委员会，由小组讨论，选举公正人充为评议委员，计划进行分配工作：
    第一步、将被斗地主恶霸赔偿的浮财，初步的估价（原则上要比市价低些），交各小组评议，事前应教育群众认真的评议，不然事后感到吃亏就晚了。根据群众讨论意见，再加以更改，才算是最后的价格。
    第二步、评议等级，其中有四个问题：一、按等级分，一般的标准，是以全家每口人平均多少地为主。每人平均一亩以下算一等、二亩以下算二等，三亩以下算三等。再加以生活是否困难、土地好坏、有无劳动力、有无副业生产等条件，每等再分三级。二、在会与不在会的群众要有区别，在会的群众要比不在会的多分一些。为打破先进群众“怕多吸收会员自己少得果实”的思想，无论在会与不在会的群众一样按等级分。但当不在会的群众也发生一种“不在会的还不是和在会的一样分果实”而使在会的群众感觉冤，表示不满的情绪时，在会的多分一些也是必要的，不然也会影响群众组织的发展。三、关于民兵、儿童团、和积极分子提奖问题，我们认为坚持他们不能比一般群众多分果实的意见是对的。如民兵、工人和农会积极分子中，确乎发现某些人特别劳苦而为群众公认，可经群众讨论提出奖励，但数目不宜过多。四、特别照顾贫苦烈抗属及贫苦的军属问题，在新区虽然这类问题不多，但也必须注意，不然对群众热烈参军会有影响。照顾的原则，贫苦的烈抗属，可提高一级至两级，贫苦军属，加一级。根据以上原则联系到本村具体情况，经小组讨论，再经评议委员会评订全村的等级，并具体开出谁是那一等那一级的名单，再经群众通过审查，才算确定。
    第三步、计算何等何级，每人应该分多少，根据几个村的经验，是按每人三亩以下填平。有余剩再酌量分浮财，最好把最后的一级（如按三等九级说三等中的第三级是最末一级）每人作一股，三等二级就算一股二或一股半。三等一级，每人算一股半或两股。以此类推，这样再将全体的股数加起来，去除果实的总数，占全部浮财的百分之八十或七十。其余按参加人数平分，即每股应分的数目。
    第四步、评议委员协同群众当面具体分配果实。根据三亩以下填平的办法将土地分给群众，以外的浮财，亦可按人分。有的按人分困难，应按果实贵贱好坏拚开，再把群众同等同级分成若干组，按各组应分数目，分到各组里，群众根据需要与否，或卖或交换由小组再拚对。但群众斗争果实，不论大小，最好完全分给群众归私人所有。因果实未分以前经过买卖关系，是容易被少数人利用，使多数人吃亏。
    经过以上四个步骤，果实分得迅速与公正，群众情绪就更会高涨起来。同时经过这样分法亦会暴露农会内部很多问题，不论对整理内部与再进一步的进行斗争，都是很重要的基础。在另外一种情况下，由于群众分果实缺乏经验，不会掌握分果实重要关节，吃了不少的大亏，随斗随分，可以使群众在多次经验中来体会这些问题。我们应抓紧这个机会，进行教育，提高群众阶级觉悟。
    在处理果实时，有个别干部与某些生产机关总想找点便宜，随便拿贱价买、或借名义夺取群众斗争果实，这是群众观念不纯的具体表现，对群众情绪及我们的影响极坏，我们建议各领导机关制定纪律，凡群众斗争的果实在群众未分前，不论机关部队和个人，一概不准贱买或借用。如确实需要，待果实分配后，以市价向物主购买。为防止这种偏向产生，应把此当作教育干部重要材料之一。
