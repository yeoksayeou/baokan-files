Liberation Daily Editorial, November 11

Chiang Kai-shek's statement on November 8, despite being adorned with the usual "peace" rhetoric, is recognized by those who pay attention to facts rather than words as the most reckless and vehement declaration of war. Chiang Kai-shek has decided to completely sever the path of unity and democracy that has been paved by the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) over the past year. By summoning a group of so-called "National Assembly Representatives" who emerged mysteriously ten years ago and have long been notorious, to convene his so-called "National Assembly," he is not only declaring war on the Chinese Communist Party but also on all third-party democratic factions, non-affiliated democratic individuals, and the entire Chinese people. Of course, the so-called "National Assembly," which he orchestrated single-handedly, holds no political significance today. It's merely a worn-out straw sandal from Chiang Kai-shek's political magic box, and no one believes it represents "popular will." What's important is that Chiang Kai-shek wants to use this broken straw sandal to pass a so-called "Constitution," to "legitimize" his dictatorship, to "legitimize" his civil war, and to "legitimize" his betrayal of the country. In short, he wants to use this to usurp the state and give his usurpation a so-called "constitutional" basis. In doing so, he buries the last hope of political compromise and provides a simple and clear final conclusion to the year-long dispute. Chiang Kai-shek is determined to pursue long-term division, long-term civil war, long-term dictatorship, and long-term betrayal of the country (as a liberal newspaper in Shanghai stated, Chiang Kai-shek signed an unprecedented treaty of national betrayal with the United States on the eve of this statement, which is no coincidence). Therefore, he would rather fall into extreme illegality, extreme betrayal of trust, and extreme isolation than not convene this so-called "National Assembly." It is clear that today's so-called "National Assembly" issue is a matter of life and death for the entire nation. The people will never recognize this so-called "National Assembly" or any so-called "Constitution" it fabricates, and they must fight to the end against this so-called "National Assembly" and its fabricated "Constitution."

Since Chiang Kai-shek has issued this declaration of war, no matter how patiently the CCP and democratic parties seek compromise, it will be impossible. Similarly, since Chiang Kai-shek has issued this declaration of war, it will be difficult for him to evoke any illusions of peace, even if he issues ten thousand "cease-fire orders." Facts have proven that every promise and cease-fire order from Chiang Kai-shek is hypocritical, and this "cease-fire order," issued simultaneously with his declaration of war, is the most hypocritical of all. It is like cutting off a person's head and then applying a plaster to their neck. Chiang Kai-shek has finally killed the last thread of hope since the PCC.

Chiang Kai-shek is now so-called "armed to the teeth." He has turned his ruling area into a large military camp, and almost every provincial chairman is or has been replaced by a warlord. Even cities like Beiping are openly conscripting soldiers, and even the most famine-stricken provinces are extorting military rations. Military expenditure accounts for more than 80% of the total fiscal expenditure. Therefore, the people across the country are well aware of what Chiang Kai-shek intends to do. In fact, Chiang Kai-shek is continuing his offensive in various places and is even actively preparing to attack Yan'an, which he does not even conceal in his statement. However, according to his terminology, this is called: "Except for what is necessary to defend the current location (which should be read as except for what is necessary for my offensive plan), cease other military actions." Or: "In military terms, any political party must not possess an army, and any army should be an army of the state (which should be read as, in military terms, any patriotic army and people's army must be eliminated, and any army should be an army of the traitorous party and the dictatorial party)." Under these circumstances, the Chinese Communist Party, which has consistently demanded peace, could not but expose this deception in its statement on November 9, which would naturally be approved by all fair observers.

Two statements: one is hypocritical, and the other is frank; one is destructive, and the other is constructive. Although Chiang Kai-shek has closed the door to compromise by convening the so-called "National Assembly," the CCP still demands that Chiang Kai-shek stop his so-called "National Assembly" and withdraw his attacking troops, which is clearly the only and final constructive way out of China's current crisis. The CCP's statement is imbued with a solemn position and filled with firm conviction, indicating that all of Chiang Kai-shek's attacks, threats, and deceptions are now ineffective in the face of an unwavering opponent. Chiang Kai-shek, this utterly selfish autocrat, emboldened by the armed support of American imperialism, and recklessly convening the so-called "National Assembly," will probably not accept the CCP's final advice. But in doing so, he will make a huge mistake. His ridiculous reason for abandoning the PCC is: "The general situation has greatly changed in the past six months," as if the PCC and all agreements and promises should have been short-lived. However, this statement also contains a certain amount of truth, namely that the general situation has indeed changed significantly in three or four months. Chiang Kai-shek has not only rapidly lost popular support politically, but also rapidly lost thirty-five brigades of troops militarily. Chiang Kai-shek's current consumption of his military strength, financial resources, and manpower is more intense and severe than at any time in his entire rule. All indications suggest that this consumption cannot be sustained for long. His daring to convene the so-called "National Assembly" now shows that his strength, like his arrogance, has reached its peak. If he continues to reject the CCP's advice, then the general situation will continue to change greatly, and he will soon taste the bitterness of "it is easy to climb the mountain, but difficult to descend." The whole world understands that this is no one else's fault; it is entirely the result of Chiang Kai-shek's own misdeeds and his own riding the tiger's back.

### 两个声明

    两个声明
    解放日报十一日社论
    蒋介石十一月八日的声明，尽管照例装璜了一些“和平”的字眼，但是注意事实而不注意字眼的人，都知道他是发表了一篇最卤莽最激烈的宣战书。蒋介石决定把一年来由政协铺成的团结民主的轨道完全割断，把十年前莫名其妙地跑出来的早已臭名彰著的一批所谓“国大代表”召集起来开他的所谓“国大”，这样他就不但向中国共产党宣了战，而且向一切第三方面的民主党派和无党派的民主人士宣了战，向全体中国人民宣了战。当然他一手包办的所谓“国大”本身，在今天一点政治重要性也没有，这不过是蒋介石政治魔术箱里的一只用烂了的破草鞋，谁也不会认为它代表什么“民意”，重要的是蒋介石要利用这个破草鞋通过一个所谓“宪法”，把他的独裁“合法”化，把他的内战“合法”化，把他的卖国合法化，总之是他要借此篡夺国家，并使他的篡夺得到所谓“宪法”的根据。正是这样，他就埋葬了政治妥协的最后希望，并且替一年来的争论做了简单明了的最后结论。蒋介石一定要长期分裂，一定要长期内战，一定要长期独裁，一定要长期卖国“如同上海的自由主义报纸所说，正在这次声明的前夜，蒋介石签订了空前丧权辱国的中美商约，这决不是偶然的）。因此，他宁可陷于极端的非法、极端的背信、极端的孤立，却非召集这个所谓“国大”不可。可见今天的所谓“国大”问题，乃是全国人民生死攸关的问题，人民决不能承认这个所谓“国大”及其伪造的任何所谓“宪法”，而且一定要为反对这个所谓“国大”及其伪造“宪法”而奋斗到底。
    蒋介石既然发出了这个宣战书，中共和民主党派无论怎样忍耐地寻求妥协也是不可能了。同样蒋介石既然发出这个宣战书，他再发表一万个“停战令”也很难引起和平的幻想了。事实已经证明，蒋介石每一次的诺言和停战令，都是虚伪的，而这一次与他的宣战书同时发出的“停战令”，则是其最虚伪者。好比杀了一个人的头，却在那人的颈项上贴一张膏药，蒋介石已将政协会议以来的一线希望都最后杀死了。
    蒋介石现在正是所谓“武装到牙齿”了。他已经把他的统治区变做一个大兵营，差不多每个省主席都是或都换成了军阀。连北平这样的城市，都公然拉壮丁，连最饥荒的省份，都在勒索军粮，军费支出达全部财政支出百分之八十以上。因此，蒋介石要干什么，全国老百姓心里是雪亮的。事实上蒋介石还在各地继续进攻，甚至正在积极准备进攻延安，甚至在他的声明中，也不隐讳这一点。不过按照他的术语，这叫做：“除为防守现地所必须者外（应该读做除余之进攻计划中所必须者外），停止其他军事行动”。或者是“在军事上必须使任何政党皆不能拥有军队，而任何军队均应为国家之军队（应该读做在军事上必须消灭任何爱国军队与人民军队，而任何军队均应为卖国政党、独裁政党之军队）”。在这种情形下面，一贯要求和平的中国共产党，在十一月九日的声明中坦白地揭穿这个欺骗，自然不能不令一切公平的观察家首肯。
    两个声明：一个是虚伪的，一个是坦白的；一个是破坏的，一个是建设的。虽然蒋介石以召开所谓“国大”，关闭了妥协之门，中共仍然要求蒋介石停开他的所谓“国大”，并撤回他的进攻军队，这显然是今天中国危局的唯一和最后的建设性的出路。中共的声明，贯彻着严正的立场，充满着坚定的信念，这表示蒋介石的一切进攻、威吓和欺诈，现在是在一个毫不动摇的对手面前无所施其技了。蒋介石这个一毛不拔的大独裁者，既因美帝国主义的武装支持而冲昏头脑，而冒险召开所谓“国大”，那么他大概不会接受中共的最后忠告。但是这样，他就犯了绝大的错误。他抛弃政协的滑稽理由是：“此半年间，一般情势已大有变迁”，好像政协和一切协议一切诺言，本来都应该朝生暮死。不过这句话也有一面的真理，即在三四个月间一般情势即已大有变迁。蒋介石不但在政治上已经迅速失尽人心，而且在军事上也已经迅速失掉三十五个旅的兵力。蒋介石现在消耗他的兵力财力人力之紧张与激烈，在他全部统治历史上是空前的。一切迹象都表明这种消耗决不能维持多久，现在他敢于冒险召开所谓“国大”，表示他的力量犹如他的狂妄已经达到顶点，如果他仍然拒绝中共的忠告，那么一般情势既将继续大有变迁，他不久就必然要尝到所谓“上山容易下山难”的苦味。全世界都看得明白，这不怪任何别人，这完全是蒋介石自己作孽，自己骑上虎背的结果。
