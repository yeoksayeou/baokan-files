Two Roads to Factory Management
Changzhi City's Factory Management Experience
Labor-Capital Cooperation: Benefits for Both Sides
Simple Employment: Easy to Lose Money

    During the enemy occupation, Changzhi City had only nine factories, including electric lights, flour, tap water, and textiles, all managed by factory owners. After liberation, with the active support of our democratic government, industry developed rapidly. By the end of March this year, the city's factories had increased from nine to twenty-eight. After the "May Day" celebration, due to the launch of the New Laborer Movement, workers' enthusiasm for production increased, and factory owners made significant profits. As a result, factories proliferated. Currently, the city has a total of forty-one factories, large and small, an increase of nearly one-third compared to April. Among these forty-one factories, there are sixteen textile factories, two flour mills, eleven cigarette factories, two printing factories, and one each for electric lights, chemicals, saltpeter, oilcloth, leather, porcelain, tools, paper, tap water, and explosives.

    Over the past few months, most factories have made considerable profits. However, some factories, due to significant problems in their management methods, have not only failed to profit but have also lost money. Three textile factories even suspended operations entirely due to excessive losses. To identify the root causes of these factories' losses and improve future factory management methods to further develop Changzhi's industry, the city convened a meeting of factory managers and worker representatives. Through in-depth reviews by both labor and management, the reasons for this phenomenon were identified as stemming from two extremely different approaches to factory management.

    First, regarding labor-capital relations: it is necessary to implement the principle of labor-capital cooperation and mutual benefit, ensuring that workers' lives continue to improve, while factories can simultaneously make profits. When the Changzhi Explosives Factory launched the New Laborer Movement in early April, it simultaneously replaced the manager, absorbed worker representatives into the management committee, increased workers' wages from 1,200 yuan to 2,000 yuan, and provided all waste coal slag and scrap wood to workers' families for fuel. They also made spinning wheels for them and distributed old cotton at the original price of 150 yuan (half the market price), organizing them for production. This solved the entire livelihood problem of the workers. When the trade union proposed completing three months' worth of tasks in two months in May, the factory immediately and voluntarily doubled the workers' food allowance, increasing it from 300 yuan to 600 yuan. It also proposed that if workers could complete the plan on schedule, in addition to receiving three months' wages, each person would receive a pair of leather-soled shoes as a reward, and special model workers would receive additional rewards such as towels and socks. As a result, worker morale was exceptionally high, and productivity greatly increased. Workers voluntarily skipped holidays and lunch naps. Consequently, output increased significantly, quality improved, and raw material consumption decreased. Within two months, they completed 100% of the three-month production plan. The workers received three months' wages and rewards, while the factory also earned double the profit compared to previous months. Conversely, at the Taiheng Textile Factory, the highest wage for workers was only nine dou of rice, and the lowest was just over three dou. Apprentices earned less in a month than they consumed. The flour mill affiliated with the tap water company did not implement profit-sharing and incentive measures. Workers were not given bonuses for increased flour production, and workers were arbitrarily dismissed, with the manager and accountant's personal connections being used. As a result, worker morale was very low, and no one wanted to continue working, production decreased, and the factory lost a lot of money.

    Second, in terms of management methods, only by implementing democratic management methods, absorbing workers into the administrative management committee, and making each worker feel like a master can workers' enthusiasm be unleashed and production increased. The Huaqiang Textile Factory was originally preparing to cease operations due to unprofitability. However, after a general meeting was held to discuss and decide to implement public-private joint management (public funds as shares, workers' labor as shares), and workers were absorbed into factory management, worker Wang Haocheng was elected as the trade union director and was responsible for buying and selling raw materials and cloth. Trade union propaganda members Ren Tiancheng and Wang Zhiying, in addition to weaving, also served as engineering administrators. Cook Li Youlan was elected as the accountant, and apprentice Guo Chengbin managed cash disbursement. After this, the workers deeply understood that the factory belonged to the workers themselves, and they had a share in both profits and losses. Thus, production enthusiasm was unprecedentedly high, and output increased significantly. In the past, it took two days to produce a bolt of cloth; now, one bolt can be woven in a day with ease. At the same time, they also held a review meeting every seven days to commend the workers' strengths and propose future improvements. If workers had problems, they would first talk to them individually to help them understand, and then ask them to consciously offer self-criticism at the meeting. This kept the workers' morale consistently high. As a result, when accounts were settled at the end of the lunar July, the highest wage for workers reached 6,700 yuan, and the factory also made substantial profits. However, the Taiheng Textile Factory adopted military management in its management: after workers started work, they were not allowed to see any visitors or family members until after work; they were only allowed fifteen days of leave per year, and they had to take turns and return on time; whoever made a mistake would be criticized; whoever missed work for a meeting would be fired; if workers actively participated in trade union activities, the factory would say they had political problems to suppress them; apprentices were not allowed to go out on the street freely; and they often threatened workers with the saying, "Whoever is bad will be transferred to the front lines." As a result, the workers became despondent and adopted a perfunctory attitude towards production. Production volume was extremely low, and the factory was, of course, going to lose money.

    Third, in terms of organizational structure, it is essential to reduce the number of non-productive personnel, eliminate the bureaucratic style of factories, and reduce expenses in order to increase factory revenue. Before June, the Xinhua Paper Mill lost money every month. After rectification in mid-June, the entire factory had seventeen workers, three apprentices, and one cook, with only one employee who was not directly involved in production, reducing factory expenses by half compared to before. Conversely, at the chemical factory, the entire factory had only seventeen workers, but it was equipped with ten cadres. Their positions were: one manager, one salesperson, one custodian, one accountant, one engineer, one instructor, one purchaser, one clerk, and two researchers. Not only did they eat without producing, but their wages were also much higher than the workers', with the highest being 10,300 yuan and the lowest being 9,300 yuan, 600 yuan more than the workers' highest wage of 8,700 yuan. As a result, the workers said these cadres were "lazy monks who don't chant scriptures." Therefore, the factory, which was originally very profitable, ended up not making money, even losing money.

    Currently, the factories in Changzhi City are improving their management methods based on these experiences. These experiences also have the same improvement value for factories in other regions. (Compiled by this newspaper's research office)

    经营工厂的两条道路
    长治市工厂管理经验
    劳资合作劳资两利
    单纯雇佣容易赔钱
    长治市在敌人统治时期，全城只有电灯、面粉、自来水、纺织等九家工厂，统由厂人经管。解放后，在我民主政府的积极扶助下，工业日益发展，到今年三月底统计，全市工厂已由九家增至二十八家。“五一”以后，由于开展了新劳动者运动，工人生产情绪提高，厂方大大赚钱。因之，工厂激增。现在，全市已共有大小工厂四十一家，比四月份增加了将近三分之一。这四十一个工厂中，共有纺织厂十六个，面粉厂两座，卷烟厂十一家，印刷厂两处，其他电灯、化学、硝业、油布、皮革、磁器、工具、造纸、自来水、炸弹等厂各一。
    几个月来，大多数的工厂都大大的赚了钱，可是，一些工厂由于经营方法上存在着不少的毛病，不仅无利可赚，还赔了钱，有三家纺织厂因赔钱太多，甚至全部停工了。为了找出这些工厂赔钱的根本原因，改善今后工厂的经营方法，来更进一步发展长治的工业，本市曾召开了全市各工厂经理及工人代表会议。经过劳资双方深刻的检讨，找出所以发生这种现象的原因，是因为在工厂的经营方法上有着两种极不相同的办法。
    首先，在劳资关系方面：必须实行劳资合作、劳资两利的方针，使工人生活继续提高与改善，工厂同时才能有利可赚。长治炸弹所在四月初开展新劳动者运动时，同时改换了经理，吸收工人代表参加管理委员会，将工人的工资由一千二百元增至两千元；并将工厂的废炭渣及废木料全部送给工人家属烧火，还给他们做了纺车，把旧存棉花按原价一百五十元（比市价低一半）发给他们，组织他们生产；这样解决了工人整个生活问题。当五月里工会提出两个月完成三个月的任务时，厂方马上便自动把工人的菜金提高一倍，由三百元增至六百元；并提出工人如能按期完成计划，除照发三个月的工资外，每人还奖一双皮底鞋，特殊模范者还另给毛巾、袜子等奖品。因此，工人情绪异常高涨，生产力大大提高，工人们自动不过礼拜、不午睡。结果，产量大增，质量提高，原料消耗减少，于两个月内百分之百的完成了三个月生产计划。工人们领到了三个月的工资和奖品，而工厂也获得比以前每月加倍的利息。反之，如泰恒纺织厂，工人最高工资才九斗米，最低的只有三斗多，学徒们一个月赚的还不够消费。自来水公司附属的面粉厂，不实行分红奖励办法，工人多生产的面粉不分红，并且还任意解雇工人，并引用经理、会计的私人。这样，工人情绪很低，都不愿再干下去，生产量减少，工厂大大赔了钱。
    其次，在管理方法上，只有实行民主的管理方法，吸收工人参加行政管理委员会，使每个工人有主人翁的感觉，才能发挥工人的积极性，增加生产。华强纺织厂本来因不赚钱，厂方准备停工不干了，但经召开全体会议讨论，决定实行公私合营（公家钱股工人算劳力股）；并吸收工人参加工厂管理，选出工人王好成为工会主任兼对外买卖原料布匹，工会组织宣传委员任天成、王之英除织布外并兼任工务管理员，炊事员李友兰当选会计，络线学徒郭成斌管理现金出纳以后，工人都深刻明白工厂是工人自己的，赔赚都有自己一份。于是，生产情绪空前高涨，产量大增，过去两天不下一个布，现一天织一个还很消停。同时，他们七天还开一次检讨会，在会上表扬工人的优点，和提出今后改进的办法。工人们有了毛病，先和他个别谈话，让他自己想通了，叫他自觉的在会上提出自我批评，这样使工人的情绪一直巩固下来。结果，旧历七月底结账时，工人最高工资分到六千七百元，工厂也获得大批的利润。而泰恒纺织厂，在管理上采用军事管理：工人上工后，不管什么客人家属都不准见，必须等到下工以后；一年只能请十五天假，还得轮流回去，按时来；谁有了错，谁挨批评；谁开会误了工，开除谁；工人参加工会活动谁积极，厂方便说谁有政治问题来压制；学徒不能自由上街；并常用谁坏调谁到前方去的说法来威胁。于是，闹得工人死气沉沉，对生产抱着应付的态度，生产量大低而特低，厂方当然要赔钱了。
    再次，在组织机构上，一定要减少不生产的人员，取消工厂机关化的作风，减少开支，才能增多工厂的收入。新华纸厂六月以前，厂方月月赔钱，六月中旬整顿以后，全厂十七个工人、三个学徒，一个伙夫，只有一个脱离生产的职员，使工厂开支较前减少一半。反之，如化学工厂，全厂只十七个工人，就配备了十个干部，他们的职务是：经理一人，营业员一人，保管员一人，会计一人，工务员一人，指导员一人，采购员一人，事务员一人，研究室二人。他们不仅光吃不生产，工资又较工人高得多，最高者一万零三百元，最低的也有九千三百元，比工人最高工资八千七百元还多六百元。工人们因此说这些干部是“死吃和尚不念经”。所以，工厂本来很赚钱，结果却弄得不赚钱，甚至赔本了。
    现在，长治市的各工厂正在根据着这些经验来改进它们的经营方法。而这些经验对于其他各地的工厂，也有它同样的改进作用。（本报研究室整理）
