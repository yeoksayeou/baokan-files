Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th. According to the Central News Agency: On the 12th, Jiang's government ambassador to the United States, Gu Weijun, delivered a speech at the National Foreign Trade Convention in New York, stating: "The Sino-US Commercial Treaty has an important factor in the development of trade in China by the United States, namely, the opening of all Chinese territory to American merchants." He also stated: "There are American people who cannot compete with Chinese exporters, such as bristles, manganese ore, tin ore, silk, and tea, as well as non-American products such as embroidery, lace, and linen fabrics, which have high manufacturing value and are time-consuming, and even the United States cannot produce them; however, on the other hand, American steel, wood, wheat, flour, cotton fabrics, etc., cannot be resisted by Chinese production." Xinhua News Agency reporter's note: To open up Chinese territory to American imperialism, this explanation of the Sino-US Commercial Treaty is very true, thus nakedly exposing the face of the Chinese traitorous and treacherous government. But if this is the case, the most important industrial and agricultural production in China, such as steel, wood, wheat, flour, and cotton, cannot compete with the United States. In other words, these Chinese productions will go bankrupt. I don't know where the Chiang Kai-shek government will place China's national economy, people's livelihood, and the fate of the entire Chinese nation.

　　好一副汉奸嘴脸！
    顾维钧解释“中美商约”妄称全国领土对美开放
    【新华社延安十六日电】据中央社：十二日蒋政府驻美大使顾维钧，在纽约美全国对外贸易会议上发表演说，内称：“中美商约中具有美国发展在华贸易的重要因素，即全中国领土均向美国商人开放是也。”又称：“美国人民有未能与中国出口商竞争者，如猪鬃、锰矿、锡矿、蚕丝及茶叶与非美国出产品之刺绣、花边及麻织物，制造价值甚高。且费时，虽美国亦无法出产；然在另一方面，美国之钢铁、木材、小麦、面粉、棉织物等，即非中国生产所能撷抗。”新华社记者按：拿上中国领土向美国帝国主义开放，这个对中美商约的解释是很真实的，因此赤裸裸地暴露了中国卖国贼汉奸政府的嘴脸。但既然这样，开放的结果中国的钢铁、木材、小麦、面粉、棉织等项最主要的工农生产，均不能与美国相撷抗。也就是说，中国的这些生产均要总破产。不知道蒋介石政府，将置中国的国计民生与整个中国民族命运于何地。
