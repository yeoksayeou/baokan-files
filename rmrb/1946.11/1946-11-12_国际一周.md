International Week

The U.S. election, which has drawn attention from all parties, has come to an end, and this is one of the major international events of the week. In this election, the Republican Party has won, taking control of both the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Democratic Party has suffered a crushing defeat, losing fifty seats and becoming the minority party in Congress. The Democratic Party's crushing defeat is the result of the people's disgust and rejection of the reactionary domestic and foreign policies implemented by the ruling group of the party. As the French press said, "This election is a rebuke to President Truman." At the same time, the decrease in Democratic votes has also created an opportunity for the Republican Party to win this victory. The Republican Party's gaining a majority does not mean that the American people agree with its reactionary policies. On the contrary, they are rejecting the reactionaries and leaning towards progress. The defeat of eighteen isolationist congressmen and the re-election of progressive congressmen such as Sabath and MacDonough are proof of this. However, although the Republican Party's control of Congress will make U.S. policy more reactionary, it will not be able to solve the serious difficulties it faces. Its reactionary policies will inevitably arouse stronger opposition from the American people, making them more aware and united.

In the Soviet Union, the whole nation warmly celebrated its second national day after the war. A grand review of the armed forces defending democracy and peace was held in Red Square, and the working people celebrated the festival with new victories in production. Many factories and enterprises have completed their annual production plans, and many workers have created miracles on the production front. Boris, a filer at the Liecheng Machine Factory, has produced four years' worth of output, and he has begun to embark on the final year of the new five-year plan. On this day, important orders were issued by the Soviet armed forces, and a historically significant speech was delivered by Zhdanov, secretary of the All-Union Communist Party, emphasizing the irresistible nature of world peace and democracy after the war. This will further encourage the world's people to fight for democracy and peace. At the same time, Stalin's conversation with the president of the Associated Press and Molotov's speech to the United Nations General Assembly proposing universal disarmament have aroused enthusiastic praise and response in many countries around the world. Stalin's remarks were considered by the public opinion of Britain, France, Germany, and Poland as "a great hope for international relations" and a call for the establishment of lasting and just peace. Molotov's speech was supported by representatives of various countries at the United Nations General Assembly and responded to by progressive people in the United States. Wallace not only expressed his approval but also advocated that the United States "participate in the worldwide call for arms reduction." This reflects how unshakable the will of the world's people to yearn for justice and peace is.

In South America, under the iron heel of American imperialism, the Chilean Communist Party has participated in the government for the first time, serving as ministers of engineering, agriculture, and land. This marks a new page in the political history of Central and South America, with the great victory of the people's power.

    国际一周
    为各方注意的美国大选，已告结束，这是一周来国际上的重大事件之一。在这次大选中，共和党已获得胜利，它在参院和众院中已夺取了控制地位，民主党则遭受了惨败，丧失了五十个议席，变成了国会中的少数党。民主党的这一惨败，乃是该党统治集团实行反动的内外政策遭受人民厌恶与唾弃的结果。这正如法国报界所称“此次选举为对杜鲁门总统的斥责。”同时由于民主党票数减少，也造成了共和党此次获胜的机会。共和党之获多数，并非美国人民同意其反动政策，恰相反，他们是唾弃反动派和倾向进步的。十八个孤立派议员的落选、进步议员如萨巴兹及麦克唐尼奥等的蝉联便是明证。但共和党控制国会后，虽将使美国政策有更趋反动的危险，但它决然解决不了摆在它前面的严重困难。它的反动政策必将激起美国人民更强烈的反对，而使它们更加觉悟和团结起来。
    在苏联，全国人民热烈庆祝其战后第二度的国庆日。红场举行了保卫民主和平的武装力量的壮大检阅，劳动人民则以生产的新胜利来庆祝这一节日。许多工厂企业完成了全年的生产计划，许多工人更创造了生产战线上的奇迹。列城机器工厂锉工鲍里斯已出产了四年的产量，他已开始走上新五年计划最后一年头了。在这一天，苏联武装部队颁布了重要的命令，联共书记日丹诺夫发表了有历史意义演说，都强调了战后世界和平民主的不可抗拒。这将更鼓舞世界人民为民主和平而斗争的信念。同时斯大林答复合众社社长的谈话和莫洛托夫在联合国大会建议普遍裁军的讲演，已在世界许多国家内引起了热烈的赞许和响应。斯大林的谈话，英法德波的舆论俱认为是“国际关系的大希望”，是建立巩固与正义和平的召唤。莫洛托夫的讲演，获得了联合国大会各国代表的拥护和美国进步人士的响应。华莱士不仅表示赞同而且主张美国“参加全世界缩军的号召。”这反映了世界人民热望正义和平的意志是如何不可摇撼。
    在美帝国主义铁蹄下的南美，智利共产党已首次参加政府，担任工程农业土地各部长。这为中南美政治史写下人民力量伟大胜利的新的一页。
