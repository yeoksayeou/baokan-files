Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 14th: New York dispatch: The New York American Newspaper Association hosted a banquet on the evening of the 12th to entertain the foreign ministers' conference and delegates to the United Nations General Assembly. Molotov, Byrnes, Bevin, and heads of other national delegations attended. The Associated Press reported that Molotov delivered a speech at the banquet, stating that the Soviet Union is willing to cooperate with the United States on the issue of world disarmament in order to reach an agreement, thereby "guaranteeing to the people of the world that permanent peace will be ensured through the United Nations." Molotov pointed out that the Soviet Union has put forward a proposal for disarmament, and the United States has expressed support for this proposal, but has also put forward its own proposal. The Soviet side is willing to reach an agreement with the United States. When Byrnes spoke, he still focused on reiterating the points of the American proposal (the so-called supervision and security plan). Bevin stated: Britain participated in the Geneva World Disarmament Conference, but its outcome has caused disaster. If disarmament can guarantee universal implementation, the British government will certainly not lag behind.

    苏外长重申裁军
    贝纳斯贝文竟借词推托
    【新华社延安十四日电】纽约讯：纽约美国报界协会于十二日晚设宴招待外长会议与联合国大会各代表，莫洛托夫、贝纳斯、贝文及其他各国代表团团长俱到会。合众社报导：莫洛托夫在会上发表演说，表示苏联愿在世界裁军问题上与美国合作以求取协议。从而“向全球人民保证，借联合国以保障永久和平。”莫氏指出苏联已提出裁军之建议，美国对此建议曾表示支持，但又提出其自己之某种建议，苏联方面愿与美国获致协议。贝纳斯讲话时，仍注意于重申美国建议之点（即所谓监督保障计划）。贝文称：英国曾参加日内瓦世界裁军会议，但其结果已引起灾祸。如裁军果能保障普遍实行，英国政府自亦不落人后。
