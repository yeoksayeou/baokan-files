　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, November 7th: Moscow dispatch: Boris Vonditsky, a top Soviet political science expert, commented on the US congressional elections in a two-week lecture series in Red Star newspaper, stating that the differences between the US Democratic and Republican parties have never been so "insignificant" as they are now. Both hold similar views, which has found very clear expression in the field of American foreign policy, namely the so-called "tough on the Soviet Union" policy. Vonditsky also said that the real task of the leaders of the US Democratic and Republican parties is to create the appearance of a traditional struggle between them, in order to prevent the formation of a third party. He pointed out that the Democratic Party's current activities rely on centrists and right-wingers, but it was not these elements that guaranteed the Democratic Party's past victories. Wallace's departure from Truman's cabinet severely undermined the hopes of progressives and democrats for electoral victory. Although Democratic leaders revived Roosevelt for the purpose of the election, both the Republican and Democratic parties were equally determined to launch an offensive against the vital interests of the American people. Vonditsky strongly stated that the ruling groups of the Democratic and Republican parties are now the banners of the current reactionary goals of American industry and finance. The American people, with few exceptions, will have to choose between the two parties, whose platforms do not differ on major issues. In the United States, the victory of progressive forces mainly depends on the degree of activity and unity of the working masses, and on their awareness of the importance of elections during such a historically important period.

　　苏联鲍利斯评美国会选举
    共和民主两党都是反动旗帜
    【新华社延安七日电】莫斯科讯：苏联第一流政治科学专家鲍利斯·沃汀斯基是在红星报两星期连载讲座中，评论美国国会选举称：美国民主党与共和党之间的分歧，从来没有现在这样“微不足道”，两者持类同的观点，在美国外交政策的领域上，已找到极明白的表现，这外交政策，即所谓“对苏强硬”。沃氏又称：美国民主党与共和党领袖们的真实任务，乃欲表现似乎他们之间有着传统的斗争，以便阻止一个第三党的组成。他指出：在目前民主党的活动系凭借中派和右派分子，但过去保证民主党的胜利的，却并不是这些分子。华莱士离去杜鲁门内阁，严重的打击了进步分子和民主主义者对选举胜利的希望。虽然民主党领袖们为了选举的目的而重新捧出罗斯福，但是不仅共和党而且民主党都下了同样的决心，要对美国人民大众的切身利益进行一个攻势。沃氏力称：民主党和共和党的统治集团，现在已经是美国工业与财政方面当前反动目标的旗帜了。美国的人民，除少数例外，势将在两党之间进行选择，而该两党的纲领在重大问题上又是并无区别的。在美国，进步势力要胜利，主要的全靠工人群众活动与团结的程度如何以及他们在美国历史上这样责任重大的时期，对选举的重要性觉悟程度如何而定。
