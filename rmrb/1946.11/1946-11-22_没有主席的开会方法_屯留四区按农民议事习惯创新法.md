　　Meeting Methods Without a Chairman
　　Innovation by the Fourth District of Tunliu Based on Farmers' Deliberation Habits
　　[This newspaper's Yangcheng dispatch, 13th] The Fourth District of Tunliu is currently promoting new methods of leading meetings created by comrades Guo Xianqin, Bao Shangren, and others. This is a method suitable for farmers' deliberation habits. When holding a meeting, a chairman is not selected, and the meeting is not announced to be in session, because this approach often easily cools down the heated emotions of the masses when the meeting is announced to begin. The new method is to first convene activists before the meeting to discuss what issues need to be talked about, and the activists guide the discussion among the masses. They are both chairmen and members of the masses. When it is time to hold a meeting, everyone naturally gathers in clusters to "buzz" with discussion. Those leading the meeting listen to everyone's opinions in the midst of the buzzing and slowly guide the topic to the issues to be discussed. This way, there are more speakers and the content is richer. When the masses have incorrect opinions in their speeches, they are not corrected head-on, but rather questions are raised in an interrogative tone, posing questions from the side or the opposite perspective to solicit everyone's opinions, which easily breaks through everyone's thinking. Whether to hold large meetings, small meetings, or merge sub-meetings should be flexibly applied based on the emotions and demands of the masses. When holding a meeting in Cuiguo Village, Comrade Guo Xianqin saw that the masses wanted to speak, but they looked around and did not speak up. Knowing that they wanted to give opinions to the cadres, he immediately separated the cadres and the masses for discussion. The masses quickly gave their opinions to the cadres and then enthusiastically discussed how to liberate themselves. Comrade Li Shengtang discovered that when holding meetings in various villages, the men were all buzzing around, while the women sat in a pile without saying a word. He then organized the women to discuss together, and as a result, three women poured out their grievances, crying as they spoke, and insisted on having everyone listen until they were finished before leaving. By the end of the general meeting, all 364 women who participated had poured out their grievances. The women who originally did not speak were buzzing until midnight, with only one person not having spoken in the end. Regarding listening to reports, previously cadres and activists sat neatly, speaking one after another, which wasted most of the night. Those giving reports were as uneasy as if they were being examined, and they could not express the main points. Those listening were also tired. Recently, when the district held a general meeting, just as the district cadres were giving a report, suddenly two groups from Cuiguo and Yaogou came to report on their discussion situation, which was both wonderful and vivid. The general meeting immediately adopted this method: "Come whenever you want, talk whenever you want, ask anyone you meet." In this way, people kept coming to report, those who were silent came, the young came, the old farmers came, and the district and village cadres also came. Everyone said whatever they wanted, and the materials collected were both vivid and specific. The district is now calling on all villages to universally adopt this method of meeting and reporting to improve work and enliven the atmosphere.

　　没有主席的开会方法
    屯留四区按农民议事习惯创新法
    【本报阳城十三日电】屯留四区现正提倡着郭宪勤、暴尚仁等同志所创造的新的领导开会方法。这是一种适合农民议事习惯的方式。开会时不选主席，不宣布开会，因为这种作法常易使热哄哄的群众情绪因宣布开会而冷静起来，新的办法是，会前先召集积极分子商量，要谈几个什么问题，由积极分子在群众中引导。他们也是主席，也是群众，一到应该开会的时候，就听从大家自然地一堆一堆地“圪噪”。领导会议的人便在圪噪当中倾听大家的意见，并慢慢把话题引到要讨论的问题上来。这样发言人多，内容更丰富；群众在发言中有不正确意见时，也不正面去纠正，而用发疑问的口气，从侧面或反面提出问题，征求大家意见，这样很容易打通大家思想。开大会、小会或分会合拢，要根据群众情绪与要求灵活运用。崔郭村开会时，郭宪勤同志，看到群众想说话，左右看看不开言，知道是想对干部提意见，马上便把干部和群众分开来讨论，群众很快对干部提了意见，就热烈的谈起怎样翻身的问题来。李生堂同志发现各村开会时，男人都在乱圪噪，妇女们坐在一堆一句话不说，便把妇女组织在一起讨论，结果有三个妇女诉苦，诉的哭起来，拉住大家要叫听完才走。大会结束时，参加大会的三百六十四个妇女都诉了苦。原来不说话的妇女，每天噪到半夜最后只一个人没说话。关于听取汇报，以前是干部积极分子们整整齐齐坐着，说了一个又一个，整费大半夜时间。汇报的人像被考试一样的局促不安，也说不出中心意思来；听的人也都疲倦了。最近区里开大会，区干部正汇报间，忽然崔郭、窑沟两个小组来汇报他们讨论的情形，说的又精彩，又生动，大会立即采用了这个办法，“什么时候愿来就来，谁想谈谁谈，碰见人就问。”这样，不断有人来汇报，不哼气的人来了，年青的来了，老农民来了，区村干部也来了，大家有啥说啥，收集的材料又生动，又具体。该区现正号召各村普遍采用这种会议汇报方法，以改进工作，活跃空气。
