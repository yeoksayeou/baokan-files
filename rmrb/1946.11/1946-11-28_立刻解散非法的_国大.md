Immediately Dissolve the Illegal "National Assembly"

Jiang Jieshi once hoped that the illegal, divisive "National Assembly" he convened despite the opposition of the Communist Party and the people would, even if the Communist Party didn't participate, still be attended by the third party; even if the third party didn't participate, by dragging in a few figures from the Youth Party or the Democratic Socialist Party for window dressing, he could still deceive some of China's public opinion; even if he couldn't deceive China's public opinion, he could still deceive some of foreign public opinion, at least there would be some who, unaware of the truth, would say he had fulfilled his long-cherished wish to "return power to the people." He didn't expect that this show would turn out to be so embarrassing, unable to find a single cheering spectator after searching high and low! Domestically, the moderate _Ta Kung Pao_ compared Jiang Jieshi's plans for the "National Assembly" and "constitution-making" to the plans of Qin Shi Huang: "Concentrating power in one person, concentrating thought in one brain... This kind of ideological autocracy is incredibly brutal subjectively and forces national division and great chaos objectively." Abroad, not only Soviet radio commentators, but also the British _Times_, the American _New York Herald Tribune_, _Christian Science Monitor_, _Washington Star_, _Kansas City Star_, _St. Louis Post-Dispatch_, and even the _New York Times_, which usually supported Jiang Jieshi, all jointly declared the deceitfulness, divisiveness, and failure of Jiang Jieshi's "National Assembly." The uglier the drama of the power struggle within the "National Assembly's" ten-day preparatory meeting, the colder the spectators became. Under these embarrassing circumstances, besides the old "representatives" who had already become very disreputable ten years ago (many of whom declined to attend), almost everyone wanted to express their grievances to society or beg for a fair judgment from future historians in an attempt to salvage their openly sold political integrity. Even some Americans who had no direct connection with the "National Assembly" wanted to stay away and avoid the plague in Nanjing. Refusing to participate in the "National Assembly" has been publicly recognized as the boundary between loyalty and treachery, good and evil; the title of "Zeng Qi the First" is as shameful as that of a traitor! The world is so big, yet no one with common sense considers that this "National Assembly" will pass any beneficial democratic constitution or reduce Jiang Jieshi's dictatorship in the slightest. Jiang Jieshi deserves his current predicament, of course, as he reaps what he sows! But he is willing to sacrifice the country's position as a gamble to satisfy his personal desires, which makes all patriots unable to resist protesting in pain and anger!

Is there any way to solve the problem now? The only solution is the suggestion of the American _St. Louis Post-Dispatch_, which said: "The 'National Assembly' attempts to prettify the continuous rule of the Kuomintang, and those who harbor this kind of mystifying attempt believe (or at least think) that other countries are easily deceived. This disguise will be of no avail, and its deception is extremely obvious. Jiang's best policy is to dissolve the 'National Assembly' and then step back to promote the establishment of a representative government in China. The establishment of this government is his revolutionary goal." The last sentence shows how honest the _St. Louis Post-Dispatch_ is, as it would admit that establishing a representative government is Jiang Jieshi's "revolutionary goal"! Even such an honest bystander has risen up to demand that Jiang Jieshi dissolve the "National Assembly," which shows how necessary it is to dissolve this "National Assembly"! We do not have a more "radical" view than the _St. Louis Post-Dispatch_. We demand that Jiang Jieshi immediately dissolve this "National Assembly" that confirms dictatorship, confirms division, is a laughingstock to the world, and will stink for ten thousand years, and restore the validity of the Political Consultative Conference resolutions and the January ceasefire order. Although these agreements were unilaterally torn up by Jiang Jieshi, we still insist on fighting to the end for their realization.

As early as April 24th last year, Chinese Communist Party leader Mao Zedong warned Jiang Jieshi when he delivered a report to the Seventh National Congress of the Communist Party of China:

"Regardless of the demands of the broad masses of the people and all democratic parties, he obstinately convened a so-called 'National Assembly' entirely controlled by the Kuomintang anti-people clique. At this meeting, he passed a so-called 'constitution' that actually maintains dictatorship and opposes democracy, and puts a 'legal' cloak on the illegal so-called 'national' government, which is merely privately appointed by dozens of Kuomintang members and has no popular support, and pretends to 'return power to the people,' but in reality it is still 'returning power' to the anti-people clique within the Kuomintang. Anyone who disagrees is said to be undermining 'democracy' and undermining 'unity,' and there is a 'reason' to issue a punitive order against them. This is a divisive policy, and the Chinese people are resolutely opposed to this policy.

"The steps that our anti-people heroes are prepared to take based on this divisive policy have the danger of pushing themselves to a dead end. They are preparing to put a rope around their own necks and never untie it. The name of this rope is 'National Assembly.' Their original intention was to use the so-called National Assembly as a magic weapon, to resist the united government, maintain dictatorial rule, and prepare for reasons for civil war. But the logic of history will go in the opposite direction to what they envisioned: 'lifting a stone to drop it on one's own feet'!"

From that time on, the Communists demanded that Jiang Jieshi not take this dead end, hence the Chongqing negotiations after the Japanese surrender last year, hence the Political Consultative Conference resolutions in January this year, hence the Nanjing negotiations from June to November this year. Therefore, until the eve of the opening of the so-called "National Assembly," the CCP still suggested that it be suspended. But, unfortunately, Jiang Jieshi insisted on "putting a rope around his own neck" and insisted on "lifting a stone to drop it on his own feet." Now the rope has not yet reached the point where it can never be untied, but does Jiang Jieshi have the intelligence and courage to bell the cat and untie the bell? Knowledgeable observers within the Kuomintang, knowledgeable observers outside the Kuomintang, neutral foreign observers, and pro-Jiang Jieshi foreign observers all believe that implementing the divisive policy of the so-called "National Assembly" is a dead end for Jiang Jieshi. _Ta Kung Pao's_ editorial on the 21st quoted the story of King Wu of Zhou's conquest of King Zhou of Shang from _Lüshi Chunqiu_, implying that Jiang Jieshi's autocratic rule is on the verge of the last days of King Zhou of Shang. The _New York Herald Tribune's_ editorial on the 13th stated: "It would be fortunate if the Chinese leaders who abide by democracy could dominate the National Assembly. If they do not have this power, the constitution produced by the National Assembly may become the basis for reaction." The "National Assembly" had not yet opened on the 13th. By the 19th, the newspaper confirmed that "those who listened to Chairman Jiang's speech at the opening of the 'National Assembly' were all reactionaries," and predicted that even if Jiang Jieshi could continue to obtain economic and military assistance from the United States for the civil war, it would still be "a losing game." Jiang Jieshi's political chess game has been lost, and his military chess game is about to be lost as well. However, whether it is Jiang Jieshi himself, the "CC clique" under Jiang Jieshi (they are the main organizers of the "National Assembly"), or the warlord groups under Jiang Jieshi (they are continuing to organize the war to attack the liberated areas), they seem to have lost the necessary reason to listen to the warnings of the CCP and all parties at home and abroad. According to reliable sources, Jiang Jieshi was very frustrated when he saw the arrival of failure at the opening of the "National Assembly." But even so, he is still determined to be reactionary to the end. We Communists advocate being kind to others. If Jiang Jieshi immediately dissolves the so-called "National Assembly," implements the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and restores the military positions of January 13th, then we can still see him as the prodigal son in the Bible who returns home. If not, since he does not want the forgiveness of the people, the people will not be able to forgive him either.

### 立刻解散非法的“国大”

专栏：

　　立刻解散非法的“国大”
    解放日报二十四日社论
    蒋介石曾经希望他不顾共产党和人民的反对而召开的非法的分裂的“国大”，即使共产党不参加，第三方面还是会参加；即使第三方面也不参加，拉上青年党或民社党的若干人物点缀一下，还是可以蒙混一些中国的舆论界；即使蒙混不了中国的舆论界，还是可以蒙混一些外国的舆论界，至少总会有些不明真相者说他是偿了“还政于民”的宿愿之类。他是没有料到这出戏演出来竟至如此难堪，踏破铁鞋无处觅到一个喝彩的看客！在国内，温和的大公报把蒋介石关于“国大”和“制宪”的计划，比之为秦始皇的计划：“集权力于一人，集思想于一个脑袋……这种思想专制，在主观上是无比的凶暴，在客观上是迫使国家分裂，天下大乱”。在国外，不但苏联的广播评论员，而且英国的泰晤士报、美国的纽约先锋论坛报、基督教科学箴言报、华盛顿星报、甘萨斯星报、圣路易斯邮报，以至素来替蒋介石捧场的纽约时报，都共同宣告蒋介石“国大”的欺骗性、分裂性和失败性。“国大”十天预备会，争夺主席团的丑剧闹得愈热，看客就看得愈冷。在这种狼狈情形之下，“国大”中除了十年前就已弄得很不名誉的那批旧“代表”（其中还有不少人谢绝出场）以外，几乎人人都要向社会表明苦衷，或者乞怜于后世历史家之公断，以图挽救其公开出卖的政治节操。甚至与“国大”本无直接瓜葛的某些美国人，也要远走避嫌，躲开南京的瘟疫。拒绝参加“国大”与否，已被公认为忠奸善恶的分界，“曾琦第一”的头衔，已与汉奸一样可耻！世界之大，竟没有一个有常识的人考虑这个“国大”会通过一个什么有利的民主的宪法，会丝毫减少蒋介石的独裁。蒋介石自己落得今天这个下场，当然是种瓜得瓜自作自受！但是他为了逞个人的私欲，不惜拿国家的地位来做孤注一掷的牺牲品，这却使一切爱国者不能不痛愤抗议！
    事到于今，还能有什么解救办法没有呢？唯一的解救方法，就是美国圣路易斯邮报的建议，该报说：“国民大会”企图为持续国民党统治粉饰，怀有此项故弄玄虚企图之人，咸信（或至少认为）其他国家容易欺骗。此项伪装将无济于事，其骗局亦极明显。蒋氏之上策，乃为解散“国大”，继即退而促使中国成立一代表性政府。盖建立此项政府，本即渠之革命目标也”。末了一句话，表明圣路易斯邮报何等老实，他会承认建立代表性的政府是蒋介石的“革命目标”！而连这样老实的旁观者，也起来要求蒋介石解散“国大”，又可见这个“国大”是如何非解散不可！我们没有比圣路易斯邮报更“激烈”的见解，我们要求蒋介石立即解散这个确定独裁、确定分裂、贻笑万邦、遗臭万年的“国大”，恢复政协决议与一月停战令的效力。这些协定虽然被蒋介石片面撕毁，我们是仍旧坚持为它们的实现而奋斗到底的。
    早在去年四月二十四日，中国共产党领袖毛泽东在他向中共第七次全国代表大会做报告的时候，就已经警告蒋介石说：
    “不顾广大人民及一切民主党派的要求，一意孤行地召开一个由国民党反人民集团一手包办的所谓‘国民大会’，在这个会上通过一个实际上维持独裁反对民主的所谓‘宪法’，使那个仅仅由几十个国民党人私自裘任的完全没有民意基础的强安在人民头上的不合法的所谓‘国民’政府披上‘合法’的外衣，装模作样地‘还政于民’，实际上依然是‘还政’于国民党内的反人民集团。谁要不赞成，就说他是破坏‘民主’，破坏‘统一’，就有‘理由’向他宣布讨伐令。这是一个分裂的方针，中国人民是坚决反对这个方针的。
    “我们的反人民的英雄们根据这种分裂方针所准备采取的步骤，有把他自己推到绝路上去的危险性，他们准备把一条绳索套在自己的脖子上，并且让它永远也解不开，这条绳索的名称就叫做‘国民大会’。他们的原意是想把所谓国民大会当作法宝，祭起来一则抵制联合政府，二则维持独裁统治，三则准备内战理由的。可是历史的逻辑将向他们所设想的反面走去：‘搬起石头打自己的脚’！……”
    共产党人从那时起，就要求蒋介石不要走这条绝路，因此而有去年日本投降后的重庆谈判，因此而有今年一月的政协决议，因此而有今年六月直至十一月的南京谈判。因此，直至所谓“国大”开幕的前夜，中共还建议它停开。但是，不幸蒋介石偏要“把一条绳索套在自己的脖子上”，偏要“搬起石头打自己的脚”。现在绳索还没有到永远解不开的时候，但是蒋介石有没有这样的聪明和勇气来系铃解铃呢？国民党内有头脑的观察家、国民党外有头脑的观察家、外国中立的观察家、外国亲蒋介石的观察家，都认为实行所谓“国民大会”的分裂方针，对于蒋介石乃是一条死路。大公报二十一日的社评，引用吕氏春秋上武王伐纣的故事，暗示蒋介石的专制统治已经濒于商纣末日的险境。纽约先锋论坛报十三日的社论称：“遵守民主之中国领袖若能在国大中占优势，则诚为值得庆幸之事，若彼等未有此项力量，即国大所产生之宪法可能成为反动之张本”。十三日“国大”还没有开，到了十九日该报就证实了在“国大”开幕时，“听蒋主席演说的都是反动分子”，并且预见到蒋介石即令还可以继续从美国获得内战的经济和军事援助，但乃是“一局输棋”。蒋介石的政治棋局已经输光了，他的军事棋局眼看也要输光，但是无论是蒋介石本人也好，蒋介石手下的“ＣＣ”也好（他们是“国大”的主要组织者），蒋介石部下的军阀集团也好（他们正在继续组织进攻解放区的战争），他们似乎都失去了必要的理智来倾听中共和国内外各方的警告了。据确实的消息说，蒋介石在“国大”开幕时，因为看到失败的袭来而十分懊丧。但是虽然如此，他还是决心反动到底。我们共产党人是提倡与人为善的，如果蒋介石现在立即解散所谓“国大”，实行政协的决议，恢复一月十三日的军事位置，那么我们还可以看他做圣经上所说的回头的浪子，如果不然，他既不要人民的原谅，人民也就无法原谅他了。
