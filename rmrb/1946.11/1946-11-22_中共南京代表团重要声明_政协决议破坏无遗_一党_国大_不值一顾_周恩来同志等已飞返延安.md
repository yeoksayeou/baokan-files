　　Yan'an Xinhua Radio Broadcast on the 19th: Nanjing, 16th (Delayed) General Zhou Enlai of the CCP Delegation in Nanjing, held a press conference on the afternoon of the 16th, issuing an important statement: The Chinese Communist Party resolutely opposes the "National Assembly" which is a one-hand operation and splittist, conducted by the Kuomintang government authorities in violation of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) resolutions. According to the PCC resolutions, the National Assembly can only be convened after the PCC resolutions are implemented and under the leadership of a reorganized government. General Zhou continued to list facts from the past ten months, proving that the Kuomintang government had completely undermined the PCC resolutions in all aspects, proving that this so-called "National Assembly" is a thoroughly one-party-controlled and splittist "National Assembly". General Zhou pointed out: The so-called leaving of vacancies to wait for the CCP to participate is both a violation of the PCC resolutions and a deceptive trick. In reality, it is intended to deceive other parties besides the CCP into participating, in order to gloss over the Kuomintang authorities' personal dictatorship. General Zhou stated: The one-party "National Assembly" that is now opening has ultimately destroyed all resolutions, cease-fire agreements, and military reorganization plans since the PCC. The Chinese Communist Party resolutely does not recognize this so-called "National Assembly." The door to peace has been closed single-handedly by the Kuomintang authorities. We have no need to consider what tricks will be played in the one-party "National Assembly," or even the reorganization of the government. Participating in this "National Assembly" and acknowledging these tricks will inevitably overturn the PCC resolutions and the peaceful and democratic path since the PCC. There is no middle ground! General Zhou concluded: The bloody battles to attack the Liberated Areas are in full swing, and the U.S. government's policy of aiding Chiang in the civil war has not changed. If false peace and false democracy cannot deceive anyone, the CCP is willing to work together with the Chinese people and all parties that truly strive for peace and democracy!
    【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th】This morning, Zhou Enlai, Deng Yingchao, and Li Weihan of the CCP Nanjing Delegation, along with more than ten members of their entourage, flew to Yan'an.

　　中共南京代表团重要声明
    政协决议破坏无遗
    一党“国大”不值一顾
    周恩来同志等已飞返延安
    【延安新华电台十九日广播】南京十六日电（迟到）中共驻南京代表团周恩来将军，于十六日下午举行记者招待会，发表重要声明称：对国民党政府当局违犯政协决议，一手包办的、分裂的“国大”，中国共产党坚决反对。按照政协决议，必须在政协决议实施之后，在改组后的政府领导之下，才能召开国大。周将军继续列举十个月以来的事实，证明国民党政府，在各方面都把政协决议破坏无遗，证明这一个所谓“国大”是彻头彻尾的一党包办的、分裂的“国大”。周将军指出：所谓空出名额，等待中共参加，既是破坏政协决议，又是骗局。实际是想骗取中共以外的其他党派参加，以粉饰国民党当局个人独裁的面目而已。周将军表示：现在开幕的一党“国大”，最后破坏了政协以来的一切决议、停战协定与整军方案，中国共产党坚决不承认这个所谓“国大”。和平之门已被国民党当局一手关闭，一党“国大”中将要玩什么把戏，乃至改组政府，我们绝无一顾之必要。参加了这一“国大”，承认了这些把戏，必然推翻了政协决议和政协以来的和平民主的轨道，中间的道路是没有的！周将军结语称：进攻解放区之血战方殷，美国政府援蒋内战的政策未变，假如平假民主骗不了人；中共愿同中国人民及一切真正努力和平民主的党派，共同为真和平真民主而奋斗！
    【新华社延安十九日电】今日上午中共南京代表团周恩来、邓颖超、李维汉偕随员十余人飞抵延安。
