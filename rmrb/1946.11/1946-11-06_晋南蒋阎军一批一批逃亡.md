[This dispatch comes from Taiyue on the 2nd] Morale among the Jiang-Yan troops in Southern Shanxi is low, and desertions are rampant and frequently reported. Zhang Sanwa, a soldier from the 500th Regiment of the 167th Brigade of the Chiang army, along with nine others, deserted from Shucun during the attack on Hongdong and surrendered to the Eighth Route Army. Yan Xishan ordered his troops to "practice night tiger heart-piercing warfare," i.e., sudden night attacks using bayonets, creating good opportunities for soldiers to desert. In mid-September, during "live practice" in the wilderness at night by the 4th Company of the 2nd Battalion of the 218th Division of the 73rd Army, stationed in Ninggu Fu, Pingyao, more than ten soldiers deserted with their weapons. When the Yan army discovered this, it sent troops to pursue them, resulting in a "real battle." After firing over two hundred shots, the deserters broke through the encirclement and escaped. At the end of September, four men from a squad in a certain company of the Zhu Huanan Department of the 3rd Regiment of the 37th Division of the Yan army, stationed in Jinling City, Pingyao, collectively deserted while the brigade headquarters was away "practicing." Furthermore, because the Yan army stationed in Hongshan, Jiexiu, and other places was close to our district, desertions were so numerous that night "practice" was stopped. To prevent desertions, Yan Xishan shamelessly utilized the purely Japanese "Security Column" he established in September. The commander, Iwata, was originally a staff officer in the Japanese army. During exercises, they secretly deployed along roadsides and alleys to monitor the troops, or the two armies conducted exercises together. Moreover, in his September "handwritten order" regarding battlefield discipline, he specifically stipulated that officers who abandoned their posts without orders, soldiers who fired their guns into the air or looked backward, soldiers who whispered to each other or fabricated enemy situations on the battlefield, and those who showed cowardice or fear in front of the battle line would all be "punished on the spot."

　　晋南蒋阎军一批一批逃亡
    【本报太岳二日电】晋南蒋阎军部队充满厌战情绪，逃风日炽，时有所闻。蒋军一六七旅五○○团士兵张三娃等十名，于进攻“洪洞”时，由蜀村逃出，向八路军投诚。阎锡山令他的部队“实练夜老虎穿心战”。即夜间猛袭的白光战，给士兵造成了逃跑的好机会。九月中旬，驻平遥宁固阜之阎军，七十三军二一八师二营四连，在黑夜野外“实练”时，即有十余人携械逃跑。被阎军发觉后，派部追击，结果演成“实战”。打了二百余枪，逃者冲出重围跑掉。九月末，驻平遥、金陵城之阎军卅七师三团朱化南部某连一个班四人，乘大队部都去“实练”之际，也集体逃跑。另外，驻介休洪山等地之阎军，因和我区接近，逃亡过多，乃停止夜间“实练”。阎锡山为防止逃跑，即无耻的利用他在九月成立的纯日人“保安纵队”，队长岩田系，原为日本军之参谋。每逢演习时，即密布在路旁巷口监视，或两军混合演习。并在九月“手令”的战场纪律中，特定出军官无令弃守者，士兵朝天放枪及向后看者，战地士兵互相私语及假造敌情者，阵前畏缩示弱恐惧者等，均就地“制裁”。
