　　From the Taiyue area, November 25th: The masses in the Tongpu Railway area and vast areas of northern Henan are universally launching an anti-"reverse settlement" movement, which has now penetrated from the border areas of the newly liberated areas to the areas occupied by Chiang. The "reverse settlement" elements are mostly local tyrants and special agents who have fled from the liberated areas, relying on the power of Chiang's army to form "reverse settlement teams," "revenge teams," and other anti-people special agent armed forces, confiscating the land and property already gained by the people, and carrying out assassinations. In order to defend their fruits of liberation, the peasants of Yuanqu, Wangwu, Jiyuan, Lingshi, Huo County, Hongdong, Zhaocheng, Pinglu, and other counties have participated in the anti-"reverse settlement" movement. In the past two months, the people of Yuanqu have gone deep into Chiang-occupied areas to capture "reverse settlement team" members. In particular, the militia of the Second District of Yuanqu, when attacking the GaoLuo stronghold on September 26th, killed on the spot the special agent leader Cao LaoSan (Jin Rong) and Chang DaiShan, who were leading the "reverse settlement team," and captured more than ten "reverse settlement" elements, and returned their "reverse settled" items to the peasants intact. On October 19th, Wu DaoLong, a local tyrant from Yucheng Village in the First District of Lingshi, led a "revenge team" back to his village to forcibly carry out "reverse settlement." The peasants hated him to the bone. That night, they stormed into the bedroom of the treacherous tyrant Wu DaoLong and captured him alive. The masses were overjoyed when they heard the news. The militia of the Sixth District of Jiyuan, in the universal movement to oppose "reverse settlement" and protect the interests of the masses, launched attacks everywhere. In the past two months, they have successively defeated several attacks by puppet troops and special agent "reverse settlement teams," killing or wounding a total of 38 enemies and capturing alive the puppet army leader Zhang ZhiGong and 16 members of the "reverse settlement team."

    【本报太岳二十五日电】同蒲线及豫北广大地区群众普遍展开反“倒算”运动，现已由新解放区边沿地区深入至蒋占区。“倒算”分子多系由解放区潜逃的恶霸特务，恃蒋军势力组成“倒算队”“复仇队”等反人民特务武装，及没收人民既得土地财产，进行暗杀活动。农民为保卫自己翻身果实，已有垣曲、王屋、济源、灵石、霍县、洪洞、赵城、平陆等县广大农民，参加反“倒算”运动。两月来垣曲人民，深入蒋占区，捕捉“倒算队”分子。尤其是垣曲二区民兵，在九月二十六日，袭击皋落据点时，当场打死领导“倒算队”的特务头子曹老三（近荣）、常代山，抓回“倒算”分子十余人，并将其“倒算”的东西原封发还农民。十月十九日，灵石一区玉成村恶霸吴道龙率领“复仇队”，回到本村来强迫“倒算”，农民恨之入骨，当夜，群起冲进奸霸吴道龙卧室，把吴道龙生擒活捉回来，群众闻讯莫不拍手称快。济源六区民兵，在反“倒算”保卫群众利益的普遍运动下，到处出击，近两月来先后击溃伪军及特务“倒算队”等数次进攻，共毙伤敌人三十八名，活捉伪军头子张志功及“倒算队”等十六人。
