    Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 9th. Wang Duanben, son of Mr. Wang Zhangfeng, a retired Northwest Army officer and respected elder in Weinan, who was assassinated by spies sent by Hu Zongnan, has submitted a letter to the Dazhong Daily at the Lunan Administrative Office, denouncing the crimes of Chiang's spies to the entire country. The letter reads in part: "Upon hearing the shocking news that Hu Zongnan recently dispatched spies to assassinate ten retired Northwest Army officers and local dignitaries, including my father Wang Zhangfeng, I was heartbroken and filled with grief and indignation. For twenty-five years, my father strived for the revolution and dedicated himself to local education, never seeking personal gain. As a student, he joined the Kuomintang. In the tenth year of the Republic, he founded the Danshui Vocational School in his hometown, educating young people with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary ideas. In the thirteenth year of the Republic, he served as a political instructor at the Whampoa Military Academy and as the director of the Political Department of General Feng Yuxiang's Fifth Route Army during the Northern Expedition. When Feng entered Shaanxi, he left the military and founded the Xi'an Daily and the Northwest Cultural Daily, dedicating himself to cultural endeavors. Later, his views and advocacy were intolerable to the Kuomintang reactionaries, forcing him to go to southern Henan, and his family property was confiscated. I wandered around, and I heard that my father was able to return to his hometown in the twenty-second year. I participated in the revolutionary war of resistance during the Xi'an Incident and later joined the Eighth Route Army in Shandong. After the Japanese surrendered, I looked forward to reuniting with my father, but Chiang's spies struck a deadly blow. Chiang Kai-shek betrays the country for personal gain, launches a civil war, and massacres the people! His brutal crimes are appalling! I not only appeal to the whole country based on the love between father and son, but also call on all righteous people in society to rise up and fight for personal freedom and the guarantee of life and safety, and resolutely smash Chiang Kai-shek's offensive against the people!"

    一字一把泪一句一滴血
    王端本控诉蒋特杀父
    【新华社山东九日电】西北军在乡军官渭南耆绅王章峰先生，遭胡宗南派遣特务暗杀后，其子王端本顷于鲁中行署投书大众日报，向全国控诉蒋记特务的罪行。原书略称：“惊闻胡宗南于日前派遣特务暗杀西北军在乡军官及社会贤达十人，我父王章峰亦被惨杀，不禁心胆欲裂，悲愤填膺。二十五年来，我父为革命努力，为地方兴学，未尝作室家之谋，在学生时代，即参加国民党。民国十年，于家乡创办淡水职业学校，以孙中山先生之革命思想，教育青年。民国十三年，任黄埔军校政治教官，北伐时代任冯玉祥将军之第五路军政治部主任。迨冯氏入陕，始脱离军职，曾创办西安日报及西北文化日报等，致力文化事业，后因其立论与主张为国民党反动派所不容，被迫去豫南，家产横遭查封，端本即到处漂流，闻我父于二十二年，始得返乡，我在西安事变时，参加革命抗战，后随八路军入鲁，日寇投降后，方期父子重聚，蒋记特务竟下毒手，蒋介石卖国求荣，发动内战，屠杀人民，其残暴罪行，令人发指！我不仅以父子之情向全国控诉，更呼吁社会正义人士，奋起争取人身自由与生命安全之保障。坚决粉碎蒋介石向人民之进攻。”
