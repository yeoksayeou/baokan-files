　　Shanghai Dispatch: Overseas Chinese returning from the U.S. military occupied area of Korea on the 2nd, reported to reporters: Since Kim Gu and Syngman Rhee successively returned to the country, overseas Chinese in southern Korea have been subjected to various abuses. There have been more than 200 cases of overseas Chinese being harmed and beaten. Recently, people in southern Korea launched armed uprisings against the pro-American and South Korean reactionaries. The Kim Gu government, in an attempt to divert the people's attention, launched an anti-Chinese movement, stirring up friendship between the Chinese and Korean people.
　　London Dispatch: Reuters correspondent in Moscow, Donald, said after returning to London from the Soviet Union: "Since I recently left the Soviet Union, countless people have asked me 'Does the Soviet Union want war?' 'Will there be a war against the Soviet Union?' There is no doubt that the Soviet Union does not want war, because after suffering through war, it must engage in reconstruction and improve the people's living standards. However, the Soviet Union is determined to guarantee its security, which it will never neglect. The reactionaries in the US and Britain are preparing for war against the Soviet Union, so the Soviet people believe that appropriate military preparations are regrettable but necessary." The reporter went on to emphasize that the claim that the domestic situation in the Soviet Union is poor is absolutely not true. Regarding the so-called Iron Curtain, the reporter believes it is "an exaggeration."
　　Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Moscow radio commentator Borisova criticized Vandenberg as the greatest reactionary in the United States, whose glib tongue is used to conceal his thoughts. Vandenberg condemns those who talk glibly about war, but he opposed the shipment of weapons to Spain in 1937, and today advocates arming China, because weapons to Spain were helping democracy, while weapons to China are helping reactionaries.
　　Bucharest Dispatch: The Romanian government issued a note to Britain on the 2nd, rejecting Britain's note to Romania on the 25th of last month requesting to monitor the general election to be held on November 19th. The note stated: This is an unreasonable interference in Romania's internal affairs and an attempt to violate the country's sovereignty.

　　国际简讯
    沪讯：二日由朝鲜美军占领区返国之侨胞向记者声诉：朝鲜南部的华侨自金九李承晚相继返国后，即遭种种虐待，华侨被残害与殴打有二百余起。近来朝鲜南部人民于反对美韩反动派时曾发生武装起义。金九政府为图转移人民视线，发动排华运动，挑拨中韩人民友谊。
    伦敦讯：路透社驻莫斯科记者唐乐自苏返伦敦后谈称：“我最近离苏后，向我询问‘苏联愿战否’‘将有对苏战争乎’的人已不知凡几，苏联之不愿战争毫无疑义，因饱经战争之余，必须从事复兴，并提高人民生活水准，但苏联决心保障安全，此为其决不疏忽之事。美英之反动派正向苏联备战，因此苏联人认为适当之军备实为可遗憾但属必需之事。该记者继着重指出苏联国内情形欠佳之说绝不确实，对于所谓铁幕之说，该记者认为系“过甚其辞”。
    新华社讯：莫斯科广播评论员鲍里索瓦抨击范登堡为美国最大的反动分子，他的如簧之舌是用来掩盖他的思想。范登堡谴责奢谈战争的人，但是他在一九三七年时反对武器运往西班牙，而在今天即主张武装中国，因为武器运往西班牙是帮助民主，而武器运华即是帮助反动派。
    布加勒斯特讯：罗马尼亚政府已于二日照会英国，拒绝英国上月廿五日致罗国照会中要求监察将于十一月十九日举行之大选。照会内称：这是对罗马尼亚内政的无理干涉及企图侵犯该国主权。
