    Parting Words
    Zhou Fei, Deputy Company Commander of the Eighth Company, Third Battalion, 51st Regiment, 17th Brigade, 38th Division

    We are leaving, heading towards the dark and hopeless rear. If it weren't for family ties, who would want to go back?

    When we entered the liberated area in early August, we traveled eight or nine hundred *li*, receiving all kinds of preferential treatment along the way. The accompanying political work comrades introduced us to many of the policies and situations in the liberated area. We saw the land reform movement of the masses in the liberated area and the spirit of close kinship and mutual assistance between the army and the people. We sincerely admired it. Unfortunately, these good things are only being implemented in a part of China. I hope you will continue your efforts and strive for the realization of democracy throughout China. You represent the demands of the people of the whole country, advance bravely! You are bound to succeed!

    Finally, we would also like to express our special thanks for the care and attention we received in all aspects from the comrades of the Political Department during the month or so we were in the military region, especially for helping us see through the deception and rumors of the Kuomintang reactionaries. The warmongering elements within the Kuomintang must bear the responsibility for destroying the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. They will surely be punished by justice in the future!

    We are leaving, goodbye!!

    临别寄语
    三十八师十七旅五一团三营八连副连长周飞
    我们走了，向着暗无天日的大后方去，如没有家庭的牵连，谁愿回去呢？
    当我们八月初进入了解放区，东西走了八九百里的路程，沿途受着各种优待，随伴的政工同志们介绍了解放区很多的施政情形，我们看到了解放区群众的翻身运动，看到了军民一家亲热互助的精神，我们实在衷心钦佩。可惜，这些良心好的东西仅仅才实行于中国的一部分地区，我希望你们继续努力，争取民主在全中国实现。你们代表全国人民的要求，英勇的前进吧！你们必然成功！
    最后，我们还要特别表示感谢的，是来军区后的一个多月中，蒙政治部同志各方面照顾，特别是帮我们识破了国民党反动派的欺骗造谣。国民党内的好战分子要负破坏政协决议的责任。将来他一定要受到公理的责罚！
    我们走了，再见吧！！
