How to Write About Soldiers?
    Sun Dingguo

    This article is excerpted from Comrade Sun Dingguo's "Writing About Soldiers." (The original text, in addition to how to write about soldiers, also discusses the review of the achievements of writing about soldiers in the Taiyue region, writing about soldiers by soldiers and non-soldiers, and the need to strengthen leadership and organize forces in the future. Published in the Taiyue edition of Xinhua Daily on October 11th.) Comrade Sun is the Deputy Commander of the Taiyue Military Region and strongly promotes literature to serve the soldiers. We have put forward the idea of culture serving the soldiers, but how can writing about soldiers serve the soldiers? Please listen to the opinions of this general who leads troops. It provides us with very clear and specific methods for writing about soldiers. We hope that comrades who care about serving the soldiers will pay attention and discuss it.

    Use diverse forms to write about all aspects of soldiers, while also grasping the main aspects.

    The entire life of a soldier is extremely rich and extremely complex. The peasant emancipation movement was filled with the complexity of society and class, and as peasants took up arms and embarked on armed struggle, their complexity increased with the increase in guns. The entire life of a soldier includes peacetime, wartime, education, and combat. Education has various methods, and combat also has various forms, including external struggle against the enemy and internal ideological struggle, which is very complex and very rich. Anyone who looks at soldiers with a simple eye will never be able to seriously write about soldiers, and will never be able to write about soldiers. It is generally believed that combat scenes are difficult to write, and yet they are the most frequently written about (in communications, reports, and dramas), which is correct. Because soldiers are primarily focused on combat, and combat is the highest requirement and concentrated expression of soldiers in all aspects. Writing about soldiers must involve writing about combat, and must grasp this main aspect. However, on the other hand, to write about the concentrated aspect, one must involve the other aspects that make it possible to concentrate. Therefore, writing about combat must also involve writing about education, writing about wartime must also involve writing about peacetime, and writing about external struggle against the enemy must also involve writing about internal ideological struggle. Writing about grand and heroic scenes must also involve writing about ordinary things, writing about officer-soldier relations must also involve writing about military-civilian relations. For example, the scene of climbing ladders to attack Hongzhao cities is the best theme for writing, but for thousands of troops to enter the city and remain incorruptible, without violating the people at all, not only is it widely praised by the masses, but even missionaries have to praise it loudly. Can it be said that this is easy to achieve? Hasn't there been a serious struggle within us regarding discipline education? And isn't this a model of the people's army? Wouldn't writing about it be a good theme with both propaganda and educational significance? Expanding the field and aspects of writing about soldiers can reveal the entire life of a soldier.

    Solving this problem should not be misunderstood as concentrating all aspects of a soldier into one creation, but must use diverse forms to write. Therefore, choose the topic according to the material, tailor the clothes to the figure, choose the bottle to hold the wine, adapt the form to the content, drama for drama, poetry for poetry, novel for novel, sing what can be sung, paint what can be painted, woodcut what can be woodcut, photograph what can be photographed. With diverse forms and diverse content, the entire life of a soldier will be presented to people. And its main aspects will naturally become more distinct and prominent, and the main aspects will find their basis in other aspects.

    In the current situation, vigorously promoting written documentary literature is also an urgent task. Combat records, life records, training records, production and learning records, as long as they are recorded, they will be good works, without any need for embellishment. Articles about blood, sweat, and struggle are more vivid and powerful than other articles. Vigorously promote it, those with pens write with pens, those without pens write orally, if one person can't write it, everyone writes it together; promoting soldiers' documentary literature is a very good method in writing, adapting to the tense war environment and the characteristics of military life. Using this method, the forms are still diverse.

    Learn from soldiers, seek soldiers' approval.

    Soldiers' approval is the basic standard for writing about soldiers. Without soldiers' approval, any other good evaluation is not valid, whether it's soldiers writing about soldiers or non-soldiers writing about soldiers. Especially for non-soldiers writing about soldiers, to achieve this goal, one must earnestly learn from soldiers, go to the barracks, go to the trenches, learn from soldiers' lives, learn from soldiers' activities, and study repeatedly thousands of times to experience soldiers, understand soldiers, and make oneself as combat-ready as soldiers in life, language, emotion, and character. To achieve non-soldiers writing about soldiers, not an outsider writing about an insider, but an insider writing about an insider, as familiar as soldiers writing about soldiers. In a word, non-soldiers writing about soldiers should actually "militarize" themselves. Only by "militarizing" themselves can they write about real soldiers. This is not impossible for writers in our liberated areas. Years of combat life, going through life and death together, has laid the foundation for them to "militarize." Now it is a matter of continuing to deepen and improve.

    Those engaged in propaganda and education work in the military must also earnestly learn from the companies, become more combat-ready, and then your work will be approved, welcomed, and loved by the majority of soldiers. In 1944, the Propaganda Team of the First Sub-district once blazed a new path in writing about soldiers. Many propaganda comrades lived and fought alongside soldiers, conducted investigations and research before starting to write, and then submitted their writing to the soldiers for review. Some, under the guidance of soldier-teachers, revised it again and again, three or five times, until finally approved and finalized. This process of coming from the soldiers and going to the soldiers, being a student and then being a teacher, greatly transformed the authors. One comrade failed the most times, but as a result, he was transformed the most, and greatly strengthened the relationship between cultural soldiers and combat soldiers. When their writings were published, they remembered the author, cared about your difficulties, and inquired about your news. After the battle, they would send you lovely small war trophies (of course, the author did not write for these gifts), expressing their passionate love for you, and informing you of valuable materials currently available for writing, thereby greatly developing the works of writing about soldiers. "The Party" and "A Group of Heroes" were produced in this process. Although they are not yet completely mature works, some are particularly welcomed by the soldiers and the masses. I feel that this method needs to be greatly developed. Without this, the soldiers will not approve. For example, a comrade described his painting of soldiers. After a long period of exploration, he felt that painting soldiers should learn from soldiers. He found a fully armed soldier and painted him for five days before being approved. This approval made him realize that in the past he had painted soldiers who were not very soldier-like, just like it took eight people to lift a rail with difficulty, but he painted two people lifting it easily and happily. How could that be approved? This nearby example should draw the attention of all comrades who write about soldiers.

### 怎样写兵？

　　怎样写兵？
    孙定国
    这篇文章是从孙定国同志“写兵”一文里摘录出来的。（原文除怎样写兵外，更谈到对太岳区写兵成绩的回顾与兵来写兵、非兵写兵，及今后应加强领导，组织力量等问题。载十月十一日太岳版新华日报。）孙同志是太岳军区副司令员，提倡文艺为兵服务甚力。我们提出了文化为兵服务，但怎样写兵才能为兵服务呢？请听听这位带兵的将军的意见吧。它给我们非常明确、具体的提供了写兵的方法。希望关心为兵服务的同志们注意和讨论。
    用多样的形式写兵的各方面，同时抓住主要的方面
    兵的全部生活是极其丰富极其复杂的。农民翻身运动是充满了社会的阶级的复杂性，而农民拿起枪来，走上武装斗争，也随着枪的增加，而增加其复杂性。兵的全部生活，有平时，有战时，有教育，有战斗。教育有各种方法，战斗也有各种形式，有外部的对敌斗争，又有内部的思想斗争，是十分复杂而又十分丰富的。谁要是以简单眼光看兵，谁就永远不能认真写兵，谁就永远写不出兵来。写兵一般认为战斗场面难写，而又以写战斗场面为最多（通讯、报导、戏剧，大部是如此），这是对的。因为兵以战斗为主，战斗是兵在各方面最高的要求和集中的表现。写兵就必须多写战斗，必须抓住这主要的方面。但是另一方面，要写集中的一面，就不能不涉及其所以能集中的其他方面。因之写战斗又要写教育，写战时又要写平时，写外部的对敌斗争又要写内部的思想斗争。写轰轰烈烈的场面又要写平平凡凡的事物、写官兵关系又要写军民关系。例如攻克洪赵诸城，搭梯子爬城的场面是写作的最好主题，而数千大军进入城内，作到两袖清风，秋毫无犯，不只群众有口皆碑，直使比教士也不得不高声称赞，难道说这是容易作到的吗？关于纪律教育在我们内部不是进行过严重斗争吗？而这种表现不又是人民军队的模范吗？写出来不是既有宣传意义、又有教育意义很好的主题吗？展开写兵的领域和方面，才能写出兵的全部生活来。
    解决这一问题，又不能误解为集中兵的各方面于一个创作，而必须采用多样的形式来写。因之依材取题，量体裁衣，选瓶子装酒，适应内容决定形式，宜戏剧者戏剧，宜诗歌者诗歌，宜小说者小说，能唱者唱，能画者画，能木刻者木刻，能摄影者摄影，多样的形式，多样的内容，兵的全部生活就会呈现在人们眼前了。而其主要方面，也就自然更加鲜明和突出了，并使主要方面从其他方面找到了根据。
    而在当前情况下，大力的提倡写的记录文学，又是当务之急。战斗记录，生活记录，练兵记录，生产学习记录，只要记录下来，就会是好的作品，并不用什么烘托。血汗斗争的文章比其他的文章更生动更有力，大力提倡一下，有笔在手的用笔来写，没笔在手的用口来写，一人写不出的，大家来写；提倡一下兵的记录文学，是适应紧张的战争环境，军队生活的特点，在写作上是很好方法之一。用这种方法，其形式依然是多样的。
    向兵学习，请兵批准
    兵批准了，才是写兵作品的基本标准。兵不批准，其他任何好的评价也不行，兵写兵，非兵写兵，在这一点上是一样的。特别是非兵写兵，欲达到此目的，必须认真来向兵学，要到兵营里去，战壕里去，向兵的生活学习，向兵的活动学习，要千百次的反复学习，以达到体验了兵，了解了兵，使自己在生活、语言、情绪、性格和兵一样的战斗化起来。达到非兵写兵，不是外行写内行，而是内行写内行，和兵来写兵一样的熟悉。一句话，非兵写兵要实际的“武化”一下，“武化”一下，才能写出真实的兵。这在我解放区内的写作者，并非不能的事，多年来战斗生活，大家一起出死入生，使他“武化”有了基础，现在是继续深入与提高的问题了。
    部队宣教工作者写兵，也须认真的向连队学习，更加战斗化一下，你的东西才会被广大士兵批准，受欢迎，受爱戴。四四年一分区宣传队在写兵上曾经走出的一条新道路，多少宣传员同志，和士兵一起生活，一起战斗，进行调查研究，才动笔写东西，写出来再交给士兵检查。有的在兵先生的指导之下，改了再改，改到三番五次，最后批准，才成定稿。这一从兵来到兵去，当学生、再当先生的过程中，大大的改造了作者。某同志是失败最多，结果是改造最大，又大大的亲密了文化兵和战斗兵的关系。当写他们的东西一经发表了，他们就紧记着这个作者，关心你的困难，打听你的消息。战斗结束后，以可爱的小战利品转送给你（当然作者并不是为这些礼物而写），表示对你爱戴的热情，并告以当前可供写作的珍贵材料，从而也大大的发展了写兵的作品。“党”和“一群英雄”，就是在这种过程中产生出来的，虽然还不完全是成熟的作品，但是有些是士兵大众特别欢迎的。我感到这种方法有大大发展的必要，不如此，兵就不会批准。如某同志叙述自己的画兵，经过了长期摸索，感到画兵要向兵学，找到一个全副武装的兵，画了五天，才被批准。而这一批准，才使自己了解到过去画的多是不十分像兵，正像一条铁轨八个人还是费劲才能抬起来，而自己却画的两个人抬的轻松愉快，那又如何能被批准呢？就近举例，应引起一切写兵的同志们的注意。
