　　【This newspaper, Handan, 31st dispatch】Mr. Xing Zhaotang, Vice-Speaker of the Border Region Senate, recently learned that General Hu Jingduo of the former Northwest Army led his troops in an uprising in Hengshan. He sent a telegram of congratulations, the original telegram stated:

　　General Jingduo, and to all officers and soldiers:

　　Reading your telegram, I am extremely moved and encouraged. The traitor Chiang sells out the country and curries favor with foreigners, excluding dissidents. Our Northwest People's Revolutionary Armed Forces have been almost completely eliminated. The Northwest provinces have in fact been reduced to Chiang's colonies, filled with Chiang's officials and rampant secret agents, carrying out slaughter and suppression as they please. We, the strong men of the Northwest, are neither sheep nor Adou. Rising up to survive is only natural. I hope you will rectify your subordinates, unite the people, defend national independence, strive for peace and democracy, smash Chiang's treasonous civil war, and resolutely fight to promote the revolutionary tradition of the National Pacification Army. I send this telegram to extend my congratulations. Wishing you great achievements!

　　　　　　　　　　Xing Zhaotang 敬

　　参议会副议长邢肇棠氏
    电贺胡景铎将军举义
    【本报邯郸三十一日电】边区参议会副议长邢肇棠氏，顷闻原西北军胡景铎将军率部起义横山，特电致贺，原电称：
    景铎将军并转全体将士钧鉴：
    阅读元电，感奋曷极，蒋贼卖国媚外，排斥异己，我西北人民革命武装，已被消灭殆尽。西北各省，事实上沦为蒋贼之殖民地，蒋官充斥，特务横行，屠杀镇压，为所欲为，我西北健儿，既非绵羊，又非阿斗，奋起图存，理所当然；尚希整饬所属，团结人民，为捍卫国家独立，争取和平民主，粉碎蒋贼卖国内战，发扬靖国军革命传统而坚决奋斗。谨电驰贺。顺颂勋祺！
