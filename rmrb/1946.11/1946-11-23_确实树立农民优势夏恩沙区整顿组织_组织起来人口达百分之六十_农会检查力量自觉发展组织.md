　　[Our Newspaper, Weixian, 19th Dispatch] In the Xia, En, and Sha districts, thorough work has been done to reorganize and expand organizations during the great review of emancipation. Currently, the masses organized in each village account for 40 to 60 percent of the total population. They have united more than 90 percent of the masses and established the advantage of the peasants. In Beizhan Village, En County, 135 households are organized, accounting for 85 percent of the households. The village has a total of 710 people, with 96 members of the Farmers' Association, 75 members of the Children's Corps, 74 members of the Women's Association, 15 militiamen, and 1 hired laborer, totaling 261 people, accounting for 38.2 percent of the population. This accounts for more than 66 percent of the population capable of participating in political activities (including 131 elderly people). In Gaozhuang, there are 45 households with 200 people. Currently, there are 50 Farmers' Association members, 46 Women's Association members, and 26 Children's Corps members, totaling 122 people, accounting for 61 percent of the village's total population. The work of reorganizing and expanding organizations in the Sha district, uniting more than 90 percent of the masses, is carried out as follows: (1) Breaking through the circle of hired laborers and poor peasants, and absorbing the broad masses of peasants to participate in the struggle. For example, in Dali Village, only 50 hired laborers and poor peasants participated in the struggle in the past, while the broad masses of peasants were excluded. Bad elements took the opportunity to spread rumors, saying: "Even those with a small ox will not be spared." Middle peasants and above felt terrified. Since breaking out of the narrow circle, under the slogan of "Middle and poor peasants are one family, more people mean more strength, men and women go into battle together, and jointly take revenge on the evil landlords," a large number of middle peasants poured into the organization. (2) When distributing the fruits of victory, those inside and outside the association receive the same share. In Dali Village, out of 800 people, 720 received a share of the fruits. Therefore, middle peasants also joined the Farmers' Association. In Wenxinzhuang, Xiajin, out of 301 households, after a universal distribution of the fruits of victory, the number of Farmers' Association members increased from 90 to 283. (3) In reorganizing the organization, members are guided to examine their own strength, making them realize the necessity of development and growth. Then, each member individually recruits new members. The slogan of the First District of En County is: "Don't leave a single middle peasant or well-to-do middle peasant outside." "Wash the faces of bad people like puppet soldiers, and if they become good, absorb them into the Farmers' Association." In this way, in the First and Sixth Districts, three or four hundred puppet soldiers were washed clean and joined the Farmers' Association. (4) Conducting in-depth ideological education, using individual conversations and large-scale propaganda, to make the masses realize the actual benefits of joining the organization. Experience in the Sha district proves that in villages where ideological education is well integrated with the expansion of the organization, the masses show a high degree of care for their organization. Whoever speaks disruptive words, the masses will rise up to trace the source. Everyone understands the affairs of the Farmers' Association, and the calls of the superiors can be quickly responded to.

　　确实树立农民优势夏恩沙区整顿组织
    组织起来人口达百分之六十
    农会检查力量自觉发展组织
    【本报威县十九日电】夏、恩、沙区在翻身大检查中，细致进行了整理与扩大组织的工作，现各村组织起来的群众已占到总人口百分之四十至六十。他们团结了百分之九十以上的群众，树立了农民的优势。恩县北站村一百三十五户，参加组织的户数占百分之八十五。该村共七百一十人，农会员九十六人，儿童团七十五人，妇女会七十四人，民兵十五人，雇工一人，共二百六十一人，占人口百分之三八点二。占能参加政治活动人口（包括一百三十一个老人在内）百分之六十六强。高庄共四十五户，二百口人，现有农会员五十人，妇女会员四十六人，儿童团二十六人，共一百二十二人，占全村总人口百分之六十一。沙区整理扩大组织，团结百分之九十以上群众的工作是这样进行的。（一）突破雇佃贫圈子，吸收广大农民参加斗争。如大李庄过去仅有五十个雇佃贫进行斗争，广大农民关在斗争之外，坏分子即乘机造谣说：“喂小牛户也落不住。”中农以上阶层都有恐怖情绪。自踢开狭小圈子后，在“中贫农是一家，人多力量大，男女一齐出马，共同向恶霸地主复仇”的口号下，大批中农涌入组织。（二）分果实时，会里会外一样分。大李村八百口人，分果实的就有七百二十人。中农因此也都参加了农会。夏津温辛庄三百零一户，经普遍分配果实后，农会员由九十人发展到二百八十三人。（三）在整理组织中，引导会员检查自己的力量，使其认识发展壮大的必要，然后由各会员分头进行个别吸收。恩县一区的口号是：“不让一个中农和富裕中农留在外边。”“给伪军等坏人洗脸，变好了就吸收到农会里来。”这样在一、六区就有三、四百个伪军经过洗脸擦黑，进了农会。（四）进行深入的思想教育，利用个别谈心及大会宣传，使群众体会到参加组织的实际利益。沙区经验证明：在扩大组织中结合思想教育好的村庄，群众对自己组织表现了高度爱护。谁说破坏话，群众便群起追根，农会里的事人人都明白，上级的号召很快就能得到响应。
