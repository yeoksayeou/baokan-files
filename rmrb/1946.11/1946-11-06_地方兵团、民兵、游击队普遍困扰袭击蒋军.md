Local militias, self-defense forces, and "preserve the fields" teams in liberated areas everywhere have, throughout October, repeatedly coordinated with regular troops to ambush invading Chiang Kai-shek troops, protect grain, and safeguard manpower, creating many brilliant achievements. Details are as follows:

　　**Continuous Crushing of Chiang-Puppet "Sweeps" in Wenxi, Xiaxian, and Jishan Areas**

Xinhua News Agency, Jinji-Luyu, 3rd. Chiang Kai-shek's and Yan Xishan's puppet troops have once again launched "sweeps" into the Wenxi, Xiaxian, and Jishan areas, but all were repelled by local guerrilla corps. On both sides of the Tongpu Railway, the Eighth Route Army's local corps and militia guerrillas in the Jiwangshan area of Wenxi, after crushing three major Chiang-puppet "sweeps" since mid-September, immediately seized the opportunity to counterattack, recovering vast areas and directly threatening their rear heartland, the suburbs of Wenxi and Xiaxian. Chiang Kai-shek's troops, greatly threatened, then redeployed the 84th Division and the "Love the Homeland Corps" of Wanquan, Jishan, Anyi, and other counties, along with Yan Xishan's puppet Qin Weisheng and other units, totaling 2,000 men, to invade and "sweep" again. On the 19th, the 84th Regiment of Chiang's army advanced towards Xizhang and Songjiazhuang, suffering heavy casualties from the ambush. The first battalion alone had over a hundred killed. The enemy then retreated to Xiaxian. On the 22nd, they redeployed more than 700 men from Anyi, cooperating with the Xiaxian "Love the Homeland Corps," and advanced to Weiguo Town, where they were again strongly ambushed and forced to flee into blockhouses, where they are currently besieged. More than 400 puppet troops under Qin Wansheng and others, who invaded the Jishan area, began to advance towards Bailin, west of Wenxi, on the 22nd, and were also repelled. At the same time, a part of the guerrilla corps penetrated deep behind enemy lines and captured the Xiawangyin stronghold at the northern foot of Jiwangshan in one fell swoop. An entire platoon of the Wenxi "Wenxi National Corps" was annihilated, killing eight, including the company commander, wounding seventeen, and capturing fifteen alive, seizing one machine gun, one grenade launcher, and thirteen rifles.

　　**Central Jiangsu: Capture of Many Strongholds, Seizure of a Motorboat**

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 3rd. Local armed forces and militias in Central Jiangsu, in coordination with regular troops, have achieved repeated victories. On the 25th of last month, local armed forces and militias from Taixing and Taizhou counties captured Zhangdian Town, more than twenty miles southeast of Taixian, destroying the five earthen walls and twenty-five blockhouses that Chiang Kai-shek's troops called "impregnable," and also routed Chiang Kai-shek's troops coming to reinforce from Tangwan (west of Zhangdian) and Jiangyan (northeast of Zhangdian). In this battle, 98 Chiang Kai-shek troops, including the assault company commander of the 25th Army and district chiefs, were captured alive, 54 were killed or wounded, and nine light and heavy machine guns and seventy-six rifles and carbines were seized, along with over ten thousand rounds of ammunition. On the 9th and 22nd of last month, the Jingjiang local armed forces ambushed the Chiang Kai-shek troops of the 11th Traffic Police Column as they advanced towards Baiyitang (six miles west of Jingjiang) and Chang'an, killing and capturing more than 60, rescuing more than 20 conscripted men, and seizing one American-made rocket launcher, five Thompson and carbine machine guns. On the 29th, they raided the Berlin Bridge stronghold, more than ten miles east of Jingjiang. Within twenty minutes, they killed and captured more than 30 Chiang Kai-shek troops, seized two machine guns, 21 rifles, and more than 4,000 rounds of ammunition, and rescued more than 60 hostages. Sixteen members of the "Preserve the Fields" team intercepted a Chiang Kai-shek motorboat harassing the Yangtze River coastline at Sanxugang, more than forty miles east of Jingjiang, on the 7th, capturing alive Wang Wenkui, the machine gun captain of the Chiang Kai-shek Ministry of National Defense Water Police Headquarters, and six others. A Chiang Kai-shek warship following closely behind the boat, seeing the situation was not good, hastily turned around and fled. More than 100 Chiang Kai-shek troops from Yangzhou invaded the Hanliu area on the 12th of last month, falling into a militia encirclement. Only with the assistance and cover of American-made Chiang Kai-shek aircraft did they break through and escape. The militia, returning in triumph, said: "The reactionaries even need to use airplanes to fight the militia, it's truly a joke." According to incomplete statistics, the local armed forces and militia in Central Jiangsu killed and captured more than 360 Chiang Kai-shek troops in October, seizing two artillery pieces, 17 machine guns, more than 120 rifles, and more than 14,000 rounds of ammunition.

　　**Southwestern Shandong Repels Chiang Kai-shek Troops Looting Grain**

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 3rd. Militias and work teams in Southwestern Shandong fiercely attacked Chiang Kai-shek troops looting grain. On the 13th of last month, a company of the 77th Division of Chiang Kai-shek's army, driving conscripted laborers and livestock, fled north from Yixian to Baizhuang in the second district of Lushui (Xin County, formerly eastern Yiteng County, northern Yixian) to loot grain, and was ambushed by the militia in the area. The Chiang Kai-shek troops fled in panic, and the 5,000 catties of grain and other materials they had looted were seized by the militia and returned to the masses. On the 17th, a battalion of Chiang Kai-shek's army, and on the 20th, more than 500 Chiang Kai-shek troops, came to retaliate twice, and were repelled by the militia and the mine police team. More than 1,000 troops of Wu Huawen's bandit forces entrenched in Yanzhou and the "Returning Home Corps" advanced towards Weijiamiao, twenty-five miles south of the city, to loot grain on the 19th, and were repelled by the third district militia of the county with landmines and sparrow warfare, killing and wounding seven. During the pursuit, they encountered the "Returning Home Corps" looting grain in Daogou Village, and after three hours of fierce fighting, the "Returning Home Corps" abandoned six large carts of grain, leaving twenty bodies behind, and fled back to Yanzhou. In addition, more than 70 members of the "Returning Home Corps" from Peixian secretly crossed Weishan Lake in more than ten small boats on the 13th, attempting to land and rob at Shihetou in the first district of Lincheng, but were blocked by the local work team and fled back in disarray. More than 4,000 militiamen have been assembled in Tengxian, and explosive teams have also been established in Qufu and other counties, deploying landmine arrays everywhere to strike at Chiang Kai-shek troops looting grain.

　　**Rehe**

　　**Yangcaogou, Third District of Weichang: Militia Repels Bandits Raiding the Village**

Xinhua News Agency, Ji-Re-Liao, 3rd. On the 5th of last month, twelve militiamen from Yangcaogou, Third District of Weichang, Rehe, led by Zhang Mingyu, the director of the village military affairs committee, defeated an attack by more than 300 men from the bandit Bao Shanfeng's unit, scattered in the northwestern area of Weichang and incorporated into Chiang Kai-shek's army, creating a model case of self-defense and village protection with few defeating many. The Rehe Provincial Military Affairs Committee has issued an order to commend them and called on all Rehe militiamen to learn from them. On the 5th, the bandit unit, carrying four machine guns and three small cannons, surrounded Yangcaogou in two routes at dawn. Two militiamen on village sentry and guard duty discovered them and fired their guns as a warning. The militia immediately entered the three fortresses in the village to resist. The bandits, using fierce fire to cover their advance, charged the fortresses five times, but were all repelled. The chairman and vice-chairman of the nearby village peasants' association, hearing the alarm, also came with guns and attacked the enemy on the side of the small mountain in the northeast of the village, covering the militia and the masses to break through. After four hours of fierce fighting, the bandits rushed to the fortress in the street and burned it down. Zhang Mingyu and four militiamen, who were defending the fortress, braved the smoke and fire, jumped out of the fortress, and joined other militiamen, retreating north. After the bandits occupied the fortress in the street, they busied themselves looting, and the militia seized the opportunity to charge and defeat the bandits, capturing two alive, killing and wounding more than ten, seizing two rifles, and recovering some of the items looted from the masses.
