Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, November 27th: Moscow, November 26th broadcast: Soviet commentator Yevgeny, commenting on the current situation in China, stated: "The negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have broken down, and the National Assembly played by the reactionaries does not conform to the democratic public opinion of China." Yevgeny pointed out: The Kuomintang went to great lengths to force small parties to participate in the National Assembly, split the Chinese democratic front, and isolate the CCP, but Chiang Kai-shek still gained nothing. Yevgeny continued: In his speech at the National Assembly, Chiang Kai-shek blamed the CCP for undermining democracy and peace, and portrayed the Kuomintang as a supporter of peace and democracy. However, he said this at a time when the Kuomintang army was intensifying its siege of Yan'an and various liberated areas. Therefore, the Kuomintang's desire for peace is just an unfounded empty phrase. The "actions not matching words" of the Kuomintang's leadership organs are like this. However, the Chinese Communist Party has not given up its desire for peace. The CCP representatives in Nanjing recently expressed this position to reporters from Wenhui Daily, which has been warmly supported by the Chinese people and various democratic organizations.

　　苏评论员论中国现势
    蒋记国大违背民主舆情各方拥戴中共和平立场
    【新华社延安二十七日电】莫斯科二十六日广播：苏评论员叶夫根尼评中国现势时称：“国共谈判已经破裂了，反动派扮演的国大是不合乎中国民主舆情的”。叶夫根尼指出：国民党费了九牛二虎之力，想迫使各小党派参加国大，分裂中国民主阵线，孤立中共，但蒋介石仍一无所得。叶氏继称：蒋介石在国大演说时，把破坏民主和平的责任归罪于中共，把国民党说成是和平民主的拥护者，可是他说这话时，正是国民党军加紧围攻延安及各解放区之时，故国民党的和平意愿，只不过是一句毫无根据的空话。国民党的领导机关的“行不顾言”，就是如此。可是，中国共产党并没有放弃和平愿望，中共代表近在南京向文汇报记者就表示这种立场，获得了中国人民与各民主组织的热烈拥护。
