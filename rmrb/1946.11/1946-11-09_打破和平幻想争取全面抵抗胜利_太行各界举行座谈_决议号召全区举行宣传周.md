　　Shatter Illusions of Peace, Strive for Victory in Total Resistance
    Taihang Circles Hold Symposium
    Resolution Calls on Entire Region to Hold Propaganda Week
    [This newspaper's Changzhi 31st dispatch] Taihang representatives from all walks of life held a symposium on October 30th to smash Chiang Kai-shek's peace offensive and strive for victory in total resistance. Attendees included representatives from the administrative office level agencies Li Yiqing, Wang Lianghong, and border region councillors Fan Lunwu and Zhang Tianren, who had returned from the Fourth Sub-district, and more than 30 others. Mr. Li Jingtan, a 73-year-old border region councillor from She County, also came to participate. The symposium lasted five hours. Speeches were very enthusiastic. Everyone discussed around three central issues: striving for victory in total resistance, demanding the withdrawal of US troops from China, and convening a People's Representative Conference of the Liberated Areas. Gao Wenlin, the representative of the General Labour Union, said: "The workers in the Taihang area are full of confidence in striving for peace through total resistance. We have called on all workers to increase production and compete to support the front line, and have achieved great results. When Jiaozuo was evacuated, the workers said: We swear not to be slaves of a fallen nation. Hundreds of people put down their hammers and axes, picked up weapons, and organized guerrilla detachments to deal with the stubborn army." Li Kaihun, a labor hero from She County, said: "The people's hearts are the measure of heaven, we are of one heart, and we will certainly be victorious." Hao Zhengqin, principal of the Five High Schools in She County, said: The masses recognized the true face of Chiang and the US long ago. When the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference were announced, the masses said: I am afraid that Old Chiang is unwilling to make peace and we must be vigilant! And they said: The United States is helping China to achieve "peace," but their hearts are different from ours. Now, it has indeed been proven. Chiang Kai-shek is selling out China, and the people of the Liberated Areas will not allow it. Mr. Hao Hairu, an old border region councillor, said: Japan is a true villain, and the United States is a false gentleman. A false gentleman is even more hateful than a true villain. We should appeal to the United Nations to condemn the atrocities of the US military and demand the withdrawal of US troops. We should publicize Chiang Kai-shek's crimes of betraying the country to Chiang Kai-shek's officers and soldiers. In the past, when Yuan Shikai sold out the country, Cai E launched an uprising in Yunnan, and the whole country responded. As long as we get through to the minds of Chiang's army officers and soldiers, more of them will automatically lay down their weapons. Finally, a unanimous resolution was made: (1) To send a telegram to the United Nations General Assembly demanding the withdrawal of US troops from China. (2) To send a telegram to the Preparatory Committee for the People's Representative Conference of the Liberated Areas in Yan'an, demanding the convening of the People's Representative Conference of the Liberated Areas. (3) To call on the entire region to hold a propaganda week to smash Chiang Kai-shek's peace offensive and strive for victory in total resistance, to extensively and deeply expose Chiang Kai-shek's peace offensive, and to shatter any illusions about Chiang Kai-shek's peace. To mobilize all forces and strive for victory in total resistance with practical work.

　　打破和平幻想争取全面抵抗胜利
    太行各界举行座谈
    决议号召全区举行宣传周
    【本报长治三十一日电】太行各界代表，于十月卅日举行粉碎蒋介石和平攻势，争取全面抵抗胜利座谈会。出席者有行署级各机关代表李一清、王量宏及自四分区归来的边区参议员范沦五、张天仁等三十余人。七十三岁高龄的涉县籍边区参议员李井田老先生也赶来参加。座谈历五小时。发言非常热烈。大家都围绕着三个中心问题讨论，争取全面抵抗胜利，要求美军退出中国及召开解放区人民代表会议。总工会代表高文林说：“太行区的工人，对于以全面抵抗争取和平充满信心。我们曾号召全体工友，增产竞赛支援前线，现已获得巨大成绩。焦作撤退时，工友们说：誓死不做亡国奴。数百人放下锤斧，拿起武器，组织游击大队和顽军周旋。”涉县劳动英雄李开勋说：“人民比天心，我们是一条心，也一定能胜利。”涉县五高校长郝政钦说：群众对于蒋美的真面目是很早就认识的。当政协决议公布的时候，群众就说：恐怕老蒋不愿和平，要谨防！又说：美国帮助中国搞“和平”，但内心和咱们不一样。现在，果然证明了。蒋介石出卖中国，解放区老百姓是不让的。边区参议员郝海如老先生说：日本是真小人，美国是假君子、假君子比真小人还可恶。我们应向联合国控诉美军暴行，要求美军撤退。向蒋介石官兵宣传蒋介石卖国罪行。以前袁世凯卖国，蔡锷云南起义，全国响应。我们只要打通蒋军官兵思想，他们自动放下武器的定会更多起来。最后一致决议：（一）致电联合国大会，要求美军退出中国。（二）致电延安解放区人民代表会议筹委会，要求召开解放区人民代表会议。（三）号召全区，举行粉碎蒋介石和平攻势，争取全面抵抗胜利宣传周，广泛深入揭发蒋介石的和平攻势，打破对蒋介石的任何和平幻想。动员一切力量，用实际工作争取全面抵抗的胜利。
