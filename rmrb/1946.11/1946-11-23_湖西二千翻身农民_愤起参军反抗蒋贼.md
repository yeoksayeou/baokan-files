　　Lake West Two Thousand Emancipated Peasants
    Angrily Enlist to Resist Chiang Kai-shek Bandits
    [Report from the Frontline Reporter Group of Jilu Yu on the 16th] In the Lake West (Third Sub-district) area of Jilu Yu, occupied by Chiang's army, more than 9,000 liberated area compatriots in Feng, Pei, Jin, and Shan counties were brutally killed in a month and a half. This has aroused great anger among the local masses. Now, more than 2,600 emancipated peasants and militiamen have formed a powerful guerrilla corps, vowing to avenge the dead. Since Chiang's army invaded Lake West in late September, the two million people in the area have suffered an unprecedented catastrophe even worse than the Japanese invaders after the victory of the eight-year war of resistance. On October 12, Chiang's army, with two main corps, began repeated looting and mass killings of the people on both sides of the Jin (xiang) and Shan (county) highways. In Dengjiao Village, Shan-Yu County, Wang Maolin and his son were buried alive in a pit by the Chiang army's "Homecoming Corps." The Chiang army also drove the captured masses into the city for collective massacres. According to incomplete statistics, more than 400 compatriots were brutally killed by Chiang's army in Shan-Yu, Jinxiang, Shan County, Chengwu, Junan and other counties. In Feng and Pei counties, the number even reached 6,000. In Pei County, there were even cases of entire families being wiped out. The Chiang army's deceptive propaganda such as "lenient policies" has been exposed by its brutal acts that surpassed the Japanese invaders. The people of Lake West are determined to avenge the dead at all costs. More than 2,600 emancipated masses and militiamen in the area have unanimously risen up to join the army. The Lake West District Guerrilla Corps has been formed. The leaders of the guerrilla corps are all mass leaders in the Lake West area who have won the support of the people during the War of Resistance.

    【本报冀鲁豫前线记者团十六日电】侵占冀鲁豫湖西（三分区）之蒋军，一个半月内，惨杀丰、沛、金、单等县解放区同胞达九千之多。激起当地群众极大愤怒，顷有二千六百余翻身农民及民兵，已组成强大游击兵团，誓为死者复仇。蒋军自九月下旬侵占湖西后，该区二百万人民，于抗战八年胜利之后，又遭受甚于日寇的空前浩劫。十月十二日，蒋军以两个主力兵团、开始在金（乡）、单（县）公路两侧，反复进行抢掠，大量捕杀群众。单虞县邓窖村，王茂林父子两人，被蒋军还乡团活埋在一个坑里。蒋军更将捕捉的群众，赶至城内，进行集体大屠杀。据不完全统计：单虞、金乡、单县、城武、巨南等县被蒋军惨杀的同胞，均在四百人以上。丰、沛两县竟达六千之众。沛县更有全家被杀绝者。蒋军的“宽大政策”等欺骗宣传，已为其赛过日寇的残暴行为所揭破。湖西人民齐下决心，誓死为死难者复仇。该区二千六百余翻身群众及民兵，一致奋起参军。已组成湖西区游击兵团。该游击兵团领导者，均为抗战期间湖西区深得人民拥护的群众领袖。
