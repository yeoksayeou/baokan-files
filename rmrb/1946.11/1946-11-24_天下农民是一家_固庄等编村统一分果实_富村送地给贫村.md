　　Farmers All Over the World Are One Family
　　Gu Zhuang and Other Villages Combine for Unified Distribution of Fruits
　　Rich Villages Give Land to Poor Villages

　　[Our Newspaper Changzhi News] In the recent distribution of fruits, Qianzhuang Village in Yushe and others paid attention to leveling the playing field, compensating for deficiencies, and taking care of particularly poor natural villages. This time, the liquidation movement in the village was carried out by natural villages. At the beginning of the distribution of fruits, many farmers advocated that each natural village should distribute its own fruits. However, Qianzhuang natural village was particularly poor. With the fruits recovered by their own village, the farmers still could not turn themselves around. After discovering this problem, the village cadres immediately raised it for discussion at the village farmers' association. Activist Huang Decheng advocated unified distribution by village, saying, "We often say that farmers all over the world are one family, and now we should rise up together." After deliberation and discussion, everyone agreed with Huang Decheng's opinion. Chiyu natural village voluntarily gave Qianzhuang 270 silver dollars and 50 pieces of clothing. Guzhuang natural village gave 20 mu of land, an orchard, and 50 jin of sesame oil, and specially gave two sets of quilts and bedding to the honorary servicemen in Qianzhuang. As a result, not only was the distribution of fruits fair and reasonable, but the farmers in the whole village became even more closely united. (Huai Bao, Sheng Gui)

　　天下农民是一家
    固庄等编村统一分果实
    富村送地给贫村
    【本报长治讯】榆社前庄村等最近在分配果实时，注意了填平补齐，照顾了特别贫苦的自然村。该村这次清算运动是以自然村进行的，在分配果实之初，许多农民主张各自然村分各自的果实，但前庄自然村是特别贫苦的，以其本村要回的果实，农民还翻不了身，村干部发现这个问题后，即在全村农会提出讨论，积极分子黄得成主张以编村统一分，他说：“咱们常说天下农民是一家，现在就应当共同翻身。”经酝酿讨论，大家都同意黄得成的意见，赤峪自然村自动让给前庄银洋二百七十元，衣服五十件，固庄自然村让地二十亩，果树园一座，香油五十斤，特别拿被、褥两套送给前庄荣誉军人。这一来，不但果实分配做到了公平合理，全村农民亦更加亲密团结。（怀保、生桂）
