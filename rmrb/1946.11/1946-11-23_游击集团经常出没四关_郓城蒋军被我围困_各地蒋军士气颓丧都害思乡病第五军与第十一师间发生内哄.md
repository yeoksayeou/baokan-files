[Report from our Frontline Correspondent Group on the 19th] Jiang's troops, who occupied Yuncheng last month on the 24th, are now surrounded by our guerrilla groups and militia. Our mass armed forces frequently appear in the four gates of Yuncheng. The 75th Division of Jiang's troops garrisoning the city is extremely terrified, and constantly bombard villages and towns in the suburbs at night to "boost their courage." During the day, they divide into groups to loot and plunder to fill their bellies. Since the "ceasefire order" of Chiang Kai-shek "came into effect" ten days ago, they have become even more frenzied, and the self-defense guerrilla activities of the masses in the suburbs have become more and more fierce. On the 15th, a peasant guerrilla team of ours routed more than 200 Jiang troops who invaded Xu Guanzhuang (4.8 li from the city), killing and wounding more than 20 Jiang troops (including a intelligence captain). In addition, three soldiers of the American-equipped 11th Division, 31st Regiment, and three Jiang's district chiefs and below were captured. According to the prisoners, the morale of Jiang's troops garrisoning Yuncheng is extremely low, full of homesickness, and there are contradictions among the officers, with the saying: "Fighting depends on the rank and file, making money depends on Whampoa."

[Report from our Correspondent Group on the 21st] After the Jiang's troops' direct lineage, the American-equipped 11th Division, had a regiment annihilated by us in Zhangfengji, internal strife occurred in the Fifth Army of Jiang’s "Expeditionary Force." The soldiers were tired of war and afraid of death, and unwilling to be foreign slaves. According to Zhang Dixuan, a soldier of the division who was captured by our troops active in northern Yuncheng (city), the 11th Division was originally under the command of the Fifth Army. After losing eight mountain guns and having a regiment annihilated in Zhangfengji, the division blamed the Fifth Army for the wrong command and failure to provide reinforcements. The internal strife lawsuit went straight to the Military Commission of Jiang's troops. Recently, Chiang Kai-shek has telegraphed the division to fight alone. It is also said that after the Battle of Zhangfengji, the morale of the division was unprecedentedly depressed, and everyone believed that the "Communist troops" were not easy to fight. The middle and lower-ranking officers felt that it was meaningless to fight a civil war. The soldiers are tired of war, believing that they will inevitably face "five deaths" sooner or later – being killed by the Eighth Route Army, being exhausted by construction work, dying of illness due to poor living conditions, dying of stomach pain from eating dough lumps, and being afraid of dispersing and being squeezed to death by living in one place. Now, the following public opinion is circulating: wearing American clothes, firing American cannons, the officials want to be Americanized officials, but the soldiers are unwilling to be "foreign slave soldiers," and they all hope to be captured by the Eighth Route Army sooner.

　　游击集团经常出没四关
    郓城蒋军被我围困
    各地蒋军士气颓丧都害思乡病第五军与第十一师间发生内哄
    【本报前线记者团十九日电】上月廿四日侵占郓城之蒋军，现已在我游击集团与民兵包围中。郓城四关经常有我群众武装出没，城内蒋军七十五师守备部队极为恐慌，入夜不断炮轰城郊村镇以“壮胆”。白天即分股窜扰抢掠，以果其腹。蒋介石“停战令”“生效”之十日以来，愈益疯狂，城郊群众的自卫游击活动已愈益猛烈。十五日我某农民游击队将自城出犯徐官屯（城四八里）二百余蒋军击溃，毙伤蒋军二十余名（内有谍报队长一名）。另俘美械十一师三十一团士兵三名及蒋记区长以下三名。据俘虏称：守备郓城蒋军士气极颓丧，充满着一片思乡病，军官中并矛盾百出，有所谓：“打仗靠行伍，发财由黄埔”的话。
    【本报记者团二十一日电】蒋军嫡系美械第十一师，在张凤集被我消灭一个团后，蒋“远征军”第五军发生内哄，士兵厌战怕死，不甘当洋奴。据被我活动于郓（城）北部队俘虏之该师战士张第轩称：第十一师原受第五军指挥，在张凤集丢去八门山炮，被消灭一个团后，该师责备第五军指挥错误，不予增援。内哄官司直打至蒋军军事委员会。最近蒋介石已电令该师单独作战。又称：张凤集战斗后，该师士气空前消沉，咸认“共军”并不易打，中下军官更感到打内战没意思。士兵厌战，认为早晚难免“五死”——被八路军打死，作工事累死，生活不好病死，吃面圪瘩肚子疼死，不敢分散、住在一处挤死。现在公开流传着这样的舆论：穿着美国衣，打的美国炮，当官的想当美化官，当兵的可不愿当“洋奴兵”，都盼望早当八路军的俘虏。
