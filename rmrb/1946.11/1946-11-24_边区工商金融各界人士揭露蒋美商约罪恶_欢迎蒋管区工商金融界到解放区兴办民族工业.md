　　[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] This reporter has interviewed prominent figures in industry, including Mr. Xu Dabeng, Chairman of Limin Coal Mine, Mr. Hu Zhuxuan, Manager of Ruihua Bank, and Mr. Zhang Guiyin, Chairman of the Taihang Businessmen's Association, over the past few days to inquire about their opinions on the "Sino-American Commercial Treaty." Chairman Xu said: "This is a treaty of national betrayal, legalizing the American reactionaries' plan to eradicate China's national industry, and will plunge the lives of the Chinese people into unimaginable misery." Manager Hu said: "According to the interpretation of Article 19, Section 3 of the 'Sino-American Commercial Treaty,' American banknotes and government securities can circulate in the Chinese market. This means that China's finance will become completely subservient to American financial groups, entirely at the disposal of the Americans. As a banker, I call on the national banking community to rise up and oppose this traitorous act." Chairman Zhang of the Businessmen's Association said: "China's industry and commerce have been collapsing one after another under the impact of American goods. If Americans are allowed to directly operate industries and businesses in China in the future, China will become a complete colony. The so-called 'equality and mutual benefit' is just an empty term, merely shameless deception." They unanimously stated that the industrial, commercial, and financial sectors in the Liberated Areas warmly welcome people from the industrial, commercial, and financial circles in the Kuomintang-controlled areas to come to the Liberated Areas to establish national industries to fight against the economic aggression of American imperialism.

　　边区工商金融各界人士揭露蒋美商约罪恶
    欢迎蒋管区工商金融界到解放区兴办民族工业
    【本报特讯】本报记者连日分访工业界巨子利民煤矿董事长徐达本、瑞华银行经理胡竹轩、太行商联会主席张贵银叩询对“中美商约”的意见。徐董事长说：“这是一种亡国条约，使美国反动派灭绝中国民族工业的计划合法化，将使中国人民生活陷于不可思议的悲惨境地。”胡经理说：“照‘中美商约’第十九条第三款的解释，美国纸币及政府证券可以在中国市场流通，这就是说中国的金融完全变成美国财阀的附庸，完全听从美国人摆布。我以一个办银行人的资格，呼吁全国银行界起来反对这种卖国行为。”商联会张主席说：“中国的工商业在美货打击下，已纷纷倒闭，以后再让美国人在中国直接经营工商业，中国就成了彻头彻尾的殖民地，所谓‘平等互惠’空名词，只是无耻的欺骗。”他们一致表示：解放区工、商、金融各业热烈欢迎国民党统治区的工商各界到解放区来兴办民族工业以与美国帝国主义的经济侵略相抗争。
