    Men Farm, Women Weave, Annual Grain Increase of 30,000 Jin
    Waisong Village Prospers Through Mutual Aid Production
    [This newspaper's Weixian 16th dispatch] After two years of mutual aid production by poor peasants in Waisson Village, Pingxiang, men farming and women weaving, it was concluded this autumn that the total grain production had increased by more than 30,000 jin for the whole year, and five heads of livestock were added. The poor peasants have completely risen to become middle peasants. This spring, the village originally had 69 households (2 rich peasant households, 52 middle peasant households, and 15 poor peasant households). Except for the two rich peasant households and two widowed middle peasant households, the rest all participated in mutual aid. A total of ten agricultural mutual aid groups were organized, including 56 men; two weaving groups, including 10 women. From spring plowing to autumn harvest, due to mutual aid, the whole village saved a total of 9,600 workdays (saving 40 workdays per day), reclaimed 60 mu of wasteland, and increased grain production by more than 5,400 jin. Smoked 10,000 jin of small salt, equivalent to more than 5,000 jin of grain. Hoeing and harrowing were done one more time each, and each mu of land yielded 30 jin more, for a total increase of 20,000 jin. There are now no more poor peasant households.
