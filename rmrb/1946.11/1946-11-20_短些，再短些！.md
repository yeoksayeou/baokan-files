Shorter, Shorter!
Qiao Mu

Speaking briefly and succinctly is not easy for those of us touched by the "long wind." When I recall what I have said and reread what I have written, what saddens me most is that it is neither concise nor essential. The old saying, "It is easy to go from frugality to extravagance, but difficult to go from extravagance to frugality," is indeed true. The Yan'an meeting against Party stereotypes on February 8, 1942, was originally called the "Compression Meeting." Four and a half years have passed, and compression has not yet succeeded. What Lu Xun said then – "After finishing writing, read it at least twice, and try to delete any unnecessary words, sentences, and paragraphs without regret" – remains our alarm bell.

Our short speeches depend on the chairmen of meetings, and our short articles depend on the editors of the *Liberation Daily*. Therefore, I propose to the *Liberation Daily* the following: (1) Four-fifths of the news should be between one hundred and four hundred characters (of which at least one-fifth should be able to summarize the whole picture of a situation, a place, a problem, or an issue at a time); (2) Four-fifths of the correspondence and supplement articles should be between four hundred and one thousand characters; (3) Four-fifths of research papers, special articles, etc., should be between four hundred and two thousand characters. There is no need to list the reasons. This is of great benefit to both readers and authors, and it is a great liberation; more than four-fifths of the authors originally liked to write short pieces, but now the terrain is occupied by a few big landlords.

Since I am submitting a manuscript to the supplement, let me talk about our supplement. It is particularly large in size and has very few articles compared to others of its kind in the country. I have seen that other "large newspapers" in the liberated areas also follow this pattern, and sometimes they are even more extravagant, with only two or three large titles on a page, or even devoting several entire pages to a "semi-literary" work. Those places have separate magazines, so the style of the Yan'an supplement is not due to the lack of magazines. I think we should admit that the mass viewpoint is too weak, or admit that we don't know how to write for newspapers, have not figured out the difference between writing for tens or hundreds of thousands of people every day and writing for thousands of people every week or month, and have not remembered that the longer one writes, the fewer people will read it. The *Shen Bao's* "Free Talk" edited by Li Lieven may not be a good supplement for the masses, and its small items are already too few, but it still publishes twice as many things as we do with half the space, most of which (including Lu Xun's great short essays) are only a few hundred words long. We should be more accessible, more lively, and richer in content, and, with exceptions, the average number of words per article should be even less. Let us have such a supplement, which does not have too many dispensable "intellectual pronouncements" appearing under various names, as Lenin called them, but crams tens of thousands of characters on a page every day with dozens of articles and letters from various authors and readers, conveying every aspect of life and struggle in a practical and compact way, conveying the noise of the masses like a thriving garden!

### 短些，再短些！

    短些，再短些！
    乔木
    话说得短，说得简要，对我们沾了“长风”的不是易事。我回想自己说过的话，重看写过的什么，每次先叫我难过的就是既不简又不要，想起“由俭入奢易，由奢入俭难”这老格言，果然不错。一九四二年二月八日延安反对党八股的大会原先就叫“压缩大会”，四年半了，压缩尚未成功。那次引的鲁迅的话：“写完后至少看两遍，竭力将可有可无的字、句、段删去，毫不可惜”，依然是我们的警钟。
    我们的说话短靠开会的主席，作文短就靠解放报的编辑。因此，我向解放报提个议：（一）新闻要五分之四是一百字到四百字的（内中至少五分之一还要能概括一时一地一种情况一项问题的全貌）；（二）通讯和副刊稿件五分之四是四百字到一千字；（三）研究论文、专文等等五分之四四百字到两千字。道理无需列举。这对读者作者都有大好处，都是大解放；五分之四以上的作者原也是爱写短的，现在是地盘叫少数大地主霸占着吧了。
    我这是投稿给副刊，就说说我们的副刊吧。它在全国的同类中篇幅特大而篇数特少。我看过的其他解放区“大报”也多学这个样，有时还更阔气些，一版只见两三个大题，甚至花几整版登一篇“半文学的”作品。那些地方另有杂志，可见延安副刊的派头并不由于没有杂志。我想我们应该承认群众观点太弱，或者承认我们还不会给报纸写作，没弄清每天写给几十几百万人跟每周每月写给几千人的分别，没记着写得愈长看的人就愈少。黎烈文编的申报“自由谈”未必是给大众看的好副刊，它的小杂件已经太少了，但还是以我们一半的篇幅登了双倍的东西，其中大部分（包括鲁迅那些伟大的小论文）不过几百字长短。我们按说得更通俗，更活泼，更丰富，除了例外，每篇平均字数得更少。让我们有这样的副刊吧，它没有太多的可有可无的以各种名义出现的列宁所谓“智识分子的言论”，可是每天万把字的版面上挤满各种作者读者各种内容形式的几十篇稿件信件，切实而紧凑地传达着生活和战斗的各个侧面，传达着群众的嘈杂好比生意旺盛的花园一般！
