(Special dispatch from this newspaper) The masses in Handan, Wu'an, Linxian and other places along the Pinghan Railway Line are actively preparing for war. Merchants and residents in the county towns and the liberated masses have transferred most of their grain and materials to safe areas. Tens of thousands of militia in the three counties have all shouldered their weapons, and more than one hundred blasting teams have been organized. The first batch of more than 20,000 iron and stone landmines have been prepared to deal a head-on blow to the invading Chiang troops. Since the Central Bureau of the CCP Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu region convened a meeting of cadres from the counties along the Pinghan Railway Line on the 16th of last month to inspect the mass war preparation work, Handan, Wu'an, Linxian and other counties immediately organized county and city headquarters, convened war preparation conferences, called on the masses to mobilize urgently, to thoroughly complete the war preparation work, to implement the "empty villages and clear fields" policy along the main roads and villages, to organize blasting campaigns, and to prepare to trap and starve the Chiang Kai-shek’s puppet troops, and to blow up and kill the enemy when they arrive. After more than ten days of intense war preparation work, the masses in each county have now arranged burial graves for Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary faction. The merchants and residents in the county towns of Handan, Wu'an, and Linxian have transferred most of their grain and materials to safe areas. Young men and women in Linxian formed several transportation brigades, and within eight days, transported 8 million catties of public and private grain and materials. Merchants and residents in Wu'an organized more than 200 head of livestock to help transport goods. In addition to leaving a small portion of goods for normal business operations, each business also opened a second business or outlet in a safe area and began operations. Handan City also established a guerrilla brigade, preparing to cooperate with more than a thousand city militiamen to attack the enemy when Chiang's troops invade. In Linxian, in addition to establishing command posts in the county, districts, and villages, four more command posts were added as strong groups for carrying out extensive guerrilla warfare in the future. The county's 11,000 militia members are each equipped with a steel gun, as well as several machine guns and mortars. Each district has a militia backbone company and a mobile blasting team. Every village in the Linqi District has a blasting team, and has now received 10,000 landmines, and is currently producing them in large quantities. After half a month of martial arts training and blasting exercises, the 10,000 militia members in Wu'an have organized the core institutions of the militia - county cadre teams, district cadre teams, base point joint defense, and combat command posts at all levels, as well as rotating battle teams for launching attacks in turn. A large number of merchants and residents, in order to protect their lives and property, also automatically organized self-defense forces and militias, and selected capable militiamen to learn blasting. The people of all counties unanimously stated that they are determined to fight the invading Chiang Kai-shek’s puppet troops to the end. They said: "We must never let Chiang Kai-shek put a big stone slab on our heads again." Many militiamen clenched their fists and said firmly: "We defeated the Japanese devils in the past, and today we also have the confidence to defeat Chiang Kai-shek's attack. The world does not belong to the Chiang family, but to us common people." A responsible comrade of the Handan Municipal Party Committee also told reporters: If Chiang's troops dare to invade Handan, what Chiang's troops will get is a grave to bury themselves in, and only a waste of the lives of countless innocent soldiers.

　　平汉沿线安排下蒋军坟墓
    邯郸等县积极备战
    数万民兵扛起武器备好地雷两万枚
    【本报特讯】平汉沿线邯郸、武安、林县等地群众积极备战。各县城关商民及翻身后的群众，已将粮食物资大部转移到安全地带；三县数万民兵已全部扛起武器，并组织百余爆炸组，第一批准备好铁石地雷两万余枚，准备予进犯蒋军以迎头痛击。自上月十六日中共晋冀鲁豫中央局召集平汉沿线各县干部会议，检查群众备战工作后，邯郸、武安、林县等县均立即组织县市指挥部，召开了备战大会，号召群众紧急动员起来，把备战工作彻底完成，沿大道村镇实行空室清野，组织爆炸运动，准备当敌人到来时，困饿蒋伪，炸死敌人。经过十余天的紧张备战工作，现在各县群众已给蒋介石反动派安排好了葬身的坟墓。邯郸、武安、林县城关各商号和市民已将粮食物资大部转移到安全地区。林县青壮年男女组成若干运输大队，于八日内，运出公私粮食及物资八百万斤；武安商民则组织了二百多头牲口帮助转运货物。各商号除留下一小部分货物照常营业外，并已在安全地区开设第二商号或门市部，开始营业。邯郸市并成立了游击大队，准备在蒋军进犯时，配合全市千余民兵，打击敌人。林县除县区村都成立了指挥部，又增设四个指挥所，作为将来开展广泛游击战争的坚强集团。全县一万×千民兵，每人都有钢枪一支，并配备机枪××挺、迫击炮多门。每个区均设民兵基干连及飞行爆炸组。临淇区每村都有爆炸组，现已领到地雷万枚，并正在大量赶造中。武安×万民兵经过半月来的练武和演习爆炸，已组织民兵的核心机构——县干队、区干队，基点联防及各级战斗指挥部，以及轮番出击的轮战队。大批商民为了保卫自己的生命财产，也自动组织了自卫队和民兵，并选出精干的民兵去学习爆炸。各县民众均一致表示，坚决要与蒋伪进犯军拚到底，他们说：“我们决不能让蒋贼再把大石板压在我们的头上。”许多民兵则磨拳擦掌坚定地说：“我们过去打败了日本鬼子，今天也有信心打败蒋贼的进攻。天下不是蒋家的，是咱们老百姓的。”邯郸市委负责同志亦对记者表示：如果蒋军胆敢进犯邯郸，那蒋军得到的将是一座埋葬他们自己的坟墓，徒断送无数无辜的士兵生命而已。
