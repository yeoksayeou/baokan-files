    Taihang Xiangyuan and Ten Other Counties Reduce People's Burden
    Exemption of Local Grain Levies
    Savings in Production to Solve Expenditure Difficulties
    [Our newspaper Changzhi News] In order to reduce the burden on the people and support the self-defense front line for a long time, Xiangyuan and ten other counties in the Taihang Second Special District have exempted local grain and local levies. The total amount of local grain and local levies is 5,224,500 jin of millet and 32,940,000 yuan of border currency. In the past, all administrative expenses of the counties relied on this for expenditure, and were collected once a year along with public grain (divided into border grain and local grain) and public funds (divided into border funds and local funds). In the future, local administrative expenses of the counties will either be simplified and saved, or solved through production. We have now found the specific methods as follows: 1. Stop all unnecessary expenses. For example, Licheng has stopped paying construction fees, which account for 23% of the total local funds. 2. Starting from small things, consolidate scattered public property and gather small income into large income, overcoming the past phenomenon of relying solely on collection. This year, Yushe collected old bricks, which made up for the construction costs. 3. Under the principle of promoting economic prosperity and developing mass production, collect a certain amount of taxes, such as the livestock and grain transaction tax in Xiangyuan, which accounts for half of the entire local income. 4. Prevent the wasteful phenomenon of concealing public goods and satisfying private interests, such as the poor phenomenon of a certain district office in Xiyang privately borrowing 40 shi of public grain to make up for overspending on vegetable funds. 5. Organize the masses to engage in comprehensive production to solve the problem of public grain and people's food, such as in Jingdi, a village in Pingshun, where non-agricultural income in ten months exceeded the entire year's agricultural income by one time.

    太行襄垣等十县减轻民负
    免征地方粮款
    节约生产解决开支困难
    【本报长治讯】为减轻人民负担，长期支援自卫前线，太行二专区襄垣等十县免征地方粮、地方款。是项地粮地款合计五百二十二万四千五百斤小米及三千二百九十四万元边币。过去各县一切政费均赖以开支，每年随公粮（分边粮地粮）、公款（分边款地款）一次征收。今后各县地方政费开支，或从简节约，或生产解决。今觅得其具体办法如次：一、停止一切不必要的开支。如黎城占全部地款费百分之二十三的建设费，即已停支。二、从点滴着眼，整顿零碎公产，集小收入为大收入，克服过去单凭征收现象。榆社今年收拾旧砖，补足了建筑费用。三、在繁荣经济，发展群众生产原则下，征收一定数量的税款，如襄垣牲畜及粮食交易税收即占整个地方收入一半。四、防止瞒公不满私的浪费现象，如昔阳××区公所私借公粮四十石以弥补超支菜金等不良现象。五、组织群众全面生产来解决公粮与民食如平顺井底一个行政村，十个月副业收入即超过全年农业收入的一倍。
