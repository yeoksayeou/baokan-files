    At the donation rally, turned-over woman You Aiqin, holding a bright and beautiful comfort bag embroidered with the words "Comfort Bag" on the front and "Presented by You Aiqin to the Eighth Route Army Serving the People" on the back, squeezed through the crowd to give it to the village chief on the stage. She said, "This bag contains fifty dollars, which I got from my mother; a green pen sleeve with floral embroidery, and a large handful of red dates, which are for the comrades fighting at the front!" Before she could finish, applause thundered. Then she added, "My family used to be very poor. When I was eight or nine years old, I went to the fields to pick up firewood and glean crops every day. After the mass struggle in our village, I also turned over. Now my family has no worries about food and clothing, and I can go to school and learn to read and write. All this is thanks to Chairman Mao and the Eighth Route Army for giving us good days. Didn't the village chief say that Chiang Kai-shek has occupied many places in the Liberated Areas? We must all mobilize, and contribute whatever we have. The Eighth Route Army treats me so well, I can't do anything else, village chief, please find a way to take this for me!"

    慰问袋

    在献金大会上，翻身妇女尤爱琴拿着上面绣着“慰问袋”三字、背面绣着“为人民服务的八路军——尤爱琴赠”又鲜艳又漂亮的慰问袋，挤在人们的面前，给了台上的村长。她说：“我这袋里面装着五十块钱，是和我母亲要的；一个花绣的绿笔套，还有一大把红枣，这是送给前方打仗的同志们的！”她还没说完，掌声就雷动起来了。接着她又说：“以前俺家很穷。在我八九岁时，天天到地里拾柴火，拾庄稼。咱村群众斗争后，我也翻了身。现在我家不愁吃喝，我还能上学念书、识字。这都是毛主席八路军给咱的好日子。村长不是说了吗？蒋介石侵占了解放区很多地方，咱们大家都要动员起来，有什么拿什么。八路军待我这样好，我不会做别的，村长，你想法把这个替我捎了去吧！”
