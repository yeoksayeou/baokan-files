    Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 10th (delayed dispatch) - Mr. Yan Baohang, member of the Northeast Administrative Committee and Chairman of Liaobei Province, who was seriously injured in the Xiaguan Incident in Nanjing in June, along with Mr. Xu Shouxuan, member of the Northeast Administrative Committee, and Mr. Yuan Dongfang of Baoye Family, arrived in Yanji on the 6th en route to Harbin. On that day, Zhou Baozhong, Chairman of Jilin Province, and people from all walks of life in Yanji held a grand welcoming ceremony. Mr. Yan denounced Chiang Kai-shek's unilateral convening of the Kuomintang-dominated National Assembly as tearing up the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and determined to split and antagonize the entire people. In narrating the efforts of the Northeast groups in Chongqing to seek peace in the Northeast, Mr. Yan said: On one occasion when the Northeast groups met with representatives from all parties, Old Mr. ＠ raised his glass and said angrily to Shao Lizi, the representative of the Kuomintang: "We, the people of the Northeast, must ask you to convey to Mr. Chiang Kai-shek our opinion that the Northeast issue should be resolved peacefully. Let's have a drink, this is the blood and tears of our people in the Northeast!" But these efforts ultimately failed. Mr. Yan expressed his excitement at returning to the Northeast to serve the people of his hometown after overcoming numerous obstacles, and called on the people of the Northeast to mobilize and contribute everything to the cause of democracy and peace in China.

    阎宝航氏经延吉赴哈
    斥蒋介石擅开国大与民为敌
    【新华社东北十日电】（迟到）东北行政委员兼辽北省主席，曾在六月南京下关惨案中受重伤之阎宝航、东北行政委员徐寿轩两先生，及宝业家袁东舫等一行，六日于赴哈途中转道抵延吉。是日吉林省周保中主席和延吉各界特召开盛大欢迎会。阎氏指斥蒋介石单独召开一党包办的国民大会是撕毁政协决议，决心分裂与全体人民为敌。阎氏在叙述重庆东北团体奔走东北和平时称：某次东北团体会见各方代表时，＠武老先生就举起酒杯向国民党代表邵力子愤慨的说：“我们东北人民要求和平解决东北问题的意见，一定要请你转告蒋介石先生。来喝一杯吧，这是我们东北人民的血和泪！”但这些奔走努力，结果是落空了。阎氏这次对历尽险阻回到东北为桑梓人民服务表示兴奋，并号召东北人民动员起来，为中国的民主和平事业贡献一切力量。
