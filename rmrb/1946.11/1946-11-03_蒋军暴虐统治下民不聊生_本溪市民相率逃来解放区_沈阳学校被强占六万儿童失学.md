　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 28th: Under the brutal rule of Chiang Kai-shek's army, the people of Benxi City are unable to live, and the number fleeing to the liberated areas is increasing daily. From the 11th to the 13th of this month alone, as many as four families moved to the first district of Benxi County in the liberated area. Mr. Fu Huisheng, one of the newly arrived, said: "Life in Benxi City is truly unbearable. Many people want to go to the liberated areas, but there are too many checkpoints manned by Chiang Kai-shek's troops, making it difficult to get out. However, the pressure is too great, and even with many checkpoints, people will still find a way to leave." It is said that prices in Benxi City have risen 29 times compared to before, and are three to ten times higher than prices in the liberated areas. Comparing Benxi prices on September 11th with those in nearby liberated areas, Benxi sorghum costs 600 yuan per jin (approximately 0.5 kg), six times higher than in the liberated area. Pork is almost three times as expensive, and the difference for chickens is even greater, as much as five times higher, because the chickens of the Benxi people have all been eaten by Chiang Kai-shek's army.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 28th: Shenyang dispatch: The total number of out-of-school children in Shenyang City has reached more than 60,000. The majority of school buildings have been forcibly occupied by the army and cannot be opened for classes. Those that have勉强勉强 opened for classes mostly lack doors and windows, with hundreds of students squeezed into one classroom, three students per stool, and six students per small table. Elementary school teachers can only receive a maximum monthly salary of just over 1,000 yuan in circulating currency, making it impossible to maintain a living. Many are seeking refuge in the liberated areas or changing professions. Some schools have implemented a "half-day school system" due to a shortage of teachers. All two hundred teachers from the fifteen provincial middle schools in Shenyang went on strike on the 18th of last month, demanding that the authorities improve their treatment, and they received the full support of 15,000 students. University education in Shenyang only has a "University Preparatory Class" at present, forcing "puppet high school students" to undergo two years of "preparatory" training first. Many young students are either unable to enroll or are unwilling to receive the Kuomintang's "training" and are still wandering the streets.

　　蒋军暴虐统治下民不聊生
    本溪市民相率逃来解放区
    沈阳学校被强占六万儿童失学
    【新华社东北廿八日电】蒋军侵占下的本溪市人民无法生活，逃到解放区者日多。自本月十一日至十三日三天内，仅搬至解放区本溪县一区的即达四家之多，新搬来的一位富徽生先生说：“在本溪城日子真无法过，很多人想到解放区，但中央军军卡子太多，不容易走出来，不过逼的太急了，卡子多还是要走出来的。”据说本溪城物价较前涨二十九倍，比现在解放区物价高三倍至十倍。依九月十一日本溪物价与其附近解放区比较，本溪高粱每斤六百元，较解放区高六倍。猪肉几贵三倍，小鸡相差更多，竟高出五倍，因为本溪老百姓的鸡均已被蒋军吃光。
    【新华社东北二十八日电】沈阳讯：沈阳全市失学儿童共达六万余名，大多数学校校舍都被军队强占着，迄今不能开课，勉强开课者亦多缺门少窗，几百个学生挤在一个教室，三人一个凳子，六人一张小桌。小学教员月薪最多只能领到一千多元流通券，生活没法维持，投奔解放区及改业者颇多。有些学校因教师缺乏实行“半日开课制”。全沈十五个省立中学二百多教员曾于上月十八日全体罢教，要求当局改善待遇，获得一万五千个学生的全力支援。沈市大学教育至今只有一个“大学先修班”，强令“伪高中学生”先受两年“先修”训练，很多青年学生或者入不了学，或者不愿受国民党的“训练”尚流浪街头。
