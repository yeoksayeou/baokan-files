Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, November 17th: According to a Central News Agency report, Chiang Kai-shek received the "Sino-American Agricultural Technology Cooperation Group" on the morning of the 14th. This group was formally established at the end of June. After arriving in China, it traveled to fifteen provinces. Chinese public opinion strongly opposed the establishment of the group, unanimously pointing out that the group's purpose was to realize "Industrial America, Agricultural China," turning China into a U.S. dependency.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, November 18th: Nanjing dispatch: After "paying their respects" to Chiang Kai-shek, the American personnel of the "Sino-American Agricultural Technology Cooperation Group" left Nanjing on the 17th for Shanghai and will soon fly back to the United States. The American personnel of the group arrived in China on June 27th and, together with Chiang's personnel, flew to various places to "investigate" China's agricultural situation. They spent eleven weeks traversing fifteen provinces. After returning to Nanjing last month on the 6th, they spent another six weeks drafting a "survey report" of more than forty pages, which was distributed to the U.S. and Chiang governments for adoption and implementation. According to the heads of the U.S. and Chiang sides at a press conference held here on the 17th, the "Sino-American cooperation" plan outlined in the report includes establishing an "Agricultural Bank" to control national agricultural finance, setting up an "Agricultural Control Bureau" under Chiang's Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and establishing "chemical fertilizer factories." Observers here generally believe that this is the concrete embodiment of the American imperialist plan of "Industrial America, Agricultural China." If this proposal is implemented, American imperialism will completely control China's countryside.

　　“工业美国农业中国”具体化
    美国血手伸入我农村
    “中美农业合作团”遨游各省
    【新华社延安十七日电】据中央社讯：十四日上午，蒋介石接见“中美农业技术合作团”。按该团系于六月底正式成立，抵中国后，周游十五省，中国舆论界对该团成立曾猛烈反对，一致指出该团目的乃是“工业美国农业中国”要使中国成为美国的附庸。
    【新华社延安十八日电】南京讯：“中美农业技术合作团”美方人员于“晋谒”蒋介石后，已于十七日离京转沪，即将飞返美国。该团美方人员系于六月二十七日抵华后即偕同蒋方人员飞各地“考察”中国农业情况，费时十一周，遍历十五省，于上月六日返回南京后，复以六周时间草成一长达四十余页的“考察报告书”，分送美蒋政府采纳施行。据十七日美蒋两方团长在此间招待记者会上透露，报告书所拟定的“中美合作”计划，包括建立一“农业银行”以控制全国农业金融，在蒋政府农林部下设置“农业管制总局”，及设立“化学肥料工厂”等项。此间观察家咸认此为美帝国主义“工业美国农业中国”计划的具体化，照此拟议实施结果，将是美帝国主义完全控制了中国的农村。
