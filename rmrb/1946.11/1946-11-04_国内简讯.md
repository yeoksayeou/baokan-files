　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st. Early in October, a man claiming to be an "Anti-Japanese soldier from Linshui County" appeared on the streets of Chongqing, stating that his mountain forest property had been seized by officials, and his seventy-year-old mother had been beaten to death with bricks. Therefore, he came to Chongqing to file a complaint. He held up a "Green Dragon" petition and went directly to the court. Passersby were all indignant and gave him much sympathy and donations.
　　The Chongqing Dagong Evening News reported: The reason why the "Hankou Investigation Team" has been slow to expose major cases is said to be related to "a certain Central Committee member's stay in Hankou for several days." The newspaper commented that the investigation team did indeed "hit tigers," but their technique was "lightly brushing."
　　Nanjing News: Police Chief Han Wenhuan recently stated that vagrants and beggars on the streets of Nanjing will be completely rounded up on a regular basis and sent to beggar shelters for care. A small civil servant said that because his family burden was too heavy, if his whole family were taken away, they would definitely resort to begging.
　　Nanjing: The major traitors detained in the Tiger Bridge prison have actually organized a "prison government" in prison, addressing each other as "President" and "Minister" and are about to issue a circular telegram.

    【新华社延安一日电】十月初重庆街上出现一自称“邻水县抗战军人”者，以山林产业被官吏强占，七十岁老母复被用砖头击毙，故至渝控诉。彼手举青龙状径赴地院诉状，路人均为愤慨，给与同情赠与甚多。
    渝大公晚报载：“汉口清查团”对巨大案件所以迟未揭发，据说与“某中委日前过汉停留数日”有关，该报评称清查团的确打虎，其技术为“轻擦”。
    南京息：警察厅长韩文焕近表示，将京市街头游民乞丐，定期全部肃清，送人乞丐收容所管养。某小公务员因家庭负担过重，如全家被尽去，定举家行乞。
    南京被拘押于老虎桥之诸巨奸竟在狱中组织“监狱政府”，互称院长部长且将发表通电。
