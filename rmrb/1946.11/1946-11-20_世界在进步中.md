The World is Progressing

"The world is progressing"—this is the summary of events of the past week, such as the French general election, the British House of Commons debate, and the Japanese labor movement.

In the French National Assembly election on November 10, the French Communist Party won an unprecedented majority of 168 seats, becoming the largest party. This proves the bankruptcy of the domestic reactionaries' obstruction and the interference of American imperialism. The French democratic movement continues to move forward, and the strength and prestige of the French Communist Party among the people are deeply rooted. As a result of this election, the Bidault government will resign at the end of this month, and the French Communist Party has requested to assume the main responsibility in the reorganized new government. The high prestige of the French Communist Party in French domestic affairs and its foreign policy will be conducive to the development of world peace and democracy.

When the British House of Commons discussed the Labor government's policy direction from the 12th, 57 Labor members of Parliament (that is, one-seventh of the 393 Labor members in the House of Commons) jointly put forward a motion criticizing the government's policy, criticizing the Labor government for siding with the United States and opposing the Soviet Union's support for reactionary forces in Greece and Spain, and demanding that Britain not act as a tail of American imperialism, but adopt a friendly policy towards the Soviet Union. This move has aroused great attention from British and American political circles, calling it "Britain's Wallace incident." This move, coinciding with the Anglo-Soviet trade agreement negotiations, is undoubtedly a powerful factor in promoting Anglo-Soviet rapprochement. Similar to the fact that 40% of the delegates to the British Trades Union Congress at the end of last month opposed the current foreign policy, it reflects that the broad masses and cadres within the Labor Party are increasingly leaning to the left.

Japan's strike movement has continued after the October Offensive, and the recent development is characterized by raising demands from economic to political ones. The Federation of Industrial Organizations, led by the Japanese Communist Party and the left wing of the Socialist Party, announced on the 12th that it would strive to overthrow the Yoshida Cabinet. Even the Labor Federation, controlled by the right wing of the Socialist Party, also demanded the resignation of the cabinet due to the demands of the broad masses. The Japanese Communist Party has demanded the establishment of a democratic coalition government to replace the current government.

In this forward-progressing world, the two major conferences in New York—the Council of Foreign Ministers and the United Nations General Assembly—continue to be held. This week, the focus of the Foreign Ministers' meeting is the legal system of the Free Territory of Trieste. The United States and Britain still insist that the Governor of the region should be given great power, while Poland and the Soviet Union insist that the power should be given to the democratic People's Assembly. The focus of discussions at the United Nations General Assembly is the trusteeship system. The United States has put forward a so-called trusteeship plan that is actually a US monopoly of the former Japanese mandated territories in the Pacific. The Soviet representative demanded that certain countries abandon selfish considerations and follow the principle of leading the people of the trust territories to independence.

    世界在进步中
    “世界在进步中”，——这是过去一周内法国大癣英国下院辩论和日本工运等事件的总结。
    十一月十日的法国国民议会选举中，法国共产党以获得一六八席的空前的多数而荣膺第一党，这证明国内反动派的阻挠及美帝国主义的干涉之破产。法国民主运动依然迈步向前，法共的力量及其在人民中的威信是根深蒂固的。由于此次选举结果，比道尔政府将于本月底辞职，法共已要求在将改组的新政府中负主要职责。由于法共在法国内政及其在外交上的高度威信，将有利于世界和平民主的发展。
    英国下院于十二日起讨论工党政府施政方针时，有五十七位工党议员（即占下院中三九三名工党议员的七分之一），联名提出一议案，抨击政府的政策，抨击工党政府跟在美国一边而反对苏联支持希腊及西班牙反动势力，要求英国不要作美帝国主义的尾巴，而采取对苏友好政策。此举引起英美政界人士极大注意，称之为“英国的华莱士事件”，此举正与英苏新商约谈判同时，无疑是促进英苏接近的有力因素。它与上月下旬英职工大会中百分之四十的代表反对现行外交政策之一样，反映工党内部广大群众与干部正日益左倾。
    日本的罢工运动，继十月攻势之后仍持续中，最近发展的特点为从经济要求提高到政治要求。在日共、社会党左派领导下的产业工会联合会，已于十二日宣布为推翻吉田内阁而努力，甚至在社会党右派把持下的劳工联合会，亦因广大群众要求而要求内阁辞职。日本共产党已要求成立民主的联合政府以代替现政府。
    在这向前进步的世界中，纽约的两大会议——四强外长会议与联合国大会的继续举行，这一周外长会议讨论中心为的里雅斯特自由区法制问题。美英仍主张应将大权予该区总督，而波兰苏联则主张大权归于民主的人民议会。联合国大会上的讨论中心则为托管制问题，美方提出了实际上是美国独占太平洋上前日委在统治区的所谓托管计划，苏代表要求某些国家放弃自私的考虑，而遵循使托管地人民走向独立的原则。
