　　Military Region Engineering and Artillery Teams Complete Training, Soon to Head to the Self-Defense Front
　　[Report from our newspaper in Handan on the 31st] The Military Region Engineering and Artillery Teams, having completed three months of training, are about to graduate and return to the front lines of the patriotic self-defense war. On the 20th, all trainees of the teams held a combined arms exercise with infantry and artillery in the suburbs of Handan to review the results of their three months of study. The results were excellent, especially the special shooting of mortars, which was accurate every time. Deputy Commander Wang of the Military Region praised them on the spot and expressed his hope that they would continue to train and study during breaks in the war after returning to the front. Finally, Deputy Commander Wang pointed out: The war is a long-term one, so he called on all soldiers and civilians in the region to combine combat and learning, and to conduct intensive training at all times, so as to continuously increase the number of technical arms at the front and smash Chiang Kai-shek's offensive as soon as possible.
