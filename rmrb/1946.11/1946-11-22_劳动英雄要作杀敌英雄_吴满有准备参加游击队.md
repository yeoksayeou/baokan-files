　　Labor Hero to Become an Anti-Japanese Hero
    Wu Manyou Prepares to Join Guerrilla Force
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th] Wu Manyou, the nationally renowned labor hero, is preparing to join the guerrilla force for self-defense. On the 28th of last month, labor hero Wu Manyou sent his eighteen-year-old son to join the army to defend the border region, but Hu Zongnan's offensive has become increasingly fierce. Now the entire village of Wu Manyou has been mobilized, men and women, old and young. The young and middle-aged are practicing techniques such as planting landmines and shooting, and a group of people have been drawn to the southern front to repair defense works. Wu Manyou is already fifty-three years old, but he still demands to join the guerrilla force for self-defense. Ten years ago, he was a penniless pauper. Now he has saved dozens of dan of grain and a large herd of cattle and sheep. He said: These are all the benefits that Chairman Mao has given us. With Hu Zongnan coming, all the people in the border region are soldiers and will take up arms to defend themselves, and they will definitely drive these bastards out!

    吴满有准备参加游击队
    【新华社延安十九日电】全国闻名的劳动英雄吴满有准备参加游击队进行自卫。上月二十八日，劳动英雄吴满有曾送他十八岁的儿子参军，保卫边区，但胡宗南的攻势愈来愈凶，现在吴满有村全村男女老幼已动员起来，青壮年练习埋地雷射击等技术，并抽调一部人去南线修防御工事。吴满有已五十三岁了，但还要求参加游击队进行自卫。在十年以前，他是一个一无所有的穷光蛋，现在存了几十担粮食，大群的牛羊，他说：这都是毛主席给我们的好处。胡宗南来了，全边区的老百姓都是兵，都会拿起武器来自卫，一定要把这些王八旦赶出去！
