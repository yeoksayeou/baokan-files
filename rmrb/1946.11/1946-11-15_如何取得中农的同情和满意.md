How to Obtain the Sympathy and Satisfaction of Middle Peasants
　　He Li
    I. The Emergence of the Middle Peasant Problem
　　In the Taiyue District, the mass movement over the past nine months has united a large number of middle peasants to participate in the struggle. Especially during the grievance-airing and revenge movement in the spring of this year, many middle peasants took the lead and stood at the forefront of the movement; many also participated in the rent reduction and debt liquidation.
　　However, because some of our comrades failed to recognize that middle peasants are also a basic mass suffering from feudal exploitation and oppression, some places implicated some middle peasants in the struggles of anti-traitor liquidation, rent reduction and interest reduction, and rent and interest refunds. Although these middle peasants who were struggled against are a minority within the middle peasant class, they account for a considerable number of the targets of struggle in many places.
　　The reasons for the implication of middle peasants are very complex. There are indeed individual traitors and local bullies among the middle peasants who are resented by the masses. For example, Fan Zhengtang in Xia County was a traitor and a local bully, and his class status was that of a middle peasant. However, he had connections with the enemy, puppet, and Kuomintang forces, and colluded with them to kill 72 people. Such a big traitor and bully goes beyond the scope of the general middle peasant problem. However, in the feudal society under the rule of the enemy, puppets, and Kuomintang, the general middle peasants did not occupy a dominant position in the rural areas. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, many middle peasants were coerced and enticed by the enemy and puppets to become lackeys and did some things that were detrimental to the people, and they also gained some crumbs; but this is essentially different from the traitors and bullies who were determined to do evil. Therefore, we should treat different objects differently. Secondly, the issue of rent and interest: some relatively well-off middle peasants, either based on mutual assistance among peasants, or due to women's private savings, lent small amounts of money to solve their own difficulties with needles and threads, or prepared for their own daughters' marriages and sons' weddings, and debt relationships occurred between them and the peasants; some middle peasants also rented out part of their land due to lack of labor, especially orphans and widows who could not help but rent out their land, but this is also different from the exploitation of landlords and usurers. Therefore, we can only use mediation to resolve these issues and settle them peacefully.
　　II. Middle Peasants Are the Basic Masses
　　Many materials prove that middle peasants are exploited and oppressed. For example, during the grievance-airing and revenge movement, most middle peasants participated in the struggle against traitors, bullies, and corruption, because they were more affluent than poor peasants, and extra levies in the village were mostly imposed on them, and the targets of extortion by local tyrants and evil gentry were also mostly them, and today's poor peasants were mostly transformed from middle peasants in the past. As for the exploitation of usury and tenancy, they are in some places no less than poor peasants, especially debtors are very common. According to the statistics of debt households in nine villages in the third district of Jilu, there were 79 rich middle peasants and middle peasant debtors, which was 12 more than the 67 poor, destitute, and hired peasants combined. Comrades working in Linfen said: There are also more middle peasants in debt than poor peasants in Linfen. This shows that middle peasants are heavily exploited by usury. Let's look at the tenancy relationship again. According to statistics from three villages in the first district of Jilu, there were a total of 89 tenant households, including 3 rich peasants, 8 rich middle peasants, 44 middle peasants, and 30 poor peasants. The rich middle peasants and middle peasants together accounted for 52 households, exceeding the poor peasants by two-fifths. Among the land renters in Lingdong Village, 20 middle peasants (including rich middle peasants) rented a total of 1618.8 mu of land, only a quarter less than the 14 poor peasant households who rented land. This shows that the middle peasant class is as much exploited as the poor peasants in terms of tenancy.
　　In summary, although middle peasants are more affluent than poor and hired peasants in rural areas, they have relatively sufficient self-cultivated land, and some even have livestock, and generally speaking, they can barely support themselves. However, the oppression they suffer, if calculated by property figures, may not be less. Therefore, from the analysis of rural economic relations, they should belong to the basic masses, not intermediaries, let alone feudal rulers (targets of struggle).
　　Moreover, the middle peasants occupy an extremely important position in the rural areas, accounting for almost half of the peasant population. Generally, they are no less than the poor and hired peasants, especially after the elimination of feudalism, the middle peasants become the main class in the rural areas. This further illustrates that the middle peasants occupy an important position at all times. Whether in the past Anti-Japanese War or in today's anti-civil war and democratic reform movement, they have made great efforts. If we ignore them, that is, ignore the great suffering in their hearts, and only see the "small spots" on their faces, and are "not interested" in them, and do not obtain their complete satisfaction and sympathy, then we will make the movement isolated. The concept of "middle peasants are the basic masses" must be clarified, and uniting the middle peasants and poor and hired peasants to fight against feudal forces is our correct line.
　　III. How to Unite the Middle Peasants
　　Uniting the middle peasants is a very important task. The principle of uniting the middle peasants is not to infringe on the interests of the middle peasants, and to give the middle peasants benefits, in order to obtain their complete sympathy and satisfaction. The most basic link is to clearly define the class boundaries and clearly define the targets of struggle as traitors, bullies, and landlords. Therefore, in the anti-traitor liquidation, rent reduction and interest reduction, and rent and interest refunds, except for those whose nature has exceeded the middle peasant problem and are big traitors and big bullies who are publicly indignant by the masses, the involvement should not be too broad in general. As for the small rents and interests and mutual assistance daily borrowing among peasants, they cannot be equally liquidated, otherwise it will inevitably infringe on the middle peasants. Qinyuan has had a good example in solving this problem:
　　In February of this year, when Guzhai Village in the Sixth District of Qinyuan began to mobilize the masses to air their grievances, it was determined to struggle against more than a dozen "big households." The view of struggling against "big households" was not very clear in the first place. As a result of this struggle, the middle peasants were naturally involved. At that time, the leadership proposed mediation, with cadres, farmers' association groups, or neighbors jointly arbitrating. First, a meeting of activists was convened to study the issue. The meeting was a mess, with most people saying it should be calculated. A few people said it should not be calculated, and some said it should still be reconciled. The leadership then proposed to study the issue from the perspective of specific individuals: Where did the middle peasants' property come from? After studying each household, everyone suddenly realized: "Their property was all obtained through labor!" "If we calculate the middle peasants, we will have fewer people on our side. If we calculate one family, everyone will be afraid!" So the activists finally came to a conclusion: "This is fighting a 'civil war'!" After the meeting, the activists separately convened meetings of tenant debtors to get through the masses' minds. Finally, the chairman of the farmers' association spoke at the emancipation meeting, proposing that the middle peasants are the basic masses, pointing out that the peasants of the world are one family, guaranteeing that the middle peasants will not be calculated, and will not fall for the landlord's tricks. After the meeting, explanations and consolations were carried out. Since then, Guzhai has not liquidated the middle peasants. After this, the Sixth District of Qinyuan also adopted this method, and the problem of liquidating the middle peasants was solved throughout the district. This method of reconciliation and arbitration is the correct direction for us to solve the middle peasant problem.
　　As for the middle peasants who have been infringed upon, we should try to compensate them. We have discovered the following methods of compensation: 1. Seek compensation from the new fruits of struggle. Most middle peasants are exploited, and there are many opportunities to implement this method. For example, Ding ××, a middle peasant in Ding Village, Jilu, was calculated to have embezzled ten dan of grain because he was the village deputy. After Ding returned the grain, he asked to participate in the struggle to liquidate the debt of Lü Qinglong and recovered twenty-four dan of grain. Ding's mood immediately changed and he asked to join the farmers' association. 2. If most of the farmers in the whole village do not sympathize, it is also possible to consider returning part of the compensation. For example, in Chenjiazhuang, Jilu, one middle peasant calculated the debt of another middle peasant, and the calculation was too large. The masses did not sympathize, and finally part of the debt was returned and the two families reconciled. 3. In some places where there are no targets of struggle, public property, temple property, and social property can be used for compensation. 4. Organize mutual aid production and take care of them in production loans. In the past, many farmers in Shimin rose from mutual aid production. As long as they are helped a little, they can restore their former appearance and gain sympathy. 5. Explanation, this is a kind of spiritual compensation. Although some middle peasants have been struggled against and liquidated today, not many have been "seriously injured." We should universally comfort and explain to them, as long as we make them understand that there are reasons for them being struggled against, and then mobilize the masses to take care of them, the peasants can unite, and they have received many benefits from the Communist Party, the Eighth Route Army, and the democratic government. As long as we explain, their mood will easily change.
　　The distribution of fruits should enable both middle peasants and poor peasants to benefit. Our advocacy of "land to the tillers" is to enable landless and land-poor peasants to obtain land. Many middle peasants still need land. Distributing fruits to middle peasants can also make them understand the policy and change their skeptical mentality. Some middle peasants in some places said happily after receiving the fruits: "We are also our own people!" The Fourth District of Yicheng implemented a method of appropriately distributing fruits, and 90% of the middle peasants received fruits, which is a very good method.
　　To unite the middle peasants to fight together, we should also widely absorb middle peasant activists and train them to become leading backbones, treating them equally with poor and hired peasants. In the early stage of the movement in Jincheng this year, there was a phenomenon of closing the door to middle peasants. After reviewing this at the March meeting, after recognizing that "peasants are one family and the target is the landlords," a large number of middle peasant activists emerged, and the farmers' association and militia were greatly increased, which made the movement more developed. This also shows that developing middle peasant activists not only does not harm the movement, but plays a greater role in promoting it.

    如何取得中农的同情和满意
    贺笠
    一、中农问题的引起
    太岳区九个月来的群众运动，团结广大的中农参加了斗争。特别是今年春季诉苦复仇运动，许多地方的中农都打了先锋，站在运动的前列；就是在减租清债中中农参加的亦不少。
    但是由于我们有些同志没认清中农也是受封建剥削压榨的基本群众，因而有些地方在反奸清算、减租减息与退租退息等斗争中，带了一些中农。虽然这些被斗争的中农在中农这个阶层说来是少数，但从被斗争对象来说，他们在不少的地方是占着相当大的数字。
    引起中农被斗原因是很复杂的，在中农当中确有个别为群众所痛愤的汉奸、恶霸。如夏县有一个汉奸兼恶霸的范正堂，成分属于中农，然而他与敌伪顽各方均有联系，并勾结敌伪杀害群众七十二人。像这样的大奸大霸，已超出一般中农问题的范围。但在敌伪顽统治下的封建社会里，一般中农在农村中并不占统治地位。在八年的抗日战争中，有不少的中农被敌伪胁迫利诱当了走卒，作了些不利于人民的事，也多少分得一点牙秽；但这与死心为恶的奸霸有本质的区别。因此我们应看不同对象不同处理。其次租息问题：有些较为富裕的中农，或基于农民之间互助，或由于女人私蓄，放个小账以解决自己一针一线的困难，或准备自己将来嫁闺女娶媳妇之用，与农民之间发生了债务关系；亦有的中农因劳力缺乏而出租了一部分土地，特别是孤儿寡妇他们不能不出租土地，但这些与地主、高利贷者剥削也有区别。因之，我们处理这些问题，只能用调解的方式，和解了事。
    二、中农是基本群众
    许多材料证明：中农是被剥削者，被压迫者。如诉苦复仇时，大部中农都参加了反奸霸反贪污的斗争，原因就是他们比贫农富裕，村里的额外摊派多在他们头上，豪绅恶霸敲榨的对象也多是他们，今天的贫农也多是过去中农所蜕化的。至于受高利贷与租佃的剥削，他们有些地方也并不亚于贫农，特别是欠债户很普遍。据稷麓第三区九个村的债户统计，富裕中农与中农欠债户为七十九户，比贫农赤贫雇农合计的六十七户，尚多十二户。临汾工作同志谈：临汾欠债中农亦多于贫农。从这里就说明了中农受高利贷剥削是很多的。再看租佃关系。据稷麓一区三个村统计，共有佃户八十九户，其中富农三户、富裕中农八户、中农四十四户、贫农三十户，富裕中农与中农合计共五十二户，超过贫农五分之二。岭东村租地户中，二十户中农（富裕中农在内），共租入土地一六一八·八亩，较之十四户贫农租地仅少四分之一。这说明了中农阶层在租佃关系上与贫农同样是被剥削者。
    综上所述，中农在农村中虽比贫雇农优裕，他们有比较充足的自耕土地，而且有的有牲口，一般说来勉能自给。然而他们所受压榨如以财产数字计算，不一定少。所以我们从农村经济关系来分析，他们应属于基本群众，不是中间人，更不是封建统治者（斗争对象）。
    而且中农在农村中所占地位是极其重要的，他们几乎占着农民人口的一半。一般不少于贫雇农，特别是消除封建后，中农成为农村主要阶层。这更说明中农在任何时候都占着重要的地位，无论在过去抗日战争中，在今天反内战与民主改革运动中，他们都尽了很大的力量。如果我们把他们这些忽略了，即忽略了他们心中的大苦，而只看到他们脸上的“小黑”，对他们“不感冒”，不取得他们的完全满意与同情，那末我们就将会使运动陷于孤立。“中农是基本群众”，这一观念必须明确起来，团结中农与贫雇农共同向封建势力斗争，这就是我们的正确路线。
    三、怎样团结中农
    团结中农是一件很重要的工作，团结中农的原则是不侵犯中农利益，并给予中农以利益，以取得他们的完全同情和满意。最基本的环节，是明确划分阶级界线，明确斗争对象是奸霸地主。因而在反奸清算、减租减息、退租退息中，除了它的性质已超出中农问题、为群众公愤的大奸、大霸主以外，一般不应牵连太广。至于农民中间微小的租息及互助性的日常借火，更不能同等的清算，否则就必然侵及中农。解决这一问题，沁源曾有过好的范例：
    今年二月间，沁源六区古寨村开始发动群众诉苦时，确定了要斗争十几家“大户”。本来斗“大户”观点就不很明确。这样斗争的结果，很自然的牵涉到中农。当时领导上就提出调解，由干部、农会小组或邻家共同仲裁。先召开积极分子会议研究，会场上吵的一塌糊涂，大部分人都说该算。少部分人说不该算，还有的说仍要和解。领导上便提出从具体的人来研究：中农的家产是那里来的？经过挨家研究，于是大家都醒悟过来：“他们的家产都是劳动得来的！”“算了中农，自己人少了，算了一家不打紧，大家都怕了！”于是积极分子最后得出一个结论：“这是打‘内战’呢！”会后积极分子又分头召开佃债户会议，打通了群众思想。最后农会主席又在翻身大会上讲话，提出中农是基本群众，指出天下农民是一家，保证不算中农，不上地主挑拨的当。会后又进行解释安慰，从此古寨就不清算中农了。此后沁源六区亦采用此办法，全区都解决了清算中农的问题。这个和解、仲裁的办法，就是我们解决中农问题的正确方向。
    至于已被侵犯的中农，应设法补偿。补偿的办法，我们已发现的有如下几种：一、从新的斗争果实中来求得补偿。中农大多都受剥削，实行这种办法的机会颇多。如稷麓丁村中农丁××，因为当村副贪污被算出十石粮，丁退粮后，要求参加斗争向吕清龙清债，退回二十四石粮，丁情绪立即转变，要求参加了农会。二、如果有全村大多农民都不同情，亦可斟酌退回一部补偿。如稷麓陈家庄有一家中农算另一家中农的账，算的过大，群众不同情，终于退回一部两家和好。三、有些地方已无斗争对象的，可用公产、庙产、社产补偿。四、组织互助生产，从生产贷款中加以照顾。这在士敏过去就有很多农民从互助生产翻起身来的，只要略帮助，就可恢复旧观，取得同情。五、解释，这是一种精神上的补偿。今天虽然有些中农被斗争清算，但“伤筋动骨”的还不算多，应普遍作安慰、解释，只要使他们自己了解被斗争也是有他本身的原因，然后再动员群众照顾，农民就可团结起来，而且他们得到共产党八路军与民主政府的实惠很多，只要一解释，情绪也容易转变。
    分配果实应使中农与贫农都能得到利益。我们耕者有其田的主张，是要使无地和地少的农民得到土地，中农当中有不少的人仍是需要土地的。对中农分果实，这也可使其了解政策而改变怀疑的心理。有些地方的中农分得果实后，都高兴的说：“我们也是自己人了！”翼城四区实行适当分配果实的办法，百分之九十的中农都得到果实，这是很好的办法。
    团结中农一齐斗争，还应该广泛吸收中农积极分子，并培养成为领导骨干，与贫雇农一视同仁。晋城在今年运动初期，曾有过对中农关门的现象。后在三月会议检讨后，认清了“农民是一家，目标是地主”之后，中农积极分子便大批涌现出来，农会与民兵都得到很大的增加，这就使得运动得到更大的开展。这也说明了发展中农积极分子，不仅对运动无损，而是起更大的推动作用。
