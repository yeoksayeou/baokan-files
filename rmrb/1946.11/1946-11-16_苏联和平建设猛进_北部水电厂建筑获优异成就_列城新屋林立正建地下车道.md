Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, November 13th: Comprehensive Report: The Soviet working people are carrying out peaceful construction at an astonishing speed. The construction personnel of various hydroelectric power stations have exceeded the plan for the first ten months stipulated in the Five-Year Plan for hydroelectric construction, exceeding the total of last year by 50 percent. Among them, the greatest achievement is the construction of the northern hydroelectric power plant. The recently restored hydroelectric power plant has increased the supply of electricity to Leningrad by 100,000 kilowatts. Georgia is also building a new large hydroelectric power plant. This technology is extremely complex, and this type of design is the first of its kind in the Soviet Union. The people of Leningrad have spent 400 million rubles this year to complete the reconstruction work after being bombed by the enemy, most of which was used for building houses. In the past nine months, the residents of Leningrad have obtained 200,000 square meters of living space. Trolleybuses and buses have opened several new routes, and the reconstruction of the special buildings of the Russian Museum has been preliminarily completed. Regarding the supply of gas to residents, 22,000 houses will be equipped with gas pipelines this year. At present, the biggest event in the city is the construction of the new Leningrad underground electric tramway.
