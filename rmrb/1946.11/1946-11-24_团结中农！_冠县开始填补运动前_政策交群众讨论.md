　　Unite with the Middle Peasants!
　　Guan County Begins Pre-Land Reform Movement:
　　Policies Submitted for Mass Discussion
　　[Our newspaper's Weixian dispatch, 20th] The pre-land reform movement in the old district of Guan County is about to be universally launched. In order to effectively grasp the policy of uniting with the middle peasants, the leadership conducted discussions with more than two thousand county, district, and village cadres before the movement, emphasizing the unity of the middle peasants. Most villages also convened mass meetings, universally holding group discussions to classify social strata based on production and exploitative relationships, putting forward the idea that the middle and poor peasants are one family. Currently, 34 villages in the Third District have determined the targets to be investigated, some of whom have already been struggled against, and some villages are preparing for struggle. Fourteen villages with no struggle targets are turning to organizing mutual aid production. The Fourth District, influenced by Wu Xun and the mass movement in the new district of Xin County, coupled with the fact that some villages did not have good policy publicity, such as in Fengzhuang, where the peasant association discussed who to struggle against and proposed struggling against the "fleshy households" (households with savings); in Xiaozhangzhuang, without sufficient preparation, rich middle peasants were mistakenly identified as rich peasants, causing panic among middle and rich middle peasants, leading to slaughtering pigs, selling cattle, and excessive eating and drinking. The leadership discovered the above problems and immediately convened village cadre meetings and mass meetings in various villages to continue publicizing the middle peasant policy. The village cadres in Xiaozhangzhuang took over the process, which was criticized by village cadres from various villages in the sub-district. After discussion, the masses in the village have returned the items confiscated from the middle peasants. Regarding the unity of the broad masses of peasants, the county committee re-issued a circular, pointing out: (1) The education of uniting with the middle peasants should be implemented among village cadres and the masses, and this thought and experience of uniting with the middle peasants should be exchanged in a timely manner. (2) When distributing floating wealth, impoverished peasants should receive a share, but if middle peasants express dissatisfaction due to egalitarianism, it is necessary to conduct good education to maintain unity. Some villages first convene poor peasant meetings and then mass meetings when discussing investigation targets. The meetings of poor peasants often cause middle peasants to feel afraid and uneasy; this method can be changed. In Tangzhuang, the policy was not conveyed to the masses. In Xiyezhuang, the policy conveyed to the masses said: rich peasants and middle peasants can also be struggled against. In Dongyezhuang, there are no landlords or rich peasants, and some village cadres are ideologically inflexible, wanting to struggle against middle peasants. A public security officer even scolded two village cadres who were conveying the middle peasant policy in the village, which is all wrong. In total, in the six districts, apart from more than 80 villages that have no more struggle targets and are turning to production, the pre-land reform movement in more than 200 villages is about to begin.

　　团结中农！
    冠县开始填补运动前
    政策交群众讨论
    【本报威县二十日电】冠县老区的填平补齐运动即将普遍展开。领导上为切实掌握团结中农的政策，运动前与两千余县区村干部作了讨论，强调了团结中农。大部村庄亦召开了群众大会，普遍分组讨论，以生产剥削关系为根据，划分了阶层，提出中贫农是一家。目前，三区有三十四村研究好该查对象，有的已经斗起来，有的村正准备斗争，有十四个没斗争对象的村庄转向组织互助生产。四区因受武训、莘县新区群运大干的影响，加以有的村没很好的宣传政策，如凤庄农会讨论斗啥人，即提出斗肉头户；小张庄没有酝酿成熟，误认富中农为富农，致使中农、富中农恐慌，杀猪卖牛，大吃大喝。领导上发现了以上问题，立即召集村干大会，各村群众会，继续宣传中农政策。小张庄村干包办，遭到小区各村村干批评。该村群众经过讨论，已将斗争中农的东西退回。对于团结广大农民，县委复发出通报，指出：（一）在村干、群众中要贯彻团结中农的教育，把这思想和团结中农的经验要及时交流。（二）分浮财时，赤贫农应该分，但中农因平均主义思想表示不满，要很好进行教育，保持团结。有的村在讨论查减对象时，先召开贫农会，后开群众会。贫农开会时常使中农害怕不安，这种方式可以改变。汤庄没给群众传达政策。西野庄对群众传达政策时说：富农、中农也可斗。东野庄没有地主、富农，有几个村干思想不开，要斗中农，公安员还骂在村中传达中农政策的两个村干，这都是不对的。总计六个区，除八十多村已无斗争对象转入生产外，二百余村的填平补齐运动即将展开。
