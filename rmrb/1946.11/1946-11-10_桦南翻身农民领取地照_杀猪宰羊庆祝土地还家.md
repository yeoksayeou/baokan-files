　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 4th. After the land distribution in Huanan County, Hejiang Province, land deeds were widely distributed in various villages. Peasants in Lishuyuan celebrated "land returning home" by selecting an auspicious day, slaughtering pigs and sheep, erecting a paifang (archway), and sending out invitations. Hundreds of men, women, and children from the entire village gathered together in joy. Each household's land deed was placed in a red envelope, and people collected them in groups of three according to their number. Amidst the music, they all bowed three times to the people's leader Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. An old peasant couldn't wait for everyone to gather and bowed three times on his own. When others told him to wait for everyone to bow together, he smiled and said, "I'll bow three more times when they come. I'd be happy to bow a hundred times to our Chairman Mao." Wang Quanfu, who was over sixty years old, pointed to the land deed and said, "This is the greatest wealth in a hundred years, a son to provide for me in my old age." Zhang Siqing, a poor scholar, even wrote an essay to celebrate.
    Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 7th. After land reform in Jia Village, Lin County, the income of more than 300 households in the entire village has doubled this autumn compared to previous years. After the village's liberation last autumn, the democratic government confiscated more than 2,000 mu of land and property from the traitor Su Tiren and distributed it all to more than 160 poor peasants. Each household received at least 20 mu of land, and middle peasants also received property. The masses actively developed production, expanded cultivated land by 800 mu, and increased the number of livestock to more than 80. Bai Baogui's family, who used to be a hired laborer, received 50 mu of land and harvested 15 shi of grain. Before winter even arrived, they had prepared leather jackets and cotton-padded coats, and ate white flour steamed buns during the holidays. The rich peasant Zhu Zhizhang cultivated 200 mu of land, harvested 40 shi of grain, and also ran workshops and engaged in transportation, achieving a surplus while cultivating. The landlord Wu Peilie diligently cultivated the more than 200 mu of land left to him by the masses, and his life is quite comfortable. The peasants' cultural demands have also increased accordingly. The primary school, which had been suspended for many years, was restored at the beginning of last month, and forty-three young people enthusiastically joined the army to defend their hometown.

    【新华社东北四日电】合江省桦南县分配土地完毕后，各村普遍分发地照。梨树园农民庆祝“土地还家”，特选了吉日，杀猪宰羊，搭牌楼，下请贴。全村数百余男女老幼欢聚一起。每户的地照都用红信封装着，三人一班按号领取。并在乐声中一齐向人民领袖毛主席、朱总司令三鞠躬。一个老农民没等人齐就独自鞠三个躬，旁人告诉他等人齐鞠躬，他笑着说：“等他们来了我再鞠三躬，给咱毛主席鞠一百个躬也是高兴的。”六十多岁的王全福指着地照说：“这是百年来的大富贵，是给我养老的儿子。”穷塾师张思清并著文庆祝。
    【新华社晋绥七日电】临县贾庄村经过土地改革，全村三百余户今秋收入较往年增加一倍。该村于去秋解放后，民主政府即将汉奸苏体仁之财产土地二千多亩，全部没收，分给一百六十余户贫苦农民。每户最少得地廿亩，中农也分得财物。群众乃积极发展生产，扩大耕地八百亩，牲口增至八十多头。雇工白宝贵家分得五十亩，打粮十五石，未到冬天即备下皮衣棉袄，过节时吃白面馍。富农朱之章，种地二百亩，收粮四十石，并经营作坊、运输、做到耕二余一。地主吴佩烈将群众给留下的二百余亩土地，辛勤经营，生活很优裕。农民文化要求亦随之提高，停办多年的小学，已于上月初恢复，有四十三个青年踊跃参军保卫家乡。
