How to Make the Laborers Feel Secure in Logistics?
Experiences in Logistics Work in Central China
Wang Wenchang, Xu Xiong
Logistics work is one of the central tasks for winning the self-defense war. Based on the experience of laborers' work in Central China in recent months, to make the laborers feel secure in logistics, the leadership must pay attention to:

First, extensive and in-depth mobilization. The quality of the laborers' mobilization work is the first key to determining whether the laborers can be consolidated. Before participating in the northern front logistics work, Funing County conducted a war mobilization throughout the county, and each district conducted one to three large-scale reviews of logistics organization and exercises for rescuing the wounded. Therefore, no laborers in the county fled, and they completed their tasks cheerfully. In the East Sea Han Mountain area, the people's enthusiasm for participation was also extremely high because of the in-depth mobilization among the masses, with slogans such as "Fight to defend the land and protect the cattle." The laborers not only did not flee during the march, but also were able to hide well and maintain order when Chiang's planes strafed them. However, some counties and districts adopted incorrect mobilization methods, such as not telling the people the nature of the war, the term of service, and the location, and individual counties and districts used lottery methods to solve difficulties without listening to the opinions of the masses, only seeking to "complete the task." This style of work urgently needs to be changed. Facts have proved that only by following the mass line and conducting in-depth mobilization can the task be successfully completed.

Second, there must be strong cadres. The Party, government, and people must select strong cadres to participate in and lead logistics, organize the lower levels, care for and solve various difficulties of the laborers, and set an example by completing arduous tasks in various situations. Party committees at all levels must equip an appropriate number of Party members in various logistics organizations to lead and educate the laborers. The ×× region achieved this, mobilizing ××0,000 laborers and nearly one million people to directly and indirectly participate in logistics. The Tongyang laborers said, "The cadres lead, we follow, the cadres can take, we can get." This shows the great role of the cadres. In some places, the opposite results were obtained due to the use of individual bad elements.

Third, solve various difficulties of the laborers. The vast majority of those participating in the logistics team are basic masses from poorer families, so they have many difficulties that need to be solved:

(1) The problem of eating. Before the laborers depart for a certain place, a portion of grain and grass must be gathered in advance, as the saying goes, "Before the soldiers and horses move, food and fodder go first." Otherwise, the laborers will have difficulty eating one meal and not the next. Some counties had low morale among the laborers because grain and grass were not prepared.

(2) The problem of clothing. Some laborers did not bring cotton clothes. The solutions are: 1. Send cadres or laborers back to get them. 2. For those who do not have cotton clothes at home, borrow them temporarily from neighbors. 3. If borrowing is not possible, adopt a rotation service method.

(3) The problem of illness. Overcoming the phenomenon of laborers getting sick plays a great role in consolidating work. The solution is to educate the laborers to pay attention to hygiene, and also to equip doctors and medicines, and strengthen the political education of medical personnel, overcome certain irresponsible, wasteful, and opportunistic tendencies, improve efficiency, and reduce the number of sick people.

(4) The problem of family production. This is the issue that the laborers are most concerned about, and it is necessary to combine front-line logistics with rear production. In addition, problems such as illnesses and weddings/funerals in the laborers' families should be solved as much as possible.

Fourth, multifaceted education. The laborers' education must first understand their thoughts and psychology, and then carry out appropriate education. For example, when the Tongyang laborers first came, they had five fears: fear of going to the front line, fear of airplanes, fear of being soldiers, fear of meetings, and fear of prolonged time. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct education in different ways and with different content. The main task is to enlighten the masses' political consciousness and national awareness, expose the crimes of Chiang and the United States, and strengthen confidence in victory; in business education, it is necessary to explain in detail what logistics does, how to do it, and for whom to do it, so that they can understand in advance and do it well temporarily. In addition, review and reflection and casual talks are also the most effective methods of education. Here, the ideological problems of cadres and laborers can be discovered and solved, so that those who are not at ease become at ease, those who do not care about the masses care about the masses, and those who do not have the courage to go to the front line also become courageous. As for carrying out recreational activities to boost morale, it is all necessary. In short, various methods should be used to solve their ideological problems.

Fifth, launch the "people love the people" movement. Educate the laborers to pay attention to mass discipline, help the local government work and mass production, and establish the concept of "farmers all over the world are one family." Carrying out the "people love the people" movement is also a particularly important task, so the logistics team must pay special attention to mass discipline during marches and accommodations, give full play to the farmers' simple, honest, and loyal nature, and overcome their selfish, narrow, and stingy style. Many counties had violations of mass discipline at the beginning, causing resentment among the residents of the驻地, which affected the morale of the laborers. However, after actively and systematically launching the "people love the people" movement, helping the residents of the驻地 to produce, the relationship was greatly improved, and the people also gave gifts and food to the laborers. In this way, the life of the logistics team was improved, diseases were reduced, and the enthusiastic encouragement of the masses was obtained, and the morale was greatly stabilized. This movement is indeed an important link in consolidating the work of the laborers, and it must be implemented from the local administration to the masses, and from the logistics organization to the laborers, in order to be carried out on both sides.

In addition, the organization and use of laborers, life management, and leadership methods are also very important. Logistics headquarters at all levels must actively and regularly grasp the development of the war situation and the deployment of battles to meet the needs of the war, and put forward different slogans and materials in different situations to check, summarize, and correct. If this can be done, the laborers will feel secure in logistics work.

    怎样使民夫安心后勤？
    华中后勤工作经验
    王文长  徐熊
    后勤工作是争取自卫战争胜利的中心工作之一。根据华中近数月来民夫工作的经验，要使民夫安心后勤，在领导上必须注意：
    第一、广泛深入的动员。民夫动员工作的好坏是决定民夫能不能巩固的第一关。阜（宁）东县在参加北线后勤工作之先，全县曾进行了战争动员，各区又进行了一次到三次的后勤组织大检阅和抢救伤员的演习。因此，该县民夫无一逃跑者，并且兴高彩烈的完成任务。东海韩山区也因在群众中深入动员，提出“为保卫土地保卫耕牛而战”等口号，人民参加情绪极高。民夫在行军中不但无逃跑的现象，且在遭蒋机扫射时，仍能善为隐蔽秩序井然。但有些县区采取不正确的动员方法，如不正面的告诉人民战争性质，服役期限地点，以及个别县区用抽签办法不听取群众意见解决困难，只图“完成任务”，这种作风是急需转变的。事实证明：只有走群众路线，深入动员，才能胜利的完成任务。
    第二、要有坚强的干部。党、政、民都必需选派坚强的干部参加和领导后勤，组织下层，关心和解决民夫各种困难，并以身作则，在各种场合中完成艰苦的任务。各级党委必须在各种后勤组织中配备适当数量的党员，以领导和教育民夫。××地区做到了这点，即动员了××万民夫，并动员了近百万的人民直接间接参加了后勤。潼阳民夫说：“干部带头，我们随后，干部能拿，我们能取。”可见干部作用之大。有的地方，由于起用了个别坏分子便得到了相反的结果。
    第三、解决民夫各种困难。参加后勤队的绝大多数是家境较贫苦的基本群众，因而他们有很多困难需要解决：
    （１）吃的问题。民夫出发某地，必须事前集中一部分粮草，所谓“兵马未动，粮草先行。”否则使民夫吃这顿没那顿，发生很大困难。有的县因为粮草没有准备好，使得民夫情绪不高。
    （２）穿的问题。有的民夫前来未带棉衣，解决办法：一、派干部或民夫回去取。二、家中没有棉衣的人，邻家暂借。三、无法借者，采取轮流服务办法。
    （３）病的问题。克服民夫病的现象是对巩固工作起很大作用的。办法是教育民夫注意卫生，还要配备医生及药品，并加强医务人员的政治教育，克服某些不负责浪费捞一把的偏向，提高效率减少病员。
    （４）家中生产问题。这是民夫最关心的问题，必须把前方后勤和后方生产结合起来。此外，民夫家里的病人及红白喜事等问题都要尽量设法解决。
    第四、多方教育。民夫教育首先要了解其思想与心理，然后再适当进行，如潼阳民夫初来时有五怕，怕上前线、怕飞机、怕当兵、怕开会、怕时间拖长。因此，必须进行不同方式，不同内容的教育。主要是启发群众政治觉悟和民族意识，揭发蒋美罪恶，坚定胜利信心；在业务教育上，要详细讲明后勤作什么，怎样做和为谁做等，事先有所了解，临时才会很好的做。此外，检讨反省和漫谈也是一种最有效的教育方式，这里，可以发现干部民夫思想问题加以解决，使之不安心的安心，不关心群众的关心群众，没有勇气上前线的也变成有勇气。至于开展文娱活动，鼓舞情绪，均为必要。总之，要运用各种各样方式达到解决其思想上的问题。
    第五、开展“民爱民”运动。教育民夫注意群众纪律，帮助当地政府工作和群众生产，建立“天下农民是一家”的观念。开展“民爱民”运动也是特别重要的工作，因此后勤队无论在行军在住宿中，都必须特别注意群众纪律，发挥农民的朴素、诚实和忠厚的本质，克服其自私、狭隘和小气的作风。有很多县在开始时曾有违反群众纪律的现象，使驻地群众发生反感，处处给民夫以脸色，影响到民夫情绪。但当主动的有计划的开展“民爱民”运动后，帮助了驻地居民生产，关系大大改善，老百姓也纷纷送礼物食品给民夫，这样后勤队的生活改善了，疾病减少了，又得群众热烈的鼓励，情绪大为安定。这一运动实为巩固民夫工作中的重要一环，要从当地行政贯彻到群众，从后勤组织贯彻到民夫，双方面进行才行。
    此外，民夫的组织使用和生活管理及领导办法亦甚重要。各级后勤司令部要主动的经常掌握战局的发展，战役的布置，以满足战争需要，并要在不同的情况下，提出不同口号及材料，以检查总结和改正。能做到这样，民夫便会安心后勤工作。
