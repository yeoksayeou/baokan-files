    Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 17th—Recently, in the southern Shandong offensive, Jiang’s troops actually used poison gas. In Zaozhuang, Yixian, Tai’erzhuang and other places in southern Shandong, the American-equipped 28th Division, 80th Brigade of Jiang's army drove the 59th and 77th Divisions, originally under Feng Zhi’an of the Northwest Army, along with 30 tanks, 24 airplanes, dozens of artillery pieces, and dozens of armored vehicles. After Chiang Kai-shek announced the so-called “cease-fire order” on the morning of the 11th, they repeatedly attacked the New Fourth Army positions at Zhuluo and Quangou on the railway line north of Tai’erzhuang and south of Yixian, but were repelled each time. Exhausting all their tricks, Jiang’s troops disregarded humanitarian principles and released tear gas. The commanders and fighters of the New Fourth Army were filled with indignation and fought bravely. After fierce fighting until dusk, Jiang's troops could not hold out and fled towards Yixian, leaving behind a trail of corpses. In this battle, more than 3,000 of Jiang’s troops were killed or captured. After completing the mission of annihilating the enemy’s effective strength, the New Fourth Army took the initiative to transfer to the outer lines that evening to await opportunities to resist the enemy.

    鲁南蒋军犯台峄间
    被我歼灭三千
    穷途末路竟放毒气
    【新华社山东十七日电】蒋军近在鲁南进攻战中，竟使用毒弹。鲁南枣庄、峄县、台儿庄等地，美械蒋军二十八师八十旅驱使原西北军冯治安所属五十九及七十七师等部，附坦克三十辆，飞机二十四架，炮数十门，装甲车数十辆，于蒋介石宣布所谓“停战令”后之十一日晨，数次猛攻台儿庄以北，峄县以南，铁路线上的竹罗、圈沟等新四军阵地，均被击退。蒋军黔驴技穷，竟不顾人道施放催泪性毒瓦斯弹，新四军指战员愤慨万分，奋勇抗击，激战至黄昏，蒋军不支，遗尸继续向峄县逃窜。是役计毙俘蒋军三千余人，新四军于完成歼敌有生力量目的后，当晚即主动转移至外线待机抗击。
