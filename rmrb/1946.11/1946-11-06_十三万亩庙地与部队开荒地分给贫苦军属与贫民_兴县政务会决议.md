　　130,000 Mu of Temple Land and Military Reclamation Land
    Distributed to Poor Military Families and Impoverished People
    Xing County Government Council Resolution
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 2nd] The Xing County Government Council has decided to distribute 50,000 mu of church property from various temples and 80,000 mu of military reclamation land to landless and land-deficient military families and impoverished farmers for cultivation without compensation. It was also decided that the land returned to farmers would be contracted and deeded to establish permanent land rights for the tillers. The church property in the county was all seized from the people by various temples in the past through superstition. The Chongjiao Temple in the Second District alone controlled over 1,000 mu of mountain land and 260 mu of sloping land. The Longxing Temple in the Third District even used 500 shi of rent grain to issue usurious loans.

　　十三万亩庙地与部队开荒地
    分给贫苦军属与贫民
    兴县政务会决议
    【新华社晋绥二日电】兴县政务会决定将各寺庙之五万亩教产地，与八万亩部队开荒地，无代价分配给无地缺地之军属和贫苦农民耕种，并决定将归还农民之土地立约换契，确定耕者永久地权。该县教产地均为过去各寺庙依靠迷信向人民夺取的，仅二区崇教寺即把持千余亩山地、二百六十亩水坡地。三区之龙兴寺且以五百石租谷放高利贷。
