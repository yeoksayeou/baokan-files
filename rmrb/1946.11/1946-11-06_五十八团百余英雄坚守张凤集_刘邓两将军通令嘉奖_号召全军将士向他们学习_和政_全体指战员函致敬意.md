　　More Than One Hundred Heroes of the Fifty-Eighth Regiment Tenaciously Defend Zhangfengji
    Generals Liu and Deng Issue Circular of Commendation
    Calling on All Soldiers to Learn From Them
    All Officers and Soldiers of "Hezheng" Send Letters of Respect
    [Our Newspaper, Handan, 4th Dispatch] Commander Liu Bocheng and Political Commissar Deng Xiaoping of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region recently issued a circular to the entire army, commending the one hundred and eighty warriors of Zhangfengji, stating: In the battle of Zhangfengji, the one hundred and eighty men, led by Wu Zhong, commander of the Fifty-Eighth Regiment, demonstrated extraordinary bravery and tenacity. In extremely difficult circumstances and surrounded by the enemy, with only a little over a hundred men, they persistently held the positions within Zhangfengji village for a full day and night, enabling our army to achieve the victory of annihilating a large part of the invading Chiang Kai-shek's 32nd Regiment. They are worthy of being heroes and models of the people. In addition to expressing our respect to them, we hereby issue a circular to the entire army to commend them and call on all soldiers to learn from them.
    [Our Newspaper Reporter Group, 4th Dispatch] The headquarters of the "Hezheng" department on the Jin-Lu-Yu front recently issued a circular to its subordinates, praising the hundred heroes led by Commander Wu Zhong who tenaciously defended the northwest corner of Zhangfengji. The commander and political commissar of the "Hezheng" department, on behalf of all officers and soldiers, also sent letters of respect and condolences to the brotherly units who annihilated the enemy at Zhangfengji. The 16th issue of the "Self-Defense News" of the department published an editorial, calling on all to launch a "Learn From the Hundred Heroes Movement." The editorial first pointed out: In the breathtaking battle of Zhangfengji, which annihilated the American-equipped Chiang Kai-shek's troops, the decisive factor was Commander Wu and the hundred heroes. It continued: "This iron will and heroic and tenacious spirit have added brilliant glory to the history of our Eighth Route Army and set a model example." Finally, the editorial called on all units to learn the fighting spirit of the hundred heroes, "as stable as Mount Tai in defense, as fierce as a tiger in attack," and to greatly promote and develop it, and fight to the end to annihilate Chiang Kai-shek's troops.
    [Another Dispatch] In the Zhangfengji annihilation battle, the hundred heroes led by Commander Wu Zhong of our "Hezheng" department created a glorious battle example. The department's Forward Drama Troupe has rushed to the regiment to collect materials on the ground and write a script with the theme of the hundred heroes. The Political Department of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region has also sent Qian Haihong, a drama instructor from the cultural troupe, leading the drama group of the regiment to help with the work, and plans to allocate ten thousand yuan as a reward for the performance of the play. At present, promoting the Hundred Heroes Movement has become one of the important activities of front-line literary and artistic work.
