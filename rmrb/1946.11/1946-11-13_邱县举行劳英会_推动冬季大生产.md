Qiu County Holds Labor Hero Conference
    Promotes Winter Production Campaign
    [Our newspaper's report from Wei County on the 5th] In order to launch a winter sideline production campaign and lay the foundation for a large-scale production movement next year, Qiu County specially convened a county-wide Labor Hero Conference on October 23rd. New and old heroes gathered together, and Director Meng of the Administrative Office, Tang Yi, also came to provide guidance in person. Since the first Labor Hero Conference in Qiu County in 1944, a new batch of heroes has emerged in the past two years. Under the leadership of these new and old heroes, the people have overcome natural disasters and their lives are getting better and better. For example, the mutual aid group led by Cao Xiupei of Henzhuang in the Third District has increased its land by 143 mu, increased cattle by seven, and built two houses in the past two years. Each household has been transformed from a poor peasant to a middle peasant. This year's autumn wheat harvest yielded eight bags of grain per person and 1,000 jin of cotton per household, enough to last for two years. Under the leadership of Qin Yunsheng, all 32 households in Xiyao Sitou have transformed from poor to rich. This year's production results show that ten households have achieved "one surplus after cultivation," sixteen households have achieved "one surplus after two cultivations," and the remaining households have enough to eat and use for the whole year. Other heroes, such as Bian Xingjia of Renyizhuang and Yang Jixian of Nanchongzhuang, have led the masses to overcome natural disasters and become rich through production mutual aid.

    邱县举行劳英会
    推动冬季大生产
    【本报威县五日电】为开展冬季副业生产，打下明年大规模生产运动的基础，邱县特于十月二十三日召开全县劳动英雄大会，新老英雄群集一堂，行署孟主任夫唐亦亲临指导。邱县自四四年第一次劳英会后，两年来又涌出一批新的英雄，在新老英雄的领导下，人民渡过了灾荒，生活蒸蒸日上。如三区恒庄曹修培领导的互助组，两年来增地一顷四十三亩，增牛七头，宅子两处，每户都由贫农转为中农，今年秋麦收粮每人合八口袋，每户一千斤棉花，今年收的足够用两年。西姚四头在秦运生领导下，全村三十二户，皆由穷变富，今年生产结果有十户达到耕一余一，十六户达到耕二余一，其余户足够全年吃用。其他如仁义庄的边兴甲，南重庄的杨继先等英雄，都领导群众渡过了灾荒，用生产互助的办法发家致富。
