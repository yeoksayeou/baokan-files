Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th -- Renowned legal scholar Professor Chen Jinkun published a lengthy article in today's *Liberation Daily* entitled "Hypocritical Methods Cannot Deceive the People." Based on the will of the people and legal viewpoints, he exposed the deceptive nature of Chiang Kai-shek's statement regarding the "National Assembly meeting" and the so-called "cease-fire order," arguing that these are entirely illegal acts. Chen pointed out that the political resolutions jointly signed by Chiang Kai-shek and representatives of the Kuomintang with representatives of various parties and social figures at the Political Consultative Conference are a universally recognized great law by the people of the whole country. The National Government, Chiang Kai-shek, and the Kuomintang have a 100% obligation to abide by this, without any room for evasion or dissent. Why doesn't Chiang Kai-shek abide by it? People at home and abroad all know that it is because he wants to maintain his dictatorship and continue his autocracy. The Tutelage Constitution was created under the guise of public opinion and blatantly stipulated one-party dictatorship and one-man rule. The so-called "May 5th Draft Constitution" is essentially the same as the "Tutelage Constitution," also a blueprint for achieving dictatorial goals. Chen believes that Chiang Kai-shek's final tricks are convening the "National Assembly" and issuing the "cease-fire order." The former is the substance, the main text; the latter is the cover, the appendix. Although he changed a bit of his trickery, thinking he could deceive our people, our people are now smarter than before, and the Communist Party and other democratic armies are even smarter than before. They will never be easily deceived by Chiang Kai-shek again. His order, under "completely cease fighting," is immediately followed by "except for what is necessary to defend existing positions." This means that the cities he illegally occupied by attacking inside the passes in violation of the January 13th ceasefire agreement, and the cities he illegally occupied by attacking outside the passes in violation of the June 7th ceasefire agreement, must continue to be occupied by his subordinates. Moreover, they can attack at any time. This is precisely a complete and utter punitive expedition order. Professor Chen then commented on the motives and methods of Chiang Kai-shek's "National Assembly" trick, stating that Chiang Kai-shek is determined to continue his dictatorship and is anxious to be elected president. He has no choice but to learn from Yuan Shikai, who attempted to restore the monarchy under the Hongxian Empire, and once again engage in actions that run counter to historical trends when his days are numbered. This is the final act of China's despotic demon and dictatorial and evil politics. Chen revealed that the so-called "holding nationwide general elections" is, of course, predicated on the expectation that "the Communist Party can be eliminated" and "the liberated areas can be cleared" within six months after the meeting adjourns. It is also predicated on the expectation that the Communist Party and the Democratic League, etc., who are unwilling to participate in this National Assembly, will be unwilling to participate in the next National Assembly. The so-called "people of the whole country freely competing in elections" of course does not include the Communist Party, the Democratic League, and all democrats; if they participate in the "free elections," and "various parties submit opinions on amending the constitution according to law at the next National Assembly," that is simply surrendering and capitulating. I ask, will anyone with a modicum of integrity willingly suffer such the most dishonorable insult, now and in the future? Finally, Professor Chen declared: As a citizen, I would like to put forward the following points of view: (1) All our citizens should rise up and declare that the convening of this "National Assembly" and the enactment of the constitution and any other resolutions are invalid. (2) Other parties and non-party national figures should also make the above statement. (3) People's representatives in the liberated areas and national representatives elected or appointed from non-liberated areas should also make the above statement. (4) People's representatives in the liberated areas and other people's representatives should express that they will not participate in the National Assembly illegally and arbitrarily convened by Chiang Kai-shek. If a conference is convened in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference in the future, they will still participate. At the same time, they can unite, especially the national representatives elected by the people in the entire liberated area, who account for one-third of the total population of 140 million, to draft an appropriate constitutional draft so that the Communist Party or other parties can express true public opinion when it is submitted to the constitutional draft group, and prepare a proper constitutional draft. (5) The people of the whole country, especially the Communist Party and the Democratic League, etc., should express to the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom that Chiang Kai-shek openly undermines China's peaceful reunification and cooperation, violating the Three-Power Agreement; especially to the United States, they should express that Chiang Kai-shek dares to do this because he relies on American aid, and demand that the United States stop all aid, especially withdraw its troops stationed in China.

    陈瑾昆教授著文称：蒋贼虚伪手法骗不了人民
    召开“国大”下“停战令”都是非法行为
    是中国专制魔王独裁恶政的最后一幕
    【新华社延安十六日电】名法学家陈瑾昆教授今日以《虚伪的手法骗不了人民》为题，在解放日报上发表长文，根据人民意志及法律观点，揭露蒋介石关于“国大开会”声明与所谓“停战令”的欺骗性，认为这些都是完全非法行为。陈氏指出，蒋介石及国民党代表在政协会上与各党派代表和社会贤达所共同签订的政治各项决议，乃是全国人民公认的大法，这从国民政府同蒋介石并国民党来说，是只有百分之百遵守的义务，不能有丝毫推诿与异义的余地。蒋介石为什么不遵守呢？国内外人士全都知道是他要维持独裁，继续专制。训政约法是假借民意造成的，明目张胆的规定一党专政一人独裁，所谓“五五宪草”实与“训政约法”异曲而同工，也是达到专制独裁目的的蓝本。陈氏认为，蒋介石的最后手法是召开“国大”和下“停战令”。前者是本体，是正文；后者是掩护，是附文。他虽然变了一点戏法，以为可以欺骗我们人民，然而我们人民现在是比以前聪明了，中共和其他民主军队更是比以前聪明了，决不能轻轻再受蒋介石的欺骗。他的命令在“一律停止战斗”下还紧接一句“防守现地所必须者除外”，这就是说，他违反一月十三日停战协定进攻关内所得的城市，和违反六月七日停战协定进攻关外所得的城市都要他的部下各个继续占领；而且，随时可以进攻。这正是一个地地道道的讨伐令。陈教授继即评述蒋介石这次“国大”戏法的动机和手法称：蒋介石是决心的要继续独裁，情急的要当选总统，只得更学洪宪帝制的袁世凯，再在民国历史上来一次日暮途穷倒行逆施，这也就是中国专制魔王和独裁恶政的最后的一幕。陈氏揭露，所谓“举行全国普选”，当然是预计在闭会后六个月内可以将“共产党消灭”，“解放区扫平”；更是预计不愿参加此次国民大会的共产党和民主同盟等是不愿参加下届国民大会。所谓“全国人民届时自由竞选”，当然不包括共产党和民主同盟和一切民主人士等在内；他们若参加“自由竞选”，并由“各党派在下届国民大会对于宪法依法提出修改宪法意见”，那只是屈服投降。试问稍有人格的人，现在和将来是否甘受这种最不名誉的侮辱？最后陈教授声称：我以一个国民的资格，要提出下列的几点意见：（一）凡我国民都应起来表示此次“国民大会”开会同制宪与其他任何决议都是无效。（二）其他党派与无党派的全国人士也应作上项表示。（三）解放区内人民的国民代表和其他非解放区所选出或派定的国民代表也应为上项表示。（四）解放区内人民代表和其他人民代表都应表示不参加蒋介石违法擅自召开的国民大会，将来如果依政协决议召开大会，仍然参加。同时，并可以联合，尤其全解放区占一万万四千万人口全人口三分之一的人民选出的国民代表联合，拟定适当宪草以备中共或其他党派在宪草小组提出时得以表现真正民意，准备正当宪草。（五）全国人民，尤其共产党和民主同盟等，应向美苏英表示蒋介石公然破坏中国和平统一合作，违反三国协定；尤其向美国表示，蒋介石敢于如此做是因为倚仗美国援助，要求美国停止一切援助，尤其撤退在华驻军。
