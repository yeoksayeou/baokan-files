Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 5th: Beiping dispatch: The atrocities of the American military stationed in Beiping and Tianjin are escalating. According to newspaper reports alone, six incidents occurred in the two cities within five days from the 23rd to the 28th, resulting in thirteen Chinese casualties, averaging almost three deaths or injuries per day. On the evening of the 23rd, a sentry from the American military stationed at the Shixin Village post outside the Tianjin Hedong Railway Eastern Bureau, shot and killed a fifteen or sixteen-year-old Chinese youth for no reason. Late on the night of the 24th, two American military police officers in Beiping, driving a jeep with a Chinese prostitute, were laughing hysterically and driving at high speed. While passing the @Chang Coal Store entrance on Suzhou Hutong inside Chongwenmen, they crashed into a rickshaw and a pedicab, destroying them. The jeep crashed directly into the @Chang Coal Store, causing the house to collapse. The pedicab driver, Wang Yulong, suffered a broken leg and internal injuries, leading to his death. The rickshaw driver, Luo Xicun, suffered a large laceration on his head, with one eye protruding, and is in critical condition. The passenger, Liu Yusheng, suffered a head injury. Six coal store employees were injured by the debris. On the evening of the 27th, traffic police officer Ma Deli from the 6th Precinct of the Beiping Public Security Bureau, was on duty at the traffic post at the intersection outside Xizhimen, when an American jeep suddenly crashed into him from behind, causing severe injuries. On the afternoon of the 28th, Gu Zhaohai, a fourth-year student in the Department of Political Economy at China University, was knocked down on West Chang'an Avenue by an American 65676 truck that violated traffic rules. He suffered severe injuries to both legs, facial lacerations, and lost two front teeth, with blood streaming down his face. That same afternoon, American truck number 87700 in Beiping crushed the bicycle of Ma Xiangzhi, a shop assistant at Baohe Lou Gold Store, at the west entrance of Chedan Santiao, fortunately without injuring him. On the afternoon of the same day, American military police in Tianjin, on the Hai River bank, inexplicably picked up Zhang Shan, a coolie from the Tianjin Wharf in Dawangzhuang, Hedong, and threw him into the Hai River. Fortunately, he was rescued and did not drown.
