　　Congratulations on the Great Victory on the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Front
　　On the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Front, our Hebei-Shandong-Henan People's Liberation Army, with the force of a thunderbolt from October 29th to 31st, annihilated one and a half strong infantry brigades and two artillery battalions of Liu Ruming's troops of the Chiang army who invaded our Juancheng in one fell swoop. According to the prisoners' description of the situation at the time: "When we discovered that we had been surrounded by the superior Communist army, we had no possibility of breaking through." It can be seen how rapid and mobile our army's operations are. This is the fourth great victory of our main force on the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Front after the Juye campaign. So far, our main force on the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Front has completed the glorious task of annihilating eight enemy brigades and made a great contribution to the patriotic self-defense war. We would like to extend our cordial greetings to the officers and soldiers of the field army on the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Front, as well as the local corps, guerrillas, work teams, and militias!
　　The new victory on the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Front once again proves that the situation of the Chiang army's inevitable defeat and our army's inevitable victory has been determined.
　　The reactionaries have launched a large-scale invasion of our region for more than three and a half months. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and its wise leader Comrade Mao Zedong, all the army and people in our Hebei-Shandong-Henan region have worked together with one heart and mind to complete the great creation of annihilating more than thirteen enemy brigades. According to statistics, those annihilated include: two brigades of the 3rd and 20th brigades of Chiang's direct line of the 1st Reorganized Division, one and a half brigades of the 1st brigade and parts of the 167th brigade and 78th brigade of the 1st Division, the main force of the 31st brigade of the 27th Division, two brigades of the 18th brigade directly under the 11th Reorganized Division and the 32nd regiment of the 11th brigade, two brigades of the 29th brigade of the 55th Division and parts of the 74th brigade and 81st brigade of Liu Ruming's troops, more than two brigades of the 119th brigade, 181st brigade and part of the 143rd brigade of the 68th Division, one and a half brigades of the 122nd brigade and part of the 124th brigade of the Sichuan Army's 41st Division, more than one brigade of the entire 127th brigade and part of the 125th brigade of the 47th Division, one brigade of the main force of the 17th brigade and part of the 177th brigade of the Shaanxi Army's 38th Division, and parts of the 39th Division of the Yan Army's 69th Division and the 44th Division and 45th Division (not reorganized), totaling more than thirteen brigades. This number accounts for about 7% of the 180-odd brigades of the reactionary invading forces. Among them, more than eleven brigades were annihilated in the first three months of the patriotic self-defense war, and the other two brigades were annihilated in the past half month. The annihilation of a large number of enemies has greatly encouraged the victory confidence of the army and people in the entire region, and has also greatly increased the sense of failure among the vast number of officers and soldiers in the reactionary army. Even their senior officers said: "This kind of army is something I have never seen in the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War. Its firepower is similar to ours, and its tenacious spirit is something we cannot compare with at all." Our army will become stronger and stronger as we fight, and our equipment will become better and better as we fight. More and more officers and soldiers of the Chiang army will join our army. In the past three months, 25,000 people have joined our army. In addition, we have gotten rid of the burden on some cities and transportation lines, and our main force is more mobile and can advance and retreat in big steps, giving the enemy annihilation blows and laying the foundation for our major counter-offensive.
　　In the past three and a half months, the reactionary forces have used 50 brigades, including special corps, about 400,000 to 500,000 people, to attack our region, accounting for about 28% of their total deployed forces. In more than three months, at the cost of thirteen brigades, they occupied 25 empty cities of ours, and the vast rural areas are still under our control. They are forced to use more than half of the nearly 30 brigades to defend these cities, averaging more than one brigade to defend an empty city, while their rear is extremely empty, far away from the railway line, and the transportation line is often cut off. The huge supply has encountered serious difficulties. In addition, there is an extreme lack of troop replenishment and reserve forces, and the troop strength is extremely insufficient. Two months ago, they only scraped together three brigades from the Central Plains front. During this period, almost no new reserves were drawn in. The mobile forces are becoming less and less. There are only six or seven brigades on the eastern front, six or seven brigades on the western front, and three or four brigades in northern Henan. The reactionary forces have no way to overcome this contradiction, which has become one of its fatal weaknesses. It is precisely for this reason that the reactionary forces had to re-deploy the main force of Liu Ruming's troops, which had suffered heavy losses and were exhausted, to launch an offensive again, which ultimately led to the annihilation of the entire army and a disastrous defeat. In the future, this kind of disastrous defeat will continue to be staged and cannot be avoided.
　　What do we mainly rely on to achieve this victory? We rely on an invincible force: that is, all our army and people have an unwavering confidence in winning the just patriotic self-defense war, and are closely united around the CCP Central Committee and Chairman Mao. In any difficulty and danger, we do not panic, but can remain calm and unhurried, bravely sacrifice and fight against difficulties, reverse the situation, and open up the road to victory; in victory, we are not arrogant and complacent, but can be conscientious, thrifty, and unremittingly strive.
　　The reason why we have achieved this victory also depends on our resolute implementation of the combat method of concentrating superior forces to annihilate the enemy advocated by Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. Repeated battles have proved that those who implement this method will surely win, and those who adopt the tactics of fighting recklessly will surely fail. The victory on the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Front this time is the correct application of this guiding principle, so we can surprise the enemy and annihilate the enemy completely in 48 hours and win the victory. It also depends on the resolute implementation of the instruction that the tillers have their land. War mobilization is carried out on the basis of thoroughly implementing land reform. Land reform and war mobilization are not contradictory but are closely combined. Wherever this instruction is implemented, the consciousness of the broad masses is further improved, the armed forces are more powerful, and participation in the war and joining the army are more enthusiastic. In the past three months, we have conducted two war mobilizations in places where land reform has been completed and the tillers have their land. Nearly 100,000 liberated peasant youths have gone to the front line to join the main force corps. Without this condition, we could not imagine that we could win four battles and maintain an invincible position on the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Front. It also depends on the widespread development of mass guerrilla warfare. In the three and a half months of struggle, what has tied down more than 20 enemy brigades and made them unable to move? What has guaranteed the wide maneuverability of our main force? This is mass guerrilla warfare. Now guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines is developing vigorously. We call on more outstanding cadres and party members to go behind enemy lines to continue to strengthen this struggle. It also depends on the full support of the rear for the front line. The people's participation in the war, mobilization, stretcher transportation, etc., are all extremely enthusiastic. In one battle on the Longhai Railway, 270,000 people participated, which was truly a thrilling scene. The rear serves the front line, and all factories, mines, transportation teams, cooperatives, etc., are working at an unprecedented pace, all for the purpose of winning the victory on the front line. Without this great nationwide war participation movement, it would be difficult for us to imagine that we would achieve such continuous victories. The problem lies in the fact that we need to do more accurate and scientific calculations and organization work in the future, so that manpower, materials, and financial resources can be used appropriately, without extravagance or waste, in order to persist in a long-term war. As long as we do the above work better, further improve the combat effectiveness of the local corps, guerrillas, and militias, thoroughly implement land reform, further develop the Gao Shuxun movement, further improve the work of returning wounded soldiers to the team and consolidating the troops, and continue to improve military industrial production, we can expect our victories to be even greater.
　　The new victory on the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Front is the beginning of our region annihilating the second ten brigades. As long as we annihilate a few more ten brigades, we will definitely be able to recover all the lost territory in our region. Striving to complete the annihilation of the second ten brigades is the common task of the party, government, army, and people in our entire region. We must be tense, united, have firm confidence, and work together to promote its realization!

### 祝冀鲁豫前线大捷

　　祝冀鲁豫前线大捷
    冀鲁豫前线我晋冀鲁豫人民解放军，于十月二十九日至三十一日，以雷霆万钧之势，一举歼灭进犯我鄄城之蒋军刘汝门部步兵一个半旅强及两个炮兵营。据俘虏描述当时情形称：“当我们发现已被优势的共军包围时，我们已没有任何可能突围了”。我军作战之神速与机动可知。这是冀鲁豫前线我主力军继巨野战役后第四次大捷，至此我们冀鲁豫前线主力已完成了歼敌八个旅的光荣任务，对爱国自卫战争作了伟大贡献，谨向冀鲁豫前线野战军的将士们、与地方兵团游击队、武工队、民兵们致以亲切的慰问！
    冀鲁豫前线新的胜利，再次证明蒋军必败我军必胜的局面是定下来了。
    反动派大举向我区进犯，已逾三个半月，我晋冀鲁豫区，在中国共产党及其英明领袖毛泽东同志领导下，全体军民协力同心，团结一致，已完成了歼敌十三个旅以上的伟大创作，统计被歼者有：蒋嫡系整一师第三第二○旅两个旅，第一师第一旅及一六七旅七十八旅各一部共一个半旅，廿七师三十一旅主力，整十一师十八旅直属队及十一旅三十二团共两个旅，刘汝明部五五师二九旅及七四旅八一旅各一部共两个旅，六十八师一一九旅一八一旅及一四三旅一部共两个旅强，川军四一师一二二旅及一二四旅一部计一个半旅，四七师一二七旅全部及一二五旅一部共一个旅强，陕军三八师十七旅主力一七七旅一部共一个旅，阎军六十九师三九师及四四师四五师一部（未整编）等合计十三个旅以上。这个数目约占反动派全部进犯部队一百八十几个旅的百分之七弱，其中十一个多旅是在爱国自卫战争的前三个月歼灭的，另两个旅则在近半个月歼灭的，大量敌人的被歼，大大鼓舞了全区军民的胜利信心，也大大增加了反动派军队中广大官兵的失败情绪，甚至其高级军官说：“这种军队为我在抗战八年中所未见，火力与我们差不多，顽强精神是我们根本不能比拟的”。我军将愈战愈强，装备愈打愈好。蒋军官兵参加我军的将愈来愈多，三个月中参加我军者即有两万五千人，加之我们已摆脱了对某些城市和交通线的负担，主力更加机动自如，可以大踏步的进退，给敌人以歼灭打击，奠立了我们大反攻的基础。
    反动派三个半月来用于进攻我区的兵力达五十个旅，连特种兵团在内约四五十万人，占其全部出动兵力的百分之二十八。三个多月时间，以十三个旅的代价，占领了我们二十五座空城，广大乡村仍控制在我们手里。他被迫要用一半以上将近三十个旅的兵力来守备这些城市，平均要以一个多旅的兵力守一个空城，而其后方极度空虚，距铁路线日远，交通线时被切断，浩繁的补给已遭遇严重的困难，加之兵员补充与后备兵力极度缺乏，兵力极感不足，两个月前东凑西凑只从中原前线抽来了三个旅，这一个时期，几乎没有抽来一点新的后备了，机动兵力愈来愈少，在东线只六七个旅，西线六七个旅，豫北三四个旅，反动派对于这一矛盾已毫无办法克服，成为它致命的弱点之一。正因为这个原因，反动派不得不将损失巨大，疲备不堪的刘汝明部主力，重新投入进攻，终致全军覆没，惨遭失败。将来这种惨败，必将不断演出，无法逃避。
    我们取得这种胜利，主要依靠什么呢？依靠一种无敌的力量：就是我们全体军民对争取正义的爱国自卫战争具有坚定不移的胜利信心，紧紧的团结在中共中央及毛主席的周围，在任何困难和危急时不惊惶失措，而能镇定裕如，英勇牺牲与困难作斗争，扭转局势，开辟胜利的道路；在胜利时则不骄傲自满而能兢兢业业，克勤克俭，奋斗不懈。
    我们之所以取得这种胜利，还依靠我们坚决执行了毛主席朱总司令的集中优势力量歼敌的作战方法。历次作战证明，凡执行了这个方法的一定胜利，凡采牛抵角战术的一定失败。这次冀鲁豫前线的胜利就是对这一指导原则的正确运用，故能出敌不意，四十八小时内使敌人全部就歼，获得胜利；还依靠坚决贯彻了耕者有其田的指示，是在彻底实行土地改革的基础上进行战争动员，不是土地改革和战争动员相矛盾而恰恰是密切的结合，凡贯彻了这指示的地方，广大群众的觉悟性更加提高，武装更有力量，参战参军更加踊跃。三个月中我们在土地改革已经完成耕者有其田已经实现的地方作了两次参军动员，将近十万解放的农民青年，走上了前线参加主力兵团。没有这个条件，我们不可能设想我们能在冀鲁豫前线四战四捷保持常胜不败之地；还依靠群众游击战争的广泛开展，三个半月来的斗争，什么东西束缚住敌人廿多个旅使之陷于点线不能机动？什么东西保证了我们主力军宽大机动呢？这就是群众游击战争，现在敌后游击战争已在猛烈的发展，我们号召更多的优秀干部和党员到敌后去继续加强这一斗争。还依靠后方的全力支援前线，人民参战动员担架运输等均异常热烈，陇海一次作战中，参战人员曾出动过廿七万人，这真是惊心动魄的场面，后方为前方服务，各工厂各矿山各运输队合作社等均空前紧张的工作，目的都是为了争取前线的胜利。没有这种伟大全民参战运动，我们也很难设想我们会取得这样连续的胜利，问题是在于我们今后需要作更精确的科学的计算与组织工作，使人力物力财力能恰如其分的使用，不铺张不浪费以坚持长期战争。只要我们把以上工作做得更好，把地方兵团游击队民兵的战斗力更加提高，土地改革彻底贯彻，高树勋运动更加开展，伤员归队和部队巩固工作更加完善，军工生产继续改进，我们可以预计我们的胜利将更大更多。
    冀鲁豫前线新的胜利是我区歼灭第二个十个旅的开始，只要我们再歼灭它几个十个旅，我们一定可以收复我区全部失地，为完成歼灭第二个十个旅而奋斗是我全区党政军民的共同任务，我们必须紧张，团结，坚定信心，共同努力，促其实现！
