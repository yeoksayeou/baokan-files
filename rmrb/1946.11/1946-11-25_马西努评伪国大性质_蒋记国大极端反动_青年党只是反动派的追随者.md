　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 22nd: Moscow Radio broadcast yesterday a commentary by Soviet commentator Masinu entitled "On the Nature of the Chinese National Assembly." The commentary stated: "The nature of this National Assembly is beyond doubt; it cannot represent the Chinese people. Chinese democrats and their newspapers have protested, pointing out that the representatives to the National Assembly were merely appointed by the Kuomintang. Foreign observers who maintain a detached attitude also make the same assessment. The Times of London reported on the 15th that the National Assembly is regarded as a meeting representing the Kuomintang, and its passage is a nominal pseudo-constitutional conference. Time and Life magazine reporter White said that the National Assembly representatives were selected in 1936, and no open elections have been held anywhere in China. White pointed out that Chiang Kai-shek wanted such representatives to formulate a constitution and decide the fate of China, which completely ignores the great struggle that the entire Chinese people have been involved in over the past decade. This decade has produced many important new tasks, and these old representatives have never represented anyone except the most reactionary elements of the Kuomintang." The commentary pointed out: "The participation of the Chinese Youth Party in the National Assembly cannot change the assessment of the National Assembly. Chinese society knows the true face of the Youth Party. Chinese newspapers and magazines, as well as the Kuomintang Military Intelligence Bureau, in the book 'Various Small Parties in China' distributed at the Second Plenary Session of the party, all stated that the Youth Party has always had close ties with the most reactionary warlords. During the War of Resistance, the Central Committee members of the Youth Party held important positions in the government, and Zeng Qi had close contacts with the great traitor Liang Hongzhi. During the Political Consultative Conference, the Youth Party received a subsidy of 10 million yuan from the Kuomintang authorities, and then received a subsidy of 50 million yuan to run newspapers in various places to help the Kuomintang speak." The commentary stated: "The actions of the Youth Party reveal that they are the main spokespersons for the Kuomintang reactionaries in the country. Now the democratic front will be more consolidated without the Youth Party, and the leadership organs of the Youth Party have also split. Therefore, the participation of the Youth Party in the National Assembly will not change the non-representative and anti-people nature of this National Assembly in the slightest."

　　马西努评伪国大性质
    蒋记国大极端反动
    青年党只是反动派的追随者
    【新华社延安廿二日电】昨日莫斯科电台广播：苏联评论员马西努“论中国国民大会的性质”。该评论说：这个国民大会的性质，是无可怀疑的，它不能代表中国人民。中国民主人士及其报纸纷纷抗议，指出国大的代表只是国民党委派的。抱着旁观态度的外国观察家亦作同样估计，英国泰晤士报记者十五日报导说，国大被认是代表国民党的会议，它通过是有名无实的伪立宪会议。美国时代、生活杂志记者怀特说，国大代表是一九三六年进行的，在中国任何地方都没有进行过公开的选举。怀特指出蒋介石要这样的代表来制定宪法，解决中国命运，运是完全忽视了十年来全中国人民曾卷入了伟大斗争，这十年内产生了许多重大的新任务，这些旧代表除代表国民党最反动的分子外，从来没有代表过任何人。该评论指出：中国青年党参加国大，这点绝不能改变对国大的估计，中国社会人士深知青年党的真面貌中国的报纸杂志，以至国民党军统局在该党二中全会所散发的“中国各小党”一书，都说明青年党从来就是与最反动的军阀有密切连络。在抗战中，青年党的中委在政府任要职，而曾琦则与大汉奸梁鸿志往来甚密。政协会时，青年党受过国民党当局的一万万元津贴，随后在各地办报，又接获五万万元津贴，帮助国民党说话。该评论称：青年党的行动，揭露了他们是国民党反动派在国内主要的代言人，现在民主阵线没有青年党将更加巩固起来，而青年党的领导机关也发生了分裂，因此青年党之参加国大，对这个国大的非代表及反人民性质绝不会有丝毫改变。
