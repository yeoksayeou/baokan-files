Xinhua News Agency, Central China, October 30th: (Delayed Dispatch) On the evening of the 30th, a unit of the New Fourth Army, taking advantage of the dim moonlight, launched a counterattack against the remnants of the Kuomintang 74th Division, besieged in the Lianshui County area, south of the Yu Huang River, between Jiaoling and Qinggong. After a day and night of fierce fighting, they immediately recovered Jiaoling Town in the southeast of Lianshui, as well as more than ten villages and towns, large and small, such as Zhangjiayao and Tangjiagou. A part of the Kuomintang army was annihilated and captured, and the victory was used to pursue the Kuomintang army retreating to the Huangzhuang-Qinggong line, and the results are being expanded.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, November 1st: Militia and guerrilla forces in the First District of Jiangsu and Anhui launched widespread attacks while the Kuomintang army was making a full-scale northern invasion of Dongtai. In mid-October, they successively removed sixteen Kuomintang strongholds on the Ru (Gao) - Huang (Qiao) line, including Banjing, Xiejiadian, and Jiali City; on the Tai (Xing) - Huang (Qiao) line, including Hetouzhuang, Shijiabao, Jiangjiadai, Wengjiazhuang, Shilidian, Wulidun, and Zhangjiakeng; on the Kou (An) - Tai (Xing) line, including Maojiaqun and Jiatougou; and on the Jing (Jiang) - Tai (Xing) line, including Bishu City and Zhangjiaqiao. By this point, the 130-mile-long highway along the river from Xingang (East of Jingjiang) in the east to Kouan (Northwest of Taixing) in the west, and the 120-mile-long highway traversing the First District from Rugao to Taixing, as well as the highways formed by the Ru (Gao) - Tai (Xing) and Jing (Jiang) - Huang (Qiao) roads, with the exception of the three county towns of Taixing, Jingjiang, and Rugao, and a few isolated strongholds such as Huangqiao, Kouan, and Jijia City, have all been liberated again. The two lines of Ru (Gao) - Xin (Shenggang) and Jing (Jiang) - Xin (Gang) have always been under the control of the people. Since mid-September, the Kuomintang army has dispatched 15,000 troops, attempting to open up these lines, but all have failed, suffering losses of more than 700 people.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, November 1st: On the evening of the 25th of last month, a unit of the New Fourth Army launched a self-defense counterattack against the Kuomintang-puppet strongholds of Shangfang Street, Pingming Street, and Wafangji in the southwest of Haizhou, west of Guanyun. The battle ended on the morning of the 27th. It annihilated parts of the 25th Brigade (formerly the division) of the 57th Division (formerly the 98th Army) of the Kuomintang army and the puppet bandit Xu Jitai's troops, totaling more than 200 people (including more than 120 captured alive). It captured two light machine guns and more than 100 rifles. The above three strongholds and large areas of lost territory south of the Puyang River and west of the Rose River were recovered.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, November 1st: After suffering a head-on blow from the invading Kuomintang army in Lianshui, the Kuomintang army in Lianghuai was extremely panicked, and transported more than 3,000 wounded soldiers to Xuzhou along the Grand Canal via Siyang and Suqian overnight.
