　　The United States Congress
    November 5th was the date of the US Senate elections. The United States Congress is divided into the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Senate was established primarily to reconcile the contradictions between the bourgeoisie of the North and the agriculturalists and planters of the South, because each state has two senators, while the House of Representatives has one representative for every 30,000 people. Senators serve six-year terms, and representatives serve two-year terms. This year, all 435 representatives are up for re-election. In addition to the 32 senators up for re-election according to regulations, there were four senators who resigned or died, making a total of 36 senators up for re-election.
    In the last (79th) Congress, the Democratic Party held 56 seats in the Senate, the Republican Party held 40 seats, and the Progressive Party held one seat. In the House of Representatives, the Democratic Party held 242 seats, the Republican Party held 190 seats, and the Progressive and Labor Parties each held one seat.
    The Vice President serves as the President of the Senate. In the absence of the Vice President, a President Pro Tempore is elected (as when Truman ascended to the presidency, and then McKellar succeeded him). The Speaker of the House of Representatives is elected by all members of the House, and is undoubtedly a member of the majority party.
    Congress meets at least once a year, starting on January 3rd of each year. There is no explicit provision as to how long the session will last, meaning that it is within the session until the next meeting begins on January 3rd of the following year. This Congress adjourned as early as August 1st because the members had to return to their hometowns to campaign. If necessary, the President may convene a special session of Congress.
    A bill passed by Congress must be approved and signed by the President to become law; if the President vetoes it, it can also become law if it is repassed by a two-thirds majority.
    The United States Congress has been controlled by the Democratic and Republican parties from the beginning. Since the end of the 19th century, due to the development of capitalism in the southern states, the boundaries between the two parties have been eliminated, and they can both be political parties representing the bourgeoisie. However, there are still progressive and reactionary factions, enlightened and conservative factions within the two parties, so this election of members of Congress is actually a struggle between democratic forces and reactionary forces.

　　美国国会
    十一月五日，是美国参议员选举的日子。美国国会分为参众两院，参议院主要是为了调和北方的资产阶级与南方的农业者与垦殖者的矛盾而设立的，因参院议员每州二人，而众院议员则为每三万人选一人。参议员任期六年，众议员任期二年，今年众议员四三五人全部改选。参议员除依规定改选三十二人外，还有四个议员辞职或死亡，一共改选三十六人。
    上届（七十九届）国会中，民主党在参院占五十六名，共和党四十名，进步党一名。众院中民主党二四二名，共和党一九○名，进步与劳工党各一名。
    参院议长由副总统兼，副总统缺席时即推一临时主席（如现时杜鲁门升任总统，即推麦克勒继任）。众院议长则由全体议员选举，无疑是多数党的议员当选。
    国会每年至少开会一次，日期为每年一月三日，至会期多久，并无明文规定，意思就是说到次年一月三日下次会议开始前，都在会期之内。此次国会因各议员须回乡竞选，早在八月一日即行休会。如有必要，总统得召开国会特别会议。
    国会通过的法案，须得总统批准签署，始能成为法律；如总统否决，则须有三分之二的多数复行通过，亦可成为法律。
    美国国会一开始就被民主共和两党所把持，而这两党自十九世纪末，由于南方诸州的资本主义发展，两党界限即已消除，即可同为代表资产阶级的政党，不过两党内部仍有进步派与反动派之分，开明与保守之别，所以这次议员的选举，实为民主力量与反动力量的斗争。
