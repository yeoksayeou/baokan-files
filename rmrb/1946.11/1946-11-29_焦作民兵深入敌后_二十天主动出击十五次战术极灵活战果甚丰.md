　　Jiaozuo Militia Penetrates Deep Behind Enemy Lines
    Twenty Days of Active Engagement with Fifteen Raids, Extremely Flexible Tactics, Abundant Results
    [Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] Since the Chiang army occupied Jiaozuo City in early October, the people's armed forces in the Jiaozuo urban area have launched extensive guerrilla warfare, penetrating deep behind enemy lines to engage the enemy, capturing and ambushing them, carrying out explosions, resisting grain grabbing, and other actions, inflicting blows on the enemy everywhere. In one month, the Jiaozuo militia achieved considerable results in their attacks, especially winning the approval and support of the broad masses. According to a summary, in twenty days, we took the initiative to attack fifteen times, killing six enemies (not including those killed by landmines), capturing twenty local Kuomintang secret agents and special agents (not including those captured by the Public Security Bureau), seizing nine rifles, two livestock, one telephone, one map, ten blankets, two hundred catties of sea salt, and recovering grain, with over three hundred shi from Zhimaocha alone. On the 28th, our ×× squad laid two landmines on the northern ground of Lifeng Village and on the highway, destroying one enemy vehicle and many other miscellaneous supplies. This made the enemy uneasy day and night. At the sound of gunfire, the lights were quickly extinguished all night long, and they spread rumors among themselves, saying: "There are landmines everywhere in the mountains, and the Eighth Route Army has set up a landmine network, so we dare not walk around randomly." On the contrary, the Jiaozuo militia are becoming stronger and stronger as they fight. They have now put forward the slogan: "Get one when one comes out, and we will definitely fight back to Jiaozuo."

　　焦作民兵深入敌后
    二十天主动出击十五次战术极灵活战果甚丰
    【本报特讯】自蒋军十月上旬陷我焦作市后，焦作市区人民武装展开了广泛的游击战，深入背后接敌捕捉伏击、爆炸、反抢粮等运动，使敌到处受到打击。在一月中我焦市民兵出击取得不小战果，特别是取得广大群众赞同、拥助。据综合二十天内我主动出击十五次，毙敌六名，（地雷炸死不在内）捕捉当地还乡团奸特二十名（公安局捕捉不在内），缴获步枪九枝，牲口两头，电话机一架，地图一幅，被毯十条，海盐二百斤，抢回粮食只毛岔一地有三百余石。二十八日我××小队在李封村北地和公路上埋设地雷爆炸两颗，炸毁敌汽车一辆，其它零碎物资甚多。使敌昼夜不安，一听枪响，灯火迅速整夜熄灭，互相传说着：“山上到处是地雷，八路设有地雷网，可不敢乱走。”相反的，焦作民兵则愈战愈强。他们现在又提出口号：“出来一个弄一个，一定打回焦作去”。
