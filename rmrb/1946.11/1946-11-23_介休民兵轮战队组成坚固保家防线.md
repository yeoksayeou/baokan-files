　　Jiexiu First and Second District militia rotation teams, using the natural barriers on the mountains from Jiaosi to Wanghe in the local area, have established a solid defense line to protect their homes. They have also bravely repelled invading enemies many times, guarding the gateways to this defense line – Nanpo Village and Shangxichu Village. After breakfast on the sixth of last month, a regiment of enemies from Hongshan set out, divided into two groups of about five or six hundred people each, with two hundred reactionary landlord "Struggle Corps" members as guides. One group advanced towards Nanpo, and the other towards Shangxichu, in an encirclement attack, attempting to enter the mountainous areas of the First and Second Districts to loot grain on a large scale. The First and Second District rotation teams, standing firm on the defense line, in coordination with the county's Public Security Team, immediately launched a brave self-defense battle against the enemy. After holding out for half an hour, they retreated towards Shengguan Yu, contacted the Wanghe rotation team, and then divided their forces into two routes to counter-encircle the enemy. The Wanghe rotation team was on the right flank, attacking Shangxichu, and the Jiexiu First and Second District rotation teams were on the left flank, attacking Beipo Village, ambushing the enemy. The enemy, caught off guard by this unexpected interception, fought until 2 p.m., already exhausted. The rotation teams seized the opportunity to pursue them down the mountain, and the enemy fled in a panic towards Fanwang and its vicinity. The militia then pursued their victory, killing two enemies, intercepting four donkeys and more than three *shi* of wheat from Nanpo Village, and rescuing three captured youths. The militia's morale was further boosted, and they repelled the enemy's attacks on the seventh and eighth days in a row, killing a total of nine enemies and capturing four enemy scouts alive, protecting three to four hundred *shi* of public grain from being looted by the enemy. To this day, the rotation team still stands firm on the defense line.
