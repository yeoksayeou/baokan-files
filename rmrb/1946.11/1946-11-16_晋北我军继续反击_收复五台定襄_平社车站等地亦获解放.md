Xinhua News Agency, Northern Tongpu Front, 13th: After recovering Yuanping, Sanjiao, and Guoxian, the Eighth Route Army in northern Shanxi recovered Wutai, Dingxiang, Pingshe, Dongye and other places in the early part of this month. In late October, more than 2,000 Yan’s troops from Xin County invaded in multiple directions, successively occupying Dingxiang, Yuanping, Guoxian, and Wutai. The local military and civilians rose up in counter-attack, recovering Guoxian, Sanjiao, Yuanping, and other places occupied by Yan's troops in one day. Continuing to expand the self-defense counter-offensive, they recovered Wutai County on the 5th, and on the 6th, they uprooted Pingshe Station (30 miles south of Xin County), an important stronghold of Yan's troops on the Tongpu Road. At this time, the 29th and 37th divisions of Yan's troops occupying Dingxiang and Dongye were attacked from both sides. Under the continuous harassment and attacks by the local military and civilians, they abandoned Dingxiang City on the 8th and fled to Xin County. The above two towns were then recovered. The results of the battle are currently being tallied.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui Border Region, 12th: Guerrilla units and militia of the Eighth Route Army in southwestern Shanxi recently launched a struggle to protect able-bodied men. On October 27th, three regiments of Yan's 70th Division from Fenyang advanced towards an area 30 miles west of Fenyang, and were defeated by the guerrillas, who killed or wounded more than 60 of them. At the beginning of this month, Yan's troops from Fenyang again shifted their forces to advance along the Taiyuan-Fenyang Highway. On the 6th, more than 1,000 Yan's troops occupied Luo Township and other places, and went to Dongyaozhuang, 30 miles northeast of the city, to loot grain, but were repelled by the militia. The militia around Zhongyang City killed or wounded 16 Yan's soldiers and captured three alive with landmine explosions in October, rescuing more than 100 captured able-bodied men. More than 20 of them immediately took landmines and grenades and joined the encirclement of Yan's stronghold. Last month, the militia near Jiaocheng fought more than 40 times independently against Yan's troops looting grain, killing or wounding 18 of them, capturing another 20, and rescuing more than 200 captured youths.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui Border Region, 12th: The local armed forces of the Eighth Route Army in Huo County, Lingshi, Fenxi, and Xi County in central Shanxi shattered three "large-scale mopping-up operations" by the Yan-puppet troops in June, July, August, September, and October, engaging in 203 battles, capturing 645 Yan's soldiers, killing 644, seizing 601 rifles, 39 light and heavy machine guns, and more than 26,000 rounds of ammunition, and expanding the liberated areas, establishing democratic governments, and increasing the size of the troops fivefold.
