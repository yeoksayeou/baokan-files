　　Changzhi City Organizes People's Court
    Executes Chiang Kai-shek Special Agent Li Lianquan
    [Our Newspaper Changzhi News] Changzhi City organized a People's Court on the 13th to publicly try the Chiang Kai-shek special agent "Loyal Righteousness Build the Nation Army" conspiracy to riot case. At the meeting, Li Haiquan and Zhang Yanxing painfully recounted how they went astray, joined the "Loyal Righteousness Build the Nation Army," and harmed the liberated areas. The masses, considering their thorough confession and repentance, approved their release on bail. Ma Guisui was detained for further education due to insufficient frankness. When Li Runchun was brought for interrogation, many people pointed at him and questioned his heinous crimes. Even Li's brother, Li Lianquan, pointed at him and said with hatred: "I was tricked by him into joining the secret service. I went to Changzi Tunliu to deliver letters and spread rumors to persuade the targets of struggle to leave." Special agent Li Runchun, unable to deny the facts, admitted everything. The entire audience was extremely indignant, shouting: "Resolutely eliminate special agents, defend the fruits of our liberation!" and demanding that the government suppress the heinous special agent Li Runchun. The democratic government accepted the people's will, and Deputy Mayor Huo announced on the spot that special agent Li Runchun was sentenced to death and executed by firing squad.

    [Further News] The day before the public trial of special agent Li Runchun, the masses in East and West Streets respectively held meetings to publicly try Yan Xishan Special Agent and Chiang Kai-shek Special Agent Ji Shaohan and Mu Shuqin. Ji was captured twice and released twice by our democratic government during the early stage of the War of Resistance against Japan until Yan's puppet regime occupied Changzhi. This criminal did not repent and secretly organized a "Revenge Team" during the mass movement, sabotaging the mass movement and buying off the masses, killing the activist Han Jingui. These two criminals committed heinous crimes. The government, in response to the people's demands, legally sentenced them to death.

    [Our Newspaper Changzhi News] Since Changzhi City launched a mass anti-traitor and anti-special agent movement on the 23rd of last month in conjunction with war preparations, great achievements have been made. The truth of the Chiang Kai-shek special agent armed "Loyal Righteousness Build the Nation Army" conspiracy to riot has been revealed. After the principal offender Li Runchun was executed by firing squad according to law, the remaining deceived members, under the lenient policy of the democratic government, confessed and repented one after another. Now that the obstacles to the mass emancipation movement have been removed, after summing up this anti-traitor movement on the 24th, the city's cadres are now entering the winter mass movement under the slogan of thoroughly eliminating feudalism and completing the liquidation and emancipation task this winter.

　　长治市组织人民法庭
    处决蒋特李连泉
    【本报长治讯】长治市于十三日组织人民法庭，公审蒋特“忠义健国军”阴谋暴动案。会上李海泉、张炎行痛述误入歧途、参加“忠义建国军”及危害解放区经过，群众念其能彻底坦白认错，准其取保释放。马贵岁因不够坦白，继续扣押教育。当李润春被提审问时，许多群众指着质问他的滔天罪恶，连李的兄弟李连泉也指着他恨恨地说：“我就是上他的当，参加了特务组织。到长子屯留送信联络，造谣劝走斗争对象的。”特务李润春因事实俱在，有口难辩，一一承认，全场群众愤激异常，高呼：“坚决肃清特务，保卫翻身果实”，要求政府镇压罪大恶极的特务李润春，民主政府接受民意，霍副市长当场宣布特务李润春处死刑，执行枪决。

    【又讯】公审特务李润春之前一天，东街及西街群众分别开会公审阎特兼蒋特季少韩、穆书琴。季在抗战初至阎伪进占长治期间，曾被我民主政府两次捕获，两次释放。该犯不知回头，群运中又秘密组织“复仇队”，破坏群运，收买群众，将积极分子韩金桂打死。该两犯罪大恶极，政府特接收群众要求，依法将其判处死刊。

    【本报长治讯】长治市自上月二十三日结合备战展开群众性除奸反特运动，至今已取得很大成绩。蒋特武装“忠义建国军”阴谋暴动案，真象大白，主犯李润春依法枪决后，其余被骗上当分子在民主政府宽大政策下，纷纷坦白悔过。现群众翻身运动障碍已除，全市干部于二十四日总结这段反奸运动后，在今冬彻底消灭封建，完成清算翻身任务的口号下，正转入冬季群运。
