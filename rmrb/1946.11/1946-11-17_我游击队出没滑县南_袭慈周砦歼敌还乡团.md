    [Benbao Jiluyu Battlefield West Line 15th Electric] The Jiang and puppet troops occupying the Huaxian area of northern Henan attempted to thoroughly eliminate the activities of the local Eighth Route Army. However, due to the local guerrillas' familiarity with the terrain, they were still able to persist in guerrilla warfare in the heart of the area controlled by the Jiang and puppet forces. On the 11th, a unit of guerrillas suddenly attacked Cizhouzhai, a nest of Jiang's troops northwest of Changyuan, in broad daylight, annihilating all the Home Return Corps and the Jiang Family Township Office entrenched in the village, killing more than ten enemies, capturing seven, and seizing more than ten rifles. After the battle, they safely left from near Shangguan, where the invading army brigade headquarters was stationed. The enemies in Shangguan and Zhangsanzhai scrambled to come to the rescue, and the two sides fought each other. Guerrillas appearing so suddenly also constantly appeared on the highway from Huaxian and Daokou to Changyuan and Dongming. The Jiang and puppet "Home Return Corps" in the area are extremely panicked.

    我游击队出没滑县南
    袭慈周砦歼敌还乡团
    【本报冀鲁豫战场西线十五日电】侵占豫北滑县地区之蒋伪军，企图彻底肃清当地八路军之活动，但由于地方游击队人熟地熟，仍能坚持在蒋伪所控制的腹心地区游击运动。十一日，游击队一部在白天突然袭入长垣西北蒋军巢穴附近的慈周砦，将盘据该村还乡团及蒋家镇公所全部歼灭，计毙敌十余名，俘敌七名，缴获步枪十余支，战斗结束后，旋从进犯军旅部所驻地之上官附近安然他去，上官与张三砦之敌仓慌出援，双方互相打起来。似此突然出现之游击队，在滑县与道口以南长垣至东明的公路上亦不断出现。该地区之蒋伪“还乡团”均极恐慌。
