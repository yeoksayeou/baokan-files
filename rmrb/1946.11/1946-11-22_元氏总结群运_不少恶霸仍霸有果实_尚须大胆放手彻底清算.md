　　Yuanshi Sums Up Mass Movement
    Many Local Tyrants Still Occupy Fruits of Labor
    Thorough Liquidation Still Requires Bold Action
    [This Newspaper Despatch] Yuanshi convened a meeting of county and district cadres and activists at the beginning of the month to summarize the land reform movement in the previous stage. Although the county is located in a border area, with the efforts of all the cadres, eight of the thirty-four administrative villages have realized "land to the tiller," which is no small achievement. When reviewing why feudalism was not completely eliminated in the previous stage of the movement, it was found that some cadres still had serious ideological concerns. The main reason was that the guiding ideology for completely eliminating feudalism was not clear enough. Some comrades even only considered the big local tyrant landlords as feudal forces. When the masses demanded that the wealthy peasants with feudal vestiges return the accounts of blood and sweat, the cadres explained in various ways: "This is a rich peasant, that is a middle peasant, neither can be struggled against," making the masses confused, bearing many "concerns," not knowing what is appropriate, restricting vigorous action. In the movement, some comrades did not think about how to make the masses first act vigorously and then take care of things, but were afraid of violating policies and laws, afraid that the landlords would be completely liquidated and unable to live, and afraid that if the struggle was too fierce, the landlords would escape and retaliate. Therefore, after leaving the landlords with a living, the masses had nothing to liquidate. The masses said: "The struggle is as big as the sky, but the fruits are as small as bricks." When the masses demanded the execution of some of the most hated special agents and local tyrants, the cadres were also hesitant to answer, making the masses feel deeply that they could not get rid of their grievances. Under this ideological concern and unyielding style, many local tyrant landlords still occupy the fruits of labor without withdrawing, and illegally hide guns, not bowing their heads to the masses, and using various methods to counterattack the masses. After review, the thinking of all the cadres suddenly became enlightened, the ideological concerns were removed, and the determination to completely eliminate feudalism and implement the "fill the gaps and make up the deficiencies" policy was further strengthened. Finally, County Chief Zhao called out: "Don't be afraid of legal restrictions, the law is to completely eliminate feudalism; don't be afraid of criticism from superiors, don't be afraid of landlords running away for revenge. Only fear that feudalism is not completely eliminated, unite all the peasants, and boldly advance towards the feudal forces." (Su Zhifang)

　　元氏总结群运
    不少恶霸仍霸有果实
    尚须大胆放手彻底清算
    【本报讯】元氏于月初召开县区干部及积极分子会议，总结前段翻身运动。该县虽处边地，但在全体干部努力下，三十四个行政村中，已有八个村实现耕者有其田，这是不小的成绩。当检讨前段运动中为啥没彻底消灭了封建时，发现有一些干部还存在着严重的思想顾虑，主要是彻底消灭封建的指导思想不够明确，甚至有的同志只认为大恶霸地主是封建势力，群众要求向带封建尾巴的富农收回血汗帐时，干部则多方解释：“这是富农，那是中农，都不能斗”，把群众闹的糊糊涂涂，背上了许多“顾虑”，不知如何才合适，限制了猛烈的行动。在运动中，有些同志不是如何使群众首先猛烈的行动起来，然后照顾，而是怕违犯政策法令，怕把地主清算光了没法活，怕斗狠了地主逃跑报复，所以当给地主留下生活后，群众就没啥可清算了。群众说：“斗争大似天，果实小如砖”。群众要求处决一些最痛恨的特务恶霸时，干部也顾前顾后的不敢答复，使群众痛感出不了冤气。在这种思想顾虑的不放手作风下，不少恶霸地主仍霸有果实未退出，且非法私藏枪枝，不向群众低头，用各种办法向群众反攻。经检讨后，全体干部思想豁然开朗，解除了思想顾虑，更加坚定了彻底消灭封建，贯彻填平补齐方针的决心。最后赵县长号召：“不要怕法令限制，法令就是彻底消灭封建；不要怕上级批评，不要怕地主跑了报复。只怕封建消灭不彻底，团结全体农民，大胆向封建势力进军。”（苏指方）
