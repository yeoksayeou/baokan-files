    Company Kiln Coal Mine After Inspection Work
    Waste Reduced, Quality Improved
    [Our Newspaper, Shahe, 9th] In order to actively conserve and increase production and strive for an early transition to strategic counter-offensive in the patriotic self-defense war, all employees of the Company Kiln Coal Mine in this county recently launched a mass-based work inspection movement following the study of current affairs and ideological examination. In addition to collective inspections by staff, each department conducted in-depth and meticulous inspections separately. The inspections revealed that the waste of manpower and financial resources in the past was quite serious. Some workers still wasted materials, did not take care of tools, were lazy, and engaged in stealing and scraping the bottom during coal collection. The manager's office found that the accounting department was somewhat extravagant, sometimes making arbitrary expenditures without the approval of higher authorities, wasting resources, and failing to make detailed plans and budgets when purchasing materials. The secretary's office systematically inspected and found that the management of office assets was improper, resulting in considerable damage. The general affairs section purchased too much equipment at one time, hindering the turnover of funds. Staff also identified waste in their personal lives and lax and undisciplined work habits that urgently needed to be overcome. After the inspections, the leadership immediately engaged in self-criticism, pointing out shortcomings in past leadership, such as not being thorough enough, focusing more on assigning tasks than on inspection, and failing to fully unleash the enthusiasm of workers in all aspects. Workers also engaged in deep reflection. Many workers said, "In the past, we were slaves and beasts of burden, beaten, suffered, and starved. Now that the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army have come, wages have increased, and working hours have been reduced. The coal kiln is our own. It's a shame that these shortcomings still exist. We are letting down the public and ourselves." Employees immediately formulated specific plans to improve work efficiency and conserve materials. The leadership changed the previous daily wage system to a piece-rate system and established reward and punishment systems to increase production and improve workers' lives. Regarding office life, the small kitchen of the manager's section chief was automatically abolished, and the meals in the large kitchen were improved to reduce daily waste by staff. Specific conservation plans were also formulated for kerosene and coal burning.
    It is reported that since the major inspection improved workers' awareness and the implementation of the piece-rate system, both output and quality have greatly improved. On the basis of a 50% increase in production since March, production has increased by another 20% to 25%. For example, on October 26, 119 "da qu" (large areas) of coal were produced (each "da qu" being 555 "jin" - approximately 277.5 kg), exceeding the original production by 27 large baskets (each basket weighing 80 "jin" - approximately 40 kg). The coal no longer contains the rocks that were frequently present in the past. As production increased, workers' wages also increased accordingly. Large workers now earn more than 20 "jin" of millet per day, and small workers earn at least 15 "jin," an average increase of four to seven "jin" compared to the past.

    公司窑煤矿检查工作后
    浪费减少质量提高
    【本报沙河九日讯】本县公司窑煤矿全体职工为积极节约增产争取爱国自卫战争早日转入战略反攻，最近继时事学习思想检查后又掀起群众性的工作检查运动，除职员集体检查外，各部门均分别作了深入细致的检查。检查中发现过去人力财力浪费现象相当严重，有的工人还存在浪费材料，不爱护工具，怠工及接煤中的偷绑擦底现象；经理科检查出会计部门有些铺张，有时不经上级批准即随意出帐浪费资财，买材料时没有详细计划与预算等。秘书科系统检查出机关资财保管不妥有不少损坏；总务科购置设备时，一次买得太多妨碍了资金之周转。职员们并检查出生活浪费及工作松懈、散漫等现象急需克服。检查后，领导上当即进行自我批评，提出过去领导不深入，检查少布置多，未能以各方面充分发扬工人积极性等缺点。工友们亦进行了深刻反省，许多工人说：“过去咱是奴隶牛马，挨打受罪还挨饿，如今共产党八路军来了，增加了工资，又减少了工作时间，煤窑就是咱们自己的，还发生这些缺点真对不起公家又对不起自己。”职工当即分别订出提高工作效率及节约物资的具体计划，领导上则改过去的工资日工制为按件计工制，并订出奖惩制度，以提高产量及改善工人生活；机关生活方面，经理科长的小伙房已自动取消，改善大伙房伙食以减少职员日常浪费，其他灯油烧煤等亦订出了具体节约计划。
    据悉，该窑自大检查提高了工人觉悟及实行按件计工制后，产量与质量均大为提高，在三月份以来增产百分之五十的基础上又增产百分之二十至二十五，如十月二十六日产煤一百一十九大区（每区五五五斤），即超过原产煤二十七大筐，每筐为八○斤），过去煤里经常有的石头也没有了。增产后工人工资亦随之提高，大工每日小米二十斤以上，小工最少也有十五斤，比过去平均增加四斤到七斤。
