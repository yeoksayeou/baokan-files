　　Taihang Third Administrative Office Supports Women's Textile Production
    Cooperative Enterprises Develop Rapidly
    Textile Industry in Hebei-Shanxi Exceeds Pre-War Levels
    [Our Newspaper, Changzhi News] The rural cooperative enterprises in the Taihang Third Administrative District have seen rapid development in the past year. According to statistics from Wu'an, Shexian, Linxian, Cixian, Anyang, and Huixian counties, 809 villages have established cooperatives, with over 185,100 members, and share capital has reached 13,756,000,000 yuan, an increase of 4.7 times compared to before March of this year. Among them, Shexian, an old revolutionary base area, has seen the most widespread development, with 202 cooperatives established in 213 administrative villages throughout the county. In Wu'an, 90% of the villages have established cooperatives. Even in the new district of Cixian, the rate has reached 13%. The main business of the cooperatives is to support the masses in developing agricultural and sideline production, with the greatest success in supporting women's textile production. In Shexian, where there was previously no tradition of textile production, over 26,000 women are now regularly engaged in textile work. According to statistics from Wu, She, Lin, and Hui counties, there are over 174,000 women engaged in textile production. Assuming each person weaves 25 jin of cloth per year, the total output would be over 7 million jin of cloth, which is more than enough to clothe themselves. This year, the Taihang Third Administrative District estimates that the minimum cotton production in the eight counties of Lin, Wu, Hui, An, Ci, Ji, Qi, and Tang will be 20 million jin. The bumper cotton harvest indicates that the textile industry in the region will see even greater development this winter. (You Ren)
    [Xinhua News Agency, Fuping Dispatch] On both sides of the Pinghan Railway, the textile industry in the six counties of Xingtang, Jianping, Pingshan, Lingshou, Quyang, and Dingbei in the Third District of Hebei-Shanxi has exceeded pre-war levels. The number of folk spinning wheels has increased to over 228,800, and the number of looms has reached over 11,100. In some counties and districts, textile production has become an important factor in the economic life of the masses. For example, in Xingtang Chengxiang, out of 1,240 women, 1,076 are engaged in textile production, accounting for 87% of the total. "To get rich, spin and weave" has become a well-known household proverb. Dingbei County, with a population of over 100,000, has a total of 39,500 spinning wheels. In the past three years, it has spun over 8.39 million jin of yarn. In addition to supplying the county with over 550,000 bolts of cloth for weaving, a large amount is also exported. This spring and summer, poor and disaster-stricken people in the county have relied on textile income to restore over 1,000 houses destroyed by the war, build 226 wells, add over 100 waterwheels, 209 head of draught animals, and over 1,000 pieces of agricultural implements. 837 families have escaped poverty and risen to become middle peasants.
