Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 14th: On the night of October 30th, during the New Fourth Army's counterattack to recover Jiaoling Town southeast of Lianshui, Huang Zuoqing, the squad leader of the 8th Squad, 8th Company, 7th Battalion, 574th Regiment, 192nd Brigade, 28th Division of the Chiang Kai-shek army, led his entire squad in an uprising at the front line, bringing one submachine gun and several rifles to join the New Fourth Army. When the reporter visited him, Squad Leader Huang was wearing a black cotton overcoat. Speaking of the uprising, he said very excitedly: "At that time, my squad was assigned to the front line. When the moon was about to set at night, I couldn't bear it any longer. I raised my submachine gun and said to my brothers, 'Everyone, follow me! If anyone asks, tell them we are looking at the terrain!' And that's how we joined your army and received a welcome and hospitality we had never experienced before." Huang is from Leping, Jiangxi. At the beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he joined the army out of patriotism. He was once wounded in 1930 and took leave to return to his hometown. Soon after, he enlisted in the army on behalf of his younger brother, but his younger brother was still conscripted. His family is left with an elderly mother and a weak younger sister, living in poverty. He deeply resented the civil war and had long wanted to leave. Now he has finally achieved his wish.

    华中蒋嫡系廿八师黄班长
    率领全班火线起义
    携带所有枪械投奔我军
    【新华社华中十四日电】上月三十日夜，新四军反击收复涟水东南茭菱镇战斗中，蒋军二十八师一九二旅五七四团七营八连八班班长黄作清率全班携冲锋枪一挺步枪数支举行火线起义，投奔新四军。记者走访时，黄班长身着黑色棉大衣；谈到起义，他非常兴奋地说：“当时，我这一班被派在最前线，夜间月亮快要落下去的时候，我再也忍耐不住了，提起冲锋枪对弟兄们说：“大家跟我来，如有人问起，回答是看地形的好了！”我们就这样投入了贵军，受到从来未受过的欢迎与招待。”黄系江西乐平人，抗战开始，激于爱国心而自动投军。三十年曾一度负伤，请假回籍。不久又代幼弟补丁入伍，但结果幼弟仍被抓走。家余老母弱妹，生活困难。彼极厌恶内战，久思脱离，至此始克如愿。
