General Liu Bocheng used the "tiger digs out the heart" tactic to strike at Chiang Kai-shek's thieving behavior after the ceasefire order, annihilating more than 11,000 of his troops in four days. On the third day of the battle (November 21), he allowed us to visit his front-line command post. He was wearing a brand-new blue cotton military uniform, his movements were agile, he was a bit fatter than in the photos I had seen of him, and to my surprise, he was much younger than I had expected. He first told us about the course of this battle: Chiang Kai-shek, while ordering a ceasefire from noon on November 11, secretly ordered his troops occupying the Huaxian area to continue advancing and seize Puyang if the opportunity arose. "This is a thieving tactic," he said. "He wants to paralyze us with his ceasefire order, but we won't fall for it. With someone like Chiang Kai-shek, Lu Xun's 'Tui Bei Tu' (a Chinese prophecy book) is good. Whatever he says, you have to think of the opposite." The situation at the time was this: from east to west, there were three major strongholds. He Guan's Hebei Provincial Security 12th General Detachment relied on Zhulou, Jiang Xiefeng's 125th Brigade relied on Shao'erzhai, and Yang Xianming's 104th Brigade relied on Shangguan Village. Everyone reached out to steal towards Puyang, each extending more than twenty miles and establishing many small strongholds. "Our method of fighting is also strange," General Liu said with a smile. "We ignore those outstretched hands, we brushed past their hands, went through their small strongholds, and suddenly grabbed their waists, the 'tiger digs out the heart', attacking their roots, Zhulou, Shao'erzhai, Shangguan Village, and resolved the issue by eliminating their brigade headquarters and general detachment headquarters, capturing Brigade Commander Yang Xianming, Deputy Brigade Commander Li Keyuan, and General Detachment Commander He Guan." He paused and continued, "You cannot use human emotions or common sense to infer Chiang Kai-shek. He just does inhuman things and you must study 'Tui Bei Tu'." He mentioned that in Yang Xianming's brigade headquarters, they obtained a secret order from Chiang Kai-shek that after the ceasefire order, they should continue to attack, but were strictly prohibited from publishing battle reports. At this time, the old revolutionary's expression was very complex, with the indignation of a brave man, the composure of a wise man, and the enthusiasm of a benevolent man, enthusiastically teaching people not to be fooled. He allowed us to go to the battlefield to see Chiang Kai-shek's fortifications. "That is a very solid tortoise shell. This is Chiang Kai-shek's tortoise tactic," he said. "It is indeed not easy for us to break in, but it is also difficult for them, from the brigade commander to the cook, to crawl out. You can imagine how strong it is!" I asked him to talk about Chiang Kai-shek's strategy and tactics in his capacity as an authoritative military strategist. He said, "His tortoise tactic is the so-called 'step-by-step advance', and another set is 'parallel advance and long pursuit'. Since the civil war, he has used these two things to fight us. In the hundred days since August 10 this year, I have fought five battles with him and eliminated eleven of his brigades. In the first battle of Longhai, he advanced step by step, and I wiped out two of his brigades; in the second battle of Dingcao, he changed to parallel advance and long pursuit, and I wiped out four of his brigades; in the third battle of Zhangfengji, it was again parallel advance and long pursuit, losing one and a half brigades; so this time he changed to step-by-step advance, adopting the so-called strategic offensive and tactical defense. In short, he suffers a loss with this set and switches to that set, and suffers a loss with that set and switches back to this set. Sometimes both sets are used a little, which is the so-called 'turning over the cowhide hawthorn, turning over the fish-maw cowhide'!" This was a Sichuan dialect saying, and the amiable old man laughed heartily with us. "His fatal weakness lies in the fact that this is a war of betraying the motherland and oppressing the people, and now is the era of the people." He said, "No matter what country's military theory, the defensive force must be much smaller than the mobile force. For example, a ratio of one to nine is already too much. If you want to sell the country, be a dictator, and exploit, you must oppress the people. The people already know how to resist, so you must strengthen the defensive force to control them; otherwise, the people will not listen to you. He is now using too much force for defense. The 5th Army and 11th Division, such fully American-equipped troops, are being used for defense, which is too uneconomical. At the same time, they are not as strong as the Japanese. The Japanese could defend a place with a squad or platoon, but now he stipulates that an entire battalion of people will not fight. They have three fears of us: first, fear of night battles; second, fear of field battles; and third, fear of bayonet battles. The bayonet battles are because the soldiers are afraid, and the night battles and field battles are because they are afraid that the soldiers will run away. The soldiers are all conscripted; no matter how good the planes and artillery are, they need people to use them! Who will be your soldiers? He concentrates the troops on the front line. What about the emptiness in the rear? What if the people revolt?" He repeatedly said, "This is an unsolvable contradiction. Our proposition of independence, democracy, and peace, implementing 'land to the tiller', the peasants have all risen up, and soldiers are conducting a patriotic self-defense war. This is the basis for victory." Finally, regarding the issue of the gains and losses of cities, he said, "This is a very simple calculation. For example, he takes 150 brigades, and I take 150 cities, one for one. When I have wiped out these 150 brigades, aren't these 150 cities still mine!" He told me another story. He said, "The people easily understand this principle. During the battle of Juancheng three weeks ago, an old man in Juancheng asked his son: Has it been eliminated? How was it eliminated? The son said: It was really eliminated, and the brigade commander was captured alive. He saw it with his own eyes. Another old man interjected and said: This method is the best. Eliminate one part of him in the east and another part of him in the west. When he has no one to defend the city, it will be right."

　　刘伯承将军谈蒋介石
    李普
    刘伯承将军以猛虎掏心战术打击蒋介石停战令以后的偷儿行为，四天之内歼灭了他一万一千多人。战役开始的第三天（十一月二十一日），他允许我们到他的前线指挥所去看他，他穿着一套崭新的蓝色棉军服，动作矫捷，比我所见的他的照片胖一些，而且大出我的意外，比我预想中的他要年青得多。他首先告诉我们这次战役的经过：蒋介石一面下令于十一月十一日中午起停战，一面密令他侵占滑县一带的部队继续前进，相机侵占濮阳。“这是偷儿形式”，他说：“他想以他的停战令麻痹我们，可是我们不上当，他越下令停战，我越当心他吃我，对蒋介石这种人，鲁迅的‘推背图’说得好，他说什么话，你要从反面想”。当时的形势是这样，这一线从东到西是三个大据点，何冠三的河北保安第十二总队以朱楼为依托，江匣锋的一二五旅以邵儿砦为依托，杨显明的一○四旅以上官村为依托，大家伸出手来向濮阳方面偷摸，各各伸展出来二十多里，建立了许多小据点。“我们打法也怪”，刘将军微笑着说：“我们不理会那些伸出来的手，我们从他们的手边擦过，穿过他们的小据点，一下子抱住他的腰，猛虎掏心打他的根根朱楼、邵儿砦、上官村，一下子解决消灭了他们的旅部和总队部，俘虏了旅长杨显明、副旅长李克源和总队长何冠三”。他顿了顿接着说：“蒋介石你不能以人情常理来推断他，他就是不做人的事要学‘推背图’”。他提到这次在杨显明的旅部，得到蒋介石一个密令，停战令以后仍旧继续进攻，但是严禁发表战报。这时候，这位老革命家的表情是很复杂的，有勇者的愤慨，智者的镇静和仁者的热忱，热忱地教人不要上当。他允许我们到战地去看看蒋介石的工事。“那是很坚固的乌龟壳，这就是蒋介石的乌龟战术”。他说：“我们固属不容易打进去，但是他们从旅长到伙夫要爬出来也很困难，你可以想到那是多么结实”！我请他以权威军事家的资格谈谈蒋介石的战略战术，他说：“他这乌龟战术即所谓步步为营，另外还有一套是并进长追。从内战以来，他打我们就是这两套东西。从今年八月十号以来一百天内，我跟他打了五仗，消灭了他十一个旅，第一次陇海之战，他是步步为营，我干掉他两个旅；第二次定曹之战，他改成并进长追，我干掉他四个旅；第三次张凤集之战，又是并进长追，送掉一个半旅；所以这次又换成步步为营，采取所谓战略的进攻，战术的防御了。总而言之，这一套吃了亏换那一套，那一套吃亏又换这一套，有时候两套都带一点，这就是所谓翻过来牛皮楂，翻过去鳔牛皮”！这是一句四川土话，和蔼的老人和我们一起大笑了。“他的至命弱点在于这是出卖祖国、压迫人民的战争，而现在已是人民的时代”。他说：“无论那一国的军事学说，守备兵力必须大大的小于机动兵力，比如说吧，一比九已经太多太多了。你要卖国独裁剥削，非压迫人民不可，人民已经晓得反抗，你就一定得加强守备兵力才能控制，否则人民就不听招呼了。他现在用于守备的兵力太大，第五军、十一师这样的完全美械部队都拿来守备，太不合算。同时，他们没有日本人强，日本人一排一班可以守个地方，而他现在规定一营人都不打仗。他们对我们有三怕：一怕夜战，二怕野战，三怕白刃战。白刃战是士兵们不敢，夜战、野战呢，怕士兵们跑，士兵都是抓丁来的；再好的飞机大炮也要人拿呀！谁来给你当兵。他把军队集中到前线来，后方空虚怎么办？老百姓发生民变怎么办”？他一再的说：“这是无法解决的矛盾；我们独立民主和平的主张，实行耕者有其田，农民都起来了，当兵进行爱国自卫战争，这就是制胜的根据”。最后，关于城市得失问题，他说：“这是很简单的算盘，比如他拿一百五十个旅，我拿一百五十个城，一个换一个，等到我把这一百五十个旅消灭完了，这一百五十个城不还是我的”！他又为我说了一个故事，他说：“老百姓很容易懂得这个道理，三个星期之前的鄄城之役时，鄄城有一个老头子问他的儿子：到底消灭了没有，怎么消灭了？儿子说：消是真的消灭了，旅长活捉了起来，他亲眼看见的。另一个老头子插嘴说：这办法最好，东消灭他一股，西消灭他一股，等到他没有人守城就对了”。
