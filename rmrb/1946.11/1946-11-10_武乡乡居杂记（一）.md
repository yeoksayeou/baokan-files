　　Every Village Has Down-to-the-Countryside Cadres

　　After coming to Wuxiang, the first new term I heard was "down-to-the-countryside cadres." To see how many down-to-the-countryside cadres there actually were in Wuxiang, I asked about it in the more than ten villages I visited—Hanjiapu, Guojiapu, Baijiazhuang, Miaodu, Moyu, Huling, Xiabeizhang, Yaoshanggou, etc. Surprisingly, even the smallest villages had down-to-the-countryside cadres.

　　On the way to Moyu, I met a cadre-like person, carrying a leather satchel and holding a small stick. I asked him where he was going, and he proudly told me, "Down to the countryside!" Upon further inquiry, I learned that he was going down from Changzhi city to work. It is worthy of pride and boasting to go down to the plains away from home to fight for the revolution. In a small village called Baijiazhuang, two or three miles away from Panlong, I once talked with several villagers about the labor force in their village. They immediately told me, "Our village has more than a dozen dependents of soldiers and three down-to-the-countryside cadres." In their tone, they considered it not only the glory of the down-to-the-countryside people themselves but also the glory of the whole village.

　　In the past, people in Wuxiang were reluctant to leave home. People used to ridicule them like this: "Wuxiang children can't leave their mothers." They themselves did not deny this. But now it is completely different.

　　New Society Celebrates New Seasonal Festivals

　　Several days before the Mid-Autumn Festival, the village cadres suddenly became busy. After a meeting, each household actively donated white flour and vegetables. The village office sent people to the market to buy wine and various seasonings, as if they were preparing for a big happy event.

　　I knew that people were preparing to invite military dependents and retired soldiers during the Mid-Autumn Festival. Inviting military dependents and retired soldiers during the Mid-Autumn Festival has become a fixed holiday in rural areas since the War of Resistance. But I didn't know what other festivals people celebrated.

　　After the Mid-Autumn Festival, I ran to Yaoshanggou. At the village head's house, I saw a reading and writing textbook. Upon flipping through it, I saw a lesson on "New Seasonal Festivals," which immediately attracted me.

　　Ah! It turns out that the people of Wuxiang had completely abolished the old seasonal festivals long ago. Now, they celebrate a total of twelve new seasonal festivals each year, including:

　　1. The first day of the first lunar month (Chinese New Year) is Respect for the Elderly Day. On this day, people visit the elders in the village to wish them a happy new year and longevity. Each village has a festive atmosphere with drums and music, and also sets up a Longevity Pavilion to feast the elders.

　　2. The fifteenth day of the first lunar month is Support-the-Army and Give-Preferential-Treatment-to-Military-Dependents Day.

　　3. Qingming Festival is the Day of Remembrance for Fallen Martyrs. Now, each village has built martyrs' pavilions or monuments for the militiamen and soldiers who sacrificed themselves in the War of Resistance, erected at the entrance of the village or in the middle of the village.

　　4. March 8th is International Women's Day.

　　5. April 4th is Children's Day.

　　6. May 1st is International Labor Day.

　　7. May 4th is Youth Day.

　　8. June 6th is Teachers' Day.

　　9. July 7th is the National Anti-Japanese War Unity Day.

　　10. The fifteenth day of the eighth lunar month is the Heroic Enemy-Killing Day (the day for feasting military dependents and retired soldiers).

　　11. October 10th is Heroes' Day. Because by this time, the autumn harvest is mostly completed, people are summing up production and selecting various heroes. The county also holds a heroes' meeting around this time each year.

　　12. New Year's Day is the Support-Cadres-and-Love-the-People Day. At this time, mass cadres gather together to conduct self-criticism and provide opinions to each other in order to improve their work in the coming year.

　　The above are considered general festivals from top to bottom throughout the county.

　　In addition to this, during the slack seasons of farming, the village theater troupes are very active, regardless of whether it is a seasonal festival or not. Indeed, new festivals and mass cultural and recreational activities have become a common occurrence in Wuxiang.

　　"In the first lunar month, the old society was filled with hooligans and corruption, without organization or labor, and even gambling. In the first lunar month, the new society has undergone great changes, with organization and planning, production and entertainment."

　　"In the second lunar month, the old society held disaster sacrifices in every village, preaching superstition and praying to gods for peace. In the second lunar month, the new society officially began spring plowing, making manure and building embankments, officially starting spring plowing."

　　This is a song that was popular throughout Wuxiang several years ago. Now Wuxiang is really like the new society in the song. If you live in the countryside for a few days, you can personally experience this fresh rural atmosphere.

### 武乡乡居杂记（一）

　　武乡乡居杂记（一）
    郑笃
    村村有下山干部
    来武乡后，我初次听到一个新名词，即：“下山干部”。为了看看武乡究竟有多少下山干部，我在我所到过的十多个村——韩家＠、郭家＠、白家庄、苗度、陌峪、胡蛮岭、下北漳、窑上沟等村，都顺便问了问，令人惊异的是任何小的村庄也都有下山干部。
    去陌峪的路上，我曾碰到一个干部模样的人，挎着皮挎包，手里拿着一根小棍。我问他去那里，他气壮的告我说：“下山呀！”探询之下，原来他是下长治市去工作。为革命打江山，下平川远离家乡，这是值得气壮而骄傲的。离蟠龙二三里地远的地方，有个叫白家庄的小村，有次，我和村上几个老乡谈到他村劳力问题，他们一开口就告我说：“俺村有十多个抗属，还有三个下山干部。”语气之间，他们不但认为是下山人们本人的光荣，也认为是全村的光荣。
    过去武乡人是不愿离开家的，人们曾这样嘲笑过他们：“武乡娃娃，离不开妈妈。”他们自己也不否认这一点。但现在却完全不同了。
    新社会过新节气
    中秋节前数天，各村干部突然忙碌起来，开过一次会议后，各家即纷纷募捐白面蔬菜，村公所即派人赶集打酒买各种调料，像要赶办什么大喜事一样。
    我知道，这是人们准备要在中秋节时请军属和荣退军人。中秋节请军属荣退军人，这在抗战以来已成了农村中的一个固定节日。但另外人们还过些什么节，我却不知道。
    中秋节过后，我跑到了窑上沟，在村长家里，我看到一本读写课本，翻阅之下，看到有“新节气”一课，立即吸引住了我。
    啊！原来武乡人民早已彻头彻尾废止了旧日的旧节气。现在每年中他们过的新节气共有十二个，计：
    一、正月初一（阴历）是敬老节。每逢这天，即给村上老人们拜年祝寿。各村都是鼓乐喧天，细吹细打，还搭有万寿亭，在亭上宴请老人们。
    二、正月十五（阴历）拥军优抗节。
    三、清明为追悼死难烈士节。现各村对于抗战中牺牲了的民兵和战士，都建有烈士亭或纪念碑，树立在村口或村中间。
    四、三八妇女节。
    五、四四儿童节。
    六、五一劳动节。
    七、五四青年节。
    八、六六教师节。
    九、七七全民抗战团结节。
    十、八月十五（阴历）杀敌英雄节。（宴请抗属荣退军人的这天）
    十一、十月十日群英节。因这时大都秋收完毕，人们正总结生产，选拔各种英雄，县上每年也大都在这前后开群英大会。
    十二、新年为拥干爱民节。这时群众干部即一起聚会，进行自我检讨，互相提供意见，，以便改进下年工作。
    以上算是全县自上而下的一般节日。
    除此以外，每当农忙空隙，各村剧团不论节气不节气，也是十分活跃。的确，新的节日和群众性的文娱工作，在武乡已经成了一种习以为常的事情了。
    “正月里，旧社会流氓腐化，无组织不劳动，还要赌博。正月里，新社会大有变化，有组织有计划，生产娱乐。”
    “二月里，旧社会村村祭灾，讲迷信求神灵，瞎想平安。二月里，新社会正式春耕，又造粪又垒堰，正式春耕。”
    这是数年前流行在全武乡的歌曲，现在武乡已真如歌曲中的新社会一样了。倘你乡居数日，便能够亲身领略到这种新鲜的农村气象。
