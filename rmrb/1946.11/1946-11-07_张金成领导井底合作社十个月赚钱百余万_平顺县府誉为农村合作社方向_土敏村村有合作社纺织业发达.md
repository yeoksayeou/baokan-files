　　Zhang Jincheng Leads Jingdi Cooperative to Earn Over One Million in Ten Months
　　Ping Shun County Government Praises as Direction for Rural Cooperatives
　　Tumin Village Has Cooperatives in Every Village, Textile Industry Flourishes

[This newspaper Ping Shun news] Jingdi Village Cooperative in the Seventh District of this county, under the leadership of cooperative hero Zhang Jincheng, promoted the village's sideline production and earned a net profit of more than 1.3 million yuan in ten months. When the cooperative was established in January this year, it only had 4,000 yuan in shares, all in mountain goods and grain. Zhang Jincheng personally carried the goods to other places to sell them, and exchanged them for necessary supplies to bring back. By May, it had earned 17,000 yuan. Zhang Jincheng realized that making small money could not lead to prosperity, so he mobilized women to organize. Initially, only ten women, including Kong Ronghua, participated. The cooperative provided them with twenty catties of cotton, and they wove sixteen zhang of cloth in twelve days, earning a net profit of 3,200 yuan. When women throughout the village saw the benefits, 155 women immediately joined and established a textile factory. Seeing that carrying goods could earn money, active members Cheng Jinghuai and Sang Yangbao organized seven porter teams with 61 people. The cooperative helped them find business, and they earned 327,000 yuan in two months. The cooperative used the money to buy willow branches and organized a basket-weaving group of 21 people, weaving 1,200 baskets and earning 40,000 yuan. The cooperative used the money to establish a woodworking factory, specializing in manufacturing spinning wheels, hand-pulled shuttles, and agricultural tools. It also organized tea-picking and black leaf (indigo raw material) gathering groups. When the cooperative summarized its work in October, it had earned a net profit of more than 1.31 million yuan, equivalent to 220 shi of rice at market prices. This has been of great help to the people of Jingdi, who only have 1.8 mu of land per person. The county government has awarded Zhang Jincheng the title of first-class cooperative hero and praised him as the direction for rural cooperatives. (Zhao Chunxi, Hengsha)

[Taiyue, October 31st Dispatch] In mid-October, Shimin County convened a meeting of cooperative cadres from across the county to summarize the work of the cooperatives in the first half of the year and determine the business policy for this winter. In the past six months, 80 cooperatives have been organized in 77 administrative villages across the county, ensuring that every village has a cooperative, and some even have more than two. These cooperatives all have a large amount of shares and members. According to a survey of 53 cooperatives, they have a total of 10 million yuan in shares and 9,600 members. Their businesses are closely integrated with the needs of farmers, with 31 dyeing workshops, 15 oil mills, 21 textile factories, 26 flour mills, 6 pharmacies, 4 blacksmith shops, 5 wool weaving factories, 3 paper mills, and 2 tobacco workshops. The textile industry is the most developed, with 6,466 spinners, 5,906 spinning wheels, 1,216 small looms, 161 flat looms, 28 pull looms, 469 cotton gins, and 206 cotton bows. In the past six months, the dividends from spinning and transportation were 407 shi of millet, and the cooperatives have become a powerful leading organization in the rural economy. The meeting also determined that the main business for this winter and next spring is to organize a large amount of textile production, weaving all of the 278,000 jin of clean cotton produced this autumn into cloth, so that the 70,000 people in the county can be self-sufficient in clothing. In the old textile areas, 100% of women should be organized to participate, while in newly developed areas, 70% should be organized. The textile movement is now rapidly developing.
