How Xiaogudun in Wenshang Solved Internal Conflicts Among Peasants in Land Distribution
Zhang Wen, Liu Zheng

In the large-scale land reform movement, there were many internal conflicts among peasants regarding the distribution of land, often leading to disputes. If the leadership cannot promptly and thoroughly understand the situation, enlighten the masses ideologically, and maximize democracy as much as possible, adopting fair and reasonable methods for land distribution under the conditions of the masses' willingness and awareness, then it is completely impossible to thoroughly realize "land to the tiller."

In this land reform in Xiaogudun, Wenshang, the peasants completely abandoned the idea of "changing the heavens," and recognized from personal experience that the Communist Party was their support and their savior. Thus, one person said the Communist Party should liberate me, while another thought I had suffered more in the past and should be liberated. Everyone wanted to get more land and live better than others. This created many complex problems.

When dividing the land, the tenant farmers wanted more, and wanted good land, at least one "da mu" (three "xiao mu") per person. Poor peasants felt that it was inappropriate for tenant farmers to want so much and want good land. Local farmers also wanted more land, planning not to include the local people in the distribution, although they knew that the landlords would not get their land back. Newly promoted middle peasants also felt that they had rushed to the front in the struggle, and it was a loss if they did not get any land as a result. At the same time, they felt they had contributed and wanted more, more than others. Ordinary middle peasants also wanted to get a little more. In addition, the masses who participated in the meetings felt that it was a loss to give the land they had fought for to others. Therefore, they felt that those who participated in the meetings should not be distributed the same as those who did not, and those who participated should get more. They could not "treat dry goods and wet goods the same." ... Because there were these conflicts among the peasants, many difficulties arose in the distribution of land.

After the leadership clearly understood these conflicts, it convened a general meeting to carry out ideological enlightenment. It explained that everyone had been oppressed by the landlords in the past, with only slight differences in the degree of oppression. Therefore, everyone should turn over together now, turning against the landlords, not fighting each other. At the same time, it was further explained that only when everyone turned over, everyone had land to cultivate, and everyone had food to eat, could everyone live a good life. The masses who participated in the meetings were educated to understand that their participation in the meetings was progress, but the work would not be done well if they only progressed themselves. They should absorb those who had not yet participated in the meetings to do a good job of the village's affairs. If they took more for themselves and others were not satisfied, causing everyone to disagree, it would be difficult to do anything in the future. The tenant farmers were sympathized with for their suffering, and efforts were made to give them a little more good land, while making them realize that others had also suffered a lot, and they should not be special. The newly promoted middle peasants were criticized for their backward thinking, and it was explained that everyone knew their contributions, and they should want to be good to the end, not greedy for petty advantages, and not emulate the backward. ... In this way, everyone became enlightened. They all deeply realized that "the poor of the world are one family," and explained their own wrong ideas. Everyone laughed. As a result, all the contradictions were readily resolved.

In this way, the land distribution method was quickly decided under the circumstances that everyone considered reasonable. 1. The 190 mu of land that landlords had falsely pawned or evaded burdens and pawned at low prices were all turned into basic farmland for the masses. Those who had pawned land as rich peasants were subject to arbitration and given appropriate compensation. If it was middle or poor peasants who had pawned land, all of it would be returned to the original owners. 2. Temple land was confiscated and distributed, and monks were allocated land based on one household. 3. Land mortgaged in this village by outsiders would belong to the village if it belonged to landlords. If it belonged to middle peasants or below, it would still belong to the original owners. 4. Sixteen tenant farmers had no houses and all lived in the houses of fugitive landlords, and it was decided that whoever lived in it would own it. 5. The tenant farmers suffered a lot. In addition to giving them houses if they did not have houses, and threshing grounds if they did not have threshing grounds, each person was given an extra two "fen" of good land.

As for the general distribution method, it was decided that all farmers with less than 2.5 mu of land per person would be brought up to that level, and everyone would be allocated at least 2.5 mu of land. Families of revolutionary martyrs were special, with 3.2 mu of good land allocated to each person. Families of soldiers were allocated 3 mu of good land per person. Local military families were allocated 2.7 or 2.8 mu per person, and other orphans, widows, and disabled people were given appropriate care.

In short, the land distribution in Xiaogudun was successfully resolved because it timely resolved the ideological conflicts among the peasants, and the research was quite detailed. The masses themselves elected councilors and organized a council to discuss and resolve each household's specific situation. Under the conditions of the masses' conscious willingness, the land distribution problem was satisfactorily resolved.

　　汶上小姑墩怎样解决了分配土地中农民内部矛盾
    张文　刘政
    大规模的土地改革运动中，在分配土地上，农民内部有很多的矛盾，往往争执不下。领导上如不能及时深入了解，启发群众思想觉悟，并尽量的发扬民主，在群众自愿自觉的条件下，采用公平合理的办法来分配土地，那么，要想彻底实现耕者有其田，是完全不可能的。
    汶上小姑墩在此次土地改革中，农民们由于完全去掉了变天思想，从亲身体验里，认清了共产党是他们的靠山，是他们的救命恩人；于是，这个说共产党应当解放我，那个则以为我过去受得苦多，应当解放我，大家都想多分点地，比别人过得强些。这样，就产生了不少复杂的问题。
    佃户们在分土地时想多要，要好地，每人至少合一大亩（三小亩）。贫农则觉得：佃户多要又要好地，有些不应该，当地的农民，也想再多要点，分土地时准备不把当地算在内，虽然，他们也明知地主不会回地了。新升的中农也认为在斗争当中，他们跑到顶头里，结果分不着地是吃亏。同时，又觉得自己有功，还想多要点，总该比别人多才对。一般的中农也想多少再分点。另外，在会的群众则认为自己斗来的地给人家有点亏。他们因之觉得在会的跟不在会的不能一样分，在会的应该多分点。不能“干货湿货一样钱”。………因为农民中有了这些矛盾，结果，在分配土地时，就发生了不少困难。
    领导上了解清楚这些矛盾后，就召开大会来进行思想启发。说明大家过去都是受地主压迫的，只是轻重上稍微有点差别罢了，所以，现在翻身应当大家一齐翻，向地主身上翻，不应互相斗。同时更说明只有大家都翻了身，人人有地种，人人有饭吃，大家才能过好日子。对在会的群众，则向他们进行教育，使他们了解自己在会是进步，但光自己进步，工作也搞不好，应该把还没在会的人都吸收进来，才能把村里的事搞好。如果自己多分了，别人都不满意，大家闹意见，以后啥事都难办了。对佃户们除同情他们的痛苦，设法给他们多分一点好地外，并使他们认识别人的痛苦也不少，自己不应特殊。对于新升的中农，则批评了他们这种落后思想，说明他们的功劳大家是知道的，好要好到底，不应该贪这点小便宜，不应向落后的看齐。………这样，大家都想开了。他们都深刻认识到“天下穷人是一家”，都说明白了自己的错误想法，大家都哈哈大笑了。于是，所有的矛盾便迎刃而解。
    这样，土地分配办法就在大家认为合理的情形下，很快的决定了。一、对地主的假当或逃避负担低价出当的地一百九十亩，一律变成群众的基本田，富农出当者实行仲裁，酌量补价。如系中、贫农出当土地，全部回归原主。二、庙地没收分配，和尚以一户计算留地。三、外村在本庄的寄压地，地主的归本村所有，中农以下的仍归原主。四、十六家佃户没有房子，都住的是逃亡地主的，决定谁住就算谁的。五、佃户受苦多，除没宅子给宅子，没场给场外，土地每人多分二分好地。
    至于一般的分配办法，决定一般农民在每人二亩半地以下的取齐，每人至少都得分到二亩半地。烈属是特等，每人分好地三亩二，军属每人分三亩好地，地方军属每人为二亩七、八，其他孤寡残疾者，则适当照应。
    总之，小姑墩的土地分配，由于及时解决了农民中的思想矛盾，并且，研究相当细致，群众自己选举了评议员，组织了评议会，根据每户具体情形，一户一户的讨论解决。在群众自觉自愿的条件下，土地分配问题就圆满解决了。
