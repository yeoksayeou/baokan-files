    Songyao Masses Unanimously Approve
    All Land Voluntarily Offered by Middle Peasants to be Returned

    [Our newspaper, Weixian, 9th dispatch] In the land leveling and replenishment movement in Songyao Village, Yuanchao, some middle peasants were uneasy due to their lack of understanding of our policies and the rumors spread by special agent saboteurs. Recently, at a mass meeting, six puppet personnel (of middle peasant background) confessed their mistakes and offered some land. As a result, other middle peasants became even more fearful and planned to "voluntarily" give up land. Later, in the district briefing, this issue was discussed. Everyone believed that the middle peasants' "voluntary" land offering stemmed from a lack of understanding of the policies and fear of struggle. If it were accepted, it would further arouse the middle peasants' anxiety and affect peasant unity. It was immediately decided to return all the land that had been accepted, and a meeting of agricultural association group leaders was convened to explain that "middle and poor peasants are one family, and only by uniting can we defeat the attacks of big and small Chiang Kai-sheks." The village's thirty group leaders were divided into six groups for discussion. Four groups agreed to return the land completely, and two groups were willing to take a smaller portion. Finally, a centralized discussion was held, and the result was unanimous that taking a smaller portion was also wrong and that it should be returned completely. A mass meeting was held in the evening to explain the middle peasant policy and the handling methods to the masses, who immediately unanimously approved the complete return. The six households who "voluntarily" offered land were all moved and said: "Middle and poor peasants are truly one family, Chairman Mao's methods are truly good, we must correct our mistakes and unite with everyone." Since then, the middle peasants in the village have actively participated in the agricultural association, determined to fight against local tyrants and landlords.

    宋窑群众一致通过
    全部退回中农献田
    【本报威县九日电】元朝宋窑村在填平补齐运动中，一部分中农因对我政策不了解，加以特务破坏分子造谣，便恐慌不安。最近群众大会上，有六个伪人员（中农成分），坦白自己的错误，并献出若干土地。于是一般中农都更加恐惶，打算“自动”土地。后在小区汇报，谈到这一问题，大家认为中农“自动”地系对政策不了解、害怕斗争，如果接受了，更会引起中农不安，影响农民团结。当即决定将已接受的一律退回，并召集农会小组长会议，说明“中贫农是一家，中贫农团结起来才能打退大小老蒋的进攻。”全村三十个组长分六组讨论，四个组同意完全退回，两个组愿意少要一部分。最后集中讨论，结果一致认为少要一部分也不对，应该完全退回。夜间又召开群众会，向群众讲解中农政策及处理办法，群众当即一致通过全部退回。六户“自动”地的都感动的说：“中农贫农真是一家子，毛主席的办法真好，我们一定要纠正错误，和大家团结起来”。至此，该村中农都积极参加农会，决心向恶霸地主斗争。
