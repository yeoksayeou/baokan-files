　　Xinhua News Agency, Tongpu Northern Front, 6th: At 1:30 AM on the 2nd, the Eighth Route Army began its counterattack on Yuanping Town from the east, west, and north. Only ten minutes into the battle, the victorious news of the first enemy position being captured was heard. Soldiers rushed forward, at which point the Yan troops burned down several civilian houses to obstruct the Eighth Route Army. The Eighth Route Army braved the raging fire and charged into the city center. After a brief lull in the artillery fire, the soldiers were heard shouting on the front lines: "Lay down your arms! Don't be cannon fodder for Yan Xishan's civil war!" Soon, weapons were thrown out of doors and windows, and Yan troops were captured in batches and sent to the rear. By dawn, the remnants of the Yan troops were cut into several small pockets, relying on civilian houses and earth forts, holding out for reinforcements. At 11:00 AM on the 2nd, the Eighth Route Army launched a final attack on the headquarters of the 3rd Regiment of the 39th Division, which was holed up in the fortress. The soldiers shouted, "Capture them alive!" Upon hearing this, the Yan troops fled in panic, only to be ambushed by the Eighth Route Army pre-positioned at the Hutuo River, resulting in the complete capture of the Yan troops.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Tongpu Northern Front, 6th: The Jin-North Eighth Route Army supplemented the battle results in the Yuanping recovery campaign: over 600 Yan troops were killed or wounded, and over 800 Yan troops were captured. The captured equipment included two mortars, 19 small cannons, 48 light and heavy machine guns, 23 submachine guns, over 500 rifles, 15 grenade launchers, eight hand grenade launchers, and one vehicle.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 6th: The Central China Democratic Allied Army launched a second victorious self-defense counterattack. A unit of a certain division of the army launched a self-defense counterattack against the strongholds within 20 li around Haizhou, on the eastern section of the Longhai Railway, on the 28th of last month. In just three hours, they captured over ten villages, including Shihou, Xinguang, Ganbu, Beitang, and Zhao Zhuang. Nearly 100 Chiang troops were killed or captured, and a quantity of military supplies was seized.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Ji-Re-Liao, 5th: Local units of the Eighth Route Army operating behind Chiang in central Rehe, ambushed a Chiang military transport team near Ningcheng on the morning of the 4th, seizing five trucks loaded with wheat flour and bedding, one machine gun, two submachine guns, and seven rifles, and capturing over 30 Chiang soldiers, with no losses on our side.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Ji-Re-Liao, 6th: Local corps of the Eighth Route Army operating north of Chifeng have recently continuously suppressed the bandit troops of Zhai Wuhuan and others, who were entrenched between Chifeng and Wudan and colluding with Chiang and the puppet regime. On the 25th of last month, a regiment of the Eighth Route Army attacked over 100 bandits in the Guo Zhangzi area. After several hours of fierce fighting, all the bandits were annihilated, 64 were captured alive, and 55 rifles and 2,500 rounds of ammunition were seized. Over 400 bandits along the Chi (Chifeng)-Wu (Wudan) highway fled southeast upon hearing the news.
