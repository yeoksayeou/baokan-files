Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, November 5th: Reuter's and Associated Press report: The Greek National Liberation Army is very active in northern Greece. The Western Macedonia Headquarters of the Liberation Army has a wide area of jurisdiction, extending south to central Greece. The Liberation Army has distributed pamphlets calling on police and soldiers to defect. Recently, in an attack, the Northern Liberation Army killed a county magistrate and captured six rural military police, while ambushing and seizing two trucks loaded with medicine destined for Salonika. Due to the growing anti-civil war sentiment among lower-ranking officers and soldiers in the Greek reactionary government army, military courts recently sentenced 94 officers and soldiers to death or imprisonment for "aiding guerrillas." Keller, the Chicago Daily News correspondent in Athens, said: "Even if military courts impose the death penalty on soldiers, they cannot eliminate the army's dissatisfaction."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, November 5th: Athens reports: Greece has been pushed to the brink of civil war and destruction by the People's Party (Royalist Party). To confuse the people, the King, hoping to return to the country, planned to "expand" the government and include the opposition parties in the current government as the first thing. After more than a month of negotiations between Tsaldaris (Prime Minister) and opposition leaders Sophoulis, Philon Bondriou, Vannis Selos, and Kanellopoulos, the negotiations have failed. Opposition leaders insisted that a cabinet including representatives of all parties should be formed, and the People's Party should not lead such a government, as the People's Party is not trusted by the people. Opposition leaders announced on October 28th that they would not participate in the government led by Tsaldaris. According to the U.S. News Service, the U.S. and British ambassadors to Greece are trying to win over all parties.

    希王图拉拢反对党未遂
    【新华社延安五日电】综合路透社及合众社讯：希腊民族解放军在希腊北部非常活跃，解放军的西马其顿总指挥部所辖范围很广，一直南下到希腊中部。解放军曾散发小册子，号召警察与军队投诚。最近北部民族解放军在一次袭击中，击毙了县长及俘获六名乡村宪兵，同时伏击与缴获了两辆开往萨罗尼加的满载药品的卡车。为希反动政府军的下级官兵反内战情绪日益增长，最近军事法庭又判处九十四个官兵以死刑或徒刑，罪名是“援助游击队”。芝加哥每日新闻驻雅典记者凯勒说：“即使军事法庭以死刑来处分士兵，也不能消除军队的不满。”
    【新华社延安五日电】综合雅典讯：希腊已为人民党（保皇党）投入内战及毁灭的边沿，为了迷惑人民，希望返国后的第一件事就是计划“扩大”政府，容纳反对党参加现政府。经过月余来曹达利斯（总理）与反对派领袖索福利斯斐邦德里欧凡尼塞罗斯及堪斯罗泊罗斯的谈判已告失败。反对派领袖坚称：应组织包括各党派代表的内阁，而人民党不能领导这样的政府，因人民党不为人民所信任。反对派领袖在上月二十八日宣布，他们不参加曹达利斯所领导的政府。据美新闻处讯：美英驻布大使正力图拉拢各方。
