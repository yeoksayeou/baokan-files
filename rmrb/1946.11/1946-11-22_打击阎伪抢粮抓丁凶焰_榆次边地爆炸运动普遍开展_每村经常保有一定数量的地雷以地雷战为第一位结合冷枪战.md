　　Cracking Down on Yan's Puppet Regime's Atrocities of Seizing Grain and Conscripting Soldiers
    Explosion Campaign Widely Launched in the Border Areas of Yuci
    Each Village Regularly Maintains a Certain Number of Landmines, Prioritizing Landmine Warfare Combined with Sniper Warfare

    [Report from our Changzhi Office] The militia's explosion campaign in the border areas of Yuci has been widely launched. In October alone, 31 landmines were detonated, killing or wounding 69 officers and soldiers of Yan's puppet army below the rank of battalion commander. Two rifles, one pistol, and over 200 rounds of ammunition were seized, and over 17,000 catties of grain and 160 pieces of clothing robbed by Yan's puppet regime were recovered. These victories further stimulated the enthusiasm of the Yuci people in carrying out landmine warfare. They believed that "landmines are truly effective." Every family laid landmines, and every village launched explosions, turning the villages and roads of the Yuci plains into a large minefield. This struck a blow to the Yan puppet army's atrocities of invading to seize grain and conscript soldiers, making them afraid to operate at night and reluctant to venture out casually during the day, or to enter villages and courtyards to plunder at will, because they would have to pay a bloody price if they tried to rob.

    Before September, these battles did not inflict significant casualties on the enemy. For example, in over 70 battles in the first, third, and fourth districts, 270 to 280 rounds of ammunition were expended, only killing or wounding 11 enemies, an average of 25 rounds of ammunition per enemy casualty. The militia faced difficulties in obtaining ammunition. Although the leadership repeatedly advocated landmines, the militia believed that "it is not easy to bury landmines on the plains, and even if they are buried, they are not very effective." Guerrilla warfare was extremely ineffective.

    After the county conducted a review and study in September, landmine zones were designated. County and district cadres personally took the lead in guiding the militia to study the enemy's patterns of action. If one attempt failed, they would bury landmines again. In mid-September, the first five landmines were detonated in the third district, firing the first shot in the county-wide explosion campaign. On September 22nd, over 500 men from Yan Jun's Zhao Chengshui unit jointly attacked the villages of Nanbeitian. Zhang Hengtian, the director of the Third District Armed Forces Committee, led the militia to set up a minefield. Zhao's troops stepped on it as soon as they entered the village, killing a platoon leader. The militia took advantage of the situation to charge and kill or wound six Yan puppet soldiers. On the 29th, the stubborn county magistrate of Yuci led a police brigade to attack, but they fell into a minefield in Hucun, killing two and seriously wounding 22, leaving them in a terrible state. The county headquarters immediately issued a commendation and selected explosion heroes. In October, landmine warfare was widely launched throughout the county.

  Experience

    The experience gained by Yuci in this campaign is to educate militia cadres to change their understanding of landmines. Leading cadres must personally bury landmines and achieve results. At the beginning of the campaign, meticulous organizational work is also necessary. They transferred explosion experts from the old district militia and formed many explosion teams with new district militia, dividing up explosion areas and designating the enemy and puppet strongholds they were to encircle, making them responsible for strengthening the sense of responsibility and competition. When a team achieved results, the leadership promptly commended and rewarded them (stipulating that a team that detonated a landmine would be awarded 200 silver dollars).

    Secondly, studying the enemy's patterns of activity is the key to carrying out landmine warfare. More minefields should be laid, and more landmines should be buried, without fear of losing them; the reasons for the losses should be reviewed. For example, after the Changning militia studied the characteristics of Yan's puppet troops, ten of the twenty-odd landmines they buried on October 24th were stepped on by Yan's puppet troops. Tian Rongxiao, the director of the Xiangli Village Armed Forces Committee, anticipated that the enemy would definitely come out to seize grain after occupying Changning, so he set up a minefield overnight. On the 29th, when the enemy came to seize grain, the minefield destroyed a machine gun and its gunner, killing or wounding nine people. The next day, the enemy came again. Tian Rongxiao anticipated that they would not take the main road but the small road, and buried landmines that killed two of them, making them afraid to go to Xiangli again.

    Yuci now has two or three healthy explosion teams in each village. Landmines are replenished immediately after they are used. A certain number of landmines are regularly maintained, numbered, distributed, and kept in custody. The militia now prioritize landmine warfare, and combine it with sniper warfare. There are more than ten ways to bury landmines, with step-on mines, bow mines, and pull mines being the ones they use most frequently. (Zhang Zhiyuan)

### 打击阎伪抢粮抓丁凶焰  榆次边地爆炸运动普遍开展  每村经常保有一定数量的地雷以地雷战为第一位结合冷枪战

　　打击阎伪抢粮抓丁凶焰
    榆次边地爆炸运动普遍开展
    每村经常保有一定数量的地雷以地雷战为第一位结合冷枪战
    【本报长治讯】榆次边地民兵爆炸运动已普遍展开。仅十月份即炸响地雷三十一个，炸死炸伤阎伪军营长以下六十九人，得步枪二枝，盒子一架，子弹二百余发，夺回阎伪抢去之粮食一万七千余斤，衣服一百六十余件，这战绩更刺激了榆次人民开展地雷战的热情，他们相信了“地雷真顶事”。家家埋雷，村村爆炸，把榆次平川地区的村庄、道路布置成了一个大的地雷阵，打击了阎伪军出犯抢粮抓丁的凶焰，使其夜间不敢活动，白天亦不敢随便出扰，或随便进村、进院抢掠，要抢就得付出血的代价。
    九月以前，这些战斗对敌人的杀伤并不大，如一、三、四区七十余次战斗消耗子弹二百七、八十发，才杀伤敌人十一名，平均二十五发子弹杀伤一个敌人，民兵子弹来源困难，领导上虽再三提倡地雷，但民兵认为：“平川不好埋雷，埋上也不顶事。”游击战争表现的非常无力。
    九月经过该县检讨研究后，划分了地雷区，县区干部亲自动手领导民兵研究敌人行动规律，一次不行再埋一次，九月中旬第一次在三区炸响了五个地雷，打响了全县爆炸运动的第一炮。九月二十二日阎军赵承绥部五百余人合击南北田村，三区武委会主任张恒田同志带领民兵布置了地雷阵，赵部进村就踏响了，炸死排长一名，民兵乘势冲杀，毙伤阎伪军六人。二十九号榆次顽县长率警察大队出犯，在胡村陷入地雷阵，炸死二人，重伤二十二人，狼狈不堪。该县指挥部即通报表扬，并选出了爆炸英雄。十月，地雷战就在全县普遍开展了。
  经验
    榆次在这一运动中获得的经验，是要教育民兵干部转变对地雷的认识。领导干部必须亲自动手埋雷，做出成绩。运动开展之初，又须有细密的组织工作。他们抽调了老区民兵中的爆炸能手与新区民兵组成许多爆炸组，划分爆炸地区，并指定其围困的敌伪据点，使其负责以加强爆炸责任心与竞赛心。一组获得成绩，领导上及时表扬奖励（规定那组炸响一个地雷奖大洋二百元）。
    其次，研究敌人的活动规律，为开展地雷战的要诀，应多摆地雷阵，多埋雷，不要怕丢，丢了检讨原因。如长凝民兵研究了阎伪的特点后，十月二十四日所埋的廿余个地雷，阎伪就踏响了十个。相立村武委会主任田荣小料定敌占长凝后定要四出抢粮，即连夜布成地雷阵，廿九日敌来抢粮，被炸毁机枪及机枪射手，伤亡九人。次日该敌再来，田荣小又料定其不走大路走小路，埋雷炸死其两人，使其不敢再到相立。
    榆次现在每村有两三个健全的爆炸组。地雷消耗了立即补充。经常保有一定数量的地雷，编号分配保管，现民兵已以地雷战为第一位，而结合了冷枪战。埋雷方法达十余种，以踏雷、弓雷、带雷等为他们经常所使用。（张志远）
