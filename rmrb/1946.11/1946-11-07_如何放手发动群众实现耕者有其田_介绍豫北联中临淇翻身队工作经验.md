How to Boldly Mobilize the Masses to Realize "Land to the Tiller":
    --Introducing the Working Experience of the Linqi Turn-Over Team of the Yubei Joint Middle School
    Yang Daifu

Under the policy of realizing "land to the tiller," the Linqi Turn-Over Team of the Yubei Joint Middle School launched an unprecedentedly large-scale struggle by the peasants of Linqi. The struggle lasted about half a month and went through four stages: ideological mobilization, struggle, distribution of fruits, and summation. The number of participants in the movement was often around one thousand, accounting for about 58 to 65 percent of the number of Linqi peasants who could attend meetings. Seventy-four new activists emerged, an increase of 3.6 times compared with the original number. Among them, 19 were directly promoted from backward elements to activists, accounting for 18 percent, and 70 were middle peasants, accounting for 50 percent. The targets of the struggle were a total of 28 households, of which 25 were landlords, local bullies, and old officials, and 3 were merchants engaged in usury, with a total population of 170, accounting for 6.7 percent of the total population of the village. Now, some experiences and practices worth studying in this movement are briefly introduced as follows:

(1) Accurately assess the situation and propose slogans for struggle.

From the perspective of the landlords in Linqi Town: although the land was weakened in the past rent reduction movement, their momentum was still quite high, and they were very unconvinced. From the perspective of the peasants: although there was indeed some local mobilization in the past movements (mainly a group of about 200 members of the peasant association), a considerable number of poor and extremely poor peasants had not been allocated land and remained in a backward state. Even for the households that had received the most fruits in the past, each person had only barely averaged one mu of land. The vast majority of middle peasants were almost completely outside the movement, and they held great unease and fear about the mass movement as "second crop of leeks" and "small pumpkins." Among the general masses, some even believed that the struggle was a cold shot (you never know who it might hit), and they showed some unease and doubt about the struggle. Therefore, it would be a mistake to think that "the landlords in this village have already collapsed, the land problem has been largely solved, and the masses have been mobilized but not fully." The correct approach should be to affirm the past achievements -- the landlords' land has been greatly weakened, and a large number of activists have emerged. This is the foundation and support for our movement today. However, we must also recognize the basic weakness that the vast majority of peasants have not been mobilized. Based on this situation, we put forward two slogans: one is "equal distribution of land and property of landlords, local bullies, and old officials (local gentry or those who worked in the old government)," and the other is "middle and poor peasants are one family, unite to struggle against landlords, local bullies, and old officials." These two slogans were supported by the vast majority of the masses, and the movement has been developing under these two slogans. Secondly, there are some auxiliary slogans, namely: "Those who have turned over should help those who have not, and those who have not should actively turn over." "Those who have problems should settle accounts with the landlords, and those who have no problems can also be allocated land." "Members of the peasant association should lead everyone to turn over and become heroes of the turn-over." These slogans were not as resounding as the first two, but they also played a great role.

(2) Remove the spiritual shackles of cadres' old experiences and work styles and truly let go.

When the above slogans and practices began to be put forward, they encountered considerable serious doubt and resistance from district and village cadres and individual county-level responsible comrades: The district and village cadres felt that it would be a pleasure to do so, but they always felt that it was a bit awkward to openly say that they would divide the land and property of the landlords. The idea of ​​"land to the tiller" was still illegal in their minds; they even suspected that if we were the only ones doing this, would it be a mistake. In a word: The district and village cadres were seriously bound by the spirit and experience of rent reduction and interest reduction. In terms of ideological mobilization, they stubbornly insisted on waiting until the masses were all awakened or most of them were fairly awakened before starting the struggle, and they affirmed that this awakening must go through liquidation and grievances, and the method must be individual collusion and "bringing together." In fact, this is not suitable for the work base and objective situation in Linqi. I am not saying that this method is completely useless, but it can only be a supplementary and secondary method. The dominant one should be the issue of large-scale action. Letting go should mainly be that the leadership should proceed from the actual situation at that time and place, put forward the most appropriate program of struggle (or slogan), adopt the most appropriate working methods, forms of struggle, and organizational forms, mobilize the broadest masses, and make the struggle reach the appropriate limit. It should be understood that this kind of mobilization and leadership is fundamentally different from taking over everything. The movement in Linqi was launched after these ideas were largely resolved, and these ideas were constantly broken through by facts in the development of the movement. It should be pointed out to the cadres that today's policy of "land to the tiller" is different from the land policy during the Anti-Japanese War. This is a new course for all our cadres. It is obviously lagging behind the objective situation and the demands of the masses to guide today's struggle entirely with the old set of methods. Only by clarifying this issue can we talk about letting go, and will we put our hands to the limit of "land to the tiller." Similarly, only by mastering this new spirit and soul of "land to the tiller" can we be creative in terms of methods and not fall into the quagmire of conservatism. We should regard "land to the tiller" as the working spirit, working method, weapon to mobilize the masses, and the law and reason for peasants to struggle against landlords. Only by grasping this spirit and weapon and unhesitatingly implementing it in action can we truly let go, otherwise it will always be letting go in words.

(3) Start with checking the turn-over, combine class and current affairs education, carry out large-scale ideological mobilization, establish the legal status of "land to the tiller" in the minds of the masses and in public opinion, and create a mighty mass momentum.

In terms of the content of ideological mobilization of the masses: we start with checking the turn-over, letting the activists and the masses recall whether the landlords have succumbed and whether the peasants have turned over. At the same time, we should put forward the standards for turning over: everyone has land to cultivate, everyone has clothes to wear, everyone has food to eat, and everyone has a house to live in. At this time, the peasants will clearly see that the landlords' lives are still ten times better than ours, and then further trace the roots of poverty and wealth. At this time, the peasants, especially the middle peasants, will point out that in the past, the landlords shifted the burden, apportioned the purchase of guns, and used guns to detain the peasants. If a poor or extremely poor peasant is poor because of drug addiction, they will point out that the landlords trafficked drugs and seized their land. At the same time, problems such as high rents and heavy interest will also be raised. This is the common topic for peasants to settle accounts with the landlords. In this way, the issue of "should want" for the peasants is resolved. Combined with current affairs education, take concrete facts (such as the uprising of Chiang Kai-shek's army, etc.) to expose the groundlessness of the special agents' nonsense about the change of sky, and solve the problem of "dare to want" for the peasants. In terms of methods, we openly conduct propaganda and education on "land to the tiller" to the peasants, and announce to the middle peasants that the struggle is for everyone to have land to cultivate, and we will never struggle against the middle peasants. Announce to the landlords: Now we want to realize "land to the tiller." According to past exploitation and liquidation, all your belongings are not enough, so it is better to take them out simply. The masses will leave you food to eat, and you can live honestly by your own labor in the future. In terms of methods, we not only adopt forms such as meetings of activists and mass meetings, but also organize mass parades and demonstrations to strengthen the momentum of the peasants. We not only hold meetings to persuade the landlords, but also let them parade in the streets, so that they and the masses know that the landlords' days are over, so as to suppress their arrogance and make them succumb to the mighty mass momentum.

(4) Issues to be paid attention to in the distribution of fruits and how to distribute fruits.

After the end of the struggle stage, we should enter the stage of distributing the fruits. At this time, we should promote the idea of ​​"filling up" or "supplementing," and should determine "filling up the extremely poor, supplementing the poor peasants, and taking care of the middle peasants." Then, we should combine bottom-up discussions with top-down evaluations to see which households should be filled up. As for how much to fill up, it should be determined based on the amount of struggle fruits. However, in general, we should first fill up according to the average number of mu of land per person in the whole village, and then add grades according to the method of adding grades. We should convert all the property of each household into a certain amount of standard land (middle-grade land). In principle, we should divide it into three grades: extremely poor, poor peasants, and ordinary middle peasants. Newly promoted middle peasants (who have only recently turned over), even if they have more land, should also be taken care of, because they are empty. The method of distribution in Linqi is 4.5 mu of land per person for the extremely poor, 3 mu of land for the poor peasants including the original land, and 2 mu of land for all those above the poor peasants. Those with more than 2 mu will not be distributed. The masses (especially the middle peasants) will initially be dissatisfied with this method of distribution, but when it is explained that the extremely poor are particularly empty, have no food and clothing, and have no farm tools, they will agree. After this distribution of fruits, the poor peasants are very satisfied. However, the difference between the middle peasants (especially the poor middle peasants) and the poor peasants is a bit large, which is still a secondary issue to be remedied.

The housing problem should be dealt with separately, because some have houses but no land, and some have land but no houses, and should be distributed according to the actual situation. In fact, the rural housing problem is a huge problem.

The distribution of fruits is the most complex and delicate work, and it is also a major revolution for the tradition of distributing fruits in this place. Because here, non-members of the peasant association have never been able to share the fruits. Therefore, this practice will be resisted by the old activists. The key is to go through full democratic discussion and democratic decision-making by the masses, focusing on persuading the past activists, otherwise it may cause internal disunity among the peasants, allowing saboteurs to take advantage of the loopholes and causing the evil consequences of mutual opposition among the peasants. The Linqi work this time has flaws in this regard.

(5) Solve the accumulated historical problems in the movement -- unity of middle peasants, mobilization of backward strata, and the relationship between cadres and the masses.

The above three issues are problems accumulated in history, and they are also the problems that some leading comrades are most worried about. There are two main ideas and two methods for solving this problem: one is to solve these problems first (the so-called internal problems) and then unanimously struggle against the landlords. The other is to launch a movement to solve the problems, everything is for the development of the movement, and solve these problems in the movement. We adopted the second method, because some problems cannot be solved by just talking, but must be presented in action for the masses to see before they can be solved. For example, the middle peasant problem. At the beginning of this mobilization, we openly announced to the middle peasants that "we will never struggle against the middle peasants," but the middle peasants still felt some doubt. When the movement unfolded, the awakened elements among the middle peasants narrated how the landlords shifted the burden onto the middle peasants in the past, how they apportioned the purchase of guns, and how they grabbed them to live in the blockhouse, etc., most of the middle peasants' actions gradually became more active. The open mobilization of the "land to the tiller" proposition also played a great role in uniting the middle peasants, because they felt that "now the struggle is for everyone to have land to cultivate. If we struggle against us, won't we have no land to cultivate?" Finally, when distributing the fruits, we should also give appropriate care, otherwise even if we unite temporarily, we will eventually leave. In Linqi, when distributing the fruits, because we initially overemphasized filling up the extremely poor and poor peasants, the middle peasants once left, and then they came back by using the method of care (that is, expanding the scope of distribution, but listing them as the third grade).

The mobilization of the backward strata is the same, we must present the facts. The backwardness of poor peasants is not innate, and we cannot blame them. It is due to the long-term feudal social ignorance education and the weaknesses of past work. After the movement unfolded, their actions tended to be very rapid, because the call of "land to the tiller" and the mighty momentum of the struggle made them feel: "The day of true turn-over has arrived. If we cannot turn over this time, we will never have hope of turning over." Therefore, some backward elements who were silent in the past have become the most active in this movement, especially after the distribution of fruits, they were even more overjoyed.

The solution of the relationship between cadres and the masses also requires facts. For example, the most opinions from the masses in the past were about the chairman of the peasant association, because he had always distributed more fruits. However, this time he handled the problem very fairly, so many masses changed their old views on him, and some even praised him as "selfless."

　　如何放手发动群众实现耕者有其田
    ——介绍豫北联中临淇翻身队工作经验
    杨待甫
    豫北联中临淇翻身队在实现耕者有其田的方针下，发动了临淇农民空前大规模的斗争，历时共约半月，经过了思想动员、斗争、分配果实及总结四个阶段；参加运动人数经常在千人上下，约占临淇农民能参加会议人数的百分之五十八到六十五；积极分子新生长者七十四个，较原来的增加三、六倍，这中间由落后分子直接升成积极分子的有十九个，占百分之十八。中农七十个占百分之五十；斗争对象共二十八家，其中二十五家为地主恶霸老官，三家为商业兼高利贷者，人口共一百七十口，占全村总人口的百分之六点七，现在把这次运动中值得提出研究的一些经验与作法，简括介绍如下：
    （一）准确估计情况，提出斗争口号
    临淇镇就地主方面看：在过去减租运动中土地虽削弱了，但气势还相当高，很不服劲。就农民方面看，在过去的运动中确有局部发动（主要是一批农会会员约二百人），但仍有相当数量的贫农与赤贫一直未分得土地而停留于落后状态。即以过去分得果实最多的户说，每人也才勉强平均一亩地，广大的中农几乎完全站的在运动外面，并以“二茬韭菜”及“小南瓜”的身份对群众运动抱着极大的不安与恐惧。在一般群众中间更有的认为斗争是下冷弹（说不定打着谁），而对斗争表现若干不安与怀疑。因此假如认为“这种村庄地主已经垮了，土地问题大体解决了，群众已经过发动但不充分”，这种笼统看法就会使我们犯错误。正确的应该是肯定过去的成绩——地主土地有极大削弱，生长了大批积极分子，这就是我们今天运动发动的基础与依托，但也必须认识广大农民没有发动起来这个基本弱点。根据这种情况，我们提出了两个口号：一个是“地主恶霸老官（劣绅或在旧政府做过事的）平分土地财产”，一个是“中农贫农是一家，团结起来向地主恶霸老官作斗争”，这两个口号为广大群众所拥护，运动一直在这两个口号下发展着。其次还有一些辅助性的口号，即：“翻了身的要帮助没翻身的，没翻身的要积极起来翻身。”“有问题的要向地主清算，没问题的也可以分到土地”。“农会会员要领导大家翻身，成为翻身英雄”。这几个口号叫的不像前两个响，但也起了很大作用。
    （二）解除干部旧的经验与作风的精神囚笼真正把手放开。
    当以上的口号与作法开始提出时，即遇到了区村干部与个别县级负责同志的相当严重的怀疑与对抗：区村干部觉得这样做倒痛快，但总觉得公开说平分地主的土地财产有些碍口。耕者有其田的主张在他们思想上还是不合法的；甚至怀疑到光咱们这里这样干，是否会犯错误。一句话：区村干部进被减租减息的精神与经验严重的束缚着。在思想发动上他们固执的主张等群众都觉悟了或大部分都相当觉悟了再斗争，而且肯定这种觉悟必须经过清算诉苦，方式上一定要个别串通“团拢”。其实这是不适合于临淇的工作基础与客观形势的要求的。我也不是说这种方式就完全要不得，但是这只能成为国辅助的，次要的方式。而主导的应该是大规模的行动问题。放手主要的应该是领导上从当时当地实际情况出发，提出最适当的斗争纲领（或口号），采取最适当的工作方式斗争形式组织形式，把最广大的群众发动起来，使斗争达到应有的限度，应该了解这种发动与领导和包办是有原则上的区别。临淇的运动就是在大体与解决了这些思想以后才发动起来，而这些思想又在运动的发展中不断的被事实打通着。应该向干部指明，今天的耕者有其田的政策，不同于抗战时期的土地政策，这对我们的全体干部都是一个新的课程，完全用过去的一套来指导今天的斗争显然是落后于客观形势与群众要求的。只有弄清这个问题，才能谈放手，才会把手放到耕者有其田这个限度。同样只有掌握了耕者有其田这个新的精神与灵魂，才能在方式上有所创造，而不陷于保守主义的泥坑。应该把耕者有其田当作工作精神，工作方法，发动群众的武器与农民向地主斗争的法与理，只有掌握了这个精神与武器而毫不犹豫的把它贯彻在行动中去，才能也才算真正把手放开了，否则也将永远是口头上的放手。
    （三）从检查翻身入手，结合阶级时事教育，进行大规模的思想动员，树立“耕者有其田”，在群众思想上与社会舆论上的合法地位，造成浩大的群众声势。
    在群众思想动员的内容上：我们是从检查翻身入手，让积极分子群众回想地主服了没有？农民翻了身没有？同时应该提出翻身的标准就是：人人有地种，人人有衣穿，人人有饭吃，人人有房住。这时农民会很清楚地主的生活还比咱们强十倍，然后进一步追穷根、富根。这时农民，特别中农，会提出过去地主转嫁负担，摊派买枪，又拿枪来扣押农民。有贫农或亦贫是吸毒品穷的，就会提出地主贩运毒品夺去了自己的土地，同时高租重利等问题也会同时提出，这就是农民向地主清算的共同题目。这样就解决了农民“该要”的问题。并结合进行时事教育，拿具体事实（如蒋军起义等）揭破特务的变天胡说之没根据，解决了农民“敢要”这个问题。在动员方式上我们对农民公开进行耕者有其田的宣传教育，对中农宣布斗争就是为的叫人人有地种，决不斗争中农。对地主宣布：现在要实现耕者有其田，按过去剥削清算，全部家当也不够，所以不如干脆拿出来，群众会给你留饭吃，以后可老老实实靠自己劳动过日子。在方式上不仅采用积极分子会议，群众大会等形式，而且组织群众的游行示威，壮大农民声势，对地主不仅开会说服，且让他们游街，让他们和群众都知道地主的日子过到头了，以压低其气焰，使之慑服于浩大的群众声势之下。
    （四）分配果实应注意的问题及如何分配果实。
    斗争阶段结束即应进入分配果实的阶段，这时要向群众宣传“填平”或“补平”的思想，应确定“填平赤贫，补足贫农，照顾中农。”然后应把自下而上的讨论与自上而下的评议结合进行，看那些户主应该填平。至于该填多少，应看斗争果实多少而定。不过一般应先按全村每人平均土地亩数填平，以后再按等往上加等的分法，应把每户的全部财产折成标准地（中等地）若干，原则上应分赤贫、贫农及普通中农以下三等，新升中农（才翻身不久的）即令按地亩较多，也应再加以照顾，因他空虚。临淇的分法是赤贫每人四亩半地，贫农连原有土地补足三亩，贫农以上一律补足二亩，二亩以上者不分。这样分法，群众（特别中农）开始会不满，但当说明了赤贫特别空虚、衣食无着、无农具后，他们是会同意的。这次果实分配后，贫农很满意。但是中农（特别是贫苦中农）和贫农的差额有些大，这还是一个次要补救的问题。
    房屋问题，应作单独处理，因有的有房没地，有的有地没房，应按实际情况分配。实际上农村住房问题是个极大问题。
    分配果实问题是最复杂最细腻的工作，对这个地方分配果实的传统来说也是个大革命。因这里历来是非农会会员分不到果实的，因此，这样做法是会遭到老积极分子的抵抗。关键是要经过群众充分的民主讨论，民主决定，着重说服过去的积极分子，否则即可能引起农民内部的不团结，而使破坏分子有空子可钻，造成农民互相对立的恶果。这次临淇工作在这方面是有缺陷的。
    （五）在运动中解决历史上的积压问题——团结中农，发动落后层及干部与群众关系问题。
    以上三个问题是历史上积压起来的问题，也是有些领导同志最发愁的问题。解决这个问题有两个主张两个办法：一个是先解决了这些问题（所谓内部问题），再一致向地主斗争。一个是开展运动解决问题，一切为了运动的开展，在运动中解决这些问题。我们采取了第二个办法，因为有些问题不是光说能解决，而是要在行动中摆出事实让群众看，然后才能解决。例如中农问题，在这次动员开始，公开向中农宣布“决不斗争中农”，但中农总觉得还有些怀疑。及至运动展开，中农里边觉悟的分子叙述了过去地主如何把负担转嫁在中农身上，如何摊派买枪，又把他抓去住炮楼等等后，大部分中农的行动都渐趋积极。耕者有其田主张的公开动员对团结中农也起了很大作用，因他们觉得“现在斗争就是为的人人有地种，斗了咱们不是咱们也没地种了吗？”最后在分配果实时，也应给以适当照顾，不然即令暂时团结，终究还是要走掉的。临淇在分配果实时，因开始过分强调填平赤贫及贫农，中农曾一度走掉，后来又用照顾（即把分配面扩大，但列为三等）的方法，他们又回来了。
    落后层的发动也是一样，要拿出事实来。穷苦农民的落后不是天生的，不能埋怨他们，即是由于长期的封建社会的愚昧教育及过去工作的弱点造成的。及至运动展开后，他们的行动趋向积极是很急剧的，因耕者有其田的号召及斗争声势的浩大，使他们感到：“这真正翻身的日子到了，如这一次再不能翻身，就永无翻身希望了。”因此过去有一些一言不发的落后分子，在这次运动中一跃而为最积极的了，特别是果实分配后他们更为欢天喜地了。
    干部和群众关系的解决同样要拿事实，例如过去群众意见最多的是对农会主席，因他一贯分的果实多，然而这次处理问题很公正，因而许多群众对他就一改旧观，有些甚至誉之为“大公无私”。
