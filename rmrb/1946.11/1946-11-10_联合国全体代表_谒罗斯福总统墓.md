　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 6th: Chenggong Lake dispatch: Based on the request of Polish representative Lange, the Security Council unanimously agreed at its meeting on the 4th to remove the Franco-Spanish issue from the meeting's agenda so that the UN General Assembly could freely discuss the issue. (According to the UN Charter, the UN General Assembly may not discuss issues that remain on the Security Council's agenda.)
    On Sunday the 3rd, representatives from 51 countries attending the UN General Assembly visited the tomb of the late American President Roosevelt in Hyde Park, outside New York. General Assembly President Spaak laid a wreath in the name of the entire United Nations on the stone monument in front of the tomb. After the ceremony, as other representatives began to enter the house to be received by Mrs. Roosevelt, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, Ambassador to the United States Novikov, and Representative to the Security Council Gromyko, on behalf of the Soviet government, laid a wreath at the tomb and stood for a moment before joining the other representatives. Later, Spaak delivered a speech, and Mrs. Roosevelt gave a reply. Mrs. Roosevelt said: She hoped that the representatives' visit would discover her late husband's spirit and his friendly feelings towards all nations of the world. The General Assembly Steering Committee and all General Assembly committees (except the Legal Committee) resumed their meetings on Monday.
