　　The Eighth Route Army is Back
　　Luo Cuntian
　　While the Battle of Longfeng was raging, I followed the Eighth Route Army to the rear of the Kuomintang army. On the He-Ju highway, the Kuomintang army's supply line, traces of the Kuomintang army's ravages remained. We arrived at Chenji Central Street in Dingtao County. It was silent, with no one to be seen. The doors of the shops were scattered haphazardly across the street, and nine out of ten houses were empty, a scene of desolation. After the troops settled down, the news that "the Eighth Route Army is back" immediately spread among the people. Villagers led cattle and pulled carts, returning one after another from the fields to their battered homes. An hour later, the dead street turned into a bustling market. Vendors selling cigarettes and sesame cakes appeared on the streets, and the masses were pouring out their grievances to the Eighth Route Army. Wives and children were pulling scallions and digging vegetables from the fields by the village to feed their own army, and everywhere was filled with the joy of revival. When the troops arrived at Shatu Settlement (on the He-Ju highway), Old Lady Wang, who was planning to visit relatives, turned back halfway to see the comrades of the Eighth Route Army. After she accused the Kuomintang army of atrocities in the village, she said, "If you hadn't come back, the people would not have been able to survive." The people of the oil mill voluntarily opened their doors, lit their lamps, and stood at the entrance, inviting the Eighth Route Army to come in and rest. An old gentleman in his fifties said to me, "I guessed it was our army as soon as I heard the voice; I hurried out to see our army, and it made me feel happy. If the 'disaster army' came, I would have bolted the door tightly and run from the back wall." The Kuomintang army had taken away the livestock and young people of Shatu Settlement, and they used machine guns to strafe anyone they saw working in the fields. The fields are still deserted, and the wheat has not been sown. The Eighth Route Army immediately lent the livestock to the people to cultivate the land, while guarding the area and helping the masses to thresh the grain and deliver manure to plant wheat. People who had fled to other villages also returned home, tidied up their plows, and prepared to replant wheat. When the troops were about to move, the people gathered in the streets, demanding that the troops never leave.

　　八路军回来了
    罗村田
    龙凤之战打得正激烈的时候，我随着八路军转到了蒋军后方。在蒋军的补给线——荷巨公路上，还留着被蒋军蹂躏以后的痕迹。我们走到定陶县的陈集中街上，鸦雀无声，看不到一个人影，店铺的门板，横七竖八的抛满了街道，十室九空，一片荒凉。队伍住下以后，老百姓立即传出了“八路军回来了”的消息，村民们牵牛拉车，陆续由野外重新回到被捣得破烂不堪的家园。一点钟以后，死街变成了闹市。卖烟卖烧饼的小贩出现在街头，群众在纷纷向八路军哭诉哀曲。老婆孩子们从村边的田野里拔葱刨菜，送给自己的军队吃，到处充满着复活的欢喜。队伍到了沙土集（荷巨公路上），准备去探亲戚的王老太太从半路拐回来看八路军的同志们，她控诉蒋军在村子的暴行后说：“你们再不来，老百姓就活不下去了。”油房老百姓自动开着门，点着灯，站在门口，请八路军进家歇歇。一个五十多岁的老先生对我说：“我一听说话便猜到是咱军队来了；我赶紧跑出来，看看咱的军队心里也是痛快的。要是‘遭殃军’来了，我就把门顶的紧紧的，从后墙就跑了。”蒋军把沙土集的牲口和青年人都拉走了，看到地里做活的人就用机枪扫射，现在田地还荒着，麦子都没种上。八路军马上把牲口借给老百姓耕地，一面警戒，一面帮助群众打场，送粪种麦。逃到别村的人也转回家里，收拾好犁头，准备补种小麦。部队要移动了，老百姓群集街头，要求队伍永远不要离开。
