Factory Labor Model
    Old Huang Zhong Li Hezhi
    Li Hezhi, the top labor model of the Changzhi Bomb Factory, is thirty years old and from Lucheng, Shanxi. He worked in the Taiyuan Arsenal for many years. After the War of Resistance Against Japan, he worked in the Gaoping Fifth Special Commissioner's Office bomb factory for a year, and returned home after the December coup. After the liberation of Changzhi, he joined the revolutionary factory again. He is an active, enthusiastic, and creative worker. Since the increase production movement, his pig iron furnace has seen significant improvements in both output and quality. In March and April, each furnace could only produce 800 to 900 (one furnace every two days). Since the great production movement in May and June, with his efforts, he can produce about 1,600 a day. In August, September, and October, each furnace reached about 2,000. In terms of quality, in the past, 50% of the skins were uneven. After research by him and Li Huirong, they found that the problem of uneven skins was due to the thinness of the core wire. When the molten iron went down, it floated the wire, causing the unevenness. Later, they replaced it with a thicker core wire, and the skins became even. Now, they guarantee that over 80% of the skins are even. In the past, it took a long time to melt the iron, and the output was small and bad. However, after research by him, Li Huirong, and Cui Yichang, the wind nozzle was changed to face upwards (it used to be flat). With a stronger wind, the melting was faster. On the other hand, they studied adding stones to the melting iron, which made the melting faster and cleaner. Therefore, each furnace used to produce only 30 boxes, but now it has increased to 60 boxes. At the same time, it saves labor and coke. Each furnace saves 200 jin of coal, and twelve furnaces save 2,400 jin of coke per month. The kiln used to be fired once a day, but after research, it is now fired every other day, saving 100 jin each time, and 1,200 jin of black coal can also be saved per month for twelve firings. Comrade Hezhi is relatively older, but no matter how cold or hot the weather is, he always works shirtless in the yard, carefully watching the furnace and pouring molten iron. Therefore, everyone calls him the old general Huang Zhong. Although he is often burned, he limps back to work before the burns are completely healed. His work spirit has greatly promoted the completion of the factory's production increase task, and everyone elected him as the top model.

    工厂劳动模范
    老黄忠李何枝
    长治炸弹所劳动模范头名李何枝同志，三十岁，山西潞城人，曾在太原兵工厂干过多年。抗战后他曾在高平五专署炸弹所干了一年，十二月政变回家。解放长治后又参加革命工厂，他是一个积极、热情、有创造性的工人。自增产运动以来，他的化铁炉在产量上、质量上都有显著的提高，三、四月份每炉只能出八、九百（二天一炉）。五、六月份大生产运动以来，在他的努力下一天即能出一千六百左右，八、九、十三个月，每炉即出到了二千左右。在质量上说来，过去是百分之五十皮不匀，后经他和李会荣等研究，找出了皮不匀一合洋一万四千四百元。心的毛病是心丝烧的细了，铁水下去即将他浮起来了故不匀。后来换了粗心丝条，皮即匀了。现在保证百分之八十以上的皮匀了。过去化铁水每炉费时间既长化的又少又怀，可是经过他和李会荣、崔翼昌研究，风嘴口改为朝上（过去是平口），风大了化的快，另一方面又研究化铁掺入石子，化铁即又快又清，因此每炉过去只出卅箱，现已增到六十箱了。同时又节省工和焦炭，一炉省炭二百斤，每月十二炉省焦炭二千四百斤，窑房过去是一天烧一次，现经研究后隔一天烧一次，每一次一百斤，每月十二次亦可省黑炭一千二百斤。何枝同志比较年纪大一些，可是不管在怎样冷和如何炎热的天气里，他老是光着背在院中来往，小心看炉倒铁水。所以大家称他为老将黄忠。他虽经常被烧着，可是未待烧疮全愈即又跛着作工，他的这种工作精神，推动全厂增产任务完成的作用很大，大家选他为模范第一名。
