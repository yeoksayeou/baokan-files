Taiyue, 9th (Our Newspaper Frontline Correspondent Group Report) : The Chiang Kai-shek troops who occupied Hongdong recently ordered their special agent henchmen to organize "military-civilian cooperation stations" in order to plan for local grain and cloth to solve their supply difficulties. However, because the people in most villages fled, leaving only the old and weak, Chiang Kai-shek's conspiracy ultimately failed. The Chiang Kai-shek troops then used armed forces to forcibly organize [these stations] in various villages, but because the old and weak had hidden themselves, the Chiang Kai-shek troops adopted night encirclements. Last month, they encircled villages near Subao, such as Guopen, arrested hostages, and forced [the villagers] to establish [these stations]. They have now begun to requisition hemp rope, cotton, and cash from various villages, setting deadlines for payment. Currently, the people of Hongdong are carrying out a more thorough emptying of houses and fields, so that the Chiang Kai-shek troops cannot even get water to drink.

    洪洞人民空室清野粉碎蒋军以战养战
    【本报太岳九日电】同蒲前线记者团报导：进占洪洞之蒋军，近命令其特务爪牙组织“军民合作站”，以便就地筹划粮食布匹，解决其补给困难，但因大部村庄人民逃避一空，有人亦仅余老弱，蒋军阴谋终未得逞，蒋军乃以武装到各村强迫组织，但因老弱都已藏起，蒋军又采取夜间包围，上月曾将苏堡附近之郭盆等村包围，抓捕人质，强迫成立，现已开始向各村征派麻绳、棉花及现款，限期交纳，现洪洞老百姓正在进行更深入一步的空室清野，作到使蒋军连水也喝不上。
