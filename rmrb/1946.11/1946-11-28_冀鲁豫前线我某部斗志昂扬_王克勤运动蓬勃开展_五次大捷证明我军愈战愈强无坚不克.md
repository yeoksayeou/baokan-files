[Report from our correspondent on the Jilu-Yu Front, dated 26th] Our troops on the Jilu-Yu front are in high spirits and the Wang Keqin movement is thriving. Five major victories prove that our army is becoming stronger and invincible.

[This newspaper's dispatch from the Jilu-Yu Front, dated the 26th] The 22nd marked the 100th day since the start of the counter-offensive and self-defense campaign on the Longhai Railway. Our reporter had the opportunity to interview a military commander of our field army on the front lines, who stated: "Since our unit victoriously launched the self-defense counter-attack at Lanfeng on the Longhai Front on August 11th, we have successively achieved complete victories in three subsequent blocking actions, including the one at Baimaoji. After their defeats, Chiang's troops launched an all-out attack, resulting in the Dayanghu, Longfeng, Juancheng, and now the Hua County campaigns, in which we annihilated his crack 3rd Division. In these 100 days, our army has fought north and south, achieving victory after victory. On average, a major campaign occurred every 20 days. We captured nearly 1,000 Chiang's officers and soldiers of all ranks (casualties not included), and seized 450 light machine guns, 150 heavy machine guns, over 40 mortars, 3 field guns, 4 anti-tank guns, over 10 tanks, 1 howitzer, over 4,000 rifles, and over 1 million rounds of ammunition. All the ammunition used by our unit since the start of the fighting has been fully replenished by 'transport captain' Chiang Kai-shek. At the same time, we have recovered two county towns and over 40 strongholds. Our army's combat effectiveness is growing stronger with each battle, morale is rising, and our tactical guidance and technical application are improving with each engagement. We have absorbed the experience from the five battles since Lanfeng in our tactical guidance, laying the foundation for a general counter-offensive in the future." He then cited the battles of Lanfeng and Shangguancun in Hua County as examples, saying: "Lanfeng had only one water-filled moat and one stockaded village, with a pond inside the village and bunkers on top. Shangguancun, on the other hand, had nineteen bunkers and three rows of barricades on the first line, a water-filled moat with hidden bunkers every 50 to 100 meters on the second line, and a stockaded village with hidden bunkers and crenellations on top and an outer moat underneath on the third line. There were also communication trenches inside the village, bunkers at every intersection with gaps on the streets, and firepower points constructed using the high ground of the houses. There was even a row of barricades in front of the brigade commander's entrance. Such a solid fortification was breached by us from 6:05 am to 7:00 am on the 18th, and the battle ended at 11:00 am on the 19th. No one escaped, from the brigade commander to the cooks and grooms. It can be considered the most beautiful, decisive, and thorough victory since the five battles. Our casualties were lower than at Lanfeng, while the results were several times greater, and we obtained a large replenishment of weapons and ammunition. This battle gave us a great test. No matter how solid the enemy's stronghold, we will definitely be able to take it down if we want to." When talking about the reasons for such brilliant achievements, he stated: "In addition to the wise command of Commanders Liu and Deng, the 'Wang Keqin Movement' played a significant role in the unit. Veteran soldiers carefully led new soldiers in combat. In addition, there are three mutual aid groups in each squad, composed of both new and veteran soldiers. The group leader is elected by the soldiers themselves, and the mutual aid content includes marching, combat, eating, sleeping, learning, and other aspects. The method of veteran soldiers leading new soldiers is adopted, and new and veteran soldiers help and learn from each other. The mutual aid group is a study group in peacetime and becomes a combat group in wartime. New soldiers can fight as well as veteran soldiers after only fifteen days of training (according to prisoners, Chiang's soldiers need at least a year of training before they can fight), and combat casualties are reduced by one-third compared to the Longhai campaign. Currently, all members of the unit, from senior cadres to soldiers, are studying 'Wang Keqin's leadership methods.' Combat morale is unprecedentedly high, and new and veteran soldiers are unprecedentedly united. There are very few desertions. As soon as the battle ends, they immediately enter training to study and summarize experience. Communication and liaison ensure simultaneous action within one or two minutes." In conclusion, he said: "In short, we are getting stronger and stronger with each battle, while the enemy is getting weaker and weaker. Although the enemy has temporarily occupied some of our cities, once their forces are depleted to a certain extent, we can launch a full-scale general counter-offensive, and the demise of Chiang's army will be inevitable."

　　冀鲁豫前线我某部斗志昂扬
    王克勤运动蓬勃开展
    五次大捷证明我军愈战愈强无坚不克
    【本报冀鲁豫前线二十六日电】二十二日为陇海线反击自卫战役开始以来之第一百日，记者特于前线访晤我野战兵团某部军事首长，承发表谈话称：“自八月十一日我部从陇海前线之兰封自卫反击战胜利展开以后，接着又在白矛集等三次阻击战均获完满胜利。蒋军于失败之余，又倾巢来犯，遂又有歼灭其嫡系整三师之大杨湖战役、龙凤战役、鄄城战役及此次之滑县战役。百日之内，我军纵横南北，连战皆捷；平均每二十天内，即有一次大的战役。被我俘虏之蒋军将校尉各级军官将近一千名、士兵八九千名（伤亡未统计），缴获轻机枪四百五十挺、重机枪一百五十挺、迫击炮四十余门、步兵炮三门、反坦克炮四门、坦克十余辆、榴弹炮一门、步枪四千余支、弹药一百余万发，我部自作战以来，所用弹药，皆全部为‘运输队长’蒋介石所补充。同时，并收复县城两个、据点四十多个。我军战斗力愈战愈强，士气愈打愈旺盛，战术指导及技术运用上则愈战愈加提高，我们在战术指导上吸收了自兰封以来五次战役的经验，已打下为将来总反攻的基础。”他接着以兰封及滑县上官村战斗为实例，谈称：“兰封只有一道水壕，一道围砦，围砦内有池子，围砦上有碉堡。而上官村则第一线是十九个碉堡三道鹿砦，第二线是水壕，壕里有暗堡（五十米到百米一个），第三线是围砦，围砦上有暗堡和垛口，围砦下有外壕，砦内还有交通壕，街道上十字街口凡有空隙处都有地堡垒，并利用房屋的制高点构筑火力点，旅长的门口还有一道鹿砦。这样坚固的工事，从十八日六时五分开始到七点，就被我击破了，十九日十一时午结束战争。蒋军从旅长到伙夫马夫无一漏网，可算是五次战役以来打得最漂亮、干脆、彻底的一次。我们的伤亡比兰封为小，而战果则超过数倍，武器弹药又得了大量的补充。此次战斗给了我们很大一个考验，不管敌人怎样坚固的据点，我们要打下就一定能打下。”谈到战绩如此辉煌的原因时称：“主要的除了刘邓首长的英明指挥以外，这次‘王克勤运动’在部队展开的作用很大，老战士都细心带领新战士作战；此外在部队中每班都有三个互助组，由新老战士共同组成，组长由战士自己选举，互助内容包括行军作战、吃饭睡觉、学习等各方面，采取老战士带新战士的办法，新老战士互相帮助，互相学习。互助组平时为学习组，战时就变成战斗组。新战士只要训练十五天后，就能和老战士一样的作战（据俘虏谈：蒋军士兵最少得训练一年多才能作战），战斗伤亡比陇海战役减少三分之一。目前全部队中从高级干部到战士都学习‘王克勤的领导方法’，战斗情绪空前高涨，新老战士空前团结，很少逃亡现象。战斗一经结束，即马上进入整训，研究总结经验。通讯联络保证了在一两分钟内同时动作”。最后结语称：“总之，我们是愈打愈强，敌则愈战愈弱。敌虽暂时占我一些城市，但一到其兵力消耗至一定程度时，我即可举行全面总反攻，蒋军覆灭即不可免。”
