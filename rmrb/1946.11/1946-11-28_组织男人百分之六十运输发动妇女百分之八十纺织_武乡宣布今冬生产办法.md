　　To implement the "cultivate for three, surplus for one" policy and lay the foundation for large-scale production next year, the Wuxiang County government recently announced two-month winter production measures. First, it emphasized that winter production should be coordinated with participation in the war, and all production efforts should strive for victory in the patriotic self-defense war. It then proposed that winter production tasks should account for one-third of the total annual income. Specific measures include: (1) Organizing 60% of the county's 39,000 able-bodied laborers in the transportation industry to extensively carry out various transportation activities within the county and neighboring counties, such as transporting coal, charcoal, and promoting the sale of mountain goods. Each laborer earning 140 yuan per day can earn a total of 16,830,000 yuan. (2) Deeply promoting the idea of "To get rich, weave cloth and spin cotton," and organizing 80% of the county's adult women to spin and weave. Each person spinning one jin of cotton in six days, 25,000 people can earn 250,000 jin of cotton, worth 75 million yuan (calculated at 300 yuan per jin). (3) Cooperatives are estimated to earn at least one yuan for every three yuan invested. The county has 140 cooperatives with a total capital of 490 million yuan, which can earn 16 million yuan. (4) Other activities include boiling 70 pots of saltpeter, yielding an estimated 170,000 jin, earning 27 million yuan; 1,500 miners earning 250 yuan per day each, totaling 25 million yuan; and increasing pig farming by 540 pigs throughout the county, earning 5 million yuan. If the above is divided among the county's 115,000 people, the average person earning 3,000 yuan will complete the task.
