The KMT Army's Insatiable Grain Demands and Extortions, Even More Afraid of Our Guerrillas and Militia's Unpredictable Appearances
Returning Landlords Dare Not Organize Puppet Regimes

[Our dispatch] The village administrations in the KMT-occupied areas around Anyang and Jiaozuo are mostly still in the hands of the masses. Landlords from the eighth and ninth districts of Anyang, who returned with the KMT army from areas like Zhangde and Tangyin, were immediately asked by the KMT army to repay "ammunition fees for returning home" as soon as they arrived in the villages. In Xiazhai, in the sixth district of Anyang, landlords who had just returned home were immediately pursued by the KMT army to demand grain payments. Because the masses had already been moved away, the landlords were driven to desperation and unable to cope. They dared not organize puppet regimes to shoulder the KMT army's insatiable extortions. A landlord in ×× village in the tenth district of Anyang, after becoming the village head, couldn't bear the KMT army's oppression, beatings, and scoldings, and had to hire someone else to be the village head at a high price. Jiaozuo's militia forces frequently engaged the enemy and spread news of our army's victories deep behind enemy lines, greatly encouraging the masses and shaking the confidence of those participating in the puppet regime. Two village heads in ×× village pushed the responsibility onto each other, unwilling to do the job. The village head of ×× village sent us a letter saying, "Any difficulties can definitely be solved." Many non-armed landlords returning to Anyang, fearing the unpredictable attacks of the Eighth Route Army guerrillas and militia, dared not stay after looting the masses' property and fled again immediately. Generally, the landlords who remained in the villages constantly heard news of our army's victories and had no confidence in the "Chiang family's regime." Most dared not offend the masses, adopted a neutral attitude, dared not reverse the accounts, and dared not organize puppet regimes. The masses in the enemy-occupied areas of Jiaozuo secretly sent letters to their children and families, saying, "Follow the Eighth Route Army to the end and fight back to Jiaozuo!" They also sent intelligence and inquired about news for our army. Due to the KMT army's extortion of returning landlords and the activities of our militia behind enemy lines, puppet regimes have not been established in the KMT-occupied areas to this day, and the ones that have been established in individual villages are in a precarious situation.
(Shi Hong, Hong Dong)

[Another dispatch] After the KMT puppet troops trampled into the liberated area of Anyang, they levied taxes and extorted contributions, causing everyone to complain bitterly. In Donghuiying in the fourth district, which has less than two hundred households, the village was ordered to purchase six machine guns at a price of 1 million yuan in legal tender per gun, more than sixty rifles at 350,000 yuan per rifle, and 15,000 rounds of ammunition in one go, and to pay 36 million yuan in grain. Most of these funds were allocated to middle and lower-middle peasant masses, but apart from a few local bullies, KMT secret agents, and landlords, even general small and medium landlords could not escape. A few landlords who stayed in villages such as Xiayao in the sixth district could not cope with the KMT puppet troops' extortion, so they left the KMT puppet troops under the pretext and fired machine guns outside the village, returning to tell the KMT army, "The Eighth Route Army is here!" This frightened the KMT puppet troops into chaos, and they temporarily forgot about the extortion.

　　一怕蒋军催粮讨款无厌勒索更怕我游击队民兵神出鬼没
    还乡地主不敢组织伪政权
    【本报讯】安阳及焦作周围蒋占区村政权大部仍掌握在群众手中。随蒋军由彰德、汤阴等地还乡的安阳八、九区地主，刚一到村，蒋军便向他们索还“还乡弹药费”。安阳六区夏寨还乡地主刚进家，蒋军便追去催讨粮款，因群众已转移出去，逼得他们焦头烂额无法应付，更不敢组织伪政权担负蒋军无厌的勒索。安阳十区××村地主当保长后吃不消蒋军压榨、打骂，只得重价雇用别人当保长。焦作民兵武装经常接敌活动，深入敌后传播我军胜利消息，大大鼓舞了群众和动摇了参加伪政权人员，××村两个保长互相推诿，谁也不愿干，××村保长捎信给我们说：“有啥困难一定能解决。”安阳许多还乡的非武装地主，害怕八路军游击队和民兵神出鬼没的袭击，抢到群众财物后不敢驻脚即复逃亡。留在村里的一般地主，不断听到我军胜利消息，对“蒋家天下”没有信心，多不敢得罪群众，采取中间态度，不敢倒算账，亦不敢组织伪政权。焦作敌后群众暗地给孩子家人等捎信说：“跟着八路军干到底，打回焦作来！”并给我军送情报，探消息。由于蒋军对还乡地主的勒索，及我民兵敌后的活动，故蒋占区伪政权至今建立不起来，个别村庄建立起来的亦处于风雨飘摇之中。

    【又讯】蒋伪军兽蹄踏进安阳解放区后，横征暴敛，人人叫苦。四区东灰营不到二百户，一次便派该村购买机枪六挺，每挺作价法币百万元，步枪六十余枝、每枝三十五万，子弹一万五千发，并派粮款三千六百万元。这些款，大部派给中农以下群众，但除少数恶霸、蒋特地主外，一般中小地主亦不能逃脱。六区夏窑等村少数留村地主，无法应付蒋伪军之勒索，便借故离开蒋伪军，在村外打了机枪，回去给蒋军说：“八路军进来了！”吓的蒋伪军大乱一阵，而一时忘记勒索。
