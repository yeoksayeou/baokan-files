    Lucheng No. 1 High School
    Self-Sufficiency in Vegetable, Cooking Oil, and Lamp Oil Production
    [Report from Changzhi by our newspaper] Under the guidance of the new education policy, Lucheng County No. 1 High School, in terms of agricultural production, has already achieved complete self-sufficiency in vegetables, cooking oil, and lamp oil. It is also preparing to plant "Golden Queen" corn, 169 wheat, and cotton. The school will combine scientific knowledge to improve and enhance production techniques. At the same time, it has proposed a production incentive method that takes into consideration both public and private interests, with a 30/70 profit split (30% for the school, 70% for the students), in order to consolidate production achievements. In the future, the school will also strengthen the production of handicrafts and sideline occupations to ensure that students' textbooks and stationery are entirely supplied by the school.

    【本报长治讯】潞城县立第一高小在此次新教育方针的指导下，农业生产方面，除菜蔬灯油已做到全部自给外，还准备种金皇后玉茭，一六九小麦，及棉花等。结合科学知识，改良和提高生产技术。同时提出公私兼顾三七分红的生产奖励办法（学校三学生七），以巩固生产成绩。今后且要加强手工业与副业的生产，做到学生的课本文具完全由学校供给。
