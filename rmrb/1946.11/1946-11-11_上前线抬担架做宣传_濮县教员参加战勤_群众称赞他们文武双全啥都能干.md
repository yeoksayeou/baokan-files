    [This Newspaper's Dispatch from the Ji-Lu-Yu Area on the 9th] During this self-defense war, primary school teachers in Puyang County not only followed stretchers to the front lines five times to carry out propaganda and mobilization work but also directly participated in carrying stretchers. According to statistics, in the fifth, sixth, and seventh districts alone, there were as many as thirty-eight teachers participating in war support stretcher work. In addition to doing propaganda and education work at the front, they also participated in various stretcher team tasks, playing a exemplary role. Teachers Wang Jingtang and Miao Zhuoran, among others, handled supplies for the stretcher team. Despite having sores on their feet, they frequently crossed deep water to collect flour, ensuring that the stretcher bearers were not hungry, and they took good care of sick comrades. Teachers Su Weikong and Dong Wenxian played an exemplary role in handling matters and provided explanations to the stretcher bearers, setting a leading example. Feng Xiwen, a teacher from a higher primary school in the first district, followed the stretcher team to the front line, led everyone in air defense, and personally carried stretchers. Due to their exemplary actions, they truly integrated with the stretcher bearers, working day and night, enduring hardships first, and never falling behind in anything. The stretcher bearers were exceptionally fond of them, and the masses' perception of them greatly changed. They said, "Teachers now are different from the past. They are like the people from the Federation District Department, capable of everything and versatile." The teachers also happily said, "In the future, as long as the higher authorities assign us work, we will definitely complete it."
    [Xinhua News Agency, Central China Electric] Teachers in various counties of the Fifth Sub-district of Suwan have risen up to participate in the war to defend their lives and teaching freedom, helping with logistics in the self-defense war. In Yeting County, over two hundred primary school teachers have formed teachers' work teams in each district. Thirty-five teachers have already gone to the front lines with civilian laborers and militia war participation groups. In Funing County, over fifty primary school teachers have voluntarily organized battlefield service teams to educate civilian laborers on how to carry stretchers and care for the sick and wounded. They use various methods such as cartoons, slogans, ditties, and speeches to reflect reality and educate the masses, which has been very effective. For example, the astonishing story of Wang Ying, a nineteen-year-old militiaman from Huangpu District in Funing, who delivered dry rations to the front line overnight during a Chiang Kai-shek air raid, has become more familiar and praised by the people of the county after being adapted into a drama by them. All teachers and students of the Jianyang Fudong Primary School's Agricultural Textile School have also organized propaganda teams and work groups to undertake cultural and educational work on the battlefield.

    上前线抬担架做宣传
    濮县教员参加战勤
    群众称赞他们文武双全啥都能干
    【本报冀鲁豫九日电】濮县小学教员在这次自卫战争中，不仅随着担架到前方五次，进行宣传鼓动工作，并直接参加了抬担架。统计全县教员参加战勤担架工作的，仅五、六、七三个区，即有三十八人之多，他们在前方除了做宣传教育工作外，还参加了担架队的各种工作，起了模范作用。王景堂、苗卓然等教员，给担架队搞供给，他们脚上有疮，但经常过深水去领面，保证担架员不挨饿，对有病的同志照顾的也很周到。粟维孔、董文献教员遇事起模范作用，向担架员进行解释，起了带头作用。一区高小教员冯喜文跟担架到火线，带领大家防空，并亲自抬担架下来。由于他们的这些模范行动，与担架员真正打成一片，白天黑夜的工作，吃苦在前，啥事也不落人后，担架队员对他们异常的亲热，群众对他们的看法也大大变了。他们说：“现在教员和过去不一样了，他们和联合会区部的人一样，啥都能干、文武双全了”。教员们也都高兴的说：“今后只要上级分配我们工作，我们一定能完成。”
    【新华社华中电】苏皖五分区各县教师，为保卫自己的生活和教学自由，均奋起参战，帮助自卫战中的后勤工作。叶挺县二百余小学教师，成立了各区教师工作队，三十五位教师，已随民夫民兵参战团走上前线。阜宁县五十余小学教师，自动组织战地服务团，进行民夫教育，怎样抬担架爱护伤病员等。他们用漫画、标语、小调、演说等各种方式，来反映现实教育群众，收效颇大。如阜宁黄浦区，十九岁的小民兵王英，在蒋机轰炸时连夜给前线运送干粮的惊人故事，经他们编剧之后，更为全县人民所熟习和称颂。建阳阜东小学校农纺专校全体师生，亦分别组织宣传队工作组，担任战场上的文教工作。
