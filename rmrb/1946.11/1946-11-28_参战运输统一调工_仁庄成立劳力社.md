　　Unified Labor Allocation for War Participation and Transportation
    Ren Zhuang Establishes Labor Cooperative

    [Report from this newspaper in Changzhi] After the autumn harvest, the Shen Ruixian Mutual Aid Team of Renzhuang, Licheng, discussed establishing a labor cooperative, adopting a unified method of calculating work points for war participation, transportation, handicraft production, and mutual assistance at home, in order to resolve the contradiction between transportation and war participation. The entire team consists of twenty-four households, eighteen full laborers, three half laborers, and fifteen livestock, including nine large carts, forming a labor cooperative. The cooperative has an oil mill and a flour mill, each requiring two people and one livestock, as well as a cotton gin, requiring two people, and seven large carts forming a transportation team. The remaining labor and livestock are engaged in miscellaneous work at home, serving as reserves for war participation and transportation.
    The method of calculating work points is to set standard points for each task, and the money earned is distributed according to the total points. That is, transporting one hundred catties per day counts as ten points, and participating in the war or milling flour counts as ten points per person per day. Recently, an accounting was done, showing that one hundred and sixty workdays were used in six days, earning 31,200 yuan, with an average of 320 yuan per workday, which everyone was very satisfied with. In particular, Shen Chunxi, upon returning from transportation, was happy to see that the public grain rice had also been milled, saying, "Money has been earned, and public affairs have been handled." The old man Shen Erhu was initially unwilling to participate, but seeing that his livestock was out for transportation and someone was helping him with errands, he also joined. Everyone saw the benefits, and now they plan to open another flour mill and a tofu workshop, and also raise pigs to accumulate fertilizer. After hearing about this, nearby villages such as Dongwang Baojiajiao sent people to learn from them.

　　参战运输统一调工
    仁庄成立劳力社
    【本报长治讯】黎城仁庄申锐贤互助队于秋后讨论成立劳力合作社，采用参战运输、手工生产、在家互助做活的统一计工折工办法，以解决运输与参战的矛盾。全队廿四户，十八个全劳力，三个半劳力，十五个牲口，大车九辆，合组成一个劳力合作社。社内有油坊，磨坊各一座，各需人两个、牲口一头、另有轧花车一架，需人两个，七辆大车组成一个运输队。其余劳畜力在家做杂活，作为参战及运输的后备。
    折工办法是各项工作都定出标准分，赚了钱按总分分。即每天运输一百斤作十分，参战、磨面一个人一天顶十分。最近算了一次帐，六天用工一百六十个，获利三万一千二百元，每工平均三百二十元，大家很满意。特别是申春喜运输回来，看见公粮米也碾了，高兴的说：“钱也赚了，公事也办了。”申二虎老汉开头不愿参加，看到自己牲口出去运输，有人替他支差，他也参加了。大家都看到有利，现计划再开一座磨坊，一座豆腐坊，还要养猪积肥。附近东旺暴家脚等村听到后，都派人去学习。
