Qiu County Cadres Discuss the Current Situation
　　Voluntarily Take an Oath
　　Everything for Victory
　　[Our newspaper, Weixian, 25th dispatch] All county and district cadres in Qiu County gathered to study the current situation, study the "On the War Situation" editorial in the Liberation Daily, and the calls from the District Party Committee meeting, as well as to examine their thinking. Every comrade conducted a thorough self-examination, correcting feelings of paralysis, relaxation, laxity, complacency, and peaceful illusions. Finally, under conscious and voluntary circumstances, an oath-taking movement was launched. Everyone solemnly read their oaths before Chairman Mao's portrait, vowing to fight the reactionary Chiang and American forces to the end with a hundredfold confidence. The general direction of everyone's efforts in the oaths includes the following points: (1) Establishing a worldview of serving the broad masses of working people, resolutely following Chairman Mao. (2) Absolutely subordinating personal interests to the interests of the work, not creating personal problems, and uniting together. (3) Establishing confidence in victory, adhering to positions in any situation, not wavering, not retreating, and vowing to share the joys and sorrows and live and die with the people. (4) Fully mobilizing the masses, launching mass-based work to eliminate traitors and counter-revolutionaries, and consolidating our positions. (5) Practicing thrift and working hard in production, everything to support the front lines, and striving for the early victory of the people's patriotic self-defense war.
