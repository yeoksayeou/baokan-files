　　Glimpses of the Mass Movement Experience in the Sixth District of En County
    The mass movement in the Sixth District of En County has created a major momentum, and has come to an end by the end of September. Villages are accelerating the distribution of fruits and transitioning to consolidating their organizations. In the past half month, the following insights have been gained: First, the consolidation of organizations includes four aspects: holding "thinking sessions," implementing citizen registration, criticism meetings, and democratic life. According to the results of the Gaozhuang sub-district experiment, "thinking sessions" are the most effective way to raise farmers' awareness and consolidate the ideological front of the peasants, but they must be implemented in all work; citizen registration can create a mass anti-special agent movement, isolate bad people, and win over coerced elements; criticism meetings and democratic life mainly cultivate democratic habits among the masses and strengthen the connection between activists and the masses. Second, according to the experience of eleven villages, the distribution of fruits should be as quick and direct as possible. It is best to distribute them as soon as they are obtained. Both assets and land should be directly distributed. When landlords hand over their land, old contracts must be abolished and new contracts re-established. Third, some middle peasants, due to instigation and intimidation by landlords, wanted to voluntarily dedicate their land. After a joint meeting of activists, the masses shouted, "Fight the big, not the small, fight the bad, not the good." The emotions of the middle peasants gradually stabilized. Fourth, in the new district, 70 to 80 percent of villages have mobilized women in the peasant movement. According to the experience of Gaozhuang sub-district in mobilizing women, after the peasants are mobilized, there should be a conscious effort to spread the message "Now that the peasants have turned over, women must also turn over." The general method is to persuade activists to mobilize their wives and sisters to take the lead, or to promote the linking and preparation of family members of soldiers and abused daughters-in-law, so as to enable them to participate in the struggle.

　　恩县六区群运经验点滴
    恩县六区群运大动局面，截止九月底已告一段落，各村正从速分配果实，转入巩固组织。半月来取得如下点滴经验：一、巩固组织内容有四：开“想想会”，实行公民登记，批评会及民主生活。经高庄小区试验结果，“想想会”是提高农民觉悟，巩固农民思想阵地的最有效办法，但必须贯彻在一切工作中去；公民登记，能造成群众性的反特运动，孤立坏人，争取胁从分子；批评会与民主生活，主要养成群众民主的习惯，密切积极分子与群众的联系。二、果实分配，根据十一个村的经验，越迅速越直接越好，最好作到随得随分，资财和土地都采取直接分配，地主交出土地一定将旧文契废除，重新建立新契约。三、有的中农因受地主挑拨恐吓，想自动献田，经积极分子联席会后，群众喊出：“斗大不斗小，斗坏不斗好。”中农情绪逐渐稳定下来。四、新区妇女在农民大动中，十分之七八的村动起来。据高庄小区发动妇女的经验，在农民行动起来后，应有意识的传播“农民翻了身，妇女也要翻。”一般的方式采用说服积极分子动员自己的老婆姊妹带头，或推动抗属和受气的媳妇串连酝酿，以便使之参加斗争。
