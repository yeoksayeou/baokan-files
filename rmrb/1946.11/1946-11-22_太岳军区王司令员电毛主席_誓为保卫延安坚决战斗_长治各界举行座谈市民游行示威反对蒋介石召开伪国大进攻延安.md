　　Commander Wang of the Taiyue Military Region Cables Chairman Mao
	Vowing to Fight Resolutely to Defend Yan'an
	People from All Walks of Life in Changzhi Hold Symposiums and Citizens March and Demonstrate Against Chiang Kai-shek's Convening of the Pseudo-National Assembly and Offensive Against Yan'an
	[Our Yangcheng Dispatch, 20th] The news of Chiang Kai-shek's attack on Yan'an, the sacred site of democratic China, has filled the three million soldiers and civilians of Taiyue with righteous indignation. Commander Wang Xinting and Political Commissar Wang Hefeng of the Military Region sent a telegram to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and Deputy Commander-in-Chief Peng in Yan'an on the 17th, vowing to serve as the rear guard of the border region and smash the enemy's offensive. The original telegram is as follows:
	Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and Deputy Commander-in-Chief Peng: Chiang Kai-shek, the traitorous, war-mongering, and dictatorial leader, dares to attack the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, the sacred site of democratic China, Yan'an. The soldiers and civilians of Taiyue are filled with righteous indignation upon hearing this news. Our region's three million soldiers and civilians vow to serve as the rear guard of the border region and have now urgently mobilized to enthusiastically join the war and the army, launching a campaign to annihilate the enemy, smash the enemy's offensive, and vow to fight resolutely to the end to defend the border region, defend Yan'an, defend the Party Central Committee, and defend Chairman Mao!
	[Our Changzhi Dispatch] After hearing the news of Chiang Hu's army attacking Yan'an, all circles in Changzhi City held a symposium on the morning of the 16th to oppose Chiang Kai-shek's attack on Yan'an. Representatives from workers, shop assistants, emancipated peasants, Hui people, students, and members of the Border Region Assembly, Mr. Ma Shaotang and Mr. Li Wuqing, totaling more than 90 people, attended the meeting. At the meeting, the chairman first gave a brief report on the situation of Chiang Kai-shek's dispatching troops to attack Yan'an. Everyone scrambled to speak. A worker representative said, "We, the entire workers, organize pickets and self-defense teams, determined to fight Chiang Kai-shek." An emancipated peasant representative, An Zigang, said, "Chiang Kai-shek's attack on Yan'an relies on American assistance. Japan was defeated by us in the past, and now we have all turned over. We have even more power to tell the American reactionaries to get out." An emancipated Hui representative, Ma Huaigen, first compared his past and present life. He slammed the table angrily and said, "Chairman Mao led us to turn over. The opposition wants to seize our land and eliminate our Hui people. The emancipated Hui people will vow to fight him to the death." A gentry representative, Mr. Hao Zhuqing, analyzed the current civil war situation and briefly stated: "Chiang Kai-shek's attack on the Liberated Areas is for the sake of American imperialism, and our implementation of self-defense is for the people. We will surely win." After he finished speaking, the atmosphere at the meeting was exceptionally angry. Each representative successively swore to express their practical actions to oppose Chiang Kai-shek's attack on Yan'an. Students from Changzhi Normal School decided to go to the countryside to help the masses quickly and thoroughly turn over. Merchant representatives stated: Do not buy or sell American goods, and practice thrift. Industrial representative Cui Guiyuan continued, "We in the industrial sector will mobilize, implement labor-capital cooperation, improve tools, and increase production to support the front lines." Women's representative Meng Guozhen said: Women participate in the emancipation movement. Later, Deputy Mayor Huo of Changzhi City called on everyone to break any illusions about peace with Chiang Kai-shek, fight tensely, defend the Liberated Areas, defend Yan'an, and strive for the victory of the overall resistance. Finally, two telegrams were passed. First, a telegram was sent to the whole country opposing the pseudo-National Assembly convened by the Kuomintang. Second, a telegram was sent to the United Nations requesting the United Nations to uphold justice and let the American army quickly withdraw from Chinese territory. The meeting did not end until 3 p.m. That evening, more than 5,000 citizens of Changzhi City held a march and demonstration, resolutely opposing Chiang Kai-shek's attack on Yan'an.
