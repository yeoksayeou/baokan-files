　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st. Reuters, New York, 29th: The Kuomintang delegation attending the United Nations General Assembly issued a statement on the evening of the 29th stating that they "disagree with the opinion expressed by the Byelorussian delegation at the General Assembly on the 28th that the remaining of US troops in China violates the United Nations Charter. The whole world knows that the presence of US troops in China is with China's consent, and they are responsible for disarming Japanese troops in China and sending Japanese troops and expatriates back to their country. As these tasks are gradually completed in various parts of China, US troops have been reduced and withdrawn, and only a small number of them remain in China now. US troops have not participated in any conflicts between government troops and Communist troops. On the contrary, the US representative in China has made great efforts to mediate and peacefully resolve China's political disputes, which is very grateful."

    蒋政府代表真无耻  竟为美军驻华辩护
    【新华社延安一日电】路透社纽约二十九日电：出席联合国大会的国民党代表团，于二十九日晚发表声明称：他们“不同意白俄罗斯代表团二十八日在大会发表的意见说美军留驻中国，是违反联合国宪章。全世界都知道美军之在中国，是经中国同意，并负有解除在华日军武装，与遣送日军日侨返国之任务。随着这些任务，在中国各地的逐渐完成，美军业已减少与撤退，现在留驻中国的只是其中的少数。美军并没有参加政府军与共产党军队所发生的任何冲突，相反美国驻华代表曾以极大努力进行斡旋，使中国政治纠纷，和平解决，这是很令人感激的。”
