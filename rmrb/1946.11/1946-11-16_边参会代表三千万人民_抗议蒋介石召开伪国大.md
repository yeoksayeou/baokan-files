[Jinji-Luyu, 12th dispatch] The Border Area Assembly has issued a circular telegram protesting against Chiang Kai-shek's convocation of a false National Assembly, which states:

    Chiang Kai-shek, in violation of the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) jointly negotiated and unanimously approved by representatives of various parties and social figures, and risking the world's condemnation, has brazenly decided to convene his so-called "National Assembly" on November 12, which was designated by his party alone ten years ago. This proves that he has embraced the final determination to be anti-people, anti-democratic, and to be an enemy of the people. The PCC resolutions and its procedures, having been jointly decided upon by representatives of all parties and social figures across the country, should be regarded as a charter to be jointly observed by the people of the whole country. Therefore, all acts in violation of this charter are illegal crimes. Chiang Kai-shek's perverse actions, acting as a troublemaker, will inevitably be spurned and punished by the people of the whole country. The thirty million people of this border area vow to oppose this illegal and false National Assembly to the death, and prepare all our strength to fight to the end for the realization of the PCC resolutions!

    边参会代表三千万人民
    抗议蒋介石召开伪国大
    【晋冀鲁豫十二日电】边参会顷发表通电抗议蒋介石召开伪国民大会，内称：
    蒋介石违反各党派代表及社会贤达共同协商一致通过的政协决议，甘冒天下之大不韪，悍然决定于十一月十二日召开其十年前山一党包办圈定指定的所谓“国民大会”，证明他已抱定反人民反民主与人民为敌的最后决心。政协决议及其程序，既为全国各党派代表及社会贤达的共商决定，应即视为全国人民共同遵守之宪章，故凡一切违反此宪章的行为，均为非法罪行。蒋介石如此倒行逆施，甘为祸首，必遭全国人民的唾弃与惩罚。本边区三千万人民誓死反对此种非法的伪国民大会，并准备一切力量，为实现政协决议，奋斗到底！
