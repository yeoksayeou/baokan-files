　　Taiyue Administrative Office Loans 100 Million to Support Textile Industry
　　Taiyue Xinhua Daily Calls for Winter Textile Movement
　　[Our Taiyue Dispatch, 1st] This year, the Taiyue region planted 300,000 mu of cotton. Except for the northern Yue area, which suffered slight losses due to frost, the cotton-producing areas of southern Shanxi and northern Henan reported bumper harvests. The total cotton production in the region will reach nearly 10 million jin, enough to meet the needs of the three million soldiers and civilians in the entire region. In order to launch the winter textile movement, the Administrative Office has issued loans of 100 million yuan, specifying that two-thirds be used to solve the difficulty of textile tools. The widespread textile movement in the entire region will soon begin.
　　[Our Taiyue Dispatch, 31st] The Xinhua Daily here recently published an editorial calling for seizing the gaps in the war to launch the winter textile movement. The editorial first pointed out the importance of textile work, stating: According to materials from various regions, after the realization of "land to the tiller," each person averages about three mu of land. In good years, each mu can produce about 2.4 shi of refined grain. However, if each person needs an average of one bolt of cloth (3.3 zhang) per year, they need one shi of fine grain. If the problem of clothing is not solved by planting cotton and textiles, more than 40 percent of agricultural income will be spent, and it will not be possible to "cultivate three and have a surplus of one." The article then pointed out that in areas with a foundation in textiles, sideline income accounts for about half of agricultural income. If textile organizations continue to be developed and expanded, "cultivate three and have a surplus of one" can be achieved. Therefore, the editorial calls on areas with a foundation in textiles in southern Shanxi and northern Henan to use the gaps in the war to engage in textiles. The Baijin Line and mountainous areas did not have a foundation in textiles in the past. Although there has been development, among the 1.5 million people, there are only 150,000 female spinners, who can only weave one million bolts per year, which is not enough. Therefore, a large number of female spinners must be developed to strive for self-cultivation, self-spinning, self-weaving, and self-wearing.
　　[This Dispatch] Neiqiu Fourth District is close to the mountains and does not traditionally grow cotton. This year, the masses broke with old habits and planted more than 900 mu of cotton (accounting for 5 percent of the cultivated land), producing a total of 72,000 jin of seed cotton, which can yield more than 34,000 jin of net cotton. The district has 10,177 people, with an average of more than two jin of cotton per person, which is already self-sufficient. In terms of yield, one mu of cotton is equivalent to planting four mu of grain.

　　太岳行署贷款一万万扶助纺织
    太岳新华日报号召开展冬季纺织运动
    【本报太岳一日电】今年太岳全区植棉三十万亩，除岳北山地因霜灾略受损失外，晋南、豫北产棉区均告丰收，全区产棉将及一千万斤，足够全区三百万军民的需用。行署为展开今冬的纺织运动，顷特发放贷款一万万元，并指定以三分之二解决纺织工具的困难，普遍全区的纺织运动不久即将展开。
    【本报太岳三十一日电】此间新华日报顷发表社论，号召抓紧战争空隙，展开冬季纺织运动。该社论首先指出纺织工作的重要称：根据各地材料，实现耕者有其田后每人平均土地约三亩左右，好年景每年可产二石四斗细粮，但以每人每年最低限度平均需穿一匹布（三丈三尺）计算，即需细粮一石。如不植棉纺织解决穿衣问题，就需花去农业收入的百分之四十以上，就不能作到耕三余一。该文继即指出，在纺织有基础地区，副业收入约占农业收入的一半，如再继续发展扩大纺织组织，便可达到耕三余一。因之社论号召晋南、豫北纺织有基础的地区，要利用战争空隙进行纺织。白晋线及山地过去纺织没有基础，现虽有发展，但在这一百五十万人中只有十五万纺妇，每年只能纺织一百万匹，不够需用，故尚须大量发展纺妇，争取自种自纺自织自穿。
    【本报讯】内邱四区紧靠山地，素不种棉；今年群众打破旧习，种棉花九百余亩（占耕地面积百分之五），共产籽棉七万二千斤，可出净花三万四千多斤。全区一万零一百七十七口人，每人平均花二斤多，已可自给。在产量上说，一亩棉顶种四亩谷。
