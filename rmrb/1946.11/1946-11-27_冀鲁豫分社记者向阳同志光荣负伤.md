　　Correspondent Xiang Yang of the Hebei-Luyu Branch Severely Wounded

　　[Special dispatch from this newspaper] Comrade Xiang Yang (Zhang Xiangxuan), a frontline correspondent from the frontline reporter group of this newspaper and the Xinhua News Agency Hebei-Luyu Branch, was unfortunately wounded in his left arm and left leg by Chiang Kai-shek's army's artillery shell in the battle of Shangguan Village, southeast of Hua County, while accompanying the army to the Puyang-Hua County front for interviews. After Comrade Xiang Yang was wounded, the frontline medical personnel of the unit immediately bandaged him and found a stretcher, preparing to send him to a rear hospital for treatment immediately. However, Comrade Xiang Yang was deeply concerned that leaving the front line would affect the entire reporting work of this battle, so he continued to persevere in his work until he had explained the reporting work of the unit in detail and arranged it for the comrades in the propaganda and education department of the unit before leaving the front line to recuperate in the rear. After hearing the news, the frontline reporter group of this newspaper has sent a special person to the hospital to express condolences, and is determined to learn from the working spirit of Comrade Xiang Yang and step up future reporting on the self-defense war. Comrade Xiang Yang has been engaged in journalism for six years since 1941, and he is serious and responsible in his work. This unfortunate injury has caused all the comrades in this newspaper to increase their hatred for the enemy. In addition to writing letters of condolence, they are determined to comfort Comrade Xiang Yang with intense practical work. This newspaper also telegraphed the frontline reporter group to allocate 5,000 yuan for condolences. (Dongfang)
