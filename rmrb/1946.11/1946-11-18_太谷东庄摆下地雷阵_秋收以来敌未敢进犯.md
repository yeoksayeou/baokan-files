    Taigu Dongzhuang Sets Up a Minefield
    Enemy Has Not Dared to Invade Since Autumn Harvest
    [This newspaper, Taigu News] After the people's militia of Dongzhuang in this county victoriously defended the autumn harvest, they have become even more active. In addition to organizing mutual aid teams to help the masses rush to autumn plowing during the day, at night they divide the militia into three mine teams, placing mines in all strategic locations, including pressure mines, tripwire mines, bow mines, and booby-trap mines. On October 19th, over a hundred Kuomintang troops stationed in Houcheng attempted to loot grain in Dongzhuang Village. As soon as they entered the entrance of Dongzhuang, they stepped on two mines, wounding two people. Seeing the situation was not good, the enemy dared not advance and fled in disarray. They all said, "Dongzhuang entrance is full of mines, we dare not go there to loot grain." Therefore, since the autumn harvest, the enemy has not dared to go to Dongzhuang once. The masses of Dongzhuang had already finished harvesting and hiding their grain, and have not suffered a single loss.

    太谷东庄摆下地雷阵
    秋收以来敌未敢进犯
    【本报太谷讯】本县东庄民兵在保卫秋收胜利后，更形活跃，除组织互助组在白天帮助群众突击秋耕外，夜间把民兵分成三个地雷组，在各险要地带摆满地雷，有踏雷、拉雷、弓雷、拌雷等等。十月十九日驻侯城晋绥军百余人，企图到东庄村抢粮，一进入东庄口即踏响地雷两颗，炸伤二人。敌人见势不好，不敢前进，即狼狈溃窜。都说：“东庄口到处是地雷，咱们可不敢去抢粮。”所以自秋收以来，敌人没敢到过东庄一次，东庄群众把粮食早已打完藏好，没有受到一颗损失。
