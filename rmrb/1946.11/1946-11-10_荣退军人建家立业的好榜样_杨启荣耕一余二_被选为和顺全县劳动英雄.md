　　A Good Example of Retired Soldiers Building Homes and Establishing Careers
    Yang Qirong Cultivates One, Surplus Two
    Selected as a Labor Hero of Heshun County
    [Reported by this newspaper] Retired soldier Yang Qirong, who just settled down in Yaoyu Village, Heshun County this year, has already achieved cultivating one and having a surplus of two due to his diligent labor. Yang Qirong joined the Eighth Route Army in 1937 and retired in January this year. The village allocated him 1.8 mu of flat land, and he also reclaimed more than ten mu of wasteland and collected one hundred dan of manure. During the busy farming season, he went to the fields with corn buns and fried noodles, working from dawn till dusk. He often said to his neighbors, "I have been underfed and undernourished since I was a child, and later I worked as a temporary laborer for others. In the past, I wanted land but had none. Now that I have so much land to reclaim, how can I not work hard!?" As a result of a year's labor, he harvested ten small shi of millet, five small shi of corn, six small shi of beans, sixty bundles of white hemp, ninety bundles of yellow hemp, six small shi of hemp seeds; one hundred and ten melons, eighty heads of Chinese cabbage, fifteen dan of yams, three cloth bags of dried green beans, and one shi and six dou of buckwheat, enough for three years of consumption. He also plans to open a tofu shop in the winter using six shi of beans. The district awarded him a small sow, and he plans to raise another one. He was selected as one of the heroes at the county's labor hero conference. Everyone praised him as a good example of retired soldiers building homes and establishing careers.

    【本报讯】荣退军人杨启荣，今年才在和顺要峪村安家，因努力劳动，已做到耕一余二。杨启荣三七年参加八路军，今年一月退伍。村里分给他一亩八分平地，他又另外刨了十几亩荒地，拾了一百担粪。农忙时候，他带着窝窝头和炒面上地，早出晚归的赶活。他常和邻居们说：“我从小就是少吃无喝，后来给人家打短工，过去想‘受’没地，现在有这么多地给我刨，还不加劲干！？”一年劳动结果，他收了十小石谷子，五小石玉茭，六小石豆子，白麻六十捆，黄麻九十捆，麻籽六小石；瓜一百一十个，茴子白八十个，山药十五担，干豆角三布袋，荞麦一石六斗。足供三年食用。他还准备冬天以六石豆子，开个豆腐房。区上奖给他小母猪一口，他打算还喂一口。这次县上开劳英大会时，他被选为英雄之一。大家都称赞他是荣退军人建家立业的好榜样。
