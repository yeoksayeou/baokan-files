　　Launching Guerrilla Warfare in the Chiang Occupied Areas
    ——Speech by Comrade Pan Fusheng, Deputy Secretary of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan District Party Committee, at the Joint Meeting of County Party Secretaries in Yunxi County

　　(1) Make preparations for guerrilla warfare, overcome peaceful illusions, and recognize the nature of the war.

　　Based on the situation in Yuncheng and Juye counties, it is proven that guerrilla warfare can be carried out in the Chiang-occupied areas. The efforts of the three districts in Yuncheng have created a good example for us to carry out guerrilla warfare in the Chiang-occupied areas. Facts have proven that some of the retreated areas were not due to the strength of the enemy there, but due to right-leaning retreatist thinking in the leadership.

　　At the beginning of the war, our leadership and cadres believed that the enemy would not reach the hinterland. The assessment of the war and the enemy was insufficient. This complacency and underestimation of the enemy caused us to neglect timely and sufficient specific preparations for persisting in guerrilla warfare. Therefore, some areas were in temporary panic and chaos due to the lack of prior preparation. Although some areas paid attention to preparing for guerrilla warfare beforehand, they failed due to conflicts with war support work, which caused great losses to our persistence in guerrilla warfare.

　　The main reason for this problem is that cadres are unwilling to persist in guerrilla warfare. This thinking is because they cannot transition from peace to war. Many cadres have peaceful illusions, attempting to escape, and using various objective reasons to avoid persisting in guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines. We must patiently educate and earnestly persuade these politically corrupt individuals to quickly make this transition. As for individual elements who are politically corrupt beyond redemption, discipline should be enforced. We must clearly point out in the leadership and in the minds of the cadres that we must persist in guerrilla warfare, combat the activities of the reactionaries, and fight alongside the local masses for the protection of the people's interests until the final victory. If the leadership and the cadres clearly and positively affirm the above policy, then the cadres will plan to persist in guerrilla warfare.

　　Secondly, some cadres have errors in their understanding of the nature of the war. This war is a patriotic self-defense war of the Chinese people against the reactionary Sino-American forces. All those who are unwilling to be slaves and unwilling to be subjugated oppose Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary, traitorous civil war. However, some people mistakenly emphasize that it is a class war, and therefore feel that enemies are everywhere in the countryside. Some people say: "This time, fighting guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines is different from the eight years of guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines during the War of Resistance Against Japan, because we offended landlords and rich peasants when mobilizing the masses, and there are more enemies," so they dare not persist. This idea is completely untrue, because our implementation of land reform - realizing land to the tiller - is reasonable and legal, and we take care of the lives of landlords. However, Chiang Kai-shek's current traitorous civil war, wherever the Chiang army goes, all classes are subjected to rape, arson, killing, and looting, arousing the opposition of all classes. Therefore, it is possible for us to unite all those who oppose Chiang's civil war and national betrayal, and form an anti-Chiang united front of all classes in the countryside. This is as broad as the social foundation in the War of Resistance Against Japan, and there are conditions for complete victory in persisting in guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines.

　　(2) Organize armed work groups, holding a gun in one hand and carrying out work in the other.

　　In the future, we should further clarify our work policy, which is to develop armed forces, carry out guerrilla warfare, combat the activities of reactionaries (returning home defense corps, small armed forces, and armed special agents), and protect the interests of the masses. We must clearly and fully implement this in all our actions. We must lead the majority of the masses there to carry out mass guerrilla warfare. There, we must closely integrate our activities with the interests of the masses and clarify our policies. Only in this way can we more effectively launch guerrilla warfare, maintain the revolutionary order of New Democracy, and defeat the counter-revolutionary order.

　　In terms of armed forces, we must develop them in large numbers and strengthen the county and district armed forces to support mass guerrilla warfare. However, in development, we must pay attention to the composition, and the existing armed forces must also be rectified. "Individual unstable elements must be purged" so that these armed forces are firmly controlled. Armed forces operating behind enemy lines should pay special attention to the relationship between officers and soldiers to consolidate the troops, and pay attention to the relationship between the army and the people, strictly enforcing the discipline of the troops among the masses. All phenomena that violate the discipline of the masses should be strictly dealt with.

　　Secondly, it is necessary to rectify the militia organization. It is inappropriate to concentrate a large number of militia forces for mobile operations. Concentrating them in large numbers and using large-scale methods will lead to detachment from the masses, failure to exert greater effect, and even loss of combat effectiveness. Therefore, we should, under the principle of controlling firearms and not losing a single gun, call on a portion of the militia to voluntarily participate in the county and district armed forces. In addition, we should organize a portion of capable militia, led by cadres, to cooperate with local armed forces in guerrilla warfare, without requiring large numbers, to play the role of armed work teams. Other militia without firearms can be mobilized to return to their villages, given certain tasks, unite the masses of the whole village, protect the interests of the whole village, monitor bad elements, and exchange information and contacts.

　　Our sub-district cadres and district cadres can draw a portion to form armed work groups or armed work teams to go deep into the villages behind enemy lines to carry out work, support the masses, and carry out various tasks.

　　Politically, we must be very sensitive, put forward slogans, point out the direction for the masses, and expose the crimes and conspiracies of the enemy based on concrete facts so that the masses will not lose their way. Therefore, responsible comrades of the county and district governments must accompany the armed forces and armed work teams (or groups) to announce our policies and laws to the masses everywhere, expose the enemy's appeasement and deception, warn bad elements by writing letters, and solve the problems of the masses in a timely manner, rely on the masses, unite the majority, and jointly deal with the reactionaries. Call on mass organizations to resist Chiang and the puppet regime, restore their organizations, and lead members to persist in their work and protect the fruits of their liberation.

　　Economically, our focus of struggle should be on opposing aid to the enemy, telling the masses: "If you aid the enemy, you are fattening him, making him more powerful to kill you," and not letting the enemy grab a single grain of food.

　　In short, we must enhance the confidence of Party, government, and civilian cadres in persisting in guerrilla warfare, organize armed work groups, holding a gun in one hand and carrying out various tasks in the other. When fighting, it is a combat squad, and usually it is a work team, entering the village to carry out various tasks separately. This organizational form is very suitable for the current needs of work in the Chiang-occupied areas.

　　(3) Clarify the concept of the masses, implement land reform, and unite the majority.

　　To expand and improve guerrilla warfare in the Chiang-occupied areas and make it mass-based, it is also necessary to deeply lead the implementation of land reform and master various policies. In leadership, we must carry out self-criticism from top to bottom, reflect on the ideological roots of our separation from the masses, clarify the concept of the masses, clarify the methods of following the mass line, and resolutely correct the tendency of bureaucracy and separation from the masses. When entering villages, we must admit our mistakes to the masses, solicit their opinions on us, and apologize and compensate the masses. It is necessary to mobilize village cadres to reflect and examine themselves in order to improve relations with the masses. And hold a united anti-Chiang meeting in the whole village, everyone mutually pledging not to reveal the situation in the village, and everyone protecting the interests of the village with one heart. If there are saboteurs, they will inevitably be punished.

　　In terms of land reform, due to our insufficient subjective efforts, coupled with the impact of the war, it was generally not thorough, and some fruits were not well distributed. This cannot but be a major loss for carrying out mass guerrilla warfare today. Today we should implement it. As long as we can reach the areas and villages, we will immediately seize the land issue. If the land issue is not resolved thoroughly, make it thorough, if the fruits are not distributed, distribute them, and if the distribution is unreasonable, correct it. Every comrade must clearly understand the basic issue of solving the land problem of the masses and carrying out mass guerrilla warfare, and we must resolutely implement it. Some comrades believe that the masses in the Chiang-occupied areas do not dare to ask for land. Facts in various places prove that this is not the case. As long as we can go deep behind enemy lines to carry out guerrilla warfare, support the masses, and combat the activities of bad elements, the peasants will dare to ask for land, and the masses will inevitably resolutely and actively rise up to protect their land.

　　In terms of policy, we must grasp the principle of "uniting the majority and unanimously opposing Chiang." Under this principle, we must resolutely suppress armed returning home defense corps and armed special agents. We should unite and guarantee all anti-Chiang and law-abiding landlords, but for individual landlords who collude with the enemy, destroy us, rob the fruits of the masses, and damage the interests of the masses, we should warn them to correct their mistakes to show leniency, otherwise we will resolutely strike them.

### 开展蒋占区游击战争——冀鲁豫区党委副书记潘复生同志在运西县书联席会上的发言

　　开展蒋占区游击战争
    ——冀鲁豫区党委副书记潘复生同志在运西县书联席会上的发言
    （一）作好游击战准备工作，克服和平幻想，认清战争性质。
    根据郓城、巨野两县的情况，证明在蒋占区是能够开展游击战争的。郓城某某三个区的努力，更给我们创造了在蒋占区开展游击战争的好榜样。事实证明，某些退出的地区，不是因为那里敌人厉害，而是由于领导上的右倾退却思想所致。
    在战争开始时，我们领导上及干部思想上，认为敌人不会打到腹地，对战争的估计，对敌人的估计是不足的，这种麻痹、轻敌的观点，使我们忽视了及时充分作坚持游击战争的具体准备工作。所以有些地区由于事前无准备，而临时张惶混乱。有些地区事前虽注意了准备游击战争的工作，但又因与战勤工作的矛盾而落空，这给我们坚持游击战争以很大的损失。
    产生这种毛病的主要原因，是由于干部思想上不愿坚持游击战，这种思想是由于从和平到战争的这个蛮子没法转过来。许多干部存在和平幻想，企图幸免，借口各种客观原因，不在敌后坚持游击战争。对这种政治上腐化的人，我们必须进行耐心的教育，苦口婆心的说服，把这个弯子很快的转过来。至于个别的政治上腐化到不可救药的分子，则应执行纪律，我们要在领导上、干部思想上，明确的指出一定要坚持游击战，打击反动派的活动、为保卫人民利益而与当地群众同生死共患难，奋斗到最后胜利。如果领导思想上和干部思想上明确与肯定了以上的方针，则干部即会作坚持游击战争的打算。
    其次是有些干部对战争性质的认识上有错误。此次战争是中国人民反对中美反动派的爱国自卫战争，一切不愿做奴隶牛马、不愿当亡国奴的人，都反对蒋介石这一反动的卖国内战。然而，有些人却错误的强调是阶级战争，因而觉得在农村到处是敌人。有人说：“这回在敌后打游击和抗战八年的敌后游击不同，因为在发动群众时得罪了地主、富农，仇人多了”，所以不敢坚持。这种想法完全不是事实，因为我们执行土地改革——实现耕者有其田，是合理合法的，我们对地主的生活是照顾的；而蒋介石今天所进行的卖国内战，凡蒋军所到之地，一切阶层均遭奸淫、烧杀、抢掠，引起各阶层的反对。所以，我们团结一切反蒋内战卖国的人，形成农村各阶层的反蒋统一战线，是可能的，这与在抗战中的社会基础同样是广泛的，坚持敌后游击战争是有完全胜利的条件的。
    （二）组织武装工作组，一手拿枪，一手进行工作。
    今后应更明确我们的工作方针，是发展武装，开展游击战争，打击反动派（还乡团、小股武装和武装特务）的活动，保卫群众利益。我们必须十分明确的把它贯注到一切行动中去。我们要把那里的多数群众带领起来，开展群众性的游击战争，那里必须把我们的活动与群众利益密切的结合起来，明确我们的政策，这样，才能更有力的展开游击战，保持新民主主义的革命秩序，打垮反革命的秩序。
    在武装上，我们要大量发展，把县区武装壮大起来，支持群众性的游击战。但在发展中，必须注意成分，现有武装也要进行整顿，“个别的不稳分子要清洗”，使这些武装确切的掌握起来。在敌后活动的武装，应特别注意官兵关系，以巩固部队；注意军民关系，严格部队群众纪律，一切违犯群众纪律的现象，均应严格处理。
    其次，是要整顿民兵组织，民兵大批集中机动是不妥当的，大批集中起来，用大拉的方式，就会脱离群众，不能发挥其更大作用，甚至失掉战斗力。所以，我们应在掌握枪枝、不丢掉一枝枪的原则下，号召一部分民兵自动自愿的参加县区武装；另外组织一部分精干的民兵，由干部带领，配合地方武装打游击，在量上不必多，使之起武工队的作用。其他民兵不带枪枝的，可动员回本村，给他一定任务，团结全村群众，保卫全村利益，监视坏分子，并互通情报及联系。
    我们的小区干部及区干，可抽一部分组成武工组或武工队，深入敌后各村进行工作，给群众撑腰，并进行各种工作。
    在政治上，我们要很敏锐，按着提出口号，给群众指出方向，根据具体果实揭露敌人的罪行及阴谋，使群众不致失迷方向。因此，必须县、区政府负责同志随武装及武工队（或组），到处向群众宣布我们的政策、法令、揭破敌人的怀柔欺骗，用写信等方式警告坏分子，并及时解决群众问题，依靠群众、团结多数，共同对付反动派。号召群众团体反抗蒋伪，恢复组织，领导会员坚持工作，保卫翻身果实。
    在经济上，我们的斗争重点应该是反资敌，告诉群众：“如果资敌，就是把敌人养肥，使他更有力来杀害自己”，不让敌人抢一粒粮食。
    总之，我们要把党政民干部坚持游击战的信心提高，组织武装工作组，一手拿枪，一手进行各种工作，打起仗来它是战斗班，平常则是工作队，进村分头进行各种工作。这一组织形式是很适合当前蒋占区工作需要的。
    （三）明确群众观念，贯彻土地改革，团结多数。
    蒋占区游击战斗的展开提高，并使之成为群众性的，还必须深入领导贯彻土地改革和掌握各种政策。在领导上，我们要自上而下的开展自我批评，反省自己脱离群众的思想根源，明确群众观念，明确走群众路线的方法，切实纠正官僚主义和脱离群众的倾向；并在进入村庄的时候，向群众承认错误，征询群众对我们的意见，向群众道歉赔偿。要动员村干部反省检讨，以求改善与群众的关系。并在全村开团结反蒋会，大家互相誓约不泄露本村情况，大家一条心的保卫本村利益。如有破坏者则必然遭到处罚。
    在土地改革方面，由于我们主观努力不够，加之战争影响，一般的没有做到彻底，有的果实没有很好分配，这不能不是今天开展群众性游击战争的一大损失。今天我们应当贯彻下去，只要我们能够到达的地区及村庄，我们即刻抓紧解决土地问题，土地问题解决的不彻底的使它彻底，果实没有分配就分配，分配的不合理则纠正。每个同志必须明确解决群众的土地问题，开展群众性游击战争的基本问题，我们必须坚决贯彻。有的同志认为在蒋占区群众不敢要土地，各地事实证明不是这样，只要我们能深入敌后开展游击战争，给群众撑腰，打击坏分子的活动，则农民是敢于要土地的，群众也必然坚决积极的起来保卫自己的土地。
    在政策方面，一定要掌握“团结多数，一致反蒋”的原则。在这个原则下，我们对武装还乡团、武装特务要坚决镇压；对一切反蒋及安分守己的地主，则应团结并给以保证；但对个别的勾结敌人，对我破坏、抢掠群众果实，破坏群众利益者，我们应当警告其改正，以示宽大，不然则坚决打击之。
