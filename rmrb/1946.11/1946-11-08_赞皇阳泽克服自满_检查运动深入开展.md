　　Zanhhuang Yangze Overcomes Complacency
    Inspection Movement Deeply Developed
    [Our newspaper, Zanhhuang News] Yangze Village in this county has begun a large-scale inspection movement to overturn the old order, and has overcome the cadres' "good enough" mentality. At the beginning of the inspection, individual cadres and activists thought that the land and houses had already been distributed, and the movement to overturn the old order was "good enough." Due to complacency, they were not enthusiastic about the inspection movement and were sluggish in their work. After the review, there was slight improvement. However, as the movement unfolded and deepened, it was discovered that the poorest and most backward peasants in the village had not achieved a complete liberation because of their "conscience and sentiment" thought of being afraid of offending people. As a result, the cadres thoroughly broke their complacency and "good enough" mentality, enabling the movement to develop in depth. In addition, Yuantou Village also discovered during the inspection movement that the local despots and landlords were using various methods to conceal their occupied land and divert the target of mass struggle. Because the struggle against the local despots was not thorough enough, the masses failed to completely overturn the old order. After discovering the problem, the village is now conducting a liquidation based on the actual situation.

　　赞皇阳泽克服自满
    检查运动深入开展
    【本报赞皇讯】本县阳泽村已开始翻身大检查运动，并克服了干部的“差不多”思想。开始检查之初，个别干部及积极分子以为地和房子都已经分了，翻身运动就“差不多”了，由于自满而对检查运动不起劲，对工作则疲塌，后在检讨中稍有改进。但当运动展开，深入检查后，发现村中最穷苦的落后农民，因为存在着怕得罪人的“良心、情面”思想，而没有达到翻身。由此，干部才彻底打破自满情绪和“差不多”思想，使运动得到深入展开。另外，院头村在检查运动中，也发现了恶霸地主在用各种方式掩盖其霸占土地，转移群众斗争目标，因为对恶霸斗争不彻底，而使群众未能翻透身。该村发现问题后，正在根据实际情形，进行清算中。
