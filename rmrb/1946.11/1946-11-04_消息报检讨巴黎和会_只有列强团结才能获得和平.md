　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st. TASS reports: The international commentator for "Izvestia" recently authored an article stating: One of the main lessons of the Paris Peace Conference is that it confirms the Soviet view on the role of the victorious great powers in organizing peace, namely, that the main responsibility for organizing peace lies with the major powers. This irrefutable truth is now being recognized even by those who, not long ago, under the guise of defending the interests of small countries, were opposing the agreements of the Council of Foreign Ministers. If the Paris Peace Conference failed to reach unanimous decisions on the clauses of the peace treaties that had not been unanimously agreed upon after the Council of Foreign Ministers, then every effort should be made at the next New York Council of Foreign Ministers to reach unanimous decisions on these clauses by acknowledging mutual interests. An indispensable condition for achieving this is to eliminate the theory of dividing the world into eastern and western halves, to abandon attempts to impose one's own will on other countries, to respect the independent path of small countries in post-war development, and to strive for the interests of universal peace and security. "Izvestia" pointed out: To organize a democratic peace is only possible in the struggle against those who crave "dollar diplomacy" and try to treat the whole world as their own inheritance. This struggle is not easy, but difficulties do not confuse or discourage the people who support a democratic peace. The example of this struggle has been created by the Soviet delegation at the Paris Peace Conference. On the eve of this New York Council of Foreign Ministers (scheduled to open on November 4), the ghost of "dollar diplomacy" is still trying to poison relations between large and small countries, hiding their true intentions and disguising them with seemingly noble slogans, such as defending democracy, safeguarding the interests of small countries, and caring about the restoration of the collapsed economies of post-war European countries; in reality, they are continuing their policy of economic or political oppression, imposing their own will on countries that refuse to be the tail of their imperialist interests.

### 消息报检讨巴黎和会  只有列强团结才能获得和平

　　消息报检讨巴黎和会
    只有列强团结才能获得和平
    【新华社延安一日电】塔斯社讯：消息报国际评论家顷著文称：巴黎和会的主要教训之一，乃是它证实苏联方面关于胜利国列强在组织和平中作用的观点，即组织和平的主要责任是在大强国身上。这个颠扑不破的真理现在甚至连那些在保卫小国权益的掩饰下不久以前还在反对外长会议协议的人们也不得不承认了。如果在巴黎和会上关于外长会议后尚未一致协议的和约条款未能达到一致决定的话，那就应在下届纽约的长外会议上竭一切努力，以承认互相的利益去达到这些条文的一致决定。要做到这一点，有一个不可或缺的条件，那就是要排除把世界分成东西两半的理论，要放弃把自己意志强施于他国的企图，要尊重小国在战后发展独立的道路，而且要力求普遍和平安全的利益。消息报指出：要组织民主的和平，只有在反对那些渴望“金元政策”和试图把全世界当作他们自己的遗产一般的人们的斗争中才有可能。这个斗争并不容易，但困难并不使拥护民主和平的人民迷乱和丧气。这种斗争的范例，已由苏联代表团在巴黎和平会议上创造出来。在此纽约外长会议（定于十一月四日开幕）的前夕，“金元外交”的游魂仍在试图毒害大小国家间的关系，他们把他们真正的意见隐藏起来，以看起来似乎高尚的口号作为伪装，说什么保卫民主啦，卫护小国利益啦，关心战后欧洲各国崩溃的经济之恢复啦；实际上则继续着他们在经济上或政治上压迫的政策，把他们自己的意志强施于拒绝当他们帝国主义利益尾巴的国家身上的政策。
