Cultivate the Habit of Learning
    Xi Yi
    We are reprinting this article about learning, hoping to make it a start, so that everyone can send in a continuous stream of learning insights, opinions on improving learning, and learning experiences in the future. In particular, we welcome insights on studying "On the Current Situation." - Editor
    Chairman Mao earnestly admonished us in "On the New Stage" that "To guide a great revolutionary movement to victory, one cannot have victory without revolutionary theory, without historical knowledge, and without understanding of the actual movement." This is a clear explanation of the important relationship between learning and revolution. Then, Chairman Mao called on us to "see who really learns something, who learns more, and who learns better." When we are now studying the Party Constitution, the Party Constitution clearly stipulates that "striving to improve one's own level of awareness and understanding the foundations of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought" is a regular duty of every comrade. However, to this day, many of our comrades still do not have the habit of regular learning. They only study when the organization stipulates studying certain documents, and then put it aside, showing a very infrequent phenomenon, so they learn very little and learn poorly. Their work cannot be done better, just busy, doing things as usual, and after a few years of "busy work," the work does not improve, and confidence decreases, so they are uneasy about their work and ask for a transfer. This should attract our attention and needs to be studied.
    Why don't some comrades develop the habit of learning? (1) Some comrades think they are too old to learn; some comrades think that they have been making revolution for so many years without learning, and they have also completed their work tasks, "why bother with chopsticks to drink boiled water"; some comrades think that they are too busy with work, their minds are in a mess, and they don't have time to study; some comrades think that they are already great and don't need to learn anything. Under this excuse, they give up learning. (2) Some comrades think that sitting in the cave and flipping through books makes them more and more confused, or that the things in books are dogmatic, and only in actual work can they learn real theory, so they wholeheartedly yearn for "practice" and give up learning. (3) Some comrades, upon hearing that they have to study Marxist-Leninist theory, Mao Zedong Thought, Chinese history, and the current actual movement, feel like "a tiger eating the sky has no way to start" and cannot find a way; or they are scared by seeing so much to learn. (4) Some leaders do not take leading learning as their regular business. When they inspect, they only check the quality of work, so the cadres below are willing to learn or not, and no one cares anyway.
    So how can we develop the habit of learning? Indeed, it is not easy to learn and make it a habit, and it is impossible to achieve it overnight, because learning must sit firmly, must rack your brains, and have the spirit of "perseverance," not "gazing at flowers from horseback." Therefore, first of all, we must establish the idea of learning, recognize the importance of learning in thought, and recognize that the quality of learning is closely related to work. If you are older, your brain may be a little duller, but you have rich experience, and your understanding is much stronger than that of young people. It is even more wrong to think that you can still make revolution without learning. Are we willing to be bureaucratic practitioners without political vision? If you are busy with work and have no time, but at a time when everyone is equally stressed, if you don't squeeze out some time to study in the midst of busyness, then the days will pass in a mess, and after a long time, it will be boring, the mood will be low, and work will become sluggish. Self-satisfaction and arrogance are obviously wrong.
    Secondly, we must have the correct method of combining with practice and with our own thoughts and work. This principle has been said many times in the past, so there is no need to elaborate here.
    Thirdly, I think that the leadership should take leading cadres' learning as their regular business, "taking education and learning as part of their work!" We must adhere to the prescribed learning time, and distinguish the political and theoretical level of the cadres under our leadership. Conduct specific guidance and assistance; when inspecting, we should not only understand the work of the cadres, but also understand their learning. When appraising cadres, the learning situation should be used as one of the appraisal criteria.

### 养成学习的习惯

　　养成学习的习惯
    洗依
    我们转载了这篇谈学习的文章，是希望把这作为一个开头，以后大家能把学习心得、对改进学习的意见、学习经验等源源不绝地寄来。特别是目前对《论战局》学习的心得，尤为我们所欢迎。    编者
    毛主席在论新阶段中谆谆的诫诚我们“指导一个伟大的革命运动使之向着胜利，没有革命理论，没有历史知识，没有实际运动的了解，就不能有胜利。”这是再清楚不过的说明了学习与革命的重大的关系，接着毛主席就号召我们“看谁真正学到了一点东西，看谁学得更多一点，更好一点。”当我们现在学习党章的时候，在党章上又明确规定，“努力地提高自己的觉悟程度和领会马克思列宁主义，毛主席思想的基础”是我们每个同志的经常义务。但时至今日，我们的不少同志，仍然没有经常学习的习惯。他们只是在组织上规定学习某些文件时，学习一下，过后又置之度外，表现出一种极不经常的现象，也就学得很少，学得不好。他们的工作也就无法做得更好一些，忙忙碌碌，照例办事而已，而在几年“忙碌”之后，工作没有提高，信心随之降低，于是工作不安，要求调动，这就应当引起我们的注意，须要研究一下。
    究竟那些同志为什么没有养成学习习惯呢？（一）有的同志认为自己年纪大了，学不进去；有的同志认为没有学习也革了这多年的命，同样的也完成了工作任务，“喝开水用筷子，何必多此一举”；有的同志认为工作忙的不开交，脑子乱哄哄，没有时间学习；有的同志认为自己已经了不起，无须乎再学什么。在这个借口下，就放弃了学习。（二）有的同志认为坐在窑洞里翻书本，越翻越糊涂，或则说书本上的东西都是教条，只有到实际工作中才能学到真正的理论，于是一心向往“实际”而放弃了学习。（三）有的同志则一听说要学习马列主义的理论，毛泽东的思想，又要学中国的历史，还要学什么当前的实际运动，“老虎吃天没法下抓”，找不出个门路来；或者是看到要学这样多的东西，就被吓倒了。（四）某些领导上没有把领导学习作为自己经常的业务，他们在检查时，只检查工作好坏，所以下边的干部就愿学则学，不学亦可，反正没人管。
    那么如何才能把学习养成习惯呢？确实，进行学习且成为习惯，并非易事，一蹴即成是不可能的，因为学习必须坐稳屁股，必须绞些脑汁，要有“锲而不舍”的精神，不是“走马看花”，因而，首先要确立学习思想，在思想上认识到学习的重要，认识到学习的好坏与工作有极密切的关系。年纪大了，脑子也许迟钝一些，但是有丰富的经验，理解力要比青年们强得多。没有学习仍然可以革命，这种想法更不对，难道我们甘心作一个无政治远见的事务主义者吗？工作忙没时间，但在现在大家都同样紧张的时候，要是不在忙中挤出些时间来学习，那就会乱哄哄的一天天过去，时间久了，索然寡味，情绪低落，工作疲塌就都来了。自满自足，骄气十足，其错误是很明显的。
    其次，要有同实际结合、同自己的思想工作结合的正确方法，这道理在过去已经有人说过许多，这里不必细说。
    其次，我以为在领导上要把领导干部学习作为自己的经常业务，“把教育与学习当做工作的一部分！”要坚持规定的学习时间，要区别所领导的干部的政治理论水平。进行具体指导帮助；在检查时不仅了解干部的工作，也要了解他的学习，在鉴定干部的时候，学习情况如何应作为鉴定标准之一。
