　　Shanghai Rickshaw Pullers Defend Themselves
    Carrying Iron Hammers
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 5th: According to the Shanghai Xinmin Evening News on October 23rd, after a U.S. military personnel stationed in Shanghai violently beat Zang Da'erzi to death, rickshaw pullers in the city, in order to protect their lives, are mostly carrying iron hammers. If they encounter U.S. military personnel acting violently, they are prepared to defend themselves. On the evening of the 22nd, a pedicab driver pulled a U.S. sailor to a certain bar on Linsen Road. The U.S. soldier not only refused to pay the full fare but also tried to use force. For self-defense, the pedicab driver pulled out an iron hammer from behind the seat cushion and said to the U.S. soldier, "Come on! I'll beat you to death!" The U.S. soldier just bared his teeth and brandished his claws, but ultimately did not dare to strike. Many people watched on the road, and the sailor took the opportunity to slip into the bar.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 5th: Shanghai News: In the case of Zang Da'erzi, a rickshaw puller who was violently beaten to death by U.S. military personnel, donations from all walks of life are increasing daily. The United Evening News alone had received more than 7.8 million yuan in donations by the 22nd of last month.
