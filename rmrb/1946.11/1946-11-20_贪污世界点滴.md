	Glimpses of Corruption Around the World
	In Guangdong, a certain county magistrate, attending a provincial administrative meeting, not only brought several proposals but also a wife, a concubine, a son, a daughter, two nurses, and a wolfhound, incurring daily expenses exceeding 150,000 [currency not specified]. It is said he brought with him travel expenses of 10 million [currency not specified] and six taels of gold.
	In Guizhou, a certain county magistrate, on his first day in office, gathered all eighteen township chiefs in the county for a lecture, saying: "The county administration is like a bed. I, the county magistrate, sleep on the bed, and I want to sleep comfortably. If you mess around, I will treat you like eighteen bedbugs and catch you with the lights on." The township chiefs retreated in silence.
	Recently, newspapers in Kunming published a dispatch from Jianchuan, stating: County Magistrate Zhang Kaiqiong accepted bribes of 4 million [currency not specified] and condoned bandits' robberies, obtaining funds of over 30 million [currency not specified]. Upon seeing this dispatch, the county magistrate was enraged and, on the 4th, issued a public notice in the name of the county government, offering a reward of 100,000 [currency not specified] for the arrest of the reporter who wrote the dispatch.
	In Fujian Province, a debate within the Provincial Assembly over the fish market escalated into chaos. One assembly member shouted: "Everyone has secrets; the more we talk, the worse it gets..." Those who heard him were speechless.
	Teachers at National Schools in Beiping demanded back wages from the Municipal Education Bureau for the months following March of this year. The Education Bureau Chief replied in writing: "The mayor has changed; I have no time for this," and so on.
	In Yunhe County, Zhejiang Province, Li Zhan, an accountant in the County Government's Land and Grain Department, published an article in the newspaper entitled "What is Public Opinion," which involved the County Assembly. Thereupon, the chairman and vice-chairman of the Assembly, wielding pistols, stormed into Li's home, leaving it in a shambles.
