Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th: Nanjing dispatch: At the end of last month, the Shanghai Magazine Circles Association sent a memorandum to the representatives of the Third Party Political Consultative Conference, requesting them to forward it to the Chiang government, accusing the Kuomintang authorities of planning and implementing violence to destroy freedom of speech and publication in Shanghai, Ping, Chongqing, Kunming, and other places since May. The memorandum demands that the Chiang government immediately abolish the registration and licensing system, recognize already published legal newspapers and periodicals, declare all past banning orders invalid, and strictly restrain local governments from obstructing the circulation of publications. The memorandum points out that whether the Chiang government accepts the above demands is a fundamental test of its sincerity in implementing democratic politics.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th: Shanghai dispatch: The "Democracy Weekly," edited by Mr. Zheng Zhenduo here, has been repeatedly persecuted by the Kuomintang authorities and was finally forced to cease publication at the beginning of this month. The last issue of the journal, published at the end of the month, features a "Special Issue of Our Protest," written by Zheng, Ye Shengtao, Ma Xulun, Tian Han, and others, to lodge a serious protest against the Chiang government's insane destruction of freedom of speech and publication. The journal was founded in Shanghai on October 13th last year and registered and approved by the Kuomintang Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau and the Ministry of the Interior at the beginning of publication, and obtained a registration certificate, making it a completely legal publication. However, because the journal has always spoken for the people, it was hated by the Chiang government. In recent months, it has been repeatedly "searched and investigated." More than 3,000 copies of the 50th issue of the journal were completely confiscated. The police station repeatedly secretly ordered a ban on investigation and ordered the Shanghai Newspaper Association to inform newspaper vendors not to sell the journal. Despite repeated protests, the journal was eventually forced to cease publication.

    京沪杂志界提备忘录
    控诉当局摧残言论
    民主周刊被迫停刊
    【新华社延安十日电】南京讯：上月底沪杂志界联谊会，以备忘录一份送达第三方面政协代表，请其转送蒋政府，控诉国民党当局。自五月以来，在沪、平、渝、昆等地有计划的摧残言论出版之暴行，要求蒋政府立即废止登记特许制度，承认已出版的合法报刊，将过去所有查禁令宣布无效，及严格约束各地方政府，不得对出版物之流通，横加阻挠。备忘录指出蒋政府是否接受上述要求，是其有无诚意实行民主政治之基本考验。
    【新华社延安十日电】沪讯：此间郑振铎氏主编之“民主”周刊被国民党当局屡次迫害，终于月初被迫停刊。该刊月底出版的最后一期，发表郑氏及叶圣陶、马叙伦、田汉诸氏执笔之“我们的抗议特辑”，对蒋政府疯狂摧残言论出版之暴行，提出严重抗议。按该刊系去年十月十三日在沪创刊，出版之初，即向国民党沪社会局及内政部登记核准，并领有登记证，乃一完全合法之刊物，但该刊以素来代表人民发言，早遭蒋政府妒恨，数月来屡被“抄查”，该刊第五十期出版时三千余份，竟全部没收，警局更一再密命禁查，并饬令沪报业公会转知各报摊，不许售卖该刊，虽迭次抗议，但结果仍被迫停刊。
