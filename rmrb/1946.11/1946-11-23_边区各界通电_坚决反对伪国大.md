Border Region Circles Cable
    Resolutely Oppose the Pseudo-National Assembly
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] Chiang Kai-shek brazenly convened a one-party-controlled National Assembly, declaring war on the people of the entire country. People from all walks of life in the border region were extremely indignant upon hearing this news. The offices of the Taihang, Taiyue, Jinnan, and Ji-Lu-Yu regional councils and the general associations of workers, peasants, youth, and women for national salvation have successively issued cables, expressing their "resolute opposition to the pseudo-National Assembly and its fabricated constitution," and suggesting that the Preparatory Committee of the People's Representative Conference of the Yan'an Liberated Area should promptly convene the People's Representative Conference of the Liberated Area. They also call on compatriots in all liberated areas and democratic人士 throughout the country to join hands, pool their wisdom and efforts, and strive for the complete realization of national independence, peace, and democracy!
