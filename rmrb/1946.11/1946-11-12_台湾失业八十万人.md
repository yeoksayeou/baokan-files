    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 8th. According to Xie Chengyuan, the Taiwan representative attending the National Federation of Industry and Commerce, the number of unemployed people in Taiwan has reached 600,000 to 800,000, accounting for one-tenth to one-eighth of the province's total population of over 6 million. Although this year's grain harvest is good, people are still dying of starvation every day, a phenomenon that did not exist during the Japanese rule.
