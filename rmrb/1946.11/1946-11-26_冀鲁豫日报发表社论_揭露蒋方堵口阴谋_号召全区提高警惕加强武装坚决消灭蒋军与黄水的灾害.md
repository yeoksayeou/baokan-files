　　[Jilu Yu News] The Jilu Yu Daily published an editorial entitled "Resolutely Eliminate the Disaster of Chiang's Troops and the Yellow River," which stated in brief:

　　Regarding the Yellow River issue, our side and the Kuomintang had three agreements, but the Kuomintang harbored evil intentions and consistently broke faith, failing to comply with each agreement. They consistently adopted an "evasive" attitude towards the labor, food, funds, and materials required for dike restoration, hazard area management, and river straightening, only allocating a very small portion. They did not issue a single penny for the relocation expenses of residents in the riverbed. Their purpose was clear: the Kuomintang never forgot to use the Yellow River to divide our region and submerge the vast population of our region, in order to realize their conspiracy to destroy the liberated areas. Although the Kuomintang also sent people to discuss the Yellow River issue with us, and signed agreements, and allocated a small amount of labor funds and flour, which was far from what was needed for the restoration project, it was only to deceive the people of the world.

　　In recent months, the Kuomintang reactionaries and traitor Chiang Kai-shek, relying on the assistance of American imperialism, have been waging a full-scale civil war, launching large-scale offensives against various liberated areas. Their poisonous plan to use the Yellow River to create a major disaster in our region has become increasingly apparent. Not only did they fail to provide the labor and food funds that we advanced for the first phase of the dike restoration project, and failed to reissue the materials necessary for the dike restoration project, but they also consistently failed to repair the dikes in the Kuomintang-occupied areas upstream. To this day, they have not paid a single penny for the necessary hazard area engineering work in our region and the relocation expenses of residents in the riverbed; moreover, they have militarily invaded and occupied our region, and wantonly looted and destroyed our original materials and equipment for river management, causing huge losses to our labor, food, hemp ropes, straw, wooden stakes, cars, gasoline, etc., and strafed our river management agencies and dike repair workers with airplanes, forcing us to be unable to carry out restoration work. On the other hand, under these circumstances, they have tried their best to unilaterally block the breach in violation of the agreement. At present, the water surface of the breach is rapidly shrinking, and a diversion canal has been excavated. The Kuomintang sent senior officials to Huayuankou to supervise the work, intending to block the breach and release the water in the near future or before the end of the lunar year. The Kuomintang's vicious conspiracy is now undeniable.

　　The soldiers and civilians of our entire region must make resolute and tenacious struggles against all the Kuomintang's conspiracies. In addition to protesting the Kuomintang's breach of contract, and appealing to all righteous people in the country to jointly stop the Kuomintang's unilateral blocking of the breach in the short term, we must also call on and organize the masses of the entire region to carry out the following tasks while carrying out the self-defense war with all our strength: (1) The unrepaired dikes and certain hazard areas that need to be built must be built as soon as possible, and preparations for emergency rescue should be made where there is a possibility of danger. (2) Residents in the riverbed should start relocating immediately, and at least try to use kinship to transport food and bulky items out and store them first. (3) Immediately collect, repair, and build boats, and the government should immediately provide loans and subsidies. And there must be special personnel to organize boatmen and sailors, or establish boatmen's unions, to strengthen education so that they can better serve the ferry and emergency needs. (4) Establish Yellow River watch and liaison, or communication-like organizations, to report the blocking situation and water flow trends up and down, so as to avoid sudden flooding. (5) The soldiers and civilians of the entire region should become more determined and tense, completely smash Chiang Kai-shek's entire poisonous plan, actively join the army and participate in the war, and establish people's armed forces. And resolutely implement and complete the main tasks that adapt to the current situation in various places (such as launching guerrilla warfare, and eliminating secret agents, etc.), to cooperate with our regular corps to repel and eliminate the main force of Chiang's army sooner. One is to ensure that we control the dikes so that we can fully carry out the restoration work; the other is that only by completely defeating Chiang's army can we avoid any harm.

　　In the past few months, our party, government, army, and civilians throughout the region have made great achievements in carrying out the self-defense war and the struggle against the Yellow River issue. This fully shows that we have the strength to overcome all difficulties. The next few months will be extremely tense. As long as the party, government, army, and civilians of the entire region carry out various arduous struggles more resolutely and consistently, then the deep pain and heavy damage we have suffered in this struggle will surely be settled with the fascist dictator and traitor Chiang Kai-shek one by one in the near future.

　　冀鲁豫日报发表社论
    揭露蒋方堵口阴谋
    号召全区提高警惕加强武装坚决消灭蒋军与黄水的灾害
    【本报冀鲁豫讯】冀鲁豫日报以“坚决消灭蒋军与黄水灾害”为题发表社论略称：
    关于黄河问题，我方与国民党曾有过三次协议，而国民党包藏祸心，一贯失信，对于每次协议均未遵照履行。对复堤、整理险工、裁湾取直所需之工粮、工款、器材等，始终采取“应付”态度，只拨付极小一部。对河床居民之迁移费，则分文未发。其目的至显，即国民党从未忘怀利用黄水，来分割我区，和淹没我区广大人民，以冀实现其摧毁解放区之阴谋。国民党对于黄河问题，虽亦曾派人与我们商谈，并订协议，亦曾拨付与修复工程所需相差甚巨的一点工款与面粉等，则是欲借此一手遮盖天下人耳目而已。
    近几月来，国民党反动派卖国贼蒋介石，依赖美国帝国主义的援助，进行全面内战，大举向各解放区进攻。其欲利用黄水造成我区重大灾难之毒计也就随着益形显著。他们不但对于第一期复堤工程由我们垫发的工粮工款不给，对复堤工程必需的器材不予补发，在上游国民党占领区内之堤岸，仍始终不修，在我区之险工工程所需及河床内居民迁移费迄今一文未付；而且以军事进攻侵占我区，对我治河原有物资器材横加抢劫破坏，致我工粮、麻绳、秸料、木桩、汽车、汽油等等遭受巨大损失，并对我治河机关及修堤员工以飞机扫射，逼使我方无法进行修复工作。另一方面他们在此情况下，用尽力量，违反协议片面进行堵口。目前口门水面正加快缩小，并已挖掘引河，国民党派大员至花园口监工，拟于短期内或阳历年底以前，将口门堵塞、放水过来。国民党之恶毒阴谋，至此已无可掩盖。
    我们全区军民，必须全力与国民党的各种阴谋作坚决顽强的斗争。我们除抗议国民党违约，并吁请全国正义人士，共同制止国民党在短期内片面的堵塞口门外，还必须号召并组织全区群众，在全力进行自卫战争中，来进行以下的工作：（一）未修之堤岸与某些必需修筑之险工，须尽速修起来，有可能出险之处，应作抢险准备。（二）河床内居民，应即开始迁移，至少要尽量利用亲友关系，将粮食及笨重东西尽先运出寄存。（三）立即搜集修补与建造船只，政府应即贷款补助。并须有专人组织船夫水手，或成立船户工会，加强教育，使其对渡口和救急能更好服务。（四）设立黄水守望联络，或通讯之类的组织，上下通报堵口情形与水流趋势，以免突然被淹。（五）全区军民应更坚决紧张起来，彻底粉碎蒋介石的整个毒计，积极参军参战，成立人民武装。并坚决执行与完成适应各地当前情况的主要任务（如开展游击战争，与肃清特务等等），以配合我正规兵团，更早的打退并消灭蒋军主力。一则可确保我们控制堤岸，得以完全进行修复工作；再则只有彻底打败蒋军，我们才能免遭任何危害。
    几个月来，我们全区党政军民，对进行自卫战争，及对于黄河问题的斗争，是有很大成绩的。这充分说明：我们有力量能够克服一切困难。今后几个月，将是极度紧张的，全区党政军民，只要更加坚决一致进行各种艰苦斗争，那么我们在这次斗争过程中所受的深重痛苦，与重大损害，在不久就一定要和法西斯独裁者卖国贼蒋介石一一算清。
