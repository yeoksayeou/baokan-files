Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 23rd. To advance self-defense mobilization and production construction, farmer representative conferences have been widely held in Liaoning counties and districts. These conferences elect model representatives according to standards set by the farmer representatives themselves. The standards for electing models include: 1) daring to settle accounts; 2) not being afraid to die and daring to fight the "Central Beards" (中央胡子 - a derogatory term for KMT troops); 3) not putting on airs; 4) being able to endure hardship and willing to work; and 5) being fair in handling affairs. For example, in Tao'an, among the 139 representatives from 94 villages (out of 113 villages in the county), there were more than 70 or 80 such heroic figures. The participants were enthusiastic. As Yang Zhanfan, a representative from Zhiyuan District, said, "Today, everyone should not think that we are done just because we have turned ourselves over. We should organize self-defense teams and militias, and mobilize young people to join the People's Liberation Army to resolutely defeat the reactionaries." Female representative Tian Xiuying said, "Women must also mobilize young people to join the army and not hold them back." When the Tao'an conference passed the resolution to organize a peasant-worker general team, militia hero Wang Huang and Liu Xingwu, the father and son of the work team leader of Daxing District, immediately signed up to join the People's Liberation Army. The Gan'an conference also passed a "wartime pact," and representatives from various districts proposed a competition for enlisting in the army.

　　辽宁县区开农民代表会选举模范推动工作
    【新华社东北二十三日电】辽宁各县区普遍召开了农民代表大会，为了推进自卫动员及生产建设，各地大会选举模范，其标准由农民代表订定。有订定选举模范的标准：一是敢清算；二是不怕死敢打“中央胡子”；三是不摆架子；四是能吃苦肯干活；五是办事公平等。如洮安九十四个屯（全县一一三屯）一三九名代表中，此种英雄人物即在七八十名以上。与会者情绪热烈，如置源区代表杨占泛说：“今天大家不要认为我们翻了身就算了，我们应该组织自卫队民兵，发动青年参加子弟兵，坚决打倒反动派。”女代表田秀英说：“妇女也要动员青年人参军，不拉后腿”。洮安大会通过了组织农工总队时，民兵英雄王煌，大兴区工作队长刘兴武父子，当场报名参加子弟兵。干安大会并通过“战时公约”，各区代表并提出参军竞赛。
