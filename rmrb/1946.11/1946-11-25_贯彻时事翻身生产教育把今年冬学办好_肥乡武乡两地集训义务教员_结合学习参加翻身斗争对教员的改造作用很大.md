　　Train Obligatory Teachers in Feixiang and Wuxiang
　　Combining Study and Participation in the Overturn Struggle Has a Great Effect on the Transformation of Teachers.
　　[Our Newspaper] In order to vigorously carry out the winter school movement and to closely coordinate the work of primary schools and winter schools, Feixiang County specially concentrated more than 300 primary school teachers and winter school teachers for training. Commissioner Wen, Political Commissar Cao, and Section Chief Shi personally participated in the guidance. The training period was 55 days, and it ended successfully on November 8. In order to better conduct overturn education and promote the thorough realization of "land to the tiller" in this year's winter school, students were organized to participate in mass struggle conferences in Beiwanggu and Tiantaishan during the study. When the masses told of the cruel oppression of the landlords and bullies and took off their clothes to show everyone the wounds they had been beaten, many of the students were moved to tears, and a few even raised their fists angrily to hit the bully. This participation in the struggle conference gave everyone a great education. Everyone discussed and said, "This is really better than attending a few days of class. We didn't understand the suffering of the masses before. It is right for the landlords and bullies to return the land and things they exploited from the masses to the masses today." Then everyone made a deep reflection and determined to run the winter school well, earnestly educate the masses, and thoroughly overturn.
　　[Our Newspaper] The Wuxiang County Government has ordered that honorary teachers be selected by the 20th of last month, emphasizing those who have prestige among the masses, and training will begin on the 30th for about a week. The main content is to implement the overturn education of realizing "land to the tiller" and to carry out current affairs education. In order to develop primary school education and spread education to remote areas and mountain villages, primary school teachers are also required to participate.

　　贯彻时事翻身生产教育把今年冬学办好
    肥乡武乡两地集训义务教员
    结合学习参加翻身斗争对教员的改造作用很大
    【本报讯】肥乡县为大力开展冬学运动，并使小学、冬学工作密切配合，特集中小学教员、冬学教员共三百余人进行训练，温专员曹政委史科长并亲自参加指导，训期五十五天，十一月八日圆满结束。为使今年冬学更好的进行翻身教育推动耕者有其田彻底实现，学习中并组织学员实地参加了北王固、天台山的群众斗争大会。当群众诉说地主恶霸的残酷压榨并解开衣服叫大家看他身上被打的伤痕时，学员们不少被感动得掉下泪来，有几个更愤激的举起拳头要打那个恶霸。这次参加斗争会，给大家很大的教育，都纷纷议论说：“这真比上几天课都好，从前咱就不了解群众这样的痛苦，地主恶霸剥削群众的土地东西，今天还给群众是理当的。”接着大家都又作了深刻反省，决心回去把冬学办好，认真教育群众，彻底翻身。
    【本报讯】武乡县府已下令在上月二十日前选出义务教员，品质要着重在群众中有威信的，并于三十日起，开始训练，为期一星期左右。主要因容是贯彻实现耕者有其田的翻身教育，并开展时事教育。为开展小学教育，使教育普及到偏僻地带和山庄，小学教员也一律参加。
