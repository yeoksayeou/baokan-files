　　Regiment Commander Wu and the Hundred Heroes
　　——Stories from the Zhangfengji Annihilation Battle
　　Junshui Kangjian
　　No matter how ferocious and mad the enemy was, they couldn't stop the heroes' fierce and strong attack. Regiment Commander Wu Zhong led a torrent of iron – the heroes of the Third Battalion Headquarters, the Eighth Company, and the Special Service Company – and bravely broke through the enemy's position at Zhangfengji, driving a wedge into the enemy's nest. It hadn't been half an hour since they went in, and the sky was already bright. They only occupied two courtyards, and one courtyard was already completely surrounded by the enemy, with its firepower completely blocked. Although the situation was so unfavorable to us, the heroes' hearts were firm. There was no other way but to hold on. At nine o'clock on the morning of October 6, the enemy began to charge at us under the cover of artillery fire. When the enemy approached, the heroes jumped out of the simple fortifications and launched a bayonet and grenade attack, immediately driving the enemy back. The situation was very urgent. Regiment Commander Wu Zhong made a powerful appeal to the heroes: "Comrades! Is it better to let the enemy come and kill us all, or to kill the enemy so we can live?" The soldiers answered in unison, "We want to kill the enemy, we want to live!" Regiment Commander Wu Zhong smiled and said, "Everyone must be prepared to hold on until dusk. Fraternal troops will join us to wipe out the enemy. Do we have this determination?" Everyone answered in unison, "Yes!" Filled with determination and victorious sentiments, Regiment Commander Wu Zhong happily said: "Good! Let the enemy taste the power of the people's army." The artillery fire intensified, and under the cover of superior firepower, the enemy rushed into the courtyard like a swarm of bees. The alert and calm heroes did not panic. They used grenades and rifles to fire fiercely at the enemy, killing three enemies. The rest scurried away like dogs with their tails between their legs. The planes came, and the enemy launched successive attacks on us. Regiment Commander Wu said: The planes are useless, pay attention to attacking the attacking enemy. In this way, countless charges were repelled by the steadfast heroes. The artillery fire became even more intense. Several holes were made in the roof, and the walls around were riddled with holes. The soldiers began to build fortifications indoors. Regiment Commander Wu also participated in the earthwork. Several times, comrades wanted to replace him, but he said, "Don't distinguish between cadres and soldiers, everyone should do the same." When the enemy's artillery fire was fierce, he always stayed with the soldiers, taking his rifle, grenades, and his own pistol. When the comrades of the machine gun squad didn't shoot accurately, he often stood at the door with a machine gun and counterattacked the enemy fiercely. Comrade Liu Guanghai, the twenty-year-old youth squad leader, was afraid that the regimental commander would be in danger, and suggested, "Regimental Commander, you should go to the shelter!" Regiment Commander Wu said, "If everyone doesn't go into the cave, what am I going to do?" He went everywhere to command and encourage: "Comrades, the fortifications are our lives. With strong fortifications, we have the strength to hold on; otherwise, we cannot hold on until dusk." The situation developed even more tense. On the south wall of the house, the enemy began to dig loopholes. Heavy machine guns from the east and west sides were firing fiercely, and the enemy who broke through the gap in the north was constantly firing at the warriors who were defending in the house. However, the brave and decisive Regiment Commander Wu and his soldiers showed even more determination. The firepower of rocket launchers, light and heavy machine guns roared again. Regiment Commander Wu guarded one side of the door, clearly observed the enemy's situation, and began to report to everyone: "Comrades, the enemy is determined to launch the seventh attack on us. Be prepared, be calm and accurate in your shooting. When the enemy comes up, we will wipe them out!" Sure enough, several enemies came up. Regiment Commander Wu personally held a machine gun and fired fiercely. Our grenades exploded like thunder, and the enemy fell. Wang Ansheng, a Jiang army soldier of the 181st Division, who was liberated in the Battle of Wuzhuang, saw Regiment Commander Wu's composure and ran to the front line, saying, "Fighting with such a regimental commander is more and more energetic. You can't find such a team besides the Communist Party." The enemy's eighth and ninth attacks were weaker than the previous ones. After three hours, Regiment Commander Wu, together with squad leader Gao Yuehua and the pharmacist, guarded one place, for the purpose of facilitating the command of the comrades of the Eighth Company of the Third Battalion and the guard platoon. At that time, a steel-helmeted enemy was found throwing grenades from the loophole on the north wall. Regiment Commander Wu ran over quickly, snatched the enemy's grenade, and threw it back, driving several enemies away. Later, he took the machine gun and shot from the loophole. Unexpectedly, a bullet hit Regiment Commander Wu's neck. He applied medicine and continued to command his troops. Comrade Gao Yuehua, the squad leader, suggested, "Regimental Commander, you are injured, take a rest." "Don't rest, hold on firmly! Don't worry about me, only by holding on firmly can we achieve victory." The sun was setting. The "Peace" Division ×× Regiment began a general attack. Regiment Commander Wu cleverly ordered them to coordinate the shooting, block the breakthrough, and two machine guns rang fiercely behind the enemy. When the enemy turned around, the ×× Regiment had already climbed the encircled village and rushed into Zhangfengji. Regiment Commander Wu fought well, defended firmly, and charged bravely. This is the manifestation of the Bolshevik's noble character and the revolutionary heroism of the people's army. At present, the troops on the Jiluyu front are launching a campaign to learn from the hundred heroes led by Regiment Commander Wu. They defend, as steady as Mount Tai; they attack, as brave as tigers.

　　吴团长和百名英雄
    ——张凤集歼灭战中的故事
    俊水　康健
    不管敌人如何凶恶疯狂，挡不住英雄们的激烈强攻。吴忠团长带着一支铁流——三营营部八连和特务连的英雄们，勇猛的冲破了敌人的阵地——张凤集，就这样在敌人的窝里打进了一个楔子。刚进去没有半小时，天就大亮了。他们占领的只有两个院子，一个院子已被敌人团团的包围了，火力完全封锁着。情况虽然对我们这样不利，可是英雄们的心是坚定的，没有第二条路，只有坚守。十月六日上午九点钟，敌人便开始在炮火掩护下向我们冲锋。当敌人接近的时候，英雄们从简单工事里跳出来，一阵刺刀手榴弹，立刻把敌人赶回去。情况很紧急，吴忠团长向英雄们提出有力的鼓动：“同志们！是叫敌人过来穿死我们好呢？还是把敌人打死，我们活着好呢？”战士们一齐回答：“要打死敌人，我们要活下去！”吴忠团长笑着说：“大家思想上要准备坚守到黄昏，兄弟部队会和我们一起消灭敌人的，我们有没有这个决心？”大家齐声回答：“有！”充满了坚决和胜利的情绪，吴忠团长欣然的说：“好！就叫敌人尝一尝人民军队的厉害。”炮火愈打愈紧敌人在优势炮火掩护下，像窝蜂似的冲进了院子。机警而沉着的英雄们，并不发慌，他们用手榴弹和步枪猛烈的向着敌人开火，打死了三个敌人，其余的像夹尾巴狗一样的逃窜了。飞机来了，敌人又接二连三的向我们进攻。吴团长便说：飞机来了没有用，注意打击进攻的敌人。就这样无数次的冲锋，都被坚守的英雄们击溃了。炮火更急了，房顶上打了几个洞，四周的墙都打的透明了，战士们开始在室内做起工事。吴团长也参加了土工作业，同志们几次要替他，他说：“别分干部战士哪，都要一样干。”当敌人炮火激烈的时候，他总是和战士同志们守在一块，拿了步枪手榴弹和自己的驳壳枪，他们机枪班的同志们打的不准时，他常提着机枪站在门口向敌人猛烈反击。二十岁的青年班长刘光海同志，怕团长有了危险，提议说：“团长，你到荫蔽部里去吧！”吴团长说：“大家不到洞里，我去干什么？”他到各处指挥和鼓励：“同志们，工事就是咱们的生命，有了强固的工事，就等于有了坚守的力量；不然就不能坚持到黄昏。”情况发展的更加紧张了，房子南面的墙上，敌人开始挖枪眼，东、西两面都有敌人的重机枪激烈的射击，北面突破缺口的敌人时刻用火力在射击着我们守在房子里的勇士们。但是，英勇果敢的吴团长和他的战士们，却表现的更加坚毅。火箭炮轻重机枪的火力又在怒吼了。吴团长守在门口的一边，清楚的观察着敌情，开始向大家报告说：“同志们，敌人志在企图发动第七次向我们冲锋，大家准备好，要沉着要准确射击，敌人上来时，咱们残灭他！”真的上来了几个敌人。吴团长亲自抱着机枪猛烈的打了起来。我们的手榴弹打出去如雷一样的响，敌人倒下去了。在吴庄战斗中解放出来的蒋军一八一师上等兵王安生，看到吴团长的沉着，跑到阵地上说：“跟这样的团长越打越有劲，除了共产党，再找不到这样的队伍。”敌人第八第九次的冲锋，一次比一次的软下去。过了三小时光景，吴团长带着班长高月华和司药同志，三个人守在一个地方，目的是为了便利指挥三营八连和警卫排的同志们。当时发现一个戴着钢盔的敌人，从北墙上枪眼里往里扔手榴弹，吴团长机动的跑过去夺了敌人的手榴弹，反打了出去，几个敌人被打跑了。后来又拿了机枪从枪眼里射击，不料一颗子弹射中了吴团长的颈部，他上了药，仍然继续指挥着自己的部队。班长高月华同志建议说，“团长，你负伤了，休息一会吧。”“不休息，坚决的守！别关心我，只有坚决的守，才能得到胜利。”太阳下沉了，“和平”部××团开始总攻了，吴团长机智的命令配合射击，封锁突破口，在敌人背后猛烈的响起了两挺机枪。敌人回过头的时候，××团已登上围寨，冲进张凤集。吴团长打的好，守的坚，冲的勇敢，这是布尔塞维克崇高品质和人民军队革命英雄主义的表现。目前，冀鲁豫前线各部队展开了学习以吴团长为首的百名英雄运动，他们守，稳如泰山；攻，勇如猛虎。
