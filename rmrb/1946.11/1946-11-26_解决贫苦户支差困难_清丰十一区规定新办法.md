　　Solving the Difficulty of Labor Service Contributions for Poor Households
    Qingfeng's Eleventh District Specifies New Measures
    [Report from this newspaper in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area] Qingfeng's Eleventh District, in consideration of the difficulties faced by the masses in production, the livelihood challenges of poor households, and the excessive labor service contributions demanded of livestock, has stipulated new measures for labor service contributions. After several instances of labor service contributions, the masses in Qingfeng's Eleventh District have raised the following three important issues: First, household production cannot be resolved after leaving for labor service; second, the livelihoods of poor households cannot be sustained when they contribute labor service; third, the masses are unwilling to feed livestock. In order to solve these three problems, district cadres, based on the opinions of the masses, have researched the following measures: First, freely form mutual aid production teams, regardless of the number of people, to solve production problems through the mutual aid team. Second, each team assesses labor strength based on poor, middle, and rich peasants, dividing them into four categories: long-distance labor service, short-distance labor service, reduced labor service, and exempted labor service. Poor peasants who cannot sustain their livelihoods and those who rely on petty trade for a living may be granted reduced or exempted labor service, or short-distance labor service, at discretion. Rich peasants are assessed as having ten points of labor, while poor peasants are assessed as having six or five points, as determined by everyone. After the team's assessment is completed, it is submitted to the headquarters for review, and after review, it is entered into the register. Third, when assigning labor service, assignments are made based on the production team; the team with more labor strength is assigned first. After contributing labor service, work points are recorded; the number of laborers sent by each team and the number of days they worked (each day counts as one work point) are recorded in the labor service account book. Accounts are settled once a month, and those who worked less will make up for it next time; or accounts are settled once a laborer has contributed ten work points, and then the next rotation begins. Fourth, for the team's work points, contributing labor service and engaging in production at home are assessed the same number of work points. Those at home are responsible for the entire team's production, and in the end, settlement is based on each household's work, the amount of labor, and the amount of work done. Those who do more work receive wages, and those who do less pay wages, with wages assessed quarterly. Fifth, livestock labor service. Large livestock are assessed as equivalent to two laborers, and small livestock are assessed as equivalent to one or half a laborer; livestock are also counted as each household's labor strength.

　　解决贫苦户支差困难
    清丰十一区规定新办法
    【本报冀鲁豫讯】清丰十一区照顾群众生产及贫苦户生活困难和牲口支差太多，规定支差新办法。清丰十一区经过几次支差后，群众反映了以下三个重要问题：一、出差后家中生产没法解决，二、贫的出差，家中生活没法维持；三、群众都不愿喂牲口。区干为解决这三个问题，特根据群众的意见，研究出以下的办法：一、自由结合生产互助组，不拘人数，由互助组解决生产问题。二、各小组按贫、中、富农评定劳力，分出远差、出近差、减差、免差四种，贫苦农民维持不住生活、和靠做小买卖生活者可酌情减差、免差或出近差。富农顶十分劳力，贫的顶六分、五分，由大家来评定，小组评定好后交指挥部再审查，审好后入册登记。三、派差时就按生产组来派，那个生产组的劳力多就先派那组，出差后记工，各组派了几个劳力，出了几天（每天算一个工），都记在支差账本上，每一个月算一次账，短差的下一次补；或者一个劳动力出十个工算一次账，各人的工出齐了再轮下一次。四小组的记工，出差和在家生产的一样顶工，在家的人负责全组的生产，最后按每户的活，劳动力的多少，做工的多少来清算，做的多的得工资，少的出工资，工资按每季来评定。五、牲口支差。大牲口顶两个劳力，小的顶一个或半个，牲口也算每户的劳动力。
