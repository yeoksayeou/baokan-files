    “Ceasefire” Smoke Screen Self-Defeated
    Chiang's Troops Massing on Three Routes
    Preparing to Invade Yan'an
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th Dispatch] While Chiang Kai-shek announced the so-called "ceasefire," Chiang's troops were mobilizing large forces from all directions, preparing to attack the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and Yan'an, where the CCP Central Committee is located. A portion of the 27th Division under Hu Zongnan has moved from southern Shanxi to an area about 100 li south of Ganquan County in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. Military vehicles are still continuously transporting troops north in areas south of中部 (Zhongbu), Tongguan, and Yijun. The 1st Division and 90th Division of Hu's forces in southern Shanxi are crossing the Yellow River into Shaanxi from Yumen. Two brigades have already arrived in Hancheng, south of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region on the west bank of the Yellow River. In the northwest of the Border Region, the 81st Division's 10th Brigade and the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Regiments of the Baoan forces under Ma Hongda of Ningxia are also crossing the Yellow River east from Ningxia, massing in the Lingwu area west of Yanchi in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. The air surrounding the Border Region has suddenly become tense, and rumors are widespread that the war to attack the Border Region will soon erupt under Chiang Kai-shek's "ceasefire" smokescreen.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Suiyuan-Mongolia Front, 10th Dispatch] On the morning of the 3rd, more than 300 Yan's troops from Ying County sneaked into Huairen City. The soldiers and civilians of the city had already fortified it, leaving nothing behind. Fearing annihilation by the Eighth Route Army, Yan's troops looted grain and fled in panic on the morning of the 4th.
