    Checking the Land Reform in Twenty Counties of Taihang
    The Disparity in Land Reform Between Rich and Poor Villages Should be Comprehensively Addressed Through Leveling and Filling;
    Cadres Must Also Resolve to Eliminate Feudal Exploitation
    [Reported by this newspaper] To implement "leveling and filling" comprehensively and thoroughly resolve the land problem, all regions are conducting land reform inspections. Shahe, Xingtai, Xingtai City, Neiqiu, Lincheng, Gaoyi, Zanhuang, Yuanshi, and Jingxing in the First District; Pindding, Yuci, Heshun, Zuoquan, Xiangyuan, and Changzhi City in the Second District; Anyang and Wu'an in the Third District; and Lingchuan in the Fourth District have all conducted inspections and summaries. From these inspections and summaries, they have correctly recognized the achievements, experiences, and lessons learned from the previous stage. At the same time, they have calmly pointed out the areas where the movement has been insufficient. First, there is still a gap in thoroughly eliminating feudalism. Apart from 49 villages out of 929 administrative villages in the First District not having yet been mobilized, accounting for 5.3%, 8% of the villages in the new Heshun area not having been mobilized, and 4% of the villages in Xiangyuan not having been mobilized, even in the villages that have been mobilized, the elimination of feudalism and assistance to the impoverished to achieve land reform are not thorough enough. Wu Lao Xiang, a traitor and local tyrant in Lincheng, still possesses a large amount of the fruits of the masses' labor. In Daoping Village, Shouyang, there are two impoverished households that have not yet achieved land reform. The biggest problem is still that the degree of land reform between rich and poor villages is too disparate, and "comprehensive leveling and filling" has not been achieved. In the rich village of Dafuyan in Heshun, land and houses have been distributed repeatedly, while in the poor village of Shiyanping, there is little land and no houses to distribute. Secondly, there are many shortcomings and inadequacies in the distribution of fruits, ideological mobilization, organizational construction, and the training and transformation of cadres. According to the inspections, the main reason for the lack of thoroughness is that some cadres still lack the determination to thoroughly eliminate feudalism, and consciously or unconsciously maintain feudal forces in the handling of some specific issues. The two muddled ideas in the Third District of Lincheng are: one is excessively emphasizing care before liquidation, and the other is a one-sided understanding of the lenient policy. Another problem is that the hands have not been truly released to the broad masses, and a few cadres are still taking care of everything. Resolving these ideological problems is extremely important for promoting the movement in the future.
    [Another report] To assist the local areas in thoroughly completing the land reform movement this winter, all 34 students of the "Post-Teacher Class" of Changzhi Normal School have formed a land reform team to go to the countryside. The team is personally led by the school's principal, Zhang, and instructor Zhang, and is now starting work in various districts of Changzhi City. (Ma Zhongmin)

    太行二十县检查翻身
    贫富村翻身程度悬殊应全面进行填平补齐 
    干部还须决心消灭封建剥削
    【本报讯】为贯彻全面“填平补齐”，彻底解决土地问题，全区各地正进行翻身检查。一分区之沙河、邢台、邢市、内邱、临城、高邑、赞皇、元氏、井陉，二分区之平定、榆次、和顺、左权、襄垣、长治市，三分区之安阳、武安，四分区之陵川，均已分别做了检查与总结，从检查与总结中，正确认识了前一段的成绩与经验教训，同时从成绩中，冷静的指出了运动不够的各个方面。首先在彻底消灭封建方面还有距离，除尚有一分区九百二十九个行政村中，四十九个村未运动，占百分之五点三，和顺新区百分之八的村庄未动，襄垣未动者为百分之四外。就是已运动村中，尚有少数村消灭封建与扶助赤贫翻身均不彻底，临城城内汉奸恶霸吴老香，仍霸有群众大量血汗果实，寿阳道坪村有两户赤贫未翻身，最大的一个问题，仍是富村与穷村的翻身程度太悬殊，未能“全面填平补齐”，和顺富村大夫岩房地堆积分了又分，穷村石岩坪少地没房没啥分。其次在果实分配上，思想发动上、组织建设上、干部培养改造上，均有许多缺点和不够的地方。不彻底的主要原因，据检查发现，仍有一些干部对彻底消灭封建的决心不够，在一些具体问题的处理上，自觉不自觉的维护了封建势力，临城三区的两种糊涂思想：一是过分的强调照顾而后清算，一是片面的认识宽大政策。还有是手未真正放给广大群众，仍是几个干部在包办。解决这些思想问题对推动以后运动关系极大。
    【又讯】为协助当地于今冬彻底完成土地改革运动，长治师范“后师班”全体同学三十四人组成翻身队下乡。该队由该校张校长，张教导员亲自领导，现已在长治市各区开始工作。（马忠民）
