　　Juye County Pursuit and Annihilation Battle
    On October 31st, in less than three hours from dusk to dark, the People's Ever-Victorious Army, after encircling and annihilating the main force of the invading army in Liujiazhuang and Renzhuang, ten miles southeast of Juye County, completed an intense and thorough pursuit and annihilation battle.

    Airplanes circled and strafed all afternoon, finally flying away helplessly. The remnants of the 29th Brigade headquarters and the 355th Regiment were stationed in this area, still blindly bombarding with hand grenade launchers allocated by Chiang Kai-shek's Ministry of National Defense. However, the soldiers who had moved into battle positions emerged from their hiding places and gathered to advance. Hou Bin, an old man from Houhu Village, pointed to the advancing ranks and said, "Jiang Ziya's heavenly soldiers and generals are going to clean up the bad guys who harm the people!"

    Comrade Lu Nanchiao, the brigade political commissar, instructed the 3024th unit over the phone with the order to "attack from south to north": "Two things must be prepared at the same time, attack Liu Jiazhuang to eliminate them, and if they break through, pursue and eliminate them!"

    As dusk approached, in Fengwo Village, three miles northeast of Liu Jiazhuang, Battalion Instructor Comrade Fang Baichun was addressing the assembled soldiers. The dense sound of machine guns was boiling in front, and branches on the trees were constantly being shot down. The comrades waited nervously and excitedly. Suddenly, a sweating messenger ran over and shouted, "The enemy has fled!" The battalion instructor immediately issued an emergency order, and the team ran out from the right side of the village. One soldier shouted to another soldier who was holding a steel helmet in his left hand and a pickaxe in his right, "Are you going to use a pickaxe to disarm their guns?" The one who had just captured the American helmet put it on his head and said unconvincingly, "Never mind, I definitely have a way." The cook who was delivering food dropped his burden and rushed out to seize the enemy's guns.

    Twenty-eight trucks, with machine guns mounted, driven at full speed carrying the Chiang's troops, crashed into the south like rats seeking holes. The soldiers pursued, throwing hand grenades at them, the shouts of "Hand over your guns!" mingled with the shouts of killing, quickly chasing to the south.

    The rescue team members who were ordered to stay in Fengwo Village anxiously discussed, "Have they escaped?"

    "Where to run?" A messenger returning from the front line wiped his sweat and replied, "The troops have all chased after them, they definitely can't escape!"

    Under the tree, Political Commissar Lu reported to the headquarters on the phone: "The troops are moving very quickly, but there are too many and too fast, and it is not clear how many have been taken. The 3024th unit reported that they captured four trucks and two howitzers as soon as they started."

    The battle ended victoriously, and the troops moved to the new garrison. Tonight's night march was not as quiet as before, and the soldiers were loudly talking about their stories of chasing and capturing cannons, capturing cars, and the enemy begging for mercy. Two beams of light shone from behind, and the car captured an hour ago drove over. Brigade Commander Ma Tongzhong and Chief of Staff Shi Jingban stood up from the carriage. "Annihilated, completely annihilated!" Brigade Commander Ma waved his hand and said, "Come up and sit for a while, this driver is not bad!" The driver Wang Yanhui's clothes and shoes were wet from falling into the river, and now he was wearing the coat and shoes that Brigade Commander Ma had lent him. The unexpected kindness of the Eighth Route Army quickly made him forget the terror of an hour ago. He smoked a cigarette and said, "You charged really fiercely, we were simply panic-stricken, I can't say. But I know that the Eighth Route Army gives preferential treatment to technicians and preferential treatment to prisoners."

    Wang Yanhui closed the car door, skillfully gripped the steering wheel, and the car started again. His expression was relaxed and happy, no longer as frightened as before.

　　鄄城追歼战
    十月卅一日，从黄昏到天黑不到三个钟头的时间，鄄城东南十里的刘家庄、任庄一带人民常胜军继围歼进犯军主力之后，完成了一场紧张而彻底的追击歼灭战。
    飞机盘旋扫射了一下午，终于无可奈何的飞走了。在这一带驻着残存的二十九旅旅部及三五五团，仍不断用蒋介石国防部配属的手榴弹炮盲目轰击。但是运动到战斗位置的战士们，却从隐蔽处走出来，集结前进。侯户村的老汉侯斌指着前进的行列说：“姜子牙的天兵天将，去收拾害老百姓的坏蛋哪！”
    旅政治委员卢南樵同志在电话里指示着三○二四部“由南往北攻击”的命令：“两件事同时都要准备好，攻进刘家庄消灭他，如果突围，就追击消灭他！”
    天将黄昏，在刘家庄东北三里的蜂窝村，营教导员方柏春同志正在向集结的战士们讲话，前面浓密的机枪声沸腾似的响着，树上的枝叶不时被击落下来，同志们紧张而兴奋的等待着。突然一个满头大汗的通讯员跑来喊着：“敌人跑了！”营教导员立刻下了紧急命令，队伍从村右边飞跑出去，一个战士向另一个左手握钢盔右手拿洋镐的战士叫道：“难道你用镐去缴人家的枪吗？”那一个把刚缴获的美国盔戴到头上，很不服气的说：“别多管，我当然有办法。”送饭的炊事员丢下担子也冲出去缴敌人的枪去了。
    二十八辆汽车开足马力，载着架有机枪的蒋军像老鼠找洞似的向南乱撞，战士们追着用手榴弹掷上去，“缴枪！”和喊杀声混成一片，向南迅速的追去。
    奉令留在蜂窝村的救护队员们，焦急的议论着：“是不是跑掉了呢？”
    “往那里跑？”一个从火线上回来的通讯员擦着汗回答道：“队伍都追上去了，反正跑不脱的！”
    树底下的卢政委打电话向司令部报告：“部队动作很迅速，但太多太快，并不清楚到底搞了多少，三○二四来信，他们一上手就缴到四辆汽车，两门榴弹炮。”
    战斗胜利的结束了，部队向新驻地移防，今夜的夜行军不像以前那样静肃，战士们高声讲说着自己追击缴炮缴汽车和敌人求饶的故事。后面射来两道电光，一小时以前缴到的汽车开了过来，马同忠旅长和史景班参谋长从车厢里站起来。“消灭了，完全消灭了！”马旅长挥着手说：“上来坐一坐吧，这位司机还不错哩！”司机王言会的衣服和鞋子都在掉下河时浸湿了，现在穿着马旅长借给他的大衣和鞋子。八路军意外的和善亲切，使他很快的忘却了一小时以前的恐怖，他吸着纸烟说：“你们冲的真凶呀，我们简直惊慌得一塌糊涂，不能说了。可是我知道八路军优待技术人员优待俘虏的。”
    王言会关上车门，熟练地握住方向盘，汽车又重开动，他的表情轻松而愉快，再不像那么惊惶了。
