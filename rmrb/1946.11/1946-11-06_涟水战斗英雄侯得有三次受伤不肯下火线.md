　　Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 2nd. Hou Deyou, the deputy captain of the Seventh Company of a certain column of the New Fourth Army who participated in the Battle of Lienshui, was awarded the title of First-Class Combat Hero. On October 20th, in the fierce battle south of Lienshui city, Hou was wounded in the head by shrapnel. The deputy team leader advised him to go down and rest. At first, he firmly refused, but was later forced to rest in the dressing station for a while. The next day (22nd), Chiang's army continued to attack the New Fourth Army's position outside the south gate of the city. Hou could no longer bear it, and regardless of the pain of his wound, he went back to the front line with a basket of bombs. Together with the political instructor of the company, he repelled the Chiang army's charge at the forefront. When Chiang's army charged again, news came that the company commander was wounded. Hou volunteered to go to the front line as acting commander and used a large number of bombs to cover the retreat of the troops. Finally, Hou retreated to the south gate and stubbornly held the fortifications alone. At this time, reinforcements from the New Fourth Army counterattacked. Hou led his troops to jump onto the city wall and fight Chiang's army. His thigh was wounded again by artillery fire. At this point, Hou had been wounded three times and was covered in blood and mud. The battalion commander came over to persuade him to rest, but was refused again. Instead, he encouraged his subordinates to hold on and not let an enemy climb the city wall. The battle finally ended in victory, and the invading army was wiped out under Lienshui city. The leaders of the column have now issued an order to commend him, promote Hou Deyou to company commander, award him a First-Class Cadre Combat Hero certificate, and call on commanders and fighters at all levels to learn from him.

　　涟水战斗英雄侯得有三次受伤不肯下火线
    【新华社华中二日电】参与涟水保卫战之新四军某纵队七中队副队长侯得有荣获一等战斗英雄头衔。十月廿日，涟水城南激战中，侯头部受弹片击伤，大队副劝他应下去休息。他起初坚执不肯，后被迫在包扎所休息了一下。次日（廿二），蒋军继续进攻南门外新四军阵地，侯再也忍耐不住了，不顾伤口的疼痛，带着一筐炸弹重上火线，与该中队政治指导员在最前面打退了蒋军的冲锋。当蒋军再度冲锋时，中队长挂彩消息传来，侯又自动上前线代理，并以投掷大批炸弹，掩护了部队的转移。最后侯退至南门口，一个人坚守工事抵抗，这时新四军增援反击，侯率部跃上城头与蒋军搏战，大腿又受炮伤，至此侯三次受伤，已满身血迹泥沙。大队长走来劝他休息，复遭拒绝。他反而鼓励部下坚守，不要让一个敌人爬上城头，战斗终于胜利结束，进犯军在涟水城下被消灭了。现该纵队首长已传令嘉奖，并擢升侯得有为中队长，授以一等干部战斗英雄奖状，并号召各级指战员向他学习。
