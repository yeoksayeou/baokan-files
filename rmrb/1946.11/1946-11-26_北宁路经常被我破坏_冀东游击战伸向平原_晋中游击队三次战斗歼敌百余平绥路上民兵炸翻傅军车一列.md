Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 22nd: The 440,000 militiamen in the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region are spread across various battlefields, assisting field armies and local armed forces, containing, besieging, and annihilating invading Chiang troops. The Jidong mass guerrilla warfare is developing from the mountainous areas inside the Great Wall to the plains along the Luan River and the Grand Canal. According to incomplete statistics, in recent months, in the three military sub-districts, in 224 self-defense counterattacks and 96 explosions, 619 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers were killed or wounded, and 233 long and short guns were captured. The Beining Railway, the main transportation artery of the Chiang Kai-shek troops inside and outside Shanhaiguan, is frequently damaged by tens of thousands of armed militiamen. In mid-last month, hundreds of thousands of militiamen in central and western Hebei, who participated in the counterattack campaigns on various fronts, created great and glorious achievements. More than 40,000 militiamen from eight counties, including Wangdu, Quyang, and Xingtang, participated in the war, along with 4,000 transport vehicles and 4,000 stretchers, completely destroying more than 250 *li* of railway subgrade, 31 strongholds, and five locomotives, and capturing one artillery piece. Militiamen in Shangyi, Wanquan, and other counties are actively active, and the Chiang Kai-shek troops are completely in a state of panic. In the Xuanhua and Xiahuayuan areas, the sound of guerrillas can be heard even during the day. In the local battles to defend their hometowns, a large number of militia combat heroes have emerged. Li Hunzi, the "landmine king" of Xinle in central Hebei, blew up three trains and one armored vehicle of Chiang Kai-shek's troops between Xinle and Changshou on the Pinghan Road in half a month. Liu Jingqi, a farmer from Beicun Village in Tang County, participated in the Wangjing battle on the Pinghan Road and went back and forth on the front lines to rescue seven wounded soldiers.
    Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 23rd: A regiment of Yan Xishan's troops stationed at the Shiqianfeng stronghold in Yangqu, Jinzhong, attacked the two towns of Hekou in the southwest of Yangqu city and Zuojiaohe, ten *li* west of the city, on the 11th of this month. A platoon of local guerrillas rose up to resist, and after a day and night of fierce fighting, they killed or wounded more than 40 Yan troops before safely breaking through the encirclement. On the 29th of last month, the Jiaocheng guerrillas killed more than 40 members of Feng Yunjiu's troops of Yan troops who attacked from Jiaocheng in Ancun, northeast of the city, captured 26 people including company commander Wang Zixiang alive, and seized 2 machine guns, 1 submachine gun, and 17 rifles. The Pingjie militia destroyed the Biancun Public Office of Yan Xishan in Xibao, east of the Fen River, in a swift action at dawn on the 6th, killing or wounding seven Yan puppet personnel. At the same time, the militia in the county laid landmines in Jiangjiabu Village, killing eight Yan troops, including the machine gun company commander.
    Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 20th: On the 23rd of last month, the militia in the Fu troops' occupied area in southern Sui blew up a train of Fu troops' eastern advance near Sandao Camp on the Ping-Sui Road. In the last ten days of last month, more than 40 Fu troops harassed the road from Xintang to Tianjiazhen and triggered landmines pre-laid by the militia, killing or wounding six people, and immediately fled back. Personnel from various township and Bao Public Offices near Liangcheng fled one after another. From October 11th to the 5th of this month, the guerrillas and militia in the border area of Qingshuihe, Pinglu, and Huairen killed, wounded, or captured more than 60 Fu troops, including three officers at the school level, and seized 36 long and short guns.
