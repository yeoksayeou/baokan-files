Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st. Li Weihan (Luomai), the CCP representative stationed in Nanjing, who recently returned to Yan'an, answered the following questions posed by this agency's reporter:

(Q) What are the views of the people of Beijing and Shanghai regarding the "National Assembly"?

(A) When Chiang's National Assembly was hastily cobbled together and began its performance, Chiang's government simultaneously intensified its conscription of soldiers. Under this clear contrast, the masses understood that Chiang's National Assembly would bring them not peace and democracy, but greater civil war and more cruel oppression and exploitation. Industries and businesses in Beijing and Shanghai are teetering on the brink, with some 30,000 factories and shops about to close down. The Shanghai business community harbors no illusions about Chiang's National Assembly. Apart from the Kuomintang's official newspapers and their kept press touting and praising it, all sectors of public opinion in Beijing and Shanghai either openly criticized Chiang's National Assembly or expressed their anger through news reports, cartoons, and other forms. People view the opposition and boycott of Chiang's National Assembly by the CCP, the Democratic League, and the vast number of democratic人士 inside and outside the Kuomintang as an upholding of the people's righteousness. Many groups and figures within the democratic front are preparing to cope with the new oppression that Chiang's National Assembly will bring them. Criticism, satire, cold indifference, and preparation for future days – these are the various responses of the people of Beijing and Shanghai to Chiang's National Assembly.

(Q) What are the views of the people of Beijing and Shanghai regarding Chiang's troops' attack on Yan'an?

(A) Chiang Kai-shek's government exhausted all means to conceal its preparations for attacking Yan'an, but did not succeed. All those who knew of this conspiracy believed that this was a huge military gamble by Chiang Kai-shek, especially a desperate act of his as he was trapped in a politically dead end. They sincerely hoped and believed that the military and civilians of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region would certainly rise up to smash Chiang's troops' attack in order to defend the democratic holy land that the people of the whole country yearned for. Today, the entire hope of the broad masses of democratic人士 is pinned on the victory of the comprehensive resistance of the military and civilians in the liberated areas.

(Q) What is the impact of the Sino-American Commercial Treaty on China?

(A) The Sino-American Commercial Treaty hands over to Americans the rights that the Chinese people can hardly enjoy on their own soil, treating the United States as its own dear father. This is the most shameful treaty in history, and its impact on China is self-evident.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 21st. More than 100 representatives from all walks of life in Nenjiang Province gathered on the afternoon of the 18th and unanimously pointed out that the "National Assembly" convened by Chiang Kai-shek was nothing more than a memorial service for himself. Chairman Yu Yifu said: "This National Assembly must have the word 'Party' added to it, called the 'Kuomintang National Assembly,' to be true to its name. The 'National Assembly' convened by the Kuomintang this time is no different from the false National Representatives Conference convened by Yuan Shikai when he proclaimed himself emperor, and the 'Piglet Congress' of Cao Kun's bribery election." He also listed the fact that the "National Assembly representatives" of the nine northeastern provinces were all handpicked and designated by the Kuomintang. Among them, two have already stated that they cannot represent the people of Harbin and have refused to participate in the "National Assembly." Please tell me, where are those so-called "National Assembly representatives" of Harbin? How can one talk about representing the people of Harbin?

　　京沪人民痛恨蒋贼召开伪国大
    热望解放区抵抗胜利
    李维汉同志答新华社记者
    【新华社延安二十一日电】前日返抵延安的中共驻京代表李维汉（罗迈），顷答本社记者所提出的几个问题如下：
    （问）京沪人民对“国大”的观感如何？
    （答）蒋记国大七拼八凑开始扮演的时候，蒋记政府同时如火如荼地加紧征兵拉丁。人民大众在此显明对照下，明白蒋记国大将要带给他们的不是什么和平民主，而是更大的内战与更残酷的压迫剥削。京沪工商业摇摇欲坠，有三万来家的工厂商店即将倒闭；上海实业界对蒋记国大不存任何幻想。除国民党机关报及其御用报纸自吹自擂外，京沪各舆论界对蒋记国大或则公开指责，或则通过新闻报导、漫画及其他形式表示他们的愤怒。人们对中共、民盟及国民党内外广大民主人士之反对与抵制蒋记国大，认为是人民正气的仲张。许多民主阵线下的团体和人物，正在准备应付蒋记国大行将带给他们的新的压迫，批评、讽刺、冷眼、漠然，与对未来日子的准备，这些就是京沪人民对蒋记国大的各种回答。
    （问）京沪人民对蒋军进攻延安的观感如何？
    （答）蒋介石政府用尽一切方法掩盖其进攻延安之准备，但没有成功。知道此种阴谋的所有人们，都认为这是蒋介石在军事上的巨大冒险，尤其是他在政治上陷于穷途末路的绝望行动。他们衷心希望并相信陕甘宁边区的军民一定能够奋起粉碎蒋军的进攻，以保卫成为全国人民所盼望的民主圣地。今天，广大民主人士的全部希望都寄托在解放区军民全面抵抗的胜利上面。
    （问）蒋美商约对于中国的影响如何？
    （答）蒋美商约把中国人民在中国本土上难以享受的权利双手奉送给美国人，把美国当成他的亲爸爸，这是历史上所没有的最可耻的条约，其对中国的影响不言可知。
    【新华社东北二十一日电】嫩江省各界代表一百余人于十八日下午聚会，一致指出蒋介石所召开之“国民大会”，就是给他自己召开的追悼会。于毅夫主席说：“这个国民大会必须加上一个‘党’字，叫做‘国民党大会’，才能名符其实。此次国民党召开之‘国大’，与袁世凯称帝时召开之伪国民代表会议及曹锟贿选的‘猪仔国会’并无二致。”他并列举东北九省“国大代表”均为国民党一手包办所圈定。其中已有二人说他们不能代表哈市人民，并拒绝参加“国大”。请问那些所谓哈市“国大代表”根本就没有，那里能谈得上代表哈尔滨人民呢？
