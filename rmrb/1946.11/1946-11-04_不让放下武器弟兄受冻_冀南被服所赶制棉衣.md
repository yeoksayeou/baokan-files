　　So Brothers Who Lay Down Their Weapons Won't Freeze
    Jinnan Clothing Factory Rushes to Make Cotton Clothes
    [Report from our Weixian office on the 26th] As the weather has turned colder recently, the clothing factory has completed tens of thousands of sets of cotton clothes with great enthusiasm and speed and sent them to the self-defense front. However, a large number of Chiang Kai-shek soldiers have been captured recently, without clothes or quilts. The military region's clothing factory responded to the call from higher authorities to express the greatest friendship to the Chiang Kai-shek soldiers who laid down their weapons, and once again launched a crash program. The clothing workers are working with doubled enthusiasm to process and rush to make them. The personnel left behind in the rear have also decided to postpone the distribution of winter clothes and first send their own cotton clothes to the Chiang Kai-shek brothers who laid down their weapons. Everyone treats them as family members, guaranteeing that they will not freeze in the winter. Last month on the 12th, a large number of cotton clothes and two thousand five hundred and twenty cotton quilts were sent to the front lines.

    冀南被服所赶制棉衣
    【本报威县二十六日电】近日天气渐寒，被服所已以高度热情和速度，完成数万套棉衣，送至自卫前线。但近来俘虏了大批蒋军士兵，无衣无被，军区被服所响应上级号召，对蒋军放下武器弟兄表示最大的友爱，再次展开了突击工作，被服工人热情百倍，加工赶做。留守后方人员亦决定缓发冬衣，先把自己的棉衣送给放下武器的蒋军弟兄们。大家对他们当作一家人看待，冬天来了保证不让受冻。上月十二日已把大批棉衣与二千五百二十床棉被送上前线。
