    How Shameless!
    American Beauties Show Movies to "Comfort" Chiang's Soldiers Fighting in Central China
    Xinhua News Agency, Central China, November 8th: Newly liberated Chiang Kai-shek soldiers from the LianShui battle on October 31st, at a forum somewhere on the front lines, exposed much about American imperialism encouraging Chiang Kai-shek to fight the civil war. Wang Yuancheng, a first-class soldier from the Ninth Company of the 151st Regiment of the 51st Brigade of Chiang Kai-shek's 74th Division, said: "On the 25th, three Americans came to our garrison in Machang (25 miles east of Huaiyin) and showed movies for two nights. One American went on stage to give a speech, saying they were specially here to comfort our front-line troops, and hoped that after we won the battle, they would show more movies for us." Speaking of this, he angrily cursed: "Chiang Kai-shek wants dictatorship, and calls on the Americans to encourage fighting the civil war. It is really shameful!"

    好不要脸！
    美人放电影“慰劳”华中作战蒋士兵
    【新华社华中八日电】上月三十一日下午涟水战役中新获解放的蒋军士兵，于前线某地座谈时事，对美帝国主义鼓励蒋介石打内战，多所揭露。蒋军七十四师五十一旅一五一团九连一等兵王远成说：二十五日那天，三个美国人到我们的驻地马厂（淮阴东二十五里）放映了两晚电影，一个美国人登台演说，说他们是特来慰劳我们前方部队的，并希望打胜仗以后，再放映给我们看。说到这里，他愤恨地骂着：“蒋介石要独裁，叫美国人来鼓励打内战，实在丢脸”。
