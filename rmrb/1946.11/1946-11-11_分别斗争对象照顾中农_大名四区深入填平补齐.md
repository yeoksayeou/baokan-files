    Separate Struggle Targets, Care for Middle Peasants
    Deepening the Land Reform Movement in the Fourth District of Daming to Fill Gaps and Make Improvements
    [Our Newspaper, Weixian, 6th Dispatch] Since the middle of last month, the movement to fill gaps and make improvements in all seven sub-districts of the Fourth District of Daming has been fully launched, struggling against 148 treacherous despots and landlords. In addition, 72 people with middle peasant backgrounds who were special agents and corrupt puppet village chiefs were dealt with. These people were only asked to admit their mistakes and correct themselves to the masses, and were not subjected to economic punishment. During this period, the Fourth District had the following experiences in grasping the policy towards middle peasants: (1) Unify thinking, so that cadres understand that uniting middle peasants and absorbing them into the movement is the key to uniting the majority of peasants. Specific care should be taken when dealing with specific problems, not just empty slogans. (2) When poor villages demand to struggle against wealthy middle peasants, mobilize activists to examine and clarify how the middle peasants became wealthy. Explain that although middle peasants also have shortcomings such as being stingy and miserly, and even some engage in usury or corruption, these shortcomings and mistakes can be educated and criticized in the peasant association to make them correct themselves, and disputes can be resolved through mediation. In one village, a middle peasant did not give enough rice when selling it, and everyone wanted to punish him. After discussion by activists, they said that this was a common problem in business. The masses said: "This is a small matter, let's forget it! Just ask him to admit his mistake." In order to solve the land problem in small villages without landlords, encourage small villages to seek help from outside villages, and at the same time mobilize large villages to donate wealth and land to poor villages. (3) When wealthy middle peasants are affected by the struggle and have misconceptions, and want to donate wealth and land "voluntarily," the peasant association should analyze the reasons for their "voluntariness," explain and comfort them, so that they do not fear, admit their mistakes if they have made them, and welcome them to participate in the movement.

    分别斗争对象照顾中农
    大名四区深入填平补齐
    【本报威县六日电】大名四区自上月中旬起，全区七个小区的填平补齐运动已全面展开，斗争了奸霸地主等一百四十八人。另处理了中农成份的特务与贪污伪村长等七十二人。对这些人的问题只是让他们向群众认错改过，并未予经济上的处罚。在这一时期中，四区掌握中农政策上，有如下经验：（一）统一思想，使干部明确团结中农、吸收中农参加运动，是团结农民大多数的关键。在处理具体问题时要具体照顾，不是空喊。（二）小穷村要求斗争富裕中农时，要动员积极分子检讨，弄明白中农是如何致富的。说明中农虽也有小气、吝啬等缺点，甚至部分的放过高利贷或有贪污情事，但这些缺点错误可以在农会中开展教育与批评，使其改过，并经过调解解决纠纷问题。某村一个中农卖米时给的不够数，大家要罚他，后经积极分子讨论，说做生意都有这个毛病，群众说：“这是小事，算了吧！叫他承认错误就行。”为了解决没有地主的小村土地问题，提倡小村向外村求援，同时发动大村赠财赠地给贫村。（三）富裕中农受斗争影响，发生错觉，要自动献财献地时，农会要分析他“自动”的原因，进行解释、安慰，使他不要恐惧，有错则认错，并欢迎他参加运动。
