　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 30th—Chairman Lin Feng of the Northeast Political Committee, in a statement to reporters regarding the large-scale offensive by Chiang's troops in Southern Manchuria, said: Chiang Kai-shek's attack on Andong and other places makes it impossible for anyone to have any more illusions about Chiang Kai-shek's so-called "peace" gesture. The eyes of the people of Northeast China are sharp. After fourteen years of painful experience and fighting history, they have also gained political experience and a war of self-defense in the past year. They have long known who are the friends of the people of Northeast China and who are the enemies of the Chinese people. The heroic and unyielding people of Northeast China are determined to fight to the end for national independence, peace, and democracy, and use facts to shatter the Kuomintang warlord Chen Cheng's arrogant dream of "eliminating the liberated areas by force in three to five months." Chairman Lin said that when Japanese imperialism occupied Northeast China, Japan was full of "Sino-Japanese friendship" and the Kuomintang authorities were full of "cordial relations." Both sides sacrificed the Chinese people, especially the people of Northeast China. Today, the United States is full of "Sino-American friendship," and the Kuomintang authorities are full of "cordial relations." Both sides are still sacrificing the people of Northeast China and the Chinese people. Chairman Lin said: Today, the warlords and bureaucrats in the Kuomintang-controlled areas of Northeast China call the people of Northeast China "natives" or "slaves of a fallen country," conscripting soldiers and grain, engaging in corruption and brutality, which is no different from the enemy and puppet era. Many Northeast compatriots who fled to Guan Nei are still being oppressed and cannot return home. On the other hand, in the Northeast Liberated Areas, the people have become their own masters, established democratically elected governments at all levels and the people's armed forces, and distributed more than 200,000 hectares of land belonging to enemies, puppets, and traitors to farmers. Industry and commerce are also gradually recovering and developing, and are preparing to enter an unprecedented great production movement. Everywhere is in sharp contrast with the Kuomintang-controlled areas. The people of Northeast China yearn for genuine peace to facilitate construction; this peace is only possible under the conditions of restoring the full effect of the January 10th truce order and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. However, today, the so-called "peace" of the Kuomintang reactionaries proves in fact to be just a smokescreen for their offensive, just to make the liberated people slaves again. Under such circumstances, the people of Northeast China must heighten their vigilance, strengthen unity, vow to prepare for a long-term struggle to completely smash the offensive of Chiang's troops, recover Andong and all other lost territories, and seek the realization of genuine peace.

　　林枫主席揭穿蒋介石“和平”烟幕
    号召东北人民长期斗争
    收复一切失地收复安东
    【新华社东北三十日电】东北政委会主席林枫为蒋军大举进攻南满事对记者发表谈话称：蒋介石对安东等地的进攻，使任何人对于蒋介石的所谓“和平”姿态都不能再有幻想。东北人民的眼睛是雪亮的，他们在有十四年的惨痛经验和战斗历史以后，又增加了过去一年的政治经验和自卫战争，早已知道谁是东北人民之友，谁是中国人民之敌。英勇不屈的东北人民，决心为民族独立与和平民主而战斗到底，用事实来粉碎国民党军阀陈诚“三五个月就可以用武力消灭解放区”的狂妄梦想。林主席说，回忆当日本帝国主义占领东北时，日本满口“中日亲善”，国民党当局满口“敦睦邦交”，双方都以中国人民首先是东北人民为牺牲品。今天美国又是满口“中美亲善”，国民党当局又是满口“敦睦邦交”，双方仍是以东北人民和中国人民为牺牲品。林主席说：今天东北蒋管区的军阀官僚竟呼东北人民为“土著”或“亡国奴”，征兵征粮，贪污残暴，与敌伪时代无异。而流亡关内的许多东北同胞，至今仍受压迫，有家归不得。反观东北解放区，则人民自己作了主人，建立了民选各级政府和人民的武力，二十多万顷敌伪汉奸土地分配给农民，工商业也日趋恢复与发展，正准备着进入空前的大生产运动。处处都与蒋管区成为尖锐的对比。东北人民渴望真正的和平，以利建设；这种和平，只有在恢复一月十日停战令与政协决议的全部效力的条件下才有可能。但今天国民党反动派的所谓“和平”，事实却证明只是其进攻的烟幕，只是要解放了的人民重新做奴隶。在这种情形下，东北人民必须提高警惕，坚强团结，誓死准备长期的斗争，以彻底粉碎蒋军的进攻，以收复安东及其他一切失地，并求得真正和平的实现。
