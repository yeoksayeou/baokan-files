Catching Plainclothes
　　
　　Gu Weijin

　　Militia hero Li Jinbiao lay in the cornfield next to Daxing Village, waiting for the Kuomintang plainclothes soldiers coming out of Fushan City. This place was only two li away from Fushan. The wind blew the corn leaves, making a rustling sound. Several times, Li Jinbiao thought the enemy plainclothes soldiers had arrived, and he quickly poked half his head out to look, but the road was quiet and there was no one in sight. He could only shrink back in disappointment.

　　After a while, he looked at Xiao Xi, who was standing on the high ground, and said, "Xiao Xi, do you see anything?" "Ah! Nothing yet." He and Xiao Xi weren't very familiar originally. He had just asked Xiao Xi, "Are you willing to fight Chiang Kai-shek?" "Of course I am. The Kuomintang army has ravaged our village to the point where there are hardly any people left." Xiao Xi said, asking Li Jinbiao for a hand grenade. Li Jinbiao made a condition with Xiao Xi: Xiao Xi had to stand on the high ground and act as his lookout, and if he saw the enemy coming, he would tell him. If they caught a prisoner, he would give Xiao Xi a hand grenade. Xiao Xi happily agreed, but after waiting so long and not seeing anyone coming, he felt as anxious as Li Jinbiao. Standing there, he turned his head to look enviously at Li Jinbiao's hand grenade, then hurriedly turned back to look ahead.

　　A burst of footsteps broke the silence of the wild field. Xiao Xi looked up and saw two guys in black plainclothes in front of him, already loudly asking him, "Hey, kid, are there any 'old eights' in the village?" "Nope, nope." Xiao Xi alertly replied loudly. Over there, Li Jinbiao and another militiaman in the cornfield had prepared their weapons. The footsteps got closer, and the two plainclothes soldiers swaggered over. Li Jinbiao and the other man suddenly jumped out in front of them and surrounded the two plainclothes soldiers, shouting, "Stop!" The opponents panicked and hurriedly reached into their pockets for guns. Li Jinbiao pulled the fuse on the hand grenade and said, "Come on, try it and see if yours is more powerful or mine is." As he was speaking, he suddenly jumped up and hugged one of the plainclothes soldier's waist. "I... surrender my gun... Eighth Route... Comrade..." The plainclothes soldier was so frightened that he couldn't speak. As Li Jinbiao was walking back with the plainclothes soldier, Xiao Xi jumped and shouted in front of them, "Give me the hand grenade, give me the hand grenade!" Li Jinbiao smiled at the child and casually stuffed a hand grenade into his hand. Xiao Xi happily jumped away.

　　捉便衣
    古维进
    民兵英雄李金标，伏在大邢村边的玉茭地里，等待着从浮山城出来的蒋军便衣。这里离浮山只有二里地。风吹着玉茭叶沙沙地响，有几次李金标都以为是敌人的便衣来了，连忙伸出半个脑袋向外瞧，但是路上静悄悄的没一个人影，只有失望地又缩回来。
    一会，他望着站在高地上的小喜说：“小喜，瞧见没有？”“啊！还没啥呢。”本来他和小喜并不很熟，刚才他问小喜“愿不愿打蒋介石？”“怎么不愿，蒋军把咱村糟塌得快没人啦。”小喜说着就让李金标给他一棵手榴弹。李金标便和小喜讲了一个条件：要小喜站在高地上替他当哨兵，发现敌人来就告诉他一声。若是捉住了俘虏，就给小喜一个手榴弹。小喜高兴地答应了，可是等了那么久还不见有人来，心里也像李金标一样着急。站在那里，扭回头羡慕地望一眼李金标的手榴弹，又急忙回头向前探望。
    一阵脚步声冲破了野地里的沉寂，小喜抬头看，前面两个穿黑色便衣的家伙已经高声向他问起话来：“喂，小孩，村里有老八没有，”“没啥、没啥。”小喜机警地高声答应。那边，玉茭地里的李金标已和另一个民兵准备好武器。脚步声近了，两个便衣大摇大摆的走过来，李金标两个人猛地一下就跳到他们跟前把两个便衣包围住了，喝声“站住！”对方慌慌张张的赶快向怀里摸手枪。李金标拉开了手榴弹上的火线说：“来，试试看，是你的厉害还是我的厉害。”正说着忽然猛一下跳上去抱住了一个便衣的腰。“我…缴枪……八路…同志……”那个便衣吓得说不出话来。李金标带着便衣往回走的时候，小喜在他们面前跳着叫着：“给我手榴弹，给我手榴弹哪！”李金标望着这孩子笑了，顺手把一颗手榴弹塞到他手里，小喜高兴的跳着走了。
