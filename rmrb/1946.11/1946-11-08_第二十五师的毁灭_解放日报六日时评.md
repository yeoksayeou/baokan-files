　　The Destruction of the 25th Division
　　Following the great victories in the battles of Lianshui, Baoding, and Yucheng within the passes, came the joyous news from outside the passes that the Northeast Democratic Allied Army had annihilated the entire 25th Division of the Chiang army in the Kuandian-Huanren area. Just ten days before, Du Yuming, after occupying Andong, was so ecstatic that he openly declared he would launch a major offensive in the Northeast. He boasted to a United Press reporter that "the winter climate favors the Nationalist army because their cold-weather clothing and equipment are far superior to those of the Communist army." Yet, in a short time, not far from Andong—in the Kuandian-Huanren area—the heroic Democratic Allied Army gave the invaders a heavy, annihilating blow. This 25th Division, known as the Chiang army's elite, equipped entirely with American weapons, suffered over 1,500 casualties, and more than 5,000, including the division commander and deputy commander, were captured alive. We must also point out that the 25th Division was one of Chiang Kai-shek's old investments for waging civil war, the unit by which figures like Guan Linzheng and Du Yuming rose to prominence. The destruction of such a painstakingly built-up elite unit at the hands of the people's army is a heartbreaking loss for the warmongers! But they are stubbornly persisting, continuing to expand the civil war, and their future disasters are only mounting! The 52nd Army, to which the 25th Division belonged, suffered heavy losses in the Battle of Benxi at the end of April this year, with 4,000 casualties, and the army commander Zhao Gongwu barely escaped. This time, in the Kuandian area, an entire division was annihilated, and even the division commander and deputy commander were captured. This shows that the people's righteous punishment is inescapable.
　　The large-scale laying down of arms by officers and soldiers of the 25th Division shows that the Chiang army's elite units largely lack combat effectiveness, and the anti-war sentiment within the Chiang army is growing. Over twenty "thought criminals" soldiers, imprisoned outside the west gate of Kaiyuan for "disobeying orders," were released on the 15th of last month and transferred to the Shen-Ji line for combat, where they all laid down their arms and defected to the Democratic Allied Army. The Chiang army stationed around Changtu is unwilling to even clean their rusted guns, and even a company commander of the Chiang army stationed in Sipingjie, Dou Weishu, committed suicide by poisoning himself on the 14th of last month because his request for retirement was denied. Despite Du Yuming's boast that "the Nationalist army's cold-weather clothing and equipment are far superior to those of the Communist army," the Chiang army in Dashiqiao, a stone's throw from Shenyang, is still wearing single layers, warming themselves by fire, and singing the "Meng Jiangnu Sends Winter Clothes" tune to relieve boredom. How can such a Chiang army, at odds with the people and with demoralized morale, avoid the fate of defeat in the face of the strong self-defense of the military and civilians in the Liberated Areas?
　　The Kuandian campaign fully demonstrates the great strength of the people of Liaodong. On the eve of this campaign, tens of thousands of farmers poured into the Democratic Allied Army, and even more farmers armed themselves and organized militia guerrillas to cooperate with the regular army. Thousands upon thousands of soldiers marched to the front lines amidst the sounds of drums and music and the crowds' cheers. The people of the Liaodong Liberated Area, like the people of the Northeast Liberated Area, have achieved democracy and freedom after shaking off the yoke of Japanese imperialism, especially through the implementation of land reform (each farmer in the Liaodong Liberated Area obtained about three mu of land). They have seen the dark situation in the Chiang-controlled areas of the Northeast, and they are determined not to be subjected to the enslavement of Chiang Kai-shek's rule again. Their unity of purpose, defending their homes, defending their land, and defending democracy and freedom, is invincible.
　　Everyone knows that Chiang Kai-shek is able to wage civil war in the Northeast because of the help of American imperialism. Under the guise of "mediation," the American authorities transported Chiang's troops to the Northeast and supplied them with large quantities of weapons. The Northeast Democratic Allied Army and the people of the Northeast once held great hopes for peace, and they made countless concessions for the sake of peace. However, the Chiang side was insatiably greedy and regarded these concessions as a sign of the people's weakness. They not only tore up the January 10th Truce Agreement, the March 27th and June 7th Northeast Truce Agreements, but also, after reaffirming the Northeast Truce Agreement on September 23rd, the Chiang army tore up this agreement again by occupying Andong City. This fact once again proves that Chiang Kai-shek's "truce" promises are worthless. Genuine peace is impossible without crushing the Chiang army's offensive. The people of the Northeast Liberated Area, like the people of the Liberated Areas within the passes, after thoroughly understanding Chiang and the U.S.'s intention to eliminate China's democratic forces and abandoning any illusions, will be even more wholeheartedly and resolutely resist comprehensively, annihilating the invaders in large numbers, in order to achieve the goal of restoring lost territory and realizing peace.

　　第二十五师的毁灭
    解放日报六日时评
    继关内涟水、保定、和鄄城战役的大捷，又传来了关外民主联军在宽甸桓仁地区歼灭蒋军二十五师全部的捷音。仅仅在十天以前，杜聿明侵占安东，是如何得意忘形地公开表示，要在东北大打。他对合众社记者夸口说：“冬季气候对国军有利，因他们的防寒衣着装备远较中共军为佳”。然而曾几何时，就在离开安东不远的地方——宽甸桓仁地方，英勇的民主联军，即给进犯者以一个沉重的、歼灭性的打击。这个号称蒋军嫡系精锐，全部美机装备的第二十五师，除了一千五百人的伤亡以外，正副师长以下五千余人都被活捉。我们还须指出：第二十五师是蒋介石进行内战的老本之一，是关麟征、杜聿明辈借以发迹的部队。许多年来惨淡经营的一支嫡系部队，一旦毁灭于人民军队之手，这对于好战分子，是如何痛心的损失啊！但是他们一意孤行，继续扩大内战，他们未来的灾难，还正多哩！第二十五师所属之五十二军，曾于今年四月底本溪一役遭受重创，伤亡四千人，军长赵公武侥幸逃脱，此次在宽甸地区整个一师被歼，连正副师长也束手就擒，可见人民的正义惩罚是逃不了的。
    第二十五师大量官兵的放下武器，说明蒋军嫡系部队大部分战斗力不强，蒋军内部厌战情绪日益增长，开原西门外被囚禁有二十余名“不服从命令”的军人思想犯，其中九名于上月十五日出狱，调往沈吉线作战均已放下武器投奔民主联军。驻昌图一带蒋军，不愿擦生了锈的枪，就连驻四平街蒋军的一个连长窦维书，因要求退役未准，也在上月十四日服毒自杀。尽管杜聿明吹嘘“国军防寒衣着装备远较中共军为佳”。距沈阳咫尺的大石桥蒋军，却尚着单衣，烘火取暖，唱着“孟姜女送寒衣”小调遣闷，试问如此与人民为敌，士气不振的蒋军，在解放区军民的坚强自卫面前，怎能避免失败的命运？
    宽甸战役，充分表现辽东人民的伟大力量，在这战役前夕，几万农民涌入了民主联军，更多的农民，自己武装起来，组织了民兵游击队，配合正规军作战。成千成万的子弟兵，在鼓乐喧天，群众簇拥下，出发前线。辽东解放区人民和东北解放区人民一样，在摆脱日寇奴役之后，取得了民主自由，特别是实行了土地改革（辽东解放区每个农民，约获三亩土地）。他们看到了东北蒋管区的黑暗情形，他们决不愿再受蒋介石统治的奴役，他们万众一心，保卫家乡，保卫土地，保卫民主自由的力量，是不可战胜的。
    谁都知道蒋介石之所以能在东北进行内战，是由于美国帝国主义的帮助，美国当局在“调解”的掩护下，运蒋军到东北，供给蒋军大量的武器。而东北民主联军和东北人民，曾对和平抱着极大的希望，他们为了和平曾经作了无数次的让步，但是蒋方贪得无餍，却把这些让步认为是人民的弱点，他们不仅撕毁了一月十日停战协定，三月二十七日与六月七日之东北停战协定，而且在九月二十三日重申东北停战协定之后，蒋军又以侵占安东市来撕毁这一协定。这一事实，又再次证明蒋介石的“停战”诺言，是一钱不值的，不粉碎蒋军的进攻，真正的和平是决不可能的。东北解放区人民和关内解放区人民一样，在彻底了解蒋美消灭中国民主力量的意图并抛弃任何幻想以后，更将一心一意坚决全面抵抗，大量歼灭进犯者，以达到恢复失地，实现和平的目的。
