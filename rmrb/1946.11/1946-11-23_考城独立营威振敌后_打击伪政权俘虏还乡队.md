(Delayed Report from the Jilu豫 Frontline Reporter Group, 19th) The Kao City Independent Battalion, active behind Chiang Kai-shek's lines, fights daily and wins every battle. After the Chiang army invaded the Kao City liberated area, the county and district troops and militia there were immediately reorganized into a mass armed force. Since their establishment, they have been fighting almost every day. Just as they were being reorganized, the enemy in Dafu Village began to attack them. In this battle, along the southwest village of Lilou, they first killed more than fifty invading soldiers. After the first shot was fired, everyone was in high spirits, and from then on, they took the initiative to ambush or attack the invading troops. On September 23, in Wangtang, they killed the invading army's Captain Wang, seized nine rifles, and captured thirteen prisoners. On the 25th, they ambushed Chiang's "Returning Home Corps" in Dazhaiji, killing seven and obtaining several guns. On the 26th, they ambushed the "Returning Home Corps" in Xiaoliuzhai. The enemy ran away as soon as they saw them, and one was killed. Then, in the areas of Yunzhong, Guo Jindou, and Chengzi Village, they scattered the Ma Fengle bandit troops. Originally, Ma Fengle had gathered two to three hundred people to rob things in our central area, but he was attacked halfway before he arrived, and he dared not come out after that. On September 29, more than twenty members of the Baimaoji "Returning Home Corps" ran into our local troops, and all of them were taken prisoner. On October 9, they destroyed Guo Xiaohu's puppet regime. This place was located between Maguan and Taoyuan. The puppet regime was controlled by the special agent bosses Guo Da and Guo Er. They thought it was very safe in this place and did not expect our army to come. In the middle of the night, they broke into Guo Da's house. Guo Da's son was immediately executed, and Guo Da was injured and escaped. Due to their active activities and widespread propaganda, the invading army panicked. When Ma Fengle spoke in Guo Jindou, he also said timidly: "The Kao City Independent Battalion is more powerful than before! Let's go if we run into them, we won't fight!..." After the special agent Guo Da was injured, he hurriedly went to the Sixty-eighth Army for help, but the reply was: "It is equally tense here." The victory of the Kao City Independent Battalion has gradually stabilized the people's emotions, and the enemy's deceptive propaganda has slowly collapsed. Some people said: "The Eighth Route Army has not only not left, but is now fighting even more fiercely!" The prestige of the Lu currency is also increasing day by day. At the beginning, the exchange rate of Lu currency for legal tender was fourteen to ten, but now it is one to four in some places. Some people who were watching the situation have also slowly settled down. They already doubted the "victory" of the "Central Army" and had a common belief in the Eighth Route Army: "The Eighth Route Army will not fail."

　　考城独立营威振敌后
    打击伪政权俘虏还乡队
    【本报冀鲁豫前线记者团十九日电】（迟到）活跃在蒋后方的考城独立营天天战斗每战获捷。蒋军侵占考城解放区后，那里的县区部队及民兵立即编成一支群众武装。自从他们成立以来差不多每天都在战斗，就在他们刚刚整编好的时候，大夫村的敌人便开始向他们进攻。这一仗在李楼西南村沿，首先打死了五十多个进犯军。第一炮打响后，大家情绪甚高，从此便更主动的去伏击或袭击进犯军。九月二十三日，在王堂又打死了进犯军的王队长，缴了九枝步枪，捉了十三个俘虏。廿五日，在大寨集西伏击了蒋家“还乡队”，打死七个，得了几枝枪。二十六日在小刘寨伏击“还乡队”，敌人见面就跑，被打死一个。接着又在运中、郭金斗、程子村一带把马逢乐匪部打的七零八落。本来马逢乐集结的二三百人要到我中心区抢东西，他没有走到，半路就挨了打，从此以后便不敢出来了。九月二十九日，白茅集“还乡队”二十多个人，碰上了我们当地的部队，敌人便全部作了俘虏。十月九日，他们打掉了郭小湖的伪政权。这个地方处于马关与桃园之间，伪政权由特务头子郭大郭二兄弟掌握，他们以为在这地方很保险，没有想到我军会来，半夜里就打开了郭大的家，郭大的儿子立即被处死，郭大受伤逸去。由于他们的积极活动及到处宣传，进犯军发了慌，马逢乐在郭金斗讲话时，也胆虚的说：“考城独立营比从前厉害啦！咱们碰上就走，咱不打！……”特务郭大挂彩后，便连忙向六十八军去求援，但回答是：“这里也同样吃紧”。考城独立营的胜利，使老百姓的情绪渐渐稳定下来，敌人的欺骗宣传也慢慢的垮了台，有的老百姓说：“八路军不仅没有走，现在还打得更凶哩！”鲁钞的威信也一天比一天高，开始鲁钞换法币是十四比十、现在有的地方已一比四。有些张着眼睛看风头的人也慢慢的定下了心。他们已怀疑着“中央军”的“胜利”，对八路军则有一个共同的信念：“八路军不会不行的”。
