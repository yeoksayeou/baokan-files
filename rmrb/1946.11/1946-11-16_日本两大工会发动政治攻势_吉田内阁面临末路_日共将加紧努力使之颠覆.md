Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 13th: Tokyo dispatch: Japan's two major labor unions—the Congress of Industrial Unions of Japan and the Japanese Federation of Labor—have separately decided to oppose the Yoshida government. The Congress of Industrial Unions of Japan has launched a political offensive aimed at overthrowing the Yoshida government. The Central Strike Committee of the Congress issued a statement on the 12th, indicating a shift from the purely economic struggles previously adopted to a new policy of "unhesitatingly putting forward political demands." The committee attacked the Yoshida government for completely neglecting national economic recovery and demanded its resignation. The National Federation of Labor also passed a resolution demanding the dissolution of the parliament and the resignation of the cabinet. Japanese newspapers have described this concerted action by the two major labor unions as "significant" and hinted that the time for the downfall of the Yoshida government is approaching. The Yomiuri Shimbun stated that the scale of the labor unrest in Japan symbolizes the demise of the Yoshida government. The All-Japan Electrical Workers' Union called on the two major labor unions to cooperate on the 12th. The two major labor unions have made the same decision to overthrow the Yoshida cabinet, but they are currently acting independently. The Labor Federation stated on the same day that there is currently no basis for cooperation. Note: The leadership of this labor union is dominated by the right wing of the Socialist Party, while the Congress of Industrial Unions of Japan is led by the Japanese Communist Party and other left-wing members of the Socialist Party.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 13th: Tokyo dispatch: Japanese Communist Party spokesman Ito stated at a press conference on the 12th that the Communist Party will intensify its efforts to overthrow the Yoshida cabinet, through cooperation with labor and the Social Democratic Party. Ito also stated that the Communist Party intends to suggest to the Social Democratic Party that "government-appointed bureaucrats" should be replaced by representatives of various political parties, and that measures should be taken to prevent undesirable personnel from holding public office. The Communist Party advocates that the government succeeding Yoshida should obey the will of the people. Social Democratic Party Secretary-General Nishio (right-wing) told reporters on the same day that the party will continue to demand the dissolution of the current parliament. However, he also stated that the party does not intend to engage in any activities to overthrow the Yoshida cabinet and expressed that it does not intend to cooperate with the Japanese Communist Party.

    日本两大工会发动政治攻势
    吉田内阁面临末路
    日共将加紧努力使之颠覆
    【新华社延安十三日电】东京讯：日本两大工会——产业工会联合会及劳工联合会，已分别决定反对吉田政府。产业工会联合会已发动了旨在推翻吉田政府的政治攻势，该会中央罢工委员会十二日发表声明，表示改变前此所采取的纯经济斗争，进而采取“毫不犹豫地提出政治要求”的新政策。该委员会攻击吉田政府完全忽视全国经济恢复，并要求其辞职。全国劳工联合会亦通过决议，要求解散议会及内阁辞职。日本各报对此二大工会采取一致行动，称之为“意义重大”，并暗示吉田政府倒台的时机已将近成熟。读卖新闻称：日本工潮的浩大，象征着吉田政府的末路。全日电气工人联合会于十二日呼吁两大工会合作，该两大工会并已采取同样的打倒吉田内阁的决定，但目前仍各自为政。劳工联合会于同日声称：目前无合作之基础可言。按：该工会领导社会党右派占优势，而产业工会联合会则为日共及其他社会党左翼人士所领导。
    【新华社延安十三日电】东京讯：日本共产党发言人伊藤于十二日记者招待会上称：共产党将加紧颠覆吉田内阁之努力，方法是与劳工及社会民主党合作。伊藤又称：共产党拟向社会民主党建议，应以各政党代表代替“由政府指派的官僚”，并采取措施防止不良人员负担任公职。共产党主张承继吉田之政府应服从全民意志。社会民主党总书记西尾（右派）于同日招待记者称：该党将继续要求解散现行议会。但又称：该党不拟从事任何活动以颠覆吉田内阁，并表示不拟与日共合作。
