　　Welcome Mrs. Cripps to Yan'an
    *Liberation Daily* Editorial, 29th
    Mrs. Cripps, Chairwoman of the British United Aid to China Fund, arrived in Yan'an by special plane yesterday. We extend a warm welcome to this friend of the Chinese people. For several years, under the call and leadership of the British United Aid to China Fund, the British people, despite their own suffering from the war, have continuously provided encouragement and support to the Chinese people in their war of resistance, and have eagerly hoped that China would become an independent, democratic, and free country. They have also given fair and friendly assistance to the War of Resistance and democratic construction of the Chinese Liberated Areas. The Chinese people, especially the people of the Liberated Areas, will never forget this and express their heartfelt gratitude.
    Unfortunately, since the end of the global anti-fascist war, the US authorities have violated the spirit of previous international agreements, especially the Moscow Three-Power Agreement on China and their own solemn promises, and have supported the fascist dictatorship government in wantonly expanding the civil war, attempting to turn China into an exclusive colony of American imperialism and making China a battlefield for a third world war. This perverse behavior by American and Chinese reactionaries completely violates the will of the people who desire peace and democracy. The Chinese people, especially the soldiers and civilians in the liberated areas, have been tempered by the eight-year War of Resistance, and their unity and awakening have reached an unprecedented level. They have full confidence and sufficient strength to crush the reactionaries' offensive under any difficult conditions. We firmly believe that the current arduous but inevitably victorious struggle of the Chinese people is a severe blow to the reactionaries in the world and in China. It will not only ultimately win China's independence, peace, and democracy, but will also greatly promote global democracy and lasting peace. Therefore, the Chinese people, the British people, and the people of all other countries still stand on the same front today, waging a resolute struggle against the reactionary forces that suppress democracy and endanger peace.
    We deeply cherish the great traditional friendship between the Chinese and British nations and are willing to continue to strive to further enhance this friendship. We sincerely hope that Mrs. Cripps's visit to Yan'an will lead to a clearer understanding of the true face of the new China, greatly promote the continued development and consolidation of Sino-British friendship, and powerfully advance the joint efforts of the Chinese and British nations for the cause of world democracy and peace.

　　欢迎克利浦斯夫人来延
    解放日报廿九日社论
    英国援华总会主席克利浦斯夫人于昨日专机抵延，我们敬向这位中国人民的友人表示热烈的欢迎。几年以来，英国人民在援华总会的号召与主持之下，尽管他们自身也在遭受战争的苦难，对抗战中的中国人民还不断给以鼓舞和支援，热望中国成为独立民主自由的国家。对于中国解放区军民的抗战与民主建设，也给以公正友好的帮助。这在中国人民，尤其解放区人民，将永志不忘，并表示衷心的感谢。
    所不幸的，自全世界反法西斯战争胜利结束以后，美国当局违背了历次的国际协议的精神，特别是莫斯科三国协定关于中国问题的决定和自己历次的庄严诺言，支持法西斯独裁政府恣意扩大内战，妄图使中国沦为美帝国主义独占的殖民地，使中国成为第三次大战的战场。美国反动派和中国反动派的这种倒行逆施，完全违反和平民主人民的意志。中国人民，尤其解放区军民，经过八年抗战的锻炼，团结与觉醒程度已空前提高，已有充分的信心和足够的力量在任何困难的条件下粉碎反动派的进攻。我们深信中国人民目前艰苦的但是必然胜利的斗争，是对世界和中国反动派的严重打击。它不仅将最后赢得中国的独立和平与民主，也将大大促进全世界民主的与持久的和平。因此，中国人民和英国人民以及一切其他国家的人民，今天依然站在同一条战线上，向着压抑民主、危害和平的反动势力作坚决的斗争。
    我们十分珍重中英两大民族传统的伟大友谊，并愿为更加增进这种友谊而继续奋斗。我们衷心地希望克利浦斯夫人此次来延，将更加清楚地了解新中国的真面目，将大大促进中英友谊的继续发展与巩固，并将有力的推进中英两大民族为世界民主和平事业而作共同努力。
