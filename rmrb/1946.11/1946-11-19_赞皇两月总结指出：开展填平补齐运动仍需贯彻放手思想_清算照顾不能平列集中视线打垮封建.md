[Report from this newspaper] Zanhhuang's summary of the two-month mass movement reveals that in the in-depth stage following the peak of the movement, resolving the issue of "letting go" is even more crucial. Specific examination reveals the following ideological obstacles: (1) The "good enough" mentality, which is a complacent mood among leading cadres. This is a widespread problem from top to bottom, affecting most cadres from the county to the village level. The "good enough" mentality takes various forms. After several struggles by the masses, some cadres develop a sense of pity for landlords, leading them to say it's "good enough." Cadres from wealthy middle-peasant backgrounds, fearing that thorough struggle against landlords might lead to struggle against themselves, are unwilling to fight thoroughly and also say it's "good enough." At this time, the leadership's understanding of the situation is not concrete, especially their understanding of the opinions of the most oppressed and exploited masses. After hearing one-sided reports, they lack sufficient understanding of the arduousness and complexity of thoroughly eliminating feudalism, leading to complacency and wavering. (2) Unclear views on "letting go" to whom and who should eliminate feudalism. There is only a general statement about mobilizing the basic masses, without truly understanding that poor and lower-middle peasants should be the backbone, uniting with middle peasants to eliminate feudalism. In some villages, the opinions of poor and lower-middle peasants are even ignored when gathering the opinions of the majority, following a middle-peasant line. Therefore, there is confusion about who should be the primary force in mobilization, neglecting the liberation of the most impoverished and suffering masses.
    (3) Equating clearing accounts with providing assistance, lacking a clear direction to prioritize clearing accounts to thoroughly eliminate feudalism. In many villages, assistance is not provided after struggle, but struggle and assistance are proposed simultaneously, greatly increasing the masses' concerns and fear of violating policy, hindering their active participation. Feudal landlords seize the opportunity to emphasize: "Anyway, the Eighth Route Army won't let anyone starve to death, you can take more or less." In many villages, they only consider the landlords, leaving good land for cultivation and livestock, seriously affecting the thorough implementation of the policy of eliminating feudalism. (4) Equating eliminating feudalism with resolving relations between cadres and the masses, affecting the concentration of attention on the struggle. Especially some comrades lack sufficient understanding of eliminating feudalism, and when encountering cadre problems, they immediately try to resolve cadre problems, failing to guide the masses' target towards anti-feudalism, only getting entangled in the relationship between cadres and the masses,打击了干部的积极情绪，甚至特务钻空和地主反攻。打击了干部的积极情绪，甚至让特务钻空和地主反攻。打击了干部的积极情绪，甚至让特务钻空和地主反攻. (5) Fear of excess and people running away. This is mainly due to historical influences, deeply fearing that the masses will fight too hard, the targets will run away, and superiors will criticize them, leading to some incomplete phenomena of peaceful accounting, little complaining, and no struggle. (6) The burden of historical experience and "uncooked rice" thinking affects bold "letting go." For example, before autumn, the whole county's masses demanded quick struggle followed by autumn harvesting and wheat sowing, but the leadership feared making "uncooked rice" (problems solved but the masses not mobilized), so in most areas, this demand and action of the masses was not implemented and improved (in some areas it was good). The masses demanded struggle in batches, but the leadership feared doing it poorly and struggled one by one. The masses demanded immediate struggle, but the cadres said no, it must be brewed for a few days. The masses said: if you don't come, we'll fight; if you come, you'll sit in "court." This formed a pattern of paternalistic control.

    赞皇两月总结指出：开展填平补齐运动仍需贯彻放手思想
    清算照顾不能平列集中视线打垮封建
    【本报讯】赞皇总结两月群运，发现在运动高潮过后的深入阶段中，解决放手思想关系更为重要，具体检查，主要是有以下几种思想障碍：（一）“差不多”思想，即领导干部的自满情绪。这是从上而下，由县到村大部干部的一个普遍思想问题。“差不多”思想是各色各样的；当群众经过几次斗争，个别干部就产生怜悯地主思想，因而说“差不多”了。富裕中农的干部，怕斗光地主斗自己，不愿彻底斗，也说“差不多”了。这时领导上了解情况不具体，特别不了解最受压迫剥削群众的意见，在听了片面反映后，对彻底消灭封建艰苦性复杂性的认识不足，而发生自满亦是动摇情绪。（二）放手放给谁？及谁来消灭封建的观点不明确，只是一般的说发动基本群众，而未实际体会应以贫雇农为骨干和中农一齐起来消灭封建，甚至有的村在集中大多数人的意见时对贫雇农意见忽视，走了中农路线。所以发动什么人为主是糊涂的。忽视最底层的贫群苦众的翻身。
    （三）清算与照顾平列起来，对清算为主以彻底消灭封建的方针不明确。好多村不是在斗争后再照顾，而是斗争与照顾同时提，大大增加了群众的顾虑，怕违犯政策而不大动。封建地主就乘机强调：“反正八路军不让饿死一个人，你们多拿多留，少拿少留。”有不少村，只替地主打算，留下好养种的地，还留下牲口等，严重影响着彻底消灭封建方针的贯彻。（四）消灭封建和解决干部与群众关系平列起来，影响了斗争视线的集中。尤其有些同志对消灭封建认识不足，而遇到干部问题即解决干部问题，没将群众目标引上反封建，只纠缠在干部与群众的关系上，打击了干部的积极情绪，甚至特务钻空和地主反攻。（五）怕过火怕跑人。主要是历史上的影响，深怕群众起来斗的狠了，对象跑了上级批评，因而产生了一些和平算账，少诉苦不斗争的不彻底现象。（六）历史上经验主义和“生米饭”思想的包袱，影响着大胆放手。如秋前全县群众要求快斗后要收秋种麦，但领导上怕做下“生米饭”（问题解决了群众没发动起来），所以在大部地区未贯彻执行与提高群众这一要求与行动（有一些地区好）。群众要求一批一批斗，领导上怕斗不好，而一个一个斗。群众要求马上斗，干部说不行，还得酝酿几天。群众说：你们不来我们斗，你们来了坐“朝廷”。形成了包办代替。
