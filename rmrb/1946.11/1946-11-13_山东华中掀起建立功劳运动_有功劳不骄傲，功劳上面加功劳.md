Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th. In the midst of smashing Chiang Kai-shek's offensive and striving for victory in the overall resistance, Shandong and Central China have launched a movement to establish merits for the people. The Shandong People's Armed Self-Defense Committee and the Shandong Military Region People's Armed Forces Department issued instructions on "Developing a Merit-Making Movement" in late last month, calling on the broad masses and militia to establish merits in the self-defense war. Militia heroes should master shooting and blasting techniques, abide by mass discipline, and take the lead in making contributions and setting an example. A certain regiment of the 1st Division of the New Fourth Army in Central China is carrying out a "Merit Movement" under slogans such as "Reward Merits, Evaluate Merits, and Award Merits," "Don't be Arrogant with Merits, Add More Merits on Top of Merits," and "Everyone Respects the People's Heroes." Companies have "Merit Books" to record the deeds of heroes and models. For example, when a soldier in a certain company captured four guns in battle, the instructor recorded it in the merit book. In the upsurge of the merit movement, a KMT soldier who recently joined the New Fourth Army after being liberated said: "The New Fourth Army is truly clear about rewards and punishments. In the Kuomintang army, victory belongs to the officers, and the little soldiers have no merits!" Another veteran said: "In the past, the hero and model movement required fighting well, capturing guns, and capturing prisoners to become a hero and model. Now, in this movement, even ordinary marching, doing construction work, uniting with friends, and abiding by discipline can be listed as merits. This method is very good."

    山东华中掀起建立功劳运动
    “有功劳不骄傲，功劳上面加功劳”
    【新华社延安十日电】在粉碎蒋介石的进攻，争取全面抵抗胜利的声中，山东及华中展开为人民建立功劳运动。山东人民武装自卫委员会及山东军区人民武装部，于上月下旬颁发“开展立功运动”的指示，号召广大群众及民兵在自卫战中建立功劳，民兵英雄更应掌握射击与爆炸技术，遵守群众纪律，带头立功，做出榜样。华中新四军一师某团，则正在“有功报功论功行赏”“有了功劳不骄傲，功劳上面加功劳”“人民功臣个个尊敬”等口号下开展“功劳运动”，连队里订有“功劳簿”把英雄模范的事迹记载入簿；如某连一战士在战斗中缴了四支枪，指导员便将其记入功劳簿。在功劳运动热潮中，一个新近解放后参加新四军的蒋军士兵说：“新四军真是赏罚分明，国民党军队里打了胜仗是长官的，小兵有什么功劳”！另一位老战士说：“过去英雄模范运动要打仗好，缴到枪，抓到俘虏，才能作到英雄模范，现在这个运动，平时行军，做工事，团结友爱好，执行纪律好，也都可以列为功劳，这个办法好得很”。
