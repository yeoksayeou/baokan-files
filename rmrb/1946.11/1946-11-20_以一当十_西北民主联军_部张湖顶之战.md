    One Against Ten
    The Battle of Zhanghuding by the Northwest Democratic Allied Army Unit ×
    Xiǎo Duó

    (I)
    A mountain ridge spanning the southern bank of the Zhanghe River, like a long sword, directly pierces the heart of the reactionaries in Anyang City. The villages along the southeastern edge of the ridge are Zhanghuding, Shenjiadong, and Shangbaishu. Fifty miles northwest of Zhanghuding, along this mountain ridge, lies one of the rich coal mining areas of North China, Liuhegou. Thus, Zhanghuding became the gateway to Liuhegou.

    The reactionaries had long plotted to seize the Liuhegou coal mining area. In mid-October, the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops in Anyang City, while clamoring to invade Shuiye and Zhanghuding, transferred troops from various parts of northern Henan. Finally, they cobbled together parts of the 40th and 85th Divisions, along with the puppet troops of Wang Ziquan, the puppet "Homecoming Corps," totaling about six regiments, and actively deployed for the invasion.

    The Northwest People's Liberation Army soldiers guarding Zhanghuding had long seen through this conspiracy of Chiang Kai-shek's puppets and actively prepared for battle. Comrades fully understood the importance of defending Zhanghuding and had full confidence in victory, putting forward the slogan: "Resolutely defend Zhanghuding with our blood!"

    (II)
    At seven o'clock in the morning on October 24th, in addition to the invasion of Shuiye, the enemy launched a full-scale attack on Zhanghuding with two regiments in coordination with the puppet troops of Wang Ziquan. Four field guns continuously bombarded our positions, and four aircraft took turns strafing. However, our soldiers remained very calm and composed. "Annihilate the attacking enemy in front of our positions!" became everyone's belief. When the enemy shelled us, Zhu Ruixing, the deputy squad leader of the Fifth Company of the × Regiment, was suffering from malaria, shivering and feverish, but he refused to leave his position for even a step. When the enemy, under the cover of aircraft and artillery, rushed to the front of our positions, the soldiers used a crossfire network to shoot at the enemy. Yan Jucai, the deputy squad leader of the Fourth Company of the × Regiment, although wounded, resolutely refused to leave the line of fire. The position of a squad from the Second Company was temporarily withdrawn due to a machine gun malfunction. Lian Chang, of the party, immediately took a squad to counterattack the enemy and restore the position, fully demonstrating the fighting spirit of new heroism and shattering the enemy's first charge.

    (III)
    After twelve o'clock noon, the enemy launched a second charge with two companies. Two squads from the First and Second Companies of our × Regiment坚守were坚守the positions. When the enemy attacked the position of the Third Battalion of the × Regiment, the hand-mortar of Company Commander Wang of the Seventh Company, after the enemy entered the effective range, the first shell hit the enemy's nest. Seeing the enemy falling one after another, coupled with the fierce flanking fire of our Eighth and Ninth Companies, the enemy suffered even more casualties and retreated in a very embarrassed state!

    Pan Jinru, the mortar company commander of the × Regiment, fired his artillery very accurately. Seeing that a mound near Dongbiaodian Village, 1,500 meters away, had been occupied by the enemy, with a flag planted on top, threatening our First Battalion and the regimental headquarters, he was so angry that his eyes were blazing. After aiming at the target, he added five propellant charges to the shell and fired six shots in a row, each hitting the enemy. The enemy and the flag disappeared in the rising smoke and dust.

    Comrade Ming Tao, the deputy battalion commander of the First Battalion of the × Regiment, personally led the charge with a machine gun, and the soldiers swarmed after him. The Sixth Company fought the enemy repeatedly six times to seize a position, and finally regained the position. The enemy's second charge was crushed by this group of heroic and tenacious soldiers!

    (IV)
    The enemy's second fierce attack failed, and they launched a third attack at four o'clock in the afternoon. This time, they were attempting to outflank Zhanghuding from Shangbaishu on the right flank of the position, with a force of more than three hundred. The artillery bombarded incessantly, and the aircraft strafed. More than twenty soldiers from the First Company of the × Regiment, in coordination with a mortar squad, calmly repelled the enemy. The enemy seemed somewhat unconvinced, but the infantry dared not attack again, and although the artillery continued to roar, not a single shell hit our position.

    At dusk, the enemy gathered civilians near Xiaotun to build fortifications to prevent our counterattack at night. After the sentry discovered this, Platoon Leader Chen of the artillery company took a gun and fired five shots, each hitting the target, and the enemy's fortifications could not be built.

    (V)
    After a whole day of fierce fighting on the Zhanghuding line, the enemy fired more than 500 shells, and the number of aircraft strafing runs was uncountable. The open space south of Zhanghuding Village was scorched by artillery fire, and shattered shell casings were visible everywhere. Our position, however, remained unshaken. All the enemy gained was more than two hundred casualties. The ratio of enemy to our casualties was ten to one.

    以一当十
    西北民主联军×部张湖顶之战
    晓铎
    （一）
    横亘在漳河南岸的一条山梁，好像一把长剑似的，正南直刺向安阳城反动派的心脏。山梁东南边沿上的几个村庄是张湖顶、申家洞、上柏树。沿着这条山梁在张湖顶西北五十里之地，就是华北丰富的煤矿区之一的六河沟，因此张湖顶成了六河沟的门户。
    反动派企图占领六河沟煤矿区，蓄谋已久。十月中旬，安阳城蒋伪军一面扬言要进犯水冶、张湖顶，一面从豫北各地抽调兵力，最后是东拉西凑到四十师、八五师各一部加上，伪军王自全，伪“还乡团”等共约六个团的兵力，积极部署进犯。
    守卫张湖顶的西北人民子弟兵，早就看出了蒋伪这一阴谋，积极准备战斗；同志们都充分的了解到保卫张湖顶的重要意义；都具有胜利的信心，提出了口号：“用热血坚决保卫张湖顶！”
    （二）
    十月二十四日早晨七点钟，敌人除向水冶进犯外，另以两个团配合伪军王自全部，向我张湖顶全线进攻。四门野炮连续向我阵地猛轰，四架飞机轮番扫射；但我们战士们，却非常镇定沉着，“把进攻敌人消灭在阵地前面！”成为大家的信念。当敌人炮轰时，×团五连副班长朱瑞兴正发疟疾，发冷又发热，可是他不肯离开阵地一步。当敌人在飞机大炮掩护下，冲上阵地前沿时，战士们用交叉火网射击敌人。×团四连副班长阎举才虽负了伤，坚决不下火线，二连一个班的阵地因机枪发生故障暂时撤了；党中材连长马上自动带了一个班反击敌人，恢复了阵地，充分发挥了新英雄主义的战斗精神，粉碎了敌人第一次的冲锋。
    （三）
    上午十二点以后，敌人以两连兵力开始了第二次冲锋。我×团一二两连的两个班，坚守着阵地。敌人向×团三营阵地进攻时，七连王连长的手迫击，在敌人进入有效射程以后，头一炮弹就打到敌人窝里，眼看着敌人纷纷倒下，加上我八九连以炽烈的火力侧射，敌人死伤更多，非常狼狈的退下去了！
    ×团迫炮连长潘金如的炮打得挺准，看到一千五百公尺外东彪店村附近的土包被敌人占了，上面还插有一面旗子，威胁我一营和团指挥所，他愤怒得眼里冒火，瞄准目标后，给炮弹上加了五个药包，一连打了六炮，炮炮落到敌人中间，敌人和旗子都在腾起的硝烟与尘土中消失了。
    ×团一营副营长明涛同志，亲自提了机枪冲在前头，战士们也蜂拥的跟着冲上去。六连为争夺一个阵地，和敌人反复冲杀了六次，最后夺回了阵地。二次冲锋的敌人，被这群英勇顽强的战士们打垮了！
    （四）
    敌人二次猛扑不逞，下午四时又发动第三次进攻。这回是从阵地右翼上柏树方面迂回张湖顶的，兵力在三百以上，炮不停歇的轰击，飞机俯冲扫射，×团一连二十余名战士协同迫击炮一班，沉着的击退了敌人，敌人似乎有些不服气，但步兵不敢再攻上来，炮虽不断在狂吼，却没一炮打中我们阵地。
    黄昏了，敌人在小屯附近集结民夫筑工事，以防我们晚上反击；哨兵发现后，炮连陈排长带了一门炮上去，连打五炮，炮炮命中，敌人工事也无法筑成。
    （五）
    在张湖顶一线整整激战了一天，敌人的炮弹足足打了五百发以上，飞机扫射次数无法计算，张湖顶村南的空地被炮弹打成一片焦土，爆裂的弹皮随处可见；我们的阵地却屹然未动。敌人所得到的祗是二百名以上的伤亡，敌我伤亡比例是十比一。
