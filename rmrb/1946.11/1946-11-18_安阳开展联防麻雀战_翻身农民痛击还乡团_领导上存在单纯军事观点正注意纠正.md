    【This Dispatch from Our Newspaper in An'yang】October was the month when the militia here fought most fiercely with the "Returning Landlord Corps." The sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth districts were fighting the enemy every day, and the fourth and tenth districts were engaged in close combat day and night. According to incomplete statistics, there were 68 battles of various sizes, killing and wounding more than 150 enemies, capturing more than a dozen alive, cutting 70 catties of telegraph wire, and intercepting more than 60 laborers, 9 livestock, and some guns, clothing, and other items. Our militia suffered only 8 casualties. The achievement of this victory is due, first, to the emergence of many heroes and model figures in the New Heroism Movement, with many peasants who had been liberated becoming heroes in killing the enemy. For example, the director of the Hongyan Farmers' Association led more than a dozen militiamen, appearing around Qugou every day, and he himself killed two enemies. Second, the organized cooperation of the joint defense militia, such as the joint militia of the East and West Shi villages, repelled the attack of more than 100 enemies. Third, the development of guerrilla warfare with cold shots; in the Nanling area, two or three enemies were killed or wounded every day. Similarly, three main reasons were found for failing to eliminate more enemies: (1) Errors in tactical guidance. Some militia leaders, eager to achieve success, used the militia as regular troops, fighting head-on, which, while killing and wounding the enemy, also damaged the morale of the militia. (2) Only knowing how to fight military battles, not knowing how to fight political battles. The fourth and tenth districts, located on the border and behind enemy lines, often faced enemy villages, providing the best conditions for disintegrating the enemy. However, due to insufficient attention to the work of winning over and disintegrating the enemy, a phenomenon of mutual scolding with the enemy has formed. These shortcomings have attracted the attention of the local leadership and are being actively improved.

    安阳开展联防麻雀战
    翻身农民痛击还乡团
    领导上存在单纯军事观点正注意纠正
    【本报安阳讯】十月份是此间民兵与“还乡团”斗争最激烈的一个月。六、七、八、九区，没有一天不在与敌人作战，四、十区，更是昼夜短兵相接。据不完全统计，大小战斗六十八次，毙伤敌百五十余人，生擒十多个，割电线七十斤，并截下民夫六十余人，牲口九条，及枪支衣物一部。我民兵仅伤亡八人。这一胜利的取得，第一，在新英雄主义运动中涌现了不少的杀敌英雄与模范人物，许多翻身英雄又成为杀敌英雄。如洪岩农会主任领着十多个民兵，每日出没于曲沟附近，光他自己就打死了两个敌人。第二，联防民兵有机的配合，如东西石村民兵联合击退了百多敌人的进攻。第三，麻雀冷枪战的开展，在南岭区，每天总要打死或打伤三两个敌人。同样，也发现了未能消灭更多敌人的三个主要原因：（一）战术指导上的错误。有些民兵领导者，急于求功，把民兵作正规军使用，硬顶硬碰，虽杀伤了敌人，却也损伤了民兵的情绪。（二）只懂得打军事仗，不懂得打政治仗。四、十两区，处于边沿与敌后，常与敌村对峙，有瓦解敌人的最好条件。但因对争取瓦解敌军工作重视不够，而形成与敌方相互对骂现象。这些缺点，已引起当地领导上注意，并正在积极的改进中。
