Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 24th: On the northern front of Su皖, the New Fourth Army annihilated another battalion of the Gui系 Chiang army’s Seventh Army on the 22nd and shot down a B-24 heavy bomber. One battalion, the 512th Regiment of the 171st Division of that army, surrounded in Songji and other places north of Tangji (northwest of Huaiyin), was annihilated by the New Fourth Army on the evening of the 22nd. In addition to those killed and wounded, more than 200 people, including the battalion commander and deputy battalion commander, were captured alive. In addition, two flat-firing guns, more than ten heavy machine guns, more than one hundred rifles, and many military supplies were seized. On the morning of the same day, two regiments, the 515th and 516th of the 172nd Division of that army, advanced north from Wangying and Lai'an, more than ten miles northwest of Huaiyin, to Dingji and Baji, attempting to relieve the siege of Tangji. They were intercepted by the New Fourth Army on separate routes. At noon on the same day, when two U.S.-made Flying Fortresses and three B-24 heavy bombers indiscriminately bombed the New Fourth Army positions on both sides of the Baojia River, one B-24 was hit and crashed between the two sides' positions north of Tangji.
