　　The Banner of the People's Struggle in the Jiang Army-Occupied Areas

　　Comrade Yang Juhe, who led the militia and working teams to win victories in battles against the Jiang and puppet troops near Jiaozuo, was gloriously wounded in the battle to pursue the enemy. We extend our warm greetings and high respect to the hero of the people's struggle in the Jiang army-occupied areas! Since the first day the Jiang army occupied Jiaozuo, Yang Juhe's militia and working team have been active behind the Jiang army lines, continuously achieving multiple victories by using various methods such as explosions, sniping, and surprise attacks. They are a banner of the people's struggle in the Jiang army-occupied areas, bringing the people a belief in victory and hope.

　　Why were Yang Juhe's militia and working team able to achieve so many victories in such a short period? The reason is simple: it is because they represent the interests of the people, and they have an inseparable connection with the people. The areas occupied by the Jiang army have brought endless tyranny to the people. Traitorous landlords return home and run rampant, restoring traitorous puppet regimes, conscripting soldiers, seizing grain, and building碉堡 [fortified bunkers]... plunging the people into deep water and scorching fire. Like Yang Juhe's militia and working team, they grew out of the people and protected the people's interests after their liberation. Therefore, the people support them, and they can continuously obtain opportunities to take the initiative in annihilating the enemy. The same experience is also proven in Li Yuhua's militia and working team: because they are organized by the local people themselves, they understand the pain and demands of the local people very closely. From the beginning, they used courageous and alert actions to strike at Yan's and the puppet troops' rampant grain grabbing and protect the masses' wheat harvest. Later, they went deep into the masses in the Yan-occupied areas to understand the pain of the Yan and puppet soldiers and won them over through their families. Seven Yan and puppet soldiers have already come over to the people's side with machine guns, rifles, and grenade launchers. These are all powerful blows to Jiang and Yan's conspiracies of seizing grain and conscripting soldiers.

　　We call on the broad masses of people in the Jiang and Yan-occupied areas to learn from the example of Yang Juhe and Li Yuhua's militia and working teams, establish more militia and working teams, strike at the tyranny of Jiang and Yan behind enemy lines, protect the interests of the people, and cooperate with the regular army to send the Jiang and Yan reactionaries to their graves.

　　蒋军侵占区人民斗争的旗帜
    领导民兵武工队在焦作附近连战蒋伪获捷的杨聚和同志，在追击敌人的战斗中光荣负伤，我们谨向蒋军侵占区人民斗争的英雄致热烈的慰问与崇高的敬意！杨聚和民兵武工队从蒋军侵占焦作第一天起，就活跃在蒋军后方，以爆炸、冷枪、飞行袭敌等各种方法连续取得多次胜利，他们是蒋军侵占区人民一面斗争的旗帜，带给了人民以胜利信念与希望。
    杨聚和的民兵武工队在短短的时间内为什么能取得这么多的胜利呢？道理很简单，就是因为他们代表了人民的利益，他们与人民有血肉不可分离的连系。蒋军侵陷的地区，给人民带来了无穷的暴政，奸霸回乡横行，恢复奸伪政权、抓丁、抢粮、修碉堡………使人民陷于水深火热中。像杨聚和民兵武工队这样，从人民中生长起来，保护了人民的翻身利益，因之，人民才拥护他们，他们才能不断取得主动歼敌的机会。同样的经验在李雨化的民兵武工队里也证明着：由于他们是当地人民自己组织起来的，因此他们对于当地人民的痛苦和要求，了解得十分亲切，他们在一开头便以神勇机警的动作，打击了阎伪抢粮的凶焰，保护了群众的麦收，以后更深入到阎占区群众中，了解阎伪军士兵痛苦，通过其家属争取他们回头，已有七个阎伪军士兵携带机枪步枪掷弹筒，到了人民方面来。这些都是对于蒋阎抢粮抓丁阴谋的有力打击。
    我们号召蒋阎侵占区广大人民，学习杨聚和、李雨化民兵武工队的榜样，建立更多的民兵武工队，在敌后打击蒋阎暴政，保护人民利益，配合正规军把蒋阎反动派送进坟墓。
