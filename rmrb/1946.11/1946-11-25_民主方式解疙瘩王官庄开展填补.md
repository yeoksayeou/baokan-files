　　【Benbao Weixian 22nd Telegram】In order to concentrate efforts on struggling against local bullies and landlords, and to carry out the Tianbu (filling in the gaps) movement, the masses of Wangguanzhuang in Qinghe enhanced internal unity among the peasants by using democratic methods to resolve problems. The village has more than 700 households with more than 2,400 people. The peasant association, women's association, and militia have a total of 340 people, and 40 people work as laborers in other villages. Last winter and this spring, rent reduction, interest rate reduction, and democratic movements were carried out, recovering 1.2 million yuan and more than 60 mu of land. When distributing the fruits of the struggle, the land price was set particularly high, resulting in no one wanting the land, and most of the land was sold to other villages. In terms of material distribution, many loose ends were left uncleared, and the distribution was also unfair. Active elements and hired laborers gained a lot, creating a rift between the workers and the peasant association. The masses discussed among themselves: "It is the workers who are turning over, not us." Taking advantage of this opportunity, feudal landlords spent 20,000 yuan to bribe the union chairman, Sun Liting, and more than ten other cadres, causing them to no longer care whether the masses turned over or not. In April and May of this year, the chairman of the peasant association led the demolition of a temple, selling it for hundreds of thousands of yuan, but the money was not distributed to the masses in a timely manner. Some even sold bricks and wood privately, using the funds for personal business. In order to thoroughly solve the land problem of the masses, the leadership recently first sought to resolve the outstanding cases in the village. A village cadre meeting was held, and in-depth education was conducted, explaining that cadres must humbly confess their mistakes to the masses and correct their errors in order to gain the trust of the masses. At the same time, it was decided to resolve these outstanding cases from the proceeds of the struggle. Afterwards, a joint meeting of group leaders of various organizations was held for research. Then, a congress of workers, peasants, and women was convened, announcing the clearing of the fruits of struggle, promoting democracy, inspecting the leadership, and encouraging people to raise any questions. At the meeting, cadres universally conducted self-criticism, confessed their mistakes, and swore an oath to the masses: to guarantee that they would not commit these mistakes in the future, and if they did, everyone could deal with them as they pleased! The masses were also very excited and said: "This is not just one side's fault, it is also because the landlord played tricks; a family should not be disunited. If the brothers have made mistakes, it is over once they have confessed." From then on, the enthusiasm of the masses rose, and the enthusiasm of the cadres also rose. Only the new chairman of the peasant association, Liu Jingyang, dared not confess, and the masses were dissatisfied with him. Then, after three more meetings, the masses and cadres helped him to reflect, but he was still not enlightened. Therefore, according to everyone's opinion, he was replaced and then slowly educated. On this basis, the Tianbu movement was vigorously launched.

　　民主方式解疙瘩王官庄开展填补
    【本报威县二十二日电】为集中力量向恶霸地主进行斗争，开展填平补齐运动，清河王官庄群众以民主解疙瘩方式增强了农民内部团结。该村七百多户，二千四百多人，农会、妇会、民兵共有三百四十人，在外村扛活的有四十人。去冬今春进行减租增资及民主运动，收回一百二十万元、六十多亩地。分果实时，地价定的特别高，结果没人要地，大部分土地卖到外村。在物资分配上，也拉下许多尾巴没有清理，分的也不公平。积极分子与雇工得的很多，工农会产生隔阂。群众纷纷议论：“翻身的是工人，不是我们。”封建地主乘机以两万块钱收买了工会主任孙立廷等十多个干部，使他们不再管群众翻身不翻身。今年四五月，农会主任领导拆庙，卖了几十万元，也未及时分给群众；有的私卖砖木，用款作私人买卖。为了彻底解决群众的土地问题，最近领导上首先设法解决该村的悬案。开了一个村干部会，进行了深入的教育，说明要对群众虚心的坦白错误，改正错误，才能受到群众的信任。同时决定从清算果实中解决这些悬案。以后又召开各组织小组长联席会作了研究。随即召开工农妇大会，宣布清理果实，发扬民主，检查领导，有啥提啥。会上，干部普遍进行自我检讨，坦白了自己的错误，并向群众宣誓：保证今后不犯这些错误，如果犯了，大家随便处理！群众也都很兴奋的说：“这个不光是一方面的错，也怨地主玩手腕；一家人不应该闹不团结。弟兄们有错，说了就算完事。”从此，群众情绪高涨起来，干部情绪也高涨起来。只有新农会主任刘景阳不敢坦白，群众对他不满，接着又经过三次会议，群众干部帮助他要他反省，他还是不觉悟、于是根据大家意见，撤换后再慢慢教育、在这样基础上，填补运动才热烈展开。
