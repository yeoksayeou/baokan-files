Xinhua News Agency, Northeast China, 13th: Village elections have already begun in areas of Northeast China where land reform has been completed. When Xin Nong Village in Zhaozhou County, Songjiang Province, was preparing to elect the village head, village committee members, and the heads of the nine subordinate villages' farmers' associations, the preparatory committee members were busy without a moment's rest. On the morning of the election day, all the villagers from the nine villages turned out. The streets were bustling as if it were a temple fair festival. The election results showed that all nine elected farmer association chairmen were from families with no houses or land. The village head was a literate farmer, and the three administrative committee members were an enlightened small landlord, a wealthy middle peasant, and a rising middle peasant who had received land. Farmers commented on the election, saying, "From now on, the people of Xin Nong Village are one family, eating from the same pot. No one dares to oppress us anymore."

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 13th: Burning salt worker Xu Kezheng was elected Deputy County Chief of Rugao East County in the 9th Sub-district of Jiangsu and Anhui. Deputy County Chief Xu is from a town in East County, making a living by burning salt and farming, and suffered greatly from feudal landlord oppression. After the New Fourth Army marched eastward, he immediately led the salt workers in their struggle against the local tyrant Xu Guangzheng, organized a salt worker self-defense force, and was elected its captain. He successively held positions such as deputy political commissar of the coastal team. In 1945, he led the masses in guerrilla warfare, and the famous Wangjiazhang raid was planned and commanded by him. He lives frugally and is loved by the masses. His election as Deputy County Chief is widely regarded here as one of the important signs of the working people turning over and becoming masters of their own destiny after land reform. Since land reform, many poor and middle peasants in the county have risen up to take control of the government. A total of 19 district-level cadres and 159 township-level cadres have been promoted. The village governments have also been universally re-elected.

    东北土地改革完成区
    人民热烈乡选
    如皋烧盐工人当选副县长
    【新华社东北十三日电】：东北完成土地改革地区之乡村，选举业已开始，松江省肇州县新农屯在筹备选举乡长乡委员和所属九个村的农会主任时，该筹备委员忙得无片刻歇息。选举日清早，九个村村民全体出动，街上熙熙攘攘，如逢庙会盛节。选举结果，当选的九个农会主任都是房无一间地无一亩的人家。乡长是一个读过书的庄稼人，三个行政委员一个是开明小地主，一个富裕中农，一个是分得土地上升的中农。农民纷纷评论这次选举说：“从此咱新农屯的人成了一家人，在一口锅里吃饭，谁也不敢再欺压我们。”
    【新华社华中十三日电】烧盐工人徐可争，当选为苏皖九分区如皋东县副县长。徐副县长系东县×镇人，以烧盐并务农为生，受尽封建地主压迫。在新四军东进后，旋即领导盐民斗争恶霸徐光正，组织盐民自卫队，被推为队长。历任沿海队副政委等职。三十四年领导群众打游击，有名的王家漳大破击即系他布置指挥。他生活刻苦，素为群众所爱戴。此次当选副县长，此间咸认为是土地改革后劳动群众翻身做主的重要标志之一。该县自土地改革以来，许多贫农和中农起来掌握了政权。计先后提拔区级干部共十九人，乡级干部一百五十九人。并普遍改选了村政权。
