　　Taiyue Peasants Who Have Turned Over
    Participate in the Army and War to Defend Chairman Mao
    Jincheng Enlists Two Thousand People in Response to a Single Call
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch on the 24th] Slogans such as "Defend Yan'an, Defend Chairman Mao" have appeared on the walls of avenues in Yangcheng and other places. People are everywhere discussing "Chairman Mao is our great benefactor, and we must not let the reactionaries pull out even half a hair from his head." The unanimous call is: "Smash Chiang Kai-shek's offensive!" Old man Wang Shi from Hanshang Village, Yangcheng, said: "I relied on Chairman Mao to turn over, and I cannot forget Chairman Mao's kindness. I am too old to personally go to Yan'an to defend Chairman Mao, but I have already told my child Donglin to join Chairman Mao's ranks." A great wave of 2,500 people joining the army has been set off in Yangcheng. Gao Ping also has 1,500 people rushing to the front lines. After learning the news that Chiang Kai-shek was attacking Yan'an, more than ten villages in Jincheng Chengguan first launched a campaign to comfort the troops, contributing two pigs, twelve sheep, eighty chickens, eight hundred catties of vermicelli, and one hundred catties of wine, and intimately instructed the troops to "Fight harder and drive them into the Yellow River!" Tunliu and other counties have re-examined logistics work to do a better job in the self-defense war, and at the same time donated 45,000 yuan. Yangcheng stores are offering discounts of 20% on all kinds of goods to provide preferential treatment to the troops going to the front, telling the troops: "Comrades, remember to smash the reactionary forces attacking Yan'an!" All agencies are even more tense. When the administrative cadre school discussed defending Yan'an and defending Chairman Mao, twenty-seven intellectuals automatically requested to join the Eighth Route Army and go to the front to defend Chairman Mao. The Bureau of Industry and Commerce has formulated a production plan to increase production to support the front lines; the Wuwei General Assembly has called on local militias to cooperate in defending Yan'an and launching self-defense counterattacks, and must annihilate 800 enemies in December.

　　太岳翻身农民
    参军参战保卫毛主席
    晋城在一个号召下二千人入伍
    【本报太岳二十四日电】“保卫延安、保卫毛主席”等标语出现在阳城等地大道的墙上，人们到处在议论“毛主席是咱们的大恩人，决不能让反动派拔他半根汗毛”。一致呼声是：“打垮蒋介石的进攻”！阳城汉上村王实老汉说：“我靠毛主席翻身，不能忘了毛主席的恩，咱年纪大了，不能亲自到延安保卫毛主席，可是咱已叫孩子东林参加了毛主席的队伍”。阳城掀起了二千五百人参军的大浪潮。高平亦有一千五百人投奔前线。晋城城关十余村得到蒋介石进攻延安的消息，首先发动慰劳部队，计慰劳猪两口、羊十二只、鸡八十只、粉条八百斤、酒一百斤，亲切的嘱咐着部队“打得狠些，把他们打到黄河里去！”屯留等县重新研究了后勤工作，要把自卫战中的工作作得更好一点；同时献金四万五千元。阳城各商店为优待上前方的部队，各种货物的定价八折，他们对部队说：“同志记着一定要打垮进攻延安的反动队伍！”各机关更形紧张，行政干部学校讨论到保卫延安保卫毛主席，即有二十七个知识分子自动要求加入八路军，上前方保卫毛主席。工商局订出生产计划，增加生产支援前线；武委总会号召各地民兵配合保卫延安开展自卫反击，在十二月份须歼敌八百人。
