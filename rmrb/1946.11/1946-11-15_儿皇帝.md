    Puppet Emperor
    Bu Fu
    Holding a “military order” in his left hand,
    Holding a “political order” in his right hand,
    Saying "peace" with his mouth,
    But issuing war orders under his ass.
    Chairman, Commander-in-Chief,
    Titles too many to count,
    一心 To be a dictator,
    Using force for autocracy.
    Willing to be a puppet emperor,
    Recognizing the enemy as his father,
    All national power,
    Sold off completely.
    Surpasses Yuan Shikai,
    Worse than Wang Zhaoming,
    Traitorous national sellout,
    Old Jiang is number one.

    儿皇帝
    卜夫
    左手拿“军令”，
    右手拿“政令”，
    嘴里说“和平”，
    屁股下战令。
    主席、委员长，
    官衔数不清，
    一心要独裁，
    武力行专政。
    甘当儿皇帝，
    认贼作父亲，
    一切国家权，
    卖的干干净。
    赛过袁世凯，
    比倒汪兆铭，
    汉奸卖国贼，
    老蒋数头名。
