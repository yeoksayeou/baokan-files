(Our Dispatch from Changzhi, 19th) The various departments on the economic front in northern Henan are now actively transforming their organizational forms and management methods to strengthen the economic struggle against Chiang Kai-shek and his puppet regime. After our withdrawal from Jiaozuo, various industrial and commercial cooperative enterprises appropriately changed their management methods to adapt to wartime requirements. The Northern Henan Huaiqing Cooperative Headquarters directly organized this work with a capital of more than 40 million yuan. The original four branches were reorganized into eight branches, and three lines were divided. Three mobile economic teams were organized in the plains to conduct in-depth activities, absorbing cotton and Huai bamboo goods from the plains to support our currency and combat the enemy and puppet regime. The second and third lines have branches in ××, ××, and other places. In order to facilitate the timely exchange of materials from the Taihang Mountains and the special products of northern Henan, a material collection and transportation station has also been specially established in Changzhi. Various branches have already started business. Military supplies, civilian food, and daily necessities are being transported south in large quantities from Changzhi and Jincheng. Many places on the main road from the mountainous area of northern Henan to Lingchuan have now become new bustling markets. In order to better carry out the long-term economic struggle, the industrial and commercial departments recently held an economic conference to discuss new production cooperation plans for trade. It was determined that: 1. Organize professional production by the masses in the plain guerrilla areas, absorb materials, and combat the plunder of Chiang Kai-shek and his puppet regime, so that the bamboo industry and Huai goods can continue to develop. 2. Organize the production of refugees in a more planned way, and develop mutual assistance and cooperation in carrying poles, street vendors, and small-scale industry and commerce. 3. Exploit mountain mineral resources, such as sulfur and coal, which will be mined in large quantities this winter. (Note: Huai goods refer to goods from Huaiqing Prefecture.)
