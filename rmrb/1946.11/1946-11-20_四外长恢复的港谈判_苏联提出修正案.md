Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, November 15th: New York dispatch: The Four Foreign Ministers Conference has resumed negotiations on the Trieste issue, currently focusing on studying the Soviet Union's amendments to this issue. The Soviet side's amendments, including fourteen items, were presented to the US, British, and French foreign ministers yesterday. It is reported that Molotov stated that these are the minimum essential conditions the Soviet Union considers for resolving the Trieste port issue. The content of Molotov's amendments remains secret and is currently under study by the other foreign ministers. The Foreign Ministers Conference previously discussed the future legal system of the Free Territory of Trieste item by item on the 13th, based on the French proposal passed by the Paris Peace Conference. The main points of contention were Articles 5, 6, 7, and 8 of the French draft proposal, which described the powers of the Governor-General of the Free Territory: Article 6 stipulates that the Governor-General has the right to propose legislation on issues that, in his view, affect the United Nations' responsibility in the Free Territory, and to veto any legislation to the contrary. Article 7 gives the Governor-General the right to express opinions at all meetings of the Trieste Government Council. Article 8 concerns the administration of social order, security, and judicial officials. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov notified yesterday that Article 7 could not be accepted without modification; Article 8 was completely unacceptable because it gave excessive power to the undemocratic.
