　　Many Landlords and Local Bullies in Tunliu
    Sneak into Cooperatives to Continue Their Evil Deeds
    The Masses are Launching a Thorough Investigation and Struggle
    [Our Yangcheng Dispatch, 1st] In the Tunliu mass movement, it was discovered that many landlords and local bullies had infiltrated certain government production departments and rural cooperatives to evade liquidation struggles and continue to exploit the masses. The Sucun Cooperative in the Third District is a hiding place for several bad guys. They use the cooperative to maintain their reactionary rule. Everything must go through them, and they seize the fruits of the masses' struggle into the cooperative. They say they are serving the masses, but when the masses buy things on credit, if the grain price rises, they record it as grain, and if it falls, they record it as money, exploiting the masses. As a result, the masses are saying, "The cooperative is a 'living capture society.'" The Dongya Village Cooperative in the Third District is controlled by Li Zhaoheng, an object of struggle, as the manager. The goods sold are more expensive than in the city. The masses reflect, "Our village's cooperative is a bully's cooperative." The local leadership has now mobilized the masses to thoroughly investigate these hidden landlords and launch a struggle against them.

　　屯留不少地主恶霸
    钻入合作社继续作恶
    群众正发动大清查展开斗争
    【本报阳城一日讯】屯留群众运动中发现不少地主恶霸钻到某些机关生产部门和农村合作社里，逃避清算斗争，继续压榨群众。三区苏村合作社是几个坏家伙的藏身所，他们借合作社维持其反动统治，什么事都得通过他们，并把群众的斗争果实霸到合作社。他们嘴里说是为群众服务。但群众赊欠东西后，粮食涨了他们就记成粮食，落了就记成钱，从中剥削群众，致群众纷纷议论：“合作社是活捉社。”三区东崖村合作社被斗争对象李兆亨把持着当经理，卖的货物比城里贵，群众反映说：“俺村的合作社是恶霸的合作社。”现当地领导上已发动群众彻底清查此等隐避地主，并对之展开斗争。
