    [Handan, November 9th] Our correspondent reports from the headquarters of the Democratic Founding Army: The Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region People's Daily, published on October 31st, reached here tonight. After receiving it, General Gao Shuxun immediately read it carefully by lamplight. General Gao first read Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's congratulatory telegram to the Democratic Founding Army, as well as Commander-in-Chief Zhu's article "Celebrating the First Anniversary of General Gao Shuxun's Uprising." He then immediately asked General Liao Anbang, who was sitting next to him, to notify the General Political Department by telephone, ordering all officers and soldiers of the army to conduct in-depth study and discussion overnight. General Gao was extremely interested in the memorial article on Captain Liu Shanben. After reading it carefully, he recited it aloud to those present. At that moment, a telephone report came in announcing the news that the Ji-Lu-Yu region had annihilated another 8,000 soldiers of Chiang Kai-shek's invading army. Upon hearing this, General Gao clapped his hands and laughed, saying repeatedly: "Liu Bocheng's troops have rested well and won another great victory. Good, good!"

    [Handan, November 9th] Our correspondent reports from the headquarters of the Democratic Founding Army: In recent days, the reporter has extensively interviewed senior generals of the Democratic Founding Army, asking for their opinions on the current domestic situation. General Commander Gao Shuxun stated: "If the U.S. military does not leave, the Chinese civil war will not stop. The demand for the United States to withdraw from China is justified and necessary. At the same time, we should also demand that the United States cease its political oppression and economic aggression. We want a truly independent China." Deputy Commander Liao Anbang denounced Chiang Kai-shek, saying that he consistently goes back on his word and that the "peace offensive" is a delaying tactic. Second Army Commander Qiao Mingli said in a straightforward tone: We fought Japan for eight years, and the purpose was not to be a subjugated people of Japan. Now that the United States is invading our country, we will never be a subjugated people of the United States. We demand that the U.S. military withdraw from China, otherwise, we will not hesitate to defend our country with our heads and blood. Deputy Commander of the First Army, Xiao Zhongheng, based on his past experience of being deceived by Chiang Kai-shek, said: "Chiang Kai-shek is unwilling to have peace." Second Division Commander Tian Shuqing exposed Chiang's peace offensive, saying: "The responsibility for the civil war cannot be shirked, and the liberated areas and the people of the whole country will not be fooled by him again." General Tian hopes that the United Nations General Assembly can urge the United States to withdraw from China as soon as possible to realize peace in the Far East. Fourth Division Commander Gao Zhongxia, when talking about Chiang's "peace offensive," repeatedly said, "It's fake." and added, "He launches a full-scale offensive, and we will resist in full force until we defeat his offensive."
