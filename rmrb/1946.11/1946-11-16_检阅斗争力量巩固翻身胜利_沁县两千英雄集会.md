    Reviewing the Strength of Struggle, Consolidating the Victory of Emancipation
    Two Thousand Heroes Gather in Qin County
    [Yangcheng, This newspaper, 12th dispatch] Qin County convened a gathering of two thousand emancipated heroes at the end of last month. This is an unprecedented review by the masses of peasants in Qin County of their struggle against thousands of years of feudal forces. In the past eighty days, two thousand heroes have led the people of the county in a fierce struggle against treacherous bullies and landlords, and the face of the countryside has greatly changed. Of the 90,000 people in the newly liberated areas of the county, half have participated in the struggle. The movement has spread to 201 villages, and the peasants have recovered more than 29,000 mu of land, with some villages having achieved "land to the tiller." In Nanyao Village, of the 223 households, 108 were poor peasants before the movement, and now they have all risen to the level of middle peasants, recovering more than 1,230 mu of land. Currently, the peasants in the village with the most land have 5.5 mu per person, and those with the least have 3.5 mu per person. In Shangcun Village, of the 60 households, 36 were poor peasants before the movement, and now they have all risen to the level of middle peasants. They have recovered more than 300 mu of land, with those having the most land having 8 mu per person and those with the least having 5 mu per person. In Quanzi Village, of the 92 households, there were originally 57 hired and poor peasant households, and now all have risen to the level of middle peasants. The masses throughout the county celebrated this grand event with extremely high enthusiasm. On that day, all organs and shops in the city were decorated with lanterns and colored banners. As the two thousand heroes marched in formation into the city from the North Gate, they were warmly welcomed by the masses along the streets. Old man Li Yaotang from Langzhuang squeezed to the front of the column, with tears in his eyes, and said, "I suffered poverty all my life, and in the end, my child was also conscripted by Yan Xishan. Fortunately, the Eighth Route Army came this time, and we finally saw the light of day!" Dr. Fei from the People's Hospital, a Christian, also nodded when he saw this mighty contingent, saying, "This is truly the sentiment of the working masses!" Emancipated peasant Wei Quanwang pulled a yellow ox he had just recovered into the city to attend the meeting, and said excitedly, "Without these people (referring to the emancipated heroes), how could I have this ox?" During the meeting, emancipated hero Zhang Maohai encouraged everyone, saying, "It's not enough for us to be emancipated; we must also help those who have not yet been emancipated to be emancipated. Only then can we live a good life firmly!"
