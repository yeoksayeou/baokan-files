[Hsinhua News Agency, Ji-Lu-Yu Front] Since its liberation last spring, Daicun, Neihuang, has undergone struggles such as rent reduction and interest rate reduction, and anti-local bullies, and established a peasant association; however, the masses have not been emancipated, and landlords and bullies still oppress the masses. The village is only six li away from the Wei River, and the KMT-controlled area is not far to the west of the river. In addition, the denunciation of the big local bully, Tie Yanping, involved his second son enlisting in the KMT army, and he spread rumors on the street all day long, saying, "The Central Army is about to attack! The Eighth Route Army is failing!" The masses' thoughts of a change of regime were quite serious, and although they urgently wanted to be emancipated, they were afraid to move under the oppression of the bullies. The working comrades in the district understood the masses' demands: "Without thoroughly defeating the bully Tie Yanping, they will never be able to stand up." They seized the gaps in the war, and in addition to war support work, they went to the village to mobilize the masses. In order to take charge for the masses and suppress the reactionary arrogance of landlords and bullies, they first detained the bully landlord Tie Yanping and others, and then convened a mass meeting, stating our attitude "to help the peasants thoroughly emancipate themselves." Then, after three meetings of more than a thousand people in the village and group discussions, a public grievance and liquidation was carried out at the meeting. As many as 48 crimes were brought against Tie Yanping alone. Under the righteous reasoning of the masses, the bullies bowed their heads, and some small landlords who had made mistakes also confessed their mistakes to everyone at the mass meeting, and voluntarily took out land and grain to compensate for the losses of the masses. Three middle-peasant households had a misconception because of this and voluntarily offered some land and grain, but the masses unanimously refused their things and returned them all. As a result, the masses of the whole village obtained a total of 1,265 mu of land, 36 shi and 4 dou of grain, 69 houses, and 490,000 yuan in cash. Regarding the distribution of land, after discussion by a joint meeting of 52 village representatives, it was decided that each person should have at least 2 mu or more of standard land. It was decided that the general standard would be 2 mu of standard land, and the activists in the struggle could be appropriately increased according to the situation, and military dependents would receive half more than ordinary poor members and be given good land near their homes. A total of 38 mu of standard land was distributed to five military dependents households in the village, and 939.6 mu were distributed to 160 poor peasants, with an average of 2 to 3 mu per person, realizing land to the tiller. Most of the poor peasants in the village have been upgraded to middle peasants. The number of peasant association members has also increased from 48 to 450, the number of women association members has developed to 457, the children's corps has 118 members, and the sister's group has 103 members, organizing a total of 1,128 people. Only 21 households, a total of 72 people, in the entire village did not participate in the organization. Everyone said, "What are we afraid of if we have food and clothing?" In order to defend the land and their livelihood, more than ten militiamen have been established in the village, and they have united with the militiamen of nearby villages to guard the banks of the Wei River to prevent sudden attacks by the KMT army. Zhang Lianjing and other 25 young people voluntarily signed up to join the army, determined to go to the front line and fight desperately with the traitor Chiang Kai-shek.

　　内黄代村粉碎地主造谣反攻
    抓紧战斗空隙翻透身
    青壮参军民兵联防保家乡
    【本报冀鲁豫讯】内黄代村从去年春天解放以来，虽然也经过了减租减息、反恶霸等斗争，成立了农会；可是群众都没翻身，地主恶霸仍压在群众头上。该村离卫河只六里路，河西不远的地方就是蒋占区，加上声讨大恶霸铁延平又把他二儿送到蒋军里去当兵，并在街上整天造谣，说什么：“中央军快打过来啦！八路军不行啦！”群众的变天思想相当厉害，虽然迫切的想要翻身，但被恶霸压着不敢动。区里工作同志了解了群众的要求：“不彻底打垮恶霸铁延平，万年也不能翻身抬头”。就抓紧战争空隙，在战勤工作之余，到该村去发动群众。为了给群众作主，镇压地主恶霸反动气焰，就首先把恶霸地主铁延平等扣起来，然后召开群众大会，表明我们的态度“要帮助农民彻底翻身”。接着，经过全村千人以上的三次大会，分组酝酿，就在大会上进行诉苦清算，光对铁延平一人就提出罪恶四十八条之多。在群众的正义说理下，恶霸们低头了，一些有错误的小地主，也就相继在群众大会上，向大家坦白的承认错误，自动拿出田地、粮食来赔偿群众的损失。有三户中农由此曾发生了错觉，也自动献出一些田地和粮食，但群众一致不要他们的东西，全部给退回去了。结果，全村群众共得到土地一千二百六十五亩，粮食三十六石四斗，房子六十九间，现款四十九万元。关于土地的分配，经五十二人的村代表联席会讨论，每人至少能合标准地二亩以上，便决定一般的都按二亩标准地取齐，斗争中的积极分子可以酌量情形增加一点，军属则比一般贫苦会员多一半，并分给近地好地。全村五户军属共分标准地三十八亩，一百六十户赤、贫农分地九百三十九亩六分，每人平均由二亩到三亩，实现了耕者有其田，全村贫农大部都上升为中农了。农会员也由四十八人增加到四百五十人，妇会员发展到四百五十七人，儿童团一百十八人，姊妹团一百零三人，共组织群众一千一百二十八人，全村未参加组织的只有二十一户，共七十二口人。大家都说：“有吃有穿还怕啥？”为了保卫土地和饭碗，全村已成立民兵十余人，和附近各村民兵联合起来，守卫在卫河边沿上，防止蒋军的突然袭击。张连景等二十五名青年，并自动报名参军，决心上前线去和蒋介石卖国贼拚命。
