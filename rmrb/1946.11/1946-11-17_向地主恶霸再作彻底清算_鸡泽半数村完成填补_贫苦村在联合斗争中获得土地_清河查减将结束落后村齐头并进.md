[Report from this newspaper in Wei County, 13th] The filling and leveling movement in Jize has entered a high tide. All 144 villages in the county are advancing in a balanced manner. The characteristic of the movement is a comprehensive struggle. Peasants voice their grievances, demand debts, and seek justice against feudal oppressors. Because this liquidation is thorough, the fruits of the struggle are more than ten times greater than in the previous stage. In Baizhi Li Village alone, 320 mu of land, more than 100 houses, and 32,000 jin of grain were cleared out. It is estimated that the land distribution will result in an average of at least three and a half mu of land per person throughout the county, and villages with less land will be adjusted by villages with more land through joint struggle. Currently, more than 80 villages in the first, seventh, and fourth districts have ended the struggle. Peasants are further organized in the movement, and the number of farmer association members has surged. In Bajiazhai in the first district, among 160 households, the number of poor peasants who joined the farmers' association twice increased by more than one-third compared to before the movement. In the fourth district, 44 villages have increased by two to seven times, and the militia in Gezhuang has increased from 10 to 40 people. Most of the village cadres have also been reformed, with poor peasants becoming the leading backbone, and middle peasants also accounting for one-fifth. Three experiences were gained in this movement. (1) At the beginning of the movement, classes must be divided so that peasants clearly recognize that "middle and poor peasants are one family" and the distinction between landlords and peasants, so as not to harm middle peasants. (2) To unify thinking, it must proceed from the unified thinking of party members to the unified thinking of the masses. (3) During the movement, village cadres must be adjusted in a timely manner, and poor peasant activists must be cultivated and promoted to strengthen the leading backbone.
    [Report from this newspaper in Wei County, 13th] The filling and leveling movement launched in Qinghe during investigation and rent reduction has made significant progress. From the beginning of last month to the end of last month, the struggles in the first and second districts have been initially successful. The fourth and fifth districts have also been initially completed. The third district is underway. In the first district, 50 villages have carried out struggles. Backward villages such as Houshidian and Niutun have also been involved in the movement. The district has fought back more than 1,600 mu of land. Including temple land and clan land, there are 3,000 mu in total. In the second district, the land fought back and the land donated reached 3,000 mu (excluding public land and temple land). All the extremely poor have risen. Some villages don't even have poor peasants anymore, such as Ge Xian Zhuang, Yang Ru Lin, Liu Shuang Miao, Cai Jia Zhuang, and Liu Lin. In the filling and leveling movement in the third district, the development of organizations and the resolution of outstanding cases were generally carried out. For example, the Jianzhuang Farmers' Association increased from 30 to 80 people, and the Yangzhuang Farmers' Association increased from 100 to 203 people. The militia increased from 52 to 70 people. Farmers' requests to join the association are very urgent. Ge Chengxin, a poor peasant in Yangzhuang, told the director of the farmers' association: "I have no parents and no support, please register me." In some villages, many families are members. Many outstanding cases in various villages have been resolved very well. For example, in the struggle in Wanggongzhuang last winter and this spring, the trade union monopolized the process, and the village cadres embezzled public funds. The new director elected after the wheat harvest also had corruption problems when demolishing the temple. After "resolving the knots," the village cadres confessed their mistakes and compensated for the losses to the masses, who were very satisfied, and the village cadres also changed their style. The village chief of Lihuzhuang tried to benefit himself by provoking disunity among other cadres, and the director of the farmers' association was corrupt. After resolving the "knots," a close atmosphere between the masses and cadres began to appear. The director of the Qian Gui Village Farmers' Association confessed that he privately used 4,500 yuan of agricultural loans for business, and the deputy director confessed his mistakes and swore: "If I do this again in the future, may I die without a burial place!" Because "resolving the knots" was generally carried out, unprecedented unity was achieved between cadres and the masses, and between the masses in various villages. The investigation and rent reduction movement in various villages in the third district is continuing.

    向地主恶霸再作彻底清算
    鸡泽半数村完成填补
    贫苦村在联合斗争中获得土地
    清河查减将结束落后村齐头并进
    【本报威县十三日电】鸡泽填平补齐运动已进入高潮。全县一百四十四村，正平衡向前推进。运动的特点是一揽子斗争。农民对封建压迫者有苦就诉，有债就讨，有冤就伸。由于这次清算的彻底，斗争果实比上一阶段多十倍以上，仅柏枝李村即清算出土地三百二十亩，房百余间，粮食三万两千斤。估计土地分配结果，全县平均每人最低有三亩半地，地少村则由联合斗争中地多村设法调剂。现一、七、四区已有八十余村结束斗争。农民在运动中更进一步组织起来，农会会员激增。一区八家寨一百六十户中，贫农两次加入农会比运动前增加三分之一以上。四区四十四村均增加两倍至七倍，革庄民兵由十人增至四十人。村干部亦大部分经过改造，贫农成为领导骨干，中农亦占五分之一。这次运动中得到三点经验。（一）运动开始先划分阶级，农民明确认识“中贫农是一家”，及地主与农民的区分，以免伤损中农。（二）统一思想，必须由党员思想统一进到群众思想统一。（三）运动中须及时调整村干部，培养提拔贫农积极分子加强领导骨干。
    【本报威县十三日电】清河查减中展开的填平补齐运动已获重大进展。自上月初至上月底，一、二两区的斗争已初步告捷。四区、五区也初步斗完。三区正在开展中。一区有五十个村进行了斗争。落后村如后食店、牛屯等，也卷入运动，该区共斗回土地一千六百多亩。连庙地、族地等共有三千亩。二区光斗回土地与献田即达三千亩（公田、庙地不在内）。赤贫全部均已上升。有些村连贫农也没有了。如葛仙庄、杨儒林、刘双庙、蔡家庄、柳林等。三区在填平补齐运动中，普遍进行了发展组织和解决悬案。如简庄农会由三十人发展到八十人，杨庄农会由一百人发展到二百零三人。民兵由五十二人发展到七十人。农民入会的要求非常迫切。杨庄贫农葛承新找农会主任说：“俺没爹没娘没依靠，报个名罢。”有些村庄很多是家家在会。各村的悬案有许多解决的很好。如王宫庄去冬今春的斗争中，工会包办，村干吃私，麦后选的新主任领导拆庙时也有贪污。经过“解疙瘩，”村干部向群众坦白了错误、赔偿了损失，群众很满意，村干部也转变了作风。李胡庄村长为自己落好，挑拨别的干部不团结，农会主任贪污腐化，经过解“疙瘩”，群众干部间的亲密气氛开始出现。前桂村农会主任坦白自己私用农贷四千五百元作买卖，副主任坦白自己的错误后，宣誓说：“今后若再这样，叫我死无葬身之地！”由于普遍进行了“解疙瘩”，各村干部与群众群众与群众之间达到了空前团结。现在三区各村的查减运动正继续展开。
