　　Guizhou Salt Shortage
    People Eating Bland Food
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 4th] China currently lacks 170,000 to 180,000 tons of edible salt annually, but the Chiang government continues to supply Japan with huge quantities of salt as a raw material for the chemical industry. According to reports in the Ta Kung Pao on the 27th and 31st of last month, this action was "mediated" by MacArthur. The Chiang government's Ministry of Finance has announced that it will ship 10 million *shi* of salt to Japan this year. Since the victory against Japan, over 120,000 tons have been shipped from the Qingdao area alone, and including the amounts from Taiwan, Changlu, and Fujian, the total reaches nearly 200,000 tons. This export of salt to Japan allows the Japanese alkali industry to receive raw material supplies. Since the alkali will be largely sold in China, Chinese chemical industrialists are saying that this move will put "China's alkali industry to death."

    【新华社延安四日电】目前中国自己每年食盐不足十七八万吨，但蒋政府却继续以巨量食盐供给日本，作为化学工业原料。据大公报上月二十七日及三十一日讯中透露：此举系经麦克阿瑟的“斡旋”。蒋政府财政部已发表本年将以一千万石食盐输日。自抗战胜利迄今，青岛区已运去十二万余吨，连同台湾，长芦、福建三区之数，共达廿万吨弱，此种输日食盐，使日本制碱工业得到原料接济自碱将在中国大部倾销，我国化学工业家咸谓此举将置“我国制碱工业于死忘”。
