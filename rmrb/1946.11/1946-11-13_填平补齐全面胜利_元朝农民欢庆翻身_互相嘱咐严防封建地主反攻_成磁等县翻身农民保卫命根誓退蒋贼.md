    Filling Gaps, Making Up Deficiencies, Total Victory
    Yuan Dynasty Peasants Celebrate Liberation
    Mutually Reminding Each Other to Strictly Guard Against Feudal Landlord Counterattacks
    Chengcí and Other Counties' Liberated Peasants Vow to Defend Their Lifeline and Repel the Chiang Kai-shek Bandits
    [Our Newspaper, Weixian, 9th] After the Yuan Dynasty's "Filling Gaps, Making Up Deficiencies" movement achieved total victory, villages held celebrations for their liberation, parades, introspection sessions, and vows, expressing their determination to follow the Communist Party and repel Chiang Kai-shek's invasion. In Shao Dianzi, District Eight, on the evening of October 22nd, lights blazed like daytime and drums and gongs resounded. Peasants marched in formation to Wang Guang Village, half a li away, to hold a joint celebration with the masses of both villages. When the village cadres spoke, they emphasized: "The poor are one family under heaven; the masses of the two villages must unite closely." They also reminded each other: "Be vigilant against the counter-offensive schemes of the feudal landlords." After the meeting, the masses of Shao Dianzi returned to their village and held a general meeting. Chang Lianyu, a poor peasant in his sixties, said: "The landlord Zhao Mingshan forcibly occupied my land. I thought I would never be able to vent this anger. Since the Communist Party came and led us to turn ourselves around, I got my land back and overthrew the petty tyrant. The big tyrant, Old Chiang, is attacking our liberated areas. Although our old men's brigade can't join the army, we must work hard in the rear."
    [Our Newspaper, Weixian, 6th] The broad masses of peasants in various places are celebrating the victory of their liberation and responding to the call of the Central Bureau, mobilizing to support the front lines and prepare for war to defend their homes. At the celebration meeting for the liberation of 20,000 people in the Fourth District of Chengcí, the masses of each village were extremely excited. Zhang, a sixty-year-old councilor, said: "We have turned ourselves around and got land, but we have only defeated the landlords and despots. There is also the great traitor Chiang Kai-shek who wants to seize our fruits of victory and attack the Pinghan Line. We must unite and drive him back!" The director of the Women's Association of Shangcheng Village said: "Chairman Mao has just led us to turn ourselves around, and Chiang Kai-shek wants to take our fruits! Let the men join the army to fight Chiang Kai-shek, and we women won't hold them back!" Seven heroes immediately signed up to join the army on the spot. At the celebration meeting for the liberation of more than 20,000 people in the Second District, the representative of Ai Village said: "Old Chiang wants to take our land, so we must arm ourselves to defend our fruits!" On the thirteenth of last month, the Fifth District held a mass meeting of 20,000 organized people in Matou Town on the banks of the Fuyang River to celebrate their liberation. At the meeting, the militia captain of Zhengjia Village said: "I have worked as a hired hand for nine years and suffered for nine years. Chairman Mao led us to turn ourselves around. Not only do we have land to cultivate and houses to live in, but I also married a wife. Old Chiang doesn't like us turning ourselves around anyway, so we have to fight him to the death!" At the celebration meeting for the liberation of 18,000 people in the First District of Linzhang, they vowed to follow Chairman Mao forever. The people's representatives also strongly pointed out: "Our poor people's enemy is Chiang Kai-shek. Let's unite and fight Old Chiang!" Cadres from various villages in the Second District of Weixian automatically connected more than 10,000 people and held a celebration meeting on October 15th. A liberated hero said at the meeting: "Today is a victory meeting, a day for us poor people to raise our heads, and also a mobilization meeting for self-defense and war preparedness." After the liquidation struggle in Nan Ding Cao Village in Ningnan, 1,500 people held a meeting to celebrate their liberation, and the masses were in high spirits. Zhang Jintang said: "Now it's our turn to be happy! My family has been working as hired hands and suffering poverty for three generations. Now we have land, which is our lifeline! Old Chiang wants to take my lifeline, so we must repel him!"
