　　Reading a Poem
　　Lu Dingyi

　　I read "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang" with great joy, because it is a poem.

　　Since the "Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," the first achievements have been in drama. In that year, new-style Yangge dances appeared. "Brother and Sister Reclaiming Wasteland" has now spread throughout the country. The new drama movement is very broad, reformed Peking Opera has appeared, Qin腔 operas like "Blood and Tears of Hatred" and "Defend Peace" have appeared, and the new-style opera "The White Haired Girl" has appeared. The gains in this area are the fastest and richest. Drama has truly reached the masses of the people.

　　Following closely behind is woodcut art. This field has eliminated foreign styles and adopted Chinese styles, and has also achieved great success. Now, the woodcuts of the liberated areas represent China and have gained a position in the world.

　　Coming later were novels and storytelling, which only emerged in the last year or two. In novels, such as "Li Youcai's Sayings," "Heroes of Lüliang," "Anti-Japanese Hero Yang Tie Tong," and "Li Yong Sets Up Landmine Arrays," have gained a wide readership, educated a wide readership, and opened a new page in the field of novels. In storytelling, many scripts compiled by Han Qixiang show the amazing talent of folk artists.

　　Coming even later is poetry. "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang" is such a new poem. Using rich folk vocabulary to write poetry, with good content and form, there is Mr. Yuan Shuipai outside (Note: Mr. Yuan has recently often used the pen name Ma Fanto to write satirical poems—Editor), and now we have it here too.

　　We see that the literary and artistic movement is breaking through layers of barriers and advancing vigorously. A new set of things has emerged, and a batch of new figures has emerged. Each such victory represents the victory of the new democratic literary and artistic movement over the feudal comprador reactionary literary and artistic movement. The new culture is capturing the fortresses of the old culture one by one. The reactionary literature and art, because it has "national forms," although its content is extremely reactionary, occupies a place among the people and poisons the people. If revolutionary literature and art does not learn its own national form, that is, the form that the working people like to see and hear, even if the content is very good, it will not be possible to overthrow and eliminate the influence of the old literature and art in the minds of hundreds of millions of people.

　　The struggle of culture, this is bloodless. However, unless we capture the countless fortresses built by feudal culture over thousands of years one by one, and establish new democratic cultural fortresses, there will be no new society. This is an extremely difficult task, requiring extremely persistent efforts. Thank you, Chairman Mao, he showed us the way. Thank you to the many comrades who lead literary and artistic workers to follow Chairman Mao's line, their efforts have been rewarded. Thank you to the pioneers of new literature and art, the comrades who have cleared the way on the literary and artistic front, they are combat heroes on the literary and artistic front. We are still far from completing the task, do not be proud, do not stop. (Reprinted from the Liberation Daily, September 28, page 4)

### 读了一首诗

　　读了一首诗
    陆定一
    我以极大的喜悦读了《王贵与李香香》。因为这是一首诗。
    自从“文艺座谈会”以来，首先表现出成绩来的是戏剧。那年就有新式的秧歌出场了。“兄妹开荒”现在已经传遍全国。新的戏剧运动，范围非常广大，改良的平剧出现了，《血泪仇》和《保卫和平》等秦腔戏出现了，新式的歌剧《白毛女》出现了。这方面的收获最快，最丰富。戏剧真正到了人民大众里面去了。
    其次跟着来的，是木刻。这方面革除了外国气派，采取了中国气派，也有很大的成绩。现在解放区的木刻，代表了中国，在全世界有了地位。
    来得更晚些的，是小说和说书，这是最近一两年间才有的。小说里面，如《李有才板话》，《吕梁英雄传》，《抗日英雄洋铁桶》，《李勇大摆地雷阵》等，获得广大的读者，教育了广大的读者，并在小说的领域里展开了新的一页。在说书的方面，有韩起祥编的许多本子，显出民间艺人惊人的天才。
    比较来得更迟的，就是诗了。《王贵与李香香》，就是这样的新诗。用丰富的民间语汇来做诗，内容形式都好的，在外面有袁水拍先生（按：袁先生近年常用以写刺讽诗之笔名为马凡陀——编者），现在我们这里也有了。
    我们看到：文艺运动突破一重重关，猛晋不已。出来了新的一套，出来了一批新的人物。每有一次这样的胜利，都表示了新民主主义文艺运动对于封建的买办的反动的文艺运动的胜利。新的文化在一个一个的夺取旧文化的堡垒。反动的文艺，因为它有“民族形式”，虽然内容反动极了，但在人民之中据有地盘，毒害人民。革命的文艺如果不学会自己的民族形式，即劳动人民所喜见乐闻的形式，那怕内容很好，就不可能在几万万人民的头脑里把旧文艺的影响打倒、肃清。
    文化的斗争，这是不流血的。但是，不把几千年来的封建文化所筑下的无数堡垒一个个的夺取过来，并建立起新民主主义的文化堡垒，那就不会有新的社会。这是一件极其烦难的工作，需要极其坚韧不拔的努力。谢谢毛主席，他给我们指出了道路。谢谢领导文艺工作者走毛主席的路线的许多同志，他们的努力有收获。谢谢新文艺的开路先锋的各位同志，他们在文艺战线上披荆斩棘开出了道路，他们是文艺战线上的战斗英雄。我们离开完成任务还很远，不要骄傲，不要停止。（转载九月二十八日解放日报四版）
