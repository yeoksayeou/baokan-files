　　“The pro-foreign government doesn't care, so the people will!”
    Shanghai compatriots capture eight American thugs
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 6th] Shanghai dispatch: After Chiang Kai-shek ordered newspapers to ban reports of American military atrocities, the atrocities of the American military have become increasingly rampant. Patriotic compatriots in Shanghai, unwilling to be humiliated, have sent letters to various newspapers, indignantly saying: "The pro-foreign government doesn't care, so we the people will!" On the evening of October 17th, four American sailors, riding in rickshaws, passed near the Cathay Hotel on Nanjing Road. One of them snatched several rings from a Chinese vendor's tray. The vendor chased after them, but the American soldiers kicked the rickshaw puller to make him run faster. Bystanders, indignant, stepped forward to stop the American soldiers and questioned them reasonably. However, the sailors were unreasonable and started beating people, knocking out a front tooth of a Mr. Yao, causing him to bleed profusely. One American sailor even chased a sixteen-year-old child. Yet the military police on Nanjing Road turned a blind eye, saying: "In Chinese territory, we don't care about foreigners." The bystanders were extremely indignant and arrested the four culprits, taking them to the US Naval Police. On the morning of the 20th, an American soldier forcibly seized a Chinese man's rickshaw and drove it recklessly, injuring a pedestrian, Zhuang Guangfu, in the back. The American soldier tried to escape, but was chased by several pedestrians and the rickshaw puller, Zhang Debiao, and was finally captured at the Bund on Nanjing Road. On the evening of the 22nd, a vendor, Hu Xingcai, encountered five American soldiers at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Sichuan Road. One of the American soldiers suddenly snatched several rings from the vendor. The vendor chased after him, but the American soldier struck Hu's head violently and threw a bottle at his face, causing him to bleed profusely and become unrecognizable. However, Hu, disregarding his serious injuries, endured the pain and bravely caught the culprit. Dozens of bystanders gathered around, shouting: "Don't let him go! Don't let him go!" Although American military police were there to cheer them on, the masses, indignant at the humiliation of their compatriots, disregarded everything and prevented the culprit from escaping, finally handing him over to the police station. On the evening of the 27th, two American soldiers again groundlessly chased and beat a rickshaw puller, Tang Fugao, near Baiguang Road and Datong Road. Tang's head was broken and bleeding, causing him to fall to the ground in extreme pain. The passersby were indignant and chased after the criminals, finally capturing them on Nanjing Road and sending them to the police station.
