　　International Week
    America Becomes More Isolated, Domestic Difficulties Increase
    In the past week, two symbolic events occurred: First, regarding the issue of the port and the border between Italy and Yugoslavia in direct negotiations between the two countries, among the four powers, the Soviet Union, Britain, and France all expressed their support, with only the United States opposing. This happened after the French elections and the British House of Commons foreign policy debate, signifying that the increasing leftward leanings of the French and British people have begun to influence the foreign policies of the two countries. During the British House of Commons debate, 41% of Labour Party members opposed following the American foreign policy, which is similar to the record of voting against Bevin's foreign policy at the Labour Party meeting last month. This naturally cannot but influence the policy of the British authorities, even though the ruling party is still the right wing of the Labour Party. The division among the four powers on the issue of Italy-Yugoslavia negotiations shows the trend of the future development of the international situation—American imperialism will fall into isolation.
    Second, the development of labor strikes in the United States. The coal mine strike has begun, severely hitting the domestic economy, and the Congress of Industrial Organizations has decided to launch a wage increase movement next spring. The domestic difficulties of American imperialism will increase with time.
    World Democratic Movement Advances by Leaps and Bounds
    While American imperialism is becoming increasingly isolated abroad and domestic difficulties are increasing, in the past week, the world democratic movement has made strides forward. In addition to the above, Dimitrov has formed a new government led by the Bulgarian Communist Party, the chairman of the Belgian Communist Party also serves as the vice-speaker of the House of Representatives, the Labor Party won the first place in the North Korean election, and the Romanian Democratic Party group also won an overwhelming advantage in the election; there are also two major Japanese labor unions uniting to fight for the election of the Yoshida cabinet, and so on.
    UN General Assembly Begins to Discuss the Issue of US Troops Stationed in China
    As for the United Nations General Assembly, what is noteworthy is that the Political and Security Committee has begun to discuss the Soviet proposal to investigate foreign troops stationed abroad and the US troops stationed in China interfering in China's internal affairs. Currently, the differences among the three powers lie in: The Soviet Union advocates that the investigation of foreign troops stationed abroad is an urgent matter, and the investigation of each country's own military strength should be done later when discussing disarmament issues; the United States and Britain advocate that the two should be carried out simultaneously to cover up the fact that their foreign troops are interfering in other countries' internal affairs, and regard the investigation as a disarmament issue.

　　国际一周
    美国更趋孤立国内困难日增
    过去一周内发生象征性的事件两起：其一为在意南两国直接谈判的港及两国边界问题上，四强之中，苏、英、法三国均表赞同，只有美国反对。此事适发生在法国大选及英下院外交辩论之后，意味着法英两国人民的日益左倾已开始在两国外交政策上发生影响。英下院辩论时，工党议员中反对追随美国的外交政策者占百分之四十一，适与上月劳工会中投票反对贝文的外交政策的纪录相当，这自然不能不影响英国当局的政策，虽然当政者仍是工党的右派。这次在意南谈判问题上的四强分野，显示了今后国际形势发展的趋势——美帝国主义将陷于孤立。
    其二为美国国内工潮的发展。煤矿大罢工业已开始，严重打击国内经济，而产业工会联合会又决定于明春发动增资运动。美帝国主义的国内困难将与时俱增。
    世界民主运动大踏步向前进
    在这美帝国主义国外渐趋孤立，国内困难日增之际，过去一周内，世界民主运动迈步向前。除上述者外，尚有季米特洛夫已组成以保共为首的新政府，比共主席兼任众院副议长，韩北大选中劳工党占第一位，罗马尼亚民主政党集团亦在选举中获压倒优势；还有日两大工会联合为推选吉田内阁而奋斗等等。
    联大开始讨论美军驻华问题
    至于联合国大会引人注意者为政治安全委员会中开始讨论苏联所提议的调查外国驻军及美国驻华军队干涉中国内政。目前三强分歧点在于：苏联主张调查外国驻军为当务之急，而调查各国本国兵力应在以后讨论裁军问题时做；美英则主张两者同时进行，以掩饰其驻外军队干涉别国内政之事实，而将调查当作是裁军问题。
