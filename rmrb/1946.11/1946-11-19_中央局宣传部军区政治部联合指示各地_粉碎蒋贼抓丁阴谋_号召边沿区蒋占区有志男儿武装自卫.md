    Central Bureau Propaganda Department and Military Region Political Department Jointly Instruct Various Regions
    Crush Chiang Kai-shek's Plot to Seize Recruits
    Call on Patriotic Young Men in Border and Chiang-Occupied Areas to Arm Themselves for Self-Defense
    Young and Strong Men in Northern Henan Come to Our Area in an Endless Stream to Avoid Becoming Cannon Fodder for Chiang Kai-shek
    [Our Newspaper, Handan, 18th Dispatch] In order to oppose Chiang Kai-shek's capture of young people from the Liberated Areas and to oppose the destructive activities of armed special agents "Returning Home Corps" everywhere, the Propaganda Department of the Central Bureau of Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu and the Political Department of the Military Region have jointly instructed various regions to carry out in-depth propaganda against conscription and against the "Returning Home Corps" based on the specific circumstances of the local self-defense struggle, and to widely paint slogans to encourage the enthusiasm of all soldiers and civilians in the border areas to protect their homes and defend themselves. Regarding the propaganda against conscription, it should be particularly pointed out that Chiang Kai-shek's forces are insufficient, and they have lost 35 brigades. His plot is to capture young men and strong men in the Liberated Areas, massacre compatriots in the Liberated Areas, and become cannon fodder for the Chiang-American reactionaries. We should call on patriotic young men in the border areas and Chiang-occupied areas to arm themselves and wage guerrilla warfare, actively oppose Chiang Kai-shek's conscription, and protect their own liberated interests. For the young people captured by Chiang's army, they should be called upon to escape with their guns and return to the Liberated Areas. The democratic government should give them special rewards and preferential treatment. For those who help Chiang's army to seize recruits, the Eighth Route Army and the people must resolutely suppress them! Regarding the armed special agent "Returning Home Corps," we must expose their various crimes of killing people, seizing recruits, and robbing grain as much as possible, and call on the soldiers and civilians of the entire region to resolutely eliminate them; for the coerced elements among them, they should be called upon to immediately repent and start anew, and lay down their weapons. The democratic government will not punish them for their past deeds. For fleeing landlords, as long as they do not sabotage the Liberated Areas, the democratic government welcomes them back and takes care of their lives.
    [Our Newspaper, Changzhi, 18th Dispatch] Chiang's army is frantically seizing recruits in the occupied areas of northern Henan. When they encounter villagers, they drive them back to their strongholds under the pretext of working as laborers or serving as grooms, and then send them to the troops as soldiers. It is reported that Chiang's army plans to conscript more than a thousand recruits in each county in Xiuwu, Bo'ai, Qinyang, and Wuzhi counties recently. According to Chiang's army prisoners captured in the Wanshan battle in Qinyang, "The newly captured recruits cannot get enough to eat. Chiang's puppets are afraid that they will run away, so they often threaten them, saying, 'If you run away, your whole family will be killed.' But when they are transferred, many people still take the opportunity to escape."
    [Our Newspaper, Changzhi, 18th Dispatch] Chiang's puppets in Hui County are frantically seizing recruits. The stubborn county magistrate, Guan Chaoyan, issued an order to forcibly conscript recruits (16 to 20 recruits per large Bao, 10 to 14 recruits per small Bao). As a result, as soon as night falls, the villages in the Chiang-occupied areas are in turmoil, people are panicked, and every household is uneasy. Young and strong men in various villages have fled to our Liberated Areas. Even the Bao chiefs dare not sleep at home at night because they cannot cope. A certain stubborn town government spent money everywhere to buy recruits, but to no avail. Therefore, on the evening of the 8th, they led the stubborn security regiment to surround Nan Yunmen Village and arrested dozens of young people. One young man was brutally killed on the spot for refusing to be arrested. According to a young man who escaped from the Chiang-controlled area of Xinxiang, the young people who failed to escape in that area were all washed with prickly ash water to swell their testicles so that they could not move, and their second thumbs were chopped off with knives. The democratic government is extremely concerned about this. In addition to posting notices calling on young people in the Chiang-occupied areas to escape to the Liberated Areas, it has also set up reception centers in Yanglvchuan, Chengguan, and the 7th, 8th, and 9th districts of the county to settle the lives of the escaped young people.

    中央局宣传部军区政治部联合指示各地
    粉碎蒋贼抓丁阴谋
    号召边沿区蒋占区有志男儿武装自卫
    豫北青壮不给蒋贼当炮灰络绎来我区
    【本报邯郸十八日电】为反对蒋介石抓捕解放区青年，反对武装特务“还乡团”的到处破坏活动，晋冀鲁豫中央局宣传部、军区政治部，特联合指示各地，根据当地自卫斗争的具体情况，深入进行反抓丁、反“还乡团”的宣传，广泛涂写标语口号，以激励边区全体军民，提高其保家自卫的热情。关于反抓丁宣传方面，应特别指出蒋介石兵力不足，损兵折将三十五个旅，到解放区抓捕青年壮丁，屠杀解放区同胞，给蒋美反动派当炮灰的阴谋。应号召边沿区蒋占区的有志男儿武装起来打游击，积极反对蒋介石抓丁，保护自己的翻身利益。对被蒋军抓去的青年，应号召他们携枪逃跑，回到解放区来，民主政府应特别加以奖励优待。对于帮助蒋军抓丁的分子，八路军和人民一定要坚决予以镇压！对于武装特务“还乡团”，要尽量揭发其杀人、抓丁、抢粮的各种罪恶，号召全区军民，坚决消灭他们；对其中的胁从分子，应号召他们立即悔过自新，放下武器，民主政府当不咎既往。对逃亡地主，只要他不破坏解放区，民主政府欢迎他们回来，并照顾他们的生活。
    【本报长治十八日电】蒋军在豫北占领区疯狂抓丁，遇到老乡便以做工当小夫为名赶回据点，捕往团队当兵。闻蒋军在修武、博爱、沁阳、武陟各县，最近计划每县征丁千余名。据沁阳万善战斗中蒋军俘虏说：“新抓去的壮丁吃不饱饭，蒋伪怕他们逃跑，常进行恐吓说：“跑了杀全家”，但在其换防时，还有许多人乘机逃跑。”
    【本报长治十八日电】辉县蒋伪疯狂抓丁，顽县长关朝彦颁发强征壮丁令（每大保征丁十六名至二十名、小保十名至十四名），因之一到夜晚，蒋占区村庄，鸡犬不宁，人心惶惶，户户不安，各村青年壮丁，纷纷逃来我解放区。连保长也因无法应付，黑夜不敢在家睡觉。某顽镇公所到处花钱买丁，但一无所获，遂于八日晚率顽保安团包围南云门村，抓走数十青年。一青年因拒抓，当场遭惨杀。又据新乡蒋管区逃来青年谈称：该地未能逃出青年，均用花椒水洗肿睾丸，不能行动，并用刀剁去二姆手指。民主政府对此极为关怀，除张贴布告号召蒋占区青年逃来解放区外，并在该县扬吕川、城关、七、八、九等区设立招待所，安置逃来青年之生活。
