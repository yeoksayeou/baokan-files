The angle formed by the central section of the Longhai Railway and the northern section of the Jinpu Railway includes eleven counties in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Shandong, and Henan. Since late August, the local people have begun a region-wide self-defense counterattack to resist Chiang Kai-shek's invading troops. The people of Su, Lu, and Yu swallowed their tears in this new disaster, once again engaging in a firm and tenacious struggle.

　　The leaflets scattered from Chiang's airplanes were filled with beautiful phrases such as "Reduce rent and interest, implement land to the tillers," but the bloody reality tore through all shameless lies. Those special agents and despots who had been liquidated by the people (the so-called "Returning Home Corps"), those feudal rulers and bloodsucking demons, came back with the invading troops, swaggering as district and township chiefs. They patrolled the villages every day with short guns, arresting peasants and threatening their families, saying: "As long as you pay off the rent and old debts, spit out what you have 'eaten,' and hand over the head of the family, and then 'repent' to the government, you will be fine; otherwise, you will be expelled." More than 50,000 family members were driven out in this way, and more than 10,000 peasants were arrested and sent to the county towns. These people were sent to so-called "training classes," which were actually slaughterhouses. Liu Zhaofu, a veteran traitor and special agent boss in Fengxian County, personally presided over the "training class." He told the peasants at the beginning: "We will not punish you, but if someone reports you within three days, then it's not guaranteed." These special agents carried out live burials and public executions under the guise of "training" and "reporting." Within just one month, more than 1,000 innocent peasants were brutally murdered in Fengxian County, and more than 500 were buried alive or shot within ten miles around the city. For example, the young peasant Bai Gezi and his sister from Lihe Village in the northwest of the city were buried alive in the same pit.

　　After the brutal massacre, a frenzied "village cleansing" followed. The peasants could no longer endure it and were forced to take up arms to defend their parents, wives, children, land, houses, and property. In Pei County alone, 5,000 peasants took up steel guns and fought desperately against the Chiang and puppet troops. After Chiang's direct line 11th Division occupied Pei County, they could not leave the city for two weeks. In total, about 15,000 well-armed peasants in eleven counties were engaged in a life-and-death struggle with Chiang's troops. Even if Chiang's troops ventured out of the city in groups of three to five hundred, they were driven back by the militia.

　　Chiang's troops, enraged by their failures, plotted a bloody revenge. On the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival, Chiang's troops concentrated the puppet security regiments from Pei County, Feng County, and Yutai County, along with a regular brigade, and in coordination with the "Returning Home Corps" from each county, carried out a large-scale massacre of the people of Pei County. It was a dark and stormy night. The peasants resisted, moving their families and fighting as they retreated. By dawn, a contingent of nearly 15,000 people had retreated to the west bank of Zhaoyang Lake. The vicious Chiang and puppet troops wanted to wipe out all the people here. After two days and two nights of marching, the people were exhausted, and the pursuing Chiang and puppet troops were gradually closing in, especially the peasants who were moving north to Liu Puzhuang northeast of Pei County, who had to retreat from the lake to the east of the lake. However, there were no boats on the twenty-mile stretch of water, making it impossible to cross. They faced only two paths: resistance or death. The peasants chose the former without hesitation. District Chief Gao of the democratic government and Hu Tingzhen of the Military Committee stood firmly with the peasants, set up machine guns and small cannons, and concentrated rifles to shoot at the attacking Chiang and puppet troops, covering the evacuation of families, the elderly, and the weak into the water. Some rolled into the puddles, others were injured by fishing hooks, and mortar shells flew over their heads. They stood in the lake and declared with grief and anger: "Wherever our democratic government goes, we will follow! We will live together and die together!"

　　The attacking Chiang and puppet troops began to retreat under the resolute resistance of the peasants. Zhao Daosheng, the district chief of Fengtun, went to the lake to mobilize fishing boats, first ferrying the elderly, weak, women, and children across the water, and then the young and strong controlled the waterway and gradually transferred, successfully reaching the east side of the lake. The democratic government on the east side of the lake immediately dried their clothes, cooked them food, and sent 300,000 yuan in consolation money to help them settle down.

　　The young and strong peasants who had retreated to the east side of the lake were unwilling to see their land occupied by Chiang and puppet troops for a long time. After recovering from their fatigue, they bravely returned to the west side of the lake and, in combination with the peasants who had newly taken up arms locally, launched a wider guerrilla war. Like a prairie fire, the people of the eleven counties of Su, Lu, and Yu are now taking up guns with grief and anger, and are engaging in a desperate struggle with the invading Chiang and puppet troops.

　　苏鲁豫人民在斗争中
    方德
    陇海中段和津浦北段这两条铁路的夹角中，包括了苏鲁豫三省的十一个县，当地人民自八月下旬以来就开始了全区的自卫反击战抵抗蒋介石进犯军。苏鲁豫人民在这新的灾难中吞下了眼泪，再一次作着坚定顽强的苦斗。
    天上蒋记飞机散的传单写着“要减租减息，实行耕者有其田”等漂亮的词句，但是血腥的事实撕破了一切无耻的谎言；那些被人民清算了的特务恶霸，（即所谓“还乡团”）那些封建统治者和吸血魔王，又跟随进犯军卷土重来，又得意洋洋地成了区乡镇长，每天拿着短枪在村里逮捕农民，威胁农民家属说：“只要把租子和旧债交清，把‘吃下’的东西吐出来，把当家的交出来，自己再向政府‘悔过’就没有事，要不就驱逐出境。”这样被撵出来的家属在五万以上，被逮捕到各县城里的农民也在万人以上，把这些人送进所谓“训练班”，实际上是赶入屠场。丰县老牌汉奸特务头子刘兆富亲自主持“训练班”，他一开始就向农民说：“我们对你们不加罪，不过三天以内有人告发，那就不保险了。”这些特务们就在“调训”和“告发”的名义下进行活埋和公开枪毙，短短一个月内，在丰县城内就有一千多善良的农民惨遭屠杀，城周十里以内活埋及枪毙的达五百多，如城西北李河村的青年农民白鸽子和他的妹妹就被同时活埋在一个坑里。
    在凶残的屠杀之后，接着就进行疯狂的“清乡”，农民们不能再忍受了，被迫纷纷拿起武器来，保卫自己的父母妻子和土地房产，仅在沛县就有五千农民拿起钢枪和蒋伪军拚命。当蒋军嫡系十一师侵占沛县之后，两周内出不了城，总计十一县共约有一万五千多武装整齐的农民与蒋军作生死搏斗争，即使蒋军三五百人结队闯出城来，都被民兵打了回去。
    蒋军恼羞成怒，就安排下了血腥的报复的阴谋。中秋之夜，蒋军集中了沛县、丰县、鱼台三县的伪保安团和一个正规旅的兵力，配合各县的“还乡团”，向沛县人民进行大屠杀。那是个昏黑的风雨之夜。农民们抵抗着，携着家眷转移，且战且走，待到天明，将近一万五千人的队伍退到昭阳湖西岸，狠毒的蒋伪军要把人民全部消灭在这里。两日两夜的行军，人们十分困乏，追击的蒋伪军却逐渐迫近了，特别是北路向沛县东北刘蒲庄转移的农民，只有从湖里向湖东撤退，但二十里长的水面没有船只，无法渡过，他们面前只有两条路：抵抗或是死亡，农民们毫不迟疑的选择了前者。民主政府的高区长和武委会的胡挺祯紧紧地和农民们站在一起，架起机枪，小炮，集中步枪向进攻的蒋伪军射击，掩护家属老弱探着水道向东撤退，有的滚在水坑里了，有的被钓鱼的滚钩钩伤了，迫击炮的炮弹从头上打过来了，他们立在湖心里悲愤地宣誓：“咱们的民主政府走到那里，咱们就跟到那里，活要活在一起，死也要死在一起！”
    进攻的蒋伪军在农民们坚决抵抗之下，开始退缩了。冯屯区区长赵道生去湖里动员来了渔船，把老弱妇孺先渡过水去，然后青壮年才控制水道，逐步转移，胜利的到了湖东。湖东的民主政府马上给他们把衣服烤干，给他们做饭，并送来三十万元慰劳金，帮他们安家。
    撤至湖东的青壮年农民不甘心自己的土地长期被蒋伪军侵占，在恢复疲劳之后，又勇敢的回到湖西，结合当地新拿起武器的农民，开展了更广泛的游击战争。像燎原之火的苏鲁豫十一县的人民，目前正悲愤地拿起枪来，和进犯的蒋伪军去进行殊死的斗争。
