    Anyang Headquarters Calls on Cadres
    to Launch New Heroism Movement
    [This newspaper, Changzhi News] Amidst the drastic changes in the Anyang situation, the Anyang Headquarters specifically calls upon all cadres to sacrifice the small self and strive to be new heroes. The standards are: (1) Those who can lead the militia to persist in the war, or go deep behind enemy lines to carry out guerrilla warfare; (2) Those who lead the militia and stretcher-bearers in the war, can work diligently and conscientiously, and take on a backbone role; (3) Those who obey leadership, carry out orders, and can complete tasks on time. At the same time, it is pointed out that those who attempt to live in ease and escape from the battle, disobey orders and leave their posts without authorization... will be punished by war discipline. Currently, cadres at all levels are striving to be new heroes in their various work positions.
