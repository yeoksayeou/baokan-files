　　Chile

    Chile is a long, narrow country in South America. Its capital, Santiago (population one million, accounting for one-fifth of the country's population), is the fourth largest metropolis in South America. A clear stream flows through it, shaded by trees, making for picturesque scenery that enchants visitors. Its most famous products are two: copper (annual production of over 500,000 tons, exceeding the United States' production in 1939) and sodium nitrate (annual production of 1.5 million tons). These two together account for three-quarters of Chile's total exports. These two industries employ 40,000 workers, and indirectly support 400,000 people, accounting for 8% of the total population. Unfortunately, the copper is controlled by the American financial oligarch Mellon's Anaconda Company, and the sodium nitrate is also under American control. Of the country's approximately 200,000 workers, 50% are already organized, and 60% of the mine workers have joined trade unions. The Communist Party has an overwhelming advantage in the mine workers' unions, as the American magazine *Newsweek* said on July 8th, "Chile has one of the most prosperous and growing communist movements in Latin America, and this electoral victory of the Radical Party and the Communist Party is a major test of the strength of the Chilean Communist Party."
    In 1938, the Communist Party, the Radical Party, and the Socialist Party organized the Popular Front and established a relatively progressive government, carrying out reforms in agriculture and society, known as Chile's "New Deal". Although the labor movement started as early as 1900, it only grew stronger after the Popular Front.
    The Communist Party is the most organized party in Chile. It is said that the number of party members as a proportion of the population is second only to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Its strength and influence in trade unions, especially among miners, is the highest of all parties in the country. In 1945, it held 46,000 votes, becoming a decisive force in the election movement. Therefore, it was no accident that President Videla invited the Chilean Communist Party to join the cabinet this time. The Radical Party is a petty-bourgeois party, but in fact it is related to the big bourgeoisie. It split in 1942, with former President Ríos leaning to the right, while current President Videla has leaped to become a left-wing leader. This time, he was elected because he received the support of the Chilean Communist Party. The Liberal Party represents conservative liberal professionals and businessmen, and some landlords also participate. It is worth pointing out that Truman sent Pétain's friend Admiral Leahy to the country in September (the period when the country was holding elections) to engage in activities, but the result was contrary to what *Newsweek* had expected, and progressive parties gained the advantage.

　　智利
    智利是南美的一个狭长的国家，首都圣地牙哥（人口一百万，占全国人口五分之一），为南美第四个大都市。有一弥清水，流贯其中，树木掩映，风景如画，游人忘返。它最有名的出产有两宗：一个是铜（年产五十余万吨，超过美国一九三九年的产量），一个是硝酸盐（年产千五百万吨），两者共占智利全部出口的四分之三。这两个工业所雇工人达四万，而间接靠它生活的却有四十万，为全人口的百分之八。可惜铜被美国金融寡头梅隆的安那康达公司所操纵，硝酸盐也被在美国控制之下。全国工人约二十余万，已有百分之五十组织起来了，而矿业工人则有百分之六十已参加工会。共产党在矿业工会中占有压倒的优势，正如七月八日美国《新闻周刊》所说的，“智利有一个拉丁美洲中最繁荣滋长的共产主义运动，而这次激进党共产党的选举胜利，正是智共力量的一大考验。”
    在一九三八年，共产党激进党和社会党曾组织人民阵线，并成立比较进步的政府，在农业与社会方面有所改革，有智利“新政”之称。工人运动虽远在一九○○年就已开始，但是壮大成长却是人民阵线以后的事。
    共产党是智利最有组织的党派，据说在人口比例上党员数目仅次于联共，在工会特别是矿工中的力量和影响，为全国各党派之冠。一九四五年，它握有四万六千张选票，成为选举运动中的决定力量，所以这次魏德拉总统邀请智共入阁并不是偶然的。激进党是小资产阶级的政党，但实际上与大资产阶级有关系，一九四二年发生分化，前任总统李乐思右倾，现任总统魏德拉则一跃为左派领袖。此次并因获得智共支持而当选。自由党是代表保守的自由职业围与商人的，也有一些地主参加。值得指出的，是杜鲁门在九月（即该国进行选举的时期）派贝当的好友李海上将去该国活动，但结果出乎美国新闻周刊预料之外，进步的党派占了优势。
