　　Strengthen Joint Defense and Hasten the Production of Stone Mines
    Xiyang Fully Prepares for War
    [This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch] Xiyang county seat and the northern first, fourth, and sixth districts have universally implemented war preparations to prevent Yan's puppet troops from raiding and seizing grain from Pingding. The war preparedness inspection team organized by the county government of this county went to the first, fourth, and sixth districts on the tenth of this month to inspect and found that most of the masses had serious paralysis of thought, thinking that "After eight years of resisting Japan, what can Yan's army do?" Therefore, war preparations were not thorough, and a major discussion on the understanding of the self-defense war was initiated. The masses realized from their experience with the landlords' attempts to counterattack in the mass movement that Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan would not stop attacking the liberated areas in order to maintain their ruling position. The whole county unanimously decided: men and women, old and young, should start working together day and night to quickly hide materials. All villages strictly inspected and reorganized the militia organizations, not allowing a single weapon to be held by unreliable people. They are also rushing to produce stone mines, purchasing guns and hand grenades, strengthening joint defense and intelligence organizations, and carrying out mass anti-traitor activities day and night. All suspicious elements in the village are placed under surveillance. They said, "Spies are the enemy's eyes. If we don't blind the enemy, we will suffer." All villages have fixed contact signals. If one village has something happen, all villages will support it. Now the village militias are studying various guerrilla warfare tactics and mine-laying methods. The masses are generally studying the specific experience of hiding grain.

　　加强联防赶造石雷
    昔阳全面备战
    【本报长治讯】昔阳县城及北部一、四、六区已普遍实施备战，以防平定阎伪之奔袭抢粮。该县县府组织的备战检查团，于本月十日分赴一、四、六区检查，发现大部群众存在严重的麻痹思想，以为“抗战八年熬过日本，阎军算个啥？”因之备战不彻底，乃发起对自卫战认识的大讨论。群众从群运中地主千方百计进行反攻的体验中，认识了蒋介石、阎锡山为维护其统治地位，一定不会停止进攻解放区。全县一致决定：男女老少白天黑夜一齐动手，赶快埋藏物资。各村都严格检查，整顿民兵组织，不让一支武器掌握在不可靠的人手里。并日夜赶造石雷，购买枪枝手榴弹，加强联防和情报组织，开展群众性的反奸。村中可疑分子一律加以监视。他们说：“特务是敌人的眼，不把敌人眼挖瞎，就要吃亏。各村之间都定有联络记号，一村有事，村村支援。现各村民兵正研究游击战的各种战术与埋雷办法。群众则普遍研究藏粮的具体经验。
