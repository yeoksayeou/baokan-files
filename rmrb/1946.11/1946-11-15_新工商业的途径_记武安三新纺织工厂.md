    The Path of New Industry and Commerce
    ——A Record of the Sanxin Textile Factory in Wu'an
    Rong Yinong
    Recently, I visited the Sanxin Textile Factory, run by Mr. Han Xiuli in Nanguan, Wu'an, three times in a row. This factory, from its opening to the present, has only been a month, and it already has a rough scale, and will soon be fully operational.

    The Sanxin Textile Factory is divided into six parts: flower shop, cotton ginning, cotton fluffing, spinning, weaving, and dyeing. At present, the flower shop can purchase at least one to two thousand catties of seed cotton per day; the ginning room has eight cotton gins, which can gin more than one thousand six hundred catties of seed cotton per day; the cotton fluffing room is equipped with donkey-pulled and foot-operated cotton fluffing machines. In terms of spinning and weaving, there is one 12-spindle spinning machine, eight 40-spindle spinning machines, and four iron-wheel machines. The 12-spindle spinning machine has been repaired and is being test-spun, and the four iron-wheel machines will soon be installed. Only the 40-spindle spinning machines are short of parts, and people are currently being sent to Handan and other places to purchase them, and are trying to配制中(fix them). According to Mr. Han, as long as the weaving machine is installed, he will not wait for the spinning machine, and will immediately send people to Guangping and other places to purchase yarn and start weaving; when the cloth is woven, the dyeing workshop will also start work.

    Seeing his own factory being built at a rapid pace, Mr. Han's face was filled with gratitude and joy. He excitedly told the reporter: "I never imagined that the factory could be built so quickly. The government has helped me too much." Yes, how could he not be moved? In the past month or so, the democratic government and mass organizations have not only helped him plan the construction of the factory, actively assisting him in purchasing various machines and parts, but also called on Wu'an Chengguan industrialists and businessmen and the masses to invest 4.37 million yuan (equivalent to 30 million yuan in legal tender) in the factory.

    Although it has not yet been fully operational, the flower shop and cotton fluffing room alone, from the start of operations in mid-September to the end of the month, used just over 2 million yuan in capital to earn a profit of more than 400,000 yuan, with a profit of 20% in just half a month. When the factory is fully operational in the future, the profits will be even greater. Moreover, the market for yarn and cloth in the liberated areas, with the ever-increasing living standards of the vast number of farmers today, is in short supply, and production can be expanded as much as possible without worrying about sales. Therefore, Mr. Han has infinite hope for the future of his factory. He firmly believes that the democratic government's repeated calls for private investment in industry and commerce and the Communist Party's policy of developing new capitalism are a bright road to wealth for the vast number of people and the development of national industry.

    After the visit, Mr. Han happily told the reporter: "Today, to run a factory in the liberated areas, we must adhere to Chairman Mao's spirit of serving the people, and organize the vast number of people to produce, so as to expand the scope of production and increase the income of the factory and the people." Therefore, in addition to its own production, the Sanxin Textile Factory also plans to organize manual cotton fluffing, hand-cranked spinning, and shuttle weaving. In addition to dyeing the cloth produced by the factory, the dyeing workshop also intends to dye cloth for the people, combining factory production with rural handicrafts.

    Under the influence of the rapid construction of the Sanxin Textile Factory and the demonstration of its prosperous prospects, more than a dozen major merchants in Wu'an Chengguan are actively looking for ways to follow this path. This method of operation of the Sanxin Textile Factory will undoubtedly be a new path for the development of emerging industry and commerce in the liberated areas.

    (According to Mr. Han Xiuli, he is a landlord and commercial capitalist in Wu'an. The Sanxin Factory was established by him after the September liquidation movement in Wu'an.)

    新工商业的途径
    ——记武安三新纺织工厂
    荣一农
    最近，我接连到武安南关韩修礼先生举办的三新纺织工厂参观了三次。这个工厂从开办到现在，只有一个月的工夫，已经粗具规模，不久就可全部开工了。
    三新纺织工厂共分花店、轧花、弹花、纺纱、织布、染房等六个部分，现在，花店每日至少可收买一两千斤籽花；轧花房共有轧花机八架，每日可轧籽花一千六百余斤；弹花房则装置有驴拉与脚登的弹花机。纺织方面，共有十二个头的纺纱机一架，四十个头的纺纱机八架和铁轮机四架。十二个头的纺纱机已经修理好，正在试纺，四架铁轮机很快的也就要安好了；只有四十个头的纺纱机因为零件不够，现正派人在邯郸等地收买，并设法配制中。据韩先生谈：只要织布机安好，即不再等纺纱机，马上派人到广平一带收买线子，动手织布；等到织出布来，染房也就要开工了。
    看到了自己的工厂在飞速的建设着，韩先生的脸上充满了感激和愉悦的颜色，他兴奋地对记者说：“工厂建设的如此快，这是我万想不到的。政府帮助我实在是太多了。”是的，他怎么会不感动呢？一个多月来，民主政府和群众团体不仅帮助他计划建设工厂的各项事宜，积极的协助他收买各种机器和零件，还号召武安城关工商业家和群众，向这个工厂投资四百三十七万元（合法币三千万元）。
    虽然现在还没有全部开工，但仅花店和弹花房，从九月中旬开工，到月底结帐时，就以两百多万元的资金，获利四十余万元，半月间利润竟达百分之二十。将来工厂全部开工后，利润当会更大些。而解放区的纱、布市场，在今天广大农民生活日益上升的情况下，又是供不应求，可以尽量扩大生产而不愁没有销路的。因此，韩先生对他的工厂前途有着无限的希望。他坚决相信民主政府一再号召私人投资工商业和共产党发展新资本主义的政策，是使广大人民发财致富和民族工业发展的一条光明大路。
    参观后，韩先生愉快的告诉记者说：“今天在解放区办工厂，必须本着毛主席为人民服务的精神，组织广大人民生产，这样才能扩大生产范围，增加工厂及人民的收入。”所以三新纺织工厂将来除了自己生产外，还准备组织手工弹花、手摇车纺纱、拉梭机织布等。染房除染本厂的布匹外，还打算给民众染布，把工厂的生产和农村手工业结合起来。
    在三新纺织工厂迅速建设的影响、和繁荣远景的昭示下，武安城关已有十几家大商人正在这个道路上积极想办法。三新纺织工厂的这种经营方法，无疑的，将是解放区新兴工商业发展的一条新途径。                
    （按韩修礼先生系武安地主兼商业资本家，三新工厂是他在武安九月清算运动后建立起来的。）
