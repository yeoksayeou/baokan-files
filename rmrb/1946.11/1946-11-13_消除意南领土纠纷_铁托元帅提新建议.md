    Eliminating the Italian-Yugoslav Territorial Dispute
    Marshal Tito Proposes New Suggestions
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th -- Reuters reported: Marshal Tito and former Deputy Prime Minister of the Italian government and leader of the Italian Communist Party, Ercoli, held talks in Belgrade a few days ago. Ercoli has returned to Rome and announced in Rome on the 7th Marshal Tito's new compromise proposal regarding the Italian peace treaty. The content is as follows: (1) Trieste should still be under Italian jurisdiction, but local autonomy should be guaranteed. (2) Gorizia, the second largest city on the Istrian peninsula, should be assigned to Yugoslavia (according to Ercoli, Yugoslavs are in the majority in that area). (3) The minority Italians who still reside in Yugoslavia should be guaranteed full civil rights and should enjoy the privilege of establishing Italian-language schools and institutions. Italian prisoners still in Yugoslavia should be repatriated immediately. (4) The two countries should conclude a trade agreement, according to which Yugoslavia will supply Italy with timber and other commodities, and Italy will sell industrial products to Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia will accept a large number of Italian immigrants and workers to help Italy solve the problem of urban overcrowding. Mr. Ai said that Yugoslavia is willing to resolve outstanding issues through mutual agreement, rather than maintain endless disputes. The Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party issued a public statement urging the Italian government to consider this new proposal and called on the Italian people to widely support the results of Ercoli's visit to Tito.

    消除意南领土纠纷
    铁托元帅提新建议
    【新华社延安十日电】路透社报导：铁托元帅与意大利政府前副总理意共领袖爱尔科里，曾于日前在贝尔格莱德举行会谈。爱尔科里已返回罗马，并于七日在罗马宣布铁托元帅关于对意和约所提的新妥协建议。其内容如下：（一）的里雅斯特仍归意大利管辖，但应保证该地实行地方自治。（二）伊斯特里亚半岛上之第二大城戈里查应划归南斯拉夫（据爱尔科里称：该地南斯拉夫人占多数）。（三）仍留居于南斯拉夫之少数意大利人，应保证其充分公民权，并应享有建立意大利语学校及机关之特权。仍留在南斯拉夫之意大利囚犯应立即遣送回国。（四）两国应缔结商约，依此商约，南斯拉夫将供给意大利木材及其他商品，而意大利则将工业品售予南国。南斯拉夫将收容大量的意大利移民、工人，以帮助意大利解决城市居民拥挤过剩问题。爱氏称：南斯拉夫愿意以互相协议解决悬案，而不愿保持无休止的纷歧。意共中央为此发表公报，促意政府对该新建议加以考虑，并号召意人民广泛支持爱尔科里访问铁托之结果。
