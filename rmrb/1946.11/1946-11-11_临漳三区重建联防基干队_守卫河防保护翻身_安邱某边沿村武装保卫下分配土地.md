    Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 7th dispatch. A border village in Anqiu County, Luzhong, has combined labor and military affairs to complete land reform. The village militia carries guns to work in the fields during the day, and patrols and conducts guerrilla warfare at night to monitor the Chiang troops on the border. Village cadres and members of the liquidation committee are fully armed, carrying ledgers and abacuses, to liquidate, measure, and distribute land; when encountering a situation, they immediately engage in combat. Chiang's troops harassed them four times, but were repelled each time. The militia also took the initiative to contain the enemy, penetrated deep into the Chiang-occupied area, and captured two members of the Chiang-controlled township office, ensuring the successful completion of land reform. Currently, in the entire village of seventy-six households, each poor peasant household has received an average of more than eight acres of land, and the young and strong have risen up to make mines and prepare guns to defend their land by force. They said: "Chiang Kai-shek wants to smash our rice bowls; we must teach him a lesson with bullets and landmines."
