　　Anyang County Party Committee Holds Emergency Meeting to Actively Carry Out Work Behind Enemy Lines
　　I. Establish Joint Military Defense
　　II. Demolish the Puppet Regime
　　III. Inspire the Morale of the Masses
　　[Report from this newspaper] On the 7th of this month, the Anyang County Party Committee convened a meeting three miles from the front line, braving enemy aircraft strafing and bombing. The meeting decided that from now on, militia forces and local work should advance boldly and vigorously behind enemy lines. It also called on Communist Party members and all non-Party cadres to redouble their initiative and enthusiasm, arm themselves, and be able to lead troops and fight. The resolutions include the following points: I. Strengthen and improve the joint defense organization, break the past working base points, re-establish joint military defense, and form an organic spider web to unite around the district headquarters. The militia will implement partial concentration, defend against and actively attack the enemy, combine to carry out guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines, cooperate with the masses behind enemy lines to catch traitors and secret agents, destroy the puppet regime, strive for and control the two-faced regime, and create panic and chaos among the enemy. II. Strengthen propaganda, promptly publicize the victory of our army, and consolidate the confidence of the masses behind enemy lines in victory. Inspire the masses' will to fight. And carry out anti-traitor education among the masses to prevent Chiang Kai-shek's special agents, landlords, and bullies from carrying out reactionary activities. (Shi Hong)
