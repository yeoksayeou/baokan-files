    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th: Moscow dispatch: On the 7th, participants of the Moscow Soviet's celebration of the October Revolution (representatives of the working people of the Moscow Soviet and party and social organizations of the capital) sent a congratulatory telegram to Stalin, which read in part: "Due to the socialist emulation drive launched in Moscow and other regions, the production plan for one month has now been completed, and we are persistently working to complete the entire year's plan for 1946 ahead of schedule. According to the new Five-Year Plan, substantial funds have been allocated to continue the reconstruction of the capital. The Saratov-Moscow gas pipeline, which was started during the Patriotic War on your suggestion, has been completed. This gas pipeline has increased Moscow's gas supply several times over, thereby improving the living conditions of the working people. Large-scale work in other sectors of Moscow's municipal economy is also underway. The Soviet Union's wise and democratic foreign policy of peace has received the enthusiastic sympathy of all progressive people. All the working people of the Soviet Union warmly approve and support the Soviet delegation's proposal by Molotov at the United Nations General Assembly for "universal arms reduction, prohibition of the manufacture of atomic bombs, and the use of atomic energy for military purposes," and your answers to important questions in international relations. We, representing all the working people of Moscow, assure you that we will unswervingly strive to complete and exceed the new Five-Year Plan."
