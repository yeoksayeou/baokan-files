    【Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 6th】The New Fourth Army leaders recently issued an order to commend the 6th Company of a certain unit in the LianShui defense battle for being a combat model for holding the position with a casualty ratio of one to forty, and called on all units to learn from them. On October 25th, the company steadfastly defended the south levee of LianShui city all day, repelling three fierce attacks by the 192nd Brigade of the 28th Division of Chiang's army, killing and wounding more than 150 of them. The New Fourth Army only gloriously sacrificed one person. During the three-day battle, the entire team was firm and composed. Liu Xianglin of the second squad killed two Chiang soldiers with three shots. Li Jinde of the sixth squad jumped out of the trenches and fired during the fierce battle. Xu, the political instructor of the company, personally went to the front line to convey enemy information and conduct political mobilization, and publicly praised the heroic models and sharpshooters on the city wall at any time. Li, the deputy political commissar of the detachment, called for carrying forward the glorious tradition of heroic combat, and the soldiers always maintained a high level of combat morale, and finally won a brilliant victory.
