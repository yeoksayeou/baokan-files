How to Carry Out Land Reform in Border Areas
—Working Experience in Taixing, Central China
Chen Zhong

In Xuanbu District of Taixing, out of the 19 townships in the entire district, 12 townships were frequently raided and threatened by Chiang Kai-shek's troops, and land reform was carried out under such guerrilla warfare conditions. Based on the existing materials, the following points of experience are drawn:

First, cadres must have a firm position of serving the people and relying on the masses. Xuanbu District has two obvious examples from two townships. For example, a certain township was located between two strongholds of Chiang Kai-shek's troops, and the environment was very harsh. The local township cadres were a bit timid and hesitant about land reform. When the district sent a working comrade to the township to help with the work, the township head sat on the bed with his head down and said: "The people are afraid of the local bullies and dare not ask for land." However, because the working comrade resolutely relied on the masses, conducted careful investigation and research, and convened small meetings of poor and hired peasants, mobilizing the basic militia to stand guard and patrol, doing it at night when it was not convenient during the day, the task was completed in eight days, and guerrilla groups were established to carry out guerrilla warfare. At the same time, the district also sent a working comrade to another township. After he arrived in that township, he did not closely rely on and mobilize the masses, but completely followed the rumors. He didn't stay long before returning to the central township, saying that the place was remote and there was no way to carry out the work. However, the district committee sent another comrade to the township. This comrade was determined and completed the task in just seven days.

Second, the ideological concerns of the masses in the border areas are greater than those in the central townships, and the forces that undermine land reform are also greater than those in the central townships. Therefore, it is necessary to closely rely on and mobilize the masses to do it themselves. If it is only completed by relying on external forces for a surprise attack, it will still fail. Therefore, activists must be promoted in large numbers, but their composition and history must be carefully examined, and political education must be strengthened so that they can persist in the struggle.

Third, regarding the mobilization of the masses in the border areas, the following tasks generally need to be carried out: 1. Explain the war situation, which is of great importance for understanding our strength and increasing confidence. The masses in the border areas do not understand the situation in all aspects, especially the news of the seven battles and seven victories in Central Jiangsu, and the principles of mobile warfare. After the cadres told the masses the news of the victory in a certain township, the masses happily waved their hands and said, "Comrades, why didn't you tell us these things earlier? We didn't know anything about it!" 2. The situation of the farmers' lives after the land reform in the central areas must be publicized in a planned way. After the masses in a certain township heard about the land reform situation in the central townships, they actively said: "Let's quickly redistribute the autumn grain here, and life will be better when we get the land." 3. Collect rumors and effectively refute them. 4. Before the masses in the border areas are mobilized, the suppression of the Chiang Kai-shek puppet feudal forces is very important. For example, the masses in a certain township said: "We are sure to fight the local tyrants who fled outside, but if Zhang Jiyue (a local intelligence agent) who is hiding at home is not dealt with, we dare not move. He can't hide anything from him in the township." Because Zhang Jiyue was indeed hated by the people, the government arrested him. After that, the masses said: "Let's get him out and get to work, the reactionary's spy has been cut off." Everyone actively checked the fields, and many people got land. 5. Distinguish the nature and use the original organization or re-establish the organization. Some border areas were like central areas before Chiang Kai-shek's troops built strongholds. The organizational structure was complete, so the masses could be mobilized through the original mass organizations. For example, a certain township first established turn-over groups in various mass organizations to carry out ideological preparation, and the work in the whole township was quickly launched. However, some border townships have had no working foundation in the enemy puppet era, and the political power has been controlled by feudal forces. Using the original organization will hinder the progress of the work. For example, when a certain township started work, relying on the old Baowu chiefs to register the fields resulted in serious underreporting, which delayed the progress of the work. Later, the cadres conducted individual visits and investigations among the masses, held small meetings, established turn-over committees, and established peasant associations through these activists, and discovered more activists, so the work was quickly launched. 6. After the land reform in the border areas began, the masses generally reflected: "I want the field and grain, but what if you comrades leave?" This is mainly because the border masses have not realized their own strength. Therefore, in addition to mobilizing the masses to fight guerrilla warfare, it is also proposed: "A bundle of chopsticks is hard, and the poor are of one mind. We are not afraid of Chiang Kai-shek's army. To turn over, everyone must stand up and fight!" This increased the masses' confidence in victory. The people in a certain township said: "What are we afraid of if the poor stand together? How many landlords can there be?" 7. Combine guerrilla warfare with land reform. When land reform is first carried out in the border areas, standing guard, patrolling, grasping and understanding the actions of Chiang Kai-shek's troops, and protecting the venue are very important. However, when the land reform is completed and the masses have obtained actual benefits, they will automatically demand armed protection of the land. As they said: "If you don't do it, you don't do it. It's a way to survive by seeking life in death." Once the guerrilla warfare is launched, the mood of the masses will naturally stabilize.

    如何开展边缘区土地改革
    ——华中泰兴工作经验
    陈中
    泰兴宣堡区全区十九个乡中，有十二个乡经常受到蒋军的袭扰与威胁，而其土地改革就是在这种游击战情形下进行的。兹据现有材料得出下列几点经验：
    第一、干部必须有为人民服务与依靠群众的坚定立场。宣堡区有着两个乡的明显例子，如某乡地处蒋军两个据点之间，环境很恶劣，当地乡干部对土地改革有点畏首畏尾，区里派一个工作同志到该乡帮助工作时，乡长坐在床上低着头说：“老百姓怕恶霸，不敢要田。”但由于该工作同志坚决依靠群众，细细调查研究，召集小型贫雇农会议，发动基干队站岗放哨，白天不好做夜里做，结果八天中完成了任务，并建立了游击小组，开展游击战争。与此同时，区里也派了一个工作同志到另一乡，他到了那乡，没有紧紧依靠及发动群众，而完全跟在谣言后面溜，停脚不久，便又回到中心乡来，说那里偏僻，没有办法开展工作。但区委派了另一个同志到该乡，这个同志下了决心，仅七天就完成了任务。
    第二、边缘区群众的思想顾虑比中心乡要多，破坏土地改革的力量也比中心乡要大，因此必须紧紧依靠及发动群众自己来搞，如仅靠外力来突击完成，还是会落空的。所以积极分子要大量提拔，但要谨慎的审查其成份、历史，并加强政治教育，使能坚持斗争。
    第三、关于发动边缘区群众，一般需要进行下列各项工作：一、解释战争情况，这对认识我们力量，提高信心，有重大关系。边缘区群众对各方面情况，尤其是苏中七战七胜的消息，及运动战的道理一点也不了解，待干部在某乡把胜利消息告诉群众后，群众都高兴的奈着手说：“同志呀，这些事情为什么不早些告诉我们，我们一点也不晓得呀！”二、中心区土地改革后农民生活的情形，须要有计划的进行宣传。某乡的群众听说中心乡的土地改革情形后，就积极的说：“我们这里也快点来倒回秋粮，分到田，日子也就好过了。”三、收集谣言进行有效的驳斥。四、在边缘区群众尚未发动之前，对蒋伪封建势力的镇压是很重要的。如某乡群众说：“逃在外面的土劣我们准同他拼了，但藏在家里的张吉悦（坐地情报）不处理，我们不敢动，乡里什么事情都瞒不住他。”政府因张吉悦确为人民所痛恨，将他逮捕后群众就说：“出劲揪吧，反动派的耳目割掉了。”大家便积极查田，有很多人都获得了土地。五、区别性质，运用原有组织或重新建立组织。某些边缘区在蒋军筑据点前像中心区，这样组织机构是建全的，因此可通过原有群众组织发动群众；如某乡先在各群众团体中成立翻身小组，进行思想酝酿，全乡工作就很快的开展了。但有些边乡在敌伪时代一直没有工作基础，政权也为封建势力所掌握，运用原有组织反而会防碍工作进行；如某乡开始工作时，依靠老保甲长登记田亩，结果短报现象严重，拖延了工作的进行，后由干部在群众中个别访问、调查、开小型会议、成立翻身委员会，并通过这些积极分子成立农联团，发现了更多的积极分子，因此工作遂很快开展。六、边缘区土地改革开始后，群众普遍反映：“田粮我是要的，就是你们同志走了怎么办？”这主要的是边缘群众没有认识到自己的力量。因此除发动群众打游击战外，并提出：“筷子成把硬，穷人一条心，不怕蒋家军，要翻身，大家起来拼！”这样提高了群众胜利信心。某乡老百姓就说：“穷人大家脚站齐了还怕什么，地主能有几个？”七、游击战与土地改革结合。边缘区在刚进行土地改革时，站岗、放哨、掌握了解蒋军行动，保护会场，是很重要的，但到土地改革完成，群众得到了实际利益后，就会自动要求武装保田，诚如他们说：“一不做二不休，死里求生是生路。”游击战一展开，群众情绪也就自然稳定了。
