    Xinhua News Agency, Lüliang Front, 24th: To coordinate the defense of Yan'an and eliminate the military threat to the eastern border of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, the Eighth Route Army on the Lüliang front simultaneously recovered the cities of Yonghe and Daning on the 21st (these two cities are across the river from Yanchuan and Yanchang in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region). The Yan-puppet troops stationed at Huangshantou, Yiquan Town, Gengzhuang, Sangbi Town in Xi County, and Renjiacun, Quting Town in Daning, fled upon hearing the news. After the Eighth Route Army on the Yonghe front cleared the Yan army strongholds outside the city walls on the 20th, it captured Yonghe City in one fell swoop at 3 pm the next day (Yonghe was liberated by the Eighth Route Army last autumn, but was occupied by Yan troops on the 1st of this year). All the Yan army defending the city were annihilated except for twenty who escaped. On the 20th, the Eighth Route Army on the Daning front annihilated the Yan-puppet strongholds ten miles north of the city, and on the afternoon of the 21st, immediately launched a fierce attack on the blockhouses on the northeast and southeast mountains that guarded the city walls. The Yan army, unable to withstand the attack, fled to Ji County at night. The remaining enemies were completely wiped out by dawn on the 22nd, and the city was liberated by the Eighth Route Army. The results of the battle are currently being verified. By this point, the Yan armies stationed in the three counties of Xi, Shilou, and Zhongyang are isolated. The Eighth Route Army on the Lüliang front is continuing to expand its gains.

    Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 24th: Chiang's troops are actively provoking in the Shenmu-Fugu area on the northern front of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. From October 8th to 14th, Chiang's troops repeatedly harassed Hejiagou and other villages in the Shenfu second district and invaded Longweimao, Rennianxian, and other villages in the seventh district. The soldiers and civilians of Shenfu rose up to defend themselves. The security team and militia of the seventh district repelled the invading Chiang's troops three times and flattened the blockhouses at Longweimao and Rennianxian. In the battle to block the invading Chiang's troops at Huangmu＠, the local armed forces of the fifth district killed and wounded nine of them and recovered the villages of Hujiaozi＠ and Xuejiapan. On the morning of the 27th of last month, more than 440 men of the 256th Regiment of the Chiang's army stationed at Qichatan in Jia County launched a joint attack on Hejiagou in Shenfu in several directions. After four hours of fierce fighting, they were repelled.

    Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 24th: The 2nd Regiment of the 38th Division of the Yan army, which occupied Gaoshan Town, ten miles west of Datong, and Kouquan Station, forty miles west of Datong, fled back to Datong City on the 13th and 17th. The Yan-puppet troops who had sneaked into Huairen City also fled to Datong on the 15th. On the morning of the 18th, after 30 minutes of fierce fighting, the Eighth Route Army annihilated a part of the Special Service Battalion of Chu Xichun's unit of the Yan army stationed at the station outside Datong, killing and wounding more than 40 Yan soldiers, capturing 28, and seizing 23 rifles. The entire area from Gaoshan Town to Huairen is now under the control of the Eighth Route Army.
