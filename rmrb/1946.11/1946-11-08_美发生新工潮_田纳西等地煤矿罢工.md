Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, November 5th: Reports indicate that as the strike by sailors and dockworkers on the Pacific Coast continues to stagnate, new strikes have erupted in the United States. With the contract between the government and the coal miners' union expiring on the 1st, 5,700 coal miners began striking on the 2nd, and the strike wave subsequently spread to 42 coal mines in Tennessee, Kentucky, and West Virginia. According to a public notice issued by the Solid Fuels Administration in Washington on the 2nd, bituminous coal production is now 7% lower than last year. The Pacific Coast sailors' strike remains unresolved, as shipowners there refuse to apply the agreement that resolved the Atlantic and Gulf Coast sailors' strike to the Pacific Coast. Harry Bridges, leader of the sailors' and dockworkers' union, declared on the 2nd that if the shipowners do not concede, the dockworkers' strike will continue until next year. The strike by Hawaiian sugar workers belonging to Bridges' union is also ongoing. In addition, the Trans World Airlines pilots' strike has lasted for two weeks and remains unresolved. The only strike recently resolved was that of the hotel employees in Washington, D.C., which lasted for 20 days and ended victoriously on October 31st.

Due to wave after wave of strikes, according to an official US announcement on the 1st, the working time lost in the first nine months of this year has exceeded the total for the entire previous year (statistically, three times the highest record for strikes in history, with 98,200,500 working days lost, and 3,575 strikes and factory closures in the nine months, compared to 3,984 in the entire previous year). According to officials from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, post-war strikes are extremely sharp, and each strike lasts longer. In September, 5 million working days were lost due to labor disputes, whereas in the entire year of 1930, only 3,317,000 working days were lost due to strikes.

　　美发生新工潮
    田纳西等地煤矿罢工
    【新华社延安五日电】据各方报导：当太平洋岸海员及码头工人大罢工继续僵持之际，美国又发生了新的罢工事件。由于政府与煤矿工人工会间的合同已于一日期满，二日即有五千七百煤工开始罢工，继之罢工浪潮即蔓延至田纳西、肯塔基及西佛吉尼亚州四十二个煤矿。据华府固体燃料局二日公告：烟煤生产现已较去年低百分之七。太平洋海员罢工仍未解决，因该处船主拒绝将解决大西洋及墨西哥湾海员罢工的协议适用于太平洋岸。海员及码头工人领袖布立治于二日宣称：如果船主不让步，码头工人罢工将继续至明年。布立治的工会所属的夏威夷糖业工人罢工亦在坚持中。此外，环球航空公司驾驶员罢工已达两周，亦仍未解决。最近唯一获得解决者，为华府旅馆业雇员之罢工，该罢工历时廿日，于上月三十一日胜利结束。
    由于一次又一次的罢工浪潮，据美官方一日公告，今年头九个月间所损失的工作时间已超过去年全年（统计为历史上罢工最高纪录的一年的三倍，为九千八百二十万五千个工作日，九个月中罢工及关厂次数为三千五百七十五次，去年全年为三千九百八十四次）。据劳工统计局官员说，战后罢工极为尖锐，每次罢工时间亦展延更久，在九月份内，由于劳资纠纷而损失之工作日达五百万日，而一九三○年全年因罢工而损失之工作日仅为三百三十一万七千日。
