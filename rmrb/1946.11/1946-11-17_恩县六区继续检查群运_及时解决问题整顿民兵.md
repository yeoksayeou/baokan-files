[This dispatch from Weixian, dated the 10th of this month] Since the En County Sixth District conducted an in-depth inspection last time and discovered problems such as some villages wasting fruits and harming the interests of middle peasants, the leadership immediately grasped and handled the situation according to the circumstances, and continued to conduct in-depth inspections. Cadres who engaged in eating, drinking, and waste were given criticism and education, and serious cases were handed over to the peasant association for handling. The existing fruits were distributed in a timely manner. In villages that damaged the interests of middle peasants, after mobilization, education, and mediation, some villages have begun to return land or property to middle peasants. During the inspection, it was also discovered that in Liu Xizhuang, six out of seven military families had not received their share of the fruits. A cadre meeting was immediately convened to review the situation and supplementary distribution was carried out. After this major inspection in the Sixth District, all villages have generally entered the stage of holding "Think-Think Meetings," "Resolving Knots," implementing citizen registration, removing the labels of "traitor," and reorganizing the militia. In the First District, due to mastering the policy towards middle peasants during the mass movement, the fruits were distributed as they were obtained, and most villages have entered the consolidation phase. In 140 villages, two-thirds of the villages have organized 75% to 80% of the masses, establishing the advantage of the basic masses. In nearly half a month of reorganization and consolidation work, nearly 300 puppet soldiers have removed their "traitor" labels with the help of the masses and joined the peasant association. The district is now generally preparing to elect village representatives.

    恩县六区继续检查群运
    及时解决问题整顿民兵
    【本报威县十日电】恩县六区自上次深入检查，发现有些村浪费果实及伤害中农利益等问题后，领导上即根据情况，分别抓紧处理，并继续深入检查，对吃喝浪费的干部，给予批评教育，严重的交农会处理，现存果实及时分配。损害中农利益的村庄，经动员教育与调解，有些村已开始向中农退交土地或财物。检查中又发现刘犀庄七家军属，有六家没有分到果实，马上召开干部会检讨，并进行补分。六区经过这次大检查后，各村已普遍进入开“想想会”、“解疙瘩”，实行公民登记，摘汉奸帽，整理民兵。一区在大运动中由于掌握了中农政策，果实做到随得随分，多数村庄已步入巩固阶段。一百四十个村庄内，三分之二村庄组织群众达百分之七十五至八十，树立了基本群众的优势。在近半月的整理与巩固工作中，已有近三百多名伪军在群众帮助下摘下了汉奸帽，进入农会。现该区正普遍准备选举村代表。
