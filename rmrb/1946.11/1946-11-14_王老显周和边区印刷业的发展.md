    Wang Laoxian Zhou's fiftieth birthday was enthusiastically celebrated by his fellow workers who have been with him for a long time. They wrote: "His efforts and wisdom are inseparable from every achievement in the publishing industry of the Border Region." The Party branch of Yongxing Printing Company wrote in bright and dazzling characters, "Glory of the Party!" This is truly well-deserved for Comrade Wang Laoxian Zhou, as a people's publisher.

    I remember that in the winter of 1938, the announcement of the first letterpress printing product behind enemy lines—the North China Edition of Xinhua Daily—was posted from southeastern Shanxi all the way to the edge of the Yellow River, and directly into the enemy's strongholds along the Pinghan and Tongpu lines. On New Year's Day, 1939, the quarto-sized North China Xinhua Daily met its readers as scheduled, which greatly excited the military and civilians behind enemy lines. At that time, Comrade Wang Xianzhou was in charge of the printing of this newspaper. Wang was originally a good teacher with rich educational experience, and he was a layman in the publishing and printing industry. However, with a humble attitude of learning, he overcame difficulties under the leadership of the Party and published the North China Xinhua Daily as scheduled. Soon, a major, almost insurmountable difficulty was placed before him. At that time, as a result of letterpress printing, a new set of No. 5 lead type was worn flat! And a newly replaced set of old No. 5 Song typeface was also worn flat! Finally, even the only set of old No. 5 Imitation Song typeface was about to be worn flat! The newspaper printing was blurred, and enthusiastic readers repeatedly wrote to inquire, and even to criticize. However, under the enemy's heavy blockade, this difficulty was almost impossible to break through at that time, and the printing situation was getting worse and worse. At this time, Wang pondered day and night, seeking ways to solve the difficulties. He was "not ashamed to ask," seeking teachers and friends everywhere and studying with the workers. When he heard the old worker Zhang Jiangong talk about the stereotype printing technique outside, he began to experiment with fascination. Many people advised him not to waste his efforts, and even ridiculed him, saying: "Outsider! Outsider!!" When Wang proposed to use other raw materials to replace bark paper and mica powder for making paper plates, some people laughed even harder, saying: "Hum! People don't need to do business anymore!" However, Wang was not discouraged by this, and continued to explore and persist with the spirit he had in the physics and chemistry laboratory in those years. He finally developed his greatest creative talent. On the night of May 23, 1939, his first homemade 16-page paper plate was completed. Then he cast a lead plate and sent it to the editor's office together with the proof sheet. When Comrade He Yun saw it, he was almost excited to the point of "dancing with joy." But some people with conservative ideas were still skeptical about the effectiveness of this paper plate. Just as they were saying, "It's okay to print a small piece, but it won't work on the machine," Wang's homemade lead plate was actually put on the machine, and the brand-new newspaper was printed. For this, Commander-in-Chief Zhu gave Wang spiritual and material rewards. When this kind of paper plate was spread to the Chongqing Xinhua Daily main office by various methods, everyone admired it as a treasure, and it was recognized as a major contribution to the printing industry. Indeed, after this, many emerging printing industries behind enemy lines were able to avoid a major difficulty, and production increased rapidly. Later, the continued development of the homemade paper plate industry, and even the complete elimination of bark paper substitutes, the use of Asahi Kōshi paper and Maobian paper with talc powder instead of mica powder, and the substitution of purely local hemp paper and paste; the elimination of cloth pieces when making plates; the replacement of steel casting plate machines with copper casting plate machines; and even the use of wood or stones to fill the gaps in the iron baking plate machines, were all collective creative processes, but Wang still remained the leader.

    If we were to turn over the printing history of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region, we would see such a piece of material: The title characters of the Ji-Lu-Yu Daily, all the lead characters of the Taiyue Xinhua Daily, and even a part of the lead characters of the Jin-Cha-Ji Daily in the early days, all came from the North China Xinhua Daily factory. This was all thanks to the success of Wang's homemade paper plates, which ensured the quantity and quality of the North China Xinhua Daily and Xinhua Bookstore, and freed up the type-casting furnace with limited output to support the development of other factories.

    After solving the problem of blurred letterpress printing, the problems of paper and ink were raised again. Especially after the enemy occupied Changzhi in July 1939 and implemented the "cage policy," the sources of paper and ink were extremely scarce, but the newspaper had to be published. To this end, Wang spent half a month personally designing, measuring, and supervising the construction until the first hydroelectric paper mill behind enemy lines was completed. By the summer of 1940, the paper produced by Wang's Houzhuang Paper Mill accounted for one-half of the newspaper's total consumption, but the cost was half as low as that of foreign paper. Later, under Wang's active promotion, the folk papermaking industry, which had declined due to war divisions, was revived to serve the printing industry in the Border Region. According to preliminary statistics, this year, indigenous paper accounts for eight-tenths of the ten thousand reams of paper (one thousand sheets per ream) used by the Border Region and the Taihang Xinhua Daily. In order to solve the ink shortage, Wang found gear discs from Japanese automobiles among the spoils of the Xiangtangpu Campaign, fitted them with other parts to make a horsepower-powered ink machine, and used pine soot instead of lampblack (tung oil produced in the south was burned), sesame oil instead of tung oil, and minium extracted from lead ash from potatoes found in the mountains, creating the famous "Xinhua Ink." This ink accounts for three-quarters of the amount used for letterpress printing in the Border Region today, while Taihang and Jinnan use it exclusively. The manufacturing method of this Xinhua Ink was also spread to liberated areas such as Jin-Cha-Ji.

    Paper and ink can be self-reliant, but the disruption of the enemy's "mopping-up" campaigns could not be avoided, and the North China Xinhua Daily at that time was one of the main targets of the enemy's destruction. In those tense years, Wang was responsible for managing the materials. He set up small, hidden warehouses everywhere to minimize the loss of printing equipment. After the anti-"mopping-up" campaign in May 1942, just as the enemy was bragging about having completely destroyed the Xinhua Daily, the machines and materials that Wang and other comrades had carefully hidden were dug out and the newspaper was published as usual. At the same time, he also helped the newly established Yezheng Printing Factory to convert two and a half machines burned by the enemy into a quarto machine. This machine is still working normally in Yongxing Printing Company today. If you pay a little attention, you can see that its rubber rods are all re-matched, and many parts of the machine have been changed. The rotating peach wheel, however, is made of wood inlaid with iron edges.

    In order to better understand this revolutionary elder, I took advantage of a short day to chat with workers and staff cadres in the machine room and in the workers' dormitories. I found that everyone loved Wang so much, talking about everything about him intimately. Zhang Jiuling, a typesetter, said that he used to be most prone to anger and could not get along with anyone, but Wang always patiently persuaded him: "Look, you're angry again! Getting angry doesn't help!" The next time he got angry, he would naturally think of the face of this kind elder, and his bad temper would gradually be overcome. Accountant Li Ying said: When she first came to work at Xinhua Bookstore, she mistakenly thought Wang was Zhao Youen from the General Affairs Section. She would never have thought that this kind elder who personally came to see and ask about them was the general manager. This revolutionary elder's pragmatic and rigorous research spirit has become a widely praised story among workers and cadres. Anyone, big or small, in the printing factory will tell you that Wang's "yellow heart rod" researched from the mountain is brighter than hemp stalks; or that the tomatoes he grows are bigger than those at the production exhibition. This scientific spirit made him proficient in all kinds of problems in the printing business, and he knew them like the back of his hand, so that even the taciturn old Han Jinsheng, a conservative little blacksmith, had to admire Wang, saying: "I am a general! The manager is a marshal!" And under Wang's enlightenment, the blacksmith's mind gradually became active, and he began to learn and master scientific repair methods. Regarding the attitude towards revolutionary work, Wang also has his own motto: "Not afraid of small jobs, only afraid of not doing them well." Therefore, at the beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japan, as a middle school teacher, he was willing to work as a mimeograph operator at the Jinnan Cadre School. In 1944, when most of the cadres in the bookstore were undergoing rectification, no one was proofreading (insisting on working while sick), so he worked as a proofreader in the hot weather, while also taking care of the sick and giving injections, and sometimes even personally going to boil water and cook for the rectification class. This May, in order to publish the People's Daily, he took on the heavy responsibility of organizing Yongxing Printing Company. In order to ensure that the newspaper was published as scheduled, he personally went to Xingtai to buy wood and supervise the construction of the workshop. In order to reduce production costs, he tightened his belt, and did not take cars or ride animals when he went out. He repeatedly instructed everyone: When talking about the advantages, never exaggerate in the slightest. He said that even if he has achieved a little bit in the printing industry, it is the collective result of research under the leadership of the Party and with everyone. When answering questions about the reasons for a certain achievement of his, he only said these two short sentences: "First, don't be afraid of difficulties, second, don't be afraid of difficulties, and third, still don't be afraid of difficulties"! As I conclude this article, let me pay tribute to this "three-not-difficult" elder, and wish him good health!

    王老显周和边区印刷业的发展
    展潮
    王老显周五十大寿之日，和他长期相处的工友们，热诚的为他祝贺，他们写道：“他的心血脑汁，和边区每一个出版业上的成就是分不开的”。永兴印刷公司党的支部，则以显亮耀目的字体写着“党之光荣”！这对于作为人民出版家的王老显周同志来说，确是受之无愧的。
    记得，一九三八年冬天，敌人后方第一张铅印品——新华日报华北版的启事，从晋东南一直贴到黄河边，直贴到平汉、同蒲沿线敌人的据点里；一九三九年元旦日，四开版的华北新华日报如期和读者见面了，这大大的兴奋了敌后的军民。当时主持这张报纸印刷事宜的，正是王显周同志。王老本是一位具有丰富教育经验的好教师，他对出版印刷业原是一个门外汉。但他抱着虚心学习的态度，在党的领导下，排除困难如期出版华北新华日报。不久，一个大的、几乎是无法克服的困难，又摆到他面前了。当时由于活版印刷的结果，把一副新五号铅字磨平了！把刚换上的一副老五号宋体字又磨平了！最后，连仅有的一副老五号仿宋体铅字也快要磨平了！报纸印刷模糊不清，热心的读者们，一次次的来信询问，甚至于责备。但是在敌人重重的封锁下，这困难当时几乎是无法突破的，印刷情况是愈来愈恶化了。这时王老日夜思虑，寻求解决困难的门径，他“不耻下问”，到处寻师访友和工友们研究，他听到老工人张建功谈到外边的铸版印刷术，他着迷似的开始试验了。好多人却劝他别枉费功夫，甚至还讥笑他说：“外行！外行！！”当王老提议用别的原料来代替雁皮纸和云母粉打纸版的时候，有些人更笑得合不拢嘴说：“哼！人家都不用做买卖啦！”但王老并不因这而气馁，仍以他当年在理化试验室里的精神，一直摸索着坚持着，他终于发挥了最大的创造才能，一九三九年五月二十三日黑夜，他第一张土造的十六开纸版告成了。接着他又铸了一张铅版，连同大样一齐送到社长室里。当时何云同志见了，几乎兴奋到“手舞足蹈”的程度：而一些思想保守的人却仍怀疑着这种纸版的效能，正说着“打一小片刷刷倒还可以，一上机器就不行啦”的时候，王老的土造铅版竟然上了机器，焕然一新的报纸印出来了。为此，朱总司令曾给予王老以精神及物质上的奖励。当这种纸版被用各种方法传到重庆新华日报总馆的时候，大家都把它当作珍宝来欣赏，公认是印刷界的重大贡献。的确，经过这以后，使许多敌后新兴的印刷业，得以免除一大困难，使生产量迅速增长。后来土造纸版业的继续发展，乃至完全不用雁皮纸代用品的旭光连纸、毛边纸不用云母粉代用品滑石粉、土制云母粉，而代之以纯粹土产的麻纸与浆糊；打版时不用布片；以铜浇版机代替钢浇版机；甚至用木头或石块来顶铁烘版机的缺额，都是集体创造的过程，但王老却仍不失为带头的人。
    假使翻一下晋冀鲁豫边区印刷史的话，我们会看到这样的一段材料：冀鲁豫日报的标题字，太岳新华日报全部铅字，乃至晋察冀日报初期的一部铅字，都是出自华北新华日报工厂。这都是得助于王老土造纸版的成功，它使华北新华日报、新华书店的产量和质量得到保证，腾出那架产量有限的铸字炉，去扶持其他工厂的发展。
    解决了铅印品模糊不清的毛病；纸张和油墨的问题又被提出来了。尤其一九三九年七月敌人占领长治，实行“囚笼政策”后，纸张和油墨的来源奇缺，但报纸却不能不出版。王老为此曾花了半月时间，亲自设计、测量、督工，直至完成了敌后第一个水力造纸厂为止。到四○年夏，王老后庄纸厂出产的纸张，已占报纸全部用量二分之一，成本却比外来的低一倍。以后在王老积极推进下，使因战争分割衰颓下去的民间造纸业重新振作起来，为边区的印刷业服务。据初步统计，今年边区一级和太行新华日报所用的一万块纸（每块一千张）中，土产纸要占十分之八。为了解决油墨困难，王老从向堂铺战役胜利品中，找到日本人汽车的齿盘，配上其他零件配制成一部畜力油墨机，又用松烟代替油烟（南方出产的桐油烧成），麻油代替桐油，从山上寻找到的土豆子，从铅灰中炼出密陀僧，造成有名的“新华油墨”。这种油墨占今天边区铅印品用量的四分之三，太行、冀南则纯粹用此。这种新华油墨的制造法更传播到晋察冀等解放区。
    纸张、油墨可以自力更生，但是敌人“扫荡”摧残的扰乱却无法避免，而当时的华北新华日报更是敌人摧残主要目标之一。在这紧张的岁月里，王老正担当着管理资材的任务，他到处布设着小型的掩蔽的仓库，使印刷器材的损失减少到最低限度。一九四二年五月反“扫荡”后，正当敌人大吹把新华日报全部摧毁的时候，经王老和其他同志悉心掩藏着的机器材料，又被刨挖出来，照常出报。同时他又帮助建立不久的野政印刷厂，把敌人烧毁的两部半机器，改制成一部四开机。这部机器今天仍在永兴印刷公司照常地工作着，只要你稍微留心，便可以看到它的胶杆全是重配的，很多机件的部位都变动过的，而轮转不休的桃轮，却是用铁边镶成的木头。
    为了更好的了解这个革命老人，我利用短促的一天，在机器间，在工人宿舍里，跟工友，跟职员干部们闲撩。我发现每个人都那么热爱着王老，亲切地谈论着他的一切。排字工人张九龄说，自己过去最爱发脾气，跟谁都合不来，可是王老总是很耐心地劝导自己说：“你看，又火了！发脾气不顶事！”再次冒火时，便自然而然想起这位慈祥长者的面容，坏脾气也就逐渐被克服下去了。会计李英说：当她初到新华书店工作时，错把王老当成总务科的赵有恩，她绝不会想到亲自看问她们的这位慈祥长者，就是总经理。这位革命老人实事求是的钻研精神，更成为工人干部们传颂的佳话，你随便遇到印刷厂任何一个大人小孩，他都会告诉你王老的从山上研究出来的“黄心棒”，比麻杆还要亮；或者是他种的西红柿，比生产展览会上的还要大。这种科学的精神，使他精通印刷业务上各种问题，了若指掌，致使思想保守不好说话的小炉匠韩金生老头，也不得不赞叹王老说：“我是将才！掌柜却是个帅才！”并且在王老的开导下，小炉匠的头脑也逐渐活起来了，开始学习掌握科学的修理方法。对于革命工作的态度，王老更有着自己的一句格言：“不怕工作小，只怕干不好。”因此抗战开始的时候，他以一个中学教员，甘心情愿地当晋南干校一名油印员。一九四四年书店大部干部整风，没有人当校对（坚持工作病了），他便在炎热的天气里当校对，同时又兼带给病号看病打针，有时甚至亲自去替整风班烧水作饭。今年五月里为了出版人民日报，他担负起组织永兴印刷公司的重担。为了使报纸如期出版，他亲自去邢台买木料监工把工作房修好，又为了减低生产成本，他节衣缩食，出门不坐汽车也不骑牲口。他不只一次的嘱告大家：说到优点切不可有半点夸张，他说自己在印刷业上，即便有一点点成就，也是在党的领导下和大家研究的集体成果。他在答复询问他某项成绩的原因时，只是这样短短的两句话：“第一不怕困难，第二不怕困难，第三还是不怕困难”！结束此文的时候，让我向这位“三不难”老人致敬，并祝他健壮！
