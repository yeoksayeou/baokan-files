    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 23rd] Frontline battles have broken out in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. Part of the 165th Brigade of Chiang Kai-shek's 29th Army attacked Jianzhuang Town (northwest of Yijun) in the Guanzhong Sub-region of the Border Region on the 20th. The Eighth Route Army fought bravely, capturing 14 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers, including a company commander, killing four, and seizing three machine guns and 72 rifles. After Chiang Kai-shek's troops reinforced and returned to attack, our army shifted its position. In the Longdong area, on the 20th, more than 30 soldiers from a unit of Chiang Kai-shek's New 1st Brigade secretly attacked Luomaguan, southwest of Qingyang, and were repelled by the Eighth Route Army. The Chiang Kai-shek troops fled back to Xifeng Town.
