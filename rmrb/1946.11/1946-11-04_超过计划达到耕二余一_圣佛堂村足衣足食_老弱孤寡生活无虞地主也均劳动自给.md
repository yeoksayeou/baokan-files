[This article was] transmitted by our newspaper's Weixian [Wei County] office on the 24th. After the autumn harvest, in Holy Buddha Hall Village, District 7, Weixian County, labor hero Shi Decai and Farmers' Association Director Geng Lanyu, based on the production direction established this spring, "Don't leave an acre uncultivated, ensure no one goes hungry" as the standard, checked this year's production results. Not only was the plan successfully completed, but it was greatly exceeded, achieving "cultivate two, surplus one." Whether farmers, military dependents, retired veterans, widows and orphans without labor power, or landlords who have been purged, all have achieved a happy life with sufficient food and clothing.

The village currently has 92 households, 2,616 mu of land, and a total grain production of 240,975 jin (large scale). The village has a total population of 278, calculated at a rate of 3 dou (small dou) per month for large and small mouths according to habit, requiring a total of 119,232 jin of grain annually. After deducting 55,720 jin for public grain, there is a net surplus of 66,023 jin, enough to eat for more than half a year. In addition, the surplus profit from sideline production is 273,000 yuan, which can buy 8,040 jin of grain, enough to eat for another month. Women's spinning and weaving generate enough profit to cover clothing expenses.

In the whole village, 12 households, including Shi Decai, achieved "cultivate one, surplus two"; 17 households, including Geng Sicheng, achieved "cultivate one, surplus one"; 15 households, including Zhang Wenyuan, achieved "cultivate two, surplus one"; 17 households, including Chen Jiaqi, achieved "cultivate three, surplus one"; and 29 households, including Zhang Hongwai, had enough to eat. Only one orphan with land but no labor power and Zhang Lijun, a recently reformed drunkard, still lacked grain. The Farmers' Association has decided to solve the living problems of these two from the winter sideline production.

When summarizing production, tenant farmer Lan Bi couldn't stop smiling, saying, "I've farmed for half my life, and I've never harvested so much grain." This year he harvested 1,560 jin of cotton, 1,100 jin of wheat, and 1,300 jin of miscellaneous grains, and after deducting public grain, it is enough for three years of food and clothing. All 38 tenant farmers who turned over, like him, have escaped hunger, with six achieving "cultivate one, surplus two," six achieving "cultivate one, surplus one," four achieving "cultivate three, surplus one," and twelve having enough to eat. Shi Decai said it well: "In the past, I never ate breakfast, only nibbling on two dry cornbread cakes and drinking two bowls of cold water, but now I eat three meals a day."

The village's 20 landlords, after their illegal exploitation was purged, also actively engaged in production and participated in mutual aid, laboring together with the farmers. None of them were unable to make a living. Among them, one household achieved "cultivate one, surplus two," four achieved "cultivate one, surplus one," three achieved "cultivate two, surplus one," four achieved "cultivate three, surplus one," and eight had enough to live on. From this, it can be seen that as long as they implement government decrees and engage in labor, they can still live a prosperous life.

With the enthusiastic help of the villagers, the 15 military dependents and martyrs' families also lived prosperous lives, with one household achieving "cultivate one, surplus one," four achieving "cultivate three, surplus one," and four having enough to maintain their lives. For the six households with no one at home, all income is kept by the village public office. Among the seven honored servicemen and veterans, three achieved "cultivate one, surplus one," one achieved "cultivate three, surplus one," and three had enough to eat. Among the 14 elderly, weak, and orphans, one household achieved "cultivate one, surplus two," three achieved "cultivate one, surplus one," four achieved "cultivate two, surplus one," two achieved "cultivate three, surplus one," and three had enough to eat.

The masses of Holy Buddha Hall do not waste because they have achieved a prosperous life of "cultivate two, surplus one." They still maintain the excellent traditions of hard work and thrift. Shi Decai, who harvested 6,400 jin of grain, still eats red sorghum cornbread, and Geng Lanyu rarely spends money except to buy some salt. He felt heartache like losing a piece of flesh when he ate two jin of steamed buns during his illness, but he donated more money than anyone else in the village in the labor support for the front line movement.

Now, in order to better develop their household affairs, they have formulated a production plan for this winter, aiming to ensure that there are no idle people during the slack winter season. Women's organizations will form weaving groups to prepare clothes, shoes, and socks for next year and earn enough cloth for single-layer clothing for the whole village. Men will engage in making tofu, opening flour mills, ginning cotton, steaming buns, opening butcher shops, and selling pigs and sheep. They estimate that they can earn at least 400,000 yuan.

　　超过计划达到耕二余一
    圣佛堂村足衣足食
    老弱孤寡生活无虞地主也均劳动自给
    【本报威县二十四日电】秋收过后，威县七区圣佛堂村劳动英雄石德才、农会主任耿兰玉，根据今春确定的生产方向“不荒一亩地，做到不挨饿”为标准，检查今年生产结果，不但胜利完成，并且大大超过了预定计划，达到了耕二余一。不论农民、军属、荣退军人、无劳动力的鳏寡孤独、被清算后的地主，皆达到足衣足食的幸福生活。该村现有九十二户，土地二千六百十六亩，共产粮食二十四万零九百七十五斤（大秤），全村共有二百七十八口人，以大口小口每月三斗（小斗）的习惯计算，全年共需粮食十一万九千二百三十二斤，再除去公粮五万五千七百二十斤，净余粮六万六千零二十三斤，可供食用半年有余。此外，副业生产余利二十七万三千元，可买八千零四十斤粮食，又足供吃一月。妇女纺织则做到盈利已够穿。全村做到耕一余二者有石德才等十二户，耕一余一者有耿思成等十七户，耕二余一者有张文元等十五户，耕三余一者有陈甲其等十七户，足够食用者有张洪外等二十九户；尚缺少许粮食者，仅有一个有地无劳动力的孤儿，和一个刚经改造的酒徒张立俊。对此二人生活，农会已决定从冬季副业生产中予以解决。总结生产时佃户兰毕闭不住嘴的笑着说：“种了半辈子地，没打过这多粮食。”他今年收了一五六○斤棉花，一一○○斤麦子，一三○○斤杂粮，除去公粮足够三年吃穿。像他这样的三十八户翻了身的佃农均已摆脱饥饿。做到耕一余二的六家，耕一余一的六家，耕三余一的四家，足够吃的十二家。石德才说得好：“我过去上午没吃过饭，只啃两块干窝窝，喝两碗冷水，现在也吃上三顿饭了。”该村二十户地主，在他们的非法剥削被清算后，也积极从事生产，并参加了互助，和农民一起劳动，其中没有一个不能生活的。他们之中，耕一余二者一家，耕一余一者四家，耕二余一者三家，耕三余一者四家，足够生活者八家。由此可知，他们只要执行政府法令，从事劳动，仍然可以过富裕生活，十五家军属、烈属，在村民热烈代耕帮助下，生活也富裕了，其中一户达到了耕一余一，四户达到耕三余一，四户足够维持生活。还有六户因家中无人，所有收入皆由村公所负责保存。在七个荣誉军人和退伍军人中，做到耕一余一者三人，耕三余一者一人，足可供食者三人。在十四户老弱孤寡中，耕一余二者一家，耕一余一者三家，耕二余一者四家，耕三余一者二家，足供食用者三家。圣佛堂的群众并不因达到耕二余一的富裕生活而浪费，他们仍保持着刻苦勤俭的优良传统。石德才收了六千四百斤粮食，仍吃着红高粱窝窝，耿兰玉除了买点盐外，也极少花钱，病中吃了二斤馍，像割了肉一样的心痛，但在支援前线的劳军运动中，他献金比全村任何人都多。现在，他们为了更好的发展自己的家务，已订出了今年冬季的生产计划，要做到冬闲期间没闲人，妇女组织纺织组，把明年的衣服鞋袜都做妥当，赚出全村的单衣布。男人从事推豆腐、开粉坊、轧花、蒸馍、开肉铺、贩猪羊等，他们预计最低可赚洋四十万元。
