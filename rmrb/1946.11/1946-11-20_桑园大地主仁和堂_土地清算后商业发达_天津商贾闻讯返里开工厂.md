Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 14th: Renhetang, the large landlord and commercial capitalist of Sangyuan Town, Wuqiao County, Bohai District, is the financier of the famous Jinghu (Beijing-Shanghai) commercial firm Shuangheyi, and owns 50 to 60 *qing* of land. During the land reform, after the land portion was returned to the tenants, its commercial operations were not only fully preserved, but also became more prosperous than before due to improved living standards and increased purchasing power of the peasants. Wang Yinrong, manager of Rongcheng Cigarette Cooperative, and Yang Jiabin, deputy manager of Hengfeng Hotel, returned from Tianjin to Sangyuan Town one after another to reorganize their businesses upon hearing the news. Wang Yinrong originally established Hengchang Firm in Tianjin, but due to the Kuomintang authorities' overt levies and covert exactions, he lost more than 10 million *fabi* (Nationalist currency) in less than ten months, and could not maintain the storefront. This time, he has returned to the liberated area and reopened the Rongcheng Cigarette Cooperative. Yang Jiabin is also preparing to resume business. The Desheng Iron Factory, which had been shut down for more than a year, has resumed production and is expanding its operations to establish branch factories.

    土地清算后商业发达
    天津商贾闻讯返里开工厂
    【新华社山东十四日电】渤海区吴桥县桑园镇的大地主兼商业资本家仁和堂，是京沪驰名的大商号双和义的财东，并占有土地五六十顷。在清算中，其土地部分算还佃户外，其所营商业不惟全部保留，且因农民生活改善购买力提高，其营业较前更加发达。荣成卷烟社经理王寅荣、恒丰酒店副经理杨嘉宾等闻讯后，即相继由天津返回桑园镇重整营业。王寅荣原在天津设恒昌商号，因横遭国民党当局明征暗敛，未及十个月竟亏本法币千余万元，门面无法支撑，这次回解放区已重开荣成卷烟社。杨嘉宾亦正在筹备复业。而其停顿年余的德生铁工厂，则已复工并正扩大营业设立分号。
