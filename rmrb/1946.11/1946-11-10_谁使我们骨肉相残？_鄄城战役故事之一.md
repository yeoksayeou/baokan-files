Who Made Us Fight Each Other?
    One Story from the Battle of Juye
    Yong Jin
    On the night of October 31st, the sounds of gunfire ceased. Cheng Jinxue, a soldier of the Fifth Company, heard shouts of "Hand over your guns!" coming from the large bunker, and the accent sounded very familiar. He thought it must be someone from Anhui, but the situation was so urgent that he couldn't think about it any further, and he rushed back into the street!

    After the battle, the prisoners were gathered at the assembly point east of Renzhuang. Cheng Jinxue remembered the accent he heard shouting "Hand over your guns!" from the bunker, and he wanted to inquire about the situation in Anhui. He walked up to the prisoners and asked, "Which one of you is from Anhui?" A prisoner hurriedly stood at attention and replied, "Comrade, I am from Anhui." In the darkness, Cheng Jinxue saw a thin figure with a high-pitched voice, which made him feel even more familiar.

    He rushed over and asked, "Which county are you from?"

    "Comrade, I am from Fengtai."

    Hearing this, Cheng Jinxue's heart beat rapidly. He put his hands on the prisoner's shoulders and recognized him – it was his nephew, Cheng Zhengliang!

    "Ah, it's you!" The two of them gripped each other's hands tightly, unable to speak. They both cried, tears streaming down their faces.

    Ten minutes later, they finally found their voices:

    "Zhengliang, I never expected to see you! It's been two years since you were drafted. My second, third, and fourth brothers have also been drafted. I was drafted into the Thirtieth Army..." In the dim moonlight, Cheng Zhengliang looked at his uncle, thinking of the scene when he was firing at him from the bunker. He felt infinite shame and pain.

    But who exactly forced them to fight each other? Cheng Jinxue continued, "During the Pinghan Campaign last year, our Thirtieth Army attacked the Eighth Route Army on the Pinghan Railway, and as a result, the Thirtieth Army was completely wiped out. I laid down my arms during the battle and joined the Eighth Route Army. The leaders here treat me very well, like a brother. As soon as I arrived, the company commander saw that I wasn't wearing a cotton coat and took off his own to put it on me..."

    "I've been a soldier in the 355th Regiment of the 119th Brigade for four or five years..." Cheng Zhengliang said in a low voice. He couldn't figure out how to express the painful past years. The past was too bleak and sad. One thought kept repeating in his mind: "How could he be my uncle, Cheng Jinxue? Who told me to kill him?" After thinking for a long time, he finally said, "Uncle Jinxue, I'm sorry to you. I understand now that Chiang Kai-shek's conscription and taxes have forced our family apart, our wives and children scattered, and our family ruined. Now I am being forced by them onto the road to ruin."

    When Cheng Jinxue talked about how Chiang Kai-shek had already sold the country to the United States, and that whoever helped Chiang Kai-shek fight the civil war was a traitor, Cheng Zhengliang was filled with hatred. He took off the American hat on his head, tore it into strips of rags, and said lightly, "Good, now I won't wear this traitor's hat anymore!"

　　谁使我们骨肉相残？
    鄄城战役故事之一
    勇进
    十月三十一日的夜里，枪炮声停息了，五连战士程进学听到大地堡里高喊“交枪”的嚷声中，有他很熟悉的口音。他想一定是安徽人，但当时情况那样紧，不容他更多的考虑，他又冲到大街上去了！
    战斗结束后，俘虏都集中到任庄东头的集合场去。程进学又想起刚才地堡里高叫“交枪”的口音，他想打听打听安徽的情形，走到俘虏的跟前问道：“那一个是安徽人？”一个俘虏慌忙立正答道：“同志，我是安徽人。”程进学在黑影里看到一个瘦瘦的个子，说话的声音尖尖的，这使他更加觉得熟悉了。
    他跑过去问道：“你是那一县人？”
    “同志，我是凤台人。”
    听了这话，程进学的心跳的很厉害，他两手搭在俘虏的肩膀上，他认出来了，这就是他的侄儿程正良！
    “呵呀，原来是你呀！”他们俩人紧紧的握着手，一句话也说不出。他们俩个都哭了，热泪滚滚地夺眶而出。
    十分钟以后，才听到他俩的声音：
    “正良，我真想不到会见到你，自从你被抽丁抽走后二年，我也被抽出来了。你二哥、三哥、四哥也都被抓丁抓走了。我被抓到三十军去当兵。……”在灰暗的月光下，程正良向他的叔叔打量着，他想到在地堡里向他开火时的情景，他感到无限的惭愧和痛苦。
    但是到底是谁逼得自己骨肉相残呢？程进学接着说：“到去年平汉战役时，我们三十军在平汉路向八路军进攻，结果三十军被全部消灭了。我在战斗中放下武器，参加了八路军。这里首长们对我非常好，和弟兄一样，我一来到，连长看我还没穿棉衣，就脱下自己的棉衣披在我的身上……。”
    “我在一一九旅三五五团当兵也四五年了……。”程正良低声说。他想不出怎么才能说出这些年来痛心的往事，往事太暗淡和悲凉了。他的脑子里反复着一个思想：“怎么他就是我的叔叔程进学？谁叫我来杀他的呢？”他想了好久，终于说道：“进学叔，我对不起你，我现在才明白了，我们一家人被蒋介石抓兵要税，逼得妻离子散，家破人亡。现在我又被他们逼迫着走向死路。”
    当程进学谈到了蒋介石已经把国家卖给了美国，谁帮蒋介石打内战，谁就是汉奸的时候，程正良恨极了，他摘下头上的美国帽子，撕成了一条条的破布片，轻快的说：“好，这下子可不戴这汉奸帽子啦”！
