Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 31st: Shanghai News: According to Yang Zhichuan, one of the executive directors of the Shanghai Alternate Councilors Association, and others, who spoke to Shanghai reporters at the beginning of the month, the association has received letters from alternate councilors and the public reporting that nearly forty Shanghai councilors are collaborators and traitors. They are currently collecting concrete evidence and preparing to file a lawsuit with the court.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 31st: Nanjing News: He DeKui, the Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Government, was originally a notorious traitor, having served as the Director-General of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Council and an advisor to the puppet Xinwen Bao newspaper. He was impeached by the Kuomintang Political Council in July of this year. However, the Kuomintang authorities dragged their feet for three days, turning a deaf ear and ignoring the matter. Recently, after repeated investigations by various parties, Chiang Kai-shek stepped forward at the beginning of this month to defend He, calling him an "underground worker." At the same time, the Kuomintang Supreme Committee sent a letter to the Political Council on the 11th, refusing to accept the impeachment. Some councilors, upon hearing this, expressed extreme indignation and resolved to collect more evidence and re-submit the impeachment.

　　沪候补参议员四十人是汉奸
    【新华社延安三十一日电】沪讯：据沪市候补参议员联谊会常务理事之一杨志千等月初语沪报记者，该会接获候补参议员及民众投函检举沪市参议员之附逆汉奸人数约近四十人，现正搜集确实证据，准备向法院控诉。
    【新华社延安三十一日电】南京讯：沪市府秘书长何德奎，原为著名汉奸，任伪沪工部局总办及伪新闻报顾问等职，今年七月间被国民党参政会检举，延拖三日，国民党当局一直装聋作哑，不予理会。近经各方一再追究，蒋介石竟于本月初出面为何辩护，称为“地下工作人员”。同时由国方最高委员会于十一日函复参政会，对该会检举拒绝受理。若干参政员闻悉，极表愤慨，决再搜集证据，重新提出检举。
