　　Greeting the Winter Military Training
　　Jinnan Military Headquarters Trains Cadres
　　[Our newspaper, Weixian, 1st dispatch] Military and political cadres from various counties and districts of the Jinnan Military Commission are now gathered at the Military Commission Headquarters, launching an extremely enthusiastic military training movement to greet the winter military training. Every day, as the first light of dawn appears, the sound of grenades whistling through the training ground can be heard. Half of the fifty hand grenades used for training were already destroyed before the training even started. During the military training, many learning models have emerged: Du Xianda, the director of the Fourth District Military Commission of Shen County, was not afraid of getting his new clothes dirty and seized every spare moment to practice bayonet drills, prone shooting, and other movements. The entire team praised him for his proficiency in all areas, his correct posture, and his rapid progress. He inspired others by saying, "We are waiting to train the militia to defend our homes." Xia Xingjin, the deputy director of the Sixth District of Xiajin, not only practiced personally in his spare time but also led others. He copied the key points of each movement into his notebook. He didn't care even when his knees and elbows were swollen while learning prone shooting. He said, "My education is shallow, so I have to practice military skills well." Liu Yin, the director of the Fourth District of Guangping, was fat and clumsy, but he automatically asked the squad leader to teach him after training. He developed two blisters on his hand and sores on his legs while learning to shoot, but he still insisted on running. Shi Fan from Qinghe had sores on his knees, but he still insisted on training. Some comrades advised him to rest, but he rolled up his pants and said, "Don't think that my sores are bleeding; they won't stop me from kneeling to shoot." In cultural learning, they also organized mutual aid groups. Zhao Zhenxiang, who was illiterate, felt sad when he saw others reading the newspaper. Zhang Wenhe, the head of the study group, said, "It's not too late to study hard now." Comrade Sun Yi voluntarily offered to help him, using practical phrases such as "defeat the reactionaries," "let's train," and "learn to teach the militia." He was able to write and use the phrases in two weeks and learned eighty-three new characters. In business research, they discussed how to solve the contradiction between production and training, how to combine training with the central task, and how to make the masses willing to train.

　　迎接冬季大练兵
    冀南武总集训干部
    【本报威县一日电】冀南武委会各县区军政干部，现集中于武委总会，掀起极为热烈的练武运动，以迎接冬季大练兵。每日晨光微明，掷弹声即呼呼掠过操场，五十个教练用的手榴弹，未开学即投坏了一半。练武当中涌现出很多学习模范：莘县四区武委会主任杜宪达不怕新衣沾泥，抓空闲练刺杀卧射等动作，全队称赞，各门精通，姿势正确，进步很快，他启发别人说：“训练民兵自卫保家，等着咱们。”夏津六区副主任夏行进除个人课余操练外，还带领别人，每个动作要领都抄到本子上，学卧射时膝盖小肘都碰肿了也不管。他说：“咱文化浅，要好好练一下军事。”广平四区主任刘寅体胖较笨，下操后自动叫班长教他，学射击时手上磨了两个泡，腿上长着疮，还坚持跑步。清河石燔曾，膝盖上生着疮，仍然坚持操练。有的同志劝他休息，他挽起腿来说：“别看我这疮都流了血，也没误跪射”。在文化学习上，他们还组织了互助组。不识字的赵贞祥看见人家看报就难过。学习组长张文和说：“现在下苦心学习也不晚。”孙毅同志自动提出帮助他，用“打退反动派”、“咱们来练兵”、“学了教民兵”等实用的话，两星期能写能用，学了八十三个生字。在业务研究中，他们讨论了如何解决生产与练兵的矛盾？练兵如何结合中心工作？怎样使群众愿意练等问题。
