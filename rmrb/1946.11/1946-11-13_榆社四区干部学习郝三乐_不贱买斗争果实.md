    Yushe Fourth District Cadres Learn from Hao Sanle
    Don't Cheaply Buy the Fruits of Struggle
    [Our Newspaper] The cadres of the Fourth District of Yushe initiated a movement to learn from Comrade Hao Sanle's wholehearted service to the masses and not to buy the fruits of struggle cheaply. When Comrade Yan Erhuo, Secretary of the Fourth District Party Committee, read in the newspaper that Comrade Hao Sanle had gone deep into Shanghuangcai, a backward village in Yuci, to implement the mass line, enabling the village's peasants to finally achieve liberation; at the same time, he demonstrated a spirit of wholehearted service to the masses in his work, asking for no fruits of struggle for himself (see page two of this newspaper on the 11th of last month), he immediately examined himself, turned over a coat (a fruit of struggle) that he had cheaply bought in Taiqu, and redistributed it to poor peasants. At the same time, Comrade Zhao Zhiyuan, who led the masses in Han Village to achieve liberation, also took out two mattresses that he had cheaply bought for the district office during the movement and returned them to the peasants. They have now launched a movement to learn from Comrade Hao Sanle among the cadres in the Fourth District. At the same time, the county's work bulletin praised Comrade Yan Erhuo's exemplary action in being able to examine his work style in the movement at any time and returning the cheaply bought fruits, and called on all county cadres to learn from him.

    榆社四区干部学习郝三乐
    不贱买斗争果实
    【本报讯】榆社四区干部发起学习郝三乐同志赤心为群众服务不买斗争果实运动。四区区委书记阎二货同志见报载郝三乐同志深入榆次落后村上黄彩，贯彻群众路线，使该村农民终获翻身；同时，工作中更表现了赤心为群众服务的精神，不要丝毫斗争果实后（见上月十一日本报二版），即对照检查了自己，把在台曲贱买到的一件大衣（斗争果实）交出来，重新分给贫苦的农民。同时在韩庄领导群众翻身的赵志元同志，也把在运动中给区公所贱买的两条褥子拿出来退给农民。他们现在已在四区干部中发起学习郝三乐同志的运动。同时，该县的工作快报对阎二货同志能随时检查自己在运动中的作风，退出贱买果实的模范行动加以表扬，并号召全县干部向他学习。
