Xinhua News Agency, Jinji-Luyu General Branch transmits to Commander-in-Chief Gao Jun:

　　On the anniversary of our army's uprising, coinciding with our visit in Yan'an, we are excited and encouraged to offer our congratulations from afar. In addition to my continuous broadcasts for three days, we also held a forum to review and summarize the progress of the troops and individuals over the past year, using concrete facts to celebrate this great anniversary. The Yan'an CPC Central Committee, Northwest Bureau, and Border Region Government also held separate celebrations. Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu personally led high-ranking cadres from the CPC Central Committee to host a banquet for the visiting group, offering awards and commendations. The situation was particularly enthusiastic. Having followed the uprising for a year, looking back on the past and forward to the future, with the experience gained from the visit and the people's enthusiastic support, it further proves the greatness of our righteous act and its suitability to the needs of the people. Now the reactionaries are becoming increasingly rampant, and the civil war is becoming more intense. We are determined to intensify our study, strive for progress, and fight to the end to realize your three major propositions! We respectfully send a telegram of congratulations and wish you good health and all comrades progress!
            Your subordinate Fan Longzhang leads all members of the visiting group in greetings.
                November 1st
