Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 14th: "Mobilize to Defend Yan'an!" Yesterday afternoon at 5 o'clock, a cadre and staff meeting was held in the auditorium of the Shaan-Gan-Ning Border Region government, proposing this slogan of action. More than a thousand cadres attended. Amidst the impassioned atmosphere, Xi Zhongxun of the Northwest Central Bureau of the CCP spoke first. After briefly describing the movements of Chiang Kai-shek's and Hu Zongnan's troops around the Border Region and the excellent conditions for defending the Border Region, he particularly emphasized: "We must organize all manpower and material resources well, achieve close coordination between the front and the rear, subordinate everything to the war, and do everything for the victory of the war of self-defense!" He also called on everyone to maximize the wisdom of the entire Party and the people to defend the Border Region! Every Communist Party member must stand on the forefront of the war of self-defense and not allow Chiang Kai-shek's and Hu Zongnan's troops to encroach on an inch of our land! Chairman Lin of the Border Region government spoke next, pointing out that the meeting was not only a mobilization in thought but also a mobilization in action. Now, the Chinese fascist traitor Chiang Kai-shek has openly torn up the truce agreement and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, invaded the Liberated Areas, and is preparing to attack Yan'an. This has aroused the public indignation of the entire region. He believes that the strength of the military and civilians in the entire Liberated Areas can crush Chiang Kai-shek's military offensive against the Border Region! Chairman Lin called on the military and civilians of the entire Border Region to overcome complacency and quickly transition to a wartime lifestyle, practicing frugality. Government agencies at all levels must adapt to wartime, reduce personnel, and transfer to the countryside and the troops to serve the war. Vice Chairman Li gave three instructions in his speech: "First, everyone must take responsibility, stand at their posts, and resolutely defend the Border Region! Second, every cadre must absolutely obey the orders of superiors to win the victory of the war of self-defense! Third, every cadre must be determined to sacrifice and participate in wartime work with a spirit of regarding death as home!" Finally, Vice Chairman Liu Jingfan gave instructions on the mobilization plan for manpower and material resources of various agencies and how to participate in wartime rescue and other work before the meeting adjourned.

    延安召开干部职员大会
    强调一切服从战争
    林主席号召节衣缩食生活战时化
    【新华社延安十四日电】“动员起来保卫延安”，昨日下午五时边区一级假边参会礼堂召开干部职员大会，提出此行动口号。到会干部千余人，在群情激愤声中，首由中共西北中央局习仲勋讲话，他于简述蒋胡军在边区周围调动情况及保卫边区的优良条件后，特别强调说：“我们一定要将所有的人力物力很好的组织起来，前线与后方密切的取得配合，一切服从战争，一切为着自卫战争的胜利！”他并号召：要尽量的发挥全党与人民的智慧保卫边区！每一个共产党员要站在自卫战争的最前线，不让蒋胡军队侵占我们一寸土地！继由边府林主席讲话，他指出大会不但是在思想上进行动员，而且行动上要进行动员。现在中国法西斯子卖国贼蒋介石公然已撕毁停战协定与政协决议，打进解放区与准备进攻延安，这已激起全区人民的公愤，相信全解放区军民的力量可以粉碎蒋军对边区的进攻！林主席号召全边区军民克服太平观念，迅速转入战时生活，实行节衣缩食。各级政府机构要适合战时，减少人员，转入到农村和部队中，为战争服务。李副主席在讲话中指示三点：“一、大家要负起责任，站在自己岗位上，坚决保卫边区！二、每个干部绝对要服从上级命令，以争取自卫战争的胜利！三、每个干部要抱定牺牲决心，以视死如归的精神参加战时工作！”最后，由刘景范副主席指示关于各机关人力物力动员计划及如何参加战时救护等工作后散会。
