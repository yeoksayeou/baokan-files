　　Liberated Soldiers on the Jilu Yu Front
    Believe Chiang's Army Will Be Defeated
    [This newspaper's front-line reporter team, 21st dispatch] After the Battle of Juancheng, each company of a certain regiment's first battalion immediately threw themselves into intense study. New soldiers, liberated from Chiang's army and joining our army, also enthusiastically discussed the question of "Why Chiang's army is bound to be defeated." Wang Xinjin, liberated from the 3rd Reorganized Division, said: "I am from Hubei. I worked in Chongqing, and the wages I earned were not enough to feed myself. I asked for leave to go back, but I was grabbed and forced to become a soldier halfway. There are too many people like me in Chiang Kai-shek's army. Who wants to fight? Even the veterans are afraid of the civil war. In my platoon, one squad ran away, leaving only four people behind. The second squad lost a whole squad leader, who cried and ran away. Their only method is to forcibly conscript soldiers, which makes everyone resentful. I don't think Chiang Kai-shek can ever win a war." Yang Ziwu, a veteran of Chiang's direct line 11th Division from Sichuan, said: "After eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, we still have to wage a civil war. Anyone who does this is being instigated and deceived by the Americans. Soldiers who understand the situation are unwilling to do it. The Americans never treated us like human beings. Once, an American deliberately ran over and killed our brothers on the highway. Everyone hated it, but no official said a word. The brothers couldn't stand it and wanted to fight the Americans, but the shameless officers still told us to respect our 'allies.' It's like putting on American clothes, taking American guns, and losing the taste of being Chinese. What is this if not being a slave to a foreign country? Anyone with a conscience will not sell their lives for Chiang Kai-shek's American father!" Some soldiers said, "Chiang's army, trained by American officers, can only fight defensive battles. These guys who get beaten, as long as we fight them well, we can't lose." (Written by Zhao Guohua, platoon leader of the unit)

　　冀鲁豫前线被解放战士
    坚信蒋军必败
    【本报前线记者团二十一日电】鄄城之战结束后，某团一营各连，马上又投入紧张的学习生活中。从蒋军中解放过来参加我军的新战士也热烈讨论“蒋军何以必败”的问题。从整三师解放过来的王心金说：“我是湖北人，在重庆做工，挣的工钱不够糊口，告假回去半路就被抓上当兵，像我这样的人，蒋介石队伍里太多了。谁愿打仗？就是老兵也怕内战。我在的那个排里，一个班跑的只掉下四个人，二班光掉下一个班长，他没法哭了一场也跑了。他们的办法只有抓兵，惹的人人怨恨，我看蒋介石永远不能打胜仗。”杨子武是蒋家嫡系十一师的老兵，四川人，他说：“抗战八年后，还要进行内战，谁干这就是受美国人的挑拨欺骗，当兵的只要懂了事，是不甘心的。美国人就没有把我们当成人看待，有一次美国人硬把汽车在公路上压死我们弟兄，大家恨极了，也没听官家说半句话。弟兄们实在看不顺眼，要找美国人打架，不要脸的官长还要告诉我们尊敬“盟友”，这简直是穿上美国衣裳，拿上美国枪，就没有中国人味道了。这不叫亡国奴，叫个啥？只要有良心，谁给蒋介石的美国老子卖命？”有的战士说，美国军官训练的蒋军只能打阵地防御，这些挨打的家伙，只要好好打就没有打不赢的。”（部队排长赵国华写）
