Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st: Chenggong Lake News: The Political and Security Committee of the United Nations General Assembly began discussing the issue of investigating foreign troops yesterday. At the meeting, Molotov spoke first, proposing a new proposal on behalf of the Soviet delegation, namely, the United Nations General Assembly should recommend to the Security Council that ten countries should provide information on foreign troops within their territories within one month. In his speech, Molotov said: "The stationing of British and American troops around the world and in some countries is an act of greed. There is no longer any reason to justify the presence of foreign troops in non-enemy territories, and it will only affect the policies of those governments. The troops of some UN member states have even established a network of naval bases in non-enemy territories, which has aroused legitimate anxiety in world public opinion." Molotov hoped to reach an agreement based on his proposal. This proposal of Molotov's is a slight modification of the previous Soviet position, that is, previously the Soviet Union advocated that the troops to be investigated should be limited to foreign troops in non-enemy countries, and this information should be submitted to the Security Council by the countries with troops stationed in these countries; this proposal expands the scope of the investigation, that is, if the information cannot be submitted by the foreign troops, then the country where the foreign troops are stationed is responsible. This new proposal is roughly the same as what the US side previously advocated. However, when Connaly spoke on behalf of the US after Molotov, in addition to expressing that he did not oppose the Soviet proposal, he also requested that the scope of the investigation be further expanded, requiring not only foreign troops, but also regular national troops to report to the Security Council. British representative Jebb also believed that the Soviet proposal was not enough and should be further expanded. No agreement was reached at the meeting that day.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st: New York News: The Steering Committee of the United Nations General Assembly decided on the 19th that December 11th will be the date of the final meeting of this session of the United Nations General Assembly, and December 5th will be the final date for meetings of various committees.

　　联大讨论调查外国驻军问题
    苏建议扩大调查范围
    美英作贼心虚又横生枝节企图阻梗
    【新华社延安廿一日电】成功湖讯：联合国大会政治安全委员会已于昨日开始讨论苏联所提调查外国驻军问题，会上莫洛托夫首先发言，他以苏联代表团名议提出一新提案，即联合国大会应向安全理事会建议，请求十国应在一个月内供给其本国领土内的外国驻军之情报。莫氏在演说中说：“英美在世界各地及某些国内的驻军乃是一种贪婪的行为，外国事队之驻在非敌国领土，实已再无任何理由可说，而只会影响各该国政府的政策。某些联合国会员国的军队甚至在非敌国领土内建立了海军基地网，这引起了世界舆论的正当的焦虑。”莫氏在演词中，希望能根据他的提案求得协议。莫氏这一提案较前此苏方主张稍有修改，即以前苏方主张应调查之驻军，限于非敌国境内之外国驻军，而此种情报应由驻军于此等国家之内的国家提交安理会；这次提案则扩大调查范围，即不能由外国驻军而提交情报者，则由被外国驻军之国家负责。这一新提案与美方前此所主张者大致相同。但康纳利继莫洛托夫之后代表美方发言时，除了表示并不反对苏方提案外，却又要求把调查范围再行扩大，要求不仅外国驻军，而且本国正规部队也应向安理会报告。英代表贾德干亦认为苏方提案不够，应进一步扩大，是日会上未获协议。
    【新华社延安二十一日电】纽约讯：联合国大会指导委员会，于十九日决定十二月十一日为本届联合国大会最后集会日期，十二月五日为各委员会会议之最后日期。
