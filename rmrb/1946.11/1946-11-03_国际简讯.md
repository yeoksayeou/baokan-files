    TASS reports: American newspapers point out that the issue of trusteeship has caused great anxiety among the American delegation attending the United Nations General Assembly. The Chicago Sun states: The American delegation is trying to obtain "the right to open the doors of British mandated territories." In other words, to place these places under joint trusteeship. However, this position of the US delegation is deeply implicated by the fact that the US Army and Navy Departments refuse to hand over the Caroline and Marshall Islands, formerly under Japanese mandate, to the UN for trusteeship, as these places are now being used as military bases by the US armed forces. A Chicago Sun observer predicts that this situation will put the US delegation in an ambiguous position at the General Assembly. It is now clear that the trusteeship issue will be an important task of the General Assembly.
    Agence France-Presse, Washington, 30th, reports: "An American atomic bomb scientist said today that the Soviet Union does not need the assistance of the American scientific community in its research on atomic energy and will soon invent the atomic bomb."
    According to the US Information Service, Washington, 27th: The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that US retail food prices have risen by 17.6 percent from mid-June to mid-September. The Bureau also pointed out that this figure does not yet reflect the impact of the lifting of meat price controls in October. On September 17, the food price index was 174.1 based on the 1935-37 average, up 54 percent from a year ago and 86.2 percent from August 1938. The percentage increase in prices far exceeds the percentage increase in wages, which shows that the real wages of millions of consumers have decreased and their living standards have fallen.

    塔斯社报导：美国报纸指出托管制问题已引起了出席联合国大会美国代表团的极大焦急。芝加哥太阳报称：美国代表团正力图取得“打开英国委任统治地门户之权”。换句话说，将这些地方转置于联合托管之下。但美代表团这种立场深为下列事实所牵累，即美国陆海军部拒绝将前日本委任统治下加罗林及马绍尔群岛等交给联合国托管，这些地方现在已为美国武装部队当作军事基地使用。芝加哥太阳报视察家预料这种情形将使美代表团在大会上处于暖昧的地位。现在已经明显看出托管制问题将是大会的重要工作。
    法国新闻处华盛顿三十日电称：“美国原子弹科学家某氏本日称：苏联对原子能之研究工作无需乎美国科学界协助，不久即可发明原子炸弹。”
    据美新闻处华府二十七日讯：劳工统计局报告，自六月中旬至九月中旬美粮食零售价格已上涨百分之十七点六。该局并指出这一数字尚未显示十月解除肉价管制令之影响。九月十七日，粮食价格指数为一九三五至三七年平均数为一七四点一，较一年前上涨百分之五十四，较一九三八年八月份上涨百分之八十六点二。按物价上涨之百分数远超过增加工资的百分数，这说明千百万消费者的实际工资降低，生活水平跌落。
