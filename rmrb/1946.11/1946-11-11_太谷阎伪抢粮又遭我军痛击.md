    【This Newspaper, Taihang, 8th】On the morning of the 4th, over 300 men of the 23rd Regiment of Yan's puppet security forces in Rencun, Taigu, attempted to loot grain in the Fancun area. Near Dongjiacun (both south of Taigu), they were ambushed by a unit of the Taigu Independent Battalion. After half an hour of fierce fighting, Yan's puppet troops abandoned seven corpses and fled in panic. It is estimated that over 20 of Yan's puppet troops were killed or wounded, and 19 were captured. We seized two light machine guns, two small cannons, over twenty rifles, and thousands of rounds of ammunition. We suffered no casualties.
