    (Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 14th) Under the call to defend the border region, the military and civilians of the entire Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region have been universally mobilized. After a month of reorganization and training, the border region troops have begun new training. Model soldier Zhang Zhiguo and Four-Strong Hero Ma Shixiang proposed a training competition. The training content of each unit has shifted from focusing on technology to focusing on tactics; live combat exercises are conducted day and night in the troops' camps. After the farmers of the border region rushed to harvest nearly one million shi of refined grain, they began universal training for hundreds of thousands of militiamen. After Yan'an County completed the rush harvest of 490,000 mu of autumn fields in 20 days, they universally practiced martial arts, and many people began practicing martial arts during the autumn harvest. The masses in the border areas have further strengthened the combination of labor and martial arts. In the upsurge of martial arts practice, in addition to practicing bayonet drills and grenade throwing, the masses have made special efforts to master landmines, and all sub-districts have held large and small explosion training classes. The militia of Mizhi has learned the technology of making iron mines, copper mines, stone mines, magnetic mines, and using hand grenades to modify landmines. The Zizhou militia has even invented technologies such as using bullet heads to make detonators, burying flying mines, and burying water mines. Counties such as Zhidan have also rehearsed landmine warfare. The guns bought back by the masses in the Sanbian sub-district have armed several companies. The stretcher teams in various counties are automatically tearing their quilts and using the sheets to make cloth canopies. Hundreds of stretchers in Guanzhong all have cloth canopies and kettles. The masses have also automatically organized transportation teams with thousands of livestock. Women, in the midst of the intense autumn harvest season, still find time to make military shoes. The Border Government's call for tens of thousands of pairs of shoes was completed in less than a month. In Yan'an County, women made 3,500 pairs of shoes for supporting the army in ten days. Heroic deeds of sending sons and husbands to join the army and brothers competing to join the army are happening in every district and township in the border region. In just half a month, the number of people who voluntarily joined local corps and guerrillas has exceeded several thousand. Starting from the beginning of this month, farmers in various places have also simultaneously launched a campaign to deliver public grain, and the masses in the suburbs of Yan'an City have delivered grain ahead of schedule. To cooperate with the farmers' martial arts practice, blacksmith shops in various places are rushing to make spears and broadswords overnight. The blacksmith shop in the ninth group of the new market in Yan'an City has rushed to make more than a thousand foot-long trouser knives; the spearheads in Wu Manyou Township have been completely replaced with these pig-slaughtering trouser knives. The Zhangjiapan blacksmith shop in Dingbian has also reduced the price of spears from 20,000 yuan to 12,000 yuan each. A certain military factory in the border region completed its annual production plan three months ahead of schedule at the end of September. Labor hero Zhao Zhankui called on "workers to produce more weapons to eliminate more enemies" at the Double Tenth Festival commemoration meeting in the military factory! The factory workers immediately voluntarily proposed to work twelve hours a day. The money donated by the factory workers to the front line in this month, according to the statistics of several factories near Yan'an alone, is nearly 30 million yuan. Merchants in the border region have also strengthened self-defense military training and organized a guard team to cooperate with the Public Security Bureau to maintain law and order. One day, hearing that a special agent had secretly come to Yan'an City from Zhenchuanbao, the Public Security Bureau notified the citizens of the new market, and the citizens cleared out this special agent that night. Five merchants in the new market, including Yunhe Store, have proposed to pay business tax, and the Women's Cooperative has set an example by voluntarily paying an additional 100,000 yuan. As for various schools and institutions, middle schools in Yan'an and other places have organized student self-defense forces to practice mountain climbing, grenade throwing, and night study; students from Sui Normal School, in addition to martial arts practice, have also organized three work groups to go to the countryside. In terms of living standards, all institutions have lowered their living standards. The small stove in the Northwest Bureau has been reduced to a medium stove, and the medium stove has been abolished. Senior cadres of the Joint Logistics Department do not wear foreign cloth cotton clothes; the Yan'an county-level institutions have proposed a winter economy plan of more than 28 million yuan. The military and civilians of the entire border region unanimously believe that the border region, which has been tempered by more than ten years of revolution, will surely be victorious! Invaders will find their own graves here!
