　　Matian Elementary School Self-Sufficient in Firewood

　　[Another Dispatch] In order to solve the winter firewood shortage, all teachers and students of the Matian private elementary school in Zuoquan collectively gathered firewood for three days. During the firewood gathering, students were divided into three grades according to their labor strength: first grade, 11 people, 250 catties each; second grade, 38 people, 200 catties each; third grade, 14 people, 150 catties each. The senior class originally planned to gather 10,450 catties, but actually gathered 11,400 catties, exceeding the original target by 2,450 catties. The junior class of 52 people gathered a total of 7,800 catties. The excess amount is calculated at 5 jiao per catty (market price is 2 yuan per catty), saving more than 40,000 yuan compared to buying firewood. (Lian Qi, Wen Kao)
