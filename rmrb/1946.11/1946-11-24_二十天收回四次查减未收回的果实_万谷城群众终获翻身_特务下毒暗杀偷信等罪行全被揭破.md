　　Twenty Days to Recover the Fruits of Four Rent Reductions That Had Not Been Recovered
    The People of Wangu City Finally Overturn Their Fate
    Special Agents' Crimes of Poisoning, Assassination, and Stealing Letters Are All Exposed
    [This Newspaper's Report] After a fierce rent reduction, liquidation, and anti-espionage movement in the old revolutionary base area of Wangu City in Wu'an, the special agent landlords finally lowered their heads, and the masses began to rise up. This village had undergone four rent reductions during the War of Resistance Against Japan, but the masses did not lift their heads. The special agent landlords used all kinds of tricks and schemes to maintain their bloody feudal rule. In politics, they first bought off the village chief, Kang Qinzhang, and made him join the special agent organization. Then, they bought off or replaced the public security officer, militia squad leader, and women's association chairman with their own people. The entire village administration and mass organizations were serving to maintain feudal rule, so the local bullies and landlords ran rampant. The bully Guo Xinggao rented out land for exorbitant profits and exploited the peasants. During the rent reduction, he took the peasants' land and then had the peasants redeem it at a price. Colluding with bad cadres, he obtained the title of "enlightened gentry," and evaded struggle. Guo Shourong used so-called "old rent" rules. After the peasants had already obtained land rights during the rent reduction, he used the power of the cadres to threaten the peasants to pay him rent, in addition to petty rents and corvée labor. Guo Shourong secretly bribed cadres, using false mortgages, false sales, and false gifts to evade burdens and resist rent reduction. The female landlord Wu Jiuting, using false mortgages, false sales, and pretending to be poor, pretended to be progressive and obtained the position of women's team leader, disrupting work and protecting property. In early October, cadres from the Third Administrative Office, in coordination with cadres from the Seventh District, came to the village. After a thorough and detailed investigation of the masses, they discovered the above problems. First, they detained the special agent landlords and bad cadres. The flames of the masses' suffering and revenge were fiercely ignited. After more than 20 days of liquidation and struggle, the masses recovered the fruits of their labor that had not been recovered in the four rent reductions over the years, and initially managed to turn themselves around. Currently, an anti-espionage movement has been further launched. The tricks of the special agent landlords in buying off village cadres and controlling the village administration have all been exposed. The special agent village chief Kang Qinzhang, in addition to using his power to help local bullies oppress peasants, stopped at nothing, including poisoning and assassination. Comrade Yan, a cadre from a certain unit, was recuperating in the village. Kang Qinzhang instigated the female special agent Li Xue to bring a packet of poison to Comrade Yan's house, pretending to ask about marriage laws, and taking the opportunity to poison him. Fortunately, Comrade Yan had a high degree of political vigilance and was not poisoned. Kang also bought off Comrade Yan's guard to kill Comrade Yan with a black gun, but was unsuccessful. On [omitted date], more than 30 letters to and from cadres that had been detained and secretly read were found in Kang Qinzhang's home, including a letter from Comrade Guo to Comrade Yan, as well as a letter from Comrade Yan to Miao Tianxi in Changzhi. The rest were mostly letters from front-line soldiers to their families and from families to front-line soldiers, in order to confuse the minds of front-line soldiers and their families. The number of other letters that were secretly read and destroyed is unknown. The current movement of liquidation combined with anti-espionage is further deepening. The masses are unanimously shouting that they will not stop until the old roots of the special agent landlords are pulled out.

　　二十天收回四次查减未收回的果实
    万谷城群众终获翻身
    特务下毒暗杀偷信等罪行全被揭破
    【本报讯】武安老区万谷城，经过猛烈的查减清算与反特运动后，特务地主才低了头，群众始翻起身。该村在抗战中，曾经过四次减租，但群众没抬起头来，特务地主鬼计百出，用尽心机来维持其血腥的封建统治。在政治上，首先是收买了村长康勤章，参加了特务组织，然后将公安员、民兵班长、妇救会主席都收买或换为他们的人，整个村政及群众组织，是在为维持封建统治而服务，所以恶霸地主们横行无忌。恶霸郭兴高租大利剥削农民，减租时下了农民的地，然后又让农民用价赎回，和坏干部一唱一和，取得了“开明士绅”的头衔，逃避了斗争，郭守荣用所谓“老租”的古规，当农民在减租中已获得地权后，借干部之威仍威胁农民给他出租，另加有小租及役租。郭守荣暗地收买干部，假典、假卖、假赠，逃避负担，抵抗减租。女地主武九廷，假典、假卖、假哭穷，装进步捞到了妇女队长的地位，破坏工作，保护财产。十月初，三专署派干部协同七区干部到该村，经过深入群众的细致调查，将以上问题发现后，首先将特务地主及坏干部扣起，群众诉苦复仇的火焰，便猛烈的点起来了，经过二十余天的清算斗争，群众收回了数年来四次减租都未收回的血汗果实，初步得以翻身。目前则进一步展开了反特运动，特务地主收买村干部及掌握村政的鬼把戏，全部反出来了。特务村长康勤章等，除以权力帮助恶霸压榨农民外，下毒暗杀无所不为。某部干部颜同志在该村养病，康勤章即唆使女特务李雪的带毒药一包，去颜同志屋里以问婚姻法令为名，乘机下毒，幸颜同志政治警惕性高，未中毒计。康又收买颜同志警卫员用黑枪打死颜同志，亦未得逞。×日从康勤章家中，搜出被扣留偷看我干部之来往信件三十余封，有郭同志寄颜同志的信，亦有颜同志寄长治苗天喜的信，其余大部是前方战士给家属及家属给前方战士的信件；以惑乱前方战士与家属的心情。其他偷看被毁的是更不知其数。现清算结合反特的运动，在更进一步深入中，群众一致的吼声，非拔了特务地主的老根不歇手。
