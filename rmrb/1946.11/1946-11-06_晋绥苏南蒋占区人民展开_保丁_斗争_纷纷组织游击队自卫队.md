Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 2nd: To make up for their heavy losses, Chiang's troops are frantically conscripting soldiers in the occupied areas. Local people have formed guerrilla forces to launch an anti-conscription struggle. Since late September, Chiang's troops in Nantong and Haimen have kidnapped more than a thousand young farmers and押至to Suzhou and other places. However, the people's resistance is becoming increasingly effective. Chiang's troops are often ambushed by guerrillas when they go out to conscript soldiers. × Tingmao, the division commander of the 57th Division (military reorganization) of Chiang's army entrenched in the Xinpu-Haizhou area, is extremely anxious, so he ordered the Kuomintang Donghai County government to demand 50,000 conscripts. The district and township governments even listed merchants and students as targets for arrest, causing local people to flee to the liberated areas together. On the Xin (pu) Hai (zhou) road, merchants and travelers have disappeared. A township head even arrested an old man in Donghai city, shaved off his beard at the barbershop, and used him as a conscript. Then, he identified the Liu boss of the shop and his son as also qualified and immediately bundled them off to the district office to make up the numbers.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 2nd: The vast number of farmers in southern Sui who have obtained land through liquidation of land rents are carrying out struggles to protect their fields and men in the rear of Fu Zuoyi's occupied areas. Along the Feng (zhen) Liang (cheng) road, the masses in more than 50 villages transported grain to safe areas for burial and moved to mountainous areas to live. The Eighth Route Army guerrillas in the area have increased several times. In a certain place, more than 50 people brought dry food and luggage and personally sent their children to the guerrillas. Liu, the director of a village farmers' association, recovered his cultivated land after liquidation this spring, but it was recently taken back by Fu's army. He sent two sons and a son-in-law to join the Eighth Route Army and mobilized the youth of the whole village to organize a home-guard self-defense force. After the masses in a village south of Fengzhen killed the puppet Jia chief Wang Yi, they joined the Eighth Route Army one after another to defend their hometown.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd: The Chiang regime's conscription tyranny, which feeds the civil war, has aroused popular uprisings. According to the Tianjin Yishibao on October 29, a group of dozens of armed people's uprisings, possessing more than 30 rifles and many grenades, were recently discovered in the Shiguai mountain gully in Baotou County. The unit is composed of residents of Guoyang and other places in Fu's Sa County, who were forced to rise up in righteousness to resist this conscription.
