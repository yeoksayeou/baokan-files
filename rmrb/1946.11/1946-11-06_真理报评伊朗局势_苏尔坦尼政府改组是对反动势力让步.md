Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd: TASS, Moscow: Vladmirov, in an article in Pravda on the Iranian situation, stated: The reorganization of the Sultani government, without including representatives of the Masses Party (or Iranian Party), is a clear concession to reactionary forces. Vladmirov pointed out that "Since Sultani came to power in February of this year, he has implemented important reforms, but these reforms, especially his policy of cooperating with the broad masses of democrats in the country and establishing normal friendly relations with the Soviet Union, have met with opposition from certain Iranians and British individuals. On August 3, the day after the formation of the Iranian cabinet with the participation of representatives of democratic parties, British troops were transferred from India to Iraq and concentrated in Basra on the Iranian border. Subsequently, under the leadership of British agents, there was the anti-government conspiracy of 伊×汉 and the rebellion of the Qashqai chieftain, with the aim of establishing a feudal isolated unit of ten provinces in southern Iran, forming a central government, destroying all democratic groups in Iran, and abandoning the pro-Soviet friendship policy. However, the Qashqai chieftain, due to insufficient strength, only insisted on replacing the representatives of the democratic parties in the cabinet with representatives of the southern feudal lords." Vladmirov concluded: "Although they did not achieve all their goals, they ultimately succeeded in forcing Sultani to abandon cooperation with democratic groups to some extent."

    苏尔坦尼政府改组是对反动势力让步
    【新华社延安二日电】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：佛拉第米罗夫在真理报撰文论伊朗形势称：苏尔坦尼政府之改组，未容纳群众党（或伊朗党）之代表，是对反动势力的明确让步。佛氏指出“苏尔坦尼自今年二月执政以来，曾实行了重要的改革，但这些改革尤其是他与国内广大民主人士合作及与苏联建立正常友谊关系的方针。遇到了某些伊朗人士及英国人士的反对。八月三日，在有民主政党代表参加的伊朗内阁成立后之翌日，英军即自印度调至伊拉克，并集中于伊朗边界巴斯拉。接着在英国代理人领导下发生了伊×汉的反政府阴谋及加什盖酋长之反叛，目的在于建立伊朗南部十省的封建孤立单位，成立中央政府，摧毁伊朗一切民主团体，放弃对苏友谊政策。但加什盖酋长因力量不够，只坚持撤换内阁中的民主政党代表，代以南方封建代表。”佛氏结语称：“他们虽未达到其全部目的，但终有达成迫使苏尔坦尼在某种程度上放弃与民主团体合作。”
