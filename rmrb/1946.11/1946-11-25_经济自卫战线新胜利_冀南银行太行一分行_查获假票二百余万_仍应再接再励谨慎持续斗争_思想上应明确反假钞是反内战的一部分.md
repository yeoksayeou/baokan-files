　　New Victory on the Economic Self-Defense Front
    Jinnan Bank Taihang First Branch
    Uncovers Over Two Million in Counterfeit Currency
    Continued Efforts and Vigilant Struggle are Still Needed
    Ideologically, It Should Be Clear that Fighting Counterfeit Currency is Part of the Anti-Civil War
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Since the Jinnan Bank's Taihang First Branch instructed all its sub-branches to mobilize the masses to combat counterfeit currency, in just one and a half months, the sub-branches have uncovered a total of 2.8 million yuan in counterfeit bills (mostly blue 500-yuan notes and blue Hebei-Shandong-Henan Plain Edition 100-yuan notes). At the branch meeting, county managers summarized the experiences in combating counterfeit currency: (1) County banks, based on the actual situation of each locality, should coordinate and unify arrangements with the government administrative offices in a planned manner. For example, the Yuanshi County Public Security Bureau used counterfeit bills as educational materials for anti-counterfeiting education. Gaoyi Elementary School incorporated anti-counterfeiting work into its teaching materials, allowing children to promote it widely in the markets, which had a great effect. (2) Establish counterfeit bill identification centers in various places (appointed by the bank), allowing nearby villagers to identify genuine and counterfeit bills anytime, anywhere. (3) Strengthen sentry posts and check pedestrians. For example, the Gaoyi sub-branch recently discovered counterfeit bills hidden in the double bottom of kerosene buckets, inside bicycle handlebars, and secretly carried in women's crotches, all of which were detected. (4) The counterfeit bill identification methods printed by the bank in the past were posted everywhere, but the masses found them too troublesome to read and understand, so they had little effect. On the contrary, in some places, they were stolen by special agents, which further promoted the timely improvement of counterfeit bills. Judging from the current situation, in order to disrupt our area's finances and cooperate with its all-out civil war, the Kuomintang is still printing large quantities of counterfeit Jinnan currency, using various methods to push it into our area. In order to completely smash this conspiracy of the Kuomintang and further raise the mass anti-counterfeiting campaign, Branch Manager Li pointed out in his speech: We must recognize that the struggle against counterfeit currency is a long-term and arduous task, and we must never be complacent with the existing achievements. The technology of counterfeit bills is improving day by day, and our work should strengthen research and improve the identification ability of each comrade. At the same time, anti-counterfeiting work is not just the responsibility of the bank, but the responsibility of every revolutionary worker. Therefore, we should humbly cooperate with governments at all levels to carry out the anti-counterfeiting campaign, using rural winter schools, small newspapers, blackboard newspapers, and other methods to carry out extensive publicity and education to the masses, crack down on unscrupulous merchants, implement both suppression and leniency, and reward model personnel who have uncovered counterfeit bills. Various places should establish more counterfeit bill identification centers (preferably allowing rural cooperatives to act as agents) to improve the identification ability of the masses. We should pay attention to the reconnaissance work of gatherings, strengthen the armed auxiliary capture work in mixed markets (where enemy and our currency are mixed), and carry out blockades and thorough checks of pedestrians in border areas. Our bank personnel should boldly publicize the harm of counterfeit bills to the masses, and should ideologically combine anti-counterfeiting with anti-civil war. Hu Haiyan, a counterfeit bill criminal caught by the Gaoyi sub-branch, was an intelligence officer of the Kuomintang in Shijiazhuang, who infiltrated our inland under the guise of a businessman, spreading counterfeit bills to disrupt our finances and secretly doing special agent work to cooperate with their military offensive. This is a very good proof.

　　经济自卫战线新胜利
    冀南银行太行一分行
    查获假票二百余万
    仍应再接再励谨慎持续斗争
    思想上应明确反假钞是反内战的一部分
    【本报讯】冀南银行太行区第一分行，自指示各支行发动群众性反假票以来，仅一个半月工夫，各支行共查获假票二百八十万元（蓝色五百元券与蓝色平原版百元券最多）。这次各县经理在分行会议上曾总结出反假票的经验：（一）县银行根据各地的实际情况与政府行署工作有计划配合与统一布置，如元氏县公安局拿假票作反假票教育材料。高邑小学把反假票工作编成教材让儿童到集市上普遍的宣传，效果很大。（二）各地设立假票辨别所（由银行委任），让邻近的老乡随时随地去辨认真假。（三）加强岗哨，盘查行人，如高邑支行近日发现煤油桶二层底内，与自行车把内，以及由女人的裤当里秘携假票等，都被检查出来。（四）银行过去印的假票辨认办法到处张贴，群众感到太麻烦看不懂，起作用不大，相反的在某些地方被特务盗走，更促使了假票的及时改进。根据目前情况看来，国民党为了捣乱我区金融，配合其全面内战，仍大量的印发假冀钞，利用各色各样的办法往我区推行。为彻底粉碎国民党这一阴谋，把群众性的反假票运动再提高一步，分行李经理在发言中指出：必须认识，反假票斗争是长期艰苦的工作，绝不要以现有的成绩而自傲，现假票的技术在日益改进，我们的工作就应加强研究，提高每同志的辨认力，同时反假票工作，不单纯是银行的责任，而是每个革命工作者的责任，因此我们应虚心的去配合各级政府，开展反假票运动，利用农村冬学、小报、黑板报等方式。向群众大量宣传教育，打击奸商，贯彻镇压与宽大的两方面，实行奖励查获假票模范人员，各地应更普遍的设立假票辨别所（最好让农村合作社代理），提高群众的辨认能力。我们要注意集会的侦察工作，加强混合市场（敌我区货币混合地）的武装辅助扑捉工作，开展边沿区的堵击与细密盘查行人。我们银行人员要大胆的向群众宣传假票对自己的害处，并应在思想上把反假票与反内战结合起来。高邑支行查获假票犯胡海彦，他是石家庄国民党的一个情报员，以商人名义侵入我内地，一面散发假票捣乱我金融，一面暗地作特务工作配合其军事进攻，这就是一个很好证明。
