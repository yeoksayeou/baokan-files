Resolving the Contradiction Between Participating in War and Production
    Accurate Calculation, Detailed Organization, Participating in Production, Unified Work Allocation
    Experience Summary of the Taihang Third Military Subdistrict Military Committee

    [This newspaper's dispatch] The Taihang Third Military Subdistrict Military Committee has recently summarized the following experiences regarding the integration of mass participation in war and production in the counties under its jurisdiction: First, the ideological problem of cadres. Some county, district, and village cadres do not have a clear understanding of the integration of participation in war and production. This is manifested in the idea that "militia participation in war is an obligation and should be given less work credit"; providing assistance to militia members is graded according to class background; and Military Committee cadres do not understand or are unwilling to understand how to do mass mobilization work, especially in the new areas, where there is complacency regarding this issue. The Subdistrict Military Committee believes that participation in the war is an obligation that everyone should have. The entire village's masses have the responsibility to share and complete the production work missed by anyone participating in war service. Only in this way will production not be affected, and will participation in war and production be truly integrated. Secondly, everyone should be treated equally when the masses in the village provide assistance to those whose production has been affected by war service. The previous method of "poor peasants receive full assistance without meals; middle peasants receive assistance with meals; rich peasants receive assistance with wages and meals" which was self-determined by some districts and villages should be considered incorrect. Because participation in the war is everyone's duty, this will affect the enthusiasm of the wealthy (such as well-to-do middle peasants) to participate in the war. And Military Committee cadres should understand that mobilizing the masses is the key to solving all problems. In the past, Military Committee cadres in the new areas neglected to lead the masses in implementing "land to the tillers," which was a mistake. War participation work in the new areas should be based on specific circumstances to study and come up with more reasonable methods. Second, several specific methods: (1) Unified leadership, division of responsibility. The entire village's labor force should be used in a unified and planned manner to reasonably solve the production difficulties of the participating militia, self-defense forces, and military dependents. Shexian County organized a "War Participation Production Work Adjustment Committee." This has played a significant role in ensuring that the land is not left uncultivated and that the militia, self-defense forces, and cadres are more united. The Wu'an County Command also specifically established a secretary to manage the daily affairs of issuing work tickets, bookkeeping, and allocating work. (2) Overall consideration, overall planning, large-scale labor exchange between the front and rear. For example, stipulating that self-defense forces on guard duty, militia looking after cases, and the old and weak delivering messages should not be given work credit; militia and self-defense forces participating in war service should be given one work credit per day; village cadres attending meetings in the county should be given one work credit for two days if they eat public meals, and one work credit for one day if they eat their own meals; work should be calculated by the "li" and by the hour, with five to ten "li" equivalent to half a day's work, and fifty to sixty "li" equivalent to one day's work; labor and animal power should be exchanged; work tickets and wages should be converted at market prices; work should be allocated to participating militia and military dependents first; urgent work should be done first, in preparation for participating in war at any time, etc. All of these can be used as reference and learning material for various places.

　　解决参战生产矛盾
    精确计算细密组织参加生产统一拨工
    太行三分区武委会经验总结
    【本报讯】太行三分区武委会，顷就该分区各县群众参战与生产结合情形总结出如下经验：第一、干部思想问题。若干县区、村干部对参战与生产结合的思想不够明确。表现在“民兵参战是义务，应当少顶工”；替民兵助耕按成份分等级；武委会干部不懂也不愿懂做发动群众工作，特别是新区对这问题有自满现象等。分区武委会认为：参战是人人应有的义务。任何人参加战勤工作而误下的生产工作，全村群众都有替他们分担完成的责任。只有这样，才不会误生产，才是参战与生产结合。其次，任何人因战勤误下的生产，村内群众助耕时应一律看待。过去某些区村自行规定的“贫农全助耕，不管饭；中农助耕管饭；富农助耕给工资管饭”办法应认为不对。因为参战是人人应尽的义务，那样会影响富有者（如富裕中农）参战积极性的。而武委会干部应懂得发动群众是解决一切问题的锁钥。过去新区武委会干部忽视领导群众实行“耕者有其田”，这是错误的。新区参战工作更应根据具体情况研究出比较合理的办法来。第二、几个具体办法：（一）统一领导，分工负责。把全村劳力统一的有计划的使用，合理解决参战民兵、自卫队与军属生产上的困难。涉县组织了“参战生产调工委员会”。使地不荒，民兵、自卫队、干部间更加团结，都起了很大作用。武安县指挥部并专设书记一人，管理发工票、记帐、拨工等日常事务。（二）全面照顾，全面计划，前后方大变工。如规定自卫队站岗，民兵看案，老、弱送信等不顶工；民兵、自卫队参战一天顶一工；村干到县里开会吃公家的两天顶一工，吃自己的一天顶一工；平时按里按时计工，五至十里顶一晌，五十至六十里顶一工；劳畜力变工；工票、工资按市价折合；先给参战民兵、军属拨工；先做紧活，以备随时参战等等。均可供各地参考、学习。
