    New Warlords Have Emerged in the United States, Plotting Expansion Plans
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 30th] According to the Associated Press, London, 28th, Moscow Radio claimed: New warlords are emerging in the United States and are beginning to control the American economy and politics. Radio commentator Dr. Lane said: The warlords are filled with militaristic and imperialistic spirit and have become the bastion of American reactionaries. At the same time, they are preparing to implement extensive expansion plans. It also said: American reactionaries are creating a theory that a minority can rule the country and the world. It continued: In view of all this, it is easy to understand why the Soviet Union proposed in the United Nations General Assembly to investigate the issue of foreign troops stationed in non-enemy countries.

    美国产生新军阀  图实行扩张计划
    【新华社延安三十日电】据美联社伦敦二十八日引莫斯科广播称：新的军阀正在美国产生，并开始控制美国经济和政治。广播评论员蓝恩博士说：军阀充满着军国主义和帝国主义的精神，已成为美国反动派的堡垒。同时准备实行广大的扩张计划。又说：美国反动派创造一种理论，以为少数人可以统治国家，并可以统治世界。继称：鉴于这一切，就很容易理解为什么苏联在联合国大会中提出调查外国军队驻在非敌国的问题了。
