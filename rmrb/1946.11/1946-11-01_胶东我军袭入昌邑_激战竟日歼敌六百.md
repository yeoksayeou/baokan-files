　　Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 29th—A unit of the Jiaodong Eighth Route Army, on the evening of the 19th, launched a fierce attack on the Chiang army's Eighth Army Independent Second Regiment entrenched in Changyi City, and immediately stormed into the city. At 3:00 AM the next morning, 4,000 Chiang troops came to reinforce from Hanting and Liyang, Weixian County, in two routes. After a day of fierce fighting, over 400 Chiang soldiers were killed, 150 captured alive, and five machine guns and over 100 rifles were seized. The Eighth Route Army, having achieved its goal of annihilating the enemy's active forces, took the initiative to transfer to the outskirts of the city that evening. On the same day, over 800 soldiers of the Chiang army's Twelfth Division Second Regiment, which occupied Dongsi Sheshan in Jimo, attempted to loot grain in all directions. They were repelled by local armed forces as soon as they left their stronghold, with 35 killed, wounded, or captured, and 31 long and short guns (including one American-made carbine) and over 1,000 rounds of ammunition seized.
