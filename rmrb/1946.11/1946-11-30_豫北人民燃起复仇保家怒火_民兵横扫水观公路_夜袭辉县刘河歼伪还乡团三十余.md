　　People of Northern Henan Ignite Flames of Revenge and Defend Their Homes
    Militia Sweep Through Shui-Guan Highway
    Night Raid on Liu River, Huixian Annihilates Over Thirty Puppet Homecoming Corps Members
    [This Dispatch from Changzhi, 28th] Since the 40th Division of the Chiang Army in Anyang, Northern Henan, invaded and occupied Shuiye and Guantai, they have repeatedly attempted to attack westward in the past half-month, and have continuously harassed and looted, but have been repelled by our local troops and civilians. According to the announcement by the Third Sub-district Military Commission: In the first half of November alone, the Anyang militia fought independently 47 times, killing 26 enemies, wounding 43, killing 10 with landmines, capturing alive 8 Chiang and puppet soldiers and special agents, and seizing 2 pistols and many other items. In recent days, the local armed forces and militia of the county have formed a strong revenge and home-defense guerrilla group, led personally by County Magistrate Ma, Political Commissar He, and Director Xu, cooperating with the sub-district troops to advance in ten routes into the rear of the Chiang army, taking the initiative to attack the Chiang puppets. On the night of the 19th, a militia battalion under Director Xu launched a surprise night attack on Shiguankou, north of Shuiye, destroying a huge enemy bunker. On the night of the 21st, County Magistrate Ma personally led an Anyang revenge detachment, cooperating with two battalions of Linxian support militia, sweeping through the Chiang army strongholds in Shijian, Shanjia area on the Shui (ye)-Guan (tai) highway, destroying eight enemy pillboxes. Currently, the flames of guerrilla warfare have spread to the Shangxia Guoyuan area. The Chiang puppets, intimidated by the powerful reputation of our guerrilla group, have been forced to defend isolated strongholds,不敢轻易小股出犯,不敢轻易小股出犯dare not easily launch small-scale attacks. Our troops and civilians freely travel on the Shui-Guan highway. The democratic government's orders are unimpeded in the vast villages around the strongholds. The masses assist our troops in guiding the way, delivering letters, and transporting the wounded, with the same enthusiasm as in the past. Young and middle-aged people who cannot bear the exploitation and looting by the Chiang puppets are joining the local guerrilla forces to ultimately defeat the Chiang army.
    [This Dispatch from Changzhi, 28th] A unit of our Third Sub-district local armed forces launched a surprise night attack on the Chiang puppet strongholds in Liu River and Wang River, southeast of Bobi, Huixian, on the night of the 23rd. More than 30 members of the puppet homecoming corps stationed there were completely annihilated, with 22 puppet corps members killed (including two captains), 8 captured alive, and one American-made machine gun, 20 American-made rifles, and more than 3,000 rounds of ammunition seized. We suffered only three wounded.
    [This Dispatch from Changzhi, 28th] On the 12th of this month, the Yan puppet "Revenge Team" stationed at Langyu Station in Pingding, colluding with more than 200 armed personnel from the puppet district office, looted Luomo Temple in our Fourth District. Near the village, they were ambushed by the Shouyang local armed forces and militia. The enemy left behind 20 corpses and fled back. Twenty-three rifles and one light machine gun were seized. The special agent head of the "Revenge Team," Ren Yongji, was also captured alive. We suffered no casualties. The local masses enthusiastically comforted our troops with soup and rice.

    【本报长治二十八日电】豫北安阳蒋军四十师自进陷我水冶、观台后，半月来虽一再企图西犯，并曾不断出扰抢掠，但均遭当地我军民击退。据三分区武委会公布：仅安阳民兵十一月上半月单独作战四十七次，毙敌二十六名，伤四十三名，地雷战炸死十名，活捉蒋伪军及特务八名，缴手枪二支，其他物品甚多。连日来，该县地方武装及民兵更组成强大的复仇保家游击集团，由马县长、何政委、徐主任亲自率领，配合分区部队分十路挺进蒋军后方，主动出击蒋伪。十九日夜，徐主任率领下之某民兵大队一个，首次夜袭水冶北之石棺，焚毁敌巨大碉堡一座。廿一日夜，马县长亲率安阳复仇一支队，配合林县支援民兵两个大队，横扫水（冶）观（台）公路上之石涧、山家一带之蒋军据点，毁敌八座大炮楼。现游击烽火已燃烧至上下果园一带，蒋伪慑于我游击集团之强大声威，已被迫困守孤立据点，不敢轻易小股出犯，水、观公路上我军民自由往来，据点周围广大村庄民主政府政令通行无阻，群众协助我军带路送信转运伤兵，热情殷殷，一如往昔。不堪蒋伪压榨与抢掠之青壮年，纷纷参加开入当地之游击部队，以最后击退蒋军。
