　　[Our Newspaper, Weixian, 31st dispatch] After the land reform, anti-traitor and liquidation struggles, the peasants of the Fourth District of Feixiang and the Sixth District of Enxian, who have gained liberation, have now automatically carried out land readjustment between villages on the basis of the initial realization of leveling and balancing within villages, in order to implement the principle of "land to the tiller." Xiaokangbao Village in the Fourth District of Feixiang has more land than the peasants can cultivate; Beixiebao has insufficient land for distribution. The peasants of Xiaokangbao voluntarily proposed, "Let's give some land to the brothers in Beixiebao so that everyone has land to cultivate and a solid foundation for prosperity." However, it was difficult to proceed because there was a Dakangbao Village between the two villages. Recently, they came up with a "land swap" method, discussed it with the peasants of Dakangbao, and swapped the southern land of Xiaokangbao Village with Dakangbao, and the southern land of Dakangbao Village with Beixiebao. After obtaining the land, the masses of Beixiebao said, "Now it is truly one family for the peasants of the world! We must take good care of the seeds and produce more grain to repay the kindness of the brothers in Xiaokangbao." The peasants of Dazhuang Village in the Sixth District of Enxian also used similar methods to help the peasants of the poor small villages of Sanshengtang and Yihezhuang. After the three villages launched a joint struggle at the end of September and overthrew the traitorous landlords, the peasants of Dazhuang Village voluntarily gave land to the peasants of the two small villages to divide when distributing the fruits of the struggle, only taking some money and materials for themselves. In addition, some peasants voluntarily sold their surplus land obtained from the liquidation at a low price to the poor peasants of the two small villages, at a price of one mu per hundred catties of grain (some peasants could not even afford this small amount of grain, so the farmers' association would pay for it in advance, so that they could immediately obtain the land they needed for cultivation). They said, "We were all poor people before and know the hardship of not having land to cultivate. Everyone struggled together! We can't say that we have land and don't care about others!" The method of voluntary land readjustment in these villages is being promoted by the leadership to villages that have been initially leveled, but it is limited to villages with very large discrepancies between them; those with only slight differences remain as they are.

　　肥恩若干村初步完成填平补齐
    富村自动赠地给贫村
    【本报威县三十一日电】肥乡四区与恩县六区经过反奸清算斗争，获得翻身的农民，现已在一村内初步实现了填平补齐的基础上自动进行村与村的土地调剂，以贯彻实现耕者有其田。肥乡四区小康堡村土地多，超过农民能耕之数；北谢堡土地则不敷分配，小康堡农民就自动提出“让一部分土地给北谢堡的弟兄们，叫大家都有地种，都扎下富根”；可是因二村之间隔着一个大康堡村，不好进行。最近他们想出一个“兑地”的办法，和大康堡农民商量好，把小康堡村南地兑给大康堡，而将大康堡村南地兑给北谢堡。北谢堡群众在获得土地之后，都说：“如今可真是天下农民是一家啦！咱们要好好养种，多打粮食，回答小康堡兄弟们的好意。”恩县六区大储庄农民，也以类似办法帮助贫苦小村三盛堂与义和庄的农民。该三村在九月底举行联合斗争，把奸霸地主斗倒之后，分配果实时，大储庄农民即自动将土地让给二小庄农民去分，自己只分些钱与物资。另外有些农民将个人清算所得之多余土地，自动贱价卖与二小庄贫苦农民。每百斤粮食一亩（有些农民连这少数粮食也拿不出来的，即先由农会垫出，使他们马上获得所需之地，进行耕种）。他们说：“咱以前都是穷人，知道没地种的苦处。大家都在一块斗争过来！不能说咱有了地就不管人家！”这几个村的自动调剂土地办法，正由领导上向初步填平了的村庄推行，但只限于悬殊太大的村与村之间，仅有微小差异的，则保持原状。
