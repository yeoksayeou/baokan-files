　　Make Persistent Efforts to Strive for Victory in the Overall Resistance
    Liberation Daily Editorial, November 2nd
    Just as Chiang Kai-shek is arrogantly and unreasonably coercing the CCP and the third parties to participate in his illegally convened "National Assembly" which violates the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference by demanding "continued civil war if the list is not handed over"; Just as Chiang Kai-shek, under the guise of a peace offensive, is intensifying his attacks on the liberated areas, leading to the failure of the third parties' peace efforts and completely exposing Chiang Kai-shek's lack of sincerity for peace, arousing great indignation among the people of the whole country; the good news has arrived that in October, the soldiers of the Jinchaji Liberated Area annihilated 4,000 enemies near Baoding on the Pinghan Railway. At the same time, our troops in northern Jiangsu and the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area annihilated Chiang's troops invading Lianshui in northern Jiangsu and Juancheng and Puyang in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area, causing Chiang's army to lose as many as three full brigades.
    The victories of these two battles both occurred in the central area of Chiang Kai-shek's current military offensive, under the command of Xue Yue. They powerfully struck at Chiang's army's attempts to quickly occupy Lianshui, Shuyang, Puyang, and Daming, open up the eastern section of the Longhai Railway and the central section of the Pinghan Railway, and cut off the connection between our troops in Jiangsu-Anhui and Shandong, and the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area and the Taihang Mountains, causing Xue Yue's offensive deployment to suffer serious setbacks. This shows that the likes of Chiang Kai-shek and Chen Cheng's dream of eliminating the CCP's forces in three to five months is purely a pipe dream; the reactionary American faction's attempt to use and support Chiang Kai-shek to suppress the Chinese democratic movement with force is fundamentally impossible. It also shows that the military and civilians in the liberated areas are capable of crushing Chiang Kai-shek's offensive and achieving victory in the just war of self-defense.
    The victories in northern Jiangsu and the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area once again demonstrate that no matter how cunning or cautious Chiang Kai-shek is, and no matter what kind of military tactics are adopted to attack us by steadily advancing on all fronts, as long as we have a clear understanding of the enemy's situation, thorough deployment, and are good at seeking out the weaknesses of Chiang's army, and maneuver skillfully, we will eventually have the opportunity to annihilate the enemy's forces. The Zhang Lingfu unit, which was annihilated in northern Jiangsu, had already suffered considerable losses in Huai'an and Huaiyin and should have been transferred to the rear for rest and reorganization. However, Chiang Kai-shek suddenly issued a "circular of commendation." This commendation order, as the captured officers and soldiers of the 74th Division said, became a "death warrant" that made Zhang Lingfu lose his mind and led his troops to take a risky offensive against Lianshui, saying, "We will rest after taking Lianshui." The military and civilians in northern Jiangsu were filled with righteous indignation, vowing to fight to the death against the invaders. It is precisely because our side is engaged in just self-defense, and Chiang's side is waging an unjust, anti-people war, and precisely because a grieving army is bound to win and a proud army is bound to be defeated, the suburbs of Lianshui have become the graveyard of Chiang's army. As for the weakness of Chiang's army's insufficient troop strength, it cannot be overcome at all, whether in northern Jiangsu or the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area. It is very obvious that after Chiang's army in northern Jiangsu occupied Huai'an and Huaiyin and continued its southward invasion of the more than 200-mile canal line from Baoying to Gaoyou, its troop strength was greatly dispersed. This weakness was fully exposed in this offensive against Lianshui, and it was annihilated. After Chiang's army in Hebei-Shandong-Henan occupied Heze and Jinxiang, it also had to allocate a large number of troops to defend the transportation lines and occupied areas, greatly weakening the combat effectiveness of its field army. Its annihilation this time was also expected. Therefore, the more cities Chiang's army occupies, the longer the front line, and the more dispersed the troop strength, the more opportunities there are for suffering annihilation. Often, when Chiang's army is elated because of occupying a certain city, it is precisely the day it is about to suffer annihilation. The abandonment of Taixing and Rugao led to the seven consecutive victories in the southern line of northern Jiangsu; the withdrawal from Dongming and Dingtao was followed by the great victory in which the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area annihilated Zhao Xitian's units. With the development of historical facts, the brilliance of this indestructible truth is increasingly tempered. We must seriously educate all the military and civilians in the liberated areas to deeply understand: "The outcome of the war does not lie in the gains and losses of a city or a place, but in the waxing and waning of living forces." This truth calls on all combatant military and civilians, whether it is the main force corps or local armed forces, to learn and master the principle of "concentrating absolute superior forces to annihilate the enemy's living forces." All kinds of work, whether party, government, military, or civilian, must strive for the goal of "annihilating the enemy's living forces."
    The victories in northern Jiangsu and the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area were mainly the success of the field army's mobile warfare, but the guerrilla warfare in Chiang's occupied areas also played a great supporting role. The widespread activity of the militia guerrilla teams in Chiang's occupied area in the southern line of central Jiangsu, and the opening up of guerrilla bases south of Dingtao and Heze in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area and south of the Daocheng Road in northern Henan, gave great threats to Chiang's army's rear, contained Chiang's army's strength, and at the same time allowed our frontal main force to free up its hands to maneuver and annihilate the enemy. Now, wherever Chiang Kai-shek occupies, American soldiers and American goods follow in droves. Chiang Kai-shek's troops and his secret agents plunder land, seize property, conscript soldiers, collect grain, and extort money, committing all kinds of evil deeds, and all classes suffer from it; even the landlords in central Jiangsu are reduced to tears, and compared with the rule of the past democratic government, it is like heaven and hell. This is bound to arouse the public outrage of all compatriots and rise up to defend their homes and defend themselves. That is to say, there are full objective conditions and foundations for carrying out guerrilla warfare in Chiang's occupied areas. Therefore, in the future, wherever it is temporarily occupied by Chiang's army, we must learn from the examples of eastern Hebei, central Jiangsu, and the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area, make preparations and deployments in advance, continue to mobilize the masses, strengthen the militia guerrilla teams, launch widespread guerrilla warfare, persist in various struggles, protect the vital interests of the local people, and cooperate with the frontal main force in combat, and when the time is ripe in the future, launch a counter-offensive against Chiang's army.
    These two victories in northern Jiangsu and the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area eliminated three brigades of Chiang's army. Together with the operations in the previous three months, the losses of Chiang's army's regular troops are about thirty-three brigades. These troops were established by Chiang Kai-shek over one or two decades of effort, and after they are eliminated, they cannot be rebuilt in a short period of time, which is indeed a painful loss for Chiang Kai-shek. But Chiang Kai-shek has not given up, and with the active help of American imperialism, he has not changed his dream of eliminating the CCP and the liberated areas by force. He still wants to wage the civil war for a long time, making it bigger and fiercer, and he is launching offensives in eight areas at the same time. Recently, he is attacking Linyi, the capital of the Shandong liberated area, and even attempting to attack the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. Therefore, in the next few months, the war will be unprecedentedly fierce, cruel, and arduous. All the military and civilians in our liberated areas should be fully prepared ideologically and in practical work, so that each of us will further strengthen our confidence in victory and our determination to overcome any difficulties. At the same time, we must not be proud of the victories we have already achieved. As Chairman Mao said: guard against arrogance and rashness, make persistent efforts, unite as one, and fight to the end. Now Chiang Kai-shek's reserves have been exhausted, and there are few troops that can be transferred from the rear. His current crazy offensive is very risky, just as Professor Chen Jinkun said, it is a kind of "last ray of sunset." As long as we continue to work hard, continue to annihilate a large number of Chiang's army's living forces as we have done in the past four months, in the near future, we can switch to a counter-offensive and strive for the final victory of the overall resistance.

### 再接再厉争取全面抵抗的胜利

　　再接再厉争取全面抵抗的胜利
    解放日报二日社论
    正当蒋介石骄横无理地以“不交出名单即继续内战”，胁迫中共及第三方面参加其违反政协决议一手包办的非法“国大”的时候；正当蒋介石在和平攻势掩盖下得寸进尺对解放区扩大进攻，使第三方面的和平努力归于失败，蒋介石对和平毫无诚意已完全暴露，引起全国人民莫大愤慨的时候；捷报传来，十月晋察冀子弟兵在平汉路保定附近歼敌四千，同时苏北与冀鲁豫我军分别歼灭进犯苏北涟水与冀鲁豫鄄城濮阳的蒋军，蒋军损失达三个整旅之众。
    这两个战役的胜利，都发生在蒋介石当前军事进攻的中心薛岳指挥战场，它有力地打击了蒋军迅速占领涟水沭阳和濮阳大名、打通陇海路东段和平汉路中段、切断我军苏皖和山东及冀鲁豫与太行联系的企图，使薛岳的进攻部署遭受严重的挫折。这说明蒋介石陈诚之辈想在三五个月内消灭中共力量，纯系痴人梦呓；美国反动派想利用和支持蒋介石以武力压迫中国民主运动屈服，是根本办不到的。同时也说明解放区军民能够粉碎蒋介石的进攻，取得正义的自卫战争的胜利。
    苏北和冀鲁豫的胜利，再一次说明无论蒋介石如何狡猾如何谨慎小心，采取齐头并进稳扎稳打的军法向我进攻，只要我们对敌情侦察清楚部署周密，善于寻求蒋军的弱点，机动作战，终有机会歼灭敌人的有生力量。苏北被歼的张灵甫部在两淮已受相当损失，本来应该调到后方休整，但蒋介石突然来了个“传令嘉奖”，这道嘉奖令，正如被俘的七十四师官兵所说，恰恰成了“催命符”把张灵甫冲昏头脑，率领所部向涟水冒险进攻，说“打下涟水再休息”。而苏北军民则义愤填胸，誓与进犯者决死战。正是由于我方是正义自卫，蒋方是非正义的反人民的战争，正由于哀兵必胜骄兵必败，涟水城郊就成为蒋军的坟墓。至于说到蒋军兵力不足的弱点根本无法克服一点，无论苏北或冀鲁豫部十分显然。苏北蒋军占领两淮续又南侵宝应至高邮二百多里的运河线，兵力便大为分散，这次进攻涟水，这一弱点完全暴露，乃遭歼灭打击。冀鲁豫蒋军占领荷泽金乡以后，同样亦不能不分出很大兵力去守备交通线与侵占区，其野战军的战斗力便大大削弱，此次被歼也是意料中事。所以蒋军侵占的城市愈多，战线愈长，兵力愈分散，遭受歼灭打击的机会愈多。往往蒋军因侵占某一城池而趾高气扬之时，正是其行将遭受歼灭打击之日。泰兴、如皋的放弃，乃有苏北南线的七战七捷；东明定陶之退出，接着出现冀鲁豫歼灭赵锡田等部的大捷。此次两淮与焦作的相继撤离，又换得了这么两个大胜。以历史事实的发展，愈益磨炼出这一颠扑不破真理的光辉。我们必须认真教育解放区全体军民深刻认识：“战争的胜负，不在一城一地的得失，而在有生力量之消长”。这一真理，号召全体作战军民，无论主力兵团、地方武装，都要学会和掌握“集中绝对优势兵力，消灭敌人有生力量”的方针，无论党政军民各种工作都要为着这一“歼灭敌人有生力量”的目标而努力奋斗。
    在苏北与冀鲁豫的胜利，主要是野战军运动战的成功，但是蒋军侵占区中的游击战，也起了很大配合作用。苏中南线蒋军侵占区民兵游击队的广泛活跃，冀鲁豫定陶荷泽以南与豫北道清路南游击根据地的开辟，给予蒋军后方很大威胁，牵制了蒋军兵力，同时使我正面主力得以空出手来运动歼敌。现在凡蒋介石侵占地区，美国兵和美国货即随之滚滚而来。蒋介石军队及其特务抢掠土地、霸占房产、抓丁征粮、敲诈勒索无恶不作，各阶层同受其害；就是苏中地主也被弄得欲哭无泪，与过去民主政府治下相比，不啻天堂地狱。这必然激起全体同胞公愤，奋起保家自卫。这就是说，在蒋军侵占区有开展游击战争的充分客观条件和基础。所以今后凡暂被蒋军侵占的地方，都要学习冀东、苏中、冀鲁豫的榜样，预作准备和布置，继续发动群众，壮大民兵游击队，发动广泛游击战争，坚持各种斗争，保护当地人民切身利益，并配合正面主力作战，待将来时机成熟，向蒋军举行反攻。
    苏北与冀鲁豫的这两个胜利，打掉蒋军三个旅，连前三个多月的作战，蒋军正规部队的损失在三十三个旅左右。这些部队都是蒋介石一二十年功夫建立起来的，消灭之后，决非短期内所能重建，对于蒋介石的确是个惨痛的损失。但蒋介石还没有死心，他在美帝国主义的积极帮助之下，并未丝毫改变其武力消灭中共和解放区的梦想，他还想把内战长期打下去，打得更大更凶，他正在八个地区同时发动进攻。最近正进攻山东解放区首府临沂，甚至企图进攻陕甘宁边区。因此，在今后几个月内，战事将会空前的激烈残酷和艰苦。我们解放区全体军民，在思想上和实际工作上，都应有充分的准备，使我们每一个人更加加强必胜的信心和克服任何困难的决心，同时亦不要因为已得的胜利而骄傲，应该如毛主席所说的：戒骄戒躁，再接再厉，同心同德，奋斗到底。现在蒋介石的后备已经枯竭，后方可调兵力无几，他目前这种疯狂进攻是十分冒险的，正如陈瑾昆教授所说是一种：“回光返照”，只要我们继续努一把力，像过去四个月那样继续大量歼灭蒋军有生力量，在不远的将来，我们就可转入反攻，争取全面抵抗的最后胜利。
