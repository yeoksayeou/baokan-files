(Our newspaper, Yangcheng, 19th dispatch) The Jincheng Land Reform Heroes Conference, in summarizing the mass movement on the 13th, proposed the county's future working principle as "Focusing on backward villages to deepen the land reform movement and universally realize 'land to the tiller'." Of the 1,200 natural villages in Jincheng County, 640 have already realized "land to the tiller," while 556 have not yet fully realized it. Based on this situation, the decided steps are: First, continue to oppose traitors and settle accounts, reduce rent and interest. Second, unite all peasants, especially middle peasants, to struggle together. Third, the fruits of the struggle should be rationally distributed through mass democratic discussion, with special consideration given to the families of revolutionary martyrs and the extremely poor, thoroughly implementing a one-time leveling and replenishment movement. Secondly, in advanced villages, a thorough review of the land reform should be conducted to cut off the remaining feudal vestiges. Abolish old contracts and establish new contracts. Vigorously carry out land reform education. Call on land-reform peasants to buy a copy of the "Land Reform Four-Character Classic" (翻身四字经), discuss it in class, and inspire the masses to conduct land-reform inspections to see if the roots of poverty have been dug out completely. After the land reform movement is completed in each village, a land reform celebration meeting can be held to reorganize peasant organizations, consolidate and expand peasant associations, inspect the militia, and eliminate special agents. To counter special agents, trace the old roots and find the background, distinguish clearly, and strike hard. Then, transform the village government and establish a production plan for next year. This winter, special efforts should be made to strengthen women's work and establish women's associations. In areas where "land to the tiller" has been thoroughly realized, organize women to spin and weave on a large scale, so that every household spins cotton and every village weaves cloth. At the closing of the conference, all the heroes called on the peasants of the county to unite, arm themselves, defend the fruits of land reform, and defend the people's savior, Chairman Mao.

　　晋城决定今后工作重点
    开展落后村群运
    先进村进行翻身大检查
    【本报阳城十九日电】晋城翻身英雄大会于十三日总结群运时，提出全县今后的工作方针为“面向落后村深入翻身运动，普遍实现耕者有其田。”晋城全县一千二百个自然村，现已实现耕者有其田者六百四十个，尚未完全实现者五百五十六个。根据这个情况，决定进行步骤是：第一，继续反奸清算，退租退息。第二，团结全体农民，特别是团结中农，一齐斗争。第三，斗争果实经群众民主讨论，合理分配。特别照顾抗属赤贫，彻底实行一次填平补齐运动。其次，在先进村庄还要实行翻身大检查，割掉残留的封建尾巴。废旧契，立新契。抓紧进行翻身教育。号召翻身农民都买一本翻身四字经，上课讨论，启发群众进行翻身检查，看挖穷根是否挖到了底。翻身运动完毕各村，可开一个翻身庆祝大会，整理农民组织，巩固扩大农会，检查民兵，肃清特务。反特务要追老根、找后台，分的清，打的痛。然后改造村政权，订立明年生产计划。今冬要特别加强妇女工作，成立妇女会。在彻底实现耕者有其田的地区，大量组织妇女纺织，做到家家纺花，村村织布。大会闭幕时，全体英雄号召全县农民团结起来，武装起来，保卫翻身果实，保卫人民的救星毛主席。
