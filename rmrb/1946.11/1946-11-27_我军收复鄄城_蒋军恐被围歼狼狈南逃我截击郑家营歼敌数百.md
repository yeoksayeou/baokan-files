　　Our Army Recovers Juancheng
    Chiang's Army Fears Encirclement and Annihilation, Flees South in Panic, We Intercept at Zhengjiaying, Annihilating Several Hundred Enemy Troops
    [Urgent Dispatch from the JiluYu Front, November 24th, by Our Newspaper] Our JiluYu army recovered Juancheng on the 20th. Simultaneously with our main force encircling and annihilating Chiang's army invading the southeastern area of Hua County, local armed forces of ×× and others also actively attacked the Fifth Army that had invaded the Juancheng area. This unit, deeply fearing encirclement and annihilation by our forces, fled in panic towards Heze and Dongming. Our army inflicted several hundred casualties on the fleeing enemy near Zhengjiaying, and in the pursuit, intercepted five trucks, a large quantity of weapons and military supplies, and recovered a portion of the cattle plundered from the people.

    【本报冀鲁豫前线二十四日急电】冀鲁豫我军于二十日收复鄄城。与我大军围歼进犯滑县东南地区之蒋军同时，××等部地方武装亦积极向侵据我鄄城一带之第五军袭击，该部深恐被我包围歼灭，乃仓惶向荷泽、东明逃逸。我军在郑家营附近曾予逃逸之敌以数百人之杀伤，并于追击中截获汽车五辆，武器及军用物资甚多，并夺回老百姓被抢去之耕牛一部。
