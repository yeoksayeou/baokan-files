　　The Whirlwind of the People of Shahe
　　-- A Record of Enlistment
　　Gao Ergong

　　Chiang Kai-shek's army, equipped by the United States, is invading the JiluYu region.

　　I personally witnessed the people of Shahe "suddenly! -- suddenly" rise to their feet upon hearing the news.

　　In the Sixth District, at the Ge Village accusation meeting that lasted for two days, people recalled the days of oppression before the Eighth Route Army liberated this place. Men and women cried so much that they couldn't stand up straight. Even the twenty-four young militiamen cried so much that none of them could speak three consecutive sentences. Militia Captain Li Wuni, this sturdy young man like a calf, cried so much that he needed to be helped out of the room. When they had all wiped away their tears, someone soberly proposed to join the army. This immediately took the lead. At the meeting on October 3rd, twenty-three people signed up in a short while, including nine women.

　　Shen Duan's, a forty-seven-year-old woman who wanted to go to the front lines to sew and mend for the soldiers and to serve them with hot water, resolutely said to me, "Wherever the army goes, I will follow." Her eight-year-old daughter secretly shed tears when she heard her mother say she would leave her at home, but the mother only stroked the child's hair and smiled. I think her sense of social responsibility must have overwhelmed her maternal love, so we shouldn't accuse her of being cold-hearted. She went on to talk about how one of her sons was captured by the enemy to repair blockhouses, saying, "He worked for a month and three days, drinking horse urine, drinking water from the pits, and eating only one raw corn cob a day… it was good to even steal raw pumpkins from the field to eat." Her tears flowed out. Now, an army specializing in building bunkers was about to attack again. She stood up for herself because she loved more people's children. Don't be surprised by the women's awakening. Just look at the fact that Shen Tongxi's mother fainted from anger when she cursed the old rulers during the accusation meeting, and you can see that it is only natural for women to fight to defend the good times. Li Fubao signed up, and his wife Zhang Qin also signed up. Old Li's brother had volunteered to join the army before, but when he went to the county for a physical examination, they said he had scabies and wasn't allowed to enlist. This time, his wife Xue Qin signed up again. Li Fubao said, "The Eighth Route Army liberated our lives. … We have houses to live in and food to eat. Before, we didn't even have clothes!" He contentedly touched his new willow-cloth clothes from top to bottom.

　　Gao Ju, wearing a sports cap and with a square, dark face, was only twenty years old. He had become engaged to Yang Cheng from the same street after the turn-over, and the wedding date was approaching: October 29th. But the sound of the attacking cannons made him unable to endure it any longer. He had to join the army. He was a good militiaman who feared no difficulties. He raised his head and, with his unique duck-like voice, tirelessly shouted, "Let Old Chiang fight! Hey! With our Eighth Route Army, let him come and fight!" He was playing with a pair of pliers in his hand, the jaws coldly open, naturally waiting for something. Finally, he commented: "We are all thinking of the greater good, while they (referring to Chiang's army) are all thinking of themselves. … I heard I could join the army, and I was so happy I couldn't contain myself. Good, this time we have to fight them to the death." It was a life-and-death struggle, but in his eyes, it was like going to Chiang Kai-shek to deliver an invitation to a feast of eight cold dishes and eight hot dishes. I suddenly remembered seeing a young new recruit in Shahe city, still playing with a bird in his hand, as if going to the spring countryside for a picnic on his way to enlist.

　　Zhang Chen shouted as if arguing: "District Chief, if you call me back again this time and don't let me go, I'll risk my life and argue with you! You said I was sick, but this time I'm all better!" Two months earlier, he had volunteered to join the army, but he happened to be sick and didn't get examined. District Chief Li Weihe had to spend a lot of effort to persuade them to return, comforting them that serving the people was the same as participating in the militia in the village. Seeing his serious face, you could tell that he had suffered great torment. Let's take a drop from his history that made him "want to cry when he thought about it": "The year before last, I borrowed money from Zhang Laoqi, whose nickname was Yama, the little Chiang Kai-shek of our village. I borrowed five yuan, and with that money, I bought five jin of rice from him. Half a jin of sand was mixed in with the five jin. Huh? You don't want it? How dare you not want it? … That five yuan was used for a year, and the interest was thirty jin of wheat and twenty-five jin of millet. …" The Eighth Route Army came and they turned over. Today, the big and small rulers who used to make him suffer want to stop him from turning over again. Isn't the reason why he still wants to go even after being "rejected" once very clear?

　　More and more people signed up to join the army. By the afternoon of the 5th, there were already forty-nine people. Everyone knew that this was their own business. The new shoes and clothes that the women made for the new soldiers were rushed out overnight and sent over. The mutual-aid farming teams, voluntarily formed by those who did not join the army, had already planted wheat for the new recruits. In the evening, I saw another person come to sign up. It was Shen Shoucheng, the oil peddler. Because he carried his oil load and sold it in the surrounding villages for days, when he returned to his small village after being away for a few days, he discovered such a big change. He thought about the fact that he didn't have an acre of land before, but after the turn-over, he was farming five mu of paddy fields, and the past events of various rulers -- village chiefs, tax collectors, and local bullies -- taking oil without paying for it were all imprinted in his mind. Therefore, he put down his oil load and immediately ran to sign up.

　　When Ge Village had just reported fifty people, I left this small village with more than 1,500 people.

　　On the road from Ge Village to Zhongwang Village, I saw a young man joining the army. Although someone was helping him farm, he was still diligently working his own land. From his enthusiastic labor with each stroke of the hoe, you could clearly see how much he loved this land that he had just struggled to reclaim. In another two or three days, the hoe would be replaced by a gun, to fight to defend this land. Hoe! Hoe! …

　　When I arrived at Zhongwang Village, seventy-six people wanted to join the army, including eight women. A check of the number of households in the village revealed that there were only one hundred and seventy-eight families. To protect their homes, everyone was willing to temporarily leave their homes. But the cadres of Zhongwang Village were working hard to persuade some of the older and weaker people not to go, because everyone knew that the Eighth Route Army was stricter in selecting new soldiers than choosing a groom. People over the age of thirty had to beware of being told that they were too old. On this day, Zhongwang Village persuaded eighteen people not to go.

　　I happened to see a comrade from the Eighth Route Army asking the new soldier Zhao Wancai how old he was. He smiled nervously and asked, "Why are you asking?" Then he eloquently stated, "This time I go, I'll stick to Chairman Mao even if I have to glue myself to him. If you say I'm too old and won't let me be a soldier, I'll be a cook or a groom, chopping grass and feeding horses. This time, I have to go… to contribute to Chairman Mao." Li Menggen, who was thirty-seven years old and also had the ability to repair guns, was also worried that he would be rejected because of his age. He said unhappily, "I'll buy two jin of glue and take it with me! Once I'm stuck on, you won't be able to pull me off."

　　At night, the masses of Zhongwang Village applauded and welcomed the fifty-odd heroes who were victorious in the preliminary selection to the Farmers' Association to drink a farewell cup of wine.

　　The main room was full of new soldiers, and the lights shone on their red faces. This was also a room full of young and middle-aged people who had been oppressed in the past, had turned over completely, and were now going to the front lines. Like Zhao Congshan, in the thirty-second year (1943) his family of nine ate a total of twelve liang of rice a day, with his father eating four liang and the rest each eating one liang of rice a day. They survived on bran and wild vegetables. When things were slightly better, he opened a steamed bun shop, but the village chief and privileged people ate for free, and the business could only be done at a loss. But after liberation last year, the democratic government temporarily borrowed 130 jin of public grain from him, and this spring, they returned 122 jin. He exclaimed, "I only paid eight jin of public grain a year! This year I turned over and planted thirteen mu of good paddy fields!"

　　Zhao Fa, who had worked as a farmhand for fourteen years, also joined the army. Before, he only had two mu of barren sandy land that didn't produce grain. Now he farms seven mu of good land, shares a waterwheel with two other families, and even bought a donkey. He said, "I just turned over, and Chiang Kai-shek is invading again. He's not letting us turn over! This time, if Chairman Mao doesn't give me a gun, I'll fight him with an iron hoe!"

　　They raised their glasses and drank heartily.

　　They sang the emancipation song together in a tragic and stirring manner.

　　The moonlight shone on the great North China Plain. The plain was quiet. The sweet smell of wine condensed in the cold air. If you listened carefully, you could hear the angry singing of the masses in the nearby villages, and the masses of Nanwang Village, a mile away, were beating the drums louder and louder, calling for an emergency meeting!

　　The next morning, district worker Liu Wenbin galloped past on a fast, sorrel horse. I shouted and asked him:

　　"Are there people joining the army in Nanwang Village too?"

　　"More than fifty people signed up last night, and there will be even more today!" he shouted back in a hurry.

　　沙河人民的旋风
    ——记参军
    高而公
    美国装备了的蒋军向冀鲁豫进犯了。
    我亲眼见沙河人民闻讯“忽！--忽”的站了起来。
    在六区葛村控诉性的诉苦会开了两天，人们回念八路军没解放这里以前受压迫的日子，男男女女都哭的扶不起来，连二十四个民兵小伙子也都哭的谁也说不上三句话，民兵队长李五妮，这茁壮得像小牛犊的青年人，哭得走出房门都得人扶搀着。当他们眼泪都揩干时，有人清醒的提出要求参军。一下子引了头，在十月三号的会上一会儿就有二十三个人报名，里面还有九个妇女。
    要求上前线给战士缝缝补补，给彩号侍候汤水的四十七岁的沈段氏，她坚决的对我说：“军队开到哪，我就跟到哪。”她那八岁的小女孩听母亲说要把自己放在家里时，便偷偷的淌着眼泪，但做母亲的只抚摸着孩子的头发微笑着，我想她的社会责任感大约是压倒了母爱的感情，当不能以冷酷相责吧。她接着说起自己的一个儿子怎样被敌人抓去应差修炮楼，她说：“干了一个月零三天，喝马尿，喝坑里的水，一天吃一根生棒子穗，……在地里偷生北瓜吃都是好的了。”她的眼泪流出来了，这回，专门以修碉堡为能事的军队又要来进攻，她自己挺身而出了，因为她爱着更多人的孩子。不要奇怪妇女的这样觉悟，单看诉苦时沈同喜娘痛骂旧日的统治者时气晕倒的事实，便可以知道妇女们也为保卫好时光而战那应该是很自然的事。李福保报名了，他的女人张琴的也报名了，老李的哥哥前一次自动参军，到县里去检查身体时说他生疥没允许入伍，这回老婆薛琴的又报名参军了。李福保说：“八路军来把俺命都解放出来了。……有房子住，有粮食吃，从前呢，衣裳都没有！”他满足的摸着自己上下一身新的柳条布衣裳。
    戴运动小帽，方方黑脸的高举的，才二十岁，翻身以后才和本街的杨成的订了婚，而且结婚的日期也近了：十月二十九日。但是进攻的炮声使他不能忍耐了，非去参军不可。这是一个不怕任何困难的好民兵，他昂着头，用他那特有的公鸭嗓音，嗄嗄不倦的叫说着：“老蒋他就打吧！嘿！就咱这个八路军，叫他来打吧！”他手里玩弄着一个老虎钳子，钳口正冷冷的张开，自然是在等待着什么。最后他做了评论：“咱这些人都是顾大家，他们（指蒋军）都是顾个人。……听说能参军，真高兴的吃不住劲。好，这回咱非去和他们拚一下不可。”那是生与死的搏斗，而在他眼里却像赴蒋介石下请贴邀他大吃一顿八碟子八碗一样，我顿时记起在沙河城里曾看见一个新参军的年青战士，手里还玩耍着一只鸟，如同到春郊去游嬉一样的去入伍。
    张臣的如同吵架一般的嚷着：“区长这回再叫我回来，不让去，我豁出命来也和他搞搞理！你说我有病，这回咱病好了呀！”他在两个月以前自动请求参军，正赶上闹病，没检查上。区长李维合可费不少力才劝回了他们，安慰他们回村参加民兵也一样的是为人民服务。看见他那严肃的面容，可以知道他曾受过大折磨，从他“提起光想掉泪”的历史中取出一滴来看吧：“前年跟张老齐借钱，他小名叫阎王，咱村的小老蒋，借了五元钱，拿这钱又跟他量了五斤米，五斤里就掺了半斤沙子，吓？你不要，你敢不要？……这五元钱使了一年，出的利钱是三十斤麦子，廿五斤谷子。……”八路军来了他们翻的身，今天旧日使他吃尽苦头的大大小小统治者又想来阻挡他翻身，因而他虽然被“检查下来”一次还想再去，这道理还不很明白吗？
    报名参军的人愈来愈多，到五号下午已经有了四十九名，人人都知道这是自己的事，妇女们给新战士做的新鞋、衣裳，都连夜赶好送来了。没参军的人自愿组成的代耕队，已经为新参军的人把麦子都种下去了。傍晚，又看见一个人来报名，是卖油郎沈寿成，因为他担着油担子连日在四乡叫卖，当他回到这几日不见的小村里，发现了有这样大的变动，而想到从前自己没有一亩地，翻身后种着五亩水地的事实和过去形形色色的统治者--保长、税卡、恶霸打了油从不给钱的往事，他都烙印在心头，因此他放下了油担子，马上跑来报了名。
    当葛村刚报到五十名的时候，我离开了这一千五百多人口的小村子。
    在从葛村到中汪村的路上，我见到一个参军的青年，虽然有人代耕，但他还亲自勤恳不倦的耕作他的那块土地，从他那一锄一锄的热心的忙碌中里可以看清他对这刚才斗争收回的土地是多么样的亲爱，再过两三天，锄头就要换上枪了，为保卫这块土地去作战了，锄呀！锄呀！……
    到了中汪村，有七十六名要参军，里面有八个妇女。查一查村里的户数才一百七十八家，为了保卫自己的家，人人都愿暂时离开自己的家。但中汪村的干部却在费力的劝说着一些年纪稍大一点，和身体较弱的人不要去了，因为谁都知道八路军选新战士比相看新郎官还严格，三十岁开外的人就要提防人家说：岁数大了。中汪村这天劝住了十八个人别去了。
    我正见新战士赵万才被一个八路军同志问道多大岁数时，他心虚的笑着反问了：“你问这个干什么？”接着便侃侃陈辞了：“这回我去，粘也得粘住毛主席，说年岁大点，你不叫当兵，当个伙夫、马夫，铡草喂马总行，这回非去不行，……跟毛主席出点力。”三十七岁的李孟根，还有一手会修枪械的本领，但是也还有人担心他会因为年岁大给检查下来，他不高兴的说：“我买二斤胶拿去！粘上扯也扯不下来。”
    夜晚，中汪群众鼓掌欢迎初选胜利的五十几名英雄到农会去喝杯送行的酒。
    正房里满满一屋子新战士，灯火照着他们红红的脸，这也是一屋子过去受压迫，现在大翻身，今天要上前线的青壮年。像赵从善，在大前年（三十二年）一家九口人，全天共吃十二两米，给父亲吃四两米，余外每人一天一两米。吃糠、野菜度命。在光景稍好时开过馒头铺，但是保长和特权人物们干吃不给钱，生意只能往赔做。但在去年解放后，民主政府曾向他暂借公粮一百三十斤，到今年春天退还了一百二十二斤，他感叹的说：“我一年只交了八斤公粮！今年我翻了身，种着十三亩好水地！”
    干了十四年长工的赵发的也参军了。从前只有二亩不打粮食的赖沙土地。现在种七亩好地，三家伙着一个水车，自己还买一头驴，他说：“我才翻了身，蒋介石又来进犯，这是不叫咱翻身嘛！这回毛主席不给我发枪，我拿铁锨镢头也得跟他干！”
    他们举杯痛饮。
    他们一齐悲壮的唱着翻身歌。
    月光照着河北大平原，平原静悄悄。香甜的酒味凝结在这寒瑟的空气中。仔细听去可以听到附近村庄群众愤怒的歌声，而离这一里地的南汪村群众在一声紧似一声的擂着大鼓，要召开紧急会哩！
    第二天大清早，区工作员刘文彬骑着一匹枣红色的快马飞奔，我喊着问他：
    “南汪村也有人参军吗？”
    “昨晚一下子有五十多人报名，今天更要多！”他匆忙的喊着回答。
