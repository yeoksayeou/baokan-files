Two Brothers
    A Story of Joining the Army
    On September 12th, Li, the village chief of Lizhuang Village in Qin County, and several cadres were working in the village office when the Huo brothers, Huowang and Sanwang, suddenly rushed in. Everyone thought something had happened to them. Unexpectedly, the elder brother Huowang said to the village chief as soon as he entered the door, "Village chief, I am determined to join the army this time. I am here to sign up...!" Before he could finish speaking, the younger brother Sanwang interrupted and said, "Village chief, I should join the army. My elder brother is older than me, so he should stay at home to take care of things." The village chief and cadres asked, "Why are you brothers arguing like this?" Huowang said, "Our family used to be very poor, but we have just turned things around this year. Seeing that we can live a good life, Chiang Kai-shek comes to fight a civil war and steal our fruits of liberation. I have to fight Chiang Kai-shek myself. The family affairs can be left to Sanwang to manage." But Sanwang insisted again and again, saying, "I don't want to manage the house, I want to join the army!" The brothers kept arguing like this, and everyone had to put down their work and persuade them, "It's not appropriate for both of you brothers to go. There are still several children in the family who need to be cared for. It's better for Sanwang to go, he is younger, and Huowang can manage the household affairs." Huowang was not very happy at first, but after everyone persuaded him, he didn't say anything more. Amidst everyone's happy laughter, Sanwang joined the army happily.

　　两兄弟
    参军故事
    九月十二日，沁县里庄李村长和几个干部正在村公所办公，霍家兄弟虎旺和三旺突然冲进来，大家都以为他们出了什么事，谁知老大虎旺刚一进门就向村长说：“村长，这次我可要参军啦，现在我是来报名的……！”话未说完，老二三旺就抢着说：“村长，参军应该我去，我哥他年纪比我大，还是他在家照料好”。村长和干部便问：“你兄弟俩为啥这样争呢？”虎旺说：“以前咱家很穷，今年刚刚翻了身，眼看能过好日子，蒋介石就来打内战，抢我们的翻身果实，这样我非亲自和蒋介石干一场不可，家里事情可交三旺来管。”但三旺却再三坚持着说：“我不管家，我要去参军！”弟兄俩一直这样争着，大家只得放下工作，都来劝解：“你们弟兄俩都去不合适，家里还有几个小孩靠人养活，还是三旺去好些，他比较年轻，虎旺管理家务。”虎旺开始不很痛快，后经大家说服才不说什么了。三旺在大家欢乐的说笑中，高高兴兴的参军了。
