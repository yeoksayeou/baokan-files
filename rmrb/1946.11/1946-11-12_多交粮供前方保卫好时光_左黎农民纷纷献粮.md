    Contribute More Grain to the Front Lines to Defend Our Good Times
    Zuoquan and Licheng Peasants Enthusiastically Donate Grain
    [Our Newspaper’s Report] In Zuoquan, liberated peasants and labor heroes are enthusiastically donating grain when paying the public grain. Jia Fu-kui and Zhang Wu-jin, labor heroes from Tongtan, each donated 1.5 "Golden Queen" *shi* of grain, saying, "In the past two years, we only harvested about ten *shi* of grain each year. This year, we harvested seventeen or eighteen *shi*, all thanks to the leadership of the Eighth Route Army and the Communist Party in production." Li Bao-yuan, a retired soldier from Wencheng Village, said, "I cannot go to the front lines to fight, so I will donate grain to support the front lines." He donated 1.1 *shi* of corn. Guo Xian-ming and 18 other liberated peasants from the village also donated 2.6 *shi* of millet and 6.1 *shi* of corn. Li Jin-lu, a liberated hero from Songshuping, said, "We have been liberated! The Eighth Route Army is fighting at the front lines, protecting our fruits of liberation. We should provide more grain to the army so that we can completely eliminate the reactionaries." Zhao Mian-cheng and others immediately donated 4.2 *shi* of grain. The above three villages donated a total of 2.9 *shi* of rice and 11.1 *shi* of corn. (Zeng Yun, Xiu Zhen)
    [Our Newspaper’s Report from Licheng] Liberated peasants in the Fifth District of Licheng are actively contributing more public grain to support the front lines with practical actions. The Fifth District had ××× *shi* of public grain to collect, and the collection started on October 28th and was completed by the 1st of this month. Many villages have voluntarily contributed more public grain. Statistics from only four villages, Henan, Shibi-di, Houjialing, and Siding, show that they contributed an extra 626 *jin* of public grain. Zhao Xian-guo, a women's association member from Henan Village, contributed an extra 15 *jin* of public grain and said to the masses, "We are living good lives thanks to the Communist Party. If it weren't for the Communist Party, we would still be oppressed under the big feudal rock! Now that Chiang Kai-shek is attacking the liberated areas again, I will carefully sew winter clothes and make winter shoes for the militiamen, and I will contribute more public grain." Labor hero Zhao Ben-qun said, "I will contribute an extra 20 *jin* of public grain so that the Eighth Route Army can eat their fill and have more strength to kill the enemy!" The masses in Siding Village unanimously proposed, "Our village must deliver the public grain quickly and well." Village head Wang You-ding said, "To ensure the victory of the patriotic self-defense war, I will contribute an extra 50 *jin* of public grain."
