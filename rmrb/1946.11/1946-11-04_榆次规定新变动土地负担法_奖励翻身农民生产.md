Yuci Report: In order to encourage liberated peasants to work hard, increase production, and become prosperous, the Yuci County Government has stipulated the following measures for the burden on newly changed land: (1) Land obtained through mass movements after the wheat harvest will not be subject to burden this autumn but will be subject to burden starting next year. (2) Retired soldiers, regardless of whether they are from this county or elsewhere (including the KMT-occupied areas), who need to rebuild their homes in this county, will not be subject to burden for two years; those who receive grain to take home are exceptions. (3) Land obtained in mass movements before the wheat harvest will be converted to standard mu at eight-tenths of the original mu. (4) In order to reduce the burden on the people, agricultural production by all institutions will be subject to a burden of 5% of the actual income; individual production of two mu or more will be subject to burden for one person per household, while those below two mu will not be subject to burden. (Ping Tao)

Anyang Report: In the Shijian and Shuangquan base areas of the Sixth District of Anyang, more than ten villages have a total of 3,280 mu of wasteland. Due to the realization of "land to the tiller," all of it has now been reclaimed by the masses into fertile land. When Shijian and six other villages started land reclamation, they only had 27 head of cattle, but they reclaimed 460 mu of wasteland in three days. The Shuangquan base area reclaimed 1,110 mu in one week. During the land reclamation period, male and female laborers in each village were organized, with women clearing thorns and men handling plows and harrows, and their enthusiasm was extraordinarily high.
