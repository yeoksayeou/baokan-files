    General Qiao Mingli and Others
    Send a Telegram to General Xi Shengkai
    [This newspaper reports] General Qiao Mingli, commander of the First Army of the Democratic National Construction Army, and others, recently sent a telegram to General Xi Shengkai, former deputy brigade commander of the 92nd Brigade (originally a division) of the Chiang army who laid down their weapons in the previous Subei Campaign. The original telegram is as follows:
    Respected Senior Schoolmate Xi Shengkai: We have been separated for several years and deeply miss you. In the previous Subei Campaign, we were delighted to hear that you led your troops to lay down their weapons, an act of great righteousness that is as magnificent as the mountains and rivers. As the saying goes, "The benevolent are surely brave"; it is also said that one should "make decisive decisions when the opportunity arises," so this old friend is very happy indeed. From now on, the revolutionary ranks will have one more strong person, which is fortunate for our personal friendship. @ With respectful regards, we wish you peace! Your younger brothers, Qiao Mingli and Yan Chengzhen, respectfully bow.
