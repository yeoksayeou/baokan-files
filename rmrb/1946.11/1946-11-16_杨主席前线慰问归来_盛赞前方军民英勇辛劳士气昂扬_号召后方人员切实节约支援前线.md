    [Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] Chairman Yang of the Border Region Government, representing the people of the Border Region and the rear staff, returned the other day in the rain after completing a mission to visit the soldiers and civilians fighting hard on the front lines of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region. Although Chairman Yang had traveled a long distance, visiting various headquarters, companies, hospitals, and individual affected villages during the day, and traveling at night, even unable to sleep all day, his spirit remained as usual. Chairman Yang said: "Over the past twenty days, I have experienced both the front lines and the rear, and deeply appreciate the bravery and hard work of our troops in combat, their high morale, and the hard work of hospitals and supply stations in mobilizing war support, fully supporting the front lines, which moved and excited me." Chairman Yang continued: "The frontline soldiers have not rested for four months, fighting under the intense artillery fire of the US-Chiang alliance. The morale of the troops is high, and their spirits are cheerful. Whenever they meet commanders and political commissars, they express that eliminating the enemy is not enough; they want to find opportunities to eliminate even more enemies." Chairman Yang visited more than 4,000 wounded soldiers and happily said, "Medical staff are implementing new treatment methods to reduce the pain of the wounded, save manpower and resources, and allow them to quickly be discharged and return to the front lines, which is a creation." Chairman Yang paid special attention to the cultural food and entertainment of the wounded: "The wounded cannot get books to read, and their spirits cannot be further relaxed." He has instructed the Education Department to join forces with the Border Region's cultural organizations to raise books from the masses and send them to the front lines. The spirit of unity from top to bottom on the Hebei-Shandong-Henan front, with everything serving the war, is particularly worthy of reward. In his farewell letter "to the political and civilian workers of the Hebei-Luyu Military Region," Chairman Yang said: "Many comrades personally lead stretcher teams to the front lines, personally preside over supply station work, personally work with the broad masses to rush to harvest and plant crops, many comrades take the lead in joining the army, and many comrades work while ill, which is deeply admirable." Finally, Chairman Yang called upon: The Hebei-Shandong-Henan front is fighting fiercely against the fascist "human army" on one side, and struggling against the fascist "water army" (Yellow River) on the other, greatly depleting civilian resources. Due to the war, not much wheat has been planted. Fortunately, the frontline troops helped with the rush work, and the autumn harvest has not been affected. However, long-term war requires long-term planning. All rear personnel must work hard, face the war, and once again emphasize the need for economy, accurately calculate manpower and resources, save on food and expenses, supply the front lines, and strive for final victory.

    杨主席前线慰问归来
    盛赞前方军民英勇辛劳士气昂扬
    号召后方人员切实节约支援前线
    【本报特讯】边区政府杨主席代表边区人民及后方工作人员赴冀鲁豫前线慰问艰苦作战之军民，任务完成，于日前冒雨返回。杨主席虽经长途跋涉，且每日白天赴各司令部各连队各医院及个别受灾村庄慰问，夜间行走，甚至整日不能入眠，但精神仍如常。杨主席称：“二十多天曾经历火线后方，深刻体会我们部队作战之英勇辛劳，士气之昂扬，医院与兵站战勤动员之艰苦，全力支援前线，使我感动与兴奋。”杨主席继称：“前线将士四个月来未能休息，在美蒋强烈炮火下作战，部队士气盛旺，精神愉快，每遇司令员及政治委员时，他们都表示消灭敌人不够，要找机会消灭更多敌人。”杨主席慰问了四千余位伤员，喜欢的说：“医务人员实行新治疗法，减轻伤员疼痛，又节约人力物力，迅速出院再上火线，是一个创造。”杨主席特别关心伤员的文化食粮与文化娱乐：“伤员看书而不得，精神上不能更加轻松。”已指示教育厅，联合边区文化机关向群众募集图书，送往前线。冀鲁豫前线上下一致，一切服务于战争之精神，特别值得奖励，杨主席在临别“向冀鲁军区政民工作人员致慰”信里称：“许多同志亲率担架上火线，亲自主持兵站工作，亲自动手和广大群众抢收抢种，许多同志带头参军，许多同志抱病工作，深值敬佩。”最后杨主席号召：冀鲁豫前线一面抗击法西斯的“人军”，一面与法西斯的“水军”（黄河）苦斗，民力消耗很大，因战争关系，麦子种的不多，幸而前线军队帮助突击，秋收尚未影响，但长期战争，须要长期打算，一切后方人员，必须紧张工作，面对战争，再次强调提出节约，精确计算人力物力，省吃俭用，供应前线，争取最后的胜利。
