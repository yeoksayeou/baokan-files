Editor's Note: The author, Mr. Zhang Yisheng, was originally a Major Propaganda Officer in the Political Department of the 187th Brigade (original division) of the 65th Division (original army) of Chiang's army. Opposing the civil war, he defected to the New Fourth Army on July 13th after the division was transferred from Jiangnan to Jingjiang in central Jiangsu. He had previously published a letter to all officers and soldiers of the 65th Division, calling for opposition to the civil war. Mr. Zhang is currently working in a unit of the New Fourth Army. This article is his recent work and is introduced below. The phrase "our army" in the text refers to the New Fourth Army.

	The advantages of American weapons in terms of performance have only a small relative significance. At the same time, they can also produce many opposing weaknesses. First, the higher the degree of mechanization of the American-equipped units, the greater their reliance on transportation lines and vehicles. When Chiang's army penetrates deep into the liberated areas, its rear transportation lines are constantly threatened and lack the manpower required for transport. Under these circumstances, mechanized equipment completely loses its due activity. Second, American-equipped forces have the characteristics of speed and mobility, but they can only help Chiang's army in point-line operations. In the liberated areas where vast ground is controlled by our army and people, Chiang's army completely loses room to maneuver. For example, when Chiang's 63rd Division fought in central Jiangsu and the 74th Division attacked Lianshui, they could only advance a few miles a day. Third, American-equipped units must increase various firepower units (units directly under the command of various levels of headquarters), and the number of horses and vehicles is also several times higher. This large and cumbersome organization places a burden on the command organs whether in marching, camping, or fighting. When the troops are in a slightly adverse situation, it often immediately causes chaos. For example, Chiang's 49th Division was annihilated in central Jiangsu for this reason. Later, the 21st Division's New 7th Brigade and the 65th Division's 187th Brigade did not dare to deploy artillery. But in this way, the firepower of the troops was weakened, and in the end, they could not avoid being annihilated. Fourth, American-equipped troops easily develop a mentality of relying on American weapons. In action, they cannot fight without the cooperation of aircraft and artillery, they cannot endure long-distance marches without cars and ships, and they easily waver when contact is lost or when they do not receive assistance, even if there is contact. Combat quality is greatly reduced. Fifth, it takes a lot of time to train troops to use American weapons. Most of the American-equipped Chiang's army has now been trained by American officers. Due to the lack of reference books on new weapons, the varying levels of education of the officers and soldiers receiving education, and the emotional separation between the teaching parties, it is impossible to train them well in a short period of time. Although American weapons have strong firepower and great impetus, the casualties and losses in combat are also large, and replenishment is very difficult. This is by no means an easy problem to solve today when Chiang Kai-shek has great ambitions but small forces. For example, the 7th and 11th Traffic Police Regiments of Chiang's army were just equipped in Shanghai at the end of July, and they were sent to central Jiangsu to fight in early August. As a result, they were annihilated by our army in Dinglinzi. Sixth, although American weapons can easily organize firepower and exert firepower, they are also subject to certain restrictions: (1) Due to the difficulty of transportation and the large amount of American ammunition that must rely on the United States, which Chiang's army cannot manufacture, officers warn soldiers to save ammunition before the troops depart for battle, which contradicts the exertion of firepower. But in fact, Chiang's army did not save ammunition. According to He Sheng, a sergeant squad leader of the 3rd Battalion, 171st Regiment, 57th Brigade of the 74th Division of Chiang's army, who was just liberated from the Lianshui battle: the battalion defended the sandy beach of the Yu Huang River bank, and consumed more than 3,500 shells in one night alone. Chiang's soldiers often secretly threw away ammunition to reduce their burden, because the weight of soldiers after new equipment increased from more than 30 jin to more than 50 jin. (2) If the combat troops concentrate all the livestock, mechanical power, and manpower to transport ammunition, it will be difficult to take care of the supply of grain. For example, when Chiang's 74th Division attacked Lianshui, its frontline officers and soldiers departed from Huai on October 19th and spent ten days until they were resolved under the city of Lianshui. Lu Shiguang, a sergeant squad leader of the 57th Brigade of the division, said after being liberated: "Who knows what ghosts they are doing, saying they will deliver food every day, but they haven't seen it delivered!" (3) Because American weapons are unconditionally assigned and have no replacements, they become waste if they encounter obstacles. For example, in the Battle of Lianshui, the 74th Division of Chiang's army fought fiercely with our army on the sandy beach of the Yu Huang River without using various weapons. Due to the intrusion of sand particles, dozens of American-made small guns were destroyed. (4) The firepower of American weapons needs to rely on fortifications to exert its power. After this habit is formed, soldiers cannot fight without leaving the fortifications, and they cannot fight in close combat.

    蒋军手中的美国武器
    张易生
    编者按：作者张易生氏，原为蒋军六十五师（原军）一八七旅（原师）政治部少校宣传干事，因反对内战于七月十三日随该师自江南北调苏中靖江后，即自动投奔新四军，曾发表告六十五师全体官兵书，号召反对内战。现张氏在新四军某部任职，本文为其近作，兹转介绍于后。文中“我军”皆系指新四军。                
    美式武器性能上的优点，只有很少一点相对上的意义，在这同时，也可产生许多相反的弱点。第一，美械装备部队的机械化程度愈高，其依靠交通线和运输工具也愈甚。蒋军深入解放区，其后方交通线经常被破坏威胁，且缺乏输送所需的人力。在这种情况下的机械化装备，完全失却它应有的活动。第二，美械装备有快速和机动的特性，但也只能帮助蒋军点线作战。在广大的地面都由我军民控制的解放区内，蒋军广大的部队完全失却周旋余地。例如蒋军六十三师在苏中作战，七十四师进攻涟水时，均只能日行数里。第三，美械装备部队必须增加各种火力单位（各级司令部直属队），马匹车辆也多出好几倍。这种庞大而又笨滞的组织，无论行军宿营作战都给指挥机关以一种负累。当部队稍入逆境时，往往立即引起混乱状态。例如蒋军四十九师在苏中即因此而被歼，其后二十一师新七旅及六十五师一八七旅都不敢配置大炮。但这样一来，又削弱了部队的火力，结果还是免不掉被歼的命运。第四，美械部队很容易养成官兵依仗美械的心理，行动上没有飞机大炮的配合就不能作战，没有汽车汽船远程行军就要吃不消，上下失却联系，或虽有联系而得不到援助时，就容易动摇等等。战斗素质大大减弱。第五，部队使用美械作战的训练要花上很多时间，现在美械蒋军大部经过美国军官训练，由于新兵器参考书少，接受教育的官兵程度参差和教学双方感情的隔阂，不是短时期所能训练好的。虽然美械火力强，冲力大，但因此作战时伤亡损失亦大，补充很困难。这在今天蒋介石野心大兵力小的情况下，决不是一件容易解决的事。例如蒋交通警察第七第十一两个总队，七月底在上海刚装备好，八月初即开来苏中作战，结果被我军歼灭于丁林梓。第六，美械虽容易组织火力，发扬火力，但也受着一定条件的限制：（一）由于交通运输困难及美械弹药大量须依赖美国，蒋军无法制造，所以当部队出发作战前，其官长都以节省弹药告诫士兵，这就与发扬火力相矛盾了。但事实上蒋军并未节省弹药。据涟水战役刚解放过来的蒋军七十四师五十七旅一七一团三营中士班长何胜称：该营防守淤黄河岸沙滩，一夜间仅炮弹消耗三千五百余发。蒋军士兵还常常暗中将弹药丢掉，以减轻负担，因新装备后士兵负重从三十多斤增至五十多斤。（二）如果作战部队集中所有畜力机械力人力用以运输弹药，粮食的供应将难以兼顾。例如蒋军七十四师进攻涟水，其第一线官兵十月十九日从淮出发，直到涟水城下被解决前后，费时十天。该师五十七旅中士班长吕士广解放过来后说：“谁知道他们捣的什么鬼，天天说送来还没有见送过粮食来！”（三）因为美械都无条件配属，没有替换，如万一遇障碍，就成废物。例如涟水之战中，蒋军七十四师在淤黄河沙滩与我军激战未用各种武器，因沙粒侵入而发生故障，有数十门美造小炮因而炸毁。（四）美械的火力需依靠工事才能发扬，此习惯养成后，士兵离开工事，战斗就不行，肉搏更不行。
