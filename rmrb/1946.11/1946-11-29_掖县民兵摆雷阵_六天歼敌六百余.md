Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 24th: Militia and armed work teams along the Jiaoji Railway have launched a campaign of explosions and political offensives. From the 6th to the 11th, the Yexian militia distributed 3,000 leaflets, detonated 240 landmines, and killed or wounded 600 Chiang soldiers. Explosion expert Shi Xiaomin and militia model Wang Tonggui, along with 14 other explosion teams, deployed landmine arrays in places like Fenzi Mountain on the outskirts of Yexian City, killing or wounding more than 260 Chiang soldiers. Fenzi Mountain is only ten li from Yexian City. When Chiang's troops invaded the county seat from Fenzi Mountain, they were deeply afraid of the roaring landmines and used long bamboo poles with stones attached to search the ground all day before occupying the empty city of Yexian. The Huantai militia killed or wounded a total of 68 Chiang soldiers in four explosions. On the 23rd of last month, a Chiang army battalion commander was blown into the sky along with his car by a landmine while traveling on the Longhe Bridge. Xi Nan, the armed forces minister of Linqing County, led 11 militiamen and repelled an invasion by more than 300 Chiang soldiers. The Shouguang-style work team launched a propaganda campaign of shouting at Chiang's army strongholds, disintegrating over 100 men of the puppet Zhang Linke unit.
