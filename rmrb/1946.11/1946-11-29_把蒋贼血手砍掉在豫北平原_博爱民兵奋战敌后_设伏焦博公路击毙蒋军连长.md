　　Bo'ai Militia Fight Behind Enemy Lines
    Ambush on the Jiaozuo-Bo'ai Highway, Killing a Chiang Army Company Commander
    [Special Dispatch from Bo'ai by this Newspaper] "Cut off Chiang Kai-shek's bloody hands on the North Henan Plain!" This is the determination of the people of Bo'ai to defend their homes and defeat the Chiang bandits. After a year of struggle for liberation, the people of Bo'ai have realized "land to the tiller." When the bloody hands of the big tyrant Chiang Kai-shek reached out, they rose up to defend themselves with a high degree of awareness. The invading Chiang army met with resolute resistance everywhere. The militia in various districts formed capable armed work teams, going deep behind enemy lines to strike at the enemy puppets and "Homecoming Legions." Twenty militiamen in the Sixth District repelled over a hundred enemy soldiers who were looting grain at Jiu Fu Tomb; the Xu Liang militia in Da Xin Village repelled three enemy disturbances; three militiamen from Qiaogou repelled over a hundred invading Chiang soldiers with cold shots. These heroic struggles further inspired the people's confidence in victory and determination to fight. When the chairman of the Eastern Jincheng Farmers' Association in the Fourth District was captured by the Chiang army, he shouted along the way, "The Communist Party is my family, I will never yield to you!" At the puppet district office, some local despots and landlords asked him, "Why did you struggle against us, will you still struggle?" He resolutely replied loudly, "You extorted our houses and land, of course, we will struggle, and we will continue to struggle when we get back!" The Chiang puppets could do nothing with him and decided to bury him alive. That night, our militia and troops fought into the puppet district office and rescued him. An old lady in Jifang Village, upon hearing that the district head who led her to turn over had been captured by the enemy, was restless day and night and inquired everywhere. Later, when she saw the district head again, she happily said, "I was worried for days, I feel relieved only after seeing you." The people are filled with love for the militia and armed work teams who lead them in the struggle, often caring to send food, water, and intelligence. When they see them, they surround them, asking about everything, filled with confidence in victory. A saying is circulating among the people: "Zhangde, Weihui, Huai, it will be hard for you Chiang Kai-shek to get in and even harder to get out!"

    [Dispatch from Changzhi by this Newspaper] The militia of the Fifth District of Bo'ai, under the leadership of district cadres Yu Yuqi and Shi Huamin, ambushed the Jiaozuo-Bo'ai Highway near Guitun Village on the 15th of this month. At 4 PM, Dai Hong'an, the lieutenant company commander of the Seventh Company, Third Battalion, 531st Regiment, 177th Division of the Chiang Army, was escorting civilian laborers and vehicles from the east transporting coal. Our militia suddenly attacked, catching the enemy off guard. Except for the lieutenant company commander who was killed on the spot by us, all the rest were captured by our militia, and ten civilian laborers were liberated. A total of eight head of livestock, five carts of coal, one rickshaw, four gold rings looted from the masses, several ducks, and many other coats, leather bags, fountain pens, military insurance knives, and important documents were seized. The county headquarters issued a special order to commend them. The militia in the district are now in high spirits to kill the enemy. In the gaps between battles, they also automatically learn how to bury and install landmines, and have learned fifteen kinds of landmine burying methods. On the night of the 11th, they tried out the explosion for the first time near Guitun Village, killing one Chiang soldier. They are preparing to create even greater explosion victories.
