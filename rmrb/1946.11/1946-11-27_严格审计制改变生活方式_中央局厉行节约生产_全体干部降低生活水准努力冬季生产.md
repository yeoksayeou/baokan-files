　　Strict Auditing System Changes Lifestyle
    Central Bureau Practices Thrift and Production
    All Cadres Lower Living Standards and Strive for Winter Production
    [Our newspaper, Handan, 22nd dispatch] The Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Central Bureau is currently actively changing the lifestyle of its organs and practicing thrift and production to adapt to the long-term and sustained war. Since September, the financial budget of the organ has implemented a strict auditing system. Each department of the organ must determine its total monthly budget based on precise calculations, and then formulate the overall organ budget based on the budgets of each department. A strict inspection will be conducted at the end of the month, and no department will be allowed to exceed the budget at will, in order to overcome the past crude and careless work style that did not pay attention to calculation. In terms of thrift, it is necessary to make full use of all existing materials. The Central Bureau organ has made great achievements in the past six months. The utilization of old clothes, old quilts, waste paper, and other items alone has saved an expenditure of 2 million yuan. Savings on daily necessities such as towels and soap have also reached 150,000 yuan. Currently, all cadres, in response to Comrade Liu Shaoqi's call to "change the lifestyle," have begun to lower their living standards. The organ's small and medium-sized kitchens have been merged, and everyone eats collectively in the large kitchen to reduce expenses and waste. The use of lamp oil and office supplies in each unit is being saved under the principle of precise calculation. Winter stoves will also be reduced as much as possible. Now, cadres of all organs are actively participating in various winter production activities such as cutting white grass, spinning cotton, and weaving wool. Each cadre has prepared their own winter production plan, stipulating that each person must turn in a production task of 500 to 600 yuan during the winter. Comrades in the secretariat have already begun spinning and weaving. The white grass cutting movement is continuing to develop. In just three days, 1,200 jin of white grass have been cut, solving the problem of winter bedding for the cadres. Other production activities are also currently being carried out enthusiastically.

    【本报邯郸二十二日电】晋冀鲁豫中央局目前正积极改变机关生活，厉行节约生产，以适应长期持久的战争。从九月份起，该机关财经预算，已实行严格审计制度。凡机关每一部门，必须根据精确计算，定出该部门的全月预算，然后再根据各部门预算制定总的机关预算，月终进行严格检查，决不允许任何部门随意超过预算，以克服过去不注意计算的粗枝大叶作风。在节约方面，要充分利用一切旧有物资，半年来中央局机关是有很大成绩的，仅旧衣旧被废纸等各项的利用，即节省开支二百万元。手巾肥皂等日用品的节省，亦达十五万元。现全体干部，又在响应刘少奇同志“改变生活方式”的号召下，开始降低生活水平。机关小灶与中灶已实行合并，大伙房一律集体吃饭，以减少开支浪费，各单位灯油及办公用具，都在精确计算原则下，进行节省。冬季炉火，亦拟尽量减少。现在各机关干部，又积极参加了割白草、纺花、毛织等各种冬季生产的运动中。每个干部都制好了自己的冬季生产计划，并规定每人冬季要交公五百元至六百元的生产任务。秘书处的同志，已开始纺织，割白草运动正继续开展，仅三天中，即已割回白草一千二百斤，解决了各干部的冬季铺草问题。其他各项生产，目前亦正热烈的进行。
