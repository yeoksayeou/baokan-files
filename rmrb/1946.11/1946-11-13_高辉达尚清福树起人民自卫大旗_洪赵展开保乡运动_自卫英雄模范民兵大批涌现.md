    [This newspaper's Yangcheng, 11th dispatch] Amidst the indomitable struggle against Chiang Kai-shek's invading troops, the people of Hongdong and Zhaocheng Counties have witnessed the emergence of countless self-defense heroes, led by Gao Huida and Shang Qingfu. A widespread "Gao Huida, Shang Qingfu Movement" to defend their hometowns has been launched by the broad masses of people in the two counties. When Chiang's troops invaded Hongdong territory, despite their careful "simultaneous advance" with six brigades, they continuously suffered cold gunfire from Gao Huida and Shang Qingfu, with over thirty killed or wounded on the first day, and twenty-two wounded soldiers abandoned. Subsequently, they were subjected to continuous attacks and harassment. Gao Huida is from ×× Village in Zhaocheng. He suffered immensely in the old society and has turned his life around since liberation. He is irreconcilably opposed to the dark rule of Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan, knowing that only by cooperating with the Eighth Route Army to defend the liberated areas and his hometown can he survive. When he heard that Jin Guoqi, a secret agent who had once tried to kill him, had returned to harm the villagers, he resolutely said: "Kill Jin Guoqi and his ilk, eliminate these pawns of Chiang Kai-shek!" From then on, wherever there were Chiang's troops and secret agent armed forces, there was Gao Huida and the sound of his gun. Shang Qingfu, an old hero from the War of Resistance against Japan, organized explosive squads and sharpshooters after Chiang's troops invaded, actively disrupting the telecommunications between Chiang's troop outposts along the railway lines. Under the influence of Gao Huida and Shang Qingfu, many self-defense heroes and model militia teams have emerged. For example, self-defense hero Cui Hengyuan killed three Chiang's soldiers in an ambush. Tian Manggan once killed a Chiang's troop platoon leader and two others with stone mines. On the 11th of last month, the militia, in coordination with local armed forces, launched a night attack on Xingbao Village, killing or wounding seven secret agents. On the 1st of this month, the famous ×× Village militia platoon attacked Quting, killing or wounding six Chiang's troops. On the 3rd, a militia unit ambushed Baicun, capturing one Chiang's soldier alive. The Hongdong and Zhaocheng County Command has called on the people of the entire county to learn from Gao Huida and Shang Qingfu. The people of Hongdong and Zhaocheng have firmly stated that under the leadership of these two banners, they will drive out Chiang Kai-shek's invading troops!

    高辉达尚清福树起人民自卫大旗
    洪赵展开保乡运动
    自卫英雄模范民兵大批涌现
    【本报阳城十一日电】洪（洞）赵（城）人民在与蒋介石进犯军进行不屈的斗争中，涌现了以高辉达、尚清福为首的无数自卫英雄，两县广大人民普遍展开了保卫家乡的“高辉达、尚清福运动”。蒋军侵入洪洞地界时，虽以六个旅小心翼翼地“齐头并进”，沿途仍不断遭受高辉达和尚清福们的冷枪射击，第一天即被毙伤三十余名，遗弃伤兵二十二名。其后更不断遭到袭击和困扰。高辉达是赵城××村人，在旧社会里受尽磨折，解放后已翻了身，他与蒋介石、阎锡山的黑暗统治势不两立，知道只有配合八路军保卫解放区，保卫自己的家乡，才能活下去。当他听说从前曾要杀死他的特务晋国奇又回来残害乡里时，就坚决的说：“打死晋国奇们，打掉这些蒋介石的爪牙！”从此凡有蒋军和特务武装的地方，就有高辉达和他的枪声。抗日战争中的老英雄尚清福，在蒋军侵入后，就组织了爆炸手和神枪手，活跃在铁路线上，不断破坏蒋军据点间的电讯交通。在高辉达和尚清福影响下，涌现了不少自卫英雄和模范民兵队，如自卫英雄崔恒元在一次伏击中，一个人就击毙蒋军三人，田忙干一次就用石雷炸死蒋军排长以下三人，上月十一日，民兵配合地方武装夜袭幸堡村，毙伤特务队七名。本月一日，著名的××村民兵班，袭击曲亭，毙伤蒋军六名，三日，一部民兵在白村设伏，活捉蒋军一名。洪赵两县指挥部号召全县人民学习高辉达和尚清福，洪赵人民坚决表示一定在这两杆旗帜的领导下，把蒋介石进犯军赶出去！
