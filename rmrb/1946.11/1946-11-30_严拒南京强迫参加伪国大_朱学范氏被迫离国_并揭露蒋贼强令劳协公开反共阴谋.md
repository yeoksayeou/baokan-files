Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 26th: The Shanghai newspapers of the 18th published a statement by Zhu Xuefan, Chairman of the Chinese Labor Association (Note: This agency previously published a brief summary of the statement). The statement was issued in English in Hong Kong on the 16th and signed by Zhu. The content is as follows:

    "Because the government has continuously attempted to destroy the unity of the labor community, forced the Chinese Labor Association to exclude the labor unions in the Liberated Areas from its organization, and forced the Chinese Labor Association to publicly oppose Communism, which this association believes is unnecessary, I have no choice but to leave China. The government forced me to participate in the undemocratic, one-party Kuomintang National Assembly, which I absolutely do not recognize as representing the wishes of the people of the whole country. The government is dissatisfied with my actions and wants to fabricate charges to arrest me immediately. The government also attempted to issue a public announcement in the name of the Labor Association opposing the Communist Party and the Democratic League, but this was not agreed to by the Chinese Labor Association, nor is it permissible to the workers. I left Shanghai for Hong Kong because the situation was critical and it was difficult to continue activities in Shanghai, but I will continue to work tirelessly in my struggle."

　　严拒南京强迫参加伪国大
    朱学范氏被迫离国
    并揭露蒋贼强令劳协公开反共阴谋
    【新华社延安二十六日电】十八日上海讯：此间报纸刊载中国劳动协会理事长朱学范氏之声明（按该声明本社前曾发表简略摘要），该声明系于十六日在香港以英文发表，末由朱氏签名，内容如下：
    由于政府不断企图摧毁劳工界的统一，强迫中国劳动协会排斥解放区工会于其组织之外，并强迫中国劳动协会公开反共，而本会认为无此必要，本人为此只有离开中国。政府强迫本人参加非民主的一党国民大会，而此一党国民大会本人绝不承认其为代表全国人民的愿望。政府对我此举不满，想伪造罪名，立即将本人予以逮捕。政府又企假借劳协名义发表一公告反对共党及民盟，但此绝非中国劳动协会所同意，亦绝非工人所能许可。本人离沪赴港，系因形势危殆，难于在沪继续活动，但本人奋斗仍将努力不懈。
