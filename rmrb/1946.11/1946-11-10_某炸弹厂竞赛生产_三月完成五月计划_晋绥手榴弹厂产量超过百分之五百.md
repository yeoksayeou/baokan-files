　　(From our correspondent in Changzhi, 5th) The second production increase campaign launched by the ×× Bomb Factory in early August was completed at the end of October. In three months, it successfully completed the production plan for five months, ensuring the supply of munitions to the front lines. The current production volume has reached 200 percent of the spring production volume this year, and the quality has also improved, with extremely strong export explosive power. During the campaign, workers labored selflessly, as bravely as the soldiers on the front lines. Worker Wang Qingxiang said: "The more bombs we make, the more enemies we eliminate; the sooner we defeat the reactionaries, the sooner we will have peace." The workers went to work early and left work late every day. To save time, some did not go home for meals, but brought dry food. The intense work made them forget Sundays, sacrificed their afternoon naps, and voluntarily increased their voluntary work hours. Worker Hu Jian insisted on working despite suffering from scabies that had caused his whole body to swell; sand-casting worker Li Hezhi, known as "Old Huang Zhong," did not leave his furnace no matter how hot the weather was. After being burned, he went back to work before he was fully recovered. In May, new carpenter Guo Wanlu only produced 80 grenade handles per day, but now he produces 420. Young worker Li Shufa used to turn 180 wooden handles a day, but now he has created an amazing record of turning 720 a day. At the same time, the workers displayed a high degree of intelligence, researching and creating and improving three kinds of tools day and night, which increased production and saved a lot of raw materials such as coal, beeswax, and realgar. At the end of October, Director Cheng of the Political Department of the Second Sub-district of Taihang specially brought a bonus of 30,000 yuan to the factory to express his regards and encouragement. Also: The factory recently summarized its production achievements for the half-year from May to October and formulated a production plan for November and December. The first production increase campaign in May and June completed the production plan for three months. This time, three months completed the production plan for five months. In total, the production plan for nine months has been completed in half a year. A large number of labor heroes and model workers such as Wang Qingxiang, Li Hezhi, Li Shufa, Li Xiaolan, and Hu Jian have emerged among the workers. On October 31, when the entire factory discussed the new production plan, everyone had full confidence and guaranteed to complete three to four times the monthly production volume of bombs in the next two months.

　　(Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 5th) In October, the grenade manufacturing factory under the Industrial Department of the Jin-Sui Military Region, with the same labor force, had a grenade output that exceeded the previous month by 538 percent. Wang Zhanyuan, a 17-year-old apprentice, created the highest record of manufacturing 700 grenade shells in nine hours. After worker An Shuangxiu initiated a factory-wide competition with conditions such as automatic processing exceeding the plan, the workers automatically requested to cancel Sunday rest. They said: "How can we care about Sunday when the front is fighting?!" And they automatically requested to work overtime, increasing the daily work hours from nine to thirteen or fourteen hours. Repair shops in Yanmen, Lüliang, and other places generally exceeded the previous month's output by 50 percent. The shoe factory completed 70,000 pairs of cotton shoes one month ahead of schedule and sent them to the front lines. Last month, each person in the textile factory weaved more than four zhang of cloth a day, and this month the output has increased by more than 30 percent.
