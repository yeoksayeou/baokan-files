    New War Kindled in Liaoji Area

    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 14th: According to a dispatch from Agence France-Presse in Beiping on the 10th, military observers here believe that the implementation of the "ceasefire order" is extremely difficult. The order states that "defensive" actions are excluded, but any military action can be interpreted as "defensive." Furthermore, according to a special telegram from the Nanjing Xinmin Daily in Tianjin on the 10th, Tianjin is still extensively collecting grain and conscripting soldiers. After the news of the "ceasefire order" reached here, the general public was not happy. "This cannot conceal the dark future indicated by the forced grain requisition!"
    Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 14th: On the third day after Chiang Kai-shek issued the so-called "ceasefire order" (the 10th), Chiang's troops in the Liaoji area again kindled a new war. On the 10th, the 264th Regiment of the 88th Division of Chiang's 71st Army in Liaoyuan, accompanied by 40 vehicles, invaded north and captured Huangcun Town. On the afternoon of the 11th, the "effective" date of Chiang Kai-shek's so-called "ceasefire order," Maolin was continuously occupied. On the 12th, Sanlin, 30 li north of Maolin, was occupied. The above-mentioned areas are all on the railway line from Liaoyuan to Kaitong. In order to defend peace in the Northeast, the Democratic Allied Army is counterattacking the invading Chiang troops, and fierce fighting has already begun in the area.
    Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 14th: The 15th Division of the 73rd Army, the 193rd Division Guard Brigade, and the Provisional 14th Division of the 96th Army, Chiang's troops entrenched in Linzi and other places in the central section of the Jiaoji Railway, in order to cooperate with the Chiang troops in the eastern section of the Jiaoji Railway in attacking the Jiaodong Liberated Area, invaded the Bohai Area in separate routes on the 9th and 10th, after Chiang Kai-shek announced the so-called "ceasefire order," successively occupying the three cities of Shouguang, Huantai, and Qidong, attempting to control the rich area north of the Xiaqing River on the Jiaoji Road. The Bohai Eighth Route Army rose up in self-defense, and on the evening of the 10th, launched a fierce attack on Shouguang City, and recovered the city in one fell swoop. Chiang's troops left behind more than 60 bodies and fled in panic.

    “停战令”就是“宣战令”
    辽吉地区挑起新战火
    临淄蒋军窜犯渤海区
    我军反击收复寿光
    【新华社延安十四日电】据法国新闻处北平十日电讯称：“停战令”到平后，此间军事观察家认为是项命令之实行极感困难，命令中说“防卫”行动除外；而任何军事行动均可解释系为“防卫”。又据南京新民报十日天津专电称：天津仍在大肆征粮抓丁，“停战令”消息传抵此间后，一般人并不惊喜。盖“此事并掩盖不了拉丁征粮所显示的黑暗前路！”
    【新华社东北十四日电】蒋介石颁布所谓“停战令”后的第三日（十日），辽吉地区蒋军又挑起新的战火。十日辽源蒋七十一军八八师二六四团，附汽车四十辆北犯，侵陷黄村镇。蒋介石所谓“停战令”的“生效”日十一日下午，已被继续占茂林。十二日，占茂林北卅里之三林。上述各地均在辽源至开通铁路线上，民主联军为保卫东北和平，反击进犯蒋军，现激战已在该地展开。
    【新华社山东十四日电】盘踞胶济中段临淄等地蒋军七十三军十五师、一九三师警卫旅及九十六军暂十四师等部，为配合胶济东段蒋军之进攻胶东解放区，于蒋介石宣布所谓“停战令”后之九日、十日两日分路窜犯渤海区，先后侵占寿光、桓台、齐东三城，企图控制胶济路北小清河南之富饶地区。渤海八路军奋起自卫，于十日晚猛扑寿光城，并一举收复该城，蒋军遗尸六十余具，狼狈逃窜。
