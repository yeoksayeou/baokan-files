    Visiting Brigade Commander Liu Guangxin
    Qi Yu
    Brigade Commander Liu Guangxin (formerly Division Commander) of the 119th Brigade of the Chiang army, who laid down his arms in the Battle of Juancheng, arrived at a certain place on the 5th. General Liu Bocheng, Chief of Staff Li Da, and several other comrades visited him separately. Brigade Commander Liu is tall and strong, wearing a light gray cotton military uniform, with a shaved head. Originally, he was wearing an American-style flat-topped round officer's hat with gold trim, but he dropped it on the way to General Liu Bocheng's headquarters. The first time it fell, the escorting soldier picked it up for him; the second time, while crossing a small ditch, he fell hard into the deep water from his horse, and told the soldier not to pick up that "hat of national subjugation" again. Now he has a new blue cotton hat.
    In a spacious room, the sunlight was shining on Brigade Commander Liu's rosy, glowing face. When the reporter visited, he was reading various books and newspapers at his desk. Although it was the first meeting, perhaps because of his straightforward and frank personality? The conversation was unconstrained, like a pleasant heart-to-heart talk with a long-lost friend. Brigade Commander Liu frankly narrated that when he first laid down his arms on the battlefield and met our army, he only admitted to being a second lieutenant adjutant. Later, seeing that our commanders and fighters were very polite and treated him very thoughtfully in terms of living conditions, he was very touched. He felt that the rumors he had heard before about how he would be treated if captured by the Eighth Route Army were all lies. So, he told his real name and expressed his willingness to visit the Liberated Area.
    Brigade Commander Liu is thirty-nine years old this year and is from Taihe County, Anhui Province. In 1925, when he was seventeen years old, he joined Liu Ruming's army in Beiping. In his twenty years of military life, he rose from a soldier to a division commander. After the reorganization, he served as the brigade commander of the 119th Brigade. He participated in the Great Revolution and expressed his anger at Chiang Kai-shek's consistent policy of eliminating miscellaneous troops. He said that the Northwest Army created by Mr. Feng Yuxiang had a glorious revolutionary tradition. Whether in the era of the Great Revolution or in the eight-year War of Resistance against Japan, it made great contributions to the country and the nation. However, Chiang Kai-shek did not reward the troops who contributed to the country and the nation, but rather bought them over, divided them, annexed them, reorganized them, and destroyed and eliminated them. This downsizing was particularly severe. Perhaps it was because this army had once loved the country and resisted Japan? He pointed out that Liu Ruming had thirty-nine regiments in the early days of the War of Resistance, but now less than one-sixth of them remain. Brigade Commander Liu then said in a humorous tone: "This time the reorganization, the miscellaneous military officers were all 'promoted'! Mi Wenhe was promoted two levels, from army commander to brigade commander, and I myself was also promoted from division commander to brigade commander. This is the fate of our Northwest Army. Brigade Commander Liu believes that the Eighth Route Army and the Northwest Army are both miscellaneous troops, but the Eighth Route Army fought back against Chiang Kai-shek's unreasonable oppression, while the Northwest Army waited to die, like docile sheep at the mercy of others.
    Brigade Commander Liu was born into a poor peasant family, and in his childhood, his parents were so poor that they had to beg for a living. He expressed his satisfaction with the land reform in the Liberated Areas, which realized Mr. Sun Yat-sen's principle of people's livelihood of "land to the tiller." "I myself am a member of the Kuomintang, but I am very clear that although the Kuomintang holds memorial services there every Monday, reciting the Prime Minister's will like monks chanting scriptures, they have not implemented the Three People's Principles in the past nineteen years. The Kuomintang only talks but does not act, while the Communist Party says and does. Sooner or later, this unreasonable society in China must be reformed."
    He has now read the declarations of Generals Gao Shuxun, Kong Congzhou, and Wei Fenglou, who advocate democracy and peace, unite with the Eighth Route Army, and oppose Chiang Kai-shek's civil war, treason, and dictatorship, and believes that this has opened up a bright road for the miscellaneous troops. "Previously, I was very sorry that there was no Cai E in China today who raised his arms and called for the denunciation of Yuan Shikai. Now I understand that the Communist Party is today's Cai E. It is a great fortune for me to be able to visit the Liberated Areas after this defeat and learn some great principles of national independence, prosperity, and the establishment of a united government."
    When the topic turned to the Battle of Juancheng, Brigade Commander Liu admired the Eighth Route Army's bravery and skill in battle, its flexible command, and its unpredictable tactics. "Before we set off from Heze on the 27th, we received news from the Joint Logistics Command that there was no water in the Juancheng area, and no Eighth Route Army. The Fifth Army and the Eleventh Division also said that they had occupied Hongchuankou, east of Juancheng. I was ordered to attack Juancheng, thinking that with American planes and cannons, and attacking the Eighth Route Army by surprise, we would surely win. Who knew that on the 29th, when I rushed from Heze to Sutun, Gaokuaizhuang, south of Juancheng, our troops started fighting with the Eighth Route Army. The battle lasted for two days and two nights, and was very fierce. The eight American howitzers attached to the Tenth Artillery Regiment of the Central Government did not fight as vigorously as they did when they cooperated with the Fifth Army and the Eleventh Division. When I ordered the gunners to fire, they always made excuses that they couldn't fire this way or that way, especially saying that they couldn't aim at night and couldn't fire. As a result, not only did it not work, but it became my burden. I hoped that American planes would come to help, but Director Liu said that they would come at dawn, and it wasn't until the afternoon that they flew over, circled a few times, and flew away again. Waiting for the Fifth Army, who knew that even in the most critical moment, they were nowhere to be seen." Brigade Commander Liu said angrily: "This time we were completely deceived by Chiang Kai-shek's direct line of troops, and also deceived by American-made planes and cannons, and suffered the complete annihilation of the army. This is also the fate of the miscellaneous troops." Brigade Commander Liu could not help but burst into tears when he talked about this. Finally, he said: "What I am saddened by is not only the complete annihilation of the army, but even more so by the tragic situation of why Chinese people are killing each other today."

    访刘广信旅长
    齐语
    鄄城之战放下武器之蒋军一一九旅刘广信旅长（原师长），已于五日抵达某地。刘伯承将军、李达参谋长及若干同志均曾分别往访。刘旅长身体魁伟健壮，着浅灰色棉军服，光着头。原来他戴着一顶镶着金边的美国式平顶圆形的军官帽子，在来刘伯承将军指挥部的途中摔掉了：第一次摔下，护送的战士给他拾起来；第二次在渡过一条小河沟时，他从马上狠狠摔进深水里去，叫战士再不要拾起那顶“亡国帽子”。现在他有一顶蓝色的新棉军帽。
    一间宽敞的大屋子，阳光正照射着刘旅长红润发光的脸。记者往访时，他正在伏案阅读各种书报，虽然是第一次见面，或者由于他的性格直爽坦率吧？谈话毫无拘束，就像久别重逢的朋友一样，愉快的促膝谈心。刘旅长毫不掩饰的叙述：他刚从战场上放下武器与我军初见的时候，只承认是个少尉副官。后来看到我指战员都很有礼貌，而且生活上招待的很周到，内心很感动，觉得以前外边所传被八路军捉住如何如何，于今才知都是谣言。于是，便说出自己的真实姓名。并表示愿意参观解放区。
    刘旅长现年三十九岁，安徽太和县人。民国十四年他十七岁时，在北平入刘汝明部当兵，二十年来的戎马生活，他由一个士兵，逐级升为师长。整编后，任一一九旅旅长。他曾参加过大革命，对蒋介石历来消灭杂牌政策，表示愤怒。他说冯玉祥先生创造的西北军，是有光荣的革命传统的。不论大革命时代，或八年抗日战争，对国家民族有很大的功劳。但蒋介石对功在国家民族的部队，不是奖赏，而是收买、分化、吞并、改编、摧残和消灭。这次缩编，尤为厉害。也许就是这枝军队曾经爱国抗日的缘故吧？他指出刘汝明在抗战初期，拥有三十九个团，现在剩下的还不到六分之一。刘旅长复以幽默的口吻说：“这次整编，杂牌军官都‘升了级’了，米文和连升两级，由军长升为旅长，我自己也是师长升为旅长。这就是我们西北军的下场。一刘旅长认为八路军与西北军都是杂牌，不过八路军受到蒋介石的无理压迫就斗争，而西北军却是束手待毙，像任人宰割的驯服的绵羊一般。
    刘旅长出身于贫苦农家，幼年父母曾贫苦到做乞丐的地步。他对解放区的土地改革，实现了孙中山先生耕者有其田的民生主义，表示欣慰。“我自己是个国民党员，但十分清楚国民党虽然每礼拜一在那里作纪念周，像和尚念经一样的恭读总理遗嘱，但他们十九年来，并没有实行过三民主义。国民党是光说不作，共产党却是说作就作。目前中国这个不合理的社会，迟早必须改革。”
    他现在读了高树勋、孔从周及魏凤楼等将军主张民主和平，跟八路军联合起来，反对蒋介石内战卖国独裁的宣言，认为这是为杂牌军队开辟了一条光明的大道。“先前我很惋惜，目前中国没有一个振臂一呼首倡声讨袁世凯的蔡锷先生。现在我了解了共产党就是今日之蔡先生。我这次战败，能来解放区参观学习些民族国家独立富强与建立联合政府的大道理，实一大幸事。”
    论题转到鄄城之战，刘旅长佩服八路军勇敢善战，指挥灵活，神机莫测。“我们二十七号在荷泽出发前，曾从联总方面获得消息，说鄄城一带没有水，也没有八路军。第五军及第十一师又说他们已占领了鄄城以东的红船口。我奉命进攻鄄城，以为有了美国的飞机大炮，打八路军又是乘虚而入，一定取胜。谁知二十九日我由荷泽赶到鄄城以南之苏屯，高魁庄时，我们的队伍，就与八路军打起来了。战斗两日两夜，非常激烈。中央炮十团所配属的美国的八门榴弹重炮，也不像配合第五军及十一师作战那样打得起劲。我指挥炮手打炮，他总是借口这样没法打，那样没法打，特别说到夜间瞄不准，更没法打。结果不但没起作用，反成了我的累赘。盼望来美式飞机助战，刘主任说天亮就来，等到下午才飞来晃了几个圈圈又飞走了。等待第五军，谁知道最危急的时候也见不到他们的影子。”刘旅长很气愤的说：“这次我们完全受了蒋介石嫡系军队的骗，也受了美造飞机大炮的骗，遭到了全军的覆灭，这也是杂牌的下场。”刘旅长谈到这里，不禁热泪盈眶。最后说：“我痛心的不只是全军的覆灭，而更是今天中国人与中国人为何竟出现了如此自相残杀的悲惨局面。”
