　　[Our Newspaper Taihang Dispatch, 31st] Several crack armed work teams composed of over 5,000 people from the powerful local corps of the Fourth Military Sub-district of Taihang and mountain militia, under the leadership of General Huang Xinyou, Commander of the Fourth Military Sub-district, advanced into the rear of the invading Chiang troops. They established guerrilla base areas south of the western section of the Daoqing Railway and launched guerrilla warfare, repeatedly achieving victories and dealing a fatal blow to the Chiang troops' attempt to establish a "beachhead" north of the Yellow River. Following the recapture of strongholds such as Xiaogao and Xiaodong west of Wu Zhi at the end of September, the guerrilla corps recaptured Yangyimiao in Bo'ai on the 20th of this month, eliminating over 30 personnel from the stubborn puppet district government and liberating over 300 conscripted men. On the 23rd, a part of the guerrilla corps attacked the stubborn stronghold of Dayou Village in Wu Zhi, engaging in a fierce battle with six companies of the stubborn enemy for one night, killing or wounding over 100, capturing over 30 alive, and seizing over 10 rifles, over 10,000 rounds of ammunition, and some artillery shells. On the same night, our armed work team cleverly attacked the Chiang puppets in Daxing Village, completely routing the Chiang enemy, capturing seven Chiang soldiers alive, and seizing some ammunition. On the 25th, they also recaptured Weicun (northwest of Qinyang) on the north bank of the Qin River, where over 34 of the over 300 men of the puppet Li Deji's troops were killed or wounded, and over 80 were captured. On the 26th, a part of our armed work team ambushed a reconnaissance platoon of Chiang troops from Qinyang to Bo'ai, completely annihilating them, killing seven enemies, wounding the platoon leader and five others, capturing four alive, and seizing one light and heavy machine gun, four rifles, and two head of livestock. By this point, the vast area west of the Da Dan River and north of the Qin River had been completely liberated again. Currently, in the western section of the Daoqing Railway and south of the railway, the Chiang puppet troops are only holding on to a few isolated strongholds, while the vast majority of villages are under the control of the military and civilians of the liberated areas. The decrees of the democratic governments of Xiuwu, Bo'ai, Qinyang, Wenxian, and Wuzhi counties are still unimpeded throughout the entire territory of each county.
