　　[This newspaper's Yangcheng dispatch, 7th] Under the unified leadership of the Jiang County Party, government, military, and civilians, Chiang's troops can only defend the isolated county seat. The entire territory of the county remains intact. After Chiang's troops occupied Jiang County, the Party, government, military, and civilians of the county carried forward the experience of the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan. Each district gathered cadres with combat experience to quickly form powerful guerrilla groups. Each district established a combat company, with the district head serving as the company commander and the district party secretary serving as the political instructor. The district office was transformed into an armed district office, and each county defense village was organized into a combat platoon. The village office was transformed into an armed village office. The remaining cadres formed work teams, combined with the militia, and went deep into the vicinity of Chiang's military strongholds to carry out activities to universally destroy and combat the stubborn regime, restore and establish a democratic regime. In a total of 47 days of combat, they fought 27 times, compressing the activities of Chiang's military regime to within five li of the city. Currently, in the entire territory, except for the isolated stronghold of Jiang County, the district and village regimes in all four districts of the county are still persisting in their work, and government orders flow smoothly throughout the territory.
