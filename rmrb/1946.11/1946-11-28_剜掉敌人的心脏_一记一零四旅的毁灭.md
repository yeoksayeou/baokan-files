　　Gouging Out the Enemy's Heart
　　An Account of the Annihilation of the 104th Brigade
　　Ping Zhu, Yao Wu, Pei Guang
　　After Chiang Kai-shek announced the so-called "ceasefire order" had "taken effect," Chiang's troops, the 41st and 47th Divisions, led by the Chiang bandit Hebei Province Security 12th General Detachment, invaded Sijianfang northeast of Hua County and Liangmen Town directly south of Puyang, continuing their advance toward Puyang. On the night of the 18th, a unit of our Eighth Route Army bypassed Chiang's army outposts such as Baidaokou and Liugu and directly attacked Shangguan Village, the headquarters of the invading army's 41st Division, 104th Brigade, and the 311th Regiment.
　　Shangguan Village is surrounded by water on the southeast and has an endless open space to the north, with Lianghu Village as a shield to the west. The terrain is easy to defend and difficult to attack. After the 104th Brigade arrived, they added 175 bunkers, a moat, and three rows of deer fences to the walls, street corners, and around the village, forming a tight network of fire. In the eyes of Yang Xianming, the commander of the 104th Brigade, it would be difficult even for a mouse to get through. However, starting at midnight, the battle to clear the periphery ended at midnight this time. The next morning, the enemies in Taojia Village to the east of the village and Lianghu Village to the west were also completely annihilated.
　　The front-line commander looked at his watch. It was exactly 6:05 a.m., and he issued the order on the phone: "Begin the general attack!" For a time, the sound of mountain guns, mortars, infantry guns, and light and heavy machine guns shook the entire position. The infantry launched an attack from both the east and west sides at the same time. The × Company first broke through the enemy's forward position in the northeast corner, and another company passed through the moat and deer fences and quickly advanced towards the wall. Under the enemy's tight fire blockade, the assault team soldiers threw grenades and climbed up the wall through the gaps broken by the engineers, using human ladders. Comrade Ren Cheng, the eighth squad leader, snatched the enemy's heavy machine gun and telephone from the bunker. The second detachment of the × Company, which broke into the village, held fast in a tall building, resisting dozens of times the number of enemies. The political commissar set up a simple command post on the wall with a telephone. An hour passed, and the × Company made a second breakthrough on the wall, clearing the enemies in the northeast corner bunkers at 9:30 a.m. The fierce street fighting developed towards the southwest. More than twenty courtyards were captured. The enemies trapped in the tall building in the southwest corner broke through to the south and north twice, but none escaped.
　　At 11:00 a.m., our brave warriors launched the final attack on the tall building in the southwest, where Yang Xianming, the commander of the 104th Brigade, personally commanded the remnants to hold on. The commander chose the breakthrough point. Engineers Sun Decheng, Wang Taihe, and Li Shunzi accepted the task of destroying a high wall in the alley. The enemy blocked the alley with firepower from underground bunkers at both ends, while our machine guns concentrated on dealing with an underground bunker at the southern end. At this time, three engineer warriors, each carrying a medicine bag, crawled under the intertwined machine-gun fire net less than two feet above the ground. When they rushed back, six courtyard walls exploded. Mountain guns destroyed the enemy's fortified tall building at a short distance of 200 meters. Mortar gunner Wang Liquan held the barrel of the cannon in his arms and used an angle of more than 80 degrees to bombard the enemies in the adjacent courtyard. At the same time, grenades from the attacking troops exploded in every courtyard. Li Lizheng, the captain of the Seventh Squad, and Yang Fujun, the hero who killed the enemy, advanced courtyard by courtyard to the top of the last courtyard wall and found more than 300 Chiang's soldiers in the passageway at the courtyard entrance. They immediately threw grenades down with quick eyes and hands. At this time, a Chiang's army officer shouted, "Don't fight anymore, we surrender our guns, we surrender our guns." Li Lizheng immediately replied, "Okay, quickly put down your weapons. We will treat prisoners of war kindly and guarantee your safety..." Before he finished speaking, the Chiang's soldiers put down their weapons and applauded. Li Lizheng and Yang Fujun jumped off the wall and shook hands with the liberated brothers. The Chiang's soldiers who had laid down their weapons said emotionally, "We are all one family, we are all one family." Yang Fujun then rushed into another courtyard. The Chiang's soldiers in the east room were so frightened that they huddled together. Yang Fujun found two officers squatting behind the door in the corner of the wall and under the desk in the crowd. Fujun took down their insignias and saw that they were Yang Xianming, the commander of the 104th Brigade, and Li Keyuan, the deputy brigade commander. He jumped up happily, put the insignias away, and led them to the reception center. According to Tang Haoyun, the adjutant of Brigade Commander Yang Xianming, when the Eighth Route Army began to attack Shangguan Village on the evening of the 18th, Yang was working in the living room of the Yu Tai Xiang pharmacy on East Street. He received a telegram from Chiang Kai-shek saying, "Six brigades of reinforcements will arrive tomorrow morning... If you lose Shangguan Village, I will kill you." In a few minutes, five shells from our army collapsed the office. Brigade Commander Yang fled to several places in a panic, and finally crawled into the headquarters of the 311th Regiment through a small hole to hold on, waiting for Chiang Kai-shek's reinforcements. But until he was taken prisoner, he did not see a single reinforcement. The failure of this campaign was the second masterpiece of Gu Zhutong since he took office, following the Battle of Juancheng.

　　剜掉敌人的心脏
    一记一零四旅的毁灭
    平铸　耀武　裴光
    在蒋介石公布所谓“停战令”“生效”以后，蒋军四十一、四十七师，以蒋贼河北省保安十二总队为前导，侵占我滑县东北的四间房，濮阳正南的两门镇，继续向我濮阳进犯。十八日夜，我八路军某部，插过白道口、留固等蒋军前哨据点，直捣进犯军第四十一师一○四旅旅部及三一一团驻地上官村。
    上官村东南两面临水，村北是一望无际的开阔地，西面以两户村为屏障。地势易守难攻。一○四旅到后，即在围墙上，街头巷尾和村子周围，增筑了一百七十五个碉堡、一道水沟和三道鹿砦。把全村构成一个严密的火力网。这在一○四旅旅长杨显明看来，就是老鼠也难钻过。但这次午夜开始，子夜即结束了扫清外围的攻击战。次日清早，村东陶家村与村西两户村的敌人也全部被歼。
    前线指挥员看看自己的表，正是六点零五分，即在电话上发出命令：“开始总攻”，一时山炮、迫击炮、步兵炮和轻重机枪爆裂声，使整个阵地都震动起来。步兵从东西两面同时发起冲锋，×中队首先突破敌人东北角的前沿阵地，另一中队通过水沟与鹿砦，迅速向围墙突进。突击队的战士们在敌人严密的火力封锁下，打着手榴弹，由工兵突破的缺口搭着人梯，爬上围墙。八班长任成如同志从碉堡里把敌人的重机枪和电话机夺下来，突入村中的×中队二分队，固守在一处高房子里，抗击着数十倍的敌人。政治委员带着电话机，把简单的指挥所设在围墙上。一小时过去了，×中队二次突进围墙，九时半扫清了东北角碉堡的敌人。激烈的巷战向西南方向发展，二十几处院子被夺过来，困守西南角高房子里的敌人，两次向南、北突围，但没有一个侥幸漏网。
    十一时，我们的勇士又向一○四旅旅长杨显明亲自指挥残部固守的西南高房子开始最后的攻击。指挥员选择了突破点，工兵孙德成、王太和、李顺子、接受了摧毁小巷子内一面高墙的任务。敌人从两端的地下堡垒中，用火力封锁住巷口，我们的机枪则集中对付敌人南端的一个暗堡。这时在离地面不及二尺高的交织着的机枪火网下，爬行着三个抱了药包的工兵勇士。当他们飞步回奔的时候，六座院墙爆裂，山炮在二百米的短距离里摧毁了敌人固守的高房，迫击炮射击手王立全手臂抱着炮筒，用八十以上的角度，轰击隔壁院子里的敌人。同时每个院子里都爆炸着攻击部队的手榴弹，七小队队长李立正与杀敌英雄杨富俊逐院进击到最后一座院子的墙头上，发现蒋军三百余人在院门口的夹道中，他们当即眼灵手快地往下投手榴弹，这时一个蒋军军官便高呼：“不打了，我们交枪，我们交枪。”李立正随即回答：“好，快把武器放下，我们优待俘虏，保证你们生命安全……”话未说完，蒋军即放下武器，鼓掌欢迎，李立正、杨富俊跳下墙头，和被解放的弟兄握手，放下武器的蒋军感动的说：“我们都是一家人，我们都是一家人。”杨富俊继即冲入另一院内，东屋内蒋军已吓得缩成一团，杨富俊从人群中发现蹲在门后墙角和办公桌下的两个军官，富俊取下他们符号一看，原来是一○四旅旅长杨显明，和副旅长李克源。他高兴的跳起来，顺手将符号放好，把他们领到招待所。据杨显明旅长勤务兵唐浩云谈，杨氏在八路军十八日晚开始打上官村时，正在东大街豫泰祥药店客厅办公，接到蒋介石的电报说：“援兵六个旅明早即到……，失掉上官村杀你的头。”不几分钟，我军五发炮弹已把办公厅打塌，杨旅长仓惶转移数处，最后由小洞钻入三一一团团部坚守，等待蒋介石的援兵。但直到作了俘虏还不见一个援兵的影。这次战役的失败是顾祝同上任以来继鄄城战役之后的第二个杰作。
