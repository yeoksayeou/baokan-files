　　Cixian Three Thousand Strong Men Enlist
    Nanlai Village Militia Captain Liu Changchun Leads Twenty-Two to Join the Army

    [Our Newspaper] To defend the fruits of emancipation and defeat Chiang Kai-shek's invading army, three thousand strong men from Cixian have signed up for the army. The militia captain, joint defense instructor, and farmers' association chairman of the Third District, when spontaneously enlisting in the army at the mobilization meeting, said: "We have already turned ourselves around, and we don't want anything from the village. We are only fighting to defend the fruits of our struggle and live a good life forever!" Under their influence, more than eighty people also signed up. In the Second District, during an activist meeting, the militia captain of Nanlai Village, Liu Changchun, led twenty-two militiamen to join the army. Following this, the cadres of Gucheng Village also led more than fifty young and strong men, with horns blowing and drums beating, into the meeting place, demanding to sign up on the spot. Under their influence, villages immediately started a competition. In the First District, at a mobilization meeting of more than four hundred activists, forty-three people signed up, and by the evening of the same day, ninety people had completed their registration, exceeding the task by fifty. By the night of the eleventh, they had reached one hundred and ninety people, exceeding the task by three times. In the activist meetings of the Fifth, Ninth, and Fourth Districts, people signed up on the spot. Retired veteran Wang Jialin said: "I am going back to the front line and taking three young people with me. It is better to strike first and fight Chiang Kai-shek to the end." Wang Shengtang, the militia captain of Xingliwencun Village in the First District, said when signing up for the army: "We cannot wait for the enemy at home. We must fight him. I guarantee to lead a squad to fight the enemy on the Longhai Line!" Following this, a family member of a soldier, Wan Liren, took the stage and said: "I have two sons. My second son has already joined the army. Now is the crucial moment. Our strength is equal to the enemy's. My eldest son is about to get married, but he won't get married now. I will mobilize him to join the army, and we will eliminate the enemy before he comes back to get married." Intellectual Huang Zhi said: "Chiang Kai-shek sold the country to the United States, and I will also join the army and fight him." The militia instructor's wife, Ren Aixiang, said: "Poor people have turned themselves around, and my husband and I have also turned ourselves around. Chiang Kai-shek wants to attack us, and I will mobilize my husband to join the army." Her husband hurriedly exclaimed: "I still need you to mobilize me? Even if you don't mobilize me, I will still join the army." In the Second District, Kong Jiufa, the Farmers' Association group leader of Yuquancun Village, mobilized his son Bani to join the army. After several mobilizations, his son's thinking was not clear, and he was so anxious that he couldn't eat or sleep. He called his son to his bedside and persuaded him left and right, reasoning with him and saying nice things, but it didn't work. His father was so angry that he cried and said: "Son! If you really don't go, you will really anger me to death! If you don't go and defeat Old Chiang, we won't have a good life. Just go and suffer a little!" After persuading him like this all night, Bani's thinking cleared up, and the next day he made a pact with five other young men and signed up together. Yang Chengxian, an old man from Shangzhuang Village in the Ninth District, said: "Old poor people have only turned themselves around once in their lives, and if the stubborn ones come, I can't stand their anger. I will let my child join the army!" As a result, his child took six young men and went to join the army. Huo Lixian from Nihe Village is fifty-two years old, and he signed up to join the army with his son. Others said: "You are old, just let your son go." He replied: "No, my body is still strong. Father and son are soldiers together, and we must defeat Old Chiang."

    南来村民兵队长刘长春带二十二人参军
    【本报讯】为保卫翻身果实，打垮蒋介石进犯军，磁县三千健儿已报名参军。三区民兵队长、联防指导员、农会主席在参军动员大会上当场自动报名参军时说：“我们已翻了身，什么东西也不向村上要，我们光为保卫斗争果实，永远过好时光！”在他们影响下，有八十余人也报了名。二区正在开积极分子会，即有南来村民兵队长刘长春带领二十二个民兵参军。接着固城村干部也带领五十余青壮年吹着号，锣鼓喧天涌入会场，当场要求报名入伍。各村在他们影响下，立即掀起竞赛。一区在四百余积极分子动员会上，报名的四十三人，当天晚即完成九十名，超过任务五十人。十一日夜即达到一百九十人，超过任务三倍。五区、九区、四区在积极分子会上均有人当场报名。荣退军人王加林说：“我重新上前线，并带三个青年去，先下手为强，要和蒋介石干到底。”一区兴里文村民兵队长王省堂同志报名参军时说：“我们不能在家等着敌人，要和他拚，我保证带一个班，到陇海线上打敌人！”接着有军属万立仁登台说：“我有两个儿子，二子已参军了，现在是牛顶头时候，咱们力量和敌人一样，我大儿快娶媳妇了，现在不娶了，我动员他参军，把敌人消灭了回来再娶。”知识分子黄志说：“蒋介石把国卖给美国，我也要参军和他干。”民兵指导员老婆任爱香说：“穷人翻了身，俺夫妇也翻了身，蒋介石要进攻咱，我动员我男人参军。”急的他男人大声疾呼的说：“我还要你动员，你不动员我，我也要去参军。”二区玉泉村农会组长孔九法动员他儿巴妮去参军，经几次动员，思想不通，急的连饭吃不下，觉也睡不着，他把他儿叫到床前左劝右劝，讲道理，说好话，总是不行，气得他父亲连哭带说：“儿呀！真要不去，真要把我气死哩！你不去把老蒋打倒，咱时光过不好，你被点屈去吧！”这样劝了一夜，巴妮思想打通了，第二天约伙了五个青年一同报了名。九区上庄村杨成先老汉说：“老穷人一辈子才翻了身，顽固要来，我可不受他的气，让我孩子去参军！”结果，他孩子带六个青年入伍去了。泥河村霍里现五十二岁了，他同他儿一同报名参军。别人说：“你老了，让你孩子去就行。”他回答：“不行，我身体还强健啦，打仗还是父子兵，非把老蒋打垮不行。”
