　　Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 5th. The militia and New Fourth Army guerrilla local corps in northern Jiangsu and northern Huaihe have launched extensive guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines. The famous Huaiyin Huang Yu guerrilla team, on the evening of the 21st of last month, without firing a single shot, harvested more than ten miles of newly erected power lines by Chiang's army east of Langmu Bridge on the Huaiyin-Siyang Highway. On the 26th, a company of Chiang's troops stationed at Wulizhuang on the Huaiyin-Shuyang Highway, together with more than 200 members of the "Homecoming Corps," carrying five machine guns and two small cannons, advanced north and were killed and captured more than 100 people by the local militia and a part of the New Fourth Army local corps. In the first half of last month, the militia in Yuanji District of Huaiyin, Tanghu District of Suqian, and the northern part of Suqian County successively destroyed Chiang's township offices in Huaiyin's Bajizhen, Suqian's Jiadian, and Qiuweihu, killing and capturing more than 150 Chiang's district instructors, township chiefs, and "Homecoming Corps" members, and seizing more than 40 guns. In Suqian's Lailong District, hundreds of peasants who had turned over organized armed turn-over teams to prevent Chiang's army's "Ten Exhausting Policies." When two battalions of Chiang's troops invading Bao'an Township in Suqian were annihilated by the New Fourth Army on October 6, Xu Xiufa and other nine militiamen from Taishan District shouted and captured nine machine guns from Chiang's army. Militia member Sun Laizhi pointed a gun at the thorns and said, "If you don't come out, I'll shoot you." A Chiang soldier immediately crawled out and brought a light machine gun and a Czech-style rifle to him. Two Chiang soldiers who fled to Zhangzhuang were captured and disarmed by women. The New Fourth Army local armed forces in Sixian County successively repelled the harassment of more than 2,000 Chiang's troops several times in the second half of last month, killing, wounding, and capturing nearly 200 people. When the 60th Brigade of the 69th Division and parts of the 7th Division of Chiang's army, a total of more than 300 people, attacked from Chuan Chengji (about sixty or seventy miles northeast of Sixian County) on the 19th, they were resisted by a part of the New Fourth Army and the local militia. Chiang's army also used an airplane to assist in the battle, attempting to forcibly cross the Sui River, but failed after several fierce attacks, and Chiang's army suffered more than 50 casualties.
