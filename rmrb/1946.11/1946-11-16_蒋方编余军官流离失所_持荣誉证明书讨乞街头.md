Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 13th. According to recent reports in the Tianjin Yi Shi Bao: the majority of disbanded officers sacrificed under Chiang Kai-shek's special agent policies are wandering in various places, unable to make a living, in extremely miserable conditions, and are now forced to take collective action one after another. A Tianjin citizen personally witnessed a disbanded officer, impoverished and ill, collapsing on the street from hunger, dressed in rags and as thin as a rake, a sight that tugged at the heartstrings. Another disbanded officer in Kuomintang military uniform, wearing a medal of honor and holding a certificate of honor, was seen begging along the street with a cane. Huang Zhenliang, a Jiangxi officer from Hengshan, Hunan, who served as a company and battalion commander during the War of Resistance, committed suicide in the Xiang River in September due to poverty in his family after being demobilized. There are more than a thousand unemployed soldiers near Hengshan who have repeatedly requested relief from the authorities, but have been refused. They have appointed representatives to petition the provincial authorities in Changsha. If relief is still not provided, the entire group will go to Changsha and Nanjing to petition. More than two hundred unemployed officers in Guizhou have launched a petition group to demand relief from the authorities.

    蒋方编余军官流离失所
    持荣誉证明书讨乞街头
    【新华社延安十三日电】据最近天津益世报透露：被牺牲在蒋介石特工政策下之大部编余军官，流落各地，无以为生，状极凄惨，现皆被迫相继采取集体行动。天津一市民亲见一编余军官，贫病交迫，饿倒街头，衣衫褴褛，骨瘦如柴，视之使人酸鼻。又见一着蒋军制服的编余军官，胸佩荣誉徽章，手执荣誉证明书，扶拐杖沿街行乞。湖南衡山一江西军官黄振良，抗战中曾任连营长，被遣后，因家庭生活贫困，遂于九月间投身于湘江自杀。衡山附近有失业军人千余人，屡向当局请求救济，皆遭拒绝，已推定代表赴长沙省当局请愿，如再不救济，全体将赴长沙南京请愿。贵州失业军官二百余人，发起请愿团，向当局要求救济。
