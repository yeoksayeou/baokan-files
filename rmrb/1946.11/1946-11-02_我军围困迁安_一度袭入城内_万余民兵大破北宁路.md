　　Xinhua News Agency, Hebei-East Front, 30th. (1) The isolated city of Qian'an, occupied by Chiang's troops, is currently under tight siege by local soldiers and civilians. On the morning of the 15th, a certain unit of the Eighth Route Army, with the assistance of the militia, cleared out all the pillboxes in the suburbs, capturing 90 Chiang soldiers and members of the puppet "General Assembly," along with their weapons. The next day, they once again launched a swift assault into the city, destroying three turret fortifications at the South Gate and completely controlling nearby positions. The militia of the first and second districts of Qian'an have recently annihilated 66 Chiang soldiers under the city and are currently assisting the Eighth Route Army in attacking the city. (2) A certain newly formed guerrilla unit active along the Pinggu line has recently annihilated over 80 Chiang soldiers and officers, taking advantage of opportunities to capture three strongholds, including Menggezhuang, within Miyun, and equipping and strengthening themselves in battle. (3) In the battle to recover Cuihuangkou in Wuqing, the Hebei-East Eighth Route Army completely routed over 400 Chiang soldiers and officers, killing 80, capturing 151 officers and soldiers, including battalion commander Wang Fengshan, and seizing one mortar, three light machine guns, four grenade launchers, and 202 rifles and pistols.
　　
　　Xinhua News Agency, Hebei-East Front, 30th. In mid-month, the Beining Railway of the Chiang Kai-shek's internal war reactionaries was again severely damaged by over ten thousand militia, with over ten miles of the Beining Railway's roadbed completely destroyed. From October 13th to 23rd, the railway was completely shut down for ten days, and a military train (eight cars) was derailed by an explosion. The militia have repeatedly demonstrated the effectiveness of landmines made from confiscated rails on the railway line. On the 15th, over 40 Chiang soldiers from Anshan (west of Changli) set out to inspect the line, and when they moved a rail beside the road, five of them were killed by a landmine planted by the militia, and the rest retreated in panic.
