Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 29th—On the second day (the 22nd) of the "American Troops Out of China Movement Week" in the Taiyue District, Huang Zhengcheng, Lieutenant General and Brigade Commander of the First Brigade of the Chiang Army, and Dai Tao, Chief of Staff, who laid down their weapons in the Fushan Campaign, spoke to our agency's reporter. Huang said: "I sincerely hope for peace, and that the civil war will stop quickly, but this depends on the United States stopping its policy of aiding Chiang in the civil war. American troops should withdraw from China." Dai said: "Chiang Kai-shek should not use force to solve China's problems. Force can never restore peace in China. American policy should enable China to quickly achieve peace, not something else. Now, in the Kuomintang army, middle and lower-ranking officers feel deeply pained by the civil war. If Chiang Kai-shek is obsessed and does not wake up, he will suffer greatly." General Dai finally said that the vast number of officers and soldiers of the Chiang army on the front lines of the civil war miss their wives left behind day and night, and urgently demand that American troops withdraw from China in order to stop the internecine civil war.

　　前线蒋军殷念妻子渴望和平
    迫切要求美军撤退
    黄正成戴涛两将军谈话
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫二十九日电】太岳区“美军退出中国运动周”之第二日（二十二日），浮山战役放下武器之蒋军第一旅中将旅长黄正成及参谋长戴涛对本社记者发表谈话。黄说：“我衷心的希望和平，内战赶快停止，但这决定于美国停止援蒋内战政策，美军应该撤离中国。”戴说：“蒋介石不应以武力解决中国问题，武力决不能恢复中国和平。美国政策应当使中国迅速实行和平，而非其他。现在国民党军队中，中下级军官对内战深感痛苦。如蒋介石执迷不悟，会吃大亏的。”戴将军最后表示内战前线蒋军广大官兵们日夜殷念着抛在后方的妻子，迫切要求美军退出中国，以便停止自相残杀的内战。
