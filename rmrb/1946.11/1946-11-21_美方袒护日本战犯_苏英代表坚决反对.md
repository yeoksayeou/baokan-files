　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th. Tokyo dispatch: The American representative to the Allied Council for Japan has been opposed by representatives from the Soviet Union and other countries for shielding Japanese war criminals. At a meeting of the council on the 13th, Soviet representative Derevyanko was the first to speak, denouncing the Japanese government for violating the Allied decision of January 4 regarding purge procedures, allowing many Diet members involved in launching the war of aggression to hold public office. The Soviet representative pointed out seventeen of the most important of these, detailing their backgrounds and explaining that most of them were leaders or advisors of the former Japanese fascist organizations, the Imperial Rule Assistance Association and the Imperial Rule Assistance Political Society, and advocated that they should be purged. He also said that if a more careful re-examination were conducted, many more people who should be purged could be discovered. Derevyanko insisted that if these fascists were allowed to continue to operate in the Diet, there would be no democracy in Japan. American representative Atcheson opposed the purge and re-examination of Japanese Diet members, defending them with the instructions of the Allied Headquarters. The Soviet representative immediately refuted Atcheson by reciting the Allied Headquarters' purge order, which stated that important members and leaders of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association and the Imperial Rule Assistance Political Society should be subject to the purge. Atcheson was immediately left speechless. The British representative also spoke out against the U.S. side's act of shielding Japanese criminals.

　　美方袒护日本战犯
    苏英代表坚决反对
    【新华社延安十五日电】东京讯：对日委员会美代表因袒护日战犯而遭受苏联等国代表的反对。委员会于十三日开会时，苏代表德勒维扬哥首起发言，指斥日本政府违背一月四日盟军决定的清洗手续，予许多与发动侵略战争有关的议员担任公职。苏代表指出其中最主要的十七人，详细介绍其履历，说明这些人多数为前日法西斯组织大政翼赞会与翼赞政治会的首领或顾问，主张应加以清洗。并称：倘若重新谨慎审查一下，尚可发现许多应受清洗之人。德勒维扬哥坚称：倘允这些法西斯分子继续在国会活动，则日本将无民主可言。美代表艾其森反对清洗与重新审查日本国会议员，他以盟军总部之指令为他们辩护。苏代表当即诵读盟军总部的清洗令以驳斥艾其森。该令载称：大政翼赞会与翼赞政治会重要分子与领导人物应在清洗之列。艾其森立即无言以答。英代表发言时对美方袒护日罪犯的行为，亦表示反对。
