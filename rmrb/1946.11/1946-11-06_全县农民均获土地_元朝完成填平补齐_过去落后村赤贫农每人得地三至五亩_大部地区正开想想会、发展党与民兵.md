[This report from our Jinnan Weixian correspondent on the 3rd] The Yuanzhao peasant emancipation movement has been victoriously completed. Leveling and replenishment has been carried out in over 300 villages in the county. Ninety percent of the peasants are organized. Two hundred and forty landlord and rich peasant households have compensated the masses for the loss of over 4,000 mu of land. All peasants in the county have obtained land. For example, in the Wang, Gui, and Liu villages in the First District, the work was previously the most backward, but this time the investigation and reduction were also carried out very thoroughly. All the impoverished peasants in Guizhuang were promoted to middle peasants, each being replenished with three mu of land. The poor and lower-middle peasants in Wangzhuang were also promoted to middle peasants, each being replenished with five mu of land. During the movement, over 90% of the peasants were absorbed to participate in the struggle, and all were organized into labor, peasant, women, and militia organizations. In Qiqu Huazhuang, all 750 people in the village participated in the struggle, and the number of organized peasants was sufficient to reach 700. In Liuqu Dishang Village, 23 honest peasants were developed into members overnight. The masses participating in the organization account for an absolute advantage in more than 200 villages throughout the county, and they have taken the position of masters. In the movement, they also grasped the policy particularly steadily. No middle peasant household's interests were damaged in the entire county. On the contrary, the middle peasants were all active members participating in the struggle. Qiqu made clear regulations on issues such as struggle, land donation, and voluntary land. In small, poor villages like Wanggui Village in Liuqu, some middle peasants voluntarily proposed not to share the fruits of the struggle, but to allow the poor peasants to share more. The landlords who were liquidated and who donated land voluntarily also showed stability and actively participated in labor and production. At present, the development of the movement has ended the chaotic situation and is turning to reorganization and distribution of fruits. Villages where the land problem has been completely resolved have entered production after discussions in the sub-districts. Villages with fewer problems have solved the land problem, and now half of the villages have distributed all the fruits. In the First District, because there were improper aspects in the distribution of fruits in the past, it is now emphasized that a thorough inspection should be carried out to see if the fruits have been distributed to the poor masses, and it is proposed to educate village cadres and militiamen to strengthen the mass concept, and to frankly admit to the masses the errors in the previous distribution of fruits and to properly compensate the masses. In other areas, election of mass movement models, appraisal of members, holding of "think-think meetings" to raise awareness, development of the Party, development of militia, and transition to production are underway.
[This report from our Weixian correspondent on the 2nd] On October 13, after Renxian convened a mass mobilization meeting of over 900 county, district, and village cadres, the leveling and replenishment movement was launched. By the 18th, more than 50 villages had been swept into the movement, accounting for one-third of the villages in the county. Many villages have organized 80% or 90% of the masses. At present, villages throughout the county where the masses have been initially mobilized are carrying out internal democratic movements to unite the middle peasants and strengthen their forces. Blank villages that have not been mobilized are being connected and brewed. The following experiences have been gained in the movement: 1. Villages with few struggle targets can struggle against one household, liquidate one household, and then struggle again; if there are many struggle targets, one household can be overthrown, then the second and third households can be struggled against, and then handled according to the size of the crime, so that it can be done quickly and neatly; 2. After detaining traitorous landlords, their belongings should be confiscated immediately to prevent their families from dispersing and hiding them; and letting the masses see the belongings with their own eyes will boost morale; 3. When struggling and dealing with landlords and local bullies, there should be no intermediaries to mediate, and what the masses say is what it is, and it should be resolutely implemented, so as to avoid landlords and local bullies bargaining, increasing troubles, and affecting the progress of the movement.

　　全县农民均获土地
    元朝完成填平补齐
    过去落后村赤贫农每人得地三至五亩
    大部地区正开想想会、发展党与民兵
    【本报冀南威县三日电】元朝农民翻身运动胜利完成，全县三百余村填平补齐，百分之九十农民组织起来，二百四十户地主富农赔偿群众损失四千多亩土地，全县农民都获得了土地。如一区王、桂、刘三村，过去工作最落后，这次查减中也作的非常彻底。桂庄赤贫农全部升为中农，每人填平三亩地，王庄贫农、贫中农，也都升为中农，每人填平五亩地。运动中并吸收了百分之九十以上的农民参加斗争，全部组织到工农妇及民兵等组织中去。七区化庄全村七百五十人参加斗争，组织起来的农民就够七百。六区堤上村一夜发展老实农民二十三人入会。参加组织的群众，在全县二百多村内都占了绝对优势，走上了主人翁的地位。在运动中他们掌握政策也特别稳当，全县未损害一户中农利益，相反的，中农都是积极参加斗争的会员。七区关于斗争、献田、自动地等问题，都作了明确规定。六区王桂村这样的小穷村内，中农有的自动提出不分斗争果实，多叫贫苦农民分。被清算及献田自动地的地主，也表现了稳定，都积极参加劳动，下地生产。目前运动的发展，大乱局面终结，转向整理组织，分配果实。土地问题已彻底解决的村庄，经小区讨论，都转入生产。问题少的村解决了土地问题，现在已有二分之一的村庄把果实全部分完。一区因过去分配果实有不妥之处，目下强调提出深入检查，果实是否分到贫苦群众之手，并提出教育村干民兵，加强群众观念，以往果实分配中的错误，要向群众坦白，适当补还群众。其他各地，正进行选举群运模范，鉴定会员，开“想想会”提高觉悟，发展党，发展民兵，转生产等等工作。
    【本报威县二日电】十月十三日，任县召集县区村九百余干部举行群众翻身动员大会后，即展开填平补齐运动，至十八日已有五十余村卷入运动，占全县村庄三分之一，很多村庄已组织群众百分之八十或九十。现全县群众已初步发动的村庄，正在开展内部民主运动，团结中农，壮大力量。没有发动过的空白村正在串连，酝酿中。在运动中得出如下经验：一、斗争对象少的村庄可以斗一户、清理一户，然后再斗；如斗争对象多，可以斗倒一户，即斗第二户、第三户，然后根据罪恶大小处理，这样可以迅速干脆；二、把汉奸地主扣住后，要立即没收其东西，以防他家疏散稳藏；并让群众亲眼看到东西，情绪会更高涨；三、斗争与处理地主恶霸时，不要有中人调解，群众说一是一，坚决执行，以免地主恶霸讨价还价，增加麻烦，影响运动的进行。
