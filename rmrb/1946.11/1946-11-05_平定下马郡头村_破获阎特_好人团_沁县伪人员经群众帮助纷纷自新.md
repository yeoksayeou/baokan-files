　　[Reported by this newspaper from Changzhi on the 26th] Xiama County's Tou Village, on the 17th of last month, cracked the Yan Special Agent assassination organization "Good People Group." The leading figures, Zhao Dianzhi, Liu Yingtao, Liu Yingaao, and others have all been arrested. The "Good People Group" is an external organization of the Yan Special Agent "Progressive Society," specializing in accommodating reactionary feudal forces and remnants of traitors in our area, engaging in assassinations of our district cadres, and sabotaging mass movements. The Zhao traitors and others were local despotic landlords who, during the period of occupation, acted as heads of "Yiguandao" under the direction of Japanese special agencies, developing towards our Xiyang and Heshun, and secretly deploying special agent lines. Liu Yingtao was arrested by our government for this reason in the 32nd year of the Republic of China (1943) and released after education under our lenient policy. Zhao traitors and others also confessed their guilt to the government, but their evil intentions did not die out, and they carried out secret activities. In August of last year, when Japan surrendered, Zhao and others sent people to Pingding City in September to make contact with the Yan Special Agent "Progressive Society" and were ordered to organize the "Good People Group," with Zhao as the head, Liu Yingtao as the deputy head, and Liu Yingaao as the secretary. Political, intelligence, and supervisory committees were set up, and from then on, they carried out activities in the village, attempting to undermine mass movements, seize power, and plan to assassinate cadres. The death of Zhao Meixiao, the militia instructor of the village, in November of last year, was caused by poisoning by the Zhao traitor. The poisoning of Wang Yiting, chairman of the County Salvation Association, in June of this year, was also done by the Liu traitor Yingtao. They also repeatedly reported to the Yan puppet regime on the situation of our government agencies and the location of the army. Recently, they have been spreading rumors and poisoning on a large scale. The masses in the village are extremely resentful and have launched an anti-special agent struggle. The conspiracy of the Zhao traitors and others has been completely exposed. The democratic government is currently interrogating the traitor, and a small number of duped elements are also confessing.

    [Reported by this newspaper from Yangcheng] In Qin County, personnel who had previously participated in the puppet army have repented and renewed themselves with the help of the masses. At the beginning of the mass movement, the Chiang special agents spread rumors, saying, "The Eighth Route Army doesn't stand on ceremony. Anyone who has worked for the Japanese will be killed." Therefore, many puppet army personnel and their families hid in fear of punishment and dared not participate in the movement. But the facts shattered the rumors of the Chiang special agents. During the movement, they saw that those who were struggled against were all heinous and die-hard major traitors. They also saw that the poor puppet army families were also given fruits and received relief, so they gradually dispelled their ideological concerns. The son of Huang Lai of Yuanwang Village, after being captured by the enemy and forced to join the puppet army, had robbed nearby villages. The robbed masses helped him wash his face, he confessed his mistakes, and determined to renew himself, which won the understanding of the masses. His father was very grateful and gave six sheep to the masses. Since then, the fleeing puppet army personnel have returned to their hometowns one after another. Now dozens of people have confessed to the masses and sworn to follow the masses forever.

　　平定下马郡头村
    破获阎特“好人团”
    沁县伪人员经群众帮助纷纷自新
    【本报长治二十六日讯】平定下马郡头村，于上月十七日破获阎特暗杀组织“好人团”，首要分子赵殿治，刘映桃，刘映鳌等均已落网。“好人团”为阎特“进步社”之外围组织，专在我区收容反动封建势力与汉奸余孽，从事暗杀我区干部，并破坏群众运动。赵逆等为当地恶霸地主，沦陷时期即在日特机关指使下充任“一贯道”会首，向我昔阳、和顺发展，秘密布置特务线。刘映桃曾因此于民国三十二年为我政府逮捕，在我宽大政策下教育释放，赵逆等亦曾向政府自首悔过，但仍祸心不死，秘密活动。去年八月日本投降，九月赵等即派人入平定城与阎特“进步社”接头，受命组织“好人团”，由赵任团长，刘映桃任副团长，刘映鳌任秘书，下设政治、情报、监察等委员，自此即在该村大肆活动，企图破坏群运，掌握政权，并计划暗杀干部，去年十一月该村民兵指导员赵美小之死，即为赵逆下毒所杀。今年六月县救联会主席王仪廷中毒，亦为刘逆映桃所为。彼等并曾数度向阎伪报告我政府机关情况与军队驻地。最近更大肆造谣，普遍投毒，该村群众愤恨已极，掀起反特斗争，赵逆等阴谋完全暴露，现民主政府对该逆正审讯中，少数上当分子亦在自首坦白中。（冯庭槐）
    【本报阳城讯】沁县以前参加过伪军的人员，在群众帮助下，纷纷悔过自新。群运开始时，蒋特造谣说：“八路军不讲客气，凡是给日本办过事的人一律都杀”，因此很多伪军人员及其家属畏罪躲藏，不敢参加运动。但事实粉碎了蒋特的造谣，在运动中他们见到被斗争的没一个不是罪恶滔天、死心塌地的大汉奸，更见到贫苦的伪军家属还分得果实得到救济，遂逐渐解除了思想顾虑。元王村黄来之子，被敌人抓去当伪军后，曾在附近村庄抢劫，被抢的群众找他帮他洗脸，他坦白了自己的错误，决心自新，取得了群众谅解，他父亲非常感激，牵出六只羊给群众。自此以后，逃亡的伪军人员即陆续返乡，现已有数十人向群众悔过，并宣誓永远跟着群众走。
