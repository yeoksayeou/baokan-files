Stand on the Side of the People
The Path of Captured Chiang Soldiers
Cheng Yejing

As Chiang Kai-shek wages civil war, the military and civilians of the liberated areas are bravely resisting. In the past three months, the People's Liberation Army has captured 100,000 Chiang soldiers. This is a significant number, accounting for one-third of the 300,000 losses suffered by the Chiang army in the past three months, and 5% of its regular army投入 engaged in the civil war. Among these captured officers and soldiers, according to available materials, there are 17 high-ranking commanders at the rank of general or above. They are: Zhao Xitian, Huang Zhengcheng, Liang Zhenlin, Song Zhixi, Xi Shengkai, Tian Yuncong, Jin Ya'an, Liu Guangguo, Mai Xia, Liu Lishen, Liang Fengde, Hu Kun, Wang Laiyun, Wang Jixiang, Liu Boyan, Wu Zaiying, and Wu Deming. They are either division commanders, deputy brigade commanders, or brigade-level chiefs of staff, all direct executors of Chiang Kai-shek's civil war, but they have all bowed before the justice of the People's Liberation Army. Xi Shengkai, who laid down his arms in the Yugou campaign in Suwan, described his feelings on the front line: "During the Yugou campaign, as soon as I heard the sound of civil war gunfire, my mood dropped to freezing point. Chief of Staff Liu asked me what to do. I advocated staying in position. When order was disrupted, the guards asked me how to handle it, and I immediately ordered them to lay down their arms." As Chiang Kai-shek's unjust war continues, the number of those who automatically or reluctantly bow to the People's Liberation Army will increase. As a private said at the Suzhong anti-civil war grievance meeting: "We do not want to fight a civil war. The officers deceived us, saying that the New Fourth Army were bandits who would bury us alive and skin us if we were caught. But we have been eating well, dressing well, and receiving medical treatment here for more than ten days. If we had known this earlier, we would have come over long ago."

Rescuing the Wounded

Captured Chiang officers and soldiers are vying to prove these experiences. In the Xipo campaign in central Shandong, a Chiang army 73rd Corps machine gun platoon leader was buried when a blockhouse collapsed. After being rescued by Eighth Route Army soldiers, the political instructor explained the domestic situation to him, the medic bandaged his wounds, and the soldiers gave him water and cigarettes. This kind of cordial care finally moved this biased and stubborn platoon leader. He pointed to the gun wound bandaged by the medic and said, "This is a gun wound inflicted by the company commander because I did not resist resolutely. I never thought that it would be bandaged by Eighth Route Army comrades." He then felt ashamed and remorseful, hugged his head and cried bitterly: "We have been betrayed by Chiang Kai-shek. It was a mistake to regard the Eighth Route Army as the enemy. It's really wrong." In the Beilingshan battle in Jimo, Shandong, Chiang army 54th Corps platoon leader Shi Yuxuan witnessed Eighth Route Army soldiers braving artillery fire to rescue the wounded abandoned by the Chiang army and said with emotion: "The Eighth Route Army treats enemy prisoners with utmost benevolence and righteousness." In the Julebao battle in northern Jin, Wu Sheng, a clerk from Ma Zhanshan's army who had never been on the front line, was wounded and captured. After being rescued by the Eighth Route Army and sent to a rear field hospital for treatment, he said after recovering from his injuries: "If I hadn't met the Eighth Route Army, I would have been dragged into the wilderness like a dead dog. I would rather die than be Ma Zhanshan's soldier again." In the battle in southern Jin, more than 300 wounded soldiers below the company commander level from the 91st and 92nd regiments of the 31st Division, who were abandoned by the Chiang army, were all rescued and treated by the Eighth Route Army. The soldiers were told about this and called upon to cooperate with the Eighth Route Army. After the captured Chiang officers and soldiers in the Zouping campaign arrived at our army's rear, they took baths, had haircuts, and changed clothes, embellishing their dirty and unclean faces so that they looked bright and clear. Chen Lequan, the company commander of the 73rd Corps, did not know how to describe it: "The Eighth Route Army, from top to bottom, treats me so well that even my own parents could not take care of me so thoughtfully."

Treated Equally

Hu Shusheng, the company commander of the 172nd Brigade of the Guangxi Army, which did not come from Chiang Kai-shek's direct lineage, said: "Our Guangxi army is getting smaller and smaller, while Chiang Kai-shek's direct lineage troops are getting bigger and bigger, and their equipment is also better. I have been a company commander for five or six years, and I am really tired of it, and I don't know if I can keep it up. I think it is not worth dying for Chiang Kai-shek's civil war. I also heard that the New Fourth Army is very good, so as soon as the gun sounded, we came over. Now that I have lived here for a few days, I am even more convinced that the New Fourth Army's reputation is well-deserved." Luo Xinxi, the deputy battalion commander of the New 7th Brigade who came over from the Subei campaign, said: "The factions in our brigade are complex. There are 'fake Central Army', 'real Central Army', and Sichuan Army. The 'local thugs' from Sichuan and the graduates of the Kuomintang Army University 'fight endlessly', and the 'real Central' and 'fake Central' are also entangled, but the 'local thugs' are the most unpopular because they are not from the direct lineage." Zhang Yisheng, a major propaganda officer of the Chiang army 65th Corps, said: "Chiang Kai-shek transferred the 65th Corps from Guangdong to the civil war as cannon fodder, just to eliminate dissidents. We should resolutely defend the honor of the War of Resistance Against Japan and oppose the civil war."

These so-called "miscellaneous" officers and soldiers, who have always been discriminated against and suffered unfair treatment, now clearly see Chiang Kai-shek's sinister intention to eliminate dissidents and kill people with a borrowed knife. They are all sincerely grateful for the warm welcome, courteous greetings, and equal treatment from the military and civilians in the liberated areas.

The Liberated Area is Our Home

Some Chiang prisoners wanted to retire and go home, and the Eighth Route Army, in accordance with the policy of preferential treatment for prisoners, sent them back to their hometowns, providing travel expenses, gifts, and farewell parties. In August and September, the Shandong Military Region sent back 1,193 people and issued more than 4 million yuan in travel expenses. When 149 Chiang prisoners were sent back in the Tai (Xing) Ru (Gao) campaign in central China, in addition to travel expenses, they were also given socks, towels, and other daily necessities. Wang Xingguo, the company commander of the 55th Division on the Longhai Front, and others all wept and thanked them, saying: "The Communist Party is like a parent reborn."

These Chiang prisoners who left happily had to pass through the gate of hell in Chiang Kai-shek's area. Zhang Yunli, a messenger of the 314th Regiment of the 49th Division of the Chiang army, and 17 others, who were wounded and captured in the Libao battle in Hai'an in early August, were sent back by the New Fourth Army according to their wishes, but when they arrived at their original unit, 12 of them were shot dead by the Chiang side. It turned out that the Chiang army officials were afraid that these prisoners would come back and expose their deception, so they took such vicious measures. Zhang and others managed to escape and returned to the liberated area, and the New Fourth Army immediately sent them to the hospital for recuperation. They were all moved and said: "The liberated area is our home."

Turn the Guns Around and Oppose Chiang Kai-shek and the United States.

The Chiang army officers and soldiers thrown into the civil war pit by Chiang Kai-shek gradually realized that Chiang Kai-shek and American imperialism were their enemies. Tian Congyun, the deputy brigade commander of the New 7th Brigade who went on strike in the Libao battle in central China, said: "The nature of American imperialism's assistance to Chiang Kai-shek in fighting the civil war is the same as Japan's assistance to Wang Jingwei." Many Chiang army prisoners were ashamed to wear "traitor hats" (the Chiang army soldiers' term for American-style military caps). As soon as the Hu Zongnan American-equipped army captured on the Tongpu Front saw the Eighth Route Army soldiers, they immediately abandoned their "traitor hats" and asked to exchange their American military uniforms for Eighth Route Army uniforms. More than 200 officers and soldiers of the 1st Regiment of the Temporary 15th Division of the Chiang 96th Corps, who were captured in the Wenzu campaign in Shandong, realized that they had taken the wrong path and voluntarily asked to join the people's army. At the Lubei New Comrades Welcome Meeting on October 1, Li Binglu of the 2nd Company of the regiment said: "Today I want to avenge the reactionary warlords who oppressed us and resolutely stand on the side of the people." The representative of the 1st Company said: "I am not going home, I want to join the Eighth Route Army. Only by overthrowing the reactionaries can we have a country and a home." In the evening, they also performed their own play "Walking on the Bright Road." Currently, on various battle lines in the liberated areas, batches of awakened Chiang army officers and soldiers are taking up arms and fighting bravely against Chiang Kai-shek. Yang Shunsheng, a gunner of a machine gun and artillery company in the Chiang army captured in the Tai (Xing) Ru (Gao) campaign, personally requested to shell the Chiang army blockhouse, and six out of eight shells hit the target. Ge Jin, the captain of the Chiang army security team who laid down his arms in the Longhai campaign, held a frontline shouting, causing the Chiang army officers and soldiers in the blockhouse to lay down their arms, and the Yejigang Station was restored. Liu Xiaotang, who was liberated in the Taixing campaign, killed more than ten times as many enemies as himself in the Fenjie battle, captured a large cannon, and won over 12 Chiang army soldiers with political shouting. The Central China Field Army immediately awarded him the glorious title of combat model.

Standing on the side of the people and being with the military and civilians in the liberated areas, taking up arms to smash Chiang Kai-shek's offensive is the only path for captured Chiang army officers and soldiers.

　　站到人民方面来
    被俘蒋军的道路
    成也兢
    在蒋介石进行内战，解放区军民奋勇抵抗，三个月来人民解放军已俘掳了蒋官兵十万人，这是一个不小的数目，它占蒋军三个月来损失三十万人的三分之一，占其投入内战正规陆军总数的百分之五。这些被俘的官兵中，据手头现有材料，将级以上的高级指挥官就有十七名，这就是：赵锡田、黄正成、梁镇林、宋志席、洗盛楷、田云从、金亚安、刘光国、麦霞、刘立身、梁凤德、胡昆、王来云、王继祥、刘伯言、吴在瀛、伍德明等，他们或为师长或为正副旅长，或为旅级参谋长，都是蒋介石内战的直接执行者，但都在人民解放军的正义面前低头了。苏皖渔沟战役中放下武器的洗盛楷曾这样形容他在前线的心情说：“此次渔沟战役中，听到内战枪声一响，我心绪即降到冰点。刘参谋长问我进退如何？我即主张留在阵地。当秩序紊乱时，卫士问我如何处理，我即下令放下武器”。蒋介石不义战争的继续，自动的被迫的向人民解放军低头的数字更将扩增，正如苏中反内战诉苦大会上一个上等兵所说：“我们是不愿打内战，长官欺骗我们，说新四军是土匪，被捉住要活埋，要抽筋剥皮。但我们在这里十几天吃好穿好，还给治病，早知是这样，我们早就过来了。”
    救护伤兵
    被俘的蒋军官兵争相证明这些他们亲身经历的事迹在鲁中西坡战役中，蒋军七十三军一个机枪排长因炮楼炸塌被埋，经八路军战士救出后，指导员为他讲解国内形势，卫生员替他包扎伤口，战士们给他喝水吸烟，这种亲切的关怀，终于使这个偏激和固执的排长感动了。他指着被卫生员包扎好枪伤说：“这是连长因我抵抗不坚决打的枪伤，想不到竟叫八路同志给包扎了”。随即感愧交集抱头痛哭道：“我们叫蒋介石出卖了，误把八路军当作敌人，真太不应该”。山东即墨北灵山战斗中，蒋军五十四军排长石玉轩亲睹八路军战士冒着炮火抢救被蒋军遗弃的伤员感慨的说：“八路军对待敌俘真是仁义之至了”。晋北聚乐堡战斗中，有一个从未上过火线的马占山部文书吴生负伤被俘，经八路军救护送入后方野战医院治疗，伤愈后说：“不是遇到八路军，我就会像死狗一样的给拖到荒野里了，我宁死再也不当马占山的兵了”。晋南战斗中被蒋军抛弃之三十一师九一、九二团连长以下伤员三百余人，全为八路军救护治愈，并向士兵告诉这件事情、并号召他们和八路军合作。邹平战役中被俘蒋军官兵抵我军后方后，就洗澡理发换衣服，把肮脏不洁的面容修饰得眉清目秀了。七十三军陈乐泉连长不知如何形容的说：“八路军上上下下都对我这样好，就是亲生父母也不能照顾得如此周到”。
    一视同仁
    来自非蒋介石嫡系的桂军一七二旅连长胡树生说：“我们广西军越编越少，蒋介石嫡系部队越编越多，装备也好，我干了五六年连长，真干得腻了，还不知道能不能保得下去。我想，替蒋介石打内战打死不值得，又听说新四军很好，所以枪声一响，我们就过来了。如今在这里住了几天，更清楚新四军名声话不虚传”。苏北战役中过来的新七旅副营长罗心喜说：“我们旅内派系复杂，‘伪中央军’、‘真中央军’、川军什么都有，四川行伍出身的‘土棍子’和国民党陆军大学毕业的‘斗争不休，‘真中央’‘伪中央’亦纠缠不清，但‘土棍子’最吃不开，因不是嫡系”。蒋军六十五军少校宣传干事张易生说：“蒋介石调六十五军离开广东投入内战当炮灰，就是要消灭异己，我们应当坚决保卫抗战荣誉，反对内战”。
    这些向来被歧视遭受不平等待遇的所谓“杂牌”军官兵，现在十分看清楚了蒋介石消灭异己借刀杀人的祸心。他们对解放区军民热忱欢迎殷勤招呼和一视同仁的待遇莫不由衷感谢。
    解放区才是我们的家
    有些蒋俘想退伍回家，八路军根据优待俘虏政策就遣送他们返乡，发路费送礼物开欢送会。山东军区八九两个月内即遣送一一九三名，发路费四百余万元。华中送返泰（兴）如（皋）战役中一四九名蒋俘时，除发路费外，还补充他们每人鞋袜毛巾和其他日用品。陇海前线五十五师王兴国连长等都流泪感谢说：“共产党如同再生恩人”。
    这些高高兴兴离去的蒋俘又难过蒋介石区的鬼门关，八月初旬在海安李堡战斗负伤被俘之蒋军四十九师三一四团传令兵张云立等十八名，新四军根据他们的志愿遣送，但当他们抵达原部时，即被蒋方击毙十二名。原来蒋军当官的害怕这些俘虏回来揭露他们的欺骗，所以下了这样的毒手。张等侥幸逃出，辗转回解放区，新四军即将他们送入医院疗养，他们都感动的说：“解放区才是我们的家。”
    掉转枪口反对蒋介石、美国。
    蒋介石投入内战火坑的蒋军官兵逐渐认识清楚蒋介石与美帝国主义才是他们的敌人。华中李堡战斗中罢战的新七旅副旅长田从云说：“美帝国主义援助蒋介石打内战与日本帮助汪精卫性质相同”。许多蒋军俘虏们都以戴着“汉奸帽子”（蒋军士兵对美国式军帽的称呼）为羞耻，同蒲前线被俘的胡宗南美械军一见到八路军战士，立刻抛弃了他的“汉奸帽子”，并要求把美式军服换成八路军军装。山东文祖战役中被俘的蒋九十六军暂十五师一团官兵二百余人，认清以前走错了路，自动要求参加人民队伍。在十月一日鲁中欢迎新战友大会上，该团二连李炳禄说：“今天我要向压迫过我们的反动派军阀复仇，坚决站到人民方面来”。一连代表说：“我不回家、我要参加八路军，只有打倒了反动派，才有国有家”。晚上并演出了他们自己排演的“走上光明大道”报告剧。目前在解放区各个战线上，成批觉醒了的蒋军官兵纷纷拿起武器与蒋介石英勇作战。泰（兴）如（皋）战役被俘的蒋军中一个机炮连炮手杨顺生目请炮击蒋军碉堡，连发八炮命中六炮。陇海战役中放下武器的蒋军保安队中队长葛进举行前线喊话，致使碉堡内蒋军官兵都放下武器，野鸡岗车站遂告恢复。泰兴战役中被解放的刘小堂在分界战斗中一个人打死十倍以上的敌人，缴到一门大炮，并以政治喊话争取了十二名蒋军，华中野战军立即颁予战斗模范的光荣称号。
    站到人民方面来和解放区军民在一起，拿起武器粉碎蒋介石的进攻，才是被俘蒋军官兵唯一的道路。
