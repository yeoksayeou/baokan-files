Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th: According to an Associated Press dispatch from Nanjing on the 28th, mediators from the "third party" in Nanjing claimed that if the government side continues its hostile actions, they will abandon their efforts to strive for China's peaceful unification. Qualified sources stated that the Kuomintang army's occupation of Andong and expansion of its offensive seriously endangers the third party's efforts towards peace negotiations. Most people in the capital believe that the possibility of improving the situation has now greatly diminished. According to the Associated Press, the news of the Kuomintang army continuing to expand its offensive in the Northeast was released on the 28th after Chiang Kai-shek returned to Nanjing. The third party awaited Chiang Kai-shek's return for negotiations, but when Chiang Kai-shek returned from Taiwan on the 27th, he lingered in Shanghai, paying respects to the deceased Song family at the International Cemetery and visiting Donner, a pre-war advisor, in the hospital.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th: Singapore dispatch: The Overseas Chinese Federation recently sent a joint letter to President Truman, requesting him to stop aiding the Chiang Kai-shek government and providing factual proof that American interference is hindering China from establishing peace and democracy. The letter was signed by 30,000 Overseas Chinese, Indians, Malaysians, Indonesians, and Europeans.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th: Shanghai dispatch: On the 9th of this month, the supplement of the Shanghai United Daily translated and published an article from the British Labour Party's newspaper, "New Statesman," titled "America and the Chinese Civil War," criticizing American aid to Chiang for waging civil war. It stated: "The Chinese people in the areas where the Communist army is concentrated are suffering from American bombing. China's civil war is no longer a local war between the Kuomintang and the Communists." The so-called "non-interference" of American policy is exactly like the previous non-interference of the Nazis and Italy in Spain. The article then pointed out: "As some Americans have asserted, the Military Aid to China Act makes the American President the supreme commander of the Chinese army in practice." The article concluded by advocating: "Timely aid to the progressive forces in China."

　　蒋军继续扩大东北内战
    严重危害第三方面斡旋
    【新华社延安二十九日电】据美联社南京二十八日电，南京第三方面的调解者声称：假如政府方面仍继续敌对行动，那末他们将放弃争取中国和平统一之努力。有资格人士称：国民党军之占领安东及扩大攻势，严重地危害了第三方面对和平谈判之努力。首都多数人士认为，改善局势之可能现已大大缩小。据美联社说，国民党军继续扩大东北攻势之消息，系二十八日蒋介石返京后所发。第三方面等待蒋介石归来谈判，但蒋介石于二十七日由台湾归来时，却留滞上海，作往国际公墓向宋氏亡族致了敬，及赴医院慰问战前之顾问端纳等事。
    【新华社延安二十九日电】新加坡讯：华侨联合会最近联名致函杜鲁门总统，要求停止援助蒋介石政府，并以事实证明美国的干涉防碍了中国建立和平与民主。该函签名者有三万华侨、印度人、马来人、印度尼西亚人和欧洲人。
    【新华社延安廿九日电】沪讯：本月九日上海联合日报副刊译载英工党机关报《新政治家》杂志“美国与中国内战”一文，批评美国援蒋进行内战称：中共军集中地区的中国老百姓，正遭受着美机的轰炸，中国的内战已不再是国共之间的地方战争了。而美国政策之所谓“不干涉”，其意义恰正如以前纳粹及意大利对西班牙之不干涉。该文继即指出：正如某些美国人士所断言，军事援华法案使美国总统实际上成了中国军队的最高统帅。该文结论主张：“及时援助中国的进步力量”。
