　　[This dispatch from our newspaper in Changzhi] According to a report from the Changzhi City Party Committee Office on September 29th, due to the leadership adopting thorough investigation and carrying out full ideological mobilization work, the farmers of Mafangtou Village, two *li* outside Changzhi City, and the city's merchants and residents have completely resolved the issues of tenancy and debt reasonably through agreement. The urban-rural antagonism that has persisted historically has begun to be resolved. In this mass movement, the farmers of Mafangtou Village raised a total of nineteen cases of tenancy and debt issues against the urban residents – one against a landlord, seven against middle peasants, and eleven against other poor people, small merchants, and petty citizens. The resolution of the problems roughly went through three steps: The first step was to brew solutions among the masses in Mafangtou, starting from the problems raised by each individual, and to implement the education of "all poor people are one family." This education was combined with an investigation into the living conditions of the relevant households in the city. Through discussion, the villagers clarified the idea that: "Villagers rely on the land to live, and city people rely on setting up stalls to live; we cannot wipe out the city people at once." This laid a good foundation for resolving problems through agreement. The second step was for the city cadres to negotiate with the Mafangtou cadres based on the living conditions of the city residents and reach some agreements in principle. The third step was to hold a forum where both sides raised issues for resolution. Due to sufficient preparation beforehand, the forum solved problems very smoothly. Specific solutions: A. For the ten cases belonging to tenancy issues, the principle was determined to be rent refunds, but those who could not afford to refund due to family circumstances would have their rent reduced by half or fully reduced; B. The issue of past land seizures would not be pursued. C. Care was given to the calculation method of rent refunds. The result of the solution: 13.6 *shi* of grain should have been refunded, but only 6.2 *shi* were refunded, and the remaining refunds of money and land averaged only about half. For the three cases belonging to land sales during famine years: the principle was to return the land and refund the price, but the poor could choose not to return the land, and the original owners were allowed to harvest the autumn crops. A total of 22 *mu* of land, but only 10 *mu* were returned. The masses reflected great satisfaction after the meeting, and the urban merchants completely eliminated their concerns and concentrated on doing business. The farmers of Mafangtou said happily: "Now, the people in the city and the countryside can unite as one!"

　　长治市与马坊头合理解疙瘩
    协议方式解决问题
    城乡人民加强团结
    【本报长治讯】据长治市市委办公室九月二十九日通报称：由于领导上采取了深入调查与进行了充分的思想动员工作，长治市外二里之马坊头村农民与市内商民完全用协议方式合理解决了租佃债务问题，历史上沿习下来的城乡对立已开始解决。马坊头村农民此次在群众运动中对城内群众共提出租佃债务问题十九件——对地主一件，对中农七件，对其他贫民小商人小市民十一件。问题解决大体经过三个步骤：第一步是在马坊头群众中从各个人所提的问题出发酝酿解决办法，并贯彻“天下穷人是一家”的教育。这一教育是与调查城内有关各户生活情况结合进行的，乡里人从讨论中明确了：“乡里人靠地过活，城里人靠摆摊过活，不能把城里人一下算光”的思想，这就打好了协议解决问题的基础。第二步是市内干部依据市民生活情况与马坊头干部先进行协商取得了一些原则上的协议。第三步是召开座谈会双方提出问题解决。由于事先有了充分准备工作，因此座谈会解决问题很顺利，具体解决办法：甲、属于租佃问题者十件，原则确定要退租，但家庭情况退不出者减一半或全减；乙、不究过去夺佃问题。丙、退租的计算办法上给以照顾。解决结果：应退粮十三石六斗，只退出六石二斗，其余应退款及土地平均亦只出到一半。属于荒年卖地者三件：原则上退地退价，贫苦者可不退，并让原主收秋，共地二十二亩只退地十亩。会后群众反映极满意，城市商人完全解除了顾虑安心大做买卖。马坊头农民高兴的说：“这一下城里乡里的人可团结成一条心啦！”
