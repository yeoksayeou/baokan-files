　　Responding to the Movement for US Troops to Withdraw from China
    Border Council Convenes Symposium with Various Circles
    [Our Newspaper, Handan News] On October 29th, the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Area Council invited more than 30 people, including dignitaries from all walks of life, mass leaders, and labor heroes, to a symposium to respond to the movement for US troops to withdraw from China. Deputy Speaker Tu Yun'an of the Central Plains Military Region also attended. First, Deputy Speaker Xing explained the significance of the symposium. Then, Deputy Speaker Tu of the Central Plains Military Region said angrily: "The American imperialist elements send troops to be stationed in China, interfere in China's internal affairs, infringe on China's territorial sovereignty, and help the Chiang bandits fight the civil war. It is truly outrageous. We want them to get out quickly!" Mr. Shi Minxing, a National Representative from Henan, said even more passionately: "Chiang Kai-shek has done too much to betray the country and harm the people. We must not only settle new scores with him, but also pursue old debts. If we treat Chiang Kai-shek as a perfect person, we will suffer perfectly; if we treat him as one tenth of a person, we will suffer one tenth. He has no Chinese humanity left at all. Good does not accumulate without prosperity, and evil does not accumulate without destruction. Chiang Kai-shek should have been finished long ago. Now he is only relying on his American father to make a final struggle. We demand that the US military withdraw from China immediately." Jia Guangyao, Vice President of the Higher Court, criticized from a legal point of view: "The US assistance to Chiang's civil war is not just abetting, but a joint principal offender with Chiang Kai-shek. The US military's stationing in allied countries is clearly a violation of the Atlantic Charter's decision to safeguard the independence and democracy of all countries. The crimes of murder, plunder, and rape committed by the United States in China are illegal crimes at any time and in any country. We should file a complaint with the United Nations General Assembly to urge the US military to withdraw from China as soon as possible." Subsequently, labor heroes Wang Zhengqi and Li Shuande (female), Secretary-General Wang of the Border Council, Director of the Civil Affairs Department, and Border Government Committee members Wang Zhenhua and Yan Shuyuan, Central Plains Military Region Senators Gao Yunhui, Ren Hebin, and Lian Yinong spoke one after another. Finally, Deputy Speaker Xing cited historical facts to illustrate the collusion between the US and Chiang Kai-shek. We must not have any illusions about them. Only through resolute struggle can we win peace. He also summarized everyone's unanimous opinions and decided: 1. To file a complaint with the United Nations General Assembly against the atrocities of the US military. 2. To send telegrams of appreciation to the American Committee for Peace and the Democratic Far East Policy Committee and request that they continue to carry out the movement for the withdrawal of US troops from China. 3. To question President Truman why he did not fulfill his promises. 4. To request the Preparatory Committee of the People's Congress of the Liberated Areas in Yan'an to convene the People's Congress of the Liberated Areas as soon as possible. The meeting adjourned at 4 p.m. (Kai Feng)

　　响应美军退出中国运动
    边参会召集各界座谈
    【本报邯郸讯】十月二十九日，晋冀鲁豫边区参议会，邀请各界贤达、群众领袖、劳动英雄等三十余人，座谈响应美军退出中国运动。中原军区涂副议长云庵等亦莅临参加。首由邢副议长说明此次座谈意义后，中原军区涂副议长气愤的说：“美帝国主义分子派军驻在中国，干涉中国内政，侵犯中国领土主权，帮助蒋贼打内战，真真岂有此理，要他们赶快滚蛋！”河南国大代表时敏行老先生更激昂的说：“蒋介石卖国害民的账实在太多了，我们不但要和他算新账，还要和他追旧账，如果我们拿蒋介石当十分人看，就会吃十分亏；拿他当一分人看，就会吃一分亏，他已经没有一点中国人性存在。善不积不兴，恶不积不灭，蒋介石早就应该完蛋了，现在他只是依靠他的美国爸爸来作最后挣扎，我们要求美军立即退出中国。”高等法院副院长贾光尧以法律观点批判说：“美助蒋内战，不只是帮凶，而且和蒋介石是共同正犯，美国在盟员国驻军，显然是违反大西洋宪章维护各国独立民主的决定。美国在中国杀人、掳掠、奸淫等罪行，在任何时间，任何国家，都是违法罪行，我们应向联合国大会提出控告，促使美军迅速退出中国。”接着，有边区劳动英雄王正气、李拴的（女），边参会王秘书长、民政厅长及边府委员王振华、阎庶苑，中原军区参议员高云晖任鹤宾及连以农等先后发言。最后邢副议长列举历史事实说明美蒋的狼狈为奸，我们对他们不能存有任何幻想，只有坚决奋斗，才能赢得和平。并总结大家一致意见，决定：一、向联合国大会提出对美军暴行的控诉。二、向美国争取和平委员会及民主远东政策委员会致电慰谢并请继续开展美军退出中国运动。三、质问杜鲁门总统为什么不实践自己的诺言。四、请求延安解放区人民代表会筹委会迅速召开解放区人民代表会议。下午四时散会。（凯风）
