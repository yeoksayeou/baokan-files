　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 25th: "One party attempts to monopolize power, and the country eventually splits." This is the Tianjin Dagongbao's comment on the Kuomintang authorities' attempt to pass a dictatorial "constitution" in its one-party-controlled so-called "National Assembly" on the 21st. The editorial revealed: "A Kuomintang legislator shouted loudly during the deliberation of the draft constitution: 'Only those who believe in our doctrine can be our citizens.' This means that a group with the same appearance and inner thoughts forms a country, and those who do not believe in 'our' doctrine should be excluded from the country of 'our' group." The editorial continued: "China's autocratic system began with Qin Shi Huang and has the following characteristics: concentrating power in one person and concentrating thought in one brain. The 'trust' in autocracy voiced by the Legislative Yuan has not dug out Qin Shi Huang's nest. This kind of ideological autocracy is extremely violent subjectively and forces the country to split and the world to be in chaos objectively."
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 25th: The New York Herald Tribune editorial on the 19th denounced "Chiang Kai-shek's insistence on one-party dictatorship, denying the Chinese people democracy, and plunging the country into the chaos of civil war." It also stated: "Although Chiang claimed to 'return power to the people' in the National Assembly, his audience was all reactionary elements—the extremely conservative elements who control the Kuomintang's ruling apparatus. Not only the CCP, but also most minority parties have refused to participate in the 'National Assembly.' The reason why those who are not communists do not participate in the 'National Assembly' is because they anticipate that the 'National Assembly' cannot write a democratic constitution. What they see is only the tentacles of the Kuomintang's right-wing corrupt and incompetent elements, the ropes that bind China." The newspaper also stated: "Chiang Kai-shek will use American financial and military assistance to engage in several years of work to defeat the CCP, which is truly a losing game." The Washington Star stated: "The convening of the National Assembly makes China like an iceberg, with seven-eighths submerged below the waterline." The New York Times stated on the 17th: "The National Assembly is meeting in an atmosphere of gloom and disappointment, because the National Assembly is only a disguised unity. Impatient Americans can no longer hope that politically backward China can become a democratic country overnight." The Christian Science Monitor stated briefly on the 15th: "No one will think that a new era has already begun in China with the convening of the National Assembly. The United States requires China to have a National Assembly with democratic intentions." The St. Louis Post-Dispatch stated briefly on the 18th: "The National Assembly is attempting to whitewash the continuation of the old rule. Those who harbor this deceptive attempt believe—or at least hope—that other countries are easily deceived. This kind of disguise will not help. This deception is also very obvious. Chiang Kai-shek's best policy should be to dissolve the National Assembly and then step back and promote the establishment of a coalition government in China."
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 25th: According to a United Press dispatch from Nanjing on the 23rd: When the "National Assembly" was scheduled to hold its first formal meeting on Monday (the 25th), it had received secret indictments accusing many "National Assembly representatives" of engaging in traitorous activities during the Anti-Japanese War. According to a Reuters dispatch from Nanjing on the 24th: More than a hundred reporters, neutral figures, and even "National Assembly representatives" who were attending the "National Assembly" all believed that the "National Assembly" was entirely a play staged by the Kuomintang.

　　中外舆论猛抨蒋贼分裂独裁
    促蒋立即解散伪国大
    【新华社延安二十五日电】“一党力图独霸，国家终于分裂。”这是天津大公报二十一日对国民党当局企图在其一手包办的所谓“国大”中通过独裁“宪法”的评论。该社论透露：“国民党某立法委员在审议宪草时大声疾呼说：‘相信我们的主义，才能做我们的国民。’这即是说，同面貌同内心的一群结合成一个国家，那些不相信‘我们’的主义的那一大群，‘他们’就应被拒绝于‘我们’一群的国家之外。”该社论继指出：“中国专制政体由秦始皇为始，有以下的特点：就是集权力于一人，集思想于一个脑袋。立法院所发出的‘信任’专制的呼声，不曾挖出秦始皇的窠臼。这种思想专制，在主观上是无比凶暴，在客观上迫使国家分裂，天下大乱。”
    【新华社延安二十五日电】纽约先驱论坛报十九日社论指斥“蒋介石坚持一党专政，不予中国人民以民主，而使国家陷于内战之混乱中。”并称：“在国大中蒋虽口称‘还政于民’，但渠之听众都是反动分子——控制国民党统治机构的极端保守派。不但中共，而且大多数少数党均已拒绝参加‘国大’。那些并非共产党的人所以不参加‘国大’，是因为他们预料到‘国大’不能写出民主的宪法。他们所见到的宪法，只是国民党右派腐败无能分子的触角，束缚中国的绳索。”该报并称：“蒋介石将以美国之金融与军事援助从事数年之击溃中共工作，此诚为一局输棋。”华盛顿星报称：“国大之召开，使中国犹如冰山八分之七均沉没在水平线之下。”纽约时报十七日称：“国大在阴暗而失望之气氛中开会，盖国大仅为一伪装之团结也。不耐烦之美国人民已不能再希望政治落后之中国能于一朝夕间成为民主国之一。”基督教科学箴言报十五日略称：“国大召开，任何人不会认为是中国新时代业已展开。美国要求中国应有有民主意向的国大。”圣路易斯邮报十八日略称：“国大企图为持续旧统治粉饰。怀有此项故弄玄虚企图之人，都相信——或至少希望——他国是容易欺骗的。此种伪装，将无济于事。此项骗局，亦极明显。蒋介石的上策应为解散国大，继即退而促使中国成立一联合政府。”
    【新华社延安二十五日电】据合众社南京二十三日电：当“国大”定于星期一（二十五日）开第一次正式会议时，已接获控告许多“国大代表”在抗战时期进行汉奸活动的秘密控告书。又据路透社南京二十四日电：旁听“国大”的百余记者、中立方面人士、以至“国大代表”们，都认为“国大”无论如何全然是国民党演的一出戏。
