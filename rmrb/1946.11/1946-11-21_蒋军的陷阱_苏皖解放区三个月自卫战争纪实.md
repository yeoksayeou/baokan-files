　　Jiang Jun's Trap
    ——A True Record of the Three-Month Self-Defense War in the Suwan Liberated Area
    Xu Nuo
    Standing before the advancing shadow of Chiang Kai-shek are 24 million resolute and unyielding people of the fully liberated Suwan area, tempered by eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan. They supported and joined the New Fourth Army, resolutely resisting the invaders and inflicting significant casualties upon them. They widely launched guerrilla warfare, setting up an inescapable net for the Chiang troops who ventured deep.
    On July 13th, Chiang Kai-shek concentrated 30 divisions (now reorganized as brigades) to attack the Suwan Liberated Area. After the seven consecutive victories of the Suzhong military and civilians in self-defense counterattacks, by the end of August, the Chiang troops had suffered 60,000 casualties (including 35,000 captured), accounting for more than half of the attacking southern front forces. Adding to this the more than 4,000 annihilated in the Yugou Campaign on the northern front, the more than 1,000 captured in the outer defenses of Sixian County (August 7th to 10th), the more than 5,000 annihilated on the Huaiyin front, and the blows dealt to the Chiang troops by various local corps and people's guerrillas over the past three months, the total losses of the Chiang troops are at least over 75,000. As many as ten generals were captured, including two brigade commanders (formerly division commanders), six deputy brigade commanders (formerly deputy division commanders), and two brigade chiefs of staff (formerly division chiefs of staff). Eight entire brigades (formerly divisions) and two traffic corps (missing only one battalion and one corps headquarters) were completely annihilated, and no less than ten brigades suffered partial blows. The casualties of the New Fourth Army were only in a ratio of 1 to 17 compared to the losses of the Chiang troops. Due to the people's enthusiastic enlistment in the army and the transfer of some Chiang troops who refused to fight, the main force of the Suwan New Fourth Army has doubled compared to the beginning, and its weaponry and combat skills are far better than before. The American-equipped weapons that the Sino-American reactionaries used to intimidate people have now been completely transferred to the hands of several divisions of the New Fourth Army.
    In this confrontation, the people's army demonstrated extreme ingenuity and bravery. In the Yugou Campaign, a combat team of three men from the fourth squad of the second company of a certain unit of the New Fourth Army, led by Xia Zhendian, engaged in hand-to-hand combat with Chiang troops, resulting in the killing and wounding of 14 Chiang soldiers. Another combat team led by Xin Wuping repelled an attack by more than 100 Chiang soldiers and seized two heavy machine guns. During the Shaobo defense battle in late August, two platoons of a certain unit of the New Fourth Army held the Yangqiao position, repelling continuous assaults by a regiment of Chiang troops with five bayonet charges and 500 hand grenades. Soldier Li Liubao hit six invaders with nine shots. Such models of combat are too numerous to mention. As for the unjust and unrighteous Chiang troops, apart from a small number who are temporarily deceived, no one with a sense of national consciousness and justice is willing to make a pointless sacrifice for the traitorous and dictatorial Chiang Kai-shek. Xi Shengkai, the deputy brigade commander (division changed to brigade) of the 92nd Brigade (division changed to brigade) of the Chiang troops who laid down their weapons in the Yugou Campaign, said: "I am extremely unwilling to participate in the civil war. When I heard the sound of gunfire, my mood immediately dropped to freezing point. When Chief of Staff Liu asked me how to handle it, I immediately ordered the laying down of weapons." Hu Guisheng, the company commander of the fifth company of the second battalion of the 514th Regiment of the 172nd Brigade of the Chiang troops, said: "Our Guangxi army is getting smaller and smaller, and Chiang Kai-shek's direct line troops are getting bigger and bigger. There is no way out for 'miscellaneous troops.' When your guns fired, I said to my brothers: it is not worth dying in the civil war. I heard that the New Fourth Army is very good, let's all go over there. Everyone responded, and the brothers of the fifth company all followed." Yang Zhongkao and more than 200 other soldiers of the second battalion of the 135th Regiment of the 45th Brigade of the Chiang troops who refused to fight in the Wenjiawa battle in Tianchang jointly issued a telegram calling on the Chiang troops to oppose the civil war, further teaching their own experience: "When you are on the front line, point your guns to the sky, and if you have the opportunity, run over here. If the officials force the brothers to die, turn your guns and kill them!" The vast number of soldiers and lower-level officers, and even some higher-level officers, of the Chiang troops were unwilling to fight in the civil war. Combined with the strong resistance of the people's armed forces, they laid down their weapons in the thousands.
    Wherever the Chiang troops invaded, they used a group of lackeys they brought with them to establish so-called county governments, but the Chiang-appointed county magistrates were actually only equivalent to self-proclaimed street chiefs or "hundred-step kings." One and a half li outside the city is all liberated area. Not to mention the newly occupied areas, even in the coastal areas along the Yangtze River such as Nantong and Rugao, which the Central News Agency boasted were "completely under the control of the National Army," a new Ninth Sub-district was opened in the Suwan border area, and even a democratic county government was established on Chongming Island, which is isolated at the mouth of the Yangtze River. The Jashan, Lai'an, and Xuyi areas in Huainan were occupied earlier as the rear of the Chiang troops. Between the above three counties, there are still 45 villages under the rule of the democratic government. When the Chiang troops occupying Gucheng (south of Xuyi) sent out village chiefs three times, they were all driven away by the local militia, who then recovered the area. The Chiang troops occupying Lingbi once established four township offices in the south of the county, which were immediately wiped out by the militia in one sweep. Zhou Daoping, the Chiang-appointed county magistrate of Haimen, twice led hundreds of armed men out of the city for "mopping up," but were both mopped up back by the militia. It is forever impossible for the Chiang regime to penetrate deep into the vast countryside. Huangqiao was occupied by the Chiang troops for 45 days and a so-called government was established. When the New Fourth Army liberated Huangqiao again at the end of August, thousands of militiamen automatically rose up and arrested 300 people, such as village chiefs and squad leaders, and most of the Chiang-appointed "homecoming corps" members were caught. Since the implementation of the land reform of "land to the tiller," the people's regime has become even stronger and more solid. In the turn-over movement, a large number of farm laborers, poor peasants, handicraftsmen, and women in Suwan have become cadres in governments at all levels, they are both the government and the people. To eliminate such a regime, it would be necessary to eliminate all the people in the liberated area, but this is impossible.
    In order to subdue the people of Suwan, Chiang Kai-shek adopted a "ten-all" policy that was even more ruthless than the "three-all" policy invented by the Japanese devils; however, the people of Suwan responded to him with comprehensive resistance and persistent resistance. Under the slogans of "Protect the land and protect the hometown" and "Always follow the same path as the Communist Party and the New Fourth Army," tens of thousands of Suwan people poured into the main forces and local corps, and hundreds of thousands of men and women organized countless guerrillas and militias on the spot. Under the slogan of "Everything for our own victory," they participated in the rear service movement to support the front line, creating a general upsurge. In the Xuanjiabao battle in Taixing, more than 100,000 people assisted in the battle and participated in rear service. Several thousand militiamen also assisted in the Yugou battle. In addition to cooperating with the regular army in combat, the militia and guerrillas in various parts of Suwan fought independently more than 2,000 times, killing, wounding, and capturing 5,000 to 6,000 Chiang soldiers, and recovering dozens of Chiang military strongholds. They needed weapons, so they went to the enemy to seize them. On August 1st, the Rugao South Guerrilla team intercepted 400 boxes of ammunition from the Chiang troops, totaling 2 million rounds of ammunition, and burned 7 trucks. On July 22nd, the Jingjiang Guerrilla team captured 17 military vessels of the Chiang troops in one operation. On September 4th, the Xuefeng (Yongcheng) militia ambushed a Chiang military engineering battalion at Jiangkou, seizing 30 large carts of ammunition. Now, the Suzhong militia not only has rifles, but also American weapons such as carbines and tommy guns. They sabotaged transportation, making it more difficult for the Chiang troops to transport supplies. 4,000 militiamen on the Yangzhou-Taizhou line destroyed 25 li of road, destroyed two large bridges and one blockhouse in one operation. The highways in Nantong, Rugao, Hai'an, and Taizhou in southern Suzhong and Sixian, Wuhe, and Lingbi in northern Jiangsu, which were controlled by the Chiang troops, were often impassable. They were good at attacking. On July 31st, the Suxian Guerrilla team attacked Yiji, annihilating two companies of Chiang troops and capturing 51 alive. They were also good at attacking strongholds. On September 18th, the Suining local guerrilla team captured Daliji, annihilating 200 Chiang soldiers. They were also good at defending. In late September, the Chiang troops attacked Huangqiao fiercely with a regiment of troops. The militia held out for four days and nights, repelling the Chiang troops at the minor cost of two to thirty, The Chiang troops want to press-gang men, and they counter-press-gang men. On July 17th, the Jingjiang militia attacked Jijiashi, rescuing more than 1,000 residents who had been kidnapped. On August 27th, the Taixing militia rescued more than 500 able-bodied men who had been stolen by the Chiang troops to the liberated area. Sometimes they did not rely on weapons, but used wisdom to win. Wang Laizi from Hai'an used his knowledge of the way to lead 20 Chiang soldiers into the defense area of the New Fourth Army, where they surrendered. Wherever the Chiang troops invaded, there were people's guerrillas. When the Chiang troops had not yet arrived at Hongze Lake, the fishermen with thousands of duck guns had organized a self-defense team. When the news of the large-scale attack by the Chiang troops reached Lianshui, Wang Fengshan, a well-known anti-Japanese militia hero, reorganized his old troops and is now stepping up the training of gunners and rushing to build landmines. The people in the rear participated in various logistics organizations, supported the front line, or used savings production to contribute all their strength to support the war of self-defense.
    This is the price that Chiang Kai-shek paid and the answer he received for attacking Suwan for three months. In the future, the price he will pay will be even more and greater, until the invaders are completely driven out.

　　蒋军的陷阱
    ——苏皖解放区三个月自卫战争纪实
    许诺
    站在蒋介石进攻魔影面前的，是两千四百万经过八年抗日战争锻炼的刚毅不屈的苏皖全解放区人民。他们支持和参加了新四军，对进犯者实行坚强的抗击，并予以重大杀伤。他们广泛开展游击战，给冒险深入的蒋军布下天罗地网。
    七月十三日，蒋介石集中三十个师（现改旅）向苏皖解放区进攻，经过苏中军民自卫反击的七战七捷，至八月底止，蒋军被歼达六万人（内三万五千被俘），占进攻南线兵力的一半还多。加上北线渔沟战役就歼四千余人，泗县外围被俘千余人（八月七日至十日），淮阴前线被歼五千余人，还有三个月来各地方兵团与人民游击队给予蒋军的打击，总计蒋军损失至少在七万五千人以上，被俘将级军官达十个之多，内尚有旅长（原师长）二人，副旅长（原副师长）六人，旅参谋长（原师参谋长）二人，八个整旅（原师）及两个交通总队（仅缺一个大队及一个总队部）全部就歼，受到部分打击者不下十个旅。而新四军伤亡与蒋军损失数仅为一与十七之比。由于人民的热烈参军与一部蒋军罢战兵员的转入人民队伍，苏皖新四军主力比起初增多了一倍，武器装备与作战技术更远非昔比。过去中美反动派借以吓人的美械装备，已经有好几个师全部转到了新四军手里。
    在这个交锋中，人民军队表现了极端机智和英勇。渔沟战役新四军某部二连四班一个由三人组成的战斗小组，在夏振田率领下，和蒋军肉搏结果，三个人毙伤蒋军十四名。以辛五平为首的另一个战斗小组，打垮了蒋军百余人的进攻，夺获了两挺重机枪。八月下旬邵伯保卫战役中，新四军某部两个排坚守洋桥阵地，以五次白刃战与五百个手榴弹打退了蒋军一个团的连续冲锋。战士李六宝九枪击中六个进犯者。像这样的战斗模范，是举不胜举的。而不仁不义的蒋军，除一部分暂时被蒙蔽者外，凡是有民族观念与正义感的人，谁也不愿为卖国独裁的蒋介石作无谓的牺牲品。在渔沟战役中放下武器的蒋军九十二旅（师改）副旅长洗盛楷说：“本人极不愿参加内战，此次听到枪声一响，我心绪即降到冰点。当秩序紊乱时，刘参谋长问我如何处理，我即下令放下武器。”蒋军一七二旅五一四团二营五连连长胡桂生说：“我们广西军越编越少，蒋介石嫡系部队越编越多。‘杂牌’没有出路。当着你们的枪一响，我就对弟兄们说：内战打死不值得，听说新四军那边很好，我们都过去吧。一呼百应，五连弟兄就都跟着过来了。”在天长闻家洼战役中罢战的蒋军四十五旅一三五团二营士兵杨忠考等二百余联名号召蒋军士兵反内战的通电中，更传授自己的经验“上了火线，枪口朝天放，有机会就跑到这边来。那个当官的逼迫弟兄们送死，就掉转枪口干掉他！”蒋军广大士兵中下级军官，甚至一部分上级军官，都是不愿内战的，又遇到人民武装的坚强抵抗，所以就成千成万地放下了武器。
    蒋军侵占之处，就利用他们带来的一批喽罗成立所谓县政府之类，可是蒋记县长实际上只等于自封的街长或百步大王，离城一里半里就都是解放区。还不要说是新侵占区，就是如中央社自吹“已完全在国军控制下”的南通、如皋等沿江滨海地区，苏皖边区，在那里又新辟了一个第九分区，连孤悬扬子江口的崇明岛上也成立了民主县政府。淮南嘉山、来安、盱眙地区，是被侵占较早的蒋军后方，上述三县之间，至今还有四十五个乡的辖地在民主政府治下，当侵占古城（盱眙南）蒋军三次派出乡长时，均被当地民兵驱逐，随后并将该地收复了。侵占灵壁蒋军曾在该县南部安设了四个乡公所，随即被民兵一次扫光。海门蒋记县长周道平，曾两度率武装数百人出城“扫荡”，结果均被民兵反扫了回去。蒋政权想深入广大乡村是永远不可能的。黄桥是被蒋军侵占了四十五天并建立了所谓政府的，当新四军于八月底再度解放黄桥时，数千民兵自动起来搜捕了什么乡长、队长之类三百个，蒋记“还乡团”员大部落网。自从实行了“耕者有其田”的土地改革以后，人民政权是更强壮坚实了。在翻身运动中，苏皖各地已有大批的雇农、贫农、手工业者、妇女成了各级政权干部，他们是政府又是人民。要想消灭这样的政权，除非消灭所有解放区的人民，然而这是不可能的。
    蒋介石为了想降服苏皖人民，曾采用了比日本鬼子所发明的“三光”还多七光的“十光”政策；但是，苏皖人民给他的回答是全面抵抗，持久抵抗。在“保田地保家乡”“永远和共产党新四军走一条路”的口号下，苏皖人民成千成万地涌入了主力部队和地方兵团，数十万男女就地组织了无数的游击队和民兵，他们在一个“一切为着自己的胜利”口号下，参加后勤支援前线运动，造成了普遍的热潮。泰兴宣家堡战役，助战与参加后勤的群众在十万以上，渔沟战役中也有数千民兵助战。他们除配合正规军作战外，苏皖各地民兵游击队曾单独作战两千多次，毙伤俘蒋军五六千人，收复蒋军据点数十处，他们需要武装就向敌人去夺取八月一日如（皋）南游击队一次截获蒋军弹药四百箱，计有子弹两百万发，焚毁汽车七辆。七月二十二日，静江游击队一次俘获蒋军军用船只十七艘。九月四日，雪枫（即永城）民兵在蒋口伏击蒋军工兵营，缴弹药三十大车。现在，苏中民兵不仅有机步枪，并且有了卡宾式与汤姆式等美式武器。他们破坏交通，使蒋军运输补给增加困难。扬（州）泰（州）线民兵四千人，一次破路二十五里，毁大桥二座，炮楼一座。蒋军控制下的苏中南（通）如（皋）海（安）泰（州），苏北的泗（县）五（河）、灵（壁）等公路，经常不能通车。他们善于袭击。七月三十一日，宿县游击队袭击义集，歼蒋军两连，生俘五十一名。他们也善于攻据点。九月十八日，睢宁地方游击队攻克大李集，歼蒋军二百。他们还善于防守。九月下旬，蒋军以一团兵力，猛攻黄桥，民兵坚守四昼夜，以二比三十的轻微代价，击退了蒋军。蒋军要抓丁，他们就反抓丁。靖江民兵七月十七日袭击季家市，救出被绑居民千余人。泰兴民兵八月二十七日中途救出被蒋军偷到解放区绑架的壮丁五百余名。他们有时不是依靠武器，而是运用智慧获胜利的。海安王癞子利用带路，把二十名蒋军引入新四军防地俯首就擒。蒋军侵犯到那里，那里就有人民的游击队。当蒋军还没有到洪泽湖的时候，该湖拥有数千鸭枪的渔民已组织了自卫队，当蒋军大举进攻的消息一传到涟水以后，抗日有名的民兵英雄王凤山，即重整旧部，现正加紧训练炮手，赶造地雷。后方的人民则参加各种后勤组织，支援前线，或用节约生产贡献一切力量支援自卫的战争。
    这就是蒋介石进攻苏皖三个月所付的代价和得到的回答，以后他所付的代价还要更多更大，直到侵犯者完全被赶出去。
