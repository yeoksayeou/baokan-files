    Taihang Third Administrative Office Sends Letter to Comfort Anyang Cadres, Militia Awarded 150,000 Yuan and 50 Shi of Millet.
    [Our Newspaper] Li Yiyun and Liu Zhengtian, the chief and deputy commissioners of the Taihang Third Administrative Office, recently sent a personal letter to Ma Li and Liu Lin, the chief and deputy county heads of Anyang, to express their condolences to the Anyang county, district, and village cadres and militiamen who fought bravely against the enemy in hardship. They also awarded them 150,000 yuan in cash and 50 shi of millet. The original letter stated, in essence, that during the tense struggle, a large number of model individuals emerged in Anyang and should be commended and encouraged. The letter ended by encouraging everyone to strive for new victories in the new and more intense struggle. It is reported that the Anyang County Government has issued an order to all districts to register model cadres and militiamen for commendation and rewards.
