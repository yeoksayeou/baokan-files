Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, Eighteenth: Nanjing Dispatch: Executive Yuan President of the Kuomintang, Song Ziwen, announced on the 17th that "the Executive Yuan has decided to extend the import permit method to all imported goods, and this method will be implemented immediately." He also announced the establishment of a temporary import management committee in charge, with Song Ziwen's henchman, the current President of the Central Bank, Bei Zuyi, as the director. This is another huge "corpse-like" organization by which the four families of Chiang, Song, Kong, and Chen monopolize the domestic market. From now on, China's import trade will be completely controlled by the four families.
