　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th: According to a delayed Associated Press report from Manila: An anti-government uprising has recently occurred south of Manila. The 5,000-strong rebel army, calling themselves "the People," issued a declaration advocating the overthrow of the Roxas government, which is controlled by American imperialism and foreign fascists. The rebel army is composed of guerrillas who are dissatisfied with the government. This action has directly aided the self-defense operations of the Philippine People's Army (led by the Philippine Communist Party, formerly an anti-Japanese guerrilla force, numbering approximately 50,000, with bases in central Luzon) north of Manila. Since the American-equipped Philippine government army launched a full-scale offensive against the People's Anti-Japanese Army in September, the army has continuously used mobile warfare to strike the enemy, thwarting the government army's attempts to engage in a decisive battle with the main force. Currently, the People's Anti-Japanese Army has moved from Nueva Ecija province, north of Manila, to Tarlac and Pampanga provinces, northwest of Manila. A Reuters report states: The assembled People's Anti-Japanese Army frequently attacks the government army's weak points. In a recent raid, 1,000 People's Anti-Japanese Army troops attacked Minarin Town, 100 miles north of Manila, killing and capturing 28 defending soldiers and seizing a large amount of supplies.

　　不堪美菲法西斯压迫
    菲人五千起义
    民抗军屡创美械政府军
    【新华社延安十八日电】据美联社马尼拉迟到消息：马尼拉以南近又发生反政府起义，五千起义军以“人民”为番号，发表宣言，主张打倒美帝国主义及外国法西斯主义者控制下的罗哈斯政府。起义军队，系由不满政府的游击队所组成。此项行动，已直接援助了马尼拉以北菲人民军（为菲共领导下的前抗日游击队，约五万人，在吕宋中部拥有根据地）的自卫作战。自九月间美械菲政府军对民抗军展开全面进攻以来，该军不断以机动作战，打击敌人，使政府军寻找主力决战的企图未能实现。现民抗军已自马尼拉北的兰伐伊西哈省移至马尼拉西北的达拉克省与邦邦加省。路透社消息报导：集结的民抗军经常袭击政府军弱点，最近一次一千民抗军突袭马尼拉北一百英里的民纳林镇，毙俘守军二十八名，缴获甚多。
