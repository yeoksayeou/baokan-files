[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] To adapt to the needs of the war, the organizational forms and working methods of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Government have been rapidly changed. Government agencies, under the principle of centralized use of cadres, have drastically reduced personnel. More than half of the cadres were transferred to form four streamlined work teams, which went to the four strategic areas of Ji'nan, Ji'lu'yu, Taihang, and Taiyue to help inspect the work. All agencies under the Border Government, except the Finance Department, retained only two or three people to maintain operations. To unify and concentrate the work of the agencies and improve efficiency, a collective office system was fully adopted. In the financial and economic system, all units have formed a joint financial and economic office, unifying the administrative work of the Industry and Commerce Bureau with the trade departments, striving for long-term wartime construction. The Postal Bureau continues to strengthen military postal services to serve the front lines. The Health Bureau has canceled the separate Peace Hospital. The hospital has formed a mobile medical team to go to the front lines of Ji'lu'yu to participate in battlefield medical work. Among the rear personnel of the Border Government departments, a surge of enthusiasm for serving the war has also been set off. According to a person in charge of the Border Government: The Border Government had carried out five simplifications of administration during the War of Resistance, but the mobilization for this patriotic self-defense war has been faster and the transformation of work style more thorough than any of those previous efforts. Chairman Yang returned from the front lines of Ji'lu'yu, vividly introducing the tense and arduous combat life of the soldiers and civilians in the war zone, pointing out the necessity of thoroughly changing the weary and old-fashioned work style of the rear agencies, and changing the working methods, emphasizing that all work must be subordinate to the war, and be tensely mobilized to defend Yan'an and defend Chairman Mao. This call immediately aroused a response among all cadres. Many units conducted ideological examinations, believing that there was much work at the front waiting for them to do. In some units, both the chief and deputy section chiefs competed to go to the front, and they had to undergo administrative decisions and obey organizational transfers. Although there were individual units that believed that frequent movements this year had affected the work of their units, and their understanding of the nature of the war was still not clear. Our Vice-Chairman, using the arduous work style of the 1943 rectification campaign, cadre production, and overcoming disasters as examples, encouraged everyone that in this tense period of almost reaching the top of the mountain, only by thoroughly changing the work style of the leading agencies can we promote the victory of the war by the people of the whole region.
    Now, the work teams organized by each unit have all set off, and the comrades who remain in the organs are actively and voluntarily looking for work to do. The comrades of the Secretariat used to go out for games and play cards after dinner, but now they also seize the opportunity to handle daily work after dinner and automatically compile materials sent from various places for reference by leading comrades. In addition to initiating a campaign to donate books and newspapers to comfort the troops in the border agencies, the Education Department has also been running around to unite bookstores, newspaper offices, and the cultural departments of the military region to launch a widespread campaign to donate books and newspapers to comfort the troops.

[This Newspaper News] In order to suit the current tense war situation, all units directly under the Border Government and all members of the Border Region Council held a cadre mobilization meeting on the morning of the 22nd to change the organizational form and working methods to strengthen the front-line work. More than 300 people attended, and Chairman Yang and Vice-Chairman Rong both personally gave speeches. Vice-Chairman Rong pointed out: The task of the Border Government is to organize manpower and material resources to support the front, guarantee war supplies, and check the movement of filling gaps and making up deficiencies, complete "land to the tiller," and prepare for next year's major production. Vice-Chairman Rong said: "In order to adapt to the war, the organizational form of the Border Government has been decided to be short, small, and efficient. A large number of cadres must be transferred to serve the front and go to the rear to inspect and help with work," and reminded everyone: "We must save money and use it sparingly and prepare for a long-term hard struggle." Chairman Yang called on everyone to "resolutely put down all burdens, defend Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, and defend Chairman Mao," and "establish merit for the people." Chairman Yang used the facts he saw with his own eyes to educate everyone: "The comrades who were injured on the front lines felt uneasy in the hospital because they felt they could not go to the front lines immediately. They shed blood and were injured and still remembered the spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly. Compared with them, we can only feel ashamed!" After the speech, all the cadres resolved to send a telegram to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu and Deputy Commander Peng, telling them that everyone would change their lifestyle and organizational form to defend Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia and defend Chairman Mao. They also sent a telegram to Commander Liu and Political Commissar Deng to congratulate them on the great victory in the Hua-Jun area. (Xiu Shan)

　　适应战争抽调干部赴前线
    边府改变工作方式
    杨戎正副主席号召为人民立功
    【本报特讯】晋冀鲁豫边区政府，为适应战争需要，各种组织形式及工作方式迅速得到改变。政府机构，在集中使用干部原则下，大量缩减人员，抽调一半以上干部，组成四个精简工作队，分赴冀南、冀鲁豫、太行、太岳四个战略区帮助检查工作。边府所属各机关除财政厅外，只留两三人坚持工作。为使机关工作统一集中，提高效率，完全采取集体办公制度。财经系统，各单位已组成财经联合办事处，把工商局行政工作与贸易部门统一起来，为长期战争建设努力。邮政局继续加强军邮为前线服务，卫生局已取消另设和平医院。该院已组成流动医疗队，赴冀鲁豫前方，参加战地医疗工作。在边府各部门后方工作人员中，也掀起了为战争服务的热潮。据边府某负责人谈：边府在抗战中曾进行过五次简政，一般干部均不如这次爱国自卫战争动员来得迅速与作风转变的彻底。杨主席自冀鲁豫前线归来，生动的介绍了战地军民紧张艰苦的战斗生活，指出后方机关应当彻底转变疲塌老大作风，改变工作方式的必要，强调一切工作要服从战争，为保卫延安保卫毛主席而紧张动员起来。这一号召立即在全体干部中引起了反映，许多单位都进行了思想检查，认为前方有许多工作，在等着我们去干。有些单位正副科长两人都争着要到前方工作，只好经过行政决定，服从组织调动。虽有个别单位，认为今年移动频繁，影响了本单位工作，思想上对战争性质仍无明确认识。经过我副主席以四三年机关整风、干都生产、渡过灾荒的艰苦作风为例，鼓励大家在这快要爬上山顶的紧张时期，只有彻底转变领导机关作风，才能推动全区军民争取战争的胜利。
    现在，各单位组成的工作队已经全部出发，留在机关工作同志，都积极主动的找工作做。秘书处同志，平时在晚饭后多出外游戏打扑克，现在饭后也抓紧机会处理日常工作，并自动将各地送来材料编制牵引，供领导同志参考。教育厅除在边直机关发起书报劳军，捐献书籍五百余本外，并四出奔跑，联合书店报馆及军区文化部门，发起广泛的书报劳军热潮。（冰如）
    【本报讯】为适合目前战争紧张局面，边府直属各单位及边区参议会全体人员，于二十二日上午举行改变组织形式与工作方式加强前线工作干部动员大会，到三百余人，杨戎正副主席均亲临讲话。戎副主席指出：边府任务是组织人力物力支援前线，保证战争供给，并检查填平补齐运动，完成耕者有其田，准备明年大生产。戎副主席称：“为适应战争，边府的组织形式已决定短小精干，要大量抽调干部，服务前方与到后方检查帮助工作”，并提醒大家：“我们省吃俭用，准备长期苦斗”。杨主席号召大家“坚决的放下各种包袱，保卫陕甘宁，保卫毛主席”，并“为人民建立功劳”。杨主席用亲眼看到的事实教育大家：“前线受了伤的同志，感到自己不能马上上火线，住在医院不安心，他们流血受伤还念念不忘全心全意为了人民的精神，我们和他们比较起来只有抱愧！”讲话毕，全体干部决议致电毛主席、朱彭总副司令，告诉他们大家要改变生活方式组织方式保卫陕甘宁，保卫毛主席。并电刘司令员邓政委祝贺滑浚地区大捷。（秀山）
