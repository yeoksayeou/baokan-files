    Chairman Mao Sends His Son to Study at the Labor University

    Mao Anying is Chairman Mao's son. He lived in Moscow University in the Soviet Union and recently returned from the Soviet Union. Chairman Mao said to him, "You've lived in a Soviet university, but you haven't lived in a border region labor university. The principal of the labor university is Wu Manyou, and the labor university is in Wu Family Date Orchard. The students there are all labor-loving people. Going there to study will be a great help to you." Mao Anying was willing to go. Chairman Mao said, "It's good to go, and you should also bring some tuition." Chairman Mao gave him a peck* of rice and told Mao Anying to carry it on his back and walk. He was covered in sweat when he arrived at Wu Family Date Orchard.

    As soon as Mao Anying arrived at Wu Family Date Orchard, Wu Manyou said, "You're a foreign student. I don't even know a single character. What are you going to study?" Mao Anying said, "I'm a primary school student, and I don't know anything. Don't stand on ceremony. My father sent me here to learn from you."

    Wu Manyou began to teach him. The first lesson was land reclamation. Mao Anying followed the mutual aid team to the mountains to reclaim land. He saw the people in the mutual aid team taking off their clothes to reclaim land, and he did the same. He thought, "Even the principal is reclaiming land, so the students should reclaim land even more." At noon, when the sun was blazing, he desperately studied land reclamation. His fair skin was sunburned red, then turned black, and the skin was burned dead. After two or three days, he learned how to reclaim land.

    Mao Anying studied for two weeks and learned how to reclaim land, apply fertilizer, weed, sow seeds, and plow. Wu Manyou said, "Mao Anying can farm just like our mutual aid team."

    毛主席送子住劳动大学
    毛岸英是毛主席的儿子，他在苏联住过莫斯科大学，最近才从苏联回来。毛主席对他说：“你住过苏联的大学，还没有住过边区劳动大学，劳动大学的校长就是吴满有，劳动大学就在吴家枣园，那里的学生，都是爱劳动的人民，你去学习，对你有很大的帮助。”毛岸英愿意去。毛主席说：“去很好，还要带些学费去。”毛主席给了一斗米，叫毛岸英背上走，走到吴家枣园，累得他满头大汗。
    毛岸英刚到吴家枣园，吴满有说：“你是个洋学生，咱一个字也不识，学什么呀？”毛岸英说：“我是个小学生，啥事也不懂的，你不要客气，我爸爸让我来，向你学习”。
    吴满有就开始教了。第一课开荒，毛岸英跟上变工队，上山开荒。他看见变工队的人，都把衣服脱下来开荒，他也同样去做。心想：“连校长都开荒，学生更应当开荒。”中午太阳正红的时候，他拚命地学开荒，白白的皮肉，被太阳晒得红红的，由红变黑，把皮也晒死了。过了两三天，他就学会开荒了。
    毛岸英学了两个星期，就学会了开荒、上粪、锄草、下种籽、耕地。吴满有说：“毛岸英和我们的变工队一样的会种庄稼了。”
