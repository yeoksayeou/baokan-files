    Random News from the Chiang Kai-shek Controlled Areas
    Overturned Train, Passengers Killed, Chiang's Officials Get Rich
    According to the "汴报" [Bian News]: On September 8th, a major train derailment occurred on the Longhai Railway, resulting in over 300 casualties. The train, which was traveling from Xin'an to Shanxian, derailed at the No. 12 Iron Bridge west of Jiaokou Station. The cause of the derailment was layers of corruption, which led to the long-term neglect and decay of the bridge, locomotives, and roadbeds. After the tragedy, the Kuomintang authorities sent police to guard the roads and search the victims' belongings, not allowing people to rescue the injured for a whole night, resulting in the deaths of the injured. Afterwards, the people of Henan Province requested the Chiang Central Government to send someone to investigate, but no action was taken. Now, the representatives of the deceased families, including Liu YanChu, have appealed to the Chiang Central Government for investigation and prosecution.
    
    According to reports from Beiping: At 6:00 PM on the 4th, an American jeep speeding at the intersection of Zhongshan Road and Yuwei Road in Tianjin knocked down a pedestrian named Chen Yongzhen, causing severe head injuries and extensive bleeding. He died in the hospital. The American vehicle that caused the accident "fled without a trace" amidst the police officers on the street.

    Thefts Rampant in Xi'an, Mayor Robbed Three Times
    Recently, theft cases have been rampant in Xi'an. Even the highly walled mansion of the Mayor has been robbed three times in a row. A thief named Wang Ying, disguised as a female student in late September, infiltrated the dormitory of the Xi'an Women's Normal School to commit theft, but was beaten to death. The security authorities are very troubled by the rampant theft. Imprisoning them would require too much prison food, so they have to release them after arresting them.

    A Beggar Sings Beethoven
    In Fuzhou, 42% of the 310,000 population are unemployed or jobless, resulting in a large number of beggars and thieves. Many mentally ill people have appeared on the streets, crying out about their grievances and behaving erratically. On An Tai Bridge, a young beggar sang Beethoven's songs loudly, showing that he was no ordinary beggar. At the foot of Ji Xiang Mountain, a man starved to death, and no one collected his body. The Provincial Medical College used it for dissection.
    
    Hengyang's Air is Foul, Often Smelling of Death
    According to the "沪侨声报" [Shanghai Overseas Chinese News] in Hengyang: the air is foul, often smelling of death.

    In the Jinghu (Nanjing-Shanghai) and Huhang (Shanghai-Hangzhou) railways, an average of 5,200 soldiers ride the train without tickets every day. At most, there are 7,100, accounting for one-tenth of all passengers. They even forcibly occupy reserved seats, causing disputes to occur at any time.

    More and more people are filing petitions on the streets of Hankou. There are six places on Jianghan Road, three on Yangzi Street, five on Old Paris Street, one on Nanjing Road, three at the railway station, and four on Minsheng Road, totaling 22 places. Those filing petitions are mostly unemployed soldiers and refugees.

    Luo, a rural woman from Nanxiong, Guangdong, was arrested by the Chiang government and detained in the county government's temporary salt warehouse for failing to pay grain. Luo took advantage of the guards' carelessness while entering the city and jumped into a well. She was already dead when she was pulled out.

    University Graduate Hangs Himself
    Sun Qinhe, a graduate of Shanghai Jiaotong University, hanged himself on the night of September 30th. According to a post-mortem investigation, his suicide was due to his inability to find a job and make a living.

    In the year since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, 19,963 criminal cases have occurred in Shanghai, an average of 50 cases per day, of which 12,273 were theft cases (accounting for 61%), an average of 33 cases per day.

    Guangzhou's "前锋晚报" [Pioneer Evening News] and "建国日报" [National Construction Daily] were ordered to suspend publication for one day each in early October by the Guangzhou Municipal Bureau for reprinting "疯癫庵语七章" [Seven Chapters of Mad Monk's Utterances], a supplement to the "南京新民报" [Nanjing New People's Daily], on the grounds of "attacking the government."

    The Shanghai Garrison Command recently banned reporters from entering for interviews. According to the guards of the command, "If a reporter is let in, you will be subjected to fifty military strokes." In early October, reporters from various newspapers jointly protested to the Garrison Command.

    One of the main reasons for the housing shortage in Nanjing and Shanghai is the forcible occupation of civilian houses by Chiang's party, government, and military officials. In late October alone, Tang Enbo received over 1,300 complaints from people in Shanghai about the forcible occupation of houses.

    According to a report in the Tianjin "益世报" [Yishi Daily] on September 17th, the mansion of the former Deputy Governor of the Puppet Central Reserve Bank, Qian Dahai, in Shanghai was as luxurious as a palace. When Tang Enbo went to Shanghai to "take over," he immediately "borrowed" it. At the beginning of the year, it was given to He Yingqin. When He Yingqin went abroad, it was given to Chen Cheng. When Chen Cheng left Shanghai in September, the mansion was handed over to the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration. Then, Chiang Kai-shek's second son, Colonel Chiang Wei-kuo, applied to the authorities for this mansion, saying that the ten-odd rooms of his original residence at No. 913 Juji Road were "insufficient."

    In August, a case was cracked in Shanghai. The principal offender, Zhu Yu, falsely claimed to be the General Director of the Southeast Special Envoy Office of the Military Commission and set up an office in Shanghai, divided into eight departments, selling official positions and titles. It cost 300,000 for a lieutenant, 500,000 for a field grade officer, and 3,000,000 for a railway station director. Commentators say this is a mirror of Chiang Kai-shek's warlord officialdom.

    "National Identity Cards" Cause Great Inconvenience to the People
    According to reports from Beiping: The police administration has recently been handling "National Identity Cards" in Beiping and Tianjin, causing great inconvenience to the citizens. According to the "Notification to Citizens for the Issuance of Identity Cards" announced by the police, not only are there dozens of items on the identity card, but also "Household Cards," "Population Cards," and "Fingerprint Cards," as well as two photos, and the person must go to the bureau in person, pressing all ten fingerprints (requiring three guarantors and two sureties, and if the cardholder commits a "crime," the guarantors must be jointly liable). It is also stipulated that each "Identity Card" costs 200 yuan, and the photo fee is 900 yuan per person. If you can't write, you have to pay 300 yuan for "writing fees." This move has aroused widespread dissatisfaction among the citizens of Beiping and Tianjin. A citizen wrote to a newspaper saying, "This is the greatest insult to the people and the greatest insult to our people and ancestors." A newspaper wrote an article saying, "This kind of joint bond of the Kuomintang is intended to deprive the people of their freedom guaranteed in the Provisional Constitution and to overturn the interpretation of criminal acts in the criminal law. Beiping, where the Chinese people live, is not a conquered area, nor is it an imperialist colony. Therefore, we have the right to refuse to accept this kind of insult to national personality."

    蒋区杂闻
    翻车乘客毙命  蒋家官员发财
    据汴报载：九月八日，陇海路曾发生死难三百余人的翻车大惨案，是日由新安开驶陕县之列车，行至交口站西十二号铁桥处翻车。翻车原因为层层贪污，以致桥梁机车路基均日久失修，早已朽坏。于惨案发生后，国民党当局派警严守路口，大肆搜寻遇难者的财物，至一夜之久，并不许人民前往救护，以致受伤者均相继死去。事后豫省人民要求蒋中央派人查勘，竟无下文。刻死难家属代表刘炎初等已向蒋中央吁请查办。
    北平讯：四日下午六时，天津中山路宇纬路口一美军吉普开行过速，将行人陈永珍碰倒后，脑受伤甚重，血溢满地，待送至医院已不治毙命。肇事美车当时即在满街岗警中“逃匿无踪”。
    西安偷盗如毛  市长被窃三次
    西安近来盗案纷起，围墙极高的市长老爷公馆，亦连续被窃三次。有小偷王英，九月下旬乔装女学生，潜入西安女子师范学校宿舍，行窃未遂，惨被殴毙。治安机关对偷盗如毛，甚为头痛，囚禁他们吧，又没有这么多囚粮，故只得随捕随放。
    乞丐引吭高歌悲多芬歌曲
    福州三十一万人口中，失业及无业者占百分之四十二，以致乞丐如毛，盗贼如毛。且市上出现许多神经失常的疯人，他们在大街上喊冤叫苦，哭笑无常。安泰桥上一年青乞丐，引吭高歌悲多芬歌曲，足见不是普通乞丐。吉祥山下一饿毙男尸，无人收埋，省立医学院以之作解剖之用。
    衡阳空气恶浊  时有死人气味
    衡阳街上沪侨声报载：空气恶浊、时有死人气味。
    京沪、沪杭两路火车中，非法无票乘车军人，平均每日共五千二百人，最多时七千一百人，占全部乘客的十分之一。彼等甚至强行占坐对号车，因此纠纷随时发生。
    汉口街头告地状者越来越多，计江汉路六处、扬子街三处、老巴黎街五处、南京路一处、车站三处、民生路四处、共达二十二处之多，告地状者，多系失业军人及难民。
    粤南雄乡妇罗氏，为欠缴粮谷被蒋政府拘捕于县府临时盐仓，罗氏乘入城时守兵不备，跳入井中，捞起时，业已毙命。
    大学毕业  悬梁自尽
    上海交通大学毕业生孙钦和，于九月三十日夜悬梁自尽，据事后调查，其自杀原因为找不到工作，无法生活。
    抗战胜利一年来，沪市发生刑事案达一万九千九百六十三件，平均每天发生五十件，其中盗窃案一万二千二百七十三件（占百分之六十一），平均每天达三十三件之多。
    广州之前锋晚报及建国日报，因转载南京新民报副刊《疯癫庵语七章》一文，均被广州会局以“攻击政府”罪名在十月初先后勒令停刊一天。
    上海警备司令部近禁止记者入内采访，据该部卫兵谈称：如果放了一个记者进来，就要挨五十下军棍。十月初各报记者特联名向警备司令部提出抗议。
    京沪房荒主要原因之一，即为蒋方党政军强占民房。仅十月下旬，汤恩伯赴沪即收到人民控诉强占房屋事件，一千三百余起。
    据九月十七日天津益世报载，前伪中储银行副总裁钱逆大槐在沪之巨宅一座，豪华如皇宫，汤恩伯到上海“接收”时，立予“借用”，年初让给何应钦，优间何应钦出国又让予陈诚，九月间陈诚离沪，该宅始交敌伪物产管理局。接着蒋介石的第二公子蒋纬国上校即向当局请领此巨宅，他原住的巨籍路九一三号住宅房间有十余间还“不敷应用”。
    八月间，沪市破获一案，主犯朱狱，冒名军委会东南特派员公署上将主任在沪设署，内分八大处，卖官送爵，活动一个尉官收费三十万，校官五十万，车站站长三百万，论者说这是蒋介石军阀官场的一面镜子。
    “国民身份证”扰民不堪
    北平讯：警管局，近在平津办理“国民身份证”，市民不堪其扰。据警局公布之“为颁发身份证告市民书”规定：不仅身份证项目多至数十项，并须连带“住户卡片”、“人口卡片”、“指纹卡片”等各一份，缴像片两张，还须本人亲赴局，押十指指纹（规定须有三人两保，如领证人犯“罪”，保人必须连坐）并规定“身份证”每份勒索二百元，照像费每人九百元，如不会写还须缴三百元“代书费”。此举引起平津市民普遍不满，市民投书某报说：“这是对人民最大侮辱，也是我国人民及乃祖乃宗的最大侮辱。”一报纸著文称：“国民党这种连结状，是欲剥夺约法中人民的自由保障，是推翻刑法中关于犯罪行为的解释。中国人民所住的北平不是被征服区，也不是帝国主义的殖民地，因此这种侮辱国民人格的事情，我们有权利拒绝接受。”
