    Taihang Second Prefecture Calls for
    Vigorous Development of Textile Industry in New Areas
    [Our Dispatch] The Taihang Second Prefecture, in order to fully organize the masses to engage in winter production, has specially published a winter production special issue to introduce and exchange production experiences from various regions. The special issue emphasizes that the old areas should focus on preventing complacency and the idea that "there are no problems." Leaders must sufficiently recognize that there will be many new situations and new problems in this winter's production, and they must promptly grasp and solve the obstacles to production. For the new areas, it is emphasized that winter production should be vigorously organized in areas where peasants owning their land has been initially realized. This is still a new issue in the new areas, and leaders must pay full attention to it. After the masses in the new areas have achieved great liberation and obtained land, they have the desire to further develop production and become wealthy, but they lack experience and confidence. Some also have ideological obstacles and difficulties. Therefore, first of all, it is necessary to publicize the Wu Manyou direction among the masses and carry out the two revolutionary ideological educations of "liberating and eradicating poverty, and basing production on wealth," and clearly establish the idea of becoming wealthy. Overcome the idea that some cadres have that "as long as the liberation is done well, everything will be fine" (which is basically correct), and relax leadership over production. Break the ideas such as "the Eighth Route Army loves the poor and takes pride in poverty," "labor is not as good as struggle, relying on struggle to eat," "afraid of leveling and not daring to become wealthy," and "winter idleness," and organize the masses to further invest the fruits of struggle into production. Secondly, strengthen economic leadership, pay attention to investigation and research, and overcome the blindness of production. Some villages in the old areas began production without a plan, doing whatever others do, and suffered a lot. We should help the masses study the specific situation and organize production. As for what to do, the principle is to do whatever they can, and do whatever they know. Vigorously developing the textile industry is still an important issue in the new areas. Furthermore, attention should be paid to solving specific difficulties. The new areas lack a production base, and there are difficulties in terms of raw materials, tools, and technology. Leaders should pay attention to organizing the masses to solve them. The new areas have received a lot of loans this year, which should be well managed. In short, it should be recognized that the transition from liberation to production is still an educational and organizational process. This year's winter production movement in the new areas is a prelude to the mass production movement next year.

    太行二专署号召
    大力开展新区纺织
    【本报讯】太行二专署为全力组织群众进行冬季生产，特出刊冬季生产专号，介绍交流各地生产经验。专刊中对老区今冬的生产提出着重防止轻松自满和认为“不成问题”的思想，领导上要足够认识今冬生产中，会有许多新情况新问题，要及时抓紧解决打破生产上的障碍。对新区强调提出，在初步实现耕者有其田的地区，应大力组织冬季生产，这在新区还是个新问题，领导上必须充分注意。新区群众在大翻身获得土地后，有进一步生产发家的要求，但缺乏经验和信心，有些也存在着思想的障碍和困难。因此，首先必须注意在群众中宣传吴满有方向，进行“翻身拔穷根、生产按富根”的两个革命思想教育，明确树立发家思想。克服部分干部存在着的“只要搞好翻身，一切不成问题”的想法（当然这基本上是对的），而放松对生产的领导。打破“八路军爱穷人、以穷为荣”，“劳动不如斗争、靠斗争吃饭”，“怕推平不敢发家”和“冬闲”等思想，组织群众进一步把斗争果实投入生产。其次加强经济领导，注意调查研究，克服生产的盲目性，老区有些村开始生产无计划，你搞啥我也搞啥，吃了很多亏。应帮助群众研究具体情况组织生产。至于干什么，原则上是能干啥干啥，会啥干啥，大力开展纺织，在新区恐还是个重要问题。再应注意解决具体困难，新区无生产基础，在原料、工具、技术方面都有困难，领导上应注意组织群众解决；新区今年贷款数目都不少，应很好掌握。总之应认识从翻身到生产还是个教育与组织过程，新区今年的冬季生产运动，是明年群众大生产运动的前奏。
