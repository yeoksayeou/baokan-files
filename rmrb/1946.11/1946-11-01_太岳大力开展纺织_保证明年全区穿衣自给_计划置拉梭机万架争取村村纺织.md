　　【Benbao Yangcheng Thirty Electric】In order to enrich the material basis of the patriotic self-defense war, the Taiyue Industry and Commerce Administration Bureau, the Jinnan Bank, the First and Fourth District Joint Cooperatives and its subordinate units, held a joint meeting in Yangcheng from the 4th of this month for 17 days. It was decided that the focus of future production work will be to launch a large-scale textile movement throughout the region to ensure self-sufficiency in clothing for the Party, government, army and people next year. The policy is to strive to achieve "every family spins cotton, every village weaves cloth." In the old liberated areas, the focus is on improving technology and quality, which requires advocating the mass manufacture and promotion of fly-shuttle looms. In the newly liberated areas along the Baijin Line, textile development should be focused on, and textile mutual assistance should be organized; along the Tongpu Line and in northern Henan, organizational leadership should be strengthened on the existing basis to carry out the textile movement. In order to complete the above tasks, it is planned to manufacture 10,000 fly-shuttle looms, and the district joint cooperative will convene women with textile experience from various villages to learn how to use them, and then return to the villages to teach other women. The bank has decided to issue production loans of 100 million yuan. The industrial and commercial departments have also decided to lend 150,000 jin of cotton. In order to reward women's textile work, it is stipulated that one jin of first-class thread will be given seven sheng of millet, and one jin of cloth will be given one dou to more than one dou of millet, in order to take into account the difference in technology between learning to weave and learning to spin. According to statistics, there are 38,700 women involved in textile work in Yangcheng, and 18,000 more can be added this winter, for a total of 56,700. Old textile workers can spin 4 jin of cotton per month, which is 774,400 jin in five months, and weave 387,000 pi of cloth. New textile workers can spin 2 jin of cotton per month, which is 180,000 jin in five months, and weave 90,000 pi of cloth, for a total of 477,000 pi of cloth. According to the county's population of 200,000, each person needs one to one and a half pi, for a total of 270,000 pi of cloth. In addition to self-use, there will be a surplus of 207,000 pi. If one pi of cloth sells for 2,000 yuan and one jin of cotton needs 400 yuan, after deducting the cost of more than 330,000 jin of cotton that still needs to be purchased due to insufficient cotton production, a net profit of 270 million yuan can be earned. If all cotton is self-sufficient, 414 million yuan can be earned.

　　Simin Fifth District Self-Planting, Self-Spinning, Self-Weaving, Self-Dyeing
　　[Another Dispatch] Since the masses in the Fifth District of Simin turned over this spring, their enthusiasm for production has been very high. In order to achieve self-planting, self-spinning, self-weaving, and self-wearing, they called on every family to plant cotton and indigo. Although cotton and indigo were somewhat damaged due to drought in the summer, the harvest can basically be self-sufficient with hard work; this district produced more than 3,500 jin of indigo this year. Now women are organized to spin and weave. Eleven administrative villages have opened dyehouses, which can dye an average of 165 zhang of blue cloth per day, which means that 19,800 zhang of cloth can be dyed in four winter months (September, October, November, December), enough for everyone to wear a blue suit. The masses believe that: what the government calls for is good, not only achieving self-planting, self-spinning, and self-weaving, but also achieving self-planting of indigo, self-making of indigo, and self-dyeing.

　　[Benbao Yangcheng News] Gaoping City, Southwest Kiln Village, the masses are actively engaged in production to get rich after turning over, and now the entire village has achieved "every family spinning and weaving." Since the establishment of the village's textile cooperative in October last year, all 93 households in the village have participated, and the capital has grown to 400,300 yuan. When the accounts were settled in the first month, 248 jin of cotton had been spun and 83 pi of cloth had been woven; when the accounts were settled in April, another 132 pi of cloth had been woven. The dividends received by the members exceeded twice the original share capital. Due to the huge profits, the number of members immediately increased to 162, the number of spinning wheels increased to 120, and the number of looms reached 5. This summer, another 108 pi of cloth were woven, and a total of 920 pi of cloth were woven in ten months. Spinning one jin of cotton earns five sheng of rice, and women are no longer discriminated against for being able to produce, and are extremely excited and happy. The wife of Liu Jingxin, the civil affairs assistant in the district, spins excellent thread, and her family relies entirely on her spinning and weaving for oil and salt, so her status in the family is also very high.

　　太岳大力开展纺织
    保证明年全区穿衣自给
    计划置拉梭机万架争取村村纺织
    【本报阳城三十日电】为充实爱国自卫战争的物质基础，太岳工商管理局、冀南银行、一、四两分区区联社及其所属单位，于本月四日起在阳城召开联席会议十七天，决定今后的生产工作重点为开展全区大规模的纺织运动，保证明年党政军民穿衣自给。方针是努力做到“家家纺花、村村织布”。在老解放区是提高技术与质量，为此需要提倡大量制造与推行使用拉梭机。在新解放区的白晋沿线，要有重点的发展纺织，组织纺织互助；同蒲沿线与豫北，则应在现有基础上加强组织领导，开展纺织运动。为完成上述任务计划制造拉梭机一万架，并由区联社召集各村有纺织经验的妇女，学会使用，回村教会其他妇女。银行则决定发放生产贷款一万万元。工商部门亦决定贷棉花十五万斤。为了奖励妇女纺织，规定纺头等线一斤给小米七升，织布一斤给小米一斗至一斗以上，以照顾学织比学纺费劲的技术差别。据统计阳城现有纺织妇女三万八千七百人，今冬还能增加一万八千人，共计五万六千七百人，老纺妇一月可纺花四斤，五个月计，可纺花七十七万四千斤，织布卅八万七千匹，新纺妇每月可纺二斤花五个月可纺十八万斤，织布九万匹，共计织布四十七万七千匹。按全县二十万人，每人一匹至一匹半计，共需用布廿七万匹，除自用外，还可余布二十万七千匹，以一匹布卖两千元，买棉花一斤需四百元计，扣除因产棉不敷穿用尚须买进之卅三万余斤棉花费用外，可净赚二万万七千余万元。如棉花全部自给则可赚洋四万万一千四百万元。
    士敏五区  自种自纺自织自染
    【又讯】士敏五区群众自今春翻身后，生产情绪很高。为作到自种自纺自织自穿，曾号召家家种棉种蓝，夏季虽因天旱，棉蓝有些受伤，但在勤劳努力下，收成基本上还可自给；本区今年打靛三千五百多斤。现妇女组织纺织。十一个行政村都开了染房，每天平均能染蓝布一百六十五丈，计冬四个月（九、十、十一、十二）即可染布一万九千八百丈，足够每人穿一身蓝衣服。群众认为：政府号召什么，什么好，不仅作到自种、自纺、自织，还能作到自己种蓝打靛自己染。
    【本报阳城讯】高平城，西南瓦窑村，群众翻身后积极生产发家，现已作到全村“家家纺织”。该村纺织合作社自去年十月创立以来，全村九十三户全都参加，资金已发展至四十万零三千元。正月结账时，已纺花二百四十八斤，织布八十三匹；在四月结账时，又织布一百三十二匹。社员分红超过原股金二倍。由于获利巨大，社员马上发展至一百六十二人，纺车增加到一百二十辆，织布机已达五架。今夏又织布一百零八匹，十个月共织布九百二十匹。纺一斤花赚五升米，妇女能生产不再被歧视，异常兴奋愉快。区民政助理员刘竞新之妻纺线极好，家里吃油盐全靠她纺织供给，因此在家庭地位也很高。
