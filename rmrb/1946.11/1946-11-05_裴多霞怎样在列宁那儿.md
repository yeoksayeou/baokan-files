　　How Pelageya Found Herself with Lenin

　　Our father was a roof-builder, working inside the Smolny Institute. He died just before the revolution was about to break out, leaving behind unpaid wages. The Provisional Government appeared, and my mother went to ask for the money. She returned shamefacedly, and everyone just asked:
　　"Old woman, did you see us jumping around freezing like toads?"

　　We were freezing in the winter. Mother said:
　　"Everyone is saying Lenin is good. I'll go to Smolny!"

　　One morning, when we woke up—old mother was gone. We thought she had gone to worship the gods, but she had gone to Smolny, imagine that! She wandered around many offices there and stumbled upon Lenin… He was writing, drinking cold tea, and eating candy…

　　She never thought that this was Lenin himself – there weren't many photos of him at the time – and asked:
　　"Sir, what kind of work do you manage? Do you handle paperwork? Or affairs?"

　　He laughed and said:
　　"I manage whatever comes my way, Madam. What's your business?"

　　"Everyone told me to come find Lenin. They said, Pelageya, this is your own affair. Among all the officials, only Lenin can handle your matter… But I saw you writing so fast, I thought: this gentleman must be very learned! – Right, isn’t this the highest official?… Where am I supposed to find Lenin, if you don't put yourself in my shoes?"

　　She sat down calmly and gave a brief report.

　　His eyes seemed to sparkle with joy, and he laughed loudly:
　　"That's right, Pelageya… it can be done without Lenin."

　　He called a colleague and tore a slip from a small notebook, giving it to him:
　　"Comrade, quickly take care of Pelageya's matter."

　　Mother returned home, taking out the money:
　　"All the officials in Smolny are good. They handled the matter without Lenin."

　　But a month later, she brought back a photo from the market.
　　"I bought a photo of an official. I even sat with him in the office…."

　　We looked, and we were shocked:
　　"Mama, this is Lenin!"

　　(This story was recorded on the Northern Railway in 1928.)

　　裴多霞怎样在列宁那儿
    我们的父亲是一个盖房顶的工人，他在斯莫乃里边做活。在革命将要起来的时候就死了，这样剩下的工钱没有领到手。临时政府出现了，母亲要钱去了，她羞惭惭的回来，大家只是问道：
    “老婆婆，你看见我们冻得像虾蟆似的在跳吗？”
    冬天我们挨着冻，母亲说：
    “现在都说列宁好，我到斯莫乃去一下吧！”
    有一天早上，我们一起来——老婆婆就不见了。我们想着她去敬神去了，可是她却到斯莫乃去了，你们想一想吧！她在那儿的许多办公室里转着，转着，就闯到列宁跟前了……他写着东西，喝着冷茶，吃着糖果………。
    她一点也没想到这就是列宁自己——那时像片不太多，——就问道：
    “先生，你管那一种事呢？管文案的呢？或是管事务的呢？”
    他笑了一声说：
    “有什么就管什么，太太。你有什么事？”
    “大家都叫我来找列宁的。都说，裴多霞，这是你自己的事情。所有官员中，只有列宁一个人能处理你的事……可是我看你写字写得这么样快，我就想道：这位先生一定很有学问的！——对了，难道这不是顶高的官吗？……我到那去找列宁呢，你不设身处地的替我想一想吗？”
    她平心静气的坐下，简短的报告了一下。
    他的眼睛真显得快活，大笑着说：
    “不错，裴多霞………不用列宁也能办到的。”
    叫来了一位同事，从小本子里撕了一个条子给他：
    “同志，赶快把裴多霞的事情办一办。”
    母亲回到家里，掏着钱：
    “斯莫乃的一切官都是好的，不用列宁都把事情办了。”
    可是过了一个月，她从市场上带回了一张照片。
    “我买了一位官员的照片，我就是同他在办公室里坐过呢……。”
   我们一瞧，都吃惊起来：
    “妈妈，这是列宁呵！”
