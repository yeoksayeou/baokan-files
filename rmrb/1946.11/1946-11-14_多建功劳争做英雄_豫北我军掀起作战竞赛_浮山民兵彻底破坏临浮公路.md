    Build More Merits, Strive to Be Heroes
    Our Army in Northern Henan Launches a Combat Competition
    Floating Mountain Militia Completely Destroys Linfu Highway
    [This newspaper's Changzhi, 12th dispatch] A wave of new heroic combat competition is sweeping through every unit, every company, platoon, squad, and every soldier of the Eighth Route Army on the front lines of Anyang and Tangyin in northern Henan. Both units and soldiers consider it an honor to undertake the most arduous and dangerous tasks in battle in order to build more merits. Whenever a combat mission arrives, several groups simultaneously request to take on the main attack direction. Every time a company instructor calls for volunteers to join the assault team, the soldiers in each company always sign up en masse, vying to go. They are striving for the glorious title of hero in the patriotic self-defense war. Shen Qibin, the eighth squad leader of the eighth company of the × regiment of the × unit, patted his chest several times in battle and said, "I am confident of becoming a combat hero who defeats Chiang Kai-shek." The terms of their squad-to-squad competition are to capture enemy machine guns on the battlefield. At a review meeting, the entire company unanimously requested to take on the main attack, otherwise they would not be able to exert their full strength. During the Zishui defense battle, in the battle to annihilate the second company of the 316th regiment of Chiang's 40th division in Yangquan Village, Guo Xiaosi, Feng Tingshuan, Zhao Huafu, Jiang Jinkui and dozens of other squad leaders and soldiers of the second company of the × regiment were determined to die when they accepted the order, and handed over their personal clothes and savings to the company headquarters. Before another battle, Zhao Youji, the artillery platoon leader of the × unit, handed over his entire savings of one thousand yuan to the public, expressing his determination to sacrifice himself for the self-defense war. Messengers on the front lines are very busy transmitting various challenge and response letters. The first company of the × regiment of the × unit challenged the eighth company to a long-term competition. Nan Mingqing, the second-class combat hero platoon leader of that company, wants to strive to become a first-class hero and challenge the old hero. The reconnaissance platoon of the × unit challenged the reconnaissance personnel of the ×× unit. Infantry and artillery challenged each other. Li Shuangxi, the head of the cooking squad of the × regiment's battalion headquarters, challenged the head of the cooking squad of the artillery company. They are all competing to complete their combat missions better. Political work and battlefield discipline are also part of their competition, such as the battlefield shouting competition between Guo Shisuo, the deputy squad leader of the first company of the × regiment of the × unit, and Zhao Guilan of the political work group. "Not violating mass discipline, not searching prisoners' pockets, and propagating self-defense and patriotism anytime and anywhere" are all their competition terms.
    [This newspaper's Taiyue, 12th dispatch] (Delayed arrival) The Floating Mountain militia, in conjunction with the masses, carried out large-scale sabotage, completely destroying the only retreat route of the besieged Chiang troops - the Linfu Highway. On the evening of the 16th of last month, hundreds of people in the first district, under the cover of the militia, completely destroyed all thirty-seven Chiang army bunkers in Xiaoguo and Baonan villages, completely uprooted more than twenty miles of telegraph poles on the Linfu Highway from Hanqi to the west section of Floating Mountain City, demolished the stone bridges of Zhao Zhuang and Xinzhuang, and the roadbed was also damaged, making it impossible to repair in the short term, and laid a minefield along the way. The Chiang troops entrenched in the southwest Paobei Village did not dare to attack, and told people in panic: The Eighth Route Army is destroying the road again. The next day, the Chiang troops in the city came out to reinforce, but the roadbed and bridges had been destroyed and could not advance. When the Chiang army officers saw slogans on the road saying "Oppose Chiang Kai-shek's selling out the country and the civil war," they angrily ordered the soldiers to remove them, but with a bang, a landmine suddenly exploded, killing three Chiang soldiers. The remaining Chiang soldiers fled in all directions and scurried back into the city.

    多建功劳争做英雄
    豫北我军掀起作战竞赛
    浮山民兵彻底破坏临浮公路
    【本报长治十二日电】新英雄主义的作战竞赛浪潮，洋溢在豫北安阳、汤阴前线八路军的每一部队、每一连、排、班和每一战士之间，无论部队和战士，均以在战斗中自己担任最艰苦、最危险的任务以便多建功劳为光荣。每当战斗任务到来，都同时会有好几部分要求担任主攻方向，每次连队指导员号召参加冲锋突击队时，每连战士们总是全体报名抢着要去，他们在爱国自卫的战争中争取着光荣的英雄头衔。×部队×团八连八班长申其斌在战斗中几次拍着胸膛说：“我有信心成为一个打败蒋介石的战斗英雄”。他们班与班的竞赛条件是要在战场上缴获敌人的机枪。该连在一次检讨会上，全体一致要求担任主攻，不然发挥不出力量。水冶自卫战中，在羊圈村歼灭蒋军四十师三一六团二连之役，×团二连于接受命令时，班长郭小四、冯廷拴，战士赵华府、蒋金魁等数十人，莫不抱必死的决心，把个人的衣服和积蓄都交给连部。另一次战斗前×部炮兵连排长赵有计把自己存有的一千元完全交公，表示自己要为自卫战争牺牲的决心。前线传令兵为传送各种挑战应战书十分紧张，×部队×团一连向八连挑战要作常期竞赛，该连二等战斗英雄排长南明清要争取一等英雄，向老英雄挑战。×部队侦察排向××部队侦察员挑战，步兵与炮兵的挑战，×团营部炊事班长李双喜与炮兵连炊事班长挑战，他们都为把自己的战斗任务完成得更好而竞赛。政治工作与战场纪律也是他们竞赛的内容，如×部队×团一连班副郭石锁与政工组赵贵兰的战场喊话竞赛，“不违犯群众纪律，不搜俘虏腰包，随时随地宣传自卫爱国”，都是他们的竞赛条件。
    【本报太岳十二日电】（迟到）浮山民兵结合群众，进行大破击，将被围蒋军的唯一退路——临浮公路彻底破坏。上月十六日晚间一区群众数百人，在民兵掩护下，将小郭、堡南两村三十七个蒋军碉堡悉数平毁，将临浮公路上韩畦至浮山城西段二十余里电杆完全拔除，折毁了赵庄、新庄两座石桥，路基亦被破坏，短期内无法修复，沿途摆下地雷阵。盘据西南庖杯村之蒋军，不敢出犯，恐慌地告人说：八路军又在破路了，次日，城内蒋军出城增援，可是路基桥梁均已破坏，无法前进。蒋军军官看见路上插有“反对蒋介石卖国内战”的标语，就愤恨地命令士兵拔掉，不料轰然一声，地雷突然爆炸，炸死蒋军三人，其余蒋军，四散逃命，窜回城内。
