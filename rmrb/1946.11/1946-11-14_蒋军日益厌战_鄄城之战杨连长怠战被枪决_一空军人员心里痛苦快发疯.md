    [Report from the Jilu-Yu Frontline Reporter Group, this newspaper, 12th] The Chiang army officers and soldiers' war-weariness is intensifying, creating a severe crisis for Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous civil war. Yang Lingqian, the company commander of the 1st Company of the 1st Battalion of the 86th Regiment of the 119th Brigade of the Chiang army, was executed by the regiment commander Zhang Runshan for leading his entire company of soldiers in refusing to serve as cannon fodder in the civil war. Zhang Gongxing, an adjutant of the regiment who laid down his arms, told reporters: Before departing from Heze, Yang Lingqian, the company commander of the 2nd Company, had feigned illness and requested to stay in Heze for recuperation, but was not approved by the regiment commander. When forced to depart, he repeatedly bid farewell to friends and entrusted them to take care of his family. When the regiment arrived at Fuzhuang, south of Juye, a battle broke out with the Eighth Route Army, and by dawn on the 31st, the 1st Battalion had lost more than half of its men. To salvage the desperate situation, the regiment commander specifically dispatched the 2nd Company to reinforce, but the morale of the company was low, and they were unwilling to fight their own compatriots. They reluctantly advanced halfway, then the entire company scattered and fled. The regiment commander found Company Commander Yang, publicly reprimanded him, and then raised his pistol and shot the company commander to death, saying that no one was allowed to collect his body. Adjutant Zhang added: "Although senior officers force their subordinates to charge in this way, the lower-ranking officers and soldiers are unwilling to risk their lives. The sacrifice of Company Commander Yang is just a tragic scene in Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous civil war." (Li Yi)
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th] According to a report from a special correspondent of the Chongqing Democratic Daily on September 29th from Xuzhou: A Kuomintang Air Force bombardier who fought for two years in the War of Resistance Against Japan, is only twenty-five years old this year. He has now been driven almost insane by this heinous civil war! His father is in Henan, working in the Liberated Areas, and his mother, younger siblings are all there. Yet, he himself is often ordered to bomb the people his family lives among. This young man, plagued by anxiety and insomnia, has aged to look like someone in his thirties or forties. He told the reporter sadly: "I'm really going crazy now. I love my father, I love my mother, and I especially miss my youngest sister. I'm afraid, I'm terrified. I'm afraid that one day I'll be sent to Henan to bomb the place where my family lives. In the past, when bombing the Japanese, I would quickly take pictures every time I dropped a bomb, and I was unspeakably happy when I saw it hit the target. But now, every time I drop a bomb, my hands tremble, and I'm even more afraid to take pictures. When I see it hit the target, it's all my own compatriots who are hit. I often imagine my father's bloody limbs at that moment." He hopes to withdraw from the war immediately and no longer do such inhuman things.

    蒋军日益厌战
    鄄城之战杨连长怠战被枪决
    一空军人员心里痛苦快发疯
    【本报冀鲁豫前线记者团十二日电】蒋军官兵厌战之风甚炽，已造成蒋介石卖国内战之严重危机。鄄城被歼蒋军一一九旅八十六团一营一连连长杨凌乾，因带领全连士兵拒绝充当内战炮灰，竟被该团团长张润珊枪决。放下武器之该团附员张共兴对记者称：二连连长杨凌乾由荷泽出发前，曾伪装病号请求留荷泽休养，但未得团长准许。被迫出发时屡与朋友话别，并嘱托代为照顾家属。该团开抵鄄城南傅庄时，即与八路军发生战斗，迄三十一日天明，一营已损失过半。团长为挽救危局，特调第二连前往增援，但该连军心焕散，都不愿打自己的同胞，勉强开抵半路，全连四散逃避，团长找到杨连长，当众斥骂后就举起手枪将连长击毙，并说不准收拾他的尸体。张附员又称：“虽然高级军官如此强迫下级冲锋，但下级官兵均不愿卖命，杨连长的牺牲，只是蒋介石卖国内战的一个悲惨影片而已。”（力以）
    【新华社延安十日电】据渝民主报特派记者九月二十九日自徐州报导称：有一个在对日战争中作战过两年的国民党空军轰炸手，今年只有二十五岁，现在已被这万恶的内战逼得他快要发疯了！他父亲在河南，是解放区的一个工作人员，他的母亲弟妹都在那里，而他自己却时常被命令去轰炸和他家人生活在一起的人们。这青年由焦虑失眠，已苍老得像一个三四十岁的人了。他沉痛地告诉记者：“我现在真要发狂了，我爱我父亲，我爱我母亲，更想我那最小的妹妹，我怕，我恐怖，我怕有一天派我去河南炸我家人所在的地方。过去炸日本人，每次投下弹都赶快照像，看见炸中了，说不出的高兴。但是现在每次投弹，手都在颤抖，更怕照像，看见炸中了，炸中的全是自己的同胞。我常常在那时幻想出是父亲血淋淋的肢体”。他盼望能即日退出战争，再不做那灭绝人性的事情。
