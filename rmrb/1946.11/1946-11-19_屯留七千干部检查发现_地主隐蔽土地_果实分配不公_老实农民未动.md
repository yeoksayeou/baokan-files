    Tunliu Seven Thousand Cadre Inspection Reveals:
    Landlords Concealing Land
    Unfair Distribution of Fruit
    Honest Peasants Untouched
    [This newspaper Yangcheng news] Since October 18, the first, second, third, and fourth districts of Tunliu, in order to implement the district party committee's instructions to realize "land to the tiller," successively convened a seven-day review conference of seven thousand cadres, activists, and liberated peasants. The Third District conference revealed that in some places the struggle had been incomplete, and landlords, both overtly and covertly, still retained much land and were constantly carrying out "counter-attacks." In many villages, the distribution of fruit was unfair, with the result that many poor peasants and those who were not assertive had not yet been liberated. Chen Xuesi from Dongwa Village stated that because he borrowed five yuan, he was exploited for five years by Peng Yuke, a local tyrant and usurer, who charged exorbitant interest. He was impoverished by the exploitation, but when the accounts were settled, he was only given two *shi* and five *dou* of grain, and he has not yet been liberated. Ji Huancheng of Liu Village said: "I have participated in the struggle for more than half a year, and I have only been allocated half a kilogram of salt, and I am as poor as before." An honest peasant from Yuli base point in the Second District also said: "Liberation, liberating one *sheng* is also liberation, liberating one *shi* is also liberation, we must overthrow the feudal forces!" The cadres also made profound self-criticisms of their own styles of being detached from the masses, such as forgetting the masses after they themselves had been liberated. They unanimously proposed that after returning to the village, they should lead the peasants to thoroughly investigate and defeat the hidden and remaining landlords, and adjust the fruits of the struggle, so that all peasants can obtain land and realize "land to the tiller."

    屯留七千干部检查发现
    地主隐蔽土地
    果实分配不公
    老实农民未动
    【本报阳城讯】自十月十八日起，屯留一、二、三、四区为执行区党委贯彻实现耕者有其田指示，先后召开了七千干部、积极分子和翻身农民的翻身检查大会，历时七天。三区会上除检查出有些地方由于斗争不彻底，地主明的暗的都还保有许多土地，且不断进行“反攻”活动，很多村庄的果实分配不公，以致许多贫苦及不啃气的农民尚未翻身。东洼村陈学司提出因借了五元钱，被村上恶霸高利贷者彭玉科大利盘剥了五年，被剥削穷了，算账时，却只给他算了两石五斗粮食，至今未得翻身。刘村姬焕成说：“我参加斗争半年多了，才分到一斤盐，还是和以前一样穷。”二区峪里基点一个老实农民也说：“翻身，翻一升也是翻身，翻一石也是翻身，总得把封建势力打垮才行！”干部们对自己翻了身忘了群众等脱离群众作风也作了深刻检讨，他们一致提出回村后要领导农民彻底清查打垮隐蔽及遗留地主，调剂斗争果实，使农民都获得土地，实现耕者有其田。
