　　Commemorating the First Anniversary of the Handan Uprising
　　Liu Xiuzhen
　　October 30th, this unforgettable day, has come again. A year has passed, and my personal ideological and behavioral changes during this year of great transformation have exceeded the progress of the past forty years, but I feel that it has passed particularly quickly.
　　I remember that on November 7th last year, I stepped into the Communist area, which had been described as so terrifying and dreadful for so many years. I quickly felt that this was another world! The first impression it gave me was that there was no heavy makeup, no rare delicacies, and no imported goods for the enjoyment of a special class to decorate the prosperity of the market. In the towns and markets I passed through, what I saw the most was food, agricultural tools, cotton cloth, and "earthy" local products. In the party, government, military, and civilian organizations in the areas I passed through, those working comrades who greeted us with diligence and enthusiasm, whether they were responsible officials or menial servants and soldiers, all wore cotton uniforms and ate simple meals. And the situation in the farmhouses I saw along the way was that they lived a life of men plowing and women weaving, with warm clothes and full stomachs, concerned about the future of peace and democracy in the country... In a word, the people here lived and worked in the same tense yet lively, diligent yet happy atmosphere, full of thriving and vibrant scenes everywhere. Compared with the atmosphere in the Kuomintang-controlled areas—on the one hand, it was a life of depression and decadence, unable to live, unable to die, and helpless; on the other hand, it was a life of extravagance, corruption, parasitism, corruption, and shamelessness—the incoordination made people feel suffocated, which made me excited and made me feel quick and happy even when I breathed, as if I had gained new vitality!
　　Whenever I saw the eight route army working comrades' big "mountain shoes" weighing two and a half pounds, I often asked myself: "What are these people doing?! Leaving their parents and families, abandoning personal enjoyment, working hard in wind and snow, are they all cold and ruthless?!" One day I asked a female comrade about her family situation, and in the conversation, I discovered that she was also full of love and affection for her family. However, normally, I never heard them talk about family issues on their own initiative. Gradually, I understood that deep in their hearts, there was an extremely fiery and rich enthusiasm burning, but they did not limit this emotion to the narrow scope of their personal families, but extended it to the liberation cause of the entire nation, the people, and mankind. I thought: "Worrying about the world's worries before the world worries, and enjoying the world's joys after the world enjoys," "Treating others' drowning as if one were drowning, and others' hunger as if one were hungry," and the unwavering will to be loyal to one's beliefs, these two kinds of education made these people sacrifice everything for themselves and dedicate themselves to the revolution, which is indeed an extraordinary feat. However, it is indeed only such a life that is the most meaningful, the most pleasant, and the most valuable—this thought lingered in my mind for a long time, it appealed to me, and has gradually enlightened me to have new views and new understandings on many issues, and new emotional changes have taken place!
　　When the news of the "April 8th" plane crash and the death of the martyrs reached my ears, it made me experience revolutionary emotions for the first time. Among the martyred heroes, besides Ye Ting and Wang Ruofei, whom I knew a little about, the rest of the martyrs, even their heroic names, I had never heard much about. To me, they were all extremely unfamiliar. However, I mourned this event for many days. At first, I subconsciously marveled at the changes in my emotions, but I immediately realized it, because I knew that they were all revolutionary pioneers who had fought for the liberation of the Chinese nation and the people of the whole country for one or twenty years, and today, they had dedicated their precious lives to the cause of independence, peace, and democracy for the Chinese nation and the Chinese people! At that time, I not only mourned their sacrifices, but also held a cursing heart. I cursed why the Kuomintang reactionaries did not die a few more to replace them?!—I had never had such emotions in the past, and it was impossible to have them. However, today it has changed, and it has changed so quickly and so naturally.
　　When the military dependents' school began to brew its establishment, I began to learn weaving, and when the dependents' school was established, we took production and learning as the guiding principle of the dependents' school's education. In the Kuomintang-controlled areas, I am afraid they would laugh at us for willingly being "lowly"! However, in the process of participating in more than a month of production and learning, this kind of collective labor, collective learning, and collective life made me and all of us gradually experience a new kind of emotion. When those rolls of cotton strips turned into strands of fine yarn in the whirring sound of the spinning wheel, and then the threads wound around the spindles were turned into handfuls of cotton yarn or synthetic cotton thread with a crank, when the results created by my own labor were presented in front of me, how lofty, joyful, and happy I felt at that time! From then on, I began to understand and experience how simple and precious the working people's feelings for labor are! Through this, my views on working people have changed in my concept. In the past, I used the humanistic point of view of compassion to look at them. Today, I have changed. The angle of view on this issue has indeed changed, and it has also become so fast and so natural!
　　It's been a year, and I have learned a lot. In my forty years of life, I have not learned so much, and I have not been so active. In this year of great change, I have changed, and I have changed so quickly, and my mood has become so positive. This change seems very strange, but there is nothing strange about it, because in this year of great change, all the officers and soldiers of our army and all the dependents of the army are changing in this torrent, and advancing in the change!
　　October 30th, this unforgettable day! Today, to commemorate your first anniversary, I have seen the progress of our army, and I commemorate you with infinite enthusiasm and joy. I hope that our army will always move forward with you without stopping! I also hope that all the dependents of the army will study hard, step up production, and strive for the liberation of women across the country and a new China of peace, democracy, and freedom.

　　纪念邯郸起义一周年
    刘秀珍
    十月三十日，这个让人永远忘不了的日子，又已来临。一年了，在这大变动的一年中，我个人思想行动上的变化，超过了四十年来的进程，但我却感到它过的特别快。
    记得去年十一月七日那一天，我踏进了多少年来被人们描述得那么恐怖、那么可惧的共产党地区——解放区。很快的我就感觉到了，这是另外的一个世界！首先给我的印象，这里没有浓装艳抹，没有山海奇珍，在这里找不到供特殊阶级享用的舶来品，来粉饰着市场的繁荣。经我经过的城镇集市里，使我看到最多的是食粮，农具，棉布、土头土脑”的土货。在我经过地区的党政军民各机关里，那些殷勤热忱招待着我们的工作同志，不论上自主管长官下至杂役兵夫都是一样，穿的是土布制服，吃的是粗茶淡饭，而我在沿途所见到的农家情形，他们过着男耕女织，暖衣饱食的生活，关心着国家和平民主的前途……一句话，这里的人们，都是处在同一的紧张而又活泼，勤劳而又愉快的气氛中生活着和工作着，处处充满着欣欣向荣，生气勃勃的景象。这和国民党统治区的那种——一面是消沉颓废，求生不得，求死不能，无可奈何的生活；一面是穷奢极侈，腐化寄生，贪污堕落，荒淫无耻的生活——不调协到使人气窒的气氛相比起来，使得我兴奋，使得我呼吸也都感到快畅，我好像得到了新的生命力似的！
    每当我看到八路军的工作同志那双二斤半重的大“山鞋”时，我常常自问：“这些人倒底是为了什么？！离开了父母家庭，抛弃了个人享受，在风霜雨雪中艰苦劳碌，是不是都是冷酷无情的？！”有一天我问到一位女同志的家庭情形，经言谈中，我发现了她对家庭也是一样充满了热爱和恋念。可是，在平时，我根本听不到她们自动的谈起家庭问题，逐渐地我理解了，在她们的心灵深处是燃烧着极其炽烈的、丰富的热情的，不过她们把这种情感不局限于个人的狭小的家庭范围内，而是扩及于全民族，人民和人类的解放事业上。我想：“先天下之忧而忧，后天下之乐而乐”“人溺己溺，人饥己饥”的精神，和忠于自己所信念事业的坚毅意志，这两种教养，使得这些人牺牲个人的一切，献身于革命，确是一件不平凡的事迹。然而，也确是只有这样的生活才是最有意义的，最愉快的，也是最有价值的——这个思想萦绕着我许久，它感召了我，因而已逐渐启发了我对许多问题有了新的看法，新的认识，发生了新的感情变化！
    当“四八”飞机失事，诸烈士遇难的噩耗传入我耳中时，使我初次的体验到了革命的情感，殉难诸烈士中，除叶挺、王若飞两烈士我约略还知道一些外，其余的烈士，连他们的英名我都未曾多听说过的，这对我说来，可都算是异常陌生的了，但是，我却为此事戚哀多日，起初，我下意识的惊讶我这感情的变化，但是，我也立即意识到了，因为我知道他们都是为中华民族与全国人民的解放而奋斗了一二十年的革命先进，而今天，他们为了中华民族与中国人民的独立、和平、民主事业而献出了他们宝贵的生命！当时，我不仅为他们的牺牲悲悼哀戚，而且我怀着一颗咀咒的心，我咀咒国民党反动派为什么不多死几个来代替他们？！——这种情感我过去是不曾有过，而且也不可能有的，然而，今天居然变化了，而且变化得这么快，而又这么自然。
    当本军眷属学校开始酝酿成立的时候，我就开始学习了纺织，及眷校成立，我们便以生产和学习作为眷校教育的方针，这在国民党统治区看来，恐怕要嗤笑我们是自甘“下贱”罢！可是，在参加了一个多月的生产和学习的过程中，这种集体的劳动，集体学习，集体生活，使我和我们全体都逐渐的体验了一种新的感情。当那一卷卷的棉花条在纺车的呜呜欢叫声中变成一缕缕的细纱，再把那绕满在锭子上的线丝，用拐子倒成一把一把的棉纱或合成棉线时，那种经亲手劳动创造出的成果呈现在我自己面前时，我当时的心情是多么的崇高、欣悦、而又多么愉快呵！我从此开始了解，开始体验到了：劳动人民对劳动的感情是多么的朴实，多么的珍贵呵！经此，我的观念里，对劳动人民的看法起了变化，过去，我是用悲天悯人的人道主义的观点来看他们的，今天，我是变了，在这个问题看的角度确是变了，而且，也是变得这么快和这么自然！
    一年了，我学到了不少的东西，在我的四十年的生活史上，我没有学到这么多，我也没有这样积极过。在这大变动的一年中，我是变了，而且变得这么快，我的心情变得这么积极，这种变化好像是很奇异的，但是这并没有什么可奇异，因为在这大变动的一年中，我们全军将士，全军眷属都是在这激流中变化，在变化中前进！
    十月三十日，这个永远让人忘不了的日子呵！今天，来纪念你第一个周年纪念，我看到了本军的进步，我以无限的热忱与快慰来纪念你，但愿本军将永远不停息的随着你前进！更愿全军眷属努力学习，加紧生产，为全国妇女的解放和平民主自由的新中国而奋斗。
