Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui Electric Report: In villages behind Yan's army occupied area of Wenshui, the masses are seizing the war gap to carry out the "Land to the Tiller" movement. From early September to mid-October, in one and a half months, according to incomplete statistics from 27 villages, a total of 2,827 peasant households recovered 8,715 mu of land. After Xiaoyi Town was recovered by the Eighth Route Army, the cadres immediately led the masses to settle accounts with traitors, puppets, and local bullies, and every poor mass in the village obtained two or three mu of land. A certain third village is only a few miles away from a Yan's puppet army stronghold, but the guerrillas and militia expelled the Yan's diehard "village administrators," and shielded the masses as they harvested in the daytime and settled accounts at night. Within five days, nearly a thousand mu of land was distributed to poor peasants. In the vicinity of these Yan's army strongholds, dozens of villagers, militiamen and masses established a joint self-defense system, first starting with organizing the masses to change labor and harvest autumn crops, and brewing settlement methods during labor. Once mature, they would convene a mass meeting to resolve the issues.

　　阎占区后方文水各村
    进行耕者有其田运动
    【新华社晋绥电】阎军占领区后方文水各村群众，抓紧战争空隙，进行耕者有其田运动。九月初至十月中旬一个半月内，据二十七村不完全统计，共有二千八百二十七户农民收回土地八千七百十五亩。孝义镇为八路军恢复后，干部即领导群众清算奸伪恶霸，全村贫苦群众每人获得土地二、三亩。某三村距阎伪军据点仅数里，游击队民兵则将阎顽“治村”人员驱逐出境，掩护群众白天秋收，晚上清算，五天之内有近千亩土地分配到贫苦农民手中。在此等阎军据点附近，数十村民兵群众建立自卫联防制度，先从组织群众变工秋收着手，在劳动时酝酿清算办法，待成熟后，即召开群众大会解决。
