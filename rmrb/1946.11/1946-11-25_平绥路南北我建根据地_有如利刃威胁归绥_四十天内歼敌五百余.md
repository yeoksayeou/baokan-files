Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 21st: Local guerrilla corps active in the rear of Fu Zuoyi's troops in Suiyuan and Mongolia, under the command of General Yao Zhe of the Eighth Route Army, who persisted in the anti-Japanese war in the Daqing Mountains for eight years, are galloping north and south of the Ping-Sui Railway and establishing guerrilla base areas with the local people, compressing Fu's troops into narrow transportation lines and several strongholds, becoming two sharp blades threatening Fu Zuoyi's base camp in Gui Sui from the north and south. In the Liangcheng and Helin areas of southern Suiyuan, only county towns and a few strongholds such as Tianjiazhen and Halayaozi are still occupied by Fu's troops, while the vast rural areas are still in the hands of the guerrillas. The Eighth Route Army cavalry has also advanced to the north of the Ping-Sui Railway, crushing the puppet Baojia organizations. From October to the beginning of this month, in forty days, the local corps guerrillas fought thirty-five battles with Fu's puppet troops, killing and wounding 242 enemy personnel at the column deputy level and below, capturing 280 personnel at the deputy regiment leader level and below, and seizing 213 long and short guns, one mortar, eight light machine guns, and 222 warhorses.

　　平绥路南北我建根据地
    有如利刃威胁归绥
    四十天内歼敌五百余
    【新华社晋绥二十一日电】活动于绥蒙傅军后方之地方游击兵团，在坚持大清山八年抗战的八路军姚哲将军指挥下，驰骋于平绥路南北与当地人民建立起游击根据地，将傅军压缩至狭窄交通线与若干据点内，成为南北袭击傅作义大本营归绥的两把利刃。绥南凉城、和林一带，只有县城及田家镇、哈拉窑子等几个据点尚为傅军盘据，而广大农村仍在游击队手中。八路军骑兵并挺进至平绥路北，粉碎伪保甲组织。十月至本月初四十天中，地方兵团游击队与傅伪军作战三十五次，毙伤敌纵队副以下二百四十二名，俘虏副团长以下二百八十名，缴获长短枪二百十三支，迫击炮一门，轻机枪八挺，战马二百二十二匹。
