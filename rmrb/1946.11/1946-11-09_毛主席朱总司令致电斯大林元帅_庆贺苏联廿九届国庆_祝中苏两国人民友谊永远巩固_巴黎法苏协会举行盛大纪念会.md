Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 6th: Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu sent a telegram to congratulate the October Revolution to His Excellency Marshal Stalin of the Soviet Union:

　　We respectfully congratulate your country on its 29th National Day. For 29 years, the Soviet Union has consistently sympathized with the cause of Chinese national independence and people's liberation. The Chinese people, starting with Mr. Sun Yat-sen, have also consistently sympathized with the Soviet Union's contribution to human peace and progress. We wish this friendship to be eternally consolidated!

　　Mao Zedong, Zhu De, November 6th.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 6th: Paris dispatch: The Franco-Soviet Association held a grand meeting here at the Salle de la Mutualité on the 5th to commemorate the 29th anniversary of the Soviet October Revolution. Approximately 5,000 representatives attended. Soviet Ambassador to France Bogomolov, Vice President of the French Council of Ministers Thorez (leader of the French Communist Party), Secretary-General of the World Federation of Trade Unions Saillant, and many cultural figures were elected to the presidium. In his opening speech, Saillant emphasized "the great historical significance of the October Revolution." He said: "Today, the Soviet Union is a powerful and peaceful country. Reactionaries are spreading rumors about the Soviet Union, but the whole world knows that it was the Soviet representative who first advocated disarmament. Just as victory would not have been possible without the Soviet Union, peace is also impossible without the Soviet Union." Saillant concluded with a passionate call to consolidate Franco-Soviet friendship.
