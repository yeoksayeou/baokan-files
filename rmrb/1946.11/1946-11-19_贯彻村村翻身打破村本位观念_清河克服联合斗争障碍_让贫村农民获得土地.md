    Implement Village-by-Village Turnaround, Break Down Village-Based Mentality
    Qinghe Overcomes Obstacles to Joint Struggle
    Allowing Poor Village Peasants to Obtain Land
    [Our newspaper, Weixian, 15th dispatch] Qinghe has achieved considerable success and experience in solving the land problems of poor village peasants through joint struggle, completely eliminating extreme poverty. Villages with excessive wealth disparity can conduct joint struggles to redistribute the gains. However, the masses in wealthy villages are often dissatisfied, thus creating contradictions between poor and wealthy villages. For example, Yincai Village (wealthy village) and Huayuan Village (poor village) in the Third District are a joint unit. After initially agreeing to the union, Yincai Village suddenly disagreed, repeating this process several times. Before the joint struggle between the Front and Rear Wu Villages, the Rear Wu Village wanted the Front Village to participate, but the Front Wu Village cadres said, "We're not going! It's not worth it to join!" They also said, "The masses don't agree." Ge Maizhuang and Bei Jia Village argued at the joint struggle meeting. In the Fifth District, Wu Tang and Bai Zhu Village were initially united very well, but due to sabotage by destructive elements, over a thousand people from both sides had misunderstandings, almost leading to a fight. The reason for these phenomena is that wealthy villages lack understanding of joint struggle and have a village-based mentality. Some wealthy villages believe that the belongings of those being struggled against were only plundered from their own village, and other villages should not share them. Some wealthy villages look down on poor villages, acting arrogantly; some cadres in wealthy villages fear that their own villagers will say they are incompetent for allowing others to share their things; but there are also a few poor villages where the masses are relatively strong, so they go to wealthy villages and take things without asking. There are also individual villages that believe the fruits of joint struggle with large villages are gifts from the large villages, without realizing their own strength. To organize joint struggles, leaders must solve the above-mentioned basic ideological problems. First, at the district and village cadre conferences where work is being arranged, the rationale for joint struggle and unified distribution of fruits must be emphasized and explained. The Fifth District specifically held a day-and-a-half discussion on this issue, and finally everyone's thinking was unified. Wealthy village cadres all swore to resolutely turn over with the poor village peasants and share the fruits together. The Third District also emphasized this issue, launching debates in small groups to unify thinking. After the Ge Maizhuang conference, the First District cadres immediately summoned the wealthy village branch secretaries for talks, and also educated the village cadres, followed by educating the activists. After their thinking was unified, they were sent to unify the thinking of the masses. Finally, a mass meeting was held, calling for the organization of a joint struggle committee for poor and wealthy villages, so that joint struggle could be smoothly realized. When explaining the significance of joint struggle and conducting ideological education, each village discussed the following issues: First, poor people all over the world are one family, united to eliminate feudal exploitation. Second, landlords not only exploit their own villages, but also exploit other villages. For example, Wang Hanlin of Gao Pei, who was an official in Sichuan for seven years, returned and acquired more than ten hectares of land, which was the blood and sweat of the people of Sichuan. The boundaries of the Wang Guanzhuang landlord's land extended to the north and south of houses in other villages, which can explain how poor villages became poor. Starting silver shops, lending at usurious rates, and getting rich through trickery can all illustrate the broad scope of landlord exploitation and plunder. Third, the turnaround of one village does not count as a turnaround; only the turnaround of every village counts as a turnaround. After their thinking was unified, the farmers' association members of Hou Shi Dian said: "The turnaround of one village is useless, a single tree cannot make a forest; one wall cannot block the wind from all directions, can one village block Chiang Kai-shek when he comes?" After the struggle, the main village (wealthy village) should be taken care of in the joint distribution of fruits. For example, the Third District Village Cadre Conference resolved that land should be distributed uniformly, and miscellaneous items should be distributed more to the main village. After stipulating the land distribution standards for eliminating extreme poverty, the Front and Rear Duan Villages in the First District also determined the distribution ratio based on the number of poor farmers in the famous villages, and then divided the fruits according to the villages, and each village then discussed and distributed them according to its own situation. The entire process of joint struggle must be permeated with thorough ideological education, because problems are constantly arising. Even after the struggle, constant attention is needed. The handling of provocateurs in joint struggles should be cautious, and the targets should be clearly distinguished. Some of these people are spies, some are people who have been struggled against, some are running dogs, and some are masses who have not had their thinking unified, and they should not all be attacked.

    贯彻村村翻身打破村本位观念
    清河克服联合斗争障碍
    让贫村农民获得土地
    【本报威县十五日电】清河以联合斗争解决穷村农民土地问题，彻底消灭赤贫，已取得不少成绩与经验。贫富悬殊过甚的村可以进行联合斗争，调剂果实。但富村群众往往不满，因此产生贫富村的矛盾。如三区尹才庄（富村）与花园村（穷村）是一个联合单位。尹才庄同意联合之后，忽而又不同意了，曾反复多次。前、后吴庄进行联合斗争前，后吴庄要前庄去参加，前吴庄村干说：“俺不去！联合了不够本！”又说：“群众不同意。”葛埋庄与被家庄在联合斗争会上吵起架来。五区无堂，白住庄本来联合得很好，但因有破坏分子捣鬼，双方一千多群众起了误会，几乎打起架来。产生这些现象的原因，多是富村对联合斗争不认识，存在着村本位思想。有些富村认为被斗争户的东西仅是从本村掠夺来的，别村不应该分。有的富村看不起穷村，自高自大；部分富村的干部怕本村群众说自己无能，让别人分了东西；但也有少数穷村由于群众力量较强，到富村不由得说，把东西分了就走。还有个别村庄以为得到与大村联合斗争的果实是大村恩赐，没认识到自己力量。领导上要组织联合斗争，就必须解决以上这些较为基本的思想问题。首先在布置工作的各区村干部大会上强调说明联合斗争与统一分配果实的道理。五区为这个问题，专门作了一天半讨论，最后大家思想都打通了。富村干部都宣了誓，坚决与贫村农民一道翻身，同分果实。三区也强调了这个问题，在小组里展开争论，打通了思想。一区区干部在葛埋庄大会结束后，即召集富村支部书记谈话，并对村干部进行教育，接着又对积极分子进行教育。思想打通后，又由他们去打通群众思想。最后开群众会，号召组织贫富村联合斗争委员会。使联合斗争顺利实现。在说通联合斗争的意义及进行思想教育时，各村都讨论了如下问题：第一、天下穷人是一家，联合起来消灭封建剥削。第二、地主不只剥削本村，而且剥削外村。如高裴的王翰林，在四川坐了七年官，回来置了十几顷地，这是四川人民的血汗。王官庄地主的地边一直伸到外村的家南家北，这可以说明穷村是怎样穷的。开银号、放高利贷、刀笔发家等，都可说明地主剥削掠夺的范围非常广。第三、一个村翻身不算翻身，必须村村翻身才算翻身。后食店的农会员在打通思想后说：“一个村翻身不顶事，孤树不成林；一面墙挡不住八面风，老蒋来了你一村能挡住？”斗争过后，在联合分配果实中，对主村（富村）要加以照顾。如三区村干会上决议，土地统一分配，杂物多分给主村。一区前后段庄在规定消灭赤贫的土地分配标准后，又以名村贫农人口多少为标准，确定分配比例，然后把果实按村分开，各村再按自己村的情形评议分配。联合斗争的整个过程，必须贯彻深入的思想教育。因为问题是不断发生的。即在斗争以后，也须经常注意。处理联合斗争中的挑拨者要慎重，要分清对象。这些人中有的是特务，有的是被斗争户，有的是走狗，也有的是没有打通思想的群众，不应一律打击。
