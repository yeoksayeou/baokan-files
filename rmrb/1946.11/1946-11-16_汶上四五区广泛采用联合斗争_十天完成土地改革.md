    Wenshang Fourth and Fifth Districts Widely Adopt Joint Struggle
    Ten Days to Complete Land Reform
    Number of Women Farmer Members Soars During the Movement
    Farmers Hold a Congress to Celebrate the Return of Land to Its Owners
    [Report from this newspaper, Ji Lu Yu Front] The land reform movement in the Fourth and Fifth Districts of Wenshang, after ten days of intense work, has fully realized "land to the tiller." The land reform movement in the Fourth District began on September 19th. They started with villages that were easier to work with, and then attacked backward villages; and widely adopted the method of joint struggle, combining villages with poorer work performance with villages whose cadres had weaker abilities, to carry out joint struggle and reason with the landlords. The land recovered was also managed by the land resolution committee jointly established by each village, and distributed jointly. For example, in the Zhangxinzhuang sub-district, more than twenty local tyrants and landlords were divided into three struggle sessions and finished in one day. In this way, the scale was grand, the masses' enthusiasm was extremely high, and the landlords could not quibble; at the same time, it avoided sham struggles and brought along backward villages. Therefore, the entire district only took ten days, and some sub-districts only took seven days, to resolve the land problem for all farmers in the district. A total of 11,468 mu of land were returned to the farmers, benefiting 4,661 households and 22,576 people in the district, accounting for 43 percent of the households and 40 percent of the population in the district. After the farmers got the land, everyone was extremely excited, so more than 10,000 liberated farmers in the district held a congress to celebrate the return of land to its owners. The Fifth District started relatively late. They started after the district cadre meeting on October 1st. By the 10th, most of the land problems in the district had been resolved, with only a few small villages yet to be resolved. According to incomplete statistics, the Southeast sub-district alone returned 3,500 mu of land to the desperately poor and poor farmers. Each person in Zhengcheng Village now has an average of more than four small mu of land, and each person in Su Village also has almost three mu. In solving the land problem, the majority of the masses were organized, and the number of members in the district increased by one-half, and women's associations were also generally established. Zhengcheng Village has a total of 300 households. Except for eight landlord and rich peasant families, all the rest participated in the farmers' and women's association organizations. Currently, the village has a total of 290 farmer members and 210 women's association members. Su Village has only 50 households, and 34 households have their entire families in the association. After this land reform, nearly 100,000 farmers in the Fourth and Fifth Districts of Wenshang each have their own land to cultivate.

    汶上四五区广泛采用联合斗争
    十天完成土地改革
    运动中农妇会员人数激增
    农民召开大会庆祝土地还家
    【本报冀鲁豫讯】汶上四、五两区的土地改革运动，经过十天的紧张工作，已全部实现了耕者有其田。四区的土地改革运动，从九月十九日开始进行，他们先从好作的村下手，然后再去突击落后村；并大量采用了联合斗争的方式，把工作比较差的村与村干能力弱的村联合在一起，进行联合斗争讲理，收回的土地，也由各村共同成立的土地解决委员会负责，共同分配。如张辛庄小区，把二十多个恶霸地主，分成三个斗争场，一天就斗完了。这样，规模盛大，群众情绪极高，地主也就无法狡辩；同时，也避免了假斗争，带起了落后村。因此，全区只用了十天工夫，有的小区只用了七天，就解决了全区农民的土地问题。共归还给农民土地一万一千四百六十八亩，使全区有四千六百六十一户，二万二千五百七十六口人得到土地，占全区户数的百分之四十三，全区人口的百分之四十。农民得到土地后，大家异常兴奋，于是，全区一万多翻身的农民开了个大会，庆祝土地还家。五区开始的比较晚，他们于十月一日开完区干会后，才着手进行，到十日止，全区的土地问题也大部都解决了，只有个别小村尚未解决。据不完全统计，仅东南小区即以土地三千五百亩归还给赤贫及贫农。郑城村每人已平均有四小亩以上的地，苏村每人也差不多有三亩。在解决土地问题中，多数群众都组织起来了，全区会员增加了二分之一，妇会也普遍的建立起来。郑城村共三百户，除八家地主富农外，都参加了农妇会组织，现该村农会员共二百九十名，妇会会员二百一十名。苏村只有五十户，就有卅四户全家都在会的。经过这次土地改革，汶上四、五两个区，将近十万农民，每个人自己都有地种了。
