[Report from our newspaper in Wei County on the 2nd] The Sixth District of En County has initially realized "land to the tiller" and has now moved into the stage of clearing the fruits of victory, reorganizing organizations, and conducting a land reform review. According to a ten-day investigation, the phenomenon of wasting the fruits of victory in various villages is extremely serious. In Sanchang Temple Village alone, over 100,800 yuan was wasted on buying belts for children. In addition to the excessive spending by village cadres on dining and entertainment during market trips and excessive funeral expenses, and the excessive extraction of the fruits of victory for buying guns for the militia, over 700,000 yuan of the fruits of victory have already been spent. In Dachuzhuang, there are often fourteen or fifteen cadres and militiamen eating collectively. After a struggle, 3,200 jin of wheat and 4,598 jin of millet have already been consumed. The entire village has 102 poor people, each of whom received only six to eight jin of grain. In some villages, the fruits of struggle have not yet been distributed because: 1. Some cadres privately borrowed the fruits of victory and delayed distribution, such as a Yantai Village cadre who borrowed over 90,000 yuan; 2. Landlords fantasize about a "change of regime" and deliberately delay handing over the fruits, and village cadres have not made efforts to pursue them. After these problems were discovered, the masses advocated immediately pursuing the handover, and if there were excuses that items could not be sold, then the actual items should be pursued and priced on the spot for distribution. Currently, the leadership in En County is guiding village cadres and the masses to make corrections. Furthermore, a report states: In order to avoid wasting the fruits of struggle, the Sixth District of Xiajin, based on the opinions of over 90% of farmers, decided to buy grain with the cash and distribute it, and established a public pledge that all farmer members have the right to investigate and punish. This allows the masses to receive the fruits of victory and avoid the occurrence of waste.

　　恩县六区翻身大检查中
    发现各村严重浪费果实
    【本报威县二日电】恩县六区初步实现了耕者有其田，现已转入清理果实，整理组织，进行翻身大检查。根据十天检查，各村浪费果实现象异常严重，仅三教堂村给儿童买皮带就浪费十万零八百余元，加上村干上集大吃大花和殡葬用费过多，民兵买枪提果实太多，果实已花去七十万元以上。大储庄经常有十四五个干部和民兵集体吃饭，斗争结果后麦子已吃了三二○○斤，谷子四五九八斤，全村一百零二个贫民，每人仅分得六斤至八斤的粮食。有些村庄斗争果实至今尚未分配，原因是：一，有些干部私借果实，拖延不分，如烟台村干部借了九万余元；二，地主幻想“变天”，故意拖延不交，村干亦未抓紧追索。这些问题发现后，群众主张马上进行追交，如有借口卖不出东西者，则追交现物，当场作价分配。现恩县领导上正引导村干及群众进行纠正。又讯：夏津六区为避免斗争果实的浪费，根据百分之九十以上农民的意见，决定把现款买成粮食分配，并订立公约，各农会员都有缉查权利，这样使群众既分到了果实，又免除了浪费现象的发生。
