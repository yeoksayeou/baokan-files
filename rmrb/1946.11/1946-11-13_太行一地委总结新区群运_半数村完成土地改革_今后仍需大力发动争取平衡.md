    Taihang First Prefectural Committee Summarizes Mass Movement in New Districts;
    Half of Villages Complete Land Reform;
    Continued Vigorous Mobilization Needed to Achieve Balance
    [This newspaper reports] The Taihang First Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently summarized the mass movement in the new districts since August. The summary first pointed out that among the 929 administrative villages in the eight new districts (Yuan, Jing, Lin, Nei, Zan, Gao, Sha, and Xing) 550,000 peasants have been involved in the movement, and 500,000 mu of land have been recovered (according to estimates from three counties, this number accounts for about one-quarter of the total land area of the new districts). The vast number of cadres and peasants are highly enthusiastic under the encouragement of the policy of "land to the tiller." Therefore, the scale and depth of the movement, based on the situation of only one and a half months (August to mid-September), has far exceeded the achievements of the past few months. In the past, during the anti-traitor stage, the middle peasants were active, but this time the poor peasants, tenant farmers, and middle peasants were all involved in the movement, and many leading backbones were cultivated among the poorest masses. According to statistics from fifteen villages in seven counties (excluding Neiqiu): Before liberation, the landlords' land was more than 1,800 mu. After the counter-attack and liquidation of traitors, it was reduced to 780 mu by July (a reduction of 57% compared to the original land). From July to the time of the summary, it was reduced to 147 mu (a reduction of 82% compared to July). The change in the number of middle peasant households is: before liberation, there were a total of 1,116 middle peasant households. After the counter-attack and liquidation of traitors until July, it increased to 1,617 households. From July to the time of the summary, it increased to 2,296 households. Before liberation, poor peasants and hired laborers had an average of one to two mu of land per person. After the counter-attack and liquidation of traitors until July, it increased to two to three mu. Now, at the time of the summary, it has increased to three to four mu. The summary used "Three Heavens and Three Earths" – "Earth-shattering," "World-overturning," and "Joyful" – to describe the momentum of the movement. "Land to the tiller" has been initially realized, and the face of the countryside has been completely changed. The summary then pointed out that the development of the movement started with mobilizing all cadres, clarifying the idea of "land to the tiller," and breaking down complacency. However, different approaches were adopted in different regions: The first approach was used in areas where the anti-traitor liquidation was relatively successful. It started with reviewing the emancipation process to break down the complacency of cadres. After vigorously publicizing the new policy, the liquidation of landlords was launched again. The second approach was used in areas where more problems were left over after the anti-traitor liquidation. This mainly involved two situations: First, the despotic landlords sent lackeys disguised as leaders to seize leadership positions, oppress the masses in various ways, and provoke relations between leaders and the masses. Second, cadres were corrupt and embezzled the fruits of victory, lived a decadent and wasteful life, and seriously alienated themselves from the masses. The nature of these two types of problems is different, but in handling them, it is necessary to start by solving the problems of the cadres and then turn to further in-depth struggle (if cadre corruption is too difficult to handle, do not get entangled; solve a part and then let go). The third approach was used in areas that had not yet been mobilized. After publicizing the Party's land reform policy, a general liquidation was carried out. The summary particularly pointed out that through this period of movement, the mass line of leadership has become more profound for us. When the movement started, we were still adhering to the old methods of leading rent reduction and interest reduction in 1942 and 1944 (first enlighten ideological awareness, and then slowly lead the masses to action). However, when the masses had clarified the Party's land reform policy and acted, they broke through our baggage of empiricism. At this time, whoever can grasp the enthusiasm of the masses and work hard will truly follow the mass line, and the movement will proceed faster and more thoroughly. Secondly, the movement also educated us that the practice of "only burying oneself in leading emancipation and ignoring the changes in the overall situation" is wrong. The Central Bureau's call for mobilizing the patriotic self-defense war was not seriously conveyed and discussed. The masses had concerns about the idea of a change of regime, and they did not seize the opportunity to give a clear direction. The emancipation struggle in the border areas suffered some unnecessary losses, which were all related to this idea, and attention should be paid to it in the future. The summary finally pointed out that the current development of the movement is: villages where the land problem has been completely resolved account for about 45%, those that are solving the land problem account for 50%, and villages where the problem has not yet been resolved account for 5%. The general situation is that there are more general villages. Therefore, in the next month, we must vigorously mobilize, strive for balance, and solve the more complicated problems in general villages, which are entangled with cadre problems, very carefully and forcefully. Secondly, we should pay attention to mobilizing the masses in the border areas. The experience gained in this stage is to protect emancipation with armed forces (for example, in the beginning, Gaoyi Third District did not pay attention to armed forces, and the masses suffered losses. Only after forming small guerrilla regiments and conducting activities did the emancipation movement begin again) and combine it with anti-traitor work. On the one hand, conduct armed guerrilla activities, and on the other hand, seize the gaps to carry out emancipation. The leadership should pay special attention to current affairs education. The closer to the enemy area, the more urgent the masses' demands in this regard. Furthermore, we should rectify various organizations, especially the militia. In the past, due to the lack of depth in the movement, many bad elements infiltrated, and it is very dangerous if they are not cleared out. The experience of Gaoyi is: do not use the viewpoint of solely focusing on class composition as the only standard for rectifying the militia organization, as this cannot completely eliminate bad people. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct a comprehensive examination of each person's historical social relations and their performance in the movement. Finally, we should strengthen the construction of new district branches to ensure that the Party can play a core role in various movements.

    太行一地委总结新区群运
    半数村完成土地改革
    今后仍需大力发动争取平衡
    【本报讯】中共太行一地委顷总结八月份以来新区群运。总结中首先指出：新区八县（元、井、临、内、赞、高、沙、邢）九百廿九个行政村中已有五十五万农民卷入运动，收回土地五十万亩（据三个县的估计，此数约占新区土地总面积的四分之一）。广大干部农民在耕者有其田的方针鼓舞下热情极高，因而运动的规模与深度仅以一个半月（八月到九月半）的情况看，即已远远超过已往数月成绩。过去在反奸阶段中，中农活跃，而此次贫佃雇农及中农则全部卷入运动，并在最贫苦的群众中培养了许多领导骨干。据七个县十五村的统计（内邱除外）：地主土地在解放前为一千八百余亩，经反攻后的反奸清算到七月止，减至七百八十余亩（与原有地比较削弱百分之五十七），七月以后到总结时减至一百四十七亩（与七月份比较削弱百分之八十二）。中农户数的变化是：解放前共有中农一千一百一十六户，反攻后到七月间的反奸清算中增至一千六百一十七户，七月后到总结时，增至二千二百九十六户。贫雇农土地在解放前平均每人一亩到二亩，反攻后到七月的反奸清算中增加为二亩到三亩，现在当总结时即已增加到三亩到四亩。总结中以三天三地——惊天动地、翻天覆地、欢天喜地来比喻此次运动的声势。耕者有其田已初步实现，农村面目已完全改观。总结中继即指出：运动的开展是从动员全体干部，明确耕者有其田思想，打破自满情绪入手的。但在不同地区采取了不同入手方法：第一种是反奸清算做得比较好的地区从检查翻身入手，打破干部自满情绪，大力宣传新方针后，再次发动对地主的清算。第二种是经过反奸清算后遗留问题较多的地区，这基本上有两种情况：一是恶霸地主派遣狗腿伪装打入掌握领导地位，多方欺压群众，挑拨领导与群众关系。二是干部贪污果实，生活腐化浪费，严重脱离群众者。两类问题性质不同，但在处理上则必须是先从解决干部问题入手，而后转入继续深入斗争（干部贪污太棘手的不被纠缠，解决一部分即要放手转）。第三种是尚未发动过的地区，则经过宣传党的土地改革方针后进行总清算。总结中特别指出：经过这一段运动，群众路线的领导方法，对我们是更加深刻了。当运动开始时，我们还拘泥于四二年四四年领导减租减息的一套老方法（先启发思想觉悟，再慢慢领导群众行动），但当群众已明确了党的土地改革方针而行动起来的时候，就把我们这个经验主义的包袱冲破了，此时谁能掌握群众大干热情大干起来，谁就真正走了群众路线，运动也就进行较快较彻底。其次是运动中还教育了我们“只埋头领导翻身，不顾整个大局的变动”的作法是错误的。中央局的爱国自卫战争动员号召没有认真传达讨论，群众中有变天思想的顾虑，没有抓紧给以明确方向，边地的翻身斗争受到了一些不应有的损失，都与这个思想有关系，今后仍应加以注意。总结中最后指出：目前运动发展的情形是：土地问题已彻底解决的村庄约占百分之四十五，正在解决土地问题的占百分之五十，尚未解决问题的村庄有百分之五。总的情况是一般村较多，因此在今后一个月内还须大力发动，争取平衡，一般村庄问题较复杂，有干部问题纠缠，要很仔细的用力解决。其次是注意边地群众发动，这一段已取得的经验是以武装保卫翻身（如高邑三区起初不注意武装，群众吃亏了，组成小游击兵团活动后，才又开展了翻身运动）并与反奸结合进行。一面武装游击活动，一面抓紧空隙进行翻身。领导上应特别注意时事教育，越靠近敌人地区，群众在这方面的要求越迫切。再就是整顿各种组织，特别是民兵，过去一段因运动不深入，不少坏分子潜入，不清理很危险。高邑的经验是：不要用唯成分的观点来做为整顿民兵组织唯一标准，这样并不能完全清除坏人。因此就必须从每个人的历史社会关系与参加运动的表现来做全部考查。最后是加强新区支部建设，以保证党能在各种运动中起核心作用。
