    The fate of the First Battalion artillery company of Chiang Kai-shek's Tenth Artillery Regiment of the Ministry of Defense was the same as that of Liu Ruzhen's troops during the Battle of Juancheng – annihilation. All eight howitzers, twenty-four vehicles, and all American equipment were seized by the Eighth Route Army.

    (I)

    Through Chiang Kai-shek's meticulous efforts, the "Tenth Artillery Regiment" had been in existence for ten years, originally equipped with German-made "105MM" howitzers. This spring, Chiang Kai-shek's American daddy began to provide him with complete American equipment. The regiment's three battalions were equipped with thirty-six American-made "105MM" howitzers, each company was also equipped with an American-made light machine gun platoon. Officers below platoon level carried American-made submachine guns, and battalion and company officers carried American-made pistols. The howitzers, artillery shells, and artillerymen were transported by American ten-wheel trucks, Dodge trucks, and Jeeps. The artillerymen wore American uniforms and were covered with blankets woven by the American "Peerless Woolenmills." In addition, each battalion was assigned one to three American instructors to train them to more "skillfully" slaughter the Chinese people.

    The American-equipped Tenth Artillery Regiment was fully equipped in April of this year. Chiang Kai-shek thought it was more than enough to eliminate the liberated areas and the people's army. They were transferred from distant Yunnan to Kaifeng after a four-month long march to attack the liberated areas north of the Longhai Railway. However, in the Dayang Lake annihilation battle in early September, the Tenth Artillery Regiment not only failed to save the fate of the doomed 3rd Division, but it had to flee in disarray itself.

    (II)

    On October 27th, relying on American intelligence (American staff members of the United Relief Organization had intruded into our operational rear under false pretenses), the three companies of the First Battalion of the Tenth Artillery Regiment drove twenty-four American military vehicles of various sizes, carrying eight howitzers, proudly and mightily from Heze towards "empty" Juancheng. On the afternoon of the 29th, Chiang Kai-shek's artillerymen, riding in their vehicles, arrived "safely" in the southern suburbs of Juancheng. He never dreamed that the Eighth Route Army, fighting on two legs, would suddenly descend from the sky. When they heard the gunshots, they realized that they had been heavily surrounded by the heroic Liu Bocheng's ever-victorious People's Army. The captured gunner Xu Zheru recalled the situation at the time, saying: "Although we fired so many shells, you were able to get so close all at once. What's the use of shells that are only effective from ten to twenty miles away?" Liu Guangxin, commander of the 119th Brigade, said: "The eight howitzers of the Tenth Artillery Regiment not only didn't play a role, but became a burden to me." In order to get rid of this burden, Liu Guangxin sent an urgent telegram to Liu Ruzhen in a moment of great crisis: "Break through today, guns lost but men survive; break through tomorrow, men and guns will both perish."

    However, at the same time that Liu Guangxin decided to break through, General Liu Bocheng had already set up an inescapable net. On the afternoon of the 31st, Liu Guangxin specially allocated nearly a thousand infantrymen to cover the "Tenth Artillery Regiment's" breakthrough. Under the Eighth Route Army's tight pursuit, the twenty-four vehicles cried out miserably as they fled in panic. When they fled to the front of the Yellow River dike, hundreds of light and heavy machine guns had already blocked their path on the dike. Countless hand grenades blossomed and exploded on the American equipment. Comrade Lan Tianshu, the leader of the Sixth Company of the × Platoon, took the lead in leading a squad to seize the first howitzer. Company Commander Li Jinxiang and Platoon Leader Ren Yuming climbed onto a ten-wheel truck throwing hand grenades, snatched the American-made machine guns from the dumbfounded Chiang Kai-shek artillerymen. They began to kneel on the vehicles and beg for mercy...

    (III)

    Chiang Kai-shek's artillerymen were originally the enemy of the people, but after they were liberated, they immediately became friends of the people.

    As soon as the battle ended, Wang Yanhui, a driver from the "Tenth Artillery Regiment," happily started his ten-wheel truck and transported the Eighth Route Army commanders and fighters from the front line to the rear. While skillfully turning the steering wheel, he smoked a cigarette and said: "I knew long ago that the Eighth Route Army treats prisoners of war and technical personnel well." When Wang Yanhui saw his partners were transporting spoils of war for the Eighth Route Army, he shouted happily: "Hey, let's set up a motor vehicle brigade here!"

    Every time a jeep passed through a village, smiling faces stretched out from every door to welcome the spoils of war and the newly liberated reinforcements. When the jeep drove into a market town in the dimness, its path was blocked by a dark mass of people in front of it. The young driver turned on the headlights, and the people excitedly watched and stroked the two huge howitzers. An old man with a white beard looked carefully and smiled: "Good, these are all good things sent by Chiang Kai-shek, let the dog days come again! Our Eighth Route Army will always clean him up!" At the request of the crowd, the lights were turned on again, and when the huge shadows of the howitzers reappeared, another electric cheer erupted from the crowd, and the glass on the jeep slightly vibrated.

    蒋介石炮兵营的毁灭
    冀鲁豫前线通讯
    蒋介石国防部炮十团第一营个炮兵连，在鄄城之战中，和刘汝珍部队同样遭到毁灭的命运，八门榴弹重炮，二十四辆汽车和全部美械都被八路军一齐缴获。
    （一）
    在蒋介石的辛苦经营下，“炮十团”已有十年的历史，原来装备的是德国造“１０５ＭＭ”榴弹炮。今年春天，蒋介石的美国爸爸替他开始了全部美械化，该团的三个营共装备了三十六门美造“１０５ＭＭ”榴弹炮，每连又配备一个美造轻机枪排，排以下军官都背着美造手提机枪，营连军官都带着美造手枪，载运榴弹炮和炮弹及炮兵的是美国十轮载重车、道奇卡车和吉普车、炮兵们穿的是美国军服，盖的是美国“无敌毛织厂”（Peerless Woolenmills）织造的毛毯。此外，每营又派了一个到三个美国教官，来训练他们更“熟练”地屠杀中国人民。
    美械化的炮十团在今年四月间装备完毕，蒋介石以为用来消灭解放区和人民军队是绰绰有余的，他们是以四个月的长途行军从遥远的云南调到开封，进攻陇海路北的解放区。但是，在九月上旬的大杨湖歼灭战中，炮十团不但没有挽救下整三师覆灭的命运，而它自己也只好抱头鼠窜而逃。
    （二）
    十月二十七日，凭着美国的情报（联总美籍职员曾借故闯入我作战后方），炮十团第一营的三个连就开动了大大小小的二十四辆美国军车，载着八门榴弹炮，骄傲地、浩浩荡荡地由荷泽奔向“空虚”的鄄城。二十九日下午，坐着汽车的蒋介石炮兵们“一路平安”，顺利的到了鄄城南郊，他做梦也没有想到：靠两条腿打仗的八路军会突然从天而降，当他们听到枪声时，才知道已经被英勇的刘伯承人民常胜军重重包围。被俘虏的炮手许哲如追述当时的情形说：“我们虽然打了那样多的炮弹，可是你们一下子就打到跟前来了，打出十里到二十里以外才有效的炮弹有啥用呢？”一一九旅旅长刘广信说：“炮十团的八门榴弹重炮不但没起作用，反而成了我的累赘。”为了丢开这个累赘，刘广信在万分危急之际给刘汝珍打了一个急电：“今日突围，炮亡人存，明日突围，人炮俱亡。”
    但是，在刘广信决定突围的同时，刘伯承将军已经布置好了天罗地网。卅一日下午，刘广信特别拨了近千的步兵来掩护“炮十团”突围。在八路军紧紧的追击下，二十四辆汽车悲凄的叫着在狼奔豕突，恐惧万分。当他们逃窜到黄河大堤的前面时，大堤上早已有几百挺轻重机枪挡住了他们的去路，无数的手榴弹在美国装备上开花爆炸，×中队六连连长兰田戍同志首先领导着一个班夺取了第一门榴弹炮，连长李金镶排长任玉明打着手榴弹爬上了十轮大卡车，把美造机枪从目瞪口呆的蒋介石炮兵手里夺过来，他们开始跪在汽车上求饶。……
    （三）
    蒋介石炮兵本来是人民的敌人，但在他们被解放以后，马上就成为人民的朋友。
    战斗刚一结束，“炮十团”的驾驶兵王言会就愉快地开动他的十轮大卡车把八路军的指战员从火线上送到后方，他一面熟练地转动着方向盘，一面吸着烟说：“我早就知道八路军是优待俘虏优待技术人员的。”当王言会看到他的伙伴们正在替八路军运送战利品时，他高兴地叫起来：“喂，我们就在这里成立汽车大队吧！”
    吉普车每经过一个村庄，每一家门里都伸出带着笑容的面孔来欢迎这战利品和被解放过来的生力军。当吉普车在昏黑中驶进一个集镇时，被前面一团黑压压的人群挡住去路，青年司机将车灯开开，人们在兴奋地观看和抚摩着两座巨大的榴弹炮，一个白胡老汉仔细看了又看，笑逐颜开的说：“好，这都是蒋介石送来的好东西，让狗日再来吧！咱们八路军总会把他收拾个干干净净！”在人群的要求下，电灯又一次开启，当榴弹炮的巨影重新出现时，人群中再一次发出电动的欢呼，吉普车上的玻璃都微微震动了。
