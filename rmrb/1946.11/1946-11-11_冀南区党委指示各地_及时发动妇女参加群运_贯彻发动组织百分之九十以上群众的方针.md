[This newspaper Weixian 4th dispatch] The Ji'nan District Party Committee recently issued instructions calling on all localities to pay attention to promptly mobilizing women to participate in the peasant emancipation movement, in order to achieve the policy of mobilizing and organizing over ninety percent of the masses. The instructions first criticized the "stage theory" viewpoint, saying: Some believe that women should only be mobilized in the later stages of peasant mobilization; others believe that the women's movement should start with production. Both of these ideas hinder the timely mobilization of the broad masses of women and are inconsistent with the spirit of uniting over ninety percent of the masses around the Party. The instructions then stated: (1) In newly liberated areas, when focusing efforts on mobilizing peasants to thoroughly resolve the land problem, equal importance should be given to mobilizing peasant women to actively participate in this movement and to absorbing women into leadership roles. The women participating in this stage are mainly older and middle-aged women, mostly single-handers or widows. When peasant mobilization reaches a certain level, and the class consciousness of the peasants is raised, the women's movement, with the sympathy and support of the broad masses of peasants, will shift to a movement against feudal shackles. Generally, it starts with promoting family harmony and opposing abuse, and further appropriately resolving issues of clothing and food, striving for freedom of social activities, and opposing certain extremely unreasonable marriage systems. In this stage, the women participating are mainly the broad masses of young women. However, because the content and focus are different before and after, some complex and difficult problems are encountered in the transition process. Such as changes in organizational composition (in the previous stage, the participants were mainly older and middle-aged women, and in the later stage, the participants were mainly young women) and leadership adjustments (in the later stage, a large number of young women leaders and activists will emerge). These issues must be handled carefully in the development of the movement, otherwise it will cause division and contradictions among the women. (2) In old liberated areas, in this re-examination of rent reduction (that is, further thoroughly resolving the land problem), the broad masses of women should first be mobilized to participate in the rent reduction movement, and then immediately shift to the movement of family harmony and opposition to feudal shackles; because there is some foundation for the previous work, the two steps can be combined into one, depending on the local situation at the time. Finally, it pointed out: In this winter's winter school movement, women's literacy classes or women's winter schools should be widely organized, so that women's literacy classes or women's winter schools can become a powerful weapon for mobilizing, educating and organizing women.

    冀南区党委指示各地
    及时发动妇女参加群运
    贯彻发动组织百分之九十以上群众的方针
    【本报威县四日电】冀南区党委顷发出指示，号召各地注意及时发动妇女参加农民翻身运动，以达到发动与组织百分之九十以上群众的方针。该指示首先批评了“阶段论”的观点说：有的认为只有等到农民发动的后期，再发动妇女；有的认为妇女运动应从生产入手，这两种思想都障碍了广大妇女群众的及时发动，与团结百分之九十以上群众在党的周围的精神不符。该指示接着写道：（一）在新解放区，当集中力量发动农民彻底解决土地问题时，同时应高度注意发动农民妇女积极参加这一运动，并吸收妇女参加领导。在这一阶段参加的妇女主要是老年与壮年妇女，多系独手人或寡妇。当农民发动到一定程度，农民阶级觉悟提高，妇女运动即在广大农民同情与支持下，转入反封建束缚的运动，一般的是从提倡家庭和睦、反虐待开始，并进一步适当解决管穿，争取社会活动的自由，与反对某些极不合理的婚姻制度等问题。在这一阶段，参加的妇女，主要的是广大的青年妇女。但因为前后内容与重点不同，在转变过程中是遇到一些复杂困难问题的。如组织成份的改变（在前一阶段参加的以老年与壮年为主，后一阶段参加的以青年妇女为主）与领导的调整（在后一阶段将涌现出大批的青年妇女领袖与积极分子），这些问题在运动的发展中要慎重去处理，不然会引起妇女群众间的分裂与矛盾。（二）老解放区在这次查减中（即进一步彻底解决土地问题），先动员广大妇女参加查减运动，紧接着就转入家庭和睦，反对封建束缚的运动；因为过去有些工作基础，两步并成一步走也可以，要看当地当时情况而定。最后指出：在今冬冬学运动中，要广泛的去组织妇女识字班或妇女冬学，使妇女识字班或妇女冬学成为发动妇女与教育组织妇女的有力武器。
