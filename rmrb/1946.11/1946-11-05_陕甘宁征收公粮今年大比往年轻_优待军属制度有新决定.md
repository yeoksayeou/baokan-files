Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st: The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government, in order to better guarantee the supply of materials for the self-defense war, recently issued an order to collect 163,000 *shi* of public grain and 21 million *jin* of public fodder for the 35th year. Note: Last year, the border region's autumn harvest totaled 1.2 million *shi* of fine grain, with public grain collection accounting for 15 percent of the total harvest, while this year it only accounts for 9.05 percent.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st: The Civil Affairs Department of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government recently held a joint meeting of section chiefs and decided to improve the system of preferential treatment for military families. The preliminary measures are: in terms of material preferential treatment, families of staff members who have already implemented a salary system will not be eligible for preferential treatment. Families of staff members engaged in production in government organizations, whose lives are difficult, will be helped by their organizations. In terms of the burden on the masses, it is determined that wealth and labor will be shared. Public grain will be distributed according to wealth standards, and public firewood will be distributed according to labor standards, and a system of unified planning and allocation at the county level will be implemented. However, it is necessary to prevent localism among districts and townships, and to implement top-down adjustments to overcome the disparities between counties. Regarding helping to establish household affairs, it is first necessary to ideologically educate cadres, the masses, and military families to recognize the long-term nature of this work.

　　陕甘宁征收公粮今年大比往年
    优待军属制度有新决定
    【新华社延安一日电】陕甘宁边区政府，为了更好的保证自卫战争的物资供给，特于日前发出征收三十五年度公粮十六万三千石，公草二千一百万斤的命令。按：去年边区秋收共收细粮一百二十万石，征收公粮数占总收获量百分之十五，而今年只占总收获量百分之九点零五。
    【新华社延安一日电】陕甘宁边区政府民政厅，于日前召开的一科长联席会，决定改进优待军属制度；其初步办法，为物资优待方面，已实行薪金制的工作人员的家属，不得享受优待。机关生产人员的家属，生活贫苦的由本机关帮助解决。群众负担方面，确定财劳共负。公粮以财富标准分配，公柴以劳力标准分配，并实行以县为统筹统支的单位，但须防止各区乡间的本位观念，并实行自上而下的调剂，以克服各县间的悬殊。关于帮助建立家务方面，首先必须从思想上教育干部，群众及军工属，认识这一工作的长期性。
