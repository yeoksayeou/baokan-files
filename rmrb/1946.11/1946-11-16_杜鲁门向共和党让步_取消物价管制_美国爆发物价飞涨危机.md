Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 13th: Washington Dispatch: U.S. President Truman issued an order on the 10th to abolish all price controls. This is the first concession made by Truman to the Republicans and the big capitalists behind them in domestic affairs after the congressional elections. The main items for which price limits have been lifted include automobiles, coal, steel, rubber, clothing fabrics, and furniture. It is expected that general prices will increase by 100% after the controls are lifted. It is estimated that lumber will increase by 100%, furniture by 25%, automobiles by 15%, stoves by 30%, and coal will increase from $0.30 per ton to $1.00. The United States is currently experiencing a price hike crisis. As of yesterday, General Motors' passenger cars and trucks have already risen by $100. The Department of Commerce reported on the 8th that U.S. commodity exports in August were $741.1 million. Exports in the first eight months of this year totaled $4.899 billion, which is still far from the $15 billion in exports required for the United States to maintain full employment and wartime production levels. In addition, a senior U.S. government official told Associated Press reporters on the 7th that after the government party's election defeat, all price and wage controls would be lifted within one or two days, according to the Republican Party's proposal.

    杜鲁门向共和党让步
    取消物价管制
    美国爆发物价飞涨危机
    【新华社延安十三日电】华盛顿讯：美总统杜鲁门于十日下令，取消一切物价管制。此为杜氏在国会选举后，在内政方面对共和党及其后台大资本家的首次让步。取消限价之主要物品有汽车、煤钢、橡皮、衣服织物及家具等。各方预料管制解除后，一般物价将增加百分之百。据估计木料将增加百分之百，家具将增加百分之二十五，汽车百分之十五，火炉百分之三十，煤将自每吨三角增至一元。目前美国正爆发物价飞涨之危机，迄昨日止，通用汽车公司之客车与货车已上涨一百美元。商务部于八日报告，八月份美商品输出为七亿四千一百万美元。今年头八个月输出共四十八亿九千九百万美元，此与美国欲维持充分就业与战时生产水平所需之一百五十亿美元输出相去尚远。又美国某高级政府官员于七日告美联社记者称：政府党选举失败后，将于一二日内取消一切物价与工资之管制，按此为共和党之主张。
