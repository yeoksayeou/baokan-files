　　Battle for Every House in Renzhuang
　　On September 31st, our unit, after a night march of seventy li, immediately entered the battle of Renzhuang, and the Fifth Company was one of the main attacking forces. Company Commander Comrade Liu Sizong pointed to a house on the edge of the village and ordered the Third Platoon to launch an assault to the south. Platoon Leader Wang Jiangke led his brave warriors through intense crossfire to advance. Seventh Squad Leader Comrade Li Qiu used grenades to clear the way, soldier Tian Guifu dug tunnels with a shovel, and Ding Debao led the charge with a machine gun. In this way, they quickly broke through courtyard after courtyard, occupying two courtyards, capturing seven enemies, and seizing five guns.
　　When the ladder was set up against the third courtyard, Eighth Squad Leader Li Jinrong fell from the ladder, and those behind him rushed to climb up. In this brief moment, Wang Jiangke and seven or eight other comrades gloriously sacrificed their lives. The First Platoon continued the assault, with Third Squad Deputy Tao Jinchuan, Chen Xicai, and Zhao Jinde climbing onto the roof one after another to throw grenades. Below, Squad Leader Li Chengshuan quickly dug a large hole in the wall. Then Li Chengshuan, armed with hand grenades, Shi Mancang, carrying a basket of grenades, and Yang Yukuan, holding a rifle, formed a heroic combat team. They worked together like farmers helping each other plant and fertilize in the fields, organized and methodical.
　　They bravely charged into the courtyard, and the stubborn enemies retreated under the fierce attack, those who were not killed surrendering their weapons. They climbed onto the roofs, dug holes, and the company quickly advanced through four courtyards. When the hand grenades were used up, Shi Mancang refilled the basket with grenades picked up from the enemy and brought them over.
　　More than twenty enemies counterattacked from the courtyard in front, but were repelled twice. The house had been set on fire by the enemy, and thick smoke filled the air. After a volley of gunfire, the heroes charged into the courtyard and found three mountain guns squatting inside the house. They were overjoyed: "Good heavens, cannons!" The eastern and northern houses where the cannons were placed were burning fiercely, and shells were exploding. As the Second Platoon prepared to pull out the cannons, soldier Liu Zhaoyu dug a hole in the back wall. Fan Zhengqing, who had been liberated in the Dayang Lake campaign, was the first to crawl in, followed by five others. Braving the thick smoke, flames, and falling burning debris from the roof, they pulled out one cannon. The remaining two cannons were covered by fire, and the flames blocked the path of approach. Everyone quickly found ropes, splashed water, and dug, tying the ropes to the gun carriages, and pulled them out one by one.
　　In the morning sunlight, the heroes' smiling faces looked even more radiant. (Report from the Jilu豫 Front)

　　任庄逐屋战
    九月三十一日，我某部队夜行车七十里后，马上投入任庄之战斗，而且五连是主攻部队之一。连长刘思总同志指着村边的一座房子，命令三排向南突击时，排长王江科就领着他的勇士们，穿过激烈的侧射，突击前进。七班长李秋同志，用炸弹在前面开路，战士田贵福用洋锹挖洞打通道，丁德保端着机枪打前锋，就这样迅速穿过一院又一院，占领了两座院子，捉了七个敌人，缴获五支枪。
    到第三座院子的梯子已经架起，八班长李金荣同志在梯子上倒了下来，后边的人又抢着上。就在这一会，王江科等七八个同志光荣的牺牲了。一排接着突击上去，三班副陶金川和陈喜才、赵金德一个个的爬上房扔炸弹。下面一班长李成拴，几下子就把墙挖了个大洞。于是李成拴掂着手榴弹，石满仓提着一篮子炸弹，杨玉宽端着步枪，这个英勇的战斗小组，好像农民在田野里互助下种、施肥，有组织，有次序。
    他们英勇的冲进院子，顽强的敌人在猛烈打击下退下去，没有死的都缴了枪。他们上房、挖洞，很敏捷的一连穿过了四座院。手榴弹打光了，石满仓又把敌人丢下的炸弹拣满一篮送来。
    二十多个敌人从前面院子里向我反扑，两次都被打退了。房子已被敌人点着，浓烟冲天。一阵排子枪后，英雄们冲进院里，发现屋里蹲着三门山炮，真高兴极了：“乖乖，大炮！”大火烧着放着炮的东房和北房，炮弹在轰炸，二排同志要拉大炮了，战士刘照玉在后墙挖了个洞。大杨湖战役解放过来的范正卿首先钻进去，接着又进去了五个，冒着浓烟烈火和房上掉下的火块，拉出了一门炮。其余的两门炮被火盖住，火焰挡住了接近的道路，大家赶紧找绳、泼水、挖掘，将绳套在炮架上，一门门的拉了出来。
    在早晨的阳光下，英雄们欢笑的脸，更显得红润了。（本报冀鲁豫前线电）
