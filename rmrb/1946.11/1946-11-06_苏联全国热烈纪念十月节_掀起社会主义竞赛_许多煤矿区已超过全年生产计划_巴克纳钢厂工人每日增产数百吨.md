Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd: Moscow dispatch: The 29th anniversary of the Soviet October Revolution (November 7th) is approaching. The entire country is commemorating this glorious festival with a warm socialist emulation campaign. The Donets coal miners are playing a leading role in the competition, and many mining areas have already exceeded their 1946 production plans. The Alexander Spac large mining area completed its annual production plan on the 22nd of last month. In terms of iron, steel, and rolled metal production, it will exceed the pre-war level by 35% in 1950. The Yekaterinburg workers are producing a large amount of metal for the country, exceeding the original plan by hundreds of thousands of tons. The blast furnace workers at the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works have produced 10,000 tons of steel more than planned. In Leningrad's largest turbine manufacturing plant in the country, six 102,000-horsepower turbines are being built to replace the turbines destroyed by the German bandits at the Dnieper Dam. Many factories in Leningrad have completed their eleven-month plans, and most of the workers in these factories have completed their annual production volume. In Bakner, steel smelting workers are playing an advanced role in non-ferrous metal factories, producing hundreds of tons of steel more than planned every day. The Ukrainian food industry completed its annual plan in ten months, exceeding the production plan by approximately 10 million rubles worth of various foods. The Kharkov automobile factory has completed one year or even two years of production. Factories in Kiev will transport a large number of new agricultural machines to rural areas. The Ukrainian metalworkers, under the leadership of the Stalin Steel Factory, have exceeded the plan by 10,000 tons of steel and 13,000 tons of rolled iron sheets this year. The most successful are the workers at the Dneprodzerzhinsk Railway Car Factory, who have produced the first batch of 1,000 various metal trucks. In Uzbekistan, which was a prairie area four years ago, steel factories equipped with modern machines now stand tall. Tova Bankov, a representative of the Supreme Soviet and a foundry worker at the factory, produced twice as much as planned this year.
