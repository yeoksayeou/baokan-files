　　Satisfying Farmers' Land Demands
    Chengci Fourth District Completes Leveling and Equalization
    Creating Important Experience: (1) Joint struggle of several villages, (2) Mobilizing wealthy villages to sell or donate land to poor villages, (3) Merging wealthy and poor villages to equalize.
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] In the land reform movement in Chengci Fourth District of Southern Hebei, the masses encountered many difficulties due to the disparity of land between wealthy and poor villages. In a wealthy village, each person could often have an average of four to six mu of land, but in a poor village, each person had an average of less than three mu of land. For example, Wangheng Village in the district had a population of 745 people and a total of 2,922 mu of land, averaging 3.9 mu per person. However, in its neighboring village, Zhangwuzhuang, with a population of 448, there were 1,105 mu of land, averaging only 2.4 mu per person. In light of this situation, and to further promote the movement throughout the district, thoroughly realize "land to the tiller," and fully satisfy farmers' land demands, the leaders of the Fourth District launched a heated "leveling and equalization" movement throughout the district. This movement immediately received the support of emancipated farmers, plunging the farmers in all seven pilot villages in the district into a new upsurge of the movement. According to the district's experience, the following are specific measures for leveling and equalization: (1) Adopt a joint struggle of several villages and jointly distribute the fruits to transfer land to poor villages. Wangheng Village, a wealthy village in the Fourth District of Chengci, transferred 196 mu of land to poor villages in the joint struggle. Qinlianzhuang, a poor village, also adopted this method and obtained 130 mu of land from the wealthy villages of Nanshangcheng and Lilianzhuang. (2) Mobilize wealthy villages to sell a portion of their land to poor villages. For example, in Beibangliu Village, each person could have an average of ten mu of land. If each person still had six mu of land, the village would have a surplus of 600 mu of land. Therefore, the practice of mobilizing these villages to sell a portion of their land to poor villages has achieved great results. (3) Solve the problem of land mortgage between villages. Generally, land mortgaged by wealthy villages to poor villages is treated as permanently sold land, while land mortgaged by poor villages to wealthy villages can be redeemed by the poor villages and uniformly distributed to poor households by the farmers. Wuji Village, a poor village in the Fourth District, obtained 70 mu of land from wealthy villages in this way. (4) Adopt the method of merging villages to solve the difficulty of land disparity. Dongbaozhuang (wealthy village) and Xibaozhuang (poor village) in the district were originally two natural villages of the same village. Over the years, they had been divided into two villages due to disputes between the two sides. In this land reform movement, the masses' thinking was clarified, and the two villages were merged. The farmers of the two villages re-entered unity, and each person obtained an average of 4.5 mu of land. (5) In the upsurge of the leveling and equalization movement, wealthy villagers can be encouraged to donate a portion of their land to poor villages. The most basic key to carrying out the above leveling and equalization work lies in clarifying the thinking of cadres and the masses, conducting in-depth mobilization among the masses, and extensively carrying out class education of "farmers all over the world are one family, everyone cultivates the land together, and everyone eats together," enlightening the spirit of mutual assistance and love between farmers, and breaking the localist thinking between villages. In mobilization and education, a successful experience is to first clarify the thinking of cadres and activists, and then clarify the thinking of the masses. Currently, the masses in Chengci Fourth District have smoothly carried out the leveling and equalization movement, thoroughly realizing "land to the tiller," and each farmer in the district has obtained three to four mu of land. The emancipated masses showed unprecedented unity and joy. They excitedly said that the Communist Party and Chairman Mao's methods are really good, and we now have food to eat and land to cultivate. Villages that were not united in the past due to the instigation of the ruling class are now more united. Farmers in poor villages are very grateful to farmers in wealthy villages because they have obtained land. Wealthy villages also feel infinitely honored to be able to distribute land to poor villages. The spirit of farmers' great unity and friendship is overflowing everywhere in the vast countryside. Now, the emancipated masses throughout the district have been fully mobilized for combat, under the will to resolutely resist Chiang Kai-shek's offensive and defend their own emancipated interests, and are fully supporting the front line of the patriotic self-defense war. They firmly stated that we will never stop until we eliminate those bad guys who are attacking us.

　　满足农民土地要求
    成磁四区完成填平补齐
    创造重要经验：（一）数村联合斗争，（二）动员富村卖地或赠地给贫村，（三）富村与贫村合并补齐。
    【本报特讯】冀南成磁四区群众，在实行土地改革运动中，碰到了许多贫富村土地悬殊的困难。在一个富村，往往每人可以平均土地四亩到六亩，但在贫村，每人土地还平均不到三亩。如该区王横村，全村七百四十五口人，共有土地二九二二亩，每人平均土地三·九亩，但在他的邻村张武庄，全村四四八口人，土地一一○五亩，平均每人只合土地二·四亩。四区领导上，根据此种情况，为更进一步推动全区运动，彻底实现耕者有其田，充分满足农民土地要求，全区遂热烈的展开了“填平补齐”运动。这一运动马上得到翻身农民的拥护和支持，使全区七个基点村的农民，都卷入新的运动热潮中。根据该区经验，填平补齐有如下几点具体办法：（一）采取数村联合斗争，共同分配果实，以达到转移土地给贫村。四区富村王横成村，就在联合斗争中转移了一百九十六亩土地给贫村。贫村秦连庄，也采取此种办法，从富村南上成、李连庄获得土地一百三十亩。（二）动员富村出卖土地一部给穷村。如北傍柳村，全村每人可以平均十亩地，若每人仍以六亩地计算，该村尚余六百亩土地，因此动员这些村庄出卖一部分土地给穷村的作法，取得了极大的成效。（三）通过解决村与村的土地典当问题，一般富村典当给贫村的土地，均一律作为死地，贫村典当给富村的土地，则可由贫村赎回，由农民统一分配给贫户。四区贫村武吉村，就这样从富村获得了七十亩土地。（四）采用合村办法，解决土地悬殊困难。该区东保庄（富村）西保庄（贫村）原是一村的两个自然村，历年来因双方纠纷而分成了两村，这次土地改革运动中，打通了群众思想，实行了合村，两村农民重新走入了团结，每人平均得到土地四亩五分。（五）在填平补齐运动热潮中，可以鼓励富村群众，赠送一部份土地给穷村。在进行以上填平补齐工作中，最基本的关键，即在于打通干部与群众思想，深入向群众进行动员，广泛进行“天下农民是一家，有地大家种，有饭大家吃”的阶级教育，启发农民之间的互助友爱精神，打碎村与村的本位思想。在动员教育中，成功的经验是先打通干部积极分子思想，然后再打通群众的思想。现成磁四区群众，已顺利的进行了填平补齐运动，彻底实现了耕者有其田，全区每个农民都已获得三亩到四亩土地。翻身的群众，表现了从所未有的团结和喜悦，他们很感奋的说共产党毛主席的办法真是好，咱们现在有饭吃也有地种了。过去因为统治阶级的挑拨，不团结的村庄现在更加团结了，贫村的农民，因为获得了土地，对富村农民，非常的感谢，富村也以能把土地分给贫村而感到无限光荣，农民大团结的友爱精神在广大农村到处洋溢着。现全区翻身群众，在坚决抵抗蒋介石进攻，保卫自己翻身利益的意志下，又已全部战斗动员起来，全力支援着爱国自卫战争的前线，他们坚定的表示我们不消灭那批进攻我们的坏蛋，我们决不休止。
