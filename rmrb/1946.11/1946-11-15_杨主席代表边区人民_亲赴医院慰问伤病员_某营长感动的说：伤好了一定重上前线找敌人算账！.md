[Report from this newspaper in the Jin-Lu-Yu area on the 13th] After Chairman Yang of the Border Region Government visited the heroic soldiers on the self-defense battlefield at the front lines, he went to the rear hospital with Vice Director Jia of the Jin-Lu-Yu Administrative Office on October 28th to慰问 the sick and wounded soldiers. Within three days, they visited 120 wards and met with 2,000 sick and wounded soldiers and 300 medical workers. Chairman Yang highly praised the sick and wounded comrades' heroic and tenacious fighting spirit, the hospital staff's hard work attitude, and the new treatment methods. The sick and wounded comrades were extremely excited after receiving the cordial greetings. Commander × of a certain battalion said to Chairman Yang with great spirit: "I was wounded on the Longhai Front, and I was wounded again at Zhangfengji. When I recover, I have to settle this account with the enemy." Chairman Yang and Vice Director Jia also sent a letter of慰问 to all the sick and wounded soldiers, stating: "Dear comrades, the sick and wounded, and comrades working in the hospital, you were gloriously wounded in the battle to defend the liberated areas and annihilate the invading troops. With the active efforts and hard work of the medical staff, new treatment methods have been created, which not only reduce the pain of the gloriously wounded comrades, but also enable them to quickly recover and return to the battlefield to annihilate the invading troops. We have taken the time and brought some慰劳 goods and cash, representing the feelings of all the organs, groups, and 30 million people in the border region, to pay tribute and慰问 to the comrades. Thanks to the comrades' heroic tenacity, resourcefulness, and skillful fighting, active and hard work spirit, and the full support of the people in the border region, our border region has annihilated Chiang Kai-shek's huge living strength. Although Chiang's troops are still advancing, the extension of the invading troops' front lines, transportation difficulties, dispersal of forces, and empty defenses are giving us new opportunities to annihilate the invading troops' living strength. Now the rear is working intensely and enthusiastically to support the front lines. The morale of the officers and soldiers at the front is very high, and the upsurge of the broad masses of people joining the army and participating in the war is constantly growing. This is the actual strength for us to defeat Chiang's troops and achieve final victory. We have full confidence that Chiang's troops will be defeated, and final victory will surely belong to the people and the people's army.
	We hope that the sick and wounded comrades will rest peacefully and recover their health as soon as possible."

    某营长感动的说：伤好了一定重上前线找敌人算账！
    【本报冀鲁豫十三日电】边府杨主席亲赴前线慰问自卫战场上的英勇将士后，复于十月二十八日偕同冀鲁豫行署贾副主任到后方医院慰问伤病员，三天内访问一百二十间病房，和两千个伤病员及三百个医务工作者见了面。杨主席对伤病员同志英勇顽强的作战精神，医院工作同志的艰苦工作态度，和新治疗法予以高度的赞扬。伤病员同志受到亲切的慰问后，均极兴奋。×营长精神饱满的向杨主席说：“我在陇海前线即曾负伤，在张凤集又带了花，等我好了，得和敌人算算这个账”。杨主席贾副主任并有慰问信致全体伤病员，略谓：“亲爱的伤病员同志们、医院工作的同志们，在保卫解放区歼灭进犯军的作战中，你们光荣的负伤了，在医务工作同志们积极努力艰苦工作下，创造出新的治疗法，使光荣负伤的同志们不但减少痛苦，而且能很快的恢复健康，重上战场歼灭进犯军。我们特抽出时间，并带来一些慰劳物品与现金，代表后方所有机关团体及边区三千万人民的心情，向同志们致敬致慰。由于同志们的英勇顽强，机智善战、积极努力工作的精神和边区人民全力支持，我边区已歼灭了蒋介石庞大的有生力量。目前蒋军虽仍在前进，但由于进犯军战线的延长，运输困难，兵力分散，守备空虚，正给了我们歼灭进犯军有生力量的作战方针以新的机会，现在后方正以紧张的工作，热烈地支持前线，前方将士们士气又是十二分的旺盛，广大人民参军参战热潮在不断增长，这就是我们战胜蒋军取得最后胜利的实际力量。我们有充分的信心，蒋军必败，最后胜利一定是属于人民与人民的军队的。
    希望伤病员同志们静心的休养，早复健康”。
