Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 31st: Anti-war actions by Chiang's army in Northeast China have begun to appear among lower and middle-ranking officers in Chiang's direct lineage troops. In mid-month, Battalion Commander Tan Yi (少校), Company Commander Zhang Ruoyu, and Battalion Adjutant Tan Chao, all of the 1st Battalion, 29th Regiment, 207th Division of the New Sixth Army on the Jilin front, defected to the Democratic Allied Army. They stated: Tan's battalion (actually a regiment) had a total of 730 men in June. In the past three months, excluding those who died of serious illness, more than 350 men deserted, leaving about 300 men. Generally, lower-ranking officers express dissatisfaction with Chiang's reliance on the United States to launch a frenzied civil war. In order to ease the anti-war sentiment of the soldiers, Chiang's military authorities distributed 50 yuan in consolation money to each person in the direct lineage troops such as the New First Army, New Sixth Army, and Fifty-second Army, but with little effect.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 30th: Nanjing News: More and more Chiang's army officers and soldiers are committing suicide due to war-weariness. Three soldiers from the 10th Artillery Regiment in Nanjing, due to war-weariness and homesickness, disguised themselves and fled. One of them was captured and brought back, and four days later he was escorted to search for the other two. Taking advantage of the guards' carelessness, he raised a large kitchen knife in a carving shop and committed suicide by slitting his throat. Furthermore, Wu Jie, the deputy squad leader of a certain unit of the Beiping Transportation Corps, recently committed suicide by crashing a military vehicle in front of the US consulate. On September 27th, a Nationalist soldier named Jin Zhong in Xuzhou committed suicide in a hotel. In his suicide note, he stated: "Now I feel very afraid of the civil war, and I am suffering from not having a way to withdraw from the civil war, so I resolutely commit suicide to escape this terrible reality."

　　东北蒋军嫡系谭营长等
    反对内战向我投诚
    南京北平蒋军官兵厌战自杀
    【新华社东北三十一日电】东北蒋军罢战反战行动已开始见诸蒋军嫡系部队之中下级军官中。本月中旬，吉林前线之新六军二○七师二十九团一营少校营长谭毅、二连连长张若愚、营部副官谭超等向民主联军投诚。彼等称：谭营（现实为团）六月间共七百三十人，三个月来，除重病死亡者外，逃跑者三百五十余人，现剩余三百人左右。一般下级军官对蒋之依仗美国疯狂内战，均表不满，蒋军事当局为缓和士兵反战情绪，给新一军、新六军、五十二军等嫡系部队发给每人慰劳金五十元，但收效甚微。
    【新华社延安三十日电】南京讯：蒋军官兵厌战自杀者日多。南京炮兵第十团三士兵因厌战思家，易装逃走，其中一人被捉回后四日又被押寻其他二人。他趁人不备，在一刻字店内举起大裁刀刎颈自杀。又北平辎重兵团某部副班长吴杰，日前乘军车行往美领事馆前撞车自杀身死。九月二十七日徐州一名金重的国民党军人在旅馆自杀，其遗书内称：“现在我非常感到内战的可怕，又苦于没有方法退出内战，所以才毅然地自杀以逃避这恶劣的现实。”
