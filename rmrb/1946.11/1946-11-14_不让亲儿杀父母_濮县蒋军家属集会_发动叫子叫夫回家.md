    Not Letting Sons Kill Parents
    Puyang County KMT Soldier Families Gather
    Launch Campaign to Call Sons and Husbands Home
    [Our newspaper's report from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region, 11th] The families of KMT soldiers in Puyang County bitterly denounced Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the country and harm to their children, and resolved to call their sons and husbands home. On the 12th of last month, Puyang County held separate symposiums for families of KMT soldiers throughout the county. At the meeting held by the county government, representatives of the county government, in addition to reporting in detail to everyone on Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the country and the crimes of attacking the liberated areas, also stated the attitude of the democratic government: the families of KMT soldiers are not discriminated against, because most of their children were either captured by the enemy and puppet regime or deceived by KMT special agents. After the representatives of the county government spoke, the family members spoke enthusiastically. They were deeply moved by the democratic government's generous attitude. Therefore, an old gentleman in his forties said indignantly: "My son is in the Central Army. Who knew that this good-for-nothing grandson called Lao Jiang would be leading them to do such a treasonous thing! I'm inquiring about my son's news and will definitely call him back." Another person added: "I have to call my son back too. If he doesn't come back, I will sever my father-son relationship with him." Chen Dengkai pointed out painfully: "Our children are working in the Central Army, but the Central Army still comes to harm us in the same way. Isn't this harming ourselves? Everyone, think about it, shouldn't we call our children back quickly?" Another old man in his seventies was so angry that he couldn't speak for a long time. He said resentfully: "Lao Jiang has been capturing my son for all these years, but the democratic government has never mistreated us old couple. The village helps me farm the land and provides relief, and I bought land again. Lao Jiang! If it weren't for you, you good-for-nothing grandson, wouldn't my son be enjoying happiness in the base area too?" Li Fangzhong's sister-in-law from Xingdian also cried loudly and said: "The Central Army has been capturing my younger brother for all these years, and now they are leading him to be an American traitor to kill our own family. Can we still wait for our children to come and kill us? ......" As she spoke, she cried and couldn't speak. In the end, everyone unanimously expressed that they would resolutely follow the democratic government to the end. After returning, they will immediately find a way to call their sons and husbands back and never let them be traitors again to kill their own people. Now, the movement of KMT soldiers' families calling for their sons and husbands is being enthusiastically launched in the entire Puyang County. It will cause hundreds and thousands of KMT soldiers to lay down their weapons and return to the people's side, becoming one of the powerful conditions for crushing Chiang Kai-shek's attack on the liberated areas.

    不让亲儿杀父母
    濮县蒋军家属集会
    发动叫子叫夫回家
    【本报冀鲁豫十一日电】濮县蒋军家属痛骂蒋介石卖国，坑害自己子弟，决心叫子叫夫回家。上月十二日，濮县全县分别召开蒋军家属座谈会。在县政府召开的会议上，县府代表除向大家详细报告了蒋介石的卖国及进攻解放区的罪行外，并表明民主政府的态度，对蒋军家属并不歧视，因为他们的子弟大多数是被敌伪抓去或被蒋特欺骗去的。在县府代表讲话后，各家属即热烈发言，他们都深深被民主政府这种宽大的态度感动了因此一个四十多岁的老先生首先愤慨地说：“我的儿在中央军里，谁知道叫老蒋这个孬孙领着干这样卖国的事呀！我打听着我儿的信，一定叫他回来。”另一个接着也说：“我也得叫我儿回来，如果不回来，我就和他断绝父子关系。”陈登楷则沉痛的指出：“咱们的孩子在中央军里干事，可是，中央军过来还是一样的糟害咱们，这不是自己害自己么？大家想想，还不把咱的孩子快叫回来。”另一位七十多岁的老头子更气愤的半晌说不出话来，他恨恨地说：“老蒋把俺儿抓去这些年了，民主政府可没有慢待过俺老两口，村里帮我种地，救济我，俺又买了地。老蒋呵！要不是你这孬孙，俺儿不是也在根据地享福了么？”幸店李方仲的嫂也大声哭诉着说：“中央军把俺小抓去这些年，现在领着他当了美国的汉奸来杀咱自家来了，咱们还能等着叫咱的孩子来杀咱么？………”他说着说着哭的说不出话来了。最后，大家一致表示，坚决跟着民主政府干到底。回去后，马上就想办法，把自己的儿子、丈夫叫回来，绝不让他们再当汉奸，来杀害自家人。现在，蒋军家属的叫子叫夫运动，已在全濮县热烈的发动起来了，它将使成百成千的蒋军放下武器，回到人民方面来，成为粉碎蒋介石进攻解放区的有力条件之一。
