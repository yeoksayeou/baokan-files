White Russian Children Return to the Motherland
    —Where Youth Have Bright Futures, Where the Elderly Are Respected Everywhere.

    This is spring in autumn. The sun is so bright that it feels like a warm and fragrant day. On the wharf of the Jianghai Customs, dozens of children, shouting happily, along with the adults who came to see them off, crowded the wide wharf. The Soviet ship "Smolny" was steadily anchored in the center of the Huangpu River as if rooted to the spot. The customs' passenger boat arrived and took this noisy group onto the big ship anchored in the distance. The engine churned the river, and the small boat chugged toward the big ship. Upon reaching the big ship, amidst cheers of "Hurrah, Smolny! Hurrah, Russia!", fifty-seven children eagerly stepped onto the ship one after another. A girl named Nina, with a small braid tied with a red satin ribbon, turned to her mother and asked, "Mommy, is this Russia?" Everyone around laughed. Her mother told her, "Child, this is not Russia yet, this is a Russian ship."

    When the reporter boarded the ship, the deck was already a children's paradise. The autumn sun illuminated their faces, and the river breeze stirred their hair. The joy of stepping onto a new continent burned in their hearts. Together with the red sickle and axe flag on the stern and the boundless blue sky behind the flag, everyone would sing the praises of this scene filled with peace and hope.

    The "Smolny" is a 6,500-ton cargo ship, a bridge of maritime transportation between China and the Soviet Union. Now it has become a children's paradise. Some children are saying goodbye to adults, while others, like tireless squirrels, are climbing on the deck and diving into the hold. The reporter took the opportunity to chat with some of them.

    The first was a girl named Danya, only seventeen years old, but already a voluptuous young woman, with a childlike heart still wrapped in a mature body. She told me that her father originally ran a sausage factory in Shanghai, but it was occupied by the Japanese during the war. They went to Qingdao, but their residence in Qingdao was requisitioned by the US Navy. So they returned to Shanghai, and she decided to go to the Soviet Union—a motherland she had never seen before. Her ideal is to become a radio operator.

    "Aren't you afraid of separating from your parents?" the reporter asked.

    She smiled sweetly and said, "No, they are going to the Soviet Union soon too."

    The second child, named Kasanov, told me that he would go to the Soviet Union to join the Navy. He was born in Shanghai and lived in Hongkou. His father had died, and he said he would become a captain in the Red Navy.

    "You don't have money, can you enter the naval academy?"

    "The government will take care of me," he said.

    The reporter shook his hand, wishing him the realization of his ideals, and then turned to another older child named Klimenko to talk. He wore a short coat with a leather collar, looking particularly tall, but was actually only nineteen years old. He originally studied engineering at Aurora University and is now preparing to study aviation. His father now works at the Shanghai Soviet Radio Station. The elderly couple also came to see him off.

    At this time, a blonde girl wearing overalls walked up to the reporter. She was only fifteen years old, named Flandin. She is the leader of this group of children, leading ten of them. When asked about her aspirations, she also said she wanted to be a radio operator, her pale gray eyes showing full pride and confidence.

    In the noisy atmosphere, a child stood alone by the ship's railing, gazing at an American warship on the riverbank. When the reporter went to talk to him, he found that he could neither hear nor speak, and could only make a face at the reporter. An adult came over and told the reporter that he was a deaf-mute child, but he would not become a useless person. He has artistic talent, and they decided to send him back to study music and painting.

    There was another child with a thin face, still comforting his mother beside her. He said he wanted to go to the Soviet Union to learn to fly airplanes. He had been to Jiangwan and Longhua airports and often watched giant airplanes landing and taking off outside the field.

    "Are you well enough to do it being so thin?"

    "I will get fat when I get to the Soviet Union," he told the reporter.

    These children's parents were mostly White Russians who were struggling on the poverty line in Shanghai, without a motherland or a future. After the victory of the war, inspired by the greatness of the motherland, they, like repented traitors, turned again to the motherland they had hated for twenty-five years, obtained Soviet citizenship, and rescued themselves, and even more so rescued the younger generation. So these children, who yesterday were still fighting and making trouble on the streets of the slums, will tomorrow become useful citizens of this huge country. Yesterday, their possible future was as thieves, swindlers, drunkards, or at most a coachman or doorman, but tomorrow, the day after they set foot in the Soviet Union, they will become pilots flying in the sky, navigators sailing in the ocean, musicians, and poets.

    On the way back from seeing the ship off, the Soviet expatriate accompanying the reporter was humming the national anthem: "Our motherland is so vast and wide... Here the youth have bright futures..." The reporter saw a group of scabby-headed, snot-nosed beggar children on the side of the street chasing a rice carrier and grabbing food, and could not help but wonder if they still had the issue of a motherland to consider.

　　白俄儿童返回祖国
    ——那儿青年都有远大前程，那儿老人到处受尊敬。
    万歌
    这是一个秋天里的春天，太阳明朗得使人像处身在日暖花香的日子里一样。江海关的码头上，几十个快乐的叫嚷着的孩子，连同着送行的大人，把宽大的码头挤得水泄不通，苏轮斯摩尔奈则像生了根似的稳定的碇泊在浦江的中心。海关的送客轮来了，把这喧嚷的一群送上了那艘泊在远处的大船。机轮击打着江水，小船拍拍的向大船驶去，抵达大船的时候，在“呼拉，斯摩尔奈！呼拉，俄罗斯！”的欢呼声中，五十七个孩子一个个的争相走上那艘大船。一个拖着一条有红缎结的小辫的女孩尼娜，转身向她的母亲问：“妈咪，这是俄罗斯了吗？”周围的人都笑了，她的母亲向她说：“孩子，这还不是俄罗斯，这是俄罗斯的船。”
    记者跨上大船时，货船的甲板上已全是孩子们的天下，秋日的阳光照亮着他们的脸，一阵阵的江风在吹动着他们的头发，即将踏上新大陆的喜悦燃烧着他们的心，配合着船尾上那面红色的镰斧旗，和衬在旗背后那一望无际的蓝天，每个人都会为这充满着和平，希望的景象歌颂的。
    斯摩尔奈是一艘六千五百吨的货轮，是中国和苏联海上交通的桥梁，现在它已成了孩子们的乐园；有的孩子正依着大人在话别，有的正像不肯休息的松鼠似的一会儿爬上甲板，一会儿又钻进了舱底。记者趁此机会随便的在他们中找人谈话。
    第一个是名叫丹娘的女郎，只十七岁，但已长成一个丰满的少女，成熟的身躯中还包着一个稚气的心灵。她告诉我她父亲原在上海开设着猪肠厂，战时给日军占领了，他们便去了青岛，但青岛的住所现在又给美海军征用，于是又回到上海，她便决定去苏联——这她从未见过面的祖国。她的理想是做一个无线电收发报员。
    “你不怕和你的父母分别吗？”记者问：
    她嫣然一笑的说：“不怕，他们也就要去苏联了。”
    第二个名叫卡赛诺夫的孩子告诉我他将到苏联去加入海军，他是在上海出生的，住在虹口，父亲已死，他说他将来要做一个红海军的舰长。
    “你没钱能进海军学校吗？”
    “政府会照顾我的。”他说。
    记者和他握了握手，祝福他的理想实现，然后又转向另外一个名叫克里孟哥的大孩子谈话。他穿着一件皮领的短大衣，显出特别的高大，其实还只十九岁。原来在震旦读工程，这次回去预备学飞行。他的父亲现在上海苏联电台任职，这次老夫妇二人也都来送行的。
    这时，一个头发金黄，穿着工装裤的女孩子走近了记者的身边，她只十五岁，名叫梵兰丁。她正担任着这批孩子中的小队长，带领十个孩子。问起她的志愿，她也说要做无线电收发报员，淡灰色的眼珠中流露出充分的骄傲和自信。
    喧闹的空气中，船栏杆旁却有一个孩子独自在眺望着江边的一只美国兵舰。记者走去和他谈话时，发现他既不能听，又不能说，只能向记者做个鬼脸。一个大人走来告诉记者，他是一个聋哑儿童，但他将不会变成废人，他有着艺术天才，他们决定把他送回去学音乐和绘画。
    又有一个脸型瘦削的孩子，还在他母亲旁边安慰他的母亲，他说他要到苏联去学开飞机，他去过江湾和龙华的飞机场，常在场外看着巨型的飞机降落又飞起。
    “你这样瘦行吗？”
    “我到了苏联就会胖的。”他这样的告诉记者。
    这些孩子的爸妈原先大都是白俄，流落在上海在饥饿线上挣扎，没有祖国，没有前途，战事胜利后，为祖国的伟大所感召，他们像忏悔过了的叛徒似的重又投向仇视了二十五年之久的祖国，取得了苏联的公民籍，他们拯救了自己，更拯救了比他们年轻的一代。于是这昨日还在贫民窟的街头上打架闹事的孩子，在明日便将成为这巨大国家的有用公民；在昨日，他们可能的前途是小偷，骗子，酒鬼，或最多是个车夫或司阍，但明天，在他们踏进了苏联这国家后的明天，他们将成为飞翔于空中的飞行员，将成为航行在大洋中的航海者，将成为音乐家，将成为诗人。
    送船回来的路上，和记者同行的苏侨在哼着：“我们祖国多么辽阔广大………这儿青年都有远大前程……”的祖国进行曲。记者看到街边一群癞痢头拖鼻涕的小乞丐，正在追逐一个包饭担抢饭，便不禁怀疑起他们究竟是否还有着祖国的问题来了。（转载自十月二十三日上海文汇报）
