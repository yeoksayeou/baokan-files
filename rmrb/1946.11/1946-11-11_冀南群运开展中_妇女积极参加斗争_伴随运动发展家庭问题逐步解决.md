    Peasant Movement Unfolds in Southern Hebei
    Women Actively Participate in Struggle
    Family Problems Gradually Resolved with the Development of the Movement
    [This Newspaper, Weixian, 5th dispatch] With the development of the peasant liberation movement, the women's movement in Southern Hebei is flourishing. In the peasant liberation movement in Ningnan, more than 5,000 women were organized to participate in the struggle, and 43 women's associations were established. In Dongwang Town, all women over the age of sixteen have joined the women's association, totaling more than 700 people. In Baixiang, 53 villages have established women's associations, accounting for half of the villages in the county. In the Xia'en district, two-thirds of the villages and 70% of the women are organized. According to statistics from 35 villages in Yongzhi's third district, there are 3,600 women members. In some villages, the number of women members exceeds the number of peasant association members. They participated in the struggle against traitors and landlords, pouring out their deeper suffering, often with tears streaming down their faces, arousing the sympathy and indignation of the masses and strengthening the momentum of the movement. In addition to jointly struggling against the special agent landlord Han Chengxin with the peasant association village, the Baocheng Women's Association also demanded that the wife of Han, who had always oppressed the poor, be detained. Women members said angrily: "In the past, poor people married a wife, and you said they had the smell of poverty; today, we'll let you smell enough of our poor smell." Zhang, a widowed old woman in Zhaoshangdong Village, Baixiang, connected more than 30 women in the struggle to participate in the women's association, leading women members to complain and shout slogans, demonstrating a strong fighting spirit. She not only became a women's leader, but also a peasant leader in the village. In the earth-shaking peasant liberation movement, the broad masses of women were tempered, their awareness was raised, and they demanded the resolution of their own problems. At the end of the mass movement, young and middle-aged women in Zhongniu Village, Xin County, proposed that under the conditions of women's hard work in production, the family should be responsible for clothing, which was discussed by the women's association and then submitted to the peasant association. With the approval of the majority of peasant women members, the issue of clothing has been successfully resolved in the village. In the first district of En County, under the slogans of "Everyone is human, no one oppresses anyone," "The mother-in-law is in charge of clothing, and the daughter-in-law produces more," and "Mother-in-law and daughter-in-law are harmonious, sisters-in-law are harmonious, and sisters-in-law are harmonious," each village is holding "thinking meetings" and "untangling knot meetings" to educate peasants and women and promote family harmony. At present, Ningnan, Baixiang, Xiajin, Yongzhi and other counties are deeply developing the women's movement on the basis of the peasant movement having entered the consolidation stage. The experience of the above-mentioned areas proves that in order to achieve the goal of "organizing more than 90% of the peasants," it is necessary to mobilize and organize women, who account for half of the peasants, to participate in the liberation movement. Furthermore, Guan County has proposed that women participate in leadership, and now one-third to one-half of the women cadres participate in leadership. According to the experience of various places, women are not as strong as men in their ability at the beginning of mobilization, but they will quickly improve after a period of training. Experience has proved that it is problematic to mobilize women solely from production or to carry out women's movement independently. Women's personal problems are mostly problems between families or with peasants, and should be resolved through mediation and education. For example, at the beginning of Xia'en district, it proposed "women should be armed," "equality between men and women, equality between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law," etc., which the peasants could not accept at that time, so they prevented their wives, sisters, etc. from participating in the women's association. This is a lesson from being divorced from the actual peasant movement.

    冀南群运开展中
    妇女积极参加斗争
    伴随运动发展家庭问题逐步解决
    【本报威县五日电】随着农民翻身运动的发展，冀南妇女运动蓬勃开展。宁南在农民翻身运动中，组织了五千余妇女参加斗争，建立了四十三个妇会，该县东汪镇年在十六岁以上的妇女已全部参加妇会，共有七百余人。柏乡有五十三村建立妇会，占全县村庄之半。夏恩沙区三分之二的村庄，百分之七十的妇女组织起来。永智三区卅五村统计妇会员有三千六百人。有的村超过了农会员的数目。她们参加反奸诉苦斗争，吐诉她们更深的痛苦，往往涕泪交流，激起群众的同情与愤恨，壮大运动的声势。保成妇会除与农会村共同斗争了特务地主韩成信外，并要求扣起一向欺压穷人的韩妻。妇会员愤恨的说：“过去穷人娶个媳妇，你说有穷人气，今天叫你闻够俺这穷人味。”柏乡赵上东村孤寡老妇张氏，在斗争中串连卅余名妇女参加妇会，领导妇会员诉苦喊口号，表现了坚强的斗争性。她不但成了妇女领袖，也成了该村农民领袖。广大妇女在翻天覆地的农民翻身运动中，受到锻炼，觉悟提高，要求解决其本身问题。莘县中牛村青壮年妇女，在群运末尾，即提出要求在妇女勤劳生产条件下，家庭管穿，经妇会讨论，后即提交农会。该村对管穿问题，在农妇会员大多数赞同下，已顺利解决。恩县一区在“人都是人，谁也不欺压谁”，“婆婆管穿、媳妇多生产”，“婆媳和睦、妯娌和睦、姑嫂和睦”等口号下，各村都在开“想想会”，“解疙瘩会”，教育了农民及妇女，使家庭和睦。目前宁南、柏乡、夏津、永智等县，在农民运动已进入巩固阶段的基础上，正深入开展妇女运动。以上地区的经验证明，为达到“组织百分之九十以上的农民”的目的，必须发动组织占农民半数的妇女参加翻身运动。而冠县，更提出妇女参加领导，现已有三分之一至二分之一的妇女干部参加领导。根据各地经验，妇女在发动初期，不如男子的能力坚强，但经过一个时期的锻炼，她们会很快进步。经验证明单纯的从生产中发动妇女，或独立的开展妇女运动，都是有问题的。妇女切身的问题多是家庭之间或与农民之间的问题，应调解教育解决。如夏恩沙区起初即提“妇女武装起来”“男女平等、婆媳平等”等，农民当时不能接受，便阻止自己老婆姐妹等参加妇会。这就是脱离实际农民运动的教训。
