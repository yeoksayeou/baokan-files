　　【This newspaper, Weixian, 3rd dispatch】In En County, during the land reform movement, after the majority of the masses had been organized and the personnel who had previously served as puppet soldiers were isolated, a "face-washing" and "removing the traitor hat" movement was carried out to guide these people onto the right path and prevent the evil gentry from using them for sabotage activities. The method used in Da Lizhuang, En County, to carry out this work was: first, isolate the people who had been puppet bandits among the masses, making them feel they had no status. If someone who had been a puppet bandit walked down the street, no one would pay attention to them; if they joined a crowd, everyone would scatter; when distributing fruit, they had a share, but it was temporarily kept by the Farmers' Association; if they asked to join the Farmers' Association, the masses would refuse. Under these circumstances, all those who had been puppet soldiers were gathered together and told, "According to the bad things you did in the past, the masses will not forgive you; but considering that you are also poor people, we are all poor brothers; therefore, we both hate you and pity you. What do you think we should do?" From one side reprimanding and the other striving, inspire them to "remove their hats." Later, a village meeting was held to allow them to confess to the masses voluntarily. The masses did not express their attitude on the spot regarding the quality of the confession. After each report was completed, the recorder read out the facts confessed to the masses one by one, and then discussed in groups, with the masses circling to indicate "removal" and dotting to indicate that the confession was insufficient. Finally, the Farmers' Association compiled the statistics and announced them to everyone. In this way, fifteen traitor hats were removed in the first time out of twenty-five people, six were removed the second time, and the last four were removed only after three attempts. This made them confess some things that the masses could not have imagined. After the traitors removed their hats, they swore: "If I have three hearts and two minds with the Farmers' Association, may I be struck by lightning!" "If I don't follow the Farmers' Association, I am not a Chinese!" "I vow never to be a lackey for traitors, bullies, and landlords!" The puppet bandits who have gone through "hat removal" are now standing tall and starting production, feeling that they have been reborn.

　　恩县在土地改革运动中
    群众帮伪人员“摘帽”
    【本报威县三日电】恩县在土地改革运动中，当大多数群众已组织起来后，而过去当过伪军的人员受到孤立的时候，进行了一次“洗脸”与“摘汉奸帽”运动，以便使这些人走向正路，并防止奸霸利用他们进行破坏活动。恩县大李庄进行这一工作的办法是：先将当过伪匪的人在群众中间孤立起来，使其感到没地位。当过伪匪的在街上走没人理，往人群里一凑大家一哄而散，分果实时有他们的份儿，但由农会暂时保存，要求入农会，群众不要；在这种情况下，将所有当过伪军的集中起来，向其讲明，“按你们过去办的坏事，群众不原谅你们；但念你们也是穷人，咱们都是穷弟兄；所以，心里又恨你们，又怜惜你们，你们想想怎么办？”从一面责斥，一面争取中，启发其“摘帽”要求。以后，再开村民大会，让他们自动向群众坦白。坦白的好坏，群众当场不表示态度。待一个个报告完结，记录将其坦白的事实向群众一一宣读，然后分组讨论，由群众进行画圈点点，画圈的表示可以“摘下”，点点的表示坦白的不够。最后由农会统计出来，向大家公布。这样在二十五人中，第一次就摘下十五个汉奸帽，第二次摘掉了六个，最后的四个摘了三次才摘掉。这样就使得他们将一些群众所想像不到的事都坦白出来了。汉奸摘帽后，宣誓说：“我要和农会有三心二意，天打雷轰！”“我要不跟着农会走，不是中国人种”！“我誓死不为汉奸恶霸地主当狗腿子！”经过“摘帽”的伪匪，现在都已挺起胸脯，开始进行生产，觉得自己已经新生了。
