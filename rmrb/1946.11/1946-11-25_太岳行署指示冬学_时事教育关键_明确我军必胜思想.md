　　Taiyue Administrative Office Issues Instructions on Winter School
    Key to Current Affairs Education
    ——Clarifying the Idea of Our Army's Inevitable Victory
    [Report from Taiyue, 19th of this month] The Taiyue Administrative Office recently issued instructions to arrange this winter's winter school work. It first pointed out that the task of this winter's winter school is mainly to support and guarantee the victory of the patriotic self-defense war. It should focus on current affairs education, emancipation education, and connect with production education. Current affairs education should first break the illusion of peace, clearly recognize the essence of the US replacing Japan and Chiang replacing Wang, as well as Chiang Kai-shek's selling out the country and waging civil war. It should recognize the comparison and changes in the strength of the enemy and ourselves, and that the current key to the war is not in the gain or loss of a single city or place, but in eliminating the enemy's active forces, as well as the principle that Chiang is bound to be defeated and we are bound to win, in order to enhance confidence in victory and overcome pessimistic emotions. It should be linked to carrying out the movement for the US military to withdraw from China and the movement not to buy American goods. Emancipation education should be combined with the implementation of "land to the tiller," and production education should focus on checking and summarizing this year's production to promote winter production, educating the masses to carry out textile transportation and cooperatives, and preparing for next year's large-scale production. Cultural education should focus on literacy for young men and women. In addition, they can learn abacus, hygiene, etc. according to the needs of the masses. Regarding the organization and leadership of the winter school, it must be combined with the current central work. The central work should be publicized and educated in the winter school. Each county and district should make a research plan for the winter school and the central work and carry them out together. The principle of voluntarism and need should be adhered to, and teach whatever the masses need. The organizational form and teaching methods of the winter school must be adapted to the living habits and production organization principles of the masses, and strive to minimize missed work. Advocate mutual teaching and mutual learning, regardless of form. The instructions finally pointed out that the winter school work should be arranged, inspected, and summarized in a timely manner, and attention should be paid to discovering typical examples, cultivating typical examples, and circulating commendations to promote the general. At the end of the winter school period, learning models and model winter school voluntary teachers can be elected and commended.
