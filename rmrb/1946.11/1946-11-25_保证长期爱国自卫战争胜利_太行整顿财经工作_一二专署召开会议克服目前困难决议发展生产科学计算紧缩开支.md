　　To Guarantee Victory in the Long-Term Patriotic Self-Defense War
    Taihang Rectifies Financial and Economic Work
    First and Second Special Districts Hold Meetings to Overcome Current Difficulties, Resolve to Develop Production, Scientifically Calculate, and Curtail Expenditures
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] After summarizing the past economic and financial work, the Taihang First and Second Special Districts clarified that the future direction of financial and economic work is to serve the victory of the self-defense war, guarantee military needs, and take care of the people's food. Under this principle, it is necessary to develop production, prosper the economy, scientifically use manpower, and curtail local expenditures. Last month, the Taihang First and Second Special Districts separately held economic work and financial grain work meetings. It is undeniable that great achievements have been made in the past half year of financial and economic work. However, due to insufficient assessment of the peaceful situation, the economic policy of developing production and self-sufficiency has been relaxed, resulting in serious and unnecessary economic difficulties in the area, as well as chaotic expenditures and waste of manpower in finance. In order to support the long-term self-defense war and overcome financial difficulties, under the principle of ensuring military needs and taking care of the people's food, the future financial and economic policy is to develop production, scientifically use manpower, and curtail local expenditures. How to implement this policy was decided at the financial and economic meeting, roughly as follows: First, regarding the development of production and economic prosperity: First, improve agricultural production, with the direction of combining agriculture and sideline industries, promoting improved varieties, special crops, and improving technology. Secondly, vigorously develop and consolidate cooperatives, with the direction of greatly developing the textile movement this winter, developing the transportation industry, and organizing all handicrafts, industry, and mining. Thirdly, strengthen trade work. Second, regarding the scientific use of manpower, the main thing is to improve rear service work. Erzhuan Commissioner Fan and Sun pointed out the use of manpower: 1. It must be scientific and organized, that is, scientific calculation, organization of echelons, rotation, strict support for difference and hiring feet, establishing the concept of participation in the war, and eliminating the idea of allocation difference; 2. Rest stations and transportation lines must be prepared regularly; 3. Local areas should take the initiative to find the army and jointly plan and organize the use of manpower; 4. Promote and create the experience of combining labor and military, and further organize auxiliary labor to participate in production and rear service. Third, regarding curtailing local expenditures, the experience of Wuxiang and Heshun proves that: first, unnecessary expenditures such as construction fees, reserve fees, training fees, relief grain after land reform, preferential resistance grain, etc., can be greatly reduced; second, organize indirect income, and manage the previously neglected transaction fees, deed fees, livestock fees, and local unified cumulative taxes, etc., which can increase considerable income; third, clean up finances, and thoroughly clean up phenomena such as corruption and waste, random spending and borrowing, and rotten grain in warehouses. Starting from the above three aspects, the two counties can completely avoid directly collecting from the masses in the thirty-sixth year, and Heshun still has a surplus. The Second Special District also decided to promote the example of Licheng, Xiangyuan, Yushe and other counties in solving local expenditures from production investment. On the issue of tidying up finances and curtailing local expenditures, the First and Second Special Districts called on all cadres to overcome the view that financial work "has nothing," conduct in-depth inspections, implement tidying up, in order to achieve the goal of reducing the people's burden and supporting the long-term patriotic self-defense war until the final victory.

　　保证长期爱国自卫战争胜利
    太行整顿财经工作
    一二专署召开会议克服目前困难决议发展生产科学计算紧缩开支
    【本报特讯】太行一、二专署总结过去经济与财政工作后，明确今后财经工作方向是在一切为了自卫战争的胜利，保证军需，照顾民食的原则下，必须发展生产，繁荣经济；科学使用民力；紧缩地方开支。上月太行一、二专署分别召开经济工作与财粮工作会议，总结过去多半年来财经工作，不可否认的获得了伟大成绩，但由于对和平形势估计不足，经济上放松了发展生产、自给自足的政策，致使该区经济遭受严重的不必要的困难；在财政上发生开支混乱，浪费民力现象。为支持长期自卫战争，克服财经困难、在保证军需照顾民食的原则下，今后财经方针是发展生产，科学使用民力，紧缩地方开支。如何施行这个方针，财经会议作出决定，大略如下：第一、关于发展生产，繁荣经济。首先提高农业生产，其方向是农副业结合，推广优良品种、特种作物和提高技术三个环节。其次，大力开展与巩固合作社，其方向是今冬大大开展纺织运动，发展运输事业，并组织一切手工业、工矿业。再次是加强贸易工作。第二、关于科学使用民力，主要是改进后方工作，二专署樊孙二专员指出使用民力：一、要科学化、组织化。即科学计算，组织梯队，轮番使用，严格支差雇脚，树立参战观念，去掉拨差思想；二、休息站，运输线，要经常准备妥当；三、地方上要主动找军队，共同计划组织使用民力；四、发扬与创造劳武结合的经验，更进一步组织辅助劳动力；参加生产和后方勤务。第三，关于紧缩地方开支，武乡和顺经验证明，一则不必要的开支如建设费、预备费、训练费，以土地改革后，救济粮，优抗粮等等，均能大大紧缩；二则组织间接收入，将过去忽视的交易费、契纸费、牲畜费及地方统累税等等加以管理，可增加不少收入；三则清理财政，对于贪污浪费、乱支乱借及仓库烂粮等现象，彻底清理。从以上三方面着手，该二县在三十六年度可以完全不向群众直接征收，而和顺尚有剩余。二专署并决定发扬黎城、襄垣、榆社等县从生产投资中解决地方开支的范例。在整理财政紧缩地方开支这个问题上，一、二专署号召全体干部克服财政工作“没有什么”的观点，深入检查，贯彻整理，以求达到减轻人民负担，支持长期爱国自卫战争直到最后胜利。
