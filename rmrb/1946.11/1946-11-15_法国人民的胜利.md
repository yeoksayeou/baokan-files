    The Victory of the French People
    *Liberation Daily* Editorial, November 12th
    The election of the first post-war National Assembly of France has concluded. According to near-final statistics, the French Communist Party (PCF) has emerged as the leading party, securing 5,470,000 votes and 168 seats. Including the five seats won by the Resistance Movement affiliated with the Communists, the total is 173 seats, exceeding the number of seats the party held in the first Constituent Assembly a year ago, and surpassing the number obtained by any party in the past two provisional assemblies. This is an unprecedented victory for the French people and a new triumph for the world democratic movement.

    Why was the French Communist Party elected as the leading party? This is because the PCF has consistently fought tirelessly for the interests of the people for many years. During the war, it was the most heroic and well-organized vanguard in upholding the anti-German resistance movement. After the war, it unyieldingly insisted on a democratic new constitution, advocated for the nationalization of large enterprises, and made significant contributions to economic recovery, thereby gaining the love and respect of the broad masses of the people. In the past decade, the number of PCF members has increased to 1.2 million today, and the number of voters has risen from 1.5 million to 5.47 million. The three major French mass organizations, including the General Confederation of Labor with 5 million members, the Women's League with 1 million members, and the Republican Youth League with 300,000 members, are all under its leadership. Its official newspaper, *L'Humanité*, and local newspapers sell 2 million copies daily. For such a strong mass party wholeheartedly serving the people, the reactionaries tried their best to spread rumors and slander during the election in an attempt to weaken the PCF's prestige, but these attempts failed. The strength of the PCF and its prestige among the people are growing day by day. The three elections in the past year fully demonstrate that the French Communist Party stands at the forefront of the French people's democratic movement, relies closely on the people, and moves forward, which no reactionaries can stop.

    In contrast to the PCF, the number of seats of the other two major parties decreased in this election compared to the previous one. The Socialist Party suffered the most significant decrease, falling from 125 seats to 93 seats. This is because the party's leading organs, under the control of the right wing, were wavering and vacillating, and colluded with the right-wing parties of the big bourgeoisie, thereby causing a split within the Socialist Party, leading left-wing voters to switch their votes to the PCF, while some conservatives went to vote for the right-wing parties. As for the Popular Republican Movement (MRP), the party failed to solve the serious financial difficulties in the government, advocated revising the new constitution, and colluded with the de Gaulle faction. Therefore, many voters abandoned the party in this election. Although the party had the full support of conservatives, it also lost more than 550,000 votes compared to the previous election. These facts show that although the above two parties occupied a considerable number of seats in the previous two assemblies, they declined once their policies failed to meet the demands of the masses and even violated the interests of the French people.

    During this French election campaign, the internal reactionaries and international reactionary forces tried every possible means to hinder the development of the French democratic movement. The French right-wing parties attempted to form an alliance to打击(dǎjī, strike) the French Communist Party and democratic progressive forces. American imperialist elements even threatened to cancel loans to France to prevent the French people from leaning to the left. However, the French people were not intimidated. Over the past year, the French political situation has been turbulent, with twists and turns, three elections, and two referendums, finally culminating in the PCF regaining the leading party position in the parliament in this election. This is not only a major blow to the French reactionaries but also a powerful blow to the American imperialist policy of supporting reactionary forces everywhere and suppressing democratic forces around the world. This will not only greatly benefit France's democratic construction and economic recovery in the next five years, but also the relations between major powers will be affected by France's leftward turn. Of course, this does not mean that the future of the French political situation will be smooth sailing from now on. It should be pointed out that the reactionaries will still desperately carry out sabotage activities. The right-wing parties have seen some growth in this election, and there are still many difficulties in the further democratization of France. However, as long as the French people, led by the PCF, the Socialist Party, and progressive people, strengthen unity and cooperation, and make persistent efforts, victory is entirely assured.

    The French general election once again confirms Chairman Mao's prediction made when the world anti-fascist war had not yet ended: "The people will win the war, win the peace, and win progress." The French people have already "won the war and won the peace," and they will inevitably "win progress," which is beyond doubt. The victory of the French people in the general election once again demonstrates that the world is progressing, which greatly encourages our people's struggle against civil war, against dictatorship, and against national betrayal. We believe that the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries will inevitably be unable to resist the Chinese people's march towards the goal of independence, freedom, and democracy, just like the French reactionaries. The American imperialist policy of assisting Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial civil war is also destined to fail, just like its interference in the French general election.

    法国人民的胜利
    解放日报十二日社论
    战后法国第一届国民议会的选举结束了。据接近最后统计，显示法国共产党已争得首席，得五百四十七万票一百六十八席，连接近共产党的抵抗运动五席，合计一百七十三席，超过了一年前第一届立宪议会时该党的席位，也超过过去两届临时议会中任何一党所获得的席位。这是法国人民的空前胜利，也是世界民主运动的新的捷音。
    法国共产党为什么当选为第一党呢？这是因为法国共产党多年来为人民利益奋斗不懈，在战争中是坚持抗德运动的最英勇最有组织的先锋队，在战后不屈不挠地坚持民主化的新宪法，主张大企业国有，并对经济恢复作了重大贡献，从而获得了广大人民的爱戴。在过去十年中，法共党员增至今天的一百二十万，选民从一百五十万增至五百四十七万。法国三大群众团体并拥有五百万会员的劳工总同盟，一百万会员的妇女联盟，以及三十万会员的青年共和主义团均在其领导之下，它的机关报人道报及地方报纸日销二百万份。对于这样一个全心全意为人民服务坚强的群众性的政党，反动派在竞选中曾尽力造谣诽谤，企图减弱法共的威信，但是这些企图都失败了。法共的力量和其在人民中的威信天天增长，过去一年中的三次选举，充分的证明法国共产党站在法国人民民主运动的最前列，紧紧的依靠人民迈步前进，决不是任何反动派所能阻止住的。
    与法共相反在这次选举中，其他两大党的席位都比上届减少了。社会党减少最多，从一二五席跌至九十三席，这是由于该党领导机关在右派把持之下动摇不定，并与大资产阶级右翼各党互通声气，从而引起了社会党内部的分化，使选民中的左翼分子转而投法共的票，而若干保守分子则去投右派各党的票。至于人民共和运动党，该党在政府中未能解决严重的财政困难，并主张修改新宪，还与戴高乐派勾结，故不少选民在这次选举中抛弃了该党，该党虽有保守分子的全力支持，然亦比上届失去五十五万余票。这些事实表明上述两党虽曾在上两届议会中占有相当多的议席，但一旦他们的政策不能满足群众的要求以至于违反法国人民利益时，即往下降了。
    在此次法国选举运动中法国内部反动派与国际上反动势力，想尽办法企图阻扰法国民主运动的发展，法国各右翼党派曾拟结成联盟打击法国共产党及民主进步力量，美国帝国主义分子甚至以取消对法贷款来威胁法国人民不要左倾，但是法国人民并没有被吓倒。一年来法国政局波澜起伏迂回曲折，三次选举两次复决，终以这次法共重获议会首席党而告一段落，这不仅给法国反动派的一个重大打击，而且也给美帝国主义在世界各地到处扶植反动势力压迫民主势力的干涉政策的一个有力的打击。这不仅对于今后五年中法国的民主建设与经济复兴大有裨益，而且各大强国的关系亦将受法国左倾的影响。自然这并不是说法国政局的前途从此便一帆风顺了，应当指出反动派还要拚命进行破坏活动。右翼各派在这次选举中有某些增长，法国的进一步的民主化尚有不少困难。但是只要法国人民以法共及社会党和进步人士为首加强团结合作，再接再厉，胜利是完全有把握的。
    法国大选再一次的证实毛主席在世界反法西斯战争尚未结束的时候所作的预言：“人民将要赢得战争赢得和平又赢得进步”，法国人民已经“赢得战争赢得和平”，他必然要“赢得进步”，这是毫无疑义的。法国人民在大选中的胜利，再次表现世界在进步中，这大大鼓舞了我国人民反对内战反对独裁反对卖国的斗争。我们相信蒋介石反动派必然将像法国反动派一样抵挡不住中国人民向独立自由民主的目标迈步前进，美国帝国主义之援助蒋介石独裁内战的政策，也必然像它干涉法国大选一样，是注定要失败的。
