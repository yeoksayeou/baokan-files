Taihang First Military Sub-district
Training County and District Armed Forces Committee Directors
Improve Skills and Prepare for Winter Military Training

[This newspaper's dispatch] In order to thoroughly eliminate和平幻想 [unrealistic illusions about peace], enhance combat will and skills, the Taihang First Military Sub-district recently held a special training session for the directors of the Armed Forces Committees of Zanhhuang, Lincheng, Neiqiu, Xingtai, and Shahe counties and districts. The ideological review revealed the following problems: Some cadres in Shahe believed, "We are far away from the enemy on both sides, so it doesn't matter!" A certain district director wanted to return home because he saw that his land was not being cultivated well, and the lives of the village cadres and the masses had greatly improved after liberation, so he wanted to demobilize and return home. Some cadres were afraid of working in border areas, afraid of hardship, and afraid of sacrifice. Some cadres continued to hold on to the hedonistic ideas that arose after the counter-offensive victory, were not at ease in their work, and wanted to eat and dress better. Some cadres were ideologically entangled in divorce and marriage issues, and even individual cadres engaged in corruption and degeneration. Some cadres disliked the low status of the Armed Forces Committee work and wanted to transfer to other jobs. The staff officer of Zanhuang believed that his transfer from the regular army to the local armed forces was a demotion, etc. After the review, the leadership immediately pointed out that all the above-mentioned ideas stemmed from paralysis and和平幻想 [unrealistic illusions about peace] regarding the current war situation, which had greatly corroded the will to fight, and that they should respond to the call of the Central Committee and immediately and thoroughly eliminate them. Therefore, everyone combined current affairs study and launched a deep self-criticism, eliminating和平幻想 [unrealistic illusions about peace]. Everyone unanimously recognized: "Only with full preparation can we not be afraid of the enemy's attack," "Fighting Chiang Kai-shek is for the sake of the family being able to live a good life, and only through hard struggle, not being afraid of sacrifice, and winning the victory of the self-defense war can personal peace and happiness be achieved," and "Armed work is the most important work at present, and being an armed cadre is to make contributions to the people, and it is the glory of the Party and oneself." After the study, everyone's fighting spirit was greatly enhanced. Immediately afterwards, a military training movement was launched, and the slogans "Armed Forces Committee cadres should all learn the three military skills of shooting, grenade throwing, and demolition" and "Launch a winter militia training movement" were put forward. In the military training, everyone coached each other, learned from each other, and studied various methods of using and laying landmines, and learned to set up various landmine formations. After research and practice, shooting and grenade throwing skills have been greatly improved. In terms of leading troops, the political work, military management, and combat command experience of leading the militia to participate in the war since the counter-offensive were summarized. Coaching methods that combined formal training with squad and platoon offensives and defenses, as well as tactical exercises, were studied. Finally, everyone proposed that in addition to actively leading the militia to launch a military training and self-study movement after returning, they should also study in the militia, continuously improve their military skills, and prepare to go to the self-defense front at any time.

    集训县区武委会主任
    提高技术准备开展冬季练武
    【本报讯】为彻底肃清和平幻想，提高战斗意志及技术，太行一分区最近特集训赞皇、临城、内邱、邢台、沙河等五县县区武委会主任。在思想检查中发现以下几个问题：沙河部分干部认为：“咱这儿两边离敌人都远，还不要紧！”某区主任因回家见自己的地代耕得不好，而村干部群众翻身后生活都大为提高，遂想复员回家。有的干部怕到边地工作、怕艰苦、怕牺牲。有的干部还继续着反攻胜利后产生的享乐主义思想，工作不安心，想吃好些，穿好些。有的干部思想纠缠于离婚结婚问题，甚至个别干部有腐化堕落行为。有的干部嫌武委会工作地位低想转业，赞皇参谋组长认为自己从正规军到地方武装是降低了地位等。检查后领导上当即指出以上各种思想都从对目前战局麻痹和和平幻想所产生，曾大大的腐蚀了战斗意志，应响应中央号召，立即彻底肃清。于是大家就结合时事学习，展开了深刻的自我批评，肃清了和平幻想。一致认识了：“要有充分准备才不怕敌人进攻，”“打蒋贼就是为了家庭能过好日子，只有艰苦奋斗，不怕牺牲，取得自卫战争胜利，个人和平幸福生活才能得到”以及“武装工作是目前头等重要的工作，当武装干部为人民建功劳，党与自己的光荣。”学习后大家斗争情绪顿形昂扬。紧接着就展开了练武运动，并提出了“武委会干部人人学会射击、投弹、爆炸三人军事技术”，“开展冬季民兵练武运动”的口号。在练武中大家互相教练，互相学习，研究了各种地雷使用法，埋设法，学会了摆各种地雷阵。经过研究和实习，射击和投弹技术已大为提高。在带兵上，总结了反攻以来领导民兵参战的政治工作和军事管理、作战指挥等经验。并研究了制式教练的班排进攻，防御要和战术演习结合起来的教练方法。最后大家都提出回去后除积极领导民兵展开练武自学运动外，并且还要在民兵中学习，不断提高自己的军事技术，准备随时开赴自卫前线。
