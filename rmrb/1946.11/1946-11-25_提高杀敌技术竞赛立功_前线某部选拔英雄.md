　　Under the new heroism movement, the 6016 unit of the Eighth Route Army on the Jilu-Yu front, utilizing the lulls in the war, convened a heroes' meeting. Amidst the rumbling of cannons, the meeting, spanning three days (9th, 10th, and 11th), has victoriously concluded. At the opening of the conference on the 9th, the unit's leaders pointed out: "Today's meeting is a conference of the most outstanding figures in the cause of people's liberation. We will also select outstanding heroes who have gloriously sacrificed or been wounded in battle, and present awards to the hospitals and the martyrs' families." It was also pointed out that the unit's completion of several arduous combat missions in Lanfeng, Baimaoji, Dayanghu, Sun Guancun, etc., is inseparable from every comrade present. It is hoped that every hero and model will, from now on, highly promote new heroism, do everything possible to improve their skills, and render more meritorious service to the people in the self-defense war. On the second and third days, a forum was held, with over a hundred heroes and models warmly discussing tactics, techniques, and other issues. Each hero embraced the spirit of mutual learning and self-improvement. Unit leaders also personally attended and provided guidance. Following the forum, a formal election was held. The heroes, with radiant faces, stood on the stage, humbly reporting their heroic deeds. As a result, over ten heroes, including model company commander Qiao Fakuan, machine gunner Zheng Guitang, machine gun squad leader Wang Yongzhou, reconnaissance hero Duan Haiqing, and engineer hero Li Zhaotang, were officially elected.
