　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 6th: According to dispatches from the Associated Press in Washington on the 3rd and 4th: Certain high-ranking government officials have predicted that the United States will enter an economic depression in 1947. They are urging a large expansion of public works programs and that banks compress loans to cope with the arrival of this dark time. At the same time, most economists in Washington seem to feel that there will be at least one economic reversal in 1947. Note: The American bourgeoisie has exaggerated the social purchasing power accumulated during the war and the need for products in peacetime, thus propagating that there will be a huge economic boom after the war, attempting to cover up its inevitable fate of economic depression. In fact, half of the savings of the American people have been used for necessities. Another 24 percent have no savings to speak of, and the savings of the remaining 6 percent are also insignificant. Although the remaining 20 percent own 77 percent of the savings, they cannot consume much after all, while the United States' wartime productivity has increased by 40 percent. Therefore, it can be predicted that the arrival of an economic crisis is not far off.

　　华府某高级官员预示
    美明年将经济萧条
    【新华社延安六日电】据美联社华府三四两日电讯：某些政府高级官员已预示一九四七年美国将进入经济萧条，而敦促大大扩展公共工程计划，及银行压缩借款，以应付此黑暗时机之到来。同时，华盛顿大部分经济学家，似乎觉得一九四七年，至少有一个经济逆转。按；美国资产阶级曾夸大战时积累下来的社会购买力与和平时期产品的需要，因而宣传战后经济将有巨大繁荣，企图掩盖其必然到来的经济萧条之命运，实则美国半数人民所有储蓄已因生活必需而动用掉了。而另有百分之二十四则并无储蓄可言，其余百分之六所有储蓄，亦微不足道。其余百分之二十的人，虽拥有百分之七十七的储蓄，但他们究竟消费不了多少，而美国战时生产力却增大了百分之四十，所以可以预料经济危机的到来，为日不远了。
