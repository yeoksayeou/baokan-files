    [Report from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Frontline, 20th] The guerrilla corps of the Fifth Military Sub-district is now actively cooperating with the main forces on the front lines. One small guerrilla unit alone killed 37 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers and captured 61 alive (including a Chiang Kai-shek army camp quartermaster and a platoon leader) in October. At the end of last month, when the Juan (cheng) City campaign began, the guerrilla corps took the initiative to attack Chiang Kai-shek's troops on the He (ze)-Juan (cheng) highway. In the battle of Macun (35 li north of Heze City) on the 30th, they captured 41 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers, including a platoon leader, and seized one machine gun and two grenade launchers. Due to their active operations, the vast area between He (ze) and Cao (xian) has maintained good democratic order to this day.
