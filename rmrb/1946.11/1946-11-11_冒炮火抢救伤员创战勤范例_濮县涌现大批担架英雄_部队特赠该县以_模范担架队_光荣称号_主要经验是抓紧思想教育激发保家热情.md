[This newspaper's dispatch from the Ji-Lu-Yu region on the 9th] During the battles of Zhangfengji and Longwangji on the Ju-He Highway, the Puyang County stretcher team successfully completed its mission and created many heroic model deeds, thus winning the慰问 (consolation) and praise of the troops, and the commendation of the Second Military Subdistrict Headquarters. Among the seven districts in the county, the Third District was the model of models, winning the first prize. The reason why the Puyang County stretcher team was able to achieve such great results was that the leadership had focused on the ideological education of the masses in advance. Before mobilizing the stretcher bearers, they first convened a meeting in the county of the masses, military families, gentry, families of pseudo-stubborn elements and fugitive landlords, and primary school teachers, etc., to carry out extensive publicity and education; and organized the teacher training class into a propaganda team to go to the countryside for in-depth publicity. In particular, they mobilized stretcher bearers who had returned from the front line to tell people everywhere about the atrocities of rape, arson, and murder committed by the Chiang Kai-shek army that they had witnessed with their own eyes. In this way, the masses all understood that if Chiang Kai-shek attacked, our home would be gone, arousing everyone's enthusiasm for defending their homes and defending themselves, and crushing the rumors and sabotage of bad elements. As a result, everyone actively and voluntarily went to carry stretchers. The entire county also seized the time to solve the land problem and organized wheat planting, dispelling their worries about going to the front line. Therefore, after they arrived at the front, they immediately launched a competition. After the stretcher team of the First District arrived at a certain unit, they immediately challenged other districts at the stretcher militia conference of that unit. Then the First and Third Districts also proposed a competition with the Fourth and Seventh Districts, which further stimulated everyone's emotions and produced a large number of models and heroes. Zu Jiancheng, the leader of the first squadron of the Third District, led five stretchers across the river to rescue the wounded under the condition that the enemy was only half a mile away and machine guns were sweeping like rain. They followed the army for twelve days, eight days of which were battles, and sometimes they went to carry stretchers three or four times in a row, but they successfully completed their mission. Yu Qingyuan from the third squadron of the Third District, who was a stretcher hero in the previous Dayang Lake battle, carried three wounded on his back in one night this time. Yang Bingnan from the third squadron of the Seventh District carried stretchers three times in two days while ill, and even covered the wounded with his own cotton coat. Huang Guoxi from the fourth squadron of the Fifth District did not go back when his wedding date arrived, and he insisted on completing his mission. Doctor Shang Xiangwen brought his own medicines to the front line to take care of the wounded and stretcher bearers, and saw eighty people in one day, so busy that he didn't even eat. Doctor Huang Qingwen from the Sixth District was busy treating the wounded as soon as he recovered from his illness. These heroes and model figures all received certificates of merit and were慰问ed (comforted) and rewarded by a certain unit. A certain brigade they served specially sent a prize banner and wrote a letter of慰问 (condolences), which read: "...Especially the stretcher team of the Third District, their morale is always high, they take good care of the wounded, and their mass discipline is also very good, and they can complete all tasks, big and small. Since the Longhai Campaign several months ago, we have not seen many stretcher teams like the one in Puyang County. We think that the honorary title of model stretcher team is very appropriate to add to their heads. We would like to express our warmest respect and pay our highest respects to everyone!" The Second Military Subdistrict also awarded 235 boxes of cigarettes, and specially sent Director Chen to慰问 (express sympathy), and the county headquarters also awarded 90 boxes of cigarettes and several prize banners. At the summary meeting, all the stretcher bearers unanimously elected the Third District as the first-class model, awarding a large banner, and the Seventh and First Districts were elected as the second and third-class models respectively. Among the nine squadrons in the county, the first squadron of Zu Jiancheng in the Third District was an extra-class model. At the meeting, Yu Qingyuan, Yang Bingnan, Huang Guoxi and other eighty people were selected as stretcher heroes, and each person received a certificate of merit in addition to a prize. After receiving the prizes and prize banners, they all felt that it was an unparalleled honor, and everyone excitedly said: "Next time, we will strive to be models again!"

    濮县涌现大批担架英雄
    部队特赠该县以“模范担架队”光荣称号
    主要经验是抓紧思想教育激发保家热情
    【本报冀鲁豫九日电】在巨荷公路张凤集和龙＠集的战斗中，濮县担架队圆满的完成了任务，并创造了许多英勇的模范事迹，因而博得了部队的慰问、嘉奖，及二分区指挥部的表扬。而在全县七个区中，三区又是模范中的模范，荣获第一等奖。濮县的担架队所以能获得如此大的成绩，是由于领导上事先抓紧了对群众的思想教育。他们在动员担架之前，首先在县里召开了群众、军属、士绅、伪顽家属与逃亡地主家属，及小学教员等会，开展了广泛的宣传教育；并把教员训练班组织成宣传队，下乡深入宣传。特别是动员从前线回来的担架队员，把他们在前线亲眼看到的蒋军奸淫烧杀的暴行到处向人讲述。这样，使群众都了解蒋介石打过来，咱的家就没了，激起大家保家自卫的热情，打垮坏分子的造谣破坏，于是，大家都积极的自愿去抬担架了。全县并抓紧时间解决了土地问题，组织了种麦，解除了他们上前线的顾虑，所以，他们到达前方后，马上就掀起了竞赛。一区的担架队到了某部后，立地便在该部担架民兵大会上，向别的区挑战，接着一、三区也和四、七区提出竞赛，这就更加激发了大家的情绪，涌现出大批的模范和英雄。三区一中队长祖建成，在离敌人只半里地，机枪扫射像下雨一样的情形下，带领五付担架过河去抢伤员。他们随军十二天，八天有战斗，有时一连就去抬三四趟，可是他们胜利完成了任务。三区三分队的于清源，他是上次大杨湖战斗的担架英雄，这回一个夜里就背下三个伤员。七区三分队杨柄南，带着病两天抬了三趟，还把自己的袄给伤员盖上。五区四分队黄国喜，到了结婚日期不回去，他坚持要完成任务。商相文医生自己带着药品到前线看护伤员和担架员，一天内就看了八十个人，忙的连饭都不吃。六区的黄庆文医生，自己病刚好就忙着给伤员看病。这些英雄和模范人物，他们都得了功劳证，受到了某部的慰问和嘉奖。他们服务的某旅特送去奖旗一面，并写信慰问，信里面这样写着：“……特别三区担架队，情绪始终高涨，爱护伤员，群众纪律也很好，大小任务都能完成。自陇海战役数月以来，像濮县这样担架我们还不多见，模范担架队这个光荣称号，加在他们头上，我们认为很恰当。我们特向大家表示十二万分的敬意并致崇高的敬礼！”二分区也奖给纸烟二百三十五盒，还特派陈科长亲往慰问，县指挥部亦奖烟九十盒及奖旗数面。在总结大会上，全体担架队员一致选举三区为一等模范，奖大旗一面，七、一两区分别当选二、三等模范。在全县九个中队中，以三区祖建成的一中队为超等模范。大会上并选出于清源、杨柄南、黄国喜等八十名为担架英雄，每人除得到奖品外，并分别给予功劳证。他们得到奖品及奖旗后，都认为是无尚的光荣，大家都兴奋的说：“下次来，还要争模范！”
