    Eliminating Remnant Armed Forces of the Enemy and Puppets
    Gao Tang Carries Out Anti-Traitor Liquidation
    Overturned Leaders Emerge in the Sixth District of Yongnian
    [This newspaper's dispatch from Weixian on the 14th] The newly recovered area of Gao Tang is vigorously carrying out an anti-traitor liquidation movement. The movement focuses on the South Gate of the urban area. After half a month of vigorous mobilization, the fake peasant association of traitorous landlords was transformed, and Du Fangzhou, who controlled the village administration and suppressed the masses, was overthrown. The peasant association has grown from forty to sixty-five people, and the hired workers' association has also grown to eleven people. Then, the traitorous assets of Bai Shaoyan were liquidated. The strength of the masses is growing. Now, peasant associations have been established in the East, West, and South Gates, and the number of peasant members in the entire urban area has reached 350. A total of eleven struggles have taken place in various streets, obtaining 320,000 yuan in compensation, 17,000 catties of cotton, and 140 mu of land. Most poor peasants have received more than 100 catties of cotton. In particular, forty military families, under the care of the masses, have received even more fruits. The movement has tempered and raised the awareness of the masses, and more than 20 activists and mass leaders have emerged. In order to unify the leadership of the mass movement in the urban area, an urban area committee has been organized to lead the masses in the entire city to continue to carry out more in-depth anti-traitor and grievance-telling struggles. Recently, at a struggle meeting of more than 3,500 people, Ma Qinghan, the puppet street chief who relied on the enemy and puppets to kill the people, was overthrown. Dozens of victims poured out eight years of bitterness. More than 3,000 people shouted in a high voice, "If you have grievances, speak your grievances; if you have revenge, take your revenge." Under the pressure of the broad masses, the murderer Ma has already bowed his head. After the struggle meeting, the masses were extremely excited and happy. Now, each group is discussing how to deal with Ma, and enthusiastically discussing expanding the militia, defending their struggle fruits, defending their hometown, and attacking the Zheng Xiechen miscellaneous regiment of bandits and secret agents.
    [This newspaper reports] Li Hailin is from Louli Village in the Sixth District of Yongnian. He worked as a laborer since he was a child, his family did not own a single piece of land, and his life was very difficult. After the Eighth Route Army liberated Luoguan and the Sixth District, he believed that the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army worked for the poor, and he united workers to make revolution, calling on everyone to say, "We poor people have nothing to fear except poverty." Hearing his words, everyone joined the struggle. He led the poor people in his village and also helped the poor people in other villages to turn over, leading more than 20 struggles in total, working day and night without ever saying he was tired. He led the masses to distribute land and establish peasant associations. When distributing the fruits of the struggle, he always let the masses discuss the methods of distribution first, and never made decisions on his own. When it came to his turn, he always took whatever the masses gave him. He often said, "I am the errand runner for the masses. Whatever the poor want me to do, I will do. The middle peasants are our own people and should never be struggled against." He is loved by all the workers and peasants in this area. At the model congress for liberation jointly opened by the Fourth and Sixth Districts, the masses presented him with a model flag. (Yongnian Liberation News)

    肃清敌伪残余武装
    高唐开展反奸清算
    永年六区涌现翻身领袖
    【本报威县十四日电】高唐新收复区正猛烈开展反奸清算运动。运动以城区南关为重点，经半月的大力发动，改造了奸霸地主的假农会，斗倒了掌握村政、压制群众的杜芳洲。农会由四十人发展到六十五人，雇工会亦发展到十一人。接着又清算了白少言的汉奸资财。群众力量愈来愈大。现东、西、南关都成立了农会，全城关农会员已达三百五十人。各街共斗争十一次，得到赔款三十二万元，棉花一万七千斤，土地一百四十亩，大部贫苦农民都分到百余斤棉花。特别四十家军属，在群众照顾下，得到更多的果实。运动中锻炼与提高了群众觉悟，涌现出二十余名积极分子和群众领袖。为了统一城关区群众运动的领导，已组织起城关委员会。领导全城群众继续展开更深入的反奸诉苦斗争。最近在三千五百多人的斗争大会上，斗倒了依仗敌伪杀害人民的伪街长马清韩，几十个苦主倒出了八年的苦水，三千多人高吭的呼着“有冤的诉冤，有仇的报仇”，杀人马逆在广大群众压力下已经低头。斗争会结束后，群众异常兴奋、愉快。现各组正讨论对马逆的处理，并热烈讨论扩大民兵、保卫自己斗争果实、保卫家乡、打击伪匪郑协忱杂团的进攻。
    【本报讯】李海林是永年六区娄里村人，从小当工人，家里没有一亩地，生活非常艰难。八路军解放洛关及六区后，他相信共产党八路军为穷人办事，串连工人闹翻身，号召大家说：“咱们穷人除了怕穷，就没有可怕的。”大家听了他的话，便纷纷参加了斗争。他领导本村外又帮助外村穷人翻身，共领导了二十多次斗争，黑夜白天打熬，从没说过劳累。领导群众分土地，建立农会。在分斗争果实时，总是先让群众讨论办法来分，从不自己先作主张。轮到自己，总是群众给啥算啥。他常说：“我是群众的跑腿人，穷人叫干啥我干啥，中农是自己人，绝不可斗争。”他受到这一带全体工人农民的爱戴，四、六区合开的翻身大会上群众送了他一面模范旗。（永年翻身报）
