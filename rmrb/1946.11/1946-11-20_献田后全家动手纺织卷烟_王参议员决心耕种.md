    After Donating Land, Entire Family Starts Spinning and Weaving, Rolling Cigarettes
    Senator Wang Resolves to Farm
    [Our Newspaper, Weixian, 16th Dispatch] Wang Zongzhou, a senator from Gucheng and a resident of Zhongzhen in the town center, has a family of forty with 104 mu of land. In previous years, all of it was rented out, and his family members had never participated in labor, nor did they have any farming tools. During the land reform movement, Senator Wang voluntarily donated 30 mu of land. He plans to farm the remaining 74 mu himself next year and intends to sell 14 mu to purchase farm tools such as carts, oxen, leather harnesses, plows, and hoes. In addition to resolving to learn farming, Senator Wang also bought a cigarette rolling machine, two piglets, and several spinning wheels to engage in winter household sideline production. The entire family has now begun a new life of labor.

    献田后全家动手纺织卷烟
    王参议员决心耕种
    【本报威县十六日电】故城王参议员宗州，城关中镇人。全家四十口，有地一顷零四亩，历年全数出租，家人未参加过劳动，亦无农具。在土地改革运动中，王参议员自动献田卅亩。所余七十四亩，预备明年自己耕种，并计划出卖十四亩置买大车、耕牛、皮套、犁、锄等农具。王参议员除决心学习耕种外，并买卷烟机一架，小猪两口，纺花车数辆，以进行冬季家庭副业生产。全家现已开始了劳动的新生活。
