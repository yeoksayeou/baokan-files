    [From our Guantao correspondent] On October 12th, a county-wide cadre conference was held, with the teacher training class also participating. At the meeting, Political Commissar Zhang described the current domestic self-defense war situation, pointing out that cadres in the rear should intensify their work and practice frugality to donate funds to support the front lines. Teacher Ren Jingtang immediately stood up and responded, willing to donate his entire month's salary of 140 catties of rice. Subsequently, Section Chief Dong of the Education Section stood up and donated his entire year's savings of 5,000 yuan, and all his monthly 20 catties of millet subsidy to support the front lines until victory in the war. Then Zhao Shusen, Liu Zijun, Wang Rumin, Wang Qingxin, and Wang Jinchi successively donated their entire month's rice. Deputy Section Chief Guo of the school department has a difficult family situation; his family was originally supported by government relief, receiving 40 catties of relief rice each month. Now, hearing of the tension on the front lines, he declared that if the civil war does not stop, he will not accept relief grain, but will support the front lines entirely, and the family will be self-reliant. The entire class donated a total of 10,530 catties of rice and 147,000 yuan.
