Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 23rd—More than ten million farmers in the Shandong Liberated Area have achieved the goal of "land to the tiller." In the Binhai District, land reform in eight counties has been largely completed. In Zhuting County (Ganyu), farmers received an average of more than two mu of land per person. During the movement, most small and medium landlords were reasonably settled through government arbitration, with their remaining land generally one-third or one time more than that of middle peasants, allowing them to live prosperous lives. After the settlement of accounts for the landlord Ma Bosheng in Tai'an, he was supposed to owe the masses 10 million North Sea currency, but the farmers voluntarily conceded and only calculated his debt based on a hundred mu of land. The commercial part of his business was not touched at all. After implementing "land to the tiller," the appearance of the village was completely renewed. In Weijia Village, Luji District, Zhuting, 23 of the 82 households of middle peasants were upgraded to rich peasants, and 59 households of the utterly poor were upgraded to middle peasants. In Zhu Shen Village, Nanhe District, Jiaoxian County, over a hundred head of draught cattle were added. Farmers in counties such as Feixian, Qingshui, and Junan (newly established county, south of Juxian) have independently established more than 400 primary schools, beating gongs and drums, buying oil and slaughtering pigs, and vying to hire teachers. In Huangzhuang District, Yiyuan (new county, north of Yishui), the area of wheat cultivation has doubled compared to previous years, and five dyeing workshops and four textile factories have been opened, with the general standard of living rising.

　　山东省千万农民获得土地
    【新华社山东二十三日电】山东解放区已有一千余万农民达到耕者有其田。滨海区八县土地改革大部完成，竹庭县（赣榆）农民平均每人得二亩多地，运动中一般中小地主多经政府仲裁合理解决，留田均比中农多三分之一或一倍，过着富裕生活。泰安地主马伯声清算后，应欠群众北海币一千万元，但农民自动让步，仅算他百余亩地。他所经营的商业部分，则丝毫未动，实行耕者有其田后，该村面貌焕然一新。竹庭芦集区韦家村八十二户中二十三户中农升为富农，五十九户赤贫升为中农。胶县南河区朱葚村增加耕牛百余头，费县、沁水、莒南（新设县，莒县南）等县农民自办四百余处小学，打锣击鼓，买油杀猪，争聘教员。沂源（新县，沂水北）黄庄区扩种麦地较往年多一倍，并开设染坊五处，纺织厂四所，生活水准普遍上升。
