Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th: New York dispatch: After a week of meetings by the committees of the United Nations General Assembly, the General Assembly reopened yesterday morning (New York time). The General Assembly unanimously approved the resolutions for Afghanistan, Iceland, and Sweden to join the United Nations. During the discussion, the Danish representative proposed that the suggestion to allow the above three countries to join the United Nations should include the phrase "in accordance with Article 4 of the Charter and Rule 103 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Assembly." The Danish amendment was also unanimously adopted. Representatives from Norway, Iran, Czechoslovakia, Argentina, India, Poland, Ecuador, the Soviet Union, and Uruguay all issued statements in favor of the three countries joining the United Nations. In a brief statement, Molotov supported the Danish amendment and welcomed the three countries to the United Nations. The General Assembly then discussed the second item on the agenda, namely the Secretary-General's report on the removal of the Spanish issue from the Security Council's agenda. The General Assembly did not raise any questions and proceeded to discuss other issues on the agenda. The first was the final selection of the site for the United Nations headquarters. The US representative, Bloom, requested that the headquarters be located in the United States. The Ukrainian representative, Manuilsky, raised the inconvenience of locating the headquarters in New York or San Francisco and expressed the hope that the next General Assembly should be held in Europe. The Brazilian representative supported Bloom's opinion, while Molotov supported the Ukrainian proposal, arguing that after holding the General Assembly in London and New York, it would be fair for the next General Assembly to be held in Europe. The British representative proposed an amendment stating that, on the condition that the headquarters remained in the United States, the committee tasked with selecting the site could choose cities other than New York and San Francisco. The British proposal ultimately passed with 22 votes in favor, 12 votes against, and one abstention. The meeting then adjourned and reconvened at 4:00 PM (New York time) on the 9th.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 11th: According to a report in the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao on the 3rd: The newspaper's New York correspondent telegraphed on the 1st: The situation of the Chinese Chiang government delegation in the United Nations General Assembly is extremely embarrassing. "First, China is in a civil war, so it is difficult for the Chinese delegation to deal with discussions on issues such as disarmament (Chiang Kai-shek is carrying out a nationwide conscription). Second, the Chinese government's unenlightened measures at home make it difficult for the Chinese delegation to speak grandly about respecting human rights. Third, the nature of the delegation is also a problem. All the representatives are government diplomats, and they cannot represent the political opinions of all parties in the country."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th: New York dispatch: At the request of the Soviet representative, the Four Foreign Ministers Conference adjourned for a day on the 7th (Soviet National Day) and reconvened on the evening of the 8th. The meeting lasted for five hours and discussed issues such as banning Italian fascist organizations, Albania's right to participate in signing the peace treaty with Italy, navigation on the Danube River, and foreign property in Romania. When discussing the first issue, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov pointed out that fascism has been revived in Italy. After four days of meetings, the Foreign Ministers Conference has completed the preliminary review of the entire Italian peace treaty and the Romanian peace treaty, but no agreement has been reached on the thorny issue of the Italian-Yugoslav border and Trieste. According to the latest report from the United Press, the four foreign ministers made a decision last night to postpone the discussion of this issue indefinitely. It is also learned that prior to this, the British and American foreign ministers had met with Yugoslav Foreign Minister Simic on the 7th and 8th to discuss this issue.

    联合国大会一致通过
    瑞典阿富汗等国参加
    蒋政府代表在联大会上狼狈不堪
    外长会议完成对意和约审查
    【新华社延安十日电】纽约讯：联合国大会各委员会集会一周之后，昨日上午（纽约时间）重开大会，大会一致通过了阿富汗、冰岛及瑞典三国参加联合国之决议。在讨论时，丹麦代表主张允许上述三国参加联合国之建议案，应包括“与宪章第四条及大会规则第一百零三条相吻合”之字句，丹麦之修正案亦为全体一致通过。挪威、伊朗、捷克、阿根廷、印度、波兰、厄瓜多尔、苏联及乌拉圭等国代表，皆发表声明，赞成该三国加入联合国。莫洛托夫于简短之声明中，支持丹麦之修正案，并欢迎该三国加入联合国。大会随即讨论会议议事日程上之第二点，即由秘书长报告自安理会日程上撤消西班牙问题之事项大会并未提出任何问题，于是乃进行讨论议事日程上之其他问题。首先是联合国会址最终选择问题，美代表白鲁姆要求会址应设于美国。乌克兰代表曼努意斯基提出会址设于纽约或旧金山之不便，并表示希望下届大会应于欧洲大陆召开。巴西代表支持白鲁姆意见，莫洛托夫则支持乌克兰之建议，他认为在伦敦与纽约召开大会以后，下次大会应在欧陆召开才算公道。英代表提出修正案，主张在会址仍设于美国之条件下，受命选择会址之委员会，得选择纽约及旧金山以外之其他城市。英方建议最终以廿二票对十二票通过，一票弃权。会议旋告休会。至九日下午四时（纽约时间）再行召开。
    【新华社延安十一日电】据三日沪大公报载：该报纽约特派员一日专电称：在联合国大会中中国蒋政府代表团之处境极为难堪，“第一、中国正在打内战，以此中国代表团对于裁军一类问题的讨论，就很难应付（按蒋介石正进行全国性的征兵）。第二、中国政府在国内不开明的措置，使中国代表团对于尊重人权事就很难开口说大话。第三、代表团的性质也成问题，所有的代表是政府的外交官，他们不能代表国内各方的政治意见。
    【新华社延安十日电】纽约讯：四强外长会议应苏联代表之请，于七日（苏联国庆纪念日）休会一天，于八日晚复会。会议达五小时之久，讨论取缔意大利法西斯组织，阿尔巴尼亚参加签订对意和约之权利，多瑙河通航及罗马尼亚之外国财产等问题。在讨论第一个问题时，苏外长莫洛托夫指出法西斯主义已在意大利复活。外长会议集会四天以后，已完成了对整个意大利和约及对罗和约的初步审查，但对于棘手的意南边界与的里雅斯特问题仍未取得协议。据合众社最后消息报导：四外长已于昨晚作出决定，无限期的延缓这一问题的讨论。另悉在此之前，英美外长曾于七八两日分别与南斯拉夫外长西米区会谈此一问题。笙?⒈ǖ迹核耐獬ひ延谧蛲碜鞒鼍龆ǎ?尴奁诘难踊赫庖晃侍獾奶?论。另悉在此之前，英美外长曾于七八两日分别与南斯拉夫外长西米区会谈此一问题。
