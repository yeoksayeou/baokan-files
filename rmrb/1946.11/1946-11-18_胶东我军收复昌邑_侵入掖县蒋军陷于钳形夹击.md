    Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 15th. The Jiaodong Eighth Route Army recovered Changyi City on the 10th. The Chiang army's 8th Army, Independent 2nd Regiment, and other units entrenched in the city and Xinke, more than 40 kilometers northeast of the city, fled in disarray eastward towards the Hei Yang Mountains south of Shahe on the Yantai road, where they joined up with the army invading Yexian. The Chiang army, entrenched in Hanting and Zhuli Street, 20 kilometers southwest of the city, also fled westward in panic. By this point, the Chiang army that had ventured to invade Yexian was caught in a pincer attack from Changyi and Pingdu.
    Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 15th. More than 300 soldiers and officers of the Chiang army's Independent 10th Division, who were liberated in the Zouping Campaign, have voluntarily joined the Eighth Route Army. The military and civilians in the Bohai Liberated Area held a grand welcoming meeting in a certain place on the 4th. The masses from nearby villages came to congratulate them with gongs and drums. After representatives of various groups presented flowers, more than 300 new comrades-in-arms涌各兵团 [Translator's note: I am uncertain about the exact meaning of 涌各兵团. It could mean "flooded into various military corps" or "rushed towards various military corps". I'm choosing the former].进
