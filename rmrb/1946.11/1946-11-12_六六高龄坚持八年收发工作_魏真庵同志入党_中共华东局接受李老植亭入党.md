    Sixty-Six-Year-Old Insists on Eight Years of Mailroom Work
    Comrade Wei Zhen'an Joins the Party
    East China Bureau of the CPC Accepts Li Laozhiting into the Party
    [This newspaper] On the seventh of this month, Xinhua Bookstore held a meeting for two reasons: first, to commemorate the 29th anniversary of the October Revolution; and second, to celebrate Comrade Wei Zhen'an joining the Party. Comrade Wei Zhen'an is sixty-six years old this year and is from Yushe, Shanxi. He has been doing mailroom work for the North China Xinhua Daily since the beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japan, and continued in the mailroom after coming to the bookstore. He has consistently been active and responsible in his work for the past eight years, and was selected as a model worker in the North China Xinhua Daily. His four sons have also joined the workforce under his influence. Although Comrade Wei is an elderly man in his sixties, he is passionate about pursuing truth and progress. He said, "I have lived for more than sixty years and have experienced three eras: the first is the Manchu era; the second is the era of warlord infighting after the founding of the Republic of China; and the third is the new society in the liberated areas today. In the old society, I worked as a shop assistant for more than ten years. When I got old, they didn't want me anymore. It wasn't until the Communist Party came along that I found a way out. Today, I can still work for the revolution and be respected everywhere. The public is educating and nurturing all four of my children. Take my eldest child, for example. He started working as a worker, and then he was transferred to the Party School in Yan'an. Now I hear he has gone to work in the Northeast. In the old society, if you were a poor worker, no one would care about you, let alone go to school."
    He said, "The revolutionary ranks are my home. As long as I have a breath left in me, I will do something for the revolution." When the bookstore branch officially accepted his application to join the Party, he happily said, "I am so old, and the public is also educating and nurturing my children. As long as I join the Party, my life will be complete." Seeing that Chiang Kai-shek has been fighting a civil war, he said indignantly, "Chiang Kai-shek is still fighting a long-term civil war, and I, an old man, am determined to fight him for a long time."

    Xinhua News Agency, Shandong Telegram: Li Zhiting, speaker of the Bohai Liberated Area, who is 75 years old, recently applied to the Bohai District Committee of the CPC to transfer to the East China Central Bureau of the CPC, requesting approval to join the Communist Party of China. It is reported that the East China Bureau of the CPC has replied by telegram approving it on the 10th, and sent a telegram of encouragement. In his application to join the Party, Elder Li stated: "I was born in the tenth year of Tongzhi in the Qing Dynasty and am now 75 years old. Looking back over the past few decades, those who have governed with love and benevolence, except for the Communist Party, are few and far between." After recounting the昏暗君臣of the Qing Dynasty, the loss of power and national humiliation, the daily decline of the people's livelihood, and the increasing deterioration of social customs, as well as the facts of Yuan Shikai's usurpation of the country and harming the people in the early Republic of China, he wrote: "After the Chinese people defeated the Japanese invaders, they eagerly hoped to see the emergence of a peaceful, democratic, prosperous, and strong New Democratic China. Who knew that the reactionary lackeys within the Kuomintang would collude with their American 'father emperor' and launch an all-out civil war in an attempt to suppress the people's forces. Therefore, with firm determination, I request to join the great Communist Party of China, and under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, I am willing to donate this old body for the comprehensive and thorough victory of the anti-civil war and anti-aggression struggle."

    六六高龄坚持八年收发工作
    魏真庵同志入党
    中共华东局接受李老植亭入党
    【本报讯】本月七号，新华书店开会，一、为纪念十月革命二十九周年；二、为庆祝本店魏老真庵同志入党。按魏真庵同志今年六十六岁，山西榆社人，自抗战开始即参加华北新华日报做收发工作，后到书店仍任收发。八年来工作一贯积极负责，曾在华北新华日报馆被选为模范工作者。他的四个儿子也在他影响下参加了工作。魏同志虽是一个六十多岁的老人，但却酷爱追求真理、追求进步。他说：“我活了六十多年，也算经过了三个时代：第一个是满清时代；第二个是民国成立后军阀混战的时代；第三个便是今天解放区的新社会。在旧社会里给人家当了十几年店员，等咱岁数大啦，人家也不要了。直到有了共产党我才找着了出路。我今天还能为革命工作，而且到处受人尊敬。四个孩子都是公家给培养着。就说我大孩子吧，一参加工作当工人，后来就调到延安住党校，现在听说又到了东北工作。要是在旧社会，当个穷工人，理就没人理，更不用说住学校了。”
    他说：“革命队伍就是我的家，我只要有一口气，就要替革命做一天事。”当书店支部正式接收他的入党要求时，他愉快的说：“我这么大岁数啦，孩子们也有公家给教育培养，只要我加入了党，这一辈子就算啥事也没啦。”他看到蒋介石一直打内战，曾愤慨的说：“蒋介石还是长期内战，我这个老人就有决心和他长期奋斗。”          （叶子）
    【新华社山东电】渤海解放区七五高龄之李植亭议长，近曾申请中共渤海区党委转中共华东中央局，请求批准其加入中国共产党。顷悉中共华东局已于十日复电批准，并致电慰勉。李老于其入党申请书中称：“我生于前清同治十年现已七十五岁，纵观几十年来，施政爱仁者，除共产党外，则颇人乏人。”他历数清朝之君昏臣暗，丧权辱国，人民生计日蹙，社会习尚益败之情形及民国初期之袁世凯窃国害民等事实后，写道：“在中国人民战败日寇后，热望能看到和平民主富强的新民主主义中国的出现，谁知道国民党内反动奴才，又与其美国‘父皇’勾结，发动全面内战，企图镇压人民力量。故我以坚毅之决心，要求加入伟大的中国共产党，愿在中国共产党与毛主席之领导下，为反内战反侵略的全面彻底胜利而捐此老躯。”
