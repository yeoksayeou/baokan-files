　　Give us back our flour!
    The Bohai Relief Committee protests the Chiang army's robbery
    [Xinhua News Agency] About 30,000 jin of relief flour transported by UNRRA to Changshan, Gaoyuan and Qingcheng counties in the Bohai Liberated Area was delivered to Gaoyuan county town in mid-month, ready to be distributed to refugees. At that time, the 73rd Army's 193rd Division and the 15th Division of the Chiang army, entrenched in Huantai, Zouping and other places, fled to the north and south banks of the Xiaoqing River along the borders of the three counties, and all the flour was looted. The Bohai Relief Committee has sent a telegram to UNRRA to lodge a serious protest to the Kuomintang authorities, and demanded that the Chiang army be pursued to recover and compensate for the robbed relief supplies.
