　　[Our Newspaper, Weixian, 20th dispatch] The counterattacks of illegal landlords in various parts of southern Hebei have been smashed. As the land leveling and replenishment movement in southern Hebei entered its climax, illegal landlords in various places organized secret societies and plotted riots, using beautiful women to seduce village cadres, or using petty favors to win over activists, attempting to restore their power. In Yuwang Village, ×× County, Yu Fengyi, a landlord who had been overthrown, organized reactionary landlords to form the Red Spear Society, which attacked our militia. After a heroic counterattack by the militia, they were all captured. The village militia joint defense is strengthening sentry duty and suppressing armed agents and reactionaries. Zhang Yushan, a local tyrant landlord in Nantunzi, bought off Zhang Zhonglu, the militia captain, with 21 mu of good land, causing disunity within the militia. After a major inspection, Zhang Yushan's counter-offensive conspiracy was exposed, the degenerated militia captain was purged, and the unity of the masses was consolidated. In Maodian Village, Wucheng, landlord Lü Hanjun, in order to sabotage the workers' organization and achieve the purpose of not increasing wages, had his eighteen-year-old daughter eat and laugh with the hired workers. When the masses wanted to struggle against him, he bought many things and gave them to activists. These conspiracies have all been exposed by the masses. When the masses in Wangqizhuang, En County, discussed the struggle against the local tyrant landlord Kong Qingwen, his wife prepared a banquet and invited several young village cadres to their home, with his daughter-in-law accompanying them, attempting to lure the village cadres and avoid the struggle. But the village cadres did not waver. Seeing that this trick did not work, he falsely accused the militia captain of raping his daughter-in-law. After an investigation by the district, his daughter-in-law told the truth. She said: "This was not the case, my mother-in-law forced me to say it. If I didn't say it, I would be beaten!" After confessing, she also joined the women's association. When struggling against her parents-in-law, she also participated in complaining and accusing her parents-in-law of crimes. In Fancun, Jize, the special agent landlord Liu Yulu was arrested during this inspection movement. According to his confession, he joined the Kuomintang in 1938 and was ordered to secretly carry out sabotage activities. He had spread rumors to threaten the masses, saying: "Whoever participates in the struggle, those from the south will come and cut off their heads!" Zhang Yinji, a special agent who had sabotaged the conscription work, confessed that they had an armed unit internally, specializing in assassination activities, which has now been uncovered by the masses. In the four villages of Dongliufang, Niuzhuang, Dongbeizhuang, and Dongtunzhuang in the Second District, several armed agents, including Wang Zhigeng, were captured. Based on the above facts, the leadership has called on the masses in both new and old areas and border areas to be educated, raise their vigilance, strengthen the militia work, and suppress the counter-offensive and sabotage activities of illegal landlords and special agents.

　　冀南填补进入高潮地主反攻均遭粉碎
    【本报威县二十日电】冀南各地不法地主反攻已被粉碎。当冀南填平补齐运动进入高潮时，各地不法地主组织会门阴谋暴动，利用美女勾引村干部，或小恩小惠拉拢积极分子，企图复辟。××县于王庄被斗倒的于凤义组织反动地主成立红枪会，曾向我民兵武装进攻；经民兵英勇反击，将其全部捕获。该村民兵联防正加强站岗放哨，镇压武装特务及反动分子。南屯子恶霸地主张玉山以好地二十一亩收买了民兵队长张仲禄，引起民兵内部不团结。经过大检查，揭破了张玉山的反攻阴谋，清洗了蜕化了的民兵队长，巩固了群众团结。武城毛店村地主吕憾俊为了破坏工人组织，达到不增资目的，让他十八岁的闺女陪着雇工吃饭、说笑；群众要斗争他时，又买了好些东西送给积极分子。这些阴谋，已全被群众揭破。恩县王其庄当群众讨论斗争恶霸地主孔庆温时，他老婆准备酒席，把几个青年村干请到家里，让他媳妇陪着，企图引诱村干，避免斗争。但村干都不动摇。他见此计不成，便诬告民兵队长强奸她儿媳妇。经区里调查，她儿媳妇说了实话。她说：“本来没这事，俺婆婆强迫俺说。不说就得挨打！”坦白以后，她也参加了妇女会。在斗争她公婆时，她也参加诉苦，控告其公婆罪恶。鸡泽范村在此次检查运动中，拘捕了特务地主刘玉禄。据供称他于民国二十七年参加国民党，受命秘密进行破坏活动，曾造谣威胁群众说：“谁参加斗争，南边过来杀谁的头！”曾破坏参军工作的特务张印基供称：他们内部设有武装股，专作暗杀活动，现已为群众破获。二区东六房、牛庄、东北庄、东屯庄四村，捕获了武装特务王志更等数名。根据以上事实，领导上已号召无论在新老地区及边沿地区，均应教育群众，提高警惕，加强民兵工作，镇压不法地主特务分子的反攻破坏活动。
