　　[Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 21st] The Xuwan District Transportation Team in Sheyang (formerly southeast of Funing in the new county) was selected as a model transportation team in the Fifth Sub-district of Jiangsu and Anhui. Each of the 120 civilian laborers in the team received a bonus of 500 yuan (Central China currency). Four civilian laborers, Wang Zhaocai, Zhou Bingxue, Li Shuzhang, and Xu Dewen, and two cadres, Li Buren and Xu Mingteng, were selected as individual models, each receiving a bonus of 1,000 yuan (Central China currency). Ruzhen Village in Xuwan District was also awarded as a model village. At the award ceremony, Section Chief Yu of the Logistics Headquarters praised their spirit of persistence for 38 days and awarded them a banner that read "Transportation Model." Wang Zhaocai is a model transportation team member who serves in the medical section of the Ministry of Health. For a month, he has been carrying loads of over 50 kilograms every day and never asks anyone to take over. Zhu Buhong, the captain of Zhou Bin Township, often helps wounded soldiers wash gauze and feed them during marches. When he was hired as the transportation captain of the operating room at the hospital, he had a very good relationship with the civilian laborers. The civilian laborers even said, "If Captain Zhu doesn't go back, we won't go back either." Township Chief Xu Mingteng often took a load from the transportation team and carried it himself. Once, when a civilian laborer fell ill, he personally pushed the patient on a cart.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 21st] Medical personnel in various parts of Shandong have put forward the slogan "Everything for the wounded," working day and night, actively donating blood, and rescuing the wounded. He Yongfu, a Shandong model nurse and current branch director of a certain hospital, was once responsible for transferring the wounded. In the middle of the night, he personally waded through the muddy water to mobilize civilian laborers. After the departure, he did not sleep for two days and nights, taking care of the wounded with all his heart and strength. After the Jiaoxian-Gaomi campaign, a certain field hospital in Jiaodong worked continuously for four days and nights to provide emergency treatment to the wounded. All 80-plus employees of the hospital gave their bedding to the wounded to lie on. A field hospital in southern Shandong launched a blood donation campaign, with more than 90 percent of the hospital staff signing up to donate blood. Zhang Hongsan, a nurse in Xiaotun, was found to have a universal blood type and immediately signed up to donate 200 CC of blood. Zhu Yi and Chen Wen, medical staff members who had just arrived from Shanghai, not only signed up to donate blood but also requested that their first-class technical allowance be cancelled.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 20th] During the battle to liberate Anqiu, more than 40,000 militiamen from Binhai and Luzhong actively participated in the war and undertook wartime service. A certain militia squad in Yidong (a new county, east of Yishui) cooperated with the main force to attack the city, capturing nine Chiang soldiers and their weapons. More than 4,000 militiamen transported more than 3,000 rifles and other guns, 150,000 jin of grain, and a large number of military supplies to the rear in one day. Another unit of 2,000 militiamen completely destroyed the city wall fortifications built by the Chiang and puppet troops. When the stretcher teams were carrying the wounded, they did not rest except for brief stops to drink water during the dozens of miles of travel. They constantly encouraged each other with the saying, "Arriving at the hospital one minute earlier reduces the wounded's suffering by one minute." In the evening, they took off their cotton-padded clothes and sheepskin jackets to cover the wounded to prevent them from catching cold.
