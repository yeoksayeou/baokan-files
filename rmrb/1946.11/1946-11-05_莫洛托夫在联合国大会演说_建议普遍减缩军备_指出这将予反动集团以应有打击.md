Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st -- Reports from various sources: In his speech at the United Nations General Assembly on the 29th, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov made a suggestion regarding the issue of universal arms reduction. Molotov pointed out: Reducing armaments will give due blows to those groups who have not learned a sufficient lesson from the shameful collapse of the aggressors in this war. On the other hand, it should not be forgotten that if certain countries, on the one hand, declare a policy of peace, but on the other hand, not only do not reduce their armaments, but expand them in quantity and quality, then other countries have the right to doubt the sincerity of their declarations of peace. Based on Article 11 of the United Nations Charter (note: the main content of Article 11 of the United Nations Charter is: the General Assembly may consider the general principles of cooperation in maintaining international peace and security, including the principles of disarmament and arms control, and may make recommendations to member states or the Security Council or to both regarding such principles), the Soviet delegation proposed that the General Assembly consider the following recommendations: (1) In order to consolidate peace and security and in order to conform to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Organization, the General Assembly deems it necessary to universally reduce armaments. (2) The decision regarding the reduction of armaments should include the primary task of prohibiting the production and use of atomic energy for military purposes. (3) The General Assembly recommends that the Security Council ensure the effective implementation of the tasks stipulated in the above two (1) and (2). (4) The General Assembly calls on all countries to give all assistance to the Security Council in this responsible work. This task conforms to the interests of establishing lasting peace and international security, and also conforms to the interests of countries in reducing the economic burden caused by excessive military expenditures. Such armaments are disproportionate to the conditions of post-war peace. Molotov concluded: The passage of the decision on universal arms reduction and the prohibition of the military use of atomic energy will truly conform to the peaceful aspirations of our people and will help the development of international cooperation. Finally, let us express the confidence that this proposal of the Soviet delegation will receive the support of all United Nations.

　　莫洛托夫在联合国大会演说
    建议普遍减缩军备
    指出这将予反动集团以应有打击
    【新华社延安一日电】各方报导：苏外长莫洛托夫二十九日在联合国大会的演说中，曾就普遍减缩军备问题，提出建议。莫洛托夫指出：缩减军备，将予那些未从这次战争侵略者可耻崩溃中得到充分教训的集团以应有的打击。另一方面，不应忘记，如果某些国家一方面宣言和平政策，另一方面不但不缩减其军备，反而在数量上与质量上扩大它，那末其它国家就有权利来怀疑其和平宣言的诚意了。苏代表团根据联合国宪章第十一条（按：联合国宪章第十一条的主要内容是：联合国大会得考虑关于维持国际和平及安全之合作之普遍原则，包括军缩及军备管制之原则。并得向会员国或安理会或兼向两者提出对于该项原则之建议）提议大会考虑下列建议：（一）为了巩固和平及安全，为了符合于联合国组织之目的与原则，大会认为需要普遍缩减军备。（二）关于缩减军备的决定，应包括禁止为军事目的生产，与使用原子能的首要任务。（三）由大会建议要安理会保证切实执行上述（一）（二）两项中所规定之任务。（四）大会号召一切国家对安理会这一负责工作，予以一切帮助，这一任务符合于建立持久和平，及国际安全的利益，也符合于各国减轻由于过分军备支出、而引起的经济重负之利益。这种军备是与战后和平的条件不相称的。莫洛托夫末谓：普遍缩减军备，及在军事上禁止使用原子能的决定之通过，将真正符合于我们人民的和平愿望，并将有助于国际合作之发展。最后让我们表示此种信心，即苏联代表团这一建议将获得一切联合国之支持。
