　　Villagers of Fantian Village Recall Awakening and Increased Awareness:
    Vigorously Fight Against Little Chiang Kai-shek Li Yuanxiang
    [Report from Wen County by our newspaper] After the peasants of Fantian Village in this county underwent a liquidation movement, they launched a struggle against special agents. Before the liquidation movement was carried out in the village, the leadership had already discovered that the landlord Li Yuanxiang was a Chiang Kai-shek's secret agent (he had copied the list of the farmers' association and sent it to the Chiang army, plotting a "change of regime") and had called on the masses to struggle against him. However, because the masses' political consciousness was not high enough, they could not understand or accept it. After reviewing the situation, the leadership first organized the masses to carry out a liquidation struggle against the local tyrant landlord. Through the struggle, the peasants recognized the root of their poverty and recovered the land, grain, and other things that had been taken away, thus guaranteeing their livelihood. Recently, when recalling their past sufferings, the peasants recalled the glorious history of the cadres leading the masses in heroically resisting Japan and defending the village. They recalled how Li Yuanxiang maintained the enemy, helped the enemy do evil, and squeezed the marrow out of the entire village. Afterwards, they talked about his various crimes in a chaotic manner, and the masses gnashed their teeth with hatred, saying, "They impoverished the entire village before, and now that we have just found a way to survive, they want to plot against us again! We must fight him to the end!" A sixty-year-old peasant who had been emancipated raised his arms and shouted, and the masses roared and went to find Li's brother to demand guns and Li's family letters, and to question him about the various rumors he had spread in the past about changing the regime. Faced with the enraged masses, Li's brother dared not resist and had to hand over a pistol and a Mauser pistol with more than sixty rounds of ammunition, as well as family letters, and guaranteed that he would never spread rumors to scare the masses again. The victorious masses said: "When the gun of the little Chiang Kai-shek in the village is handed over, the big Chiang Kai-shek will be easier to deal with!" (Zhang Junshan)

　　番田村群众回忆翻身觉悟提高
    忿斗小蒋介石李元祥
    【本报温县讯】本县番田村农民经过清算运动，掀起反特务斗争。该村在未进行清算运动前，领导上即发现地主李元祥为蒋记特务（曾将农会名单抄送蒋军，阴谋“变天”）并曾号召群众对他斗争；但因群众政治觉悟不够，不能了解与接受。领导上经过检讨，乃首先组织群众对恶霸地主进行清算斗争。经过斗争，农民认识了自己的穷根，并清算回来被夺去的土地粮食等，生活获得保障。最近进行翻身回忆，农民从过去干部领导群众英勇抗日守寨的光荣历史，回忆到以后李元祥维持敌人，帮敌作恶，把全村群众压榨得骨髓都干了。以后就乱纷纷谈起他各种罪行，群众都咬牙切齿的恨起来说：“他们以前害穷了全村，今天咱刚刚有了活路，又想来谋算咱啦！非跟他干到底不行！”一个六十多岁的翻身老农民振臂一喊，群众即呼啸而起，相率去找李逆之弟要枪、要李逆家信，并追问他过去所造各种变天谣言。李逆之弟在暴怒的群众面前，不敢抗拒，只得将一枝二把手枪与六十多发子弹及家信等交出，并保证以后再不敢造谣言吓唬群众。获得胜利的群众说：“把村里小蒋介石的枪交了，大蒋介石就好对付啦！”（张俊山）
