    "Du Ba Lian" Militia Cleverly Win Victory
    Stuffed Straw Figures Repel Stubborn Troops

    [Our Newspaper, Jiyuan News] On September 23rd, a platoon of stubborn troops stationed in Potou disturbed our Xizhuang Village and were immediately surrounded by our "Du Ba Lian" militia. Seeing the situation was unfavorable, the enemy moved into the stockaded village the next day and dared not stay in the village. The "Du Ba Lian" militia planned to eliminate this part of the stubborn troops and came up with a clever plan: On the 25th, they made a straw figure, dressed it in a military uniform, put on a military hat, and gave it a command flag. A militiaman raised the straw figure in a trench very close to the enemy, waving it back and forth, as if a commander was directing the team to walk back and forth, with people in the trench shouting, suddenly exposing themselves, then suddenly hiding. At this time, the enemy opened fire on the straw figure, firing a burst from two machine guns and all their firepower. Several militiamen took the opportunity to run to the west side of the enemy's firepower and launched a flanking attack. After only firing two shots, the enemy thought they were surrounded, panicked, and turned tail to run. The stockaded village was immediately occupied by our militia, and they continued to pursue. Comrade Jiang Zhuan of the militia shot and killed the stubborn troops' squad leader with one shot. (Cheng Cheng)

    “杜八联”民兵巧计取胜
    扎草人打退顽军
    【本报济源讯】住坡头顽军一个排于九月二十三日出扰我膝庄村，当即被我“杜八联”民兵围困。敌人看势不好，第二天就住到寨子上，不敢在村里停。“杜八联”民兵计划消灭这部分顽军，就想出了个巧计：他们在二十五号的那天，做了个草人，穿上军衣，戴上军帽，手里拿着一个指挥旗，用一个民兵在离敌人很近的战壕内举起草人，来回摇晃，好像指挥员在指挥队伍似的来回走着，壕下的人口里喊着，忽然暴露，忽然隐蔽。这时，敌人就向草人开了枪，两挺机枪和全部火力一阵射击。几个民兵趁机跑到敌火力西边绕道侧击，只打了两枪，敌人以为受了包围，惊惶失措的扭转屁股就跑了。寨子当即被我民兵占领，并继续追击，民兵姜转同志一枪打死顽班长。          （成诚）
