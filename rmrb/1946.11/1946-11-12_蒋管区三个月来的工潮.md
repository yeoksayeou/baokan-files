    Labor unrest in the Jiang-controlled areas over the past three months
    Xinhua News Agency
    In the past three months, especially since late August, labor unrest in various Jiang-controlled areas has surged again, involving more than 500,000 workers.
    In Shanghai, the national industrial center, a total of 561 labor disputes occurred in July, August, and September, averaging 187 cases per month, an increase of more than 74% compared to the first half of the year (a total of 642 cases with over 310,000 participants, averaging 107 cases per month). Especially after late August, large-scale strikes and slowdowns occurred continuously, involving industries such as rice, cement, shoe manufacturing, dyeing and weaving, sewing, tobacco, canning, dried goods, watch repair, bookstore binding, shipyards, ship loading and unloading, buses, and rickshaws. Among these, the largest in scale were the strike of over 30,000 workers in over 1,000 dried goods businesses throughout the city on August 30th, which lasted for twelve days, and the strike of over 3,000 ship loading and unloading workers, which froze twenty-five cargo ships. In late September, the strike of over 4,000 workers in the machine sewing industry, the slowdown of workers in the Public Utilities Bureau on October 2nd, and the slowdown of the rice industry on September 4th were also large-scale labor actions that were city-wide.
    In addition to Shanghai, labor unrest in other areas is also expanding. In Guangzhou, slowdowns demanding wage increases occurred successively in the middle of September among bus drivers and conductors, tailors, sailors, and watch factories. Workers in various private and "state-run" factories in Tianjin also went on slowdowns to demand wage increases in proportion to the rising prices of coal, grain, and oil. Among them, the slowdown of workers at "Zhongfang" lasted for ten days. Silk reeling workers in Wuxi repeatedly went on strike over wage issues. The large-scale strike on September 22nd involved tens of thousands of male and female workers from over 70 silk factories throughout the county. Workers in the Minsheng Machinery Factory in Chongqing and all drivers and mechanics on the Sichuan-Hunan Highway also went on strike in mid-September. Labor unrest in the Jiang-controlled areas of Northeast China was also initiated by the strike of trolley workers in Changchun on October 6th. Electric repair workers in Qingdao, Chongqing, Kunming, Chengdu, Luzhou, and even Xi'an, rose up in opposition to layoffs and wage cuts in September. Railway employees also opposed layoffs and wage cuts. More than 10,000 laid-off and unemployed employees of the Pingjin Railway Bureau gathered at the bureau on September 5th to petition, and over 1,000 employees in Kaifeng on the Longhai Railway also launched a strike movement in mid-October. In addition, hundreds of thousands of rickshaw pullers and rickshaw owners across the country have also united since August to form a national federation to fight against the ban on rickshaws, petitioning and holding meetings to protest. Although the Kuomintang authorities have not approved the establishment of the federation, the rickshaw pullers' movement for unity and self-help continues to expand.
    The surging labor unrest in various regions is ignited by the current severe national crisis and Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous, dictatorial, and civil war policies. American goods are pouring in, the national industry is increasingly bankrupt, factories are closing down one after another, and workers continue to be thrown into the bitter sea of unemployment in large numbers. In Shanghai, in addition to the 300,000 workers who were already unemployed, the closure of the Longhua Cement Factory, the Yangzi Tin Foil Factory, and the Central Glass Factory in September due to the dumping of American goods resulted in the unemployment of more than 500 workers. Eight factories, including Ansi Silk Factory, Hezhong Tobacco Factory, and Daming Toothbrush Factory, reduced production, and more than a thousand workers were laid off. Similar facts are too numerous to mention. Therefore, workers cannot but fight for the right to continue working. More than 400 unemployed workers from the Longhua Cement Factory jointly petitioned. According to statistics from the Shanghai authorities, among the 167 labor disputes in Shanghai in September, those caused by layoffs, shutdowns, and dismissals accounted for 38%, ranking first among all types of labor disputes. It can be seen that large-scale unemployment caused by the national industrial crisis is increasingly becoming the main factor stimulating labor unrest.
    The Jiang government relies on currency inflation to supply its anti-people civil war, and prices continue to rise, especially after the exchange rate adjustment in August, prices soared. However, the cost-of-living index stipulated by the Jiang government, "on which wages are based," lags far behind prices. Moreover, a "wage income tax" of 2% is levied, and some factories even refuse to issue wages based on the cost-of-living index. As a result, workers' wages are decreasing day by day, becoming another important reason for stimulating labor unrest. Statistics on labor disputes in Shanghai in September show that those arising from demands for adjustment of benefits accounted for 23%, ranking second among all types of labor disputes.
    The Jiang government's military spending on the civil war is increasing day by day, while implementing layoffs and wage cuts in public utilities such as telecommunications, railways, and postal services. This is the third reason for the occurrence of labor unrest in the past three months. Petitions and resistance from telecommunications and railway employees in various places have arisen for this reason.
    The Jiang government's ban on rickshaws in major cities under the pretext of "humanitarianism" in order to promote the sale of American cars is the cause of labor unrest among hundreds of thousands of rickshaw pullers.
    In addition, labor unrest caused by the Jiang government's trampling on workers' human rights and suppressing workers' democratic movements is also increasing. In Shanghai, it is not uncommon for the reactionaries to collude with capitalists to dismiss and arrest worker leaders on false pretenses. For example, in September, the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau arrested 20 representatives of bathhouse workers, causing more than 2,000 workers in the industry to petition. In mid-October, the Dagong Textile Company dismissed more than 30 worker leaders on false pretenses, causing protests from all workers. The reason for the strike of trolley workers in Changchun was the oppression of workers by the Jiang army.
    The great struggle of over 500,000 workers in Chiang Kai-shek's controlled areas in the past three months reflects the deepening crisis of Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous and dictatorial rule and the severity of the Chinese national crisis. It can be asserted that the further this crisis develops, the more intense the workers' self-defense struggle for survival and freedom will become.

### 蒋管区三个月来的工潮

    蒋管区三个月来的工潮
    三个月来，特别是自八月下旬以来，蒋管区各工潮又趋高涨，各地工人卷入者五十万人以上。
    全国工业中心的上海，七、八、九、三个月共发生工潮五百六十一件，平均每个月一百八十七件，较上半年（共六百四十二件，参加人数三十一万余人，平均每月一百零七件），增加百分之七十四以上。尤以八月下旬以后，不断发生大规模的罢工与怠工，工潮包括米粮、水泥、制鞋、染织、缝纫、烟草、罐头、南货、钟表修理、书局装订、船厂、轮船装卸、公共汽车、及人力车等十业，其中以八月三十日全市南货业一千余家，三万工人的罢工和坚持十二天，冻结二十五艘货船的轮船装卸工人三千余人的罢工，规模最大。九月下旬，机制缝纫业四千余人的罢工，十月二日公用管理局工人的怠工，以及九月四日米粮业的怠工等，亦均为全市一致行动的大工潮。
    除上海外，其他各地工潮，亦正日渐扩大，广州于九月一月中，先后发生公共汽车司机车员、缝衣匠、海员、及钟表厂各业要求增资的怠工。天津各民营“国营”工厂工人，亦为要求按煤粮油各物上涨比例增加工资而怠工，其中“中纺”工人之怠工，为时十天。无锡缫丝工人屡为工资问题罢工，九月二十二日之大罢工，全县七十余家丝厂男女工数万人，一齐卷入。重庆民生机器厂和川湘公路全体司机机工等业，亦于九月中罢工。东北蒋管区之工潮，亦因十月六日长春电车工人的罢工而发端。青、渝、昆、蓉、筑，乃至西安等各地电修工人，于九月间纷起反对裁员减薪。铁路员工方面，亦因反对裁员减薪，平津路局被裁失业员工万余人，于九月五日齐集路局请愿，陇海路开封员工千余人，亦于十月中旬发动罢工运动。此外全国数十万人力车夫及车商，自八月份起，亦团结起来，筹组全国性联合会，为反对取缔人力车而斗争，纷纷请愿及集会控诉。国民党当局对该联合会之成立，虽不予批准，但人力车夫的团结自救运动，现仍继续扩展中。
    澎湃各地的工潮是目前严重的民族危机与蒋介石卖国独裁内战所激起的，美国商品滚滚倾销，民族工业日趋破产，工厂纷纷关门，工人继续大批的被投入失业苦海，在上海除三十万工人早已失业外，九月间由于陇华水泥厂，扬子锡纸厂，中央玻璃厂三家工厂，因美货倾销被迫关闭，即有五百余工人失业。安斯绸厂、合众烟厂、大明牙刷厂等八家工厂减产，被解雇的工人亦有千余人之多，类此事实，不胜枚举。因此工人不能不为要求继续工作而抗争，龙华水泥厂四百余失业工人，即联合请愿，据沪市当局统计，九月份上海一六七件工潮中，因解雇停业遣散而引起的，共占百分之三十八，占各类工潮首位。可见由于民族工业危机而造成工人大批失业，正日益成为激发工潮的主要因素。
    蒋政府依靠通货膨涨来供应反人民内战，物价继续高潮，特别是八月调整汇率后，物价暴涨，而蒋政所府规定的生活指数“工资以此为依据”，远落后于物价。又抽取百分之二的“工资所得税”，甚至有些厂家，还拒绝依照生活指数为发工资之标准。因此工人工资在相形之下，日益降低，成为激发工潮之另一重要原因。九月份上海劳资纠纷统计，说明因要求调整待遇而发生者共达百分之二十三，占各类工潮的第二位。
    蒋政府内战军费日增，而对于电讯、铁路、邮政等各公用事业，则实行裁员减薪，这是三个月来工潮发生的第三个原因。各地电讯铁路员工的请愿及反抗，即因此而起。
    蒋政府为了推销美国汽车，在“人道”的借口下，取缔各大城市的人力车，则为数十万车夫工潮的起因。
    此外由于蒋政府摧残工人人权，及镇压工人民主运动而激起的工潮，也日渐增加。在上海因反动派与资方勾结，借故开除及无故逮捕工人领袖而发生的工潮，已屡见不鲜。例如九月间沪市警察局，逮捕浴室工人代表二十人，引起该业二千余工人请愿。十月中，大公纺织公司借故开除工人领袖三十余人，引起全体工人抗议。而长春电车工人之罢工，其原因就是蒋军欺压工人。
    蒋介石统治区三个月来五十万人以上工人伟大的抗争，反映出蒋介石卖国独裁统治危机的深刻化，与中国民族危机的严重性。这一危机越向前发展，工人为生存为自由的自卫抗争将日益激烈，是可以断言的。
