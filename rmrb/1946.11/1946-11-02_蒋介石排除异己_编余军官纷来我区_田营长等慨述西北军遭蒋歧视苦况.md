【Our Newspaper, Weixian, 28th】Chiang Kai-shek is eliminating dissidents, and disbanded officers are flocking to our liberated areas. Tian Shijun, former officer of the 25th Route Army of the Northwest Army and current Deputy Battalion Commander of the 32nd Division, along with Platoon Leader Li Jipin, and Yu Zonghui, chemical defense officer of the 3rd Battalion of the 368th Regiment of the 123rd Brigade of the 41st Army, abandoned the darkness for the light and came to our liberated areas. The leaders of our military region warmly received them and assigned them to study in the training corps. When the reporter visited them on the 21st of this month, Deputy Battalion Commander Tian spoke of the harsh treatment he had received: "Our 25th Route Army originally had over 100,000 men. In the 26th year [1937], Chiang Kai-shek reduced it to the 32nd Division, leaving only 4,000 men. Mr. Feng Yuxiang said in Shashi: 'Our Northwest Army has a glorious history of resistance against Japan, and now there is only one division left. You must work hard and be careful that Chiang Kai-shek does not disband you again...'” At this point, Deputy Battalion Commander Tian choked up, and Platoon Leader Li shed tears. Wiping away his tears, Deputy Battalion Commander Tian continued: "The brothers of the former Northwest Army, no matter how good they are, can never be promoted. The promotion and replacement of division commanders are all done by people from the Whampoa Military Academy. Those who have made contributions in the war against Japan are turned into those who have not, small mistakes become big mistakes, and those who have done nothing wrong are found fault with. Therefore, I sadly retired. After retiring, I drifted to ×xi in Jiangxi to sell cigarettes, but I still could not make a living. Later, through a friend's introduction, I decided to break through the layers of blockade and come here..." Platoon Leader Li raised his thin face and said angrily: "I have been working for fourteen years and participated in the famous battles of Taierzhuang, Shanghai, Nanjing, and Wuhan. During the Battle of Wuhan, Chiang Kai-shek was determined to eliminate us. After a full-scale retreat, he ordered us to defend for one day and one night. After the Political Consultative Conference, under the pretext of streamlining the army and eliminating miscellaneous troops, he ordered us to go to Shangrao for reorganization. As a result, the troops had not yet arrived, but the reorganization list was issued. All cadres above the rank of battalion commander were removed from their posts, and the brothers were divided into the 25th and 19th Armies. Now there is not even a small sprout of the 25th Route Army left. All the officers are sad and resentful. Our regimental commander, Zhang Zhenrong, would rather sell cigarettes in Jiangxi than go to the officer training corps. I hope that the brothers of the Northwest Army will go on strike and come to the liberated areas to seek righteous deeds." Officer Yu Zonghui said angrily: "When I entered the cadre training class of the 41st Army, my initial wish was to serve the country, but after the Japanese devils surrendered, I was forced to join the civil war and slaughter my own compatriots. In late June, after seeing Chairman Mao's statement against US aid to Chiang in Xuchang, I was awakened and determined to break away from the darkness and come to the liberated areas, willing to join hands with the people and fight together."

　　蒋介石排除异己
    编余军官纷来我区
    田营长等慨述西北军遭蒋歧视苦况
    【本报威县二十八日电】蒋介石排除异己，编余军官纷纷来我解放区。前西北军二十五路军官、现三十二师副营长田士俊，偕排长李继品及四十一军一二三旅三六八团三营防毒军官虞宗悔，弃暗投明，来我解放区。我军区首长予以殷切招待后，即分派教导队学习。记者于本月二十一日前往访问时，田副营长谈到受苛待情形称：“我们二十五路军，原有十几万人，二十六年经蒋介石缩编为三十二师，仅剩四千人。冯玉祥先生在沙市讲话说：“我们西北军有过光荣的抗战历史，现在只剩一师人了，你们要好好干，提防蒋介石再编散…………”提到这里，田副营长哽咽了，李排长流了泪。田副营长揩着泪，又继称：“原西北军的弟兄们，不管多好，总是升不上去，师长的升缺调补，都由黄埔军校派人。抗战有功者，变无功，小过者变大过，无错者找个岔子。因此我伤心退伍了，退伍后流落江西×溪卖纸烟，生活仍无法维持，后经过朋友的介绍，方决心穿过层层封锁，来到这里……………”李排长仰起瘦削的脸，愤恨的说：“我干了十四年了，曾参加过著名的台儿庄、上海、南京、武汉保卫战，武汉保卫战时，蒋介石居心消灭我们，当全线撤退后，却命令我们死守一昼夜。政协会后，假借缩编消除杂牌，命令我们到上饶整补。结果兵马未到，编整表却下达了，营长以上干部全部掉差，弟兄们分编到二十五军、十九军去了。现在二十五路一个连的小根芽都没有了，各个军官莫不伤心痛恨，我们团长张振荣宁在江西卖纸烟，也不到军官队去。我希望西北军的弟兄们，实行罢战，都到解放区来谋义举。”虞宗悔军官气愤的说：“我进四十一军干训班，初愿本是报效祖国，不料日寇投降后，却被迫加入内战，屠杀自己同胞。六月下旬，在许昌见到毛主席反对美国援蒋的声明后，使我清醒了，决心脱离黑暗来解放区，愿与人民携手，共同奋斗。”
