Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th: (Hong Kong Dispatch) The Hong Kong and Kowloon All Circles Anti-Civil War Grand Alliance, which has been in preparation for several months, held its inaugural meeting on October 27th at the Taiping Theater here. Attendees included Mr. Peng Zemin, Mr. Feng Yufang, Mr. Qian Jiaju, Mr. Zhang Wen, and other veteran revolutionaries, prominent scholars, businessmen, workers, women, and others, totaling more than 2,500 people. Mr. Feng Yufang, representing the presidium, delivered the opening speech, calling on the people of the whole country to rise up and demand an immediate cessation of the civil war, to urge the government to implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, to establish a coalition government of all parties and non-party members, and to demand the withdrawal of American troops from China. Subsequently, Mr. Zeng Wei, Mr. Zhang Wen, and others delivered speeches. The assembly elected Peng Zemin, Li Langru, Zhang Wen, Chen Shuqu, Zhang Zhengming, Ye Wei@, Qian Jiaju, Feng Yufang, and others, totaling nineteen people, as directors. The assembly also passed the Alliance's declaration of establishment, a letter to the compatriots of the whole country, Kuomintang soldiers, and the American people. The atmosphere was enthusiastic, and the meeting adjourned amidst shouts of slogans such as "Overseas Chinese in Hong Kong and Kowloon Unite," "Oppose the National Assembly Convened by One Party," and "Oppose Conscription of Soldiers, Grain, and Labor."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th: The full text of the letter from the Hong Kong and Kowloon All Circles Anti-Civil War Grand Alliance to Kuomintang soldiers is as follows: Soldiers of the whole country!

    At this time when peace is on the verge of collapse, national division is imminent, and civil war is bound to continue for a long and cruel period, we, the broad masses of overseas Chinese in Hong Kong and Kowloon, would like to make an urgent appeal to you! The American weapons you are holding were obtained by sacrificing and selling out national sovereignty. The muzzles of your guns are pointed at your own compatriots. You are attacking areas that have already gained democracy and freedom. For whom are you fighting? You are only fighting for traitorous dictators! Not only will you not gain any sympathy from the people, on the contrary, the people will only hate you! "You didn't die in the eight-year war of resistance, it would be truly wrong to die in the civil war!" I believe you all think so. Moreover, it is difficult to resolve the hatred you have forged with the people. The people of the whole country long for peace, and most of you officers and soldiers are tired of civil war and hope to return home to live and work in peace. Therefore, our only request to you is to withdraw from the civil war by all means! Many of your superiors, officers, and colleagues have already withdrawn from the civil war by laying down their weapons and running away, and these are all glorious and righteous actions. If you can express your opposition to the civil war through action, the few warmongering and bloodthirsty generals will have no way to continue fighting. Although there are many American guns and cannons, they will all become useless if no one uses them. We sincerely advise and hope that you will refuse rebellious orders for civil war! If you are forced onto the battlefield, find an opportunity to lay down your weapons gloriously in front of the people!

　　港九各界成立反内战大同盟
    劝告蒋军拒绝内战乱命
    你们的美国武器，是出卖国家主权换来的！你们八年抗战没有死，死在内战实在冤枉！
    【新华社延安二十日电】香港讯：筹备数月的香港、九龙各界反内战大同盟，成立大会已于十月二十七日假此间太平戏院举行。到会者计有彭泽民、冯裕芳、千家驹、张文诸氏及其他革命老前辈、名学者、商人、工人、妇女等二千五百余人，首由冯裕芳先生代表主席团致开会词，呼吁全国人民起来要求立即停止内战，督促政府实行政协决议，成立各党派及无党派的联合政府，要求美军撤离中国。接着有曾伟、张文等氏发表演说，大会选出彭泽民、李朗如、张文、陈树渠、张正明、叶维＠、千家驹、冯裕芳等十九人为理事，复通过同盟成立宣言，告全国同胞国民党将士及美国人民书等。群情热烈，在高呼“港九侨胞团结起来”，“反对一党召开的国民大会”，“反对征兵征粮征工”等口号声中散会。
    【新华社延安二十日电】香港九龙各界反内战大同盟告国民党将士书全文如次：全国的将士们！
    当此和平已频绝境，全国分裂迫于眉睫，内战势必长期残酷地延续之时，我们港九广大侨胞谨向你们作迫切的呼吁！你们拿着的美国武器，是断送出卖国家主权换来的。你们的枪口对着的，是自己的同胞。你们进攻的，是已获民主自由的地区。你们为谁打仗？只是为了卖国独裁者打仗！你们不但不能获得人民的任何同情，相反的，人民对你们只有憎恨！“八年抗战没有死，死在内战实在冤枉！”相信你们都会这样想。何况，和人民结下了仇恨，是难以解消的。全国人民渴望和平，你们大多数官兵都厌恶内战，都希望回返家园安居乐业。那么，我们对你们的唯一要求，就是用一切方法退出内战！现在已经有不少你们的上级官兵和同事用放下武器和逃跑的方式退出内战了，这都是光荣正义的行动。你们能够以行动来表达你们反对内战的意向，少数好战嗜杀的将军们就没有办法再打下去。美国的枪炮虽然多，但没有人去使用便都成为废物。我们热诚地劝告和盼望你们，拒绝内战乱命！万不得已被迫上了战场，便找机会在人民的面前光荣地放下武器！
