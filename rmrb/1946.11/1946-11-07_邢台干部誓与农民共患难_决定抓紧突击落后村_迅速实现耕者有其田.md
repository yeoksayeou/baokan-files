　　[Reported by this newspaper] The Xingtai County Democratic Government held a mobilization meeting for county and district cadres from the six districts in eastern Xingtai on the 24th and 25th in its resident location. The meeting thoroughly discussed how to launch a broad guerrilla war and achieve comprehensive resistance. All the cadres expressed extremely high confidence and enthusiasm for the war. They all said in an almost oath-like tone, "We will share life and death, weal and woe, with the liberated masses of the entire county. Anyone who wants to run west is a disgrace!" They will also express this attitude to the masses at mass mobilization meetings for war in all districts and key villages throughout the county. Most of the cadres carried short guns, showing great heroism. They all possess extremely rich experience in guerrilla warfare from the past War of Resistance Against Japan. They all say: Now that the masses have largely been liberated, we have the support of the masses. Even if Chiang Kai-shek has the help of his American daddy, he won't gain anything. Through this meeting, everyone has a correct understanding of the current war strategy, and the paralysis that previously existed, thinking that the Kuomintang army could not come, has been thoroughly liquidated. The meeting made specific arrangements for organizing guerrilla groups, eliminating traitors, transferring the masses, clearing the fields, and rapidly completing land reform in backward villages. Currently, the military and civilians throughout the county have entered a state of extreme pre-war tension.

　　邢台干部誓与农民共患难
    决定抓紧突击落后村
    迅速实现耕者有其田
    【本报讯】邢台县民主政府，于二十四、五两日在驻地召开邢东六个区，县区干部动员大会，对于怎样开展广泛的游击战争，实现全面抵抗，作了极详细的讨论，全体干部对战争的信心和热情极高。他们都以宣誓般的口吻说：“我们要和全县翻身群众同生死共患难，谁想朝西跑，就是耻辱！”他们并将在全县各区各基点村的群众战争动员大会上，向群众表明这种态度。大部分干部身挎短枪，英气勃勃，他们都在过去抗日战争中保有极丰富的游击战争经验。都说：现在群众大部翻身，我们有了群众依靠，蒋介石就是有他的美国爸爸帮助也不沾。经过这次会议，大家对目前的战争方针都已有了正确认识，对过去认为国民党军队来不了的麻痹心理，作了彻底清算。会议对组织游击集团、除奸、群众转移、空室清野及迅速完成落后村土地改革等都有具体布置。现全县军民已进入极紧张的战前工作中。
