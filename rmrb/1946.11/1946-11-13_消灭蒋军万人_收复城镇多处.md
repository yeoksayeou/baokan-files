Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th: Amidst the great victories of the People's Liberation Army in annihilating the entire 25th Division of the Chiang army in Andong and Kuandian, annihilating most of Liu Ruming's forces in Juancheng, southwestern Shandong, and annihilating three and a half brigades of the Chiang army in Lianshui, northern Jiangsu, the people's morale is boosted and morale is high. In the above three battles, the invading army suffered a total loss of 25,000 men, and the offensive was greatly frustrated. In the past week, the people's armed forces continued to fight heroically, recovered many towns, and annihilated another 10,000 Chiang troops. The Shandong Eighth Route Army repelled the Chiang army invading from Yixian, Taierzhuang, and Linyi on the southern front, and recovered the important town of Lanling. On the eastern section of the Jiaoji Railway, Nanji liberated Anqiu City on the 5th, thereby consolidating the security of the northern part of the coastal area. In this battle, 2,500 Chiang and puppet troops were captured, and 700 were killed or wounded. A main force of the Chiang army invading Jiaodong has been annihilated by more than 1,000 people in the Pingdu area. After suffering a severe blow in front of the strong Lianshui position of the New Fourth Army, the Chiang army in northern Jiangsu retreated to the area between Huai'an and Huaiyin and has lost its ability to invade, urgently awaiting reinforcements and recuperation. The New Fourth Army continued to expand its victories and recently recovered the important town of Qingong between Lianshui and Huaiyin. The four invading Chiang armies in northern Henan were defeated in Linxian, suffering a total loss of more than 1,000 people and retreated to their original locations. In early November, northern Shanxi launched an effective counterattack, recovering Guoxian, Yuanping, and Sanjiao Town, 20 miles west of Xinxian, in one fell swoop. A total of 1,500 Yan troops were annihilated. A division of the 94th Corps of the Chiang army, which was advancing along the Pinghan Railway, ventured into the Shancha area of Yixian from Laishui, and was completely defeated by the Eighth Route Army 20 miles west of Laishui on the 4th, annihilating more than 1,000 people. The Eighth Route Army in eastern Hebei continued to recover dozens of villages and towns occupied by the Chiang army last week. The important town of Qukou between Xianghe and Baodi was also attacked by the people's armed forces. In this battle, 1,200 Chiang troops were killed or captured.
