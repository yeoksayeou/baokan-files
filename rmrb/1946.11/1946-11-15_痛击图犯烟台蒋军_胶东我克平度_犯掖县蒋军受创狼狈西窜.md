Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th: The Chiang armies in the eastern and central sections of the Jiaoji Railway, in late October, invaded the Jiaodong Liberated Area in two routes, attempting to attack Yantai from the flanks. The western route, the Chiang army's 8th Army, 166th Division, and the 1st Honored Division, which invaded Changyi, continued to invade Meicun and other places west of the Wei River on both sides of Changyi, covering more than a thousand puppet troops of Zhang Tianzuo and others, building fortifications in the Taibaozhuang area southeast of Changyi, attempting to control the western section of Yantai-Weifang. The 8th Army's 108th Division concentrated in Hanting, fifty miles east of Tanxian. At the same time, the eastern route, the Chiang army's 54th Army, concentrated around Jiaoxian, its defense being taken over by the Provisional 12th Division, the 10th Traffic Police Corps, the 2nd Garrison Brigade, and the 46th Division newly transferred from Hainan Island. After piecing together a force of about two armies, they began their invasion on the 30th. The 8th Army and the 54th Army jointly attacked Pingdu from Changyi and Jiaoxian. The Eighth Route Army annihilated more than 2,000 men of the Chiang army's main force, the 8th Army, in the western suburbs of Pingdu, and on the dawn of the 3rd of this month, it took the initiative to move to the suburbs to resist. After the Chiang army entered the city, the 54th Army was left to occupy Pingdu, and the 8th Army advanced to peep at Yexian. The Eighth Route Army took advantage of the emptiness in their rear and liberated Anqiu city on the 5th, killing and capturing more than 3,200 Chiang and puppet troops. On the 7th, it took the initiative to move to the suburbs, waiting for an opportunity to annihilate the enemy's living forces, and recovered the Zhilanzhuang station on the Jiaoji Railway, ten kilometers southeast of Gaomi, killing and capturing more than 40 members of the 15th Traffic Police Corps, seizing 30 American-made Thompson submachine guns and other rifles, 32 large carts of military supplies, and destroying a railway bridge and more than ten miles of railway tracks (Jiaoxian to Weixian section). The Chiang army along the Jiaoji line was greatly shocked. The 54th Army had to withdraw troops to aid the rear. The Eighth Route Army recovered Pingdu city on the 5th. At this point, the Chiang army's 8th Army, which had invaded Yexian, was isolated. Its 103rd Division, 309th Regiment, suffered a devastating blow by the Eighth Route Army in the suburbs on the 7th. The regimental commander was wounded, and hundreds of corpses, including the deputy regimental commander, were abandoned as they fled west in a panic. In this battle, the Eighth Route Army captured one rocket launcher, three anti-tank guns, two mortars, twenty-one light and heavy machine guns, and many rifles and ammunition. On the morning of the 8th, the Chiang army reorganized its forces and attacked again. The two sides are currently engaged in fierce fighting.
