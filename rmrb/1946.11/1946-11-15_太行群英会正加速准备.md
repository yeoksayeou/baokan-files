    Taihang Heroes Meeting Accelerating Preparations
    [This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch] The Taihang Heroes Meeting is approaching, and all preparations are being accelerated. Each county has successively convened Heroes' Congresses to select heroes and collect exhibits. The meeting site and exhibition hall have been repaired, and special personnel have been sent to nearby counties to directly collect exhibits. The exhibition hall is divided into two sections: one is the production hall, including the emancipation hall, and the other is the militia hall, including the current affairs hall. The arrangement of the exhibition hall will be based on the following principles: 1. Emphasizing physical object exhibitions. 2. Emphasizing the development process. 3. Highlighting key points. The exhibition of an item should aim to raise questions and solve problems. 4. Reduce comic strips in picture exhibitions, and focus on prominent large paintings. The meeting staff is working very hard, and the masses near the meeting site are also doing their best to help.
