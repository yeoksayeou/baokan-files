    [Our newspaper, Yangcheng, 14th dispatch] The heroic story of Guo Guixiang, a female teacher from Subao, remaining unyielding until death, is circulating in the Hongtong area. After the Chiang troops occupied Subao, Guo Guixiang returned to Subao on the 21st of last month to scout, and was captured by the Chiang troops and taken to the regimental headquarters of the 157th Regiment. They began by torturing her physically, but she remained unyielding and cursed the Chiang troops as "inhuman things, conscienceless bastards." The Chiang troops beat her again and asked her, "Are the Eighth Route Army good or not?" She said without hesitation, "Good, good, the people of the Eighth Route Army are good, the Communist Party's propositions are good, Mao Zedong is good." The Chiang troops used beatings to stop her words and threatened her, asking, "Why is the Central Army not good?" Guo Guixiang angrily replied, "How can traitors be good? How can killing ordinary people be good? How can looting be good?" The Chiang troops' interrogation failed, and they decided to execute her. Guo Guixiang clenched her teeth, invigorated her spirit, and was tied up and walked down the street, shouting, "Long live the Communist Party! Long live Mao Zedong! Long live the Eighth Route Army!" "Chiang Kai-shek, the traitor, will be notorious for ten thousand years..." Her determination represented the righteousness of the Chinese people and moved the villagers to tears for her. Guo Guixiang was shot and killed by the bandits raised by Chiang Kai-shek, but this is a great encouragement to the people. Let the hatred for Chiang Kai-shek grow even stronger, and the people will avenge Guo Guixiang.

    【本报阳城十四日电】洪洞一带传说着苏堡女教员郭桂香至死不屈的壮烈史迹。蒋军侵占苏堡后，上月二十一日郭桂香回到苏堡去侦察，被蒋军抓至一五七团团部。开始便以毒打摧残她的肉体，但是她毫不屈服的大骂蒋军“不通人性的东西，丧了良心的坏蛋”。蒋军又是一阵毒打向她说：“八路军好不好？”她毫不迟疑说：“好，好，八路军的人好，共产党的主张好，毛泽东好”。蒋军以毒打来制止她的话，并恫吓地问：“中央军为什么不好？”郭桂香愤然答道：“卖国贼还能好？杀老百姓还能好？抢东西还能好？”蒋军的刑讯失败了，决定要枪毙她。郭桂香咬紧牙关，振奋精神，被绑着走在街上，高呼：“共产党万岁！毛泽东万岁！八路军万岁！”“蒋介石卖国贼遗臭万年。………”她的坚决代表了中国人民的正气，激动了村里的老百姓为她流泪。郭桂香被蒋介石豢养的强盗所枪杀了，这对人民却是个很大的鼓励，让对蒋介石的仇恨更增涨吧，人们将为郭桂香复仇。
