    Militia Active Along the Daokou-Qinghua Railway Line, Destroying Traitorous Puppet Chiang Kai-shek Special Agent Regime; Chiang's Blockade Ineffective, We Still Pass Unhindered
    [This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch] In the Yu Bei region of the western section of the Daokou-Qinghua Railway, special agents who took the opportunity to be active during the Chiang army's invasion have been gradually suppressed under the attack of the broad masses of organized people, armed work teams, and guerrilla units. In the vast rural areas south of the road, the masses organized the surveillance of special agents within the villages as soon as the Chiang army invaded. In the villages near the Chiang army strongholds along the Daokou-Qinghua Railway, Chiang's special agents and traitorous elements took the opportunity to restore the puppet regime, but were destroyed in large numbers by our militia and armed work teams. Han, the political commissar of the Fifth District of Bo'ai County, led an armed work team to operate in the area east of the city, and on the 18th of last month, captured a special agent in ×× village who had appointed himself as a puppet bao chief to maintain the Chiang army. He Shuzhou, a Chiang's special agent from the Xia Shuimo village of the Second District of the county, took the opportunity to demand grain and money and exploit the masses, and was also captured by our armed work team on the 20th. The masses are determined to fight against the enemy and defend their own country. They said: "Chiang Kai-shek is sitting on a glass country that will soon be shattered." Due to the widespread development of our guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines, Chiang's blockade line along the Daokou-Qinghua Railway has not prevented us from traveling north and south unhindered. The Chiang army's attempts to intrude into the mountains have also been attacked by our frontal and rear militia and guerrilla units. The militia on both banks of the Dan River in the Sixth District of Bo'ai County are fighting every day. On the 17th of last month, Xi, the political commissar of the Sixth District of the county, sacrificed himself while leading the militia in combat. Under the slogan of revenge, the militia of that team forcibly attacked the Chiang puppet stronghold in Huocun the next day, killing two members of the homecoming corps. Also: Along the Daokou-Qinghua Railway, more than 10,000 refugees who retreated with us to the northern mountainous area have been comforted and resettled by our government. The young and middle-aged people are organized into transportation teams to engage in transportation for a living, women are given cotton loans to engage in weaving, and the old and weak are provided with food by the government for relief. The masses in various villages in the mountains are also extremely concerned about the refugees, lending them houses and goods.

    道清沿线民兵驰骋
    摧毁奸伪蒋特政权
    蒋军封锁无效我仍通行无阻
    【本报长治讯】道清西段豫北地区，蒋军进犯时乘机活动的特务，在广大有组织的群众、武工队、游击队打击下，已逐渐被镇压下去。路南广大农村，在蒋军进犯时，群众即对村内特务进行了有组织的监视。道清沿线蒋军据点附近村庄，蒋特与奸伪分子乘机复辟组织伪政权，在我民兵、武工队打击下，被摧毁甚多。博爱五区韩政委带领武工队在城东一带活动，上月十八日在××村将自任伪保长，维持蒋军之特务捕获。该县二区下水磨村蒋特贺书洲乘机要粮要款，渔肉群众，亦被我武工队于二十日捕获。群众对敌斗争、保卫自己的江山、意志坚强。他们说：“蒋介石坐的是玻璃江山只有一阵阵。”由于我敌后游击战广泛开展，蒋军之道清封锁线，我仍南北通行无阻。蒋军向山地窜扰，亦遭受我正面与敌后民兵、游击队的夹击。博爱六区丹河两岸民兵，无日不在战斗。上月十七日，该县六区奚政委领导民兵作战牺牲，该队民兵在复仇口号下，第二日即强袭获村蒋伪据点，击毙还乡团二名。又：道清沿线，随我退至路北山地的万余难民，已经我政府分别抚恤安置，青壮年则组织运输队，从事运输谋生，妇女贷给棉花，进行纺织，老弱则由政府拨粮救济。山地各村群众，对难民借房借物，亦极关心。
