　　People's Heroes
    Large Numbers Emerge in Central China
    [Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 4th] During the Central China Self-Defense War, a large number of people's heroes emerged. For example:
    (1) Old Woman Xu Hands Over a Cannon
    One evening in mid-July, in ×× Village, Chengsi Township, Chema Lake District, Rugao, a 68-year-old woman, Old Woman Xu, was sitting outside her door enjoying the cool air. Suddenly, a dark figure crept out of the fields and grabbed her, saying, "Give me something to eat." Old Woman Xu, hearing his trembling voice and seeing his furtive movements, suspected he was not a good person. She coaxed him, saying, "Okay! Wait for me to get it from the house." Noticing he had no weapon in his hand, she unexpectedly hit him over the head with a stick, desperately hugged him, and shouted, "I've caught a reactionary!" The people around heard and rushed over. Sure enough, it was a Kuomintang soldier who had retreated from the Rugao battle. After a stern interrogation, they learned that there were still weapons and people in the fields. Everyone took hand grenades, hoes, and nails to search the fields, and they captured a small cannon, a Zhongzheng rifle, and another Kuomintang soldier alive.
    (2) Old Man Xu Captured Eleven Guns
    On August 11th, the New Fourth Army liberated Libao Town (east of Hai'an). That night, twelve scattered Kuomintang soldiers stayed in ×× Village, Lizao Township, and dragged in Old Man Xu, who was over sixty years old, asking him to lead them to Rugao. Old Man Xu resolutely refused. The Kuomintang soldiers had no choice but to ask him to point out the road to Rugao. So, Old Man Xu cleverly pointed them towards the Li family's pier, where the New Fourth Army was stationed. These twelve panicked fellows encountered the New Fourth Army sentry that night. As soon as the gunfire sounded, they immediately turned back and hid in the grassy fields. The next day, before dawn, Old Man Xu ran out and saw those fellows still hiding in the fields. He quickly ran to report to the village chief, woke up all the villagers, and together they captured all twelve men alive, and also seized four pistols and eight rifles.
    (3) Zhou Baoxiang's Clever Plan to Capture Prisoners
    Zhou Baoxiang, a farmer from Suqian, encountered nine Kuomintang soldiers on the evening of October 6th, who were retreating after attacking Shaodian (fifty li northeast of Suqian). The Kuomintang soldiers captured him and asked him to lead the way. Zhou Baoxiang came up with a plan in desperation. At dusk, he led them to a township government office in a village east of somewhere. When he was twenty or thirty meters away from the township government office, he said to the Kuomintang soldiers, "Wait here for a moment, let me go in and see if there are any Eighth Route Army soldiers." After he went in and reported, the township chief ordered the staff to disperse and deploy, and shouted, "The first company flanks from the east, the second company flanks from the west, machine guns provide cover!" The Kuomintang soldiers outside the village heard this and trembled with fear. At this time, Zhou came out of the village and said to the Kuomintang soldiers, "It's terrible, there are Eighth Route Army soldiers all around, you can't escape, hurry up and surrender!" He also said a lot about how the Eighth Route Army treated prisoners well. In this way, he subdued and captured nine Kuomintang soldiers, seizing a machine gun and nine rifles.

　　人民英雄
    华中大批涌现
    【新华社华中四日电】华中自卫战中，涌现出大批人民的英雄。例如：
    （一）许老太婆缴炮
    七月中旬的一个晚上，在如皋车马湖区城四乡××村中，一个六十八岁的许老太婆，坐在门外乘凉，忽然一个黑影子，蹑手蹑脚的从田边爬过来，一把抓住她说：“给点东西我吃”。许老太婆听见他颤抖的蛮音，行动又鬼崇，料想他一定不是好人。便哄他说：“好！等我到家里去弄。”又见他手里没有家伙，就猛不防给了他当头一棒，拚命抱住他使劲大喊：“我抓到了一个反动派。”周围的人听到，一齐赶来，果然是如皋战役中溃退下来的蒋军，经严厉的追问盘查以后，才知道原来田里还有武器和人，大家就拿着手榴弹锄头钉又去田里搜查，便又缴获了一门小炮，缴获了一支中正式步枪，还活捉了一个蒋军。
    （二）徐老头缴了十一枝枪
    八月十一日，新四军解放了李堡镇（海安东），当夜有十二个被击散的蒋军，留到李灶乡××村，拖住了六十多岁的徐老头，要他带路到如皋去，徐老头子坚决不肯，蒋军没法，只要他指点去如皋的路。于是徐老头机智的指点他们朝着驻扎新四军的李家墩子走去。这十二个慌慌张张的家伙，当晚就碰到新四军岗哨，枪声一响，他们立刻留回头躲在草田里。第二天天还不大亮，徐老汉跑出来见到那些家伙还躲在田里，就连忙跑去报告村长，把村里人都喊醒，一齐把十二个人都活捉了，还缴获四枝短枪，八枝步枪。
    （三）周宝祥巧计捉俘虏
    宿迁农民周宝祥，在十月六日晚上碰到了九个溃退下来进犯邵店（宿迁东北五十里）的蒋军，蒋军捉住了他，要他带路，周宝祥情急生智，于黄昏中把他们带到东某乡公所，走到离乡公所二三十米时，他就对蒋军说：“你们在这里等一下，让我进去看看，有没有八路。”当他进去报告后，乡长命令办事人员分散布置，并大喊：“第一连到东边包抄，第二连至西面包抄，机枪掩护”，蒋军在庄外听到，吓得发抖，此时周又走出庄来对蒋军说：“不得了，这里周围都是八路军，你们跑不掉，赶快缴枪吧”。并且又说了很多八路军优待俘虏的情形，就这样，驯服地捉住了九个蒋军，缴到一挺机关枪和九枝步枪。
