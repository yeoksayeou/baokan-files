    Yuan Dynasty Honorary Servicemen Lead Rent Reduction
    Futonggu Village Thoroughly Overthrows Feudalism
    Now Consolidating Organizations to Prepare to Defend the Homeland
    [This newspaper's Weixian, 12th dispatch] Under the leadership of honorary servicemen Li Qingshun, Li Degong, and Xu Guangzong, the masses of Futonggu Village, Yuan Dynasty, launched a thorough rent reduction movement. Twelve despotic landlords and one stubborn rich peasant household were thoroughly liquidated, recovering 285 mu of land, 74 brick houses, 55 flat houses, and countless grain and livestock, as well as large guns, box guns, and 76 bullets. After the fruits were distributed, ten extremely poor households each received an average of 5.7 mu of land, and 98 poor peasant households and 68 lower-middle peasant households each received an average of 4 mu. All poor peasants rose to become middle peasants. After the masses obtained land, they actively participated in their own organizations. Before the rent reduction movement, there were a total of 82 peasant association members, 36 militiamen, and 120 women's association members. After the rent reduction, peasant association members increased to 226, militiamen to 56, and women's association members to 150, an increase of 94 percent of the original number. Out of the 891 people in the entire village, 570 participated in various organizations. Through rent reduction, the political rule and economic exploitation of feudal landlords were completely eliminated. The broad masses not only had land to cultivate, houses to live in, and food to eat, but also had means of production. At the celebration meeting for being liberated, every peasant was beaming with joy, thanking Chairman Mao, and setting out plans for the future: 1. Engage in mutual aid in production, be frugal, and eradicate the roots of poverty and plant the roots of prosperity. 2. Consolidate organizations, strengthen class education, and raise class consciousness. 3. Strengthen the militia's work of practicing self-defense to protect their homes, and be ready to support the front lines and defeat Chiang's army's attacks at any time.

    【本报威县十二日电】在荣誉军人李清顺、李德功、许光宗领导下，元朝傅通固村群众掀起彻底查减运动，十二家恶霸地主一家封顽富农都得到彻底清算，追回土地二百八十五亩、砖房七十四间、平房五十五间，粮食牲口无算，另有大枪、盒子及子弹七十六粒。果实分配后十户赤贫每人拉平地五亩七分，九十八户贫农、六十八户贫中农，每人拉平地四亩。全部贫农上升中农。群众得到土地后积极参加自己的组织。查减运动前农会员共八十二名，民兵三十六名，妇会员一百二十名。查减后农会员增至二百二十六名，民兵五十六名，妇会员一百五十名，其发展数字占原有数的百分之九十四。全村八百九十一名群众中就有五百七十人参加了各种组织。经过查减彻底消灭了封建地主的政治统治与经济剥削，广大群众不仅有了地种、有房住、有饭吃、而且有了生产工具。在庆祝翻身大会上，个个农民喜气洋洋，感谢毛主席，并订出今后的计划：一、生产互助，省吃俭用，拔了穷根扎富根。二、巩固组织，加强阶级教育，提高阶级觉悟。三、加强民兵自卫保家的练武工作，随时准备支援前线，打退蒋军的进攻。
