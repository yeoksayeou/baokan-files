Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th. The actions of the U.S. Marines in the Philippines are increasingly arousing resentment among Filipinos. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Manila on the 8th, Filipinos are lodging complaints with the U.S. military and the Philippine government about the atrocities of U.S. troops, pointing out that U.S. Marine Corps sailors at the Olongapo Naval Base are acting like Japanese invaders. The Philippine Free Press quoted complaints from residents of Olongapo, stating that U.S. Marines arbitrarily beat and kick Filipinos, treating them like slaves, and shaved the heads of civil officials for amusement. The newspaper also quoted Judge Rizio, who had reportedly lodged a complaint with the Navy, saying that they were infringing upon Philippine sovereignty and public authority, but there has been no response.
