Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st: A Shenyang dispatch: The houses of most businesses in Shenyang have been forcibly occupied by Chiang Kai-shek's troops. Each time they move, the furniture is emptied out, and those who come later extort from the businesses again. Chiang's troops also arbitrarily search people's homes, and gold, silver, and valuables are all confiscated as "contraband," and even false accusations are made for extortion. When the army builds fortifications, it forcibly conscripts laborers and seizes land, cutting off seedlings. The peasants weep and plead, but it is still unavoidable. Commercial taxes are extremely heavy. A small restaurant needs to pay 120,000 to 150,000 yuan per month. Ordinary citizens, in addition to regular taxes, also have to bear fifteen kinds of exorbitant taxes and levies. The "local troops" of the puppet Manchukuo era, which were incorporated by Chiang Kai-shek's troops, are not paid or given guns, and are ordered to rely on looting the people's livelihoods. There is deep hatred between the "Central Army" and the "local troops." The former calls the latter "malarbazi," and the latter calls the former "southern barbarians." Administrative personnel from the Northeast are subjected to discrimination and called "Northeast natives." Positions above section chief in government agencies are all occupied by Chiang Kai-shek's cronies. The Shenyang concentration camp holds no fewer than 5,000 prisoners, including elderly women and children. In addition, the Beiling No. 1 Prison holds nearly 2,000 political prisoners.

　　沈阳蒋军无恶不作
    【新华社延安一日电】沈阳通讯：沈大部商号的房屋都被蒋军强迫占用，每次迁移，家具一空，后来者又向商号强要。蒋军又随便搜查民宅，金银细软，皆被当作“违禁品”没收，甚至栽赃敲诈。军队修筑堡垒，强征民夫、民地，割除禾苗，农民涕泣恳求，仍不可免。商业捐税奇重，一屯等饭馆，每月需纳十二万至十五万元。一般市民，除正税外，尚需负担十五种苛杂税捐。蒋军收编之伪满时代之“土著军”不发饷，不发枪，令其靠抢劫人民生活。“中央军”与“土著军”间，仇恨甚深，前者呼后者为“妈拉巴子”，后者呼前者为“南蛮子”。东北籍行政人员，备受歧视，被称为“东北土著”，机关科长以上职位，均为蒋记亲信把持。沈阳集中营，拘押人犯不下五千，内中且有老太太及儿童。另北陵第一监狱，拘禁政治犯近两千人。
