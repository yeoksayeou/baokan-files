　　Jinnan Bank Taihang First and Third Branches Summarize Loan Work
    Promote Winter Production, Change Loan Methods
    Licheng Supports Winter Production, Sends Personnel to Rural Areas to Issue Loans
    [Our Newspaper] The Taihang First and Third Branches of Jinnan Bank convened meetings of branch managers in late October to discuss loan issuance work for this winter. After more than ten days of research, they reviewed the shortcomings of past loan work and determined how loans should be issued this winter. During the review, the Third Branch identified the following problems: 1. The cadres' simplistic task-oriented view, without investigation or research, led to the blind issuance of loans from the county to the district and from the district to the village, resulting in loans being issued to those who did not need them and not issued to those who did, as well as loans being issued to those who applied first and not issued to those who applied later. 2. Cadres' paternalism and equal distribution. For example, during the spring loan, Beiqiao Village in Wu'an borrowed 50,000 yuan. The village cadres did not consult with the masses and bought livestock. The contract listed 46 households, but in practice, households with straw were allowed to use it as they pleased, while households without straw were not even allowed to use it for grinding grain. Also, the village chief used 6,800 yuan of the loan to buy cosmetics for his wedding. 3. Loans were held up in the bank and by district and village cadres for long periods of time and could not be delivered to the masses in a timely manner. Regarding how to issue loans, 1. The Third Branch decided to issue loans for both agriculture and sideline occupations simultaneously, in order to lay the foundation for next year's major production from the organization of winter production. In addition, the Third Branch's focus for issuance is: villages with a solid foundation in production work, impoverished villages, and disaster-stricken villages. In terms of specific methods, the Third Branch decided not to regard loan work as purely the bank's task, but to closely integrate with relevant departments and coordinate efforts based on the needs of the masses. They will also publicize the significance of loans to the masses, mobilize the masses to evaluate and distribute loans, and mobilize the masses to check the use of loans themselves. In the issuance of loans, the First Branch specifically issued 4.4 million yuan in credit loans and absorbed a large amount of idle capital to organize credit cooperatives. They also discussed livestock loans, and based on the past method of simply allocating and purchasing livestock, which did not fundamentally solve the problem of animal power, they decided to issue 2.7 million yuan in breeding livestock loans this winter to develop livestock, which must not be used for other purposes. If still insufficient, the branch will be responsible for coordinating the allocation. (Jiemin, Yumin)
    [Our Newspaper] Licheng has decided to loan 8.2 million yuan to support winter production among the masses. In order to issue and use the loans more rationally and overcome the shortcomings of past loans, the county government convened a meeting of county and district staff on the 9th to review past loan issues. Although the amount of loans was considerable, there were significant problems in the issuance, such as delays, complicated procedures, lack of focus, and failure to check the results. In response to the above shortcomings, the future direction was determined, mainly based on the production conditions in various places, with half of the loans to support agriculture and the rest used for textiles, industry, credit cooperatives, and other production activities. In terms of leadership, attention should be paid to reaching out to the countryside, with staff going to the countryside to personally organize and regularly check on the loans. Procedures should be simplified as much as possible. Districts 1, 2, and 3, which are close to the city, can directly apply for loans at the branch. Districts and villages far from the city will have staff bring the loans to the district for distribution to save manpower. Attention should also be paid to accelerating the turnover of loans. Industrial loans will focus on supporting the development of small handicraft factories. In short, this winter's loans must effectively play their role in supporting production. (Zhiping)

　　冀南银行太行一三分行总结贷款工作
    推动冬季生产改变贷款办法
    黎城扶植冬季生产派员下乡发放贷款
    【本报讯】冀南银行太行一、三两分行于十月下旬分别召开各支行经理会议，讨论今冬的发放贷款工作，经过十多日的研究，把过去贷款工作上的缺点做了检讨，并确定了今冬的贷款如何发放。在检讨中三分行检讨出如下几个问题：一、干部的单纯任务观点，不调查不研究，就把贷款由县到区由区到村盲目的发放下去，结果是不需要贷的贷上了，需要贷的没贷上，以及先贷的贷上了，后贷的没贷上。二、干部的包办代替与平均分配，如今春贷款，武安北峭村共贷了五万元，村干部未与群众商讨，便买了头牲口，契约上写的四十六户，但实际使用时，是有草户尽管使用，没草户连推碾磨也不叫使。又村长结婚将贷款六千八百元买了化妆品。三、贷款长期积压在银行与区村干部手中，不能及时放到群众手里。在如何发放上：一、三分行都决定是农副业一并发放，以便从组织冬季生产中，即打下明年的大生产基础。此外，三分行发放的重点是：生产工作有基础的村与贫困村以及受灾村。在具体做法上，三分行决定不把贷款工作单纯看做是银行的任务，要与有关部门密切结合，根据群众要求，统一步调。并多向群众宣传贷款意义，发动群众评议分配，发动群众自己检查贷款用途。一分行在发放贷款中，特发放四百四十万元信用贷款，并吸收大量游资，组织信用合作社。他们还讨论了牲口贷款，根据过去单纯调剂购买的办法，不是基本解决畜力的办法，今冬决定发放繁殖牲口贷款二百七十万元，用以发展牲口，不准挪作别用，如仍不足时，分行负责加以调剂。（捷民、育民）
    （本报讯）黎城为扶植群众冬季生产，特决定贷款八百二十万元。并为更合理的发放使用，克服往年贷款的毛病，县府特于九日召开县区业务员会议，检讨出过去贷款数量虽不少但发放上有很大毛病，如不及时、手续复杂、没有重点、不检查作用等；针对如上缺点确定今后方针，主要根据各地生产情况分配，以半数扶助农业，其他于用纺织、工业、信用合作等生产。领导上注意面向农村，业务员下乡亲自组织经常检查，手续力求简便，如一、二、三区离城近，可直接到支行贷款；离城远的区村，由业务员带款到区上去发放，以节省民力。并注意加速轮转。工业贷款着重扶植手工业小工厂的发展。总之今冬的贷款，必须切实发挥其扶助生产的作用。（支平）
