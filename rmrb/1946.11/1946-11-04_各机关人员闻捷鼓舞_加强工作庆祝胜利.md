The People's Liberation Army Braves on the Jilu Yu Border Achieved Another Great Victory; Personnel in Various Organizations Were Thrilled and Encouraged to Intensify Their Work in Celebration
[This newspaper, Jinji Lu Yu, 2nd dispatch] After the news of another great victory by the People's Liberation Army heroes on the Jinji Lu Yu front spread, cadres in various organizations were visibly delighted. Vice Chairman Xing of the Border Area Assembly said to reporters with a smile: "This victory on the front lines was long expected. It once again proves the brilliance of Commander Liu's commanding genius, and it also proves the incompetence of the Chiang army." The Border Area Government immediately disseminated this victory news to its own organizations and the masses in the驻地 (zhù dì, garrisoned area), who discussed it with great enthusiasm: "Ha! Ha! Another heavy blow to Chiang Kai-shek!" The Border Area Government's guard team spread the word among themselves: "Chiang Kai-shek's transport brigade is really effective, sending Commander Liu more cars again." Staff members of the Department of Civil Affairs, the Court, and the Department of Finance discussed the tales of victory on the front lines in the dining hall, even forgetting to eat: "A few days ago, Commander Liu warned Chiang Kai-shek, and that was a forecast of this victory." Secretary-General Sun told reporters: "After hearing the news of the victory, I was so excited that I couldn't sleep. An indescribable force of excitement was in control of me." The comrades at the telephone bureau have been speaking especially loudly these past few days. They are using the telephone to tell each other about this great victory, which will equip us with several more regular regiments. These past two or three days, comrades and miscellaneous personnel from the military region's political departments have been discussing the news of the front-line victory in an atmosphere of laughter, all expressing their intention to respond to leaders Liu and Deng with intensified work in the rear. After hearing the good news, some of the miscellaneous personnel at the Central Bureau jumped up with joy. Comrade Song Xi, who was sick and unable to move, immediately struggled to get up and participate in the work after hearing the news. Other comrades advised him to rest for a few days, but he shook his head happily and said, "My illness has been cured by Commander Liu." They want to support the front lines by strengthening their practical work and studies, initiating donations to comfort the front-line People's Liberation Army, and sending congratulatory telegrams to leaders Liu and Deng.

　　各机关人员闻捷鼓舞  加强工作庆祝胜利
    【本报晋冀鲁豫二日电】冀鲁豫前线八路军健儿又一大捷的消息传出后，各机关干部，闻讯喜形于色。边参会邢副议长微笑着对记者说：“这次前线的胜利是早已预料到了的，这又一次证明刘司令员的指挥天才的高明，而且也又一次证明了蒋军的无能。”边府马上将此胜利消息传布本机关及驻地群众，群众眉飞色舞的谈论：“哈！哈！又狠狠的给了蒋介石一家伙。”边府警卫队里互相传说着：“蒋介石这个运输大队真起作用，又给刘司令员送汽车来了。”民政厅、法院、财政厅工作人员在饭厅里，连饭都顾不上吃商谈前线胜利佳话：“前几天刘司令员警告蒋介石，就是这次胜利的预告。”孙秘书长告记者说：“我听到胜利消息后，兴奋得睡不着觉，说不出来的一种兴奋力量在支配着我。”电话局同志们在这几天说话声音特别高，他们利用电话互相传说着这一次大胜利，又给咱们装备好几个正规兵团。这两三天来，军区司政各工作同志及杂务人员都在欢笑的生活里谈论着前线胜利消息，均表示在后方以紧张工作来回答刘邓首长。中央局同志们听到此捷音后，一些杂务人员高兴的都跳起来了，病着不能动的宋喜同志听说后，马上挣扎起来参加工作，别的同志劝他休息几天吧，他高兴的摇着头说：“我的病已叫刘司令员给治好了。”他们要以实际工作，加强学习来支援前线，发起捐钱慰劳前方八路军，并给刘邓首长去贺电。
