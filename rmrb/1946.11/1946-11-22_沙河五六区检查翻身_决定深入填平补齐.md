　　Sand River Fifth and Sixth Districts Inspect Emancipation
    Decide to Deepen Leveling and Replenishing
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] To enable the mass movement in the second and third category villages throughout the county to deepen and balance rapidly, the Fifth and Sixth Districts convened a meeting of more than 170 activists from twenty-five second and third category villages (un-thorough or backward villages) such as Dalian Town on October 27th, 28th, and 29th to inspect the degree of realization of "Land to the Tiller." After each village individually studied the specific emancipation situation of its masses, it was discovered that, with the exception of a small number of villages that had already been emancipated, the majority of villages had not yet been "leveled and replenished." An activist from Balizhuang said: "The stone slab on our bodies is gone, but there are still stones pressing on our arms." A person from Huaizhuang said: "Some people don't even have a sliver of land." Most villages said: "We've only turned over halfway, not completely." After further studying the reasons, a person from Xuezhuang said: "The fruits of struggle have not been distributed to this day." A person from Yaozhuang said: "Some fruits have been put into cooperatives, but the cooperatives are still under the control of feudal forces, a messy account." An activist from Caozhuang said: "A few cadres are shielding local bullies, getting drunk together, and bullies have also become cadres. I haven't been emancipated, but fallen into a pit." After studying the overall situation, they all mustered great enthusiasm to go down and thoroughly promote the in-depth development of the emancipation movement, and comprehensively realize "leveling and replenishing."

　　沙河五六区检查翻身
    决定深入填平补齐
    【本报讯】沙河为了使全县二类村和三类村群运迅速深入与平衡，五、六区在十月二十七、二十八、二十九，召开了褡裢镇等二十五个二类村和三类村（不彻底或落后村庄）的一百七十余积极分子会议，检查“耕者有其田”实现程度。各以自己村群众的具体翻身情况一一研究后，发现除少数村已经翻身外，大多数村仍未“填平补齐”。八里庄的积极分子说：“咱身上的石板没有了，胳膊上还压着石头。”淮庄说：“有个别群众连一分地都没有。”大多数村都说：“翻了半个身，还没有翻透身。”进一步研究原因，薛庄说：“斗争果实至今没分。”姚庄说：“有些果实入了合作社，而合作社还在封建势力掌握之下，乱账一笔。”曹庄积极分子说：“少数干部包庇恶霸，在一块喝醉酒，恶霸也当了干部。我没翻身，倒翻坑里去了。”将全盘情况研究后，他们都鼓起很大劲，要下去彻底推动翻身运动的深入发展。全面实现“填平补齐”。（高而公）
