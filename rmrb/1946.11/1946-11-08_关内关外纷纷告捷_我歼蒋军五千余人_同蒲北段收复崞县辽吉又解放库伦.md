　　Victories Reported Inside and Outside the Pass
    Our Army Annihilates More Than 5,000 Chiang Troops
    Recovers Guoxian in the Northern Section of the Datong-Puzhou Railway; Liaoji Liberates Kulun Again
    In recent days, successive reports of victories have come from our army inside and outside the pass, which are recorded below:
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 5th] The Eighth Route Army in northern Shanxi has successively recovered Guoxian, Sanjiao, and Yuanping Town, annihilating all of the more than 1,500 Yan troops. After the Yan troops in Xin County successively invaded Dingxiang, Yuanping, Guoxian, and Wutai in the latter half of last month, the Eighth Route Army guerrillas advanced to the rear of the Yan troops, and on the 22nd of last month, recovered Sanjiao Town, 50 li west of Xin County, surrounding three regiments of Yan troops from Yuanping and Guoxian. The Yan troops in Guoxian abandoned the city and fled south on the evening of the 31st of last month. The Eighth Route Army took advantage of the victory to pursue and, on the night of the 1st of this month, recovered Yuanping Town, completely eliminating more than 1,500 troops stationed in the town, including the 3rd Regiment of the 39th Division and the 16th Security Regiment of the Yan troops. The results of the battle are still being verified. After the Eighth Route Army recovered Guoxian and Yuanping, the retreat routes of the Yan troops in Wutai and Dingxiang are likely to be cut off at any time.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 5th] The Jiaodong Eighth Route Army annihilated more than 1,000 Chiang troops of the American-equipped 8th Army that invaded Pingdu. Starting on the 30th of last month, parts of the Chiang 8th Army and the 54th Army advanced towards Pingdu from Changyi and Jiaoxian. The 8th Division of the 54th Army was intercepted by the Eighth Route Army in Beihe Temple, about 30 li south of Pingdu, and made no progress. The main force, the 366th Division and the Honor 1st Division of the 8th Army, suffered devastating blows from the Eighth Route Army in the western suburbs of Pingdu, suffering more than 1,000 casualties and capturing more than 100 large carts loaded with supplies and one truck loaded with ammunition. Detailed battle results are still being verified. After completing the aim of annihilating the enemy's active forces, the Eighth Route Army took the initiative to move to the suburbs on the dawn of the 3rd to continue effective strikes.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 2nd] (Delayed) A certain unit of the Democratic Allied Army of the Liaoji Military Region, when the Chiang troops of the 87th Division attacked Tongliao and Kailu, turned to activity in the Chiang-occupied areas. On the 24th of last month, the unit recovered Kulun County, southwest of Tongliao, in one fell swoop, and the Chiang troops there fled north. On the 27th, a surprise attack on Halatao Street, west of Zhangwu, completely annihilated the entire 2nd Battalion and police detachment of the 18th Regiment of the 6th Division of the Chiang-puppet New 27th Army (previously mistaken for the 171st Army), totaling more than 450 people. Its 1st Battalion, which reinforced from Xinlitun, was also partially eliminated. It is designed to capture Chiang-puppet officers and soldiers two hundred and fifty, killing its battalion commander and the following one hundred and fifty, wounding one hundred and fifty. Captured thirteen light machine guns, one heavy machine gun, one hundred and sixty-five rifles, twenty-seven pistols, and twelve small cannons.
