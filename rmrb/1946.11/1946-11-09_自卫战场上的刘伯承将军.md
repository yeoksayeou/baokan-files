　　General Liu Bocheng on the Battlefield of Self-Defense
　　Hei Sheng, Yin Qun
　　On the evening of September 8th, accompanied by the post-victory night rain, a car with two bright eyes drove to a command post on the Heze front line—this was Commander Liu Bocheng's car. Who wouldn't admire this leader who devoted his life to peace and democracy and worked tirelessly for the people's cause? We braved the rain and were very happy to see him, which quickly reminded us that he led the people's army in the Shangdang Campaign, annihilating 40,000 invading Yan puppet troops, and in the Pinghan Line, annihilating 70,000 to 80,000 invading Chiang troops, leading to General Gao Shuxun's uprising, which led to the first comprehensive ceasefire and peace negotiations. Now, he is leading the patriotic self-defense campaign here to defend peace. Just today—September 6th, the Chiang Kai-shek's Third Division, which invaded our central area, was completely wiped out again.
　　He sat on a short stool, and the bright light shone on him. You could see his short beard on his dark and resolute face. Obviously, he was over fifty years old. Shouldn't he be proud? But he told us: "This victory should be attributed to our people. Usually, the side with better weapons should win, but historically and today, there have been many contrary things. This is the power of the people. Only by mobilizing the people can we win victories." He also said: "During the War of Resistance Against Japan, we only had 30,000 to 40,000 people, and the area was only a few counties in northern Shaanxi. Now we have 130 million people and have almost liberated the entire North China and Northeast. At that time, who knew about rocket launchers and American-style mountain guns? Now we have them too." He also used world history to prove: "Because the German, Italian, and Japanese fascists opposed the people, they failed. Their failure is the people's victory." He said that the purpose of our self-defense war "is for peace." His fingers tapped the table, making a "dong, dong" sound. "Who doesn't want peace?" He said painfully: "During the Great Revolution, Chiang Kai-shek first attacked us in Hankou. In eastern Henan, he attacked us from March. If he attacks, shouldn't we fight back? If we don't fight back when attacked, aren't we slaves and sheep, or are we people? Why do we defend ourselves? Isn't it because we don't want to be slaves?" He continued: "We are not afraid of anything, we are only afraid of making mistakes. We must be humble, not discouraged, and not arrogant. The conditions for victory are there. Chiang Kai-shek wants to concentrate on attacking us, so we will destroy his railways, making his military supplies insufficient. This time, he is eating rice transported from Sichuan. If we destroy the railways, we will trap them to death at the intersections. They dare not concentrate their forces, they have to disperse them. If they disperse, we will concentrate our forces to deal with them. Chiang Kai-shek will not give up his anti-people rule, so he is bound to collapse!"
　　Speaking of this, Commander Liu pointed out the importance of our guerrilla warfare, saying: "In the border areas, the county magistrate should be the captain of the guerrilla隊. We must fight and produce, and production must be combined with combat." He finally pointed out: "We must be seriously vigilant because Chiang Kai-shek is transporting troops here from Wuhan again. Our task is still ahead. We must cheer up and shatter the reactionaries' offensive again."
　　As he finished speaking, he left his seat and picked up his hat, because his attendant came in and asked him to leave. He shook hands with many comrades one by one. I thought, "Will he shake hands with me?" I decided to hold my shoes in my left hand. Sure enough, he—Commander Liu—shook my hand. My heart was pounding: "I shook hands with the commander!" How happy I was! "I hope comrades will work hard for Mao Zedong's cause!" This was his last word of farewell to us.

　　自卫战场上的刘伯承将军
    黑生　尹群
    九月八日晚上，伴着胜利后的夜雨，一辆汽车瞪着两只明亮的眼睛，开到了荷泽前线某指挥部，——这就是刘伯承司令的汽车。对这位终身为和平民主，为人民事业而艰苦奋斗的领袖，谁不向往呢？我们冒着雨，很高兴的见到了他，使我们很快的想起来，就是他率领着人民的军队，上党战役歼灭进犯阎伪军四万，在平汉线上歼灭进犯蒋军七八万，出现了高树勋将军的起义，才出现了第一次全面停战的和平谈判局面。现在，他正为了保卫和平，领导这里的爱国自卫战役。就在今天——九月六日，进犯我中心区的蒋第三师，又被全部消灭了。
    他坐在子凳上，明亮的灯光照着他，可以看见在他的黑黑的而又坚毅的脸上，留着短须，显然，他是五十多岁的人了。他应该骄傲吧？但是他却告诉我们：“这次胜利要归功于我们的老百姓，照例应该是有武器与武器好的打胜仗，但历史上和今天却有许多相反的事情，这都是老百姓的力量，唯有发动了老百姓，才能够打胜仗。”他又说：“抗战时，咱只有三四万人，地区只有陕北那几县，到现在咱有一万三千万老百姓，几乎解放了整个的华北和东北。当时谁知道火箭炮、美式山炮，现在我们可也都有了。”他还以世界史证明：“正因德意日法西斯反对人民，所以他败了，他败就是人民胜了。”他说我们自卫战的目的“就是要和平”。他的手指敲着桌面登登作响。“到底谁不愿和平？”他痛切的说：“在大革命时，蒋介石就先在汉口打我们，在豫东，从三月间他就进攻咱。他打，咱不还手吗？挨打不还手，不是奴隶、绵羊，还是人？咱为啥自卫？难道不是不愿当奴隶吗？”他接着说：“我们啥都不怕，就怕犯错误，要虚心，不气馁，也不骄傲。胜利的条件是有的，蒋介石想集中攻我们，我们就破坏他的铁路，使他的军需品不够用，这次他吃的都是由四川运来的米。把铁路破坏了，就会把他们困死在交叉点上。他们兵力又不敢集中，非分散不可。他分散，我们就集中的搞他。蒋介石不放弃反人民的统治，他是非垮不行的！”
    谈到这里，刘司令指出我们游击战的重要说：“在边沿区，县长就该是游击队队长，要战斗，也要生产，生产要与战斗相结合。”他最后指出：“我们要严重警惕，因为蒋介石又由武汉来这运兵了，我们的任务还在后边。咱要打起精神，再次粉碎反动派的进攻。”
    话说到这里，他就离开座捏起帽子，因为他的随员进来请他走了，他和许多同志一一的握了手，我心想：“是不是和我握手？”我决定把鞋让左手提着，果然他——刘司令员给我握个手。我的心扑扑在跳：“我和司令员握手，”我是如何的高兴啊！“希望同志们为毛泽东事业而努力！”这是他和我们告别的最后的一句话。
