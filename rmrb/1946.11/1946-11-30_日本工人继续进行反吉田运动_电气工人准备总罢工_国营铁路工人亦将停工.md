　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 25th. According to the Associated Press: The "Dispute Committee" of the Japan National Electrical Workers' Union, with 95,000 members, announced on the 23rd that it was preparing to hold a national general strike because negotiations with the government and semi-official controlled companies and managers had broken down. The electrical workers' strike wave began in mid-October, and more than 40,000 workers have already joined the strike. According to Kyodo News, the National Congress of the Japan National Railway Workers' Union unanimously passed a resolution on the 23rd stating that if the Yoshida government fails to meet the workers' demands, a strike will be held. The conference passed another resolution to prepare for joint struggle with the National Federation of Transport Workers' Unions and the National Federation of Elementary School Teachers.
