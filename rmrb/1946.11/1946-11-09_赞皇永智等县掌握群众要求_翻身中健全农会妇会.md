　　Zanhuang, Yongzhi and other counties grasp the demands of the masses:
    Vigorously develop farmers' associations and women's associations during the emancipation movement
    [Report from this newspaper] In the mass emancipation movement in Zanhuang, Yongzhi and other places, the working method of the mass line was grasped. The masses were organized according to their demands during the movement, which further promoted the development of the movement and ensured the realization of "land to the tiller." When Comrades Liu Kuan and Gui Xiuying, who led the masses in Qujiang Village, Zanhuang, in their emancipation, began their work, they investigated that the total number of people in the village participating in the farmers' association, militia, and women's association was 58. In addition, there were 264 farmers and 67 women who met the conditions for joining the organization but had not been recruited. This calculation immediately aroused the village cadres' attention to organizing all the farmers. Throughout the movement, organized members participated in the emancipation groups and developed infinite class feelings with non-members. As a result, everyone further demanded to be organized. After discussing why to organize farmers' associations and militias, and who could participate, 193 of the 302 farmers in the village joined the farmers' association, and 74 joined the militia. Of the 87 women, 57 joined the Women's Salvation Association. In Majiazhuang, Pinging County, after the test of the first struggle, some members of the farmers' association were local bullies and lackeys. Therefore, according to the demands of the masses, the old farmers' association was transformed first. The transformation method was to convene a forum. In the forum, everyone first reflected on their understanding of the farmers' association. Many confused ideas were raised, such as the farmers' association was "doing things for the public" and "joining the farmers' association was for receiving relief grain"... In response to these ideas, a discussion was launched, and everyone clarified that "the farmers' association is the emancipation association." Based on these ideological understandings, individual bad elements who refused to correct their mistakes were expelled from the association. After everyone clarified the tasks of the farmers' association, they continued to lead the emancipation. In the movement, the masses' thinking about the farmers' association became clearer. "The farmers' association is the pillar of emancipation," "The more farmers who join the farmers' association, the better." Under such an understanding, a large number of farmers poured into the farmers' association organization. After awakening, the honest farmer Zhang Guitian was elected as the person in charge of the farmers' association. The farmers' association truly became an organization of conscious farmers, which greatly promoted the development of the movement. In the mass movement in En County, the 3rd District of Yongzhi County, and the 6th District, because the leadership paid attention to the strength of women, the members of the farmers' associations in most villages mobilized the women in their families to participate in the struggle. In the struggle, they not only spoke as actively as men and elected leaders to participate in the struggle, but also automatically connected and established women's organizations. In Hulizhuang, Yongzhi County, 620 people were developed in five days. In their own organizations, women used mediation to solve some problems of mother-in-law and daughter-in-law relationships according to the requirements of the members, and the members were all satisfied.

　　赞皇永智等县掌握群众要求
    翻身中健全农会妇会
    【本报讯】赞皇永智等地群众翻身运动中，掌握了群众路线的工作方法，在运动中依据群众要求组织群众，更加推动了运动的发展，保证了耕者有其田的实现。领导赞皇曲江村群众翻身的刘宽、桂秀英同志开始工作时，就调查出本村参加农会民兵妇女会的人数共五十八人，另尚有二百六十四个农民、六十七个妇女有参加组织的条件而没吸收。这一计算，马上就引起了村干部的对组织全体农民的注意。在整个运动中有组织的会员分头参加到翻身小组中、与非会员发生了无限的阶级感情，于是大家进一步要求组织起来。经过讨论为什么组织农会、民兵，什么人能参加等问题后，全村三百零二个农民中，即有一百九十三人参加农会，七十四人参加民兵。八十七个妇女中五十七人参加了妇救会。平定马家庄，经过第一次斗争的考验，农会会员有些是恶霸狗腿，随即依据群众要求，首先改造旧农会。改造办法是召集座谈会，座谈会中先反省对农会的认识，大家提出的糊涂思想极多，如农会是“给公家办事的”，“入农会是为吃救济粮”……针对这些思想展开讨论，大家才明确了“农会就是翻身会”。依据这些思想认识将个别死不改错的坏分子开除出会。大家都明确了农会的任务，便又继续领导翻身。在运动中，群众对农会的思想更加明确了。“农会是翻身柱子”，“农民参加农会。人多力大越好干”……大批农民在这样的认识下，源源不断的涌入农会组织，老实农民张贵田觉悟后，被选为农会负责人。农会真正成为有觉悟农民自己的组织，便大大推动了运动的发展。永智三区恩县六区群运中由于领导上注意了妇女的力量，大部村庄的农会会员便纷纷动员自己家的妇女参加斗争，在斗争中他们不仅与男子同样的积极发言，选出了参加斗争的领袖，而且自动串连，建立妇女组织。永智胡里庄五天内发展六百二十人。妇女在自己的组织中根据会员的要求，用调解的方式，解决了一些婆媳关系问题，会员群众人人满意。
