　　Coordinated Use of Explosions, Sniper Fire, and Raids:
    Yang Juhe's Militia Guerrilla Force Repels Chiang Kai-shek's Troops' Attempt to Build Bunkers and Loot;
    Comrade Yang Bravely Pursues the Enemy and is Gloriously Wounded
    [Our JiaoZuo News] Yang Juhe's militia guerrilla force, which had previously won seven victories out of seven battles in the suburbs of JiaoZuo City, has achieved further victories. On October 26th, Yang Juhe led the militia deep into the enemy-occupied strongholds of Lifeng and Shangbaizuo, laying landmines along the roads. Within two days, four mines exploded, destroying one enemy vehicle. On the morning of October 28th, Yang led the militia to attack the enemy building blockhouses in Lifeng. Militia member Xu Shantao killed an enemy sentry with a single shot, and all the civilian laborers and enemy supervisors were dispersed. In their panic, the enemy blindly fired countless machine guns and small artillery shells. At 8 a.m. on November 2nd, more than 60 enemies from Lifeng went to Liuzhuang to loot. More than 40 entered the village, and 20 provided cover on the south hill outside the village. Upon hearing this from Xizhangzhuang, Yang immediately led the militia guerrilla force to rush to the north hill of Liuzhuang and engage the enemy in fierce battle. By noon, after four enemies were killed or wounded, they fled in disarray to the south hill. Yang and the others took advantage of the victory to pursue, but the enemy relied on the favorable terrain to fire fiercely at the militia. Yang was seriously wounded in the right leg, bleeding profusely, but he resolutely refused to let the enemy take the weapon in his hand. He used all his strength to smash his rifle into two pieces on a rock. At this extremely critical moment, Yang Juhe's guerrilla team members did not flinch. They rushed forward and rescued Yang Juhe and his rifle from the hail of bullets. Just then, villagers ××, ×× and other militia members also arrived and engaged the enemy in fierce battle again. The battle lasted until 3 p.m., when the enemy collapsed. They finally achieved a complete victory. (Wang Ruzhen, Rui Qun)
