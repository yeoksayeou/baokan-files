(Special Dispatch from Shouyang by Our Newspaper) Shancha Village, a border area of Shouyang, has established a strong armed force under the leadership of Wang Guojin and Wang Yuxiao. By integrating land reform and production to defeat the "puppet regime," and coordinating with regular troops in offensive operations, they have successively crushed fifteen Yan-Pseudo offensives, becoming an insurmountable border fortress. The village is only four li away from the Masuo Station on the Zhengtai Railway, with 123 households, 645 people, and 3,750 mu of land. After the Yan-Pseudo forces replaced the Japanese invaders in Masuo last year, they constantly invaded and plundered. Taking advantage of this, Jiang's secret agent Wang Fenggang and others organized a puppet "maintenance association." Influenced by the land reform movement in various places, the masses in the village eagerly demanded land reform, but were afraid of the Yan-Pseudo invasion and did not dare to struggle. Wang Guojin and Wang Yuxiao stepped forward and proposed to the masses: "Don't be afraid that we are close to the enemy, as long as we have arms, we can carry out land reform." This immediately received unanimous support from the masses, who bought three rifles and established a militia. They then proposed to the masses: "First defeat the special agents and dig out the enemy's eyes and ears, then it will be easier to carry out land reform." They immediately arrested five Jiang's special agents in Zhangjiagou and Yujiaping. Wang Fenggang fled to Shouyang City out of fear of punishment. The masses' enthusiasm for struggle was greatly enhanced, and they resolved to confiscate Wang's property, followed by launching a fierce anti-puppet, grievance-airing, and liquidation struggle against other landlords and despots in the village, recovering a total of 160 mu of land and a portion of grain and property, and defeating the puppet regime.

During the wheat harvest this year, they were determined not to let the enemy seize a single grain. Under the leadership of Guojin and Yuxiao, the villagers formulated a method of combining labor and arms to protect the wheat harvest. The village command unified the leadership, the militia approached the blockhouses to attack the enemy and cover the wheat harvest, and all the labor force in the village was organized, divided into shifts and teams, and used and accounted for work points in a unified manner. Harvesting was carried out from the border to the interior, and harvesting was done at night if it could not be done during the day. In the harvesting process, grades were determined based on each person's labor and skills. As a result, the wheat harvest, which used to take half a month, only took six days this year. During the wheat harvest, the Yan-Pseudo forces came to the village three times in a row to seize wheat, but were repelled by the militia. The last time, the Yan-Pseudo forces gathered fifty or sixty people, five large carts, and civilian laborers to invade and seize grain. At this time, it just so happened that two of the village's three guns had been borrowed. The situation was extremely tense. Guojin led a group with the only gun to fight a "sparrow warfare" to confuse the enemy; Yuxiao led a group with a loudspeaker to shout to the enemy: "Charge! Advance!" and approached the enemy to throw grenades. The enemy, unable to figure out the situation, thought that the regular army had arrived, and fled in panic.

During the autumn harvest, the Shancha militia, in addition to monitoring the enemy and constantly fighting, also helped the villagers with no labor to harvest 28 mu of millet and beans near the blockhouses, and carried back 120 dou of grain. The Shancha autumn harvest and grain storage were all completed within twelve days, without letting the Yan-Pseudo forces seize a single grain. The Shancha militia often cooperated with the regular army in combat, reconnaissance, and sabotage, and received awards from higher authorities.

At the end of July, they accepted a task to cut back 600 jin of enemy wires. The militia self-defense team, composed of more than 40 people, formed two groups for cover and harvesting, and dispatched to the Zhengtai Road for four consecutive times, cutting back a total of 1,500 jin of wires, exceeding the task by half. Every night when they returned to the village, they would approach the blockhouses and throw a grenade at the enemy. When the enemy's machine guns fired, they would quietly retreat.

On August 10th, more than a thousand Yan-Pseudo troops from Yuci pounced on our sabotage team in Masuo. After they discovered this, they immediately led the militia to occupy the mountain, desperately blocking the enemy, and immediately sent intelligence to Masuo. They only moved after all of our 200 sabotage teams had withdrawn. In order to restore the Zhengtai Road that had been destroyed by us, the Yan-Pseudo forces assigned more than 400 people to reside in Xinao, but they were often harassed by the Shancha militia. The Yan-Pseudo forces were extremely annoyed and divided into three groups to encircle and destroy Shancha, but they were eventually defeated by the Shancha militia in coordination with the regular army.

Since then, the Shancha militia has often taken the initiative to attack the enemy. Their slogan is: "Wherever the enemy goes, we will fight there!"

　　寿阳山岔民兵成为边地堡垒
    结合翻身生产打垮阎伪政权
    配合正规军作战粉碎阎伪十五次进攻
    【本报寿阳特讯】寿阳边地山岔村，在该村王国瑾、王玉小领导下建立坚强武装，结合翻身生产打垮“维持”，配合正规军破击作战，先后粉碎阎伪十五次进攻，已成为不可逾越的边地堡垒。该村距正太路马首车站仅四里地，一百二十三户，六百四十五人，三千七百五十亩地。去年阎伪在马首代替日寇后，即不断进犯抢掠，该村蒋特王凤刚等趁机组织维持会维持起来。在各地群众翻身运动影响下，该村群众虽迫切要求翻身，但因怕阎伪进犯不敢斗争；王国瑾、王玉小挺身而出，向群众提出：“不怕咱们离敌人近，只要有武装就能翻身。”当即得到群众一致拥护，买了三支步枪，成立起民兵。他们又向群众提出：“先把特务打垮，挖掉敌人的耳目，才好翻身。”当即在张家沟、宇家坪逮捕了五个蒋特，王凤刚畏罪逃进了寿阳城。群众斗争情绪顿形昂奋，决议没收了王的财产，紧接着就向村里其他地主恶霸展开猛烈的反维持、诉苦清算斗争，共收回土地百六十亩，粮食资财一部，打了维持。
    今年麦收时，他们决心不让敌人抢走一粒粮。全村群众在国瑾和玉小领导下，订出了劳武结合保卫麦收的办法，村指挥部统一领导，民兵接近碉堡打击敌人掩护麦收，全村劳力都组织起来，分班分队统一调整使用及计工算帐。由边地向腹地收割，白日不能收者夜里收，并在收割中根据各人劳力技术评等定分。因之往年半个月的麦收，今年却只花了六天。麦收中阎伪连续三次到该村抢麦，均被民兵击退。最后一次，阎伪集结了五六十人，大车五辆及民夫进犯抢粮，这时刚巧碰到村里三支枪被借走了两支，情况万分紧张，国瑾乃带一个小组拿上那唯一的一支枪去打麻雀阵，迷惑敌人；玉小带一组拿着喇叭筒向敌人呐喊：“冲锋！前进！”并接近敌人投手榴弹，敌人不摸虚实，以为正规军赶到，遂狼狈逃窜。
    秋收时，山岔民兵，除监视敌人与不断作战外，并在碉堡附近给无劳力群众抢收了谷、豆二十八亩，担回谷百二十斗。山岔秋收与藏粮在十二天内即全部完成，没让阎伪抢走一粒粮。山岔民兵经常配合正规军作战、侦查、破击，得到上级奖励。
    七月底他们接受了一个任务，要割回敌人六百斤电线，民兵自卫队四十多人组成掩护、收割两组，向正太路连续出动了四次，共割回电线一千五百斤，超过了任务一倍半。每夜回村时，他们都要接近碉堡向敌人投一个手榴弹，等敌人的机枪响起，他们才悄悄撤退。
    八月十号，榆次阎伪千余人猛扑我正在马首的破击队，他们发觉后立即带领民兵一面占据山头，拚命堵击敌人，一面马上给马首送情报，直至我二百余破击队全部撤退后他们才转移。阎伪为恢复被我破坏了的正太路，分派四百余人驻于西瑙，但是他们却经常遭受到山岔民兵的袭扰。阎伪恼怒已极，分三路人马想包围、摧垮山岔，然而终被山岔民兵配合正规军将其击溃。
    此后，山岔民兵即经常主动打击敌人，他们的口号是：“敌人向那里去，我们就打到那里！”玫饺褐谝恢掠祷ぃ?蛄巳?Р角梗?闪⑵鹈癖?Ｋ?怯窒蛉褐谔?出：“先把特务打垮，挖掉敌人的耳目，才好翻身。”当即在张家沟、宇家坪逮捕了五个蒋特，王凤刚畏罪逃进了寿阳城。群众斗争情绪顿形昂奋，决议没收了王的财产，紧接着就向村里其他地主恶霸展开猛烈的反维持、诉苦清算斗争，共收回土地百六十亩，粮食资财一部，打了维持。
