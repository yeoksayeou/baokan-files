　　Donate Money and Goods to Support the Front Lines
    [Our Newspaper] To defeat the traitorous and country-selling Chiang Kai-shek and win the victory of the patriotic self-defense war, the people and organizations in our border region responded to the call of "everything for the front line" and enthusiastically donated money and goods to support the soldiers at the front.

    In just a few months, this newspaper has received donations from the employees of the First Sub-district, the Second Factory of the Jinnan Bank, the Yongxing Printing Factory, and our colleagues, including: 746,280 Jicha banknotes, as well as towels, shirts, shoes, and other items. All of these donations and goods have been sent to the Political Department of the Military Region and used to purchase a batch of daily necessities for the soldiers at the front. (Xiu Shi)
