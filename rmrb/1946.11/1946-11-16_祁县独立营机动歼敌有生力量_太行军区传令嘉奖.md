    Qixian Independent Battalion Mobilely Annihilates Enemy's Active Forces
    Taihang Military Region Issues Commendation Order
    [This newspaper's Changzhi, 14th dispatch] The Taihang Military Region recently issued an order commending several annihilation battles fought by the Qixian Independent Battalion of the Second Military Sub-district. The order stated: (1) At 8:00 AM on August 17th, a squad of the Qixian Independent Battalion ambushed near Duanjiayao (north of Zihongzhen), killing three enemies guarding a railway pillbox and seizing three rifles. (2) On August 18th, at dawn, the Yan-puppet troops stationed in Qichengcun (five miles southeast of Qixian County) dispatched 45 soldiers to loot grain. Our Qixian Independent Battalion laid an ambush in favorable terrain three miles southeast of Qicheng. When they entered our ambush area, our troops bravely engaged in hand-to-hand combat. The battle lasted less than half an hour, completely annihilating the enemy, with none escaping. A total of 26 enemies were killed, 19 were captured alive, and two light machine guns, one grenade launcher, 18 rifles, and over 2,000 rounds of ammunition were seized. We suffered only light injuries to four soldiers. (3) On the night of September 11th at 12:00 midnight, the Qixian Independent Battalion, in conjunction with the armed work team and a portion of the militia from Gaobeicun (west of Zihongzhen), attacked the Yong'anzhai stronghold (located between Zihongzhen and the Baishiling stronghold). When the enemy sentries detected the attack, we launched a charge, quickly capturing and burning down the two blockhouses in the village. Consequently, the machine gun company of the 1st Regiment of the 9th Column of the Yan army, with the exception of one squad that escaped, was completely annihilated. A total of over 30 enemies were killed, 27 were captured alive, and two 82mm mortars, one light machine gun, 11 rifles, over 2,000 rounds of ammunition, 50 mortar shells, and six pack mules were seized. We suffered 11 casualties among our commanders and fighters. The above-mentioned battles of the battalion all achieved complete victory at a small cost. The main reason for this was that the commanders constantly paid attention to grasping and studying the enemy's activity patterns and defensive characteristics, and actively adopted mobile tactics on how to eliminate the enemy. This is worth learning by all troops (especially those fighting persistently in a specific area). We hope that this fighting style of mobilely annihilating the enemy's active forces will be widely promoted among all local armed forces in the entire region.

    祁县独立营机动歼敌有生力量
    太行军区传令嘉奖
    【本报长治十四日电】太行军区于日前颁发命令，表扬二分区祁县独立营几个歼灭战斗，该命令称：（一）八月十七日上午八时，祁县独立营一个班埋伏于段家窑（子洪镇北）附近，将守备铁路碉堡之敌三名击毙，缴获步枪三枝。（二）驻祁城村（祁县城东南五里）阎伪，于八月十八日拂晓以四十五人之兵力出动抢粮，我祁县独立营设伏于祁城东南三里有利地形，当其进入我埋伏地区，我军即奋勇投入白刃战斗，战斗不到半小时，即将敌全部歼灭，无一逃脱，计毙敌二十六名，生俘十九名，缴获轻机枪二挺，掷弹筒一个，步枪十八枝，子弹两千余发，我仅轻伤战士四名。（三）九月十一日夜十二时祁县独立营结合武工队及郜北村（子洪镇西）民兵一部，袭击永安寨据点（在子洪镇与白狮岭据点之间），当敌警戒发觉时，我则投入冲锋，很快即将该村两个炮楼占领焚毁，于是阎军九纵队第一团机炮连二个排除跑掉一个班外，全为我歼灭，计毙敌三十余名，生俘二十七名，缴获八二迫击炮两门，轻机枪一挺，步枪十一枝，子弹两千余发，迫击炮弹五十发，驮骡六匹，我伤亡指战员十一名。上述该营几个战斗，都是以小的代价取得完满的胜利，主要是指挥员经常注意掌握与研究了敌人活动规律与守备特点，并积极采取如何能消灭敌人的机动战术，是值得各部队（特别是固定在某一地区内坚持斗争的部队）学习的。我们希望这种机动歼灭敌人有生力量的战斗作风，在全区各地方武装中广大的发扬起来。
