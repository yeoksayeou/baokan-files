　　Hegu County Government Officially Announces
    Strict Prohibition of Landlords' Illegal Reversal of Settlements
    [This newspaper's Yangcheng dispatch of the 19th] In order to safeguard the people's sacred fruits of liberation, our democratic county government of Hegu has recently issued an official announcement: All property (including land, houses, clothing, grain, livestock, etc.) obtained by the people through rent reduction, debt clearing, and anti-traitor/anti-hegemon struggles before August 1946 is the people's legal and sacred property. No one may illegally reverse the settlements or unreasonably seize it again. If the fruits of the people's liberation have already been illegally reversed after the invasion of the Chiang Kai-shek troops, they should be quickly and voluntarily returned, and the government will not hold past actions against them. However, those who remain stubbornly unenlightened and continue to illegally reverse the settlements will be resolutely punished according to the law.

　　垣曲县府明令公布
    严禁地主非法倒算
    【本报阳城十九日电】垣曲为保卫人民神圣翻身果实，我民主县政府顷明文公布：凡在民国三十五年八月以前人民清租清债反奸反霸所得之一切财产（包括土地、房屋、衣服、粮食、牲畜等）均为人民合法之神圣财产。任何人不得再行非法倒算无理侵夺。如在蒋军侵陷后，业已非法倒算之人民翻身果实，应即迅速自动退回，政府不咎既往。但仍执迷不悟，继续非法倒算，必将依法坚决惩处。
