　　Mastering Policy to Complete Land Leveling and Equalization
    Luo Jia Village Refuses to Accept Land Offered by Middle Peasants
    [This newspaper's Ji-Lu-Yu dispatch of the 30th] During the large-scale land reform movement in Qingfeng County, the masses of Luo Jia Village launched a liquidation struggle against the big landlord Luo Xixian, reclaiming much land that had been plundered. As a result, many middle peasants had illusions and offered their land to the farmers' association. After group discussions by all members, it was decided that the land of the middle peasants was earned through hard work and sweat, so they decided to refuse to accept it. For example, Luo Wanxiang, a wealthy middle peasant, had 130 mu of land, but his family had a total of 22 people and five laborers, and his family did not exploit others, so the farmers' association did not want his land. Good explanations were given to other middle peasants as well, and the poor and lower-middle peasants were closely united. After this investigation and reduction, each military family member in the village was allocated 3.2 mu of land, and each poor peasant was allocated 2.2 mu of land. Extreme poverty was eliminated in the whole village, and the goal of "land to the tiller" was achieved.

　　掌握政策完成填平补齐
    骆家村拒受中农献田
    【本报冀鲁豫三十日电】在此次清丰县大规模的土地改革运动中，骆家村群众向大地主骆锡贤展开清算斗争，索还了被掠去之许多土地，不少中农因此发生错觉，纷纷向农会自动献田。经全体会员分组讨论，认为中农土地都是血汗换来，故决定拒绝不收。如富裕中农骆万祥，有地一百三十亩，但全家共二十二口人，五个劳动力，他家又没有剥削别人，所以农会就没有要他的地。对其他中农，也都作了很好解释，中贫农亲密团结。经过这次查减该村军属每人补到三亩二分地，贫农每人补到二亩二分地，全村消灭了赤贫，实现了耕者有其田。
