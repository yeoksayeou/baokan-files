　　The Sons of the French People
    Maurice Thorez
    The General Secretary of the French Communist Party, tall, broad-shouldered, his hair often tousled, his smile gentle. When he speaks to the masses, he immediately becomes a ball of fire, his eyes shining. Thorez likes to call himself "the son of the French people." He was born in Calais in 1900, into a family of miners. He only finished primary school before going to work in the mines. But he later became a very erudite person, with profound research not only in Marxism, economics, and sociology, but also with great achievements in general academic culture, admired and respected by French intellectuals. Thorez was a socialist very early on and one of the founders of the French Communist Party. In March 1919, he joined the Socialist Party and the trade union, and was a member of the committee advocating joining the Third International, fighting to withdraw from the Second International and join the Third International. He participated in the parliamentary split movement, laying the foundation for the French Communist Party. In 1924, he was elected as a member of the Central Committee by the National Congress of the French Communist Party, and in October of the same year, he served as the secretary of the Northern France Bureau. During the formation of the French Popular Front in 1936, he was one of the main leaders. During the Second World War, after Germany invaded France, he led the French people in organizing underground armies and engaging in guerrilla warfare, inflicting great blows on the German invaders and achieving brilliant success. Thorez's life is plain and simple. The French have three major luxuries: wine, food, and coconuts, but he has nothing to do with any of them.
    Jacques Duclos
    The Secretary of the French Communist Party, the second most important figure in the French Communist Party, known as the "brain" of the party. He is the French Communist Party's representative in parliament and the Vice-President of the French Constituent Assembly. Duclos was born in the Pyrenees in 1896. As a child, he was a baker. During the First World War, he fought on the front lines for three years. He was influenced by the famous French writer Barbusse and joined the Communist Party in 1910. In 1935, he was elected as an executive member of the Communist International. During the French occupation, he remained hidden in Paris, persisting in his work. Duclos often appears before the masses. Every grand political gathering is never without him. Last year, Duclos wrote the famous article criticizing Browder's policies, and his name spread throughout the world.
    André Marty
    The Secretary of the French Communist Party, an old fighter of the Communist International, and the organizer of the famous Spanish "International Brigades." During the First World War, Marty was a naval engineering officer. Later, his warship was sent to the Black Sea to interfere with the Russian October Revolution. Marty organized the famous mutiny of the French Navy in the Black Sea. Marty has traveled to many places, and workers on the European continent are very familiar with him, considering him the standard-bearer of the West European Communist parties.

　　法国人民的儿子
    多列士
    法国共产党的总书记，高个子，阔肩膊，头发常常是蓬松的，他的笑是温和的。当他向群众演说时，他马上成为一团烈火，眼睛也发亮了。多列士爱称自己为“法国人民的儿子”，他于一九○○年生于加莱，世业矿工，他只念完小学就到矿场工作去了。但他后来却成为非常博学的人，不仅在马克思主义、经济学和社会学方面有深刻研究，即在一般学术文化方面也有很大成就，为法国知识份子所景仰与尊崇。多列士很早就是社会主义者，是法共的创始人之一。他在一九一九年三月加入社会党和工会，是主张加入第三国际委员会的一员，为退出第二国际加入第三国际而斗争。参加国会分裂运动，奠定了法共的基础。一九二四年被法共全国代表大会选为中央委员，同年十月任法北局的书记。在一九三六年法国人民阵线组成时，是主要领导人之一，在第二次世界大战中，德国侵占法国后，领导法国人民组织地下军与从事游击战争，予德寇极大打击，获得光辉成就。多列士生活清淡简朴，法国人有三大奢侈：酒、食品、和椰子与他一概无缘。
    杜克洛
    法国共产党的书记，法共的第二位人物，有党的脑之称，他是法共在议会中的人，是法国立宪议会副议长，杜克洛于一八九六年生于比利牛斯山，幼时是一个面包师，第一次大战时他在前线作战三年，他被著名的法国作家巴比塞所影响，于一九一○年加入共产党，一九三五年被选为共产国际的执委。法国沦陷期间，他一直潜藏在巴黎坚持工作。杜克洛常常出现在群众之前，每一次盛大的政治集会，总少不了他。去年杜克洛写了著名的批判白劳德政策的文章，他的名字遂传遍全世界。
