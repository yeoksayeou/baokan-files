　　Brief Replies

　　Question: The sixth issue of the "Half-Monthly Digest" published in Jin-Sui carried a news item: over three thousand children aged three to twelve in Tianjin were kidnapped by "flower snatchers" who removed their internal organs and eyes for Americans to manufacture poison gas and medicines. What are "flower snatchers"? We express our infinite indignation at the cruelty of American imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek's utter lack of conscience. – Submitted by the Children's Magazine.

　　Answer: As long as imperialist troops are stationed in China and become the "Emperor Emeritus" of the Chinese government in politics and economy, they will do anything evil; and all heinous crimes will inevitably seek their protection. "Flower snatching" involves using a special anesthetic drug to make women and children lose consciousness after inhaling it, in order to achieve the purpose of rape and murder. This spring, a Kuomintang-protected pro-Japanese traitor cinema in Beiping used this method to rape many young women, causing a sensation. The facts of the kidnapping of children in Tianjin have not yet been fully investigated, as for internal organs and eyes, they cannot be made into poison gas, but they can be preserved for transplantation into wounded soldiers and for experiments. Beasts who run people over with jeeps and laugh wildly are very likely to do such evil and poisonous things.

　　Question: Your newspaper's first page on the ninth of this month carried a news item with the title "Guizhou Salt Famine, People Have Nothing to Eat." However, the content is unrelated to the title, which is puzzling. Please explain. – A reader asks.

　　Answer: We are very grateful for your enthusiasm in caring about improving the newspaper. The original title of that news item was "Obeying the Orders of the American Masters, Chiang Kai-shek Sells Salt to Japan, Guizhou Salt Famine, People Have Nothing to Eat," which was composed of two news items. When a large manuscript squeezed out a news item, the title was changed. But we forgot to proofread carefully, resulting in a mismatch between the title and the text. This is our negligence. In addition to conducting in-depth self-examination and striving for improvement, we also hope that you will continue to provide opinions and work together to run the newspaper well.

　　简复
    问：晋绥出版的半月文摘第六期载一消息：天津市三至十二岁的孩子，为拍花人拍去三千余名，取其内脏眼睛，以供美国人制造毒瓦斯和药品之用。请问“拍花人”是什么？我们对美帝国主义的残忍和蒋介石的丧尽天良，表示无限愤恨。——儿童杂志社提出。
    答：只要帝国主义的军队驻在中国，而在政治上，经济上成为中国政府的太上皇，就什么恶毒侵害的事情都会做得出来；而一切罪大恶极的事情，也必然会寻求他们作掩护。拍花是利用一种特制的麻醉药品，使妇女小孩嗅到后丧失知觉，以达到奸淫杀害的目的。今年春天北平一国民党护庇的汉奸电影院，就曾用此法奸淫青年妇女多人，哄动一时。天津儿童被拍的事实，现尚未能查明其详情如何，至于五脏眼睛之类并不能制成毒瓦斯，但可以保存起来作移植于伤兵体中及实验之用。用吉普辗人而又纵声狂笑的野兽们，是很可能干到这样坏而且毒的。
    问：贵报本月九日一版载消息一则，标题为“贵州盐荒，人民无食”，查其内容，则与题无关，令人难解，请予说明为幸。——一读者问。
    答：对于你关心改进报纸的热忱，我们非常的感谢。那个消息的原标题是《服从美主子命令，蒋介石卖盐与日本，贵州盐荒人民无食》，由两则新闻合组而成。当大稿挤抽下一则新闻，换了题目。但忘记仔细校对，以致题文不符。这是我们工作的疏忽。我们除深入检讨力求改进外，尚祈不时提出意见，共同努力把报办好。
