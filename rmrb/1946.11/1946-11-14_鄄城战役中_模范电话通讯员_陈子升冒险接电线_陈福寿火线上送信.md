    Juye Campaign
    Model Telephone Operator
    Chen Zisheng Risks Life to Connect Wires
    Chen Fushou Delivers Messages on the Front Line
    [Our newspaper, Jiluyu Front, 12th dispatch] During the Juye annihilation battle, frontline telephone operators and messengers ensured the swift transmission of commanders' orders amidst intense artillery fire, making significant contributions to the victory of annihilating 8,500 Chiang troops. Before the battle, telephone operator Chen Zisheng had already set up the telephone line for the First Battalion. Fearing that the line would be cut, he set up a double line. After the battle began, the line was cut several times by artillery shells, and each time he risked artillery fire to reconnect it immediately, testing the line every three minutes and checking the line all night without stopping. The First Battalion ran out of grenades, but because the telephone connection was good, grenades were delivered in time, completing the task of annihilating the enemy. Messenger Chen Fushou went alone through the enemy's most heavily guarded blockade line to contact various battalions. Each time he set off, he carried a basket of grenades on his back, and when he returned, he carried a colored signal. In the Ren Village annihilation battle, he did not stop all night, delivering orders to the front line more than 20 times in a hail of bullets. His new cotton coat was shot with five holes by Chiang troops' bullets, but his working spirit remained the same, without any fear.

    陈福寿火线上送信
    【本报冀鲁豫前线十二日电】鄄城歼灭战中，前线电话员、通讯员在猛烈炮火中保证指挥员的命令迅速传达，对歼灭蒋军八千五百人的胜利贡献极大。电话员陈子升在战斗前就将一营电话线架好，他恐怕电线断了，就架了双线，战斗开始后，电线几次被炮弹打断，每次他都冒着炮火立刻重新接上，每三分钟试线一次，一夜没停脚的检查电线。一营的手榴弹打完了，但因电话联络得好，后面手榴弹得以及时送到完成了歼灭敌人的任务。通讯员陈福寿只身通过敌人火力最密的封锁线，与各营联络，他每次出发时背一筐子手榴弹，回来时就背一个彩号，他在任庄歼灭战中，一夜没停脚，在枪林弹雨中往最前线传递命令二十多次，他的新棉衣上被蒋军的枪弹打了五个窟窿，但他的工作精神却始终如一毫无畏色。
