    Yundong Work Team Summarizes Two Months of Experience
    Resolutely Suppress the Great Traitor-Tyrants
    Boldly Let the Masses Act
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The basic experience of the Yundong Work Team in Jinnan in mobilizing the masses in August and September is: whether the masses dare to take action depends on whether the leadership will boldly let go. Yundong is a border area, and the landlord class, in conjunction with the puppet bandit armed forces, is carrying out a bloody rule. This spring, as soon as the masses raised their heads, 154 mass leaders were killed. Therefore, most of the masses did not dare to move. When they acted, they were all determined to "risk everything." At first, the work team did not fully understand this situation and was afraid of everything, always unable to let go. For example, they were afraid that killing heinous traitors would affect other landlords from running away. They were afraid that the masses would go "left" and that the struggle would be "chaotic." The masses requested to detain people before taking action, but they were not allowed to detain. A puppet bandit in Suliuzhuang, although four small children said he killed their mother, we did not dare to kill him for fear of wrongly accusing someone. In short, the masses were made to feel constrained and dared not act without seeing the cadres. On the contrary, in Youwangzhuang, when the evil landlords were detained, the masses immediately took action. After the evil landlords of Wenxinzhuang and Zhuzhuang ran away, the masses shouted: "Seal the door!" "Struggle even harder." As a result, the landlords automatically returned. In Xiaoguanzhuang, after the head of the traitorous secret service Li Zhendong was killed, the masses, in order to defend the fruits of victory and prevent armed secret service attacks, fought guerrillas in the woods every day. Some small landlords also said that Li Zhendong "went too far in his work." Based on the above facts, we have summarized a piece of experience, that is, to lead the masses to a great turn around, we must first have the spirit of bold emancipation, clarify our attitude, and support the masses - let the masses detain if they want to detain, make decisions for them if they want us to, and issue announcements stating that the masses have the right to confiscate the property of great traitors and the right to demand back the property seized by evil landlords, etc. According to the demands of the masses, take all effective measures, break the feudal shackles, ignite the enthusiasm of the masses, and the masses will not fear anything and will be stirred up.

    运东工作队总结两月经验
    坚决镇压大奸霸
    放手让群众行动
    【本报特讯】冀南运东工作队，总结八、九两个月发动群众的基本经验是：群众敢不敢行动起来要看领导上会不会大胆放手。运东是边沿区，地主阶级结合伪匪武装，进行着血腥的统治。今春群众刚一抬头，群众领袖即被杀百五十四人，因此群众多不敢动，行动时都是下了“豁上了”（拚上命）的决心，起初工作队对这种情况认识不够，怕这怕那，总是放不开手。如怕杀了罪大恶极的汉奸，影响别的地主跑掉。怕群众“左”了，怕斗“乱”了。群众要求扣起来再行动，不让群众扣。苏留庄一个伪匪，虽有四个小孩子说他杀害了他们母亲，但我们不敢杀，怕冤了人。总之弄的群众束手束脚，不见干部不敢行动。相反的在尤王庄扣起了恶霸地主，群众立即行动起来。温辛庄、朱庄恶霸地主跑走后，群众喊着：“封门！”“斗的更厉害。”结果地主自动又回来了。小官庄杀了汉奸特务头子李振东，群众为保卫胜利果实，防止武装特务进攻，天天在树林子里打游击。有些小地主也说李振东“办事太过了”。根据上述事实，总结出一条经验，即要领导群众大翻身，首先要有大胆放手的精神，明确态度，为群众撑腰——群众要扣就扣，要替他们作主就作主，要出布告说明群众有权利没收大汉奸的财产，有权利向恶霸要回霸占的财产等。根据群众要求，采取一切有效办法，打碎封建枷锁，烧起群众热情，群众才会不怕一切，轰动起来。
