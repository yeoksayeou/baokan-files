　　Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 7th. The Zaozhuang miners have formed a workers' detachment, and won their first battle. After Chiang's troops occupied Zaozhuang, a large number of workers poured into the Zaozhuang Mine Police Headquarters. On the 28th of last month, the team held a conference in a certain place and decided to rename itself the Workers' Detachment. At the meeting, the workers unanimously vowed to take forceful action to assist the main force and recover Zaozhuang. That night, they went to the front line and defeated two battalions of Chiang's troops on the east and west mountains of the highway fifteen miles north of Zaozhuang, capturing twelve Chiang's soldiers alive. Furthermore, the Pixian militia, as of the end of last month, had fought a total of eighteen battles, killing or capturing more than eighty Chiang's soldiers, seizing five long and short guns, recovering more than twenty villages and towns, and retrieving more than 100,000 catties of grain that had been plundered. The militia in the third district of Yanzhou have fought thirty-one battles in besieging and harassing the traitor Wu Huawen, killing, capturing, and wounding thirty-seven people including company commanders, seizing seventeen long and short guns, more than seven hundred rounds of ammunition, and recovering sixteen large carts of grain.
