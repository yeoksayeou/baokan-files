    Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Government wanted to make uniforms for its staff and specified that American-made Mourdant cloth be used. Tian Heqing, Director-General of the Shanghai Branch of the National Federation of Labor Unions, said: "This is outrageous! We once asked the mayor to issue an order to promote domestic goods.

    The cost of having a baby in Shanghai is astonishing.

The medium price is five or six hundred thousand yuan, and the bare minimum is two or three hundred thousand yuan. As for the mother's rest before and after childbirth, that is not included.
