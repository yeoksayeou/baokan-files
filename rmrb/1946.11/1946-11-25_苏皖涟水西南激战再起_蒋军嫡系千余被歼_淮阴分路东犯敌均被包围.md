　　Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 22nd: In the northern Jiangsu-Anhui front, the New Fourth Army annihilated over a thousand of Chiang Kai-shek's elite troops, known for their stubbornness, and shot down one American-made Chiang aircraft. The elite Chiang troops of the 7th Army, 171st Division, and one regiment each of the 172nd Division, who had occupied Huaiyin, launched an offensive towards the northeast from Huaiyin and other places on the morning of the 17th, the sixth day after Chiang Kai-shek announced the so-called "ceasefire order," under the cover of four fighter planes. After three days of fierce fighting, the New Fourth Army killed and wounded over a thousand Chiang soldiers, shot down a Chiang aircraft on the 19th, and surrounded the Chiang troops who had invaded Dingjiatangfang, fifty miles northwest of Huaiyin, on three sides, and is now in the process of annihilating them. The Chiang troops of the 74th Division stationed in Huai'an attempted to relieve the siege of Dingjiatangfang, and on the 19th, with the remnants of their 51st Brigade and one regiment of the 28th Brigade, launched an offensive eastward in two routes towards Shunheji, more than 20 miles south of Lianshui, and were also surrounded by the Eighth Route Army.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 17th: Heroes of self-defense are emerging in Jiangsu and Anhui. In the Battle of Lianshui, Mei Guancai, a soldier of the 3rd Company of a certain unit of the New Fourth Army, bravely charged into the enemy's formation and captured three Thompson submachine guns. Wei Ting, a sharpshooter of a detachment, hit five Chiang soldiers with seven shots within a range of 500 meters. Many new recruits showed the same determination and courage. Wang A, a new recruit from Jianyang, threw back an unexploded grenade thrown by the enemy at a distance of 40 meters, killing four enemies. Huang Xiucai and Guan Wucai, new recruits from Yancheng, fought for more than ten days. Initially, the instructor asked him to stay in the rear, but he cried and said, "I joined the army to protect the land and fight against the reactionaries. I must go to the front line and compete with my brother!" Later, the instructor agreed, and he smiled and rushed to the front line. Ji Guizhi, the militia squad leader of Sixian County, guarded the north bank of the Liutang River and hit three Chiang soldiers with three shots.
