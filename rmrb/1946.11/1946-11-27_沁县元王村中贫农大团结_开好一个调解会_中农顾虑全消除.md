　　Great Solidarity of Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants in Yuanwang Village, Qin County
    Holding a Successful Mediation Meeting
    Eliminates All Worries of Middle Peasants
    [This Newspaper Reports] In Yuanwang Village, Qin County, the method of mediation was used to resolve the entanglement between Wei Huanglai (a middle peasant) and the masses, and middle peasants actively participated in the struggle. Yuanwang Village is an area bordering the enemy. Before this major movement, a struggle had already been carried out, but the masses did not achieve emancipation. When the work team arrived this time, the masses said, "A superficial accounting like water over the earth's surface is not as good as doing corvée labor." At the same time, the masses had concerns, especially the middle peasants had the most concerns. For example, some middle peasants had saved some money and lent it out at interest, fearing it would be counted against them; some did not understand rent reduction and debt liquidation, and were confused and afraid; some were afraid of being struggled against because their families had guns (referring to puppet soldiers). Therefore, they often avoided trouble, feared trouble, and remained dutiful, not daring to participate in the struggle. Sometimes, when the village held meetings, they were perfunctory, and they did not bring up many of their hardships.
    The work team paid attention to this characteristic and took care to absorb middle peasants in the anti-traitor and anti-despot struggle. However, after the downfall of the local bully Chang Jincai, sixty to seventy people from Duan Village and Shangwan Village near Yuanwang came to settle accounts with Wei Huanglai. Wei Huanglai was originally a middle peasant, but because his son, Wei Zaicheng, was captured by the stubborn army and drafted into the puppet army, and the stubborn army went to various villages to rob grain, and everyone in the villages saw him following the stubborn army several times, this time they all came to him to complain. Huanglai and his son had never exploited anyone in the past. Not only was his whole family afraid, but the entire Yuanwang Village was also in an uproar. If they were to settle accounts, Wei Huanglai's entire property would not be enough. The basic masses were also dissatisfied but dared not say anything. This created an opportunity for the landlords to exploit, and they spread rumors widely among the middle peasants: "You didn't believe us when we said they would cut the leeks, but now it's your turn." The village seemed very chaotic. After learning about this situation, the work team explained to the masses from various villages: "Huanglai's son did not go voluntarily, and it was also out of necessity that he came out to rob things." After more than a day of discussion, everyone finally realized that Wei Huanglai was one of us, and also realized that his son was captured by the enemy and was forced to become a puppet soldier. The leadership then guided everyone to completely place their hatred on the enemy. The masses' attitude towards Wei Huanglai changed to one of sympathy and cordial friendship. Not only was there no struggle or accounting, but on the contrary, they offered comfort. Everyone expressed their feelings together, and Huanglai was relieved. His whole family was moved to tears. Huanglai also said to everyone: "I really have nowhere to诉苦. My child became a puppet soldier, and I still couldn't escape the enemy's robbery. Last December, they robbed me three times. No one in my family is in the Eighth Route Army, but everyone treats me so well, which is the same as the Eighth Route Army treating me well." He said excitedly, "I will never forget the Eighth Route Army even when I die, I will definitely follow them." Because this struggle was handled properly, it received sympathy and praise from Yuanwang and nearby villages, and the public opinion of the masses also changed. It also gave a powerful answer to the landlords' rumors and slanders. Even the local bullies had to say: "The Eighth Route Army can recognize good and bad people." After this problem was resolved, more than thirty middle peasant households and some small puppet families were also involved in the struggle. From then on, when there were problems between the middle peasants, they adopted the method of expressing their feelings to mediate. The poor and lower-middle peasants were of one mind against the landlords, and the liquidation movement will have new progress.

　　沁县元王村中贫农大团结
    开好一个调解会
    中农顾虑全消除
    【本报讯】沁县元王村用调解办法解决卫黄来（中农）与群众的纠葛问题，中农纷纷参加斗争。元王村是接敌区，在这次大运动前，就进行过一次斗争，但群众没有翻身，这次工作队下去群众说：“像过去水过地皮式的算账，还不如打忙工。”同时群众有顾虑，特别中农的顾虑最多，如有的中农积储下几个钱放过账，怕算他；有的对减租清债不了解，糊涂怕；有的因自己家有枪的（指伪军）也怕斗，所以经常躲事怕事守本分，不敢参加斗争，有时村里召开一些会议，也是应付，他们有许多苦事，也不往出提。
    工作队注意了这个特点，在反奸霸斗争中注意吸收中农，但在斗倒拳头利（老一分）常金才后，元王附近的段村、上湾群众，来了六七十人，要来算卫黄来。卫黄来本是个中农，因为他儿卫在成被顽军抓去编了伪军，顽军到各村抢粮，跟着顽军出发过几次，各村人都见了，所以这次都找他来诉苦。黄来和他儿子平素没有剥削过人，不但他全家害怕，连整个元王村都纷纷议论起来，假若要算了的话，卫黄来的全部家当也不够。基本群众也不满意，但不敢啃气，这样便造下地主钻空子的机会，在中农中大肆宣传：“过去说割韭菜你们不信，现在可轮到头上了。”显得村里很乱。工作队了解到这个情况后，便向各村所来的群众进行解释：“黄来他儿子不是自动去的，出来抢东西也是迫不得已的。”经一天多的讨论，最后大家都认识了卫黄来和咱是一家，同时也认识到他儿是被敌人抓去的，是迫之无奈才当了伪军，领导上就诱导大家，将仇恨完全放到了敌人的身上。群众对卫黄来一变为同情和亲切的友谊态度，不但没斗没算，相反进行了安慰，大家在一块表了表心，黄来放宽了心，全家人感动得落眼泪，黄来又对大家说：“我也真是有苦没处诉，我孩当了伪军，还脱不过敌人的抢，去年腊月就抢了三次。我家没有一个人在八路军，但大家对我这样的好，也就是八路军对我的好。”他激奋的说：“我临死也不忘八路军，我一定跟他走。”由于这个斗争处理的得当，得到元王和附近各村同情和赞扬，群众的舆论也变了，对地主的造谣污蔑也给了一个有力的回答，连恶霸都只得说：“八路军能认得好坏人。”从这个问题解决后，有三十余家中农和一部小伪属户也卷入了斗争，从此中农互相间有问题，就采取表心思的办法，加以调解。中贫农一心对地主，清算运动将有新进展。
