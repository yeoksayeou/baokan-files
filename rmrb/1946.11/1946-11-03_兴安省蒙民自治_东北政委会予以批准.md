Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 31st. The Northeast Political Committee, at its ninth meeting on the 9th, approved the request submitted by Mongol leader Erqin Batu for the restoration of Mongol autonomy in the Hulunbuir region of Xing'an Province. This area is located in the northwest of Xing'an Province, administering six banners and one city (namely, the Erke Na Left and Right Banners, Chen Barag Banner, New Barag Left and Right Banners, Solon Banner, and Hailar City). The majority of the residents are of Mongolian ethnicity, and the economy is mainly pastoral. Before the "September 18th" Incident, it was originally an autonomous region, but autonomy was revoked after the Japanese invaders occupied it. The meeting also approved the resignation of Chen Yun, Chairman of the Northeast Finance Committee, and appointed Wang Shoudao as his successor. It also approved the establishment of the Northeast Social Investigation Institute and appointed Guan Mengjue as the deputy director, among other cases.
