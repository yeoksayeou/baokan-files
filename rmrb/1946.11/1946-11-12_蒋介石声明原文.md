Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 9th. According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing at 7:10 PM on the 8th, the Kuomintang Central Propaganda Department held a temporary press conference at 6:50 PM on the 8th, where Peng Xuepei read Chiang Kai-shek's statement. The full text of the statement is as follows:

On October 16th of this year, I issued a statement on behalf of the government regarding the handling of the current situation, including eight proposals as the basis for a cessation of conflict agreement, originally hoping that this statement would receive a response from the CCP to achieve the goal of a comprehensive ceasefire. Now, on the eve of the National Assembly, I specially reiterate the government's consistent policy of promoting domestic peace and national unity in order to achieve the goal of ending tutelage and beginning constitutional government. The government sincerely hopes that our country can achieve lasting peace and political stability. To realize this hope, it has already ordered the foreign armies within the customs, except for those necessary to defend their current locations, to cease other military actions.

According to the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, the National Assembly was originally scheduled to be convened on May 5th of this year, but the CCP and other parties refused to submit their list of representatives. On May 4th, the government announced that the National Assembly would be convened on November 12th, so that all parties could have four months to discuss and prepare. Regarding this point, the various parties expressed disagreement, saying that the steps for reorganizing the government agreed upon by the Political Consultative Conference had not yet been implemented. However, I would like to explain that since the closing of the Political Consultative Conference, the general situation has greatly changed in the past six months. Serious warfare occurred in the Northeast outside the customs and spread to North China, and the reorganization of the CCP's army has not yet begun in accordance with the agreed plan. Under these circumstances, political agreements have failed to bear fruit. Now, the representatives legally elected to the National Assembly have reported as scheduled, and the National Assembly cannot be postponed further to increase political and military instability and deepen the suffering of the people. Moreover, convening the National Assembly is the only legal step for the government to return power to the people and cannot be delayed any longer. Therefore, the government has decided that the National Assembly will convene as scheduled on November 12th.

My statement on October 16th already expressed the greatest concession, hoping that the CCP would accept it to resolve all outstanding issues. The government expects the CCP to follow the democratic path with all parties, and militarily, no political party should possess an army, and all armies should be the army of the state.

Therefore, the government, on the one hand, reserves the number of representatives that the CCP and other parties should send to the National Assembly, still hoping that they will participate in constitution-making at any time. On the other hand, it hopes that the CCP will immediately send representatives to participate in the Military Three-Person Group meeting to discuss the methods for ceasing conflict based on the points raised in my October 16th statement, as well as the future allocation of army stations, and methods for restoring transportation and reorganization and unification, in order to implement them as soon as possible.

Regarding the reorganization of the National Government Committee, it is hoped that an agreement can be reached as soon as possible so that it can be formally reorganized and established. As for the Executive Yuan, it is the actual responsible institution, and its reorganization must be more cautious. Therefore, no major changes can be made before the National Assembly is closed. Regarding the constitution, the government intends to submit to the National Assembly the uncompleted draft amendments of the Constitutional Draft Review Committee. Within six months after the closure of this National Assembly, a national general election will be held in accordance with the constitution. All parties and the people of the whole country can freely participate in the election at that time to produce the next National Assembly, which will exercise its statutory functions in accordance with the constitution. Therefore, before the next National Assembly, if any party has any opinions on amending the constitution, they can still propose amendments according to law.

These few weeks are a crucial key to the rise and fall of the country. If we can do our best, it will not be difficult to establish a strong, prosperous, and democratic China. We must overcome any prejudices, suspicions, and hatred, and transcend all difficulties to contribute to the interests of the whole people. Today, the most urgent need of the people of the whole country is peace and stability. I sincerely hope that comrades of our party, people from all parties, social elites, government colleagues, all officers and soldiers, and people from all relevant parties must unite sincerely and cooperate closely to achieve the goals of "political democratization" and "army nationalization" in a peaceful manner.

    蒋介石声明原文
    【新华社延安九日电】据中央社南京八日下午七时十分电：国民党中宣部八日下午六时五十分，举行临时记者招待会，由彭学沛宣读蒋介石之声明。声明全文如次：
    本年十月十六日，余曾发表政府关于处理目前时局的声明，并包括八项作为停止冲突协议之基础的提议，原冀此项声明，能得中共之答复，以达全面停战之目的。今当国民大会开会之前夕，余特重新声明政府一贯之政策，在促进国内和平，全国统一，以求达到结束训政，开始宪政之目的。政府真诚期望我全国能获得永久之和平及政治之安定，为实现此种期望，兹已明令关内外国军，除为防守现地所必须者外，停止其他军事行动。
    依照政治协商会议所决议，国民大会原应于本年五月五日召开，但中共与各党派拒绝提出其代表之名单，复于五月四日，政府宣布国民大会于十一月十二日召开，俾各党派可于此四个月期间作一切之商讨与准备。对于此点，各党派曾表示异议，谓政协所同意改组政府之步骤尚未实行，惟余欲有所说明者，自政协会议闭会以来，此半年间，一般情势已大有变迁，关外东北严重之战事发生后，又蔓及于华北，而中共军队之整编，迄未依照协议之方案而开始实行。在此种状况之下，政治协议，遂未能获得结果。现国民大会依法选出之代表均已如期报到，国民大会实不能再予延期，以增加政治军事之不安，而加深人民之痛苦。且召开国民大会为政府还政于民惟一合法的步骤，亦不能再有稽延。因此政府已决定，国民大会于十一月十二日如期开会。
    余在十月十六日之声明，实已表示最大之忍让，希望中共予以接受，以解决一切未决问题。政府对于中共期待其与各党派同循民主之轨辙，而在军事上必须使任何政党皆不能拥有军队，而任何军队均应为国家之军队。
    因此政府一面保留中共及其他党派在国民大会应出之代表名额，仍望其随时参加制宪，一面希望中共立即派出代表，参加军事三人小组会议，根据余十月十六日声明所提之各点，商谈停止冲突办法与今后军队驻地分配，以及恢复交通与整编统编等办法，以期从速施行。
    关于国府委员会之改组，望能早日获得协议，俾得正式改组成立。至于行政院则为实际负责之机构，其改组必须更加慎重，故国民大会未闭会以前，不能作此重大之变更。关于宪章，政府拟向国民大会提出宪草审议会未完成之修正草案，此次国民大会闭会以后六个月内，即依照宪法举行全国普选。各党派与全国人民，届时均可自由竞选，以产生下届国民大会，根据宪法所规定，而行使其法定之职权。故各党派在下届国民大会前，对于宪法如有修改意见，仍可依法提出修正。
    此数周内，实为关系国家盛衰之重要关键，吾人如能竭尽努力，即不难树立强盛繁荣民主的中国之基础，吾人必须克服任何偏见猜疑仇恨之情绪，并超脱一切困难以贡献于全民之利益。今日全国人民最迫切之需要，实为和平与安定，余深望本党同志，各党派人士，社会贤达，政府同人，全体官兵以及各有关方面之人士，务必精诚团结，通力合作，以和平的方式达成“政治民主化”，“军队国家化”之目标。
