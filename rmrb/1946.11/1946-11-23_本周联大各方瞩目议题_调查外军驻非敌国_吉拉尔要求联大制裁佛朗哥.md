　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th: New York dispatch: The most noteworthy topic at this week's United Nations conference is the issue raised by the Soviet Union regarding the investigation of member states' foreign troops stationed within the borders of non-enemy countries. This proposal will be discussed at the Political and Security Committee of the United Nations General Assembly. The committee has agreed to France's suggestion to postpone the discussion of the veto power issue for ten days. This issue was discussed by the five major powers' foreign ministers at a meeting on the 18th, but no results were achieved. On the 19th, the United Nations General Assembly had its first session with 54 countries participating because Afghanistan, Sweden, and Iceland held formal signing ceremonies to join the United Nations on that day. At the same meeting, Belgium, Colombia, and Syria were elected to replace the Netherlands, Mexico, and Egypt as non-permanent members of the Security Council for a two-year term.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th: New York dispatch: Giral, the Prime Minister of the Spanish Republic in exile, issued a statement to the press here on the 18th, demanding that the United Nations General Assembly impose economic sanctions on Franco and sever relations with him. Giral promised to hold free elections and rebuild a democratic government within twelve months after Franco's overthrow.
