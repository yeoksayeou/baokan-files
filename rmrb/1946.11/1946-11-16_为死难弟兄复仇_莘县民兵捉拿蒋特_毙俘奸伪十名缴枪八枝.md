    Avenging the Death of Our Brothers
    Xin County Militia Captures Chiang Kai-shek's Spies
    Executes and Captures Ten Traitors and Puppets, Seizes Eight Guns
    [Report from this newspaper in Xin County] The militia in Gezhuang and surrounding areas of this county killed and captured ten armed special agents, including Zhang Baozhen, in late September, creating an example of militia fighting against special agents. After the peasants of this county turned themselves around, mass organizations have become increasingly sound. Kuomintang special agents, with Jinan as their nest, have been extending their claws to this county. Ge Jinrong, a landlord in Gezhuang, colluded with four traitors including Zhang Baozhen, and killed militia member Ge Guangbin and his son before the wheat harvest. After also wounding the chairman of the farmers' association and four others, they fled to the Kuomintang in Jinan and received 130,000 yuan in compensation. On September 27th, led by Zhang Baozhen and Ge Jinrong, two of them secretly sneaked into Zhangzhuang and Shili Jing villages, two miles southwest of Gezhuang, with two pistols, in an attempt to expand their power, collect weapons from the Zhangzhuang militia, and beat and kill village cadres and militia members. After the militia侦察knew about it, they quickly notified the militia in Huangloudian, Duantun, and other villages before and after, gathered twelve people, and went in two groups to Shili Jing and Zhangzhuang. The special agent Zhang Baozhen fired shots outwards, and was shot by the militia member Ge Guanglin. The special agent Wang Ruhai was driven back by a volley of bullets from the militia and was later captured. After the battle of Shili Jing ended, everyone immediately went to Zhangzhuang to provide assistance, and they also hunted down Ge Jinrong and Zhang Zhaojun. This time, the special agent Zhang Baozhen was killed, and the special agents Ge Jinrong, Zhang Zhaojun, and Wang Ruhai were captured. Two pistols and eleven bullets were seized, along with over 1,000 yuan in Ji banknotes, 500 yuan in customs gold, and over 3,000 yuan in legal currency. The militia triumphantly escorted the special agents to the Public Security Bureau.
    At the memorial meeting for militia member Ge Guangbin, the militia and self-defense forces of the village and surrounding villages were very resentful. In order to avenge Guangbin and his son, the militia often cooperated with the Public Security Bureau to capture special agents in villages around Yanggu. Six special agents, including Ding Yuancheng, have now been captured, and two large guns, two pistols, and two missing guns have been seized. Their anti-special agent work is in full swing, and the county Armed Forces Committee will issue a commendation. (Wu Qun)
