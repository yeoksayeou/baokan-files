Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 1st: A report from our correspondent active in the suburbs of Zhangjiakou City states: Zhangjiakou, the people's paradise, and the cities along the Ping-Sui Railway have been trampled into a bloody hell by murderers like Fu Zuoyi. Chiang's planes have carried out three days of frantic bombing, causing significant devastation to this beautiful city. When Fu Zuoyi's troops sneaked into Zhangjiakou, only the roaring of flames and explosions were visible and faintly audible from thirty miles away. Fu's troops hesitated for a long time before cautiously entering the city. However, Fu Zuoyi quickly discovered that what he had occupied was not a city, but an endless sea of hatred. People moved to the liberated areas in the surrounding countryside. Several orders were issued to open the shops, but they were sternly refused. A mass meeting was convened, but the venue was almost empty. Even a huge sum of 100,000 yuan was offered to recruit a police officer, but no one responded. At night, due to the loss of electricity, the whole city was dark, and only the sound of Fu's puppet troops looting and threatening the people with guns could be heard.

Fu Zuoyi wanted to use bloody terrorist rule to suppress these resistant people. After arriving in Zhangjiakou on the 17th, he established a "Garrison Headquarters," a "Military-Civilian Cooperation Committee" (with special agent Zhou Jun as director), and a "Military-Political Inspection Team." Learning from the old tricks of the Japanese invaders, he "launched a public order campaign," forcing citizens to "confess" and announcing a reward of 300,000 yuan in legal tender for "reporting" a "Communist army cadre." He ordered citizens to "hand over Communist army supplies," otherwise, a massacre would be carried out. Near Shalingzi Station, an escaped worker tearfully told the reporter: "We had only had a year of good days, and we were looking forward to a happier life. This group of devils who ran away when they saw the Japanese devils and killed the Chinese people, relying on the help of the American foreign fathers, trampled on our Zhangjiakou again." He then confidently said: "Look! One day they will know how powerful the people of Zhangjiakou are!"

On a certain riverbank, the reporter saw the heroic field army commanders and fighters, who were as strong as ever and full of vigor. When talking about the disasters that the people of Zhangjiakou and the Ping-Sui Railway were suffering from Chiang Kai-shek and his running dogs like Fu Zuoyi, a soldier slammed the table and angrily said to everyone: "Comrades! I am from Zhangjiakou. Although I am a new soldier, I will never give up until I drive out these murderous devils!" Currently, our Zhangjiakou Municipal Government and people's organizations are leading the people in the suburbs of Zhangjiakou to persist in the struggle.

　　蒋军蹂躏践踏下
    张家口沦为血海地狱
    【新华社晋察冀一日电】据活动在张垣市郊的本社记者报导：人民的乐园张家口，及平绥沿线各城市，已被傅作义等辈杀人犯践踏为血海地狱，蒋机连续三天的疯狂轰炸已使这座美丽的城市，遭受重大摧残。当傅作义部窜抵张垣时，但见熊熊烈火爆炸的轰鸣，卅里外犹隐约可闻。傅部迟疑良久，始小心翼翼进入城内，但很快的傅作义便发现他所侵占的，不是一座城市，而是跳进了一个无边的仇恨的大海。人民纷纷向四乡解放区迁移，几次下令商店开业，均严遭闭门拒绝。召集群众大会会场，门可罗雀。以十万元巨金招募一警察，亦无人应顾。入夜因电灯丧失，全城漆黑，只闻傅军伪匪，四出抢劫时，威胁良民的枪声。傅作义想用血腥的特务统治来镇压这些反抗的人民。十七日他到张垣后，就成立“警备司令部”、“军民合作委员会”（以特务周钧为主任），“军政检查队”。学习日寇老套“开展治安运动”，强迫市民“自首”，宣布“检举”一名“共军干部”赏洋三十万法币。勒令市民“交出共军物资”，否则将实行大屠杀。在沙岭子车站附近，一个逃出的工人含着眼泪哭诉记者说：“才说过了一年好日子，眼望着以后的生活更幸福，这批见了日本鬼子就跑、见了中国老百姓就杀的魔王，靠着美国洋爸爸帮忙，把咱们张家口又给践踏破了”。他继即有信心的说：“看吧！总有一天叫他知道张家口人民的厉害”！记者在某一河地上，见着英勇野战军指战员时，他们一样的精神健壮，满面红光。谈到张家口和平绥沿线人民正在遭受着蒋介石及其走狗傅作义之辈带来的灾难时，一个战士把桌子一拍，气愤的向大家说：“同志们！我是张家口人，虽然我是一个新战士，可是要不把这些杀人魔王赶出去，我是誓不罢休的”。现我张家口市政府及人民团体，均在张垣市郊领导人民坚持斗争。
