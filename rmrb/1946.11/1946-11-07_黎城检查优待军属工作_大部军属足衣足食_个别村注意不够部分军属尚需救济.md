　　Li Cheng Inspects Work on Preferential Treatment for Military Families
    Most Military Families Have Sufficient Food and Clothing
    Some Villages Lack Attention, Some Military Families Still Need Relief
    [Reported by Our Newspaper from Li Cheng] In order to ensure that soldiers on the front lines can fight the enemy with peace of mind for a long time, the Li Cheng County Government organized a comprehensive inspection of the work of preferential treatment for military families in the county at the beginning of this month, and also invited representatives of local garrison troops and retired soldiers to participate. According to the inspection results, thanks to the universal and practical assistance of the masses, among the 2,978 military families, cadre families, and retired soldiers in the county, 1,621 have reached the level of having one-third surplus after farming, and 1,127 have enough food and clothing. However, some village cadres and the masses still have muddled ideas, so 251 households still need relief. Individual substitute farmers have left military families' land uncultivated, some villages do not provide preferential treatment to families of martyrs and military families from other villages, and some villages only make temporary, perfunctory efforts. After education and ideological clarification, it was decided that in the future: 1. Make long-term plans to establish livelihoods for military and cadre families and retired soldiers, eliminate impoverished households, and enable all of them to reach the level of having one-third surplus after farming. At the same time, military and cadre families and retired soldiers should also overcome the mentality of relying on preferential treatment and establish their livelihoods through their own labor. 2. Emphasize respect for military families. When solving their problems, listen to their opinions more and respect their honor. 3. Fix substitute farmers to ensure that no land of military families is left uncultivated. 4. Establish a system of checking the work of preferential treatment for military families on the four major festivals of the Lantern Festival, Dragon Boat Festival, Mid-Autumn Festival, and Gregorian New Year to make it regularized.

　　黎城检查优待军属工作
    大部军属足衣足食
    个别村注意不够部分军属尚需救济
    【本报黎城讯】为使前线战士长期安心杀敌，黎城县府特于本月初组织全县优待军属工作大检查，并吸收当地驻军和荣退军人代表参加。据检查结果，由于群众普遍切实的帮助，全县二千九百七十八户军属、干属和荣退军人中，已有一千六百二十一户达到耕三余一，一千一百二十七户达到足衣足食。但亦有少数村干和群众存有糊涂观念，故尚有二百五十一户需要救济。个别代耕户给军属荒了地，有的村子不优待烈属及外村来的军属，有的村子临时突击一下就过去了。经过教育打通思想后决定今后要：一、长期打算，为军、干属，荣退军人建立家务，消灭赤贫户，并使全部达到耕三余一。同时军、干属、荣退军人亦要克服依赖优待思想，以自己劳动来建立家务。二、强调尊敬军属。解决他们的问题时多倾听其意见和尊重其荣誉。三、固定代耕户，保证不荒军属一亩地。四、确立元宵、端阳、中秋、阳历年四大节日的优待军属工作检查制度，使之经常化。（新文、砚良、宗岱、履端）
