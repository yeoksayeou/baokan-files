　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 24th: Moscow, 23rd: Soviet commentator Macsinu’s "On the Question of US Troops Stationed in China." After the end of the war, there is no longer any reason for foreign troops to be stationed on the territory of non-enemy countries. On the 21st, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov raised this issue in the UN Security Council for the sake of universal peace and security in the world. Macsinu said: "The landing of US troops in China took place after the complete end of World War II and after the Japanese army had surrendered. The US troops were nominally there to disarm the Japanese army and send them back home, but the landing sites were in areas where the Japanese army was not concentrated and in the areas of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Army, and their intention was very obvious. After the US troops landed, not only did they not immediately disarm the Japanese army, but they used the Japanese army to assist the Kuomintang army in attacking the liberated areas." Last December, the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference discussed the issue of US troops in China. According to Benes' statement, the resolution of the conference on the China issue stated: "As long as the US troops carry out the disarmament of the Japanese army and the repatriation of Japanese prisoners, they should withdraw from North China." But today this situation no longer exists, but the US troops are still staying in China to continue to support the Chinese reactionaries in carrying out anti-democratic struggles, which has made the Chinese civil war unprecedentedly expanded, and the day of peace is still unknown. Chinese and American public opinion has expressed intolerance towards this. According to Chinese and American public opinion, he said that the continued stationing of US troops in China is a major obstacle to China's achieving peace. If US troops withdraw from China, the Chinese people will be able to immediately eliminate the civil war and establish domestic peace.

　　马西努评美军驻华破坏和平
    中美社会舆论表示不能容忍
    【新华社延安二十四日电】莫斯科二十三日电：苏评论员马西努“论美军驻华问题”。战争结束以后，外国军队驻于非敌国领土已是再无任何理由了。二十一日，苏外长莫洛托夫在联合国安理会提出此一问题，乃是为了世界普遍和平安全的利益。马西努说：“美军在华登陆，是在第二次世界大战完全结束，日军已经投降以后。美军名为解除日军武装及遣送回国，但登陆地点却在日军并不集中的地区及中国人民革命军的地区，其用意至为明显。美军登陆后，不但不立即解其武装，反利用日军协助国民党军进攻解放区”。去年十二月，莫斯科外长会议曾讨论美军在华问题。会议关于中国问题的决议案，据贝纳斯的声明说：“美军只要执行解除日军武装与遣送日俘，即当退出华北。”而今天此项情况已不存在，美军却仍留在中国继续支持中国反动分子，进行反民主斗争，已使中国内战空前扩大，而和平之日还不知何时到来。中美社会舆论对此已表示不能容忍了。他根据中美社会舆论说，美军现续驻中国，是中国达到和平的重大障碍，如果美军退出中国，中国人民是能够立即消灭内战，树立国内和平的。
