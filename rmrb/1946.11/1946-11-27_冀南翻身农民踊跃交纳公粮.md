The turned-over peasants in Southern Hebei eagerly deliver public grain, fully demonstrating the increased awareness of the peasants and their love for the soldiers. The masses said one after another: "To defeat Chiang Kai-shek and live a good life, it is the bounden duty of the common people to hand over public grain." The First District of Xiajin put forward the slogan "Everyone should strive to be a model in grain delivery" and "Deliver early, deliver well." The entire district completed the delivery in three days. In Yongnian, all villages were husking rice and ginning cotton day and night, and × Village in the Sixth District completed the delivery in one day. Many people voluntarily delivered more, saying, "We can take a little more out and be thrifty, it is our responsibility to fight Chiang Kai-shek for the front line." In the village of Qizhiwanzi, the middle peasant members of the agricultural cooperative played a exemplary role in grain delivery. Wei Guangrong, the director of the agricultural cooperative, said: "To defend the liberated area, I will take out eighty more catties. If Chiang Kai-shek is defeated, we will have everything." Under his influence, other members took out thirty catties, twenty catties, etc., and the whole village exceeded the quota by seven hundred catties. Guanzhuang Village in En County is a newly liberated village. When delivering grain, the elementary school students ran around in the streets shouting: "If you want to defeat the invading army, hand over the public grain quickly!" The entire amount was delivered in half a day. Fourteen poor peasant members of the agricultural cooperative in Nanhanzhuang voluntarily delivered twenty catties of millet and two thousand three hundred and sixty yuan to support their savior, the Communist Party's Eighth Route Army.

    【本报威县二十五日电】冀南翻身农民踊跃交纳公粮，充分表现了农民觉悟提高和对子弟兵的爱护。群众纷纷说：“为打退蒋介石过好日子，老百姓交公粮是应尽的义务。”夏津一区提出“人人要争取交粮模范”；“交的早、交的好”的口号，全区三天即已交齐。永年各村连夜碾米轧花，六区×庄一天就交齐了。许多群众自动多交，都说：“咱们多拿点东西，俭省些就行了，为前线，打蒋介石是咱们的责任”。企之湾子村在交粮中农会员都起了模范作用，农会主任魏光荣说：“为保卫解放区，我多拿八十斤，打退蒋介石啥也有了”。在他的影响下，其他会员都多拿三十斤、二十斤的不等，全村超过应纳数七百斤。恩县管庄是新解放不久的村子，交粮时小学生在街上东奔西跑的喊着：“要想打退进犯军，赶快交公粮。”半日全部交齐。南韩庄十四户贫苦农会员自动多交二十斤小米，二千三百六十元，以拥护他们的救命恩人共产党八路军。
