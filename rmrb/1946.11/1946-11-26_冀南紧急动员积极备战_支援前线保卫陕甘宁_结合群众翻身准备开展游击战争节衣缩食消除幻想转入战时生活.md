    【Our newspaper, Weixian, 21st dispatch】 The military and civilians throughout the Southern Hebei region are urgently mobilizing and actively preparing for war, to defend Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, defend Chairman Mao, support the frontlines, and crush Chiang Kai-shek's attacks. The leading organs of the ninth sub-district Party, government, military, and civilians have issued a joint emergency circular, calling on all the military and civilians of the sub-district to take swift action and complete the following three tasks: (1) Strengthen war preparations. In areas that may be affected by the war, such as Daming, Linzhang, and Handan, command headquarters at the county, district, and village levels should be established as soon as possible to achieve strong, unified leadership. On the basis of the masses' emancipation, prepare for mass-based guerrilla warfare by digging underground shelters and tunnels, manufacturing explosives, and launching an explosion campaign. The bombing of Daming by Chiang's aircraft should be made known to every household, using concrete examples to shatter illusions about peace with Chiang Kai-shek and the United States, and be prepared to repel Chiang Kai-shek's attacks at any time. (2) Immediately implement air defense measures and universally dig air raid shelters. (3) All organizations and groups should reduce unnecessary personnel, practice thrift, quickly transition to wartime life, strengthen militia leadership, and persist in the struggle against the enemy. The armed training team of the sub-district Military Affairs Committee held a swearing-in ceremony before graduation. The second platoon of the first company solemnly said during the oath-taking: "We are the armed forces of the peasants, we swear to defend the masses to the death, without compromise, without surrender, without corruption, without embezzlement, resolutely obey the leadership of our superiors, and fight Chiang Kai-shek to the end. We will forever follow Chairman Mao and defend Chairman Mao. If we violate the above oath, we are willing to accept severe punishment from our superiors." Minister Cao of the sub-district said: "The time has come. Chiang Kai-shek is ready to attack Yan'an. Let us fight intensely, contain the enemy's offensive, and let the invading army die in the border region." On November 11, Linqing City held a mobilization meeting for all cadres and staff of the municipal government to prepare for war. Mayor Hei clearly pointed out that it is necessary to overcome complacency, make all organs combat-ready, pack light, send documents and families home temporarily, be ready to meet the enemy's attack anytime, anywhere, and fight Chiang Kai-shek to the death. Victory will surely be ours." Xin County is conducting a current affairs propaganda week in all districts. The second district held a mobilization meeting of ten thousand people to denounce Chiang Kai-shek's crimes of betraying the country. In the end, it was proposed that to keep one's livelihood, one must join the army to fight old Chiang. The first district held a mass meeting to struggle against little Chiang Kai-shek, Zou Quanyang (a special agent). The meeting revealed that Zou Quanyang relied on the enemy, harmed the masses, provoked relations among the masses, created rumors, and engaged in espionage activities. Zou Quanyang admitted everything. The masses attending the meeting said one after another: "Little Chiang Kai-shek is so bad, old Chiang Kai-shek must be even worse." The masses all realized that if old Chiang came, they would not be able to turn over, and only by actively joining the army could they protect their homes and land. The seventh district held a celebration meeting for nearly 8,000 emancipated peasants. At the meeting, the peasants recalled the past and compared it with the present. Everyone said in unison: "One day away from the Communist Party, one day cannot be emancipated. To keep one's livelihood, one must join the army to fight old Chiang." Under the call to defend Chairman Mao and defend themselves, entire rows and platoons from villages such as Huangloudian registered to join the army. After receiving the task of 200 stretchers from the county command headquarters, the fifth district saw young and middle-aged men from all villages actively participate in the stretcher team. In less than half a day, all 200 stretchers arrived at the assembly point. The children's corps and sisters' corps at home launched a "one chicken, one handful of noodles" movement to prepare to comfort the wounded passing by. When the wounded passed through villages such as Shangdian, Xisongzhuang, and Linlou, the children's corps, women's rescue association, and sisters' corps comforted them one after another. One wounded soldier, receiving a gift from a girl, said with emotion: "Little sister, you are too good. When I get better, I will go to the front line to fight old Chiang and protect our hometown, not letting Chiang Kai-shek come to kill us." After receiving an emergency notice from the county command headquarters to mill rice and grind flour, the sixth district of Yuanchao carried it out all night. Sunjia Village milled 700 jin of rice that night. In this small village of 55 households, all men, women, old, and young mobilized and completed the assigned task overnight. Under the fervent call to support the front line, Thirty-Four Village milled 30,000 jin of rice and ground 7,000 jin of flour in one day.
