　　【This Newspaper Reported】When Chiang Kai-shek's troops attacked Baobi in Huixian on October 17th, the Ninth District Command immediately organized militia joint defense teams and militia work teams, led by district cadres themselves, to persist in border struggles and combat the landlord "Home-Returning Corps," achieving great success. When Chiang Kai-shek's troops attacked, they organized all the landlords and traitors who had fled during the mass movement and brought them back, using them as pawns to kill and plunder the masses. They returned to intimidate the masses, entice militiamen to surrender their guns, and mobilize landlords' lackeys who remained at home to flee south... Because they were familiar with the local situation, they posed the greatest harm to the masses. On October 30th, the head of the "Home-Returning Corps," Ren Kechang (from Liuwan Village in the Ninth District), led more than twenty lackeys to Liuwan Village to rob the masses of eight cartloads of grain, plunder furniture, force people to maintain order, and threaten the families of militiamen to call back their people to surrender their guns. After hearing about the situation, the militia teams in the Ninth District immediately put forward the slogan "Surrendering guns means no way to live, we must resolutely struggle," and everyone unanimously resolved to fight to the end.

　　One day and night, the militiamen were so excited they couldn't sleep half the night. At dawn, they set out to fiercely strike the Chiang Kai-shek bandits and the grain-robbing team combined with traitors. In the morning, the grain-robbing team carelessly dragged their guns and came over. Our militia work team quickly fired a signal gun, suddenly surrounding the enemy, and with a burst of shouts and gunfire, killed four enemies, captured a fleeing landlord named Zhang Tiande from Mengzhuang, and seized one rifle and more than ten bullets. The team members triumphantly returned singing Chairman Mao's songs along the way.

　　【Another item of news】After the fleeing landlord Zhang Tiande was captured by our militia, a public trial meeting was immediately held. The masses from nearby villages also came to participate and celebrate this victory of the militia's ambush, and to settle accounts with this traitorous landlord Zhang Tiande who colluded with the Chiang Kai-shek bandits to harm the people. The militiamen of Mengzhuang were overjoyed and pointed at Zhang Tiande, demanding the return of the big yellow ox that had been extorted from him two years ago. Many family members also accused him of the blood feud of their parents who had been murdered. Yang Wenqing's father from Xiaoxinzhuang in the Ninth District, and Zhang Lan's mother, were both killed by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits and the "Home-Returning Corps" that night. Everyone shouted with excitement: "We must avenge the murdered villagers!" Finally, the district command approved everyone's request and sentenced Zhang Tiande to death by firing squad according to the law.

    【本报讯】辉县蒋军在十月十七日向我薄壁进攻时，我九区区指挥部就立即组织起民兵联防队与民兵武工队，由区干部亲自带领，坚持边沿斗争，打击地主“还乡队”，获得很大成绩。蒋军进攻时，将群运中逃跑的地主奸霸，全部组织起来带领回来，作为杀害人民与抢掠群众的爪牙。他们回来威吓群众，利诱民兵投降交枪，动员留在家里的地主狗腿、向南逃跑……因他们熟悉本地情况给群众的危害最大。十月三十日、“还乡队”头子任克昌（九区柳湾村人）带领二十几个喽罗，到柳湾村抢运群众的粮食八大车，并抢掠家具，强迫维持，威胁民兵家属叫回人来交枪。我九区各队民兵，听到情况后、立即提出“交枪活不成，要坚决斗争”的口号，大家一致决心斗争到底。
    一日夜，民兵们兴奋的半夜没睡，拂晓即出发准备痛击蒋伪与奸霸结合的抢粮队。上午抢粮队不在意的拖着枪过来了。我民兵武工队迅速的响起信号枪，突然将敌包围，一阵杀声、枪声、将敌人打死四名，活捉孟庄的逃亡地主张天德一名，缴获步枪一枝、子弹十余发，队员们一路上唱着毛主席的歌子胜利而归。
    【又息】逃亡地主张天德被我民兵捉回后，当即召开公审大会，周围附近各村群众，也都来参加、庆祝这次民兵打埋伏的胜利，并向这个勾结蒋伪残害人民的奸霸地主张天德算账，孟庄的民兵大喜，指着张天德要他两年前被讹去的大黄牛，不少家属纷纷控诉他们父母被残杀的血仇。九区小新庄杨文清的父亲，与张蓝的母亲，都是这次蒋伪军和“还乡队”黑夜杀死的，大家激奋的高喊：“要为被害的乡亲报仇”。最后，区指挥部批准大家要求，当将张天德依法枪决。
