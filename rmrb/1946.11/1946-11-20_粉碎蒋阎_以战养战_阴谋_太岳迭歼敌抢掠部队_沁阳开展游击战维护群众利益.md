    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 19th dispatch] In the past half month, our local armed forces and militia in Pingyao, in order to smash Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan's "using war to support war" plot, from the 1st to the 15th of this month, have four times repelled the raiding and plundering by three regiments of Yan's puppet troops, killing 50 and capturing 56 of them. In a battle at Dongyayao and Zhuqi on the afternoon of the 1st, an entire company of Yan's puppet 219th Regiment was annihilated, with 28 officers and soldiers, including the company commander and deputy company commander, killed on the spot. Furthermore, more than 100 Chiang's troops and special agent "Revenge Squad" stationed in Yuanqu raided and plundered Ruicun area of our Wangwu Second District on the 2nd, but were routed by more than 50 militiamen and backbone troops led by the commander of our Second District. More than 10 Chiang's soldiers and special agents were killed or wounded, five arrested people were liberated, and seven cattle and three pigs were recovered. None of our personnel were injured or killed. Encouraged by this victory, the local militia guerrillas have been active in the Taishenmiao and Xiecun areas near Yuanqu City, and destroyed five bunkers.
    [This newspaper, Changzhi, 9th dispatch] Since Chiang's troops occupied Qinyang, our local armed forces, combined with the militia, have formed several guerrilla groups to strike the enemy everywhere in the past half month. On the 17th of last month, the stubborn county magistrate Li Deji led more than 100 members of the security regiment, carrying two machine guns, to rob grain in Fancun, and were night-attacked by our independent battalion militia, the stubborn troops fled in panic. On the 19th, the stubborn puppet district chief Chen Changyu led more than 100 stubborn troops to commit crimes in Xixiang, coercing the masses to hold meetings, and were dispersed by us. At dawn on the 24th, Chen, enraged, led his troops of more than 200 to attack Xixiang again, but was bravely repelled by our independent battalion militia, and four stubborn troops were killed, while we suffered no casualties. Under the continuous attacks of our guerrilla groups, the stubborn troops were forced to withdraw the Gaozhuang stronghold. The guerrilla group that penetrated into the south of the Qin River, on the evening of the 19th, launched a fierce attack on the Wangqu stronghold, and recaptured the area, capturing one stubborn soldier, seizing one rifle, more than 200 rounds of ammunition, and capturing three section chiefs and staff members of the stubborn county government. On the 18th, another guerrilla group of ours captured two Chiang's special agents in Quzhuang, and that night raided the enemy's Gaocun stronghold, and the defending enemy was driven away, capturing one enemy soldier, seizing one locally made rifle, and 30 rounds of ammunition. Now the vast enemy-occupied area of Qinyang is completely in the hands of our army and people, and our powerful guerrilla groups are warmly supported by the masses, and the mass guerrilla warfare is raging in the villages occupied by Chiang. In the past half month, some local despots and landlords, under the fierce flames of Chiang's stubborn troops, attempted to seize the fruits of struggle from the masses. But seeing our powerful armed forces, they are now saying good things to the masses or returning things to the masses. In order to carry out mass guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines, a unit of our main force has advanced behind enemy lines. On the 25th of last month, it cooperated with the local armed forces to attack the enemy's Weicun stronghold, and after six hours of fierce fighting, more than 50 Chiang's stubborn soldiers were killed or wounded, which greatly encouraged the local masses.
