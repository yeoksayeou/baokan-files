    Brighton Dispatch: At the invitation of the British Trades Union Congress, the secretary of the Central Council of Soviet Trade Unions, who had arrived in Britain, delivered a speech at the Congress, emphasizing that British and Soviet workers should further consolidate their friendship and cooperation. He pointed out that currently, "reactionaries are even more arrogantly attacking the vital interests of the working class, attempting to divide the unity of the trade unions."
    Netherlands News Agency, October 23rd: Although the Dutch-Indonesian-British ceasefire agreement has been signed, Dutch troops continue to attack Indonesian forces in southern West Java and near Bandung. Meanwhile, on October 20th, another 6,000 Dutch troops landed near Batavia. The Deputy Governor-General of Sumatra, Gali, issued a statement to the press stating that the people of Sumatra will take a hostile attitude towards the landing of Dutch troops in eastern Sumatra. The Indonesian people continue to resist British and Dutch forces near Padang and Medan.
    United Press, Shanghai, October 25th: Following a formal protest by the Soviet Consul, Archbishop Victor, who had previously been arrested by the Kuomintang authorities, was released on bail from Ward Road Prison last night after posting a "surety" of $5,000. The Archbishop immediately returned to St. Nicholas Church. More than 5,000 Soviet expatriates, who learned of the news through extra editions of Russian newspapers, gathered at the church to celebrate.
    United Press, Tehran, October 24th: The former Iranian Minister of Propaganda and newly appointed Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Prince Firouz, issued a statement on Iranian foreign policy, stating: We are willing to establish closer relations with the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union was generous to us in the 1920 covenant; after I take up my new position, I will prove to the Iranian people that the Soviet Union is still generous.
    The Minister of Agriculture and Commerce of the Burmese Provisional Government, Deng Pi, resigned from the government on the 24th. Deng is one of the communist leaders, and his reason for resigning was opposition to the internal and external policies of the group within the provisional government headed by Aung San. The vacancy has been filled by Mei Ya (one of the leaders of the Anti-Fascist League).
