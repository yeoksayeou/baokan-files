The War Has Tested the People of Southern Shanxi
He Wei

On July 3rd, Chiang Kai-shek, with the forces of the 47th Division, 78th Division, 31st Division, 167th Division, and 72nd Division, directly threatened the survival of the people of Southern Shanxi. The Eighth Route Army calmly resisted on one hand, and on the other, lured Chiang's troops deep in order to eliminate their active forces. By July 12th, Chiang's troops, using airplanes and tanks to cover their infantry, captured more than 460 liberated area villages and towns such as Shuitou, Yanzhang, Huzhang, Guodian, and Wenxi, at the cost of heavy casualties. The occupation lasted only ten days. On the 13th, the Eighth Route Army, with the support of hundreds of thousands of people, began a counterattack. In the three fierce battles of Yanzhang, Ruyi Shangchao, and Songdian, they annihilated the 31st Division, 167th Division, and part of the 78th Division of Chiang's army, totaling more than 3,500 men. The bravery and unity of the army and people in the liberated areas completely shattered Chiang Kai-shek's plan to occupy Southern Shanxi. On the 16th, Chiang's troops had no choice but to roll out of the occupied land. In mid-August, Chiang Kai-shek reassembled a large force from Henan and Shaanxi, including six of his own brigades (three of which were American-equipped) and three brigades of the Northwest Army, totaling about 70,000 men, which can be described as an "all-out invasion." They wanted to push the Eighth Route Army towards the Zhongtiao Mountains, with the eastern flank along the foothills of the Zhongtiao Mountains, the western flank relying on the foothills of the Jiwang Mountains, and the middle relying on the Tongpu Railway. Especially after Chiang's troops invaded the Jiangxian-Yuanqu highway on August 27th, the situation seemed to deteriorate even further. The 300,000 soldiers and civilians of Southern Shanxi were sealed off by Chiang's troops in a triangular area. From then until September 25th, Chiang's troops carried out three more "encirclement and suppression" campaigns in the Zhongtiao Mountain area. But no force could force the people to submit to the enemy. The people have stubbornly lived in the new struggle. The vast guerrilla forces, in an unprecedented manner, went down from the mountain corners and into the plains of Southern Shanxi. On September 6th, the guerrillas, with the cooperation of local militia, simultaneously attacked five Chiang's army strongholds in Pinglu, Maojindu, Taiyangdu, Shengrenjian, and Dachen, and recovered Maojindu, an important Yellow River ferry. They completely annihilated the Chiang's army garrison in Taiyangdu. They forced Chiang's troops to withdraw their troops from the mountains and strengthen their strongholds.

The militia guerrilla team led by Ren Keliang in Xia County sabotaged Chiang's army's communication and liaison everywhere, and dismantled Chiang's army's telephone lines. The communications platoon of Chiang's army stationed in Zaoyuan was ordered to set up two wired telephone lines from Xia County to Huzhang, and from Huzhang to Cuijiahe. When they set up the line from Xia County to Huzhang, the Xia County section had already been cut off by Ren Keliang's guerrillas. When Huzhang set up the line to Cuijiahe, the Huzhang section was cut off again. The platoon leader of Chiang's communications platoon was reprimanded by his superiors, ran outside Zaoyuan village, wept quietly, and cursed the guerrillas. Chiang's army buried the telephone lines in the ground and barely set them up, but they were cut off again by the guerrillas in the evening. Finally, Chiang's army adopted the Japanese invaders' method of "human telephone poles," grabbing a civilian to guard each telephone pole. But when the guerrillas came, they cut off the telephone lines together with the guerrillas.

Chiang's army was greatly threatened by the guerrillas. The guard troops dispatched to Guozhen were attacked by the guerrillas for four consecutive days. They sent a report to the commander of the 91st Regiment, pleading: "This place is constantly attacked by guerrillas, and the losses are serious. We can move back to the city to garrison." On August 18th, this group of Chiang's troops sneaked back to the city.

Zhao Qicai, commander of the eight militiamen in the third district of Xia County, was active in Miaocun, Xia County, on August 30th. They were once surrounded by Chiang's army in a courtyard. Intelligence officer Xing Yunsheng was the first to rush out and was shot in a vital part and fell in a pool of blood. He also threw five grenades and shouted: "I would rather die than surrender my gun!" Zhao Qicai knew that the hope of rushing out from the gate was cut off. "Are we waiting to surrender?" Zhao Qicai asked the militiamen. "Damn it, no one can surrender!" the militiamen replied strongly. "Okay! Don't surrender, follow me resolutely, we will rush out of the wall with grenades." Just as the eight of them jumped down the wall, they shouted, "I'm out!" This shout frightened Chiang's army who were aiming at them.

Chiang's army was more brutal than the Japanese invaders in the occupied areas, committing rape and arson. In Tanghui, Xia County, they only stayed for one night and killed Mao Caicai's family, slaughtered fourteen cattle, and robbed all other property. A wealthy farmer in Qiucun, Wenxi, had his feudal exploitation cleared by the farmers during the land reform. Therefore, he welcomed Chiang's army to help "restore the old order," but he was very disappointed. As soon as Chiang's army arrived, they first arrested him and took him to the city to do hard labor. A flour mill and twenty pigs, all the tools sufficient for developing production, which were left for him during the land reform in the liberated areas, were all looted by Chiang's army. His daughter was also raped by Chiang's army. Finally, he escaped from the city, feeling disappointed and empty. He stamped his feet and sighed and went to the Eighth Route Army and said: "Saving grandpa, please help us quickly and save us from the fire pit!..." Due to the ravages of Chiang's army, more than 500 landlords and rich peasants who fled from the occupied areas have been rescued by the democratic government. In these three long months, the democratic government has never left the people in order to protect the interests of the people.

Chiang's army's attacks have spread to the foothills of the Zhongtiao Mountains. Chiang's army's looting of grain angered farmer Fan Qihou. He took out the gun he had hidden and called on the militia of Xigou to organize a guerrilla team, which defeated Chiang's army who were looting grain. Du Yaosheng, the district chief of the third district of Wenxi, led the militia to fight Chiang's army four times in one day. In the last battle, the militia was dispersed, but he still insisted on the Tiewuyu position alone. They have all become models for persisting in democratic power in the Chiang's army occupied areas, and are praised by the people. The democratic government can not only persist in the face of Chiang's army's offensive, but also penetrate deeper into the rear of Chiang's army and destroy the political power established by Chiang's army, so that Chiang's army loses its control in the occupied areas and cannot obtain supplies and support.

When Chiang's army launched a large-scale offensive towards Linfen and Fushan in September, the army and people of Southern Shanxi became active in the rear of Chiang's army, which was empty. The local corps and militia guerrillas recovered 26,000 square miles of land. They took the initiative to fight Chiang's army more than 580 times, averaging more than six battles per day. They recovered hundreds of villages and towns such as Songjiazhuang, Yanzhang, Peijie, Yuwangcheng, Wangzhao, Podi, and Cuijiahe. The vast guerrilla corps approached the suburbs of Wenxi and Xia along the Tongpu Railway. If you ask the secret of the victory of the army and people of Southern Shanxi, it is that the broad masses of the people love their land, love their motherland, fully support the front line, and the extraordinary heroic activities of the Eighth Route Army, guerrillas, and militia, and resolutely form a comprehensive resistance front. In the near future, we will see the great victory of the people of Southern Shanxi recovering all their lost land.

    战争试炼了晋南人民
    何微
    七月三日，蒋介石以四十七师、七十八师、三十一师、一六七师、七十二师五个师的兵力，直接威胁晋南人民的生存。八路军一面沉着抵抗，一面诱蒋军深入，以消灭他们的有生力量。战争进行到十二日，蒋军以飞机坦克掩护陆军，以重大牺牲换取了水头、堰掌、胡张、郭店、闻喜等四百六十余处解放区村镇。占领的时间仅仅十天，十三日，八路军在十数万人民支援之下，开始反击。在堰掌、如意上晁、宋店三次猛烈的战斗中，歼灭了蒋军三十一师、一六七师及七十八师一部，共三千五百余人。解放区军民的英勇和团结，完全粉碎了蒋介石军占领晋南的计划。十六日，蒋军又不能不从占领的土地上滚出去。八月中旬，蒋介石从河南、陕西又重新集结大兵，包括嫡系六个旅（其中三个美械旅），西北军三个旅，约七万人，可谓“倾巢出犯”。东沿中条山麓，西靠稷王山麓，中依同蒲铁路，他们想将八路军向中条山压去。特别在八月二十七日，蒋军侵入绛县、垣曲公路以后，看来形势显然更为恶化。晋南三十万军民，已被蒋军封销在三角地带，从此至九月二十五日，蒋军又在中条山区三次“清剿”。但是任何的力量都不能迫使人民在敌人面前屈服。人民已顽强地生活在新的斗争里。广大的游击队，以闻所未闻的姿态，走下山角，进至晋南平原。九月六日，游击队得到当地民兵的配合，同时攻击平陆、茅津渡、太阳渡、圣人涧、大臣五处蒋军据点，收复了黄河重要渡口茅津渡。完全消灭了太阳渡的蒋军守备部队。迫使蒋军不得不把部队由山地缩回去，加强据点守备。
    夏县任克良的民兵游击队，到处破坏蒋军的通讯联络，拆毁了蒋军的电线。驻枣园的蒋军通讯排，奉命架设夏县至胡张、胡张至崔家河的两条有线电话，当从夏县架设至胡张时，夏县一段已被任克良的游击队割去。胡张架设到崔家河，胡张一段又被割去。蒋家通讯排长，受到上级的申斥，跑到枣园村外，隐声哭泣，咒骂游击队。蒋军把电线埋在土中，免强架设起来，到晚又被游击队割去了。最后，蒋军采用日寇“肉电杆”的办法，每一根电杆抓一个民夫看守。但等游击队来了，他们却和游击队一起把电线割去了。
    蒋军受到游击队的巨大威胁，其派遣至郭镇的警戒部队，连续四天受到游击队的袭击。他们打了一个报告给九十一团团长，恳求说：“这个地方不断为游击队袭击，损失严重。我们可以移回城里驻扎。八月十八日这股蒋军就偷偷溜回城里去了。
    夏县三区赵起才指挥的八个民兵。八月三十日，活动至夏县苗村，曾被蒋军包围在一处院子里，情报干事邢云生，首先冲出，即被击中要害倒在血泊中，他还投了五个手榴弹，并高呼：“我死也不能缴枪！”赵起才知道从大门冲出的希望是断绝了，“我们等着缴枪吗？”赵起才对民兵发出疑问。“妈的，谁都不能缴枪！”民兵粗壮的回答：“好！不缴枪，坚决跟我走，我们用手榴弹从墙上冲出去。”当他们八个人刚跳下墙，大喊一声：“老子出来了！”这一声叫喊，反把正对准他们射击的蒋军吓怔了。
    蒋军在侵占区内，奸淫烧杀比日本人还要残暴。在夏县唐回仅住过一夜，就杀死农民毛才才一家，宰杀牛十四头，其他财物抢劫一空。闻喜邱村某富农，在土地改革中，农民们曾经清算过他的封建剥削部分，所以他欢迎蒋军来帮助“光复旧业”，但他很失望，蒋军一到就先将他抓进城里去做苦工。在解放区土地改革时，为他留的一座粉坊，二十只猪，足够发展生产的全部工具，都被蒋军抢光了。他的姑娘也被蒋军奸淫。最后他从城里逃出来，感到失望的空虚。顿足叹气去找八路军说：“救命爷爷，赶快帮个忙，把我们从火坑里救出来吧！……”由于蒋军的蹂躏，从侵占区逃出的地主、富农等已有五百余人，民主政府都予以救济。在这三个悠长的月份中，为保护人民的利益，民主政府从未离开过人民。
    蒋军的攻击，已蔓延至中条山麓，蒋军的抢粮激怒了农民范其后，他把藏的枪拿出来，号召西沟民兵，组织了游击队，打垮了抢粮蒋军。闻喜三区区长杜耀生，带领民兵，在一天中与蒋军四次作战，最后一次民兵被冲散了，他仍一个人坚持铁午峪阵地。他们都成为在蒋军侵占区坚持民主政权的模范，被人民歌颂着。民主政权不但在蒋军进攻中能够坚持，而且更深入蒋军后方，把蒋军建立起来的政权摧毁。使蒋军在占领区失去了统驭力，得不到补给和支援。
    当蒋军九月向临（汾）浮（山）大举进犯的时候，晋南军民在蒋军空虚的后方，活跃起来。地方兵团和游击队民兵收复了二万六千平方华里的土地。主动与蒋军作战五百八十余次，平均每日作战六次之多。收复了宋家庄、堰掌、裴介、禹王城、王赵、坡底、崔家河等数百个村镇。广大的游击兵团，逼进同蒲沿线的闻、夏城郊。如问晋南军民能够胜利的秘密，那就是广大人民热爱自己的土地，热爱祖国，全力支援前线，和八路军、游击队、民兵卓绝的英勇活动，坚决结成一条全面抵抗的战线，不久的将来，我们会看见晋南人民恢复全部失地的伟大胜利。
