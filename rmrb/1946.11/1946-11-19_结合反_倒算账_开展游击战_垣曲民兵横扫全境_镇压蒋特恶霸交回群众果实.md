(This report from Taiyue, 18th) The people of Yuanqu, who had experienced the "Sixty Catty Anti-Collection" movement and "Political Siege," have been unified under the leadership of the County Command since August 27th, when Chiang Kai-shek's troops occupied the county. The 40,000 people who were transferred from the Chiang-occupied area are now carrying out guerrilla warfare everywhere, inflicting serious blows on the invading Chiang Kai-shek troops and the treacherous bullies and secret agents who are forcibly carrying out the "Reversal of Settlements." According to incomplete statistics from September and October, the county's militia fought 181 battles, killing or wounding 50 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers, capturing 3 alive, killing or capturing 30 armed secret agents, and destroying 12 Chiang Kai-shek bunkers. In those two months, only four of our people were injured. When Chiang Kai-shek's troops advanced towards Yuanqu city on August 26th, six militiamen from a village in the Second District confronted Chiang Kai-shek's troops in the village for a day, delaying their advance. On September 9th, the First District militia even launched a three-pronged attack, sweeping the 15-mile bunker line between Gaoluo and Shitou Geta held by Chiang Kai-shek's troops, destroying nine bunkers in Yujiapo, Longwangyan, Xipo, Jiaoxie and other places, and harvesting 30 miles of power lines between Gaoluo and Wangwu. The guerrilla warfare in Yuanqu is closely linked to the masses' anti-bully "Reversal of Settlements." The militia guerrillas have won the support of the broad masses. At the cost of only four light injuries in two months, they have achieved significant victories. Chang Shoushan, the deputy head of the "Revenge Team" of Chiang Kai-shek agents in Shangwang Village, and Cao Jinrong, a major bully, relied on the power of the Chiang Kai-shek troops in the Gaoluo stronghold to forcibly carry out the "Reversal of Settlements" everywhere, forcibly taking back more than 30 dan of grain and eight pigs, the legitimate fruits of the emancipated masses. They also set up a large oil pot on the street of Gaoluo, threatening the masses, saying: "Go to the oil pot to emancipate yourselves." They also said: "A blink of my eye is a lightning flash, and a sneeze of mine will cause a dragon to rise and a great flood to occur!" Greatly threatening the masses. On September 26th, our Second District militia mobilized to surround the Gaoluo stronghold, reaching the residence of the bully and Chiang Kai-shek agent Cao Jinrong. They killed Cao Jinrong and Chang Shoushan, who resisted arrest, on the spot. Chiang Kai-shek's troops came out of the fort to rescue Cao, but were defeated by our pre-arranged militia. After resolutely suppressing the bad guys who led the "Reversal of Settlements," the guerrillas returned the fruits to the masses. The masses were greatly encouraged, and the development of the mass guerrilla war became even more vigorous.
