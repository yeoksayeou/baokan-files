　　Fenyang Xiaoyi Militia
    Vigorously Attack Chiang's Troops Seizing Grain
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 5th] The Fenyang and Xiaoyi militias vigorously attacked the Yan puppet troops who were seizing grain and conscripting men. A part of the 208th Regiment of the Yan Army in Fenyang and more than 600 armed villagers surrounded Baikepo, 25 li northwest of Fenyang, at dawn on the 21st of last month to arrest young men. The militia immediately launched an attack, and after a day of fierce fighting, killed more than ten enemies. On the 22nd of last month, hundreds of Yan soldiers from Xiehe Fort, ten li west of Fenyang City, went to Xiangzitan area to seize grain. As soon as they reached the entrance of Xiangziyuan Village, they stepped on a landmine, killing and wounding four people. Under the constant harassment of the militia day and night, the Yan army retreated to Xiehe Fort in panic on the 30th.
