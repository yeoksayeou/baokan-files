　　Please Cherish People's Strength!
　　Recently, due to the impact of the war, the transfer of supplies, the relocation of organizations, the transportation of ammunition, and the accumulation of public grain, many organizations and troops have genuinely understood the difficulties of the people. When the use of people's strength was absolutely necessary, they used it as little as possible and paid according to regulations. However, there are also individual organizations, troops, individuals, or groups who, under the guise of hiring labor, actually requisition labor without even paying the labor price, leaving the people hungry and forcing them to transport goods. What was originally said to be three or four days turned into seven or eight days without being allowed to return. Sometimes the requisition isn't for transporting important supplies, but for moving broken tables and rotten benches. The estimated cost of the labor is several times higher than the price of the broken tables. What could have been done with a few laborers ends up requiring dozens, because when the request comes from the prefectural commissioner's office, they ask for a small number, but by the time it gets to the county and district, they ask for several times more. The reason is not just to transport things, but also to provide seats for people, and comfortable ones at that. Some even move bad grain that can't even be used for feeding pigs or making liquor back and forth, thus wasting the people's strength. It is reported that in some places, the people haven't even planted their wheat yet. This deserves everyone's attention.
　　For the victory of the war, it is right and necessary for the people to contribute all their financial, material, and human resources. However, we must also recognize that the self-defense war is a long-term one. When using people's strength, we should calculate everything carefully, save where we can save, and avoid using it when it's unnecessary. We must also recognize that people's wealth is finite, and people's strength is limited. If too much is wasted, it will increase the difficulty of winning the war!
　　Currently, the burden on the people's strength is too heavy. In some individual places, it has even been discovered that a family of five, with one donkey and one laborer, spent only 19 days at home and 21 days performing labor duties within a period of 40 days. If this continues, how can they support a long-term war! I, on behalf of the masses, urgently appeal: Please cherish people's strength!

　  请爱惜民力！
    最近一个时期，由于战争影响，物资转移，机关搬动，弹药运输，公粮集积，不少机关部队，是真能体贴民艰，非用民力不可时，亦尽少而用，按手续支拨；但也有个别机关部队、个人或团体，假代雇之名，行支差之实，甚至差价也不发，让老百姓人饥马饿，强迫载运；原说三四天，七八天也不放回，有的要差，不是拉重要物资，而是拉破桌子烂板凳，估计民力脚价，比破桌子价高几倍，有些原可几个差就行，定要几十个差，在行署专署要的少，到了县区，就多要几倍，原因是不只拉东西，还要坐人，而且还要坐的舒适：甚至将喂猪烧酒都不能用的坏粮食搬来搬去，因而浪费了民力。据报有的地方老百姓麦子都没种上，这是值得大家注意的。
    为了战争胜利，人民贡献一切财力物力人力，原是应该而且必须的；但是我们也必须认识自卫战争是长期的，使用民力，就该处处计算，该节省的节省，可不用时就不用，更须认识到民财有尽，民力有限，如浪费过多对于争取战争胜利会增加困难！
    目前民力负担太重了，甚至个别地方竟发现一个老百姓，大小五口，一头毛驴，一个劳力，四十天内，十九天在家，二十一天支了差，如此下去，又如何能支持长期的战争呢！我代表群众疾呼，请爱惜民力！
