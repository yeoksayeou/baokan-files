　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 30th. New York dispatch: Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov delivered his first speech at the United Nations General Assembly yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM (New York time). Molotov spoke in Russian in the crowded conference hall. When discussing the issue of foreign troops stationed abroad, Molotov described the stationing of foreign troops within the territory of certain countries as a very obstructive factor in international relations, and the Security Council should have the right to investigate the stationing of troops by a member of the United Nations within the territory of another member state. He also said, "The Security Council made a major mistake in handling the Franco Spain issue," and "This mistake must now be corrected." Molotov spoke on the sixth day of the General Assembly. It is estimated that the general debate of the General Assembly will continue until November 1st, and the activities of the subcommittees will begin on November 1st.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 30th. New York dispatch: On the fifth day of the United Nations General Assembly (28th), the representatives of Egypt, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Belarus, New Zealand, and Gu Weijun, the representative of the Kuomintang, delivered speeches in succession. Haqqi Karar, the chief representative of Egypt, requested the General Assembly to state that "the General Assembly disagrees with foreign troops remaining in foreign countries in violation of the freedom of the people of other sovereign countries to express their will." Mr. Haqqi Karar requested the General Assembly to record the fact that when one sovereign country exerts pressure on another country by openly stationing troops or maintaining troops, all negotiations are invalid. Mr. Haqqi Karar asserted that the retention of foreign troops on the territory of certain sovereign countries is the result of the delay in establishing the United Nations armed forces. The representatives of Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Belarus all requested the General Assembly to pay attention to the situation in Spain and the danger of the Franco regime to world peace, freedom, and democracy. They also exposed the representatives who had previously attacked the veto power and condemned such attacks as contributing nothing to peace.

　　莫洛托夫呼吁联合国大会
    调查外军驻非敌国
    【新华社延安三十日电】纽约讯：苏外长莫洛托夫于昨日下午四时（纽约时间）在联合国大会上发表首次演说。莫氏于拥挤之会议厅中，以俄语发言。论及国外驻军问题时，莫洛托夫形容在某些国家境内驻扎外国军队，是国际关系中极有妨碍的因素，安理会应有调查联合国的某一会员国在另一会员国境内驻军权利。他又说：“安理会在处理佛朗哥西班牙问题上犯了重大错误”，“现在必须纠正这一错误”。莫洛托夫是在大会的第六日发言，估计大会各代表一般辩论将继续至十一月一日，十一月一日起即进入各小组委员会活动的阶段。
    【新华社延安三十日电】纽约讯：联合国大会的第五日（二十八日），埃及、捷克、波兰、白俄罗斯、新西兰的代表与国民党的代表顾维钧等相继发表演说。埃及首席代表黑格卡尔要求大会表明“大会不同意外国军队违反其他主权国人民自由表达其意志而留驻外国”，黑氏要求大会纪录以下的事实，即主权国家中之一国以公开或驻留军队之方法将压力加诸另一国时，所有谈判概为无效。黑氏断言外国军队留驻某些主权国领土上，是迟迟不建立联合国武装的结果。捷克、波兰、白俄罗斯的代表皆要求大会注意西班牙的情势及佛朗哥政权对世界和平自由与民主的危险，他们并对前此攻击否决权的代表们加以揭发，并申斥这种攻击对和平毫无贡献。
