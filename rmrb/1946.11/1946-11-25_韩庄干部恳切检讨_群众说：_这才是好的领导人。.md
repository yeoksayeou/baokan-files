　　Han Village Cadres Make Sincere Self-Criticism
    The Masses Say: "These are Good Leaders."
    [Our newspaper's dispatch from Wei County on the 22nd] The Fourth District Chief of Ji County patiently persuaded the cadres of Han Village, transforming mutual jealousy into unity. In mid-October, the masses in villages throughout the Fourth District of Ji County vigorously launched the struggle against traitors and for revenge, but Han Village remained lifeless. The Fourth District Chief spoke with many villagers to investigate the reasons and learned that the village cadres had serious hero worship, looked down on each other, handled everything on their own, and did not discuss matters with the masses. In particular, some of the fruits of the spring struggle had entered the private pockets of the village cadres. Moreover, due to unequal distribution, they were dissatisfied with each other and undermined each other's prestige among the masses. They worked independently, causing dissatisfaction among the masses. After understanding the situation, the District Chief first held individual talks with the village cadres, explaining the harm of disunity. After persuading some individual village cadres, he convened a meeting of village cadres to conduct class education, continuing with each person recalling the pain their families had suffered in the past and the reasons for the improvement in their political and economic status today, moving everyone to tears. When they spoke about the harm of selfishness and hero worship to themselves, it was even more poignant. After the cadres' thinking was straightened out, they immediately made heartfelt self-criticisms at a mass meeting and took out the privately stored wealth, allowing the masses to discuss it democratically and distribute it reasonably. The militia captain and the Farmers' Association director voluntarily gave up their share of the fruits of the struggle. The masses all said: "In recent years, the village cadres have not promoted democracy, but today they have all changed for the better and are still our good leaders!"

　　韩庄干部恳切检讨
    群众说：“这才是好的领导人。”
    【本报威县二十二日电】冀县四区区长耐心说服韩庄村干部，变互忌为团结。上月中旬，冀县四区各村群众都轰轰烈烈掀起反奸复仇斗争，独韩庄死气沉沉。四区区长便和许多群众谈话，调查原因，了解到该村村干部都有严重的英雄主义，互相瞧不起，遇事包办，不与群众讨论。特别是春季斗争的果实，有些入了村干私囊。并因分的不均，彼此不满。在群众中互相破坏威信。工作上各自为政，遭到群众不满。区长了解情况后，首先找村干进行个别谈话，说明不团结的害处，说服了个别村干后，又召集村干会进行阶级教育，续每个人回忆自己家庭以前所受的痛苦和今天政治、经济地位提高的原因，感动的每个人都难过流泪。当说到自私自利和英雄主义对自己的危害时，更为痛切。干部思想打通后，随即在群众会上都痛心的作了反省，并将私存的财物立刻拿出来，让群众民主讨论，合理分配。民兵队长、农会主任并自愿不分斗争果实。群众都说：“这些年来村干部们没有发扬民主，今天都变好了，还是我们的好领导人！”
