　　[Changzhi Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 4th] The main force of a regiment of Chiang Kai-shek's troops invading the liberated area north of Qinyang was mostly annihilated. On the morning of the 31st of last month, the entire 529th Regiment of the 177th Brigade of the 38th Division of Chiang's troops stationed in Qinyang advanced into the liberated area north of Qinyang, attempting to occupy the mountainous area north of the Qinyang River and west of the Dan River. When Chiang's troops entered the area of Wanshan and Shanwangzhuang, more than ten miles north of Qinyang, they were met with a powerful interception by our forces. After two hours of fierce fighting, the guerrilla warriors bravely launched a counter-offensive, compressing the enemy into the narrow area around Shanwangzhuang for encirclement and annihilation. By 3:00 PM, the invading Chiang's troops were unable to hold out and scattered in flight, disintegrating into a routed army. According to incomplete statistics, in this battle, more than a hundred Chiang's troops below the battalion commander level were killed, more than two hundred were wounded, and more than two hundred, including three deputy battalion commanders, were captured alive. Four mortars, six small cannons, seventeen light and heavy machine guns, and more than two hundred rifles were seized, as well as more than ten warhorses and countless ammunition and military supplies.
　　
　　[Yangcheng Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 4th] The Zhaocheng-Huoxian section of the Tongpu Railway has been severely threatened by militia demolition teams and is no longer passable. Chiang's military transport has been forced to detour west of the Fen River, and Chiang's troops trapped in isolated strongholds dare not venture out easily. The militia demolition team in the fifth district of Huoxian County laid mines seven times in the suburbs of Huoxian County and at Xinshi Station in five days, repeatedly inflicting damage on Chiang's troops. On October 18th, after the militia demolition team laid mines near Zhangjiabao, they fired at Chiang's troops to lure the enemy to pursue, triggering two landmines. Two of Chiang's troops were wounded. The next day, after a Chiang's transport team was ambushed at Xinzhi Beach, they fled in panic and entered a minefield. Thirteen cluster mines exploded simultaneously, scattering Chiang's troops' flesh and blood. A total of sixteen people were killed or wounded, and the remaining three hundred or so were utterly terrified and fled in all directions. From then on, Chiang's transport team had no choice but to detour west of the Fen River.

    【本报阳城四日电】同蒲线赵（城）霍（县）段遭受民兵爆炸队的严重威胁，已无法通行，蒋军交通运输被迫绕道汾河以西，困守孤立据点中的蒋军，亦不敢轻易外出。霍县五区的民兵爆炸队五天中在霍县城郊及辛置车站设雷七次，屡创蒋军。十月十八日，民兵爆炸队在张家堡附近埋雷后，即向蒋军射击，诱敌来追，踏响地雷两个。蒋军二人被炸伤。次日，蒋军运输队在辛置滩遭伏击后，仓惶逃跑，又进入雷区。十三个子母雷一齐爆炸，蒋军被炸得血肉横飞，共死伤十六人，其余的三百余人都落魂失魄，四处溃逃，从此蒋军的运输队就只好绕道汾河以西。
