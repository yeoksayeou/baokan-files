[Report from our Weixian Office on the 2nd] The leading organs of Xinhe County, in order to deeply develop the leveling and replenishment campaign, recently issued instructions to all districts. The contents are as follows: 1. In the unified distribution of fruits after the joint struggle, the cadres of Wang Gu Village guided the masses to promote class love, and transferred much land to the poor small villages to solve the land problems of the poor small villages, which is worthy of everyone's learning. However, the cadres of Yin Cai Village have localism and are unwilling to help the poor small village masses obtain land. Some village cadres even tried every means to avoid joint struggles. For this tendency, cadres above the district level must adhere to principles and patiently persuade village cadres and the masses. Before the fruits are gained through struggle, it is necessary to stipulate the method of distributing the fruits in the joint struggle to avoid temporary disputes and antagonism. It is best to achieve unified distribution of fruits and eliminate the extreme poverty of the united villages, and at least achieve unified distribution of land. Assets can be appropriately based on the main village. 2. The fruits of struggle from some villages last year have not yet been distributed (such as Jiao Tang and Zhengjiaji villages in the Fifth District); the fruit distribution in some villages is unfair (such as Zhengjiaji), with cadres getting more and members getting less, and even newly developed farmer members are not allowed to share; the farmer associations, women's associations, and militias in some villages are planting a lot of public temple land. The above phenomena are hindering the thorough realization of "land to the tiller" and should be corrected. 3. Some cadres in the Third District neglect to solve the land and housing problems of the families of soldiers resisting Japan during the struggle; this should be corrected immediately. 4. Some landlords and rich peasants falsely mortgage land in an attempt to disperse targets and evade burdens. The solution is that the land rights of landlords who falsely mortgage land should be transferred (confiscated) and handed over to the farmers' association for handling; for rich peasants who falsely mortgage land, land rights can also be transferred or partially transferred depending on the specific circumstances. Some can extend the mortgage period for more than five years without pursuing burdens or pursuing fewer burdens; for middle peasants who falsely mortgage land, the land rights will not be touched at all, nor will the burdens be pursued, and the mortgage period can be extended at their discretion on a voluntary basis; if they want to take it back for their own cultivation, mediation can also be used to solve it. If the mortgager is a middle peasant or above, they need to be persuaded to transfer all or part of the mortgage to the poor peasants. When transferring land rights or transferring the mortgage, the mortgage price shall be returned by the mortgagor to the original mortgagee, and the new mortgage price shall be publicly discussed by the masses. If the poor cannot afford it for a while, they can pay in installments.

　　新河指示各区注意果实分配
    照顾贫苦村深入填补
    地主假当假卖应转移地权归贫农
    【本报威县二日电】新河县领导机关，为深入开展填平补齐运动，顷向各区发出指示。内容为：一、王固庄干部在联合斗争后的统一分配果实中，引导群众发扬阶级友爱，把许多土地让给贫苦小村群众解决了贫苦小村土地问题，这是值得大家学习的。但尹才庄村干部却存在着村本位思想，不愿帮助贫苦小村群众获得土地。有的村干部甚至千方百计，避免联合斗争。对这种倾向，区以上干部必须坚持原则，耐心说服村干和群众。在未斗出果实前，要订好联合斗争中分配果实办法，避免临时闹纠纷，闹对立，最好作到果实统一分配，消灭联合各村的赤贫，最低也要作到土地统一分配，资财可酌量以主村为主。二、有些村庄去年的斗争果实至今未分（如五区焦堂、郑家集等村）；有些村果实分配不公（如郑家集），干部分的多，会员分得少，甚至不许新发展的农会员分；有些村庄的农、妇会，民兵都种着很多公庙地。上述这些现象，都障碍着彻底实现耕者有其田，应该纠正。三、三区干部有的忽视在斗争中解决抗属土地房屋问题；应即纠正。四、有些地主、富农假当地，企图分散目标，逃避负担。处理办法是地主假当地应转移地权（没收）交农会处理；富农假当地者，根据具体情况，亦可转移地权或转移一部。另一些可延长当期五年以上，不追负担或酌量少追负担；中农假当地，地权一概不动，也不追负担，可酌情在自愿原则下延长当期；如要收回自种亦可调解解决，如承当户是中农或中农以上成分，需说服其全部或部分转当给贫农。转移地权或转当时，当价由出当人归还原承当人，新当价由群众公议，如穷人一时出不起，可分期付款。
