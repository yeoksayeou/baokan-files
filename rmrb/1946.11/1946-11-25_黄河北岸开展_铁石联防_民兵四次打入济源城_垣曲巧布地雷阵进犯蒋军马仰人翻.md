　　Yellow River North Bank Launches "Iron and Stone Joint Defense"
    Militia Enters Jiyuan City Four Times
    Yuanqu Cleverly Plants Landmine Arrays, Invading Chiang Troops Overturned
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch of the 23rd] The masses in Yuanqu, Jiyuan and other counties along the Yellow River are using "iron and stone joint defense" to protect their homes. From the end of last month to the beginning of this month, the military and civilians of Jiyuan have attacked Jiyuan city four times. On the 27th of last month, our militia from districts one, two, three, four, and five, in coordination with local armed forces, attacked Jiyuan city from the east, west, and north. The enemy fled in panic from the south gate. After we captured eight special agents of the "Revenge Squad," we withdrew safely. Fearing our surprise attacks, the enemy hurriedly released the wife of the Farmers' Association director of Chengnan Street and the cattle they had captured. From the night of the 2nd of this month to dawn on the 3rd, the militia of the fifth district, in coordination with local armed forces, attacked Jiyuan city three times in a row, burned down a pillbox, and captured five special agents, and wounded another special agent near the city. On the night of the 30th of last month, the militia of the second and third districts of Jiyuan, in coordination with the Meng County Independent Battalion, attacked Nanguanzhuang in the second district of Jiyuan, and burned down all fifteen pillboxes of Chiang's troops. The × battalion of the 164th Regiment of the enemy and the special agent "Revenge Squad" fled in panic. On the 2nd of this month, the militia of the second district of Yuanqu laid four landmines on the Xixingma to Yuanqu city highway, three of which exploded. On the night of the 4th, they laid three landmine arrays with forty landmines on the west side of the Fengcun Bridge. On the 5th, Chiang's troops invaded our Magu Mountain and were met by local armed forces, forcing Chiang's troops to retreat into the Fengcun landmine array. For a time, the landmines exploded one after another, killing four Chiang soldiers and wounding six. At the same time, Chiang's troops went to Xixingma Village to loot, and one was wounded by stepping on a landmine. From the beginning of October to the beginning of this month in Yuanqu, the militia fought independently nineteen times, killing and wounding fourteen Chiang soldiers and capturing twenty-one personnel of the puppet district office.
