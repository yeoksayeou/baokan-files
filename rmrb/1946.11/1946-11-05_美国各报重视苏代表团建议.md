Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, November 1st: TASS New York special correspondent reported on October 31st: Stalin's answers to questions raised by the president of the Associated Press, Mr. Bailey, and Molotov's speech at the United Nations General Assembly, have occupied the primary position of all international events. After most American newspapers published Stalin's talk yesterday, today's newspapers published the full text of Molotov's speech, and even the newspapers of various agencies that are conducting a systematic anti-Soviet movement have had to reprint Molotov's proposals in a prominent position. These proposals have undoubtedly produced a major impression on American public opinion. Before the thunderous applause in the General Assembly Hall had stopped, some representatives rushed to the lounge to issue statements to the press, in an attempt to reduce the credibility of the Soviet proposals. In particular, British, Dutch, and some other representatives made such statements. US Representative Connally said to the press in an excited tone: "Molotov, Molotov, why do you always ask about Molotov? Why don't you ask me about something else?" The Soviet delegation's proposals confirm its concern for universal peace and the security of all countries in the world. Today, comments from ordinary American journalists on Molotov's speech were heard as follows: "We should have peace and a good life." American newspapers published many comments from important figures from all walks of life recognizing the importance of the Soviet proposals. The US Permanent Representative to the UN Security Council, Austin, declared that Molotov's speech was "severely worded" and acknowledged that "it contains constructive suggestions that may prove to be the basis for a unanimous agreement to take resolute action in the interests of peace and security." The New York Herald Tribune, in an editorial, linked Stalin's talk and Molotov's speech, pointing out that Molotov put forward "overriding proposals, and are of such a broad scope that they force a revision of all issues in the world." The newspaper wrote: "It is now imperative that the Western powers do everything possible to keep pace with them and seek a broader basis for establishing relations." Many local newspapers' comments on Stalin's talk and Molotov's speech are also excellent. The Omaha World-Herald believes that the United States must establish cooperation with the Soviet Union. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette praised Stalin's talk. It can be known with certainty that those propaganda agencies that carry out anti-Soviet propaganda will meet the Soviet proposals with bayonets after their first moment of embarrassment clears. A fierce struggle is being waged over these proposals, both inside and outside the United Nations General Assembly. However, even now it can be said that these proposals are giving a fatal blow to various attempts to undermine the solidarity of the United Nations.

　　美国各报重视苏代表团建议
    【新华社延安一日电】塔斯社纽约特派记者十月三十一日报导：斯大林对合众社社长白理所提问题的答复与莫洛托夫在联合国组织大会上的讲演，已占取一切国际事变的首要地位。美国大部报纸，昨日刊载了斯大林谈话之后，今日各报又登出了莫洛托夫演讲全文，甚至进行系统反苏运动的各机关报，亦不得不以显著地位转载莫洛托夫的建议。这建议无疑对美国社会舆论产生了重大印象，在大会会议厅内雷动的掌声尚未停止时，某些代表即急趋休息室内向报界发表声明，以图减低苏方建议的威信，特别是英荷及某些其他代表，都作了这种声明。美代表康纳利以激动的口吻对报界说：“莫洛托夫，莫洛托夫，你们为什么老问到莫洛托夫呢？问我一些别的事情好不好？”苏代表团的建议，是证实其关心普遍和平与世界各国安全的。今天听到普遍美国记者对莫洛托夫讲演的评论如下：“我们应该有和平与良好的生活。”美国报纸刊载许多认识苏联建议重要性的各界要人的评论，美国驻联合国安理会常任代表奥斯丁宣称：莫洛托夫的讲演，是“声明的峻烈的”，并承认“其中包含建设性的建议，这些建议可能证明为对和平与安全利益，采取坚决行动之一致协议的基础”。纽约先驱论坛报在社论中将斯大林谈话与莫洛托夫演讲，连在一起，指出莫洛托夫提出了“凌驾一切的建议，并且是具有如此广阔的范围，以致迫使修改世界上的一切问题”。该报写道：“西方列强的职责，是竭尽一切可能与他们步调一致，并觅求确定关系的更广阔的基础，这已是紧要的了。”许多地方报纸关于斯大林谈话与莫洛托夫演讲的评论，也是出色的。奥马哈出版的世界先驱报，相信美国必须建立对苏合作。匹兹堡出版之邮报赞扬斯大林谈话。人们可以确知那些进行反苏宣传的机关报，在第一次窘态清醒之后，将以刺刀与苏联建议相见。在联合国大会会议内外，关于这些建议进行凶猛的斗争。然而人们即是现在也可以说这些建议是给予动摇联合国团结一致的各种企图，以致命打击。
