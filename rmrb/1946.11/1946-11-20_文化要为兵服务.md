    This edition publishes Comrade Lu Zhimo's letter, which very specifically tells us the needs of the frontline soldiers. How to meet these needs is a very important issue. We hope everyone will study it, and implement any good ideas as soon as possible.

    As for us, we would like to offer some opinions specifically on the supply of spiritual food. Comrade Lu pointed out in his letter that frontline soldiers urgently need easy-to-understand books and pictorials, want to hear clapper talk and folk tunes, and want to see dramas and Yangko dances. Recently, Chairman Yang returned from the front and specifically said: "The wounded soldiers cannot find books to read, and their spirits cannot be further relaxed"; the Border Region Government's Education Department is also soliciting books and newspapers for the front (please refer to the advertisement on page 4 of this newspaper on the 15th). We hope that the vast number of readers and people from all walks of life will actively and in an organized manner participate in this movement, find some themselves, and mobilize others to find some books, newspapers, pictures, and the like, and send them to the front as soon as possible.

    But this letter also raises the issue of how book and newspaper support for the army should consider how to achieve the purpose of "serving the soldiers." That means that the books and newspapers sent should be suitable for the soldiers' cultural level and related to their combat life, so that they can be pleasing to the eye and get satisfaction. It is not easy to do this. On the one hand, we agree with the Education Department's approach that anything can be sent as long as it is not obscene or heretical books, so as to avoid blocking the torrent of books and newspapers rushing to the front; on the other hand, we demand more actively opening up new sources. We solemnly call on the literary writers and all cultural workers in the border area to treat "serving the soldiers" as the most important work at present, and do their best to produce some popular and easy-to-understand works that may win the love of the soldiers, in order to meet the needs of the front.

    For example, soldiers like to listen to clapper talk, so why don't poets and clapper talkers write more? Soldiers like to listen to battlefield folk tunes, so why don't musicians come and compose some? Large pictorials can be changed into single sheets, and novels and stories can also be published in small booklets; playwrights should quickly create some frontline Yangko short plays; artists should hurry up and plan some color woodcut postcards, comic strips, and the like.... If you say "life is not enough," it is best to go to the front to see. Today is the time for art to serve the needs of the war of self-defense. Being able to "serve the soldiers" and serving them well is the glory of cultural workers.

专栏：

    文化要为兵服务
    曦
    本版今日刊载了鲁之沫同志的来信，很具体地告诉了我们前线战士的需要。怎样去满足这些需要，是一个很重要的问题，我们希望大家来研究，一有好的办法，就赶快实行起来。
    至于我们，愿意专就精神食粮的供应问题提点意见。鲁同志的信中、指出前线战士们迫切需要好懂的图书、画报，要听快板小调，要看戏剧秧歌。最近杨主席从前线回来，也特意说到：“伤员们看书而不得，精神上不能更加轻松”；边府教育厅也已经在为前方征求书报，（请参看本报十五日四版的广告）希望广大的读者和各界人士能踊跃地有组织地参加这个运动，自己找一些，并动员别人找一些书报画片之类，尽快寄向前方去。
    但这封信中更提出了书报劳军要考虑如何达到“为兵服务”的目的，那意思就是说，寄去的书报要适合战士们的文化程度，联系到他们的战斗生活，才能使他们喜闻乐见，得到满足。要作到一点，却就不大容易。我们一方面同意教育厅的办法，只要不是诲淫邪书之类都可以寄去，这样免得阻塞了奔向前方的书报洪流；另一方面我们却要求更积极地开源。谨号召边区的文艺作家和一切文化工作者，大家都来把“为兵服务”当作目前第一等重要的工作，尽其所能来产生一些通俗易懂并可能博得战士们喜爱的作品出来，以满足前方的需要。
    比如说战士们爱听快板，诗人们、板人们何不多来写些？战士们爱听战场小调，音乐家何不前来谱谱？大本画报无妨改作单张，小说故事也可出成小本；剧作家快来创作点前线秧歌短剧；美术家赶忙计划些套色木刻明信片、连环画之类……。如说“生活不够”，最好前线走走。今天是艺术服从自卫战争需要的时候了，能够“为兵服务”，而且服务得好，才是文化工作者的光荣。
