　　District Chief Qin of Floating Mountain First District Adheres to Post, Transfers to Suburban Warfare
    Taiyue Second Special District Office Issues Circular of Commendation
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch on the 22nd] Comrade Qin Zongtang, District Chief of the First District of Fushan, since the Chiang Kai-shek troops invaded Fushan, has led the people and militia of the entire district in launching guerrilla and bombing campaigns against the Chiang Kai-shek troops occupying Fushan on Tiantan Mountain, five li from the city. He frequently appears in villages such as Dong Erli and Wu Jiapo, two li from the city, to strike at Chiang and puppet activities. Although the Chiang Kai-shek troops have occupied Fushan for more than a month, under the active leadership of District Chief Qin, the political power in twelve out of the fifteen neighborhoods in the city and in villages such as Zhongcun and Xinluo along the Qilu highway west of the city still adhere to democratic laws and decrees. Therefore, our Second Special District Office issued a circular of commendation on the 11th, and instructed all counties and districts to launch discussions, review individual corrupting thoughts such as terror and laxity, and learn from District Chief Qin's fine style of hard struggle and adherence to his post.

　　浮山一区秦区长坚持岗位转战城郊
    太岳二专署通令表扬
    【本报太岳二十二日电】浮山一区区长秦宗汤同志，自蒋军侵占浮山后，即领导全区人民及民兵，在离城五里之天坛山，对进占浮山蒋军展开游击爆炸运动。经常出没于离城二里之东二里与吴家坡等村，打击蒋伪活动。蒋军虽占浮山月余，但在秦区长积极活动下，城关十五个闾之中的十二个闾，城西汽路上之中村与新落等村政权，仍旧坚持奉行民主法令。因此我二专署特于十一日通令表扬，并指示各县区展开讨论，检讨个人恐怖松懈等腐化思想，学习秦区长艰苦奋斗、坚持岗位的优良作风。
