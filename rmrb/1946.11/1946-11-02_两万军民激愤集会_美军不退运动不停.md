    20,000 Soldiers and Civilians Gather in Angry Rally
    U.S. Troops Must Withdraw, the Movement Will Not Stop
    [Our Paper] Taiyue [Mountain] Dispatch, 29th – On the final day of the U.S. Troops Out of China Movement Week – the 27th, the Taiyue military and civilians held a 20,000-person rally at the Yangcheng Martyrs' Cemetery. Over the past week, the masses' growing anti-U.S. aggression and anti-Chiang Kai-shek traitorous sentiments have reached a peak at this point. The chairman – Mr. Cui Douchun, a veteran educator from Southern Shanxi – announced the significance of the meeting. Then, Li Zheren, the Propaganda Minister of the CCP Taiyue District Committee, was invited to speak. He began powerfully by saying: "Chiang Kai-shek has sold out our country's ten major sovereign rights to the United States. This is the behavior of a traitor and a national scum, just like the traitor Wang Jingwei. The U.S. policy towards China is to colonize China, which is the same as the fascist aggression of Japan. Today's 'Chiang-America' is replacing the past 'Japan-Wang'. Therefore, we must resolutely oppose Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous act of selling out the motherland, surrendering, and waging civil war. We must expose and oppose the U.S. imperialist plot and actions to destroy China. We must warn the reactionary Chiang-America faction: Our three million people in the Taiyue District are determined not to be slaves of a fallen nation. If Chiang Kai-shek does not stop his dictatorship and civil war for one day, we will not stop resisting for one day! If U.S. imperialism does not stop its aid-Chiang policy and does not withdraw its naval, land, and air forces stationed in China for one day, we will not stop the anti-U.S. imperialist aggression movement for one day!" (The audience shouted: "U.S. troops out, the movement will not stop!") Comrade Zheren continued: We, the people of the liberated areas, have never been easy to bully. In the past three months, we have annihilated nearly thirty brigades (originally divisions) of Chiang's army. The so-called "No. 1 Army in the World" and many other elite troops of Hu Zongnan have been defeated by the iron fists of our military and civilians. This is a vivid illustration that we can defeat the enemy. Finally, Comrade Zheren called on all party, government, military, and civilians in the district to immediately and urgently mobilize, to make life wartime-oriented, to make work wartime-oriented, to focus on long-term considerations in all work, and especially to continue to implement and guarantee the rapid realization of the three major tasks of military training, production, and the implementation of 'land to the tiller,' so as to enrich the source and foundation of manpower and material resources for the patriotic self-defense war. After a speech by Mr. Gao Yanliu, a veteran educator from Henan, Wu Yuan, a representative of the people of Yangcheng, waved his fist and said: "We have tasted the eight years of the Japanese, and the suffering of being slaves of a fallen nation is unbearable. Now the United States is coming again to make us slaves of a fallen nation, which is something we cannot tolerate even in death." (The audience shouted, "We swear not to be slaves of a fallen nation!") Finally, he said angrily: "I represent the 210,000 people of Yangcheng to tell these bastards that we are irreconcilable with them. We must be bold and daring! Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, Yangcheng must be ours, and China must be ours!" Finally, Comrade Chai Zhengmin, the political commissar of the Third Sub-district, who had just returned from the enemy's rear, was invited to speak. He told how the military and civilians of the Third Sub-district had persisted in guerrilla warfare, recovered vast territories, and greatly encouraged people's confidence in victory. In the evening, there was a torchlight parade. In the evening, the Xiaoguang Theater Troupe and the Third Sub-district Theater Troupe performed "Hatred of Land Seizure" and "Wu Sangui Lets the Wolf into the House."

　　两万军民激愤集会
    美军不退运动不停
    【本报太岳二十九日电】美军退出中国运动周最后一日——二十七日，太岳军民假阳城烈士陵园召开两万人大会。一周来，群众逐渐增长的反美侵略、反蒋卖国激昂情绪，至此达到了一个顶点。主席——晋南老教育家崔斗辰先生宣布开会意义后，中共太岳区党委宣传部长李哲人同志继即被邀讲话，他开首即有力的说：“蒋介石出卖了我国十大主权送给美国，这是汉奸卖国贼的行为，和汉奸汪精卫一样。美国对华政策要殖民地化中国，这是和日本法西斯一样的侵略行为。今天的“美蒋”，就是代替了过去的“日汪”。因此，我们就要坚决反对蒋介石出卖祖国投降内战的汉奸行为，就要揭穿与反对美帝国主义灭亡中国的阴谋和行动。我们要警告蒋美反动派说：我们太岳区三百万人民是誓死不做亡国奴的，如果蒋介石一日不停止独裁与内战，我们就一日不停止抵抗！美帝国主义一日不停止援蒋政策，不撤退驻华之海陆空军，我们就一日不停止反对美帝国主义的侵略运动！”（台下高呼：美军不退，运动不停！）哲人同志继称：我们解放区人民从来就不是好惹的，最近三个月来，我们消灭了蒋军将近三十个旅（原师），号称“天下第一军”及胡宗南的其他许多劲旅，都在我区军民的铁拳下溃灭了，这就是我们可以战胜敌人的生动的说明。最后，哲人同志号召全区党政军民要立即紧急动员起来，生活战时化，工作战时化，一切工作要长期着眼，特别是要继续贯彻和保证练兵、生产、实行耕者有其田三大任务的迅速实现，以充实爱国自卫战争人力物力的来源和基础。河南老教育家高延柳先生讲话后，阳城人民代表五源挥动着拳头说：“我们尝了日本人的八年滋味，亡国奴的痛苦是不好受的。现在美国又来让我们当亡国奴，这是死也不能忍受的。（台下高呼“我们誓死不当亡国奴！”）最后他激愤的说：“我代表阳城廿一万人民告诉他们这些王八蛋，我们和他们是不共戴天的，我们要放大胆的干！在毛主席领导下，阳城一定是我们的，中国一定是我们的”。最后被邀请讲话的是新从敌后回来的三分区政委柴整民同志，他告诉了三分区的军民坚持了游击战争，恢复了广大土地，大大鼓舞了人们的胜利信心。入夜火炬游行。晚间由晓光剧团与三分区剧团公演“夺地恨”“吴三桂引狼入室。”
