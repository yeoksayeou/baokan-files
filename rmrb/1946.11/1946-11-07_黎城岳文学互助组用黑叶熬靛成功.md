　　The Yue Literary Mutual Aid Group in Licheng Successfully Boils Indigo from Black Leaf
　　[This newspaper, Licheng News] The Yue Literary Mutual Aid Group in Huangcaoshan Village, Fifth District of Licheng, successfully boiled indigo from black leaf dogbane during production breaks. They cut the leaves and branches of the black leaf dogbane into one-inch lengths with a chaff cutter. For every thirty catties, they used four buckets of clean water and boiled it in a pot until it became a semi-colloidal liquid. Every three pots of this semi-colloidal liquid can be boiled into ten catties of black indigo. The heat for boiling the indigo is right when it forms a bead when dropped into clear water. Each catty of black leaf indigo can dye sixteen yards of cloth, three zhang. When using, one catty of indigo is boiled evenly in water with nine taels of black alum (it is better to use crude alkali), then the cloth is put in and boiled for twenty minutes. Tests show that the dyed black cloth is better than foreign products such as Da Yong, Qingcao, Tiding, and Sisters brands, and the color never fades. Black leaf dogbane is found all over the mountainous areas of Licheng. If it is boiled in large quantities, it will solve the dye problem for the nearby three or four counties. At the same time, it can resist foreign indigo. It is reported that the Yue Literary Mutual Aid Group earned 30,000 yuan by boiling this indigo, and they are currently preparing to boil it in large quantities. (Yulin, Jincai)

　　黎城岳文学互助组用黑叶熬靛成功
    【本报黎城讯】黎城五区黄草山村岳文学互助组，在生产空隙中利用黑叶柴熬靛成功。他们将黑叶柴的叶枝割下，用铡刀铡成一寸来长，每三十斤用清水四桶，在锅内熬煮，熬成半胶状液。这种半胶状液，每三锅能熬成十斤黑靛。熬成靛的火候，以滴在清水里成珠就成了。每斤黑叶靛能染十六码布三丈。用时一斤靛用九两黑矾（换用臭碱更好）在水内煮匀，再放下布煮二十分钟即成。经试验染成的黑布比大甬、青草、提灯、姐妹牌等外来品都好，永不落色。按黑叶柴在黎城靠山一带都有，如大量熬制，将解决附近三、四县的染料问题。同时亦可抵制外靛。闻岳文学互助组因熬此靛赚洋三万元，目前正预备大量熬制中。（玉林、进才）
