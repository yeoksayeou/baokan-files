　　Just as Chiang Kai-shek was attacking Yan'an, convening an illegal "National Assembly," and attempting to invade Daming, Handan, and Xingtai, our People's Liberation Army of Hebei-Shandong-Henan annihilated two brigades of the reactionaries in the enemy's rear on November 19th to 21st. This is a powerful punishment for Chiang Kai-shek's monstrous crimes, an action of victory to coordinate with the defense of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, and also a serious blow to the reactionary派’s deployment to attack Daming, Handan, and Xingtai!
　　The Hebei-Shandong-Henan front has already had its fifth major victory. This victory is a continued development of our mobile tactics. Our army advanced southward in large strides, abandoning all the enemy's forward outposts and solid fortifications, and with swift and decisive actions and extremely high morale, penetrated deep into the enemy's territory, quickly sought out its command center, and thoroughly annihilated it, then swept northward. In less than 48 hours, two enemy brigades had completely laid down their arms. In combat operations, Chairman Mao's methods of operation are being used more and more skillfully, and the new heroism of the masses is creating more and more inspiring historical achievements. We are becoming stronger and stronger, and we are becoming more and more resourceful.
　　This blow threatens the enemy's heart. Xinxiang and Kaifeng were shocked, affecting the enemy's entire deployment. The most interesting thing is that the 85th Division was kept busy. The 85th Division is the backbone of Chiang's army in northern Henan. In early November, Chiang Kai-shek attempted to attack Daming, Handan, and Xingtai. On November 11th, he hurriedly transferred the 85th Division from Xinxiang to Anyang. Before it had time to move out, Xinxiang and Jiaozuo simultaneously sounded the alarm. On November 11th, one of our main force corps suddenly attacked Wuzhi County, south of the Daoqing Railway, threatening Xinxiang from the west. The 85th Division was again forced to hurriedly move south on the 16th, arriving near Jiaozuo on the 18th. Before it had time to rest, it had to be transferred east to Xinxiang on the 20th to reinforce the defenses. This example alone fully exposes the weakness of the reactionary派’s insufficient troops. Now, although the reactionary派 has used nearly 50 brigades of troops in the three battlefields of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area, those that have been annihilated have been annihilated, and those that are guarding are guarding. The total number of mobile troops is actually less than eight or nine brigades. If he wants to organize a new offensive, he must also withdraw some corps to other battlefields, and the battle line will become even wider. This is simply incomparable to the spirit of sending more than 30 brigades in August to attempt to "annihilate Liu Bocheng's main force in one fell swoop." The reactionary派’s offensive in our area is becoming increasingly exhausted. We are about to reach the top of the mountain. The time to recover lost land and drive the reactionary派 out of our land is approaching. As long as we eliminate a few more of his brigades, it will come!
　　Every victory brings people greater confidence and awakening. Now, after their own practical experience, the soldiers and civilians of the entire region have an unshakable belief that Chiang's army will be defeated and our army will be victorious. After we implemented land reform, more than 90% of the rural population supported our proposition and actively supported the war, while Chiang Kai-shek spread rumors everywhere that landlords were being liquidated by the Communist Party and the peasants, and that the landlords were their people. In fact, after eight years of war of resistance and land reform in the liberated areas, the landlords supported the Communist Party. They can live peacefully in the liberated areas and live a democratic life. Therefore, after Chiang's army arrived, some landlords suggested that they would rather be liquidated by the Eighth Route Army than let the Central Army stay for a day. After their own long-term experience, the landlords believed that the people must win and that the working people should be the masters of the land. When the reactionary派 forced the implementation of the "counter-settlement" movement, most of them adopted a policy of retreating nominally but not in reality. Now, in nearly 200 counties in the region, nearly one-third of the region is in battle. Due to the people's firm belief, we have opened up the situation in most areas, widely launched guerrilla warfare, and effectively cooperated with the frontal battlefield.
　　Chiang Kai-shek completely failed to see this law of historical development, and recklessly attacked Yan'an and convened an illegal "National Assembly." This is his own path to ruin, accelerating his death. Although he may still occupy several cities and stage a few more deceptions, the people have learned enough from him. The people have awakened, and a few more deceptions are nothing more than giving the people some more beneficial lessons, making the people even more aware that Chiang Kai-shek is a traitorous national traitor. In military terms, he has been annihilated thirty-seven brigades, and his offensive capability is about to be exhausted. The military crisis is increasingly exposed, and the fate of being doomed to failure cannot be saved in any way.
　　To accelerate the death of the reactionary派 and accelerate the arrival of a full-scale counter-offensive is our current task. For this reason, we must continue to win victories, continue to annihilate the enemy in large numbers, and strive for the sixth, seventh, and eighth new victories, and use our new victorious actions to defend the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, defend the Party Central Committee, and defend Chairman Mao. Not only must the main force be able to fight annihilation battles, but we also call on the local corps to work hard to learn Chairman Mao's combat methods, learn the combat experience of the main force, improve combat effectiveness, overcome guerrilla habits, fight independently, annihilate the enemy more, and automatically and effectively cooperate with the main force in combat. We call on doing a good job in the work of the occupied areas and guerrilla areas, trapping the reactionary army in dead cities, and letting us eliminate them all cleanly! But we must remember not to be proud, complacent, or impatient because of victory. We must still be diligent and conscientious, step up war preparations, step up work in the rear, and carry forward the spirit of heroic sacrifice and hard struggle. We must know that this section of the road before climbing to the top of the mountain is the most difficult. We must always remember the motto "He who travels a hundred li considers ninety as half." Remember not to be proud, complacent, or impatient because of victory. We must still be diligent and conscientious, step up war preparations, step up work in the rear, and carry forward the spirit of heroic sacrifice and hard struggle. We must know that this section of the road before climbing to the top of the mountain is the most difficult. We must always remember the motto "He who travels a hundred li considers ninety as half."

### 再祝冀鲁豫前线大捷

　　再祝冀鲁豫前线大捷
    正当蒋介石进攻延安召开非法“国大”和企图进犯我大名、邯郸、邢台的时候，我晋冀鲁豫人民解放军于十一月十九日至二十一日在敌人的后方歼灭了反动派两个旅，这是对蒋介石滔天罪行的有力膺惩，是以胜利的行动来配合陕甘宁边区的保卫战，同时也给予反动派进攻大名、邯郸、邢台的部署以严重打击！
    冀鲁豫前线已是第五次大捷了。这次胜利是我机动战术的继续发展，我军大踏步的向南挺进，撇开敌人一切前锋据点和坚固筑城，以神速果敢的行动和极度高昂的士气，透入敌人纵深，迅速寻取其指挥中枢，加以彻底歼灭，尔后向北席卷，不到四十八小时敌人两个旅已全部放下武器。在战斗行动中，毛主席的作战方法正被更加熟练的在运用，群众的新英雄主义正在创造更多可歌可泣的史迹，我们是愈打愈强，愈打愈有办法。
    这一打击，威胁到敌人的心脏，新乡、开封为之震惊，牵动了敌人的整个部署。最有意思的是把一个八十五师忙得不可开交；八十五师是豫北蒋军的骨干，十一月上旬蒋介石企图进攻大名、邯郸、邢台，十一月十一日把八十五师匆匆从新乡调到安阳，还没来得及出动，新乡焦作同时告警，我某主力兵团，于十一月十一日突然袭入道清路南武陟县城，从西面威胁新乡，八十五师又被迫匆匆于十六日南下，十八日抵焦作附近，还没来得及休息，廿日又只得东调新乡增防。单从这个例子里就可以充分暴露反动派兵力不足的弱点。现在反动派在晋冀鲁豫区的三个战场上，虽然动用了近五十个旅的兵力，但消灭的被消灭，守备的守备，机动兵力总数实不足八、九个旅，如果他想组织新的进攻，就还必须抽走一些兵团到别的战场去，战线更加辽阔，这与八月间出动卅多个旅企图“一举歼灭刘伯承主力”时的气慨，简直无法比拟了。反动派对我区的攻势已日趋枯竭，我们快要走上山顶了，收复失地把反动派从我们土地上赶出去的时机日益接近了，只要再消灭他几个旅就会到来的！
    每一次胜利带给人们以更大的信心和觉醒，现在全区军民经过自己的实际体验，对于蒋军必败我军必胜的信念已是牢不可破。在我们实行土地改革后，农村百分之九十以上的人口拥护我们的主张，并积极支援战争，而蒋介石到处造谣说地主被共产党和农民清算了，地主是他们的人。实际上，解放区在八年抗战和土地改革之后，地主对共产党是拥护的。他们在解放区能过安然日子，能过民主生活，所以在蒋军到来之后，有些地主提出宁让八路军清算，不让中央军住一天。地主经过自己的长期体验，认定人民一定要胜利，劳动人民应该是土地的主人，当反动派强迫实行“倒算”运动时，他们多数都是采取明退暗不退。现在全区近二百个县的地区，将近三分之一的地区正在战斗，由于人民这种坚定的信念，大部地区我们已经打开了局面，广泛的开展了游击战争，有力的配合了正面战场。
    蒋介石完全没有看到这种历史发展的规律，冒险进攻延安，召开非法“国大”，这是他自走绝路，加速了他的死亡，虽然他还可能攻占若干城市，再演出几幕骗局，但人民已经从他身上学习了足够的东西，人民已觉醒起来，再来一些欺骗，也不过等于给人民多上了一些有益的课，使人民更加认识蒋介石是汉奸卖国贼而已。在军事上他已被歼三十七个旅，进攻能力快要枯竭，军事危机日益暴露，注定要失败的命运是无任何办法可以挽救的了。
    我们要加速反动派的死亡，加速全面反攻的到来，是我们当前奋斗的任务。为此我们必须继续胜利，继续大量歼灭敌人，争取第六次，第七次，第八次新的胜利，用我们新的胜利行动来保卫陕甘宁边区，保卫党中央，保卫毛主席。不仅要主力军会打歼灭战，我们还号召地方兵团努力学习毛主席的作战方法，学习主力军的作战经验，提高战斗力，克服游击习气，独当一面的作战，更多的歼灭敌人，自动的有力的配合主力军作战；我们号召把沦陷区游击区的工作做好，把反动军困守在死城里，让我们各个消灭干净！但我们切记不要因为胜利而骄傲麻痹和急燥，仍须兢兢业业，加紧备战，加紧后方工作，发扬英勇牺牲艰苦奋斗的作风，须知爬上山顶前这一段路是最艰苦的，必须时时记取“行百里者半九十”这句格言。记不要因为胜利而骄傲麻痹和急燥，仍须兢兢业业，加紧备战，加紧后方工作，发扬英勇牺牲艰苦奋斗的作风，须知爬上山顶前这一段路是最艰苦的，必须时时记取“行百里者半九十”这句格言。
