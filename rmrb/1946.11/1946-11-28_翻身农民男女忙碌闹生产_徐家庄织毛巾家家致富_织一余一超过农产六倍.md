　　Emancipated Peasants, Men and Women, Busily Engage in Production
    Xu Village Flourishes by Weaving Towels, Every Family Prospering
    Weaving Generates More Than Six Times the Agricultural Output
    [Our newspaper's dispatch from Wei County, 24th] In Xu Village, no one is idle, and towel weaving is thriving. In Wei County's Xu Village, after the land reform, the peasants recovered 3,000 mu of land (accounting for half of the village's land) from illegal landlords like Xu Dahuozi, and received compensation of several million yuan. Their enthusiasm for production has greatly increased. In addition to diligent farming, they are also actively engaged in towel weaving as a sideline. The number of towel looms in the village has increased from seven two years ago to 270 at present, involving 1,400 people in 340 households. Men and women in every family are weaving towels, while old women and men are making thread spools, winding thread, hemming towels, and selling towels. Everyone is busy. The village can produce an average of 200 dozens of towels per day, with each dozen earning 1,000 yuan. The annual profit can reach 74 million yuan, which is more than six times the profit from agricultural production. (This year, the whole village harvested a total of 140,000 jin of grain, 48,000 jin of cotton, and 100,000 jin of wheat, with a total value of 12 million yuan.) Assuming each person eats an average of 50 jin of rice per month, the 1,400 people need a total of 33 million yuan, meaning that people are earning more than they need to consume. Since starting to weave towels, the lives of every family have greatly improved. The masses are excitedly saying, "Having a loom means no worries about food." At present, the village has organized a cooperative to sell the towels collectively. With the call to develop winter production, the output will increase even further.

　　翻身农民男女忙碌闹生产
    徐家庄织毛巾家家致富
    织一余一超过农产六倍
    【本报威县二十四日电】家无闲人街无懒汉，徐家庄毛巾业发达。威县徐家庄，经过了土地改革，农民前后收回非法地主徐大霍子等土地三千亩。（占全村土地一半），赔偿款数百万元。生产情绪大为提高，除勤为耕种外，并纷纷经营毛巾副业。全村毛巾机，已由前年七架增至目前二百七十架，三百四十户人家，一千四百多人参加。家家男子、妇女织毛巾，老婆婆老汉做线穗、抡线子、碑毛巾、卖毛巾、人人不闲。该村平均每天能出毛巾二百打，每打可赚一千元。全年可赚七千四百万元，获利高出农业生产六倍以上。（今年全村共收粮十四万斤，棉花四万八千斤、麦子十万斤、总值一千二百万元。）若以每人每月平均吃五十斤米计算，一千四百人共需三千三百万元，已做到织一余一。自织毛巾以来，家家生活都大为改善，群众兴高采烈的说：“有张机子就不愁吃”。目下该村已组织合作社，统一向外销售。今后在开展冬季生产号召下，产量将更增加。
