    Cooperative Hero Xu @qun Leads Textile Production
    Every Family in Shangjing Wears New Clothes
    Yang Shuanggeng Creates Fanglou Water-Line Hand-Operated Loom
    [This Newspaper Reports] Xu @qun, a cooperative hero from Pingshun, led the women of Shangjing @ to engage in textile production, ensuring that everyone wears new clothes and every family has a new quilt. Shangjing Village was originally a poor, small village. Xu @qun, having learned from experiences in other areas, initially wanted to establish a cooperative, but the masses could not afford shares. So, he first borrowed seven jin of cotton from the district cooperative and had the women spin it. He also organized poor people to transport goods, earning more than 3,000 yuan, which was used to exchange for cotton in Lin County. He first organized three spinning groups, spinning the yarn and then transporting it to Lin County to exchange for cotton. The money earned was used to buy three looms, growing from four weavers to fourteen weavers. Over the past year, they have spun a total of 252 jin of cotton and woven 4,740 chi of cloth. Thirty-six spinners and fourteen weavers earned a total of 42,300 yuan, 39 jin and six liang of cotton, and more than 1,500 chi of cloth. This winter, everyone wore a new cotton outfit, and all 31 households in the village made 32 cotton quilts. Only three households did not earn enough cloth, so the cooperative lent them six zhang of cloth. Every family wears new clothes, and everyone is filled with joy.
    [Another Report] There was also a hero named Yang Shuanggeng at the Pingshun Labor Hero Conference, who has done a lot of research on looms, but he had never passed on his knowledge before. He thought that if he passed it on, he would lose his job. After rent reduction and land reform last winter, he thought, "If it weren't for the Communist Party and the people, where would I be?" So, he decided to pass on his skills. In June of this year, he went to the Fifth District Cooperative and decided to promote textile work in the Fifth District. He first created a Fanglou water-line hand-operated loom. Using this machine to weave cloth, one zhang of yarn can weave one zhang of cloth, and the woven cloth is of good quality and uniform. After this machine was created, it was promoted throughout the district. More than 100 machines have now been made, including ten made by himself, and he carefully taught 40 workers. He also traveled tirelessly to Xishe, Guangwu, and other villages to repair looms, and disseminated his experience in configuring the sizing solution according to the different seasons. He is now planning to create a self-winding and self-releasing loom (without manual winding), which is expected to be successful this winter.

    合作英雄许＠群领导纺织
    上井家家穿新衣
    杨双根创造方楼水线手拉机
    【本报讯】平顺合作英雄许村群领导上井＠妇女纺织，做到人人穿新衣，家家盖新被。上井村原是个贫苦的小村子，许＠群接受了各地经验，先想办合作社，但群众入不起股，他便先从区联社贷了七斤花，让妇女纺织，又组织了穷人运输赚了三千余元，到林县换回棉花，先组织了三个纺线小组，纺了线再运到林县换花。赚下的钱买了三架织布机，从四个织妇发展到十四个织妇。一年来共纺花二百五十二斤，织布四千七百四十尺；三十六个纺妇，十四个织妇共赚洋四万二千三百元，赚花三十九斤六两，布一千五百余尺，今冬每人穿了一身新棉衣，全村三十一户做了三十二条棉被，只有三户没有赚到布，合作社又借给六丈布。家家穿新衣，人人喜洋洋。
    【又讯】平顺劳英会上还有位英雄叫杨双根，对织布机很有研究，但以前始终不传；他想如果传出去，自己就没了饭碗。去冬减租翻身后，他想如果没有共产党和老百姓那还有自己？便决心把自己的一套技术传出去。今年六月到五区区联社，他决心开展五区纺织工作，先创造了一个方楼水线手拉机，用此机织布，经一丈线可织一丈布，织的布好而均匀。此机造出后推广全区，现已造出一百余架，其中自己亲手造成十架，并细心教会了四十个工人。他又不辞劳苦到西社、广武等村修理织机，并把自己所创造的浆线按四季不同配面等经验到处传播。现在还计划创造自卷自退织布机（不用手卷）今冬可告成功。
