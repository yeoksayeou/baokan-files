    Southern Shanxi Behind Enemy Lines Firmly in Our Hands

    [This newspaper, Yangcheng, 9th dispatch] (Delayed arrival) Our reporter stationed in the southern Shanxi guerrilla base area reports: In the rear of the Chiang Kai-shek forces in southern Shanxi, centered on Wenxi and including Wenxi, Xiaxian, Anyi, Pinglu, Qishi, Wanquan, Jishan, Xinjiang, Anbei, Yilin, Jilu (the above three counties are newly established), the powerful guerrilla base area established by the Eighth Route Army local corps and militia guerrillas has become a bomb in the belly of the Chiang Kai-shek troops invading southern Shanxi. Wang Yongjun and Political Commissar Chai Zemin, the founders of this guerrilla base area, personally commanded the powerful guerrilla group, and with the full support of the local people, galloped behind the Chiang Kai-shek lines, and in the past three months, recovered a vast territory of more than 26,000 square li, liberated dozens of important strongholds such as Yanzhang, Peijie, and Yuwangcheng, compressed the invading Chiang Kai-shek troops into transportation lines and a few isolated strongholds, frequently intercepted Chiang Kai-shek military transports and attacked the communist military bases, destroyed most of the evil bully secret agent regimes supported by Chiang Kai-shek, restored democratic regimes, and protected the lives and property of the broad masses of the people. With the close combination of the army and the people, this guerrilla group has been tempered into an invincible force. In order to remove this big bomb, the Chiang Kai-shek troops did not hesitate to mobilize troops, and successively dispatched the 30th Brigade, 47th Brigade, 53rd Brigade, and the New 4th Brigade (remnants of the 31st Brigade) in cooperation with the Yan Xishan puppet 7th District Security Regiment, 15th District Security Regiment, and the "Love the Hometown Regiment" and "Revenge Squad" and other special agent armed forces of various counties to carry out four large-scale "sweeps" and countless "suppressions", all of which were completely smashed. According to extremely incomplete statistics: from July 11 to October 11, in the three months, a total of 586 battles were fought, killing and wounding 1,458 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers, destroying 187 bunkers, capturing 2 60mm mortars, 8 grenade launchers, 10 various machine guns, more than 500 long and short guns, about 30,000 rounds of ammunition, and countless other ammunition and materials.

    游击集团屡创蒋伪
    晋南敌后确掌我手
    光复国土：二万六千方里
    毙伤蒋伪：一千四百余人
    平毁碉堡：一百六十七座
    【本报阳城九日电】（迟到）本社驻晋南游击根据地记者报导：在以闻喜为中心，包括闻喜、夏县、安邑、平陆、犄氏、万泉、稷山、新绛、安北、猗临、稷麓（以上三县为新划县）等十一县的晋南蒋后方，八路军地方兵团和民兵游击队所建立的强大游击根据地，已成为侵占晋南蒋军的腹中的炸弹。这一游击根据地的建立者王墉军和柴泽民政委，亲自指挥强大的游击集团，在当地人民的全力支援下，驰骋蒋后方，三个月来共收复二万六千余平方华里的广大土地，解放堰掌、裴介、禹王城等数十个重要据点，将进犯蒋军压缩到交通线和少数孤立据点内，经常截击蒋军运输并袭击共军事基地，将蒋军卵冀的恶霸特务政权大部摧毁，重新恢复了民主政权，保护了广大人民的生命财产。在军民紧密结合下，这个游击集团已锻炼成不可战胜的力量，蒋军为了想要去掉这个大炸弹，曾不惜劳师动众，先后抽调三十旅、四十七旅、五十三旅、新四旅（三十一旅之残部）配合阎伪第七区保安团、第十五区保安团及各县“爱乡团”、“复仇队”等特务武装进行四次大“扫荡”和无数次的“清剿”，均被全部粉碎。据极不完全的统计：自七月十一日至十月十一日的三个月中，共作战五百八十六次，毙伤蒋军一千四百五十八人，平毁碉堡一百八十七座，缴获六○炮二门、掷弹筒八个，各种机枪十挺，长短枪五百余枝，子弹约三万发，其他弹药物资无算。
