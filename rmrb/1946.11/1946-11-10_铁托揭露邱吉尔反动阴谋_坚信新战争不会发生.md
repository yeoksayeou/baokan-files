　　Tito Exposes Churchill's Reactionary Conspiracy
    Firmly Believes a New War Will Not Happen
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 6th—Belgrade News: Premier of Yugoslavia, Marshal Tito, gave a speech to a large and crowded mass of people at Republic Square here on the 4th. He firmly stated that war is impossible, “because the people of Yugoslavia, the people of Britain and the United States, and the people of any other country do not want war.” He pointed out that although "the reactionary elements who provoke war are clamoring for war, coercing with war, and rattling swords and guns, war is impossible." Tito revealed that Churchill is one of the important reactionary elements, and today "besides depriving the people of freedom and independence or allowing reactionary elements in certain countries to oppress the people, he has done nothing. Today, the war instigator Churchill is their standard." Tito finally stated forcefully: Yugoslavia will reject all provocations from war instigators, because Yugoslavia will use its military strength for the cause of reconstruction.

　　铁托揭露邱吉尔反动阴谋
    坚信新战争不会发生
    【新华社延安六日电】贝尔格莱德讯：南总理铁托元帅四日在此间共和广场向广大而拥挤的群众发表演说，他坚称不可能有战争，“因为南国人民、英美人民及其它任何国家人民都不要战争。”他指出虽然“挑拨战争的反动分子叫嚣战争，要挟战争，把刀枪弄得丁当作响，但不可能有战争。”铁托揭露邱吉尔是重要的反动分子之一，他今天“除了剥夺人民的自由与独立或准许某些国家反动分子压迫人民之外，他无所作为，今天战争挑拨者邱吉尔为他们的标准。”铁托最后力称：南国将拒绝战争挑拨者的一切挑拨，因为南斯拉夫要以其兵力用诸复兴事业。
