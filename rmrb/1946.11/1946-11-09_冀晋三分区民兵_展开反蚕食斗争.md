Xinhua News Agency, Jin察冀 (Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region), 3rd. (delayed dispatch). The militia of the 3rd Sub-district of Hebei-Shanxi are launching an anti-attrition struggle along the Pinghan, Zhengtai, and Tongpu lines. On September 29th, 1,500 Chiang troops launched an encroachment attack on the heartland of Huolu in the Liberated Area. The county's militia rose up in self-defense and fought fiercely all day, killing or wounding more than 50 Chiang troops. On the 25th, the Zhengding militia engaged in fierce fighting with the Chiang troops encroaching on the county for two days, killing or wounding more than 60 Chiang troops. Two trains of Chiang reinforcements were also destroyed by the militia. After Yan's troops on the Tongpu line captured Dingxiang city, the county's militia laid mines all over the city, making it difficult for Yan's troops to move. The militia in the suburbs of the county seat were also very active, often using guerrilla tactics to lure the enemy into stepping on mines. From October 6th to 16th, in ten days, they killed or wounded more than 100 Yan troops below the rank of battalion commander. The Shouyang militia fought 35 times in October, with more than 1,000 militia members participating, killing or wounding 54 Yan troops. The Jingxing militia, active on the Zhengtai line, continuously harassed the rear of the Chiang troops to cooperate with the anti-attrition struggle of the militia in the hinterland, and laid mines around the Jingxing coal mine and Niangziguan strongholds to prevent the Chiang troops from transporting troops. On the 17th of last month, during the day, a Quyang militia company entered the Chiang military fortress in Xiaoguozhuang, Xinle, and all the Chiang troops in the fortress were captured. On the same day, the militia company, in cooperation with a unit of the Eighth Route Army, captured five Chiang and puppet fortresses, including Shili Pu East and Ziyanlou, about two miles away from Xinle city. In this battle, the militia captured four small cannons, eight rifles, and captured 21 Chiang soldiers below the rank of company commander.
