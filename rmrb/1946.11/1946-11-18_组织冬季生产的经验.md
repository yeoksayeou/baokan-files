    Experiences in Organizing Winter Production
    Taihang Second Prefecture Office
    Since last year, we have found a way to organize winter production, enabling the masses to obtain huge benefits. According to summaries from various places: Ping Shun gained more than 20 million yuan, Li Cheng more than 14 million yuan, Lu Cheng more than 11.05 million yuan. Incomplete statistics from Yu She, Wu Xiang, and Tai Gu counties show that organized transportation earned over 13 million yuan, while unorganized transportation earned over 560,000 yuan. Now, we will introduce some of the basic experiences created during the movement.
    1. Implement Ideological Education on “Cultivating Three, Saving One” to Increase Wealth
    The main ideological obstacles to developing winter production are the peasants' winter leisure mentality of "half a year of hard work, half a year of leisure" and complacent sentiments. To resolve these ideas, check the extent to which "cultivating three, saving one" has been achieved, and inspire the masses to consciously engage in winter production. For example, Jiangtang Village in Yu She calculated that it was still 1,000 *shi* (a unit of dry measure, approx. 100 liters) short of achieving "cultivating three, saving one," and immediately clarified the direction by organizing sideline production. Out of 375 able-bodied men and women in the village, 338 were organized. Within 70 days, they earned more than 336,000 yuan through transportation, workshops, weaving, and business, which could buy more than 1,250 *shi* of grain at market prices, thus achieving "cultivating three, saving one." Idlers Zhang Yuancheng and Wei Fuchuan also participated in production, and both wore new clothes for the New Year. Under the leadership of labor hero Wei Yuansheng, Wei Jia Zhuang in Lu Cheng calculated that the village needed to earn 110,000 yuan through winter production to make up for the shortfall in "cultivating three, saving one." Based on the village's situation, the village cooperative organized 56 people to engage in 20 different types of production, earning more than 200,000 yuan, exceeding "cultivating three, saving one" by more than 100,000 yuan. Secondly, the method of comparative accounting was used to inspire the masses to actively produce. In order to carry out weaving and transportation work, Chuan Di in Ping Shun calculated the benefits of Han Juhua's weaving at a mass meeting. Han Juhua's family of three bought 1.4 *jin* (a unit of weight, approx. 500 grams) of cotton in the spring, and by the autumn they had woven 4.2 *zhang* (a unit of length, approx. 3.3 meters) of cloth, enough for each person to have a new set of clothes, solving the problem of seasonal changes. This inspired the masses' enthusiasm for production. At the same time, typical production households were introduced and praised in winter schools, and the fruits of emancipation were regularly invested in production... The implementation of these ideological education efforts is the key to winter production.
    2. Organize Different Productions According to Specific Conditions and the Masses' Willingness and Needs
    The first important issue in winter production is "getting organized" (including labor, idle capital, and technical talent). In some areas, the masses used to have the habit of winter leisure production, but they faced many difficulties when working on their own. In the winter, Shannan Di in Ping Shun summarized transportation and some said: It is too wasteful to have one person drive one animal, others said: People who know how to do business don't tell everyone when they see money to be made. Everyone unanimously felt that they suffered a loss because they were not organized. Thus, the whole village quickly organized itself. It was still inconvenient to organize only the villages, so several villages discussed setting up transportation stations to be responsible for receiving transportation personnel and finding helpers to buy and sell goods, which reduced the waste of time on the ground. At first, Chuan Di only organized labor for transportation, but later they felt that the capital was small. After discussion, they organized the small capital of each group, and both manpower and money became shares, turning into labor-capital cooperation, overcoming the difficulties of each producing on their own.
    After being organized, do whatever you can based on local conditions, the people in your group, and capital conditions. For example, Taoyang Village in Yu She organized four winter production mutual aid societies (i.e., small-scale labor-capital cooperation), including two mills, one vinegar workshop, one saltpeter workshop, two noodle mills, and four carrying teams. Wang Jia Zhuang in Li Cheng, under the principle of "each doing what they can, relying on the mountains for sustenance," has a weaving group, a firewood gathering group, a selling chopsticks group (self-made), a rafter cutting group, and a charcoal burning group in winter production, as well as a flour milling group, a transportation group, and a tofu workshop, operating 20 different businesses.
    There are three keys in winter production that must be firmly grasped: First, through mass discussions, transform the old cooperatives and establish new cooperatives, greatly developing small-scale labor-capital cooperatives, and through them, organize the various productions that the masses are willing and able to engage in. For example, the masses welcomed the transformation of the Qiaogou cooperative in Li Cheng and the Doukou cooperative in Ping Shun. The mountain goods cooperative in Qilitan in He Shun, the Dongfeng Ren in Xi Yang, and the Tongtan cooperative in Zuo Quan played a decisive organizational role in winter production, and the widespread development of small-scale cooperatives in Li and Ping played an even greater role. Second, weaving work. In the old areas, improving technology is the main thing. In new areas without a weaving foundation, it is necessary to pay great attention to solving the difficulties of tools and raw materials and teaching techniques. Last year, various places invited teachers, opened weaving training classes, organized carpenters to set up weaving tool factories, and the cooperative unified the making of spinning wheels, issuing cotton, collecting yarn, and collecting cloth. These experiences need to be greatly promoted. Cadres must break the idea that weaving is a matter for women and managed by the Women's Federation. Third, develop transportation work. To organize this work, someone must be responsible for unifying the solicitation of labor, and labor and capital must be combined to organize transportation and sales. It is necessary to constantly understand the surrounding market prices and supply and demand conditions to avoid losses. Cooperative transportation should become the link of winter production.
    Small-scale cooperatives were created by the masses themselves last winter and are a form suitable for various production activities, a cooperation between labor and capital. The mutual aid societies in Yu She are named after what they do, such as the what-group or what-team. Because this organization is formed by combining people with different labor skills and capital of different sizes, reasonable profit distribution is very important. The experiences of various places include the following points: 1. Determine the profit sharing ratio according to the proportion of labor and capital, and then distribute profits according to shares. Some use labor to top shares, which is more convenient for calculation. 2. Encourage technology. 3. Frequent accounting and profit distribution make it easy to see results and stimulate production.
    In addition, combining agriculture with spring plowing preparation is also an aspect of winter production that cannot be ignored. Li, Lu, Ping, and Hu counties did not pay enough attention to this aspect last winter, resulting in difficulties such as shortage of firewood and manure this spring, and also forming the masses' idea of attaching importance to sideline production and neglecting agriculture, which could not be reversed for a while. This is a great lesson. Pingdong did better in this regard. Under the promotion of labor hero Dong Chuangcheng, Zhu Village calculated the amount of firewood needed by each household before the summer harvest and organized firewood chopping. By the end of the lunar year, the village had chopped a total of 267,000 *jin* of firewood, and old men and children were all involved in the firewood chopping movement. Villages such as Ying Zhuang, Da Dong Quan, and Gu Dong all had firewood chopping groups, giving priority to chopping firewood for military families and preparing enough for at least half a year for themselves. The experience of He Shun, Zuo Quan, and Wu Xiang in opening oil mills, raising pigs and sheep, and trampling on the manure yard to accumulate fertilizer should be greatly promoted this year.
    3. Several Key Issues in Carrying Out the Movement
    In addition to ideological mobilization, the unity of leadership is a major issue at the beginning of the movement, especially among village-level cadres. For example, winter production in Chi Tou Village in Lu Cheng did not take off because the cadres did not care and the masses did not move. Mai Cang Village in Li Cheng only started after the problem of disunity among cadres was resolved. In other places, the lack of concerted effort by hero cadres also hindered the development of the movement. On the contrary, in places such as Chuan Di and Yang Jing Di in Ping Shun, Bei Liu and Ren Zhuang in Li Cheng, and Wei Jia Zhuang in Lu Cheng, winter production formed a mass movement because the leadership was unified, the cadres and heroes were of one mind, and they took the lead in leading the masses themselves. Labor hero Zhou Li in Hu Guan led the whole village in transportation, and his wife led the whole village in weaving. After the movement is launched, the leadership must pay great attention to it, promptly exchange and praise the typical examples in the movement, clarify the direction, boost morale, and disseminate experience. Last winter, Ping Shun promptly disseminated the experience of the small-scale cooperative in Yang Jing Di, which had a great impact not only on the county but also on other regions. Timely inspection during the movement is an important issue in improving the movement. The inspection of the base points such as Xi Jing and Nan Wei Quan in Li Cheng played a decisive role in promoting winter production in the county. In addition, putting forward catchy slogans based on the opinions of the masses during the movement also greatly stimulated and inspired the movement. For example, when mobilizing production, Xin An Village in Lu Cheng proposed: "Spinning cotton and weaving cloth to keep warm, carrying loads and transporting to avoid small financial difficulties", "Weaving and transporting is not a burden, everyone work hard and do well" When the fear of struggle was discovered, it was proposed: "Don't be greedy, don't be a bully, don't be afraid to show your wealth." After the autumn harvest, the village was very complacent, and proposed: "Get used to being gluttonous, get used to being lazy, regret is too late when you are hungry", "Sit and eat and don't move, even the mountains will be eaten up", these slogans played a great role.

    组织冬季生产的经验
    太行二专署办公室
    从去年开始，我们摸到了组织冬季生产的门径，使群众获得巨大的利益。据各地总结：平顺获利二千余万元，黎城一千四百余万元，潞城一千一百零五万元，榆社、武乡、太谷三县运输一次的不完全统计，有组织的赚一千三百万元，无组织的赚五十六万余元。现将运动中创造的基本经验，介绍几点。
    一、贯彻耕三余一增加财富的思想教育
    开展冬季生产的主要思想障碍，是农民“半年辛苦半年闲”的冬闲思想和“自满”情绪等。解决这些思想，检查耕三余一达到程度，启发群众自觉进行冬季生产。如榆社讲堂村计算离耕三余一尚差一千石，当即明确方向，组织副业生产。全村男女劳力三百七十五个，组织起来三百三十八个，七十天内运输、作坊、纺织、营商，共赚三十三万六千余元，按市价可买粮一千二百五十多石，达到了耕三余一。二流子张元成、魏福全都参加了生产，过年都穿上了新衣。潞城魏家庄在劳英魏元盛领导下，计算出全村冬季生产要赚十一万元，补足耕三余一的缺数；村合作社根据本村情况，组织了五十六人经营了二十种不同的生产，共赚二十余万元，完成耕三余一还超过十万多元。其次，用对比算账的办法，启发群众积极生产。平顺川底为开展纺织运输工作，在群众会上计算了韩菊花的纺织得利。韩菊花一家三口，春天买了一斤四两花，翻腾到秋前，共织下四丈二尺布，每人一身新衣服，解决了换季问题。这样启发了群众生产热情，再及时在冬学介绍表扬典型的生产户，经常进行翻身生产教育，组织翻身果实投入生产………。这些思想教育的贯彻，是冬季生产的关键。
    二、根据具体条件和群众自愿与需要组织不同生产
    冬季生产中第一个重要问题是“组织起来”（包括劳力、游资和技术人才）。有些地区群众过去也有冬闲生产的习惯，但各顾各困难很多。平顺山南底去冬总结运输，有的说：一个人赶一个牲口太浪费工，有的说：会做买卖的人，看到有钱赚，也不和大家说。大家一致感到没组织起来吃了亏。这样全村便很快组织起来。光各村组织起来还不方便，数村共同讨论设运输站，负责招待运输人，找脚帮助买卖货，这样就减少了地头误工。川底开始只组织起劳力进行运输，后来感到本钱小，经过讨论把各组的小本钱都组织起来，人力钱都顶股，变为劳资合作，克服了各顾各生产的困难。
    组织起来之后，根据当地和本组人以及资本的条件，能干啥干啥。如榆社桃阳村组织四个冬季生产互助社（即劳资合作的小型合作）包括两座磨坊、一座醋坊、一座硝坊、二座粉坊、四个扁担队。黎城王家庄在“各尽所能靠山吃山”的方针下，冬季生产中有纺织组、打柴组、卖筷组（自造）、砍椽组、烧木炭组，还有磨面组、运输组、豆腐坊等，经营着二十种不同业务。
    冬季生产中有三个关键必须紧紧掌握：首先是经过群众讨论改造旧合作社，成立新合作社，大大发展小型劳资合作社，通过他们把群众愿搞能搞的各种生产组织起来。如黎城桥沟、平顺豆口合作社，经改造后，群众很欢迎。和顺七里滩的山货合作社，昔阳东丰稔，左权桐滩合作社，在冬季生产上起了决定的组织作用，黎、平小型合作社的普遍发展作用更大。其次是纺织工作。在老区提高技术是主要的，纺织无基础的新区，解决工具原料的困难，传学技术必须十分重视。去年各地请教师，开纺训班，组织木匠开办纺织工具厂，由合作社统一做纺车，发花收线收布等经验，需要大大发扬。干部必须打破纺织是妇女们的事，由妇救会管的思想。第三是展运输工作。组织这一工作要有人统一揽脚，劳资结合组织运销，必须经常了解周围市场物价及供需情况，才不致吃亏，合作运输应成为冬季生产的纽带。
    小型合作社是去冬由群众自己创造的，适合各式各样生产活动的形式，是劳力与资本的合作。榆社互助社，有的做什么就叫什么组或队。这种组织因为是由不同劳力技术的人和大小不等的资本结合而成，因而合理分红就是很重要的问题。各地经验有这样几点：一、按劳资比额确定分红比率，然后按股分红。有的是劳力顶股，计算更方便。二、鼓励技术。三、勤算账分红，容易见成绩，刺激生产。
    此外结合农业作春耕准备，也是冬季生产中不可忽视的内容之一。黎、潞、平、壶去冬因对这方面注意不够，形成今春少柴缺粪的困难，而且形成群众重副轻农思想，一时转不过来，这是很大的教训。平东对这方面作的较好。朱村在劳英董创成的推动下，计算各家灶火，到夏收前需柴多少，有组织的砍柴。到阳历年底全村共打下柴二十六万七千斤，老汉儿童都卷入打柴运动。营庄、大东铨、谷洞等村，都有打柴组，先给军属打柴，自己也至少准备够半年烧。中小川劳动英雄程松在群英会上学下火薰肥办法，回去就自己先烧，并积极教别人，带起了全村，光他组薰下一千多担粪。和顺、左权、武乡等地开油坊养猪羊踩圈积肥的经验，今年要大大推广。
    三、开展运动的几个关键问题
    除了思想动员之外，在运动开始，领导力量的统一是很大的问题，特别表现在村级干部。如潞城赤头村冬季生产没搞起来，原因是干部不管，群众也不动。黎城麦仓村，是经过解决干部不团结问题才动起来。还有的地方是英雄干部不一股劲，也防碍运动开展。相反如平顺川底、羊井底，黎城北流、仁庄，潞城魏家庄等，冬季生产形成群众运动，都是领导力量统一，干部英雄一条心，自己动手带领群众。壶关劳动英雄周里有带起全村运输，他老婆带起全村纺织。运动开展后，领导上要十分重视，及时交流表扬运动中的典型范例，明确方向，鼓舞情绪，传播经验。平顺去冬及时传播了羊井底小型合作社的经验，不但对本县、对其他地区影响也很大。运动中及时检查是提高运动的重要问题。黎城对西井、南委泉等基点的检查，对全县冬季生产起了决定的推进作用。此外在运动中根据群众意见提出响亮的口号，对运动的刺激鼓舞也很大。如潞城辛安村动员生产时，提出：“纺花织布穿的暖，担脚运输零花不困难”，“纺织运输不负担，大家努力好好干”等。发现怕斗争思想时则提出：“不贪污，不恶霸，发财露头也不怕。”该村秋收后，自满情绪很严重，提出：“吃惯馋，坐惯懒，饿起肚子后悔晚”，“坐吃不动弹，吃山也有完”，这些口号都起了很大的作用。
