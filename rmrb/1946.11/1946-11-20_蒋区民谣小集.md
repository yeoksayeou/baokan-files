    Ballads from the KMT-Controlled Areas
    Luo Hong
    Busy in the morning, busy at night, busy from summer to autumn, after handing in the task and offering the grain, we have to measure what we eat.

    First afraid of drought, second afraid of floods, third afraid of locusts, fourth afraid of donations, fifth afraid of the army, fierce as tigers, sixth afraid of the yamen, with biased judgments, seventh afraid of conscription, eighth afraid of beatings, ninth afraid of the village head's exorbitant profits, mentioning fear, truly afraid, tenth afraid of having neither food nor clothing.

    Hitch up the ox, load the wheat, rumbling into the county granary, while elder brother starves in the threshing ground.

    Twelve thousand eight hundred is nothing, one hundred twenty thousand buys an ox, children of the next generation shouldn't farm, learn to print banknotes and you won't worry.

    蒋区民谣小集
    罗红
    早上忙，晚上忙，从夏忙，到秋忙，交了差事奉了粮，自己吃咧还得量。
    一怕旱，二怕淹，三怕蚂蚱，四怕捐，五怕军队凶如虎，六怕衙门评理偏，七怕征兵，八怕打，九怕保长大利钱，提起怕，实实怕，十怕没吃又没穿。
    套上牛，麦装上，咕咕噜噜进县仓，大哥饿在打麦场。
    万二八千算个球，一二十万买个牛，下辈孩子别种地，学会印票不发愁。
