Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, November 20th: According to various reports, the nationwide bituminous coal miners' strike has begun. Although the order from the coal miners' union chairman, Lewis, was for the strike to begin at midnight today and the government ordered a postponement of the strike, by the afternoon of the 19th, 45,000 of the 400,000 miners nationwide had walked out of the mines, urging the remaining miners to stop work before midnight today. Due to the strike, steel factories have made preparations, and railway transportation will reduce services from the 25th.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, November 22nd: According to various reports, as of noon on the 20th, 155,000 miners have been involved in the wave of the American coal mine strike. According to the Associated Press, this major strike will "inevitably cause industrial chaos" and "widespread unemployment." It is claimed that within two months, the following industries across the United States will be shut down due to coal shortages: 64 percent of power plants, 90 percent of coke, 16 percent of iron, 90 percent of cement plants, and approximately 70 percent of the automotive and other industries.

At this time of severe winter, this coal mine strike has a particularly large impact on national life, and the Truman government has been greatly embarrassed by it. Truman instructed the Department of Justice to sue Lewis, chairman of the Miners' Union, forcing him to cancel the notice he had made days prior that the miners' contract with the government had expired. The miners' work stoppage is based on this notice. It is reported that the government will arrest Lewis. In response, Stassen, one of the Republican leaders, telegraphed five other Republican leaders, asking them to support the Truman government's prosecution. Republican congressmen are also planning to pass anti-labor legislation in the future Congress, which has greatly angered the two American labor unions. The Congress of Industrial Organizations National Convention, which is being held in Atlantic City, resolved on the 20th to condemn the government's attitude towards Lewis; and leaders of the American Federation of Labor also believe that if the government punishes Lewis, it will be the end of cooperation between the government and the union. Leaders of 75,000 anthracite coal miners also stated on the 21st that if the government takes action against Lewis, they will hold a sympathy strike.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, November 22nd: Associated Press, Atlantic City (eastern United States): The Congress of Industrial Organizations annual meeting resolved on the 21st to launch a comprehensive wage increase campaign early next year. The annual meeting also resolved to strengthen organizational activities in the ten southern states, condemning the reactionary members of Congress who are obstructing this campaign.

　　美国爆发煤矿大罢工
    十五万余矿工卷入浪潮
    对全美生活影响重大杜鲁门政府大感窘迫
    【新华社延安二十日电】据各方报导：全美烟煤工人大罢工已开始，虽然煤矿工会主席路易斯的命令是在今日午夜开始罢工及政府下令延期罢工，但迄十九日下午，全美四十万矿工中已有四万五千人走出矿场，他们力促其余矿工在今日午夜前停工。由于罢工之故，钢铁工厂已预作准备，铁道交通亦将于廿五日起减少班次。
    【新华社延安二十二日电】据各方报导，迄二十日午止，已有十五万五千矿工卷入美国煤矿大罢工浪潮中。据合众社称：这一大罢工将“不可免的发生工业混乱”及“普遍失业”。据称，在两个月内，全美以下工业将因缺煤而停闭，即：电力厂的百分之六十四，焦煤百分之九十，铁百分之十六，士敏土厂百分之九十，汽车业及其他工业约百分之七十。
    际此隆冬，此煤矿大罢工对全国生活影响特大，杜鲁门政府已因此而甚为窘迫。杜氏曾指令司法部控告矿工联合会主席路易斯，迫其取消日前所作矿工与政府合同期满之通知。矿工停工即系根据此通知。据悉，政府将逮捕路氏。对此，共和党领袖之一史塔生致电其他五位共和党领袖，请他们支持杜鲁门政府此一控诉。共和党议员并筹划在未来国会中通过反劳工法案，美国两工会对此极为愤激。正在大西洋城召开之产业工会联合会全国代表大会，于二十日决议谴责政府对路易斯的态度；而美国劳工联合会领袖，亦认为倘政府惩办路易斯，便是政府与该工会之间合作终结。七万五千无烟煤矿工人领袖并于二十一日表示：如政府对路易斯采取行动，则将举行同情罢工。
    【新华社延安廿二日电】合众社大西洋城（美国东部）讯：美国产业工会联合会年会于二十一日决议，于明年初发动全面的增资运动。年会并决议将在南方十州加强组织活动，谴责反动的国会议员阻挠此项运动。
