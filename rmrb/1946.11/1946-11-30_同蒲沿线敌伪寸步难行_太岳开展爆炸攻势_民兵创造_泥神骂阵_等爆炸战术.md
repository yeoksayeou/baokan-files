　　Enemy and Puppet Forces Find It Difficult to Move Along the Tongpu Railway Line
    Taiyue Launches a Bombing Offensive
    Militiamen Create Explosion Tactics Such as "Mud God Scolding Formation"
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch of the 28th] North from Pingyao to the vast area along the Yellow River, demolition teams have launched a broad offensive. They have invented offensive demolition tactics such as "Mud God Scolding Formation," "Good Luck Opening the Door," and "Flying Explosion," creating a state of extreme fear and difficulty of movement for the Kuomintang army. Preliminary statistics for October show that in Pingyao, from the 18th to the end of the month, enemy troops were killed or wounded 30 times in Changze, Yuebi, and Gele Forts, and two mules were injured; in Huo County, from the 15th to the 29th, there were six explosions in Zhidong, Zhangjiazhuang, Duanzhuang, Nandong Village, and other places, killing or wounding 24 enemy soldiers. In Hongtong, from October 6th to 16th, there were four explosions in the back homes and other places in the city, killing seven enemy soldiers below the platoon leader level. In the latter half of October, in Fushan, more than 20 enemy soldiers below the platoon leader level were killed or wounded. In Yicheng, on October 29th, two enemy soldiers below the company commander level were killed. The bombing results in Wenxi, Xia County, Pinglu, and other counties are still being investigated. The Jiyuan shimin militia expeditionary force detonated mines five times, killing or wounding 14 enemy soldiers and destroying one enemy machine gun, for a total of 102 enemy soldiers killed or wounded below the company commander level.
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch of the 28th] In the self-defense war to protect their homes and lives and to protect the fruits of their liberation over the past three months, the militiamen along the Tongpu Railway Line in our Tenth and Ninth Military Sub-districts have continuously inflicted great damage on the invading Chiang Kai-shek troops through ambushes, harassing attacks, and encirclements, and have repeatedly combined with guerrilla forces to smash the Chiang Kai-shek troops' "encirclement and suppression" and "sweeping." This vigorous self-defense guerrilla war is even more tense and fierce in Hong, Zhao, Xiangling, and other places. The "encirclement and suppression" Chiang Kai-shek troops always carry out deceptive and enticing propaganda on the one hand during each "sweeping," and on the other hand, they carry out mass burning, killing, and looting to intimidate the peasants, in an attempt to achieve their goal of making the people lay down their self-defense weapons; however, the broad masses of the people have seen through the Chiang Kai-shek troops' conspiracy from their own pain, and have launched a movement to protect their villages in Hong and Zhao. In Xiangling, a county-wide militia oath-taking movement was launched, "Swearing to never surrender," to respond to and smash the Chiang Kai-shek troops' four "encirclement and suppression" campaigns in Xiangling with tenacious fighting. Yao Dongshan, the people's leader in Xiangling, led a guerrilla group with great confidence to carry out guerrilla warfare within the enemy's "encirclement and suppression network," never leaving Xiangling and fighting to this day. Not a single militiaman surrendered. Under their influence, the peasants poured into their armed militia rotation teams, demolition groups, guerrilla groups, and the militiamen of various counties, becoming stronger and stronger in battle. The number of militia arms has more than doubled compared to three months ago, and weapons have increased fourfold. In the three months from August to October, they fought with the Chiang Kai-shek troops more than 380 times, killing or wounding more than 384 enemy soldiers and capturing 38 enemy soldiers. They seized one rocket launcher, one mortar, ten light and heavy machine guns, 188 long and short guns, four Sten submachine guns, more than 300 kilograms of electrical wire, and more than 4,000 rounds of ammunition. The counties are now launching a decentralized guerrilla war based on explosions.

    民兵创造“泥神骂阵”等爆炸战术
    【本报太岳二十八日电】北起平遥，南至黄河边的广大地区上，爆炸手展开了广大的攻势，他们发明了进攻的爆炸战术，例如“泥神骂阵”、“开门大吉”、“飞行爆炸”等，造成了国民党军队的草木皆兵，寸步难行恐惧状态。十月份初步统计：平遥自十八日至月底十二天内，在常则、岳必、圪了堡炸死伤敌军三十名，炸伤骡两头；霍县自十五日至二十九日，在置东、张家庄、段庄、南东村等地爆炸六次，毙伤敌二十四名。洪洞自十月六日至十六日，于城内后家等地爆炸四次，炸毙敌排长以下七名。浮山十月份下半月，炸死炸伤敌排长以下二十余名。翼城于十月二十九日炸死敌连长以下二名。闻喜、夏县、平陆等县，爆炸战绩正清查中。在济源的士敏民兵远征队，炸雷五次，死伤敌十四名，炸毁敌机枪一挺，共计炸死伤敌连长以下一○二名。
    【本报太岳二十八日电】我十、九分区同蒲沿线民兵，在三个月来保卫家乡性命、保卫翻身果实的自卫战争中，对深入内地的蒋军，不断用阻击、袭扰、围困给进犯者以极大创伤，并屡次结合游击队粉碎了蒋军“清剿”与“扫荡”。这种如火如荼的自卫游击战争，在洪、赵、襄陵等地，更是紧张激烈，“清剿”的蒋军在每次“扫荡”时，总是一面进行欺骗利诱宣传，一面大肆烧杀抢劫来恐吓农民，以企图达到他们使人民放下自卫武器的目的；但广大的人民，从切身的痛苦中，已识破了蒋军的阴谋，在洪赵展开了保乡运动。在襄陵则展开了普及全县的民兵宣誓运动，“誓死不投降”，以顽强的战斗来回答与粉碎蒋军在襄陵的四次“清剿”。襄陵人民领袖姚东山极有信心地率领导游击小组，在敌人的“清剿网”内游击，始终没有离开襄陵一步，一直战斗到现在，没有一个民兵投降，农民在他们的影响下，涌入了自己的武装民兵轮战队、爆炸组、游击小组及各县的民兵，愈战愈强，民兵武装的数量已比三月前扩大一倍以上，武器则增加四倍。在八月至十月三个月的战斗中，共与蒋军作战三百八十余次，毙伤敌三百八十四名，俘敌三十八名。缴获火箭炮一门，迫击炮一门、轻重机枪十挺、长短枪一八八支、斯登式手提四支、电线三百余斤、子弹四千余发，现各县正展开以爆炸为主分散的游击战争。
