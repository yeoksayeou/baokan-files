　　How to Reorganize Yongzhi Tianzhuang
    Ji'nan Branch
    After Yongzhi Tianzhuang completed the distribution of fruits and the removal of "traitor hats," it turned to reorganizing its structure. Except for the formal establishment of the Village Political Committee and the Village Armed Committee, the reorganization of other organizations has basically concluded. The reorganization generally went through the following process: The Farmers' Association originally had 186 members, including 40 middle peasants, 144 poor peasants, and 2 rich peasants. It was divided into 17 groups, with 34 group leaders (each group had a leader and a deputy leader). After struggle and testing, only 18 of the group leaders were found to be competent. The division of the groups was also often inappropriate, such as the 15th group with ten members, three old men, three young men, and the remaining four were fathers and sons.

    Before starting the reorganization, the content and spirit of the reorganization were determined. In addition to re-dividing the groups, re-electing incompetent group leaders, and establishing committees, the main focus was on examining thinking, strengthening education, consolidating unity, and reviewing everyone's attitude towards the landlords during the anti-traitor and grievance-airing process, inspiring everyone to expose, criticize, and examine each other. Initially, a joint meeting of group leaders was held to discuss the standards for dividing the groups, stipulating the principle of "mixing new and old members" and "distributing backbone members." During the ideological examination, the director and deputy director first made self-criticism reports. The deputy director reflected that when struggling against Tian Menglan, he was unwilling to call on the masses of Wangpai to participate in airing grievances, fearing that villagers from other villages would share the fruits, and his understanding of "the poor all over the world are one family" was insufficient. Zhao Shiqi, the group leader of the 10th group, reflected that he did not shout slogans when struggling against the landlord, fearing offending people. The group leader of the 15th group reflected that he was not diligent enough and tended to follow the crowd when discussing issues. Finally, the director of the Farmers' Association recounted the crimes of the landlords, and the village chief called on the middle peasants to live a stable and hardworking life. After the group leaders finished their self-criticism, they led their group members in self-criticism. Village cadres and district cadres participated in each group with a focus to understand the members' thinking. It was found that some members had a paralyzing mentality, believing that the landlords would no longer counterattack; others had a vague class consciousness, believing that landlords also had good humanity and could participate in the Farmers' Association. Six members of the 10th group, none of them knew that middle and poor peasants should become one family. After the group self-criticism, the specific division of groups and the formation of the committee were studied. At the members' meeting, the groups were re-divided according to the original plan, group leaders were elected, and a committee of seven people was formed, including five poor peasants and two middle peasants.

    After the reorganization of the Farmers' Association, the original 17 groups were reorganized into 15. Each group still had a leader and a deputy leader. Among the 30 group leaders, 10 were middle peasants and 20 were poor peasants. Among them, 10 were young people, 17 were adults, and 3 were elderly. Twenty-four had participated in the livelihood struggle, and six had participated in the anti-traitor and grievance-airing struggle. Most of the new group leaders were active and tenacious in the struggle. After this reorganization, internal unity was greatly improved. In the past, the director of the Farmers' Association and the village chief were very disunited, but now they have admitted their mistakes to each other. Other comrades also raised some opinions, and the relationship has greatly improved.

    Previously, the militia had not developed, and the morale of the members was low because many problems of the militia itself had not been resolved. At the self-criticism meeting, the members raised to the cadres that two people were often on duty every day, waiting to be used, and had to stand guard at night, so they could not do the work at home and had to go hungry. After studying these situations, it was decided to abolish the duty system and reduce some tasks of the self-defense force and the militia so as not to affect production. The leadership strengthened the education of the militia, and the morale of the militia immediately stabilized. The leadership further guided the militia to reflect on incidents of violating mass discipline. The method was to chat during evening breaks, and then make formal confessions at the meeting, which also achieved many results. At the same time, some people's concerns about participating in the militia, such as delaying work and conscription, were dispelled. It was clarified that the militia is an armed force to protect the home and fields, and village cadres and activists should play a model role by participating themselves or calling on their children to participate in the militia. After the ideological problems were resolved, the militia organization is now developing and growing.

　　永智田庄如何整理组织
    冀南分社
    永智田庄在分配果实、摘汉奸帽进行完竣后，即转向整理组织。除村政委员会和村武委会没有正式建立外，其他组织整理已告结束。整理中大体经过以下的过程：农会原有会员一百八十六名，包括中农四十名，贫农一百四十四名，富农二名。划分为十七个组，组长三十四名。（每组均有正副组长）经过斗争考验，发现称职的组长只十八名。小组的划分上，也多不合适，如第十五组十个组员，三个老头，三个青年，其余四个是父子爷们。
    未着手整理前，确定了整理的内容与精神，除重新划分小组，改选不称职的组长，建立委员会外，主要是检查思想，加强教育，巩固团结，检讨反奸诉苦中每一个人对地主的态度，启发大家互相揭发、批评、检查。开始先召开组长联席会，讨论出划组标准。规定“新旧会员混合编”，“骨干分子分布开”的原则，在思想检查中，正副主任先作反省报告。副主任反省出自己在斗争田梦兰时，不愿意叫王湃群众参加诉苦，怕外村分走果实，对“天下穷人是一家。”认识不够。第十组组长赵世琪反省出在斗争地主时不喊口号，怕得罪人。第十五组组长反省出尽职不够。讨论问题时好随大流。最后农会主任陈述地主的罪恶，村长号召中农安心努力过日子。组长反省结束，分组带领组员反省，村干部和区干部有重点的参加各组了解会员的思想。发现部分会员，存在着麻痹思想，认为地主已不会再反攻；另有一些会员阶级意识模糊，认为地主也有人性好的，可以参加农会。第十组六个组员，没有一人知道中贫农应该成为一家的。小组反省后，又研究具体划组，委员会的产生等问题。在会员大会上，按原定计划重新划分了小组，选了组长，产生了七个人的委员会，其中贫农五、中农二。
    农会整理后，原来十七个组，编为十五个。每组仍设正副组长各一。三十个组长中，中农十人，贫农二十人。其中青年十人，壮年十七人，老年三人。参加过民生斗争的二十四人，参加过反奸诉苦斗争的六人。新组长多半是在斗争中表现积极顽强的。经过这次整理，内部团结大进一步。过去农会主任与村长很不团结，现已互相认了错。其他同志也提了些意见，关系大为好转。
    以前民兵没有发展，队员情绪低落。原因是民兵本身有很多问题没解决。在反省会上，队员向干部提出每天经常有两个人值班，听候使用，夜里还得站岗放哨，家里的活不能干，还得饿肚。根据这些情况研究后，决定取消值班制度，减轻自卫队与民兵的若干任务，使不影响生产。领导上加强民兵的教育，民兵情绪立即转趋稳定。领导上进一步引导民兵反省违犯群众纪律的事件。办法是趁晚间休息时闲扯，然后在会上做正式坦白，也获得不少成绩，与此同时解除了一部分人怕参加民兵要误工、要拔兵等顾虑。明确了民兵是保家保田的武装，村干部积极分子应起模范作用，自己参加，或叫自己的子弟参加民兵。思想问题解决后，民兵组织现已在发展壮大中。
