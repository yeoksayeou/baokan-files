　　Soviet Commentator Yevgeny Claims: U.S. Reactionaries' Smear of Soviet Aircraft Attacking Antung is to Cover Up Their Own Expansion of Aggression Against China
　　(Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 26th) Moscow, 25th Broadcast: Soviet commentator Yevgeny, commenting on foreign news agencies' reports of six Soviet aircraft bombing Kuomintang military in Antung, Manchuria, rebuked the U.S. reactionary group as the source of this rumor, pointing out that the U.S. reactionaries spread this rumor in order to cover up their own expansion of power in China, to cover up their interference in China's internal affairs and economy, and to cover up their assistance to the Kuomintang reactionaries' struggle against Chinese democratic forces. Yevgeny pointed out that rumor-mongering and slander are the so-called "freedom of the press" in the United States, and the U.S. State Department is helping to spread this slander.

　　苏评论员叶夫根尼称：美反动派诬苏机袭安东是掩盖它自己扩大侵华
    【新华社延安二十六日电】莫斯科二十五日广播：苏评议员叶夫根尼评外国通讯社所传六架苏机轰炸满洲安东国民党军事，斥美反动集团为此一谣言的来源，指出美反动派所以散布此种谣言，目的乃在掩盖自己在中国扩张势力，掩盖自己干涉中国内政和经济，掩盖他们帮助国民党反动派反对中国民主力量的斗争。叶夫根尼指出造谣诽谤，即美国的所谓“新闻自由”，美国务院则帮助这种诽谤的传布。
