Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd: Hankou Dispatch: Liu Bali, former director of the political department of a certain division of the Youth Army and chief writer for the Saodang Bao, published an article entitled "Gleanings from the Capital" in the Heping Daily here on the 13th, revealing the darkness, corruption, and signs of national doom of the Nanjing rulers. The article stated: "Signing in, reading the newspaper, smoking, chatting - these few words describe the boring life of a petty civil servant... They are oppressed by the burdens of firewood, rice, oil, and salt... even the worst cigarettes have to be smoked in bags to numb their nerves, because the more numb this world is, the better. But the extravagant life of the "big civil servants" really makes you wonder if China has already progressed to the 21st century... Some of them have at least several large and small mansions between Nanjing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Suzhou. The panic over housing in the Nanjing and Shanghai areas is because they have occupied too many. They equip some large and small mistresses in convenient locations, and on Saturdays or Sundays, they travel to these places for pleasure. In each of the large and small mansions, there are at least twenty or thirty servants and seven or eight cars. When I see these "American crawlers" (referring to cars), especially Jeeps, it's as if I see this place about to become a battlefield. I imagine that in a few years, or not long after, this battlefield will have an unimaginable effect, and I feel chilled! Many imported goods, canned goods, paper, cloth, etc., are displayed on the streets of Nanjing. Although the police are driving away the vendors, why not drive away the large vendors?... Foreign goods are flooding in, and the entire industry and commerce is about to go bankrupt, and agriculture will be even more depressed. Anyway, those higher comprador classes and bureaucratic capitalists already have millions in their pockets, so what are they afraid of the country's survival?"

　　买办官僚荒淫无耻
    前蒋军“青年军”一政治部主任也看不顺眼
    【新华社延安三日电】汉口讯：前青年军某师政治部主任及扫荡报主笔刘拔藜，十三日在此间和平日报发表“京中掇拾”一文，透露南京统治者的黑暗腐败和亡国的气象。该文称：“签签到，看看报，抽抽烟，谈谈天——这几句话，描写了小公务员的无聊生活。……他们为柴米油盐压迫……，就是最劣等的烟也得熏上几袋，用以麻醉自己的神经，因为这个世界越被麻醉越好。但是“大公务员”的纸醉金迷生活，真要使你怀疑到中国现已进步到二十一世纪了……，他们有的最少在京沪杭苏之间，摆几个大小公馆，京沪一带房屋的恐慌，就是因为他们霸占的太多了。他们设备一些大小的太太，在交通便利之地，在星期六或星期日，他们便往来这些地方作乐。他们在各大小公馆之中，至少有二三十名，听差汽车总是七八辆以上。我看见这些“美式爬虫”（指汽车），尤其是吉普车，仿佛看见这里快要变成阵地。我怀想若干年或不久之后，这个阵地要发生不可思议的作用，于是我寒心了！有许多的舶来品、罐头、纸张、布匹等摆在南京街头，虽然警察在驱逐贩卖者，然而为什么不驱逐大贩卖者呢……。外货闯进来了，整个工商业快要破产了，农业更要不景气了，反正那些高等买办阶级与官僚资本家他们已经腰缠千万，还恐惧什么国家存亡呢！”
