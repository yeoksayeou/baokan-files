　　Xingtai New District Two Hundred Villages
    Initially Complete Land Reform
    [This newspaper Xingtai News] After the land reform movement since July in this county, the principle of land to the tiller has been initially realized. In the new district of 256 villages, farmers have overthrown landlords and recovered more than 100,000 mu of land. After the movement, tenant farmers and poor peasants in the east of the road have an average of more than four mu of land per person (mostly irrigated land), and those in the west of the road have more than ten mu (mostly dry land). Before July, due to the leadership's lack of boldness, the masses felt that the struggle was not satisfactory, and "using a cannon to kill a grasshopper would not pay off," and they could not turn over. The movement was depressed for a long time. After review, it was clarified that the feudal system should be thoroughly eliminated to meet the land requirements of farmers. The leadership let go of the reins, and the movement spread like wildfire throughout the county. Tenant farmers and poor peasants united with middle peasants to launch a struggle against local bullies and landlords. The masses carried out liquidation and venting of grievances day and night, exposing the crimes of treacherous and domineering landlords. Wherever they went, the masses struggled against them. Some treacherous and domineering landlords attempted to deny and refused to hand over guns and stolen goods, but under the mass debt collection movement, they were forced to hand them over. When the masses exhibited the fruits of victory, livestock and grain were arranged like a market, and paper mache treacherous and domineering landlords were placed all over the streets. Propagandists explained separately the process of obtaining the fruits and the criminal facts of the treacherous and domineering landlords, as well as the process of the masses overthrowing them. The masses' class consciousness and fighting spirit have been increasingly improved. In the past, old men and women who were afraid of trouble also encouraged their children to participate in the struggle, and backward farmers also joined the movement one after another.

　　邢台新区二百余村
    初步完成土地改革
    【本报邢台讯】本县经过七月以来的土地改革运动，初步实现了耕者有其田，全新区二百五十六村，农民打垮地主收回土地十万亩以上。运动后，路东雇佃贫农平均每人有地四亩多（水地多），路西在十亩以上（旱地多）。在七月前由于领导上不放手，群众认为斗争不解气，“大枪打蚂蚱倒赔了本”，翻不了身，运动曾长时期消沉。经过检讨，明确彻底消灭封建，满足农民土地要求，领导上放开了手，运动即如烈火一样地在全县开展起来。雇佃贫农团结着中农一齐向恶霸地主展开斗争，群众不分白天黑夜的进行清算、诉苦，揭发奸霸地主的罪恶，他们跑到那里群众斗到那里，有的奸霸地主妄图抵赖不肯吐出枪支赃物，但在群众性的要账运动下，都被迫吐了出来。群众展览胜利果实时，牲口、粮食排列像集市，纸糊的恶霸地主等摆满街头，宣传员分头讲解获得果实的过程和恶霸地主的罪恶事实及群众斗倒他的经过。群众的阶级觉悟和斗争情绪均愈益提高，过去怕事的老头老婆们也鼓励自己的孩子参加斗争，落后农民也纷纷卷入运动。
