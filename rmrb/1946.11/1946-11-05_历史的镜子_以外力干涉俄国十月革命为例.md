    ——Taking Foreign Intervention in the Russian October Revolution as an Example

    "British uniforms,
    French epaulettes,
    Japanese tobacco,
    The Omsk Supreme Ruler.
    The uniforms are worn out,
    The epaulettes have fallen off,
    The tobacco is all smoked,
    The Supreme Ruler is gone."
    In the winter of 1919, such a folk song was sung from the mouths of the people of Siberia, the song was light, and their hearts were also light. Because, Kolchak, the "Omsk Supreme Ruler" who relied on the support of foreign imperialism to attack the Soviet regime, was finally captured and executed by the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army.
    After World War I, the imperialists, fearing the new people's regime, blockaded and besieged the Soviet Union, carrying out armed intervention in various ways. They took a fancy to the White Russian Kolchak, placed him in the city of Omsk, and declared him the "Supreme Ruler of Russia." Kolchak also felt "very honored" to prostrate himself at the feet of the imperialists, acting as a puppet emperor.
    In the spring of 1919, he put all his troops on the front lines to attack the Soviet regime, occupying many areas, almost reaching the Volga River. Just as he and his masters were happily congratulating themselves on a great victory, the excellent Bolshevik Party members led the Red Army in launching a counter-offensive, and the worker-peasant youths were mobilized, bravely rushing to the front lines to fight against the counter-revolutionary forces. Kolchak began a full-scale retreat as soon as he encountered the Red Army's counter-attack. The Red Army continued to expand powerfully, and with the cooperation of a strong guerrilla war in the rear of the White Army, the Urals and Siberia were liberated. At the end of the year, Kolchak's army was completely crushed. The foreign armed interventionists then supported another counter-revolutionary dog, Denikin; and under the brilliant command of Comrade Stalin, Denikin was finally annihilated. Later, the interventionists gave tanks, planes, and ammunition to Wrangel, and he was finally driven by the Red Army to the Crimean Peninsula, where he was annihilated.
    The law of historical progress is inviolable. All foreign intervention and "Supreme Rulers" who falsely claim authority to eliminate the revolutionary people's regime and party are impossible. Chiang Kai-shek, the head of the Chinese reactionaries, although helped by the American reactionaries, desperately attacked the Liberated Areas, and his final fate will certainly be the same as that of Kolchak and his ilk. One day, the Chinese people will also sing like this:
    "American uniforms,
    American epaulettes,
    American cigarettes,
    The "Alabama Ningbo" Supreme Ruler.
    The uniforms are worn out,
    The epaulettes are gone,
    The tobacco is all smoked,
    The Supreme Ruler is gone."
    This is the mirror of history.

　　历史的镜子
    ——以外力干涉俄国十月革命为例
    燕凌
    “英国的军装，
    法国的肩章，
    日本的烟草，
    鄂木斯克的执政王。
    军装穿破了，
    肩章掉落了，
    烟草吸完了，
    执政王滚蛋了。”
    一九一九年冬天，从西伯利亚人民口中唱出了这样一首歌谣，歌声是轻快的，他们的心头也是轻快的。因为，靠着外国帝国主义撑腰向苏维埃政权进攻的“鄂木斯克的执政王”——高尔察克终于被工农红军捉住枪毙了。
    第一次世界大战以后，帝国主义者们害怕新生的人民的政权，对苏联封锁、围攻，用种种方式进行武装干涉。他们看中了白俄高尔察克，把他安置在鄂木斯克城，宣布他为“俄国最高执政”。高尔察克也就自以为“非常荣幸”的匍匐在帝国主义者群的脚下，做起儿皇帝来了。
    一九一九年春天，他把所有的军队都投入向苏维埃政权进攻的前线，侵占了不少地区，几乎进展到伏尔加河。正当他和他的主子们兴高采烈地自以为得到了大胜利的时候，优秀的布尔塞维克党员们领导着红军发动了反攻，工农青年都动员了起来，勇敢的奔赴与反革命势力搏斗的最前线。高尔察克一遭遇红军的反击就开始全线总退却，红军继续强有力的扩展，在白军后方强大游击战争的配合下，把乌拉尔和西伯利亚解放了。年末，高尔察克的军队就被完全粉碎。外国武装干涉者又扶植起另一个反革命的走狗邓尼金；而在斯大林同志的天才指挥下，邓尼金也终于被消灭。以后干涉者又把坦克飞机弹药给了佛兰盖尔，而他也终于被红军赶到克里姆半岛上，被消灭在那里。
    历史进展的规律是不可违犯的，一切的外力干涉和狐假虎威的“执政王”想消灭革命的人民政权和政党是不可能的。中国反动派的头子蒋介石，虽然有美国反动派的帮助，拚命向解放区进攻，最后的命运也一定和高尔察克之流一样。终有一天中国人民也要这样唱：
    “美国的军装，
    美国的肩章，
    美国的香烟，
    “阿拉宁波”的执政王。
    军装穿烂了，
    肩章不见了，
    烟草吸完了，
    执政王滚蛋了。”
    这就是历史的镜子。
