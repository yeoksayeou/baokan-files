　　Zhang Jinfang, Heroic Enemy Killer
    Luo Cuntian
    "The defense of Zuozhuang (at the center of the Heju Highway) was excellent, Comrade Zhang Jinfang was the most outstanding!" This is what Instructor Duan Nan said, and he added in the end: "This comrade is really good!" His words contained great admiration and infinite love.
    Comrade Jinfang, only in his twenties, a fine young man, is a machine gun ammunition carrier in the first squad. In mid-July, during a long march, sores grew on his feet, but he still carried five or six hundred rounds of ammunition, and even the machine gun. When he saw the small gunner go to "relieve himself," he even carried the small cannon, often carrying forty or fifty pounds without complaint. As soon as they settled down, he immediately cooked and carried water, busy without stopping.
    This time, during the defense of Zuozhuang, his machine gun repelled two fierce enemy attacks on the northwest corner. During the first attack at three o'clock in the afternoon, the enemy began to charge again. Unexpectedly, his machine gun malfunctioned. Because there was only this machine gun on the northwest corner, while one person repaired it, he borrowed a rifle and a few grenades from the second squad, lying in ambush on the northwest corner, taking careful aim and firing cold shots. The enemy's artillery fire was very intense, and his leg was wounded. Ammunition penetrated his flesh, and blood spurted from the inch-wide wound like a spring, soaking his trousers. He jumped up and shouted loudly, "Good kid, you actually injured me, good! I'll have to find a few of you to die with me!" Saying this, he stood on a machine gun emplacement destroyed by artillery fire and shot. An enemy machine gun was only fifty meters away from him. With just three shots, he silenced the enemy machine gun. He shouted while firing, "Comrades, stay calm, if the kid comes up, fight him with bayonets. Don't think I'm wounded, I can still take on at least three or two of them." The enemy's artillery fire became more and more fierce, and dirt flew around him in gusts, but he shot without panic. This unparalleled bravery encouraged everyone! He even shouted to the enemy, "Surrender your guns, surrendering your guns will spare you!" At this time, the enemy was close to him, and he fired ten or so grenades in one breath, causing the enemy to roll and crawl back. This one blow killed five enemies. When the enemy was far away, he again took careful aim and fired cold shots.
    After repelling the enemy's third charge, the instructor came over and saw that the blood on Zhang Jinfang's leg was constantly running down and reddening his trousers, so he gave him a bandage and said, "Tie it up a bit!" He immediately said, "It doesn't matter, instructor, it doesn't matter if it's more serious!" He didn't wrap it, and limped to the front to monitor the enemy. Not long after, the enemy blew the charge! A burst of shouting: "Charge! Charge, charge," but no one dared to raise their head, only the artillery fire was very fierce. This was "artillery fire charge," the masterpiece of the "direct line of the direct line, the elite of the elite," the American-equipped Chiang's army that had campaigned in Burma with the strongest combat effectiveness. Jinfang saw through it, and couldn't help but laugh in his heart, saying, "Good kid, have the guts to come up!" At this time, he heard the Chiang's army over there clamoring, "Grenades, we can't stand it!"
    Zhang Jinfang bled for more than three hours, repelling the enemy who rolled back again and again. It was getting dark. Under the repeated urging of the instructor and the squad leader, he limped off to stop the bleeding. When asked to drop his weapons, he wanted two grenades: "If the enemy comes up again, I will fight him!" The brave man's medicine had just been applied when the enemy's artillery fire rang out again. Jinfang's anger was unbearable, and he said to the instructor, "Give me grenades, I'll go and charge again!" As a result, there was another artillery fire "charge," and he finally calmed down. After the battle, at the company's hero election meeting, Jinfang was elected as the number one enemy-killing hero.

　　杀敌英雄张金芳
    罗村田
    “左庄（在荷巨公路中心点）守的好，张金芳同志是最出色的!”这是指导员段南同志说的，他最后更加一句：“这个同志，真好！”话里包含着十分赞佩和无限的爱慕。
    金芳同志，才二十多岁，好样的青年小伙子，是一班的机枪弹药手。七月中，在长途行军中，他的脚长疮、可是他照样还是扛五、六百发子弹，还扛机枪。他看见小炮手“解手”去了，就连小炮也扛上走，经常身上四五十斤不嫌重，一住下来，马上便做饭担水，忙个不休。
    这次坚守左庄，他的机枪在西北角上连打退敌人两次猛攻，在第一次下午三点钟时候敌人又开始冲锋，不料他的机枪发生故障了，因为西北角只有这挺机枪，就一面由一个人修理，他在二班借枝步枪和几个手榴弹，伏在西北角上瞄的准准的打冷枪。敌人炮火打得很紧，他的腿挂了彩，弹药钻进肉里了，一寸宽的血口中血如泉涌一样的向裤子上冒，他跳起来，大声的叫：“好小子，你竟打伤了老子，好！非找你几个垫背的不行！”说着，便站在一个被炮火摧毁的机枪工事上打，敌人一挺机枪离他只五十米远，他只三枪，便把敌人机枪打成“哑吧”了，他边打边喊：“同志们，沉住气，小子上来，就和他拚刺刀，别看我挂彩了，至少还拚他三个两个的。”敌炮愈打愈烈、烟土在他身边一股股的飞扬，他却毫不惊慌的射击，这无比的英勇，鼓着大家的勇气！他更向敌人喊：“快交枪吧，交了枪不杀！”这时敌人快到他跟前了，他一口气打了十来个手榴弹，打得敌人连爬带滚的往回翻，这一家伙把敌人打死五个。敌人离远了，他又是瞄的准准的打冷枪。
    把敌人第三次冲锋打垮以后，指导员过来见张金芳腿上的血不断的流红了裤子，便给他一条绷带说：“你捆住些！”他紧接着说：“不要紧，指导员，再重点也没关系！”他没裹，一拐一拐的上前面去监视敌人。不多一会，敌人又吹冲锋号了！一阵乱叫：“冲！快冲、快冲”，但一个人也不敢抬起头来，只是炮火打得挺凶，这是“炮火冲”，这就是“嫡系的嫡系，精锐的精锐”，远征过缅甸战斗力最强的美式蒋军的杰作。金芳看透了，心里忍不住好笑说：“好小子，有种上来呀！”这时，听到蒋军那边乱吵吵说：“手榴弹，吃不住！”
    张金芳血流了三点多钟了，冲的敌人一次又一次跌跌爬爬的滚回去了，天快黑了，在指导员和班副的再三督促下，他才一颠一拐的止血去，叫他把武器丢下，他要两个手榴弹：“敌人再上来，我还要给他拚！”勇士的药刚上好，敌人的炮火又打响了，金芳的怒火捺不住，他向指导员说：“给我手榴弹，我还去冲！”结果，又是一次炮火“冲锋”，他这才安静下来。战罢归来，中队的英雄选举大会上，金芳被选为杀敌英雄头一名。
