　　[This Dispatch from our Newspaper in Weixian, 16th] In the Yuan Dynasty, the militia was rapidly expanded during the land investigation movement. Over ten thousand liberated peasants have joined the militia to protect their land. During the investigation and reduction, they: 1. Prominently put forward the slogan of developing the militia to enlighten the masses' armed consciousness and create a surge in joining the militia. To enlighten and educate the masses to complete the task of developing the militia, slogans such as "Liberated masses should arm themselves to protect the fruits of struggle and protect the land, arm themselves to repel the offensive of Big Old Chiang and suppress the activities of Little Old Chiang; outstanding young adults, Party members, and members should join the militia" were put forward, which greatly enlightened the masses on the role of participating in the militia. After the masses in Beiguan Village were liberated, the village cadres called on the masses at a mass meeting: Let's rise up to protect the land and strike at Big and Small Old Chiang. This was met with enthusiastic response, and the number of people who signed up to join the militia on the spot exceeded twice the original number of militia members. 2. All the cadres of the Armed Forces Committee participated in the land investigation movement, creating experience in combining the development of the militia while deeply mobilizing the masses, thus effectively promoting the role of the entire development of the militia. The specific methods of development: 1. First arm the advanced activists, and then mobilize and lead the masses to participate. 2. Mobilize members to join the militia through the Peasants' Representative Conference. 3. The militia develops the militia, and the cadres lead the masses to participate. 4. Individual mobilization and networking to participate.

　　元朝经过查减民兵发展一万
    【本报威县十六日电】元朝在查减运动中迅速扩大民兵，一万以上的翻身农民已涌入民兵队，参加了保卫土地的行列。他们在查减中：一、响亮的提出发展民兵的口号，以启发群众武装自觉，造成参加民兵的热潮。为启发教育群众完成发展民兵的任务，提出“翻身群众武装起来保卫斗争果实、保卫土地，武装起来打退大老蒋的进攻，镇压小老蒋的活动；优秀的青壮年、党员、会员参加民兵”等口号，启发群众参加民兵的作用很大。北馆村群众翻身之后，村干部在群众大会上号召：大家起来保卫土地，打击大小老蒋。得到热烈响应，当场报名参加民兵的超过原有民兵人数的一倍。二、武委会干部全部参加了查减运动，在深入发动群众中创造结合发展民兵经验，因而有效的推动整个发展民兵的作用。发展的具体办法：１、首先武装先进的积极分子，再动员和带领群众参加。２、通过农代会动员会员参加民兵。３、民兵发展民兵，干部带领群众参加。４、个别动员，串联参加。
