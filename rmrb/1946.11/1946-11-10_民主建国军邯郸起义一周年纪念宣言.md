Declaration on the First Anniversary of the Handan Uprising of the Democratic National Construction Army

　　Today, October 30th, the 35th year of the Republic of China, is the first anniversary of the Handan Uprising of our army, and also the first anniversary of our army's withdrawal from the civil war after the end of the Anti-Japanese War.

　　On this day last year, our army, on the banks of the Fuyang River, raised the banner of anti-civil war, striving for peace, anti-dictatorship, and striving for democracy, withdrawing from the civil war vortex and returning to the people's side. This great righteous act not only gave the Kuomintang reactionaries a head-on blow, provided strong assistance to the democratic camp, and opened up a bright road for the Kuomintang officers and soldiers forced to engage in the civil war, but also played a very important role in Chinese history. Therefore, this great day will always be celebrated and commemorated by the people of the whole country and the officers and soldiers of our army.

　　What is the purpose of our Handan Uprising? Simply put, it is for the independence, democracy, peace and prosperity of the motherland. The facts we have seen and experienced in the past year have proved that our goals are completely consistent with the demands of the people of the whole country, and the road to national salvation we have chosen is completely correct, and we must continue to move forward along this road in the future.

　　In the past year, we have seen more clearly the hideous faces and vicious hearts of the Sino-US reactionaries. The Chinese reactionaries have abandoned faith, broken their word, torn up the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and the ceasefire order, insisted on dictatorship, attacked the people, and even sold out the country for aid, offering all the rights of our motherland's territory, airspace, territorial waters and inland river navigation to the American reactionaries, willingly serving as slaves to the American reactionaries. Under the dark rule of this group of warlords and bureaucrats, tens of thousands of people were starved to death, and countless national industries were destroyed. The American reactionaries, with their overt and covert assistance, have become the root cause of the expansion of our country's civil war. In the past year, American troops stationed in China have committed acts of rape, plunder, smuggling and murder in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and other places, all of which are no different from the behavior of the Japanese troops in Tianjin before the "July 7th" Incident. Rejecting the tiger at the front gate and letting the wolf in through the back gate, thinking of this, we are filled with indignation! On the occasion of commemorating the first anniversary of the Handan Uprising, we would like to solemnly express to the people of the whole country: for the independence, democracy, peace and prosperity of the motherland, we resolutely oppose the Chinese reactionaries' treasonous act of colluding with imperialism to attack the people, resolutely oppose the United States' fueling of China's civil war, resolutely oppose the long-term stationing of American troops in China, and resolutely oppose the American robber conspiracy to turn China into an American colony. We extend our utmost sympathy and warm support to the Week of Withdrawal from China Movement held in 35 major cities in the United States, and the movements launched in Shanghai, Chongqing, Yan'an, Guangzhou and other places demanding the withdrawal of American troops from China.

　　In the past year, we have further realized that the Liberated Areas belong to the common people. The Liberated Areas have truly implemented the policy of "land to the tillers," so that the people have food to eat, clothes to wear, no thieves, and no beggars. The people in the Liberated Areas generally have political awareness and national consciousness. It can be said that the people in the Liberated Areas already have the qualifications of masters. The civil and military officials in the Liberated Areas are generally not afraid of death, do not love money, and do not care about their own interests, but serve the people wholeheartedly. It can be said that the officials in the Liberated Areas are worthy of the title of public servants of the people. Therefore, we cannot but admit that the Liberated Areas are the world of the people, and the place where the Three People's Principles are truly implemented. However, the Sino-US reactionaries regard this piece of clean land as a thorn in their side, and are determined to destroy and eliminate it, and their madness is simply inhuman. On the occasion of commemorating the first anniversary of the Handan Uprising, we would like to solemnly express to the people of the whole country: in order to maintain justice and righteousness, we resolutely oppose the Sino-US reactionaries' attack on the Liberated Areas, and resolutely oppose the Sino-US reactionaries' destruction of the people's regime that truly implements the Three People's Principles.

　　In the past year, we have further experienced the greatness of the people's strength and further confirmed that the democratic forces cannot be ignored. The officers and soldiers of our army have personally seen the high morale of the troops in the Liberated Areas, the enthusiastic participation of the people in the army, the successive efforts of democratic人士 throughout the country for the cause of peace and democracy, and the unstoppable tide of opposition to the Sino-US reactionaries. The Chinese reactionaries, on the other hand, have lost both popular support and military support, and are in crisis and showing signs of defeat. If it were not for the American reactionaries' blood transfusions and encouragement, they would be on the verge of collapse. Those who gain the Tao prosper, and those who lose the Tao perish; those who gain the people prosper, and those who lose the people perish. This is an unchanging iron rule throughout history. Therefore, if the Chinese reactionaries today are still obsessed with their own ways and continue to implement their policies of selling out the country, dictatorship and continuing the civil war, their final result will inevitably be the tragic fate of playing with fire and burning themselves.

　　All patriotic people who are fighting for national democracy! Let us unite more closely! The sacred mission urges us, and the confidence of victory inspires us. We must be unyielding and fight to the end, and we firmly believe that our cause will surely succeed, and a new China of independence, peace, democracy and prosperity will surely be realized.

　　Taking this opportunity, we would like to extend our sincere advice to the officers and soldiers of the Kuomintang army who are forced to engage in the civil war, especially all the old comrades-in-arms of the non-direct line Northwest Army and Northeast Army: Please think carefully about how contrary it is to conscience for a Chinese soldier to use foreign weapons to kill his own compatriots! How dishonorable it is to be a sacrifice for some reactionary groups that harm the country and the people! You must also recognize that today's general trend and the direction of the people's hearts are that the democratic cause will surely succeed; the dictatorial group will eventually fail. If you recognize these, you should immediately wake up, reject the reactionary orders, jump out of the civil war fire pit, and return to the people's side! If you do this, you will surely gain the sympathy and support of the broad masses of the people, and you will surely have great development and a bright future. You should not hesitate any longer, it is time to distinguish between right and wrong, and choose where to go!

　　Taking this opportunity, we would like to express our sincere gratitude to the military and civilians in the Liberated Areas and all democratic人士 who have shared our life and death, and helped us in times of need, and thank you for your concern and help to our army in the past year, and we sincerely hope that you will continue to give our army sincere guidance.

　　Finally, we shout:
　　Oppose the United States' assistance to Chiang in the civil war and demand the withdrawal of American troops from China!
　　Oppose dictatorial rule and realize democratic politics!
　　All patriotic people unite and fight to the end for the independence, democracy, peace and prosperity of the motherland!
　　Long live the Handan Uprising!
　　Long live the victory of the Chinese people!

　　Commander-in-Chief of the Democratic National Construction Army, Gao Shuxun
　　Deputy Commander Liao Anbang
　　Commander of the First Army Fan Longzhang
　　Commander of the Second Army Qiao Mingli led all officers and soldiers to kowtow together
　　October 30th

　　民主建国军邯郸起义一周年纪念宣言
    今天是中华民国卅五年十月三十日，是本军邯郸起义第一周年纪念日，亦即为本军自抗日战争结束后，退出内战第一周年纪念日。
    去年今日，本军在滏阳河畔，高举起反内战、争和平、反独裁、争民主的义旗，退出内战漩涡，回到人民方面来。这一个伟大的义举，不仅给国民党反动派以当头棒喝，给民主阵营以有力援助，给被迫从事内战的国民党官兵开辟了一条光明大路，并且在中国历史上也起了很重大的作用。因此，这一个伟大的日子，将永远为全国人民与本军官兵所庆祝与纪念。
    我们邯郸起义的目的是什么？简单的说，就是为了祖国的独立、民主、和平与富强。一年来，我们所看到和所经历的事实，已证明我们的目标与全国人民的要求完全一致，我们所选择的救国路线，完全是正确的，今后必须继续循着这条道路向前迈进。
    一年来，我们更加看透了中美反动派狰狞的面孔，狠毒的心肠，中国反动派背弃信义，说话不算，撕毁政协决议和停战命令，坚持独裁，进攻人民，以至不惜卖国求援，把我祖国的领土领空领海及内河航行等权，统统奉送给美国反动派，甘心给美国反动派作奴隶。在他们这一批军阀官僚集团的黑暗统治下，成千成万的人民被饿死，无数的民族工业被摧毁。而美国反动派，且明帮暗助，已成为我国内战扩大的根本原因。驻华美军一年来在京沪平津各地奸淫抢掠，走私杀人，凡此种种，已经和“七七”以前在平津的日军行为毫无二致。前门拒虎，后门进狼，言念及此，愤慨万分！当此纪念邯郸起义一周年之际，我们愿向全国人士郑重表示：为了祖国的独立民主和平与富强，我们坚决反对中国反动派出卖国家主权勾结帝国主义进攻人民的罪恶行为，坚决反对美国助长中国的内战，坚决反对美军的长期驻华，坚决反对美国企图变中国为美国殖民地的强盗阴谋。对于美国三十五大城市所举行的撤出中国运动周，以及上海重庆延安广州各地发动的要求美军撤出中国运动，我们谨寄以无上的同情与热烈的声援。
    一年来，我们更加认识了解放区是老百姓的。解放区已真正实行了耕者有其田，使人民有饭吃、有衣穿、无盗贼、无乞丐，解放区的人民一般都有政治认识与民族观念，可以说解放区的人民已经有了主人翁的资格了。解放区的文武官吏，一般都不怕死，不爱钱，不顾自身利益，只为人民服务，可以说解放区的官吏，已经够上人民公仆的称呼了。因此，我们不能不承认，解放区是人民的世界，是真正实行三民主义的地方。然而中美反动派却把这一块干净土视为眼中钉，必欲摧毁消灭之而后快，其丧心病狂之处，直是灭绝人性。当此纪念邯郸起义一周年之际，我们愿向全国人士郑重表示：为了维护公理与正义，我们坚决反对中美反动派进攻解放区，坚决反对中美反动派摧毁真正三民主义的人民政权。
    一年来，我们更加体验了人民力量的伟大，更加确信了民主力量的不可漠视。本军官兵亲眼看到解放区军队士气旺盛，民众踊跃参军；全国各地的民主人士，为了和平民主事业的前仆后继，反对中美反动派浪潮的不可遏止。而中国反动派，则既失民心，又失军心，危机四伏，败象已呈，如果不是美国反动派为之输血打气，眼看就要崩溃。得道者昌，失道者亡，得民者昌，失民者亡，这是古今中外不易的铁则，因此今天中国反动派，如再执迷不悟，继续执行其卖国独裁与继续内战的政策，其最后的结果，势必难脱玩火自焚的悲运。
    一切为民族民主奋斗的爱国志士们！让我们加紧团结起来！神圣的使命，催促着我们，胜利的信心，鼓舞着我们。我们必须不屈不挠，奋斗到底，深信我们的事业一定要成功；独立、和平、民主与富强的新中国一定要实现。
    趁这个机会，我们特向被迫从事内战的国民党军队官兵，尤其一切非嫡系的西北军、东北军的旧日袍泽致其忠告：请你们好好考虑一下，以一个中国军人，而拿着外国武器，残杀自己的同胞，是如何违背良心的事！为一些祸国殃民的反动集团作牺牲品，是如何不光荣的事！你们更要认清，今天大势所趋与人心所向，民主事业一定成功；独裁集团，终必失败，你们认清了这些，便应当立刻觉醒起来，拒绝反动派的乱命，跳出内战火坑，回到人民方面来！你们如果这样作，一定会得到广大人民的同情与拥护，一定会有远大的发展与光明的前途。你们不要再犹疑了，应该是明辨是非利害，抉择何去何从的时候了！
    趁此机会，我们谨向我生死与共，患难相依的解放区军民及一切民主人士，致诚挚的谢意，感谢你们一年来对本军的关怀与帮助，而且衷心希望你们继续不断的给本军以恳挚的指教。
  最后我们高呼：
    反对美国助蒋内战，要求美军撤出中国！
    反对独裁统治，实现民主政治！
    一切爱国志士团结起来，为祖国的独立民主和平富强奋斗到底！
    邯郸起义万岁！
    中国人民胜利万岁！
    民主建国军总司令  高树勋
    副司令廖安邦
    第一军军长范龙章
    第二军军长乔明礼率全体官兵同叩
    十月三十日
