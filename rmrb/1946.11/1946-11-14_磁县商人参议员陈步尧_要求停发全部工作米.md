    Ci County Merchant Senator Chen Buyao
    Requests Suspension of All Work Rice
    [This newspaper's Ci County dispatch] Mr. Chen Buyao, a merchant senator from this county, after reading in the People's Daily that Vice Speakers of the Bo Xing County Assembly called for the suspension of work fees for incumbent senators to support the front lines, quickly wrote to the county government saying: "I am a non-incumbent senator, but I now request that my work fee in millet be stopped, to slightly express my intention to support the front lines." Mr. Chen's spirit of supporting the front lines is worthy of everyone's learning. (Wang Hui)

    磁县商人参议员陈步尧
    要求停发全部工作米
    【本报磁县讯】本县商人参议员陈步尧先生，前阅人民日报载薄邢正副议长号召停发在职参议员工作费支援前线的消息后，很快的就写信给县政府说：“我是一个不在职的参议员，但我现在要求将我的工作费小米停止发，略表支援前线之微意”。陈先生此种支援前线的精神，值得大家学习。（王汇）
