　　Inspection Reveals Landlords Not Overthrown
    Lincheng Launches Thorough Liquidation
    Landlord Hao Laoxing of Gulu Camp Overthrown, Surrenders Four Guns
    In-Depth Movement After Major Inspection; Timely Resolution of Middle Peasants' Concerns
    [Report from this newspaper in Lincheng] The county's new district implemented a major inspection of the turn-over campaign, reigniting the mass movement. The county discovered from the October summary of the mass movement in the new district that since the beginning of the movement, only 24 percent (50,000 mu) of the land of the local bullies and landlords had been weakened, and the landlords had not collapsed economically or politically. The county then launched a major inspection of the turn-over. It was immediately discovered that the local bullies and landlords concealed land and property through false sales and "family separation"; they softened people by buying them off or offering a few items, or dealt with cadres as "smiling tigers"; in addition, they seized every opportunity to counterattack the peasants, spreading rumors to confuse the public, colluding with Chiang Kai-shek's special agents, and attempting to assassinate village cadres. In the past, cadres had shown a tendency to do everything for the movement, and afterwards they did not conduct in-depth investigations, so they thought the struggle was "almost" over. At the same time, some cadres regarded taking care of things as the main thing and liquidation as secondary, leaving most of the property to the landlords, and not allowing the masses to liquidate everything; or they had a one-sided understanding of the leniency policy, thinking that as long as the landlords confessed, it was over, as a result, the local bullies and special agents made false confessions and then carried out activities in secret to sabotage the mass movement. As a result, the local bullies and landlords did not bow their heads, the liquidation was not thorough, the bitterness was not poured out, and the fruits were not recovered to thoroughly turn the people over. After discovering these problems in various places, the cadres were immediately educated, and mass rallies were held to mobilize a thorough turn-over. In the second district, more than two hundred people from sixteen villages held a forum for a day, and everyone said: "I am a household that has been turned over, but I still can't get enough to eat and have no cotton clothes to wear. The old rich men sit still, but they still have white flour and pork to eat." Seventeen victims cried as they spoke. As a result, everyone unanimously exposed the landlords' cunning methods of "family separation" and "buying off," and demanded a thorough turn-over. After the meeting, the masses in each village immediately launched a general liquidation against the local bullies and landlords. In the past week, the peasants in each village have found one so-called "almost" feudal landlords, and have held the first liquidation meeting. Now, in the first and second districts alone, seventy-eight families have been found. According to this estimate, there are more than five hundred landlords in the whole county who have not been thoroughly struggled against. Hao Laoxing, a special agent landlord in Gulu Camp, has always been cunning, concealing land and property and paralyzing the masses. This time, when he was struggled against, he still pretended to be innocent, or said, "I have been struggled against until I am poor," which was very stubborn; but the masses had thoroughly investigated his property in advance by female members of the farmers' association, so after everyone pointed out his crimes, he had to bow his head to the masses. In the end, he took out four rifles and pistols, and admitted that he had led landlords such as Hao Guiren to flee to the Chiang-controlled area east of the road, colluding with Chiang's special agents, and attempting to assassinate village cadres. In addition, in the gradual development of the thorough liquidation movement in Gulu Camp, some middle peasants showed anxiety, saying, "Last time we liquidated the local bullies and landlords, this time it will probably be our turn." After discovering this phenomenon in the village, in order to stabilize the emotions of the middle peasants and unite all the peasants to deepen the movement, a forum was held for middle and poor peasants, and everyone explained: "Middle and poor peasants are one family, how can we struggle against ourselves?" Later, when discussing the seventeen liquidation targets, it was discovered that two of them were middle peasants, and the problem was solved on the spot by means of "untie the knot" negotiation. The middle peasants saw from the facts that the middle and poor peasants were indeed one family, and not only were their emotions stable, but they also actively participated in the struggle to thoroughly liquidate the local bullies Fan Yinlan, Fan Laocai, Hao Laoxing, and Hao Guiren.

　　检查发现恶霸地主没斗倒
    临城展开彻底清算
    古鲁营地主郝老醒被斗垮交出枪四支
    大检查后运动深入  及时解决中农顾虑
    【本报临城讯】本县新区实行翻身大检查，群运再起。该县从十月份新区群运总结中，发现运动开始以来，仅削弱恶霸地主土地百分之二十四（五万亩），地主在经济上政治上都没有垮台，该县便展开了翻身大检查。当即发现恶霸地主以假卖、“分家”等方式隐瞒土地财物；以收买、拿出少数物品实行软化，或以“笑面虎”姿态对付干部；另外，则抓紧每一个机会向农民反攻，造谣惑众，勾结蒋特，企图暗杀村干部。而干部过去在运动中表现有包办的现象，过后又不深入调查，便认为斗的“差不多”了；同时又有些干部把照顾当成主要的，清算当成次要的，给地主留下大部东西，群众要全部清算也不让；或是片面认识宽大政策，只要坦白就算了结，结果恶霸特务假坦白后，暗中活动，破坏群运。以致引起恶霸地主不低头，清算不彻底，苦水倒不尽，收不回果实翻不透身。各地发现这些问题后，立刻对干部加以教育，并召开群众大会动员彻底翻身。二区十六个村二百多群众座谈一天，大家都说：“我是翻了身的户，还是吃不饱，没棉衣穿。人家老财坐着不动，可是白面猪肉还是不离嘴。”会中有十七个苦主说着说着就大哭起来。结果大家一致揭破了地主的“分家”、“收买”等狡猾手段，要求彻底翻身。会后各村群众立即向恶霸地主进行总清算。一星期来，各村农民将过去认为“差不多”的封建地主一个个都找了出来，开过了第一次清算大会，现仅一、二区即找出了七十八家，据此估计，全县未斗彻底之地主当在五百家以上。古鲁营特务地主郝老醒一向奸滑，隐瞒土地财物，麻痹群众，此次被斗，仍假装无罪，或说：“已被斗穷”，十分顽强；但群众事先由农会女会员把他的财物调查得清清楚楚，所以大家指出他的罪恶后，不得不向群众低头，最后拿出了长短枪四支，承认曾领着郝贵仁等地主逃到路东蒋区，勾结蒋特，企图暗杀村干部。另外，在古鲁营彻底清算运动逐步开展中，一些中农表现了不安，他们说：“上次清算了恶霸地主，这次恐怕该轮到咱们头上了。”该村发现这一现象后，为了安定中农情绪，团结全体农民深入运动，便召开了一个中、贫农座谈会，大家说明：“中贫农是一家，自家还能斗自家？”后来在讨论十七户清算对象时，发现其中有两户是中农，当场以解“圪塔”的办法，协商解决了。中农从事实中看到中贫农确是一家，不但情绪安定，且积极参加了彻底清算恶霸范印兰、范老才、郝老醒、郝贵仁等的斗争。
