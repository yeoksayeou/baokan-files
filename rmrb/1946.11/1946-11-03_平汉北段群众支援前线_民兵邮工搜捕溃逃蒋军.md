Xinhua News Agency, Pinghan Front Line, 29th: Our correspondent at the front reports that the masses along the Pinghan Railway are fervently supporting the front lines. The powerful support team of over 16,000 people from Xushui participated in the glorious annihilation battle of Caohetou. They tied and bundled the collected 1,500-plus stretchers very comfortably with straw and bedding. Militiamen volunteered to form guerrilla teams, braving the bone-chilling cold river water all night to transport the wounded soldiers coming from the front lines. In addition, more than 500 carts fully loaded with supplies and ammunition followed the main force in an orderly manner. On the day after the victory of the annihilation battle, various villages raised eighteen fat pigs, one hundred and twenty catties of beef, over three thousand eggs, and a large quantity of vegetables and pastries, which were taken to the front lines by the comfort group to express their appreciation, giving all the commanders and fighters great encouragement.

Xinhua News Agency, Pinghan Front Line, 29th: Militiamen on both sides of the Pinghan Railway assisted the Eighth Route Army in searching for and capturing fleeing Chiang army officers and soldiers. More than 40 militiamen from Nanzhuang, Dingxing, recently used indigenous guns and spears near the village to force seventeen fleeing American-equipped Chiang soldiers to lay down their arms. The Chiang soldiers initially bullied them as "local militiamen" and attempted to fire and struggle, but were later shot down by the militiamen's sharpshooters before obediently surrendering. The militiamen immediately used the captured light machine gun, fifteen rifles, and one revolver to fully arm themselves. The Pinghan Railway Office of the Jizhong Postal Bureau, in cooperation with the local masses, surrounded and captured fleeing Chiang soldiers three times in a row on a certain day. The first time in the early morning, more than ten postal workers used deceptive tactics to surround and disarm more than forty Chiang soldiers; in the afternoon, when the masses reported that more than seventy Chiang soldiers were hiding in the cornfields, the postal workers and local militiamen cooperated to encircle them from all sides, capturing one part, while another part broke through and fled. That evening, when seven scattered Chiang soldiers broke in to seize grain, they were all captured by the postal workers.

    民兵邮工搜捕溃逃蒋军
    【新华社平汉前线二十九日电】本社战地记者报导平汉沿线群众狂热的支援前线。徐水一万六千余人的强大参战队参与了光辉的漕河头歼灭战，他们把集起来的一千五百余付担架都用秸草被褥缚捆得十分舒服。民兵们自动报名组成游击队，彻夜冒着冰冷透骨的河水来回转运火线上送下来的伤兵们。另外有五百余辆大车满载着给养弹药，有秩序的跟着主力兵团前进。歼灭战告捷的次日，各村募集了十八口肥猪，一百二十斤牛肉，三千余个鸡蛋及大批蔬菜、糕饼，由劳军团携赴战线慰问，给了全体指战员以极大的鼓舞。
    【新华社平汉前线二十九日电】平汉路两侧民兵协助八路军搜捕溃逃蒋军官兵。定兴南庄民兵四十余人，日前在乡村附近以土枪长矛迫使十七个窜逃的美械蒋军全部放下武器。蒋军最初欺侮他们是些“土民兵”，还企图开火挣扎，后来被民兵神枪手发枪撩倒了一个，才服服贴贴就擒。民兵即将缴获的一挺轻机枪、十五支步枪、和一支左轮手枪，全部武装了自己。冀中邮政局平汉路办事处邮工配合驻地群众，于某日接连三次围捕溃逃蒋军。清晨第一次，是十余名邮工以迷惑战术把四十多个蒋军包围缴械；下午群众报告棒子地里隐藏着七十多个蒋军时，邮工和当地民兵合作，从四面围抄上去，擒获一部，一部突围窜逃。当晚七个溃散蒋军又闯来抢粮时，悉数被邮工擒获。
