　　Guerrilla Warfare Vigorously Unfolded Along the Tongpu Railway Line
    Our Militia Team Attacked Zhaocheng
    Yuanqu Militia Twice Attacked Gaoluo Town
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 20th dispatch] The mass guerrilla warfare on both sides of the Tongpu Railway Line has completely compressed the invading Chiang troops within their strongholds. All the villages east of the Tongpu Railway Line in the Hongdong-Zhaocheng area, and half of the villages west of the line, are still under our control. Democratic decrees are unimpeded. On the night of the 15th of last month, our Zhaocheng First District militia rotation team took the opportunity to attack Zhaocheng city, firing guns and blowing horns, carrying out activities in all directions, and were warmly welcomed by the masses. After the Chiang troops rushed back to the city from the South Gate, our rotation team had already safely withdrawn from the East Gate. According to statistics, from October 8th to November 4th, within 28 days, the militia along the Tongpu Railway Line fought the Chiang-puppet troops 38 times, killing 12 officers and soldiers including the deputy head of the 181st Regiment of the 61st Brigade of the 90th Division of the Chiang army, wounding 36 people including Yan Tianzeng, a major member of the "comfort group," and capturing 7 people including an adjutant of the 90th Division headquarters.
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 20th dispatch] The heroic and skilled Yuanqu Second District militia twice attacked Gaoluo Town, an important stronghold of the Chiang-puppet troops, on the nights of the 13th and 16th of this month. On the 13th, after our side learned about the defense situation of the Chiang army in Gaoluo, they launched a surprise attack on Gaoluo Town that night with a ten-man assault force. First, they completely destroyed the four water mills behind the street and in the West Garden that supplied the Chiang army with white flour, and burned down a Chiang army bunker in Xiyao Gedada. Since then, although the Chiang-puppet troops have laid mines on all the main roads every night, and added a squad post on the West Gate tower, on the night of the 16th, our five elite militiamen once again attacked the town, distributing leaflets, and touched the gate of the "Revenge Team," wounding a Chiang secret agent sentry. Having suffered two attacks in a row, the Chiang-puppet troops in the town were extremely panicked. Ma Zhanquan, the Chiang-puppet village chief, and Shen Weifu, the village deputy, have now abandoned their posts and fled.

　　同蒲沿线游击战大力展开
    我民兵队攻入赵城
    垣曲民兵两度袭入皋落镇
    【本报太岳二十日电】同蒲线两侧群众游击战，把进犯蒋军完全压缩在据点之内，洪（洞）赵（城）一线同蒲路东全部村庄，路西二分之一的村庄，至今仍在我掌握中。民主政令畅行无阻。上月十五日夜，我赵城一区民兵轮战队更乘隙攻入赵城城内，打枪吹号，四出活动，受到群众热烈欢迎，待蒋军自南关赶回城内，我轮战队已安然自东门撤出。统计十月八日至本月四日，二十八天内，同蒲沿线民兵对蒋伪作战三十八次，击毙蒋军九十师六十一旅一八一团副团长以下官兵十二名，打伤“慰问组”少校委员阎天增以下三十六名，俘九十师师部副官以下七名。
    【本报太岳二十日电】英勇善战之垣曲二区民兵，本月十三、十六日夜，两度袭入蒋伪重要据点皋落镇。十三日，我方侦知皋落蒋军守备情况后，即于该日夜以十人之突击武装，袭入皋落镇。首将街背后及西园供给蒋军白面之四座水磨全部破坏，并烧毁西窑圪瘩蒋军碉堡一座。自此，该地蒋伪虽每晚在各要道设雷，并在西门楼上，加一个班哨，但十六日晚我精悍民兵五人，又再次袭入该镇，散发传单，并摸到“复仇队”大门口，击伤蒋特哨兵一名。连遭两次袭击，该镇蒋伪恐慌异常，蒋伪村长马占泉，村副申为福现已弃职潜逃。
