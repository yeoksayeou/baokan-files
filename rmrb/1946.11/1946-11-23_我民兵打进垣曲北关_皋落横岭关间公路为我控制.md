　　[Taiyue Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 21st] Our local armed forces and militia in Southern Shanxi and Northern Henan have launched continuous guerrilla offensives, completely pushing the invading Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops into isolated strongholds. The militia rotation team of the Second District of Yuanqu County, on the night of the 5th of this month, raided the northern gate of Yuanqu city and Beiyaoshang, burning down seven pillboxes. The defending enemy shrank into their bunkers,不敢应战daring not to fight back. The next day, more than a hundred Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops from Yuanqu, advanced towards Xixingma (15 li north of Yuanqu) in a retaliatory move, but were lured into a minefield by the militia of the Third District of Yuanqu, killing four and wounding six. The invading Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops then fled back to the city in panic, suffering ambushes from our guerrilla units along the way, making them utterly miserable. The Chiang Kai-shek puppet strongholds in Liuzhuangye, Guandi, and Shangxia Dingzhuang between Gaoluo town and Hengling Pass on the Jiang (County) Yuan (Qu) highway, were forced to retreat to Hengling Pass on the 13th and 14th. All fortifications and pillboxes were completely burned down by our militia. The entire 30-plus li highway between Gaoluo and Hengling Pass is under our control. On November 14th, a part of our local armed forces in Wenxi city raided Peicun, ten li northeast of Dongzhen, and the new recruits' battalion of the 38th Army Group of Chiang's army was defeated. A total of 15 Chiang's soldiers were killed or captured, and four rifles and some ammunition were seized. On the same day, more than a hundred puppet security troops entrenched in Jiyuan ventured out to harass the Xiliuyang area, but were defeated and fled back in a panic after being attacked by our local soldiers and civilians, with four enemies killed and sixteen captured alive.

　　我民兵打进垣曲北关
    皋落横岭关间公路为我控制
    【本报太岳二十一日电】我晋南豫北地方武装与民兵，连日展开游击攻势，把进犯蒋伪军完全压到孤立据点里去。垣曲二区民兵轮战队，本月五日夜更袭入垣曲城北关及北窑上，烧毁碉堡七座，守敌退缩在乌龟壳内，不敢应战。次日，垣曲蒋伪百余人，向我西行马（垣曲以北十五里）进犯，以示报复，又被我垣曲三区民兵诱入地雷阵内，炸死四人，炸伤六人，进犯蒋伪遂仓慌逃窜回城，沿途又遭我游击小组截击，狼狈不堪。绛（县）垣（曲）公路上皋落镇至横岭关之间刘庄冶、官底及上下丁庄等蒋伪据点，均被迫于十三、十四两日向横岭关撤退。所有工事碉堡被我民兵悉数烧毁。皋落至横岭关间三十余里公路，全部为我控制。十一月十四日，闻喜城内我地方武装一部，袭入东镇东北十里之裴村，蒋军三十八集团军总部之新兵大队被击溃。毙俘蒋军共十五名，缴获步枪四枝及子弹一部。同日困据济源之伪保安队一百余人，向我西留养一带出扰，经我当地军民打击，狼狈回窜，计毙敌四人，生俘十六名。
