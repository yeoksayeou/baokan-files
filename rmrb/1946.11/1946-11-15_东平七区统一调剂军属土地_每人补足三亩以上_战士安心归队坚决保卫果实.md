    Dongping Seventh District Unifies Land Allocation for Military Families
    Each Person Supplemented with More Than Three Mu
    Soldiers Return to Ranks with Peace of Mind, Resolving to Defend the Fruits [of Victory]
    [Our newspaper's dispatch from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region] The Dongping Seventh District is unifying the allocation of land for military families. At the district cadre meeting, it was decided that direct family members of military personnel would be supplemented with one mu of land per person, those who joined the regular army would have their allocation supplemented to five mu per person, those who joined the local army would have their allocation supplemented to four mu per person, staff members would have their allocation supplemented to three mu per person, and the families of martyrs would have their allocation supplemented to six mu per person, in order to completely fill in the gaps and make up for any deficiencies. When this method was conveyed to the villages, many poor villages with large numbers of military families were dissatisfied. They said, "We only divided this little bit of land, and it's not even enough for the families of martyrs. What are we supposed to divide?" Based on the reflections of the masses, the district immediately decided that each village would make unified adjustments, with villages that distributed more land supporting more military families, and villages that distributed less land supporting fewer. They divided the entire district into several sub-districts, and made adjustments on a sub-district basis. For example, fourteen villages around Dizi were divided into one sub-district. The entire sub-district recovered more than 21 *qing* of land from landlords. The district has a total of seventy military households, which averages to one military household for every thirty *mu* of land. Liu Lou has eight military households, and it requires sixty-five *mu* of land to supplement these eight military households, while this village only received 130 *mu* of land. In this way, according to the method of supporting one military household for every thirty *mu* of land, this village is responsible for supplementing the land for four military households, and the remaining four households are the responsibility of other villages. Dizi Village distributed a total of 300 *mu* of land, but there is only one military household in the village, so it should be jointly responsible with other villages for supplementing the land for nine military households. When this method was implemented, everyone said, "This method is good. If that village has more people joining the army, that village should distribute more land. If they hadn't joined the army to fight Chiang Kai-shek for us, we wouldn't even have gotten one *mu* of land!" With the land for military families completely resolved, the masses in each village have become more united. Three soldiers from Liu Lou who had not yet returned to the ranks were previously unwilling to return because they were afraid of not getting land. After hearing about this method, they voluntarily joined the new recruit regiment.

    东平七区统一调剂军属土地
    每人补足三亩以上
    战士安心归队坚决保卫果实
    【本报冀鲁豫讯】东平七区统一调剂军属土地。区干会议上决议直系军属每人补足一亩地，参加正规军的本人补足五亩，参加地方军的本人补足四亩，工作人员本人补足三亩，烈士本人补足六亩，以彻底填平补齐。这办法传达到村，许多军属多的穷村都不满意，他们说：“我们只分了这点地，还不够烈军属的呢，俺还分啥？”区里根据群众的反映，当即决定由各村统一调剂，分地多的村多拥军，分地少的村少拥。他们把全区分成几个小区，按小区为单位来调剂。如堤子周围十四个村划成了一个小区，全小区共从地主手中收回土地二十一顷多，该区共有军属七十户，即平均每三十亩地拥一户军属。刘楼有八户军属，补齐这八户军属须土地六十五亩，而这庄只分到一百三十亩地；这样，就按三十亩地拥一户的办法，由这庄负责补齐四户军属的土地，其余四户由别村负责。堤子村共分地三百亩，本村却只有一户军属，那么他就应同外村负责补足九户军属的土地。这个办法一实行，大家都说：“这法好，那庄参军的多，那庄就应该多分地，要不是人家参了军，给咱们打老蒋，咱不是连一亩地也分不到么？”军属的土地完全解决了，各村群众也更加团结起来。刘楼的三个没有归队的战士，以前怕分不到地不愿归队，听了这个办法，就自动参加了新兵团。
