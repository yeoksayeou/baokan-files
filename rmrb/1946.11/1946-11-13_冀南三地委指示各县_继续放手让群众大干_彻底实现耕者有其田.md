    Jinan Third District Committee Instructs All Counties
    Continue to Boldly Let the Masses Work Hard
    Thoroughly Realize "Land to the Tiller"
    [Special Dispatch from this newspaper] The Jinan Third District Committee recently inspected the mass movement in the district. Considering that there is still a long way to go to thoroughly realize "Land to the Tiller," on the 29th of last month, it issued an instruction to continue to thoroughly implement the mobilization of the masses to thoroughly realize "Land to the Tiller." It first stated: In the past month, mass movements in various places have achieved great results. In the new districts of Cheng'an, Yongnian, and Handan counties, and the first, third, and fifth districts of Linzhang, the feudal exploitation has been largely crushed. Land has been obtained by landless and land-poor impoverished peasants. In counties such as Daming, Wei, Guangping, and Feixiang, as well as the old districts of Jize and Quzhou, movements have also been greatly stirred up. Although the size and extent of the achievements vary, they are all in the process of realizing "Land to the Tiller." However, due to the relatively late start of truly letting go and greatly mobilizing the masses, and within the short period of just over a month, coupled with the large area, it is generally said to be very rough and not very thorough. The mass organizations are also not very solid. According to a report from Comrade Cheng'an: In the entire county, there are only seven or eight villages that have truly and thoroughly realized "Land to the Tiller" and established the superiority of the peasants. In most villages, the feudal exploitation in the economy has been eliminated, and the extremely poor peasants have been allocated land. However, the mass organization is poor, some are only formal organizations, the feudal rule of the landlords has not collapsed, and the superiority of the masses has not been established. There is also a kind of village where the struggle is fake, and no problems have been solved. Even the landlords control the village cadres to jointly deal with the masses. Although this kind of village is not the majority, it also accounts for a considerable part. Measuring the degree of mobilization of our masses and land reform by this standard, it is still far from the standard of thoroughly realizing "Land to the Tiller" and uniting and organizing more than 90% of the masses. Based on the above situation, the instruction clearly stated: Our district's future direction is to continue to thoroughly let the masses work hard and thoroughly realize "Land to the Tiller," uniting the majority, so that the masses not only achieve economic emancipation but also political and ideological liberation. To this end, each county must first conduct an in-depth, detailed, and specific inspection of the mobilization of the masses in its own region, and formulate a further implementation plan combined with the actual situation. As the situation varies from place to place, there should also be differences in work practices: First, in the border areas that have just started or have not moved at all, such as certain districts and villages in Linzhang, Wei, Yongnian, Chengci, Daming, and Handan, efforts should be concentrated to quickly mobilize the broad masses. Second, in the new districts that have been struggled through once, such as Yongnian, Chengci, Handan, and parts of Linzhang, Feixiang, and Guangping, a specific and thorough inspection should be conducted on a village-by-village and district-by-district basis. The inspection should be closely combined with ideological education and organizational consolidation. Third, the old districts such as Jize, Quzhou, and parts of Feixiang, Guangping, and Daming should be different from the new districts. Generally, it should be: (1) Those who have thoroughly realized "Land to the Tiller" will no longer struggle and will quickly carry out education and shift to production; (2) Although some landlords have collapsed economically, they have not collapsed politically and must be struggled with politically again; (3) Those landlords who still maintain their feudal exploitation and rule economically and politically must be resolutely liquidated; (4) If the landlords' exploitation has truly been eliminated, but the extremely poor peasants have not been eliminated, and the fruits are controlled by a few village cadres or have become their own, the method of drawing fat to supplement the lean should be implemented according to the instructions of the Central Bureau.

    冀南三地委指示各县
    继续放手让群众大干
    彻底实现耕者有其田
    【本报特讯】冀南三地委近检查该区群运，认为距离彻底实现耕者有其田尚远，于上月二十九日发出继续贯彻放手发动群众彻底实现耕者有其田的指示，首称：月来各地群众运动都获得很大成绩，新区成安、永年、邯郸三县及临漳一、三、五区，肥乡四区封建剥削已大部被打垮，无地和少地的赤贫和贫农，获得了土地；在大名、魏县、广平、肥乡等县及鸡泽、曲周老区也都大动起来，虽成绩大小程度各有不同，但都正在实现着耕者有其田。但由于真正放手大动的时间较晚，在短短的月余时间内，加之地区之大，一般说是很粗糙的，不是很彻底的，群众组织也不是很巩固的。据成安同志汇报谈：真正彻底实现了耕者有其田，树立起了农民的优势的村庄，全县也不过七八个村；大多数村是将经济上的封建剥削消灭了，赤贫农分得了土地，但群众组织性差，有的仅是形式的组织，地主的封建统治没垮，群众的优势没树立起来；还有一种是假斗争的村，啥问题也没解决，甚至地主掌握村干共同应付群众，此种村庄虽不是多数，但也占相当的一部分。以此来衡量我们群众的发动和土地改革的程度，距离彻底实现耕者有其田，团结组织百分之九十以上的群众标准尚远。根据以上情况，该指示明确的提出：我全区今后的方向是继续贯彻放手让群众大干下去，彻底实现耕者有其田，团结大多数，不仅使群众从经济上翻身，而且从政治上思想上得到解放。为此，各县首先要对自己本地区群众的发动，作深入细致的具体检查，订出结合实际的进一步贯彻发动的方针来。因各地情况不同，在工作作法上也应有区别：第一、在刚动或完全没动的边沿区，如临漳、魏县、永年、成磁、大名和邯郸的某些区村，应集中力量，迅速把广大群众发动起来。第二、在斗过一遍的新区如永年、成磁、邯郸以及临漳、肥乡、广平的部分地区应一个村一个区的作具体彻底的检查。在检查中要与思想教育整理组织密切结合起来。第三、在老区如鸡泽、曲周以及肥乡、广平、大名的一部分地区应与新区不同，一般应是：（１）已彻底实现了耕者有其田的不再斗，迅速进行教育转入生产；（２）地主有的经济上虽垮了，但政治上没垮，仍须从政治上再斗；（３）地主在经济上政治上仍保持其封建剥削与统治者，坚决清算；（４）地主剥削真消灭了，但赤贫农没消灭，果实掌握在少数村干部手里或已变为己有，应根据中央局指示实行抽肥补瘦办法。
