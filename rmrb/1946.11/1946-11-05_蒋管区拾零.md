　　Gleanings from the KMT-Controlled Areas
　　The panda that Chiang Kai-shek presented to the United States died suddenly on the 18th of last month. Zhang Peng, a section chief from the Sichuan Provincial Department of Education, who escorted it to Shanghai, and others were in attendance, personally witnessing its demise. The China Press even published an obituary on the same day.
　　The traitor Zhou Fohai, detained in the Nanjing Higher Court Detention Center, enjoys an exceptionally comfortable life. He orders all his meals from restaurants, and has someone to scrub his back when he bathes in the evening.
　　The arch-traitor Lin Baisheng was executed by firing squad in Nanjing last month. When he was placed in his coffin, he was actually covered with a national flag, and many people came to present wreaths. The Chiang government turns a blind eye to this, causing righteous people to express indignation.
　　After the Nanjing District Court interrogated the arch-traitor Ding Qiancun last month, Ding was allowed to move freely. Accompanied by his wife, he took a car to visit relatives and buy medicine, only returning to prison after three hours.
　　When the Qingdao City Council held a general meeting last month, Lin Qinchen, the director of the Land Administration Bureau, attended and gave a report. It was discovered that Wang Qiupu, an employee of the bureau who accompanied Lin, was a notorious traitor and was immediately expelled from the venue. More than a hundred prisoners have "escaped" from detention centers in Changsha, Hunan Province, and other places this year.
　　The National Identification Card system of the enemy and puppet era is now being restored in Tianjin and Beijing. Identification cards have been distributed to citizens, who are required to fill them out within one day.

　　蒋管区拾零
    蒋介石进贡美国的四川熊猫一头，上月十八日突死，沪滨陪送人川省教厅股长张鹏等均随侍在侧，亲视断命。当日华美晚报并登载讣告一篇。
    周逆佛海拘押于南京高等法院看守所中，生活异常优裕，每天饭菜皆叫自馆子，晚间洗浴，有人代为擦背。
    巨奸林柏生，上月在京枪决，入殓时，其身上竟盖有国旗一幅，往送花圈者亦大不乏人。蒋政府对此视若无睹，正义人士咸表愤懑。
    南京地院上月提审巨奸丁黔村毕，丁逆即自由行动，由其妻伴同乘坐汽车探亲购药，历三小时后始返监狱。
    青岛市参会上月举行大会时，由地政局长林钦辰出席报告，林带有该局职员王秋圃，经人发觉，原系著名汉奸，当被驱逐出场。湘省长沙等地地院看守所，今年共“逃脱”监犯百余人。
    平津两地现恢复敌伪时代之国民身份证制，身份证卡片已分发市民，限一日前填毕。
