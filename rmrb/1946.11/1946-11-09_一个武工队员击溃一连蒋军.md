　　Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 6th: Zaozhuang guerrilla fighter Liu Zhiye, on the night of the 12th of last month, coordinated with the main force to attack Liji in eastern Zaozhuang, ambushing Chiang Kai-shek's troops. After completing his mission, he returned to the team alone. While traveling on a mountain ridge about three miles from Buliji, he encountered a company of Chiang Kai-shek's troops withdrawing from the Niujiao stronghold to Zaozhuang. The Chiang Kai-shek's advance guard platoon falsely claimed to be the New Fourth Army and requested to be led the way. Liu Zhiye recognized them as the false Chiang Kai-shek's troops. He immediately pulled out his Mauser pistol, shot and killed the leading Chiang Kai-shek soldier, and threw two hand grenades at the huddled Chiang Kai-shek troops. The company of Chiang Kai-shek's troops then scattered in panic and disarray.
