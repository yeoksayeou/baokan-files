Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 5th: The Jiang troops here deeply fear attacks by our militia, leading to a situation where "the wind howls and cranes cry, every plant looks like a soldier." Jiang's troops stationed in Li Xiuhe and Xiaofentou in Xuanbu District, Taixing, agreed to gather at Xiaogengjia Village on the night of October 15th to loot the Laoyezhuang area in the eastern part of the city. However, when more than 80 Jiang soldiers from Li Xiuhe marched southwest of Xiaogengjia Village, they suddenly encountered Jiang's troops rushing from Xiaofentou. Mistaking them for a militia joint defense team, they engaged in battle in a panic. After a fierce battle lasting half an hour, they realized it was a misunderstanding. However, six people had already been shot and killed.

    泰兴蒋军怕民兵  吓得相互起火拚
    【新华社华中五日电】此间蒋军，深惧我民兵之袭击，致“风声鹤戾，草木皆兵”。泰兴宣堡区李秀河与小坟头两地蒋军，相约于十月十五日夜间至小耿家庄集合，往城东区老叶庄一带抢劫，但当李秀河八十余蒋军行至小耿家庄西南时，突然遭遇由小坟头赶来之蒋军，误为民兵联防队来袭，于慌乱中投入战斗，激战半小时，始发觉系误会，然已有六人中弹丧生。
