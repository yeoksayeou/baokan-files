    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th: Chicago dispatch: American political commentator Owen Lattimore strongly criticized U.S. policy toward China during a round table broadcast at the University of Chicago in late October. Lattimore stated that the United States must announce the failure of its China policy, and that U.S. interference in China's internal affairs has only made the situation worse. Lattimore criticized the so-called "mediation" of the Chinese disputes, saying: "It is completely not in accordance with right and wrong." Lattimore called for an immediate international conference to resolve the China issue.
    According to TASS, New York, 6th: Lattimore published an article in the New York Herald Tribune, urging the United States to stop interfering in China, and that the Kuomintang must stop shooting the people and begin political negotiations with them.
