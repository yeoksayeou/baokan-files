　　Jiji Local Corps Recovers Over a Hundred Villages
　　Five KMT Soldiers From Daoqing Desert With Weapons
　　[Our Newspaper Changzhi Special Dispatch] The Jiji Independent Regiment has recovered over a hundred villages, including Tagang Town. On October 26th, a part of the Kuomintang 85th Division, in coordination with the puppet security regiments of Jiji and Qi counties, invaded over a hundred villages including Tagang, Xiaodianhe, Shipoutou, and Zhengmian, raping, plundering, and causing the people of the entire county to fall into disaster. The Jiji Independent Regiment and the militia, in order to save the people, began on November 10th and fought bitterly for three days and three nights, driving the enemy back to their lair and completely recovering all the above-mentioned hundred villages. A total of twenty-two puppet squad leaders and lower ranks were captured, and twenty-two rifles were seized. The Tagang militia alone captured three enemies, seizing one machine gun and two rifles.

　　[Our Newspaper Changzhi Dispatch] The Fourth Military Subdistrict Committee recently announced the militia battle achievements in Bo'ai, Xiuwu (including county and district cadre teams), Qinyang counties, and Jiaozuo city in mid-to-late October. According to extremely incomplete statistics, a total of 173 stubborn enemies and traitors were killed, wounded, or captured, averaging nine people per day. Five rifles, seventeen head of livestock, and other materials were seized. They covered the transportation of 240 shi of grain for the masses. Bo'ai, Qinyang, and Jiaozuo city fought a total of 48 times in 20 days, averaging more than two times per day. Xiuwu killed, wounded, or captured a total of 102 people, while our side only suffered nine casualties, creating a battle record of one to ten. The Jiaozuo militia buried five landmines, all of which detonated, including one that destroyed an enemy vehicle.
　　[Our Newspaper Special Dispatch] Five KMT soldiers stationed in Jiaozuo City automatically deserted with their weapons and defected to the liberated area. After the enemy's 32nd Division originally stationed in Jiaozuo City was transferred east, the 51st Regiment of the 17th Brigade of the 38th Army took over and arrived in the Lifeng area. On the second night (the 8th), five KMT soldiers, led by Chang Weicheng (private first class), deserted with one machine gun, one grenade launcher, three Type 38 rifles, and more than 300 rounds of ammunition, automatically rebelling against the war and defecting to our army.
