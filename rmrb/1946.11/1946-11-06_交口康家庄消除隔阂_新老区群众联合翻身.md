　　【Benbao Yangcheng Second Dispatch】Jiaokou Town in Qin County was under the bloody rule of Japanese invaders and Yan Xishan for several years during the War of Resistance. Traitorous henchmen and local despots frequently engaged in burning, killing, and looting, causing immense suffering to the masses in the surrounding villages. Therefore, when our army cleared the entire territory of Qin County of enemy and puppet forces, the masses from villages near Jiaokou Town surged forward to launch grievance-airing and revenge movements against the traitorous henchmen and local despots in the town. The masses of Kangjia Village, a nearby old liberated area, also went to seek revenge against the giant traitor Zhao Cunde, the puppet district chief, and Ren Jinfang, the puppet cooperative manager, and others. However, although the masses in Jiaokou Town had also suffered under the enemy and puppet forces, they expressed dissatisfaction with the actions of the masses from the old liberated areas due to the long-term divisive policies of the enemy and puppet forces. Moreover, because they had been forced to loot grain in the old areas during the Japanese occupation, they also felt some apprehension. In order to eliminate the barriers between the masses in the new and old liberated areas, the district peasant association cadres launched and organized the people from both areas to air their grievances together, focusing their hatred on a few major despots. The masses from the new and old liberated areas united like brothers, organizing a grand united struggle meeting. The masses of Kangjia Village voluntarily proposed to temporarily preserve the fruits of the struggle until the masses of Jiaokou rose up before settling accounts, and they individually used family relationships to dispel the concerns of the Jiaokou masses. For example, farmer Wang Yonglu said to Zhao Shitou's wife in Jiaokou: "Your husband was killed by the enemy, you endured it for eight or nine years, having endured until today, won't you avenge your husband?!" When distributing the fruits of the struggle, the masses of Kangjia Village voluntarily gave valuable items such as land, houses, and livestock to the Jiaokou masses, taking some clothing and other items for themselves, creating a model of united struggle for the overthrow of oppressors by the masses of the new and old liberated areas.

　　交口康家庄消除隔阂
    新老区群众联合翻身
    【本报阳城二日电】沁县交口镇在抗战中曾为日寇、阎锡山血腥统治数年，汉奸恶霸经常四出烧杀抢劫，周围村庄群众痛苦不堪，因此当我军扫清沁县全境敌伪时，交口镇附近各村庄群众，便风起云涌向镇内汉奸恶霸展开诉苦复仇运动。交口邻近的老解放区康家庄群众亦去找巨奸伪区长赵存德、伪合作社经理任晋芳等复仇，而交口镇内群众虽曾身受敌伪摧残，但因曾受敌伪长期分离政策影响，对老解放区群众此种行动表示不满，又因日寇占据期间曾被驱使去老区抢过粮，又有些恐慌。区农会干部为消灭新老区群众间之隔阂，遂发动与组织新老区人民一起诉苦，把仇恨集中到几个巨大恶霸身上，新老区群众兄弟般团结起来，组织了大联合的斗争会。康家庄群众自动提出把斗争果实暂时保存起来，等交口群众起来后再算，并各自通过亲戚关系解除交口群众的顾虑。如农民王永禄找交口赵石头老婆说：“你男人被敌人杀死，你熬了八九年，熬到今天，还不替你男人报仇？！”分配果实时，康家庄群众自动将土地房屋牲口等值钱东西给交口群众，自己分得一些衣物等件，创造了新老区群众联合翻身斗争的范例。
