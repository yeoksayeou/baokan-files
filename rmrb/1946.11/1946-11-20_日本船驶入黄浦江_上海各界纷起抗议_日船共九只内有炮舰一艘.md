Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th: Shanghai report: After the incident of Japanese ships flying blood-red sun flags sailing into the Huangpu River and infringing upon Chinese sovereignty, various circles have protested. The Kuomintang authorities initially claimed ignorance and then defended the enemy, denying that the ships flew sun flags. However, due to the undeniable facts, they were forced to publish a message through the Central News Agency on the 13th, publicly admitting that the ships were Japanese "merchant ships" piloted by Japanese, permitted by MacArthur's headquarters to come to Shanghai from Japan, and approved for import by the "Naval Command." But according to a Shanghai dispatch from the Tianjin Yishi Daily on the 9th, a reporter visited relevant parties on the 4th and learned from the Fleet Command of the Naval Headquarters that on the afternoon of the 21st of last month, a Japanese gunboat No. 37 escorted six Japanese ships to Shanghai, with several blood-red sun flags triumphantly flying over the Huangpu River. The report also stated that the seven Japanese ships are still anchored near Gaochang Temple. The newspaper also stated that the report on the 4th that two Japanese ships at the Hongjiang Wharf escorted Chinese nationals to China and transported Japanese prisoners to Guangzhou was about the ships that arrived in Shanghai before these seven Japanese ships, and does not conflict with today's report.

    日本船驶入黄浦江
    上海各界纷起抗议
    日船共九只内有炮舰一艘
    【新华社延安十六日电】沪讯：高悬血红太阳旗的日本船只，驶入黄浦江，侵犯中国主权事件发生后，各界纷起抗议，而国民党当局初则诿称不知，继又为敌狡辩，否认悬有太阳旗。但终因事实俱在，无法掩饰，被迫于十三日由中央社发表消息，公开承认该船系由日人驾驶之日人“商船”，经麦克阿瑟总部许可由日来沪，并得“海军指挥部”准予进口云云。但另据九日天津益世报上海通讯称，记者四日走访有关方面，据海军总司令部舰队指挥部悉，上月二十一日午后六时，有第三十七号日本炮舰一艘护送六艘日船驶沪，数面血红太阳旗浩浩荡荡扬威于黄浦江上；现该七艘日舰仍停泊于高昌庙附近。该报并称，四日报载虹江码头两艘日轮护送中国侨民来华，载日俘转赴广州，系在此七艘日船以前来沪者，与今日所载并不冲突。
