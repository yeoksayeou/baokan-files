    Appreciating Our Army's Lenient Policy
    Meng County Officers Who Ceased Fighting Return Home
    [This Newspaper Reports] Zhou Fei, a lieutenant deputy company commander of the 9th company of the 3rd battalion of the Engineer Regiment and the 51st Regiment of the 17th Brigade of the 38th Division of the Chiang Army, and eight other officers, a total of nine, who laid down their weapons in the Meng County campaign in early August, have all been sent back to their hometowns by the Military Region Political Department on November 4th due to difficulties in taking care of their families. On the afternoon of the 3rd, the Political Department held a farewell banquet, and a tea party was held in the evening to say goodbye. During the meeting, the officers thanked our army for its preferential treatment. Second Lieutenant Platoon Leader Guan Tuliang said, "What I admire most is the Eighth Route Army's policy of treating prisoners of war with leniency. The Central Army would never do that; they would grab Eighth Route Army soldiers to replenish the ranks, and stab the cadres with bayonets. Your material conditions are so difficult, but as soon as we lay down our weapons, you take care of us in every way, which really makes me grateful." Second Lieutenant Platoon Leader Xu Yaorong of the same company said, "After coming to the Liberated Area, I realized that the responsibility for the civil war should be borne by the Kuomintang reactionaries." Warrant Officer Special Affairs Chief Yu Shouluk said, "I contracted a severe case of relapsing fever. Not only did your cadres often ask me how I was doing, but the doctors also took meticulous care of me. When I couldn't eat, they bought rice to cook porridge for me. I felt comfortable, didn't miss home, and recovered quickly. The Eighth Route Army can truly be said to be my benefactor." Deputy Company Commander Zhou Fei said, "I have written a farewell message. Please, by all means, help me send it to the newspaper office to be published." Everyone unanimously guaranteed that they would no longer fight a civil war for the warmongers and would not be victims of the civil war. Before departure, each person was given more than a thousand yuan for travel expenses. For those who were physically weak, livestock were found to transport them. On the morning of November 14th, each officer left the military region驻地 with a feeling of reluctance. (Chun)
    [Another Dispatch] Chen Baoguang, Liu Sijiu, Liu Wenyuan, and three others who maintained soldiers at Beiping Airport, were forced to land in the Liberated Area when their plane malfunctioned while they were flying to Yongnian in early June this year to drop clothing and grain to aid the pseudo-bandits Xu Tieying, etc. They all have families living in Beiping. In order to take care of their family difficulties, the Political Department of the Military Region also released them to return to their hometowns on November 4th at the same time. (Chun)

    感佩我军宽大政策
    孟县罢战军官返乡
    【本报讯】八月初旬孟县战役中放下武器之蒋军卅八师十七旅五十一团及工兵三团三营九连中尉副连长周飞等军官共九名，因照顾家眷困难，已由军区政治部十一月四日全部遣送回籍。三号下午政治部置酒欢送，晚间并设茶会话别。席间，军官感谢我军对他们的优待。少尉排长管土良说；“我最钦佩的是八路军的优待俘虏政策。中央军可不行，抓住八路军士兵补充队伍，干部用刺刀穿；你们物质条件这样困难，我们一放下武器，对我们反处处照顾，真使我感激。”同连少尉排长徐耀荣说：“我来解放区后，才知道内战责任要由国民党反动分子来负。”准尉特务长于守禄说：“我得了很重的回归热，不光你们干部经常问寒问暖，医生也细心治疗，不能吃饭给买大米熬稀饭喝，我心里舒服，不想家，病很快就好了，八路军真可说是我的恩人呢。”副连长周飞说：“我写了一篇临别寄语，无论如何，请帮我送到报馆给登出来。”大家一致的保证，回去不再给好战分子打内战，不作内战牺牲品。出发前每人发给路费千余元。身体弱的并找牲口送，十一月十四日清晨，每个军官抱着留恋的心情，离开军区驻地。（淳）
