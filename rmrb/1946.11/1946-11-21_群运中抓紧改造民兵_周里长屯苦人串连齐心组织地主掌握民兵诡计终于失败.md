　　Grasp Militia Transformation During Mass Movement
　　Poor People in Zhoulizhang Village Unite, Landlords' Conspiracy to Control Militia Ultimately Fails
　　[Our newspaper, Weixian, 16th dispatch] The militia in Zhoulizhang Village, Xiajin, was transformed during the mass movement. The village had organized a peasant association and militia in February and March this year, but the masses were not truly mobilized. Landlords seized this opportunity to place their own people in the peasant association, especially in the militia. They also bought off the militia captain with six mu of land. Among the nine militiamen, four were puppet soldiers and five were landlords. They did all kinds of evil in the village, swaggering around with guns, and no one dared to offend them. Later, Fan Zhishui and three others, who were the most oppressed, secretly colluded with many activists and organized a "wronged group" of more than 20 people. After a long period of brewing, they began to struggle against the local tyrant landlords in August. However, the militia captain, Zhang Zhongle, was ignorant of the greater good and refused to listen to advice. He gathered the nine militiamen, carrying big guns and fixing bayonets, and went straight to the meeting place, intending to stab Liu Ershui, the chairman of the trade union, to death. Fortunately, the district party committee's turnaround team was helping with the turnaround in the village. They immediately called on the masses to disarm the nine militiamen, tie them up, and detain them. The meeting continued, and the masses, relieved of ideological threats, immediately became active and overthrew the local tyrant. Then, a large number of new peasant association members were recruited, and capable members were selected from the peasant association and the trade union to form the militia, and Fan Zhishui was elected as the captain. Now, the militia has been developed to 19 members, the peasant association to 110 members, and the women's association to 150 members. They are very united and very consolidated. The masses in the village have all shared in the fruits of the struggle and improved their lives. They sing, "Chairman Mao leads us people to turn over and over," and they are extremely happy.

　　群运中抓紧改造民兵
    周里长屯苦人串连齐心组织地主掌握民兵诡计终于失败
    【本报威县十六日电】夏津周里长屯在群运中改造了民兵。该村今年二三月间曾组织过农会与民兵，但没有真正发动了群众。地主抓住这个空隙，便在农会特别是民兵中安置了自己的人。并以六亩地收买了民兵队长。九个民兵中，四个是伪军，五个是地主，在村中无恶不做，扛着枪走西逛东，没有一个人敢惹。后经最受压迫的范志水等四人秘密串连了许多积极分子，组织了二十多人的“冤枉组”，经过长时间酝酿，八月间开始向恶霸地主展开斗争。而民兵队长张忠乐竟不明大义，不听忠告，集合九个民兵，拿着大枪，上着刺刀，直奔会场，要把工会委员刘二水刺死。适值区党委翻身队在该村帮助翻身，随即号召群众把九个民兵的枪下了，把人捆绑扣押起来，继续开会，群众由于解除了思想上的威胁，立即大动起来，将恶霸斗倒。接着便大量吸收新农会会员，又在农会和工会里挑选了精干的会员组织了民兵，选举了范志水为队长。现在已经发展了民兵十九名，农会员一百一十名，妇救会员一百五十名。他们非常团结，也非常巩固。该村群众都分得了斗争果实，改善了生活。他们唱着“毛主席领导着咱百姓翻呀翻了身”，喜欢的不得了。
