　　Strive for the Victory of Comprehensive Resistance
    100,000 Youths Throughout the Region Enlist
    Elderly, Women, and Children Eagerly Volunteer for the Front Lines
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] In order to strive for the victory of comprehensive resistance, the people of our Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region saw 100,000 youths enthusiastically join the army in the first half of October alone, with over 20,000 from the Taihang Military Region alone. Currently, emancipated peasants from all over are still pouring onto the self-defense front lines, which is a powerful response to Chiang Kai-shek's insistence on engaging in traitorous civil war after a comprehensive breakdown. When the peasants, liberated from thousands of years of brutal feudal oppression, are working on their own land, and see or hear that Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous bandits are invading the liberated areas and their own hometowns, they loudly shout the slogans "Defend the land, defend our rice bowls" and "Drive back Chiang Kai-shek and live a good life," creating a surging wave of enthusiasm for joining the army. Even white-haired old men, women, and children are vying to sign up for the army. Wang Yumei, a woman from Wuxunhou Village, said, "It's not enough for me to join the army myself, I also have to mobilize my man to join the army." Her husband, Wang Xihai, was so anxious that he shouted, "Who needs you to mobilize me! I already signed up." Zhao Yougui, the 57-year-old village chief of Zhao Village, said, "I will risk my old life to fight Chiang the Baldy and protect our rice bowls. I'll go whether they call me or not." Many sixteen- or seventeen-year-old children cried and clamored at the new recruit registration office, insisting that they be allowed to join the army. Yu Kejian, a seventeen-year-old from Linqing, was furious when he heard that he had failed the requirements, saying, "Aren't you going to let me fight Old Chiang?" His mother also said sadly, "How can we repay the Communist Party and Chairman Mao's kindness?" Guan Cunzhang, a peasant from Qicun, Pingxiang, was about to get married, but when he heard that Chiang Kai-shek was determined to fight the civil war to the end, he rose up to join the army, saying, "I'll drive back Chiang Kai-shek and get married when I return." His fiancée also expressed her support. The people give the greatest concern and preferential treatment to the families of these brave warriors who are willing to sacrifice their blood for everyone and for themselves, and who have a high degree of awareness. In many places, the masses have automatically formulated military support and preferential treatment agreements, three-part forms, etc., and said from the bottom of their hearts: "The parents of the soldiers are our parents," and "If we don't do a good job in supporting the military, we are not raised by human parents!" Many places have already helped the families of soldiers and martyrs plant wheat and helped them mend their winter clothes.

　　争取全面抵抗胜利
    全区十万青年参军
    老头妇女儿童热烈争上前线
    【本报特讯】我晋冀鲁豫边区人民为争取全面抵抗胜利，十月份上半月内即有十万青年踊跃参军，仅太行军区即逾二万人。目前各地翻身农民仍源源涌上自卫前线，这是对于蒋介石全面破裂坚持卖国内战行为有力的回答。当农民从几千年残酷的封建压迫下解放出来，在自己土地上劳作的时候，看到或听到蒋介石卖国贼来进犯解放区、进犯自己的家乡的时候，他们响亮的喊出了：“保卫土地、保卫饭碗”，“打退蒋介石过好时光”的口号，造成了澎湃的参军热潮，连白发苍苍的老头，妇女和儿童，都争相报名参军，武训堠＠村妇女王玉美说：“我自己参军还不算，还要动员我男人参军。”她丈夫王锡海发急得直叫：“谁用你动员呀！我早就报上名了”。赵庄五十七岁老村长赵有贵说：“我要霍上老命和蒋二秃子拼一场，保住咱们的饭碗，叫去也得去，不叫去也得去。”很多十六七岁的小孩在新兵报名处又哭又嚷，纠缠着非让他们参军不可。临清十七岁的小孩于克俭听说他不及格，气极了说：“不叫俺打老蒋吗？”他母亲也凄切的说：“怎么报共产党毛主席恩呢？”平乡乞村农民关存章快结婚了，但当听到蒋介石决心打内战到底，便奋起参军说：“打退蒋介石回来再完婚”，他未婚妻也表示赞成。对于这些为大家为自己不惜牺牲流血的、具有高度觉悟人民的勇士们的家属，人民给予最大的关切与优待，许多地方群众自动订出优军优烈公约、三联单等，并出自心腑的说：“战士的爹娘就是俺的爹娘”，“不把优军工作做好不是人生父母养的”！许多地方现已帮助军烈属种上了麦子，还帮助补起冬衣。
