    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th: Washington dispatch: U.S. government senior officials have recently spoken with fear about the future economic crisis in the United States. Reconversion Director Steelman, in his eighth report to President Truman, stated: In the second year of peace, the U.S. national economy is facing a great hope and a great crisis; "A great hope lies in the opportunity we have to raise income standards, and a great crisis in the national economy lies in the fact that high levels of income and productivity may be difficult to sustain. If supply and demand become unbalanced, we will suffer such a crisis." Although senior government officials warned against "talking about the U.S. entering a depression," some senior government officials advocated issuing warnings in advance so that the current prosperity would not rise to an even higher level, thereby shortening the duration of the depression when it truly arrives. Most American economists seem to feel that the United States will have at least one setback before 1948.

    美经济危机必到来
    华府官员谈虎色变
    【新华社延安十五日电】华盛顿讯：美国政府高级官员最近纷纷以恐惧之情谈论美国未来之经济危机。复员局长斯蒂尔曼在向杜鲁门总统提出之第八次报告中称：美国在进入和平之第二年后，国民经济已面临一大希望及一大危机；“一大希望在于吾人已有提高收入水准之机会，国民经济之一大危机为在于高度之收入及生产力恐难维持。如一旦供求不能平衡，吾人则将遭受此种危机。”虽然政府高级官员警告勿“谈论美国之进入萧条”，但某些政府高级官员则主张事先提出警告以使目前繁荣不致走上更高水平，因而在萧条真正到来之时，缩短其时间。大部分美国经济学家似均感觉美国在一九四八年之前至少会有一个挫折。
