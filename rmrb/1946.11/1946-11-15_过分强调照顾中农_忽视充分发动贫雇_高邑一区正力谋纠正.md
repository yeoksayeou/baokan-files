    Over-emphasizing Care for Middle Peasants
    Neglecting Full Mobilization of Poor and Hired Peasants
    Gaoyi District One is Vigorously Seeking Correction
    [This newspaper's Gaoyi dispatch] In the "filling in the gaps and making things even" movement, District One of this county has corrected past errors, recognizing that in the peasant unity great turn-over, poor and hired peasants are the backbone of the turn-over struggle. In the first half of the movement, District One over-emphasized uniting with middle peasants and neglected mobilizing the poor and hired peasants who are the backbone force. At a conference of over three hundred activists on the 14th of last month, this issue was specifically discussed, and everyone unanimously agreed: "Poor and hired peasants are the locomotive of the turn-over. If mobilization is insufficient, the turn-over movement will not be thorough." Currently, all villages have paid attention to this issue, and the movement is gradually deepening. The backward poor peasants have also largely been drawn into the movement and will thoroughly turn themselves over this time.

    过分强调照顾中农
    忽视充分发动贫雇
    高邑一区正力谋纠正
    【本报高邑讯】本县一区在填平补齐运动中，改正了过去的错误，认清农民团结大翻身，贫雇农是翻身斗争中的骨干。一区在前半段运动中，过分强调了结团中农而忽视了发动作为骨干力量的贫雇农。上月十四日，三百余积极分子的大会上，专门讨论了这一问题，大家一致认为：“贫雇农是翻身的火车头，如发动不够，翻身运动就搞不彻底。”目前各村已注意这一问题，运动渐深入。落后的贫农也都大部卷入运动，要在这一次翻透身。
