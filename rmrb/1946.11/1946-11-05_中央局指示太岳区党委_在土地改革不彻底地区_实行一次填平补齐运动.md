　　The Central Bureau Instructs the Taiyue District Party Committee
    To Implement a "Leveling and Filling" Campaign in Areas Where Land Reform is Incomplete
    [Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] The Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Central Bureau recently sent a telegram to the Taiyue District Party Committee, instructing the district on how to thoroughly realize "land to the tiller." The instruction first pointed out that, based on the implementation of "land to the tiller" in Taiyue, land reform has been basically realized during the great development stage. However, loose ends remain. The liquidation is not yet thorough in many places, and much land is still retained in the hands of landlords; some farmers have not yet received land, or have received very little; some poor villages have not received land because of the disparity in land between rich and poor villages; some cadres and militia members have been allocated too much land, becoming detached from the masses; some organs and troops occupy a large portion of cultivated land, and the masses demand redistribution, etc. Based on this situation, in order to enable farmers with little or no land to obtain land, and to ensure that all farmers have land to cultivate, the Central Bureau has specifically decided to implement a "leveling and filling" campaign. The instruction continued: The land reform policy of our Party is to approve the farmers' basic demands for the realization of "land to the tiller" and for cultivated land to belong to the peasants. The method is to adopt methods such as liquidation, anti-traitors, anti-evil despots, rent reduction and rent refunds, so that farmers stand in a reasonable, advantageous, and legal position, fairly and reasonably obtain land, thoroughly eliminate feudal exploitation, and enable farmers to liquidate land and houses from the hands of landlords. After the land is cleared from the landlords, it can be roughly combined with a "leveling and filling" method based on whether there are disputes, so that all farmers with little or no land can obtain cultivated land, so as to fully realize the goal of "land to the tiller". The instruction finally pointed out: The "leveling and filling" campaign can achieve the elimination of feudal landlords and the rise of poor peasants, expanding the middle class. This "leveling and filling" method should only be implemented in areas where land reform is incomplete, and should not be adopted universally or mechanically. In order to strengthen the unity between cadres and the masses, cadres and militia members who have been allocated more land during the land reform movement can be persuaded to give up a portion to poor farmers through explanation and persuasion.

　　中央局指示太岳区党委
    在土地改革不彻底地区
    实行一次填平补齐运动
    【本报特讯】晋冀鲁豫中央局，日前致电太岳区党委，指示该区如何彻底实现耕者有其田的意见。指示首先指出：根据太岳耕者有其田实行的情况，在大发展阶段，土地改革，已基本实现。但仍留有尾巴。不少地方清算还不彻底，很多土地，仍保留在地主手中；有些农民，还未得到或者得到土地很少；有的则因贫富村土地悬殊，贫村农民还未得到土地；有的则因干部民兵分得土地过多，脱离群众；有的因机关部队占据大部耕地，群众要求重新分配等等。根据此种情况，中央局为使少地或无地的农民都得到土地，使全体农民有田可耕，故特决定实行一次填平补齐运动。指示继称：我党土地改革的方针，是批准农民实现耕者有其田，耕地归农的基本要求。做法是采取清算反奸反恶霸减租退租等方法，使农民站在有理有利的合法地位，公平合理去取得土地，彻底消灭封建剥削，使农民从地主手中把土地房屋等清算出来。从地主手中将土地等清出后，即可大体根据有无纠葛，再适当配合填平补齐办法，就能使所有少地或无地农民获得耕地，达到完全实现耕者有其田的目的。最后指示指出：填平补齐运动，可以做到消灭封建地主和使贫农上升，中间扩大。这种填平补齐办法，只宜在土地改革不彻底的地区实行，而不应普遍的机械的采用。为了加强干部与群众的团结，在土地改革运动中，多分得土地的干部和民兵，可以经过解释说服让出一部分来，分给贫苦的农民。
