　　Jiang Special Agent Activities in Kangzhuang
    Exposed, Captured by Us
    [This newspaper reported] As the Self-Defense War intensifies, Jiang special agents who illegally seized village political power in Kangzhuang, Xingtai, took the opportunity to engage in activities. On the evening of the 20th of last month, five production personnel from our ×× unit, including Meng Xuxiao, went to Kangzhuang (eight li from the city) for business. As soon as they entered the village, they were surrounded by more than ten militiamen, who fired more than a dozen shots at them. Meng and others presented their passes, but negotiations were ineffective. They tried to break through three times but failed. They were forcibly tied up and beaten for an hour under the pretext of being bandits. It was only when the district cadre living in the village learned of this and investigated that it was discovered that the village militiamen were threatened and used by the village chief (a Jiang special agent) to attempt to harm our personnel. The Jiang special agent was then captured and sent to the county government.

　　康庄蒋特活动
    事泄为我捕获
    【本报讯】自卫战争紧张进行之际，邢台康庄窃据村政权之蒋特趁机活动，上月二十日晚，我××部生产人员孟须小等五人因事赴康庄（离城八里），刚一进村即被民兵十余人包围，并向他们打了十几枪。孟等拿出通行证交涉无效，向外突围三次均未冲出，硬被彼等以土匪为名，捆绑吊打一小时后，始为住该村之区干部知悉，追讯结果，始知该村民兵受村长（蒋特）威胁利用，图暗害我工作人员，当将该蒋特捕获解送县府。
