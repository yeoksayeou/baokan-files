Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 31st. Yesterday was the anniversary of General Gao Shuxun's邯郸 Uprising. The CCP Northwest Bureau hosted a banquet in the afternoon for all members of the Democratic National Revolutionary Army visiting delegation. In the evening, a gala was held in the Lin Can Hui Auditorium, with the People's Theater Troupe performing "Everyone is Happy" and "Su Wu Herding Sheep" to mark the celebration.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 31st. On the anniversary of the邯郸 Uprising, General Fan Longzhang, former commander of the New Sixth Division under General Gao Shuxun (now commander of the First Army of the Democratic National Revolutionary Army), told our reporter: "The邯郸 Uprising represents the demands of the vast majority of the people. This not only strengthened the confidence of the people throughout the country in opposing the civil war, but also gave me personally the opportunity to gain some understanding of the Liberated Areas." Speaking of his impressions of entering the Liberated Areas for a year, he said: "No matter how lacking a person is in understanding of the Liberated Areas ideologically, as long as he sees the facts, he will eventually be changed by the facts. I have heard about the revolution for more than 30 years, and now I realize that what Mr. Mao is leading is the real revolution. Now that Mr. Chiang is still going to carry out the civil war, he is bound to fail, because the ancients said, 'An army without a just cause is bound to fail.'" General Fan finally called on the national Chiang army to take action to oppose the civil war, in order to achieve national independence and national democratic peace as soon as possible.

　　中共西北局庆贺邯郸起义周年

    范龙章将军谈一年观感
    【新华社延安三十一日电】昨日为高树勋将军邯郸起义周年纪念日，中共西北局特于下午欢宴民主建国军参观团全体团员，晚间在临参会礼堂举行晚会，由民众剧团演出《大家欢喜》《苏武牧羊》以志庆贺。
    【新华社延安三十一日电】邯郸起义周年日，原高树勋将军所部新六师师长范龙章将军（现任民主建国军第一军军长）向本社记者发表谈话称：“邯郸起义代表了最大人民的要求，这不但增强了全国人民对于反对内战的信心，就我个人来说，也开始有机会对解放区作一番了解。”谈及进入解放区一年来之观感时说：“不管一个人在思想上对于解放区如何缺乏认识，但只要他一旦看见事实，终会被事实所改变。我听到革命已经三十多年了，现在认识毛先生所领导的才是真革命。现在蒋先生仍然要进行内战，他必然要失败，因为古人说过‘师出无名必败。’”范将军最后号召全国蒋军行动起来反对内战，以求民族独立和全国民主和平早日实现。
