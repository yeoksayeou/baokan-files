Wu Yi Simplified Normal School Affiliated Experimental Elementary School practices thrift, studies diligently, and supports the war effort. First, it reduced the number of cooks by three, with students and teachers taking turns cooking. They put forward the slogan "You can't graduate if you don't learn to cook!" They also reduced the number of clerks by one, with the head of general affairs, Comrade Xu Zhaiyi, voluntarily taking on the clerical work as well, saying, "The soldiers are fighting on the front lines, risking their lives against the reactionaries. What does it matter if we do more logistical work in the rear!" The whole school also launched a campaign to donate money and materials, raising 30,730 yuan in one day. Sun Hongshun, a fifth-grade student from an extremely poor family who usually wears patched clothes, even donated a new towel from his home to the front lines.
