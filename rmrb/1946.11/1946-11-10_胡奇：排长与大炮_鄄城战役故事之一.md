　　The Chiang Kai-shek troops, under the cover of aircraft, fled from Buzhuang, attempting to invade Juye. Soon after, on the open ground, we were engaged in fierce combat with the invading forces. Twenty-odd invading soldiers were driving a large horse, pulling an American-made cannon, attempting to take advantage of the situation to slip away along a road. This was spotted by Chen Yongmei, the platoon leader of the 1st Platoon of the 30261st Company. With a shout, the entire platoon chased after them. The enemy pulled the cannon around the Dayang Lake, and the platoon chased to the Dayang Lake. The enemy pulled the cannon around the Xiaomiao Temple, and the platoon chased to the Xiaomiao Temple. However, the enemy was far ahead, and the platoon's soldiers couldn't catch up.

　　"Letting this cannon lightly return to the reactionaries would be a great loss!" Platoon Leader Chen Yongmei was a little anxious, so he unbuttoned his collar and ran even faster than before. The soldiers were energized and followed him in a sprint.

　　The enemy, pulling the cannon, was approaching another village. The platoon's soldiers pounced like tigers. Suddenly, a volley of bullets came from the village with a "soso" sound. Platoon Leader Chen didn't pay any attention and continued to advance. Then, another burst of machine-gun fire sent dust flying in front of them. Platoon Leader Chen ordered the soldiers to immediately lie down on the spot. Watching as the enemy was about to pull the cannon into the village, Platoon Leader Chen was at a loss. But then, he suddenly pulled the machine gunner Chen Guizhou and shouted loudly, "Hey! Why aren't you firing at that big horse!" Chen Guizhou aimed his machine gun and swept across the big horse. The soldiers' rifles also fired directly at the panicked enemy. Amidst the crisp and chaotic sounds, the surrounding enemies fell, and the big horse twitched twice with its hooves in the air and collapsed. The remaining enemies, terrified, abandoned the cannon and turned their heads, scrambling and crawling into the village.

　　As Platoon Leader Chen led the soldiers excitedly to the cannon, the fire from the village intensified again. Platoon Leader Chen didn't say anything, just waved his hand. The soldiers pulled the gun carriage, wanting to retreat, but the road was blocked by dead bodies, preventing the heavy cannon from moving forward. As Platoon Leader Chen and the soldiers were struggling to turn the gun wheels, the planes came again, strafing them. Platoon Leader Chen immediately ordered the soldiers to dig fortifications, determined to defend the cannon. After the soldiers took cover in the fortifications, the planes circled away. However, the fire pressure from the village became increasingly fierce. At this time, a dozen enemies bypassed the barricades and were about to rush out of the village to seize the cannon. Before the enemy could gain a foothold, Platoon Leader Chen took the lead and charged to the tombs in front, using the terrain of the tombs to form the first line of defense for the cannon. Soldiers Luo Qun and Zhang Baogui moved to the fortifications on the other side of the cannon, forming the second line of defense for the cannon.

　　After a while, a dozen enemies charged to the outside of the barricades again. Platoon Leader Chen waved his hand again, and the soldiers simultaneously pulled the triggers. Five or six enemies fell in response, and the rest had to scurry back to the village along the way they came. The cannon was safely escorted to the rear of our army. The number of this cannon is "7097NECO1944."

　　胡奇：排长与大炮
    鄄城战役故事之一
    飞机掩护进犯鄄城不庄的蒋军逃窜了，一会儿，在平垛子上，我们就跟进犯军混战成一片，二十几个进犯军赶了一匹大马，拉着一门美造大炮，想趁势顺着一条路溜走，即被三○二六一连一排长陈勇梅同志看见了，他一声吆喝，全排战士就尾追上去，敌人拉着大炮绕过大杨湖那边，一排就追到大杨湖那边，敌人拉着大炮拐过小庙那边，一排就追到小庙那边，但是敌人却远远的在前头，一排战士赶不上去。
    “让这门炮轻轻的又回到反动派那里去，那是一个多大的损失！”排长陈勇梅有些着急了，就把钮扣解开，跑得比先时更快，战士们都有了劲，也跟着飞奔上去。
    敌人拉着大炮快到另一个村子附近，一排战士猛虎似的扑过去，突然从村子里索索的射来一排子弹，陈排长连理也没理，照旧向前进，接着又是一梭机枪，打得前面尘土飞扬，陈排长指挥战士们立即就地卧倒，眼看着敌人就要把那门大炮拉进村子去了，陈排长没了主意，可是他忽然把机枪射手陈贵周一拉，大声喝道：“唉！怎么不扫射那匹大马呢！”陈贵周机枪对准大马横扫过去，战士们的步枪也齐向着慌乱的敌人直射过去，在清脆浑浊的声响中，四周敌人倒了，大马也四蹄朝天抖了两抖倒下去了，吓得其余的敌人丢下大炮，扭转头跌跌爬爬的窜进村子里去。
    陈排长领着战士兴奋的冲到大炮跟前时，村子里的火力又压过来。陈排长没说话，只把手一挥，战士拉着炮架要往回走，可是面前死人挡着路，使那沉重的大炮不能前进，陈排长正跟战士奋力转动炮轮时，飞机又来了，朝着他们扫射，陈排长立即命令战士挖工事，决心守卫这门大炮。战士们隐蔽到工事里以后，飞机才旋走，可是从村子里压过来的火力越来越凶猛，这时十几个敌人绕过鹿砦要冲出村子夺炮，陈排长没等敌人站稳脚，就领头冲到前头坟地那边去，待他们把鹿砦跟前的敌人打倒后，陈排长就依着坟的形势构成保卫大炮的第一线，战士罗群、张宝贵转到大炮那边的工事里，构成保卫大炮的第二线。
    隔了一会，十几个敌人又冲到鹿砦外边来了，陈排长再一挥手，战士们齐扳机枪，五六个敌人就应声倒下，其余只好沿着来路窜回村里去。这门大炮安然无恙的护送到我军的后方，这门大炮的号数是“七○九七ＮＥＣＯ１９４４。”
