　　Overturning Themselves Together with the Men:
    Xuanzhong Village Mobilizes Women to Participate in the Rent Reduction Campaign
    [Report from our Changzhi correspondent] In the recent rent reduction campaign in Xuanzhong Village, She County, special attention was paid to mobilizing women to participate, greatly strengthening the peasant forces. At the beginning of the rent reduction in the village, the leadership emphasized men and neglected women, believing that women were useless and lacked the patience to mobilize them. They only talked about it in general terms, so that the vast majority of oppressed women remained outside the movement. On the 14th of this month, a meeting of women cadres was held, with male cadres also participating. The woman cadre Shi Lingli said: "I used to be the first wife of the landlord Liu Anren, getting up early and working hard for him for several years, without a good day. In the 24th year of the Republic of China, he married a concubine and drove me out. I couldn't make a living, so I went to Zhang Jincheng's house in Suobao to work, cooking for four whole years. In the 28th year, the Eighth Route Army came and I was liberated, but I haven't settled accounts with Liu Anren yet. There are still many women in our village who have been oppressed by landlords and have never turned over. This time, we must have a thorough reckoning with the landlords and bullies." Her speech gave everyone great inspiration. They all said: "We women must turn over with the men." The male cadres also said that the peasant forces would be even greater with the addition of women. It was decided to go separately to connect with and enlighten oppressed women. After two days of effort, 44 women were involved in the movement, and the momentum of connecting and enlightening is continuing. The women's emotions have been heightened, and they all say: "This time, we must overthrow the feudal bullies and have a thorough turn over."

　　和男人们一齐翻身
    悬钟村发动妇女参加查减
    【本报长治讯】涉县悬钟村在最近查减运动中，特别注意发动妇女参加，大大增强了农民力量。该村开始查减时，领导上重视男人忽视妇女，认为妇女不中用，没有耐心去发动，只是一般的谈了谈，以致广大受压迫的妇女仍置身于运动之外，本月十四日妇女干部开会，男干部也参加，妇女干部石伶俐说：我过去给地主刘安仁当大老婆，起早搭黑给他动弹了好几年，没好活过一天，民国廿四年他娶上小老婆，把我赶出来，我没法生活，我到索堡张金成家作活，整整做了四年饭，廿八年八路军来了我才解放了，可是我还没有向刘安仁算账，咱村里还有不少受过地主压迫的妇女从没有翻过身，咱们这回也要和地主恶霸们来个彻底清算。”她的发言给了大家很大的启发，一致说：我们妇女要和男人一齐翻身，男干部也说，加上妇女，农民力量就越大了，当决定分头去串通启发受压迫的妇女，经两天努力，即有四十四名妇女卷入运动，现还在继续酝酿串通，妇女们情绪提高，都说：“这回要把封建恶霸斗倒，来个彻底翻身。
