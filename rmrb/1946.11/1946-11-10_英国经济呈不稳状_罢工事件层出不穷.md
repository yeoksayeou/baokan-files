    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 5th: According to a London dispatch published in the American magazine *World Report* on September 17, British workers are staging strikes "on their own" without regard for union leaders. It also stated that "unofficial" strikes, that is, the act of walking off the job without regard to the opinions of union officials, has become a major problem for the current British Labour government. Although British strikes are not as serious as those in the United States, and major industries have not been shut down due to union-called strikes, the trend of lower-level workers stopping work on their own is gradually increasing, striking suddenly while union leaders are still negotiating. In the first half of 1946, there were 1173 strikes in Britain, all of which were small in scale, but only one was approved by the union. For example, the London gas workers went on strike demanding a four-cent increase per hour. Although the union leaders supported it, the strike lasted for a week, causing gas to be cut off on 1,400 miles of London streets, plunging the city into the darkness of wartime "blackout." Milk workers went on strike to demand higher wages, causing London's milk supply to be cut off suddenly. The dispatch continued: "Many strikes are caused by the basic economic instability in Britain, with the wages of most workers unable to keep pace with prices." The dispatch concluded: "The endless increase in unofficial strikes leads Londoners to speculate that labor leaders, who have close ties with the Labour government, are gradually losing close contact with the lower-level masses."

　　英国经济呈不稳状
    罢工事件层出不穷
    【新华社延安五日电】据美国《世界报导》周刊九月十七日刊载伦敦通讯称：英国工人不理工会领袖而“自行”罢工的事件层出不穷。又称：“非正式”罢工，即不管工会职员的意见，而放下工作离工的行为，已形成英国工党政府当前一大问题。英国罢工虽不如美国之严重，亦未因工会号召罢工而使主要工业停顿，但下层工人自行停工的趋势逐渐增加，当工会领袖仍在谈判之时，突然罢工。一九四六年上半年，英国发生罢工一一七三次，规模虽均不大，但曾经工会同意罢工者仅一次。例如伦敦煤气工人罢工，要求工资每时增四分，虽然工会领袖支持，罢工达一星期之久，使伦敦一千四百英里街道煤气断绝，陷于战时“灯火管制”时的昏黑状态。牛奶工人为要求增资罢工曾使伦敦牛奶来源顿时断绝。该通讯继称：“许多罢工均起因于英国基本的经济不稳，大部工人工资不能与物价并驾齐进。”该通讯结语称：一非正式罢工有增无已，使伦敦人士推测与工党政府有密切关系之劳工领袖正逐渐失掉与下层群众的密切关系。”
