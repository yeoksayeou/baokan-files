　　To Cooperate with the Comprehensive Resistance and Strengthen Current Affairs Education
    Taiyue Bookstore Releases a Large Number of New Books
    Organizations and Schools in Shahe and Other Places Donate Money in Response to the Call to Support the Army with Books and Newspapers
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, October 24th] In order to cooperate with the comprehensive resistance and consolidate the ideological front, the Taiyue Xinhua Bookstore has formulated a large publishing plan to oppose Chiang Kai-shek's internal war and national betrayal, expose the policies of American imperialism, and praise the struggles of the people in the Liberated Areas. It has been successively completed under the tense work of all employees, printing and editing staff. The publications that have already been released include "Crushing Chiang Kai-shek's Offensive," "Comprehensive Resistance," "Various Aspects of the Kuomintang-Controlled Areas," "Extinguishing Chiang Kai-shek's Secret Agent Violence," "The Tricks Played by the United States Against China," "Anti-Civil War, Anti-National Betrayal Reader," "The Tongpu Front," "Seven Warriors," "Hot Tears and Others," "Selection of Struggle Songs of the People of Pinglu," etc., a total of 26 types, totaling 55,000 copies, including treatises, novels, dramas, folk songs, and communications. In particular, the two popular reading materials, "Anti-Civil War, Anti-National Betrayal Reader" and "The Tricks Played by the United States Against China," are most popular among the masses, and have now sold 6,000 copies.
    [This newspaper] The "Supporting the Army with Books and Newspapers" campaign initiated by New Masses is now being carried out enthusiastically in villages, schools, and organizations throughout the area. Comrade Wang Kuan, a correspondent for the journal, reprinted many copies of the appeal letter for supporting the army with books and newspapers and distributed them to villages and schools in the first and second districts of Shahe. The masses, children, and self-defense forces in five villages in the second district of Shahe, including Yiliao Gou, Quanhu, and Gaozhuang, have donated more than 9,000 yuan. Comrade Liu Zhitian, a correspondent for the journal, went from house to house, promoting current affairs and organizing donations, raising more than 2,000 yuan in one night. The journal has now sent the first batch of 1,000 new books to the front lines. The Propaganda Department of the Military Region Political Department and New Masses have not only sent letters of commendation for this work, but also suggested that the journal inscribe the words "Presented to the heroes who defend the Liberated Areas" or concentrate the donations to the heroes of a certain battle when giving books and newspapers to the front-line soldiers.
    [Another Dispatch] Cadres in the sixth district of Licheng responded to the call of the Xinhua Bookstore and the New Masses bi-monthly for supporting the army with books and newspapers, and specially donated 1,300 yuan to purchase books for the soldiers at the self-defense front. (Ma Lin)
