    Licheng and Pingshun Both Achieve "Cultivate Three, Surplus One"
    Total Fine Grain Production Increased by 340,000 Shi
    Main Experiences: Intensive Farming Improves Technology
    Close Integration of Agriculture and Sideline Occupations
    Promote the Planting of Special Crops
    [This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch, 7th] The Licheng County government recently announced its annual production summary for the year, stating that due to the implementation of the correct policy of intensive cultivation combined with agricultural and sideline occupations, the county's more than 80,000 farmers achieved a total agricultural income of more than 640,000 shi this year, an increase of 142,364 shi and 8 dou compared to last year. The total cultivated land area in the county is 358,625 mu, with an average increase of 4 dou per mu. The entire county has reached "Cultivate Three, Surplus One." Throughout the year's production campaign, more than 2,000 labor heroes, model production activists, and model cadres emerged. The development of production organizations has also exceeded any previous year. 85% of the county's population has participated in mutual aid organizations, with a total of 388 mutual aid brigades, 27 labor mutual aid societies, and 3,117 mutual aid groups. In terms of sideline occupations: there are 115 village cooperatives in the county, 254 small agricultural and sideline occupation cooperatives, and 638 regular transportation groups. Textile production has achieved self-sufficiency. This year's income from sideline occupations, based on statistics from only the second and sixth districts (out of six districts in the county), is 38,641,300 yuan, which can be converted to 145,573 shi of grain. Based on the current standard of living, with an average of 6 shi and 5 dou and 4 sheng of grain per person per year for living expenses, reproduction costs, and burdens, it has indeed exceeded "Cultivate Three, Surplus One." Due to the sharp increase in income, the people's living standards have also improved significantly. For example, in 30 villages in the second district, 5 villages have achieved "Cultivate One, Surplus One," 12 villages have achieved "Cultivate Two, Surplus One," and 12 villages have achieved "Cultivate Three, Surplus One." Only Songjiazhuang village has enough to eat and wear. There is no longer a single impoverished household in the entire district. After the autumn harvest, another 280 poor peasant households have risen to middle peasant status, and 130 middle peasant households have risen to rich peasant status. The summary pointed out the reasons for achieving "Cultivate Three, Surplus One" this year: (1) The ideological education of "Cultivate Three, Surplus One" to become wealthy was thoroughly implemented. Taking the old hero Shi Cunjin of Hojia Yao's labor and prosperity as an example, in-depth publicity was carried out throughout the county, and specific production difficulties were solved for each poor peasant, such as the holding of poor peasant forums in Hojia Yao, so that the policy of "Cultivate Three, Surplus One" was implemented from the leadership down to every peasant. (2) All villages universally established technical research associations to study and improve technology, ensuring intensive farming for agricultural production. When sowing, warm water soaking of seeds was universally carried out. During the summer weeding, the slogan "Bury the roots of millet, expose the roots of sorghum, small hoe weeding is most suitable" was proposed to carry out inspection and improvement of weeding techniques. Shi Cunjin also researched and promoted cotton transplanting techniques to remedy uneven cotton seedlings. The whole village transplanted seedlings on 28 mu. Cotton, sorghum, corn and other crops throughout the county were all hoed and trimmed more often. (3) Make every effort to promote special crops and improved varieties. This year, the county planted approximately 40,000 mu of cotton, with an increase of 1 shi and 5 dou of grain per mu compared to grain. More than 25,700 mu of Golden Queen corn were planted, with an increase of 7 dou per mu compared to local corn. (4) The combination of agricultural and sideline occupations was implemented throughout the year. After precise calculations, the villages drew surplus labor at any time to engage in sideline production. For example, the small agricultural and sideline occupation cooperative in Beiliu Village earned more than 2,466,000 yuan in one year, which could buy more than 400 shi of rice. The transportation team led by Shi Cunjin of Hojia Yao, with 11 laborers and 15 animal power, has earned 500,000 yuan since spring. The whole village increased by 11 livestock and 30 mu of land. The sideline occupation income of Shi Fuquan's family in the village this year, in addition to their daily expenses, also bought a livestock and five mu of land. Guo Chunmei, a textile hero in Cheyuan Village, and her daughter-in-law, sold 92 zhang of cloth throughout the year in addition to their family of four's clothing needs, which exceeded three times the family's agricultural income.

    [This newspaper's news] Pingshun County's agricultural and sideline occupations this year have increased the equivalent of 200,000 shi of fine grain. This year, the county harvested a total of 751,283 shi and 5 dou and 8 sheng of grain (including grain converted from sideline occupations). Compared with 548,659 shi and 6 dou and 2 sheng last year, the increase was 202,623 shi, 9 dou and 5 sheng (of which the agricultural increase was 70,000 shi, and the rest was the increase in sideline occupations), exceeding any previous year. Calculated on the average per capita in the county, it reached "Cultivate Three, Surplus One."
    The reasons for the county's enormous achievements are, first, the close integration of agriculture and sideline occupations: thousands of small cooperatives and large cooperatives have been organized throughout the county. Moreover, under the leadership of the cooperatives, textile, transportation, livestock industries and the collection of mountain goods (such as medicinal materials) have been greatly developed. This income totaled 353,679 shi of grain (calculated at 1,000 yuan per shi). Secondly, intensive farming in agriculture: taking Xigou in the second district as an example, plowing and hoeing were generally done three times, and 30 to 100 dan of fertilizer were applied per mu. In addition, the improvement of technology, selection of seeds for soaking, reduced the loss of insect pests. Thirdly, the promotion of special crops; Yue Zengtian in the third district planted 3 mu and 5 fen of cotton this year, picking 112 jin of clean cotton (large scale), and each jin of cotton can be exchanged for 1 da dou of millet locally. Planting cotton for one year is more cost-effective than planting millet for three years. Guo Yucheng of Dongdan Village in the fifth district planted half a mu of Golden Queen and harvested 2 shi and 8 dou. Labor hero Li Shunda planted 10 mu of Golden Queen, which increased production by 15 shi compared to ordinary corn. Finally, the mutual aid groups were rectified and strengthened. According to statistics from eight villages in the first district, last year there were 92 mutual aid groups, and 20 of them did not work; this year there are 95 mutual aid groups, and only eight of them do not work.

    黎城平顺均达耕三余一
    共增产细粮三十四万石
    主要经验：精耕细作提高技术
    农业副业密切结合
    推广种植特种作物
    【本报长治七日电】黎城县府顷宣布今年该县全年生产总结称：由于贯彻了深耕细作与农副业结合的正确方针，全县八万余农民，今年农业总收入达六十四万余石，比去年增产粮食十四万二千三百六十四石八斗，全县耕地总面积为三十五万八千六百二十五亩，每亩平均增产四斗。全县均已达到耕三余一。全年生产运动中涌现劳动英雄与生产模范积极分子、模范干部二千余人。生产组织发展亦超过以往任何一年。全县百分之八十五的人口均已参加了互助组织，共三百八十八个互助大队，二十七个劳动互助社，三千一百一十七个互助小组。副业方面：全县有村合作社一百十五个，农副业结合的小型合作社二百五十四个，经常的运输组六百三十八组，纺织已作到自给自足。今年副业收入仅二、六两个区（全县六个区）的统计为三千八百六十四万一千三百元，可折谷十四万五千五百七十三石。根据目前生活水平，以每人每年生活及再生产费用、负担等项平均六石五斗四升粮食计，实已超过耕三余一。由于收入的激增，人民的生活水准亦显著提高，如二区三十村中已有五个村作到耕一余一，十二个村耕二余一，十二个村耕三余一，仅宋家庄一村够吃够穿。全区已没有一户赤贫，秋收后又有二百八十户贫农上升为中农，一百三十户中农上升为富农。该总结指出今年达到耕三余一的原因：（一）贯彻了耕三余一发家致富的思想教育。以霍家窑老英雄石寸金劳动发家为例，在全县进行了深入宣传，并具体为每一贫农解决生产困难，如霍家窑开贫农座谈会等，使耕三余一的方针从领导一直贯彻到每一农民。（二）各村普遍成立了技术研究会、研究提高技术，保证了农业生产的深耕细作，下种时普遍进行了温汤浸种，夏季拔苗中提出：“埋根黍子露根谷，小锄拔苗最合适”的口号，进行锄苗技术的检查与提高。石寸金并研究与推广了棉花移植术以补救棉苗不齐。全村移苗二十八亩。全县棉花、谷、玉茭等作物，都作到了多锄多修理。（三）全力推广特种作物与优良品种。全县今年种棉花约四万亩，每亩较粮食增产粮一石五斗、种金皇后玉茭二万五千七百余亩，每亩比土玉茭增产七斗。（四）农副业结合贯彻了全年。各村经过精确计算，随时均抽出剩余劳力搞副业生产。如北流村农副业小型合作社，一年赚洋二百四十六万六千余元，可买米四百余石。霍家窑石寸金领导的运输队十一个劳力，十五个畜力，春天到现在赚洋五十万元。全村增加牲口十一头，增加土地三十亩。该村石福全一户今年副业收入除自己日常支出外，还买牲口一头，地五亩。车元村纺织英雄郭春梅和她媳妇，全年纺织除她家四个人穿衣外，还卖布九十二丈，超过全家农业收入的三倍。（黎城办公室）
    【本报讯】平顺全县今年农副业折合共增产细粮二十万石。全县今年共收粮食（包括副业折合粮）七十五万一千二百八十三石五斗八升。与去年五十四万八千六百五十九石六斗二升比较，增产二十万零二千六百二十三石九斗五升（其中农业增产数为七万石，其他为副业增产数），超过以往任何一年。按全县人口平均计算，达到耕三余一。
    该县获得如此巨大成绩的原因，首先是农副业密切结合：全县组织了成千的小型合作社与大合作社。且在合作社领导下，大量发展了纺织、运输、牲畜各业及采集山货（如药材）等。是项收入共计折合粮食三十五万三千六百七十九石（按每石千元折合计算）。其次是农业上精耕细作：以二区西沟为例，普遍作到犁、锄三遍，每亩地上肥三十至一百担。加上技术的提高，选种浸种，减免了虫害损失。再次，推广特种作物；三区岳增田今年种了三亩五分棉花，摘净花一百十二斤（大秤），每斤花当地能换小米一大斗。种一年花比种三年谷子还合算。五区东弹村郭玉成种半亩金皇后，打了二石八斗。一等劳动英雄李顺达种金皇后十亩，比种普通玉茭增产十五石。最后，整顿和加强了互助组，根据一区八个村统计，去年有互助组九十二个，就有二十个不起作用；今年互助组九十五个，不起作用的只有八个。  （王巨林）
