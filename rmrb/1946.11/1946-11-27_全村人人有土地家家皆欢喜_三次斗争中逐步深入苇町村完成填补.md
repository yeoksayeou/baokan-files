　　The Whole Village Has Land, Everyone is Happy:
    Deepening and Completing Land Reform in Weicun Village Through Three Struggles

    [Our newspaper Yangcheng, 23rd dispatch] After leveling and compensating land, Weicun Village in Jincheng has thoroughly realized "land to the tiller." The distribution of fruits of struggle in the village has been improved three times. After the first struggle, the masses still had the idea that things could change and feared big traitors and local bullies. Only a few activists and cadres took the lead. Most of the fruits of the struggle were turned over to the public or used by the militia, and only a small portion was distributed equally among households. Even the big local bully, the "Four Heavenly Kings," received their share. The land and livestock were sold at a price, but the poor peasants and military families were unable to buy them, and they were all bought by the wealthier middle peasants and above. At that time, the masses coldly watched the cadres and said, "We are still freezing without cotton clothes, and we are still eating chaff." The second time, the peasants' association was reorganized, and a renewed call to action ignited the masses' flames of revenge. One after another, the so-called "Four Heavenly Kings" and "Eight Vajra Guardians" were overthrown, and 830 mu of land, 40 head of livestock, and more than 450 shi of grain were recovered. The distribution of fruits this time was completely different from the first time. The masses proposed that since the struggle was everyone's struggle, the distribution of fruits should also be for everyone, and it was divided into three levels: the first level was poor and hardship-suffering military families, the second level was poor peasants, and the third level was activists. However, as a result of the distribution, because there were too many activists, they took up most of the fruits, which aroused dissatisfaction among the middle peasants, and there were still gaps in the unity of the peasants. In the third in-depth movement of investigation and reduction, the landlords returned another 120 mu of land, nine head of livestock, and 50 shi of grain. When distributing the fruits, there was a fierce debate between the cadres and the masses. Finally, the principle of leveling and compensating was determined. The assessment committee visited door-to-door to solicit everyone's opinions, made a list of what was needed, and distributed it fairly through democratic discussions at the conference. As a result, those with less land were compensated with land, those who lacked food were given grain, and the honorably discharged veterans and small groups received not only enough land and grain to live on but also a set of essential household items to settle down. After the three major movements in the village, the class relations were completely changed. Before the movement, there were eight landlord households with 64 people, occupying 524 mu of land, averaging 8.3 mu per person. There were 15 rich peasant households with 76 people, occupying 543.8 mu of land, averaging 7.1 mu per person. There were 123 middle peasant households with 501 people, occupying 2,150 mu of land, averaging 4.2 mu per person. There were 103 poor peasant households with 366 people, occupying 705.5 mu of land, averaging less than 2 mu per person. There were 18 extremely poor households with 66 people, occupying 17.8 mu of land, averaging less than 0.3 mu of land per person. Now it has been transformed into seven new rich peasant households with 28 people, averaging 8 mu of land per person. There are 250 middle peasant households with 943 people, averaging 4 mu per person. The landlords still maintain sufficient living, averaging 3 mu of land per person. The middle peasants have been strengthened, and the landlords and poor peasants have been eliminated, thoroughly realizing "land to the tiller."

　　全村人人有土地家家皆欢喜
    三次斗争中逐步深入苇町村完成填补
    【本报阳城二十三日电】晋城苇町村经过填平补齐，已彻底实现耕者有其田。该村分配斗争果实曾经三次改进，第一次斗争后分配果实时，群众还有变天思想，恐惧大汉奸恶霸，仅有部分积极分子与干部打先锋，斗争出来的果实大部归公或民兵使用，少部份按户平均分配，甚至连大恶霸“四大天王”也分得了果实，而土地与牲口则作价出卖，贫农与军属无力购买，全被中农以上的富有者买去，当时群众冷眼看着干部说：“没有棉衣还是冻着，该吃糠还是吃糠”。第二次整理了农会组织，重打锣鼓才又激起群众的复仇火焰，接二连三的斗倒了所谓“四大天王”“八大金钢”，收回土地八百三十亩，牲畜四十头，粮食四百五十余石。此次分配果实与第一次完全不同，群众提出斗争是大家斗争，分配果实亦应大家分，并划为三个等级：第一等为贫苦抗属，第二等为贫苦农民，第三等为积极分子。但分配的结果，因积极分子太多，占去果实的大部，引起中农的不满，使农民团结中依然裂有隙缝。第三次运动深入查减，地主又退出土地一百二十亩，牲口九头，粮食五十石。分配果实时，干部与群众间曾经一次剧烈的争论，最后确定了填平补齐的原则，评委会挨门挨户的访问，征求大家的意见，把需要的东西开出单子，经大会民主讨论，公平分配，于是少地的补地，缺吃的给粮，荣退军人小群除得到足供生活的土地与粮食外，并分得一套安家的必需用具。该村经过三次大运动，阶级关系完全变更，运动前原有地主八户，六十四人，占有土地五百二十四亩。每人平均八亩三分。富农十五户，七十六人，占有土地五百四十三亩八分，平均每人七亩一分，中农一百二十三户，五百零一人，占有土地二千一百五十亩，每人平均四亩二分。贫农一百零三户，三百六十六人，占有土地七百零五亩五分，平均每人不足二亩。赤贫十八户，六十六人，占有土地十七亩八分，每人平均不足三分地。现变为新富农七户，二十八人，每人平均土地八亩。中农二百五十户，九百四十三人，每人平均四亩。地主仍保持足够生活，每人平均土地三亩。壮大了中农，消灭了地主与贫农，彻底实现了耕者有其田。
