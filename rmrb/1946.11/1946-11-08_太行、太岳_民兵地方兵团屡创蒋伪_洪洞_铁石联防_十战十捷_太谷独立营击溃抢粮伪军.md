Taihang, Taiyue
    Militia Local Corps Repeatedly Defeat Chiang Kai-shek and Puppet Troops
    Hongdong "Iron and Stone Joint Defense" Achieves Ten Victories in Ten Battles Taigu Independent Battalion Defeats Puppet Troops Looting Grain
    [Our Yangcheng dispatch, 6th] The Taihang militia and local corps have recently achieved new victories on the Tongpu railway line and in the rear of Chiang Kai-shek's and Yan Xishan's puppet troops in southern Shanxi. On the 31st of last month, over a hundred members of Yan Xishan's "Struggle Corps" from Pingyao attacked, but were defeated, and one machine gun was captured. On the 1st, over five hundred men from the 219th Regiment of Yan Xishan's 73rd Division attacked eastward from the eastern suburbs of Pingyao, and most of their 9th Company was annihilated, with over sixty killed or wounded, over ten captured, and four machine guns and over twenty rifles seized. On the 21st of last month, a platoon of Chiang Kai-shek's troops from Quwo marched north from Mengcheng, but were surrounded just over a li from the village, and all but four who escaped were annihilated, with one machine gun and fourteen long and short guns captured. The Hongdong militia organized "Iron and Stone Joint Defense" to defend their homes, and despite being outnumbered, repelled over ten attacks by Chiang Kai-shek's troops in the twenty days from October 5th to 25th. For example, on the 16th, a battalion of Chiang Kai-shek's troops attacked Xia Lu Village, but was repelled by a platoon of militia led by Liu Tingyao, who killed or wounded five members of the "Revenge Team" including the captain. On October 8th, the militia of the Second District of Yuanqu used fire to attack two bunkers controlling the Yi (county) - Yuan (qu) highway, and the Chiang Kai-shek troops inside fled in disarray, and the two bunkers were reduced to ashes. In total, the above victories resulted in over a hundred Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan puppet troops being killed or wounded, including company commanders and below, over thirty captured, six machine guns and over forty long and short guns seized, and over one hundred and twenty jin of wire recovered.
    [Special dispatch from our newspaper] Chiang Kai-shek's and Yan Xishan's puppet troops looting grain in the northern border area of Taihang have been fiercely attacked by our local armed forces in recent days, achieving successive victories. On the morning of the 4th, the 23rd Regiment of Yan Xishan's puppet security forces stationed in Rencun, Taigu, attempted to loot grain in Fancun. When they reached Dongjia Village (both south of Taigu), they were ambushed by the Taigu Independent Battalion. After half an hour of fierce fighting, the Yan Xishan puppet troops abandoned seven corpses and fled in panic. In this battle, over twenty Yan Xishan puppet troops were killed or wounded, nineteen were captured, and two light machine guns, two small cannons, over twenty rifles, and thousands of rounds of ammunition were seized. We suffered no casualties.
    [Another dispatch] Over four hundred members of the Yuanshi puppet security regiment advanced towards the north and south Su Yang areas west of Yuanshi on the 30th of last month, but were intercepted by a detachment of local guerrilla heroes on the way, abandoning three corpses and fleeing back. Over twenty stubborn puppet troops were killed or wounded, one was captured alive, and some military supplies were seized. On the same day, four of our army scouts intercepted eleven Yan Xishan puppet troops attacking from Jingxing, killing five of them. A small detachment of our Jingxing Independent Battalion attacked Beixiulin Village near Jingxing on the evening of the same day, burning down a large wooden bridge, which has prevented the Jingxing section of the Zhengtai Railway from reopening to traffic.
