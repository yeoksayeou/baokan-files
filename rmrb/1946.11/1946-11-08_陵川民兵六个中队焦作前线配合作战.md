　　Six Militia Battalions from Lingchuan
    Cooperate in Combat on the Jiaozuo Front
    [This newspaper Jiaozuo news] Director Gou of the Lingchuan County Military Committee led six militia battalions south to support the Jiaozuo front militia on the fourth day (the 15th of last month) after the enemy invaded Jiaozuo, jointly carrying out guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines. On the 17th, more than 300 Chiang's troops, carrying a cannon and six machine guns, attacked the Twelve Lingshan Village area. Upon hearing the news, Director Gou immediately led a militia battalion to intercept them. After fierce fighting until 3:00 p.m., the enemy could not withstand and fled in a panic. The militia intercepted two bundles of white cloth that had been looted and immediately returned them to the masses.

　　陵川民兵六个中队
    焦作前线配合作战
    【本报焦作讯】陵川县武委会苟主任于敌人侵入焦作后之第四日（上月十五日）带领陵川民兵六个中队南下，支援焦作前线民兵，共同开展敌后游击战争。十七日，蒋军三百余人携炮一门、机枪六挺，向十二令村一带进攻，苟主任闻讯，立即率民兵一个中队前往截击。激战至下午三时，敌人不支，仓慌回窜，民兵截获被抢去之白布两捆，立即交还群众。
