　　Remember This Bloody Hatred!
　　Chiang Planes Indiscriminately Bomb Daming
　　[Our newspaper, Jinan, 7th dispatch] Eleven Chiang planes carried out a brutal bombing of Daming City at 1:30 PM on the 4th, lasting for an hour and a half. Over 360 civilian houses were bombed, and over 220 Catholic Church buildings were bombed (including the entire "Siwei" Middle School run by the church). As of the time of this telegram, the total losses cannot yet be calculated. Seventeen corpses were found in just one courtyard. Our Jinan Third Administrative Office has urgently mobilized to go to the disaster-stricken areas to comfort the families of the victims and provide relief to the refugees in the wake of Chiang's bloody crimes.
　　[Our newspaper, Weixian, 7th dispatch] Under the cover of a "peace" smokescreen, Chiang planes have continuously attacked residents in various parts of Jinan. On the 17th of last month, when the masses in Tiantaishan, Feixiang, were settling old scores with local bullies and landlords, a US-made Chiang plane suddenly came and frantically strafed the assembly, seriously injuring three people and killing five. On the 20th, the mule and horse fair in Shengcun, Guangping, was again subjected to a large-scale strafing by Chiang planes, killing three people and wounding five. On the 22nd, the large market in Guangping City was attacked by Chiang planes again, killing thirteen people and one donkey. At 10:30 AM on the 23rd, one Chiang plane swooped down over Linzhang, circled in a show of force, and then flew away. The people in various places are extremely resentful of such attacks by Chiang planes, and all residents in the liberated areas are filled with indignation.
