Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 4th: Beiping News: Following the layoff of over 10,000 employees at the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Bureau at the end of August, the Bureau now intends to lay off over 4,000 more, purportedly to "transfer them to the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Bureau." This group of employees previously went to the Kuomintang Beiping Executive Headquarters to petition, and received permission from Li Zongren, the Director of the Executive Headquarters, to submit a request to the Executive Yuan to cease further layoffs. However, the Railway Bureau suddenly announced the layoff of 1,600 employees in the middle of last month, and ordered that the remaining 2,000+ employees would continue to be laid off. Upon hearing the news, the employees were filled with grief and indignation, and on the 19th of last month, selected representatives to come to Beiping again to petition Li Zongren.

　　平津铁路职工  请愿不要裁员
    【新华社延安四日电】北平讯：平津铁路局，继八月底裁撤员工一万余名后，近又以“调拨津浦路局”为名，拟裁撤四千余人，此一部分员工前曾来往国民党北平行辕请愿，并得平行辕主任李宗仁允准，呈请行政院不再裁员。但路局突于上月中旬发表裁撤员工一千六百名，并命令其余二千余名，将继续裁撤。员工闻讯，悲愤交加，于上月十九日，选派代表再度来平向李宗仁请愿。
