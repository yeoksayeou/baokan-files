　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 4th -- According to an Associated Press dispatch from Rome: Judging from the results of the recent election of local officials in Italy, the Italian people are increasingly leaning to the left. Of the two hundred and seventy-four electoral districts, the results are in for two hundred and sixty-eight, of which one hundred and twenty-four are dominated by left-wing and neutral parties, while independents only hold a majority in thirty-three districts. The Socialist Party and the Communist Party together won one thousand seven hundred and six seats in one hundred and eighty-two districts, creating a good record in Italian elections. Some political figures say that the strength of the left-wing forces may affect the policies of the Gasperi government. In order to obstruct the development of democratic forces, the reactionaries have organized armed bandits in northern Italy to engage in terrorist activities. According to the "Republican Voice" newspaper, the three departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force and their general staff have become havens for remnants of Fascism.

　　意国地方选举进步党派获胜
    【新华社延安四日电】据美联社罗马讯：从意大利最近一次选举地方长官投票结果来看，意国人民已日益左倾。二百七十四个选区中，已有二百六十八区揭晓，其中一百廿四区由左派及中立派占优势，独立派则仅在卅三区占多数。社会党与共产党在一百八十二区中共获一千七百零六席，造成意国选举中的良好纪录。一部分政界人士称：左派势力的强大，可能影响加斯贝利政府之政策。反动派为阻挠民主力量的发展，已在北意组织武装匪徒，从事恐怖活动。据共和呼声报称：陆海空军三部及其参谋部已成为法西斯残余的掩护所。
