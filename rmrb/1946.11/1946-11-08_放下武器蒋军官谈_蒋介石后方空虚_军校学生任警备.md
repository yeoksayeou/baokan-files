　　Surrendered KMT Officer Talks
    Chiang Kai-shek's Rear is Empty
    Military Academy Students Assigned to Garrison Duty
    [Our Frontline Reporter Team, 3rd dispatch] Gao Yue, an upper-ranking secretary of the 356th Regiment who surrendered at Liujiazhuang, told reporters that Chiang Kai-shek's forces are scattered and his rear is empty. He presented a letter from within the KMT, sent from the Seventh Branch School of the Central Military Academy in Xi'an, stating that since the Seventh Branch School moved to Xi'an, due to the emptiness of the city's defenses, four squadrons of students, including the 7th, 8th, 11th and 13th, have been assigned to garrison duty. Another four squadrons are building fortifications and bunkers in the south of the city to defend against "Communist attacks" from the Luonan area. Each of these squadrons is equipped with two rocket launchers, two anti-tank guns, two mortars, and two heavy machine guns, which is the best equipment of the KMT army. Therefore, "public security can be guaranteed."

　　放下武器蒋军官谈
    蒋介石后方空虚
    军校学生任警备
    【本报前线记者团三日电】据刘家庄放下武器的三五六团上尉书记官高跃对记者称：蒋介石兵力分散，后方空虚，并以其内部从西安中央军校第七分校寄来之信件出示，该信谓：七分校自移驻西安后，因城防空虚，已将七、八、十一、十三等四个中队的学生，担任警备。另有四个中队，在城南构筑工事堡垒，以防雒南一带之“共军来袭”。彼等每队配备有火箭炮两门、战防炮两门、迫击炮两门、重机枪两挺，为蒋军最优良之装备。因之“治安可保无虞”。
