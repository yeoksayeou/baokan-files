Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th. Chiang Kai-shek's "Ceasefire Order" is actually a "Combat Order," as proven by a series of facts. (1) Hu Zongnan has concentrated troops for attacking Yan'an in Luochuan,中部 (Zhongbu), and Hancheng, Yichuan, and other places, and is reinforcing Yulin by air. Ma Hongda's troops have approached the border of Sanbian, and Chiang Kai-shek's air force has been harassing the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and the skies over Yan'an for days. (2) Chiang's army in Shandong occupied Ye County on the 11th. Chiang's army in Zaozhuang, southern Shandong, also launched an attack on the same day, coordinated with the air force and tanks. Chiang's air force bombed Lin Yi again on the 12th. (3) Chiang's army in Anyang, northern Henan, invaded Guantai on the day after the "ceasefire order" came into "effect". (4) Since the 11th, Chiang's army in the Jin-Cha-Ji region has occupied Wangdu and Lulong. (5) The enemy in Datong, northern Jin, launched an attack in several directions, occupying Yungang on the 11th and Daishan on the 12th. (6) Chiang's army in the Northeast also advanced north along the Sipingjie-Taonan Road, occupying Liaoyuan, Beifeng, and other places on the 11th. (7) In the Su-Wan area: Chiang's army harassed Shuyang and invaded Lianshui. The military and civilians in the liberated areas resolutely defended themselves and have achieved successive victories in the past week. The Eighth Route Army in Jiaodong, after capturing Pingdu, recovered Changyi and Shouguang on the 10th. On the 13th, they captured Qidong, and the Chiang's army that risked occupying Ye County is now in danger of being encircled. Along the Jiaoji Railway line, Chiang's army originally had five armies, but after scraping together some forces to invade Jiaodong and Bohai, it immediately showed signs of being unable to advance after being counterattacked by the local military and civilians. Now Chiang's side has transferred the entire 46th Division (original army), which was previously on Hainan Island, to Shandong, in an attempt to attack Pingdu again. Chiang's army that attacked from Zaozhuang and Taierzhuang desperately tried to open the Tai-Zao Railway, but suffered a setback on the evening of the 11th, losing 3,000 men. The Eighth Route Army in northern Jin counterattacked the Yan's army that was attacking, and in the early part of this month, successively recovered important strongholds of the Yan's army in areas such as Guangxian, Wutai, Dingxiang, Yuanping, Xinkou, and Pingshe. The city of Xinxian has been isolated. All the occupied areas southwest of Guanyun in northern Jiangsu have been recovered, and more than 1,000 invaders have been eliminated within half a month, effectively打击 (dǎ jī - striking a blow against) Chiang's attempt to cut off the transportation between the Jiangsu and Shandong liberated areas. Overall, although Chiang's army has tried to expand its offensive in the past week, its reserves are depleted and it cannot be reinforced, and the military crisis is deepening day by day. (From the 10th to the 16th)

　　一周战况
    企图扩大进攻反遭重创蒋军后备枯竭危机日深
    【新华社延安十七日电】蒋介石的“停战令”就是“作战令”，已为一连串事实所证明。（一）胡宗南已将进攻延安部队集结洛川、中部及韩城、宜川等地，并以空运增兵榆林。马鸿达部业已进逼三边边境，连日来蒋介石空军侵扰陕甘宁边区及延安上空。（二）山东蒋军于十一日占领掖县。鲁南枣庄蒋军配合空军、坦克亦于同日出犯，蒋家空军十二日再次轰炸临沂。（三）豫北安阳蒋军于停战令“生效”次日侵入观台。（四）晋察冀地区蒋军十一日以来，侵占望都、卢龙。（五）晋北大同敌人分路出犯，十一日占云岗，十二日占岱山。（六）东北蒋军亦沿四（平街）洮（南）路北犯，十一日侵占辽源、北丰等地。（七）苏皖方面：蒋军扰犯沭阳及侵犯涟水。解放区军民坚决自卫，一周来迭获胜利。胶东八路军继攻克平度后，十日又收复昌邑、寿光。十三日克齐东，现冒险侵据掖县蒋军，已有被夹击危险。胶济路一线，蒋军原有五个军，这次拚凑一些力量进犯胶东渤海，但一经当地军民反击，即呈无力进犯气象。现蒋方已将曾在海南岛的第四十六师（原军）悉数调到山东，图再犯平度。枣庄、台儿庄出犯蒋军，拚命打通台枣铁路，十一日晚受挫，损失三千人。晋北八路军反击出犯阎军，本月初旬相继收复崞县、五台、定襄、原平、忻口、平社等地阎军重要据点，忻县城已陷于孤立。苏北灌云西南被占地区，均告恢复，半月内消灭进犯者千余人，有效地打击了蒋方切断苏鲁解放区交通的企图。总观周来蒋军虽力图扩大进攻，但后备枯竭，无法增援，军事危机日益加深。（十日至十六日）
