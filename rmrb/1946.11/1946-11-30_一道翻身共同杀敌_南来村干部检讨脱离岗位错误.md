　　Overcoming Hardship Together to Kill the Enemy
    Village Cadres from the South Correct Their Mistake of Abandoning Their Posts
    [This newspaper, Ci County news] When news of the Chiang army preparing to attack Ci County reached Nanlai Village in the Second District of this county, some cadres and activists were panic-stricken, abandoned the masses, and fled to the old liberated area. At this time, Chiang's special agents took the opportunity to spread rumors, and the masses felt they had no one to rely on, so they complained about the cadres, which led to a lack of enthusiasm for delivering public grain and a lack of enthusiasm for preparing for war. Seeing this situation, cadres from neighboring villages went to the village to coordinate with the cadres who had stayed behind and convened a mass meeting to allow the masses to offer their opinions on the cadres who had left the village. At the meeting, one liberated peasant said, "We struggled and liberated ourselves together. The enemy hasn't even come yet, and they've already run away. What are we supposed to do?" In addition to explaining to the masses, the cadres immediately sent people to call them back. After the cadres who had left the village returned, they immediately participated in various mass groups and admitted their mistakes to the masses. They resolutely stated that if the enemy arrived, they would definitely be with everyone and lead the militia to resolutely attack the enemy and protect the masses. After the cadres expressed their views, the militiamen also stated: "As long as you are with us, even if we don't have guns, we will take up pitchforks and brooms to fight Chiang Kai-shek! We will carry stretchers and deliver supplies!" The women also stated: "You fight in the front, and we will cook and deliver soup in the back. We will fight him to the death!" After the meeting, the morale of the masses rose sharply. After delivering the public grain in two days, they helped each other hide grain and prepare for war. All the materials of the families of revolutionary martyrs and the orphans have now been moved out and buried.

　　一道翻身共同杀敌
    南来村干部检讨脱离岗位错误
    【本报磁县讯】本县二区南来村干部在备战中脱离群众，最近经过自我检讨已和群众打成一片，展开了备战工作。当蒋军准备进攻磁县的消息传至该村，部分干部和积极分子惊惶失措，即丢掉群众，逃往老区。此时蒋特趁机钻空造谣，群众感到没有依靠，就埋怨干部，以致送公粮不起劲，备战也不积极。邻村干部看到这种情况，即赴该村协同留村干部，召开群众大会，让群众给离村干部提意见，会上一个翻身群众说：“咱一块斗争一块翻身，敌人还没有来，他们就跑开了，丢下俺们怎办啦？”干部除向群众解释外，并立即派人把他们叫了回来。离村的干部回来后，立即分头参加各群众小组，向群众承认错误。并坚决表示如果敌人到来，一定和大家在一块，并带领民兵坚决打击敌人，掩护群众。干部表示后，自卫队员亦提出：“只要你们和我们在一起，我们没有枪，拿起杈耙、扫帚也要和蒋介石干！抬担架送东西都算俺啦！”妇女也提出：“你们在前面打，俺在后面做饭、送汤水，至死要和他拚！”会后群众情绪顿形高涨，并于二日内把公粮送完后，即互相帮助藏粮备战，现已把抗属孤寡的全部物资搬出和埋藏起来。
