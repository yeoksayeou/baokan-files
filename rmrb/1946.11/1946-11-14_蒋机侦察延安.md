Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, November 11th: At noon today, precisely the moment Chiang Kai-shek's so-called "ceasefire order" came into effect, a Chiang Kai-shek plane reconnoitered the area 20 kilometers east of Yan'an city. At 2:55 PM, another Chiang Kai-shek plane flew from the northwest over Yan'an city for reconnaissance and harassment, lingering for five minutes before fleeing south. Chiang Kai-shek's reconnaissance of Yan'an is clearly related to Chiang Kai-shek's preparations to attack the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and Yan'an. Chiang Kai-shek's so-called ceasefire order was torn up by himself immediately at the time he announced it would take effect.

    蒋机侦察延安
    【新华社延安十一日】今日正午十二时正是蒋介石的所谓“停战令”生效时刻，蒋机一架，侦察延安市东郊廿公里处地区；午后两点五十五分时，又有蒋机一架，从西北方面飞临延安市上空侦扰，历时五分钟始向南逸去。蒋机侦察延安，显与蒋介石准备进攻陕甘宁边区与延安行动关联，蒋氏所谓停战令，正在他宣布的生效时间，立即被他自己撕毁。
