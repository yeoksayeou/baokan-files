    Rural Notes from Wuxiang (Two)
    Zheng Du
    New Life, New Enthusiasm
    Around Panlong, I visited more than a dozen villages. What impressed me most was the masses' enthusiasm for production and construction, and their regular and organized daily life.

    Cooperatives and mutual aid societies exist in almost every village, and their scale is not small. Dyeing workshops, oil mills, and vinegar workshops are being established for all tasks that supply the daily needs of the masses and are closely related to them.

    The Liyu Village originally had an oil mill, but after the Japanese devils burned, killed, and looted during the Anti-Japanese War, no one had pressed oil for seven or eight years. On the day I arrived in the village, the oil mill had just been rebuilt, and it was pressing oil for the first time. The master craftsman was Wei Laiyou, an old hand at oil pressing in the village. Although he hadn't pressed oil for many years, he was still very skilled when he started. The main beam and oil trough were all brand new, and he handled them with ease. From his efforts to appear experienced and calm, it was clear that he was happy and satisfied. A crowd of adults and children surrounded him, as if they had never seen oil being pressed before. They all craned their necks to watch, and from time to time they clicked their tongues in praise: "Truly an old master! Truly an old master!"

    Indeed, production and construction have formed a top-down movement. No matter which village or hamlet, as long as a new thing is planned, the whole village feels as happy as if they were celebrating a big event.

    Peasants who used to live a scattered life now live an organized and regular life. The villages I visited all have large clocks or substitutes for clocks—rail tracks (these are war trophies).

    The Dongbu Red Flag Brigade, with a total of eight squads, each has its own clock. They are very familiar with the sound of the clock. As soon as the clock rings, people can immediately tell which squad's clock it is.

    When I was walking from the Second District to the First District, it was the time of intense autumn harvest in various villages. Guanjianaou does not have a clock, but every night after dinner, the rail track hanging on the high ground in the middle of the village rings loudly. In order to launch a concentrated effort to cut the grain, they gather every night. Nanxiang Huangbian Village has neither a clock nor a rail track, but they have their own bugler.

    The organization of the militia is even more obvious. When they hear the assembly whistle or bugle call, they immediately run over in twos and threes, accompanied by songs or playful banter. But as soon as a meeting is announced, all the chaotic sounds immediately disappear, and it becomes as quiet as a graveyard.

    In this organized and regular life, a new character—solemnity and liveliness—has been cultivated among all people, even the elderly.
  Certificates of Merit and Badges
    In every village I visited, the easiest things to see were certificates of merit and badges. This is a major feature of Wuxiang's leadership work. Whenever a family receives a certificate of merit, they rush to paste it on the wall, and if it's a badge, they always pin it on their lapel. People take this as an honor.

    In Qinjiayan, I once visited Li Xingyun. He is a well-known enemy-killing hero in the entire Taihang area. When I saw him, he had three badges neatly hanging on his chest, one awarded by the county, one by the sub-district, and one by the military region. Obviously, he attaches great importance to his glorious symbol—the badge. He often wears them, even when going to the fields.

    In every job position, as long as people have a special skill or advantage, they will immediately receive praise or rewards from their superiors. Therefore, a mass-based form of praise and commendation has naturally formed among the masses. Jiang Guozhen, a teacher in Momai Village, teaches very conscientiously. During the Mid-Autumn Festival, the masses and cadres presented him with a flag and praised him everywhere: "He is a good teacher!"
  Joyful Songs Everywhere
    Before the Anti-Japanese War, land in Wuxiang was very concentrated. There was a saying circulating in the countryside: "Four great families, eight small families, and seventy-two families barely scraping by." At that time, almost all the land in Wuxiang County was occupied by those "great" families and "small" families. Therefore, there are now many emancipated people and villages in Wuxiang.

    When you walk through the layers of beautiful villages that are stacked or intricately mixed and hanging on the golden mountain ridges, and look from afar, the verdant trees are dotted around or in the middle of them. The quiet and beautiful scene really makes people stop. But when you get closer and listen carefully, you can hear the low singing of young women who are working by the door or spinning under the shade of trees, and the noisy voices of children chasing pigs and sheep.

    The spinning wheel hums out a slight rhythm, and the calm hearts of the spinners beat with the rhythm. At this time, the "blooming tune" that they are usually familiar with is softly uttered from their mouths. Everyone is familiar with the tune, but the lyrics are each person's inner emotions.

    "The golden needle blooms with five yellow petals, joining the victorious army, its name will be famous for all time!"

    "The door is ajar, not coming, what wind has blown you here?"

    Who is thinking of her man who went to join the army? Who is thinking of her gentle lover? However, suddenly the singing changes. A young shepherd boy shouts at the herd of sheep and sings loudly:

    "Ah—Whoosh—
    The sun blooms a red flower, carrying stretchers to stand guard and send wounded soldiers.
    The chili is red, with a green lid, having joined the victorious army, protecting the fruits."

    In the emancipated villages, the songs of the emancipated people can be heard at any time. Even in the busiest or most tense moments, songs still accompany them. For example, when the enemy occupied Panlong, the villagers in Yaoshanggou, who were two or three miles away from the enemy, often sang the "Sparrow Warfare" song. The loud singing reached the enemy's bunkers, but people were not afraid at all, and the joyful singing continued to stir:

    "Steel guns never leave the shoulder,
      Iron hoes never leave the hand,
      Hey!
      Farmers, come forward quickly,
      Let's have a sparrow war!"

    武乡乡居杂记（二）
    郑笃
    新的生活新的热情
    在蟠龙周围，我跑了有十多个村，印象最深的是群众生产建设的热情与有规律有组织的作息生活。
    合作社互助社几乎村村都有，规模也不算小，染坊、油坊、醋坊，凡是供给群众日常需用和与群众关联最紧密的作业，都在建立。
    李峪村原先也有个油坊，抗战后因日本鬼子烧杀抢掠，七八年即无人榨过油。当我到达该村的那天，油坊刚刚修盖起，而且第一次榨油。大师傅是该村榨油老手魏来有，他虽多年没榨油，但动起手来还是很熟练。大梁、油槽，一切全是崭新的，使起来也还得心应手，从他的极力要使自己显得老练，从容不迫的精神上，很明显的可以看出他的欢喜与满意。在他的周围，挤着一群大人小孩，仿佛全未见过榨油似的，都伸长着脖子在观看，不时还发出啧啧的称赞：“真是老把式！真是老把式！”
    的确，生产建设已形成了一个自上而下的运动，不论那村那庄，只要筹划起一宗新事情，全村的人，都会感到像是在办什么大喜事似的欢快。
    一向过着散漫生活的农民，现在已过起有组织有规律的生活来了。我所到过的村庄都按置有大钟或钟的代替物——铁轨（这是战利品）。
    东堡红旗大队，共八个分队，各队都有自己的钟。对于钟声，他们非常熟习，只要钟声一响，人们立刻能辨出那是那队的钟声。
    当我由二区走向一区的时候，正值各村紧张秋收。关家瑙是没有钟的，但每夜一吃完晚饭，挂在村当中高地上的铁轨，即当当当的响起来。为了突击割谷，他们是每夜集会。南响黄编村没有钟也没有铁轨，但他们有自己的号兵。
    民兵的组织性更可明显的看出。当他们一听到集合的哨声或号音，三三五五立即伴随着歌声或打闹着跑来。但只要一宣布开会，一切杂乱的声音，立即消失，显得鸦雀无声。
    在这种有组织有规律的生活中，一种新的性格——严肃与活泼，已经在所有人中间养成，甚至老年人也是一样。
  奖状与胸章
    走到每个村里，最容易看到的是奖状和胸章。这是武乡领导工作上的一个很大特点。谁家家里，只要得到一张奖状，就赶忙贴到墙上，倘是胸章则一定别在衣襟上。人们都以此为光荣。
    在秦家岩，我曾去访问过李星云。他是一位出名全太行区的杀敌英雄。我见到他时，在他的胸前整齐的挂着三个胸章，一个是县上奖的，一个是分区的，一个是军区的。显然他对于他那光荣的标志——胸章，是异常重视的。他经常的带着它们，甚至下地时也带着。
    在各个工作岗位上，人们只要有一特长与优点，立刻就会得到上级的表扬或奖励。因此，在群众之间也自然的形成了一种群众性的表扬与嘉奖。陌麦村教员姜国祯，教学很认真，群众干部们在中秋节时，即献给他一面旗，而且到处赞扬着：“那可是个好教员！”
  到处洋溢着愉快的歌声
    抗战前，武乡土地很集中，乡间曾流行着：“四大家，八小家，还有七十二户圪撑家”的传说。当时武乡全县的土地，差不多全被那些“大”家和“小”家所占有了。因此，武乡现在翻身人和翻身村特别多。
    当你走过那层层如叠或错综参杂悬挂在金黄色的山圪梁上的美丽村落时，远远望去，翠绿的树丛点缀在它们的四围或中间，那种恬静幽美的景象，真使人留步，但当你走近侧耳细听，即能听到依在门边作活或坐在树荫下纺线的青年妇女们低低的歌声，和追逐着猪羊玩耍的孩子们的嘈叫声。
    纺车嗡嗡的发出轻微的节奏，纺妇们平静的心随着节拍在跳动。一到这时，为她们平素唱熟悉了的开花调，就轻轻的从她们口里吐出来。调子是谁都熟悉的，但歌词却是每个人自己内心的情感。
    “金针开花五瓣黄，参加胜利军，万古名扬！”
    “门搭搭，不来来，什风刮上你来来？”
    是谁想起了她的去参军了的男人？是谁想起了她温柔的情人？然而，忽的唱声变了，一个青年的牧童吆喝着羊群，在高唱：
    “啊——吁吁——
    太阳开花一朵红，担架放哨送伤兵。
    辣椒红，绿盖盖，参加了胜利军，保卫果实。”
    在翻了身的村庄，翻身人的歌声随时都可听到，即在最忙碌或最紧张的时候，歌声仍然伴随着他们。如敌人占据蟠龙时，距敌人二三里的窑上沟的老乡们，就时常唱着“打麻雀战”歌。嘹亮的歌声，传到了敌人的堡垒，但人们一点也不畏惧，愉快的歌声继续在激荡：
    “钢枪不离肩，
      铁锄不离手，
      喂！
      庄稼哥儿快上前，
      来一个麻雀战！”
