Wherever Chiang's troops go, fields are barren, and villages are destroyed. They want to completely destroy the people's happy lives. In Shatuji on the Heze-Jining road, forty-three young people were captured by Chiang's troops, five hundred and forty-five trees were cut down, all the chickens, pigs, and sheep were eaten, young women were all insulted, and the value of damaged clothing and furniture exceeded 20 million yuan, making it impossible for the masses to live. Our ×× Regiment of a certain sub-district of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Military Region, upon being ordered to strike Chiang's troops in the Shatuji area, took advantage of the gaps in battle to help the masses restore their lives. We gathered all the livestock of the unit to help them with the autumn plowing. The land of more than twenty families was plowed, and fifty-nine mu of wheat were also planted. Every day, one-third of the personnel were also used to help the masses repair houses and fetch water, and the village government was established. The old ladies said, "We will never forget our Eighth Route Army!" Several young people insisted on kowtowing to the commander of our ×× Regiment and hated Chiang Kai-shek to the core, gnashing their teeth and cursing, "That old Chiang, the turtle son, will never have a good death sooner or later!"

　　爱与恨
    蒋军所至，田园荒芜，村庄毁灭，他们要彻底的破坏人民幸福的生活。在荷（泽）济（宁）路上的沙土集，年青人被蒋军抓走四十三个，砍倒树木五百四十五棵，鸡猪羊吃得净光，青年妇女全被侮辱，损坏的衣物家具价值超过两千万元，群众已无法生活。我冀鲁豫某分区××团，奉命至沙土集一带打击蒋军时，利用战斗空隙帮助群众恢复生活，把部队所有的牲口集合起来帮助他们秋耕，二十多家的地耕了，还种了五十九亩麦子，每天还用三分之一的人员帮助群众修屋、打水，并把村政权建立起来。老太太们说：“什么时候也忘不了咱八路军！”几个年青人非给我××团团长磕头不可，对蒋介石恨之入骨，咬牙切齿骂道：“老蒋那个龟孙迟早总不得好死！”【本报冀鲁豫前线电】
