　　Taihang Issues Order to All Counties
　　Rectify Rural Drama Troupes
　　[Our Newspaper Changzhi News] The Taihang Administrative Office has recently issued an order to all counties in the region to rectify rural drama troupes. Due to the emancipation of the masses in Taihang, many rural drama troupes have spontaneously organized this year. However, many are restorations of old opera troupes and still require vigorous transformation. The order specifically points out that local drama troupes should clearly promote the characteristics of rural drama troupes where emancipated masses sing, play, and enjoy themselves in their spare time, correct the style of old opera troupes, and transform old opera troupes, old artists, and old plays. In order to better serve the war, border area drama troupes should not only be good at concentrating on performing large-scale operas, but also be good at flexibly dispersing to perform small-scale operas, storytelling with drum accompaniment, and clapper talks. The content should focus on encouraging the people and soldiers of the entire region to have confidence in the victory of the patriotic self-defense war, praising the emancipation of the masses, and preparing for next year's large-scale production. Currently, the number of rural drama troupes has increased unprecedentedly. Each county should equip its supervisors with cadres who have experience and interest in drama work to strengthen leadership and conduct an inspection of this year's policy focusing on mass education. The Third Special District has convened a drama troupe meeting and held a drama writing competition. Each region should strengthen this work.

　　太行通令各县
    整顿农村剧团
    【本报长治讯】太行行署顷通令全区各县整顿农村剧团。太行各地由于群众翻身，今年自发组织起来的农村剧团很多，但不少是旧戏班恢复，尚需大力改造。通令特指出：各地剧团应明确发扬翻身群众业余自乐自唱的农村剧团特质，纠正旧戏班作风，改造旧戏班，旧艺人与旧剧。为更好的为战争服务，边地剧团不仅要善于集中起来演大戏，而且要善于灵活分散唱小戏、说大鼓、快板等。内容以鼓动全区军民爱国自卫战争胜利信心、歌颂群众翻身、准备明年大生产为中心。目前农村剧团数量空前增加，各县应在督学中配备对戏剧工作有经验，有兴趣的干部，加强领导，并对今年以大众教育为重点的方针作一检查。三专区已召集剧团会议，举行剧作评选，各地区应加强这一工作。
