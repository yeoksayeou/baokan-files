The Destruction of the Nationalist Troops in Yangquan
Zhang Fuqiang

On the night of October 25th, on the plains five or six li away from Shuiye, the villagers lit bonfires of firewood and dry grass everywhere, the enemy wanting to use that weak light to drive away the darkness around them and boost their courage.

The company stationed in Yangquan was an elite assault force of the 40th Division, wearing American-style red-skinned sun hats and carrying American crooked-handle machine guns. From their chest badges, it could be seen that they were the Second Company, First Battalion, 316th Regiment, 106th Brigade. From the prisoners, it was learned that they were a specially treated main force.

They were afraid to recall the events of the day: during the day, they had two regiments of men, two airplanes, six tanks, three armored vehicles, five mountain guns, four heavy guns, three infantry guns, and countless American machine guns and rifles, to attack Shuiye. Under the earth-shattering artillery fire, all the charges were repelled. More than 800 people were killed, wounded, and captured, and corpses floated along the river. In the evening, a few skinny cows were transporting a broken tank on the road.

The more they thought about the tragedy of the day, the more firewood they threw into the fire, making it burn brighter.

At 10:00 PM, the main force of the 7th Regiment was ordered to attack the enemy in Yangquan from Siduan Village. They advanced rapidly eastward under the starlight.

As soon as the gunshots rang out, the enemy discovered the Second Company. The Third Platoon rushed towards the enemy by the fires near the river ditch. Battalion Commander Niu Shude ran behind the grave mounds and set up a heavy machine gun. Under the fierce barrage, the soldiers rushed towards the south gate along a sunken path. Next to a pool, the enemy threw grenades from the fortifications, and landmines made loud noises, emitting black smoke several feet high and a ball of red fire. They encountered fierce resistance from the enemy, but quickly drove them into the village.

Just as gunshots were ringing out from the south and northwest corners, Seventh Company Commander Zhang Fuchun said in a low voice to Battalion Commander Zhou, "They haven't discovered us yet." The assault team secretly approached the fortifications on the west side. The enemy fled in panic. Before Battalion Commander Zhou could organize fire, the assault team climbed over the walls with the sound of gunfire.

First Squad Leader Han Chengyu ran at the front. He didn't think to call all the squad members to follow him, but climbed over several walls alone, quickly passed through the open space where the fire was burning brightly, and fiercely pursued a dozen enemies, throwing grenades.

The frantically fleeing enemies ran all the way to the east end of the village along the street. Only when they discovered that there was only one person chasing them did they begin to counterattack. Dense shrapnel from the bombs wounded Comrade Han Chengyu's chest. He thrust forward with his bayonet, and a dozen enemies surrounded him and never let go. Two bayonets were deeply inserted into his waist, and his tall and strong body fell to the ground.

All the enemies were hiding in the houses of four courtyards. Two tall buildings stood high, and a bunker was close to the courtyard wall. Soldiers of the Seventh and Eighth Companies tightly surrounded them.

Grenades and all kinds of gunfire were fired from the high buildings, the gun holes of the bunker, the windows, and the courtyard, exploding, whistling strangely, emitting thick smoke, and the stinky bombs made people cough loudly.

Eighth Company Commander Zheng Cunren shouted on the roof, "Machine gun up!" A burst of grenades was fired from the high building, and two comrades fell from the ladder with a wave of their hands. The swivel machine gun was damaged, and the second machine gun was immediately set up on the roof.

Fourth Squad Leader of the Seventh Company, He Yunlong, flipped over and climbed onto the roof. "I'm up!" he shouted loudly, and his assault team immediately followed. Grenades flew far from their hands, making deafening booms.

The enemy's gun holes and high rooftops were blocked by a tight net of fire. People on the roof threw bombs into the houses, and people under the houses worked hard to make holes in the brick walls.

The gates of two courtyards were blown open, and Han Xibao, the Second Platoon Leader of the Eighth Company, was the first to rush in. The enemy counterattacked from the houses into the courtyard. A row of grenades drove them out of the courtyard, and then they rushed in again. Han Xibao carried a basket of grenades, stood upright in the center of the courtyard, and threw a grenade towards the high building and the side room, shouting, "Surrender!" His hoarse voice expressed very stern and hateful emotions.

The enemy was pressed into a courtyard. Han Xibao swayed out with an empty basket, bumping into Political Commissar Peng Bo of the battalion at the door. "Political Commissar, my leg hurts a little. Can you feel if I'm wounded?" He reached out and touched it, and his pants were all wet. Peng Bo told him that he was wounded and told him to go down quickly. He refused to listen to him and insisted on continuing to fight. "Comrade!" the political commissar affectionately called to him, "Completing the revolutionary task is not just today, you can make contributions in the future." After speaking, he immediately sent two soldiers to pull him down forcibly. Han Xibao looked at the political commissar, who was small in stature, his face still full of his usual lively and happy expression, and didn't know what to say.

The enemy's corpses were lying scattered in the courtyard, and a burst of screams came from the dark place: "Company Commander, I'm injured, please open the door and let me in!" But no one answered in the high building, only some groaning sounds.

At this time, my Seventh Company commander shouted loudly in the corner of the wall: "Surrender and you won't be killed, the Eighth Route Army will treat you well." "Patriotic soldiers, don't be fooled by the traitor Chiang Kai-shek."

The answer was a burst of machine gun roar.

Several soldiers were extremely angry: "Charge, Company Commander, there are special agents inside who are controlling them and not letting them surrender, let's go in and take them out!"

"Not so fast."

"Are you really not surrendering, or are you pretending not to surrender?"

"We'll give you bullets, fight!" After a reply, dense machine gun bullets flew out from the second floor.

The Seventh Squad Leader of the Eighth Company climbed to the base of the wall, found the place where the brick wall was, and then quickly ran outside the courtyard and brought in engineers. He tapped the wall with his hand, personally pointed out the location to the engineers, and 30 kilograms of yellow explosives were placed at the base of the wall.

After a period of silence, the troops withdrew from the courtyard.

With a deafening roar, the American-equipped Nationalist assault team was completely buried in the dark, thick smoke.

    羊圈蒋军的毁灭
    张富强
    十月二十五日的夜晚，离开水冶五六里的平原上，到处点燃了老乡们的木柴和干草堆，敌人想借那微弱的火光，驱走身边的黑暗来壮壮胆子。
    住在羊圈的一个连，是四十师精锐的突击部队，戴着美国式的红皮遮阳软盘盘帽子，拿着美国歪柄机枪，从他们的胸章上看出他们是一○六旅三一六团一营二连，从俘虏口中听出他们是受特别待遇的主力。
    他们害怕回想白天的事情：白天，他们两团人，两架飞机，六辆坦克车，三辆装甲车，五门山炮，四门重炮，三门步兵炮，还有数不清的美国机枪和步枪，去进攻水冶，在打得昏天黑地的炮火下面，所有的冲锋都被击退。死伤和被俘的有八百多人，死尸随着河水飘浮，晚上几只瘦牛在公路上搬运一辆残破的坦克车。
    他们一想起白天的悲惨，就投入更多的柴草到火堆里，让火燃得旺些。

    夜晚十点钟，七团的主力奉命从四段村向羊圈的敌人出击，他们在星光下向着东方迅速的前进。
    枪声一响，二连给敌人发现了，三排向河沟里火堆旁的敌人扑去，一营长牛书德奔向坟堆后面架起了重机枪，在猛烈的火网下，战士们顺着一条凹道冲向南门，在一个水池旁边，敌人从工事里打出手榴弹来，地雷发出大的声响，冒起几丈高的黑烟，一团红火，他们遇到敌人猛烈的抵抗，但很快就把敌人赶进了村子。
    正当南面和西北角枪响的时候，七连长张富春低声向周营长说：“还没有发现我们。”突击组秘密的接近到西面工事跟前，敌人惊惶的逃走了，还没有等到周营长组织火力，突击组随着枪声就上了墙头。
    一班长韩成玉跑在最前面，他没有想到叫全班战士跟上他，独自翻过几道围墙，飞快的通过了烧着大火的空场，猛追着十几个敌人，投掷着手榴弹。
    狂奔的敌人顺着大街一直跑到村东头，当他们一发现追来的只有一个人的时候，才开始了反扑。密集的炸弹的破片，打伤了韩成玉同志的胸部，他挺着刺刀向前猛刺，十几个敌人围着他始终不放松，两把刺刀深深地插进他的腰部，他高大健壮的身体倒在地上。
          ×      ×      ×
    全部敌人躲藏在四座院子的屋子里，两座楼房高高的立着，一座碉堡靠近院子的围墙，七连和八连的战士，紧紧的包围着它。
    手榴弹和各种各样的枪火，从高楼上。碉堡的枪眼里，窗户里和院子里发射出来，爆炸着，发着怪声呼啸着，冒着浓烈的烟雾，散发着臭气的炸弹使人大声的呛咳着。
    八连长郑存仁在房顶上叫着：“机枪上来。”一阵手榴弹从高楼上打下来，两个同志从梯子上一扬手倒了下去，转盘机枪打坏了，第二挺机枪马上就在房顶上架起来。
    七连四班长何云龙一翻身上了房，“我上来了！”他大声吼叫着，他的突击组立刻跟了上去，手榴弹从他们手中远远的飞出，发着震耳的轰声。
    敌人的枪眼和高房顶被严密的火网封锁着，房上的人向房子里扔进炸弹去，房下的人努力朝着砖墙打着洞。
    两座院子的大门炸开了，八连二排长韩希宝首先冲进去，敌人从房子里反扑到院子里，一排手榴弹把他们打得退出了院子，接着他们又冲了进去。韩希宝挎了一篮手榴弹，直立在院子中央，向着高楼和佩房扔一颗手榴弹喊一声：“缴枪！”他嘶哑的嗓音中表现着十分严厉和憎恨的感情。
    敌人被压到一个院子里，韩希宝挎着空篮子一摇一摆的出来，在门边撞着营政委彭波。“政委，我的腿有些疼，你摸摸看是不是挂彩了？”他伸手一摸，裤子都湿透了：彭波告给他挂了彩，要他快下去，他不听他的话，非再干不行，“同志！”政委亲切的喊着他：“完成革命任务不是今天一天，以后还可以立功。”说完立即派两名战士把他硬拉下去，韩希宝瞧着政委这个小个子，脸上仍然充满平时活泼愉快的表情，不知该说什么话才好。

    院子里横七竖八躺满了敌人的尸体，一阵惨叫从黑暗的地方发出来：“连长呀，我负伤了，你开一下门叫我进去啊！”高楼里却没有人回答，只有一些呻吟的声音。
    这时我七连连长在墙角里大声的喊着：“缴枪不杀，八路军优待你们。”“爱国军人不要上了卖国贼蒋介石的当。”
    回答的是一阵机枪的狂吼。
    几个战士气极了：“冲吧，连长，里头有特务掌握不叫缴枪，进去挑了他们吧！”
    “不忙。”
    “你们到底真不缴枪，还是假不缴枪？”
    “缴给你子弹头，打！”在一声回答之后，稠密的机枪弹从二层楼上飞出来。
    八连七班长爬到墙根去，摸到砖墙所在的地方，然后迅速跑到院子外面带着工兵进来，用手在墙上敲了敲，亲自指了地点给工兵，三十公斤黄色炸药安在墙根里。
    一阵沉寂之后，部队撤出了院子。
    震天一声巨响，美式蒋军的突击队被完全埋藏在昏黑的浓烟里。
