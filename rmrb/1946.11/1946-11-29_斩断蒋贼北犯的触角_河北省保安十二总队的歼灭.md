Severing Chiang Bandit's Northern Extension
The Annihilation of the Hebei Provincial Security Twelfth Regiment

The Chiang-affiliated Hebei Provincial Independent Brigade, entrenched in Hezhai and Lizhuang within Hua County, south of Puyang, was suddenly attacked by our troops on the evening of the 18th and declared annihilated. Immediately after, the soldiers constructed fortifications, preparing to annihilate what remained of He Guansan's core forces – the Hebei Provincial Security Twelfth Regiment – the next day. This was a team utterly loathed by the people of northern Henan and western Shandong. Its First Battalion was stationed in Hancun, while the Second, Third Battalions, and the regimental headquarters were stationed in Zhulou, the two villages being less than a li apart. It was Chiang Kai-shek's extension for this offensive against Puyang. As the sun set on the 19th, and the hands of the clock pointed to 3:25 pm, the assault team of the Eighth Company, led by Platoon Leader Zhou Xuegu, swiftly scaled the walls. Before long, the majority of the enemy in the First Battalion was eliminated. A small number of enemies attempting to break through and escape were also intercepted by us. Our right-wing forces, guided by the assault teams of the Ninth Company's Meng Shaoliang and the Third Company's Li Shanyuan, also rapidly stormed into Zhulou. He Guansan's lackeys, seeing our brave warriors ascending the village walls, no longer had the courage to fight. They fled in all directions, and the brave warriors who were lying in wait outside the village to capture fleeing soldiers pursued and surrounded them. The wilderness was filled with shouts, and everywhere the sound of pleading for mercy could be heard. He Guansan, relying on his seven years of experience, believed that "I haven't been eliminated by the Eighth Route Army in the past seven or eight years, so this time they will still be helpless against me." It was not until the brave warriors stormed the walls that he woke up. But as soon as he jumped out of the fortress wall, he was shot by our ambushers who had been waiting there for a long time. His attendant orderly was about to carry him away when Instructor Gao of our First Battalion caught up. He Guansan and his deputy regimental commander, Qiu Limin, along with a dozen others, were all taken prisoner.

　　斩断蒋贼北犯的触角
    河北省保安十二总队的歼灭
    盘据我濮阳以南滑县境内贺砦、李庄之蒋记河北省独立大队，在十八日晚上遭我某部突然打击，宣告溃灭后，战士们马上构筑工事，准备在第二天歼灭何冠三剩下的基本部队——河北省保安十二总队。这是豫北、鲁西人民痛恨透骨的一支团队，其一大队驻韩村，二、三大队及总队部驻朱楼，两村相距不及一里。它是蒋介石这次进攻濮阳的触角。十九日太阳西下了，时针已指向三点廿五分，第八连的突击组在排长周学顾率领下，神速地登上围墙，不大一会，把一大队敌人大部被解决了，企图突围逃窜的少数敌人，也被我截获了。我右翼部队在九连孟绍良、三连李善元同志的突击组引导下，也迅速突进了朱楼。何冠三的喽罗们见到我们的勇士已突上寨墙，再也没有勇气鏖战了。他们四面逃跑，预伏在村外捉溃兵的勇士，都跟踪追击包围，漫野里充满了喊声，到处都听到求饶的哀告。何冠三凭借他七年的老经验，认为“过去七八年我都没被八路军消灭了，这次他一定还是莫可奈何的”。等到勇士们突上围墙，他才清醒过来，但当他一跳出砦墙，就被我们在那里等候多时的伏兵打中了，他的随从马弁正想架着他溜走，我一营高教导员追上了，何冠三和他的副总队长邱立民十多个人，就一齐作了俘虏。            （夏川）
