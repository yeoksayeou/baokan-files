[Report from this newspaper in Weixian] West of Beifengzheng Village in Jize, on the banks of the Niuwu River, across twenty *li* of fertile fields, two new villages are now being built: one named Xinfengzheng (New Fengzheng), and the other, Kuaile Cun (Happy Village). This fertile land originally belonged to the farmers of Beifengzheng and Niuzhuang areas; after the Kuomintang, especially during the period of enemy and puppet rule, traitors, bullies, and landlords seized it from the farmers. The farmers swallowed their anger, and many fled due to famine. After our army liberated the area last year, through struggles such as rent reduction, debt clearing, land redemption, and the fight against traitors and bullies, the farmers finally recovered this fertile land. The refugees who heard the news and returned all regained their land. In order to be closer to their land so that they could cultivate it better, and also to give a firm and definite answer to the counter-offensive conspiracy of certain plunderers, the farmers decided to move here to live. More than thirty households in Beifengzheng are currently constructing new houses day and night, five *li* away from the village, accompanied by loud voices and songs. While constructing, they repeatedly deliberated and gave this soon-to-be-built new village a name that everyone was satisfied with, called "Xinfengzheng." The farmers of Niuzhuang built a new village not far away, which they named "Kuaile Cun." Both names mean that everyone should forever remember this "newborn joy." The county government, upon hearing this, recently plans to lend them one hundred *shi* of grain to help them settle down. (Lin)

　　斗垮奸霸难民重归故土
    牛庄一带农民建新村
    鸡泽县府拟借粮百石帮助安家
    【本报威县讯】鸡泽北风正村西，牛屋河岸，纵横二十里的一块肥美的田野上，现正建立着两个新村：一名新风正，一名快乐村。这片肥田，原为北风正、牛庄一带农民所有；经过国民党特别是敌伪统治时期，汉奸、恶霸、地主们把它从农民手里掠夺去了。农民忍气吞声，逃荒出走者极多。去年我军解放该地后，农民经过减租、清债、赎地、反汉奸恶霸等总清算斗争，终于将这块肥田又收了回来。闻风而归的逃亡难民，都重新获得自己的土地。为了和自己的土地更接近些，以便把它种得更好；也为了给某些掠夺者的反攻阴谋以坚决肯定的回答，农民决心迁移到这里来住。北风正的三十多家，现正在离村五里之处响着嘹亮的语声与歌声，夜以继日的修盖着新屋。一面修盖，一面经过再三推敲，给这即将建好的新村起了个大家都满意的名字，叫做“新风正”。牛庄的农民在相距不远之处建立的新村，则起名叫“快乐村”。含义都是叫大家永远记念着这“新生的愉快。”县府闻悉，最近正拟以一百石粮食借给他们，帮助他们安家。（林）
