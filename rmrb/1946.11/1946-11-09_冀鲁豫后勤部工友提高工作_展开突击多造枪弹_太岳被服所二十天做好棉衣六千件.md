　　[This newspaper JiluYu 4th dispatch] Spurred on by the continuous victories at the front, the workers of the military region's logistics department launched a production crash program, achieving great results. Fearing that the supplies would not be enough for the needs of the front lines and that they would let down the heroes at the front, they excitedly said, "The front lines are winning such great victories, we must work even harder!" So, they proposed competitions to each other, striving to become labor heroes. With the unanimous agreement of all the workers, it was decided to increase the daily working hours to ten hours, with no holidays on Sundays. Li Cunxin and Luo Hanjiu, the leaders of the bomb factory, proposed a plan to saw 20,000 handles in a month, while the workers in the sand-casting team guaranteed to double their output compared to the past, producing ×10,000 shell casings in a month; the grooms also held meetings to determine their own plans, renovating pots and stoves, saving firewood and grain, and cutting green grass to feed the horses well. After the crash program began, work efficiency greatly increased. Comrade Liu Weimin used to make 100 grab hooks a day, but now he can make 198 a day, doubling his output. Li Cunxin and Luo Hanjiu have already exceeded their original plan for sawing handles by a quarter. Xiong Mingchao, a repairman, has exceeded his working speed by three-fifths and is recognized by everyone as the number one shock worker. Wang Shaobin, an administrator in his fifties, and Rong Guangen, a quartermaster, both with disabilities in one hand, also volunteered to help load trucks, carrying mortars and heavy machine guns, loading six large trucks in one go. The deputy director of the armory was sick in bed when he heard that bullets were being sent to the front and jumped out of bed saying, "Comrades, hurry up! Don't delay the combat missions at the front." He carried 200 boxes of bullets in one go before stopping. Currently, the crash program is being enthusiastically carried out in all departments of the logistics department.

　　[This newspaper Yangcheng 3rd dispatch] All the staff of the supply department's uniform factory have completed the crash program to make winter cotton military uniforms to ensure that the front-line troops do not freeze. After the transfer of the uniform factory, the staff, regardless of rest, began to work nervously before everything was settled. Recently, each factory is increasing night work and voluntary work to complete the cotton clothing plan in a crash program. The Second Factory stipulates that each night three hours of processing are done, but the working hours of each shift have exceeded this time, and the output has increased by two-fifths. In twenty-one days of October, 6,420 cotton clothes were completed, exceeding the daily output in September by thirty-six pieces. And with ten days of crash work, 1,500 hours of voluntary night work were added, completing 15,000 military caps.

　　[This newspaper JiluYu 4th dispatch] Women in Houshen Dangtou Village, Qingfeng Second District, in order to support the front line and defeat Chiang Kai-shek's offensive, organized eight groups to sew cotton-padded clothes for the uniform factory. They said, "We can't be soldiers, and we can't carry stretchers or deliver bullets to the front. Now that the weather is cold, the front-line soldiers need cotton-padded clothes. This is the time for us to repay them." Forty people a day do the work, and everyone works hard, not willing to rest for a moment. In less than a month, they completed 1,000 sets of cotton clothes, sewn well and strong.

　　冀鲁豫后勤部工友提高工作
    展开突击多造枪弹
    太岳被服所二十天做好棉衣六千件
    【本报冀鲁豫四日电】在前线不断胜利的鼓舞下，军区后勤部工友展开了生产突击运动，得到了极大的成绩。他们惟恐供给不够前线的需要，对不起前线的英雄们，他们兴奋的说：“前线打这样大的胜仗，咱们更得加油干呵！”于是，他们互相提出竞赛，争取做劳动英雄。经全体工友一致同意，决定增加每日工作时间到十小时，星期日不休假。炸弹厂的班长李存心和罗汉九提出一个月锯两万个把子的计划，翻沙班的工友则保证比过去提高一倍产量，一月出×万个壳子；伙马夫们也开会定出自己的计划，改造锅、炉，节省柴粮，割青草把马喂好。突击开始后，工作效率大大提高。刘卫民同志以前每天造一百个扒子钩，现在一天能造一百九十八个，产量增加一倍。李存心和罗汉九锯把子，已超过原计划四分之一。修械工人熊名朝的工作速度则已超过五分之三，被大家公认为第一名突击手。五十多岁的管理员王绍宾和司务长荣光恩，都是一只手的残废，也都自动帮助装大车，扛迫击炮，重机枪，一气就装好了六大车。军械库副库长正在病中，听说给前方送子弹，从床上跳下来说：“同志们快呀！不要耽误了前方的战斗任务。”他一气搬了二百箱子弹才停止。目前，突击运动正在后勤各部门中热烈开展着。
    【本报阳城三日电】军区供给部被服所全体职工，突击完成今冬棉军衣，保证前线部队不受冻。被服×所转移后，职工们不顾休息，一切尚未安置就绪便又紧张的开始工作。最近各所正增加夜工、义务工，突击完成棉衣计划。二所每夜规定加工三个钟头，但各班工时都有超过，产量提高了五分之二。十月份二十一天内完成了棉衣六千四百二十件，比九月每天产量超过三十六件。并以十天突击，增加义务夜工一千五百小时，完成一万五千顶军帽。
    【本报冀鲁豫四日电】清丰二区后神当头村妇女，为了支援前线，打垮蒋介石的进攻，组织了八个小组给被服厂缝制棉衣，他们说：“咱们一不能当兵，二不能到前方抬担架、送子弹，现在天冷了，前方战士正需要棉衣，这正是咱报答他们的时候到了。”她们每天有四十个人去做活，大家加油赶制，谁也不肯闲一会儿。不到一个月，就完成了一千套棉衣，缝的又好又结实。
