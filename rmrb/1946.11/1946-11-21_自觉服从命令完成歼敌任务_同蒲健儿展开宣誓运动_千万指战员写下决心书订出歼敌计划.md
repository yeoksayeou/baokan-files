　　Consciously Obey Orders to Complete the Task of殲灭 Enemy
    Soldiers of the Tongpu Launch Oath Campaign
    Millions of Commanders and Fighters Write Letters of Determination and Devise Plans to歼灭 the Enemy
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 20th dispatch] On the Tongpu front, in order to continue歼灭 the enemy's active forces of Chiang Kai-shek's army, stop Chiang Kai-shek's offensive, and recover all lost territories, a mass determination to歼灭 the enemy oath campaign was launched in various field army corps. Each regiment, battalion, company, platoon, and squad, even each new and veteran soldier, has formulated his own plan to歼灭 the enemy in the future. Millions of commanders and fighters raised their iron fists and solemnly swore: "In order to defend the interests of the people, stop Chiang Kai-shek's offensive, and recover all lost territories, we are willing to resolutely obey orders, follow commands, and complete all tasks under the wise leadership of the Party. We will not be proud of victory, nor be pessimistic or waver in times of hardship and difficulty, and will try our best to overcome difficulties, abide by the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention, implement policies and laws, cherish the interests of the people, unite closely, study hard, improve our skills and political awareness, and resolutely serve the people to the end." On the 12th of this month, the "49" troops held a determination to殲灭 the enemy oath meeting. Thousands of letters of determination and future plans to殲灭 the enemy written in iron will and blood by the commanders and fighters were displayed in front of the rostrum. At the meeting, Chief Zhao of the "49" troops first reported on the glorious achievements of the past three months. He said: In the past three months, our troops participated in the Wenxia, Hongzhao, and Linfu campaigns, and at the cost of the heroic sacrifice of 51 heroes, a total of 15 infantry companies, 2 artillery companies, and 3 and a half heavy machine gun companies of Chiang Yan's puppet troops were歼灭ed, in exchange for the deaths and injuries of 1,826 soldiers of Chiang Kai-shek's army. He called on all commanders and fighters to "greatly殲灭 the enemy according to everyone's determination and plan." When the representatives spoke, they unanimously requested their superiors to immediately grant them the order to歼灭 Chiang Kai-shek's army. The new soldier representative said, "...We have not fought yet. We are willing to immediately accept orders from our superiors and go to the front line to launch a competition to歼灭 the enemy with the veteran comrades." When cadre representative He Mingde spoke, he first painfully reviewed his past thoughts: "Because I did not understand Chairman Mao's operational policy, I became pessimistic when I saw the encroachment of certain cities and the war turning into a long-term one." He said: "In the future, I am determined to defend the people, to crush the offensive of the traitors, and I am determined to sacrifice everything I have, even my life!" Then, Director He led the oath, and dozens of representatives rushed to the rostrum to sign and stamp. Finally, Director Lei spoke, and he emphatically pointed out: "Your plan cannot be completed by individual strength alone. You must develop new heroism and the collectivism of unity and mutual assistance."

    千万指战员写下决心书订出歼敌计划
    【本报太岳廿日电】同蒲前线各野战兵团，为了继续歼灭进犯蒋军有生力量，停止蒋军进攻，收复一切失地，在各团队中展开了一个群众性的决心歼敌宣誓运动。各团、营、连、排、班以至每个新老战士，都订出了自己今后的歼敌计划，千万指战员举起铁一般的拳头，坚决宣誓：“为了保卫人民利益，停止蒋军进攻，收复一切失地，我们愿在党的英明领导下，坚决服从命令，听从指挥，完成一切任务。胜利不骄傲，艰苦困难时不悲观，不动摇，想尽一切办法克服困难，遵守三大纪律八项注意，执行政策法令，爱护人民利益，亲密团结，努力学习，提高技术及政治觉悟，坚决为人民服务到底”。本月十二日“四九”部队召开歼敌宣誓大会，以铁的意志和鲜血写成的千万份指战员的决心书与今后歼敌计划，陈列在主席台前。开会时，“四九”部队赵首长首先报告了三个月来光辉战绩，他说：本部队七、八、九三个月来参加了闻夏、洪赵、临浮三大战役，以五十一个英雄的壮烈牺牲，共歼灭了蒋阎伪军十五个步兵连，二个炮兵连，三个半重机枪连，换得了蒋军一千八百二十六名的死伤。他号召全体指战员“根据大家的决心和计划，大量歼灭敌人”。各代表讲话时，一致要求上级立即授予他们歼灭蒋军的命令。新战士代表说“……我们还没有打过仗，我们愿意立即接受上级命令，出发前线与老同志展开歼敌竞赛”。干部代表何明德讲话时，先沉痛的检讨过去的思想：“因为不了解毛主席的作战方针，所以看到某些城市的被侵占，战争转入长期，就悲观起来”。他说：“今后我决心为了保卫人民，为了粉碎卖国贼的进攻，决心牺牲自己的一切，以至生命！”接着，何主任领导宣誓，数十名代表蜂拥到主席台上签名盖章。最后，由雷主任讲话，他着重的指出：“你们的计划要想完成，不是个人力量所能及，必须发挥新英雄主义，团结互助的集体主义”。
