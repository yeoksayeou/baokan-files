　　Southern Hebei October Mass Movement
　　Ji'nan Branch
　　After three months of the anti-traitor liquidation movement, the large-scale mobilization phase in most counties of the Southern Hebei New District has ended. For example, in Yongzhi, more than 320 out of 360 villages have been mobilized, with 90% of households involved in the struggle and over 70,000 organized peasants. In the Xiaen sand area, more than 350 villages have been mobilized. All 110 villages in Ningnan have been mobilized. All 16,804 poor peasant households and 1,706 extremely poor households in the county have been eliminated. Only a few counties, such as Jingxian and Fudong, began mobilization in October, and many villages have already undergone large-scale mobilization. It is estimated that over 4,000 villages in the 25 counties of the New District have preliminarily completed land reform, with 2.5 million peasants involved in the struggle to turn the tables. The feudal fortresses of traitors, local bullies, and landlords have been smashed by the peasants, and the peasants in the New District have begun their new lives as masters of their own destiny.

　　According to recent reports, a few counties have entered the consolidation phase. The Yongzhi County Party Committee has issued four instructions, proposing to conduct thorough inspections after the large-scale mobilization to expose the conspiracies of landlords to disperse land and evade struggle, to ensure that the majority of the fruits are distributed to poor and extremely poor peasants, and to correct phenomena such as village cadres and activists receiving too much, or fruits being solely distributed as money, and the failure to adopt supplementary methods in the distribution by groups. At the same time, it is pointed out that it is necessary to combine inspection with organizational rectification, conduct education, and vigorously promote democratic systems and democratic work styles among village cadres and the masses. Ningnan convened a meeting of key county and district cadres after the large-scale mobilization to discuss how to carry out political education, organize the majority of peasants, strengthen women's work, and cultivate mass leaders. In the villages of the Xiaen sand area, "thinking sessions" are generally held to discuss where the fruits came from, how to protect the land, and to compare the three worlds (when the enemy was present, the Kuomintang-controlled area, and the liberated area). The Third District of Handan has already begun a comprehensive review of the turn-over. There is no doubt that consolidation work is more difficult than organizing large-scale mobilization. In the future, we should wholeheartedly and carefully lead the masses to raise the movement to a higher level and lay the foundation for next year's large-scale production movement.

　　The land problem of the peasants in the New District has been largely solved in just three months. The main reasons are, first, that the Party, government, army, and people fully support the mass movement, actively support the masses, and universally further realize bold leadership, starting from the urgent needs of the masses, and that the thinking and work style of fearing that the masses will be "leftist" or "chaotic" and being restrained have been corrected. For example, the turn-over team in the Xiaen sand area proposed "not being afraid of making mistakes," and the cadres broke their concerns and dared to boldly hand over the policies to the masses, and could only "add fuel to the fire without pouring water." If the cadres can be bold and let go, the activists and the masses will also break their concerns and gain courage. At the same time, they completely broke the circle of narrow experience in leadership, and the masses were willing to do whatever they wanted to do, and they were willing to do it together. For example, before Gao Tang launched the anti-Pang (Changjia) movement, Haozhuang first reformed the village government according to the demands of the masses. Guo Zhuang, Ge Tun, and Meng Zhuang first implemented increased wages and reduced rents according to the demands of the masses. In the Xiaen sand area, the Mou Wangzhuang first struggled against the director of the peasant association (a lackey of the landlord) before opening up the large-scale mobilization situation. In many villages, the landlords mostly colluded with the enemy, puppets, and diehards, and the masses had a lot of resentment against them. Once they started, they had to settle all accounts in one go, "cook in one pot," and clear up the historical debts at once. Facts have proved that this is the urgent need of the masses and the best way. Second, it also lies in the good grasp and implementation of the Party Central Committee's land policy. Yongzhi has created three experiences in this regard: First, the emphasis on policies should be different in different stages of the mass movement. Before the masses are mobilized, they should resolutely support the demands of the masses and not emphasize taking care of this or that (taking care of middle peasants must be emphasized), otherwise it will put "golden hoops" on the cadres and draw circles, and they will not dare to boldly mobilize the masses; once the masses have initially taken action and experienced the greatness of their own strength, and dare to take action, they should promptly guide the masses to master the policies. Second, what policies should be put forward when the mass movement reaches what level. For example, putting forward the Central Land Policy at one time would not only be unacceptable to the masses, but also difficult for district and village cadres to accept. Therefore, at the beginning of the movement, it was proposed that all peasants carry out anti-traitor liquidation against traitors and local bullies. After the movement developed, it was proposed to completely eliminate feudal exploitation, realize "land to the tiller," and resolutely not struggle against middle peasants. In the later stage of the mass movement, it was proposed to further sweep away the landlords who had escaped the net. Third, grasp the two main links of the land policy, one is to eliminate feudal exploitation and realize "land to the tiller," and the other is to realize the consolidation of unity between middle and poor peasants in mobilizing the masses, creating an advantage for the rural revolutionary forces.

　　The land investigation, rent reduction, and filling-in-the-gaps movement in the old areas has been widely carried out. Yuanchao has reached the stage of distributing the fruits and reorganizing the organization. Jize, Daming, Qinghe, Guantao, Renxian, Longping, and Yaoshan are all carrying out the movement universally. Before the movement, a survey was conducted on the past mass movements. It was generally believed that some landlords in the old areas adopted hidden methods, and some used tricks such as false sales, "gifts," and "debt repayment" to disperse their land; some bought over and bribed village cadres and peasant leaders in order to seek restoration. The leading county of Jize, in the first-class village of Beifengzheng, clarified from the research that some landlords had escaped the net and the masses had not completely turned over. According to a survey of 101 villages in Guantao, 141 out of 218 landlord households still maintained economic and political advantages, and continued to buy over village cadres and carry out sabotage, rumors, and assassinations against the masses. These facts proved that the ideas of "complacency" and "no more problems" were completely unfounded. Yuanchao has already proposed to conduct a major inspection to ensure that the land is distributed to landless or land-poor peasants, and to completely fill in the gaps. In the villages that have already been filled in, it is necessary to quickly reorganize the organization, carry out patriotic self-defense education, establish a democratic work style within the masses, organize mutual assistance, and shift to production.

　　冀南十月群运
    冀南分社
    冀南新区经过三个月的反奸清算运动，大部县份的大动阶段已经结束。如永智三百六十余村已有三百二十余村发动起来，有百分之九十的户数卷入斗争，有组织的农民达七万余人。夏恩沙区已有三百五十余村发动起来。宁南一百一十村全部发动，全县一万六千八百零四户贫农，一千七百零六户赤贫，已全部消灭，仅个别县份如景县、阜东于十月份开始发动，现不少村庄亦已大动过去。计在二十五县的新区有四千余村初步完成土地改革，二百五十万农民卷入翻身斗争、汉奸、恶霸、地主的封建堡垒已被农民打垮，新区农民以主人翁的地位开始其新生活。
    据最近报导，已有少数县份进入巩固阶段。永智县委机关已发出四次指示，提出在大动后要很好进行检查，揭穿地主疏散土地，逃避斗争的阴谋，掌握大部果实分到贫农和赤贫手里，纠正村干、积极分子所得太多，或果实单纯要钱，以及按组分配而未采取补齐办法等现象。同时指出要结合检查整理组织，进行教育，在村干与群众之间，大力宣传民主制度和民主作风。宁南于大动后召开了县区主要干部会，讨论如何开展政治教育，组织农民大多数，加强妇女工作，培养群众领袖。夏恩沙区各村，普遍召开“想想会”，讨论果实是从那里来的，土地如何保护，比较三个世界（敌人在时、国民党统治区、解放区）。邯郸三区已经开始翻身大检查。毫无疑问，巩固工作较之组织大动更为繁难，今后应当全心全意细心努力的领导群众，将运动提高一步，打下明年大生产运动的基础。
    在短短三个月内，新区农民土地问题，大部解决，其主要原因，首先在于党政军民全力支持群运，积极为群众撑腰，普遍的进一步实现大胆放手的领导，一切从群众的迫切需要出发，怕群众“左”，怕“乱”，束手束脚的思想和作风，得到纠正。如夏恩沙区翻身队提出“不怕犯错误”，干部打破了顾虑，大了胆，才敢放手把政策交给群众，才能只“烧火不泼水”。干部能够大胆放手，积极分子和群众也就打破顾虑，壮大了胆量。同时完全打破了领导上狭隘经验的圈子，群众愿意搞啥就搞啥，愿意一齐搞就一齐搞。如高唐开展反庞（长甲）运动前，郝庄先根据群众要求，改造了村政权，郭庄、葛屯、孟庄先根据群众要求实行了增资减租，夏恩沙区牟王庄先斗争了农会主任（地主的腿子）才轰开了大动局面。又如许多村庄，地主多数勾结敌伪顽，群众和他积怨甚多，一搞就要算总账，“一锅煮”，历史上的欠债一次讨清，事实证明这是群众迫切需要，也是最好的方式。其次，还在于很好的掌握与贯彻了党中央土地政策。永智在这方面创造了三点经验：第一，群众运动不同阶段，对政策的强调应有所不同，群众未行动起来以前，应坚决支持群众要求，不强调照顾这、照顾那（照顾中农则须强调），否则会给干部套上“金箍”，划上圈子，不敢放手发动群众；一旦群众已经初步行动起来，体验到自己力量的伟大，敢于行动时，则应及时引导群众掌握政策。第二，群众运动到什么火候，就提出什么政策。如把中央土地政策一次提出，不仅群众接受不了，区村干部也难以接受。所以运动发动之初，则提出全体农民对汉奸恶霸反奸清算，运动发展之后，则提出彻底消灭封建剥削，实现“耕者有其田”，坚决不斗中农；到群运后期，则提出进一步扫清漏网地主。第三，掌握土地政策的两个主要环节，一个是消灭封建剥削，实现“耕者有其田”，一个是在发动群众中，实现中贫农的巩固团结，造成农村革命力量的优势。
    老区的查减，填平补齐运动已经普遍开展，元朝已至分配果实，整理组织阶段，鸡泽、大名、清河、馆陶、任县、隆平、尧山都在普遍开展。运动前，对过去群运作了调查，一致认为在老区有些地主采取了隐蔽办法，有的以假当假卖“赠送”“挡账”等诡计疏散其土地；有的对村干、农民领袖收买利诱，以谋复辟。先进县份鸡泽第一等村庄北风正村干，从研究中明确了还有些地主漏了网，群众没有翻透身。馆陶据一○一村的调查，二百十八户地主，尚有一百四十一户保持着经济上和政治上的优势，并不断收买村干和对群众进行破坏造谣、暗杀等勾当。这些事实证明了“自满”和“没有问题了”的思想完全没有根据。元朝已经提出进行大检查，保证把土地分到无地或少地的贫民手里，彻底作到填平补齐，在已经填平补齐的村庄，要迅速整理组织，进行爱国自卫教育，树立群众内部的民主作风，组织互助，转入生产。
