Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, November 9th: According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing on the 8th, representatives of the Third Parties held a press conference at the Bank of Communications at 9:30 PM on the 8th. Shen Junru, Luo Longji, and Zhang Shenfu presided over the conference, and Luo, on behalf of the Third Parties, read the following written thoughts regarding Chiang Kai-shek's statement on the 8th: "According to general opinion, there is not enough time to study all the contents of the statement in detail. The ceasefire meets the expectations of the people nationwide. However, it is felt that all the measures mentioned in the statement differ greatly from the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) and its procedures. In particular, according to the PCC resolutions, the sole function of the current National Assembly is to draft the constitution, and its nature is sacred and solemn. The statement regarding the National Assembly and the draft constitution raises concerns: (1) Constitution-making is a century-long undertaking. The act of retaining seats for national representatives is not only unprecedented in the history of constitution-making worldwide, but also undermines the dignity of the constitutional convention. (2) The draft constitution comes from constitutional deliberation. Now that the agreement on the draft constitution has not been completed, it is handed over to the National Assembly for decision, which will inevitably lead to endless future disputes. (3) The amendment of the constitution should be stipulated in the constitution itself. Now that the law has not yet been established, a provision is made for amending it in six months. How can such an unstable fundamental law gain the trust of the people nationwide?"

    第三方面发表书面感想
    蒋介石声明令人疑虑
    宪法尚未拟定即预言半年后修改
    制宪保留国大代表名额史无前例
    【新华社延安九日电】据中央社南京八日电：第三方面人士八日晚九时半，在交通银行举行记者招待会，由沈钧儒、罗隆基、张申府主持，罗氏代表第三方面，就蒋介石八日发表之声明宣读如下之书面感想：“据一般意见，咸以时间不足，尚未能就文告全部详细研究。停战一事已符全国人民之期望，惟感触所及，认为声明中所提之一切办法与政协决议及其程序出入甚多，尤以根据政协决议，本届国大惟一职权，为制定宪法，其性质实为神圣庄严，此次文告关于国大与宪草一节，甚有令人发生疑虑之感：（一）制宪既为百年大业，国民代表有保留名额之举，不只开世界制宪史上未有之先例，且有损制宪会议之尊严。（二）宪草由宪议而来，现宪草协议既未完成，遂交国大决定，必贻未来无限纠纷。（三）宪法修改应在宪法内规定修改手续，今法尚未定，即预留六个月后即行修改之余地，此种摇摇不定之根本大法，如何能坚全国人民之信守。”
