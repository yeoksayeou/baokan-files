Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th. Comprehensive Report: Since gaining open and legal status a year ago, the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) has seen rapid development in its struggle to unite the Japanese people to build a democratic Japan. At the JCP's Fifth Plenary Congress held from February 24th to 26th this year, Chairman Yoshio Shiga declared: "In December of last year, the JCP had only 1,200 members, but at the time of the meeting, it had already increased to 6,800." According to the Tokyo "Jiji News" on February 1st, many Japanese soldiers, after being repatriated, joined the JCP. According to the February issue of "Amerasia" magazine, after the right-wing-dominated Central Executive Committee of the Socialist Party refused to cooperate with the JCP in establishing a democratic front and declared that it would preserve the Emperor system, "to realize democracy and socialism under a democratized Emperor system," many lower-level Socialist Party members, dissatisfied with this policy, left the party and joined the JCP. By the end of May, JCP membership had reached 20,000. According to JCP Central Committee member Kenji Miyamoto, when he met with reporters, "In half a year, it has increased more than eighteenfold. In the general election on April 10th, the JCP received a total of two million votes, although the JCP currently has only six Diet members. (Known members are Kyuichi Tokuda, Yoshio Shiga, Tetsu Nosaka, Izhino Nakanishi, Shuko Karasawa (female), and the Hokkaido coal mine workers' leader.) Its total number of votes is 1.5 million more than the Cooperative Party, which won fourteen seats. (The Socialist Party, which won ninety-four seats, received a total of nine million votes.) Currently, Japanese trade union members under the leadership of the JCP number approximately 1.5 to 2 million, while those under the leadership of the Socialist Party number approximately 1 to 1.5 million."

    半年来在民主斗争中
    日共党员激增十八倍
    领导工会会员二百万
    【新华社延安十五日电】综合报导：日共自获得公开合法的地位一年以来，在团结日本人民为建设民主的日本的斗争中，已有急剧的发展。在今年二月二十四日至二十六日召开的日共五全大会上，主席志贺义雄宣称：“去年十二月时日共党员仅有一千二百名，而开会当时则已增至六千八百名。”据东京《时事新闻》二月一日所载：许多日军士兵遣送回国后，即加入了日共。又据《美亚》杂志二月号所载：当右派统治的社会党中央执行委员会拒绝与日共合作建立民主阵线，并声明保存天皇制“在民主化的天皇制之下，实现民主主义与社会主义。”以后很多社会党下层群众因不满该党此种政策，纷纷脱党，参加日共。至五月末日共党员已达两万人。据日共中委宫本显制招待记者时称：“半年以内增加了十八倍以上，在四月十日的大选中，日共所得总票数为二百万票，虽然日共现在祗有议员六名。（已知者有德田球一、志贺义雄、野坂铁、中西伊之唐泽淑子（女）、北海道煤矿工人领袖。）其总数与当选十四席之协同党相较还多一百五十万票。（当选九十四席之社会党，共得九百万票。）目前在日共领导之下的日本工会会员约有一百五十万至二百万人，而在社会党领导下的约有一百万至一百五十万人。
