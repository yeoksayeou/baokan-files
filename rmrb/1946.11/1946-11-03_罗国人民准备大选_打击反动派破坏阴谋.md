Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 31st: Bucharest dispatch: Throughout Romania, grand mass rallies are being held on the eve of the election (November 19th is the general election day). According to Romanian Prime Minister Groza, seven million Romanian men and women have registered on the electoral roll (the last election only had two million and tens of thousands). In Croz, more than 120,000 workers, peasants, and intellectuals participated in the rally. Prime Minister Groza and others delivered speeches at the meeting, which were warmly welcomed by the audience. In Sighișoara, 20,000 Romanian and Hungarian peasants held a rally, expressing their support for the Democratic Parties Alliance. The Democratic League's youth election meeting has also been held, with speakers calling for a victory of democratic forces in the election. At the same time, the reactionaries are also stepping up their activities. The Romanian police have searched and found a large number of weapons, ammunition, fascist propaganda materials and secret orders to organize "shock troops" buried by members of the National Liberal Party and the National Peasant Party. The United States even sent a note to the Romanian government on the 28th, interfering in Romania's internal affairs, demanding that the opposition be given full "freedom." Britain also issued a similar note on the 27th.
　　
Furthermore, Groza firmly opposed Maniu's (National Peasant Party) request for the Control Commission to supervise the election, as well as the National Liberal Party and the National Peasant Party's request for a postponement of the election, and stated that "the election will proceed as scheduled." Groza pointed out that after the failure of the opposition's conspiracy, they may use the last resort, that is, refuse to participate in the election, but the election result will undoubtedly be the victory of the Democratic Front.

　　罗国人民准备大选
    打击反动派破坏阴谋
    【新华社延安三十一日电】布加勒斯特讯：罗马尼亚全国各地都在举行选举前夜（十一月十九日为大选日）的盛大群众大会，据罗总理格罗查称：七百万罗国男女已登记在选民册上（上次选举仅有二百数十万）。在克罗兹，即有工农知识分子十二万余人参加大会。格罗查总理等在会上发表演说，备受听众之热烈欢迎。在西基索亚，罗匈农民二万人举行大会，表示对民主党派联盟的拥护。民主联盟的青年选举大会亦已举行，演讲者呼吁在选举中争取民主势力的胜利。与此同时，反动派亦加紧其活动。罗警察已搜查到国家自由党及国家农民党党员所埋藏的大量武器军火与法西斯宣传品及组织“突击队”的密令。美国竟于二十八日致罗政府一照会，干涉罗国内政，要求予反对派充分“自由”，英国亦于二十七日发出同样照会。
    又讯：格罗查对马尼乌（国家农民党）要求管制委员会来监督选举以及国家自由党及国家农民党要求选举延期一事坚决表示反对，并称“选举将如期进行”。格氏指出反对派的阴谋失败之后，可能使用最后一着，即拒绝参加选举，但是选举结果无疑的将是民主阵线获胜。
