Starting from the Interests of the Broad Masses
The Experience of Carrying Out Mass Guerrilla Warfare in Yuanqu

The development of mass guerrilla warfare in Yuanqu has the following experiences:

(1) Starting from the interests of the broad masses, and combining with the masses' struggle against traitorous bullies to "reverse settlements." After the Chiang Kai-shek troops occupied Yuanqu, they instigated a few traitors, bullies, and secret agents to organize "revenge teams," oppress and "reverse settlements," and cruelly slaughter liberated peasants. For example, Li Chengrong, the chairman of the original Tupi Township Farmers' Association, and his entire family of nine were all murdered. According to incomplete statistics, more than sixty compatriots were sacrificed throughout the county. The traitorous bullies also set up a large oil pot in Gaoluo Town to threaten the liberated peasants, causing much apprehension among the masses. This apprehension became a major obstacle to carrying out guerrilla warfare. Initially, when the idea of "opposing the reversal of settlements" was proposed, the masses were still hesitant. An activist in a certain village stated, "A strong dragon cannot suppress a local snake," explaining that although the Chiang Kai-shek troops' secret agents were ruthless, they did not have as many people as we did, nor were they as familiar with the area as we were. We can advance and retreat anywhere; what are we afraid of? This gradually dispelled everyone's apprehension. Under the leadership of activists, the villages carried forward the heroic spirit of this spring's "anti-sixty jin" movement, capturing and suppressing the worst traitorous bullies and secret agents everywhere. Under the cover of the militia, the masses in the Second District broke into the Gaoluo stronghold and killed the secret agent Cao Laosan (near Huai), who had set up the oil pot to threaten the masses, in a house only twenty steps away from the pillbox. They captured more than ten "reverse settlement" elements and returned the "reversed" items to the masses, greatly boosting the masses' fighting spirit. Even many who were targeted for struggle said, "I don't think Chiang Kai-shek's rule will last long," and dared not act rashly. The Yuanqu masses were very good at distinguishing between the seriousness of the crimes committed by traitorous bullies and landlords: they resolutely suppressed those like Cao Laosan, who had committed all kinds of evil; and for those who were hesitant or had gone astray, they explained the greater good and tried their best to win them back. For example, the village head of Lianhui Village defected to the enemy. When we raided Gaoluo and killed Cao Laosan, we sent someone back to make contact with him. The masses allowed him to repent and start anew. He secretly ran back, admitted his mistake, and the masses did not hold his past actions against him. In this way, the worst traitorous bullies were isolated, and the majority were won over. With the masses' apprehensions dispelled, guerrilla warfare spread like wildfire on a broad foundation and could not be stopped.

(2) Clarify the concept that "the militia is an armed force to protect the home," and it is not appropriate to overemphasize centralized use. Initially, the Second District established a militia field company with a large area of activity. The militia harbored the idea of working for their own villages. Later, the field company was divided into three groups, with the militia from each area returning to that area to serve as the backbone of the local guard militia. This not only dispelled the militia's concern for their hometowns but also strengthened the connection between the militia and the masses. Of course, sometimes, it is also necessary to temporarily concentrate the militia to complete a specific task.

(3) Cadres taking the lead personally is the decisive factor in launching guerrilla warfare. Especially in areas that have been ruled by the enemy for a long time, the masses have rich experience in opposing "puppet regimes" but lack training in armed struggle. In severe environments, the personal leadership of the main cadres is of decisive significance. The reason why the guerrilla warfare in the × District is particularly active is inseparable from the exemplary actions of the instructor of the district command, Zhao Yuanxi, and others. They often personally lead the militia to operate around the strongholds of the stubborn and puppet forces. Instead of criticizing and accusing some village cadres who lack experience and are "less courageous," they actively fight alongside them. For example, Wang Jisheng, a cadre in Gaoluo Village, was timid at first. Comrade Zhao Yuanxi let him work with the field company. Once, they were hit by eighteen shells from the Chiang Kai-shek troops on the mountain, but no one was injured, which made him realize that American weapons were nothing more than that. Then, he took him to attack Gaoluo Town, using hand grenades to repel the Chiang Kai-shek troops who were pouncing on them, which further increased his confidence. Now, Wang Jisheng has become a very good director of the armed committee, often leading the militia to strike the enemy near Gaoluo independently.

　　从广大群众利益出发
    垣曲开展群众游击战的经验
    垣曲群众游击战争的开展有如下几点经验：
    （一）从广大群众利益出发，与群众反对奸霸“倒算账”的斗争相结合。蒋军侵占垣曲后即唆使少数汉奸、恶霸、特务组织“复仇队”，压迫“倒算账”，残酷屠杀翻身农民，如原土坪农会主席李成荣全家九口悉遭毒手。据不完全统计，全县牺牲的同胞达六十余人。奸霸并在皋落镇支起一口大油锅来威胁翻身农民，给群众很多顾虑。这种顾虑便成为开展游击战争的很大障碍。起初提出“反倒算”时，群众还有些犹豫，某村积极分子提出：“强龙不压地头蛇”，说明蒋军特务虽狠，但他没有我们人多，没有我们熟悉。我们到处可进可退，怕他们啥？逐渐打破了大家的顾虑。各村在积极分子领导下，发扬了今春反“六十斤”运动的英勇精神，到处抓捕镇压“倒算账”最坏的奸霸特务。二区群众在民兵掩护下，突入皋落据点，在离碉堡二十几步的房内打死支油锅威胁群众的特务曹老三（近怀）等，抓回“倒算账”分子十余人，把“倒算”出来的东西原封还给群众，大大鼓舞了群众斗争情绪，连许多斗争对象都说：“我看中央军的天下长不了”，不敢轻举妄动。垣曲群众对待奸霸地主是最会分别轻重的：他们对于像曹老三那样无恶不作的家伙，予以坚决镇压；对犹豫不定或误入歧途的人，则晓以大义，尽量争取他们回头。如连回村村长投敌，当我奔袭皋落打死曹老三时，又派人回来接头，群众让他悔过自新，他即偷跑回来，承认错误，群众也不究既往。这样便孤立了最坏的奸霸，争取了多数。解除了群众的顾虑，游击战争便在广泛的基础上，如火燎原，不可遏止。
    （二）明确“民兵是保家的武装”的观念，不宜过分强调集中使用。二区起初成立了民兵野战连，活动范围较大，民兵中存着怀念本村的工作思想，后来将野战连分成三个集团，那个地区的民兵回到那个地区，作为当地警卫民兵的骨干，这样既可解除民兵中记挂家乡的情绪，又可增强民兵与群众的连系。当然有时候，为完成某一个特定的任务，暂时集中使用民兵，也是必要的。
    （三）干部亲自带头，是展开游击战争的决定因素。尤其是过去长期被敌人统治的地区，群众有丰富的反“维持”经验，却缺乏武装斗争的锻炼，环境严重的，主要干部的亲自带头，具有决定意义。×区游击战争之所以特别活跃，是与该区指挥部教导员赵元玺等的模范行动分不开的，他们经常亲自带领民兵活跃于顽伪据点的周围，对某些缺乏经验“胆子较小”的村干部，不是批评指责，而是积极的同他们一块战斗。如皋落村干部王继升开头胆怯，赵元玺同志便让他跟野战连一起活动，一次在山上被蒋军打了十八炮，没伤一个人，使他认识了美国武器也不过如此；接着又带他去袭击皋落镇，用手榴弹把向他们猛扑的蒋军打退，他信心更加提高了。现在王继升已经成为很好的武委会主任，经常领导民兵单独在皋落附近打击敌人。
