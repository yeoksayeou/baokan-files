　　The Righteousness of the People
    Wenxi Militia Resolutely Refuse to Yield, Ingeniously Escape After Capture, and Return with Weapons; Youths Captured in Taigu Also Return with Arms
    [Our dispatch] Last month, the squad leader of the Yan Army's "Revenge Squad" in Taigu, Ji Jingui, and over ten young soldiers including Ji Wa, were forcibly conscripted by the Yan regime to serve as cannon fodder. Unwilling to kill their own compatriots, they resolutely returned to the Liberated Area with their weapons and embraced the people. They brought with them one light machine gun, two Japanese-made Type 38 rifles, four Type 79 rifles, 1,800 rounds of ammunition, fourteen hand grenades, and six bayonets. Upon their arrival in the Liberated Area, they were warmly welcomed by the masses. The county headquarters commended Ji and others for their ability to distinguish right from wrong and their courage and resourcefulness, allocating 6,000 yuan to express their appreciation and calling on youths captured by the enemy to return to the Liberated Area with their weapons. (Ming Jian)
    [Taiyue Dispatch, 24th] In September, when the enemy launched a large-scale invasion of the Wenxia area, twenty-three Wenxi militiamen who had been captured by the Chiang army have successively escaped and returned. On September 20th, when militiamen from Weimin Village, led by squad leader Comrade Li Dejiang, attacked the Chiang army's 43rd Brigade during its "mopping-up" operation, Comrade Li Dejiang led the team in a charge and heroically sacrificed his life. After Li Zhixin and several others were captured, the Chiang army incorporated them into the Xia County "Love the Village Corps." On October 12th, Li Zhixin, Li Jiatu, Li Baolin, Li Qingyuan, and others each took a rifle and escaped back. They formed a militia combat group of over ten people and continued to strike at the Chiang army, "avenging Comrade Li Dejiang." Wang Anjia and Yang Degui, militiamen from ×× Village, along with five others, were captured by the Chiang army's Second Detachment on September 23rd. Subjected to threats and inducements, the militiamen remained unyielding until death. Finally, on October 14th, they escaped and brought back four rifles and over 2,000 rounds of ammunition. In addition, one militiaman from ×× Village, four militiamen from × Village, and five militiamen from × Village also successively escaped with their weapons. "The spirit of the above militiamen, who are loyal, determined, and resourceful in escaping danger, is commendable." The Taiyue Military Region and the Military Affairs Committee General Association have specially commended them and called on captured militiamen in various regions to learn from them.
