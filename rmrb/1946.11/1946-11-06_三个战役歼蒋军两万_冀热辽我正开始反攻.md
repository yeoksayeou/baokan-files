Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd: In the past week, judging only from the three campaigns in Jiangsu-Anhui, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, and the northern section of the Peiping-Hankow Railway, the People's Army has annihilated 20,000 invading Chiang troops. General Liu Bocheng's troops achieved a major victory in the west of Shandong province, south of Juancheng, last week. The main forces of Chiang's army, the 68th Division and part of the 55th Division, entered the ambush area pre-arranged by the Eighth Route Army on the 29th, and were immediately annihilated. All 8,000 Chiang troops were wiped out. In the past three months or more, the People's Army has annihilated more than 200,000 enemies in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area and on the front lines of the Longhai and Tongpu Railways. In northern Jiangsu, more than 7,000 Chiang troops were annihilated in the suburbs of Lianshui. The New Fourth Army pursued the victory, and on the 30th and 31st, another 1,000 troops of the 192nd Brigade of the 28th Division of the Chiang army were annihilated, and the towns of Qinggong and Jiaoling in the southwest and southeast of Lianshui were recovered, threatening the rear of Huai'an and Huaiyin. Up to now, 85,000 Chiang troops have been annihilated in the Jiangsu-Anhui battlefield in the past three months. In mid-October, in the Central Jiangsu area, after the recovery of more than ten strongholds such as Jiali and Libao, except for a few empty towns still occupied by Chiang's troops, the rest are all under the control of the New Fourth Army.

The two regiments of the main force of Chiang's army, the 77th Division (originally a military reorganization), which invaded Linyi from Zaozhuang and Yixian in southern Shandong, were severely damaged in the Lanling area and retreated to their original location in Yixian. The Eighth Route Army recovered the important stronghold of Lanling Town on the Linyi-Yixian Highway on the 31st. The 26th Division of Chiang's army, which invaded Shuiguoji from Zaozhuang in the east, also collapsed on the 31st.

The military and civilians of eastern Hebei recovered more than ten strongholds, including Cuihuangkou, an important town east of Wuqing, and Dalian Town. Strongholds such as Xiawudi east of Xianghe and Baiyan east of Miyun, and many strongholds in the Lulong-Luanxian area have been cleared. Qian'an has been surrounded. In the Jehol-Liaoning area, not only is guerrilla warfare in full swing, but our regular army has also begun a counter-offensive.
