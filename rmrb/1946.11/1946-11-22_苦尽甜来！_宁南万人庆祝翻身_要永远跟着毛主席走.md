　　After Hardship Comes Happiness!
　　Ten Thousand People in Ningnan Celebrate Their Emancipation
　　Vowing to Always Follow Chairman Mao
　　[Our newspaper's Weixian, 18th dispatch] After realizing land reform, Ningnan held a celebration of emancipation and honoring model (emancipation heroes) ten thousand-person meeting on the 4th of this month in Dongwangdong Town. The emancipated peasant women dressed up in over a hundred kinds of entertainment, with novel patterns, filling the vast venue with the peasants' carnival. Two large flags of "Peasant Emancipation" and "Always Follow Chairman Mao" fluttered in the air. An old woman who had just entered the venue said, "Hearing about the meeting, all four of us from my family came! Only Chairman Mao on the ancestral altar is left!" A child led a blind person, singing and dancing to the tune of "Chiang Kai-shek is bound to be finished," entering the venue, causing laughter throughout the audience. An old man said happily, "If you want to talk about fighting old Chiang, this old man has to fight him too!" When the grand meeting began, amidst thunderous applause, the elected models took the stage to speak. They unanimously and sincerely requested everyone to offer more opinions and criticisms, and firmly expressed that they must listen to everyone and work for the masses. Ten thousand people below the stage shouted, "Resolutely follow the models." The meeting was lively all day, and in the evening, female peasant members from Dongzhen performed plays such as "After Hardship Comes Happiness," "Old Chiang Sells Out the Country," "Support the Army and Join the Army," and "Oppose Arranged Marriages" to add to the excitement.
