Nanguantao High School Teachers and Students Voluntarily Care for the Wounded and Sick
[This newspaper, Weixian, 25th] In order to allow the wounded and sick to have a quiet recuperation, the First Field Hospital of Southern Hebei moved from Fan County. When passing through Nanguantao, due to the increase in the number of patients and the small number of staff, they were unable to take care of everyone. The students of Nanguantao High School, under the leadership of Principal Hao Huamin and teachers Li Rugong and Jin Luwei, voluntarily came to care for the wounded and sick. The hospital conducted education on nursing work, and they were divided into groups to care for them in each ward. The students were very enthusiastic and never left the wards. The 52 students not only bought 50 boxes of cigarettes with the money they earned from their own production and gave them to the wounded and sick, but also often read newspapers, read letters of condolence, and explained hospital rules to the wounded and sick, and sang in the wards. Students Yang Guirong and Zhang Yuqing, in addition to taking care of the patients, also helped them wash clothes and quilts. Liu Guochen and Liu Haixiu insisted on working despite being ill. Shi Yumei helped the wounded and sick write three letters. Zhang Yanxian, Zhang Huairen, and Shi Xinhe took good care of the patients, moving them to say, "Comrade, don't tire yourself out!" Wang Shutian took care of the patients and didn't even return for meals. Guo Yan often gave the patients current affairs explanations. All the staff of the hospital held boundless admiration and gratitude for the spirit of the teachers and students of Guantao in caring for the wounded and sick.

    【本报威县廿五日电】冀南第一野战医院一所，为了使伤病员得到安静的休养，从范县转移，路经南馆陶时，因病员增多，工作人员很少，照顾不过来，南馆陶高小学生在校长郝化民、教员李汝功靳鲁卫三同志领导下，自动来照护伤病员，院方进行了护理工作的教育，即分组到各病房照护。学生们的情绪很高，没有脱离过病房，五十二名学生，不但将亲手生产的钱买了五十盒纸烟送给伤病员，并经常给伤病员读报、读慰问信、讲院规，在病房唱歌。杨贵荣、张玉清二同学除了照护彩号外，还帮助彩号洗衣服、洗被子，刘国臣、刘海秀身体有病，始终坚持工作，石玉梅帮助伤病员写了三封信，张延贤、张怀仁、石新和照护工作很好，感动的彩号说：“同志，你不要累着了！”王书田照护病号，吃饭时还不回来，郭延对彩号经常进行时事讲解。医院全体工作人员对馆陶师生爱护伤病员的精神，抱有无限的钦佩与感谢。
