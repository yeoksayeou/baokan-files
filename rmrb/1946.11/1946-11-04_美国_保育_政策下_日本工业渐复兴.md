Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st. Economist Mr. Meng Xianzhang, in an opinion piece published in the Beiping World Daily on October 17th, "Seeing the Threat of Japan to Me from the Post-War Industrial Revival," pointed out that after China is dominated by American economic forces, there is a crisis of being dominated by Japanese economic forces supported by the United States. Currently, under the U.S. policy of so-called control, but in reality, sheltering and conserving Japan, its industry is reviving day by day. The Japanese government has specifically designated the development of 48 kinds of light industry. Among them, the textile industry has gained sufficient opportunities to resume work because the United States has agreed to ship in 870,000 bales of cotton this year. By the end of this year, spindles can be restored to 3.28 million (only 2.78 million when it just surrendered), which is about the sum of China's "state-owned" and private spindles (about 4 million). Moreover, the number of those actually operating in our country is not as many as in Japan. Therefore, in the near future, a large number of Japanese cotton fabrics will surely be dumped in China again. In the past year, the production of Japan's main goods has increased by 330%, and general consumer goods have increased by 660%. The total export value for the first four months of this year has exceeded 100 million U.S. dollars, and it is estimated that it may reach 400 million U.S. dollars in the latter six months. In terms of heavy industry, although the munitions industry has been abolished, MacArthur still allows it to produce 2.7 million tons of steel annually, and the retained hydro and thermal power generation reaches 5.1 million kilowatts. (China's total is less than one million kilowatts.) 27,000 machine tools (China's total is 200 units). Mr. Meng also quoted a statistic from Mr. Rola Bonner of the U.S. Reparations Committee, saying: "According to Rola's statistics, Japan's current steel production still accounts for 81% of the total output of Asian countries, steel bars account for 75%, pig iron accounts for 45%, aluminum accounts for 63%, acid accounts for 75%, chlorine accounts for 90%, machine tools account for 85%, transportation equipment accounts for 65%, and electricity accounts for 56%." Mr. Meng concluded by calling on the people of the whole country to unanimously oppose the U.S. policy of supporting Japan's revival, as the old situation of "industrial Japan, agricultural China" will be restored within ten years.

    美国“保育”政策下
    日本工业渐复兴
    【新华社延安一日电】经济学家孟宪章氏，在十月十七日北平世界日报上，发表舆论“从战后工业复兴看到日本对我的威胁”指出中国受美国经济势力支配之后，有再受美国扶植下的日本经济势力支配之危机。目前日本在美国名为管制，实则托庇保育的政策下，工业正日趋复兴，日政府特指定发展四十八种轻工业，其中纺织业一项，因美国允于今年内，运入棉花八十七万包，而得到了充分复工的机会。到今年年底，纺锤可恢复到三百二十八万枚（刚刚投降时，仅为二百七十八万枚），约等于我国“国营”与民营纺锤的总和（约四百万枚）。且我国实际开工者，并不如日本之多。故于不久将来，大批日本棉织品，必又重到中国倾销。在过去一年中，日本主要货物之生产，已增加百分之三百三十，一般消费品，则增加百分之六百六十。今年前四个月的输出总值已超过一万万美元，后六个月预计可能达到四万万美元。在重工业方面，军火工业虽被废弃，但麦克阿瑟还允许他年产钢铁二百七十万吨，所保留的水力、火力发电，达五百一十万千瓦。（中国全国不足百万千瓦）工具机二万七千台（中国全国二百台）。孟氏并引用美国赔偿委员会饶莱柏纳统计称：“据饶莱统计，目前日本钢铁生产仍占亚洲各国总产量之百分之八十一，钢条占百分之七十五，铣铁占百分之四十五，铝百分之六十三、酸百分之七十五，盐素百分之九十，机械工具百分之八十五，运输器机百分之六十五，电力百分之五十六。”孟氏结语号召全国人民，一致反对美国扶植日本复兴的政策，十年以内又会恢复“工业日本，农业中国”的旧局面。
