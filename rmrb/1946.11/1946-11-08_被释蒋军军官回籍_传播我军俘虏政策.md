　　Released Chiang Army Officers Return Home
    Spreading Our Army's Policy on Prisoners of War
    [Our Frontline Reporter Group, 4th dispatch] Du Jinkui, the lieutenant company commander of the Chiang Army's 86th Regiment, clerk Zhang Qi of the 9th company, and a group of soldiers laid down their arms in Liujiazhuang. When our cadres explained the Eighth Route Army's policy to them, they all said in unison: "We know the Eighth Route Army's policy on prisoners of war, so we are not afraid. Liu Zhiguo, the company commander of the 4th company of our regiment, was captured by you in August at the Liuhe Railway Station on the Longhai Line. You sent him back to his hometown in Suzhou County, Anhui, and hired three animals, even letting his wife and younger sister ride them. We all saw him when he passed by Shangqiu. Later, the division commander called him in and forbade him from meeting with everyone. He also gathered everyone and lectured them, saying, "Company Commander Liu was unfortunately captured and escaped midway." But his words were too late. During the meeting, Company Commander Liu had already told us about how the Eighth Route Army treats officers and soldiers who lay down their arms."
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 5th dispatch] According to Jin Bangsheng, the deputy company commander of the 3rd company of the 11th Brigade of the Independent 10th Division of the Chiang Army, who laid down his arms in the Zouping campaign, "I have never seen artillery fire as accurate as that of the Eighth Route Army. That day, three shots in a row hit the division headquarters' residence." According to a messenger from the division headquarters, "The Eighth Route Army's artillery fire is really accurate. I personally saw seventy or eighty wounded soldiers being carried past the front of the division headquarters, all of whom had been hit in the head at the breach in the city wall." The thirty-odd Chiang soldiers who crawled out of the ruins of the city wall during the Zouping campaign exclaimed in surprise as soon as they laid down their arms: "Your hand grenades are very powerful." According to a captured notification from the 3rd Brigade of the division, it stated: "The Communist army's courage in short-range hand grenade throwing and bayonet fighting is truly rare." It also stated: "The Communist army is well-equipped, with complete light and heavy weapons, and the soldiers are energetic and physically strong." Therefore, the brigade commander, Li Jiawen, lamented in a telegram to each battalion: "Our combat operations are always passive, which is very worrying."
    [Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 4th dispatch] According to Chiang army officers who laid down their arms in the Lianshui battle, the Chiang army and the New Fourth Army each have four customary tactics in combat. The Chiang army's are: (1) No night battles; (2) No hand-to-hand combat during the day; (3) No fighting when there is only one battalion of troops; (4) Fighting to the death when attacking or defending strongholds. The New Fourth Army's are: (1) Extremely fast marching speed; (2) Skilled in night battles; (3) Vigorous in charging; (4) Close cooperation with the people. It is said that the fourth point of the New Fourth Army in particular is unattainable by the Chiang army.

　　被释蒋军军官回籍
    传播我军俘虏政策
    【本报前线记者团四日电】蒋军八六团上尉连长杜金魁，九连文书张其及一群士兵，在刘家庄放下武器，我干部向他们解释八路军政策时，他们都异口同声的说：“我们知道八路军的俘虏政策，所以不害怕。我们团四连连长刘治国，八月在陇海路柳河车站被你们俘虏，你们送他回安徽宿县老家，雇了三匹牲口，连他太太和他妹妹都骑上。他路过商邱，我们都见到了。后来师长把他叫去，不准他和大家见面。并且集合大家训话说：“刘连长不幸被俘，中途逃回。”但是他的话太迟了，刘连长见面时，已经把八路军如何优待放下武器的官兵的事实，都告诉我们了。”
    【新华社山东五日电】据邹平战役中放下武器之蒋军独十师十一旅三连副金邦声称：“我过去从没见过像八路军炮兵那样打的准，那天连发三炮都打中师部驻房。”又据该师部传令兵说：“八路军炮兵真打得准，我亲眼看到从师部门前抬过的七八十个伤兵，都是在城墙缺口处打中脑袋瓜子的。”而邹平战役当时从城墙废墟中爬出来的三十多个蒋军，刚放下武器就惊奇地称：“你们手榴弹爆炸很厉害。”据缴获该师三旅的通报，其中有谓：“共军短距离手榴弹投掷和刺刀战之勇敢，真少见。”又称：“共军装备优良，轻重武器齐全，士兵精神旺盛，体格强壮。”因此该旅长李甲文致各营代电哀鸣道：“我们作战处处陷于被动，殊为可忧。”
    【新华社华中四日电】据涟水战斗中放下武器之蒋军军官谈：蒋军与新四军作战战术，各有四条惯例。蒋军是：（一）夜战不打；（二）白天肉搏不打；（三）只有一个营兵力时，不打；（四）攻守据点时死打。新四军则是：一行军神速；二擅长夜战；三冲锋精神旺盛；四深得人民密切合作。据谓特别是新四军的第四条，为蒋军所无法获取云。
