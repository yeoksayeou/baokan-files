    汲 County and Jingxing County in the Chiang-occupied Areas Intensively Enlist Soldiers
    Young and Strong Men Flee to Our Area
    Masses in Dangquan Village Oppose Enlistment and Beat Up the Head of the Bao.
    [Reported by this newspaper] The Chiang army is critically short of soldiers, and recently it has been conscripting soldiers on a large scale in its occupied areas. Young people are unwilling to die for its dictatorial civil war and have fled to the liberated areas. In Ji County, the Chiang army requires three conscripts from each bao, and six conscripts from each bao in the border areas. If there are no conscripts, 15 shi of rice must be paid per person. The head of the Baoding Street Bao was beating a gong to call the conscripts to assemble, but before the gong finished sounding, the young people had all run away. Li Wuzi and his brother, who run a mill in Yandian Street, fled to Shiping Village in the liberated area a few days ago. The village cadres in our area immediately went to express their sympathy and help them solve their difficulties. In the Chiang-occupied area of Jingxing, the conscription is causing panic, and everyone hopes that the Eighth Route Army will rescue them. The masses in Dangquan Village resolutely opposed conscription and beat up the head of the bao. The masses' struggle against conscription is developing universally. Our local government has issued a notice to rescue these young people who are unwilling to fight for the Chiang bandits in the civil war, pointing out the way for them, calling on them to come to the liberated areas, and organizing cadres to specialize in this work.

    汲县井陉蒋占区大抓丁
    青壮纷纷逃来我区
    当泉村群众反对抓丁痛打保长
    【本报讯】蒋军兵源奇缺，近在其侵占区大批抓丁，青年不愿为其独裁内战送死，纷纷逃来解放区。汲县蒋军每保要壮丁三名，在边沿区每保要壮丁六名，如无壮丁，每人交米十五石。城西街保长敲锣叫壮丁集合，锣没响完，青年完全跑光了。盐店街开磨房的李五子兄弟两个，于日前逃来解放区施平村，我区村干部立即前往慰问，并帮助其解决困难。井陉蒋占区抓丁，人心慌慌不安，都盼望八路军去解救他们。当泉村群众因坚决反对抓丁，把保长痛打了一顿。群众反抓丁的斗争，正在普遍发展中。我当地政府为抢救这批不愿替蒋贼内战的青年，特发出通告，给他们指明出路，号召到解放区来，并组织干部专门进行这一工作。
