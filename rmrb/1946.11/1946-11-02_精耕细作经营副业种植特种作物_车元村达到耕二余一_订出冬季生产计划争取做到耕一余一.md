　　Intensive Farming and Sideline Business with Special Crops:
    Che Yuan Village Achieves "Work Two, Surplus One"
    Sets Winter Production Plan to Strive for "Work One, Surplus One"
    [This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch dated 25th] Che Yuan Village in Licheng has victoriously completed its autumn harvest, exceeding the "Work Three, Surplus One" plan and achieving "Work Two, Surplus One." The village's fifteen hectares of autumn land yielded 1,119 more *shi* of coarse grains than last year, and the faces of men, women, and children alike are filled with the joy of harvest. On the 15th, the village held a harvest celebration and production model election rally. Every family ate well, and everyone wore new clothes, as if celebrating the New Year. At the meeting, the village chief summarized the year's production, saying: The reason for this year's increased production is that we listened to the government and carried out intensive farming and planted special crops. This year, all the land was fertilized with an average of 45 loads of manure per *mu*, and ordinary crops were hoed three times. "Golden Queen" corn was hoed four times, and cotton was hoed six times. "Golden Queen" yielded 1.7 *dou* more per *mu* than local corn, "August 1st" millet yielded 1.6 *dou* more per *mu* than local millet, and cotton yielded 40 *jin* per *mu*. Ordinary crops also yielded about 5 *dou* more per *mu* than in previous years. In addition, 36 laborers and 32 livestock engaged in transportation during the agricultural slack season, earning more than 840,000 *yuan* this year. The cooperative and sideline production earned 480,000 *yuan* in silver dollars, and women's textile production earned 740,000 *yuan* in silver dollars. The families of labor hero Lu Jicai and textile hero Guo Chunmei even achieved "Work One, Surplus Two." At the meeting, 70 production models and activists, including Lu Jicai, and 23 textile experts, including Guo Chunmei, were selected. Lu Jicai and Guo Chunmei also called for a larger-scale winter production campaign, proposing the resounding slogan: "To achieve 'Work One, Surplus One' for the whole village in this year's winter production." The village's winter production plan has now been formulated, with the main contents being: 1. Male laborers will engage in transportation production, earning 450,000 *yuan* in silver dollars this winter. 2. To carry out a larger-scale textile campaign, earning 720,000 *yuan* in silver dollars. 3. All villagers, young and old, will work together to accumulate 43,500 loads of fertilizer this winter to ensure that each *mu* of autumn land can be fertilized with more than 50 loads next year.
