    Collective Review Still Needs Another Overturn
    Two Thousand Heroes Meeting in Qin County Concludes
    [This Dispatch from Yangcheng, 14th] The six-day grand meeting of two thousand overturned heroes in Qin County has now concluded. Village and district discussions and model reports at the conference revealed many models for leading the overturn: for example, Zhang Shuncheng of Dongpo, who was able to mobilize people based on their level of awareness, starting from concrete experience, and "knitted together" one hundred and twenty suffering people in less than a month. Those who had not thoroughly overturned spoke out at the conference about their grievances. Li Wanghai from Nanquan reported that he had not yet overturned, saying: "I don't have land. Wherever I reclaim wasteland, it's already owned. They don't say anything when I'm clearing it, but when it's about to be harvested, the owner appears and demands rent. Now, the Communist Party is leading us to overturn, it is like my own dear mother. This time when I go back, not only will I settle accounts with the landlords, but there are also many people from Lin County near me, and I will make them overturn too." Comrade Wang Biyan, chairman of the county farmers' association, pointed out in his summary: In the newly liberated areas, nearly 50,000 out of 90,000 people participated in the struggle. Our activists have played a great role, so everyone is a hero and a leader of the masses, but we cannot be satisfied with this. In the old and new areas of the county, out of a population of 120,000, there are still one-third of the people who have not been involved in the struggle. We should make persistent efforts to thoroughly settle accounts with traitors, despots, landlords, and feudal forces, so that all the people in the county can stand up and achieve land to the tiller. He called for: (1) Expanding our struggle situation, the poor should go among the poor, the suffering among the suffering, and the poor and suffering should unite and overturn together; (2) Expanding the farmers' association organization, so that one person joins the association, and everyone joins the association; (3) Developing armed forces and developing the militia; (4) The farmers of the whole county must be urgently mobilized to support the front line, strive for the victory of the patriotic self-defense war, and repel Chiang Kai-shek's attack; and pay attention to saving and preparing for famine.

    集体检查还须再翻身
    沁县两千英雄会闭幕
    【本报阳城十四日电】沁县两千翻身英雄的大集会历时六日，现已闭会，在村区讨论及大会的典型报告中，发现了不少领导翻身的模范：如东坡张顺成，能根据每个人的觉悟程度，从具体经验出发，进行动员，不到一月的工夫，“圪联”了一百二十个苦人。没有翻透身的曾在大会上展开诉苦，南泉李旺孩报告他还没有翻了身，他说：“自己没地，到那儿开荒都有主，开时不说，种上快收的时候就有主了，非要租子不行，现在共产党领导咱翻身，就是我的亲大娘，这次回去，不但我要和地主算，我临近的林县人很多，也要叫他们翻身。”县农会主席王弼延同志于总结时指出：在新解放区九万人中将近五万人参加了斗争，我们的积极分子，是起了很大作用的，因此大家都是英雄和群众的领袖，但我们不能因此而满足。全县在新老区十二万人中，还有三分之一的人口，没有卷入斗争，我们应当再接再厉，向汉奸、恶霸、地主、封建势力彻底清算，让全县的人民都翻起身来，达到耕者有其田，他号召：（一）、扩大我们的斗争局面，穷人到穷人中去，苦人到苦人中去，穷人和苦人团结起来，一齐翻身；（二）、扩大农会组织，要作到一人入会，大家入会；（三）、发展武装、发展民兵；（四）、全县的农民要紧急动员起来，支援前线，争取爱国自卫战争的胜利，打退蒋介石的进攻；并注意节约备荒。
