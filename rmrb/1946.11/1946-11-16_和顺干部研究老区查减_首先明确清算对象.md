    Heshun Cadres Study Land Reform in Old Liberated Areas
    First Clarify the Objects of Liquidation
    [This Newspaper's Report] The Heshun County Committee convened key cadres from the old liberated areas last month, based on the specific circumstances of the investigations in these areas, to discuss how to implement "Land to the Tiller" this winter. The discussion centered on who should be subject to liquidation and who should be considered "new rich peasants." After discussing specific individuals one by one, they identified the following as targets for liquidation: First, feudal landlords whose political and economic power has not been crushed. Although these landlords have been weakened to some extent by years of land reform, the mobilization of the masses was insufficient at the time. They only sold off some bad land, and still rely on good land to exploit peasants. Second, many landlords and feudal rich peasants have long controlled village administration, or have used various means to co-opt cadres, forming a backstage support for village administration to maintain their feudal rule, preventing peasants from ever having the opportunity to turn over. In one village with 290 households, a thorough investigation this autumn revealed that there are still 123 extremely poor and poor peasant households. Third, there are quite a few landlords or rich peasants with feudal vestiges who went bankrupt due to speculative business or other reasons before the war, and after the rent reduction in 1942, have become exploiters who gain without labor. The masses call them "resurrected from the ashes," but in reality, they have taken advantage of our policies. Fourth, landlords and feudal rich peasants who conceal hidden land by pawning it at low prices or faking family divisions. In one village, Hao, in order to escape liquidation by the masses, used the excuse of "family division" to claim he was a "middle peasant" to evade the masses' liquidation. Landlords in one village used the method of mortgaging land for five mao to pass on all burdens. All of the above should be subject to thorough liquidation by mobilizing the masses.
    Another situation is that after the rent reduction policy of 1942, some cadres, like the cadres in the movement last winter, used their "priority" rights to buy large amounts of land. However, most of these cadres are from the basic masses, so in this winter's movement, they should be persuaded to return a portion so that the broad masses of peasants can obtain land.
    Secondly, under our Party's policy of rent and interest reduction, new rich peasants who have truly turned over and started their businesses through labor, such as Ma Lianqu's Li Xingde, are those who actively engaged in labor and production after obtaining land after the 1942 rent reduction, accumulated grain, bought donkeys, and even developed to the point of hiring long-term laborers. Everyone agreed that this type of new rich peasant should not be infringed upon in any way in this winter's movement.
    Finally, everyone agreed that in this winter's movement, not only should the industrial and commercial sector not be infringed upon, but attention should also be paid to helping landlords and rich peasants who have switched to other industries or helping them invest in industry and commerce. Xu Fuyuan of Ma Lianqu is a rich peasant who hires workers, but the proportion of land to his population is not disparate, and there is no feudal exploitation. Xu himself does not participate in agricultural production, but specializes in driving livestock for commercial production. Such rich peasants should be supported in their development.

    和顺干部研究老区查减
    首先明确清算对象
    【本报讯】和顺县委会于上月召集老区主要干部，依据老区调查之具体情况，讨论今冬如何在老区贯彻耕者有其田，该清算的是那些人？那些算新富农等问题。经过对具体人事逐一讨论后，大家找出该清算之对象为：第一、封建地主在政治经济上没有被打垮的。地主虽经历年查减有部分削弱，但因当时发动群众不够，仅卖掉一部分坏地，至今仍恃好地盘剥农民。第二、不少地主和封建富农，长期掌握村政，或以各种方式拉拢干部，形成支撑村政的后台，以维持其封建统治，致使农民永得不到翻身机会。某村共二百九十户，今秋经深入调查，发现仍有赤贫、贫农一百二十三户。第三、有不少经营地主或带有封建尾巴的富农，因战前做投机生意或其他原因，顿时荡产，经四二年减租，又成不劳而获的剥削者，群众叫他们是“死灰复燃”，实际是投了我们政策之机。第四、是为了掩藏隐蔽土地，低价典当或假分家的地主及封建富农，某村郝某就是为了逃避群众清算，则以分家说他是“中农”来搪塞群众清算。某村地主以五毛钱出典土地来转嫁一切负担，以上都应发动群众予以彻底清算。
    另一种是经过四二年减租，一些干部和去冬运动的干部一样，以“手在胳膊头”的“优先”权买进了大批土地，但这些干部大部又是基本群众，那么在今冬运动中，就应以说服办法让其退出一部，使广大农民获得土地。
    其次在我党减租减息政策下，真正翻身而劳动起家的新富农，如马连曲李兴德，就是经过四二年减租后获得了土地积极劳动生产，并积攒了粮食，买下驴，又发展到雇长工。大家一致认为在今冬运动中丝毫不能侵犯这一类型的新富农。
    最后，大家一致认为，在今冬不仅不应该侵犯工商业部分，而且还要注意地主、富农转业或帮助扶植其投资工商业。马连曲徐福元是富农，虽雇佣工人，但土地与其人口比例并不悬殊，且也没有封建剥削，徐个人不参加农业生产，专门赶牲口做商业生产，像这样的富农应扶植其发展。
