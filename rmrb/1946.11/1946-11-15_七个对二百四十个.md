    Seven Against Two Hundred and Forty
    Wu Xiang, Yin Jinsheng
    In the Juye Campaign to annihilate the 119th Brigade, seven soldiers of the 9th Company of the 3024th Regiment of the Eighth Route Army, in Li Hujiazhuang, blocked the Nationalist soldiers breaking out from Liujiazhuang. At the cost of one lightly wounded, they captured three machine guns and twenty-three rifles, killed or wounded over one hundred Nationalist soldiers, and captured one hundred and thirty-seven alive.
    Among the seven soldiers, Squad Leader Xu Tieli and Deputy Squad Leader Ding Shanming were both liberated during the Shangdang Campaign. Soldier Yi Dezhi came from the 18th Brigade of the 11th Division during the Longhai Campaign. Han Zhendong and Hu Decheng had just recently laid down their weapons from the 41st Division. Chang Zhengjin was a new recruit from Cixian who had only joined in June. Of the seven, only Zhao Yuyi was a veteran of the Eighth Route Army.
    The entire company had been unable to sleep or eat for two days and two nights. After receiving the task, the squad leader led the seven men to construct fortifications nervously on the road in the northwest corner of the village. Hunger, fatigue, and the threat of constant bombing and strafing by Nationalist planes could not stop them for a minute. At sunset, several groups of Nationalist soldiers desperately ran south. Although they had been badly battered by our pursuing troops, they were not yet completely disorganized. Officers were still yelling and forcing soldiers to charge ahead to clear a path. Squad Leader Xu knew that if they didn't concentrate their forces to overwhelm them first, they might not be able to disarm and capture them. When the Nationalist soldiers approached within a hundred meters, he suddenly led everyone to throw several hand grenades in a row. Deputy Squad Leader Ding Shanming carried his machine gun and began to fire fiercely, until the gun barrel became so hot that his thumb blistered, but he didn't stop. A Nationalist officer on horseback fell. Another officer in a sanitary uniform was hit. The chaotic sounds and smoke blended into one. The Nationalist soldiers were only concerned with escaping for their lives. Squad Leader Xu then cleverly dispersed everyone, leaving the panic-stricken Nationalist soldiers with nowhere to escape. Twenty-odd Nationalist soldiers fled into an alley, using a machine gun to block the alley entrance, attempting to resist stubbornly. Veteran Zhao Yuyi wanted to charge in, but his nose was grazed. Chang Zhengjin then charged in alone. Two holes were shot through his sleeve, and the bolt of his Arisaka rifle was blown apart. He pulled the pin on a hand grenade, waved it, and said, "Disarm and no one will be killed. If you don't disarm, don't blame us for being impolite." Taking advantage of the guy's daze, he rushed forward and snatched the revolving machine gun. The Nationalist soldiers were all frightened and ran away. He pointed the machine gun and chased after them, shouting, "Where are you running? If you run again, I'll use the machine gun!" So the Nationalist soldiers had no choice but to disarm.
    Each of the seven men shouted out to the enemy, with Han Zhendong and Hu Decheng, who had just come over from the 41st Division, shouting the most and the loudest. Han Zhendong was from Anhui and had served in the transport company of the 119th Brigade (later, he was captured by the 41st Division while on a business trip). Most of the 119th Brigade were his old fellow villagers from Anhui. When eighty Nationalist soldiers fled into a house, he shouted, "Come out, surrender your weapons and nothing will happen. I've only been over here for less than a month." When the people inside heard his Anhui accent, they all threw their guns out the window. Then they ran out and tightly surrounded him, grabbing his hand and asking, "Really not killing us?" He laughed and said, "If they were killing people, would I be here? I used to be in the 119th Brigade, I know Regiment Commander Kan and Brigade Commander Liu." The prisoners were relieved.
    As soon as the battle ended, the seven of them gathered the one hundred and thirty-seven prisoners in the yard, helped them dry the clothes that had gotten wet when they jumped into the river to escape. In the warm firelight, Squad Leader Xu kindly comforted them and told them the story of how he himself became an Eighth Route Army soldier.

    七个对二百四十个
    吴象  殷金生
    歼灭一一九旅的鄄城战役中，八路军三○二四部队第九连的七个战士，在李胡庄堵击从刘家庄突围的蒋军，以一人轻伤的代价，缴机枪三挺，步枪二十三支，毙伤蒋军一百多，生俘一百三十七名。
    七个战士中班长许铁六付班长丁善明都是上党战役中解放过来的，战士易得志是陇海战役中从十一师十八旅过来的，韩振东、胡得成是目前才从四一师放下武器过来的，常正金是六月才入伍的磁县新战士，七个人中只有赵雨义一个人是八路军的老战士。
    整个连已经两天两夜顾不得睡觉吃饭了，班长在接受任务后，就带领七个人在村西北角的路上紧张地构筑工事，饥饿、疲劳和蒋机不断轰炸扫射的威胁都不能使他们停顿一分钟。日落时分，蒋军好几路不要命的向南跑来，虽然已被我追击部队打得很狼狈，但尚未完全混乱，官长们还在吆喝着威逼士兵冲锋开路。许班长知道如果不先集中力量把他们压倒，怕就无法缴枪捉俘虏了。等蒋军接近到一百米时，他突然领导大家一连打了几个手榴弹，副班长丁善明扛起机枪向前猛烈扫射，直到枪身发烫，把他的大姆指烫起了泡还不停止。一个骑马的蒋军军官跌下来了，又一个穿卫生衣的军官中弹了，杂乱的声响和烟雾混成一团，蒋军只顾各自逃命了，许班长又机敏地把大家分散，使惊慌万分的蒋军到处无隙可逃。二十几个蒋军逃进了巷子，用机枪封锁住巷口企图顽抗，老战士赵雨义想冲进去，鼻子上挂彩了。常正金又独自迎面冲进去，他袖口上被打穿了两个洞，三八式的枪拴也被打炸了，他揭开手榴弹盖，拉着线扬了扬说：“缴枪一个不杀，不缴枪就不客气了。”他乘那家伙正在发楞，抢一步上去夺了那架转盘机枪，蒋军都吓跑了，他端着机枪追上去叫道：“往那里跑？再跑我就要打机枪了！”于是蒋军只好都缴了枪。
    他们七个人每个人都进行喊话，从四十一师才过来的韩振东和胡得成喊得最多最起劲。韩振东是安徽人，曾在一一九旅运输连当过兵（后来在出差时被四一师抓了去），一一九旅大部都是他的安徽老乡，当八十个蒋军逃进一间屋子时，他便叫：“出来吧，缴枪啥事没有，我也才过来不到一个月哩。”屋里人听见他的安徽口音，都把枪从窗口扔出来，接着就跑出来紧紧围着他，抓住他的手问：“真的不杀吗？”他笑着说：“杀的话还有我吗？我从前也在一一九旅，阚团长刘旅长我都认得哩。”俘虏们都放心了。
    战斗刚结束，他们七个人就把一百三十七个俘虏集中到院里，帮他们烤干跳河逃跑时弄湿了的衣服，在温暖的火光中，许班长亲切的安慰他们，并向他们叙述他自己怎样当了八路军的故事。
