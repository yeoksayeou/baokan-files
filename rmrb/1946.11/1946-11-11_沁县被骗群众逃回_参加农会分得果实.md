[This article was transmitted by this newspaper from Yangcheng on the 2nd] Before the liberation of Qin County, the traitor Duan Bingchang gathered fugitive landlords and local bullies to form a "Revenge Squad," spreading rumors that the Eighth Route Army had entered the city and would burn and kill everything... As a result, some of the masses near the city who did not understand our policies were deceived and retreated to Taiyuan with Duan when our army liberated Qin County, where they were incorporated into a "comfort delegation." After three months of eating United Nations relief supplies, they could not solve the problem of their livelihood. They robbed outside the city and were attacked by the militia everywhere, so they dared not go five miles outside the city. Zhang Hanjun, the former puppet county magistrate of Qin County, then reorganized them into a "Homecoming Corps." They asked to go home, but were not allowed, so they tried to escape. Silversmith Chang Zaixiao and Ge Bingsheng and others fled back to the liberated area, and with the approval of the masses, joined the Farmers' Association and shared more than 400 yuan in the fruits of labor. Chang Zaixiao said: "Our liberated area is truly a paradise, while the Chiang Kai-shek and puppet-occupied areas are hell."
