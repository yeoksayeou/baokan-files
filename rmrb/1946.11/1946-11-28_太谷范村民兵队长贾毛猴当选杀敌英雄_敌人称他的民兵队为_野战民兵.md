　　[From our Changzhi correspondent] Following the victory of the heroic defense battle of Zhongshan Geta, Taigu militia killing-the-enemy hero Jia Mao Hou has performed another extraordinary feat. On the 4th of this month, Mao Hou led the Yuancun militia, coordinating with a unit of the county's independent battalion, ambushing more than 80 enemies who invaded Dongjia Village. Mao Hou's militia split into two groups and charged together upon discovering the enemy, seizing a light machine gun. Subsequently, they more dynamically and independently pursued the enemy, seizing a light cannon, two rifles, and numerous military supplies along the way.

　　Prior to this battle, Jia Mao Hou and his militia had already used landmine warfare to defeat the enemy when they invaded Fancun to loot grain on the 31st of last month. The enemy detonated five giant mines at the edge of the village, injuring eight. According to statistics, in recent months alone, Jia Mao Hou and his militia have engaged in 15 major independent battles, killing, wounding, or capturing 36 enemy and puppet soldiers, seizing two machine guns, three rifles, a light cannon, and over a hundred rounds of ammunition. Recently, at the county-wide heroes' conference, Mao Hou was selected as the county's first-class killing-the-enemy hero, awarded a rifle and a banner. Note: Jia Mao Hou is 25 years old and serves as the director of the Fancun Armed Committee. He is brave and bold, calm and careful in battle. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he worked in the underground army with considerable success. At this county-wide heroes' conference, he spoke freely about his leadership of the militia and his combat experience. Mao Hou is good at uniting the masses, and to this day, many young people in the enemy-occupied areas are his good helpers and informants. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he was active in the enemy and puppet heartland of the county. After Yan Xishan's puppet regime ruled Taigu, it tried several times to eliminate Jia Mao Hou's militia, but this militia grew stronger and became a thorn in the enemy's side, achieving numerous feats over the past eight years. Even the enemy had to call them the "Fancun Armed Work Team" or "Field Militia."

　　太谷范村民兵队长贾毛猴当选杀敌英雄
    敌人称他的民兵队为“野战民兵”
    【本报长治讯】继中山圪塔英雄坚守战之胜利后，太谷民兵杀敌英雄贾毛猴又建奇功。本月四日，毛猴率领苑村民兵配合该县独立营一部埋伏东贾村阻击进犯该村敌八十余人，毛猴民兵队分二股于发现敌人后一齐冲上去，夺敌轻机枪一挺，继而更机动地单独追击敌人，途中夺敌轻炮一门，步枪两支，军用品甚多。
    此次战斗前，贾毛猴及其民兵队曾于上月三十一日敌犯范村抢粮时，以地雷封锁战击溃敌军，敌在村边踏响五个巨雷，被炸伤八人。统计近几月来，仅贾毛猴及其民兵单独的主要战斗即达十五次，其毙伤俘敌伪三十六名，缴获机枪两挺，步枪三支，轻炮一门，子弹百余发。最近该县群英大会上，毛猴被选为全县一等杀敌英雄，奖步枪一支，锦旗一面。按：贾毛猴现年二十五岁，任范村武委会主任，为人勇敢胆大，战斗中沉着细心。抗战时曾作地下军工作，颇有成绩。在此次该县群英会上曾畅谈其领导民兵及战斗经验，毛猴善于团结群众，至今敌游区有许多青年都是他活动的好助手和内线。抗日战争时，他活跃于该县敌伪心脏中，阎伪统治太谷后，几次想消灭贾毛猴的民兵队，但这支民兵队却更壮大了，成了敌人心腹之患，八年来屡建功绩，连敌人也不得不称他们为“范村武工队”或“野战民兵”。
