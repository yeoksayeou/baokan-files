    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] Chiang Kai-shek's army has mobilized heavy troops to attack the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, arousing the greatest anger among the military personnel and civilians in this region. The person in charge of the Central Bureau of the CCP Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu stated to our reporter: "Chiang Kai-shek is holding a divisive and puppet National Congress while attacking Yan'an, the source of the Chinese revolution and the location of the headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. All military personnel and civilians in the region must rise up to fight to defend the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao." He further pointed out: "Chiang Kai-shek's desperate attack on Yan'an marks the culmination of his offensive against the liberated areas; this will only accelerate his own destruction." The person in charge continued to call: "The military personnel and civilians in the border region should develop the spirit of hard struggle a hundredfold, abandon peaceful illusions, prepare for a more arduous life, and adapt all aspects of life to the needs of the war. They must strictly obey orders, strictly observe discipline, unite as one, and strive to defeat the Chiang bandits. They must loudly accept Comrade Liu Shaoqi's call, first strictly obey orders, strictly observe discipline, and not allow the excuse of 'solving problems ideologically' to discuss any problem, even repeatedly; but to serve the war wholeheartedly, defend Chairman Mao, defend the liberated areas, and defend all the Chinese people."
    Chairman Yang of the Border Region Government stated: "Under the brilliant command of General Liu Bocheng, the military personnel and civilians of Ji-Lu-Yu annihilated 55,000 of Chiang's elite troops. Our military personnel and civilians are becoming stronger and stronger as they fight, truly implementing Comrade Liu Shaoqi's call to change organizational forms and lifestyles, practice strict economy, and do everything for the sake of eliminating more invading troops. This is the most effective way to defend the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region." Wang Naitang, Secretary-General of the Border Region Assembly, stated: "The people of this region vow to be the rear guard of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, and will never give up until Chiang's offensive is completely crushed!" All the staff and workers of the People's Daily Printing Factory are working tensely under the slogan of "Defend the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, work harder!" Writer Zhao Shuli is working hard on his writing even while sick. Zhao Zhuang Village in Wu'an is holding a mass production summary and hero selection meeting. After hearing the news, Jing Hongzhang, a newly liberated farmer, tore open his new cotton-padded jacket and pointed to everyone's new cotton clothes, saying: "This is all thanks to Chairman Mao! It's time to repay the favor." The whole audience shouted in unison, "That's right!" Jing Qiufu, the 50-year-old leader of the mutual aid team, shouted loudly: "Those with guns, take up your guns; those with knives, take up your knives; those without knives or guns, organize a 'stone team' and fight Chiang Kai-shek to the death!"

    中央局负责同志号召全区军民
    保卫党中央和毛主席
    严守纪律服从命令全心全意服务战争
    【本报特讯】蒋军调集重兵进攻陕甘宁边区，激起本区军民最大的愤怒。中共晋冀鲁豫中央局负责人顷向本报记者表示：“蒋介石一面召开分裂的御用的国大，一面进攻中国革命策源地和中国人民解放军总部所在地——延安。全区军民必须奋起为保卫中共中央和毛主席而斗争。”继指出：“蒋介石孤注一掷进攻延安，标志其进攻解放区已达顶点；这只有加速其自身的毁灭。”该负责人继续号召：“边区军民应百倍发扬艰苦奋斗的精神，抛弃和平幻想，准备过更艰苦的生活，一切生活必须适应战争需要，严格服从命令，严格遵守纪律，大家团结起来，为击败蒋贼而努力奋斗，响亮接受刘少奇同志的号召，首先严格服从命令，严格遵守纪律，不允许借口‘从思想上解决问题’，对什么问题都要讨论，甚至反复讨论；而要全心全意的服务战争，保卫毛主席，保卫解放区，保卫全中国人民。”
    边府杨主席谈称：“在刘伯承将军天才指挥下，冀鲁豫军民歼灭蒋贼精锐五万五千人，我方军民愈战愈强，真正实行刘少奇同志改变组织形式与生活方式的号召，厉行节衣缩食，一切为了更多的消灭进犯军，这就是最有效的保卫陕甘宁边区。”边区参议会王乃堂秘书长谈称：“本区人民誓为陕甘宁边区后盾，不完全粉碎蒋贼进攻，决不甘休！”人民日报印刷厂全体职工，在“保卫陕甘宁边区，更加油干啊”的口号下，紧张地工作着。作家赵树理正带病紧张地创作。武安赵庄村正在召开群众生产总结和评选英雄大会，听到这个消息后，新翻身户荆鸿章掠开自已的新棉袄，又指着大家的新棉衣说：“这都是毛主席的恩情啊！这是报恩的时候了。”全场一致喊“对！”五十岁的老互助组长荆秋福高声喊出：“有枪的拿枪，有刀的拿刀，没刀没枪的组织‘石头队’跟蒋介石拚命！”
