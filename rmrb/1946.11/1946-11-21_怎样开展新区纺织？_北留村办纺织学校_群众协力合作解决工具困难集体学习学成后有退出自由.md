　　The Textile School in Beiliu Village
    Masses Cooperate to Solve Tool Difficulties, Collective Learning, Freedom to Withdraw After Completion
    [This newspaper, Yangcheng, 17th dispatch] Beiliu Village in Yangcheng County, in order to achieve self-sufficiency in clothing within two years, has adopted the method of a textile school to train female textile workers and impart textile technology, becoming a good way to develop the textile industry in the new area. The Beiliu Village Textile School was established on the second day of the tenth lunar month last year, organized enthusiastically by Wang Anhe, a primary school teacher, and Li Chunxuan, a villager. More than 30 women enrolled to learn spinning. At that time, there was not a single spinning wheel in the village, and they did not have the capital to buy spinning wheels. A comrade Jia lent them 1,200 yuan. They mobilized wood from the homes of women learning to spin and asked the village carpenter to cut spinning wheels, stating that the wage was 80 yuan per wheel, 40 yuan to be paid first, and the remaining 40 yuan to be paid after the women earned money by spinning thread. In this way, 30 spinning wheels were made. Subsequently, they mobilized women to bring half a catty or four taels of cotton from their homes to study, and hired Guo Shuanghe, an iron machine worker in the village, as a teacher. However, after the thread was spun, it could not be woven into cloth without a weaving machine. Just then, Jia Zhihai and Zhao Gengxin sent their daughters to study textile, and he took out one stone and two dou of millet to make a shuttle loom. One steel bearing on the machine required 6,000 yuan, and they bought copper bearings for 800 yuan to replace it. These people were all beginners in textile, and the thread they spun was not good. Therefore, it was proposed to improve the quality of the thread, and standards for good and bad thread were set. After a month of efforts, the number of female spinners increased from more than 30 to more than 50, and the organizational scale was roughly in place. The school was led by Wang Anhe and Li Chunxuan, with education, hygiene, and technology committees established. Students arrived early in the morning, brought food from home, and stayed overnight at home. The spun thread and woven cloth were then used for shareholding within the school. Before the wheat harvest this year, a total of 13,000 yuan of capital was raised. Currently, there are four shuttle looms, four plain looms, one towel loom, more than 50 spinning machines, 100 bolts of cloth, and a profit of 53,000 yuan. Twenty-two skilled workers who can both spin and weave have emerged. After the autumn harvest, they will concentrate their efforts to spin thread and weave cloth for themselves for a month to prepare for the winter season. This year, the village planted 320 mu of cotton, with each mu yielding 15 jin of clean cotton, totaling 4,800 jin. Coupled with their achievements over the past year, this has laid a solid foundation for large-scale development. Therefore, they have made new plans this spring, preparing to develop 50 more female spinners to study at the school (not including female spinners studying at home), cutting a total of 100 spinning wheels and 13 shuttle looms, turning the school into a factory. The cloth woven by five looms is considered as belonging to the factory, and the rest of the woven cloth is for the female spinners' own use. After completing their studies, those who do not want to continue spinning and weaving in the school can go home to spin and weave. To encourage female spinners, the school, in addition to profit sharing, has established a wage system. For spinning first-class thread for the school, the wage is 200 yuan per jin, 160 yuan for second-class thread, 10 yuan per jin for winding thread, and 5 yuan per foot for weaving good cloth and 3 yuan for substandard cloth.

　　怎样开展新区纺织？
    北留村办纺织学校
    群众协力合作解决工具困难集体学习学成后有退出自由
    【本报阳城十七日电】阳城北留村，为了做到两年内穿衣自给，采用纺织学校的办法，培养纺织妇女，传学纺织技术，成为新区开展纺织的好办法。北留村纺织学校，成立于去年阴历十月初二，由小学教员王安和及村人李春萱，热心组织起来，入学纺妇三十多人，当时村中没有一架纺车，他们又没有购买纺车的资本，一位贾同志，借给他们大洋一千二百元，他们向学习纺织的妇女家中，动员木料，请本村木匠割纺花车，言明每割一辆车，工资八十元，先给四十元，其余四十元，待妇女纺线赚了钱再给，这样就割成了三十个纺纱车。随后，他们一面动员妇女，从家中带上半斤四两花来学习，一面聘请本村铁机工人郭双和当教师，但是纺成线后，没机织不成布，适有贾志孩赵庚辛送他女孩来学习纺织，他拿出一石二斗小米，做了一架拉梭机，机上的钢轴眼一个就需要六千元，他们用八百元买了铜轴眼来代替，这些人都在初学纺织，纺的线都不好，于是便提出提高线的质量，又规定了好坏线的标准。经过一月的努力，纺妇由三十多人增加到五十多人，组织规模已大体就绪，学校由王安和、李春萱负责领导，下设教育委员、卫生委员、技术委员，学生一清早就到，吃饭是从家里送来，晚上回家住宿，纺好的线和织好的布，又在校内入股，今年麦收前，共集股本一万三千元。现有拉梭机四架，平机四架，毛巾机一架，纺纱机五十多架，织布一百匹，赚洋五万三千元。能纺能织的全把式已有二十二人，秋收后集中精力给自己纺线织布一个月，以备今冬换季。今年该村植棉三百二十亩，每亩可产净花十五斤，共四千八百斤，再加上他们一年来的成绩，这就打下大量发展的基础。所以他们今春又作了新的计划，准备在原有基础上，再发展纺妇五十人到学校学习，（在自己家中学习的纺妇不在内），共割纺纱车一百架，拉梭机十三架，把学校变成工厂，五架机织的布算作工厂的，其余织的布都由纺妇自用，学成以后，不想继续在学校内纺织的可以回家纺织，学校为鼓励纺妇，除入股分红外，规定了工资制，给学校纺头等线，每斤工资二百元，二等线一百六十元，络线每斤十元，织好布，每尺五元次布三元。
