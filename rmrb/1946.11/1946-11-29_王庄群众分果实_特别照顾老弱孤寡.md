[By our newspaper's Weixian correspondent, 26th of this month] When the masses of Wangzhuang, east of Feixiang city, distributed the fruits of the struggle, they especially cared for the old, weak, and widowed. They all received first-class shares. Besides providing houses for those without and land for those without, they also received more of other properties than the average person. Ordinary extremely poor households only received 10,000 yuan, but they received 16,820 yuan. Old widow Jin Hua Niang happily said, "If it weren't for the Communist Party, who would have treated us like human beings?" This care for the old, weak, and widowed was supported by the broad masses, who all said, "They should get more; that's only right!"

　　王庄群众分果实
    特别照顾老弱孤寡
    【本报威县二十六日电】肥乡城东王庄分配斗争果实时，特别照顾了老弱孤寡。他们都分头等果实。除没房给房、没地给地外，其他财物比一般人也分得多。一般的极贫户只分一万元，他们分一万六千八百二十元。老寡妇金花娘很高兴的说：“要不是共产党来，谁拿咱当过人？”这样照顾老弱孤寡，得到广大群众的拥护，大家都说：“就得叫他们多批点才是正理！”
