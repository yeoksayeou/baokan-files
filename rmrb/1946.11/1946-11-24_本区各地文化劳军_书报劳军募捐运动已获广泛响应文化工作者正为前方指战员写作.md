　　Cultural Support Activities in Various Areas of Our Region
    Book and Newspaper Donation Campaign Widely Responded To; Cultural Workers Writing for Frontline Soldiers
    [This newspaper's dispatch] A cultural support movement has been launched in various areas of our region. The Propaganda Department of the Central Bureau has already spent over 220,000 yuan to purchase more than 2,000 books to send to the front lines. The book and newspaper donation campaign initiated by "New Masses" has been widely responded to, raising more than 174,000 yuan in one month. All employees of the Yongxing Hotel in Jinnan donated over 8,000 yuan. Xie Chengshun, a cook at Wu'an No. 8 High School, saw the students donating and said, "Although I cannot go to the front to fight the stubborn army, I will give 25 yuan to do my part." Wu'an No. 7 District has also widely carried out fundraising. Maluo Village alone donated 4,200 yuan, and the teachers and students of No. 7 High School, including the cooks, donated a total of more than 12,000 yuan. During a fundraising event at the Yunzu Street market in Yushe, a veteran named Xie Shuyun donated 500 yuan and said, "I know the hardship of frontline soldiers not being able to see books and newspapers." After hearing about the frontline soldiers' need for books and newspapers, the masses in Dongbaiyu Village, LiCheng No. 4 District, immediately spoke up. Family member of a soldier, Shi Tian, said, "My brother, Shuan Tian, is a soldier in the 50th Regiment. When he left, he couldn't read, but when he came back last year, he recognized many characters. I am willing to donate 50 yuan to buy books and newspapers for them." Labor hero Ma Hu'er said, "I am old, and I was only liberated when the Eighth Route Army came. Everyone elected me as a labor hero. When it comes to the Eighth Route Army, they are better than my own children. I will donate 20 yuan so they can study hard." After receiving donations from various places, "New Masses" has successively sent books and newspapers to the front lines. As of now, a total of three batches, totaling 1,521 books, have been sent. In order to facilitate mass contributions, the Border Region Postal Administration has issued a notice to all post offices to deliver comfort items quickly and free of charge.
    [Another dispatch] Cultural workers in the Border Region have mobilized to write for the frontline soldiers. The Research Office of the General Office of the Central Bureau is writing a booklet about the situation in the Chiang-controlled areas for the front lines. The Xinhua Bookstore Editorial Department has launched a campaign to sing the praises of heroes. Miao Peishi has already written four drum verses, from singing the praises of a hundred heroes to the annihilation battle of Dayang Lake. He will soon publish a book of drum verses called "A Hundred Heroes." He also plans to sing about all the heroes in all the battles. Zhang Rong has compiled a collection of stories called "Heroes Defending the Border Region." In addition, he is also rewriting popular stories from the Soviet Patriotic Self-Defense War for the soldiers to read. Zhao Shuli has compiled and published "Fu Gui." In addition, the editorial department is also preparing to publish stories of heroic support for the front lines from the rear, stories of uprisings by Chiang's army and peasant uprisings in Chiang's areas, as well as short Soviet patriotic war novels. It is planned to publish 15 kinds of books for frontline soldiers to read within the next month or two. Cultural workers in the Taiyue District, under the call of Sun Dingguo, deputy commander of the military region, to "write about soldiers," have also begun to write. Recently, they have successively published various novels and plays such as "Hot Tears and Others," "Rotten Beef," "The Landlord's Treat," "Water Pushes the Great Wall," "Seven Warriors," and "Brave People." "Literary Magazine" and "Northern Magazine" have both published articles calling for pens to be directed towards the front lines.
