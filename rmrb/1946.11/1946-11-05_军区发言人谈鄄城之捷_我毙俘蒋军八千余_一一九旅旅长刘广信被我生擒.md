[Urgent Dispatch from the JiluYu Front, This Newspaper, 3rd] A spokesperson for the Jinji-Luyu Military Region, in announcing the victorious results of the Battle of Juancheng to this newspaper's reporter, stated: The Battle of Juancheng began on the evening of October 29 and ended at dusk on October 31. In less than 48 hours, the entire 119th Brigade of the 68th Division (military changed to division) and the entire 86th Regiment of the 29th Brigade (division changed to brigade) of the 55th Division (military changed to division), which had invaded the area south of Juancheng, were annihilated. The 241st Regiment of the 81st Brigade (division changed to brigade), urgently transferred from Heze to reinforce, was also partially eliminated by our forces. According to the results of the investigation, in addition to killing and wounding over 3,000 Chiang officers and soldiers, including Zhang Wenbin, the regimental commander of the 86th Regiment, and the regimental commander of the 356th Regiment, XXX, we captured over 5,500 officers and soldiers, including Liu Guangxin, the commander of the 119th Brigade (formerly division commander), and Regiment Commander Kan of the 355th Regiment, totaling over 8,500 Chiang officers and soldiers captured or annihilated. We seized eight American-made howitzers, seven mountain guns, thirty-seven mortars, ninety-five small cannons, sixty-five heavy machine guns, two hundred and eight light machine guns, fourteen anti-tank rifles, over three thousand three hundred rifles, twenty-two vehicles, eight radio stations, and a large quantity of ammunition and other military supplies. The spokesperson continued: Since the Longhai Campaign, under Chiang Kai-shek's policy of using miscellaneous troops to eliminate miscellaneous troops, the six brigades under the command of Liu Ruming's Fourth Pacification Zone have been reduced by four brigades annihilated by our army; this time, Gu Zhutong instructed Liu Ruming to advance north from Heze, in coordination with Qiu Qingquan's Fifth Army and Hu Lian's 18th Army (Organized 11th Division), to advance west along the Ju(ye) Yun(cheng) line, thinking that after occupying Juye and Yuncheng, they could drive straight in, forcing our army to retreat north of the old course of the Yellow River. (The recent acceleration of the Yellow River breach-closing project at Huayuankou is clearly a plan closely coordinated with the Chiang army's military operations.) Unexpectedly, under the severe blows of our army, the invading Chiang troops were completely destroyed. The Fifth Army and the 18th Army (Organized 11th Division) on the Juye-Yuncheng line, although hastily came to reinforce from the west of Juye and Yuncheng in three routes, were only able to advance five li in three days and three nights under our army's forceful resistance, and suffered six to seven hundred casualties, and could only helplessly wail. The spokesperson concluded in a relaxed and cheerful tone: This is Gu Zhutong's first major contribution since taking office. At the same time, we also use the victory of the Battle of Juancheng to celebrate the victories in Lianshui and Baoding, north and south, and the first anniversary of General Gao Shuxun's Handan Uprising in the Democratic National Construction Army on this day last year.

　　军区发言人谈鄄城之捷
    我毙俘蒋军八千余
    一一九旅旅长刘广信被我生擒
    【本报冀鲁豫前线三日急电】晋冀鲁豫军区发言人，顷对本社记者宣布鄄城之战，我军胜利战果称：鄄城之战，于十月二十九日晚开始，至三十一日黄昏结束，不到四十八小时内，将进犯我鄄城以南地区之蒋军六十八师（军改师）一百一十九旅全部，及五十五师（军改师）二十九旅（师改旅）之八十六团全部歼灭；由荷泽赶调增援之八十一旅（师改旅）二百四十一团，亦被我消灭一部。据清查结果，除毙伤蒋军官兵八十六团团长张文彬，三五六团团长×××以下三千余人外，俘虏一百一十九旅旅长（原师长）刘广信三百五十五团阚团长以下官兵五千五百余名，共计俘歼蒋军官兵八千五百余人。缴获美造榴弹炮八门，山炮七门，迫击炮三十七门，小炮九十五门，重机枪六十五挺，轻机枪二百零八挺，战防枪十四挺，步枪三千三百余支，汽车二十二辆，电台八部，子弹及其他军用品甚多。发言人继称：自陇海战役以来，在蒋介石利用杂牌、消灭杂牌政策下，刘汝明第四绥区所指挥下的六个旅，至此已被我军歼灭了四个旅；此次顾祝同指示刘汝明由荷泽北进，配合邱清泉之第五军及胡琏之第十八军（整十一师），沿巨（野）郓（城）线西进，满以为占我巨郓后，可以长驱直入，逼迫我军退过黄河故道以北。（近来花园口黄河堵口工程之加速进行，显系与蒋军军事行动密切配合之计划），不图在我军严重痛击下，使进犯蒋军遭到全部覆灭，其在巨郓一线之第五军及第十八军（整十一师），虽然急忙由巨郓以西地区分三路前来增援，但在我军有力阻击下，三天三夜只前进了五里，并同样遭到六七百名的伤亡，只能没精打彩的徒呼奈何而已。发言人最后以轻松愉快的口吻称：这是顾祝同上任以来的第一次重大贡献，同时我们也用鄄城之战这一胜利，来庆祝涟水、保定南北两捷，及民主建国军高树勋将军去年今日之邯郸起义一周年纪念。
