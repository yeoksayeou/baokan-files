Returning from a Visit to the Democratic Allied Army (Part 1)
    Su Di
    After visiting many soldiers, officers, and generals in the Democratic Allied Army, and observing their work and lives, I discovered that many things in this army are undergoing metabolism, a new life transforming from the old army to a "people's force" is growing rapidly.

    When we visited the First Battalion of the First Regiment, each company was giving lessons separately. The soldiers, wearing new cotton uniforms, sat on grass mats they had woven themselves. The classroom was an open-air square, and each company's wall newspaper was hung on the wall of the field house. The articles, with their varied handwriting, genuinely revealed the soldiers' emotions, likes, and dislikes. The × Company's wall newspaper had thirty-seven articles, twelve commemorating the Handan Uprising, seven depicting their happy lives, and the rest cursing Chiang Kai-shek and the United States. A soldier named Liu Deyu drew an ancient general and wrote: "I oppose Yue Fei's foolish loyalty, and support Chairman Mao for the people." He began to draw a line between the old and new great men, and therefore he was very "grateful to General Gao Shuxun for leading the Handan Uprising."
    The Fourth Regiment's residence was tidy and clean, and they firmly inherited this excellent tradition of the Northwest Army. Each squad had soldiers' calligraphy copybooks hanging on the walls, and the vegetable fund accounts settled by the economic committee selected by the soldiers themselves were also posted. The calligraphy copybooks combined "calligraphy practice" and "diary writing," recording in detail their daily learning experiences, major life events, and opinions on comrades and officers. When officers made corrections, they could absorb these opinions and understand the situation of the troops. In a certain company, most of the cadres and soldiers were illiterate in the past, but illiteracy has been almost eliminated in the past year, and the most literate have learned up to 800 characters. Improving culture is one of the many reasons why soldiers are satisfied today.
    In a small unit of the Fourth Division, I saw soldiers eating. White noodles were mixed with green spinach, and a thick layer of oil floated on the pot. Talking to them about their lives in the past year, they said: Now we can't finish the supplies, the vegetables are grown by ourselves, and we can sell what we can't eat. Each company has its own production, and the money earned is enough for salt and plenty of oil, and the accounts are completely open. This year, during the Mid-Autumn Festival, there were vegetable funds, holiday allowances, production dividends, and things to comfort the masses, with an average of three catties of meat, one chicken, and ten eggs per person... At this time, they loudly complained about Chiang Kai-shek and the old society he ruled.
    There were no guards in front of Division Commander Tian Shuqing's door. He said, "This is very necessary. By abolishing the guards, commanders, soldiers, local cadres, and folks can casually run to you to discuss things, and you can get closer to the masses more easily." In fact, Division Commander Tian understood the local people's views on the troops more clearly than anyone else. At Commander Shang Zhongxia's place, without someone introducing him, one would hardly know that he was the division commander, as he wore the same cotton military uniform as the soldiers. I walked to Division Commander Chen Mingshao's division headquarters, and he was convening a meeting of platoon leaders who had returned from training in the division cadre training class, soliciting the platoon leaders' opinions on the leadership and understanding the problems of the troops. The platoon leaders said to the division commander: "The patients in the hospital sometimes eat less wheat than the companies, please pay more attention to taking care of the patients." The division commander said: "I will send someone to check immediately."
    An important principle of governing the army in the old army was "soldiers will not be diligent if they are not beaten, and generals will not be brave if they are not killed." In fact, many officers and soldiers told me: "That way, you can't be 'diligent' or 'brave'." A group of soldiers in Company × said: "In the past, we only hoped that the officers would get sick, so they couldn't beat us." What about now? When a platoon leader got sick, the soldiers took out 4,000 yuan from their production dividends to help him get well quickly so that he could lead their studies.

    民主建国军访问归来（上）
    苏棣
    在民主建国军访问许多士兵、官长和将军，观察了他们的工作和生活，我发现在这个部队中有许多事物正在新陈代谢，一种由旧军队走上“人民武力”的新生命正在飞跃的生长。
      ×      ×      ×      ×
    我们访问一师一团的时候，各连正在分头上课。士兵们穿着新棉衣，坐在自己编制的草垫上。课堂是个露天广场，场房的墙上挂着各连的壁报，那些字迹大小不一的文章真朴的流露着士兵们的情感和喜恶。×连的壁报有三十七篇文章，十二篇纪念邯郸起义，七篇描叙自己的幸福生活，其余都是咒骂蒋介石和美国的。一个战士刘得雨画了一个古装的将军，写道：“我反对岳飞的愚忠，拥护毛主席为人民。”他开始把新旧伟人的界线划开了，因此他十分“感谢高树勋将军领导自己邯郸举义。”
    四团的驻地整齐清洁，西北军这一优良传统，他们牢固的继承了。每个班的墙壁上都挂着士兵的习字本，还贴着士兵自己所选出的经济委员会结算的菜金账目。习字本把“习字”和“日记”结合在一起，自己每天的学习心得、生活大事、对战友们和官长们的意见，都详细记在本子上。官长们修改的时候，就可吸收这些意见，了解部队的情况。某连的干部战士过去多不识字，一年来文盲差不多消灭了，最多的已识到八百字。提高文化，这是士兵们满意今天的许多原因之一。
    在四师的一个小单位里，看见士兵们正在吃饭。白面条中搀着青菠菜，锅上浮着一层厚厚的油。和他们谈起一年来生活，他们说：现在给养吃不完，菜是自己种的，吃不完还可以卖。各连自己有生产，赚了钱，盐是尽吃，油也不少，账目完全公开。今年过中秋有菜金、过节费、生产红利及群众慰劳的东西，每个人平均三斤肉、一只鸡、十个鸡蛋……这时候，他们大声的埋怨蒋介石和他统治的旧社会。
    田树青师长的门前没有卫兵守卫，他说：“这是很必要的。把卫兵撤消，部队的指挥员、战士、地方干部和老乡，能随随便便的跑到你那里商量一些事情，你能更容易的接近群众。”事实也是如此，田师长了解地方上对部队的观感，比任何人都要清楚。在商中夏师长那里，不是有人介绍，简直不会知道他是师长，他穿着和士兵们同样的棉军服。我走到陈明韶师长的师部，他正召集从师干训班受训回家的班长们开会，征求班长们对领导上的意见，了解部队的问题。班长们向师长说：“医院里的病号吃的麦子有时比连上少，请师长多注意照顾病号。”师长说：“我马上派人去检查。”
    旧军队有一条重要的治军原则，叫作“兵不打不勤，将不杀不勇。”其实，许多官长和士兵告诉我：“那样作既不能‘勤’，又不能‘勇’。”×连一群士兵说：“过去净盼着当官的生病，他病了就不能打我们了。”现在呢？他们一个排长病了，士兵们从自己的生产红利中抽出四千元，让他赶快治好病，领导自己的学习。
