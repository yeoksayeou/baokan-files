Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th: Nanjing dispatch: Chiang Kai-shek's personally orchestrated "National Assembly" opened at 10:00 AM on the 15th in Nanjing. The designated number of "National Assembly representatives" was 2,050, with 1,420 registered and only 1,350 attending. Besides the Kuomintang, only a "countable few seats" of the "Youth Party affiliated with the Kuomintang" (according to the Associated Press) participated, while the CCP and other democratic parties, who truly represent the Chinese people, refused to attend. As the curtain rose, Wu Zhihui, designated by Chiang Kai-shek as the chairman of the assembly, led all the "representatives" in a "swearing-in" ceremony and delivered an opening speech. Then, Chiang Kai-shek took to the stage, delivering a long, cliché-ridden, and utterly disgusting "Chiang's eight-legged essay," venomously attacking so-called "armed political parties," and proposing to use the so-called "Revised Draft of the May 5th Constitution," which violated the principles of the Political Consultative Conference and was not agreed upon, as the basis for this "National Assembly" to formulate a "perfect and feasible constitution." After the speech, the "ceremony" was declared complete amidst deafening music.

    南京非法国大开幕
    蒋介石粉墨登场致词臭不可耐
    【新华社延安十六日电】南京讯：蒋介石一手包办的“国民大会”于十五日上午十时在南京开幕，“国大代表”额定人数为二千零五十名，报到者一千四百二十人，出席者仅一千三百五十人，除国民党外，仅有“可数的几席”“附属于国民党的青年党”（合众社语）参加，而真正代表中国人民的中共及其他民主党派均拒绝出席。幕启，首由蒋介石指定的大会主席吴稚晖率领全体“代表”举行“宣誓”，并致开幕词后，蒋介石即粉墨登场，向众致辞，发表了一大篇陈腔烂调臭不可耐的“蒋八股”，并杀气腾腾的对于所谓“武装政党”放一毒箭，并提出将以违反政协原则未经协议的所谓“五五宪草修正案”作为此次“国大”制订“完善可行的宪法之基础”。词毕，在噪耳的乐声中宣布“礼成”。
