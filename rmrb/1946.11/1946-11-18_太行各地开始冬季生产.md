    Winter Production Begins in Various Parts of Taihang
    Licheng Organizes Transportation Teams
    Yushe Vigorously Develops Textile Industry
    Wuxiang Establishes Saltpeter Boilers
    Zuoquan Establishes Credit Cooperatives
    [This newspaper's Changzhi, 14th dispatch] Winter production has already begun in various parts of Taihang. Farmers in Licheng and other places immediately organized transportation teams to go east to Wu'an, Xingtai, and other places as soon as the autumn harvest ended. The Beiliu Cooperative, based on the conditions of abundant mountain products and scarce firewood in the village, specially set up a freight station in Weizi Town, Lucheng, organized transportation teams to transport mountain products outwards and coal inwards. At the end of last month, Yushe convened a joint meeting of district heads from various districts to arrange winter production. It was required that sideline production in winter should compensate for the poor harvest caused by wind and frost this year. It is planned that at least 17,000 men and 8,800 women will participate in winter production out of the county's population of 60,000. The specific methods of the county are: (1) The county government will issue loans of 5.4 million to support textile industry, various workshops, and small cooperatives. Each of the 24 joint defense units in the county will buy a hand-pulled shuttle loom to promote weaving technology, set up four coal stations, and organize coal transportation. (2) County, district, and village will establish winter production committees, paying attention to developing small cooperative movements. Winter production activities have also begun for farmers in Pingshun. The first district of the county plans to organize 2,400 laborers and 700 livestock to engage in transportation, and 2,700 women to engage in regular weaving, each weaving eleven or twelve catties of cotton, with an estimated income of 10 million yuan. The plan for one district in Wuxiang is to organize 70% of women to engage in regular weaving, develop 40 small cooperatives, and establish six saltpeter boilers. The saltpeter boilers have now started production. In order to prepare for next year's great production movement, Lao Ying Li Mabao of Shuxin Village, in the county, led the masses to produce more than 14,000 dan of fertilizer immediately after the autumn harvest. In order to absorb the idle funds of the masses and invest them in winter production, the Zuoquan Matian Town Cooperative specially established a credit cooperative and added a credit department.
