    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, November 11th: Paris dispatch: Yesterday (the 10th), France held elections to determine the composition of the new National Assembly of the Fourth Republic. This new assembly will lead France for the next five years. Six hundred and nineteen members will be elected from among three thousand two hundred candidates. According to unofficial estimates as of 20:00 (Greenwich Mean Time) on the 10th, out of the first 100,000 votes, the Communist Party took the lead with 30 percent, the Popular Republican Movement was second with 24.3 percent, the Socialist Party was third with 18 percent, the Conservative Party was fourth with 17.6 percent, and the Radical Party was fifth with 9.6 percent. Parisians began going to the polls at 8:00 AM on the 10th. This is the first official republican election since 1936. In the past thirteen months, the French people have gone to the polls six times, electing a provisional constituent assembly and ratifying a new constitution. The total number of registered voters is 25 million. It is expected that 75 percent of them will actually participate in the voting. The fate of Premier and Foreign Minister Bidault depends on this election. Last week, he stated that unless his party, the Popular Republican Movement, wins a majority in the election, he will not participate in the foreign ministers' conference in New York. Polling stations closed at 6:00 PM on the 10th, and the official election results, excluding the colonies, will be announced on Monday morning.
