　　[This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch] The Taihang counties are now successively convening heroes' congresses. Participants are mainly labor heroes selected from districts and villages, as well as various agricultural and industrial production experts, production organizers and leaders, militia combat heroes and war support models, model village cadres and emancipated heroes. Simultaneously, exhibitions are held focusing on production achievements to review the overall gains of production, mass movement and other works over the past year. Various heroes and models are selected to attend the Taihang Regional Heroes Congress that will soon open. According to existing materials, the Zanhang and Pingding counties' heroes congresses opened earliest on the 25th of last month. Those that have closed or are currently in session include Shouyang, Lincheng, Lingchuan, Jingxing, Xiyang, Heshun, Neiqiu, Pingshun, Wuxiang, Zuoquan, Yushe, Lucheng, Xiangyuan, Licheng, Wu'an, Shexian and other eighteen counties. The number of heroes and models participating in the congresses in each county ranges from more than three hundred to at least one hundred. Old heroes who attended the 1944 Regional Heroes Congress, such as Li Shunda from Pingshun, Shi Cunjin from Licheng, Li Mabao from Wuxiang, and Hou Hexiao from Zanhuang, were mostly re-elected by the masses as heroes this time. New labor heroes and production models account for about one-third to one-half, demonstrating new progress in production. The increased number of textile and various sideline business heroes further illustrates that women's textile work and rural sideline businesses in this region have developed significantly compared to the previous year. The main content of the meetings is to summarize the county's production and share heroes' experiences. The production summaries of each county indicate that the scale and achievements of this year's production have exceeded those of last year. Licheng, Pingshun, Xingtai old areas and other counties have achieved a county-wide "cultivate three and spare one" standard this year. Wuxiang's statistics show that all thirty-nine labor heroes attending the meeting have achieved "cultivate three and spare one", with six people reaching "cultivate one and spare one" and fourteen people reaching "cultivate two and spare one". The county's old hero Li Mabao has even reached "cultivate one and spare two". The summaries of each county also show that the promotion of special crops, improved varieties, and sideline production has been very successful this year. For example, Xiyang planted more than 15,000 mu of Golden Queen corn and more than 4,000 mu of cotton (which was completely uncultivated in the past). The number of livestock in the county has increased by more than 800 head, pigs have increased by more than 1,900 (in 1942, the Xixi area only had one pig under the destruction of the enemy and puppets), sheep have increased by more than 4,000, and chickens have reached the level of one per person. The number of women engaged in textile work has increased from only 8,000 last year to 24,000 this year, an increase of two times. Lingchuan has changed the idea that "spinning and weaving are the business of the people of northern Henan" and most villages have achieved self-sufficiency in clothing through men farming and women weaving. Each county has formulated plans for the winter mass movement, winter production, self-defense guerrilla warfare, and support for the front lines at this meeting. According to statistics from eighteen counties, more than 3,000 various heroes and models participated in the county heroes congresses, a significant increase compared to the previous few years. Furthermore, the county heroes congresses also held discussions on the current situation. The heroes expressed infinite indignation at Chiang Kai-shek's offensive. They are also keenly aware of the US imperialist support for Chiang's civil war and Chiang Kai-shek's convening of his so-called "National Assembly" to persist in the civil war dictatorship. They vowed to unleash even greater heroic enthusiasm to engage in struggles on all fronts, especially the self-defense front, to respond to the US-Chiang reactionaries.
