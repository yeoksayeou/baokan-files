　　"Drive out the Red-Haired Robbers!"
　　Yangcheng Streets During "U.S. Troops Out of China" Movement Week

　　The first day of the "U.S. Troops Out of China" movement week saw the streets and alleys of Yangcheng buzzing with excitement, the city as filled with boiling strength as the people. The people, having become masters for the second time, wanted to "invite" the red-haired robbers out. The first time, they had driven Japanese imperialists from Chinese soil. Three hundred and eighty-two wall slogans, plastered all over the city, represented the people's cry: "U.S. Troops Out of China!" The usually favored West Pond, a tranquil place for leisure, saw a sudden decrease in visitors, as everyone headed to the noisy, bustling city center. Particularly crowded were the areas on either side of the Martyrs' Cemetery, where more than a dozen cartoons were displayed. One peasant woman pointed to a cartoon depicting a U.S. imperialist riding a dog with Chiang's head and asked, "Why does Chiang Kai-shek have a tail?" A girl replied, "This tail is still small; when it gets bigger and wags back and forth, his godfather will be able to see it." The people around them laughed, and she laughed too.

　　The first day of this movement was met with an air raid by Chiang's planes. As soon as the all-clear sounded, people immediately returned to the city, and the elementary school's costumed propaganda continued with great fanfare. The result of the teachers and students of seven schools publicizing Chiang Kai-shek's treasonous crimes has increased the people's indignation. A reporter spoke with an old Eighth Route Army soldier from a wounded soldiers' recuperation center on the street. His name was Zhang Liancheng, from Nanyang Prefecture, Henan Province. He was wounded in the leg by a stray bullet during a self-defense battle that annihilated a regiment of Yan's army in Jiwang Mountain and came to the rear for recuperation. He said, "China's peace can only be achieved by defeating Chiang Kai-shek's offensive. I want to return to the front lines as soon as possible, and our comrades think the same way." Among the millions participating in the movement to demand the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China, I saw this most determined and practical hero, who seemed to have forgotten that his injury had not yet healed. Another person interviewed, Mr. Yang Benyuan, who had worked in Chiang Yan's army, recently resigned from his position as chief of staff and came to the liberated area. He said, "We are now 'inviting' the U.S. troops stationed in China to leave and not help Chiang Kai-shek's civil war. If the United States doesn't know what's good for it, it will definitely run into a wall. The people of the liberated areas were able to defeat the powerful Japanese imperialists, and they have the power to drive out the U.S. troops." The managerial meeting of the city's public-owned stores opened on the day of the worker-peasant-merchant movement, discussing how to mobilize to support the front lines. After the manager of Jinji Store brought the meeting's decision back to the shop assistants, it received unanimous support. The street government posted a list of stores providing manpower support to the front lines on the 27th, and all ten able-bodied workers from the store were listed on it. Public-owned stores, in particular, regarded this as an honor. They were mobilizing directly for the patriotic self-defense war for the first time. On the last day of the movement, when a mass rally was held, Yangcheng Street seemed even narrower, with everyone turning out and traffic becoming impossible. The most eye-catching thing was a "paper tiger" behind the South Gate Village band. This reminded me of a cartoon I saw the day before yesterday at a certain East entrance, in which U.S. imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek stood behind the fallen bodies of Japanese imperialists and Wang Jingwei, painted in vivid colors. This "paper tiger" symbolizes that whether it is U.S. imperialism or Chiang Kai-shek, they are destined to perish in the face of the people's power.

### “把红毛强盗赶出去！”  美军退出中国运动周的阳城街头

　　“把红毛强盗赶出去！”
    美军退出中国运动周的阳城街头
    驱逐美军运动周的第一天，阳城的大街小巷就在激动着，城市和人民一样充满沸腾的力量。人们第二次主人资格，要把红毛强盗“请”出去。第一次人们已把日本帝国主义者驱逐中国的土地。三百八十二条墙头标语，布满全城，代表着人民的一个呼声：“驱逐美军出中国！”为人们最喜欢的西池，这座消闲的静地，游人顿见减少，都走到噪杂闹市中来。特别在烈士陵园的两侧，聚拢的人最多，那里贴着十数幅漫画，一个乡下老婆指着一幅美帝国主义者骑着蒋首狗身的画说：“怎么蒋介石长着尾巴？”回答的是一个姑娘：“这尾巴还小，大一点，摆来摆去，他干爸爸才能看得见”，周围的人笑了，连她也笑了。
    这次运动的第一天就遭到蒋家飞机的空袭，解除警报一响，人们立刻回到城里来，小学校的化装宣传依旧闹得锣鼓喧天。七处学校的全体师生宣传蒋介石卖国罪恶的结果，已增长了人民的激愤。记者在街头曾与一位伤兵疗养院的八路军老战士谈话，他叫张连城，河南南阳府人氏，在稷王山消灭了阎军一个团的自卫战斗中，腿部为流弹所伤来到后方休养的，他说：“中国的和平要打败蒋介石的进攻才能得到。我愿很快回到前线去，我们的同伴也是这样想。”在要求美军退出中国运动参加的千万人中，我看到这位最坚决实干的英雄，他似乎忘记了自己的伤并未好哩。被访问的另一位杨本源先生，曾在蒋阎部队里混过事的人，是不久前辞去参谋主任的职务来到解放区的。他说：“我们现在是‘请’驻在中国的美军出去，不要帮助蒋介石内战。美国要不知好歹，就一定碰壁。解放区的人民能打倒强大的日本帝国主义，就有力量把美军赶出去。”该城公营商店的经理会议，在农工商运动日开幕，讨论如何动员起来支援前线，晋记商店经理将会议决定带回讲给店员之后，得到一致拥护。街公所的墙上二十七日公布各商店人力支援前线的名单中，该商店十个全劳力都列在上面。特别是公营商店，认为这是一种光荣。他们第一次直接地为爱国自卫战争而动员起来。运动的最后一天，举行群众大会时，阳城街更显得窄狭了，万人空巷，拥挤不通。最惹人注目的是南关村乐队后的一只“纸老虎”。这使我回忆及前天在某处东口看到的一幅漫画，美帝国主义者与蒋介石立着背后有倒下去的两具色彩鲜明的日本帝国主义者和汪精卫的尸体，这个“纸老虎”正象征着不论是美帝国主义，抑是蒋介石，在人民力量的面前，终究是要灭亡的。
