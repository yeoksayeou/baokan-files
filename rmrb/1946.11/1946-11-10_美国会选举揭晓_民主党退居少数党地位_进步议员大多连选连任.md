Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th: Reports from various sources indicate that the results of the US Congressional and gubernatorial elections have been announced. The Republican Party secured 244 seats in the House of Representatives (previously 190), while the Democratic Party won 190 seats (previously 242). In the Senate, the Republican Party gained 51 seats (previously 40), and the Democratic Party obtained 45 seats (previously 56). In the gubernatorial races, the Republican Party secured 25 governorships (previously 23), and the Democratic Party won 23 (previously 25). Since Roosevelt's presidency in 1933, the Democratic Party has been the majority party, reaching its peak strength in Congress in 1936. However, it has been weakening ever since, leading to its current relegation to minority status. Although the Republican Party holds the majority in this election, many progressive congressmen were reelected. For example, Sabath, the founder of the Congressional Committee for Peace (who opposed the US authorities' aid to Chiang Kai-shek's civil war), was elected as a Representative for the twentieth time. Of the 31 isolationists, 18 had already been defeated in the primaries this summer.

　　美国会选举揭晓
    民主党退居少数党地位
    进步议员大多连选连任
    【新华社延安七日电】各方报导：美国国会议员及州长选举结果业已揭晓，共和党获得众院之二四四席（原为一九○席），民主党一九○席（原为二四二席）。参院中共和党得五十一席（原为四○席），民主党得四十五席（原为五十六席）。州长中共和党获得二十五席（原为二十三席），民主党二十三席（原为二十五席）。按民主党自一九三三年罗斯福当政以还即为多数党，于一九三六年在国会中力量最为雄厚，但此后则日益削弱，以至于此次退居少数。此次选举中，共和党虽占多数，但许多进步议员仍获得连任。如国会争取和平委员会发起人萨巴兹（他曾反对美当局援蒋内战）即第二十次当选为众议员，而三十一名孤立分子中有十八名早已在今夏预选中落选。
