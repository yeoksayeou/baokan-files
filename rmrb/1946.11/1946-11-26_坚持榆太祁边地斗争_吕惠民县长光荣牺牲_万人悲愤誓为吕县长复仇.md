　　【Report from Changzhi, this paper】Persist in the Struggle on the Border Area of Yu, Tai, and Qi:
    County Chief Lü Huimin Sacrifices Honorably:
    Ten Thousand People Grieve and Vow to Avenge County Chief Lü:
    The joint Yu-Tai-Qi county (located on the Tongpu Railway in the central Shanxi plain, consisting of the western areas of Yuci, Taigu, and Qi counties along the Tongpu Railway, as well as a few towns in Yangqu) government was surrounded by more than 600 Yan troops on the 4th of this month in Nanzhuang Village, west of Yuci. County Chief Lü Huimin was unfortunately captured during the self-defense battle, but Lü remained steadfast and unyielding and was immediately murdered, sacrificing honorably.
    Lü was a leader deeply loved by the 130,000 people of the area, a leader who shared their hardships. When the tragic news spread, all the people shed tears. Lü was in his thirties, a native of Yuci, from a poor peasant background, and an excellent member of the Chinese Communist Party. After Yuci was invaded by Japanese invaders in 1937, he resolutely put down his hoe and joined the War of Resistance. He joined the Party in 1938 and, under the leadership of the Party, persisted in the local anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare for eight full years. At that time, Yu and Tai had fallen, and the stubborn government had fled far away. The local people established the Yu-Tai Joint Office and elected Lü as the director. During those eight years, he fought the enemy and puppets, risking his life and never leaving the local people. In 1941 and 1942, the Japanese invaders in North China implemented "security enhancement," and the mopping-up operations were frequent, and the environment was extremely difficult. Lü led his government personnel and guerrillas to disperse and subsist in the open, persisting in the fight. The difficulty and danger were beyond description. Before and after the counter-offensive, the guerrilla force expanded to three or four hundred people, and government orders could reach 80% of the villages in the area. In April of this year, the county held its first post-war general election and established a county council and a popularly elected government. Lü was elected as the first popularly elected county chief. Since May, the Yan puppets have launched frantic offensives in the area, carrying out mopping-up operations, burning, and killing, surpassing even the Japanese invaders, causing the local people to once again be plunged into a sea of ​​fire. Fortunately, under the active leadership of County Chief Lü and the County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the positions could be maintained. This time, County Chief Lü's unfortunate sacrifice has aroused the grief and indignation of ten thousand people, who have resolutely expressed their determination to fight the Yan puppets to the end and avenge County Chief Lü.

　　坚持榆太祁边地斗争
    吕惠民县长光荣牺牲
    万人悲愤誓为吕县长复仇
    【本报长治讯】榆太祁联合县（位于同蒲路晋中平原为榆次、太谷、祁县同蒲路西地区与阳曲少数村镇联合而成）县政府于本月四日在榆次路西之南庄村遭阎军六百余人包围，县长吕惠民在自卫战斗中不幸被俘，但吕坚贞不屈，当即遇害，光荣牺牲。
    吕氏为该地十三万人民衷心爱戴的患难领袖。噩耗传出，人民无不落泪。吕氏现年三十余，榆次人，贫农出身，为中共优秀党员。民国二十六年日寇侵陷榆次后，即毅然放下锄头，参加抗战。二七年入党，在党的领导下坚持该地抗日游击战争整整八年，当时榆太失陷，顽政府远逃，当地人民成立榆太联合办事处选吕为主任。八年间与敌伪搏斗，出死入生，从未离开该地人民。民国三十、三一年，华北日寇实施“治安强化”，清剿扫荡频繁，环境极为艰苦，吕氏率其政府人员与游击队，化整为零野餐露宿坚持战斗。其困难危险非笔墨所能描述。反攻前后，游击队扩大至三四百人，政令能达该地百分之八十的村庄。今年四月，该县进行战后第一次普选，成立县议会，民选政府，吕氏即当选为第一任民选县长。五月以来阎伪即疯狂进攻该地清剿烧杀赛过日寇，使当地人民重蹈火海，幸有吕县长及中共县委的积极领导，使阵地得以坚持。此次吕县长不幸牺牲，引起万人悲愤，均坚决表示要与阎伪搏斗到底，为吕县长复仇。
