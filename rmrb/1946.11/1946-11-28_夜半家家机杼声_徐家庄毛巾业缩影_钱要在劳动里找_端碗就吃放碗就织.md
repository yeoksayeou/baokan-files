From afar, Xujiazhuang looks like a large flower garden. The snow-white, red-centered, green-edged objects are actually towels drying by the village. Stepping into the village, merchants bustle through the streets, and many snack stalls line the roadside. Villagers in brand-new cotton clothes are all smiles; groups of children run, jump, and sing:
	“Towel looms, clatter-clatter.
	White towels, like snowflakes.
	Weaving dozen after dozen.
	Towel looms clatter loudly,
	Money trees jingle-jangle.
	It's the treasure for getting rich,
	It's a big silver pot.”

This village of over three hundred households, after land reform and with the help of the government, has grown from seven looms hidden away two years ago to the current two hundred and seventy, with over a thousand people participating in production. People are becoming wealthy from weaving towels. Tian Licai, a family of a soldier resisting Japan, was originally very poor. He obtained land during land reform and used the fruits to buy two looms. Last year, he earned 100,000 yuan from the looms, and this year he has already earned 100,000 yuan. He now has thirty mu of good land and has also purchased a large ox and production tools, rising to become a new type of rich peasant. Xu Zhenwen, a family of a soldier resisting Japan, was a bankrupt landlord before the war, who never "lifted a fallen straw or picked up an upright one," so the family was not harmonious. Last year, his family bought a towel loom, and the whole family participated in labor, and this year they have also become prosperous. Xu Zhenwen now feeds the cattle, carries water, buys thread, and sells towels every day, completely changing his past idle, parasitic lifestyle. He proudly told the reporter, "Wealth must be found through labor!" His family of three bought thirty or forty mu of land, and they eat white flour every day. The bankrupt landlord has risen again to become a rich peasant. Although Xu Yuzhang had a towel loom during the period of Japanese occupation, the village "ran out of cotton" every year at that time. The Japanese invaders took all the cotton away, and his loom had to be silent like a dead machine. After the liberation of Wei County, his loom was revived. He obtained fruits in the mass movement, had capital, and bought a new loom. Relying on these two looms, he earned 200,000 yuan last year and 150,000 yuan this year. His family already has thirty mu of good land, built a new house, and has also risen to become a new type of rich peasant. In total, due to the development of the towel industry, over a hundred of the three hundred and forty households in the village have risen from being extremely poor or poor peasants to middle peasants. Twenty families have risen from middle peasants to rich peasants.

Late at night, the sound of the looms is even louder. I was so excited that I couldn't sleep and went to Xu Zhencai's house with a friend. As soon as we entered the courtyard, we heard the sound of looms mixed with a clear singing voice. It turned out that his daughter was working happily and singing. Her mother pointed to the loom and said, "We eat from it, we wear from it. Last year we earned 150,000 yuan, and this year we have earned 70,000 yuan! Our loom eats when we pick up the bowl, and weaves when we put down the bowl; it is very capable!" Xu Zhencai is over seventy years old. In the past, he would gamble whenever he had free time, but now it is different. He uses his old hands and feet to bleach towels, insert tassels, and go to the market to trade every day. Seeing his wife praising his daughter, he also said, "Look, who can still say that men are money stacks and women are money-losing goods?" When we said goodbye, he earnestly said, "Work, work. People cannot live if they do not work." Xujiazhuang has gone from poverty to wealth, and every family is well-fed and well-clothed. The masses are very clear that this is the good life they have under the leadership of the Communist Party and the democratic government. When they heard that Chiang Kai-shek was attacking the liberated areas, they personally sent ten of their children to the front line and enthusiastically donated 900,000 yuan to the front.

### 夜半家家机杼声  徐家庄毛巾业缩影  钱要在劳动里找  端碗就吃放碗就织

　　夜半家家机杼声
    徐家庄毛巾业缩影
    钱要在劳动里找
    端碗就吃放碗就织
    远远望去，徐家庄像个大花圃。雪白的红心绿边，原来是晾在村边的毛巾。走进村子，街上来往着商人，路旁零食摊子很多。穿着崭新棉衣的村人满面笑容；三三俩俩的孩子们跑跳着，歌唱着：
    “毛巾机，哗啦啦。
    白毛巾，雪花花。
    织了一打又一打。
    毛巾机哗哗响，
    银钱树儿叮叮当。
    它是发家宝啦，
    它是个大银缸。”
    这三百多户的村庄，经过土地改革，加上政府的帮助，已从前年藏着的七架织机发展到目前的二百七十架，一千余人参加制作，人们都从织毛巾中致富了。抗属田立才家原先非常贫苦，土地改革中获得了土地，又用果实买了两架织机，去年靠机子赚了十万元，今年又已赚了十万元。现已有三十亩好地，还添购了一头大牛和生产工具，上升为新型富农。抗属徐振文家，事变前是个破产地主，整日“横草不拿、竖草不拾”，因此家里也不和睦。去年他家买了架毛巾机，全家都参加劳动，今年也发了家。徐振文现在每天喂牛、担水、买线子、卖毛巾，完全改变了过去游手好闲的寄生生活。他得意的告诉记者说：“钱要在劳动里找！”他家三口人，买了三四十亩地，每天吃饭不离白面。破产的地主又上升为富农。徐玉章在日寇时期虽有毛巾机，但那时村里年年“断白（棉花）”，日寇把棉花都拉走了，他的机子只得像死机一样无声无息。威县解放后，他的机子复活了。他在群运中得到果实，有了资本，又买了一架新织机。靠着这两架机，去年赚了二十万，今年又赚十五万。他家已有三十亩好地，盖起新房，也上升为新型富农。总计由于毛巾业的发展，全村三百四十户中由赤贫、贫农上升为中农的百余家。中农上升为富农的二十家。
    夜深了，机声响的更响亮了。我兴奋的不能睡眠，和朋友去到徐贞才家。一进院内，即听到机声中和着清脆的歌声，原来是他的姑娘正在快乐的工作着，歌唱着。她娘指着机子说：“俺吃着它，穿着它，去年赚了十五万，今年又赚七万啦！俺机子端碗就吃，放碗就织，可有本事哩！”徐贞才已七十余岁，往年是得空就要赌博的，如今不然了：他用他的老手脚天天漂毛巾，入穗子，上集买卖。他见妻子夸姑娘，便也说：“你看，谁还能说男子是银钱垛，女子是赔钱货呀？”我们告别时，他又恳切的说：“做活做活，人不做活就不能活。”徐家庄由贫到富，家家丰衣足食，群众很清楚，这是共产党民主政府领导下过起来的好光景。当他们听说蒋贼进攻解放区，就亲送自己十个子弟奔赴前线，并踊跃献给了前方九十万元。（新华社冀南分社）
