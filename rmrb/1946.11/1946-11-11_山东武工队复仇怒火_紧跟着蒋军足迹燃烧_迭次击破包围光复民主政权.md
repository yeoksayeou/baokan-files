Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 9th—The armed work team led by Shang Kedong, Director of the Public Security Bureau of the Zhangqiu Democratic County Government, has shaken the rule of Chiang Kai-shek's tyranny. The Chiang troops in the county had just posted a notice "Reward for the Capture of Shang Kedong," when it was torn down by the common people. In the past month, with the help of the local people, they have broken through two encirclements by Chiang's troops, and restored six democratic political powers in places such as Da Xiaokang Village, killing and wounding more than 100 Chiang soldiers. With the exception of the most hated traitors and running dogs such as Liu Xueheng and Li Daochuan, staff members of the democratic government can openly carry out activities everywhere. Many members of the armed work team haunt the vicinity of the Jiaoji Railway and the Zibo branch line. Among them, the Zibo district armed work team, from August 1st to the end of October, coordinated with local armed forces and militiamen to fight a total of 200 battles, killing and capturing more than 570 Chiang soldiers, and seizing 12 machine guns and American-style submachine guns, more than 150 rifles, and more than 8,000 rounds of ammunition. In Zichuan County alone, 70 bunkers were leveled. The Huantai armed work team and militiamen destroyed 30 Chiang's village public offices in 20 days, killing and capturing 40 Chiang soldiers, and seizing 2 American-style submachine guns and dozens of rifles. The fire of revenge burns closely following the footsteps of Chiang's troops. On the fourth day of Chiang's troops' invasion of Changyi, two landmines roared in front of the Chiang's county government, and two Chiang's officers and several attendants were immediately blown to pieces. The newly emerged Jiang Yixin Explosives Team haunts the area within two miles of the suburbs, killing 44 Chiang soldiers in two days, scaring Chiang's troops into blindly firing at the outside of the city. The people of Gaomi were shocked to hear that democratic figures in the urban area, such as Dr. Gao Fengnan, had been brutally killed by Chiang's troops, and were filled with indignation and are now closely searching for Chiang's secret agents. The Jimo armed work team won three battles out of three last month, capturing 34 Chiang's secret agents, and seizing 21 long and short guns, and more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition.

    【新华社山东九日电】章邱民主县政府公安局长尚克东率领的武工队，震撼了蒋家暴政的统治。该县蒋军刚贴出“悬赏通缉尚克东”的告示，即被老百姓撕掉。一月来，他们在当地人民帮助下，击破了蒋军两次包围，恢复了大小康庄等民主政权六处，毙伤蒋军百余人。除人民最痛恨的汉奸走狗刘学恒、李道传等外，民主政府工作人员到处都能公开活动，许多武工队员出没在胶济路和淄博支线的周围，其中淄博区的武工队，从八月一日到十月底，配合地方武装和民兵共作战二百次，毙俘蒋军五百七十余名，缴获机枪及美式冲锋机十二挺，步枪一百五十余支，子弹八千余发。仅在淄川一县，就平毁碉堡七十座。而桓台武工队和民兵，在二十天内即摧毁蒋记村公所三十处，毙俘蒋军四十名，缴获美式冲锋机二挺，步枪数十支。复仇的怒火紧跟着蒋军足迹燃烧。蒋军侵入昌邑的第四天，两颗地雷在蒋记县政府门前咆哮，蒋军军官两名及随从数名，立即粉身碎骨。新涌现的姜抑新爆炸队，出没在城郊二里内外的地带，两天内击毙蒋军四十四名，吓得蒋军向城外盲目扫射。高密人民惊闻城区民主人士高逢南医学博士等人惨遭蒋军杀害，愤慨万分，正严密搜捕蒋记特务。即墨武工队于上月中三战三捷，捕获蒋记特务三十四名，缴获长短枪二十一支，子弹千余发。
