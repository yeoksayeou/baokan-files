    【Changzhi News】To clear their minds and prepare for war, more than 100 village cadres from the Nandong district of Changzhi gathered to discuss the recent war situation and conduct ideological self-criticism. They discovered the following two types of thinking: One was underestimating the enemy and complacency, saying, "Aren't the troops blocking them in the front? They won't be able to come!" "The Central Army is useless, the Eighth Route Army's tactics are superior, they won't be able to come! Wasn't the Shangdang Campaign last year just like that?!" The other was fear and indecision; seeing Chiang's planes strafing and the city preparing for war, they felt anxious and uneasy. First, they feared that because they were cadres and militia, and had struggled against people in the past, the reactionaries would come, and the secret agents would report them, and they wouldn't be spared. Second, they feared that the masses would push the struggle onto them, and also feared that the middle peasants who hadn't received any fruits of the struggle would only care about themselves. Third, they feared that the cadres and activists would be disunited. Therefore, they felt bitter but dared not tell the masses, some thinking, "Anyway, I won't survive, I'll just let my wife and children run for their lives!" Others thought, "If they come, we'll just follow the Eighth Route Army and leave." The leadership, based on these thoughts, asked, "Is it because we struggled against the landlords that Chiang Kai-shek is selling out the country and attacking us to prevent us from living?" Everyone immediately reflected on the situation before and after the Japanese occupation, and said, "Before, we hadn't struggled against the 'Old Emperor' (the Emperor of Japan), but the 'Old Emperor' still killed many of us." "In the past, we hadn't struggled against Yan Xishan and the local despotic landlords, but they oppressed us and didn't let us live. This time we struggled against them, and now they call us 'Uncle' and 'Grandpa' when they see us."
    After deep reflection, comparison, and heated discussion, they further recognized the anti-people nature of Chiang Kai-shek and the possibility of him invading Lu'an with the support of American imperialism. They also strengthened their belief that leading the masses in struggle would lead to victory, and criticized the left-leaning and right-leaning ideas of complacency and fear. Then, everyone discussed many specific methods for leading the masses in preparing for war, launching guerrilla warfare, and countering spies and preventing treachery. They all said that after returning, they would properly communicate with the masses, ideologically, and actively prepare for war. (Changzhi County Joint Office)
    【Report from Cixian by this newspaper】The people of Cixian are all involved in intense war preparations. The militia are stepping up their military training, and the transport teams are busy transporting public grain and supplies. The militia of Pengcheng Township are practicing grenade throwing and aiming from early morning until late at night, for five or six days straight, and very few people have asked for leave or been absent.
    The villagers in each village are busy organizing stretcher teams and transport teams. An old man with a lame leg from Pengcheng's Nandazhi said, "Although I can't carry a stretcher, I can still deliver messages, and I want to do my part to defeat Old Chiang!" Zhang Sanniu, a hired laborer from Xinhua Street, pointed to his newly distributed three-room building and said, "I've been a hired laborer for half my life, and I haven't built a single house. Now that I have a house to live in, Chiang Kai-shek wants to attack us again, I have to fight him. If the village government needs me, I'll be there day or night." (Wang Zhou Nan)

    检查思想准备战争
    彭城民兵整日练习投弹瞄准
    【长治讯】为清醒头脑准备战争，长治南董小区百余村干部集会，讨论日前战局并作思想检查。发现以下两种思想：一种是轻敌麻痹，说：“前边队伍还不堵挡？来不了！”“中央军不顶事，八路军战术高，来不了！去年上党战役不就是个样？！”另一种是害怕，无主意；看到蒋机扫射，城里备战，心里就惶惶不安，一怕自己是干部、民兵，过去斗过人家，反动派来了，特务报告，饶不了自己。二怕群众把斗争推到自己身上，还怕没分过果实的中农各顾各。三怕干部、积极分子不团结。因而心里苦闷却又不敢告诉群众，有的想：“反正活不成，不管老婆、孩子各顾各跑吧！”有的想：“他来了，咱就跟上八路军走”，领导上根据这些思想提出“是不是因为斗争了地主，蒋介石才卖国进攻不叫咱活？”大家当即反省到日寇统治前后的情形，都说：“从前咱没斗过老皇，老皇也杀了咱好多人。”“过去咱没斗过阎锡山和村上的恶霸地主，可是他们却压迫咱，不叫咱活，这回斗争了他们，见到咱反倒叫起叔叔大爷来了。”
    经过深刻的反省对比和热烈的讨论后，进一步认识了蒋介石反人民的本质，及其在美帝国主义支持下侵犯潞安的可能性，并坚定了领导群众斗争就能胜利的信念，批判了麻痹和害怕的左、右倾思想。接着大家讨论了许多领导群众备战，展开游击战争和反特防奸的具体办法。都说回去后要好好打通群众思想，切实积极备战。（长治县联合办公室）
    【本报磁县讯】磁县人民都卷入紧张的备战工作中。民兵们加紧练武，运输队忙着在运送公粮物资。彭城镇的民兵，起早搭黑练习投弹瞄准，集中五六天了，很少有人请假或不到。
    各村的老乡们，都在忙着组织担架队运输队，彭城南大支一个拐了一条腿的老头说：“我虽然不能抬担架，我还能送信，打老蒋都有一份呀！”新华街雇工张三牛指着他新分得的三间楼房说：“我当了半辈子长工，一间房子也没有盖起，现在我有了屋子住，蒋介石又想进攻咱，我非和他干不行，村公所有事，白天叫我白天到，黑夜叫我黑夜到”。（王周南）
