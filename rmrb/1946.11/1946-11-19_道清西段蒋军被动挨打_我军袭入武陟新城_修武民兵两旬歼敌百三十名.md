    [This dispatch from Changzhi, 18th] On the night of the 11th, the main force of the Taihang Fourth Military Sub-district, having penetrated deep into the enemy's rear south of the Daqing Railway, launched a strong attack on Mulandian, the new county seat of Wuzhi. Our troops bravely scaled the city walls and stormed into the city, engaging in fierce street fighting with Zhao Choujiu's puppet security regiment and a part of the 49th Brigade of Jiang's army. The security regiment, the stubborn county government, and the public security bureau were all routed by our forces. By dawn, our troops, having completed their mission, withdrew from the city. In this battle, over a hundred Jiang's puppet troops and public security forces were killed or wounded, and more than 30 were captured, along with a light machine gun and more than 30 rifles. On the same night, another unit of our forces attacked the Xiaoleizhuang stronghold in Xiuwu, killing five soldiers from the 49th Brigade of Jiang's army and capturing four. On the night of the 12th, the entire puppet "Homecoming Corps" stationed at Beizhu stronghold on the Daqing line east of Jiaozuo was annihilated by our forces, killing over 30 and capturing over 30, with only a few escaping. All three pillboxes were flattened by our forces. On the night of the 13th, small armed units operating in the enemy's rear again attacked the Jiang's army strongholds of Hanzhuang and Beibei in Xiuwu County, killing and capturing one Jiang's soldier in each location and seizing one rifle. Due to insufficient troop strength, the 85th and 32nd Divisions of Jiang's army, which had invaded the western section of the Daqing Railway, were successively transferred away in late October and early November. The 49th Brigade, which was transferred in, is now trapped in Xiuwu and Wuzhi, while the 17th, 177th, and 55th Regiments of the 38th Division are trapped in a few strongholds along the Jiaozuo-Mengxian line. A small number of puppet security regiments and homecoming corps only dare to operate on the Daqing line and do not dare to venture out. In recent days, our local armed forces and militia work teams have continuously launched attacks, leaving Jiang's puppets passively beaten everywhere, and they are in a state of extreme panic. Local people reflect: "Look at the Central Army (中央军), they look so good, they can't even take the time to shit while they eat, and in the end, they still die!"
    [Special Dispatch] The Xiuwu County Command of the Taihang District announced the county's militia's self-defense battle results for twenty days (October 15th to November 5th), stating: "In the face of Chiang Kai-shek's unreasonable offensive, the county's militia have all bravely taken up their guns and launched a widespread anti-Chiang and home-defending movement. In the past twenty days, they have killed or wounded 117 Jiang's puppet troops and special agent forces, captured more than ten alive, while we have only suffered nine casualties."
    [Dispatch from Changzhi, 18th] The local armed forces and militia of Huixian County have repeatedly achieved combat successes in combating the invasion of Jiang's puppet troops. According to the county command, in the ten days from the 16th to the 26th of last month, the local armed forces killed 31 stubborn troops, captured eight alive, and seized ten rifles. In addition to killing 22 stubborn troops and capturing two, the militia also burned down seven stubborn pillboxes, confiscated a traitor's "cooperative," eliminated six traitors, defended four important mountain tops, conducted nine deep penetrations into the enemy's rear, and protected the transportation of 650,000 catties of public grain by the masses, with no casualties on our side. Many combat heroes emerged during the battles, and many exemplary deeds were created.
