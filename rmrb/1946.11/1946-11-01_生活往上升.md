　　Life Moving Upward
    Gao Ergong

    Note: Mr. Gao Ergong, a reporter for the Central News Agency, set out northward after Double Ten Festival last year, intending to cross the mountains and comfort the elders of his northeastern hometown, from whom he had been separated for fourteen years. Unfortunately, things did not go as planned. Unexpectedly, just as he crossed the Yellow River, Kuomintang warmongers single-handedly started the civil war. Yan's troops gathered on the Tongpu Railway, baring their fangs and claws to attack the people. Despite such a tense civil war situation, Mr. Gao was eager to return home and still broke through the smoke of gunfire and detoured forward. Unexpectedly, when he arrived in Hongdong, the Kuomintang person in charge of the county terrifyingly described to him the "savagery" of the people of Hongdong and Zhao, "how they raised their broadswords and hacked people to death alive..." This description by the Kuomintang officials aroused Mr. Gao's "grief and indignation." He immediately changed his plan, determined to "see what was actually happening," and resolutely entered our area on November 15th last year.

    As Mr. Gao said, "At the same time, I also decided on my attitude: to look calmly, to look repeatedly, not to lightly believe any word, and not to 'naively' impulsively praise or blame." Now, ten months have passed, and Mr. Gao has naturally seen many things, but in general, in Mr. Gao's own words: "After I came in, I was first happy to have broken away from that state of ignorance,... Especially in the past ten months, I have gained the greatest freedom of interviewing since I started working in journalism. I am happy to be able to personally examine every pulse beat on the limbs of China." "In order to observe carefully, I put away my pen for ten months. Now, I think I have the right to talk about the Liberated Areas to people outside the Liberated Areas."

    Mr. Gao's "Record of a Cell in the Liberated Area" originally consisted of more than ten thousand words, including "From the Central News Agency to the Liberated Area," "Little Village Anyang," "Life Moving Upward," "The Saints," "Voting with a Big Hemp Seed," "Villagers and Soldiers," and "Chen Xianshui Standing Beside Dayu," all of which vividly depict the democratic, free, and happy life of the peasants who have turned over. Due to space limitations, this newspaper cannot publish the entire original text, but only publish the two sections, "Life Moving Upward" and "Chen Xianshui Standing Beside Dayu," separately and successively to share with readers. We hope the author and readers will forgive us.

    The small village of Anyang in Lucheng, on the Shangdang Plain, has only 226 households, with a total population of 1,095 at the end of June. In terms of economic conditions, when the Eighth Route Army first liberated it, there were 15 landlord, landlord-operating, and rich peasant households, and 86 middle peasant households. The people living the most miserable lives were the poor peasants: most of them had no land to cultivate, and even if they had a little bit of land, it was not enough to cultivate. They used inferior labor tools, borrowed money from the landlords at "rolling donkey" interest rates, or sold their labor at low prices, living according to the landlords' faces. In this small village, there were as many as 125 poor peasant households, more than half of the total households.

    Since liberation, they have thrown off the heavy burden on their shoulders through the struggle against traitors and local bullies; they have cleared up the accounts of being defrauded by others during the enemy's rule through debt clearing; and they have carried out rent and interest reduction in accordance with government decrees. The village has been undergoing a thorough transformation. Afterwards, for the first time, they engaged in production for themselves without extortionate taxes and levies, and voluntarily organized mutual aid production groups. According to their experience, the mutual aid group method is good: three laborers can save one laborer. ... By the end of June, when I was about to leave this small village, except for less than 20 households that were poor peasants, all the other households who had originally lived as poor peasants had risen to the living standards of the middle peasant class.

    As for the middle peasants, let's take the Catholic Chen Chengzhe as an example. His family has four people. They used to cultivate 20 mu of land and were considered a middle-class household. Listen to his situation. He said to people, "In previous years, I had nothing to eat by March. After liberation and debt clearing, I got eleven dan of grain and bought nine mu of good land. Chairman Mao said that it is good to organize, so I joined the mutual aid group, and together with everyone, we bought a big mule. Just one trip to Handan earned us more than ten thousand yuan. Last time, I was allocated about twenty jin of salt, enough for me to eat all year round, and I was also allocated eight hundred yuan of Jicha..."

    On the fifteenth day of the first lunar month, when I had already arrived in the sixth district of Lucheng, I saw the masses of the entire district holding a mass rally of ten thousand people to express their gratitude to the Eighth Route Army. The peasants from various villages formed teams, some even sitting in large carts, moving forward in lines like ants moving their nests. Their village bands, the "Bayin Society," led the village's Yangko team and stilt team, blowing and beating their instruments, into the venue, with flags of various colors waving in waves.

    There were so many people attending that day that a high wooden platform was built in the center of the moving crowd, directly opposite the rostrum, as a speaker's platform. Only speaking from this central platform could be barely heard in every corner of the venue. After the representatives of the government and the army finished speaking, I saw a rural woman walking down from the rostrum through the crowded people. At this time, I realized that she was Chen Liunu, a female labor hero of Lucheng, and I also discovered that she was a woman with bound feet. However, she fearlessly climbed onto the high wooden platform, raised her hand, and spoke loudly. Then an old farmer with a white beard climbed up to speak. This was Zhang Lianshan, a hero of turning-over in the sixth district. He excitedly lifted the hem of his leather robe and showed it to everyone. The cold wind blew the clean white fur. He exerted all his strength to open his throat and shouted as if he wanted to speak to the whole world: "The Eighth Route Army and the Communist Party have come, and we have all turned over! I, Zhang Lianshan, have also turned over! Look! I have a fur coat to wear!"

    At that time, I was surprised that these "ignorant men and women" who had always been silent in labor today had the courage to shout to the masses, because I thought that anyone who was not a well-trained "orator" would be so frightened by the sea of people that they would forget all their speeches. Later, I went to Anyang Village, and in a longer life, I realized that it was the turning-over that gave every peasant a strong joy, and that power could motivate them to dare to do everything that they previously thought was absolutely impossible to do successfully. Yes, on that very day, women from many villages joyfully and automatically organized stilt teams. They were all women with bound feet who actually walked out of their homes and sang about their indescribable joy of turning-over while stepping on stilts.

    I remembered the famous saying of the French sociologist Fourier: "The degree of women's liberation is a sign of the degree of progress of a society."

    When I was once in the old Liberated Area of Qinshui County, from Mabi Village to Danglangbi Village, I hired an old man named Ma and a child to help me and my companions carry our luggage. When resting on the top of the mountain, the fifty-year-old man smoked his pipe and said that since the turning-over, he had participated in winter school to learn to read every year. When he heard the child say that his own learning was not formal enough, he earnestly advised: "You must study hard." He sighed, slowly nodding his head and said, "The current country (referring to the democratic government) really treats us like human beings. It's not okay if we don't work hard!" This sentence revealed what his own life had been like for the past few decades. From this sigh, I heard the truly happy sigh of the peasants after the turning-over truly felt the dignity of human beings. In the vast mountains of Taiyue, I heard the first truly joyful sigh of Chinese peasants.

　　生活往上升
    高尔公
    按：中央社记者高而公先生，于去年双十节后首途北行，意欲越过关山叩慰阔别十四年之东北故乡父老。惜事与愿违，不料刚一跨过黄河，国民党好战分子一手挑起了内战，同蒲线上阎军云集，张牙舞爪攻打人民。虽在如此紧张之内战风云下，高先生思乡心切，依然冲破硝烟绕道前行，想不到途及洪洞，该县国民党之负责人竟恐怖的给他描写了“洪赵人民的‘野性’，怎样的举起大刀活活把人砍死………………”，国民党官老爷们这一番的描述倒引起了高先生的“悲愤”，他顿即改变计划，抱定“且看究竟”的决心，于去年十一月十五日决然走入我区。
    正如先生所说：“同时我也决定了自己的态度：冷静的看；反复的看；不轻信任何一句话，不要‘天真’的冲动的赞美或是责备。”于兹十阅月了，高先生看到的事物自然很多，但总起来仍用高先生自己的话来说：“当我进来以后，我首先高兴自己脱离开那种愚昧状况，…………特别在十个月中，我得到了自我作新闻工作以来最大的采访自由，我高兴可以亲自来审查中国肢体上的每一下脉膊的跳动。”“我为了好好的观察，我把我的笔收起了十个月之久的时间。到现在，我想我有权利向解放区以外的人们说说解放区了”。
    高先生的《记解放区的一个细胞》，原文本来长达万余言，其中包括“从中央社到解放区”，“小村安阳”，“生活往上升”，“圣徒们”，“投一颗大麻子的选票”，“老乡们和兵”，“站在大禹身边的陈先水”等七节，都很新颖的写出了翻身农民的民主自由幸福生活。本报因篇幅所限，未能将原文全部刊出，仅将“生活往上升”，“站在大禹身边的陈先水”两节分别陆续发表以飨读者，希作者读者原谅。
                ——编者
    上党小平原上的潞城安阳小村才二百廿六户人家，人口总数在六月底统计是一千零九十五口人。按经济状况上说，在八路军刚解放时是地主、经营地主、富农共十五户，中农八十六户。而过着最悲惨生活的是贫农：大多数没有耕种的土地，即使有点巴子的地却又不够种，用的劳动工具是劣等的。借着老财们“驴打滚”的利钱，或者以低价出卖自己的劳动力，侍候着财主们的脸色过日子，在这小村子里贫农家竟有一百二十五户，超过全户一半以上。
    解放以来他们经过反汉奸、恶霸的斗争，肩上的千斤重担推下去了；经过清债把敌人统治时期自己被人讹诈的账目清理了；又按着政府法令进行了减租减息，村子里轰隆轰隆的在翻身了。以后第一次在没有苛捐杂税的条件下面为自己搞起生产，还自愿组织起生产互助组。根据他们的经验，那互助组办法就是不错：三工便可以省一工。…………到六月底我将离开这小村时，除了二十户以下的人家是贫农以外，其余原来过贫农生活的人家都已经上升到中农阶层的生活了。
    而中农呢，随便举一个天主教徒陈成则为例吧。他家有四人，以前种地二十亩，也算是一个中等户，听听他的光景吧，他对人说：“往年一到三月我就没吃的了，解放后清债，我得了十一石粮食，买了九亩好地。毛主席说组织起来好，我就参加了互助组，和大家又合买了一个大骡子，单往邯郸跑了一趟，就赚了一万多元钱，上次回来分约我二十斤盐，够我全年吃不完，还分了八百元钱冀钞………”
    旧历正月十五日，那时我已经到了潞城六区，在高家庄我见到了全区群众正在举行万人大会，向八路军表示他们的感谢诚意。各村农民结成队，有的还坐着大车，真像蚂蚁搬窠似的拉成线蠕动前进。他们各村的乐队“八音会”吹吹打打领导着本村的秧歌队、高跷队，进到会场了，各色的旗帜波波翻动着。
    那天到会的人实在太多了，主席台正对面，在蠕动的人海中心搭起一个高高的木台作为讲演台，只有在这中心台子发音才勉强可以被全场每个角落听见。政府和军队的代表说完话了，我看见一个乡村妇女从主席台上走下来经过拥挤的人群，这时我才知道她是潞城的女劳动英雄陈六女，同时我发现了她还是一个缠足的妇女，然而她毫无怯色的爬到高高的木台子上面去了，他举起了手，高声发音了。接着又一个苍老蓄有胡子的老农民爬上去讲话了，这是六区的翻身英雄张联山，他激动的揭起他的皮袍子的下襟，翻动给大家看，料峭的寒风吹动着那洁白的皮毛，他使足了劲拉开嗓门像要对全世界发音似的大声呼喊了：“八路军共产党来了，咱们都翻身了，我张联山也翻身了，看！我有了皮袄穿啦啊！”
    当时我对于这些一向在劳动中不吭声的“愚夫愚妇”今天有勇气对万众们高呼，这一点我是吃惊的，因为不是久经训练的“演说家”，我看是要被那人海吓得什么演词都忘了。其后我去安阳村，在较长生活中才认得了是翻身给了每个农民强烈的欢喜，那力量可以推动他们敢做一切从前认为绝对做不成功的工作。是的，就在那同一天，多少村的家庭妇女都欢欣的自动组织了高跷队，他们都是些缠足的家庭妇女居然也走出家门踩在高跷上唱着他们说不尽的翻身的欢喜。
    法国社会学家傅立叶的“妇女解放的程度是一个社会进步程度的标志”的名言，我又记起了。
    当我一次在沁水县老解放区里，从马壁村到当郎壁村时，我请了一位马老汉和一个小孩子帮我和同路的人担担行李。在山顶休息时，那五十岁的老汉抽着旱烟说他从翻身以来，年年参加冬学认字，当他听到那孩子说自己的学习还不够正规时，他便正色劝说：“一定要好好学习。”他叹了一声气，慢慢的点着头说：“现在的国家（指民主政府）真的可算把咱们当个人看了，不好好干那可不行哪！”这一句话写透了他自己过去几十年的生活是什么样的生活，从这一声叹息里我听到翻身后的农民真正感到了人的尊严。在太岳莽莽群山中我才是听到了第一声中国农民的真正愉快的叹息。
