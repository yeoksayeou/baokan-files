(This Dispatch from Yangcheng on the 4th) Gaoping recently summarized the problem of distributing the fruits of victory in the mass movement over the past six months. It had taken many detours, which greatly affected the movement before gradually finding a fair and reasonable method of filling gaps and making up deficiencies that was unanimously supported by the masses and best achieved the goal of "land to the tiller." The development process is as follows: First, distribution was based on participation in the struggle sessions and the degree of activeness. This method was mostly adopted at the beginning of the movement. For example, in Xiaoyechuan Village, cadres got the most, followed by activists, then members of the farmers' association, and the masses got nothing. As a result, the general masses were dissatisfied, and the farmers' association became detached from the masses. Although villages such as Dongzhai and Dazhou Cuan struggled against many local bullies and landlords, most of the masses, except for a few cadres, did not achieve liberation. Second, before June, most villages adopted the method of returning all the confiscated property to its original owners. The result was that some people were liberated, while others had no way to be. In ×× village, most of the rich peasants who had gone bankrupt due to providing funds to the enemy and puppets, actually ended up with more property after settling accounts with traitors than before the war, while another group of extremely poor peasants remained the same. Most poor peasants had fewer high-interest loan problems with landlords, and they did not receive any fruits of victory, which greatly reduced their enthusiasm for the struggle. Third, the fruits of rent reduction and debt settlement went to individuals, while the fruits of struggle against traitors and bullies were turned over to the public. As a result, some were not active in the struggle against traitors and bullies, while others were not active in rent reduction and debt settlement. Fourth, the fifth, sixth, and seventh districts turned over most of the fruits of victory to the community granary for the purpose of relieving the poor, providing preferential treatment to families of soldiers, and buying guns for the militia. Not only did the poor peasants not receive the fruits of victory, but it also created a situation where individual cadres took the opportunity to spend and waste money at will. Fifth, after the fruits of victory in Tuanchi Village were returned to their original owners, those with more land were allowed to lend some of it to poor peasants at a land price, with half interest. As a result, new debt relationships were formed. Sixth, the method of everyone achieving liberation by filling gaps and making up deficiencies was adopted. In the city and urban areas, distribution was based on needs, divided into five classes and ten grades, starting from the extremely poor and families of soldiers, with more than 70 percent of the total number of households receiving the fruits of victory. Shicun Village distributed most of the land and grain to tenant farmers, poor peasants, and families of soldiers, while middle peasants received clothing and furniture. Those who had received too much in the past voluntarily gave up some to those who had received less, in order to fill the gaps and make up for the deficiencies. The masses were very satisfied, believing that everyone should be liberated through struggle, and that this method was the fairest and most reasonable.

　　高平总结分果实经验
    走了半年弯路，证明按全体农民需要填平补齐最好。
    【本报阳城四日电】高平最近总结前半年群众运动中果实分配问题，曾走过不少弯路，使运动受了不少影响才逐渐找到了为群众一致拥护的、公平合理的，最能达到耕者有其田的填平补齐办法。其发展过程如下：第一、按参加斗争会与积极程度分配，此种办法在运动开始时多被采用。如小野川村干部多分，积极分子次之，农会会员再次之，群众不分。以致一般群众不满，农会脱离群众。东寨、大周篡等村虽斗争了不少恶霸、地主，但除少数干部外，多数群众均未翻身。第二、六月前，大部村庄采用清算所得各归原主办法，结果仍是部分人翻身部分人没法。××村大部因给敌伪出款而破产之富农，反奸清算后所得财产较战前还多，而另一部分赤贫农却依然如故。义安村一雇农从小出县给人放羊，灾荒年间，父母都饿死了，也没分到果实，还是一贫如洗。大部贫农与地主高利贷问题较少，亦未分得果实，致斗争情绪大为降低。第三、减租清债的果实归私人，反奸霸的果实归公，结果有的对反奸霸不积极，有的对减租清债不积极。第四、五、六、七区将大部果实归义仓，作救济贫苦、优抗及民兵买枪用，不仅贫苦农民未获得果实，反而造成个别干部趁机随便开支及浪费现象。第五、团池村斗争果实各归原主后，让地多的按地价贷给贫农一部分，并按分半行息，结果形成新的债务关系。第六、大家翻身，填平补齐办法，城内及城关按需要分配，分五等十级，从赤贫、军属往下推，分得果实户占总户数百分之七十以上。石村将土地、粮食大都分给佃农贫农及军属，中农则分衣物家具，过去分得过多的自动让出一部给少得的，进行填平补齐。群众都很满意，认为大家斗争应该大家都翻身，此种办法最为公平合理。
