Chen Xianshui Standing Beside Da Yu
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Gao Ergong

　　I was chatting with the villagers on the street when three unfamiliar, fully armed Eighth Route Army soldiers entered the village. The villagers greeted them warmly. These were soldiers from Anyang Village who had joined the resistance against Japan. Two of the soldiers carried guns with a rather unique design. When asked, I learned that these were American-made light machine guns "sent" by the Kuomintang army during their offensives. They had just come down from the East Qin line and their unit was resting in Lucheng County for three days, with orders that soldiers with families in the area could voluntarily return home to visit. "So we came back," they explained. After receiving the order, these soldiers freely dispersed to their warm homes, taking their weapons with them.

　　Although the villagers here had grown accustomed to seeing Eighth Route Army soldiers scattering in small groups to fight guerrilla warfare at a moment's notice, and then reassembling at designated times and places, it was still a great shock to me. I had been covering military service news at the Central News Agency headquarters, but I had never received a single news item similar to this situation. If soldiers in the Kuomintang army heard an order to scatter freely, the result—I don't need to elaborate, everyone in the Kuomintang area would answer this question correctly.

　　When I learned that one of the three was named Chen Xianshui, it piqued my interest because he was the son of Chen Erpang.

　　Chen Erpang was a large-scale landlord in the village, owning four livestock and employing three long-term workers to cultivate his seventy mu of land. He himself did not participate in the main labor. During the eight years of enemy occupation, he spent most of his time living in Lucheng city, constantly entangled in lawsuits with the weak in the village in the puppet regime's court. The villagers bitterly said, "Our money can't outlast theirs; we always lose the lawsuits." In this way, Chen Erpang prospered. He swaggered through the village, creating a gust of wind, and the villagers trembled at the sight of him. After liberation, the people stood up to settle the account with him for the eight years he shirked his burdens and duties and transferred them to the poor masses. After the accounts were settled, Chen Erpang's economic status collapsed. His acts of bullying and extortion were exposed in front of the masses in the village, and he thoroughly lost face. From then on, I personally witnessed Chen Erpang gradually weakening, speaking softly to the villagers and appearing gentle.

　　At this time, his son Chen Xianshui returned.

　　Chen Xianshui met with the head of the village government and expressed his attitude. I saw him as an honest man who wasn't very eloquent. He spoke plainly, but clearly, word by word:

　　"I know about my father's bullying in the village when the old Emperor (referring to the Japanese) was here, even more than you do. It's right for the masses to struggle against him. If they haven't poured out all their grievances, they can continue to struggle."

　　Hearing this statement, I couldn't help but be moved, but then I thought: this is just pretty talk. I secretly resolved to observe his actual performance. I wanted to see how a man with a gun, an Eighth Route Army soldier, would draw the line between personal interests and the interests of the masses, the line between family interests and national interests.

　　Chen Erpang was full of life again. I could understand his happiness. An Eighth Route Army soldier in power, and his son, had now returned. The property that had been confiscated would return with his son's return, that was a certainty. But when father and son met, the son only greeted his father warmly and didn't talk about anything else. When the father talked about life, the son said, "There's food to eat if you work." The father said the mass struggle was chaotic. The son knew that the masses had struggled against his father, but he didn't forget that the Xianshui family were dependents of revolutionary soldiers. They sent four or five bags of grain to Xianshui's wife and some good furniture and fifteen mu of good land. The masses handled it rationally, in an orderly manner, clearing what should be cleared, and taking care of what should be taken care of, with steady steps, not in a mess at all.

　　In the evening, the family surrounded him. His father and sister insisted that he find a way to get back the things returned to the masses. Chen Xianshui shouted, "Even if Chairman Mao came, he couldn't stop the masses from struggling against bullies!" Everyone standing in the courtyard heard this shout, and the room fell silent.

　　I mingled among the villagers who came to visit him, sitting in the dark corner of his room. In the dim light, I carefully examined the unremarkable face of this ordinary Eighth Route Army soldier, listening to him slowly tell his family and guests how they repelled the Yan Xishan army's offensive on the East Qin line. Gradually, I heard a deep, coal-fire-like passion burning persistently in his slow words. Especially when he spoke of their self-defense counterattacks, he exclaimed, "Ha! We really charged fiercely!" He excitedly said that their unit had all been equipped with American short guns and then said that the villagers analyzed the differences between the American-made guns they captured and the Zhu De-style and Zuo Quan-style guns made in the liberated areas….

　　Chen Xianshui joined the War of Resistance against Japan at the age of eighteen and is now only twenty-two. Chen Erpang shook his head and sighed as he talked to me about Xianshui's past: Once, late at night, Chen Xianshui had a mission to pass through the village. He only woke up the long-term worker in his own family's outer courtyard kitchen, chatted for a while, rested for a while, and did not wake up his long-separated family in the deep courtyard, and then set off again. …Another time, after fighting in Xiangyuan, Chen Xianshui was wounded and bandaged. He was passing through Anyang Village and bypassed the village, avoiding the loving harassment of his family. He thought that would cause him to fall behind! This time, on the third day, he was about to leave. His family insisted that he stay for a few more days and watch the Anyang Village temple fair before leaving. He smiled seriously and said, "The team has left, the team doesn't wait for people. Where would you have me go then?" This young man, who knew no other place to stand other than the army, left with his two partners early in the morning, carrying their American-made light machine guns to return to the team.

　　Regardless of the conclusions of historians, Da Yu is ultimately a highly admired figure in the minds of the Chinese people, that is a fact. In order to control the turbulent floods of the world, "passing his home three times without entering" is even more of a timeless tale. And today, I saw this honest soldier Chen Xianshui, who wasn't very eloquent. I suddenly thought of Da Yu. This idea is not an exaggeration at all. Chen Xianshui, in the past to control the floods of the Japanese fascist invaders, and now to control the floods of domestic dictatorship and autocracy, is also running north and south, and is also passing his home without entering. I thought even more. I thought that Da Yu must also have been an honest man who was not good at words, and looked similar to Chen Xianshui. -- In short, this small soldier standing next to the radiant Da Yu is not ashamed at all.

　　Chiang Kai-shek, Marshall, you certainly have never seen such an earthy little soldier Chen Xianshui in your eyes, but he has always been very concerned about your movements. In late June, I saw him write a letter to his family from the Ping-Han front line, the words simple, the meaning clear: "I cannot return to Taihang recently because the Kuomintang reactionaries are attacking the liberated areas again." Let me say a sincere word: From now on, if you have any civil war plans being drafted, after my introduction as a former field reporter of the Central News Agency, please think humbly about this little soldier, Chen Xianshui, who is not good at speaking and is carrying an American-made light machine gun to defend an independent, peaceful, and democratic China. -- Because in my ten months of wandering in the liberated areas, I am certain that the real name of soldiers like Chen Xianshui should be: Eighth Route Army, and their number is: countless. Any wonderful plan cannot pass unless he agrees. If you stubbornly want to stick your gunpowder-filled nose into the liberated areas, it will be broken by Chen Xianshui. If you still boast about how wonderful the American weapons given to you are, Chen Xianshui will unceremoniously snatch them over and try them out first.

　　In Anyang Village, I lived for one hundred and nineteen days from February 28th to June 25th, just like some villages I visited before and after. I looked at it over and over again. I thought of the days when I used to observe cells under a microscope at school. I heard that Mr. Chen Lifu used it to describe the "party affairs work" he did and the "party-run education" he did, and the words were telegraphed incorrectly. As a former reporter for the Kuomintang Central News Agency, regardless of how stubbornly you refuse to listen, I still need to report a cell of the liberated areas to you, so that you can leave some room for abuse in the future.

　　I saw the sun shining brightly in the northern blue sky, and there were ten thousand grains of gold on the threshing floor. The farmers were lying on their carts full of straw, driving their livestock slowly towards the village, leisurely shouting. The children were happily shaking and hitting the red dates. And the attacking artillery fire sounded. I saw the farmers put a snow-white towel on their heads in a hero's knot, patted off the dust, and went to sign up for the army. My conscience tells me that I can no longer remain silent. In the sound of artillery fire, I filled my pen… (The End)

　　站在大禹身边的陈先水
    高而公
    我正在街上和老乡们扯着闲话时，有三个不相识的全副武装的八路军战士进村了，老乡和他们亲热的招呼了，这是安阳村抗战时出去的战士，有两个战士背着的枪样式很别致，问起才知道这是国民党军进攻时“送”来的美造轻机枪，他们刚刚从东沁线上下来，队伍经过潞城县，在县里休息三天，并且下令，这一带有家的战士可以自愿的回家去看看。“我们就回来了”，他们解释着说，这些战士们在得令以后便自由的散开飞回自己温暖的小窠，还带着他们的武器。
    虽然这里老乡八年来对于八路军一声令下可以三三两两一伙分散开打麻雀战，一阵子又在指定的时间地点集合起来的事情看得惯了，看得很平常，然而对于我却不能不是一个大大的震动。我在中央社总社一直采访着兵役新闻，我却从未得到一条类似这段情况的新闻，如果在国民党部队里的士兵听到一声自由散开去吧，那结果——我看用不着我再多罗索，国民党区域里每个人都会很正确的回答这个问题的。
    当我知道三个人中有一个叫陈先水的，确实引逗起我的注意来了，因为他是陈二胖的儿子。
    陈二胖，是本村的大经营地主，豢养着四匹牲口，雇了三个长工耕种着他的七十亩地。他自己不参加主要劳动，在敌人统治的八年中，大部分的时间是住在潞城城里，向伪政权的法院不断的纠缠着村里的弱者打官司。村里的人悲惨的说：“咱的钱熬不过人家，一打就败。”就这样陈二胖发达起来了，在村里一摇一摆走过带起一阵风，村人见了直要打颤颤。解放以后，老百姓站起来要同他算算八年来他自己不出负担不支差而转嫁到穷苦群众身上的这笔大帐。当帐目算清以后，陈二胖在经济上的地位垮了，在村中群众面前揭发了他的恶霸和讹诈，结结实实的丢了他的脸，从此我亲眼见陈二胖渐渐衰弱下来了，对老乡谈话也细声细气的显得温柔起来。
    这时他的儿子陈先水回来了。
    陈先水见到村政权负责人，表明了自己的态度，我看他是一个不大会说话的老实人，他朴素的然而却是一字一字明白的说了：
    “老皇（指日寇）在时，我父亲在村里恶霸的情形我知道的，比你们知道的还多。群众斗争了他，那是应该的，要是苦水没倒完，还可以斗。”
    听了这表白，我心中也不免一动，但旋即想了：此乃漂亮话也。私下决意要看看实际表现。我要看一个带枪的人，一个八路军，怎样来划分这个人利益与群众利益的界限，这家庭利益与民族利益的界限。
    陈二胖又虎虎有生气了，他的高兴我是可以理解的。一个当权的八路军，又是他的儿子，现在回来了，被清算了的财产将会随着儿子的归来而回来，那是铁定了。可是父子见面，儿子除了向父亲亲切的问候以外，别的却不谈，父亲说起生活，儿子说：“劳动就有饭吃。”父亲说群众斗争乱了。儿子知道群众斗争了父亲，却也没忘记先水家是抗属，给先水女人送来四五布袋粮食，还送给先水女人一些好家具和十五亩好地，群众理知的处理，有条不紊，该清算的清算，该照顾的照顾，脚步稳健，一点不乱。
    到晚上家庭向他形成了包围，他的父亲、姐姐一定叫他设法把还给群众的帐再要回来，陈先水大叫了：“就是毛主席来，也不能不让群众斗争恶霸呀！”这一声，院里站着的老乡都听到了从此房里寂然了。
    我混杂在进去探望他的乡亲们中间，坐在他屋角的黑暗处，在昏黄灯火中，仔细端详着这一位平凡的八路军战士的无特点的脸相，听他很迟顿的给家人和客人讲说着怎样打退阎锡山军队在东沁线的进攻。渐渐我听到了他的缓慢的用语中有着深沉的钢炭火一般的热情在耐久的燃烧着，特别是讲到他们的自卫反击时，他高声说：“哈！咱们真是猛打猛冲呵！”他又兴奋的说他们那一个单位已经统统换上了美国短枪，接着又说老乡们分析起他们打来的美造枪和解放区造的朱德式、左权式枪枝的差别……。
    陈先水十八岁那年参加了抗日战争，现在才二十二岁。陈二胖摇头叹气的同我谈起先水的往事：有一次，深夜陈先水有任务从村里过，他只在自己家的外院伙房里叫醒了长工，闲扯了一会，歇了一会，而没有叫醒深院里久别的家人，便又上路了。…又一次，打襄垣下来，陈先水挂了彩缠起绷带，正从安阳村经过，他从村外绕过去了，躲开了家庭给他的亲爱的烦扰，他想那会使自己掉队哩！这一次，第三天头上，他要走了，家人一定要留他再停几天，看了安阳村庙会再走吧，他严肃的微笑着说：“队伍开走了，队伍不等人，那时你叫我上那去呀？”这个除了队伍以外不知道别有立脚地方的年青小伙子，一清早同另外两个伙伴，背上他们的美造轻机枪归队去了。
    不管历史家研究的结论如何，大禹终归是中国人民心目中很崇拜的人物，这是事实。为了治天下滔滔的洪水，“三过其门而不入”更是千古美谈。而今天我看见了这不大会说话的老实的战士陈先水，我忽然想起了大禹，这想法一点都没有夸张的成份，陈先水以前为了治日本法西斯侵略者的洪水，现在为了治国内独裁专制的洪水也是南北奔走，也是一样的过其门而不入。我想得更多，我想大禹一定也是拙于言辞的一个老实人，和陈先水的模样差不多。——总之，这个小小的战士站在那光芒万丈的大禹身旁是毫无愧色的。
    蒋介石、马歇尔，你们的眼中当然从来没有看到这么一个土里土气的小兵丁陈先水，然而他却一直很关切你们的动静，在六月底我看他从平汉前线给家中写了一封信，字句简单，意思明确说：“最近不能回太行，因国民党反动派又向解放区进攻。”说一句诚心诚意的话吧，从今以后你们如果有什么内战计划在草拟时，经过我这昔日中央社总社的一个外勤记者的介绍，请你们也虚心点想一想这一个拙于辞令，手提美造轻机枪的保卫独立和平民主中国的小兵丁吧。——因为我在解放区十个月的漫游中，确知陈先水这样战士的真正名字应该就是：八路军，而他们的数量是：无数。任何美妙的计划不通过他的同意，那硬是行不通，带着火药气的鼻子硬要伸进解放区，那就硬是被陈先水碰破的。如果还要夸耀人家给你的美式武器如何高妙，陈先水就要毫不客气的夺过来先试用一下。
    在安阳小村，我从二月二十八日到六月二十五日住了一百一十九天，正像我以前和其后访问过的一些乡村一样，我翻来复去的看了又看，我想起从前在学校实验显微镜下观察细胞的日子了。听说陈立夫先生用来描写他所办的“党务工作”和他所办过的“党化教育”而被电报所传错了的话，我想作为从前国民党中央社的一名记者的我，不管你们在怎样摆头不听，我还是有报导一下解放区的一个细胞给你们听听的必要，以后你们即使漫骂也得留点分寸。
    我看见北方蓝天下阳光正耀眼，打谷场上黄金万颗，农民们卧在他拉满谷草的大车上往村里赶，自在的慢声吆喝着牲口，孩子们喜悦的摇打着红透了的枣子。而进攻的炮火响了，我见农民把雪白的毛巾在头上作了一个英雄结，拍拍尘土，就去报名参军了，我的良心叫我再也不能沉默了，在炮火声中我饮饱了我的笔尖……。（完）
