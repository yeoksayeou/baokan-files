[Reported by our newspaper from Ji, Lu, and Yu on October 31st] The United Associations of Workers, Peasants, Youth, Women, and Cultural Circles in the Ji, Lu, and Yu liberated area, representing the 12 million people of the entire Ji, Lu, and Yu liberated area, have issued a solemn appeal and accusation to the UN General Assembly, which is holding its first second session in New York, after hearing the news. They urgently demand that the UN General Assembly uphold justice and humanity, take effective measures to stop the US government from helping Chiang Kai-shek expand the Chinese civil war, and immediately withdraw American troops stationed in China. They also demand effective sanctions against Chiang Kai-shek's troops for undermining peace in China and the world, and to rescue the millions of people who have been raped, killed, and burned by Chiang Kai-shek's troops, leaving them homeless and displaced. The original telegram is as follows:

To the Presidium of the United Nations General Assembly:

Since Japan's surrender, Chiang Kai-shek, with military assistance from the US government, has been attacking our Ji, Lu, and Yu. In October of last year, he seized the county towns of Fugou, Xihua, Taikang, Qixian, and Tongxu, which we had recovered from the Japanese invaders. On January 13th of this year, after the ceasefire order participated in by US General Marshall was issued, Chiang's troops tore it up and occupied 18 county towns including Fengxian, Peixian, Jinxiang, Yutai, Caoxian, Dingtao, Dongming, as well as important cities like Heze and Jining. Not long ago, after Chiang Kai-shek occupied Zhangjiakou, he put on a facade of peace and put forward the so-called "Eight Demands," while at the same time sending troops north to occupy our Juye, Jiaxiang, and Yuncheng county towns. Currently, the attacks continue to escalate. Wherever Chiang's troops go, they burn, kill, and rape. Homes are reduced to rubble, and people die on the roads. In many villages, people are slaughtered entirely by Chiang Kai-shek's "Home-Returning Legions." In the areas around Dingtao and Juye counties, more than 30 American bombs fell on a small village of less than 50 households, completely flattening all the houses. In Anrenji in the Chiang Kai-shek occupied area, the director of the peasant association was cut in two with a hoe, his 18-year-old daughter was gang-raped to death, and his wife and eldest son were shot. At the same time, four peasants were killed in the village, and an old woman and a child were buried alive. In Fengxian city, Chiang's troops buried 25 people alive in one day. In the entire county, Chiang's troops have massacred more than 2,000 peasants. In Qing Sheji, northwest of Shanxian county, more than 500 peasants were killed in one place. Currently, in the more than 20 county towns occupied by Chiang's troops, at least 1,000 people have been brutally killed in each county, and the total number of people killed is no less than 20,000. The cruelty and viciousness of Chiang's troops are several times greater than that of the Japanese invaders. American-style Chiang airplanes and B-29s are bombing and strafing everywhere. More than two-thirds of the 20+ occupied counties have been bombed and strafed. Villages near the Chiang Kai-shek occupied areas are bombed and strafed by American-style Chiang airplanes without exception. On September 22nd, two Chiang airplanes, one of which was a B-29, bombed He Pingji in Juye county, injuring 10 peaceful residents and killing seven, half of whom were children aged 12 or 13. On September 16th, in a village near Zhaolou, north of Heze city, three residents and 21 cattle were killed by Chiang airplanes. In Juye's Da Yi Ji, it was bombed three times in one day, with four bombs dropped and strafing lasting 20 minutes, severely injuring three residents. On October 8th, four Chiang airplanes and American B-29s bombed and strafed the Qizhuang area of Juye at low altitude, dropping more than 70 incendiary bombs. Sixteen houses were completely burned down. Five civilians and three cattle were killed. In mid-October, a bombing in Linpuji, Juancheng killed and injured more than 70 civilians, causing an unprecedented tragedy. In other places, such as Puyang and Yuncheng, countless people have been killed by Chiang's airplanes bombing and strafing. Chiang Kai-shek's troops are even more ruthless to the wounded soldiers of the Eighth Route Army. Four seriously wounded soldiers of the Eighth Route Army, including Li Chengming, were living in Changji and were killed by Chiang's troops who gouged out their eyes, cut out their tongues, scraped their bellies, and cut out their hearts. On the 9th, in Cuige Village, a wounded soldier was beheaded and his head was hung on a tree by his ears with iron wire, his eyes were gouged out, and his nose and lips were cut off. In Chenji, Dingtao, and Baimaoji, Kaocheng, all the women were raped. After Chiang's troops arrived in Chenji, they locked the women in the house and gang-raped them. In the Cao Hu family, the new daughter-in-law was raped, and when the mother-in-law and neighbors begged for mercy, Chiang's troops placed their American-style automatic rifles on the old lady's shoulder and fired 25 shots, scaring her to death. In Xiaolizhai, 16 households, six of which did not escape, all the women were gang-raped to death. Recently, to coordinate with the military offensive, the Kuomintang reactionaries released water from the Huayuankou Dike in an attempt to drown all 12 million people in our liberated areas. All of these crimes by Chiang Kai-shek have been carried out with the assistance of the US government. The airplanes and various light and heavy weapons used by Chiang's troops are all supplied by American reactionaries. In the battle of Dayang Lake in Heze, the captured machine gun bullet boxes were marked with "US-made 7.9mm rifle pointed bullets, 20 rounds per box." The artillery shells were all shipped from the United States. Chiang Kai-shek and his troops have in effect become the executioners and tools of the American reactionaries for slaughtering the Chinese people. Today's civil war in China was created single-handedly by the American reactionaries. While feigning mediation, the US government authorities are actually harboring a cruel wolf's heart, providing Chiang Kai-shek with a large number of killing weapons and encouraging him to massacre the people in our border areas, causing millions of people in our border areas to become homeless and destitute. To date, the US government authorities are still training and equipping Chiang Kai-shek's troops with their own American officers. According to a Chiang's army officer captured by the Eighth Route Army, "More than 1,500 Chiang's army officers are being trained in Changde, and there are 24 American instructors, with Lieutenant Colonel Lake as the chief instructor. In addition to training Chiang's army in the use of American-style light and heavy weapons, they also give political speeches." As the UN General Assembly convenes, the 12 million people in our border region specially appeal to the Assembly. We urgently hope that the UN General Assembly will truly and effectively exercise its powers, stop the US from aiding Chiang in the civil war, demand that the US government immediately withdraw American troops stationed in China, and take concrete and effective measures to eliminate Chiang Kai-shek's internal war atrocities against the Chinese people and his serious threat to world peace.

The Workers, Peasants, Youth, Women, and Cultural Circles, and the 12 million people of Ji, Lu, and Yu, respectfully plead. October 27th, 35th year of the Republic of China.

　　冀鲁豫千二百万人民
    向联合国大会沉痛呼吁
    以有效措施使驻华美军立即撤退
    制裁破坏中国与远东和平之蒋军
    【本报冀鲁豫十月三十一日电】联合国首届第二次大会，在纽约开会，消息传来后，冀鲁豫工人、农民、青年、妇女及文化界联合会，代表全冀鲁豫解放区一千二百万人民向联合国大会发出沉痛呼吁和控诉。迫切要求联合国大会主张正义与人道，以有效措施停止美国政府帮助蒋介石扩大中国内战，并立即撤退驻华美军。对破坏中国及世界和平之蒋介石军队给以有效之制裁。挽救被蒋介石军队奸淫烧杀以致无家可归，流离失所的数百万人民。原电如下：
    联合国大会主席团公鉴：我国自日本投降之后，蒋介石便在美国政府军事援助下，向我冀鲁豫进攻。去年十月夺去我从日寇手中收复之扶沟、西华、太康、杞县、通许等县城。今年一月十三日，由美国马歇尔所参加之停战令颁发之后，蒋军又将其撕毁，侵占我丰县、沛县、金乡、鱼台、曹县、定陶、东明等十八个县城，及荷泽、济宁等重要城市。不久之前，当蒋介石在侵占张家口之后，一面戴上和平面具，提出所谓“八项要求”，一面又驱军北上，侵占我巨野、嘉祥、郓城等县城，目前进攻仍有增无已。蒋军所到之处，烧杀奸淫，庐舍为墟，人民死亡载道，不少村庄人民被蒋介石“还乡团”全家杀绝。在定陶、巨野等县一带、一个不到五十户的小村，落下的美国炸弹在三十枚以上，所有房屋全被炸平。在蒋介石侵占区安仁集的农会主任，被用镢刀刨成两段，其十八岁之女儿被轮奸而死，其妻子和大儿被枪毙。该村同时又被杀死农民四人，一个老太太和小孩被其活埋。丰县城蒋军一天内即活埋二十五人。全县已被蒋军屠杀农民两千余人。单县九月中旬，被捕去二十人，被杀死六十余人。城武西北青社集一处，即杀死农民五百余人。目前在蒋军侵占之二十余县城中，每县被残杀者，至少在一千以上。全部被杀者不下两万人。蒋军之残暴恶毒，超过日寇数倍。美式蒋机及空中堡垒更到处轰炸扫射，在二十多个县城中，被轰炸扫射者在三分之二以上。接近蒋军侵占区之村庄，没一村不遭受美式蒋机之轰炸扫射。九月二十二日，蒋机两架，其中一架为空中堡垒，轰炸我巨野县和平集，炸伤和平居民十人，死七人。其中半数为十二三岁的儿童。九月十六日，荷泽城北赵楼附近某村，被蒋机炸死居民三人，黄牛廿一头。巨野大义集三日一天中，即三次被炸，投弹四枚，扫射达二十分钟，居民三人负重伤。十月八日，四架蒋机及美国空中堡垒，在巨野起庄一带，低空轰炸扫射，投燃烧弹七十余枚。房屋十六间全被焚毁。老百姓死五人，并死黄牛三头。十月半，在鄄城临濮集轰炸，死伤老百姓七十余人，造成空前惨剧。其他各地，如濮阳、郓城等地，被蒋机轰炸扫射而死者举不胜举。蒋介石军队对八路军之伤员，更残忍无比，长集住有八路军李成明等四个重伤员，被蒋军剜眼割舌刮腹剜心而死。九号在催阁村，一伤员被割头用铁丝穿着耳朵挂在树上，两眼被剜，鼻子上唇被割去。在定陶陈集及考城白茅集，妇女全被强奸。蒋军到陈集后，将妇女关在屋内，实行轮奸。曹胡同一家，新媳妇被强奸，婆母邻居求饶，蒋军便将其美式自动步枪架在老太太的肩上，打了廿五发，活活将其吓死。小李砦十六户人家，其中六户没跑掉，妇女全被轮奸而死。近为配合军事上的进攻，国民党反动派又在花园口堤口放水，企图将我解放区一千二百万人民全部淹死。蒋介石所有这些罪行，都是在美国政府的援助下进行的。蒋军所用之飞机及各种轻重火器，都由美国反动分子所供给。在荷泽大杨湖战斗中，所缴获之机步枪子弹盒上都有“美制七九步枪尖弹每盒廿粒”等标记。大炮弹则系全部由美国运来，蒋介石及其军队，实际上已成为美国反动派屠杀中国人民的刽子手和工具。中国今日之内战，为美反动派一手造成。美国政府当局，一面伪装调解，但实际上却下着残忍的狼心，大量帮助蒋介石杀人武器，鼓励蒋介石屠杀我边区人民。致使我边区数百万人民无家可归，家破人亡。至目前为止，美国政府当局，还在由自己派去的美国军官，亲手训练和装备蒋介石军队。据八路军所俘虏之蒋军某军官谈称：“在常德受训之蒋军军官一千五百余人，其中有美国教官二十四人，总教官即为雷克中校。除训练蒋军使用美式轻重火器外，并作政治讲话”。当联合国大会举行之际，我们边区一千二百万人民特向大会呼吁。我们迫切希望联合国大会真正有效的行使其职权，停止美国援蒋内战，要求美国政府立即撤退驻华美军。采取具体有效办法，消除蒋介石对于中国人民的内战暴行，及对于世界和平之严重威胁。
    冀鲁豫工、农、青、妇、文、暨一千二百万人民同叩。民国三十五年十月二十七日
