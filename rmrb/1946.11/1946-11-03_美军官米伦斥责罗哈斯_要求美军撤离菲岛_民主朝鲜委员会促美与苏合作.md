　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 30th: TASS, New York, 28th: The American magazine *The Nation* published an article by Millen, a former officer in MacArthur's Philippine headquarters (who has now been demobilized), demanding the immediate withdrawal of US troops stationed in the Philippines. Millen criticized Roxas (the Philippine President) for attempting to establish a fascist state, eliminating all opposition through terror, and attempting to link the economy with the United States for twenty-eight years in a way that benefits the United States but harms the Philippines, causing the Philippine industry to decline, the people to be oppressed, and making it almost impossible to exist. Millen demanded that the United States should immediately find a way to correct this situation, that the US military should formally recognize the contributions of the Philippine People's Anti-Japanese Army in the anti-Japanese struggle, and that the courts should be forced to try all Filipino traitors, especially Laurel and Vargas. It is widely believed that Roxas is planning to pardon them.
　　Washington Dispatch, New China News Agency, Yan'an, 31st: The "Democratic Korean Committee," a Korean organization in the United States, whose chairman is Mr. Lim Ban, sent a letter to US Secretary of State Byrnes on the 26th, hoping that the United States and the Soviet Union would cooperate to resolve the current deadlock in accordance with the Cairo Declaration and the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference resolutions. The letter also said: "I am very clear about the current obstacles preventing the Korean people from expressing any opinions. I hope that the American diplomatic authorities under the command of President Truman will allow the Korean people to express their opinions."
