[Reported by our reporter group on the front line of Ji-Lu-Yu on the 16th] Yuncheng, which had been actively developed by the democratic government and was gradually recovering and becoming prosperous, was immediately turned into a dead city after being occupied by Jiang's troops. Jiang's troops heavily conscripted bricks and wood from the masses, and used small armed groups to capture villagers around the city who had not escaped, to build fortifications for them. The houses between the streets in the city were all connected, and many houses were demolished. Bunkers were built at every street corner, and the doors of all shops were removed to cover the fortifications. A large surrounding wall was built ten miles away from the city, and no trees could be seen within five miles outside the city. Even the stone tablets on the graves were taken away to build pillboxes. The Kuomintang secret agents colluded with the returning corps, which was composed of former puppet organizations, and often went to nearby villages to seize chickens and demand wine to give gifts to the "Central Army" in the city. The local people could not bear the abuse of Jiang's puppets, and joined the guerrilla armed forces in groups to persist in the overall struggle.

　　郓城蒋军拆毁民房修地堡
    民不聊生群起打游击
    【本报冀鲁豫前线记者团十六日电】经民主政府积极建设而逐渐恢复与日趋繁荣的郓城被蒋军侵占后，立即变成一座死城，蒋军向群众大征砖木，并用小股武装至城周围村庄抓捕未及逃脱之老乡，为其修筑工事，城内各街道间之房屋均被打通，许多房子均被拆毁。每个街头均修有地堡，各铺店之门板均被拆去蓬盖工事。距城十里周围修成一大围墙，城外五里以内已看不到一颗树木，坟上的石碑也被拉去修了碉堡。蒋特纠集过去伪组织人员组成的还乡团经常到附近村庄捉鸡要酒，给城内“中央军”送礼，当地群众不堪蒋伪蹂躏，成群的加入游击武装，坚持全面斗争。
