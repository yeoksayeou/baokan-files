　　Democratic National Construction Army Commander Zhang Submits Letter to this Newspaper
    Accusing Chiang Kai-shek's Agents of Assassinating His Eldest Son
    [Jinji-Luyu, 30th dispatch] Zhang Xiujiang, Commander of the 4th Regiment, 2nd Division, 1st Army of the Democratic National Construction Army, recently submitted a letter to this newspaper, indignantly accusing Chiang Kai-shek's agents of their crimes. Commander Zhang stated in his letter: My eldest son, Qingsen, was sixteen years old this year. On September 16th in his hometown of Puyang, he mistakenly received two injections of calcium oxide from a special agent doctor named Lü Dianjie. In less than ten minutes, his body turned blue, and he soon died. Lü Dianjie used to work in the Japanese invaders' assassination squads, and now he has become a Chiang Kai-shek agent. In Puyang, a political commissar from a certain sub-district and a young child from a certain street were also killed by poison needles. Sen'er was the third victim. He also stated: Sen'er once fainted due to an enemy plane night raid on Puyang in his childhood and was revived after more than ten days of medical treatment. This time, the poison needle was impossible to save, showing that the Kuomintang agents are even worse than enemy aircraft. We must be vigilant and strictly guard against special agents. Finally, he stated: Sen'er suffered a lot of hardships in his childhood. He did not love money, he had integrity. This summer, I brought him back from the Kuomintang-controlled area, hoping to cultivate him deeply, but unexpectedly, he was murdered by Chiang Kai-shek's agents. This is what makes me the most sad and grieved. Who is the murderer who killed him? We must eradicate the source of this murderer.

　　民主建国军张团长投函本报
    控诉蒋特暗害其长子
    【晋冀鲁豫三十日电】民主建国军第一军二师四团团长张秀江，顷投函本报，悲愤控诉蒋特罪行。张团长函称：我的长子清森，今年十六岁，九月十六日于濮阳原籍误买特务医生吕殿杰注射氧化盖两针，不到十分钟，满身发青，不久就死了。吕殿杰过去在日寇暗杀团工作，现在变为蒋特。在濮阳被毒针打死的，有某分区一个政委，某街一个幼儿，森儿是第三个牺牲者。又称：森儿曾于幼年因敌机夜袭濮阳，昏死了一次，经多方医治，十余日后始得复生。这一次的毒针，竟无法挽救，可见国特甚于敌机。我们要警惕起来，对特务严加防范。最后称：森儿于幼年遭受很多磨难，他不爱钱，有气节，今年夏天才把他从国民党统治区招回，希图培养深造，不意竟遭蒋特谋害，这最使我伤心悲痛。谁是杀他的凶手，我们定要根绝这凶手的泉源。
