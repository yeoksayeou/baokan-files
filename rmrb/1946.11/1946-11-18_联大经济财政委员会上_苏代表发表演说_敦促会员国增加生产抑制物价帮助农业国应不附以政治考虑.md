Chenggong Lake News: Soviet Representative Gromyko delivered a speech at the United Nations "Economic and Financial" Committee on the 13th, urging the General Assembly to call on the grain-producing countries of the United Nations to increase harvests. Certain countries should take many practical measures to prevent any rise in prices in order to protect the interests of consumers. Industrial countries should pay great attention to countries that need basic agricultural machinery, and when giving assistance to these countries, political considerations should not be attached.

    敦促会员国增加生产抑制物价帮助农业国应不附以政治考虑
    【新华社延安十五日电】成功湖讯：苏联代表葛罗米柯于十三日在联合国“经济与财政”委员会发表演说，敦促联合大会号召联合国的产粮国家，增加收获。某些国家应采取许多确实的措施，以防止物价的任何上涨，以便保护消费者的利益。工业国家应对需要基本农业机器的国家予以极大的注意，而在给予这些国家以帮助时，不要附以政治的考虑。
    【新华社延安十三日电】纽约讯：联合国大会第一“政治安全”委员会定十一日讨论特别小组委员会所提出的议案，即阿尔巴尼亚、外蒙古、爱尔兰、外约旦、葡萄牙等国请求加入联合国的问题，应交安理会重新考虑。关于此事，苏联代表葛罗米柯曾于七日在第一委员会发表长篇演说，对申请加入联合国者之资格提出标准，主张委员会应考虑申请国在第二次大战中之行为及态度。捷克代表亦提出建议，认为在考虑时应严格考查他们，特别是他们在第二次世界大战中的功绩。
