　　[This dispatch was sent from Weixian on the 30th of this month.] The Jinnan New District's anti-traitor liquidation movement has lasted three months. In twenty-five counties, over four thousand villages have preliminarily completed land reform. The speed and intensity of the movement are unprecedented, involving over two and a half million peasants in the struggle. In Yongzhi, all three hundred-plus villages have been mobilized. In the Second District, over forty villages have recovered 4,065 mu of land, 9.4 million yuan, 27,500 jin of grain, 3,500 jin of cotton, and 200 houses. In Wuxun, over 570 of the 629 villages have been mobilized, ensuring that everyone has land to cultivate and a house to live in. The Xia En Sha area (First and Fourth Districts of Gaotang, First, Fourth, and Eighth Districts of Xiajin, First, Fifth, and Sixth Districts of Enxian) which was under enemy, diehard, and puppet rule for over eight years, has mobilized 350 villages, realizing "land to the tiller". In the First District of Guocheng, 580 poor peasant households in 49 villages have also recovered over 4,500 mu of land. Middle peasants who did not receive land were given cash, trees, furniture, and residential land. In the Second District of Handan, all eighty-one villages have been mobilized, with each peasant receiving an average of four to five mu to seven to eight mu of land. In the Fourth District of Chengci, 34 villages recovered 10,439 mu of land in the liquidation of 111 landlords, benefiting 4,414 peasant families. In the Fifth District, peasants in 25 villages recovered 4,298 mu of land, 90,000 jin of grain, 9.61 million yuan, and 265 houses. In Beixu Village in the Sixth District, the masses recovered 3,532 mu of land, with each person receiving an average of 4.65 mu of land. Absolute poverty has been completely eliminated, and all poor peasants have risen in status. In Nanning, all 111 villages have realized "land to the tiller", with 85% of peasants involved in the struggle. All 16,604 poor peasant households and 1,706 utterly destitute households in the county have been eliminated. In the five villages of Nan, Bei Dingcao, Dong, Nan, and Xi Town in the Second District, 1,420 peasant households received 6,606 mu of land, and all 149 utterly destitute households were eliminated. Through this movement, land reform in the New District is even more thorough than in the Old District. These achievements were made possible by: Firstly, all-out support, going deep into the masses, showing the attitude, and the government resolutely backing the masses. Local organizations have transferred one-third to one-half of their cadres to organize turn-over teams and go to the villages to mobilize the masses. They have corrected the village cadre line, approached poor peasants, repeatedly showing wholehearted help to the masses. The government also resolutely backed the masses, making them deeply feel that the government is their own, emboldening them, and completely dispelling all concerns. Secondly, breaking the old patterns and doing everything based on the urgent needs of the masses, doing whatever the masses said to do. Facts have proven that in mobilizing the masses in the New District, a one-size-fits-all approach is the best way to universally mobilize the masses and quickly move the masses. The contradiction between poor peasants and tenant farmers was resolved, and middle peasants were also mobilized as a result of the benefits they received. Thirdly, it is due to being bold, letting go, and daring to act. The past ideas and practices of fearing that the masses would be "leftist" or "chaotic" and fearing that the masses would violate policies, restricting hands and feet, have been completely corrected. Fourthly, the border areas combined anti-traitor liquidation movement with the development of armed struggle. For example, the Xia En Sha area is close to the areas entrenched by the puppet regime. In the first half of the year, puppet regime special agents constantly harassed, sabotaged, and assassinated. We have organized militia armed suppression. This time, the mass movement was closely integrated with the militia work, constantly cracking down on the ferocity of puppet bandits and special agents, which encouraged the masses and enhanced the courage of anti-traitor liquidation. Now the large-scale stage of anti-traitor liquidation in Nanning, Baixiang, Yongzhi, Wuxun, Handan and other counties has been successfully concluded. They are reorganizing their organizations, clearing the fruits, conducting patriotic self-defense education, and combining it with a major review of the turn-over to solve the land problems of villages and individual farmers that were missed in the large-scale movement.

　　冀南新区廿五县四千余村
    初步实现土地改革
    二百五十万农民卷入运动赤贫绝迹
    现正整顿组织解决遗漏村土地问题
    【本报威县三十日电】冀南新区的反奸清算运动历时三月，二十五县内已有四千余村初步完成土地改革，运动的迅速和猛烈为前所未有，卷入斗争的农民计有二百五十余万。永智三百余村已全部发动起来，二区四十余村即追回土地四千零六十五亩，款九百四十万元，粮二万七千五百斤，棉花三千五百斤，房子二百间。武训六百二十九村已有五百七十余村发动起来，已作到人人有地种，人人有房住。夏恩沙区（高唐一、四区，夏津一、四、八区，恩县一、五、六区）曾为敌顽伪统治八年多，已有三百五十村发动起来，实现了耕者有其田。故城一区四十九村的五百八十户贫农亦收回土地四千五百多亩，没得到土地的中农都分到现款、树木、家具、宅基等。邯郸二区八十一村全部发动起来，每个农民都平均得到四五亩到七八亩土地。成磁四区三十四村，在和一百十一家地主的清算中，追回土地一万零四百三十九亩，得到土地的农民共达四千四百十四家；五区二十五村农民追回土地四千二百九十八亩，粮九万斤，款九百六十一万元，房二百六十五间；六区北徐村群众追回土地三千五百三十二亩，每人平均得到土地四亩六分五，赤贫完全消灭，贫农全部上升。宁南一百一十一村全部实现耕者有其田，有百分之八十五的农民卷入斗争，全县一万六千六百零四户贫农、一千七百零六户赤贫全部消灭。二区南、北丁曹、东、南、西镇五个村一千四百二十户农民得到土地六千六百零六亩，一百四十九户赤贫全部消灭。经过这次运动新区的土地改革比老区还彻底。这些成绩的获得：第一，是全力支持，深入群众，表明态度，政府坚决为群众撑腰。各地机关都抽调了三分之一到一半的干部，组织翻身队，下村发动群众。纠正了村干路线，接近了贫苦农民，反复表明了全心全意帮助群众，政府亦坚决为群众撑腰，使群众深刻感到政府是自己的，便壮了胆，所有顾虑完全打破。第二，是打破了旧的一套，作到一切从群众的迫切需要出发，群众说干啥就干啥。事实证明了，在新区发动群众，一揽子方式是普遍发动群众、使群众迅速大动起来的最好方式，贫农和雇佃的矛盾解决了，中农亦因此能得到利益发动起来。第三，是由于大胆放手、敢作敢为。过去怕群众“左”“乱”，怕群众违犯政策，束手束脚的思想和作风完全得到纠正。第四，边沿区结合反奸清算运动发展了武装斗争。如夏恩沙区紧接伪顽盘踞地区，上半年伪顽特务不断出扰，破坏，暗杀，我们曾组织了民兵武装进剿。这次群运中由于密切结合了民兵工作，不断打击了伪匪特务的凶焰，便鼓励了群众，增强了反奸清算的胆量。现在宁南，柏乡，永智，武训，邯郸等县反奸清算的大动阶段已告胜利，都正在整理组织，清理果实，进行爱国自卫教育，并结合进行翻身大检查，以解决大动中遗漏了的村庄及个别农民的土地问题。
