　　Yangcheng Prepares for War, Reaching a Climax
	Explosion Practice Movement Sweeps the County
	Militia Pool Funds to Open a Gunpowder Factory
	[This newspaper's Yangcheng dispatch on the 1st] Yangcheng's war preparations have entered a climax, with explosion practice movements sweeping the entire county. In the ten days from October 15th to 25th, each district successively ran five- to ten-day training courses for explosion research, with the slogan: "Learn Li Yong's method of setting up large-scale minefields, talk less and do more." After the training class in the Fifth District ended on the 26th, twelve villages had already been drawn into the movement. To solve the difficulties of equipment and gunpowder, the militia themselves pooled funds to open two gunpowder factories. To solve the consumption of practice explosions, Ji Jinguai, the director of the Mazhai Armed Committee, will lead the militia to transport silkworm cocoons to the city, earning back 20,000 yuan in one trip. They are also combining this with production, working day and night to harvest crops, threshing in the afternoon, and practicing martial arts in the morning. Activities such as cutting artemisia to boil saltpeter to make gunpowder and making thunderbolts and mines have become daily work for every male and female militiaman, and 7,000 stone mines have already been made. The Seventh District (New District), under the call to develop military equipment, prepare for war, and defend themselves, also immediately took action, opening an explosion factory to manufacture landmines and hand grenades, stipulating that one jin of Artemisia argyi ash can be exchanged for one mine. The armed construction of Xiling Village has developed the fastest, and has now expanded to ××× rifles, × light machine guns, × submachine guns, and × grenade launchers, becoming a strong combat force in the militia armament of the Seventh District.

　　阳城备战进入高潮
    爆炸练武运动遍全县
    民兵自己集股开设火药厂
    【本报阳城一日电】阳城备战工作已进入高潮，爆炸练武运动普遍全县。在十月十五到廿五的十天内，各区都先后开办了五天至十天的练武爆炸研究班，他们的口号是：“学习李勇大摆地雷阵办法，少说多做。”五区训练班二十六号结束后，已有十二个村卷入运动，为了解决用具火药困难，民兵自己集股开设了两所火药厂。为解决实习爆炸的消耗，马寨武委会主任吉金贵将领导民兵到城里运输蚕茧，一次赚回两万元。他们并和生产结合，日夜收场，下午打场，前晌练武。割蒿熬硝造火药，打雷制雷等活动已成为每个男女民兵的日常工作，现已打好石雷七千颗。七区（新区）在发展武装备战自卫的号召下，也立即行动起来，开设了爆炸工厂，制造地雷手榴弹，规定每斤青蒿灰换一颗。西岭村的武装建设发展最快，现已扩大到×××条步枪，×挺轻机枪，×挺冲锋枪，×个掷弹筒，成为七区民兵武装中一支强有力的战斗力量。
