　　【From Our Newspaper in Handan】The movement for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China has been widely and deeply launched in Handan, demanding the immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops from China. At 1:00 PM on the 24th, over 150 worker representatives from the city, representing workers from various large and small factories and shop employees and apprentices from the entire city, held a meeting at Taichang Flour Company. They unanimously resolved to actively resist American goods through production and support the frontlines, taking practical action to respond to the movement for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China. Each worker compared their past and present lives, proving that Chiang Kai-shek and the U.S. military, like the Japanese puppets, could only provide workers with a life of starvation, cold, and suffering like beasts of burden, while the Communist Party's democratic government gave everyone democratic freedoms and improved living conditions. Shop employee Zhang Shen said, "In the past, I was beaten and scolded by the shopkeeper, but now I have three freedoms: freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, and freedom of learning. The United States is helping the traitor Chiang Kai-shek to take away these freedoms, and we must eliminate him!" Workers from the electric light factory said, "Think about who gave us happiness? It's the Communist Party and Chairman Mao! The United States and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek want to eliminate the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army, and destroy the Chinese nation. We will support the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army and fight for China's independence, peace, and democracy, and defeat the joint US-Chiang offensive." Shi Huaizhi, an old technician from the flour company, said, "We workers have no other way to help the Eighth Route Army except with our two hands. We must increase production. The flour factory's production has increased from 500 bags in April and May to more than 800 bags. In the future, we must work harder so that the soldiers at the front can eat a few more bags of flour." When mentioning the atrocities of the U.S. military, shop employee Zhang Jingli said, "Now the American imperialists want to turn China into a colony. In the places they occupy, people cannot live, and they are more brutal than the Japanese." Yu industry worker Shi Lei said with fervor, "The United States lends military supplies to the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, and the money comes from us, the common people. This is taking our money to beat us." He said, "We must treat the United States and Chiang Kai-shek the same way we treated the Japanese and Wang Jingwei!" Comrade Zhao Guoqiang, deputy director of the General Labor Union, was invited to speak. In addition to praising everyone for proposing to increase production to support the frontlines, he called on everyone to expand the workers' armed forces and prepare to launch guerrilla warfare. If the traitor Chiang Kai-shek does not stop his aggression, we will give him a severe blow. At present, we also need to step up the fight against traitors and eliminate the rumors and sabotage activities of special agents. After the meeting, it was heard that the Labor Union would formally discuss the issue of expanding the workers' armed forces.

　　邯郸全市工人代表座谈时事
    反对美军留驻中国
    决议加紧生产支援自卫前线
    工会号召扩大工人武装保卫翻身果实
    【本报邯郸讯】响应美军退出中国运动，已在邯郸普遍深入展开，要求美军立即退出中国。二十四日下午一时，全市工人代表一百五十余人，代表全市各大小工厂工人以及全市店员学徒，假泰昌面粉公司举行会议，一致决议以积极生产抵制美货，支援前线，以实际行动响应美军退出中国运动。每个工人都各就自己过去与现在的生活作比较，证明蒋介石与美军和日伪一样，只能给与工人冻馁和痛苦的牛马生活，而共产党民主政府才使大家获得了民主自由的权利和生活改善。店员张伸说：“过去我受掌柜的打骂，现在我有了三个自由：说话自由，开会自由，学习自由。美国帮汉奸蒋介石要夺去我们这些自由，我们就要消灭他！”电灯厂的工人说：“大家想想谁给我们的幸福？是共产党、毛主席！美国和其走狗蒋介石要消灭共产党八路军，要灭亡中华民族，我们就拥护共产党八路军，争取中国的独立和平民主，打败美蒋联合进攻。”面粉公司老技师史怀智说：“我们工人没有别的帮助八路军，就只有两只手，我们要加油生产，现在面粉厂的生产比四五月间的五百袋增加了三百多袋，今后我们要更加努力，使前方将士能多吃几袋面。”提到美军暴行时，店员张敬理说：“现在美军帝国主义要把中国变为殖民地，在他占领的地方，人民都无法生活，比日本人都残暴。”浴业工人石磊激昂的说：“美国借军火给汉奸蒋介石，钱还不是我们老百姓出，这是拿我们的钱打我们。”他说：“我们要像对付日本人和汪精卫一样来对付美国和蒋介石！”总工会副主任赵国强同志被邀请讲话，他除赞扬大家所提加紧生产支援前线外，并号召大家扩大工人武装，准备开展游击战争，如果汉奸蒋介石不停止进犯，就给他以严重打击。目前还需加紧反奸，肃清特务的造谣破坏活动。散会后，闻工会将正式讨论扩大工人武装问题。
