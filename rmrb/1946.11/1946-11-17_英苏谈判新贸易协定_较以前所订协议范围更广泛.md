　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 14th: According to a United Press report from the 11th, sources in London revealed that the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union are currently negotiating a new trade agreement in London. The negotiations are being conducted by the British Board of Trade and the Soviet trade delegation. The agreement under negotiation is broader in scope than the previous agreements reached by both parties. The Soviet Union will purchase goods from the United Kingdom and pay a small portion of the price in gold. It is generally believed that this specific proposal was put forward by the British side, and the British side is seeking instructions from Moscow. According to the agreement reached in the Anglo-Soviet trade negotiations in September of this year, it was stipulated that the Soviet Union would purchase machinery and electrical equipment worth 40 million pounds in the United Kingdom, and the United Kingdom agreed to purchase timber in the Soviet Union. The two sides signed a contract and established new trade relations. At that time, British officials stated that the main difficulties in Anglo-Soviet business relations had been eliminated.
