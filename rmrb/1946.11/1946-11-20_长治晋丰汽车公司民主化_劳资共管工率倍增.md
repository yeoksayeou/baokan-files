    [This dispatch from Changzhi] The Jinfeng Automobile Company in this city, under the slogan of "Support the Frontline," saw all its employees immediately become energized after reorganization. Labor and management jointly elected a management committee of five people, including Management Director Wang Xinghua, workers Wang Zhenkun, Wang Sihe, and Ningbo, to implement democratic management of the company. This was done to strengthen work and support the frontline. Repair workers broke the schedule-based work system, rushing to repair vehicles as soon as they got up each day, and continuing to repair under the lights until dark. This rapidly repaired vehicles that were out of service, to meet urgent needs. Driver Sun Naizhang, upon returning from a drive, participated in repair work the next day, and volunteered to drive again the third day, breaking the past habit of "resting upon return." The workers' friendship and unity was unprecedentedly strengthened, and the phenomenon of "not caring about other people's vehicles" disappeared. Two vehicles that were extremely difficult to repair were also repaired and put back into service within four days through everyone's efforts. The incidence of vehicle breakdowns on the road has also been greatly reduced. To frequently review and enhance work, the company now holds a general staff and worker symposium once a week.

    长治晋丰汽车公司民主化
    劳资共管工率倍增
    【本报长治讯】本市晋丰汽车公司在“支援前线”口号下，经整顿后，全体职工工作立即紧张起来。劳资双方选出管理主任王醒华、工人王振坤、王四合、宁波等五人成立管理委员会，对公司实行民主管理，以加强工作，支援前线，修理工人打破了按时作息制度，每天一起床就赶修汽车，直至黑夜还在灯下修理，使不能行驶的车辆迅速修好，以应急需。司机孙乃章开车回来，第二天就参加修理工作，第三天又抢着出车了，打破了过去“回来歇歇”的习惯。工人友爱团结空前增强，再没有你车我不管的现象。两辆顶难修的车也经大家动手，四天内修好，重新行驶了。车在半路出毛病的现象也大为减少。为经常检讨，增强工作，现该公司每礼拜召开全厂职工座谈会一次。
