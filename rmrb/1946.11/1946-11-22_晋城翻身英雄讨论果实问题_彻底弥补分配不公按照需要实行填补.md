(Our newspaper, Yangcheng, 18th dispatch) The Jincheng Liberated Heroes Conference was held on the 10th, spending a day and a half discussing the issue of distributing the fruits of victory. Yuan Lu, Chairman of the County Farmers' Association, pointed out the importance of distributing the fruits in his initial summary, saying: "Distributing the fruits is a crucial key to realizing 'land to the tillers'; if the distribution is unreasonable, with a few people getting a lot and the majority of farmers with little or no land not being able to completely turn themselves around, it will affect the unity of the farmers, alienate activists and cadres from the masses, and hinder the development of the movement."

Chairman Yuan continued: Based on a year's experience, where the distribution is fair and reasonable, a better democratic style is demonstrated, and fewer problems arise. For example, in Hedicun Village, the cadres initially took over the process, and most people remained silent. Later, when it came to joining the army, the masses were not enthusiastic. After a review, the fruits of victory were submitted to the masses for reasonable distribution, and the morale of the masses immediately turned around.

As for the general rules of distribution, according to the situation in each village, they can be roughly divided into three stages: The first stage is mostly based on individual liquidation and the degree of activeness. Without this, the movement cannot be universally deepened. In the meantime, there are also those who base it on individual problems, taking into account different situations to provide care, or extracting a portion of the fruits obtained from individual liquidation to take care of those who participated in the struggle but had no liquidation targets.

The second stage is mainly based on the situation and needs. This method of distribution is supported by the majority of people in areas where mass awareness has already been raised. Villages that have undergone such distribution have mostly implemented "land to the tillers." This can avoid the phenomenon of a few activists and cadres obtaining too many fruits.

The third stage is to make up for deficiencies, that is, to level and fill the gaps, so that farmers with less land who were not adequately distributed in the second stage can be compensated, completely realizing "land to the tillers." For villages such as Hedicun and Xiaodonggou, which have already realized "land to the tillers" and where the differences are not too large, no changes are generally made. For those who were silent in the past and did not obtain an appropriate amount of land, or whose distribution was not fair enough, filling the gaps is sufficient. In villages where the movement is still ongoing, the distribution can be discussed democratically by the masses based on the situation and needs.

Chairman Yuan finally pointed out: First, all Farmers' Associations that still have a large amount of land, grain, and other fruits of victory should immediately mobilize the masses to discuss distribution. Previous valuations should be cancelled. The fruits of victory should be distributed to the farmers. Second, land has differences in distance and quality, and should be matched with each other. In the past, where the distribution was unfair, appropriate handling should be carried out. The method of handling is that for some cadres, activists, or certain masses who have been allocated too many or too good fruits of victory, they can be mobilized to voluntarily give up some, or exchange land. The method of struggle should not be adopted. Third, in the past, land cultivated by organizations, troops, and cadres for production was often near and good land, and should be returned to the masses. If wheat has already been planted, both parties can be convened to study and deal with it. (He Li)

　　晋城翻身英雄讨论果实问题
    彻底弥补分配不公按照需要实行填补
    【本报阳城十八日电】晋城翻身英雄大会于十日召开，经一天半时间讨论分配果实问题。县农会主席原鲁在初步总结中指出分配果实的重要意义说：“分配果实为实现耕者有其田的重要关键；如果分配不合理，少数人得的多，大部少地无地的农民即不能彻底翻身。且会影响农民团结，使积极分子与干部脱离群众，障碍运动的发展。”原主席继称：根据一年的经验，那里分配的公平合理，那里便表现了较好的民主作风，那里出的问题比较少。如河底村，开始干部包办，大多数人不哼气。后来参军时，群众都不积极。以后经过检讨，果实提交群众合理分配后，群众情绪一下子便转过来。至于一般分配的规律，根据各村的情况，约可分作三个时期：第一个时期多是以个人清算和积极程度来分。因为不如此运动便不能普遍深入。在这中间，也有以个人问题为基础，再参酌不同情况予以照顾，或者在个人清算所得果实中提出一部分来照顾参加斗争而无清算题目的人。第二时期，主要是按情况与需要来分。这种分法，在群众觉悟已经提高的地区为大多数人所拥护。经过这样分配的村庄，大都实行了耕者有其田。可免除少数积极分子干部得果实过多的现象。第三时期，就是弥补，也就是填平补齐，使第二时期分配不周到的少地的农民得到弥补。完全实现耕者有其田。如河底、小东沟等村，已实现耕者有其田而相差不太悬殊的村，一般不加变动。对于过去不哼气而未得适当数量土地的或分配不够公平的，填平补齐就行了。凡运动正在进行的村，可按情况与需要，由群众民主讨论分配。原主席最后指出：第一，凡农会还保存有多量土地粮食等果实的，立即发动群众讨论分配。以前作价的，一律取消作价。将果实分配给农民。第二，土地有远近好坏的区别，应使互相搭配。过去分配不公的，回去应适当处理。处理的办法，对某些干部、积极分子或某些群众所分果实过多、过好，可动员其自动让出一些，或换地。不能采取斗争的办法。第三，过去机关、部队、干部因生产所种的地，不少为近地、好地，应退还群众。如已种麦，可召集双方研究处理。（贺笠）
