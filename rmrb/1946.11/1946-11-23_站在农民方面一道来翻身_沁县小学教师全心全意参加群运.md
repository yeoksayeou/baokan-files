Standing on the Peasants' Side to Overturn Their Fate:
Qin County Elementary School Teachers Fully Participate in Mass Movements

[Our newspaper, Yangcheng, 16th dispatch] After the mass movement was launched in Qin County, many elementary school teachers also joined the movement. In the seventh district, over sixty teachers, except for three who were landlords, participated in the mass struggle. In the fifth district, thirty-two out of thirty-eight teachers joined the movement. In other districts, more than half participated in the mass movement. In the past, they lived in the countryside with the peasant masses, and most of them were also exploited and oppressed by feudal forces. Therefore, they naturally provided direct assistance to the mass movement from their work positions. Wei Rongzhao, a teacher at Rensheng Village Elementary School, wrote the history of landlord Chi Zhihong's exploitation on the blackboard before the village's mass struggle against Chi Zhihong, and asked Li Guocai, who could compose music, to compose it into songs, which were sung everywhere. Liu Yaoxi, a teacher in Nangou, saw a shepherd boy being abused by his master in the village, so he appealed to the villagers on the blackboard to help the shepherd boy to turn over. Zhou Niuwu, a teacher in Bao Village, felt that the mass struggle in his village was not vigorous because people were afraid of hurting feelings and no one dared to start the fight against the landlords. Therefore, he first organized students in the school to take the lead in the struggle against the landlords, which boosted the courage of the masses to struggle. Li Xiangyang and Yang Jingru, teachers in Guxian Town, repeatedly persuaded their student, Li Huan's son, to go back and persuade his mother to accept the demands of the masses and return the grain, which finally led to the complete victory of the mass movement. Li Wei, a teacher in Nanwang Village, constantly collected the facts of exploitation by landlords and despots and supplied them to the Farmers' Association and the Farmers' Association work team. He also borrowed rice from his own savings to the tenants, encouraging them to resolutely fight against the landlords and despots. At the same time, he set up a "Turnover Report" column at the school gate to collect public opinions. He himself personally participated in the Farmers' Association and helped the masses fight against landlords and traitors more than ten times, finally winning the victory. Li Zhaoyun, a teacher in Baijiagou, did not go home during the holidays, but continued to help the masses turn over. Therefore, in the inspection of the turnover movement, many elementary school teachers became turnover heroes. Such as Ji Sanwang in Banzhai Village, Li Fangcun in Xiaozhuang, etc., are all models in the mass movement. Due to the participation of elementary school teachers, the mass movement was encouraged by the cultural circles. Now, after each struggle in the villages of Qin County, many new songs, ditties, and clappers appear, praising the liberation of the masses. The status of elementary school teachers in rural areas has also increased.

　　站在农民方面一道来翻身
    沁县小学教师全心全意参加群运
    【本报阳城十六日电】沁县的群众运动掀起后，很多小学教师也都卷入运动。七区六十多位教师除三个地主成分外，都参加了群众斗争。五区三十八位教师，即有三十二位加入运动。其他各区参加群众运动者，均在半数以上。他们过去与农民群众一齐生活在农村，大多数同样受封建势力的剥削与欺压，因此他们都自然的从自己工作岗位上给群众运动以直接帮助。任胜村小学教师魏荣照当该村群众斗争地主池志洪之前，他便把池志洪剥削人的历史写在黑板报上，并请能作曲的李国材编成歌曲，到处传唱。南沟教师刘耀西，在村中见一个放羊小孩备受主家虐待，便在黑板报上向全村农民呼吁帮助放羊孩子翻身。堡村教师周牛五感到本村群众斗争不起劲，原因是抓不破情面，无人敢向地主开头炮；他便在校内先组织学生带头斗争地主，鼓起了群众的斗争勇气。故县镇教师李向阳、杨静如数次说服他的学生——地主栗缓的儿子，教他回去劝母接受群众要求，退出粮食，终于使群众运动获得完全胜利。南王村教师李伟不断的搜集地主、恶霸的剥削事实，供给农会与农会工作队，并以自己节约的米借给佃户们，鼓励他们向地主、恶霸坚决斗争。同时在校门口设一“翻身报告”栏，搜集群众意见。自己则亲自参加农会，前后帮助群众向地主汉奸斗争十余次，终获胜利。白家沟教师李兆云放假亦不回家，依然帮助群众翻身。因此在检查翻身运动中，很多小学教师成为翻身英雄。如半寨村吉三旺、校庄李芳村等，均是群众运动中的模范。由于小学校教师的参加，群众运动得到文化界力量的鼓舞，现在沁县各村群众每经一次斗争，必有许多新的歌谣、小调、快板等出现，歌颂群众的翻身。小学教师在农村的地位亦随之提高。
