[Via this newspaper's correspondent in Weixian, 26th of this month] In the midst of active war preparations, over ten thousand liberated citizens of Daming City have completely dismantled a covert special agent assassination camp hidden in the city's southern district. The commander, deputy commander, company commanders, platoon leaders, and investigation team leader—nine individuals in total—have all been arrested. During preliminary interrogations by the masses, it was revealed that this special agent assassination camp was directly led by Li Yanmin, deputy head of the 2nd regiment of the 3rd brigade under the puppet Cheng Daosheng's command. Since this April, after the special agent camp commander Ma Hongming and deputy commander Yang Hongen, along with eight others, swore brotherhood, they have expanded their ranks to over thirty individuals. In order to lay the groundwork for attacking Daming, the special agents adopted deceptive tactics such as threats, bribery, and sworn brotherhood to provoke and sabotage organizations like branches, militias, and peasant associations. Yang Hongen had infiltrated the militia, aiming to further infiltrate the branch, seize leadership, and orchestrate the assassination of our mass leader Wang Hongyuan and city cadre Wang Zicheng, among others, to realize their vicious scheme of using the poor to kill the poor. The masses were filled with hatred when the special agents confessed their crimes at a public trial attended by over ten thousand people. However, to give the special agents a path to reform, they were asked to confess at the public trial, and depending on the degree of their confession, they would be released or continue to be detained for reflection. The public trial is still ongoing, and under the influence of the lenient policy, five special agents who had not been captured have already surrendered. The masses said: "No matter how cleverly the special agents operate, they can never escape the eyes of the liberated people."

　　备战中加紧防特大名翻身市民
    查获暗杀组织
    【本报威县二十六日电】大名市一万余翻身市民在积极备战中，已将隐蔽该市南关的特务暗杀营全部破获。正副营长、连长、排长及调查班长等九人均被逮捕。在群众初步审讯时供出该特务暗杀营直接受伪程道生部三旅二团副团长李燕民领导，从今年四月特务营长马洪明和副营长杨洪恩等八人拜为八大兄弟后，至今已发展到卅余人。特石为了打下进攻大名的基础，采取了威胁、收买、拜弟兄等欺骗方式，向支部、民兵、农会等组织内部进行挑拨破坏，杨洪恩已打入民兵，想进一步混进支部，掌握领导，并布置暗杀我群众领袖王洪元和该市干部王自成等，以实现其利用穷人杀穷人的毒辣阴谋。当特务在万余群众公审大会上认错时，群众无不痛恨；但为了给特务一条自新之路，在公审大会上由他们坦白，按他们坦白的程度，酌情释放或继续扣押反省。现公审大会仍在继续进行中，未被捕获的特务在宽大政策的影响下，已有五名自首。群众说：“不管特务活动如何巧妙，总跑不出翻身人们的眼睛”。
