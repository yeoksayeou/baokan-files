    Relying on Chiang's Army, the Henchmen and Local Tyrants Should Be Eliminated;
    Gao Luo Militia Executes the Two Caos

    [Our Dispatch] The brothers Cao Jinli and Cao Jinren were notorious local tyrants in Gao Luo Village, Yuanqu. Before the War of Resistance, the people of Gao Luo suffered immensely under their exploitation and oppression. After the Japanese occupied Yuanqu, the two Caos thrived even more, serving as Japanese intelligence agents, and their methods of oppressing the people became more numerous and widespread.

    In August of last year, after the Eighth Route Army liberated Yuanqu, the people were finally able to breathe again. In the movement to speak out about suffering and seek revenge, and to reduce rent and interest, the two Caos were naturally not exempt. However, the masses were not yet fully aware and were still somewhat polite to them, only forcing them to return a small portion of what they should have returned. This somewhat offended the two Caos, who couldn't sleep at night and plotted revenge. On August 27th, Chiang's army unreasonably occupied Yuanqu city and established strongholds in Gao Luo. The two Caos' dream came true, and they were naturally very happy, gleefully making contact and maintaining order. They then began to shout loudly: "It's time to turn the tables! With just a sneeze from me, I can cause a flood to drown you all!" This was Cao Jinli's boast to intimidate the masses. Jinren also boasted loudly: "With just a blink of my eye, I can bring lightning to strike you!" These boasts did not scare the people; on the contrary, they realized even more clearly, "We cannot rest easy until the boasters are eliminated." On the evening of October 4th, a militia squad, led by Instructor ×, set off for Xiyuan in the town. In less than an hour, the Cao brothers were both captured. Under the burning anger of the masses, they were executed. The masses said one after another: "Whoever is evil will lose his dog life," "Bad guys cannot escape the hands of the people." (Xi Bin)

    恃蒋军行凶恶霸应该消灭
    皋落民兵处死二曹
    【本报讯】曹近礼、遭近仁弟兄两个，是垣曲皋落村有名的恶霸，抗战前，皋落的老百姓，在他的剥削压榨下，痛苦万分，日人占垣曲后，二曹更吃得开，充当日本的谍报工作，压迫人民的手段更多，范围更大。
    去年八月，八路军解放垣曲后，老百姓才换过气来，诉苦复仇，减租减息运动中，二曹当然不在例外，但群众还未觉悟，对他还有些客气，只退出了一少部应退的东西，这样就有些得罪二曹。晚上睡不着觉，企图报复，八月二十七日，蒋军无理侵占垣曲城，并在皋落打下据点，二曹的梦做成了，当然高兴的很，喜笑洋洋的接了头，维持起来，回头便高声大叫起来了：“来翻身吧！我只要打个喷嚏，叫你们全遭水灾。”这是曹近礼威吓群众的吹牛，近仁也大吹起来：“我只要眼一圪眨，叫你们遭雷闪。”这些吹牛，没有吓倒老百姓，相反的更清楚认识，“吹牛者不消灭，不能放心。”十月四日的晚上，民兵一个班，在×指导员带领下向该镇西园出发了，不到一个钟头，曹家兄弟，同时做了俘虏，在群众怒火燃烧下，被处死，群众纷纷说：“谁坏，就要谁狗命，”“坏家伙逃不出人民的手心。”（希斌）
