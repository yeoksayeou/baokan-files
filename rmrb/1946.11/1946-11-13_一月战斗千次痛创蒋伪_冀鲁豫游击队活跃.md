    A Month of Fighting Inflicts a Thousand Painful Blows on Chiang Kai-shek's Puppets
    Guerrilla Warfare Active in the Jilu Yu Region
    The Army and People Heroically Resist and Smash Chiang Kai-shek's Regime
    [Report from this newspaper, Jilu Yu, 11th] Local armed forces and militia guerrillas active behind enemy lines in the Chiang-occupied areas of Jilu Yu engaged in over a thousand battles during the month of October, creating numerous examples and miracles. On October 6th, a unit of the local military force attacked the West Gate of Dongming, capturing over 200 Chiang Kai-shek special agents and "returning home corps" members. Over 3,000 Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops inside the city dared not move. On the 9th, a trainee staff officer from a local armed unit led eight scouts to intercept two Chiang Kai-shek military vehicles at Guanyintang, west of Shangqiu. They immediately used them to transport troops for a surprise attack on the puppet town government of Zhoutang, 15 miles southeast of Shangqiu, and won a victory. On the 25th, four guerrilla fighters from Fugou were surrounded by over a hundred men from the Zhang Guorong unit of the Fugou puppet security brigade in a village. They held their ground in village houses, fighting fiercely for four days and nights, and finally broke through victoriously, killing over 20 puppet soldiers and killing the puppet bandit leader Zhang Guorong, capturing six rifles and pistols. Furthermore, according to captured Chiang Kai-shek military officers from the recent battle of Juancheng, the Chiang Kai-shek army was restless and panicked by day and night due to the active militia guerrillas when passing through Xinxinji, about 20 miles north of Heze during this northern invasion. According to extremely incomplete statistics, in October, the Communist forces killed or wounded over a thousand Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops, captured 426 people, seized seven machine guns, 326 rifles and pistols, six cars, 26,000 jin of grain, and countless other military supplies and materials.
    [Another dispatch] In the Chiang Kai-shek occupied areas of Jilu Yu, the Chiang Kai-shek army's attempt to establish district and township governments has suffered a serious blow and has completely failed under the heroic resistance of the local armed forces, militia, and the broad masses of the people under the leadership of the local democratic government. In the current month, after the Chiang Kai-shek army invaded Heze and Caoxian in southwestern Shandong, they immediately used past puppet soldiers, traitors, and fleeing despotic landlords from the liberated areas to organize "armed returning home corps," ordering them to return to their hometowns to establish district and township governments in order to expand their area of control and achieve the goal of completely eliminating the liberated areas. Our liberated area army and people, understanding their treachery, launched a comprehensive resistance against the Chiang Kai-shek district and township governments and the "returning home corps" under the slogan of "block the stubborn bandits in the dead city." On September 23rd, Zhang Zili, the district chief of Qingqiu District in Heze, and Wang Denglun, the militia captain, led several militiamen in a night attack on Wanghaotun, capturing Chiang Kai-shek special agent Li Xinyan alive and publicly trying and executing him at a mass meeting the next day. On the 25th, District Chief Zhang of Dongming First District also led several militiamen to kill Sun Heizi, the head of the Sunqizhai returning home corps. On the 27th, a unit of our militia guerrillas shot and killed both the stubborn district chief and the head of the returning home corps, Li Xiaozhen, at Anrenji, Caoxian. On October 9th, our Kaocheng Independent Battalion attacked Guoxiaohu at night, killing the stubborn township chief Guo Maolin and wounding Chiang Kai-shek special agent Guo Lanxiang. Due to the active activities of our militia guerrillas, the Chiang Kai-shek regime in these areas has consistently been unable to establish itself. In places where the stubborn district and township governments have already been established, our local armed forces and militia concentrate their superior forces to drive them away or annihilate them in one fell swoop. On September 19th, our Qibin Brigade drove out the Dayangkou stubborn township government and seized a portion of grain. On the 20th, our Dongyuan Brigade completely defeated the Changyuan Security Police Brigade and the district headquarters stationed in Zhulin, killing five and capturing one doctor alive. On the night of the 25th, the Huashan local armed forces completely eliminated the Beikang Township government north of Dangshan City, capturing eight people and guns each. On the 26th, our Caoxian militia also completely annihilated the stubborn Third District District Government and the returning home corps south of Wangdian, killing one and capturing ten people and guns each. On October 5th, our Caoxian Brigade defeated the stubborn Second District District Headquarters at Fanhutong, more than 50 miles northwest of Caoxian, killing two, capturing four alive, and seizing seven guns. On the same day, our guerrillas, who had penetrated the Wenshangji area, resolved the Nanluji stubborn township government, capturing more than 30 people and seizing several thousand jin of wheat. On the 8th, the militia of Heze Pingling, Linhe, and Ganyuan Third Districts united to drive away the Guozhuangzhai District Headquarters, capturing several stubborn District Headquarters personnel alive, seizing three thousand jin of wheat, and two large carts of cotton. Under the continuous annihilation by our local armed forces and militia, most of the Chiang Kai-shek regime, which had just been established, was eliminated before it could gain a firm foothold. For the Chiang Kai-shek regime in the city and a few isolated strongholds, because there are Chiang Kai-shek troops stationed there, they cannot be eliminated for the time being. Our democratic government leads the local armed forces and militia to strictly blockade and encircle them, preventing them from going out. On September 24th and 25th, our Peitong militia captured three members of the returning home corps alive and killed two on the outskirts of Peixian, seizing three large carts of rice. On the 26th, they also captured a cook and a communications worker from the stubborn county government alive, obtaining one rifle each. On October 5th, our Caoxian militia captured two stubborn District Headquarters staff members alive on the Dingcao Highway, obtaining one pistol. On October 8th, our Linze Sixth District Team captured Liu Zili and several other stubborn District Headquarters grain requisition personnel in Luzhuang. As a result, the stubborn political workers trapped in the strongholds no longer dare to go out. Under the heroic resistance of our democratic government-led local armed forces and militia, the Chiang Kai-shek regime's attempt to establish district and township governments has completely failed, and the vast majority of villages and towns are still in the hands of our democratic government, and the people live a free life.

    一月战斗千次痛创蒋伪
    冀鲁豫游击队活跃
    军民英勇抗击粉碎蒋记政权
    【本报冀鲁豫十一日电】活跃于冀鲁豫蒋占区后方的地方武装和民兵游击队，在十月份一月中，战斗共千余次，创造了不少范例与奇迹。十月六日，地方兵团一部袭入东明西关，俘蒋特“还乡团”二百余人，城内蒋伪三千多人不敢出动。九日，地方武装某部见习参谋率侦察员八名在商邱西观音堂截获蒋军汽车两辆，随即用以运兵奇袭商邱东南十五里周堂伪镇公所获胜。二十五日，扶沟游击队员四人，在某村被扶沟伪保安大队张逆国荣部百余人包围，他们坚守村屋，激战四昼夜，终于胜利突围，共击毙伪军二十余名，并将伪匪头子张逆国荣击毙，缴获长短枪六支。又据此次鄄城歼灭战中被俘蒋军军官谈：蒋军此次北犯，在经过荷泽以北二十里之新集一带时，由于民兵游击队活跃，使蒋军日夜不宁，惊慌不安。据极不完全统计：十月份中共毙伤蒋伪千余人，俘四百二十六人，缴机枪七挺，长短枪三百二十六支，汽车六辆，粮食二万六千斤，其他军火资财无算。
    【又电】在冀鲁豫蒋军侵占区内，蒋军建立区、乡政权的企图，在该地民主政府领导地方武装、民兵及广大人民的英勇抗击下，遭受严重打击，已完全失败。当前月蒋军侵占鲁西南荷泽、曹县等地后，立即利用过去的伪军、汉奸及解放区的逃亡恶霸地主等，组织“武装还乡团”，叫他们回乡去建立区乡政权，以扩大其统治地区，达到彻底消灭解放区的目的。我解放区军民洞悉其奸，遂在“把顽匪封锁在死城里”的口号下，对蒋记区乡政权及“还乡团”展开了全面的抗击。九月二十三日，荷泽青邱区区长张自立和民兵队长王登伦带领民兵数人，夜袭王浩屯，将蒋特李心言活捉，于第二日召开群众大会公审枪决。二十五日，东明一区张区长亦带领民兵数人，将孙起寨还乡团长孙黑子击毙。二十七日，我民兵游击队一部，在曹县安仁集，将顽区长兼还乡团长李效贞一齐枪毙。十月九日，我考城独立营夜袭郭小湖，将顽乡长郭茂林击毙，并打伤蒋特郭兰香。由于我民兵游击队积极活动，现使这些地区的蒋记政权始终不能建立。在顽区乡政权已经建立起来的地方，我地方武装及民兵则集中优势力量，将其逐跑或一举歼灭。九月十九日，我齐滨大队将大杨口顽乡公所驱逐，缴获粮食一部。二十日，我东垣大队将住竹林之长垣保警大队及区部全部击溃，击毙五名，生俘医生一名。二十五日夜，华山地方武装，将砀山城北之北康乡公所全部消灭，俘人枪各八。二十六日，我曹县民兵亦在王店南将顽三区区公所及还乡队全部歼灭，击毙一名，俘入枪各十。十月五日，我曹县大队在曹县西北五十余里之范胡同，将顽二区区部击溃，击毙二人，生俘四名，缴枪七支。同日，我深入汶上集一带之游击队，解决南鲁集顽乡公所，俘三十余人，缴麦子数千斤。八日，我荷泽平陵、临河、干元三区民兵联合起来，将郭庄寨区部赶跑，活捉顽区部人员数名，缴麦子三千斤，棉花两大车。在我地方武装及民兵这样连续不断的歼灭下，大部分刚树立起来的蒋政权，在立足未稳之际，就被消灭了。对于城里及少数孤立据点里的蒋记政权，因有蒋军驻扎，一时不能消灭，我民主政府便领导地方武装及民兵，对它进行了严格的封锁、围困，使其不能外出。九月二十四、二十五两日，我沛铜民兵在沛县城郊活捉还乡队三名，击毙二名，缴大米三大车。二十六日，又活捉顽县政府伙夫一名，区部通讯员一名，得马步枪各一支。十月五日，我曹县民兵在定曹公路上，活捉顽区部工作员二名，得手枪一支。十月八日，我临泽六区队在吕庄，活捉顽区部摧粮人员刘自立等数名。因之，使困坐在据点里的顽政工人员，再也不敢外出。在我民主政府领导地方武装及民兵的英勇抗击下，蒋记区乡政权的建立企图已完全失败了，广大村镇仍然在我民主政府的掌握中，人民过着自由的生活。
