　　Model Cadre of the First Rank in the Jinan Mass Movement
    Zhang Tingjun Assassinated by Chiang Kai-shek's Agents
    Administrative Office Holds Solemn Memorial Service Vowing Revenge
    [Our newspaper, Weixian, 1st dispatch] Comrade Zhang Tingjun, Chief of the General Affairs Section of the Jinan Administrative Office, in order to help the peasants to stand up and realize "land to the tiller," voluntarily joined the turnaround team and led the peasants in the second district of Xiajin to wage a relentless struggle against landlords and local bullies. Because of his practical work, in-depth investigation and research, and the leadership style of being bold, letting go, and trusting the masses, he was elected as a first-class model cadre and won the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of peasants. Precisely because he was enthusiastic about the cause of the peasants' turnaround, he aroused the jealousy of reactionary landlords and secret agents. In late October, he was brutally assassinated by Chiang Kai-shek's agents at a mass suffering complaint meeting in Xu Lichang Village, Second District! When the news came out, cadres at the administrative office level and local masses were all grieved and indignant. In order to carry forward Comrade Tingjun's fine style and implement the mass movement, eliminate secret agents, defeat Chiang Kai-shek the elder, and defeat Chiang Kai-shek the younger, and to avenge Comrade Tingjun, the administrative office held a solemn memorial service on October 28th. More than 500 people attended the meeting, including cadres from the District Party Committee, the military region, and various organs and groups. After the dirge was played, Director Meng's wife, Tang Xiang, paid homage to the martyr by offering incense and wine. He solemnly called on cadres at all levels to avenge those who died for their work achievements! The peasants who have turned around in the new district should quickly conduct a major inspection, clean up the fruits, consolidate and expand the organization, develop the militia, and stop the counterattack of the evil landlords; urgently mobilize, support the front line, defeat the attack of "Chiang Kai-shek the elder," and defend their homes and land; the old district should carry out investigation and rent reduction, and implement leveling and making up differences to thoroughly solve the peasants' land problem. Deputy Director Wang walked to the spiritual platform in tears and said, "Comrade Tingjun asked to join the Communist Party before he left. He had the spirit of sacrificing everything for the revolution. The District Party Committee has approved him as an outstanding Communist Party member." Finally, he emphasized, "The struggle is cruel, we should be highly vigilant, strengthen our work, and strive to implement Comrade Tingjun's will!" In addition to expressing condolences to Comrade Tingjun, the representative of the military region pledged on behalf of all commanders and fighters in the region to use all their strength to defeat Chiang Kai-shek, defend the people's turnaround interests, and avenge Comrade Tingjun. Then, Comrade Tingjun's father walked to the spiritual platform. His grief turned into a roar. He said, "Tingjun died for the people, this is glorious! I only ask comrades to work hard, overthrow the reactionary landlords, defeat Chiang Kai-shek the elder, eliminate the secret agents, avenge him! Avenge the compatriots who were slaughtered by the Kuomintang secret agents!" (Da Wei)
