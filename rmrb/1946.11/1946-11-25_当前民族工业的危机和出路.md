　　The Crisis and Way Out for National Industry
    Liao Gailong Huang Yao
    In his book "China's Destiny," published in March 1943, Chiang Kai-shek declared that "the real beginning of national construction work... takes 'industrialization' as the most urgent task." In the book, he specifically formulated a "ten-year plan" to industrialize China. Chiang Kai-shek issued this "industrialization" check three and a half years ago, and one-third of the time for his "ten-year plan" has passed. But what is the reality? Just look at the facts of the past year since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War!
    In the past year, in Chiang Kai-shek's ruling area, not only has there been no "industrialization," but even the original national industry has been on the verge of total bankruptcy. In the Great Rear Area, the original industrial system "has disintegrated by 80%" (see Wu Chengxi's paper in the Shanghai Economic Weekly on September 12). In the so-called "recovered areas," taking Shanghai as an example, "of the original 3,419 private factories, 2,597 have closed down, accounting for 75% of the total; of the original 636 state-owned factories, 566 have closed down, accounting for 89%; the total number of private and state-owned factories was 4,055, of which 3,160 have closed down, accounting for 78%" (Chongqing Xinhua Daily).
    Tens of thousands of ordinary people have been pushed to the desperate end of starvation and unemployment. According to the records of six newspapers, there are 790,000 unemployed people in Peiping, accounting for about 50% of the city's population. The unemployed population in Qingdao, Jinan, and Nanjing is more than one-third. The unemployed and jobless population in Shanghai also exceeds 40%. Among them, industrial workers account for 300,000, which is more than one-third of the original 800,000 industrial workers in Shanghai.
    The facts fully prove that Chiang Kai-shek not only will never have the power to solve the major historical task of China's industrialization, but also cannot even maintain the little bit of national industry that exists. Under Chiang Kai-shek's rule, there is only a dead end for national industry. Why is this? Why is the current national industry in such a severe crisis?
    The main cause of this crisis is the invasion of American imperialist commodities and capital. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, cheap American goods poured into our country, forming an "international torrent" (as Shanghai textile industrialist Pan Shihao put it) that submerged our national industry. Because the cost price of American goods is several times lower than that of our products, national industries have collapsed one after another. As long as any kind of American goods are imported, the corresponding industrial sector will inevitably collapse immediately. For example, the selling price of American cement in Shanghai is only more than 7,000 yuan per bag in legal currency, while the cost of domestic cement is 14,000 yuan per bag. Even if it is sold at a loss at a low price of 8,000 yuan per bag, it still cannot be sold, and the Shanghai cement factory immediately collapsed completely. For another example, as a result of the dumping of cheap American cigarettes in various places, most cigarette factories in Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Shaoguan, Chongqing, Chengdu, Tianjin, and other places have closed down. On the other hand, American monopoly capital has begun to directly invest or set up factories in China's land, sea, and air transportation industries and hardware, petroleum, and electrical industries, which will further force our national industry to complete death.
    I still remember that from 1935 to 1937, the dumping and smuggling of Japanese goods caused a major crisis in China's national industry. However, the Chinese industrial crisis caused by American aggression in the past year is even more serious than that time. For example, in Shanghai, in the year before the Anti-Japanese War (from June 1936 to May of the following year), that is, the year when Japanese political and economic aggression was the most intense, only 111 factories of various types closed down, and there were still 49 newly opened factories in the same year. However, after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, 3,160 factories in Shanghai have closed down in the past year, and there are absolutely no newly opened factories. The reason why the threat of American aggression to China's national industry is even greater than that of Japan is not only because the United States has higher industrial technology and greater economic aggression power than Japan, but also because Japan's "Sino-Japanese economic cooperation" plan had not been successfully realized due to the resistance of the Chinese people; but now American imperialism has obtained the complete "cooperation" of Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang.
    In the past year, in order to obtain excessive comprador profits, Chiang Kai-shek's bureaucratic capital group has organized large companies such as Yangtze, Jianye, Changjiang, Fuzhong, and China, which monopolize import and export trade, to promote American goods and directly serve American imperialism's export of goods to China. Not only that, but because Chiang Kai-shek wants to rely on the "aid" of American imperialism to carry out the civil war, he does not hesitate to promulgate the sale of customs, territorial seas, inland rivers, and airspace rights, and does not hesitate to promulgate the new company law that introduces aggressive capital, completely destroying the barriers of China's national economy and completely placing China in the position of a dependency of American imperialism. Moreover, even such strange things have happened: China can originally produce woolen fabrics, cotton cloth, cotton, cement, leather, crude alcohol, silkworm cocoons, coal, etc., but Chiang Kai-shek's group does not want to buy these "native goods," but orders them in large quantities from the United States and Japan under its control, and as a result, these national industries and craft agriculture have collapsed. As Shanghai financier Zhang [illegible character] said, the true face of Chiang Kai-shek's bureaucratic capital is "to be the vanguard of the economic aggressors of imperialism."
    The truth about the crisis of national industry is as described above, and Chinese industrialists cannot but fight for the right to survive together with the Chinese people. At a gathering on July 18, Shanghai industrialists demanded that the highest authorities "change what is not like a national government into what is like a national government." In July, at a meeting in Chongqing where economic circles received Economic Department Commissioner Wu Chengluo, the famous electrical industryist Hu Xiyuan demanded that Song Ziwen "change his mind." Construction Department Director He Beiheng, a giant in the industry, also stated: "I hope that the Nanjing government will change its attitude of fearing foreigners and hating Chinese when dealing with industrial issues" (Shanghai Millard's Review). Indeed, Chiang Kai-shek also tried to take some minor measures, such as the so-called raising of foreign exchange on August 19, to ease the dissatisfaction and resistance of the industrial circles, but Chiang Kai-shek was determined not to and dared not change "his attitude of fearing foreigners and hating Chinese." The "qualified person" of the Economic Department of the Chiang government said to the representatives of the Shanghai industrial and commercial delegation: "Protective tariffs cannot be adopted for foreign exchange, and it is difficult to thoroughly adjust them, because we are afraid of arousing the dissatisfaction of 'friendly nations'." This is the self-confession of the running dogs of the American aggressors who are determined to allow the bankruptcy of national industry. In fact, since the so-called increase in foreign exchange, the disaster of national industry has only deepened day by day, so the Chinese industrial circles' opposition to aggression and betrayal of the country has inevitably increased. The Shanghai ten people's organizations and industrial and commercial circles unanimously passed the resolution of "opposing American economic aggression against China," "overthrowing the new traitors who collude with the American reactionaries regardless of national interests," and "overthrowing bureaucratic comprador capital" at the sixth congress of the "American Troops Withdraw from China Week" held on the 28th of last month. This is a new manifestation of the rising national indignation.
    Today, the Chinese industrial circles have seen very clearly that China's industrialization and political democratization are inseparable. Only by getting rid of the shackles of imperialism, reorganizing the evil government of the traitorous dictatorship, and establishing an independent, democratic, and peaceful new China can the industrial crisis be saved, can the historical task of China's industrialization be solved, and can the liberated areas be liberated. The liberated areas are precisely the prototype of such a new China. Here, we do not know what the industrial crisis is. Private capital here is fully encouraged and supported by the government. At present, many industrialists have gradually understood the truth about the liberated areas through the Kuomintang's blockade, and expressed their sincere admiration for the liberated areas. Some capitalists have even directly invested in the liberated areas or founded factories. Because of this, the Chinese industrial circles cannot but place their hopes on the victory of the patriotic self-defense war in the liberated areas.

　　当前民族工业的危机和出路
    廖盖隆　黄药
    蒋介石在一九四三年三月出版的“中国之命运”一书中，曾宣告“建国工作真正的开始………………………………尤以‘工业化’为当务之急”。在该书中，他并具体地制订了一个使中国工业化的“十年计划”。蒋介石开出这张“工业化”的支票已经三年半了，他的“十年计划”的时间亦已过去了三分之一，但事实怎样呢？就请看抗战胜利以后一年来的事实吧！
    这一年来，在蒋介石的统治区，不但没有什么“工业化”，而且连原有的一点民族工业也陷于总破产的边沿。在大后方，原有的工业体系，“是百分之八十的瓦解了”（见九月十二日上海经济周刊吴承禧氏论文）。在所谓“收复区”，以上海为例，该地“原有民营工厂三千四百一十九家，倒闭了二千五百九十七家，占全数百分之七十五；原有国营工厂六百三十六家，已倒闭五百六十六家，占百分之八十九；民营、国营合计原有四千零五十五家，已倒闭三千一百六十家，占百分之七十八”（重庆新华日报）。
    成千累万的老百姓陷于饥饿失业的绝路，失业人数据六家报纸的记载，北平是七十九万人，约占全市人口百分之五十，青岛、济南、南京失业人口在三分之一以上，上海失业和无业的人口亦超过十分之四。其中原来的产业工人，失业者占三十万，超过上海原有八十万产业工人的三分之一。
    事实完全证明了蒋介石不但永远没有力量解决中国工业化这一重大的历史课题，而且即欲维持仅有的一点民族工业亦不可得，在蒋介石的统治下，民族工业只有死路一条。这是为什么，为什么目前民族工业会陷于如此剧烈的危机？
    造成这一危机的主要症结，就是美国帝国主义商品和资本的侵略。抗战胜利以后，廉价的美国货滚滚侵入我国，形成了淹没我国民族工业的“国际狂流”（上海染织业家潘士浩语）。由于美货的成本价格低于我国产品数倍，因此民族工业纷纷倒台，只要有什么样的美货进口，什么样的工业部门就必然立刻垮下去。比如美国水泥在上海的售价每包法币仅七千余元，国产水泥每包单成本就要一万四千元，以每包八千元的低价亏本出售仍卖不出，上海的水泥厂随即完全垮台。又如廉价的美国香烟倾销各地的结果，上海、南京、广州、韶关、重庆、成都、天津等地，大部分卷烟工厂均已倒歇。另一方面，美国垄断资本已开始在我国海陆空交通事业和五金、石油、电汽等事业中直接投资或设厂，将更迫我民族工业于完全死亡。
    犹忆一九三五到三七年，日货倾销与走私的结果，曾造成中国民族工业的大危机。但一年来美国侵略所造成的中国工业危机，较之那时还要严重得多。比如上海，在抗战前一年（一九三六年六月到次年五月），也即日寇政治、经济侵略最烈的一年，各种工厂之倒歇者尚仅一百一十一家，而且同年新开设的工厂还有四十九家。但抗战胜利后，一年来上海工厂却倒闭了三千一百六十家，至于新开设的工厂则绝无仅有。美国侵略对中国民族工业的威胁之所以更甚于日本，不仅因为美国较之日本有更高的工业技术与更大的经济侵略力量，而且最主要的是因为当时日本的“中日经济提携”计划，因遇到中国人民的抵抗，还没有圆满实现；但现在美帝国主义却得到蒋介石国民党的完全的“合作”。
    一年来，蒋介石官僚资本集团为了获得超额的买办利润，组织了扬子、建业、长江、阜中、中国等垄断进出口贸易的大公司来推销美国货，直接为美帝国主义的对华输出商品服务。不但如此，蒋介石因为要倚赖美帝国主义的“援助”来进行内战，不惜颁布出卖海关、领海、内河与领空权，不惜颁布引进侵略资本的新公司法，完全摧毁了中国民族经济的壁垒，完全置中国于美帝国主义的附庸地位。而且，甚至发生了这样的怪事：中国本来能生产毛织品、棉布、棉花、水泥、皮革、酒粗、蚕茧、煤炭等等，但蒋介石集团不要买这些“土货”，却向美国及其控制下的日本大量订购，结果这些民族工业及工艺农业就垮台了。正如上海金融家张＠伯氏所说的，现在蒋介石官僚资本的真面目，就是“做帝国主义经济侵略者的先锋”。
    民族工业危机的真相即如上述，中国实业界便不能不和中国人民一起，为着生存的权利而抗争。上海实业界在七月十八日的集会中，曾要求最高当局“要把不像国家政府做的事，变为像国家政府做的事”。在七月间，重庆经济界招待经济部特派员吴承洛的会上，著名电汽工业家胡西园氏曾要求宋子文“改变脑筋”。实业巨子建设厅长何北衡也表示：“希望南京政府在处理工业问题时，要改变它那惧洋仇华的态度”（上海密勒氏评论报）。诚然，蒋介石也试图过采取些枝节措施，如八月十九日所谓的提高外汇之类用以缓和实业界的不满和抗争，但是蒋介石却决不愿也不敢改变“他那惧洋仇华的态度”。蒋政府经济部的“有资格人士”对上海工商界请愿团的代表说过：“保护关税不能采取外汇，亦决难彻底调整，因恐引起‘友邦’不满也。”这就是美国侵略者的走狗们决心任使民族工业破产的自供。事实上，自所谓提高外汇之后，民族工业的灾难只有日益加深，因此中国实业界反对侵略、反对卖国的必然更加增长起来。上海十人民团体与工商界，在上月二十八日举行的“美军退出中国周”的第六日大会上，一致通过了“反对美国经济侵华”、“打倒不顾民族利益，勾结美国反动派的新汉奸”、“打倒官僚买办资本”的决议，便是这种民族义愤高涨的新显现。
    在今天，中国实业界已经看得很清楚，中国工业化和政治民主化是不可分离的了，只有摆脱帝国主义的羁绊，改组卖国贼专政的恶政府，建立独立民主和平的新中国，才能挽救工业的危机，才能解决中国工业化的历史任务，解放区恰恰就是这样的新中国的雏型。这里不知道工业危机为何物，这里的私人资本受到政府的全力鼓励和扶助，目前许多实业家由于逐渐透过国民党的封锁了解了解放区的真象，而表示对解放区的衷心倾慕，有些资本家并且已经直接向解放区投资或创办工厂了。就因为这样，中国实业界不能不把自己的希望寄托于解放区爱国的自卫战争的胜利上。
