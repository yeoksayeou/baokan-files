　　Taihang Third Military Sub-district Directly Subordinate Team Conducts Ideological Examination
    [This newspaper, Changzhi dispatch] After studying the Central Committee's instructions on the current situation and the *Liberation Daily*'s editorial "On the War Situation," all cadres of the Directly Subordinate Team of the Taihang Third Military Sub-district became much more clear-headed. They actively responded to Director Wang of the Political Department's call to "concentrate energy on the struggle against the enemy, put down personal ideological burdens and material burdens, and undertake the great task of defending the Party and the Chinese people," and launched an ideological examination. They unanimously agreed: "The reactionaries have already put the knife to our necks, what personal problems are there to fuss about?" In order to thoroughly put down material burdens, all comrades registered their private property, and all illegal money (such as public funds borrowed from the bank in the name of the group, or dividends earned from personal production using the unit's funds, etc.) were handed over. After everyone's discussion, it was awarded to comrades who worked actively and had no private savings, as a fund for establishing revolutionary households for personal production. It was also decided that in the future, anyone who has private savings must go through the Economic Committee for assistance in buying shares to develop legitimate production, and not be allowed to waste it casually. After such an ideological examination and clarification of personal material burdens, the working enthusiasm of all comrades suddenly increased, mutual relations became harmonious, and the concept of obeying organizational decisions was strengthened. They unanimously expressed their determination to resolutely complete the posts and tasks assigned by the Party, and to fight to the end to win a complete victory in resistance and counter-offensive.

　　太行三分区直属队进行思想检查
    【本报长治讯】太行三分区直属队全体干部，研究了中央对时局指示与解放日报“论战局”社论后，头脑大为清醒，纷纷响应政治部王主任“把精力集中到对敌斗争上，放下个人思想包袱与物质包袱，担负起保卫党和中国人民的伟大任务”的号召展开思想检查，一致认为：“反动派已把刀子放在咱们脖子上了，还有什么私人问题可闹？”为了彻底放下物质包袱，全体同志都进行了私人财产登记，把不合法的金钱（如以团体身份到银行借出公款或以本单位的基金进行个人生产赚来的红利等），均全部缴出，由大家评议奖给工作积极，没有私人积蓄的同志，做为个人生产建立革命家务的基金。并决定今后谁有了私人积蓄，均要通过经委会的帮助入股，发展正当的生产，不准随便浪费。经过这样思想检查与澄清个人物质包袱后，全体同志工作情绪顿显高涨，相互关系融洽，服从组织决定的观念增强，一致表示坚决完成党给予的岗位和任务，为争取全面抵抗与反攻胜利斗争到底。（孙祝三）
