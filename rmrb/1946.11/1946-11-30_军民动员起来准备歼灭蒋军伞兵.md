The General Staff of the Yan'an Headquarters recently published an article entitled "How to Deal with Paratroopers." It is hoped that this document will be disseminated and discussed by all armies and guerrilla units. It is particularly important that Party committees, governments at all levels, and mass organizations should disseminate and discuss it among local militias, the masses, and staff members. (This document can be found on page 3 of today's newspaper.)

In order to attack the Liberated Areas, Chiang Kai-shek has completely used up all the capital he has accumulated in the past three or four years. Up to now, 38 brigades of his army have been annihilated by our army (Note: According to a Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Yan'an on the 24th, it has reached 40 brigades. See page 1 of this newspaper on November 27th). This time, Chiang Kai-shek is determined to use his paratroopers to attack Yan'an and the Border Region. Chiang Kai-shek uses this trick to scare people.

In fact, paratroopers are not very effective in terrain like that of Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia. If we add one more condition, that is, if all the people in the entire Border Region know how to deal with paratroopers, then they will definitely be unable to come and go, and will all be annihilated in the Border Region!

Paratroopers have many weaknesses. First, after jumping, the paratroopers are unconscious for a few minutes. Even women and old men can kill them with stones and sticks. Moreover, when the paratroopers land, even if the enemy has aircraft cover, they dare not strafe, because they are afraid of hurting their own people. Second, after the paratroopers land and regain consciousness, they have to assemble. This is a very chaotic time and it is easy for us to kill and eliminate them. Third, after the paratroopers gather, if they fail to seize the airport, Chiang Kai-shek's transport planes cannot land, there are no reinforcements and no supplies, and they will be wiped out sooner or later.

With these three fatal weaknesses of the paratroopers, it is easy for us to deal with them. To deal with paratroopers, the main thing is that all the military and civilians must be prepared, control all the open space in the entire Border Region, place obstacles in places where transport planes may land, set up guard posts and paratrooper alarms, and prepare various weapons, even sticks and stones, one for each person, and conduct exercises. When Chiang Kai-shek's paratroopers arrive, men, women, old and young, should immediately go out and try to kill the unconscious paratroopers. Then, it will be easy to eliminate the remaining paratroopers.

As for the principles for the army and guerrillas to deal with paratroopers, the General Staff's document has explained it in detail. It should be carefully discussed, prepared, and implemented accordingly.

In short, we are fully confident of completely eliminating Chiang Kai-shek's paratroopers. It is hoped that the military and civilians in all regions will discuss the Yan'an Headquarters General Staff's article "How to Deal with Paratroopers" and immediately make full preparations. It is particularly important that the militia and all the people must be mobilized, and Party, government, military and civilian organizations must immediately make specific plans, and inspect and supervise.

### 军民动员起来准备歼灭蒋军伞兵

　　军民动员起来准备歼灭蒋军伞兵
    延安总部参谋处于最近发表了《怎样对付伞兵》一文，这个文件望各军队各游击队都进行传达和发动讨论。特别重要的是各级党委政府及民众组织，应当在各地民兵和民众中以及工作人员中进行传达与讨论。（这个文件见今日本报第三版）
    蒋介石为了进攻解放区，把他三四年所积聚的一点本钱完全用上来了。到了现在，其军队已被我军消灭了卅八个旅；（按：据新华社延安二十四日电，已达四十个旅。见十一月二十七日本报第一版。）此次进攻延安和边区，蒋介石决心用他的伞兵。蒋介石使用这个玩意儿，其目的是想吓人。
    实际上伞兵用在陕甘宁这样的地形上，作用是并不大的。如果再加上一个条件，即是全边区人民都知道了对付伞兵的方法，那他们就一定来得去不得，全部被歼灭在边区里！
    伞兵的弱点是很多的。第一，跳落之后，有几分钟伞兵是昏迷的，那怕女人老汉，只有石头木棍就可以打死他。而且在伞兵落地的时候，即使敌人有飞机掩护，也不敢扫射，因为怕伤了他们自己的人。第二，伞兵落下和苏醒之后，还要去集结。这就有一个时候很混乱，容易被我杀伤和消灭。第三，伞兵聚结之后，如果抢不到飞机场，蒋军的运输机不能降落，没有援兵没有接济，就迟早要被消灭干净。
    伞兵有这三个致命的弱点，我们就容易对付它。对付伞兵，主要的要全体军民都有准备，控制全边区所有的开阔地，在可能降落运输机的地方，都放上障碍物，设置守望哨和伞兵警报，准备各种武器，直至木棍石块，每人均有一件，进行演习。在蒋介石伞兵到来时，男女老幼一齐立刻出动，把昏迷的伞兵尽量打死。然后，其余伞兵的消灭就很容易。
    至于军队与游击队对付伞兵的原则，参谋处的文件已说得很详细，应该仔细讨论，进行准备，并照此施行。
    总之，我们是完全有把握把蒋介石的伞兵干脆消灭的。望各地军民讨论延安总部参谋处的“怎样对付伞兵”一文，并立即进行充分的准备。特别重要的是，民兵与全体民众必须动员起来，党政军民各机关要立即具体计划与检查督促。
