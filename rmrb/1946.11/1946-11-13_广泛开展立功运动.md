    Broadly Launch the Meritorious Service Movement
    Liberation Daily Short Commentary
    The Shandong and Central China liberated areas are launching a meritorious service movement for the people, calling on everyone to establish merit in the self-defense war, record the deeds of heroes and models in the merit book, and create a upsurge of "reporting merits, rewarding merits, and awarding merits" and "every people's hero is respected." This is a groundbreaking initiative in the people's self-defense war. To establish merit for the people and become a meritorious servant of the people is the greatest glory for a revolutionary fighter and the greatest contribution to the people. It should be greatly promoted and popularized.
    In promoting this movement, the Party, government, army, and people must enthusiastically engage in revolutionary heroism competitions, enhance the spirit of serving the people and self-sacrifice, become familiar with and master various weapons, improve technical levels and work efficiency, and strengthen combat effectiveness. At the same time, it is necessary to promote unity, fraternity, and a spirit of humbly learning. The slogan proposed by a certain regiment of the New Fourth Army in Central China, "Don't be arrogant when you have made achievements, add achievements on top of achievements," is very good! We call on all liberated areas to universally launch this movement as a weapon to win the victory of the overall resistance.

    广泛开展立功运动
    解放日报短评
    山东和华中解放区正在开展为人民立功运动，号召每个人在自卫战争中建立功劳，将英雄模范事迹，记入功劳簿，掀起了有功报功论功行赏”“人民功臣个个尊敬”的立功热潮。这是人民自卫战争中的一个创举，为人民立功劳，作人民的功臣，这是一个革命战士的最大光荣，也是对人民的最大贡献，应当大大提倡和推广。
    在推行这个运动时，无论党政军民要热烈进行革命英雄主义的竞赛，提高一切为人民服务自我牺牲的精神，熟悉与掌握各种武器，提高技术水平与工作效率加强战斗力，同时要发扬团结友爱。虚心学习的精神。华中新四军某团所提“有了功劳不骄傲，功劳上面加功劳”的口号是很好的！我们号召全解放区普遍，开展这一运动，作为争取全面抵抗的胜利武器。
