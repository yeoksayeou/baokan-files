　　[This report from our newspaper in Weixian, dated the 30th] After a thorough review following their liberation, Yuan Dynasty County is deeply engaged in the land leveling and compensation campaign to implement the "land to the tiller" policy. In the past half-month, the movement has spread to all villages in the county and has now reached the stage of distributing the fruits [of the struggle] and reorganizing the organizations. In eight villages of the Zhangba Township in the seventh district, fifteen landlords, twenty-nine exploitative landlords and feudal rich peasants were investigated in five days, recovering 9.59 *qing* of land, twenty-two head of cattle and donkeys, and nineteen carts. In the first district, after the land leveling and compensation campaign in forty villages, much land that was hidden by feudal landlords through means such as fake mortgages, fake sales, gifts, and debt offsets has been exposed and returned to the peasants. In the fifth and sixth districts, some landlords who were close relatives of village cadres, or who had sentimental ties with village cadres, and who had previously oppressed the masses, have now been overthrown. The land donation movement of party members, cadres, and enlightened landlords who are family members of revolutionary martyrs is a tributary of this movement. Hao Jingui, the Finance Chief of Linzhang, donated 24 *mu* of land, eight rooms, and a vacant courtyard… Ma Guoying, an enlightened landlord in Qianpuming Township, donated a vacant courtyard, eight rooms, one hundred cypress trees… These acts of donating land have been praised by the peasants. Recently, the County Party Committee issued instructions to all districts, pointing out: (1) In some villages, there are phenomena of village cadres and militiamen eating and drinking extravagantly with the fruits [of the struggle], awarding prizes to militiamen at will without the consent of the masses, and the village government using valuable furniture from the fruits [of the struggle]. In the future, a comprehensive inspection and correction should be carried out in villages where the fruits [of the struggle] have already been distributed, and these phenomena must be resolutely prevented in villages where the fruits [of the struggle] have not yet been distributed, deeply mobilizing village cadres and militiamen to ensure that the fruits [of the struggle] are distributed to the broad masses of peasants. (2) After implementing "land leveling and compensation" and all peasants have obtained land, it is necessary to quickly reorganize the organizations, conduct patriotic self-defense education, establish a democratic style within the masses, and shift to production.

    【本报威县三十日电】元朝县经过翻身大检查后，深入开展填平补齐运动，以贯彻耕者有其田，半月来，运动已普及全县各村庄，现已达分配果实、整理组织阶段。七区丈八小区八个村、五天内清算了地主十五户、经营地主及封建富农二十九户，追回土地九顷五十九亩、牛驴二十二头、大车十九辆。一区四十个村经过填平补齐运动，过去封建地主以假当、假卖、赠送、挡账等方式、分散隐蔽的很多土地，都已被揭发并归还农民。五、六区有些与村干近族的地主，或与村干有感情的地主，过去压在群众头上，现已被打下台来。党员、干部、抗属开明地主的献田运动，是这次运动的支流，临漳财经科长郝金桂献田二十四亩，房八间、闲院一处……。前普明町开明地主马国英，献闲院一处，房子八间、柏树百株……。这些献田义举，都得到农民赞扬。最近县委又向各区发出指示，指出：（一）、有些村庄存在着村干、民兵用果实大吃大喝，不经群众同意，民兵随便提奖，村公所使用果实中之贵重家具的现象，今后要在已分果实村庄，普遍检查纠正，尚未分果实村庄，要坚决防止这些现象发生，深入动员村干部民兵，保证将果实分到广大农民手中。（二）、实行“填平补齐”，农民都得到土地后，要迅速整理组织，进行爱国自卫教育，树立群众内部的民主作风，转入生产。
