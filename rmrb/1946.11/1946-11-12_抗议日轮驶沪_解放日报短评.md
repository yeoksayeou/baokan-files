    Protesting the Japanese Ship Sailing to Shanghai
    *Liberation Daily* Short Commentary
    It has only been a little over a year since the Japanese bandits surrendered, yet a Japanese ship flying the Rising Sun flag has brazenly sailed into the Huangpu River and anchored at will. The Chinese people cannot help but feel extreme indignation towards this Japanese ship's act of infringing upon Chinese sovereignty.

    This ship was designated to come to China by MacArthur. In the past year, the representative of American imperialism, MacArthur, has been reviving the Japanese Emperor and fully supporting the Japanese Zaibatsu in Japan, making them powerful tools for American imperialism to suppress domestic Japanese and Far Eastern national democratic movements. Therefore, he has repeatedly sacrificed Chinese sovereignty and interests, such as fishing rights, exporting raw materials, and importing Japanese goods, to feed his henchmen. Chiang Kai-shek, in order to obtain support from the American government, insists on dictatorship and carries out civil war, obeying MacArthur's every request. It is therefore not surprising that he agreed to the Japanese ship coming to China, allowing the Rising Sun flag to fly over China after the victory of the War of Resistance!

    We express our serious protest against the American reactionaries' instigation of the Japanese Zaibatsu to infringe upon Chinese sovereignty. And we solemnly warn the Chinese and American reactionaries that the blood shed by the Chinese people during the eight years of the War of Resistance must not be shed in vain. They must continue to fight to the end for the complete territorial sovereignty, independence, and freedom of their motherland! And they will surely be victorious in the end.

    抗议日轮驶沪
    解放日报短评
    日寇投降迄今只一年多，而挂着太阳旗的日本轮船，居然又堂而皇之的开进黄浦江来，随意停泊。对于日轮这种侵犯中国主权的行为，中国人民不能不感觉极度的愤慨。
    该日轮是麦克阿瑟指定来华的，一年来美帝国主义的代表人麦克阿瑟在日本的做法，就是重新培育日本天皇与全力扶植日本财阀，使之成为美帝国主义镇压日本国内与远东民族民主运动的有力工具。因此，不惜一再牺牲中国主权和利益，如渔业权，输出原料和输入日货等等，以豢养其鹰犬；而蒋介石为了取得美国政府的支援，坚持独裁，进行内战，对于麦克阿瑟的每一要求，无不唯命是从。此次同意日轮来华，任凭太阳旗招展在抗战胜利后的中国上空，也就不足为奇了！
    我们对于美国反动派怂恿日本财阀侵犯中国主权的行为，表示严正的抗议。并且正告中美反动派，中国人民八年抗战所流的血，决不能白流，他们一定要为争取祖国的领土主权完整与独立自由而继续奋斗到底！而且他们最后一定胜利。
