Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 19th: The canal running through the liberated areas of Central Jiangsu and Northern Jiangsu, having successfully completed the two major projects of spring repair and summer defense, has victoriously weathered this autumn's major floods, resulting in a bumper harvest in twenty-five counties from Central Jiangsu to Yancheng and Funing. The completion of the canal's spring repair project was just in time for the flood season of summer and autumn. The summer defense began on August 1st, with the establishment of flood prevention organizations at all levels to lead the management of the canal. Over a thousand militiamen organized dyke protection teams to patrol day and night, and tens of thousands of people bravely carried out repairs. After August 23rd, the waters of the Yellow River, Huai River, and Hongze Lake all rose simultaneously, converging on this section of the canal, and the water was extremely turbulent. At the same time, the dams returning to the Yangtze River were blocked by the Kuomintang authorities in Yangzhou in violation of agreements and not opened. The water level at the Yumatou area of Gaoyou reached as high as 17.6 chi, comparable to the water level when the Zhongmu breach occurred in 1938, and only two chi lower than the water level during the great flood of 1931, which caused 105 breaches. Moreover, the high water level persisted for 36 days. However, due to effective protection, the danger was eventually averted. By October 6th, when the dyke protection work was completed and the defense was withdrawn, a total of 255 projects had been completed, costing 14.48 million Central China currency (at that time, each yuan was equivalent to 35 legal tender yuan). The main projects included raising the height of the two Southern Guihe dams in Gaoyou, raising the height of the western dyke of Bao Ying, Beizha, and Yaokou for forty li, the emergency construction of 1,200 zhang of stone work on the western dyke of Gaoyou, and the repair of the sections south of Shaobo that were blown up by Chiang's troops. When the flood prevention was lifted, the Flood Prevention Committee also issued salaries and food for October and November to the canal management and flood prevention personnel, instructing them to continue to protect the dykes. Although the towns along the canal are temporarily occupied by Chiang's troops, the water conservancy of the canal, which the people of Jiangsu and Anhui exchanged for with their blood and flesh, will forever belong to the people. Currently, the Huang Yu Guerrilla Team in Huaiyin, the Wan Guolin Guerrilla Team in Jiangdu, the Baotian Team in Huaian, and other people's self-defense armed forces are active on both sides of the canal, igniting the flames of guerrilla warfare and waging a resolute struggle against the invading troops.

　　华中完成运河抢修
    战胜秋泛二十五县丰收
    现人民武装纷起保卫水利
    【新华社华中十九日电】纵贯苏中苏北解放区之运河，在完成春修夏防两大工程后，胜利渡过今秋大泛，苏中至盐阜一带二十五县，因之获得丰收。该段运河春修工程的完成，正好赶上夏秋大水的泛期。八月一日即开始夏防，先后成立各级防泛机构领导治运，千余民兵组织护堤大队昼夜巡逻，成万群众英勇进行抢修。八月二十三日以后，黄、淮、湖、（洪泽）诸水并涨，汇集该段，运河水势极为凶猛，同时归江各坝，又遭扬州国民党当局违犯协议堵塞不予启放，至高邮御码头一带水位高达一丈七尺六寸，与民国二十七年中牟缺口时之水位相彷，较之民国二十年倒决一○五处的大水灾时水位仅低二尺，且经久不退；危险期达三十六天，但因防护得法，终于化险为夷。至十月六日，护堤工毕撤防时，共做工程二百五十五段，用费达华中币一千四百八十万元（当时每元合法币三十五元）。其中主要工程有高邮南归河二坝的加高，宝应、北闸、窑口四十里之西堤加高，高邮西堤一千二百丈石工的抢筑，及邵伯以南为蒋军炸掘段的修建等。待防泛撤消时，防委会还发给治运防泛员工以十、十一两月薪粮，责成其继续护堤。现运河沿岸城镇虽然暂为蒋军侵占，但苏皖人民用血肉换来的运河水利将永远属于人民。现淮阴之黄驭游击队，江都之万国林游击队，淮安之保田队等人民自卫武装正活跃于运河两岸，掀起游击战烽火与进犯军展开坚决斗争。
