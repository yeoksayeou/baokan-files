　　[This article is from:] Our Yangcheng dispatch on the 28th: After the Yan Xishan army suffered devastating blows from the Eighth Route Army on the Datong-Puzhou front, it began to indiscriminately draft laborers in the Pingyao and Jiexiu areas. Anyone capable of wielding a weapon, regardless of age, weakness, or physical defects, was not spared. In Jiexiu alone, over a thousand laborers were drafted.
