    Tian Si'er Leads in Defending the Fruits of Liberation
    Nantian Militia Deters Yan's Puppet Troops
    Taihang Military Commission Issues Commendation
    [This Newspaper's Report] This month on the 10th, the Taihang Military Commission specially issued a circular commending the Nantian Militia of Yuci. The circular stated: Since its establishment in August of last year, the Nantian Militia, under the leadership of Tian Si'er and Liu Zhuanwen, has resolutely protected the village and struck at the invading Yan's puppet troops, achieving glorious results. Especially since September of this year, the flexible mobile mine warfare combined with sniper warfare has killed three of Yan's puppet troops (including one company commander) and wounded sixteen, becoming a model banner for explosive warfare in the border area of Yuci. In addition to the circular of commendation, the Military Commission also awarded 50 landmines to encourage them to continue expanding their war results.
    According to reports: The small village of Nantian is only one *li* away from ten of Yan's puppet strongholds. After liberation last autumn, under the leadership of the government, the great bully ×× was overthrown. Tian Si'er and twelve young people, including veteran Liu Zhuanwen, organized a militia to protect the masses' liberation interests and formed a joint defense with the militias of Beitian, Tianjiao, and other villages to support each other in combat. Over the past year, they have captured 20 Yan's puppet soldiers and secret agents, killed 19, seized 4 rifles and 1 machine gun, and defeated countless enemy activities such as flooding the village, and looting grain and seizing conscripts. Since September of this year, "Homecoming Legions" and "Revenge Teams" have launched even more frantic attacks, attempting to destroy Nantian. They organized the entire village to evacuate, moving the old and weak to safe areas, and planting landmines inside and outside the village. The militia persisted in the village. When there was no enemy situation, they rang the bell to call the masses back to the village for production. As soon as there was an enemy situation, they covered the masses' retreat and jointly attacked the enemy with the joint defense militia. On September 8, more than 40 members of the "Revenge Team," taking advantage of the rainy weather and assuming that the masses and militia would not be prepared, invaded Nantian. However, they were detected, and four landmines were planted on their route. Before the enemy even entered the village, their company commander and two others were killed. Taking advantage of the "Revenge Team's" confusion, they concentrated fire and fiercely shot at them, repelling them and wounding eleven in addition to the three killed. On the 9th, more than 80 of Yan's puppet troops went to Beitian to rob grain. Tian Si'er led the militia to support them in three ways, rushing straight into Beitian, intercepting one cart, two mules, and more than ten *shi* of wheat, and wounding one of Yan's puppet troops. On October 10, Tian and others used flying mines to explode continuously, killing and wounding four of Yan's puppet troops. Since September, they have fought a total of six battles, detonating six landmines, killing 19 of Yan's puppet troops (including one company commander), terrifying Yan's puppet troops to the point where they dare not easily go to Nantian to rob grain. When they come out, the officers repeatedly tell the soldiers: "Be careful, there are many landmines in Nantian!" But they still cannot escape the fate of landmines blooming and heads separating.

    田四儿领导保卫翻身果实
    南田民兵震慑阎伪
    太行武委会通令嘉奖
    【本报讯】本月十日太行武委会特发出通令嘉奖榆次南田民兵。该通令称：南田民兵自去年八月成立以来，在田四儿和刘专文领导下曾坚决保护村庄，打击进犯阎伪，获得光辉成绩。尤以今年九月以来机动灵活的地雷战结合冷枪战，前后炸死阎伪三名（内连长一名），伤十六名，已成为榆次边地爆炸斗争的模范旗帜。除通令嘉奖外，武委会并奖给地雷五十颗，鼓励其继续扩大战果。
    据息：南田小村离十阎伪据点仅余里，去秋解放后在政府领导下曾将大恶霸××斗倒，田四儿与退伍军人刘专文等十二个青年即组织民兵，保卫群众翻身利益，并与北田、田郊等村民兵组成联防，互相支援作战。一年来他们曾活捉阎伪军及特务二十名，炸死十九名，缴获步枪四支，机枪一挺，击溃敌人无数次水淹该村及抢粮抓丁等活动。今年九月后，“还乡团”、“复仇队”等更疯狂进犯，欲摧垮南田，他们乃组织全村群众转移出村，并将老弱移至安全地带，村内外满布地雷，民兵在村内坚持，无敌情时打钟叫群众回村生产，一有敌情即掩护群众退却，并与联防民兵共同打击敌人。九月八日“复仇队”四十余人趁阴雨以为群众民兵不防时向南田进犯，但为他们侦悉，在其来路上埋设地雷四颗，敌人尚未进村即将其连长等三人炸死，他们趁“复仇队”混乱之际集中火力猛烈射击，将其击退，除炸死三人外，并炸伤十一名。九号阎伪八十余人到北田抢粮，田四儿带领民兵分三路支援，一直冲进北田，截回大车一辆，骡子两头，麦子十余石，并打伤阎伪一名。十月十日田等又以飞雷接连爆炸，死伤阎伪四名。自九月以来，他们共计作战六次，爆炸地雷六个，炸死阎伪十九名（内连长一名），炸得阎伪军心惊胆跳，不敢轻易到南田抢粮，出来时长官亦再三向士兵说：“小心呀，南田地雷多！”但仍然逃不掉地雷开花、脑袋分家的命运。
