[Report from the Jilu豫 (Ji-Lu-Yu) Frontline Reporter Group, 18th] The Chiang Kai-shek's direct line 11th Division arrived at Ding Village, west of Juancheng, and separated the men and women of the village, assigning the young women to various courtyards for the beasts to rape. Some soldiers even shamelessly ran around in the streets with money, yelling, "Where are the pretty girls? Money for you!" When they couldn't find any, they cursed, "The women of North China are so feudal." The landlords suffered the same fate; the "National Army" showed them no respect. Consider the following facts! Soldier Yang Zhongyong raped Ding Zigui's forty-year-old wife twice in one night. Originally, after the 11th Division arrived, they asked Ding Zigui to be the Ba長 (head of the village self defense), but seeing the situation was unbearable, he served for only two days before fleeing with his wife and children to the area where our guerrillas operate. Yan Qingyou's wife, already forty-two years old, was raped three times. Unable to bear it, she risked her life to report to the brigade headquarters, but was scolded instead. Ding Zicong had two daughters, one nineteen and one seventeen. The Kuomintang soldiers stationed at his house raped the sisters for two whole days. Old Mrs. Ding, enraged, ran around the courtyard crying, begging them to spare her daughters. The "National Army" thought the old woman was causing trouble, gave her a severe beating, and drove her out of the gate. The soldiers of the 11th Division are all from the South and love to bathe. When they bathe, they force young women to take off their clothes and scrub their backs. The women say in private, "Even the Japanese devils weren't this bad." The grain, chickens, ducks, geese, pigs, and sheep in Ding Village were all eaten, and the firewood was burned. Ding Shujiao went to the brigade headquarters to complain, and the brigade commander gave him one thousand yuan. Ding Shujiao said it was too little. The brigade commander said, "Do you want to get rich?" Ding Shujiao had no choice but to cry and go home. Before he even stepped through the door, the soldier burning his firewood beat Ding Shujiao half to death outside the door. The crops in the fields of Ding Village were eaten by horses, the trees were burned, the houses were dug through to make fortifications, and the people's cotton quilts were requisitioned for military use. With the arrival of the "National Army," the people of Ding Village lost everything. In the cold winter days, they are starving, freezing, and facing death. Their only hope is to hear the sound of the Eighth Route Army's counterattack.

　　鄄城地主丁子桂全家逃入游击区
    不堪蒋军暴行！
    【本报冀鲁豫前线记者团十八日电】蒋家嫡系十一师到了鄄城之西的丁庄，把村里的老百姓男女分开关起来，把青年妇女分配到各个院落里，让野兽强奸，有的士兵还无耻地拿着票子在街上乱跑乱叫：“那里有花姑娘？给票子！”到最后找不到了，就骂着：“华北妇女这么样封建。”地主们也一样遭了殃，“国军”并不给他们留面子，请看下面的事实吧！士兵杨忠勇一夜强奸丁子桂四十岁的老婆两次。原来十一师到后就叫丁子桂当保长，他看情形受不了，只当两天就带着老婆儿女跑到我游击队活动地区。阎庆友的老婆已四十二岁，被强奸了三次后，气不过才拚了老命去报告旅部，结果反被骂了一顿。丁自聪有两个姑娘，一个十九，一个十七，蒋军在他家放哨，把她姊妹俩整整轮奸了两天。丁老太太气的在院里跑着哭着，要求饶了她们。“国军”认为这老太太在捣乱，给了一顿毒打之后，赶出大门。十一师的士兵都是南方人，爱洗澡，洗澡时，强迫青年妇女脱光了衣服给他们擦背，妇女们背地里说：“日本鬼子也没有这样坏”。丁庄的粮食和鸡鸭鹅猪羊都吃光了，柴火被烧光了。丁庶焦去旅部控告，旅长给了一千元，丁庶焦说太少。旅长说：“你想发财？”丁庶焦只好哭着回家，脚还没踏进门，烧他柴火的士兵就在门外把丁庶焦打了个半死。丁庄地里的庄稼被马吃光了，树被烧光了，房子被挖透做了工事，老百姓的棉被集中军用了。“国军”来了，丁庄人民没有了一切，他们在严冬的日子里，挨饿受冻，面临着死亡，他们的唯一希望，就是听八路军反击的枪声。
