Puyang County War Support Work Experience
    Li Jian, Chang Xiu
    The stretcher bearers and militiamen in Puyang County were so enthusiastic, constantly requesting to go to the front lines. Those who fell ill on the road rushed back, and those who were streamlined and told to return home refused to leave... The fundamental reason for this is that "the ideological foundation was well laid."

    To understand what the masses are "thinking," one must start there to conduct education. The content should be simple, use plain language, fit their psychology, and gradually improve their understanding in line with their own requirements. For example, when they came, they all had the determination to "complete the task," but in reality, they came to "complete" it "for the leadership," and in fact, they had the mindset of "considering it a business trip." After arriving at the supply station, we used this mindset to enlighten and educate them, and the discussion topic was: "Are we on this business trip for others, or for ourselves?" After exposing rumors, we guided them to realize that "from doing it for others, to doing it for themselves." We asked them: "Who are the troops fighting for? They are bleeding for us. Aren't they our friends? If our friends are injured for us, is it too much to carry them?" Only after enlightening them from "for others, for friends, and also for ourselves" did we manage to connect their understanding with their own interests. They all said: "If they are doing this for us, and we don't go, then we would be letting down the leadership, our friends, and ourselves!" At this point, they truly changed from unconsciously completing the task, to consciously and voluntarily serving the front lines due to the improvement of their awareness. Therefore, the idea of "business trip" naturally turned into "only after receiving the completion certificate can we truly consider the task completed. Otherwise, going back and coming back again would truly waste manpower and delay production."

    After raising awareness, it is also necessary to strengthen confidence. Because the masses have not participated in combat, especially the characteristics of mobile warfare with large-scale advances and retreats, it is necessary to make them understand this well. The more cities Chiang's army occupies, the more dispersed its strength becomes, and the easier it is for us to annihilate them. Once we annihilate their main force, the others will retreat without a fight, and they will not be able to defend the cities in the end; they will ultimately be ours. With this, their confidence was strengthened, and their morale was boosted, and they competed to volunteer. At this time, the leadership once again praised and encouraged everyone: "Our Puyang County won the championship flag last time under the leadership of County Magistrate Ji. Everyone knows about the stretcher bearers of Puyang County. How glorious! We must not let others take it away this time." The masses replied: "That won't do. We must do even better than last time. We also want to win the championship flag." As a result, the morale of the masses was even higher, and then everyone put forward the following conditions: (1) Resolutely obey orders, do whatever we are told, and not fall behind; (2) Not violate discipline, and integrate with the masses; (3) Do mass work, and help with the busy farming season; (4) Complete the task, and have a completion certificate. Some even volunteered to go to the front line to carry the wounded, and some young people vowed to seize rifles. At that time, there was a competition frenzy between districts, teams, and individuals. The masses act on what they say. They supervised each other and competed to work for the masses, peeling grain, carrying water, and collecting manure.

    Cadres were allocated according to the needs of the war, and combat units were divided. Each village was a squad, controlled by village cadres. Five stretchers formed a detachment, a combat unit, with a captain, vice-captain, and instructor. A company had a variable number of people, and the cadres were capable district-level cadres who were detached from production and could operate independently. The brigade was personally led by the county political commissar. Companies and brigades all had three to five doctors of both Chinese and Western medicine. In this way, there were both backbones and a leadership core. At the same time, the leaders also felt that the previous stretcher-bed method was "heavy and clumsy." Eight people took turns carrying one, and if someone was sick, there was no way to change shifts, and more importantly, it greatly delayed production. Therefore, the initiative was launched to make two-person stretcher beds, reducing two people per stretcher, and allowing for three shifts, which was both lighter and saved manpower. In this way, fewer people went out, and more productive forces could be added at home.

    Whether county, district, or village cadres or the masses, they were all divided into classes, uniformly allocated and centrally used by the county headquarters, and departed in shifts. The county, district, and villages all had headquarters, and everything was in sync from top to bottom. In addition to the supply and transportation, mobilization, and general affairs departments, the county headquarters also established medical, transportation, and mass mobilization and production departments. The doctors were all local, and they elected their own minister, so they were particularly obedient to the allocation and all believed that "serving the front line and serving the masses is the most glorious thing." This created a mass health movement. The transportation department erected telephones with various districts, and emergency orders could be issued in a timely manner. The mass mobilization and production department organized production, expanded mutual aid, and organized all large and small labor forces such as teachers, women, and the elderly to rush to plant wheat. The Public Security Bureau stepped up efforts to strictly prevent spies and maintain law and order.

    濮县战勤工作经验
    李坚  常修
    濮县担架队员、民兵的情绪那么高，一个劲的要求上前线，病倒住路上的，又赶上，精简叫回去的不回去……这基本原因，就是“思想根底打的好。”
    要看群众往那里“想”，就从那里下手进行教育。内容要简单，用通俗的话，合乎他们的心理，结合他们本身的要求，一步步的提高。比如来的时候，都有“完成任务”的决心，但实际上是“为了上级”来“完成”的，实际上是“算当趟差”的思想。到兵站后，就根据这种思想，启发教育，讨论题都是：“咱出差，是为了人家，还是为了自己？”经过了揭发谣言，又引导使其认识到“由为人家，转到为自己”。向他们提出：“人家部队为的是谁呀？是为了咱，拚命流血的，算个朋友不？朋友为咱受伤，咱抬一抬还不行吗？”从由“为人家，为朋友，又为自己”启发后，才算使认识与他们的本身利益结合起来。都说：“人家这样为咱，咱要不去，那太对不起上级、朋友和自己啦！”这时，才真的由不自觉的完成任务，由于觉悟的提高，变为自觉自愿的为前线服务了。所以，“当差”的思想，也就自然而然的变为“领了完工证，才算真完成了任务，不的话，回去再回来，那真是又浪费人力，还耽误了生产。”
    提高了觉悟，还得坚定信心。因为，群众没有参加过战斗，特别是大踏步的前进，大踏步的后退的运动战特点，必须叫他们很好了解。蒋军越占城，它的力量就越分散，我们越容易消灭他，把他的主力消灭了，其他的不用打，就会自退，城市他更守不住，终究是我们的。这样他们的信心坚定了，情绪鼓起来了，便争先挑战。这时，领导上又重新向大家表扬鼓动：“咱濮县上次在吉县长领导之下争来了优胜旗，谁都知道咱濮县的担架了，多光荣！咱这回绝不能叫别人拔跑。”群众回答说：“那不行，咱一定得要比上回还好。也要得优胜旗。”这一来，群众的情绪更高了，接着大家又提出以下几个条件：（１）坚决服从命令，叫干啥干啥，不掉队；（２）不违犯纪律，与群众打成一片；（３）做群众工作，帮助农忙；（４）完成任务，有完工证。甚至还有报奋勇到火线去抬伤号的，有的青年发誓要夺大枪，当时，区与区，队与队，个人与个人，都争相挑战，一片竞赛热潮。群众是立说立行的。他们相互监督，大家比着给群众干活，削谷、担水、拾粪。
    根据战争的需要分配了干部，划分了作战单位。每村为一班，有村干掌握，五付担架一个分队为一战斗单位，有正副队长，指导员。中队，人数不等，干部都是脱离生产的区级得力干部，都能独立作战。大队由县政委亲自带领。中队大队都有三五个中西医生。这样既有了骨干又有了领导核心。同时领导上还感觉上次的担架用床抬，“沉而笨”，八个人轮班抬一付，若有有病的还没法换班，更重要的是耽误生产太大。所以，就发起了做二人抬小床，每付担架减少两个人，还可以轮三班，既轻便又节省人力。这样，出的人少了，在家就可增加不少的生产力。
    不论县干、区干、村干与群众，都划分成班，由县指挥部统一分配，集中使用，轮流出发。县区村都有指挥部，上下都是一个劲。县指挥部除了供运、动员、总务部门外，又增设了医生、交通、民运生产等部门。医生，都是本地人，他们自己选举了部长，因此也特别听从分配，都认为：“为前线服务，为群众服务，是最光荣的事。”造成了群众卫生运动。交通部，与各区架起了电话，紧急命令能及时下达。民运生产部，组织生产扩大互助，教员、妇女、老年等大小劳动力都组织好，突击种麦，公安局加紧严防特务、维持治安。
