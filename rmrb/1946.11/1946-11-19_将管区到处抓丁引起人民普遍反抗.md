Under the help of its master, American imperialism, Chiang Kai-shek has mobilized 85 percent of his forces to launch a massive offensive against our liberated areas, attempting to eliminate them and thus extinguish the Chinese democratic movement. However, in the past four months of fighting, not only have they failed to eliminate the liberated areas, but 35 brigades of Chiang's troops have been annihilated by us. Insufficient manpower is Chiang's fatal weakness in military affairs. To remedy this weakness, he has had to order conscription, and thus the old methods of grabbing, pulling, buying, and selling... which Chiang's officials are well-versed in, have been applied with even greater intensity.

A small clerk said: "One night, when I was sound asleep, some people with guns broke into my room and dragged me away to a dilapidated theater. My official certificate was useless..." (See Shanghai Wenhui Daily). Another Chiang soldier captured on the front line of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region said: "I am from × County, Sichuan. I was an apprentice at a lithography factory and only needed one more year to complete my apprenticeship. One day, I went out to fetch water when an armed man suddenly grabbed me and told me to be a soldier. That's how I was dragged away without even being allowed to take my water bucket back home. My family doesn't know anything..." People without "citizen certificates" are seized to become soldiers. In Haimen, at the border between the Kuomintang and liberated areas, the Kuomintang took all men without "citizen certificates," from teenagers to fifty-year-olds, a total of several thousand people. Those who are taken and do not have relatives in the county government must pay a deposit of 50,000 to 100,000 yuan to be released. If family members want to see the person who has been taken away to say goodbye, the visitation fee alone costs 5,000 to 30,000 yuan (see Wenhui Daily).

In addition to this, there are many other tricks: there are open assignments, such as in Shenyang, where the mayor ordered that all young men aged 22 must report to a designated location for inspection. From August to September, more than 1,000 people have been forced into the army; there is "National Soldier Training," which is a disguised conscription method used by the Kuomintang in Sichuan. Under the guise of training "National Soldiers," the people are trained locally, and all the expenses for officers and conscripts are borne by the people themselves. When needed, the chiefs of the townships and villages are ordered to arrest and send them (see Chongqing Democratic Daily); there are also names like "Returning Home Corps" and "Self-Defense Forces." According to Wenhui Daily: "Conscription in Qingdao has brought endless worries to the citizens from the beginning. This worry seems to be the deepest among the landlords who fled the liberated areas. They were instigated by secret agents to leave the liberated areas... As a result, they did not find a good life by 'escaping,' but are now heading towards death under heavy oppression... They themselves are slowly being incorporated into 'Returning Home Corps,' 'Self-Defense Forces,' and other disguised units..." In addition, according to many people traveling from the Taodunzhao station north of the Songhua River to Harbin, the Kuomintang authorities are forcing Japanese expatriates sent back to China from the Northeast liberated areas to become soldiers. They said: "When Japanese expatriates pass the Songhua River from Taodunzhao, the Kuomintang army picks out the strong men, copies their names into a roster, and when they arrive in Changchun, they are incorporated into the Kuomintang army according to the roster." (See Democratic Daily). The difficulty of the Kuomintang control area in exhausting its source of troops can be seen generally from this.

What about families in the Kuomintang control area who have no one left to conscript? They still don't have good days. They are constantly subjected to apportionments and levies, with numerous names, such as settlement fees for conscripts, food expenses for conscripts on the road... etc. In reality, these donations all go into the pockets of officials, big and small. In the recent conscription in Beiping, the apportionments were so heavy that each shop in Qianmen was assigned up to 300,000 yuan (Wenhui Daily). A railway bureau clerk in Yangcun, Tianjin, complained: "A few days ago, for the conscription, my family was asked to take out twelve stone of old corn and sixty jin of white flour, saying it was for the conscripts to eat on the road, and also 10,000 yuan in cash, saying it was for the conscripts' pocket money on the road. I calculated it: I have to take out a total of 350,000 yuan in legal tender to be done with it." (Tianjin Dagong Daily)

The so-called "conscripted" soldiers don't have good days every day. Their salaries and provisions are exploited by their superiors at every level. They are not fed well or clothed warmly. They are beaten for the slightest mistake, and no one cares if they are sick. The following ballad in the Democratic Daily fully expresses their suffering:

"………
Joining the ranks is like wearing
Iron chains,
Walking, shitting, someone is
Staring!
………
Pustules and scabs grow all over the body,
Whether you live or die from illness is up to fate..."

The people in the Kuomintang control area are very clear that it was understandable to suffer as a soldier in the past because it was to fight the Japanese devils. Now, suffering as a soldier to fight their own people and die for Chiang Kai-shek is something they are unwilling to do. They use various passive and active methods to resist. In Jiangyin, Jiangsu, two conscripts hanged themselves because they could not bear the Kuomintang's abuse and were unwilling to die for Chiang Kai-shek. Another conscript cut off the five fingers of his left hand to resist military service (see Wenhui Daily). In addition, incidents of mass resistance are also common: In Shuigaozhuang, Jinghai County, Hebei Province, the Baojia chiefs and wealthy landlords privately filled out forms for the sons and daughters of poor peasant youths, forcibly ordering them to draw lots to become conscripts, while the youths of wealthy landlords or relatives and friends of the Baojia chiefs were concealed or reported but not conscripted, and the poor people were taken to fight the civil war. As a result, the poor people of the whole village united to resist. (Tianjin Dagong Daily)

Under his greedy and brutal conscription and various evil policies, the people have risen up in resistance. The civil uprisings and armed forces in the eleven provinces of Sichuan, Hunan, Guizhou, Fujian, Guangdong, Kang, Shaanxi, Yunnan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui have reached 200,000 people, possessing various guns, cannons, sea vessels, and warships, and are well-disciplined and supported by the people. If Chiang Kai-shek continues to grab conscripts everywhere madly, the people's resistance will become more widespread and enlarged, which will not only fail to solve his troop source problem but will also drag down his hind legs in attacking the liberated areas.

    将管区到处抓丁引起人民普遍反抗
    吴舫
    蒋介石在其主子美帝国主义的帮助之下，调用了百分之八十五的兵力疯狂地向我解放区大举进攻，企图消灭解放区，以便消灭中国民主运动。但四个月来的战斗，不但未能消灭解放区，相反的蒋军三十五个旅被我消灭了。兵力不足，是蒋贼在军事上的致命弱点，为了补救这个致命的弱点，便不得不下令征兵，于是拉、抓、买、卖……这一套为蒋家官员操之有素的老办法，便变本加厉的运用起来了。
    一个小公务员说：“某夜，我睡得正酣时，忽有带枪的人破门闯入我的内室，把我拉着就走，拉到一个破烂的戏院里。我虽有机关的证明书也无效了。……”（见上海文汇报）又一个在冀鲁豫前线上被俘的蒋军士兵说：“我是四川×县人，在一家石印厂学徒，只差一年就出师。一天，我出外担水，忽然有个武装的人拉我就走，要我当兵去，我就这样连水桶都没让拿回去便被拉走了。家里人一个也不知道。……”没有“公民证”的人就抓去当兵，在海门，国民党与解放区交界地方，国民党在那里将没有“公民证”的男子，自十多岁至五十岁一齐带走，共有几千人。被带走的如与县官没有亲属关系，要想释放，须缴五万至十万元保证金。如果家人里要和被带走的人见见面以告别，仅见面费就要五千元至三万元（见文汇报）。
    除此而外，还有许多的花样：有公开指派，如沈阳征兵，该市市长下令，所有二十二岁青年男子，一律到指定地点候验，从八月到九月已有一千多人被迫入伍；有“国民兵训练”、这是国民党在四川所采用的变相抽丁办法，假借训练“国民兵”将老百姓就地训练，一切官长及壮丁用费都由老百姓自己出，等到要用时，就命令各乡保长捉送（见重庆民主报）；有所谓“还乡团”、“自卫队”的名称，据文汇报载：“青岛征兵，一开始就给市民带来了无限的忧惧。这一忧惧似乎又以从解放区逃出去的地主为最深重，他们受了特务的挑拨而离开了解放区，……结果“逃生”没有得到好生，眼前却在重重压迫下走向死地了。……他们自身却慢慢被编到“还乡团”、“自卫队”等变相部队里去了。……”另外，据许多从松花江北岸陶顿昭车站到哈尔滨的人士谈，国民党当局强迫东北解放区遣送归国的日侨当兵。他们说：“日侨从陶顿昭过松花江，国民党军就把壮丁挑选出来，名字抄在花名册上，到了长春，就按名册编入国民党军。”（见民主报）。蒋管区兵源枯竭的困难，于此可见一般。
    在蒋管区无丁可出的人家又怎样呢？同样的没有好日子过，经常要分摊派款，名义众多，什么给壮丁安家费，什么给壮丁路上食用费……等等，实际上这些捐款都入了大小官儿的荷包。北平这次征兵，分担派款，前门每家商店被派有多至三十万元的（文汇报）。天津杨村一铁路局公务员伸诉说：“前几天为征兵叫我家拿出十二石老玉米，还拿六十斤白面，说是给应征兵役者路上吃饭用，还要现款一万元，说是给应征者路上零用。我算了算：总得拿出法币三十五万元才了事。”（天津大公报）
    所谓“征”来的兵，天天都没好日子过，粮饷被上级层层剥削了，吃不饱，穿不暖，做错了一点点小事就挨打，生病也没人问，民主报上有这样一个歌谣实足表现其苦状：
    “………
    进了队伍就像带了
    铁链子，
    走路，屙屎，有人
    盯！
    ………
    脓疱干疮全身生，
    生病死活只有听天命。………”
    蒋管区老百姓是很清楚的，从前当兵受苦尤有可说，因为那是为了打日本鬼子，现在当兵受苦打自家人，替蒋介石送命，他们不愿意这样作，他们用各种消极的与积极的方法，进行抗拒。江苏江阴有两个壮丁因受不了国民党虐待，不愿替蒋介石送命而吊死了，更有一个壮丁自己切断了左手五指以抗拒兵役（见文汇报）。另外，群起反抗的事也屡见不鲜：河北静海县水高庄保甲长及富户地主私自填报贫农青年子弟，强令抽签当壮丁，而富户地主青年或保甲长亲戚友好都隐而不报或报而不征，而将贫民拿去打内战，于是全村贫民便联合起来进行反抗。（天津大公报）
    在其贪婪残暴的役征及各种恶政之下，人民纷起抗拒，川、湘、黔、闽、粤、康、陕、滇、苏、浙、皖十一省的民变武装已达二十万人，拥有各种枪炮、海船、军舰，并且纪律良好，受到人民拥护。如果蒋介石仍到处疯狂抓丁，人民的反抗蒋更普遍更扩大，不但不能解决他的兵源问题，反而会拖住他进攻解放区的后腿。
