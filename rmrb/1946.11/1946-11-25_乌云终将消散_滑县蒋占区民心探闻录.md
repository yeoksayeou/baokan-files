　　The Dark Clouds Will Eventually Disperse
    A Record of Popular Sentiment in the Jiang-Occupied Areas of Huaxian County
    Xiang Yang
    Terror enveloped everything in the areas of Huaxian County where the Jiang troops were stationed, but the broad masses had a firm belief: "The dark clouds will certainly not obscure the sun forever." Even the traitors and the "Returning Home Corps" organized by Jiang's secret agents did not believe they would stay long. They sent the grain they had seized from the masses to the Longhai Railway, preparing to flee at any time.
    When the Jiang troops entered the Huaxian area, they spread rumors in the villages where they were stationed, saying, "The Eighth Route Army has been wiped out, and the rest have been driven into the grasslands!" The "Returning Home Corps" threatened the peasants who had turned themselves around, wanting to take back the land and grain that the peasants had obtained. For a time, it really seemed like the world had changed. But the peasants were not easily deceived. They secretly held meetings and tried to find out from all sides whether there were still Eighth Route Army soldiers. They chose their own representatives, bypassed the villages occupied by the Jiang troops, and traveled one or two hundred li to find out the news. When they saw the Eighth Route Army, tears of joy flowed from their eyes. They then traveled through the night, bypassing countless villages occupied by the enemy, to bring the news of the Eighth Route Army to their brothers and elders.
    One morning, several villages were plastered with slogans of the Eighth Route Army. The people excitedly spread the word, "The Eighth Route Army is back!" Immediately, the bad landlords in many villages panicked. Some who were in the process of taking back grain from the peasants stopped automatically. The "Returning Home Corps" handed in their guns to the team headquarters and quit. They took most of the grain that had been snatched from the peasants to the south of Changyuan, preparing to flee at any time.
    In a certain village, an evil landlord of the "Returning Home Corps" who had been struggled against, walked down the street with an arrogant swagger when he returned with the Jiang troops, threatening the peasants in the village that he would settle accounts with the peasants who had struggled against him. But now his face had turned yellow, and he was desperately preparing to flee with the "National Army." His wife cried with tears streaming down her face, scolding him like she was teaching her son, "It's all the fault of you, you old dog, for creating such a disaster! If you hadn't come back, I would have lived comfortably. After you came back, you pouted your stinking mouth all day long, talking nonsense everywhere. Now you want to run away, causing my family to be afraid to stay here too!" Many members of the "Returning Home Corps" in the villages, who were thinking of launching a counter-offensive, no longer dared to show their faces after hearing this news, and secretly asked people to make amends with the members of the peasant association. Landlords who had not fled also maintained a neutral attitude, saying, "The Eighth Route Army will come back!" There were also some evil landlords who, although they had been struggled against, understood that the struggle was reasonable, so they fled the Jiang-occupied areas with their whole families and closely followed the Eighth Route Army.

　　乌云终将消散
    滑县蒋占区民心探闻录
    向阳
    滑县蒋军驻地恐布笼罩了一切，但是广大群众都有一个坚定的信念：“乌云一定不会永远遮住太阳的”，就连汉奸和蒋特组织的“还乡团”也不相信他们会待得长久，他们把从群众夺取的粮食，都送到陇海路上去，准备随时逃跑。
    蒋军进入滑县地区，在他们的驻村造谣说：“八路军被打光了，剩下的都给赶到草地里去了！”“还乡团”威胁翻了身的群众，要夺回农民已得的土地和粮食，一时真像是变了天，可是农民们是不会轻易受骗的，他们在秘密的开会，他们想法到四外去探听，究竟还有没有八路军。他们选了自己的代表，绕过蒋军侵占了的村庄，跑到一、二百里以外来探消息，当他们见到八路军之后，高兴的眼里流出热泪，他们又在黑夜里，绕过无数敌人侵占的村庄，把八路军的消息带给他们的兄弟和父老们。
    有一个早晨，好几个村子里贴满了八路军的标语，老百姓都兴奋的传说着：“八路军又回来了！”立刻好多村庄里的坏地主都着了慌，有些正在从农民倒回粮食的，自动停止了。“还乡团”都向队部缴枪不干了。他们把由农民抢去的粮食，大部分拉到长垣以南去，准备随时逃跑。
    某村一个被斗过的“还乡团”恶霸地主，当他随蒋军回来的时候，在大街上走着八字步，恐吓村里的农民，要向斗过他的农民算帐；但是现在他的脸色变的发黄了，他丧魂失魄的准备跟随“国军”逃走，他的老婆涕泪横流的哭叫着，像教训自己的儿子一样的骂道：“都是你这老狗造的孽惹下的祸害呀！你要不回来，我到过的舒舒服服的，你回来了，整天噘着一只臭嘴，到处乱讲，这一下你想跑啦，害得俺家也不敢在啦！”好多村里的“还乡团”正想打反攻，听了这消息，再也不敢出头露面了，背地里托人和农会会员们说好的。未逃亡过的地主，也都保持了中立的态度，他们说：“八路军还会回来的！”也有一些恶霸地主，虽然他们被斗争过，但他们明白了斗争是合理的，他们也就全家逃出了蒋占区，紧紧的跟随着八路军。
