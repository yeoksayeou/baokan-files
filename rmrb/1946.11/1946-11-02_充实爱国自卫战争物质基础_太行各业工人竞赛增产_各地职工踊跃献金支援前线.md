　　To enrich the material foundation of the patriotic self-defense war, workers in various industries in Taihang are launching a new heroic campaign of production increase with great enthusiasm. A certain iron factory in Changzhi City originally planned to complete five months of production (until the end of the year) in August, September, and October, but completed 72.6% in August and September. Wang Fulai, an apprentice at the Huafeng Iron Factory in the city, had no skills and could only do heavy work. However, under the call of the factory's production increase committee, he took time to pick up broken pottery pieces outside and ground them into powder overnight to make a fire cover for the red furnace. The iron bars on the cotton gin, which used to be made eight a day, are now made twelve a day. The Xiaochebao Coal Mine in Lucheng produced 640 catties of coal a day in August and 730 catties a day in September. Their slogan is: "Drive the carts faster and load them full." Since the 25th day of the eighth lunar month, the peasant textile factory in the county launched a competition. Worker Fan Guisheng used to weave 4.5 zhang of broadcloth on an iron loom every day, but now weaves 5.5 zhang. Xiao Heier, a 19-year-old young worker, used to weave four dozen socks a day, but now weaves six dozen. Liang Yongxi, a worker at the Ciyaotou Kiln in Xiangyuan, used to pull one "formation" of coal a day, but now pulls three "formations."
　　
　　[Another Dispatch] On the 19th and 20th of last month, workers in various factories and mines in the First Sub-district of Taihang launched a campaign to donate money to support the front lines. All employees of eight mines and factories, including the Shengli Coal Mine and the Fenwu Factory, donated a total of 420,000 yuan. They also sent letters to the frontline soldiers, expressing that they would intensify production, build more munitions, and mine more coal to supply the needs of the front.

　　[Reported from Xingtai by this newspaper] All employees of Guanghua Iron Factory, affiliated to the Iron Industry Promotion Association of this city, launched a donation campaign. In one day alone on the 13th, they donated more than 200,100 yuan. Comrades Han Zhensheng, Zhang Zhenting, Wang Zuodong, director of the factory trade union, and others, each donated more than 5,000 yuan. Under their influence, workers, staff, apprentices, cooks, and laborers actively donated their savings, totaling 200,1880 yuan, which has now been sent to the Political Department of the military region for transfer to the front lines.
