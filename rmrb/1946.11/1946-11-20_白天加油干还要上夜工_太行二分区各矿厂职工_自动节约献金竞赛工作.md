    【This Newspaper, Wuxiang News】In the Taihang Second Sub-district, workers in various places are automatically practicing thrift to support the front lines. Workers in factories and mines in Wuxiang, Xiangyuan, and Zuoquan have launched enthusiastic movements to comfort the troops. Comrade Sun Tianqing of the Baihe Coal Mine said, "I have been frugal during 70 days of production labor. Now I have more than 500 yuan left, which I will send to our army and tell them to fight well, defeat the Chiang army, and avenge the hatred of us workers who were under his rule in the past!" Li Yantian and Cui Tianran from the factory of the Wuxiang Military Commission each took out 500 yuan and proposed to work overtime at night in addition to working doubly hard during the day, to ensure high quantity and high quality. Only by making good firearms can we better strike the reactionaries. To this end, the entire factory has launched a revolutionary competition. Production is currently underway in full swing. Comrade Qu Quanyong of the Public Security Bureau's Repair Shop said, "I will give the army 500 yuan of my savings and 50 eggs produced, so they can eat better meals and have more strength to fight Chiang Kai-shek."
    Wuxiang has donated a total of 70,000 yuan. Together with Xiangyuan, Zuoquan, the Public Security Bureau's Repair Shop, and the Taihang Second Sub-district Military Commission's Repair Shop, the total donation is more than 110,000 yuan, as well as soap, toothbrushes, towels, cloth socks, toothpaste, and other items.
