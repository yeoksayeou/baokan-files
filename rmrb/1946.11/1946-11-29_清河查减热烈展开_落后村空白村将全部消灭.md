　　Qinghe Land Investigation and Rent Reduction Campaign Vigorously Unfolds
    Backward Villages and Blank Villages Will Be Completely Eliminated
    [Reported by our newspaper from Weixian on the 26th] After the Qinghe County land investigation and rent reduction movement was deployed in early October, it underwent a period of brewing, and now the struggle is unfolding vigorously throughout the county. By October 25th, the struggles in the first and second districts had achieved initial victories. The fourth and fifth districts have also basically completed their struggles, and the third district is in the midst of a major struggle. This movement is grand in scale, rapid, and enthusiastic, and the masses are highly motivated. In the first district, fifty villages have launched struggles. After the village cadre meeting in the second district on the 13th, the village cadres of Li Liuzhuang returned to their village, and the struggle meeting was convened on the same day. Some backward villages in the first district, such as Houshidian and Niutun, have also been drawn into the struggle. The first district has seized a total of 1,302 large mu and 356 small mu of land, and a total of 30 hectares of temple land and clan land. The second district is estimated to obtain 3,000 mu of land (including donated land, excluding public land and temple land), completely eliminating the extremely poor, and some villages have eliminated poor peasants, such as Gexianzhuang, Yangrulin, Liu Shuangmiao, Caijiazhuang, and Liulin. It is estimated that by the end of this movement, backward villages and blank villages can be eliminated, and most poor families of revolutionary army soldiers and martyrs can be promoted to middle peasants.

　　清河查减热烈展开
    落后村空白村将全部消灭
    【本报威县二十六日电】清河县查减运动从十月初布置下去后，经过了一段酝酿，现在全县斗争轰轰烈烈的开展。至十月二十五号，一、二两区的斗争就已初步告捷。四区五区也初步斗完，三区正在大斗中。这次运动规模宏大迅速热烈，群众情绪十分高涨。一区有五十个村展开了斗争。二区十三号村干部会开完，李六庄的村干部回村以后，斗争会当天就召开了。一区有些落后村，如后食店牛屯也都摧入斗争。一区共斗出土地一千三百零二大亩，三百五十六小亩，庙地族地等共有卅顷，二区估计可得到三千亩土地（献田在内、公田庙地不在内）全部消灭了赤贫，有些村已消灭贫农，如葛仙庄、杨儒林、刘双庙、蔡家庄、柳林等村。估计这次运动结束，可以消灭落后村空白村，大部分贫苦抗属可升为中农。              （雨屏、储文）
