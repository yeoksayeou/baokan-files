How to Unite Middle Peasants in the Great Movement
    —The Work Experience of Yang Weicheng in Daming
    Zhao Yunyi

    Yang Weicheng is a village in the third district of Daming, with 300 households. In terms of class divisions, there are landlords, rich peasants, and many impoverished peasants, but middle peasants account for the absolute majority. At the beginning of the mass movement, although the leadership had announced the policy of "not struggling against middle peasants and absorbing middle peasants to participate in the struggle" at mass meetings, due to the lack of clarity and certainty in the leadership's thinking, four middle peasants were detained as targets at the beginning of the struggle, in addition to the landlords, and preparations were made to struggle against them. The reason was that they all truly owed the masses something, but unexpectedly, precisely because four middle peasants were detained, the entire middle peasant class in the village underwent the following changes and expressions:

    (1) A portion of the middle peasants poured into the peasant association, some after we announced the middle peasant policy, dispelling past doubts; while others expressed progress while avoiding struggle.

    (2) Some individual middle peasants were frugal, had less contact with fellow villagers, and when they saw that the village had begun to struggle, and four middle peasants had been detained, they estimated that they would soon be struggled against if they couldn't explain themselves clearly. They figured they might as well eat and drink while they could, saying "the mouse can't save for the cat." They had no heart to do any work.

    (3) Still other middle peasant households, seeing that other middle peasants were being detained, feared that they would be struggled against and fined. They thought it would be better to be enlightened and "voluntarily" do something to save face. These people were usually not stingy in the streets and lived comfortably (were relatively wealthy), so they asked someone or directly told the peasant association that they would "voluntarily" hand over land or "voluntarily" hand over grain.

    (4) There were also some middle peasants who were usually very backward. They only believed that the village cadres could "chou qu" (help speak well of them) and prevent them from being struggled against, so they prepared some gifts (vegetables, fruits, pastries, etc.) to send to the village cadres separately.

    From the above, it seems that because we detained several middle peasant households at the beginning of the movement, although we had not yet begun to struggle or fine them, it had already formed a serious consequence of unease among some middle peasants. After review, there was an intentional or unintentional idea in the leadership's thinking that good middle peasants should not be struggled against, but problematic middle peasants still had to be struggled against. Economically, their interests might not be harmed, but politically, they had to be hit. It was precisely because we had left such a tail in our thinking, coupled with the above-mentioned problems of the middle peasants themselves, that it was easy to involve the middle peasants in the mass movement. In the final analysis, it was still because our understanding of the middle peasant policy was not clear enough, and we did not affirm that middle peasants must never be struggled against. Even if individual middle peasants had made mistakes, they should not be detained together with the evil landlords, nor should they be struggled against in the same venue. The mistakes of the middle peasants should be treated as a family matter, and they should be urged to correct their mistakes through criticism, education, persuasion, and encouragement. People who have opinions on them can also express their opinions to them as much as possible during the persuasion, so as to achieve the goal of truly uniting the middle peasants. Based on our review, we handled the four detained middle peasant households in this way: first, we convened a mass meeting to further explain the middle peasant policy, that the laboring people are one family, and that if middle peasant households have made some mistakes, they should be welcomed to voluntarily confess and resolve them peacefully. They must never be struggled against together with the landlords. On the contrary, they should be absorbed to participate in the movement, and they will also be divided the fruits in the future. After group discussions and deliberations by the masses, everyone unanimously passed the unconditional release of the detained middle peasants, and no more detentions would be made in the future. The next day, the peasant association held a meeting, and these four middle peasants who had been detained naturally went to the meeting and confessed their mistakes to everyone: one said: I joined the enemy's Yiguan Dao, was deceived, and made mistakes. I almost became an enemy agent. Today, I am willing to confess and repent to everyone. One said: I notoriously reported the activists in our village who borrowed grain to the enemy, causing them to be beaten. Today, I am willing to compensate them for their losses. One said: I embezzled two thousand bricks from the public village, and I will hand them over immediately. One said: When I was the village head, I was corrupt, and my attitude was not good when collecting debts. Today, I am willing to be punished by everyone. After they confessed, the people present also gave some opinions. Finally, they applauded to welcome them to the peasant association, and the four of them immediately squatted on the grass where the members of the peasant association were sitting. Their happy mood made them full of smiles. The middle peasants in the village, who had been frowning in the past few days, have been smiling in recent days, and batches of people are pouring into the peasant association, and the strength of the masses has grown. From solving the problem of Yang Weicheng, we have experienced the following problems:

    (1) The middle peasants are a large population class in the village. During the mass movement, as long as we explain the unity policy of "the middle and poor peasants are one family" and "do not struggle against middle peasants," the middle and poor masses can accept it, but the middle peasants are not all flawless, and the mistakes of a few middle peasants (only a few individuals) are very harmful to the masses. But it should be affirmed that this is not the root of the poverty of the masses. Under the encouragement of the middle peasant policy and the call of the masses, after the struggle against the landlords (or even before), these middle peasant households will confess their mistakes to the masses. At this time, the anger of the masses will be mostly dispelled, and if they raise some opinions, it will be nothing. They can completely forgive them like a family.

    (2) To solve the problem well, do not rely solely on whether the thinking of a few activists is clear (of course, we must strive for their clear thinking), but mainly repeatedly deliberate and discuss the middle peasant policy among the masses, and hold confession and criticism meetings (not struggle meetings) for the few middle peasants who have made mistakes. In this way, on the one hand, the education and striving for middle peasants is of great significance, and at the same time, only in this way can the internal contradictions of the middle and poor peasants be resolved ideologically and the unity of the middle and poor peasants be consolidated.

    (3) The middle peasant policy must be clearly affirmed in the leadership's thinking, coupled with an accurate understanding of the situation, the phenomenon of detaining and struggling against middle peasants can be avoided. Even if middle peasants are detained in the great movement, they can be quickly released after being handled by the masses.

    (4) After the masses have moved, the "voluntary" gift-giving, etc. of the middle peasants should not only not be accepted, but more importantly, we must immediately carefully consider and check why the middle peasants are doing this. In the end, we will find that it is either that we have detained or struggled against the middle peasants, or that our middle peasant policy has not been trusted by the middle peasants. We should seize these concrete facts and conduct propaganda and education at any time. Facts have proved that once our middle peasant policy is trusted by the middle peasants, they will naturally not "voluntarily" hand over land or grain.

　　怎样在大动中团结中农
    ——大名杨未城的工作经验
    赵芸一
    杨未城是大名三区一个村庄，全村三百户人家，在阶级划分上有地主有富农也有不少的赤贫农，但中农占着绝对多数。在群众大动之初，领导上虽也曾在群众大会上宣布了“不斗中农，并吸收中农参加斗争”的中农政策，但由于领导思想不够明确和肯定，于开始斗争时，对象中除地主而外，就扣住了四个中农，并准备斗争他们，理由是他们对群众都真正多少有点亏欠，但没料想到正因为扣住了四个中农，本村整个中农阶层却发生了以下的变化与表现：
    （一）一部分中农涌进了农会，有的是在我们宣布了中农政策之后，消失了过去的疑虑；而有的则是一面表示进步，一面躲避斗争。
    （二）有个别中农，省吃俭用，与乡亲少来往，见到村里开始了斗争，四个中农被扣，估计着自己说不清那时即要被斗，不如早些吃点喝点是便宜，说是“老鼠不能给猫省着”，干啥活也没心干了。
    （三）另有一些中农户看到别的中农被扣押，恐怕自己就要挨斗被罚，他们认为不如早些开明“自动”到能落个面子。这样的人平素在街中不很小气，日子过的很陈实（富裕），因此托人或直接给农会说他们“自动”土地，或“自动”粮食。
    （四）还有一些中农平素是很落后的，他只认为村里的干部能给他抽趣（帮助说好话），就可不挨斗，所以他就制备一些礼物（蔬菜、瓜果、点心之类），向村干分别来送。
    从以上看来，出于我们在运动之初，扣着了几家中农，虽是尚未开斗开罚，但已形成部分中农不安的严重后果，经过检讨，在领导思想上有意无意的存在着好中农不斗，但是有毛病的中农还须来斗，在经济上可以不损害其利益，在政治上得打击一下。正是因为在思想上留着这么一个尾巴，再加上中农本身有以上的毛病，在群众大动之时，就很容易把中农挂进去。归根结底，还是由于我们对中农政策思想上不够明确，没把决不可斗争中农肯定起来，即便个别中农有过错误，也不应和恶霸地主扣在一起，也不应在同一会场来斗争，应把中农的错误当成自家人问题来处理，用批评教育说劝加勉的方式促其改过，对他有意见的人也可在说劝当中尽量的向他提出意见，达到真正团结中农的目的。根据我们的检讨，对被扣的四家中农作了这样的处理：首先召开群众会议，进一步的阐述中农政策，劳苦人民是一家，如中农户有点过错，应欢迎他们自动坦白，和平解决，绝不能和斗争地主混在一起来斗争，相反的还要吸收他们参加运动，将来还得分到果实；经过群众分组讨论酝酿，大家一致通过将被扣的中农无条件释放，以后不再扣押了。第二天农会开了会，这四个被扣过的中农很自然的走到会场里，向大家坦白自己的错误：一个说：我进过敌人的一贯道，上当了，也犯了错，还几乎当了敌人的特务，我今天愿意向大家坦白悔过。一个说：“以我出名向敌人那里告过咱村借粮时的积极分子，使人家挨了打，今天我愿意赔偿他们的损失”。一个说：“我昧过公村的两千砖，我马上要交出来”。一个说：“我当村长时，贪过污，要帐时态度不好，今愿大家处分”。他们坦白完了，到会的人也你一言我一语的提了些意见；最后鼓掌欢迎他们到农会里来，他们四人随即蹲在农会员坐的草地上了。愉快的心情使他们满脸笑容。该村中农前几天是愁眉苦脸，近日来是喜笑颜开了，一批一批的人涌进到农会里去，群众的力量壮大了。从解决杨未城一问题中，我们体验到以下几个问题：
    （一）中农在村里是人口众多的阶层，在群众大动的时候，只要我们对“中贫农是一家”“不斗中农”的团结政策讲明，中贫群众可以都会接受的，但中农都不是洁白无疵的，而且有少数中农（仅是个别少数）的错误对群众的危害很大，但应肯定的说：这不是群众的穷根，在中农政策和群众的号召鼓舞下，在对地主斗争以后（甚至不等以后），这些中农户就会向群众坦白承认错误。这时群众的气也就消了大半，再提提意见，也就没啥了。是完全能像一家人一样的原谅他们的。
    （二）要想问题解决的好，不要单纯依靠几个积极分子的思想通与不通（当然要争取他们的思想通），主要是把中农政策在群众中反来复去的酝酿讨论，给少数有错的中农开坦白批评会（不应当是斗争会），这样一方面对中农的教育争取意义大，同时，也只有这样才能从思想上解决中贫农内部的矛盾，巩固中贫农的团结。
    （三）中农政策在领导思想上必须明确肯定，再加上对于情况的精确了解，扣押斗争中农现象可以避免，即便在大动中扣着了中农，也能够很快的经过群众处理释放。
    （四）在群众大动起来以后，对中农的“自动”送礼等，不仅不应当接受，更重要的是要立即仔细的考虑检查中农为什么要这样，最后就会发现不是扣押或斗了中农，就是我们的中农政策还没被中农所相信，应抓紧这些具体事实，随时进行宣传教育，事实证明，一旦我们的中农政策为中农所信赖，他们自然就不“自动”土地或粮食了。
