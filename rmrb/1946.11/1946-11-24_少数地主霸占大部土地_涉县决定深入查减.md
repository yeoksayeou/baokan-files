　　A Small Number of Landlords Occupy Most of the Land
    Shexian County Decides to Deepen Investigation and Rent Reduction
    [Our Newspaper] At the beginning of this month, Shexian County convened a conference of more than 1,300 county, district, and village cadres to arrange winter investigation and rent reduction work. At the meeting, a correct assessment was first made of the rent reduction and debt clearing movement since 1942. It was believed that great achievements had been made in weakening feudalism in recent years. The fact that only thirteen impoverished people were left among more than a thousand village cadres is proof of this. However, it is still far from completely eliminating feudalism and realizing the people's demand for "land to the tiller." According to investigations in seven villages, including Lutou, Dongda, Chian, Taicun, Chengli, Beiguan, and Nanguokou, landlords occupied 22.8 percent of the land in the villages before the war against Japan. After several years of rent reduction, they still occupy 14.7 percent. In Lutou, landlords occupied 72 percent of the village land before the war, and now they still occupy 42 percent. Recent statistics from 134 villages in the county show that the average land occupied per person by each class is: landlords, 6.6 mu; rich peasants, 2.67 mu; middle peasants, 2.6 mu; poor peasants, 1.7 mu; and the very poor, 1.1 mu. Most of the land is still occupied by a small number of landlords, and the vast number of poor peasants still lack the land to maintain their livelihoods. Landlords mostly convert their leased land into mortgaged land, exploiting peasants in disguised forms. In order to realize "land to the tiller," a thorough emancipation movement is needed this winter. The meeting pointed out that because the work base of each village is different, the investigation and rent reduction work should also be carried out with different focuses. It was specially decided to carry out the work in three types of villages: 1. Villages where peasants are still subjected to feudal exploitation and landlords have not been thoroughly cleared, such as the 43 villages including Lutou, should focus on investigation and rent reduction and vigorously mobilize the masses. 2. Villages where peasants have gained political status but feudal exploitation has not been completely eliminated, such as the 120 villages including Piancheng and Siziyan, should focus on winter production and carry out investigation and rent reduction in the process of production. 3. Villages where feudal exploitation has been eliminated and "land to the tiller" has been basically realized, such as the 44 villages including Wencun and Chian, should focus on production. The meeting emphasized that special attention should be paid to absorbing women to participate in the investigation and rent reduction movement. In terms of methods, it is necessary to combine winter studies with unfolding the telling of grievances to achieve ideological mobilization. In addition to struggling against a small number of local bullies, despots, and secret agent landlords, general issues should be resolved through symposiums and arbitration. During the movement, it is necessary to pay attention to adjusting the relationship between cadres and the masses and unite with middle peasants. In terms of work style, it is necessary to boldly follow the mass line and prevent patronage and intervention. More than 1,300 cadres have now gone to the countryside and returned to their villages, and a county-wide investigation and rent reduction movement will soon be launched. (Shexian County Office)

　　少数地主霸占大部土地
    涉县决定深入查减
    【本报讯】涉县于本月初召集全县县、区、村干部一千三百余人的大会，布置冬季查减等工作，会上首对四二年以来减租、清债运动作了正确的估价，认为几年来削弱封建已有很大成绩，一千多个村干部中只丢下十三个赤贫即为一证明，但距彻底消灭封建实现耕者有其田之群众要求尚远。据鹿头、东达、赤岸、台村、城里、北关、南郭口等七个村调查。地主抗战前占全村土地百分之二十二·八，经过几年的减租，现仍占百分之十四·七，鹿头地主战前占全村土地百分之七十二，现仍占百分之四十二。全县一百三十四个村最近统计，各阶层每人平均占有土地为：地主六亩六分，富农二亩六分七，中农二亩六，贫农一亩七，赤贫一亩一分。大部土地仍为少数地主霸占着，广大贫苦农民仍缺乏维持生活的土地。地主则多将其大部租地转变为典地，变相剥削农民。为求实现耕者有其田，今冬实需要来一个彻底翻身运动。会上曾指出：由于各个村庄工作基础不同，查减工作也应按不同重点来进行，特决定以三类村庄进行：一、农民仍受封建剥削，地主还未经大清算的村，如鹿头等四十三村，应以查减为中心，大力发动群众。二、农民在政治上有了地位，但封建剥削还未彻底消灭者，如偏城、寺子岩等一百二十个村，中心工作为冬季生产，在生产中进行查减。三、封建剥削已经消灭，基本上实现了耕者有其田的村，如温村、赤岸等四十四村，则以生产为主。会中强调提出：查减运动中要特别注意吸收妇女参加，在方式上要结合冬学展开诉苦作到思想发动，除对少数恶霸、特务地主进行斗争外，一般的应以座谈仲裁方式解决问题。运动中必须注意调整干部与群众的关系，团结中农。作风上要大胆走群众路线，防止恩赐包办。现千三百余干部已分别下乡回村，全县普遍的查减运动不久即将展开。（涉县办公室）
