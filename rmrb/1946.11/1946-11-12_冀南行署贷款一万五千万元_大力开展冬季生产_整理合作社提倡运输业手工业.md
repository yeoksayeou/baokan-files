    Vigorously Develop Winter Production
    Reorganize Cooperatives, and Promote Transportation and Handicraft Industries
    [Our newspaper's dispatch from Weixian, 5th] The Jinnan Administrative Office, in order to develop winter production and assist liberated peasants to take root and become prosperous, has decided to loan 150 million yuan, and issued instructions emphasizing that the content of developing winter production mainly consists of organizing sideline mutual aid, but must develop various sideline productions based on local raw material production, existing technical foundations, and convenient local conditions. In leadership, emphasis should be placed on promoting handicraft industries and transportation industries primarily relying on full labor. The county construction sections should select certain districts and villages to personally conduct pilot research. Secondly, it is to reorganize and establish rural cooperatives. Each county should immediately select appropriate cooperatives to reorganize; in areas where the masses have already been liberated, rural cooperatives can be widely established according to the demands of the masses, without being restricted by formalities, and letting the masses do it themselves, with the government providing assistance if there are difficulties, and providing support through loans. Regarding loan work, the instructions emphasized that it is essential to avoid equal distribution and dispersion; the focus should be placed on areas with a production foundation and that have undergone mass movements. Loan work should be well integrated with organizing production.
