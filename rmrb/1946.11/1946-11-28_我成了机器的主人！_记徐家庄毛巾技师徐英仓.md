　　"I Have Become the Master of the Machine!"
　　——A Record of Xu Yingcang, Towel Technician from Xujiazhuang
　　After starting his career by weaving towels himself, he never forgot his brothers who were just as poor as he was. He enthusiastically passed on his skills to others, saying, "Chairman Mao gave us our rice bowls, and Chairman Mao told us to serve the people. Passing on our skills to others is responding to Chairman Mao's call."
　　Xu Yingcang was once driven from his hometown by the whip of hunger, wandering to Tianjin, where he became an apprentice in the Dechang Towel Factory. The three years of apprenticeship were difficult. He had to take care of chamber pots, buy food, cook... he had to do everything. If the factory owner was unhappy, he would beat him with a whip, and he didn't even dare to cry after being beaten. At that time, he had just mastered his skills and was about to escape from the sea of suffering, able to support his elderly mother. Who knew that he still had to work fifteen hours a day, and the wages he earned were not even enough for his own food and expenses. The life of a worker was truly like being in a wolf's den. Many partners fell ill due to overwork, their bodies became disabled, and as a result, they were fired by the factory owner and starved to death. He believed that this was not a way to survive.
　　In 1934, he ran back to his hometown. His white-haired mother was begging for food all day long and was already as thin as a ghost. He wanted to use his skills to earn some money and stop begging. So he asked relatives and friends and bought a machine. But at that time, Japanese, American, and many foreign goods were being dumped at will. His towels couldn't be sold, so he had to sell the machine again and continue begging. His mother died at this time. He deeply felt that foreign goods had destroyed his livelihood, and he angrily scolded the big officials of China for not caring about anything, for allowing foreigners to open factories and foreign goods to cause his whole family to be scattered. His parents couldn't even afford a coffin when they died.
　　After the Incident, he joined the Eighth Route Army and found light. In 1942, he returned home under the government's leadership to simplify administration and vigorously develop rural handicraft industries to combat the enemy's economy. He received a loan for a towel machine, as well as ten pounds of thread and thirty pounds of rice. After being a machine slave for many years, he became the master of the machine. He cherished the machine very much. Whenever he discovered enemy activity, he always hid his machine first at all costs, praising his "rice bowl" to everyone, saying how easy it was to use and how quickly it wove towels. In this way, he maintained his livelihood with his two hands, and life gradually improved.
　　Having climbed out of the poor pit, he never forgot his poor brothers. When others saw that weaving towels was profitable and asked him for advice, he unreservedly taught them all his skills. He taught more than 300 people in his own village, and he also went to neighboring villages to pass on his skills, even to Xinhe Village, which was hundreds of miles away. Even now, he still takes time every day to teach people and repair machines for them. He often happily said, "I want to make every family in my village, my district, and my county rich, and turn them into Wu Manyous." He also said, "Chairman Mao gave me my rice bowl, and Chairman Mao told us to serve the people. Passing on our skills to others is responding to Chairman Mao's call." In this way, he established prestige and became a technician loved by thousands of people.
　　Now Xu Yingcang has risen from extreme poverty to a middle peasant, married a wife, and plans to earn money to buy a machine and develop into a new-style rich peasant. He really never thought there would be such a day. Xujiazhuang has become rich because of him. If you ask anyone on the street, they will always say, "Yingcang taught us how to weave towels. Our family has benefited a lot from him." (Xinhua News Agency, Jinnan Branch)

　　“我成了机器的主人！”
    ——记徐家庄毛巾技师徐英仓
    他自己织毛巾起家后，从没忘记和他一样穷的弟兄，他热心的把手艺传给别人，他说：“毛主席给咱的饭碗子，毛主席叫咱要给人民服务，咱把手艺传给别人，就是响应了毛主席的号召。”
    徐英仓早先曾被饥饿的鞭子赶出故乡，流浪到天津，在德昌毛巾工厂做起学徒，三年的学徒生活，可难熬哩，端尿壶、买菜、做饭……什么都得干，厂主一不高兴用鞭子乱打，挨了打都不敢哭。那时他刚学好手艺，马上就能跳出苦海，可以养活自己的老娘，谁知每天仍要工作十五小时，挣的工资还是不够自己的吃用。工人生活真是和在狼窝里一样，眼见许多伙伴因劳致疾，把身体弄成残废，结果被厂主解雇活活饿死。他认为这终不是求生的道路。
    民国二十三年他跑回家乡，白发的老娘整天讨饭，已饿的像鬼。他想借自己的手艺挣点钱，不再要饭。于是便求亲告友，买了架机子，但那时日本的、美国的、许多外国货随便倾销，他的毛巾织出来却卖不出去，没办法就又把机子卖掉，仍然要饭，他母亲便在这时死了。他深深感到洋货摧毁了自己的生路，便痛骂中国的大官们管什么鸟事，为什么叫洋人大开工厂，叫洋货闹的我全家失散，爹娘临死连个棺材都摸不着。
    事变后他参加八路军，找到了光明，四二年他简政回家，在政府领导对敌经济斗争大力发展农村手工业政策下，贷到一架手巾机，还有十斤线子，三十斤米，多年做机器奴隶的他，这时成了机器的主人。他对机器十分珍爱，每遇发现敌情，他总不顾一切的先藏好他的机器，见人就夸奖他的“饭碗子”怎样好使，织毛巾怎样快。这样他仗着两只手维持住生活，日子又渐渐好起来。
    从穷坑里爬出来的他，从没忘记像他一样的穷弟兄。别人看到织手巾有利，向他讨教，他就不惜将自己的全部手艺教给别人，在自己村里他前后教会三百多人，他也到过邻村传手艺，甚至传到远至百里的新河乡村。直到现在他每天仍是抽空教人，给人收拾机器。他常常高兴的说：“我愿意叫俺村、俺区、俺县家家致富，变成吴满有。”又说：“毛主席给我的饭碗子，毛主席叫咱要给人民服务，咱把手艺传给人，就是响应毛主席的号召。”就这样他建立起威信，成了千百人爱戴的技师。
    现在的徐英仓从赤贫上升到中农，娶了老婆，计划赚买机子，发展成新式富农，他真是想不到有这么一天。徐家庄有了他，也富起来，随便问起街上的人，总是要说：“织毛巾是英仓教给俺的，俺家里沾他的光可不少呀”。（新华社冀南分社）
