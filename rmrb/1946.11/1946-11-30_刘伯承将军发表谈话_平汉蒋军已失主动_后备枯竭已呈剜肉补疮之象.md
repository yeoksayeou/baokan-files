　　General Liu Bocheng's Talk
    Chiang Kai-shek's Troops on the Pinghan Railway Have Lost the Initiative
    Exhaustion of Reserves Resembles Taking Flesh to Heal Sores
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jinji-Luyu Front, 23rd (delayed)] "Chiang Kai-shek's troops, attempting to open the Pinghan Railway within November, have completely lost the initiative." This was the striking remark made by the renowned strategist General Liu Bocheng in his talk yesterday. General Liu received reporters at his front-line command post, where battlefield victories were constantly being reported over the phone. In the recent battle of Puyang and Hua County on the border of Hebei and Shandong, starting on the 19th, the 104th and 125th Brigades and the 12th General Contingent of the Hebei Security Force were annihilated within four days. Over 8,800 men, including brigade commander Yang Xianming, were captured alive, and 3,000 men, including regimental commander Huang Boliang, were killed or wounded. Chiang Kai-shek, deeply fearing the loss of Kaifeng and facing limited troop strength, had to resort once again to the tactic of taking flesh to heal sores. He urgently transferred a portion of Wang Jingjiu's American-equipped Fifth Army, which had advanced into Yuncheng in the east, to the Dongming area. He also transferred a portion of Wang Zhonglian's army, which had advanced into the Lin County area of northern Henan in the west, to the Hua County area. General Liu said to the reporter with a smile, "Let me tell you 'a Chiang Kai-shek joke.' Among the captured documents, there was a secret order from Chiang Kai-shek, ordering Wang Jingjiu and Wang Zhonglian to advance eastward and westward simultaneously, opening the Pinghan Railway within November. Wang Jingjiu was to proceed through Heze, Yuncheng, Juancheng, Puyang, Qingping to Daming; Wang Zhonglian was to proceed through Lin County, Liuhegou, Anyang, and Linzhang to Daming. After the eastern and western routes joined forces in Daming, they would directly approach Xingtai and join forces with Sun Lianzhong of the Eleventh War Area, and then turn back to take Handan, thus opening the Pinghan Road. Taking a roundabout route instead of directly attacking Handan is truly a painstaking effort, attempting to catch us off guard and lure us into a trap. However, after the loss of four brigades by Chiang Kai-shek's troops in the Battle of Juancheng at the end of October and the recent Battle of Puyang and Hua County, this trick has been completely foiled."

### 刘伯承将军发表谈话  平汉蒋军已失主动  后备枯竭已呈剜肉补疮之象

　　刘伯承将军发表谈话
    平汉蒋军已失主动
    后备枯竭已呈剜肉补疮之象
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫前线二十三日电】（迟到）“企图于十一月内打通平汉线之蒋军，已完全丧失主动”。此为著名战略家刘伯承将军在昨日谈话中之警句。刘将军在其前线指挥部接见记者时，战场捷报正从电话中不断传来。此次冀鲁边境濮阳、滑县之战，从十九日开始，四天内歼灭蒋军一○四与一二五两个旅及河北保安第十二总队，生俘旅长杨显明以下八千八百余人，毙伤团长黄伯亮以下三千人，蒋介石深恐开封有失，又因兵力有限，乃不得不再施其剜肉补疮之术，急将东线进占郓城王敬久部美械第五军抽回一部调至东明一带；将西线进占豫北林县地区之王仲廉军一部调至滑县一带。刘将军带笑语记者：“告诉你‘一个蒋介石的笑话’，此次缴获之文件中，有蒋介石之密令，限令王敬久、王仲廉两人东西并进，于十一月内打通平汉线。王敬久经荷泽、郓城、鄄城、濮县、濮阳、清平至大名；王仲廉经林县、六河沟、安阳、临漳至大名。东西两路会师大名后，直趋邢台，与第十一战区孙连仲会师，回头再取邯郸，于是平汉路通矣。绕湾转路而不直取邯郸，真所谓煞费苦心，此乃企图出我不意，诱我上当。但十月底鄄城之战与此次濮（阳）滑（县）之战，蒋军损失四个旅后，此种诡计已被完全粉碎”。
