    Juancheng Uprising: Northwest Army Officers Denounce Traitor Chiang's Discrimination Against Non-Direct Troops
    [Our correspondent on the Jilu-Yu front, 11th] The first group of 130 KMT army officers who laid down their arms during the Juancheng Victory have arrived at a certain location in the rear. They include Hu Hele, Chief of Staff of the 119th Brigade; Kan Xiaojun, Commander of the 355th Regiment; Yang Guangjie, Deputy Commander of the Regiment; Zhao Ziming, Battalion Commander of the 1st Battalion of the Regiment; Wang Ziping, Battalion Commander of the 2nd Battalion; Wang Zihua, Battalion Commander of the 3rd Battalion of the 356th Regiment; and Zhu Xingyuan, Deputy Commander of the 86th Regiment. Upon their arrival in the rear, all agencies warmly welcomed them with sumptuous meals and cigarettes. The sick were transported by stretcher, and the Eighth Route Army dispatched responsible cadres to comfort and care for them along the way. Wang, Deputy Commander of the Yudong Column, and Hu Hele and Kan Xiaojun were old colleagues. Upon hearing the news, they rushed to visit them. They shook hands and rejoiced at their meeting. Deputy Commander Wang especially invited them to stay overnight for a long chat. Upon arriving at the military region's guest house, they all requested to remove their American-style military uniforms and hats. Gao Yaowu, Secretary of the 356th Regiment, said: "Please give me a different hat! Everywhere, militiamen and ordinary people are shouting 'American-style hats that lead to national ruin.' I have no face to meet anyone." Many officers shamefully removed their American-style cap badges, and Battalion Commander Wang Zihua simply threw his hat away. When the reporter interviewed Regiment Commander Kan, he said: "Our offensive plan this time was to first aim for Juancheng, and Commander-in-Chief Liu set a deadline of four days for arrival. After reaching Juancheng, and after the arrival of the 200th Division's motorized unit, we were to advance northwest of Juancheng. The 11th Division would launch a main attack westward from Yuncheng. Liu Guangxin, Brigade Commander of the 119th Brigade, would command the 86th, 355th, and 356th Regiments, as well as the 1st and 2nd companies of the New Reserve Artillery Tenth Regiment's American-made howitzers, and advance north from Heze in support. When our three regiments were surrounded, the 11th Division was stationed south of Juancheng. Although we sent numerous telegrams requesting them to come to our rescue, they remained unmoved, leading to the annihilation of our entire army." He added: "I fully understand Chiang Kai-shek's vicious tactics. If you fight the civil war, you will have food to eat. But once you are wiped out, don't even think about getting a single additional soldier." When talking about Chiang Kai-shek's discrimination against non-direct troops, Chief of Staff Hu Hele pulled out the shirt and trousers he was wearing and said: "Look at what the Northwest Army wears, and what the direct troops wear." Zhang Tiejian, a lieutenant artillery platoon leader of the 86th Regiment, told reporters that the soldiers were extremely weary of the war. He personally witnessed Zhang Runsan, the commander of the 86th Regiment, killing a company commander with a machine gun. He said: The 2nd Company of the regiment was bombarded with grenades, and more than half of the company was sacrificed. Soldiers repeatedly refused to fight and retreated. Yang, the company commander of the company, was afraid of death and dared not go to the front line. The regimental commander scolded: 'Damn it, anyone who retreats will be shot.' But he could not stop the soldiers from collapsing. When Company Commander Yang retreated, he was actually ordered by Regiment Commander Zhang to be shot by a machine gunner. Therefore, most of the officers and soldiers laid down their arms.

    鄄城罢战西北军官
    痛斥蒋贼排斥杂牌
    【本报冀鲁豫前线十一日电】鄄城大捷中，放下武器的蒋军军官第一批一百三十人，已抵后方某地，其中计有一一九旅参谋主任胡和乐、三五五团团长阚孝君、团副杨光杰、该团第一营营长赵子明、第二营营长王子平、三五六团第三营营长王子华、八十六团团副柱兴远等，他们从前线到后方时，各机关皆以盛馔香烟热忱招待。病号担架抬送，八路军并派负责干部，沿途安慰照护，豫东纵队王副司令与胡和乐阚孝君为昔日老同事，闻讯后星夜前往慰问，见面时握手相庆，欢欣不已。王副司令特留他们歇宿畅谈。抵军区招待所时，他们纷纷要求脱换美式军服帽子。三五六团书记长高耀武说：“给我换一顶帽子吧！到处民兵老百姓在喊‘美式亡国帽子’，我没脸见人了。许多军官惭愧得把美式帽徽摘去，营长王子华干脆把帽子摔掉。记者访问阚团长时，他说：‘我们这次进攻计划，第一步先拟抵鄄城，刘总司令限四天到达。到达鄄城，俟二百师摩托化部队到来后，即向鄄城西北进攻，十一师从郓城向西主攻，一一九旅旅长刘广信指挥八十六、三五五、三五六、三个团及新预备炮十团第一营一、二两连美式榴弹炮由荷泽北上策应。我们三个团被包围时，十一师驻鄄城南，我们虽数次去电请他们速来解围，但他们始终未动，以致全军覆没’。他又说：‘蒋介石手段之毒辣，我心里完全明白，你打内战，便有饭吃。打光了，再也莫想给你补充一兵一卒’。谈及蒋介石排斥杂牌时，参谋主任胡和乐翻出穿在身上的衬衣衬裤说：‘你看西北军穿的是什么，嫡系穿的是什么。’八十六团中尉炮兵排长张铁坚告记者：士兵厌战已极，他亲见八十六团团长张润三，用机枪击毙一连长的事实。他说：该团第二连被手榴弹轰击，全连牺牲过半，士兵数次罢战退缩。该连杨连长怕死不敢上前线、团长骂道：‘妈的，谁退枪毙谁。’但终不能阻止士兵溃退，杨连长退下时，竟遭张团长令机枪手击毙。因此大部官兵纷纷放下武器。”
