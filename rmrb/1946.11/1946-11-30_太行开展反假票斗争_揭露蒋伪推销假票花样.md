　　Taihang Launches Anti-Counterfeit Currency Struggle
    Exposes Chiang Kai-shek's Puppets' Tricks for Promoting Counterfeit Currency
    [This newspaper Changzhi dispatch] The anti-counterfeit currency struggle in various parts of Taihang has been going on universally for the past three months of August, September, and October, and has achieved considerable success and experience. According to reports from various places: the counterfeit currencies seized include three types of Jinan Bank Taihang version, Pingyuan version, and Luxi Bank version, with as many as seventeen styles. In addition to directly dispatching special agent merchants and using various methods to invest in our liberated area market, Chiang Kai-shek's puppets also organized fleeing landlords to use kinship relationships to secretly set up counterfeit currency promotion stations in our area, transporting and selling counterfeit currencies in large quantities. There are many specific methods for carrying and promoting them; according to the confession of Wang Zhaoni, a counterfeit currency criminal arrested in Xingtai: the main method of promotion is at night, mixed with new Ji banknotes. Counterfeit currency criminals in Wu'an mostly take cars to transport them into the interior, so no one intercepts them along the way. In addition, they take advantage of the chaos and difficulty in management of our temple fairs and markets to promote them. A total of 95 cases of counterfeit currency were seized in Xingtai City, involving 2,047,500 yuan. The counterfeit currencies seized in Yuanshi, Shimen, Gaoyi, and Jingxing areas are worth more than 10 million yuan. A counterfeit currency manufacturing plant was also discovered in northern Henan, organized by the big traitor Guo Qing of Zhangda, printing a large number of thousand-yuan and hundred-yuan notes, and using the power of soldiers to promote them to the liberated areas.

　　太行开展反假票斗争
    揭露蒋伪推销假票花样
    【本报长治讯】太行各地之反假票斗争经八、九、十、三个月来普遍进行，已获得不少成绩和经验。综合各地报导：查获之假票冀南银行太行版、平原版、鲁西银行版三种，式样达十七种之多。蒋伪除直接派遣特务奸商，用各种方法投入我解放区市场外，更组织逃亡地主利用亲友关系在我区秘设假票推销站，大批运销假票。其携带推销之具体办法甚多；据邢台查获之假票犯王逆兆供：主要推销办法是在夜间，夹杂于新冀钞间，武安之各种假票犯多专乘坐汽车运进内地，故沿路无人查获，此外并乘我庙会、市场乱杂、难于管理时推销。邢台市三来共查获假票案九十五起，票二百零四万七千五百元。元氏、石门、高邑、井陉一带查获之假票在千万元以上。豫北并发现假票制造所一处，由漳大汉奸郭清主办，印刷大批千元、百元券，利用兵士权关系向解放区推销。
