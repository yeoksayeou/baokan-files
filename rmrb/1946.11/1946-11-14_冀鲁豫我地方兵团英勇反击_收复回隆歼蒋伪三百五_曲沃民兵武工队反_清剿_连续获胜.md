The local militia, work team, and guard platoon immediately ambushed them in Wanhucun. After an hour of fierce fighting, more than ten were killed or wounded. They then took advantage of the victory to move north, occupying the Yulinshan heights. That afternoon, a platoon of Chiang's army, which had attacked from the Linfu Highway, passed through Kouzili and Suzhai and attacked Yulinshan again, also encountering an ambush. The Chiang's army launched three consecutive fierce attacks, but were all repulsed. The fierce battle continued until 3:00 p.m. before a tactical transfer was made. In this battle, more than 30 Chiang's soldiers were killed or wounded, while we had two wounded and one sacrificed.
