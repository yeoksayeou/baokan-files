Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 26th – According to the US News Service: "The strike of 400,000 coal miners in the United States is virtually certain." Washington officials announced on the 23rd that 92% of the nation's bituminous coal industry had been shut down. United Press reporters stated: "In more than ten steel industry cities, blast furnaces supplying crucial steel to the country have been shut down. The major coal strike will immediately extend to the unemployment of hundreds of thousands of workers outside the coal industry. The lack of steel and coal will likely cause the automobile industry to shut down within two weeks, and the machine industry will be similarly affected. Other industries that use coal but not steel will shut down somewhat later. The Department of the Interior announced that there is now only a 37-day supply of coal." In blizzard-stricken Colorado, schools have been closed. In twenty-one districts of Columbia, lights have been dimmed, and the streets are dark at night. Government authorities have sued mine worker leader Lewis in court. Lewis appeared in court on the 25th to defend the legitimacy of his strike order. According to the US News Service in Washington: "Observers here fear that if Lewis is sentenced to imprisonment, there is a possibility that labor will hold a nationwide sympathy strike. If so, the direct consequences will be violence, bloodshed, and suffering." Over the weekend, more than 10,000 anthracite miners held a sympathy strike.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 24th – According to various reports: The major US coal strike has rapidly affected national economic life. According to United Press on the 22nd: This snowballing strike is bound to quickly affect the automobile and all other industries. The production of all major industries is entirely dependent on the supply of steel, and steel has no storage due to the strike earlier this year. It can only rely on a continuous supply, which is in danger of imminent shutdown due to the coal strike. The United States currently has only 57 million tons of coal in storage, which usually lasts for five weeks. Most steel mills were already in dire straits when the coal strike began. Two of the seven blast furnaces at the Youngstown (Ohio) steel plate and pipe plant have been closed, and three more will be closed this weekend. Fourteen of its twenty-two open-hearth furnaces will also be closed. The assembly line at the Ford Motor Company has slowed down. Other automakers are following suit, resulting in hundreds of thousands of auto workers being laid off or only having part-time work this weekend. Railways have announced that they will greatly reduce train services. The US government issued an order on the 22nd to cities in several eastern states to implement "electricity saving" emergency measures from 6 pm on the 25th, prohibiting outdoor fuel use and reducing the supply of electricity to heating equipment and elevators. According to White House officials, the continuation of the coal strike will cause 25 million people to lose their jobs. Truman has cancelled his vacation and rushed back to Washington for this reason.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an – According to "US News" weekly: Since the end of the war in the United States, strikes have sprung up, causing a sharp decline in production. Steel production has been reduced by 11.5 million tons, nearly one-fifth of the annual output. Other reductions include 2.9 million vehicles (including passenger cars and trucks), 11.3 million tons of bituminous coal, and 310,000 tons of timber. This strike, like the Pacific Coast seafarers' and the Atlantic Coast National Union of Marine Cooks and Stewards' strike, which ended victoriously late last month, will seriously affect the US transportation industry again.

　　美国煤矿工潮继续扩大
    四十万矿工走出矿场
    全美百分之九十二烟煤业已经停工煤业以外数十万工人亦将因此失业
    【新华社延安二十六日电】据美新闻处讯：“美国四十万煤矿工人罢工实际上已确定无疑。”华府官方于二十三日宣布，全国百分之九十二烟煤业已停工。合众社记者称：“十余钢铁业城市中，供给全国重要钢铁的鼓风炉业已停火了。煤矿大罢工即刻将扩及煤业以外的数十万工人失业。钢与煤的缺乏，又将使汽车工业可能在两周内停业，机器业也将受同样影响。其他不用钢而用煤的工业，稍迟亦将停业。内政部宣布，现在只有供给三十七天的存煤。”在风雪交加的科罗拉多州，各学校已关闭。哥伦比亚二十一个区已灭弱灯火，入夜街道黯然。政府当局已向法庭控诉矿工领袖路易斯，路氏已于二十五日出庭辩护其通令罢工之正当理由。据美新闻处华府电称：“此间观察家唯恐一旦路易士被判下狱，劳工方面有举行全国性的同情罢工之可能。如是，则其直接后果将为暴力流血和痛苦。”上周末，无烟煤矿工一万余已举行同情罢工。
    【新华社延安二十四日电】据各方报导：美煤矿大罢工已迅速影响全国经济生活。据合众社二十二日称：这种滚雪球似的愈滚愈大的罢工，势将迅速波及汽车及其他一切工业，所有主要工业的生产完全依赖钢铁的供应，而钢铁则因今年初的罢工而毫无存储，只能靠源源不断的生产，这种生产已因煤矿罢工有迅即停顿之虞。全美现有存煤仅五千七百万吨，通常可供五星期之用。大部分钢铁厂当煤矿罢工开始时，便已困苦不堪。阳斯顿（俄亥俄州）钢板钢管厂之七座鼓风炉已封闭两座，本周末又将封闭三座。其二十二座敞口炉亦将封闭十四座，福特汽车工厂之装配间已将工作减缓。其他汽车厂亦相继效法，结果所致，本周末有数十万汽车工人将被解雇或只有部分工作可做。铁路方面已宣布将大大减少烽车班次。美政府已于二十二日下令东部数州各城，自二十五日下午六时起履行“节电”紧急措施，禁止户外燃料用光，并减少对暖气设备及升降机用电之供应。据白宫官员称：煤矿罢工的延续，将使二千五百万人失业。杜鲁门已为此取消休假，速赶回华府。
    【新华社延安电】据“美国新闻”周刊称：美国自战争结束后，罢工风起云涌，使生产锐减。计钢减产达一千一百五十万吨，几达全年产额五分之一。其他减产者有汽车（包括客车及卡车）二百九十万辆，烟煤一万一千三百万吨，木材三十一万吨，此次罢工将和上月下旬胜利结束的太平洋岸海员及大西洋岸全国海员厨师膳务工人工会的罢工一样，使美国运输业又受严重影响。
