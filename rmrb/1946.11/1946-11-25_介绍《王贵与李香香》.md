Introducing "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang"
    Yu
    Amidst the call to "Defend the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, Defend Yan'an!", we introduce this long poem of thousands of lines based on a folk revolutionary historical story from the Sanbian region. The value of this poem has been clearly explained in Comrade Lu Dingyi's article. Here, we will only talk about why we are reprinting this poem. In the previous issue of this edition, we called for more works that frontline soldiers could understand or listen to, and we believe this poem can achieve such a purpose. This is because it is not only a literary form familiar and easy to understand for the common people, but also writes about how the liberated people will never be conquered or overwhelmed by reactionary forces. Furthermore, Wang Gui's noble fighting qualities can serve as a powerful encouragement and example for the current self-defense war. Therefore, we are publishing it in three installments, hoping it will be widely disseminated.
    "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang," this folk revolutionary and love story, is written in the form of the folk song "Shun Tian You." "Shun Tian You" is the most popular tune in the border region, a type of poem with the simplest form: some have one verse (two lines) expressing one meaning, and some have several verses (commonly ten or twenty or so) connected into a song with a plot. Its characteristic lies in the vivid use of folk vocabulary and ingenious metaphors to express the pure and simple real-life feelings of the peasants. The author's ability to skillfully use this simple folk form to create such a beautiful poem shows that he has truly "learned from the people" and become the best model of "being a primary school student of the people."
    It is said that the author, Comrade Li Ji, is from Guangdong and works in the Yanchi County government in Ningxia. Because he enjoys writing, he often contributes to the Liberation Daily. His "Old Yin-Yang Angrily Beats the Insect God," published in the Liberation Daily in 1944, and "The Romance of Bu Zhang Village," published in Sanbian last year, have both been well-received by a wide readership. This further illustrates that only by earnestly delving into reality and serving the masses can one truly understand the life of the people, appreciate their emotions, and write works that are loved by the masses. Such achievements cannot be attained by writers who superficially gather materials during brief visits to the countryside.
    The creative path that Comrade Li Ji has taken is worth our literary workers following, and his down-to-earth spirit of "learning from the people" is even more worth our learning from.
    As for the singing method of "Shun Tian You," we don't have the official sheet music on hand. To facilitate singing, we have noted down a tune that may not be accurate, and it is temporarily attached below. If any comrades know the original sheet music, please send it to us so that we can correct it.
    Supplementary note: The singing method of folk songs emphasizes the expression of emotions, and the rhythm is relatively free. Moreover, the length of the lyrics varies, and the original tune can be used flexibly during singing.

### 介绍《王贵与李香香》

　　介绍《王贵与李香香》
    雨
    在“保卫陕甘宁边区，保卫延安!”的号召声中，我们介绍了这首以三边民间革命历史故事为题材的千行长诗。这首诗的价值，在陆定一同志的文中已经介绍得很清楚。这里，只说说我们为什么要转载这首诗。在上一期本版上，曾经号召多有些为前线战士能看得懂或听得懂的作品出现，而这首诗，在我们认为是可以达到这样一个目的的。因为它不仅是老百姓所熟悉易懂的文艺形式，而且写出了翻了身的人民是决不会为反动势力征服和压倒的。还有王贵这种高尚的战斗品质，也可以作为目前自卫战争中有力的鼓励与奋斗的榜样。所以把它分三次登出，希望广为流传。
    《王贵与李香香》这个民间的革命和恋爱故事，是用民歌“顺天游”的形式写成的。“顺天游”是边区民间最流行的调子，是一种形式最简单的诗：有一首（两句）表明一个意思的，有若干首（常见的是十首二十首不等）连成一段有情节的歌唱的。它的特征在于生动地运用民间的语汇和精巧的比喻，表达农民纯朴的生活实感。作者能圆熟地运用了这个简单的民间形式创造了这么美的诗篇，足见他是真正的做到了“向人民学习”，成为“做老百姓的小学生”的最好模范。
    听说作者李季同志，是一位广东人，在宁夏盐池县政府工作。因为爱好写作，常向解放日报投稿。四四年在解放日报上发表的“老阴阳怒打虫郎爷”，及去年在三边出版的“卜掌村演义”，都受到广大读者的欢迎。这更说明了，只有踏踏实实地深入实际，为群众服务，才能够真正懂得人民的生活，体会人民的情感，写出为大众所热爱的作品。其成就，却不是下乡走马观花地搜集材料的作家们所能达到的。
    李季同志所走的这条创作道路，是值得我们文艺工作者追踪下去，他的踏实的“向人民学习”的精神，更值得我们学习。
    至于“顺天游”的唱法，手边没有正式的谱子，为了便于歌唱，记下了一个不一定准确的调子，暂且附在下面。如有同志能知道原谱，请寄来，我们好更正。
    附带说明：民歌的唱法，着重情感的表露，节拍比较自由。且词句长短不一，唱时可以按照原调灵活运用。
