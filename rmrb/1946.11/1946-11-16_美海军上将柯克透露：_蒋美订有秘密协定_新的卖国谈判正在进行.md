Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 13th. U.S. Assistant Secretary of the Navy Kenney and U.S. Navy Admiral Cooke, stationed in China, revealed in a joint press conference in Shanghai on the 12th that Chiang Kai-shek had concluded a secret, traitorous agreement with the United States in May, and new traitorous negotiations are underway. Kenney flew from the United States to Shanghai on the 9th, then flew to Qingdao and Beiping for "inspection," and returned to Shanghai on the 11th. He is scheduled to return to the United States via Okinawa on the 13th. According to an Associated Press report, Cooke revealed at yesterday's press conference that, according to the agreement concluded in May, the United States would use $15 million worth of equipment to restore China's naval docks. Of that, $5 million will be used for Shanghai. After questioning, Cooke stubbornly stated: "Shanghai cannot be considered a U.S. naval base, but only a place where the U.S. Navy enjoys certain conveniences (such as setting up a naval post office, coastal patrols, and medical and recreational facilities)." In response to a reporter's question, Kenney said: "I know nothing" about negotiations regarding the use of Taiwan's coastal docks by the United States. Cooke revealed that U.S. military families are continuing to come to China, but the number will be limited (due to a lack of suitable housing).

    美海军上将柯克透露：
    蒋美订有秘密协定
    新的卖国谈判正在进行
    【新华社延安十三日电】美国海军部助理肯尼与驻华美海军上将柯克十二日在上海联合招待记者时透露，五月间蒋介石曾对美国成立秘密的卖国协定，新的卖国谈判正在进行中。肯尼系于九日由美国飞抵上海，旋飞青岛、北平“视察”，于十一日返沪，并定于十三日经冲绳岛返国。据美联社报导：在昨日记者招待会上，柯克透露：按照五月间成立的协定，美国将以一千五百万美元的装备，恢复中国的海军船坞。其中五百万美元将用于上海。经盘诘后，柯克强词称：“上海不能认为是美国海军根据地，但只是美海军享有某些便利条件的地方（如设海军邮政局、海岸巡逻及医药娱乐设备）。”在答复记者质询时，肯尼称：关于美国使用台湾海岸船坞之谈判“概无所知”。柯克透露，美军家属仍继续来华，但人数当加以限制（因缺乏适当住处）。
