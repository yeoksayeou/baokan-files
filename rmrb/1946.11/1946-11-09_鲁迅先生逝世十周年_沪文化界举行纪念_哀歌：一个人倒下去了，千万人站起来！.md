Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 6th: A dispatch from Shanghai states: October 20th marked the tenth anniversary of Lu Xun's death, and the cultural circles here held a memorial service at Lu Xun's tomb in the International Cemetery. On the morning of that day, Lu Xun's tomb was surrounded by wreaths and elegiac couplets, and twelve evergreen pines stood proudly upright. In front of the tomb, young men and women from all walks of life, including workers and students, gathered in a dense crowd. Lu Xun's widow, Ms. Xu Guangping, and her son, Hai Ying, also attended. During the meeting, Mr. Guo Moruo, Mao Dun, Tian Han, Hu Feng, Ye Shengtao, Hong Shen, Xue Feng, Chen Baichen, Cao Jinghua and others spoke. They unanimously vowed their determination to fight for democracy. Mr. Tian Han said with grief and indignation: "Friends in Jing Kingdom felt that this cemetery should not be used for burial, and they wanted to design a tomb for him, but today we are not only building a tomb for Mr. Lu Xun, but also finding a better living environment for the people. We also have to risk another ten or eight years, or even more than ten years of blood, to prevent China from deteriorating and to prevent the outbreak of a third world war, just like the ten years since Mr. Lu Xun's death." Mr. Hong Shen said with choked sobs: "We will never bow to fascism, never be slaves to any imperialism, never violate the truth, and never violate your direction." Mr. Hong Shen then shouted: "Mr. Lu Xun, can you hear me!" Hundreds and thousands of people below then shouted: "Listen, Mr. Lu Xun! We will always learn from you and resolutely fight against the enemy." The meeting began with a dirge and ended with a dirge: "Listen! One person falls, but millions rise... Mr. is the mentor of the youth, the Chinese people hold high your banner, and your battle cry resounds throughout the Chinese land."

　　鲁迅先生逝世十周年
    沪文化界举行纪念
    哀歌：一个人倒下去了，千万人站起来！…………”
    【新华社延安六日电】沪讯：十月廿日为鲁迅逝世十周年，此间文化界曾假万国公墓鲁迅墓举行纪念。该日晨鲁迅墓前周围挂满了花圈和挽联，十二棵万年松昂然挺立。在墓前，工学等各界男女青年挤成黑压压一片。鲁迅夫人许广平女士及其子海婴亦亲临参加。会中郭沫若、茅盾、田汉、胡风、叶圣陶、洪深、雪峰、陈白尘、曹靖华诸先生都讲了话。一致宣誓为民主而斗争的决心。田汉先生悲愤地说：“荆国的朋友都觉得不该用这块墓地来葬，他们要替他设计墓样，但是我们今天不单是要替鲁迅先生建立墓地，更要为人民找到更好的生活园地，我们还要像鲁迅先生逝世十年中一样，还要拚着十年八年甚至比十年更多的血去阻止中国的恶化，阻止第三次世界大战的爆发”。洪深先生哽咽着说：“我们决不会对法西斯低头，决不会做任何帝国主义的奴隶，我们决不违背真理，我们决不违反你的方向”。洪深先生继高呼：“鲁迅先生你听见了没有”！下面千百个人紧接着喊：“听吧，鲁迅先生！我们永远学习你，和敌人坚决斗争下去”，会议在哀歌中开始又在哀歌中结束：“听！一个人倒下去，千万人站起来，……先生是青年的导师，中国人民高举起你的大旗、中国大地响遍了你的战号”。
