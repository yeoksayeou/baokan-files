　　An Ambush Without a Shot Fired
    Guerrilla Activities in the Juye Campaign
    Li Wen
    On the evening of October 29th, the annihilation battle against the Chiang Kai-shek troops invading north towards Juye commenced. A certain unit of guerrillas, active in the Fifth Subdistrict behind the Chiang Kai-shek army, rapidly moved to the Chiang army's line of communication – the Juye-Heze highway – to operate. On the 30th, a group of defeated Chiang Kai-shek soldiers retreated from the front line, their clothes disheveled, dejectedly fleeing south. The sound of pursuit fire receded further and further, and the defeated soldiers' hearts, pounding with fear, gradually calmed down. At the entrance to the village of Macunji (only 35 li away from the Chiang army's garrison in Heze), a sentinel with American equipment stood faintly visible. Seeing them, he asked, "Which unit are you from?" The defeated soldiers hurriedly replied, "We are from the Dingtao Security Regiment!" "Brothers, you've worked hard fighting!" The other party offered words of comfort. "Having been a soldier for so many years, I've never fought such a losing battle! The 'Communist' artillery is truly formidable!" "Brothers, quickly enter the village to rest!" "Yes! Yes!" the defeated soldiers agreed, crowding into the village in disorder.

    "Which one of you is the officer? We are all on the same side, let's not have any misunderstandings." A person in a neat American military uniform greeted the visitors politely. "Brother, I am the platoon leader, we are one platoon." The Chiang Kai-shek platoon leader stood up proudly, but suddenly his face turned green. He noticed that the three machine guns at the village entrance, with their covers removed, were staring at them. In the ranks of American-dressed men, gray-uniformed Eighth Route Army soldiers also appeared. "Platoon, assemble! Line up!" The man wearing an American military hat ordered sternly. The Chiang Kai-shek platoon leader hesitated, but finally assembled the entire platoon of defeated soldiers. Thus, an ambush without a shot fired concluded. Thirty-eight Chiang Kai-shek soldiers, along with three officers including the battalion headquarters adjutant, quartermaster, and platoon leader, became prisoners of the guerrillas, bringing with them a machine gun and two grenade launchers as a greeting gift.

　　一枪未发的伏击战
    鄄城战役中的游击队活动
    力文
    十月二十九日晚，对北犯鄄城蒋军的歼灭战打响了，活跃在蒋军后方五分区的游击队某部，迅速的转移至蒋军作战的交通线——鄄（城）荷（泽）公路上活动。三十日，一群蒋军败兵从前线溃退下来，衣帽不整，垂头丧气的向南窜逃。追击枪声愈离愈远，败兵们惊怕剧跳的心也渐渐的平静下来。前边马村集（距荷泽蒋军驻地仅三十五里地了）的村头上，隐约的站站一个美式装备的哨兵，瞧见了他们，问道：“你们那一部分？”败兵连忙答道：“我们是定陶保安团的！”“弟兄们打仗辛苦啦！”对方发出了慰问。“当了这些年兵，没打过这样的败仗！“共军”的炮火，可真是惹不起！”“弟兄们快进村休息吧！”“对！对！”败兵们答应着，无次序的向村里拥。
    “那一位是官长？咱们都是自家人，不要发生误会。”一位穿着整齐的美式军服的主人客气的招呼着来客。“兄弟，我是排长，我们是一排人。”蒋军排长昂昂然的站出来，但突然他的面色发青了，他觉察到村口的三挺去掉枪衣的机枪瞪着眼看他们，美式装束的行列里，又出现了灰色军衣的八路军。“全排集合、站队！”一位带着美国军帽的主人，强硬的命令着。蒋军排长迟疑的，但终于把全排败兵集合好了。一枪未发的伏击战就这样结束了。三十八名蒋军，和营部副官、军需、排长等三个军官，作了游击队的俘虏，并带给他们机枪一挺、掷弹筒两个，作为见面礼。
