　　Taihang Experiences Three Months of Mass Movement
    Farmers' Associations and Militia Double in Size
    Broad Masses of Middle Peasants and Honest Peasants Flood into Organizations

    [Report from this newspaper] After the thorough liquidation and emancipation movement of the peasants in Taihang since August, the number of organized peasants in the entire region has doubled compared to before. According to statistics from 376 villages in Shahe, Heshun, Anyang, and Wu'an counties, before July there were more than 26,500 members of farmers' associations, which has now increased to more than 50,100. The militia has increased from more than 6,300 to more than 10,600. These masses were organized under two circumstances: one is that there were farmers' associations before the movement, but most were not sound, and they were transformed and strengthened in this movement, such as Fengjiazhuang in Pingding. The other is that there were no farmers' associations before the movement, and they gradually developed from grievance-airing groups and emancipation groups into formal farmers' associations during the movement, such as Tanghe Village in Qixian County. One of the main reasons for the organizational expansion is the absorption of a large number of middle peasants and honest peasants to participate in farmers' associations and the militia. According to statistics from 35 villages in Shahe, among the 70% of newly added members of farmers' associations, middle peasants account for 50%. Among the 50% of newly added militia, middle peasants account for 48%. The second is the mobilization of women. Before July, there were only more than 11,000 members of the Wu'an Women's Federation, which has now increased to more than 20,000. Among the 29 activists in Dongguan, Heshun, women account for 10. Due to the participation of the broad masses of women, the organized emancipation ranks have become even stronger.

　　太行经过三个月群运
    农会民兵壮大一倍
    广大中农与老实农民涌入组织
    【本报讯】太行农民经过了八月以来的彻底清算翻身运动，全区有组织的农民，较前增加一倍。据沙河、和顺、安阳、武安四县的三百七十六村统计，七月前有农会会员二万六千五百余人，现增至五万零一百余人。民兵由六千三百余增至一万零六百余。这些群众是在两种情形下组织起来的：一个是运动前就有农会组织，但多不健全，在此次运动中得到改造而壮大起来，如平定冯家庄等。一个是运动前没有农会组织，在运动中由诉苦小组、翻身小组逐渐发展成正式农会，如祁县唐河底等。组织壮大的主要原因之一，是吸收广大中农和老实农民参加农会和民兵。据沙河三十五村统计，新增的百分之七十农会会员中，中农即占百分之五十。新增百分之五十民兵中，中农占百分之四十八。其次是发动妇女，武安妇联会员，七月前才一万一千多人，现已增至两万多人。和顺东关二十九个积极分子中，妇女就占十个。由于广大的妇女群众参加，遂使有组织的翻身队伍更加壮大。
