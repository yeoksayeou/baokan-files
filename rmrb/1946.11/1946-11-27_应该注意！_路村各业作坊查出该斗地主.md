　　Pay Attention!
　　Landlords Discovered in Various Workshops in Lucun
　　[Reported from Yangcheng on the 22nd by our newspaper] After receiving the notice from the Tunliu Second District Farmers' Association regarding "clearing out the targets of struggle in the production departments," Lucun immediately convened a meeting of village cadres to study and inspect the situation. As a result, fifteen targets of struggle, including Song Zhenshan, were identified from ten production departments (such as flour mills, oil presses, etc.). They were immediately handed over to the Farmers' Association for handling by the masses. During the meeting, village cadres also deeply examined the reasons for this phenomenon, mainly the cadres' ideological confusion, pity for the targets of struggle, and the prevalence of counter-revolutionary ideas. Huo Qinghai, chairman of the Farmers' Association, said: "I used to think that they were really pitiful, and as long as they didn't do bad things now, they should be spared. Who knew they would be afraid of you on the surface but stab you in the back, the masses had to teach them a lesson.” Huo Huahai, a member of the Farmers' Association, said: "We shout about serving the masses every day, but there is a pile of struggle targets hidden in the production departments. It's really like letting wolves into the house and eating our own people." Through this reflection, the cadres gradually raised their vigilance.

　　应该注意！
    路村各业作坊查出该斗地主
    【本报阳城二十二日电】屯留二区路村接到县农会关于“清除生产部门中的斗争对象”的通知，立即召开村干部会议，研究检查，结果从十个生产部门（如粉坊、油坊等）清查出宋振山等十五个斗争对象。当即交给农会，由群众处理。村干部并在会议中深刻检讨造成这种现象的原因，主要是干部的思想混乱，可怜斗争对象与变天思想在作祟，农会主席霍庆孩说：“以前觉得人家实在可怜，只要现在不做坏事，就应该饶了他，谁知他明里怕你，暗里拿刀刺你，非要群众教训不可”。农会委员霍华孩说：“咱天天喊着为群众服务，而生产部门中却藏着一堆斗争目标，真是引狼入室，吃自己人。”经过此次反省，干部逐渐提高了警惕。
