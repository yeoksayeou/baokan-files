    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, November 11th: Tokyo dispatch: The month-long strike by Japanese electrical workers has brought almost all factories in Kyushu, Japan's largest industrial center, to a standstill. Currently, electricity is only supplied by 250,000 kilowatts/hour from hydropower and 120,000 kilowatts/hour from thermal power, while the total demand is 500,000 kilowatts/hour each from hydropower and thermal power. 42,300 members of the striking electrical workers' union, 95 percent of whom have rejected the compromise plan proposed by the Central Labor Relations Committee. Direct negotiations between labor and management have also failed because the company's general manager refused to attend, thus making the hope of an early resolution of the strike very slim.

    日本电气工潮
    短期尚难解决
    【新华社延安十一日电】东京讯：历时一月的日本电气工人的罢工，已使日本最大的工业中心九州，几乎全部工厂已停工。现在电力仅有水力发电二十五万基罗瓦特小时，及火力发电十二万基罗瓦特小时，而总需要量则为水力与火力各五十万基罗瓦特小时。罢工之电力工会会员达四万二千三百人，其中百分之九十五均拒绝中央劳工关系委员会所提出的妥协计划。劳资间之直接谈判亦因公司方面总经理拒绝出席而告失败，从而使罢工之早日解决希望甚微。
