　　Taihang Military Region Administrative Office's Emancipation Team
    Helps 40,000 People Achieve Liberation
    Now Returns Victoriously and is Summarizing Work
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The thirty-four cadres of the Taihang Military Region Administrative Office's Emancipation Team, who were working on both sides of the Wu Zhi and Qin River, returned victoriously on the 24th of last month and held a summary meeting at the Military Region Political Department on the 27th. They coordinated with county and district cadres to mobilize the masses in forty-three villages, changing 11 percent of all rural land, enabling 30 percent of the farmers to obtain 9,223 mu of land. Combined with the redemption of land in the past, the goal of "land to the tiller" has been initially realized. Due to the adoption of a policy of combining ideological mobilization with struggle action, the mass movement in Wuzhi developed rapidly and vigorously. In 156 emancipation struggle meetings, nearly 40,000 people were drawn into the movement, accusing 496 local bullies and landlords of their crimes. Political Commissar Liu of the sub-district praised it as "a new style of letting go." The fruits of the struggle were distributed by the masses according to their needs, with over 80 percent of the farmers benefiting. In addition to land, more than 2,000 houses, over 1,700 shi of grain, and over 200 head of livestock were completely distributed to the poor masses. As the climax of the movement initially concluded, they also helped two districts complete the enlistment of 300 new soldiers within two days. The relationship between the Emancipation Team and the local government and people was extremely harmonious. Comrade Wang Yuncheng and others conducted talks while helping the masses with harrowing and weeding, discovering problems. They took nothing from the fruits of the struggle. The masses also regarded the Emancipation Team as family, protecting their safety and taking care of the sick, very thoughtfully. The masses said, "Chairman Mao pointed out a bright road for the poor, and fearing that we could not see it, he sent you to lead us from nowhere to the broad road." When the Emancipation Team finished its work and left, the masses held them back, wanting to "write a letter to Chairman Mao, not letting the Emancipation Team leave," and finally waved goodbye with tears outside the village. In the summary review, all comrades felt that they had taken an eighty-three-day bath in the intense and arduous new district mass movement tide, and were different from when they went down, full of vigor. Some comrades' personal problems were overcome, they experienced the suffering of the peasants, and recognized the complete justice of the peasants' land demands. Comrades such as Guo Fuxuan, who were previously dissatisfied because their families had been struggled against, now have a clear understanding. Through this period of unity and cooperation, army and local cadres have also gained a better understanding of each other. In order to more deeply absorb experience, detailed summaries are now being carried out separately in the administrative office and the political department of the military region, and the emancipation diaries initiated in the movement are also being collected and organized, ready to be sent to literary magazines first.

　　太行军区行署翻身队
    帮助四万群众翻身
    现已胜利归来正总结工作
    【本报特讯】在武陟沁河两岸工作的太行军区行署翻身队全体干部三十四人，已于上月二十四日胜利归来，二十七日假军区政治部进行总结。他们协同县区干部发动了四十三个村的群众，变动了农村全部土地百分之十一，使百分之三十的农民获得土地九千二百二十三亩，连过去赎地倒产，已初步实现“耕者有其田”。由于采用了思想发动与斗争行动结合的放手方针，使武陟群运发展得迅速而猛烈。在一百五十六次翻身斗争大会上，将近四万群众卷入运动，控诉了四百九十六个恶霸地主的罪恶。分区刘政委曾誉为“新作风手放得展”。斗争果实则由群众根据需要，随斗随分，分百之八十以上农民获得了利益。除土地外，二千余间房屋，一千七百多石粮食，二百多头牲口完全分给了穷苦群众。运动高潮初步结束，又帮助两个区在两天内完成三百名新战士参军。翻身队与当地政民关系极为融洽，王运成同志等都是在帮助群众拉耙、拔草中进行谈话，发现了问题。对斗争果实做到了丝毫不取。群众对翻身队也看得像一家人，保护安全，照顾病号，非常周到。群众说：“毛主席给穷人指了光明大道，还怕俺们看不见，又派你们把俺们从没路处引上大路。”翻身队工作结束离开时，群众拉住不放，要“写信给毛主席，不让翻身队走”，最后挥泪送出村外。在总结检讨中，全队同志均感觉在紧张艰苦的新区群运大浪潮中洗了八十三天澡，与下去时不同了，充满朝气。有些同志的个人问题克服了，体验了农民痛苦，认识了农民土地要求的完全正义。郭辅轩等同志以前因家庭被斗而不满，现在思想也打通了。经过这一时期团结合作，军队与地方干部相互间也有了更好了解。为更深刻接受经验，现正在行署及军区政治部分别详细总结，在运动中发起的翻身日记，也正在收集整理，准备先送一部分给文艺杂志。（太行军区行署翻身队）
