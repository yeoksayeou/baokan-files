　　Zhang Qingshan Achieves His Wish
    Beacon of Light
    Comrade Zhang Qingshan is the squad leader of the first squad, fifth platoon, of the first company. During the Junan Campaign, he resolved to seize a machine gun. On the morning of the 1st, he saw that the third platoon had obtained two heavy machine guns and two light machine guns, and he mobilized his entire squad, saying, "Let's work hard, no one can be a coward, we must compete with the second platoon!"
    The defeated enemy tried to break through. At this moment, Comrade Zhang Qingshan, as if flying, led the soldiers to charge, running and fighting all the way, chasing the enemy into their village. The enemy still wanted to resist, but were quickly targeted by machine guns, and four "yellow beasts" lost their lives. Turning around to block the entrance, he ordered the enemy, "Hand over your guns quickly! Surrender your weapons and you won't be killed, you will even be treated leniently!" The embarrassed enemies all threw out their guns. At this time, Comrade Zhang Qingshan looked around and saw ninety men in American uniforms, ten light machine guns, six grenade launchers, and three submachine guns. Only then did his heart settle down with joy.

　　张庆山达到了心愿
    之光
    张庆山同志——是一中队五小队一班长，在鄄南战役时，他下定缴挺机枪的决心。一号上午，他见到三排得了两挺重机枪，两挺轻机枪，便向他全班动员：“咱们好好干，谁也不能耍孬种，非和二排比赛不可！”
    残败的敌人想突围，此刻张庆山同志，飞也似的带着战士们冲，随跑随打，一直追到敌人村里，敌人还想抵抗，早被机枪对准，四只黄兽丧了命。转身堵住门口，命令敌人“快缴枪，缴枪不杀，还优待。”狼狈的敌人，统统把枪都投出来，这时张庆山同志看了看，九十个穿美国军装的，十挺轻机枪，六个掷弹筒，三支手提枪，他的心才高兴的安下来。
