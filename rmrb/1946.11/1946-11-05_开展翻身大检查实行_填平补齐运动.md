　　Since our Party implemented the land reform policy of "land to the tiller," it has immensely excited the broad masses and cadres. Over the past six months, we have created many experiences and achieved great results. In about two-thirds of the region, among twenty million people, the principle of "land to the tiller" has been realized. The intensity of the movement and the scale of its grandeur are unprecedented. We have grasped the principle of uniting with the middle peasants, taking care of the majority, and gaining the sympathy and support of over 90% of the people. However, we are still far from fully realizing "land to the tiller," and we must continue our efforts to implement it thoroughly, striving to achieve full realization this winter and spring. At this crucial moment in the War of Patriotic Self-Defense, when the Chinese nation is at a historical turning point, in order to defeat the reactionary forces of the US and Chiang Kai-shek, realize the January Truce Order and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and strive for China's peace, democracy, and independence, it is even more necessary to mobilize all peasants to realize "land to the tiller" to guarantee victory. This is the most urgent task. Therefore, we must continue to boldly mobilize the masses to solve the land problem, overcome any obstacles and worries, and persist in this reform movement to the end.
    Based on the progress and situation of the land reform movement in our region, the main key is still how to continue to boldly mobilize the peasants, rather than the problem of excesses. In some areas, the land reform movement has been vigorous and achieved great results. The leadership was once intoxicated by these achievements, and without detailed research and inspection, declared that the peasant masses had been thoroughly turned over and that the land reform movement had been completed, and then stopped the reform movement and turned to production. This is not right. In the past, mass movements rose and fell several times. One of the main reasons was that the achievements of the mass movement were overestimated at a decisive moment when problems were really being solved, and implementation was relaxed. As a result, the land problem was not solved, and the mass movement declined. It is well known that there is an ancient saying: "One who travels a hundred li considers ninety as half." This experience and lesson must be remembered. Some comrades equate the agreement of peasants to obtain land and realize "land to the tiller" with taking care of the lives of other strata of society, unduly emphasizing care too much, and wanting to put the mass movement on the "right track" and make it "civilized and polite," which hindered the progress of the mass movement. Mobilizing the masses to carry out land reform is a great revolutionary movement. It is necessary to disrupt the old order of feudal society. It must be disrupted, otherwise a new revolutionary order cannot be established. Some areas stubbornly insist on first reducing rent and increasing wages, training backbones, and then carrying out large-scale mobilization, or only first carrying out anti-traitor liquidation without solving the land problem, mechanically dividing the mass movement into several stages, which also limits the scale and speed of the mass movement. In fact, all localities can adopt a package of struggle methods according to the immediate needs of the masses, and accomplish it in one go, from anti-traitor liquidation and rent reduction to the realization of "land to the tiller."
    Since the surrender of the Japanese invaders, the movement for land reform to realize "land to the tiller" launched in the new areas has largely completed its development phase or will soon be completed. This is a great achievement. All localities can, according to the specific development situation, enter the in-depth and consolidation stage at an appropriate time, and launch a widespread and in-depth overturn inspection from bottom to top to see if the masses have been thoroughly overturned, whether there are landlords falsely selling or falsely distributing or pretending to be enlightened, deceiving the masses, whether there are landlords bribing cadres, or cadres being embarrassed and not thoroughly liquidating, whether there are unfair distribution phenomena, whether cadres, activists and militia have obtained land, and other vast peasant masses have not obtained land or have obtained very little land, etc. Inspections should be carried out household by household; continue to implement land reform, realize "land to the tiller," draw from the more and supplement the less, draw from the rich and supplement the poor, land-poor supplement land, house-poor supplement houses, and implement a "filling and leveling movement" once. The contents are: (1) Repeatedly check for landlords and despots who have been missed, hidden, or shielded by cadres, and their land should be cleared out and distributed to landless or land-poor peasants. (2) During the large-scale development phase, there was insufficient care for the masses. Cadres, activists, and militia have obtained too much land, becoming detached from the masses, and they should be patiently and kindly persuaded to take out a portion and give it to the masses in order to strengthen internal unity, but it must be done consciously and voluntarily. (3) If the disparity between the amount of land in rich villages and poor villages is too great, and the poor villages do not have enough land to distribute, and the peasants in the poor villages only get very little or even no arable land, then ways should be found to transfer some land from the rich villages to the poor villages. The transfer method can be to adopt joint struggles by several villages or merge poor and rich villages into one administrative unit, fight together, distribute together, or the rich villages sell part of the land to the poor villages at a discounted price, or adopt donations and other methods. (4) In this movement, special attention should be paid to taking care of the middle peasants and taking care of industrialists and businessmen. Do not infringe on their interests.
    Should the old areas also have a "filling and leveling movement"? In areas where "land to the tiller" has been thoroughly implemented, do not carry out the "filling and leveling movement," but focus on production. However, investigations and research must be carried out to clear up the tail end. Individual land problems that have not been resolved should be resolved through mediation and arbitration. Internal disputes and disunity should also be resolved through mediation. Special attention should be paid not to harm the interests of middle peasants, wealthy middle peasants, and newly rich peasants who have developed during the Anti-Japanese War. However, in areas where the land problem has not been thoroughly resolved and where landlords have counterattacked, a "filling and leveling movement" can also be carried out based on the actual situation.
    In areas with tense War of Patriotic Self-Defense, land reform must be closely integrated with participation in the war and army and the development of guerrilla warfare. However, mobilizing the peasant masses to realize "land to the tiller" must be resolutely continued and must not be relaxed. Only by thoroughly realizing "land to the tiller" and thoroughly mobilizing all the peasant masses can we support a long-term war and achieve final victory. Relaxing or postponing land reform and mobilizing the masses for any reason will create a historical mistake.
    In terms of leadership, we must oppose taking over everything and guaranteeing the full implementation of the mass line, striving for the sympathy and support of over 90% of the people, which is an important key to mobilizing the masses. Many cadres commit acute illnesses, have a condescending attitude, simply distribute land, do not mobilize the masses, do not cultivate local cadres, are arbitrary and dictatorial, take over everything, issue administrative orders, and as soon as the work team leaves, the work collapses. Without conducting deliberation, they simply engage in the work, and as a result, the land problem is solved, the landlords are eliminated, and the masses cannot be mobilized, creating a blank area without land problems, or a clear distribution but a secret non-distribution, which makes later work more difficult. This bias must be overcome.

### 开展翻身大检查实行“填平补齐运动”

　　开展翻身大检查实行“填平补齐运动”
    自我党实行耕者有其田的土地改革政策以后，无限的兴奋了广大群众和干部，半年来创造了许多经验，获得很大成绩，全区约有三分之二地区两千万人口中间实现了耕者有其田，其运动之猛烈规模之雄伟为前所未有，掌握了团结中农，照顾多数，获得百分之九十以上的人同情和拥护，但距离全部实现耕者有其田尚远，还须继续努力，以求贯彻，争取于今冬明春全部实现。在此爱国自卫战争紧张进行，中华民族处于历史转折关头之际；为了战胜美蒋反动派，实现一月停战令和政协决议，争取中国的和平、民主与独立，就更加需要发动全体农民实现耕者有其田，使胜利有所保证，则更为当务之急，为此必须继续放手发动群众解决土地问题。要打破任何障碍和顾虑，坚持这一改革运动到底。
    根据我区目前土地改革运动的进展和情况观察：主要关键仍然是如何继续放手发动农民，而不是过火的问题，有些地区土地改革运动轰轰烈烈，成绩很大，领导上曾陶醉于这些成绩，未经详细研究检查，就宣布农民群众已彻底翻身，土地改革运动已经完成，遂停止改革运动，转入生产，这是不对的。过去群众运动几起几伏，其中主要原因之一，就是因为对群众运动成绩，在真正进入解决问题带有决定性的关头估计过高，放松贯彻，结果土地问题未解决，群众运动消沉下去。殊不知古有明训：“行百里者半九十”，此种经验教训必须记取，有些同志把同意农民获得土地实现耕者有其田和照顾其他各阶层人士的生活问题平列看待，不适当的过分强调照顾，想把群众运动纳入“正轨”做的“文明而有礼”，障碍了群众运动的进展。发动群众，进行土地改革，是一次伟大的革命运动，一定要把封建社会的旧秩序打乱，要乱一顿，否则就建立不起革命的新秩序来。有些地区固执先减租增资，锻炼出骨干后，再进行大发动，或只是先反奸清算不解决土地问题，把群众运动机械的分成几个阶段，亦限制了群众运动的规模和速度，实际上各地均可根据群众的切身要求，采取一揽子斗争方式，一气呵成，从反奸清算退租等一直实现耕者有其田。
    自从日寇投降以来，新区所发动的土地改革实现耕者有其田的运动，大发展阶段已经大体完成或不久即将完成，这一成绩是很大的。各地可按具体发展情况，在适当时期转入深入与巩固阶段，发动群众自下而上的进行，普遍深入的翻身大检查，看群众已否翻透了身，是否有地主假卖假分或假开明，欺骗群众情事，是否有地主买通干部，或干部碍于情面而未彻底清算，是否有分配不公现象，是否有干部积极分子和民兵得到土地，其他广大农民群众未得到或得到很少土地等现象。应按家检查；继续贯彻土地改革，实现耕者有其田，抽多补少，抽肥补瘦，地少补地，房少补房，实行一次填平补齐运动。内容（一）反复检查遗漏隐瞒或被干部包庇因而未清算之地主恶霸等，应将其土地清出，分给无地或少地的农民。（二）大发展阶段中照顾群众不够。干部积极分子和民兵得到土地过多，脱离群众，应耐心的善意的说服他们拿出一部分来交给群众，以便加强内部团结，但必须做到自觉自愿。（三）如因富村贫村土地多寡太悬殊，贫村土地不敷分配，贫村农民只得到很少或甚至得不到耕地，则应设法由富村向贫村转移一部分土地，其转移方法可采取数村联合斗争或合并贫富村为一行政单位，共同斗争，共同分配，或由富村折价卖给贫村一部分土地，或采赠送等方法均可。（四）在这一运动中，应特别注意照顾中农，照顾工商业家。不要侵犯他们的利益。
    老区是否也要来一次填平补齐运动呢？凡已彻底实行耕者有其田的地区，不进行填平补齐运动，以生产为主，但须进行调查研究清理尾巴，个别未解决的土地问题，用调解仲裁方式解决之，内部纠纷不团结问题，亦用调解方式解决之，特别注意，不要损害中农富裕中农和抗战中发展起来的新富农的利益。但解决土地问题不彻底和地主反攻的区域中，根据实际情况亦可进行一次填平补齐运动。
    在爱国自卫战争紧张的地区，土地改革必须与参战参军和开展游击战争密切结合。但对实现耕者有其田发动农民群众必须坚决继续贯彻，不能放松，只有彻底实现了耕者有其田，彻底发动了全体农民群众，才能支持长期战争，取得最后胜利，不管借口任何理由而放松或推迟土地改革发动群众，均将会造成历史的错误。
    在领导上，必须反对包办代替，保证完全执行群众路线，争取百分之九十以上的人同情和拥护，这是发动群众的重要关键。许多干部犯急性病，恩赐观点，单纯分配土地，不发动群众，不培养本地干部，独断专行，包办代替，行政命令，工作队一走，工作即垮台，不进行酝酿，简单从事，结果土地问题解决，地主消灭群众发动不起来，造成没有土地问题的空白区，或明分暗不分，给后来工作以更大困难，此种偏向必须克服。
