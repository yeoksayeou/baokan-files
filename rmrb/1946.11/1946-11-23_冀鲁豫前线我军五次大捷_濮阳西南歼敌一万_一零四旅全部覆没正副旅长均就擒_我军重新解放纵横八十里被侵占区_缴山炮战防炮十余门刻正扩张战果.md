　　[Urgent Dispatch from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Front, 21st of this month] At the same time that Chiang Kai-shek announced his so-called "ceasefire order," Gu Zhutong, disregarding the significant losses of a brigade and a half in Juancheng, ordered Sun Zhen of the Fifth Pacification Zone to launch a full-scale attack on our Puyang Liberated Area. Their vanguard reached areas near Liangmen Town (south of Puyang) and Baidaokou (west of Puyang), 60 li from Puyang. Our army immediately launched a counterattack on the morning of the 19th. By noon on the 20th, in approximately thirty hours, we recovered approximately eighty li of occupied territory, eliminating the entire 104th Brigade (except for one battalion), the headquarters and two battalions of the 125th Brigade, and the entire Hebei Security 12th Column. Over two thousand enemies were killed or wounded, and over seven thousand five hundred people were captured, including the commander of the 104th Brigade, Yang Xianming, and the deputy brigade commander of that brigade, as well as He Guansan, the commander of the column. More than ten mountain guns and anti-aircraft guns, more than ten vehicles, and a large number of other military supplies were seized. Our army is continuing to expand the victory, inflicting even heavier blows on the invading army.
