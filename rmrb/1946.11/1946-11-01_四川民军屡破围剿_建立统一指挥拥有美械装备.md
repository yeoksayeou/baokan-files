　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th: According to reports from Chongqing and Chengdu newspapers: The anti-"suppression" campaigns of the local people's armed forces in Sichuan have been repeatedly victorious. Several people's armies have established unified command structures and possess American equipment. The people's army in the Xuyong and Gulin area on the border of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces has shattered the "joint defense and suppression" of the Border Region Commissioner's Office of the three provinces since July, achieving great victories. Currently, Chen Xiangrong, Zeng Zirong, Yin Luozi, and other seventeen leaders of the people's army in the region have formed the "General Headquarters of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou," leading thousands of men, stationed in the border areas of various counties, forming a triangular formation. The people's army in Qijiang, Jiangjin, Tongzi, and Xishui counties on the border of Sichuan and Guizhou, in addition to the Chen Zhanrong brothers, also includes several units in Jigongshan, Guangxingchang, and Funiuchang in Qijiang County. Their composition is mostly demobilized soldiers and local poor people, and their weapons and clothing are mostly American-style. In September, the Sichuan-Guizhou security team and local militia once launched a suppression campaign, but to no avail. Later, the Chiang government organized the "Qijiang-Tongzi-Xishui Bandit Suppression Command Post," together with local militias, etc... to carry out another suppression campaign, and offered a reward of four million yuan to assassinate the Chen brothers, but suffered another disastrous defeat. The people's army centered on Huaying Mountain in Guang'an and Linshui counties in eastern Sichuan has become active again since the American-equipped 14th Army of the Chiang army left in July. In early August, the Chiang government organized the "Joint Bandit Suppression Office of Jiangjin, Changshou, Linshui, Hechuan, Wusheng, Guang'an, Yuechi and Seven Counties," concentrating the police of seven counties to "suppress" in several routes in early September. Most of the people's army had already safely withdrawn. Only a small part of Wu Weisans' troops fought fiercely with the "suppression" army at Wangjiachang on the mountain, and later also transferred victoriously. At the same time, the mutinous troops in Hechuan, Guang'an, and other counties were also active. The Zhai Bogai unit of the people's army in Benyang and Sangzhi counties on the border of Sichuan, Guizhou, Hunan, and Hubei has conducted twelve battles since August. After repeatedly repelling the Chiang army's offensive in the Eight-Faced Mountain and Huashiban areas in ×× area, they have all victoriously transferred on September 24. In addition, the people's army in Maoxian County in western Sichuan has recently grown to seven or eight hundred people, calling themselves the "National Salvation Army"; nearly a hundred people's army has been discovered in Lifan County, carrying new-style machine guns and other weapons. On October 2, they once attacked the county seat, fought with the police squadron to the outskirts of the city, killing the police captain ×× instructor Wei Yunlong and several policemen.
