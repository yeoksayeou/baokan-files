　　Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang (Conclusion)
    Folk Revolutionary Historical Story of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region
    Li Ji
    Wearing a gown and mandarin jacket, carrying a civilized cane,
    Master Cui is still the same old [character].
    Running to this house then that,
    "Trying to make a fortune off me, Cui, is in vain.
    "In previous dynasties, there were also rebels,
    These things are not rare.
    "There are strange things in the world, and the same in the sky,
    Even the celestial dog can eat the moon.
    "Eating through the mouth and excreting through the behind,
    The moon is still bright.
    "Since ancient times, one good overcomes all evil,
    Demons and monsters won't be rampant for long.
    "Who is the True Dragon Son of Heaven?
    The world of Siyangwan still belongs to the Cuis!"
    A leopard can't change its spots,
    Master Cui still desires Xiangxiang, his heart hasn't died.
    Sending Li Derui away on errands,
    Master Cui came to his house.
    Showing his teeth with just a smile:
    "Little Xiangxiang, I'm back again!
    "The past is all forgotten by me,
    Just be good and come with me.
    "Your Red Army old man has run off without a trace,
    Living as a widow pains my heart.
    "Don't be willful anymore, come with me
    You'll have food, clothing, and a good life."
    Xiangxiang was ashamed, angry, and scared,
    Lowering her head, she didn't speak.
    Master Cui thought she was acquiescing,
    His whole body itching, his heart like a burning fire.
    With no one in the house, Master Cui grew bold,
    Pinched her face.
    Going with the flow, he kissed her on the mouth,
    —In broad daylight, he wanted to commit adultery!
    Xiangxiang ran out in anger,
    Running and shouting.
    Smiling broadly, he blocked the door:
    "Women are truly muddle-headed when they do things."
    Saying this, he stepped forward again,
    Xiangxiang spat in his face.
    Kicking wildly with her feet, scratching with her hands,
    Two bloody scratches were left on Cui's face.
    The neighbors all came to watch the excitement,
    Master Cui ran back in embarrassment.
    Before leaving, he said to Xiangxiang:
    "What do you think you're accomplishing by making a scene?
    "Open the window, let's talk it out,
    This time, you will submit whether you want to or not!"
    2  Sheep's Belly Towel
    Master Cui has lost his conscience,
    Li Derui went on an errand and never returned.
    The old sparrow died, the male sparrow flew out of the nest,
    How can Xiangxiang live alone?
    Wanting to find the guerrillas,
    She can't escape the dog legs watching her.
    First sending rice, then sending flour,
    Master Cui wants to buy Xiangxiang's heart.
    Inviting this one and begging that one,
    Persuading her two or three times a day.
    Scaring her with hard words, coaxing her with soft words,
    Xiangxiang will never change her heart.
    Crying three times a day, nine times in three days,
    Even a heart of stone will soften.
    People don't shed tears unless they are heartbroken,
    The sheep's belly towel is soaked.
    The sheep's belly towel is a foot and a half long,
    Wring out the tears and cry again.
    The earthen slope behind the house,
    Looks out to the yellow sand nest outside the village.
    The sand ridge is high, the sand nest is low,
    Can't see where my loved ones are?
    Plant elm trees in front of the house,
    They don't grow tall, but their roots are thick.
    Grasp the elm tree and shake it a few times,
    Build me a bridge to peace of mind!
    Seen through the window, geese fly south,
    Xiangxiang's suffering is endless.
    "People say geese can carry messages,
    Send a few words to the one in my heart.
    "When you left, the trees were just budding,
    The leaves are gone, and you still haven't come home."
    "The horse won't go unless whipped,
    If you can't come back, send back a few words.
    "One lump of stone, two lumps of brick,
    Don't you know how difficult it is for your sister!
    "The sky is full of clouds, scattered by the wind,
    Our marriage has been disrupted.
    "Of the grains, none are rounder than peas,
    Of the people, none are more pitiful than us!
    "Of the crops, none are brighter than millet,
    Of the people, none are more miserable than us!
    "Thinking of you, I can't eat,
    The fire in my heart burns my mouth raw.
    "Millet in the sun-drenched hollow, valley in the sun-drenched hollow,
    Whenever I think of you, I cry.
    "Picking up the rice bowl, I think of you,
    Tears drip into the rice bowl.
    "Thinking of you in the first half of the night, I can't light the lamp,
    Thinking of you in the second half of the night, the sky doesn't dawn.
    "Thinking of you all night, I can't close my eyes,
    Your eyebrows and eyes are all over the kang.
    "Calling out to brother, come and save me quickly,
    If you come late, my life will be hard to keep!
    "If I die, don't be sad,
    Living or dead, I'm still your person.
    "High saddle, short stirrups, pull the chief,
    My soul will follow you."
    Aunt Liu has a kind heart,
    She stays with Xiangxiang when she's sad.
    Whenever she has time, she persuades Xiangxiang:
    "Poor child, don't be sad!
    "One day the guerrillas will return,
    Public and private grievances will be avenged together.
    "Capture Master Cui alive and tie him up,
    The dog legs and White Army will be swept away!"
    Thirty-three buckwheat kernels, ninety-nine ridges,
    Overcome with grief, Xiangxiang fell ill.
    When it doesn't rain, the crops change color,
    Her face turned yellow and thin, her appearance changed.
    Sick, she made a pair of shoes,
    With tears in her eyes, she gave them to Aunt Liu.
    "Aunt Liu, I entrust these shoes to you,
    After I die, you must deliver them to him!"
    "Send the shoes and carry the message:
    He can only wear this pair of shoes that I made!"
    3  Reunion
    Master Cui flew into a rage:
    "That dead girl doesn't appreciate me!"
    With a dark heart and crooked thoughts like a wolf,
    He resorted to violence to seize Xiangxiang.
    Seven dishes and eight bowls of banquet dishes were set out,
    The date was set: the twenty-first of the twelfth lunar month.
    Master Cui was marrying a concubine, the dog legs were busy,
    Those sitting at the feast were all platoon leaders.
    Each soldier was rewarded with five dimes,
    Guessing fingers and gambling, making a racket.
    Xiangxiang cried like a tearful person,
    The more she thought of her loved ones, the sadder she became.
    A red silk jacket, green satin trousers,
    Two or three wives forced her to wear them.
    Xiangxiang cried and cursed:
    "You, surnamed Cui, why don't you marry your old mother?
    "One day, if my wish is fulfilled,
    I'll stab you with a small knife!"
    Hearing it, he pretended not to hear,
    Master Cui was smoking opium on the kang.
    Having had his fill of opium, he went to check on the wine,
    Pushing and shoving like a pack of fighting dogs.
    You toast me, I toast you,
    The liquor was drunk into the dogs' bellies.
    You congratulate him, he congratulates him,
    Master Cui was just like their own father.
    Master Cui came smiling:
    "Simple wine and vegetables, everyone must forgive me!
    "I'm marrying this young wife, thanks to everyone,
    If you all don't help, there's no way!
    "She's just crying because she doesn't turn her brain,
    I'll have her make up for it when she's free.
    "This woman is naturally cheap,
    She doesn't like those with money, she wants a poor man.
    "The poor bone, Wang Gui, struggles and is strong,
    But he can't twist his arm against his thigh.
    "My marriage with her is a match made in heaven,
    Stirring things up from east to west, she hasn't escaped my grasp.
    "Speaking of which, I still say the same thing:
    Will the sun rise from the west?"
    Drinking and gambling, no sentry was posted at the entrance of the village,
    The guerrillas came over quietly!
    With the sound of gunfire, they shouted "Kill!"
    Our guerrillas are here!
    One man, one horse, one gun,
    Our guerrilla forces are strong!
    Broadswords, Mausers, red-tasseled spears,
    Mausers, rifles, smokeless steel.
    Which White Army soldier wants to fight?
    They obediently surrendered their guns to the guerrillas.
    Torches lit up, the whole village was bright,
    The peasants all came to welcome them.
    The platoon leaders had no soldiers, anxiously sitting at the banquet table,
    Master Cui was so scared he crawled into the kang cave.
    The company commander ran, grabbing the platoon leader,
    One by one, they were all tied up.
    Master Cui's whole body was soft and unsteady,
    They tied up an old man to look after the melons.
    The company commander jumped out over the wall,
    Unexpectedly, Niu Siwa grabbed him firmly.
    Hearing the gunfire, Xiangxiang laughed,
    Ten to one, it's our guerrillas who have come.
    People are refreshed by happy events,
    She got up and jumped off the kang.
    Walking quickly and anxiously,
    Where are my loved ones?
    The captain asked for leave,
    Wang Gui came to the upper courtyard to find her.
    The courtyard was full of torches, bright and clear,
    Where isn't my sister flourishing?
    Far away, she saw a new daughter-in-law,
    Wearing red on the upper body and green on the lower body.
    The horse has a good memory and isn't afraid of the long road,
    Xiangxiang won't forget Wang Gui's appearance.
    A sheep's belly towel around his neck,
    Who else could it be but my brother?
    The two of them faced each other, holding hands,
    It was hard to speak, hard to laugh, hard to open their mouths.
    A bellyful of words couldn't be spoken,
    It was as if, a towel was stuffed in their mouths.
    Struggling for a long time, Wang Gui finally said one sentence:
    "We're making revolution, and the revolution is also for us!"
    (The End)

　　王贵与李香香（续完）
    陕甘宁边区民间革命历史故事
    李季
    长袍马褂文明棍，
    崔二爷还是那个＠样子。
    东家溜来西家串，
    “想发我姓崔的洋财是枉然。
    “前朝古代也有人造反，
    这些事情不稀罕。
    “世上有怪事，天上也一样，
    天狗还能吃月亮。
    “嘴里吃来屁股里巴，
    月亮还是亮光光。
    “自古一正压百邪，
    妖魔作乱不久长。
    “真龙天子是个谁？
    死羊湾的天下还姓崔！”
    本性难改狗吃屎，
    崔二爷想香香，心还没有死。
    打发李德瑞去支差，
    崔二爷来到他家里。
    露着牙齿只是个笑：
    “小香香，我又回来了！
    “过去的事情，我全不记，
    只你乖乖的跟我去。
    “你那红军老汉跑得没影踪，
    活活守寡我心里不安生。
    “不要再任性，你跟上我
    有吃有穿真受活。”
    香香又羞又气又害怕，
    低着头来不说话。
    崔二爷当她顺从了，
    混身发痒心里似火烧。
    屋里没人崔二爷胆子大，
    照着脸上捏了一把。
    顺水推舟亲了一个嘴，
    ——大白天他想胡日鬼！
    香香气急往外跑，
    一边跑来一边叫。
    满脸笑着把门堵：
    “女人家做事真糊涂。”
    说着说着又上前，
    香香把唾沫吐了他一脸。
    双脚乱踢手乱抓，
    崔二脸上叫抓了两个血疤疤。
    邻居们都来看热闹，
    崔二爷害骚往回跑。
    临走对着香香说：
    “看你闹的算个啥？
    “打开窗子，把话说个明，
    这一回你从也要从，不从也要从！”
    ２  羊肚子手巾
    崔二爷他把良心坏，
    李德瑞支差一去不回来。
    老雀死了公雀飞出窝，
    香香一个人怎过活？
    有心去找游击队，
    狗腿子照着走不脱。
    先送米来又送面，
    崔二爷想把香香心买转。
    请上这个央那个，
    一天来劝两三遍。
    硬的吓来软的劝，
    香香至死心不变。
    一天哭三回，三天哭九回，
    铁石的心儿也变软。
    人不伤心不落泪，
    羊肚子手巾水淋淋。
    羊肚子手巾一尺五，
    拧干了眼泪再来哭。
    房子后边土坡坡，
    ＠见寨子外边黄沙窝。
    沙梁梁高来，沙窝窝低，
    照不见亲人在那里？
    房子前边种榆树，
    长的不高根子粗。
    手扒着榆树摇几摇，
    你给我搭个顺心桥！
    隔窗子＠见雁飞南，
    香香的苦处数不完。
    “人家都说雁儿会带信，
    捎几句话儿给我心上的人。
    “你走时树木才发芽，
    树叶尽你还不回家”。
    “马儿不走鞭子打，
    人不能回来捎上两句话。
    “一圪瘩石头二圪瘩砖，
    你不知道妹妹怎么难！
    “满天云彩风吹乱，
    咱俩的婚姻叫人搅散。
    “五谷里数不过莞豆圆，
    人里头数不过咱俩可怜！
    “庄稼里数不过糜子光，
    人里头数不过咱俩凄惶！
    “想你想的吃不进去饭，
    心火上来把嘴燎烂。
    “阳洼里糜子阳洼里谷，
    那达想起你那达哭。
    “端起饭碗想起了你，
    眼泪滴到饭碗里。
    “前半夜想你点不着灯，
    后半夜想你天不明。
    “一夜想你合不着眼，
    炕围子上边尽你眉眼。
    “叫一声哥哥快来救救我，
    来的迟了命难活！
    “我要死了你莫伤心，
    死活都是你的人。
    “马高镫短扯首长，
    魂灵儿跟在你身旁”。
    刘二妈来好心肠，
    香香难过她陪上。
    得空就来把香香劝：
    “可怜的娃娃，不要伤心！
    “有朝一日游击队回来了，
    公仇私仇一齐报。
    “活捉崔二爷拿绳绑，
    狗腿子白军一扫光！”
    三十三颗荞麦，九十九道棱，
    伤心过度，香香得了病。
    天不下雨，庄稼颜色变，
    面黄肌瘦变了容颜。
    带病做了一双鞋，
    含着眼泪交给刘二妈。
    “刘二妈，这双鞋托付你，
    我死后，一定要捎给他！”
    “送去鞋子把话捎：
    他只能穿我做这一双鞋子了！”
    ３  团圆
    崔二爷发了火：
    “死丫头这样不抬举我！”
    黑心歪尖赛虎狼，
    下了毒手抢香香。
    七碟子八碗摆酒席，
    看下的日子：腊月二十一。
    崔二爷娶小，狗腿子忙，
    坐席的净是连排长。
    当兵的每人赏了五毛钱，
    猜拳赌博闹翻天。
    香香哭的像泪人，
    越想亲人越伤心。
    红绸子袄来绿缎子裤，
    两三个老婆来强固。
    香香又哭又是骂：
    “姓崔的，你怎么不娶你老妈妈？
    “有朝一日遂了我心愿，
    小刀子扎你没深浅！”
    听见只当没听见，
    崔二爷当炕上抽洋烟。
    过足了烟瘾去看酒，
    推推让让活像一群咬架狗。
    你敬我来我敬你，
    烧酒喝在狗肚里。
    你恭喜来他恭喜，
    崔二爷好比是他亲大哩。
    崔二爷来笑嘻嘻：
    “薄酒蔬菜，大家要原谅哩！
    “我娶这小房，靠大家，
    众位不帮忙，就没法！
    “本来该叫她来敬敬酒，
    酬劳诸位多辛苦。
    “脑筋不转只是哭，
    往后闲了再叫她补。
    “这个女人本来贱，
    看不上有钱的要穷汉。
    “穷骨头王贵挣又强，
    胳膊扭大腿他犯不上。
    “我和她这婚姻天配就，
    东捣西捣，没脱过我的手。
    “说来说去还是我说的那句话：
    太阳会从西边出来吗？”
    喝酒赌博寨门口没放哨，
    游击队悄悄过来了！
    枪声一响乱喊“杀！”
    咱们的游击队打来啦！
    一人一马一杆枪，
    咱们游击队势力壮！
    大刀、马枪、红缨枪，
    马枪、步枪、无烟钢。
    白军当兵的那个愿打仗？
    乖乖的都给游击队缴了枪。
    点起火把满寨子明，
    庄户人个个来欢迎。
    连排长没兵，酒席桌前干着急，
    崔二爷怕的钻到炕洞里。
    连长跑了抓排长，
    一个一个都捆上。
    崔二爷浑身软不踏踏，
    捆一个老头来看瓜。
    连长翻墙往外跳，
    冷不防被牛四娃抓定了。
    听见枪响香香笑，
    十成是咱游击队打来了。
    人逢喜事精神爽，
    翻起身来跳下炕。
    走起路来快又急，
    看看我亲人在那里？
    队长跟前请了假，
    王贵到上院来找她。
    满院子火把亮又明，
    不见我妹妹在那里盛？
    远远＠见一个新媳妇，
    上身穿红下身绿。
    马有记性不怕路途长，
    王贵的模样，香香不会忘。
    羊肚子手巾脖子里围，
    不是我哥哥是个谁？
    两人对面拉着手，
    难说难笑难开口。
    一肚子话儿说不出来，
    好比那，一条手巾把嘴塞。
    挣扎半天，王贵才说了一句话：
    “咱们闹革命，革命也是为了咱！”
    （完）
