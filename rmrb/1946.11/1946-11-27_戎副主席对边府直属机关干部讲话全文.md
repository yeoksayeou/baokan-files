The "National Assembly" monopolized and created by the Kuomintang single-handedly opened on the 15th. Since the opening, we have not heard of any "resolutions" being made. It's just that Chiang Kai-shek summons those lackey representatives to eat and drink every day. After eating and drinking, the "resolutions" will come out. Everyone can see that the Communist Party and the Democratic League have refused to attend this meeting that will stink for ten thousand years. This meeting is even more hated by the people than Duan Qirui's post-war conference. Chiang Kai-shek, on the one hand, claims to "implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference," and on the other hand, he arbitrarily convenes the "National Assembly"; on the one hand, he announces a "ceasefire," and on the other hand, he attacks Yan'an. Convening the "National Assembly" and attacking Yan'an completely exposed the dictatorial civil war drama played by Chiang Kai-shek. It is also his last desperate move to attack the Liberated Areas, tearing off his ferocious face. The "ceasefire order" before the "National Assembly" is a foreshadowing of further expansion of the civil war. Chiang's lackeys will inevitably follow suit and scold him. Xinhua News Agency has pointed out that convening the "National Assembly" and attacking Yan'an are the beginning of Chiang Kai-shek's military and political demise. In order to realize the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, achieve national democracy, defend Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, and defend Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, we must oppose these two evil dramas of Chiang to the end! Comrades! We must recognize Chiang Kai-shek's fate of failure and death. In the four and a half months of patriotic self-defense war, although we have lost more than 100 cities, Chiang Kai-shek has lost 47 brigades. It can be said that the second 25 brigades have been written off 15. Our area has wiped out 11 and a half brigades, but we are still not satisfied and will further strive to write off more.

After four and a half months of struggle, who won in the end? Some people still don't know and are skeptical. It can be affirmed that we won the first step. I suggest that everyone study "On the Situation" and the article "Visiting General Liu Bocheng" published in the People's Daily on the 20th in detail, and it will become clear. Why are you skeptical about today's revolutionary struggle situation? The reasons are: (1) Insufficient understanding of the long-term and complex nature of the Chinese revolution; (2) Lack of understanding of the strategic and tactical of the Chinese people's self-defense war. Giving up one city and one place and concentrating superior forces to eliminate Chiang Kai-shek's living forces is the summary of the Chinese people's revolutionary war for more than 20 years. We can let go and fight if we put down the burden of the cities, and the cities will still be ours in the end. The war is long-term and complex. Comrade Liu Shaoqi estimated that it would take two to four months to repel the enemy's offensive. Now Chiang Kai-shek does not have much troops to transfer to attack us. After we eliminate Chiang Kai-shek's main force to a considerable extent, we will turn to counter-offensive. However, after the counter-offensive, it does not mean that the war will end and the revolution will be successful. Chiang Kai-shek still has his godfather, the American imperialist, to help, but when we wipe out his 60-plus American-equipped divisions, the battle will be easier to fight. Don't worry, the big victory is yet to come!

In order to better support the war of self-defense, we have studied the appeals of Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Peng Dehuai, Comrade Liu Shaoqi and others. According to the current situation, the tasks of our Border Region Government are: (1) Serve the war, face the war, support the front, organize manpower and material resources, and ensure war supplies. The current war is the main form of struggle. Only by winning the war can we talk about other work. (2) Because we are fighting a full-scale war, not only the front is fighting, but the rear must also ensure the victory of the war, so we must step up the work of filling in the gaps and complete the "land to the tiller" movement, and immediately start preparing for next year's great production. The war is long-term and the consumption is huge. Long-term war requires long-term planning. "War is the final competition of manpower and material resources." Organization is leadership. We must have vision, scientific and precise plans, a resolute and efficient fighting style, and implement them to ensure that all work is actually fulfilled.

In order to adapt to the war, the organizational form must be changed quickly, reduce the administrative work of the organs, organize manpower, serve the front, and go down to check and help the movement of filling in the gaps. The Border Region Government currently has 93 cadres. Leaving 40-odd people can handle daily affairs, and the rest can go down. We must distinguish between urgency and importance, and we can simply put down unimportant work. Make the organs short, small, and efficient. The struggle is so tense and vivid, what's the use of us sitting in the organs? The directly subordinate bureaus of the Border Region Government must also change their respective organizational forms according to this spirit.

About life: Every victory is exchanged for at a precious price. We should pay close attention to saving manpower, material resources, and financial resources, and think more about the people. Waste is a crime!

In addition, we must immediately start engaging in vigorous production. Without production, we cannot guarantee war supplies. We must launch a region-wide great production movement. In counties, districts, and villages that have achieved "tilling three and having one surplus," we must also launch a movement for every family to increase production in agriculture and handicrafts, and every village to have a surplus next year.

We must carry forward the past hard-working and excellent style and prepare for hard struggle. Chairman Mao often used our region's success in overcoming the famine and eliminating locusts to mobilize everyone to overcome difficulties. Now we must strive for savings and supply the front. If we don't defeat the Chinese reactionaries, the people will have no happiness. Hardship has a noble purpose. We must resolutely struggle, overcome hedonism, obey discipline, obey orders, think more about the victory of the revolution, and make fewer unreasonable personal demands. Comrades, as long as we persevere in our struggle with one heart and one mind, the Chiang Kai-shek stone slab that is pressing on the Chinese people will surely be overturned and smashed!

　　戎副主席对边府直属机关干部讲话全文
    国民党一手包办、一党制造的“国民大会”，十五日下午已开幕。开幕以来，还没有听到做出什么“决议”。只是蒋介石每天召集那些奴才代表吃吃喝喝，吃完饭喝完酒以后，“决议”就会出来，大家看吧，共产党、民主同盟已拒绝出席这个遗臭万年的会，这个会比段祺瑞的善后会议更被人民仇视。蒋介石一面口称“实行政协决议”，一面又擅自召开“国大”；一面宣布“停战”，一面又进攻延安。召开“国大”与进攻延安，就把蒋介石所扮演的独裁内战戏，全部揭开了，也是他撕开凶恶脸皮孤注一掷进攻解放区最后一着。“国大”前之“停战令”，是进一步扩大内战的伏笔，蒋家奴才们，必然要跟着叫骂一番。新华社已经指出召开“国大”、进攻延安是蒋介石军事政治宣布死亡的开始。我们为实现政协决议，全国民主，保卫陕甘宁、保卫毛主席、朱总司令，对蒋这两个恶剧一定要反对到底！同志们！我们要认识蒋介石失败死亡的命运。四个半月爱国自卫战争，我们虽然失掉了一百多个城市，而蒋介石却断送了四十七个旅，可以说第二个二十五个旅已报销了十五个，我区消灭了十一个半旅，但我们还是不满足，要进一步争取多报销。
    四个半月斗争的结果，倒底谁打赢了呢？有些人还不知道，怀疑。可以肯定的说，第一步我们是打赢了。我介绍大家详细研究“论战局”和二十日人民日报载《访刘伯承将军》一文，就会清楚。对于今天的革命斗争形势为什么怀疑呢？原因是：（一）对中国革命的长期性复杂性认识不足；（二）对中国人民自卫战争之战略战术不懂。放弃一城一地集中优势兵力消灭蒋介石有生力量，这是中国人民革命战争二十多年的总结，我们把城市的包袱放下，就可以放开手打，最后城市还是我们的。战争是长期的复杂的，刘少奇同志估计两个月——四个月可以打退敌人攻势，现在蒋介石能够抽调进攻我们的兵力已不多，我们消灭蒋介石的主力到相当程度后，即将转到反攻。但反攻后，也不等于战争就要结束，革命就算成功，蒋介石还有他干爸爸美帝国主义者帮助，但我们把他的六十多个美械师消灭完了，仗就更容易打，大家不要着急，大的胜利还在后头！
    为着更好的支援自卫战争，我们研究了朱彭总副司令、刘少奇等同志的号召，根据当前形势，我们边府的工作任务：（一）服务于战争、面对战争、支援前线、组织人力物力，保证战争供给。当前战争是斗争的主要形式，只要争取到战争的胜利，才能谈其他工作。（二）由于我们是全力全面的战争，不仅前方打仗，后方还要保证战争的胜利，所以必须加紧进行填平补齐、完成耕者有其田运动，并要即刻着手准备明年大生产。战争是长期的，消耗是很大的，长期的战争需要长期打算。“战争是人力物力的总决赛”，组织就是领导，要有远见，有科学精确的计划，雷厉风行的战斗作风，贯彻执行，求一切工作在实际上兑现。
    为适应战争，组织形式必须迅速改变，缩小机关文牍事务工作，组织人力，服务前线与到下边检查帮助填平补齐运动，边府现有干部九十三人，留四十几个人即能处理日常事情，其他都可下去。要分开缓急轻重，不关重要的工作可以干脆放下，机关作到短小精干。斗争如此紧张生动，我们坐在机关有什么用处？边府直属局，亦要根据这种精神改变各自组织形式。
    关于生活：每次胜仗，都是用宝贵代价换来的，我们应十分注意节约人力物力财力，多多的为人民打算。浪费就是罪恶！
    另外，必须即刻着手从事大力生产，不生产不能保证战争供给，我们要开展一个全区性的大生产运动。已作到耕三余一的县区村庄，明年还要来一个农业手工业的家家增产，村村有余运动。
    我们要发扬过去艰苦优良作风，准备艰苦奋斗。毛主席常常拿我区渡过灾荒消灭蝗虫来动员大家克服困难，现在我们更须力求节约，供给前线，不打败中国反动派，人民没有幸福可言。艰苦是有高尚目的的，我们要坚决奋斗，克服享乐主义，服从纪律，服从命令，多为革命胜利设想，少做私人无理要求。同志们，只要我们一心一德坚持奋斗下去，压在中国人民头上这块蒋介石石板，是一定会翻起打碎的！
