　　On the War Situation
    *Liberation Daily* Editorial, November 4th
    October has passed, marking the fourth month since Chiang Kai-shek launched a full-scale civil war. To observe the war situation now, the following four important figures must be listed: First, in October, Chiang Kai-shek's invading troops had eight brigades annihilated. Adding the previous twenty-five brigades, the total comes to thirty-three brigades, accounting for one-sixth of Chiang Kai-shek's invading forces; Second, while the overall situation is still one of Chiang attacking and us defending, due to the Chiang army's insufficient forces, our army has launched counter-offensives in local areas. This is the case in the eastern Hebei region, where our army recovered three county seats in October, and Chiang's army, holding empty cities, is in a passive and vulnerable state; Third, since July, the Chiang army has occupied 117 county-level cities in the Liberated Areas. Currently, the Liberated Areas still have 378 county-level cities, and in the vast rural areas where county seats have been occupied, most remain in the hands of the military and civilians of the Liberated Areas; Fourth, according to various newspapers, peasant uprisings and civilian armed forces in the Chiang-controlled areas have reached 130,000.
    Based on the above figures to observe the future war situation, the major turning point of Chiang's army changing from a strategic offensive to a strategic defensive, and the Liberated Areas' military and civilians changing from a strategic defensive to a strategic counter-offensive, is not far away. The next few months will be the key to this major turning point. For the military and civilians of the Liberated Areas, the next few months are like climbing a mountain to the summit, the most critical part of the entire journey. For American imperialism and its running dog, Chiang Kai-shek, the difficulties due to the Chiang army's insufficient forces and low morale have become acute. These months will also be the most critical. What they will strive for is to desperately salvage their inevitably approaching future of failure.
    American imperialism and its running dog, the Kuomintang reactionaries, are determined to eliminate the Liberated Areas in order to eliminate China's democratic movement. To have any doubt about this is a mistake. Everyone already knows that without the help of American imperialism, Chiang Kai-shek would not dare to fight a civil war. How much has the United States helped Chiang Kai-shek? Since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the U.S. government has given Chiang Kai-shek weapons, materials, and loans amounting to $4 billion, exceeding the total amount of U.S. loans to Britain after the war, and exceeding the total amount of relief materials provided by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to the world in one year. If the purpose of American imperialism in giving such huge assistance to the fascist dictator Chiang Kai-shek was not to turn China into a colony in one war and to eliminate China's democratic forces in one blow, it would be very strange. As for Chiang Kai-shek's so-called five conditions and eight conditions, occupying Zhangjiakou, unilaterally convening the so-called "National Assembly," and promulgating conscription laws, none of them are not for the purpose of fighting the civil war to the end, which is even more obvious. Therefore, what is placed before China's 450 million compatriots is a critical moment of life and death. No matter how eloquent or feigning ignorance the American imperialists are, the facts have been revealed and cannot deceive anyone. The reason why an increasingly large number of people are rapidly awakening to the great disaster of the nation and rising up to save themselves and resist the joint conspiracy of the US and Chiang is precisely this.
    The conspiracy of the US and Chiang is extremely poisonous, and the ambitions of the US and Chiang are greater than those of any previous imperialist and any dictator; but they cannot overwhelm the great Chinese people. They are not only politically unjust, but also have fatal weaknesses in military affairs, namely, war-weariness among the soldiers and insufficient forces.
    In October, in order to remedy its insufficient forces, Chiang Kai-shek mainly adopted three methods: First, tactically more cautious and careful, daring not to disperse and advance rashly, often concentrating four or seven brigades together on a narrow front, advancing side by side, in order to avoid being annihilated by our army. However, this method still failed to achieve any effect. In October, our army was still able to annihilate as many as eight enemy brigades. On the contrary, this method created new difficulties for Chiang's army: after concentrating its forces in one place, other places became empty; Second, the already small number of troops stationed in the south were further transferred to reinforce the front lines, but this method also failed to solve the problem, because not only were there not many troops that could be transferred to no avail, but also after the transfer, the rear became empty, and peasant uprisings easily arose; Third, conscription was carried out. The quality of these newly conscripted soldiers was even weaker, and they could not provide immediate relief. It usually takes as long as a year for the Chiang army units that have been annihilated and suffered devastating blows to replenish new soldiers and restore their original combat effectiveness, and this kind of conscription has aroused strong opposition from all strata and promoted the outbreak of civil unrest. Under such circumstances, Chiang's army occupies more land, its forces are more dispersed, and the pitiful situation of being annihilated more and having insufficient forces cannot be salvaged.
    The Liberated Areas have lost some cities in the past four months, but the loss of these cities has not weakened our strength. On the contrary, by eliminating peaceful illusions, we have become stronger as we fight. The situation in the eastern Hebei Liberated Area is a clear example. The eastern Hebei Liberated Area originally had fifteen county seats. Immediately after the Anping Incident, on September 4, Chiang Kai-shek attacked with sixteen regular divisions (belonging to six armies) of the Eleventh War Zone and the Northeast Headquarters, the Transportation Police Headquarters, local teams, and puppet troops, totaling 130,000 people. By September 21, all the county seats had been occupied. During the enemy's attack, our army annihilated more than 1,300 enemies in the suburbs of Xianghe on September 5, and more than 400 enemies in Jixian County on the 13th. In addition to combat casualties, only ten of our soldiers were captured due to straggling, and only three guns were lost. After May 21, the Chiang army, due to insufficient forces, transferred troops from eastern Hebei to attack Zhangjiakou. Our army in eastern Hebei then launched a counter-offensive. On September 25, the 450th Regiment of the 151st Brigade of the 62nd Division was annihilated, including the regimental commander, deputy regimental commander, chief of staff, director, and more than 150 others. On October 4, more than 1,160 Chiang puppet troops were annihilated in northern Luan County, and 700 people were captured. In total, in the past two months, our army in eastern Hebei has fought 80 battles, annihilating 7,000 Chiang troops, with a casualty ratio of Chiang ten to our one, and recovered the three county seats of Qinglong, Leting, and Ninghe. The example of eastern Hebei shows that losing county seats cannot eliminate us, nor can it reduce our combat effectiveness. On the contrary, as long as we resolutely resist and handle it well, our army's combat effectiveness will be enhanced.
    Of course, when we lose places, it will cause some shock, and the retreat from large cities like Zhangjiakou will cause more shock. But this kind of shock is first, temporary, and will subside after a short period; second, it can be prevented. For example, in the Zibo area on the Jiaoji Line, there was a larger temporary shock because there was a peaceful mindset and no combat mobilization beforehand, and there was no preparation when the enemy came. However, in the Gaomi area, there was explanation and preparation beforehand, and this shock was almost non-existent; third, even if there are some losses in the shock, they can still be recovered. Facts have proven that as long as we eliminate the peaceful mindset and peaceful illusions, and establish the determination to fight hard with the enemy, then after the enemy occupies the city, the vast rural areas can still be persisted anywhere, because the people support us.
    The summary of the past four months is that Chiang's army is bound to be defeated and our army is bound to win. Four months of fighting have brought the war situation to such a point that as long as we continue our past efforts, annihilate a large number of enemy personnel and persist in guerrilla warfare in the areas occupied by the Chiang army, we may be able to change from a strategic defensive to a strategic counter-offensive in a short period of time. Four months of experience tell us that we must fundamentally eradicate all peaceful illusions about Chiang and the US, and fight with the spirit of mortal struggle. Without the spirit of mortal struggle, abandoning posts at will, being pessimistic and disappointed, and blaming each other are what the enemy hopes for. This situation can come from two sources: one is due to insufficient political experience, and the other is due to the ideological corruption of a small number of cadres. We must strive to overcome them separately, unite the whole party, the whole army, and the whole people, and fight to the death for the nation and the people. There is still a difficult road ahead of the situation, but it is precisely this environment that tests every one of our party members and every one of our soldiers, testing the revolutionary qualities of each of us. In this test, many heroes of the people and many people's leaders worthy of the people's pride will emerge, while a small number of wavering elements will be eliminated in the struggle.
    At least two conditions guarantee the victory of the Chinese people's independent, peaceful, and democratic movement. These two conditions are the inevitable arrival of world progress and the crisis of American imperialism. These two conditions make it impossible for American imperialists to seek a way out by launching a third world war, and make the reactionary policy of American imperialism helping Chiang's civil war and turning China into a colony inevitably fail sooner or later. That is to say, the prospect of the victory of the Chinese people's independent, peaceful, and democratic movement is undoubtedly certain.
    The question that everyone is concerned about now is that American imperialism has used treacherous and deceitful means to deceive the world and has given Chiang Kai-shek a large amount of assistance, enabling him to launch a full-scale civil war. In this ongoing civil war, can we Chinese people persist? Can we achieve victory? Based on the past four months, we can answer very affirmatively: we can completely persist and we can win. The reason for this is that the Chinese people already have their own army, have vast liberated areas, and have learned the art of mobile warfare and guerrilla warfare. We have been tempered by the Long March, and we have been tempered by the most difficult period of the Anti-Japanese War—1941 to 1942—so we have full confidence to meet the current difficult test. As long as we have the spirit of never surrendering to American imperialism and the fascist dictator Chiang Kai-shek, the spirit of desperately fighting and persisting in all posts, and the spirit of uniting as one and fighting the enemy, victory is assured. Our enemies are ideological corruption, fear of the enemy, fear of difficulties, peaceful illusions, retreat and escape, personal calculations and small groupism, lack of vigilance, and lack of discipline. We should resolutely fight against these enemies, unite as one, and strive hard. Pass the summit in front of us and strive for the arrival of the counter-offensive. The present and the next few months may be a few months of decisive significance in Chinese history.
    At the Seventh National Congress of the Party last year, Comrade Mao Zedong said in his political report: "Our party had no more than 50,000 members during the Northern Expedition, and most of them were later scattered by the enemy at that time; during the Land Revolution, we had no more than 300,000 members, and most of them were later scattered by the enemy at that time; now we have 1.2 million members, and this time we must not be scattered by the enemy no matter what." Now that American imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek want to scatter us, at such a decisive moment, we revisit these words of Chairman Mao. Let our two million party members rise up, rely on the people, and firmly believe that the creative power of the people is infinite, and therefore trust the people and become one with the people, then we will not only not be scattered by the enemy, but on the contrary, we will surely overwhelm the enemy. Let us work harder and unite more in the next few months, and the improvement of the war situation will come.

　　论战局
    解放日报四日社论
    十月份过去了，这是蒋介石发动全面内战后的第四个月。现在来观察战局，须列举下列四个重要的数字：第一、十月份蒋介石进犯军被歼八个旅，加上以前的二十五个旅，共有三十三个旅，占蒋介石进犯军六分之一；第二、在整个形势还是蒋攻我守的时候，由于蒋军兵力不足，已经出现了我军在局部地区的反攻，这就是冀东地区。该区我军十月份收复县城三处，蒋军坐守空城陷于被动挨打的状况；第三、解放区自七月以来，被蒋军侵占县市一百十七个，现在解放区尚有县市三百七十八个，而在县城被占的地方广大的乡村，大部仍在解放区军民手中；第四、蒋管区农民起义的民变武装，据各报所载已达十三万人。
    根据上述数字来观察今后战局，蒋军由战略攻势转为战略守势、解放区军民由战略守势转为战略反攻的重大转变时机，已经不远了。今后几个月，将是这个重大转变的关键。对于解放区军民，今后几个月，犹如爬山到了过山顶的时候，这是全程中最紧张的一段。对于美国帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石，由于蒋军兵力不足与士气低落的困难，已经尖锐起来。这几个月也将是最紧张的一段。他们所要努力的是竭力挽救其必将到来而不可避免的失败前途。
    美国帝国主义及其走狗国民党反动派，下定了决心要消灭解放区，以便消灭中国的民主运动。对于这一点，如果还有丝毫怀疑，都是错误的。大家已经知道，没有美国帝国主义的帮助，蒋介石是不敢打内战的。美国帮助蒋介石多少呢？抗战胜利以后，美国政府给予蒋介石的武器物资和借款已达四十万万美金，这超过美国战后对英借款的总额，超过联合国救济总署一年中对全世界救济物资的总额。美国帝国主义给予法西斯独裁者蒋介石以如此巨大的援助，其目的如果不是想在一次战争中就把中国变为殖民地，在一个打击之下就把中国民主力量消灭干净，那就奇怪得很了。至于蒋介石的什么五项条件八项条件，占领张家口，擅自召开所谓“国民大会”，颁布征兵法令等，没有一件不是为了把内战打到底，这更是显而易见。因此，放在中国四万万五千万同胞面前的，乃是生死存亡的关头，尽管美帝国主义者如何花言巧语，或者假痴假呆，事实已经揭露，是骗不了任何人的。日益广大的人们迅速的觉悟到民族的大灾难而奋起自救，奋起反抗美蒋联合的阴谋，其原因即在于此。
    美蒋的阴谋是毒极了的，美蒋的野心是比以往任何帝国主义者与任何独裁者来得更大；但是他们是压不倒伟大的中国人民的。他们不仅在政治上是非正义的，而且在军事上也有致命的弱点，这就是军心厌战与兵力不足。
    十月份中，蒋介石为了补救其兵力不足，主要的采取了三种方法：一是战术上更加谨慎小心，不敢分散冒进，往往在狭小正面集中四个或七个旅在一起齐头并进，以冀免被我军消灭。然而这个方法仍未能有什么效用，十月份我军仍能歼敌八个旅之多。相反的这个办法，使蒋军又产生了新的困难：就是在如此集中兵力于一处之后，其他地方又空虚起来；二是把已经很少的驻在南方的军队，再行抽调增强前线，可是这个办法，也解决不了问题，因为不但所能抽调的已经无多无济于事，而且抽调之后，后方空虚，农民起义就容易起来；三是进行抓兵，这种新抓来的兵素质更弱，时间上缓不济急，被歼灭的和遭受歼灭性打击的蒋军部队补充新兵，通常经过一年之久还不能恢复原有的战斗力，而且这种抓兵，引起各阶层的强烈反对，促成民变的爆发，在这种情形之下，蒋军占地愈多兵力愈分散，被歼愈多兵力愈不足的可悲状况，仍是无法挽救。
    解放区方面这四个月来失去了一些城市，但是这些城市的失去没有使我们的力量削弱，相反的，由于去掉了和平幻想，我们却是愈战愈强。冀东解放区的情形就是一个明显的证据。冀东解放区原有十五个县城，紧接着安平事件之后，九月四日起，蒋介石以十一战区和东北行营所属的十六个正规师（属六个军）交通警察总队地方团队及伪军共十三万人进攻。至九月二十一日，就全部占领所有的县城。在敌人进攻的过程中，我军曾于九月五日在香河城郊歼敌一千三百余，十三日蓟县境内歼敌四百余，除战斗伤亡外，我军因掉队被俘者仅十人，失枪仅三支。五月二十一日以后，蒋军因兵力不足，由冀东抽兵进攻张家口。冀东我军即转入反攻。九月廿五日，歼敌整六二师一五一旅四五○团团长副团长参谋长主任以下一百五十余。十月四日，歼蒋伪军一千一百六十余于滦县北部，俘七百人。总计两个月来，冀东我军作战八十次，歼蒋军七千，伤亡比例为蒋十我一，并收复青龙乐亭宁河三个县城。冀东的例子说明了失去县城不能使我们消灭，也不能减低我们的战斗力，相反的，只要坚决抵抗和处理得好，我军的战斗力会增强起来。
    当然在我们失去地方的时候会引起若干震动，而大城市如像张家口的撤退，会引起多一些的震动。但这种震动一是暂时的，过了一个短时期之后，就平息了；二是可以豫防的，例如胶济线上淄博地区，曾因事前有太平观念没有战斗动员，敌人来时没有准备，暂时的震动就较大，但是高密地区，事前有了解释有了准备，这种震动就几乎没有；三是即使在震动中有些损失，还是可以恢复的。事实证明，只要消除了太平观念与和平幻想，立下了同敌人坚持苦斗的决心，那末在敌人占领城市后，广大的乡村仍是任何地方都可以坚持，因为人民是拥护我们的。
    四个月来的总结，就是蒋军必败我军必胜。四个月的战斗，已使战局达到这样一个境地，即是只要继续过去的努力，大量歼灭敌人有生力量和在蒋军占领地区坚持游击战争，我们就可能在短期内由战略守势转到战略反攻。四个月的经验告诉我们，必须根本铲除对于蒋美的一切和平幻想，以决死斗争的精神来奋斗。没有决死斗争的精神，随便放弃岗位，悲观失望、互相埋怨，这是敌人所希望的。这种情况可以来自两种来源：一种是由于政治经验不足，另一种是由于少数干部思想上的腐化，必须努力分别加以克服，全党全军全民一致团结，为民族为人民而拚死斗争。时局还有一段艰苦的途程，但是正是这种环境，才是对于我们每一个党员每一个战士的考验，考验我们每个人的革命品质。这种考验之中，将涌现出许多人民的英雄，许多值得人民引为骄傲的人民领袖，而少数动摇分子，则将在斗争中被淘汰。
    至少有两个条件使中国人民的独立和平民主运动有胜利的保证。这两个条件，就是世界进步与美国帝国主义的危机必然到临。这两个条件，使美国帝国主义者没有可能以发动第三次世界大战来寻求出路，而且使美国帝国主义助蒋内战化中国为殖民地的反动政策迟早必然失败。这就是说，中国人民独立和平民主运动的胜利的远景，是确定无疑的了。
    现在大家所关心的问题，是美国帝国主义已经用背信弃义欺骗世界的阴险手段，给了蒋介石以大量援助，使之能够发动全面内战。在这目前存在着的内战中，我们中国人民能够坚持下去么？能够取得胜利么？根据四个月的经过，我们十分肯定的回答道：完全可以坚持并且可以胜利。所以如此，因为中国人民已经有了自己的军队，有了广大的解放区，而且学会了运动战与游击战争。我们有过万里长征的锻炼，有过抗日战争中最艰难的时期——一九四一至四二年——的锻炼，因而我们有了充分的信心，来迎接现在又一艰苦的考验。只要我们有对美国帝国主义与法西斯独裁者蒋介石宁死不投降的精神，有舍命苦斗坚持一切岗位的精神，有团结一致与敌斗争的精神，胜利就有把握。我们的敌人乃是思想上的腐化惧怕敌人，惧怕困难，和平幻想，退却逃跑，个人打算与小团体主义，没有警惕性，不守纪律等等。应该与这些敌人坚决奋斗，团结一致，努力奋斗。经过当面的山顶，争取反攻的到来。现在与今后的几个月，可能是中国历史上有决定意义的几个月了。
    在去年党的七次大会上，毛泽东同志在其政治报告中说：“我们的党，在北伐战争时期不超过五万党员，并且后来大部分被当时的敌人打散了；在土地革命时期不超过三十万党员，后来大部分也被当时的敌人打散了；现在我们有了一百二十万党员，这一回无论如何不要被敌人打散。”现在美国帝国主义与蒋介石要想打散我们，在这样的决定关头，我们重温毛主席的这些话，让我们二百万党员全体奋起，依靠人民，坚决地相信人民的创造力量是无限的，因而信任人民和人民打成一片，那末我们不但不会被敌人打散，相反的，我们一定压倒敌人，让我们在今后几个月中更加努力，更加团结，战局的好转就会到来了。
