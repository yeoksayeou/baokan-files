    Heroine Wang Hehua of Gaoling
    Made a Fortune in Three Years of Weaving
    [Our Newspaper's News] Wang Hehua, a weaving hero from Gaoling Village, Fourth District, Wuxiang, made a fortune in three years of weaving. Wang Hehua's family has three people and used to have only three mu of land, and they did not live a good life. Later, she listened to the government's words and started weaving in 1944. In the past three years, in addition to taking care of housework and farm work, she has earned a total of seven shi and two dou of rice (large shi). She successively bought five mu of land, pawned seven mu of land, bought four sheep, and partnered with three families to buy a large cow. This year, the village also allocated three mu of land to her. Now Wang Hehua has eighteen mu of land, and the calf born by the cow belongs to her. She has truly become a wealthy family that "has land and livestock, and does not have to worry about food and clothing." At this Wuxiang County Labor Hero Conference, Wang Hehua was again selected to attend as a hero. She smiled so that her eyebrows stretched into a line and said to people: "I have both benefits and fame, and the Eighth Route Army helped me turn over." She also helped other women learn to weave. She said: "The Eighth Route Army helped me make a fortune, and I also have to help others make a fortune." This year, she lent cotton to Zhao Ailan and others to form a weaving group of ten people, earning a total of 114 jin of cotton in more than half a year.

    高岭女英雄王荷花
    纺织三年发了家
    【本报讯】武乡四区高岭村纺织英雄王荷花纺织三年发了家。王荷花家里三口人，过去只三亩地，过不上好光景。后来，她听信政府的话，从四四年起，开始了纺织。三年来，她除料理家务并干地活外，共赚米七石二斗（大石）。先后买地五亩，典地七亩，买羊四只，三家合伙买了一头大母牛。今年村里又分给她三亩地。现在王荷花有地十八亩，母牛生了一牛犊归她。真成为“有地有牲口，穿吃不用愁”的富裕之家了。此次武乡全县的劳英大会，王荷花又被选为出席英雄。她笑得眉毛拉成一条线地对人说：“我有利又有名，八路军帮我翻了身。”她还帮助别的妇女学习纺织。她说：“八路军帮我发了财，我也得帮助别人发财。”她今年借花给赵爱兰等成立了十个人的纺织小组，大半年共赚花一百一十四斤。
