　　Two Major Japanese Labor Unions Join Forces
    Demand to Overthrow the Yoshida Government Formally Submitted to Cabinet Meeting
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st] Tokyo Dispatch: After days of consultation, Japan's two major labor union organizations—the Federation of Industrial Organizations and the Labor Union Federation—have decided to join forces in the movement against the Yoshida Cabinet and formally submitted their demand to overthrow the Yoshida government to the Cabinet meeting on the night of the 18th. Tokyo observers attach great importance to the first collaboration of these two major labor unions (with a total of 2.5 million members) led by the Japanese Communist Party and the Socialist Party. The Tokyo Shimbun reported that, simultaneously with the movement against Yoshida, plans are actively underway to unite the national labor front (including middle-level trade unions) to establish unified leadership.
