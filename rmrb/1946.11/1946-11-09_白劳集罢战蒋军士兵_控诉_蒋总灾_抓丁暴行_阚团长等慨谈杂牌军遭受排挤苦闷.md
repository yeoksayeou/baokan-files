[This newspaper's Wei County dispatch, 1st] Soldiers of the Bai Lao Ji in the Chiang army went on strike and accused the Chiang army of its crimes, calling on the brothers under the Chiang army's rule to rise up against the war and strike. Bai Xiaohan, whose mother is old and father is dead, recounted the painful experience of being conscripted: He is from Dayi County, Sichuan. He made a meager living doing small business at home. In August of the twentieth year, he was caught by the Bao head to join the 16th Engineer Regiment as a soldier. His mother was already seventy-two years old, and no one cared for her. If it weren't for "General Disaster Chiang" dragging him into conscription, the family wouldn't have been so scattered and miserable. You Congyun, the former lieutenant platoon leader of the mortar company of the 41st Nationalist Division said: "I was caught in Mianzhu, Sichuan, in September of the twenty-eighth year. In our new recruit company, we were all tied together with a big rope through our sleeves. When eating or going to the toilet, one had to come back before another could go out. Even so, there were still those who ran away every night. One night, six who were caught were all shot. I was already over thirty years old at that time, and my brain wasn't flexible, so I couldn't manage the 'at ease' and 'attention' commands. They told me to stick out my chest and punched me several times. My ribs still hurt to this day. The second time, they beat me until I sat on the ground. The third time, they used a bayonet to strike my palm, which swelled up so high that I couldn't even hold a bowl to eat. After hitting me, they even asked me if they were wrong to hit me. I was extremely resentful in my heart, but I had to say 'no'. I could only keep the hatred in my heart. This time, our artillery company had four cannons, and I was asked to bring over three, along with more than seventy brothers. If Chiang Kai-shek wants to continue fighting the civil war, he'll bring over even more. " Li Zhanyun said: "I am from Chongqing County, Sichuan. I was caught in Hankou as a substitute soldier at the age of fourteen. In the thirty-third year, I asked for leave to retire, but I had no travel expenses to go home. After the Japanese surrendered, I asked for leave to retire again, but I didn't receive travel expenses. I had no choice but to sell cigarettes at the Zhengzhou Railway Station, preparing to save some money to go home. Who knew I would be caught by the 125th Brigade again? They didn't even let me pack up my cigarette stall before taking me to Kaocheng to fight the civil war. I've been in the army for ten years, and I've seen that none of the central army's officers, big or small, don't embezzle military pay. If a soldier is careless, his legs will be broken and he won't be able to walk to beg for food. Being a central army soldier is simply not something a human being can do. When I met your Eighth Route Army, it was different. Everyone was very polite to me, like a close brother. I also saw that officers and soldiers were equal, and finances were public. They even asked me to be a squad leader. I've been in the military for half my life, and I've never seen such a good army. I know that if I go back, I'll be caught by the central army again as cannon fodder. That's why I'm willing to work in the Eighth Route Army and defeat the reactionaries before going home."

[This newspaper's front-line reporters' group, 3rd] Kan Xiaozhen, the regiment commander of the 355th Regiment of the 119th Brigade, regiment vice Yang Yuncan, the first battalion commander Zhao Ziming, and others, who had just laid down their weapons at Liujiazhuang, the battle was not yet over, and our unit immediately sent people to buy meat, chicken, eggs, etc. to entertain them on the battlefield. Regiment Commander Kan expressed his sincere gratitude to me for my friendship and said: "The miscellaneous army officers have suffered all kinds of discrimination from the direct line. They only seek to scrape together a living and are uninterested in anything. Look at the newspapers, you can't see a single one that tells the truth. All you can see are the Kuomintang's propaganda organs full of lies, and the lies are extremely reactionary. Taking the news about General Liu Bocheng as an example: first they said he was killed, then they said he was seriously injured, then they said he was missing, and finally they said that the 'most reliable' thing was that he was killed by the militia. They can't even make their own stories match, and the readers can only take it for what it is. This time General Liu wiped out all three of our regiments, I wonder how they will lie about this?!" Regiment Commander Kan joined General Feng Yuxiang's National Army First Army in the 14th year of the Republic of China. When he heard the Yan'an broadcast and learned that General Kong Congzhou had restored the 38th Army, he was very excited. He regretted and said: "It is a pity that we do not have a visionary and capable leader, resulting in unnecessary sacrifices."

　　白劳集罢战蒋军士兵
    控诉“蒋总灾”抓丁暴行
    阚团长等慨谈杂牌军遭受排挤苦闷
    【本报威县一日电】白劳集罢战蒋军士兵，控诉蒋军罪恶，号召蒋军统治下的弟兄们起来反战罢战。母老父死的白晓韩诉说他被抓的痛苦经过：他是四川大邑县人。在家做小生意，难以糊口。二十年八月间，被保长抓到工兵十六团当兵，母亲已七十二岁，无人照管。要不是“蒋总灾”拉他的壮丁，一家人也不致弄得这样零散凄惨。游从云，原国民党四十一师迫击炮连少尉排长。他说：“我二十八年九月在四川绵竹被抓。我们新兵连，都用一条大绳从袖管里穿起来，吃饭解手一个回来，一个才叫出去。就这样每夜间也还有跑的。一天夜里，抓回来六个都枪毙了。我那时已三十多岁，脑筋不灵活，稍息立正弄不来。叫我把胸口挺起，顶了好几拳。到现在肋骨还痛。第二次，把我打的坐到地上。第三次用刺刀打手心，肿的多高，吃饭都不能端碗。打了我，还问我打你亏不亏，我心中恼恨已极，还得说“不亏”，只有把恨存在心里头。这次，我们炮兵连有四门炮叫我带过来三门，还带过来七十多个弟兄。蒋介石要继续打内战，带过来的还要多。李占云说：“我是四川重庆县的，十四岁在汉口被抓顶了新兵。三十三年，请假退伍，没路费不能回家。日本投降后，我又请假退伍，没发路费。我只得到郑州车站上卖纸烟，准备积几个钱好回家，谁知又被一二五旅抓住了。烟摊也不叫收拾，就带到考城来打内战。我混了十来年的队伍，看到的中央军，大小官没有一个不克扣军饷的。当兵的一不小心两腿打烂，要饭也走不动。中央兵简直不是人干的。我碰见咱八路军就不同，大家对我很客气，像亲兄弟一样，又看到官兵平等，经济公开，还叫我当班长。我混了半辈子行伍，没见过这样好队伍。我知道再回去还得叫中央军抓住当炮灰。所以我情愿在八路军作事，把反动派打败再回家。
    【本报前线记者团三日电】一一九旅三五五团团长阚校真，团副杨云灿，一营营长赵自明等，甫自刘家庄放下武器，战斗尚未结束，我某部立即派员在战地设法买肉、鸡、鸡蛋等招待。阚团长对我真诚友谊深表感谢，并谓：“杂牌军军官，受尽嫡系的排挤，只求混住饭碗，对任何事物，都意兴索然。看看报吧，一张说真话的都看不到，能看到的，都是满篇撒谎的蒋介石的机关报。而且是反动之至的撒谎。单以对刘伯承将军的消息为例：先说是打死，后说是重伤，后又说失踪，最后说：“最切实”的是被民兵打死。自己也不能自圆其说，读的人也只好心照不宜。这次刘将军把我们三个团全部都消灭了，不知道他们又该怎样撒这个谎呢？！”阚团长民国十四年，即参加冯玉祥将军领导之国民军第一军，当他收听到延安广播，得知孔从周将军恢复三十八军的消息时，非常兴奋。他遗憾地说：“可惜我们没有一个有远见有能力的人领导，以至作了无谓的牺牲。”
