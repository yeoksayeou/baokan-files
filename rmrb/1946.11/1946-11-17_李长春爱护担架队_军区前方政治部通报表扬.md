    Li Changchun Showed Care for the Stretcher Team
    Frontline Political Department of the Military Region Issued a Commendation
    [This newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 14th] The Frontline Political Department of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region recently issued a circular, calling on all units to learn from the excellent work style of Comrade Li, a cadre from a certain unit, in taking care of the stretchers. It is reported that according to reports from various counties in the Second Sub-district of Ji-Lu-Yu, everyone unanimously felt that "He Zheng" led the stretchers best during the three battles. This was reflected in the fact that although the fighting was so fierce, not a single stretcher bearer was injured or killed. The Juancheng stretcher team was most satisfied with Comrade Li Changchun, a cadre from a certain unit. They said: This Comrade Li took good care of the stretchers in terms of food and accommodation, constantly conveyed some victory news from the front, answered the stretchers' questions, and told them to be careful from air raids. After the Juancheng stretcher team returned, they all asked the district to write a letter to Comrade Li, expressing their unforgettable gratitude to Comrade Li. The Frontline Political Department therefore specially notified all units, hoping that everyone will learn from the excellent work spirit of Comrade Li in taking care of the stretchers.
