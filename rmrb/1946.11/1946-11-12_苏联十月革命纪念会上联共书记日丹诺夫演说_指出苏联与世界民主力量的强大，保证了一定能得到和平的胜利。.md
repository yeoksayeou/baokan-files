Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 9th: Moscow Radio: CPSU Central Committee Secretary Zhdanov delivered a speech on November 6th at a joint meeting of the Moscow Soviet and the CPSU Central Committee Political Bureau commemorating the 29th anniversary of the October Revolution. Zhdanov first pointed out: "The Soviet Union has become more consolidated and powerful. The difference between the Soviet Union and capitalist countries is that the Soviet Union has no crises, and all industries have turned to peaceful labor. After the Second World War, the Soviet Union suffered unparalleled losses, while many capitalist countries were not occupied by the enemy and did not need to carry out post-war reconstruction. However, these countries experienced production shrinkage, low production levels, and increased unemployment when transitioning from wartime to peacetime. For example, in the United States, the total industrial production in 1946 decreased by one-third compared to 1943, and the official number of unemployed workers reached three million. However, our people do not know what unemployment is. In the Soviet Union, the transition from war to peace production not only did not shrink but greatly expanded. A large number of soldiers returned to the production sector, and the Soviet Union did not close a single factory. Every Soviet citizen regards the completion and implementation of the new Five-Year Plan as their fighting program." Zhdanov then pointed out that the total output of products in the first four months of 1946 increased by 19% compared to the same period last year, and railway transportation increased by 12%. When describing Soviet foreign policy, Zhdanov said: "Just as the Soviet Union was the fighting vanguard against fascism during the war, at present, the Soviet Union is also the vanguard of all nations striving for peace." He pointed out that in international affairs, the Soviet Union's policy is to fight for a solid and lasting peace for all nations, and to consolidate the friendly cooperation of all peace-loving nations with all its strength. "It is precisely for this peace that Soviet representatives have done a lot of very complex work and efforts at the successive foreign ministers' meetings and the Paris Peace Conference. However, this effort has met with systematic resistance from certain countries, primarily the reactionary forces of the United States and Britain." Zhdanov then pointed out that there is a struggle between two tendencies in the post-war world, namely the progressive policy led by the Soviet Union that calls for international cooperation, preventing aggression, and consolidating peace, and the policy of the imperialist reactionaries attempting to establish world hegemony. Zhdanov forcefully stated: "Regardless of the resistance of the reactionaries, the cause of long-term and solid peace will ultimately be realized." He pointed out that the basis for the realization of victory is that the forces striving for peace are increasing day by day and are becoming more organized and more powerful. First of all, after defeating Germany and Japan, a new political situation was created around the world, awakening the broad masses of people and raising their political awareness. Under this powerful impetus, the democratic movements in many countries have developed, the democratic forces have strengthened, and the reactionary forces have weakened. The development of democratic forces in countries such as Southern Europe, Czechoslovakia, and Poland, and the rise of democratic movements in the former German satellite states of Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland, all prove this point. The recent major victory of the Bulgarian Fatherland Front once again demonstrates the consolidation of democratic forces in post-war Europe. Secondly, it should not be forgotten that the British Conservative Party was defeated, and the left-wing party alliance in France also won, which indicates a major step towards the left in these countries. Finally, everyone knows that the ideas of freedom and democratic development are equally popular among the people of colonial and dependent countries, who are all fighting for democratic freedom. Millions of workers have been organized to protect the cause of

    苏联十月革命纪念会上联共书记日丹诺夫演说
    指出苏联与世界民主力量的强大，保证了一定能得到和平的胜利。
    【新华社延安九日电】莫斯科广播：联共中央书记日丹诺夫，于十一月六日在莫斯科苏维埃及联共党中央政治局联合举行的纪念十月革命二十九周年纪念会上，发表演说。日丹诺夫首先指出：“苏联已更加巩固与强大了，苏联与资本主义国家的区别是在于苏联没有任何危机，全部工业已转入和平劳动。第二次大战后，苏联曾受到无可比拟的损失，而许多资本主义国家并未受到敌人侵占，无需进行战后恢复工作，可是这些国家在由战时转变到和平时却引起了生产缩小、生产水平低落及失业的增涨。例如美国一九四六年工业生产总量较一九四三年缩小三分之一，失业工人据官方说已达三百万人，而我国人不知失业为何物。在苏联，由战争转变到和平生产，不仅未缩小而且大为扩展。大批军人回到生产部门中去，苏联没有关闭过一个工厂。每一苏联儿女公民都把完成与实行新五年计划当作自己的战斗纲领。”日丹诺夫继指出一九四六年头四个月的生产品总量即较去年同一时期增涨百分之十九，铁道运输量增涨百分之十二。日丹诺夫叙述苏联外交政策时说道：“正如在战时苏联是反法西斯的战斗先锋，在现时，苏联同样是各族人民争取和平的先锋。”他指出在国际事业中，苏联的政策是为各族人民坚固的长期的和平而斗争的政策，用一切力量巩固爱好和平各族人民的友好合作。“正是为了这一和平，苏联代表在历次外长会议上，巴黎和会上，都已作了很多很复杂的工作与努力。可是这一努力遇到某些国家首先是美英反动势力的有系统的反抗。”日丹诺夫继而指出在战后世界中存在着两种倾向的斗争，即以苏联为首的要求国际合作，制止侵略，巩固和平的进步政策，与帝国主义反动派的企图建立世界霸权的政策之间的斗争。日丹诺夫力称：“不管反动派的反抗，长期坚固的和平事业归根到底会胜利实现的。”他指出胜利实现的根据称：为和平努力的力量正在日益增强，并正在变成更有组织与更加强大。首先在战胜德日之后，在全世界上造成新的政治局势，唤醒了广大民众，提高了他们的政治觉悟，在这一强大推动力之下，许多国家民主运动发展了，民主力量增强了，而反动的力量则减弱了。南、捷、波等国民主势力的发展，前德附庸国意、罗、保、匈、芬等国内民主运动的高涨，均证明这点。而最近保加利亚祖国阵线的重大胜利，再次表示战后欧洲民主力量的巩固。其次不应当忘记，英国保守党是失败了，法国的左翼政党联盟也获得了胜利，这都表示这些国家向左发展的重大步骤。最后大家知道，自由与民主发展的意想同样普及殖民地与附属国人民，他们都在为民主自由而奋斗，成百万的劳动者已组织了起来，在所有一切国家中，保护和平事业。这就是具有工人国际合作的支柱——世界职工联盟、国际妇女民主同盟、全世界民主青年同盟的努力。此外各民主国家之间文化联系正在发展与巩固。这一切就是和平事业胜利的保障。
