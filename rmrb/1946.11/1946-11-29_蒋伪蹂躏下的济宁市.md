The Jining City Under the Trampling of Chiang Kai-shek's Clique
    Weiguang

Under the cover of American-made Chiang Kai-shek planes, the puppet army of Wu Huawen, entrenched in Yanzhou, using American-made ammunition airlifted by Chiang Kai-shek, invaded Jining City on September 15th. Since then, 140,000 peaceful residents of Jining City have been thrown into the fire pit again.

The first major task for the traitor Wu Huawen after entering the city was to forcibly seize civilian laborers to repair fortifications, dig trenches, level graves, and block city gates. It has been more than a month, but it is still not finished. After repairing inside the city, he repairs outside the city. Where is the end?

The democratic government had helped the masses rebuild houses that had been torn down by the traitor Liu Bengong, but now the traitor Wu Huawen is forcing them to tear down these houses again. In order to "hinder the Eighth Route Army from entering the pass," he released water from the Grand Canal at Juyuan Bridge, causing the lower streets in the city, such as Huangjingge and Shuikouzi Street, to become a vast expanse of water. The entrances to the city were also blocked or submerged, making it impossible to pass through, and even the wheat fields near the city could not be sown.

Wu Huawen also brought hundreds of "Returning Home Corps," "Youth Corps," and secret service teams. They were active in the streets all day long – ransacking homes, sealing doors, extorting money, and arresting people. The special agent Hu Dianquan ransacked twenty or thirty homes in Huoshen Temple Street in one go. They walked around the streets with their thumbs up, shouting: "It's time for the bums to turn over!" "It's time for the bad guys to turn over!" When they saw citizens who were good people or members of the association, they sarcastically said: "Let's have a meeting!" "Let's sing!" The members dared not say anything to their faces, but they were extremely angry in their hearts, thinking, "You won't be around for long." Indeed, our armed work team raided the city on the 21st, captured some special agents, and distributed leaflets on the policy towards special agents. From then on, the Chiang agents disappeared, but their secret sabotage in the streets became even worse, making the citizens unaware of when they would get into trouble. The "Returning Home Corps" was even more ruthless. More than a dozen people were arrested in Xiaoguozhuang in the southwest of the city and beaten all over their bodies. Special agents in Liuhang Street even threw a child into the river.

When Wu Huawen first entered the city, he posted notices, convened meetings of town and street chiefs and bao chiefs, and sang loudly about "leniency policies," saying that "the struggle between the two armies is only for the people. It is understandable that the people join the Eighth Route Army and the association. Now, as long as they come back, nothing will happen. No arrests, no ransacking of homes, no retaliation..." But in fact, at the same time, there were mass arrests and killings. Two thousand people were arrested in the city in one go, and more than four thousand people were arrested outside the city in one go. Those who joined the association should be arrested, the families of those who resisted should be arrested, businessmen from other places should be arrested, and those with suspicious behavior should be arrested... The families of those who contributed to the war of resistance, street cadres who led the masses, and teachers in the education sector were all given the hats of "bandits" and "puppets." After being arrested, they were all locked up in Shuangjing Street and tied up. At this time, they were still singing his "leniency policy" and "guaranteeing release," but on October 18th, nineteen people were shot dead at the Jinde Association in one go, and sixteen more were killed on the third day. It is not known how many more were put into sacks and thrown into the Grand Canal.

Young and middle-aged people were forced to become soldiers, and a baojia system of joint responsibility was implemented. After registering their household registrations, the "Good Citizen Certificates" of the Japanese puppet era were stamped with the seal of the Chiang Kai-shek government. Everyone must have one, but this kind of "Good Citizen Certificate" is only given to those so-called "good citizens," while those so-called "bandits" and "puppets" are not given one. When "good citizens" go out, they have to show their certificates at the city gate for inspection and sign in the leave book. They are only allowed to go out for three hours. If they exceed the time, they will be charged with "colluding with bandits." Every day, they are only allowed to go out from 9:00 am to 3:00 pm. Therefore, citizens cannot buy roasted goods, and businesses cannot be done. Each bao is also assigned a specially trained agent to serve as the deputy of the bao team. All matters of guests, going out, celebrations, and funerals in this bao must be reported to the deputy of the bao team, which is the same as the method of the Yuan Dynasty Tartars, giving each security team a supreme emperor. This is Chiang Kai-shek's police rule.

Jining City, which was democratically prosperous under the leadership of the past democratic government, has now become a dead city. Businesses have closed down due to excessive taxes. Even those that have not closed are just coping. Large businesses have completely gone bankrupt. Yutang Sauce Garden alone has to send 130 catties of steamed buns and five loads of soup to the "Returning Home Corps" every day, not counting the large expenses for construction and welcome fees. It also has to send four workers to run errands for them every day. All kinds of levies on the streets are distributed according to household, regardless of rich or poor. A vendor selling sheep's blood in Liuhang Street, whose family of three depends on him for food, can no longer do his business, and has been levied 30 catties of grain and 500 yuan for construction fees, welcome fees, and baojia registration fees. He couldn't survive, so he escaped and said, "In this month, six out of ten families in the city have no food to eat."

The citizens of Jining are sighing: "The devils didn't ruin us in eight years, but Old Chiang ruined us in this one month." The citizens hope day and night that the Eighth Route Army will hurry over. At the same time, they are actively thinking of ways and looking for opportunities to take revenge. Now, the area near the city has become a world of armed work teams and guerrilla teams organized by the citizens.

　　蒋伪蹂躏下的济宁市
    微光
    在美制蒋机的掩护下，困守兖州的伪军吴化文部，使用着蒋介石空运给他的美造弹药，于九月十五日侵占了济宁市，从此，济宁市十四万和平居民，又被送入火坑了。
    吴逆化文进城后的第一件大事，就是强抓民夫修工事、挖战沟、平坟、堵城门，至今已修了一个多月了，可是还没有完。修了城内，还修城外，那有个头呢？
    民主政府曾帮助群众把被汉奸刘本功拆掉的房屋盖起来，现在吴逆化文又强迫把这些房子拆掉。为了“阻碍八路军入关”，竟在局阳桥放出运河的水来，使得城关较低的街道黄金阁、水口子街等处都成了一片汪洋。入城路口也都堵死或淹没，无法通行，连城附近的麦地也无法下种了。
    吴逆还带来了几百人的“还乡团”、“青年团”、特务队，他们整天在各街活动——抄家、封门、敲诈、勒索、抓人。特务胡殿全在火神庙街一次就抄了二三十家。他们在街上大拇指伸出来摇幌着喊：“该二流子翻身了！”“该坏蛋翻身了！”见了市民，好人，会员便讽刺的说：“开会罢！”“唱歌罢！”会员们当面不敢说啥，心里都气得了不得，心里想着“你们反正长不了。”果实，我们的武工队于二十一日袭入城关，捉了些特务，并散发了对特务政策的传单。从此，蒋特们隐声匿迹了，但他们在各街的暗地破坏却更厉害了，使得市民谁也不知啥时候就要摊事。“还乡团”的手段更毒辣，城西南小郭庄一下就被抓去了十几个，打得遍体鳞伤；柳行街特务竟把一个小孩子投到河里。
    吴逆刚入城时，也曾大贴布告，召开镇街保长会议，大唱“宽大政策”，说什么“两军之争不过是为民众，民众参加八路军，参加会，也是没办法，现在只要回来便没事，不抓人，不抄家，不报复……”。但事实上，同时却进行着大捕、大杀，城内一次捕了二千人，城外一次捕了四千多人。入会的该捕，抗属该捕，外地生意人该捕，形迹可疑者该捕……，对抗战有功的家属，领导群众的街干、教育界的教师、都给加上了“匪”、“伪”的帽子。捕去后都关到双井街，捆绑起来。这时，他们还仍在唱着他那“宽大政策”“准保释放”，可是，十月十八日在进德会一次就枪毙了十九人，第三天又毙了十六人，用麻袋装上丢到运河里的就更不知有多少了。
    对青壮年则是强迫当兵，并实行保甲制，联保连坐。登记户口后，即把日寇时代的“良民证”盖上蒋记政府的章。每人必有，但这种“良民证”只给他所谓的“良民”，而所谓“匪”、“伪”是不给的。“良民”外出，到城门口得把证拿出来查验，再在请假簿上签名，出去只限三点钟，超过则以“通匪”论罪。每天只上午九时后到下午三时前才准出，因此，市民吃烧不能买，生意没法做。每保里还派一个经过训练的特务担任保队副，本保来客、外出、喜、丧一切事都得报告保队副，与元朝鞑子的办法一样，给各保安上了一个太上皇，这就是蒋介石的警管制。
    由过去民主政府领导下所形成的民主繁荣的济宁市，现在已变成了死城，生意都因捐税太重关门了，即有个别不关门的，也是应付着。大生意则完全破产了，仅玉堂酱园一家，修工费、欢迎费等大数不算外，每天就得给“还乡团”送一百三十斤馍，五挑汤，还有菜，每天又得派四个工人给他们出差。各街上各种摊派都按户摊，不分贫富，柳行街一个卖羊血的小贩，一家三口人都靠他吃饭，现在他的生意不能做了，还摊了修工费、欢迎费、保甲登记费三十斤粮食、五百块钱。他没法活了，就逃出来，他说：“这一个月，城内十家已有六家没饭吃了。”
    济宁的市民们都在长叹着：“鬼子八年没糟塌死咱，老蒋这一个月就把咱糟塌死了。”市民们日夜希望八路军赶快去，同时，他们自己也都在积极想办法，找机会来报仇。现在城附近已变成市民所组织的武工队游击队的世界了。
