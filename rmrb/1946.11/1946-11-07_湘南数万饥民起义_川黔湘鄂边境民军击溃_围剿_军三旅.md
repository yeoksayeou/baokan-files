    In Hunan, armed resistance by peasants against the tyranny of the Kuomintang authorities has spread to various counties in southern, western, and eastern Hunan. In Guiyang, Bin County, and Yongxing in southern Hunan, tens of thousands of starving people have risen in revolt. The "Poor People's Corps" has now expanded to Guidong, Rucheng, Qitianling on the border of Hunan and Guangdong, and Longhushan Pass on the border of Hunan and Guangxi. Thousands of starving people continue to join from various places. The People's Army in western Hunan, led by Peng Chunrong and Qu Bogai, possesses more than 2,000 rifles and 30 machine guns. They have raised the banner of "Commander of the Sichuan-Guizhou-Hunan-Hubei Border Guerrilla," operating in Dayong, Yongshun, Sangzhi, and other counties, and using the Eight-Faced Mountain on the border of Hunan and Hubei as a base, they roam Hubei's Hefeng, and Sichuan's Longshan, Laifeng, and Tongyang counties. In mid-September, Chiang's troops launched a second phase of comprehensive "encirclement and suppression" with three brigades (formerly the 17th Division, 136th Division, and 134th Division), but to no avail. Many of Chiang's officers and soldiers died. Even the demobilized officers and soldiers of Chiang's army have joined forces with the Miao people and are active in the mountainous areas of western Hunan. In eastern Hunan, armed rebellions involving hundreds of people have recently been discovered in Liuyang, Pingjiang, and surrounding areas.

    In the Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou area, in the anti-"village cleansing" struggle in October, the People's Army, including Zhuang Zhiming's troops in Changzhou, attacked the "joint defense team" outposts in Houyu, Qinhe, Xushi, Jinfeng, etc. in the second district of Changzhou on the evening of the "Double Tenth Festival," killing nine people including the team leader Yin Qi, instructor Dai Chuanhou, and capturing one machine gun and one quick-firing gun, and twenty-one rifles. Sun Dan忱, the county magistrate of Changzhou, was therefore punished.

    In Mǎbian County on the border of Yunnan and Sichuan, a certain unit of the People's Army defeated the "encirclement and suppression" by the "police team" in mid-September, capturing alive a squad of people including Police Captain Wu. More than 20 members of a certain People's Army unit in southeastern Yunnan ambushed a Chiang army vehicle near Yanshan County, killing several officers and policemen of Chiang's 93rd Brigade. Another unit of more than 30 people ambushed eight vehicles on October 16 in Yanfang Town, which belongs to Zhanyi County on the eastern Sichuan-Yunnan Road, seizing many supplies.

    In Sichuan's Qi County, Huang Desheng led the establishment of a self-defense organization to resist grain requisition, taxes, and conscription. Near Chongqing, near Yipin, the Chen Zhanyun People's Army unit of fifty or so people, on the 21st of October set an ambush near Dongxi Town, Qijiang County, and killed the Chiang government district chief and over 30 soldiers.
