General Su Yu, the commander of the seven battles and seven victories on the southern line of central Jiangsu, recently participated in organizing the victorious battle to defend Lianshui. His military genius and outstanding achievements in defending the interests of the people shine brightly over the liberated areas of Jiangsu and Anhui. After the armistice agreement was announced this year, General Su Yu devoted all his efforts to presiding over the work of consolidating and demobilizing the army in central China. In order to strive for peace, he repeatedly exercised restraint regarding the Chiang Kai-shek puppet regime's encroachment and offensive against the liberated areas of Jiangsu and Anhui. When the Chiang army, supported by American imperialism, launched a large-scale offensive against the liberated areas of Jiangsu and Anhui in July with a force of 500,000 troops, General Su Yu had no choice but to take self-defense, leading a part of the New Fourth Army to personally block the 150,000 invading Chiang troops on the southern line in central Jiangsu. On July 15th, in the first battle of Yi(bao) Tai(xing), and on the 19th, in the second battle south of Rugao, the entire 19th Brigade (renamed from division, same below) and 26th Brigade of the Chiang army were wiped out successively, and the 79th Brigade was severely damaged. General Su Yu, relying on his far-sighted strategic vision, decisively withdrew from Rugao city. The Chiang army, with five brigades, advanced north from Rugao, and two brigades invaded eastward from Qutang, with seven brigades closely following. General Su Yu, with less than one-twentieth of the Chiang army's strength, killed or wounded 3,000 Chiang troops south of Hai'an, and then moved to a favorable position. The Chiang army continued to advance east from Hai'an, successively capturing Lifaqiao, Xichang, Jiaoxie, Libao and other places, attempting to consolidate its occupied area south of a line stretching west from Taizhou and Jiangyan, through Qutang and Hai'an, to the coast, before advancing north again. General Su Yu, taking advantage of their unstable foothold, launched a surprise counterattack on Libao on August 10th with lightning speed, annihilating most of the garrison of the 105th Brigade, and also wiping out the entire New 7th Brigade, which had opened from Hai'an to the east to provide support, west of Xichang. The Chiang army still attempted to salvage the situation, ensuring the line from Hai'an south through Rugao, Dingyan, Linzi, and Baipufen to Nantong, consolidating the area to the west. General Su Yu's counterattack hammer struck fiercely at Dingyan and Linzi on the 22nd, annihilating two general teams (equivalent to two regiments) of armed special agents "Loyal Salvation" reorganized traffic police, then decisively led the main force into this newly opened gap, turning to the rear of the Chiang army. On the 26th and 27th, on the Rugao-Huangqiao highway, in the towns of Fenjie and Jiali, the entire 99th Brigade and 187th Brigade, as well as a regiment of the remnant 79th Brigade and two battalions of the remnant 105th Brigade, were annihilated successively. Amidst these great victories, the Chiang army attacking Shaobo was heavily damaged and routed, and the important town of Huangqiao was recaptured in one fell swoop, totaling more than 60,000 Chiang troops annihilated and as many as nine Chiang army generals captured. What was the key to the successive victories in the Central Jiangsu Self-Defense War? General Su Yu gave a concise answer, saying: "From the perspective of strategic guidance, it lies in resolutely grasping Chairman Mao's strategic guidance principles, advancing and retreating in big steps, getting rid of passivity, striving for initiative, and seeking to annihilate a large number of the invading army's living forces. We were not without the strength to defend Rugao and Hai'an, but dividing our forces to defend, and holding onto a city or town would not solve the invading Chiang army's overwhelming superiority in troops, and would also put ourselves in a completely passive position, restricted by a city and a town, unable to exert mobility. Therefore, in order to obey the long-term nature of the strategy, in order to get rid of passivity, we inflicted heavy casualties on the invading army, and then took big steps and decisively withdrew from Rugao and Hai'an. After that, the troops seemed to suddenly become ten thousand times lighter, and whenever we wanted to counterattack a place, we counterattacked it. This means that we have already changed from passive to active, and can fully exert our mobility. There is no need to shy away from saying that at that time, we were not in an advantageous position in terms of strategic situation. The Chiang army was relatively superior with Hai'an as the junction point, echoing east and west and connecting north and south. This requires us to use our intelligence, exert a high degree of mobility, and decisively take big steps forward to transform the disadvantage in the strategic situation into an advantage, while continuing to annihilate the living forces of the invading army. The Libao battle was the first step of advancing in big strides, the Dingyan-Linzi battle was the second step, and the tactic of Sun Wukong entering the belly of the Bull Demon King, swooping on the heart of the Chiang army, and suddenly annihilating more than two and a half brigades of the Chiang army, and the three battles on the Rugao-Huangqiao highway was the third step. With these three big steps, the Chiang army in Rugao and Hai'an was completely isolated, and at the same time, the invading army in central Jiangsu had suffered more than 60,000 casualties, accounting for more than 40% of the total force of 150,000, with no follow-up, becoming a spent force. Advancing in big strides must be based on objective circumstances, selecting a point, concentrating superior forces to counterattack in a timely manner, and quickly resolving the battle. It is essential to avoid subjective estimates, dispersing forces, missing opportunities, or delaying the battle indefinitely. This is what I always take as a warning. In the Central Jiangsu Self-Defense War, we managed to study hard the practical application of Mao Zedong's strategic and tactical thinking, coupled with the efforts of all commanders and fighters, and the help of local party, government, military, and civilians, so we achieved victory."

General Su Yu is a teacher-training student by origin, not tall in stature, sincere and humble, gentle and refined. Those who meet him for the first time often think he is a cultured scholar, but do not know that he is a general who wins every battle. But his long nose, especially those bright eyes that illuminate the lungs, show the characteristics of General Su Yu's boldness, meticulousness, alertness and flexibility.

General Su Yu has become the victorious general he is today, enjoying a high prestige among the broad masses of soldiers and civilians, and has historical origins. He joined the famous Fourth Army Independent Regiment's training team under the late General Ye Ting during the Great Revolution, and later joined the Communist Party of China. He has been in the People's Army as a squad leader, deputy platoon leader, instructor, company, battalion, regiment, division commander and political commissar, going through many years of training. He has a deep personal experience of the hardships of lower-level commanders and fighters and the actual situation of the troops, and has also developed the habit of constantly paying attention at any time. Therefore, in the actual command of operations, he is known for being able to take care of the actual situation of the soldiers, guide specific details, and urge strict checks.

After the "September 18th" Incident, the CCP called on the whole country to resist Japan, and then General Fang Zhimin was the commander of the Northern Anti-Japanese Pioneer Team from Jiangxi. At that time, General Su Yu was Fang's chief of staff. Later, General Fang was arrested and died heroically, and Su succeeded as commander, persisting in the work of the anti-Japanese united front in the border area of ​​Jiangxi and Fujian for three years. In 1938, the New Fourth Army was established, and General Su Yu's Anti-Japanese Pioneer Team was temporarily formed into a detachment. It first arrived in Jiangnan, bringing the hope of victory to the silent hearts of the people in Jiangnan, and igniting the anti-Japanese flames in the mountainous villages and water towns of Jiangnan, close to the enemy and puppet heartland. After the New Fourth Army advanced eastward, the Northern Jiangsu Headquarters was established, and General Su Yu served as deputy commander. After the Southern Anhui Incident, General Commander Chen Yi went to the Northern Jiangsu Military Region, and General Su Yu began to independently preside over the opening up and construction of the anti-Japanese democratic base area in central Jiangsu in the new position of commander of the First Division of the New Fourth Army and commander of the Central Jiangsu Military Region, leading the military and civilians of central Jiangsu to persist in the struggle against the enemy. In 1942 alone, he fought more than 500 battles, successively smashing countless cruel offensives by the Japanese invaders' "mopping up", "political mopping up", "high-intensity mopping up" and "extended mopping up", protecting and continuously expanding the liberated area of ​​central Jiangsu.

In the winter of 1944, in order to welcome and cooperate with the Allied counter-offensive, General Su Yu personally led the Third Column of the First Division to the south, and took office as the commander of the Central Jiangsu Military Region. There, he developed new anti-Japanese base areas and repelled many joint offensives by the enemy and puppets. After the great counter-offensive began last year, General Su Yu led his troops to liberate ten county towns in western Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu, including Anji, Changxing, Guangde, Langxi, Gaochun, Lishui, Yixing, Liyang, Jintan, Jurong, and vast areas. The Zhejiang East Column under the command of General Su Yu had marched to Pudong Nanhui and joined forces on the bank of the Huangpu River. It would not have been difficult to directly attack Nanjing and Shanghai, but in order to strive for the realization of national peace and democracy, General Su Yu and his troops bid farewell to the people of Jiangnan with tears and resolutely led their troops to withdraw north across the river in early October, taking office as the commander of the Central China Field Army of the New Fourth Army and deputy commander of the Central China Military Region. The history of General Su Yu is a history of arduous struggle for national and people's liberation. Today, General Su Yu has become a victorious banner for the military and civilians of Jiangsu and Anhui. The soldiers said: "Fighting is the happiest thing, we never lose battles." Recently, the people of Taixian presented Commander Su with a plaque that read "Commander Su wins every battle."

    粟裕将军
    蒯斯曛
    苏中南线七战七捷的指挥者、新四军华中野战军司令粟裕将军，最近又参与组织了涟水保卫战的胜利战役。他的军事天才和保卫人民利益卓著的功绩，光辉的照耀着苏皖解放区。当今年停战协定公布后，粟裕将军在华中全力主持整军复员工作，为了争取和平，对于蒋伪对苏皖解放区的蚕食进攻曾不惜再三忍让，到了七月蒋军在美帝国主义支持下，竟以五十万之众大举进攻苏皖解放区时，粟裕将军乃不得不采取自卫，统率新四军一部，亲到苏中阻击南线十五万进犯蒋军。七月十五日一战宜（堡）泰（兴），十九日再战如皋以南，先后消灭蒋军十九旅（由师改称以下均同）、二十六旅全部，重创七十九旅后，粟裕将军凭他远大的战略眼光，断然退出如皋城，蒋军以五旅之众由如皋北犯，以两旅之众从曲塘东侵，七个旅紧靠前进。粟裕将军以不及蒋军廿分之一的兵力，在海安以南杀伤蒋军三千人后，又转移到有利阵地。蒋军继续由海安东犯，连陷立发桥、西场、角斜、李堡等地，正企图巩固其西起泰州、姜，中经曲塘、海安，东迄海边一线以南侵占地区再行北犯。粟裕将军乘其立足未定，以迅雷之势于八月十日突然反击李堡，尽歼其驻军一○五旅大部，同时并将海安东开援军新七旅全部消灭于西场以西。蒋军仍图收拾残局，确保自海安向南经如皋、丁、林梓、白蒲坟至南通一线，巩固以西地区。粟裕将军的反击铁锤乃于二日猛击丁堰、林梓，消灭武装特务“忠救”改编的交通警察两个总队（等于两个团）后，断然统率大军涌进这新打开的缺口，转入蒋军后方。于二十六、七两日先后在如皋、黄桥公路上分界、加力两镇，歼灭九十九旅及一八七旅全部和七十九旅残部一个团一○五旅残部两个营。在这大捷声中，猛攻邵伯蒋军既受重创而溃退，黄桥重镇也一举克复，总计先后歼灭蒋军六万余，俘虏蒋军将官达九人之多。指挥苏中自卫战连战皆捷的关键究竟在那里呢？粟裕将军作了一个精辟的回答，他说：“单以战略指导方面说，是在于坚决把握毛主席的战略指导原则，大踏步前进，大踏步后退，摆脱被动，争取主动，求得大量消灭进犯军的有生力量。如皋海安我们不是没有力量守，但分兵拒守，死守一城一镇不能解决在兵力上远处优势的进犯蒋军，也使自己陷于完全被动的地位，受一城一镇的束缚，无法发挥机动性。所以为了服从战略的长期性，为了摆脱被动，我们才予进犯军以重大杀伤，以后踏开大步，断然撤出如皋海安，那以后部队就仿佛突然轻捷了万倍，什么时候要反击什么地方就什么时候反击，这就是说，我们已经由被动转为主动，可以充分发挥机动性。用不着讳言，当时在战略形势上我们并不处于有利的地位，蒋军以海安为联结点，东西呼应，南北相连，是比较优越的，这就必须运用我们的智力，发挥高度的机动，断然踏开大步前进，来转变战略形势上的劣势为优势，同时继续消灭进犯军的有生力量。李堡战斗是大踏步前进的第一步，丁堰林梓战斗是第二步，以孙行者钻进牛魔王肚子的战术，猛扑蒋军心腹，突然歼灭蒋军两个半旅以上，三战如黄公路是第三步。这三个大步一踏，如皋海安蒋军完全陷于孤立，同时苏中进犯军前后已遭受六万人以上的损失，占总兵力十五万人的百分之四十以上，后续不继，成了强弩之末。大踏步前进，必须根据客观情况，择定一点，集中优势力量及时反击，迅速解决战斗，切忌主观估计，分散力量，丧失时机，或者使战役拖延不决，这是我时引为警惕的。在苏中自卫战中，总算努力学习了毛泽东战略战术思想的实际运用，加之全体指战员的努力，和地方党政军民的帮助，因而得到了胜利。”
    粟裕将军是师范学生出身，身材不高，诚恳谦虚，温文尔雅，初识者常以为是一个有素养的学者，而不知他是一个百战百胜的将军。但他那隆长的鼻子，特别是那一双炯炯发光照人肺腑的眼睛，却显示出粟裕将军胆大心细机警灵活的特性。
    粟裕将军成为今天这样一个常胜将军，在广大军民中享有高度威信，是有其历史渊源的。他自从在大革命时代参加了故叶挺将军所部著名的第四军独立团的学员队，后来又加入中国共产党，一直在人民军队里从班长、副连长、指导员、连营团师长及政委，经过了多年的锻炼，对于下级指战员的甘苦和部队的实际情况具有极深的亲身体验，也养成了随时不断地注意的习惯，因此在作战的实际指挥中，又以能照顾战士实际情形，指导具体细心，督促检查严格抓紧著称。
    “九一八”后，中共号召全国抗日，接着以方志敏将军为司令从江西出动了北上抗日先遣队。当时粟裕将军是方的参谋长，后来方将军被捕壮烈牺牲，粟即继任司令，在赣闽边坚持抗日统一战线工作达三年之久。一九三八年，新四军成立，粟裕将军所部抗日先遣队，暂编为一个支队，首先到达江南，给江南沉闷的人心带来了胜利的希望，把漫天抗日烽火点起在江南紧靠敌伪心腹的山乡水国。新四军东进后，成立苏北指挥部，粟裕将军任副指挥，皖南惨案发生，总指挥陈毅将军去苏北军部，粟裕将军即以新四军一师师长兼苏中军区司令新职，开始独立主持苏中抗日民主根据地的开辟与建设工作，领导苏中军民坚持对敌斗争。仅一九四二年一年即作战五百余次，先后粉碎了日寇“清乡”、“政治清乡”、“高度清乡”、“延期清乡”无数次惨酷的进攻，保卫并不断扩大了苏中解放区。
    四四年冬，为了迎接和配合盟军反攻，粟裕将军又亲率一师三纵队南下，就任苏中军区司令。在那里，又发展了新的抗日根据地，击退了多次敌伪的联合进攻。去年大反攻开始后，粟裕将军领导所部解放了浙西与苏南之安吉、长兴、广德、郎溪、高、溧水、宜兴、溧阳、金坛、句容等十个县城，及广大地区。在粟裕将军指挥下的浙东纵队已进军到浦东南汇，会师黄浦江边，本不难直捣京沪，但为了争取全国和平民主的实现，粟裕将军及其所部泣别江南人民，毅然率部于十月初旬渡江北撤，就任新四军华中野战军司令兼华中军区副司令。粟裕将军的历史，就是一部为民族与人民解放艰苦奋斗的历史，今天粟裕将军成了苏皖军民胜利的旗帜。战士们说：“打仗最高兴，从来不会打败仗。”最近泰县人民送给粟司令的匾上写着“粟司令打仗仗仗胜”。
