　　Yuci Landlords Who Fled All Cry Out for the Liberated Area

　　[Our Newspaper News] Landlords who fled to the Yan puppet area during the mass movement in Yuci could not bear the extortion and oppression of the Yan puppet regime and all cried out for the Liberated Area. According to reports from the county's correspondents: For every stone of grain transported by the landlords from the Liberated Area to the Yan puppet area, eight dou had to be handed over as tax, and livestock carts were requisitioned for service every day. The family members of the landlords who fled to the Yan puppet area were forced to become soldiers if they were young and strong, and the elderly were forced to work. Housing was extremely scarce, with men and women living together in each room, with as many as twenty people挤 crammed onto one kang (platform bed). Each room cost 10,000 yuan per week to rent, and two shopkeepers had to be found as guarantors. Once settled, people could not move around freely. Burning one jin of sorghum stalks cost 100 yuan. The landlords who fled were constantly extorted by the Yan puppet army. After one landlord family from Futang Village in the county moved to the city, they were driven to live on the stage of the Nan Yao Village stronghold in the Yan puppet area, and they were constantly "taken care of." They were called 老财 (lao cai, "old wealth") and asked to borrow money. When he said he had none, the Yan army immediately glared and said, "I think you are suspected of being a Eighth Route Army sympathizer!" A landlord in his sixties from Beitian Village ran to Nan Yao stronghold to settle down, but the Yan puppet army forced him to take two hand grenades and enrolled him in the "Revenge Squad." The landlord cried all the way, regretting his decision and saying, "I made the wrong choice!" (Zhao Guangdi, Zhang Guofeng, Tian Yanbao, Yang Shumin)

　　榆次逃亡地主都哭念解放区
    【本报讯】榆次群运中逃往阎伪区之地主受不了阎伪之勒索压榨，都哭念解放区。据该县通讯员报导：地主们从解放区运到阎伪区的粮食，每石要交公八斗，牲口大车每日支差。逃往阎伪区之地主家属，青壮强迫当兵，老年给作工。住房奇缺，每间房子要男女共住，一盘炕上竟有挤二十余人之多，每间房一星期就得出赁价一万元，并得找好二家铺保，既住下后不能随便行动。烧一斤高粱杆要花一百元。逃去的地主随时遭到阎伪军的勒索，该县福堂村一家地主搬到城里后，被赶到阎伪区据点南要村戏台上去住，并不时的去“照料”他，称呼他老财向他借钱，他说没有。阎军立刻翻眼说：“我看你有八路军嫌疑！”北田村有个六十多岁的地主跑到南要据点安家，但阎伪军强迫给他两颗手榴弹，把他编了“复仇队”，该地主一路哭着后悔的说：“我的主意打错啦！”（赵光第、张国锋、田砚宝、杨树敏）
