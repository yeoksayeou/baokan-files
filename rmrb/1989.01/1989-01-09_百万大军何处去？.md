	The continuous expansion of construction projects over the past few years has led to a bloated workforce in China's construction industry. By the end of 1987, the number of construction enterprises had grown to over 57,000, an increase of more than 30,000 compared to 1980. The workforce had increased by 8.91 million, reaching a total of 24 million. Rural construction teams have also emerged, accounting for more than half of the total workforce. "The entire country is a construction site, with scaffolding everywhere," and construction projects can be seen everywhere.

	The pressure on the construction sector due to reduced construction investments is immense. However, this pressure can also serve as a driving force, pushing the construction sector to face reality, broaden its horizons, and change the chaotic situation in the construction market, paving the way for steady development in the industry. Of course, overcoming current difficulties relies not only on the construction sector but also requires coordinated efforts from various regions and departments to get through the tough times.

	For a long time, China's construction industry has operated under a single "registration" system, where any team, regardless of its quality, can independently undertake construction projects. On one hand, this has increased employment opportunities, allowing farmers to enter cities without restrictions, disrupting the old mechanisms of state-owned construction enterprises and promoting urban-rural economic development. On the other hand, it has also led to a chaotic situation among construction teams, with a mix of good and bad practices.

	Reducing construction investments provides a good opportunity to rectify the construction teams. According to the plan proposed by the Ministry of Construction, construction enterprises will accelerate the implementation of the "three orientations"—facing society, facing towns and villages, and facing the international market. For state-owned construction enterprises, some elite teams will be organized to compete in domestic and international markets, while the rest can be divided into smaller units, transitioning from state-owned to collective and public to private, engaging in diversified operations and developing the tertiary industry.

	Some farmer construction teams may need to "return home." It is reported that Tianjin plans to issue regulations prohibiting out-of-town construction and installation enterprises from independently undertaking projects in the city. For the several million farmer workers active in urban construction, psychological imbalances are inevitable. Farmer construction teams are an important part of China's township enterprises, especially for farmers in impoverished areas, where entering the city to engage in construction is a crucial path to poverty alleviation and prosperity. Unconditionally dismissing them is not a good strategy. Finding a solution that suits China's national conditions is an urgent and challenging task.

	How can the construction industry not only overcome current difficulties but also achieve the best results for stable development in the future? Relevant officials believe that the most urgent task is to seize the current opportunity and focus on the following aspects:

	First, strengthen management and turn the off-season for tasks into a peak season for management. Strict qualifications review should be conducted on construction teams, changing the previous single "registration" management system to a "permit" system that combines qualification review and registration. Before undertaking projects, enterprises should present their representative works, and the contracting party should examine the construction enterprise's credibility, experience, qualifications, management level, and the proportion of technical personnel.

	Second, implement macro-control. It is understood that the state will no longer establish new construction enterprises, and for existing enterprises, under the premise of strengthening qualification management, control the flow of teams. Low-level construction enterprises will be restricted to specific construction scopes, which to some extent weakens the unethical practices within the construction industry and reduces the pressure on railway transportation caused by the unrestricted flow of construction teams.

	Third, enable construction enterprises to quickly transform during periods without tasks. In this regard, many departments and regions have accumulated some experience. For example, the coal industry has implemented a method where part of the construction workers are transferred to production workers after completing construction projects, with good results. Guangdong Province has allowed state-owned first and second-level construction enterprises to engage in real estate development. Additionally, policies should be adopted to allow construction workers to find jobs based on their personal strengths and interests, engaging in diversified operations.

	Experts believe that, from a long-term perspective, construction enterprises should develop towards having comprehensive contracting capabilities in research and development, engineering design, construction, procurement, etc., promoting the experience of Lubuge, and advancing the separation of management and operations in large state-owned enterprises. The core of the new construction teams should be elite forces after optimization. During the off-season, enterprises should be able to bear the burden of idle workers; during the peak season, local labor or temporary farmers and contract workers should be used to form a construction army. When there is work, they can go; when there is no work, they can disperse.

　　百万大军何处去？
    本报记者  杨涌
    连续几年的基建规模膨胀，导致了我国施工队伍的臃肿。到１９８７年底，施工企业已发展到５７０００多个，比１９８０年增加了３万多个，职工增加了８９１万人，达到２４００万人。农村建筑施工队伍异军突起，占总人数的一半以上。“全国一个大工地，满处尽见脚手架”，基建摊子随处可见。
    基建下马，人员过剩，建筑部门的压力是很大的。但压力又何尝不是一种动力呢？它逼得建筑部门正视现实，放宽眼界，改变过去建筑市场混乱的局面，走出一条建筑业稳步发展的路子来。当然，克服眼前的困难，单靠建设部门是远远不够的，还必须依靠各地区各部门统筹安排，渡过难关。
    我国建筑施工行业，长期以来实行的是单一的“注册”登记制度，即不论队伍的素质怎样，均可独立承包工程。这样，一方面使就业机会增多，农民进城不受限制，冲击了国营建筑企业的旧机制，推动了城乡经济的发展；另一方面，也使施工队伍呈现混乱局面，良莠不分的现象十分突出。
    压缩基建投资，给了建筑业整顿施工队伍一个绝好时机。按照建设部提出的方案，建筑施工企业今后将加快实行“三个面向”——面向社会、面向村镇、面向国际市场。对全民施工企业，除将部分精兵强将组织起来，投入国内外市场竞争外，其余的可通过化大为小、化整为零，变全民为集体、变公营为私营的途径，开展多种经营，发展第三产业。
    有些农民建筑队可能要“打回老家去”。据悉，天津市准备作出规定，不允许外地建筑安装企业进津独立承包工程。对活跃在城镇建设战线上的几百万农民工来说，心理的不平衡是难以避免的。农民建筑队是我国乡镇企业的重要组成部分，尤其对贫困地区的农民来说，进城搞建筑，是农村脱贫致富的重要途径，无条件清退他们，并非良策。寻求一个适合我国国情的解决办法，显然是一项迫切而又难度颇大的任务。
    如何使建筑业既渡过难关，又可达到今后稳定发展的最佳效果？有关方面人士认为，最迫切的是应当抓准当前这个时机，抓好以下几方面的工作：
    首先是抓好管理，把任务的淡季变成管理的旺季。要对施工队伍进行严格的资质审查，变过去单一的“注册”管理制度为资审、注册并举的“许可”制度。企业在承包工程前，须拿出自己的代表作，发包单位在信誉、经历、资历、管理水平、技术人员所占的比重等方面对施工企业予以考查。
    第二，在宏观上予以调控。据了解，今后国家不再成立新的施工企业，对现有企业，在加强资质管理的前提下，控制队伍流向。级别低的施工企业将限制在特定的施工范围内，既在一定程度上减弱了施工行业内的不正之风，也减轻了因施工队伍的无限制流动造成的铁路交通的压力。
    第三，使施工企业在没有任务的情况下，能迅速得到转轨变型。这方面，不少部门、地方已积累了一定经验。如煤炭行业实行了在建项目完成后部分基建工人转为生产工人的办法，效果很好。广东省已允许国营一、二级施工企业从事房地产开发。此外，还要在政策上采取措施，准许建筑工人根据个人特长和兴趣，自谋职业，搞多种经营。
    专家们认为，从长远的观点看，施工企业应当向具有科研开发、工程设计、施工、采购等综合承包能力的方向发展，推广鲁布革经验，推进国有大型企业管理层与作业层的分离。新型施工队伍的核心当是经过优化组合后的精兵强将。施工淡季时，企业有能力承受歇工的负担；旺季时，就地使用劳力或临时引进农民工、合同工，组成建筑大军。有活能上，无活可散。
