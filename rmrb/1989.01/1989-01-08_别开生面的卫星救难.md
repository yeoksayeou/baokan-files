An international satellite rescue system jointly developed by the United States, Canada, France, and the Soviet Union has recently been put into operation.

This satellite rescue system consists of 4 satellites in geostationary orbits at altitudes of 850-1000 kilometers. These satellites scan the same region every 100 minutes, covering a width of 5000 kilometers, to receive distress signals from ships, vehicles, and aircraft. Once a distress signal is received, it is relayed at a frequency of 1544 MHz to one of the 6 satellite data reception stations located around the world. The reception station quickly calculates the coordinates of the distress signal and sends them to the rescue command center, which then organizes the rescue operation.

Before the advent of rescue satellites, search and rescue operations primarily relied on aircraft, ships, and ground stations. Due to limitations in visibility and the lack of efficient communication methods, distress signals from ships and aircraft often went unanswered. Even when a distress signal was received, it was difficult to quickly determine the location of the incident, often delaying timely rescue efforts. Satellites, however, have a wide field of view and can cover vast areas. By launching a few satellites at appropriate altitudes and positions, they can be used sequentially for intercontinental or global communication. Within the satellite's coverage area, whether in space, on land, or at sea, multi-point connections can be established to transmit high-quality information. This makes satellite communication ideal for search and rescue operations.

　　别开生面的卫星救难
    一个由美国、加拿大、法国和苏联合作研制的国际卫星救援系统，最近正式投入运行。
    上述卫星救援系统拥有４颗定点在８５０—１０００公里高空的极地轨道上的卫星。这些卫星每１００分钟从同一地区上方扫描一次，宽度为５０００公里，以接收船只、车辆和飞机遇难后发出的求救信号。一旦收到求救信号，并用１５４４兆赫频率转发给位于世界各地的６个卫星数据接收站，由数据接收站迅速算出求救信号的坐标，然后发送给救援指挥中心，由该中心组织营救。
    在救援卫星问世以前，搜索和营救主要靠飞机、船只和地面站。由于受视距的限制，又缺少高效的通信手段，失事船只和飞机发出的呼救信号常常会收不到；有时收到了呼救信号，又难以迅速确定失事地点，往往耽误对遇难者的及时救援。卫星高悬中天，视野开阔，只要按适当高度和位置发射几颗，就可以依次转换使用这些卫星进行洲际通信或全球通信。在卫星的覆盖范围内，不论是空间、地面或海上，都能实现多址联结，高质量地传递信息，这对搜索和营救无疑是最理想的了。
