The party organization has prioritized ideological, moral, and disciplinary education, and workers at the Xingtai Tractor Factory have strengthened their sense of ownership.

At the end of 1988, the Xingtai Tractor Factory in Hebei Province was named an advanced unit for worker moral education by the city and bureau. This marks the third consecutive year the factory has received this honor.

The "Xingtai Tractor" factory, with over 3,100 workers, is a key enterprise under the Ministry of Mechanical and Electronic Industry. A few years ago, some workers in the factory had issues such as lax discipline, lack of cooperation, and selfish behavior. The factory's party committee believed that without a spiritual pillar, the enterprise could be ruined by bad winds and evil customs. Therefore, they decided to carry out extensive and in-depth vocational moral education and launched the "Be a 'Xingtai Tractor' person, create a first-class enterprise" campaign among the workers.

The gear workshop, which was named an advanced party branch by the provincial committee, had some young workers who once had thoughts like "young people are unhappy, old people are white (passive)" and did not take their work seriously. Instead of striving for excellence in their skills, they were content with mediocrity, leading to a decline or stagnation in product quality. The party branch addressed this issue by combining vocational moral education with ideological education, proposing the slogan "have ideals, love your profession." They encouraged young workers to actively identify problems, express their thoughts, and find the root causes, helping most young workers not only clarify their long-term goals of revitalizing China and benefiting the people but also establish detailed vocational moral norms. Previously, the foundry workshop had issues between the large furnace class and the casting class, with each blaming the other for problems. The large furnace class accused the casting class of slow actions, and the casting class blamed the large furnace class for low iron water temperature. This conflict between upstream and downstream processes created many passive situations for other workshops. The factory's party committee then proposed the slogan "upstream processes serve downstream processes, the entire factory serves the users" and combined vocational moral education with disciplinary education over a relatively long period. This effectively resolved the supply and demand conflicts between upstream and downstream processes, ensuring balanced production. The sales department's staff had once thought of becoming "sitting merchants" when products were in high demand. During the vocational moral education, the factory's party committee helped them discuss "my responsibility for improving party style," encouraging them to actively identify problems, establish norms, and launch a competition for excellent service. This eliminated the previous attitude of "difficult to enter, difficult to see, difficult to hear, difficult to handle," replacing it with a warm reception and door-to-door visits for users.

Through the "three-in-one" vocational moral education, the workers at "Xingtai Tractor" effectively strengthened their sense of ownership. The workers proposed that "Xingtai Tractor" people should have the spirit of striving to create a first-class enterprise, a style of considering the overall situation, skills of pursuing excellence, a concept of being ahead, and a responsibility of revitalizing China. In 1988, various workshops and teams revised their vocational moral norms 125 times based on changing situations. In the past four months, the entire factory developed new products such as agricultural three-wheeled motorcycles and lightweight combined generators convenient for individual users far from cities, which were well-received by users.

　　党组织重视理想道德纪律教育    
    邢台拖拉机厂职工主人翁精神增强
    本报讯  １９８８年底，河北省邢台拖拉机厂被市、局评为职工道德教育先进单位。至此，该厂连续３年获得这一荣誉。
    拥有３１００多名职工的“邢拖”，是机械电子工业部的重点企业。头几年这个厂一些职工一度出现了纪律松弛、不讲协作、损人利己等不良现象。厂党委认为，企业若是没有精神支柱，便有可能被歪风邪气断送。于是决定广泛深入地进行职业道德教育，在职工中开展“做‘邢拖人’，创一流企业”活动。
    曾被省委命名为先进党支部的齿轮车间，有的青年工人一度存在“青年不乐，到老白过”等无所用心的思想，技术上不是精益求精，而是得过且过，致使产品质量不是下降，便是原地踏步。党支部针对这种现象，将职业道德教育与理想教育结合起来，提出“有理想，爱本职”的口号，启发青年工人主动查问题，亮思想，找根源，使大多数青工不仅明确了振兴中华、造福人民的长远目标，而且制订了明细的职业道德规范。过去，铸铁车间的大炉班与浇铸班常常互相抱怨，推诿责任。浇铸班指责上道工序的大炉班铁水温度低，大炉班责怪浇铸班倒火动作慢。上下工序班组闹别扭，给其他工段带来许多被动。厂党委便响亮提出“上道工序为下道工序服务，全厂为用户服务”的口号，并且用较长的时间，将职业道德教育与纪律教育结合起来进行，较好地解决了上下工序的供求矛盾，保证了平衡生产。厂销售科的人员在产品走俏的情况下，曾产生过当“坐商”的思想。在职业道德教育中，厂党委帮助他们开展了“我对党风好转应有的责任”的讨论，启发他们主动查问题，订规范，掀起优质服务竞赛。这样，过去那种“门难进，脸难看，话难听，事难办”的服务态度消灭了，取而代之的是对用户热情接待，登门拜访。
    “邢拖”通过“三结合”的职业道德教育，有效地增强了职工的主人翁精神。工人们提出，“邢拖人”应当具有争创一流企业的精神，顾全大局的风格，精益求精的技能，勇于超前的观念，振兴中华的责任。１９８８年，各车间、班组根据变化了的情况，主动修订职业道德规范达１２５条。近４个月中，全厂开发出农用三轮摩托车、方便远离城镇个体户使用的轻型组合发电机等新产品，深受用户欢迎。
