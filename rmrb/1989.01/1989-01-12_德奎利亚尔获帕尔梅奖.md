Pérez de Cuéllar Receives Palme Prize

	The People's Daily, Stockholm, January 10th — Correspondent Gu Yaoming reports: United Nations Secretary-General Pérez de Cuéllar was awarded the 1988 Olof Palme Prize this afternoon here.

	The award ceremony was held grandly at the Stockholm Concert Hall. The chairman of the Olof Palme Memorial Foundation and Swedish Foreign Minister Sten Andersson, in his speech, pointed out that 1988 was not only a year of progress in the cause of peace but also a year in which the United Nations made significant breakthroughs in maintaining and achieving peace. Awarding this year's Olof Palme Prize to Pérez de Cuéllar is to commend "under his leadership, the United Nations has brought hope of peace to the world," and it is also a recognition of the contributions made by all members participating in the United Nations peacekeeping activities to the cause of peace.

	Swedish Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson also spoke at the ceremony, praising Pérez de Cuéllar for his unremitting efforts to promote the peace process and for playing a very special and important role in the history of the United Nations.

	The Palme Memorial Fund was established by Palme's family and the Swedish Social Democratic Party to commemorate this former Swedish Prime Minister, to honor individuals who have made outstanding contributions to promoting peace and international understanding. This year's Palme Prize is worth 100,000 Swedish kronor. Pérez de Cuéllar said at the award ceremony that he would use this prize money to establish the Palme Trust Fund to provide scholarships for students studying peace.
