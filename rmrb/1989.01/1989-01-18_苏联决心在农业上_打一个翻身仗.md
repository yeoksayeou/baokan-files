The Soviet Union is currently facing numerous economic issues, with the most urgent being the problems in agriculture and the resulting food supply shortages. Although agricultural production has seen some growth over the past three years of reform, it has not been enough to reverse the trend of food shortages. Since the 19th Party Congress of the CPSU last year, the Central Committee has held several meetings to discuss agricultural issues, concluding that this is not just an economic problem but a fundamental social and political issue that affects the people's livelihoods and the progress of reform. To address this, Gorbachev announced that the Soviet Union will "fight a decisive battle on the food front!" Subsequently, the CPSU Central Committee decided to hold a plenary session in February to formulate new measures for accelerating agricultural development.

For a long time, Soviet agricultural production has stagnated. The root cause, according to Soviet leaders and scholars, is that the economic system in rural areas has not undergone fundamental reform. Economists believe that the current economic relations in rural areas do not motivate workers to be proactive and creative. The disconnect between people, land, and means of production has turned farmers or agricultural workers into hired laborers rather than owners. With little benefit from working in the countryside, many have moved to the cities to work.

In recent years, Soviet economists have also noticed another issue: private plots, which make up less than 3% of arable land, produce more than 30% of the nation's grain. Many scholars point out that the forced collectivization of agriculture, which began in 1927, was a serious mistake. This movement suppressed a large number of middle peasants who did not want to join collective farms, severely dampening the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers, and had a negative impact on agriculture. Later, through continuous mergers and combinations, the scale of collective farms was made increasingly large. This further reduced the interest of the broad masses of farmers in land and agricultural operations, leading to a decline in agricultural labor productivity and stagnation in production for more than 20 years.

Recently, in the Oryol region south of Moscow, Gorbachev personally chaired an unprecedented on-site agricultural conference. Although agricultural production in the Oryol region had stagnated for the past 20 years, it has undergone significant changes in the past three years: grain production increased by 46%, sugar beet production by 36%, feed production doubled, and meat supply to farmers increased by one-third. The main experience was the implementation of collective contracting and leasing, and the improvement of management methods. The five farms and state farms in the region that implemented the leasing system saw grain yields double in just one or two years, and milk production per cow increased by nearly one ton per year. Participants from all over the Soviet Union were greatly inspired.

The CPSU Central Committee recently made a series of decisions: to promote the leasing and contracting system nationwide, leasing land and other means of production to farmers for long periods, signing contracts that last 25 to 50 years; to dissolve long-loss-making farms and state farms, transferring their land and means of production to farms and state farms with high operating efficiency, industrial enterprises, and collective and individual lessees; to reform the current management system of agro-industrial complexes, which issues orders through the administrative system, and first establish voluntary management organizations composed of farms and state farms at the district and regional levels to replace district agro-industrial companies and the like.

In addition, the CPSU Central Committee decided to allocate 77 billion rubles to improve the transportation, storage, and processing of agricultural products, reduce losses at various stages of agricultural production, and increase food production by 20% to 30% under current conditions. At the same time, every effort will be made to encourage the development of personal sideline production.

However, Soviet leaders pointed out that there is significant resistance to implementing the leasing and contracting system. Firstly, officials are accustomed to the old ways and bureaucratic methods of work. Secondly, many loss-making farms and state farms use loans and other methods to support their finances, and the wages of workers there are not less than those in well-managed farms and state farms, which naturally affects the promotion of the contracting system.

Whether the deepening of agricultural reform in the Soviet Union can proceed smoothly and whether agricultural production can see significant development in the near future are crucial issues for the overall reform and economic revitalization of the Soviet Union. Therefore, people are closely watching the upcoming CPSU Central Committee plenary session dedicated to agricultural issues.

　　苏联决心在农业上“打一个翻身仗”
    方荣萱
    当前，苏联经济面临的所有问题中，农业问题以及由此引起的食品供应问题，是最为迫切的问题。改革３年来，农业产量虽有一些增长，但未能扭转食品短缺现象。自去年苏共第１９次代表会议以后，苏共中央接连开会研究农业问题，认为这个问题不只是单纯的经济问题，而是关系到人民切身利益，直接影响改革进程的“根本的社会政治问题”。为此，戈尔巴乔夫宣布，苏联将“在食品战线打一个翻身仗！”接着，苏共中央决定在２月召开中央全会，制订加速发展农业的新措施。
    长期以来，苏联农业生产停滞不前。原因何在？苏联领导人和学者经过反复研究认为，关键的问题，是农村的经济体制没有进行根本改革，经济学家们认为当前农村的经济关系不能调动劳动者的积极性和创造性。人与土地、生产资料脱节，农民或农业职工实际上已成为雇佣劳动者，而不是主人。人们在农村所得好处不多，便纷纷进城做工。
    近年来，苏联经济学家们还注意到这样一个问题：私人自留地占可耕地不到３％，但生产的粮食超过了全国供应粮食的３０％。许多学者指出，苏联从１９２７年开始，强制推行的农业集体化运动，是一个严重的错误。这一运动打击了大批不愿参加集体农庄的中农，严重挫伤了广大农民的生产积极性，对农业造成了消极影响。以后又不断通过合并、联合，把集体农庄的规模搞得越来越大。这样，更使广大农民对土地、对经营农业失去了兴趣，数百万有经验的农民离开了农村，导致农业劳动生产率的下降，２０多年间生产停滞不前。
    最近，在莫斯科以南的奥廖尔州，戈尔巴乔夫亲自主持召开了“史无前例的”农业现场会议。奥廖尔州农业生产过去２０年停滞不前，但最近３年却发生了很大变化：粮食产量增长４６％，甜菜产量增长３６％，饲料生产增长１倍，对农民的肉类供应增长１／３。其主要经验是实行集体承包和租赁制，改进管理方法。该州实行租赁制的５个农庄和农场，实行租赁一两年便使粮食单产增长１倍多，每头牛一年产奶量增长近１吨。从苏联全国各地来此参加会议的人受到很大启发。
    苏共中央最近作出一系列决定：普遍推广租赁承包制，把土地和其他生产资料长期租给农民，订立长达２５年乃至５０年的承包合同；撤销长期亏损的农庄、农场，将其土地和生产资料转让给经营效率高的农庄、农场、工业企业以及集体和个体的租赁者；着手改革依照行政系统下达命令的现行的农工综合体管理体制，首先在区和州一级建立由农庄、农场自愿组建的联合管理机构取代区农工联合公司等。
    此外，苏共中央还决定，拨款７７０亿卢布以改善农产品的运输、贮存和扩大加工能力，减少农产品生产过程各个环节中的损失，以便在现有条件下增加２０％—３０％的食品产量。同时，要千方百计地鼓励发展个人副业。
    但是，苏联领导人指出，推行租赁承包制的阻力是很大的，首先是干部已习惯了旧的一套，习惯于官僚主义的工作方法。再有就是，很多亏损的农庄农场用借贷等方法支撑财政，那里的劳动者的工资照常，并不比经营好的农庄、农场的劳动者少，这自然影响承包制的推行。
    苏联农业的深入改革能否顺利进行，农业生产在近期内能否有较大发展，这是关系到苏联整个改革和经济振兴的重要问题。因此，人们正关注着即将召开的专门研究农业问题的苏共中央全会。
