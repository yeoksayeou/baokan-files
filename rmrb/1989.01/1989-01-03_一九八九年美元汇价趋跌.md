Title: The Dollar's Downward Trend in 1989

Today is the last trading day of 1988 for the London foreign exchange market. At the close, the dollar's exchange rate against the West German Mark and the Japanese Yen was 1:1.7720 and 1:125.20, respectively. The British pound's exchange rate against the dollar rose to 1:1.8090.

From December 31, 1987, to December 30, 1988, the dollar's exchange rate against the West German Mark rose by 12.9%, and against the Japanese Yen by 3.5%. Only against the British pound did it fall by 4.3%. The dollar's stability in 1988 was due to the concerted efforts of the central banks of the seven major Western industrialized countries and the widening interest rate differential between the U.S. and West Germany and Japan, which increased the attractiveness of dollar assets.

However, 1988 was not a good year for the dollar. On January 4, 1988, the dollar opened poorly, falling to a record low of 1:120.20 yen and 1:1.5615 West German Marks in the Tokyo market. By December 30, 1988, the dollar's exchange rate against the West German Mark and the Japanese Yen was still 38% and 48.6% lower, respectively, than at the time of the "Plaza Accord" in September 1985. Authorities believe that the dollar will resume its overall downward trend in 1989 since 1985.

David Cohen, the chief economist of the National Westminster Bank, Britain's largest clearing bank, recently told Xinhua that all actions related to the dollar's exchange rate in 1988, such as central banks buying dollars to intervene in the market and the U.S. raising interest rates, "only limited but did not reverse the dollar's decline." He said that no one can accurately predict the future in today's foreign exchange market, and some fundamental economic factors will influence the future trend of the dollar's exchange rate.

Currently, the basic factors influencing the dollar's exchange rate fluctuations in the foreign exchange market are obviously those important economic indicators of the United States, especially the changes in the U.S. fiscal budget deficit and trade deficit. Market traders generally believe that until the new government led by U.S. President-elect George Bush clarifies its strategies for handling these economic issues, dollar trading will be "cautious."

In the latest "Economic and Financial Outlook" of the National Westminster Bank, economist Cohen asserts: "If the United States does not formulate a credible fiscal policy, it will seriously affect market confidence, possibly leading to a significant drop in the dollar's exchange rate, an increase in U.S. interest rates, and ultimately possibly leading to a recession in the U.S. economy." Cohen once told the reporter, "If the U.S. economy falls into a recession, no Western country will be spared." He questioned Bush's policy of "no new taxes" proposed during his presidential campaign, saying, "It is impossible to achieve the goal of reducing the U.S. budget deficit by merely cutting government spending."

Currently, there is widespread attention in the market to the basic economic factors of the United States. A report quoted a British Barclays Bank economist as saying: "Unless we see specific steps to reduce the U.S. budget deficit, (central banks of other Western countries) will stand by and do nothing when the dollar's exchange rate falls in the future." Today's and recent trading in the foreign exchange market also indicate that market traders are not enthusiastic about the dollar, and will sell dollars for profit at any opportunity.

Cohen believes that even if the United States takes effective action on the budget deficit, the dollar's exchange rate against the Japanese Yen and the West German Mark will fall to 1:110 and 1:1.60, respectively, in 1989.

### 一九八九年美元汇价趋跌

　　一九八九年美元汇价趋跌
    新华社记者  李宗扬
    今天是伦敦外汇市场１９８８年的最后一个交易日。收盘时，美元对西德马克和日元的比价分别为１∶１．７７２０和１∶１２５．２０。英镑对美元汇价升至１∶１．８０９０。
    从１９８７年１２月３１日到１９８８年１２月３０日，美元对西德马克的汇价上升了１２．９％，对日元的汇价上升了３．５％，唯有对英镑的汇价下跌了４．３％。１９８８年美元汇价坚稳的原因是：西方７个主要工业化国家中央银行的竭力干预和因美国利率上升导致的美国对西德和日本利率差的扩大，提高了美元资产的吸引力。
    但是，１９８８年并不是美元的吉年。１９８８年１月４日，美元开市不利，在东京市场一度跌到１∶１２０．２０日元和１∶１．５６１５西德马克的创纪录低点；到１９８８年１２月３０日，美元对西德马克和日元的比价仍比１９８５年９月“广场协议”时分别低３８％和４８．６％。权威人士认为，美元在１９８９年将恢复１９８５年以来的总的下降趋势。
    英国最大的清算银行——国民威斯敏斯特银行首席经济学家戴维·科恩在最近曾对新华社记者发表看法说，１９８８年的所有与美元汇价有关的行动，诸如中央银行收购美元干预市场和美国利率的提高，只是“限制了但并未扭转美元跌势”。他说，在今日外汇市场上无人可以准确预见未来的情况，一些基本经济因素将对未来美元汇价走势产生影响。
    在外汇市场上，影响美元汇价变动的基本因素目前显然是那些美国重要的经济指标，特别是美国财政预算赤字和外贸逆差指标的变动。市场商人普遍认为，在美国当选总统乔治·布什领导的新政府处理这些经济问题的对策明朗之前，美元交易将是“审慎的”。
    经济学家科恩在国民威斯敏斯特银行的最新《经济和金融展望》中断言：美国“不制定一项可信赖的财政政策将严重影响市场信心，可能导致美元（汇价）大幅度下降、美国利率的提高，最终可能导致美国经济进入衰退”。科恩曾告诉记者，“美国经济陷入衰退，西方国家无一可以幸免。”他对布什在竞选总统时提出的“没有新税”的政策主张提出疑问，说“单靠限制政府开支不可能达到削减美国预算赤字的目的”。
    目前，市场上对美国基本经济因素的关注是普遍的。一则报道援引英国巴克莱银行一位经济学家的话说：“除非我们看到削减美国预算赤字的具体步骤，（西方其他国家中央银行）将会在美元汇价未来下跌时袖手旁观。”外汇市场上今天和最近的交易也表明，市场商人对美元并不热心，一有机会，便会为赢利抛售美元。
    科恩认为，即使美国对预算赤字采取有效行动，美元对日元和西德马克的比价在１９８９年也将分别跌至１∶１１０和１∶１．６０。
