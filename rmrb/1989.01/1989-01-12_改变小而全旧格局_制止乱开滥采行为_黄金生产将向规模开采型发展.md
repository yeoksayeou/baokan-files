	Changing the Old Pattern of Small and Complete Operations and Stopping the Behavior of Random Mining
	Gold Production Will Develop Towards Large-Scale Mining

	Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 11th — Reporter Yang Yong reports: China's gold production will fully leverage regional advantages in the process of adjusting industrial structure and move towards large-scale mining. This was learned by the reporter from the national gold industry conference held today.

	In recent years, China's gold production has developed rapidly. Gold output has increased year by year, and the total amount of gold products including gold content in 1988 increased by more than 10% compared to the previous year, with new production capacity increasing by more than one fold. However, this situation, compared to the state's investment and the expected speed, and compared to the production level of major gold-producing countries in the world, still has many gaps. The current state of the gold industry restricts the rapid development of gold production. In particular, the random mining by individual gold miners in the past few years has caused great damage to the country's resources. In the future, the gold industry will, on the basis of further cleaning up and rectifying individual gold mining, formulate comprehensive and coordinated strategic goals, overcome the shortcomings of widespread but shallow mining, large mines not being fully exploited, and small mines being opened indiscriminately, and move towards large-scale mining.

	Xu Daquan, Director of the State Gold Bureau, said that the strategy of large-scale mining will be based on old mines and old bases, expanding from east to west and from north to south, achieving development from small to large and from several small areas to one large area. It is necessary to strengthen the support and management of key gold-producing provinces and large mines, focus on the production of existing gold production bases, and work hard on the establishment of gold production bases.

　　改变小而全旧格局　制止乱开滥采行为
    黄金生产将向规模开采型发展
    本报北京１月１１日讯  记者杨涌报道：我国黄金生产将在调整产业结构中充分发挥区域优势，走上规模开采的路子，这是记者从今天召开的全国黄金工作会议上获悉的。
    我国黄金生产近年发展较快。黄金产量连年递增，成品金加含量的折合量１９８８年比上年增加１０％以上，新增生产能力一倍多。但这种现状与国家投入和所期望达到的速度相比、与世界主要产金国的生产水平相比，还有不少差距。黄金行业的现状制约了黄金生产的大踏步发展。尤其是前几年个体采金者的滥采乱挖，对国家资源造成了极大破坏。今后黄金行业将在进一步清理整顿个体采金的基础上，制定综合配套战略目标，克服广采薄收，大矿不能大开，小矿盲目乱开的弊端，走规模开采的路子。
    国家黄金局局长徐大铨说，规模开采的战略，将以老矿老基地为基础，由东向西、由北向南逐步扩展，实现由小到大，由几小片到一大片的发展。要强化对重点产金大省、重点大矿的扶持和管理，重点抓好现有黄金生产基地的生产，在建立产金基地上下功夫。
