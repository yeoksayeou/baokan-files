Edition: 3

    The phenomenon where some contemporary popular terms cannot be found or where misunderstandings arise due to differing interpretations of words and phrases may soon be rectified. A comprehensive dictionary dedicated to contemporary Chinese vocabulary, titled "Language Encyclopedia," is soon to be published by Nanhai Publishing Company.

    This "Language Encyclopedia," comprising approximately 250,000 entries and 14 million characters, is about five times the size of the commonly used "Modern Chinese Dictionary." It is primarily used to look up the precise definitions and explanations of Chinese terms used in various fields from 1919 to the present. It will play a role in standardizing modern Chinese.

    The chief editor, Wang Tongyi, introduced that this large-scale Chinese dictionary is also a large-scale Chinese-English dictionary. According to the characteristic of Chinese words having multiple meanings, the dictionary collects the English equivalents for each meaning of Chinese words and explains them through definitions and examples to ensure the accurate use of standard English.

    Nearly a thousand experts, professors, writers, and artists from various fields participated in the editing of this dictionary.

　　当代汉语《语言大典》将出版
    本报讯  记者潘衍习报道：一些当代流行语词检索不到或因对用词用语的理解不一而产生歧义的现象，有望得到改观。一部专门收集当代汉语词汇的大型词典——《语言大典》即将由南海出版公司出版。
    这部约２５万条、１４００万字的《语言大典》，相当于目前常用的《现代汉语词典》的五倍，主要用于查找当代（１９１９年至今）各行各业所使用的汉语词语的准确定义和释义，将起到现代汉语规范的作用。
    《语言大典》的主编王同亿介绍说，这部大型的中文词典，也是一部大型的汉英词典。按照汉语一词多义的特点，该词典收集了各条汉语词每个义项的英文对等词，并通过释义和例句予以说明，以求准确地使用标准英语。
    各个领域的专家、教授、作家、艺术家近千人，参加了该词书的编辑工作。
