The People's Liberation Army has been reforming its training content and focusing on improving training quality, leading to a comprehensive enhancement of its defensive combat capabilities. This was reported at the recent military training business meeting held today.

The army has reformed training at four levels: individual soldiers, small units, combined tactics, and campaign tactics. The navy, air force, Second Artillery Corps, and logistics units have also made reforms according to their specific characteristics, emphasizing coordinated training within their respective branches. The navy has strengthened its fleet and long-distance training, the air force has enhanced its overall coordinated training, the Second Artillery Corps has improved its integrated training, and logistics units have bolstered their comprehensive support training.

Through these reforms, the military's training has centered on combined campaign tactics, integrating technology with tactics, individual units with the whole, and different branches into a cohesive force. This has laid the foundation for a new training system that emphasizes overall capabilities and integrated operations.

To accelerate the growth of combat readiness, the military has implemented a "train first, then supplement" system. The army, navy, air force, and Second Artillery Corps have all conducted trials of this system. New recruits undergo rigorous, systematic training at specialized institutions before being assigned to combat units. The navy has established a ship training center for classified, tiered training. The air force has set up new pilot training regiments within its aviation brigades, which have now developed into conversion training bases for both new and experienced pilots. The Second Artillery Corps has established training battalions within its missile brigades for concentrated training of new operators. The army has also set up training institutions for complex technical roles.

To improve training quality and efficiency, and to reduce the gap between training and actual combat, the military has reformed training methods and tools. New systems include a laser electronic simulation system for field combat, a computer simulation system for command training, and simulators that can replace actual equipment for training. The army, navy, air force, and Second Artillery Corps have used these systems in some units, increasing training opportunities, shortening training cycles, saving costs, and improving training quality, achieving battlefield simulation effects that were previously difficult to attain.

A responsible official from the General Staff Department's Military Training Department stated at the military training business meeting that, overall, the direction and path of the military's training reforms are correct. The military must continue to follow this path, and address any imperfections through further reforms. The current focus is to gradually promote the existing reform achievements and integrate reform efforts with implementation.

### 改革训练内容　注重训练质量  我军防卫作战能力全面提高

　　改革训练内容　注重训练质量
    我军防卫作战能力全面提高
    新华社北京１月１０日电  （记者徐京跃）记者从今天召开的全军部队训练业务会议上获悉，人民解放军各部队围绕提高部队整体作战能力，改革军事训练内容，有效地促进了全面提高我军防卫作战能力。
    陆军进行了单兵、分队、合同战术和战役训练四个层次的改革。海军、空军、第二炮兵和后勤部队，也分别结合自己的特点，突出了本军兵种和专业内的协同训练。海军的编队、远航训练，空军的整体协同训练，二炮的合成配套训练，后勤的综合保障训练，都明显加强。
    通过训练内容改革，我军训练以合同战役战术训练为中心，把技术与战术，单个与整体，兵种与合成结合起来，初步建立了注重整体、突出合成的新的内容体系。
    我军着眼于加速作战部队战斗力的成长，立足提高部队训练起点，试行了“先训后补”的训练体制。陆军、海军、空军、二炮都有计划地进行了改革试验。新兵经过专门训练机构正规、严格、系统的训练，打牢基础后，再补入作战部队。海军建立了舰艇训练中心，实行分类升级训练。空军在航空兵师内设新飞行员训练团，现在发展为改装训练基地，对新老飞行员分编分训。第二炮兵在导弹旅内设训练营，对新操作手实行集中训练。陆军一些专业复杂的技术兵也编设了训练机构。
    我军还着眼提高训练质量和效益，缩短训练与实战的距离，改革了训练方法和手段。在训练手段改革方面，研制了野外实兵对抗激光电子模拟系统，室内首长机关训练计算机模拟系统和能够代替实装进行操作训练的模拟器材。陆军、海军、空军和第二炮兵在少量部队投入使用后，增加训练机会、缩短训练周期、节约训练经费、提高训练质量，收到了过去训练难以体现的战场仿真效果。
    总参谋部军训部负责同志在全军部队训练业务会议上指出，从总体上说，我军训练改革的方向和路子是正确的，要坚定不移地按照这个路子走下去，一些不完善的地方，要通过深化改革去完善。当前工作的重心是要把已有的改革成果逐步地推广开来，把抓改革与抓落实统一起来。
