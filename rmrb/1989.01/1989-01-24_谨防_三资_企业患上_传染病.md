A responsible official from the Foreign Economic Commission of Quanzhou City, Fujian Province, recently told reporters about the management situation of "three-investment" enterprises in the city: "If 'three-investment' enterprises are to truly operate according to international norms, they must overcome the shortcomings of the current domestic enterprise management system and guard against contracting 'infectious diseases.'"

His concerns are not unfounded. Not long ago, during our visit to "three-investment" enterprises along the coast of Fujian, we discovered that some of the problems of state-owned enterprises had spread to "three-investment" enterprises.

"Nepotism and the culture of connections are rampant." A compatriot from overseas collaborated with a county in Minnan to establish a porcelain company, entrusting a village cadre to manage it. This cadre then took the opportunity to place his "aunts and uncles" in the factory. Since these people only collected salaries without working, it led to chaos in management. As a result, the company, which had been in operation for over a year, incurred a loss of 1.6 million yuan and was forced to halt production.

"Old habits die hard." In some "three-investment" enterprises that were originally state-owned enterprise workshops, when problems arose, some people habitually resorted to old methods like "iron rice bowls" and "big pot meals." The foreign general manager of a joint venture in Xiamen dismissed a worker, but the old factory's leadership, "considering the national conditions," transferred the worker back to the old factory to find another job. The office director of this company, when discussing the appointment of middle-level cadres, said: "I am not worried about being dismissed. If dismissed, I can return to the old factory and still work there." The old factory has become a "sanctuary" for protecting backwardness.

It is heartening that some "three-investment" enterprises in Fujian Province have begun to recognize the harmfulness of these "infectious diseases" and have taken preventive measures. The Sino-American joint venture Changtai County Qiaotai Plastic Factory, before the joint venture, had 180 employees, of whom 22 were off-duty managers. The workers had poor quality, lax labor discipline, and low economic efficiency. After the joint venture, the enterprise reduced the number of low-quality workers and cut the number of managers by half. It also implemented a distribution system where wages are linked to production, quality, and raw material consumption indicators, thereby motivating the workers' production enthusiasm. The enterprise's appearance has greatly improved, and the per capita output value and profit have increased by 200% and 1200% respectively compared to before the joint venture.

Some Chinese and foreign businessmen believe that learning from internationally accepted employment methods, reforming the current labor and personnel system, and formulating personnel management regulations for "three-investment" enterprises to ensure their employment autonomy is a fundamental way to prevent such "infectious diseases." They suggest that relevant departments, when formulating labor and personnel regulations, should allow "three-investment" enterprises to independently set up organizations, staffing, and personnel plans according to production and operational needs. They should also allow "three-investment" enterprises to directly recruit personnel from society and select the best candidates.

### 谨防“三资”企业患上“传染病”

　　谨防“三资”企业患上“传染病”
    福建泉州市外经委一位负责人最近向记者介绍这个市“三资”企业经营管理情况时说：“三资”企业要真正按国际惯例办事，就必须克服国内企业现行管理体制的弊端，谨防患上“传染病”。
    他的忧虑并非没有道理。前不久，我们在福建沿海地区采访“三资”企业时，就发现国营企业的一些弊病已经蔓延到了“三资”企业。
    “任人唯亲，关系学盛行”。一位华侨同闽南某县合资兴办了一家瓷器公司，委托一位村干部管理。而这个干部就趁机把自己的“七大姑八大姨”安插到厂里。由于这些人只拿工资不干活，造成管理混乱。结果，这家公司投产一年多就亏损１６０万元，被迫停产。
    “国情，新鞋，老路”。在一些由原国营企业车间组建的“三资”企业中，碰到问题，有的人便习惯于用“铁饭碗”、“大锅饭”等老一套做法去处理。厦门一家合营企业的外方总经理辞退了一名工人，老厂的领导却“从国情出发”，把这个工人调回老厂另行安排了工作。这家公司的办公室主任在向记者谈到中层干部聘任时说：“我不担心被解聘，解聘后可以回老厂照样工作。”老厂竟成了保护落后的“庇护所”。
    令人欣慰的是，福建省一些“三资”企业已开始意识到这些“传染病”的危害性并采取了防治措施。中美合资长泰县侨泰塑料厂，合资前中方是县塑料厂，全厂１８０名职工，脱产的管理人员就有２２人之多。工人素质差，劳动纪律松弛，经济效益很低。合资经营后，企业裁减了素质差的工人，将管理人员砍掉一半，并实行工资与产量、质量、原材料消耗指标挂钩的分配制度，调动了职工生产积极性，企业面貌大为改观，人均产值和利润分别比合资前提高２倍和１２倍。
    一些中外企业家认为，借鉴国际上通行的用工方式，改革现行的劳动人事制度，制定“三资”企业人事管理法规，确保“三资”企业的用工自主权，是防止这种“传染病”的一条根本途径。他们建议有关部门在制定劳动人事法规时，应允许“三资”企业根据生产经营的需要，自行设置机构、编制和用人计划。允许“三资”企业直接向社会公开招聘人员，择优使用等。
