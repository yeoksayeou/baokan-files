In the aquatic product market of Qing County, Hebei Province, buyers were surprised to find that every fish vendor had a scale with numerous holes in the pan, filtering out the water, commonly known as the "leaky-eyed scale."

Older people know that in the past, selling fish required using a scale made of iron or copper wire, known as a "soft scale." There is a saying: "Fish sellers don't carry soft scales—hook-mouthed." In recent years, for some reason, the "soft scales" disappeared, and all were replaced with pan scales. Buying a pound of fish would inevitably bring back an extra ounce or two of water.

Where did the "leaky-eyed scale" come from? This story begins with Liu Yongge. Liu Yongge is over 40 years old. At 18, he started selling vegetables in the county town, carrying a shoulder pole with two baskets and a capital of a hundred or two hundred yuan, conducting honest business. By the early 1970s, his family still lived in a thatched house made of bamboo poles. In recent years, Liu Yongge's business has thrived and expanded. In just a few years, he built six brick houses. He never forgets that this is due to the good policies of the Party and his own civilized business practices, which have won him customers. He sells vegetables often at prices lower than the market rate. One year on the 28th of December, the market price of scallions rose to 2.8 yuan per 500 grams. Liu Yongge quickly brought in a truckload of scallions from outside and announced with a megaphone: "Buy scallions! 1.4 yuan per half kilogram!" This immediately brought the price down. Some people scolded him for being "stingy," but he said, "Only a few people scold me, but thousands welcome me." "The more I do business this way, the more prosperous it becomes." Indeed, people within a ten-mile radius say, "Buy vegetables from Liu's." Over 40 restaurants are his long-term customers, and the Industrial and Commercial Bureau arranged for him to have the first stall. In addition to paying the fixed tax, every time his sales exceeded the quota, he would voluntarily go to the tax office to pay the additional tax. He often says, "Doing business can't ignore money, but it can't be all about money either."

To cut to the chase, Liu Yongge later started selling aquatic products. Most aquatic products are soaked in water, and when taken out and placed on the scale, how can they not carry water? Because of this, he was always at odds with himself: "This won't do! Such expensive fish, carrying an ounce of water would cost the customer several jiao, this is unethical!"

Last June, Liu Yongge deliberately bought 1 kilogram of freshwater fish from a fish stall, put it in a plastic bag, and took it to the Industrial and Commercial Bureau. He found Liu, the bureau chief, and said, "Look, this is 1 kilogram of fish, and it's the one I bought." He then squeezed out the water and weighed it again, and the fish weighed only about 700 grams. He loudly exclaimed, "This is outright cheating!" Liu, the bureau chief, was so angry that he stomped his foot. This issue had been investigated and rectified before, but it was never fully resolved. Liu Yongge continued, "I have an idea, use a leaky-eyed scale, and I'll be the first to use it!" Liu, the bureau chief, slapped his thigh and said, "Good! This is a great idea! Let the Industrial and Commercial Bureau take the lead and ask the Metrology Bureau to make a batch." Three days later, 18 leaky-eyed scales were made. The scale pan had 38 holes the size of a pencil, and any water on the fish would drain away.

The Industrial and Commercial Bureau distributed the leaky-eyed scales to each individual fish vendor, but initially, no one was willing to use them. Liu Yongge was the first to lead by example. After two markets, the "leaky-eyed scale" became popular.

　　“漏眼秤”的来历
    秦恩江
    在河北省青县城的水产市场，来买鱼的人新奇地发现，每个鱼贩的秤盘上都钻有密密麻麻的眼，将水滤掉，人称“漏眼秤”。
    上年岁的人知道，早时卖鱼得用铁丝或铜丝制做的“软子秤”。有句俗话：“卖鱼的不捎软子——钩嘴的”。这些年不知怎的“软子”没了，通通用盘子秤，买一斤鱼少说也要买回一二两水。
    “漏眼秤”从何而来？这得从刘永革说起。刘永革４０多岁，从１８岁就在县城卖菜，一个扁担两个筐，一二百元的本，规规矩矩的买卖人。干到７０年代初，全家人还住着竹杆搭起的土房子。这几年，刘永革的买卖做活了做大了，几年时间就盖起６间砖瓦房，他忘不了这是党的政策好，也靠他文明经营，赢得顾客。他卖菜，经常以低于市场的价格出售。有年腊月２８日，韭菜市价涨到每５００克２．８元，刘永革火速从外地调进一车韭菜，用扩音器高喊：“买韭菜！一块四半公斤！”顿时把价格给拉下来了。有人骂他“损”，他说“骂我的只是几个人，而欢迎我的是千百人”，“我这样干买卖越来越兴旺。”不错，十里八里的群众都说“买菜就买姓刘的”，有４０多家饭店是他的长期客户，工商所还把他安排在头一个摊位。他除定额税照纳外，每次超出营业额，用不着税务所过问，就主动登门增交税金。他常讲：“做买卖不能不看钱，也不能光看钱。”
    言归正传。刘永革后来经营水产品。水产品大都浸在水里，捞出来放进秤盘哪有个不带水的？为这他整天和自己过不去：“这哪行？挺贵的鱼，带一两水就狠人家好几毛，我这是缺德呀！”
    去年６月的一天，刘永革特意在一个鱼摊买了１公斤淡水鱼，装进塑料袋里，提着来到工商所，找到刘所长说：“你看着，这是１公斤鱼，还是我买的。”说着将水挤去，再用秤一称，鱼只剩下７００多克了。他大声说道：“这简直是坑人哪！”刘所长气得直跺脚。这事曾查过治过，可就是治不住。刘永革接着说：“我有个办法，改用漏眼秤，我第一个用！”刘所长一拍大腿：“好！这个主意太好啦！由工商所出面，请计量局给制一批。”三天后，１８杆漏眼秤赶制出来了。秤盘有３８个铅笔杆粗的眼，鱼放上去，有多少水也漏净了。
    工商所把漏眼秤发给每个水产个体户，开始谁愿使用？刘永革第一个带头用。没过两集，“漏眼秤”就兴开了。
