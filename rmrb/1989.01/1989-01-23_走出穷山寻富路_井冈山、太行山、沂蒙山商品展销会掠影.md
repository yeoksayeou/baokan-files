From January 12 to 20, 1989, a unique exhibition was held at the Beijing Revolutionary History Museum. All the products on display were from three famous mountains.

The five-hundred-li Jinggangshan, six-hundred-li Yimengshan, and eight-hundred-li Taihangshan are the cradles of the Chinese revolution and have long been symbols of poverty and backwardness. However, after a decade of reform and opening up, these "three mountains" have not only solved the basic problem of subsistence but have also begun to enter the stage of commodity economy.

On the second floor of the spacious exhibition hall, 39 categories and 2,225 types of products formed a splendid scene. There were hundreds of national, ministerial, and provincial-level excellent products. The once "poor and blank" mountains proudly announced to the visitors: We also have township enterprises, collective enterprises, state-owned enterprises, and even joint ventures. We can also produce famous, special, excellent, and new products.

The rich agricultural, sideline, and local specialties are the strengths of the "three mountains" and are also the hot items at the exhibition. "Comrade, do you still have any bamboo shoots?" "I'll take those black dates." The salesgirls were busy, sweating profusely, and the boxes were almost empty, but people still did not want to leave. Jinggangshan's yulan slices, winter bamboo shoots, mushrooms, wood ears; Taihangshan's jujubes, persimmons, walnuts, chestnuts; Yimengshan's "Big Gold Star" hawthorns, all of which are sour, sweet, soft, and crisp, are deeply loved by consumers. A mayor from the "three mountains" sighed, "During the time when 'grain was the key,' who could have imagined today?"

The faces of the "three mountains" people are still so simple, but their minds have been baptized by the commodity economy and have become smarter. Deeply processed series products are countless. The Taihangshan region's Zanhuang County is famous for its golden silk jujubes. In addition to fresh jujubes, it also processes them into honeyed jujubes, black jujubes, crispy jujubes, jujube paste, jujube wine, jujube vinegar, jujube powder, and jujube canned goods. One jujube gives rise to a series of township enterprises, benefiting the jujube town and also contributing to the market. Yimengshan uses the fat and large open-mouthed hawthorns as raw materials to produce special hawthorn wine and hawthorn cakes, strips, biscuits, and candies, which have been listed as key development projects by the United Nations and are very popular at this exhibition. Suichuan County in Jinggangshan uses the by-products of duck down to make various types of down jackets, down comforters, down pillows, and down sleeping bags, which are exported to many countries.

The innovation consciousness of the "three mountains" left a deep impression on people. At this exhibition, Jinggangshan's Xiajian County created the "Yaya Gourd" handicraft. Gourds symbolize good fortune and longevity. "Yaya" is a miniature variety of gourds, small and delicate, and more valuable when engraved with paintings. More than a thousand small gourds engraved with the twelve zodiac signs and the old man of longevity were quickly sold out. Taihangshan is also extraordinary. A 33-year-old farmer from Guangping County, Yan Chunde, produced the "Gardener" brand intelligence puzzle toys using a national patent, which was praised by the guests as a "little family teacher." Nine blocks have 72 variations, and 20 blocks can "pass the Hua Rong Road." It integrates six functions: picture recognition, character recognition, pinyin, English, poetry, and arithmetic, and is the first product in China's toy industry to win an international award. Seeing these ingenious and novel products, who would still say that the old revolutionary base area people are stupid and unenlightened?

The "three mountains" have changed and can no longer be underestimated. The people of the "three mountains" realize that only by going out of the mountains can the poor countryside become rich.

　　走出穷山寻富路    
    ——井冈山、太行山、沂蒙山商品展销会掠影
    本报记者  刘霄
    １９８９年１月１２日至２０日，在北京革命历史博物馆举办了一次别开生面的展销会，会上所有的商品全部出自三座著名的大山。
    五百里井冈，六百里沂蒙，八百里太行，是中国革命的摇篮，也是贫穷落后的象征。然而，改革开放１０年，“三山”不仅基本解决了温饱问题，而且开始跻身商品经济的舞台。
    二楼宽阔的展厅里，３９个大类２２２５种商品构成一幅琳琅的画面，国优、部优、省优产品达数百种之多。昔日“一穷二白”的“三山”，不无骄傲地向参观者宣布：我们也有乡镇企业、集体企业、国营企业，乃至合资企业，我们也能生产名特优新产品。
    丰富的农副土特产品是“三山”的优势，也是展销会上的抢手货。“同志，还有笋衣没有？”“那点儿黑枣我包了。”卖货姑娘忙得满头是汗，箱子已经见底了，人们仍然不肯散去。井冈山的玉兰片、冬笋、香菇、木耳；太行山的大枣、柿饼、核桃、板栗；沂蒙山的“大金星山楂”，酸、甜、面、软，都深为消费者喜爱。一位“三山”来的市长感叹道：“‘以粮为纲’的时候，哪能想到还有今天？”
    “三山人”的面庞仍然那么淳朴，“三山人”的头脑却经受了商品经济的洗礼，变得聪明起来，深加工的系列产品不胜枚举。太行山区的赞皇县盛产金丝大枣，除了鲜枣外，还加工成蜜枣、乌枣、酥枣、枣泥、枣酒、枣醋、枣面、枣罐头。一颗大枣，派生出一串乡镇企业，造福了枣乡，也为市场做了贡献。沂蒙山以肉肥个大的敞口山楂为原料，生产山楂特制酒和山楂糕、条、饼、饴，已被联合国列为重点开发项目，这次展销会上很受欢迎。井冈山的遂川县利用板鸭下脚料，制成各式各样的羽绒衣、羽绒被、羽绒枕芯、羽绒睡袋，出口到很多国家。
    “三山”的创新意识给人们留下了极为深刻的印象。这次展销会上，井冈山峡江县独创了“丫丫葫芦”工艺品。葫芦，福禄也。“丫丫”则是葫芦中的袖珍品种，小不盈握，玲珑可爱，在上面烙上字画，更增其观赏价值。上千只烙有十二生肖和老寿星的小葫芦，很快卖得一干二净。太行山也不同凡响。广平县３３岁的农民阎纯德，利用一项国家专利生产的“园丁牌”智力拼图玩具，被宾客们誉为“小小家庭教师”。９块积木具有７２变，２０块积木可走“华容道”。集识图、认字、拼音、英语、诗词、算术６种功能于一身，是我国玩具行业首次赢得国际奖牌的产品。看了这些奇巧新颖的商品，谁还能说老区人民头脑笨、不开窍呢？
    “三山”变了，再不可小觑。“三山”人认识到，只有走出大山，穷乡才会变富。
