The 83-year-old widow Bào Dēngméi (second from the right) has been paralyzed in the lower limbs for over 40 years. For decades, she has received meticulous care from the military, the neighborhood committee, and the school. In particular, the "Relay Baton" group for the protection of lonely elderly people from the Junior Pioneers of the 16th Middle School in Zhangjiakou City, Hebei Province, has provided her with nursing and companionship, making Bào Grandma's later years filled with joy. The photo shows the protection group telling stories to Bào Grandma.
