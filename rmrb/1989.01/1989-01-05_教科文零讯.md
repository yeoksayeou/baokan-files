The Cornell University Chorus arrived in Beijing on January 4 and will perform for Chinese audiences at the Beijing Concert Hall on the evening of January 6. The chorus consists of 54 students from the university and 30 alumni who are honorary members. They are well-known in the New York State area and this is their first visit to China. The performance will include American folk songs and classical songs.

An exhibition of original artwork from comic books, which are not typically considered high art but have the most readers, opened at the National Art Museum of China on January 4. The 110 pieces on display were selected from comic books and magazines published by the Chinese Comic Book Publishing House over the past three years. They represent the highest level of comic book creation, with a wide range of themes and diverse styles.

The organizing committee for stamp collecting related to film, television, sports, news, and science was recently established in Beijing. Starting this year, a major stamp collecting event will be held annually.
