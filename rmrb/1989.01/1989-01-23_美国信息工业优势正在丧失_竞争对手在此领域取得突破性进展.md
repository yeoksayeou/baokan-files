The Computer & Business Equipment Manufacturers Association of the United States recently released its annual report, which indicates that the competitive edge of the U.S. information technology industry in the international market is being lost.

The report states that in 1987, the U.S. information industry (including computers and related services, business equipment, and communication equipment) saw a 21.7% increase in exports, significantly higher than the growth rates of the previous two years. However, the trade surplus for the computer and business equipment sector was only $1.9 billion, marking the sixth consecutive year of decline and less than one-third of the record $7 billion surplus in 1981.

The report notes that despite the depreciation of the U.S. dollar, imports of computers and business equipment in 1987 increased by 26.7%, similar to the growth rate of 1986.

The report points out that these developments indicate that foreign competitors are making breakthroughs in "technology and production efficiency."

The European Community is the largest market for U.S. computer and business equipment exports. In 1987, the U.S. exported $9.2 billion worth of computers and business equipment to the Community, accounting for 43.9% of the total exports in this category. The majority of U.S. imports of computers and business equipment come from the Far East. In 1987, 78.1% of U.S. imports in this category came from Asia, with half of that amount from Japan. Imports from other Asian regions, primarily Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, and Singapore, have seen the fastest growth, increasing more than 13-fold since 1980.

In 1987, the U.S. computer and business equipment sector had a trade deficit of $10.3 billion with the Far East, while it had a surplus of $7 billion with the European Community, setting a historical record. In 1987, the U.S. communication equipment sector had a trade deficit of $2.3 billion.

　　美国信息工业优势正在丧失    
    竞争对手在此领域取得突破性进展
    据新华社华盛顿电  美国计算机和企业设备制造商协会最近发表的年度报告表明，美国信息技术产业在国际市场上的竞争优势正在丧失。
    报告说，１９８７年，美国信息产业（包括计算机及有关的服务、企业设备和通信设备）的出口增长了２１．７％，大大高于前两年的增长幅度。但是，这一年美国计算机和企业设备部门的外贸盈余只有１９亿美元，已是连续第６年出现下降，还不及１９８１年创纪录的７０亿美元外贸盈余的１／３。
    报告说，尽管美元汇价下跌，但１９８７年美国计算机和企业设备的进口增长了２６．７％，与１９８６年的增长幅度相近。
    报告指出，上述情况表明，国外的竞争对手在“技术和生产效率方面正在取得突破性进展”。
    欧洲共同体是美国计算机和企业设备出口的最大市场。１９８７年，美国向共同体出口了９２亿美元的计算机和企业设备，占该项出口总额的４３．９％。美国进口的计算机和企业设备主要来自远东。１９８７年，美国进口的计算机和企业设备中有７８．１％来自亚洲，其中一半来自日本。从亚洲其他地区——主要是台湾、香港、南朝鲜和新加坡——的进口则增长最快，自１９８０年以来增长了１３倍以上。
    １９８７年，美国计算机和企业设备部门对远东的贸易逆差为１０３亿美元，对欧洲共同体则有７０亿美元的盈余，创历史纪录。１９８７年，美国通信设备外贸逆差为２３亿美元。
