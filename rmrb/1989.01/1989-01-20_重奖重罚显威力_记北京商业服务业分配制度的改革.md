	The Power of Heavy Rewards and Heavy Penalties
	— A Record of the Reform of the Distribution System in Beijing's Commercial Service Industry
	People's Daily reporter  Zhao Xinglin

	"Having jumped out of the 'big pot' a few times, only to return to the 'pot' due to unstable footing," people used this metaphor to describe Beijing's commercial reforms in the past few years. It is precisely because of the bitter experience of repeated failures that this time, the reform decided to start from optimizing labor combinations and changing the distribution system.

	Over the past few months, what changes has it brought to the enterprises? At the beginning of the new year, the reporter visited small stores in the suburbs of Beijing and large stores in the urban areas, and the data collected was astonishing. However, there were even more astonishing changes than the data.

	The business premises remained the same, but the staff was reduced by 55 people. The Chaoyang District Shili Store Supply and Marketing Cooperative achieved a profit of over 120 million yuan from January to November last year. Compared to 1986, this was a twofold increase; in terms of ranking, it jumped from the second-to-last position to the first among the nine grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives in Chaoyang District.

	"It seems that the policy of heavy rewards and heavy penalties has taken effect," said Wang Guiliang, the director of the supply and marketing cooperative. Originally, the 18 business units under this supply and marketing cooperative began implementing the joint sales and joint profits reward policy in August last year. Those who exceeded the specified targets were rewarded; those who fell short of the targets were penalized. This put pressure on the employees: simply completing the specified targets was not enough; they had to "exceed." The production materials department, which operated fertilizers, pesticides, and agricultural films, actively purchased hardware, electrical materials, civilian construction materials, and daily necessities. The monthly sales volume increased from 3 million yuan to 90 million yuan, and the average bonus for employees in October last year increased significantly, which encouraged the employees' work enthusiasm.

	Heavy rewards and heavy penalties drove a large number of commercial enterprises. The store and Xiaohongmen Food Store of the supply and marketing cooperative, for example, competed to leverage their respective advantages, and their monthly sales volume increased severalfold. It was like picking peaches; whoever worked harder and jumped higher picked more peaches. Once everyone started jumping, how could the enterprise's benefits not go up?

	How to maintain the interests of consumers when the enterprise's benefits are linked to the personal income of employees? There is no need to worry. "Losing customers means losing competitiveness," this point forced everyone to improve service quality. The Shili Store Supply and Marketing Cooperative recently purchased a batch of substandard fruits. Fearing that selling them at a high price would affect their reputation, they quickly sold them at a price lower than the purchase price, which was well received.

	If the egalitarianism in distribution is not broken, it is unimaginable that an employee could complete 273% of the annual sales plan in just 7 months and create a profit of 18 million yuan. His name is Guo Jianhui, and he is a business employee of the Procurement and Supply Department of the Xicheng District Textile Products Company. The policy of heavy rewards and heavy penalties made him more astute, and he tried every means to provide good service. He fully utilized market information to develop business. In April and May last year, printed silk and Bali cloth were popular in the Beijing market, and he could not miss this opportunity. He promptly purchased these two types of goods from Guangdong and Liaoning and delivered them to the doorstep. Quick sales and quick turnover, just these two types of goods created a profit of over 500,000 yuan.

	Good service spirit also helped him win a batch of new customers, and his sales volume and realized profits were far ahead in the Procurement and Supply Department, with the highest bonus—290 yuan per month.

	Some people gossiped, saying, "He gets too much bonus," but Feng Fuli of the Procurement and Supply Department said, "He earns it with his abilities, I respect him, but I won't give up."

	This employee, who was once listed as an extra for three months, knew that he faced fierce competition after being reorganized. Therefore, he now works on the job not because someone is supervising him, but because he genuinely wants to work. In his first month on the job, he exceeded the profit target by over 1,000 yuan. But he was not satisfied and, by comparing his success with others, found his shortcomings. In the second month, he completed the profit target at twice the specified amount. His bonus also increased sharply.

	When bonuses are high, some people will talk; but when bonuses are not received, and wages are deducted, there are also "soft-hearted" people who intervene.

	If you don't follow the rules, you will lose the meaning of the reform and lose the support of the people. Manager Liu Yanming of the Xidan Vegetable Market insisted on following the rules. He said, "We cannot wait until everyone's psychology can bear it before implementing the distribution reform, but we must continuously improve people's bearing capacity in the reform. In August last year, the meat group completed 4.5 times the sales target. According to the regulations, each person was given a bonus of 260 yuan; one employee did not complete the quota, and according to the regulations, his monthly wage was deducted, and he had to pay an additional 8 yuan. Everyone now thinks this is reasonable!"

　　重奖重罚显威力
    ——记北京商业服务业分配制度的改革
    本报记者  赵兴林
    “从‘大锅饭’的锅里跳出几次，由于脚跟不稳而又回到了‘锅’里”，人们这样比喻北京前几年的商业改革。正是饱尝到几进几出的滋味，这次由点到面的优化劳动组合，决计从改革分配制入手。
    几个月来，它给企业带来的变迁究竟是什么呢？新年伊始，记者出京郊农村小店，入城区大型商店，采访来的数据是惊人的。然而，还有比数据还更惊人的变化。
    营业场所依旧，人员已减少５５人的朝阳区十八里店供销社，去年１至１１月实现利润１２０多万元。同１９８６年相比，翻了两番；所排名次，在朝阳区９个基层供销社中，由倒数第二跃居首位。
    “看来重奖重罚政策发挥了威力”，供销社主任王贵良说。原来这个供销社所属１８个经营单位，是从去年８月开始实行联销联利计奖政策的。超额完成规定指标者，有奖；低于规定指标者，挨罚。它给职工带来压力：只完成规定指标还不行，必须要“超”。生产资料门市部经营的化肥、农药、农膜货源紧缺，他们就主动购进五金电料、民用建筑材料及日用杂品等。月销货额由３０万元上升到９０万元，去年１０月份职工平均奖金上升较多，鼓励了职工工作热情。
    重奖重罚，带动了一大批商业企业。该供销社门市部、小红门副食店等，竞相发挥各自优势，月销货额成倍增长。好比摘桃子，谁卖力气大，跳得高，谁摘桃就多。大家都跳起来了，企业效益还愁上不去吗？
    企业效益与职工个人收入挂钩，怎样维护消费者利益？不必担心。“失去了顾客就失去了竞争力”，这一点逼着大家提高服务质量。十八里店供销社前不久购进一批质量较次的水果，怕高价出售影响信誉，赶紧低于进价甩卖出去，得到好评。
    如果不打破分配上的平均主义，难以想象一个职工能用７个月完成全年度销货计划的２７３％，创利１８万元的好成绩。他叫郭健辉，是西城区纺织品分公司采供部业务员。重奖重罚政策使他变得精明，千方百计搞好服务。他充分利用市场信息开拓业务。去年４、５月间，首都市场印花绸、巴厘纱走俏，不能坐失良机。他及时从广东、辽宁购进这两种商品，并送货上门。勤进快销，仅这两种商品的交易就创利５万多元。
    良好的服务精神，又为他争得一批新客户，销货额和实现利润在采供部遥遥领先，所得奖金也是最高的——一月２９０多元。
    有人风言风语，说“他拿奖金太多了”，可采供部冯福来却说：“人家是凭本事挣来的，我服气，但不服输。”
    这位曾被列入编外三个月的职工，深知重新被组合面临着激烈的竞争。因此，如今在岗位上干活，不再是让人督着干，而是出自内心的“我要干”。他上岗第一个月就超额完成利润指标１０００多元。但他并不满足，而是对照别人的成功经验找出自己的差距，第二个月完成的利润竟达到规定指标的２倍。他的奖金也直线上升。
    奖金拿多时，有人会说三道四；一旦拿不上奖金，被扣发工资时，也有“软心肠”的人出面讲情。
    不按规定办，就会失去改革的意义，也就失掉了民心。西单菜市场刘燕铭经理坚决照章办事。他说：“我们决不能等所有的人心理都能承受的时候再搞分配改革，而要在改革中不断提高人们的承受能力。去年８月，大肉组完成销货指标的４．５倍，按规定，人均发奖金２６０元；一名职工没完成定额，按规定，扣除当月工资，还补交８元。这些，大家已觉得理所当然！”
