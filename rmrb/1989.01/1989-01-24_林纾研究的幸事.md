The three-volume collection of Lin Shu's works, selected and annotated by Lin Wei, titled 《林纾选集》 (《小说卷》上、下，《文诗词卷》), has been published by Sichuan People's Publishing House, totaling over 800,000 words. The publication of this extensive collection of Lin Shu's works is a fortunate event for the academic and cultural circles in China.

This collection has two distinctive features. Firstly, the selector and annotator has gone through great efforts to gather materials from various sources. Not only has he compiled several unpublished important works such as 《林述庵哀辞》, but he has also collected Lin Shu's early poetry and scattered prose works from various books and journals. Moreover, he has meticulously corrected many errors made by previous scholars, such as providing a new interpretation of the "Fuzhou Three Madmen," correcting widespread errors in the widely circulated essay 《答蔡鹤卿太史书》, and resolving certain difficult points that were previously uncertain in the annotations.

Secondly, in the "Preface" of 《小说卷》 and 《文诗词卷》, as well as in the appendix 《林纾传》, the editors have provided a historical and scientific evaluation of Lin Shu's life, thoughts, and translations, reflecting their unique academic perspective. Lin Shu was a master of classical Chinese prose in modern times. His translated novels, known as "Lin Translations," were immensely popular in the late Qing and early Republican periods, opening the door for Chinese readers to Western literature. Lin Shu's contributions to modern Chinese literature are undeniable. However, during the New Culture Movement, when vernacular Chinese replaced classical Chinese, Lin Shu stood firm in the camp of classical prose, becoming a representative of conservative forces in the cultural and intellectual sphere, and was labeled as a "disgrace to the Tongcheng School."

Since the founding of the People's Republic, under the influence of literary dogmatism, there has been a tendency to completely dismiss Lin Shu.

Based on many first-hand materials, the editors have re-evaluated and reassessed Lin Shu's merits and demerits, believing that Lin Shu's excellent classical poems and prose are on par with those of Fang Bao and Yao Nai. "For over two thousand years, Chinese classical prose, which has always been at the forefront of literature, reached its pinnacle with Lin Shu." Lin Shu's early poetry boldly broke free from the constraints of traditional poetic forms, expressing his thoughts freely and criticizing social ills with a spirit of innovation. More importantly, Lin Shu is a pioneer in Chinese literary history. Lin Wei believes that the contribution of "Lin Translations" lies not only in introducing a new literary model and literary concepts that were vastly different from the old traditions but also in his prefaces and postscripts, which systematically introduced Western literary creation methods, styles, and schools for the first time. Using Western literature as a reference, he examined and reflected on traditional Chinese national psychology and culture, thus refreshing the framework of Chinese novel theory. For example, his criticism of national character, advocacy for human life, promotion of folk literature, and realistic literature, all left traces of his pioneering efforts in transforming literary concepts. Therefore, the editors regard Lin Shu's achievements in novel theory as the "source of the May Fourth New Literature."

　　林纾研究的幸事
    黄侯兴
    林薇选注的《林纾选集》（《小说卷》上、下，《文诗词卷》）三册，已由四川人民出版社出版，共８０余万字。这套卷帙浩繁的林纾作品问世，是我国学术文化界值得庆幸的一件事。
    这套选集具有两个特色。一是选注者历尽艰辛，四方搜求，不仅辑录了如《林述庵哀辞》等若干未刊的重要佚文，将湮没不彰的林纾早年诗作及其散见于书刊的词章搜辑成册；而且钩沉索隐，在考订注释方面纠正了前人的多处讹误，如对“福州三狂生”作出了新的解释，订正了流传甚广的《答蔡鹤卿太史书》一文的讹误，并解决了过去注疏中存疑的某些难点。
    其次，编者在《小说卷》、《文诗词卷》的“前言”及卷末的《林纾传》中，对林纾一生及其思想、著译作了历史科学的、富有学术个性的评价。林纾是近代古文大师。“林译小说”于清末民初，风靡一时，开启了中国人面向西方文学的道路。林纾在中国近代文学史上的地位与贡献，是不可抹煞的。然而，林纾在白话文取代文言文的新文化运动中，固守古文营垒，成为那时思想文化阵线守旧势力的代表人物，被冠以“桐城谬种”之称。建国以来，在文学教条主义影响下，对林纾有一概抹煞的倾向。
    在掌握许多第一手资料的基础上，编者对林纾的功过得失进行了再认识、再评价，认为林纾古诗文之佳作，视方苞、姚鼐洵无愧色，“两千多年来，一直居于文学正宗地位的中国古典散文，发展至于林纾，画了一个句号”。林纾早年诗作，大胆突破了旧诗格律的束缚，以自由活泼的歌谣形式，倾吐心声，鞭挞社会痼疾，锐意革新。更重要的是，林纾在文学史上是“开一代文学新风的人”。林薇认为，“林译小说”的贡献，不仅在于“第一次引进了与数千年的旧传统迥然不同的新的文学模式、文学观念”，而且在其序跋中“最早地、比较系统地介绍了西方文学的创作方法、风格和流派等，第一次用西方文学作为参照系，对于中国传统的民族心理、民族文化进行了审视反思，从而刷新了中国小说理论的格局”。如对于国民性的批判，张扬为人生，鼓吹平民文学、写实文学等，都留下拓荒者文学观念蜕旧变新的辙痕。所以编者把林纾小说理论的建树，视为“‘五四’新文学之滥觞”。
