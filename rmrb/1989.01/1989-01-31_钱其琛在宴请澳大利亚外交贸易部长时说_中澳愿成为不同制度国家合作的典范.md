Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said today that China and Australia are both willing to develop their bilateral relations into a model of cooperation between countries with different social systems.

Qian Qichen made the remarks at a luncheon held in honor of Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade Gareth Evans and his delegation. He said that in recent years, Sino-Australian relations have developed rapidly and comprehensively.

The Australian delegation arrived in Beijing yesterday afternoon at the invitation of Qian Qichen and began a four-day visit to China.

In his toast, Qian Qichen also said that China and Australia share similar or close views on many major international issues and coordinate, cooperate, and support each other in international affairs and international organizations.

He said, "The political common ground and economic complementarity determine that the friendly cooperative relations between China and Australia have great potential and a broad prospect."

Evans, in his reply, said that in recent years, the economic relations between the two countries have reached a new height. The economic reforms of both countries have benefited both sides in their cooperation.

He said, "The rapid and positive development of bilateral relations shows that two countries with vastly different political and economic systems can successfully complement each other and achieve common interests."

Evans stressed that the Australia-China relationship is a cornerstone of Australia's foreign policy and trade policy.

When talking about the international situation, Qian Qichen pointed out that peace and development are the two major themes of the contemporary world. The prospect of peace is bright, and the world may enter a new period conducive to maintaining peace and promoting development. However, the development issue has not been resolved, and the economic gap between the South and the North is widening.

Evans said, "In stark contrast to the improving international political environment, the outlook for the world trade system is far from satisfactory." He pointed out that establishing a more just and free international trade system is crucial to consolidating and safeguarding the positive trends in the current international political arena.

In the morning, the two foreign ministers held a two-hour talk, during which they exchanged in-depth views on major international issues and bilateral relations.

Both sides agreed that the Cambodian issue should be resolved as soon as possible in a fair and reasonable manner, and that neighboring countries should establish friendly and neighborly relations. They also expressed the hope that the situation on the Korean Peninsula would further ease.

Qian Qichen thanked Australia for its support for China's position at the mid-term review meeting of the Uruguay Round in Montreal.

Evans, on behalf of the Australian government, expressed condolences over the unfortunate passing of Panchen Erdeni Qigjab Zhamcar, who had led a delegation to visit Australia.

　　钱其琛在宴请澳大利亚外交贸易部长时说    
    中澳愿成为不同制度国家合作的典范
    新华社北京１月３０日电  中国外交部长钱其琛今天说，中国和澳大利亚都愿意把两国关系“发展成为不同社会制度国家相互合作的典范”。
    钱其琛今天中午在欢迎澳大利亚外交贸易部长加里思·埃文斯一行的宴会上致词时说，近年来中澳关系得到了迅速、全面的发展。
    埃文斯一行应钱其琛的邀请于昨天下午抵京，开始对中国进行为期４天的访问。
    钱其琛在祝酒辞中还说，中澳两国在许多重大国际问题上有着相同或近似的看法，在国际事务和国际组织中相互协调、配合和支持。
    他说，“政治上的共同点和经济上的互补性，决定了中澳友好合作关系有着巨大的潜力和广阔的前景。”
    埃文斯在致答辞中说，近年来，中澳经济关系达到了新的高度。两国的经济改革使双方在合作中获得益处。
    他说，两国关系迅速、积极的发展表明，两个政治、经济制度迥然不同的国家可以成功地互相补充，实现共同的利益。
    埃文斯强调，澳中关系是澳大利亚外交政策和贸易政策的一块基石。
    在谈到国际形势时，钱其琛指出，和平和发展是当代的两大主题。和平的前景是光明的，世界有可能进入一个有利于维护和平和促进发展的新时期。但发展问题还未解决，南北经济差距越来越大。
    埃文斯说，“与正在改善的国际政治环境形成鲜明对照，世界贸易体系的前景远不如人意。”他指出，建立一个更为公正、自由的国际贸易体系对巩固和保障当前国际政治领域中的积极趋势至关重要。
    上午，两位外长进行了两个多小时的会谈，双方就当前重大国际问题和双边关系深入地交换了意见。
    双方一致主张，柬埔寨问题应尽快得到公正合理的政治解决；各邻国之间应建立睦邻友好关系。他们还表示希望，朝鲜半岛局势能得到进一步缓和。
    钱其琛感谢澳大利亚在乌拉圭回合蒙特利尔部长级中期审评会议上对中国立场的支持。
    埃文斯代表澳大利亚政府对曾率团访问过澳大利亚的中国全国人大常委会副委员长班禅额尔德尼·确吉坚赞的不幸逝世表示哀悼。
