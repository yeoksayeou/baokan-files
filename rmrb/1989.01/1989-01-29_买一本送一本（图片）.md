    Buy One, Get One Free (January 5, Liberation Daily, by Pan Shunqi)

    The promotion "Buy One, Get One Free" has been widely adopted by many bookstores. This practice has been criticized by some people, and it has also received support from others. In my opinion, this promotion is a good thing. It can stimulate the reading enthusiasm of the people, and it can also promote the development of the book industry.

    First, the promotion "Buy One, Get One Free" can stimulate the reading enthusiasm of the people. In recent years, the reading level of the people has been improving, but there are still many people who do not have the habit of reading. This promotion can attract more people to buy books, and it can also encourage people to read more. This is beneficial to the improvement of the people's cultural level.

    Second, the promotion "Buy One, Get One Free" can promote the development of the book industry. The book industry is an important part of the cultural industry. The development of the book industry can promote the development of the cultural industry, and it can also promote the development of the national economy. This promotion can increase the sales volume of books, and it can also increase the profits of bookstores. This is beneficial to the development of the book industry.

    In conclusion, the promotion "Buy One, Get One Free" is a good thing. It can stimulate the reading enthusiasm of the people, and it can also promote the development of the book industry. Therefore, we should support this promotion.
