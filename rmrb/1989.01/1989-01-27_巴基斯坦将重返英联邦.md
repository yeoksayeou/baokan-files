Pakistan to Rejoin the Commonwealth

	Istanbul, January 26 (Reported by Ren Yujun) On January 24, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto revealed to the press in Karachi that the People's Party government has put the issue of rejoining the Commonwealth on the agenda. This move is part of the broad-based diplomatic strategy that the Benazir Bhutto government has been actively pursuing since taking office.

	Pakistan gained independence from British colonial rule in 1947 and joined the Commonwealth. It remained a member until 1972, when the former East Pakistan declared independence and established the People's Republic of Bangladesh. Britain and several Commonwealth member states subsequently recognized Bangladesh. At the time, the Pakistani government accused India of "disintegrating Pakistan" and strongly protested the recognition of Bangladesh by Commonwealth nations, leading to its withdrawal from the Commonwealth.

	Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto stated that Pakistan had recognized Bangladesh in 1974, and formal diplomatic relations were established in 1975. She estimated that most Commonwealth countries would welcome and support Pakistan's return. A few years ago, India had expressed opposition to Pakistan's re-admission to the Commonwealth.

　　巴基斯坦将重返英联邦
    本报伊斯兰堡１月２６日电  记者任毓骏报道：１月２４日，贝·布托总理在卡拉奇向新闻界透露，人民党政府已把重新加入英联邦问题纳入议事日程。这一动向，是贝·布托政府执政后积极开展“基础广泛的外交策略”的组成部分。
    巴基斯坦在１９４７年由英国的殖民地成为独立国家并加入英联邦，此后一直是其成员国。１９７２年，原来的东巴基斯坦宣告独立，成立了孟加拉人民共和国。英国以及一些英联邦成员国相继承认了孟加拉国。当时，巴基斯坦政府指责印度“肢解巴基斯坦”并强烈抗议英联邦国家承认孟加拉国，因而宣布退出英联邦。
    贝·布托总理这次表示，巴基斯坦已于１９７４年承认了孟加拉国，１９７５年两国正式建交。她估计大多数英联邦国家将对巴基斯坦的态度表示欢迎和支持。前几年，印度曾表示反对英联邦重新接纳巴基斯坦。
