	Focusing on the future unified market, the European Community is implementing a foreign language teaching plan.

	Xinhua News Agency, Brussels: On December 21, 1988, the European Community Commission proposed a five-year strategic language teaching plan. The goal is to improve the ability of citizens in member countries to use foreign languages in anticipation of the future unified market.

	The Commission stated that the Community currently has 12 member countries, each with different languages. To establish an internal market by 1992, language barriers must be overcome. The Commission said that the focus of this plan should be on implementing multilingual education rather than just popularizing one or two major languages. In other words, all official languages within the Community should be learned by someone.

	This plan, which will start in 1990 and cost 2.5 billion European Currency Units (1 European Currency Unit equals 1.17 US dollars), includes promoting language training for young people, strengthening the existing university education network, and developing initial training for language learners. It also aims to promote language education in economic life and improve reforms in foreign language education.

　　着眼于未来统一大市场
    欧共体推行外语教学计划
    新华社布鲁塞尔电  欧洲共同体委员会１９８８年１２月２１日提出了一项为期５年的战略性语言教学计划。其目的是，着眼于未来的统一大市场，提高共同体各国公民使用外语的能力。
    委员会说，共同体现有１２个成员国，各国所使用的语言不同。要在１９９２年建成内部大市场，就应当克服语言障碍。委员会说，这项计划的重点应当是实行多种语言教学，而不是只普及一、两种主要语言，也就是说，共同体内的所有正式语言都要有人学。
    这项从１９９０年开始，耗资２．５亿欧洲货币单位（１欧洲货币单位等于１．１７美元）的计划包括促进对年青人的语言训练，加强现有的大学教育网，并发展对学语言的学生的初级训练，促进经济生活中的语言教育和促进改善外语教育的改革等。
