The U.S. Department of Agriculture released a report today stating that due to the severe impact of drought, the country's grain production last year is estimated to have decreased by 26% compared to 1987, slightly lower than the previously estimated 29%.

According to the final report on the impact of the drought on U.S. agriculture, the total grain production in 1988 was estimated to be 2.039 billion metric tons.

The report estimates that the production of wheat, corn, soybeans, sorghum, oats, and barley in the U.S. last year all saw significant decreases compared to 1987. However, the production of rice, cotton, tobacco, and peanuts exceeded that of 1987.

The report states that although the drought last year resulted in a $13 billion reduction in agricultural income, its impact on the overall economy was "relatively small." The drought caused U.S. food prices to rise by about half a percentage point last year, and it is expected to have a similar impact this year.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture also announced today that the country's current grain reserves are significantly lower than they were a year ago. Specifically, corn reserves have decreased by 27%, soybean reserves by 22%, and wheat reserves by 32%.

To expand agricultural production this year, the U.S. government is encouraging farmers to increase the area of land used for crops. It is estimated that U.S. farmers will increase the area of land used for crops by more than 25 million hectares this year. The area of land used for winter wheat has increased by 12% compared to 1988, reaching 54.5 million hectares, the highest in four years.

　　美国去年农业严重减产
    谷物产量比上年减少２６％
    新华社华盛顿１月１３日电 美国农业部今天公布的一份报告说，由于受干旱的严重影响，去年美国的谷物产量估计比１９８７年减少２６％，减产幅度低于原先估计的２９％。
    据这份有关旱灾对美国农业影响的最后报告提供的估计数字，１９８８年美国谷物总产量为２．０３９亿吨。
    报告估计，去年美国的小麦、玉米、大豆、高粱、燕麦和大麦的产量均比１９８７年大幅度减少，但大米、棉花、烟草和花生的产量仍超过１９８７年。
    报告说，尽管去年的干旱使农业部门减少了１３０亿美元的收入，但对整个经济的影响“较小”。干旱使美国去年的食品价格多上升半个百分点，预计对今年影响与去年差不多。
    农业部今天还宣布，目前美国的谷物储备大大低于１年前的水平，其中玉米的储备下降了２７％，大豆的储备下降了２２％，小麦的储备下降了３２％。
    为了扩大今年的农业生产，美国政府鼓励农场主们增加作物种植面积。据估计，今年美国农场主们将增加２５００多万公顷作物种植面积。冬小麦的种植面积比１９８８年增加了１２％，达５４５０万公顷，为４年来种植冬小麦最多的一年。
