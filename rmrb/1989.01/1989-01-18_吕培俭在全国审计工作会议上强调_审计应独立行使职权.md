Auditor-General Lü Peijian recently emphasized at the national auditing work conference held in Beijing that auditing supervision is different from the supervisory functions of financial and economic management departments. According to the Constitution and the Audit Regulations, various levels of auditing agencies, under the direct leadership of the Premier, Governors, Mayors, and County Magistrates, independently conduct auditing supervision of financial and fiscal receipts and expenditures and related economic activities in accordance with the law, without interference from other administrative agencies, social organizations, or individuals.

Lü Peijian said that in the future, the main objects of auditing supervision of financial and fiscal receipts and expenditures will be the various departments of the government at the same level and the government at the next lower level, departments managing fiscal and credit funds, key enterprises and institutions, and key construction projects. This year, the focus of auditing supervision should be on the prominent issues in the management and use of fiscal and credit funds, to promote the strengthening of macro-control and management of funds.

Lü Peijian pointed out that currently, some places are arbitrarily reducing or exempting taxes, withholding revenues, falsely listing expenditures, and creating fake deficits, which are phenomena that violate financial discipline and disperse financial resources. These issues are quite common and some are quite serious. It is necessary to strengthen the auditing of local financial receipts and expenditures, with the focus on places with more remitted revenues and more state subsidies, conducting audits from top to bottom and level by level. The auditing of local finances should gradually transition to regular auditing.

In discussing the auditing of the financial receipts and expenditures of financial institutions and credit funds, Lü Peijian said that the auditing of credit funds of the People's Bank and specialized banks should mainly focus on whether there are violations of state regulations in the issuance of loans, the arbitrary use of credit funds for construction within the system, violations of regulations in operating trust companies for credit business, and whether financial receipts and expenditures are in accordance with state regulations. This is to promote the rectification of financial order and strengthen credit management.

　　吕培俭在全国审计工作会议上强调
    审计应独立行使职权
    本报讯  记者王锦鹄报道：审计长吕培俭近日在北京召开的全国审计工作会议上强调，审计监督不同于财政经济管理部门的监督职能，根据《宪法》和《审计条例》的规定，各级审计机关在总理、省长、市长、县长的直接领导下，依法对财政财务收支及有关的经济活动独立进行审计监督，不受其它行政机关、社会团体和个人的干涉。
    吕培俭说，今后审计监督财政财务收支的主要对象，是本级政府各部门和下一级政府、管理财政、信贷资金的部门、重点企事业单位和重点基建项目。今年要把财政、信贷资金管理和使用中的突出问题，作为审计监督的重点，促进加强资金的宏观控制和管理。
    吕培俭指出，当前，有些地方越权减免税收，截留收入，虚列支出，搞假赤字等违反财经纪律、分散财力的现象比较普遍，有的相当严重，必须加强对地方财政收支的审计，审计的重点放在上交收入多和国家补贴多的地方，由上而下、逐级进行。对地方财政应逐步转入经常性审计。
    在谈到开展对金融机构财务收支及信贷资金的审计时，吕培俭说，对人民银行和专业银行的信贷资金审计，主要审计有无违反国家规定发放贷款、擅自动用信贷资金搞本系统基建、违反规定自办信托公司经营信贷业务以及财务收支是否执行国家规定等，以促进整顿金融秩序，加强信贷管理。
