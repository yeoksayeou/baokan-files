The Yingying Pagoda in the Pujue Temple of Yongji County, Shanxi Province, exhibits nine unique acoustic effects. Inside and around the pagoda, different sounds such as frog croaks, drum beats, and fox cries can be heard. These acoustic mysteries have been unraveled by Chinese scientists.

This research was led by Ding Shizhang, an associate professor at the Physics Department of Shanxi University, with participation from Zhou Benqing and Zhang Yinyong, also associate professors at Shanxi University, Yu Wenhua, a professor at the Physics Department of Heilongjiang University, Xu Junhua, the director and deputy researcher of the Acoustics Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Wu Shouqian, a professor at the Physics Department of Xi'an Jiaotong University.

The National Natural Science Foundation of China's Mathematics and Physics Department evaluated this research as having significant importance in uncovering China's scientific and cultural heritage and in conducting research on the history of science.

The Yingying Pagoda, originally named the Relic Pagoda, was first built during the Tang Dynasty under Empress Wu Zetian. The pagoda is square-shaped, hollow, and seven stories high. Later, due to the love story of Zhang and Yingying described by Wang Shifu in "The Story of the Western Wing" during the Yuan Dynasty, people began to call it the Yingying Pagoda. The original pagoda was destroyed in the 1556 Yuncheng earthquake during the reign of Jiajing in the Ming Dynasty. Eight years later, it was reconstructed according to the original structure, but the height was increased to 13 stories, reaching 50 meters.

The Yingying Pagoda is known for its frog sounds, which were initially thought to be echoes from the valley. The earliest textual record of this phenomenon appears in the "Puzhou Prefecture Records" from the Qianlong era of the Qing Dynasty. Since 1986, Ding Shizhang and his team have conducted eight investigations into this phenomenon, discovering that the Yingying Pagoda not only produces frog sounds but also exhibits other acoustic effects. These effects include:

- People striking stones or clapping hands 10 or 20 meters away from the pagoda can hear frog croaks transmitted from the brick pagoda.
- When a performance is held on the stage in Pucheng Town, 2.5 kilometers away, people on the steps at the base of the pagoda can hear drum beats from inside the pagoda.
- People whispering near the pagoda can be clearly heard 40 meters away.
- When someone speaks on the ninth floor of the pagoda, the sound heard below seems to come from the first floor. Speaking on the fifth floor makes it sound like people are speaking on both the first and ninth floors.

They recorded and analyzed the frequency spectrum of some of these acoustic effects, finding that the causes of the Yingying Pagoda's acoustic phenomena are complex. Generally, there are three main factors:

1. Unique topography and terrain: The Yingying Pagoda is situated on higher ground, with a flat and unobstructed surrounding area, allowing it to receive sound waves from a wide range.
2. Unique architectural structure: Each layer of the pagoda's eaves extends outward in an inward-curving arc, reflecting and concentrating sounds. The "frog sounds" are the result of reflections from the 13 layers of eaves. Below the first layer, there is a constricted opening that reflects sounds back and forth, creating a resonant source.
3. Unique building materials: The entire pagoda and its eaves are constructed from smooth, green bricks, which reflect and resonate with sound waves.

　　莺莺塔内有奇声　其中奥妙已揭开
    特殊地形与建筑形成九种声学效应
    新华社太原１月２日电  （记者池茂花、惠金义）山西永济县普救寺内莺莺塔有９种奇妙的声学效应，在塔内和周围不同位置可以听到塔内传出的蛙声、锣鼓声、狐狸叫声等声音。这些声学奥妙已由我国科学家揭开。
    这一科研工作由山西大学物理系副教授丁士章主持，参加的有山西大学物理系副教授周本青、张荫榕，黑龙江大学物理系教授俞文光，中国科学院声学研究室主任、副研究员徐俊华，西安交通大学物理系教授吴寿锽等人。
    国家自然科学基金委员会数学物理学部评价这项研究对发掘我国科学文化遗产，开展科学史的研究有重要意义。
    莺莺塔，原名舍利塔，最早建于唐朝武则天时期，塔为方形，中空，高七层。后因元代王实甫在《西厢记》里描写的张生与莺莺的爱情故事发生在这里，人们称它为莺莺塔。原塔毁于明嘉靖３４年（公元１５５６年）运城大地震，８年后又按原来的结构特点修复，但高度增至１３层，高５０米。
    莺莺塔有蛙声，初时人们认为是山谷回声，文字记载最早出现在清代乾隆年间的《蒲州府志》。从１９８６年起，丁士章等人先后８次来到这里对这种现象进行考查，发现莺莺塔不仅有蛙声，还有其他声学效应。这些声学效应主要有：人们在离塔１０米或２０米处击石、拍手，可以听到由砖塔传来的蛙鸣声；当２．５公里外的蒲州镇戏台演戏时，人们在塔底台阶上能听到塔里有锣鼓声；人们在塔旁小声说话，距塔４０米处能清晰地听见；人在塔的９层上讲话，下面听声音像是从一层传来，在五层说话则好像一层和九层都有人说话。
    他们对部分声学效应进行了录音测试，并做了频谱分析，发现莺莺塔产生声学效应的原因复杂，概略地说主要有三个方面：一、特殊的地形地貌。莺莺塔所处的地势较高，而四周平缓又无障碍物，可以接受大范围内传来的声波。二、特殊的建筑构造。每一层塔檐挑出成内凹弧形，能把声音反射汇聚，“蛙声”就是１３个塔檐反射的结果。塔内一层下面有个收缩的口子，能把塔内发出的声音来回反射，形成共振源。三、特殊的建筑材料，塔身和塔檐全部用青砖叠砌而成，表面光滑，对声波有反射和谐振作用。
