As the new year begins, the East China University of Chemical Technology has approved a comprehensive reform plan, clearly stating that the next step in reform is to build the school into a mentally healthy small society. The goal is to optimize the educational environment and cultivate talents suitable for the needs of the "four modernizations."

The comprehensive reform plan is based on a summary of the experiences from the past three years of reform. On October 18 of last year, Li Tieying, the Minister of the State Education Commission, listened to a report from Chen Minheng, the President of the University, on the reform ideas. He affirmed the achievements of the reform and hoped that the university could formulate a new comprehensive reform plan.

The new reform focuses on the reorganization and construction of the faculty and staff. To build the school into a vibrant and spirited (rather than a society full of complaints and grievances) small society, the key is to make the faculty and staff understand socialism in their thoughts and adapt to the commodity economy in their psychology. To this end, the school will carry out systematic learning and ideological construction. It is believed that after several years of reform practice, the faculty and staff of the Chemical Technology University have a relatively strong psychological endurance, but it is still not enough. They should not passively endure various shocks and pressures, but should take the initiative to actively participate in the reform, do a good job in teaching, managing, and serving the students, and become successful and victorious in the new reform and competition.

The Chemical Technology University has done a lot of work in creating a good learning and living environment for students. At the same time, it has taken effective measures to strictly manage and require students, and the academic atmosphere has significantly improved. Now, when students go out into society, there are naturally problems with their professional knowledge and business skills not being up to par, but more seriously, they are not psychologically and ideologically adapted to the socialist primary stage of society.

To this end, the school will take major steps in education reform. Undergraduate education will be implemented in two stages: the first and second years will be basic education, and the third and fourth years will be professional education. In the first two years, students will be trained in categories, managed by the newly established Basic Education College. In the latter two years, they will be divided into various departments and majors for study. The basic education stage will include the training of ideological and psychological qualities, which will be integrated throughout the process. The teachers of the Basic Education College will be carefully selected and trained. Professional education will focus on employment, paying attention to the training of vocational ideals, vocational ethics, and vocational habits. It will cultivate students' ability to solve problems with knowledge. In the latter part of the third year, students can find jobs and pre-distribute, and in the fourth year, they can choose their majors. The professional discipline groups and research institutes will all become educational entities that can accept a certain number of graduate students and fourth-year undergraduates.

In terms of scientific and technological services, efforts will be made to develop school-run enterprises to establish school industries and raise funds for running schools through multiple channels. The school-run enterprises will pay taxes to the school, and the department-run enterprises will pay taxes to the departments.

This comprehensive reform plan was approved at the third session of the second term of the school's faculty and staff representative conference on January 6. Before that, a survey of the school's faculty and staff was conducted, with more than 80% expressing agreement or basic agreement.

　　优化育人环境　培养合格人才
    华东化工学院按新思路深化改革 
    目标是把学校建设成心智健康的小社会
    本报上海１月９日电  记者萧关根报道：新年伊始，华东化工学院通过了综合改革方案，明确提出下一步的改革目标是：把学校建设成一个心智健康的小社会，优化育人环境，培养适合“四化”建设需要的合格人才。
    综合改革方案是在总结前三年改革经验的基础上提出来的。去年１０月１８日，国家教委主任李铁映听取了陈敏恒院长关于改革思路的汇报后，肯定了改革成绩，并希望该校能制订新的综合改革方案。
    新的改革重点是教职工队伍的重组和建设，因为要把学校建成朝气蓬勃、精神振奋（不是牢骚满腹、怨天尤人）的小社会，关键是要使教职工在思想上理解社会主义，在心理上适应商品经济。为此，学校将开展系统的学习和思想建设。大家认为，经过几年的改革实践，化工学院教职工的心理承受能力是比较强的，但还不够，不能满足于消极地承受各种冲击和压力，而要主动进取，积极投身改革，做好教书育人、管理育人、服务育人的工作，在新的改革和竞争中成为成功者和胜利者。
    化工学院在为学生创造良好的学习、生活环境方面做了大量的工作，同时还采取有力措施对学生实行严格要求和管理，学风有了明显好转。现在的学生走向社会后，自然有专业知识和业务能力不适应的问题，但更为严重的是心理上、思想上不适应社会主义初级阶段的社会环境。
    为此，该校将在教育方面采取大的改革步骤，本科生实行两段式教育：一、二年级为基础教育，三、四年级为专业教育；前两年学生分类培养，由新成立的基础教育学院负责，后两年分流到各系和专业学习；基础教育阶段将思想心理素质的训练列入计划，贯穿于全过程。基础教育学院的教师要精心挑选并经过培训。专业教育以就业为背景，注意职业理想、职业道德、职业习惯的训练。培养学生运用知识解决问题的能力。三年级后期，学生可以自找职业和进行预分配，四年级选择专业，专业学科组和研究所都要成为能接纳约定数量研究生和四年级本科生的教育实体。
    在科技服务方面，要大力开展校办企业的工作，以建立学校产业，多渠道筹集办学资金。院办企业向院部纳税，系办企业向系纳税。
    这个综合改革方案１月６日在该校教代会二届三次会议上通过。这以前，还向学校教职工做过意向调查，８０％以上的人表示同意或基本同意。
