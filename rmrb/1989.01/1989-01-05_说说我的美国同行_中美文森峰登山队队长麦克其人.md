Talking About My American Colleague
— The Leader of the Sino-American Vinson Massif Expedition, McK

Mr. McK, an American, in the icy world of the Antarctic, after learning about his independent and legendary life, I thought, I must write about our American leader in the Sino-American joint mountaineering team.

When he was only 10 years old, he was once fascinated by windsurfing. Every day after school, he delivered newspapers door to door, finally saving enough money to buy a windsurfing board. "I was driving the windsurfing board, enjoying the feeling of sailing against the wind, but I was even happier to enjoy the fruits of my own labor."

After turning 20, McK's interest shifted to exploration. He had been a diving guide and a hang gliding instructor, but he loved mountaineering the most. He has gone to the North Pole eight times, making him the person who has been to the North Pole the most times in the world. He has been to the South Pole 15 times and is the only person in the world to have conquered Vinson Massif twice. His footsteps have covered 132 countries and regions, and among the highest peaks of the seven continents, he has yet to climb Everest.

When talking about Everest, he excitedly said: "In 1989, I will go to climb Everest. If I succeed, I will be the first person in the world to not only conquer the highest peaks of the seven continents but also the North and South Poles."

The 39-year-old McK, in his nearly 20 years of exploration, deeply understands the joys and hardships of exploration. This Sino-American joint mountaineering team was established at his initiative.

In choosing between exploration and his wife, he painfully chose the former. High-altitude exploration is a very expensive activity. This time, climbing Vinson Massif, McK spent more than $20,000, but when I discovered that the few pairs of socks he wore were full of holes, I couldn't help but sigh.

　　说说我的美国同行
    ——中美文森峰登山队队长麦克其人
    麦克先生，美国人，在南极冰雪世界中，得知他崇尚独立、富于传奇色彩的身世后，我想，一定要写写我们这个中美联合登山队的美国队长。
    他还只有１０岁时，曾迷恋过帆板运动。每天放学后挨家挨户送报纸，终于攒足了买一个帆板的钱。“我驾驶着帆板，为体会乘风破浪的滋味而高兴，但我更高兴的是享受自己的劳动成果。”
    ２０岁以后，麦克的兴趣转向探险，他当过潜水向导，当过三角翼滑翔教练，但最喜欢的还是登山。他八次赴北极，是世界上去北极次数最多的人，南极他去过１５次，并且是世上唯一两次征服文森峰的人。他的足迹已遍布１３２个国家和地区，七大洲的最高峰中，他只有珠峰还没有登过。
    提起珠峰，他激动地说：“１９８９年，我要去登珠峰，如果能成功，我就将成为世上第一个不但征服七大洲最高峰，并且征服南北极的人。”
    今年３９岁的麦克在近２０年的探险生涯中深知探险的乐趣与艰难。这次中美联合登山队，就是在他的发起下组建的。
    在探险与妻子之间，他忍痛选择了前者。高山探险是一项消费很大的活动，这次登文森峰，麦克拿出了２万多美元，但我发现他穿的几双袜子居然百孔千疮时，不禁感慨不已。
