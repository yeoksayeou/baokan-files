From the second half of last year, the energy-tight situation in our country has not only not eased, but has instead intensified. Currently, there is a shortage of coal, oil, and electricity nationwide. Many factories are operating at reduced capacity, and cities and rural areas frequently experience power outages and restrictions, seriously affecting economic development and people's lives. How to get out of this predicament? Huang Yiqing, the Minister of the Energy Department, said at the national energy work conference held today: The key lies in ensuring power supply. Only by resolutely ensuring the power supply can we secure the overall situation.

It is understood that last year's coal production has been completed according to the plan, with a raw coal output of 9.6 billion tons, an increase of 3250 million tons compared to 1987. Although the railway department has made great efforts under the condition of extremely tight transportation capacity, the coal delivery rate for planned power use in the four major power grids nationwide is only 92.6%, and the East China Power Grid is only 86%. The cumulative shortfall in coal supply for power use is about 800 million tons. The main reason for the coal shortage at power plants is that non-planned coal use has occupied planned coal use. In October last year, at the dispatch meeting held by the State Planning Commission, it was decided that the winter reserve of coal for power use nationwide should not be less than 600 million tons. However, in reality, the current coal inventory for power use is less than 400 million tons. Many power plants continue to see a decline in coal storage, issuing urgent notices, and many generating units are shutting down due to coal shortages. Currently, 2 million kilowatts of generating units in the East China Power Grid have stopped operating.

    缓解能源紧张关键在于保电
    本报北京１月２０日讯  记者刘燮阳报道：从去年下半年以来，我国能源紧张的局面不仅没有缓和，反而有所加剧。现在全国到处缺煤、缺油、缺电，许多工厂停三开四，城乡频繁拉闸限电，严重影响了经济发展和人民生活。如何摆脱这种困境？能源部部长黄毅诚在今天召开的全国能源工作会议上说：关键在于保电，只有决心保住电，才能保住全局。
    据了解，去年煤炭生产已按计划完成，原煤产量达到９．６亿吨，比１９８７年增产３２５０万吨；尽管铁路部门在运力十分紧张的情况下，尽了很大的努力，但是，全国四大电网计划内电力用煤到货率只有９２．６％，华东电网只有８６％，累计欠供电力用煤约８００多万吨。造成电厂缺煤的原因，主要是计划外用煤挤占了计划内用煤。去年１０月，在国家计委召开的调度会上曾经确定，全国电力用煤冬储量不低于６００万吨，而实际上，目前电力用煤库存不到４００万吨，许多电厂存煤继续下降，纷纷告急，不少发电机组缺煤停机，目前，华东电网的２００万千瓦机组已停工。
