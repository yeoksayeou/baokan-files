The end of the year and the beginning of the new year have seen frequent meetings in China's scientific community to discuss the issue of "disaster reduction." Chinese scientists are actively preparing for the upcoming "International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction."

Since last December, scientists from the State Science and Technology Commission, the State Education Commission, as well as departments of geology, forestry, aerospace remote sensing, environmental protection, marine sciences, and seismology have held multiple interdisciplinary conferences. They have exchanged findings in the study of natural disasters and discussed issues related to the prediction, monitoring, and assessment of major natural disasters. Scientists are calling for strengthened cooperation in this research field to reduce disaster losses through scientific methods. China's disaster reduction research is also a response to international disaster reduction activities. The 42nd United Nations General Assembly has passed a resolution, naming the last decade of the 20th century, starting from 1990, as the "International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction."

　　为一项国际活动作准备
　　科学界积极研究减灾
    本报北京１月１７日讯  记者钱江报道：年末岁首，我国科学界频频会议，商讨“减灾”问题，中国科学家正在为即将到来的“国际减轻自然灾害１０年”进行积极准备。
    去年１２月以来，国家科委、教委，以及地质、林业、航天遥测、环境保护、海洋、地震等部门的科学家连续举行多学科会议，交流在自然灾害研究方面的成果，商讨对重大自然灾害的预报、监测和灾情评估等问题。科学家们呼吁加强在这一研究领域的合作，通过科学的方法减少灾害损失。中国科学家们进行的减灾研究也是对国际减灾活动的响应。第４２届联合国大会已通过决议，把从１９９０年开始的２０世纪的最后１０年定名为“国际减轻自然灾害１０年”。
