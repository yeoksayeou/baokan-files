	Strengthening Technical Upgrades and Building Raw Material Bases: Jilin Paper Mill Focuses on Future Development

	According to a report from our correspondent, Li Qī, the largest newsprint production enterprise in China, Jilin Paper Mill, has brought good news: a type of offset cultural paper urgently needed by the publishing industry has been mass-produced in this mill. From April 1988 to the end of the year, 21,153 tons have been produced, filling a gap in China's offset cultural paper market.

	Jilin Paper Mill is a large-scale pulp and paper integrated enterprise in China. Its newsprint production capacity accounts for one-quarter of the nation's total, with high social demand and insufficient supply. If the mill only considers short-term benefits and does not undertake upgrades, it would not reduce profits. In 1984, the mill implemented a factory director term-target responsibility system. They predicted that with the development of printing technology, ordinary newsprint would gradually be replaced by offset cultural paper. If they did not start developing new products early, they would be at a disadvantage in the future. Therefore, in 1985, the mill began negotiations to introduce offset cultural paper production equipment and technology from abroad. By the end of 1987, they completed the construction and installation a year and a half ahead of schedule. In April 1988, they officially started production, doubling the mill's newsprint and high-grade cultural paper production capacity. Within 205 days of starting production, they recovered the full cost of purchasing the equipment.

	While introducing advanced technology and equipment, the mill also actively undertakes technical upgrades of old equipment. This nearly 50-year-old paper mill has mostly outdated equipment, with 10 paper machines, most of which are products from the 1920s and 1930s, increasingly unable to meet development needs. In recent years, the mill has invested over 45 million yuan to upgrade the chemical pulping, mechanical pulping, and alkali recovery systems. The entire old equipment's capacity has been increased by 67% compared to the original design, allowing the mill to produce an additional 40,000 tons of paper annually.

	Jilin Paper Mill focuses on both current raw material conservation and expansion, and the construction of paper-making forest bases. The mill established a forestry management office, took over a forest farm, and formed a joint venture with four other forest farms. They have planted 136,000 mu of forest on 790,000 mu of suitable land, with a timber stock of 130,000 cubic meters. Last year, the forest farm provided 15,000 cubic meters of timber, and in the future, the amount of timber supplied by the forest farm to the paper mill will gradually increase.

### 加强技术改造　建设原料基地  吉林造纸厂注重发展后劲

　　加强技术改造　建设原料基地
    吉林造纸厂注重发展后劲
    本报讯  记者李茜报道：我国最大的新闻纸生产企业吉林造纸厂传来喜讯：一种为新闻出版界所急需的胶印文化纸，在这个厂大批量投产，从１９８８年４月到年底，已生产２１１５３吨，填补了我国胶印文化纸的空白。
    吉林造纸厂是我国大型制浆、造纸综合性企业，其中新闻纸生产能力占全国１／４，社会需求量大，产品供不应求，如果只从近期效益考虑，不搞改造也不会减少利润。１９８４年该厂实行厂长任期目标责任制，他们预测到，随着印刷技术的发展，普通新闻纸必将逐步被胶印文化纸所取代，不及早动手开发新产品，日后必将被动。于是这个厂在１９８５年即着手洽谈从国外引进胶印文化纸生产设备和技术，１９８７年底提前一年多完成基建安装，１９８８年４月正式投产，使该厂新闻纸和高档文化纸的生产能力翻了一番，投产后的２０５天即收回全套设备的购置费用。
    在引进先进技术、设备的同时，工厂还积极进行老设备的技术改造。这个有近５０年厂龄的老纸厂，原有设备大都陈旧落后，１０台纸机大部分是２０年代和３０年代的产品，越来越不能适应发展的需要。最近几年，这个厂投资４５００多万元，对化浆、机浆、碱回收３个关键系统进行了技术改造，全厂基本实现了浆、碱自给，整个老设备比原设计能力提高６７％，每年可增产纸４万余吨。
    吉林造纸厂一手抓当前原材料的开源节流，一手抓造纸林基地建设，工厂设立了营林管理处，接办了一个林场，并与４个林场组成了联营公司，已在７９万亩宜林地上造林１３．６万亩，木材蓄积量１３万立方米，去年林场就提供１．５万立方米的木材，今后林场供应纸厂的木材将逐年增加。
