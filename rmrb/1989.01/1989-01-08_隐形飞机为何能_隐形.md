On November 22, 1988, the U.S. Air Force publicly displayed a B-2 "stealth" bomber that had been largely unknown for seven years. This aircraft resembles a bat, is 69 feet long, has a wingspan of 172 feet, has two seats inside, no fuselage or tail, and flies at subsonic speeds. Its most notable feature is its ability to penetrate enemy radar detection and defense systems and drop nuclear bombs, earning it the title of "a milestone in the modernization of the U.S. Air Force."

To understand how the B-2 bomber can be "stealthy," one must first understand the principles of radar detection.

Radar detection primarily uses radio waves to detect targets. Its working principle is similar to how bats fly and hunt. Bats emit ultrasonic waves during flight and use their sensitive ears to receive and analyze the echoes to determine the nature, direction, and distance of obstacles, allowing them to fly freely in the dark and accurately capture prey through "echo location."

Radar, on the other hand, emits radio waves instead of ultrasonic waves. An important characteristic of radio waves is that they produce reflections of varying strength when they encounter different objects, with metal objects reflecting radio waves particularly strongly.

To counter modern radar detection, researchers have developed various radar-absorbing materials. When applied to the surface of a target, these materials can absorb and scatter radar waves, reducing the target's radar reflection to the lowest possible level, making it difficult for radar to detect the target.

The B-2 bomber's ability to evade radar detection is mainly due to the use of radar-absorbing materials like carbon and epoxy in its airframe and external shell. Reports indicate that this aircraft appears on enemy radar screens as a target the size of a bird flying in the sky.

　　隐形飞机为何能“隐形”
    １９８８年１１月２２日，美国空军公开展示了一种７年来一直鲜为人知的Ｂ—２“隐形”轰炸机。它状似蝙蝠，长６９英尺，翼展为１７２英尺，机内有两个座位，没有机身和尾翼，飞行速度低于音速。其最大特点是能够突破敌方的雷达侦察防御体系，并能投掷核炸弹，因而被称为“美国空军现代化的里程碑”。
    要知道Ｂ—２轰炸机是如何“隐形”的，先得了解雷达侦察的原理。
    雷达侦察，主要是利用无线电波来探测目标。它的工作原理和蝙蝠飞行、捕食的技能非常相似。蝙蝠在飞行过程中，不断发出超声波，然后用它那敏锐的耳朵接收和分析回声，以判定障碍物的性质、方向和距离，使它能在漆黑的夜晚自由飞翔，同时通过“回声定位”，准确无误地捕获猎物。
    雷达发射的是无线电波而不是超声波。无线电波的一个重要特性，就是它碰到各种物体时，会产生强弱不同的反射，其中金属物体对无线电波的反射特别强烈。
    为了对付现代雷达的侦察，人们研究了种种吸收雷达波的涂料，将其涂在目标表面后，能吸收和散射雷达波，将目标的雷达波反射降到最低限度，使雷达难以探测到目标。
    Ｂ—２轰炸机之所以能逃避雷达的侦察，主要是飞机骨架和外壳系统的制造，采用了能吸收雷达波的碳素和环氧物等非金属材料的缘故。据报道，这种飞机在敌方雷达屏幕上所显示的目标，只有一只翱翔在天空中的飞鸟一般大小。
