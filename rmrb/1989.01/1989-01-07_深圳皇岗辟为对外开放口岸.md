Shenzhen Huanggang Opened as an International Port

	People's Daily, Shenzhen, reports: According to a reporter, Wang Chu, the State Council has approved the opening of Shenzhen Huanggang as an international port.

	Following Wenjindao and Shatoujiao, Huanggang Port will be the third land-connected highway port between the mainland and Hong Kong, and it is expected to officially open in August of this year.

	According to relevant information, Huanggang is located in the southwest of Shenzhen City and faces the New Territories of Hong Kong across the river. A steel-reinforced concrete highway bridge approximately 651 meters long connects the two places. Huanggang Port is a comprehensive port for both passengers and cargo, covering an area of 1 square kilometer.

	Relevant personnel here said that after Huanggang Port officially opens, the daily passenger flow will be 10,000 people, and the number of vehicles entering and exiting the border will be 10,000 vehicles per day, which will alleviate the current severe congestion of vehicles at Wenjindao Port.

	It is also learned that the 135-kilometer section of the highway from Huanggang Port to Guangzhou is under construction, and it is expected to be completed and put into use in 1991.

　　深圳皇岗辟为对外开放口岸
    本报深圳电  记者王楚报道：经国务院批准，深圳皇岗新辟为对外开放口岸。
    继文锦渡、沙头角之后，皇岗口岸将是中国大陆第三个陆地连接香港的公路口岸，预计今年８月正式开通。
    据有关资料透露，皇岗位于深圳市区西南方，与香港新界隔河相望。一座全长约为６５１米的钢筋混凝土公路桥，连接两地。皇岗口岸属客货两运综合性口岸，占地１平方公里。
    此间有关人士称，皇岗口岸正式开通后，客流量每日为１万人次，车辆日进出境１万车次，将缓解文锦渡口岸车辆目前堵塞严重困难。
    另据悉，皇岗口岸至广州的１３５公里路段正在兴建高速公路，预计１９９１年建成交付使用。
