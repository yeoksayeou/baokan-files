At the invitation of the Finnish government, Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization Yasser Arafat arrived in Helsinki today, beginning a two-day visit.

Finnish Foreign Minister Paavo Väyrynen and Arafat held political talks, discussing the Middle East situation and issues of mutual concern. President Mauno Koivisto and Prime Minister Harri Holkeri will also meet with the Palestinian guest today.

In recent years, Finland and the Palestine Liberation Organization have maintained high-level exchanges. Finland recognizes the Palestine Liberation Organization, believes that the Palestinian people have the right to self-determination, and actively supports the convening of an international Middle East conference attended by relevant parties.

Since 1967, Finland has participated in United Nations peacekeeping activities in the Middle East. Recently, the call for Middle East peace talks has grown louder among European countries.

　　阿拉法特抵达赫尔辛基
　　芬兰积极支持召开中东和会
    新华社赫尔辛基１月１６日电  应芬兰政府的邀请，巴勒斯坦解放组织主席阿拉法特今天抵达赫尔辛基，开始为时两天的访问。
    芬兰外长索尔萨和阿拉法特举行了政治会谈，讨论中东局势和双方共同关心的问题。科伊维斯托总统和霍尔克里总理今天也将分别会见巴勒斯坦贵宾。
    近年来，芬兰和巴勒斯坦解放组织一直保持着高层往来。芬兰承认巴勒斯坦解放组织，认为巴勒斯坦人民享有民族自决权，并积极支持召开有关方面参加的中东国际和会。
    从１９６７年开始，芬兰就参加联合国维持中东和平部队的活动。近来，欧洲国家要求中东和谈的呼声增高了。
