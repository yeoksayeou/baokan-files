	The Rolling Billiard Balls
	Tan Jian

	There is a friend of mine who, in his childhood, was poor and rather shabby, but now he is a wealthy individual entrepreneur with a car, smoking foreign cigarettes, and appearing very aristocratic. According to him, he is now a notable figure in his area, and as long as he wants to do something, almost nothing is impossible. Knowing his intelligence is average, I asked him the secret, and he replied, “I know how to handle that thing the foreigners call public relations.” When we discussed it further, I was astonished to find that his so-called public relations were actually “hand grenades” (alcohol), “twenty shots” (cigarettes), “big unity” (money), and so on.

	Another example is a fallen official who was the mastermind of a conspiracy. He spoke eloquently at banquets, always mentioning public relations when discussing deals, appearing very confident. Later, when he was investigated, it was found that he had evidence of bribery, but he defended himself vigorously: “All of that was used for public relations, I didn’t take a single cent for myself.”

	The oranges from the south become wild jujubes when they cross the river. A good and new social science—public relations—was introduced to us for the purpose of modernization, but unexpectedly, it was “transformed” by our people, mixed with feudalistic vulgar relationship learning, making people laugh and cry at the same time. Of course, both talk about relationships, but these relationships are not the same. The two are completely different in their origins, objects involved, methods, and effects. The former is a modern management science, while the latter is a behavior adopted for personal desires and cannot be seen in the light of day. They cannot be mentioned in the same breath.

	Some say that the Chinese are prone to the disease of swallowing things whole. I have never agreed with this. I think the Chinese are best at “nationalizing.” Lin Shu’s translations of novels are elegant and well-received, but his nationalizing also has laughable aspects. For example, when describing the behavior and mannerisms of Westerners, he uses the phrase “sweeping sleeves and adjusting skirts,” not knowing that Westerners wear suits and have no sleeves to sweep or skirts to adjust, unlike the Chinese who wear long robes and horse pants. Again, the famous British writer George Bernard Shaw, if translated according to general conventions, should be translated as Bernar Shuo, but someone nationalized it and changed it to Shaw Bernar, truly nationalized, with the surname Shaw and the given name Bernar, just missing a courtesy name for this foreigner. But this nationalization actually reversed the surname and given name.

	This illogical “nationalization” is ubiquitous in daily life. Recently, the billiard craze in cities is another example of bizarre nationalization. Billiards are originally a high-class recreational activity abroad. After work, after a bath, dressed neatly, standing in a quiet billiard room to play a few rounds, it is refreshing and enjoyable. Once introduced to China, it quickly changed. Not to mention the dusty environment by the roadside, or the players’ short pants and bare-chested, sweating like rain in the summer, just looking at the change in its function, even its inventor might not have expected it to become a tool for some people to gamble. According to a billiard stall owner, just his not-so-profitable location earns four or five “big unities” a day, with low costs and very little effort, just taking a cut, why not?

	Perhaps this ability to transform is a characteristic of our nation? I dare not judge. But I always think that for everything, we should still talk about specific situations and specific analyses, which is the best strategy. What should be transformed, transform it, but do not transform it blindly or arbitrarily, or paint it with feudal, backward, and ignorant colors. For example, when introducing cars, there is no need to transform it like the Empress Dowager Cixi, making the driver drive while kneeling; when introducing the violin, there is no need to transform it into playing it with an erhu bow; when introducing international chess, there is no need to transform it into moving the pieces along the roads...

	Shaw’s name has already become a convention, so it can continue to be called that; since billiards have been introduced, they should still be allowed to roll. Just don’t make the mistake of thinking that a network of relationships is public relations. Besides new terms and new entertainment, the important thing is the modernization of the economy and the nation. Without the improvement of the entire nation’s cultural quality, the “nationalization” of billiards and the like will continue to roll on.

　　滚动的台球
    谭健
    有一位朋友，儿时家贫，颇为寒酸，而今却是腰缠万贯的个体户了，出门小轿车，抽外烟，俨然一副贵族气派。据他自己讲，他现在也是那一方的人物，只要他想办的事，几乎没有办不成的。我知其才智平平，便询其究里，答曰：“我会搞那个外国人叫的什么公共关系。”再往深里谈，不禁使我愕然，原来他的所谓公共关系竟是“手榴弹”（酒）、“二十响”（烟）、“大团结”（钱）之类。
    另据报载，一官倒主谋谈吐不凡，每每在酒肉席上谈交易，言必称公共关系，煞是理直气壮。后被盘查，发现有若干行贿的罪证，但他却振振有辞地为自己辩护：那都用来搞公共关系了，我自己未捞一个子儿。
    南方之桔过江为枳。好端端的一门新兴的社会科学——公共关系学，引进来本是为我现代化所用的，不期为国人作神来个发挥，便私下“化”了，竟同封建主义的庸俗关系学混为一谈，着实让人啼笑皆非。固然都讲关系，但这关系不是那关系，二者从产生的条件、涉及的对象、手段、效果都风马牛不相及。前者是现代管理科学，后者是为了个人私欲以权经商而采取的不能见人的行为。它们根本不能同日而语。
    有人说国人易患生吞活剥之疾，我向来不以为然。我倒觉得国人最会“民族化”。林（纾）译小说文彩斐然，有口皆碑，但民族化得见笑处也能让人捧腹，如形容西人行为举止，便有“拂袖敛裾”一说，岂不知西人着西装，无袖可拂，无裾可敛，非长袍马褂之国人。再如英国著名作家Ｓｈａｗ，ＧｅｏｒｇｅＢｅｒｎａｒｄ，若按一般通行的惯例，应该译为伯纳肖，偏有人要民族化，便改译为肖伯纳，的的确确民族化了，姓肖，名伯纳，只差给这位洋人添个字号了。但这样一化，恰恰把姓和名弄颠倒了。
    这种不伦不类的“民族化”在日常生活中可谓俯拾即是。近来在城市里卷起的台球风，更是“民族化”得邪乎。台球在国外本是一项高雅的娱乐活动，工作之余，沐浴之后，衣冠整洁地站在雅静的台球室内打上两圈，舒心爽神。一引进国内很快就走味了。且不说那林立在马路旁尘土飞扬的环境，也不说娱乐者夏日那短裤赤膊、挥汗如雨的佛头着粪之举，单说它的功能之转变，恐怕连它的发明者也始料不及，它竟成了一些人进行赌博的工具了。据一位台球摊主透露，就他那个不大灵的位置，日进四五张“大团结”不为多，且成本低，又极省事，只须抽头便是，何乐不为？
    擅化或许是我们民族的一个特点？不敢妄断。但我总觉得凡事还是应当讲点具体情况具体分析，方为良策。该化的就化，但不能瞎化、胡化，或者将之涂上了封建、落后、愚昧的色彩。比方引进小轿车，就不必像慈禧太后那样，化作让司机跪着开车；引进小提琴就不必化作用二胡弓子拉弦；引进国际象棋就不必化作走车马路线……
    肖伯纳的名字已经约定俗成，自然可以继续叫下去；台球既然引进了，还是应当继续让它滚下去。只是不要再出“关系网就是公共关系”之类的误会。除了新名词、新娱乐，重要的还在于经济的现代化、民族的现代化。没有全民族文化素质的提高，恐怕台球之类的“民族化”还会照样滚动下去的。
