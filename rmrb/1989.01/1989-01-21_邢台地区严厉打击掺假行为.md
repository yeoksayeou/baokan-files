The People's Daily's November 26, 1988, issue published a letter to the editor titled "Joy Mixed with Concern," which caught the attention of the Xingtai Regional Committee.

An investigation revealed that the practice of adulterating wool is not limited to Weixian County in our region; it also exists to varying degrees in places like Nangong City and Qinghe County. In some areas, the adulteration rate in wool reaches about 80%. This illegal activity has been occurring in some parts of our region for many years.

Recently, after hearing a report on the investigation into the fake wool case in Weixian County, Regional Committee Secretary Li Mingzhu proposed launching a campaign to crack down on the production and sale of counterfeit goods from December 1988 to the Spring Festival of 1989. To this end, the Regional Committee issued a special notice. Li Mingzhu also repeatedly urged leaders at both the regional and county levels to take effective measures to address the issue of substandard goods.

　　邢台地区严厉打击掺假行为
    １９８８年１１月２６日你报第五版刊登《欣喜之余的担心》的读者来信后，引起了邢台地委的重视。
    据调查，在羊毛中掺假的情况，在我地区，不仅威县有，南宫市和清河县等一些地方也不同程度地存在，有些人在羊绒中掺假率达８０％左右，这种不法行为在我地区个别地方已存在多年了。
    最近，地委书记李明珠同志听了威县查处假羊毛案的汇报后提出，１９８８年１２月到１９８９年春节期间，在全地区开展一次打击制售假冒商品的活动。为此，地委专门发出通知。李明珠同志还先后要求地、县两级领导同志积极采取有效措施，解决伪劣商品的问题。
