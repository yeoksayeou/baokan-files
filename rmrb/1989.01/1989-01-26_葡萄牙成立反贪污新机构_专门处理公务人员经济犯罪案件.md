Portugal has established a new anti-corruption agency.

According to a recent issue of the weekly *Expresso*, the Portuguese Attorney General's Office has recently established a Public Prosecution Office dedicated to handling cases of corruption, bribery, and other serious economic crimes involving public officials.

This new department will be based within the Judicial Police and will have a staff of 20 to 25 prosecutors.

The report states that the newly established Public Prosecution Office complements the existing High Anti-Corruption Commission, with both entities working in full cooperation. Their roles are not only consistent but also supportive of each other.

Additionally, it has been reported that in Portugal, there have been questions raised about the integrity of high-ranking government officials, with some individuals specifically criticizing certain officials for abusing their power for personal gain. In the Portuguese Parliament, similar questions have been raised by members, which has drawn the attention of the highest authorities in Portugal.

　　葡萄牙成立反贪污新机构    
    专门处理公务人员经济犯罪案件
    新华社里斯本１月２３日电  据最近一期《快报》周刊报道，葡萄牙总检察院最近成立了一个公共检察局，专门负责处理有关公务人员在经济领域内贪污、受贿和其它恶性犯罪案件。
    这个新部门将设在司法警察局之内，它拥有２０名至２５名检察官员。
    报道说，新成立的公共检察局与已存在的最高反腐化委员会的职能不仅不悖，而且是一致的，它们之间的关系是一种全面的相互合作关系。
    另据报道，在葡萄牙已有人对政府高级官员从政是否清廉提出了质疑，并指名道姓批评某些高级官员利用职权营私舞弊。在葡萄牙议会中，也有议员提出了类似问题，这已引起葡萄牙最高当局的注意。
