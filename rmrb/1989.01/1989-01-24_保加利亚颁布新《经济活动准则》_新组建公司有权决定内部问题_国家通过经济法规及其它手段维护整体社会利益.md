    Bulgaria Enacts New Economic Activity Regulations
    Newly Established Companies Have the Right to Decide Internal Issues
    The State Maintains Overall Social Interests Through Economic Regulations and Other Means

    Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, January 22 (Reporter Wang Jinbo) The State Council of Bulgaria recently issued new "Economic Activity Regulations," stipulating that newly established economic companies have the right to decide all internal matters.

    This new "Economic Activity Regulations" stipulates that companies can independently formulate plans, determine the production and organizational structure within the company, clarify the obligations and responsibilities of subsidiaries, and solve various management issues within the company to ensure the collective interests of the company itself.

    This regulation also stipulates that in the future, the maintenance of overall social interests will be directly realized through national plans, national budgets, and a set of economic regulations and various adjustment measures to ensure the implementation of the plan. The economic adjustment measures implemented by the state include the total amount of taxes, tariffs and subsidies, foreign exchange quotas, interest rates, principles of labor remuneration, prices, state-ordered quantities, and depreciation standards for equipment, etc.

    In terms of protecting the personal interests of workers, this regulation stipulates that in the future, not only in the social scope, but also within the collective where the individual works, personal interests will be protected by law.

    This regulation also stipulates that the state allows citizens to establish private companies of varying sizes, either collectively or in partnership.

    The December 1988 plenary session of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party decided to implement a company-based reform of economic organizations, aiming to completely abandon administrative command methods in enterprise management, eliminate all bureaucratism, and make each link become a commodity producer operating on the basis of economic accounting.

    Local economists believe that turning economic organizations into real companies and changing the relationship between companies and state agencies into economic relationships can not only create conditions for the development of various forms of socialist ownership but also effectively eliminate administrative commands and bureaucratism in economic management, and fundamentally change the formalistic tendencies that existed in the institutional reforms of the past two years.

　　保加利亚颁布新《经济活动准则》    
    新组建公司有权决定内部问题    
    国家通过经济法规及其它手段维护整体社会利益
    新华社索非亚１月２２日电（记者王金柏）保加利亚国务委员会最近颁布了新的《经济活动准则》，规定新组建的经济公司有权决定内部的一切问题。
    这项新的《经济活动准则》规定，公司可以完全独立自主地制订计划、确定公司内部的生产和组织结构、明确分公司的义务和责任、解决公司内部的各种管理等问题，以此来确保公司本身的集体利益。
    这项《经济活动准则》还规定，今后维护整体社会利益将直接通过国家计划、国家预算和保证计划实施的整套经济法规以及各种调节手段来实现。国家实施的经济调节手段包括税收总额、关税和补贴、外汇额度、利率、劳动报酬原则、价格、国家订货数量和设备折旧标准等方面。
    在维护劳动者的个人利益方面，这项准则规定，今后不仅在社会范围内，而且在劳动者个人工作的那个集体内，个人利益将受到法律保护。
    这项准则同时规定，国家允许公民个人组建规模不等的集体或合伙的私有公司。
    保共中央１９８８年１２月全会作出决定，对经济组织实行公司化改革，目的在于在企业管理中完全抛弃行政命令的管理办法，破除一切官僚主义，使各个环节都变成在经济核算基础上开展经营活动的商品生产者。
    此间经济学家认为，使经济组织变成真正的公司，把公司同国家机关的关系变成经济关系，不仅能为发展多种形式的社会主义所有制创造条件，而且能有效地根除经济管理中的行政命令和官僚主义，彻底改变前两年机构改革中存在的改换名称的形式主义倾向。
