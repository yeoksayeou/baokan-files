Currently, some enterprises are using high-interest rates to raise funds from their own employees, and even publicly from society, issuing bonds, which has led to a shift in bank savings deposits, rendering financial macro-control ineffective, and making it difficult to cool down the overheated economic growth rate. For example, in Lishui City, Zhejiang Province, 8 enterprises raised 1.7 million yuan in just late October 1988; in Lanxi City, the Yunshan Pharmaceutical Factory and the Construction Hardware General Factory raised 2 million yuan in just 10 days. During the same period, the savings deposits of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of Lanxi City decreased by over 1 million yuan.

Currently, corporate fundraising has the following characteristics: First, it is widespread and involves large amounts of money. Information from various provinces indicates that corporate fundraising is prevalent nationwide, with some enterprises raising tens of millions of yuan and others raising hundreds of millions. Second, the interest rates are high. The fundraising interest rates in Lishui and Lanxi cities are as high as 2.5% per month, with the highest nationwide reaching over 3% per month, and the interest is included in the cost. Third, the fundraising methods are diverse, and the funds are occupied for a relatively long time. Corporate fundraising generally takes the form of stocks and bonds, with the funds being occupied for about a year.

Corporate fundraising has caused several adverse effects. Firstly, it is difficult to control the rapid economic growth. The statistics in October 1988 proved this. Secondly, it directly affects the growth of bank savings. Thirdly, it is not conducive to adjusting the industrial, product, and credit structures, affecting the better use of the country's limited funds and resources. Fourthly, it is not conducive to stabilizing prices and curbing inflation, bringing difficulties to the rectification of the economic environment and the rectification of the economic order.

I believe that relevant departments should strictly control corporate fundraising and formulate management measures for corporate fundraising to allow banks to have some control over corporate fundraising.

### 企业集资冲击国家金融调控

　　企业集资冲击国家金融调控
    目前，一些企业用高利率向本单位职工，甚至向社会公开集资，发行债券，造成银行储蓄存款搬家，金融宏观调控失效，过热的经济增长速度难以降温的状况。如浙江丽水市８家企业，仅１９８８年１０月下旬就集资１７０万元；兰溪市云山制药厂和建筑五金总厂两家企业，１０天内就集资２００万元。同期，兰溪市工商银行储蓄存款下降１００多万元。
    目前，企业集资有以下的特点：一是面广金额大。从各省获得的信息表明，全国普遍存在企业集资热，有的企业集资少则几十万元，多则数百万元。二是利率高。丽水、兰溪两市的企业集资利率，最高的月息二分五，全国最高的集资月息达三分多，且利息计入成本。三是集资形式多样，资金占用时间较长。企业集资一般采用股票、债券等形式，资金占用时间多在一年左右。
    企业集资造成一些不良影响。首先，经济增长过快的势头难以控制，１９８８年１０月，我国的统计数字就证明了这一点。其次，直接影响银行的储蓄增长。第三，不利于调整产业、产品和信贷结构，影响国家有限资金和资源的更好利用。第四，还不利于稳定物价和抑制通货膨胀，给治理经济环境，整顿经济秩序带来困难。
    我认为，有关部门要严格控制企业集资，制订企业集资的管理办法，使银行对企业集资有所制约。
