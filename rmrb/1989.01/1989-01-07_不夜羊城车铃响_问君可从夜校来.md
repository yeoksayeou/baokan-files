Despite the "reading is useless" theory gaining traction in many places, many young workers in Guangzhou feel that learning is never enough and eagerly enroll in evening schools to study scientific knowledge.

After 9 PM, streets like Dongfeng Road, Zhongshan Road, and Renmin Road in Guangzhou are often filled with people riding bicycles. The cheerful laughter and the clear sound of bicycle bells intertwine, adding a unique charm to the night in the city. These young men and women, whether in cold or hot weather, in wind or rain, never stop.

In Guangzhou, music cafes and dance halls that were once popular are now somewhat deserted, while evening schools remain thriving. More and more young workers and individual entrepreneurs are treating the evening as a golden period to learn scientific and cultural knowledge. Apart from correspondence universities and TV universities, over 200 professional evening schools and numerous short-term professional and technical training classes are scattered throughout the city. According to relevant departments, the number of people studying in various evening schools in Guangzhou each year has reached over 200,000 in recent years.

Many young people who dropped out of school to become individual entrepreneurs now feel the lack of technical and knowledge skills, and have reconnected with books to deepen their professional skills. A young man who runs a clothing stall on Beijing Road was once a high school dropout who spent his evenings in music cafes or dance halls. In the past two years, he has shifted his focus to books, studying clothing design and cutting at night schools. Now, his designed fashion styles are novel and sell well, transforming him from a "street kid" into a somewhat famous fashion designer. He says, "The ancient saying 'Books contain treasures' now makes perfect sense to me."

On Shahe Street, there are two stalls selling roasted geese and ducks. The one on the east side does better business than the one on the west. The young man from the west side paid to study culinary techniques at an evening school. After some effort, his roasted geese and ducks are much better in color and taste than those from the east side, and his business is thriving. Now, people often see him carrying books, studying culinary knowledge whenever he has spare time.

### 不夜羊城车铃响　问君可从夜校来

　　不夜羊城车铃响
  　问君可从夜校来
    新华社广州１月６日电  （记者李沪）尽管“读书无用”论在许多地方有所抬头，但是广州不少在职青年却深感学而知不足，竞相上业余夜校学习科学知识。
    夜晚９时以后，广州市区的东风路、中山路、人民路等街道，每每涌现出骑自行车的人流。那爽朗的欢笑和清脆的车铃声交织在一起，为羊城之夜增添了风韵。这些从夜校归家的青年男女，不论寒来暑往、风里雨里，从不间断。
    在广州曾经流行一时的音乐茶座和舞厅，现在都有些门庭冷落，而业余夜校却长盛不衰。越来越多的青年职工、个体户把晚上作为学习科学技术、文化知识的黄金时期。除函授大学、电视大学外，２００多家专业夜校及众多的短期专业技术培训班，遍布白云山下和珠江两岸。据有关部门统计，近年来广州在各类业余夜校就读的人数，每年都达２０多万。
    不少为了赚钱而辍学当个体户的青年，现在痛感自己的技术、知识的不足，重新与书本结缘，加深专业修养。北京路一服装摊档的档主原是个辍学的高中生，前些时他白天赚了钱，晚上就出没于音乐茶座或舞厅。这两年他把追求的眼光转向书本，先后到夜校学习服装裁剪、设计。现在他设计的时装款式新颖，销路通畅，从一名“街边仔”变为有一定名气的时装设计师。他说：“书中自有黄金屋”这句古话，现在念起来觉得顺理成章了。
    沙河街有两家经营烧烤鹅鸭的店铺，东边这家生意比西边那家兴旺得多。西边那家的青年就自费到业余夜校学习烹饪技术。经过一段时间的努力，他做出来的烧鹅烤鸭，色味都比东边那家好得多，生意日渐兴隆。现在，人们也常常见到他随身带着书本，一有空就埋头钻研烹饪知识。
