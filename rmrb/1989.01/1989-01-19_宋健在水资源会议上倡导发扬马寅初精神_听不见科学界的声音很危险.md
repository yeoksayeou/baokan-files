	Song Jian, State Councilor and Minister of the State Science and Technology Commission, said at the opening of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Geological Sciences Division's symposium on the rational development and utilization of water resources (focusing on the North China region) today that China is in a stage of economic takeoff, which will inevitably bring about some major problems. Only through scientific analysis can we propose correct solutions. We hope that leaders at all levels of government will seriously listen to the opinions of scientists and adopt those that have been thoroughly scientifically verified and are in line with national conditions.

	Song Jian believes that even if for various reasons the opinions of scientists cannot be adopted at the moment, the scientific community should not mistakenly think that their opinions on major social issues have no effect. The experience of Mr. Ma Yinchu and his spirit of adhering to the truth are proof of this.

	Song Jian said, in the 1950s, Mr. Ma Yinchu, based on scientific theory, advocated for China to appropriately limit the rate of population growth. Society did not understand his theory, and instead, from 1958 to 1959, launched a nationwide criticism of him. However, at the end of 1959, he still issued a statement: "I believe that academic debates are valuable, the more debate, the clearer it becomes, and it is not advisable to have the idea of 'retreat and avoid' when faced with attacks. On the contrary, one should advance in the face of difficulties and never yield to them. I believe that research work requires preparation beforehand, and one should not write articles without being sure. Once written, one should bravely correct mistakes, but one should insist on the truth." Song Jian said that after the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, Mr. Ma Yinchu was completely rehabilitated, and his economic theories on comprehensive economic balance and new population theory were fully affirmed.

	Song Jian said that China, in its stage of reform, opening up, and economic takeoff, needs contemporary scientific knowledge and systematic scientific analysis the most. If the voice of the scientific community is raised and strengthened, there is great hope for China. On the contrary, if the voice of the scientific community is not heard, it would be very dangerous. Mistakes in scientific decision-making will result in the loss of several generations, and future generations will have to pay several times the price to correct the mistakes, or they may never be able to correct them.

	Song Jian said that in recent years, both the scientific community and various government departments have recognized that the three biggest problems China faces in its economic construction and social development are population, resources, and the environment. The most specific and urgent problems at present are population, food, and water. North China and the northwest face the severe problem of water resource shortages. The five provinces and municipalities in North China have a population of 126 million, with a runoff water resource of about 50 billion cubic meters. Even if all of it is utilized, the per capita amount is only 400 cubic meters. Groundwater extraction has already exceeded the limit by more than 80%. China is one of the countries with the least water resources per capita in the world. With the current population growth rate, the per capita water availability will rapidly decrease. Song Jian expressed his hope to the nearly 100 experts attending the conference: to come up with specific measures through the research and discussion of scientists at this conference, to raise the awareness of water conservation and the development of water-saving agriculture among governments at all levels and the general public, and to contribute to the solution of the rational development and utilization of water resources in North China.

　　宋健在水资源会议上倡导发扬马寅初精神
    听不见科学界的声音很危险
    本报北京１月１８日讯  本报记者王溪元、中国科学报记者李存富报道：国务委员兼国家科委主任宋健在今天开幕的中国科学院地学部水资源合理开发利用（华北地区为主）研讨会上说，中国正处在经济起飞阶段，必然会出现一些重大问题，只能依靠科学分析，才能提出正确的解决办法。我们希望各级政府的领导同志都能认真听取科学家们的意见，采纳那些经过充分科学论证又符合国情的意见。
    宋健认为，即便因为这样那样的原因，科学家的意见一时不能被采纳，科学界也不要误以为自己对重大社会问题的意见没有发生作用。马寅初先生的经历和他坚持真理的精神就是证明。
    宋健说，马寅初先生５０年代从科学的理论出发，呼吁中国适当限制人口的增长速度。社会并没有理解他的理论，相反，于１９５８至１９５９年对他开展了全国性的批判。但他在１９５９年底还发表声明：“我认为学术贵于争辩，愈辩愈明，不宜一遇袭击，就抱明哲保身、退避三舍的念头。相反，要知难而进，决不向困难低头。我认为研究工作事前要有准备，没有把握不要乱写文章。既写之后，要勇于更正错误，但要坚持真理。”宋健说，党的十一届三中全会以后，马寅初先生得到了彻底平反，他的关于经济综合平衡和新人口论的经济理论得到了全面肯定。
    宋健说，处于改革、开放和经济起飞阶段的中国，最需要的是当代科学知识和系统的科学分析。科学界的声音高了、强大了，中国的事情就大有希望。相反，科学界的声音听不见了，那就很危险。在科学决策上的失误将导致几代人的损失，后来人将要付出数倍的代价，才能把失误纠正过来，也可能永远不能纠正。
    宋健说，近几年来，中国科学界和各政府部门都认识到，中国在经济建设和社会发展过程中碰到的最大问题有三个：人口、资源和环境。当前最具体、最迫切的是人口、粮食和水这三个问题。我国华北和西北部面临着水资源短缺这个严峻问题。华北五省市区有１．２６亿人口，径流水资源约５００亿立方米，全部利用起来，人均不过４００立方米。地下水开采已经过量，达８０％以上。我国是世界上人均水资源较贫乏的国家，按现在人口增长速度，人均占水量还将迅速下降。宋健对参加这次会议的近百位专家提出希望：要在这次会议上，通过科学家们的研究讨论，拿出具体措施，唤起各级政府和全体人民节约用水和发展节水农业的意识，为解决华北水资源合理开发利用做出贡献。
