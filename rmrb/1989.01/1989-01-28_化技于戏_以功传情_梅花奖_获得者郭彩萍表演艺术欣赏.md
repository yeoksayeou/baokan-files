In the realm of opera, the common ailments of young male roles (xiaosheng) are threefold: first, an overabundance of powdered makeup, leading to a one-sided interpretation of the supposed "refined and elegant" demeanor, thus losing the masculine virility; second, a lack of scholarly air, resulting in a superficial and vulgar appearance; third, a weak foundation in the roles of feathered young men and martial young men, with the performance of dragon robes and waistcoats either rigid or slack. However, Guo Caiping, the renowned female young male actor in Jin opera who has just been selected for the sixth "Plum Blossom Award," does not have these issues. Watching her performance, my impression is characterized by three "noble" qualities: a handsome and noble demeanor, noble in possessing masculine virility; a spiritual and ethereal presence, noble in integrating technique into performance; and agile and skilled movements, noble in conveying emotion through skill.

I believe that, aside from her personal talents, Guo Caiping's artistic experience offers us at least three insights:

Firstly, the initial training must be correct, and one must learn extensively, think deeply, and practice diligently. She studied under the renowned Jin opera master Guo Fengying, starting with roles like "Yellow Crane Tower" and "Small Banquet." This is crucial for cultivating and training the virile qualities of young male actors, especially female young male actors. For example, in Peking opera, one should start with roles like "Yellow Crane Tower," "Rendezvous by the River," and "The Feast at Hong Gate" for feathered young men, and "Shi Xiu's Investigation," "Yue Family Village," and "Eight Hammers" for martial young men. This is the correct path for young male actors. Guo Caiping not only learned many roles from her own opera genre but also sought advice from masters of other opera genres such as Yang Youhe, Zeng Ronghua, Yi Zhengxiang, Hong Xiannü, and Chang Xiangyu, learning various skills and techniques. By learning from multiple masters, one can then integrate and refine these skills, ultimately creating a unique style. Wang Yaoci once said, "Skill comes from practice, but true skill comes from thinking." Therefore, actors must combine deep thinking with diligent practice. Without deep thinking, one cannot achieve high-level skills and strong expressive power; without diligent practice, one will either become rigid or overly smooth. When Guo Caiping was practicing "Small Banquet," she often wore the helmet all day, and whenever she had a moment, she would practice with the two feathers, to the point of rubbing a hard callus on her forehead. She practiced leg work while hanging from her legs and reading books. Reading, writing, and painting are the three essentials for enhancing scholarly air, with reading being the most important.

Secondly, one must master the techniques precisely and use them naturally. This requires meticulous study and careful selection, thus integrating technique into performance. By meticulous study, I mean deeply understanding the character's personality and mindset. For example, after comparing the upbringing, moral integrity, behavior, and speech patterns of Lü Bu and Zhou Yu, Guo Caiping realized that Lü Bu's character is outwardly noble but inwardly base—he appears arrogant and domineering to show his noble status, but inwardly he is a base person who abandons righteousness for gain, loves alcohol, and is promiscuous; while Zhou Yu is outwardly respectful but inwardly arrogant—although he is the commander of the three armies, he is polite and meticulous in his interactions, but inwardly he is arrogant and narrow-minded. After meticulous study, one must then carefully select, that is, combine one's own conditions and choose the best means of expression to highlight one's strengths. Guo Caiping, in order to integrate technique into performance, focused on portraying the character. In "Small Banquet," she made countless small changes and several major changes to the role of Lü Bu. From the way the feathers are handled to the footwork, everything is different from the original, and she developed the single feather into a double feather, adding double quick feather twirls and more.

Thirdly, handling the feathers is a special skill that many Shanxi clapper opera actors are proficient in. This technique itself has high aesthetic value in terms of form. However, excellent actors do not merely show off, pile up, or exhibit their technical skills; instead, they pursue conveying emotion through skill—making the feathers "speak," turning them into a performing vocabulary, conveying the character's inner voice. Handling the feathers is a "gesture" dance that externalizes the character's inner emotions. Lü Bu handling the feathers in front of Diao Chan conveys his admiration and flirtation; Guo Caiping uses the feather technique to express the character's emotions, guiding the audience's imagination and association, achieving a unity of sincerity and beauty, making the audience both spiritually moved and visually pleased. If one insists on finding a "reasonable action logic" for Lü Bu handling the feathers in real life, one would be stuck in a corner, contradicting oneself, and spoiling the effect.

　　化技于戏　以功传情    
    ——“梅花奖”获得者郭彩萍表演艺术欣赏
    朱文相
    在戏曲舞台上，小生演员的“常见病”、“多发病”，一是脂粉气浓，片面理解所谓“斯文风流”，失去男性阳刚之美；二是缺少书卷气，显得浮华俗气；三是翎子生和武小生戏的功底差，穿蟒扎靠的工架非僵即懈。而刚刚入选第六届“梅花奖”的著名晋剧女小生郭彩萍却没有这些毛病。看她的表演，我的观感则是三个“贵”字：神姿帅美，贵有阳刚之气；灵动脱俗，贵在化技于戏；身手边式，贵能以功传情。
    我想，除了个人的天赋条件之外，郭彩萍的艺术经验至少可给我们以下三点启示：
    其一，开蒙路子要正，还得广学博采，勤思苦练。她拜晋剧前辈名小生郭凤英为师，先学的就是《黄鹤楼》、《小宴》等。这对培养训练小生演员，尤其是女小生的阳刚气质，十分重要。拿京剧小生来说，也要以《黄鹤楼》、《临江会》、《群英会》等翎子生戏和《石秀探庄》、《岳家庄》、《八大锤》等武小生戏打基础。这是小生开蒙的正途。郭彩萍不但学了本剧种的许多剧目，而且还向兄弟剧种的名家如阳友鹤、曾荣华、易征祥、红线女、常香玉等多方请益，学习各种功夫技巧。转益多师，广学博采，然后才能融会提炼，自成一格。王瑶卿先生曾说：“熟能生巧未必巧，要想生巧须用脑。”所以，演员必须把勤思与苦练结合起来。勤思而不苦练，没有高超的技艺，就没有强大的表现力；苦练而不勤思，就会越练越僵或越练越油。郭彩萍学排《小宴》时，常常整天戴着盔头练，一有空就摆弄那两根翎子，以致在前额上磨出硬皮来。她练腿功还边吊腿，边看书。读书、写字、画画，是提高书卷气的三要素，尤以读书为最。
    其二，程式技术既要学死了（熟练、准确、规范地掌握），又要用活了（自然、顺畅、灵动地运用）。这就要精研善择，从而化技于戏。所谓精研，即精心琢磨角色的性格和心态。比如，郭彩萍在比较了吕布与周瑜的出身教养、道德情操、行为方式和语言特点等之后，悟出吕布的人物特征是外贵而内贱——外表矜持跋扈以显温侯之尊贵，骨子里却是见利弃义、嗜酒好色的轻贱之徒；而周瑜则是外恭而内倨——身为三军都督，待人接物恭谨周到、干练机警，而内心却恃才傲物、气狭量窄。精研之后，还须善择，即结合演员自身条件，优选表现手段以发挥特长。郭彩萍为了化技于戏，着力刻画人物，演《小宴》的吕布，小改不计其数，大改也有四五次。从翎子的耍法到脚下的步法，都与原来的不同，还将过去的单立翎发展为双立翎，并增加了双快绕翎等。
    其三，耍翎子，是很多山西梆子演员都擅用的特技。这种技巧本身，在形式美上就有很高的欣赏价值。但优秀的演员决不满足于技巧功夫的卖弄、堆砌和展览，而是追求以功传情——让翎子“说话”，变成一种表演语汇，传达角色的心声。耍翎子，是人物内心情感外化的“状情”之舞。吕布在貂蝉面前耍翎子，是传达他的爱慕、挑逗之心；郭彩萍以翎子功抒发人物的心绪，诱导观众的想象和联想，达到情真与形美的统一，令人神会而目愉。如果一定要以生活的真实，为吕布耍翎子找出所谓“合理的行动逻辑”，那就会钻进牛角尖儿，自相矛盾，弄巧成拙了。
