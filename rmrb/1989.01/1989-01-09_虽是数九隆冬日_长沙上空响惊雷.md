Although it is the coldest time of winter, thunder roared in the skies over Changsha on the afternoon of the 6th, accompanied by heavy rain. According to meteorological data up to 8 a.m. on the 7th, some places in Hunan Province received as much as 37 millimeters of rain in 24 hours.

An old saying goes, "Winter thunder, nine out of ten cattle sheds will be empty," reflecting the traditional belief that winter thunder is an omen of bad luck. In reality, however, it is a normal natural phenomenon.

Meteorologist Li Guomin explained to the reporter that this rare winter thunder was caused by a strong warm air current in the lower atmosphere over Hunan, while very cold air moved in from above. This created a highly unstable atmospheric layer, with rapid exchange of air between the upper and lower levels, forming strong vertical air currents. As a result, a thunderstorm developed in the rising air currents. This thunderstorm lasted for half a day. After the rain, the streets and alleys of Changsha were clean and fresh, presenting a new and refreshing scene.

　　虽是数九隆冬日
    长沙上空响惊雷
    据新华社长沙１月８日电  （记者刘志权）冬日里打雷，被很多人视为稀奇，然而６日下午长沙上空雷声大作，暴雨如注。据到７日上午８点止的气象资料，２４小时内湖南地区有的地方降雨高达３７毫米。
    民谚曰“雷打冬，十个牛栏九个空”，这是人们过去认为冬雷不吉的说法，实际并非如此，而是一种正常自然现象。
    气象专家李国民向记者解释说，这次罕见冬雷，是因近来湖南上空低空的暖气流很强，而此时高空有很冷的空气移来，造成上空大气层结极不稳定，上下空气交换很快，形成了很强的垂直升降气流，于是在上升气流中形成了雷暴。这场雷暴持续了半天时间，雷雨一过，长沙市大街小巷洁净如洗，一派清新气象。
