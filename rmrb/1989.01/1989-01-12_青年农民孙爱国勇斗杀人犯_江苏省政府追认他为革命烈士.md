Recently, the Jiangsu Provincial People's Government made a decision to posthumously recognize young farmer Sun Aiguo, who bravely fought against two armed fugitives and sacrificed his life, as a revolutionary martyr.

The 26-year-old Sun Aiguo was the manager of the Cooperative Store in Muxi Township, Guanyun County, Jiangsu Province. On the afternoon of October 31 last year, the nationally wanted armed murderers Song Changjiang and Bai Xingzhou from Harbin fled to Guanyun County to commit crimes. Upon hearing the news, Sun Aiguo rode his bicycle to pursue them. At that time, someone advised him, "The fugitives have guns; it's too dangerous." Sun Aiguo did not hesitate and continued the pursuit. When he caught up with the fugitives, he suddenly grabbed one of their collars. The vicious fugitives opened fire, and Sun Aiguo was hit by three bullets in the head and chest, falling into a pool of blood. Sun Aiguo's actions provided the direction of the fugitives' escape to the public security organs, buying time for the capture of the criminals. By the early morning of the next day, Song and Bai were killed by our encirclement forces for resisting arrest. After the news of Sun Aiguo's sacrifice spread, many military and revolutionary families, old party members, five-guarantee households, individual business owners, and young people who had established families with his help, all went to the village party branch secretary's home to express their gratitude and remembrance for the martyr.

　　青年农民孙爱国勇斗杀人犯
    江苏省政府追认他为革命烈士
    本报讯  最近，江苏省人民政府作出决定，追认在同两名持枪杀人逃犯英勇搏斗中壮烈牺牲的青年农民孙爱国为革命烈士。
    ２６岁的孙爱国是江苏省灌云县穆圩乡合作商店经理。去年１０月３１日下午，全国通缉的哈尔滨持枪杀人犯宋长江、白醒洲窜到灌云县作案，孙爱国闻讯骑车追赶。当时有人劝他：逃犯有枪，太危险了。孙爱国毫不犹豫，紧追不舍。当迫近逃犯时，他猛然抓住了其中一名逃犯的衣领，穷凶极恶的逃犯开枪了，孙爱国头部、胸部连中３枪，倒在血泊之中。孙爱国的行动为公安机关提供了罪犯逃窜的方向，为围捕罪犯赢得了时机。次日凌晨，宋、白二犯因开枪拒捕，被我围捕人员击毙。孙爱国牺牲的消息传开后，许多受过他照顾、帮助的军烈属、老党员、五保户、个体户，以及在他热心帮助下成家立业的年轻人，都跑到村党支部书记家中诉说他们对烈士的感激和怀念之情。
