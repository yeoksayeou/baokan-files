	Wuhan is draped in a silver-white blanket, and the Yangtze and Han rivers have lost their usual roar. This morning, the Wuhan Municipal Government held a solemn memorial service to honor eight firefighters who sacrificed their lives while fighting a massive oil barge fire on the Yangtze River.

	On January 2, Wuhan's public security firefighters bravely fought against the oil barge fire to protect state property and public safety.

	The Wuhan Municipal Government's eulogy highly praised the eight firefighters' revolutionary heroism, noting their fearlessness and selflessness in the face of danger. It stated that their deeds will be recorded in the annals of Wuhan's socialist spiritual civilization construction.

	State Councilor and Minister of Public Security Wang Fang sent a wreath. The relatives of Program Jiefa and the other seven firefighters, as well as officials from the Ministry of Communications, the Ministry of Public Security Fire Bureau, and the Hubei Province and Wuhan Municipal Government, attended the memorial service.

	After the memorial service, officials from Hubei Province, Wuhan City, the Ministry of Communications, and the Ministry of Public Security Fire Bureau visited the families of the fallen firefighters and representatives of the injured firefighters at the Hubei Provincial Party Committee Hall. Vice Minister of Communications Zheng Guangdi and Director of the Ministry of Public Security Fire Bureau Chen Wengui read condolence messages on behalf of the National Safety Production Committee and the Ministry of Public Security, respectively.

	It is reported that, on January 10, the National Safety Production Committee, with the approval of Premier Li Peng and State Councilor Zhou Jiahua, sent a condolence message expressing heartfelt condolences to those who contributed to the fight against the Yangtze River oil barge fire and the rescue of state property.

	The condolence message stated, "After the explosion of the Yangtze River oil barge, the Hubei Provincial Government, the Ministry of Communications, the Ministry of Public Security, and the General Staff Department quickly organized forces to rush to the scene for firefighting and rescue. They demonstrated an indomitable spirit and quickly controlled the river pollution, restoring the order of Yangtze River navigation, making contributions to the state and the people. We hereby express our deep condolences to the firefighters who sacrificed their lives in the fight against the fire and rescue of state property; we extend our sincere condolences to their families and those injured in the firefighting; and we commend the units and individuals who made contributions to the rescue."
