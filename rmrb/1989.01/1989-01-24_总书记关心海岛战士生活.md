	General Secretary Cares for the Lives of Island Soldiers

	Xinhua News Agency reporter Wú Dōngfēng

	Just before the Spring Festival, a beautifully crafted New Year's greeting letter was sent from the vast expanse of the sea at the mouth of the Zhujiang River on Guishan Island to Zhongnanhai in Beijing. The entire garrison on the island reported to the General Secretary of the Central Committee, Zhao Ziyang, that they had adapted to local conditions to develop agricultural and sideline production, increase income, and improve their diet.

	It was the morning of the Lunar New Year's Eve last year when the General Secretary of the Central Committee, Zhao Ziyang, visited Guishan Island. He learned about the fishermen's efforts to increase their income through net cage fish farming and inquired about the living conditions of the garrisoned troops. The battalion commander and political instructor honestly told the General Secretary that the soldiers' lives were not as good as those of the island fishermen. Zhao Ziyang suggested that they engage in net cage fish farming to improve the soldiers' lives and instructed the leaders of Guangdong Province and Zhuhai City to provide technical and financial support to the troops, paving the way for joint prosperity between the military and civilians. When he met with the military region leaders in Guangzhou, he again mentioned the matter of the Guishan Island troops' fish farming, hoping that the military region could provide some support to improve the lives of the island soldiers.

	In the face of limited military funding and rising prices, ensuring that the basic living standards of frontline troops do not decline has been a challenge for the Guishan Island garrison in recent years. The General Secretary's suggestion pointed them in a new direction. In early April, the commander of the Guangzhou Military Region, Zhang Wannian, instructed the military region's logistics department and the leaders of the Guangdong Military Region to visit the island, along with relevant experts, to investigate and discuss the matter, allocating special funds to support the Guishan Island garrison in developing marine net cage aquaculture. The mayor of Zhuhai, Liang Guangda, said that the local development of the island economy could not do without the military, and they would definitely support the military's net cage fish farming. The Guishan Town government allocated a water area with small waves and good sunlight to the troops and dispatched experienced technicians to help the troops assemble the net cages. The Guishan Island Fishery Joint Venture Company helped purchase high-quality fish fry. Experienced fish farmers taught the soldiers the skills and techniques.

	After a year, the Guishan Island garrison's net cage fish farming began to show results. The 18 net cages released more than 16,000 stone bass and spotted seatrout. The first batch of marketable fish has been released. The dining tables in the units have meat, fish, and eggs. The entire garrison's self-sufficiency rate for vegetables is over 90%. The spirited and strong island guards train vigorously on the training ground, presenting a lively scene. When talking about the changes in the unit's diet, the soldiers always remember the General Secretary's warm care. Political instructor Zhang Xianfu said, "Although we are far from home, we always feel the warmth of the Party Central Committee and the people of our motherland."

　　总书记关心海岛战士生活
    新华社记者  吴东峰
    春节前夕，一封精美的贺年信从珠江口外万顷碧波中的桂山岛飞往北京中南海。守岛全体指战员在这封信里向党中央总书记赵紫阳报告了他们因地制宜开展农副业生产，增加收入，改善伙食的喜讯。
    那是去年农历除夕的上午，中共中央总书记赵紫阳兴致勃勃地登上桂山岛视察。他了解了海岛渔民开展网箱养鱼，增加收入的情况，又询问驻岛部队指战员的生活状况。营长、教导员实事求是地告诉总书记，部队生活不如海岛渔民。赵紫阳建议他们搞网箱养鱼，改善部队生活，并关照广东省、珠海市的领导同志在技术和资金方面给部队一些帮助，走军民共同富裕的道路。他在广州见到军区领导同志时，又提到桂山岛部队养鱼的事，希望军区能够支持一下，把海岛士兵的生活补上去。
    在军费不多、物价上涨的情况下如何保证基层部队生活水平不下降，这是近年来桂山岛守备营基层建设中的一个难题。赵紫阳总书记的建议给他们指出了一条新思路。４月初，广州军区司令员张万年指示军区后勤部、广东省军区领导专程上岛，会同有关专家一起调查论证，拨出专款扶持桂山岛守备营发展海水网箱养殖业。珠海市市长梁广大说，地方发展海岛经济离不开部队，部队搞网箱养鱼，我们一定大力支持。桂山镇政府给部队划出风浪小、日照好的水域，派出有经验的技术人员帮助部队组装网箱。桂山岛渔业联营公司帮助买进优良品种鱼苗。养鱼专业户手把手地向战士传授经验技术。
    一年过去，桂山岛守备营网箱养鱼初见成效。１８个网箱共投放了石斑鱼和尖尾鲈１．６万多尾。第一批商品鱼已投放市场。连队餐桌上肉、鱼、蛋不断。全营蔬菜自给率达９０％以上。精神饱满、身强力壮的海岛卫士在训练场上摸爬滚打，一派龙腾虎跃的景象。谈起守备营连队伙食上的变化，指战员们总忘不了总书记的亲切关怀。教导员张先富说，我们远离故乡，却时刻感受到党中央和祖国人民给予的温暖。
