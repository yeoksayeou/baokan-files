Yulin Region Achieves Bumper Harvest
Grain Production Exceeds 800 Million Kilograms for the First Time

	Xinhua News Agency, January 6th: In 1988, the grain production in Yulin Region of Shaanxi Province exceeded 800 million kilograms for the first time, surpassing the highest historical level of 747 million kilograms in 1984 by 63 million kilograms.

	Located in the border region, Yulin Region has a weak agricultural foundation, with most areas still relying on weather conditions for farming. In 1987, due to severe drought, the grain production was only 429 million kilograms. In 1988, this region achieved a bumper harvest in grain production, primarily due to favorable weather conditions. In addition, the grain planting area increased compared to the previous year, and the supply of fertilizers and agricultural films was relatively normal. Most importantly, the dryland farming technology, primarily consisting of level ditches and ridge-furrow planting, was widely promoted in a large area.

　　榆林地区去年喜获大丰收
    粮食总产首次逾８亿公斤
    本报讯  记者景险峰报道：１９８８年，陕西榆林地区粮食总产首次突破８亿公斤大关，比创历史最高水平的１９８４年的７．４７亿公斤，净增０．６３亿公斤。
    地处塞外的榆林地区，农业基础薄弱，大部分地方还没有摆脱“靠天吃饭”的局面。１９８７年由于大旱，粮食产量仅４．２９亿公斤。１９８８年这个地区粮食生产获得大丰收，首先得益于风调雨顺。除此而外，粮食种植面积较上年有所增加，化肥、农用地膜的供应比较正常。特别是，以水平沟和沟垄种植为主要形式的旱作农业技术，在较大范围得到推广。
