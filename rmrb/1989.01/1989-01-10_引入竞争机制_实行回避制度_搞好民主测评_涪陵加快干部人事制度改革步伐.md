The Communist Party of China's Fuling City Committee and the Municipal Government have introduced competitive mechanisms for selecting cadres, implemented an avoidance system for cadre management, and emphasized democratic evaluations for cadre assessments, effectively accelerating the pace of cadre personnel system reform.

Fuling City's new framework for cadre personnel system reform is taking shape:

	— From identifying talent to competing on the field. The Municipal Committee has proposed that competitive mechanisms must be introduced into the selection and appointment of cadres, discovering talents through competition. It is understood that the selection and appointment of cadres in Fuling City is transitioning from a single appointment system to a combination of selection, recruitment, examination, and appointment systems. In addition to party and government cadres, so far, Fuling City has publicly recruited 645 factory managers, 127 district education commission directors and school principals, and all township-level leaders have implemented public recruitment.

	— Implementing an avoidance and supervision system for cadres. Fuling City has implemented an avoidance system for cadres, including three aspects: First, term rotation, stipulating that district and township (town) level party and government leaders implement term rotation, and the longest consecutive term in one place should not exceed three terms (each term is three years). Second, inter-district rotation, new district and township level party and government cadres in Fuling City are no longer assigned to their hometowns. It is reported that the original ones will also be adjusted, and this year, 34 district and township cadres will undergo inter-district rotation. Third, implementing avoidance, if the person to be appointed or dismissed is a relative, the leader should voluntarily avoid involvement; if relatives and close relatives of party and government cadres at all levels work in the same unit, the one with the lower position should be transferred out of the unit. It is reported that currently, Fuling City has 14 cadres who have implemented avoidance according to regulations, including 8 department-level cadres whose spouses and children working in the same unit have been transferred out.

	— Implementing a democratic evaluation system for annual work of leading cadres. Recently, Fuling City has dismissed four deputy department-level and above cadres who did not receive more than half of the public's votes of confidence. For three leaders who received more than half of the votes but had significant public opinions, after analyzing the reasons, they were shown a yellow card warning. The public commented: "The reform is really serious."

　　引入竞争机制　实行回避制度　搞好民主测评
    涪陵加快干部人事制度改革步伐
    本报讯  记者陈华报道：中共四川省涪陵市委和市政府选用干部引入竞争机制，干部管理实行回避监督，干部考核注重民主测评，有效地加快了干部人事制度改革的步伐。
    涪陵市干部人事制度改革的新格局已初具雏型：
    ——变伯乐识马为沙场赛马。市委提出必须把竞争机制引入干部的选拔任用，在沙场赛马中发现人才。据了解，涪陵市干部的任用选拔正在由单一的委任制向选任制、招聘制、考任制、委任制等多种形式相结合的选拔制转变。除党政干部外，到目前为止，涪陵市已公开招聘厂长经理６４５人，区教委主任、学校校长１２７人，乡级领导干部也都全部实行了公开招聘。
    ——实行干部的回避、监督制度。涪陵市对干部实行了包括三方面内容的回避制度：一是任期交流，规定区乡（镇）两级党政主要领导干部实行任期交流，连续任职在一个地方最长不得超过３届（每届３年）。二是异地交流，涪陵市新提拔的区乡两级主要党政干部已经不再在本乡本土安排。据有关人士透露，原有的也将加以调整，今年将有３４位区乡干部进行异地交流。三是实行回避，如任免对象与自己是亲属关系的，该领导同志要主动回避；凡党政机关各级干部的亲属及近亲、姻亲在同一单位工作的应将其职务较低的一方调离该单位。据悉，现在涪陵市已有１４位干部按规定实行回避，其中８位局级干部在同一单位工作的爱人、子女都已经调离。
    ——实行领导干部年度工作的民主测评制度。前不久在涪陵市已对群众测评信任票不过半的４位副局级以上干部作了就地免职处理，对３位信任票过半但群众意见较大的领导干部，分析原因后，向他们出示了黄牌警告。群众反映说：“改革确实动了真格的。”
