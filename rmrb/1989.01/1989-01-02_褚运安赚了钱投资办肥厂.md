Chu Yun'an Uses Earnings to Invest in Fertilizer Factory

    Xinhua News Agency reports: After several years of operation, Wuhan individual entrepreneur Chu Yun'an has accumulated nearly 10 million yuan. What to do with this money? He thought of the difficulty farmers face in purchasing fertilizer and decided to invest 7 million yuan to establish a fertilizer factory in Wuhan in collaboration with Australian and Hong Kong businesspeople. The factory, named Step Cloud En Fertilizer Limited Company, has an annual production capacity of nearly 20,000 liters.

    Li Xiannian, in a report, said that Chu Yun'an's investment in the agricultural industry is forward-thinking. Establishing a fertilizer factory is welcomed by farmers, increases grain production, and benefits the country and its people.

    En fertilizer is a long-acting, compound, new-type fertilizer invented by Americans. Each acre requires only 70 milliliters, which can increase yield by 10-50%. It is known as the "soil nutrition essence" with no pollution, disease resistance, disaster resistance, and soil improvement. It can also increase the protein content of grains by 2.5% and vitamins by 80%.

    This type of fertilizer is widely used in North America and Oceania. In 1984, at the International Agricultural Technology Exchange Conference held in Guangzhou, En fertilizer was introduced to China. To establish the En fertilizer factory, Chu Yun'an made seven trips to Hong Kong and four trips to Beijing, completing the production technology feasibility study and reaching a joint venture production and operation agreement with foreign businesspeople. At the same time, he purchased land, introduced equipment, and arranged for personnel training. After intense construction, the factory quickly went into full production, with products fully meeting international standards. After being released to the market, it was well-received by farmers. Now, Chu Yun'an plans to build another En fertilizer factory in Yunmeng County, Hubei.

　　褚运安赚了钱投资办肥厂
    本报讯  武汉市个体户褚运安经过几年的经营，积累近千万元资金。这笔钱怎样用呢？他想到农民买化肥难的问题，毅然拿出７００万元，与澳大利亚和香港企业家合资在武汉办起年产近２万升的步云恩肥有限公司。李先念同志在一次听汇报时说，褚运安敢于向有关农业产业投资，很有眼光。办化肥厂，农民欢迎，增产粮食，利国利民。
    恩肥是美国人发明的长效复合新型肥料，每亩实用７０毫升，可增产１０—５０％，被誉为土壤营养精，无污染，能抗病抗灾，改良土壤，并且可以使谷物蛋白质提高２．５％、维生素提高８０％。
    这种肥料在北美和大洋洲已广泛使用，１９８４年在广州召开国际农业技术交流会，恩肥被介绍到我国。褚运安为兴办恩肥厂，七去香港，四上北京，完成了生产技术可行性调查，与外商达成合资生产经营协议。与此同时，还购买了地皮、引进了设备，安排了人员培训。经过紧张施工，工厂很快全面投产，产品完全符合国际标准。投放市场后，深受农民欢迎。现在褚运安计划在湖北云梦县再建一座恩肥厂。
