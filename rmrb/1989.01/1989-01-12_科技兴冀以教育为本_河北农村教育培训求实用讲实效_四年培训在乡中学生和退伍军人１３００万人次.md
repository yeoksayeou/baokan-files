The Hebei Provincial Party Committee and Government are currently brainstorming ways to "ensure a bumper harvest this year." Recently, they invited over 100 officials from various departments, including the provincial science and technology associations, youth leagues, women's federations, education commissions, and agricultural departments, to gather in Tangshan. The purpose was to clarify the strategic thinking of "technology revitalizing Hebei" and "education as the foundation."

Officials in Hebei believe that there are significant contradictions in current agricultural production. Apart from issues such as a large population, limited land, insufficient funds, and scarce water resources, there is also a stark contrast: while the demand for agricultural products is surging, agricultural output is insufficient. Agricultural production must quickly modernize, but farmers generally have low scientific and cultural literacy. At the same time, every year, a large number of junior and senior high school graduates in rural areas are unable to advance to higher levels of education. Only about 20% of high school graduates can continue their studies, while the remaining 80% become "rural students." These young people, who have only received ordinary high school education, generally lack practical production knowledge and skills. Additionally, Hebei Province has a large number of demobilized soldiers returning to their hometowns each year. If technical training—referred to as "in-service training"—is provided to them, enabling each person to master one or two practical skills, and then through them, spreading advanced and applicable production technologies to other farmers, this would be a beneficial measure to resolve current agricultural production contradictions. Otherwise, it would result in a significant waste of talent—just the waste of educational investments is considerable. It is estimated that raising a high school graduate requires an average investment of 3,000 yuan from the state and local governments.

Since 1984, Hebei Province has adopted multi-channel, multi-level, and multi-form educational methods. It has already provided technical training to 13 million rural students and demobilized soldiers returning to their hometowns.

Those who have received training not only promoted the development of the rural economy but also made significant contributions to the construction of both material and spiritual civilization in rural areas. According to incomplete statistics, some trained rural students and demobilized soldiers, after becoming prosperous, helped impoverished households with 500,000 labor days last year alone. They also donated 1.22 million yuan to public welfare projects such as education, road construction, bridge building, and well digging.

Why do ordinary schools have students dropping out, while "in-service training" is so full of vitality? This seems to be a challenge to China's original education system. A student from the vocational and technical school in Fengnan County's Kuāzi Village said, "After graduating from high school, I didn't get into college. I worked in a town-owned enterprise, and later the factory sent me to this two-year college-level class for training. They paid me a salary and even gave me a scholarship, so of course, we have to study hard." This student's thoughts are representative. "In-service training" gives rural youth a sense of direction, even making regular college students envious.

Why are rural areas willing to invest in "in-service training"? An official from one of the main organizing units of this work, the provincial science and technology association, said, "The places that are most willing to invest money and effort are where the officials are wise and far-sighted." Fengnan County's Kuāzi Village, which has done an excellent job in "in-service training," has come to this conclusion: "Intellectual investment is the most direct, effective, and economical productive investment, and it is a long-term investment." This village started a vocational and technical school in 1984, with classes for junior college and undergraduate levels. Adhering to the "three practical" principles of "practical, useful, and effective," they have trained over 5,400 enterprise workers and farmers over the years. With so many talents injected into the fields and factories of this village, what will be the result? The fact is: the average grain yield in Kuāzi Village has reached over 400 kilograms per mu, a 72% increase from 1978; the total output value of township enterprises has increased from 800,000 yuan in 1978 to over 60 million yuan now, and per capita income has increased more than tenfold compared to 1978.

　　科技兴冀以教育为本
    河北农村教育培训求实用讲实效
    四年培训在乡中学生和退伍军人１３００万人次
    本报讯  记者王溪元报道：河北省委、省政府正在为“争取今年农业丰收”动脑筋，最近邀请各地科协、团委、妇联、教委、农业等部门１００多位干部聚集唐山，明确“科技兴冀”、“教育为本”的战略思想。
    河北省的同志认为，当前农业生产存在很大矛盾，除人多、地少、资金少、水资源少之外，还面临着这样的反差现象：对农产品需求猛增而农业产出不足，农业生产必须尽快实现现代化而农民科学文化水平普遍较低。与此同时，广大农村每年有大批初中、高中毕业生升不上高一级学校，高中毕业生能升学的只占毕业生总数的２０％左右，而另外的８０％则成为“在乡中学生”。这些仅受过普通中学教育的青年，普遍缺少实际生产的知识和能力。此外，河北全省每年还有大批退伍军人回到家乡。如果对他们进行技术培训——即“在培”，使每个人掌握一两项实用技术，再通过他们把先进适用的生产技术辐射到其他农民中去，显然是解决当前农业生产矛盾的有益之举。否则，将是一种巨大的人才浪费——仅教育投资的浪费就十分可观。据测算，培养一个中学毕业生，国家和地方平均要投资３０００元。
    自１９８４年以来，河北省采用多渠道、多层次、多形式的办学方法，已对各地在乡中学生和回乡退伍军人进行技术培训１３００万人次。
    受过培训的人员，不仅促进了农村经济的发展，而且为农村两个文明建设做出了重要贡献。据不完全统计，一些经过培训的在乡中学生和回乡退伍军人，自家富起来后，仅去年一年就为贫困户帮工５０多万个，为社会办教育、修路、建桥、打井等公益事业捐款１２２万多元。
    为什么普通学校不断有人退学，而“在培”工作又这样具有生命力呢？这好像正是对我国原有教育体制提出的挑战。丰南县侉子庄镇技术学校大专班的一位学员说：“我高中毕业后没有考上大学，进了镇办企业，后来工厂送我到这个二年制的大专班来培训，给工资，还有奖学金，我们当然得好好学。”这位学员的想法具有代表性。“在培”使在乡青年觉得有奔头，甚至使正规大学的学生眼馋。
    为什么农村肯出钱搞“在培”呢？这项工作的主办单位之一——省科协的干部说得好：“凡是最肯出钱出力的地方，那里的干部都是精明、有远见的。”“在培”工作搞得很出色的丰南县侉子庄镇就得出了这样的结论：“智力投资是最直接最有效最经济的生产性投资，是长远起作用的投资。”这个镇从１９８４年办起了职业技术学校，分别设有中技班和大专班。他们本着“实际、实用、实效”的“三实”原则，几年来培训了企业职工和务农劳力５４００多人。一个镇有这么多人才充实到农田和工厂，结果会怎样呢？事实是：侉子庄镇粮食平均单产已达４００多公斤，比１９７８年增长了７２％；乡镇企业的总产值，由１９７８年的８０万元增加到现在的６０００多万元，人均收入比１９７８年提高了１０倍多。
