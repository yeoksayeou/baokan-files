Title: A Wave of Corporate Mergers Sweeps Canada

The beginning of the new year saw three significant corporate mergers in Canada within just three days. On January 18, Canada's second and third largest breweries announced their merger, forming the country's largest brewery. The deal was worth 1.6 billion Canadian dollars. On January 19, Canada's third largest airline, Wardair, was acquired by the second largest, Canadian Pacific Airlines, for 248 million Canadian dollars. On January 20, Canada's largest oil company, Imperial Oil, bought the country's fourth largest, Dome Petroleum, for 4.9 billion Canadian dollars.

The total value of these three mergers amounted to 6.7 billion Canadian dollars, with the 4.9 billion dollar oil merger setting a record as the second-largest in Canadian corporate history. Given that these mergers occurred in three important economic sectors, they immediately drew public attention.

The federal government has taken a cautious stance on these three mergers. The government has a dedicated department that oversees merger policies, ensuring that mergers both enhance corporate efficiency and rationality and do not harm market competition. The head of this department stated that they are conducting a thorough investigation into these three mergers. Meanwhile, the opposition Liberal Party and New Democratic Party have criticized these activities, linking them to the implementation of the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement. Federal government officials have strongly denied this.

Most economists believe that mergers are an inevitable trend, and that Canada's economy must engage in mergers to enhance its competitiveness on the global stage. Some have metaphorically described mergers as "big fish eating small fish," noting that Canada's big fish are merely small fish in the global market.

Statistics show that Canada currently has about 350,000 companies of various types, with the largest 25 controlling 35% of the nation's corporate assets. Despite this, none of Canada's companies appeared on the list of the world's 50 largest companies published by the American magazine *Fortune* last year. It is said that there are currently about 100 companies worldwide with assets exceeding $40 billion, while Canada has only 10 companies with assets exceeding $4 billion. This is a major reason why proponents advocate for continued mergers.

Analysts point to several main reasons for the intensifying corporate competition and increasing mergers: first, the government's policy of reducing economic intervention. Second, from an international perspective, the strengthening trend of globalization in production and sales forces companies to merge to survive in global competition, and this is especially true for Canada, which heavily relies on foreign trade and faces the challenge of a unified North American market.

Undoubtedly, mergers can strengthen corporate competitiveness, but on the other hand, economists also worry that excessive mergers could lead to monopolies. Once monopolies form, the competitive mechanisms that drive production will inevitably weaken, and in the end, consumers will suffer. Those who support mergers do not deny the possibility of price increases for airline tickets and gasoline, nor the estimated 2,000 job losses in the brewery industry, with some breweries already announcing closures. Wardair, the acquired airline, is expected to lay off one-third of its employees.

### 加拿大企业兼并风潮迭起

　　加拿大企业兼并风潮迭起
    本报记者  郭文福
    新年伊始，加拿大３天内连续发生三起重要的企业兼并事件。１月１８日，加拿大第二大和第三大啤酒公司决定合并，从而组成了加拿大第一大啤酒公司，这笔交易额达１６亿加元。１月１９日，加拿大全国第三大航空公司——华德航空公司被第二大航空公司——加拿大国际航空公司以２．４８亿加元买走。１月２０日，加拿大最大的帝国石油公司，又以４９亿加元巨款买下了居全国同行业第４位的加拿大德士古石油公司。
    ３笔兼并的总金额达６７亿多加元，其中４９亿加元的石油吞并额，在加拿大企业兼并史上创下数额第二的纪录。由于兼并活动连续发生在３个重要的经济领域，因此立即引起了人们的关注。
    联邦政府对这三起兼并活动持慎重态度。联邦政府设有专门负责兼并政策的部门，其主要职能是审查兼并活动，使之既有利于提高企业的效率和合理性，又不损害市场的竞争机制。该部门的负责人称，正在对这三起兼并进行严格的调查。与此同时，反对党自由党和新民主党都对此提出批评，认为这些活动的产生同加美自由贸易协定的实施有关，联邦政府的官员则断然否认。
    多数经济专家认为，兼并是一种必然的趋势，加拿大经济要想参与世界性竞争必须兼并以提高竞争能力。有人形象地说，兼并就是大鱼吃小鱼，而加拿大的大鱼到了世界市场上只是一条小鱼。
    据统计，加拿大目前约有各类企业３５万个，其中最大的２５家控制了全国企业资产的３５％。尽管如此，美国《幸福》杂志去年公布的世界最大的５０家公司中，加拿大公司榜上无名。据说，目前世界上拥有资产在４００亿美元以上的大跨国公司已有约１００家，而加拿大资产在４０亿以上的公司才只有１０家，这就是主张继续兼并者的一个主要原因。
    据分析，企业竞争加剧和兼并日益增多的主要原因有以下几个方面：首先是政府奉行对经济减少干预的结果。其次，从国际环境看，生产和销售国际化趋势的加强，迫使企业必须联合才能在国际竞争中生存，而对于主要依赖外贸而又面临统一的北美市场挑战的加拿大来说情况更是如此。
    无疑，兼并有利于加强企业的竞争力，但另一方面，经济专家也担心，兼并过分会形成垄断，而垄断一旦形成，推动生产的竞争机制就必然会削弱，届时广大消费者也会受害。持支持态度的人也不否认飞机票和汽油有涨价的可能，啤酒业估计有２０００多人失业，一些啤酒厂已宣布关闭。被兼并的华德航空公司预计有１／３的职员将被裁减。
