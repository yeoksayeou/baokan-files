The head of the China Social Welfare Prize-Drawing Fundraising Committee revealed today that there are a few individuals in society who are using prize-drawing fundraising activities for illegal and criminal purposes, which has had a negative impact. To this end, the committee will strengthen the management of lottery ticket sales and funds, enhance social supervision, and eliminate and prevent illegal activities.

In 1988, the committee, in collaboration with local audit departments, strengthened internal management and supervision, and there were no instances of misappropriation, embezzlement, or misuse of welfare funds. However, during the issuance of lottery tickets, there were indeed a few individuals who acted recklessly. In one instance, a school principal in a certain location purchased social welfare lottery tickets for the teachers, kept the winning numbers for himself, and distributed the non-winning tickets to others. After the incident was exposed, the principal was subjected to disciplinary action by the Party and the government.

The committee's head stated that, according to typical investigations, the mindset of lottery ticket purchasers can be categorized into three types: 10% of people purchase tickets to support social welfare causes, 70% of people buy tickets for the thrill of chance and do not particularly care about winning or losing, and approximately 10% of people have a gambler's mentality, with some even causing disturbances if they do not win. Therefore, in the future issuance of lottery tickets, the committee will work with public security, audit, and disciplinary inspection departments to promptly and seriously handle various illegal and criminal activities.

　　加强有奖募捐监督
    社会福利有奖募捐委员会负责人重申纪律
    本报北京１月１２日讯  中国社会福利有奖募捐委员会负责人今天透露，社会上有少数人利用有奖募捐活动进行违法犯罪，造成了不良影响。为此，募委会将加强奖券销售和资金管理，强化社会监督，以杜绝和避免违法现象的发生。
    １９８８年，募委会同各地审计部门，加强内部管理监督，没有出现挪用、贪污、占用福利资金等现象。但是，在发行奖券过程中，确有极少数人胡作非为。某地一所学校校长给教师们购买了社会福利奖券后，抽出获奖的号码留给自己，把没有获奖的奖券发给别人。事发后，这位校长受到了党政纪律处分。
    募委会负责人说，据典型调查，购买奖券者的心态，主要有三种，１０％的人是为了支持社会福利事业，７０％的人是碰碰运气，是否中奖，并不在乎，只有约１０％的人怀有赌徒心理，有的甚至中不了奖就闹事。因此，募委会在今后的奖券发行中，对各种违法犯罪活动，将配合公安、审计、纪律检查部门及时进行严肃处理。
