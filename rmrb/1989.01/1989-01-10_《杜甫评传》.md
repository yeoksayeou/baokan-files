Title: A Biography of Du Fu
Author: Zhu Qi
Date: 1989-01-10
Edition: 8

In 1982, Professor Chen Yixian's "A Biography of Du Fu" (Volume 1) was published and quickly sold out. Six years later, the middle and lower volumes were also published by Shanghai Ancient Books Publishing House. This massive work combines research, analysis, interpretation, and translation, using over a million words to chronicle the life of Du Fu.

Professor Chen Yixian's study of classical literature emphasizes both textual research, meaning, and rhetoric, as well as the era, the author, and the work. He seeks to understand the intentions of ancient authors and to analyze their works within the context of their times, striving to present ancient authors as living, breathing individuals. He traces Du Fu's movements through a wealth of poetry and historical records, exploring the relationship between Du Fu's life, his emotional state, and his creative output. Not only does he accurately depict Du Fu's life journey, but he also delicately captures Du Fu's emotional states during different periods of his life. The author has previously written novels and enjoys storytelling, so his writing is lively and fluent, full of wit and humor.

　　《杜甫评传》
    １９８２年，陈贻焮教授的《杜甫评传》上卷问世，很快售空。六年后，中、下卷也由上海古籍出版社出版了。这部巨帙融考证、论述、解析和翻译为一体，以百万字为杜甫一生作传。
    陈贻焮研究古典文学既重考据、义理、辞章，又重时代、作家、作品，以意逆志，知人论世，尽可能地把古代作家还原为活生生的人。他从大量的诗作和史料中寻觅杜甫的行踪，探索杜甫的生活、心境与其创作的关系，不但准确地勾勒出杜甫一生的人生历程，而且细腻地把握杜甫各个时期的心境意绪。作者早年曾创作过小说，平素又喜笑谈，所以他的文笔活泼畅达，风趣幽默。
