Farmers from Tangshan Revive a Batch of Enterprises

	Xinhua News Agency reports: Correspondent Chen Guoqing reports: Farmers from Tangshan City, Hebei Province, have entered state-owned and collective enterprises that were on the brink of collapse, taking on leadership roles. Over the past two years, they have helped 9 enterprises overcome their difficulties and turn losses into profits. Among these, 7 enterprises exceeded their contracted production and profit targets by more than 50% last year.

	The secret to their success is the direct introduction of the management mechanisms of township enterprises into state-owned and collective enterprises. In areas such as personnel, distribution, and operations, they have adopted flexible measures in accordance with relevant national policies. For example, clothing specialist Wang Zheming leased and operated the Tangshan Sixth Garment Factory. Originally, the factory was struggling, and workers were on extended leave. Wang Zheming worked tirelessly, repeatedly visiting Tianjin to gather foreign trade information, and secured 137,000 pieces of foreign trade orders for the enterprise last year, quickly turning the factory from a loss to a profit.

	In terms of management and rewards and punishments, these entrepreneurs emphasize the word "strict." Li Zhi took over the management of the Shunhua County Tractor Repair and Maintenance Factory, implementing a 55-item management responsibility system directly linked to wages and bonuses. He established four networks for material supply, economic accounting, material consumption, and quality inspection. By September of last year, the factory had completed its annual contracted plan.

　　唐山农民救活一批企业
    本报讯  记者陈国琦报道：河北唐山市一批农民企业家走进身陷绝境的国营、集体企业，担任领导，２年多来使９个企业摆脱困境，扭亏为盈，其中７个企业去年产值、利润分别超过承包指标的５０％以上。
    他们使这些企业起死回生的灵丹妙药，是把乡镇企业的经营机制直接带进国营、集体企业。在用人、分配、经营等环节上按照国家的有关政策，采取灵活的变通措施。服装专业户王哲明租赁经营的唐山市第六服装厂，原来工厂吃不饱，工人放长假。王哲明不辞劳苦，多次到天津捕捉外贸信息，去年为企业争取到外贸订货１３．７万件，迅速摘掉了亏损帽子。
    在管理和奖惩上，这批企业家讲究一个“严”字。李志承包遵化县拖拉机修配厂，制定了与工资奖金直接挂钩的５５条经营管理责任制，建立了物料供应、经济核算、材料消耗、质量检验等４个网络，到去年９月份就完成了全年承包计划。
