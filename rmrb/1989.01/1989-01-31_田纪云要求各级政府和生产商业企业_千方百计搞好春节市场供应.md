Vice Premier Tian Jiyun emphasized that all levels of government and production and commercial enterprises must take effective measures to do everything possible to ensure a good supply of goods for the Spring Festival market, so that the people can celebrate the New Year happily.

To further arrange the supply of goods for the Spring Festival market, Vice Premier Tian Jiyun held a meeting with the managers of eight major department stores and food markets in Beijing at the Beijing Longevity Commercial Building this morning.

Tian Jiyun first extended New Year greetings to all the staff in the commercial and service sectors in Beijing and across the country, and expressed his gratitude to the commercial staff who insisted on working on the front line during the festival.

Tian Jiyun pointed out that ensuring a good supply of goods for the Spring Festival market is not only necessary but also feasible. The situation of agricultural production last year was better than originally expected, industrial production has been developing steadily, and the implementation of rectification and regulation measures has begun to show results. These all provide favorable conditions for ensuring a good supply of goods for the Spring Festival market. All localities and relevant departments should not only ensure a good supply of goods for the Spring Festival market but also for the market after the Spring Festival.

After listening to the reports on the organization and supply of goods for the Spring Festival by units such as the Beijing Longevity Commercial Building, Xidan Market, and the Beijing Department Store, Tian Jiyun encouraged their work and made the following requirements for ensuring a good supply of goods for the Spring Festival market:

First, actively organize the supply of goods to make the varieties and quantities of goods more abundant. The "basket of vegetables" must be ensured first, and the supply of necessary daily industrial products must be guaranteed and cannot be out of stock. The supply of small commodities must be ensured, and as many high-end consumer goods as possible should be organized to meet the needs of different consumer levels.

Second, strictly implement the price policy to maintain basic price stability. For goods with state-set prices, they must be strictly implemented; for goods with price limits, they cannot exceed the limit; for goods with liberalized prices, they must also be reasonably priced. In this regard, state-owned enterprises must take the lead. The rate of price increases this year must be significantly lower than the target for last year, and every effort must be made to achieve this.

Third, strive to do a good job in service work. It is necessary to advocate for enthusiastic service. It is necessary to give certain material incentives for doing a good job in service work, but it is not possible to do without spirit.

　　田纪云要求各级政府和生产商业企业    
    千方百计搞好春节市场供应
    据新华社北京１月３０日电  国务院副总理田纪云强调，各级政府和生产、商业企业，要采取有力措施，千方百计做好春节商品供应工作，让人民高高兴兴度新春佳节。
    为了进一步安排好春节市场供应工作，田纪云副总理今天上午在北京市隆福大厦召开北京市八大百货、副食品商店经理座谈会。
    田纪云首先向北京市和全国商业服务业系统的全体职工拜早年，向节日坚持在第一线服务的商业职工表示慰问。
    田纪云指出，搞好春节市场供应不仅是必须的，而且也是有条件的，是可能的。去年农业生产情况比原来预料的要好，工业生产持续发展，贯彻治理、整顿措施，已开始取得成效，这都为安排好春节市场供应提供了有利条件。各地和有关部门不仅要做好春节市场供应，而且春节以后的市场供应也要搞好。
    在听取了北京市隆福大厦、西单菜市场和北京市百货大楼等单位春节商品组织、供应情况介绍后，田纪云对他们的工作给予鼓励并对做好春节市场供应工作提出以下要求：第一，积极组织货源，使商品花色、品种更丰富些，数量更多些。“菜篮子”首先要确保，日用工业必需品要保证供应，不能脱销，小商品供应要搞好，同时要尽量多组织一些高档消费品，满足不同消费层次的需要。第二，一定要严格执行物价政策，保持物价基本稳定。凡是国家定价的，必须严格执行；规定限价的，不能超过；价格放开的，也要合理定价。在这方面，国营企业必须起带头作用。今年物价上升幅度要明显低于去年的目标，一定要千方百计去实现。第三，努力做好服务工作。要提倡热情服务。搞好服务工作，给予一定物质鼓励是必要的，但不能没有精神。
