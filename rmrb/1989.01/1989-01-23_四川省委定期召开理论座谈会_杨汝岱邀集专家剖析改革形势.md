Recently, a group of theoretical and news workers from Sichuan Province, totaling over 30 people, were invited by Yang Ruidai, the provincial party secretary, to discuss the current situation of rectification and restructuring.

To improve the level of ideological understanding, to explore from a theoretical height the new problems arising from the reform, and to seek the correct path for rectification and restructuring, the Sichuan Provincial Committee has established a bimonthly theoretical discussion meeting. The recent meeting was the third one and also the one with the largest number of participants.

The discussion meeting did not avoid real problems, opened up thoughts, and everyone expressed their views. The participants discussed how to view the problems that have emerged in the current economic reform, where the solution lies, and whether the guiding ideology of the 10-year reform is practical theory or "blind groping."

Professor Liu Shibai, president of Southwest University of Finance and Economics, believes that the 10-year reform cannot be considered a "blind groping" without theoretical guidance. There is a sentiment and a trend worth noting: too much attention is paid to the negative aspects of the reform, and there are too many criticisms. It seems that the reform is completely useless. He proposed that China's inflation is more a result of the failure to match the opening of the mechanism with the constraint mechanism rather than a mistake in certain policies of the reform. The way to solve the problem is not to return to the old system but to deepen the reform.

Professor Lin Ling, vice president of the Sichuan Academy of Social Sciences, believes that the establishment of the theory of socialist commodity economy is not easy. Through 10 years of reform, the transition from product economy to commodity economy, and from vertical connections to horizontal connections, is a great success. The current rectification and restructuring is a necessary stage of the reform, an essential part, and not an external factor. Rectification and restructuring cannot deviate from the direction of reform; rectification and restructuring must serve the reform and create a reasonable economic structure. Rectification and restructuring cannot use any means to return to the old system. Now everything is being monopolized, which is a trend worth noting.

Professor Kang Dian, vice president of the Sichuan Provincial Party School, who is engaged in philosophical research, said that the current task of the ideological and propaganda front is to help the masses eliminate two kinds of interference: one is that reform is not as good as no reform, and the other is that only private ownership and capitalism can save China. Both views are untenable. It seems that we need to have a re-recognition of the national conditions.

At the meeting, everyone put forward many beneficial suggestions on how to rectify and restructure the current inflation, unfair distribution, chaotic economic order, as well as investment expansion and overconsumption.

Yang Ruidai said at the end of the meeting that the opinions and suggestions put forward by the theoretical workers at the meeting are very helpful to the decision-making of the provincial committee. He hopes that everyone will, in different positions, through their own work, push the reform forward, and expressed that such discussion meetings will continue to be held in the future.

　　四川省委定期召开理论座谈会    
    杨汝岱邀集专家剖析改革形势
    本报成都１月２２日电  本报记者罗茂城、新华社记者黄昌禄报道：最近，四川省一批理论工作者和新闻工作者３０余人应省委书记杨汝岱的邀请，就当前治理整顿的形势进行座谈。
    为提高思想认识水平，从理论高度探讨改革中出现的一些新问题，寻求治理整顿的正确途径，四川省委建立了双月理论座谈会制度。最近举行的座谈会是第三次，也是参加人数最多的一次。
    座谈会不回避现实问题，敞开思想，各抒己见。与会者围绕如何看待当前经济改革中出现的问题，解决问题的出路何在，以及１０年改革的指导思想是实践论还是“瞎摸论”等问题，发表了见解。
    西南财经大学校长刘诗白教授认为，１０年改革，不能认为是一场没有理论指导的“瞎摸”。现在有一股情绪、一种思潮值得注意，就是对改革的消极面看得过多、过重，过头责难多，似乎改革一无是处。他提出，中国的通货膨胀与其说是改革中某些政策的失误，不如说是放开机制和约束机制没有配套改革的结果。解决问题的出路，不是向旧体制复归，而是靠深化改革。
    四川省社会科学院副院长林凌教授认为，社会主义商品经济理论的确立来之不易。通过１０年改革，从产品经济转向商品经济，从纵向联系转向横向联系，这是一个很大的成功。当前的治理整顿，是改革的必然阶段，是题中应有之义，并不是外在之物。治理整顿，不能违背改革方向；治理整顿要服从于改革，整出一个合理的经济结构来。治理整顿，不能不择手段，又回到旧的体制上去。现在什么都搞专卖，这是一个值得注意的动向。
    从事哲学研究的四川省委党校副校长康电教授说，当前思想、宣传战线的任务，是帮助群众排除两方面的干扰：一是认为改革还不如不改革，一是认为只有私有制、资本主义才能救中国。这两种观点都是站不住脚的。看来，我们有必要对国情来一个再认识。
    会上，大家对如何治理整顿当前通货膨胀、分配不公、经济秩序混乱，以及投资膨胀、消费过热等问题提出了许多有益的建议。
    杨汝岱在座谈会结束时说，理论工作者在会上发表的意见和提出的建议，对省委决策很有帮助。他希望大家在不同的岗位上，通过各自的工作，把改革推向前进，并表示这样的座谈会今后将继续举行。
