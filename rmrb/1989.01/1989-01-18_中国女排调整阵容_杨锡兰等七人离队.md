　　中国女排调整阵容
    杨锡兰等七人离队
    据新华社北京１月１６日电  （记者李贺普、薛剑英）中国国家女子排球队在确定了主教练和教练之后，又开始了对运动员阵容的调整。国家体委训练局副局长张蓉芳今天在这里宣布，杨锡兰、郑美珠、侯玉珠、姜英、杨晓君、汪亚君和赵红７名队员离队。
    队员苏惠娟、巫丹、李月明、李国君和崔咏梅将留下来加入调整后的国家女排新阵容。
    中国女排今天下午在训练局大楼会议室举行了欢送会。即将离队的杨锡兰等７名队员和李耀先、董传强、程蜀琦三名教练员回顾近两年来的历程。
    这是中国女排自１９７６年以来最大的一次调整。这次调整是中国女排在奥运会失利以后进行的。参加今天欢送会的训练局的各位领导称赞女排老队员把自己的青春献给了排球事业，为中国女排夺得５连冠做出了贡献。教练员李耀先、董传强、程蜀琦在近两年的工作中付出了辛勤劳动。
    留下来的巫丹、苏惠娟、李月明在欢送会上表示，一定要继承和发扬中国女排的光荣传统，刻苦训练，把冠军早日夺回来。
