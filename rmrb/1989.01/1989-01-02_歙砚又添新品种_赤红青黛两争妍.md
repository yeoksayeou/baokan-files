The renowned She inkstone has seen the addition of two new varieties. She County's Shangfeng Crafts Factory, with the assistance of Engineer and inkstone research expert Cheng Mingming from the Anhui Provincial Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources' 332 Geological Team, has discovered two rare inkstone materials, Shehong (red) and Sheqing (indigo), in the local mountainous areas. The factory's trial production of Shehong and Sheqing inkstones has been well-received by calligraphers and painters.

She County is a significant production area for She inkstones. Last year, Cheng Mingming published the book "Research on Chinese She Inkstones." The Shangfeng Crafts Factory, which had incurred a loss of 170,000 yuan the previous year, sought his expertise. Cheng Mingming, using an ancient Qing Dynasty inkstone (inscribed by Wu Meitian) from the She County Museum as a clue, conducted scientific research and field investigations. Together with the factory director, Wang Man, they traversed mountains and valleys, ultimately discovering Shehong and Sheqing inkstones in the northern mountains of She County.

Shehong inkstone has a vibrant color, resembling pork liver or red beans, and is similar in texture to Duan inkstone. After being crafted into an inkstone, it has a fine and smooth texture, is firm yet releases ink well, retains water without drying out, and has a moderate hardness, making it an excellent inkstone material. Sheqing inkstone is a fine-grained sandstone, firm yet smooth, and produces a metallic sound when struck. It is found in the Nianguan Formation of the early Cambrian system, has a simple yet elegant pattern, does not absorb water, and enhances ink flow, making it an ideal inkstone material.

　　歙砚又添新品种
    赤红青黛两争妍
    本报讯  名传遐迩的歙砚又添两个新品种。歙县上丰工艺厂在安徽省地矿局３３２地质队工程师、砚石研究专家程明铭帮助下，在当地山区首次发现了罕见的歙红、歙青两种砚石材料。该厂试产的歙红、歙青砚台，深受书画家的欢迎。
    歙县是歙砚的重要产地。去年初，程明铭撰写的《中国歙砚研究》一书出版。前年亏损１．７万元的上丰工艺厂慕名求贤，请他帮助。程明铭即根据歙县博物馆收藏的一方清代古砚（吴梅颠铭砚）为线索，进行科学论证和考察研究，并与厂长汪满和一起翻山越岭，终于在歙北山区发现歙红、歙青两种砚石。
    歙红砚石颜色妍丽，呈猪肝、赤豆色，与端砚石质相似；成砚后，石质细腻滑润，坚而发墨，贮水不涸，且硬度适中，属上乘砚石原料。歙青砚石石质为含粉砂板岩，坚而润，敲之似有金属声，产于前震旦系牛屋组地层中，纹饰素艳，且不吸水，发墨益毫，也是一种理想的砚石材料。
