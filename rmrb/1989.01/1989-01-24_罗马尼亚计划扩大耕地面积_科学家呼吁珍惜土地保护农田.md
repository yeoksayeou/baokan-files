Romania plans to expand arable land
Scientists call for land conservation and farmland protection

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, January 22 (Reporter Zhang Hanwen) As Romania's arable land gradually decreases, the government has formulated plans and measures to further expand arable land, and scientists are strongly advocating for land conservation and land-saving efforts.

Currently, Romania's total arable land area has decreased by nearly 300,000 hectares compared to 1975. In September last year, the Romanian Communist Party Central Committee's agricultural work conference decided to impose stricter restrictions on industrial construction, residential construction, and other land uses, and to convert marshes, barren lands, and unused roads into arable land.

With the development of industrial construction and residential construction, the expansion of cities, and the exploitation of mines, Romania's arable land area has been gradually shrinking. The expansion of oil fields has led to land erosion and degradation, and large-scale open-pit coal mining has destroyed farmland.

In the rational development and utilization of land resources, each oil extraction area in Romania has formulated its own plans to prevent farmland pollution and protect ecological balance. Currently, oil workers have built small dikes around 60% of the wells to prevent sewage from flowing into the fields. The two largest open-pit coal mines, the Rovina Mine and the Motru Mine, have established special land management teams to restore 250 hectares of land for agricultural use.

Romanian scientists have emphasized the importance of farmland protection through various media and have conducted surveys of local land resources.

　　罗马尼亚计划扩大耕地面积    
    科学家呼吁珍惜土地保护农田
    新华社布加勒斯特１月２２日电（记者张汉文）在罗马尼亚耕地面积逐渐减少的情况下，政府制订出进一步扩大耕地面积的计划和措施，科学家们也大力呼吁要珍惜土地、节约土地。
    目前，罗马尼亚全国耕地面积比１９７５年减少了近３０万公顷。去年９月罗共中央农业工作会议决定对工业基本建设、住宅建设等占用农田作出更加严格的限制，并改造沼泽地、贫瘠土地、无用道路等办法增加耕地。
    随着工业建设和住宅建设的发展，城镇的扩大，矿山的开采，罗马尼亚耕地面积逐年有所缩小。油田的扩大造成了土地的被侵蚀和退化，大面积的露天煤矿开采破坏了农田。
    在合理开发和利用土地资源方面，罗马尼亚各采油区都定出了自己的防止污染农田、保护生态平衡的计划。目前采油工人在６０％的井架四周筑起了小堤坝防止污水流入田中。两个最大的露天煤矿罗维纳利矿和莫特鲁矿设立了专门负责土地的工作队，设法使２５０公顷土地还农复种。
    罗马尼亚科学家通过各种新闻媒介大力强调保护农田的重大意义，并对地方的土地资源进行普查。
