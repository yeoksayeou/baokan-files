The corruption occurring among a few individuals in the Party and state organs has become a serious issue hindering reform and modernization. Recently, the Central Secretariat held a special meeting to discuss the issue of building a clean government, proposing the major task of opposing corruption and maintaining integrity (see January 16 of this paper), which has been supported by the people across the country.

How can we effectively oppose corruption and maintain the integrity of the Party and state organs? The minutes of the Central Secretariat meeting proposed many powerful measures. One of the important measures is to strengthen public opinion supervision. Practice has proven that the power of public opinion is immense, and public opinion supervision is a highly effective anti-corruption measure.

Our public opinion is powerful because it maintains a close connection with the people, serving as an important channel for the people to exercise their rights as masters of the state and participate in politics. The power of public opinion is the power of the people. Relying on the power of the people to fight against corruption is the fundamental way to oppose corruption. Therefore, we must fully utilize news media to mobilize public opinion and the people to care about and oversee the clean government building of the Party and state organs, and to put forward various criticisms and suggestions. This is an essential part of developing socialist democratic politics.

Our public opinion is also powerful because it has the characteristics of openness and transparency. Fighting corruption through openness has been a proven and effective common experience in various places in recent years. Openness, importantly, involves institutional building and the practice of open administration. Its brilliance lies in bringing matters out into the open, thus providing a basic premise for eliminating dark corruption. As a mass communication medium, public opinion tools are one of the best open platforms. Through this openness, a strong deterrent force can be formed. The saying "I am not afraid of being reported, but I am afraid of being published in the newspaper" simply means that the degree of openness in newspaper publications is high.

An important content or means of public opinion supervision is to expose corruption. Will this cause people to lose confidence? The issue is not whether newspapers publish exposés, but whether the exposed facts are accurate and whether appropriate actions have been taken after the exposure. The basis of public opinion supervision should be facts, and the result of public opinion supervision should be to promote the resolution of problems. Of course, solving problems and handling cases is not the responsibility of public opinion, but the duty of relevant leading organs and law enforcement departments. These organs and departments should pay attention to public opinion supervision and should not ignore the corruption exposed by public opinion media, but should investigate and handle it seriously. Public opinion media should exercise their supervisory powers within the scope of the law, not interfere with the law enforcement process, and should actively report the handling results to ensure that public opinion supervision has a beginning and an end, rather than just reveling in exposing darkness. If we take such an attitude towards exposure, it will only show that we dare to face the dark side and have the determination to solve problems, which will increase the people's confidence. On the contrary, if we avoid the corruption that actually exists, the people can still see and feel it, which will only make them more discontented and lose confidence.

The responsibility of public opinion is not just to expose darkness, but also to propagate law and order, uphold justice, exchange experiences in building a clean government, and promote successful practices. Furthermore, in a broad sense, positively praising good deeds and good people is also a form of public opinion supervision. In the long run, fundamentally, our fight against corruption and for integrity must focus on institutional building, which is the key to long-term stability. Our propaganda work on clean government is generally good, but there are also areas that do not adapt to the needs of the changing situation, mainly that we are not very familiar with or accustomed to constructive elements, and in propaganda, we often overlook institutional factors, preferring to focus only on investigating cases and catching people. This is not to say that cases should not be investigated, nor is it to say that legal penalties should not be imposed on a very small number of seriously corrupt officials. Rather, it is to say that, relative to these measures, educating cadres and the masses about the law, especially about citizens' duties and rights, is also important, and even more foundational and far-reaching in significance. We must educate Party and state organ staff to have a sense of the law and a sense of being public servants, to learn to act according to the law and by the rules; we must educate the masses to understand how to protect their rights and to have a sense of institutional and supervisory awareness. This should be an important part of public opinion supervision.

To correctly play the role of public opinion supervision, we journalists must further enhance our sense of responsibility and legal awareness, and adhere to the principle of seeking truth from facts and a practical work style. This paper is willing to work with other news units to advance the work of public opinion supervision, and to do our best to maintain the integrity of the Party and state organs, build socialist democratic politics, and promote reform and modernization.

　　发挥舆论监督作用  与腐败现象作斗争
    本报评论员
    发生在党和国家机关少数人中的腐败现象，已经成为阻碍改革和现代化建设的严重问题。最近，中央书记处专门讨论了廉政建设问题，提出了反对腐败保持廉洁的重大任务（见１月１６日本报），得到了全国人民的拥护。
    怎样才能有效地反对腐败以保持党和国家机关的廉洁？中央书记处会议纪要中提出了许多条有力措施。其中重要的一条，就是要加强舆论监督。实践证明，舆论的力量很大，舆论监督是一种极有效力的防腐反腐剂。
    我们的舆论所以有力量，是因为它与人民群众保持着密切联系，是人民群众行使国家主人翁权利、参政议政的一条重要渠道。舆论的力量就是人民群众的力量。依靠人民的力量与腐败现象作斗争，是我们反对腐败的治本之法。因此，要充分利用新闻媒介，以动员舆论、动员人民关心和过问党和国家机关的廉政建设，提出各种批评和建议。这是我们发展社会主义民主政治的题中应有之义。
    我们的舆论所以有力量，还因为它具有公开、透明的特点。靠公开化与腐败现象作斗争，是近年来各地反腐败、抓廉政的一条行之有效的共同经验。公开化，很重要的一点，就是围绕制度建设、实行办事公开。它的高明之处就在于将事物拿到光天化日之下，这就在很大程度上为消除腐败阴暗现象提供了一个基本的前提。作为大众传播媒介，舆论工具是最好的公开场所之一。通过这种公开，可以形成很强大的威慑力量。所谓“不怕通报，就怕登报”，无非是因为登报的公开化程度高。
    舆论监督的一个重要内容或手段，是揭露腐败现象。这会不会使人丧失信心？这里的问题不在于报纸上登不登揭露性报道，而在于揭露的事实是不是准确，揭露之后是不是得到了应有的处理。舆论监督的依据应当是事实，舆论监督的结果应当是促进问题的解决。当然，解决问题、处理案件，不是舆论的事情，而是有关领导机关和执法部门的职责。这些机关和部门都应当重视舆论监督，对于舆论媒介公开揭露的腐败现象，不应置若罔闻，而要认真查办。舆论媒介则应在法律范围内行使监督权，不应干扰执法过程，并应当积极报道处理结果，使舆论监督有始有终，而不能仅以暴露阴暗为快事。如果用这样的态度来对待揭露，只会表明我们敢于正视阴暗面，解决问题有决心，群众会增加信心。反之，如果我们回避在事实上存在的腐败现象，群众还是能看得见、感觉到，那就会更有意见，以致失去信心。
    舆论的职责并不单单是揭露阴暗，还应当负起宣传法制、弘扬正气、交流廉政经验、推广成功做法等职责。另外，从广泛的意义上说，正面表扬一些好人好事，也是一种舆论监督。从长远看，从根本上说，我们反对腐败、保持廉洁的斗争，一定要把立足点和着眼点放到制度建设上来，这才是长治久安之计。我们的廉政舆论宣传工作总的是好的，但也有不能适应形势发展需要的地方，主要是不大熟悉、不大习惯建设性的东西，在宣传中对制度化因素往往容易忽略，而喜欢将目光仅仅放在查案、抓人上。这不是说案不要查，更不是说对极少数严重腐败的干部不要给予法律制裁，而是说，相对于这些做法而言，对干部群众进行法制教育，特别是进行公民义务与权利的教育，也同样重要，甚至更具有基础的作用和长远的意义。要教育党和国家机关工作人员具有法律意识和公仆意识，学会依法办事、照章办事；要教育群众懂得维护自己的权利，具有制度意识和监督意识。应该说这是舆论监督的一项重要内容。
    为了正确发挥舆论监督作用，我们新闻工作者必须进一步提高自身的责任感和法制观念，坚持实事求是的思想路线和工作作风。本报愿与兄弟新闻单位一起推进舆论监督工作，为保持党和国家机关的廉洁、建设社会主义民主政治、推进改革和现代化建设竭尽绵薄之力。
