The Ili Region in Xinjiang is the primary habitat and breeding ground for wild deer in Xinjiang. In recent years, due to excessive hunting and poaching, the number of wild deer here has sharply decreased from 100,000 in 1985 to less than 10,000 today.

In the summer of 1988, various counties in the Ili Region conducted investigations. In one instance, Gongliu County alone apprehended over 100 poachers, seized 34 guns, more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition, and 14 kilograms of deer antlers. In August and September of 1988, relevant departments intercepted 18 poachers at key transportation routes in Nileke County and at the Yama Crossing in Gongliu County. They confiscated 7 guns, 52 kilograms of deer sinew, 23 kilograms of deer antlers, and 82 deer tails. To obtain deer fetuses and kidneys, some people shoot at any deer they see, including young deer. Some even set traps and snares at locations where deer frequently appear. In July 1988, 17 deer carcasses were found in the Mengmala Forest Area of Yining County.

We urge relevant departments to take emergency measures to save the Ili deer from the brink of extinction.

　　救救伊犁地区的马鹿
    新疆伊犁地区，是新疆马鹿最主要的栖息地和繁殖地。近几年来，由于滥捕乱杀，这里的野生马鹿已由１９８５年的１０万头锐减到不足万头。
    １９８８年夏天，伊犁地区各县作了调查，光是巩留县一次就清出偷猎人员１００多人，猎枪３４支，子弹千余发，鹿茸１４公斤。１９８８年８、９两个月，有关部门在尼勒克县交通要道和巩留县雅马渡等地截获偷猎者１８人，猎枪７支，鹿筋５２公斤，鹿茸２３公斤，鹿尾８２条。为了取鹿胎、鹿肾，一些人见鹿就打，连小鹿也不放过。有的还在马鹿经常出没的沟口设置圈套陷阱。１９８８年７月，伊宁县孟玛拉林区曾发现１７头马鹿陈尸旷野。
    　　　　　　　　呼吁有关部门采取紧急措施，救救濒临灭绝的伊犁马鹿。
