In Maotan Township, Buliang Village, Guizhou City, Anhui Province, there is a true story of a family caring for a blind, wandering orphan for 33 years.

The blind woman, Zheng Juhua, is 70 years old this year. When she was 3 years old, she contracted smallpox, which affected her eyes and left her blind. In her teens, her parents passed away one after the other, leaving her to wander alone, leading a very miserable life. In 1955, a couple from Buliang Village, Wang Yangsong and Yu Yinhua, took pity on this unfortunate blind woman and adopted her into their family. At first, Zheng Juhua felt guilty and one night, she secretly left, falling into a ditch. Yu Yinhua found her and brought her back, treating her as a sister, sleeping with her at night and comforting her.

Wang and Yu were both farmers with one son and four daughters, and their family was very poor. In 1958, the village suffered a famine, and many people died. Their youngest daughter died at the age of 8 due to severe malnutrition. However, whenever there was food, even if it was just a bowl of porridge, it would be given to Zheng Juhua first. Zheng Juhua suffered from severe migraines and nerve paralysis throughout her body, sometimes experiencing three episodes a month. When she had an attack, the family would take turns caring for her, either by bringing her medicine, feeding her, helping her with personal hygiene, or chatting with her.

In 1979, Wang Yangsong passed away, and Yu Yinhua, being old and weak, passed the responsibility of caring for Zheng Juhua to her son Wang Youlong and his wife Wu Chunmei. The young couple treated the blind woman as their own mother, ensuring she had enough to eat, wear, and use during festivals and New Year celebrations. Wang Youlong always remembered to bring Zheng Juhua her favorite five-spice tea sticks whenever he went into the city. Last autumn, his wife spent the money from selling eggs to buy Zheng Juhua a black velvet headscarf instead of buying something for herself. In 1985, the family built three new brick houses, bought new beds, and new bedding. The family decided to let Zheng Juhua move into the south-facing room, while Yu Yinhua continued to live in the old thatched house.

The 21-year-old granddaughter, Wang Xiuping, and the 15-year-old grandson, Wang Baqiang, had learned from their grandmother and parents, showing great respect and care for the blind grandmother. Seeing their parents busy with farming, Xiuping quietly took over the mending and washing for Zheng Juhua. Before winter, Xiuping made a new pair of cotton shoes for the blind grandmother. To keep the grandmother from feeling lonely, Xiuping would sleep with her every night, sometimes humming a tune from the Huainan region that the grandmother loved. Every evening after school, Baqiang would either accompany the grandmother for a walk around the village or play the radio for her, telling her about the latest news.

33 years have passed, and Zheng Juhua has formed an inseparable bond with the non-blood-related Yu Yinhua family.

　　祖孙三代与一盲女
    周备
    在安徽省贵池市茅坦乡步岭村，流传着一家农户祖孙三代义务照料一个双目失明的流浪孤女长达３３年的真实故事。
    盲姑名叫郑菊花，今年７０岁。她３岁时因患天花祸及眼睛，双目失明。十几岁时，亲生父母相继去世，她一人漂泊四方，生活十分凄苦。１９５５年，步岭村农民夫妇王阳松、余银花十分同情这个孤苦的盲姑，把她收养在家。一开始，盲姑过意不去，在一天晚上偷偷溜走，跌倒在路沟里。余银花知道后，立即把她找了回来，认她做亲姐妹，晚上陪她睡，开导她。
    王、余夫妻俩都是庄稼人，养有１男４女，家境很困苦。１９５８年这个村闹饥荒，死了不少人。他们的小女儿因严重的营养缺乏症，８岁时患病死去。可家里只要有吃的，哪怕是一碗粥，都要先给盲姑端去。盲姑患有严重的偏头痛和周身神经麻痹症，有时一月要发作三次。她发病时，他们一家人就轮流在床前护理，或为她请医送药，或为她喂饭喂水，或为她梳洗理容，或陪她谈心聊天。
    １９７９年，王阳松去世，余银花年老体弱，照顾郑菊花的担子就落在儿子王有龙和媳妇吴春梅的肩上。小夫妻俩把盲姑当作自己的亲母亲一样看待，逢节过年，吃的、穿的、用的，都给两个妈妈一人一份。儿子王有龙每次进城办事，总不忘带些盲姑爱吃的五香茶干。去年秋天，媳妇拿了卖鸡蛋的钱去赶集，放着自己看中的衣服不买，先给盲姑买了块黑绒的包头巾。１９８５年，家里盖了三间新瓦房，打了新床，置了新被褥。全家人合计把朝南的一间正房让盲姑先搬进去住，余银花自己却住原来的旧草屋。
    ２１岁的孙女王秀平和１５岁的孙子王保强耳濡目染奶奶和父母的行为和品德，对盲人奶奶同样十分孝敬。他们见父母忙着耕种责任田，秀平就悄悄包下了郑菊花老人的缝补浆洗。冬天未到，小秀平就赶制了一双新棉鞋给盲姑奶奶穿上了。怕盲姑奶奶寂寞，小秀平每晚陪老人睡，有时还为老人哼上一段皖南人爱听的黄梅调。孙子王保强每晚放学回来，不是扶老人到村内村外散步，就是在老人耳边开收音机，给她讲讲外面的新鲜事。
    ３３年过去了，郑菊花与非亲非故的余银花一家结下了不解之缘。
