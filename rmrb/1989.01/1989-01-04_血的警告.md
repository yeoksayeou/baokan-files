Title: Blood's Warning

A report states: A fake letter claiming "mother deceased, father critically ill" caused a soldier, Wang Jianjiang, who was unaware of the truth, to be overwhelmed with grief, leading to a mental breakdown. Later, he was run over by a train, resulting in his right leg being severed and leaving him permanently disabled. His living parents, upon hearing the bad news, cried inconsolably and regretted their actions deeply. This is a tragedy caused by a fake letter, which is heart-wrenching and serves as a bloody warning to those whose children are serving in the military!

The fake letters that caused this tragedy are not uncommon in today's military camps. The author has a document stating that in a company with dozens of soldiers, over 30 fake letters were received this year alone; the brigade to which this company belongs received over 400 fake letters in 10 months. These fake letters, which flood into the military camps, almost unanimously contain messages such as "father is critically ill," "mother has passed away," "sister is hospitalized," "house has collapsed," and so on, aiming to make the soldiers request leave to return home. Some are written by parents who miss their children, some are to arrange marriages, some are to help with business to make money, and there are even cases where they are used to resolve neighborhood disputes and seek military support. These fake letters, which are almost indistinguishable from real ones, not only make it difficult for military leaders but also add immense psychological pressure to the soldiers themselves.

Most of the perpetrators of these fake letters are the loving parents of the soldiers. "A mother's worry knows no bounds when her child is far away." It is natural for parents to worry when their children are serving in the military, but soldiers have clear regulations on when they can return home. They cannot be called back just because someone wants them to, nor can they fabricate situations to return home. This lack of honesty is not acceptable and also loses respect in the eyes of their children. If they let their children in uniform return home to make money or to resolve disputes, that is even more unacceptable, as it could harm their children!

Today's military camps are undergoing reforms, and soldiers are busy training. As the New Year approaches, parents are eagerly awaiting their children's return, and the "peak season" for fake letters is about to arrive. For the sake of the military and the children, please, parents, do not send fake letters!

　　血的警告
　　顾仁君
    报载：一封“母亡父危”的假家书，使不明真相的某部队战士王建刚悲痛欲绝，导致精神失常，后又被火车轧断右腿，造成终身残废。他的健在的父母得知恶讯，哭得死去活来，后悔莫及。这是一起由假函电酿成的悲剧，令人痛心，它给那些孩子在部队当兵的亲人发出了血的警告！
    酿成这起悲剧的假函电，在今日军营屡见不鲜。笔者手头有份材料称，一个几十号人的连队，今年以来收到３０多件假函电；这个连队所在的团队，１０个月假函电超过４００份。这些纷纷飞进军营的假函电，内容几乎无一例外：“父亲病危”、“母亲病故”、“妹妹住院”、“房屋倒塌”，以此让战士请假回家。有的是家长思儿心切，有的是让相亲找对象，有的是让当帮手做生意赚钱，甚至还有与邻居闹矛盾搬兵助威……假函电以假乱真，不仅使部队领导为难，而且给战士本人也增添了巨大的精神压力。
    假函电的导演，大多数是疼爱子女的战士父母。“儿行千里母担忧”，孩子在部队当兵，父母牵挂是人之常情，但战士当兵几年能探家，部队是有明文规定的，不能想叫回来就回来，不能回来就造假情况，有失做人的诚实，也在孩子面前有失尊严，实不可取。若让穿军装的孩子回来赚钱，为纠纷助威，那更是不容许，弄不好会害了孩子！
    今日军营，改革潮涌，战士练兵正忙。眼下又近新年，父母盼儿探家心切，假函电的“旺季”即将来临。为了部队，为了孩子，请亲人们莫发假函电！
