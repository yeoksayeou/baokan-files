In 1988, the management of audio and video materials in Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture in our province was in a state of chaos. Some operators, driven by greed, were engaged in the illegal reproduction and screening of smuggled video tapes, and the illegal screening of obscene videos.

On July 15, 1988, the film projection team of Feng County Cultural Center openly screened obscene films. On August 8 and 13, the Public Security Bureau of Yongshun County caught several people watching obscene videos at the dormitory of the county's Material Supply Bureau and the county's Fishery Company's video screening venue.

According to investigations, from August 15 to September 13, Yongshun County alone seized 50 points distributing obscene videos, with 209 people watching obscene videos. Among them, 21 were party members and cadres, 9 were teachers, 1 was an active military personnel, 198 were workers, and 18 were young people from society. The incident involved 31 county-level units and 4 towns and 2 townships. Some students from Lingxi Middle School in Yongshun County, after watching obscene videos, imitated obscene actions in schools, other units, and even some public places, harassed women, and disrupted social order, with a very bad influence.

　　湘西录音录像管理混乱
    １９８８年，我省湘西土家族苗族自治州录音录像管理十分混乱，一些经营者见利忘义，复制、放映走私录像带，违法播放淫秽录像。
    １９８８年７月１５日，凤凰县文化馆放像队公开挂牌放映淫秽片；８月８日、１３日晚，永顺县公安局在县物资局职工宿舍和县水产公司录像场抓获观看淫秽录像者多人。
    据调查统计，从８月１５日至９月１３日，仅永顺县查获的淫秽录像传播点５０个，观看淫秽录像的人员达２０９人，其中党员干部２１人，教师９人，现役军人１人，职工１９８人，社会青年１８人，涉及到３１个县直机关单位和４个镇２个乡。永顺县灵溪中学的一些学生看了淫秽录像后，在学校、别的单位甚至一些公共场所，模仿淫秽动作，挑逗女性，扰乱社会秩序，影响极坏。
