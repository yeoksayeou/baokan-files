Fruits and vegetables come first, and then canned fruits and vegetables; for enterprises that use agricultural and sideline products as raw materials, fruits and vegetables are their daily indispensable "food." From the practical experience of the Bazhong Canned Food Factory, it is evident that investing in and protecting one's own "food" base is a matter that is well worth seriously addressing.

Unfortunately, many enterprises still do not recognize this importance. In their view, each does their own thing. Farmers handle production, and enterprises handle processing. If you produce too much, I can lower the grade and price; if you produce too little, I can raise the price and rush to buy. Separating raw materials and processing into "two skins" inevitably leads to economic fluctuations, and even causes production to decline.

Some enterprises have only realized the importance of establishing a "food" base after suffering losses. Like the Bazhong Canned Food Factory, ensuring "six guarantees" for the base is a genuine measure to protect the "food" base, ensure agricultural harvests, and ensure that farmers make money without losing money. In this way, the base is consolidated, agricultural and sideline products are in line with market demand, and the development of processing enterprises will not lack momentum.

### 保自己的“粮食”基地

　　保自己的“粮食”基地
    万兴
    先有水果、蔬菜，然后才有水果、蔬菜罐头；对那些以农副产品为原料的加工企业来讲，水果、蔬菜就是他们每天不可缺少的“粮食”。从巴中罐头食品厂的实践看，下本钱保自己的“粮食”基地，是件很值得切实抓好的事情。
    可惜，有相当一部分企业至今还没有认识到这一点。在他们看来，敲锣卖糖，各干一行。农民搞生产，企业管加工。你生产的东西多了，我可以压级压价；你生产的东西少了，我再抬价抢收。原料、加工“两张皮”，必然是“少了鞭子赶，多了刀子砍”，造成经济的起伏动荡，甚至使生产滑坡。
    一些企业正是吃了“苦头”之后，才认识到建立“粮食”基地的重要性。像巴中罐头食品厂那样，对基地实行“六个保证”，这是真心拿出过硬的措施保“粮食”基地，保农业丰收，保农民赚钱不亏本。这样，基地巩固了，农副产品适销对路了，加工企业发展何愁没有后劲？
