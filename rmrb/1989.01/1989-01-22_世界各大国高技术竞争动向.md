The United States is investing heavily in research funding to maintain its position as a leading technological power. In 1987, the U.S. government allocated $63 billion for research and development. According to the National Science Foundation, the total R&D expenditure in the U.S. is expected to reach $200 billion by 1990.

Japan is pursuing a strategy of "technology-based nation-building." In March 1980, it announced that technology would be the cornerstone of Japan's economic development. Last year, Japan's R&D funding reached 8.1 trillion yen, making it the second-highest in the world. The country is also accelerating the implementation of several major and medium-sized research projects, such as the "Sunshine Project," the "Moonlight Project," the fifth-generation computer, and super-large-scale integrated circuits.

The countries of Western Europe are currently moving towards forming a technological community to jointly counterbalance other powers. In April 1986, they began implementing the "Eureka Plan," with 19 countries participating in 165 research projects, and a budget exceeding $5 billion.

The Soviet Union is actively promoting international scientific and technological cooperation centered around the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA). It is conducting research in 29 high-tech fields and is formulating development plans to achieve world-class standards in various major disciplines.

　　世界各大国高技术竞争动向
    美国不惜巨资增加科研经费以保住科技大国的地位。１９８７年，美国政府所拨的科研经费达６３０亿美元，据美国全国科学基金会预计，１９９０年美国科研总开支将达到２０００亿美元。
    日本搞“技术立国”。１９８０年３月，宣布今后要以“技术立国”作为日本经济发展的基本国策。去年科研经费高达８．１万亿日元，居世界第二，并加紧实施几十个大中型科研计划，如“阳光计划”、“月光计划”、第五代计算机、超大规模集成电路等。
    西欧诸国目前正在走上组成科技共同体，联合抗衡的道路。１９８６年４月，开始执行“尤里卡计划”，已有１９个国家参加了其中的１６５个研究项目，预算资金超过了５０亿美元。
    苏联正在积极开展以“经互会”为中心的国际科技合作，在高技术的２９个领域投入研究，并着手制定在各主要学科达到世界水平的发展规划。
