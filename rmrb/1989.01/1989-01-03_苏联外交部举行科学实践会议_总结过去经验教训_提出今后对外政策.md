The Soviet Foreign Ministry held a "Scientific Practice" conference in July 1988, reviewing the development and changes in the Soviet Union's foreign policy over the past few decades. Based on a profound reflection on the mistakes in past foreign policies, the conference elucidated the future diplomatic tasks and foreign policy concepts. Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze delivered the keynote speech. Over 300 diplomats and scholars attended the conference, which was divided into eight groups for discussion. Eight deputy foreign ministers summarized the discussions on different topics.

The conference noted that "distortions in domestic life" had a "necessary impact" on the Soviet Union's foreign policy. The "arbitrariness" of the 1930s cast a "shadow" over the foreign policy, "tarnishing the country's image." The distortion of the relationship between internationalism principles and the communist movement made the situation "more serious," and the one-sided evaluation of European democratization "seriously undermined the anti-Hitler united front." The "closed-door habit" cultivated in the 1950s led to the withdrawal from the Geneva talks in the 1980s, accelerating the establishment of the second anti-Soviet front in Europe. The "painful lessons" of Afghanistan not only lowered the living standards of the Soviet people but also damaged the reputation of socialism. Therefore, the decision of the 19th National Congress of the CPSU to discuss and formulate important foreign policies was a hard-won achievement by the Soviet people. The conference pointed out that the new thinking determined the direction of the Soviet Union's foreign policy. Realism, balance of interests, emphasis on the values of all humanity, equal security, equal dialogue, and the supremacy of international law in international affairs, with political means playing a leading role, are all components of the Soviet Union's foreign policy.

The participants supported the main premise of the new thinking: in the nuclear and space age, the interests of all humanity should be given "priority," and peaceful coexistence is the "highest universal principle" of international relations, not a means of class struggle. To ensure national interests, one must "understand the universal direction of human movement." The world is "interdependent," and only peaceful coexistence can ensure survival. Therefore, the opposition between the two systems should not be seen as the main trend of the times. The opposition between capitalism and socialism can only be eliminated through peaceful competition and peaceful competition.

The conference believed that the Great Patriotic War had a "decisive influence" on the formation of the Soviet Union's security concept. At that time, the security of the state depended on "well-trained and well-equipped armed forces." However, today, "what is decisive is not so much the arsenal as the ability to develop and produce new weapons," that is, the potential in science, technology, production equipment, and human resources. Therefore, disarmament should be given priority in foreign policy. The main task of diplomatic work is "to find friends, and at least not to create enemies."

In discussing whether the United States should be the focus of the Soviet Union's foreign policy, "the opinions of the participants were not entirely consistent." Some believed that Soviet-American relations might experience a "stall," and this stall should be used to "actively develop work with Western Europe"; most people, however, believed that focusing on the United States was a "reflection of objective reality."

Regarding the European issue, the conference emphasized the idea of building a "pan-European house," believing that Europe is at the "threshold of a new historical stage." The participants advocated reducing conventional armaments as the "top issue" in Soviet-European relations. Some suggested taking "unilateral steps" to reduce Soviet forces in Europe; others believed this should be done on a "mutual basis." Most people believed that without the participation of European countries, it would be impossible to resolve the issue of reducing conventional armaments with the United States, and attempts to separate the United States and Western Europe would be "ineffective."

The conference emphasized the importance of Soviet-Japanese relations, believing that the Asia-Pacific region is becoming a "new bastion of industry and non-military society," and that the Soviet Union's geographical position could make it a "bridge" between Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.

In discussing the relationship between the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, the conference emphasized the need to "draw necessary lessons," avoid repeating "shortcomings and oversights," and abandon dogmatism in the diversity of socialism and the development of socialism. Cooperation between countries should be "further democratized," acknowledging the need to "respect national interests, consider the characteristics of each country, and maintain a balance of interests among them."

The conference believed that relations with Third World countries should be developed on a realistic basis, considering the characteristics of each country and the "real possibilities" of the Soviet Union itself.

The conference emphasized the role of economics in diplomacy, proposing to improve the country's participation in international economic organizations and advocating the "demolition of the wall that has isolated the domestic economy from the outside world for many years." This is a matter of ensuring the Soviet Union's "position in the contemporary world." The participants believed that "all forms and methods of participating in the international division of labor" and "world practices" must be utilized, but this had not been specifically planned in the past. They believed that only by establishing a management system based on economic principles at home could the "external political structure" effectively function. In developing cooperation with developing countries, economic and political considerations should be "comprehensively studied," clarifying which should be "commercial" and which can be "preferential." The conference believed that the task of the Soviet Union's foreign policy is to vigorously promote the country's social and economic progress. Therefore, "evaluating foreign policy from an economic perspective" should be given priority.

　　苏联外交部举行科学实践会议
    总结过去经验教训　提出今后对外政策
    本报讯  据苏联《国际生活》月刊１９８８年第９期报道，苏联外交部于１９８８年７月举行“科学实践”会议，回顾了苏联近几十年来对外政策的发展变化，在对以往的外交政策失误进行深刻反思的基础上，阐明了今后的外交任务及对外政策构想。谢瓦尔德纳泽外长作了主旨报告，外交界人士和学者共３００余人出席了会议，分８个组进行讨论。８位副外长分别就不同的专题作了讨论总结。
    会议认为，“国家内部生活的扭曲”对苏联对外方针产生“必然的影响”。３０年代的“专横”给对外政策“罩上了一层阴影”，“玷污了国家形象”。对国际主义原则同共产主义运动的相互关系的歪曲，使“情况更加严重”，对欧洲民主化的片面评价“严重破坏了反希特勒的统一战线”。５０年代“养成的‘关门’习惯”导致８０年代“退出日内瓦谈判”，加速了欧洲反苏“第二战线”的建立。“阿富汗的痛苦教训”不仅降低了苏联人民的生活水平，而且损害了社会主义的名声。因此，苏共第１９次全国代表会议关于讨论和制定重要对外政策的决定，是苏联人民“历尽艰辛才取得的”。会议指出，新思维决定了苏联对外政策的方向，现实主义、利益均衡、以全人类的价值为重点，同等安全、平等对话、国际法高于一切，在国际事务中政治手段占主导地位等是苏联对外政策的组成部分。
    与会者支持新思维的主要前提是，在核宇宙时代，全人类的利益“应置于优先地位”，和平共处是“国际关系的最高普遍原则”，而不是阶级斗争的一种手段。要保证国家利益，“必须理解人类普遍的运动方向”。世界是“相互依存的”，只有和平共处才能生存，因此，“不能把两大体系的对立看作是当代的主要趋势”。资本主义同社会主义的对立“只能通过和平竞赛和和平竞争来消除”。
    会议认为，卫国战争对形成苏联的安全概念产生了“决定性影响”。当时，国家的安全取决于“训练有素、装备精良的武装力量”。但是在今天，“具有决定性意义的与其说是武库，不如说是研制和生产新武器的能力”，即科学、工艺、生产设备和人才等方面的潜力，因此应把裁军放在对外政策的首位。外交工作的主要任务“是寻找朋友，至少不是树立敌人”。
    在讨论是否应以美国为苏联对外政策的重点对象时，“与会者的意见并不完全吻合”。有人认为苏美关系可能出现“停顿”，应利用这种停顿“积极开展对西欧的工作”；多数人则认为以美国为重点“是客观现实的反映”。
    关于欧洲问题，会议强调了建立“全欧大厦”的思想，认为欧洲正处在“历史新阶段的门坎”。与会者主张把裁减常规军备作为苏欧关系的“头号问题”。有人提出“不妨采取单方面步骤”裁减苏联驻欧军力；有人则认为这应当在“相互原则基础”上进行。多数人认为，没有欧洲国家参加，就不可能同美国解决裁减常规军备问题，试图把美国和西欧分开“是不会奏效的”。
    会议强调苏日关系的重要性，认为亚太地区正在成为“工业和非军事社会的新堡垒”，而苏联所处的地理位置有可能使它成为“欧洲和亚太地区的桥梁”。
    在讨论苏联同其他社会主义国家的关系时，会议强调要“吸取必要的教训”，不要重犯“缺点和疏忽”，在社会主义“多样性”及社会主义发展问题上“必须放弃教条主义”，应使国家之间的合作“进一步民主化”，承认“必须尊重国家利益，考虑各国特点和保持它们之间的利益均衡”。
    会议认为，必须在现实主义基础上发展同第三世界国家的关系，既要考虑各国的特点，也要考虑苏联自身的“现实可能性”。
    会议突出强调了经济在外交中的作用，提出要提高国家参加国际经济组织的效益，主张“拆除多年来使本国经济与外界隔绝的那堵墙”，这是保证苏联“在当今世界的地位问题”。与会者认为，“必须运用参加国际分工的一切形式、方法”和“世界惯例”，而过去并没有就此作出具体规划。他们认为，只有国内建立起在经济原则基础上的管理体制，“对外政治基础结构”才能有效地发挥作用。在同发展中国家发展合作时，也要“从经济上和政治上通盘研究”，明确哪些“应具有商业性质”，哪些“可以是优惠的”。会议认为，苏联对外政策的任务是大力促进国家的社会经济进步，因此，“从经济上评价对外政策”，应当放在首位。
