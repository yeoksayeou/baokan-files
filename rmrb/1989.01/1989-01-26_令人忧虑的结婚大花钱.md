A young man in Qingdao, busy preparing for his wedding during the Spring Festival, said that he has already spent nearly 10,000 yuan, but compared to others, he feels that his wedding preparations are still not "up to par."

In Qingdao, high wedding expenditures seem to have become a trend.

A survey conducted by the Qingdao Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League last year on 395 young people from 23 grassroots units in 10 systems across the city revealed that the average wedding expenditure per couple is 9,035 yuan, with the highest reaching 31,000 yuan.

Such astonishingly high wedding expenditures are obviously not something every newlywed couple can afford. According to the survey, 51.5% of the wedding expenses for young people in Qingdao come from parental support, 36% from the savings of the young couple themselves, 8% from the support of relatives and friends, and 4.5% from loans.

The reasons for the high wedding expenditures are multifaceted, but one important factor that cannot be ignored is the desire to keep up with others: comparing who is more impressive, dignified, and wealthy.

Reflecting on the phenomenon of excessive wedding spending, there are two points worth considering.

The first point is that young people's consumer attitudes need guidance. In Qingdao, many young people view conspicuous consumption as trendy and beyond reproach. In the survey, 12.9% of the young people openly expressed the attitude of "if others have it, I want it too." In these young people's homes, in addition to color TVs, refrigerators, and stereo systems, some even have VCRs, pianos, microwaves, and air conditioners. Even the items used for entertaining guests are becoming more luxurious, with cigarettes like "Marlboro" and "Jinling," and liquor like "Maotai" and "Wuliangye."

The second point is the role of parents in "fanning the flames." During the interviews, it was discovered that some of the excessive wedding spending comes from the parents' wishes. An elderly worker couple living in the Shinnan District spent all their savings accumulated over the years on their children's weddings. When asked by the reporter, "Why couldn't you help them with simpler arrangements?" he replied, "The children had that intention, but it wouldn't do, no matter how frugal, one cannot skimp on such a big celebration!"

Weddings are a major event in life and naturally should be celebrated and the new household should be properly set up. However, disregarding one's economic capacity and focusing solely on grandeur and showing off wealth, what benefits does this bring to society and to oneself?

　　令人忧虑的结婚大花钱
    新华社通讯员  王川  新华社记者  刘海民
    青岛的一位正在忙于春节办喜事的男青年说，眼下他已花掉了近万元钱，但与他人相比，又感到婚事筹办得还不够“味”。
    在青岛，结婚高消费似乎已经成了一种“时髦”。
    共青团青岛市委去年在对全市１０个系统２３个基层单位的３９５名青年的抽样调查表明，平均每对结婚青年用于结婚的费用为９０３５元，最高的达３．１万元。
    惊人的结婚高消费，显然不是每对新婚夫妇都能承受得了的。据调查，青岛年轻人的结婚费用中，来自父母赞助的部分占５１．５％，来自青年双方自己积蓄的占３６％，靠亲朋好友们支持的占８％，靠借款的占４．５％。
    造成结婚高额花销的原因固然是多方面的，但其中不容忽视的一个重要原因是攀比：比气派、体面和富有。
    透视结婚大花钱的现象，大概有两点值得反思。
    反思之一是，青年的消费观需要引导。从青岛的情况看，不少青年认为超前消费是新潮，无可挑剔。在抽样中，有１２．９％的青年毫不掩饰地表示了“别人有，我也要有”的态度。在这些青年的家中，除了彩电、冰箱、组合音响外，有些人还买了录像机、钢琴、微波炉、空调器。待客用品也愈来愈高档，烟要“万宝路”“健牌”，酒要“茅台”“五粮液”等。
    反思之二是，家长们的“推波助澜”。记者在采访中发现，结婚大花钱，有些是来自家长们的意愿。一位家住市南区的老工人老两口多年的一点积蓄都给孩子们办了婚事。当记者问他：“你们为何不能帮他们操持得简单点？”他说：“孩子们倒有这意思，可那不成，再省也不能省这大喜事哟！”
    结婚是人生大事，自然应该庆贺一番，也应该把小家庭装扮起来。但是，不顾自己的经济承受能力一味地讲排场，比阔气，于社会、于自己究竟有多少益处呢？
