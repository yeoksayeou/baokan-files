Farmers in Tounan Establish Volunteer Military Reception Stations

New China News Agency, Changchun, January 28th - (Correspondent Liuchi) In five townships of Tounan City, Jilin Province, 2,500 households have established volunteer military reception stations. They long-term provide accommodation for troops conducting shooting training, which has been praised by the soldiers.

These five townships have an unwritten rule: when building a house, construct four rooms, with the rightmost room equipped with a stove, cooking utensils, and a mirror, specifically for accommodating soldiers. So far, all 2,500 households in these five townships that have built new houses have set aside one room for receiving soldiers, thus solving the accommodation problem for the shooting training troops.

　　洮南农家设立义务拥军接待站
    新华社长春１月２８日电（通讯员刘池）吉林省洮南市５个乡的２５００户农家设立义务拥军接待站，长期为前来进行打靶训练的部队提供宿营地，受到子弟兵的称赞。
    这５个乡有一个不成文的规矩：盖房就盖４间，右侧一间备有锅灶、炊具、整容镜，专门用来接待子弟兵。到目前为止，这５乡２５００户盖起了新房的农民家家都留有一间作为接待子弟兵的房间，使打靶部队宿营问题都得到了解决。
