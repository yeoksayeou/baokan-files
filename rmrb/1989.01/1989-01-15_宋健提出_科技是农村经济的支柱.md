Song Jian, State Councilor and Minister of the State Science and Technology Commission, stated at the closing ceremony of the National Conference on Technological Advancement in Township Enterprises that to achieve modernization of agriculture and the rural economy, it is crucial to guide the rural populace towards a path of industrialized commodity production driven by science and technology.

Song Jian emphasized that "small-scale, labor-intensive, and backward methods" or "brute-force approaches" rely on physical labor. History has shown that such methods will not succeed and cannot lead the people to prosperity. Our policy is to develop a socialist commodity economy with science and technology as its pillars. He stressed that we must guide the people to learn how to work efficiently, producing high-quality products ten or even several dozen times more than current levels within the same time frame, and ensuring these products are sold to generate monetary income or to exchange for needed resources. To achieve this, two conditions are essential: economies of scale and reliance on science and technology. These two factors are interdependent and cannot be separated.

Song Jian mentioned that the "Harvest Plan" and the "Vegetable Basket Project" implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture, as well as the "Spark Program" being executed by the State Science and Technology Commission, are all national-scale scientific and technological plans aimed at serving the development of the rural economy. If these plans are persistently carried out, they will undoubtedly yield tremendous achievements.

　　宋健提出——
    科技是农村经济的支柱
    １９８８年１２月３１日《信息日报》报道：国务委员兼国家科委主任宋健在全国乡镇企业技术进步工作会议闭幕式上指出，实现农业现代化，农村经济现代化，最重要的是引导农村人民走以科技为支柱的工业化商品生产的道路。
    宋健主任指出，“小土群”或“土法上马”是拚体力。历史已经证明，这种“蛮干”不会成功，也不可能引导人民走向富裕。我们的方针是发展以科技为支柱的社会主义商品经济。他强调，要引导人民学会“干活”，即在单位时间内，生产比现在高十倍、几十倍的优质产品，而且要卖出去，取得货币收入，或换回自己短缺或需要的物资。要做到这一点，必须有两条件，一是要有规模经济，二是要依靠科技，这两者缺一不可，是相互联系的。
    宋健说，农业部实施的“丰收计划”和“菜篮子工程”，国家科委正在执行的“星火计划”，都是为发展农村经济服务的全国规模的科技工作计划，长期坚持下去，一定会取得巨大的成就。
