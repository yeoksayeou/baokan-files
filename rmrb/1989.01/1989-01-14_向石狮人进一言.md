They say, “If you haven’t been to Shishi, you haven’t been to Fujian.” Recently, I came to Shishi City out of admiration, and it felt like I was in a world of clothing and small commodities. The city has 7 markets and 4 streets with nearly 5,000 individual stalls, creating a scene where “clothing of all kinds covers the sky, and every street is a place for business.” Every day, tens of thousands of merchants and tourists come here.

I also noticed a disturbing phenomenon: as you walk down the street, you are often stopped. “Do you want a VCR tape? Pornographic.” “Do you want nude playing cards? Imported.” The people stopping you include young women, old women, and even children. Merchants and tourists from various places have been discussing this: “Everywhere else is cracking down on pornography, why is it allowed to be openly sold here?” “Something that is worth only 20 or 30 yuan is priced at over 100 yuan, is this fair trade?” “The market is so chaotic, why aren’t there any management personnel in sight?”

Shishi City, known as the “Pearl of Southern Fujian,” is a famous overseas Chinese hometown and is now a national-level market specializing in clothing and small commodities. The moral standards of the people of Shishi affect everyone from all over the country and overseas. We hope that Shishi City can become a window for spreading new civilized customs.

### 向石狮人进一言

　　向石狮人进一言
    人说：“没有到过石狮，就不算到过福建”。最近，我慕名来到石狮市，犹如置身于服装和小商品的世界。市区７个市场和４条街道有近５０００家个体摊店，形成“铺天盖地万式装，有街无处不经商”的景象。每天来此的商贾游客达三四万人。
    我也看到了一种令人不安的现象：当你在街上行走时，不时会被人拦住。“你要录相带吗？黄色的。”“你要裸体扑克牌吗？进口的”。拦路问话人有妙龄女郎，也有老妪，还有孩童。各地商贾游客对此颇有议论：“外面到处禁‘黄’，这里为何可以公开叫卖？”“明明只值二三十元钱的东西，标价１００多元，这叫买卖公平？”“市场秩序这么乱，为什么看不到管理人员？”
    素有“闽南明珠”之称的石狮市，是我国著名侨乡，目前又成为全国性的以服装为主的小商品专业市场。石狮人的道德风尚如何，对全国各地来的人和海外客人都产生着影响。我们期待着石狮市能成为传播文明新风的窗口。
