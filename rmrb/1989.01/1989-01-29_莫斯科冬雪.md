	Moscow Winter Snow
	Wú Déróng

	Every year in the last few days of November, a low-pressure system from southern parts of the Soviet Union brings a flurry of snow to the capital, Moscow. In no time, the entire city is covered with a thick layer of "white blanket," with some areas in the city accumulating up to 28 centimeters of snow.

	As soon as the snow falls, the city's sanitation teams spring into action. Approximately 6,000 snowplows, salt-spreading trucks, loading trucks, heavy-duty trucks, and tractors are dispatched to the streets and squares to clear the snow. According to Soviet meteorologists, a moderate snowfall can bring about 250,000 tons of snow, and the annual snowfall in Moscow is enough for each resident to build a small snow mountain of 12 cubic meters.

	The Moscow municipal authorities spend a considerable amount of money each year to clear the snow. Just to remove a snow layer of 8 centimeters once requires 1 million rubles. To keep the city's roads and squares clear and tidy throughout the winter, 25 million rubles are needed. Additionally, clearing snow from sidewalks, playgrounds, sports fields, courtyards, and other public facilities requires another 20 million rubles. This substantial sum could be used to build housing for 30,000 people.

	The battle against snow is not just fought on the ground; planes are often sent into the sky to intercept snow clouds before they reach the city. The primary method is to inject special agents into the clouds to make them "deliver" their snow earlier. Although this method is not always successful, it sometimes helps to reduce the concentration of snowfall and save on snow-clearing expenses.

	While the winter snow brings inconvenience to Moscow, it also brings immense joy to its residents. The city has 895 ice rinks for skaters to enjoy; ice hockey enthusiasts can play on 882 ice hockey rinks; and 307 fixed ski trails are available for skiing lovers. Thousands of anglers patiently wait by ice holes on the frozen Moscow River, finding great pleasure in fishing.

　　莫斯科冬雪
    吴德融
    每年１１月的最后几天，苏联南方的低气压总要给首都莫斯科送来满天雪花。不多时，全城就被覆盖上一层厚厚的“白毯”，市区内个别地方的积雪甚至厚达２８厘米。
    雪一下，市清洁队就忙碌起来了，大约６０００辆扫雪车、撒盐车、装卸车、载重车和拖拉机纷纷驶向大街和广场执勤。据苏联气象学家计算，一场中雪的降雪量就有２５０万吨之多，每年冬季的降雪量，莫斯科居民人均可以堆一座１２立方米的小雪山。
    莫斯科市政当局为清除积雪，每年耗资颇巨。光是排除８厘米厚的雪层一次就需花费１００万卢布。为保持全市道路、广场畅通和整洁，每年冬季要耗资２５００万卢布。此外，用于清除人行道、游戏场地、体育场、庭院和其他公共设施的积雪，还得再加２０００万卢布的开销。这笔巨资足可建造供３万多人居住的住房。
    同雪斗争不只限于在地面上进行，飞机也常常被派到天上去拦截尚未进入市区上空的降雪云层，主要是采用特殊的药剂给云层“打针”，让它提前“分娩”。虽然这种办法并不那么成功，但有时也能缓解降雪量过于集中以节省扫雪开支。
    冬雪给莫斯科带来困扰的同时，也给人们增添了无比的喜悦。全市８９５个滑冰场可任凭滑冰运动员们驰骋；冰球迷们可以在８８２个冰球场上尽情嬉戏；３０７条固定的滑雪路线为滑雪爱好者提供了方便。数以千计的钓鱼人在冰封的莫斯科河上耐心地守在冰窟窿旁垂钓，好不自得其乐！
