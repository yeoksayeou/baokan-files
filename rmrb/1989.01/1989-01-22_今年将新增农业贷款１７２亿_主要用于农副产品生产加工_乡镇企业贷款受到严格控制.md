This year will see a significant adjustment in the rural credit structure, with increased investment in agricultural loans and stricter controls on loans to township enterprises.

According to a report from today's opening of the China Agricultural Bank's national branch managers' meeting, the proportion of agricultural loans has been decreasing over the past two years. This year, the Agricultural Bank of China and rural credit cooperatives plan to increase agricultural loans by 17.2 billion yuan, a 68.1% increase over last year. Of this, the Agricultural Bank of China plans to increase loans by 9.2 billion yuan, a 21.8% increase. The new agricultural loans will be used to support the production and processing of important agricultural and sideline products such as grain, cotton, oilseeds, sugar, and pigs. Additionally, the direction of the existing nearly 80 billion yuan in agricultural loans will be adjusted to prioritize support for planting and breeding, support for national and local commercial grain, cotton, and sugar bases, support for agricultural resource development and infrastructure construction, and support for the "vegetable basket" project. The focus will be on developing meat, poultry eggs, aquatic products, and vegetable production to increase the effective supply of agricultural products and strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture.

It is also reported that in recent years, the Agricultural Bank of China and rural credit cooperatives have seen a significant increase in loans to township enterprises, which has played an important role in promoting the development of township enterprises, increasing farmers' income, and activating urban and rural economies. However, there are also problems such as overly rapid development, unreasonable structure, and chaotic economic management. This year, the Agricultural Bank of China's loans to township enterprises will basically maintain the level of last year. The new loans to township enterprises by rural credit cooperatives will also be reduced by half compared to last year, to appropriately slow down the development speed of township enterprises. For existing enterprises, efforts will be made to make good use of the existing funds, improve economic benefits, and develop healthily during the rectification and reorganization. At the same time, in coordination with relevant departments, a catalog of supported enterprises and products will be compiled to support the strong and restrict the weak. For enterprises with no guarantee of raw materials, unsold products, high energy consumption, and low efficiency, and for those engaged in illegal operations in the circulation sector, loans will be stopped and old loans will be recalled.

　　今年将新增农业贷款１７２亿    
    主要用于农副产品生产加工     
    乡镇企业贷款受到严格控制
    本报１月２１日讯  记者江夏从今天开幕的中国农业银行全国分行长会议上获悉：今年农村信贷结构有重要调整，农业贷款投入增加幅度较大，乡镇企业贷款则受到控制。
    据介绍，这两年农业贷款所占比重逐年下降，今年农行、信用社计划新增农业贷款１７２亿元，比上年增长６８．１％，其中农业银行计划增加９２亿元，增长２１．８％。新增的农业贷款要保证用于支持粮食、棉花、油料、糖料、生猪等重要农副产品的生产与加工，同时调整原有近８００亿元农业贷款的投向，优先支持种养业，支持国家和地方的商品粮、棉、糖基地建设，支持农业资源开发和农业基础设施配套建设，支持搞好“菜篮子”工程，重点发展肉类、禽蛋、水产和蔬菜等副食品生产，增加农产品有效供给，力争农业丰收。
    另据介绍，近几年农行、信用社的乡镇企业贷款增加较多，这对促进乡镇企业的发展、增加农民收入、活跃城乡经济，都起到了重要作用，但也存在发展速度过快、结构不够合理、经济管理混乱等问题。今年农行乡镇企业贷款基本维持上年水平。信用社乡镇企业新增贷款也将比去年压缩一半，以适当降低乡镇企业发展速度。对现有企业，要促使其用好现有资金，提高经济效益，在治理整顿中健康发展。同时要配合有关部门编制支持企业、产品的序列目录，扶优限劣。对原材料无保证、产品滞销、耗能高、低效益的企业，对在流通领域搞违法经营的企业，一律停止贷款并收回老贷款。
