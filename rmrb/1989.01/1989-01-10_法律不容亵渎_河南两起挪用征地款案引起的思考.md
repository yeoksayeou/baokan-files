Farmers, who have relied on tilling the land for generations, have always treasured the land. Without sowing and reaping, how can one have food to eat?

However, in the eyes of some people, land has become a means for them to make a fortune. Some local officials disregard party discipline and the law, either seizing farmland arbitrarily or using their power for personal gain during the process of expropriation, thereby arbitrarily infringing upon and damaging farmers' interests. According to statistics from the State Land Administration, in recent years, the proportion of petitions related to land issues has risen to the first place, and some have even escalated into serious incidents.

From the two cases that the reporter has come into contact with, some places handle such issues seriously and severely punish the offenders, thus gaining the trust and support of local farmers; some places, however, handle them hastily, making the disputes even more complicated and affecting social stability. The different handling of similar incidents in Henan's Puyang and Anyang is a stark contrast.

The Lessons from Hu Village

In early September 1988, the Puyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a document. The document criticized the illegal and undisciplined behavior of some former leaders and relevant personnel of Hu Village Township, who had misappropriated a large amount of land expropriation funds, seriously infringing upon the interests of the people. After more than nine months of effort, the problems reported by the masses had been basically investigated, and 4560,000 yuan of land expropriation funds that had been misappropriated had been recovered, along with 150,000 yuan in interest on the expropriation funds, 460,000 yuan in confiscated illicit gains, and 440,000 yuan in hidden funds that had been investigated and recovered, totaling 5190,000 yuan. The relevant personnel involved in the case were dealt with according to their errors and criminal facts, with 5 receiving party disciplinary actions, 1 receiving administrative disciplinary actions, and 6 receiving legal penalties.

The news spread, and the public was overjoyed, raising glasses to celebrate. Local residents presented plaques to the leaders and officials of Puyang City, with inscriptions such as "Rectifying the Source" and "Party Discipline Shines." An 83-year-old veteran party member from Zhanghai Village was deeply moved and told everyone, "This is what a real Communist Party is like!"

In Puyang, why did such a moving scene occur? Obviously, they truly adhered to the principle of "upholding justice and enforcing the law."

When the masses repeatedly reported the serious problem of the former leaders of Hu Village Township misappropriating a large amount of land expropriation funds, the leaders of the Puyang Municipal Committee paid great attention to this major issue involving farmers' interests.

Former Party Secretary of Hu Village Township, Shen Xiangkun, Deputy Secretary, Zhao Jianzeng, and Township Head, Chao Liuguan, abused their power to arbitrarily use and misappropriate the land expropriation funds of the masses. Since 1984, they had arbitrarily raised management fees alone, amounting to 690,000 yuan, all of which were used to build family houses, buy cars, and entertain guests. Some criminals also took the opportunity to embezzle and privately divide the funds, ultimately harming the powerless farmers.

The city organized a joint investigation team to investigate the matter thoroughly. The Hu Village case involved 11 township-level units and 8 administrative villages in the township, as well as some units and individuals outside the township, totaling 45 people. Such a complex case would have been difficult to investigate without the formation of a joint investigation team and the adoption of organizational and legal measures to handle it.

Local farmers once circulated a folk song: "No land to farm, no capital to do business, no backdoor to work as a laborer, is there still a way out for farmers!" Now, in Puyang, you can no longer hear that folk song. Just as the municipal committee's document pointed out, the misappropriation and use of land expropriation funds in Hu Village Township is not the only such case in Puyang. To effectively stop the occurrence and spread of such problems, it is necessary to take the lead in publicly handling typical cases.

The Lessons from Hongqi Village

However, in the neighboring Anyang City, there is a Hongqi Village in the suburbs that also had a case of misappropriating land expropriation funds, which has not been completely resolved to this day. In comparison, the Hongqi Village case seems even more thought-provoking.

Since 1983, 554.84 mu of land in the village had been continuously expropriated. Starting from 1985, the village leaders had arbitrarily borrowed money from outside, some to units, some to individuals, some with interest, some without interest, and there were 2,730,000 yuan that could be accounted for. In November 1987, six village groups in Hongqi Village sent people to the Dongfeng Township Government to report the problem of the expropriation land funds being misappropriated. Since then, for more than a year and a half, villagers have repeatedly gone to the township, district, city, province, and even the central government to report this problem, but it has not been resolved. Finally, 1,433 villagers jointly wrote a letter to the central government, demanding that the law be upheld.

Initially, the Dongfeng Township Hongqi Village problem did not attract the attention of the leaders of Anyang City. It was not until September of last year that the city unified its understanding, acknowledging that the Hongqi Village problem was one of misappropriation, which violated the national land management law. However, they believed that the provisions of the national land management law were not specific enough and "lacked sentencing standards," making it difficult to handle.

The reporter once asked the city leaders if any of them had gone to Hongqi Village to investigate? The answer was that no one had. Had they directly dialogued with the farmers' representatives? They had not. It was not until September of last year that they began to consult and dialogue with the farmers.

Although they acknowledged that the arbitrary misappropriation of land expropriation funds was illegal, they delayed taking action. A leader once said, "The state has promulgated so many laws, we simply cannot remember them all. In the past, I did not even know there was a land management law, and I have not even looked at it!" Therefore, some people say that the main target of legal education in our country should first be the leaders at all levels. In contrast, the farmers of Hongqi Village are quite familiar with the land management law and have even spontaneously organized the masses to study it.

The city leaders had expressed that they would limit the borrowed land expropriation funds to be recovered within a certain period. In fact, they have not yet fully recovered them. Among them, 1000,000 yuan borrowed to the Agricultural, Industrial, and Commercial Joint Venture Company for the construction of a commercial building, due to the building becoming a "half-finished" project, the company is now unable to repay it.

Some local comrades said, we do not approve of the masses collectively petitioning, nor do we approve of people gathering in groups to government agencies to exert pressure. However, as a power organ, it has the responsibility to patiently and timely receive the masses' visits, sincerely and earnestly solve the masses' hardships and reasonable demands. Especially for matters that violate regulations, all levels of government agencies have the responsibility to actively uphold the state's laws and regulations. The law does not tolerate desecration. Arbitrarily using and misappropriating farmers' land expropriation funds not only violates the national land management law and infringes upon farmers' interests but may also directly threaten farmers' lives.

In front of the law, on major issues involving farmers' interests, we should make clear choices.

　　法律不容亵渎
    ——河南两起挪用征地款案引起的思考
    本报记者  刘国胜
    祖祖辈辈靠耕耘而生存的农民，一向视土地为珍宝。不稼不穑，胡为餐兮？
    但是，在某些人眼里，土地却成了他们大捞一把的“资本”。一些地方的干部无视党纪国法，或乱占耕地，或在征用过程中以权谋私，随意侵占、损害农民利益。据国家土地管理局统计，近年来因土地问题上访的，所占比例已上升到第一位，有的甚至酿成恶性事件。
    从记者接触到的两起案例来看，有的地方能够认真对待，严肃查处，因而受到当地农民的信赖和拥戴；有的地方则草率从事，使事端和纠纷越闹越大，以致影响社会安定。河南的濮阳、安阳两地对同类事件的不同处理，就是一个鲜明对照。
    胡村案的启示
    １９８８年９月初，中共河南濮阳市委发了一个文件。文件批评了原胡村乡少数领导干部及有关人员违法乱纪，大量动用、挪用群众征地款，严重地侵犯了人民群众的利益。经过９个多月的努力工作，已基本查清了群众揭发的问题，追回被擅自动用、挪用的征地款４５６万元，追回征地款利息１５万元，追缴赃款４．６万元，查出并收回隐匿款４４万元，共计５１９万元。对案件所涉及的有关人员，根据其错误和犯罪事实，区别不同情况进行了处理，其中党纪处理５人，政纪处理１人，法纪处理６人。
    消息传出后，群情欢动，人们举杯庆贺。当地群众给濮阳市领导、市机关送来了匾旗，上面写着：“正本清源”、“党纪生辉”等字样。张海村一位８３岁的老党员感触颇深，他逢人就说：“这才叫真共产党呢！”
    在濮阳，为什么能出现如此动人的场面？很显然，他们真正做到了“秉公执法”。
    当群众多次反映原胡村乡领导干部大量挪用征地款的严重问题时，濮阳市委领导十分重视这个涉及农民利益的大问题。
    原胡村乡党委书记申相轲、副书记赵建增、乡长晁留群等人凭借手中之权，采取各种手段随意动用、挪用群众征地款。自１９８４年以来，仅乱提管理费一项即达６９万余元，全都用于建家属房、购车和请客送礼。一些犯罪分子也乘机贪污、私分，到头来遭殃的是无权无势的农民。
    该市组织起联合调查组，一查到底。胡村案涉及该乡１１个乡直单位、８个行政村，还涉及到乡外的一些单位和个人，共涉及人员４５人。如此复杂的案件，若不组成联合调查组，不采取组织措施和法律措施来查办，显然是难以查清的。
    当地农民曾流传过这样的顺口溜：“种田没地，做买卖没本，当工人没后门，还有没有农民的生路！”如今，在濮阳再也听不到那种顺口溜了。正像市委文件指出的，像胡村乡挪用、动用征地款的事在濮阳绝非仅有，为了有效地制止此类问题的发生和蔓延，必须抓住典型公开处理。
    红旗村的教训
    然而，濮阳市近邻、安阳市郊，有个红旗村，也同样发生了一起挪用征地款案，至今未能彻底解决。相比之下，红旗村案似乎更耐人寻味。
    自１９８３年以来，该村土地被连续征用５５４．８４亩。从１９８５年开始，该村领导干部便擅自向外借款，有的借给单位，有的借给个人，有的有利息，有的无利息，有账可查的共借出２７３万多元。１９８７年１１月，红旗村６个村民小组派人到东风乡政府反映过征用土地款被挪用等问题。自此之后，在长达一年多时间里，该村村民多次到乡、区、市、省以及中央反映这个问题，都没有得到解决。最后，１４３３名群众联名向中央写上访信，要求依法办事。
    起初，东风乡红旗村的问题并未引起安阳市领导同志重视。直到去年９月，市里才统一了认识，认定红旗村的问题属于挪用，违背了国家土地管理法。可是，他们又认为国家土地管理法规定的条文不够具体，“没有量刑标准”，因而不好处理。
    记者曾询问市领导同志，有哪一位去红旗村调查过？回答没人去过。是否同农民代表直接对话过？也没有。直到去年９月，他们才同农民协商对话。
    既然承认擅自挪用征地款是违法的，却又迟迟不加处理。一位领导同志还说：“国家颁布了那么多法，我们根本记不住，过去我就不晓得还有个土地管理法，看也没看过！”因而有人说，看来我国普法教育的主要对象，首先应当是各级领导干部。与此相反，红旗村的农民对土地管理法却相当熟悉，而且还自发地组织群众学习过。
    市里领导同志曾表示，要把借出的征地款限期追回。事实上，至今也未全部还清。其中一笔借给农工商联合公司用于建筑商业大厦的１００万元，由于大厦建筑成了“半截子”工程，该公司现已无力偿还。
    当地一些同志说，我们不赞成群众集体上访，更不赞成人们成群结队地到政府机关施加压力。但是，作为权力机关，则有责任耐心、及时地接待群众来访，真诚实意地认真解决群众的疾苦和合理要求。特别是对违犯法规的事，各级政府机关都有不可推卸的责任去自觉维护国家法令。法律不容亵渎。随意动用、挪用农民的征地款，不仅违反了国家土地管理法，侵犯了农民的利益，而且还可能给农民的生活直接造成威胁。
    在法律面前，在涉及到农民利益的大问题上，我们应当作出明确选择。
