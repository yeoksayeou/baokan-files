	“Grasp the Green Mountain Without Relaxing”
		— Written Before the Publication of the Sequel to Xiao Jingguang's Memoirs
		Song Renqiong

	January 4, 1988, was Xiao Jingguang's 85th birthday. Facing the chilly winter wind of early spring, I drove to Xiao Jingguang's residence. During our conversation, he enthusiastically told me that the sequel to his memoirs had been completed and would soon be published by the PLA Press. I was very pleased and also admired the hard work he had put into completing this meaningful task at such an advanced age.

	Xiao Jingguang and I are both from Hunan. He was born in Changsha, and I was born in Liuyang. Although we were born in the same era, he is six years older than me. Xiao Jingguang joined the revolution earlier than I did; he joined the Communist Youth League in 1920 and the Party in 1922, making him one of the Party's early members. In our interactions, I naturally regarded him as a mentor and elder brother.

	Our relationship dates back to before the Long March in 1934. When Xiao Jingguang was the Political Commissar of the Fifth Army Corps, I served as the Political Commissar of a regiment and a division within the Fifth Army Corps. During the period when Xiao Jingguang was the Commander of the Min-Gan Military Region, he was in a difficult situation. Under the suppression and attacks of the "Left" line, he was expelled from the Party and the military for the so-called "loss of Lichuan" and "failure in the Huwan battle," sentenced to five years in prison, and had no right to appeal. Some even advocated killing him. According to Xiao Jingguang, it was thanks to Chairman Mao's intervention: "Attacking Xiao Jingguang is attacking me, it's a case of killing the chicken to scare the monkey." Therefore, he was released early and became a teacher at the Red Army University. On October 18, 1934, Xiao Jingguang arrived at our cadre regiment's base in Jiuzhen Village, Ruijin, with the students from the upper cadre training team. He was tall and thin, with a strong and resolute look on his face. From there, we embarked on the long journey of the Long March. It was from that time that I came to know more about his character, his loyalty to the Party, and his dedication to the revolutionary cause.

	He told me that in the sequel to his memoirs, he mainly reviews and summarizes his experiences over the past thirty years since the founding of the nation, especially some important experiences and lessons from the construction of the navy.

	I fully understand his feelings. Although he is in his twilight years, he still cares deeply about the cause for which he has fought, pouring his heart into it, carefully summarizing historical experiences for future generations to learn from, and ensuring that the cause for which he has fought continues to flourish. This is the true purpose of his writing his memoirs.

	Xiao Jingguang served as the Commander of the Navy for thirty years. Recalling the establishment and development of the navy, he undoubtedly has the authority to speak. Perhaps due to the passage of time, many past events have faded from his memory, but he still cannot forget some major issues related to the construction of the navy. He clearly remembers the scene when Chairman Mao asked him to be the Commander of the Navy and the difficulties encountered in the early stages of naval construction. Flipping through the sequel to his memoirs, the major events in the construction of the People's Navy of New China are vividly depicted. We can learn from these experiences, draw lessons, be inspired, and gain enlightenment.

	It is well known that the construction of the navy is an important part of national defense construction since the founding of New China. Considering the history of China being bullied by imperialism for over a hundred years, often due to the lack of maritime defenses, and the need to liberate coastal islands and defend maritime security, the Party Central Committee decided to establish the People's Liberation Army Navy. In the early days of the founding of the nation, how to build the navy was a new topic. There was a lack of weapons and equipment, and there was no experience, which made it impossible to do without the help of the socialist country, the Soviet Union. According to some comrades, Chairman Mao selected Xiao Jingguang to be the Commander of the Navy from among many of our seasoned military leaders. Apart from Chairman Mao being relatively familiar with Xiao Jingguang's leadership abilities, another important factor was that Xiao Jingguang had studied in the Soviet Union twice and was familiar with the situation there, which could better help him learn from the Soviet Union's experience in building the navy. Xiao Jingguang went to the Soviet Union several times to discuss issues related to the construction of our navy and to negotiate the procurement of weapons and equipment for the navy. However, he did not confine himself to the Soviet experience but actively explored. Together with other leaders of the navy, he completed the task of establishing the navy in just five or six years. By 1956, the East Sea Fleet, South Sea Fleet, Qingdao Base, and Lushun Base had been established. The combat forces, from the air to the sea, from the surface to the underwater, from the islands to the coast, initially formed a defensive system. In the process of building and fighting, they cooperated with the land and air forces to liberate all coastal islands except Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu. The navy of New China, from nothing to something, achieved remarkable achievements in just a few years, which excited the whole nation.

	In September 1957, I, along with Marshal Nie and General Chen, went to Moscow. After negotiations, we signed an agreement with the Soviet side on new technologies such as rockets and aviation. This agreement included two types of missiles needed by the navy. Xiao Jingguang was very pleased to hear this, as he believed it was a good start for the navy to obtain new technologies. In November of the same year, he went to the Soviet Union with the Chinese military delegation to participate in the 40th anniversary celebrations of the October Revolution. During this period, he had several discussions with Soviet naval leaders and experts on new naval technologies, laying the foundation for the naval technology agreement signed between China and the Soviet Union in 1959.

	During the three years of economic difficulties in our country, the Soviet government withdrew its experts and tore up contracts, causing serious difficulties for the construction of the navy. Xiao Jingguang, together with other leaders of the navy, seriously implemented the Party's policy of self-reliance and self-improvement. He led the naval officers and soldiers to overcome difficulties, break through obstacles, and ensure the development of various undertakings in the construction of the navy. During the ten years of turmoil, like most of the old comrades, Xiao Jingguang also suffered. He was first persecuted by the Lin Biao and Li Zuopeng gang, and later framed by Zhang Chunqiao and Jiang Qing. Despite this, he always maintained a strong sense of Party discipline and unyielding will, overcoming interference, and dedicating himself to the construction of the navy and the cause of the Party.

	As Xiao Jingguang's sequel to his memoirs is about to be published, I will give him the poem I copied for his 85th birthday, which is as follows:

	Grasp the green mountain without relaxing, the roots firmly in the rocks.
	Thousands of grindings and strikes still firm, let the winds blow from all directions.

	I think this poem, which praises bamboo and people through bamboo, can truly reflect Xiao Jingguang's character, and giving it to him is undoubtedly appropriate.

　　“咬定青山不放松”    
    ——写在《肖劲光回忆录续集》出版之前
    宋任穷
    １９８８年１月４日，是肖劲光同志的八十五寿辰。迎着初春的料峭寒风，我乘车来到劲光同志的住处。交谈间，他兴致勃勃地告诉我，说他的回忆录续集已经完稿，不久将由中国人民解放军出版社出版。我很高兴，同时也感叹他于耄耋之年完成这一颇有意义的事业所付出的艰辛。
    我与肖劲光同志都是湖南人。他生于长沙，我生于浏阳，虽生于同一时代，但他年长我六岁。劲光同志参加革命也比我早，他１９２０年入团，１９２２年转党，是我党早期的党员。在我们的交往中，我自然地把他当作良师和兄长。
    我们之间的交往，要追溯到１９３４年长征之前。肖劲光同志任五军团政治委员时，我在五军团先后任团和师的政治委员。在肖劲光同志任闽赣军区司令员期间他身处逆境，在“左”倾路线的排挤打击下，以所谓“黎川失守”和“浒湾战斗失利”的罪名，开除了党籍、军籍，判五年徒刑，并且没有上诉权。有的人甚至主张杀掉他。据劲光同志告诉我，此时多亏毛主席出来说话：“打击肖劲光就是打击我，是杀鸡给猴看”。因此，他才得以提前释放，到红军大学当了教员。１９３４年１０月１８日，肖劲光与上干队的学员一起来到了我们干部团的驻地——瑞金九堡村。他高高的个子，瘦削的脸上透着坚强刚毅之气。从这里，我们一起踏上了漫漫长征路。也就是从那时开始，我才进一步了解了他的为人、他对党的耿耿忠心以及对革命事业的孜孜追求。
    他告诉我，在他的回忆录续集中，主要是回顾和总结建国后三十年的经历，特别是海军建设的一些重要经验教训。
    我十分理解他的心情。他虽至暮年，却仍然关心着他为之奋斗的事业，倾注心血，认真总结历史经验，以供后人借鉴，使为之奋斗的事业更加发扬光大。这正是他撰写回忆录的真正目的。
    肖劲光同志担任了三十年的海军司令员。回忆海军的创建和发展，无疑他是很有发言权的。也许由于岁月的流逝，淡漠了他对许多往事的记忆，可是对海军建设的一些重大问题，他至今也难以忘怀。他清楚地记得毛泽东主席要他当海军司令员时的情景，以及海军建设初期所遇到的困难……翻开他的回忆录续集，新中国海军建设的一系列重大事件历历在目。我们可以从中总结经验，吸取教训，受到鼓舞，得到启迪。
    众所周知，海军建设是新中国成立后国防建设的重要组成部分。鉴于百年多的中国近代屡遭帝国主义的欺侮，多因海上无有藩篱的历史教训，加之解放沿海岛屿、保卫领海安全的需要，党中央决定组建中国人民解放军海军。建国初期，如何建设海军是一个崭新的课题，既缺乏武器装备，又没有经验，这就离不开社会主义国家苏联的帮助。据有的同志告诉我，毛泽东同志在众多的身经百战的我军将领中选中了肖劲光同志当海军司令员，除了毛主席比较了解肖劲光同志的领导才干之外，另一个重要的因素就是肖劲光曾两次赴苏留学，了解苏联的情况，可以更好地借鉴苏联建设海军的经验。肖劲光同志几次赴苏商谈我国海军建设问题以及商洽海军所用武器装备等事项。但他不囿于苏联的经验，而致力于积极探索。他与海军其他领导同志一起，仅用了五六年时间，便完成了海军的创建任务。至１９５６年，先后建立了东海舰队、南海舰队、青岛基地、旅顺基地。战斗力量从空中到海上，从水面到水下，从海岛到海岸，初步形成了防御体系。并且在边组建边战斗的过程中与陆空军配合，收复了除台、澎、金、马外的沿海各岛屿。新中国的海军从无到有，在短短几年时间里取得令人瞩目的巨大成就，全国人民为之振奋。
    １９５７年９月，我与聂帅、陈赓同志到莫斯科，经过谈判与苏方签订了火箭和航空等新技术的协定。这个协定中有海军所需的两型导弹。肖劲光同志得知后甚为高兴，他认为这是海军获得新技术的良好开端。同年１１月，他随中国军事代表团赴苏参加十月革命四十周年庆典期间，与苏方海军领导人和一些专家围绕海军新技术问题进行了数次商谈，为１９５９年中苏两国签订的海军技术协定奠定了基础。
    我国三年经济暂时困难时期，苏联政府撤走专家，撕毁合同，给海军建设带来了严重困难。肖劲光同志与海军其他领导同志一起认真贯彻党的独立自主自力更生的方针，带领海军指战员克服困难，攻克难关，保证了海军建设各项事业的发展。十年内乱期间，肖劲光与绝大多数老同志一样，也吃了苦头，他先是受林彪、李作鹏一伙的迫害，后又遭张春桥、江青等人的诬陷。尽管如此，他始终以坚强的党性和百折不挠的毅力，排除干扰，埋头于海军建设，为党的事业而奋斗。
    在肖劲光的回忆录续集即将与读者见面之时，我将赠与他八十五寿辰而抄录的郑板桥的诗，再录如后：
    咬定青山不放松，立根原在破岩中。
    千磨万击还坚劲，任尔东西南北风。
    我想，这首以诗咏竹、以竹赞人的绝句，很能反映肖劲光的为人，赠与他无疑是合适的。
