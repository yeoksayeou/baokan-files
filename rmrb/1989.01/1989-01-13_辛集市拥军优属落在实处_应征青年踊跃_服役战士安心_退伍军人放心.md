Xinji City in Hebei Province has been committed to improving the welfare work in the new situation, diligently doing practical things for military personnel. This has been an important part of enhancing the national defense awareness among the people. Last year, the city was named a "National Advanced Unit for Supporting the Military and Preferential Treatment for Families" and a "Model Unit for Supporting the Military and Preferential Treatment for Families" in Hebei Province.

The people of Xinji, who have long been known for their enthusiasm in joining the war and supporting the military since the Anti-Japanese War, regard supporting the military and providing preferential treatment to families as their duty. Since 1985, the municipal Party committee and government have not only selected outstanding youths from among the thousands of recruits each year to send to the military and arranged for the resettlement of over 700 demobilized soldiers, but have also, based on local conditions, done several practical things for military personnel:

First, they have insisted on issuing subsidies to servicemen. The municipal Party committee and government have stipulated that the subsidy standard for conscripted soldiers should increase annually in line with the increase in local income. Statistics show that the average subsidy in the city was 318 yuan in 1985, and it reached 600 yuan in 1988.

Second, they have commended and rewarded those who have been decorated. Those who have been awarded first or second-class meritorious service medals are invited to attend a celebration organized by the city, where their families are informed with drums and gongs, and they are given reward money. Those who have been decorated in the military are given priority in job assignments after demobilization.

Third, they have established a marriage introduction agency for military personnel to help them find partners. Before the August 1st holiday last year, the municipal Women's Federation and the Civil Affairs Bureau organized a special television lecture on "Loving Contemporary Soldiers and Being Companions to Soldiers" throughout the city. The Women's Federation helped 215 unmarried soldiers and those from difficult family backgrounds find suitable partners.

Fourth, they have rationally developed and utilized dual-use talents. The Xinji municipal government established a "Dual-Use Talent Development Center," and each township has a dual-use talent introduction office. They have adopted the methods of recommending some, training some, and supporting some for demobilized soldiers returning to their hometowns, ensuring that everyone's talents are fully utilized. Over the past three years, more than 1,800 demobilized soldiers with special skills in the military have been recommended to work in municipal and enterprise units. The city has also used the method of holding training classes to enable more than 4,000 demobilized soldiers to learn the skills of getting rich.

　　辛集市拥军优属落在实处
    应征青年踊跃　服役战士安心　退伍军人放心
    本报讯  河北省辛集市坚持把搞好新形势下的优抚工作，扎扎实实为军人办实事，作为增强全民国防观念的一项重要内容。去年这个市被评为“全国拥军优属先进单位”和河北省“拥军优属标兵单位”。
    早在抗日战争时期就享有“踊跃参战，拥军支前”盛誉的辛集人民，把拥军优属作为自己应尽的义务。自１９８５年以来，市委、市政府，除每年从数千名应征青年中筛选优秀青年输送到部队，接收和安置７００余名退伍军人外，还从当地的实际出发，切实为军人办了几件实事：一是坚持为服役战士发优待金。市委、市政府规定，对义务兵战士的优待金标准，随当地收入的上升幅度逐年递增。据统计：１９８５年全市平均优待金为３１８元，１９８８年达到６００元。二是表彰立功受奖人员。荣立一等功或二等功的同志，由市里组织召开庆功会，除敲锣打鼓向其亲属报喜外，还发给奖金。凡在部队荣立过战功的，退伍后优先安排工作。三是成立了军人婚姻介绍所，为军人牵线搭桥。去年“八一”前夕，由市妇联和民政局牵头，在全市范围内举办了“爱当代军人，做军人伴侣”的专题电视演讲会。市妇联为２１５名大龄军人和家庭比较困难的军人找到了如意伴侣。四是合理开发使用两用人才。辛集市政府设立了“两用人才开发中心”，各乡镇均有两用人才介绍所。他们对退伍回乡的战士采用推荐一部分，培训一部分，扶持一部分的办法，使人尽其才。三年来，已有１８００余名在部队学有专长者被推荐到市、企业单位工作。市里还采用举办培训班的方法，使４０００余名退伍军人学到了致富的本领。
