	Gao Qiao
	Painting by Han Yu	Poetry by Wang Yuxiang

	For ten years, he donned the monkey's disguise,
	Now, in the White Tiger Hall, he wears the insignia of a high official.
	Who dares to laugh at Gao the Second of Bianliang?
	His skill in kicking the ball surpasses that of scholarly scent.

    高俅
    韩羽　画  王玉祥　诗
    十年浮浪沐猴妆，
    一品威仪白虎堂。
    敢笑汴梁高老二？
    踢球端比读书香。
