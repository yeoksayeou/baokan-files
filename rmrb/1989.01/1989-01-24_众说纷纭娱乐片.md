Since 1988, the production of domestic narrative films has seen a surge in entertainment films. Various studios have produced some good entertainment films, but a significant number of works are poorly made. Therefore, opinions from various sectors of society on the entertainment film boom are divided. This phenomenon reflects changes in the social economic structure, challenging traditional cultural ethics and artistic concepts, and involving a series of issues such as human psychology, social benefits, cultural construction, and the role of mass media. Consequently, discussions on entertainment films have been heated, with various opinions mainly focusing on the following topics:

On the background and significance of the entertainment film boom. Some people believe that the entertainment film boom is a necessary result of the development of Chinese history and culture, marking an important transformation in film culture and concepts. This transformation accompanies the all-around transformation of China's economy and culture, and its significance even surpasses the rectification of the film industry in the new era over the past decade. Conversely, others argue that film culture should not undergo such a transformation. It should continue to cultivate people's noble sentiments and inspire them to strive forward. There are vulgar elements in entertainment films, and their significance should not be overestimated. Some point out that in the past, our lives lacked entertainment, which was caused by political turmoil and economic hardship. This is not a sign of social progress, and it is time to change this situation. Entertainment films should be given a dominant position in film creation. Films can educate the people and instill a sense of crisis, but it is not necessary to make this the sole responsibility of art. Some oppose the dominance of entertainment films and believe that as part of the construction of socialist Chinese film culture, a batch of works that embody the mainstream ideology of the state and the people, confront life, and open up the future should be the backbone. These works should prepare the conditions for modernizing construction and create a cultural environment.

On the status of entertainment films. Some people believe that entertainment films are on par with art films. The reason why domestic entertainment films are of poor quality is related to our cultural tradition of emphasizing education and neglecting entertainment, to some studio leaders' disregard for entertainment films, and to the theoretical circle's emphasis on exploratory films while neglecting entertainment films. A creator of exploratory films revealed: The initial intention of shooting those famous exploratory films was to make entertainment-type narrative films to attract audiences. However, due to weak scriptwriting and lack of good stories, they had to use good visuals and cinematography to supplement, inadvertently becoming "dull plots," which were praised by the theoretical circle, leading to further extremes and making it difficult for audiences to engage. Others point out: The view that art films can enter film history while entertainment films cannot is wrong. No country treats propaganda films and art films as the mainstay of film production. Film history is mainly the history of entertainment films. Conversely, others believe that only the development of artistic forms can constitute film history. Exploratory films have developed film language, so film history is the history of art films. Some point out that it is abnormal to have awards only for art films and not for entertainment films. Entertainment films should also have their own masters, such as Charlie Chaplin and Alfred Hitchcock. However, others believe that the emphasis on the production of entertainment films and the improvement of their quality should be distinguished from the elevation of the status of entertainment films. Improperly elevating the status of entertainment films will lead to the non-popularization, non-massification, and incoherence of entertainment film production, effectively canceling out entertainment films.

Many opinions suggest clarifying the concept and semantics of entertainment films. Some believe that films about murder, detective stories, martial arts, dance, and comedy belong to entertainment films, while serious themes, social criticism, and educational films are unrelated to entertainment films. Some believe that films aiming to express the self are art films, while films aiming to entertain the audience are entertainment films. Others believe that the term "entertainment film" is not scientific and suggest using "entertainment in films" instead.

For this reason, some theorists have compared the similarities and differences between art films and entertainment films: Entertainment films belong to popular culture and conform to linguistic norms, while exploratory films belong to elite culture and rebel against linguistic norms; entertainment films conform to the mainstream ideology, while exploratory films rebel against the mainstream ideology; entertainment films emphasize storytelling and causal relationships, while art films reject storytelling and disrupt causal relationships; entertainment films follow traditional moral and emotional patterns, while art films rebel against traditional moral and emotional patterns; entertainment films make the audience assimilate to the film, while art films create a distance between the audience and the film. Regarding the relationship between art films and entertainment films, some creators believe that the thick wall between the two types of films should be demolished, and entertainment and art should be fused into one. Others believe that the two should be distinguished, otherwise, they will influence and hinder each other.

On the ideology of entertainment films. One view is that entertainment films should have some ideological content, but this content should be simple and fresh. Another view is that entertainment films should not bear philosophical burdens.

On the function of entertainment films. Some believe that they should provide substitute sexual satisfaction for the audience, allowing them to vent their desires through the film. Entertainment films should not avoid sexual issues. Conversely, others believe that entertainment films should have cultural taste and refinement. Vulgar depictions of sex will lower the overall cultural quality of the people, so the number of sex scenes and violent films should be reduced.

On how to improve the quality of entertainment films and attract audiences. Some believe that the improvement of entertainment film quality first requires the perfection of genres and the production of entertainment films that better conform to the unique models of various genres. Because not adhering to the grammatical rules of genre films is the main reason for losing the audience, one should first master the rules and then reverse and transcend them. Others point out that the improvement of entertainment film appearances first lies in scriptwriting. Entertainment film scriptwriters should follow the principles of popular literature, achieving two "musts" and three "must nots": must have a tight plot, must have a unique selling point, must not have complex character personalities, must not have artistic language, and must not have profound themes. Some oppose this view, believing that using such Chinese methods for scriptwriting and filmmaking will ultimately harm the quality and reputation of entertainment films. Some creators point out that entertainment films need good packaging, such as good cinematography, sound recording, editing, and sound effects. Regarding the performance in entertainment films, everyone agrees that a star system should be established, with specific stars for each genre. Stars should be introduced anew with the changing tastes of the times. Regarding the criticism of entertainment films, some propose that entertainment films should not be analyzed using non-entertainment film theories. There should be strengthened specialized research on various styles of entertainment film theories (i.e., genre film theories).

Currently, the discussion on entertainment films is continuing to deepen along with the expansion of entertainment film production.

　　众说纷纭娱乐片
    张卫
    １９８８年以来，国产故事片生产中出现了娱乐片热，各制片厂都拍出了一些较好的娱乐片，但也有相当一部分作品粗制滥造，因而社会各界对娱乐片热的看法不一。加之这一现象的出现反映了社会经济结构的变化，冲击着传统文化的伦理价值和文艺观念，涉及到人性心理、社会效益、文化建设、大众传播媒介作用等一系列问题，因而针对娱乐片众说纷纭、讨论热烈，各种意见主要围绕以下话题交锋：
    关于娱乐片热的背景和意义。有人认为，娱乐片热是中国历史文化发展的必然结果，是电影文化与电影观念发展中的一次非常重要的转型，因为它伴随着中国经济文化的全方位转型而出现，其意义甚至超过电影界新时期十年的拨乱反正。相反意见认为，电影文化没有也不应出现转型，它依然是陶冶人们美好情操，鼓舞人们积极向上的精神力量，娱乐片中有低级庸俗的成份，对其意义的估价不应过高。有人指出，过去我们的生活缺乏娱乐，是由政治动乱和经济穷困造成的，这不是社会文明进步的表现，如今到了转变这一现象的时候了，应该确立电影创作中的娱乐片主体地位。电影可以教育人民，可以给人民灌输忧患意识，但没有必要将此当作艺术的唯一责任。有人反对以娱乐片为主体，并且认为，作为社会主义中国的电影文化建设，没有一批体现国家和人民的主流意识形态、直面人生、开拓未来的主旋律作品做中坚，为现代化建设准备人的条件、开创文化环境是不行的。
    关于娱乐片的地位。有人认为娱乐片与艺术片难分高下，国产娱乐片之所以质量差，与我们重教化、轻娱乐的文化传统不无关系，与部分制片厂领导轻视它，只派素质较差、水平低的人员拍摄它不无关系，与理论界重视探索片轻视娱乐片不无关系。一位探索片创作人员透露：那几部著名探索片的拍摄初衷是想搞娱乐型故事片争取观众的，但因为编剧薄弱，没有好故事，只好用好的画面、好的摄影来补充，歪打正着地成了“淡化情节”，被理论界一捧，就越发地不顾娱乐性而走极端，让观众很难进入。还有人指出：认为艺术电影能进电影史，娱乐片不能进电影史的看法是错误的，没有一个国家把宣教片和艺术片当作电影生产主体的，电影史主要还是娱乐片的历史。相反意见认为，只有艺术形式的发展才能构成艺术史，探索电影发展了电影语言，所以电影史是艺术电影史。有人指出只有艺术片奖没有娱乐片奖是不正常的，娱乐片也应有自己的大师，如卓别林、希区柯克。但相反意见认为，应把重视娱乐片的制作，提高它的质量与提高娱乐片的地位区分开来，不恰当地提高娱乐片地位，反会导致娱乐片拍摄的非通俗化、非大众化和不伦不类，实际上等于取消了娱乐片。
    不少意见认为应该廓清娱乐片的概念和语义。有人认为谋杀、侦破、武打、歌舞、喜剧之类属娱乐片，严肃题材、针砭时弊、宣传教育的影片与娱乐片无关。有人认为以表现自我为目的的影片是艺术片，以愉悦观众为目的的影片是娱乐片。还有人认为娱乐片的提法不科学，应以提“电影的娱乐性”为宜。
    为此，一些理论家比较了艺术片与娱乐片的异同：娱乐片属大众文化，归顺语言规范，探索片属精英文化，逆反语言规范；娱乐片认同主流意识形态，探索片悖逆主流意识形态；娱乐片讲求故事，注重因果联系，艺术片反故事，打断因果联系；娱乐片遵循传统道德情感模式，艺术片逆反传统道德情感模式；娱乐片使观众向影片同化，艺术片让观众与影片间离。关于艺术片与娱乐片的关系，有的创作人员认为应该拆除两种影片之间的厚墙，熔娱乐与艺术于一炉。有人则认为应把二者区分开来，否则互相影响，彼此妨碍。
    关于娱乐片的思想性。一种意见认为，娱乐片应有一定思想内涵，但这内涵应浅显、新鲜。另一种意见认为，娱乐片不应负载哲理。
    关于娱乐片的功能。有人认为，它应给观众以替代式的性满足，观众借影片宣泄情欲，娱乐片不应回避性问题。相反意见认为，娱乐片应有文化格调、文化品位，庸俗地表现性，会降低全民文化质量，所以应减少性镜头和凶杀片数量。
    关于如何提高娱乐片质量，如何吸引观众。有人认为，娱乐片质量的提高首先有待于完善类型，有待于将娱乐片拍得更符合各个类型电影的特有模式。因为不遵守类型电影的语法规律是失去观众的主要原因，首先应该熟悉掌握规则，然后才能逆反超越规则。还有人指出，娱乐片面貌的改观，首先在于编剧工作，娱乐片编剧应遵守通俗文学的原则，做到二要三不要：要有扣（指情节上的环环相扣），要有绝招，不要人物性格复杂化，不要语言艺术性，不要深奥主题。有人则反对这种观点，认为用这种中国土办法编剧拍片最终会损害娱乐片的质量和声誉。有的创作人员指出，娱乐片要有好的外包装，即好的摄影、录音、剪辑、声音等。关于娱乐片的表演，大家认为应该建立明星制，每一类型片应有它特定的明星，应随着时代审美趣味的迁移，重新推出明星。关于娱乐片的评论，有人提出不能用非娱乐片理论分析娱乐片，应加强对各种式样娱乐片理论（即类型片理论）的专门研究。
    目前，娱乐片的讨论正伴随着娱乐片的生产的扩大而继续深入。
