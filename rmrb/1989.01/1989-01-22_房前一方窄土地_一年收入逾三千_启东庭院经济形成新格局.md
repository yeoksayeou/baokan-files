The courtyard economy in the rural areas of Qidong County, Jiangsu Province, has thrived. In 1988, the total income from the courtyard economy reached nearly 200 million yuan, accounting for one-third of the county's total agricultural income, and has become a major pillar of the rural economy.

Qidong County is located on the banks of the Yangtze River and the coast of the Yellow Sea. With limited land and a large population, farmers have focused on improving large-scale field planting while actively utilizing the land in front of their houses to develop a courtyard economy that requires minimal investment, can be started quickly, and yields high returns. Farmers along the rivers and coastlines mainly engage in aquaculture, breeding clams, laver, and prawns. Inland areas focus on raising pigs, sheep, chickens, rabbits, and ducks. High-sand areas mainly cultivate mulberry trees and raise silkworms, making it the largest silkworm and mulberry production area in the county.

The development of the courtyard economy has increased commercialization and specialization. Located on the banks of the Yangtze River, Bai Gang Village has over 800 households that cultivate "Kyoho" and "Red Fuji" grapes in their courtyards. Under the grape trellises, they raise chickens and pigs. Each year, the entire village supplies 250,000 kilograms of high-quality grapes to urban and rural markets. The annual courtyard income from grape cultivation alone reaches over 600,000 yuan, with an average household income of around 3,000 yuan.

　　房前一方窄土地　一年收入逾三千
    启东庭院经济形成新格局
    本报讯  江苏启东县农村庭院经济蓬勃兴起，１９８８年农村庭院经济的总收入近２亿元，占全县农业总收入的１／３，成为农村经济的一大支柱。
    启东县位于长江下游黄海之滨，地少人多，农民在抓好大田种植的同时，利用家前屋后积极发展投资少、上马快、效益高的庭院经济。沿江沿海一带的农户以水产养殖为主，发展养殖文蛤、紫菜、对虾等水产品；内地以饲养猪、羊、鸡、兔、鸭等为主的畜禽；高沙土地区以种桑养蚕为主，是全县规模最大的蚕桑生产地区。
    发展庭院经济，提高了商品化、专业化。位于长江边的白港村８００多个户头在庭院内种植了“巨峰”、“红富士”良种葡萄，葡萄架下养鸡、养猪，每年全村为城乡市场提供良种葡萄２５万公斤，以种葡萄为主的年庭院收入６０多万元，户均收入３０００元左右。
