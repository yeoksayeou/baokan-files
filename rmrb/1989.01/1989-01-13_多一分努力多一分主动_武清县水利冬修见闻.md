		A Little More Effort, A Little More Initiative
		– Observations on Winter Water Conservancy Repair in Wuqing County
		Xiao Junxi, People’s Daily Reporter

		In the depths of winter, visiting Tianjin’s Wuqing County to see the water conservancy repairs was not the best time. The fields were quiet, with only a few people occasionally seen by the canals, pumping water and irrigating the land. The car drove for half a day before encountering a group of people breaking ice and repairing canals, and these were teachers volunteering on a Sunday. However, upon closer inspection, there was much to be seen. The fields in the southern and southeastern parts of the county had long, straight canals every 50 meters or so, over a meter deep and three meters wide, with new earth piled high on the banks. In the northern part, there were scattered white cylindrical objects, which, upon inquiry, were found to be water supply valves for underground pipelines. The irrigation canals in the fields were as straight as the drainage canals, but narrower and slightly higher than the field surface. The irrigated wheat fields were a dark green with a thin layer of ice, while the large fields were a yellowish-black. All of this seemed like a battlefield after a victory, with the soldiers withdrawn and the “spoils” scattered everywhere. It seems that both doing and observing require practicality. Loud and enthusiastic as well as quiet and calm surface phenomena can both give people the wrong impression. The hosts told us that in October and November of last year, the entire county mobilized over 200,000 people and 3,500 machines and vehicles to repair and build over 5,300 kilometers of various canals, laying 506 kilometers of underground water pipelines. The above-ground and underground water supply and drainage canal and pipeline networks have initially taken shape, restoring and improving the drainage area by 630,000 mu, and expanding and improving the irrigation area by 400,000 mu. County Party Secretary Xu confidently said, “If we encounter last year’s waterlogging or the drought of previous years, we will no longer be so passive.”

		Wuqing is located between Beijing and Tianjin. Although half of the rural labor force has shifted to secondary and tertiary industries, it remains an agricultural county with 1.43 million mu of arable land, 900,000 mu of which is used for grain. Before last year, grain production increased by 40 million kilograms annually, with a yield of 461 kilograms per mu. However, the waterlogging last summer and autumn caused great suffering. Large and small pumping stations worked at full capacity to drain water, but the water in the canals was drained, and the water in many fields rose but did not recede. The drainage canals were silted up, and the water could not flow out. Just as the lush green corn turned into “red pants and white undershirts,” the cotton was flooded, and vegetables could not be planted. After the autumn harvest, the accounts were tallied: 1.2 million mu of land were affected, grain production decreased by 1.5 billion kilograms, and direct economic losses amounted to 1.5 billion yuan. On average, each farmer lost 200 yuan and 200 kilograms of grain, not to mention the seeds, fertilizers, and labor they invested; this loss was greater than the national investment in water conservancy in the county over the past 30 years.

		The county leaders were shocked, and the farmers’ losses and pain were even more heart-wrenching. Water conservancy was no longer something that could be done or not done. But to make all the farmers in the county realize this and take action consciously, everyone was at a loss. After all, doing anything is more profitable than digging ditches. This time, before the wheat harvest, arrangements were made for water conservancy repairs, but there was hardly any response. The county committee could not sit idly by. Secretary Xu said firmly, “If we cannot win the battle of water conservancy, it shows that the county committee has no fighting power and is unworthy of the Party and the people.” The county committee came up with two strategies: first, the committee members went to various townships and villages to set examples and use facts to persuade people. Ganqiao Village in Nanqiao Township has four large low-lying areas. In the past, whenever it rained, boats could be floated in the fields. Last year, during the rainy season, they drained over 500,000 tons of water from the fields, saving the crops. The corn yield per mu increased from 365 kilograms last year to 463 kilograms, with an annual yield of 950 kilograms per mu. The county committee invited them to share their experiences at a cadre meeting: they insisted on dredging every year, with water conservancy facilities in place, and could drain and irrigate in time. While others reduced production, they increased it, and the benefits of water conservancy were evident. The second strategy was to leverage political advantages—party members, cadres, especially leading cadres, took the lead. The county, from the secretary and mayor to the car drivers, as long as they were “public servants,” each person was responsible for 10 cubic meters of earth in Yangcun Town for voluntary labor, digging 250,000 cubic meters of earth in three days and building 19 standard canals. This time, the township and village cadres could not sit still. The farmers also thought: why are the iron rice bowls digging canals? Isn’t it for us farmers? Thus, those with strength contributed strength, those with money contributed money, and some even paid in advance and worked later, getting their “deposit” back after completing the work. The entire county raised 630 million yuan. Suddenly, the masses rose up. Many people said this was a scene they hadn’t seen in decades.

		The enthusiasm of the masses is precious and must be protected. The most effective way to do this is to emphasize science and seek results. Therefore, the county committee stipulated that all projects must be planned and designed by water conservancy technical personnel at all levels. The county committee also gave them an “imperial edict”—no matter who built the project, it was invalid without their signature. This also curbed some who came up with numbers by slapping their heads. Initially, there were date-shaped, donkey-trough-shaped, and shallow-dish-shaped canals, and some were even built by “officials.” Without the water official’s signature, they had to be rebuilt to standard before they were considered complete. This forced some township cadres to carry homemade soil level gauges with them, measuring as they went. The county’s leaders and technical personnel, during those days, almost never left their cars, going to various townships and villages to inspect and guide, and they didn’t hold fewer on-site, technical exchanges, and inspections. This effectively ensured the quality of the projects.

		Last year there was waterlogging, and what about this year? No one can control the weather, and the county committee is clear about this. The northwestern part of the county is relatively high, focusing on developing and improving well irrigation benefits, laying underground water pipelines, and accelerating the configuration and equipment renewal of over 6,000 machine wells. The township enterprises in Hexiwu Township contributed 800,000 yuan to water conservancy construction, drilling 23 new wells, renovating old wells, and expanding the irrigation area by several thousand mu. Xiawuqi Township, under the guidance of relevant units, established a 10,000-mu low-pressure plastic pipe water supply area, and there is also a computer-controlled water experiment. The farmers were very enthusiastic, investing over 2.6 million yuan, and also leveled the land, and the open canals were concreted, saving water, electricity, and labor. The county’s underground pipeline irrigation area has reached 136,000 mu, and there are over 800 sets of mobile sprinkler equipment, which can irrigate seven or eight million mu.

		The winter repairs have already shown results, with canals unblocked, lift irrigation water speeding up, and over 500,000 mu of wheat fields already irrigated. Large fields have used guest water to irrigate over 200,000 mu. Spring drought and winter resistance. Farmers saw the benefits, and their morale was higher. Each township and village is raising funds for the matching projects. The approximately 900 million yuan needed for the construction of bridges, culverts, and sluices in the entire county has basically been secured. Once the ground thaws, this place will be bustling again.

　　多一分努力多一分主动
    ——武清县水利冬修见闻
    本报记者  萧俊熙
    隆冬，到天津武清县看修水利，真不是时候，地里静悄悄的，偶尔有三五个人在渠边抽水、灌地，汽车跑了半天，才碰上一群人在破冰修渠，还是教师们利用周日公休，义务劳动。但仔细看，却很有名堂。南部、东南部路间的方田，每５０多米便有一条笔直的长长渠道，一米多深，三米多宽，渠岸高垒着新翻的泥土；北部一些土地上，散落着一个个白色筒状物，一问，方知是地下输水管道的给水栓；方田里灌溉渠道同排涝渠一样笔直，只是窄小些且略高于田面；浇灌过的麦田苍绿中泛着薄冰的白光，大田则黄中透黑。这一切，好像打了胜战后的战场，战士撤出了，“战利品”则随处可见。看来，干与看都得求实，轰轰烈烈和冷冷清清的表面现象都同样会给人错觉。主人告诉我们，去年１０月和１１月，全县出动２０多万人、３５００多台机械、车辆，新修和整修各种渠道５３００多公里，地下输水管道铺设到了５０６公里，地上、地下输、排水渠、管道网络初步形成，恢复改善除涝面积６３万亩，扩大和改善灌溉面积４０万亩。县委徐书记不无自信地说：“如果再遇到去年的沥涝和前几年的干旱，我们就不会那么被动了。”
    武清位于京、津之间，农村多半劳力虽已转入二三产业，但仍然是农业大县，１４３万亩耕地中９０万亩种粮。去年以前，粮食产量每年以４０００万公斤速度递增，单产达到４６１公斤。可是，去年夏秋季的沥涝害苦了人，大小扬水站开足马力抽水，干渠里的水抽干了，许多地里的水都见涨不见消，排涝渠淤塞，水出不来。眼看穿绿着翠的玉米换成了“红裤衩白背心”，棉花淹了，菜种不下去。秋后一算账：１２０万亩地受灾，粮食减产１．５亿公斤，直接经济损失１．５亿元，平均每个农民减收２００元、２００公斤粮食，还没算他们投入的种子、肥料、劳力等；这个损失大于３０多年来国家对全县的水利投资。
    县领导震惊了，农民的损失、悲痛更让人揪心，水利再不是可干可不干的事了，但要让全县农民认清这一点，自觉行动，大家心里都没谱。因为，干什么都比挖土方来钱。这不，麦收前作了修水利的布置，愣没多少动静。县委坐不住了，徐书记斩钉截铁地说：“水利这一仗打不好，说明县委没有战斗力，愧对党和人民。”县委拿出两条对策：一是委员们分头到各乡村抓典型，用事实来说服人。南蔡村乡的甘桥村有四片大洼地，过去一遇下雨，地里能撑船。去年雨季，他们从地里排除了５０多万吨水，保住了庄稼，玉米亩产由上年的３６５公斤增加到４６３公斤，全年单产９５０公斤。县委请他们在干部会上介绍经验：年年坚持清淤，水利设施配套，能及时排水灌水。众人减产，他增产，水利效益，令人折服。第二个对策是发挥政治优势——党员、干部，特别是领导干部带头。县里从书记、县长到汽车司机只要姓“公”，每人１０方土，在杨村镇义务劳动，三天挖土２．５万方，修标准渠１９条。这一下，乡村干部坐不住了。农民也寻思：铁饭碗修渠为啥？还不是为咱农民。于是，有力的出力，有钱的出钱，甚至先掏钱后干活，干完活再领回“押金”，全县集中资金６３０万元。呼啦一下子，群众起来了。许多人说，这是十几年没见过的阵势。
    群众的积极性可贵，要保护，最有效的保莫过于讲科学，求实效。因此，县委规定所有工程都由各级水利技术干部统一规划、设计，县委还给了他们“尚方宝剑”——不管是谁做的工程，没有他们验收签字一律无效。这又制住了少数拍脑门儿就出数字的人。起初，曾出现过枣木式、驴槽式、浅碟式的渠，有些还是“官们”做的，水官员不签字，硬是重修达标才算数。这逼得一些乡干部随身带着自制土测标器，走到哪里量到哪里。县里的领导和技术干部在那些日子里，几乎车不离身地到各乡村检查、指导，也没少开现场、技术交流、检查等“飞行会”。有效地保证了工程的质量。
    去年沥涝，今年又怎样呢？谁也当不了老天爷的家，县委是清醒的。西北部地势较高，重点发展和提高井灌效益，铺地下输水管道，６０００多眼机井配套和设备更新正加紧进行。河西务乡乡镇企业拿出８万元支持水利建设，新打井２３眼，老井作了改造，扩大灌溉面积几千亩。下伍旗乡在有关单位主持指导下，建立起万亩低压塑料管道输水区，还有微机监控水试验。农民可热心了，投入２６万多元，还把土地平整了一遍，明渠作了水泥衬砌，节水省电省工。全县暗管输水灌溉面积已有１３．６万亩，还有８００多套移动式喷灌设备，可保浇七八万亩。
    冬修已初见成效，渠道畅通，提灌水加速，５０万亩麦田已浇过了，大田利用客水灌了２０多万亩。春旱冬抗。农民看到了效益，劲头更大了，各乡村都在筹措配套工程所需的资金。全县所需约９００万元桥、涵、闸的建设资金已基本落实，待大地解冻，这里又将是一番热闹景象。
