The collection of plum blossom paintings by Wang Chengxi has been published, and I am genuinely pleased to see this album come to light.

In recent years, Chengxi's calligraphy and painting works, especially his plum blossoms, have increasingly attracted the attention and admiration of people both domestically and internationally. Last summer, I saw Chengxi's new work—a large-scale painting titled "Red Plum Blossoms Fragrant from Afar"—hanging in the guest hall of the Speaker's residence in the Japanese Diet. Both I and Mr. Li Xiongcai, who accompanied me, were thrilled and excited upon seeing this painting, deeming it a masterpiece of contemporary middle-aged painters! From the perspective of the painting, the sturdy old trunk, the vigorous new branches, the vibrant flowers, and the skilled techniques and profound artistic conception, all of these elements have reached a new height in his creations. As someone who has personally witnessed Chengxi's steady progress, I feel greatly gratified.

Chengxi's paintings are grounded in a solid foundation of calligraphy. Based on traditional techniques, he strives to integrate Western painting methods such as perspective, light and shadow, space, and texture into the aesthetic of Chinese ink and brushwork, aiming to achieve an artistic effect that combines form and spirit. This has resulted in his distinctive, lively, and widely appreciated artistic style. Although the theme of plum blossoms has been frequently depicted by countless famous artists throughout history, the works presented to us are uniquely different, refreshing, and imbued with the spirit of the times, providing a sense of vibrant beauty that marks a new stage in the history of Chinese plum blossom painting.

I have known Chengxi for twenty years. I admire his sincere and straightforward character. His perseverance in learning and relentless spirit of research are truly inspiring. For a single flower, a bird, or a composition, he often practices and contemplates under the lamp for dozens or even hundreds of times, always seeking advice from others and never satisfied. He greatly appreciates the lines from Lu You's poem, "A sharp sword's edge comes from grinding, the fragrance of plum blossoms comes from enduring the cold," often inscribing them on his paintings and hanging them in his room as a motto. Indeed, starting from a humble background, he has diligently cultivated his art, reaping today's harvest, which embodies his unwavering pursuit and hardships.

### 梅花香自苦寒来——读《王成喜画梅集》

　　梅花香自苦寒来
    ——读《王成喜画梅集》
    董寿平
    《王成喜画梅集》和大家见面了，这本画册的问世，使我由衷地感到高兴。
    这些年，成喜的书画作品，尤其是梅花，越来越受到国内外人士的瞩目和喜爱。去年夏天，我在日本众议院看到成喜的新作——巨幅《红梅香远图》，悬挂在议长官邸贵宾厅。我和一同前往的黎雄才先生，乍一看到这幅画，都不禁兴奋和激动，惊为当代中年画家的杰作！从画面看那苍劲的老干，刚健的新枝，充满活力的花朵以及技法的熟练和意境的深邃等，在他的创作中都迈入了一个新的高度。我作为亲眼看着成喜一步一步脚踏实地走过来的人，感到十分欣慰。
    成喜的画，有厚实的书法功底，在传统技法的基础上，努力把西画的透视、明暗、空间、质感等表现方法融于中国画的笔墨趣味中，以追求形神兼备的艺术效果，形成了他鲜明生动、雅俗共赏的艺术风格。尽管梅花这个题材，是古今成百上千的名家所经常画的，然而展现在我们面前的这些作品，却是与众迥异，别开生面，洋溢着时代气息，给人一种生机盎然的美感享受，在我国画梅史上步入了一个新的阶段。
    我和成喜相识二十年了，我喜欢他的为人诚恳朴实，他那种水滴石穿的学习毅力和绳锯木断的钻研精神，是很感动人的。为了一朵花、一只鸟、一个构图，他常常在灯下几十遍、上百遍地揣磨练习，还到处求教，从不满足。他很喜欢陆放翁的“宝剑锋从磨砺出，梅花香自苦寒来”两句诗，经常题于画面，挂在室内，作为座右铭。的确，他从一个农家子弟开始，在艺术的苗圃里辛勤耕耘，从而得到今天的收获，凝结着多少执著的追求和艰辛啊！
