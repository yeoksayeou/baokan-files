	Soviet Foreign Minister Ends Visit to Kabul, Proposes New Round of Talks with Resistance Forces; Former Afghan King Calls on UN to Break the Deadlock

	Our correspondent in Islamabad, Ren Yu Jun, reports: According to foreign news agencies and local newspapers, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, during his two-day visit to Kabul, stated that the door for political negotiations to resolve the Afghan problem remains open. Those who refuse to accept the olive branch will be responsible for the future bloodshed and suffering of the Afghan people.

	During his two-day visit to Kabul, Shevardnadze held talks with Najibullah and other high-ranking officials of the Kabul government. He promised that if the fighting in Afghanistan does not stop after the Soviet withdrawal, the Soviet Union will continue to provide military aid to the Kabul government. He also said that Moscow and Kabul still hope that the Soviet troops will withdraw completely from Afghanistan by February 15. At the end of his visit, he proposed to the Afghan resistance forces to hold a new round of talks. He said, "We are not disappointed by the lack of a reasonable response."

	It is also reported that the commander of the Soviet forces in Afghanistan, General Gromov, said on January 15, "The Soviet withdrawal will be completed on schedule by February 15." "This is a sensitive issue that the whole world is concerned about, and of course, we are also concerned. The withdrawal plan and timetable have been determined."

	Both Shevardnadze and Vorontsov participated in the talks with the Kabul government. Shevardnadze returned to the Soviet Union on the afternoon of January 15.

	Our correspondent in Islamabad, Ren Yu Jun, reports: According to today's report in the Pakistani newspaper "Muslim," former Afghan King Zahir Shah has called on the United Nations to play a role in breaking the current political deadlock in resolving the Afghan problem.

	The report said that the former Afghan king recently told the French magazine "Le Point" in an interview that the United Nations has been silent on the Afghan issue for several months. Now that the political resolution of the Afghan problem has encountered difficulties, this international organization should step forward to play a role in promoting peace, so that the peace process can continue. He also said that the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan cannot participate in the future government, and the resistance forces will not accept it. As for himself, he said: "My return to Afghanistan has no preconditions, I am completely at the disposal of the Afghan people."

    本报伊斯兰堡１月１６日电  记者任毓骏报道：综合外电及当地报纸消息，苏联外长谢瓦尔德纳泽在访问喀布尔期间表示，为政治解决阿富汗问题的谈判大门依然开着，拒不接受橄榄枝的人将为今后阿富汗人的流血和苦难负责。
    谢瓦尔德纳泽在对喀布尔进行为期两天的访问期间，和纳吉布拉以及其他喀布尔政权高级官员举行了会谈。他曾许诺说，如果苏联撤军后阿富汗境内的战事依然不停止，苏联将继续向喀布尔政府提供军事援助。他还说，莫斯科和喀布尔仍然希望苏联军队按期于２月１５日完全撤离阿富汗。访问结束时，他向阿富汗抵抗力量提议双方举行新的一轮谈判。他表示，“我们对得到理智的答复并不感到失望。”
    另据报道，苏联驻阿富汗部队总司令格罗莫夫于１５日说：“苏联撤军将于２月１５日按时完成”。“这是一个全世界人人都关注的敏感问题，当然我们也关注。撤军计划和时间表已经确定”。
    谢瓦尔德纳泽和沃龙佐夫都参加了与喀布尔政权的会谈。谢瓦尔德纳泽已于１月１５日下午回到苏联。
    本报伊斯兰堡１月１６日电　记者任毓骏报道：据巴基斯坦《穆斯林报》今日消息，阿富汗前国王查希尔呼吁联合国发挥作用，打破目前政治解决阿富汗问题所面临的僵局。
    报道说，阿富汗前国王日前在接受法国《观点》杂志采访时说，联合国对阿富汗问题保持沉默已有数月，如今政治解决阿富汗问题出现困境，这个国际组织应当出面起促进作用，使和平进程得以继续。他还说，阿富汗人民民主党不能参加未来的政府，抵抗力量是不会接受的。至于他本人，他说：“我重返阿富汗没有任何先决条件，我完全听从阿富汗人民的安排。”
