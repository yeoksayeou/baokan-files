The largest railway classification yard in China—Zhengzhou North Station—has entered a new phase of operations starting this year. The classification and assembly of freight cars are now being handled by "computers" instead of "human brains."

Here, people can see that the operational control system composed of electronic computers, through on-site radar, light grids, and other measurement devices, continuously collects information such as the weight, speed, interval, resistance, and available track length of the car groups that have been released from the hump, as well as weather conditions. This information is then processed by automatic controllers to enter the classification tracks, where the freight cars are automatically and safely coupled together. The entire system consists of three HP-1000 type mainframe computers, connected to 25 intelligent terminals and other equipment, which are respectively set up at 30 production positions on-site. The system has 28 functions, including automatically generating and transmitting daily and shift operation plans for the station, automatically managing and querying the tens of thousands of freight cars at the classification yard, their types, stopping positions, loaded or empty status, and destinations, as well as automatically compiling transportation production indicators.

This freight car management information system, which is a key scientific and technological project during the "Seventh Five-Year Plan," has officially passed the national-level technical appraisal. After being put into use, it has achieved remarkable results. The speed of compiling train disassembly operation plans has increased by 35%, and the number of cars handled daily has exceeded the original design capacity of the station, thereby significantly expanding the overall transportation capacity of the railway network.

　　国家“七五”科技攻关项目    
    郑州北站货车编解自动化
    本报讯  我国最大的铁路编组站——郑州北站，从今年一开始货车的中转就进入了由“电脑”取代“人脑”进行列车解体、编组作业的新阶段。
    人们在这里看到，由电子计算机组成的作业控制系统，通过现场雷达、光栅等操测设备，不间断地采集从驼峰溜放下来车组的重量、速度、间隔、阻力以及股道空闲长度和气象条件等信息，经过自动控制的减速器进入编组线路，一列列货车自动、安全的连挂起来。整个系统由３台ＨＰ—１０００型电子计算机为主机，由此连接２５个智能终端及其它设备，分别设置在现场３０个生产岗位上，具有自动编制和传输车站日班作业计划和阶段作业计划，自动完成编组站数以万计货车的车种、停留位置、空重状态、去向品名等情况的掌握和查询，自动完成运输生产指标的统计等２８项功能。
    这项被国家列为“七五”期间重点科技攻关项目的货车管理信息系统已正式通过国家级技术鉴定，投入使用后收到显著成效，编制列车解体作业计划的速度比过去提高了３５％，日办理车数突破了原站场的设计能力，从而大大地扩大了全路运输能力。
