A recent issue of the Belgian weekly magazine "Tendances" compared the promotion of executives in several major countries of the European Community. The following is an introduction:

France: Emphasis on Degrees. High-ranking officials in large French companies generally must have received education from prestigious institutions. For a considerable period, only graduates from the National School of Administration and the School of Engineering were qualified to serve as general managers or chairmen of large companies. Today, this practice seems to have relaxed somewhat, and graduates from higher schools of commerce or even specialized commerce schools can gradually enter this circle. Outstanding individuals, once they enter the limited high-ranking official stratum, can move between large companies, banks, and government departments, holding important positions.

This system has produced a large number of economic analysts and planners with a strong strategic consciousness, but it also seriously affects the development of mid-level talent.

United Kingdom: Fast-Track Promotion System. Although the UK does not have specialized schools for cultivating high-level personnel like France, graduates from prestigious universities such as Oxford and Cambridge are also exceptional. After entering large companies, they have a strong sense of initiative and ambition. Companies put the best among them on a fast-track promotion path: allowing them to participate in all company activities, receive multi-faceted training, and gain various knowledge.

After two to three years of training, these individuals are promoted to higher-level positions. After further selection, training, and promotion, high-level talent quickly emerges.

West Germany: Emphasis on Technology First. All levels of employees in large West German companies must have received solid traditional technical training in universities or vocational schools.

Company managers must first be technical graduates. After starting work, they are often sent to research departments to work for a few years, and then learn management knowledge in practice. Their promotions are relatively slow, and even the best among them may reach the age of forty or even fifty before they can become managers.

This approach has three advantages: employees are loyal to the company; the leadership is easy to coordinate; and technical skills are continuously improved.

Italy: Value Technical Personnel. The heads of large companies often like to indicate their technical titles or doctoral degrees on their business cards. Large companies prefer technical management personnel. In the south, large companies affiliated with public departments have stable positions, and the promotion of personnel is closely related to political attitudes.

In the north, industrial and commercial enterprises are developed, and loyalty to the company is an important condition for promotion. Generally speaking, a competent manager must work enthusiastically, have strategic vision, and have the ability to make decisions quickly.

Belgium: Emphasis on Comprehensive Evaluation. For example, public opinion believes that a general manager must be a "doctor who can treat multiple diseases, not a specialist"; at least master two languages, etc.

To welcome the unified market after 1992, Western European companies face many problems that need to be solved, one of which is how to integrate different management and promotion systems. While maintaining their national characteristics, learning from the experiences of other countries is a topic that businesspeople are currently studying.

　　西欧企业管理人员升迁比较
    王淑娟
    比利时最近出版的《倾向》周刊，对欧洲共同体几个大国的企业管理人员的升迁作了一些比较，现介绍如下：
    法国：重文凭。法国大企业的高级官员一般必须在著名学府受过教育。在相当一个时期里，只有国立行政学院和理工学院的毕业生才有资格担任大企业的总经理、董事长。今天，这种作法似乎稍有松动，一些高等贸易学院、甚或贸易专科学校的毕业生也能逐渐挤进这个圈子。出类拔萃的人物一旦进入人数有限的高级官员阶层，便可以在大企业、银行、政府部门之间流动，担任要职。
    这种体制造就了一大批具有强烈战略意识的经济分析家与计划人材，但是也严重影响中级人材的发展。
    英国：实行快速晋升制度。英国虽没有法国那种培养高级人材的专门学校，但牛津、剑桥等名牌大学的毕业生也非等闲之辈。他们进大企业谋职后，进取心强，雄心勃勃。企业把其中的佼佼者直接引上快速晋升的道路：让他们参加企业的全部活动，接受多方面锻炼，获取各种学问。
    经过二至三年的培养，这些人便被提拔到更高一级职务。以后，再经过筛选、培养、晋升，使得高级人材很快脱颖而出。
    西德：强调技术第一。西德大企业的各级职员都必须在大学或职业学校受过基础扎实的传统技术培训。
    企业管理人员必须首先是位技术毕业生。工作后，往往先被派到研究部门工作几年，然后再在实践中学习管理知识。他们的晋级比较慢，其中最优秀者也得到四十岁、甚至五十岁，才能出任经理。
    这样做有三个好处：职员忠于企业；领导层易协调；技术本领不断提高。
    意大利：重视技术人员。大公司负责人往往喜欢在名片上标明技术职称或博士头衔。大企业喜欢的是技术型管理人材。在南方，隶属公共部门的大公司地位稳固，人员的晋升与政治态度密切相关。
    在北方，工商企业发达，忠于企业是晋升的重要条件。但总的讲一个称职的管理人员必须热情工作，具有战略眼光，有尽快作出决定的才干。
    比利时：注重综合考察。譬如，舆论认为，一个总经理必须是“能治疗多种疾病的医生，而不是专科医生”；至少掌握两门语言等。
    为了迎接一九九二年后的统一大市场，西欧大企业面临许多尚待解决的问题，其中之一就是如何融合不同的管理、晋级制度。既保持本国风格，又借鉴他国经验，这是企业家们正在研究的课题。
