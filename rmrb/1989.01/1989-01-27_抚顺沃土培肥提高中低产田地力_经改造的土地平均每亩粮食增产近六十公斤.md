Fushun Improves Soil Fertility to Enhance Productivity of Medium and Low-Yield Fields

	The transformed land increased grain production by nearly sixty kilograms per acre on average

	Xinhua News Agency. Fushun City in Liaoning Province increased grain production by 14.4 million kilograms in 1988 through a series of soil improvement measures.

	Located in the Liaodong mountainous region, Fushun City has 2.28 million acres of arable land. Due to geographical and natural conditions, the area of medium and low-yield fields is large, with grain yields generally only 150-200 kilograms per acre.

	In 1988, the Fushun Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government took soil improvement and enhancement of medium and low-yield fields as a strategic measure to develop agriculture. They allocated 1.1 million yuan from the local share of the arable land occupation tax as a special fund to transform 2.5 million acres of medium and low-yield fields. For this purpose, the city established a leading group and a technical guidance group, implementing a target management responsibility system. At the same time, the city also stipulated that medium and low-yield fields, after transformation and improvement of soil quality or dry land converted to paddy fields, would be exempt from agricultural tax for three years, and the increased income would be used for agricultural infrastructure construction. Agricultural production materials needed for treatment and transformation were also given priority supply. These measures greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of cadres and farmers.

	To ensure the quality of treatment and transformation work, Fushun City also actively carried out technical guidance work, establishing a three-level technical service network at the city, county, and township levels, and training nearly 10,000 backbone personnel and scientific and technological demonstration households.

	After transformation, the organic matter content of these lands has increased to varying degrees. According to statistics from 30 key townships and 70 scientific and technological demonstration households, the transformed land increased grain production by an average of 57.4 kilograms per acre, with a net increase in income of 15.4 yuan. It is understood that in 1989, Fushun City has implemented the transformation of 2 million acres of medium and low-yield fields.

　　抚顺沃土培肥提高中低产田地力    
    经改造的土地平均每亩粮食增产近六十公斤
    新华社电  辽宁省抚顺市去年靠一系列改良土质措施，增产粮食１４４０万公斤。
    地处辽东山区的抚顺市，共有耕地２２８万亩，由于地理位置和自然条件关系，中低产田面积很大，粮食单产一般只有１５０—２００公斤。
    １９８８年，抚顺市委、市政府把改土培肥，提高中低产田地力，作为发展农业后劲的战略措施来抓，并从耕地占用税地方留成部分中拿出１１０万元，作为专项基金，对２５万亩中低产田进行改造。为此，市里专门成立了领导小组和技术指导小组，实行目标管理责任制。与此同时，市里还规定，中低产田经改造提高地级或旱田改水田的，三年不征农业税，所增加的收益再用于农田基本建设。对治理改造所需农用生产资料也优先供给。这些措施大大调动了干部和农民的积极性。
    为保证治理改造工作的质量，抚顺市还积极抓好技术指导工作，建立了市、县、乡三级技术服务网，培训骨干和科技示范户近１万人。
    经过改造，这些土地有机质含量都有不同程度提高。据对３０个重点乡和７０个科技示范户统计，经过改造后的土地平均每亩增产粮食５７．４公斤，净增收入１５．４元。据了解，１９８９年，抚顺市又落实了２０万亩中低产田的改造任务。
