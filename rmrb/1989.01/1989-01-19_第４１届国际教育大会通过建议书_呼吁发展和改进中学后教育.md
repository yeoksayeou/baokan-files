The 41st International Education Conference, themed "Policies and Strategies for Post-Secondary Education," concluded today in Geneva. At the closing of the conference, a recommendation letter addressed to the education ministers of various countries was adopted, urging governments to vigorously develop and improve post-secondary education.

At this conference, hundreds of representatives from over 100 countries and regions fully affirmed the important role that post-secondary education plays in promoting and accelerating the cultural, economic, scientific, and technological development of contemporary society. Representatives believed that, although various governments have made efforts to develop post-secondary technical and vocational education, post-secondary education in both developed and developing countries faces various problems and challenges to different degrees. Many countries are preparing for new reforms in response to these issues.

Many representatives suggested expanding and increasing vocational education and training provided by non-university institutions, strengthening the diversification and professionalization of teaching plans, and making them better suited to the needs of economic life. This would promote the development of post-secondary education and training.

The conference opened on January 9th.

Vice Premier and Minister of the State Education Commission Li Tieying led the Chinese delegation to attend the conference.
