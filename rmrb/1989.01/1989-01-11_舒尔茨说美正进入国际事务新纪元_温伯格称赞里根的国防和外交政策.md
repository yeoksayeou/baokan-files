U.S. Secretary of State Schultz today said at a farewell reception held at the State Department that the United States is currently in a transitional period of new and old government teams and entering a new era in international affairs.

Schultz said, "As the elected President Bush has said, the post-war era has ended." He said that the fear of nuclear war has significantly diminished; the new U.S.-Soviet relations have brought hope for easing tensions between superpowers and more cooperative solutions to global problems.

However, he said, the United States still faces "new difficulties," including the proliferation of chemical weapons, global economic imbalances, terrorism, international drug trafficking, the asymmetric traditional military forces in Europe and other regions, and political, ethnic, and religious conflicts around the world. Nevertheless, he said, "Overall, the situation is optimistic."

Schultz pointed out that the view that the United States is declining and withdrawing from world affairs is wrong. He said, the United States can either be a source of progress, stability, and harmony, or stand by and watch conflicts, instability, and disorder in the international order.

Former U.S. Secretary of Defense Weinberger today said that the achievements of President Reagan in defense and diplomacy over the past eight years have left a "significant legacy" for the United States.

Weinberger reviewed the confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union in the 1970s and early 1980s. He said that Reagan had reversed a "quite dangerous situation" over the past eight years.

He said that it was precisely because the United States had become militarily stronger that the Soviet Union agreed to sign the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty and negotiate on other arms control issues. He urged Congress to provide more funding for the "Star Wars" program.

　　舒尔茨说美正进入国际事务新纪元
    温伯格称赞里根的国防和外交政策
    新华社华盛顿１月９日电  美国国务卿舒尔茨今天在国务院举行的离职告别招待会上说，美国目前正处于一个新老政府班子交接和进入国际事务新纪元的转折时期。
    舒尔茨说，“正如当选总统布什所说的，战后时期已经结束了”。他说，对于核战争的恐惧已经大大减小；新的美苏关系给超级大国间紧张气氛的缓和及更加合作地解决世界问题带来了希望。
    但是他说，美国仍面临着“新的困难”，包括化学武器的扩散、全球经济不平衡、恐怖主义、国际毒品走私、欧洲和其他地方危险的传统军事力量的不对称、以及世界范围内的政治、种族和宗教的冲突。然而他又说，“整个地说，情况是乐观的。”
    舒尔茨指出，认为美国正在衰落并从世界事务中退出的看法是错误的。他说，美国或者成为进步、稳定与和谐的一种源泉，或者对冲突、不稳定和国际秩序的紊乱袖手旁观。
    新华社华盛顿１月９日电　美国前国防部长温伯格今天说，里根总统执政８年来在国防和外交方面取得的成就给美国留下了“重大遗产”。
    温伯格回顾了７０年代和８０年代初美苏两国的对抗。他说，里根在过去８年中扭转了“相当危险的局面”。
    他说，正是因为美国在军事上更加强大，苏联才同意签署销毁中短程导弹条约，并就其他军备问题进行谈判。他呼吁国会给“星球大战”计划更多的拨款。
