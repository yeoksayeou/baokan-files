Edition: 5

Your newspaper published a letter from a reader and a photograph on the fifth edition of October 29, 1988, titled "If Only We Had a Few Classrooms, the Diligent Students Would Smile."

On October 31, we received instructions from the provincial government office to resolve the issue. The county committee decided: to solve the classroom problem of Mato Town Primary School within three days, temporarily using the conference room and other offices of the town government as classrooms. The town government must expedite the construction of the 16 classrooms currently under construction, which must be completed and put into use by the end of November.

Local and county leaders also visited the school to see the teachers and students.

Now, the teachers and students of Mato Town Primary School have joyfully moved into spacious and bright new classrooms.

    你报一九八八年十月二十九日第五版刊登了《安得教室数间，孜孜学童开颜》的读者来信和照片。
    十月三十一日，我们接到省政府办公厅要求解决问题的指示，县委决定：限期三天解决马头镇小学的教室问题，镇政府办公楼会议室等处暂作教室，镇政府要抓紧正建的十六间教室工程，必须在十一月底竣工，交付使用。
    地、县领导同志还专程到学校看望了师生。
