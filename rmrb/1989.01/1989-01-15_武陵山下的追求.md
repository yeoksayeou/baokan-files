In front of a small eatery, an old man selling medicine asked a soldier who was eating noodles, "Soldier, how much is a bowl of noodles? I didn't make much money selling medicine today. Can I have a bowl of noodles?"

The soldier bought two bowls of noodles for the old man, who then knelt down.

...

Whenever Huang Dianyu thinks about the scene he witnessed three years ago in Pengshui County, his heart is filled with emotion. At that time, he was a workshop director at the Changcheng Pharmaceutical Factory of the Beijing Military Region Rear Services Department. As he was about to be transferred, he learned that leaders from the Tujia and Miao Autonomous County of Yuyang in the southeastern corner of Sichuan Province were in Beijing seeking intellectual aid. He and several like-minded comrades decided to use Yuyang's medicinal herb resources to establish a pharmaceutical factory, planting a money tree for the local people.

After the news spread, some people did not understand: "Going to Shenzhen is to make money, going to the mountains is to make a show." Before making the choice, the five comrades had anticipated various comments and did not take them to heart. What they did not expect was that when it came to making the final decision, the greatest challenge would be overcoming oneself!

Huang Dianyu had many paths before him. As a military technical cadre, staying in the Changcheng Pharmaceutical Factory after being transferred seemed natural. "Going to the mountains?" Many people advised him not to be foolish.

Li Chunyu, in addition to staying in the factory, his hometown of Weifang had a soda factory where he could be useful, and his family could change their household registration from agricultural to non-agricultural.

The 26-year-old young man from Jinan, Wang Taoqian, had a girlfriend in his hometown, and it would be reasonable to return there after being transferred.

There were also Xiao Gongwen from Sichuan Nanchong and Li Zuhong from Luzhou. How could they not know that Qianjiang Region was the poorest in the province, and Yuyang County was the poorest in that region?

At the end of 1985, these five young Communist Party members finally made their choice.

When Wang Taoqian heard that he was going to a small county in the deep mountains of Sichuan, his girlfriend refused to agree, and after failing to persuade her, they had to break up. But at the last moment, the girl still asked Wang for "compensation for lost youth" of 1,000 yuan. The young man was heartbroken and threw himself into the work of establishing the pharmaceutical factory, working hard to distract himself from his sorrow.

Huang Dianyu, the 38-year-old man who carried the burden of being the factory director, experienced the pain of choice even more deeply. At the beginning of the business, he found that many of the county's policies to attract talent had suddenly disappeared. There was no salary, family members' household registration could not be transferred, and they had to buy market grain with their own transfer fees. Unable to afford firewood, family members went up the mountain to cut thatch, and sometimes the family had noodles for three meals a day...

All these hardships were endured, but the emotional pain tore at his heart. In July 1987, his father fell seriously ill, but his son, who studied medicine, was busy establishing the pharmaceutical factory. When he returned to his hometown of Shangluo in Shaanxi, his father had already been buried for three days.

Speaking of the hardships of starting a business, Li Chunyu was also very moved: "At that time, we were working like madmen. Take Xiao Gongwen, for example. During the construction of the factory, he was injured and escaped from the hospital with one arm in a sling to continue welding. Why? We just wanted the world to see: coming to the mountains is to help the poor, not to get rich."

Last March 8, the Wuling Mountain Pharmaceutical Factory officially started production. This entity, which carries the deep love of five Communist Party members for the people of the impoverished region and embodies their pursuit of their career, created a production value of 19.9 million yuan in just half a year. The main product, artemisinin, is a globally recognized effective drug for treating malaria. Wuling Mountain Pharmaceutical Factory is now the only designated factory in the country. When wild artemisia becomes a precious medicinal material, who can measure how much joy it brings to the thousands of impoverished households in Yuyang! To say nothing else, just from selling artemisia to the factory, local farmers have earned 20 million yuan...

The endless Wuling Mountains stretch beneath, and the road extends underfoot.

### 武陵山下的追求

　　武陵山下的追求
    本报记者  陈华
    饭铺前，一位卖药老人问一位正在吃面的军人：“解放军同志，你的面好多钱一碗？今天卖药没落几个钱，看能不能吃上碗面。”
    军人给老人代买了两碗面，老人跪下了。
    ……
    黄殿宇一想起三年前途经彭水县城所经历的这一幕，心情就不能平静。那时，他还是北京总后勤部长城制药厂的一位车间主任。时值转业之际，得知远处四川东南角的酉阳土家族苗族自治县领导来京恳请智力扶贫，他和几位志同道合的战友合计好了，利用酉阳的药材优势办一家制药厂，给当地的老百姓栽棵摇钱树。
    消息传出后，有些人不理解：“去深圳是淘金，去深山是唱高调。”作出选择前，五位伙伴就料到这样那样的议论，也没往心里去。没料到的是，真到了拿决定的节骨眼上，发现最难战胜的倒是自我！
    黄殿宇，摆在他面前的路很多，作为一名军队技术干部，转业后留在长城制药厂干点事业似乎顺理成章。“去深山？”有不少的人劝他别冒傻气。
    李春玉，除了留在厂里，家乡潍坊有个碱厂，回到那儿有用武之地，家属也可以农转非。
    ２６岁的济南小伙子王套先，对象在家乡，转业回去更在情理之中。
    还有来自四川南充的肖功文、泸州的李祖荣，他俩何尝不知道黔江地区是省里最贫困的地区，而酉阳县又是这一地区最穷困的县。
    １９８５年底，这５位年轻共产党员终于作出了他们的抉择。
    听说王套先要去四川一个深山里的小县，他的对象怎么也不同意，劝说无效，只好分手。可临到最后，姑娘还向小王索要了“青春补偿费”１０００元。小伙子很伤心，便一头扎进制药厂的筹建工作，拚命干活排遣心中的苦闷。
    黄殿宇，这位肩负着厂长担子的３８岁的汉子，体味到的选择的痛苦更是绵绵不断。创业之初，他就感到县里好些吸引人才的政策条件不知一下子跑哪儿去了，工资没处开，家属户口上不了，吃饭得用自己的转业费去买市场粮。买不起柴禾，家属就上山割茅草，有时家里一天三餐全是面条……
    这些都挺过来了，可情感上的苦痛却撕碎了他的心。１９８７年７月，父亲病重，可学医的儿子正忙着筹建制药厂，等他回到陕西商洛老家，父亲已入土三天。
    说起创业的艰辛，李春玉也很激动：“那时真是玩命的干，就拿肖功文来说，在建厂的时候他受了伤，吊着一只胳膊从医院逃出来还在电焊。图个啥？我们只想让世人看看：来深山是扶贫还是发财。”
    去年３月８日，武陵山制药厂正式投产。这个承载着五位共产党员对贫困地区人民深厚的爱，凝结着他们事业追求的实体，仅半年时间就创产值１９９万元。主产品青蒿素是世界公认的治疗疟疾的有效药物，武陵山制药厂现在是国内唯一的定点厂家。当漫山遍野的青蒿从野草变为珍贵药物的原料，又有谁能估量它为酉阳千百家贫困的农户带来了多少喜悦！别的不说，仅割青蒿卖给厂里一项，当地农民就收入２００万元……
    绵延的武陵山下，路在脚下延伸。
