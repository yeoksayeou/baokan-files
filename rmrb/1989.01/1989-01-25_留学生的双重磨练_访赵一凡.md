The Dual Challenges of Overseas Students

An Interview with Zhao Yifan

Qian Ning

Zhao: I call it an academic reorientation. The knowledge we acquire abroad is mostly foreign and new, so upon returning, it needs to be adapted or combined with the domestic situation. The gap between our academic circles and the outside world is so vast that I can't directly translate and publish my "foreign eight-legged essays" completed at Harvard—from format, propositions, methods to academic language, none of it matches. So, I first wrote "Notes on Reading at Harvard," which was actually sketching the contemporary part of my "American Cultural and Intellectual History." But this also became a topic of discussion: Why doesn't Zhao Yifan write academic papers but essays? Do these notes count as academic achievements? So, I had to start writing "standard academic papers" to qualify for a senior title and gain the right to independent research. I luckily passed this hurdle, thanks to the support of my institute and academic seniors.

Reporter: It seems you have now entered the third stage?

Zhao: Yes. This third stage is about "catching up with the trends and seeking development." I'm not very confident about this. On one hand, after being back for over two years, I'm increasingly worried about falling behind academically. The topics discussed in my Harvard research class have become unfamiliar to me; new books reviewed in foreign academic journals make me anxious. However, compared to my peers in natural sciences, I, a slowpoke in the humanities, am quite fortunate. A PhD from MIT returned and stayed idle for three years; by the time he went back, he probably had nothing to say to his teachers. Overseas students hope to have the opportunity to go abroad periodically after returning, to grab topics and materials and work hard back home. I've set a few topics related to contemporary Western literature and cultural theory for myself, but I can't guarantee how or when they will be completed. But I'm not content and don't plan to give up easily. I want to compete with my American peers over the next ten years. This might be a foolish idea, but isn't the significance of overseas students in this?

Reporter: Starting from the first generation of overseas students, Yuan Conghuan, China has sent overseas students for over a hundred years, spanning five or six generations. Each generation has made tremendous contributions to national rejuvenation and the country's strength. Perhaps the most brilliant achievements in the cultural sphere belong to the generation of Lu Xun and Hu Shi. Today, as reforms deepen, China's cultural and intellectual circles are also undergoing tremendous changes. At this crucial historical juncture, this generation of overseas students should have a lot to do.

Zhao: Yes. But the current situation is quite different from the May Fourth era. At that time, the cultural remnants of the Qing Dynasty were already rotten and could not withstand a blow, which is why Hu Shi and others achieved success at a young age and were full of vigor. Today's China needs gradual and steady reforms. The task of updating and replacing in the academic and intellectual fields is indeed urgent, but the continuation of tradition and the transformation of mechanisms also require careful and long-term arrangements and considerations. In this period, the significance of overseas students returning is at least theoretically valid: just look at the gap between the 40 to 50-year-old age group. The problem lies in the understanding and cooperation between overseas students and the government.

Reporter: Setting aside specific problems, what is your overall evaluation of this generation of overseas students?

Zhao: I have been a leader of the Harvard Chinese Students Association and the Boston Chinese Students Federation. Based on personal experience, this generation of overseas students is talented and accomplished, and their hearts are still warm. What emotion can compare with the longing of Chinese overseas students for their motherland? When I left Harvard, there were already 150 Chinese PhD students on campus, now nearly 200. The Greater Boston area has over a thousand. The oldest among them are "old students" from before the Cultural Revolution, the middle layer includes people like me who are "sent-down youth," and below them is a large group of Chinese "prodigies" in their 20s. Their achievements and prospects are indeed a source of pride for our country. Among them, the emergence of world-class scholars and experts is just a matter of time. This is not an empty promise. Because the Nobel laureates and members of the American Academy of Sciences in the Boston area alone number over a hundred. Studying under such mentors, how can one not achieve results? They will definitely contribute to the motherland in the future, though I can't say exactly how each person will do it, but I am deeply convinced of this. I am steadfast in my chosen path. Here, I would like to use this space to extend New Year's greetings to the tens of thousands of students studying in the United States, wishing them great progress in their studies and to never forget their motherland.

### 留学生的双重磨练——访赵一凡

　　留学生的双重磨练
    ——访赵一凡
    钱宁
    赵：我称之为学术方向上的重新调整。因为在国外学的知识多半是洋的、新的，回来需要依据国内现状加以改造或结合。我们学术界同外面的差异之大，使我无法直接翻译发表在哈佛完成的“洋八股”——从体例、命题、方法到学术语言都不相吻合。于是先写《哈佛读书札记》，其实是在为我的《美国文化思想史》勾勒当代部分。可这也成为议论的话题：为什么赵一凡不写论文写杂文？这类札记算不算学术成果呢？于是我只好写起“正规学术论文”来，为的是评高级职称，取得独立研究的资格。这一关我侥幸过来，也多亏所里和学术界前辈的关照。
    记者：看来你目前已步入第三阶段了？
    赵：不错。这第三阶段是所谓“追赶潮流，以图发展”。我现在对此把握不大。一方面因为回国两年多，日益忧虑自己在学术上的落后。哈佛研究班上讨论的课题对我来说已变得陌生；国外学术刊物上评论的新书又让我心惊。不过，比起自然科学的同学，我这种文科笨伯还算是有福气的。麻省理工学院的博士回来窝了三年，再回去时，大概就会无言以对老师了。留学生回国后希望仍能有机会定期出去，抓了题目和材料回来苦干。我给自己定了几个有关西方当代文学与文化理论的题目，至于如何完成、何时完成就不敢保证了。但我心里不服气，也不打算过早认输。我想在今后十年里同美国的同学比上几轮。这也许是痴话，然而作为留学生的意义不正在于此吗？
    记者：从第一代留学生容闳算起，中国派留学生已逾百年，多达五六代人。每一代都为民族振兴和祖国强盛作出了巨大贡献。在文化界业绩最为辉煌的也许要推鲁迅、胡适那一代。今天，随着改革深入，中国文化思想界也正发生巨变。如此重要的历史关头，这一代留学生似应大有作为呀。
    赵：是啊。可现今情况与五·四时期大不一样。那时前清遗老文化已经腐朽之至，不堪一击，这才有胡适等人少年得志，气吞长虹。如今的中国更需要渐进稳重的变革发展。学术思想领域里更新换代任务固然紧迫，可传统的延续、机制的转型也需要慎重长远的安排和考虑。在这一时期，留学生回归的意义至少在理论上是成立的：看看４０岁到５０岁年龄层之间的断裂就明白了。问题在于留学生和政府双方的理解配合。
    记者：撇开具体问题不谈，你对这一代留学生的整体评价如何？
    赵：我做过哈佛中国同学会和波士顿中国学联的负责人。据个人感觉，这一代留学生是英才济济，学有所成，而且他们的血还是热的。天下有什么感情能与中国留学生眷念祖国之情相比呢？我离开哈佛时，在校中国博士生已达１５０人，如今近２００人。大波士顿地区有上千人。其中最年长者是“文革”前的老大学生，中间一层是我这样的“知青”，下面就是一大批２０多岁的中国“神童”。他们成绩之好，前途之大，确实使人为祖国感到骄傲。在他们中间出现世界一流的学者专家只是时间问题。这不是空话。因为波士顿地区的诺贝尔奖得主和美国科学院院士就多达百人。跟着这样的导师学习能不出成果吗？他们将来一定会报效祖国，至于每个人以何种方式，我说不准，但对此深信不疑。我对自己选择的道路，矢志不移。这里愿借贵报一角，特向留美数万名同学致以春节的问候，祝学业大进，毋忘祖国。
