The national elite sanda tournament opened today in Tianjin. Many armed police officers on the stands learned defensive fighting skills from the intense competition.

Nearly 100 athletes from military and local sanda teams participated in this competition. They all fought bravely and tenaciously. The first pair of 52-kilogram-level athletes who stepped onto the ring in the evening, Guo Zhiye from the Dalian Zhonghua Commercial House Sanda Team wearing a black sanda uniform and Zhao Hongwei from the Henan Team wearing a red uniform, engaged in a fierce battle. They grappled, kicked, and wrestled, with neither giving an inch. Sometimes they were in close combat, sometimes using fists and legs, attacking and defending in a stalemate. Guo Zhiye ultimately lost a bit of an advantage due to lack of experience. Coach Qiu Guoyou of the Dalian Team said that both fighters displayed martial arts style and characteristics, showing great potential. This competition saw many new participants, indicating that sanda teams are growing, and more people are becoming fond of this sport.

There were several other pairs of athletes who fought as intensely as the 52-kilogram-level pair. The athletes from Tsinghua University and Henan teams showed exceptional skills, with clear strategies and rhythm.

The Henan and Hebei Cangzhou teams also demonstrated many traditional martial arts techniques, such as ground rolling punches and spinning kicks.

The competition helped many spectators understand the essence of sanda, which is beneficial for building courage, enhancing physical fitness, and self-defense.

　　全国散打精英赛揭幕
    近百高手角逐津门
    本报天津一月七日电  记者黄振中报道：全国防卫技击武术散打精英赛今天在天津揭幕。看台上的众多武警战士从激烈的角逐中学习到防卫搏击本领。
    参加这次比赛的有来自军队和地方散打队的近百名选手，他们都打得十分勇猛顽强。晚上走上擂台的第一对五十二公斤级选手，穿黑色散打服的大连中花商行武术散打队郭治业和穿红色服的河南队赵洪伟你打我摔，你踢我抱，不可开交。时而短兵相接，时而拳腿并用，一攻一防不相上下。郭治业最后因经验不足才让对方稍占上风。大连队主教练邱国友说，两人都打出了武术风格和特点，很有希望。这次参赛新手多，说明散打队在壮大，喜爱这项运动的人越来越多。
    像五十二公斤级这样精彩的较量，还有好几对，清华大学队和河南队选手身手不凡，有章法，有节奏。
    河南和河北沧州队还打出了许多武术传统功夫，如地趟拳、转身揣腿等。
    比赛使不少观众了解到散打的内涵，对提高勇气，增强体质及防身擒敌都有好处。
