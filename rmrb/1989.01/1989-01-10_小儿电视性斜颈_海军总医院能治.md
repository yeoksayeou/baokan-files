A child named Lu Hao would always tilt his head to one side, lift his chin, and look at the television with a twisted neck and squinting eyes. His parents took him to the Navy General Hospital for treatment. The child's vision in both eyes had dropped to 0.5. The diagnosis was TV-induced torticollis. After one week of treatment by the hospital's doctors, Lu Hao's vision in both eyes recovered to 0.9 and 1.0.

TV-induced torticollis is a new eye disease that even some ophthalmologists are unaware of. This condition is common in children and often presents with symptoms such as decreased vision, refractive errors, strabismus, amblyopia, and congenital nystagmus. It is an abnormal condition that occurs during the developmental stage of a child's visual function and requires early detection and correction; otherwise, it may result in permanent disability.

The Navy General Hospital, located in the Ganjiapu area of Beijing, has established the country's first specialized clinic for the treatment of TV-induced torticollis. The clinic is led by Yan Shaoming, the deputy chief of the ophthalmology department, along with six other ophthalmologists. Treatment for this condition generally does not require hospitalization or surgery. Most children only need to undergo eye correction and visual function training in the outpatient department. Since last October, over 60 patients have been treated, with most children showing corrected posture and an effectiveness rate of over 80%.

　　小儿电视性斜颈
    海军总医院能治
    本报讯  一名叫陆浩的小孩在看电视的时候，总是把头歪向一侧，下巴上抬，偏着脖子，斜着两眼看电视。其父母带小浩到海军总医院就医，孩子两眼的视力都下降到０．５，诊断为电视性斜颈。经总医院医生矫治一周后，陆浩两眼视力恢复为０．９、１．０。
    电视性斜颈是一种新的眼病，包括一些眼科医生都不知道这种病。此病多发于儿童，常有视力下降、屈光不正、斜视、弱视及先天性眼球震颤等症状，是儿童在发育阶段视功能发育失调出现的异常病态，需要及早检查矫治，否则可能留下永久性的残疾。
    地处北京市甘家口地区的海军总医院的眼科副主任颜少明和６名眼科医师，开办了全国第一家治疗电视性斜颈的专病门诊。治疗此病一般不要住院和手术，绝大多数儿童只需在门诊进行眼睛矫治和视功能训练。从去年１０月询诊以来，６０多例患者治疗表明，大部分儿童姿势得到纠正，有效率在８０％以上。
