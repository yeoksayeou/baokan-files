Some people say that the current cultural landscape is entering a low tide, indicating that the social demand for academic culture and high-level literature and art is gradually declining. The accumulation of culture is obviously declining, to the extent that it seems to be on the verge of interruption. The cultural traditions that have continued through the long river of history have been repeatedly impacted and are becoming increasingly diluted.

Take literature and art as an example. What fills the market is the increasingly inflated entertainment culture and leisure culture, in a word, it is mostly recreational culture.

You only need to walk into a bookstore or bookstand, the colorful displays, and the best-selling books are mostly of this kind. The editorial departments of publishers often shelve manuscripts of academic works, and the manuscripts in circulation are mostly recreational works. As for other art fields, such as music, popular songs have replaced classical masterpieces; traditional plays, Beijing opera, and other drama genres are mostly in decline; certain genres in folk arts are on the brink of extinction, and so on. In short, the decline of culture is continuing.

Naturally, this situation has caused widespread concern among the enlightened, but ultimately, because it is beyond remedy, this concern is only a helpless sigh. Of course, there are also many people who think that it can be "guided by the trend," thus proposing various schemes to change the status quo and prescribing various remedies to reverse the decline. However, since they have not been tested, it is not yet known whether they are truly effective. As for the causes of the low trough, opinions often vary. The most common view is that social supervision is weak, especially the improper and out-of-control measures of administrative forces, which have led to this situation. This view seems plausible, but the causes of a cultural phenomenon are only superficial. The deeper factors must be sought in the changes of social psychology, especially in the mindset of the broadest cultural consumers, the youth. Some people see the social mentality expressed in the currently popular song "One and Nothing" as the most direct reflection of the social trend, believing that this is the broadest social psychological background for the current trend of cultural decline. It has "a very complex emotion," with "sorrow, despair, sadness, but not willing to sink," "One and Nothing" is not just about the lack of material and money, but more importantly, it is about the low status, the deprivation of participation rights, the suppression of life vitality, and the resulting confusion, loss, repression, yearning, bewilderment, and sense of disillusionment. Its philosophical implication is 'the meaninglessness of existence,' 'the meaninglessness of life,' 'no crisis is as fundamental as this crisis' (see Zhou Yan's article in the December 1988 issue of "Reading"). It seems that this analysis touches the deeper aspects of the issue. If there is any supplement, I think that this confused and lost mentality is both real and transitional and short-lived. The future development lies in the continuous changes of real life. It is hard to imagine that a social mentality will long stagnate in the state of "One and Nothing." That wandering psychology is only a unique spiritual phenomenon produced when social psychology reaches a certain peak.

It is understandable that the inner layer of this wandering psychology is pain, despair, and sadness, which leads to the loss of clear rational pursuit and life pursuit. Reflected in cultural consciousness, it is the emptiness of having no demands at all. "The theory of the uselessness of reading" is a cultural phenomenon, seeking stimulation in life is another cultural phenomenon. The spiritual orientation of society has shown a sense of numbness and despair, except for stimulating the nerves, nothing else is of interest. Reality is seen as an illusion, and the future is unknown. Thus, those purely recreational and stimulating literary works are born, filling a spiritual void in this social stratum, just as using the bait of money to fill the needs of all those who seek profit. It seems that this state will continue, although it is short-lived, getting out of the low trough is not something that can be achieved in a short time.

As a social historical phenomenon, it seems unnecessary to be surprised, let alone pessimistic. The view that the cultural low trough is an inevitable historical trend may not stand up to scrutiny. Whether a society that transitions from a natural economy to a commodity economy will definitely experience a cultural low trough as a historical necessity, from the past social historical development, there seems to be no such regular phenomenon. Of course, economic phenomena and cultural phenomena are both related and have their own unique development laws. Today's cultural low trough phenomenon is a unique chaotic phenomenon that occurs in a period of social life stagnation and a certain turning point. This culture that is neither edible nor wearable is pushed to a very secondary position by the social selection mechanism. Society demands economic productivity from its members, not cultural productivity. The severe decoupling of economy and culture makes culture in a state of self-regulation and spontaneity. This spontaneous state is inevitably chaotic. If this chaos is seen as an inevitable phenomenon, it will help to explain the cultural low trough phenomenon best.

In the literary field, the current decline is not a trend towards extinction but towards a period of dormancy. Pure literature or serious literature, though facing a crisis at present, still has a solid internal potential. A large number of writers who are determined to explore new paths of creation are still emerging, seeking artistic forms suitable for changing life; another group of scholars who are dedicated to researching new theoretical knowledge are also diligently exploring new propositions in theoretical thinking. Their hard work, though not forming a vast expanse at present, must be seen as the true spiritual pillar of literature's ascent to the peak. This spiritual pillar stands firmly and tenaciously in the wind and rain of the low trough, just as living organisms will not disappear due to the cold under the heavy snow of a winter nap, they are waiting for spring.

We cannot regard the lament of "One and Nothing" as the main tune of the whole society. Society is a changing and complex whole, and its dynamic mechanism often makes a certain main tune become secondary or even unimportant, and then a new main tune rises. The end of the decade of turmoil has caused people's extreme spiritual excitement, and the prosperous period in culture symbolizes this. However, any excitement that reaches its extreme without decline does not exist. From high to low, and from low to a new high, this has always been the masterstroke of the old man of history. It is not unreasonable to say that the "One and Nothing" style of wandering cannot wander forever, so it is not the end. The end is a new change. With the rise of the economy, social changes will inevitably bring about complex changes in social consciousness and social mentality, especially to see that as the backbone of society, the youth will not stay in a state of wandering. Their temporary confusion and bewilderment prove that they are only seeking the path they want to take, in other words, they are seeking their true position. It can be imagined that in a society of survival and development and full of profit-seeking consciousness, change is unstoppable. People drive the gears of society, and society creates different destinies for people at every moment. In that process of constant crowding and collision, will there not be a new change in social mentality?

In the vast universe, people strive to grasp their own destiny, making new pursuits and new expressions. Time will prove that the enlightenment given by the impact of reality is their spiritual anchor, which will return to the appeal of culture, and the existing large amount of "low trough" culture is far from satisfying their thirst. They must make new choices. Only the culture that shines with conscience is what people truly pursue, and only this pursuit related to the destiny of the nation can make people's wandering mentality truly balanced. Its days of shining brilliance will be its unshakable future, and its first flashpoint of brilliance is often in literature.

Hegel said, "What is real is not necessarily reasonable, but what is reasonable is real." History will once again prove the truth of this statement.

　　“文化低谷”透视
    洁泯
    有人说，如今的文化格局正在进入一个低潮，这低潮所告知的是学术文化以及高层次的文学艺术的社会需求日渐低落，文化积累的明显衰退以至预示着有中断之虞，延绵于历史长河中的文化传统经过一再的冲击而日见其淡化。
    以文学艺术为例，充斥市场的是日见其膨胀的娱乐性文化，休息性文化，一言以蔽之，大抵是消闲文化而已。
    你只要走进书店书摊，那摆设得五光十色的，而且是最为畅销的，大都是这类书。出版社的编辑部，学术著作的稿件辄束之高阁，运转中的书稿多属消闲之作。至于在别的文艺领域，例如音乐，流行歌曲替代了古典名曲；舞台上传统的话剧、京剧和其他剧种，大多宣告着不景气；曲艺中某些品种正濒临着没顶之厄，如此等等。总之，文化的滑坡正在继续。
    不消说，这情形引起了有识之士的普遍忧虑，但终于因回天无术，这忧虑也只是无可奈何的怅惘罢了。自然，也颇有人认为可以“因势利导”的，于是设想出若干改变现状的方案，开出种种挽回颓势的药方，但因为未经实验，是否真有效益尚未可知。至于造成低谷的根由，往往众说不一，最常见的说法是社会监督的不力，尤其是行政力量的措置不当以至失控，以致弄成这局面。这说法似可以成立，但一种文化现象的造成，行政力量的是否有效只是一个表层的原因，深层的因素必须从社会心理的变异中去寻找，特别是从最广大的文化消费者青年的心态中去求得答案。有人把当前流行歌曲《一无所有》所表达的社会心态看作是社会思潮的最直接的反映，认定这是文化趋于低谷的当前最为广阔的社会心理背景。它具有“一种极为复杂的情感”，“有悲怆、失望、伤感而不甘沉沦”，“《一无所有》不仅仅是指物质、金钱的匮乏，更主要是地位的低下，参与权的被剥夺，生命活力的被钳制，以及由此导致的迷茫、失落、压抑、怅惘、困惑和幻灭感”，“它的哲学意蕴是‘存在的无意义’，‘人生的无意义’”，“哪一种危机都没有这种危机来得更带有根本性”（见《读书》１９８８年１２月号周彦一文）。看来这一分析触着了事情的深层面。倘有补充，那末我认为，这种迷茫、失落的心态既是现实的，但又是过渡的，短暂的，那前景的发展是什么，将发生于现实生活不断变化中间。很难想象一种社会心态会长远停滞在“一无所有”的状态上，那种怅惘的徘徊心理，不过是社会心理发展到某一顶点时所产生的特有的精神现象。
    可以理解的是，那徘徊心理的内层是痛苦、失望和伤感，由此丧失了清醒的理性追求和人生追求，反映于文化意识上，则是没有任何需求的那种空白而已。“读书无用论”是一种文化现象，寻求生活的刺激是又一种文化现象，社会的精神趋向出现了一种麻木感与破灭感，除了刺激神经，什么都不感到兴趣，把现实视作为梦幻，对前途茫无所知。于是那些纯属消闲和具有刺激性的文艺读物就应运而生，算是填补了这一社会层的一项精神空白，就像用金钱的诱饵去填补着一切逐利者的需求一样。看来这一状态还要持续下去，虽说是短暂的，但走出低谷也并不是很短时间内可以奏效的。
    作为一种社会历史现象，似乎不必因此惊讶，自然更不必悲观。那种对文化低谷认定是难以改变的历史趋势的见解，未必站得住脚。一个从自然经济走向商品经济的社会结构，在文化上是否一定会出现一个文化低谷的历史必然，从以往的社会历史发展的状况考察，似乎并无此种规律现象可找。自然，经济现象和文化现象是既有联系又各有自身特殊的发展规律，今天的文化低谷现象，是在社会生活趋于困顿和某一转折期所发生的特有的混乱现象。这既不能吃又不能穿的文化，被社会的选择机制排挤于一种十分次要的位置上，社会向社会成员索取的是经济的生产力而暂且不是文化的生产力。经济与文化的严重脱节，使文化处于一种自我调节的自发状态中，这自发状态不免是混乱，倘把这混乱看作是不可避免的现象，那将有助于对文化低谷现象作出最好的解释。
    从文学领域来说，当前的那种低落不是趋向消亡，是趋向于一种沉潜期。纯文学或严肃文学在现时虽濒临着危机，但是它蓄积着的内在的潜在力量却仍是牢固地存在。一大批矢志于开拓创作新途的作家，仍在层出不穷地寻找适合于变革中的生活的艺术方式；另一批潜心于攻研理论新知的学者，也依然孜孜不倦地挖掘理论思维中的新命题。他们的辛勤耕作，如今虽不能形成一个大面积的天地，但必须看到这才是文学攀登高峰的真正的精神支柱。这一精神支柱在低谷的风雨中站立着，默默地顽强地站立着，正如在漫天大雪覆盖下的冬眠中的生物不会因寒冷而消失一样，它们在期待着春天。
    不能把“一无所有”的咏叹看作是全社会的主调，社会是个变化着的复杂的整体，它的变动机制常常使某种主调降为次要的以至处于不重要的位置上，然后上升起新的主调。十年动乱的灾难结束，引起了人们极度的精神亢奋，文化上的旺盛期就标志着这一点。然而任何亢奋臻于极致而不衰的状态是不存在的，从高涨到低落，由低落而出现新的高涨，从来就是历史老人的得意手笔。不妨断言，那种“一无所有”式的徘徊是不可能一直徘徊下去的，因此它不是结局。结局是一种新的变化，随着经济上升的社会变革，由此必然是相应发生着复杂的社会意识和社会心态的变异，尤其要看到，作为社会中坚的青年，他们终究是不会停留于徘徊状态的，他们一时的迷茫、困惑，证明着他们不过是在寻求自己要走的路，换句话说，他们在寻求自身真正的位置。可以设想，在一种求生存求发展和充斥着逐利意识的社会现实中，变化无时停息，人推动着社会的齿轮，社会又在每一瞬间制造着人的各个不同的命运，就在那种不断拥挤、不断撞击的历程中，难道将不会出现社会心态的新变化吗？
    茫茫世宇中的人们，为了把握自己的命运，都不息地在作新的追求，作出自己新的表现。时间将会证明，现实的撞击给予他们的感悟，是他们的精神寄托仍将回归到求诉于文化，而现存的大量的“低谷”文化远远不能满足他们的渴求，他们必须作新的选择。只有闪耀着良知的文化才是人们所要真正追求的，也只有这种关系到民族命运的精神因素的追求，才足以使人们徘徊状态的心态取得真正的平衡。它的辉耀闪烁的日子将是它确定不移的前途，而它的首先闪光的爆破点又常常是在文学。
    黑格尔说过，“现实的不都是合理的，合理的则是现实的”。历史将再度证实这句名言的真理性。
