In recent years, many patriotic intellectuals across the country have sighed heavily and bitterly over the harsh reality of "the iron rice bowl breeding idlers." Now, after a few years, many enterprise leaders across the country are still worried about the lack of enthusiasm among their employees. However, during my visit to the Capital Steel and Iron Corporation, I felt that among the vast workforce (including the 60,000 employees recently merged into Shougang), those who could be called "idlers" were already quite rare. The leaders of Shougang proudly told me: "Now, loyalty to duty and strict adherence to regulations have become the conscious actions of the majority of employees. No matter what task is contracted, it can be completed on time and to standard without any reduction. This is because the contract system integrates the country's prosperity, the enterprise's development, and the employees' personal pursuit of a happy life into one, creating a virtuous cycle of 'everyone contributes more, the country collects more, the enterprise retains more, and individuals earn more,' uniting all employees into a collective striving for progress..."

A drop of water can reflect the brilliance of the sun. This article, through the transformation of a Shougang worker, reflects from another angle the tremendous power of Shougang's contract system.

I am Ba Yunxiao, 36 years old, and the foreman of the L shift at the small rolling mill. In September 1971, at the age of 19, I came to Shougang from the North Anhe Brigade in Haidian District. I was incredibly happy at the time! Who would have thought that as a rolling mill worker, the work would be so complex and labor-intensive, and I always felt restricted and uncomfortable. Plus, whether I worked hard or not, I still only got 41.54 yuan a month. So, out of the more than 50 people who came with me, 30 returned to the countryside. Every month when I received my salary, I would grumble to myself: should I continue being a worker or go back to being a farmer? In the end, the thought of "waiting and seeing" kept me temporarily at Shougang.

In 1979, my wife's production team implemented the responsibility system with remuneration linked to output. That year, she received over 400 yuan. She was quite proud and said to me, "Your company is so big, and you've been getting 41.54 yuan for so many years! If you keep this up, you can ask to come back, and I'll support you!" How could a man let his wife support him? Fortunately, that year Shougang started its reforms and gave me a raise. So, I decided to wait and see.

Just as I was feeling depressed and lazy, guarding modern equipment without any spirit, the contract system implemented in 1981 saved me from my gloom and laziness. Of course, at the beginning, I didn't truly understand the significance of the contract system. I only knew that the more you work, the more you earn, and if you don't work well, you get deducted (bonus). I started to overcome the mentality of "relaxing on the job, working slowly, eating from the big pot, and being a big soldier." Later, as the contract system was continuously improved, strengthened, and combined with a series of ideological education and style training, I realized that Shougang's contract system is good because it handles the interests of the country, the enterprise, and the individual well, and everything is known a year in advance. At this point, I genuinely acknowledged that we workers are not only laborers but also owners of the enterprise and sharers of the fruits of labor; we are contributing to the country while striving for our own better lives. This made me feel an urgent need to improve my ideological and political qualities and cultural and technical skills, and I firmly resolved to become an outstanding rolling mill worker.

When I entered the factory, I had only completed one year of junior high school. In 1982, I obtained a supplementary qualification certificate for junior high school Chinese and mathematics through self-study at the factory. At the end of 1983, our factory introduced advanced cutting and rolling technology from Canada. During the three to four months of trial rolling, I only rested for two or three days, eating and living in the factory, completely losing track of when to start and end work. Seeing me work so hard, the factory leaders sent me home by special car and forced me to rest, but I couldn't rest easy, and the next day I returned to the factory with a weak body. Through our hard work, the cutting and rolling technology reached the design level in four months. From then on, I decided to master all the knowledge related to rolling. So, I bought dozens of technical books about rolling, and after work, I would read them while taking care of my children. In the evening, after everyone in the family had gone to sleep, I would write summaries and take notes based on the books and our actual work. In April 1984, after studying the rolling die system, I proposed a plan to modify the die to the technical department, addressing the issue of red steel not entering the cutting and rolling machine about 10 times a day. This modification basically eliminated the problem. Over the years, I have proposed more than 30 suggestions for innovation and improvement, contributing to production development.

In recent years, Shougang has had many new projects put into production. Some key personnel from our factory were sent to support the new plants, and the new employees had difficulty adapting technically. As an old rolling mill worker, I felt responsible for passing on the experience and lessons of cutting and rolling to them. So, I decided to write down my experiences participating in the installation, testing, improvement, and operation adjustment of the cutting and rolling machine. Over the years, I have hardly had the time to watch TV quietly, and the family has never gone into the city to play. It can be said that writing has become my second job. So far, I have written over 860,000 words of rolling cutting technology materials and summarized and compiled them into a 200,000-word book titled "Questions and Answers on Small Continuous Rolling Machine Rolling Technology." I plan to finish the third volume by the end of the year.

The enterprise contract system created by Shougang has turned me, a former peasant, into the master of modern large-scale production. Politically, in September 1986, I was proudly admitted to the Communist Party of China; technically, I am now a 9th-level rolling mill worker; economically, my monthly income has increased from 41.54 yuan to the current 330 yuan, and my home has changed from "a pile of firewood in the courtyard and four empty corners in the house." Ten years of reform have made me deeply realize that the contract system is not only a path of reform that suits the national conditions but also a great furnace for nurturing and forging people.

At Shougang, it is not just Ba Yunxiao who has changed. His transformation can be said to be a microcosm of the changes in the Shougang workforce.

　　承包制育新人
    ——一位首钢工人的自述
    本报记者  江世杰
    前些年，神州大地多少忧国忧民之士，曾为“大锅饭养懒汉”这一严酷现实，发出过沉重而酸楚的喟叹！如今几年过去了，全国许多企业领导人，仍然在为无精打采的职工太多而愁眉苦脸。然而，记者在首都钢铁公司采访时感到，这里庞大的职工队伍（包括新近并入首钢的６万名职工）中，可称之为“懒汉”的人已经十分少见。首钢领导人自豪地告诉我：“现在，忠于职守，严格执行规章制度，已成为广大职工的自觉行动，无论是什么任务，只要承包下去，都能够按照规定的时限、标准，不折不扣地完成，这是因为，承包制把国家的富强、企业的发展同职工个人对幸福生活的追求融为一体，‘大家多创、国家多收、企业多留、个人多得’的良性循环，把全体职工联结成一个奋发向上的集体……”
    一滴水能反射太阳的光辉。本文通过一个首钢工人的素质变化，从另一个侧面来反映首钢承包制的巨大威力。
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    我叫巴云孝，今年３６岁，是小型轧钢厂轧钢Ｌ班班长。１９７１年９月，我１９岁时从海淀区北安河大队来到首钢，当时心里别提有多高兴了！谁知当了轧钢工，工艺复杂、劳动紧张不说，总感到处处受限制，不自在，再加上干好干坏都是每月４１．５４元，所以我们一起来的５０多个人中，有３０人又回农村去了。以后每月领工资时，我心里就嘀咕一阵子：是继续当工人呢，还是回去当农民呢？最后，是“等等看”的思想，把我暂时留在了首钢。
    １９７９年，我爱人所在的生产队实行了联产计酬责任制，当年就分得了４００多元。真是财大气粗，她对我说：“你们这么大的公司，４１．５４元拿了这么多年！再这样你就要求回来，我养活你！”堂堂五尺男子汉让老婆养活，这怎么行呢！正巧这一年首钢开始改革，给我长了一级工资，因此，我还是想等等看。
    正当我思想上苦闷，行动上懈怠，守着现代化设备提不起精神来的时候，１９８１年开始实行的承包制，把我从忧郁、懒散中解救出来。当然，刚开始我并不真正理解承包制的意义，只知道多干多得，干不好挨扣（奖金），我开始克服“班上大松心，干活慢腾腾，吃着大锅饭，当个大头兵”的心理。后来，随着承包制的不断完善、强化和一系列的思想教育、作风锻炼，我认识到，我们首钢承包制好就好在国家、企业、个人三者利益处理得好，而且都是“一年早知道”。这时我打心眼里承认，我们工人既是劳动者，又是企业所有者，还是劳动成果的分享者；我们既是在为国家做贡献，又是在为自己的美好生活努力干。这样，我产生了要努力提高思想政治素质和文化技术素质的迫切要求，树立了争当优秀轧钢工人的坚定信念。
    我入厂时只上过一年初中。１９８２年我通过在厂自学，取得了初中语文、数学的补习合格证。１９８３年底，我厂从加拿大引进切分轧制先进技术，在试轧的三四个月内我只休息了两三天，整天吃在厂里、住在厂里，根本分不清上班下班。厂领导见我这么拚命干，用专车送我回家，强迫休息，可我放心不下，第二天又挺着虚弱的身子回厂上班。经过我们的艰苦努力，切分轧制４个月就达到了设计水平。从这时起，我决心要把有关轧钢的知识都学到手。于是，我买了几十本关于轧钢的技术书籍，下班回家边哄孩子边看书。晚上等家里人都睡觉后，再结合书上说的和我们实际做的写总结、作笔记。１９８４年４月，我学习轧钢孔型系统以后，针对我厂每天发生１０来次红钢不进切分轧机的故障，向技术科提出了修改孔型的设想。这一改，真的基本杜绝了故障。几年来，我提出革新、改进的建议３０多项，为发展生产贡献了力量。
    这几年，我们首钢有许多新项目陆续投产，我厂一些骨干被抽去支援新厂，新上岗的同志技术上一时难以适应。我感到作为一名老轧钢工，有责任把有关切分轧制的经验教训传给他们。于是，我决心把自己参加切分轧机安装、试验、改进和操作调整的体会写出来。几年来，我几乎没静心看过一次电视，全家没有进城玩过一回。可以说，写书成了我的第二职业。至今我已写出８６万多字的轧钢切分技术资料，并从中归纳整理成２０万字的《小型连轧机轧制技术问答》。我争取年底写完第三册。
    首钢创造的企业承包制，把我这样的昔日小农，造就成了现代化大生产的主人。政治上，１９８６年９月我光荣加入了中国共产党；技术上，我现在已是９级轧钢工；经济上，每月收入从４１．５４元增加到现在的３３０元，我的家也改变了“院里柴火垛，屋内四角空”的状况。１０年改革使我深深体会到：承包制不仅是符合国情的改革之路，而且也是培养造就人的巨大熔炉。
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    在首钢，不只是巴云孝一人在变。他的变化，可以说是首钢职工队伍变化的一个缩影。
