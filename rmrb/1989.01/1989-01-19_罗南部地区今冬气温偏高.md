Over the past week, the climate in southern Romania has been unusual, with sunny days and melting snow. Today, the highest temperature reached 18 degrees Celsius.

January is typically the coldest month in Romania, where cold air from the Arctic meets humid air from the Mediterranean, often resulting in heavy snowfall and strong winds across the country. However, this year, due to the influence of warmer air from the Atlantic, the average temperature is 10-14 degrees Celsius higher than it was in the 1960s.

According to meteorologists in Bucharest, the warmer temperatures in southern Romania are expected to persist in the near future. So far, the higher temperatures have not had a negative impact on winter crops.

　　罗南部地区今冬气温偏高
    新华社布加勒斯特１月１７日电  近一周以来，罗马尼亚南部地区气候反常，白天阳光灿烂，积雪消融，今天最高气温达到１８摄氏度。
    每年１月是罗马尼亚的严冬季节，由北极来的寒流同地中海的潮湿气流在这里会合，常常造成全国各地大雪纷飞、寒风劲吹。但今年由于受到大西洋较暖气流的影响，平均气温比６０年代高１０—１４摄氏度。
    据布加勒斯特气象员说，近期内罗南部气温偏高的情况不会有很大变化，偏高气温尚未对越冬作物产生不良影响。
