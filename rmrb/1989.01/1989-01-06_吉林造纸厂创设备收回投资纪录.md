A paper machine capable of producing 200 tons of newsprint daily recovered its entire purchase cost in just 205 days after being introduced and put into operation. This new record was set by Jilin Paper Mill in the just-concluded year.

Jilin Paper Mill is the largest newsprint producer in China. Its newsprint production capacity accounts for a quarter of the national total. The operation of this paper machine has nearly doubled the mill's newsprint production capacity and raised its technological level by a grade.

　　吉林造纸厂创设备收回投资纪录
    一台可日产新闻纸二百吨的纸机，引进投产后二百零五天就收回全部购置费用。这一新纪录是吉林造纸厂在刚刚结束的一年里创造的。
    吉林造纸厂是我国最大的新闻纸生产厂家，它的新闻纸生产能力已占到全国新闻纸生产能力的四分之一，这台纸机的投产使这个厂新闻纸的生产能力翻了近一番，技术水平也提高了一个档次。
