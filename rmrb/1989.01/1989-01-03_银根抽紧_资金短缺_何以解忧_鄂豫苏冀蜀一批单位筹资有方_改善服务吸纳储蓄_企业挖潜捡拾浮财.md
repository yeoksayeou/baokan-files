In the process of regulating the economic environment, appropriately tightening the money supply plays a positive role in curbing economic overheating and controlling inflation. However, an overly tight supply of funds will affect the normal development of industrial and agricultural production, particularly hindering the procurement of agricultural products and increasing effective industrial supply. Therefore, at present, it is necessary to advocate for fully tapping into financial potential to prevent the economy from experiencing an unnecessary major downturn. In the process of collecting funds, it is also important to adhere to policies, focus on supporting effective supply, and avoid using funds on long-term products, so as to control demand while ensuring flexibility and stability.

Recently, the tightening of the money supply over the past few months has put pressure on the procurement of agricultural products and the normal development of industrial production. Facing the severe situation of fund shortages, financial institutions and enterprises in Hubei, Henan, Jiangsu, Hebei, and Sichuan provinces have been working tirelessly to raise funds, aiming to control demand while achieving flexibility and stability.

Improving banking services and enhancing service quality to attract more deposits is an important measure to supplement fund sources. Recently, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of Huanggang County, Hubei Province, has introduced new savings options such as prize savings, interest-bearing savings, value-preserving savings, and salary payment services. By mid-November 1988, the bank had recovered 70 million yuan in currency, an increase of over 22 million yuan compared to the same period last year. In Henan Province's Huaxian County, the supply and demand of funds are highly contradictory. After investigation and analysis, the county found that individual business owners still held a large amount of cash that had not been deposited in the bank. Therefore, the county government organized relevant departments to encourage individual business owners to deposit more funds. Within just over 20 days, nearly a thousand individual business owners deposited 18 million yuan. One individual business owner, after being mobilized, voluntarily deposited 9.8 million yuan, which was intended for building a house and purchasing high-end furniture, into the bank. The Sichuan Province South Chung Canned Food Factory organized employees to participate in savings, with 98.8% of employees actively participating. The monthly savings amount exceeded two million yuan, a significant increase compared to the same period last year.

Opening up new sources and saving on expenditures are important measures to overcome fund shortages. To this end, some financial departments have actively helped enterprises tap into financial potential and accelerate fund turnover. The Industrial and Commercial Bank of Zhangbei County, Hebei Province, signed a "Liquid Fund Management Agreement" with county enterprises, specifically stipulating six indicators such as the turnover days of liquid funds and the upper limit of funds occupied by finished products. If enterprises complete the stipulated indicators, the bank will actively supply funds within the limit; otherwise, a penalty interest of 30% to 50% will be imposed. As a result, industrial enterprises in the entire county have tapped into a financial potential of 36.8 million yuan by clearing idle equipment and overstocked materials. Currently, 19 enterprises in the county's Economic Commission system have collectively tapped into and activated 210 million yuan in funds, significantly accelerating the turnover of liquid funds and improving the efficiency of fund use.

Many enterprises, instead of waiting and observing during the period of tight money supply, have taken the initiative to find ways to gather funds. The direct industrial enterprises under the Economic Commission of Guanyun County, Jiangsu Province, while widely mobilizing employees to invest in stocks, have also seriously addressed the clearance of backlogged products and materials, accelerating fund turnover. They have also adopted methods such as prepayment for supply and advance payment of funds to attract external funds for high-quality and scarce market products. At the same time, they have collected idle social funds to increase enterprise financial strength. By the end of 1988, within 40 days, they raised 128.2 million yuan, laying a solid foundation for production in the new year. In Hebei Province's Yongnian County, facing a fund gap of 557 million yuan, the county actively tapped into local potential. By the end of November 1988, it had recovered overdue loans totaling 733.2 million yuan and retrieved 42 million yuan in funds that were defrauded, owed externally, and stagnant, thereby raising a large amount of funds for the procurement of grain, cotton, and oil.

It is worth noting that in solving the problem of fund shortages, some regions, departments, and units have adopted improper methods. For example, some financial institutions have forcibly bundled lottery tickets when issuing enterprise wages, forcibly saved half of the wages, and imposed deposits, which has caused public discontent.

　　银根抽紧　资金短缺　何以解忧
    鄂豫苏冀蜀一批单位筹资有方
    改善服务吸纳储蓄　企业挖潜捡拾浮财
    编者按 在治理经济环境中，适当紧缩银根对于制止经济过热，遏制通货膨胀具有积极作用。但是，资金供应过于紧张会影响工、农业生产的正常发展，特别是对于农产品收购工作和增加工业有效供给不利。因此，当前应当提倡充分挖掘资金潜力，防止经济出现不应有的大滑坡。在敛集资金的工作中，还要注意掌握政策，重点扶持有效供给，而不要把钱用在那些长线产品上，以求在控制需求的同时，做到紧中有活，稳中有增。
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    本报综合讯　近几个月来出现的银根紧缩给农产品收购工作和工业生产的正常发展带来压力。面对资金紧缺的严峻形势，鄂、豫、苏、冀、蜀的一批县级金融机构和企业千方百计地筹措资金，以求在控制需求的同时，做到紧中求活，稳中有增。
    改进银行工作，提高服务质量，力争多吸纳存款，是补充资金来源的重要措施。湖北省黄冈县工商银行近来开办了有奖储蓄、贴水储蓄、保值储蓄和代发工资等新储蓄种类，到１９８８年１１月中旬止，回笼货币７０００万元，比上年同期增加２２００多万元。河南省滑县资金供求矛盾非常突出。经调查分析，该县发现个体户手中尚有大量现金未存入银行。为此这个县政府组织有关部门发动个体户多存款，仅２０多天就有近上千家个体户存款１８０万元。一位经营百货的个体户经过动员后，主动将放在家里准备盖房子和购置高档家具的现金９．８万元全部存入银行。四川省南充罐头厂组织职工参加储蓄，有９８．８％的职工踊跃参加；月储蓄额超两万元，比上年同期成倍增长。
    开源节流是克服资金短缺的重要措施。为此，一些金融部门积极帮助企业挖掘资金潜力，加快资金周转。河北省张北县工商银行与县企业签订了《流动资金管理协议书》，具体规定了流动资金周转天数、成品资金占用限额等６项指标。企业如完成规定的各项指标，银行则在限额内积极供应资金，否则给予３０％至５０％的罚息。这样一来，全县工业企业仅通过清理闲置设备和超储物资就挖掘资金潜力３６．８万元；目前，该县经委系统１９个企业共挖掘搞活资金２１０万元，流动资金周转也明显加快，提高了资金使用效益。
    许多企业在银根紧张之际不是观望等待，而是主动出击，眼睛向内想办法集聚资金。江苏省灌云县计经委直属工业企业在广泛发动职工集资入股的同时，还认真抓了积压产品和物资的清销，加紧资金周转。他们还对名优产品和市场紧俏商品采取先付款后供应和预付资金等方式吸引外界资金，同时，敛集社会闲置资金，增加企业财力，仅１９８８年底的４０天就筹措资金１２８２万元，为新的一年的生产打下了良好的基础。河北省永年县在资金缺口５５７０万元的情况下，积极挖掘地方潜力，到１９８８年１１月底，已收回逾期贷款７３３２万元，追回被骗、外欠和呆滞资金４２０万元，从而为粮、棉、油的收购筹集了大笔资金。
    值得注意的是，在解决资金不足的问题中，一些地区、部门和单位采取了不正当办法。例如有的金融机构在发放企业工资时强行搭配奖券，扣发一半工资强行储蓄和摊派存款等，引起了群众的反感。
