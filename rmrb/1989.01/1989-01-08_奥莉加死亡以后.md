	Olga, a 29-year-old woman from Leningrad, died on September 5 last year due to AIDS, becoming the first AIDS victim in the Soviet Union. During her lifetime, Olga worked as an operator at the Leningrad Thermal Power Trust. From February to August 1988, she visited the city's No. 30 Hospital 23 times due to illness and received 6 sick leave certificates. Within half a year, her weight dropped by 12 kilograms.

	On August 19, she was admitted to the First Medical Institute Affiliated Hospital in Leningrad. There, she had a blood test, but no AIDS virus was detected. She was diagnosed with pneumonia.

	On August 30, her mouth and upper respiratory tract developed extensive red rashes. She was transferred to the Mycology Hospital affiliated with the Medical College. Doctors diagnosed her with tonsillitis, bilateral pneumonia, and drug poisoning. On September 2, her condition worsened rapidly, and she had difficulty breathing. She was transferred to the resuscitation department of the hospital affiliated with the Ministry of Internal Affairs for another blood test. It was confirmed after her death on September 5 that she had AIDS.

	After Olga's death, doctors performed an autopsy and discovered that this single woman had been pregnant for four weeks. It was found that she had started prostitution 10 years ago. She had not only cohabited with Soviet citizens but also frequently associated with foreigners.

	Olga's death was like a silent bomb that exploded in Leningrad. The number of people voluntarily requesting blood tests increased tenfold! People exclaimed that the number of AIDS virus carriers in the Soviet Union would at least double from the current 83 cases!

	Public opinion reacted strongly, with some even raising the following questions: Why was Olga's first blood test negative for the AIDS virus? Was it due to poor reagents or negligence by the laboratory personnel?

	Some people also blamed the doctors for testing too late and ignoring the significant symptom of rapid weight loss, a clear indicator of AIDS. Someone asked, what if there had been no second blood test? What if the second blood test had also been a mistake? Then Olga's death would still be a mystery. Some even speculated based on Olga's experience that in the Soviet Union, Olga might not have been the first AIDS victim.

	After the Olga incident, the deputy director of the Leningrad Health Bureau, Borisova, and the chief physician of the Epidemic Prevention Station, Kurchanov, were given demerits. The director of the No. 30 Hospital, Radkevichna, was also dismissed.

	Not long after Olga's death, a 4.5-month-old male infant in Odessa became the second AIDS victim in the Soviet Union. It is said that his mother was a prostitute infected with the AIDS virus. This fact raised many new questions in the areas of morality and law.

　　奥莉加死亡以后
    邓兆熊
    去年９月５日，２９岁的列宁格勒妇女奥莉加被艾滋病夺去了生命，成为苏联第一个艾滋病牺牲者。奥莉加生前，曾在列宁格勒热能托拉斯当操作员，１９８８年２月至８月她因身体不适到该市第３０医院看过２３次病，领过６次病假证明书。半年之内，体重下降了１２公斤。
    ８月１９日她住入列宁格勒第一医学院附属医院。在那里曾验血，但没发现艾滋病毒。给她下的诊断是肺炎。
    ８月３０日，她的口腔、上呼吸道出现大量红疹。她被转到医师进修学院附属真菌病院。医生诊断是扁桃体炎、双侧肺炎、药物中毒。９月２日，她的病情急剧恶化，呼吸十分困难。把她转到内务局附属医院复苏科，又一次验血，在她９月５日死后确定是艾滋病。
    奥莉加死后，医生进行尸体解剖，才得知这个独身妇女已怀孕４个星期。据查明，她１０年前就已经开始卖淫。她不仅与苏联人同居过，而且还经常与外国人鬼混。
    奥莉加的死像一颗无声的炸弹在列宁格勒开了花。自愿要求验血者猛增１０倍！人们惊呼：苏联染上艾滋病毒者的数目从现有的８３人至少要增加一倍！
    舆论对此反应强烈，有人甚至提出了如下疑问：奥莉加第一次验血为什么没发现艾滋病毒？是试剂欠佳、还是化验人员失职？
    一些人还责怪医生验血过迟、忽视患者体重急剧减轻这个艾滋病的明显症状等。有人发问，要是没第二次验血呢？要是第二次验血也失误呢？那奥莉加的死至今还是个谜。有人甚至根据奥莉加的遭遇来推测，在苏联，奥莉加也许不是第一个艾滋病牺牲者。
    奥莉加事件发生后，列宁格勒卫生总局副局长鲍里索娃、卫生防疫站主任医师库尔恰诺夫受到记过处分，第３０医院科主任拉德凯维娜也被撤了职。
    奥莉加死后不久，敖德萨的一个４个半月的男婴成了苏联第二个艾滋病牺牲者。据说他的母亲就是一位染上了艾滋病毒的暗娼。这一事实，给人们在道德、法律方面又提出了许多新的问题。
