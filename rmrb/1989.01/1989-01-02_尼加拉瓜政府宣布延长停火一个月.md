The Nicaraguan government announced on December 31 that it would unilaterally extend the ceasefire with anti-government armed forces for another month to create conditions for ending the civil war.

The decision was announced by Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega. He said the ceasefire would be extended until the end of January 1989.

Ortega also called on the Nicaraguan anti-government forces and the U.S. government to take action during the extended ceasefire period to engage in dialogue with the Nicaraguan government and seek a political solution to the eight-year conflict.
