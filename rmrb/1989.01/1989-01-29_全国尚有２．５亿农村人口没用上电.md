	According to statistics from the Energy Department, China currently has 29 counties without electricity. Approximately 25% of rural households, totaling about 250 million people, do not have access to electricity. In 60% of the counties with electricity, the annual per capita electricity supply is less than 50 degrees. There are very few regions that can guarantee a supply of electricity for 100 days a year, and even fewer that can supply electricity for 200 days a year. The electricity shortage in rural areas nationwide is over 30%.

	The difficulties in rural electrification in China are specifically manifested in the following ways:

	No planned indicators. Currently, there is no unified indicator for rural electrification nationwide. Each province also lacks a clear indicator for rural electrification. Power supply departments only provide electricity to rural areas when there is surplus power in their local cities.

	Poor reliability of power supply. In times of power shortages, rural electricity is often treated as a flexible load and is arbitrarily cut off without a plan. Farmers' water pumps for drought relief and flood control are often turned on and off, making it difficult to carry out rescue work smoothly.

	Seasonal electricity use and farmers' living electricity needs cannot be guaranteed. During harvest and irrigation seasons, many electric-powered agricultural tools cannot operate due to power shortages, affecting normal agricultural production.

	High electricity costs and numerous surcharges. The electricity prices for rural use are generally higher than those for urban and industrial use. Farmers also need to pay for the installation of power lines and transformers themselves.

### 全国尚有２．５亿农村人口没用上电

　　全国尚有２．５亿农村人口没用上电
    据能源部统计，我国目前还有２９个无电县，全国２５％的农户约２．５亿农村人口没用上电，６０％的有电县年人均供电量不足５０度，每年能保证供电１００天的地区不多，能供电２００天的地区更是屈指可数，全国乡村用电量缺口达３０％以上。
    我国农村用电难具体表现在：
    没有计划指标。目前全国还没有一个统一的农村供电指标，各省对农村供电也没有一个明确的指标，供电部门只在本地城市还有富裕电力的情况下才向农村供电。
    供电可靠性差。在电力紧张的情况下，农电常被作为机动负荷，随意拉闸，无计划限电。农民抗旱排涝时的水泵常是开开停停，使救灾工作难以顺利进行。
    季节性用电和农民生活用电无法保证。每到收割、浇灌等季节，许多以电为动力的农具因缺电而无法工作，使正常的农业生产受到影响。
    收费高，附加多，农村用电的电费普遍高于城市用电及工业用电，农民还需要自己掏钱安装输电线路及变电设备。
