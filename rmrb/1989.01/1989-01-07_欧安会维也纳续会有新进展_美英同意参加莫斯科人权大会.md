The Vienna follow-up meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) has made new progress. The United States and the United Kingdom formally agreed today to participate in the 1991 Moscow Human Rights Conference, thereby removing the biggest obstacle that had hitherto hindered the successful conclusion of this follow-up meeting and the commencement of the all-European conventional arms control talks. Currently, representatives from Eastern and Western countries, as well as neutral and non-aligned nations, are negotiating the final documents of the follow-up meeting and the last details of the all-European conventional arms control talks. Diplomats from both sides in Vienna are optimistic that the Vienna follow-up meeting of the CSCE will conclude as scheduled before January 19.

According to reports, a spokesperson for the U.S. government in Los Angeles stated today that in recent years, the Soviet Union has made significant improvements in the area of human rights, releasing hundreds of political prisoners and ceasing interference with Western radio broadcasts. Additionally, the number of people emigrating abroad has increased significantly compared to previous years. The Reagan administration's agreement to participate in the Moscow Human Rights Conference is aimed at pushing the Soviet government to take bigger steps in this regard. Any regression will affect the U.S. attitude towards participating in the human rights conference. The British Foreign Office also demanded that the Soviet Union provide "effective guarantees" for further improvements in human rights before 1991.

The preliminary talks for the all-European conventional arms control negotiations, which will be included in the final document of the Vienna follow-up meeting of the CSCE, are proceeding smoothly. NATO and the Warsaw Pact have basically reached an agreement on the content, scope, and format of the talks. It is reported that the main obstacle, namely whether part of the territories of the Soviet Union and Turkey should be included in the scope of all-European conventional arms control, has also been basically resolved. The Soviet Union has proposed a comprehensive solution to the remaining issues in the talks. The Turkish side is satisfied with this. It is reported that the all-European conventional arms control negotiations will officially begin in Vienna in February.

Today, the head of the Soviet delegation to the Vienna follow-up meeting of the CSCE, Y. K. Kashelev, said in an article published in the Soviet newspaper *Pravda* that the *Final Document* has been basically drafted and is awaiting signature.

During this period, Austrian Foreign Minister Mock has invited all participating foreign ministers to Vienna from January 17 to 19 to attend the formal signing ceremony of the final document of the CSCE follow-up meeting.

　　欧安会维也纳续会有新进展
  　美英同意参加莫斯科人权大会
    新华社维也纳１月５日电  美国和英国今天正式表示同意参加１９９１年在莫斯科举行的人权大会，从而消除了迄今阻碍本次欧安会续会圆满结束和举行全欧常规裁军谈判的最大障碍。目前，与会的东西方及中立和不结盟国家的代表们正在就续会的最后文件和全欧常规裁军谈判的最后细节进行磋商。此间的东西方外交人士对欧安会维也纳续会按预定计划于１月１９日之前结束表示乐观。
    据报道，美国政府新闻发言人今天在洛杉矶表示，近年来，苏联在人权方面有了较大改善，释放了数百名政治犯并停止了对西方无线电广播的干扰，此外，移居国外的人数较以往有了明显的增加。里根政府同意参加莫斯科人权会议，就是要促使苏联政府在这方面迈出更大的步子，任何一种倒退都将影响到美国参加人权会议的态度。英国外交部也要求苏联在１９９１年以前对进一步改善人权作出“有效的保证”。
    即将载入欧安会维也纳续会最后文件的全欧常规军备裁军谈判的预备性会谈进展顺利。北约和华约基本上就会谈的内容、范围和形式达成一致。据悉，会谈的主要障碍即苏联和土耳其的部分领土是否纳入全欧常规裁军范围也已基本解决。苏联就会谈所遗留的最后一些问题提出了一个一揽子解决方案。土耳其方面对此感到满意。据悉，全欧常规军备裁军谈判将于２月在维也纳正式开始。
    参加欧安会维也纳续会的苏联代表团长尤·卡什列夫今天对苏联《真理报》发表讲话说，《最后文件》已基本起草完毕，只待签字。
    在此期间，奥地利外长莫克已向所有与会国外长发出邀请，于１月１７日至１９日在维也纳参加举行欧安会续会最后文件的正式签字仪式。
