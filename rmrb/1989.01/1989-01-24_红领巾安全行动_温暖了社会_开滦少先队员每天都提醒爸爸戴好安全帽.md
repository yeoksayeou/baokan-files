The "Little Red Scarf Safety Action" Warms Society
Kailuan Young Pioneers Remind Their Fathers to Wear Safety Helmets Every Day

New China News Agency, Beijing, January 23 (Reporter Sun Yong) "Dad, when you go down to the mine, you must wear your safety helmet!" For the 260,000 Young Pioneers in the Kailuan Mining Bureau of Hebei Province, saying this to their parents every day has become a habit.

According to statistics, after participating in the Little Red Scarf Safety Action, more than ten million Young Pioneers across the country have prevented six major railway accidents and avoided hundreds of traffic accidents and fires. A wave of learning and promoting safety is surging among young children.

The "National Little Red Scarf Safety Action" began in April last year. At that time, Premier Li Peng wrote a letter to children across the country, saying: "Production safety and social safety are very important. The Young Pioneers have many things to do in the cause of building socialist modernization in our motherland."

Since then, the Little Red Scarf Safety Action has been carried out among Young Pioneers across the country. The organizers of this activity, the China Youth Daily, require the Little Red Scarves to: write a safety letter, conduct a safety investigation, dissuade one unsafe behavior, learn one safety skill, and say one safety phrase to their parents every day.

Children's sincere words every day warm the hearts of millions of parents, and hundreds of thousands of safety letters move countless uncles, aunts, brothers, and sisters in various industries. In the Zibo Mining Bureau of Shandong Province, children embroidered safety slogans on handkerchiefs, lunch bags, and wrote them on small wooden signs, giving them to workers and passersby. Workers were moved to express that for the sake of the children, they also wanted to return home safely.

The responsible person of the China Youth Daily announced today that the National Little Red Scarf Safety Action has achieved fruitful results. Tens of thousands of Young Pioneers have been awarded the title of "National Safety Little Guardians," 79 collectives have been named "Advanced Collectives of Safety Little Guardians," and 50 Young Pioneers have been awarded the title of "National Safety Little Heroes." Before the Spring Festival, 20 little heroes and representatives of advanced collectives will go to Beijing to report.

　　“红领巾安全行动”温暖了社会    
    开滦少先队员每天都提醒爸爸戴好安全帽
    新华社北京１月２３日电（记者孙勇）“爸爸，下矿井您一定要戴好安全帽！”对河北省开滦矿务局２．６万名少先队员来说，每天向父母说这句话，已经成了习惯。
    据统计，全国上千万少先队员在参加红领巾安全行动后，防止了铁路重大事故６起，避免道路交通伤亡事故、火灾上百起。一个从小学安全、讲安全的热潮正在少年儿童中形成。
    “全国红领巾安全行动”是从去年４月开始的。国务院总理李鹏当时给全国的小朋友写信说：“生产安全和社会安全十分重要。少先队在祖国的社会主义现代化建设事业中有许多事情可做。”
    此后，红领巾安全行动便在全国少先队员中开展起来。这一活动的组织者——中国少年报要求红领巾们做到：写一封安全信，搞一次安全调查，劝阻一个不安全行为，学一门安全知识，并每天对父母说一句安全话。
    孩子们每天一句情真意切的话语，温暖了千千万万父母的心，千百万封安全信，感动了各行各业无数叔叔阿姨、哥哥姐姐。在山东淄博矿务局，孩子们把安全警句绣在手帕上、干粮袋上，写在小木牌上，送给工人和来往行人。工人们感动地表示，为了孩子，他们也要平平安安回家。
    中国少年报负责人今天在此间宣布：全国红领巾安全行动，取得了丰硕成果。几万名少先队员荣获“全国安全小卫士”称号，７９个集体被评为“安全小卫士”先进集体，５０名少先队员被授予“全国安全小功臣”称号。春节前，２０名小功臣和先进集体代表将进京汇报。
