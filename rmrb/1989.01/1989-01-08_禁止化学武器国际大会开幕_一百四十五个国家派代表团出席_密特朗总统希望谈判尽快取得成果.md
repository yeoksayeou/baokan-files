The international conference on the prohibition of chemical weapons opened today in the headquarters of UNESCO in Paris. Representatives from 145 countries attended the conference (with approximately 80 delegations led by their respective foreign ministers). This is one of the largest international conferences in many years to discuss the issue of prohibiting chemical weapons.

The opening ceremony was presided over by French President François Mitterrand. Around 10 AM, President Mitterrand, along with UN Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar and UNESCO Director-General Federico Mayor, ascended the stage. Director-General Mayor and Secretary-General de Cuéllar delivered speeches. De Cuéllar stated that over 100 countries' representatives gathered here today, reflecting the strong desire of people worldwide for the complete prohibition of chemical weapons. He expressed that the UN would continue to contribute in areas such as investigation, verification, and supervision to support the prohibition of chemical weapons.

President Mitterrand emphasized the significance of this conference in his speech. He said that the world is facing a serious threat from chemical weapons, requiring the highest level of leadership to discuss the prohibition of chemical weapons. President Mitterrand cited changes in conflicts around the world, stating that there is now an atmosphere of détente and understanding everywhere, and significant progress has been made in arms reduction. People should seize this opportunity to expedite the negotiations on chemical weapons to achieve results.

The main objectives of this conference are twofold: first, to reaffirm the importance of the 1925 Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare; and second, to promote the ongoing multilateral negotiations in Geneva to reach a common agreement within the framework of the Conference on Disarmament regarding the prohibition of the production of chemical weapons. He believes that the best way to prohibit the use of chemical weapons is to prohibit their production and possession.

Today morning, the conference's press center gathered hundreds of journalists from various countries. A widely discussed issue is whether the recent incident of the United States shooting down a Libyan aircraft would affect this conference. French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas has publicly stated that France hopes the dispute between the U.S. and Libya will not alter the conference agenda. Yesterday afternoon, after arriving in Paris, U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz met with Prime Minister Michel Rocard and President Mitterrand, briefing them on the U.S. accusations against a Libyan chemical plant. According to reports, President Mitterrand expressed that resolving the issue of the Libyan chemical plant is not just about direct military conflict but also involves other feasible methods. During the conference, Shultz will also meet with the Soviet Foreign Minister and representatives from other countries.

　　禁止化学武器国际大会开幕
    一百四十五个国家派代表团出席
    密特朗总统希望谈判尽快取得成果
    本报巴黎１月７日电  记者张启华报道：举世瞩目的禁止化学武器国际大会今天在巴黎联合国教科文组织总部大厦隆重开幕。１４５个国家派出代表团参加会议（其中约８０个代表团由该国外交部长率领），这是许多年来一次规模最大的讨论禁止化学武器问题的国际会议。
    开幕仪式由法国总统密特朗主持。上午１０时许，密特朗总统与联合国秘书长佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔、联合国教科文组织总干事马约尔等走上主席台。马约尔总干事和德奎利亚尔秘书长发表讲话。德奎利亚尔说，今天有１００多个国家的代表聚集在一起，表明全世界人民对彻底禁止化学武器的强烈愿望。他表示，联合国将一如既往，在调查、核证、监督等方面为禁止化学武器作出自己的贡献。
    密特朗总统在讲话中强调了这次会议的重要意义。他说，世界面临着化学武器的严重威胁，需要由最高一层的领导人来讨论禁止化学武器问题。密特朗总统列举了世界各地区冲突的变化，他说，现在世界到处出现了缓和、谅解的气氛，裁减军备也已取得令人赞赏的进展，人们应该利用这个时机，促使化学武器的谈判尽快获得成果。
    这次会议的目的主要有两方面，一是重申１９２５年禁止使用化学武器议定书的重要意义；二是推动目前正在日内瓦进行的多边谈判，使之在裁军会议范围内就禁止生产化学武器问题也达成一项共同的协议。他认为，禁止使用化学武器的最好办法是禁止生产和拥有化学武器。
    今天上午，会议新闻中心聚集了数百名各国记者。人们普遍关心的问题是，几天前发生的美国击落利比亚飞机事件可能对这次会议带来的影响。法国外长迪马已公开表示，法国希望美、利的争执不要改变会议的议程。昨天下午，美国国务卿舒尔茨到达巴黎后，先后会见了罗卡尔总理、密特朗总统。向他们通报了美国对利比亚一家化工厂的指控。据报道，密特朗总统表示，解决利比亚化工厂提出的问题，不止是直接军事冲突，还有别的可行办法。在会议期间，舒尔茨还要会晤苏联外长和其它一些国家的代表。
