Title: Golden Memories

Going to work, the journey is long, requiring transfers between two or three buses. On the bus, you hear various boring conversations and endless arguments. After getting off the bus, you still have to walk a long, unpoetic stretch of sandy road. Thus, you become extremely tired and indifferent. The people, things, flowers, and trees outside the car window all become boring.

Suddenly, one day, a flash of gold enters the window, dazzling the eyes. Looking out, it is a grove of ginkgo trees. Tens of thousands of small, fan-shaped leaves shine golden and happily sway towards the sun, making my heart, which has become indifferent, flutter.

Before I knew it, it was already autumn.

Autumn should be a season full of poetry and picturesque scenery. Poets sing of it, painters depict it, and laborers harvest its sweet, sour, and bitter fruits. But what about us, who every day merge into the crowded human flow, frantically rushing into buses to go to and from work? We have no harvest, only a reminder: it's getting cold.

Thus, life becomes meaningless. In autumn, leaves fall one by one, geese fly south in flocks, and people's faces begin to wrinkle. The moisture of summer is sucked away by the autumn wind. The desolation and sadness tell us that a long, harsh winter is waiting for you, me, and him.

Everything is silently, wordlessly waiting for that winter day.

Yet, there is this ginkgo tree, smiling radiantly at the world, displaying its splendor and glory with the brightest gold.

In its life, that moment is its most brilliant peak.

Compared to those pines and cypresses that have been praised by people for thousands of years to the point of almost being worshipped, don't you think the ginkgo lives more freely, more carefree?

We often feel too tired, too monotonous, as if we have almost no chance to shine in life. But in reality, this chance is often ignored or suppressed by ourselves.

Perhaps it is simply because we do not live freely enough, carrying too much mundane burden.

In our lives, there is already too much of the "pine and cypress spirit," evergreen and evergreen, unchanging, like a sage always in deep thought, always in silent contemplation. When will we be able to live like the ginkgo, with the green of spring, the shade of summer, the harvest of autumn, and a brilliant, radiant moment?

If we could be like this, why bother whether we live "forever" or die young?

Autumn gradually deepens and cools. That golden hue moves to the ground, laying a soft carpet of leaves for people. A little girl in a red wool skirt is learning to walk, and an old man with silver hair is practicing breathing exercises.

Perhaps the old man once had a brilliant moment? Perhaps the little girl will have a brilliant moment in the future?

I don't know, the answer is in each person's heart.

All those who pass by this grove of ginkgo trees in that brilliant gold will have a golden memory and a golden enlightenment in their hearts. Even in the harsh winter, there are only bare branches reaching towards the sky and withered grass huddled on the ground.

But that golden story is not far away.

Next year, there will be another new brilliance.

And what about us humans?

　　金色的回忆
    岑献青
    去上班，路途遥遥，换乘两三次公共汽车，在车上听各种无聊的谈话和无休无止的争吵。下了车，还要走一段长长的毫无诗意的沙土路，于是人极疲倦，于是变得漠然，车窗外的人、物、花、树，便成了无聊的东西。
    忽然有一天，窗外闪进一片金黄来，晃得人眼熠熠，看去，却是一带银杏林。数万张扇形小叶黄灿灿地在枝干上欢快地向太阳摇着，不禁令我这已变得漠然了的人心中怦然一动。
    不觉间已是秋天了。
    秋天该是一个充满诗情画意的季节，诗人吟它，画家描它，劳作者收获它的甜酸苦辣。而我们这些每日汇入拥挤的人流中、拚命涌进汽车里去上班下班的人呢？没有收获，只是得到一个提醒：天凉了。
    于是生活变得没意思起来。秋天，树叶一片片地落下，大雁一群群地往南飞，人们的脸开始起皱，夏日的湿润让秋风吮吸了。萧瑟和悲凉告诉人们，将有一个漫漫的严冬在等着你、我、他。
    一切都在无言地、默默地等着那个冬日。
    然而却有这银杏向着世界灿烂地笑，用最明快的金黄来显示它的华丽、它的辉煌。
    在它的生命中，那一瞬间是它最光辉的顶点。
    比起那些千百年来备受人们推崇称赞到几乎要顶礼膜拜的松柏来，你不觉得银杏活得更飘逸、更潇洒么？
    我们常觉得太累，太单调，一辈子几乎没有过生命曝光的机会。而实在的，这种机会，大约常常是被我们自己忽视了或窒息了。
    也许这仅仅是因为我们活得不洒脱，带了太多的俗气的缘故。
    我们的生活中，已经太多了那几乎成为信念了的“松柏精神”，常年绿常年青，一成不变，哲人似的永远只在沉思，只在默念。什么时候，才能像银杏那样，既有春天的吐绿，夏日的荫凉，秋时的收获，更有一个光辉灿烂的瞬间呢？
    倘若能如此，又何必在乎活得“天长地久”还是“命短夭折”呢？
    秋渐渐地深、渐渐地凉了，那一片金黄移到树下，为人们铺了一层软和的叶毯。一个着红毛线裙的小姑娘在蹒跚学步，一位满头银发的老翁在运气练功。
    老翁也许曾有过辉煌的瞬间？小姑娘将来或许也有一个辉煌的瞬间？
    不知道，答案只在每个人的心中。
    所有在那灿烂的金色中路过这一带银杏林的人们，心里都留下了一个金色的回忆和一个金色的启示。尽管在严冬，这里只剩下了伸向天穹的秃枝和蜷伏地面的枯草。
    但那金色的故事并不遥远。
    下一年，还会有一次新的辉煌。
    而我们人呢？
