    The Communist Party Committee and government of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region have recently decided to clean up fixed asset construction projects. They have determined to halt or suspend 94 ongoing projects, reducing the total investment by 322.84 million yuan. Among these, 12 key projects for buildings and facilities have been identified for reduction, with a total construction area of 39,892 square meters and an investment of 15.18 million yuan. Additionally, 17 high-energy-consuming industrial projects have been identified for reduction, with a total investment of 199.58 million yuan.

    The Ningxia Party Committee and government require all local governments and departments to, during the cleanup process, halt and suspend a batch of projects and publicize a batch. For halted projects, banks will stop lending, material supply departments will stop supplying materials, power departments will stop supplying electricity, construction management departments will revoke construction permits, and industrial and commercial management departments will revoke establishment permits. For those places, departments, and units that fail to clean up or engage in fraud, the main leaders and direct responsible persons will be held accountable.
