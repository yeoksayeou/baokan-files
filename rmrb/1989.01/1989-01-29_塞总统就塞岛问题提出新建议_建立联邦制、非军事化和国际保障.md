Cypriot President, Greek Cypriot leader Vasiliou, will propose new suggestions regarding the Cyprus issue to explain the stance of the Greek Cypriots.

A document, including the new suggestions and drafted by a special working committee, was submitted to the House of Representatives earlier this week and was approved at a meeting of the House of Representatives today.

According to local newspapers, the new suggestions include basic principles for a comprehensive solution to the Cyprus issue. These principles include the establishment of a federal system, demilitarization, international guarantees, the withdrawal of Turkish residents, and the safeguarding of freedom and human rights.

Meanwhile, Cypriot Turkish leader Denktash also announced that he will add some new suggestions based on his previously proposed suggestions.

To resolve the conflict between the Greek and Turkish Cypriots, since mid-September last year, Vasiliou and Denktash, the two leaders, have held two rounds of talks under the auspices of the United Nations, but no significant progress has been made.

　　塞总统就塞岛问题提出新建议  建立联邦制、非军事化和国际保障
    新华社尼科西亚１月２７日电  据塞浦路斯通讯社今天报道，塞浦路斯总统、希族领导人瓦西利乌将就塞浦路斯问题提出新建议，以解释希族人的立场。
    由一个特别工作委员会起草的包括新建议的文件已在本周早些时候递交国民议会，并在国民议会今天举行的会议上获得批准。
    据此间报纸透露，新建议包括全面解决塞浦路斯问题的基本原则，其中有建立联邦制度、非军事化和国际保障、撤出土耳其居民、保障自由和人权等内容。
    与此同时，塞浦路斯土族领导人登克塔什也宣布他将在原已提出建议的基础上增加一些新的建议。
    为解决塞岛希族和土族之间的冲突，自去年９月中旬以来，瓦西利乌同登克塔什两位领导人在联合国的主持下已经举行了两轮会谈，但均未获得明显进展。
