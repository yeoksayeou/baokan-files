Title: Unconstrained by Form: Reflections on the "Fenghua Miscellany Essay Contest"
Author: Qin Mo

Edition: 8

The People's Daily Literary Department and the Fenghua Machinery Factory jointly organized the Fenghua Miscellany Essay Contest, which lasted for over three months. During this period, the People's Daily published 61 essays from the contest. According to the editors, these were selected from over 7,000 submissions. The ratio of 7,000:61 not only highlights the excellence of the selected works but also indicates the large number of people who enjoy writing miscellany essays and the many who struggle to master this literary form. It is said that the winning and published works will be compiled into a book. Such a collection of fine miscellany essays will not only provide a showcase for miscellany enthusiasts but also offer a reference for those who practice the form. "He Shan's stones can be used to polish jade." Among these "stones," there are certainly many that contain "precious jade." To my knowledge, this miscellany essay contest, in terms of the number of participants, the quantity of selected works, the breadth of awards, and the amount of the prizes, is probably the largest-scale event since the May Fourth Movement. The flourishing of miscellany essays is a sign of democracy. This contest may be seen as the crowing of the morning rooster, a powerful call.

As a judge, I have read all the published miscellany essays. The process of reading, on the one hand, required me to make selections, but on the other hand, it naturally involved learning. After reading, what are my thoughts? First, I benefited greatly, "The little one here offers his respects." Second, the content and styles of these essays are diverse and fascinating. While there are indeed some excellent works by famous authors, the outstanding entries from the general public are, I would say, even more brilliant. "Many people produce a Han Xin," "A good man cannot withstand three opponents," "Among three people walking together, there is bound to be my teacher." These proverbs and sayings spontaneously came to my mind. Third, these miscellany essays criticize various social ills, but the phenomenon of "official profiteering" is a prominent focus. This collective attack should be seen as a public condemnation of corruption and lawbreakers and as a call for stricter legislation and enforcement.

Diverse content requires rich forms, "Measure the cloth before cutting," how can the "style" be uniform? Currently, many miscellany essays habitually begin with a quotation from an ancient book, followed by a few comments, and then conclude. Some people liken this to "miscellany writers wearing dragon robes, jade belts, and thick-soled boots." Although this writing style has its place (any method of expression should be allowed), if it becomes a routine and a formula, there is room for discussion. From the essays published this time, the content is varied, and the methods of expression are not constrained by any single form. This is very inspiring.

In literary forms, miscellany essays are the most focused on reasoning, and their imagery is generally not very rich. However, some of the published essays this time adopt the form of short stories or sketches, making the articles rich and substantial, with the "bones" covered by plump "muscles." For example, "AQ Really Became Wealthy," "A Food Connoisseur's Confession," "A Biography of the Surf Rider," "A Peddler's Strange Tale," and "Zhuangzi Buys Water" are all like this. In vivid descriptions, they embed theoretical criticism, making the literary imagery of miscellany essays much stronger, which is very worth appreciating.

Some works start from very ordinary phenomena, narrate them layer by layer, and finally explain profound truths, which is admirable. For example, "Respect for the Public Principles of Human Society," "The Earthworm Phenomenon," "Pseudo-science and the Pursuit of Status," and "It's Not Too Late" are all like this. This type of reasoning miscellany essay is also very engaging.

Some works, either by reversing the topic or by discussing it humorously, convey another layer of meaning in laughter and ridicule, making one deeply feel the power of satire. For example, "An Enviable Profession" and "The Taste of Being Alive" are like this.

In my opinion, miscellany essays, from content to form, should be diverse and unconstrained, with criticism, satire, praise, explanation of principles, and description of scenery, all of which should be present. The methods can be varied and diverse. In short, miscellany essays should be unconstrained by form. Some people think that miscellany essays only have criticism and satire, with no other paths. As soon as they mention praise, they think it must necessarily be a flattering work, and miscellany essays should not have a "flattering bone." I do not think that praise miscellany essays are necessarily flattering. The question is what you praise, whether it is appropriate, and whether it embodies the truth. Praising Peng Dehuai is precisely to criticize the suppression of democracy, and praising Zhang Zhixin is precisely to criticize the evil deeds of the past. What is the "flattering bone" about?

I personally appreciate most of the published contest essays, but I did not vote in favor of every single one. I think some works have reasoning that is not rigorous, and some have the flaw of generalizing from a single case, "The net is too loose, and the fish slip away." Only rigorous and thorough reasoning can make logic force people to face the truth.

When democracy thrives, direct miscellany essays thrive; when democracy is insufficient, indirect miscellany essays thrive. When democratic spirit is waning, both direct and indirect miscellany essays disappear, and that is a silent era. In a silent era, there must be underground fires surging and storms brewing. History shows that such examples are not uncommon. Our country's democracy is advancing with difficulty. Since a society as pure as distilled water will never exist, let miscellany essays flourish! I think this People's Daily Fenghua Miscellany Essay Contest should be a signal of the growing prosperity of miscellany essays. If someone says too much, what should we do? No problem, let's have a debate.

### 不拘一格出杂文——读“风华杂文征文”一得

　　不拘一格出杂文
    ——读“风华杂文征文”一得
    秦牧
    人民日报文艺部和贵州风华机器厂联合举办的风华杂文征文活动，历时三个多月，在这段时间里，人民日报上刊登了应征的６１篇杂文。据编辑同志说，这是从７０００多篇作品中精选出来的。７０００∶６１，这个比例既说明拔萃之作的精采，也说明爱写杂文者人数的众多，又说明爱写杂文但却未能很好掌握这种文学形式的大有人在。听说将来得奖的和已经刊登的作品要辑成一书出版。这样的精华杂文集，就不但可给杂文爱好者以观览，也可供杂文习作者观摩了。“他山之石，可以攻玉”。这里面的“石头”，含有“美玉”的肯定不少。据我所知，这次的杂文征文活动，从应征者的众多、入选文章的数量、受奖面之广、奖额之高等方面来看，大概是五四运动以来最大规模的一次了。民主兴杂文盛，这次的征文活动，也许可以视作报晓晨鸡，亢声的一唱。
    作为评委，我遍读了那已经刊出的杂文。阅读的过程，一方面固然得进行评选，另一方面，也自然而然，体现了一种学习。读毕之后有些什么感想呢？一是得益不浅，“小的这厢有礼了”。二是它们的内容风格多姿多采，的确很可玩味，名家固然有些写得很好，但是群众来稿中的出类拔萃者，毋宁说更加精彩。“人多出韩信”，“好汉难抵三把手”，“三人行，必有吾师焉”。这些俗谚和格言，不期而然地涌上我的心头。三是这些杂文抨击的时弊，虽然涉及好些方面，“官倒”现象却是一个突出的重心。这种群起而攻之的现象，应该视作是对贪污受贿和不法分子的舆论制裁，也是盼有更严格的立法和执法的一阵边鼓。
    纷繁的内容要求丰富的形式，“量体裁衣”，“衣型”哪能一律？现在有不少杂文习惯于引一段古书典故之后，发挥几句议论，交卷大吉。有人喻之为“杂文家穿着蟒袍玉带厚底儿靴”，虽然这种写作形式自有它一定的位置（任何表现手法都是应该容许的），但如果习为常规，形成程式，却就不无可以议论之处了。从这次发表的征文看来，内容多样，表现手法不拘一格，这是很能够给人们以启发的。
    在文学形式中最偏重于说理的杂文，本来形象性一般是并不怎样饱满的。这次发表的征文中，有好些却采取了故事小品的形式，把文章写得丰腴，“骨头”都被饱满的“肌肉”盖起来了。例如《阿Ｑ真地阔了起来》《美食家自白》《“弄潮儿”简历》《小贩说奇》《庄周买水》等篇，就是这样，在绘声绘影的描述中，寓理论批判于其中，这类作品使杂文的文学形象性大大增强起来，很值得玩味。
    有一些作品，从十分平常的事象说起，娓娓道来，层层深入，终至于阐释了很深刻的道理，令人赞赏。例如《对人类社会公理的敬畏》、《蚯蚓现象》、《穷拔高与伪科学》、《还来得及》等篇就是这样。这类阐理性的杂文，也大有看头的。
    还有一些作品，或正题反作，或谈笑风生，而在嬉笑怒骂之中，寄寓了另一层的意思，令人深刻感受到讽刺的力量。例如《令人艳羡的职业》《活着的滋味》等，就是这样。
    我个人以为，杂文从内容到形式，都应该多采多姿，不拘一格，鞭挞的，讽刺的，歌颂的，阐释事理的，描绘风物的，都应该有，手法大可纷繁多样。一句话，应该不拘一格出杂文。有人以为杂文只有鞭挞讽刺，别无他道。一提歌颂性的，就以为必然会粉饰太平，而杂文决不应该有“媚骨”。我并不认为歌颂性的杂文必定是媚骨的产物。问题是看你歌颂什么，是否恰如其分，是否体现真理。歌颂彭德怀正所以批判压制民主的现象，歌颂张志新正所以鞭挞当年倒行逆施的丑类，这有何“媚骨”？
    发表的应征杂文，我对多数都很赞赏，但并不是对任何一篇都投赞成票。我认为有个别作品，说理并不周密，有的还存在着以偏概全的缺点，“网眼太疏，鱼就溜掉了”。只有严密周到的说理，逻辑的力量才能够使人非面向真理不可。
    民主兴，则直笔的杂文兴，民主不足，则曲笔的杂文兴。民主气息奄奄，直笔曲笔的杂文都没有了，那就是无声的时代。无声的时代，必然有地火在奔突，有风暴在酝酿。证之历史，这类的事例是屡见不鲜的。我国的民主正在步履艰难地推进，蒸馏水般纯净的社会既然永远不会有，那么就该让杂文兴盛起来吧？我想，这次人民日报的风华杂文征文活动，应该是杂文日渐兴盛的一个信号。如果有人说过头话怎么办？没问题，大家来一场思想交锋就是了。
