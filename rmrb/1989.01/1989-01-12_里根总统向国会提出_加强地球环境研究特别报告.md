Reagan Submits Special Report to Congress on Strengthening Earth Environment Research

	New York, Jan. 11 (Xinhua) - According to foreign reports, U.S. President Reagan submitted a special report on strengthening Earth environment research to Congress on the 9th, proposing that the U.S. spend $190 million this year on research related to global warming and ozone layer depletion. This is the first time the U.S. government has attached such importance to Earth environment research and significantly increased research funding.

	The report states that the purpose of the U.S. government's proposal is to improve the monitoring and understanding of global climate conditions, enabling scientists to more accurately predict global climate changes, and allowing the international community to formulate reasonable policies to adapt to environmental changes.

	The report states that the U.S. government will allocate a large sum of money this year to study climate change, with participating departments including the National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy, the Department of Agriculture, the Geological Survey, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The funds will primarily be used for research on the "greenhouse effect."

　　里根总统向国会提出
    加强地球环境研究特别报告
    新华社北京１月１１日电  据外电报道，美国总统里根９日向国会提出加强地球环境研究特别报告，建议美国今年开支１．９亿美元进行全球气候变热和臭氧层减损的研究工作。美国政府如此重视地球环境研究和大幅度增加研究费用属首次。
    报告说，美国政府这一建议的目的是改进对世界气候情况的监视和了解，使科学工作者能更准确地预测全球气候变化情况，使国际社会能制订合理的政策以适应环境的变化。
    报告说，美国政府今年将拨出巨款用于研究气候变化情况，参加研究工作的有国家科学基金会、能源部、农业部、地质勘查局、全国海洋和大气管理局和航空航天局等部门。经费主要用于“温室效应”的研究工作。
