	In 1988, the per capita book purchase expenditure in China, with a population of 1 billion, was 4.7 yuan. Ten years ago, in 1978, this figure was 1 yuan. Over the past decade, the amount people spend on buying books has shown a steady upward trend.

	According to data from the Xinhua Bookstore headquarters, there are now 9,300 Xinhua Bookstore sales points nationwide. There are 55,500 sales points in grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives. In recent years, 40,000 collective bookstalls and 70,000 individual bookstalls have emerged. These sales points, scattered across urban and rural areas, have formed a network for the distribution and sale of books, promoting the exchange of book information, making it convenient for the public to buy books, and starting to activate the market competition mechanism. A new pattern of writing, printing, and distribution is taking shape.

	Although local Xinhua Bookstores face the severe challenge of multi-channel distribution, the overall trend of book sales over the past decade has been upward. In 1988, the national Xinhua Bookstore book sales reached 5.1 billion yuan, an increase of 4.5 times compared to 1978.
