Iranian President Khamenei today told visiting Soviet First Deputy Foreign Minister Vorontsov that Iran welcomes all actions that lead to a cessation of bloodshed in Afghanistan.

Khamenei, during his meeting with Vorontsov, praised the Soviet Union's plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan. He expressed the hope that Afghanistan would become an independent, non-aligned country.

According to a broadcast by Tehran Radio, Vorontsov informed the Iranian leadership that, as announced, the Soviet Union would withdraw its troops from Afghanistan.

Vorontsov, during his visit, sought Iran's support for the Soviet Union's plan and attempted to thwart U.S. policy on the Afghanistan issue. He said, "The U.S. does not want peace in Afghanistan. We are determined to expose its plots."

He arrived here yesterday and held two rounds of talks with the eight-party alliance based in Iran. He said the Soviet Union had decided to resolve the Afghanistan issue through peaceful means and political negotiations.

Vorontsov will conclude his visit this afternoon.
