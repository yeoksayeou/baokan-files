Taiwan has experienced severe air pollution in recent days, with seven environmental monitoring stations north of Chiayi issuing emergency alerts yesterday. The Taiwan "Environmental Protection Agency" has urged the elderly, weak, women, and children to reduce outdoor activities as much as possible.

According to observations by the Taiwan "Central Weather Bureau," a high-pressure system has been circulating over Taiwan in recent days, creating an inversion layer that prevents ground-level pollutants from dispersing into the atmosphere. For several days, the Taiwan region has been shrouded in a haze of pollution, with some areas reaching or approaching the "severe deterioration" warning level.

　　台空气污染严重  “环保署”呼吁减少外出
    新华社香港１月９日电  台北消息：台湾地区连日来空气污染持续恶化，昨天嘉义以北的七个环保监测站同时发布紧急警报。台湾“环保署”呼吁老弱妇幼尽量减少外出。
    据台湾“中央气象局”的观测，连日来台湾上空出现高压回流，产生逆温层，使地面的空气污染物无法扩散到大气中。几天来，台湾地区一直笼罩在一片污染烟雾当中，部分地区的污染指标已达到或接近“急劣化”警戒线。
