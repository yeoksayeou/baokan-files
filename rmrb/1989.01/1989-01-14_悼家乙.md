Title: In Memory of Wang Jia Yi

Wang Jia Yi passed away on November 27 of last year. Many days have passed, but I still feel that he lingers in my heart, and I cannot let him go.

In May 1965, after the Ministry of Culture's rectification, I left Beijing for Chongqing. Wang Yi and Wang Jia Yi, the two brothers, hurriedly came to see me off. I remember that at the time, I had some doubts in my heart, thinking that they were from the Changchun Film Studio and should not have come... Jia Yi did not say anything, just had a bewildered smile on his face.

Among the five people who saw me off that day, Hai Mo, Tian Fang, Cui Wei, and Wang Yi have all passed away. I did not even have the chance to say a final goodbye. I never expected that Jia Yi, who is a few years younger than me, would also leave after we shook hands warmly at the opening ceremony of the Literary and Art Workers' Congress.

The reason I felt that Jia Yi should not have come to see me off was that I had just been accused of being the "black backer" of a group of creators at the Changchun Film Studio. Many of the issues involved Jia Yi.

The most obvious example is "Daji and Her Father." Just as the film was being shot, I went to the Changchun Film Studio. The director and the main actors were struggling with a scene where Daji hears that her biological father has come to take her away, leaving her adoptive father, a member of an ethnic minority, in tears. Is this promoting "humanism"? I affirmed Jia Yi's handling of the scene. Later, the film was screened at the 1961 National Feature Film Creation Conference, and Jia Yi's speech caused a stir. He said that when he was shooting this film, he always felt like he was riding a horse on the edge of humanism, sweating from head to toe, fearing that he would fall into the abyss of revisionism.

It was not until Premier Zhou personally watched the novel and the film that the film was fully affirmed. The Premier also said that he saw the scene where Daji and her adoptive father cried, and his tears were about to flow, but the director did not dare to let people cry, so the actors covered their faces with their hands...

After this conference, Jia Yi had a heart-to-heart talk with me, saying that since the anti-rightist and anti-rightist deviation movements, he had seen batch after batch of creators at the Changchun Film Studio fall—forty-plus people had been criticized, struggled against, expelled, or advised to withdraw from the party. He also recounted with tears in his eyes how he was criticized as a "class enemy." Finally, he said with a heavy heart that he had always followed the party's words, but he had doubts: "After the Yan'an Rectification, the 'rescue' campaign expanded, and Chairman Mao said that if so many party members and intellectuals were all spies, it could only mean that our party had failed. Then, in recent years, many party cadres at the Changchun Film Studio have fallen, can't we say that our party's policy towards intellectuals has failed?"

At that time, I could not and did not dare to answer this bold question. I also did not expect that in August 1962, at a meeting convened by the Jilin Provincial Party Committee with key party members of the Changchun Film Studio, Jia Yi's speech actually raised this bold question, which was recorded and doomed. During the Cultural Revolution, it naturally became a shocking, "audacious slander against the leader" and an anti-party statement!

Perhaps both of us still had a bit of the conscience of intellectuals, forming an unspoken agreement, and did not expose each other's remarks.

Recalling this segment of history, I cannot help but feel deeply moved. The absurd history of more than 20 years has finally passed, and Jia Yi has quietly left. I heard that before he passed away, he was still muttering in his delirium, wanting to return to the Changchun Film Studio to make films.

The films he participated in and directed, such as "The Bridge," "The Kite," "Five Golden Flowers," "Golden Jade," "Daji and Her Father," and "The Young Generation," are not only outstanding films of the Changchun Film Studio but also of the entire country since the founding of the nation. This is his true historical image.

If he could truly discard the fear of falling into the abyss of humanism and revisionism while riding a horse on the edge of a knife, if he had not experienced the disaster of the Cultural Revolution, with Jia Yi's talent and enthusiasm for portraying new things, couldn't he have left us more sincere and moving poems?

In the midst of deep feelings, I still want to take this opportunity to say a few sincere words:

First, I hope that those who always blame others and think they are always correct will, in the face of the experiences and works of these departed people, think about what they have left for the people!

Second, I also hope that the younger generation of film workers will think about the bumpy experiences of the older generation of film artists, think about the unprecedented creative freedom they have in the face of reform and opening up, and in the face of 1 billion people, what they will leave for the people!

Art is ultimately art, not some "thing." Those who "play" with art cannot become true artists and cannot truly write moving poems for history.

What film did Jia Yi want to shoot before he passed away? He left me with a question. But I am sure that what he cherished was true art, not vulgar commodities!

　　悼家乙
    荒煤
    王家乙同志去世（去年１１月２７日）已经过了很多天，但我的确感到，他还在我心头徘徊，我还不能把他送走。
    １９６５年５月文化部整风后，我离开北京去重庆那一天，王逸、王家乙两兄弟匆匆赶来送我。我记得，当时我心里还有些嘀咕，他们是长影的，不该来……家乙什么也没有讲，只是一脸惶惑的笑容。
    那天送我的五人中，海默、田方、崔嵬、王逸同志都已走了，我都来不及作一次最后的告别。真没想到，比我还小几岁的家乙——在文代会开幕式上见到，还高高兴兴和我热烈握手，就见了这一面，他也走了。
    我那时之所以觉得家乙不该来送我，是因为我刚刚被指控为长影一批创作人员的黑后台。其中不少问题都牵扯到家乙。
    最明显的例子是《达吉和她的父亲》。正好在影片拍摄期间我到长影去了，导演、主要演员都正在为一场戏苦恼，就是达吉听到生父来了要接她走，要离开少数民族那位义父的时候，义父和女儿二人都痛哭了，这是不是宣扬“人性论”？我肯定了家乙导演的处理。而后影片在１９６１年全国故事片创作会议上放映，家乙的一个发言引起了震动。他说他在拍摄这部影片的时候，始终感到是在人性论的“边缘上跑马，从头到尾直出汗，唯恐坠入修正主义深渊”。
    直到周总理亲自看了小说和电影，才充分肯定了这部影片。总理还说，他看到达吉和她义父痛哭的那场戏，他的眼泪都快流出来了，可是导演不敢让人哭，让演员用两手蒙着脸……
    这次会议后，家乙找我谈了一次心，说自从反右派、反右倾运动之后，他看到长影一批批创作人员倒下去——分别受到批判、斗争、开除、劝告退党的处分的有四十多人，十分痛苦。他还热泪盈眶地叙述了自己被批判为“阶级异己分子”的心情。最后他沉痛地讲了一段话，他认为自己一直是听党的话的，可是他心里产生了怀疑：“延安整风后期搞‘抢救’运动扩大之后，毛主席讲过，如果那么多的党员、知识分子都成了特务，只能说明是我们党失败了。那么，这些年来长影许多党内的干部都倒下去了，可不可以说，我们党的知识分子政策失败了呢？”
    当时，我还不能够、也不敢回答这个大胆的疑问。更没有想到１９６２年８月间，在吉林省委召集长影主要党员干部座谈会上，家乙的发言居然把这个大胆的疑问提出来了，记录在案，在劫难逃，到了“文革”期间，当然成了一个骇人听闻，“胆大包天的诬蔑领袖的反党言论”！
    大概我们两个人都还有点知识分子的良心，形成了一个默契，没有互相揭发这个议论。
    回忆这一段往事，真不免感慨万千。２０多年前的这一段荒诞的历史终于过去了，家乙现在也悄悄走了。听说他在走前昏迷之中还喃喃自语，要回长影拍影片。
    他参加演出和导演的影片《桥》、《风筝》、《五朵金花》、《金玉姬》、《达吉和她的父亲》、《小字辈》等，不仅是长影，也是建国以来全国的优秀影片，这才是他真正的历史面目。
    倘若他能真正抛弃了在刀刃上跑马，生怕掉进人性论、修正主义万丈深渊的顾虑，倘若他不经过“文革”这场灾难，以家乙的才能和表现新事物的热情，难道他不能给我们留下更多真挚感人的诗篇么？
    在感慨万千之中，我还想趁此机会说几句真心话：
    第一，我希望那些老是责备别人而自以为始终正确的人，面对这些走了的人们的经历和作品，想想自己给人民留下了什么！
    第二，我也希望年轻一代的电影工作者多想想老一辈电影艺术家的坎坷经历，想想自己面对改革开放，面对１０亿人民，有前所未有的创作自由，要给人民留下些什么！
    艺术终究是艺术，而不是什么“玩意儿”。“玩”艺术的人不能成为真正的艺术家，也不可能真正给历史写下感人的诗篇。
    家乙同志走前念念不忘拍摄的影片，究竟是什么呢？他又给我留下一个疑问。但我肯定，他恋恋不舍的是真正的艺术，而绝不会是庸俗的商品！
