Since the beginning of the new era, the flourishing of literary and artistic creation in our country has been evident to all. However, it is also undeniable that true masterpieces are few and far between. Logically, after experiencing numerous hardships and enduring excruciating pain over the past decades, and now living in a relatively relaxed environment, this should be an era capable of producing great works. The people have long been eagerly awaiting them. Yet, their hopes have been repeatedly dashed. What is the reason behind this? The causes are naturally not singular and deserve exploration and contemplation by all of us, especially by writers.

Lao She often said during his lifetime that he was not a writer but a scribbler, which was of course his humble words. The world recognizes him as an outstanding great writer of our era. Then, what is the difference between a writer and a scribbler? Can we say: as a scribbler, one only needs to have life experiences and talent. With these two, he can write what he wants to write. As a writer, having life experiences and talent alone is not enough. In addition, one must have a vast heart. A heart as vast as Lu Xun's, who said, "My thoughts are vast and boundless like the universe"; a heart that is sensitive, capable of enduring immense suffering, yet steadfast and unyielding, willing to sacrifice everything for the people and the future of the nation. A foreign writer once said: "A talented writer writes what he can, a great writer writes what he must." The reason he must write is because he is driven by his inner emotions, and if he does not write, his heart will not find peace. Everyone has emotions, but they vary in depth and intensity. There are superficial emotions that are easily stirred, and there are profound emotions that pierce the heart and reach the core of one's life. True great works express emotions that come from the deepest part of the soul. As Sima Qian said, "The Book of Songs, for the most part, is the work of sages expressing their indignation." It is precisely because of indignation, injustice, pain, and pursuit that, when expressed in writing, the work's power to move people is particularly profound. Our writers seem to lack this kind of indignant emotion and the sense of deep, urgent pain in the face of the people's and the nation's tribulations.

In the past, we only emphasized reflecting reality, and writers devoted themselves to depicting and reproducing real life. Their works often lacked lofty ideas and profound emotions, resulting in a lopsided creation. But today, writers seem to have gone to the other extreme. Some works are written in a very mystical way, with characters that do not seem to live on the same land as us, and events that are strange and bizarre, making them hard to comprehend. Some works are not without poetry and philosophy, but this so-called poetry and philosophy are not derived from the life reflected in the work, nor are they integrated into the system of images. They only make people feel bored and confused. Creation should not be a simple reflection and reproduction of reality. It cannot lack imagination, fiction, and creation. Works should contain something that transcends reality. But this transcendence must come from the womb of real life and cannot be an empty castle in the air. Creation has various schools, and writers can adhere to this or that ideology; use this or that method. But these schools, ideologies, and methods are not arbitrarily conceived by anyone. They are born from the intersection of tradition and reality, from concrete life experiences, feelings, and the desire to change this reality. Therefore, they are not something that can be casually borrowed or applied as a trendy thing. All good works, all works with existence value and loved by people, regardless of the ideology they advocate or the methods they use, have their roots in real life. Even if the author disdains reality and shouts about transcending it, his attitude of disdaining reality is precisely derived from real life. And readers, it is precisely because they can see this influence in his work, see his attitude of love and hatred towards real life, see the ideals and wishes he holds, that they find the work understandable and approachable. Therefore, writers and their works, no matter what, cannot escape the influence of real life, just as the Monkey King cannot jump out of the Buddha's palm. Since this is the case, there is no need to intentionally escape it. Instead, one should seriously observe and think deeply about it. Only on this basis can works with true emotions and profound insights be produced, and only then can they have the power to move people's hearts.

What makes me happy is that in recent years, many new talents have emerged, injecting new blood into our creative team and bringing new vitality. Whether in creative themes, thoughts, or techniques, they have made new breakthroughs and creations. But along with the happiness, there is also a bit of regret and worry. These new writers seem to write in a hurry, without careful polishing and refinement. Their works seem to be semi-finished products when they are published. There are also many young writers who seem to think that literary creation is not a difficult and meaningful career. They think that they only need to rely on their talent and write freely. There is even talk of "playing" with literature. And society seems to not know how to properly cherish them. After a work succeeds, they are applauded and demanded to produce more works. This makes them forget and have no time to further cultivate and train themselves, which may make them become fleeting stars. If that happens, it will be a huge loss for us! To achieve success in literary creation, one must truly love it, be dedicated to it with all one's heart and soul, and concentrate one's mind on it. Only under such circumstances can great works be produced.

To satisfy the people's urgent hope to see more masterpieces as soon as possible, we need to make various efforts and need the cooperation of the government, society, the Writers' Association, and other parties. In addition to continuing to care for the writers' lives, reforming the manuscript fee system, and further relaxing the creative environment, I hope that the China Writers' Association and its local branches should pay more attention to the artistic quality of works in their publications. They should be strict in selecting manuscripts, thereby encouraging writers to set higher standards for themselves. In this way, true masterpieces will continuously appear and increase. I believe that with everyone's efforts, the people's wish to see more masterpieces will be realized sooner.

### 希望看到更多的力作

　　希望看到更多的力作
    钱谷融
    新时期以来，我国文艺创作的繁荣是有目共睹的。但也不容讳言，真正的力作并不多。按理说，过去多少年来，我们历经磨难，遭受过撕肝裂肺的痛苦；而今天又处在一个比较宽松的环境下，应该是一个可以产生伟大作品的时代。人民早就在热切地期待着。然而他们的希望却一再落空。这是什么道理呢？原因自然不会是单一的，值得我们大家、特别是作家们去探索、思考。
    老舍先生生前总是说自己不是作家，而是写家，这当然是他的自谦之词。举世公认，他是我们这个时代的一位杰出的大作家。那么，作家与写家的区别在哪里呢？是不是可以这样说：作为一个写家，他只要有生活、有才能就行。有了这两样，他就能写出他所想写的作品来。作为一个作家，单有生活与才能还是不行。除此之外，还要有一颗博大的心灵。一颗能像鲁迅先生那样“心事浩茫连广宇”的博大的心灵；一颗易感的、能承受巨大的苦难、而又坚韧不拔、为了人民和祖国的前途不惜奉献一切的博大的心灵。不记得哪一位外国作家曾说过：“有才能的作家写他所能够写的，伟大的作家则写他所不得不写的。”其所以不得不写，乃是因为受了他内心感情的驱使，不写出来他的一颗心就不得宁静。感情是谁都有的，但有深浅厚薄之分。既有小触小动的浮泛之情，也有痛彻心肺、直入生命根底的至性至情。真正的伟大作品所表现的，都是发自灵魂最深处的至性至情。司马迁所谓“诗三百篇，大抵圣贤发愤之所为作也。”正因为有愤怒，有不平，有痛苦，有追求，发而为文章，其感人之力也就特别深切。我们的作家似乎还缺少这样一种发愤之情，还缺乏一种在人民和祖国的忧患面前寝食难安的沉痛、紧迫之感。
    过去，我们只强调反映现实，作家们一味致力于对现实生活的模写和再现，作品往往缺乏高远的思理和情致，造成了创作上的偏颇。可今天，作家们似乎又走向了另一个极端。一些作品写得很玄虚，里面的人物不像是与我们生活在同一片土地上，所写的事件也离奇怪诞，令人难以捉摸。有些作品似乎也不乏诗意，甚至颇富哲理，但这种所谓的诗意和哲理，并不是从作品所反映的生活中来的，也完全游离在形象体系之外，只能使人感到乏味和不知所云。创作当然不应只是现实生活的简单的反映和再现，它不能没有想象、虚构和创造，作品总应该包含一些高出于现实的东西。但这种高出于现实的东西，又必须是从现实生活的母胎中来的，而不能是凭空臆造的空中楼阁。创作有各种流派，作家可以信奉这种主义，那种主义；采用这种手法，那种手法。但这些流派、主义、手法，都不是哪一个人随便空想出来的。它们都是从传统与现实的交汇中，从对具体生活体验、感受以及希望改变这种现实生活的愿望中孕育、诞生出来的。因而它们并不是一种可以被当作什么时髦的东西，去随便搬来，随便套用的。一切好作品，一切有存在价值、为人所喜爱的作品，不管它标榜什么主义，运用什么手法，都在现实生活中有它的根子。即使它的作者对现实生活不屑一顾，高喊着要超脱现实，可他的这种蔑弃现实的态度，却正是从现实生活中来的。而读者呢，也正是因为从他的作品中可以看到这种影响，看到他对现实生活的爱憎态度，看到他所抱有的理想和愿望等等，才觉得这作品是可以理解、可以亲近的。所以，作家和他的作品，无论如何总是摆脱不掉现实生活的影响，就如孙悟空总归跳不出如来佛的手掌一样。既然如此，就大可不必有意地要去逃避它，倒不如认真地去对它进行深入的观察和严肃的思考，只有在这样的基础上所产生的作品，才能具有真情实感和真知灼见，才能产生激动人心的力量。
    使我高兴的是，这几年来涌现出了许多文坛新秀，为我们的创作队伍注进了新的血液，带来了许多新的气象。无论在创作题材、思想和技巧方面，他们都有新的开拓，新的创造。但在高兴之余，同时也不免有一点遗憾和担忧。这些新进作家似乎写得很匆忙，来不及仔细推敲和琢磨，在他们的作品看来还只是件半成品时，就被拿出来问世了。还有不少青年作家似乎以为文学创作并不是什么艰难的、意义重大的事业，以为只需凭自己的才气，随意挥洒就成。甚至有“玩”文学的说法。而社会似乎并不知道应该怎样好好地去爱护他们，一篇作品成功以后，就拚命地向他们喝采，并争着向他们索要更多的作品。使他们忘记了、也根本没有时间去进一步认真地培养和锻炼自己，这样就很可能使他们成为昙花一现的人物。果真如此的话，对于我们将是何等巨大的损失！要想在文学事业上有所成就，必须对之有真正的爱，肯为它尽心竭力专精致诚，潜志凝神，把整个身心都扑上去。好作品也只有在这样的情形下才会产生。
    为了满足人民群众希望能早日看到更多力作问世的迫切心情，需要我们做种种努力，并需要有政府、社会、作协等各方面的配合。除了还需关心作家生活，改革稿费制度，创作环境进一步宽松等等以外，我希望中国作家协会和各地的分会，应该在自己主办的刊物上更加重视作品的艺术质量，对来稿的选择要严，从而促使作家们对自己提出更高的要求。这样，真正的力作才会不断出现，并将日益增多。我相信在大家的努力下，群众希望看到能有更多力作问世的愿望，一定会早日得到实现的。
