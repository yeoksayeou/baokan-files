The energy base of Cottbus, located in the southeastern part of the German Democratic Republic (GDR), is the largest in the country. Thirty-eight percent of the GDR's primary resource—brown coal—is found in this region.

When the reporter arrived, it had just snowed a few days earlier. The melting snow made the air exceptionally fresh. Although it was mid-winter, green could still be seen in the fields, showing signs of vigorous life.

To understand the development and changes in Cottbus, let's briefly review its history. Before the war, the Cottbus area, despite its rich brown coal reserves, was not a developed region. Its rapid development began after the establishment of the GDR. In the early 1950s, the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, driven by the urgent needs of socialist construction, proposed the task of building the GDR's own energy base here. Thus, the small town of Cottbus became the capital of the region that bears its name. In 1952, the world's first brown coal coking plant was established in this region. In April 1954, then-chairman of the Free German Youth League, Erich Honecker, and the Minister of Heavy Industry signed an agreement to build a large-scale brown coal power plant with a capacity of 450,000 kilowatts, with youth as the main force. Over 2,000 young people from all over the country came here to participate in the construction. That autumn, due to continuous heavy rain, the Spree River flooded, and the youth guarded the embankments day and night to prevent the floodwaters from entering the construction site. After countless unforgettable days and nights, the first steam turbine generator was successfully tested by the end of the year. To this day, people in Cottbus still recall the hardships of those early days with great emotion.

Today, the Cottbus region alone has seven large-scale combined enterprises under central leadership, such as the "Black Pump" gas combined enterprise, the Senftenberg brown coal combined enterprise, and the Jänschwalde brown coal power combined enterprise, all of which are quite large in scale. According to 1987 statistics, the region's brown coal production accounted for 58.9% of the national total, electricity generation accounted for 54.4% of the national total, and the supply of city gas accounted for 82.1% of the national total. All of the GDR's coke is produced in this region. From these figures, one can see the important position that the Cottbus region holds in the GDR's industry and overall national economy.

In the Jänschwalde open-pit coal mine, a steel giant of a 12,000-ton conveyor bridge is continuously transporting brown coal, mined by the excavators, to the other end of the coal field. This massive structure is produced by the GDR itself and is entirely controlled by computers. The vast coal field has very few people visible.

In the past, after the coal layers were mined, the land often lay barren. Now this problem has been solved. After the coal layers are mined, the land is reclaimed for agricultural and forestry development. It is reported that since 1981, 2,300 hectares have been reclaimed.

The GDR government has decided to develop electricity production according to local conditions, building power plants near brown coal mines. Brown coal does not need to be transported far; it is converted into electrical energy at its source and then sent to the rest of the country. The general manager of the brown coal power combined enterprise introduced that the six generating units of the Jänschwalde power plant alone now produce as much electricity as all the power plants in the GDR combined at the time of its founding.

The reporter visited this power plant and saw about a dozen giant cooling towers standing tall, with high chimneys emitting white steam into the blue sky, forming clouds, a magnificent sight. Upon closer inspection, each cooling tower has a large pool underneath, where carp and trout are swimming. These pools have become "warm-water swimming pools" for the fish, and they spend the winter here. When spring comes and the weather warms up, the fish are released into nearby ponds. The power plant has a fish farm attached, and this kind of comprehensive utilization and diversified operation is an ingenious idea. It is said that this is the largest inland fish farm in the GDR.

With the development of the energy industry, the urban landscape of the Cottbus region has also undergone dramatic changes. For example, the small town of Hoyerswerda, which had only a few thousand people in the 1950s, has now developed into the region's second-largest city with a population of 70,000. Whether in the capital of Cottbus or in other cities, one can see large areas of new buildings everywhere. The region invests 1.5 billion marks annually in housing construction. Now, three-quarters of the residents of Cottbus have moved into new homes.

The region's cultural life is also rich and colorful. The grand theater in Cottbus is adorned with many exquisite sculptures and its facilities are not inferior to those in Berlin. Last summer, the Song and Dance Ensemble of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army visited the GDR and performed specially in Cottbus, leaving a beautiful impression on the people of Cottbus. The "Home of Miners and Energy Workers" in Hoyerswerda is funded and built by the combined enterprise and was completed in 1984. It has now become the cultural center of the city. The female manager, Barbara Klaus, introduced that there are 1,100 performances held here every year, with 285,000 spectators. The Berlin State Orchestra and some foreign art troupes have performed here. The main audience is miners and energy workers. But workers are not just spectators; they also have their own amateur art troupes that often perform here. They are also willing to take the lead on stage.

Of course, in the grand stage of social life in the Cottbus region, workers are the main actors.

　　能源基地科特布斯掠影
    本报记者  许宏治
    位于民主德国东南部的科特布斯专区，是民主德国最大的能源基地。民主德国的主要资源——褐煤，有百分之三十八蕴藏在这个专区。
    记者来到这里时，几天前刚下过一场雪。积雪初融，空气格外清新。虽然时值隆冬，地里仍常见绿色，显出勃勃生机。
    要了解科特布斯的发展和变化，不妨先回顾一下历史。在战前的德国，科特布斯一带虽然蕴藏着丰富的褐煤，却并不是一个发达的地区。它的迅速发展是民主德国成立以后的事。五十年代初，德国统一社会党从社会主义建设的迫切需要出发，提出了在这里建设民德自己的能源基地的任务。于是，科特布斯这个普通的小城，成了与它同名的专区的首府。一九五二年在这个专区建立了世界上第一个褐煤炼焦厂。一九五四年四月，当时任自由德国青年联盟中央主席的昂纳克和重工业部部长签订协议，决定以青年为主力，在这里建设一座装机容量为四十五万千瓦的大型褐煤发电厂。全国各地的二千多名青年来到这里参加建设。当年秋天，由于连降大雨，斯普雷河洪水泛滥，青年们日夜守护着堤岸，不让洪水侵入工地。经过多少个难忘的日日夜夜，终于如期于年底前使第一台汽轮发电机试车成功。直到现在，科特布斯人回忆起当年艰苦创业的情景，仍然心潮难平。
    现在的科特布斯专区，仅中央领导的大型联合企业就有七家，如“黑泵”煤气联合企业、森夫滕贝格褐煤联合企业、耶恩施瓦尔德褐煤发电联合企业等，都有相当的规模。据一九八七年统计数字，科特布斯专区的褐煤产量占全国总产量的百分之五十八点九，发电量占全国的百分之五十四点四，供应城市的煤气产量占全国百分之八十二点一，民德的焦炭全部产自这个专区。从这些数字，人们不难看出科特布斯专区在民主德国的工业及整个国民经济中所占的重要地位。
    在耶恩施瓦尔德的露天煤矿，一座钢铁巨龙般的一万二千吨传送桥正在把采煤机掘出的褐煤源源不断地输送到煤田的另一端。这个庞然大物是民德自己生产的，完全由电子计算机控制。偌大的煤田看不到几个人。
    过去，煤田挖尽后土地往往荒废。现在这个问题得到了解决，煤层挖尽后予以复垦，用于发展农业和林业。据介绍，从一九八一年以来，已复垦二千三百公顷。
    民主德国政府决定了因地制宜发展电力生产的方针，在褐煤产地就近建发电厂。褐煤无须远运，就在它的产地转化成了电能，向全国输送。褐煤发电联合企业总经理介绍说，现在仅耶恩施瓦尔德发电厂的六台发电机组的发电量，就相当于民德建国初期全国所有电厂发电量的总和。
    记者在这家发电厂看到，十来个巨大的冷却塔巍然耸立，高大的烟囱正把白色的水蒸汽吐向蓝天，变成了朵朵白云，蔚为壮观。到跟前一看，每个冷却塔下都有一个大水池，水池里鲤鱼、鳟鱼活蹦乱跳。这些水池变成了鱼的“温水游泳池”，它们就在这里过冬。到冬去春来，天气转暖，再把它们放到附近的鱼塘里去。发电厂附设养鱼场，这样的综合利用，多种经营，不知是谁想出来的高招。据说，这是民德最大的一个内陆养鱼场。
    随着能源工业的发展，科特布斯专区的城市面貌也发生了日新月异的变化。如五十年代只有几千人口的小镇霍耶斯维达，现已发展为专区第二大城市，有七万人口。无论在首府科特布斯还是其他城市，到处都可以看到成片的新建筑。专区每年投资十五亿马克，用于住房建设。现在，科特布斯市已有四分之三居民迁入新居。
    专区的文化生活也是丰富多彩的。科特布斯市富丽堂皇的剧院，内有许多精美的雕塑，设备不亚于柏林的剧院。去年夏天，中国人民解放军总政歌舞团访问民德，曾专程来科特布斯，在这所剧院里演出，给科特布斯人留下了美好的印象。霍耶斯维达的“矿工、能源工人之家”是由联合企业投资兴建的，于一九八四年落成，现已成为该市文化生活的中心。女经理巴巴拉·克劳斯介绍说，这里每年要举行一千一百场演出，观众达二十八点五万人次。柏林的国家乐团以及一些外国艺术团体都曾来这里演出。观众主要是矿工和能源工人。但工人们不仅当观众，他们也有自己的业余文艺团体，经常在这里演出。他们也愿意在舞台上当当主角。
    当然，在科特布斯专区社会生活的大舞台上，工人本来就是主角。
