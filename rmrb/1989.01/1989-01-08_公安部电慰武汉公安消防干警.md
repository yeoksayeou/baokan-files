The Ministry of Public Security sent a telegram today to the public security departments of Hubei Province and Wuhan City, expressing deep sorrow for the public security and fire fighters who sacrificed their lives in the battle to extinguish the fire on the oil barge on the Yangtze River, and extending warm regards to all the participants in the battle and the families of the fallen and injured comrades.

The Ministry of Public Security's telegram stated that the Wuhan City Public Security Fire Brigade's high sense of responsibility for national property and revolutionary heroic spirit are worthy of learning by public security personnel.

The telegram praised the Wuhan City Fire Brigade for bravely boarding the ship to fight the fire under extremely difficult conditions without water-based firefighting equipment. Unfortunately, the oil ship exploded, and the firefighters fulfilled their honorable duty with their blood and lives, making their greatest efforts to rescue national property and safeguard the security of Wuhan City.
