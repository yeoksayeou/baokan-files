Xinhua News Agency, January 18th. According to relevant departments of the Air Force Headquarters, the People's Air Force in 1988 dispatched 11,400 aircraft sorties, airlifted over 400,000 personnel, and transported over 3,000 tons of cargo. These efforts made significant contributions to revitalizing the national economy and supporting the people in combating natural disasters.

Last year, after the earthquake in Lincang and Gongma, Yunnan, the Air Force dispatched 11 aircraft of six different types from Kunming, Chengdu, Beijing, Hubei, and Henan to participate in the disaster relief. The personnel overcame numerous difficulties in complex terrain, congested air routes, and challenging flight conditions. They opened 12 air routes from various locations to the disaster area, conducting relay transportation and air drops. In one month, they flew over 400 sorties, transported nearly 1,000 disaster relief personnel, airlifted 398 tons of relief supplies, deployed over 2,800 vehicles, and sent more than 1,900 relief personnel to conduct ground rescue and transportation. This ensured the smooth progress of the earthquake relief efforts. The Yunnan Provincial Party Committee and Government presented the Air Force with a banner inscribed with "Anti-Earthquake Relief for the Country and the People."

The Air Force's transport aircraft units also dispatched numerous aircraft to participate in drought and flood relief, forest fire fighting in Henan, and rescue operations for major accidents such as the Ilyushin-18 crash and the derailment of Train 80. They flew over 500,000 acres of aerial reforestation in more than 10 provinces and autonomous regions, including Guangdong, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Gansu.

It is reported that in August and September last year, Bangladesh suffered a major flood. At the request of the Bangladesh government, the State Council and the Central Military Commission ordered the Air Force to dispatch a flight detachment to Bangladesh for disaster relief. They demonstrated the spirit of enduring hardships and persevering in the face of adversity, overcoming difficulties, flying for 46 days, 398 sorties, covering 64,000 kilometers, and airlifting over 300 tons of supplies. They were praised by the Bangladesh government and people.

    蓝天雄鹰为国为民劳苦功高
    本报讯  新华社记者孙茂庆报道：据空军司令部有关部门介绍，人民空军１９８８年出动飞机１１４００余架次，空运人员４０余万人次，货物３０００多万吨，为振兴国家经济和支援群众抗御自然灾害作出了重要贡献。
    去年，云南澜沧耿马地震发生后，空军先后从昆明、成都、北京、湖北、河南等地抽调了１１架６种型号的飞机投入抗震救灾。指战员们在地形复杂、航线拥挤、飞行难度大的情况下，克服重重困难，开辟了１２条从各地通往灾区的航线，进行接力运输和空投。一个月里，他们共飞行４００多架次，运送救灾人员近千人，空运救灾物资３９８吨，出动各种机动车辆２８００多台，派出救灾人员１９００多人，进行地面抢险运输，保证了群众抗震救灾的顺利进行。云南省委、省政府向空军部队赠送了一面绣着“抗震救灾为国为民”的锦旗。
    空军各运输机部队还派出大批飞机参加了全国各地的旱涝救灾、河南森林灭火，以及伊尔—１８空难、８０次列车颠覆等重大事故的救援。为我国广东、湖北、江西、甘肃等１０多个省区飞播造林５００余万亩。
    据悉，去年８、９月间，孟加拉遭受特大水灾，应孟政府的要求，国务院、中央军委命令空军派出飞行分队赴孟救灾。他们发扬我军吃大苦耐大劳的精神，克服困难，共飞行４６个飞行日，３９８架次，航程６４０００公里，空运物资３００余吨，受到孟加拉政府和人民的赞誉。
