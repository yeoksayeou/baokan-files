Looking up characters in a large dictionary can be a tedious task. Yan Shaoxian, the director of the Publicity Department of the Guangxi branch of the Jiusan Society, has invented a "Stroke Start and End Numbering Method for Character Lookup" that allows for faster and more accurate character searches.

This method uses the numbers 1 through 7 to represent all the strokes in Chinese characters. Whether the characters are traditional or simplified, they are coded according to their starting and ending strokes. This method is simple to learn and quick and accurate to use. Yan Shaoxian used the 1979 revised edition of the "New Chinese Dictionary" published by the Commercial Press as a reference, coding all the more than ten thousand characters in the dictionary with stroke start and end numbers. He compiled a character lookup table for quick reference. This manuscript has been published by the Guangxi Nationalities Publishing House.

    本报讯  查阅大部头字典也是件烦人的事。九三学社广西委员会宣传部部长严少先发明的一种“起收笔查字法”，能更快、更准地帮您查汉字。
    这种方法是用１—７七个阿拉伯数字代表汉字所有笔画，无论繁体和简体字，都按其起收笔代号编码后进行查阅，简便易学，迅速准确。严少先以《新华字典》（商务印书馆１９７９年修订本）为蓝本，将其全部汉字万余个用起收笔代号编码，集编检字表，备查阅该字典用。此稿本已由广西民族出版社出版。
