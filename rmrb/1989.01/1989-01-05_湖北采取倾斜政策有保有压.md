Hubei Implements Tilted Policies with Both Support and Control

    Hubei Province is using the opportunity of rectifying the economic environment and order to adjust and optimize its product structure. In the new year's plan, it will focus on 300 key enterprises and 280 key products, while taking firm measures to limit or prohibit the production of more than 30 types of products.

    The enterprises and products that Hubei Province will ensure this year include a number of key large and medium-sized enterprises that are crucial to the development of the national economy, major tax-paying enterprises, agricultural support products, export-earning products, as well as daily necessities for people's lives. These optimized products are expected to account for more than 70% of the province's industrial output value this year.

    Hubei Province's arrangement reflects a tilted policy of supporting the strong and limiting the weak. In key areas such as energy, raw materials, working capital, and transportation, it will ensure support for key enterprises and select the best for assistance. For products that have been repeatedly banned in the past, such as high-energy-consuming, low-efficiency small silicon iron, small calcium carbide, small cotton spinning, and small beer, production will be firmly stopped or limited.

    For the designated key enterprises and key products, Hubei Province will implement responsibility and organization by region and department, and conduct inspections and assessments. Among them, 125 products and 42 enterprises will be directly scheduled by the provincial economic commission. The production of some seasonal and festive commodities will be scheduled as key items.

　　湖北采取倾斜政策有保有压
    本报讯  记者龚达发报道：湖北省以治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序为契机，调整优化产品结构，在新的一年计划安排三百个重点企业和二百八十项重点产品，同时采取坚决措施限止和禁止三十多种产品生产。
    湖北省今年确保的企业和产品，包括关系国民经济发展的一批大中型骨干企业、财政收入大户、支农产品、出口创汇产品，以及人民生活必需的日用工业品小商品。这些通过优化后的产品，今年所创产值将占全省工业产值的百分之七十以上。
    湖北省这一安排体现了倾斜政策，扶优限劣。在能源、原材料、流动资金、交通运输等“卡脖子”环节，保证重点，择优扶持。对以往屡禁不止的高能耗、低效益的小硅铁、小电石、小棉纺、小啤酒等三十多种产品，坚决停产或限产。
    对于确定的重点企业、重点产品，湖北省实行按地区、按部门分工负责、组织调度，进行检查考核。其中有一百二十五项产品、四十二家企业由省经委直接调度，部分季节性、节令性商品的生产，分别进行重点调度。
