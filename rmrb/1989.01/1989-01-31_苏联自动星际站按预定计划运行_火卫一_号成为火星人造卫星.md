Soviet Automatic Interplanetary Station Operating as Planned
“Phobos 1” Becomes Mars Artificial Satellite

	New China News Agency, Moscow, January 29 (Wang Nan Zhi) The Soviet automatic interplanetary station “Phobos 1” today at 15:55 Moscow time entered the first transitional elliptical orbit of Mars artificial satellite as planned, becoming an artificial satellite of Mars.

	“Phobos 1” was launched on July 12 last year. By today, it has traveled over 470 million kilometers and has communicated with the ground 186 times. Its mission is to investigate Mars, Mars' nearby satellite Phobos, the Sun, and interstellar space.

	Due to the lack of accurate understanding of Phobos and its orbit, the investigation of Mars will be carried out in several steps. Today, the “Phobos 1” automatic station entering the transitional orbit of Mars artificial satellite is the first step; then this automatic station will transition to a circular equatorial orbit about 300 kilometers above Phobos; by the end of March, it will enter the synchronous orbit of Phobos. In early April, this interplanetary station will further approach Phobos and release two probes to the surface of Phobos, one of which is a fixed automatic station for investigation and television imaging, and the other is a device capable of jumping on the surface of Phobos, which will provide data from various points on Phobos, thus providing necessary data for future astronauts to investigate Mars on the ground.

	To investigate Mars, the Soviet Union launched two automatic interplanetary stations, “Phobos 1” and “Phobos 2,” in July 1988. In early September last year, due to an operator's incorrect command, “Phobos 1” lost contact with the ground and became an artificial satellite of the Sun. “Phobos 1” is the “Phobos 2” automatic interplanetary station launched in July last year.

### 苏联自动星际站按预定计划运行  “火卫一”号成为火星人造卫星

　　苏联自动星际站按预定计划运行
    “火卫一”号成为火星人造卫星
    新华社莫斯科１月２９日电（王南枝）苏联自动星际站“火卫一”号于今天莫斯科时间１５时５５分按预定计划进入火星人造卫星的第一条过渡性椭圆形轨道，成为火星的人造卫星。
    “火卫一”号星际站是去年７月１２日发射的。至今天为止，飞行距离超过４．７亿公里，同地面进行了１８６次通信联络。它的使命是考察火星及离火星较近的火星的卫星——火卫一、太阳及星际空间。
    鉴于对火卫一及其运行轨道缺少准确的概念，对火星的考察要分几步走，今天“火卫一”号自动站进入火星人造卫星过渡性轨道是第一步；然后这个自动站将过渡到离火卫一近３００公里上空的圆形赤道轨道；３月底再进入火卫一同步轨道。４月初这个星际站将进一步靠近火卫一，同时向火卫一表面施放２个探测器，其中一个是进行考察和电视摄像的固定自动站，另一个是能在火卫一表面作跳跃式行进的装置，它将提供火卫一各个点的资料，从而为将来宇航员实地考察火星提供必要的数据。
    为考察火星，苏联在１９８８年７月发射了两个自动星际站“火卫——１”号和“火卫——２”号。去年９月初由于操作员发错指令，“火卫——１”号与地面失去了联系，成了太阳的人造卫星。“火卫一”号就是去年７月发射的“火卫——２”号自动星际站。
