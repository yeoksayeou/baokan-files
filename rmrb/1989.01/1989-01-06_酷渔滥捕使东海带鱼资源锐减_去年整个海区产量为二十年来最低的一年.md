Overfishing has led to a sharp decline in the cod stocks in the East China Sea. Last year, the entire fishing area saw the lowest production in 20 years.

According to a report, due to the blind expansion of fishing vessels and overfishing in recent years, the cod resources in China's seas, which have the highest production, have rapidly declined. The East China Sea Fisheries Command reported that during the winter fishing season for cod (November 1, 1988, to December 10, 1988), the catch from more than 24,000 fishing vessels in Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Fujian, and Shanghai decreased by 18.8% compared to the same period last year, making it the lowest production year in nearly 20 years.

It is understood that the prominent feature of last winter's cod fishing season was that the center of the Zhoushan fishing ground was not obvious, and the fish were scattered, failing to form a strong fishing season. Although the operating range of fishing vessels expanded and the number of net casts increased, the catch per net was low, and the cod were smaller. The 1,000-plus fishing vessels in the national key fishing area of Zhoushan City saw their average daily catch and catch per net decrease by 19.8% and 24.9%, respectively, compared to last year. Some even experienced consecutive empty nets, which is rare in history.

The main reason for the significant reduction in cod production is that in recent years, coastal areas have blindly built ships and gone to sea, with the growth rate of fishing power far exceeding the regeneration rate of cod resources. Sun Shui Gen, deputy director of the East China Sea Fisheries Administration of the Ministry of Agriculture and a senior engineer, said that in 1978, the East China Sea area had 18,000 various types of motorized fishing vessels in three provinces and one city. Currently, this number has exceeded 70,000. After the General Office of the State Council forwarded the opinions of the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, and Fisheries on the control indicators of near-sea motorized fishing vessels in April 1987, the blind construction of ships and going to sea in various places has not decreased but increased.

Zhejiang Provincial Marine Fisheries Research Institute deputy researcher Zhu Delin and more than 10 fisheries experts analyzed that during last winter's fishing season, the near-sea area of the Zhoushan fishing ground was affected by high-salinity water, resulting in more cod in the offshore area than in the near-sea area. This gave people the illusion that there are cod to be caught in the Zhoushan offshore fishing ground. This year, coastal areas may see a wave of building large fishing vessels. Currently, many fishing areas have begun to raise funds and materials to prepare to build large ships. Even if some effects can be achieved in one or two years, the damage to resources will be more severe.

Experts urge: Coastal governments at all levels should start from the actual situation of fishery resources and gradually bring marine fishery production under scientific management and legal norms. They should not continue to engage in blindly increasing ships and overfishing.

### 酷渔滥捕使东海带鱼资源锐减  去年整个海区产量为二十年来最低的一年

　　酷渔滥捕使东海带鱼资源锐减
    去年整个海区产量为二十年来最低的一年
    本报讯  由于近几年沿海各地盲目增船、酷渔滥捕，我国海域产量最高的带鱼资源急剧下降。据东海区渔业指挥部统计，带鱼冬汛开捕（１９８８年１１月１日到１２月１０日），浙、苏、闽、沪的２．４万多艘渔船捕捞产量比上年同期下降１８．８％，是近２０年来产量最低的一年。
    据了解，去年冬季带鱼汛的明显特点是，整个舟山渔场中心不明显，鱼发分散形不成旺汛，虽然渔船作业范围扩大、投网次数增多，但网产低，带鱼条子偏小。全国重点渔区舟山市的１０００多对渔船，平均日产量和每一网产量分别比去年下降１９．８％和２４．９％，有的甚至连续出现空网，均属历年所罕见。
    造成带鱼大幅度减产的主要原因是，近几年沿海各地盲目造船下海，捕捞力量的增长速度远远超过了带鱼资源的再生速度。农业部东海渔政分局副局长、高级工程师孙水根说，１９７８年，东海区３省１市的各类机动渔船为１．８万艘，目前已突破７万艘。１９８７年４月国务院办公厅转发农牧渔业部《关于近海捕捞机动渔船控制指标的意见》等文件后，各地盲目造船下海仍有增无减。
    浙江省海洋水产研究所副研究员朱德林等１０多位水产专家分析，去年冬汛，舟山渔场近海由于高盐水影响，出现了外海带鱼多于近海的情况，使一些２５０马力以上的大型渔船偶然捕到了较好网头。这给人们造成一种错觉：舟外渔场有带鱼可捕。今年沿海可能要掀起造大型渔船的热潮，目前，已有不少渔区开始筹措资金、物资准备造大船。这样，即使在一二年内能收到一定效果，但对资源的破坏会更严重。
    专家们呼吁：沿海各级政府要从水产资源实际出发，把海洋渔业生产逐步纳入科学管理的轨道和法律规范，不能再干盲目增船、酷渔滥捕的蠢事了。
