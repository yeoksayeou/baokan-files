At present, all college graduates of this year who were admitted according to the state's plan still follow the main allocation system of planned distribution. The state will arrange jobs for all qualified college graduates and graduate students. However, the methods of allocation will be reformed. This was announced by Zhu Kaixuan, Vice Minister of the State Education Commission, at the opening of the 1989 National College Graduates' Supply and Demand Information Exchange Meeting held by the State Education Commission today.

According to the Student Affairs Department of the State Education Commission, this year there are 527,000 college graduates who need state allocation, including 40,000 graduate students. The demand for graduates from society, just from the reported figures, has already exceeded the total number of graduates this year. However, there are several imbalances in supply and demand: first, there is an imbalance in the supply and demand of disciplines and specialties. For example, foreign-related specialties, certain economic specialties, and mechanical manufacturing specialties are in high demand and have a shortage of graduates, while some humanities and sciences have a low demand from society; second, there is an imbalance in the demand from employing units, with large cities and large organizations having a low demand, while grassroots and small units have a high demand; third, there is an imbalance between the supply of graduates and the demand of various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government. For example, Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai have abundant graduates but low demand, while some provinces and autonomous regions have high demand but a shortage of graduates. To do a good job in the allocation of graduates this year, appropriately introduce a competitive mechanism, and to the greatest extent possible meet the society's demand for graduates and the employment requirements of graduates, the State Education Commission has decided to reform the allocation methods for graduates. The methods will involve first conducting a nationwide exchange of information on the supply and demand of graduates. Based on the broad acquisition of demand information, each school will propose a plan for the allocation of graduates according to social needs, and finally, the State Education Commission or other relevant departments will adjust and approve the plan before it is implemented by the schools. This approach combines market demand with planned allocation, changing the previous top-down "block allocation" method of planning. This way, the allocation of graduates will be more in line with actual needs and will also be conducive to the reasonable use of outstanding talents. Holding this information exchange meeting is part of the reform of the allocation methods for graduates.

At today's opening ceremony, Zhu Kaixuan also pointed out: At present, we are in the transitional stage of reforming the allocation system for graduates. Each university should promptly inform graduates of the state's policies, guidelines, and reform measures regarding the allocation of graduates. The transparency of the allocation work should be increased, the allocation plan should be made public to the students, and more dialogue should be conducted with the students to guide their career choices. When employing units come to the school to select graduates, they should send personnel who are knowledgeable in the field, cherish talents, have a good work ethic, and have been trained. They should resist improper practices. He also called for not discriminating against female students and for schools, local personnel, and education departments to take action against clearly unreasonable gender restrictions.

The formal representatives attending this information exchange meeting include personnel from the central ministries and commissions, local planning, personnel, and education departments, direct-affiliated universities of the State Education Commission, and some large enterprises, totaling over 400 people. Additionally, over 600 people from various places came to scout for talents and also participated in the information exchange.

　　高校毕业生分配供需信息交流会透露
    今年高校毕业生有五十多万
    凡合格者国家均负责安排工作
    本报北京１月１６日讯  记者毕全忠报道：现阶段凡按国家任务招收入学的本届高校毕业生仍实行计划分配为主的分配体制，凡合格的大学毕业生和毕业研究生，国家均负责安排工作，但分配的方法将进行改革。这是国家教委副主任朱开轩今天在国家教委举办的１９８９年全国高校毕业生分配供需信息交流会开幕时宣布的。
    据国家教委学生司介绍，今年需要国家分配的高校毕业生共有５２．７万名，其中毕业研究生有４万名。今年社会对毕业生的需求仅从报来的数字看就超过了今年毕业生总数。然而供需还有几个不平衡：一是学科专业供需不平衡，例如涉外专业、某些经济类专业和机械制造等专业需求量大，生源紧俏，而另一些学科专业如某些文科、理科，社会需求量小；二是用人单位需求不平衡，大城市、大机关需求量小，基层、小单位需求量大；三是毕业生生源与各省、自治区、直辖市的需求不平衡，如京、津、沪生源充裕，但需求量较少，而有的省、自治区需求多而生源紧缺。为了做好今年毕业生的分配工作，适当引入竞争机制，最大程度地满足社会对毕业生的需求和毕业生的就业要求，国家教委决定改革毕业生分配的方法，采取先进行全国性的毕业生供需信息交流，各校在广泛获取需求信息的基础上根据社会需求提出毕业生分配计划方案，最后由国家教委或其他主管部委调济、批准后下达各校执行的方法，把市场需求跟计划分配结合起来，改变了过去由上而下“切块”分配的计划编制方法。这样做可以使毕业生的分配更加符合实际需要，也有利于优秀人才的合理使用。举办这次信息交流会就是改革毕业生分配方法的一部分。
    在今天的开幕会上，朱开轩还指出：目前处于毕业生分配制度改革的过渡阶段，各个高校要及时把国家关于毕业生分配工作的方针、政策和改革措施告诉毕业生，要增加分配工作的透明度，分配方案要向学生公布，多与学生对话，指导毕业生择业。用人单位到学校挑选毕业生时，要选派懂专业、爱惜人才、作风正派和经过训练的干部，抵制不正之风。他还呼吁不要歧视女生，对那些明显不合理的性别限制，学校、地方人事及教育部门要出面做工作。
    参加这次信息交流会的正式代表有中央各部委和地方计划、人事、教育部门、国家教委直属高校和一些大企业的人员共４００多人。另有各地来物色人才的人员６００多人也参加了信息交流。
