	What time?
	Liu Congling
	I recall a question you asked me several times, a foolish yet adorable question. You seemed to want me to count my love from the day I was born.
	You asked, "When is it?"
	Love is whenever it is. I can't remember, dear.
	When the sunlight just emerged from the night, when the waves rolled in to kiss the shore, when the wind brushed past the clouds in the sky.
	I stood amidst a cluster of flowers, waving to you, smiling within.
	I saw you running on the beach, a hint of childlike innocence on your lips. You looked up, your black hair dancing in the sea breeze. You were barefoot.
	You asked, "When is it?" You asked this many times. How should I answer you? Let your eyes forever be filled with the gentle blue of the sea, whether the sun is shining brightly or has set!

　　什么时候？
    刘聪玲
    我想起一个你问起好几遍的问题，一个傻得可爱的问题，你仿佛想让我把我的爱从出生的那天算起。
    你问这是什么时候？
    爱在哪一天，就是哪一天。我也记不起了，亲爱的。
    当阳光刚刚从夜里走出来，当海浪漫卷着去吻沙滩，当风拂过天上的白云。
    我站在一丛花中，朝你招手，笑在心里。
    我看见你在沙滩上飞跑，嘴角有一丝孩童天真的笑。你仰起头，一头乌发在海风中飞扬起来。你打着赤脚。
    你问这是什么时候，你问了好多遍。我怎么回答你？让你的眼睛永远充满一片海蓝色的柔情吧，不管太阳灿烂着，还是隐去了！
