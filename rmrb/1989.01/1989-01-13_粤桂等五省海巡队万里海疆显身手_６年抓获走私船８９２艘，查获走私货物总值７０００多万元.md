The maritime patrol teams of Guangdong, Guangxi, and three other provinces have made significant contributions to the fight against smuggling along the vast coastal lines of China. From 1982 to the end of November 1988, the maritime patrol teams of Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Zhejiang, and Hainan provinces jointly seized 892 smuggling vessels and confiscated smuggled goods worth over 72.8 million yuan.

In 1982, to meet the needs of the anti-smuggling campaign in the eastern coastal regions, maintain maritime public order, and safeguard the economic construction of the coastal areas, the public security border defense departments not only strengthened the Guangdong and Guangxi maritime patrol teams but also established maritime patrol teams in Zhejiang, Fujian, and Hainan provinces. These teams took on the responsibility of maintaining maritime public order and combating smuggling on a regular basis.

In the fight against smuggling, the maritime patrol teams enhanced cooperation with customs and other units, strengthened maritime patrols and public security management, understood smuggling trends, gathered intelligence, relied on the masses, and effectively struck at smuggling activities. In June and July of last year, the Guangdong Maritime Police Brigade conducted two operations against maritime smuggling, seizing 27 smuggling vessels and confiscating smuggled goods such as VCRs, color TVs, and cigarettes worth over 4 million yuan.

Over the years, the maritime patrol officers have maintained a long-term combat mindset, strictly enforced policies, and adhered to the law in the arduous and complex maritime anti-smuggling campaign. They resisted bribery and other improper influences, striking at various smuggling activities.

Statistics show that over the past six years, 112 individuals have been awarded for their meritorious service, nearly 2,000 individuals have been commended, and more than 60 units have been recognized as advanced units.

  　粤桂等五省海巡队万里海疆显身手
    ６年抓获走私船８９２艘，查获走私货物总值７０００多万元
    新华社北京１月１１日电  （记者周立宪）长年战斗在万里海防线上的我国公安边防海巡队在反走私斗争中贡献突出。从１９８２年至１９８８年１１月底，广东、广西、福建、浙江、海南５省区海巡队共抓获走私船８９２艘，查获走私货物总价值达７２８０多万元。
    １９８２年，为适应东南沿海反走私斗争的需要，维护海上治安秩序，保卫沿海地区的经济建设，公安边防部门除充实和加强广东、广西两个海巡大队外，还先后组建了浙江、福建、海南３个省的海巡队，承担起经常性的维护海上治安和缉私工作。
    在缉私斗争中，各海巡队加强与海关等单位的协作，加强海上巡逻和治安管理，了解走私动向，掌握走私线索，依靠群众，准确有力地打击走私活动。广东省海警支队去年６月至７月两次对海上走私活动进行打击，查获走私船２７艘，查获走私的录像机、彩电、香烟等物品，价值４００多万元。
    几年来，海巡队干警树立长期作战的思想，在艰苦、复杂的海上反走私斗争中，严格执行政策，遵纪守法，顶住说情、行贿等不正之风，打击了各种走私活动。
    据统计，６年多来，先后有１１２人次立功，近２０００人次受嘉奖，６０多个集体被评为先进单位。
