Public Security, Commerce, and Procuratorate Departments in Hanyin County recently took joint action to crack down on a major case involving the manufacture and sale of 309 tons of counterfeit pesticides.

In April of last year, Sun Zhenrong, a fugitive from Wanhong County in Shanxi Province, learned that pesticides were in short supply in Hanyin County, Shaanxi Province. He then colluded with the deputy director of the "Xinghuo Chemical Factory" in Jianchi Town, Hanyin County, Tang Shuiping, and the accountant Liu Bo, among others. Under the guise of the "Xinghuo Chemical Factory," and without any technical equipment, they heated and dyed sand, mixing 1.5 kilograms of "Furadan" pesticide into every 50 kilograms of sand. They produced 309.5 tons of counterfeit pesticide, which they then passed off as genuine "Furadan" pesticide. They sold it to 60 counties in 12 provinces, including Hebei, Shanxi, Sichuan, and Shaanxi, at prices ranging from 2,200 to 2,800 yuan per ton, illegally profiting 690,000 yuan.

Upon inspection by relevant departments, it was found that the counterfeit pesticides contained only 0.02% "Furadan," with most containing none at all, rendering them ineffective against pests. This caused severe economic losses for the farmers.

The Hanyin County Public Security Bureau, in collaboration with the Commerce and Procuratorate departments, investigated the case based on public reports. They apprehended the suspects Tang Shuiping and Liu Bo. They also seized hundreds of boxes of unsold counterfeit pesticides and confiscated cash and goods worth over 50,000 yuan. The ringleader, Sun Zhenrong, is currently at large and is being pursued.

    汉阴破获一起特大制造销售假农药案
    本报西安１月２７日电  陕西省汉阴县公安、工商、检察等部门最近联合行动，一举破获一起制造销售３０９吨假农药的特大案件。
    去年４月，山西省万荣县流窜人员孙振荣得知陕西汉阴县农药紧张，即伙同汉阴县乡镇企业涧池镇“星火化工厂”副厂长汤水平、出纳员刘波等人，打着“星火化工厂”招牌，在无任何技术设备的情况下，将石沙烘热着色后，每５０公斤石沙仅掺入１．５公斤“呋喃丹”农药，共生产假农药３０９．５吨，然后假冒合格的“呋喃丹”农药，分别以每吨２２００元至２８００元的价格，销售给河北、山西、四川、陕西等１２个省６０多个县，非法牟利６９万元。
    经有关部门鉴定，这批销售的假农药，“呋喃丹”含量仅为０．０２％，其中大部分含量为零，毫无杀虫效果，给农民造成严重经济损失。
    汉阴县公安局根据群众举报，在工商、检察等部门的配合下，查明了这起案件，并将案犯汤水平、刘波抓获归案。同时查封未销售的假农药数百箱，缴获赃款和赃物折款５万余元，主犯孙振荣畏罪潜逃，正在通缉追捕之中。
