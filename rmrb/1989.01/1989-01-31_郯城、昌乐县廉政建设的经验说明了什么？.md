The experience of Liancheng and Changle counties in building a clean government shows what?

I. It is completely possible to govern cleanly, the key is leadership resolve

Over the past few years, some people have regarded corrupt practices and malfeasance as incurable diseases, lacking or even losing confidence in improving party and government conduct. Can we really achieve clean governance? The practices of Liancheng and Changle counties have given a positive answer. Many phenomena that people regard as "cancers," such as the layer-by-layer withholding and high-price resale of agricultural production materials, using power for personal gain, bribery, abuse of power, using public funds for banquets and gifts, excessive eating and drinking, arbitrary fundraising, arbitrary levies, arbitrary deductions, and backdoor dealings in recruitment, employment, and "agricultural to non-agricultural" transfers, which have been the biggest sources of complaints and strongest reflections from the masses, have basically been solved in these counties. As a result, party conduct, government conduct, and public conduct have improved, the image of the party has been elevated, party-mass and cadre-mass relations have been strengthened, and people's enthusiasm has been further boosted. The people of Liancheng County wrote to the county committee saying, "We should sing praises for the Communist Party," "The old Eighth Route Army has returned," "With such a county committee leading the way, there is great hope." Last year, this county completed the summer grain procurement in just 5 days, and the autumn grain procurement was completed in 15 days, making it the first county in the province to complete grain procurement. The fundamental reason is that the county's leading comrades made a decision, started with themselves, and truly tackled and solved problems. To solve the problem of fertilizer supply, the six major departments of Liancheng County took the lead in not issuing vouchers and not taking the back door. County Party Secretary Zhang Chuanlin announced at a county-wide cadre meeting: "Set up a supervision reward. If it is found that I take the back door for one bag of fertilizer, deduct my annual salary, and reward the supervisor 1,000 yuan." The county magistrate demanded of the county fertilizer factory: "The old man's vouchers can be honored, but not one ounce of fertilizer for the farmers can be missing." It is precisely because of such resolve that the long-standing "difficult problem" has been solved. To curb the wind of using public funds for eating and drinking, the county's leading comrades took the lead, and more than 1,500 cadres signed a guarantee letter and made it public, with significant results. In the 9 months after 1987, the entertainment expenses of townships and towns decreased by 63% compared to the same period the previous year, and further decreased last year. This shows that once the leadership makes a decision, even the most difficult problems can be solved, and so-called "incurable diseases" can be cured. Now it seems that it is difficult to rectify party and government conduct, and the difficulty lies in the leadership not making a decision or not making a big decision. As long as a decision is made and it is made firmly, the problem can be solved, which is a fundamental experience. Those pessimistic sentiments that "the big environment doesn't change, the small climate is hard to change" are unacceptable. As long as everyone is like the comrades of Liancheng and Changle counties, making a decision to tackle the problem, clean governance will definitely achieve significant results.

II. Clean governance is the key link to doing a good job in various tasks at present, and it can achieve multiple benefits

At present, we face heavy tasks, especially in rectifying the economic environment, rectifying the economic order, and comprehensively deepening the reform, there are many contradictions and difficulties to be solved. To complete these tasks, it is urgent for party members, cadres, and the masses to work together in unity and strive forward. Whether or not to govern cleanly is the key to solving the "unity," "cooperation," and "joint efforts" of party members, cadres, and the masses. Once this link is grasped, it will eliminate the negative, complaining, and dissatisfied sentiments among the people, achieving the goal of thinking together and working together. Liancheng and Changle counties have grasped clean governance, promoted the improvement of party conduct, government conduct, and public conduct, strengthened party-mass and government-mass relations, promoted stability and unity, and promoted the development of various undertakings. The situation in Changle County before and after grasping clean governance is quite different. Now, the phenomenon of "eating, taking, demanding, and asking" by cadre and staff in rural areas has basically disappeared. County-level cadres going to the countryside insist on one dish and one soup, do not drink alcohol, and do not accompany meals. In the past, Cui Jia Township, which was known as the "five no special zone" of not paying grain, taxes, deductions, not doing voluntary work, and not implementing family planning, has solved several "difficult problems" through administrative transparency, mass supervision, and clean governance. Last year, non-production expenses alone were reduced by more than 80,000 yuan compared to the previous year, equivalent to the two-year salary of the village party branch secretary, village head, and village clerk in the entire township. In the past, it took a whole winter for townships and towns in Changle County to collect deductions, but last year, 22 townships and towns completed the task in just one month. The county's family planning rate reached 98%, an increase of 5.7% compared to 1987; the natural population growth rate dropped from 16‰ to 8‰. Last year, the Liancheng County People's Political Consultative Conference held a meeting, and the delegates did not raise any criticisms about the cleanliness of party and government organs in more than 200 proposals or speeches; the regional committee organized townships and above cadres to evaluate the county committee's leading cadre, and there was not a single vote of no confidence. The Party Committee Secretary of Honghe Town in Changle County said, "Grasping clean governance, rectifying the three winds (party conduct, government conduct, public conduct), dispelling evil, and bringing about six changes, namely, the change in the prestige of party and government, the change in cadre-mass relations, the change in service quality, the change in production development, the change in rural customs, and the change in spiritual civilization." It can be said that once the problem of clean governance is broken through, many tasks will be smooth and effective. On the contrary, if orders are not followed, desires cannot be realized, and many tasks cannot be implemented. Our leading comrades at all levels should have a full understanding of this point.

III. To achieve clean governance, transparency and institutionalization are key

The problem of clean governance in Liancheng and Changle counties has been relatively well solved, not because of any "miracle cure," but because they have taken a new path of relying on transparency and institutional construction, starting from the issues that the masses are most concerned about. In the past, we also emphasized that party members and cadres should be clean and upright, and established supervision and inspection organizations, but we did not find an effective way to prevent corruption under the conditions of a commodity economy. Now, by combining transparency, institutional construction with traditional supervision, inspection, and ideological education, the power has been released. The reason is that in the past, many of our policies, regulations, and measures, although good, were unknown to the masses or known to very few. If the work is not open, the masses cannot supervise, and a few people can take advantage of the opportunity to engage in malpractice. Liancheng and Changle counties have implemented administrative transparency and increased transparency, and everything that can be made public is made public, exposing everything to the sunlight, and evil things lose their hiding place. After Liancheng County set up the "Land Contract Fee Collection Detail Board" and the "Expenditure Detail Board," the problem of arbitrary collection and arbitrary levies was solved, and last year, the per capita levy only accounted for 4.2% of the per capita income. All townships and 95% of villages in Changle County have established mass supervision and deliberation organizations, setting up various public bulletin boards totaling 2,261, creating conditions for the masses to supervise and participate in politics. For example, they distribute scarce agricultural materials to villages according to standards and make it public. Some township cadres secretly misappropriated 200 pounds of subsidized diesel, and some employees withheld 3 bags of subsidized fertilizer from farmers, which were quickly exposed by the masses and the actual items were publicly displayed at the township government gate, giving a profound education to the cadres and staff of the entire county. Obviously, under the watchful eyes of the public, it is not easy for anyone to engage in malpractice, and even if there is, it will be reported and solved in time. Their experience also shows that it is not enough to only make certain administrative affairs public and supervised, often "people in power, people out of power." Only by carrying out comprehensive and coordinated reforms in democratic political construction, making it institutionalized and standardized, can the soil for the breeding of corruption be reduced and even eliminated. Changle County has generally established eight systems: administrative transparency, inspection and supervision, whistleblowing, evaluation and handling, consultation and dialogue, public opinion supervision, democratic appraisal, and people's letters and visits. Some villages have also established the system of people's participation in politics, and all major and difficult matters in the village are first discussed by party members or the villagers' deliberation council and then decided, changing from ex post supervision to ex ante supervision, with better results.

IV. Insist on strict party and government governance

The central government's assessment of the cleanliness of our party and government is completely in line with the reality of Shandong. It should be said that the working style of the vast majority of party and government organs in Shandong is good, and the vast majority of party members and cadres are also good, dedicated to public service and hardworking. However, there are indeed a few party members and cadres, officials, and staff who abuse power, use power for personal gain, embezzle and accept bribes, and harm the interests of the public and the people, causing a very bad influence among the masses, and some problems are becoming more and more serious, and it is time to solve them. To eliminate various corrupt practices, we must insist on strict party and government governance and adopt a comprehensive governance approach. We must combine strengthening the education of the party's purpose with establishing systems, combine self-discipline with serious investigation and handling, and combine rectifying the correct with eliminating the evil. The root cause of the occurrence of malpractice and extravagant corruption is that a few people have forgotten or betrayed the party's purpose of wholeheartedly serving the people, nurturing the extreme individualism of seeking personal gain. To root out this problem, we still need to focus on ideological education. At present, we must emphasize the education of the party's purpose for party members and cadres, further clarify the nature of the party and the government organs, the sacred duties of state workers, and truly solve the problem of who to hold power for, who to work for, and who to serve. Establish the concept of honor for dedicating oneself to the people and shame for using power for personal gain, get rid of the idea of privilege, strengthen the consciousness of public servants, and consciously do their duty, be impartial, not seek personal gain, and thus build a strong dam in the minds of all party members and cadres to resist the invasion of decadent thoughts. Such education must be combined with the establishment of systems. At present, we must focus on establishing good systems of administrative transparency, inspection and supervision, people's participation in politics, whistleblowing, and evaluation and handling. Once the system is established, it must be strictly followed, say what you do, and correct those who violate it. Moreover, to maintain cleanliness, for the vast majority of party members and cadres, it is mainly through education, awareness, and self-discipline. We must vigorously commend the organs, units, and individuals who govern cleanly. At the same time, for the few party members and cadres who violate party discipline, government discipline, and legal discipline, we must seriously investigate and handle them without mercy. Last year, Liancheng County took measures such as ideological mobilization, personal confession, and handwriting comparison to investigate and handle 171 impersonators in recruitment, and all of them were dismissed and handled, winning the praise of the masses and preventing similar problems from happening again. The Liaocheng region seriously handled two cadres who violated regulations to accept banquets, curbing the wind of eating and drinking. In the past few months, the entertainment expenses of the regional government organs have decreased by an average of 53% compared to before the rectification, and the average decrease in various counties and cities is 66%. Practice has proven that only by legally handling the few people with serious problems can the majority be educated, achieving the effect of "strict laws and correct conduct, actions must be regulated."

V. Leading organs must set an example and establish a clean governance responsibility system

Recently, the Shandong Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government have formulated the "Code of Conduct for Clean and Diligent Governance of Provincial Party and Government Cadres," made 12 regulations, and made them public to accept supervision from all levels and departments and the masses. In the future, provincial comrades going to work below will all eat a portion of food and will not be entertained or accompanied by meals, hoping that comrades in all places will do the same. The Provincial Party Committee, the Provincial Government, and the provincial-level units will not ask for items from the grassroots and enterprises, and all places and units will not send gifts to leading organs, departments, and cadres with public funds. This Spring Festival will strictly guard against it as a good start for clean governance. Provincial-level organs will take clean governance as the center and concentrate on carrying out the rectification of the style of work and institutional construction. For this, we plan to organize all cities and regions and departments to conduct a comprehensive democratic appraisal of the work and style of provincial-level organs and departments, and put forward criticisms and suggestions.

This year, party and government organs at all levels in the province should regard clean governance as a particularly important matter. A strict clean governance responsibility system should be established. Party committees and governments and departments at all levels should, according to the division of work in daily work, take responsibility for the clean governance of the places, systems, and units they are responsible for. The heads of party and government organs at all levels should be fully responsible for the clean governance of the party and government "leading group." The Standing Committee of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee has decided that I will be responsible for the clean governance of the Standing Committee, the governor will be responsible for the clean governance of the provincial government leadership, and other secretaries and standing committee members will be responsible for the clean governance of the departments they are in charge of. One level should grasp one level, and one level should lead one level. If it is not done well, it means that the responsibility has not been fulfilled, and if a major problem occurs due to negligence, the responsibility for dereliction of duty should be pursued. The term targets and post responsibility systems of cadres at all levels should highlight clean governance, emphasizing strict adherence to laws and regulations, no corruption, impartial and responsible work, no use of power for personal gain, hard work, and no extravagance and waste. In the future, when evaluating the work of a party committee and government at a level, it will not only be seen whether the economy has developed, but also whether the party and government conduct have been rectified and clean governance has been achieved. When evaluating the performance of a cadre, clean governance will also be an important factor, thereby promoting the clean governance work in our province to be carried out in depth and extensively.

　　郯城、昌乐县廉政建设的经验说明了什么？
    姜春云
    一、为政清廉是完全可以做到的，关键在领导决心
    几年来，有些人把不正之风和腐败现象看成是不治之症，对搞好党风政风缺乏甚至失去信心。到底能否做到廉洁从政？郯城、昌乐县的实践作了肯定的回答。许多被人们视为“癌症”的现象，如农业生产资料层层克扣、高价倒卖，以权谋私、行贿受贿、弄权渎职，用公款请客送礼、大吃大喝，乱集资、乱摊派、乱提留，招工招干、“农转非”走后门等干部群众意见最大、反映最强烈的问题，在他们那里基本上得到了解决。结果，党风、政风、民风变好了，党的形象高大了，党群、干群关系密切了，人们的积极性更加高涨了。郯城县的群众给县委写信说：“要为共产党唱赞歌”，“老八路又回来了”，“有这样的县委领路，大有希望”。去年，这个县夏粮征购只用了５天，秋粮征购也只用了１５天就完成了任务，成为全省第一个首先完成粮食征购任务的县。其根本原因是，县里的领导同志下了决心，从自身做起，真抓真解决问题。郯城县为解决化肥供应中的问题，县六大班子带头不批条子，不走后门。县委书记张传林在全县干部大会上宣布：“设一份监督奖，若是发现我走一袋化肥的后门，扣我一年的工资，奖监督者１０００元。”县长对县化肥厂提出要求：“天老爷的条子可以顶，农民的化肥一两也不能少。”正是有了这样的决心，才解决了多年解决不了的“老大难”问题。为刹住用公款吃喝风，该县领导同志带头，１５００多名干部在保证书上签名，并公诸于众，成效甚大。１９８７年后９个月乡镇招待费就比上年同期下降６３％，去年又进一步下降。这说明，领导决心一下，再难的问题也不难了，所谓“不治之症”也治愈了。现在看，端正党风政风难，难就难在领导不下决心，或者决心下得不大。只要下了决心、狠心，问题就好办了，这是一条带根本性的经验。那些认为“大环境不变，小气候难改”的悲观情绪是要不得的。只要大家都像郯城、昌乐县的同志那样，下决心抓，廉洁从政一定会大见成效。
    二、廉洁从政是搞好当前各项工作的关键环节，可以一举多得
    当前，我们面临的任务很重，特别是治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序、全面深化改革，需要解决的矛盾、困难很多。要完成这些任务，亟需党内外同心协力，团结奋进。而能否为政清廉，又是解决党员、干部、群众“同心”、“团结”、“协力”的钥匙，这一环抓好了，就会消除人们中间的消极、埋怨、不满情绪，做到心往一处想，劲往一处使。郯城和昌乐县正是抓了廉洁从政，促进了党风、政风和民风的好转，密切了党群、政群关系，促进了安定团结和各项事业的发展。昌乐县抓廉洁前后的情况就大不一样。现在，机关干部到农村 “吃、拿、索、要”等不正之风基本不见了。县直干部下乡坚持一菜一汤，不喝酒、不陪餐。过去号称不交粮、不交税、不交提留、不出义务工、不搞计划生育的“五不特区”的崔家乡一些村，通过政务公开、群众监督、廉洁从政，几个“老大难”都迎刃而解了。去年仅非生产性开支就比上年减少了8万多元，相当于全乡村党支部书记、村主任、村文书三职干部两年的工资。往年，昌乐县乡镇收取提留需用一个冬天，去年22个乡镇只用了一个月时间。全县计划生育率达到98％，比1987年提高了5．7％；人口自然增长率由16‰下降到8‰。郯城县政协去年开会，委员们在200多项提案或发言中，没有就党政机关廉洁问题提出批评意见；地委组织乡镇以上干部对县委领导班子进行考评，没有一张不信任票。昌乐县红河镇党委书记体会说，抓廉政，正了三风
  （党风、政风、民风），祛了邪气，换来了六大变化，即党政威望变化、干群关系变化、服务质量变化、生产发展变化、农村风气变化、精神文明变化。可以说，一旦廉政问题有了突破，许多工作就会一顺百顺、一通百通。反之，虽令不行，欲动不得，许多工作难以落实。对这一点，我们各级领导同志应当有充分的认识。
    三、搞好廉洁从政，要靠透明度和制度化
    郯城、昌乐县廉洁问题解决得比较好，并非有什么“灵丹妙药”，而是从群众最关心的问题入手，走出了一条依靠透明度和制度建设的新路子。过去，我们也强调党员干部要廉洁，并建立了监督检查组织，但没有从根本上找到在商品经济条件下，防止腐败的有效途径。现在，把透明度、制度建设和传统的监督、检查及思想教育等方法结合起来，威力就发挥出来了。原因就在于，过去我们的许多政策、规章、办法，虽然也很好，但群众不知道，或者知道的甚少。办事不公开，群众无法监督，少数人营私舞弊也就有隙可乘。郯城、昌乐县实行政务公开，加大透明度，能公开的事情一律公开，暴露在阳光之下，丑恶的东西就失去了藏身之地。郯城县设立了“土地承包费收缴明细榜”和“开支明细榜”后，解决了乱收提留、乱摊派问题，去年人均提留只占人均收入的４．２％。昌乐县所有乡镇和９５％的村都建立了群众监督和议政组织，设立各类公开栏２２６１个，为群众监督、参政创造了条件。如他们将农用紧缺物资一次按标准分配到村，并公诸于众。有的乡干部暗中挪用了２００斤平价柴油，有的职工克扣农民３袋平价化肥，很快就被群众揭发出来，并将实物公开在乡政府门前展出，给全县干部、职工以深刻教育。很明显，在众目睽睽之下，谁要再搞不正之风就不容易了，即使有搞的也会被及时举报、解决。他们的经验还说明，仅仅对某些政务实行公开和监督是不够的，往往“人在政在，人走政亡”。只有在民主政治建设上进行综合配套改革，使之制度化、规范化，才能减少以至消除滋生腐败现象的土壤。昌乐县普遍建立了政务公开、检查监督、检举举报、考核查处、协商对话、舆论监督、民主评议、人民来信来访等八项制度。有些村还建立了人民参政议政制度，凡村里的大事、难事，都先交党员或村民议事会讨论，然后再作决定，由过去的事后监督变为事前监督，效果尤好。
    四、坚持从严治党、治政
    中央关于我们党和政府廉洁状况的估计，完全符合山东的实际。应当说，山东省绝大多数党政机关作风是好的，绝大多数党员干部也是好的，是廉洁奉公、勤奋工作的。但是，也确实有少数党员干部、工作人员弄权渎职，以权谋私，贪污受贿，损害公家和人民利益，在群众中造成了很坏的影响，而且有些问题愈演愈烈，到了非解决不可的时候了。要消除种种腐败现象，必须坚持从严治党治政，采取综合治理的方针。要把强化党的宗旨教育与建立制度结合起来，把自我约束与严肃查处结合起来，把扶正与祛邪结合起来。不正之风、奢侈腐败问题的发生，根本原因是少数人忘记、背弃了党的全心全意为人民服务的宗旨，滋长了贪图私利的极端个人主义思想。要根治这种毛病，还是要注重思想教育。当前要突出强调对党员干部进行党的宗旨教育，进一步明确党和政权机关的性质，国家工作人员的神圣职责，切实解决好为谁掌权、为谁工作、为谁服务的问题。树立为人民献身光荣、以权谋私耻辱的荣辱观，去掉特权思想，增强公仆意识，自觉做到忠于职守，大公无私，不图私利，从而在全体党员干部思想上筑起抵御腐朽思想侵袭的强大堤防。进行这种教育必须和建立制度相结合。当前要突出建立好政务公开制度、检查监督制度、人民参政议政制度、举报制度和考核查处制度。制度一经建立，就要严格遵行，说到做到，违者必纠。再者，要保持廉洁，对绝大多数党员、干部来说，主要是靠教育、靠觉悟、靠自我约束。要大力表彰为政清廉的机关、单位和个人。同时对极少数违犯党纪、政纪、法纪的党员干部，必须严肃查处，决不手软。郯城县去年针对招工中作弊的问题，采取思想动员、个人认卷、复试对笔迹等方法，查出替考者１７１人，全部作了清退处理，赢得了群众好评，杜绝了类似问题再次发生。聊城地区对两起违犯规定接受吃请的干部，作了严肃处理，大刹了吃喝之风。近几个月，地直机关招待费比整顿以前平均每月下降了５３％，各县市平均下降６６％。实践证明，只有对极少数问题严重的人依法处理，才能教育大多数人，收到“法严纲正，行必规焉”之效。
    五、领导机关要率先垂范，建立廉洁责任制
    最近，山东省委、省政府制定了《省级党政干部廉洁勤政守则》，作出了１２条规定，将公诸于众，接受各级各部门和群众监督。以后，省里同志到下面工作，一律吃份饭，不准宴请、陪餐，希望各地同志一律照办。省委、省政府和省直单位一律不准向基层和企业索要物品，各地各单位也一律不准向领导机关、部门和干部用公款送礼品。今年春节要严格把关，作为为政清廉的良好开端。省级机关要以廉政为中心，集中进行机关作风整顿和制度建设。为此，我们准备组织各市地、各部门对省级机关、部门的工作、作风进行一次全面的民主评议，提出批评和建议。
    今年，全省各级党政机关要把为政清廉作为一件特别重要的大事来抓。要建立严格的廉洁责任制。各级党委、政府和部门都要按照日常工作的分工，把自己负责的地方、系统和单位的廉洁抓好。各级党政一把手，要对党政“一班人”的廉洁负全责。山东省委常委确定，由我负责抓常委班子的自身廉洁，省长负责省政府领导班子的廉洁，其他书记、常委负责所分管部门的廉洁。要一级抓一级，一级带一级，抓得不好就是没有尽职尽责，如果因疏忽大意而发生了重大问题，要追究失职的责任。各级干部任期目标和岗位责任制，要突出为政清廉，强调严守法纪、不贪赃枉法；秉公尽责、不以权谋私；艰苦奋斗，不奢侈浪费。今后，考核一级党委、政府的工作，不只是看经济发展如何，还要看是否端正了党风、政风，做到了廉洁，考核一个干部政绩，也要把廉洁作为一项重要内容，由此促进我省廉政工作深入、广泛地开展起来。　（本文作者为中共山东省委书记）
