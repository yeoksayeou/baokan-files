The year before last, I came to work in Hainan. By this September, Hainan had been in drought for more than 20 months. The Songtao Reservoir, with a capacity of 3.3 billion cubic meters, had less than 800 million cubic meters of water left, with less than 100 million cubic meters available for irrigation. The Niulu Ling Reservoir, with a capacity of 600 million cubic meters, had dropped below the dead water level, and the 60,000-kilowatt hydroelectric power station had stopped operating. Some coastal villages without rivers, reservoirs, or groundwater faced difficulties in obtaining drinking water. This was the driest year on record. Everyone said, "If only we could have a few heavy rainstorms!"

Hainan's climate is dry in spring and summer, but wet in autumn and winter. Generally, it does not rain heavily, except when a typhoon comes, which can bring heavy rain. Some places can receive 400-500 millimeters of rain in 24 hours.

September and October are the typhoon season. In times of severe drought, people long for the typhoon to bring rain.

While waiting for the rain, I thought of Su Shi, who lived in Hainan for three years and wrote an essay called "Record of the Joy of Rain Pavilion": "In the year Dingmao, it rained heavily for three days. Officials celebrated in the courtyard, merchants sang in the market, and farmers rejoiced in the fields. The worried were happy, the sick were cured, and my pavilion was just completed.... If the sky rained pearls, the cold would not be able to use them as clothing; if the sky rained jade, the hungry would not be able to use them as grain. It rained for three days, whose power was this? The people said it was the governor, but the governor did not claim it. They attributed it to the emperor, but the emperor said no. They attributed it to the Creator, but the Creator did not take credit. They attributed it to the vast sky, but the vast sky is dark and obscure, and cannot be named. I name my pavilion after it."

Su Shi wrote about the joy of the people after a heavy rain following a severe drought, which is vividly described.

Our current water conservancy conditions are vastly different from Su Shi's time. However, after a prolonged drought, the reservoirs are dry, and we must rely on rain to replenish them.

Droughts can be fought against by afforestation, building reservoirs, and improving irrigation channels, all of which are effective measures. But if the sky does not rain or snow, the consequences for humanity are unimaginable.

Now, people can use anti-aircraft guns to shoot into the sky and airplanes to spread silver iodide to make artificial rain. However, without cumulonimbus clouds, a clear sky has no conditions for water droplets to form, and any rain-making agent is useless.

Several counties have used anti-aircraft guns to fight the sky, and some places have succeeded in bringing in cumulonimbus clouds, resulting in small-scale rain, but the maximum amount is only a few dozen millimeters, which is like a drop in the bucket and does not solve the problem.

People are still hoping for the arrival of a typhoon.

I grew up by the sea and have spent most of my time working in coastal areas, so I am quite familiar with typhoons. I have experienced the taste of a Category 12 typhoon. Decades ago, rural houses were mostly made of mud bricks and tiles. When a strong typhoon hit, the howling wind mixed with flying sand and stones, causing tiles to fly and walls to collapse. The sound and sight of it are still fresh in my memory.

Of course, people have learned to avoid and resist typhoons in their lives, minimizing losses and developing a certain "tolerance" for typhoons.

People in inland areas do not understand typhoons very well. I thought of Su Dongpo again. He never saw a typhoon in his life until he was 60 years old and came to Huizhou, Guangdong, where he encountered a typhoon in the second year of his stay. Su Dongpo, in his panic, had his son Su Guo write "Essay on the Typhoon," describing the most intense part of the typhoon:

"The wind blows through the doors and windows, breaking tiles and walls, striking large rocks, uprooting tall trees, overturning the Bohai Sea, shaking the earth's axis. It seems like the screen of the sun god is angry, and the sun god is about to be executed. The wind blows a thousand stones, overturning a hundred ridges, swallowing mud and sand in one roll, and falling from the cliffs to hit again. A thousand horses run wild, and a thousand soldiers are scattered. I was so frightened that my hair stood on end, and I gasped for breath. At night, I moved nine times, and during the day, I consulted the tortoise shell three times. It took three days for the wind to stop."

Su Shi praised his son's essay highly.

It is one-sided to only describe the frightening side of typhoons without mentioning the benefits they bring. Things often have two sides, and typhoons are no exception. The view of typhoons should not only see the immediate damage to sugarcane and rice, flying tiles, and collapsing doors, but also the full reservoirs and operating hydroelectric power stations. This is seeing the forest for the trees.

Finally, in October of last year, Typhoons 23 and 24 hit Hainan in succession, bringing heavy rain to the entire island. Looking at the places affected by the typhoon, the damage is evident. The province had 117 villages with 40,000 people surrounded by floodwaters, 460,000 mu of rice fields submerged, 100,000 mu of tropical crops damaged, and some houses destroyed. However, the Songtao Reservoir was filled with 1.8 billion cubic meters of water, and the Niulu Ling Reservoir overflowed. Large and small reservoirs throughout the province were full of water. The 300,000-kilowatt hydroelectric power stations were all operating, and there was no worry about water for agricultural production in the coming years.

This is called the whole province benefiting, with some places suffering damage. Long-term overall benefits, short-term local damage. The conclusion is: the benefits outweigh the harm.

Things cannot be perfect. We cannot expect everything to be beneficial and harm-free. Since benefits and harms come together, we should strive to maximize benefits and minimize harms, and avoid idle talk and criticism.

From the two sides of typhoons, I thought of the current reform and opening up and the economic situation.

Reform and opening up have promoted the development of productive forces, broken the closed and stagnant situation, increased commodities, and improved living standards. Everyone benefits, just like these two typhoons bringing sweet rain, filling reservoirs, generating electricity, and ensuring water supply for production.

However, reform and opening up also brought some problems and difficulties. Can we demand that there be no problems or difficulties? Just like typhoons, can we demand that they only blow away dust and garbage, dead leaves and branches, without uprooting trees, and that the rain only falls into the reservoirs without damaging crops?

If we could ensure that during a drought, typhoons come neither too big nor too small, with just the right amount of rain to fill the reservoirs without flooding the rice fields or knocking down the sugarcane, that would be truly perfect. Unfortunately, we are not the sun god, and there is no rain god in the world; we are not the god of waves and tides, just the imagination of ancient people. Due to the different wavelengths of solar radiation and temperature differences, the atmosphere is constantly stirring and changing, and it is also affected by land and sea, clouds and stars, climate, latitude, ground conditions, and altitude. Its changes are very irregular, and people have not yet been able to control the movement and changes of the atmosphere at will.

Reform and opening up are also similar. This is a complex system project. In the process of smooth progress, there will inevitably be some obstacles, and problems and difficulties will arise. We cannot treat it like operating a lathe to cut parts, according to the size and shape of the sample, and according to the specified size standards, to operate the cutting tool, cut to the standard, and stop at the right time, completely according to the design to make parts. Unfortunately, things are not so simple. Reform and opening up are indeed different from operating a lathe. How can we demand that everything be just right?

When faced with two benefits, choose the heavier one; when faced with two harms, choose the lighter one. This is a way to choose.

Since we are hoping for typhoons, we should not fear them.

Since we want reform and opening up, we should not demand perfection.

Idle talk and practical work are different. Sitting and discussing is not as good as summarizing experience and offering advice. Participating in practice is even better. Simple affirmation or negation, or ridicule and cursing, are all useless.

　　说台风
    许士杰
    前年来海南工作，到今年９月，海南已干旱了２０多个月。有３３亿立方米库容量的松涛水库，存水不足８亿立方米，可以放出来灌溉的不够１亿立方米。６亿立方米库容量的牛路岭水库，已到死水位之下，６万千瓦水电站停止运转了。沿海一些没有河流与水库、又没有地下水的村庄，饮水也困难。这是历史上最干旱的年份。大家都说，能下几场大暴雨多好啊！
    海南的气候，春夏是旱季，秋冬却多雨，但一般不降大暴雨，只有台风来了，才会带来大暴雨。一些地方，有时２４小时可降雨４００—５００厘米。
    ９、１０月份，是台风季节。大旱望云霓，久旱盼台风。人们都企盼台风带来暴雨。
    在盼雨中遐思，我联想起曾在海南住了三年的苏轼写过一篇《喜雨亭记》：“丁卯大雨，三日乃止。官吏相与庆于庭，商贾相与歌于市，农夫相与忭于野。忧者以喜，病者以愈，而我亭适成。……使天而雨珠，寒者不得以为襦，使天而雨玉，饥者不得以为粟。一雨三日，伊谁之力？民曰太守，太守不有。归之天子，天子曰不然。归之造物，造物不自以为功。归之太空，太空冥冥，不可得而名，吾以名我亭。”
    东坡写大旱之后，下雨三天的全民欢呼鼓舞之情，跃然如现。
    我们现在的水利条件，跟苏轼那个时代有天壤之别。但在连续干旱之后，水库之水也干了，当然要靠雨水来补充。
    旱灾是可以抗的，造林、修水库、整渠道，都是有效的办法。但如果天不降雨下雪，人类将是不可设想的。
    现在人们可以用高射炮发射，用飞机撒布碘化银，去人工造雨。但是如果没有积雨云，晴朗的天空是没有条件凝结成水滴的，任何催雨剂也都无济于事。
    几个县曾用高射炮与天斗，有的地方打入了积雨云，获得了小面积下雨，但最大也不外几十厘米，杯水车薪，解决不了问题。
    人们仍然在企盼台风的莅临。
    我生长于海滨，大半时间也工作于临海地区，对台风是比较熟悉的，曾尝过十二级台风的滋味。几十年前农村的房屋，多是泥砖瓦片，碰到强台风，凄厉的风声，夹杂着飞砂走石的巨响，砖滚瓦飞，墙倒门塌，至今历历在目。
    当然，人们在生活中，已总结出避台风抗台风的办法，可以做到少损失，对台风已有了“承受能力”。
    生活于内地的人，是不大了解台风的。我又想起了苏东坡，他一生不见台风，直到他六十岁来到广东惠州的第二年九月，才碰到台风。苏学士惊惶之余，命其子苏过作《飓风赋》，苏过描写风势最盛时的情景，颇为生动：
    “排户破牖，殒瓦辟屋，礌击巨石，揉拔乔木，势翻渤海，响震坤轴。疑屏翳之赫怒，执阳候将戮，鼓千石之清澜，翻百仞之陵谷，吞泥沙于一卷，落崩崖而再触，列万马而并骛，溃千军而争逐。予也为之股栗毛耸，索气侧足。夜附榻而九徙，昼命龟而三卜。盖三日而后息也。”
    苏轼很赞扬其子所作之赋。
    光描写台风可怕的一面是片面的，不写台风带来的好处还不能反映客观实际。事物往往具有两重性，是矛盾的统一，台风也如此。对台风的看法，只看它一时带来的蔗倒稻烂，瓦飞门塌，而看不到水库水满，水电发电，这是只见树木，不见森林。
    终于，去年的１０月份，２３号２４号台风，相继光临海南，带来全岛普下大暴雨。光从遭受袭击的地方看，触目所及，是遭受损失的。全省有１１７个村庄，４万多人口，被洪水围困，水稻受浸４６万亩，热带作物受灾１０万亩，房屋也有被损坏的。但是，松涛水库装了１８亿立方水，牛路岭水库溢洪了。全省大大小小的水库都是水光潋滟、碧波荡漾。３０万千瓦的水电都运转了，明后年农业生产的用水无忧了。
    这叫做全省全面受益，一些地方受灾，长期全面受益，当前局部受灾。结论是：利大害小。
    事物不可能十全十美，我们不能祈求事事都有利无害。既然利与害俱来，我们要努力做到利多害少，趋利避害，而不能袖手清谈，冷眼责备。
    我从台风的两重性，又浮想连翩，想到当前的改革开放与经济形势。
    改革与开放，促进了生产力的发展，打破了封闭停滞的局面，商品多了，生活水平提高了，大家都受益，有如这两股台风，带来了甘霖暴雨，水库满，水电发，用水足，利生产。
    但在改革与开放中，也带来了某些毛病与问题。我们能要求什么毛病都不出，什么困难都没有么？如同台风一样，我们怎能要求，台风只刮走灰尘垃圾，残叶枯枝，而树木不被摧拔，暴雨只降于水库之中，农作物一点不受损害呢？
    如果我们能做到，干旱时来台风，不大又不小，雨量大，水库满，不淹稻，不倒蔗，十全十美，那实在是阿弥陀佛，皆大欢喜了。
    可惜，我们不是屏翳，世上也没有雨师风神；我们不是阳候波涛之神，只是古代人们的想象。由于太阳辐射的波长与冷热的不同，大气在不停地激荡与运动变化着，而且还要受海陆、云星、气节、纬度、地表性质、海拔高度的影响，其变化是很不规则的，人们还未能随心所欲地去控制大气的运动与变化。
    改革与开放，也有点类似。这是复什的系统工程，在顺利中往往带来某些阽阻，当然会碰到问题与困难。我们不能像在车床上车零件那样，照样品的大小圆扁，按规定的尺寸标准，去开动车刀，切削到符合标准，适可而止，完全是按照设计制成部件。可惜，事物不可能如此简单，改革与开放，毕竟与操纵车床不同，怎么能要求都事事都恰到好处呢？
    两利相权取其重，两害相衡取其轻，这是可以选择的办法。
    既然盼台风，就不要怕台风。
    既然要改革开放，就不能求全责备。
    清谈与实干是不同的。坐而论道，不如总结经验，出谋献策。参与实践当然更好。简单的肯定与否定，或者讥讽与骂娘，都是无济于事的。
