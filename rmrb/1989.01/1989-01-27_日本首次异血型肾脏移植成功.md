Japan's first ABO-incompatible kidney transplant was successfully performed at Tokyo Women's Medical University. According to reports, the recipient of the kidney transplant was a 27-year-old man with type O blood, and the donor was his mother, who has type B blood. Under normal circumstances, after a type O blood recipient receives a kidney from a type B blood donor, the type O blood antibodies will react against the type B blood cells, forming clots and causing symptoms such as obstruction of red blood cells in the kidney.

　　日本首次异血型肾脏移植成功
    日本东京女子医科大学首次为不同血型患者进行肾脏移植手术获得成功。据报道，接受肾脏移植手术的是一位Ｏ型血的２７岁男子，提供肾脏的是其母亲，血型为Ｂ型。一般情况下，Ｏ型血患者在接受了Ｂ型血者的肾脏后，Ｏ型血抗体对Ｂ型血球会产生排斥作用，形成结块，引起肾脏中红球体阻塞等症状。
