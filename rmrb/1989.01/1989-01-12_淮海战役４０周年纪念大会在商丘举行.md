The 40th anniversary commemoration of the Huaihai Campaign was held yesterday in Shangqiu, Henan, the center of the campaign.

The Huaihai Campaign was one of the three major strategic battles during the War of Liberation. At that time, the East China and Central China Field Armies, along with local armed forces from East China, Central China, and North China, totaling over 600,000 troops, fought under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. They converged in Huaihai, battled in the Central Plains, and fought fiercely for 65 days, annihilating over 555,000 enemy troops.

After the commemoration meeting, the provincial party, government, and military leaders of Henan, along with old cadres and veterans who had participated in the Huaihai Campaign, visited the Huaihai Campaign Martyrs' Cemetery to pay tribute to the 24,000 revolutionary martyrs who had sacrificed their lives here.
