Officials from the Supreme People's Procuratorate have revealed that current economic crimes have eight major characteristics.

First, major and particularly serious cases of embezzlement and bribery remain prominent. In 1986, procuratorial organs nationwide investigated and filed 39,600 cases of embezzlement and bribery, accounting for 80% of the total cases filed. In 1987, 28,000 cases were investigated and filed, accounting for 75% of the total cases. From January to October 1988, 16,000 cases were investigated and filed, accounting for 71% of the total cases.

In 1987, procuratorial organs nationwide investigated and filed 5,392 major and particularly serious economic crime cases, accounting for 17% of the total cases. From January to October 1988, 2,400 cases were investigated and filed, accounting for 16% of the total cases. In some regions, major and particularly serious economic crime cases are on the rise.

Second, the incidence of crimes in the grain and oil system has increased. In 1986, the banking and supply and marketing systems had higher incidence rates, with procuratorial organs investigating and filing cases that generally accounted for about 70% of the total cases. Since 1987, economic crimes in these two departments have decreased by half, while the number of cases in the grain and oil departments has increased severalfold.

Third, there is a trend of younger offenders. According to statistics from the Huangshan City Procuratorate in Anhui Province and the Chongqing City Procuratorate, from January to August of this year, 30 economic crime suspects under the age of 35 were investigated and filed, accounting for 53% of the total number of suspects.

Fourth, there is a serious problem of joint criminal acts and collusion between insiders and outsiders. From 1987 to September of this year, there were 14 joint criminal acts, involving 63 suspects, with an average of 5 people per case, and some cases involving over 100 people.

Fifth, the proportion of state cadres committing crimes is increasing. From 1987 to September 1988, the Xinjian County Procuratorate investigated and dealt with 89 suspects, of whom 31 were responsible cadres of units, accounting for 35% of the total number of suspects.

Sixth, the methods and means of committing crimes have changed. In the past, economic criminals mainly falsified accounts, but now they often manipulate accounts outside the books or use computers to commit crimes.

Seventh, there is a serious problem of suspects fleeing with the money after committing crimes. According to statistics from procuratorial organs in Guangzhou, Wenzhou, and Bengbu, this year, 38 economic crime suspects have fled, with some fleeing abroad with the money.

Eighth, the proceeds from crimes are mainly used for extravagant spending. This includes purchasing high-end consumer goods, feasting, or gambling.

　　最高人民检察院有关人士透露
    当前经济犯罪活动有八大特点
    一、重大、特大的贪污、受贿案件仍很突出。１９８６年全国检察机关立案侦查贪污、受贿案件３．９６万件，占立案总数的８０％；１９８７年立案侦查２．８万件，占立案总数的７５％；１９８８年１至１０月立案侦查１．６万件，占立案总数的７１％。
    １９８７年全国检察机关立案侦查重大、特大经济犯罪案件５３９２件，占立案总数的１７％；１９８８年１至１０月立案侦查２４００件，占立案总数的１６％。有些地区重大、特大经济犯罪案件呈上升趋势。
    二、粮油系统发案率升高。１９８６年银行、供销系统发案率较高，检察机关立案侦查的数量，一般占立案总数的７０％左右；１９８７年以来，这两个部门的经济犯罪减少了１／２，而粮油部门发案数却成倍增长。
    三、作案人员出现低龄化。据安徽省黄山市和重庆市中区检察院统计，今年１至８月立案侦查３５岁以下经济案犯３０人，占全部犯罪人数的５３％。
    四、共同作案、内外勾结作案现象严重。１９８７年至今年９月，就发生共同作案１４件，作案人数达６３人，平均每案有５人之多，有的一案涉及１００余人。
    五、国家干部作案比例上升。江西省新建县检察院１９８７年至１９８８年９月，立案查处的８９名案犯中，有３１人是单位的负责干部，占作案总人数的３５％。
    六、作案方式和手段有了新的变化。以往，经济犯罪分子作案主要在帐目上做文章，现在多在帐外做手脚，或利用电脑作案。
    七、作案后携款潜逃情况严重。仅广州、温州、蚌埠等地检察院统计，今年以来，经济案犯逃跑的有３８人，有的携款逃往国外。
    八、赃款去向多用于挥霍。主要是购买高档消费品、大吃大喝，或进行赌博。
