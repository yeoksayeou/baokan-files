Title: Even County Leaders Are Selling Books?

Recently, I interviewed a county leader. As soon as I sat down in his office, he pointed to a pile of books in the corner and said, "Look, this is a book published by a certain bureau director in the province. He asked me to sell 2,000 copies. The county has already advanced the money for the books, but not a single copy has been sold." Upon further inquiry, it turned out that the content of the book was pieced together from newspaper articles, which is why the public was not interested.

These days, publishing a book seems to be no longer an unattainable goal, and writing is no longer the exclusive domain of scholars and intellectuals. Some leaders have also started to take pride in seeing their names in print, thus opening up a "second front" and eagerly "writing books and establishing doctrines." Perhaps they can gain a professional title, or perhaps they can achieve immortality. It's truly a changing of the times, and literary fame has become fashionable. However, in the process of writing and selling these books, one can vaguely see the influence of "power": bureau directors write books, and county leaders sell them, which is a clear example.

Readers' discernment has indeed improved. They know in their hearts what books are worth buying and what books are not. The right to publish books belongs to you, but the right to buy books belongs to me. In reality, it is indeed the case that the value of a book is not determined by the author's rank, and whether a book can be sold is not determined by the seller's power. If the quality is poor, no matter how high the author's position, it is bound to be "lonely and unsold."

Using power to publish books and using power to sell books is a tragedy for the publishing and distribution industry.

Leaders should respect themselves and not force readers to accept books of poor quality and high price. I hope that the doors of publishing and distribution departments will all have four big characters: "Quality First."

### 县长也兼卖书郎？

　　县长也兼卖书郎？
    毛志远
    不久前，我采访一位县长。在他的办公室刚落座，他就指着墙角的一堆书说：“你看，这是省里某厅长出的书，让我推销２０００本，县上先垫支了书钱，现在一本也卖不出去。”我再一细问，原来书上的内容都是从报刊上拼凑的，难怪群众不买账。
    时下，出书似乎已不是高不可攀的事，著述也不再是文人学士们的专利。一些领导干部，也开始以把自己的名字变成铅字为荣，于是乎，开辟了“第二战场”，纷纷“著书立说”，一则或许可以捞上个把专业职务，二则可以流芳百世。真是风水轮流转，书香也风流了。然而，他们的大作问世与经销中也隐约可见一个“权”字：厅长写书县长卖，便是明证。
    读者的鉴赏能力毕竟是提高了，什么书该买，什么书不该买，他们心里都有一杆秤，出书权归你，买书权在我。事实也正是这样，一本书有没有价值不是取决于作者的职务高低，一本书能不能销出也并不是在于售书人的权力大小。如果质量低下，哪怕作者有再大的官职，也活该“寂寞开无主”的。
    以权出书，以权售书，是出版发行工作的悲哀。
    领导同志当自尊自重，切莫再把质次价高的书硬塞给读者了。但愿出版发行部门的大门上都能写上四个大字：质量第一。
