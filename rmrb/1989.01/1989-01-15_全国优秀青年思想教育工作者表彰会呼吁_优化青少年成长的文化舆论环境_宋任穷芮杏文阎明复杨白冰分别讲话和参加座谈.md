Today, Song Renqiong called for optimizing the cultural and public opinion environment for youth growth. All newspapers, television, radio, film, opera, and publishing departments should actively work to provide young people with rich and healthy cultural choices and spiritual products. With a sense of responsibility towards future generations, they should prioritize social benefits and consciously resist the corruption of decadent culture on youth.

Song Renqiong made these remarks at the closing ceremony of the National Excellent Youth Ideological Educators Award Ceremony and the first annual meeting of the Youth Ideological Education Research Center. He said that doing a good job in youth ideological education is not just the responsibility of the Communist Youth League and educational departments, but a shared mission for the entire Party and society.

Song Renqiong emphasized that as the situation changes, the content and methods of ideological and political work must be continuously improved and enriched. The system and structure of ideological and political work must also be continuously adjusted and improved. However, the important position that ideological and political work holds in all fields during the entire socialist historical period remains unchanged. Ideological and political work must never be weakened, especially during critical historical periods. This is one of our basic experiences in carrying out socialist revolution and construction, and it is also one of the basic characteristics of a socialist society.

On the afternoon of the 13th, Rui Xingwen, in a dialogue with representatives from schools, enterprises, local party committees, and the Women's Federation, said that the current situation education is a good opportunity to strengthen and improve ideological and political work. Situation education should be combined with reform and opening up, with the development of a commodity economy, and with the tasks of ideological education. Ideological education should both carry forward good traditions and adapt to new environments, new situations, and new objects, making improvements. Only through improvement can it be strengthened; otherwise, it will be twice as difficult.

On the morning of the 14th, Yan Mingfu, in a dialogue with representatives of the Communist Youth League, said that the Youth League should address youth's ideological issues and hot topics through various forms of lively and vibrant ideological education, helping youth to have a correct understanding of the current situation. In places with conditions, youth should be guided to actively participate in social supervision, transforming them from spectators and commentators into practical workers in rectifying economic order and carrying out social supervision.

On the morning of the 14th, Yang Baibing, in a conversation with military representatives attending the meeting, pointed out that at this crucial moment of reform, when reform encounters difficulties, we must leverage our political advantages. Our Party and our military have political advantages. The comrades who have been selected as national excellent youth ideological educators should play the role of seeds, making the ideological education work in the entire army bloom more flowers and bear more fruits.

　　全国优秀青年思想教育工作者表彰会呼吁
    优化青少年成长的文化舆论环境
    宋任穷芮杏文阎明复杨白冰分别讲话和参加座谈
    本报北京１月１４日讯  记者周庆报道：今天，宋任穷在一次发言中呼吁：要优化青少年成长的文化、舆论环境，一切报刊、电视、广播、电影、戏曲、出版等文化部门，应当通过积极的工作，为青年成长提供丰富健康的文化选择和精神产品，以对子孙后代负责的精神，注重社会效益，自觉抵制腐朽文化对青少年的腐蚀。
    宋任穷是在今天结束的全国优秀青年思想教育工作者表彰会和青年思想教育研究中心第一届年会闭幕式上说这番话的。他说，做好青年的思想教育工作不仅是共青团和教育部门的事情，而且是全党全社会共同担负的光荣使命。
    宋任穷强调指出，随着形势的变化，思想政治工作的内容和方法应当不断得到改进和充实，思想政治工作的体制和格局，也应当不断得到调整和完善，但是在整个社会主义历史时期，思想政治工作在各个领域中占有的重要地位却是始终不变的，思想政治工作在任何时候都不能有丝毫的削弱，在历史的关键时期尤其如此。这是我们进行社会主义革命和建设的基本经验之一，也是社会主义社会的基本特征之一。
    １３日下午，芮杏文与来自学校、企业、地方党委、妇联等方面的代表对话时说，当前开展的形势教育，是加强和改进思想政治工作的好机会。要把形势教育同改革开放、同发展商品经济、同思想教育的任务结合起来。思想教育既要发扬好的传统，又要同新环境、新情况、新对象相适应，加以改进。只有改进，才能加强，否则就会事倍功半。
    １４日上午，阎明复与共青团的代表对话。他说，共青团应针对青年的思想问题、热门话题，展开各种形式、生动活泼的思想教育，使青年对当前的形势有个正确的认识。有条件的地方，要引导青年积极参与社会监督，使他们从旁观者、评论家变为投身整顿经济秩序、开展社会监督的实干家。
    １４日上午，杨白冰在与参加会议的军队代表交谈中指出，在改革的关键时刻，在改革遇到困难的时候，要发挥政治优势，我们的党、我们的军队，是有政治优势的。这次被评为全国优秀青年思想教育工作者的同志要发挥种子的作用，使思想教育工作在全军开出更多的花，结出更多的果。
