Once the election was over, the elected president, Perez, immediately began his busy work, engaging in extensive dialogues with various sectors within the country and visiting three Middle Eastern countries and the United States in quick succession. He repeatedly emphasized the need to form a national coordination government, with consultation being the most important policy for governance. From the results of this election and the current economic situation in Venezuela, it is clear that mobilizing positive factors from all sides through consultation and organizing an efficient government are urgent tasks for Perez in his new term under the new historical conditions.

In this election, Perez won again thanks to the reputation he gained during his term in the 1970s, but his Democratic Action Party lost its majority in the parliament. The second-largest party, the Christian Social Party, increased its votes in the parliamentary group by 31% compared to the previous election. The third-largest party, the Movement Toward Socialism, also increased its share in the parliament from 5.7% to 10.3%. These results indicate that Perez's government will face a more difficult parliament. Therefore, the consultation policy he proposed first means how to handle the relationship with the opposition parties in the parliament.

In the 1970s, the Democratic Action Party and the Christian Social Party reached an agreement on the distribution of leadership positions in the parliament, known as the "institutional agreement." According to this agreement, the president of the Senate and the first vice-president of the House of Representatives were to be held by the ruling party, while the other party would hold the presidency of the House of Representatives and the first vice-presidency of the Senate. Perez is inclined to expand this agreement, distributing leadership positions according to the proportion of votes each party received in the parliament. This would be beneficial for the Democratic Action Party and the Movement Toward Socialism, as well as other small parties, to control the parliament. On December 16, the Democratic Action Party's central executive committee held its first meeting after the election, generally confirming the principle of expanding the "institutional agreement." The meeting also decided to continue consultations with other parties on this issue. However, the "institutional agreement" directly affects the future political status of the Christian Social Party, and it is estimated that there will be intense bargaining ahead.

Compared to the political situation, the economic situation is even more severe for Perez. Oil exports have decreased, and oil prices are very fragile. Last year's oil income almost dropped to the 1986 level, at only $8 billion. The amount of foreign debt repayment last year was as high as $4.3 billion. Additionally, the government increased imports to control the inflation rate, and it is estimated that the trade deficit last year will reach more than $3 billion. Inflation is also rising, exceeding the government's target and reaching 30%. Public opinion generally believes that Perez is facing numerous difficult problems, including reduced national income, heavy foreign debt burden, imbalanced international and government fiscal balances, and worsening social poverty, which need to be solved. Economic adjustment is inevitable, and he needs to listen to the opinions of various social strata and bring clear suggestions and plans to his inauguration on February 2.

The so-called consultation is actually about coordinating the conflicts and interests of various sides and strata. Currently, the broad labor masses urgently demand controlling inflation and ensuring that wage increases are not lower than the inflation rate to guarantee the improvement of real income levels. The business community, on the other hand, is concerned about reducing government spending and decreasing state intervention to provide guarantees for the private economy. It seems that truly coordinating the interests of various sides will not be easy. However, domestic and foreign commentary generally believes that Perez's government will inevitably implement austerity policies this year, and the future economic team will likely rely more on the business community.

Currently, Venezuela's economic difficulties are directly related to oil prices and foreign debt issues. A few days after Perez was elected, he immediately visited Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Algeria, three OPEC member countries, and then flew to the United States to meet with Bush. Through consultations with the leaders of these countries, it is clear that Venezuela hopes to stabilize oil prices and resolve debt issues amicably.

Currently, Perez's consultation policy has received a wide response domestically. Internationally, especially in Latin American countries, Perez's election has been welcomed. People hope that Perez will achieve something under the new historical conditions.

Of course, the consultation policy is just beginning, and how Perez will implement it in the new government remains to be seen.

　　协商：委内瑞拉当选总统的课题
    本报记者  朱满庭
    大选一结束，当选总统佩雷斯就开始了紧张的工作，广泛与国内各界进行对话，并马不停蹄地访问了中东三国和美国。他多次强调将组织一个全国协调政府，执政的最重要政策是协商。从这次大选的结果和委内瑞拉当前的经济形势看，通过协商调动各方面的积极因素，组织一个有效率的政府，确是佩雷斯在新的历史条件下重新执政的紧迫课题。
    这次大选，佩雷斯虽以其在７０年代执政时赢得的声誉再次取胜，但他的民主行动党却失去了议会中的多数。而第二大党基督教社会党在议会党团的得票比上次选举高达３１％。第三大党争取社会主义运动在议会中的比重也从原有的５．７％上升到１０．３％。这种结果说明，佩雷斯政府将遇到一个比较难对付的国会。因此，他提出的协商政策首先意味着如何在国会处理与反对党的关系。
    在７０年代，民行党和基社党曾就两党在国会的领导席位配置达成一个所谓“体制协议”。按此协议，参议院议长和众议院第一副议长由执政党担任，另一党则担任众院议长和参院第一副议长。佩雷斯倾向于扩大这一协议，按各党在议会中获得的比重分配领导席位，这样有利于民行党和争取社会主义运动及其他小党控制国会。去年１２月１６日，民行党中央执委举行大选后的首次会议，大体上确定了扩大“体制协议”原则。会议还决定，就此问题与其他党派继续协商。但“体制协议”问题直接涉及基社党未来的政治地位，估计今后将有一番激烈的讨价还价。
    与政治形势相比，经济形势对佩雷斯更为严峻。石油出口减少，油价又十分脆弱。去年的石油收入几乎跌到１９８６年的水平，只有８０亿美元。而外债还本付息额去年高达４３亿美元。再加上政府为压低通货膨胀率增加了进口，估计国际收支逆差去年将达３０多亿美元。而通货膨胀还在不断攀高，已突破了政府预定的目标，达到３０％。舆论普遍认为，佩雷斯面临着国家收入减少、外债负担沉重、国际收支和政府财政收支失衡、社会贫困加重等诸多棘手问题，需要解决。经济调整势在必行，他需要广泛听取社会各阶层的意见，争取今年２月２日能带着明确的建议和计划就职。
    所谓协商，实际上就是协调各方面和各阶层的矛盾和利益。现在广大劳动群众迫切要求控制通货膨胀，使工资增长不低于通货膨胀率，以保证实际收入水平的提高。而实业界则关心压缩政府开支，减少国家干预，为私人经济提供保证。看来，要真正协调好各方面的利益并非易事。不过，国内外的评论一般认为，今年佩雷斯政府不可避免地要实行紧缩政策，今后的经济班子也似将倚重实业集团。
    目前，委内瑞拉的经济困难与石油价格和外债问题直接相关。佩雷斯当选几天后，就立即出访科威特、沙特阿拉伯和阿尔及利亚３个欧佩克成员国，随后又飞往美国，与布什进行会晤。通过与这些国家领导人的协商，表明委内瑞拉希望稳定石油价格和合理解决债务问题的意向。
    目前，佩雷斯的协商政策在国内已得到广泛的响应。国际上，尤其是拉美国家对佩雷斯的当选表示欢迎。人们都希望佩雷斯在新的历史条件下有所作为。
    当然，协商政策还刚刚开头，至于佩雷斯在新政府中怎样贯彻执行，人们还在观察。
