Our county is where the Xizhang River, Nanzhang River, and Beizhang River converge. In recent years, over ten large factories and mines located at the sources of these "three rivers" have been discharging industrial wastewater into the rivers, resulting in severe water pollution. Consequently, 20,850 people in 10 townships across the county have fallen ill due to drinking polluted water, leading to a rise in the disease rate. Many farmers have been forced to relocate. In just the past two years, 685 people from four villages in Beidi Township have moved away, leaving over 2,200 acres of land abandoned. We appeal to the relevant factories that discharge wastewater into these three rivers to take immediate and effective measures to safeguard the health of the people living along the rivers.

　　河水遭污染
  　沿岸病人多
    我县是西漳河、南漳河、北漳河的汇集地。近年来，由于“三河”发源地的１０多家大型厂矿向河内排放工业废水，致使河水严重污染，全县１０个乡镇的２０８５０人因饮用污染水，发病率升高。不少农民被迫迁居，近两年仅北底乡４个村就外迁了６８５人，荒芜土地２２００多亩。呼吁向这三条河内排放污水的有关厂家，立即采取有效措施，以保障“三河”沿岸人民群众的身体健康。
