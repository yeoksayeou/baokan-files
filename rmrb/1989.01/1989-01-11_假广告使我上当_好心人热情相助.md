Fake Advertisement Tricks Me; Kind Stranger Offers Help

I am Mao Guiting, 19 years old, and I live in the Chengjian Bureau of Hengdong County, Hunan. In the first issue of the 1988 _Moqiu_ magazine, I saw a matrimonial advertisement and went to Liguo Township in Tongshan County, Jiangsu, to meet the advertiser on October 5. When I saw the man who placed the advertisement, I was very disappointed. He was a middle-aged man in his 40s, not the 28-year-old as described in the advertisement. He spoke in a stammering way and seemed a bit simple-minded. I was so angry and disappointed that I cried.

As night fell, I found myself without enough money to return to Hunan and had no one to turn to. People around me were gossiping, and I felt so desperate that I wanted to end my life. Just when I was at my wit's end, a female worker named Shao Changlan from the Second Cement Factory in Liguo Township came to my rescue. She took me to her home, comforted me, and lent me some clothes to change into. She also gave me money for my journey back to Hunan and saw me off.

I hate that deceitful matrimonial advertisement and the person who created it. I am grateful to Shao Changlan and her family for their kindness. I also hope that my sisters will learn from my experience and not blindly believe in fake advertisements. I hope that newspapers and magazines will be more careful when publishing matrimonial advertisements.

### 假广告使我上当  好心人热情相助

　　假广告使我上当  好心人热情相助
    我叫毛桂婷，１９岁，家住湖南衡东县城建局。我从１９８８年第一期《莫愁》杂志上看到一则征婚广告，便于１０月５日来到江苏铜山县利国乡与征婚者面谈。见到征婚的男方，我大失所望，他是一个４０多岁的中年人，根本不是征婚广告上说的２８岁，他说话吞吞吐吐，是个半憨人。我被这则编造的征婚广告气哭了。
    天慢慢地黑了下来，我又缺少回湖南的路费，只身在外，举目无亲。周围一些人还说七道八，我真想一死了之。正当我走投无路时，利国乡水泥二厂一位女工邵长兰大姐给我解了围。她把我领到她家，劝说我，安慰我，拿出她的衣服给我更换，还给了我回湖南的路费，送我上路。
    我憎恨那则骗人的征婚广告和编造假广告的人，感谢邵长兰全家对我的照顾。同时希望姐妹们吸取我的教训，不要盲目相信那些假的广告，也希望报纸杂志在刊登征婚广告时把好关。
