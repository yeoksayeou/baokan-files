Last year, the rainfall in northern China was mostly above 500 millimeters, with some regions reaching 700 millimeters. Due to the frequent rainy days, the evaporation rate was relatively low, making the climate in some regions semi-humid or humid. It is hoped that relevant departments will pay attention to the soil moisture conditions. This spring, they should seize the opportunity of the humid climate, which is favorable for high survival rates of planting, and actively deploy tree planting and grass sowing work to achieve twice the results with half the effort.

　　气候湿润　抓紧绿化
    去年，我国北方降雨量大多在５００毫米以上，有些地区可达７００毫米。由于阴雨天气较多，蒸发量较低，一些地区的气候处于半湿润、湿润状态。希望有关部门注意墒情，今年春季抓住气候湿润，种植成活率高的有利时机，积极部署植树种草工作，以期取得事半功倍的效果。
