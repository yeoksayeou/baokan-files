Professor Xu Jintang of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Institute of Medicinal Plant Resource Development has devoted himself to the study of the precious traditional Chinese medicine, Gastrodia. For many years, he and his colleagues have ventured into impoverished mountainous regions, applying their research findings to help farmers cultivate Gastrodia and achieve prosperity. Recently, their research has made new progress. They discovered that during the germination period of Gastrodia seeds, the nutrient supply comes from the purple-spored fungus, rather than the traditional belief in the fungal genus Sebacina. This discovery clarifies the entire life history of Gastrodia from seed germination to maturity, involving a sequential symbiotic relationship with the purple-spored fungus and Sebacina. This finding has significant academic and practical value.

    徐锦堂教授苦心研究天麻
    中国医学科学院药用植物资源开发研究所徐锦堂教授致力于名贵中药天麻的研究。多年来，他和同事们深入贫困山区，运用自己的研究成果，帮助农民栽培天麻脱贫致富。不久前，他们的研究又有新进展，发现在天麻种子萌发期供给营养的是紫萁小菇，而不是植物学界传统认为的密环菌，从而弄清了天麻从种子萌发到长成是与紫萁小菇和密环菌先后共生的全部生活史（发现过程详见本报去年12月4日三版报道）。这项发现有重要学术价值和实用价值。
