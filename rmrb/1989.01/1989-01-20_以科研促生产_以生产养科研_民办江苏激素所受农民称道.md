	Promoting Production Through Research and Sustaining Research Through Production: The People's Praise for the Private Jiangsu Hormone Institute

	People's Daily reports: Correspondent Lin Wei reports: One of the earliest private research institutions in China—the Jiangsu Hormone Research Institute—has, without receiving state operational funds or construction investments, promoted production through research and sustained research through production. It has undertaken 13 national-level research projects, synthesized over a hundred insect pheromone compounds, and developed more than 20 new varieties of pyrethroid analogs. Among these, 20% cypermethrin is exported to Southeast Asia and the Hong Kong and Macau regions.

	Pyrethroid analogs are currently the "fourth-generation" pesticides used by many advanced countries worldwide, known for their high efficiency and low toxicity. They are safe for humans and livestock, do not harm the environment, and do not cause pollution. To promote the widespread application of these pesticides in agricultural production, the Jiangsu Hormone Research Institute has, on one hand, accelerated technological innovation. For example, through their efforts, the raw material cost of the cotton bollworm pheromone has been reduced to approximately 1 yuan per gram, far lower than the initial synthesis cost internationally. On the other hand, they have persistently provided over 20 types of insect pheromones free of charge to thousands of agricultural research, plant protection, and production departments across the country for experimental and trial use. In cooperation with relevant departments in Nanyang County, Henan Province, they provided samples free of charge for large-scale demonstration trials of pheromone control of the cotton bollworm in 63,000 mu of cotton fields, achieving economic benefits of over 200 million yuan and earning praise from farmers in the trial area.

	Currently, the Jiangsu Hormone Research Institute has become the primary base for the synthesis and supply of hormones in China.

　　以科研促生产　以生产养科研
    民办江苏激素所受农民称道
    本报讯  记者林薇报道：我国最早出现的民办科研机构之一——江苏省激素研究所，在不要国家事业费和基建投资的情况下，以科研促生产，以生产养科研，先后承担国家级科研项目１３项，合成出百余种昆虫性诱剂化合物和２０多个拟除虫菊脂新品种，其中２０％氰戊菊脂远销东南亚和港、澳地区。
    拟除虫菊脂类农药是目前国际上许多先进国家使用的“第四代”农药，高效低毒，对人畜安全无害，不污染环境。为使这种农药在农业生产上大面积推广应用，江苏省激素研究所一方面加紧工艺革新，如经过努力，使棉红铃虫性诱剂的原料成本降到１元／克左右，远远低于国际最初合成的成本。另一方面，他们坚持向全国各地的上千个农业科研、植保、生产部门免费提供２０余种昆虫性诱剂，用于试验和试用。在与河南省南阳县有关部门的合作下，他们免费提供样品在６．３万亩棉田中开展性诱剂防治棉红铃虫大面积示范试验，获经济收益２００余万元，受到试验区农民的称道。
    目前，江苏省激素研究所已初步成为我国激素合成和供应的基地。
