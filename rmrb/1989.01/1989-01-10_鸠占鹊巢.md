Forcefully seizing another country's territory and arbitrarily expelling local residents are the savage acts of old colonialism. However, in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and southern Lebanon, this ugly history is being repeated in the 1980s.

According to the "Voice of the Homeland" radio station in Lebanon, the Israeli military on January 5 expelled about 30 Lebanese residents from the southern part of Lebanon it occupies and seized their property. On New Year's Day, Israeli soldiers also expelled 13 Palestinians from the occupied territories, including 7 from the West Bank and 6 from the Gaza Strip.

Southern Lebanon is part of Lebanon's territory. The West Bank and Gaza Strip have historically belonged to Palestine, as clearly stated in the United Nations' 1947 partition resolution. Now, Israel has forcibly occupied these areas and arrogantly expelled the native residents, which is indeed tyrannical!

Even more intolerable is that Israel's actions are not isolated incidents. In the occupied territories alone, there were 48 incidents of expelling local residents last year. The Tel Aviv government also decided to build 8 more Jewish settlements in the occupied territories this year, continuing to send migrants to the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Israel's actions help people understand that the Shamir government, despite international condemnation and advice, repeatedly refuses to engage in dialogue with the PLO and opposes the convening of an international peace conference in the Middle East, stubbornly obstructing the Middle East peace process. In essence, it is simply trying to "occupy the magpie's nest," holding onto Palestinian land without letting go.

　　鸠占鹊巢
    强行霸占别国领土，肆意驱逐当地居民，是老殖民主义的野蛮行径，但在约旦河西岸、加沙地带和黎巴嫩南部，这种丑恶历史却在２０世纪８０年代的今天重演。
    据黎巴嫩“祖国之声”电台报道，以色列军队１月５日从其占领的黎巴嫩南部驱逐了约３０名黎巴嫩居民，并抢走了他们的财产。也是以色列士兵于元旦那天在被占领土上驱逐了１３名巴勒斯坦人，其中７名原住约旦河西岸，６名原住加沙地带。
    黎巴嫩南部是黎巴嫩国土的一部分。约旦河西岸和加沙地带历来属于巴勒斯坦，这在联合国１９４７年的分治决议上写得明明白白。现在，以色列将它们强占，并颐指气使，把土生土长的居民赶出国门之外，这实在霸道得可以！
    更令人不能容忍的是，以色列这样作并非偶尔为之，在被占领土上，仅去年一年就发生了４８起驱赶当地居民的事件。特拉维夫政府还决定今年在被占领土上增建８个犹太人定居点，继续向约旦河西岸和加沙地带源源移民。以色列的所作所为，有助于人们了解，沙米尔政府所以置国际社会的谴责、劝告于不顾，一再拒绝与巴解组织对话，反对召开中东和平国际会议，顽固地阻碍中东和平进程，说穿了，无非是想“鸠占鹊巢”，占住巴勒斯坦人的土地不放。
