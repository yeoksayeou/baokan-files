Edition: 5

The fifth edition of your newspaper on November 9, 1988, published a letter from a reader titled "There Are Many Roadblocks on the Ground in Yichun." After receiving this letter, our bureau's disciplinary committee and the municipal road management office conducted an investigation. Although not all the issues raised in the reader's letter were verified, it was confirmed that some road maintenance workers were issuing unofficial receipts or collecting fees without proper documentation.

In response, we have decided the following:

1. The road maintenance team on Wutong Road, led by Zhang Wenjie, has issues with their fee collection procedures. We have criticized and educated Zhang Wenjie and ordered him to make a self-criticism at a full-staff meeting of the section. We have also deducted the monthly bonuses of team leader Liu Yan and Zhang Wenjie and reported this incident to the entire municipal transportation system.

2. We will clear the road barriers and abolish unnecessary checkpoints.

3. We will plug the loopholes to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.

第5版(读者来信)
专栏：答复反应

　　伊春地面路卡已清理
    １９８８年１１月９日你报第五版刊登《伊春地面路卡多》的读者来信后，我局纪委和市公路管理处作了调查。读者来信反映的问题，虽没有全部查实，但是个别养路员开白条子或不给收据滥收费的做法是存在的。
    为此，我们决定：
    一、梧桐道班张文革收费手续有漏洞，对其批评教育，责令他在全段职工大会上作检查；扣发道班长刘岩和张文革当月奖金；将此事通报全市交通系统。
    二、清理路栏，取消不应设的检查站。
    三、堵塞漏洞，避免今后再发生类似问题。
