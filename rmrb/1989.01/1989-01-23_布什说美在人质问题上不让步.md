U.S. President Bush stated on January 21 that in the effort to rescue American hostages kidnapped in Lebanon, the United States will not make any concessions.

In a free discussion with reporters this morning, the newly inaugurated president said he hopes that "the whole world can hear" his appeal for help in resolving the hostage issue, which he made yesterday in his inaugural address.

Currently, 9 American hostages and several hostages from other countries are being held in Lebanon.
