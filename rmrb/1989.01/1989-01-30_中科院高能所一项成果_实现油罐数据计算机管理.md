The Maoming Petroleum Industrial Company in Guangdong reported to experts on January 21 that they were highly satisfied with the use of the oil tank data management system. This system, developed by the Institute of High Energy Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, is expected to accelerate the automation of oil tank management in China.

Oil fields, refineries, storage depots, and chemical plants are scattered across the country. The Maoming Petroleum Company alone has over 600 oil tanks in its refinery. Managers need to monitor the oil levels and temperatures within these tanks. Previously, data collection was done manually, often involving human measurement, which was not only unsafe but also inaccurate and inefficient. Some refineries had imported American data management systems, but these were expensive and inconvenient to maintain.

The oil tank data management system developed by the Institute of High Energy Physics effectively addresses the issues of measuring liquid levels, temperatures, and calculating oil volumes through computerized management. The report from the Maoming Company indicates that the system is fully functional, with all data displays and printed reports in Chinese, making it user-friendly.

　　中科院高能所一项成果    
    实现油罐数据计算机管理
    本报讯  记者陈祖甲报道：广东茂名石油工业公司１月２１日在此间向专家们递交一份报告，表示了他们使用油罐数据管理系统之后的满意心情。
    这个数据管理系统是由中国科学院高能物理所研制的，它将加速我国油罐管理的自动化。在我国，油田、炼油厂、贮油库及化工厂遍布各地。仅茂名石油公司的炼油厂，就有６００多个油罐。管理人员必须掌握油罐中油量多少及温度高低，以往都是手工采集数据，甚至靠人工测量，既不安全，又不够精确，数据汇集也不及时。有些炼油厂曾经引进美国的数据管理系统，但价格高，维修也不方便。
    高能所研制的油罐数据管理系统，较好地解决了油罐液位、温度的测量和油量计量的计算机管理。茂名公司的报告认为，该系统功能完善，数据显示、打印报表全部汉字化，运用方便。
