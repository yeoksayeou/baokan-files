Title: A "Road Tyrant" Village in Xinchai County

Nearly 100 farmers armed with sticks and shovels blocked passing vehicles and demanded money. This was the scene on December 15, 1988, at around 7 PM, as we passed through Xiaozhang Village in Huanglou Township, Xinchai County, near the provincial highway connecting Zhumadian and Xinchai.

On December 12 of last year, the villagers took advantage of the opportunity to pile soil along the sides of the road for widening purposes. They deliberately piled the soil in the middle of the road, blocking the passage. Then, under the pretext of compensating for their labor in moving the soil, the entire village, including men, women, and children, swarmed onto the road. They forcibly stopped vehicles, demanding 10 yuan per vehicle. If the drivers or passengers did not comply, some villagers would curse at them, and children would occasionally throw objects at the vehicles. Drivers of passenger and cargo trucks, eager to avoid delays, usually complied and paid the money. Over the course of three days, the village intercepted nearly a thousand vehicles, collecting nearly 10,000 yuan. At its peak, vehicles were delayed for over five hours, but no relevant authorities intervened.

　　新蔡县有个“路霸”村
    “站住，不拿出钱谁也甭想过！”近百名农民手持木棍、铁锨，拦截过路车辆要钱。这是１９８８年１２月１５日下午７时，我们经过靠近我省驻（驻马店市）新（新蔡县）公路的新蔡县黄楼乡小张庄时看到的情景。当时公路上已堵住来往的１００多辆车。
    去年１２月１２日，这个村农民借向公路两旁堆土方、准备拓宽公路的机会，故意把土堆在路中间，把通道堵死。然后以出了劳力翻土，应给报酬为由，全村男女老少一起拥上公路，强行拦截车辆要钱，每辆车需交１０元，否则不让通行。稍不如意，一些农民还破口大骂司机和乘客，有的小孩还不时拿东西砸车。急于赶路的客车、货车司机因不愿耽搁时间，大都乖乖地掏出钱。前后３天来，这个村已截车近千辆，收款近万元。严重时，这里堵车时间长达５个多小时，但不见有关部门过问。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　河南汝南县　龚红勇
