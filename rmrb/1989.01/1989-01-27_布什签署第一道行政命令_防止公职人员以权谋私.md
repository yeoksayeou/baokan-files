Bush Signs First Executive Order to Prevent Government Officials from Abusing Power

New China News Agency, Washington, January 25 (Reporter Wu Jin) U.S. President George Bush today signed his first executive order, appointing eight people to form the "Federal Ethics Law Reform Commission." The commission is responsible for reviewing existing government ethics regulations and making recommendations for new regulations to further prevent federal government officials in the administrative, legislative, and judicial branches from abusing their power.

White House Press Secretary Fitzwater said at a press conference that the chairman of the commission is retired former federal judge Malcolm Wilkey, and the vice chairman is former Attorney General Griffin Bell from the Carter administration.

Bush said when signing the executive order, "Reforming and strengthening federal ethics standards is of utmost importance to me and the American people."

Statistics show that during the Reagan administration, over 100 federal government officials were accused of "immoral" or "dereliction of duty" behavior, including then Attorney General Meese and Deputy White House Chief of Staff Deaver. Last year, the Justice Department exposed a nationwide case of officials colluding with businesses to embezzle national funds, involving a group of Defense Department officials. The case is still ongoing and is shocking.

A public opinion poll by American newspapers showed that by the end of Reagan's term, public suspicion of government integrity had significantly increased.

　　布什签署第一道行政命令    
    防止公职人员以权谋私
    新华社华盛顿１月２５日电（记者吴晋）美国总统乔治·布什今天签署第一个行政命令，任命８人组成“联邦道德法规改革委员会”，负责审查现有的政府道德法规，并就制定新法规提出建议，以进一步防止联邦政府行政、立法和司法部门的公职人员以权谋私。
    白宫新闻发言人菲茨沃特在新闻发布会上说，该委员会主席由已退休的前联邦法院高级法官马尔科姆·威尔基担任，副主席由原卡特政府司法部长格里芬·贝尔担任。
    布什在签署这个行政命令时说：“改革和加强联邦道德准则，对我和美国人民来说都是至关重要的。”
    据统计，里根政府执政期间有１００多名联邦政府官员被指控在不同程度上有“不道德”或“渎职”行为，其中包括当时的司法部长米斯和白宫办公厅副主任迪弗。去年司法部门揭露了全国性官商勾结谋取国家资财案，涉及一批国防部官员，该案至今未了，令人触目惊心。
    美国报纸的一项民意测验表明，里根任期结束时，百姓对政府廉洁性的怀疑程度明显上升。
