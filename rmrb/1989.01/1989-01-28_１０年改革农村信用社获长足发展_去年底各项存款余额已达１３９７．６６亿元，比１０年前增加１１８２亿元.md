	Rural Credit Cooperatives Achieve Significant Development Over 10 Years of Reform

	By the end of last year, the total deposit balance reached 139.766 billion yuan, an increase of 118.2 billion yuan compared to 10 years ago.

	Xinhua News Agency reporter Jiāo Rán and People's Daily reporter Jiāng Xià report: Over the past 10 years of reform and development, China's rural credit cooperatives have become a crucial force in supporting the development of rural commodity economies.

	According to statistics, there are now more than 60,000 independent accounting credit cooperatives and over 330,000 credit service outlets nationwide, with a workforce of 750,000. Currently, every township has a credit cooperative, and on average, there is one service outlet for every three administrative villages. By the end of 1988, the total deposit balance of credit cooperatives nationwide reached 139.766 billion yuan, an increase of 118.2 billion yuan compared to 1979. Of this, farmers' savings deposits increased by 106.12 billion yuan, accounting for about one-third of the increase in urban and rural residents' savings deposits over the 10 years of reform.

	According to statistics, from 1979 to 1988, credit cooperatives cumulatively issued 572.6 billion yuan in loans, of which 296.8 billion yuan were for agriculture and 275.8 billion yuan were for township enterprises. In the loans issued by the Agricultural Bank of China and credit cooperatives to rural households and collective enterprises, loans from credit cooperatives accounted for 72%; in loans to township enterprises, credit cooperatives accounted for 52%.

	In supporting the development of the rural economy, the self-financing capabilities of credit cooperatives have been strengthened. By the end of last year, the total equity of credit cooperatives nationwide reached 3.6 billion yuan, a sixfold increase compared to 10 years ago; profits amounted to 1.6 billion yuan, equivalent to nine times that of 10 years ago; self-financing reached 16.7 billion yuan, more than a tenfold increase compared to 10 years ago.

	While supporting the development of the rural economy, credit cooperatives have also contributed to national construction and industrial economic development. By the end of 1988, credit cooperatives had provided the state with over 62.7 billion yuan in funds through reserve funds, standby funds, and deposits, accounting for more than 40% of the total deposits of credit cooperatives. Additionally, credit cooperatives purchased 2.68 billion yuan in national bonds and paid 1 billion yuan in taxes to the tax authorities.

	Shè Běn Yuán, Director of the Credit Cooperative Department of the Agricultural Bank of China, told reporters that entering 1989, credit cooperatives face severe challenges. Due to the inverted interest rates for savings, the long-term high reserve ratio, and the state's excessive withdrawal of funds from credit cooperatives, the number of loss-making credit cooperatives is increasing. Last year, the proportion of loss-making credit cooperatives nationwide increased, with losses amounting to over 400 million yuan. He hopes that relevant departments will not adopt a policy of killing the goose that lays the golden eggs but rather adopt a supportive approach to help credit cooperatives grow stronger, thereby increasing investment in agriculture.

　　１０年改革农村信用社获长足发展    
    去年底各项存款余额已达１３９７．６６亿元，比１０年前增加１１８２亿元
    本报讯  新华社记者焦然、本报记者江夏报道：我国农村信用合作社经过１０年改革和发展，已成为支持农村商品经济发展的一支举足轻重的生力军。
    据统计，全国已有６万多个独立核算的信用社和３３万多个信用服务网点，７５万多人。目前乡乡有信用社，平均每３个行政村就有一个服务网点。到１９８８年年底，全国信用社各项存款余额已达１３９７．６６亿元，比１９７９年增加了１１８２亿元，其中农民储蓄存款增加了１０６１．２亿元，占改革１０年中城乡居民储蓄存款增加额的１／３左右。
    据统计，１９７９年到１９８８年，信用社累计发放贷款５７２６亿元，其中农业贷款２９６８亿元，乡镇企业贷款２７５８亿元。在农业银行、信用社对农户和农业集体企业贷款中，信用社贷款已占７２％；对乡镇企业贷款中，信用社占５２％。
    信用社在支持农村经济发展中，自有资金实力得到增强。到去年底，全国信用社股金已达３6亿元，比１０年前增长６倍；盈利１６亿元，相当于１０年前的９倍；自有资金１６７亿元，比１０年前增长１０倍多。
    在支持农村经济发展的同时，信用社为国家建设、工业经济发展作出了贡献。到１９８８年底，信用社通过准备金、备付金、转存款等形式向国家提供了６２７亿多元的资金，占信用社各项存款的４０％以上。此外，信用社还购买财政债券２６．８亿元，向税务部门交纳税金１０亿元。
    中国农业银行信用合作部主任谢本元对记者说，进入１９８９年，信用社面临着严峻的挑战。由于保值储蓄利率倒挂、存款准备金比例长期居高不下，国家抽走信用社资金太多，使亏损信用社的数量越来越多。去年全国亏损信用社的比重上升，亏损金额达４亿多元。他希望有关部门不要杀鸡取蛋，而应采取扶植的办法，支持信用社壮大，从而增加农业的资金投入。
