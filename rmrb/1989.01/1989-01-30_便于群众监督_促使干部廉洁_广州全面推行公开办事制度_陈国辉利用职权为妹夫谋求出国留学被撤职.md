The Guangzhou Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government have implemented an open office procedure system to better utilize public supervision and ensure that officials at all levels handle matters impartially. According to recent statistics, 911 units in the city have adopted open office procedures, accounting for over 90% of the total number of units that should implement this system.

In the past, due to the secrecy surrounding office procedures in government agencies, the public had to seek "connections" to get things done, wasting time and money. Additionally, the closed nature of the procedures allowed some officials to exploit their positions for personal gain, demanding bribes to expedite or delay matters.

To address these issues, Yuexiu District took the lead in making office procedures transparent. Starting in August last year, the district committee and district government gradually implemented this approach. Now, all levels of party and government agencies in the district have made their office procedures transparent, and the district's five leadership teams are actively exploring ways to make administrative affairs public, making the office procedures transparent. Many cumbersome and redundant procedures have been streamlined, significantly improving efficiency. What used to take several months to complete can now be done in just a few days, much to the public's satisfaction.

The experience of Yuexiu District has been quickly adopted by party and government agencies at all levels across the city. Currently, 29 units at the municipal level, 207 at the district and county levels, and over 670 "seven and eight bureaus" such as industrial and commercial bureaus, tax bureaus, and housing management bureaus have implemented open office procedures.

After these agencies adopted the open office procedure system, every matter handled is subject to relevant regulations, procedures, and conditions, with clear time requirements for each step, all made public for public supervision. Office staff work openly and disclose the results of their work, accepting public supervision. This way, officials handle matters in the open, leaving no room for power abuse, dereliction of duty, or bribery.

Due to the transparency of office procedures, the public has shed their previous mystification of government work and actively exercised their democratic supervision rights. The reporting centers established at all levels of government in the city have received over 1,300 reports from the public in the past half year, with over 70 cases already investigated and prosecuted. The government has recovered over 1.6 million yuan in economic losses and severely punished a number of corrupt officials.

In related news, Chen Guohui, a member of the Guangzhou Municipal Discipline Inspection Commission, was recently dismissed from his post due to abusing his power and falsifying information.

Chen Guohui formerly served as the deputy secretary of the Party Committee and secretary of the Discipline Inspection Commission of the Guangzhou Foreign Trade General Company. In January last year, the public reported that Chen Guohui had abused his power and falsified information, using "deceptive" tactics to transfer his brother-in-law from a certain university to the Guangzhou Foreign Trade System. He also concealed his brother-in-law's graduate degree, falsely claiming that he worked in the office of a certain import-export company under the system, handling computer work, and helped his brother-in-law apply for self-funded overseas study, obtaining an exit visa.

After receiving the public's report, relevant departments of the Guangzhou Municipal Party Committee conducted an investigation and confirmed Chen Guohui's misconduct. It was also discovered that Chen Guohui had violated regulations regarding the transfer and placement of his relatives. The Municipal Party Committee decided to dismiss Chen Guohui from his post and required his brother-in-law to return to his original unit for work arrangements.

Given that the head of the Organization Department of the Guangzhou Foreign Trade General Company did not adhere to principles and accommodated Chen Guohui's unreasonable demands, participating in falsification, the Guangzhou Municipal Discipline Inspection Commission ordered them to make a profound self-criticism in their respective party branches.

　　便于群众监督　促使干部廉洁    
    广州全面推行公开办事制度
    陈国辉利用职权为妹夫谋求出国留学被撤职
    本报广州１月２９日电  记者梁兆明报道：广东省广州市委、市政府为了更有效地发挥群众监督作用，促使各级党政机关干部秉公办事，积极推行公开办事制度。据最近统计，全市已有９１１个单位实行办事制度公开，占应实行公开的单位总数的９０％以上。
    在以前，由于机关单位办事制度神秘化，群众要办一件事，因不明制度规章，不知手续，只有四处“找门路”，花许多冤枉钱不说，而且费时费事。又因过去封闭的办事方式，使一些办事人员得以躲在暗处“设卡”要挟，不给好处不办事，给了好处乱办事。
    针对这些弊端，越秀区率先把办事制度公开化。从去年８月初开始，区委、区政府由点到面推行公开化的做法。现在，全区各级党政机关基本上做到办事制度公开化，区里的五套领导班子也积极探索政务公开路子，使办事制度透明。许多繁琐、重复的办事环节也实行精简，大大提高了办事效率，过去要三几个月才能办成的事，现在几天就能办妥，群众叫好。
    越秀区的经验，很快在全市各级党政机关推广。目前，实行公开办事制度的市一级单位有２９个，区、县一级的有２０７个，工商所、税务所、房管所等“七所八所”有６７０多个。
    这批机关单位实行公开办事制度后，对每一件事的办理，有关规章条文、程序手续，以及需要具备什么条件、每个工作环节的不同时间要求，都一一公诸于众，便于群众监督；办事人员公开身份办公，并将办事结果公开，接受群众监督。这样，干部办事从暗处转到明处，原来弄权、渎职、行贿受贿等违法违纪行为也就无隙可乘了。
    由于办事制度公开化，广大市民一改以往对机关工作的神秘感，自觉行使民主监督权利。全市各级机关相应建立的举报中心，这半年来受理群众举报１３００多宗，其中７０多宗已依法立案，为国家和集体挽回经济损失１６０多万元，严肃查处了一批为政不廉的人。
    又讯　记者梁兆明报道：由于利用职权弄虚作假，广州市纪委委员陈国辉最近被撤职。
    陈国辉原任市外贸总公司党委副书记兼总公司纪委书记。去年１月间，群众举报陈国辉利用职权弄虚作假，采取“瞒天过海”的手法，将其妹夫从某大学调进广州市外贸系统，并隐瞒其研究生毕业学历，谎称他在市外贸系统下属某进出口公司办公室从事电脑工作，为其妹夫办理申请自费出国留学，并领取了出国护照。
    广州市委有关部门接到群众举报后进行调查，证实陈国辉的违纪行为属实，并发现陈国辉在其亲属的工作调动及安排使用方面，也违背了本人应回避的规定。市委决定给予陈国辉撤销职务的处分，要求其妹夫退回原单位安排工作。
    鉴于市外贸总公司组织部负责人不坚持原则，迎合陈国辉的无理要求，参与弄虚作假，广州市纪委责成他们在各自单位的党支部作深刻检讨。
