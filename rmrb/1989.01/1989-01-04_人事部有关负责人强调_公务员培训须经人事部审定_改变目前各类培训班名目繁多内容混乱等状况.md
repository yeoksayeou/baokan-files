	Personnel Department Official Emphasizes:
	Civil Servant Training Must Be Approved by the Personnel Department
	To Change the Current Situation of Numerous and Chaotic Training Classes

	New China News Agency, Beijing, January 3 (Reporter Hu Qinghai) A relevant official from the Personnel Department recently met with reporters and emphasized that at present, all training activities for state civil servants must be approved and recognized by the Personnel Department. No organization, group, or individual may arbitrarily organize civil servant training classes or issue teaching materials and resources related to civil servant training without authorization.

	The official pointed out that currently, some organizations and groups are arbitrarily organizing numerous "civil servant training classes" and publishing books and materials without approval. He said that these "training classes" charge high fees, recruit widely, but the content taught is vastly different from the civil servant system that is being promoted, which will cause confusion in people's minds and is not conducive to the implementation of the civil servant system.

	The official pointed out that civil servant training is a fundamental task of the civil servant system, with a rigorous systematic, scientific, and authoritative nature. It requires national unified planning and management by the Personnel Department, which will organize and implement it according to the relevant regulations of the civil servant system. No organization, group, or individual is allowed to arbitrarily organize such training. Unapproved books and materials must be prohibited from being published and used. He revealed that the Personnel Department will formulate a review method for civil servant training materials.

	The official hopes that all levels of personnel departments will strictly control the situation and, through newspapers, radio, and other media, widely publicize and educate cadres and workers not to participate in various so-called "civil servant training classes" that have not been approved.

　　人事部有关负责人强调
    公务员培训须经人事部审定
    改变目前各类培训班名目繁多内容混乱等状况
    新华社北京１月３日电  （记者胡清海）人事部有关负责人日前约见记者时强调，现阶段凡属国家公务员培训活动，必须经过人事部审定认可，任何单位、团体乃至个人不得擅自举办国家公务员培训班和随意印发与国家公务员培训有关的教材、资料。
    这位负责人指出，现在某些单位、团体擅自举办名目繁多的“公务员培训班”和不经批准随意出书和印发材料。他说，这种“培训班”高额收费，广泛招生，但所授内容与准备推行的公务员制度大相径庭，会造成人们的思想混乱，不利于公务员制度的推行。
    这位负责人指出，国家公务员培训是国家公务员制度中的一项基础工作，具有周密的系统性、科学性和权威性，要由国家统一规划指导管理，由人事部按国家公务员制度的有关条例组织实施，任何单位、团体甚至个人随意组织都是不允许的。未经审核的书籍、材料要禁止印发使用。他透露，人事部将制订对国家公务员培训教材的审核办法。
    这位负责人希望各级人事部门认真把关，并通过报刊、广播广为宣传，教育干部职工不要参加未经批准的各种所谓的“公务员培训班”。
