A scholarly work with practical significance

    Plehanov's three-volume "History of Russian Social Thought" is a renowned academic masterpiece. The first and second volumes were translated and published by Sun Jingong during the early stages of the War of Resistance, but at that time, the country was in turmoil, and the Chinese translation had a very limited print run, so it did not receive the attention it deserved from the academic community. In recent years, the original translator, despite his advanced age and frail health, has diligently revised the translation. After several years of effort, he has completed the full translation of the three-volume work. After being edited by Guo Congzhou, it was published by the Commercial Press. The first volume has already been published, and the second and third volumes will follow soon.

    In May 1909, while residing in Italy, Plehanov received a proposal from the World Publishing House to write a "History of Russian Social Thought," which was something he had long wanted to do but had not yet undertaken. Upon returning to Geneva, he immediately began drafting a plan for the book, revising it several times, which shows his seriousness about this task. To write this book, Plehanov, in addition to purchasing many relevant reference books himself, also utilized the 80,000-volume private library of the famous Russian bibliophile Rubakin, who was then residing in Geneva, thereby obtaining a wealth of valuable materials. According to Plehanov's original estimate, the entire work would require at least five volumes to complete. However, by 1917, when he had just finished the third volume, the February Revolution broke out in Russia. Due to his involvement in intense political activities, he had to temporarily suspend his writing. Unfortunately, the following year, he contracted pneumonia and passed away, never realizing his original plan.

    "History of Russian Social Thought" is a monumental work that closely integrates history and theory. The author, starting from the materialist principle that "it is not consciousness that determines existence, but existence that determines consciousness," meticulously examines the long process of the development of Russian social thought. Through a wealth of historical facts, he convincingly argues how the process of social life development influences the process of social thought development, pointing out that changes in social life lead to struggles between various opposing classes in society, and the more acute the struggle, the faster social thought progresses. As Hegel said, "Contradiction leads to progress." Plehanov believed that before Peter the Great, the driving force behind the development of Russian social thought was the struggle between religious authorities and secular authorities, the struggle between ordinary nobles and great nobles, the struggle between great nobles and clergy, and the struggle between the tsar and the great nobles, among others. All these struggles constitute the magnificent historical panorama of the development of Russian social thought.

    After Peter the Great ascended the throne, in order to fill the national treasury and learn military science and technology from foreign countries, he implemented economic reforms, opening a window to Western Europe, which led to a rapid Westernization of Russian social life. Naturally, this Westernization of social life would also bring about a Westernization of social consciousness. Therefore, later in the realm of thought, there emerged the Westernizers, who advocated learning from the West, and the Slavophiles, who advocated maintaining Russia's backward traditions. The struggle between these two factions had a profound impact on the subsequent development of Russian thought, ultimately leading to the birth of Marxism in Russia.

    Today, as our country is undergoing reforms, the publication of "History of Russian Social Thought" is undoubtedly timely and instructive. It will help us correctly view the struggle between new and old thoughts brought about by changes in social life, thereby enabling us to maintain an optimistic attitude towards the prospects of this struggle.

　　一部有现实意义的学术著作
    郭一民
    普列汉诺夫的三卷本《俄国社会思想史》，是一部饮誉世界的学术名著。该书的第一、二卷早在抗战前夕和抗战初期就由孙静工节译出版，但当时正值全国处于动荡年代，又因为中译本印数很少，所以没有引起学术界应有的重视。近年来原译者不顾年老体弱，潜心移译，历时数载，将三卷本全文译出，经郭从周校订后，交商务印书馆出版。现在第一卷已经问世，第二、第三卷亦将陆续出版。
    １９０９年５月，普列汉诺夫在旅居意大利时，收到世界出版社请他撰写一部《俄国社会思想史》的建议，这也是他多年想做而未做的事。回到日内瓦后，他立即着手制订编写此书的计划，数易其稿，可以看出他对这一项工作的重视。为了写好这本书，普列汉诺夫除了个人添购许多有关的参考书外，并且还利用了当时寓居在日内瓦的俄国著名藏书家鲁巴金的８万本私人藏书，掌握了大量有价值的资料。根据普列汉诺夫原来的估计，全部材料至少要用五卷才能写完，可是当他于１９１７年刚写出第三卷的时候，俄国爆发了“二月革命”，由于参加紧张的政治活动，他不得不暂时中断了撰写工作。不料次年，他感染了肺炎，一病不起，终于未能实现自己预定的计划。
    《俄国社会思想史》是一部史与论密切结合的巨著。作者在书中从“不是意识决定存在，而是存在决定意识”这一唯物主义原理出发，详细地考察了俄国社会思想发展的漫长过程。他通过大量的史实，令人信服地论证了社会生活发展的过程如何影响社会思想发展的过程，指出由于社会生活的变迁，引起了社会各个对立阶级之间的斗争，这种“斗争愈是尖锐，则社会思想的向前发展愈是迅速”，正如黑格尔所说：“矛盾导致前进”。普列汉诺夫认为，在彼得一世以前，推动俄国社会思想向前发展的，是宗教当局和世俗当局的斗争，一般贵族和大贵族的斗争，大贵族和僧侣的斗争以及沙皇与大贵族的斗争，等等。这一切斗争构成了俄国社会思想发展的波澜壮阔的历史画卷。
    彼得一世登基后，出于充实国库和向外国学习军事科学技术的需要，实行经济改革，打开了通向西欧的窗户，使俄国的社会生活发生了急剧的欧化。当然，这种社会生活的欧化，自然不能不同时带来社会意识的欧化。因此，后来在思想领域内产生了主张向西方学习的西欧派和主张维护俄国落后传统的斯拉夫派。这两派的斗争对俄国尔后思想的发展产生了深远的影响，最后导致马克思主义在俄国的诞生。
    今天我国正在进行改革，《俄国社会思想史》的出版，对我们来说无疑是很及时，很有教益的，它将帮助我们正确看待由于社会生活的变化而带来的新旧思想的斗争，从而使我们对这种斗争的前景保持乐观主义的态度。
