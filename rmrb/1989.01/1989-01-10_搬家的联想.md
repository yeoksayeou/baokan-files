	Reflections on Moving House
	Zou Dachai

	I am naturally lazy and dread moving house. However, due to a job transfer, I had no choice but to move. As the saying goes, "You don't know until you move; once you move, you're in for a surprise." When we first got married, we could carry all our belongings in a single trip. Now, after all these years, our furniture, appliances, pots, pans, books, and miscellaneous items fill the entire house. That day, we had to painfully discard the accumulated old clothes, hats, bottles, and jars. What remained filled a truck, which we then moved to our new home. The new house is different, so how do we arrange the things? Thus, my wife and I discussed and argued, debated and then discussed again. For example, she wanted it to be beautiful, while I wanted it to be convenient; I wanted to maintain old habits, while she wanted something new and unique. Eventually, we reached a consensus and began to organize. She took care of the clothes and miscellaneous items, while I sorted through the books and magazines. During the day, we went to work, and in the evenings, we sorted item by item, book by book. For five consecutive nights, we worked until our heads spun, our backs ached, and our bodies were exhausted. But when everything was finally organized, and we looked around the room, we saw that the tables and chairs were shining, and the atmosphere was completely new. There was none of the old clutter and mess, and we felt our spirits lifted, with much of the fatigue dissipating.

	Then I thought of someone who had used the phrase "moving house will cause three days of chaos" to describe the inevitable temporary disorder and conflicts that occur during the reform process, and I found it to be very apt.

	Reform is a systematic project that involves all aspects of social life, naturally much more complex than moving house. But the two do have some similarities. For example, reform also requires discarding old habits and clearing away accumulated dirt to facilitate the development of productivity; it also involves a lot of discussion and even heated debates to reach a better decision; it also makes one tired and sore. Especially now, with the old and new systems running concurrently, it is like the days when the old house is in disarray and the new house is not yet organized. Everything seems chaotic, and one has to make do with makeshift arrangements, such as eating off boxes and sleeping on makeshift beds. It is inconvenient, unfamiliar, and uncomfortable. But since one has to move, there is no way to avoid this step. The only solution is to speed up the process, shorten the days of disorder, and grit one's teeth to get through it. Once this period is over, what awaits is certainly a new environment and order that is incomparable to the past.

	I think that if someone took advantage of the chaos during a move to steal my thermos or umbrella, it would be very easy and difficult to notice. It is said that "looting during a fire" is considered a more serious crime than ordinary theft. The reason is probably that while everyone is busy putting out the fire, someone takes the opportunity to steal, which is more despicable both emotionally and logically. Moreover, chaos provides an opportunity, and if it is not severely punished, it is impossible to control the situation, and it may even lead to looting, causing public and private property to be lost. Therefore, severely punishing those who "loot during a fire" has always been supported by the public. However, I have not heard of "looting during a move" being punished more severely, perhaps because there is no such example in life.

	But in the wave of reform, there are indeed those who take advantage of the reform to seek personal gain and engage in commercial activities using their power. Moreover, due to the historical lessons of policy changes in the past, it has fueled the crazed and urgent desire of some people to "make a fortune" during the current period. They believe that if they can grab something now, and if there is a policy of "not pursuing past offenses" and "not setting a precedent," they will have made a profit. Otherwise, if the policy changes, the opportunity will be lost. Thus, some illegal activities spread like an epidemic: you "speculate," and I "speculate"; you produce counterfeit and inferior goods, and I publish toxic publications; you accept bribes, and I take kickbacks, and so on. Now, while deepening the reform, the central authorities are resolutely addressing these various forms of "looting," which is indeed a key to ensuring the healthy development of the reform. The public cannot help but applaud. Only by severely punishing the few who disrupt economic order can we unite and overcome difficulties together, and soon reach a completely new tomorrow.

### 搬家的联想

　　搬家的联想
    邹达才
    生性懒惰，我最怕搬家。后因工作调动，家不得不搬了。用句套话，“不搬不知道，一搬吓一跳。”刚成家时手拎肩扛的一点家当，现在一拾掇，家具家电，锅碗瓢勺，书籍杂物，挤乱了一屋子。那日积月累的旧衣破帽、瓶瓶罐罐之类，“忍痛”丢弃，留下的装了一卡车，拉来新居。房子不同了，东西如何摆？于是和爱人边议边争，议中有争，争了再议。比如，她要美观，我要方便；我要照顾过去的习惯，她要新颖别致等等。总算趋于一致了，便分头整理。她专管衣服杂物，我收拾书籍报刊。白天上班，晚上回来便一件件、一本本地清理。整整五个晚上，忙得头晕目眩，腰酸背痛。但当整理完毕，环视室内，只见桌椅生辉，气象一新，没有了旧居的臃肿、杂沓，顿感心情舒畅，疲劳也消去了大半。
    于是想起有人曾用“搬家还要乱三天”来比喻改革过程中难免会有局部的、暂时的混乱、撞车现象，觉得实在非常贴切。
    改革是涉及社会生活各个领域的一项系统工程，自然比搬家要复杂得多。但两者确实也有某些相似之处。例如，改革也要丢弃旧衣破帽，扫除陈年积垢，以利生产力的发展；也要议论纷纷，甚至激烈争论，求得较好的决策；也要累得腰酸背痛。特别是当前这种新旧体制交叉运行的情况，恰如旧居已被搞乱、新居还未理好那几天，一切似乎都乱了套，不得不凑着箱柜吃饭，拼起凳子睡觉。不方便，不习惯，不舒服。但既要搬家，又实在避不开这一步。唯一的办法是加快速度，缩短混乱无秩序的时日，咬紧牙关熬过去。只要挺过这一阵，得到的却肯定是往昔无法比拟的新环境、新秩序。
    我想，如果有人乘搬家的一时混乱，把我的暖瓶、雨伞之类顺手拿走，那是极容易也很难被发觉的。据说“趁火打劫”比一般的盗贼要罪加一等。那原因大概在于众人忙于救火，他却乘机偷盗，于情于理都更为恶劣。而且混乱中有机可乘，若不从严惩处，无法控制局面，甚至引起哄抢，使公私财物丧失殆尽。因此，严惩“趁火打劫”者，历来为群众所拥护。不过没有听说“趁搬家打劫”的也要从重处罚，可能因为生活中无此实例。
    但在改革大潮中，钻改革空子以权谋私以权经商者，却确确实实是有的，而且由于过去曾有过政策多变的历史教训，助长了当前某些人“得手为财”的疯狂性、急迫性，以为趁机捞一把，今后若再来个“既往不究”“下不为例”，就赚了。否则，政策一变，时机不再来。于是某些非法活动像瘟疫似的相互感染：你“倒”我也“倒”；你造冒牌劣货，我出有毒书刊；你能收礼，我拿回扣等等。现在，中央在深化改革的同时，坚决治理这种种变相的“抢劫行为”，实在是抓住了保证改革健康发展的一大关键，百姓无不拍手称快。只有严惩少数人破坏经济秩序的行为，才能万众一心，共渡难关，早日到达全新的明天。
