Henan Province Vigorously Carries Out Support for the Military and Preferential Treatment for Military Families

Concern and Support for National Defense Construction Gradually Becomes a New Social Trend

According to Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, January 4th — (Reporter Wang Zhiyun, Correspondent Jiang Hong) Henan Province has vigorously carried out support for the military and preferential treatment for military families. All 134 counties and districts in the province have made decisions to give preferential treatment to active-duty soldiers and veterans. Nearly 40,000 "Military Family Service Centers" have been established. Point-to-point and area-specific services are provided to families of martyrs and military personnel, with tens of thousands of letters and gifts sent to military camps and border posts. This is a result of Henan Province's in-depth national defense education.

Henan Province has been consistently treating national defense education as a strategic task. After the 13th National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the 7th National People's Congress proposed the task of carrying out national defense education nationwide, from the provincial party committee and government to various cities, counties, and townships, national defense education leadership groups or guidance centers have been established. Zhengzhou City, in response to the past phenomenon of "one-time efforts" in education, has established "national defense education bases" in more than 20 public entertainment venues, equipped with retired weapons, martyr memorial halls, and memorials, allowing the public to receive national defense education at any time. Pingdingshan City and Puyang County make full use of party schools at the city, county, and township levels to first focus on national defense education for officials at all levels. Xinye County's 264 administrative villages have established cultural activity centers in each village, equipped with military books, military newspapers and magazines, national defense education gardens, and military sports equipment, integrating education with entertainment, making national defense concepts deeply ingrained in people's minds.

In response to the situation where some young people have a weak sense of national defense, Henan Province has launched the "Building the Great Wall of the 2000 Republic" campaign in urban and rural areas, focusing on national defense education for the younger generation. The province has 57 colleges and universities that have arranged military training courses, and more than 1,500 schools have organized military summer camps. Primary and secondary schools across the province are generally linked with the military, adopting "going out and inviting in" methods to learn military knowledge and continuously strengthen students' national defense awareness.

In-depth and sustained national defense education has made loving the country and supporting the military, caring for and supporting national defense construction gradually become a new social trend. Kaifeng, Xinxiang, Luoyang, Xinyang, and Que Mountain have successively organized inspection teams to assist the military in maintaining military facilities and severely crack down on lawbreakers.

To encourage soldiers to serve in the army with peace of mind, Yexian and Dancheng counties have established organizations or systems to protect the rights and interests of active-duty soldiers and military families. Yanzhou County, which was named an advanced unit for supporting the military and preferential treatment for military families by the Ministry of Civil Affairs and the General Political Department, has established a reserve fund for the preferential treatment of conscripts in the entire county, helping 915 families of active-duty soldiers and 353 veterans to establish 13 economic entities, eliminating the worries of cadres and soldiers. The implementation of various policies and systems has stimulated the enthusiasm of young people to "enlist and learn martial arts." Last year, more than 10,000 students in the province applied for military academies, more than double the previous year.

　　河南蓬勃开展拥军优属工作
    关心支持国防建设逐步形成为新的社会风尚
    据新华社郑州１月４日电  （记者王志耘、通讯员蒋洪）河南省各地蓬勃开展拥军优属工作。全省１３４个县市区作出了优待现役军人和退伍军人的决定，近４万个“军人家庭服务中心”。对烈军属实行定点包干、包片服务，数以万计的慰问信、慰问品寄往军营边防。这是河南省深入开展全民国防教育的成果。
    河南省近年来一直把全民国防教育作为一项战略任务来抓。党的十三大和七届全国人大一次会议提出在全国开展国防教育的任务后，从省委、省政府到各地市县乡，分别成立了国防教育领导小组或指导中心。郑州市针对过去搞教育出现的“一阵风”现象，在全市２０多处公共娱乐场所建立了拥有退役兵器、先烈纪念馆和纪念碑等设施的“国防教育阵地”，使群众随时随地接受国防意识熏陶。平顶山市和濮阳县充分利用市县乡的党校，首先抓好各级党政干部的国防教育。新野县的２６４个行政村，村村建立了拥有军事图书、军事报刊杂志、国防教育园地和军事体育器材的文化活动中心，寓教于乐，使国防观念潜移默化，深入人心。
    针对一些青少年国防观念比较淡薄的状况，河南省城乡开展了“缔造２０００年共和国长城”活动，突出抓好年轻一代的国防教育。全省已有５７所大中学校相继安排了军训课目，有１５００多所学校开展了军事夏令营活动。各地中小学校普遍与部队挂钩，定期和不定期地采取“走出去、请进来”的办法，学习军事，不断强化学生的国防意识。
    深入持久的国防教育使爱国拥军、关心和支持国防建设逐步成为新的社会风尚。开封、新乡、洛阳、信阳、确山等地市县先后组织了纠察队伍，协助部队维护军事设施，严厉打击不法分子。
    为了鼓励军人在部队安心服役，叶县、郸城县等地建立维护现役军人和军属权益的组织或制度。被民政部、总政治部树为拥军优属先进单位的鄢陵县，在全县成立了义务兵优待款储金会，帮助９１５户现役军人家庭和３５３名退伍军人办起了１３个经济实体，解除干部战士的后顾之忧。各项政策制度的落实激发了青年人的“参军习武热”，去年全省报考军校的学生达万余名，比前年增加了两倍多。
