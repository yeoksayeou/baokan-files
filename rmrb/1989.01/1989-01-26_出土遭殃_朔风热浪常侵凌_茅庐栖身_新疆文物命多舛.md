In an era where ancient artifacts are increasingly cherished and admired by society, the thousands of exquisite artifacts from the Xinjiang Cultural Relics and Archaeological Research Institute face an unfortunate fate. Experts and scholars from the Institute have been advocating for years, yet they still find themselves singing the "Song of the Autumn Wind Breaking the Hut."

Established in 1960, the Xinjiang Cultural Relics and Archaeological Research Institute has undergone several changes in its administrative affiliation and has yet to secure a fixed and adequate office space. Currently, nearly 50 archaeologists are crammed into 12 borrowed offices. Artifacts and books are poorly managed and have been piled up in 8 temporary wooden sheds and one dilapidated thatch hut, exposed to the harsh elements and the threat of thieves. If these artifacts could speak, they would surely lament, "Once safely buried underground, now unearthed and suffering misfortune."

These artifacts, highly regarded by domestic and international academic circles, include many national first-class treasures. They are invaluable for studying the ancient civilizations of Central Asia and the Western Regions, and are the fruits of the blood, sweat, and tears of the Institute's staff over the past 30 years. For many years, from the leadership to the scholars, they have repeatedly submitted written reports and verbal appeals to higher authorities, seeking attention to their basic "survival" conditions. While they have garnered sympathy, their difficulties remain unresolved. The archaeologists, confined to their cramped quarters, are more concerned about the fate of the thousands of artifacts connected to their work. They urgently call out: if these treasures were to suffer any loss, they would be letting down both the ancients and future generations!

　　出土遭殃　朔风热浪常侵凌
    茅庐栖身　新疆文物命多舛
    本报乌鲁木齐电  记者曾坤报道：在古文物愈来愈受社会推崇和迷恋的今天，新疆文物考古所数千件文物精品却时运不济。该所专家学者为此奔走呼号多年，至今仍在唱“茅屋为秋风所破歌”。
    成立于１９６０年的新疆文物考古所，隶属关系几经变化，至今没有固定而较为完善的办公地点。眼下，近５０位考古人员硬挤在１２间借来的办公室里。文物和图书资料等无法妥善管理，多年来一直叠罗汉似地堆放在８间临时木板房和一间连煤棚都不如的破茅屋内，任寒暑欺凌及盗贼觊觎。如文物有知，定会发出“昔日深埋地下有保障，如今出土反遭殃”的喟叹。
    这些备受国内外学术界青睐的数千件文物，有许多属国家一级精品，是研究中亚和西域古代文明的无价之宝，也是近３０年来新疆文物考古所全体工作人员血汗的结晶。多年来，从该所领导到专家学者，不断向上级书面报告和口头反映，请求关注其基本“生存”条件，虽引来一片同情，但困难始终得不到解决。身居斗室的该所考古工作者，更关心的是和自己事业相连的数千件文物的命运。他们疾呼：这些精品若稍有闪失，将愧对古人与后代！
