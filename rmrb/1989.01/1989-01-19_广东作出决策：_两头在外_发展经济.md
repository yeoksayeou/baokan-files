Guangdong Makes Decision: "Two Ends Outside" for Economic Development

    BEIJING, Jan. 18 (Xinhua) -- Guangdong Province has decided to seize the opportunity of "one opening" to develop its economy by focusing on external-oriented economic development. This decision was made by the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the provincial government as they deepen the rectification and rectification work.

    The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the CPC and the provincial government believe that Guangdong's advantages and favorable conditions lie "outside" rather than "inside." Guangdong is adjacent to Hong Kong and Macau and was the first province to implement reform and opening-up. Over the past decade, the province has attracted tens of billions of dollars in foreign investment, establishing more than 60 percent of the country's "three types of enterprises" and "three-in-one compensation" enterprises. The export production base system has been initially formed, with a number of export products worth more than $100 million each. The export market has expanded from the traditional Hong Kong and Macau regions to Southeast Asia and Europe and America, and the province's foreign trade exports are at the forefront of the country.

    These are Guangdong's advantages and favorable conditions. However, how to fully utilize them has not been well addressed. Through this round of cleaning and rectification work, officials at all levels in the province have begun to realize that if they do not seize the opportunity of "one opening" and fully leverage their advantages, and do not shift the structure from "two ends inside" to "two ends outside," the conflict with inland regions over the market and raw materials will become more pronounced, and economic development will face more constraints. To find a new path for economic development, the direction of developing an external-oriented economy must be chosen and firmly grasped, and development must be sought through participating in international competition. To this end, the provincial committee and government have put forward an 18-character policy: control construction, adjust structure, promote reform, ensure production, seek efficiency, and improve level.

    At present, various places in the province are adjusting the industrial and product structure according to this 18-character policy, changing the pattern of competing with inland regions for the market and raw materials, and at the same time, vigorously reducing the scale of fixed asset investment. Through efforts, by the end of last month, the province had stopped or delayed 1,220 projects, saving 9.45 billion yuan in investment.

### 广东作出决策：  “两头在外”发展经济

　　广东作出决策：
   “两头在外”发展经济
    本报广州１月１８日电  记者梁兆明报道：紧紧把握住网开一面的机遇，从发展外向型经济中找出路。这是广东省委和省政府在治理、整顿工作不断深化的进程中作出的决策。
    广东省委、省政府认为，广东的有利条件和优势不是在“内”而是在“外”。广东毗邻港澳，又是在改革开放中先走一步的省份。１０年间，全省引进了几十亿美元的外资，办起了占全国６０％以上的“三资”企业和“三来一补”企业。出口生产基地体系初步形成，有了一批出口值达１亿美元以上的“拳头”产品，出口市场从传统的港澳地区逐步扩展到东南亚和欧美等远洋市场，外贸出口走在全国前列。
    这些，是广东的有利条件和优势。但如何充分利用，却一直没有解决好。通过这次清理、整顿工作，全省各级干部开始清醒地看到，如不紧紧把握住网开一面的机遇、充分发挥优势，而不把“两头在内”的结构努力转向“两头在外”，与内地争市场、争原料的矛盾就更为突出，经济发展必将受到更多的制约。要走出经济发展的新路子，必须选准和牢牢掌握住发展外向型经济这个方向，靠参与国际竞争去求发展。为此，省委、省政府提出了１８字方针：压基建，调结构，抓改革，保生产，求效益，上水平。
    目前，全省各地正按照这１８字方针，调整产业和产品结构，改变与内地争市场、争原材料的格局，同时大力压缩固定资产投资规模。经过努力，到上月底为止全省共停缓建项目１２２０多项，压缩投资９４．５亿多元。
