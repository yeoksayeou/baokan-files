The State Supervision Department recently investigated and punished a case of disciplinary violation involving the Commercial Department's Commercial Transport Bureau and the China Machinery Import and Export Corporation. These two units violated national regulations on import approvals, arbitrarily changed the import of trucks, misappropriated state foreign exchange, and illegally imported 117 used dismantled tool cars and other automobile parts for maintenance. The relevant responsible parties have been given administrative disciplinary penalties.

In early June 1986, the Commercial Department's Commercial Transport Bureau submitted a purchase order card and a list of goods for importing three types of truck parts from Japan to the former State Bureau of Materials. After approval, the allocated foreign exchange amount was $400,000. In the spring of 1987, the Commercial Transport Bureau held two bureau meetings to discuss the import of used dismantled tool cars. A director from the Vehicle Management Office suggested that there was remaining foreign exchange from the first half of 1986, which could be used to import used dismantled tool cars. In April 1987, without approval, the Commercial Transport Bureau arbitrarily changed the list of goods and decided to import 126 used dismantled tool cars, 50 agricultural double-row seat small truck cabs, and parts. They formally notified the China Machinery Import and Export Corporation to use the remaining $300,000 in foreign exchange for this import. On May 24, the Commercial Transport Bureau and the China Machinery Import and Export Corporation jointly formed a team to go to Japan and arbitrarily signed four import contracts with Japanese businesses. Later, due to customs inspection, 9 used dismantled tool cars were returned, resulting in the illegal import of 117 cars.

The automobile parts imported by the Commercial Department using state foreign exchange are planned imports. The state regulations stipulate that for planned imports, the relevant regulations of state foreign exchange management must be strictly followed. Once the planned quantity of goods is filled, the remaining foreign exchange must be automatically handed over and cannot be used for other purposes. However, the Commercial Transport Bureau and the China Machinery Import and Export Corporation arbitrarily used foreign exchange, increasing the import amount to $652,100, which exceeded the original approved foreign exchange by 63%.

Relevant department heads pointed out that ignoring orders and prohibitions is a prominent feature of current disciplinary violations. The illegal import of used dismantled tool cars by the Commercial Transport Bureau and the China Machinery Import and Export Corporation is an example of this. For disciplinary violations of ignoring orders and prohibitions, timely and serious investigations and punishments must be carried out. Therefore, the State Supervision Department, in conjunction with the Commercial Department and the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, decided to give administrative demerit and administrative warning penalties to the two deputy directors of the Commercial Department's Commercial Transport Bureau who were responsible for leading the violation. Other directly responsible parties also received administrative disciplinary penalties.

　　监察部查处挪用外汇进口旧车案
    商业部储运局等有关单位负责人及直接责任者分别受到处分
    本报北京１月６日讯  记者舒瑜报道：国家监察部近日查处了商业部商业储运局和中国机械进出口总公司一桩违纪案件。这两个单位违反国家有关进口审批的规定，擅自变更进口货车，挪用国家外汇，违纪进口供维修用的１１７台旧解体工具车及其他汽车部件。有关责任者分别受到了政纪处分。
    １９８６年６月初，商业部商业储运局向原国家物资总局报送了拟进口日本三种型号卡车配件的订货卡片及货单，经审核批准，用汇金额为４０万美元。１９８７年春，商业部商业储运局两次召开局务会，研究进口旧解体工具车事项。车管处一位处长提出，１９８６年上半年国家预拨的外汇还有剩余，可以用来进口旧解体工具车。１９８７年４月，储运局未经报批，擅自变更货单，决定进口１２６台旧解体工具车、５０台农用双排座小卡车驾驶室及部件，并正式函告中机总公司，将剩余的外汇３０万美元全部用于此项进口。５月２４日，储运局和中机总公司共同组成出国小组赴日本，擅自与日商签定４份进口合同。后因海关调查，退掉９台旧解体工具车，实际违纪进口１１７台。
    商业部用国家外汇进口的汽车配件属于国家计划内的进口商品。国家规定，对国家计划内的进口商品，必须严格执行国家外汇管理的有关规定。凡计划内列的商品数量订满后，结余的外汇一律自动上交，不得挪作他用。而商业储运局和中机总公司擅用外汇，使进口金额增加到６５．２１万美元，超过原批外汇６３％。
    有关部门负责人指出，有令不行、有禁不止是当前违纪案件的一种突出表现，商业储运局和中机总公司违纪进口旧解体工具车便是其中一例。对于有令不行、有禁不止的违纪行为，要及时予以严肃查处。为此，国家监察部会同商业部、经贸部研究决定，分别给予负有领导责任的商业部商业储运局两位副局长行政记过、行政警告处分。其他负有直接责任的有关人员也分别受到了政纪处分。
