Edition: 5

Citizen consciousness involves a comprehensive subject that intersects multiple disciplines including jurisprudence, sociology, philosophy, ethics, psychology, and history. It is an indispensable aspect of democratic political construction. The book "Socialist Citizen Consciousness," edited by Huang Dao and Liu Hailiang (published by Liaoning University Press), provides a relatively systematic treatise for studying this subject.

Socialist citizen consciousness is the micro-level manifestation of socialist legal consciousness. Its key characteristics are personal independence, equal status, social democracy, and the unity of rights and duties under the guidance and constraints of the constitution and laws. It centers on clarifying citizens' basic rights and duties, guiding citizens to develop a high level of self-awareness and autonomy as the masters of the state, and ensuring the continuous development of socialist democracy. Therefore, it is a weapon to eradicate feudal hierarchical privilege consciousness and the foundational driving force for socialist modernization ideology.

The book consistently embodies a spirit of active exploration. In discussing the basic concepts, series of basic concepts, specific types of consciousness, and the cultivation of citizen consciousness related to socialist citizen consciousness, it presents its own views on the new social relationships that have emerged and exist in China's primary stage of socialism. For example, it conducts beneficial explorations on issues such as the operators of state-owned, collective, and individual economies; the operational concepts of socialist operators and legal issues in foreign exchanges; the specific consciousness of criminal citizens and the legal status of criminals; and the basic rights and duties of criminals that are legally restricted.

When discussing the development process of China's socialist citizen consciousness, the authors do not discuss its trajectory abstractly, divorced from historical conditions, but rather closely link it to various social factors at the time. For instance, they seriously reflect on the various social roots that led to the dilution, neglect, and suppression of socialist citizen consciousness from the promulgation and implementation of the 1954 Constitution to the end of the Cultural Revolution. Based on this, they discuss the great potential for safeguarding citizens' rights and establishing and developing socialist citizen consciousness in light of the policies of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee. The authors believe that the material foundation for this potential is the continuously developing socialist commodity economy since the implementation of reform and opening up, and the important condition is the continuous improvement of the legal system and socialist legal education through various forms and channels.

In discussing the series of basic concepts, when talking about "opposing any privileges that exceed the constitution and laws," the authors summarize the main manifestations of some people using their power and social status to seek private interests from political, legal, living conditions, and personnel relationships perspectives. They also explore measures to eliminate privileges based on actual situations.

The book does not merely satisfy itself with general theoretical exploration and knowledge introduction but focuses on practicality. In addition to maintaining the practicality of citizen practice in the discussion, to highlight practicality, the authors also separately list a section on "Cultivating Citizen Consciousness," proposing to popularize citizen consciousness education. They suggest opening a "Citizenship" course in middle schools and conducting multi-channel national legal education to create a good social environment.

　　《社会主义公民意识》评介
    傅兆龙
    公民意识是涉及法学、社会学、哲学、伦理学、心理学和历史学等多种学科交叉融合的综合性课题，是民主政治建设中一个不可或缺的重要方面。由黄稻、刘海亮主编的《社会主义公民意识》（辽宁大学出版社出版）一书，为研究这一课题提供了一部比较系统的论著。
    社会主义公民意识是社会主义法律意识在微观上的表现形态。其重要特性是人格独立、地位平等、社会民主、权利与义务的统一，在宪法与法律指导和约束下的自由。它以明确公民的基本权利与义务为核心内容，引导公民树立作为国家主人的高度自觉和自主精神，以保障社会主义民主的不断发展。因此，它是肃清封建等级特权意识的武器，是社会主义现代化思想动力的基础。
    本书始终贯穿着一种积极的探索精神。在社会主义公民意识的基本观念、基本观念系列、特定意识类举、培养公民意识的论述中，就我国社会主义初级阶段所产生和存在的新的社会关系，提出了自己的见解。例如对国营经济、集体经济、个体经济的经营者；作为社会主义经营者的经营观念与国外交往中的法律问题；犯罪公民的特定意识以及罪犯的法律地位；罪犯享有的被依法限制的公民基本权利和被依法限制的公民基本义务等问题进行了有益的探索。
    该书论述我国社会主义公民意识的发展历程时，作者不是脱离历史条件，抽象地谈论它的轨迹，而是紧紧联系当时的各种社会因素。如对１９５４年宪法颁布实施到“文革”结束这一段时间，之所以淡化、漠视、扼制社会主义公民意识的各种社会根源进行了认真的反思。在此基础上，联系党的十一届三中全会以来的方针政策，论述了保障公民权利，建立和发展社会主义公民意识的极大可能性。作者认为，这种可能性的物质基础是实行改革开放后不断发展的社会主义商品经济，其重要条件是法制的不断健全和通过各种形式和渠道进行的社会主义法制教育。
    在论述基本观念系列中，谈到“反对任何超越宪法和法律的特权”时，作者对于一些人仰仗手中的权力和所处的社会地位，谋取私利的主要表现，从政治上、法制上、生活待遇上、人事关系上进行了概括，并从实际出发，对于消除特权的措施进行了探讨。
    本书并不满足于一般理论的探索和知识的介绍，而是着眼于实用性。除了在论述中坚持公民实践的针对性外，为了突出实用性，作者还独列“培养公民意识”一编，提出要普及公民意识教育，并建议在中学开设“公民”课程，同时多渠道地进行全民普法教育，以造成一个良好的社会环境。
