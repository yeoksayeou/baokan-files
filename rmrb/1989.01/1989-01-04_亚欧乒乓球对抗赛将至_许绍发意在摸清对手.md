This competition will first take place in Shah Alam, Malaysia, Singapore City, and Hong Kong for the team events, followed by singles matches in Bangkok, Thailand. The Chinese male athletes selected for the Asian team are Jiang Jialiang, Chen Longcan, and Teng Yi. The female athletes are Chen Jing and Li Huifen. The coaches are Xu Shao Fa and Zhang Xiaolin. Li Furen will attend the competition as a representative of the Asian Ping Pong Union. Before departure, Xu Shao Fa told reporters, "Our athletes only began training in mid-December, so the training time is short, and they are not currently in their best condition. Of course, we will strive to win matches, but the main goal is to observe if there have been any new developments in Asia-Europe Ping Pong techniques and to prepare for the 40th World Table Tennis Championships."

　　亚欧乒乓球对抗赛将至
    许绍发意在摸清对手
    新华社北京１月３日电  参加第四届亚欧乒乓球对抗赛的中国运动员今天启程。
    这届比赛先在马来西亚的沙加、新加坡城、香港举行团体赛，接着在泰国曼谷举行单打比赛。入选亚洲队的中国男选手是江嘉良、陈龙灿、滕毅，女选手是陈静、李惠芬。教练员是许绍发和张燮林。李富荣作为亚乒联盟的代表出席这次赛会。许绍发在临行前对记者说，我国运动员１２月中旬才开始集中，训练时间太短，目前不是处在最佳状态。参加比赛当然要争取赢球，但主要目的是看亚欧乒乓球技术有无新的发展，为参加第四十届世界乒乓球锦标赛做准备。
