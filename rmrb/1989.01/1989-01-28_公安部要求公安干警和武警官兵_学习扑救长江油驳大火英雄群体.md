The Ministry of Public Security has issued a notice to public security organs in all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, deciding to launch a campaign across the nation's public security system and armed police forces to learn from the heroic group that battled the Yangtze oil barge fire.

On January 2, 1989, an unprecedented oil barge fire occurred on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River in Wuhan. The entire contingent of firefighters from the Wuhan Public Security Fire Brigade, in order to rescue state property and protect the Yangtze River's navigation and the safety of Wuhan's people, braved extreme difficulties, risked their lives, and fought valiantly. They wrote a moving song of socialist spiritual civilization with their blood and lives, and were awarded the title of "January 2 Firefighting Heroic Group" by the Wuhan Municipal People's Government.

The Ministry of Public Security believes that the firefighters who participated in the battle against the Yangtze oil barge fire put the interests of the state and the people first. To protect the country's economic construction and the people's lives and property, they fearlessly fought. Their heroic deeds have resonated deeply in the hearts of the people of Wuhan, Hubei Province, and the entire nation. Every public security officer and armed police soldier should, like the martyrs who sacrificed their lives in the fire, have a lofty ideal, prioritize the interests of the state and the people, be loyal to their duties, and diligently perform their jobs.

The Ministry of Public Security stated in the notice that the heroic group that battled the Yangtze oil barge fire, when the state's property and the people's interests were seriously threatened, knew the dangers ahead but still volunteered to fight, bravely advancing forward. They dared to fight tough and difficult battles, not hesitating to sacrifice their blood and lives to protect the state and the people's interests. All public security officers and armed police soldiers should be ready, like the heroic group, to make sacrifices for the Party and the people at any time, even to the point of giving their precious lives.

The Ministry of Public Security pointed out that the current social security situation remains severe, and sudden incidents can occur at any time. All levels of public security organs and armed police forces must, like the heroic group, maintain strict organization, discipline, and vigilance, so that when incidents occur, they can be quickly and appropriately handled.

The notice also mentioned that the members of this heroic group, in the face of the oil barge explosion and life-threatening situation, put the hope of survival in the hands of others and left the threat of death for themselves. Many comrades first thought of their fellow soldiers' safety, and even after being seriously injured, they resolutely jumped into the cold river to rescue others. This selfless spirit in times of danger is highly commendable and worthy of emulation.

Today, Vice Minister of Public Security Hu Zhiguang also introduced the heroic deeds of the heroic group that battled the Yangtze oil barge fire to the capital's news agencies and thanked the capital's news agencies for their extensive coverage of this heroic group.

　　公安部要求公安干警和武警官兵    
    学习扑救长江油驳大火英雄群体
    本报北京１月２７日讯  记者吴恒权报道：公安部向各省、市、自治区公安机关发出通知，决定在全国公安系统和武警部队中广泛开展向扑救长江油驳大火英雄群体学习的活动。
    １９８９年１月２日，武汉长江上游发生罕见的原油驳船大火。湖北省武汉市公安消防支队全体参战干警，为了抢救国家财产，保卫长江航运和武汉人民的安全，在极端困难的条件下，舍死忘生，赴汤蹈火，齐心协力，顽强拚搏，用鲜血和生命谱写了一曲催人泪下的社会主义精神文明的壮歌，被武汉市人民政府授予“‘１·２’抢险扑火战斗英雄群体”称号。
    公安部认为，参加长江油驳大火扑火战斗的消防干警把国家和人民的利益放在第一位，为保卫祖国经济建设和人民生命财产，置生死于度外，英勇奋战。他们的英雄行为，在武汉市、湖北省乃至全国人民心中激起了强烈的反响。每一个公安干警和武警战士，都要像救火中牺牲的烈士那样，胸怀崇高理想，以国家和人民的利益为重，忠诚于自己的职责，兢兢业业地做好本职工作。
    公安部在通知中说，参加长江油驳大火扑火的英雄群体，在国家财产、人民利益受到严重威胁的时候，明知面临艰险，仍争相请战，勇往直前，敢打硬仗、恶仗，不惜以鲜血和生命保卫国家和人民的利益。全体公安干警和武警战士要像英雄群体那样，随时准备为党和人民做出牺牲，直至献出自己的宝贵的生命。
    公安部指出，当前社会治安形势仍然严峻，突发事件随时都有可能发生。各级公安机关和武警部队都要像英雄群体那样，严密组织，严格纪律，加强戒备，以便事件发生时，能迅速妥善地予以处置。
    通知还说，这个英雄群体的干部、战士，他们在油驳爆炸、面临生死考验的紧要关头，把生的希望让给别人，把死的威胁留给自己，许多同志首先想到的是战友的安危，有的身负重伤还毅然跳进冰冷的江水援救别人，这种在危难时刻舍己为人的高尚风格，很值得发扬光大。
    公安部副部长胡之光今天还向首都新闻单位介绍了扑救长江油驳大火英雄群体的英雄事迹，感谢首都新闻单位对这一英雄群体进行的广泛宣传。
