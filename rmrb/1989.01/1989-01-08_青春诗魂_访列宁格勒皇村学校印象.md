The Spirit of Youth: A Visit to the Imperial Lyceum in Pushkin

	“A small, slender black child with curly hair, eyes sparkling with light, as quick and lively as mercury, full of passion—this is how the students and teachers of the Lyceum saw Pushkin.”

	In an article discussing Pushkin's literary achievements, Lunacharsky described the young Pushkin, radiating the light of youth. Pushkin was selected by Tsar Alexander I to study at the Lyceum, a school specifically designed to train statesmen. At the time of his enrollment, he was only 12 years old, and he spent an unforgettable six years in this special school.

	The Lyceum is located near the picturesque Catherine Palace on the outskirts of Leningrad. On the day of our visit, the overcast sky of Leningrad suddenly cleared, and the autumn sun shone brightly and warmly over the vast, fertile Russian countryside. Leisurely and peaceful cattle and sheep grazed in threes and fours on the freshly harvested fields. Near and far, clusters of forests, sometimes dense, sometimes sparse, presented a dazzling array of colors under the early autumn sun—dark green, fiery red, deep purple, bright yellow, blue-green... all interwoven and shimmering, like brocade and clouds. From any angle, they formed a captivating picture reminiscent of Levitan or Shishkin. And in the depths of the shade, there stood the Lyceum that nurtured Russia's great poet.

	The person who greeted the Chinese writers' delegation and provided us with explanations was a slender, pretty Russian woman in her early thirties. She smiled warmly, her eyes clear and bright. She first asked us to wear large slippers over our shoes to prevent outdoor dust from entering the clean exhibition hall. As she explained, she led us to visit the grand hall where the opening ceremony was held, the library, the books Pushkin had read, the manuscripts, pencil drawings, and cartoons of him and his classmates, as well as the handwritten poetry collections they compiled. We also saw the classrooms where they had their lessons, the oval-shaped desks, and the swords and helmets used during fencing classes. Everything was arranged neatly and spotlessly clean. The dormitories were upstairs, with long corridors on both sides, each student having a small room with a bed, a small cabinet, and a small desk. On the desk in the room where Pushkin had stayed, a book was still spread open, as if the young poet had just left. Obviously, the specially selected students who came here to study were well taken care of, and their living and learning conditions were meticulously arranged.

	Under the enthusiastic guidance of this lecturer who frequently recited Pushkin's poems, we gained a vivid understanding of this great poet who had shown extraordinary talent in his youth.

	This aristocratic school was undoubtedly unique. Tsar Alexander I established it to cultivate "pillars of the state" for his empire. It was said that only one batch of carefully selected students was admitted every two or three years. When Pushkin enrolled, only 30 students were selected. The teachers were naturally the most learned scholars of the time, such as the famous Derzhavin and Zhukovsky, who were not only his teachers but also admirers of his talent and friends. However, the Tsar never imagined that, contrary to his wishes, it was in this school that a group of rebellious Decembrists and great poets with free spirits emerged. In the year Pushkin graduated, he wrote the famous "Ode to Liberty," in which he openly wrote: "I will sing of freedom to the whole world, and denounce the evil on the throne. 'World tyrants, tremble! And you, fallen slaves, take courage, gather your strength, rise up!'"

	This situation seems quite peculiar. However, according to the lecturer, many of the teachers and scholars who ran the Lyceum at that time were enlightened liberal and enlightened thinkers, some of whom came from France. A teacher who was particularly fond of and respected by Pushkin was the brother of the famous French revolutionary Marat. The school rules required students to treat everyone equally, including respecting the servants in the school, and they were not allowed to shout at them, otherwise, they would be punished. Among the books they read, many were works by outstanding thinkers of the French Enlightenment, such as Diderot, Voltaire, and the Russian scholar Lomonosov. From the records of students' grades at that time, Pushkin's grades in mathematics and drawing were not high, but literature and history always received high marks. Interestingly, the teachers did not mind this, but fully respected the students' interests. Only those who scored high in a particular subject had the right to sit in the front row during that class, while those with lower scores had to sit in the back. During mathematics classes, Pushkin naturally had to sit in the back row, but he was happy to immerse himself in his poetic thoughts in the back row, and the teacher did not interfere. At that time, the enlightened educational philosophy was that students should be allowed to fully develop their interests because that was what they pursued, and forcing them to learn subjects they disliked or had no interest in would not yield good results. Obviously, the children liked these teachers with their liberal spirits. In their clumsy cartoons, they playfully teased their teachers and boldly mocked the stern inspectors who lectured in the classroom. It was said that the 12- or 13-year-old young Pushkin had already shocked his teachers and classmates with his brilliant poetry. He was undoubtedly the leader of their poetry, and thus he edited their handwritten poetry collection. Some classmates even believed that Pushkin's poetry was so beautiful because a spirit whispered to him.

	No one would have thought that when the tyranny of Arakcheyev began to rage, this specially cared-for Lyceum turned out to be a paradise. Here, the atmosphere was warm, friendly, and liberal, filled with a group of joyful, passionate, and unrestrained young people. Historical coincidence made Pushkin grow up in this wonderful environment, "immediately occupying a fairly high position on the steps that predecessors had walked." These six years became the happiest and most unforgettable time in Pushkin's short life.

	At the age of 12, when Pushkin entered the Lyceum, he was a young, gentle, and naive boy, eager to enjoy life and happiness. When he graduated and appeared before the world, he was a great poet with a rich cultural education, a brave, unbridled, and free-spirited soul. A star of genius, shining with charming charm and youthful radiance, rose in the sky of Russian literature.

	We, the delegation, expressed our deep gratitude to the enthusiastic and friendly lecturer. Zhang Shouren, the deputy editor of the October magazine, took out the "Selected Lyric Poems of Pushkin" brought from distant China and presented it to her. Her clear and bright eyes shone with joy as she took the book with both hands and made a request: she hoped we could recite a lyric poem by Pushkin on the spot. We unanimously chose Jia Mai, who had clear pronunciation and a loud voice, to undertake this request that was hard to decline. Thus, in the spacious corridor of the Lyceum, the famous poem "To Chaadaev" was recited, which many people could recite by heart:

	“In that wondrous moment,
	I saw you again,
	Like a fleeting phantom,
	Like a spirit of pure beauty…”

	The enthusiastic female lecturer was so excited that her face turned a little red. She said, "Although I don't understand Chinese, the rhythmic sounds of your recitation still move me so much."

	Indeed, the lingering echoes of reciting Pushkin's beautiful poems seemed to still resonate in the spacious corridor and in the hearts of each of us…

　　青春诗魂
    ——访列宁格勒皇村学校印象
    唐挚
    “一个身材小巧挺秀的黑孩子，卷发，眼睛里闪着亮光，像水银一样灵活好动，满腔热情。——这便是皇村学校的同学和教师所看到的普希金。”
    卢那察尔斯基在他的一篇论述普希金文学成就的文章中，对少年时期焕发着青春光芒的普希金作了这样的描写。普希金被沙皇亚历山大一世选拔到专门培养国务活动家的皇村学校来学习，入学时，年仅１２岁，在这所特殊的学校里他渡过了难忘的六年。
    这所皇村学校地处列宁格勒近郊风景如画的叶卡杰琳娜宫附近。我们去访问的那天，多云的列宁格勒天空，豁然开朗，秋阳明丽而温暖地照耀在广阔、肥沃的俄罗斯原野上，闲适安详的牛群、羊群，三三两两地在刚刚收割过的田野上漫游。远远近近，成团成簇，忽疏忽密的森林，在初秋的阳光下，呈现出异常斑斓的色彩，墨绿、火红、绛紫、明黄、青蓝……全都斑驳摇曳地交织在一起，如锦如霞，无论从哪个角度去看，都构成了列维坦或史楚金笔下迷人的图画。而浓荫深处，就是培育了俄罗斯伟大诗人的皇村中学了。
    迎接中国作家代表团和为我们讲解的，是一位身材瘦小，面目娇好，约三十几岁的俄罗斯妇女，她面含微笑，双目清澈而有神，首先请我们用一双大拖鞋套在鞋上，以免把户外的尘土带到洁净的展览馆中。她一面讲解，一面领着我们参观了举行开学典礼的大厅、图书室、普希金当年阅读过的种种书籍，他和他的同学们的手稿、铅笔画、漫画，以及他和同学们编写的手抄诗集，还有上课时的教室，那一排排椭圆形的课桌，和他在上击剑课时所用过的剑和盔，这一切都布置得井井有条、纤尘不染。楼上则是学生们的寝室，长长的走廊两侧，每人占一小间，有床、小柜和小桌。而普希金居住过的那间书桌上，还摊开着一本书，仿佛年轻诗人刚刚离去不久。显然，来这里就读的特选学生是备受照顾，生活与学习也都是精心安排的。
    在这位充满热情，讲解时不断背诵出普希金诗句的讲解员的介绍中，我们对这位少年时代就显露了非凡才华的伟大诗人，有了许多生动的了解。
    这所贵族学校，无疑是很特殊的。沙皇亚历山大一世建立它，是要为他的帝国培养“栋梁之材”。据说每隔三年或两年才招收一批精选子弟，普希金入学时，就只选了３０人。老师自然都是当时的博学多才之士，如著名的杰尔查文和茹科夫斯基，既是他的老师也是他才华的赞赏者和忘年交。然而，沙皇绝没想到，和他的愿望相反，正是在这所学校中，出现了一批具有叛逆精神的十二月党人和具有奔放自由心灵的伟大诗人。在普希金毕业那一年，他写下了著名的《自由颂》，诗中公然写着：“我要对全世界歌唱自由，声讨那皇位上的恶人。”“世间的暴君，去发抖吧！而你们，倒下的奴隶们，鼓起勇气，集中精神，奋起吧！”这情况似乎相当奇特。但是，据讲解员告诉我们，当时主持皇村学校的老师和学者们，有许多是具有开明的自由主义、启蒙主义精神的思想家，其中有些来自法国，一位特别为普希金喜爱和尊敬的老师，就是法国著名革命家马拉之弟。学校校规中要求学生平等待人，包括尊重学校中的仆役，对他们不得大声呵斥，否则将受到惩处。在他们所读的书籍中，不少是法国启蒙运动的卓越思想家，如狄德罗、伏尔泰以及俄国大学者罗蒙诺索夫等人的著作。从当时记载学生成绩的表格中，普希金的数学、图画课的分数都不高，唯独文学、历史始终占有高分。有趣的是，对此老师并不以为意，而是充分尊重学生的兴趣，只是在听课时，凡这门课取得高分的学生，有权坐在前排，分数差的就只能坐在最后排了。每逢数学课时，普希金当然只有屈居后排，但他乐得在后排沉醉于他诗歌的构思中，老师也并不干预。那时开明的教育观点认为，应该让学生充分发展他的兴趣，因为这是他所追求的，而勉强他学习他所厌恶或不感兴趣的课程，并不会有什么好的结果。显然，孩子们喜欢他们这批具有自由主义精神的老师们，他们在自己稚拙的漫画中，善意地揶揄他们的老师，而又大胆地嘲笑道貌岸然、在课堂宣讲的督学。据说年仅十二、三岁的少年普希金，当时已经以他才华四射的诗歌震惊老师和同学们了，他无疑是他们诗歌的领袖，因此由他主编了他们手抄的诗集。而有的同学则在漫画中认为，普希金诗写得那么美妙，是因为有个精灵在他耳朵边偷偷教他。
    谁都不会想到，当阿拉克切耶夫的专横暴政开始猖獗起来的时候，这个被特殊照顾的皇村中学，竟是一个世外桃园，这里洋溢着的是温暖的、友好的、自由主义的教学空气，是一群欢乐的、热情的、无拘无束的青少年们。历史的机遇，竟使得普希金在这个绝妙的环境中熏陶成长起来，“使他立刻在前人走过的阶梯上占据了一个相当高的等级。”这六年，成为普希金短促一生中最幸福最难忘的时光。
    １２岁的普希金，当他踏入皇村学校时，是一个年轻、温柔、沉醉于生活，准备享受幸福的天真的、机伶的少年，而当他毕业告别皇村学校时出现在世人面前的，是一个拥有雄厚的文化教养、具有勇敢的、不羁的、奔放的自由灵魂的伟大诗人，一颗天才的、闪耀着迷人魅力和青春光芒的星辰，升上了俄罗斯文学的天空。
    我们代表团向热情亲切的讲解员，表达了我们深深的谢意，《十月》杂志副主编张守仁拿出从遥远的中国带来的《普希金抒情诗选集》，赠送给她。她那清澈有神的眼睛闪射出了喜悦的光芒，用双手接过了书，同时提出要求：希望我们能当场为她朗诵一首普希金的抒情诗。我们一致推举口齿清楚、声音洪亮的乔迈承担这个难以推托的请求，于是在那高大宽敞的皇村学校的走廊上，响起了许多人都会背诵的那首著名诗篇《致凯恩》：
    “在那美妙的一瞬，
    我重又看见了你，
    有如昙花一现的幻影，
    有如纯洁之美的精灵……”
    热情的女讲解员兴奋得脸有些发红了，她说：“我虽不懂汉文，但你们朗诵的铿锵音节，仍多么使我激动呵。”
    确实，朗诵普希金美丽诗篇的余音似乎仍在宽大的走廊上缭绕不绝，也在我们每个人的心上缭绕不绝……
