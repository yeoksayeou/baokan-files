China's superconductivity research is making in-depth progress and remains at the forefront globally. However, experts have pointed out that this research has entered a crucial stage, and the superconductivity community is facing some common challenges.

The Superconductivity Technology Expert Committee and the National Superconductivity Technology Joint Research and Development Center recently reviewed the progress of superconductivity research by participating units across the country.

In recent years, China has made significant progress in the preparation of superconducting thin films. Researchers have mastered multiple new processes and methods for preparing thin films, achieving high-quality superconducting thin films. The yttrium-barium-copper-oxide thin films they prepared can carry a maximum current of up to 106 amperes per square centimeter in the liquid nitrogen temperature range, which is close to the current highest level internationally. The Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Chemistry has preliminarily prepared superconducting thin films using chemical synthesis methods, innovating in the process.

The sintering of bulk superconducting materials is another key focus for Chinese experts. Researchers have produced bismuth-based and thallium-based superconducting materials with zero resistance temperatures stably reaching around 100 K, with the highest exceeding 110 K. The yttrium-barium-copper-oxide and bismuth-strontium-calcium-copper-oxide superconducting materials developed by eight units, including the Institute of Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Shenyang Institute of Metal Research, Peking University, and the Beijing Nonferrous Metals Research Institute, can carry currents of over 1000 amperes per square centimeter, with the highest critical current density reaching 2000 amperes per square centimeter. Researchers have also explored processes such as rolling tapes and extruding wires, achieving initial success. This has created certain conditions for the practical application of superconducting materials.

It is understood that Chinese researchers are exploring the mechanisms that hinder the improvement of current density in bulk superconducting materials, both theoretically and practically, and have proposed new academic insights. Some have directly observed the pinning effect on improving current density for the first time, proposing the relationship between reverse domains and critical current density; others believe that current density is related to the cleanliness of grain boundaries, grain structure, and material composition standards. Recently, Chinese scientists have used a scanning tunneling microscope to capture atomic-level resolution images of the surface structure of superconductors, aiding in the deeper microscopic study of superconducting structures.

In the application of superconductivity, the superconducting quantum interference devices developed by the China Institute of Metrology and other institutions can be used to measure weak human biological magnetic fields and the magnetic permeability of magnetic materials. The superconducting magnetic shielding cylinders produced by the Northwest Nonferrous Metals Research Institute, Fudan University, and Central South University each have their unique features, with some reaching the latest international standards. Researchers at Nanjing University, after developing a superconducting high-frequency detector, have also conducted feasibility studies on superconducting microwave switches. Relevant officials have stated that China has preliminarily formed a joint research team for superconductivity, possessing certain strengths in the intense international competition. Currently, they are seeking new breakthroughs.

　　我国超导研究仍处世界前列
    攻坚阶段遇到某些共同难题
    本报讯  记者陈祖甲报道：有关专家日前说，我国的超导研究正朝着深入的方向取得进展，仍然处于国际前列地位。但他们也指出，这项研究已进入攻坚阶段，超导学术界遇到了一些共同的难题。
    超导技术专家委员会和国家超导技术联合研究开发中心去年底检查了全国参加攻关单位超导研究工作的进展。
    近年来，我国超导薄膜的制备方面进展较大。研究人员掌握了制备薄膜的多种新工艺和新方法，获得了高质量的超导薄膜。他们制备的钇钡铜氧薄膜，在液氮温区能够通过的最大电流量已达到每平方厘米１０6安培的量级，与国外目前的最高水平相近。中国科学院化学所用化学合成方法已初步制备成超导薄膜，在工艺上有所创新。
    烧制超导块状材料是我国专家的一个主攻方向。研究人员制成的铋系和铊系超导材料，其零电阻温度稳定地达到１００Ｋ左右，最高的超过１１０Ｋ。中科院物理所、沈阳金属研究所、北京大学、北京有色金属研究总院等８个单位研制的钇钡铜氧和铋锶钙铜氧超导材料，每平方厘米通过的电流量达到１０００安培以上，最高的临界电流密度可以达到２０００安培／平方厘米。研究人员还在轧制带材、挤压线材等方面作了探索，新工艺已有成效。这为超导材料的实用化创造了一定条件。
    据了解，我国研究人员正从理论及实践上对障碍提高块状超导材料电流密度的机制作了探索，提出了新的学术见解。有的第一次直接观察到钉札现象对提高电流密度的影响，提出反向畴与临界电流密度的关系；有的则认为电流密度与晶界的干净程度、晶粒结构以及材料成分标准有关。最近，我国科学工作者用扫描隧道显微镜，拍到了原子级分辨率的超导体表面结构照片，有助于从微观的更深层次上研究超导的结构。
    在超导应用方面，中国计量科学研究院等研制的射频超导量子干涉器，能用来测量微弱的人体生物磁场和磁性材料的磁导率。西北有色金属研究院、复旦大学、中南工业大学等单位制作的超导磁屏蔽筒各有特色，有的达到国际最新水平。南京大学的研究人员在制作超导高频检测器之后，又对超导微波开关的可行性作了论证。有关负责人表示，我国已初步形成一支超导联合攻关的科技队伍，在激烈的国际竞争中具有一定的实力。目前正在寻找新的突破口。
