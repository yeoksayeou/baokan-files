The deepest impression an outsider takes from a country is the pain he feels there. I felt that in the city of Kragujevac in Yugoslavia.

The brutality of the Nazis vented all its fury on this gentle little city. The entire city became a vast graveyard, burying seven thousand people who were massacred. That is the heavy memory I took away. But it is a beautiful memory. Whenever someone mentions Yugoslavia, I think of Kragujevac, and of the moment when the enemy slaughtered the people there, I think of the bravery of the entire nation.

— Sartre

A cold wind. A bitter rain. The sky darkens. The earth darkens.

The elderly, the young, and the children, in groups, surge towards the green hillside—where on October 21, 1941, 300 children were collectively slaughtered by the Nazis.

The Yugoslavian novelist Moma Dimic holds an umbrella for me, and we walk and talk along the narrow mountain path.

“Since 1945, every October 21st, tens of thousands of people from all directions come to Kragujevac to mourn the 300 children killed by the Nazis,” Moma tells me.

A long ceremony, officials' speeches, laying of flowers, people bowing their heads in mourning. Isn't it all the same old routine? I didn't say it out loud. The rain is pouring, the wind is cold. I pull up the hood of my coat.

“Why did the Nazis choose Kragujevac—”

“Kragujevac.”

“Kragujevac. Why did the Nazis choose this small city to kill people?”

“Kragujevac is the center of our Serbia. They killed children, teachers, priests, workers, carpenters, small shop owners, shoemakers… all were simple, hardworking townspeople.”

“Why?”

“The Nazis wanted to exterminate us! Even the boys, they left none! The children were taken straight from their classrooms, and so were about a dozen teachers. One teacher, the Nazis wanted him to cooperate. He said, ‘Shoot! I am giving my children their last lesson!’”

The rain pours down. On the mountain path, people under umbrellas lower their heads, like pilgrims, walking up the mountain. The path seems endless, the people unending.

“Seven thousand people!” Moma continues. “All killed in one day! The corpses dyed the ground red over 350 acres. Every year on this day, we come here to commemorate them. Poets, painters, sculptors, playwrights, actors, musicians—artists of all kinds, using various art forms to commemorate them. Look!” Moma points ahead. We turn a bend on the winding mountain path, and see a giant white V-shaped stone sculpture standing on the hillside. On one side of the stone sculpture is a large patch of color—the children wearing red, green, and yellow raincoats; on the other side is a dark patch—the choir in black cloaks; and another patch of blue—the orchestra in blue uniforms.

“The V-shaped stone monument represents the class of the murdered children—the fifth grade,” Moma says. “The children were killed by the Nazis right here.”

People fill the hills and valleys. The human tide continues to flow down the mountain path. The vivid colors of the white stone sculpture spread out—children keep coming. They are standing where 47 years ago, 300 children made their last cry: “Dear Papa and Mama!”

“Hualing, come with me!” Moma takes my arm and leads me to two elderly people standing at the front of the crowd. Their hair is white, their faces solemn, gazing steadily at the V-shaped stone monument shrouding the valley. “These are the only two survivors,” Moma introduces the two elderly people to me.

I am dazed for a moment, tightly grasping their hands. The old people's eyes are vacant, as if the scenery before them no longer exists, and they have returned to the world of half a century ago.

The people on the ground have aged; those underground are still children. But at this moment, they are together again.

History, reality, in the rain, merge—into a picture that is sad and beautiful, real and absurd.

“They are all famous actors and musicians in Yugoslavia,” Moma points to a few people walking towards the loudspeaker.

The rain falls harder. The orchestra starts playing music. A female actor recites a poem by the famous Yugoslavian poet Desanka:

	…
	They sat at their desks
	Just 55 minutes before the fatal moment
	Little people,
	Eagerly answering
	Difficult questions:
	If a person walks, the result is how much…
	Many such questions.
	Little brains full of numbers;
	Schoolbags stuffed with exercise books,
	Grades good and bad;
	Pockets filled with dreams and secrets,
	Love and vows.
	Everyone thought
	They would run in the sunshine
	For a long time, a very long time
	Until the task is completed.

	…
	Poem after poem, chorus after chorus, short operas, in two hours, present the brutal history of half a century ago before our eyes. No long ceremonies, no dull speeches, no angry cries, no empty slogans. The children's yearning for the future, their joy in life, their fear of death, their calls to their parents, the parents' grief and accusation at the loss of their children, the Serbians' resistance to violence and their tenacity for freedom—generations of the voices of “people,” in the rhythm of poetry and music, echo through the clouds, resonate through the valley. The echoes linger in the pouring rain. Heaven and earth mourn with the people. The Serbians of Yugoslavia express their historical sentiment in this way every year: no hatred, no anger; only sadness, only memory, only warning: the world must never again have war and slaughter.

I can't help but think of the Nanjing Massacre. The “Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall” is also at the site where the Japanese army collectively slaughtered Chinese people. Outside the hall is a large expanse of stones. Each stone represents a victim. Inside the hall are exhibits of the Japanese army's slaughter, documents, photos, newspapers. A rusty iron bucket, used by the Japanese army to pour gasoline on the corpses. An elderly mother did not find her son's body, but found this bucket. The Japanese army raped more than twenty thousand women in a month, including girls as young as thirteen and old women—they are all naked in the photos. A young woman named Ji Xiuying practiced martial arts; the Japanese army threatened to rape her but failed, stabbed her 37 times, thinking she was dead. Someone found her with blood bubbles in her nostrils and saved her. Two Japanese soldiers competed to kill people, whoever killed 100 people first would win. They killed and killed, both reaching 100 people. But no one knew who reached the goal of killing 100 people first. Kill 150 more! The Japanese army killed 240,000 people in Nanjing!

This is historical fact. But how many Chinese people remember? How many people in the world know? What the Chinese people present is just a cold memorial hall, without emotion, without a message for the future. People are forgetful. Not holding a grudge is right. But, we must not forget.

“Hualing!” Moma points to two tombstones by the roadside. “Look at these two children!” The memorial service has ended. We are walking back in the rain with the crowd. “A boy and a girl, a pair of young lovers, were killed by the Nazis right here.”

Two bright red flowers in front of the tombstones, shining in the rain.

We, about 60 writers, from many regions of the world, were invited to Yugoslavia to discuss “Exile and Literature.” All the writers saw and were affected by the half-century-old history reenacted in the Kragujevac valley. History is heavy. Reality? Cold, hungry, damp. The host Moma takes us to the local cultural center for lunch.

Steaming Serbian tea (the Yugoslavians call it “tea,” but it is actually warmed Serbian brandy), hot beef soup, delicious roasted lamb. Eat, drink, talk—the people are lively. Only one person did not eat, drink, or talk, sitting there with a thoughtful expression. That was the West German writer Minherbe.

Angel writes a poem at the table. He writes the first line:

	Black is too bright here…

	Moma asks him to speak. He says he has never seen any nation use such strong and beautiful artistic language to repeatedly tell the world such a brutal history, and he is very moved, moved to the point of wanting to write poetry. Other writers speak one after another. The Israeli writer talks about the Nazis' persecution and slaughter of the Jews. The Soviet poet says that when the Nazis occupied his hometown, he was only 4 years old, and it is a miracle that he survived and became a poet; poets must stand up together and speak: “Never slaughter again.”

	The three writers from mainland China are also present. Yang Xu stands up to speak: “I come from Nanjing. In 1937, when the Japanese army entered Nanjing, there was a massacre that shocked the world. The victims of that massacre numbered 240,000! We also built a Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall in Nanjing. In 1937, I was 5 years old. As a child, I was a survivor of that massacre. Today, I fully understand the emotions of the Yugoslavians in front of the victims. I noticed: today's ceremony has many young people and teenagers. We adults should be responsible to the children: never have war again.”

	The West German writer Minherbe slowly stands up. He heavily pronounces a long list of Nazi concentration camps, including the Auschwitz concentration camp that I and Angel saw in Poland. He also says: “…I have a sense of guilt: I feel that I killed those children. We are simply beasts! All concentration camps must be destroyed! I am grateful that you allow me to be with you…”

	He cannot continue, sits down, and covers his face to cry.

	Another writer speaks, and then the Japanese want to speak.

	“…The Nanjing Massacre is a fact. But, please do not forget: we also have the Hiroshima atomic bomb, and a piece of silence.”

	Angel whispers to me: “I want to ask him three questions: Have the Chinese invaded Japan? Have the Chinese slaughtered Japanese civilians? Did the Americans drop bombs on Japan before the attack on Pearl Harbor? They started the war! They killed first!” Angel then asks me if he should stand up to refute him.

	“No need. He and that West German friend are a good refutation.”

	Minherbe is still crying with his hands covering his head. Angel and I walk over to shake his hand. Many people walk over to shake his hand.

	“A real man!” Angel says to him in German. Angel's ancestors are from the Black Forest in Germany.

	The most touching part of the Kragujevac bloody tragedy is the scraps of paper left by those who were slaughtered. In their last few minutes, on small pieces of paper or on their IDs, they wrote their last words to their loved ones. The handwriting is blurred, the sentences may not be coherent, but they express naked love, naked wishes:

	(Grade 6 student of the First Middle School) Dear Papa and Mama, this is the last time—Rubisa

	(Grade 6 student of the Second Middle School) Papa, I and Misso are in the old barracks. Send us food, and work clothes and blankets. Send some jam, Papa. Go find the principal. If it is useful, send some things for us to eat. Mama. Uncle Peter is also here. Send him three packs of cigarettes and some paper—Bafal

	(Deputy Principal of the First Middle School) My dearest, dearest Mela, kiss the children for me, listen to Mama, take good care of yourself, goodbye, I love you, your father—Raisa October 21, 1941

	(Worker) Goodbye, Misa, I died today. Goodbye, my dearest, my last thought is of you, my son will be happy even without a father. Goodbye—Smich

	(Worker) Papa, Mama, children, brothers, sisters, and Ratanjka, goodbye—Radisha

	(Innkeeper) My dear children, Mairi and Andra and Merisa and Miso and my dear family, your father leaves a message, goodbye, I am dying, God bless you, your father—Dil

	(Shoemaker) Dear wife, perhaps we will never see each other again, be filial to Mama, listen to her, take care of our children, always be happy, your loving Dergolu

	(Worker) Children, avenge your father—Stefan

	(Carpenter) Dear, please take care of the children, never leave them, goodbye—Nameless

	(Priest) Goodbye, all my relatives, my dearest, I am dying, although I am innocent. Forever yours, Andra

	(Bookstore Owner) Don't send bread tomorrow—Jakov

	(Vegetable Vendor) Dear wife, Foka, take good care of the children, work hard in the store. You and the children are blessed by heaven. Educate them as much as possible. Goodbye—Nameless

	(Worker) My dearest, Lujica, in this last moment, forgive me for everything, I leave 850 yuan, love you, Bajza

	(Worker) Dear Lila, Seka, Barda. This is the last moment. Forgive your father. Kiss all of you, Laza. Lila, I wanted to take a few photos with you, you didn't want to. I'm sorry.—Nameless

	(Surviving Worker) Dear Boreika, take good care of Misa, find her a good husband, greet Papa, ask him to also find, love you, Bajzida

### 亲爱的爸爸妈妈——三百个孩子最后的呼唤

专栏：

　　亲爱的爸爸妈妈
    ——三百个孩子最后的呼唤
    聂华苓
    一个外国人从一个国家带走的最深刻的印象是他在那儿感到的痛苦。我在南斯拉夫的克拉库耶伐次感觉到了。
    纳粹的残酷将其所有的愤怒发泄在这个温和的小城。整个城成为一座巨大的坟墓，埋葬七千被残杀的人。那就是我带走的沉重记忆。但是个美丽的记忆。无论何时，只要有人提起南斯拉夫我就想起克拉库耶伐次，和那儿被敌人杀戮的那一刻，我就想起整个民族的英勇。
                             ——萨特
    凄风。苦雨。天昏。地暗。
    老年、青年、孩子们，一群群涌向那青青山坡——那儿就是１９４１年１０月２１日３００个孩子被纳粹集体残杀的地方。
    南斯拉夫小说家莫马·迪密其为我撑着雨伞，我们在窄窄的山路上边走边谈。
    “自从１９４５年起，每年１０月２１日，成千上万的人从四面八方来到克拉库耶伐次悼念被纳粹杀死的３００个孩子。”莫马告诉我。
    冗长的仪式，官员演讲献花，人们垂首悼念。又是那老一套吧？我没有说出口。好大的雨，好冷的风。我拉起大衣的罩帽。
    “纳粹为什么要选克拉——”
    “克拉库耶伐次。”
    “克拉库耶伐次。纳粹为什么要选这个小城杀人呢？”
    “克拉库耶伐次是我们塞尔维亚的中心。他们杀孩子、老师，也杀牧师、工人、木匠、小店老板、鞋匠……全是纯朴勤劳的小市民。”
    “为什么呢？”
    “纳粹要灭种呀！甚至于男孩子一个也不留！孩子们就从课堂里被抓走，还有十几位老师。有一位老师，纳粹要他合作。他说：‘开枪吧！我给孩子们上最后一课！’”
    雨哗哗地下。山路上的人，在伞下低着头，朝圣一般向山上走。走不完的人。望不断的路。
    “七千多人呀！”莫马继续告诉我。“一天之内，全杀光了！尸首染红了３５０多英亩。每年这一天，我们到这儿来纪念他们。诗人，画家，雕刻家，剧作家，演员，音乐家——各种艺术家，用各种艺术作品来纪念他们。你看！”莫马指着前面。我们在蜿蜒的山路上一拐弯，只见一座巨大的白色Ｖ形石雕屹立山坡上。石雕一边有一大片色彩——穿红红绿绿的雨衣的孩子们；另一边有一抹黑——披黑披风的合唱团；还有一抹天蓝——穿蓝制服的乐队。
    “那Ｖ形石碑象征被害孩子们的班级——五年级。”莫马说：“孩子们就在那儿被纳粹杀死。”
    人已满山满谷。人潮仍沿着山路泻下。白色石雕边鲜烈的色彩一抹一抹漫开去——孩子们仍不断涌来。他们正站在４７年前３００个孩子发出最后一声呼唤的地方：“亲爱的爸爸妈妈！”
    “华苓，跟我来！”莫马挽起我手臂，带我到站在人群最前面的两位老人面前。他们头发斑白，脸色肃穆，定定望着笼罩山谷的Ｖ形石碑。“这是两位仅有生还的孩子。”莫马向我介绍那两位老人。
    我恍惚了一下，紧紧握住他们的手。老人眼神木然，仿佛眼前的景物已不存在，他们又回到半世纪前的世界中去了。
    地上的人已老；地下的仍是儿童。但在这一刻，他们又在一起了。
    历史，现实，在雨中融合了——融成一幅悲哀而美丽、真实而荒谬的画面。
    “他们全是南斯拉夫著名的演员和音乐家。”莫马指着几个走向扩音器的人对我说。
    雨下得更大了。乐队奏起了音乐。一位女演员朗诵南斯拉夫当今著名女诗人迪桑卡的诗：
    ……
    他们坐在书桌前
    就在那要命时刻前５５分钟
    小小的人儿，
    急切地回答
    艰难的问题：
    假若一个人步行，结果是多少……
    许许多多这类问题。
    小脑子充满了数字；
    书包装满了练习簿，
    打的分数有好也有坏；
    兜儿还塞一把梦想和秘密，
    是爱和盟誓。
    每个人都以为
    自己将在阳光下奔跑
    很久，很久
    直到任务了结时。
    ……
    一首首诗，一段段合唱，一幕幕短歌剧，在两小时之内，将半世纪前的残酷历史呈现在我们眼前。没有冗长的仪式，没有沉闷的演讲，没有愤怒的疾呼，没有空洞的口号。孩子们对未来的憧憬，对生命的喜悦，对死亡的恐惧，对亲人的呼唤，父母失子的哀伤和控诉，塞尔维亚人对暴力的反抗和对自由的执著——世世代代“人”的声音，在诗和音乐的韵律中，响彻云霄，响遍山谷。回音在倾泻的雨中缭绕不绝。天地亦与人同哀。南斯拉夫的塞尔维亚人就那样子年年不断表达他们的历史感：没有仇恨，没有愤怒；只有悲哀，只有记忆，只有警告：世间永远不能再有战争和屠杀了。
    我不由想起南京大屠杀。“南京大屠杀纪念馆”也在当年日军集体屠杀中国人的地点。馆外一大片石子。每颗石子象征一位牺牲者。馆内陈列着日军屠杀的证据、文件、照片、报纸。一个生锈的铁皮水桶，日军用来在尸体上浇汽油。年老的母亲没找到儿子尸体，却找到这个水桶。日军在一个月内强奸两万多妇女，有十几岁的女孩，也有老妇人——她们在照片上全是赤裸裸的。一个叫季秀英的年轻女子，练过气功；日军威胁强奸未成，刺了３７刀，以为她死了。有人发现她鼻孔冒血泡，才把她救活。两个日本兵比赛杀人，谁先杀死１００人谁就是赢家。两人分头杀、杀、杀，都杀了１００人。但是没人知道谁先达到杀死１００人的目标。再杀１５０吧！日军在南京杀死２４万人！
    这是历史事实。但是，多少中国人记得呢？多少世界上的人知道呢？中国人所展现的只是一座冰冷的纪念馆，没有感情，没有未来的信息。人，是健忘的。不记仇。很对。但是，不能忘记。
    “华苓！”莫马指着山路边两座墓碑，“你看这两个孩子！”纪念会已散。我们正顺着人潮淋着雨往回走。“男孩、女孩，一对小情人，就在这儿被纳粹杀死了。”
    墓前两把血红的鲜花，在雨中闪闪发光。
    我们一共６０几位作家，从世界许多地区应邀在南斯拉夫讨论“放逐与文学”。所有的作家都看到和感染到克拉库耶伐次山谷中重现的半世纪前一段历史。历史是沉重的。现实呢？冷、饿、潮。主人莫马带我们去当地文化中心吃午饭。
    热腾腾的塞尔维亚茶（南斯拉夫人称为“茶”，其实是暖过的塞尔维亚白兰地），滚烫的牛肉汤，鲜美的烤羊肉。吃、喝、谈——人们热闹起来了。只有一个人没吃、没喝、没谈，坐在那儿，一脸沉思的神情。那就是西德作家明赫白。
    安格尔在餐桌上写诗。只见他写下第一行：
    黑色在这儿也太明亮了……
    莫马请他讲话。他说从没见过任何民族用如此强烈而优美的艺术语言将如此残酷的历史一再告诉世人，他非常感动，感动得直想写诗。其他作家纷纷发言。以色列作家讲纳粹对犹太人的迫害和残杀。苏联诗人说，纳粹占领他家乡时他只有４岁，他能活过来，并且成为诗人，是个奇迹；诗人必须一起站起来讲话：“永远不要屠杀了。”
    中国大陆也有３位作家在座。杨旭站起来说话了：“我从南京来。１９３７年，日本军队攻进南京时，有一场震惊世界的大屠杀。那一场屠杀受害者有２４万人！我们在南京也建立了一座南京大屠杀纪念馆。１９３７年，我５岁。作为一个孩子，我是那一场大屠杀的幸存者。今天我对南斯拉夫人在受害者前所表现的感情，完全理解。我注意到：今天的仪式上有许多青年和少年。我们这些大人应该对孩子们负责：永远不要有战争了。”
    西德作家明赫白缓缓站起来了。他沉重地一个一个字地说出一大串纳粹集中营，包括我和安格尔在波兰看到的奥斯威辛集中营。他还说：“……我有犯罪感：感到是我杀害了那些孩子。我们简直就是兽！所有集中营都必须粉碎！你们允许我和你们在一起，我非常感激……”
    他说不下去了，坐下来掩面哭泣。
    另一位作家讲话之后，日本人也要讲话了。
    “……南京大屠杀是事实。但是，请不要忘记：我们也有广岛原子弹，也有一片沉静。”
    安格尔低声对我说：“我要问他三个问题：中国人侵略过日本吗？中国人屠杀过日本老百姓吗？美国在日本进攻珍珠港之前扔过炸弹吗？他们先发动战争！他们先杀人！”安格尔接着问我是否应该站起来反驳他呢？
    “不必了。他和那位西德朋友一对照，就是很好的反驳。”
    明赫白仍然双手撑着头流泪。我和安格尔走过去和他握手。许多人走过去和他握手。
    “一条好汉！”安格尔用德文对他说。安氏祖先是德国黑森林人。
    克拉库耶伐次血腥悲剧中最感人的，是那些被残杀的人留下的片纸只字。他们临死前几分钟，在小纸片上，或在身份证上，给亲人写下最后几个字。字迹模糊，句子也许不通，却表达了赤裸裸的爱、赤裸裸的心愿：
    （第一中学六年级学生）亲爱的爸爸妈妈最后一次了——鲁比沙
    （第二中学六年级学生）爸爸，我和密索在旧军营里。给我们送饭来，也要工装裤和毯子。送点果酱来爸爸去找校长假若有用送点东西给我们吃吧。妈妈彼得舅舅也在这儿。给他送三包烟还要些纸——巴法尔
