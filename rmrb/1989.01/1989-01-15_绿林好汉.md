The term “forest guardians” does not refer to heroes who gather in the forests, but rather to individuals who, over more than a decade, have dedicated their lives and blood to protecting 6,400 acres of lush black pines and thriving acacias.

Some say he is a fool: the hills are covered with trees and grass, yet when his own firewood runs out, he doesn’t touch a single blade of grass or tree on the mountain. Instead, he carries a sack to collect dry cow dung for fuel.

Others say he is a stern “black-faced” man. If anyone harms the village’s trees, it’s as if they’ve torn out his heart, and he will not let them off.

In the autumn of 1982, his nephew secretly cut a few bundles of tree branches. Just as he was carrying them out of the ravine, he was stopped by the guardian.

“Uncle, you’re the one watching over the mountain. I’m your nephew after all. Can’t you just look the other way and let me pass?”

“No way! If I let you go, how can I manage others? We’ll handle this according to the village rules!”

His nephew tried every trick, but his uncle wouldn’t budge. In the end, he had to pay the fine.

Last year, one day, he went up the mountain for a patrol. He saw four tree stumps lying there, and his anger flared up instantly. He didn’t eat or drink, following the trail for over 10 miles. Finally, he found four logs hidden in a pile of firewood in someone’s backyard. It turned out to be his granddaughter’s sister’s family. Beforehand, the sister and brother-in-law had planned to take advantage of the opportunity to invite him to dinner to cut a few trees, hoping to deceive him.

“For the sake of our relationship, can you overlook this one time? Don’t be angry, old man. Come to my place and have some wine.”

He snapped, “Don’t try that. If you’re a man, you have to give me face. No matter what, we have to deal with this.” He insisted on pulling the trees back to the village and fined them.

Last spring, the village head’s son was caught digging up tree stumps by him. He brought both the person and the items to the village committee. As soon as he entered, he confronted the village head: “Your son was digging up tree stumps. Now I’m handing him over to you to deal with.” The village head publicly criticized his own child, counted the tree stumps—more than ten—and compensated according to the regulations. The basket and pickaxe were also confiscated.

This steadfast “forest guardian” is Du Shangbin, a man over sixty from Wapengyao Village, Linglongta Township, Jianchang County, Liaoning Province, known as “Black Face.”

The village officials entrusted the forest to Du Shangbin with confidence, and most of the villagers supported him. However, there were also those who resented him. His newly budding cotton was cut, his newly sprouted corn was chopped, his newly flowering beans were pulled, and someone even threatened to get rid of him...

Du Shangbin was hurt and shed tears: “I’m on the verge of dying, why bother with this!”

After crying, he thought a lot...

He remembered that 10 years ago, on this barren hill, the old party secretary led the entire village, young and old, to plant 80 acres of pine trees. A severe drought killed all the saplings. They planted and replanted, and finally, nearly a million black pines and acacias took root here. People looked forward to them growing, and the task of protecting the forest was entrusted to him. This was such a great trust!

Thinking of this, Du Shangbin made up his mind: Destroying my family’s things is fine, but harming the collective’s trees, I will not forgive! I will live to guard the mountain, and even in death, I will be buried on the mountain!

He guarded the mountain day and night, often sleeping fully clothed. Sometimes when he was ill, he would bring his drip to the guardhouse to make medicine. During the New Year and festivals, while others were with their families, he went patrolling the mountain. In rain and snow, the mountain was high and the roads were slippery, but he never stopped. The county opera troupe performed six consecutive days in the village, and this opera lover didn’t go to see a single show. During the New Year and festivals, when villagers went to the mountain to pay their respects, Du Shangbin was afraid of fire, so he went to check and stomp out any remaining embers.

Now, Wapengyao Village’s forest is lush with trees and grass covering the ground. The mountain, the forest, everywhere has the shining gaze of Du Shangbin...

　　“绿林好汉”
    汪如海　王胜利
    这位“绿林好汉”，并不是啸聚绿林的草寇英雄，而是十多个寒暑中，用自己的生命与心血，护卫６４００亩墨绿的黑松和茁壮的刺槐的护林员。
    有人说他是傻子：满坡的树遍坡的草，自家灶下断柴时，却不动山上一草一木，整天背条口袋去捡干牛粪烧；
    有人说他是不开面的“黑脸”，谁要祸害村里的树，就像摘了他的心肝，绝不放过。
    １９８２年秋天，他外甥偷着砍了几捆树枝，刚扛出沟口就让他堵住了。
    “大舅，您是看山的，我好歹也是您外甥，抬抬手放我过去吧！”
    “不行！放了你，我咋管别人？按村里的规矩办！”
    外甥左磨右泡，见舅舅就是不改嘴，只好乖乖地交了罚款。
    去年有一天，他孙女女婿请他吃饭。饭前，他上山转了一遭，看见有４个树脑袋在那躺着，心里的火腾地一下就蹿上来了。他饭没吃酒没喝，沿着踪迹走了１０多里路，终于在一户人家后院的柴草垛里找到了４根檩子。原来这是他孙女女婿的姐姐家。事前这姐弟俩合计好了，借请他吃饭的机会砍几棵树，满打算能糊弄过去。
    “看在咱们爷们面上，就饶过这回吧。您老人家别生气了，还是上我那儿喝酒吧。”他孙女女婿边求情边往屋里推他。他急了，“别来这套。是爷们就得给我长脸，说出天花也得处理。”立逼着把树拉回村里，还罚了钱。
    去年开春，村主任的儿子上山刨树疙瘩被他抓住，连人带物一齐带到村委会。一进门，他就“将”了村主任一“军”：“你儿子刨树疙瘩了，现在交给你处理。”这位主任当众批评完自己的孩子，又数了数树疙瘩——十多个，便按规定赔了钱，还被没收了筐篓和镐头。
    这位堂堂的“绿林好汉”就是辽宁省建昌县玲珑塔乡瓦盆窑村林场年过花甲、人称“黑脸”的杜尚斌。
    把林场交给杜尚斌，村干部们放心，多数群众拥护。可也有人嫉恨。他家刚吐蕾的棉花被人割过，刚出穗的玉米让人砍过，刚扬花的豆子让人拔过，甚至有人扬言要把他整死……
    杜尚斌伤过心流过泪：“眼瞅着要进棺材的人了，还扯这个干啥！”流完泪，又想了很多……
    他想起，１０年前，在这片荒山秃岭上，老支书领着全村男女老少种了８０亩松树，一场大旱，树苗全死了。死一茬再栽一茬、种一茬！终于，近百万株黑松、刺槐在这里扎下了根。人们盼着它们长大，把护林的任务交给了自己，这该是多么大的信任啊！
    想到这儿，杜老汉把心一横：糟踏我家啥东西都行，祸害集体树木我决不轻饶！我活着要看山，死也要死在山上、埋在山上！
    他日夜守护在山上，经常是合衣而眠。有时犯病，就把药吊子拿到看山房熬药。过年过节别人合家团圆，他却去巡山。雨天雪天，山高路滑连跟头带把式也不间歇。县评剧团在村里连唱６天大戏，他这个戏迷心里不知咋刺痒，也没去看一场。过年过节村里人们进山上坟，杜老汉怕失火，那儿上完坟都去看一看，把余火踩灭。
    如今，瓦盆窑村林场绿树成林，柴草遮人。这山，这林，到处有杜尚斌老汉闪灼的目光……
