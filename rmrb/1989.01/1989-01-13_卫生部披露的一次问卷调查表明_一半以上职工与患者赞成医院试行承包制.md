The Ministry of Health has revealed a survey indicating that over half of the staff and patients support the trial of a contract system in hospitals. Today, at the 1988 research report meeting of the Ministry of Health's Policy and Management Research Expert Committee, it was disclosed that a survey conducted in 18 hospitals in Guangdong, Hubei, Beijing, and other regions showed that 58% of hospital staff believe that implementing the contract system is "good," 19.5% think it is "can be done or not done," and 22.5% think it is "not good." Among patients or their families, about 3/4 support hospitals implementing the contract system, while 25.6% oppose it. This reflects that the current exploration of hospital contracts is in progress, with a majority leaning towards "feasible at present," but the emerging issues cannot be ignored.

Among these 18 hospitals, there are 6 provincial-level (including affiliated schools) hospitals, 6 municipal-level hospitals, 4 county (district)-level hospitals, and 2 township-level hospitals. Except for one specialty hospital, all are general hospitals (including 4 traditional Chinese medicine hospitals). There are 3 collective-owned hospitals and 15 state-owned hospitals. Five hospitals started the contract system before 1984, while the rest began in 1987. A total of 1519 questionnaires were collected, categorized by hospital staff (medical, nursing, technical personnel, party and government cadres, and logistics personnel) and patients or their families (public-funded, labor insurance, self-paying).

The content of these hospitals' contracts is not purely economic but generally revolves around the responsibility system, integrating technical tasks, service quality, service attitude, hospital management, and economic indicators, with quality indicators accounting for the highest proportion.

Regarding the question of whether the contract system has motivated hospital staff and enhanced cohesion, 78.4% of hospital staff believe it has.

Regarding the question of whether the contract system better meets the medical and health needs of the masses, 78% and 71.5% of hospital staff believe it helps alleviate "difficulty in seeing a doctor" and "difficulty in being hospitalized." 64.3% and 55.3% of patients feel that outpatient services are more convenient than before, and the situation of difficulty in being hospitalized has somewhat improved. 86.6% of patients believe that the medical quality has improved after the contract system, and 87% are satisfied with the service attitude of medical and nursing staff.

The main issues reflected by patients are increased examinations, higher diagnosis and medication costs. 41.8% of self-paying patients, 29.5% of public-funded patients, and 30.6% of labor insurance patients find this "hard to accept." Some patients exclaim that "money is more important than life," fearing that medical staff may prioritize economic considerations, affecting technical performance and medical quality.

Hospital party and government cadres believe that the main current issues are unclear contract concepts, imperfect mechanisms, and unmatched systems. 81% believe that social part-time jobs will affect the normal work order of the hospital, reduce cooperation, and promote a tendency to be petty. Some suggest not using the term "contract" and instead using "responsibility system."

Medical staff reflect that the contract system does not reflect the value of intellectual labor and has not solved issues such as "inverted brain and body." Medical staff after the contract system work overloaded, and their endurance has a certain limit. 42.4% believe that the contract system is not conducive to the improvement of professional skills, as the reason is that during the day they work overloaded, in their spare time they engage in revenue-generating activities, and there is no time to read and study; going out to study affects bonuses and labor income; leaders care more about short-term economic benefits and neglect talent cultivation; due to economic needs, sending out and receiving students for study is very rare; treating patients emphasizes quantity over quality, which can easily lead to hasty treatment.

### 卫生部披露的一次问卷调查表明  一半以上职工与患者赞成医院试行承包制

　　卫生部披露的一次问卷调查表明
    一半以上职工与患者赞成医院试行承包制
    本报北京１月１２日讯  记者艾笑报道：今天，卫生部政策与管理研究专家委员会在１９８８年课题报告会上披露了有关医院承包的一次调查。这次在广东、湖北、北京等地１８所医院进行的意向问卷调查表明，医院职工认为推行承包制“好”的占５８％，认为“可搞可不搞”的占１９．５％，认为“不好”的占２２．５％；患者或家属中约３／４赞成医院搞承包，反对的占２５．６％。这反映当前对医院承包尚处在探索中，倾向“当前可行”的占多数，而出现的流弊不容忽视。
    这１８所医院中，省级（含部属院校）医院６所，市级医院６所，县（区）级医院４所，乡镇级医院２所。除一家专科医院外，都是综合性医院（其中４所中医院）。３所为集体所有制，１５所为全民所有制。１９８４年前开始承包的有５所，其余大部分始于１９８７年收回问卷１５１９份，按医院工作人员（按医护技人员、党政干部和后勤人员），患者或家属（按公费、劳保、自费）分别统计。
    这些医院的承包内容不是单纯经济性的，一般都围绕责任制，把技术任务、服务质量、服务态度、医院管理和经济指标综合纳入，其中质量指标所占比分最高。
    对“承包是否调动了医院职工的积极性、增强了凝聚力”的问题，７８．４％的医院工作人员认为“是”。
    对“承包是否较好满足了群众的医疗保健需要”的问题，有７８％和７１．５％的医院职工认为这有利于缓解“看病难”和“住院难”；有６４．３％和５５．３％的患者感到看门诊比过去方便，住院难的状况比过去有所缓解；患者中８６．６％认为承包后医疗质量提高，８７％对医护人员的服务态度满意。
    患者反映的主要问题是检查多了、诊病和药费贵了。４１．８％的自费病人、２９．５％的公费患者和３０．６％的劳保待遇者对此表示“难以接受”。有的患者惊叹“钱大于命”，担心医务人员过多考虑经济，会影响技术发挥和医疗质量。
    医院党政干部认为当前的主要问题是承包概念不清、机制不完善、体制不配套。８１％的人认为社会兼职会影响医院正常工作秩序，协作精神差了，斤斤计较的风气抬头。有人主张不用“承包”二字，改用“责任制”好。
    医务人员反映，承包没有体现知识分子劳动价值，也未解决“脑体倒挂”等分配不公现象。医务人员承包后超负荷劳动，承受能力总有一定限度。４２．４％的人认为承包不利于业务技术的提高，原因是白天超负荷，业余搞创收，没时间看书学习；外出学习影响奖金和劳务收入；领导关心近期经济效益多，忽视人才培养；出于经济需要派出和接收学习很少；诊治病人重数量，轻质量，易造成草率处置。
