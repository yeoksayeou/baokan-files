Taiwan "National Policy Advisor" Zhao Yao Dong recently spoke at a lecture hosted by the Taiwan *Gongshang Bao* (Commercial Times), expressing his concerns about the potential for major turmoil in Taiwan. He believes that Taiwan's political landscape is undergoing rapid changes, the economic situation is fraught with crises, and societal psychology is in a state of confusion and disorientation, all of which pose significant risks for large-scale unrest.

Zhao Yao Dong stated that Taiwan's politics are currently in a state of rapid transformation. On one hand, there are positive changes towards greater democracy and openness. On the other hand, there are negative changes: firstly, there is a lack of efficient governance, with no one respecting or fearing anyone else; secondly, there is a lack of rule of law, with shouting matches and physical violence becoming commonplace. The chaotic scenes in the "Legislative Yuan" (parliament) are likely unparalleled worldwide, and the political divisions are also likely unmatched globally.

He believes that Taiwan's societal psychology is also in a state of confusion and disorientation. In the past, people's simplicity, diligence, law-abiding nature, and contentment were highly valued. However, today, societal values have changed, with moral confusion and blurred lines between right and wrong becoming the norm. This can be seen from two aspects: first, the worship of money, where everything is judged by wealth, and "money is power"; second, the glorification of strength, where might makes right, and "power brings money." This transformation not only violates the ethics of a free economy but also deviates from the norms of a rule-of-law society, becoming an "abnormality." Even more alarming is that societal ethics have been damaged, societal values have been inverted, and societal shame has been obscured.

Zhao Yao Dong said that internally, the economy is struggling to take root: private investment is insufficient, technological levels are low, foundations are weak, government investment is lagging, and public infrastructure is generally inadequate, all of which hinder progress. These two factors form a serious bottleneck for development, and while efforts are being made to break through, progress is slow. Externally, there are potential financial crises: first, the speculation with money, which creates a false prosperity wherever it goes, but once it collapses, it becomes a crisis; second, investment institutions, especially investment companies and futures companies, are deeply involved in financial speculation, and the resulting chain reactions of bankruptcies are likely unavoidable. As for external threats, the main issues are various unfavorable changes in the international economic situation, such as the tightening of the U.S. market, the rise of protectionism, and the fierce competition from developing countries, all of which create obstacles for Taiwan's continued expansion of trade.

Zhao Yao Dong pointed out that Taiwan's current political, social, and economic problems must change and will inevitably change.

### 台湾“国策顾问”赵耀东直言忧患  台潜伏大动乱危机

　　台湾“国策顾问”赵耀东直言忧患
    台潜伏大动乱危机
    新华社北京１月６日电  台湾“国策顾问”赵耀东最近在台湾《工商时报》举办的讲座上的演讲中认为，今天台湾政治转变令人担忧，经济形势危机四伏，社会心理混乱失落，潜伏着发生大动乱的危机。
    赵耀东说，今天台湾政治正处于急遽转变的时候。一方面是“好的转变，走向更民主、更开放”；另方面是不好的转变：一则没有人治的效率，谁也不服谁，谁也不怕谁；二则没有法治的规矩，叫骂之声拳头暴力此起彼落。今天“国会”议事殿堂的混乱情形，恐怕是举世罕匹，政治主张的分歧对立，恐怕也是举世罕匹。
    他认为，今天台湾的社会心理也是处于混乱失落的时候。在过去，人们的纯朴、勤勉、守法、守分，受到十分肯定。但到今天，民风丕变，“价值混乱，是非不清”，已是社会风气的典型写照。这又可由两方面来看：一是拜金，一切看钞票，“有钱就有权”，“有钱便是娘”。二是尚力，一切拿拳头、“有拳就有理”，“有拳便有钱”。这种转变既不遵守自由经济的伦理，同时更背离法治社会的常轨，成了一种“异形”。而更为可怕的，是社会的伦理被破坏了，社会的是非被颠倒了，社会的羞耻心被蒙蔽了。
    赵耀东说，言内忧，这一方面是经济不能扎根：民间投资不足，技术层次不高，基础虚浮，政府投资迟滞，公共建设普遍不足，阻碍进步；这两者构成发展的严重瓶颈，目前虽想突破，却是处处突不破。另方面则是潜伏的金融危机：一是金钱游戏，也就是玩钱，玩到哪里，哪里就出现繁荣的假象，而一旦溃决，就是个危机问题；二是热衷金融游戏的投资机构，尤其是投资公司与期货公司，因玩钱造成连锁倒闭，恐怕更难避免。至于外患，主要是国际经济情势种种不利的转变，如美国市场的紧缩，保护主义的高涨，开发中国家的激烈竞争等，造成台湾继续拓展贸易的阻力。
    赵耀东指出，今天台湾这等政治、社会与经济的病象，必须有所变，也不得不变。
