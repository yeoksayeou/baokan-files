To strengthen the management of quarantine for imported and exported animals and plants, the Xiamen Animal and Plant Quarantine Office has taken the lead in implementing a quarantine registration system within the country. Animal and plant quarantine is based on regulations to prohibit or restrict the movement of certain animals and plants infected with diseases and pests, as well as their products, between countries or regions, to prevent the spread of these diseases and pests.

The domestic and overseas youth photography art exhibition opened at the China Art Gallery on the morning of January 16. Song Renqiong, Yang Dezhi, Kang Keqing, Cheng Siyuan, Yang Chengwu, and hundreds of photography enthusiasts attended the exhibition. This exhibition features 350 works.
