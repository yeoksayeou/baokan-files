The momentum of achieving excellent results is irresistible. Wang Xiulan breaks another world record.

BEIJING, Jan. 11 (Xinhua) -- Wang Xiulan, a new star in short-track speed skating, showed her unstoppable competitive spirit today at the National Short-Track Speed Skating Championship held at the Capital Gymnasium. She broke one world record and one national record.

In the morning's women's 500-meter preliminary, Wang Xiulan took the lead with a time of 48.6 seconds, breaking the national record of 48.7 seconds. In the final, she was eager to break the world record but fell just half a lap from the finish line, missing the opportunity. However, in the evening's women's 1000-meter event, she achieved her goal, finishing with a time of 1 minute 38.8 seconds, surpassing Li Yan's world record of 1 minute 39 seconds set at the Winter Olympics. Guo Hongru also matched the world record with a time of 1 minute 38.8 seconds.

After the race, Wang Xiulan said, "I've been eager to surpass domestic champions and world records for a long time, but my luck hasn't been good the past two years. In two international competitions, I was disqualified for a rule violation in one and couldn't compete due to altitude sickness in the other." In May last year, Wang Xiulan was selected for the national team, and her performance improved significantly. Her coach described her as having excellent cornering skills and explosive power but noted that she is emotionally volatile and lacks competition experience.

In the men's 500-meter event, Changchun athlete Jiang Zhibin broke the national record with a time of 45.6 seconds, surpassing the previous record of 46.5 seconds.

　　创佳绩之势一发而不可收
    王秀兰又超世界纪录
    本报北京１月１１日讯  记者李北大报道：短跑道速滑新秀王秀兰今天在首都体育馆进行的全国短跑道速滑冠军赛上，争强好胜之势一发而不可收，又超一项世界纪录，破一项全国纪录。
    上午女子５００米预赛，王秀兰先声夺人，以４８秒６的成绩打破４８秒７的全国纪录。决赛，她冲击世界纪录心切，在一路领先，滑至离终点仅有半圈时摔倒，痛失良机。不过在晚上女子１０００米比赛中，她如愿以偿，以１分３８秒８的佳绩超过李琰在冬季奥运会上创造的１分３９秒的世界纪录。郭红茹也以１分３８秒８的成绩超过世界纪录。
    王秀兰下场后说：“早就憋着劲赶超国内名将和世界纪录，只是这两年运气不佳，两次出国比赛，一次因犯规被罚下场，一次因晕机身体不适未上场。”去年５月，王秀兰入选国家队，成绩随之大幅度提高。教练对她的评价是：弯道技术过硬，爆发力好，但情绪易波动，比赛经验欠缺。
    男子５００米比赛，长春选手蒋志斌以４５秒６成绩破４６秒５的全国纪录。
