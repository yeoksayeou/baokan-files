The incident took place in Tongxian County, Beijing. On December 25, 1988, at 7:30 PM, the sound of ice being broken echoed over the lake near a certain camp in Zhangjiawan. The platoon leader, Wang Yufeng, of the 1st Company of the Garrison Regiment, ordered three soldiers to search along the shore while he led the remaining four soldiers to skate to the opposite shore and move west. When they reached the southern side of the camp, they discovered two individuals breaking the ice to steal the army's fish. Upon seeing the patrol, one of the thieves abandoned his net and fled, while the other was caught on the spot.

While escorting the thief back to the company, the thief, Li Baohua, kicked and jumped on the thin ice, which was only 5.5 centimeters thick. Despite the soldiers' warnings about the danger, he continued to struggle. At a point 40 meters from the shore, the ice suddenly cracked, and five soldiers along with the thief fell into a 7-meter-deep ice hole. Wang Yufeng, Ling Zhiliang, and Ma Jihong managed to climb out of the water. They quickly used their belts to pull the thief, Li Baohua, out of the water. Suddenly, Wang Yufeng, who had been cut by ice shards in multiple places, heard someone shouting, "Li Helin is still in the water!" He braved the sub-zero temperatures and jumped back into the lake to search for his comrade. Unfortunately, both young soldiers lost their lives due to exhaustion.

That night, the two thieves were apprehended by the public security officers. Shortly after, the two soldiers who sacrificed their lives were posthumously recognized as martyrs and were awarded the First and Second Class Meritorious Service Medals, respectively.

The lake temporarily fell silent, but discussions within and outside the military camp were heated.

The soldier, Ling Zhiliang, who used his belt to pull the thief out of the water, said, "If we had saved Li Helin instead of the thief first, the outcome might have been different. But at that moment, there was no time to think about it. We just thought that the thief is also a person, and soldiers cannot stand by and watch someone die."

"Who will protect the 'Great Wall'?"

The public security officer from Tongxian County questioned the thief, Li Baohua, "Why did you steal the army's fish?"

"For money," he replied bluntly.

It was understood that in December 1988 alone, the 1st Company of the Garrison Regiment had 600 meters of cable stolen, one large pig, and over 100 birdcages. The loss of fish in the camp's lake was even more difficult to estimate. Sometimes, there were as many as 16 incidents of ice-breaking and fishing in a single day.

Despite the efforts of the soldiers on patrol and duty to dissuade them, the thieves continued their actions. These "professional" thieves knew that the army's rule was to not retaliate with violence, so they had no fear of entering the camp to steal. In September of the previous year, the platoon leader and five soldiers were on patrol when they confiscated four fishing nets from the thieves. As a result, the platoon leader was beaten to the ground and thrown into the lake. Later, when the public security officers arrived, the thieves mistook them for reinforcements and shouted, "Soldiers, come over! Soldiers, come over!" It was only when they realized the officers were from the public security that they fled in panic.

According to a relevant official from the public security department, similar incidents have occurred in many places across the country. Some military airfields have had navigation lights stolen, telephone lines cut, military equipment parts dismantled and sold as scrap, and military food production bases have been increasingly disturbed...

Deputy Director of the Public Security Bureau of Tongxian County, Wen Kai, told the reporter, "Now, some people are guarding the train station while eating the railway, and near the camp, they are 'slaughtering' the army. Most of the thieves are not intentionally causing trouble but are driven by greed. These people think that stealing a few chickens or catching a few fish is no big deal, after all, it's public property. It seems that perfecting defense laws and strengthening defense education is urgent."

The soldiers of the 1st Company of the Garrison Regiment believe that relying solely on "persuasion" and "reformation" will not be effective. For a period, some villagers near the garrison wanted to enter the camp to cut vines from the mountain to weave baskets to sell. The company's officers, considering that the army did not need these vines, organized all the soldiers to cut the vines for a whole day and gave them to the villagers for free, saying, "The vines on the mountain have all been cut, so you won't need to enter the camp anymore." For the next few days, indeed, no one entered the camp to cut vines, but a few trees by the camp's lake were cut down...

Recently, Director Li Shuan of the Logistics Department of the Beijing Garrison Command told the reporter, "Defense legislation and defense education are the two wings of enhancing citizens' defense awareness. In the past, we often emphasized ideological education while neglecting the role of legal constraints, resulting in an imbalance. Moreover, from a certain perspective, laws are more fundamental, authoritative, stable, and long-term than factors like 'attention' and 'awareness.' We already have the 'Conscription Law,' and we need to establish and improve the Military Facilities Protection Law, National Defense Mobilization Law, Military-Industrial Production Law, Officer Retirement Settlement Law, and Veterans and Families of Martyrs Preferential Treatment Law. With a complete set of defense laws and comprehensive defense education, our military can truly play the role of the 'Great Wall' of the Republic."

Calling for the "Soul of the Nation"

At a meeting in the 1st Company of the Beijing Military Region Garrison Regiment, the political instructor, Zheng Zhongchao, recounted an episode from the "Ice Lake Rescue":

After Li Baohua was rescued to the ice surface, he took advantage of the platoon leader, Wang Yufeng, re-entering the ice hole to save his comrade and fled. At that moment, the other thief, Li Baoyin, who had escaped earlier, was rallying several villagers from Jiagezhuang with sticks, shouting, "Soldiers are catching people! Catch the soldiers!" They charged towards the lake with great momentum. When they saw the incident at the lake, they quickly retreated back to the village.

The public security officer interrogated Li Baohua, "After you were rescued, why didn't you save others but ran away yourself?"

Li Baohua said, "At that time, I didn't think about it. I was all wet, and I just wanted to go home and change my clothes."

It seems that he thought "changing clothes" was more important than "saving the soldiers." This mentality reflects the significant contrast in national consciousness today. Some people selflessly serve the public, while others harm others for personal gain; some people sacrifice themselves for righteousness, while others live in a cowardly manner. Some people exchange their lives for the peace of others, while some build their happiness on the graves of others. Do we praise the former more than we support them? Do we remain indifferent to the latter more than we condemn them? Moreover, can we truly summon the "soul of the nation" by relying on a part of the people to always talk about sacrifice, without stopping another part from pursuing self-interest?

Recently, at a meeting where some soldiers stationed in Beijing and news reporters discussed, some comrades raised several questions they found puzzling. For example, why do some people who help others face ridicule and mockery? Why, after years of promoting spiritual civilization, do some people still feel at ease when they see someone in danger and do nothing? Why, in recent years, has the material living standard improved, but the moral standards of some people have declined?

Some said, "When people are in trouble, they first seek help from the soldiers. The soldiers must not lower their standards or forget their duties because of some unpleasant incidents in certain places."

Others said, "In the past, we used the phrase 'fish cannot live without water' to describe the relationship between the military and the people, and between leaders and the masses. Now, to compose a new chapter of the fish-water relationship in the new era, it is not something that can be solved by holding a few meetings or conducting a few visits."

After the interview, the reporter reflected for a long time. Indeed, to revitalize China, we must first invigorate the spirit of the entire nation and rebuild the soul of the Chinese nation! Only with the rise and unity of the entire nation can the country prosper; only with the improvement of national quality and the enhancement of national and ethnic consciousness can we face the severe challenges of the current era, and the prosperity of the people and the country will have a reliable guarantee!

    一个小偷得救了，两名解放军战士牺牲了。对于这件事情，如何评说？如何认识？请看——
    冰湖救人引出的思考

    两条生命与一个小偷
    事情发生在北京通县。
    １９８８年１２月２５日１９时３０分，通县张家湾某营区湖面上响起了咚咚的砸冰声。正在国防工事附近担负巡逻任务的守备一连班长王玉峰，一面命令３名战士沿湖岸向前搜索，一面带领其余４名战士滑冰到湖对岸向西迂回。当他们搜索到营区南侧时，发现湖中有两人正在破冰偷部队的鱼。见到巡逻兵，偷鱼者一个弃网逃跑，一个被当场抓获。
    押回连部途中，偷鱼人李宝华在仅有５．５厘米厚的冰面上乱踢乱蹦。尽管战士们警告他这样做有危险，他仍玩命冲撞。在离岸４０米处时，冰层突然破裂，５名战士及小偷同时落入７米深的冰窟。王玉峰、凌直亮、马继红等战士爬出冰面，急忙解下腰带把案犯李宝华救了出来。突然，身上被冰碴多处划伤的王玉峰听到有人喊：“李合林还在水里！”他冒着零下５摄氏度的严寒，再次跳入湖中寻找战友。终因体力不支，两位年轻军人献出了宝贵的生命。
    两名案犯当晚被公安干警捉拿归案。不久，两名牺牲的军人被追认为烈士，分别被追记一等功、二等功。
    冰湖暂时停止了喧闹，而军营内外却议论纷纷。
    那位用皮带把案犯拉出水面的战士凌直亮认为：“我们首先救出的如果不是案犯，而是李合林，结局也许大不一样了。但当时来不及考虑那么多。只想到，案犯也是人，军人不能见死不救。”
    “长城”卫国土，谁来护“长城”？
    通县公安局干警审问案犯李宝华：“你为什么偷部队的鱼？”
    “为了挣钱。”回答干脆明了。
    据了解，仅去年１２月份，王玉峰所在的守备一连就被偷窃电缆线６００多米，大猪一头，鸽笼１００多片。至于营区湖里的鱼，损失更是无法估算。有时一天，凿冰撒网偷鱼竟达１６起。
    尽管巡逻、值勤的官兵前去劝阻，仍无济于事。这些偷鱼“专业户”知道解放军的规矩是骂不还口、打不还手，所以进营区偷窃无所顾忌。去年９月，连长带５名战士巡逻时，没收了偷鱼者的４张渔网。结果，连长被不法分子打倒在地，然后投进湖里。后来派出所干警赶来了，偷鱼者还以为来的是“援军”，竟摆出一副挑战的姿态喊道：“当兵的过来！当兵的过来！”等他们发现来人是公安干警时，才慌慌张张地溜进了村。
    据公安部门有关同志介绍，在全国不少地方都发生了这类案件。有的军用机场航标灯被盗走，电话线被割断，军械部件被拆掉后当废品卖掉，营区副食生产基地受到的滋扰更是日趋严重……
    通县公安局副局长温凯对记者说：“现在一些人是守着车站吃铁路，挨着营区‘宰’部队。偷窃者大多还不是存心破坏，而是为了钱。这些人觉得抓去几只鸡、弄上几条鱼不算啥事，反正是公家的。看来，完善国防法规，加强国防教育，已刻不容缓。”
    守备一连的官兵认为，仅靠“劝告”、“感化”是不能奏效的。有一段时间，驻地附近少数村民要进营区割山上的藤条编箩筐卖。连队干部考虑到部队也不需要这些藤条，就发动全连官兵上山割了一整天，把藤条无偿送给驻地的村民，并说：“山上的藤条都割完了，你们也就用不着进营区了。”以后几天，的确没有人进营区割藤条了，但营区湖边的树又被人砍倒了几棵……
    北京卫戍区后勤部部长李书安近日对记者说，国防立法和国防教育是增强公民国防意识的双翼，而我们过去往往注重思想教育，忽视法律制约的作用，结果，失去一翼就失去了平衡。而且从一定意义上看，法规比“重视”、“觉悟”等因素更具有根本性、权威性、稳定性和长期性。我们已经有了一部《兵役法》，还需要建立健全军事设施保护法、国防动员法、军工生产法、军官退役安置法、烈军属优抚法等。有了健全的国防法规，有了普遍而深入的国防教育，我们的军队才能真正起到共和国“长城”的作用。
    呼唤“民族之魂”
    在北京军区守备一连的座谈会上，指导员郑中朝讲到这次“冰湖救人”的一段插曲：
    案犯李宝华被救到冰面以后，便趁班长王玉峰再入冰窟救战友之机逃之夭夭。这时，早先逃走的另一名案犯李宝银正纠集贾各庄几个不明真相的村民，手持棍棒，喊着“大兵抓人啦！抓大兵啊！”气势汹汹地冲来。快到湖边时，发现这里出了事，便赶紧溜回村里。
    通县公安干警审讯李宝华：“你被救以后，为什么不去救别人而自己跑了？”
    李宝华说：“当时我没想那么多。我身上全湿了，只想赶紧回家换衣服。”
    看来，他觉得“换衣服”比“救大兵”更紧要。这种心态显示了当今国民意识的巨大反差。一些人忘我为公，一些人损人利己；一些人舍身取义，一些人苟且偷生。有的人用个人的牺牲换来众人的安宁，有的人却把自己的欢乐建立在他人的墓碑上。对于前者，我们是否赞叹多于扶持？对于后者，我们是否冷漠多于谴责？而且，只靠一部分人老讲牺牲，不制止另一部分人专谋私利，能真正召来我们的“民族之魂”么？
    最近，在驻京部分官兵与新闻记者对话的一次座谈会上，一些同志谈了他们困惑不解的几个问题。如：为什么有人助人为乐却反遭一些人的冷嘲热讽？为什么精神文明搞了这么多年，有的人见死不救还心安理得？为什么这些年物质生活水平提高了，而一些人的道德水准却下降了？
    有的说：“人们有了困苦，首先求助解放军，这是对解放军的信赖。部队同志决不能因某些地方出了一些不愉快的事情而降低标准，忘掉军人的职责。”
    有的说：“过去我们用‘鱼儿离不开水’来比喻军民之间、干群之间的关系。如今，谱写新时期的鱼水篇，决不是开几次会，搞几天慰问所能解决的。”
    采访归来，记者沉思良久。是啊，要振兴中华，首先要振奋全民族的精神，再造中华民族之魂！唯有整个民族的奋起、团结，国家才能昌盛；唯有国民素质的提高、国家和民族意识的增强，才能迎接当今时代的严峻挑战，民富国强才有可靠的保证！
