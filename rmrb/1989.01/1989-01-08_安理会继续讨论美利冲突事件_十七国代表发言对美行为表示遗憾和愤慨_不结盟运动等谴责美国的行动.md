The United Nations Security Council today continued its emergency meeting to discuss the incident of U.S. aircraft shooting down a Libyan plane. During the meeting, representatives from 17 countries spoke, expressing regret and indignation over the U.S. resorting to military force in international relations, which has escalated international tensions.

Chinese representative Li Luye said, "Currently, the world is transitioning from confrontation to dialogue, from tension to relaxation. Using military means to resolve international disputes is increasingly ineffective." He demanded that the U.S. cease all military actions against Libya and urged all parties to exercise restraint to prevent the situation from worsening, thereby ensuring peace and stability in the Mediterranean region.

Yugoslavian representative Dragoslav Pejic pointed out that regardless of how it is explained, the U.S. use of force against Libya seriously threatens the security of a small non-aligned country, worsening the situation in the Mediterranean, which is unacceptable to people.

Soviet representative Alexander Belonogov stated that the U.S. use of force against Libya is unreasonable, and the Soviet Union cannot agree that the U.S. has the right to punish other countries. The U.S. actions have damaged the prospects for peace in the Middle East. He also suggested that the navies of both the U.S. and the Soviet Union withdraw from the Mediterranean.

Algerian representative Houkine Judi said that the threat to Libya cannot be ignored, and he hoped that the Security Council would prevent the U.S. from launching new attacks on Libya.

The Security Council will continue its meeting next week to discuss the issue of the U.S. shooting down a Libyan plane.

According to reports from our correspondents in the Middle East and Africa, the Non-Aligned Movement, the African Trade Union Organization, and the United Arab Emirates have condemned the U.S. action of shooting down a Libyan plane.

Non-Aligned Movement Chairman and Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe condemned the U.S. action of shooting down a Libyan plane in international waters during a press conference held in Harare on January 6. He described the U.S. attack as "disgusting."

The African Trade Union Organization issued a statement on January 6, expressing shock at the U.S. attack and calling for the U.S. to stop its aggression and threats against Libya under any pretext. The organization also called on the international community to pressure the U.S. government to stop all hostile actions against Libya, ensuring peace and stability in the Mediterranean region.

The spokesperson for the United Arab Emirates' Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned the U.S. attack on January 6, stating that it was "unjustifiable" and would only exacerbate tensions in the Mediterranean region.

　　安理会继续讨论美利冲突事件
    十七国代表发言对美行为表示遗憾和愤慨
    不结盟运动等谴责美国的行动
    本报联合国１月６日电  记者刘开宸报道：联合国安理会今天继续召开紧急会议，讨论美国飞机击落利比亚飞机事件。会上，１７个国家的代表发表讲话，对美国在国际关系中诉诸武力导致国际局势紧张的行为表示遗憾和愤慨。
    中国代表李鹿野指出，“目前世界正在从对抗转向对话，由紧张转向缓和，用军事手段解决国际争端越来越行不通”。他要求美国停止对利比亚的一切军事行动，并呼吁有关方面克制，防止事态进一步恶化，以保证地中海地区的和平与稳定。
    南斯拉夫代表德拉戈斯拉夫·佩吉克指出，不管怎样解释，美国对利比亚使用武力严重威胁一个不结盟小国的安全，恶化了地中海地区的形势，是人们无法接受的。
    苏联代表亚历山大·别洛诺戈夫说，美国对利比亚使用武力是毫无道理的，苏联不能同意美国有权惩罚别的国家。美国的行动损害了中东和平的前景。他还建议美国与苏联的海军都从地中海撤出。
    阿尔及利亚代表胡基奈·朱迪说，对利比亚面临的威胁不能置之不理，希望安理会阻止美国对利比亚发动新的攻击。
    安理会将在下周继续举行会议，讨论美国击落利比亚飞机问题。
    新华社北京１月７日电　综合本社驻中东和非洲地区记者的报道，不结盟运动、非洲工会组织和阿拉伯联合酋长国谴责美国击落利比亚飞机行动。
    不结盟运动主席、津巴布韦总统穆加贝６日在哈拉雷举行的记者招待会上谴责美国在国际水域上空击落利比亚飞机的行动。他指出，美国的袭击是“令人厌恶的”。
    非洲工会统一组织６日发表声明，对美国的袭击表示震惊，呼吁美国停止在任何借口下对利比亚进行侵略和威胁。
    同时，该组织还“呼吁国际社会对美国政府施加压力，使之停止对利比亚的一切敌对行动，使地中海地区充满和平与稳定的气氛”。
    阿拉伯联合酋长国外交部发言人６日在谴责美国的袭击时说，这是“无法辩解的行为”，它只能加剧地中海地区的紧张局势。
