India has made significant progress in improving rural drinking water conditions in the past three years.

In 1985, India had 161,700 villages, accounting for about a quarter of the country's total villages, where drinking water was not hygienic. Through the government's drinking water improvement program, 88,600 villages have completely solved the problem of unhygienic drinking water in the past three years, and another 26,500 villages have partially solved this problem. The government plans to bring the drinking water in another 32,700 villages up to hygienic standards during the 1988-1989 fiscal year.
