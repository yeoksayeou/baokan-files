This year marks the first year of China's implementation of the "Vegetable Basket Project." At the national livestock and aquaculture work conference held on January 10, the Ministry of Agriculture presented a plan for the years 1989 to 1992.

The overall guiding principle of this plan is: the development of subsidiary food production must start from China's actual situation, implement classified guidance, rationally utilize and comprehensively develop land resources, take effective measures to develop production, adjust the production and supply structure, improve operational management levels, enhance economic benefits, and improve the effective supply level in cities.

Last May, the Ministry of Agriculture submitted a proposal to the State Council titled "Suggestions on Developing Subsidiary Food Production to Ensure Urban Supply (abbreviated as the 'Vegetable Basket Project')." This proposal received attention from central leaders and approval from the State Planning Commission. Subsequently, the Ministry of Agriculture invited some experts, scholars, and practical workers to conduct investigations and research on the production and consumption dynamics, development goals, and guarantee measures of meat, eggs, and milk in 67 major and medium-sized cities nationwide. Based on this, a comprehensive implementation plan was formulated.

The plan sets the overall production goal: by 1992, compared to 1987, increase meat production by 400 million tons, eggs by 225 million tons, milk by 240 million tons, and fish by 260 million tons. This will improve the supply of animal-derived foods nationwide, especially in major and medium-sized cities, and achieve a balanced and high-quality supply of vegetables in cities. To this end, in the meat, egg, and milk production sectors, it is necessary to strengthen the construction of basic facilities, adjust the production structure, and establish economic cooperation zones and commercial production bases for livestock products. In the aquaculture sector, it is necessary to vigorously develop urban-suburban fisheries; focus on the breeding of the Bohai Sea; increase the near-shore resources; accelerate the technological transformation of fishing vessels, and develop offshore and distant-water fisheries. In the vegetable production sector, it is necessary to expand the area of protected vegetable cultivation, increase the supply of fine vegetables in winter and spring; and initially establish a vegetable storage and processing system.

The funding for implementing the plan will primarily come from local sources, with the majority being self-raised by the people, and the state will provide necessary support for key construction projects. According to preliminary estimates, including the existing investment amounts from the state and local governments, a total investment of 14.245 billion yuan is required.

　　抓紧建设副食品基地　努力丰富市场供应
    我国今年正式实施菜篮子工程
    规划要求一九九二年肉蛋奶鱼均增产数百万吨
    本报讯  记者黄彩忠报道：今年是我国实施菜篮子工程第一年，在１月１０日召开的全国畜牧水产工作会议上，农业部拿出了１９８９年至１９９２年的实施规划。
    这个规划的总的指导方针是：发展副食品生产要从我国实际出发，实行分类指导，合理利用和综合开发国土资源，采取有力措施发展生产，调整生产与供应结构，提高经营管理水平，提高经济效益，提高城市的有效供应水平。
    去年５月，农业部向国务院提出“关于发展副食品生产保障城市供应（简称“菜篮子工程”）的建议”，得到中央领导同志的重视和国家计委的同意。接着，农业部邀请部分专家、学者和实际工作者，在调查研究全国６７个大中城市肉蛋奶生产与消费动态、发展目标和保证措施的基础上，制定出总体实施规划。
    规划提出总的生产目标是：到１９９２年，比１９８７年增加肉类４００万吨、蛋２２５万吨、奶２４０万吨、鱼２６０万吨，使全国特别是大中城市的动物性食品供应有所改善，并实现城市蔬菜均衡优质上市。为此，肉蛋奶生产方面要强化基础设施建设，调整生产结构，建立畜产品产销经济协作区和商品生产基地。水产品生产方面要大力发展城郊渔业；以渤海养殖为重点，抓好近海资源的增殖；加快渔船技术改造，发展外海及远洋渔业。蔬菜生产方面要扩大保护地蔬菜面积，增加冬、春季的细菜供应；初步建立起蔬菜贮藏、加工体系。
    实施规划的资金来源以地方为主，群众自筹为主，国家对重点建设项目给予必要的扶持。据初步匡算，包括国家和地方现有投资金额在内，共需总投资１４２．４５亿元。
