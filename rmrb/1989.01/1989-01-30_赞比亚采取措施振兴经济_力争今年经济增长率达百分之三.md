Zambia has taken a series of measures at the start of the year to revitalize its economy, which has been in decline for years.

On New Year's Day, President Kaunda announced Zambia's fourth national economic development plan, aiming to achieve an economic growth rate of 3% this year and to limit the inflation rate to below 20%.

Under the guidance of the principle "relying on our own resources to develop the economy," Zambia will vigorously develop the tourism industry this year. On January 5, the Zambian government announced an allocation of 12 billion kwacha (approximately $120 million) for the development of tourism. In addition to improving facilities and adding amenities in tourist areas such as Victoria Falls, Zambia will also launch various preferential tourism projects to promote regional joint tourism development, and open new entertainment venues and resorts to increase tourism revenue. This year, Zambia aims to earn $21.5 million in foreign exchange from tourism. By 1993, tourism foreign exchange earnings are expected to reach $32.3 million.

For a long time, Zambia has implemented a subsidy system for staple foods. Last year, Zambia's subsidy for maize meal alone was estimated to cost $115.64 million. To reduce the economic burden on the country and develop the economy, Zambia announced on January 7 the implementation of a new maize meal supply system in urban areas, stipulating that only family members and individuals under the age of 21 are eligible to purchase 14 kilograms of maize meal per month at the subsidized price. Other residents must purchase grain at approximately three times the subsidized price in the market.

In addition, all hospitals and medical facilities in Zambia have announced that they will start charging for previously free services such as laboratory tests, X-rays, and vaccinations.

In recent years, the supply of sugar, salt, cooking oil, and detergent has been tight in Zambia. To meet market demand, the Zambian government began simplifying import procedures on January 20, allowing residents to use funds from abroad to import necessary living supplies of their choice.

In May of the previous year, Zambia's implementation of the development plan formulated by the International Monetary Fund was unsuccessful, leading to a falling-out with the organization and a halt in communications. To secure loans and funds for economic development, Zambia has recently resumed contact with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. On January 22, Zambian President Kaunda confirmed that the International Monetary Fund has decided to adopt a more flexible stance and participate in Zambia's economic revitalization plan.

　　赞比亚采取措施振兴经济     
    力争今年经济增长率达百分之三
    新华社卢萨卡１月２７日电  赞比亚今年伊始，采取一系列措施，振兴连年衰退的经济。
    今年元旦，卡翁达总统宣布了赞比亚第４个国民经济发展计划，力争今年经济增长率达３％，并将通货膨胀率限制在２０％以下。
    在“依靠自己的资源发展经济”的宗旨指导下，今年赞比亚将大力发展旅游事业。元月５日，赞比亚政府宣布拨出１２亿卡瓦查（约合１．２亿美元），用于旅游事业的发展。除了在旅游胜地维多利亚瀑布等旅游区完善设备，增添设施之外，赞比亚还将开展多种优惠旅游项目，促进地区性联合旅游的发展，并开设新的娱乐场和休养所，以增加旅游的收入。今年，赞比亚力争从发展旅游中纯收外汇２１５０万美元。到１９９３年，使旅游外汇收入达到３２３０万美元。
    长期以来，赞比亚实行主食补贴制度。去年，赞比亚仅给居民补贴玉米面就预计支出１１５６４万美元。为了减轻国家的经济负担发展经济，赞比亚元月７日宣布在城镇居民中实行新的玉米面供给制，规定只有家属和年龄在２１岁以下的人才有权按国家补贴价格每月购买１４公斤玉米面。其他居民必须按大约等于补贴价格３倍的市场价格购粮。
    另外，赞比亚的所有医院、医疗结构还宣布将对化验、透视和打预防针等以前免费的项目开始收费。
    近年来，赞比亚市场上食糖、食盐、食油和洗衣粉等供应紧张。为了满足市场需要，赞比亚政府元月２０日开始简化进口手续，允许居民利用在国外的资金，按照自己的选择从国外进口生活必需品。
    前年５月，赞比亚因推行国际基金组织制定的发展计划受挫，曾同该组织闹翻，不同该组织来往。为了争取得到贷款和资金发展经济，赞比亚近来已开始同国际货币基金组织和世界银行恢复接触。今年１月２２日赞比亚总统卡翁达证实，国际货币基金组织已决定采取比较灵活的立场，参与赞比亚的经济复兴计划。
