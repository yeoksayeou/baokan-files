	Ministry of Foreign Trade Spokesperson: China's Foreign Trade Will Maintain an Appropriate Growth Rate

	People's Daily, Beijing, January 23 - Reporter Lü Zhenhua: In the face of China's efforts to reduce the economic growth rate and control the export of certain goods this year, what will be the trend in foreign trade development? Today, Liu Xiangdong, spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Trade, revealed in response to questions from domestic and foreign journalists that China will adopt an active policy to maintain an appropriate growth rate in foreign trade.

	Since last year, China has experienced a significant rise in prices, and this year, the economic growth rate will be reduced. What impact will this have on foreign trade? Liu Xiangdong answered this question by saying that last year, China's foreign trade fully implemented the contract responsibility system, with provinces, municipalities, autonomous regions, and relevant foreign trade enterprises signing contracts with the state on three indicators: foreign exchange earnings from exports, remittances to the state, and economic benefits. The rise in prices has increased the cost for foreign trade enterprises, making it somewhat difficult to complete the contracted tasks. However, looking at the actual situation last year, the growth rate of exports was still relatively fast, economic benefits were good, and the situation was favorable. The impact of last year's price increases on foreign trade may become clearer in the first half of this year.

	Liu Xiangdong also clearly stated that China's efforts to eliminate economic "overheating" this year will create a good and stable domestic environment for foreign trade development, which is beneficial. It can be foreseen that under this policy, excessive social demand will be reduced, and the contradiction between domestic and foreign sales of some commodities will be somewhat alleviated. It will also be possible to make more use of the surplus production capacity in processing enterprises to develop the production of export products or undertake processing with supplied materials. Of course, controlling the export of some domestically scarce raw materials will increase the difficulty of foreign trade to some extent, but the state will adopt an active policy to maintain an appropriate growth rate in foreign trade. For example, the foreign trade department will, according to the needs of the international market and China's advantages, actively develop competitive industries and export products, vigorously improve the quality of export commodities, optimize the structure of export commodities, and open up international markets in multiple dimensions to strive for stable and sustained growth in export trade, ensuring that China has the necessary international payment capacity.

	Why has China recently restricted the import of some commodities such as tobacco and alcohol? Liu Xiangdong replied to the reporter that China is a developing country with a shortage of foreign exchange. To ensure that limited foreign exchange is used in the most needed areas for national modernization, it is necessary to adjust China's import commodity structure. First, it is necessary to ensure the import of raw materials needed for agricultural production, key industrial production projects, and the production of consumer goods necessary for stabilizing people's lives. Other imports should be done according to one's ability. It is inappropriate to use precious foreign exchange to import high-end consumer goods, processing equipment with excess domestic production capacity, or consumer goods that can be fully met domestically. Liu Xiangdong pointed out that with the development of China's agriculture and industry and the increase in exports, the overall scale of imports is actually expanding rather than shrinking. Controlling the import of a few commodities will not affect the opportunities for foreign products to enter the Chinese market. China's foreign trade system, after reform, is compatible with the rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

	When discussing China's current trade relations with South Korea, the spokesperson said that China and South Korea do not have official political and economic trade relations. It is reported that South Korea is very enthusiastic about developing economic and trade relations with China, and some companies want to directly negotiate business with Chinese foreign trade companies. China's foreign trade system reform has given foreign trade enterprises greater operational autonomy, and it is up to the enterprises themselves to choose cooperation partners based on business needs.

### 经贸部新闻发言人称  我外贸将保持适当发展速度

　　经贸部新闻发言人称
    我外贸将保持适当发展速度
    本报北京１月２３日讯  记者陆振华报道：面对今年我国降低经济增长速度和对有些商品控制出口的形势，对外贸易发展趋势如何？今天经贸部新闻发言人刘向东在回答中外记者提问时透露：中国将采取积极方针，保持对外贸易适当发展速度。
    去年以来我国物价上涨幅度大，今年又将降低经济增长速度，这会对外贸带来什么后果？刘向东回答这个问题时说，去年我国外贸全面推行承包经营责任制，各省、市、自治区和有关外贸企业向国家承包了出口外汇、上缴国家外汇和经济效益３项指标。物价上涨使外贸企业的成本增强，也给承包任务的完成带来一定困难。不过，从去年的实际情况看，出口的增长速度还是较快的，经济效益良好，形势不错。去年的物价上涨对外贸的影响可能今年上半年会看得更清楚一些。
    刘向东还明确地说，今年我国将进行的消除经济“过热”，将为外贸发展创造一个良好、稳定的国内环境，对外贸的发展是有利的。可以预见，在这种方针下，会把过大的社会需求压缩下来，有些商品的内外销矛盾有所缓解，还可以更多地利用那些加工企业中多余的生产能力发展出口产品生产或承接来料加工等。当然，我国一些国内紧缺原料性商品出口适当控制后，对外贸易的难度会增加一些，但是，国家会采取积极的方针，对外贸易保持适当的发展速度。如经贸部门将根据国际市场的需要和我国的优势，积极发展有竞争力的产业和出口产品，大力提高出口商品的质量，优化出口商品的结构，多方位地开拓国际市场，争取出口贸易稳定持续地增长，以保证我国有必要的国际支付能力。
    中国为什么近来限制烟、酒等一些商品进口？刘向东回答记者说，我国是一个外汇短缺的发展中国家，为使有限的外汇用到国家现代化建设最需要的地方，有必要调整我国的进口商品结构。首先要保证农业生产、重点工业生产项目和稳定人民生活必需的消费品生产所需要的原材料的进口。其它的进口要量力而为。拿宝贵的外汇去进口高档消费品、国内生产能力已经过剩的加工设备或者国内完全可以满足需要的消费品，显然是不妥当的。刘向东指出，随着我国工农业生产的发展和出口的增加，实际上总的进口规模在扩大而不是缩小，控制少数商品的进口，不影响外国产品进入中国市场的机会。中国的外贸体制经过改革与关贸总协定的规则是能够适应的。
    在谈到目前中国与南朝鲜的贸易往来时，这位发言人说，我国与南朝鲜还没有官方的政治关系和经济贸易关系。据反映，南朝鲜对同中国发展经济贸易关系热情很高，一些公司要求同我国的外贸公司直接洽谈生意。我国外贸体制改革赋予外贸企业较大的经营自主权，根据业务需要选择合作对象，完全是企业自己的事。
