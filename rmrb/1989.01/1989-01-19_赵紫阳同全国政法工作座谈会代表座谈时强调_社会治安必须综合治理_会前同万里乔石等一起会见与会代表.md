Zhao Ziyang, who had just returned from an inspection tour outside Beijing, held a discussion with representatives of the National Political and Legal Work Conference in the Huairen Hall of Zhongnanhai this afternoon. He stressed the need to comprehensively manage social order while developing a commodity economy.

Zhao Ziyang said that while local party committees are focusing on economic work, they must also devote significant effort to party building, ideological and political work, and the development of democracy and the legal system. He believed that only when a region's economy develops and its ideological and political work is well-managed, will it have a stable and united environment, strong cohesion, and sustained enthusiasm and initiative among the people.

The National Political and Legal Work Conference began on January 12 in Beijing. The conference, based on a thorough study of the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee, focused on discussing how to further strengthen political and legal work in the context of rectifying the economic environment, improving economic order, and deepening comprehensive reforms.

Today's discussion was chaired by Qiao Shi, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and head of the Central Political and Legal Committee. Taskin, a member of the Central Political and Legal Committee and President of the Supreme People's Court, reported on the discussion of the political and legal work conference. Representatives from Guangdong and other places spoke about current social order issues, party leadership of political and legal work, comprehensive management of social order, and the construction of political and legal teams.

Zhao Ziyang said that in recent years, the political and legal departments, under the leadership of party committees and governments at all levels, have achieved significant results. Despite difficult conditions, a large number of cadres and police officers have done a great deal of work. Our political and legal teams are loyal to the party and the people, reliable, and overall, an excellent team.

Zhao Ziyang pointed out that during the period of peaceful construction, in the process of rectifying the economic environment, improving economic order, and deepening comprehensive reforms, and in the great cause of modernization and revitalizing China, the political and legal departments are in a very important position and bear a very heavy responsibility. He said that political and legal work can only be strengthened, not weakened. Party committees and governments at all levels must further strengthen their leadership of political and legal work, giving it more attention, understanding, and support.

Zhao Ziyang believed that there are many problems in social order at present, and comprehensive management is necessary. The most important thing is for party committees at all levels to adhere to the two-pronged approach: one hand to develop a commodity economy, and the other hand to manage the ideological and political fields.

He said that with such a major policy and a good atmosphere, relying on the comprehensive efforts of the whole society, social order can be improved.

Zhao Ziyang said that establishing a new order for a commodity economy should include the comprehensive management of social order in the new situation. First, large and medium-sized cities, key transportation routes, and coastal areas should be managed well, and a set of methods should be established. These places have the conditions to be managed first.

Zhao Ziyang proposed that to strengthen social order, comprehensive management must be combined with concentrated strikes and concentrated rectification. If a type of criminal activity is particularly rampant, it must be subjected to concentrated strikes; if a region or certain places have prominent problems, they must be subjected to concentrated rectification. While carrying out concentrated strikes and concentrated rectification, serious efforts must be made to build systems and carry out comprehensive management.

Wen Jiabao, a candidate member of the Secretariat of the Central Committee, and members of the Central Political and Legal Committee Wang Fang, Liu Fuzhi, Jia Chunwang, Cai Cheng, and Zhou Wenyuan, attended the discussion.

Before the discussion, Zhao Ziyang, Wan Li, Qiao Shi, Wen Jiabao, Chen Pishan, and Peng Chong met with all the representatives attending this conference.

　　赵紫阳同全国政法工作座谈会代表座谈时强调
    社会治安必须综合治理
    会前同万里乔石等一起会见与会代表
    新华社北京１月１８日电  （记者邹爱国）刚从外地考察回京的中共中央总书记赵紫阳，今天下午在中南海怀仁堂与出席全国政法工作座谈会的代表座谈时，再次强调在发展商品经济的同时，要大力抓好思想和政治领域的工作。
    赵紫阳说，各级党委在抓经济工作的同时，必须下大力量抓党的建设、思想政治工作、民主和法制建设等工作。他认为，一个地方只有经济发展了，同时又抓好了思想和政治领域的工作，那里才会有安定团结的环境，才会有巨大的凝聚力，群众的积极性和热情才能持续高涨。
    这次全国政法工作座谈会是１月１２日开始在北京举行的。会议在认真学习党的十三届三中全会精神的基础上，着重讨论了在治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序、全面深化改革中，如何进一步加强政法工作的问题。
    今天的座谈会由中共中央政治局常委、中央政法领导小组组长乔石主持。中央政法领导小组成员、最高人民法院院长任建新在会上介绍了政法工作座谈会的讨论情况。广东等地的代表在会上就当前的社会治安状况、党对政法工作的领导、社会治安的综合治理、政法队伍的建设等问题发表了意见。
    赵紫阳在讲话中说，这些年来政法部门在各级党委、政府的领导下，工作取得很大成绩，广大干警在困难的条件下，做了大量的工作。我们的政法队伍是忠于党、忠于人民的，是可以信赖的，整体上是一支优秀的队伍。
    赵紫阳指出，在和平建设的时期，在治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序、全面深化改革中，在实现四化、振兴中华的大业中，政法部门处在十分重要的位置上，担负着十分繁重的任务。他说，政法工作只能加强，不能削弱。各级党委、政府必须进一步加强对政法工作的领导，给政法工作以更大的重视、理解和支持。
    赵紫阳认为，当前社会治安方面的问题很多，必须进行综合治理。这里最重要的就是各级党委要坚持两手抓，一手抓发展商品经济，一手抓思想和政治领域的工作。
    他说，有这样一个大的方针，形成一个大气候，再依靠全社会力量进行综合治理，社会秩序就可以好转。
    赵紫阳说，建立商品经济的新秩序，应该包括新形势下的社会治安综合治理问题。首先应该把大中城市、交通要道、沿海地区管理好，要建立一套办法。这些地方有条件先管好。
    赵紫阳提出，加强社会治安，一定要把综合治理和集中打击、集中整顿结合起来。某项犯罪活动特别猖獗，就必须进行集中打击；某个地区、某些场所问题很突出，就必须进行集中整顿。在集中打击、集中整顿的同时，认真抓好制度建设，搞好综合治理。
    中共中央书记处候补书记温家宝，中央政法领导小组成员王芳、刘复之、贾春旺、蔡诚、周文元等，出席了座谈会。
    座谈会举行之前，赵紫阳、万里、乔石、温家宝、陈丕显、彭冲等同志会见了出席这次座谈会的全体代表。
