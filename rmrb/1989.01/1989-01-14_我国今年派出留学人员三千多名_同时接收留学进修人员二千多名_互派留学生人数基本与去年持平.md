	This year, the Chinese government, in accordance with bilateral agreements with other countries, will host over 2,000 students and scholars from more than 110 countries. Simultaneously, China will send over 3,000 students to more than 70 countries. The number of students exchanged is roughly the same as last year.

	A spokesperson from the State Education Commission said that, in addition to official exchanges of students, the government will also encourage universities and research institutions to engage in exchanges with their counterparts abroad, sending and receiving students.

	It is understood that last year, the number of students sent and received through university exchanges and individual institutions exceeded the number of government-sponsored students. Through university exchange programs, 1,500 foreign students came to China.

	The spokesperson said that currently, there are over 7,000 foreign students in China, including more than 2,000 undergraduate students and more than 2,000 visiting scholars. They are studying over 200 majors in various fields such as literature, science, engineering, agriculture, and medicine at Chinese universities.

	In recent years, the government has been gradually raising the level of students sent abroad, shifting from primarily sending undergraduate and graduate students to more visiting scholars and researchers. This is to meet the growing needs of domestic teaching and research. This year, the State Education Commission plans to select a group of high-level researchers who have obtained doctoral degrees domestically or abroad and send them abroad for postdoctoral research or internships.

　　我国今年派出留学人员三千多名
    同时接收留学进修人员二千多名
    互派留学生人数基本与去年持平
    新华社北京１月１３日电  （记者赵伟）１９８９年我国政府根据同其他国家政府的双边协议，将接收来自１１０多个国家的２０００多名留学、进修人员，同时向７０多个国家派出３０００多名留学人员，互派留学生的人数基本与去年持平。
    国家教委一位负责人说，除官方交换留学生外，国家还将鼓励高等院校、科研单位同国外对口的单位进行交流，互派留学人员。
    据悉，去年校际交流和单位自己派出留学进修人员已超过国家公派留学人员的人数，通过校际交流渠道来华的留学生有１５００名。
    这位负责人说，现在在华的留学人员已达７０００多人，其中本科生２０００多名、进修生２０００多名。他们在中国各大专院校主修文理工农医２００多个专业。
    近几年国家在逐渐提高派出留学人员的层次，由过去派本科生、研究生为主调整为更多地派遣进修人员和访问学者，以满足国内教学、科研工作不断发展的需要。今年国家教委计划选拔一批在国内外获得博士学位的高级研究人员，送到国外从事博士后研究或实习。
