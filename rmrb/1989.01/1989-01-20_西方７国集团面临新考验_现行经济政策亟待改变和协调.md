The Western Seven-Nation Group Faces New Challenges

The Existing Economic Policies Urgently Need to Be Changed and Coordinated

New China News Agency, Washington, January 16

The Wall Street Journal published an article today which opined that in order to make any significant progress in improving global trade imbalances, the Western Seven-Nation Group must make substantial and coordinated changes to their "core economic policies."

The members of the Western Seven-Nation Group are the United States, Britain, France, West Germany, Japan, Italy, and Canada.

The article states, "The challenge they currently face is to improve cooperation in structural policy and to address fiscal issues." The article points out that making changes to coordinated policies is the most difficult task, and the United States, Japan, and West Germany each have their own set of problems.

The article concludes by saying that for the common good, the member countries of the Seven-Nation Group must demonstrate the will to make difficult choices regarding their domestic policies.

　　西方７国集团面临新考验
    现行经济政策亟待改变和协调
    新华社华盛顿１月１６日电  美国《华尔街日报》今天发表的署名文章认为，要想在改善世界贸易失衡方面取得任何重大进展，西方７国集团就必须对“核心的经济政策作重大的和协调性改变”。
    西方７国集团成员国是美国、英国、法国、西德、日本、意大利和加拿大。
    文章说，“目前它们面临的挑战是改善结构性政策方面的合作和着手处理财政问题”。文章指出，对协调性政策作变动是最难办的事情，美、日、西德各自都有一些难题。
    文章最后说，为了共同的利益，７国集团的成员国必须表现对国内政策作艰难选择的意志。
