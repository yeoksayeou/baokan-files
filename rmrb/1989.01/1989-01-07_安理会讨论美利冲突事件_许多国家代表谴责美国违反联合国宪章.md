The Security Council Discusses the U.S.-Libya Conflict
Many Countries' Representatives Condemn the U.S. for Violating the UN Charter

Our reporter Liu Kai Cheng reports from the United Nations, January 5th: This afternoon, the United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting to discuss the incident where the U.S. Air Force shot down two Libyan planes in international waters in the Mediterranean yesterday. Many countries' representatives condemned the U.S. actions as violations of international law and the UN Charter, and demanded that the Security Council take effective measures to stop it.

This meeting was held at the request of the Libyan representative and the representative of Bahrain, as the chairman of the Arab Group for January. In addition to the representatives of the Council members, many other countries' representatives attended and spoke.

In his speech, the Libyan representative Ali Montasser condemned the U.S. for pursuing a policy of aggression against Libya since 1969. He said that the shooting down of the two Libyan reconnaissance planes was a prelude to a large-scale invasion of Libya. The U.S. fabricated the excuse that Libya's pharmaceutical factory was producing chemical weapons in order to attack Libya's economic and military facilities.

The Bahraini representative Abdulah Shakir, speaking on behalf of the Arab states group, expressed outrage at the U.S.'s "aggressive actions," pointing out that this incident threatened peace and security in the region and the world.

The Burkinabe representative Michel Da pointed out that the U.S. Sixth Fleet's actions in the Mediterranean, far from U.S. shores, created tension and were a provocation to the coastal states of the Mediterranean. The shooting down of the Libyan planes was an act of state terrorism against an independent country. This hegemonic policy should be condemned.

The Cuban representative Flores Prida said that at a time when international tensions were easing and cooperation was replacing confrontation, it was shocking that a superpower would take such barbaric actions against a Third World country. He pointed out that Libya had categorically denied manufacturing chemical weapons, and even if it were true, what right did the U.S. have to appoint itself as an international policeman to attack a small country?

The U.S. Deputy Representative Herbert Oken also spoke at the meeting, portraying the U.S. as the victim and repeating what the U.S. government had said yesterday—that this incident was a "self-defensive counterattack" forced upon the U.S. by Libyan planes' provocations.

The Syrian representative Ahmad Misri refuted this "self-defense" claim. He pointed out that it was absurd to say that Libya, with two small planes, intentionally provoked the powerful U.S. air and naval forces. In reality, it was the U.S. Navy's military exercises near the Libyan coast that were the true provocation.

The Security Council will continue its meeting tomorrow to deliberate on this issue.

### 安理会讨论美利冲突事件  许多国家代表谴责美国违反联合国宪章

　　安理会讨论美利冲突事件
    许多国家代表谴责美国违反联合国宪章
    本报联合国１月５日电  记者刘开宸报道：今天下午，联合国安理会召开紧急会议，讨论美国空军昨天在地中海国际水域上空击落两架利比亚飞机事件。许多国家代表谴责美国的行为违反了国际法准则和《联合国宪章》，要求安理会采取有效措施加以制止。
    这次会议是应利比亚代表和作为阿拉伯集团１月份主席的巴林代表的要求而召开的。除理事国代表出席会议外，其他许多国家代表列席并发言。
    在发言中，利比亚代表阿里·蒙塔塞尔谴责美国自１９６９年以来一直奉行侵略利比亚的政策，这次击落两架利比亚侦察机，是大规模侵略利比亚的先声。美国捏造利比亚药厂制造化学武器的借口，企图袭击利比亚的经济和军事设施。
    巴林代表阿卜杜拉·沙卡尔代表阿拉伯国家集团对美国的“侵略行径”表示愤慨，指出这一事件威胁该地区和世界的和平与安全。
    布基纳法索代表米歇尔·达指出，美国第六舰队跑到离美国很远的地中海制造紧张，是对地中海沿岸国家的挑衅。美国击落利比亚飞机则是反对一个独立国家的国家恐怖主义的行为。这种强权政策应受到谴责。
    古巴代表弗劳雷斯·普里达说，当国际紧张局势趋于缓和，合作代替对抗之时，一个超级大国竟对第三世界的一个国家采取如此野蛮的行动是令人吃惊的。他指出，利比亚已断然否认在制造化学武器的事，即使有此事，美国有何权利自封为国际宪兵来攻击一个小国？
    美国副代表赫伯特·奥肯也在会上发言，把美国说成是受害者，并重复了美国政府昨天所说的，这一事件是美国对付利比亚飞机挑衅而被迫采取的“自卫还击”。
    叙利亚代表艾赫迈德·米斯里驳斥了这种“自卫”的说法。他指出，美国说利比亚用两架小飞机有意对美国强大的空军和海军进行挑衅，这在军事上和逻辑上都是站不住脚的。实际上，美海军在利比亚海岸附近进行军事演习，才是真正的挑衅。
    安理会明天将继续开会，审议此问题。
