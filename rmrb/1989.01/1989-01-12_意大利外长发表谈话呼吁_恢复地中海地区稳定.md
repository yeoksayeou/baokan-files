Italian Foreign Minister Andreotti today said that restoring stability in the Mediterranean region and maintaining and strengthening its political and strategic balance is in everyone's interest.

Andreotti made the remarks at a joint meeting of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committees of the Chamber of Deputies. He said that stability is a necessary condition for promoting cooperation among Mediterranean countries and resolving the Arab-Israeli conflict.

He said that Italy's Middle East policy is not ambiguous; it promotes dialogue between the conflicting parties together with other European Community countries.

In discussing Italy's relations with Libya, Andreotti said that Libya has recently shown a shift towards "less radicalism," and its foreign policy is moving towards cooperation with the countries of the Maghreb region.

This trend should be encouraged, he said, as it will help in resolving the Palestinian issue.

　　意大利外长发表谈话呼吁
    恢复地中海地区稳定
    新华社罗马１月１０日电  意大利外长安德烈奥蒂今天说，恢复地中海地区的稳定，使其政治和战略平衡得到维护和加强符合大家的利益。
    安德烈奥蒂是在众议院外事和国防委员会举行联席会议时发表上述谈话的。他说，形势稳定是促进地中海沿岸国家合作和解决阿以冲突必不可少的条件。
    他说，意大利的中东政策并不是模棱两可的，它同欧洲共同体其他国家一起促进冲突双方对话。
    在谈到意大利同利比亚的关系时，安德烈奥蒂说，利比亚最近向“较少的激进主义”变化，其外交政策正走向与马格里布地区国家合作。
    这种倾向应该得到鼓励，这有助于巴勒斯坦问题的解决。
