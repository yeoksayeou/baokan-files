The Yingkou Drug Materials Procurement and Supply Station in Liaoning Province has established a "rebate" accounting system, with leaders leading by example in maintaining integrity, and employees actively resisting improper practices in purchasing and sales activities.

Over the past two years, the station has signed more than 2,500 procurement and sales contracts, with a transaction amount of 50 million yuan. To date, no cases of bribery have been found, and the rebate funds accounted for amount to over 400,000 yuan.

The station has 113 employees and is responsible for the second and third-level wholesale business of Chinese patent medicines and Chinese herbal medicines. During purchasing and sales activities, they often encounter situations where the other party offers gifts or rebates. In February last year, after Dong Yushan took over as manager, he strengthened ideological education for the employees on one hand, and on the other hand, formulated strict regulations. It was stipulated that rebate funds must be turned in and handled uniformly by the station; otherwise, it would be treated as embezzlement of public funds. To prevent personal favoritism in procurement, it was stipulated that all signed contracts must go through four levels of review by the planning officer, contract officer, department head, and manager. It is not allowed to do business with clients who have a poor reputation. The rebate and its amount must be clearly stated on the contract, and if there are any doubts, the contract must be immediately canceled. All contracts are made public and subject to public supervision.

　　营口药材站建立“回扣”入帐制
    本报讯辽宁省营口药材采购供应站建立“回扣”入帐制，领导带头讲廉洁，职工自觉抵制购销活动中的不正之风。
    两年来，该站签订购销合同２５００多份，成交金额达５０００万元，至今未发现１人受贿，“回扣款”入帐金额达４万余元。
    该站共有１１３人，担负着中成药和中药材二、三级批发业务。在购销活动中，常遇到对方送礼，给“回扣”等。去年２月，东玉山出任经理后，一方面加强对职工思想教育，一方面制订了严格的制度，规定回扣款一律上交，由站里统一处理，否则按贪污公款处理。为了防止人情采购，规定所订合同必须通过计划员、合同员、主管科长、经理４道关口审查；不准与信誉不好的客户做买卖；“回扣”及其金额一律要在合同上注明，有疑点的，立即撤销合同；各项合同公开，接受群众监督。
