To further leverage the role of experts in planning and decision-making, the State Council has approved the establishment of an expert group for drafting China's medium and long-term science and technology development outline.

Since the founding of the People's Republic, China has formulated several science and technology plans, including the 12-year science and technology development blueprint in 1956 and subsequent plans. These plans have played significant historical roles in the development of science and technology, as well as in the construction of the national economy and national defense. Drafting a medium and long-term science and technology development outline, which is at a higher level than these plans, is being done for the first time.

The expert group is led by Jiang Minkuan as the chairman, with Zhang Wei, Zhu Guangya, Wang Fusuo, and Lu Yucheng serving as vice chairmen. The group also includes 16 other experts from various fields as members.

The expert group recently held its first meeting to discuss several issues related to the drafting of the "outline."

　　制定中长期科技发展纲领    
    国务院已批准成立专家组
    据新华社北京１月２１日电  为进一步发挥专家在规划决策工作中的作用，经国务院批准，国家制定中长期科技发展纲领的起草工作专家组最近成立。
    我国自建国以来，已先后制定过１９５６年的１２年科技发展远景规划以及此后的其他几个科技规划，对科技发展以至国民经济和国防建设都发挥过重要的历史作用。而制定比规划更高的中长期科技发展纲领，这还是第一次。
    专家组由蒋民宽任组长，张维、朱光亚、王佛松、陆宇澄任副组长，其他１６名各方面专家任成员。
    专家组日前召开了它的第一次会议，就“纲领”起草工作中的若干问题进行了研究。
