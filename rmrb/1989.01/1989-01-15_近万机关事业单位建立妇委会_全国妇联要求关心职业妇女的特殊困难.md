Nearly 10,000 government and public institutions have established women's committees. The All-China Women's Federation has called for attention to the special difficulties faced by working women.

The People's Daily, Beijing, January 14th -- Reporter Feng Yuan learned from the All-China Women's Federation that women in professional and intellectual fields have gradually established their own organizations. Nearly 10,000 units in the fields of science, education, culture, health, and party and government agencies have set up women's committees.

At today's meeting in Beijing to exchange experiences in women's committee work, women workers and party committee leaders from the Ministry of Finance and other units introduced the work of their women's committees. According to statistics, female cadres account for 30% of the total number of cadres in central government agencies. There are about 220,000 female workers and cadres in central state organs, accounting for one-third of the total number of cadres and workers. These female workers have high political and cultural qualities, a reasonable age structure, and a strong sense of duty. Huang Qixian, Vice Chairman and Secretary of the Secretariat of the All-China Women's Federation, said that they have their own special difficulties and need care and help. The women's work in party and government agencies, and in the fields of science, education, culture, and health, needs to be strengthened, and a team of part-time women workers needs to be formed.
