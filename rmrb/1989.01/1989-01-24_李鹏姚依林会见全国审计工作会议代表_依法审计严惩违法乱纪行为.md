Li Peng and Yao Yilin Meet with Representatives of the National Audit Work Conference
	Depend on Law to Audit and Severely Punish Illegal and Disciplinary Violations

	New China News Agency Beijing January 23rd - During the recent National Audit Work Conference, Premier Li Peng and Vice Premier Yao Yilin met with all the representatives, listened to their reports, and delivered important speeches.

	Li Peng emphasized that audit work should implement the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, playing an important role in establishing a new order of socialist planned commodity economy and a macro-control system during the rectification and rectification process, and will continue to play a long-term role. Audit work supports reform and opening up, and strengthening audit work is to ensure that reform and opening up develop more healthily. We have implemented the policies of reform and opening up, which have greatly developed the national economy, and this should be fully affirmed. However, some negative elements have also taken advantage of the situation, so it is necessary to strengthen supervision, strictly enforce the law, investigate problems, and punish them according to law, making an example of one to warn the rest, and forming a deterrent to illegal and disciplinary violations.

	Li Peng said that in the past five years since the audit work was launched, it has played a good role in ensuring reform and opening up, promoting economic stability and development, and maintaining normal economic order. Practice has proven that strengthening audit supervision is a component of strengthening macro-control, and it is completely necessary for our country to establish an audit system. Starting from the current situation of the audit team, it is necessary to implement a combination of universal and key audits. Audit work should gradually achieve regularization, institutionalization, and standardization, forming a complete system.

	Li Peng pointed out that all levels of party committees and governments should actively support audit work, have the responsibility to protect the audit personnel's legal audit supervision rights. Necessary working conditions should also be provided for audit cadres to maintain relative stability. In some places, the problems found by audits may affect the improper interests of local areas or small groups. If audit personnel are retaliated against for this, it must be seriously investigated and dealt with.

	Li Peng said that the audit agencies' legal independent exercise of audit supervision rights is a power granted by the Constitution. Wherever there is economic activity, audits must be conducted according to law, and this should be institutionalized and become a regular work.

	When talking about the construction of audit agencies, Li Peng said that audit agencies are a department that needs to be strengthened in the government institutional reform. Not only should the number of audit personnel be increased, but also the quality of audit personnel should be improved. Audit agencies are responsible for supervision and should take the lead in being clean and honest in their work.

	Yao Yilin said that the relevant provisions of the Constitution on audits and the State Council's issued Audit Regulations must be strictly implemented. Compromises cannot be made for behaviors that violate the Constitution and audit regulations. The principles of having laws to follow, strict law enforcement, and punishing lawbreakers must be upheld. The unhealthy tendencies that currently obstruct audit work must be fought against to establish the authority of audit supervision.

	Yao Yilin pointed out that the function of audit agencies is to conduct supervision. In the past period, some places have required audit agencies to be flexible and adaptable, relax policies, and do more service and less supervision, which is a wrong approach. We must always do both, on the one hand, reform and open up, on the other hand, strengthen supervision and management.

	Yao Yilin said that it is very necessary to conduct tracking audits on basic construction projects that have been decided to stop or slow down. Not only should it be supervised whether they have truly stopped or slowed down, but also whether there are serious losses, waste, and opportunities for embezzlement during and after the stop or slowdown.

	State Councilor Wang Shoudao, State Council Secretary-General Luo Gan, and relevant department heads attended the meeting.

　　李鹏姚依林会见全国审计工作会议代表    
    依法审计严惩违法乱纪行为
    新华社北京１月２３日电  国务院总理李鹏、副总理姚依林在最近召开的全国审计工作会议期间，接见了全体代表，听取了汇报，并作了重要讲话。
    李鹏强调，审计工作要贯彻十三届三中全会精神，在治理、整顿中为建立社会主义有计划的商品经济新秩序和宏观调控体系发挥重要作用，并将长期起作用。审计工作是支持改革、开放的，加强审计工作是为了改革、开放更加健康地发展。我们执行改革、开放的方针，使国民经济有了很大发展，这是应当充分肯定的。但一些消极的东西也趁机而入，因此，必须加强监督，严格执法，查出了问题，就要依法惩处，惩一儆百，形成对违法乱纪行为的一种威慑力量。
    李鹏说，审计工作开展五年来，对保证改革、开放，促进经济稳定发展，维护经济正常秩序，起了很好的作用。实践证明，加强审计监督，是加强宏观调控的一个组成部分，我们国家建立审计制度是完全必要的。从现在审计队伍的实际情况出发，要实行普遍审计和重点审计相结合。审计工作要逐步实现经常化、制度化、规范化，形成一个完整的体系。
    李鹏指出，各级党委、政府要积极支持审计工作，有责任保护审计人员依法行使审计监督权。还要为审计干部提供必要的工作条件，使他们保持相对稳定。有的地方审计查出的一些问题，可能影响到地方或小团体某些不正当的利益，如果审计人员因此遭到打击报复，一定要严肃查处。
    李鹏说，审计机关依法独立行使审计监督权是宪法赋予的权力。凡有经济活动的地方，都要依法进行审计，这要形成制度，成为一项经常性的工作。
    在谈到审计机关建设时，李鹏说，审计机关在政府机构改革中是一个需要加强的部门。不仅要增加审计人员数量，还要提高审计人员素质。审计机关是搞监督的，要带头作到为政清廉。
    姚依林说，必须坚决执行《宪法》中有关审计的规定和国务院发布的《审计条例》，对违反宪法和审计条例的行为不能采取妥协的办法，要做到有法必依，执法必严，违法必究。对目前存在着的阻碍审计工作的不健康倾向，要进行斗争，才能树立审计监督的权威。
    姚依林指出，审计机关的职能就是搞监督。前段时间有些地方要求审计机关灵活变通，放宽政策，多搞服务，少搞监督，这种提法是错误的。我们始终要两手抓，一方面要改革、开放，一方面要加强监督管理。
    姚依林说，对基本建设决定停缓建项目实行跟踪审计，非常必要。不仅要监督是否真正停缓建了，而且要检查停缓建中和停缓建后有没有严重损失浪费和乘机贪污的问题。
    国务委员王丙乾、国务院秘书长罗干和有关部门的负责人参加了会见。
