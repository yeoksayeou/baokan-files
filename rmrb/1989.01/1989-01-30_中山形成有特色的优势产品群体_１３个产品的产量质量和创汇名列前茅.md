Zhongshan Forms a Distinctive Advantage Product Group

    13 Products Lead in Production, Quality, and Foreign Exchange Earnings

    According to Xinhua News Agency (reporters Qie Xiu and Zhang Yu Sheng), Guangdong's Zhongshan City has continuously optimized its product structure, gradually forming a group of distinctive advantage products that have strong local characteristics and competitive advantages.

    According to statistics from the end of 1988, the rate of high-quality products in the city's industrial products reached 21%, with the rate of high-quality products in municipal industries reaching 36%. A total of 140 products have successively won national or ministry/provincial high-quality product titles, among which 13 products lead in production, quality, and export earnings among similar products nationwide.

    Since the reform and opening up, Zhongshan City has leveraged its geographical advantage of being close to Hong Kong and Macau to selectively introduce a batch of advanced technologies and equipment. It has transformed the originally weak industrial base, gradually forming an industrial layout with local characteristics. Currently, the city has 16 industries, including sugar production, papermaking, chemicals, electronics, household appliances, textiles, glass, and building materials, producing more than 3,000 products. Among them, the "Weili" brand washing machines, "Qianye" brand electric fans, "Juhua" brand glass mosaics, "Qiangli" brand fine chemical aerosol sprays, and galvanized small-diameter steel pipes are 10 major product series that have gained fame both domestically and internationally. In 1988, these 10 products achieved a total output value of 1 billion yuan, realized a profit of 60 million yuan, and paid 47 million yuan in taxes, accounting for 52%, 63%, and 41% of the total industrial output value, profit, and tax revenue of municipal industries, respectively. In addition, Zhongshan City has well-known products such as piano-style switches and various amusement machines. According to statistics, out of every 10 electric fans and washing machines produced in China with piano-style switches, 6 come from Xiaolan Switch Factory in Zhongshan City. More than 50% of the bumper cars, flying saucer cars, and laser shooting games in entertainment venues across the country also come from Zhongshan.

　　中山形成有特色的优势产品群体   
    １３个产品的产量质量和创汇名列前茅
    据新华社电（记者戚休、张愈升）广东中山市不断优化产品结构，逐步形成了既有地方特色、又有较强竞争能力的优势产品群体。
    据１９８８年底统计，全市工业产品的优质品率达２１％，其中市属工业的优质品率高达３６％；有１４０个产品先后荣获国家或部、省优质产品称号，其中１３个产品的产量、质量和出口创汇额在全国同类产品中名列前茅。
    改革开放以来，中山市凭借邻近港澳的地理优势，有选择地引进了一批先进技术和设备，对原来基础比较薄弱的工业进行改造，逐步形成了具有本地特色的工业布局。目前这个市已拥有制糖、造纸、化工、电子、家用电器、纺织、玻璃、建材等１６个行业，３０００多种产品。其中“威力”牌洗衣机、“千叶”牌电风扇、“菊花”牌玻璃马赛克、“强力”牌精细化工气雾剂、镀锌小口径钢管等１０个大宗系列产品，已在国内外叫响。１９８８年，这１０个产品合计完成产值１０亿元，实现利润６０００万元，税金４７００万元，分别占市属工业产值、利润、税金总额的５２％、６３％和４１％。除此之外，中山市有名气的产品还有琴键式开关和各种游艺机。据统计，我国生产的带有琴键式开关的电风扇和洗衣机，每１０台中有６台的开关来自中山市小榄开关厂。全国各地娱乐场所的碰碰车、飞碟车、激光射击等游艺机，５０％以上也来自中山。
