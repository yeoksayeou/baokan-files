In the year just passed, China's opening-up policy maintained a strong momentum of development. The total volume of import and export trade is expected to reach $10 billion, an increase of approximately 21% over the previous year.

According to the National Bureau of Statistics, in 1988, China's foreign trade system underwent significant reforms. The contract responsibility system was fully implemented, and industrial sectors actively participated in international competition and exchange. The annual export contract plan was completed one quarter ahead of schedule. The total export volume is expected to increase by about $7 billion, a growth rate of approximately 18% over the previous year.

China's foreign trade methods have become increasingly diversified, and trade partners have expanded. In 1988, the export volume from flexible trade methods such as compensatory trade, processing trade, offset contract trade, processing and assembly trade, and border trade exceeded $13 billion. While maintaining growth in trade with Hong Kong, Macao, Japan, the United States, and Western Europe, China has further strengthened its trade relations with ASEAN, the Middle East, and Latin American developing countries. Currently, China has established economic and trade relations with 180 countries and regions.

The structure of imported and exported goods has been further improved. Among the exported goods, industrial manufactured products have seen the fastest growth, with an increase of approximately 30%. Products such as televisions, radios, ships, watches, jewelry, toys, and clothing have entered the international market in large quantities. The export of machinery and electrical products has been aggressive, with an export volume of nearly $4.5 billion in the first 10 months of 1988 alone, an increase of approximately 60% over the same period last year. Televisions have become China's first single-item export electrical product with an annual export volume exceeding $1 billion.

The scale of utilizing foreign capital has continued to expand, and the structure of "three types of enterprises" has become more rational. In 1988, an average of more than 13 foreign capital utilization projects were signed daily nationwide, with a contract amount of over $10 billion. Foreign-invested enterprises have developed rapidly, with an estimated 5,000 new "three types of enterprises" approved nationwide, equivalent to about half of the total number of "three types of enterprises" in the previous 9 years. Wholly foreign-owned enterprises have emerged, with 240 approved nationwide from January to November 1988 alone, nearly five times the number of the previous year. The focus of "three types of enterprises" has shifted to the production sector, with a majority being technologically advanced and export-oriented.

　　我国对外开放发展势头旺盛
    去年贸易总额预计可达一千亿美元
    新华社北京１月１日电  （记者吴士深）在刚刚过去的１年里，我国对外开放继续保持旺盛发展势头，进出口贸易总额预计可达１０００亿美元，比上年增长２１％左右。
    据国家统计局介绍，１９８８年我国外贸体制实行重大改革，全面推行承包经营责任制，工业部门积极参与国际竞争与交换，全年外贸出口承包计划提前一个季度完成。出口总额预计比上年增加约７０亿美元，增长幅度为１８％左右。
    我国对外贸易方式日趋多样化，“贸易伙伴”向多样化发展。１９８８年补偿贸易、进料加工贸易、对口合同贸易、来料加工装配贸易、边境地方贸易等灵活贸易方式的出口额超过１３０亿美元。在保持对港澳、日本、美国和西欧等国家和地区贸易增长的同时，我国同东盟、中东及拉美等发展中国家的贸易往来进一步加强。目前我国已与１８０个国家和地区建立了经济贸易联系。
    进出口商品结构进一步改善。在出口商品中，工业制成品增长最快，增幅为３０％左右。电视机、收音机、船舶、钟表、首饰、玩具、服装等已大量进入国际市场。机电产品出口攻势猛烈，仅１９８８年头１０个月出口额就近４５亿美元，比上年同期增长约６０％。电视机已经成为我国第一个年出口额超过１亿美元的单项出口机电产品。
    利用外资规模不断扩大，“三资”企业结构趋向合理。１９８８年全国平均每天签订利用外资项目合同１３个以上，外资协议额达１００多亿美元。外商投资企业发展势头迅猛，全国新批准举办“三资”企业估计达５０００家左右，相当于前９年“三资”企业总数的一半左右。外商独资企业异军突起，仅１９８８年１至１１月份全国就批准兴办２４０家，比上年增长近５倍。“三资”企业重点已转向生产性领域，以技术先进型和出口型居多。
