Due to advancements in diving technology, marine scientists have discovered many peculiar life phenomena in the deep sea.

In the eastern Pacific Ocean at a depth of 3,000 meters, sunlight cannot penetrate, and it is completely dark. The water temperature is also very low, so logically, there should be no signs of life. However, in recent years, large clams, shellfish, and worms have been found here. Some of these worms can grow up to 3 meters in length. Scientists believe that these animals' habitats are near the lava of underwater volcanoes, where the water temperature is higher than in the surrounding deep-sea water and contains more minerals. The plants and animals in this area have a unique life system that can convert the heat energy from the volcano into biological energy in an environment where sunlight is not directly available. Some people also believe that the shellfish and worms growing here have bacteria in their bodies that can decompose sulfur in the seawater, providing an inexhaustible source of energy for their life activities.

In the Gulf of Mexico, about 220 kilometers west of Florida, there are no volcanoes on the seabed, and the water temperature is very low. However, similar animals have also been found there. The reason is that several places in Florida have discovered sulfur seeping to the surface. Therefore, it is possible that the seabed of the Gulf of Mexico also emits this mineral, providing the necessary energy for the life activities of deep-sea animals.

　　深海动物的生命之谜
    由于潜水技术的提高，海洋科学家在深海发现了许多奇特的生命现象。
    太平洋东部３０００米深的海底透不进阳光，完全是一片漆黑，水温又低，按理说是不会有生命现象的。可是近年来却在这里发现了巨大的蛤类、贝壳类、蠕虫类等动物，有些蠕虫竟长达３米。科学家们以为这些动物的聚居地靠近海底火山的熔岩，水温比同一深度的海水要高，并含有较多的矿物质。这一带的动植物，体内有一种特殊的生命系统，在无法直接得到太阳能的不利环境中，能把火山里的热能转化成生物能。还有人认为，生长在这里的贝壳类和蠕虫类动物，体内有一种细菌能分解海水中的硫，为生命活动提供了取之不尽的能源。
    在墨西哥湾离佛罗里达州西面２２０公里的地方，海底没有火山，水温很低，可是也发现了上述动物。什么原因？原来佛罗里达州有几处地方发现过渗出地表的硫，那么墨西哥湾的海底也可能冒出这种矿物质，为深海动物提供生命活动需要的能源。　　　　　（１９８８年１２月１３日《科技日报》　心羽文）
