Afghan Resistance Forces Reject Soviet Invitation for Talks

New China News Agency Islamabad January 9th: According to sources from the Afghan resistance forces, the Afghan Seven-Party Alliance has rejected the Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister's proposal for a third round of direct talks between the Soviet Union and the Afghan resistance forces in Moscow.

The source said that the current chairman of the Seven-Party Alliance, Sibghatullah Mojaddedi, has stated that it is impossible for the leaders of the Afghan resistance forces to accept the invitation to visit the Soviet Union while Soviet troops are still in Afghanistan and the Soviet-backed regime is still in power.

However, he said that it might be possible for the leaders of the resistance forces to visit the Soviet Union after the establishment of an Islamic Mujahideen government in Afghanistan. This would depend on the future relations between the Soviet Union and Afghanistan.

According to sources close to the resistance forces, the Afghan resistance forces have expressed their willingness to continue dialogue with the Soviet Union. They would not object to holding the talks in a neutral country.

　　阿抵抗力量拒绝去苏联会谈
    新华社伊斯兰堡１月９日电  据阿富汗抵抗力量人士今天透露，阿富汗七党联盟已经拒绝苏联副外长关于在莫斯科举行苏联和阿抵抗力量的第三轮直接会谈的建议。
    这位人士说，七党联盟现任主席西卜加图拉·穆贾迪迪已经表示，苏联军队仍在阿富汗以及苏联扶植的政权还在台上的情况下要阿富汗抵抗力量领导人接受邀请去访问苏联是根本不可能的。
    但是，他说，在阿富汗成立伊斯兰圣战者政府以后抵抗力量领导人访苏也许是可能的，这还要看苏、阿将来的关系如何而定了。
    另据接近抵抗力量的人士透露，阿富汗抵抗力量表示愿意和苏联继续对话，他们将不反对会谈在一个中立国家举行。
