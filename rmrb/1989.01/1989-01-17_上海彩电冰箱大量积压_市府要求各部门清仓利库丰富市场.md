	Shanghai's stockpile of color TVs and refrigerators is growing rapidly. The municipal government has ordered various departments to clear their inventories and enrich the market.

	According to the New China News Agency, Shanghai, January 16 (Reporter Wu Fumin) Currently, color TVs, refrigerators, and brand-name bicycles are in high demand, and citizens are eagerly awaiting them. However, surprisingly, these scarce commodities, which are hard to find in the market, are piling up in the warehouses of Shanghai's commercial departments.

	The statistics provided by the Shanghai Municipal Planning Commission, Economic Commission, and Municipal Statistics Bureau, although differing due to variations in statistical scope, reveal the severity of the situation:

	In 1988, the total inventory of commercial departments included 77,500 color TVs (some sources say 60,000 units), an increase of 70% from the beginning of the year; 1,842,000 bicycles (some sources say 1,880,000 units, others say 1,217,000 units), at least a 42.5% increase from the beginning of the year; 55,000 refrigerators (some sources say 77,000 units, others say 43,400 units), at least a 12% increase from the beginning of the year. Additionally, the Metallurgical Bureau has 100,000 tons of finished steel products in stock, more than double the amount at the beginning of the year; 1,140,000 tons of steel ingots and billets are backlogged, and if 200,000 tons are reduced, 200 million yuan can be freed up; 800,000 boxes of cigarettes are backlogged, and if 300,000 boxes are reduced, 120 million yuan can be freed up.

	The reasons for the increase in the inventory of scarce commodities are varied: industrial departments want to wait for the opportunity to sell to other regions to return some profits; commercial departments want to "drip-feed" and sell some slow-moving commodities; relevant leading departments want to keep them in hand to exchange for scarce resources. From the perspective of each department, these actions seem reasonable, but their negative consequences cannot be ignored: on one hand, citizens are frustrated and complaining about not being able to find these fashionable commodities; on the other hand, "active money" in the warehouse has become "dead money."

	The Shanghai Municipal Government recently held a special meeting to issue a "yellow card warning" for this abnormal phenomenon, requiring various departments to seriously clear their inventories and quickly release scarce commodities into the market. The municipal government decided that "whoever clears the inventory, most of the freed-up funds will belong to them."

　　上海彩电冰箱大量积压
    市府要求各部门清仓利库丰富市场
    据新华社上海１月１６日电  （记者吴复民）时下，彩电、冰箱、名牌自行车炙手可热，市民翘首以待。然而，令人惊愕的是，这类紧俏商品虽在市场上难以买到，而在上海工商部门的仓库里却越积越多。
    上海市计委、经委，市统计局等部门提供的数字虽由于统计口径等原因而不尽相同，但情况的严重性已足见一斑：
    １９８８年工商部门总库存量，彩色电视机７．７５万台（一说６万余台），比年初增加７０％；自行车１８４．２万辆（一说１８８万辆，又一说１２１．７万辆），至少比年初增加４２．５％；电冰箱５．５万台（一说７．７万台，又一说４．３４万台），至少比年初增加１２％。此外，冶金局的成品钢材库存１０万吨，比年初增加１倍多；钢锭钢坯积压１１４万吨，如果压缩２０万吨，就可挖掘资金２亿元；卷烟积压８万大箱，如果压缩３万箱，就是１．２亿元。
    造成紧俏商品库存增加的原因很多：工业部门想待机销往外地，以返回一部分利润；商业部门想“细水长流”，搭售部分滞销商品；有关领导部门则想抓在手里，赖以串换紧缺物资。站在各个部门的立场上考虑问题，似乎都情有可原，但其消极后果却不容漠视：一方面，市民为觅不到这些时髦商品叫苦不迭，牢骚满腹；另方面，“活钱”在仓库里搁煞变成了“死钱”。
    上海市人民政府日前专门召开会议，对这种反常现象出示了“黄牌警告”，要求各部门认真清仓利库，尽快将紧俏商品投放市场。市政府决定“谁清库，腾出的资金大部分归谁使用”。
