	Several months later, they finally found him.

	The couple, Mr. and Mrs. Duan Wensheng, were rescued from the water and sat by the riverbank, catching their breath, their hearts still pounding. By the time they came to their senses, the person who had saved them had already left.

	The incident occurred on the morning of August 21 last year. Mr. Duan Wensheng, a worker from the Fourth Construction Company in Beijing's Xijiang District, and his wife were washing clothes by the river near Maizhong Bridge with their two children. Suddenly, their older child, who was playing by the shore, fell into the water. His mother, Zhang Shuxian, rushed to pull him out. The boy, who was already in middle school, was strong and did not know how to swim, pulling his mother into the water instead. The younger Duan girl, seeing this, cried out and ran to call her father, who was hanging clothes nearby. Duan Wensheng heard the cries and rushed to the riverbank, but slipped and fell, dislocating both elbows. He endured the pain and jumped into the water, using his feet to push the boy towards the shore. Then he went to save his wife. Already injured and not a strong swimmer, he struggled with his wife in the water and both went under, only their hands flailing above the surface. The situation was dire, and the two children were crying loudly. Many people watched from the shore, but no one went to help. Just then, a middle-aged man walking his child by the river saw the scene and quickly pushed through the crowd, leaving his child and jumping into the river fully clothed. He struggled against the current and the flailing couple, swallowing several mouthfuls of water, before finally pulling them to safety.

	Afterwards, the Duan couple searched everywhere for their savior but found no trace of him. Several months passed, and one day, the middle-aged man returned to the riverbank for a walk. A young woman named Li, who lived nearby, recognized him and immediately ran to tell Duan Wensheng. The Duan couple rushed over and indeed found their savior. His name was Su Ruguang, a staff member of the Li ethnic group at the Central Institute for Nationalities' Museum of Nationalities.

	The Duan couple were deeply moved and insisted on repaying Su Ruguang, but he declined. Duan Wensheng said that he had often read in the newspapers about bystanders not helping drowning victims, but never expected that when they were in danger, they would encounter such a selfless and noble person. They would forever learn from Su Ruguang's spirit.

　　几个月后才找到了他
    明妍
    段文生夫妇被人从水中救上岸来，惊魂未定，坐在河边上喘着粗气。当他们清醒过来时，营救他们的人早已离去了。
    事情发生在去年８月２１日的上午。北京西郊四季青建筑二公司工人段文生与妻子带着两个孩子在麦钟桥运河边洗衣服。忽然，在岸边玩耍的大孩子落进水里，他母亲张淑珍慌忙去拉。这个已上初中的男孩劲大，又不会游泳，反倒把他母亲拖下了水。站在岸边的段家小姑娘见此情景一面哭一面跑去喊叫在远处晾晒衣服的爸爸。段文生听到呼救声赶忙向河边奔跑，不慎踩到滑处，一跤跌倒，双肘骨头错位。他忍痛跳进水中，用脚把孩子踢向岸边，再去救妻子。他已受伤，又不大会游泳，所以和妻子拉扯在一起时，不由自主地便沉下水去，只有两双手还在水面上乱抓。情况十分危急，两个孩子哇哇大哭。岸上观看的人不少，却没有人下去搭救。正在这时，一位带小孩到河边散步的中年人走过来，见此情景，忙推开众人，丢下孩子，连衣服都没有脱便跳入河中，向遇险者游去。段家夫妇身材高大，又因惊慌而胡乱挣扎，中年人费了好大的劲，呛了好几口水，才把他俩救上岸来。
    事后，段家夫妇四处寻找这位救命的人，都不见踪迹。时间过去了几个月，一天，那位中年人又来到河边散步，恰被一位住在附近姓李的姑娘认出了，她立即跑去告诉段文生。段家夫妇赶来一看，果然是他们的救命恩人。这位中年人名叫苏儒光，是中央民族学院民族博物馆的黎族干部。
    段文生夫妇非常激动，一定要酬谢苏儒光，但被谢绝了。段文生说，以前常从报上看到众人围观落水者而不救的消息，没想到他们遇险时，却遇到了这样一位无私而高尚的人，他们一家人将永远学习苏儒光的这种精神。
