Nanjing Steel Rolling Mill recently introduced a new type of cold-rolled threaded steel to the market, filling a domestic gap.

This new steel material, which has only been developed in foreign countries in recent years and is widely used in Western Europe, is characterized by high tensile strength, good plasticity, and excellent bonding with concrete. It is suitable for use in multi-story buildings and components for power systems and municipal engineering. Compared to hot-rolled threaded steel, it can reduce the amount of steel used in prefabricated concrete by 15%, significantly improving the quality and safety of the components. Relevant national authorities have recommended this ideal material-saving product nationwide.

    南京生产出冷轧螺纹钢
  　南京轧钢总厂新近向市场推出一种大幅度节省用量的冷轧螺纹钢，填补了国内空白。
    这种新钢材近几年在国外才发展起来，在西欧已得到广泛应用。它主要以抗拉强度高、可塑性好、对混凝土有较好粘结性等特点适用于多层建筑和电力系统、市政工程的构件中。与热轧螺纹钢相比，它可以减少预制混凝土用钢量１５％，并可以大幅度提高构件的质量和安全度。国家有关部门已向全国推荐这种理想的节材产品。
