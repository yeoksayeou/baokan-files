In the prime of life, imprisoned; in old age, reborn
Houma City Court overturns a wrongful conviction

On December 10th of last year, officials from Houma City People's Court in Shanxi Province and related departments delivered a payment notice to a blind elderly man.

This elderly man is named He Hongfei, 73 years old, from Xili Village, Houma City, Shanxi Province. From 1945 to 1946, He served as the company commander of the 34th Regiment, 12th Division, 4th Army of the Nationalist Party's Shanxi Defense Force. Due to work needs, underground party worker Zhao Yangtai, through educational work, required him to use his special identity to gather intelligence for our party.

In July 1946, He, on the orders of our underground party, escorted underground courier Wang Yulin out of Linfen City. When passing through Xiangling (now Xiangfen County), Wang Yulin was killed by the bandits of Yan. Upon learning of this in Linfen, He immediately returned to Houma to report to the party organization, but was suspected.

In 1951, He Hongfei was arrested and sentenced to nine years in prison for historical counter-revolutionary crimes. The repeated political movements left him despairing. In 1985, during a review of historical wrongful convictions, Houma City People's Court discovered this case. They immediately established a special investigation team. To clarify the facts, the investigators traveled over ten thousand kilometers to Xi'an, Guangzhou, and other places to investigate and gather evidence. Due to the length of time since the case and the complex historical background, as well as the fact that most of the informed parties had already passed away, the investigation faced significant difficulties. However, the investigators, with a strong sense of responsibility, did not overlook any minor clues. They finally clarified the facts, proving that He Hongfei was a formal intelligence scout developed by our party from among the enemy's personnel.

In June 1988, Houma City People's Court ruled that the original judgment in He Hongfei's historical counter-revolutionary case was based on unclear facts. The suspicion that Wang Yulin was harmed due to He's betrayal was unfounded. According to Article 149 of the "Criminal Procedure Law of the People's Republic of China," the original judgment was revoked, and He Hongfei was declared not guilty, thus overturning the 37-year wrongful conviction against this elderly man.

To ensure that the elderly man enjoys his later years, Houma City People's Court actively coordinated with relevant departments, and the relevant departments provided 1,500 yuan in assistance for his living expenses.

　　而立之年陷囹圄古稀之年获新生    
    侯马市法院平反一起冤案
    去年１２月１０日，山西省侯马市人民法院和有关部门的工作人员将一张领款通知单，送到了一位双目失明的老人手中。
    这位老人叫郝鸿飞，今年７３岁，是山西省侯马市西里村人。１９４５年至１９４６年期间，郝曾任国民党山西省防军第４军１２师３４团某连连长，因工作需要，我地下党工作者赵养泰通过教育工作要求他利用特殊身份为我党搜集情报。
    １９４６年７月的一天，郝奉我地下党之命，护送地下交通员王玉林出临汾城，途经襄陵（今襄汾县）时，王玉林被阎匪杀害，郝鸿飞在临汾获悉后，立即返回侯马向党组织作了汇报，受到怀疑。
    １９５１年，郝鸿飞被以历史反革命罪逮捕，判处有期徒刑９年。屡次政治运动的“洗劫”使他万念俱灰。１９８５年，侯马市人民法院在复查历史冤假错案时，发现了这一案件。他们立即成立了专案组，为了澄清事实，办案人员先后奔赴西安、广州等地行程一万余公里调查取证。由于案件时间长、历史背景复杂，加上大部分知情者已经去世，给办案造成了很大困难。具有高度责任感的办案人员不放过任何细微的线索，终于查清事实，证明郝鸿飞是我党发展的敌伪人员中正式使用的情报侦察员。
    １９８８年６月，侯马市人民法院认为郝鸿飞历史反革命一案，原判事实不清，把王玉林遭残害怀疑为郝告密所致没有根据，依照《中华人民共和国刑事诉讼法》第１４９条规定，撤销原判，宣告郝鸿飞无罪，给这位老人３７年的冤案平了反。
    为了使老人愉快地度过晚年，侯马市人民法院积极和有关部门联系，有关部门拿出１５００元补助老人的生活。
