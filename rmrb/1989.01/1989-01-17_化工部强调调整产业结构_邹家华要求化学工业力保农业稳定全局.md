	Xinhua Beijing January 16th Report: Correspondent Jiang Shaogao reports: What makes money, everywhere is competing to build it, blindly introducing and repeating construction, one of the reasons is that macro-control is not effective. Therefore, when the new organization of the Chemical Industry Department started to operate, the State Council required the Chemical Industry Department to change its functions and be responsible for the management of the chemical industry. Today, Qin Zhongda, the Minister of the Chemical Industry Department, emphasized at the meeting of the Chemical Industry Department's bureau directors that in the future, the Chemical Industry Department should reduce the functions of directly managing enterprise activities, focus on macro-control, strengthen overall planning, coordination, service, and supervision, and seize the opportunity of rectification and reform to adjust the chemical industry structure.

	The Chemical Industry Department proposed four categories of chemical products to be supported: The first category is fertilizers and their supporting chemical mines, pesticides, and agricultural films and other agricultural chemical products; the second category is basic chemical raw materials related to light industry, textiles, machinery, building materials and other industries, various intermediates, organic chemical raw materials, synthetic materials and other raw material chemical products; the third category is fine chemical products that are in line with the market, including dyes, paints and electronic chemicals, biochemicals, functional high molecular materials and others; the fourth category is rubber and plastic processing products that are urgently needed in the market, including radial tires, export rubber shoes and others.

	There are also four categories of products that should be restricted: The first category is general processing products with low performance and repeated construction, such as bias-ply tires, general chemical reagents, general paints and others; the second category is products from small chemical enterprises with high energy consumption and low efficiency, such as sulfuric acid method titanium dioxide with a capacity of less than 3,500 tons, paints with a capacity of less than 5,000 tons and others; the third category is products made by crude methods that do not meet standards or pollute the environment, such as crude pesticides, crude phosphate fertilizers and others; the fourth category is products with excess production.

	State Councilor Zou Jiahua attended today's meeting. He said, at present, the chemical industry should take ensuring agriculture and stabilizing the overall situation as the primary task, and spare no effort to grasp the production of fertilizers, pesticides, and agricultural film raw materials, and use the limited funds on the key points.

　　化工部强调调整产业结构
    邹家华要求化学工业力保农业稳定全局
    本报北京１月１６日讯  记者江绍高报道：什么赚钱，各地争相上什么，盲目引进，重复建设，原因之一是宏观调控不得力。因此，化工部新的机构开始运行时，国务院就要求化工部转变职能，负责化工大行业的管理。今天，化工部部长秦仲达在化工部厅局长会上强调，今后化工部要减少直接管理企业活动的职能，致力于宏观调控，加强统筹、协调、服务、监督，抓住治理整顿的有利时机，调整化工产业结构。
    化工部提出重点支持的化工产品有四类：第一类是化肥及其配套的化学矿山、农药、农膜等支农化工产品；第二类是与轻纺、机电、建材等工业有关的基本化工原料、各种中间体、有机化工原料、合成材料等原材料化工产品；第三类是适销对路的精细化工产品，包括染料、涂料及电子用化学品、生物化学品、功能高分子材料等；第四类是市场急需的橡胶、塑料加工制品，包括子午线轮胎、出口胶鞋等。
    限制生产的产品也有四类：第一类是性能低下、重复建设的一般性加工产品，如斜交轮胎、通用化学试剂、一般性涂料等；第二类是能耗高、效益差的小型化工企业的产品，如３５００吨以下的硫酸法钛白粉、５０００吨以下小油漆等；第三类是土法上马、质量达不到标准或污染环境的产品，如土法农药、土法磷肥等；第四类是生产过剩的产品。
    国务委员邹家华参加了今天的会议。他说，当前化学工业要把保农业、稳定全局作为首要任务，全力以赴抓好化肥、农药和农膜原料的生产，把有限的资金用在刀刃上。
