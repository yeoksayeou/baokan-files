The Agricultural Bank of China has made significant strides in entering the global financial market in recent years and has now established business cooperation relationships with over 60 countries and regions.

The Agricultural Bank of China began joining international financial organizations in 1982 and established connections with the World Bank. To meet the needs of foreign exchange-earning township enterprises and export-oriented agriculture, the bank's branches in Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Foshan, Fuzhou, Xiamen, and Shanghai started offering international settlement services in 1984. Since April of last year, the bank's headquarters has been working on unifying the establishment of correspondent banking relationships with foreign banks. Recently, it officially set up an International Business Department, which handles 12 types of business, including foreign exchange deposits and loans, import and export trade settlements, overseas fund-raising, foreign exchange guarantees, and economic consulting. Its foreign exchange settlement center has also begun operations.

　　农行国际金融业务长足发展
    本报讯  新华社记者焦然、本报记者江夏报道：中国农业银行，近年来大步走向世界金融市场，目前已与６０多个国家和地区的银行建立了业务合作关系。
    农行从１９８２年起开始加入国际金融组织，并与世界银行建立联系。为适应创汇型乡镇企业和外向型农业的发展需要，农行深圳、广州、佛山、福州、厦门、上海等分行，从１９８４年起陆续开办了国际结算业务。从去年４月起农行总行着手与国外银行统一建立代理行关系，不久前，又正式组建了国际业务部，经营外汇存贷款、进出口贸易结算、境外筹资以及外汇担保、经济咨询等１２项业务，其外汇结算中心已开始运营。
