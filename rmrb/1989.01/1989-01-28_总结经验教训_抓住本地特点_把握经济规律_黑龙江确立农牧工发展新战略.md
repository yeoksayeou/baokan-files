The grain production in Heilongjiang Province, which has been stagnating at around 17.5 billion kilograms for four consecutive years, appears to be on the verge of a turning point.

This anticipated change comes from the provincial party committee and government's prescription for the province's 20 million farmers, emphasizing the fundamental position of agriculture, promoting livestock to support agriculture, using industry to supplement agriculture, and focusing on processing agricultural and livestock products in township enterprises.

This seemingly ordinary but crucial strategic arrangement for the province's 16 million mu of arable land has been recently formulated by Heilongjiang Province based on the lessons learned from many years of experience.

The provincial leadership has identified some mistakes from the recent stagnation in agricultural development. For instance, the handling of the relationship between "no agriculture, no stability," "no industry, no prosperity," and "no commerce, no vitality" has sometimes been in the wrong order. Agricultural investment has relatively decreased, farmers' burdens have increased year after year, and there have been insufficient measures to stabilize and develop agriculture. In contrast, more "hard targets" have been set for the development of township enterprises. However, due to the weakness of agriculture and limited farmers' income, township enterprises have been unable to open up a broad market, and their development lags behind the national average.

Experience and lessons have shown that for Heilongjiang Province's rural economy to achieve significant development, it is crucial to grasp the local characteristics and make development decisions that comply with economic laws. Recently, the reporter discovered from the provincial government's "Ten Measures to Accelerate Agricultural Development," the provincial party secretary's speech, relevant investigation reports, and deployment that Heilongjiang is now grasping the pulse of the province's rural economy.

	— The province has a large amount of arable land and pasture, a high degree of mechanization, and extensive experience in increasing yields on a large scale. The potential for developing agriculture and livestock is considerable. Some estimate that even if only agriculture and livestock are developed, it can make the income of Heilongjiang farmers reach the average level of the suburbs of Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai.

	— Heilongjiang has a developed heavy industry but a weak light industry. The current township enterprises have few flagship products. However, the potential for agriculture and livestock is considerable, which can increase the accumulation for township enterprises and become a reliable raw material base for the development of light industrial products by township enterprises. In this regard, it is something that many provinces along the southeast coast cannot match. Therefore, it is in line with local realities to establish the direction of township enterprises focusing on processing agricultural and livestock products.

	— Heilongjiang's livestock industry has a sufficient feed supply and considerable development potential. However, due to insufficient investment, the development of large tracts of farmland in Heilongjiang has encountered difficulties. Therefore, it is an objective need to determine that livestock and agriculture develop in parallel, with livestock supporting agriculture.

Heilongjiang, which is far from the port and located on the border, is exploring a new plan for the coordinated development of agriculture, livestock, and industry that suits the province's characteristics. This marks that the rural economy here is about to embark on a new track.

### 总结经验教训　抓住本地特点　把握经济规律  黑龙江确立农牧工发展新战略

　　总结经验教训　抓住本地特点　把握经济规律    
    黑龙江确立农牧工发展新战略
    本报讯  记者武培真报道：粮食生产连续４年徘徊在１７５亿公斤的黑龙江省，看来要改变踏步不前的局面了。
    这一可预见到的转机，来自省委省政府为两千多万农民开了一个突出农业基础地位、以牧养农、以工补农和乡镇企业以加工农牧产品为基本任务的药方。
    这个看来普通、却对１．６亿亩耕地有着至关重要影响的战略安排，是黑龙江省吸取多年经验教训新近制定的。
    黑龙江省领导班子，从近几年来农业徘徊不前的困境中总结出某些失误点。譬如，处理“无农不稳”、“无工不富”、“无商不活”三者关系，曾一度出现顺序倒置的现象。农业投资相对下降，农民负担连年上升，稳定和发展农业缺乏过硬措施，相比之下，在发展乡镇企业上却下了不少“硬指标”，而乡镇企业又因农业薄弱，农民收入有限，而无法开辟广阔市场，其发展落后于全国平均水平。
    经验和教训证明黑龙江省的农村经济要有一个大的发展，首先要把握住本地特点，因地制宜地确立符合经济规律的发展决策。记者近日从省政府的《加快农业发展的十条措施》、省委书记的讲话、有关调查报告和部署中发现，黑龙江正在把握本省农村经济的脉搏。
    ——该省耕地和草场较多、机械化程度高，又有大面积提高单产的试点经验，发展农牧业的潜力较大。有人估算，即使单一搞好农牧业，也可使黑龙江农民的收入达到京、津、沪郊区的平均水平。
    ——黑龙江重工业发达而轻工业薄弱，现有乡镇企业中的拳头产品更少。而潜力较大的农牧业既可为乡镇企业增加积累，又可成为乡镇企业发展轻工产品的可靠原料基地。就这一点来说，是东南沿海许多省份所不及的。所以，确立乡镇企业以加工农牧产品为主向是符合本地实际的。
    ——黑龙江畜牧业，因饲料来源充足，发展潜力较大。而黑龙江大片农田因资金投入不足，发展陷入困境。因此，确定畜牧业和农业平行发展、以牧养农是客观需要。
    远离港口、地处边陲的黑龙江，正在探寻的这一符合本省特点的农牧工三位一体协调发展的新方案，标志着这里的农村经济将要走上新轨道。
