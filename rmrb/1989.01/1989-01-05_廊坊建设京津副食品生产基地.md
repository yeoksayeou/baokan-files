Langfang Builds Subsidiary Food Production Base for Beijing and Tianjin

According to Xinhua News Agency in Shijiazhuang, the Langfang region of Hebei Province is actively building a subsidiary food production base to directly serve the two major cities of Beijing and Tianjin. In 1988, the total value of vegetables, fruits, meat, poultry, eggs, milk, and fish supplied to the Beijing and Tianjin markets reached 160 million yuan.

The counties under the jurisdiction of the Langfang region all border Beijing and Tianjin. To better serve these two cities, in recent years, the counties have established 1,153 orchards of over 100 mu each, 443 vegetable specialty villages, 367 melon specialty villages, and over 5,100 large-scale breeding households. These bases and specialty households take the market demand of Beijing and Tianjin as their production direction. Many of them have established direct supply relationships with urban areas, providing various subsidiary foods to the cities in a point-to-point, directional, timely, and quantitative manner.

    据新华社石家庄电  河北省廊坊地区积极建设直接为京、津两大城市服务的副食品生产基地，一九八八年向京、津两大市场提供的瓜、果、菜、肉、禽、蛋、奶、鱼的总值达一点六亿元。
    廊坊地区所属各县都与京、津两市接壤。为更好地为京、津两市服务，近年来，各县共建成百亩以上果园一千一百五十三个，蔬菜专业村四百四十三个，瓜类专业村三百六十七个，出现养殖大户五千一百多个。这些基地和专业户以京津市场需求为生产方向，其中许多与城市方面建立了直接对口供货关系，定点、定向、定时、定量地为城市生产各种副食品。
