A 28-year-old female worker, Jin, suffered from mastitis, experiencing severe pain and high fever. After being treated three times by Dr. Yang Yongshu from the Health Department of the Henan International Trust and Investment Corporation using her self-invented "cyclic massage and relaxation therapy," Jin recovered without taking any medication or injections. Yang has used this method to relieve or reduce the pain of tens of thousands of patients. After thorough and careful evaluation, 13 medical experts from Henan Province concluded that the cyclic massage and relaxation therapy is a new method for treating diseases.

Yang originally studied Western medicine. Over the past 20 years, she has diligently studied traditional Chinese medical theories on meridians and viscera, as well as modern medical theories on anatomy, pathology, and physiology. Through long-term practice, she developed this innovative treatment method that does not require medication or injections. The reporter observed that when treating patients, Yang uses her hands to touch the soft tissues on the patient's body surface, identifying certain pathological features such as adhesions, nodules, cords, edema, and qi sensations. She then employs various techniques, guiding along the meridians and directing the flow, to achieve the goals of relaxing tissues, unblocking meridians, nourishing qi and blood, balancing yin and yang, and restoring organ functions. Each treatment session lasts only 1 to 3 minutes. This method can also be used for health maintenance and disease prevention.

　　三次推拿便治好乳腺炎
    杨永淑发明循经推运松解疗法
    据新华社郑州１月９日电  （记者陈朝中）２８岁的女工晋某患乳腺炎，疼痛难忍，高烧不止。经河南省国际信托投资公司卫生所医师杨永淑用自己发明的循经推运松解疗法治疗３次后，没有吃药打针就痊愈了。杨永淑用这种方法已为数以万计的病人解除或减轻了痛苦。河南省的１３名医学专家经过细致认真的鉴定后，认为循经推运松解疗法是一种治疗疾病的新方法。
    杨永淑原来学习西医，近２０年来，她认真钻研祖国传统医学经络、脏象原理和现代医学的解剖、病理学、生理学有关理论，在长期实践中建立起这种不用吃药打针的新颖治疗方法。记者看到，她给人治病时，用手在患者体表软组织处触摸，根据某些病变特征，如粘连、硬结、条索、水肿、气感等，采取多种不同手法，循经引导，定向推运，达到松解组织、疏通经络、滋补气血，调整阴阳，恢复脏腑功能的目的。治一次病只用１到３分钟，用这种方法还能健身防病。
