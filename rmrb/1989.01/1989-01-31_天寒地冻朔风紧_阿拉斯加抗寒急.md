	Far from the mainland of the United States, the state of Alaska entered its third week of severe cold today under a state of emergency, with many towns facing shortages of food and fuel.

	On January 23, 1971, Alaska recorded the lowest temperature in the United States at minus 27 degrees Celsius. However, during this cold snap, temperatures have repeatedly dropped to minus 32 degrees Celsius. Residents of the state are suffering greatly from the cold, with at least 28 towns facing issues such as shortages of food and fuel, power outages, frozen water pipes, and heating oil turning into a thick, sticky substance.

	Governor Steve Cowper stated yesterday that this cold snap "seriously threatens the lives and property of local residents." He has ordered relevant departments to be on duty 24 hours a day to ensure that the affected towns have sufficient food and fuel. Due to the extreme cold, small aircraft that usually transport goods to these towns can no longer take off or land, so the U.S. National Guard is prepared to dispatch C-130 large military transport planes to airdrop supplies to the affected residents if necessary.

	Due to the disruption caused by this cold snap, a biennial Arctic training exercise by the U.S. military has been postponed. The 26,000 troops participating in the exercise have been ordered to stay in their barracks and not go out to ensure their safety.

	Although the narrow peninsula in the southeastern part of the state was not affected by this severe cold, it experienced heavy snowfall, with some areas recording a historic snowfall of 2,845 millimeters.

### 天寒地冻朔风紧  阿拉斯加抗寒急

　　天寒地冻朔风紧  阿拉斯加抗寒急
    新华社华盛顿１月２９日电  远离美国本土的阿拉斯加州今天在紧急状态中进入了第三个严寒之周，许多村镇处于食品燃料短缺的困境之中。
    １９７１年１月２３日阿拉斯加的气温曾创下摄氏零下２７度的全美纪录。然而在此次寒流中气温早已数次降到摄氏零下３２度。该州居民倍受寒流侵袭之苦，至少有２８个村镇正面临食品燃料短缺、电力中断、水管冻裂、供暖燃油冻成粘稠胶状等一系列问题。
    该州州长考珀昨天说，这次寒流“严重威胁着当地居民的生命财产”。他已下令有关部门２４小时值班，以确保遭受寒流侵袭的村镇有足够的食品和燃料。由于天寒地冻，平时向这些村镇运送物品的小型飞机已无法在当地起降，因此，美国国民警卫队已作好准备，一旦需要便出动Ｃ—１３０大型军用运输机向当地受困居民空投物品。
    由于这次寒流的干扰，美军两年一次的极地训练演习被迫推迟。
    参加演习的２．６万名三军官兵受命呆在军营内不得外出，以保证人身安全。
    该州东南部狭长的半岛地带虽未遭这次严寒的侵袭，但却普降大雪，一些地方的降雪量已达创记录的２８４５毫米。
