Feng County Invests 50 Million Yuan in Water Conservancy Projects Over Three Years

People's Daily reports that the people's government of Feng County, Jiangsu Province, has saved on expenditures to invest in water conservancy construction. Over the past three years, a total of 53.3 million yuan has been invested, 23 rivers have been dug and dredged, and the irrigated area of arable land in the county has increased from over 400,000 mu in 1985 to 800,000 mu this year.

Feng County is located along the old course of the Yellow River in northern Jiangsu, where the rivers are often dry. To increase agricultural water conservancy investment as much as possible, the county committee does not compete with others, adhering to the principle of not building office buildings or high-standard houses for 19 years. To this day, they still work in old flat-roofed buildings from the 1960s and a simple small building. The county also insists on reducing the scale of non-productive investments, adhering to the principle of combining state support funds, local financial contributions, and appropriate crowd-funding, gradually increasing water conservancy construction investment. In 1988 alone, 30 million yuan was invested. After three years of effort, the county has completed 13 million cubic meters of earth and stone work.

　　丰县３年投资５０００万修水利
    本报讯  江苏省丰县人民政府节省开支用于水利建设，３年来共投资５３３０万元，开挖、疏浚２３条河流，使全县耕地浇灌面积由１９８５年的４０多万亩上升到今年的８０万亩。
    丰县地处苏北黄河故道沿岸，河道常年干涸。为了尽量增加农业水利投资，县委不与别人攀比，坚持１９年不盖办公楼和高标准平房，至今都挤在６０年代建造的旧平房和一幢简易小楼里办公。县里还坚持压缩非生产性投资规模，本着上级扶持资金不挪用、地方财政尽力拿、群众适当集资三结合的原则，使水利建设投资逐年增加。仅１９８８年就投入资金３０００万元。经过３年努力，全县完成土石方１３００万立方米。
