	Relying on the Masses and Investigating to the End
	Hunan Dares to Tackle Bribery and Embezzlement Cases

	Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, January 22nd. Correspondent Wu Xinghua reports: Hunan province's various levels of procuratorial organs have concentrated their efforts on investigating serious cases of bribery and embezzlement, effectively maintaining the socialist economic order and promoting the clean governance of party and government organs. Statistics show that last year, the province's various levels of procuratorial organs handled 2,356 economic crime cases, of which 1,401 were cases of bribery and embezzlement, accounting for 60%. Among these, 383 cases involved amounts over 100,000 yuan; 16 cases involved amounts between 500,000 and 1 million yuan; 24 cases involved amounts between 1 million and 5 million yuan; 2 cases involved amounts between 5 million and 10 million yuan; and 5 cases involved amounts over 10 million yuan.

	Hunan's various levels of procuratorial organs rely heavily on the masses in their investigations. They have established reporting centers and appointed procuratorial liaison officers to capture and collect leads on serious economic crimes such as bribery and embezzlement. By the end of last year, the province had established 127 mass reporting institutions and appointed 4,693 procuratorial liaison officers, uncovering 4,926 cases, of which 3,091 were within the procuratorial system, involving 5,185 individuals, including 122 at the county level or above. Various levels of procuratorial organs have organized investigations into 1,250 cases, filed charges in 346 cases, arrested 78 people, and decided to prosecute 72 cases, of which 9 have been adjudicated by the courts, recovering economic losses totaling 7.02 million yuan. The Lengshuijiang Municipal People's Procuratorate's reporting center acted promptly on mass reports, filing 8 cases in three months, cracking 5 major bribery and embezzlement cases involving over 100,000 yuan, and recovering 320,000 yuan in illicit gains.

	In investigating serious economic crimes such as bribery and embezzlement, Hunan's various levels of procuratorial organs dare to confront difficulties, fear no powers, resist the "intervention wind," and handle cases according to law, investigating to the end. After the masses reported serious economic problems involving Yongzhou Municipal Construction Office Party Committee Secretary Yin Zhiyu, some people called the municipal procuratorate to warn that Yin had powerful backers and to be careful; some leaders vouched for Yin, saying there were no problems. The municipal procuratorate overcame interference and filed a case in November last year, ultimately uncovering that Yin, while serving as deputy party secretary of Chaoyang Township, had embezzled 50,000 yuan in construction funds, and had Yin lawfully arrested. The masses applauded.

　　依靠群众　一查到底
    湖南查处受贿贪污案敢于碰硬
    本报长沙１月２２日电  记者吴兴华报道：湖南省各级检察机关集中力量，查处严重的受贿、贪污等案件，有力地维护了社会主义经济秩序和促进了党政机关的廉政建设。据统计，去年全省各级检察院立案的２３５６件经济犯罪案件中，受贿、贪污两类案件１４０１件，占６０％，其中万元以上的３８３件；５万到１０万元的１６件；１０万到５０万元的２４件；５０万到１００万元的２件；１００万元以上的５件。
    湖南各级检察机关查处案件紧紧依靠群众，他们通过设立举报中心、聘任检察联络员等措施，捕捉、搜集受贿、贪污等严重经济犯罪线索。到去年底，全省已设立了群众举报机构１２７个；已聘任检察联络员４６９３名，已查出案件线索４９２６个。其中属于检察机关系统的３０９１件，被举报的对象５１８５名，其中县处级以上干部１２２名。各级检察机关已组织力量初查了１２５０件，立案侦查了３４６件，依法逮捕７８人，决定起诉７２件，其中已经法院判决的９件，已挽回经济损失７０２万元。冷水江市人民检察院举报中心根据群众的举报及时查处，３个月立案８件，破获了万元以上的受贿、贪污大案５件，追回赃款３２万元。
    湖南各级检察机关在查处受贿、贪污等严重经济犯罪案件中，敢于碰硬，不畏权势，抵制“说情风”，依法办案，一查到底。群众举报永州市城建办党委书记尹之屿的严重经济问题后，有的人给市检察院打招呼，说尹的后台硬，要当心；有的领导则为尹打包票，说没有问题。市检察院排除干扰，于去年１１月立案，终于查明尹原在朝阳乡任党委副书记期间，利用职权，贪污工程款５万余元，将尹依法逮捕，群众拍手称快。
