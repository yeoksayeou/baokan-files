Purchasing stocks is a form of investment, and stockholders can obtain returns from it. How is this return realized? Many people are still unclear about this. Here, we invite a colleague from the People's Bank of China to explain.

    Dividends and bonuses are the two forms of investment returns for stockholders. Preferred stockholders receive dividends as their investment returns; common stockholders receive bonuses as their investment returns.

    Dividends are distributed based on the nominal capital amount invested by the investor. Dividends generally have a fixed rate and are paid out periodically. They do not fluctuate with the presence or amount of the company's profits. After paying out preferred stock dividends, the remaining profits distributed by the joint-stock company are what is commonly referred to as dividends. The amount received from dividends is determined by the board of directors based on the opinions of the shareholders' meeting. The rate is entirely dependent on whether the joint-stock company has profits and the amount of those profits. If there are no profits in a given year, there will be no dividends.

    Dividends and bonuses are collectively referred to as stock dividends. Stock dividends typically come in three forms. (1) Cash dividends. This is the most common form of stock dividend, where the joint-stock company pays dividends to its shareholders in cash. (2) Stock dividends. Issuing new shares as dividends is a method for joint-stock companies to increase capital. Stock dividends are paid out based on a certain proportion of the shares held by shareholders. If a company announces a 5% stock dividend, then a shareholder holding 100 shares will receive an additional 5 shares. (3) Property dividends. This refers to the distribution of dividends in the form of the company's assets. Usually, the company distributes this type of dividend using its products or various securities it holds.

    The level of stock returns is represented by the yield rate, the formula for which is:

    	Annual Expected Dividends per Share
    Yield Rate = ───────────────── × 100%
    	Market Price per Share

    For example, if a stock is currently issued with a market price of 50 yuan per share and the expected annual dividends can reach 5 yuan per share, then the yield rate of this stock is:

    	5
    Yield Rate = ──── × 100% = 10%
    	50

    The level of stock returns is mainly influenced by the operating level of the joint-stock company and its dividend distribution policy.

　　股票的收益
    购买股票是一种投资手段，股票持有者可以从中获得收益。这种收益是通过什么方式实现的呢？很多人还不清楚。在此请中国人民银行的同志介绍一下。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　——编者
    股息和红利是股票持有人取得投资收益的两种形式。优先股票持有人以股息作为投资的报酬；普通股票持有人以取得红利作为投资的收益。
    股息是按投资人入股的票面资本额为分配标准的，股息一般有确定的比率，定期发放。它不以公司利润的有无或多少而变动。优先股股息支付之后，股份公司对剩余利润的分配，就是通常所说的分红，分红的所得即红利。红利是根据股东大会的意见，由董事会确定其分配比率。比率的高低完全依股份公司利润有无和多少而定，如当年无利润，则无分红。
    股息和红利通称为股利。股利通常有三种形式。（一）现金股利。它是最普通的一种股利，由股份公司以现金形式向其股东支付。（二）股票股利。用新增股票发放股利是股份公司进行增资的一种手段。股票股利是按股东所持股份的一定比例支付的，如果一个公司宣布５％的股票股利，那么持有１００股的股东将得到新增加的５股。（三）财产股利。即以股份公司的资产发放股利。通常公司以其产品或所持有的各种有价证券派发这种股利。
    股票的收益水平用收益率表示，其公式为：
    　　　　　每股年预期股利
    收益率＝─────────×１００％
    　　　　每股股票的市场价格
    例如，现在发行一种股票，每股的市场价格为５０元，预期年股利可达到每股５元，那么这种股票的收益率为：
    　　　　　５
    收益率＝────×１００％＝１０％
    　　　　　５０
    股票收益的高低主要受股份公司的经营水平以及股利分配政策的影响。
