Indian troops begin withdrawal from Sri Lanka at President Premadasa's request

	NEW DELHI, Jan. 1 (Xinhua) -- In light of the successful conduct of the provincial council elections and the presidential election in Sri Lanka, Indian troops stationed in Sri Lanka have started withdrawing in batches from the eastern and northern provinces since late November last year.

	This was announced in a news release issued today by the Indian High Commission in Sri Lanka.

	Indian High Commissioner Dixit, in response to a reporter's question, said that India announced the withdrawal of part of its troops in Sri Lanka at the request of Sri Lankan President-elect Premadasa before he takes office on January 2. However, he refused to disclose the specific number of troops being withdrawn, only stating that the current number of Indian troops in Sri Lanka is approximately 45,000 to 50,000.

	Dixit said that Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and Sri Lankan President Jayewardene discussed the issue of Indian troop withdrawal during the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation summit held in Pakistan last week.

	The Indian troops entered Sri Lanka under the Indo-Sri Lankan Peace Accord signed on July 29, 1987, with the mission to help end the ethnic conflict in the country.

　　应普雷马达萨总统要求
    印军开始分批撤出斯里兰卡
    新华社科伦坡１月１日电  鉴于斯里兰卡省议会选举和总统大选的顺利进行，印度驻斯里兰卡的部队已从去年１１月底开始分批从东部和北部省份撤出。
    这是印度驻斯里兰卡高级专员署在今天发表的一项新闻公报中宣布的。
    印度高级专员迪克西特在回答记者问时说，印度是应斯里兰卡当选总统普雷马达萨的要求，在他１月２日就任总统前宣布撤出部分印军的消息的。但是，他拒绝透露撤出部队的具体数字，他只是说，目前留在斯里兰卡的印军大约是４．５万至５万人。
    迪克西特说，印度总理拉·甘地与斯里兰卡总统贾亚瓦德纳上周在巴基斯坦举行的南亚区域合作联盟首脑会议上讨论了印度撤军的问题。
    印度军队是根据１９８７年７月２９日达成的印斯和平协议进驻斯里兰卡的，其使命是帮助结束当地的种族冲突。
