The Chaoyang District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Beijing has maintained strict management and flexible operations without chaos. In 1988, it achieved a profit of 12 million yuan, a 70% increase over the previous year, making it the first district-level cooperative in the city to surpass 10 million yuan in profit.

To ensure that enterprises operate within a good economic order, the cooperative has implemented a strict evaluation system for its base-level enterprises. This system includes quality service, store hygiene, price management, commodity supply, and fund turnover, all of which are part of the responsibility system. Inspections and evaluations are based on these criteria. Each store has developed a commodity operation catalog, actively organizing the supply of daily necessities such as food, clothing, daily use items, and fuel for local residents. In 1988, the nine base-level cooperatives in the district saw a 39% increase in business volume compared to the previous year, and effectively prevented problematic commodities from entering the inventory. In September 1988, two stores purchased a batch of low-efficiency pesticides from outside the district. Upon inspection by relevant departments, the store management immediately decided to stop sales and required the return of already sold products. Compared to 1986, the fund turnover of Chaoyang District Supply and Marketing Cooperative has been accelerated by 20 days, the efficiency of truck transportation has doubled, and labor productivity per person has increased by 77%. These three improvements together bring an additional income of over 5 million yuan to the enterprise annually.

　　管理严格不懈怠　经营灵活不混乱
    朝阳区供销社年创利１２００万元
    本报讯  记者赵兴林报道：北京市朝阳区供销社坚持对基层企业严格考核，经营活而不乱，１９８８年实现利润１２００万元，比上年增长７０％，成为全市第一个超１０００万元的区县供销社。
    为了确保企业经营能在良好的经济秩序中运转，防止盲目追求大购大销，违反供应政策，这个区供销社把优质服务、店堂卫生、物价管理、商品供应和资金周转等，都纳入岗位责任制。检查评比以此为依据。每个门店都制订出商品经营目录，积极组织当地群众生活所需的吃、穿、用、烧商品。全区９个基层供销社，１９８８年营业额比上年上升了３９％，并基本上杜绝了有问题商品入库。１９８８年９月有两家商店从外埠购进一批农药，经有关部门检查属低效农药，商店领导当即决定停止销售，并要求对已售出的如数追回。与１９８６年相比：朝阳区供销社的资金周转加快了２０天，汽车运载效率增长了一倍，人均劳效上升了７７％，这三项加在一起，一年就可为企业增收５００多万元。
