Henan Moves Towards Becoming a Plain Green Province

The total volume of timber in the province has increased by 1.5 times in eight years

    The People's Daily reports: Henan Province, which has seen rapid development in plain greening, is now accelerating its efforts to become the first plain green province in the country. The provincial government recently proposed that by 1991, all plain and semi-plain counties in the province should reach the plain greening standard. Those that have not yet reached the standard should be greened within a limited time, and those that have reached the standard should improve their level and move to a new stage.

    Henan Province started its plain greening relatively early. At present, the province has built 30 million mu of agricultural poplar interplanting, 28 million mu of farmland forest networks, and 210,000 villages and 100,000 kilometers of rivers and roads have been covered by greenery, forming a new pattern of plain forestry. The total volume of timber in the province has increased from 29 million cubic meters in 1980 to 445.77 million cubic meters, an increase of 1.5 times. In 1985, two regions and 40 counties in the province reached the plain greening standard issued by the State Forestry Administration. Last year, 17 more counties reached the standard.

    Not long ago, Song Zhaosu, Vice Governor of Henan Province, inspected some counties and found that the development in various places was uneven. Some places remained the same for several years, with little change in appearance. Some counties that had already reached the standard had low greening levels. There are still 37 counties (cities) in the province where the greening speed is slow, and there are "gaps" and "breaks" in the trees.

    In response to these situations, the provincial government convened relevant departments to study and formulate new measures to accelerate the greening process: First, it is required that all levels of leading cadres further improve their awareness and regard plain greening as a biological engineering project of agricultural basic construction. Second, the dual responsibility system is promoted, with each level of government responsible for the task and the forestry department responsible for the technology. Third, unified planning is implemented, with trees planted according to the land, seedlings raised by themselves, and benefits enjoyed by those who plant the trees. Fourth, the target responsibility system is implemented, and the greening tasks for the 37 counties that have not yet reached the standard are clearly defined. Those who fail to complete the tasks will be held accountable. Fifth, strengthen management and establish and improve township-level forestry work stations and other management institutions.

　　河南向平原绿化省迈进    
    全省林木蓄积量八年增长一点五倍
    本报讯  平原绿化发展较快的河南省，目前正快马加鞭，向全国第一个平原绿化省迈进。省政府最近提出，到１９９１年，全省所有的平原、半平原县都要达到平原绿化标准，尚未达标的要限期绿化，已达标的要提高水平，再上一个新台阶。
    河南省平原绿化起步较早。目前，全省已建成３０００万亩农桐间作，２８００万亩农田林网，有２１万个村庄、１０万公里河渠道路已被绿色覆盖，形成平原林业新格局。全省林木蓄积量由１９８０年的２９００万立方米，上升到４４５７．７万立方米，增长１．５倍。１９８５年，全省有两个地区、４０个县达到林业部颁布的平原绿化标准。去年又涌现了１７个达标县。
    不久前，河南省副省长宋照肃在视察一些地县的平原绿化时，发现各地发展还不平衡，有的地方几年山河依旧，面貌改变不大。有些已经达标的县，绿化水平还不高。全省还有３７个县（市）至今绿化速度缓慢，树木“断挡”“断带”。
    针对这些情况，省政府召集有关部门研究制定了加快绿化进程的新措施：一是要求各级领导干部进一步提高认识，把平原绿化当做农业基本建设的一项生物工程建设来抓。二是推行双包责任制，各级政府包任务，林业部门包技术。三是统一规划，树随地走，苗木自筹，谁栽树谁受益。四是实行目标管理责任制，对３７个未达标的县明确绿化任务，完不成的追究责任。五是加强管护，建立、完善乡级林业工作站等管理机构。
