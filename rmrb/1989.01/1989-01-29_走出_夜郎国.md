	Stepping Out of the "Night Kingdom"
	By Zhu Weiqun, People's Daily Reporter

	The *Records of the Grand Historian* states: "Night Kingdom is near the Taojiang River, the river is over a hundred paces wide, and it can accommodate boats." According to the *Annals of Anshun Prefecture*, the name "Night Kingdom" originates from the ancient Night Mountain and Lang Mountain, which are the watershed of the Beipan River (ancient Taojiang River) and the Napan River. This area is precisely where the Buyi people reside in Guizhou Province today. The county committee secretary of Guanling Buyi and Miao Autonomous County, Ma Qizhong, is a Buyi person and also a member of the Guizhou Buyi Studies Association. He told me: The ancestors of the Buyi people were undoubtedly one of the main ethnic groups of the ancient Night Kingdom.

	"The phrase 'Are we greater than the Han?' has linked 'Night Kingdom' with 'arrogance' for over two thousand years. In reality, the arrogance of the Night Kingdom was a result of the isolation between the southwest and the central plains at that time." The Buyi studies researcher at the Guizhou Provincial Institute of Nationalities, Wu Wenyi, told me: "The Buyi people have never rejected external cultures and have always admired and learned from Han culture. During the Ming Dynasty, many Buyi people studied Han characters and used them to phonetically transcribe their own religious scriptures." The Buyi people have made historical contributions to the development of the vast southwest of China over a long period and have formed their own unique agricultural civilization. The Buyi people have cultivated dozens of varieties of rice, recognize over a hundred types of river fish, and have a history of several hundred to a thousand years of cultivating sugarcane and tung trees...

	In Zhenning Buyi and Miao Autonomous County, I visited the famous "China's Six Horses Tung Oil" production area – the Six Horses District. Driving into the Six Horses area, the mountains and hills are filled with tung trees. This reminds one of the inscription by Premier Zhou for the local people: "Silver flowers and golden fruits abound, tung oil crowns all of Guizhou." Due to the unique geological and climatic conditions, Six Horses tung oil has a transparent color, low acid value, low moisture content, strong fragrance, and high viscosity. Interestingly, the small tung seeds have, over several decades of development, risen and fallen in tandem with the entire country's economy. Deputy District Head Zhang Wenli told me: "Before liberation, the highest annual production of tung seeds in the district was 940,000 kilograms. After liberation, by 1958, it surged to 1,790,000 kilograms. However, from the 'Great Leap Forward' to the three years of difficulty, it plummeted to 450,000 kilograms. During the ten years of turmoil, it hovered around 1,400,000 kilograms. After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the state exempted the district from public grain taxes, and the policy of 'who plants, who owns' was implemented. The area of tung trees increased from over 50,000 mu to 150,000 mu, and in normal years, nearly 5,000,000 kilograms of tung seeds are produced. The value of tung seeds, tung oil, and tung cake is 660,000 yuan." Six Horses tung oil has taken big strides from the deep mountains to the international market and is listed as a duty-free import commodity in some countries. In the past, the Buyi people used cattle to trample, feet to tread, and wooden sticks to pound to extract oil, with very low processing capacity, and most of the tung seeds had to be transported out. Now, the district has 5 processing plants. Although the equipment is simple, it can process over 60% of the local tung seeds, and a considerable processing fee remains in the hands of the local people.

	The Buyi people are good at raising cattle and pigs. In the past, due to the closed self-sufficient economy, "cattle are raised for plowing, pigs are raised for the New Year, and chickens are raised to exchange for salt money," and very few were sold as commodities in the market. Under the impact of the commodity economy, this concept is also changing. Farmers in the Six Horses District universally raise cattle and pigs, with the district's large livestock developing to 25,000 head, and the most a household raises 15 or 16 head. The sales volume has increased. The Huajiang cattle market in Guanling Autonomous County has become one of the eight largest cattle markets in the country, with about 2,000 cattle and horses being traded at each market session.

	Many Buyi women are artists who master the arts of wax printing, brocade weaving, embroidery, and weaving. In the past, if a girl did not excel in one of these arts, she would be looked down upon by the women in the village, so girls started learning these skills at the age of ten. The influx of "foreign cloth" brought new choices for people's clothing. However, the traditional aesthetic concepts and the diligent, thrifty nature of women have made many of them maintain the habit of weaving, dyeing, and wearing their own clothes. In recent years, the light industry sector has launched a trend of seeking new sources of life in national traditional arts. Buyi art is like a buried pearl, and just a glimpse of its luster has caused amazement. In Shitou Village, Anshun County, 218 Buyi households have 1/3 who often sell their wax printing and brocade products to tourists, artists, and entrepreneurs. Each batch of foreign tourists coming to this "wax printing hometown" will happily spend thousands of yuan. The wax printing and brocade factories in the county also often come here to purchase Buyi patterns. The Anshun Buyi Carpet Factory, with its "Buyi-style" pattern style, stands out in the carpet industry, with all products exported, earning 600,000 US dollars annually.

	If, in the historical transition of our country from closure to openness, the vast southwest faces more difficulties than the coastal areas, then in the vast southwest, the Buyi and other ethnic minorities bear a heavier historical burden than the Han people. This is a universal fact.

	The Buyi people in Dingyun Township, Guanling Autonomous County, took the lead in breaking free from the "leftist" constraints in 1979 and implemented the household responsibility system. However, in the second step of rural reform, the local people seem to lack the means to engage in commodity economy, and most still rely on farming eight mu of land for a living. Although production has developed compared to the past, the per capita output is still around 200 yuan, and the grain output per person hovers around 100-200 kilograms. About 30% of the households have not yet solved the problem of food and clothing.

	The comrades in the Six Horses District told me: "If we compare ourselves vertically, we have made significant progress in the past ten years; but if we compare horizontally with the rest of the country, the changes are not obvious, and the gap is even widening." The district's cadres pay great attention to studying commodity economy issues, but they face a difficulty that they cannot overcome in the short term with their own strength, which is the inconvenient transportation in the mountainous area and the difficulty in communicating information. Out of the district's 10 townships, 2 have roads, 5 have roads in good weather but are blocked in rainy weather, and 3 townships do not have roads at all. Only 9.8% of the natural villages in the district have roads. During the tung seed harvesting season, hundreds of millions of kilograms of tung seeds are transported out by people carrying and horses loading. Some farmers sell pigs in the district, and after hiring people to carry the pigs out of the mountains, the money from selling the pigs is only enough for labor and meal costs, and what they bring back home are just two pig-carrying poles. The mountains' isolation means that less than 10% of the district's large livestock can be marketed, and less than 5% of the homemade cloth can be marketed, with a large amount of agricultural and sideline products rotting in the mountains. Many Buyi people do not speak Mandarin, which limits their courage to go out and enter the market. To this day, some villages cannot find a single person who can read newspapers, and the district has only one public primary school for every 23.8 square kilometers, with an actual enrollment rate of less than 50%. The district has an excess of teachers, but here, public school teachers are still short of 20. Some normal school graduates, after being assigned here, do not even wait for a year to be formally appointed before leaving without saying goodbye.

	Stepping out of the "Night Kingdom" is not something that can be achieved overnight; it requires the courage and perseverance of several generations. Stepping out of the "Night Kingdom" is not just the Buyi people's own affair; it requires the whole society to lend a helping hand.

### 走出“夜郎国”

　　走出“夜郎国”
    本报记者  朱维群
    《史记》载：“夜郎者，临牂牁江，江广百余步，足以行船”。据《安顺府志》载：夜郎之名源于古之夜山和郎山，也就是北盘江（即古牂牁江）和南盘江的分水岭。而这一带正是今天贵州省布依族集居之地。关岭布依族苗族自治县县委书记马启忠是布依族人，又是省布依学会成员。他对我说：布依族先民，无疑是古夜郎国主体民族之一。
    “吾与汉孰大？”这一句话，把“夜郎”与“自大”连在一起两千余年。其实夜郎自大是当时西南与中原的隔绝状态造成的。省民族研究所布依族研究人员伍文义告诉我：“布依族从不拒绝外来文化，对汉文化是钦慕和学习的。明代许多布依族人就习汉文并用汉字作为拼音记录本民族的宗教典籍。”布依族在长期发展中对开发祖国大西南作出了历史贡献，并形成了自己独具特色的农业文明。布依族培育的水稻有几十个品种，对河鱼有上百种识别，种植甘蔗、油桐树有几百、上千年历史……
    在镇宁布依族苗族自治县，我采访了著名的“中国六马桐油”的产地——六马区。车入六马地界，满山满岭都是油桐树。这不禁使人想起当年周总理为这里人民的题词：“银花金果丰，油桐冠全黔”。由于特有的地质、气候条件，六马桐油色泽透明，酸价低，水份少，香味浓，粘性强。有趣的是，小小油桐籽，几十年发展竟与我们整个国家经济起落“同步”。张文礼副区长告诉我：“解放前全区油桐籽最高年产９４万公斤，解放后到１９５８年猛增到１７９万公斤，然而从‘大跃进’到三年困难，惨跌到４５万公斤。十年动乱中一直在１４０万公斤徘徊。十一届三中全会以后，国家减免全区公粮，政策上提出谁种谁有，油桐面积从５万多亩增加到１５万亩，正常年景产桐籽近５００万公斤，桐籽、桐油和桐饼产值有６６０万元。”六马桐油大踏步从深山走向国际市场，在一些国家被列为进口免检商品。以往布依族榨油用牛碾、用脚踩、用木棒舂，加工能力极低，大部分桐籽要外运。现在全区有５个加工厂，虽然设备简陋，但已能加工本地桐籽６０％以上，一笔可观的加工费得以留在本地群众手里。
    布依族善养牛、养猪。过去囿于封闭的自给自足经济，“养牛为耕田，养猪为过年，养鸡为换盐巴钱”，很少有作为商品进入市场的。在商品经济冲击下，这种观念也在改变。六马区农民普遍养牛养猪，全区大牲畜发展到２．５万头，最多一户养牛十五六头，出售量提高。关岭自治县的花江牛市，成为全国八大牛市之一，每个场期上市牛马约２０００多头。
    布依族妇女，很多是集蜡染、织锦、刺绣、织布诸艺于一身的艺术家。过去姑娘家若有一艺不精，就会被寨内妇女界瞧不起，所以女孩子十几岁就开始学这些手艺。“洋布”的涌入，给人们的穿着带来新的选择。但是传统的审美观念和妇女们勤劳、节俭的天性，使她们中许多人仍保持着自织、自染、自穿的习惯。近年来，轻工业界掀起一股在民族传统工艺中寻求新生命源泉之风。布依族艺术有如一颗尘封的珍珠，仅仅透出一丝光彩，就引起人们的惊叹。安顺县石头寨，２１８户布依族家庭中有１／３经常向旅游者、艺术家、企业家出售自己的蜡染、织锦制品，每一批外国旅游者来到这个“蜡染之乡”，都会兴高采烈地花上数千元。县里的蜡染、织锦厂也都经常到这里购买布依族图案。安顺布依地毯厂，以“布依式”图案风格在地毯行业中独树一帜，产品全部出口，年创汇６０万美元。
    如果说，在我国由封闭走向开放的历史转变中，大西南比沿海地区面临更多困难，那么在大西南，布依族等少数民族又比汉族因袭着更沉重的历史负担。这是一个普遍的事实。
    关岭自治县顶云乡的布依族群众１９７９年率先冲破“左”的束缚，实行了联产到户责任制，但是，在农村第二步改革中，这里的群众却显得缺少搞商品经济的办法，大多数人仍靠种八分田谋生。虽然生产比过去有所发展，但迄今人均产值仍在２００元左右，吃粮在一二百公斤徘徊，有３０％农户还没有解决温饱问题。
    六马区同志对我说：“如果自己同自己纵向比，那么十年来我们确有不小进步；但是横向同全国比，变化就不显著，差距甚至在拉大。”这个区的干部很注意研究商品经济问题，但他们面临一个凭自己力量短期内难以克服的困难，就是山区交通不便，信息难通。全区１０个乡，２个通公路，５个晴通雨阻，还有３个乡根本不通。全区自然村通公路的只有９．８％。收桐籽季节，数百万斤桐籽是靠人挑马驮运出来的。有的农民到区里售猪，请人把猪抬出山，卖猪钱只够工钱加饭钱，带回家的仅有两根抬猪杠子。大山的阻隔使全区能上市的大牲畜不到总量的１０％，能上市的土布不到生产能力的５％，大量农副产品在山里自生自灭。许多布依族人不会讲汉语，限制了他们出山闯市场的勇气。迄今有些寨子找不到一个会读报的人，全区每２３．８平方公里才有一所公办小学，入学率实际不到５０％。全县教师超编，而这里公办教师还缺编２０％。有的师范毕业生分配来，连一年转正期都等不及就不辞而别。
    走出“夜郎国”，不是一蹴而就的事，需要几代人的勇气和毅力。走出“夜郎国”也不仅仅是布依族自己的事，需要全社会鼎力相助。
