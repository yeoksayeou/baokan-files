Yesterday's edition of the Gansu Daily published a report on the retaliation faced by Wang Yingxiu, a worker at the Jiangkou Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Li County, Gansu, and an outstanding correspondent in the county, for exposing malpractices.

Wang Yingxiu, 45, was once recognized as an outstanding core correspondent in Li County. However, after some of his critical articles, which were based on facts, were published, he incurred the displeasure of the leaders of the units he criticized and even faced retaliation.

In February 1987, Wang wrote an article titled "When Will the Tyranny of Electricity End?" which exposed the malpractices of the Li County Electric Power Department, such as cutting off electricity arbitrarily and causing public outrage. At the time, the then director of the Water and Electricity Department, Qian Zhengying, looked into the matter. After confirming the facts, the article was published in the "China Water and Electricity News." However, the county Water and Electricity Bureau ordered all basic-level power supply stations in the county to collect and seal the copies of this newspaper, prohibiting employees from circulating it.

On September 23, 1987, the "Farmers' Daily" published an article titled "What Tricks Is the Li County Supply and Marketing Cooperative Playing?" based on Wang's letter, exposing the cooperative's illegal sale of over 500 tons of fertilizer. The responsible parties were given disciplinary actions, including a one-year probation period and demotion. However, Wang himself was retaliated against by certain leaders of the county Supply and Marketing Cooperative, who withheld his salary for several months.

　　撰写批评稿件何罪之有？
    礼县通讯员王英秀竟遭打击
    本报兰州１月６日电  昨日出版的甘肃日报刊登甘肃礼县供销联社江口供销社职工、县优秀通讯员王英秀揭露不正之风屡遭打击报复的报道。
    今年４５岁的王英秀，曾被礼县评为优秀骨干通讯员。但是，他写的一些内容属实的批评稿见报后，却引起了被批评单位领导的不满，甚至遭到打击报复。王英秀１９８７年２月写了一篇《电霸作风何时休》的批评稿，揭露礼县供电部门以电谋私，随意断电、卡电引起民愤的问题。当时的水电部长钱正英曾过问过此事，在查清确有其事后，刊登在《中国水利电力报》上。但县水电局竟下令将全县各基层供电所订阅的这张报纸统统收回封存，禁止职工传阅。
    《农民日报》１９８７年９月２３日刊登了根据王英秀的来信采写的《礼县供销社捣什么“鬼”》，揭露该供销社倒卖５００多吨化肥的报道后，使当事人受到了留党察看一年、撤职降级等处分，但王英秀本人却遭县供销社个别负责人的报复，停发他几个月工资。
