Since August 1988, 13 farmers from Fengshan and Donglan counties in Guangxi have been frequently entering the deep mountain forests of Longdeng, Fenghuang, Laren, and Yangdeng in Fengshan County. Each of them carries a hunting rifle and is accompanied by 9 hunting dogs. They search, pursue, and capture musk deer from one mountain to the next, one forest to the next. They kill any musk deer they encounter, regardless of whether it is male or female, adult or young. They remove the musk pods from the male musk deer and sell them on the black market for high prices of 300 to 500 yuan each. If they encounter a female musk deer, they kill it for its meat. To date, over a hundred musk deer have been brutally killed by them, which is heartbreaking.

Musk deer are protected animals under national law. I appeal to the local government to take measures to protect wild musk deer and to punish those who engage in illegal hunting and killing.

　　野蛮捕杀
  　麝源遭殃
    １９８８年８月以来，广西凤山、东兰两县的１３个农民先后出没于凤山县长峒、凤凰、拉仁、央峒等地的深山林区，每人一支猎枪，带着９条猎狗。他们一座山一座山、一片林一片林地搜寻、围追、堵截、捕杀麝。他们只要见到麝，不论是雌的还是雄的，是成年麝还是幼麝，统统打死。他们将雄麝的麝囊挖出，以每个三五百元的高价到黑市上搞交易；如果遇到雌麝，就杀了吃肉。至今已有上百头麝惨死他们的枪下，令人痛心。
    麝属于国家保护动物。我呼吁当地政府采取措施，保护野生麝，并对滥捕滥杀麝的不法分子加以制裁。
