The Current State and Future of Legal Research

	– A Record of the "Decade of Legal System Construction Theoretical Discussion Conference"

How to evaluate the legal research of the past decade in the new era, the main problems currently existing in legal research, and how to further flourish and develop China's legal theory are currently hot topics of concern in the legal community. The China Law Society held the "Decade of Legal System Construction Theoretical Discussion Conference" in mid-November last year in Beijing. Experts and scholars from the legal and academic circles across the country attended the conference and had a heated discussion on the above issues.

	I. The Current State of Legal Research

The attendees discussed the path that China's legal research has taken over the past decade. They pointed out that, with the longitudinal development of legal theory as a reference, the decade-long journey of legal research in the new era is one of exploration and progress. This exploration and progress are most fundamentally reflected in the fact that many theoretical right-and-wrong issues artificially created in history (referring to theoretical viewpoints and even the standards for judging these viewpoints formed under the conditions of no normal academic debate, as well as strong external political pressure and political prejudice) have been basically clarified. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, legal studies have not only played an active social role in reform and opening up and in constructing a new culture but have also increasingly valued the right to exist in their own theoretical nature and the continuous perfection of their theoretical form, that is, they increasingly demand development and perfection according to the laws of legal studies themselves. Some representatives also listed the major advances made in legal theory research in the past decade, which are: (1) The theoretical principle of "equality before the law" has been restored and confirmed; (2) The erroneous view of "rule by man, not by law" has been thoroughly abandoned, and the majority of legal scholars have accepted the view of "governance by law"; (3) The erroneous practice of emphasizing policy over law or replacing law with policy has been criticized. The relationship between policy and law has been theoretically rectified to a certain extent; (4) The relationship between upholding the leadership of the Party and independent judicial proceedings has been clarified. The principle of "judicial independence" has been theoretically argued; (5) In some basic issues related to law, the rigid view of "taking class struggle as the key link" has been initially challenged, and so on.

However, if we change the perspective and focus on the theoretical state of legal reality, and take the perfection of the theoretical form of legal studies as a discipline itself as the standard, then the current state of legal research is not satisfactory. Some comrades further pointed out that the current problems in legal research are concentrated in the fact that the existence of legal theoretical value has not yet gained relative independence in the face of external social forces, and the development of legal theoretical form has not yet established the dynamic of conscious innovation and open thinking. Many attendees also believe that legal theory involves some major issues in China's system, but currently, legal theoretical research has not kept up with the pace of reform and opening up, still staying in the past based on the characteristics of the developed stage of socialism as envisioned by Marx and Engels for abstracting and generally describing theoretical principles, and being detached from the reality of the primary stage of socialism. Therefore, compared with the current pace and requirements of reform and opening up, legal research still seems relatively passive, backward, and dull.

	II. The Reasons for the Backwardness of Legal Research

The attendees also discussed the reasons for the backwardness of China's current legal research. The conference believed that this situation is indeed closely related to the important factor that legal studies in the new era carry historical baggage or a heavy historical burden, but more importantly, there are still a series of factors that constrain and influence the prosperity and development of legal studies. Some people believe that the biggest obstacle to the development of legal studies is that the legal community has not yet freed itself from the traditional legal theories of "class struggle theory," "rule model theory," and "obligation-centered theory."

Some attendees summarized the reasons for the backwardness of legal studies as follows: (1) Due to the influence of dogmatism, the starting point and destination of legal theorists' research problems are often based on books; (2) Legal research has been overly politicized, that is, legal studies have long lacked an independent status, and legal research has often been closely linked to the changing political situation, becoming an appendage of politics; (3) The methods of legal research also appear outdated and single. Some comrades also pointed out that the quality of the legal research team is not high enough, and many ideas are quite outdated, which also affects the further development of legal research.

	III. The Future of Legal Development

Reform and opening up, democracy, and the rule of law are the only possible choices and ways out for the Chinese people at present. Whether it is the deepening of reform and opening up or the construction of socialist democracy and the rule of law, it cannot merely stop at the level of changing some policies and institutional reforms. It must be led by the transformation of concepts, the liberation of thought, and the progress and prosperity of theory. Based on this understanding, the attendees believed that to change the current backward situation and to have a greater development of legal studies in China, the urgent task at present is to update and develop traditional legal theories. The key to the problem is to re-recognize the social and theoretical value of rights and obligations, to clarify that rights and obligations are the basic categories of legal studies that reflect and summarize the universal essence and connection of legal phenomena, and to reconstruct China's legal theory with this pair of basic categories as the core.

Some comrades emphasized that current legal research must be based on the reality of the primary stage of socialism. They believe that the legal theory in the near future should focus on the following issues: (1) The guiding significance of the theory of the primary stage of socialism for China's legal construction; (2) The essence and characteristics of China's legal system in the current stage; (3) The main contradictions and laws of development in China's legal construction in the current stage; (4) The functions of China's legal system in the current stage; (5) The coordinated development of reform and the rule of law; (6) The legal mechanism and its operation in reform; (7) Legal issues of "one country, two systems"; (8) Comparative studies of the rule of law; (9) Innovation of legal research methods; (10) Legal concepts adapted to the requirements of commodity economy and democratic politics.

### 法学研究的现状和未来——“十年法制建设理论讨论会”侧记

　　法学研究的现状和未来    
    ——“十年法制建设理论讨论会”侧记
    怎样评估新时期十年来的法学研究，当前在法学研究中存在的主要问题，以及如何进一步繁荣和发展我国法学理论，这是目前法学界普遍关注的热点问题。中国法学会于去年１１月中旬在北京召开了“十年法制建设理论讨论会”，出席会议的全国法律界、法学界的专家、学者，就上述问题展开了热烈讨论。
    　　　　一、法学研究的现状
    与会代表在谈到十年来我国法学研究所走过的道路时指出：以法学理论的纵向发展为参照系，新时期法学十年的历程是一个探索的历程，也是一个前进的历程。这种探索和前进，最基本的一点表现在，历史上人为地制造的理论是非（指在没有正常的学术争鸣以及在强大的外部政治压力和政治偏见之下形成的理论观点乃至判断这些观点的理论标准）许多已基本上得到了澄清。党的十一届三中全会以来，法学不仅为改革开放和建构新文化起到了积极的社会作用，而且已日益重视自身理论品性存在的权利，重视自身理论形态的不断完备，即日益要求按照法学自身的规律来求得发展和完善。有的代表还列举了法学理论研究在近十年来所取得的重大进展，它们是：（１）重新恢复和确认了“在法律面前人人平等”的理论原则；（２）彻底摒弃了“要人治，不要法治”的错误观点，法学界的大多数同志已接受了“以法治国”的观点；（３）批判了重政策、轻法律或者以政策代替法律的错误作法。从理论上大体摆正了政策与法律的关系；（４）明确了坚持党的领导和依法独立办案的关系。从理论上论证了“司法独立”的原则；（５）在有关法的一些基本问题上，“以阶级斗争为纲”的僵化观点已受到了初步冲击，等等。
    但是，如果变换一下视角，以法学现实的理论状况为焦点，以法学作为一门学科自身理论形态的完善为标准，则法学研究的现状是不尽如人意的。有的同志进一步指出，法学研究目前存在的问题，集中表现在法学理论价值的存在在外在的社会力量面前，还没有取得相对的独立性，法学理论形态的发展还没有确立自觉创新的动力和开放的思维方式。许多与会者还认为，法学理论涉及到我国体制中的一些重大问题，但目前法学理论的研究还没有跟上改革、开放的步伐，仍停留在过去根据马、恩设想的社会主义发达阶段的特点进行理论原则的抽象和一般描述，而与社会主义初级阶段的现实相脱离，因而，法学研究与当前改革、开放的节奏和要求相比，还显得相当被动、落后和沉闷。
    　　　　二、法学研究落后的原因
    与会同志还对造成我国法学研究现状落后的原因作了讨论。会议认为，这种状况固然与新时期的法学带有历史的后遗症或者说沉重的历史包袱这一重要因素密切相关，但更重要的是目前还存在着一系列制约和影响法学繁荣与发展的种种原因。有人认为，目前法学发展的最大障碍是，法学界还没有从传统法学理论中的“阶级斗争论”、“规则模式论”、“义务本位论”中解放出来。
    有的与会同志把造成法学落后的原因概括为以下三点：（１）由于受教条主义的影响，法学理论工作者研究问题的出发点和归宿往往以本本为规范；（２）法学研究过于政治化，即法学长期来没有自身的独立地位，法学研究常常与政治形势的变幻紧紧联系在一起，成为政治的附属物；（３）法学研究的方法也显得陈旧、单一。还有同志指出，法学研究队伍的素质不够高，许多观念比较陈旧，从而也影响了法学研究的进一步发展。
    　　　　三、法学发展的未来
    改革与开放、民主和法制是我国人民目前面临的唯一可能的选择与出路。而无论是改革和开放的深入，还是社会主义的民主与法制建设，都不能仅仅停留在某些政策的改变和体制变更的层面上，必须以观念的变革、思想的解放和理论的进步与繁荣为先导。基于这个认识，与会代表认为，为改变目前这种落后状况，使我国法学有一个较大的发展，当前的迫切任务就是更新和发展传统法学理论。而问题的关键，是要重新认识权利和义务的社会价值与理论价值，明确权利和义务是反映和概括法律现象的普遍本质和联系的法学基本范畴，并以权利和义务这对基本范畴为核心重构我国的法学理论。
    有的同志强调指出，当前的法学研究必须立足于社会主义初级阶段这一现实，他们认为近期内的法学理论应着重研究以下几个问题：（１）社会主义初级阶段理论对我国法制建设的指导意义；（２）我国现阶段法制的本质和特征；（３）我国现阶段法制建设的主要矛盾和发展规律；（４）我国现阶段法制的功能；（５）改革与法制的协调发展；（６）改革中的法制机制及其运行；（７）“一国两制”的法律问题；（８）法制的比较研究；（９）法学研究方法的革新；（１０）适应商品经济和民主政治要求的法律观。　　　　　　　　　（杜飞进）
