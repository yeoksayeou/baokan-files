The People's Bank of Anhui Province has fully utilized its role as the "central nervous system" to regulate and mobilize 4 billion yuan in funds over the past three months to ensure the smooth procurement of agricultural and sideline products. By the end of mid-December last year, the province had completed 97% of the contracted procurement tasks for grain and cotton, respectively, and had increased grain and cotton procurement by 60,000 tons and 10,000 tons compared to 1987. Their specific measures include:

	— Strictly controlling loans. By the end of August last year, the province had over 10 billion yuan in excess loans. The provincial bank immediately supervised various specialized banks to revise their monthly loan recovery plans. Each bank used economic, administrative, legal, and publicity methods to quickly recover overdue loans and general loans totaling 16.1 billion yuan, effectively supporting the procurement of agricultural and sideline products.

	— Timely adjusting the direction of short-term loans. In September last year, the provincial bank recovered 5.5 billion yuan in loans from the Construction Bank and non-bank financial institutions, all of which were used as funds for grain and cotton procurement. By the end of November, while increasing short-term loans to other specialized banks by a total of 7.67 billion yuan, it increased loans to the Agricultural Bank alone by 7.7 billion yuan, alleviating the shortage of funds.

	— Strictly enforcing credit principles and utilizing the leverage of interest rates. In response to the problem of procurement departments occupying and misappropriating over 1 billion yuan in loans, the provincial bank imposed a 30% interest surcharge on procurement departments that overstocked and occupied loans, and a 50% interest surcharge on those that occupied and misappropriated procurement funds. These measures prompted procurement departments to promptly transport agricultural and sideline products.

　　保证农副产品收购工作顺利进行    
    安徽融通资金４０亿元支农
    本报讯  安徽省人民银行充分发挥“中枢神经”的调节功能，３个多月来千方百计为收购农副产品融通资金４０亿元。截至去年１２月中旬末，全省已分别完成粮棉合同定购任务的９７％与９０％，粮棉分别比１９８７年多收６万吨与１万吨。他们的具体做法是：
    ——坚决压缩贷款。到去年８月底全省超计划贷款达１０多亿元，省人行立即督促各专业银行修订分月收贷计划，各家银行采用经济、行政、法律、宣传等办法，全力迅速收回逾期贷款与一般贷款１６．１亿元，有效地支援了农副产品的收购。
    ——及时调整短期贷款投向。去年９月份，省行就收回对建设银行和非银行金融机构的贷款５．５亿元，全部用作粮棉收购资金。到１１月底，在对其它专业银行新增短期贷款共７．６７亿元的同时，向农业银行一家就增加７．７亿元，缓和了资金的短缺。
    ——严格执行信贷原则，运用利率杠杆作用。针对农副产品收购部门挤占、挪用贷款１亿多元的问题，省行通过对超储积压占用贷款的收购部门加收利息３０％，对挤占、挪用收购资金加息５０％等手段，促使收购部门及时调运农副产品。
