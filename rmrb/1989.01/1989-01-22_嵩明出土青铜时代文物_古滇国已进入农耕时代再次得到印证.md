The living history book of ancient Dian culture has been opened once again: After more than two months of excavation, archaeologists in Yunnan have recently unearthed a large number of exquisite Bronze Age artifacts in the suburbs of Songming County, northeast of Dian Lake.

The excavation site is a magnificent ancient tomb cluster. On a slope covering more than 2,000 square meters, nearly a thousand tombs from various dynasties are arranged and layered. Archaeologists focused on excavating 162 Bronze Age tombs.

The excavation results have confirmed the experts' inferences: the 400-plus artifacts unearthed from these 162 tombs are all cultural relics from the Dian Lake region dating back two to three thousand years ago.

These artifacts include bronze vessels, pottery, and jade items. Some of the decorative items and weapons are rare treasures, with exquisite craftsmanship and intricate patterns that leave one in awe. Some of the artifacts are being discovered for the first time.

Archaeologists discovered over a hundred pottery spinning wheels among the tombs, a rare find in the archaeological history of the Yunnan Plateau. Among the unearthed artifacts, there are also farming tools such as sickles, providing new physical evidence that the Dian Lake region had already entered the agricultural era.

Previously, local farmers had unearthed some Bronze Age casting molds—stone molds—while digging for soil in this tomb area. Experts confirmed that these molds, along with the 400-plus rare artifacts unearthed later, are all cultural relics of the ancient Dian Kingdom. This important discovery indicates that the Bronze Age tomb artifacts unearthed in Songming are indeed the masterpieces of ancient Dian craftsmen, rather than products from the Yellow River region that later flowed into that area.

　　嵩明出土青铜时代文物
    古滇国已进入农耕时代再次得到印证
    新华社昆明１月２１日电（记者李承祖）记录古代滇国文化的活史书又一次被翻开：云南考古工作者经过两个多月的发掘，新近在滇池东北部的嵩明县城郊出土了大批精美的青铜时代文物。
    发掘现场是一片壮观的古墓群，在方圆２０００多平方米的山坡上，排列和重叠着近千座历代墓葬。考古工作者重点发掘了其中１６２座青铜时代墓葬。
    发掘成果印证了专家的推断：这１６２座墓葬中出土的４００多件文物，均属两三千年前滇池地区部族的文化遗存。
    这些文物包括青铜器、陶器、玉器，有些装饰品和兵器属稀世珍品，其工艺造型、纹饰图案使人叹为观止，有的文物尚属首次发现。
    考古工作者在墓葬群中发现了上百个随葬的陶纺轮，这一发现为云南高原考古史上所罕见。出土文物中还有爪镰等农具，为证实滇池地区当时已进入农耕时代找到了新的实物依据。
    在此之前，当地农民在这片墓地附近取土时，曾挖掘到一些青铜时代的铸造模具——石范。专家确认，它们与后来出土的４００多件稀世文物同属古代滇国的文化遗存。这一重要发现说明，嵩明青铜时代墓葬的出土文物确实是古代滇国工匠的杰作，而非黄河流域生产后流入到那里。
