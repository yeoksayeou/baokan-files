The most precious thing in the world is true emotion – observations from Nanchang City Deaf-Mute School

    The blackboard reads, “Lili has placed the chalk on the book again.” There are five drawings hanging next to it. The classroom is filled with 20 students. This is a third-grade language arts class.

    Teacher Wu of Nanchang City Deaf-Mute School extends her left hand, using her five agile fingers to make various phonetic alphabet gestures. What takes only a few minutes to teach in a regular second-grade class takes half a period to teach deaf-mute third-graders. Teacher Wu’s physical and mental energy is greatly consumed.

    This is a special kind of education. Deaf-mute students find it hard to accept abstract knowledge; they need imagery, pictures, gestures, understanding, and love.

    Deaf-mute students are aware of their disabilities, and thus have a very strong sense of self-respect. The reporter walked around the school and saw that these students were all good-looking, dressed in the latest fashions, and had sturdy builds. They communicated with each other using hand gestures. When they saw a stranger, they would stare at you with wide eyes, not using any gestures, and then walk away with their chests puffed out. During break time, they preferred to stay in school and play with their classmates rather than go home. The people who understand them best are their teachers. The school offers a rhythmics class to train them in regular movements, exercise, learn dance, and cultivate their sense of perception.

    Several students around the age of 10 went out and saw an unlocked bicycle parked by the road. They pushed it to the school to play with. After playing, they put the bike in the school’s bike shed, planning to play with it again next time. The teacher noticed this and immediately sent the bike to the police station to be returned to the owner. The police station called in these few students, who were anxious, angry, and scared, scratching their heads and gesturing wildly. This really worried the homeroom teacher, who had to explain to the police station that the students did not genuinely steal the bike; they just did not have the concept of “stealing” in their minds, they were just playing. The love of the teachers at the deaf-mute school moved the police officers, and also made the students regard the teachers as their closest people.

    The deaf-mute school is an eight-year continuous education system. By the seventh grade, they are taught sewing and drawing. The reporter saw some students, under the guidance of their teachers, making very beautiful school uniforms. The reporter also saw oil paintings drawn by students hanging in the school meeting room, which were also quite good. The graduates of the previous few classes of this school were arranged jobs in factories under the Nanchang Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau after graduation. However, the recent class is still unemployed at home.

    After walking around the deaf-mute school, some problems were also noticed. This school does not have a library, activity room, or language training room. 278 students can only play in one basketball court, making the space feel cramped. The 12-square-meter teacher’s office has to seat 8 people. Teachers sitting back-to-back have to stand up to let the person behind them open a drawer. The school’s dining hall is a first-class dangerous building. There is a student dormitory building that the district has designated as a first-class dangerous building, but after the Municipal Education Commission inspected it, they said some schools have even worse conditions, so it became a third-class dangerous building. The school’s office funds are severely insufficient, and the office fees issued by higher authorities are not even enough to pay for water and electricity. Additionally, the teaching methods are quite primitive.

　　人间最贵是真情
    ——南昌市聋哑学校见闻
    本报记者  赵相如
    “丽丽又把粉笔放在本子上。”黑板上写着这么一个句子，同时挂着５张画。教室坐着２０个学生。这是三年级的语文课。
    南昌市聋哑学校的吴老师左手伸着５个灵巧指头，做着各种拼音字母的手势。教普通学校二年级学生不过几分钟的事，可是对三年级的聋哑学生，吴老师得教半堂课，体力精力的消耗很大。
    这是一种特殊的教育。聋哑学生对抽象的知识很难接受，他们需要形象、图画、手势、理解和爱。
    聋哑学生知道自己残缺，因而自尊心特强。记者在学校随意走了一下，看到这些学生一个个眉清目秀，穿着时髦，长得结实。他们互相之间用手势表达感情，见到生人过来，即瞪着双眼注视你，不打手势，挺起胸走开了。休息时间，他们愿意在学校里和同学有玩有笑，不愿在家。最了解他们的就是老师了。学校开了一门律动课，训练有规律的动作，练体育、学舞蹈，培养他们的感受能力。
    几个１０岁左右的学生外出，见一辆自行车没锁，停在路边，便一起推上车去玩了。玩完后把车放到学校停车棚里，准备下次再玩。老师发觉了，马上把车子送派出所，转还车主。派出所把这几个学生叫去，他们又急又气又怕，抓耳挠腮比划。这可把班主任急坏了，一边得向派出所解释，学生并非真正偷车，他们的心里还没有形成“偷”的概念，他们只是贪玩；同时又得批评这些学生，告诉他们这不是好学生该干的。聋哑学校的老师对学生的爱，感动了派出所警察，同时也使学生把老师当作自己最亲近的人。
    聋哑学校是八年一贯制。到了七年级，就给他们上缝纫课，上图画课。记者看到一些学生在老师指点下缝制的校服，很漂亮。也看到学校会议室里挂着学生画的油画，画得也不错。这个学校前几届的学生毕业后，南昌市民政局尽力在所属工厂里安排工作。但最近这一届还待业在家。
    在聋哑学校走了一圈，也看到一些问题。这个学校没有图书室、活动室、语言训练室。２７８名学生只能在一个篮球场内活动，空间显得窄小。１２平方米的教师办公室，每间要坐８个人。背靠背坐的教师，谁要打开抽屉，背后的那位就得站起来让。学校的餐厅是一级危房。有一幢学生宿舍楼，被区里定为一级危房，而市教委来查后说，有的学校还有更破烂的，它便成了三级危房。学校里办公经费严重不足，上级发下的办公费光付水电费都不够。另外，教学手段也相当原始。
