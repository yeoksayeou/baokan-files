Prosecutorial agencies nationwide have investigated over 20,000 reported cases since launching their reporting work in July last year. They have initiated investigations into 4,075 cases, prosecuted 476 individuals, and sentenced 116 criminals. They have also recovered illicit funds and properties worth 126.9 million yuan.

Zhang Siquan, Deputy Prosecutor-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, today briefed the media on the progress of the reporting work.

By the end of last November, 2,434 procuratorates across the country had established reporting centers or set up reporting hotlines. Among them, 98.7% of the procuratorates in large and medium-sized cities had initiated reporting work.

Statistics show that 34.5% of the reported cases involve state officials suspected of embezzlement and bribery, with over 900 cases involving amounts exceeding 10,000 yuan.

Out of the 101,000 reported cases handled by the procuratorates, 12,000 involve Communist Party members, 17 involve provincial and ministerial-level officials, and over 200 involve bureau-level officials.

Over the past five months, procuratorates nationwide have received 470 individuals who turned themselves in, recovering over 45 million yuan in illicit funds.

From July to November last year, procuratorates at various levels received over 30,000 anonymous reports, accounting for 33% of the total reported cases. According to a sample survey, many anonymous reports were made by informed individuals, with the information being largely accurate or basically accurate, accounting for about 60%.

The Supreme People's Procuratorate has formulated and today issued the "Provisional Regulations on the Reporting Work of People's Procuratorates," which provides detailed regulations on the acceptance, transfer, initiation, follow-up, conclusion, and response to reported cases, as well as the protection and rewards for reporters.

Zhang Siquan also announced that the reporting center of the Supreme People's Procuratorate will officially commence operations on January 10.
