Restoring the "Youth Home"

In the past few years, our county established a large number of "Youth Homes." Many Young Pioneers and youth gathered in their own "home," eagerly seeking knowledge, entertainment, and beauty, feeling that life was particularly fulfilling and meaningful.

However, now most of the "Youth Homes" in our county are in name only. The "Youth Home" in Dahong Village, Huangtupu Town, which was awarded the title of "Youth Home" by the Provincial Youth League, Provincial Military Region, and Provincial Cultural Bureau, originally had 6 rooms totaling 260 square meters of activity space, with activity equipment worth over 1,000 yuan and more than 10,000 books. Now, the game room and science room have been rented out, the basketball court has become a precast component processing plant, and the library is locked up. In the Songlinqiao Village of Baidi Market, the "Youth Home" jointly built with a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, the activity equipment has been largely lost, the doorstep is damaged, the dance hall lights have disappeared, and out of the 2,000-plus books, only about 300 remain. The already established "Farmer Technical Learning Room" has been turned into a "Building Materials Storage Room."

We suggest that the relevant leading departments save our "Youth Home"!

　　恢复“青年之家”
    前些年，我县先后建立了一大批“青年之家”。许多团员和青年欢聚在自己的“家”里，如饥似渴地求知、求乐、求美，感到生活格外充实而有意义。
    但是，现在我县大部分“青年之家”已名存实亡了。曾荣获团省委、省军区、省文化厅授予“青年之家”匾额的黄土铺镇大荣村“青年之家”，原拥有６间房屋，共计２６０平方米的活动场地，有价值１０００多元的活动器材和上万册图书。如今，游艺室、科普室被出租，篮球场成了预制件加工场，图书室由“铁将军”把门。白地市区松林桥村与解放军某部共建的“青年之家”，那里的活动器材已大量散失，门槛破损，舞厅彩灯不翼而飞，２０００多册图书只剩下３００来册了，已经建起的“农民技术学习室”也变成了“建筑材料保管室”。
    建议有关领导部门救救我们的“青年之家”！
