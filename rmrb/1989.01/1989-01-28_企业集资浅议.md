Currently, some enterprises are enthusiastic about fundraising, which is detrimental to the improvement of the economic environment and the rectification of economic order.

According to a survey by the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China's Sichuan Branch, the majority of corporate fundraising comes from savings deposits. The Siming County Department Store raised 285,000 yuan, half of which came from savings deposits at the Industrial and Commercial Bank, about 30% from credit cooperative deposits and loans, and 20% from private lending (part of which is savings deposits). This reduces the funding sources for state banks. Moreover, the scale and direction of fundraising are difficult to control. According to a survey by the Siming County Branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank, out of the total planned fundraising amount for 15 enterprises in this county, less than half was approved by the People's Bank. These funds were used for fixed asset investments, accounting for 70.3%. Furthermore, the interest rates for fundraising are shockingly high. For example, the Siming County Food Company and the Refrigeration Plant have an annual interest rate of 25% for fundraising, which is 2.89 times the bank interest rate; the Hechuan Silk Mill has an annual interest rate of 26.64% for fundraising, which is 4.1 times the bank interest rate, causing a large amount of bank deposits to be transferred.

Some banks, in order to consolidate and expand their deposits, have adopted measures such as selling goods in exchange for deposits. Due to different procurement channels, deposit interest rates and selling prices in a region are not uniform, making many depositors anxious and damaging the bank's image.

The issue of how the central bank can regulate, control, and manage the movement of funds throughout society urgently needs to be addressed in both theory and practice.

　　企业集资浅议
    目前，有些企业热衷于搞集资，这对治理经济环境，整顿经济秩序很不利。
    据工商银行四川分行的调查，企业集资来源多数是储蓄存款。简阳县百货公司集资２８．５万元，其中一半是工商银行储蓄存款，３０％左右是信用社存款和贷款，２０％是民间借贷（部分系储蓄存款）。这样一来，就减少了国家银行的资金来源。另外，集资规模和资金投向难以控制。据工商银行简阳县支行调查，这个县１５家企业计划集资的总额中，经人民银行批准的不足一半。这些资金用于固定资产投资达７０．３％，再者，集资的利率高得惊人。如简阳县食品公司、冷冻厂集资年息为２５％，为银行利率的２．８９倍；合川丝厂集资年息为２６．６４％，为银行利率的４．１倍，造成银行存款大量转移。
    有的银行为巩固和扩大存款，采取了存款实物奖售等措施，由于进货的渠道不同，在一个地区的存款利率、销售价格也不统一，使广大储户惶恐不安，银行的形象受到损害。
    中央银行如何发挥调节、控制、管理全社会资金运动，这个问题在理论和实践上都急需解决。
