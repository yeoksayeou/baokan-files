Libyan People's General Committee's Transport and Maritime Bureau Issues Statement
Accusing U.S. Fighter Jets of Endangering Civilian Aircraft Safety
U.S. Welcomes Libya's Return of American Pilot's Remains

CAIRO, Jan. 13 (Xinhua) — Libya today accused two U.S. fighter jets of endangering the safety of a Libyan civilian aircraft flying from Tripoli to Istanbul on January 10.

The official Libyan news agency quoted a statement from the Libyan People's General Committee's Transport and Maritime Bureau as saying that when the Libyan Boeing 707 aircraft had just left Tripoli's communication space and entered Athens' communication space, the U.S. aircraft began creating noise interference. The Libyan pilot observed that one aircraft flew at high speed on both sides of the Libyan aircraft and then flew back.

The statement said that afterwards, at about 16 kilometers away from the Libyan aircraft, one U.S. fighter jet appeared on each side, flying at almost the same altitude as the Libyan aircraft for 14 minutes.

The news agency said that Libya had lodged a protest with the United States through the Arab Civil Aviation Organization and the International Civil Aviation Organization.

On January 4, U.S. fighter jets had shot down two Libyan fighter jets over the Mediterranean Sea.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 13 (Xinhua) — The United States today welcomed Libya's return of the remains of an American pilot.

The Libyan news agency earlier today said that Libya would return the remains of an American pilot today. The pilot's aircraft was shot down during an attack on the Libyan capital Tripoli on April 14, 1986.

U.S. State Department spokesman Redman said that the United States welcomes this action by Libya and said, "This is Libya's humanitarian duty."

According to reports, the remains of the American pilot have been transported to Rome and handed over to U.S. officials through Vatican representatives and Italian officials.

In recent times, the United States has been accusing Libya of building chemical weapons factories and threatening to take military action against the factories. Nine days ago, U.S. aircraft shot down two Libyan fighter jets over the Mediterranean Sea. Redman denied that Libya's decision was related to the above two incidents.

Redman said that the United States had not discussed the issue of returning the remains of the American pilot to the United States with Libya. Libya notified the United States through Vatican officials.

　　利比亚总人民委员会交通和海运局发表声明
    指责美国战斗机危及利民航机安全
    美欢迎利比亚交还美飞机驾驶员遗骸
    新华社开罗１月１３日电  利比亚今天指责两架美国战斗机１０日危及从的黎波里飞往伊斯坦布尔的一架利比亚民航机的安全。
    利比亚官方通讯社援引利比亚总人民委员会交通和海运局的一项声明报道说，当利比亚波音７０７飞机刚飞离的黎波里通讯空间，进入雅典通讯空间的时候，美国飞机就开始制造噪音干扰。利比亚机长观察到，一架飞机先在利比亚飞机左右高速飞行，然后向后飞去。
    这项声明说，此后，在离利比亚飞机约１６公里处，左右两侧各出现了一架美国战斗机，以差不多同样的高度，在利比亚飞机两侧飞行了１４分钟。
    这家通讯社说，利比亚已通过阿拉伯民航组织和国际民航组织向美国提出了抗议。
    本月４日，美国战斗机曾在地中海上空击落了两架利比亚战斗机。
    新华社华盛顿１月１３日电　美国今天欢迎利比亚归还一名美国飞机驾驶员的遗骸。
    利比亚通讯社今天早些时候说，利比亚将于今天归还一名美国飞机驾驶员的遗骸。这位驾驶员所驾驶的飞机是在１９８６年４月１４日袭击利比亚首都的黎波里时被击落的。
    美国国务院发言人雷德曼说，美国欢迎利比亚的这一行动。并说，“这是利比亚的人道主义义务。”
    据报道，美国飞行员的遗骸已被运往罗马，经梵蒂冈代表和意大利官员转交给美国。
    最近以来，美国一直在指责利比亚建造化学武器工厂，并扬言要对工厂采取军事行动。９天前，美国飞机在地中海上空击落了两架利比亚的战斗机。雷德曼否认利比亚的这一决定同以上两件事有联系。
    雷德曼说，美国没有同利比亚讨论将美国飞行员遗骸交还美国的问题，利比亚是通过梵蒂冈的官员通知美国的。
