Through several storms and seasons, readers may still recall that ten years ago, songs like "The Moon Represents My Heart" and "Little Town Story" from Hong Kong and Taiwan were considered decadent tunes. However, now they have proudly entered the ranks of the "New Era Top Ten Songs of the Decade," selected by units such as the People's Daily. Many lovers of popular music, like the song "Youthful Ambitions Unspoken" that sings "Enduring hardships, steadfast heart unchanged," have finally won a place in the realm of mass culture: forty-eight popular songs and ten popular singers were honored as "golden songs" and "golden stars," and they all gathered together on the pages of the People's Daily.

Change is the most simple truth. Like many young friends, the author has also been swept up by the tide of popular music. Songs by Julio Iglesias, Madonna, Richie and Jackson, such as "We Are the World," and songs by Su Rui and Chien Chien, I all enjoy listening to. In the dormitories of female students at the Foreign Language Institute, the most frequently seen photos are those of Tan Yonglin and Qi Qin. Therefore, when we browse through the "New Era Top Ten Songs of the Decade," we will each have our own feelings. From "Shepherd's Song" to "Night at the Military Port," from "Bacchus Song" to "Nothing to My Name," from "Three Hundred and Sixty-Five Miles" to "Night Falls," they clearly reflect the attitudes of millions of music lovers. The author has some thoughts to share with the readers. First, among the winning songs, a considerable proportion are theme songs from movies and TV series (especially TV dramas). This once again shows the close relationship between popular music and mass visual culture. The inclusion of theme songs from films and TV series such as "Wasted Years," "Snow City," "Shaolin Temple," "Tales of the Yangtze River," and "Red Sorghum" is not worth mentioning. Even the old song "The Song of Laz" and "The Lost Straw Hat" are still remembered by the audience, which makes one marvel at the power of film and television transmission, but also makes one sigh at the lack of vitality and freshness in the music scene. It is truly "White clouds drift, singing freely, nothing has changed." Second, the cultural content of Chinese popular music is still somewhat shallow, and the tendency of songs being too focused on a single theme is still quite evident. Songs like "The Fifteenth Moon" and "My Chinese Heart" are naturally excellent works with a soft yet strong, lofty beauty. "Nothing to My Name" can also be considered a rough and deep, simple and unrestrained Chinese style, but such songs are few in number. Most of the winning songs are still immersed in the "ocean of love."

The song "Approximately in Winter" that made it onto the golden song list sings, "You ask me when I will return home, I think it will be approximately in winter." This winter, the selection activity for "golden songs" and "golden stars" reflects a kind of guidance and choice for popular culture. Then, in the new year, can Chinese popular music get out of the crossroads, form a distinct national style, and give it rich content? At the end of 1988, on the occasion of the "Last Supper," we hope that in the winter of next year.

　　“新时期十年金曲榜”观感
    吴联庆
    几度风雨、几度春秋。读者也许还记得，十年前飘荡于小巷深处的《月亮代表我的心》《小城故事》等港台歌曲，曾被视之为靡靡之音，然而，现在它们堂而皇之地跨入了《人民日报》等单位举办评选的“新时期十年金曲榜”之列。众多的通俗歌曲的热爱者，如同一首《少年壮志不言愁》的歌曲所唱“历尽磨难痴心不改”，流行歌曲终于赢得了它在大众文化中的一席之地：四十八首流行歌曲和十名通俗歌手被誉为“金曲”和“金星”，并济济一堂地登上了《人民日报》。
    物换星移是最朴素的真理。笔者和许多青年朋友一样，也被流行歌曲的大潮所“卷入”。如胡里奥、玛丹娜的抒情歌曲、里奇和杰克逊的《我们同属一个世界》以及苏芮、千百惠等演唱的歌，我都喜欢听；在外语学院女学生的宿舍里，见得最多的则是谭永麟和齐秦的照片。因此，当我们浏览“新时期十年金曲榜”时，定会各有一番感触。从《牧羊曲》到《军港之夜》，从《酒神曲》到《一无所有》，从《三百六十五里路》到《夜色阑珊》，清晰地反映出亿万歌曲爱好者的心态。笔者有如下一些感想想和读者作些交流。其一，获奖歌曲中电影、电视剧（尤其是连续剧）的插曲占了相当大的比例，这再次表明流行歌曲和大众影视文化的密切关系。《蹉跎岁月》、《雪城》、《少林寺》、《话说长江》和《红高粱》等影视插曲的入选暂且不说，甚至“白发苍苍”的流浪者唱的《拉兹之歌》和“那顶失落的草帽”仍未被观众忘却，这既让人惊叹影视传播手段的力量，又使人不免惆怅于歌坛的活力和新鲜度不足。这真是“白云悠悠尽情地唱，什么都没有改变”。其二，我国流行歌曲的文化内涵还嫌单薄，歌曲情趣“单行道”的倾向仍较明显。《十五的月亮》、《我的中国心》等歌曲自然是柔中有刚、富有崇高美的佳作。《一无所有》也堪称粗犷深厚、质朴奔放的中国风格，但这样的歌曲所占比例不多，大部分获奖歌曲还是沉浸在“爱的海洋”中。
    荣登金曲榜的《大约在冬季》里这样唱道：“你问我何时归故里，我想大约会是在冬季”。今年的冬季，“金曲”和“金星”的评选活动，体现了对通俗文化的一种引导和选择。那么，在新的一年里，我国的流行歌曲能否走出十字路口，形成鲜明的民族风格并赋予丰富的内涵呢？在一九八八年“最后的晚餐”之际，我们寄希望于：明年冬季。
