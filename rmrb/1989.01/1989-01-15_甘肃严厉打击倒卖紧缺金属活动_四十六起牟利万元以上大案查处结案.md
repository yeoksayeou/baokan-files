Gansu Province has been strictly cracking down on the illegal trading of scarce metals such as aluminum, copper, and nickel, and has strengthened the investigation of major cases. From last October to early January this year, 46 cases of illegal trading with profits exceeding 100,000 yuan have been investigated and closed.

Gansu is a major production area for important metals such as aluminum, copper, nickel, zinc, and steel. Some organizations or companies in the circulation sector have exploited the "dual-track" pricing system, using various means to engage in illegal operations and trading of these raw materials. The Lanzhou Non-Ferrous Metals Development Company sold steel ingot quotas at a price increase of 1,950 to 2,500 yuan per ton, earning 774,000 yuan; the Gansu Yatai Decorative Materials Engineering Company sold 49.999 tons of aluminum ingots at a price increase from 5,926.19 yuan to 8,200 yuan per ton, and 9.823 tons of aluminum ingots from 9,500 yuan to 12,041.43 yuan per ton, earning 138,000 yuan in two transactions; the Yushan Mining Bureau No. 1 Comprehensive Trade Company purchased 168 refrigerators and 140 color TVs from Shenzhen at negotiated prices and sold them at flat prices to the Liancheng Aluminum Plant. Using this as a condition, they purchased 81 tons of aluminum ingots from the Liancheng Aluminum Plant at 4,000 yuan per ton and then resold them at 6,000 yuan per ton, earning 162,000 yuan.

Relevant departments in Gansu Province have overcome various obstacles and lawfully dealt with these 46 major cases: the 3.4 million yuan of illegal profits have all been confiscated and turned over to the state treasury, and a fine of 1.9 million yuan has been imposed.

The Gansu Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government recently pointed out that the investigation of economic law violations must always focus on the illegal trading of scarce metal raw materials, important production materials, and popular consumer goods. For cases that are serious in nature and have a significant impact on the public, special inspection teams should be organized to conduct in-depth investigations. For major and important cases involving leading organs and leading cadres, the investigation should be thorough, and there should be no leniency.

　　甘肃严厉打击倒卖紧缺金属活动
    四十六起牟利万元以上大案查处结案
    本报讯  甘肃省严厉打击倒卖铝、铜、镍等国家紧缺金属原材料的活动，加强对重大案件的清查。去年１０月至今年１月上旬，对非法获利万元以上的４６起倒卖案件已查处结案。
    甘肃是我国铝、铜、镍、锌、钢等重要金属原材料的主要产区，有些流通领域的团体或公司，钻价格“双轨制”的空子，采取各种手段非法经营、倒卖这些原材料。兰州有色金属开发公司将吨钢锭指标，每吨加价１９５０元至２５００元倒卖，从中获利７７．４万元；甘肃雅泰装饰材料工程公司将４９．９９９吨铝锭从每吨５９２６．１９元加价为８２００元，将９．８２３吨铝锭由９５００元加价为１２０４１．４３元倒卖，两次获利１３．８万元；窑街矿务局一矿综合贸易公司从深圳议价购进电冰箱１６８台，彩电１４０台，用平价销售给连城铝厂，以此为条件从连城铝厂以每吨４０００元价格套购铝锭８１吨，然后以每吨６０００元倒卖，从中获利１６．２万元。
    甘肃省有关部门冲破种种阻力，依法对这４６起重大案件作了严肃处理：对其非法牟取的３４０万元，全部没收上缴国库，并罚款１９０万元。
    甘肃省委、省政府最近指出，查处经济违法案件要始终抓住倒卖国家紧缺金属原材料、重要生产资料和紧俏日用消费品这些重点，对那些性质严重，在群众中影响很大的案件，组织专门检查组重点清查；对牵扯到领导机关、领导干部的大案、要案追根到底，决不手软。
