The Panda Electronics Group has focused on adjusting its product structure and actively developing export products, achieving significant economic benefits. In 1988, the group earned over $40 million in foreign exchange from exports, a 72% increase over the previous year.

The group has adopted four methods to change its product structure to better meet the needs of the international market.

First, "product dissemination." This involves transferring market-demand products with mature technology, such as the "Panda" brand of electronic products, to smaller and medium-sized enterprises. This helps these enterprises phase out outdated and slow-selling products. For example, the Nanjing Television Factory, which had struggled with product quality for over a decade, saw significant improvements after switching to producing "Panda" televisions. Its annual production increased from tens of thousands of units to 400,000 units, and its annual profits and taxes rose from over 1 million yuan to over 20 million yuan, making it a leading enterprise in the province and city.

Second, "technological radiation." This leverages the group's technological advantages to help other enterprises develop new export products and phase out outdated ones. In 1988, the group collaborated with enterprises to develop 21 new products, revitalizing several backward enterprises.

Third, "joint development." This involves collaborating with domestic universities, research institutes, and foreign companies to develop high-tech products, ensuring that "Panda" products quickly reach international standards. In 1988, the group collaborated with the former Ministry of Electronics' 54th Research Institute to develop a small satellite data communication ground station. The product, sold to the United States in 120 units, received high praise from American customers for its quality and performance.

Fourth, "establishing export-oriented joint ventures." The group has established four joint ventures in Shenzhen, Dongguan, Hainan, and other regions with foreign partners to produce export products. It has also set up a small satellite data communication ground station company in San Francisco, USA. The group's export products have expanded from consumer goods like televisions to investment goods such as satellite communication ground stations and voltage stabilizers. The proportion of export products has been increasing year by year.

　　横向联合打开了外向型经济通途
    熊猫电子集团努力发展出口产品
    本报讯  熊猫电子集团注重产品结构的调整，积极发展出口创汇产品，取得显著的经济效益，１９８８年，出口创汇４０００多万美元，比上年增长７２％。
    该集团采取四种办法改变不适应国外市场需要的产品结构。
    一是“产品扩散”。即把市场需求量大、技术成熟的“熊猫”名牌电子产品，转移到一些中小企业去生产，帮助这些企业甩掉落后、滞销的产品。南京电视机厂过去１０多年产品质量上不去，转产“熊猫”电视机以后，技术水平有很大提高，年产量由几万台增长到４０万台，年利税由１００多万元提高到２０００多万元，成为省、市的先进企业。
    二是“技术辐射”。即充分发挥集团的技术优势，帮助一些企业开发创汇新产品，淘汰落后产品。１９８８年，集团与企业联合开发的新产品共２１种，使一些落后企业恢复了生机。
    三是“合作开发”。即同国内的大专院校、研究所和外国的大公司联合开发高技术产品，使“熊猫”产品尽快达到当代国际水平。１９８８年，集团同原电子部第５４研究所合作开发的小型数据卫星通信地面站，去年销往美国１２０套，质量和性能水平受到美方高度评价。
    四是“办外向型合资企业”。该集团已在深圳、东莞、海南等地与外商合资兴办了４家专门生产出口产品的企业，在美国旧金山合资开办了小型数据卫星通信地面站公司等，出口的“熊猫”电子产品已从电视机等消费类产品，扩大到卫星通信地面站、稳压电源设备等投资类产品，出口产品的比重逐年大幅度增加。
