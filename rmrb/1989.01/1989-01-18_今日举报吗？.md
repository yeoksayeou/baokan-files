Title: To Report Today?

A few days ago, in a certain city, someone discovered that a shop had arbitrarily raised the price of bicycles. They immediately dialed the hotline number published in the newspaper to report this, but after 20 minutes, no one answered. They puzzledly asked someone else, “To report today?”

The original intention of setting up a hotline was to allow the public to report illegal and disorderly behavior quickly and promptly, so that relevant departments could handle it swiftly. This requires the departments that set up the hotline to treat reports as seriously as fire alarms, with someone always available to answer. The occurrence of no one answering the phone indicates that some departments do not take the hotline seriously, treating it as something that can be done or ignored. I suspect that these departments with phones that no one answers are using the hotline as a mere decoration to appease higher-ups' inspections.

The hotline should include several steps: recording (always having someone to answer), reporting (quickly informing the relevant authorities), investigating (promptly assigning the case for verification), and feedback (reporting the results back to the informant). If any of these steps are missing, the hotline will be ineffective.

People have seen enough of the deceptive "facades" from the past and are fed up with them. If such "facades" are still being constructed today, it will cause the public to develop a "reverse psychology," making many things that were originally widely supported by the public difficult to accomplish.

### “今日举报吗？”

　　“今日举报吗？”
    陈升钧
    前几天，在某市，有人发现一家商店擅自抬高自行车价格，即按报纸上公布的有关举报电话号码拨号，足有２０分钟，没人接电话，他疑惑地问别人：“今日举报吗？”
    设立举报电话的初衷，无非是想让群众能够迅速及时地举报违法乱纪行为，以方便于有关部门从快处理。这就要求设立举报电话的机关视举报如火警，每时每刻有人接。出现无人接电话的事，说明某些部门并未把举报电话当正儿八经的事办，似乎有也可，无也可。我疑心这些有电话无人接的机关，是把举报电话当作应付上面检查的摆设。
    举报电话应包含有听记（随时有人接）、反映（尽快向主管部门说清）、速查（及时交办查实）、反馈（向举报人回报结果）等多个环节。少了其中哪道环节，举报电话都可能形同虚设。
    欺上蒙下的“花架子”，过去人们见得不少，腻歪透了。如今，要是再搞“花架子”就会使群众产生“逆反心理”，许多本来深得群众拥护的事也办不成。
