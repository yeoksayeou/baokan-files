The PLA delegation, consisting of representatives from the three main military departments and the South China Sea Fleet of the Navy, visited the South China Sea islands, specifically Yongshu Reef, on January 21. The reef is located over 700 nautical miles from the mainland.

The delegation, led by Deputy Political Commissar of the South China Sea Fleet, Major General Zhou Shaoxun, conveyed New Year greetings from the leaders of the General Staff, General Political Department, General Logistics Department, and the Navy, as well as the Hainan Provincial Government, to the military and civilians who guard and build the South China Sea islands day and night.

Despite the strong winds and high waves, the delegation braved the elements to deliver care packages to the high-stilt houses built on the reef. They also handed out sports and cultural equipment, as well as New Year goods, to the military and civilians.

Over the past few days, the delegation has visited various reefs in the South China Sea, including Huayang Reef, Chigua Reef, Dongmen Reef, Nanxun Reef, and Zhubi Reef. They also visited ships on patrol and transport duties in the South China Sea. The delegation thoroughly understood the living conditions of the officers and soldiers, and carefully listened to their suggestions and opinions on defending and building the South China Sea islands.
