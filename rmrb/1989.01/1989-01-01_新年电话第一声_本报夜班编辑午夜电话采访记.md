The first chime of the New Year had just sounded, and several night-shift editors at the People's Daily picked up their phones to begin interviews with comrades who were on duty at various posts. They were asked to share a few words, reflecting on the past year or expressing their hopes and aspirations for the new year.

Program Yongwang, duty room at Beijing Railway Station:
First, let me share some good news. The year 1988 has come to a successful conclusion for our station. In the new year, we will strive to improve our services, aiming to ensure that all passengers arrive with enthusiasm and depart with satisfaction.

Ouyang Jianzhen, switchboard at the All-China Women's Federation:
As a woman, I hope that society will pay more attention to children and provide them with more spiritual nourishment.

Xu Jianping, dispatch center at the Third Branch of Beijing Taxi Company:
We care about our image. Sometimes, customers blame us for not being able to get a taxi by phone, and we feel quite wronged. We will work to provide better service and more convenience for the citizens of Beijing.

Zheng Mingyi, duty room at the National Meteorological Administration:
Our meteorological department will strive to improve the accuracy of disaster weather forecasts, contributing to a bountiful agricultural harvest this year.

Yuan Libu, emergency repair department at Beijing Power Supply Bureau:
I'd like to comment on prices. Compared to before, they have risen too quickly. For someone like me with a family to support, elderly parents, and children, earning less and facing price increases is quite tough. Some people have complaints about price increases, and that is understandable.

Zhang Mingwei, complaint center at the Supervision Department:
I have worked in the information departments of the Central Office and the State Council for over 20 years and am very angry about the unwholesome trends. The establishment of the complaint center and hotline allows us to communicate directly with the people, broadening the channels of communication between the leadership and the masses. We have received many complaints and have handled them according to the specifics of each case.

The achievements of the past ten years of reform are significant, but the rapid rise in prices must be controlled. I hope that as prices rise, wages will also be adjusted accordingly.

Ren Jinlu, duty room at Beijing Fire Brigade:
Coincidentally, we just received the first fire alarm of the year.

In recent years, the number of fire alarms has decreased, but the losses caused by fires have increased. One reason is that fire-fighting equipment is outdated and vehicles are poorly equipped. Preventing fires is more important than preventing theft because fires are destructive.

A night-shift nurse at the Dongsi Maternity Hospital rest room:
We feel that the job of a nurse is very hard. We often work night shifts and can't spend holidays with our families, feeling guilty towards them. Those with children have it even harder, unable to take care of them properly. Some people in society do not understand or look down on us.

Nurses work hard, but their pay and benefits are low. If there is any appeal, it would be to improve the pay and bonuses. But this situation has been going on for many years, and even though they talk about improvements, not much has changed, so we don't think about it much anymore.

A woman who had just given birth by cesarean section in the rest room of Dongsi Maternity Hospital:
A young mother who had just undergone a cesarean section an hour before the New Year, still weak from the operation and unable to get out of bed. The reporter asked a nurse to convey her hopes for her child. The mother said: Of course, I hope my child will be successful and make something of themselves. But raising a child also brings additional worries, such as kindergarten and school enrollment, and future education. Now, in some places, children need to pay "sponsorship fees" to enroll in kindergarten and school, which is concerning.

...

Over the course of more than an hour, the editors made more than twenty phone calls, but in terms of representativeness, it was still not enough. There were also a few duty phones that were dialed but no one answered.

The phone calls conveyed the wishes of ordinary people.

　　新年电话第一声
    ——本报夜班编辑午夜电话采访记
    “喂，我是人民日报夜班编辑，在电话里向您祝贺新年啦……”
    新年的第一声钟声刚刚响过，本报几位值班编辑各自抓起电话，开始采访一些正坚守在各种岗位上的同志，请他们说一句自己想说的话，可以是对过去一年的回顾，也可以是对新的一年的祝愿和希冀……
    北京站值班室程永旺：
    先报告一个喜讯，刚刚过去的１９８８年，我站胜利完成了各项任务。新的一年里，我们要在服务上更上一层楼，力争让广大旅客乘兴而来、满意而归。
    全国妇联总机室欧阳珍珍：
    作为一名女同志，我希望全社会更多地关心儿童，为下一代提供更多的精神食粮。
    北京市出租汽车公司第三分公司总调度室许建平：
    我们关心自己的形象。有时顾客因电话叫不到车而指责我们，我们也挺委屈的。我们将以更优质的服务，为北京市民提供更多的方便。
    国家气象局值班室郑明一：
    我们气象部门要在灾害性天气预报方面力求更准确一些，为夺取今年农业生产丰收作出应有的贡献。
    北京市供电局急修处袁立书：
    说点对物价的看法，跟以前比，确实涨得太快。像我这样拉家带口的，上有老，下有小，挣钱少，涨价就有点受不了。对物价上涨，有些人有看法，是可以理解的。
    监察部举报中心张明维：
    我曾在中办、国办信访部门工作２０多年，对不正之风很气愤。设立举报中心和举报电话，可以和群众直接对话，拓宽了上下沟通的渠道。我们接到不少举报电话，根据案情分别做了处理。
    十年改革的成绩确实很大，但物价迅速上涨的势头必须控制住。希望物价上涨的同时，也能适当调整一下工资。
    北京火警值班室任金路：
    正巧，我们刚接到一个火警报告，是今年第一个火警。
    这几年，火警次数少了，但因火警造成的损失却增加了。其中一个原因是消防设备落后，车辆装备差。防火比防盗重要。因为火灾是毁灭性的。
    东四妇产医院休养室值班女护士：
    我们就觉得护士这项工作太辛苦了，经常值夜班，逢年过节的也没法跟家人团圆，觉得对不起家里人。有小孩的就更苦了，顾不上。社会上还有一些人不理解、瞧不起我们。
    护士工作辛苦，可工资待遇低。要说有什么呼吁，就希望能改善工资奖金待遇。可这种情况已经好多年了，老说改善也没改多少，也就不怎么想了。
    东四妇产医院休养室一位产妇：
    新年到来前一个多小时刚破腹产的一位年轻母亲，做完手术，身体虚弱，不能下床。本报编辑请护士代问她对孩子的希望。产妇说：当然希望自己的孩子将来有出息，有所作为。可养了孩子又平添了些许烦恼，如孩子的入托上学，将来的教育啦。现在有的地方小孩入托上学要交什么“赞助费”，令人担心。
    ……
    一个多小时里，几位编辑尽管打了二十多个电话，但就其代表性而言，尚嫌不够。也有个别值班电话拨通了，但没人接。
    电话声声，传来的是一些普通人的心愿。
