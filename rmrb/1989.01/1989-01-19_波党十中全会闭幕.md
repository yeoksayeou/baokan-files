The 10th Plenum of the Polish United Workers' Party concluded today after an all-night discussion and heated debate. According to a report by the Polish News Agency, the plenum unanimously adopted the resolution of the 10th Plenum and approved the "Central Committee's Position on Political Pluralism and Trade Union Pluralism" by a majority vote. The plenum thus came to an end.

After the full meeting concluded, the Central Committee held a vote of confidence in the party's highest leadership led by Jaruzelski. The vote passed with four abstentions. According to sources, this agenda item was not originally planned.

The contents of the two documents adopted by the Central Committee have not yet been released.

The second phase of the Central Committee meeting began on January 16. The agenda included summarizing the discussions following the first phase of the meeting on the Political Bureau's outline for party reform and adopting a resolution, as well as discussing and making appropriate decisions on political pluralism and trade union pluralism, particularly the conditional recognition of the Solidarity trade union. Due to differing opinions among the attendees on the issue of trade union pluralism, especially the legalization of Solidarity, the meeting postponed its closing time.

　　波党十中全会闭幕
    新华社华沙１月１８日电  据波通社今天报道，波兰统一工人党十中全会经过通宵的讨论和激烈辩论之后，于今天凌晨一致通过十中全会决议，并以多数票赞成《中央委员会关于政治多元化和工会多元化的立场》。全会至此宣告结束。
    全体会议结束后，中央委员会举行了对雅鲁泽尔斯基领导的党的最高当局的信任表决，在４人弃权的情况下获得通过。据此间人士透露，这项议程是原来所没有的。
    中央全会通过的上述两项文件的内容迄今尚未公布。
    中央全会第二阶段会议是１月１６日开始举行的。会议的议程为，总结第一阶段会议后全党讨论政治局关于党本身改革的提纲的情况并通过决议，同时就政治多元化和工会多元化，特别是有条件地承认团结工会问题展开讨论并作出相应的决定。由于与会者在工会多元化，特别是团结工会合法化问题上存在意见分歧，会议推迟了闭幕时间。
