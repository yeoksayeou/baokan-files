A parasitic weed known as witchweed is spreading rapidly in the Sahel region of Africa and the areas to its south, posing a significant threat to the region's food crops. This viral plant causes an estimated $7 billion in losses annually for 14 West African countries.

Currently, over 40 species of witchweed have been identified, with three being the most harmful. A single witchweed plant can produce between 40,000 and 100,000 seeds, which are carried by the wind and spread widely. Once the seeds germinate, they penetrate the roots of nearby plants, extracting water and nutrients until the host plant withers and dies.

This harmful weed was first discovered in the 18th century in Ireland, where it devastated large areas of potato crops, leading to widespread famine. It has since been found in other parts of the world. Over the years, organizations like the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization have conducted extensive research on witchweed, but an effective method to eradicate it has yet to be found.

　　“女巫草”危害非洲
    一种寄生的野草“女巫草”正在非洲萨赫勒及其以南地区蔓延，对该地区粮食作物造成极大威胁。这种病毒性植物每年给１４个西非国家带来的损失高达７０亿美元。
    目前发现的“女巫草”共有４０多种，其中３种危害最大。一棵“女巫草”可产籽４万至１０万粒，随风飘扬，四处传播。它的种子萌发后，便将根扎进附近植物的根部，并从那里吸取水分及养料，直到把“寄主”吸干死掉为止。
    这种毒草最早发现于１８世纪爱尔兰地区。它曾将那里的大片马铃薯毁掉，一时造成饥馑。后来又在世界其他地区发现过。多年来，联合国粮农组织等对此进行了大量研究，但至今仍未找到根除“女巫草”的有效办法。
