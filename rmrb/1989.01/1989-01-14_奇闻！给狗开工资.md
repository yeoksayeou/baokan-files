Strange News! Paying a Dog a Salary

Our city government has stipulated that units and residents in the urban and suburban areas of the city are not allowed to keep dogs. The daughter of Wang De Cun, the manager of the Recovery Company under the Commercial Bureau of the Luobei District of our city, kept a dog. To avoid inspections, in early 1988, he hid the dog inside the Recovery Company for half a year. During this period, Wang De Cun, using the excuse that the dog was a company guard to boost morale, demanded that the company pay the dog a monthly labor fee of 40 yuan. An accountant asked how to record this in the books. Wang said, "You figure it out." This accountant named the dog "Wang Chunsheng" and recorded it as a temporary worker. Wang De Cun received the "dog's salary" every month.

　　奇闻！给狗开工资
    我市政府规定：市城郊各单位、居民不许养狗。我市路北区商业局回收公司经理王德存的女儿养了一条狗，为了逃避检查，１９８８年初，他将狗藏在回收公司内达半年之久。在这期间，王德存以狗为公司值班人员壮胆为由，要公司每月为狗支付４０元劳务费。一位会计请示怎么下账？王说：“你想办法。”这位会计给狗起名“王春生”，作为临时工下账。王德存月月领取“狗工资”。
