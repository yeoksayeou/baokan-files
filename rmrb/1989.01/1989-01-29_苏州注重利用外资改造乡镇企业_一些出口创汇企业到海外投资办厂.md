Suzhou Focuses on Utilizing Foreign Investment to Upgrade Township Enterprises

Some Export-Earning Enterprises Invest Overseas to Establish Factories

A report from our correspondent Sun Jian: Suzhou City is steadfastly implementing the coastal economic development strategy, seizing opportunities in the process of rectifying the economic environment and order, and paying attention to attracting foreign investment. It is actively utilizing foreign capital to upgrade old enterprises and township enterprises, thus finding a successful path to solve the urgent need for technological upgrading and improvement of existing enterprises to enter the international market, while facing the prominent contradiction of domestic capital shortage.

Suzhou's township enterprises are thriving but urgently need upgrading. Among the 125 existing joint ventures, 88 are involved in upgrading old enterprises, of which 77 are township enterprises. Suzhou Elevator Factory is one of the largest elevator production factories in China, but its technology and equipment are outdated and urgently need upgrading. Recently, the factory has invested all its original assets in a joint venture with one of the world's largest elevator manufacturers, the Swiss Schindler Holding Ltd., and the Hong Kong Jardine Schindler Holding Ltd. It has introduced 3.2 million US dollars in foreign exchange for technological upgrading and will obtain the latest technological dynamics of elevators manufactured by the world-advanced Swiss Schindler Company. In eight years, the export volume will reach more than 50% of the total production. Since last year, Zhangjiagang City's Xizhang Town has utilized foreign capital to upgrade five township enterprises, and three of them have already started production. Establishing a joint venture not only introduces foreign capital, advanced technology, and management experience, but also makes each joint venture an export-earning base, import-export channel, and a window for external economic exchanges.

While attracting foreign capital to upgrade old enterprises, investing overseas to establish factories has also attracted the attention of some enterprises in Suzhou, especially export-earning enterprises. Among the four overseas investment projects approved last year, there are not only those that invest abroad in the form of partnership and joint ventures, but also those that independently seek foreign partners to invest abroad; not only those that are generally of the assembly and processing type, but also those that are of the advanced type in microelectronics high technology; the regional distribution is not limited to Southeast Asia and other developing countries, but also includes entering developed countries such as the United States. Due to the realization of multiple ports, multiple forms, and multiple channels for exports throughout the city and countryside, the foreign trade procurement amount last year reached 3.38 billion yuan, accounting for 21.5% of the city's total national income, an increase of 70% over the previous year, ranking first among the prefecture-level cities in Jiangsu Province.

　　苏州注重利用外资改造乡镇企业    
    一些出口创汇企业到海外投资办厂
    本报讯  记者孙健报道：苏州市坚定不移地实施沿海经济发展战略，在整治经济环境和秩序中抓住机遇，注重吸引外商来投资，积极利用外资改造老企业，改造乡镇企业，从而找到了一条解决现有企业走向国际市场急需技术改造、提高水平，而国内资金短缺这一突出矛盾的成功之路。
    苏州市乡镇企业兴旺发达，但急需改造提高。在已有的１２５家三资企业中，有８８家是结合改造老企业的，其中有７７家是乡镇企业。苏州电梯厂是国内较大的生产电梯的专业工厂，但技术设备落后，急需改造。最近该厂将原有财产全部作价投资，同世界最大的电梯厂商之一瑞士迅达控股有限公司以及香港怡和与迅达控股有限公司合资，引进现汇３２０万美元进行技术改造，并将得到具有世界先进水平的瑞士迅达公司制造电梯的最新技术动态，８年内出口量将达到总产的５０％以上。张家港市西张镇去年以来已利用外资改造了５个乡镇企业，目前已有３个投产。举办一个合资企业，不仅引进了国外资金、先进技术和管理经验，而且每一个合资企业都是出口创汇基地、进出口渠道和对外经济交往的窗口。
    在吸引外资改造老企业的同时，到海外投资办厂也已引起苏州市一些企业、特别是出口创汇企业的关注。在去年已批准的４家海外办企业中，不仅有以合伙集资参股形式向外投资的，也有自行寻找国外伙伴单独向外投资的；不仅有散件组装加工技术一般型的，也有微电子高技术先进型的；地区分布也不局限于东南亚等发展中国家，也有进入美国等发达国家的。由于全市城乡实现多口岸、多形式、多渠道出口，去年外贸收购额达到３３．８亿元，占全市国民生产总值的２１．５％，比上年增长７０％，居江苏省省辖市的第一位。
