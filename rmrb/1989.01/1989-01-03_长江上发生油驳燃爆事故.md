Today at dawn, an oil barge ran aground and subsequently caught fire and exploded in the Yangtze River near Xintankou, 81 kilometers upstream from Hankou, within the jurisdiction of Honghu City. As a result, navigation on this section of the Yangtze River has been suspended.

According to reports, at 1:15 AM, the Nanjing Yangtze Oil Transportation Company's Yangtze 62008 fleet ran aground and broke loose. The oil barges 63023 and 63040, each carrying 4800 tons of crude oil, caught fire. Barge 63023 burned from Xintankou all the way to Daxingzhou, while barge 63040 drifted to the mouth of Panzhou, where it ran aground and anchored. It then experienced two small explosions at 8:57 AM and 8:59 AM, causing oil fires to spread across the river surface.

Following the accident, the general manager and party secretary of the Ministry of Communications' Yangtze River Steamship Company, along with officials from the Yangtze River Navigation Administration, rushed to the scene to organize rescue efforts.

The cause of the accident is still under investigation.
