Let Us Cheer Together for Sino-French Relations
— Interview with Michel Malle, New French Ambassador to China

Reporters:  Zhū Hè from Beijing Daily,  Lǐ Guóqìng from Guangming Daily, and  Zhāng Qǐhuá from this newspaper

Today marks the 25th anniversary of the formal establishment of diplomatic relations between China and France. On the eve of this anniversary, we interviewed Michel Malle in Paris. Malle, who has previously served as the French Ambassador to China, will soon return to China to take up his post again. He shared with us his views and ideas on developing friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries.

As early as 1945, Malle visited China as a student. In 1947, he joined the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. During his 42-year diplomatic career, more than one-third of his time was spent in China. Therefore, when Malle talks about Sino-French relations, we feel a sense of familiarity and authenticity.

Malle first reviewed the development of relations between the two countries since the establishment of diplomatic ties. He said that the relationship between the two countries has developed normally since the establishment of diplomatic relations. There was a pause during the Cultural Revolution, but later, with the mutual visits and increased exchanges between the leaders of the two countries, the relationship gradually developed and achieved many results. After China implemented its policy of opening up and modernization, the relationship between the two countries developed even more rapidly. Malle believes that the positions of China and France on major international issues are very close. Economic and trade, as well as cultural relations, have also seen significant development. France has good cooperation with China in the fields of transportation, postal and telecommunications, energy, and chemical engineering. However, he also frankly pointed out that compared to the good political relations, the economic and cultural relations between France and China are still not sufficiently developed. Both sides need to make efforts to bring them to a level commensurate with political relations.

Malle told us that Sino-French trade has increased in recent years, but compared to competitors from Japan, the United States, West Germany, Italy, and other countries, France's trade with China has increased more slowly. Therefore, France should make special efforts, and French enterprises should have more contact with China. They should also go to the provinces of China to study the other party's suggestions as well as issues related to price and funding.

The French government has already decided to make greater efforts to provide good financial conditions for French enterprises abroad, especially in China. He believes that transportation, telecommunications, energy, and other sectors are important areas for China's economic development, and France has advantages in these sectors. Therefore, for French enterprises interested in the Chinese market, there are many things that can be done, and the prospects are broad. We should be hopeful about this.

When discussing the issue of cultural and technological relations between France and China, Malle believes that to promote exchanges, language teaching should be developed. He said that the number of exchange students on both sides is gradually increasing; China has opened television French classes; France is also developing Chinese language teaching. In the past, Chinese was only taught at the Paris Institute of Oriental Languages, but now many secondary schools in provinces outside Paris have also set up Chinese language courses. He also introduced to us the situation of cultural and artistic exchanges between the two countries in recent years.

Malle told us that after taking up his post, he will strengthen contacts with relevant departments in China to make political dialogue more intimate and to make economic, trade, cultural, and technological exchanges more extensive. In terms of economic and trade relations, on the one hand, he will promote the negotiation of large-scale project contracts, and on the other hand, he will establish service agencies in China for French small and medium-sized enterprises to carry out economic and trade activities. Cooperation in the field of science and technology will also be further developed.

Malle is very happy to return to China for his second term. He said with deep emotion that he and his wife have always been deeply interested in China and Chinese civilization. Each stage of his life has been related to China, and China is like his "second homeland." He believes that both sides should work together to develop the friendly relations between the two countries. It was time to say goodbye, and Malle made a strong gesture, saying in Chinese: "Let us cheer together!"

　　让我们共同为中法关系加油    
    ——访法国新任驻华大使马洛先生

    今天是中法两国正式建交２５周年。在这个纪念日前夕，我们在巴黎采访了米歇尔·马洛先生。马洛先生曾任法国驻华大使，不久又将去中国出任大使。他同我们畅谈了他对发展中法两国友好合作关系的看法和设想。
    早在１９４５年，马洛先生就以学生身份到过中国。他于１９４７年进入法国外交部。在４２年的外交生涯中，有１／３多的时间是在中国度过的。所以，听马洛先生谈中法关系，我们感到亲切、实在。
    马洛先生首先回顾了两国建交以来关系的发展情况。他说，双方关系自建交以来得到了正常发展。文化革命中间有过停顿，后来随着两国领导人互访及交往增多，关系又逐渐发展并取得不少成果。中国实行开放和现代化政策后，两国关系发展更为迅速。马洛先生认为，中法在重大国际问题上的立场十分接近。经贸和文化关系也有重要的发展。法国在交通运输、邮电通讯、能源及化工方面与中国有良好的合作。不过，他也坦率地指出，与良好的政治关系相比，法中两国的经济、文化关系的发展还不够，双方都需要作出努力，使之达到与政治关系相应的水平。
    马洛先生告诉我们，中法贸易近几年有所增加，但与日本、美国、联邦德国、意大利等外国竞争者相比，法国对华贸易增加较慢，因此，法国应特别作出努力，法国企业应与中国更多地接触，还应到中国的省里去，研究对方的建议以及价格、资金等问题。
    法国政府现已决定作出更大努力，为法国在外国、特别是在中国的企业提供良好的财政条件。他认为，交通、电信、能源等都是中国经济发展的重要领域，而法国在这些部门具有优势。因此对于关心中国市场的法国企业来说，可以做的事情很多，前景是广阔的，我们对此应抱有希望。
    谈及法中文化和科技关系问题时，马洛先生认为，要促进交往，就要发展语言教学。他说，现在双方留学人员名额逐步增加；中国开设了电视法语讲座；法国也在发展汉语教学，过去只有在巴黎东方语言学院教授汉语，现在外省许多城市的中学都设了汉语课。他还向我们介绍了近年来两国文化艺术交流的情况。
    马洛先生告诉我们，他到任后将与中国有关部门加强接触，使政治对话更加紧密，经贸、文化、科技交流更为广泛。在经贸关系方面，一方面要推动大型项目合同的谈判，另一方面要为法国中小企业建立在华开展经贸活动的服务机构。科技领域的合作也将进一步发展。
    马洛先生对他再次出使中国感到十分高兴。他深情地说，他和妻子一样，几十年来始终对中国和中国的文明抱有浓厚的兴趣。他生活的各个阶段几乎都与中国有关，中国就像是他的“第二祖国”。他认为，双方应该共同努力，使两国的友好关系得到更大的发展。告辞的时间到了，马洛先生做了一个有力的手势，用中文说道：“让我们一起加油！”
