The main tasks of the Soviet Union's political system reform in 1989 are to elect a new highest national authority, improve relations between the central government and the union republics, and reorganize local governments.

The newspaper "Moscow News" published the tight schedule for the election of people's representatives in its first issue of this year: from December 26, 1988, to January 24, 1989, candidates for people's representatives will be nominated; from January 25 to February 22, each electoral district will discuss and decide on the list of candidates; from January 26 to March 24, candidates will meet with voters; on March 26, more than 2,000 Soviet people's representatives will be elected nationwide.

The Soviet leadership has announced that the first session of the Congress of People's Deputies (the new highest national authority) will be convened on April 15, and a new highest permanent authority—the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, consisting of 400-450 people—will be elected. The Congress of People's Deputies will also elect the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR (the head of state), whose term of office is 5 years, not exceeding two terms.

Improving relations between the central government and the union republics is the second task of the political system reform. The Soviet Union currently has 15 union republics. Due to the implementation of a highly centralized system, some republics have opposed the excessive interference of central ministries and commissions in recent years, demanding expanded political and economic rights to facilitate their economic and social development. Additionally, in some union republics, national conflicts have become public. For this reason, the Central Committee of the CPSU decided to hold a plenary meeting in June to discuss relations between the central government and the union republics as well as national issues.

After the June plenary meeting, each union republic, territory, province, city, and district will elect local people's representatives and reorganize local governments. The new local authorities will begin work in December of this year. According to the resolution of the 19th CPSU Conference in July 1988, it is proposed that the first secretary of each level of party committee should concurrently serve as the chairman of the same level of Soviet. Some Soviet people do not agree with this concurrent appointment, while others hold a "let's try it" attitude. How the new highest national authority and local governments will truly implement the separation of party and government and democratic centralism is an important issue in the political system reform.

A political commentary by TASS says that the Soviet Union's political system reform has "entered a decisive stage" this year.

### 苏联拟定政治体制改革日程

　　苏联拟定政治体制改革日程
    ●选举新的国家最高权力机构
    ●改善中央与加盟共和国关系
    ●各加盟共和国改组地方政权
    新华社莫斯科１月４日电　１９８９年苏联政治体制改革的主要任务是选举新的国家最高权力机构、改善中央与各加盟共和国之间的关系，以及改组地方政权。
    《莫斯科新闻》周报今年第一期公布了苏联人民代表选举活动的紧张时间表：从１９８８年１２月２６日到１９８９年１月２４日，进行人民代表候选人提名；１月２５日到２月２２日，各选区讨论并决定候选人名单；１月２６日到３月２４日，候选人与选民会见；３月２６日全国各地投票选举出２０００多名苏联人民代表。
    苏联领导已经宣布，４月１５日将召开第一届人民代表大会（新的最高国家权力机构），选举新的最高的常设权力机构——由４００—４５０人组成的苏联最高苏维埃。人民代表大会还将选举苏联最高苏维埃主席（国家元首），主席任期５年，最多不超过两届。
    改善中央与加盟共和国之间的关系是苏联政治体制改革的第二项任务。苏联现有１５个加盟共和国，由于实行高度的中央集权制，一些共和国近年来反对中央部委的过多干涉，要求扩大共和国的政治和经济权利，以利于它们的经济和社会发展。另外，在某些加盟共和国民族矛盾公开化。为此，苏共中央决定在今年６月召开全会，讨论中央与加盟共和国的关系以及民族问题。
    ６月全会以后，各加盟共和国、边疆区、州、市和区将选举地方人民代表，改组地方政权。新的地方权力机构将在今年１２月开始工作。根据１９８８年７月苏共第１９次代表会议的决议，将推荐各级党委第一书记兼任同级苏维埃主席。部分苏联人不赞成这种兼任的做法，有些人则抱着“试试看”的想法。新的最高国家权力机构和地方政权将如何真正实行党政分权和民主集中制，是政治体制改革的一个重要课题。
    塔斯社的一篇政治评论说，苏联政治体制改革今年“进入一个决定阶段”。
