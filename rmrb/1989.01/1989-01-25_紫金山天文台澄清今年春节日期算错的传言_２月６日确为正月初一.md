The Purple Mountain Observatory Clarifies the Misconception About the Date of the Spring Festival This Year
February 6th is Confirmed as the First Day of the Lunar New Year

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, January 24th (Reporter Xu Jiling) In response to the recent misinformation circulating in Hong Kong, Macau, Guangzhou, Beijing, and other cities that the date of the Spring Festival this year is not February 6th but February 7th, the authoritative institution in China for compiling calendars—the Purple Mountain Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences—held a press conference today. Director Tong Fu, a researcher, clarified the matter.

Tong Fu explained that the first day of the lunar New Year is the traditional festival of the Chinese people—the Spring Festival. According to the lunar calendar, when the sun and the moon are in the same position during their orbits, it marks the beginning of a month, known as "merging shadows." This day is the first day of the month. Astronomers who study calendar calculations, through scientific observation and precise calculation of the positions of the sun and the moon, have determined that the merging shadows time for the first month of the lunar year of Jisi (己巳年) is at 15:37 Beijing time on February 6, 1989. Therefore, February 6th should be the first day of the lunar New Year.

He pointed out that the reason some regions have spread the misconception that the Spring Festival this year is not on February 6th is because some calendars are based on the "Eternal Calendar" compiled during the Qing Dynasty. Due to the limitations of its calculation methods, it is not very accurate and thus cannot be used as a basis for compiling calendars.

### 紫金山天文台澄清今年春节日期算错的传言  ２月６日确为正月初一

　　紫金山天文台澄清今年春节日期算错的传言    
    ２月６日确为正月初一
    新华社南京１月２４日电（记者徐机玲）针对最近在港澳地区和广州、北京等城市流传的今年春节日期不是２月６日，而是２月７日的错误传言，我国编算历书的权威机构——中国科学院紫金山天文台今天召开新闻发布会，台长童傅研究员对此事作了澄清。
    童傅介绍说，农历正月初一是我国人民的传统佳节——春节。根据农历历法，当太阳和月亮在运行中达到同一方位时，为一月之首，称“合朔”，这一天即为每月初一。从事历算研究的天文学家经过对太阳、月亮运行位置的科学观测和精确计算，确定农历己巳年正月合朔时刻在１９８９年２月６日北京时间１５时３７分，因此，２月６日应为正月初一。
    他指出，之所以一些地区流传今年春节日期不是２月６日的说法，是因为有的日历是根据清朝编制的《万年历》印制的，由于其计算方法的局限，不很准确，故不可作为编制日历的依据。
