Various types of consumer goods are in high demand, driving up prices due to a buying frenzy. Last year, China's total retail sales of consumer goods saw an exceptional increase, exceeding 740 billion yuan, a 27.8% increase from the previous year.

According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the market in China saw rapid development in 1988. The total retail sales of social consumer goods nationwide exceeded 740 billion yuan, with an estimated 27.8% increase from the previous year. This is the highest growth rate since the founding of the People's Republic.

The significant feature of last year's retail market was the exceptional growth in sales of various consumer goods. Clothing and daily necessities saw a full-scale boom, with sales of clothing and daily necessities estimated to have increased by 31.3% and 21.4% respectively compared to the previous year. Major commodity sales volumes compared to the previous year showed that black-and-white televisions and color televisions increased by 33.2% and 17% respectively, while cotton fabrics, woolen fabrics, silk, and various types of clothing all saw growth rates of over 10%. Electric fans, washing machines, and tape recorders, which had been sluggish in the previous two years, saw strong sales growth, with increases ranging from 18% to 36%. The sales of the "three major items" — sewing machines, watches, and bicycles — also shifted from stagnation to brisk sales. The supply of food was generally stable, with the exception of pork and sugar, other food sales volumes all saw varying degrees of increase.

It is reported that last year, China's total retail sales of social consumer goods followed a parabolic growth pattern, with monthly growth rates varying by as much as 19.3 percentage points, indicating significant market fluctuations. The buying frenzy caused many commodities to see a surge in sales, driving up prices and disrupting normal market order. Commercial enterprises, misled by erroneous market signals, engaged in blind purchasing and production, leading to false consumption and facing the danger of new accumulations.

The National Bureau of Statistics pointed out that to maintain the market's prosperity and stability this year, it is necessary to firmly control prices, strengthen price supervision and management, and severely punish various "speculators." At the same time, it is crucial to continue reducing the purchasing power of social groups and control the rapid growth of consumption funds. Additionally, it is essential to effectively manage the procurement of agricultural and sideline products and organize the production of daily necessities and short-supply light textile products.

　　各类消费品需求过旺　抢购风拉动物价上涨
    去年我国商品零售总额超常增长
    总额超过７４００亿元比前年增长２７．８％
    新华社北京１月８日电  （记者吴士深、通讯员童茂）据国家统计局统计，我国市场过旺发展，１９８８年全国社会商品零售总额超过７４００亿元，预计比上年增长２７．８％，是建国以来增长速度最高的年份。
    各类消费品销售超常增长，是去年零售市场的显著特点。穿用商品全面旺销，用的商品和穿的商品零售额预计分别比上年增长３１．３％和２１．４％。主要商品零售量与上年相比，黑白电视机、彩电分别增长３３．２％和１７％，棉布、呢绒、绸缎和各种服装增长幅度均在１０％以上。电风扇、洗衣机、录音机一反前两年疲软状态，销售呈强劲增长之势，增长幅度１８％至３６％。“老三大件”——缝纫机、手表、自行车销售也由滞变畅。吃的商品供应基本平稳，除猪肉、食糖外，其他食品零售量均有不同程度的上升。
    据介绍，去年我国社会商品零售总额呈抛物线型增长，月份之间增长幅度高低相差１９．３个百分点，市场波动程度很大。商品抢购风使多数商品销售激增，拉动物价上涨，使正常的市场秩序发生紊乱。工商企业受错误的市场导向，盲目采购和生产，造成虚假的消费，面临新的积压的危险。
    国家统计局指出，要保持今年市场的繁荣与稳定，既要坚决稳住物价，加强物价监督和管理，从严惩治各种“倒爷”，又要继续压缩社会集团购买力，控制消费基金的过快增长。同时，切实抓好农副产品收购，组织好日用品和短线轻纺产品的生产。
