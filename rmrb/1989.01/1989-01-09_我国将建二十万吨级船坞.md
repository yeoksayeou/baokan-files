China's largest shipyard project—the 200,000-ton shipyard at Dalian Shipyard—opened its bidding today in Dalian Shipyard. The Navy Construction Engineering Department, the First Maritime Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, and the Great Bridge Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways unveiled the bids.

This shipyard project is a key project during China's Seventh Five-Year Plan. It will be designed and constructed entirely by China. According to the plan and design, the shipyard will be 365 meters long, 80 meters wide, and 12.7 meters deep, with a 900-ton large gantry crane and a 400-meter-long berthing quay. The total cost is approximately 200 million yuan. Construction will commence in March of this year, with completion scheduled for April 1992.

It is understood that currently, the international shipping industry has an increased demand for large-tonnage ships. However, China only has Dalian Shipyard capable of building ships around 100,000 tons, and it is not yet able to build 200,000-ton to 300,000-ton super-large ships. The construction of this shipyard will enhance China's shipbuilding industry's competitiveness in the international market.

　　我国将建二十万吨级船坞
    新华社大连１月８日电  （记者李小林）我国最大的船坞工程——大连造船厂２０万吨级船坞工程今天在大连造船厂开标。海军建设工程部、交通部第一航务工程局、铁道部大桥工程局揭标。
    这项船坞工程是我国“七五”期间重点工程，它将由我国自行设计、自行建造。根据规划和设计，这个船坞长３６５米、宽８０米、深１２．７米，还有９００吨大型龙门吊车和４００米长的系泊码头，总造价约２亿元人民币。工程将于今年３月破土动工，预计１９９２年４月竣工。
    据了解，目前国际航运界对大吨位船舶需求增加，可是我国只有大连造船厂一家船厂能建造１０万吨级左右的船舶，２０万吨级至３０万吨级超大型船舶尚不能建造。这个船坞的建设，有利于增强我国造船工业在国际市场上的竞争能力。
