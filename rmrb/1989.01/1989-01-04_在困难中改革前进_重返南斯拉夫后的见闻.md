What exactly has changed in Yugoslavia? This was the question that most concerned me when I returned to Belgrade after two years. To find the answer, I wandered through the main commercial districts of Belgrade and drove through the remote alleys I had previously visited. Everywhere, I saw signs of progress in the capital: many important streets have been renovated, cars with license plates from all over the country and Europe flow in all directions along prominent road signs, public places like Marx and Engels Square and Republic Square have been transformed, new street gardens and fountains add charm to the city, and new residential areas have emerged on formerly desolate land. The old city's narrow streets are now adorned with new buildings, giving the area a fresh look. Whether in a large department store that stocks over ten thousand items or in a small private shop, everything is available and the stores are bustling. Most shops have open shelves, allowing residents to browse and freely choose their New Year's goods or other items. In the evenings, almost all stores remain brightly lit. All of this makes every newcomer marvel at the market's prosperity, the abundance of goods, and the orderly social order!

However, if you open the local newspapers and watch television or listen to the radio, you will see or hear warnings about the worsening economic situation and calls for unity and struggle. They point out that Yugoslavia is in the midst of a serious economic crisis, the most prominent manifestation of which is uncontrollable inflation and currency devaluation. The first thing I felt I needed to change after arriving in Belgrade was my understanding of the denomination of Yugoslav currency. In the past, buying a newspaper cost less than 100 dinars, but now it costs 1000 dinars. In the past, the prices of goods were generally calculated in thousands or tens of thousands of dinars, but now they easily reach tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of dinars. According to materials published by the *Borba* newspaper, two years ago 50,000 dinars were worth 105 dollars, but now they are worth only about 10 dollars. The average annual inflation rate from 1981 to 1986 was 56.3%, and in 1987 it was over 176%, with estimates that it will exceed 300% this year. In recent days, the media have been announcing that gasoline prices will soon rise by 17%, electricity by 70%, and food oils, milk, and bread will also see price increases. Inflation has already had a significant impact on the lives of Yugoslav residents. For example, most families own a car, but now many cars are parked on the side of the road for long periods or are driven very little because the owners cannot afford the fuel costs; in the past, many families went to the seaside for vacation every year, but now they can't; in the past, every meal included a lot of meat, but now there are months when they can't eat meat at all... According to sociologists, the living standards of Yugoslav residents have now fallen to the level of 1976.

The serious economic crisis is also evident in the overall stagnation and decline of social production, with most projects failing to meet their planned targets; nearly 1/8 of business units are operating at a loss due to poor economic conditions and mismanagement, relying on loans and even social funds to maintain wage payments; despite using 40% of foreign exchange earnings to repay principal and interest each year, the 200 billion dollar foreign debt has not decreased, and the amount of domestic arrears between enterprises and banks is the same as the foreign debt, with the total internal and external debt reaching 1/3 of the social total output; the number of unemployed is also increasing.

If we count from the so-called "year of economic stability" in 1979, Yugoslavia has been fighting economic difficulties for 10 years. They have successively formulated the "Anti-Inflation Program," the "Long-Term Economic Stabilization Program," and other series of policies and guidelines, but none have been effective. Under the principle of autonomy, the federation has delegated many powers for managing the social economy, including the power to expand reproduction, to the six republics and two autonomous provinces, causing the "power" of these entities to expand, and gradually forming 8 "power centers," 8 "closed" markets, 8 independent power systems, tax systems, and railway transportation systems in Yugoslavia. They are divided from each other, self-sufficient, and each formulates its own social, political, and economic laws. For the sake of local interests and vested positions, they "discuss but do not decide" on issues involving the overall interests of the federation, or "commands are not followed" and "prohibitions are not enforced." It is precisely this "multi-center state authoritarianism" that has exacerbated all kinds of contradictions in Yugoslavia, leading to a social and economic crisis, and making all efforts to fight difficulties come to naught. From this, leaders such as the Chairman of the Presidency of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, Šuvar, have concluded that Yugoslavia's past reforms have not been successful, and the only way to overcome the current crisis is to resolutely carry out economic reform, political system reform, and reform of the League of Communists. The May 1988 Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia set the course for these three reforms, and the Federal Constitutional Amendment passed on October 22 provided legal guarantees for their implementation. Specific reform plans are currently being studied and formulated.

Whether these three reforms will be successful and whether Yugoslavia can thereby extricate itself from the current serious social, economic, and political situation, local public opinion believes that this is the biggest challenge facing the entire party and the people of Yugoslavia since 1948. We wish them success in this battle for the future of the nation, achieving another historic victory.

　　在困难中改革前进
    ——重返南斯拉夫后的见闻
    本报记者  严正
    南斯拉夫究竟发生了什么变化？这是我离别２年后重返贝尔格莱德时最为关心的问题。为了寻找答案，我徜徉在贝尔格莱德的主要商业区，也驱车重访了曾经到过的偏僻小巷，到处可见这个首都前进的足迹：许多重要街道都已经修缮过，挂着全国各地和欧洲各国牌照的汽车沿着醒目的路标潮水般流向四面八方，马恩广场、共和国广场等公共场所都已面貌一新，新建的街心花园、喷泉池千姿百态，使城市平添魅力，在昔日荒凉的地段上又出现了一片片新的生活区，老城狭窄的街道上矗立的新建筑使这里也旧貌换新颜。无论在经营十多万种商品的大百货公司里，还是私人小铺里，都百货俱全，满堂生辉。大部分商店开架供应，任居民穿行其间，自由选择年货或其它物品，到了晚间，几乎所有商店彻夜灯光明亮。这一切使每个初来的客人都会为它市场的繁荣、商品的丰富和社会秩序的有条不紊发出赞叹！
    然而，打开这里的报纸和电视、广播，每天都能看到或听到警告经济状况还在恶化、要求大家团结战斗的讲话和文章。他们指出，南斯拉夫正处于严重的经济危机之中，最突出的表现是难以抑制的通货膨胀和货币贬值。我来到贝尔格莱德后感到的第一个需要改变的观念是南斯拉夫货币的计量数字。过去买一份报纸不到１００第纳尔，现在需付１０００第纳尔。过去商品的价格一般以千第纳尔、万第纳尔计算，现在动不动就是几十万甚至上百万第纳尔。据《战斗报》公布的材料，２年前５万第纳尔值１０５美元，现在只值１０多美元了。１９８１—１９８６年５年间的年均通货膨胀率为５６．３％，１９８７年为１７６％多，估计今年将突破３００％。这几天新闻媒介已在预告，不久汽油又将涨价１７％，电费涨７０％，食油、牛奶、面包也将随着涨价，通货膨胀已使南斯拉夫居民的生活受到不少影响。例如这里大部分家庭都有小汽车，但现在许多小车长期停在马路边不开或开得很少，因为车主承受不了汽油开支；过去许多家庭年年要去海边度假，现在不能去了；过去每餐必有大肉，现在有一个月也吃不上肉的时候了……据社会学家估计，南斯拉夫居民目前的生活已下降到１９７６年的水平。
    严重的经济危机还表现在整个社会生产从停滞状况开始趋向下降，除个别项目外，大部分未完成计划指标；将近１／８的企业单位因经济条件恶化和经营不善而亏损，靠贷款甚至动用社会资金维持工资开支；尽管每年用４０％的外汇收入还本付息，２００亿美元的外债并未减少，国内企业间以及企业对银行的各种拖欠与外债数相同，内外债总额达到社会总产值的１／３；失业人数也有增加。
    如果从称为“稳定经济的１９７９年”算起，今年南斯拉夫已与经济困难斗争了１０个年头。他们先后制定了“反通货膨胀纲领”、“经济稳定长期纲领”和其它一系列方针政策，但都未见成效。在自治的原则下，联邦把管理社会经济的许多权力，包括扩大再生产的权力下放了，使６个共和国和两个自治省的“权力膨胀了”，在南斯拉夫的土地上逐渐形成了８个“权力中心”，８个“封闭性”的市场，８个独立的动力系统、税收系统和铁路运输系统。它们彼此分割，自成一体，各自制定社会、政治、经济法令，为了局部利益和既得地位，对涉及联邦整体利益的问题“议而不决”，或者“令不行”、“禁不止”。正是这种“多中心的国家集权主义”使南斯拉夫的各种矛盾加剧，社会经济陷入困境，所有与困难作斗争的努力付诸东流。南斯拉夫共盟主席团主席舒瓦尔等领导同志由此作出结论：南斯拉夫过去的改革并没有获得成功，克服目前危机的唯一出路是毫不犹豫地重新进行经济改革、政治体制改革和共盟改革。去年５月举行的南共盟代表大会为这３项改革确定了路线，１０月２２日通过联邦宪法修正案，又为改革的实施作出了法律保障。目前正在研究制订具体的改革方案。
    上述３项改革能否成功，南斯拉夫能否由此摆脱目前严重的社会、经济和政治局势，此间舆论认为，这是南斯拉夫全党和全国人民所面临的自１９４８年以来最大的挑战。祝愿他们在这场涉及国家前途的战斗中，再一次取得具有历史意义的胜利。
