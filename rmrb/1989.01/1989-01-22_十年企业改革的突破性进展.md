The December 1988 issue of the journal "Enterprise Management" published an article from the Enterprise System Reform Office of the State Commission for Restructuring the Economic System. The article states that over the past decade, China's economic system reform has focused on revitalizing enterprises and enhancing their vitality. A series of major policy measures have been implemented, leading to significant breakthroughs in enterprise reform. The main aspects are as follows:

	1. Enterprises have gained some degree of autonomy in planning. The number of products under mandatory state planning has decreased from over 120 to around 60. The number of materials allocated by the state has reduced from 256 to 26. Enterprises now have more flexibility in arranging production and have some authority to sell their products independently.

	2. The leadership system of enterprises has been reformed. Over 68% of state-owned industrial enterprises have adopted the factory director responsibility system, addressing issues of no one being responsible, no authority to be responsible, and no way to be responsible. This has changed the previous situation where party and government functions were not clearly separated within enterprises.

	3. Enterprises have gained more authority in internal distribution. Various forms of wage systems linked to economic performance have been implemented, and the internal economic responsibility system of enterprises has been continuously improved, tightening the connection between rights, responsibilities, and benefits.

	4. Enterprises have more control over financial resources. Retained profits of enterprises have been increasing year by year, and enterprises can invest externally through joint ventures, cooperative ventures, and compensatory trade.

	5. Various forms of management have been piloted. The contract responsibility system has been widely promoted, along with various forms of inter-enterprise contracting, mergers, asset management responsibility system, enterprise leasing, and shareholding. Especially with the introduction of the competition mechanism into contracting, enterprises have started to adopt bidding, hiring managers, appointing cadres, and optimizing labor combinations. The principles of "positions through competition, income through contribution" are being increasingly recognized.

	6. Technological progress in enterprises has been rapid. Enterprises have utilized their own funds and state loans to introduce advanced technologies and carry out technological transformations. From 1981 to 1987, state-owned industrial enterprises completed 297,000 technological transformation projects, adding 213.1 billion yuan in fixed assets, equivalent to 34.7% of the fixed assets of state-owned enterprises in 1980.

	7. Horizontal integration of enterprises has seen new developments. A number of national, cross-regional, and cross-industry enterprise economic alliances have been formed. There are nearly 1,000 large enterprise groups.

	8. Efforts to improve product quality, reduce material consumption, enhance economic benefits, and ensure safe production have been launched. Over 1,230 enterprises have been upgraded to second-class national enterprises.

	9. Extensive training programs have been conducted to cultivate a group of enterprise leaders who are committed to reform and innovation.

	10. A series of economic regulations, including the "Enterprise Law," "Bankruptcy Law," "Enterprise Contracting Regulations," and "Enterprise Leasing Regulations," have been issued, guiding China's enterprise system reform onto a legal track.

　　十年企业改革的突破性进展
    １９８８年第１２期《企业管理》刊登国家体改委企业体制司的文章说，十年来，我国经济体制改革坚持以搞活企业、增强企业活力为中心环节，采取了一系列重大政策措施，企业改革有了突破性的进展。主要表现在以下几个方面：
    一、企业有了一定的计划自主权。国家指令性计划减少，国家直接管理的工业产品从１２０多种减少到６０多种，统一分配的物资从２５６种减少到２６种；企业自行安排生产的余地大了，有了一定的产品自销权。
    二、对企业领导体制进行了改革。６８％以上的国有工业企业推行厂长负责制，克服了企业生产经营中无人负责，无权负责，无法负责的现象，改变了过去企业中党政不分的状况。
    三、企业内部分配权有所增加。实行了多种形式的工资总额同经济效益挂钩的办法，企业内部经济责任制不断完善，责权利结合紧密了。
    四、企业支配财力的权力有所增多。企业留利逐年增加，企业可以通过合营、联营、补偿贸易等形式，向企业外部投资。
    五、进行了多种经营形式试点。普遍推行了承包经营责任制，以及多种形式的企业间承包、企业间兼并，以及资产经营责任制、企业租赁、股份制等。特别是把竞争机制引入承包后，企业实行招标，招聘经营者、聘任干部、推行劳动优化组合，“岗位靠竞争，收入靠贡献”开始为越来越多的人所认识。
    六、企业技术进步进展较快，企业利用自有资金和国家贷款，引进先进技术，进行技术改造。国有工业企业从１９８１年到１９８７年累计完成技术改造项目２９．７万个，新增固定资产２１３１亿元，相当于１９８０年国有企业固定资产的３４．７％。
    七、企业横向联合有了新的发展。形成了一批全国性、跨地区、跨行业的企业经济联合体。大型企业集团已近１０００个。
    八、以提高产品质量，降低物资消耗，提高经济效益，保证安全生产作为主要内容的抓管理、上等级、全面提高企业素质的工作已经展开。有１２３０多个企业升格为国家二级企业。
    九、广泛开展人才培训，培养锻炼了一批坚持改革、勇于开拓的企业领导干部。
    十、颁布了《企业法》、《破产法》、《企业承包条例》、《企业租赁条例》等一批经济法规，使我国企业体制改革走上法制轨道。
