Jinan Railway Bureau has delved deep into its internal potential, coordinating and collaborating among various marshalling yards within the bureau to alleviate the contradictions between transport capacity and volume. Over the past year, without increasing investment, equipment, or manpower, the bureau has added 16 billion ton-kilometers of transport capacity. Key economic indicators such as passenger and freight volume have increased by 9% for six consecutive years, with transport workload and labor productivity growth rates leading among the twelve railway bureaus nationwide.

Upon analyzing the capacity utilization of various marshalling yards within the bureau, Jinan Railway Bureau found that the capacities of the two major hubs, Xuzhou and Jinan West, were already saturated, while the capacities of Zibo, Dongfeng, and Lancun marshalling yards on the Jiaoji Line were only utilized at 50%. Therefore, the bureau broke the traditional pattern of independent operations among marshalling yards in railway transport organization, which had persisted for over thirty years. The three marshalling yards on the Jiaoji Line—Zibo, Dongfeng, and Lancun—took on part of the marshalling and demarshalling tasks for trains entering the Jinghu Line, reducing the workload at the Jinan hub. This freed up capacity to marshal high-quality direct trains passing through Xuzhou to destinations beyond Nanjing Dong and Nanxiang without needing to stop and re-marshal, significantly enhancing the marshalling, demarshalling, and passing capacities of the two major hubs, Jinan and Xuzhou. In the first half of 1988 compared to the same period in 1987, Jinan West Station handled an average of 9,000 vehicles per day, peaking at over 10,000 vehicles; the Xuzhou hub peaked at over 17,000 vehicles, increasing by 15% and 13.2% respectively compared to pre-reform levels. The increased capacities of the four stations—Xuzhou, Jinan West, Lancun, and Dongfeng—are equivalent to adding a medium-sized marshalling yard, saving the country several hundred million yuan in investment.

　　打破传统模式　发挥整体功能
    济南铁路客货运量连续六年递增
    本报讯  济南铁路局深入挖掘内部潜力，通过路局内各编组站之间的协调联合，缓解了运能和运量的矛盾。一年多来，在不增加投资、设备、人力的情况下，这个局新增运输能力１６０亿换算吨公里。客货运量等主要经济指标连续六年递增９％，运输工作量和劳动生产率增长幅度居全国十二个铁路局的领先地位。
    济南铁路局在分析全局各编组站能力的使用情况时发现，徐州、济南西两大枢纽站的能力已经饱和，而胶济线上的淄博、东风、蓝村编组站的能力却只发挥了５０％。于是，这个局打破了三十多年在铁路运输组织中编组站各自为战的运输组织模式，由胶济线的淄博、东风、蓝村三个编组站承担部分进入京沪列车的编解任务，减少济南枢纽编解工作量，以便腾出能力，多编组通过徐州开往南京东和南翔以远、不需下站重新解体编组的高质量直达列车，使济南、徐州两大枢纽的编解和通过能力大大提高。１９８８年上半年与１９８７年同期相比，济南西站日均办理辆数９０００辆，最高日突破万辆；徐州枢纽最高日突破１７０００辆，分别比改革前提高了１５％和１３．２％。徐州、济南西、蓝村、东风四站所增加的能力，相当于新增一个中型编组站，等于为国家节省了数千万元的投资。
