    The West Should Be Cautious About Soviet Unilateral Disarmament Pledges

    Xinhua News Agency, London, January 29th - The special advisor to U.S. President Bush on arms control, Richard Perle, said today that NATO should adopt a "wait and see" attitude towards Soviet leader Gorbachev's unilateral disarmament promises.

    Perle said in an interview with Britain's Independent Television 4 that NATO should not hastily respond to Gorbachev's announcement last month about reducing 500,000 troops and 6 tank divisions, nor should it prematurely reduce NATO's military strength. He warned that as long as the Warsaw Pact's conventional forces and weapons exceed those of NATO, the threat from the Soviet Union to the West continues to exist. He pointed out that even if the Soviet Union reduces these troops, there will still be an imbalance between the two military blocs.

    Perle also said that NATO should update the short-range nuclear weapons deployed in Western Europe.

    Our correspondent Jiang Jian Guo reported from Bonn on January 30th: The newly appointed U.S. Secretary of Defense, John Tower, said yesterday at the 26th International Defense Knowledge Conference in Munich that although there are signs of a thaw in East-West relations, the threat from the Soviet Union to the West has not diminished. The West must still maintain a modernized military and continue the strategy of negotiating arms reductions from a position of strength. He urged NATO to implement the 1983 decision to modernize short-range nuclear weapons.

    He also urged Western Europe to bear more of the burden of the United States' global responsibilities.

　　对苏联单方面裁军诺言   
    美国强调西方应持谨慎态度
    新华社伦敦１月２９日电  美国总统布什的军备控制问题特别顾问罗尼今天说，北约对苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫的单方面裁军诺言应采取“等着瞧”的态度。
    罗尼在接受英国独立电视４台采访时说，北约不应对戈尔巴乔夫上月关于裁减５０万军队和６个坦克师的宣布匆忙作出反应，过早裁减北约军事力量。他警告说，只要华约的常规力量和武器超过北约，苏联对西方的威胁就继续存在。他指出，即使苏联裁减了这些军队，两大军事集团之间仍然存在着不均衡。
    罗尼还说，北约应该更新部署在西欧的短程核武器。
    本报波恩１月３０日电　记者江建国报道：新任美国国防部长约翰·托尔昨天在慕尼黑的第２６届国际防务知识大会上说，尽管目前东西方关系出现解冻迹象，但苏联对西方的威胁并没有减少。西方仍然必须保持一支现代化的军队，继续维持从实力地位出发进行裁军谈判的战略。他要求北约实施１９８３年短程核武器现代化的决定。
    他还要求西欧更多地分摊美国在世界上的负担。
