On Dalian's Route 23 bus line, starting yesterday, a group of young attendants who make accurate announcements in standard Mandarin, serve passengers enthusiastically, and can converse in English with foreign guests have appeared. They are 47 students from Dalian's Public Transportation Vocational High School who have taken over this bus route.

Dalian currently has over 30 bus routes with more than 10,000 employees. However, most of the attendants are recruited from society, and not only do they have heavy local accents, but they also frequently get into arguments with passengers. To address this situation, Dalian established the Public Transportation Vocational High School last year, recruiting students from society for a two-year professional training program. The students also take over specific bus routes for practical training. The 47 students participating in this takeover have an average age of 18. The surplus income from the takeover will be used by the school to supplement educational funds and student reward funds, with the remaining amount distributed to the students as driving subsidies and bonuses.

　　普通话报站准确　见外宾英语问答
    大连职中生承包一条公交线
    新华社大连１月１３日电  （通讯员王永海）在大连市２３路公共汽车客运线上，昨天起出现了一批报站准确、普通话标准、服务热情、遇见外宾用英语会话的小乘务员。他们是刚刚承包了这条客运线的市公交职业高中的４７名学生。
    大连市现有３０多条电汽车客运线，拥有万余名职工，但大多数乘务员从社会上招工，不仅地方语音重，还经常出现与乘客吵架的现象。针对这一情况，大连市去年办起了公交职业高中，从社会上招收学生，进行为期两年的专业培训，并承包公共汽车专营线作为实习课。这次参加承包的４７名学生，平均年龄１８岁。承包的超额收入由学校提取１０％，补充教育经费的不足和学生奖励基金，剩下的作为出车补助费和奖金发给学生。
