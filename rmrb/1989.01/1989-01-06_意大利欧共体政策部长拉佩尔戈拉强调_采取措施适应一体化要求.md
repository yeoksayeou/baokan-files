Italian Minister for EC Policy Antonio La Pergola, in a written response to a reporter from this newspaper, believes that the "European Integration Document" has opened up concrete avenues for European political unification. The key to achieving this transition lies in the coordination of society and the economy. The large market will ultimately make the EC a more coordinated society, where the disparities between rich and poor regions within the EC will be reduced or eliminated.

The minister pointed out that since 1988, the Italian government has implemented over a hundred EC directives. Italy must overcome inertia and unjustified delays. To this end, the Italian Senate has passed a law submitted by the EC Policy Department, stipulating that the Italian government must present an "EC Law" each year, with the EC Policy Department responsible for reporting to the public the legal regulations issued by the EC.

Italy has encountered numerous difficulties in preparing for the large market and is currently addressing them. Firstly, there is the issue of the fiscal deficit. The Italian government has begun to implement comprehensive economic measures to reduce or control the fiscal deficit and national debt by 1992. Secondly, there is the southern problem. The Italian government has made and is continuing to make specific efforts, with the help of the EC, to adjust industries such as steel and shipbuilding that have been loss-making until now, in order to revitalize the southern economy. The Italian government is focusing on establishing and developing advanced technology sectors such as telecommunications and electronics in state-owned enterprises, while also planning further development of production cooperation between Italian enterprises and those of other European partner countries. In terms of agriculture, Italy is also adjusting its layout to make it more rational.

Editor's Note

The plan for the European Community to establish an internal large market by the end of 1992 has attracted widespread attention and become a global topic. How do several major member countries of the EC view this issue, and how are they actively preparing for the arrival of the large market? Correspondents from this newspaper in Western Europe have interviewed local officials or business representatives on this matter. Their discussions may help readers better understand the large market.

　　意大利欧共体政策部长拉佩尔戈拉强调
    采取措施适应一体化要求
    本报罗马电  记者罗晋标报道：意大利欧共体政策部长安东尼奥·拉佩尔戈拉在书面回答本报记者提问时认为，《欧洲一体化文件》为欧洲政治统一开辟了具体行动的余地，实现这个转折的关键在于社会和经济的协调，大市场最后要使欧共体成为一个更加协调的社会，在这个社会中，欧共体贫富地区之间的差别将要缩小或者消失。
    这位部长指出，１９８８年以来，意大利政府已落实上百项欧共体指令。意大利要克服惰性和没有正当理由的迟缓。为此意大利参议院通过了欧共体政策部提交的一项法律，规定意大利政府每年要提出一项“共同体法”，由欧共体政策部负责向公民通报欧共体所发布的法律规定。
    意大利在准备迎接大市场中碰到不少困难，现正在着手解决。首先是财政赤字问题，意大利政府已开始采取全面的经济措施，以求在１９９２年前减少或尽量控制财政赤字和国债。再就是南方问题，意大利政府已经并在继续作出具体努力，在欧共体帮助下，调整像钢铁、造船等至今亏损的产业，以振兴南方经济。意大利政府在国营企业中着力建立和发展电讯、电子等先进技术部门，同时已计划进一步发展意大利企业同其他欧洲伙伴国的企业之间的生产合作。在农业问题上，意大利也在调整布局，使之更加合理。
　　编后
