Tibetan Party Committee leaders hosted a banquet for Panchen Lama.

Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, January 10th - (Reporter Qun Sang, Central People's Broadcasting Station Reporter Wang Duei) Tonight, leaders of the Tibetan Autonomous Region Party Committee held a welcome banquet for Panchen Erdeni Qoi Gyainzain, who came to Tibet to preside over the consecration ceremony of the joint tombs of the Fifth to Ninth Panchen Lamas.

At the dinner, Vice Secretary of the Autonomous Region Party Committee, Reji, said in his speech that the Panchen Lamas of previous generations were patriotic, unifying, and progressive religious leaders who loved and maintained national unity. In particular, the Ninth Panchen Lama, Qoin Gyainzain, was a prominent anti-imperialist patriot in Tibet's history for his lifelong efforts in maintaining national unity and ethnic solidarity.

He said that the tombs of the Panchen Lamas of previous generations were damaged during the Cultural Revolution. Since 1980, with the joint efforts of the Central Committee of the Party, the local government, and the Tashilhunpo Monastery, the joint tomb has now been completed.

Panchen Vice Chairman said at the dinner that the complete reconstruction of the tombs makes me and the religious community very happy. This fully proves that the Party's policy of freedom of religious belief has been further implemented in the Tibetan Plateau.

He said that last January I came to Tibet, and after a year, I am happy to see that Tibet has made great achievements in various aspects of work. In the future, under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Party, we will strengthen the unity of all ethnic groups, and make new contributions to revitalizing Tibet's economy and prospering ethnic culture.

　　西藏区党委负责人欢宴班禅
    新华社拉萨１月１０日电  （本社记者群桑中央人民广播电台记者旺堆）西藏自治区党委负责人今晚为前来西藏主持五世至九世班禅合葬灵塔开光典礼的全国人大常委会副委员长班禅额尔德尼·确吉坚赞举行欢迎宴会。
    晚宴上，自治区党委副书记热地讲话时说，历代班禅是爱国、团结、进步的宗教领袖，是热爱和维护祖国统一的，特别是九世班禅·曲给尼玛，在终身为维护祖国统一，民族团结方面，是西藏历史上杰出的反帝爱国的领袖。
    他说，历代班禅的灵塔在“文革”中受到破坏。１９８０年以后，在党中央和地方政府及扎什伦布寺的共同努力下，合葬灵塔现已竣工。
    班禅副委员长在晚宴上说，对灵塔的全面新建，我和宗教界人都非常高兴。这充分证明，党的宗教信仰自由政策在西藏高原得到了进一步的落实。
    他说，去年元月我曾来西藏，时隔一年，看到西藏的各项工作取得了巨大的成绩，我很高兴。今后，我们要在党中央的领导下，加强各民族的团结、为振兴西藏经济，繁荣民族文化等做出新的贡献。
