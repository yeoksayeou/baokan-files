The "Jidipolar" ship has withdrawn from the ice shelf of the Larsmann Hills and is now anchored in the ice-free waters of the Prydz Bay.

The research vessel exited the ice field on the afternoon of the 6th. That day, the meteorological personnel on board received a satellite cloud map, which showed that there was a strong cyclone near the coordinates of 61 degrees south latitude and 66 degrees east longitude. They estimated that the front of this cyclone might affect Prydz Bay. Commander Chen Dehong and Captain Wei Wenliang believed that if the cyclone arrived, it would cause strong movements in the ice shelf, posing a risk to the "Jidipolar" ship, which was in the ice fissure. Therefore, they decided to withdraw from the ice area.

According to meteorological observations, the wind and waves have been slightly stronger in the past two days. The "Jidipolar" will re-enter the ice area in the future.

　　我“极地”号撤离冰原
    新华社拉斯曼丘陵１月８日电  （记者张继民）“极地”号船撤出拉斯曼丘陵陆缘冰，现泊在普里兹湾无冰海域。
    这艘考察船是６日下午退出冰原的。这天，船上气象人员收到一幅气象卫星云图，看到地处南纬６１度、东经６６度附近有一强气旋，他们估计，这个气旋的前部可能影响普里兹湾。陈德鸿总指挥和船长魏文良认为，如气旋到来，会造成陆缘冰的强烈运动，易危及处在冰隙中的“极地”号船，因此决定撤离冰区。
    据气象人员观测，近两天风浪略为大些。“极地”号日后将重入冰区。
