	Playing a Significant Role in Economic Compensation
	Insurance Companies Paid Over 4 Billion Yuan in Compensation Last Year
	Total Insurance Premium Income for Domestic and International Business This Year May Reach 11.5 Billion Yuan

	Beijing, January 9 (Xinhua) — Reporter Wang Jinhu reports: The reporter learned from the national insurance work conference held in Beijing that in 1988, China experienced major disasters. During the relief and rescue efforts, insurance played a crucial role in economic compensation. By the end of November last year, the People's Insurance Company of China had paid out 4.13 billion yuan in compensation. Among these, 2.21 million domestic property insurance (including agricultural insurance) claims were handled, with 2.97 billion yuan paid out. Life insurance paid 800 million yuan, and overseas insurance paid 98 million US dollars, all of which played a positive role in stabilizing the economy and ensuring people's livelihoods.

	Last year, provinces such as Zhejiang, Guangxi, Hunan, Inner Mongolia, and Yunnan experienced severe natural disasters, including floods, typhoons, and earthquakes. The affected areas were extensive, and the economic losses were severe. The People's Insurance Company of China promptly allocated funds to support local branches in paying compensation. After Typhoon No. 7 hit, the Zhejiang Provincial Insurance Branch immediately dispatched personnel to the disaster area, quickly handling 133,000 claims and paying out 122 million yuan in compensation. After the earthquakes in Lancang and Gongma, the Yunnan Provincial Branch sent a work team to the disaster area the next day to assess the damage, paying out a total of 30 million yuan in compensation, which helped many enterprises and families avoid devastating losses.

	It is understood that over the past year, China's insurance industry has developed steadily, with an expanded coverage and improved economic benefits. By the end of November last year, the domestic property insurance amount had reached 195.84 billion yuan. The total insurance premium income for domestic and international business increased by 37.57% compared to the same period last year. Profits increased by 21%, and the accumulated insurance reserves increased, thereby significantly enhancing the economic compensation capability. Local insurance companies actively introduced new insurance products to provide supporting services for various reforms. For example, the Shenyang Branch introduced unemployment insurance for employees of bankrupt enterprises, the Shenzhen Branch introduced mortgage life insurance, the Xiamen Branch in Fujian introduced comprehensive personal accident insurance for factory managers, and some companies tried out export commodity seller's contract liability insurance and other businesses.

	Qin Daofu, General Manager of the People's Insurance Company of China, said that this year, China's insurance industry will further develop. The total insurance premium income for domestic and international business is planned to reach 11.5 billion yuan. In particular, rural insurance business will take new steps. In areas where conditions permit, the experience of comprehensive insurance or local statutory insurance will be promoted. The Huai River Basin flood storage insurance will continue to be improved, and third-party liability insurance for tractors will be launched as soon as possible.

　　发挥重要经济补偿作用
    保险公司去年支付赔款４０多亿
    今年国内外保险业务费总收入可达１１５亿
    本报北京１月９日讯  记者王锦鹄报道：记者从正在此间召开的全国保险工作会议上获悉，１９８８年我国发生了重大灾情，在抢险救灾中保险发挥了重要的经济补偿作用。截至去年１１月底，中国人民保险公司共支付赔款４１．３亿元，其中国内财产保险（包括农业保险）处理赔案２２１万件，赔付２９．７亿元，人身险给付８亿元，涉外保险赔付９８００万美元，对稳定经济，安定人民生活都起到了积极作用。
    去年，我国浙江、广西、湖南、内蒙古、云南等地先后发生洪水、台风、地震等重大自然灾害，受灾面广，经济损失严重。中国人民保险总公司及时调剂资金，支持各地分支公司支付赔款。浙江省保险分公司在七号台风袭击后立即抽调人员奔赴灾区，迅速处理赔案１３．３万件，支付赔款１．２２亿元；澜沧、耿马等地发生地震后，云南省分公司次日就派出工作组到灾区查勘定损，共支付赔款３０００万元，使许多企业、家庭免遭毁灭性打击。
    据了解，过去的一年，我国保险事业有了稳步发展，保险覆盖面扩大，经济效益提高，到去年１１月底，国内财产保险额已达１９５８４亿元；国内外保险业务保费总收入比上年同期增长３７．５７％；利润比上年增长２１％，积累的保险准备金增加，从而大大增强了经济补偿能力。各地保险公司积极开办新险种，为各项改革提供配套服务。如沈阳市分公司开办了破产企业职工待业保险，深圳市分公司开办了买房贷款人寿保险，福建厦门市分公司开办了厂长（经理）人身意外综合保险，一些公司试办了出口商品卖方合同责任保险等业务。
    中国人民保险公司总经理秦道夫说，今年我国保险事业将有进一步发展，国内外保险业务费总收入计划达到１１５亿元，特别是农村保险业务要迈出新的步子，在条件允许的地方，推行统保或地方性法定保险的经验；继续搞好淮河流域行蓄洪保险，并尽快开展拖拉机第三者责任保险等业务。
