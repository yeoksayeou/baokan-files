For fear of being drawn into a tariff escalation war, the 12 nations of the European Community, which are in conflict with the United States over meat trade issues, do not want to immediately engage in such a conflict. Tonight, they did not make a decision on the latest retaliation plan and decided to submit the issue to the foreign ministers' meeting scheduled for January 23 for a final decision.

On January 1, the United States imposed a 100% tariff on certain food items (worth approximately $100 million) imported from the Community, in retaliation for the Community's ban on the import of hormone-treated meat from third countries, which took effect on the same day. The Council of Ministers of the Community had previously formulated a retaliation plan, but it needed to be adjusted based on the scale of the U.S. retaliation. The Commission proposed imposing a 100% tariff on two types of food items (dried fruits and walnuts) exported by the U.S. to Western Europe (worth approximately $96 million) to offset the losses caused by the U.S. tariff increase.

Today, the permanent representatives of the 12 countries discussed the retaliation plan in the afternoon. Except for the Netherlands, which still had reservations, the other countries basically agreed with the Commission's proposal. However, the member countries most affected by the U.S. retaliatory measures (such as the Federal Republic of Germany, Denmark, Italy, and the Netherlands) are concerned that a trade war over more than $100 million in trade between Europe and the U.S. could have serious consequences. They hope to wait for the GATT to respond to the dispute before taking action.

After the U.S. announced its retaliatory measures, the Community immediately filed a complaint with the GATT against the U.S. for unilateral retaliatory actions that violate international free trade principles. It is reported that the GATT Council will hear the case in February this year, but it will take several months to make a ruling.

　　为避免卷入关税升级战
    欧共体推迟对美作出反报复决定
    新华社布鲁塞尔１月５日电  （记者诸葛仓麟）欧洲共同体人士透露，因肉类贸易问题而与美国发生冲突的共同体１２国不愿立即卷入一场关税升级战，今晚未就最新反报复方案作出抉择，决定将这一问题提交预定本月２３日举行的成员国外长会议定夺。
    今年１月１日，美国对从共同体进口的若干种食品（价值约１亿美元）征收１００％的关税，以报复同一天生效的共同体停止从第三国进口含荷尔蒙的肉类的禁令。共同体部长理事会早就制定了反报复计划，但尚需根据美国的报复规模加以调整。共同体委员会提出对美国向西欧出口的干果和核桃两类食品（价值约９６００多万美元）征收１００％的关税，以抵销美国提高关税造成的损失。
    １２国常驻共同体代表今天下午讨论反报复方案时，除荷兰尚有保留外，其他国家基本同意委员会的建议。但是，遭受美国报复措施打击最重的成员国（联邦德国、丹麦、意大利和荷兰等）担心欧美为１亿多美元的贸易打轮番升级的贸易战会招致严重后果，希望等关贸总协定对双方争执作出反应后再采取行动。
    共同体在美国宣布报复措施后立即向关贸总协定控告美国单方面报复行为违反国际自由贸易准则。据悉，总协定理事会将于今年２月审理此案，但作出裁决需要几个月时间。
