Premier Li Peng and Vice Premier Yao Yilin met with representatives of the People's Bank of China's provincial branch managers during their conference, listened to their reports, and gave speeches.

Li Peng first fully affirmed the hard work done by the banks in 1988. Li Peng said that the bank workers have worked very hard. The banks have contributed to reform and opening up, to the regulation of the economic environment and the rectification of economic order, and to economic development.

Li Peng said that since the Third Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, the economic situation has shown some good signs. Prices have begun to stabilize, residents' savings have increased, and the procurement of agricultural and sideline products has progressed faster than last year. These situations indicate that the masses have confidence in the prospects of reform and opening up and economic development, and they support the Party and the state's policies.

Li Peng said that since the fourth quarter of last year, the People's Bank and various specialized banks have implemented a tight credit policy, which has begun to curb the overheated economic life. However, the inflation caused by long-term economic overheating cannot be solved in the short term. Adjustment, regulation, and rectification have just begun. Li Peng emphasized that the monetary policy must continue to be tight and cannot be relaxed just because the fourth quarter of last year was relatively tight.

Li Peng pointed out that the current regulation and rectification are not passive but aim to adjust the economic development speed to a more reasonable level and gradually establish a relatively complete macro-control system conducive to the development of socialist planned commodity economy. This will ensure sustained and stable economic development and make reform and opening up healthier. Li Peng emphasized that in the various macro-control measures, the bank's role in regulating the economy should be further enhanced. He stressed that through two years of regulation and rectification, the bank's role in intervening in and regulating the economy should be better played.

Li Peng pointed out that the total amount of money issued this year should be in line with this year's price level and economic growth rate. Special attention should be paid to controlling the rapid growth of consumption funds. Li Peng said that bank loans must be tight, and banks should follow the State Council's regulations, eliminate interference from all sides, and strictly control fixed asset investment loans.

Yao Yilin pointed out in his speech that the money supply was not controlled last year. This was mainly not the responsibility of the banks but the failure of the overall economic work to be controlled.

Yao Yilin said that the economic situation should fundamentally improve within two years. These two years will be a period of considerable tightening, so we must be mentally prepared. The policies decided by the Third Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee must be persistently implemented, with perseverance, not just for a short period. Yao Yilin pointed out that as long as we persistently implement the policies decided by the Third Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, a good situation will definitely emerge.

Yao Yilin pointed out that the basic task of China's national economy this year is to eliminate overheated economic phenomena, making the price increase significantly lower than last year, and at the same time, agriculture should have a good harvest. To this end, the monetary policy must be tightened, but at the same time, the experience of the fourth quarter last year must be summarized, and appropriate support should be given to those that need support. Especially, the adjustment of the industrial structure must consider the basic tasks of the national economy.

Yao Yilin also emphasized in his speech that the tight policy should not only be insisted on by the banks but also by all comprehensive departments.

When Li Peng and Yao Yilin listened to the report from the People's Bank, State Councilor Wang Bingshan, Li Guixian, and other relevant leaders from the State Council were present.

　　李鹏姚依林听取人民银行分行长会议汇报时强调    
    继续抽紧银根抑制通货膨胀    
    增发的货币总量要同今年物价水平和经济增长速度相适应
    新华社北京１月２０日电（记者丁坚铭）国务院总理李鹏、副总理姚依林，在中国人民银行全国分行行长会议开会期间，会见了会议代表，听取了汇报，并讲了话。
    李鹏在讲话中首先对银行１９８８年所做的大量工作给予了充分肯定。李鹏说，银行的同志们工作相当辛苦。银行为改革开放，为治理经济环境和整顿经济秩序，为经济发展作出了贡献。
    李鹏说，党的十三届三中全会以后，经济形势出现了一些好的迹象，物价开始平稳下来，居民储蓄有了增加，农副产品收购进度快于去年。这些情况说明，群众对改革、开放的前景、对经济发展前景是有信心的，人民群众对党和国家的方针政策是拥护的。
    李鹏说，去年四季度以来，人民银行和各专业银行执行了信贷从紧的方针，使过热的经济生活开始受到抑制。但是由于长期的经济过热所带来的通货膨胀不是在短期内可以解决的，调整、治理、整顿还仅仅是开始。李鹏强调，银根必须继续实行从紧的方针，不能因为去年四季度比较紧，现在就可以松一口气了。
    李鹏指出，当前的治理整顿决不是消极的，而是通过调整把经济发展速度降到一个比较合理的水平，并逐步建立起比较完整的有利于社会主义有计划商品经济发展的宏观调控体系，使经济得到持续稳定地发展，使改革开放更加健康地进行。李鹏强调，在宏观调控的众多手段中，今后要更多地发挥银行对经济的调控作用。他强调，要通过两年的治理整顿，把银行对经济的干预、对经济的调控作用更好地发挥出来。
    李鹏指出，今年增发的货币总量要同今年的物价水平和经济增长的速度相适应。特别要注意控制消费基金的过快增长。李鹏说，银行贷款必须从紧，银行要按照国务院的规定，排除各方面的干扰，严格对固定资产投资贷款的控制。
    姚依林在讲话中指出，去年货币投放没有控制住。这主要不是银行的责任，而是整个经济工作没有控制住。
    姚依林说，要在两年时间内使经济形势有一个根本好转。这两年是一个相当紧缩的时期，因此要有思想准备。对党的十三届三中全会确定的方针一定要坚持不懈地贯彻下去，要有韧性，不是只搞一阵子。姚依林指出，只要我们坚持不懈地贯彻党的十三届三中全会确定的方针，就一定会出现一个好的局面。
    姚依林指出，今年我国国民经济的基本任务是消除过热的经济现象，使物价上涨明显低于去年，同时农业要有一个好收成。为此，必须抽紧银根，但同时也必须总结去年四季度的经验，该支持的仍要适当支持。特别是产业结构调整必须考虑到国民经济的基本任务。
    姚依林在讲话中还强调，从紧方针不能只是银行一家要坚持，各个综合部门都要坚持。
    李鹏、姚依林在听取人民银行汇报时，国务委员王丙乾、李贵鲜及国务院其他部门的有关领导在座。
