The fourth National Spring Festival High-Quality Agricultural Products Exhibition and Sale is being held at the Shanghai Agricultural Exhibition Hall. Twenty-one provinces, municipalities (planning single listing cities), and autonomous regions have provided more than 100 varieties of nearly 1,000 tons of high-quality agricultural products for Shanghai residents to choose from, enriching the Shanghai market for the Spring Festival.

The Spring Festival High-Quality Agricultural Products Exhibition and Sale is a good way to organize high-quality agricultural products to enter big cities. The first three exhibitions were held in Beijing. They played a good role in publicizing the achievements of rural reforms and the construction of high-quality product bases, strengthening horizontal development among various places, and exploring new ways for the agricultural sector to participate in circulation. This exhibition will last for 10 days. At the same time, the post-production supporting facilities for Shanghai's high-quality agricultural product base—the Shanghai Agricultural Building—began trial operations recently. This provides a window for Shanghai to connect with more than 400 high-quality product bases across the country.

　　全国春节优质农产品展销会在沪举行
    本报讯  第四届全国春节优质农产品展销会近日起在上海农业展览馆举行。２１个省、市（计划单列市）、自治区提供了１００多个品种的近千吨优质农产品，供上海人民挑选，丰富了上海的春节市场。
    春节优质农产品展销会是组织优质农产品进大城市的一种好形式。前三届展销会都是在北京举行的，它对于宣传农村改革的成果和优质产品基地建设的成就，加强各地之间的横向发展以及探索农业部门参与流通的新路子，都起了很好的作用。这次展销会将举行１０天。与此同时，上海优质农产品基地的产后配套服务设施——上海农业大厦也于近日开始试营业。为上海与各地４００多个优质产品基地的联系提供了一个窗口。
