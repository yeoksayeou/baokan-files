This corporation, which has 63 enterprises and institutions, has always focused on exporting its products and has played a significant role in Beijing's total export earnings. However, in the past, its products were mainly exported through foreign trade companies, leading to issues such as lack of market information and disconnection between production and sales. With the deepening of reform and opening up, and with the approval of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, the corporation will start self-operated import and export business from January 1, 1989.

    北京市工艺美术品总公司今年起自营进出口业务
  　这家拥有６３个企事业单位的企业集团，产品历来以出口为主，在北京市出口创汇总额中占有重要位置，但过去产品主要通过外贸公司出口，存在市场信息不灵，产销脱节等问题。随着改革开放的深入发展，经北京市人民政府批准，自今年１月１日起该公司开始自营进出口业务。
