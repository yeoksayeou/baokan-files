    Chengdu Sentences Four Defendants in Case of Using Railway Special Vehicles for Tobacco Smuggling

    Four defendants in a major case involving the use of railway special vehicles to smuggle high and mid-range cigarettes were sentenced by the Chengdu Intermediate People's Court yesterday.

    This case was uncovered on June 27, 1987. The court presented a large amount of accurate and compelling evidence. The defendant, Wang Tao, deputy head of the Business Office and manager of the Commercial Service Department of the Guiyang Railway Division's Life Management Section, from January 1985 to June 1987, violated the tobacco monopoly regulations. He used the railway special vehicles of the Guiyang Railway Division's Life Management Section to purchase a total of 341,275 cartons of "Jiaxiu," "Yinshan," "Huangguoshu," and "Huaxi" cigarettes from the Guizhou Provincial Tobacco Company's Cigarette Sales Management Department and the Guiyang City Sugar and Tobacco Alcohol Company Wholesale Department. These cigarettes were illegally transported to Chengdu for resale, with a total illegal business volume of 2,071,615.6 yuan, earning 168,162.43 yuan for his unit. The amount involved was particularly huge. Wang Tao, as the direct responsible person for his unit's speculation and profiteering, was sentenced to one year and six months in prison for the crime of speculation and profiteering.

    Another defendant, Gao Zhongren, head of the Station Front Service Department of the Guiyang Railway Division's Life Management Section, from May 1986 to June 1987, used the railway special vehicles of the Guiyang Railway Division's Life Management Section to purchase a total of 96,850 cartons of "Jiaxiu" and "Huangguoshu" cigarettes from the Guiyang City First, Third, and Fifth Tobacco Wholesale Stations. These cigarettes were illegally transported to Chengdu for resale, with a total illegal business volume of 620,911 yuan, earning 77,168.33 yuan for his unit. He was sentenced to one year in prison.

    Another defendant, Zhu Zhenshan, a worker of the Second Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways Labor Service Company, and individual cigarette peddler Zhang Mingqiong, from February to June 1987, violated the tobacco monopoly regulations. They purchased a total of 21,198 cartons of "Jiaxiu" and "Huangguoshu" cigarettes from the illegally transported cigarettes to Chengdu by the Commercial Service Department of the Guiyang Railway Division's Life Management Section. These cigarettes were resold, with a total illegal business volume of 178,418 yuan, earning 4,567 yuan. Their actions constituted the crime of speculation and profiteering, and they were each sentenced to two years in prison, with their property confiscated.

    Chengdu Intermediate People's Court President Yang Guangchang explained the verdict. He said, why did Wang Tao and Gao Zhongren have much larger illegal business volumes and earnings compared to Zhu Zhenshan and Zhang Mingqiong, but their sentences were similar? Because Wang and Gao are direct responsible persons in corporate crimes. The managers or direct responsible persons of corporate crimes are all seeking illegal benefits for their units and do not engage in embezzlement. While Zhu and Zhang are individual citizens committing speculation and profiteering crimes, and their illegal earnings all go to themselves.

    Yang Guangchang said, the reason this case was decided now is that this case spans Sichuan and Guizhou provinces, the crime lasted two and a half years, involved many incidents, and the amounts were huge, requiring time to verify and cross-check with many individuals and units.

　　成都宣判动用铁路专用车倒烟案    
    四名案犯被判处徒刑
    新华社成都１月２９日电（记者徐波）动用铁路专用车辆倒卖高中档香烟的特大案件中的４名案犯，昨天被成都市中级人民法院分别判处徒刑。
    这个案件是１９８７年６月２７日被破获的。法庭出示了大量准确有力的证据。该案被告人、贵阳铁路分局生活管理段业务室副主任兼商业服务部经理汪涛，从１９８５年１月至１９８７年６月，违反烟草专卖条例，利用贵阳铁路分局生活管理段铁路专用车先后２０次从贵州省烟草公司卷烟销售经理部、贵阳市糖业烟酒公司批发部等单位购进“甲秀”、“银杉”、“黄果树”、“花溪”等卷烟共３４１２７５条，非法运至成都倒卖，非法经营总额２０７１６１５．６元，为其单位牟利１６８１６２．４３元，数额特别巨大。汪涛作为单位投机倒把的直接责任人员，其行为已构成投机倒把罪，一审判处有期徒刑１年零６个月。
    同案被告人、贵阳铁路分局生活管理段站前服务部负责人高中仁，从１９８６年５月至１９８７年６月，利用贵阳铁路分局生活管理段铁路专用车，先后１１次将从贵阳市第一、三、五等烟草批发站购得的“甲秀”、“黄果树”等卷烟共９６８５０条，非法运至成都倒卖，非法经营总额６２０９１１元，为其单位牟利７７１６８．３３元。一审判处其有期徒刑１年。
    同案被告人、铁道部第二工程局劳动服务公司工人朱镇山和个体烟贩张明琼，违反烟草专卖条例，从１９８７年２月至６月，先后４次从贵阳铁路分局生活管理段商业服务部非法贩运到成都的卷烟中购进“甲秀”、“黄果树”等卷烟２１１９８条，转手倒卖非法经营总额１７８４１８元，牟利４５６７元，其行为均已构成投机倒把罪，一审分别判处有期徒刑２年，并没收其财产。
    成都市中级人民法院院长杨光长就此案判决作了说明。他说，为什么汪涛、高中仁非法经营额和牟利额均比朱镇山、张明琼的非法经营额和牟利额大得多，而量刑又差不多呢？因为汪、高二人属于法人犯罪中的直接责任人员犯罪。法人犯罪的主管人员或直接责任人员都是为本单位牟取非法利益，没有中饱私囊的行为。而朱、张二人属于公民个人投机倒把犯罪，他们的非法牟利所得全部归自己。
    杨光长说，此案之所以现在才判决，是因为这起案件地跨川、黔两省，作案时间两年半，作案次数多，数额巨大，需要时间找众多的个人和单位查证核实。
