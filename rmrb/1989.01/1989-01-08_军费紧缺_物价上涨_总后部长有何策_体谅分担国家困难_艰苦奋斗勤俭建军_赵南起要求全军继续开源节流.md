The People's Liberation Army's Director of the General Logistics Department, Zhao Nanqi, has called on the entire military to consider the national economic construction, understand and share the nation's difficulties, and work together in a spirit of hard work and frugality to continue living a tight budget.

Zhao Nanqi made these remarks at the opening of the full military logistics work conference today.

Zhao Nanqi said that in 1989, despite financial difficulties, the state has given great consideration to the military budget. However, due to price increases, the emergence of new expenditure items, and the many legacy issues in military construction, this year's budget remains very tight.

Zhao Nanqi said that the less military funding there is, the more it needs to be used efficiently, focusing on ensuring the life and emergency needs of the troops, serving the overall goal of improving the combat effectiveness of the troops. To ensure the focus, all non-essential expenditures must be reduced, especially the expenditures of the headquarters. First, reduce the scale of construction projects; second, reduce the purchasing power of groups; third, reduce public expenditure. These reductions include both budgeted funds and non-budgeted funds, especially plugging the loopholes in non-budgeted funds.

Zhao Nanqi emphasized that in the face of insufficient military funding, an important way to alleviate the supply-demand contradiction is to insist on good production and management, implementing the "standard plus subsidy" approach. He said that the military leadership has repeatedly stressed that the military engaging in production and management is in line with China's national conditions and military situation, benefiting the country, the people, and the military. This is a long-term policy and task. It is of great significance to support national economic construction, reduce the burden on the people, and supplement the supply of the troops. This year, the entire military's production and management should focus on tapping internal potential, striving to improve economic benefits and the production of subsidiary food. First, further develop enterprise factories, military-run factories and mines, and the tertiary industry. This is the main source of revenue generation and making up for the shortage of funds. Second, vigorously develop agricultural and sideline production. This is an important measure to ensure that the living standards of the troops do not decline in terms of actual goods.

Zhao Nanqi said that some units have relaxed their efforts in agricultural and sideline production, and this trend must be corrected. The entire military's farms should focus on grain, vegetable, and feed production, providing more supplementary grain, feed grain, and subsidiary food for the troops. Adjusting the industrial structure, developing diversified operations, and improving economic benefits are all aimed at supporting agriculture with subsidiary industries. At the same time, efforts should be made to improve the subsidiary production of pig raising and vegetable planting in the companies.

Zhao Nanqi finally said that although the military budget is tight, there is still potential to be tapped in both revenue generation and cost reduction. He called on all the broad masses of cadres and soldiers on the military logistics front to fully exert their subjective initiative, take the initiative, further improve "increasing production and saving," strengthen management, improve efficiency, and better serve military construction.

　　军费紧缺　物价上涨　总后部长有何策
    体谅分担国家困难　艰苦奋斗勤俭建军
    赵南起要求全军继续开源节流
    新华社北京１月７日电  （记者郭殿成）人民解放军总后勤部部长赵南起要求全军顾全国家经济建设大局，体谅和分担国家的困难，同心同德，艰苦奋斗，继续过紧日子。
    赵南起是在今天开幕的全军后勤工作会议上讲这番话的。
    赵南起说，１９８９年的军费，国家在财政困难的情况下给予了很大照顾。但由于物价上涨，新增开支项目不断出现，部队建设遗留问题多等原因，今年的日子依然很紧。
    赵南起说，军费越少越要集中使用，重点保障部队生活和战备急需，为提高部队战斗力的总目标服务。为了保障重点，必须压缩一切非急需开支，特别是压缩机关开支。一是压缩基本建设规模，二是压缩集团购买力，三是压缩公务费开支。这些压缩，既包括预算内的经费，也包括预算外的经费，特别要把预算外的漏洞堵住。
    赵南起强调指出，在军费不足的情况下，缓解供需矛盾的一个重要途径，就是坚持搞好生产经营，实行“标准加补助”。他说，军委领导同志多次强调，军队从事生产经营，符合我国的国情、军情，利国、利民、利军，是一项长期的方针和任务。这对于支援国家经济建设，减轻人民负担，补助部队供应，都有重要意义。今年，全军生产经营要在挖掘内部潜力上下功夫，努力提高经济效益和副食品产量。一要进一步办好企业化工厂、军办厂矿和第三产业，这是开源创收、弥补经费不足的主要来源。二要大力发展农副业生产，这是从实物上保证部队生活水平不下降的重要措施。
    赵南起说，有些单位对农副业生产有所放松，这种倾向必须坚决加以纠正。全军农场要着重抓好粮食、蔬菜和饲料生产，为部队多提供一些补助粮、饲料粮和副食品。调整产业结构，开展多种经营，提高经济效益，也是为了以副养农。同时，要抓好连队的养猪、种菜等业余生产。
    赵南起最后说，应当看到，军费虽然紧缺，但在开源和节流两个方面都还有潜力可挖。他要求全军后勤战线的广大指战员，充分发挥主观能动性，积极进取，进一步搞好“双增双节”，加强管理，提高效益，更好地为部队建设服务。
