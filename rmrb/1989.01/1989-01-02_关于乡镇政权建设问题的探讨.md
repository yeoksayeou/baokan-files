The township government is the lowest level of state power established by the state in township administrative areas. It is the foundation of state power and plays a crucial role in rural economic construction, rural social management, and the construction of socialist democracy. However, for a long time, there has been insufficient research on the theory of power, and the political system is far from perfect. The construction of township governments has not yet found a scientific path. With the deepening of economic and political system reforms and the development of commodity economy, the construction of township governments faces many urgent issues that need to be discussed and resolved.

Rural Social Management and Township Government Construction

Any state power has two basic functions internally: political governance and social management. The political governance function of the state power refers to the use of constraints, control, and suppression by state power organs to achieve governance over hostile classes and hostile elements, maintaining a social order that is beneficial to the ruling class. The social management function of state power refers to the use of administrative, economic, legal, and social means by state power organs to manage economic and social affairs. In a socialist society, as class struggle gradually weakens and economic construction develops, the social management function of state power becomes increasingly prominent. How to effectively manage social affairs and better serve economic construction is the fundamental task facing all levels of power organs.

After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, rural areas generally implemented the production responsibility system, greatly liberating productive forces and promoting rural economic development. To adapt to the needs of the production responsibility system, rural grassroots governments reformed the unified political and economic system of the people's communes, universally abolished communes and established townships (towns), setting up township (town) people's governments, initially adapting to the needs of the production responsibility system. However, in terms of functional organs and management systems, although there have been some reforms, there has been no fundamental change. The disorder in the management system is a prominent problem in the current construction of township governments. During the period of the people's communes, the management of rural society was mainly implemented through production brigades and production teams. Production brigades and production teams were both collective economic organizations and rural social management administrative organizations. After implementing the production and operation responsibility system, production brigades and production teams have been dissolved, replaced by village committees and village groups. On one hand, village committees and village groups do not have the economic functions that production brigades had, lacking strong measures to manage villagers. On the other hand, according to the Constitution, village committees are mass self-governing organizations and do not have the administrative management functions that production brigades and production teams had. In actual practice, the function of village committees in managing social affairs is still weak. This causes the township government to lose its grassroots support for rural social management, leading to the spread of various social problems.

The township government is the grassroots state power organ for rural social management and the core of the rural social management organizational system. Therefore, strengthening rural social management, optimizing the rural social environment and order, is an urgent problem that needs to be solved in the current construction of grassroots governments.

Firstly, a new rural social management system should be established with the township government as the center, and the social management functions of the township government should be improved. The township management system includes the scope of the township, the setting of township organizational structures, and their mutual working relationships. Whether the functions of the township people's congress and the township people's government can be effectively exerted, and whether the township people's congress and government can effectively exercise their powers, largely depend on whether the scope of the township's jurisdiction is appropriate. If the scope is too large, it will be difficult to manage; if the scope is too small, the township organizations and personnel will be too many, and the state's financial burden will be too heavy. China's vast territory, with significant differences in the living conditions of rural residents, natural geography, transportation conditions, and economic development levels in the eastern, southern, western, and northern regions, the functions and organizations of township governments should also be based on the actual situation of the township. Secondly, the rural social affairs management system should be improved and perfected, and the supervision and restraint mechanism of the township government in managing rural social affairs should be strengthened. In terms of marriage and family and social customs management, supervision and reform mechanisms should be strengthened, and marriage and family and social customs management should be improved. In terms of social order, laws and regulations should be strictly enforced, the legal system should be improved, and certain village rules and regulations that do not adapt to the new situation should be revised in a timely manner. At the same time, since rural society is not as complex as urban society with a multi-layered structure, the organizational restraint mechanism is single, so a special rural social order management regulation should be established. In terms of social security, a new social security system that adapts to rural production and operation forms should be established, with the township community-based security model as the basis, gradually forming a multi-level, multi-channel, unified leadership, and decentralized management rural social security system. Thirdly, the village committee organization should be improved, and the relationship between the township government and the village committee should be correctly handled. According to the law, the township government unifies the leadership and management of economic and social affairs within the township administrative area. Village self-governance can only be self-governance within the law, and village committees must accept the guidance of the township government. Therefore, the township government organization should fully respect the self-governance rights of village committees, actively guide the healthy development of village self-governance, and at the same time, strengthen the guidance of village committees, fully playing the functions and roles of village committees in rural social management.

Township Government Construction and the Commodity Economy Service System

With the deepening of economic system reforms and the development of rural commodity economy, the most fundamental task facing the construction of township governments is to regulate the rural economic order and establish a service system for rural commodity production. After implementing the production responsibility system, what should be the focus of the second step of rural reform? Whether in the theoretical circles or in the actual work departments, there is still room for further discussion. But the fundamental purpose and task of the second step of rural reform are very clear, that is, to create conditions for developing rural commodity economy and to serve the development of commodity economy.

To develop rural commodity economy, the first step is to solve the contradiction between small-scale production and the market, and to remove obstacles to the development of commodity production. The contradiction between small-scale production and the market mainly lies in the lack of a linkage between individual farmers engaging in commodity production and the overall commodity economy market, and the lack of a complete set of service systems for commodity production, resulting in difficulties in buying, selling, and producing for farmers. As a result, the enthusiasm of farmers for commodity production is suppressed and hindered, obstructing the development of rural commodity economy. How to solve the contradiction between small-scale production and the market? Relying on the self-efforts of farmers to find a way through collisions is certainly a method, but it will incur a great cost and take many detours. A more effective approach is for the government to help farmers form various self-service organizations, consciously strengthen the rural commodity production service system, and establish a new order for the development of rural commodity economy.

Currently, a prominent problem hindering rural commodity production is the segmented management system, which not only restricts the functions of township governments but also weakens the functions of various departments serving rural commodity economy. County (city) departments stationed in townships, such as material stations, grain and oil stations, and agricultural and livestock stations, are all necessary means or channels for developing commodity economy. Due to the implementation of vertical leadership system, township governments have no authority over the personnel, finances, and materials of these departments. While various departments operate independently, it seriously affects the coordinated operation of the township government's management and service mechanisms. Therefore, to establish a township area commodity economy service system, the first step is to reform the segmented management system, adjust the various organizational structures of townships, and enrich and improve the functions of township governments.

The fundamental approach to reforming the segmented management system of townships is to decentralize power and streamline administration, transferring some vertically managed departments stationed in townships to the leadership of township governments. However, decentralizing power and streamlining administration is a comprehensive reform that affects all aspects and involves many conflicts of interest. It is necessary to fully weigh and consider which powers should be decentralized, which should not be decentralized, and to what extent they should be decentralized. After decentralizing power, the township organizations themselves should also make certain adjustments, that is, streamlining administration. Because the township government is basically transformed from the people's commune, it is organized according to the product economy model and is not suitable for the needs of the commodity economy. Adjusting the township government organization should be based on the needs of the township, adhering to the principles of reducing the number of organizations, emphasizing efficiency, and facilitating the service of the commodity economy and the convenience of the people.

Township Government Construction and Socialist Democratic Construction

Our country is a socialist state under the people's democratic dictatorship, and this nature determines that the core of township government construction is socialist democratic construction. Socialist democratic construction includes many aspects, both improving the democratic consciousness of the people and constantly establishing and improving effective democratic forms; both improving the level of democracy and gradually expanding the scope of democracy, and improving various democratic procedures to make socialist democracy institutionalized and legalized.

Township democratic construction is not only an important part of socialist democratic construction but also the foundation of socialist democratic politics. China has a population of one billion, with eight hundred million in rural areas. Whether the democratic rights of eight hundred million farmers can be realized will, from the broadest scope, determine the level of democratization of the entire country. At the same time, from the level of democracy, township democracy is a higher level of direct democracy, leading the construction of democratic politics in China. The report of the Thirteenth Congress pointed out, "The construction of socialist democratic politics in the current stage must focus on effectiveness, focusing on mobilizing the enthusiasm of the grassroots and the masses," "The institutionalization of grassroots democratic life is the guarantee for the working class and the broad masses to be masters of the country, to mobilize the enthusiasm of all parties, and to maintain the stability and unity of the whole society."

The content of township democratic construction is very broad, including democratic consciousness, democratic concepts, and democratic style, etc., while the core is the construction of the people's congress system in the township government. The people's congress system is our fundamental political system, and other democratic systems, such as the election system and the consultation and dialogue system, can all be reflected in the people's congress system. The township people's congress is the power organ of the township people, and is the basic form for the township people to directly exercise their democratic rights to manage state and social affairs. If the township people's congress system is truly sound and perfect, the democratic rights of eight hundred million farmers will have a reliable organizational guarantee.

Currently, the township people's congress does not have a standing committee, which to a certain extent is not convenient for the township people's congress to exercise the powers granted by the Constitution. To solve this problem, some places have established the township people's congress presidium as the standing committee of the township people's congress. This method has a good practical effect, but it lacks legal status. Therefore, how to improve and perfect the township people's congress system is a very worthy issue to study in the current construction of township governments. First, the mindset should be corrected, and the position and role of the township people's congress should be correctly understood, establishing the authority of the township people's congress. Second, the grassroots election system should be gradually improved, truly realizing the democratization of township direct elections, and combining township elections with the inspection of township government work and the assessment of township cadres. Third, new blood should be continuously added to the township people's congress, improving the overall quality of the congress, and enhancing the representatives' ability to deliberate on state affairs. Fourth, the powers granted by the Constitution to the township people's congress should be truly exercised, improving the various systems of the township people's congress itself, such as the meeting system, the system of representatives' contact with voters, and the system of the congress's supervision over the government's work.

Village self-governance is an important part of socialist democratic construction and plays a very important role in the construction of township governments. How to actively guide village self-governance and promote socialist democratic construction is also a major issue facing the construction of township governments.

　　关于乡镇政权建设问题的探讨
　　崔乃夫
    乡镇政权是国家设在乡镇行政区域的最低一级国家政权，是国家政权的基础，对农村经济建设和农村社会管理，对社会主义民主建设都有十分重要的作用。但是，长期以来，对政权理论研究不够，政治体制很不完善，乡镇政权建设还没有找到一条科学的途径。随着经济体制、政治体制改革的深化和商品经济的发展，乡镇政权建设更面临着许多亟需探讨解决的课题。
  　农村社会管理与乡镇政权建设
    任何国家政权对内都有两项基本职能，一是政治统治职能，一是社会管理职能。政权的政治统治职能是指国家政权机关通过约束、控制、镇压等手段，实现对敌对阶级和敌对分子的统治，维护有利于统治阶级的社会秩序。政权的社会管理职能则是指国家政权机关运用行政、经济、法律及社会等手段管理经济和社会事务的职能。在社会主义社会，随着阶级斗争的日渐弱化和经济建设的发展，政权的社会管理职能要求日益突出，如何有效地管理社会事务和如何更好地为经济建设服务，是各级政权组织面临的根本任务。
    党的十一届三中全会以后，农村普遍实行了生产承包责任制，大大地解放了生产力，促进了农村经济的发展。为了适应生产承包责任制的需要，农村基层政权改革了人民公社时期政社合一的体制，普遍撤社建乡（镇），设立乡（镇）人民政府，初步适应了生产承包责任制的需要。但是，乡镇政权在职能机构和管理体制等方面，虽有一定的改革，并没有根本变化。管理体制的不顺，是当前乡镇政权建设中突出的问题。人民公社时期，对农村社会的管理主要通过生产大队和生产队来实施。生产大队和生产队既是集体经济组织，又是农村社会管理的行政组织。实行生产经营承包责任制以后，生产大队和生产队都已解体，代之以村民委员会和村民小组。一方面村民委员会和村民小组没有生产大队时期所具有的经济职能，对村民的管理缺乏强有力的措施。另一方面，依照宪法规定，村民委员会是群众性自治组织，没有生产大队和生产队所具有的行政管理职能。从实际情况看，村民委员会管理社会事务的功能还很弱。这就使乡镇政权失去了农村社会管理的基层依托，造成各种社会问题的蔓延。
    乡镇政权是农村社会管理的基层国家政权机关，是农村社会管理组织体系的中枢。因此，加强农村社会管理，优化农村社会环境和社会秩序，是当前农村基层政权建设急需解决的问题。
    首先，要建立以乡镇政权为中心的新的农村社会管理体制，完善乡镇政权社会管理职能。乡镇管理体制包括乡镇范围、乡镇组织机构设置及其相互工作关系。乡镇人民代表大会和乡镇人民政府的功能能否有效发挥，乡镇人大和政府能否有效行使职权，在很大程度上取决于乡镇管辖范围是否适中。范围过大，则难以管理；范围过小，乡镇机构和干部人员过多，国家财政负担过重。我国地域辽阔，东南西北地区农村居民状况、自然地理、交通条件及经济发展水平差异较大，乡镇政府的职能、机构等也应从本乡镇实际情况出发。其次，要健全和完善农村社会事务管理制度，强化乡镇政权管理农村社会事务的监督约束机制。在婚姻家庭和社会习俗管理方面，要加强监督和改造机制，完善婚姻家庭和社会习俗管理。在社会治安方面，要严肃法纪，健全法制，并适时修订某些不适应新形势的村规民约。同时，由于农村社会没有城市社会那么复杂的多层结构，组织约束机制单一，因此应建立专门的农村社会治安管理法规。在社会保障方面，应建立与农村生产经营形式相适应的新的社会保障制度，以乡镇社区型保障模式为基础，逐步形成多层次、多渠道、统一领导和分散管理的农村社会保障体系。第三，健全村民委员会组织，正确处理乡镇政权与村民委员会的关系。依照法律规定，乡镇政权统一领导和管理乡镇行政区域内的经济和社会事务。村民自治只能是法内自治，村民委员会必须接受乡镇政权的指导。因此，乡镇政权组织，既要充分尊重村民委员会自治权，积极引导村民自治的健康发展，又要加强对村民委员会的指导，充分发挥村民委员会在农村社会管理方面的功能和作用。
  　乡镇政权建设与商品经济服务体系
    随着经济体制改革的深化和农村商品经济的发展，乡镇政权建设面临的最根本的任务，在于治理农村经济秩序，建立农村商品生产的服务体系。实行生产承包责任制之后，农村第二步改革究竟搞什么，无论在理论界还是在实际工作部门都有待于进一步探讨。但农村第二步改革的根本目的和任务，则是很明确的，这就是为发展农村商品经济疏通渠道创造条件，为发展商品经济服务。
    发展农村商品经济，首先要解决小生产与市场之间的矛盾，扫清对发展商品生产的障碍。所谓小生产与市场之间的矛盾，主要是个体农民从事商品生产与整个商品经济市场之间缺乏联系环节，缺乏健全配套的为商品生产服务的体系，致使农民在发展商品经济过程中买难、卖难、生产难。结果压抑和挫伤了农民商品生产的积极性，阻碍了农村商品经济的发展。如何解决小生产与市场之间的矛盾？靠农民自我努力，在碰撞中踩出一条路来，固然是一种办法，但那样要花费很大代价，走许多弯路。更有效的途径，是由政府出面帮助农民组成各种自我服务组织，有意识地强化农村商品生产服务体系，建立起发展农村商品经济的新秩序。
    目前妨碍农村商品生产的一个突出问题是条块分割体制，它既制约了乡镇政府各项职能的发挥，又削弱了条条为农村商品经济服务的功能。县（市）驻乡镇各部门，如物资站、粮油站、农畜站等，都是发展商品经济的必需手段或必经渠道。由于实行垂直领导体制，乡镇政府对这些部门的人财物均无权过问。而各部门“各事其主”，严重影响了乡镇政府管理和服务机制的协调运转。因此，建立乡镇区域商品经济服务体系，首先必须改革条块分割体制，调整乡镇各种组织机构，充实和完善乡镇政府职能。
    改革乡镇条块分割体制的根本途径是放权简政，将一些条条管理的驻乡镇部门下放给乡镇政府领导。但放权简政是一项综合改革，牵一发而动全身，涉及到方方面面的利益，矛盾很多。究竟哪些该放，哪些不该放，放到什么程度，要全面权衡，综合考虑。放权以后，乡镇机构自身还应作哪些调整，就是所谓简政。因为乡镇政权基本上由人民公社转变过来，是按产品经济模式组建的，很不适应商品经济的需要。调整乡镇政权机构，应从本乡镇的需要出发，坚持机构精减，讲求效率，便于为商品经济服务与方便群众的原则。
  　乡镇政权建设与社会主义民主建设
    我们国家是人民民主专政的社会主义国家，这一性质决定了乡镇政权建设的核心是社会主义民主建设。社会主义民主建设包括多方面的内容，既要提高人民群众的民主意识，又要不断建立和完善行之有效的民主形式；既要不断提高民主的程度，逐步扩大民主的范围，又要健全民主的各种程序，使社会主义民主制度化和法律化。
    乡镇民主建设，不仅是社会主义民主建设的重要组成部分，而且是社会主义民主政治的基础。中国十亿人口，八亿在农村。八亿农民的民主权利能否实现，从最广泛的范围决定了整个国家的民主化程度。同时，从民主层次上看，乡镇民主是高层的直接民主，走在我国民主政治建设的前列。十三大报告指出，“现阶段社会主义民主政治的建设，必须着眼于实效，着眼于调动基层和群众的积极性”，“基层民主生活的制度化，是保证工人阶级和广大群众当家作主，调动各方面积极性，维护全社会安定团结的基础”。
    乡镇民主建设的内容十分广泛，包括民主意识、民主观念和民主作风，等等，而中心则是乡镇政权中的人民代表大会制度建设。人民代表大会制度是我们的根本政治制度，其它各种民主制度，如选举制度、协商对话制度等，都可以在人民代表大会制度中得以体现。乡镇人民代表大会是乡镇人民的权力机关，是乡镇人民群众直接行使管理国家和社会事务民主权利的基本形式。乡镇人民代表大会制度真正健全和完善了，八亿农民的民主权利就有了可靠的组织保证。
    目前乡镇人民代表大会没有常设机构，在一定程度上不便于乡镇人民代表大会行使宪法赋予的职权。为解决这一问题，有些地方设立乡镇人民代表大会主席团，作为乡镇人民代表大会常设机构。这种办法实际效果较好，但没有法律地位。因此，究竟如何健全和完善乡镇人民代表大会制是当前乡镇政权建设中很值得研究的问题。第一，要端正思想，正确认识乡镇人民代表大会的地位和作用，树立乡镇人民代表大会的权威。第二，要逐步完善基层选举制度，真正实现乡镇直接选举的民主化，并且把乡镇选举与检查乡镇政府工作、考核乡镇干部结合起来。第三，要不断增添乡镇人民代表大会新鲜血液，提高代表大会整体素质，增强代表的议政能力。第四，要切实行使《宪法》赋予乡镇人民代表大会的职权，健全乡镇人民代表大会自身的各项制度，如会议制度、代表与选民联系制度以及代表大会对政府工作监督制度等。
    村民自治是社会主义民主建设的重要组成部分，在乡镇政权建设中占十分重要的地位。如何积极引导村民自治，促进社会主义民主建设，也是乡镇政权建设面临的重大课题。
