	Reforming management systems and adjusting industrial structures have led to the steady development of the agricultural reclamation system's economy, with industrial and agricultural output doubling in ten years.

		The agricultural reclamation system has undergone ten years of reform, breaking through rigid management systems, adjusting industrial structures, and rationalizing internal economic relations, thereby promoting steady economic development.

		Starting in 1979, the state implemented a financial responsibility system for the agricultural reclamation system; in the same year, farms implemented a contract responsibility system for workers; and starting in 1983, various reclamation areas began establishing family farms. A series of reforms shattered the "iron rice bowl" of state-owned agricultural reclamation workers, promoting the formation of a new dual-layer management structure in the reclamation areas, with large farms encompassing small family farms, and integrated development of agriculture, animal husbandry, and processing.

		Currently, the reform of the agricultural reclamation system has entered a comprehensive deepening stage, implementing a layer-by-layer contract responsibility system centered on the manager responsibility system, and piloting stock ownership and rational labor combinations. Currently, 60% of enterprises have implemented the manager responsibility system, with good results.

		Ten years of reform have brought profound changes to the reclamation areas.

		—Industrial and agricultural output has doubled. From 78.4 billion yuan in 1978, it increased to 244 billion yuan in 1988, a 2.1-fold increase (excluding the value added from over 20 million mu of afforestation). Ten years ago, the state cumulatively invested 16 billion yuan in the reclamation areas, but incurred a cumulative loss of over 3 billion yuan over 12 consecutive years. Ten years of reform have resulted in annual profits, with grain production steadily increasing and an average of tens of billions of kilograms of grain delivered to the state each year; cumulative profits and taxes over ten years reached 8.3 billion yuan and 6 billion yuan, respectively. In 1988, profits amounted to 1.39 billion yuan.

		—The overall labor productivity of all employees increased by 2.2 times over ten years, reaching 4,791 yuan, and workers' income increased by nearly two times.

		The enterprise operational structure has undergone significant changes. The proportion of agricultural and industrial output values changed from 6:4 in 1978 to 4:6 in 1988.

		—Contributions to the state and society have significantly increased. Ten years of reform have established a large number of grain, cotton, sugar, rubber, and agricultural and sideline product production and processing bases, not only providing a large quantity of products to the state and society each year but also supplying over 80% of the commercial milk and 40%-50% of the meat for 16 major cities including Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai. Foreign exchange earnings from exports have also seen significant development, with export earnings reaching 2.24 billion yuan in 1988, an increase of 11.3% from the previous year.

　　改革管理体制　调整产业结构
    农垦系统经济持续发展
    工农业产值十年翻一番
    本报北京１月３日讯  新华社记者任泽励、本报记者陈满正报道：农垦系统１０年改革，打破僵化的管理体制，调整产业结构，理顺内部经济关系，促进经济持续稳步发展。
    从１９７９年开始，国家对农垦系统实行财务包干；同年，农场对职工实行了联产承包责任制；１９８３年起各垦区开始兴办家庭农场。一系列改革，砸碎了国营农垦职工的“铁饭碗”，促进垦区形成大农场套小农场的双层经营新格局，农工畜、种养加综合发展。
    目前，农垦系统的改革已进入全面深化阶段，推行以场（厂）长负责制为中心的层层承包、全员承包，并实行股份制和合理化劳动组合的试点，目前已有６０％的企业实行了场（厂）长负责制，效果良好。
    １０年改革，垦区发生了深刻变化。
    ——工农业产值翻番。由１９７８年的７８．４亿元增至１９８８年的２４４亿元，增长２．１倍（不包括２０００多万亩的造林增值）。１０年前，国家累计向垦区投资１６０亿元，但连续１２年亏损累计３０多亿元。改革１０年，年年盈利，粮食稳步发展，年均向国家交粮数十亿公斤；１０年累计利润、税金分别达８３亿元和６０亿元。１９８８年盈利１３．９亿元。
    ——全员劳动生产率１０年增长２．２倍，达到４７９１元，职工收入增长近两倍。
    企业经营格局发生重大变化。农业和工业的产值比重，由１９７８年的６∶４变为１９８８年的４∶６。
    ——对国家和社会贡献显著增加。１０年改革，已建起一大批粮、棉、糖、橡胶及农副产品生产和加工基地，不仅每年向国家和社会提供大量产品，而且京津沪等１６个大城市８０％以上的商品奶、部分大城市４０％—５０％的肉类都是农场提供的。出口创汇也大步发展，１９８８年出口创汇额达２２．４亿元，比上年增１１．３％。
