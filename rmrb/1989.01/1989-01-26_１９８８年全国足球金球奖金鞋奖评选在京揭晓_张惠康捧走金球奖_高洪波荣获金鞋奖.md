The Golden Ball was selected using a differential voting method.

Zhang Huikang

Zhang Huikang is 27 years old this year, stands at 1.82 meters, and is currently the main goalkeeper for the Chinese national football team. He was selected for the national team from the Shanghai team in January 1987 and was also selected for the Chinese youth team in 1980.

Zhang Huikang is a steady goalkeeper with solid goalkeeping techniques and good timing. In the 1988 Asian Cup qualifiers and finals, due to his outstanding performance, reporters and experts from various countries and the organizing committee unanimously selected him as the best goalkeeper in Asia.

Gao Hongbo

Gao Hongbo is 24 years old this year, stands at 1.80 meters, and is currently the main midfielder for the national team B. In various competitions in 1988, he scored a total of 14 goals and won the 1988 Chinese Golden Boot with 16 points.

Gao Hongbo gained fame in 1985 when he was the main midfielder for the Chinese youth team and scored 5 goals in the final of the Asian Youth Championship, playing a key role in the team's victory. Later, in the final of the FIFA Coca-Cola Cup held in the Soviet Union, he performed excellently and was named the best midfielder.

In 1987, Gao Hongbo joined the national team B from the Beijing team and returned to his youth coach Xu Genbao. In the matches Gao Hongbo participated in, people often found it strange that this tall and thin player did not stand out, but his figure was often seen in front of the goal, and he frequently scored. The secret lies in his good football awareness, excellent timing for shooting in front of the goal, and refined shooting techniques.

    张惠康
    张惠康今年27岁，身高1.82米，现任中国足球队主力守门员。他是1987年元月从上海队入选国家队的，曾于1980年入选中国青年队。
    张惠康是个稳健型守门员，门前技术扎实，时机掌握较好。在1988年的亚洲杯预赛和决赛中，由于他的出色表演，采访的各国记者和组委会的专家们一致推选他为亚洲最佳守门员。    
    高洪波
    高洪波今年24岁，身高1.80米，现任国家二队主力前卫。他在1988年的各项赛事中，共踢进14个球，以积16分的成绩荣获1988年中国金鞋奖。
    高洪波成名于1985年，当时他任中国青年队主力前卫，并在亚洲青年锦标赛决赛中表现出色，共踢进5个球，为中青队夺得冠军立下头功。此后在苏联举行的国际足联可口可乐杯决赛中又有上佳表现，被评为最佳前卫。
    1987年，高洪波从北京队进入国家二队，又回到他少年时代的恩师徐根宝帐下。在高洪波所参加的比赛中人们常常会感到奇怪，这个高高瘦瘦的球员并无出众之处，但门前射门时却时常见到他的身影，而且屡建功勋。其中的奥妙之处在于他足球意识好，门前抢点射门的时机把握得恰到好处，射门的脚法比较讲究。
