People from different places speak differently. When someone hears a particular accent, they can often tell where the person is from. The way people speak can also bring pride or shame to the people of that place.

I remember when I first joined the army, hearing the distinctive Beijing, Tianjin, and Nanjing accents asking me where I was from, I was reluctant to say I was from Suqian. Suqian dialect is harsh, Suqian dialect is rough, and Suqian dialect has a strong rural flavor. Especially among the older soldiers, when they heard that we Suqian people call girls "small big sister," they would laugh and tease me: "Tell us about your hometown's 'small big sister'! Do you have a 'small big sister'? Did your 'small big sister' come to the station to see you off?" Sometimes, when something broke down, they would deliberately mimic my Suqian dialect: "Oh, it's broken." Once, the platoon leader went into the city to run an errand, and I asked him to buy me a "hand towel." He asked several times and still didn't understand. I said it was for washing the face and pillow. He snapped, "Just say towel, will you."

So, I started paying attention to speaking Mandarin, even though I spoke it poorly and stiffly at first. But I persisted in practicing boldly, and gradually, I learned to speak it quite fluently. Unexpectedly, I received a mockery that I will never forget.

That was three years after I enlisted, during my first visit home. I called out to my father in front of the villagers, "Dad, how are you!" The next day, the village was buzzing with the joke: "The third son of the old landlord, after eating a few meals of government rations, learned to speak foreign language. Seeing his 'big' he calls 'ba ba zhen hao' (eight eight twist good), truly begging for food and eating sugar balls—pathetic." I was so embarrassed that I couldn't face anyone. Before my leave was up, I returned to the barracks, and for the next eight years, I didn't visit home again, until later when I got married, had children, and started a family outside.

Last spring, just before the New Year, my father repeatedly wrote to me, insisting that I bring my wife and child back to the old hometown to spend the New Year together. So, the whole family went back for a visit.

As soon as I stepped onto the hometown soil, it brought back that unpleasant memory. My wife, however, didn't mind. She said, "What's there to be embarrassed about? Speaking Mandarin is a sign of progress and civilization."

After returning home, I mentioned that incident to my father. He laughed and said, "Now, no one makes fun of you. Times are better now, and people's hearts are more at ease. Everyone is 'on fire' now. Look at what we eat and wear now, it's almost the same as in the city, and what we speak is also more refined."

What surprised me most was the change in how people address each other. I found that now, the children in the village also call their fathers "Dad." The term that once made me the subject of ridicule is now commonly used by everyone.

From the villagers' mouths, I also heard many new terms and phrases like "competition," "information," "developing a commodity economy, broadening the path to prosperity," "breaking down closed-mindedness, strengthening the consciousness of openness," and so on. I found them particularly interesting and meaningful.

That evening, I thought about many things. I felt a sense of excitement about the changes in the Suqian dialect. I wanted to pick up my pen and write down my feelings. Just then, a few young people came in, and as soon as they entered the door, they shouted, asking me to be their teacher and teach them Mandarin.

They said that in the future, they want to go out and see the world, and learning Mandarin will allow them to communicate and study with others. Their plan is: first, learn Mandarin; second, learn a foreign language.

　　宿迁人·宿迁话
    杨孔柱
    哪里人说哪里话。人们一听某人口音便能判断出某人是哪里人。哪个地方的话也能给哪个地方的人带来骄傲自豪或是羞愧和自卑。
    记得刚参军时，听那韵味十足的北京话、天津话、南京话问俺是哪里人，俺就不好意思说俺是宿迁人。宿迁话硬，宿迁话侉，宿迁话土腥味太浓。尤其是一帮老兵，听说俺们宿迁人都把姑娘叫作“小大姐”，就稀奇地咧嘴大笑，并动不动戏弄俺：讲讲你们家乡的“小大姐”吧！你有没有“小大姐”呀？“小大姐”到没到车站送你呀？……有时什么东西搞坏了，也故意学俺宿迁话：“哟，海了么。”有一次，班长进城办事，俺请他代买一条“手夫”，他问了好几遍还不明白。俺说就是洗脸用的枕头用的。他没好气地说：“你就说毛巾不得了。”
    于是，我就注意学说普通话了，尽管说得不好说得生硬，但我始终坚持大胆练习，慢慢地也就学会了，而且说得相当流利。想不到我竟因此受到一次终生难忘的嘲讽。
    那是当兵三年后第一次探家，我当着众乡亲的面叫了声：“爸爸，您好！”谁知第二天村里就传开了笑话：“老东家的三小子，才吃几天皇粮，就学了一嘴洋话，见到他‘大’叫什么‘八八拧好’，真是要饭吃糖球——穷酸。”弄得我都不好见人。假期未满，我就归队了，从此一别八年未探家，直到后来在外娶妻生子，成家立业。
    去年春节前夕，父亲一再来信，无论如何要我带妻携儿回老家看看，过个团圆年，于是全家才回去一趟。
    一踏上家乡的土地，又勾起我那段难堪的回忆。妻倒不在乎，她说：“这有啥不好意思的？讲普通话是一种进步、一种文明的表现嘛。”
    回到家之后，我跟父亲也提起那段往事，父亲却呵呵笑说，“现在没人笑话你了。如今，日子好过了，心里顺畅了，一个个都‘烧’起来了。你看现在吃的穿的，跟城里人差不多，说的，也都洋叽叽的了。”
    首先叫我惊异的是人称的变化。我发现，现在村里的孩子们也都把他们的“大”叫“爸爸”了。八年前使我受到讥讽的称呼现在常挂在人们嘴边上了。
    我从乡亲们的嘴里还听到许多诸如“竞争”、“信息”、“发展商品经济，拓宽致富路子”、“破除封闭观念，强化开放意识”等等新名词、新语言，更觉得特别有趣特别有味。
    那一天晚上，我想了许多。我对宿迁话的某些演变产生了一种激动。我想拿起笔来把心中的感受记下来。这时，突然来了几个年轻人，他们一进门就嚷嚷着拜我为师，请我教他们学普通话。
    他们说，以后要到外面走走看看，学了普通话才能和人家交谈呀，学习呀。他们的打算是：第一步，先学普通话；第二步，再学外国语。
