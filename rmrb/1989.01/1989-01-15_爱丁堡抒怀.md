Edinburgh is the capital of Scotland, one of the most beautiful cities in Europe, with a population of approximately 500,000. The famous Princes Street Park divides Edinburgh into northern and southern parts, with the south being the old city and the north being the new city. In the old city, ancient palaces, churches, and castles can be found everywhere. Some sections of the streets have cobblestone pavements, and the buildings along the streets still retain their ancient style. The central street is built along a small ridge leading to the ancient castle. Castle Rock is 135 meters high, with steep cliffs on three sides and a steep slope on one side. Climbing up the slope step by step, one reaches the castle. The castle, situated high above, overlooks the Firth of Forth to the north and the road leading to England to the south, making it a very strategic location. It is from this place that Edinburgh began its ancient history.

Ascending the ancient castle slope paved with cobblestones, one sees two Royal Scottish Guards at the first entrance. They are dressed in traditional Scottish attire, with short swords at their waists, deep blue jackets, red and green plaid kilts, and black soft caps without brims. They maintain order and are also available for tourists to take photographs with.

The large cannons lined up on the walls of the ancient castle are said to have never actually fired any projectiles. However, there are two cannons in the castle that are exceptions. One of them fires a shot every day at one o'clock in the afternoon to announce the time to the city. Someone asked why it doesn't fire at noon, and the guide would humorously reply, "Don't forget, this is Scotland. Isn't it more economical to fire one shot at one o'clock than twelve shots at twelve o'clock?" Another ancient cannon from the 15th century weighs five tons and is a massive structure. However, its history is not very honorable. Three hundred years ago, when it was fired to welcome a nobleman, it blew itself apart. There are also a few cannons with such large calibers that a person can climb inside.

The castle contains a military museum, which houses various artifacts from the Middle Ages to the late 19th century, showcasing the evolution and development of European weapons and military uniforms. The crown room's display of the crown, scepter, and sword is a highlight. The crown is made of gold and adorned with pearls. It is said to be the oldest symbol of royal power in Europe, first used in 1306 when Robert the Bruce was crowned.

The ancient buildings within the castle, including the king's bedroom, barracks, dungeons, and churches, are open to visitors. These ancient structures have been preserved in part despite the wars. Among them is a small St. Margaret's Chapel, built in 1076, which is the oldest building in Edinburgh and the oldest church in all of Scotland. Its interior and exterior are simple and unadorned. Every week, a woman named Margaret from the city takes turns coming here to offer fresh flowers and clean up the place.

The Great Hall in the palace courtyard was built in 1502. It is said that its beams and ceiling structures are the best in all of England, with all wooden connections made without a single nail or piece of iron. For many years, the Scottish Parliament was held here. Within the palace, there is a small room where James VI (who later became King James I of England) was born in 1566.

Edinburgh is most famous for the "Edinburgh International Festival of Music and Drama." This international arts festival, which has been held since 1947, takes place every year from late August for three weeks. During this time, renowned arts groups and performers from around the world gather, transforming Edinburgh from morning to night into a grand stage for music, drama, ballet, film, and various art exhibitions and observations. Tourists from all over the globe also flock to the city.

### 爱丁堡抒怀

　　爱丁堡抒怀
    雪舟子
    爱丁堡是苏格兰首府，欧洲最美的城市之一，约有５０万人口。著名的王子街公园将爱丁堡分为南北两部分，以南为老城，以北为新城。在老城，随处都有古代宫殿、教堂和城堡。街头有些地段的路面为石子镶嵌，街旁建筑仍保持古代风格，中心街道沿通往古城堡的小山脊修建。城堡山海拔１３５米，三面峭壁，一面陡坡，沿坡拾级而上，即到城堡。城堡居高临下，北望福思湾，南视接连英格兰的大道，地势十分险要。爱丁堡正是从这个地方开始其古老的历史的。
    登上以卵石砌成的古堡坡道，就见两个皇家苏格兰卫士在第一道入口处守卫。他们身着民族服装，腰佩短剑，上衣深蓝色，下着红绿方格短裙，头戴黑色无沿软帽。他们既维持秩序，又可供游人摄影留念。
    古堡的墙上排列的几尊大炮，据说从来也没有真正发射过炮弹。但古堡中有两尊炮却是例外，其中一尊每天下午一点发一响，向全市报告时间。有人问为什么不在中午报时，导游会幽默地回答你：“别忘了这里是苏格兰，一点放一响不是比１２点放１２响节约得多吗？”另有一尊１５世纪的古炮，重５吨，是个庞然大物。但它的历史却并不体面，３００年前为欢迎一个贵族放礼炮时，竟把自身炸裂了。还有几尊炮，口径之大，可容人钻镗而进。
    城堡中有军事博物馆，收藏从中世纪到１９世纪末的各种实物，展现了欧洲兵器和军服的演变和发展过程。这里的瑰宝当推王冠室陈列的王冠、权杖和御剑。王冠为金质，珍珠镶嵌，最早是１３０６年罗伯特一世加冕时使用的这一套饰物，据说是欧洲最古老的王权象征。
    城堡内的国王寝宫、兵营、地牢、教堂等古建筑都向游人开放。这些古老建筑，历经战乱，只有部分保存。其中有一个小小的圣玛格丽特教堂，１０７６年所建，是爱丁堡最古老的建筑，也是全苏格兰最古老的教堂。它的内外装修朴实无华，该市妇女每周都有一位名叫玛格丽特的轮流到这里献上鲜花，打扫布置。
    宫院中的大殿建造于１５０２年，据称它的大梁、天花板等结构为全英之冠，所有的木结构连接部分没有一钉一铁。过去，苏格兰王国的议会，上百年期间都是在这里召开的。王宫中有个小房间，是詹姆斯六世（后来兼任英格兰国王，称詹姆斯一世）于１５６６年诞生的地方。
    爱丁堡最出名的要数“爱丁堡国际音乐、戏剧节”了。这一国际艺术节，自１９４７以来，每年８月下旬的星期日起，举行为时３周的艺术活动。届时，世界闻名的文艺团体和演员、歌星云集，爱丁堡自晨至暮变为音乐、戏剧、芭蕾、电影和各种艺术展览、观摩的宏伟场地。观光客们也从全球各地涌来。
