Shougang Incorporates Civil Defense Work into Enterprise Contract System
Chi Haotian Emphasizes the Importance of Civil Defense Work in Enterprises

	BEIJING (People's Daily) -- Chief of the General Staff of the People's Liberation Army Chi Haotian on January 10 inspected the civil defense work at the Capital Iron and Steel Company (Shougang) and noted that strengthening civil defense work is not only necessary for national defense but also serves economic construction and cultivates and trains construction personnel.

	The Capital Iron and Steel Company is a pilot unit for economic system reform in the country. In recent years, while carrying out economic system reform, they have also reformed civil defense work. They have taken civil defense work as an important task assigned by the state to enterprises and incorporated it into the contract system for management, creating a new situation in civil defense work. The company has been rated as an advanced unit in civil defense work by higher military authorities for seven consecutive years. Chi Haotian carefully learned about the civil defense work at Shougang and watched a videotape titled "Shougang Civil Defense in the Process of Reform." He happily said: Shougang civil defense is the first enterprise civil defense unit established after the founding of the country, which once represented the national civil defense and accepted the inspection of central leaders. In the reform, this unit has achieved new results, which is worth learning from. Chi Haotian also vividly expounded the relationship between economic construction and national defense. He said: "Things that fly in the sky, sail on the sea, and run on the land all cannot do without steel. Shougang's reform has achieved results, and we who work on military affairs are very pleased."

	Chi Haotian also inspected the construction of the Shougang Armed Forces Department and encouraged them to adapt to the new situation and do a better job in civil defense and reserve force work.

    本报讯  人民解放军总参谋长迟浩田１月１０日在首都钢铁公司考察民兵工作时指出，搞好民兵工作不仅是国防建设的需要，而且能为经济建设服务，锻炼和培养建设人才。
    首都钢铁公司是全国经济体制改革的试点单位。近年来，他们在进行经济体制改革的同时改革民兵工作，把民兵工作作为国家赋予企业的一项重要任务，纳入承包制进行管理，开创了民兵工作的新局面，公司连续７年被上级军事机关评为民兵工作先进单位。迟浩田到首钢详细了解民兵工作的情况，观看了《首都钢铁公司民兵在改革中前进》的录相片。他高兴地说：首钢民兵是建国后建立起来的第一支企业民兵队伍，曾代表全国民兵接受中央领导同志的检阅。在改革中，这支队伍又取得了新的成绩，值得学习。迟浩田还形象地阐述了经济建设与国防建设的关系。他说：“天上飞的，海上行的，陆上跑的，都离不开钢铁。首钢改革有成绩，我们搞军队工作的同志很高兴。”
    迟浩田还检查了首钢武装部的建设情况，勉励他们适应新形势，把民兵、预备役工作做得更好。
