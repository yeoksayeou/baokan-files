    Canada Implements New Anti-Smoking Measures: Banning Tobacco Advertisements and Promotional Signs

    Our correspondent Guo Wenfu reports from Ottawa: According to the "Tobacco Products Control Act" passed by the Canadian federal parliament, starting today, all newspapers and magazines in Canada are prohibited from publishing cigarette advertisements, and all retail stores are not allowed to have promotional signs for cigarettes. This is another new measure taken by Canada in its anti-smoking campaign.

    On January 1 last year, the Canadian federal government decided to ban smoking in all federal government offices. The law prohibiting the publication of tobacco advertisements, which came into effect this year, was passed in the federal parliament in June last year.

    The federal government's new law banning cigarette advertisements also stipulates that cigarette packs must carry warnings about the dangers of smoking.

    In addition to expanding no-smoking areas and banning cigarette advertisements, the government's third major anti-smoking measure is to impose heavy taxes on cigarette sales.

　　加拿大禁烟又有新措施
    禁止香烟广告与推销香烟招牌
    本报渥太华１月１日电  记者郭文福报道；根据加拿大联邦议会通过的“烟草产品控制法令”，从今天开始加拿大所有的报刊不准刊登香烟广告，所有零售商店的招牌中也不准出现推销香烟的广告。这是加拿大在禁止吸烟运动中采取的又一新措施。
    去年１月１日，加拿大联邦政府曾作出决定，禁止在联邦政府所有办公场所吸烟，从今年起禁止刊登烟草广告的法令是去年６月在联邦议会通过。
    联邦政府的新的禁止香烟广告的法令还规定，香烟盒上必须有吸烟害处的警告说明。
    除扩大禁烟区，禁作香烟广告外，政府第三大禁烟措施是对香烟销售课以重税。
