Liu Zheng:

I read your article "Zhuangzi Buys Water" published in the People's Daily on August 6 last year and found it very enjoyable. I have read it several times and still cannot put it down.

However, I think one part could be improved to better criticize the rampant price hikes and excessive fees in society. I suggest deleting the section from "Halfway, I really couldn't move anymore" to "Two gills opening and closing, struggling to breathe" and replacing it with: "After a hard journey of ten days and nights, I finally reached the East Sea. The person in charge of fetching the water was very enthusiastic. He took the delivery note, busily unloading the cart, and fetching the water, not letting Zhuangzi help. When the bucket was full, Zhuangzi hurriedly offered a pack of cigarettes as a token of thanks. The water fetcher pushed the cigarettes away: 'I don't smoke. The handling fee is one yuan per ton, totaling one hundred yuan.' Then, according to the original text, 'Zhuangzi widened his eyes and didn't move.'

Maybe I haven't fully understood your intention. If so, please disregard this suggestion.

Yours sincerely,

Zhuang Chuanbo:

Thank you for your appreciation of my short piece. I will strive to improve and progress further.

Regarding your suggestion for revision, although it enriches the article, I believe the section about encountering the fish in the ruts should be retained. The reasons are as follows:

First, this article is a new interpretation of an old story. Such works should have an ancient event as a basis, and be both similar to and different from the ancient event to be truly delightful. For example, eating Dongpo pork, eating moralizing chicken, or eating small steamed buns from the Qing Palace, all have ancient people and events as references, which can add a unique flavor beyond the original taste. This article involves two passages from the "Zhuangzi": one is the "Autumn Waters" chapter, especially the story of observing fish in the marshes; the other is the story of the fish in the dry ruts from the "External Things" chapter. The latter is particularly interesting. Removing it would make the story bland.

Second, such works should pursue absurdity. It is fine to mix modern and ancient events, and have ghosts, gods, and animals appear on stage to create a bizarre and captivating effect. This article mentions the gods Hai Ruo and He Bo, but they do not directly perform on stage. The most absurd part is this precious fish. If it were not for the fish, the story would be closer to realism and would greatly weaken its legendary color.

Third, and most importantly, the fish, as well as the signs of impending rain and Zhuangzi singing while beating an empty basin, all have deeper meanings. These elements make the article's theme go beyond the shallow level of criticizing improper practices, delving into the hardships, worries, and hopes of the common people, as well as their strong anxiety and firm belief that the rain will eventually come. How could I bear to delete them?

"Even a worn-out broom can be treasured like gold," I insist on keeping the fish, perhaps out of this attachment to the broom. But frankly explaining my views might be the best way to exchange ideas with friends. What do you think?

### 刘征与读者的通信  关于《庄周买水》

　　刘征与读者的通信
    关于《庄周买水》
    刘征同志：
    您发表在《人民日报》去年８月６日上的《庄周买水》，我很喜欢，一直读了几遍仍爱不释手。
    但有一点我意是否改动一下更好。我认为下面添上的内容更能淋漓尽致地鞭挞社会上乱涨价乱收费之风。
    把倒数第四段从“半路上实在挪不动了”到“两鳃一张一合艰难地呼吸着”一段删去，改成“好不容易又走了十天十夜，才到东海。负责提水的倒很热情，拿过提货单，又是忙着咋唬大车，又是忙着提水，不让庄周动手。桶装满了，庄周连忙捧上香烟表示感谢。提水者手一推：‘不抽烟。手续费每吨一元，共计一百元’。”下按原文“庄周睁大了眼睛，一动也不动”。
    也许我没有全面理解您的意思。如是，望一笑弃之。

    掌传柏同志：
    感谢您喜爱我的这篇小文，当益自勉励，以求上进。
    所提改动意见，虽然使文章更加丰富，我却认为路逢辙鱼一节还是保留为好。理由如次：
    一、此文是故事新编。这类东西有古事为据，与古事若即若离，才能佳妙。比如吃东坡肉，吃教化鸡，吃清宫的小窝头，都有古人古事在，才能于本味之外别具一番滋味。此文章牵涉《庄子》里两处文字。一是《秋水》篇，特别是其中濠梁观鱼的故事；一是《外物》篇里涸辙之鲋的故事。后者尤其有趣，去掉它不免索然。
    二、这类东西要追求荒诞，不妨今事古事掺杂，鬼神禽兽登台，才能歪趣横生，令人倾倒。此文虽然抬出海若、河伯两位尊神，但并未请他们直接到前台表演。最为荒诞不经的要算这条宝贝鱼了。如果没有它，文采则近于写实，会大大削弱传奇色彩。
    三、更重要的是，这鱼，以及甘霖欲降的风色和庄周敲着空盆唱歌，都别有深意。这些使文章的主题不止于讽刺不正之风这个大家习见的较浅的层次，而掘进到广大老百姓的艰难、忧虑、期望，以及他们对甘霖久望不来的强烈不安和知其必来的坚定信念。删去，怎么舍得呢？
    “家有敝帚，享之千金”，我坚持保留这条鱼，也许是蔽于这种惜帚之情。但直白地说明自己的看法，也许是同朋友交换意见的最好的方式，你说对不对？
    刘征
