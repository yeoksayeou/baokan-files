    The University of Wisconsin Medical School in the United States has developed a chemical solution that can extend the preservation time of human transplant organs by several times, which helps to improve the success rate of organ transplant surgeries.

    According to the Washington Post, this chemical substance is currently being tested in one hundred hospitals. It can assist doctors in completing surgeries that were previously deemed impossible due to time constraints.

    Experimental results show that this chemical solution can keep a liver in good condition even after being removed from the body for thirty-three hours, which is four times the previous preservation time. Kidneys can be preserved for sixty hours, doubling the previous duration.

    Researchers stated that frozen organs swell due to water content. The design of the new chemical substance is to use osmosis to remove water from the cells of the organ.

　　美发明保存移植器官的溶液
    新华社华盛顿一月二十三日电  美国威斯康星大学医学院，研制了一种可使人体移植器官保存时间延长几倍的化学溶液，这有助于可提高器官移植手术的成功率。
    据《华盛顿邮报》报道，这种化学物质目前正在一百家医院试用。它可帮助医生完成因为需太多时间而以前无法进行的外科手术。
    实验结果表明，这种化学溶液可使肝在离开人体三十三小时后仍保存很好，这是以前保存时间的四倍；肾脏可以保存六十小时，比以前延长了一倍。
    研究人员说，冷冻器官因含水会肿胀。新化学物质的设计是通过渗透作用使器官细胞中的水排出。
