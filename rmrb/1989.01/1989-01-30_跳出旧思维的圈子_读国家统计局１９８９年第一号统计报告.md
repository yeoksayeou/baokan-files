Breaking Free from Old Thinking Patterns
—Reading the National Bureau of Statistics' 1989 First Statistical Report
By Ai Feng, People's Daily Reporter

The statistical bulletins released by the National Bureau of Statistics are often filled with dense statistical figures, making it difficult for general readers to finish them. However, after reading the first statistical report of the National Bureau of Statistics for this year, published on the second page of our newspaper on January 19, one gets a refreshing feeling. It not only provides a comprehensive and clear understanding of China's economic situation in 1988 but also helps people break free from old thinking patterns.

"Was the economic situation in 1988 good or bad?" Many people hope for a clear answer to this question, with "good" and "bad" having simple and absolute meanings in their minds.

Now, the first statistical report of the National Bureau of Statistics for this year (hereinafter referred to as the first report) has been released. Its answer, with the theme "Economic situation with both joys and sorrows," may disappoint those who seek clear answers. In fact, it reveals the objective reality more comprehensively, breaking through that simplified way of thinking.

The first impression: quite realistic

The first impression after reading the first report is that it is quite realistic. Statistical figures themselves give a realistic impression, which is different from general statements. The summary of various figures in the report is also comprehensive, discussing achievements, problems, and prospects. This comprehensiveness also gives a realistic feeling. The proportion of each part is not allocated according to the model of "achievements are the main focus." The part discussing problems is even slightly longer than the part discussing achievements. After reading it, one does not feel discouraged but rather feels that there is a concrete answer to the existing problems, making one more confident.

The report does not use policies to tailor reality but reflects reality as it is. At first glance, it seems to be somewhat "contradictory" with the current policies. For example, in the section "The imbalance in social supply and demand further intensifies," the report provides the public with the following two figures: In 1988, the social purchasing power was 870 billion yuan, an increase of 27% over the previous year, with a gap of 800 billion yuan between the supply and purchasing power. In 1988, the purchasing power of social groups increased by 20.3% over the previous year, which is far from the planned reduction of 20%. These figures are sharp. But they are facts that cannot be avoided. These figures, on the one hand, indicate that people's income has increased significantly, and on the other hand, can help people understand the necessity of the policy of rectification, adjustment, and deepening reform proposed by the Third Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee. The "contrast" between reality and policy, to some extent, shows the pertinence of these policies. If reality and policy completely "overlap," then these policies would not be necessary. A realistic report is not dangerous but reflects our confidence, including our confidence in the public's understanding and tolerance.

In the midst of complaints, accurately estimate achievements

Some people jokingly say that the most abundant harvest in the Year of the Dragon is "complaints" and the "crystallization" of complaints—couplets. If this is seen as a distorted reflection of the "vibrant political atmosphere," then using it alone to judge the economic situation is at least shallow. The first report tells us an important fact: In 1988, China's gross national product was 1369.4 billion yuan, an increase of 11.2% over the previous year. The economic growth rate is not only significantly higher than that of Western developed countries but also higher than that of developing countries, making China one of the few countries in the world with high-speed economic growth.

It is also necessary to consider the following background: The high-speed growth in 1988 is a high-speed growth after continuous high-speed growth since 1979. A recent article by the State Council Research Office, "Progress and Gaps—China's Economic Achievements in the 10 Years of Reform and International Comparisons," provides the following comparison: From 1980 to 1985, the growth rate of gross national product (GNP) was 2.6% on average worldwide, 2.3% in developed countries, 2.1% in the United States, 2.7% in Canada, 4% in Japan, and 3% in developing countries, while China's was 9.2%. According to the World Bank's 1987 World Development Report, from 1980 to 1985, among the 119 countries (regions) surveyed, China's domestic product growth rate ranked second, only behind Botswana; the agricultural growth rate ranked second, only behind the United Arab Emirates; the industrial growth rate ranked fifth; the service industry growth rate ranked first; the investment growth rate ranked second; and the improvement in residents' consumption ranked first.

Of course, when talking about the relatively high growth rate, we cannot ignore that our base is relatively low, nor do we intend to cover up the backwardness in "per capita" terms due to China's large population. However, the above figures at least indicate that China's economy is full of vitality, and the difficulties and problems we are facing now are problems encountered during progress. It is precisely on this point that we should establish our basic estimate and confidence.

The problem lies in overheating and structure

Due to problems such as excessive price increases and chaos in the circulation sector, many people are confused about the current economic situation, and even have serious doubts. In fact, the key is not whether to admit the existence of difficulties and problems, but to have a correct understanding of these difficulties and problems. It is precisely on this point that the first report provides a clearer analysis with a large amount of data. The problem mainly lies in "overheating" and "structure."

Some people are puzzled: You say production has developed, so why are prices still rising so much? The statistical figures here provide the answer: In 1988, the total supply increased by 19.3% over the previous year, while the total demand increased by 22.1% over the previous year, and the supply-demand gap increased from 13.6% in the previous year to 16.2%. In plain terms, it is the phenomenon we all see: there are more goods than before, but there are even more bills. The "more" goods encounter "even more" bills, and prices naturally rise. The excessive bills are mainly caused by economic overheating and excessive demand.

Structural contradictions are more prominent. This is a situation that the report wants people to pay more attention to.

Social income distribution is too biased towards individuals, and the proportion of residents' income in the gross national product has increased from 59.9% in 1984 to 62.6% in 1988. Moreover, the consumption scope is relatively narrow, focusing on food, clothing, and daily necessities, often leading to a rush to buy "big-ticket items." The product structure naturally cannot adapt to this consumption structure in the short term. There is also the development of unfair social distribution. People who instinctively tend towards high consumption naturally need to understand these situations.

The report also provides four main manifestations of industrial structure imbalances: First, the super-high-speed growth of industry and the low-speed growth of agriculture have exacerbated the imbalance between industry and agriculture; second, within the industry, there are two unreasonable biases: the enterprise structure is biased towards rural enterprises, and the industrial structure is biased towards processing industries; third, within agriculture, the production of basic products such as grain, cotton, and oil is unstable, and the supply-demand contradiction is prominent due to the mismatch between the decline in production and the acceleration of population growth. Fourth, the high-speed development of the national economy and the slow growth of transportation capacity coexist, and the transportation tension further intensifies. Although these are not new problems, the report's numerical accuracy more vividly expresses the urgency of solving these problems and helps to unify people's understanding. It can better make people understand the importance of implementing the adjustment spirit in the current rectification and adjustment.

Judgment and propaganda should not be simplified

Observations of the economic situation over the years have followed a linear approach: everything is smooth, and the situation is good; if there are sharp or prominent contradictions, the situation is not good. Correspondingly, it seems that propaganda of a good situation mainly focuses on achievements; if current problems are proposed and analyzed, there is a concern that it will create a bad impression of the situation. Having achievements = good, having problems = bad. Such judgments and propaganda are probably too simplistic.

In fact, good things and bad things often come together. Finding problems is always better than being numb to them. A person running very fast is a good side, but he may run out of breath, isn't that a bad side that comes at the same time? The situation is not judged by whether there are problems, or even by the sharpness of the problems, but by the relationship between problems and progress, and by the nature of the problems—whether it is "running" out of breath or "sick" and out of breath, even if both are difficult to bear. The last sentence of the first report is very appropriate: "Various propaganda work should also be improved, telling the people the difficulties honestly, gaining the people's support, and overcoming difficulties together."

There is one more point that may need to be mentioned: Since the reform, with the diversification of interest subjects, various regions, departments, enterprises, and individuals have had more independent interests; the deepening of the reform will inevitably involve the adjustment of interests among various subjects. This naturally leads to people possibly judging the situation more from the relative rise and fall of their own interests. We do not generally oppose such considerations, but suggest: better understanding the overall situation from the information provided in the first report, finding one's own position, direction, responsibility, and pursuit from it, better connecting local interests with overall interests, and insisting on reform to solve the problems that arise during the reform.

### 跳出旧思维的圈子——读国家统计局１９８９年第一号统计报告

　　跳出旧思维的圈子
    ——读国家统计局１９８９年第一号统计报告
    本报记者  艾丰
    国家统计局发布的统计公报，因充满密密麻麻的统计数字，一般读者往往难以卒读。但读过本报１月１９日二版刊登的国家统计局今年的１号统计报告之后，却有一种耳目一新的感觉。它不仅使人们对１９８８年我国经济状况，有个全面的、清醒的认识，而且对人们跳出旧的思维圈子有一定帮助。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    “１９８８年经济形势到底是好还是不好？”相当多的人总是希望在“好”与“不好”的答案中你明确地给我一个，而“好”与“不好”在他们的思维中又有着简单化、绝对化的含义。
    现在，国家统计局今年第１号统计报告（下简称１号报告）出来了。它所给的答案以“经济状况喜忧交织”为主题，这似乎会使要求明确答案的人感到失望。其实，它正是以更全面地揭示客观实际，突破那种简单化的思维。
    　　　　第一个印象：比较实在
    读１号报告之后的第一个印象是：比较实在。统计数字本身给人的印象当然是实在的，这点上，它与一般的论断不同。报告对纷繁数字的归纳也是全面的，讲了成绩，讲了问题，讲了展望。这种全面性，也给人以实在的感觉。各部分的篇幅比例，也并没有按照“成绩是主要的”模式进行分配。讲问题部分甚至比讲成绩部分略长些。读后并未使人感到泄气，而是觉得对现存问题有了切实的回答，心里更踏实了。
    报告没有用政策剪裁现实，而是如实地反映了现实。初看起来，似乎与现行政策有些“矛盾”。例如在“社会供求总量不平衡进一步加剧”这一段中，报告向公众提供了这样两个数字：１９８８年社会商品购买力为８７００亿元，比上年增长２７％，货源与购买力之间的差距为８００亿元。１９８８年社会集团购买力比上年增长２０．３％，同计划压缩２０％相距甚远。这些数字是有尖锐性的。但它是事实，不能回避。这些数字一方面说明人民收入有了明显增加，另一方面也可以帮助人们理解十三届三中全会提出治理、整顿、深化改革方针的必要性。现实和政策之间的“反差”，从某种意义上正说明这些政策的针对性。如果现实与政策完全“重合”，那么这些政策也就没有必要了。实在的报告并没有危险，恰恰反映了我们的信心，包括对群众理解力承受力的信心。
    　　　　在牢骚中要确切估计成就
    有人挖苦地说，龙年最丰收的是“牢骚”还有牢骚的“结晶”——顺口溜。如果说这是政治上“活跃空气”带有畸形的反映的话，那么仅用它来判断经济形势，恐怕至少有失于浅薄了。１号报告告诉了我们这样一个重要的事实：１９８８年我国国民生产总值为１３６９４亿元，比上年增１１．２％。经济增长速度不仅明显高于西方发达国家，也高于发展中国家，是世界少数几个经济高速增长的国家之一。
    还要考虑到这样的背景：１９８８年的高速增长是在１９７９年以来持续高速增长之后的高速增长。国务院研究室不久前撰写的《进步与差距——我国改革１０年的经济成就及国际比较》一文，提供了这样的比较：１９８０年至１９８５年，国民生产总值（ＧＮＰ）增长率，世界平均为２．６％，发达国家为２．３％，美国为２．１％，加拿大为２．７％，日本为４％，发展中国家为３％，而我国为９．２％。另据世界银行１９８７年世界发展报告，在１９８０—１９８５年其间，在所统计的１１９个国家（地区）中，我国国内生产总值增长率，仅次于博茨瓦纳，居第二位；农业增长率仅次于阿拉伯联合酋长国；工业增长率居第５位；服务业增长率居第一位；投资额增长率居第二位；居民消费提高幅度占第一位。
    当然，在讲较高的增长率的时候，不能忽略我们的基数比较低，也无意掩盖由于我国人口众多在“人均”方面的落后。但是，上述数字起码可以说明：我国的经济正充满发展的活力，我们现在遇到的困难和问题，是前进当中的问题。正是应该在这一点上，建立我们的基本估计和信心。
    　　　　毛病出在过热和结构上
    由于物价上涨幅度过大，流通领域里的混乱现象等等问题，许多人对当前经济形势感到迷惑，甚至产生严重的疑虑。其实，关键不在承认不承认存在着困难和问题，而在于对这些困难和问题要有一个正确的认识。正是在这点上，１号报告以大量的数字给了人们一个比较清晰的分析。毛病主要出在“过热”和“结构”上。
    有人不解地问：你说生产发展了，那么物价为什么还上涨这么多？这里的统计数字给了答案：１９８８年总供给比上年增长１９．３％，而总需求比上年增长２２．１％，供需差率由上年的１３．６％扩大到１６．２％。通俗的解释，就是我们大家都看到的现象：东西比过去多了，而票子比过去更多了。“多”的东西，遇到“更多”的票子，物价自然要涨。而票子过多，则主要是由经济过热，需求过旺造成的。
    结构性矛盾更加突出。这是报告让人们更加注意的情况。
    社会收入分配过于向个人倾斜，居民收入占国民生产总值的比重已由１９８４年的５９．９％上升到１９８８年的６２．６％，况且消费面又比较窄，集中在吃、穿、用上，常常形成抢购“几大件”。产品结构自然短时难以适应这种消费结构。还有社会分配不公平的发展。本能地倾向于高消费的人们，自然很需要了解这些情况。
    报告还提供了产业结构不协调的四个主要表现：一是工业超高速增长与农业低速增长，加剧了工农业之间的不协调；二是工业内部结构出现两个不合理的倾斜，企业结构向乡村企业倾斜，工业结构向加工工业倾斜；三是农业内部粮、棉、油等基础产品生产不稳，产量下降与人口增长加快不相适应，供求矛盾突出。四是国民经济高速发展与交通运输能力缓慢增长并行，运输紧张情况进一步加剧。尽管这些并不是新提出的问题，但报告以数字的确凿性更加鲜明地表示了解决这些问题的迫切性，并有助于统一人们的认识。它更能使人们理解，在当前治理、整顿当中，贯彻调整精神的重要性。
    　　　　判断和宣传不能简单化
    对经济形势的观察，若干年来存在着一种直线的思路：一切顺利，即为形势大好；若遇到尖锐或突出的矛盾，即为形势不妙。与此相对应，似乎宣传形势大好，即主要讲成绩；若提出和分析当前的问题，则担心造成形势不好的印象。有成绩＝好，有问题＝不好。这种判断和宣传恐怕都过于简单化了。
    其实，好事、坏事常常是一块来的。发现问题总比对此麻木要好。一个人跑得很快，是好的一面，但他可能跑得上气不接下气，这不是同时来的坏的一面吗？判断形势如何不在有无问题，甚至不在问题的尖锐程度，而在于问题和进展的关系，在于问题的性质——是“跑”得喘气，还是“病”得喘气，尽管喘不过气都难受。１号报告的最后一句话是很中肯的：“对各种宣传工作也要加以改进，把困难如实告诉人民，取得人民支持，共度难关。”
    还有一点也许应该提及，改革以来，随着利益主体多元化发展，各个地区、部门、企业、个人，都有了更多的独立的利益；改革的深化又必然涉及各主体之间的利益调整。这就很自然地引起人们可能更多地从切身利益相对消长来判断形势。我们并不一般地反对这种考虑，只是建议：更好地从１号报告提供的情况中了解全局，从中找到自己的位置、方向、责任和追求，更好地把局部利益同全局利益衔接起来，以坚持改革来解决改革中出现的问题。
