Zhejiang Formulates Specific Measures to Control Rapid Population Growth

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, January 25th – By the end of 1988, the total population of Zhejiang Province had exceeded 41.6 million. Facing the severe situation of rapid population growth, the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government recently mobilized various parties to contribute their ideas and seek practical and feasible measures.

In the past decade, Zhejiang Province has achieved remarkable results in family planning. According to the birth rate in 1970, the province has cumulatively reduced the population by about 7 million people in 10 years. This alone has saved the country 6.37 billion yuan in child-rearing expenses. However, during the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" period, the birth rate in Zhejiang Province showed an upward trend. From now until the end of the century, the province will have an average of 400,000 men and women entering the marriage and childbearing age each year. If the rapid population growth is not effectively controlled, it will bring great pressure to Zhejiang's economic and social development.

In response, the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government require all levels of leadership departments to work together to further strengthen and improve family planning work. The province, based on listening to and synthesizing opinions from all parties, has proposed practical measures such as implementing a target management responsibility system, adhering to the implementation of the current birth policy and population development plan "dual-track control." The province especially emphasizes the need to strictly manage the more than one million floating population and implement service measures. For regions lagging behind in family planning, each village and household must implement birth quotas and contraceptive measures. At the same time, efforts will be made to strengthen publicity and propaganda to promote the transformation of the marriage and childbearing concepts among the masses.

　　浙江制订具体对策  控制人口过快增长
    新华社杭州１月２５日电（记者何玲玲）１９８８年底浙江全省人口总数已突破４１６０万，面对人口增长过快的严峻形势，浙江省委、省政府最近发动各方献计献策，寻求切实可行的对策。
    近１０年，浙江省计划生育工作成效显著，按１９７０年的生育水平推算，１０年全省累计少生７００万人左右，仅此一项就为国家节省了６３７亿元的巨额抚养费。但进入“七五”期间，浙江省人口出生率出现回升的趋势，从现在到本世纪末，全省每年平均有４０万左右的男女进入婚育期，如果不有效地控制住人口过快增长，将会给浙江的经济和社会发展带来很大的压力。
    为此，浙江省委、省政府要求全省各级领导部门齐抓共管，进一步抓紧抓好计划生育工作。省里在听取、综合各方意见的基础上，提出了切实推行目标管理责任制、坚持执行现行生育政策和人口发展计划“双轨控制”等对策。省里特别提出对全省上百万的流动人口，要严加管理；落实服务措施。对计划生育后进地区，要逐个排队、逐村逐户落实生育指标和避孕节育措施。同时还要加强舆论宣传，促进广大群众婚育观念的转变。
