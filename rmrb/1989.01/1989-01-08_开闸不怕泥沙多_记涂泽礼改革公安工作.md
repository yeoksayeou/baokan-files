Opening the Gates Without Fear of Mud and Sand
— A Record of Tu Ze Li's Reform of Public Security Work

	From the outside, it is hard to believe that he is a police chief: a pair of eye-catching gold-rimmed glasses, a crisp suit, and shiny brown leather shoes. He is Tu Ze Li, the chief of the Jianghan District Public Security Bureau in Wuhan.

	That year, Wuhan opened its city gates, and people from outside flooded into the city like a tide. The floating population in the Jianghan District, located in the city center, surged, reaching an average of 500,000 people per day. The 76 hotels were far from meeting the needs. Some people crowded into the district public security bureau, asking for "leniency" and requesting permits to open hotels.

	Some old police officers shook their heads, saying that hotels are places where criminals can easily hide and settle, and if there are too many, they will be difficult to manage. Tu Ze Li believed: "What is the public security bureau for? If we cannot adapt to the opening up and serve the reform, do we still deserve this olive green uniform? I think that as long as it meets the conditions, we should give the green light."

	Once the "green light" was on, hotels flourished. By the end of last year, the number of hotels in Jianghan District had increased to 324, 3.2 times that of 1985. Surprisingly, although the number of cases in hotels fluctuated, it did not increase proportionally. The reason is: Tu Ze Li led everyone to establish the first hotel industry public security management committee in Wuhan. The hotels themselves selected key personnel, set up reward funds, and established "management committees" by street, taking responsibility for the safety of the hotels under the guidance of the public security organs.

	Next, Tu Ze Li turned his attention to enterprises and institutions. At present, enterprises are undergoing reforms, focusing only on making money and neglecting safety, which is a weakness of many managers. In one unit, a copier was stolen from under the nose of the duty officer. This incident gave Tu Ze Li an idea. He went to the Tangjiawan Street Police Station and asked for the help of Officer Liu, who was knowledgeable in electronics, to develop a simple alarm system. Soon, the inexpensive and practical alarm system was installed in the financial offices and warehouses of valuable items in the jurisdiction. The Wuhan public security system promoted Jianghan District's practice of popularizing technical prevention in enterprises and institutions.

	When technical prevention was just beginning to take shape, Tu Ze Li started another move to strengthen internal unit prevention—security services. He spent three months on a pilot project, then held discussions with factory representatives, and sought approval from the district government... The security industry in Hubei Province was still a virgin land. Therefore, someone advised him: "At the age of 54, why take such risks?" He took a sip of strong tea and, in the manner of a businessman, said: "Creating first-class results cannot be just talk."

	In fact, he was very clear about the advantages of establishing a security organization: hotels and restaurants were increasing in large numbers, and someone had to take care of public security; dance halls and bars were increasing in multiples, and someone had to maintain order; enterprise mergers and enterprise optimization combinations required that security work must keep up; large-scale cultural and sports events, large-scale commercial exhibitions, and more needed security services as a guarantee... In short, relying on the public security alone to perform a "one-man show" was certainly not enough. Social demand was the reason for the emergence of security personnel. When the security guards with large-brimmed hats appeared on the streets of Wuhan, they immediately caused a sensation. At present, this team has developed to 500 people, employed by 123 enterprises, institutions, and individual businesses.

　　开闸不怕泥沙多
    ——记涂泽礼改革公安工作
    王楚　晓红
    从外表看，你很难相信他是公安局长：惹人注目的金丝眼镜，笔挺的西装，锃亮的棕色皮鞋。他就是武汉市公安局江汉分局局长涂泽礼。
    那年，武汉敞开城门，外地人潮水般地涌进江城，位于市中心的江汉区流动人口大增，日均高达５０万人次，７６家旅社远不能满足需要。一些人挤进区公安分局，请求“网开一面”，发给兴办旅社的许可证。
    有些老民警摇头说，旅社是犯罪分子易于藏身落脚之处，办多了，不好管理。涂泽礼认为：“公安局是干什么吃的？适应不了开放，不能服务于改革，还配得上这身橄榄色？我认为，只要符合条件的一律开绿灯。”
    “绿灯”一亮，旅社兴旺。到去年底，江汉区的旅社猛增至３２４家，是１９８５年的３．２倍，奇怪的是，旅社发案虽有起伏，但没有成倍上升。原因是：涂泽礼带领大家建起武汉市第一家旅店业治安管理委员会。旅社自己抽出骨干，拿出奖励基金，以街道为单位成立“管委会”，在公安机关指导下，自己负责旅社的安全。
    接着，涂泽礼又把目光瞄准到企事业单位。时下，企业正在进行改革，只顾赚钱，忽视安全，是诸多经营者的弱点。一个单位的复印机被小偷从值班员的眼皮底下偷走。这桩案件给了涂泽礼启示。他到唐家墩街派出所，请出颇懂电子技术的民警小吕，布置了研制简易报警器的任务。不久，价廉实用的报警器安装到了辖区单位的财会室和贵重物品仓库。市公安系统推广了江汉区对企事业单位普及技术防范的做法。
    当技术防范刚有眉目的时候，涂泽礼又着手开展内部单位防范“双保险”的另一招——保安服务。他抓了三个月的试点，然后找厂家座谈，找区政府要批文……保安业在湖北省还是一片未开垦的处女地。因此有人劝他：５４岁的人了，还冒什么风险。他呷了一口浓茶，俨然以一个企业家的口气说：“创第一流的成绩不能停在嘴上。”
    其实，他非常清楚建立保安机构的优势：宾馆、饭店大量增加，得有人来抓治安；舞厅、酒吧成倍增多，得有人维持秩序；企业兼并，企业优化组合后，安全工作必须同步跟上；大型文体活动、大型营业性展销，更需要安全服务作保证……诸如此类，靠公安一家唱“独角戏”，当然力不从心。社会需求，是呼唤保安人员出台的理由。当头戴大沿帽的保安队员出现在武汉街头，即刻引起反响。目前，这支队伍发展到５００人，受聘于１２３家企业、单位和个体户。
