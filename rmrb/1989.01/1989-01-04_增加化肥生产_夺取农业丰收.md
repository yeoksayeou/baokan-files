Recently, the Party Central Committee and the State Council have made a decision on ensuring a bumper agricultural harvest, emphasizing the need to increase the supply of fertilizers and other agricultural production materials, and striving to complete the production of 85 million tons of fertilizers. All levels of chemical industry departments and the vast number of cadres and workers on the fertilizer front must fulfill their duties, earnestly grasp and promote fertilizer production, increase effective supply to agriculture, and contribute to this year's bumper harvest.

Completing this year's fertilizer production plan is a formidable task. Based on the actual experience of fertilizer production in recent years, four key issues must be addressed.

Firstly, fertilizer production must be given the same importance as agriculture, and a good external environment must be created. Currently, the demand for fertilizers in agriculture is increasing, and the supply-demand contradiction is becoming more pronounced. The increase in fertilizer production capacity is limited, and this year's increase in fertilizer production mainly relies on old enterprises to tap potential. However, the supply of energy and raw materials needed for fertilizer production is insufficient, and existing production capacity cannot be fully utilized. Especially since the fourth quarter of last year, production has declined, and output has dropped sharply, with no signs of improvement. Urgent measures must be taken to reverse this trend; otherwise, it will seriously affect spring fertilizer use.

The immediate task is to implement the Party Central Committee and the State Council's decision to "prioritize the supply of raw materials and energy needed for fertilizer production," creating relatively good external conditions for fertilizer production. Priority must be given to ensuring the supply of electricity, coal, oil, gas, and phosphate ore needed for fertilizer production, allowing enterprises to operate at full capacity and utilize their production capabilities. Currently, the supply of coal needed for small-scale fertilizer production is tight, and a batch of small fertilizer plants in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hunan, and Jilin provinces have stopped production due to lack of raw materials. Local authorities should take measures to prioritize the supply of coal for small-scale fertilizer production. Fertilizer production consumes a large amount of electricity, with low value-added and poor economic returns. Some places have proposed to "reduce electricity consumption for high-energy users and protect enterprises with high value-added and good economic returns," transferring fertilizer production electricity to other industries, causing some fertilizer enterprises to stop or reduce production. This practice must be corrected immediately. The issue here is how to balance enterprise economic benefits and social benefits. Currently, due to the constraints of agricultural product prices, the economic benefits of fertilizer enterprises are indeed not good, but the social benefits of fertilizer products are significant. Therefore, relevant local authorities and departments should prioritize social benefits, allocate electricity to fertilizer production enterprises, and ensure that no unit encroaches on it. The railway and transportation departments should, in the face of tight transport capacity, make every effort to arrange the transportation of phosphate ore from Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, and Hubei provinces, ensuring the supply of raw materials for phosphate fertilizer enterprises. Additionally, continued support policies for fertilizer production should be implemented, reaffirming policies such as exempting fertilizer enterprises from collective electricity construction fees, implementing preferential electricity prices, and reducing product taxes for small-scale fertilizers.

Secondly, deepen the internal matching reforms within enterprises, fully tapping the potential within enterprises. This year, the key to deepening the internal matching reforms of fertilizer enterprises is to improve the enterprise contracting responsibility system, mobilizing the enthusiasm of cadres and workers to increase fertilizer production. Currently, the following four tasks should be prioritized: First, in accordance with the "Enterprise Law," fully implement the factory director responsibility system in fertilizer enterprises, making the factory director the central figure in the enterprise, playing a central role, and taking overall responsibility for production command and management. Second, genuinely introduce a competitive mechanism, select the best managers, and combine competitive bidding with a perfect contracting system. The contracting of fertilizer enterprises should not only focus on profits and taxes but also on production volume, quality, and technological progress. It is not just the factory director who should be responsible for contracting, but the entire workforce. Production volume, quality, efficiency, and safety indicators should be broken down and assigned to each workshop, team, and individual, ensuring that each enterprise's contracting base reaches or exceeds the industry average. Third, reform the internal distribution system of enterprises, solving the problem of egalitarianism in distribution. The completion of fertilizer production volume and quality should be closely linked to distribution, leveraging the incentive function of bonuses. Fourth, actively and steadily promote the optimization of the labor force, implementing a system of selecting the best, eliminating the worst, and allowing the best to take up positions, reducing redundant personnel, achieving the best combination of labor and production resources, and improving the labor productivity of fertilizer enterprises. At the same time, new production and operation channels should be opened, and surplus personnel should be properly arranged.

Thirdly, address issues in the production process. All levels of chemical industry departments should take effective measures to improve enterprise operating rates, quickly reverse the production decline in the fourth quarter, and ensure spring fertilizer use. The principle of tapping potential, innovation, and transformation should be adhered to, striving to reduce energy and raw material consumption, increase production, and improve efficiency. It should be recognized that the potential of existing enterprises is enormous. Just looking at energy consumption, there is a significant gap not only with advanced international standards but also between advanced and backward enterprises within the country, and between advanced and backward regions. For example, the average total energy consumption per ton of ammonia in small nitrogen fertilizer industries is 2,236 kilograms of standard coal in advanced regions, while it is as high as 3,449 kilograms in backward regions, a difference of 1,213 kilograms. The gap is the potential. Reducing consumption means that the same amount of raw materials can produce more products. Continue to promote effective management experiences, such as the "four-managements-one-accounting" method (strengthening process management, raw material management, equipment management, and quality management, and conducting economic accounting) summarized by the small nitrogen fertilizer industry, the safety, stability, long-cycle, and full-load operation management system of large and medium-sized fertilizer enterprises, and the activities to create leak-free factories, clean and civilized factories, and six-good enterprises across the industry.

Fourthly, address issues in the fertilizer circulation process. Under the State Council's principle of monopolizing fertilizer sales, focus on studying specific measures to protect the interests of fertilizer production enterprises and farmers. The State Council has decided that the management method for small-scale fertilizers should be chosen by each province based on actual conditions. In recent years, various places have created many good experiences and practices. For example, Henan and Shandong provinces have adopted a method where county governments issue fertilizer coupons, and farmers use the coupons to purchase directly from factories, eliminating intermediate links, reducing circulation costs, lowering prices, and being welcomed by both enterprises and farmers. Such practices that benefit the country and the people should not only be maintained but also widely promoted.

Given the characteristics of continuous fertilizer production and seasonal use, the key issue of purchasing and storing fertilizers during the off-season must be addressed. Currently, it is already the off-season, and some places in the north have shown signs of overstocking. Fertilizer monopolistic enterprises should closely cooperate with fertilizer production enterprises, support each other, purchase and store in a timely manner, or through pre-ordering, advance the delivery of fertilizers to farmers, hiding fertilizers among the people, solving the problem of enterprise inventory buildup, and ensuring the normal continuous production of enterprises.

Increasing the effective utilization rate of fertilizers is equivalent to increasing new fertilizer sources, which can alleviate the shortage of fertilizers and reduce the burden on farmers. Chemical industry departments and enterprises should actively promote and advocate for scientific fertilization. It should be noted that chemical fertilizers should not overshadow the importance of organic fertilizers, a natural fertilizer source. Practice has proven that when organic fertilizers are reasonably combined with chemical fertilizers, economic benefits are significantly improved. Therefore, the use of organic fertilizers, including green manure and farmyard manure, should be fully valued, and the return of crop straw to the field should be vigorously promoted.

　　增加化肥生产　夺取农业丰收
    秦仲达
    最近，党中央、国务院作出关于夺取农业丰收的决定，其中特别强调要增加化肥等农业生产资料的供应，争取完成生产化肥８５００万吨的任务。各级化工部门和化肥战线广大干部职工，必须尽职尽责，切实抓紧抓好化肥的生产，增加对农业的有效供给，为夺取今年丰收作出贡献。
    完成今年化肥生产计划，任务很艰巨。根据近几年化肥生产的实际经验，必须切实解决好四个方面的问题。
    首先，把化肥生产摆到与农业同等重要的位置，创造一个良好的外部环境。当前农业对化肥的需求量不断增长，化肥供需矛盾日益突出，化肥新增生产能力有限，今年化肥产量的增长主要依靠老企业挖潜。而化肥生产所需能源、原材料供应不足，现有生产能力不能充分发挥。特别是去年４季度以来，生产出现滑坡，产量急速下降，至今没有改观，需要采取有力措施加以扭转，否则，将严重影响今年春耕用肥。
    当务之急，要落实党中央、国务院关于“对化肥生产所需的原料、能源要优先保证供应”的决定，为化肥生产创造比较好的外部条件。要优先保证化肥生产所需电、煤、油、气和磷矿等原材料供应，尽量让企业吃饱开足，发挥生产能力。当前小化肥生产所需煤炭供应趋紧，江苏、浙江、湖南、吉林等省的一批小化肥厂因无原料而停产，各地应采取措施优先保证小化肥用煤。化肥生产耗电量大，度电产值低、效益差，有的地方提出“压耗电大户，保度电产值高、效益好的企业”，把化肥生产用电转用于其它行业，致使部分化肥企业停产或减产，这种作法要尽快予以纠正。这里有一个如何看待企业经济效益和社会效益问题。由于目前受农副产品价格的限制，化肥企业经济效益的确不太好，但化肥产品的社会效益是好的。因此，要请有关地方和部门从社会效益出发，将化肥生产用电带帽下达到企业，规定任何单位不得挤占。要请铁路、交通部门在运力偏紧的情况下，尽力安排好云、贵、川、鄂几省磷矿的外运，确保磷肥企业的原料。另外，要继续对化肥生产实行扶持政策，重申化肥企业免缴集资办电费、实行优惠电价和对小化肥减免产品税等优惠政策。
    第二，深化企业内部配套改革，充分挖掘企业内部潜力。今年深化化肥企业的内部配套改革，关键是要完善企业承包经营责任制，调动广大干部职工增产化肥的积极性。当前要着重抓以下四项工作：一是要按照《企业法》的规定，在化肥企业中全面实行厂长负责制，使厂长在企业中处于中心地位，起中心作用，对企业生产指挥和经营管理工作，统一领导，全面负责。二是要切实引入竞争机制，优选经营者，把竞争招标和完善承包制结合起来。化肥企业的承包不能只是包利税，更重要的是要同时包产量、包质量、包技术进步。不仅是厂长承包，而且是全员承包，要把产量、质量、效益和安全等各项指标，逐项分解落实到每个车间、班组和个人，使每个企业承包基数达到或超过行业的平均水平。三是要改革企业内部分配制度，解决分配上平均主义的问题。要把化肥产量、质量的完成情况和分配紧密挂钩，发挥奖金的利益激励功能。四是积极而又稳妥地推行优化劳动组合，实行选优汰劣，择优上岗，精简冗员，以实现劳动力和生产资料的最佳结合，提高化肥企业的劳动生产率。同时要开辟新的生产经营门路，妥善安置好富余人员。
    第三，抓好生产环节上的问题。各级化工部门要采取有力措施，提高企业开工率，迅速扭转四季度生产滑坡的局面，确保今年春耕用肥。要坚持挖潜、革新、改造的方针，努力降低能源和原材料消耗，增加生产，提高效益。应该看到，现有企业的潜力是很大的。仅就能耗看，不仅同国外先进水平存在很大差距，就是国内先进企业同后进企业之间，先进地区同后进地区之间，也有很大差距。如小氮肥行业平均吨氨总能耗折标煤，先进地区只有２２３６公斤，而后进地区高达３４４９公斤，相差１２１３公斤。差距就是潜力，把消耗降下来，同样的原材料就能生产更多的产品。继续推广行之有效的管理经验，如小氮肥行业总结的“四管一算”办法（加强工艺管理、原料管理、设备管理、质量管理，搞好经济核算），大中型化肥企业的安全、稳定、长周期、满负荷运行管理制度，以及在全行业开展的创建无泄漏工厂、清洁文明工厂和六好企业活动等。
    第四，解决化肥流通环节上的问题。要在国务院对化肥实行专营的总原则下，着重研究如何保护化肥生产企业和农民利益的具体措施。小化肥的经营方式，国务院决定由各省根据实际自行选择。这几年，各地创造了不少好的经验和作法，例如河南、山东等地采取由县政府发放化肥票证，农民凭票直接到工厂购买的办法，取消了中间环节，减少了流通费用，降低了成本，企业和农民都很欢迎。类似这样于国于民有利的作法，不仅不必改变，而且应该大力宣传推广。
    根据化肥常年生产、季节使用的特点，必须重点解决好淡季化肥的收购和储备问题。目前已经进入淡季，北方有的地方已经出现滞销的苗头，化肥专营单位要和化肥生产企业密切配合，相互支持，及时收购储存，或通过预订等办法，提前把化肥送到农民手里，以藏肥于民，解决企业涨库堵库问题，保证企业正常连续生产。
    提高化肥的有效利用率，相当于增加了新的肥源，既能缓解化肥不足的矛盾，还能减轻农民的负担。化工部门和企业要积极宣传和推行科学施肥。需要指出的是，不能有了化肥而忽视有机肥这一天然肥源的重要作用，实践证明，当有机肥与化肥合理搭配使用时，其经济效益显著提高。所以，要充分重视有机肥包括绿肥、农家肥的使用，大力提倡秸秆还田。
