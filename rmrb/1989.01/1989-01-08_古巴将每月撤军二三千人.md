    Xinhua News Agency, Luanda, January 6 - According to today's report by the "Angola Daily," Angolan President José Eduardo dos Santos said on January 3 in Luanda during a meeting with American political figure Jesse Jackson that Cuba will withdraw troops from Angola at a rate of 2,500 to 3,000 troops per month.

    Dos Santos said that the 50,000 Cuban troops in Angola will be completely withdrawn within 27 months starting from April 1, according to the Angola-Cuba New York Agreement.

    He pointed out that before the implementation of the United Nations Security Council's Resolution 435 on Namibian independence starting April 1, the first batch of 3,000 Cuban troops will be withdrawn. The first batch of troops will begin withdrawing from Angola on January 10 and will be completed by March.

    He said that four months after the implementation of Resolution 435, Cuban troops in southern Angola will withdraw northward to the 15th parallel. Seven months later, they will withdraw northward to the 13th parallel. Meanwhile, Cuban troops will withdraw at a rate of 2,500 to 3,000 troops per month. He also pointed out that the estimated total cost for Cuba's withdrawal from Angola is nearly $800 million.

    新华社罗安达１月６日电  据《安哥拉日报》今天报道，安哥拉总统多斯桑托斯３日在罗安达接见美国政界人士杰西·杰克逊时表示，古巴从安哥拉撤军将以每月撤走２５００至３０００人的速度进行。
    多斯桑托斯说，在安哥拉的５万名古巴军队将根据安、古纽约协议从４月１日起的２７个月内全部撤完。
    他指出，在４月１日开始实施联合国安理会关于纳米比亚独立的４３５号决议之前，将首批撤走３０００古巴军队，首批人员将从１月１０日开始撤离安哥拉，至３月份撤完。
    他说，开始实施４３５号决议的４个月后，在安哥拉南部的古巴军队将由南向北撤至南纬１５度线。７个月后，古军北撤至南纬１３度线。与此同时，古巴军队以每个月２５００至３０００人的速度撤回。他还指出，估计古巴从安哥拉撤军的全部费用为近８亿美元。
