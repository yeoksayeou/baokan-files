Xinhua News Agency, Gaborone, January 20th - According to a report from the African News Organization today, South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha announced this afternoon that the "interim government" of Namibia will transfer its powers to the South African-appointed Administrator-General of Namibia.

He said that during today's talks, the two sides discussed the withdrawal of Cuban troops and other related issues concerning Namibia's peaceful transition to independence.
