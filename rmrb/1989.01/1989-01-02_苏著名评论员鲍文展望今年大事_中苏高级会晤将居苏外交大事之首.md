Soviet famous commentator Bao Wen foresees major events of the year
    Sino-Soviet high-level meeting to top Soviet diplomatic agenda

    MOSCOW, Dec. 31 (Xinhua) -- Soviet famous commentator Bao Wen has identified three major events for the coming year: a Sino-Soviet high-level meeting, the complete withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan, and negotiations between the Warsaw Pact and NATO on reducing conventional arms.

    In today's issue of "Komsomolskaya Pravda," Bao Wen pointed out that in the priorities of the Soviet Union's foreign policy, China should be placed above the United States. Neither the Soviet Union nor China wishes to restore an alliance, nor will they use improved relations to pressure third countries such as the United States and Japan.

    He believes that the Soviet Union has finally realized that the people of each country should decide their own destiny without external interference. Attempts to change the course of events in other countries are fundamentally wrong. "The painful truth is better than inspiring deception," he said, adding that the mistakes made in Afghanistan should be told to the people.

    Bao Wen's view is that the reduction of conventional arms in Europe is more important than the reduction of strategic weapons by the Soviet Union and the United States by half, because the negotiations on the latter have already been on track, while the danger of a new round of arms race primarily comes from conventional arms.

　　苏著名评论员鲍文展望今年大事
    中苏高级会晤将居苏外交大事之首
    新华社莫斯科１２月３１日电  苏联著名评论家鲍文把中苏最高级会晤、苏军全部撤出阿富汗和华约同北约谈判削减常规军备称为明年的三件大事。
    他在今天的《共青团真理报》上指出，在苏联对外政策的轻重缓急中，中国应高于美国。苏中都不希望恢复同盟关系，也不会用改善关系向美国、日本等第三国施加压力。
    他认为，苏联终于明白了，每个国家的人民应在不受外来干涉的情况下自己决定自己的命运，改变他国事态进程的做法是根本错误的。“痛苦的真理比鼓舞人心的欺骗好”，应把阿富汗问题上的错误告诉人民。
    鲍文的看法是，欧洲常规裁军比苏美削减一半战略武器更重要，因为有关后者的谈判已走上正轨，而新的一轮军备竞赛的危险首先来自常规军备。
