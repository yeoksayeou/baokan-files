Yichang City Cracks Down on Itinerant Crime

   Over the past six years, Yichang City has captured 1,392 itinerant criminals. The Yichang Public Security Bureau of Hubei Province has been actively participating in the joint operation to crack down on itinerant crime along the Yangtze River from Yichang to Yibin since 1982. Over the past six years, the city has captured 1,392 itinerant criminals, solved 1,208 criminal cases, including 134 major and serious cases, thereby stabilizing the social order in the city.

   Yichang City is an important port on the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River and the location of the Gezhouba Water Conservancy Project. With developed water and land transportation, it is known as the "throat of Sichuan and Hubei." In recent years, the city has seen a daily influx of over 100,000 outsiders. Some itinerant criminals have taken advantage of this situation to commit crimes, posing a threat to social order. Facing this severe situation, the Public Security Bureau, in accordance with the spirit of regional cooperation, organized 287 militia members into several patrol teams to strengthen control over the public areas. While focusing on criminal investigation work, the Public Security Bureau also strengthened cooperation with public security agencies in other cities and counties. For inquiries about cases and suspects from public security agencies within the cooperative region, they have records, verification, and feedback. In response to the difficulties in discovering, interrogating, verifying, and handling itinerant criminals, they have established files and cards for each individual, using these materials to combat itinerant criminals. Over the past six years, they have established 30,000 files and cards. Last year, through the use of these files and cards, they captured 50 itinerant criminals.

　　宜昌市打击流窜犯罪活动     
    ６年来共抓获流窜犯罪分子１３９２名
    本报讯  湖北省宜昌市公安局自１９８２年加入长江沿线宜昌至宜宾区域打击流窜犯罪活动联防协作以来，坚持打击流窜犯罪活动。６年来，全市共抓获流窜犯罪分子１３９２名，从中破获各类刑事案件１２０８起，其中重大特大案件１３４起，稳定了全市社会治安秩序。
    宜昌市是长江中上游的重要港口之一，又是葛洲坝水利工程所在地，水陆交通发达，素有“川鄂咽喉”之称。近几年来，全市每年外来人口日流量达１０万以上，一些流窜犯罪分子混杂其中伺机作案，危害社会治安。面对严峻的治安形势，市公安局根据区域协作精神，组织民兵２８７名，分成若干巡逻小组，加强社会面的控制。市公安局在抓好自身刑事侦察工作的同时，注重加强同兄弟市、县公安机关的协作。对协作区内公安机关请求查询案件和人犯的电话，有记录、有查证、有回音。针对流窜犯发现难、审讯难、查证难、处理难的情况，他们逐个建档建卡，运用这些资料打击流窜犯。６年来，他们建档建卡３万多份。
    去年，通过档卡资料就抓获流窜犯５０名。　　（王齐生　周剑敏）
