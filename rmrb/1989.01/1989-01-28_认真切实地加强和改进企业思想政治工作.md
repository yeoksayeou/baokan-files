We must seriously and concretely strengthen and improve enterprise ideological and political work.

Our Party has a fine tradition of ideological and political work. Ideological and political work has always been one of our Party's political advantages. Whether during the war years or the period of socialist construction, our Party has always attached great importance to ideological and political work.

In September 1985, Comrade Deng Xiaoping, in his speech at the Party's National Representative Conference, said regarding ideological and political work, "It must be greatly strengthened and must not be weakened." He also said: reform and modern scientific technology, plus our emphasis on politics, will make our strength even greater. Comrade Zhao Ziyang has repeatedly urged us to grasp both material and spiritual civilization. He said we must "grasp reform and opening up with one hand and ideological and political work with the other, and neither should be neglected." At the Third Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, Comrade Zhao Ziyang again emphasized the need to bring into play the Party's political advantages and the role of ideological and political work.

After the change in the enterprise leadership system, the factory director is responsible for the overall development of both material and spiritual civilization in the enterprise. Some people think that this has lowered the status of ideological and political work and weakened it.

I believe this is a complete misunderstanding.

During the revolutionary war period, our Party's ideological and political work was closely integrated with military work and was very effective. From then until now, the military has always implemented a system of ideological and political work under the responsibility of the commander. This has in no way weakened the military's ideological and political work. The factory director's overall responsibility for both material and spiritual civilization in the enterprise is in line with the new enterprise leadership system, meets the requirement that ideological and political work is an important part of the overall enterprise management, and is in keeping with the needs of economic system reform and enterprise modernization management. It provides organizational and institutional guarantees for changing the situation where ideological and political work and production and operation are "two separate entities."

The factory director's overall responsibility for both material and spiritual civilization in the enterprise does not mean that the enterprise Party organization will no longer engage in ideological and political work. Communist Party members and Party organizations must propagate the Party's principles among the masses and do ideological and political work among the masses. This is the duty of Party members and the responsibility of Party organizations. The enterprise Party organization should actively carry out ideological and political work under the new system of the factory director's overall responsibility. In the new situation, ideological and political work should create new forms, structures, and new experiences.

Our factory directors must not only manage production and operations well but also learn how to lead the enterprise's ideological and political work. I heard that this year the Textile Industry Department plans to train incumbent factory directors through correspondence courses, which is a good idea. In addition to managing ideological and political work through the administrative system, factory directors must also know how to rely on the Party organization, respect and support the democratic management of the trade union and the workers' congress, and bring into play the role of various mass organizations.

Not long ago, I visited the Zhengzhou Cotton Mill No. 3 and the Henan Textile Machinery Factory in Henan Province and discussed enterprise ideological and political work with some of the leaders there, and listened to the experience of the Zhengzhou Textile Machinery Factory. I saw that after the change in the leadership system, the factory directors have taken on the responsibility of "grasp both material and spiritual civilization" quite well, and the Party organization and various mass organizations are also playing their respective active roles in enterprise ideological and political work. Their practice shows that changing the enterprise leadership system has not weakened ideological and political work, and some new experiences have already been gained.

I believe that as long as we resolutely implement the requirements of the "Notice of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Strengthening and Improving Enterprise Ideological and Political Work" and strive to create new experiences in enterprise ideological and political work, our ideological and political work will definitely be continuously strengthened and fully brought into play.

Some aspects that enterprise ideological and political work should focus on at present

Enterprise ideological and political work has many aspects, but I think the following should be focused on at present:

1. Continuously deepen the education on the situation to enhance the Party and government's cohesion among the people.

To achieve this, first, through education on the situation, we must conduct re-education on the Party's Thirteenth National Congress line, the general policy and general principles of reform and opening up, and use the theory, line, and policies of the Thirteenth National Congress to arm and unify the thoughts and actions of the entire Party, and unite the strength of the entire nation to strive for the "Four Modernizations and the Rejuvenation of China."

Second, help the masses correctly understand the situation, correctly understand the achievements of the past ten years of reform, boost spirits, overcome pessimistic sentiments, and strengthen confidence and courage in reform. In these ten years, we have indeed achieved great successes. For example, the production of major industrial and agricultural products, although there is still a significant gap in per capita possession compared to economically developed countries in the world, has undergone significant changes in terms of national total possession ranking internationally. Compared to 1978, grain production has risen from second to first; cotton and meat have risen from third to first; steel has risen from fifth to fourth; raw coal has risen from third to first; crude oil has risen from eighth to fifth; electricity generation has risen from seventh to fourth; cement has risen from fourth to first, and so on.

Third, help the masses correctly understand and deal with the difficulties and problems that arise during the reform, recognize that reform is a great and arduous undertaking, and it is impossible to be smooth sailing. The problems we encounter now are problems of progress and development, and we must see our bright future and support the Party and government's determination and actions to overcome difficulties.

Fourth, make the people understand and know that reform is not about seeing immediate benefits, but about establishing a new socialist system that promotes the development of social productive forces.

2. We must do a good job in publicizing the guiding principles and specific policies of the Third Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee. In conjunction with the implementation of the resolutions of the Third Plenary Session, we must do a good job of publicity and explanation among the masses to make the implementation of the resolutions of the Third Plenary Session a conscious action of the masses.

3. In conjunction with the deepening of enterprise reform, carry out production and cost-saving activities, improve enterprise economic benefits, increase effective supply, stabilize market prices; commend good deeds and good people; advocate a frugal and thrifty style.

4. Establish a good enterprise spirit, professional ethics, and social ethics, and help the Party and government carry out clean government activities.

5. Ideological and political work should care for people, respect people, and cherish people. Party organizations, Party members, leading cadres, and political work cadres must all be close friends of the masses, help the masses solve problems, strengthen dialogue with workers, improve work methods, and enhance the attractiveness of ideological and political work.

6. Party organizations and Party members must play the role of a fighting fortress and a vanguard model. Trade unions, the Communist Youth League, the Women's Federation, and the Ideological and Political Work Research Association and other mass organizations must bring into play their respective advantages in ideological and political work.

　　认真切实地加强和改进企业思想政治工作
    芮杏文
    要认真地、切实地加强和改进企业思想政治工作
    我们党有很好的思想政治工作传统。思想政治工作历来是我们党的一个政治优势。无论战争年代，还是社会主义建设时期，我们党是一贯重视思想政治工作的。
    １９８５年９月，邓小平同志在党的全国代表会议的讲话中讲到思想政治工作时说：“必须大力加强，决不能削弱。”他还说过：改革和现代化的科学技术，加上我们讲政治，威力就更大了。赵紫阳同志也一再要求我们两个文明一起抓。他说要“一手抓改革、开放，一手抓思想政治工作，二者不可偏废”。在党的十三届三中全会上，赵紫阳同志再一次强调发挥党的政治优势，发挥思想政治工作的作用。
    企业领导体制改变后，实行厂长对企业的两个文明建设全面负责。有人认为，这样做思想政治工作的地位下降了，是对思想政治工作的削弱。
    我认为这完全是一种误解。
    革命战争时期，我们党的思想政治工作与军事工作紧密结合，很有声色。从那时起直到今天，军队一直实行首长负责制下的思想政治工作的体制。这样做，丝毫没有削弱军队的思想政治工作。厂长对企业的两个文明建设全面负责，是与企业新的领导体制相适应的，符合思想政治工作是整个企业管理工作的重要组成部分的要求，顺应了经济体制改革和企业现代化管理的需要，为改变思想政治工作与生产经营“两张皮”的状况，提供了组织上和制度上的保证。
    厂长对企业的两个文明全面负责，并不意味着企业党组织就不抓思想政治工作了。共产党员、党的组织，要在群众中宣传党的主张，做群众的思想政治工作，这是党员的义务和党组织的职责。企业党组织要在厂长全面负责下的思想政治工作新体制中积极地开展思想政治工作。在新的情况下，思想政治工作要创造出新的形式、格局和新的经验。
    我们的厂长，不仅要抓好生产经营，而且要学会如何领导企业的思想政治工作。听说今年纺织部要通过函授培训现职的厂长，这是一个很好的主意。厂长除了要通过行政系统抓好思想政治工作外，还要懂得依靠党组织，尊重、支持工会、职代会的民主管理，发挥各群众团体的作用。
    前不久，我去河南省郑州国棉三厂和河南省纺织机械厂参观，就企业思想政治工作问题，同那里的一些领导干部座谈，并听取了郑州纺织机械厂的经验介绍。我看到他们在领导体制改变后，厂长已经较好地挑起了“两个文明一起抓”的担子，党组织和各群众团体，也在企业思想政治工作中发挥着各自的积极作用。他们的实践证明，改变企业的领导体制，思想政治工作并没有削弱，而且已经有了一些新的经验。
    我相信，只要我们坚决按照《中共中央关于加强和改进企业思想政治工作的通知》的要求去做，努力创造企业思想政治工作的新经验，我们的思想政治工作是一定会不断得到加强和充分发挥作用的。
    　　　　当前企业思想政治工作要注意抓好的几个方面
    企业思想政治工作的内容很多，我想当前首先要抓好以下几方面：
    １．把形势教育不断推向深入，增强党和政府在人民群众中的凝聚力。
    做到这一点，一要通过形势教育进行党的十三大路线的再教育，改革、开放总方针、总政策的再教育，用十三大的理论、路线和政策来武装、统一全党的思想和行动，凝聚全民族的力量，为“实现四化、振兴中华”而奋斗。
    二要帮助群众正确认识形势，正确认识十年改革的成绩，振奋精神，克服消极悲观情绪，坚定对改革的信心和勇气。这十年，我们确实取得了很大成绩。例如工农业的主要产品产量，尽管在人均占有量上和世界经济发达国家比还有很大差距，但在国家的总量占有国际位次上已经发生了很大变化。１９８７年和１９７８年相比，谷物从第二位上升为第一位；棉花、肉类从第三位上升为第一位；钢从第五位上升为第四位；原煤从第三位上升为第一位；原油从第八位上升为第五位；发电量从第七位上升为第四位；水泥从第四位上升为第一位，等。
    三要帮助群众正确认识和对待改革中出现的困难和问题，认识到改革是无比艰巨的伟大事业，不可能是一帆风顺的，现在遇到的问题，是前进中、发展中的问题，要看到我们的光明前程，相信并支持党和政府克服困难的决心和行动。
    四要使人民群众理解和懂得，改革不都是马上能见到多少实惠的，而是为了建立能促进社会生产力发展的社会主义新制度。
    ２．要搞好十三届三中全会指导方针和具体政策的宣传。配合三中全会决议的贯彻实施，在群众中做好宣传解释工作，使三中全会决议的贯彻落实成为群众的自觉行动。
    ３．配合企业的深化改革，开展增产节约活动，提高企业经济效益，增加有效供给，稳定市场物价；表彰好人好事；提倡艰苦朴素、勤俭节约的作风。
    ４．确立良好的企业精神、职业道德和社会公德，帮助党和政府开展廉政活动。
    ５．思想政治工作要关心人、尊重人、爱护人。党组织、党员、领导干部和政工干部都要做群众的知心朋友，为群众排忧解难，加强与职工的对话，改善工作方法，提高思想政治工作的吸引力。
    ６．党组织和党员要发挥战斗堡垒作用和先锋模范作用。工会、共青团、妇联和思想政治工作研究会等群众组织，要在思想政治工作中发挥各自的优势。
