Beijing Baihua Wallpaper Factory has introduced technology and equipment from Britain and West Germany to produce composite nine-color deep-pressed wallpaper with an advanced level of the 1980s. From the first day of trial production, it has used domestically produced raw and auxiliary materials.

In China, many imported production lines use "foreign machines" with "foreign materials." Once the "foreign materials" are cut off, the machines have to be put on hold. Learning from this lesson, Beijing Baihua Wallpaper Factory started researching and experimenting with the domestication of raw materials from the day it began preparing to introduce foreign technology. They invested 170,000 yuan to sample and analyze imported paper, glue, ink, and other raw and auxiliary materials. Through repeated trials and research by domestic scientific research departments, they produced domestically made materials suitable for use with "foreign machines."

The production of wallpaper requires high-tech base paper. The factory tested foreign base paper and sent various physical and chemical test indicators to six major paper mills in Northeast China, Fujian, Sichuan, and other regions for development and trial production. Foreign experts tested and found that the base paper produced by Yalu River Paper Mill met the requirements. Beijing Baihua Wallpaper Factory immediately signed a ten-year supply contract with Yalu River Paper Mill and invested 100,000 yuan to upgrade the paper mill's production line. Over the years, the factory has established horizontal connections with many enterprises, successfully solving the problem of raw and auxiliary material sources. Since the official trial run on March 1, 1988, the factory has been able to produce three categories, eighteen varieties, and more than sixty different patterns of wallpaper. The products will be exported back to Europe and the Soviet Union.

　　北京百花壁纸厂洋机器吃土原料
    本报讯  北京百花壁纸厂引进英国和联邦德国的技术和设备，生产具有八十年代先进水平的复合九色深压花壁纸。从试生产的第一天起就全部采用国产原、辅料。
    在我国，有不少引进生产线，都是“洋机器”吃“洋料”，一旦“洋料”断源，机器就得搁浅。借鉴这一教训，北京百花壁纸厂从出国考察学习，准备引进的那一天起，着手原料的国产化研究和试验。他们投入了十七万元，对进口的纸、胶、油墨等原、辅料进行取样分析，经我国科研部门的反复试验、研究，生产出了适合“洋机器”使用的国产材料。
    生产壁纸需要技术要求很高的底纸，该厂对国外底纸进行测试后，将各种理化测试指标，寄给东北、福建、四川等六个大造纸厂开发试制。外国专家测试后，认为鸭绿江造纸厂生产的底纸符合要求，百花壁纸厂立即与鸭绿江造纸厂签订了十年的供货合同，并出资十万元，改造造纸厂的生产线。几年来，该厂和许多企业建立了横向联系，成功地解决了原、辅料的来源。一九八八年三月一日正式试车以来，该厂已能生产三大类十八个品种，六十多种花色的壁纸，产品将返销欧洲和苏联。
