The Bank of China is providing multi-functional services to promote the implementation of the coastal development strategy. This was revealed by Bank of China President Wang Dexin at the national branch managers' meeting held today.

To accelerate the collection and settlement of foreign exchange, the Bank of China has reduced the average time for settling foreign exchange from exports via ocean shipping from 26-30 days to 18-20 days over the past six months. In particular, ports such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenzhen, and Xiamen have shortened the settlement time to around 12 days, matching the speed of foreign banks.

Supporting the development of export-oriented economies. Last year, the Bank of China promptly allocated $700 million in short-term foreign exchange loans to coastal regions. Of this amount, $500 million has been distributed by the headquarters to domestic branches for use; the $200 million issued by the Hong Kong branch of the Bank of China was focused on supporting Shanghai, Jiangsu, Shandong, Zhejiang, and Guangxi. The headquarters also appropriately relaxed the approval authority for foreign exchange loans of branches, approved more branches to open accounts in Hong Kong and Macao, and allowed them to borrow and lend short-term foreign exchange funds within the planned scope.

Better serving foreign-invested enterprises. As of the end of November 1988, the Bank of China's outstanding foreign exchange and RMB loans to foreign-invested enterprises had reached $1.2 billion and 5.135 billion yuan, respectively. A total of 2,904 foreign-invested enterprises supported by loans from the Bank of China have been established, accounting for 24.2% of the total number of foreign-invested enterprises nationwide. The Bank of China also provides assistance in areas such as leasing and consulting.

　　中国银行提供多功能服务
    上海、天津等地远洋出口结汇速度不低于外商银行
    本报北京１月１２日讯  记者计泓赓报道：中国银行为促进沿海地区经济发展战略的实施，提供了多功能的服务。这是中国银行行长王德衍今天在全国分行行长会议上透露的。
    加速收汇，加快结汇。经过半年来的努力，中国银行对企业的远洋出口结汇平均天数，已由过去的２６—３０天缩短到１８—２０天。其中上海、天津、深圳、厦门等口岸分行远洋出口结汇天数已缩短到１２天左右，结汇速度已不低于外商银行。
    支持外向型经济发展。去年中国银行及时对沿海地区增加了７亿美元短期周转外汇贷款指标。其中５亿美元已由总行分配给国内分行使用；香港中银集团发放的２亿美元，重点支持了上海、江苏、山东、浙江、广西等沿海省市。总行还适当放宽分行的外汇贷款审批权限，批准了更多的分行在港澳联行开设帐户，并允许他们在计划许可范围内，拆借融通短期外汇资金。
    更好为外商投资企业服务。截至１９８８年１１月底，中国银行对外商投资企业的外汇和人民币贷款余额，已分别达１２亿美元和５１．３５亿元。由中国银行贷款支持建立起来的外商投资企业已达２９０４家，占全国外商投资企业总数的２４．２％。中国银行并在租赁、咨询等方面给以帮助。
