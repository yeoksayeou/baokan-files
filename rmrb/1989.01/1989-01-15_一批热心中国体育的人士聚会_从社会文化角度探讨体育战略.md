A gathering of enthusiasts for Chinese sports discusses sports strategy from a social and cultural perspective

	Beijing, January 14th, 1989 - A "Sports Culture Symposium" initiated by civilians concluded today. It is reported that this is the first time in 40 years since the founding of the nation that such a "Sports Culture Symposium" has been held in this form.

	Participants included individuals from various sectors such as sports, economics, theory, culture, enterprise, and news. They discussed the concept and essence of sports, the role and function of sports as a cultural form in social development, the relationship between competitive sports and school sports as well as mass sports, the successes and shortcomings of the current sports system in China, the allocation of sports funds, the popularity of sports among the elderly versus the lack of interest among youth, the attributes and impact of gold medals, and other related issues. They also analyzed sports, particularly the current and strategic problems facing Chinese sports, from a broad cultural perspective using methods from sociology, economics, and management.

	The symposium also focused on the reportage "The Dream of a Strong Nation" and the various discussions sparked by the Olympics. In an atmosphere of equality, participants candidly discussed how to view the achievements and problems of China's sports sector, how to view the performance of Chinese athletes in the Olympics, how to develop sports through various levels and forms in a commodity economy, how to cultivate well-rounded athletes, how to strengthen the management of sports teams, and how to create a relaxed public opinion environment.

	This symposium has changed the previous trend of only studying sports from a sports perspective. More people have analyzed issues from the angles of social and economic development and the social functions of culture, raising the level of sports theoretical research. The event was initiated by the Cultural Research Institute of Shougang Research and Development Company and China Cultural Daily, among other units.

　　一批热心中国体育的人士聚会
    从社会文化角度探讨体育战略
    本报北京１月１４日讯  记者吴骅报道：一个由民间发起的“体育文化研讨会”今天在此间结束。据称，这是建国４０年来第一次以这种形式召开的“体育文化研讨会”。
    参加研讨会的有体育、经济、理论、文化、企业和新闻等社会各界人士，他们从不同的角度对体育的概念与本质、体育作为一种文化形态在社会发展中的地位和功能、竞技体育同学校体育及大众体育的关系、中国体育现行体制的成功与弊端、体育经费的分配、老年体育热与青少年体育冷、金牌的属性和作用等问题阐述了自己的看法和观点，并运用社会学、经济学、管理学等方法从大文化的角度剖析体育，尤其是我国体育当前面临和需要解决的战略问题。
    围绕着报告文学《强国梦》和奥运会后引起的对我国体育的各种议论也成为这次研讨会的主要议题之一。在平等的气氛中，与会者坦率地就如何看待我国体育战线的成绩和问题，如何看待我国体育健儿在奥运会的表现，商品经济的大环境下如何通过全社会多层次、多形式的发展体育，如何培养一代全面发展的运动员、如何加强体育队伍的管理，以及怎样创造一种宽松的舆论环境等问题各抒己见。
    这次研讨会使过去仅就体育而研究体育的现象有所改观，更多的人从社会经济发展和文化的社会功能等角度分析问题，提高了体育理论研究的层次。发起这次活动的是首钢研究发展公司文化研究所、中国文化报等单位。
