Argentine government forces suppressed a rebellion

Six dead, twenty-seven injured

Xinhua News Agency Buenos Aires, January 23rd: Argentine government forces ceased their suppression of armed rebels who had seized the headquarters of the Army's Third Infantry Regiment early on the 24th.

According to Carlos Besela, Secretary-General of the Argentine Presidency, speaking to the press, the attack on the Third Infantry Regiment in Taborda was a "finished episode." He added that government forces are currently searching for remaining rebel elements in Taborda and eliminating scattered resistance points.

Xinhua News Agency Buenos Aires, January 23rd: Early on the 23rd, approximately 50 unidentified armed individuals, traveling in one truck and six cars, took advantage of the soldiers' absence during the weekend to launch a surprise attack on the headquarters of the Army's Third Infantry Regiment, located 5 kilometers southwest of Buenos Aires. They also seized the camp's armory.

Upon receiving the news, Argentine President Alfonsín immediately ordered the suppression of the attackers of the Third Regiment, describing them as "criminals," and instructed Defense Minister Haunayena and Army Chief of Staff Gasino to send troops to retake the camp.

According to official announcements, as of now, including soldiers, police, and civilians, a total of 6 people have died and 27 have been injured. Although the identities of the armed individuals who occupied the camp have not been publicly disclosed, they claim to belong to the "New Argentine Army" and support the leaders Rico and Seneldin, who organized a military mutiny two years ago.

　　阿根廷政府军平息一次叛乱    
    六人死亡　二十七人受伤
    新华社布宜诺斯艾利斯１月２３日电  阿根廷政府军２４日凌晨停止了对攻占陆军第三步兵团团部武装分子的镇压行动。
    据阿根廷总统府秘书长卡洛斯·贝塞拉对新闻界说，在塔布拉达发生的偷袭第三步兵团事件，是个“已经结束的插曲”。他还说，政府军现正在塔布拉达搜捕残余叛乱分子，扑灭零星的抵抗点。
    新华社布宜诺斯艾利斯１月２３日电　２３日凌晨，约５０名不明身份的武装分子乘一辆卡车和６辆小车，趁官兵度周末度假未归之机，偷袭了位于阿根廷首都布宜诺斯艾利斯西南５公里处的陆军第三步兵团团部，并夺取了营区军火库。
    阿根廷总统阿方辛闻讯后，立即指示坚决镇压袭击第三团的“犯罪分子”，并下令国防部长豪纳雪纳和陆军参谋长加西诺派兵夺回兵营。
    据官方宣布，到目前为止，包括军人、警察和平民在内，共死６人，伤２７人。虽然占领军营的武装分子还未公开身份，但他们自称属于“阿根廷新军”，支持前两年组织军人哗变的头目里科和塞内尔丁。
