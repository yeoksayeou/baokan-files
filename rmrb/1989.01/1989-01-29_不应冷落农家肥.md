Title: We Should Not Neglect Farmyard Manure

Farming requires nurturing the land, and growing crops primarily relies on farmyard manure. This has been a fine tradition among Chinese farmers for many years. In recent years, this old tradition has been abandoned. The practice of not nurturing the land, neglecting farmyard manure, and over-relying on chemical fertilizers has become quite common.

Chemical fertilizers have the advantages of high effectiveness, quick results, and convenience in use and transportation. With the development of the chemical fertilizer industry, the average amount of chemical fertilizer used per acre by Chinese farmers has exceeded the world average by more than one fold, yet the demand for chemical fertilizers continues to rise. Using only chemical fertilizers year after year, without adding organic matter to the soil, and without applying manure, cake fertilizer, peat, human and animal waste, green manure, and returning crop stalks to the field as appropriate, is very harmful. Neglecting organic fertilizers is detrimental to increasing humus in the soil, forming granular structure, breeding microorganisms, keeping the soil loose and well-ventilated, and retaining an appropriate amount of moisture. Farming this way, it is impossible to talk about nurturing the land. It will only make the land increasingly infertile, causing soil compaction and a decline in soil fertility, which is a form of reckless exploitation of land resources.

For a period, chemical fertilizers were in short supply, making them difficult to purchase, and in some places, there was even a frenzy to grab chemical fertilizers. The reasons for this are multifaceted. The current land use system makes farmers reluctant to invest more in increasing soil fertility. After the development of urban and rural commodity economies, farmers find that accumulating farmyard manure is time-consuming and labor-intensive, far less profitable than engaging in sideline industries. Additionally, chemical fertilizer plants are operating below capacity, imports of chemical fertilizers have decreased, and price hikes caused by the "dual-track" system all need to be addressed. More importantly, we need to do solid work. Changing the concept of "fertilizer" is also a crucial task.

As early as the 1950s, we understood agricultural modernization to mean achieving mechanization, irrigation, chemicalization, and electrification of agriculture. Chemicalization became a goal for agricultural modernization. However, this view is neither scientific nor practical. American agriculture, Danish agriculture—aren't they modernized? Why does America rely on organic fertilizers for two-thirds of its fertilizer needs? Why do they still vigorously apply manure and practice crop stalk return to the field? Why do they still highly praise China's traditional fertilization methods? These are all worth pondering. Some connoisseurs and discerning individuals understand that good tea, good fruits, and good vegetables are those that are either not fertilized with chemicals or are fertilized with as little chemicals as possible. Clearly, absolutizing chemical fertilizers is very harmful.

Producing chemical fertilizers requires oil, coal, and electricity. Given China's national conditions, it is impossible to increase chemical fertilizer production indefinitely. We should adopt a policy of prioritizing farmyard manure and combining it with chemical fertilizers. This approach not only increases yield but also nurtures the land, which is more practical than the slogan of chemicalization.

### 不应冷落农家肥

　　不应冷落农家肥
    项南
    种地要养地，种庄稼主要靠农家肥，这是我国农民多年形成的优良传统。近年来，老传统被丢掉了。种地不养地，冷落农家肥，过分依赖化肥的现象，相当普遍。
    化肥具有肥效高、见效快、使用和运输都比较方便的优点。随着化肥工业的发展，我国农民平均每亩施用化肥量，已经超过世界平均水平一倍以上，而农民对化肥的需求仍有增无减。长年累月只施化肥，不增加耕地的有机物质，不因地制宜增施厩肥、饼肥、泥炭、人粪尿，不种绿肥和秸秆还田，是很有害的。忽视有机肥，对土壤中腐殖质的增加，团粒结构的形成，微生物的繁殖，土壤的松软、通气，适度水份的保存，都是很不利的。这样种地，根本谈不上养地，只会越种越瘦，使土地板结，使地力下降，这是对地力的一种不计后果的掠夺。
    前一段时期化肥紧张，化肥难买，有些地方甚至刮起一股抢化肥之风，原因是多方面的。现时的土地使用制度使农民不愿为增加地力花费更多的投入。城乡商品经济发展后，农民感到积攒农家肥费工费时，远不如把时间用来搞工副业上算。加上化肥厂开工不足，化肥减少进口，“双轨”制引起的哄抬价格等等，确实需要整治一下，更需要做扎实的工作。改变一下“肥”的观念，也是一项很重要的工作。
    还在５０年代，我们对农业现代化就理解为实现农业的机械化、水利化、化学化和电气化。化学化成了农业现代化的一个奋斗目标。但化学化很容易给人这么一种印象，似乎施肥只有施化肥，才算现代化。
    这种观点并不科学，也不实际。美国的农业，丹麦的农业，算是现代化了吧，为何美国肥料的２／３要靠有机肥，为何至今还不遗余力地施用厩肥，大搞秸秆还田？又为何至今还十分赞赏中国的传统施肥方法？这不值得我们好好想一想吗？一些美食家和嘴刁的人很懂得，凡好喝的茶，好吃的瓜果，好吃的蔬菜，都是不施或尽量少施化肥的，可见把化肥绝对化是很有害的。
    制造化肥，要油，要煤，要电，按照中国的国情，不可能无限地增加化肥产量。我们应当采取以农家肥为主，把农家肥和化肥结合起来使用的政策。这样做，既可增产，又可养地，这比化学化的口号恐怕更实际一些。
