The Yuncheng Gold Mine in Shanxi Province is in a state of chaotic management, with widespread illegal mining activities. The financial records are in disarray, and there are significant instances of unauthorized spending, which have had a severely negative impact on the local community.

The Yuncheng Gold Mine was established in 1986 with an initial investment of over 600,000 yuan from the state. Due to rampant unauthorized spending, the investment funds were not used effectively, and the mine's equipment has not been improved. Currently, the mine still uses outdated and highly polluting amalgamation methods to extract gold. The mined ore, based on its gold content, should have yielded over 100 kilograms of gold, but the amount actually handed over to the state is less than 3,000 grams. A significant amount of gold has been smuggled out.

During an investigation before the end of last year, the reporter observed that illegal mining activities were rampant in the area. The mine's resources have been severely damaged, with most of the surface-rich ores already excavated. Some low-grade ores have been dumped along the roadsides in the valleys. Almost every household in the nearby villages has rudimentary gold refining equipment. It is understood that some individual miners have colluded with mine employees to steal and sell ores, engaging in private gold refining activities. At the height of illegal mining, hundreds of people would go up the mountain to dig for ores every day. The mine's manager, Wang Jiamu, took advantage of the chaotic management to steal and sell ores multiple times. He also set up a private account with a local farmer, Wei Zhong'an, to operate a private gold refining mill, which was recently confiscated by the Xiya Township government.

Since its establishment, the Yuncheng Gold Mine has had no financial records. It has accounts in three different banks, with four separate account numbers. The amount of funds in each account is unclear to the several mine leaders and the deputy mayor of Yuncheng City, Yang Tianzheng, who oversees this aspect. When the reporter interviewed Yang Tianzheng, he lied to the reporter, stating, "The financial management of the mine is very sound." According to the accountants, during this financial audit, Yang Tianzheng repeatedly obstructed the process. It was only recently, during the reporter's investigation, that the auditors were able to access the mine's financial records. Currently, the mine's financial records consist of five packages of vouchers, each kept by different handlers. During the recent financial audit, one package was stolen, and the other three went missing. After much effort, only one package was recovered. The audit discovered that from April 9 to May 28 last year, the Yuncheng Gold Mine made five cash withdrawals totaling 10,000 yuan using blank receipts, all given to a relative, Gu Chengxun. The former mine manager, Tong Gaocai, told the reporter that when the mine first produced gold, the gold was taken home by the mine manager for safekeeping. Several mine leaders, upon leaving their positions, did not follow proper gold handover procedures. Wang Jiamu told the reporter that the first batch of gold produced by the Yuncheng Gold Mine was all taken by Deputy Mayor Yang Tianzheng and has since disappeared. When the reporter raised this issue with Yang Tianzheng, he did not deny it and claimed that the production of gold by the Yuncheng Gold Mine was a major event, and the gold was taken for promotional purposes.

Since its establishment, the Yuncheng Gold Mine has been overseen by Deputy Mayor Yang Tianzheng, who has appointed several leaders. During the mine's construction, Yang Tianzheng arranged for his cousin, Wang Jiamu, from his hometown in Linyi County, to become the mine's manager. Some locals have questioned why local officials were not used. When asked by the reporter, Yang stated that Wang Jiamu had experience in individual gold refining at his brother's mine in Lingbao County, Henan Province. After Wang Jiamu arrived at the mine, he used Yang as his backing to marginalize other officials and engage in private gold refining activities. Last spring, during the Spring Festival, Wang Jiamu took advantage of the holiday and the absence of most mine workers to steal ores from Pingyang Village in Lingbao County, Henan Province, in the dead of night. He was caught, and the other two mine managers immediately reported the incident to Yang Tianzheng, who has yet to take any action. When the reporter interviewed the former mine manager, Tong Gaocai, he became emotional and said, "I was an engineer at the Lingbao Gold Mine in Henan Province. To support the local development and at the repeated urging of Yang Tianzheng, I came to the Yuncheng Gold Mine. I never expected Yang to support his cousin, Wang Jiamu, in using his power for personal gain, making it impossible for me to work here, so I had to change jobs." Another former mine manager told the reporter over the phone, "The Yuncheng Gold Mine has many problems. The issues I know about Yang in the mine are enough to cause him trouble." When the reporter interviewed him, he expressed fear of retaliation from Yang Tianzheng and was reluctant to speak the truth. Some officials from the Xiya Township government told the reporter, "We are afraid of retaliation from Yang Tianzheng and do not dare to report his problems in the mine. Since you reporters are investigating this matter, we will gather the courage to report it to you. We hope that the party newspaper will help us seek justice." Yang Tianzheng has written notes for the mine protection team leader to facilitate the theft and sale of ores. His actions have directly affected the mine protection team. Officer Wang Kaiji from the Nancheng Police Station, while on duty protecting the mine, pocketed over 10,000 yuan in fines.

The Yuncheng Gold Mine has exposed so many problems, and relevant officials from the Municipal Economic Commission have repeatedly reported these issues to the commission's leaders. However, the problems have not been resolved, and those who reported the issues have been retaliated against.

### 运城金矿不整顿怎么得了？

　　运城金矿不整顿怎么得了？
    本报记者  杨文道
    山西省运城金矿管理混乱，群众性乱开滥采严重，财务无帐本，违纪开支突出，在当地群众中造成极坏的影响。
    运城金矿１９８６年筹建，国家已投资６０多万元。由于违纪开支突出，投资经费没用到实处，金矿设备得不到改善，目前这家金矿仍然使用技术落后、污染严重的混汞冶炼法提取黄金。矿山已被开采的矿石，按含金量计算，少说也能生产出黄金１００公斤以上，实际上交给国家的黄金不足３０００克。大量黄金被走私了。
    去年年底前的采访中，记者在现场看到，此地乱开滥采严重，矿山资源遭破坏，表面富矿大部分被挖走，一些品位低的矿石被推倒在山涧道路两旁，附近农村差不多家家都有简陋炼金设备。据了解，一些个体采金者与金矿人员勾结，盗卖矿石，进行私下炼金活动。乱开滥采高潮时，每天都有几百人上山挖矿石。金矿负责人王甲木，乘矿山管理混乱之机曾多次盗卖矿石，还私设帐号与当地农民卫中安合作私设炼金碾，不久前才被西姚乡政府没收。
    运城金矿自筹备以来，财务一直无帐本，曾在三个银行分别设立四个帐号，每个户头存有多少资金，几任金矿领导和主管这方面工作的运城市副市长杨天桢都说不清楚。当记者采访杨天桢副市长，提到金矿财务无帐本时，杨对记者当面撒谎说：“金矿财务制度很健全”。据财会人员反映：在这次财务检查中，杨天桢副市长都多次刁难，直到最近记者采访，财务检查人员才有机会接触这家金矿的财务。目前，运城金矿的财务只有五个装有单据的包，分别由五个经手人自己保管。在最近财务检查中，其中有一个包突然被盗，其它三个也查无下落，几经周折才找回一个。检查中发现，去年４月９日至５月２８日，运城金矿就有５次以白条支出现金共１万元，给了关系户顾承勋。原金矿负责人佟高才对记者说：运城金矿初产黄金时，黄金由金矿负责人带回家中保管，几任金矿领导，调离工作时均无黄金交接手续。王甲木对记者说：运城金矿第一批生产出来的黄金全被杨天桢副市长拿走了，至今无下落。当记者向杨天桢副市长提到此事时，杨没有否认，并声称：运城金矿能炼出黄金，是一件大喜事，拿黄金是作为宣传用的。
    运城金矿从筹备时起一直由杨天桢副市长负责，几任领导都是杨物色的。建矿时，杨天桢将其在原籍临猗县农村的表弟王甲木安排来金矿当负责人。一些群众反映：运城的干部很多，为什么不用本地干部？当记者提问时，杨说：王甲木曾在河南省灵宝县金矿他哥哥处搞个体炼金，有经验。王甲木到金矿后，以杨作后台，排挤其他干部，进行私下炼金活动。去年春节，王甲木趁节日放假，矿上人少，深夜往河南省灵宝县平阳大队偷盗矿石，被发现，金矿其他两位负责人当即向杨天桢汇报，杨至今未作处理。当记者采访原金矿负责人佟高才时，他激动地说：我原在河南省灵宝金矿担任工程师，为了支援家乡建设，并在杨天桢的再三动员下才来到运城金矿，没想到杨支持其表弟王甲木在金矿以权谋私，搞得我实在无法工作，只好改行干别的。原金矿一位负责人在电话中对记者说：运城金矿的问题很多，我所掌握的杨在金矿的问题，端出来足够他喝一壶的。当记者采访他时，他表示：怕杨天桢对他打击报复，不敢接近记者说真话。西姚乡政府的一些干部对记者说：对杨天桢在金矿的问题，我们怕打击报复，不敢反映。既然你们记者采访此事，我们壮着胆子向你们反映。希望党报替我们伸张正义。杨天桢曾给护矿队负责人写条子，为盗卖矿石者开绿灯提供方便。他的所作所为对护矿队有直接影响，南城派出所干警王开基在执行护矿任务中，先后将１万多元罚款装入腰包。
    运城金矿暴露出这么多问题，市经委的有关同志曾多次向经委负责人汇报，问题不但得不到解决，反映情况的人反而受到了打击报复。
