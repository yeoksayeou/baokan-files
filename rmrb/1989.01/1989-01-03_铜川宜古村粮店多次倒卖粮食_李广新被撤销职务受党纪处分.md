    Copper River Yigu Village Grain Store Repeatedly Resells Grain; Li Guangxin Removed from Post and Disciplined

    Xinhua News Agency reports: Reporter Jing Xianfeng reports: In mid-to-late October 1988, Li Guangxin, deputy manager of the Yigu Village grain store in the urban area of Tongchuan City, Shaanxi Province, sold 15,500 kilograms of flour to illegal individual merchants, causing a shortage of grain supply for nearby residents and having a very bad impact. Recently, the Urban Area Grain Bureau and its Party Committee have decided to remove Li Guangxin from his post and give him a serious party warning. All illegal gains from the resale of flour have been confiscated.

    After investigation, on October 11, 1988, He Jinceng, husband of Chen Menghua from the Tongchuan City Urban Area Peach Garden Price-Set Grain and Oil Store, contacted a staff member of the Yigu Village grain store and found the person in charge of noodle production, Wang Baojin, to discuss purchasing flour at the price of noodles. With Li Guangxin's approval, Wang Baojin sold 5,500 kilograms of high-priced flour to He Jinceng. On October 20, He Jinceng again contacted Wang Baojin to buy flour. Wang Baojin, acting on his own, sold 5,000 kilograms of high-priced flour to He Jinceng. On October 25, they used the same method to sell a truckload of flour to speculators in society. Wang Baojin also accepted a bribe of 100 yuan from this transaction.

    Within half a month, the Yigu Village grain store resold flour three times. Except for the 2,600 kilograms that were recovered, the rest were resold at an increased price of 0.10 yuan per kilogram, earning a total of 1,290 yuan. Although the amount is not large, the nature of the problem is serious, and the public reaction is very strong. Under the supervision of the Tongchuan Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government, the Urban Area Grain Bureau and its Party Committee, while disciplining Li Guangxin, gave Wang Baojin the punishment of dismissal from public office with a one-year probationary period. The bribe he received was also confiscated. The Peach Garden Price-Set Grain and Oil Store's purchase of state-subsidized grain is illegal. The Urban Area Industrial and Commercial Bureau and the Price Bureau have decided to confiscate its illegal gains and revoke its business license.

    The Shaanxi Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission and the Provincial Supervision Bureau have issued a notice on this case to the entire province, emphasizing that in the future, no matter where such problems occur that disrupt the normal life of the people, they must be promptly investigated, seriously handled, and publicly reported. They must be dealt with one case at a time to ensure the smooth progress of the rectification and order.

　　铜川宜古村粮店多次倒卖粮食
    李广新被撤销职务受党纪处分
    本报讯  记者景险峰报道：陕西铜川市城区宜古村粮店副经理李广新１９８８年１０月中下旬向违法个体商户倒卖１．５５万公斤面粉，造成附近居民粮食供应断档脱销，影响极坏。最近，该市城区粮食局和局党委分别作出决定：给予李广新行政上撤销职务和党内严重警告处分，倒卖面粉非法所得全部没收。
    经检查，１９８８年１０月１１日，由个体经营的铜川市城区桃园议价粮油店陈孟花之夫何金成，通过宜古村粮店某职工找到该粮店加工挂面的负责人王保金协商，愿以挂面价格购买面粉，王保金请示本店主持工作的副经理李广新同意后，卖给何金成高价面粉５５００公斤。１０月２０日，何金成又找王保金买面粉。王保金自作主张，高价卖给何金成５０００公斤面粉。１０月２５日，他们又以同样手法，将一车面粉卖给社会上的投机钻营分子，王保金还从中受贿１００元。
    宜古村粮店在半个月内，先后３次倒卖面粉。除追回的２６００公斤外，其余的均以每公斤加价０．１０元倒卖，共获利１２９０元。数额虽然不算大，但问题性质严重，群众反映十分强烈。鉴此，在铜川市委、市府的督促下，该市粮食局和局党委在给宜古村粮店副经理李广新政纪党纪处分的同时，给王保金开除公职留用一年的处分。并没收其收受的贿赂。桃园议价粮油店套购国家平价粮，属于违法经营。城区工商局和物价局已决定没收其非法所得，并吊销营业执照。
    中共陕西省纪律检查委员会和省监察厅将此案通报全省，强调今后不论什么地方发生了这类破坏人民正常生活的问题，都要及时立案，严肃处理，公开报道，做到查一案治一片，以确保治理整顿的顺利进行。
