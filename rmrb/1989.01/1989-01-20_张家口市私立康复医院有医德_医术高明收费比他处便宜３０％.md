A private rehabilitation hospital in Zhangjiakou City, Hebei Province, funded by 140,000 yuan from private entrepreneur Hu Xiaosheng and staffed by 18 retired doctors, has been in operation for over four months. The hospital's fees are about 30% lower than similar institutions, yet its medical quality is excellent, making it highly popular among patients.

One patient stayed in a large hospital in the city for over 20 days, spending more than 700 yuan, but saw no improvement in their condition. After transferring to the private rehabilitation hospital and staying for another 20 days, they recovered and were discharged, spending only over 400 yuan.

To reduce the financial burden on patients, the hospital minimizes waiting times for surgeries. For example, surgeries for conditions like osteomyelitis only require a wait of three to four days, and appendicitis surgeries can be performed the same day if the patient arrives in the morning. For patients who come from afar, the hospital assigns specific doctors for their care. Recently, a patient from Inner Mongolia had 11 ribs fractured on the left side of their chest. In other hospitals in the city, a deposit of one to two thousand yuan was required for treatment. However, upon arriving at the private rehabilitation hospital, the patient was immediately admitted and received intensive care for four days and nights, turning a critical condition into a stable one. Upon discharge, the total cost was only over 700 yuan.

　　张家口市私立康复医院有医德
    医术高明收费比他处便宜３０％
    本报讯  由私营企业主胡小生筹资１４万余元、１８名离退休老医生出诊的河北省张家口市私立康复医院，开业４个多月来，收费标准比同类医院低３０％左右，医疗质量却属上乘，深受患者欢迎。
    有位患者在市内一家大医院住了２０多天院，开销７００多元，病情不见好转。到私立康复医院也住了２０多天院，只开销４００多元，就痊愈出院了。
    为了减轻患者的负担，医院尽量缩短患者手术等候时间。像骨髓炎一类的手术，只需等三四天；做阑尾炎手术上午来，下午就可以做。对慕名而来的患者，医院指定医生出诊。前不久，一位来自内蒙古的患者，左侧胸腔压断１１根肋骨，到市内别的医院就诊押金需要一两千元。来到私立康复医院后，院里当即留下住院，特护４天４夜，使患者转危为安。出院结算，仅开销７００多元。
