Soviet Union's grain production declined last year, and grain imports this year are expected to reach near-record levels.

New China News Agency, Moscow, January 16 - The first deputy chairman of the Soviet State Planning Committee, Sitarlyan, announced today at a press conference that preliminary calculations show that the Soviet Union's grain production last year was 195 million tons, a decrease of 150 million tons and 160 million tons compared to 1986 and 1987, respectively.

Local sources believe that this figure announced by the Soviet Union is even lower than the estimates made by Western experts. The U.S. Department of Agriculture had previously estimated the figure to be 205 million tons, while the Soviet Union itself set a target of 235 million tons.

According to analysts of the world grain market, the failure to meet the grain production target last year was one of the reasons for the Soviet Union's recent agreement with the United States on new grain imports. According to this agreement, the Soviet Union will continue to purchase 900 million tons of grain from the United States each year for the next two years.

New China News Agency, Beijing, January 17 - Washington Report: The head of a research institute monitoring the Soviet economy, Fan Nos, said that due to last year's poor grain harvest, the Soviet Union's grain imports this year will reach near-record levels.

According to Fan Nos' estimates, the Soviet Union's grain imports for the 1988/1989 period may reach 45 million to 50 million tons, approaching the record 55.5 million tons imported during the 1984/1985 period.

It is reported that the Soviet Union announced on the 16th that last year's grain production dropped to the lowest level in three years, estimated at 195 million tons, 40 million tons short of the government's target.

　　苏联去年粮食减产
    今年粮食进口量将接近创纪录水平
    新华社莫斯科１月１６日电  苏联国家计委第一副主席西塔良今天在记者招待会上宣布，据初步计算，苏联去年的粮食产量为１．９５亿吨，比１９８６年和１９８７年分别减产１５００万和１６００万吨。
    此间人士认为，苏联公布的这一数字甚至低于西方专家原先所估计的数字。美国农业部原先曾估计的数字为２．０５亿吨，苏联自己规定的指标为２．３５亿吨。
    据世界粮食市场的分析家认为，去年苏联粮食收成未达到指标是促使苏联去年底同美国达成新的粮食进口协议的一个原因。根据这一协议，苏联在今后两年里每年将继续从美国购买９００万吨的粮食。
    新华社北京１月１７日电　华盛顿消息：美国监视苏联经济的一研究所负责人范诺斯说，由于去年其粮食欠收，苏联今年的粮食进口量将达到接近创纪录的水平。
    据范诺斯预计，１９８８／１９８９年度苏联的粮食进口量可能达到４５００万到５０００万吨，接近１９８４／１９８５年度创纪录的５５５０万吨的进口量。
    据报道，苏联１６日宣布，去年苏联的粮食产量降到了３年来的最低点，估计为１．９５亿吨，离政府规定的目标差４０００万吨。
