On January 20, nearly a thousand young militia members and workers from Dongcheng District, Beijing, formed 25 "Support the Military and Care for Families of Soldiers Service Teams." They rode tricycles to various military units, including the Air Force Logistics Department and the Beijing Military Region General Hospital, setting up stalls and providing door-to-door services. They repaired watches, bicycles, radios, televisions, mended shoes, tailored clothes, and delivered grain, oil, and vegetables.
