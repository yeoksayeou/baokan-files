A Silk Road dating back 2,400 to 2,500 years has been discovered in the vast grasslands of northern China. This discovery was revealed to reporters by Lü Sīxián, deputy director of the Inner Mongolia Cultural Relics and Archaeology Research Institute.

Through field investigations and extensive research, Lü Sīxián and his colleagues have confirmed that the Silk Road in the grasslands, which was established during the Warring States period, consists of two routes: the southern and northern routes. The southern route starts from Liaodong, crosses the Inner Mongolia grasslands, and extends through the northern foothills of the Tian Shan Mountains in Xinjiang to Central Asia and the Middle East. In 215 BC, Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of the Qin Dynasty, returned to Xianyang via this grassland route along the northern slopes of the Yanshan and Yinshan Mountains. In recent years, archaeologists discovered Roman gold coins near the ancient road in the eastern section of the Yinshan Mountains, indicating that cultural exchanges between the East and West during the Qin and Han dynasties were quite thriving.

The northern route of the Silk Road, located at the 50th parallel north, begins at the upper reaches of the Ergun River in Heilongjiang and stretches across the Eurasian continent. Historical records and unearthed artifacts confirm that this route was once traversed by Hunnic cavalry. Later, Genghis Khan's Mongol army set out from the Hulun Buir grasslands along this route and marched towards the Mediterranean coast. Han dynasty relics, including Chinese silk products and Western woolen fabric fragments, have been found in Mongolia and Siberia, further attesting to the historical significance of this route.

Lü Sīxián stated that the discovery of the grassland Silk Road adds new dimensions to the study of Eurasian grassland history and culture.

　　我北方草原发现丝绸路
    辟于战国横贯欧亚大陆
    新华社呼和浩特１月１０日电  （记者石云子）距今两千四五百年以前，我国北方茫茫草原上曾开拓出一条丝绸之路。内蒙古文物考古研究所副所长陆思贤日前向记者透露了这一科研成果。
    经过陆思贤和他的同行实地踏看和反复调查考证，确认辟于战国时期的草原丝绸之路分为南、北两道。南道起自辽东，横越内蒙古草原，经新疆天山北麓通往中亚、西亚。公元前２１５年秦始皇东巡，曾沿着燕山、阴山北麓这条草原通道返回咸阳。前些年考古工作者在阴山东段大青山古道附近发现东罗马金币，证明秦汉时期在这里开发的中西文化交流已相当繁盛。
    位于北纬５０度的草原丝绸之路北道，以黑龙江上游额尔古纳河为起点，横贯欧亚大陆。从史籍记载与出土文物中证实，这里曾活跃过匈奴骑兵，后来成吉思汗蒙古军正是从呼伦贝尔草原出发，沿着此道奔向地中海沿岸。今蒙古人民共和国境内及西伯利亚等地陆续出土的汉代遗物中，就有中国丝绸制品和西方毛织物残片。
    陆思贤说，草原丝绸之路的发现，为研究欧亚草原历史文化增添了新的内容。
