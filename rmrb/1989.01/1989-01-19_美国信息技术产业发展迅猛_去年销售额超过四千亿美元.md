Since the 1970s, the U.S. information technology industry has been developing rapidly. According to the American Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers Association, by the end of this century, the annual revenue of the U.S. information technology industry will reach nearly $1 trillion, making it one of the largest industries in the U.S.

According to statistics from the U.S. Congress Office of Technology Assessment, the sales revenue of the information sector was $131.8 billion in 1978 and $174.4 billion in 1980. According to the American Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers Association, by 1988, the sales revenue of the U.S. information sector reached $423.7 billion. It is estimated that by 1998, this figure will increase to $864 billion, and the proportion of the information sector's revenue in the U.S. gross national product will rise from 8.7% in 1988 to over 10%.

The information technology industry includes electronic components, information processing equipment (electronic computers and office equipment, as well as related peripheral equipment and services), semiconductors, and communication equipment. Information technology has been widely applied and is increasingly influencing the production and social life of the U.S. and many other countries around the world.

To promote the development of the information technology industry, the U.S. has increased investment in this field and accelerated the training of talent.

According to the American Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers Association, since 1980, the average annual increase in research and development investment in the information technology industry has been 16.1%, higher than the average annual growth rate of research and development investment in the industrial sector (10.3%).

To meet the demand for technical talent in the information sector, the number of information technology professionals trained in universities from 1985 to 1986 increased from 7,230 in the 1973-1974 period to 50,303, an increase of 596%. From 1976 to 1988, the total number of computer experts in the U.S. increased from 116,000 to 545,000, with an average annual increase of 13.8%.

　　美国信息技术产业发展迅猛
    去年销售额超过四千亿美元
    新华社华盛顿１月１７日电  自７０年代以来，美国的信息技术产业一直在迅猛发展。据美国计算机和企业设备制造商协会最近预计，到本世纪末，美国信息技术产业的年收入额将达到近１万亿美元，从而成为美国的最大产业之一。
    据美国国会技术评价局统计，信息部门的销售额，１９７８年为１３１８亿美元，１９８０年为１７４４亿美元。据美国计算机和企业设备制造商协会最近公布，到１９８８年，美国信息部门的销售额达４２３７亿美元，预计到１９９８年将增至８６４０亿美元，信息部门的收入在美国国民生产总值中所占比重将从１９８８年的８．７％上升到１０％以上。
    信息技术产业包括电子器件、信息处理设备（电子计算机和办公室设备，以及与其有关的外围设备和服务）、半导体和通信设备。信息技术已经得到广泛应用，并且正在对美国和世界上越来越多国家的生产和社会生活产生着重要影响。
    为推动信息技术产业的发展，美国增加了在这个领域的投资和加快了人才培养。
    据美国计算机和企业设备制造商协会最近公布的资料显示，自１９８０年以来，美国用于信息技术产业方面的研究和开发投资，平均每年增加１６．１％，高于美国用在工业领域总的研究和开发投资的年均增长率（１０．３％）。
    为满足信息部门对科技人才的需求，在１９８５年至１９８６年在大学接受过专业培训的信息技术专业人员从在１９７３年至１９７４年期间的７２３０人增加到５０３０３人，增加了５９６％。从１９７６年到１９８８年，美国计算机专家总数从１１．６万人增至５４．５万人，平均每年增加１３．８％。
