During a visit to Shenzhen University, President Luo Zhengqi, when discussing educational funding, said, "I do not advocate 'splitting a coin into two halves to spend,' but rather, every penny should be used multiple times." He added, "We strive to do this, and in this regard, the school's student-run 'experimental bank' has played a significant role."

Money, once spent, is gone. How can it be used "multiple times"? When we saw a sign with the word "Bank" in the administrative building of Shenzhen University, we thought it was a branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. We never imagined it was the school's own bank.

After learning about the "experimental bank," we realized that "using every penny multiple times" is not only possible but also a good approach.

The "experimental bank" became the school's central cashier

Shenzhen University's "experimental bank" was established in November 1984 as a part of a work-study program by a few students from the Economics Department. It started with 3,000 yuan borrowed from the school. The first account holder was President Luo Zhengqi. In February 1985, the "experimental bank" was approved by the Shenzhen Branch of the People's Bank of China to operate as a credit cooperative and received a business license, but it continued to be referred to as the "experimental bank" within the school. The bank's general manager, branch managers, and clerks are all students. Initially, it only handled personal deposits and loans, but later expanded to handle the school's and various departments' fund deposits and loans, the distribution of teachers' and students' salaries, scholarships, and study grants, the advance and reimbursement of travel expenses, and the collection of rent and utility fees for teachers and students, becoming the central cashier for Shenzhen University's finances. The school's financial department's work was greatly simplified, no longer handling cash. Now, most of the funds of Shenzhen University are deposited in this bank. The bank's deposit balance has reached over 12 million yuan, with accumulated self-owned funds of over 1 million yuan and fixed assets of over 300,000 yuan.

The government allocates educational and construction funds to Shenzhen University each year, totaling over 10 million yuan, in addition to other off-budget revenues. These funds are not spent all at once. Teachers' salaries are not all used up in the current month, and the surplus needs to be saved. Therefore, a significant portion of the annual educational funds is stored in the bank for a period. Previously, these funds were deposited in external banks. Commercial banks then invested these funds back into society, earning interest, which essentially means society is using educational funds to generate interest, or even a form of "misappropriation" of educational funds. This situation exists nationwide, and the amount of educational funds misappropriated by society each year is substantial. This indicates that our educational investment efficiency is low, and educational funds are not fully utilized, which is also a drawback of the planned economic system. If we can overcome this drawback and keep these funds within the educational sector, it would be equivalent to increasing a significant amount of educational funds.

Due to the support of the "experimental bank," the construction of each dormitory building saves several hundred thousand to several million yuan compared to national funding.

The "experimental bank" mainly engages in credit business within the school. First, it supports the school in establishing school-run enterprises. In recent years, the school has borrowed several million yuan from the bank to build several school-run factories with high efficiency and quick returns, increasing the school's income. These loans, including principal and interest, have been quickly recovered. Second, the school has borrowed several million yuan for construction. Government construction funds are not allocated timely in one lump sum. If construction waits for the allocated funds, the construction period will be delayed; and with rising prices, additional funds will be needed when the allocated funds are received. The bank's loans enable timely construction, shortening the construction period and improving efficiency. Each dormitory building, due to the support of the "experimental bank," saves several hundred thousand to several million yuan compared to relying on national funding. Since its establishment, the "experimental bank" has cumulatively issued over 10 million yuan in construction loans. Shenzhen University's construction speed and investment efficiency are at the forefront of universities nationwide, which is greatly related to the establishment of the bank. President Luo said that without the "experimental bank," Shenzhen University would have difficulty establishing so many school-run enterprises in a short period, and the school's funds would be very tight.

As a financial institution, the "experimental bank" also participates in interbank fund borrowing and lending in society, with relatively high interest rates on borrowed funds. This similarly maximizes the use of educational funds and generates income for the school.

The establishment of the "experimental bank" has brought about a profound change in Shenzhen University's financial work. Since cash handling is entirely managed by the bank, the school's financial work has been greatly simplified, and the department has been significantly reduced. With nearly a thousand teachers and staff and over 4,000 students, the financial staff of Shenzhen University consists of only about a dozen people, with efficiency greatly improved. Previously, the distribution of student study grants was often not collected on time, but after being handled by the "experimental bank," all were collected on time. Previously, the distribution of teachers' and staff's salaries required a significant amount of manpower and tens of millions of yuan in cash each month. Now, each teacher and staff member has an account at the "experimental bank," and their monthly salary is transferred to their account. Teachers and staff can withdraw cash from the "experimental bank" whenever they need it, and there is no longer a concept of "salary distribution on a specific date each month." Teachers' and staff's salaries are also part of educational funds, stored as personal deposits in the experimental bank, with a deposit balance of 2 million yuan. The "experimental bank" then uses this money to support the school's education, equivalent to increasing 2 million yuan in educational funds.

The operation of the "experimental bank" shows that educational funds can indeed be used "multiple times." This will greatly improve the efficiency of educational investment. The educational sector has proposed the establishment of an "educational bank," which is undoubtedly a good idea, and Shenzhen University's "experimental bank" provides a good example.

Lastly, it is worth mentioning that an important benefit of Shenzhen University's "experimental bank" is its direct impact on talent cultivation. The bank is run by students and has been entirely operated by students since its establishment. Four branches employ nearly 40 students. The current general manager, Yao Xueqing, graduated from the Economics and Trade Department and has been working at the "experimental bank" for over two years. He said: Running the "experimental bank" as students, we have learned all the basic knowledge and skills of financial work, cultivated a "financial mindset" and professional ethics. These students, after graduation, are eagerly recruited by financial institutions in society and are very familiar with the business after starting work.

　　深圳大学有个“实验银行”
    本报记者  毕全忠
    在深圳大学采访，罗征启校长在谈到教育经费时说：“我不赞成‘一分钱掰成两瓣花’，而主张每一分钱要多用几次。”他又说：“我们是尽量这么做的，这方面，学校的学生‘实验银行’起了很大作用。”
    钱，用一次就完了，怎么还能“多用几次”？说到学生“实验银行”，我们在深圳大学办公大楼里看到过一块写着“银行”二字的牌子，以为这是工商银行在该校的营业处，没想到是本校的银行。
    当了解这个“实验银行”的情况之后，我们就明白“每一分钱要多用几次”，不仅是可能的，而且是个好办法。
    　　　　“实验银行”成了全校财务的总出纳
    深圳大学“实验银行”成立于１９８４年１１月，当时是经济系几名学生作为勤工俭学的一项活动开办的。它以向学校借来的３０００元钱作为自有资金起家。第一个存款户头，便是罗征启校长。１９８５年２月，“实验银行”被中国人民银行深圳支行批准作为一个信用社营业，并领到了营业执照，但校内仍称它为“实验银行”。银行的总经理、各营业处经理和营业员，都由学生担任。开始，只办理个人存款和借贷，后来扩展到办理学校及校内各部门的资金存款和借贷、发放全校教职工工资和学生贷学金奖学金、差旅费预支和报销、师生房租与水电费的收缴等，成了深圳大学财务的总出纳。学校财务部门的工作由此大大简化，不再经手现金。现在，深圳大学的大部分资金都存到了这个银行，行里的存款余额达１２００多万，已积累自有资金１００多万元，固定资产３０多万元。
    政府每年按计划拨给深圳大学的教育事业费和基建费共有一千几百万元，此外，学校还有其它计划外收入。这些钱，并不是立即一次用完的。教职工的工资也不都是当月用完的，结余部分要储蓄。因此，每年的教育经费有相当一部分，要在银行存一段时间。以前，这些钱都存在校外的银行。社会上的银行又把这笔钱投放到社会上去使用、生息，实际上是社会占用教育经费去生息，甚至可以说是一种变相的“挪用”教育经费。这种情况全国都存在，算起来，每年被社会占用的教育经费数量相当庞大。这表明，我们的教育投资效益低，教育经费没有充分利用，这也是计划经济体制造成的一个弊病。如果能克服这一弊病，使这笔钱仍然用于教育事业，就等于增加了不少教育经费。
    　　　　由于“实验银行”支援，每建一座宿舍比国家拨款节省几万甚至十
    　　几万元
    “实验银行”主要在校内开展信贷业务。首先是支援学校开办校办企业。这几年，学校向银行借款几百万元，建成了几个效益高、收效快的校办厂，为学校增加了收入。这些贷款连本带利，很快就收了回来。其次是学校基建借款，也有几百万元。政府拨给学校的基建费并不是及时、一次拨给的。如果等基建拨款来后再施工，工期就要拖长；而物价在不断上涨，等到拨款拿到，就要追加资金。“实验银行”的借款，使工程及时进行，缩短了工期，提高了效益。每建一座宿舍楼，由于得到“实验银行”的支援，要比靠国家拨款节省几万甚至十几万元。“实验银行”开办以来，累计向学校投放基建贷款１０００多万元。深圳大学建校的速度和投资效益居全国各校之首，这与银行的开办有很大关系。罗校长说，深圳大学如果没有“实验银行”，很难在短期内建成那么多的校办企业，学校经费将非常紧张。
    作为一个金融机构，“实验银行”也参与社会上的同行资金拆借，拆出的资金利息较高。这同样也是充分利用教育经费，为学校生息。
    　　　　教职工不在乎“每月几号发工资”，用钱便到银行支取
    “实验银行”的开办，使深圳大学的财务工作发生了深刻的变革。由于现金出纳完全由银行办理，学校财务工作大大简化，机构大大缩小。近千名教职工、４０００多名学生的深大，财务工作人员仅十来个人，效率大为提高。以前，发放学生贷学金，总不能按期收回，由“实验银行”办理后，全部及时收回。以前，每月发放教职工工资，需投入不少人力，要二三十万元现金。现在，每个教职工在“实验银行”都有个存款户头，每月工资转入每人的户头。教职工什么时候要用现金，都可以到“实验银行”支取，已没有“每月几号发工资”的概念。教职工工资也是教育经费的一部分，作为个人存款存在实验银行，存款余额已达２００万元。“实验银行”又把这笔钱用于支援学校办学，等于增加了２００万元的教育经费。
    “实验银行”的运作，说明教育经费是可以做到“每一分钱多用几次”的。这将大大提高教育投资的效益。教育界已经提出设立“教育银行”的建议，这无疑是好设想，深圳大学“实验银行”就提供了很好的证明。
    　　　　参加过银行工作的学生毕业后，金融机构抢着聘用
    最后，还应补充一点，即深圳大学“实验银行”带来的重要效益，是它对人才培养的直接作用。银行是由学生办起来的，至今也全部由学生组成。四个营业处，聘用了近４０名学生。现任总经理姚学清刚从经贸系毕业，已在“实验银行”工作了二年多。他说：学生办“实验银行”，学到了金融工作的全部基本知识和技能，养成了“金融头脑”和职业道德。这些学生毕业后，社会上的金融机构抢着聘用，工作后对业务非常熟悉。
