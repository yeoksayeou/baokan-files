Our country's grain post-harvest losses are severe. Experts suggest paying attention to post-harvest technology development.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, January 7th - (Reporters Tang Qingzhong, intern Shen Haixiong) According to Associate Professor He Yinsheng of Zhejiang Agricultural University, "China's grain post-harvest losses are very severe. Taking Zhejiang as an example, the province produces approximately 17 billion kilograms of grain annually, but post-harvest losses are at least 2.5 billion kilograms."

To understand the situation of grain post-harvest losses, the Zhejiang Provincial Agricultural Product Post-Harvest Technology Research and Development Center organized relevant research institutions and university experts and professors to form an agricultural post-harvest research team. They conducted a survey on grain post-harvest losses. The survey found that there are different degrees of losses at each stage of grain post-harvest, accounting for the following proportions of total production: harvesting losses 1% to 3%, threshing losses 2% to 4%, drying losses 1% to 3%, storage losses 4% to 8%, transportation losses 1% to 2%, and initial processing losses 2% to 5%. The comprehensive post-harvest loss rate is 11% to 25%.

Experts believe that the causes of grain post-harvest losses are multifaceted, such as outdated harvesting, threshing, drying, transportation, storage, and processing equipment, as well as dispersed operations. All of these are related to the lack of attention given to grain post-harvest technology research, development, and application. They propose that the following steps be taken currently:

First, promote simple and effective post-harvest technologies. In the drying, storage, and processing stages, take corresponding measures. In drying, promote the short-term protection technology for wet grains. Zhejiang Agricultural University is developing simple grain drying equipment, using agricultural waste as fuel, which can dry over a ton of rice per day at a low cost, suitable for ordinary farmers to use. In grain storage, it is necessary to change the practice of bagging, binning, and random indoor stacking, and promote cement silos to prevent rodent damage. In processing, obsolete or high-breaking rate rice milling machines should be eliminated or improved, and processing personnel should be trained in technology to change from single "whitening" (milling) to double "whitening." It is also possible to promote "combined rice milling machines" to reduce the breaking rate.

Second, guide farmers to gradually implement scale management to create conditions for the use of more advanced post-harvest technologies.

Third, change the chaotic situation in grain operations to reduce unnecessary losses during the grain flow process as much as possible.

Fourth, strengthen publicity in this area. It is necessary to make relevant departments pay attention to grain post-harvest technology development and research, and also to make the general public consciously take measures to reduce grain post-harvest losses.

### 我国粮食收获加工损失严重  专家建议重视产后技术开发

　　我国粮食收获加工损失严重
    专家建议重视产后技术开发
    新华社杭州１月７日电  （记者唐庆忠、实习生慎海雄）据浙江农业大学副教授何泳生介绍：“我国粮食产后损失十分严重。以浙江为例，全省年产粮食约１７０亿公斤，而产后损失至少在２５亿公斤左右。”
    为了摸清粮食产后损失情况，浙江省农产品产后技术研究开发中心组织有关科研单位、高等院校的专家、教授，组成农业产后课题调查组，对粮食产后损失情况进行了调查。调查发现，粮食产后各个环节都有不同程度的损失，分别占总产量的比例为：收割损失１％至３％，脱粒损失２％至４％，干燥损失１％至３％，储藏损失４％至８％，运输损失１％至２％，初加工损失２％至５％。产后综合损失率为１１％至２５％。
    专家们认为，造成粮食产后损失的原因是多方面的，诸如收割、脱粒、干燥、运输、储藏、加工设备简陋，再加上作业分散等等，这些都同粮食产后技术研究、开发和应用没有得到重视有关。他们提出，当前可从以下几个方面着手：
    一、推行简易有效的产后技术。在干燥、储藏、加工三个环节上采取对策。在干燥方面，可推广湿谷短期保护技术。浙江农业大学正在研制粮食简易干燥设备，利用农业废弃物作燃料，一天可烘干稻谷一吨多，成本较低，适宜于普通农户使用。在粮食储藏方面，必须改变袋装、囤装以及室内随意堆放的做法，推广水泥砌柜，以防鼠害。在加工方面，应淘汰或改进碎米率高的碾米机，并对加工人员进行技术培训，变一次“出白”（出米）为二次“出白”。还可推广“联合米机”，降低碎米率。
    二、引导农民逐步实行规模经营，为采用较先进的产后技术创造条件。
    三、改变粮食经营中的混乱现象，尽量减少粮食流通过程中不应有的损失。
    四、加强这方面的宣传工作，既要使有关部门重视粮食产后技术开发和研究工作，也要让广大群众自觉采取措施，尽量减少粮食产后损失。
