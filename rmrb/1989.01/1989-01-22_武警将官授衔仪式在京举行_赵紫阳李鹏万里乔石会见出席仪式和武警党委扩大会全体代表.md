We believe that through this conferring of ranks on senior officers of the People's Armed Police, it will further enhance the sense of honor and responsibility among all officers of the People's Armed Police, further inspire the revolutionary heroic spirit of devotion to the cause of the People's Armed Police, and bring glory to the ranks and the national emblem.
