In the tide of reform, the correctness or incorrectness of a leader's decisions affects the fate of the cause and the well-being of the people. At the age of 46, after graduating from university, Cong Fukuai has been practicing as the mayor of Qiqihar for two years and as the secretary of the municipal party committee for one year. He often uses decision-making consciousness and thinking methods imbued with the spirit of the times, placing decision-making actions and decision-making work on the scales of seeking truth from facts, verifying whether they conform to the interests of the Party and the people, and striving for optimization.

		Not Using "Short-Term Behavior" to Gain Votes

Qiqihar, known as the "City of Cranes," has had four mayors and three secretaries in four years. It seems that this is a place for officials to be promoted.

In 1985, Cong Fukuai, then 43 years old and the mayor of Jixi, came to Qiqihar alone to serve as the acting mayor. Well-wishers advised Cong Fukuai: propose plans to build more buildings, repair more roads, and solve all the welfare facilities in the city, and votes would come flying in like snowflakes. Cong Fukuai had his own ideas. He worked day and night, visiting government offices, factories, villages, and schools, covering all seven districts and eleven counties in the city within two months, and obtaining firsthand materials. He began to conceive various ideas and plans.

In March 1986, the municipal People's Congress was held, and Cong Fukuai laid out his thoughts completely. He said: "Buildings need to be built, roads need to be repaired, and production needs to be carried out, but currently our city is poor and backward, with a fiscal deficit. The urgent task is to quickly develop productive forces, especially to develop local industries, so as to accumulate strength for the city. Otherwise, everything will be a 'blank check'!" He paused and continued, "I would rather bear the blame of not being understood for the time being than use 'short-term behavior' to gain personal votes!"

In the three years since Cong Fukuai took office, he has allocated over 100 million yuan from the fiscal budget for the renovation, transformation, and expansion of local industries, which is ten times that of the "Sixth Five-Year Plan" period. The total investment for transformation is 9.7 billion yuan, more than twice that of the "Sixth Five-Year Plan" period. In three years, the industrial profits of the municipal local budget have developed rapidly. The city has shed the hat of fiscal deficit. People have begun to truly understand this mayor's pursuit.

Cong Fukuai did not make any promises to the citizens, but as the local finances became more robust, he allocated a portion each year to renovate the city and improve people's lives. In three years, he solved 47 major issues for the people, widened the Bouqi Street, paved 1170,000 square meters of asphalt roads in the urban area, doubling the original amount, and new residential districts with complete facilities appeared. Cultural, educational, and health services also developed rapidly.

		Two Decisions Turn "Stones" into "Gold"

In Qiqihar, there is a story about the mayor turning "stones" into "gold."

The "City of Cranes" has long been burdened with two "giant stones." One is that there are many large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises in the urban area that rarely contribute taxes and profits to the local government, while the municipal finance provides living subsidies and other expenses for them, amounting to 60 million yuan annually. The second is that out of the eleven counties under its jurisdiction, ten rely on subsidies to survive, with the state providing 400 million yuan in subsidies annually, and the municipal finance contributing another 140 million yuan. These two "giant stones" weigh heavily on the leaders' minds.

Cong Fukuai conducted investigations and research in large enterprises and rural areas, using dialectical methods to analyze comprehensively, and in the combination of practice and theory, he found the answer to resolving the contradictions.

There are 54 large and medium-sized enterprises in the urban area, with a concentration of talent, advanced technology, complete equipment, and abundant funds, having 30% of surplus processing capacity. The eleven counties in the city are crisscrossed by rivers, with fertile land and vast grasslands. There are also more than 20 kinds of rare mineral resources such as pearl rock, agate, and mica. Soon, two decisions of strategic value were born:

Leveraging the advantages of large enterprises to develop township enterprises with "big leading small"; utilizing resource advantages to promote urban-rural integration, pushing the heavy industrial city towards light industrialization.

The two decisions turned "stones" into "gold," and the township enterprises and small enterprises in the city gradually emerged from the predicament of "not being able to eat their fill," regaining vitality. According to statistics at the end of 1988, the township enterprises in the city increased by more than 3,000 compared to 1985, with a net increase in profits of 100 million yuan, an average annual increase of 40.8%, doubling that of 1985. The net increase in taxes and profits was more than 100 million yuan, with an average annual increase of 24.2%. The heavy and light industries in the "City of Cranes" have developed from the previous 7:3 ratio to the favorable ratio of 6:4.

		The Elbow Should Be Turned Outward

On August 16, 1988, the second major flood in the history of the Nenjiang River roared in, with the floodwaters threatening the national important transportation artery—the Binzhou Railway and the two highways connecting Qiqihar to the northern economic zone. Either the dikes would be breached to release the floodwaters, sacrificing the railway, or the dikes would be raised to protect the railway, sacrificing the highways. The situation was urgent, and a decision had to be made immediately. Cong Fukuai, the secretary of the municipal party committee and the commander-in-chief of the flood control, decisively decided to raise the dikes and protect the railway. Manpower and resources were quickly concentrated in the flood release area, and soldiers and civilians fought day and night. The railway was finally saved, and the trains ran smoothly. However, the floodwaters destroyed the Qi-Gan and Qi-Fu highways.

Afterward, some cadres did not understand Cong Fukuai's decision. If the railway is destroyed, the state will pay to repair it, but if the highways are destroyed, the local finance will have to "dig into its pockets." Isn't this turning the elbow outward? Cong Fukuai said, "The interruption of the two highways for half a month caused a loss of 30 million yuan to the entire city, but the Binzhou Railway earned 3 billion yuan for the state in half a month."

In the more than three years since Cong Fukuai came to Qiqihar, whenever there was a conflict between the overall situation and the local situation, he made the correct choice.

During the firefighting and disaster relief in the Greater Khingan Mountains, Cong Fukuai mobilized all sectors of the city to contribute manpower and materials, sparing no effort to contribute to firefighting.

In 1988, Qiqihar suffered severe waterlogging and flooding. Cong Fukuai did not haggle with the state but instead traveled between the fields, dialoguing with county officials and farmers, mobilizing everyone to strive to complete the grain procurement task of 840,000 tons to safeguard the overall situation.

		Catching the Opportunity Brought by the "Big Climate"

After the Third Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, the thoughts of the party and government cadres in Qiqihar became unprecedentedly active. After several discussions at the municipal party committee standing committee, Cong Fukuai gathered wisdom and made a profound summary: rectification and regulation must be done with pain and sacrifice, but we must see that the "big climate" has brought us, a city mainly based on raw material industries, a precious opportunity to develop the local economy. Therefore, we must combine pressure and preservation, both eliminating economic overheating and maintaining a reasonable development speed.

After this decision was made public, it was not immediately recognized by people from all walks of life. There had been both public and private advice or criticism. Cong Fukuai promptly organized the municipal party committee standing committee members and mayors to have dialogues in various systems according to their divisions. At the municipal party and government meeting, he told the cadres: "From a national perspective, the economic growth rate is indeed too fast and needs to be controlled. However, our city's industrial average growth rate was only 1.5% from 1960 to 1980 over more than 20 years, and it was less than 9% on average after 1981, and this year it can only reach 5%. If we restrict it in sync with the 'super-high-speed' zone, the city's economy will shrink, and what's the point of talking about enhancing the ability to withstand price and wage reforms?"

Basic construction projects consistent with the state's investment direction, such as raw materials, energy, and socially needed consumer goods industries, were identified as must-preserve projects.

Cong Fukuai deeply understood that if the rectification and regulation work were not grasped firmly and resolutely, the development of the local economy would also lose its guarantee. Therefore, he personally presided over the formulation of 11 hard and fast decisions for cleaning up and rectifying, and significant results were achieved in less than two months. Recently, when Sun Weiben, the secretary of the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee, inspected work in Qiqihar, he praised Qiqihar's rectification and regulation work for being swift, stable, and effective.

　　在实事求是的“天平”上
    ——记齐齐哈尔市委书记丛福奎
    李青　吴晓东　潘广韬
    在改革大潮中，领导者的决策正确与错误，关系到事业的兴衰，人民的冷暖。大学毕业年仅４６岁的丛福奎，在齐齐哈尔市任两年市长、一年市委书记的实践中，每每运用具有时代精神的决策意识和思维方法，把决策行动和决策工作，放在实事求是的“天平”上，检验它是否符合党和人民利益，以求得优化。
    　　　　不用“短期行为”争选票
    俗有“鹤城”之称的齐齐哈尔市，４年换了四任市长、三任书记。似乎这里是干部升迁的“宝地”。
    １９８５年，４３岁的鸡西市长丛福奎，孤身一人到齐齐哈尔市任代理市长。好心人帮丛福奎出谋划策：抛出多建楼、多修路、多解决全市福利设施的方案，选票就会像雪片一样飘来。丛福奎自有主意，他日夜兼程深入机关、工厂、农村、学校，在两个月里跑了全市７个区、１１个县，掌握了第一手材料，心里萌生出一个个设想和方案。
    １９８６年３月，市人民代表大会召开了，丛福奎把自己的想法全盘托出。他说：“楼要建，路要修，生产还要搞，但眼下我市贫穷落后，财政亏空，当务之急是尽快地发展生产力，尤其是把地方工业搞上去，才能为城市积攒后劲，否则，一切都是‘空头支票’！”他顿了顿接着说，“我宁愿承担人们暂时不理解的指责，也决不用‘短期行为’为个人争选票！”
    丛福奎任职三年来，硬是从财政拨出１亿多元用于地方工业更新改造和扩建，是“六五”期间的１０倍，改造总投资９．７亿元，是“六五”期间的两倍多。三年来，全市地方预算内工业利润迅速发展。甩掉了财政亏空的落后帽子。人们开始真正理解这位市长的追求。
    丛福奎虽然没有向市民许愿，但随着地方财政的充实，他每年都拿出一部分改造城市，改善人民生活。三年时间为群众解决了４７件生活大事，拓宽了卜奎大街，铺修市区柏油马路１１７万平方米，比原来增加了１倍，一栋栋配套齐全的生活小区出现了，文化、教育、卫生事业也得到快速发展。
    　　　　两项决策点“石”成“金”
    在齐齐哈尔市，传说着市长点“石”成“金”的故事。
    “鹤城”身上长年压着两块“巨石”。一是市区内国家直属大中型企业众多，很少向当地上缴税利，而市财政每年将为其提供生活补贴等项费用，高达６０００万元之多；二是市辖１１个县有１０个县靠补贴过日子，每年国家补贴４０００万元，市财政还要拿出１４００万元。两块“巨石”压在领导者心头。
    丛福奎到大企业和农村调查研究，用辩证法全面分析，在实践和理论结合中，他找到了化解矛盾的答案。
    市区内有５４家大中企业，人才聚集、技术先进、设备齐全、资金雄厚，有３０％的剩余加工能力。全市１１个县江河纵横、土地肥沃、草原广阔。还有珍珠岩、玛瑙、麦饭石等２０多种稀有的矿产资源。很快，两项具有战略价值的决策诞生了：
    借助大企业优势，以大带小发展乡镇企业；发挥资源优势，以城带乡，城乡结合，推动重型城市向轻型化发展。
    两项决策点“石”成“金”，全市乡镇企业和小企业逐步从“吃不饱”的困境中解脱出来，重获生机。据１９８８年末统计，市乡镇企业比１９８５年增加３０００多个，净增利润１亿元，平均每年递增４０．８％，比１９８５年翻了一番。净增税利１亿多元，平均每年递增２４．２％。“鹤城”重轻工业由过去的７∶３，已发展到６∶４的可喜比值。
    　　　　胳膊肘该往外拐还得拐
    １９８８年８月１６日，嫩江历史上的第二次特大洪峰咆哮而来，洪水紧逼国家重要交通命脉——滨洲铁路和齐齐哈尔通往北部经济区的两条公路。要么扒堤泄洪舍掉铁路，要么加高大堤牺牲公路。情况紧急，需立即决策。市委书记、抗洪总指挥丛福奎，果断做出加高大堤，力保铁路的决策，人力、物力迅速集中到泄洪区，军民昼夜奋战，铁路终于保住了，列车畅通无阻。但洪水却冲垮了齐甘、齐富两条公路。
    事后，有些干部对丛福奎这项决策不理解。铁路冲断国家拿钱修，公路毁了，地方财政要“掏腰包”，这不是胳膊肘往外拐吗？为此，丛福奎说，两条公路中断半个月，全市损失３０００万元，可滨洲铁路这半个月就为国家增收３个亿。
    丛福奎到齐齐哈尔三年多来，每当全局和局部发生矛盾时，他都做出了正确的抉择。
    在大兴安岭扑火救灾中，丛福奎动员全市各界出人、出物资，不惜一切代价为扑火贡献力量。
    １９８８年，齐齐哈尔涝灾、洪灾严重。丛福奎没有向国家讨价还价，而是奔波于阡陌之间，与县里的干部、农民对话，动员大家力争完成８４万吨粮食征购任务，以保全局。
    　　　　抓住“大气候”带来的机遇
    十三届三中全会后，齐齐哈尔党政机关干部思想空前活跃。经过市委常委会的几次争论，丛福奎集思广益，做出精辟的总结：治理和整顿一定要忍痛割爱，但要看到，“大气候”给我们这个以原材料工业为主的城市，带来发展地方经济的宝贵机遇。因此，要保压结合，既消除经济过热，又要保持合理的发展速度。
    这项决策亮相后，并没有马上被各阶层人士承认，公开或私下都曾有过劝告或非议。丛福奎及时组织市委常委和市长们按分工到各系统对话。在市党政机关大会上，他向干部们说：就全国讲，经济增长速度过快，确实需要控制。然而，我市从１９６０年到１９８０年２０多年间，工业平均增长速度仅有１．５％，１９８１年后平均不到９％的速度，今年只能达到５％。如果我们同“超高速”区同步限制，全市经济就会萎缩，还谈什么增强对价格、工资改革的承受力？
    同国家投资方向一致的原材料、能源及社会急需的消费品工业等基础建设，被确定为必保项目。
    丛福奎深知，如果治理和整顿工作抓得不实不狠，发展地方经济也将失去保障。因此，他同市长亲自主持制定了１１条硬性清理整顿的决定，不到两个月，已取得明显效果。不久前，黑龙江省委书记孙维本到齐市检查工作时，赞扬齐齐哈尔市治理整顿工作行动快，步子稳，成效大。
