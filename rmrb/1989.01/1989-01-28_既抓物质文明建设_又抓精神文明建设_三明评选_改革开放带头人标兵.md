	Both Material and Spiritual Civilization Construction Are Emphasized
	Three-Min City Selects "Reform and Opening-Up Pioneers"

	BEIJING, Jan. 28 (Xinhua) -- Some people asked those from Sanming City, Fujian Province, who were traveling to other places: Does Sanming still promote spiritual civilization? The reporter recently learned that Sanming City, while pushing forward reform and opening-up, has been steadfastly promoting spiritual civilization construction. A preliminary situation of mutual promotion, penetration, and synchronous development between material and spiritual civilization construction has been formed.

	The Sanming Municipal Committee believes that "the more reform and opening-up, the more spiritual civilization construction should be strengthened." Therefore, last year, Sanming's spiritual civilization construction took new steps under the new situation.

	The entire city launched the "Be a Sanming Person in Reform and Opening-Up" activity. Various industries selected and commended "Reform and Opening-Up Pioneer Models." The number of participants reached over ten million, and the masses directly voted to select 10 "Reform and Opening-Up Pioneer Models" and 20 "Reform and Opening-Up Pioneers."

	The Sanming Municipal Committee, in response to the new situation of commodity economy development, conducted clean governance education in party and government organs and formulated specific regulations. Law enforcement agencies such as judicial administration, industry and commerce, taxation, finance, auditing, and pricing, on the basis of improving the post responsibility system, generally implemented card-hanging and certificate-wearing services.

	Starting from the beginning of last year, Sanming City successively held 10 sessions of leadership cadre training classes, training over 90% of section-level cadres, uniformly studying basic knowledge of export-oriented economy, relevant policies and regulations, and foreign affairs discipline. Various units also organized full-staff training according to the characteristics of their respective industries, improving the ideological and moral quality and professional quality of the staff. The First Hospital of the city established a voluntary guidance system.

　　既抓物质文明建设　又抓精神文明建设    
    三明评选“改革开放带头人标兵”
    本报讯  新华社记者王永平报道：有人问福建三明市到外地出差的人：三明还搞精神文明吗？记者最近了解到，三明市在改革开放中仍坚定不移地抓精神文明建设，这里初步形成了物质文明建设与精神文明建设相互促进、相互渗透、同步发展的局面。
    三明市委认为，“越是改革开放，越是要加强精神文明建设”。由此，去年，三明市精神文明建设在新形势下又迈出了新步伐。
    全市开展了“做改革开放的三明人”活动。评选、表彰了各行各业“改革开放带头人标兵”。参加人数达十多万，群众直接投票评选出１０名“改革开放带头人标兵”，２０名“改革开放带头人”。
    三明市委针对商品经济发展的新情况，在党政机关开展了为政清廉教育，并制订了具体规定。政法、工商、税务、金融、审计、物价等执法职能机关，在完善岗位责任制的基础上，普遍实行挂牌、戴证服务。
    从去年年初开始，三明市先后举办了１０期领导干部培训班，轮训了９０％以上的处科级干部，统一学习外向型经济的基本知识、有关政策法规、外事纪律。各单位也分别根据本行业的特点，分期分批开展全员培训，提高职工的思想道德素质和业务素质；市第一医院建立了义务导诊制度。
