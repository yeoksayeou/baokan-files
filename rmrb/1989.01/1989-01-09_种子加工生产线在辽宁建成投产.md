A seed processing production line has recently been built and put into operation in Dawa County, Liaoning Province.

This seed processing line was funded with a $3.2 million loan from the World Bank by the Ministry of Agriculture, supplemented with 30 million yuan in domestic funds, and imported from West Germany. This production line operates 24 hours a day and can process 18,000 tons of seeds annually. Since March 1987, when it began trial operations, the seeds processed have shown an increase in yield of 3% to 10% per mu and a savings of 1 kilogram of rice seeds per mu. The national scientific research departments have certified that its germination rate, purity, and cleanliness all meet the national first-grade seed standards.

　　种子加工生产线在辽宁建成投产
    据新华社沈阳电  我国种子加工生产线，最近在辽宁省大洼县建成投产。
    这个种子加工生产线是农业部从世界银行贷款三百二十万美元，利用国内配套资金三百万元，从联邦德国引进的。这条种子生产线全天作业，年加工种子量达一万八千吨。从一九八七年三月开始调试生产，加工的种子经过试种表明：每亩增产百分之三至百分之十，每亩节约稻种一公斤。国家科研部门鉴定：其发芽率、纯度、净度等各项指标均达到国家一级种子标准。
