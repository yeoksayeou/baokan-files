Canada officially began investigating Ben Johnson's use of performance-enhancing drugs at the Seoul Olympics on January 11. The entire investigation is estimated to take at least 8 months, and the scope of the investigation is not limited to Ben Johnson alone but also includes all amateur and professional athletes in Canada who have illegally used performance-enhancing drugs.

The investigation is led by Judge Charles Dubin, appointed by the Canadian federal government. Over the past three months, the committee led by Dubin has collected a large amount of evidence, and relevant officials have conducted investigations in various parts of Canada and other countries.

It is reported that the formal investigation will be conducted in three stages. The first stage will mainly present background materials related to the organization and drug testing system. The second stage will summon relevant witnesses, including government sports officials and four weightlifters who were disqualified from participating in the Seoul Olympics due to drug use. The third stage will mainly investigate the Canadian track and field team, Ben Johnson, and his coach, Charlie Francis. It is said that Carl Lewis will attend to testify. Another key figure in the investigation is Johnson's sports doctor, George Astafan, who has returned to his clinic in the Caribbean island of St. Kitts. He stated that unless the Canadian government provides the funds, he will not accept the investigation.

Ben Johnson has consistently maintained that he never intentionally took drugs, and he swears to return to the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. Some sports fans in Canada and Jamaica also tend to believe that Johnson is an innocent person.

According to another report, Richard Pound, the vice-chairman of the International Olympic Committee and a Canadian lawyer, has proposed that, given the serious problem of drug abuse in the international weightlifting community, the Olympics should suspend weightlifting competitions. However, the recent meeting of the International Olympic Committee on this matter did not reach a consensus and did not make a decision.

　　加拿大正式调查约翰逊服药事件
    本报讯  记者郭文福、仓立德报道：加拿大政府１月１１日正式开始调查本·约翰逊在汉城奥运会服用兴奋剂的事件。整个调查工作估计将历时至少８个月，调查范围也不只是本·约翰逊一人，还包括加拿大所有业余和专业运动员非法服用兴奋剂的情况。
    调查工作由加拿大联邦政府指定的法官查尔斯·杜宾主持。在过去的３个月里，以杜宾为首的委员会已收集了大量的证据，有关官员已到加拿大各地和其它国家调查。
    据透露，正式调查工作将分３个阶段进行，第一阶段主要提出有关组织和服药检查制度的背景材料。第２阶段传讯有关证人，其中包括政府的体育官员和因服药而被取消参加汉城奥运会资格的４名举重选手。第三阶段主要调查加拿大田径队、本·约翰逊和他的教练弗兰西斯。据说卡尔·刘易斯将出席作证。调查的另一位关键人物是约翰逊的运动医生乔治·阿斯塔凡，他已返回在加勒比群岛圣基茨的诊所。他表示，除非加拿大政府提供费用，否则他不会接受调查。
    本·约翰逊至今仍一直坚持说他从未有意服过药，他发誓要重返１９９２年巴塞罗那奥运会。加拿大和牙买加一些体育迷们也倾向于认为约翰逊是一个无辜的人。
    另据报道，国际奥委会副主席、加拿大律师理查德·庞德已提议，鉴于国际举重界滥用药物问题十分严重，奥运会应暂停举重比赛。但前不久召开的国际奥委会有关会议上，对此没有取得一致意见，也没有作出决议。
