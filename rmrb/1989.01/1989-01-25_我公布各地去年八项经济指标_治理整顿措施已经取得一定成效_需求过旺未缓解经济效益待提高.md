Today, the State Statistical Bureau released eight major economic indicators for 1988 in various regions of China (details on the second page). This is the first time such information has been published in China, marking the formal establishment of a system where the State Statistical Bureau, State Planning Commission, Ministry of Finance, and the People's Bank of China jointly publish eight key economic indicators for each region (excluding Taiwan Province) on a monthly and quarterly basis.

According to the analysis of the eight indicators released today for 1988, the central government's measures for economic rectification and adjustment have achieved some success. However, the problems of economic overheating and excessive demand have not been alleviated. In 1988, the total fixed asset investment completed by state-owned enterprises increased by 18.8% compared to 1987. The total wage bill for workers nationwide increased by 22.1%, setting a record high since the 1960s. Industrial economic efficiency remains unsatisfactory, particularly with the overrun of comparable product costs reaching 12.3%, the highest since the founding of the nation.

Zhang Sài, Director of the State Statistical Bureau, explained the release of these eight important economic indicators. He said that the State Council established this statistical release system in response to a serious problem in China's economic development: long-term economic overheating and excessive demand have led to noticeable inflation. These eight economic indicators reflect the dynamic situation of social demand and economic efficiency in various regions from a macro perspective. Regularly publishing these indicators can, first of all, timely reflect the effectiveness of rectification, adjustment, reform, and the existing problems, providing reliable information for national macro-control. Secondly, this is an important measure to strengthen the macro-supervision system, which is conducive to enhancing the macro-control functions of planning, finance, and banking departments, and fully playing the supervisory roles of finance, banking, and statistics. At the same time, these important economic indicators, when made public through news media, increase the transparency of economic life, enabling the public to understand the economic development situation and participate in the supervision of major national economic activities.

Zhang Sài also introduced that the collection and provision of data and information for the eight indicators are divided among the finance, banking, and statistics departments, with the State Statistical Bureau ultimately compiling and publishing the information jointly.

　　我公布各地去年八项经济指标    
    治理整顿措施已经取得一定成效    
    需求过旺未缓解经济效益待提高
    本报北京１月２４日讯  记者朱剑红报道：今天，国家统计局公布了１９８８年我国各地区的８项重要经济指标（详见第二版）。这在我国是首次公布，它标志着由国家统计局、国家计委、财政部和中国人民银行联合建立的按月按季公布各地区（不包括台湾省）８项重要经济指标的制度正式生效。
    根据今天公布的１９８８年８项指标分析，中央关于治理整顿的各项措施虽然取得一定成效，但经济过热、需求过旺的问题没有缓解。１９８８年全民所有制单位固定资产投资完成额比１９８７年又增长１８．８％，全国职工工资总额比１９８７年增长２２．１％，职工工资增长幅度为６０年代以来最高纪录。工业经济效益仍不甚理想，尤其是可比产品成本的超支幅度高达１２．３％，成为建国以来的最高纪录。
    国家统计局局长张塞就此次发布８项重要经济指标作了说明。他说，国务院建立这一统计发布制度是鉴于我国经济发展中存在一个严重的问题，即由于多年来的经济过热、需求过旺，导致了明显的通货膨胀。这８项经济指标从宏观上反映了各地区社会需求和经济效益的动态情况。定期公布这些指标，首先可以及时反映治理、整顿、调整、改革的成效及存在的问题，为国家宏观调控提供可靠信息。其次这是加强宏观监督体系的一项重要措施，有利于强化计划、财政、银行等部门的宏观控制职能，充分发挥财政、银行、统计的监督作用。同时，这些重要经济指标通过新闻媒介公之于众，增强了经济生活的透明度，便于人民群众了解经济发展的情况，参与对国家重大经济活动的监督。
    张塞还介绍说，８项指标数据、信息的采集、提供是采取财政、银行、统计部门分工负责的办法，最后由国家统计局汇集、整理，联名公布。
