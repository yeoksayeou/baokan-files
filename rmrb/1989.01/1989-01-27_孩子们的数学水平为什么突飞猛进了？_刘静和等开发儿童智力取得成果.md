A set of experimental textbooks titled "Modern Elementary Mathematics" is currently being used in over 3,000 experimental classes across 29 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions. According to assessments from various regions, the mathematical thinking abilities of students in these experimental classes have reached or exceeded those of students one or two grades higher.

In July of last year, researchers in Beijing conducted an assessment involving 629 children from four primary schools. The assessment focused on the children's abilities in abstracting and reasoning about numbers and shapes. The children were given 14 questions, and the results showed that the average score for third-grade students in the experimental class was 11.26 (out of 14), while the average scores for third, fourth, and fifth-grade students in regular classes were 7.4, 8.25, and 9.48, respectively.

What gives this textbook such a powerful effect on developing children's intelligence? Liu Jinghe, a researcher at the Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences and the main compiler of the textbook, said that they have paid attention to teaching children not only mathematical knowledge but also scientific thinking methods, so that they understand both the "what" and the "why," and can infer from one instance to another.

As early as 13 years ago, a research team led by psychologist Liu Jinghe began exploring the development of children's mathematical thinking. They first conducted multiple experiments on children aged 4 to 11, focusing on their understanding of positive integers, geometric shapes, and fractions. They summarized 12 indicators for children's understanding of the relationship between parts and wholes, as well as four developmental levels for understanding relationships such as size, inclusion, mutual reversibility, and compensation. Subsequently, they collaborated with Beishan County Northern Experimental Primary School in Liaoning to conduct a systematic elementary mathematics teaching experiment. The school adopted their research findings, and students completed the entire elementary mathematics curriculum in just four years. In 1984, they formed a collaborative group with educational researchers, using "1" as the basic standard to reveal the relationships between parts and wholes in numbers and mathematics. They rewrote the textbooks with this as the main line and organized experimental classes in Hangzhou's Shangcheng District. Currently, this set of textbooks has been published by Science Press and is being promoted in many places.

Researchers introduced that one of the features of this set of textbooks is that it unifies integers, fractions, percentages, and ratios into one system, using "1" to explain their internal connections and transitions between levels. This makes the multiple meanings, relativity, and divisibility of "1" stand out. The textbook also incorporates Engels' idea that "even elementary mathematics is full of contradictions" by arranging a set of contradictions in each volume, such as one versus many, division versus combination, equality versus inequality, and so on. Practice has shown that using vivid teaching methods to reveal these contradictions is beneficial for cultivating children's dialectical thinking.

This research achievement has attracted the attention of the scientific and educational communities.

Qian Xuesen described this research as a "major breakthrough in applying Marxist philosophy to the fundamental theory of educational science."

A group of experts at a recent appraisal meeting also believed that this research has paved a way for the development of psychology and the integration of teaching practice.

　　孩子们的数学水平为什么突飞猛进了？    
    刘静和等开发儿童智力取得成果
    新华社北京１月２６日电（记者朱维新）一套取名《现代小学数学》的实验教材，目前正在２９个省、市、自治区的３０００多个实验班试用。从各地测查情况看，实验班学生的数学思维能力，达到或超过了比他们高一两个年级的孩子。
    去年７月，研究人员在北京四所小学以实验班三年级和普通班三、四、五年级为对象，测查了６２９名儿童在对数和形的概括、推理等方面的能力。他们出了１４道试题，结果三年级实验班平均成绩１１．２６分（满分为１４分），普通班三年级７．４分，四年级８．２５分，五年级９．４８分。
    这套教材对开发儿童智力为何有如此“魔力”？教材的主要编写者、中国科学院心理研究所研究员刘静和说，他们注意了让孩子在掌握数学知识的同时，学会科学思维的方法，使其知其然也知其所以然，知其一能知其二。
    以心理学家刘静和为首的研究小组早在１３年前就开始了对儿童数学思维发展的探讨。他们首先在４至１１岁的儿童中进行了对正整数、几何图形及分数的认识的多项实验，概括出儿童对部分与整体关系的认识的１２项指标，以及认识大小关系、包含关系、互补可逆关系和补偿关系的四个发展层次。之后，他们与辽宁黑山县北关实验学校合作进行了系统的小学数学教学试验。学校采用他们的研究成果，学生在四年时间便学完了小学数学的全部内容。１９８４年，他们又与教学研究人员组成协作组，以“１”为基础标准揭示数与数学中部分和整体关系为主线，重新编写了教材，并在杭州上城区组织先行实验班。目前，这套教材已由科学出版社出版，在许多地方推广使用。
    研究者介绍，这套教材的特点之一是把整数、分数、百分数、比值统一在一个系统之内，用“１”在说明它们的内在联系与层次间的过渡，这样就使“１”的多义性、相对性、可分性等性质突出地显示出来。教材还根据恩格斯提出的“初等数学也充满矛盾”的思想，在各册中结合知识内容编排了一对矛盾，如一与多、分与合、相等与不等……实践证明，用形象的教学手段去揭示这些矛盾，有利于萌发儿童的辩证思维。
    这一研究成果已引起科学界和教育界的重视。
    钱学森称这项研究是“运用马克思主义哲学对教育科学基础理论的重大突破”。
    一批专家在最近举行的鉴定会上也认为，这项研究为发展心理学和教学实际结合走出了一条路子。
