Recent scientific research on the common cold has provided many new insights.

A surprising fact is that the common cold is transmitted through human hands. The hands of people with colds often carry viruses due to blowing their noses, and these viruses are spread to objects they touch, such as telephones, doorknobs, and books. Viruses can typically survive on hard surfaces for up to 72 hours. When healthy people touch these objects, their hands become contaminated with viruses. When they touch their eyes or nose with their hands, they become infected with the virus, making it very easy to catch a cold. Therefore, experts recommend that the best way to prevent colds is to wash hands frequently with soap.

Emotional stress is an important factor in contracting a cold. Researchers have found that when people are anxious and stressed, their immune system weakens. If they come into contact with cold viruses, they are more likely to catch a cold. Therefore, those who are introverted and easily stressed are often more susceptible to colds than those who are open-minded and have a positive outlook.

After catching a cold, there is no need to be too worried. Because after catching a cold, a person will have some immunity to that particular virus for a period of time. The more times a person catches a cold, generally the less likely they are to catch a cold in the future. Therefore, older people are generally less likely to catch a cold.

　　关于感冒的新见解
    近来，科学家对感冒的研究提供了许多新的见解。
    令人吃惊的事实是感冒通过人的手传染。感冒患者的手常因擤鼻涕而带上病毒，并随手传播到手摸过的东西，如电话、门把手、书籍等。病毒通常能在硬物表面生存达７２小时之久。健康人的手接触这些东西时，便带上了病毒。当他们的手摸眼睛或鼻子时，便被感染了病毒，极易发生感冒。因此，专家们建议，预防感冒的最好办法是多用肥皂洗手。
    情绪紧张是引起感冒的一个重要因素。研究人员发现，当人们焦虑紧张时，免疫能力会下降。如果接触了感冒病毒，就极易发生感冒。因此，那些性格内向、容易紧张的人往往比豁达开朗、情绪乐观的人更容易感冒。
    得了感冒后，也不必懊恼。因为感冒一次后的一段时间内，人会对该种病毒有一定的免疫力。患感冒的次数越多，一般说以后患感冒的可能性越小。因此，一般上了年纪的人不太容易感冒。
