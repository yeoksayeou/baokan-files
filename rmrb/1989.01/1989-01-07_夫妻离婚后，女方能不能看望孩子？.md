Dear Editor:

In May 1988, my husband and I divorced due to incompatibility. The court ruled that our child would be raised by him, and I paid a one-time child support of 500 yuan. The first time I went to visit the child, I was met with the child's cries and the elders' scolding. The second time I went to visit the child, I was again refused. I ask: Is there anything wrong with me visiting the child? Do I still have the right and obligation to raise and educate the child?

Jin Zhen:

Divorce is the termination of the rights and obligations between husband and wife. However, Article 29 of the Marriage Law stipulates that the relationship between parents and children is not terminated by divorce. After divorce, regardless of whether the child is raised by the father or the mother, the child remains the child of both parents.

The relationship between husband and wife and the relationship between parents and children are of different natures. The relationship between husband and wife is a consensual union between two people, which can be established through legal procedures and can also be terminated through legal procedures. The relationship between parents and children is based on the natural blood relationship formed by the birth of the child. Except for the legal provision that "the relationship is terminated due to the establishment of an adoption relationship," it cannot be terminated. Therefore, after the husband and wife divorce, regardless of whether the child lives with the father or the mother, the child remains the child of both parties. The Marriage Law also stipulates that parents have the obligation to raise and educate their children, and children have the obligation to support and assist their parents; parents have the right and obligation to discipline and protect minors; parents and children have the right to inherit each other's property, etc. These provisions are equally applicable to the parent-child relationship after divorce. You mentioned in your letter that after your divorce from your husband, the child is raised by him, and he and his family members refuse your right to raise and discipline the child and insult you. This is an illegal act. For this, you can go through your child's father's work unit or the grassroots organization of the neighborhood committee to educate your child's father and his family members, so that they understand the law and ensure your right and obligation to raise and discipline the child.

### 夫妻离婚后，女方能不能看望孩子？

　　夫妻离婚后，女方能不能看望孩子？
    编辑同志：
    １９８８年５月，我与丈夫因性格不合，经法院判决离婚。孩子归男方抚养，由我一次性付给孩子抚养费５００元。我第一次去看望孩子，换来的却是孩子的哭声和老人的骂声。第二次我去看孩子又遭到拒绝。请问：我看望孩子有什么错？我还有没有抚养和教育孩子的权利和义务？
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　江苏建湖县高作镇工业供销经理部　金珍金珍同志：
    离婚是夫妻间权利义务关系的消除。但是，婚姻法第２９条规定：父母与子女间的关系，不因父母离婚而消除。离婚后，子女无论由父方或母方抚养，仍是父母双方的子女。
    夫妻关系和父母子女关系，是不同性质的关系。夫妻关系是男女双方合意的两性结合，可以经法律的程序而产生，也可以经法律的程序而消除。父母同子女的关系，是基于子女出生的自然血亲关系而形成，除法律规定“因收养关系的成立而消除”外，是不能解除的。因此，夫妻双方离婚后，子女无论随父或随母生活，仍是双方的子女。婚姻法还规定父母对子女有抚养教育的义务，子女对父母有赡养扶助的义务；父母有管教和保护未成年子女的权利和义务；父母和子女有相互继承遗产的权利，等等。这些规定，同样适用于离婚后的父母子女关系。你来信反映，你和丈夫离婚后，孩子由男方抚养，男方及其家人拒绝你抚养和管教孩子，并辱骂你，这是一种违法行为。对此，你可通过你孩子父亲的工作单位或街道基层组织，对孩子的父亲及其家人进行教育，使他们知法懂法，保证你抚养、管教孩子的权利和义务。
