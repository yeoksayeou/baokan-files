Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party Embarks on Difficult Path of Reevaluating 1956 Event
Special Committee Deems Event Itself a "People's Uprising"

	NEW YORK, Jan. 29 (Xinhua) -- The Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party has embarked on the difficult path of reevaluating the 1956 event.

	This was revealed by Imre Pozsgay, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and Minister of State, in a radio broadcast on the 28th.

	He said that the Party Central Committee recently established a special committee to review the history of Hungary after its liberation. Although the committee has not yet proposed to rehabilitate Imre Nagy, who served as Prime Minister in 1956 and was executed in 1958, it has affirmed that Nagy was correct in his actions from 1954 to 1955. Previously, the official stance had been to accuse Nagy of "further weakening the Party's authority and the people's government" during this period.

	Pozsgay said that the committee's evaluation of Nagy's role and activities during the 1956 event is still a subject of debate, but it has concluded that the 1956 event itself was a "people's uprising," a "rebellion against the oligarchic rule that despised the entire nation." The committee also believes that it is "untenable" to simply label the 1956 event as a counter-revolutionary event.

　　一九五六年事件是耶非耶     
    匈党踏上重新评价的艰难历程    
    专门委员会认为事件本身是“人民起义”
    新华社布达佩斯１月２９日电  匈牙利社会主义工人党已踏上重新评价１９５６年事件的艰难历程。
    这是匈牙利社会主义工人党中央政治局委员、政府国务部长波日高伊·伊姆雷２８日在广播电台发表谈话时透露的。
    他说，党中央不久前成立一个负责审查匈解放后历史的专门委员会。该委员会在匈牙利１９５６年事件问题上虽然尚未提出为１９５６年曾任政府总理、１９５８年被处死的纳吉·伊姆雷平反，但已肯定他在１９５４至１９５５年是正确的。在此之前，官方一直指责纳吉在这个期间“想进一步削弱党的威信和人民政权”。
    波日高伊说，委员会对纳吉在１９５６年事件中的作用和活动的评价尚有争论，但认为１９５６年事件本身是“人民起义”，是“一次反对蔑视整个民族的寡头统治的起义”。委员会还认为，简单地把１９５６年事件称为反革命事件是“站不住脚的”。
