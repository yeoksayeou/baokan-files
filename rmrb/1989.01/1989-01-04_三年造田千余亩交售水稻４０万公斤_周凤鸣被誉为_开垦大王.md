	Three years of land reclamation yielding over 1,000 acres and 400,000 kilograms of rice sold to the state, Zhou Fengming is hailed as the "Reclamation King."

	New China News Agency, Shenyang, January 3rd: Farmer Zhou Fengming of Donggou County's Five-Four Farm in Liaoning Province has used land as his foundation. Over the past three years, he has invested over 2 million yuan to transform a 1,029-acre reed marsh into paddy fields, selling 400,000 kilograms of rice to the state. He is hailed by the people as the "Reclamation King."

	In the spring of 1985, Zhou Fengming took on the task of reclaiming a reed marsh within the jurisdiction of Anmin Township. He spent 500,000 yuan to hire tractors to plow and reclaim 300 acres of land, producing 80,000 kilograms of grain that autumn. Zhou Fengming continued his reclamation efforts, and in the spring of 1987, he invested over 1 million yuan. He filled in 30 large and small gullies, built levees, and excavated over 100,000 cubic meters of soil, finally transforming the reed marsh into paddy fields. That year, he produced 300,000 kilograms of rice. Although there was no grain procurement task, he still sold 200,000 kilograms of rice to the state. In 1988, he produced 350,000 kilograms of rice and voluntarily sold another 200,000 kilograms to the state.
