In the context of reform and expanding external exchanges, the organization of international exhibitions in the Soviet Union has begun to focus on economic benefits, aiming to use exhibitions to promote economic cooperation between domestic enterprises and foreign enterprises.

The Deputy Chairman of the All-Union Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Kanayev, today introduced the Soviet Union's plans for hosting international exhibitions and participating in foreign exhibitions this year at a press conference here.

The All-Union Chamber of Commerce and Industry system will host 23 large-scale international exhibitions in the Soviet Union this year, covering areas such as railway transportation, forestry, automation control, consumer goods industry, and tourism. In addition, it will participate in 31 large-scale exhibitions abroad, including the first Beijing International Expo scheduled to be held at the end of June. All exhibitions held abroad by the Soviet Union are funded by the participating units themselves, so they pay great attention to the economic results of the exhibitions.

In response to a question from our reporter, Mikhailov, the Director of the All-Union Exhibition Center, said that Soviet people have a keen interest in Chinese exhibits. Currently, Soviet enterprises and cooperatives have the right to independently operate foreign trade, and they are eager to establish direct economic ties or do business with Chinese counterpart enterprises through visiting exhibitions.

According to information obtained by our reporter from the Soviet National Economic Exhibition Hall, from July 14 to 23 this year, a Chinese Science and Technology Exhibition will be held at the Soviet National Economic Exhibition Hall, showcasing the achievements of China's science and technology and economic management system reforms.

　　苏注重举办国际展览会经济效益
    新华社莫斯科１月１０日电  （记者盛世良）在改革与扩大对外交往的形势下，苏联国际展览会的组织工作变得注重经济效益，力求利用展览会促进本国企业同外国企业的经济合作。
    全苏工商会主席团副主席卡纳耶夫今天在这里的记者招待会上介绍了苏联今年举办国际展览和参加外国展览的计划。
    全苏工商会系统今年将在苏联举行２３个大型国际展览，涉及铁路运输、森林工业、自动化控制、消费品工业、旅游业等。此外，还要参加外国的３１个大型展览，包括将在６月底举行的首届北京国际博览会。苏联在国外举办的展览会都由参展单位自己出钱，因此十分注重展览的经济成果。
    全苏展览中心主任米哈伊洛夫在回答本社记者提问时说，苏联人对中国的展品兴趣很浓厚。目前，苏联的企业和合作社都有独立经营外贸的权利，它们很想通过参观展览同中国对口企业做生意或建立直接经济联系。
    据记者从苏联国民经济展览馆获悉，今年７月１４日至２３日将在苏联国民经济展览馆举办中国科技展，介绍中国科技与经济管理体制改革的成就。
