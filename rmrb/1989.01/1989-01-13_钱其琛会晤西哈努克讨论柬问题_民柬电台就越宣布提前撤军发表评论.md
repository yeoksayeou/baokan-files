Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen today met with Prince Sihanouk at the former Cambodian embassy in Paris, where they had a friendly and cordial conversation.

Foreign Minister Qian said that 1989 is a crucial year for resolving the Cambodian issue. He hoped that with the joint efforts of all parties concerned, significant progress could be made this year in achieving a fair and reasonable solution to the Cambodian issue.

Foreign Minister Qian emphasized that the key to a political solution for Cambodia lies in Vietnam withdrawing its troops from Cambodia as soon as possible and the four parties reaching a consensus through consultation to form a genuine quadripartite coalition government led by Prince Sihanouk. He praised Prince Sihanouk's efforts in promoting a political solution to the Cambodian issue and gave high evaluations of his activities. He reiterated China's full support for Prince Sihanouk's five-point proposal for resolving the Cambodian issue.

Prince Sihanouk said that his five-point proposal for a political solution to the Cambodian issue is reasonable and should be accepted by all parties concerned. He stressed that in the future, he would continue to strive tirelessly for the establishment of an independent, neutral, peaceful, and non-aligned Cambodia.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 11—The Democratic Kampuchea Radio today issued a commentary stating that Vietnam's announcement on January 6 that it would withdraw all its troops from Cambodia by September this year is of no value because the conditions for withdrawal indicate that Vietnam remains adamant in its stance.

The commentary said that Vietnam's withdrawal is conditional. It demands that the international community cease all aid to the Cambodian resistance forces, thereby achieving its goal of eliminating the Cambodian resistance forces, which it failed to achieve on the battlefield.

The commentary emphasized that if Vietnam truly has the intention to resolve the Cambodian issue politically, it should accept Prince Sihanouk's five-point proposal. Only then can the Cambodian issue be resolved fairly, reasonably, and effectively in a just and lasting manner.

　　钱其琛会晤西哈努克讨论柬问题
    民柬电台就越宣布提前撤军发表评论
    本报巴黎１月１１日电  记者张启华报道：中国外长钱其琛今天在巴黎前柬埔寨驻法大使官邸会见了西哈努克亲王，双方进行了亲切友好的谈话。
    钱外长说，１９８９年是解决柬埔寨问题的关键的一年。他希望，在有关各方的共同努力下，柬埔寨问题的公正合理解决今年能取得重大进展。
    钱外长强调，政治解决柬埔寨问题的关键是：越南尽早从柬埔寨撤军；四方通过协商取得一致，成立真正以西哈努克亲王为首的四方联合政府。他对西哈努克亲王为政治解决柬埔寨问题所进行的一些活动表示赞赏并给予高度评价。他重申完全支持西哈努克亲王提出的解决柬问题的五点建议。
    西哈努克亲王说，他提出的政治解决柬埔寨问题的五点建议是合理的，理应为有关各方所接受。他强调，今后，他将坚持不懈地为建立一个独立、中立、和平与不结盟的柬埔寨而继续奋斗。
    据新华社北京１月１１日电　民主柬埔寨电台今天发表评论指出，越南１月６日宣布今年９月前从柬全部撤军是毫无价值的，因为撤军的条件表明，越南仍坚持其顽固立场。
    评论说，越南撤军是有条件的。它要求国际社会停止对柬埔寨抵抗力量的一切援助，从而达到它在战场上没能达到的消灭柬埔寨抵抗力量的目的。
    评论强调，如果越南真有政治解决柬问题的诚意，那么它应当接受西哈努克亲王提出的五点建议，这样才能公平、合理、有效地使柬埔寨问题得到公正、持久的解决。
