India plans to significantly increase its weapon exports.

Indian Defense Minister Krishna Chandra Pant announced on the 30th that India will soon greatly increase its weapon exports.

He told the press that for this purpose, the Defense Department will establish a new agency to specifically answer foreign inquiries about purchasing weapons.

However, he also said, "We will carefully consider to whom and what kind of weapons we will sell."

Pant said that India's current military industry is sufficient to allow its products to occupy a portion of the international weapons market. He said that exports will promote the development of India's defense industry and will solve the financial problems of importing high-tech defense equipment.

　　印度计划将增加武器出口
    印度国防部长克里希纳·钱德拉·潘特三十日宣布，印度不久将大规模增加武器出口。
    他对新闻界说，为此，国防部将建立一个新的机构，专门解答外国关于购买武器的询问。
    然而，他又说：“我们将谨慎地考虑向哪些地方出售武器及出售何种武器。”
    潘特说，印度现有的军火工业足以使其产品占领一部分国际武器市场。他说，出口将促进印度国防工业的发展并将解决国防高技术进口的财政问题。
