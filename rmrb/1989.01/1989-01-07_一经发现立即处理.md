In the construction of a clean government and the rectification of the economy, various regions have established reporting agencies. Regarding reporting, the people have high enthusiasm on one hand, but on the other hand, they have concerns—fear of retaliation.

Can we say that the people's concerns are unnecessary? Let's look at a recent example provided by the *Southern Daily*: The reporting center of the Xingning County Procuratorate received materials from the public exposing that the responsible person of the county's Commerce Bureau, Zhang Yuliang, was using his power for personal gain. However, the member of the reporting center and deputy section chief of the procuratorate, Lai Maosheng, in order to achieve the goal of transferring his wife into the commerce sector, actually leaked the content of the public's report, including the paper used and the handwriting, to Zhang Yuliang. As a result, Zhang Yuliang became even more arrogant and openly threatened the reporter, creating a very bad influence.

Fortunately, the Xingning County Discipline Inspection Commission seriously handled this matter, expelling Lai Maosheng from the party for abusing his power and recommending the revocation of his administrative position and transfer from the reporting center; Zhang Yuliang was given a one-year probationary period within the party and a recommendation to revoke his position as the responsible person of the Commerce Bureau.

Reporting is a good way to implement public supervision and fight against corruption, embezzlement, and dereliction of duty. To ensure that it can be carried out effectively for a long time, it is indeed not negligible to protect reporters from retaliation (including keeping their information confidential). If someone threatens or retaliates against reporters, or if staff members leak information for personal gain, they must be dealt with strictly upon discovery. Only in this way can the courage of the people be inspired.

　　一经发现立即处理
    钟怀
    在廉政建设和治理整顿经济中，各地相继建立了举报机构。对举报，人民群众一方面积极性很高，另一方面又有顾虑——怕打击报复。
    能说群众这种顾虑是多余的吗？请看最近《南方日报》提供的一个事例：广东兴宁县检察院举报中心曾收到群众揭发县商业局负责人曾宇良以权谋私的材料，可是举报中心成员、县检察院的副科长赖茂生，为达到把自己的老婆调入商业部门的目的，竟将群众举报内容，连所用信纸、书写字体等都向曾宇良告密。曾宇良因此气焰嚣张，公然威胁举报人，造成极为恶劣的影响。
    值得庆幸的是，兴宁县纪委对这件事作了严肃处理，把徇私枉法的赖茂生开除出党，并建议撤销他的行政职务，调离举报中心；对曾宇良给予留党察看一年处分，并建议撤销其商业局负责人的职务。
    举报，是实行群众监督，同贪污受贿、弄权渎职等腐败现象作斗争的好方式。要使之长期有效地开展下去，保护举报者不受打击报复（包括为他们保密）实在不容忽视。如果有人威胁、打击举报者，有工作人员徇私泄密，一经发现，立即处理，而且要处理得严格。这样才能鼓舞群众的勇气。
