    Fixed asset investment in the country remains uncontrolled, and the Construction Bank must actively cooperate with relevant departments to reduce construction scale and adjust investment structure. This was pointed out by Construction Bank President Zhou Daojin on January 22 at a meeting of branch managers held in Beijing.

    Currently, the problems of overheating economy and excessive fixed asset investment have not been resolved. According to statistics, there are approximately 200,000 projects under construction nationwide, with a total scale of around 1.3 trillion yuan. Only about 10,000 projects have been decided to be halted, with a total investment of only about 3% of the total construction scale. Moreover, the phenomenon of halting construction on one hand while rushing construction on the other still exists. After the State Council explicitly prohibited the opening of new projects, the number of new projects started each month in the last three months of last year was still significant. In recent years, projects planned by the state to be put into production and key projects guaranteed by the state have been delayed due to lack of funds and materials.

    The State Council requires that in 1989, the cleanup of ongoing projects must be genuine, with real cuts and real reductions, not fake cuts and fake reductions. Not only should a large number of ongoing office buildings and other non-production projects be cut, but also a number of production projects should be halted or delayed. Not only should projects that should not be started be firmly halted, but also some projects that should be started, including energy, transportation, and raw material industries, should be rearranged according to the state's financial and material capabilities. Some of these should also be halted or delayed.

    According to the above requirements, in 1989, the Construction Bank must strictly implement the policy of tightening fiscal and financial controls, actively participate in the cleanup of ongoing projects, strictly control credit and investment scales, and optimize the loan structure. The following key tasks must be focused on:

    — With mobilizing urban and rural residents' savings as the center, actively attract deposits. Increase savings outlets, strictly implement national interest rate policies, improve services, and gain the trust of depositors. Consolidate and expand new savings types, and actively handle housing savings and residential housing loan businesses.

    — Strictly control credit scale and strengthen loan management. According to the instructions of the State Council, in 1989, fixed asset investment loans, whether for basic construction or technological transformation, will be managed under a mandatory plan. Fixed asset investment loans should prioritize the needs of key projects and production projects within the state plan, while other investment loans will be subject to the "ten no-loans" policy: no loans for projects outside the state plan, no loans for projects started without authorization, no loans for projects exceeding the annual investment plan scale, no loans for projects that should be funded by self-raised funds, no loans for non-production projects prohibited by the state, no loans for projects that violate national industry plans and blindly set up, no loans for high-energy-consuming projects restricted by the state, no loans for repetitive construction projects competing with large factories for raw materials, no loans for projects without construction conditions or external supporting conditions, and no loans for projects without repayment capabilities.

    — Manage fiscal funds well to ensure the needs of key construction projects. For projects that arbitrarily undertake extra-plan construction, misuse construction funds, blindly purchase and hoard materials, waste, and give gifts, unreasonable expenditures must be firmly refused.

    — Actively cooperate with relevant departments to clean up ongoing projects. Each locality should list the projects under construction and determine which ones to halt, and firmly stop lending to them. For self-funded construction projects and office building projects, persuade the construction units to transfer the funds to the Construction Bank. For those that refuse to transfer, report to the leading departments to take administrative measures to limit the transfer within a specified period.

　　基建投资仍未有效控制    
    压缩的投资仅占在建总规模的百分之三左右    
    建设银行召开分行长会议提出对策
    本报讯  记者梅洪如报道：全国固定资产投资规模仍未得到应有的控制，建设银行要积极配合有关部门，压缩建设规模、调整投资结构。这是建设银行行长周道炯１月２２日在北京举行的全国分行长会议上指出的。
    当前，经济过热、固定资产投资过猛的问题并没有得到解决。据统计，全国施工在建的项目约２０万个，总规模１．３万亿元左右，目前已决定停建的项目只有１万多个，总投资只占在建总规模的３％左右。而且，一面压，一面突击施工的现象依然存在。在国务院明令禁止再开新项目以后，去年最后三个月每月新开工的项目仍然不少。近几年国家计划要求投产的项目和确保的重点工程，因缺乏资金和物资，工期一再拖延。
    国务院要求１９８９年清理在建项目必须动真格的，要真砍真压，不能假砍假压。不仅要砍掉一大批在建的楼堂馆所和其它不必要的非生产性项目，还要停建、缓建一批生产性的项目；不仅那些不应该上的项目要坚决压下来，就是某些应该上的项目，包括能源、交通和原材料工业在内，也要根据国家财力、物力的可能重新安排，有的也要停建、缓建。
    根据上述要求，１９８９年建设银行要坚决贯彻紧缩财政金融的方针，积极参与清理在建项目，严格控制信贷规模和投资规模，优化贷款结构。重点要抓好以下几项工作：
    ——以动员城乡居民储蓄为中心，大力吸收存款。要增加储蓄网点，认真执行国家利率政策，改善服务，取信储户。要巩固和扩大新储种，积极办好住宅储蓄和居民住房贷款业务。
    ——严格控制信贷规模，加强贷款管理。根据国务院指示，１９８９年对固定资产投资贷款，不论是基本建设贷款还是技术改造贷款，一律实行指令性计划管理。固定资产投资贷款要优先支持国家计划内重点工程和投产项目的需要，对其它投资贷款则实行“十不贷”，即国家计划外的项目不贷，擅自新开工的项目不贷，超过年度投资计划规模的项目不贷，应当用自筹资金安排的项目不贷，禁止兴建的非生产性项目不贷，违背国家行业规划盲目布点的项目不贷，国家限制发展的高耗能项目不贷，与大厂争原料的重复建设项目不贷，建设条件不具备、外部配套条件不落实的项目不贷，没有偿还能力的项目不贷。
    ——管好财政资金，保证重点建设需要。对于乱搞计划外工程，挪用基建资金，盲目采购、囤积物资、铺张浪费、请客送礼等不合理用款，要坚决拒绝付款。
    ——积极配合有关部门清理在建项目。各地对在建项目要列出清单，确定停建的，坚决停止贷款。对于自筹的基建项目、楼堂馆所工程，要说服筹建单位把资金转存建设银行，拒不转存的，要报告领导部门采取行政措施，限期转存。
