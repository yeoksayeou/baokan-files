The Lunar New Year is approaching, and people are buying year-end supplies in large quantities, as if money were no object.

In a department store on Zhongshan Road in Qingdao, a parent dressed in a railway uniform bought a P-type electric tank toy for his child, who had just started school, for 45 yuan. The child said, "With this electric tank, I now have 5 electric toys. They were all given to me during the New Year."

It is understood that in most ordinary families in Qingdao, a significant portion of the New Year's spending is for children. A teacher from a kindergarten said, "Nowadays, the New Year seems to be celebrated mainly for the children."

Before the New Year, the reporter chatted with over a hundred children aged five to fourteen. Those innocent children were full of enthusiasm for the New Year. A fourth-grade girl from Guangrao Road in Qingdao said, "During the New Year, my family gives me so many things. Last New Year, my father, mother, and many relatives and elders gave me red envelopes. The smallest amount was 10 yuan, and I received nearly 300 yuan in total."

Before the Spring Festival, a class in Qingdao No. 39 Middle School conducted a survey. The 63 students in this class received many gifts for the New Year. Many parents linked their New Year's gifts to their children's academic performance before the winter vacation. The reporter saw a list of gifts from a parent to a child, which included items like bicycles, electronic keyboards, and mechanical watches. Some even wrote "buy whatever the child wants" or "give a lot of money." The reporter once chatted with a colleague from the Port Bureau, who believed that "giving gifts to children during the New Year is a one-time deal," meaning if the child wants something, just buy it.

It is natural for children to have new clothes and a lively atmosphere during the New Year, and it is also acceptable for parents to give some gifts. However, excessive giving can easily lead to children comparing with each other and may inflate their desire for money and material possessions.

### 莫塞破孩子的年货兜

　　莫塞破孩子的年货兜
    春节将至，人们大包小包地拚命购买年货，好像不要钱似的。
    在青岛中山路一家百货商店的儿童玩具柜台前，一位穿铁路制服的家长给他的刚上学的孩子花４５元钱买了—Ｐ电动坦克车，那孩子说，加上这架电动坦克车，我有５架电动玩具了，都是过年时人家送的。
    据了解，青岛大多数普通家庭，在年货的花销里很大一部分是投给孩子的。一位幼儿园的阿姨说，现在过年简直是专为孩子们过的。
    记者年前同百多名五六岁到十三四岁的孩子们聊过，那些天真烂漫的孩子对过年可是充满了兴趣。青岛广饶路４年级的一位女生说：“过年，家里人给我好多好多东西。去年过年，爸爸、妈妈和好多亲戚长辈都给我压岁钱，最少的１０元，我光收的压岁钱就有近３００元呢。”
    青岛第３９中学初一的一个班，春节前作了一个调查，这个班６３名同学，过年的礼物都不少。其中不少家长过年的礼物要和孩子们放寒假前考试的成绩相联系。记者看到一张家长给孩子的礼物表上有：自行车、电子琴、机械表等，还有的写“要什么给什么”或“给很多钱”。记者曾和港务局的一位同志聊天，他的观点就是，孩子过年是“一锤子买卖”，孩子要啥就给买。
    孩子们过年一身新，热热闹闹理当然，当家长送点礼物也未尝不可，但过度馈赠，也容易引起孩子们互相攀比，还会造成孩子们对钱与物欲望的膨胀。
