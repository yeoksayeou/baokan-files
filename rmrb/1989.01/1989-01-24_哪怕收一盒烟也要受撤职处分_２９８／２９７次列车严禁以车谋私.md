A passenger from Jiangxi carrying over ten thousand yuan boarded the 297 train to Dandong in Beijing and asked the attendant Yu Huimin to help him secure a berth. To ensure the passenger's safety, a temporary emergency berth was arranged for him despite all berths being sold out. The passenger was extremely grateful and tried to give Yu Huimin 30 yuan, saying, "This is the rule when I go out on business." However, Yu Huimin told him, "Helping passengers is the rule of our train, and your rule doesn't apply here."

The 298/297 train, operated by the Dandong Railway Section, strictly prohibits using the train for personal gain. This train travels through Liaoxi and Chengde to Beijing, taking 50 hours each way, and is often overcrowded by more than 50%. Many passengers want to secure a berth, and some are willing to pay for it. In response to some trains accepting money for berths, the Dandong Railway Section has clearly stipulated that accepting money or gifts for arranging berths is strictly prohibited. Even accepting a box of cigarettes will result in dismissal. Since last year, incidents similar to Yu Huimin's refusal to accept passenger money have occurred multiple times among the 12 conductors and some attendants on the 298/297 train, totaling nearly 100 instances.

The 298/297 train adheres to the principle of prioritizing service and does not allow various business activities to interfere with passenger service. Previously, many trains stopped providing hot water and instead sold beverages and food to make money. The 298/297 train team, after discussion, made a rule: the train can designate someone to sell goods as long as it does not affect normal services, especially ensuring an adequate supply of hot water and maintaining cleanliness. The prices will not exceed those in local stores. The attendants do not get distracted by small profits and focus on serving the passengers. During the summer, when the carriages are crowded, the crew would go outside the train to fetch water for the passengers, ensuring they could drink cool boiled water to quench their thirst and cool down.

### 哪怕收一盒烟也要受撤职处分   ２９８／２９７次列车严禁以车谋私

　　哪怕收一盒烟也要受撤职处分    
    ２９８／２９７次列车严禁以车谋私
    据新华社电（记者李新彦、陈光明）一位携带着上万元人民币的江西旅客，在北京登上开往丹东的２９７次列车后，请求业务员于惠敏为他解决一张卧铺。为了这位旅客的安全，在卧铺票已售完的情况下，车上临时安排他到预留应急的铺位上休息。这位旅客感激万分，掏出３０元钱要塞给于惠敏，并说：“这是我外出办事的规矩。”小于却告诉他：“为旅客排忧解难是我们人民列车的规矩，你那规矩在这趟车上不适用了。”
    坚决杜绝以车谋私，是丹东列车段２９８／２９７次列车思想政治工作的重点。这趟列车经辽西、承德线开往北京，往返需５０个小时，旅客超员经常在５０％以上。旅客上车后，想办卧铺的多，有的甚至不惜用钱财换取席位。针对有些列车利用办卧铺收受钱物的问题，丹东列车段明确规定，办理卧铺不准索要和接受钱物，哪怕收一盒烟，也要予以撤职处分。去年以来，类似于惠敏这样拒收旅客财物的事情，在２９８／２９７次列车的１２位车长和一些列车员身上都发生过，共拒收钱物近百次。
    ２９８／２９７次列车坚持服务第一的方针，决不允许多种经营冲击为旅客服务的方向。前一段时间，不少列车不送开水，专卖饮料、食品赚钱。２９８／２９７次车队经过讨论作出规定，列车在不影响正常服务，尤其是在保证供足开水、清理好卫生的前提下，可指定专人售货，价格决不高于地方商店。服务员不为蝇头小利分心，为旅客服务就专心。盛夏时节，车厢内拥挤，乘务人员就下车从窗下为旅客送水，使大汗淋淋的旅客能喝上既解渴又消热的凉开水。
