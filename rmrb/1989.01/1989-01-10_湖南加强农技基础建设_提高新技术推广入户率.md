Hunan Strengthens Agricultural Technology Infrastructure to Increase Household Adoption of New Technologies

	Hunan province has been actively promoting the establishment of various community-based technical service organizations to increase the adoption of new technologies at the household level.

	Since last spring, the provincial agricultural bureau has focused on restoring and building village-level agricultural technology service organizations. Counties such as Hengshan, Qidong, and Mili have taken the lead in restoring and establishing village agricultural technology service stations (teams), and have assigned full-time and part-time agricultural technology personnel. Hengshan County allocated 100,000 yuan from the township and village-level financial revenues last year as a special fund to hire village and team-level agricultural technology personnel. The county equipped 323 villages and 168 village committees with one full-time agricultural technology personnel each. In addition to the position allowance, village and team-level agricultural technology personnel receive a certain amount of new technology promotion fee each month. Agricultural technology personnel visit thousands of households, provide services to the fields, strengthen the promotion of new technologies, and increase the adoption of science and technology at the household level. After Hengshan County restored the village-level agricultural technology personnel in 1988, the county promoted 59 new technologies, an increase of 15 compared to 1987. Due to the accelerated promotion and application of new technologies, agricultural production has shown a gratifying situation. Last year, the county's total grain production reached nearly 200 million kilograms, an increase of 115 million kilograms compared to 1987.

　　湖南加强农技基础建设
    提高新技术推广入户率
    本报讯  近年来，湖南省各级农业部门积极扶植乡村建立各种民办的技术服务组织，提高新技术推广的入户率。
    从去年春天以来，省农业厅重点抓了村级农技服务组织的恢复和建设。衡山、祁东、汨罗等县率先恢复建立了村农技服务站（组），配备了专职和兼职农技员。衡山县去年从乡村两级财政收入中拿出１０万元作为聘请村组农技员的专项资金，为全县３２３个村和１６８个村民小组配备了一名专职农技员，村组农技员每人每月除岗位补贴外，还有一定的新技术推广费。农技员走千家串万户，服务到田，加强新技术推广，提高科技入户率。衡山县１９８８年恢复村农技员后，全县推广新技术５９项，比１９８７年增加１５项。由于加速了新技术的推广应用，农业生产出现了可喜的局面。去年全县粮食总产接近２亿公斤，比１９８７年增加１１５０万公斤。
