The "Chinese People's Liberation Army Historical Materials Series" is being published in succession by the People's Liberation Army Press. The first batch of three volumes, which include reminiscences and documents about the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army, and the Huaihai Campaign, have already been released to readers.

This is the first large-scale series of historical books by our army, with a planned 43 volumes. Each volume includes summaries, historical documents, reminiscences, chronologies, as well as photographs and charts. Some volumes also include reference materials from friendly or enemy forces. This series compiles historical materials, focusing on the army's establishment and combat operations, and reflects the army's tortuous yet glorious development process from military, political, and logistical perspectives.

The Central Military Commission attaches great importance to the compilation and publication of this series. In July 1986, the Military Commission approved the establishment of the Army Historical Materials Series Editorial Committee. Yang Dezhi, Qin Jiwei, Song Shilun, Ye Fei, Chen Pixin, Xiao Ke, and Wang Ping oversaw the editing and review of key volumes.
