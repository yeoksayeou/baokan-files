The award ceremony for Sichuan's Top Ten Athletes held in Chengdu was indeed a high-profile event. However, amidst the warm, grand, and joyful atmosphere, there was a shadow of emptiness, as only seven athletes were selected. The intention of the selectors was clear: prioritize quality over quantity to ensure the standards are met. Zhang Hao, the provincial governor, highly praised this approach, stating, "Select as many as there are, don't go through the motions, and make the selection activity reach the appropriate level!"

As leaders of the sports sector in a province with a population of over 100 million, the heads of the Sichuan Provincial Sports Commission understand that in 1988, Sichuan's athletic performance was notable nationwide. In terms of the Olympics, Sichuan athletes achieved "three ascents": the number of participating athletes increased from eight in the previous Olympics to fifteen, the number of participating events increased from six to twelve, and the number of medal winners increased from four athletes in two events to four athletes in four events. However, faced with the selectors' high standards, they did not feel resentful but instead saw the potential crises and areas in need of reform in Sichuan's sports sector.

These leaders spoke wisely: "There are no suitable successors to athletes like Gao Min and Chen Longcan, and the vacancies in the Top Ten are a mirror for reflection." Sichuan Province lacks continuity in high-level athletes, sports research lags behind, the level of sports socialization is low, and the training conditions for excellent teams are still poor...

Recently, nine young players from the Sichuan football team left a handwritten note saying "We firmly request to resign" and left without notice. The reasons for their departure are many, but their call for reform and dissatisfaction with the current training system and methods can be considered important reasons. This is a sign of crisis, so there is no reason to be complacent about the achievements!

### 四川十佳评选宁缺毋滥

　　四川十佳评选宁缺毋滥
    新华社成都一月二十九日电（记者徐波）在成都举行的十佳运动员发奖大会可以说是超规格的。但热烈、隆重、喜庆的气氛中却隐含着空缺的阴影，毕竟十佳运动员只评选出七名。作为评选者的意图非常明显：宁缺毋滥，保证质量。张皓若省长十分赞赏这种做法，他认为“有多少就选多少，不走过场，使评选活动达到应有的水准！”
    作为一亿人口的大省的体育当家人——四川省体委的领导者们，心里明白，过去的一九八八年，四川省的体育运动竞技水平，在全国应该是说得起话的。就奥运会而论，四川的运动健儿实现了“三个上升”，即参赛运动员由上届的八人上升为十五人，参赛项目由上届的六项上升为十二项，获奖面由上届的四人二项上升为四人四项。但是面对评选者的“苛刻”，他们并没有恼怒，而是更多地看到四川体育事业潜伏的危机和急待改革的方面。
    这些领导者们说得好！“高敏、陈龙灿后面还没有像样的接班人，十佳的空缺正是反思的镜子。”四川省在高水准的运动员衔接上显得后继乏人，体育科研工作跟不上，体育社会化程度不高，优秀运动队训练条件还太差……
    前不久四川足球队九名小伙子留下一张“坚决要求离职”的铅笔字条便不辞而别。出走的原因很多，但他们呼吁改革，不满现在的训练体制和方法可说是重要原因之一。这就是危机的信号，所以没有理由在成绩上沾沾自喜！
