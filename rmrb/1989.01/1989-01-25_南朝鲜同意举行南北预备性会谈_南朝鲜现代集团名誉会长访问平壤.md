South Korea agrees to hold preparatory talks between the South and North

South Korean Prime Minister Lee Han-kyu today replied to a letter from North Korean Premier Yon Hyong-muk, stating that on February 8, a delegation led by a deputy minister will go to Panmunjom to hold preparatory talks with the North on the issue of holding a prime ministerial meeting between the South and North.

Lee Han-kyu's reply today stated that he agreed to the proposal by North Korean Premier Yon Hyong-muk to hold deputy minister-level preparatory talks on February 8. He also expressed the belief that the exchange of visits between the two prime ministers of the South and North to discuss the issue of easing tensions on the Korean Peninsula would be beneficial in eliminating mutual mistrust and misunderstandings between the South and North.

Recently, North Korea has repeatedly proposed that if the United States and South Korea hold the "Spirit of Cooperation" joint military exercises, it will affect the dialogue between the South and North. However, Lee Han-kyu's reply today did not mention this issue.

New China News Agency, Pyongyang, January 23 (Reporter Li Nengqing) A delegation of four, led by Chung Ju-yung, honorary chairman of South Korea's Modern Industrial Group and a prominent figure in the economic sector, arrived in Pyongyang by plane this afternoon at the invitation of the North Korean Red Cross. This is the first time in many years that a prominent figure from South Korea's economic sector has visited North Korea.

After stepping off the plane, Chung Ju-yung and his delegation went to the airport's arrival hall, where they met with relatives who had been waiting there. Twenty relatives of Chung Ju-yung, who had rushed from Tongcheon County, Gangwon Province, to welcome him, surrounded him, asking about his well-being.

Accompanied by Vice Chairman Chon Kim-chol of the North Korean Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, Chung Ju-yung and his delegation went to the rest room, where his relatives briefly introduced the changes in his hometown. They then left the airport together by car.

When asked about the purpose of this visit, Li Byung-gi, director of Chung Ju-yung's secretariat, said that in addition to returning to his hometown to visit relatives, they would also discuss the issue of jointly developing the scenic resources of Kumgang Mountain, a famous tourist attraction in Korea. When asked if they would discuss economic exchanges between the South and North, Li Byung-gi said that it was not yet known, and the visit schedule was still under discussion.

Also on the same flight were Park Jae-myung, vice president of the Modern Industrial Group, and Kim Yun-gui, executive director.

Vice Chairman Wu Mun-han of the Central Committee of the North Korean Red Cross and relevant department heads also went to the airport to welcome Chung Ju-yung and his delegation.

Chung Ju-yung is 74 years old, born in 1915 in Tongcheon County, Gangwon Province, North Korea. He has been awarded honorary degrees in engineering and economics. In 1971, he served as the chairman of the Modern Industrial Group and is currently a consultant for the South Korean Economic Association and honorary chairman of the Modern Industrial Group.
