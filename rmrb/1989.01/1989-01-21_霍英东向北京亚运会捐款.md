To support the construction of the Asian Games facilities, Hong Kong's renowned patriot Ho Ying-tung recently decided to donate HK$100 million to the Eleventh Asian Games Foundation. Today, Beijing Mayor and Chairman of the Eleventh Asian Games Organizing Committee Chen Xitong, and Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Chairman of the Eleventh Asian Games Foundation Rong Yiren held a solemn ceremony to present Ho Ying-tung with a special honor certificate and a commemorative gift.

Deputy Mayor of Beijing and Chief Engineer of the Eleventh Asian Games Project Zhang Bai-fa expressed gratitude on behalf of the Organizing Committee to Mr. Ho Ying-tung.

It is reported that the fundraising for the Asian Games project has so far reached 200 million yuan, but there is still a significant gap to reach the fundraising target for the Asian Games project. The construction of the Asian Games facilities is still in urgent need of funds. Relevant departments hope that people from all walks of life at home and abroad will actively donate, working together to successfully host this Asian Games.

　　霍英东向北京亚运会捐款
    本报北京１月２０日讯  记者刘丽天、许正中报道：为支援亚运会工程建设，香港著名爱国人士霍英东日前决定向第十一届亚运会基金会捐赠一亿港币。今天，北京市市长、第十一届亚运会组委会主席陈希同，人大常委会副委员长、第十一届亚运会基金会会长荣毅仁举行隆重仪式，向霍英东先生授予特级荣誉证书，并赠送了纪念品。
    第十一届亚运会工程总指挥、北京市副市长张百发代表组委会向霍英东先生表示感谢。
    据悉，海内外为亚运会工程的集资目前已达２亿人民币，但离亚运会工程的集资目标还有很大距离，亚运会工程建设的资金缺口仍然很大。有关部门希望海内外各界踊跃捐资，共同办好这届亚运会。
