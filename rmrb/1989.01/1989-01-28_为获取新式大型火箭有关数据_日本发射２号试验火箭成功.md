Japan successfully launched its second test rocket on January 27 to gather data for the development of a new large rocket, the H-2, which is being developed entirely within the country.

According to Kyodo News, the second test rocket was launched at 8 AM from the space center on Tanegashima Island in Kagoshima Prefecture. Shortly after launch, two simulated solid rocket boosters, which were used to gather experimental data, separated from the main body. Subsequently, the part of the rocket carrying the data recorder fell into the sea.

The second test rocket is one-fourth the size of the H-2 large rocket, with a length of 14.3 meters, a diameter of 1.1 meters, and a weight of 11.9 tons.

The purpose of this test was to investigate air resistance, friction, vibration, and other factors during atmospheric flight; and to verify the separation performance of the simulated solid rocket boosters. Compared to the first test rocket launched in September of last year, this rocket not only carried a data recorder but also had a camera installed to capture the moment of booster separation. Therefore, it was able to obtain ten times more data than the first rocket.

    日本发射２号试验火箭成功
    新华社东京１月２７日电  日本宇宙开发事业团为获得正在研制的纯国产新式大型火箭——Ｈ２的有关数据，２７日上午发射了２号试验火箭，并取得成功。
    据共同社报道，２号试验火箭是上午８时从鹿儿岛县种子岛的宇宙中心发射的。发射后不久，取得实验数据的２支模拟固体火箭助推器从本体脱离。接着载有数据记录器的部分落在海上。
    ２号试验火箭体积是Ｈ２大型火箭的１／４，全长１４．３米，直径１．１米，重１１．９吨。
    此次试验目的是，调查在大气层飞行时空气阻力、摩擦、震动等；检验模拟固体火箭助推器的分离性能等。与去年９月发射的１号试验火箭相比，这次除携带数据记录器外，火箭上还装有摄像机，拍下了火箭分离时的瞬间情况，因此可获得比１号机多１０倍的数据。
