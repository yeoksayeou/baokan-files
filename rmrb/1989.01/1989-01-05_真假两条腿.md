In the rural roads of Qianjiaping Township in Changde City, Hunan Province, there is often a one-legged man struggling to ride a bicycle. He is the civil affairs assistant of the township government, named Hu Dingzhong. Hu Dingzhong sets a goal for himself to visit the countryside at least 250 days a year.

Hu Dingzhong, who is 40 years old this year, joined the workforce in 1971. During his time in the countryside in 1973, he contracted thrombotic obliterans, but fearing to trouble the organization and affect his work, he kept it a secret. It was not until he could no longer stand that he went to the hospital in late 1979 and had his left leg amputated. Half a year later, he requested to return to work from the organization, and the township leaders decided to have him manage civil affairs.

Hu Dingzhong does not want to stay in the office and rely on the phone to understand the situation. He is determined to go out and solve practical problems for the elderly, the sick, and the disabled. However, this is a mountainous area, with 17 villages spread over 76 square kilometers of valleys. Although Hu Dingzhong has a prosthetic leg, the true and false legs are not strong enough to climb mountains, and the prosthetic leg often causes his residual limb to bleed. Later, he modified a special bicycle, first placing the prosthetic leg on it, then getting on the bike himself. Falling off while riding with one leg is a common occurrence. His body is often bruised, but his spirit remains unbroken. He uses his true and false legs to pedal the bicycle, visiting every village and community in the township each year, and visiting over 600 retired soldiers, families of revolutionary martyrs, and five-guarantee households, as well as 13 families with disabled members. Liu Deyun, a family member of a deceased soldier in Bajiaolou Village, is old and often sick, and also has to raise a son with a mental illness, making their family life very difficult. Hu Dingzhong often pushes his bicycle, crossing four mountain ridges, traveling 40 kilometers round trip, to bring the warmth of the Party to Liu Deyun's heart.

Over the past eight years, regardless of wind, rain, scorching heat, or severe cold, Hu Dingzhong has traveled 80,000 kilometers to solve problems for the beneficiaries, inquiring about their well-being without interruption. He has used his sweat and blood to make the civil affairs work in Qianjiaping Township a model for the city and district eight times; he has also been awarded three first-class merits, one third-class merit, and promoted one grade in salary, and has been evaluated as an outstanding Communist Party member by the city and district for four consecutive years.

　　真假两条腿
　　方子珍　罗梅庭
    在湖南省常德市钱家坪乡的乡村公路上，经常有一位单腿人骑着自行车艰难地行驶。他是乡人民政府的民政助理员，名叫胡定忠。胡定忠给自己规定，每年不少于２５０天下乡走访。
    今年４０岁的胡定忠，１９７１年参加工作，１９７３年下乡蹲点期间患了闭塞性血栓型脉管炎，因为怕麻烦组织，怕影响工作，所以一直瞒着。直到不能站立，他才于１９７９年底含泪到医院锯掉了左腿。半年后他向组织上要求工作，乡领导决定让他管民政。
    胡定忠不愿意呆在办公室靠电话了解情况，决意走出去，为孤老病残人解决实际问题。可是，这里是山区，全乡１７个村分布在方圆７６平方公里的山谷里。胡定忠虽然装上了假肢，但是，真假两条腿爬山力不从心，假肢经常磨得残腿流血。后来，他改装了一辆特殊自行车，先将假腿撂上去，然后身子登车。独腿骑车，摔倒是常事。身上常常被摔得红一片紫一片，却没有摔掉他的锐气。他用真假两条腿，蹬着自行车，每年要跑遍全乡的村村组组，走访６００多位退伍军人、烈军属和五保户，走访１３个残疾人家庭。八角楼村病故军人家属刘得云年老多病，还要抚养一个有精神病的儿子，家庭生活真够困难。胡定忠经常推着自行车，翻越４座山岭，往返４０公里，把党的温暖送到刘得云的心坎上。
    ８年中，不管是刮风下雨，还是酷暑严寒，胡定忠行程８万里为优抚对象解决困难，问寒问暖，从未断过。他用汗水和鲜血，使钱家坪乡的民政工作８次被评为市、区先进单位；他也连续４年３次立大功，１次立３等功，并晋升１级工资，连续４次被市、区评为优秀共产党员。
