The Rise of the Yi Culture School

Two Yi scholars, along with several young Yi men and women, spent five years conducting surveys in more than ten counties across Yunnan, Sichuan, and Guizhou. They discovered from a large amount of firsthand materials that the 10-month solar calendar used by the Yi people in the past had a scientific accuracy superior to the current Gregorian calendar. This calendar divides a year into five seasons and ten months, with each month having 36 days, totaling 360 days, and the remaining five days as "New Year's Days." The days in each month are evenly distributed, and the seasons are accurate. They also verified that the three-tiered circular pyramid-shaped ancient tombs known as "tianfen" (tombs facing the sky) in Yi areas are all located on mountains with a north-south orientation. From the top of the tomb, one can observe the movement of the sun to determine the winter and summer solstices, and from the bottom, one can observe the direction of the Big Dipper to determine the seasons. This research, published in 1985, led some scholars to excitedly point out that among the world's four great ancient civilizations, traditionally considered to be Egypt, Babylon, India, and China, the Yi 10-month calendar can be traced back to the time of the Yi ancestors, the Tiger Fu Xi clan, around six to seven thousand years ago. This proves that the emergence of Chinese civilization is not later than the other three ancient civilizations.

These two scholars are Sōu Yáohàn, the director, and Lú Yāng, the deputy director, of the first minority research institute in China—Yunnan Academy of Social Sciences Chuxiong Yi Culture Research Institute.

When I went to Chuxiong for an interview, it happened that Professor Sōu was invited to lecture in the United States, and Professor Lú was also away. I was unable to meet them, which was regrettable. However, the enthusiastic discussions with other Yi scholars compensated me with a wealth of information I had never heard before.

Deputy Director Yáng Hé Sēn and Ān Wú Hé told me that in the past, under the influence of "leftist" ideology, the excavation and research of Yi culture had long been neglected and stagnant. During the ten-year Cultural Revolution, many Yi scriptures were burned as superstitious items. After the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee, the Party's ethnic policies were gradually implemented, and ethnic studies became a hot topic in the social sciences. In 1979, the Yunnan Academy of Social Sciences established the Yi script translation group in Chuxiong, which later developed into the Yi Culture Research Room. In 1984, it was upgraded to the Research Institute. The first Yi professor in New China, Sōu Yáohàn, a researcher at the Institute of Ethnic Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, served as the director. Of the 16 researchers in the institute, 15 are Yi. Studying their own ethnic culture, with a common language and emotions, makes it easier to delve deeper. Under the leadership of Director Sōu, the entire institute did not follow the path of research from books to books but combined field surveys, ancient book research, and underground archaeological research. They conducted long-term in-depth investigations in the vast Yi areas, emphasizing the acquisition of firsthand materials. Based on these materials full of "wild flavor," many colleagues boldly explored areas that previous scholars had not touched, forming their own academic characteristics.

In recent years, after the publication of two books by Sōu Yáohàn and Lú Yāng, "New Exploration of the Origins of Chinese Civilization" and "The Yi 10-Month Calendar of Civilized China," the Chuxiong Yi Culture Research Institute has completed more than ten monographs, including "Totem Hierarchy Theory," "Market Origin Theory," "The Philosophical and Scientific Significance of Yi Tiger Star Divination," and "Yi Place Names and Chinese Ethnic Geography." The research institute compiled these monographs into the "Yi Culture Research Series," planning to publish up to 30 volumes. Since 1984, the institute has annually compiled academic achievements in the fields of Yi history and culture, social surveys, and development issues, publishing the comprehensive academic annual "Yi Culture," with a total of six volumes, each around 300 pages.

The rise of this Yi academic team and the fresh breeze they brought into the academic world have won the wide attention and praise of scholars in the fields of sociology and ethnology. The concept of the "Chinese Yi Culture School" has been widely accepted by relevant scholars and experts.

The institute also gathered some "local scholars"—"Bimo." Bimo are priests of Yi primitive religion. In the past, only they knew Yi script and had a large number of sacrificial books passed down. These sacrificial books not only recorded various sacrificial rituals but also reflected the Yi ancestors' understanding of natural science and history. For a long time, Bimo were regarded as superstitious practitioners and often persecuted. In 1982, the state government held the first Bimo symposium, exonerated them, affirmed that they were preservers, inheritors, and disseminators of Yi culture, and were important objects for rescuing Yi traditional culture. With the support of Bimo, the institute collected more than a thousand sacrificial books, and some Bimo with higher cultural levels were also invited to participate in translation work.

Interestingly, the influence of the Yi Culture School has spread overseas, with scholars from five countries visiting here 13 times. In Japan, there has been a saying that the origin of the Japanese ethnic group is related to the Yi in Yunnan. Mr. Makiba Kimiya, the chief priest of the Usa Shrine in Japan, has long been studying the origin of Shinto, and some problems have remained unsolved for many years. Once, he accidentally read "The History of Yi Astronomy" by Sōu Yáohàn and others, and suddenly understood, regarding it as a divine revelation. He visited the Chuxiong Yi Culture Research Institute in 1987 and also observed a simulated performance of Yi sacrificial rituals. He wrote that the Yi's worship of the Big Dipper constellation has a clear historical origin with Japan's worship of the North Star, and the "inserting of firewood" in Japanese rituals comes from the Yi sacrificial ritual of inserting tree branches to mark the constellation's changes. The relationship between Yi culture and the Maya culture of the Americas has also attracted the attention of some scholars. They pointed out that the Maya solar calendar, with 18 months of 20 days each year, also treats the remaining five days as taboo days, just like the Yi solar calendar, which is not affected by the lunar calendar's 12 months each year; both Maya culture and Yi culture use the tiger as a totem; the three-tiered pyramids placed by the Maya to worship the day god are surprisingly similar in design to some Yi tombs facing the sky; the rows of Maya script are also from left to right and from top to bottom, just like Yi script. Yi culture may become a key to solving the mystery of ancient American civilization.

"The historical origin relationship between Yi culture and some ancient cultures overseas, we have not yet conducted a special study, so we cannot draw any conclusions," said the colleagues of the research institute modestly. "However, the influence and contribution of ancient Yi culture to world civilization are definitely not limited to the scope we have touched and recognized so far. In front of this young team, there are still vast fields waiting to be explored."

　　“彝族文化学派”的崛起
    本报记者  朱维群
    两位彝族学者，带领几名彝族男女青年，历经５个寒暑，深入滇、川、黔十余县的彝山调查，他们从大量的第一手材料中惊喜地发现：彝族人民在过去漫长岁月中创造、使用过的１０月太阳历，其科学性优于现行公历。这种历法将一年分为５季１０个月，各月均３６天，合计３６０天，余下５天作为“过年日”，各月日数整齐，季节准确。他们同时还证实，彝族地区普遍存在的３层圆台金字塔型古墓“向天坟”，所在山势皆南北走向，踞墓上南可观太阳运动定冬夏，北可观斗柄指向定寒暑，具有观象台或天文台的功能。这一研究成果１９８５年成书发表后，一些学者兴奋地指出：世界４大文明古国，素以埃及、巴比伦、印度、中国为序，而彝族１０月历可以追溯到彝族原始先民虎伏羲氏部落时代，即六七千年以前，这足以证明中国文明的产生绝不晚于其他３个文明古国。
    这两位学者，就是我国第一个少数民族研究所——云南社会科学院楚雄彝族文化研究所的正、副所长刘尧汉研究员和卢央副教授。
    我到楚雄采访时，适逢刘先生应邀在美国讲学，卢先生也远在外地。未能识荆，深为遗憾。但其他彝族学者们的热情接谈，教我知道了不少闻所未闻的东西，又给了我丰厚的补偿。
    副所长杨和森、安伍合告诉我，过去在“左”的思想干扰下，彝族文化发掘研究工作长期处于被漠视和停滞的境地。在１０年浩劫中，不少彝文古籍被当作迷信品付之一炬。党的十一届三中全会以后，党的民族政策逐步落实，民族学研究也成为社会科学界的热门。１９７９年云南社会科学院在楚雄设立了彝文翻译小组，后发展为彝族文化研究室，到１９８４年再度升格为研究所。新中国第一个彝族教授、中国社会科学院民族研究所研究员刘尧汉担任所长。全所１６名研究人员中１５名是彝族，研究本民族文化，语言、感情相通，更容易深入。在刘所长主持下，全所人员没有走从书本到书本的研究路子，而是将实地调查、古籍考证和地下文物考古３者相结合，长期深入广大彝区，重视掌握第一手资料。依据这些充满“山野味”的材料，许多同志大胆探索一些前人未曾涉及的领域，形成了自己的学术特色。
    近几年来，楚雄彝族文化研究所继刘尧汉、卢央等所著《中国文明源头新探》、《文明中国的彝族十月历》两书出版之后，又完成了《图腾层次论》、《市场起源论》、《彝族虎星占的哲学和科学意义》、《彝族支地名与中国民族地名学》等１０余部专著。研究所将这批专著汇编为《彝族文化研究丛书》，预计将出至３０本。从１９８４年起，研究所每年汇集所内外有关彝族历史文化、社会调查、发展问题研究等领域的成果，出版综合性学术年刊《彝族文化》，迄今已出版６大本，每期均在３００页左右。
    这支彝族学术队伍的崛起和他们带进学术界的清新之风，赢得社会学、民族学界人士的广泛重视和好评。“中华彝族文化学派”的提法被有关学者专家普遍接受。
    在研究所里还聚集着一些“土学者”——“毕摩”。毕摩是彝族原始宗教的祭司，过去彝族中只有他们识得彝文，并有大量祭书家传。这些祭书除了记载各种祭祀规矩，也反映了彝族先民对自然科学和历史的认识。长期以来毕摩被视为迷信职业者屡遭打击。１９８２年州政府召开首次毕摩座谈会，为他们平反，肯定他们是彝族文化的保存者、继承者和传播者，是抢救彝族传统文化的重要依靠对象。在毕摩们的支持下，研究所收集到祭书上千本，一些文化水平较高的毕摩还被吸收参加翻译工作。
    饶有兴趣的是，彝族文化学派的影响已扩展到海外，先后有５个国家的学者１３次访问这里。在日本，曾有日本民族起源与云南彝族有关的说法。日本宇佐神宫祭史马场纪美史先生长期研究日本神道起源，有些难题多年不得其解，一次偶然读到刘尧汉等著《彝族天文学史》，豁然开朗，视为神示，遂于１９８７年专程访问楚雄彝族文化研究所，又参观了彝族祭奠仪式的模拟表演。他著文认为，彝族的北斗星座崇拜与日本北辰崇拜有明显历史渊源关系，日本神事中的“插柴”，是从彝族祭祀插树枝神座以标志星座演变而来。彝族文化与美洲印第安人玛雅文化的关系也日益引起一些学者的关注。他们指出：玛雅人的太阳历，１年１８个月，一个月２０天，也将剩余５天作为禁忌日，与彝族太阳历都是不受太阴历每年１２个月影响的纯阳历；玛雅文化与彝族文化都以虎作为图腾；玛雅人供置历日神的三台金字塔与彝族一些向天坟设计惊人相似；玛雅文的行列也与彝文一样由左到右，由上到下。彝族文化很可能成为解开美洲古文明之谜的一把钥匙。
    “彝族文化与海外某些古文化的历史渊源关系，目前我们还没有进行专题研究，不好下什么结论”，研究所的同志谦逊地说：“不过，古老的彝族文化对世界文明的影响和贡献，肯定不止于我们目前涉及和已认识的范围。在我们这支年轻的队伍面前，还有着广阔的领域待探索。”
