African diplomats stationed in Beijing and African public opinion believe that the conflict between African students studying in China and Chinese students should not affect the friendly relations between China and Africa.

A high-level diplomat from an unnamed African country told a Reuters correspondent in Beijing on January 2, "We must work with our Chinese friends to solve these problems. We have a good cooperative relationship with China. Despite its large population, China provides excellent learning conditions for our students."

He also said that African diplomats praise China for providing scholarships to African students. He hopes that African countries will continue to send students to study in China.

The Kenyan newspaper *The Standard* published an editorial on January 3 stating that the conflict between African students and Chinese students is regrettable; however, "the primary issue is that China and Africa have mutual needs and should not allow this conflict to hinder the friendly relations that already exist between African countries and China."

Zambian Foreign Minister Mwamwanishi recently commented on this incident, saying that Zambia's relationship with China is very good.

On December 24 last year, a few African students studying at Nanjing River and Sea University had a conflict with Chinese students.

　　驻京非洲外交官和非洲舆论认为
    “南京事件”不应影响中非友好关系
    新华社北京１月４日电  驻北京的一些非洲国家外交官和非洲舆论认为，留华非洲学生和中国学生发生冲突事件不应该影响中、非友好关系。
    一位没有透露姓名的非洲国家高级外交官２日对路透社驻京记者发表谈话说：“我们必须同我们的中国朋友共同解决这些问题。我们同中国有良好的合作关系。中国尽管自己人口众多，还为我们的学生提供了极好的学习条件。”
    他还说，非洲外交官赞扬中国为非洲学生提供奖学金。他希望非洲国家将继续派留学生到中国来学习。
    肯尼亚《旗帜报》３日发表社论说，非洲学生和中国学生发生冲突事件令人遗憾；然而，“首要的问题是，中国和非洲彼此互有需要，不应该允许这场冲突妨碍非洲国家和中国之间业已存在的友好关系”。
    赞比亚外长姆瓦南希库最近就这一事件发表评论说，赞比亚与中国关系非常好。
    去年１２月２４日晚，在南京河海大学学习的几名非洲留学生同中国学生发生了冲突。
