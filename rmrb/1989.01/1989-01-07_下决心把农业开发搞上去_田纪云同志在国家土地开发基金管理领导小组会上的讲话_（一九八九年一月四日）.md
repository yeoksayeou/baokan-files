Edition: 2

Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, our country's agricultural production has indeed reached a new level. With relatively little arable land, we have been able to feed nearly one-fifth of the world's population. We should fully recognize the significant role that the past decade of reform has played in promoting agricultural development.

However, currently, our agriculture is facing three major challenges: first, the population is growing, while arable land is decreasing; second, the consumption of grain-derived products is increasing rapidly, with meat, poultry, eggs, and milk all primarily coming from grain, thus increasing the demand for grain; third, a significant portion of our foreign exchange earnings comes from agricultural products, and the stagnation in agriculture is affecting our export supply.

How can we push agricultural production to a new level? Simply focusing on conventional agriculture is not enough. We must more fully and effectively utilize agricultural resources and carry out large-scale comprehensive agricultural development. This includes two aspects: first, deep development, which involves improving the yield per unit area; second, broad development, which involves utilizing new agricultural resources.

Agricultural development relies on three factors: policy, science, and investment. Therefore, we must adopt new methods, that is, we must take the development of a commodity economy as our guiding ideology, use economic means to carry out development, and forge a new path for agricultural development that suits China's national conditions.

Agricultural development is a matter of great concern to everyone. Now, I would like to share some of my views on this issue.

1. China's Agriculture Faces New Challenges

Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, driven by reform, we have relied on policy, science, and investment to liberate rural productivity and mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers, resulting in significant development in agricultural production. We have basically solved the problem of feeding 1 billion people, which is a remarkable achievement and a feat that has attracted worldwide attention. With limited arable land, we have managed to feed nearly one-fifth of the world's population and have provided the material foundation and conditions for the development of China's industry and for the progress of reform and opening up. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, agricultural production has indeed reached a new level. Grain production has increased from 300 billion kilograms to over 400 billion kilograms, cotton production has increased from over 40 million piculs to a peak of 1.2 billion piculs, and other economic crops have all increased by several times. These are facts. If you close your eyes and think about it, or if you walk around and observe, you will see the changes from ten years ago and understand them clearly.

We must fully recognize the role that the past decade of reform has played in promoting agriculture and the conditions that agricultural development has provided for our reform and social development. However, we must not be satisfied with these achievements or stop at the current level. We must face the new challenges in agriculture.

What are these new challenges? First, China's population is increasing by over 10 million people per year, equivalent to the population of a medium-sized country, while arable land is decreasing by several million mu per year, which is a very serious situation. Second, with the development of the economy and the improvement of people's living standards, the demand for grain and grain-derived products, as well as other agricultural products, has significantly increased. It is not just that some people's grain consumption is now less than it was in the 1950s and 1960s during the difficult times; in reality, grain consumption has greatly increased, and the consumption of grain-derived products has also greatly increased. Whether it is milk, eggs, or meat, they are basically all derived from grain. The proportion of truly grass-fed animals in our meat supply is very small. Currently, our grain consumption is increasing by 100 to 150 billion kilograms per year, while grain production is stagnating. Of course, we can take some measures to control grain consumption, but the gradual increase in consumption is irreversible. Third, with the implementation of the open-door policy and the coastal development strategy, our international exchanges have expanded, and the demand for foreign exchange has greatly increased. We need to export goods to earn foreign exchange. Currently, half of our foreign exchange comes from agricultural products and their processed products, but the main agricultural products are stagnating, which will inevitably affect the export supply. This is a new situation. The state of foreign trade not only affects industrial development but will ultimately affect agricultural development. These are the new challenges we face in agriculture. This new situation requires us to push agricultural production to a new level, as proposed at this rural work conference.

2. Plan and Implement Comprehensive Agricultural Resource Development

Under this new situation, how can we push agricultural production to a new level? The rural work conference held in November last year made a relatively systematic deployment, and we will act according to the spirit of this conference and take multiple measures to make efforts in various aspects. Currently, it seems that simply focusing on conventional agriculture is not enough. We must more fully and effectively utilize our agricultural resources and carry out large-scale comprehensive agricultural development. I believe that this is a strategic measure to achieve the agricultural development goals by the end of this century and to maintain the continuous and stable development of China's agriculture. It is also a new task and the hope for the development of China's agriculture. If we do well, we can create a new situation for China's agriculture. The significance of this matter must be fully recognized, highly valued, and never underestimated. If we do not resolutely promote agricultural development, achieving the agricultural development goals by the end of this century will be very difficult.

The agricultural development we are talking about includes two aspects: first, deep development, which involves transforming existing medium and low-yield fields, making more reasonable and full use of existing agricultural resources, and improving agricultural productivity and yield per unit area. In a certain period, this is the main aspect. Second, broad development, which means that relying solely on existing resources is not enough. Before science makes a major breakthrough, the increase in yield per unit area is inevitably limited. While fully and effectively utilizing existing resources, we must develop and utilize new agricultural resources. Natural resources must be utilized; otherwise, they will not produce significant benefits if left idle. The key is not to utilize them blindly but to utilize them scientifically and rationally.

We propose to vigorously promote agricultural development not blindly but based on sufficient grounds.

First, China's agricultural resources have great potential for development. China currently has 1.5 billion mu of arable land, of which 800 million mu are medium and low-yield fields, accounting for more than half. If the yield per mu is increased by 25 kilograms, then 200 billion kilograms of grain can be increased. The Huang-Huai-Hai region has over 200 million mu of medium and low-yield fields. I recently visited Jiangxi and Hunan, where Jiangxi has 30 million mu of paddy fields, of which 20 million mu are medium and low-yield fields. If these medium and low-yield fields are transformed, 15 to 20 billion kilograms of rice can be increased annually. This shows that the potential for increasing yield per unit area in our existing arable land is considerable. On the other hand, there are still many wastelands, barren hills, barren waters, and barren beaches that can be developed and utilized. According to statistics from relevant departments, China has about 500 million mu of arable wasteland, 20 million mu of unused tidal flats, approximately 30 million mu of freshwater aquaculture areas, over 10 billion mu of barren hills and slopes suitable for afforestation, and 700 million mu of grasslands suitable for grazing. Each region has some agricultural resources that can be developed. Jiangxi Province has over 10 million mu of arable wasteland that can be reclaimed. In the three regions of southern Hunan, there are 9 million mu of wasteland that can be reclaimed, of which over 3 million mu are arable wasteland with a slope of less than 15 degrees. This means that we have sufficient conditions for development and that we have "rice to cook," not "no rice to cook."

Second, we also have certain financial conditions. The Central Committee and the State Council have decided to gradually establish an agricultural development fund starting this year, which will be included in the budget by all levels of finance, listed for revenue and expenditure, and used for specific purposes. To promote agricultural development, the state has established a land development fund. At the same time, local governments will also gradually increase their investment in agriculture, and the masses have accumulated a certain amount of funds. These will all provide a relatively stable source of funds for agricultural development.

Third, our agricultural development has been practiced and has some experience to draw upon. Since the founding of the nation, some places have carried out agricultural development. Some agricultural development projects in the Huang-Huai-Hai region have been ongoing for over a decade. Starting last year, we have planned and focused on the development of the Sanjiang Plain, the Huang-Huai-Hai region, and the sugar and cotton bases in Guangxi, Xinjiang, and Yunnan, as well as the coastal tidal flats in Shandong, involving 11 provinces and regions. A year of practice has allowed various places to explore some experiences, and good results have already been achieved. Last year, 10 provinces and regions started the transformation of 11.36 million mu of medium and low-yield fields, of which 6 million mu have been completed; 3.41 million mu of arable wasteland have been reclaimed, with 2.83 million mu completed, exceeding the plan by nearly 7%. The sugar production in Guangxi and the sugar and cotton production in Xinjiang have achieved significant results last year. The practice in these regions shows that promoting agricultural development is not only necessary but also feasible.

Fourth, local governments and the broad masses of farmers are enthusiastic about developing agriculture. The experience of several dozen households in Huan County, Gansu Province, in contracting and operating on a large scale is very convincing, as it has provided more commodities for the state and enriched the farmers. This time, I visited southern Hunan and Jiangxi and saw that some places have taken the initiative to start their own projects. In Guiyang County, a farmer has contracted to reclaim 40 mu of wasteland and is currently cultivating it with great enthusiasm.

In summary, whether looking at some regions or the whole country, agricultural development is inevitable and has great potential. First, the potential is great; second, the conditions are good; third, cadres and the masses are enthusiastic, and there is consensus from top to bottom. Now it depends on whether we have the will, the determination, and the courage to lead and organize the masses to undertake this arduous and great task. From now on, we must put agricultural development on the agenda. We must make a great effort, with strong willpower, to vigorously promote the development of agricultural resources, and we must persist and achieve results. Through the full utilization of existing resources and the development of new agricultural resources, we can push agricultural production to a new level to meet the needs of the Four Modernizations, the improvement of people's living standards, and reform and opening up.

3. Use the Concept of a Commodity Economy and Economic Methods to Guide, Organize, and Implement Agricultural Development

Developing agriculture relies on three factors: policy, science, and investment. Agricultural development is the same. Our current agricultural development is very different from past agricultural development and can be considered a new endeavor. Therefore, we must adopt new methods, that is, we must take the development of a commodity economy as our guiding ideology, use economic means to carry out development, and forge a new path for agricultural development that suits China's national conditions. In summary, we should grasp the following points:

First, we must have the correct guiding principles. One is unified planning and concentrated development. All large-scale development projects should be planned this way. Without planning, everyone will do their own thing, which will easily damage the ecological environment, waste resources, and is not conducive to improving efficiency. Two is to proceed according to local conditions and actual situations. That is, in new development areas, if it is suitable for grain, then grain; if it is suitable for livestock, then livestock; if it is suitable for forestry, then forestry; if it is suitable for fisheries, then fisheries, but grain production must not be neglected; in development methods, we must also proceed according to actual situations, with some focusing on transforming medium and low-yield fields, some focusing on reclamation, and some focusing on soil improvement; in crop varieties, some should focus on developing rice production, some should focus on wheat production, and some should focus on corn production, and we must proceed according to local conditions; agricultural development cannot be one-sided, with some combining the establishment of commodity bases, some combining poverty alleviation, and some combining water and soil conservation. Three is to implement graded contracting and large-scale operation. New agricultural resource development must implement appropriate large-scale operation and not distribute one or two mu to each household after development. Large-scale contracting, joint contracting, and state farms can be implemented, but not the collective style of the past people's communes. In agricultural development, we must attach importance to and give full play to the role of the agricultural reclamation department and state farms. Whether it is family operation, joint operation, or state and collective farm operation, there must be a certain scale. A family operating thousands of mu is probably difficult, but tens of mu or hundreds of mu is possible, and in areas with more arable land, it can be even more. Only with a certain scale can we improve economic efficiency and provide more commodities. Four is to implement operational and open development. We cannot follow the old path of only investing and not recovering or increasing value. We must introduce a competitive mechanism, implement bidding, and adhere to the principle of "who develops, who benefits." Development funds must be linked to benefits. Operational funds must be used for profit, circulated, and rolled over, so that one yuan can be used for several yuan. Agricultural development must adhere to the principle of public assistance and private management. This is a matter for the masses, and fundamentally, it is also a matter of the masses' interests. It mainly relies on the masses to do it, and the state provides support. Labor accumulation is a very important investment, and the masses now also have a certain amount of financial accumulation. Development must be closely linked to the interests of the masses, and the masses are willing to invest. We must collect development funds from multiple levels, channels, and forms. By multiple levels, we mean from the central government, provinces, prefectures, cities, counties, to the masses; by multiple channels, we mean various industries, within the province, outside the province, within the country, outside the country, not only utilizing domestic funds but also appropriately utilizing some foreign funds; by multiple forms, we mean that individuals can invest, joint investments can be made, and inter-provincial compensatory trade can also be carried out. Five is to implement comprehensive development. We must comprehensively utilize regional natural resources, implement the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries, and comprehensively manage soil, water, fields, forests, and roads. Development must attach importance to agriculture, but it is not just about developing agriculture; it must attach importance to grain, but it is not just about developing grain production. Forestry, water conservancy, and corresponding agricultural product processing must also be given their due positions. The agricultural development fund should include a certain proportion for water conservancy and forestry. The development of the "vegetable basket project," that is, the development of sideline food production, should also be given certain support. Six is to attach importance to scientific and technological investment. This is very important. New agricultural development cannot rely solely on traditional farming methods. We must attach importance to and promote the application of advanced agricultural farming technologies and research results. Without this, agricultural development will definitely not be successful, and efficiency will not be improved. Seven is to attach great importance to protecting the ecological environment. Agricultural development is the scientific and rational utilization of natural resources and must not damage natural resources. Agricultural development emphasizes efficiency, which includes ecological efficiency. We must do a good job of demonstration work in advance and have protective measures for the ecological environment.

Second, we must implement correct policies to encourage and mobilize the enthusiasm of all levels and the broad masses of farmers to invest in development. The policies for developing the Sanjiang Plain and the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain are also applicable to the agricultural development of other regions. For newly developed land and newly transformed medium and low-yield fields, preferential policies will be implemented in terms of taxation, pricing, and other aspects. The state will also give consideration to the allocation of production materials to the development regions and will allocate a certain amount of development loans and support funds each year. We must carefully study which projects should be undertaken by the state and which can be undertaken by the masses themselves. Large and medium-sized water conservancy projects cannot be undertaken by the masses themselves, but small reservoirs and irrigation canals can be undertaken by the masses. Road construction, energy, and some relatively large agricultural product processing facilities need state support or investment to undertake.

Third, we must strengthen leadership and guidance and organizational work. Local governments can organize a leading group to handle this matter, with a small and efficient office under the leading group to specifically handle this work, but we should not establish companies at each level. Establishing companies often means doing what is profitable, easily neglecting agricultural projects, and spending money to maintain a group of people. It is better to concentrate the limited funds on agricultural development. Of course, project contracting can establish economic entities. We must strengthen the management of agricultural development funds. Agricultural development funds must be allocated and used with a focus on efficiency, with local matching funds guaranteed and not falling through; funds must be allocated according to projects and then managed by a single department; we must establish and improve systems and regulations, strengthen inspections and supervision, and agricultural development funds can only be used for agricultural development and cannot be diverted to other uses.

Fourth, we must proceed step by step and in a planned manner. We have many resources that can be developed, but currently, our financial and other strengths are limited, and we cannot spread out everywhere. We must prioritize using limited funds in areas with great potential, quick results, and high efficiency, and develop one area after another in a planned manner, starting with the easiest and moving to the most difficult. Last year, we focused on developing six or seven key areas, including the Sanjiang Plain and the Huang-Huai-Hai region, and this year, we must also focus on developing a few areas.

This meeting has proposed some preliminary opinions, which can be further demonstrated and quickly negotiated with relevant provinces and regions to formulate specific plans and implement them as soon as possible, so that agricultural development this year can achieve even more satisfactory progress.

　　下决心把农业开发搞上去
    ——田纪云同志在国家土地开发基金管理领导小组会上的讲话
    （一九八九年一月四日）
    内容提要：党的十一届三中全会以后，我国农业生产确实登上了一个新的台阶。我们以较少的耕地养活了差不多占世界１／５的人口。对于这１０年改革对农业的促进作用，应予以充分认识。
    但是，当前我国农业面临三个方面的挑战：一是人口在增长，耕地在减少；二是粮食转化物的消费增加很快，肉禽蛋奶基本都靠粮食转化而来，因而增加了对粮食的需求量；三是我国创汇产品中相当部分是农产品，农业徘徊影响了出口货源。
    如何使农业生产再登上一个新台阶？仅在常规农业中打圈子是不行的，必须更充分、更有效地利用农业资源，进行大规模的综合农业开发。这包括两方面：一是深度开发，提高单产；二是广度开发，利用新的农业资源。
    开发农业一靠政策，二靠科学，三靠投入。因而必须采取新办法，也就是要以发展商品经济为指导思想，用经济办法进行开发，走出一条符合我国国情的农业开发新路。
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    农业开发是大家都很关心的问题，现在我就这个问题讲点意见。
  　一、我国农业面临着新的挑战
    党的十一届三中全会以来，我们在改革的推动下，靠政策，靠科学，靠投入，解放了农村生产力，调动了广大农民的积极性，使农业生产得到了很大的发展。我们基本解决了１０亿人民的温饱问题，这应该说是一个了不起的成就，是举世瞩目的成就。耕地少，这是我们的基本国情。然而，就在这种情况下，我们养活了差不多占世界１／５的人口，而且为我国工业的发展，为改革、开放提供了物资基础和条件，促进了社会的进步和发展。十一届三中全会以后，农业生产确实登上了一个新的台阶。粮食产量由３０００亿公斤搞到４０００多亿公斤，棉花由４０００多万担搞到最高水平１．２亿担，其他经济作物都是成倍或几倍地增长。这是活生生的事实。如果你闭上眼睛想一想，或者迈开双脚到各地走一走，看一看，对十年前后的变化，就会一清二楚，一目了然。
    我们要充分认识十年改革对农业的促进作用，以及农业的发展为我们的改革和社会发展提供的条件。但是，不能满足于这个成就，不能停留在现有水平上，必须正视我们在农业问题上面临着新的挑战。
    新的挑战是什么呢？第一，我国人口一年以一千几百万的速度在增加，相当于一个中等国家的人口；而耕地每年却以几百万亩的速度在减少，这是一个十分严重的情况。第二，随着经济的发展和人民生活水平的提高，对粮食和粮食转化物以及对其他农产品的需求大大增加。不要只看现在有些人吃粮食的数量比５０年代和６０年代困难时期可能都少，但现在实际粮食消费量大大提高了，粮食转化物的消费大大增加了。人们吃的牛奶也好，吃的鸡蛋也好，吃的肉也好，基本上都是粮食转化来的，真正草食动物占我们的肉类供应比重很小。目前，我们的粮食消费一年以１００亿公斤到１５０亿公斤的幅度在增加，而粮食生产却在徘徊。当然，我们可以采取一些措施节制粮食的消费，但消费量的逐步增长则是不可逆转的。第三，随着开放政策的实施，随着沿海地区经济发展战略的实施，我们同国际的交往扩大了，外汇的需求量大大增加了，我们需要出口东西换取外汇。我们现在的外汇一半是靠农产品及其制成品换取的，但主要农产品生产出现徘徊，出口货源必然受到影响。这是一个新的情况。外贸的状况如何，不仅影响工业的发展，而且最终将会影响农业发展。这就是我们在农业问题上面临的新挑战。这种新的形势要求什么呢？就是这次农村工作会议所提出的，要求我们的农业生产必须再攀登一个新的台阶。
    二、有计划有步骤地进行农业资源的综合开发
    在这个新的形势之下，如何使农业生产再登上一个新的台阶呢？去年１１月召开的农村工作会议作了比较系统的部署，我们将根据这次会议的精神，采取多种措施，做多方面的努力。现在看来仅在常规农业中打圈子是不行的，必须更充分、更有效地利用我们的农业资源，进行大规模的综合农业开发。我认为，这是实现本世纪末我国农业发展目标，保持我国农业持续稳定发展的一项战略性措施，也是一项新的任务，是发展我国农业的希望所在，搞得好，就会使我国农业开创一个新的局面。对这件事的意义，一定要充分认识，高度重视，决不可低估。如果不下决心抓农业开发，实现本世纪末农业发展目标将是很困难的。
    我们讲的农业开发包括两个方面：一是深度开发，即改造现有的中低产田，更加合理、更加充分地利用现有农业资源，提高农业生产率和单位面积产量。在一定时期，这是主导方面。二是广度开发，就是说，仅仅靠现有资源是不够的，在科学没有大的突破之前，单产的提高毕竟是有限度的，在充分有效地利用现有资源的同时，必须开发利用新的农业资源。自然资源是要利用的，不然放在那里是不会产生大的效益的，关键是不能盲目利用，而要科学的合理的利用。
    我们提出大力推进农业开发不是盲目的，是有足够根据的。
    一是，我国农业资源的开发潜力很大。我国现有耕地１５亿亩，其中中低产田有８亿多亩，占一半以上，如果亩产提高２５公斤，那么就增产２００多亿公斤粮食。黄淮海有中低产田２亿多亩。我最近到江西、湖南看一下，江西现有３０００万亩水田，其中２０００万亩属中低产田，如果把中低产田加以改造，每年就可多提供１５亿至２０亿公斤稻谷。这说明，我们现有耕地提高单产的潜力是相当大的。这是一方面。另一方面，我们尚可开发利用的荒地、荒坡、荒山、荒水和荒滩还是很多的。据有关方面大体统计，我国有宜农荒地约５亿亩，未利用的海涂２０００万亩、淡水可养殖水面约３０００多万亩，有宜林荒山、荒坡１０多亿亩，宜牧草山草坡７亿亩。各地都有一些农业资源可以开发。江西省有可垦宜农荒地１０００多万亩。湖南省的湘南３个地区可垦荒地有９００万亩，其中１５度以下宜农荒地有３００多万亩。这就是说，我们的开发是有充分条件的，是有米之炊，不是“无米之炊”。
    二是，在财力上也具备一定的条件。中央和国务院决定，从今年起逐步建立农业发展基金，由各级财政纳入预算，列收列支，专款专用。为了搞好农业开发，国家设立了土地开发基金。同时，各地也将相应逐步增加对农业的投入，群众也有一定的资金积累。这些都将会使农业开发有较为稳定的资金来源。
    三是，我们的农业开发已经过实践，有一定经验可借鉴。建国以来，我们一些地方搞过农业开发。黄淮海地区有些农业开发项目搞了十多年了。从去年开始，我们有计划地重点地抓了三江平原、黄淮海地区的开发和广西、新疆、云南糖、棉基地开发及山东沿海滩涂开发，范围涉及１１个省、区。一年的实践，各地也探索了一些经验，而且已收到较好效果。去年，１０个省、区开工改造中低产田１１３６万亩，其中已完成６００万亩；开垦宜农荒地３４１万亩，完成２８３万亩，超过计划近７％。广西糖料生产和新疆糖棉生产，去年收到明显效果。这些地区的实践说明，推进农业开发不仅是必要的，而且也是可行的。
    四是，各地和广大农民都有开发农业的积极性。甘肃省河西地区环县四十几户农民承包开发、规模经营的经验很有说服力，既为国家多提供了商品，又富裕了农民。我这次到湘南、江西看到，一些地方自己主动搞起来了，桂阳县一个农民承包开荒就达４０亩，正在开垦，很有积极性。
    总之，不论从一些地区看，还是从全国看，农业开发是势在必行，大有可为。一是潜力很大，二是条件较好，三是干部、群众都有积极性，上下认识一致。现在就看我们有没有毅力，有没有决心，有没有魄力去领导群众、组织群众干这番艰巨而伟大的事业。我们从现在开始，就必须把农业开发提到议事日程上来。要下大的决心，以坚强的毅力，大抓狠抓农业资源的开发，而且要持之以恒，抓出成效。通过对现有资源的充分利用，通过开发新的农业资源，使农业生产能够再攀一个新的台阶，以适应四化建设的需要，适应人民生活改善的需要，适应改革、开放的需要。
    三、要用商品经济观念和经济的方法指导、组织和实施农业开发
    发展农业，一靠政策，二靠科学，三靠投入，搞农业开发同样要靠这三条。我们现在搞的农业开发，同过去的农业开发有很大的不同，可以说是一项新的事业，因此，必须采取新的办法。就是要以发展商品经济为指导思想，用经济办法进行开发，走出一条符合我们国家实际情况的农业开发的新路子。概括讲，是不是把握这么几条：
    第一，要有正确的指导方针。一是统一规划，集中开发。凡是成片较大规模的开发，都应这么做。不能没有规划，各行其是，那样既容易破坏生态环境，又易造成资源的浪费，也不利于提高效益。二是因地制宜，从实际出发。就是新开发地区，宜粮则粮，宜牧则牧，宜林则林，宜渔则渔，但决不可忽视粮食生产；在开发方式上也要从实际出发，有的可以改造中低产田为主，有的可以开荒为主，有的可以改土为主；在作物品种上，有的应以发展水稻生产为主，有的应以生产小麦为主，有的应以发展玉米为主，也要因地制宜；农业开发，不能单打一，有的要和建立商品基地相结合，有的要与扶贫相结合，有的要与水土保持相结合。三是，分级承包，规模经营。新的农业资源开发，一定要搞适度规模经营，不要开发以后就一亩两亩地分到一家一户。可以搞大户承包，搞联户承包，搞集体农场，但不能搞过去人民公社式的那种集体。在农业开发中，要重视和发挥农垦部门和国营农场的作用。无论是家庭经营、联户经营，或是国营、集体农场经营，都要有一定的规模。一个家庭搞上千亩那种规模大概是困难的，但是几十亩、百把亩的规模是可以的，耕地面积多的地方还可以更多一点，只有具有一定的规模，才利于提高经济效益，才能够提供更多的商品。四是，实行经营式、开放式开发。不能再走过去那种只投入，不收回，不增值的老路子。要引入竞争机制，实行招标，坚持谁开发，谁受益的原则。开发资金投入要与效益挂钩。属于经营性资金，一定要有偿使用，循环滚动，这样一个钱就顶几个钱用。农业开发，要坚持民办公助原则。这个事业是群众的事业，从根本上讲也是群众的利益，主要靠群众来干，国家给予扶持。劳动积累是很重要的投入，而且群众现在也有一定的资金积累。开发只要同群众的利益紧密联系，群众是愿意投入的。要多层次、多渠道、多形式筹集开发资金。所谓多层次，就是包括中央、省、地、市、县一直到群众；所谓多渠道，就是各行各业，省内省外，国内国外，不仅要利用国内资金，而且要适当利用一部分外资；所谓多种形式，就是可以个人投入，可以联合投入，也可以同外省搞补偿贸易。五是，实行综合开发。要综合利用地区的自然资源，实行农林牧副渔全面发展，土水田林路综合治理，农工商一起上。开发，要重视农业，但决不是只发展农业，要重视粮食，但决不是只发展粮食生产。林业、水利以及相应的农产品加工也要摆到应有的位置上。农业发展基金里面，要有水利、林业一定的份额。对发展“菜篮子工程”，即发展副食品生产，也要给予一定的支持。六是，重视科技的投入。这是非常重要的。新的农业开发，不能只靠传统耕作方式去搞，一定要重视和推广运用先进农业耕作技术和科研成果。没有这一条，农业开发肯定是搞不好的，效益是提不高的。七是，要十分重视保护生态环境。农业开发是科学合理地利用自然资源，而决不能破坏自然资源。农业开发讲效益，其中就包括生态效益，事先一定要做好论证工作，对生态环境要有保护措施。
    第二，要实行正确的政策，鼓励、调动各级以及广大农民投入开发的积极性。开发三江平原的政策，开发黄淮海平原的政策，也都适用于其他地区的农业开发。凡是新开发的土地，新改造的中低产田，因此而增加的产品，在税收、价格等方面实行较为优惠的政策，并且国家在分配生产资料方面对开发地区给予照顾，同时国家每年将拨给一定数量的开发贷款和一定的扶持资金。哪些是要国家办的，哪些是群众自己可以办的，要很好研究。水利工程，大、中型的群众自己是办不了的，但是小水库，引水渠道，这些可以靠群众投入来办。道路建设、能源以及一些比较大的农产品加工设施，是需要国家扶持或投资兴办的。
    第三，要加强领导和指导，加强组织工作。各地搞农业开发，可以组织一个领导小组来抓这件事，领导小组下面设一个精干的办公室专门抓这项工作，但不要层层办成公司。办成公司，往往是什么赚钱干什么，容易忽视农业项目，而且搞公司又要花钱养一批人，还是把有限的资金集中用于开发农业为好。当然，搞项目承包的，可以办经济实体。要加强农业开发资金的管理工作。农业开发资金，要重点安排使用，把效益放在第一位，地方配套资金一定要保证，不能落空；要按项目定投入，然后归口管理；要建立健全规章制度，加强检查、监督，农业开发资金只能用于农业开发，不准挪作他用。
    第四，要有重点、有计划地逐步推进。我们可供开发的资源很多，但目前资金等各方面的力量有限，不能全面铺开，要把有限的资金优先用在潜力大、见效快、效益高的地方，先易后难、有计划地一片一片地开发。去年重点搞了三江平原、黄淮海地区等六七片的重点开发，今年也必须重点搞几片开发。
    这次会上提出了个初步意见，可以作进一步论证，争取尽快与有关省、区协商，制定具体规划，抓紧实施，使今年的农业开发取得更加可喜的进展。
