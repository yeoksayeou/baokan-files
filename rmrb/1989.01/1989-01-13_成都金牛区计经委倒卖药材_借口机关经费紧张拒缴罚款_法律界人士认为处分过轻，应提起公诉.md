The Chengdu Jinniu District Economic Commission invested 300,000 yuan in the illegal trading of tiger bones and leopard bones and was caught. Legal experts say, "This case could have been prosecuted for speculation and illegal operation of state-controlled medicinal materials." However, to this day, the Jinniu District Economic Commission has not paid the 20,000 yuan fine imposed by the Chengdu Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce.

In early June 1988, Jinniu District Economic Commission Director Zhang Xiuyuan and the manager of the Jinniu District Economic Information Service Company, which is affiliated with the District Light Industry Association, agreed to jointly operate the leopard bone business and share the profits. The Economic Commission transferred 300,000 yuan in three installments on June 8, 9, and 11 to the Information Company, which then used the funds to purchase 48.9 kilograms of tiger bones and 177.4 kilograms of leopard bones. On June 17, this illegal activity of trading state-controlled medicinal materials was discovered by the municipal industry and commerce and public security departments. Subsequently, the tiger bones, leopard bones, and illegal income were confiscated, and the director of the District Economic Commission, Zhang Xiuyuan, received an administrative warning.

According to the investigation, before the Economic Commission joined in the illegal trading, the Jinniu District Information Company was already engaged in similar illegal operations. From January to June 1988 alone, the company had already traded 892.5 kilograms of tiger bones, 1,299.3 kilograms of leopard bones, 34 kilograms of antelope horns, and 301.5 kilograms of poppy husks, earning 270,000 yuan.

According to experts, approximately 890 kilograms of tiger bones are equivalent to the remains of 50 tigers, which may include bones from the endangered South China tiger. The portion of the illegal trade involving the Jinniu District Economic Commission alone accounts for at least three tiger skeletons.

The Jinniu District Economic Commission, which participated in the illegal trading of state-controlled medicinal materials, replied in a letter to the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce on November 19 last year, citing budget constraints and stating that the government agency could not afford to pay the fine.

### 成都金牛区计经委倒卖药材  借口机关经费紧张拒缴罚款  法律界人士认为处分过轻，应提起公诉

　　成都金牛区计经委倒卖药材
    借口机关经费紧张拒缴罚款
    法律界人士认为处分过轻，应提起公诉
    新华社成都１月１２日电  （记者贺晓林）成都市金牛区计经委出资３０万元参与非法倒卖虎骨、豹骨被查获。法律界人士说：“此案本来可以投机倒把罪、非法经营国家管制药材罪提起公诉”。但时至今日，金牛区计经委却连市工商局规定的２万元罚款也没缴纳。
    １９８８年６月初，金牛区计经委主任曾修元同本区二轻联社所属的金牛区经济信息服务公司经理邹庆友达成联合经营豹骨、盈利分成的协议，计经委于６月８日、９日、１１日分三次拨款共３０万元给信息公司，信息公司即用此款收购虎骨４８．９公斤、豹骨１７７．４公斤，６月１７日，这起倒卖国家管制药材的非法活动被市工商、公安部门查获。此后，虎骨、豹骨及非法收入被没收，区计经委主任曾修元受行政警告处分。
    据调查，金牛区信息公司在区计经委入伙倒卖之前，就在进行相同的非法经营。仅１９８８年１月到６月，这个公司就已倒卖虎骨８９２．５公斤，豹骨１２９９．３公斤，羚羊角３４公斤，罂粟壳３０１．５公斤，获２７万元。
    据行家判断，８９０多公斤虎骨约相当于５０只老虎的骨骸，其中不排除有濒临灭绝的华南虎骨。而金牛区计经委参与倒卖部分，起码有３只虎的骨架。
    参与倒卖国家管制药材的金牛区计经委，在接到市工商局罚款２万元的处理决定后，去年１１月１９日以公文形式致函工商局说，政府机关经费紧张，无钱交罚款。
