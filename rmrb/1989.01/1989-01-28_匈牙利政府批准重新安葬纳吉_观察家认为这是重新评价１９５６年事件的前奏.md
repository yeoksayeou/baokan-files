The Hungarian government has approved the reburial of Nagy Imre, the former prime minister who was executed 30 years ago, along with his co-defendants.

This was announced today by the Hungarian government spokesman, Marossán, at a press conference. The Hungarian government held a meeting today to discuss this issue.

Nagy Imre served as the prime minister of the Hungarian government from October 24 to November 4, 1956, during the Hungarian events of that year. At that time, after the Soviet Union sent troops to Hungary, he announced on behalf of the government that Hungary would withdraw from the Warsaw Pact. After the Hungarian events were suppressed, he was executed on June 16, 1958, for counter-revolutionary crimes. Among the 10 defendants in the same case, those who were also executed included Defense Minister Pál Maléter, Nagy's secretary József Szilágyi, State Minister Géza Losonczy, and journalist Miklós Gimes. They were all buried in unmarked graves after their deaths.

Marossán said that, at the request of the families of the deceased, Nagy Imre and the other four co-defendants who were executed can be reburied in the Kozma Street Cemetery in Budapest. So far, the work of identifying the remains of the deceased has been basically completed with the participation of government experts and experts hired by the families. The time of reburial and whether a public memorial service will be held are to be decided by the families of the deceased.

Marossán pointed out that the government's decision to meet the families' request is for the purpose of "humanitarianism" and "promoting social stability."

Recently, in the process of expanding political democracy and implementing political pluralism in Hungary, many people have called for a re-evaluation of the 1956 events and Nagy Imre. Imre Pozsgay, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and State Secretary, also proposed in a speech on the 25th that clarifying the 1956 events is an "urgent task." Observers here believe that the government's approval of the reburial of Nagy Imre and others is a prelude to re-evaluating the 1956 events.

　　匈牙利政府批准重新安葬纳吉    
    观察家认为这是重新评价１９５６年事件的前奏
    新华社布达佩斯１月２６日电（记者侯凤菁）３０年前被处死的匈牙利前政府总理纳吉·伊姆雷及其同案人即将被重新安葬。
    这是匈牙利政府发言人马罗山今天在新闻发布会上宣布的。匈牙利政府今天开会讨论了这个问题。
    纳吉·伊姆雷在１９５６年匈牙利事件发生后，曾于同年１０月２４日至１１月４日任政府总理。当时在苏联向匈牙利出兵后，他代表政府宣布匈牙利退出华沙条约。匈牙利事件平息后，他于１９５８年６月１６日因反革命罪被处死。在同案的１０名被告中被处死的还有国防部长毛莱泰尔·帕尔、纳吉的秘书长西拉吉·约瑟夫、国务部长洛松齐·盖佐和新闻记者吉迈什·米克洛什。他们死后都被埋在无名墓中。
    马罗山说，根据死者家属的共同要求，被处死的纳吉·伊姆雷及其另外４名同案人可以在布达佩斯的科兹毛胡同公墓重新安葬。迄今，在政府的专家和家属聘请的专家的参与下，辨认死者遗骨的工作已基本完成。重新安葬的时间和是否举行公祭均由死者家属自己决定。
    马罗山指出，政府满足死者家属要求的目的，是为“实行人道”和“促进社会安定”。
    最近在匈牙利扩大政治民主和实行政治多元化的过程中，许多人要求对１９５６年事件和纳吉·伊姆雷重新进行评价。匈牙利社会主义工人党中央政治局委员、政府国务部长波日高伊·伊姆雷在２５日的一次讲话中也提出，对１９５６年事件进行澄清是“当务之急”。此间观察家认为，政府准许重新安葬纳吉·伊姆雷等人是重新评价１９５６年事件的前奏。
