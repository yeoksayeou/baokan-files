	Nan Kang Recalls Funds for Car Purchase to Invest in Water Conservancy

	Nan Kang Town, located along the coast of Guangxi's Hepu County, has long hoped for a small car. However, just as the car was within reach, Nan Kang Town suddenly decided to use the funds meant for the car to invest in water conservancy. This story has been praised by local farmers.

	Eight months ago, the Nan Kang Town government sent 35,000 yuan, accumulated over many years, to Nanning City to purchase a small car through a certain unit. Recently, the entrusted unit informed them that the ordered car would soon arrive and asked them to prepare to pick it up.

	At this moment, the Nan Kang Town Party and government leaders read the State Council's decision on increasing agricultural investment to achieve a bumper harvest in 1989. Nan Kang Town then decided to recall the car purchase funds and borrow an additional 50,000 yuan from town-level units to support farmers in repairing severely damaged water conservancy facilities.

	The news spread quickly, inspiring all sectors of society. Farmers said, "The town government has given us the money meant for buying a car to repair water conservancy facilities. We should also do our part."

	Soon, farmers across the town sold pigs, sold economic crops, and even withdrew savings intended for building new houses or weddings. They all contributed to the repair of water conservancy facilities. In just a few days, the town raised over 100,000 yuan for water conservancy.

　　南康追回买小汽车款投资水利
    本报南宁电  地处沿海的广西合浦县南康镇盼着有一辆小汽车已经很久了，可是，当小汽车就要唾手可得时，南康镇忽然把买车钱变成了水利投资。这件事被当地农民传为佳话。
    八个月前，南康镇政府把积聚多年的三点五万元钱汇到南宁市，委托某单位协助购买一辆小汽车。最近，受托单位来信说，订购的小汽车即到，请准备派人提货。
    就在这时，南康镇党政领导看到了国务院关于增加农业投入，夺取一九八九年农业丰收的决定。南康镇随之做出决定：派人追回小汽车款，同时向镇直单位借款五万元，用于支持农民维修失修严重的水利设施。
    消息迅速传开，感染了社会各界。农民群众说，镇政府把买小汽车的钱都让给我们修水利，我们也要跟着干。
    很快，全镇农民有的卖生猪，有的售经济作物，有的把准备建新房办婚事的存款也取出来，集中用在兴修水利上。几天时间，全镇就筹集水利资金十万多元。
