Iraq is preparing to resume peace talks with Iran. Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz said on the 28th in Baghdad that Iraq is ready to resume peace talks with Iran at a date deemed appropriate by the United Nations Secretary-General.

Aziz made the remarks during a meeting with the UN Secretary-General's special envoy, Jan Eliasson.

Aziz called on Iran to stop its propaganda campaign to create an atmosphere of mutual trust for the resumption of talks, so that both sides can seriously implement UN Security Council Resolution 598.
