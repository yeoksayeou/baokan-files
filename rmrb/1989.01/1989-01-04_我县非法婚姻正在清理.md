The county is currently in the process of clearing up illegal marriages. On September 17, 1988, the fifth edition of your newspaper published a reader's letter titled "Pay Attention to the Problem of Teenage Elopements." The county's leading organs have paid great attention to this issue and have organized a special task force to begin cleaning up illegal marriages throughout the county. A pilot program has already been initiated in one township, where 52 cases of illegal marriages have been cleared up.
