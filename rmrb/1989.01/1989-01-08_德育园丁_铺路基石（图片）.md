Four years ago, to alleviate the shortage of physical education teachers in primary schools, Wu Zihong, the principal of Beijing No. 40 Middle School, established a vocational high school for physical education in Xicheng District, Beijing. The school enrolled 120 students in its first year. Over the course of three years, some students joined the military, found jobs, were promoted, or went into business. By graduation, only 60 remained. Here are the stories of some of the steadfast individuals:

	Tab	Tab	Tab	Tab	Left Bottom One: His name is Yuan Yuan, 19 years old. After taking up his post, he declared: "Within two years, I will turn around the physical education performance of Daxiangfeng Primary School."

	Tab	Tab	Tab	Tab	Left Bottom Two: "I studied gymnastics, and I get anxious when I hear that China lacks gymnastics talent. The poor development of gymnastics in primary schools is due to a lack of teachers." Cui Yanyu went to teach at Shiyan No. 2 Primary School, and the school's evaluation was "satisfactory."

	Tab	Tab	Tab	Tab	Left Bottom Three: Cai Qun, standing at 1.80 meters tall, confidently arrived at Fuxing Road Primary School to teach physical education. "I love basketball and want to pass on my ball skills to the children."

	Tab	Tab	Tab	Tab	Left Bottom Four: He Mingyu, a former amateur sports school student, is currently teaching physical education at Zhonghua Road No. 1 Primary School, and he is doing a great job.

	Tab	Tab	Tab	Tab	Right: Fuyou Street Primary School evaluated the 20-year-old Yang Tong as follows: "Her arrival as a physical education teacher is like sending coal in the snow. We no longer have to worry about the 16 physical education classes per week, morning exercises, or track and field team training."

    德育园丁  铺路基石
    4年前，为了缓解小学体育教师短缺的状况，北京四十中校长吴梓洪在北京市西城区创办了一所体育职业高中，当年招生120名，3年中，参军、招工、提干、从商……毕业时仅剩60人，请看其中坚定分子的表现：
    下左一：他叫袁园，19岁，上任后他表示：两年内让大翔凤小学体育成绩翻个身。
    下左二：“我是学体操的，一说我国体操后备人才不足就着急。小学体操开展得不好，就是缺老师。”崔延玉到实验二小任教，学校的评语是“满意”。
    下左三：蔡群，1米80的个子，信心十足地来到复兴路小学教体育。“我爱篮球，想把学到的球技传给孩子们。”
    下左四：曾是业余体校学员的何明宇正在展览路一小给学生上体育课，干得挺带劲。
    右：府右街小学对20岁的杨彤这样评价：“她来当体育老师真是为我们雪里送炭，每周16节体育课，课间操、田径队训练都不愁了。”
