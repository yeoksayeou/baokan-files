Austria has begun the second phase of its comprehensive tax reform to align with the European Community's internal market. Austrian Finance Minister Lauritz announced on January 2 that the next step will be to reduce the value-added tax (VAT) rates to match those of the European Community.

Currently, Austria's VAT rates for goods and services are 10%, 20%, and 30%, which are significantly higher than those in the European Community. To facilitate Austria's entry into the European Community's internal market by 1992, the government has started to coordinate its tax system accordingly.

Lauritz emphasized that the reduction in VAT rates must not affect the current fiscal austerity policy of the coalition government. The reduction will initially focus on the VAT for consumer goods.

Additionally, a new tax reform regulation that took effect on January 1 this year aims to reduce the income tax burden for families with multiple children and low incomes. For example, families with three children and a monthly income of less than 12,100 schillings will receive tax benefits on their 13th and 14th monthly salaries, paying only 942 schillings in taxes. Conversely, families with higher incomes and fewer children will have to pay more taxes on their 13th and 14th monthly salaries.

Lauritz concluded by stating that the government's fiscal austerity policy implemented in 1988 has achieved significant results.

### 为参加欧共体内部大市场作准备  奥地利全面实行税制改革

　　为参加欧共体内部大市场作准备
    奥地利全面实行税制改革
    新华社维也纳电  奥地利财政部长拉齐纳１月２日在这里宣布，奥地利全面改革税收制度的第二个步骤将是减少增值税率，使之与欧洲共同体的增值税率相协调。
    目前，奥地利对商品及劳务费用的现行增值税率分别为１０％、２０％和３０％，大大高于欧共体国家的商品增值税率。为了使奥地利能够加入１９９２年形成的欧共体内部市场，因此，政府从现在开始着手在税收制度上进行相应的协调工作。
    拉齐纳表示，减少增值税率的行动应以不影响联合政府现行的财政预算紧缩政策为前提。减少增值税将首先从消费商品的增值税入手。
    此外，于今年１月１日生效的税收改革新条例旨在减轻那些多子女、收入低的家庭在所得税上的负担。如父母月工资收入在１２１００先令以下、有三个孩子的家庭在每年第１３和１４个月工资税收上将得到国家的优惠，即只征收９４２先令。反之，父母月工资收入高，且孩子少的家庭将要在第１３和１４个月的工资税收上多上缴税款。
    拉齐纳最后说，１９８８年政府执行的紧缩财政预算政策取得显著成效。
