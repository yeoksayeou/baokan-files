As a disabled person, I have had joy like everyone else. However, societal prejudices and the chilling inequality have given me far more troubles than others.

I contracted polio at the age of one, resulting in paralysis of my lower limbs. Fortunately, my mind is sound, and my academic performance was always good. In the junior high school entrance examination of Chengguan District, I was awarded a second-class prize. However, since graduating from high school in 1984, due to my disability, I was not allowed to take the college entrance examination, and recruitment for jobs and cadres was also restricted. In 1984, the Agricultural Bank of China system was recruiting a batch of "business agents." As a jobless youth in the agricultural bank system, I wrote to the regional agricultural bank leaders requesting to participate in the examination. However, the relevant leaders rejected my request on the grounds of "unsuitable physical condition."

In 1985, the Agricultural Bank system again recruited high school graduates for positions. I immediately submitted an application. To my surprise, the application seemed to have vanished into thin air. I had no choice but to play the mouth organ, flute, and guitar to pass the time, or knit sweaters for others for free, sometimes venting my resentment towards those who treated me unfairly. I continued to write to various levels of agricultural bank leaders, expressing my desire for a job. In October 1986, I was temporarily assigned to the Han Yin County Branch of the Agricultural Bank of China in Shaanxi Province to do typing.

The Agricultural Bank has a lot of documents, papers, and forms, but there is only one typewriter, so the workload is enormous. I am not afraid of hard work and often work overtime until 10:30 PM to ensure that various materials are typed on time. What I find hard to understand is that as a temporary worker, my salary is pitifully low compared to the regular workers, and I do not receive any other benefits. I am also constantly worried about being fired for poor performance.

In November 1987, the Agricultural Bank system recruited again. I requested the regional bank president to allow me to participate in the examination, and he agreed. I was so happy that I couldn't sleep for several nights. However, when it came time for official registration, the president said I did not meet the physical conditions and refused to let me register. Last November, I heard that there would be recruitment among high school graduates, so I went to the county personnel bureau to register. When I joyfully received my admission ticket, the county personnel bureau suddenly issued a notice saying, "Unsuitable physical condition, cannot take the exam." I could only sigh, "When will we be able to treat disabled people equally here?"

　　残疾姑娘求平等
    尹娟
    作为残疾人，我和别人一样有过欢乐。但是，世俗的偏见，令人心寒的不平等，使我有比别人多得多的苦恼。
    我一岁多患了小儿麻痹症，导致下肢瘫痪。幸运的是，我的脑子很健全，上学时成绩总是比较好。在城关区的初中统考中，我荣获了２等奖。然而，自１９８４年高中毕业后，因我腿残，高考不让我参加，招工、招干也受限制。１９８４年，中国农业银行系统要内招一批“业务代办员”，我属农行系统待业青年，就向地区农行领导写信要求参加考试。可有关领导以“身体条件不行”为由，拒绝让我参加考试。
    １９８５年又逢农行系统面向社会高中毕业生招干，我立刻写了申请。谁知，那申请书竟如同石沉大海。我只好凭借口琴、笛子、吉它来解闷，或者义务为周围的人编织毛衣来消磨时间，有时也不免向不平等待我之人发泄怨恨。我还不停地给各级农行领导写信，倾诉我要求工作的心情。１９８６年１０月，我被临时安排在中国农业银行陕西省汉阴县支行打字。
    农行的文件、论文、表格特别多，打字机却只有一台，工作量之大是可想而知的。我不怕苦，经常加班到晚上１０点多钟，及时打出各种材料。叫我难以理解的是，我这个临时工与那些正式工相比，工资低得可怜，其它福利待遇也没有我的份，还终日担心干得不好被解雇。
    １９８７年１１月，农行系统再次招干。我向地区农行行长请求让我参加考试，行长同意了。我高兴得几晚没睡好。但是，到正式报名时，行长又说我身体不符条件，拒绝让我报名。去年１１月，听说要在高中毕业生中招干，我去县人事局报名。当我欣喜地拿到准考证时，县人事局突然来了个“身体不行，不能考试”的通知。我只好仰天长叹：“我们这里什么时候才能平等对待残疾人？”
