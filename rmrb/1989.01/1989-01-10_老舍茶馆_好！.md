The Old She Tea House – Great!
By Deng Youmei, Illustrated by Xia Qingquan

A tea house named after Lao She has opened near Qianmen Archway. A friend invited me to visit. As I sat down at a round table, picked up a covered cup, and heard the strings resonate, my heart warmed up! It felt like Beijing was truly Beijing again, and I was living among Beijing people again. Nowadays, Beijing residents under 30 have never seen a tea house. The term itself comes from Lao She's play.

To be honest, old Beijing tea houses were not just places for the wealthy to relax. Decades ago, if you went to tea houses near Hading Gate, Drum Tower, or outside Qianmen Gate, you would mostly see common people. Workers in certain industries (like rickshaw pullers) would go to tea houses to find work; antique dealers would go to tea houses; brokers would go to tea houses; friends would meet, and editors would arrange assignments, all in tea houses. Going to a tea house wasn't just to quench thirst; it was a place for exchanging information, discussing business, and socializing. In modern terms, it was a convenient place for public relations.

Of course, tea houses were also places of entertainment. In the old society, rickshaw pullers, porters, apprentices, and laborers, as long as they could earn enough to fill their stomachs for two meals a day and had a few spare coins, they also wanted some entertainment. Grand theaters and dance halls were beyond their reach, both in terms of money and taste. Entering a tea house, for a few cents, one could enjoy a pot of high-quality tea and listen to a story. This bit of enjoyment was affordable and worthwhile. You can't call this a bourgeois lifestyle!

There are listeners, naturally there must be performers, and nothing is more suitable for tea house performances than storytelling and folk arts. Tea houses thus became venues for artists to perform and practice. Look through the autobiographies or resumes of old folk artists, how many of them didn't first gain fame in tea houses? In my early years of hardship, after a day's labor, I would go to tea houses every night to listen to storytelling. Today, I can write a few lines of "Beijing-flavored novels," which indeed benefits greatly from my time in tea houses. Such a place for public activities and mass entertainment suddenly disappeared for decades. You might ask, what did the tea houses do wrong?

In recent years, following the trend of "modernizing," I had the opportunity to go abroad and actually sit in tea houses. The "Lu Yu Tea House" in Hong Kong, I go whenever I have the chance. Seeing Hong Kong movie stars and news figures also enjoying tea there, it's like ancient times meeting modern times. I've also been to tea houses in New York and Los Angeles, and they are just as bustling, not inferior to coffee shops. The small alley coffee shops are more authentic than the trendy coffee shops introduced to China, not only the coffee is authentic, but the atmosphere is authentic, and the songs sung are originals, yet there are still Chinese tea houses. I asked an American friend who works with computers, "You are a genuine foreigner, why don't you go drink coffee and come to drink tea?" He said, "I drink coffee, I also drink tea. These are two different kinds of enjoyment, not only the taste is different, but also the cultural atmosphere is different. Enjoying tea, listening to storytelling, experiencing a bit of Eastern charm, life isn't more colorful? After finishing, I can still go back to my computer, what's wrong with that? Sitting in a tea house doesn't hinder modernization."

At that time, I thought: While we are introducing excellent Western science and culture, we also introduced coffee shops and bars, which is great (though it's a bit expensive!). Foreign tea houses are from China, and business is good. Can't we do an export-turned-domestic-sale?

I shared this idea with friends, and they all laughed at me, saying, "Your ideas are like your novels, all from the past. Now people want to drink 'Coca-Cola,' 'Nestle Coffee,' dance to disco, and sing pop songs. Who goes to tea houses to listen to storytelling? Outdated, pitiful, tragic!"

Just when I was feeling desperate, unexpectedly, Eming Xingxi appeared! Eming Xingxi, with a few unemployed youths, sold big bowl tea, and in a few years, he made a fortune, now owning hundreds of millions of assets, becoming the general manager of the "Beijing Big Bowl Tea Trade Group Company," and was named a "Beijing Labor Model," receiving the "National May Day Labor Medal." If you talk about being trendy, he is quite trendy. He invested and opened this "Old She Tea House" near Qianmen Archway. For a few days, it was full of customers, and many old friends who hadn't seen each other for years met here. On the day I came, I happened to meet Sun Shuyun and Guan Xuezeng participating in a performance. These two are already old and have retired from the stage, why did they come to join the fun? Sun Shuyun said, "I have sung Beijing storytelling all my life and love this art. I am afraid it will disappear. At my age, who knows when I might leave. While I can still move, I want to do something to revive folk arts. The tea house opening provides a performance venue for folk arts, and I want to contribute to its development and prosperity." Guan Xuezeng said even more bluntly, "Recently, people often ask, is Guan Xuezeng still around? Of course, I am! How am I not around? You haven't heard me sing? I haven't sung in a few years, where can you listen to me? Retired, I can't go and cause trouble for others, but I still want to sing. Having this tea house is good, we can gather here, those who love to listen can listen, and those who love to sing can sing. This is also a joy!"

Perhaps someone will say: The lifestyle of going to tea houses is outdated and won't last long. Cucumbers and cabbages, each to their own. Some people love to go to coffee shops, and some people love to sit in tea houses. It's still that foreigner who spoke reasonably: "Sitting in a tea house doesn't hinder modernization."

As for whether it can last long, that's hard to say: Doing things seriously is not easy, and this tea house currently has many problems. Although Manager Eming can make money selling big bowl tea, selling small bowl tea will lose money. Fortunately, he understands that he is investing in culture, promoting spiritual civilization, and is prepared for losses. After all, with so many enthusiastic people helping and supporting it; the public—at least a part of the public—needs it, and it may not be without a future. Having a tea house in Beijing is good, the "Old She Tea House" is a good sign! Eming Xingxi, you truly have insight!

### 老舍茶馆——好！

　　老舍茶馆——好！
    邓友梅文　夏清泉图
    前门楼子跟前开了座“老舍茶馆”。朋友约我去坐。往八仙桌旁一坐，盖碗一端，耳边丝弦一响，心里就腾的一热！觉着北京城又像北京城了，我又生活在北京人中间了。如今３０岁以下的北京人都没见过茶馆。这词儿都是从老舍先生那出戏里听来的。
    实打实地说，老北京的茶馆并不是专供财主们消闲的地方。倒退几十年，上哈德门、鼓楼、前门外的茶馆看看，倒还是平民百姓居多。有的行业（比如拉排子车）工人找活干，上茶馆；夹包卖古玩的，上茶馆；说合拉房纤的，上茶馆；朋友聚会，编辑约稿，也上茶馆。上茶馆不光为了解渴，那是个交流信息、洽谈生意、约朋会友的交际活动场所。说句新词儿，是搞公共关系的方便所在。
    茶馆当然也是娱乐场。在旧社会，拉车的、赶脚的，大徒弟、小力笨，只要一天能混饱两顿窝窝头，腰里有俩闲钱，也想找点乐子。大剧院、跳舞场跟他们钱袋和喜好都没缘份。走进茶馆，一毛钱泡壶高末，二分钱听个段子。这点享受费用还花得起，也花得值。不能管这叫资产阶级生活方式！
    有听的，自然要有唱的，而适合茶馆演出的莫过于曲艺评书，茶馆就又成了艺人献艺和练艺的场地。翻翻曲艺老艺人的自传或简历，有几个不是从茶馆里先唱出名的？我走“背字”的头几年，白天劳动完了，夜夜去茶馆听评书。今天能写两句“京味小说”，实在是从茶馆得益匪浅。就这么个群众活动的去处、大众娱乐之场所，说声绝迹，居然就消失了几十年。您说茶馆得罪谁了？
    近两年跟着人“办洋务”，有机会走出国门，反倒能坐坐茶馆了。香港的“陆羽茶楼”，我有机会就去。看到香港的电影明星、新闻名人也常在那儿品茗谈事，也算古为今用。纽约、洛杉矶的茶馆我也去过，倒也座无虚席，并不比咖啡厅买卖差。小胡同里的咖啡厅也比中国新引进的时髦咖啡厅地道，不光咖啡地道，排场地道，唱的流行歌也是原装货，可那儿照样有中国茶馆。我问一个弄电脑的美国朋友：“您是地道的洋人，怎么不去喝咖啡要来喝茶？”他说：“我喝咖啡，也喝茶。这是两种不同的享受，不光味道两样，而且是两种不同的文化气氛。品品茶，听听评弹，领略一下东方情趣，生活不更多彩吗？喝完了仍然去摆弄我的电脑，有何不好？坐茶馆不碍现代化。”
    当时我就想：我们在引进西方优秀的科学文化的同时也引进了咖啡厅和酒吧，这当然挺好（就是贵点！）。外国的茶馆是从中国传去的，生意不错。咱能不能来个出口转内销呢？
    我把这想法对朋友说，人家都笑我，说是“你这套想法跟你的小说一样，全是翻过去的一页了。现在人们要喝‘可口可乐’、‘雀巢咖啡’，跳霹雳舞，唱流行歌。谁进茶馆听大鼓书啊？落后，可怜，可悲！”
    正当绝望之时，想不到凭空跳出个尹盛喜来！尹盛喜带着几个待业青年卖大碗茶，几年间发了大财，如今握有千百万的资财，成了“北京大碗茶商贸集团公司”总经理，当上了“北京市劳动模范”，荣获“全国五一劳动奖章”。要说新潮，也够新潮了。他竟投资把这个“老舍茶馆”在前门箭楼旁边开起来了。开张几天，座无虚席，许多几年不见的老朋友都在这儿见面了。我来的这天，正碰上孙书筠和关学增来参加演唱。这两位都年岁已高、息影舞台了，怎么也来凑这个热闹？孙书筠说：“我唱了一辈子京韵大鼓，爱上了这门艺术，我怕它绝了。我这个年纪，说不定哪天就走了。趁着能活动，多为振兴曲艺作点实事。茶馆开张为曲艺提供了个演出场地，咱出点力帮它发展兴旺起来。”关学增说得更绝：“近来常有人打听，关学增这人还有没有？我怎么没有哇？这不好好的吗？有，怎么没听见他唱？我这几年没唱，你上那儿听去？退休了，我不能去给人家添乱，可我还想唱。有这个茶馆就好了，没事咱们就来聚聚，爱听的听，爱唱的唱。这也是一乐！”
    也许有人说：坐茶馆的这套生活方式已经过时了，维持不久。黄瓜白菜，各有所爱。有人爱去咖啡厅，就有人爱坐茶馆。还是那位洋人说得在理：“坐茶馆不碍现代化。”
    至于能否维持长久，这就难说了：认真办点事很不易，这茶馆目前也还有不少难题。别看尹经理卖大碗茶能挣钱，卖小碗茶可要赔本。好在他明白这是在做文化投资，搞精神文明建设，有了赔钱的准备。话说回来，有这么多热心人帮助它，支持它；群众——就算是一部分群众吧，需要它，也未见得就没有前程。北京还是有个茶馆好，“老舍茶馆”是个好兆头！尹盛喜，您真有见识！
