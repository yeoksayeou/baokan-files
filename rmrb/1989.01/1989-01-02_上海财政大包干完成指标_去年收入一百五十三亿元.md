Shanghai's fiscal revenue reached 15.3 billion yuan this year, and the contracted amount to be handed over to the state has also been completed.

This year was the first year Shanghai implemented the fiscal contracting system. Shanghai comprehensively promoted the enterprise contract responsibility system and simultaneously implemented the fiscal contracting system for districts and counties.

Shanghai's broad masses of workers overcame a series of difficulties, including the spread of hepatitis A, a once-in-a-century heatwave, as well as shortages of raw materials, price increases, and increased subsidies for losses, in completing this year's fiscal revenue target. Nearly 9,000 financial and tax officials across the city contributed their ideas and helped enterprises resolve difficulties, while strengthening the collection work from large tax-paying enterprises with billions of yuan in profits to individual industrial and commercial households. This year, the city collected 12.5 billion yuan in industrial and commercial taxes, and the taxes paid by the individual economy also reached 260 million yuan, an increase of 25% over last year.

    去年收入一百五十三亿元
    新华社上海１９８８年１２月３１日电  （通讯员陈苏宁、记者何子葭）上海市今年财政收入达１５３亿元，上交国家的承包指标也已完成。
    今年是上海实行财政大包干的第一年。上海全面推行了企业承包经营责任制，同时实行了区、县财政包干。
    上海广大职工在完成今年财政收入任务中，克服了甲肝蔓延、百年罕见热浪以及原材料紧缺、价格上涨、亏损补贴增加等一连串困难。全市近９０００名财税干部，为制止财政收入滑坡纷纷献计献策，帮助企业排忧解难，同时对从上亿元税利大户到个体工商户都加强了征收工作。今年全市征收的工商税达到１２５亿元，个体经济缴纳的税款也达到了２．６亿元，比去年增长２５％。
