On the afternoon of October 12, 1988, we witnessed in the Qinghe Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital in Beijing's Haidian District that some doctors were prescribing medications to each other, and some were even writing prescriptions for acquaintances. Upon closer inspection, we found that some "patients" were not receiving medications but rather items such as Hua Zhi shampoo, razors, and soap. One "patient" even shouted, "I need 20 bars of soap." The doctor then wrote a prescription for "therapy ×× times, fee 50 yuan." After further investigation, we discovered that this hospital used the amount of fees collected by doctors as a standard for awarding bonuses and evaluating performance. As long as the patients were covered by public medical insurance, the doctors would write large prescriptions. Some doctors even exploited loopholes in the public medical insurance system to write prescriptions for acquaintances to purchase daily necessities.

This practice of arbitrarily writing prescriptions and favoring acquaintances, if allowed to continue, will not only result in a significant waste of medications and increase the cost of public medical insurance but also encourage improper practices.

Starting from September 9, 1988, Qinghe Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital assigned a pharmacist to set up a self-pay medication window. At that time, the hospital regulations stipulated that self-pay medications could be sold without a prescription, and a receipt could be issued with a "self-pay" stamp. From October 15 to 25, the pharmacist successively purchased flower pollen honey, gift honey, Changbai Mountain honey, Western ginseng royal jelly, Beijing royal jelly, shampoo, hair conditioner, and gold-plated lipstick, totaling over 11,000 yuan, with a sales profit of 4,000 yuan.

These items were sold without a prescription and were decided by the pharmacist and a dentist from the oral department without the hospital director's approval to be issued as outpatient fee receipts under the name of medication fees, without the "self-pay" stamp.

After repeated investigations, the bureau director criticized Qinghe Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital and made the following decisions: confiscate all illegal earnings; the hospital director should make a deep self-criticism to all staff; approve the hospital director's punishment of deducting half a year's bonus and three months' bonus from the two involved individuals; rectify Qinghe Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital; and criticize by name at the system-wide leadership meeting.

### 名为理疗实发香皂

　　名为理疗实发香皂
    １９８８年１０月１２日下午，我们在北京海淀区清河中医院看到，一些医生正在互相开处方，有的还给熟人开处方。上前仔细一打听，有些“患者”拿走的不是药，而是华姿洗发水、刮脸刀、香皂之类。有个“病人”还高喊：“我要２０块香皂。”于是，医生大笔一挥，处方上变成了“理疗××次，收费５０元”。经过一番了解，我们才知道，原来这家医院把医生的收费多少作为给医生发放奖金和评定工作的标准。病人只要是公费医疗，医生们就开大处方。有的医生还钻了公费医疗的空子，开处方，让熟人购走日用品。
    这种乱开处方、人情方的做法长此下去，不但会造成大量的药品浪费，增加了公费医疗的费用，而且助长了不正之风。                　　二位目击者
    　　　　·答复·
    清河中医院从１９８８年９月９日起，指派一名药剂人员设立自费药品窗口。当时医院规定自费药品出售时不开处方，可以开收据，加盖“自费”章。从１０月１５日到２５日，那位药剂人员先后购进花粉蜜、礼品蜂蜜、长白山蜂蜜、西洋参蜂皇浆、北京蜂王浆和洗发水、洗发香波、镀金口红等，总计１．１万多元，销售盈利４０００元。
    这些东西销售时没有处方，是那位药剂人员和口腔科一名医生未请示院长，私自决定以药费名义全部开了门诊收费收据，没有加盖自费章。
    经反复调查，我局局长对清河中医院给予了批评，并作出如下决定：没收全部非法所得；院长向全院职工做深刻检查；同意院长对两名当事人分别扣发半年奖金和３个月奖金的处罚；整顿清河中医院，并在全系统领导干部会上点名批评。
