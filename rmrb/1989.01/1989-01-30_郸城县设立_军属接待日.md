　　郸城县设立“军属接待日”
    据新华社郑州１月２９日电（通讯员岳献甫、记者蒋永武）“咱有啥事，能够同县长、书记谈；咱有啥难，有县长、书记帮咱解决。真看出‘军属光荣’来了！”在河南省郸城县的一个“军属接待日”，刚与县长交谈完的几位军属，兴奋地对记者表露了他们的光荣感和自豪感。
    郸城县县、乡两级“军属接待日”制度，是１９８８年８月开始设立的。每逢星期六，由县委书记、县长和乡党委书记、乡长出面，在２１个点上挂牌接待来访的军属。对军属的要求能立即解决的当场拍板；暂时解决不了的记录在案，抓紧落实。截至目前，已接待军属７８０人次，解决侵害军属权益的事件５起，帮助军属解决生产、生活等实际困难２４０多个。
