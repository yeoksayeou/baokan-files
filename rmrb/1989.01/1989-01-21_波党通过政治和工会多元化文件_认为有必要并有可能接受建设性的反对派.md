The Polish United Workers' Party has adopted an important document stating that it is prepared to engage in dialogue with any constructive political forces and explore forms of mutual understanding. It also mentioned that, under conditions of national understanding, restrictions on the establishment of new trade unions would be lifted.

This stance of the Polish United Workers' Party Central Committee was mentioned in an official document released this afternoon at the Warsaw Press Center. The document, titled "The Stand of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party on the Issues of Political and Trade Union Pluralism," was passed by a majority vote after heated debates during the second phase of the recently concluded 10th Plenary Session.

The document emphasizes the necessity of political pluralism in Poland, stating that political pluralism is an important component of Poland's socio-political reality. Given this fact, the Central Committee believes that political pluralism will be beneficial for the consolidation of a democratic and legal socialist state.

The document states that it is necessary and possible to include a constructive opposition within the political system. It points out that the forms of activity for a constructive opposition should be associations, political clubs, and socio-political thought centers.

Regarding the issue of trade union pluralism, the document states that new trade unions must comply with the constitution, various laws, and union statutes; engage in activities that are conducive to economic development; accept financial assistance in accordance with Polish laws and loyalty to the Polish state; and not disrupt social stability and national stability in their actions.

　　波党通过政治和工会多元化文件     
    认为有必要并有可能接受建设性的反对派
    新华社华沙１月１９日电  今天凌晨刚刚闭幕的波兰统一工人党十中全会通过的一项重要文件中说，波兰统一工人党“准备同任何建设性政治力量进行对话，并探讨达成谅解的形式”；“在民族谅解情况下，取消对成立新工会的限制”。
    波兰统一工人党中央的这一立场是今天下午在华沙记者中心散发的波党中央的一个正式文件中提到的。这个题为《波兰统一工人党中央委员会关于政治多元化和工会多元化问题的立场》的文件，是刚刚结束的十中全会第二阶段会议经过激烈争论后以多数票通过的。
    文件强调在波兰实行政治多元化的必要性，认为政治多元化“是波兰社会—政治现实的重要组成部分”。鉴于这一事实，波党中央认为，实行政治多元化“将有利于民主和法治的社会主义国家的巩固”。
    文件说，波党中央认为把建设性反对派列入政治制度范围内“是必要的和可能的”。文件指出，建设性反对派的活动形式“应是协会、政治俱乐部和社会政治思想中心”。
    关于工会多元化问题，文件指出，新工会必须遵守宪法、各项法律和工会章程；进行有利于发展经济的活动；按照波兰法律和忠于波兰国家的原则接受财政资助以及在行动上不破坏社会安定和国家稳定。
