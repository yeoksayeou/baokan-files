The year 1989 has arrived!

The year 1988 that has just passed is unforgettable. In this year, we continued to advance along the path opened by the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, achieving new successes in the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. In this year, we continued to steadfastly implement the general policy and guidelines of reform and opening up, making new explorations and accumulating new experiences in economic system reform, political system reform, and opening up to the outside world. In this year, we also encountered unprecedented serious problems. The most prominent of these were the obvious inflation and excessive price increases in economic life, as well as some negative and corrupt phenomena in party and government organs and society that were shocking to see. In the autumn of this year, in response to the new problems encountered in our progress, our Party held the Third Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, determining the guiding principles of rectifying the economic environment, rectifying the economic order, and deepening the reform comprehensively. The ship of China is sailing forward towards its set goals, facing the winds and waves!

Regarding the serious difficulties and problems encountered in the tenth year of reform, the vast majority of people, both within and outside the Party, lacked sufficient mental preparation, and there was much discussion. This is very natural. Regardless of what differences of opinion people have, regardless of what complaints they have, there is one consensus: to achieve the Four Modernizations and revitalize China, there is only the path of reform. Retreating back to the old, closed, and rigid shell would only make the Chinese nation return to poverty and weakness, making it difficult to revitalize. The solution to the difficulties encountered in the reform is not to retreat in the face of difficulties or to give up halfway, but to seriously summarize experiences, take effective coordinated measures, and continue to deepen the reform.

If asked, what was the greatest achievement of the past year? It can be said that it was that the entire Party and the people of the whole country had a deeper understanding that, after the "energy" released at the beginning of the reform played a significant role in promoting progress, to make the reform enter a deeper level and achieve the goal of establishing the dominant position of the new system, a series of extremely complex problems need to be solved. Reform is indeed a very complex and arduous revolution. There is no ideal plan, and it is impossible to be smooth sailing or to succeed with just one reform. There is no ready-made model for us to follow, and there is no ready-made plan for us to implement. We can only rely on ourselves to explore forward along the path of practice, cognition, and then practice and cognition again. Therefore, in a sense, difficulties are the classroom, and problems are the teachers. Temporary setbacks can make us learn many things that we cannot learn in good times. What is most needed now is to seriously summarize experiences, improve our understanding of the laws of reform, and thus strengthen our confidence in reform, unite closely around the Party Central Committee, work together in unity and with shared purpose, and strive with hard work.

History will not be severed. 1989 is a continuation of 1988. Both positive and negative, active and passive, joyful and heavy things will inevitably continue. "The first day of the year marks the beginning of a new cycle, and all things are renewed," is after all just a good wish. We must, through united struggle, develop positive, active, and joyful things, making their proportion increasingly larger; overcome negative, passive, and heavy things, making their proportion gradually smaller. 1989 will definitely surpass 1988.

In the new year, we must more resolutely implement the principles of the Third Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, take more effective measures in rectifying the economic environment and rectifying the economic order, and achieve more obvious results.

In the new year, we must push forward the economic system reform in a solid manner, combining rectification and adjustment of the industrial structure with deepening the reform, combining current benefits with long-term considerations, and strive unremittingly to establish a new order for socialist commodity economy.

In the new year, we must vigorously develop agriculture, especially grain production, increase the effective supply of agricultural and sideline products, and strive to break the stalemate of grain production that has persisted for several years, aiming for a bumper harvest in agriculture.

In the new year, we must actively and steadily push forward the political system reform, strengthen socialist democracy and socialist legal system construction, resolutely maintain a stable and united political situation, to ensure and promote the smooth progress of economic system reform and the Four Modernizations.

In the new year, we must further strengthen the Party and government discipline, especially in the area of clean governance, take more practical and effective measures to limit negative and corrupt phenomena to the smallest extent possible, and strive to maintain and enhance the prestige of the Party and government, strengthen the cohesion and appeal of the Party and government, to create a better and healthier political environment for the smooth progress of reform and opening up, and promote the spiritual civilization construction of the whole society.

In the new year, we must further push forward the reform of the science and technology system and the education system, better mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses of scientific and technological personnel and educational workers, and promote the development of science and technology and education.

The tasks facing us in 1989 are enormous and arduous. The conditions for completing these tasks are also in place. From the international perspective, the world is shifting from confrontation to dialogue, from tension to relaxation. This change is generally favorable to our country. Our country has the opportunity to secure a long-term stable international environment, to concentrate on reform and the Four Modernizations. The key is for us to seize this favorable condition, overcome various unfavorable factors, do our own work well, and not miss the opportunity for development.

1989 will be the 40th anniversary of the founding of our People's Republic. Let us, with more diligent and solid work, with new achievements in reform and construction, welcome the arrival of this glorious festival.

　　同心同德　艰苦奋斗
    ——一九八九年元旦献词
    １９８９年来到了！
    刚刚过去的１９８８年是难忘的。在这一年，我们继续沿着中国共产党十一届三中全会开辟的道路前进，在建设有中国特色的社会主义的伟大事业中取得了新的成就。在这一年，我们继续坚定不移地贯彻执行改革开放的总方针和总政策，在经济体制改革、政治体制改革和对外开放中进行了新的探索，积累了新的经验。在这一年，我们也遇到了前所未遇的严重问题，最突出的就是经济生活中明显的通货膨胀、物价上涨幅度过大，党政机关和社会上的某些消极腐败现象也使人触目惊心。这一年的秋天，针对前进中遇到的新问题，我们党召开了十三届三中全会，确定了治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序、全面深化改革的指导方针。中国的航船正迎着风浪，向着既定的目标前进！
    对于在改革的第十年遇到的严重困难和问题，上上下下、党内党外绝大多数人缺乏足够的思想准备，一时间议论纷纷，这是很自然的。不管人们有什么样的歧见，有什么样的牢骚，有一点则是共识：要实现四化、振兴中华，唯有改革一途。倒退回去，重新回到封闭僵化的旧躯壳中，只能使中华民族重归贫弱，难以振兴。解决改革中遇到的难题，答案决不是知难而退、半途而废，而是认真总结经验，采取有力的配套措施，继续深化改革。
    如果问，过去一年中最大的收获是什么？可以说，那就是全党同志、全国人民更深切地认识到，在改革初始释放出来的“能量”起到明显的推动作用之后，要使改革进入更深的层次，达到确立新体制主导地位的目的，需要解决一系列极其错综复杂的问题。改革的确是一场非常复杂、非常艰巨的革命，理想化的方案是没有的，不可能一帆风顺，不可能一改就灵。在我们面前，既没有现成的模式可搬，也没有现成的方案可循，只能靠我们自己循着实践、认识、再实践、再认识的道路探索前进。因此，从某种意义上说，困难就是课堂，问题就是老师。暂时的曲折能够使我们学到很多在顺境中学不到的东西。当前最需要的是，认真总结经验，提高对改革的规律性的认识，从而坚定改革的信心，紧紧团结在党中央的周围，同心同德，振奋精神，艰苦奋斗。
    历史不会割断。１９８９年是１９８８年的继续，正面的、反面的，积极的、消极的，欢快的、沉重的东西，都不可避免地会继续。“一元复始，万象更新”，毕竟只是良好的祝愿。我们要通过团结一致的奋斗，发展正面的、积极的、欢快的东西，使它们的比重越来越大；克服反面的、消极的、沉重的东西，使它们的比重逐渐降低。１９８９年一定会胜过１９８８年。
    在新的一年里，我们一定要更加坚决地贯彻党的十三届三中全会的方针，在治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序中采取更有力的措施，取得更明显的成效。
    在新的一年里，我们一定要扎扎实实地把经济体制改革推向前进，把治理、整顿同调整产业结构、深化改革结合起来，把当前的效益同长远的考虑结合起来，为建立社会主义商品经济的新秩序而不懈地努力。
    在新的一年里，我们一定要大力发展农业特别是粮食生产，增加农副产品的有效供给，努力打破持续几年的粮食生产徘徊不前的局面，争取农业丰收。
    在新的一年里，我们一定要积极稳妥地推进政治体制改革，加强社会主义民主和社会主义法制建设，坚决维护安定团结的政治局面，以保证和推动经济体制改革和四化建设的顺利进行。
    在新的一年里，我们一定要进一步从严治党、从严治政，特别是在廉政方面采取更切实有力的措施，把消极腐败现象限制在最小的范围之内，努力维护和提高党和政府的威信，增强党和政府的凝聚力、号召力，为改革开放的顺利进行创造更为良好、更为健康的政治环境，并推动整个社会的精神文明建设。
    在新的一年里，我们一定要进一步推进科技体制和教育体制的改革，更好地调动广大科技人员和教育工作者的积极性，推动科技事业和教育事业的发展。
    １９８９年我们面临的任务是巨大而繁重的。完成这些任务的条件也是具备的。从国际条件来看，全世界正从对抗转向对话，由紧张转向缓和，这种变化总的来说对我国是很有利的。我国有可能争取到一个长期稳定的国际环境，以集中力量搞好改革和四化建设。关键在于我们抓紧这个有利条件，克服种种不利因素，做好自己的工作，决不可贻误发展的良机。
    １９８９年将是我们的人民共和国诞生４０周年。让我们以更加勤奋扎实的工作，以改革和建设的新成就，迎接这个光辉节日的到来。
