There was a party member and leader who, because he acted as a "speculator," was recently caught during the rectification of economic order. Normally, he should feel deeply remorseful, reflect on his mistakes: he should not have done things that betrayed the party and the people, and instead learn from his mistakes, mend his ways, and gain wisdom from his failures. However, he did not. He kept pondering: why did others do so much for so many years, do so many "big things," and not even get their feet wet, while I just dipped my toes and got into trouble? What went wrong?

This "speculator" gained such "wisdom" naturally for the sake of harming the country and the people. By pondering like this, he might come up with some crooked ideas and evil experiences, and next time he speculates, he might be even more elusive, even evading the law's pursuit. After all, we are far from achieving "the law is everywhere," and the current "legal net" has many and large holes. Some cases reported in the newspapers show that some people's methods are very crude, not as skilled as this "speculator" in summarizing experiences. From committing the crime to being caught, it still takes several years!

If we want to achieve "reach out and get caught" instantly and completely eliminate some people's illegal and disorderly psychology of hoping to get away with it, it is obviously impossible. In my opinion, the timely medicine is to "catch one and punish one." For example, this "speculator," this time he was only caught, which can be considered a great misfortune within a great fortune. If he slips further, he might be killed. Let them see that great foolishness brings great fortune, and great wisdom brings great disaster. I do not believe there is anyone who "wants money but not life." From this, we can see that this "speculator's" way of thinking, for our serious legal system and the elimination of corruption, is indeed something to learn from.

### 长什么样的“智”

　　长什么样的“智”
    王建章
    有一位党员领导干部，因为充当“倒爷”，最近在整顿经济秩序之中，被“抓”住了。按说他应该痛心疾首，追悔反省：不该干对不起党和人民的事，从而总结教训，改邪归正，吃一堑，长一智。但是，他不，他老是琢磨：别人干了那么多年，干了那么多“大事”，连鞋都没湿，我怎么刚一下水就触了霉头，问题到底出在哪个环节上呢？要好好找一找教训。
    这个“倒爷”如此长“智”，自然是为了长害国、害人之“智”。他这样穷琢磨，或许能琢磨出些歪点子、邪经验，将来“倒”起来，或许神难知鬼难觉，甚至在法律的猎枪跟踪时也有些逃脱的“韬略”。因为我们还远未做到“法无不在”，现有的“法网”眼儿多而大。报上披露的一些案件中，有些人手法很拙劣，也不及这个“倒爷”会“总结”，从作案到落网尚需几年呢！
    如果我们想一下子做到“伸手必被捉”，彻底消除一些人违法乱纪的侥幸心理，显然不可能。愚以为，时药当是“抓住一个惩办一个”。比如这个“倒爷”，这一次仅是被抓，说起来，可以算是大不幸中之大幸，要是再滑下去，就可能被杀。让他们看到大“愚”大福，大“智”大祸，我就不相信真有人“要钱不要命”。由此可见，这个“倒爷”的想法，对于我们严肃法制，消除腐败现象，倒是有智可长的。
