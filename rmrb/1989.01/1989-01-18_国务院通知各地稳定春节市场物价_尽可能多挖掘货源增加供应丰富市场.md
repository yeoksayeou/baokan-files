The State Council issued a notice on January 16 to various regions and departments, stating that to ensure that the rate of price increases this year is significantly lower than last year, efforts must begin immediately. The notice requires all regions to stabilize market prices during the Spring Festival to ensure that the people can celebrate the festival happily.

The State Council's notice requires local governments to further strengthen the organizational work for the supply of festival goods, explore as many sources as possible, increase supply, and enrich the festival market. Special attention should be paid to the supply of major staple foods and daily necessities such as meat, eggs, and vegetables.

The State Council's notice requires local governments to ensure the supply of staple foods and daily necessities such as grain, oil, meat, sugar, salt, and staple vegetables, as well as essential industrial products like matches, soap, detergent, and toilet paper. Prices for these items must not be increased. For public utilities closely related to people's lives, such as water, electricity, gas, and transportation, as well as tuition and medical fees, prices must not be raised. For market-priced grain and oil, local governments must strengthen management and prevent middlemen from raising prices arbitrarily.

The notice points out that currently, some major daily-use industrial products are in short supply, and some have price chaos, which seriously affects production and supply. To increase effective supply, improve festival market supply, and prevent price hikes, the prices of a few daily-use industrial products such as aluminum pots and iron pots should be unified nationwide. Prices should be adjusted to ensure reasonable profits for producers and to rectify price hikes by middlemen.

The State Council's notice requires local governments to continue strengthening the management and guidance of price liberalization for commodities. For important industrial products, a price reporting system should be established, and regional, wholesale-retail, and other price differentials should be strictly controlled. For important agricultural products in market trading, maximum prices should be set when necessary. The notice also reminds local governments to take preventive measures in advance to ensure a stable supply of vegetables during the "spring lull" and to prevent price hikes during the vegetable off-season in spring.

The State Council's notice finally requires local governments to continue strengthening price inspections and mobilize the public to supervise market prices. Illegal price hikes during the festival should be severely punished.

　　国务院通知各地稳定春节市场物价
　　尽可能多挖掘货源增加供应丰富市场
    新华社北京１月１７日电  国务院１６日向各地方、各部门发出通知说，实现今年物价上涨幅度明显低于去年必须从新年一开始就认真抓紧。通知要求各地，为保证人民群众愉快地度过春节，必须坚决稳定春节市场的物价。
    国务院在通知中要求各地政府进一步抓紧落实节日商品供应的组织工作，尽可能多挖掘货源，增加供应，丰富节日市场。特别要做好肉、蛋、菜等主要副食品和日常生活必需工业品的供应。
    国务院在通知中要求各地对于城市定量供应的粮、油、肉、糖以及食盐、大路菜等主要食品，火柴、肥皂、洗衣粉、卫生纸等群众日常生活必需品，必须做到保证供应，不准脱销，价格一律不得提高。对于同群众生活关系密切的公用事业收费以及学费、医疗收费等，也不得提高。对于议价粮油的价格，各地要加强管理，制止中间环节乱加价。
    通知指出，当前，一部分主要日用工业品比较紧缺，其中有些品种价格混乱，对生产和供应有严重影响。为了有利于增加有效供给，改善节日市场供应，制止乱涨价，对于铝锅、铁锅等少数几种日用工业品的价格，全国要统一进行整顿，按生产有适当利润，大力整治中间环节乱涨价的原则，重新核价。
    国务院通知中要求各地继续加强对放开商品价格的管理和指导。工业品中比较重要的品种，要健全提价申报制度，严格控制地区、进销、批零等差价率。集市贸易的重要副食品，必要时应规定最高限价。通知还提醒各地及早采取预防措施，力争平稳度过蔬菜的“春淡”，避免春天蔬菜淡季价格出现暴涨。
    国务院的通知最后要求各地继续加强物价大检查，发动群众对市场物价进行监督。对节日期间乱涨价的违法行为，要大张旗鼓地惩治。
