The Chinese badminton team, which won 47 gold medals in international competitions in 1988, has started its campaigns in the new year. In January, they scored a beautiful victory in the Japanese Badminton Open, with Yang Yang and Li Lingwei winning the men's and women's singles titles, respectively. In the following months of February, March, and April, there will be more major competitions, but the most crucial match is the preparation for the World Championships to be held in Indonesia in May. This is the information revealed by the head coach of the Chinese badminton team today.

Head coach Wang Wentao said regarding this year's plans: The badminton team has a new approach to cultivating new talent, which is to break the mold and recruit young athletes under the age of 15 to join the team, thereby alleviating the shortage of reserve forces. It seems that we still need to urgently supplement new athletes. He hopes to receive support and assistance from all regions. Coach Wang also revealed that the Chinese badminton team will also cultivate and train new coaches, looking for suitable candidates. Currently, Luan Jin is already trying out as a coach within the team.

Last year, the national badminton team achieved significant results, and Wang Wentao required the entire team to maintain a calm mindset and see the problems even in victory.

The Chinese badminton team indeed has the strength, but the development of world badminton is relatively fast. If we do not hurry up to train our troops, there is a possibility of being defeated by others.

　　中国羽毛球队开始东征西战    
    王文教总教练强调培养新人
    本报北京一月二十五日讯  记者黄振中报道：一九八八年在国际大赛中夺得四十七枚金牌的中国羽毛球队在迈进新的一年时，又开始东征西战。一月份，他们在日本羽毛球公开赛中已打了一个漂亮的胜仗，杨阳、李玲蔚夺得男女单打冠军，接下来，二、三、四月都有大赛，但最关键的一仗是准备参加五月份在印尼举行的世界锦标赛。这是中国羽毛球队总教练今天透露的信息。
    王文教总教练在谈到今年的打算时说：羽毛球队培养新生力量有一条新做法，就是打破框框，吸收十五岁以下的小选手进队，使后备力量不足的矛盾得到缓和。现在看来还得抓紧不断补充新选手。他希望能得到各地的支持和帮助。王总教练还透露，中国羽毛球队还将培养锻炼新教练，寻找合适的人选。目前，栾劲已在队中试执教鞭。
    去年，国家羽毛球队成绩不小，王文教要求全队保持冷静头脑，胜利时要看到问题。
    中国羽毛球队确实有实力，但世界羽毛球运动发展较快，如果自己不抓紧练兵也有可能被别人打败。
