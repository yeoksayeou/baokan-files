Guangdong proposed that starting from 1985, it would take five years to green the entire province's barren mountains. Shaoguan City is one of the regions with the fastest progress. Recently, the province sent a work team to inspect, first calling to ask which places to look at. Shaoguan City replied: "Look anywhere you want." The inspection team of seven or eight people went to different places to look, and no barren mountains were found.

This phrase "look anywhere you want" reminded me of an old comrade's sigh. He said: "I used to love to go down and visit, but these past two years I don't want to go anymore. Wherever you go, you're followed by a crowd of people, going back and forth in just those two fixed 'tourist spots,' how much can you understand?"

For those who go down to inspect work or conduct interviews, this approach of "look anywhere you want" is gratifying and worth promoting. It is a spirit of seeking truth. Any unit that has taken a serious and responsible attitude towards implementing the correct instructions of higher authorities and has done its best to achieve results will not mind people looking anywhere.

Welcoming people to "look anywhere you want" is a manifestation of a high sense of responsibility for the people's cause. Those who truly serve the people wholeheartedly do not fear that others will discover shortcomings and problems in their work. On the contrary, they welcome others to help them discover shortcomings and problems, just as a mother hopes to timely discover what ailments her baby has, so as to timely treat and eliminate them.

### “想看哪里就看哪里”好

　　“想看哪里就看哪里”好
    官伟勋
    广东提出，从１９８５年开始，用５年时间绿化全省荒山。韶关市是进展最快的地区之一。不久前，省里派工作组去验收，先打电话问看哪些地方，韶关市回答：“想看哪里就看哪里。”检查组七八个人分头下去看，没发现一处荒山。
    这句“想看哪里就看哪里”，令我想起一位老同志的感叹。他说：“我过去很爱下去转，这两年不想去了。走到哪里都跟上一堆人，来来回回就在那么两个固定的‘旅游点’打转，能了解多少情况？”
    对于下去检查工作与下去采访的人来说，这种“想看哪里就看哪里”的做法，令人欣慰，值得提倡。这是一种求实精神。凡是对贯彻上级的正确指示采取了认真负责态度，并尽了最大努力做出成绩的单位，是不会在乎人家随便看哪里的。
    欢迎人家“想看哪里就看哪里”，是对人民事业具有高度责任感的表现。真正全心全意为人民服务的干部，不怕人家发现自己工作中的不足与问题。恰恰相反，他们欢迎人家帮助自己发现不足与问题，就像母亲希望及时发现自己的婴儿有些什么病痛，以便及时救治、消除一样。
