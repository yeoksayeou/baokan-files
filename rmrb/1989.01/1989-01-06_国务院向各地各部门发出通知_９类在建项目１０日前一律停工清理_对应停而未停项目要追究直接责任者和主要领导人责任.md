The State Council has issued a notice to all regions and departments, mandating that nine categories of ongoing fixed-asset investment projects must halt work within 10 days for cleanup. Direct and primary leaders will be held accountable for projects that should have stopped but have not.

According to a report by our reporter Lu Mu from Beijing on January 5, the State Council recently decided to implement a policy of "halt first, clean up later" for nine types of fixed-asset investment projects. Department heads, provincial governors, chairpersons of autonomous regions, and mayors are responsible for ensuring compliance at all levels. This was announced by a responsible comrade from the State Council's project cleanup leading group at a special meeting held today for the heads of the cleanup offices of various relevant departments and directly affiliated units of the State Council to convey and implement the State Council's "Notice on Further Cleanup of Ongoing Fixed-Asset Investment Projects."

The responsible comrade stated that after an initial round of cleanup, the situation of fixed-asset investment projects under state ownership has been basically clarified. Based on this, a batch of projects has been halted or slowed down, achieving some results. However, the achievements should not be overestimated, and the tasks of cleanup and reduction are still quite arduous. Up to now, many regions have not yet clarified the number of fixed-asset investment projects under the entire society. The scale of reduction for ongoing projects in regions with faster progress is only 6%, while in regions with slower progress, it is only 1%.

The responsible comrade emphasized that in the process of rectifying the environment, rectifying order, and deepening reforms, there is indeed a task of adjusting the industrial structure. However, this should not lead to neglecting or even ignoring the work of project cleanup and scale reduction. The phenomenon of only talking about structural adjustment while not paying attention to or originally having some reluctance towards cleanup and reduction is a problem that deserves attention. Currently, project cleanup should be further deepened, and the scale of investment should be truly reduced. On the basis of cleanup and reduction, industrial structure adjustment should be carried out.

The State Council's "Notice" decided to implement the "halt first, clean up later" policy for the following nine types of projects:

	— Projects that should be halted according to the provisions of the State Council's Document No. 64 (1988);
	— Projects that are outside the scope of the national fixed-asset investment plan for 1989;
	— Projects that, outside the fixed-asset investment loan plan approved by the State Planning Commission, are arranged by various levels of banks or non-bank financial institutions for loans or financing;
	— Projects that, without the approval of the State Council or the People's Bank of China, issue various bonds as a source of fixed-asset investment;
	— Projects that use working capital or other special funds for fixed-asset investment;
	— Projects that involve the construction of independent production workshops, the expansion of production capacity, and technical transformations that are not productive;
	— Projects for the construction of buildings, halls, and offices that, according to the provisions of the State Council's Document No. 71 (1988), did not reach the specified work volume by the end of October 1988;
	— Projects that were started without formal approval procedures;
	— Projects that did not purchase key enterprise bonds as required.

The "Notice" requires that all the above-mentioned types of projects must halt construction by January 10, with no excuses for delay. Various departments and regions must expedite the cleanup and review to determine whether to halt or slow down, and publish and report in batches as they are determined. The cleanup offices, audit departments, and statistical departments at all levels must fully play their roles in audit and supervision. For projects that should have halted but have not, the direct responsible persons and primary leaders will be held accountable.

The "Notice" also proposed specific requirements for the follow-up work of halted and slowed-down projects. It emphasized that this work is related to the protection of state property and social stability. Leaders at all levels must personally oversee and strengthen ideological and political work; relevant departments must specifically organize and implement, prevent bureaucratism and simplistic approaches, and gain the understanding and support of the masses.

　　国务院向各地各部门发出通知
  　９类在建项目１０日前一律停工清理
    对应停而未停项目要追究直接责任者和主要领导人责任
    本报北京１月５日讯  记者鲁牧报道：国务院最近决定对９种情况的固定资产投资项目实行先停工后清理，并由部长、省长、自治区主席、市长负责，层层落实。这是国务院清理项目领导小组负责同志在今天专门召开的国务院各有关部门、直属单位清理办负责人会议上，传达、贯彻国务院《关于进一步清理固定资产投资在建项目的通知》时宣布的。
    这位负责人说，前一段经过初步清理，基本查清了全民所有制投资项目的情况，并在此基础上停缓建了一批项目，取得了一定的成绩。但是，对成绩不能估计过高，清理、压缩任务还相当艰巨。到目前为止，仍有相当多的地区尚未查清全社会固定资产投资在建项目的底数；对在建项目压缩的规模，进展快的地区也只压了６％，进展慢的仅压了１％。
    这位负责人强调指出，在治理环境、整顿秩序、深化改革中，确有一个调整产业结构的任务，但不能因此而放松甚至忽视清理项目、压缩规模的工作。那种只讲调整结构，而对清理、压缩不重视或者原来就有些勉强的现象，是值得引起注意的问题。当前，应当把清理项目进一步引向深入，将投资规模切实压下来。在清理、压缩的基础上，进行产业结构的调整。
    国务院《通知》中决定实行“先停后清”的９类项目是：
    ——属于国发（１９８８）６４号文件规定停建的；
    ——属于１９８９年国家下达的固定资产投资计划以外的；
    ——在国家计委批准的固定资产投资贷款计划以外，由各级银行或非银行金融机构安排贷款或融资的项目；
    ——未经国务院或中国人民银行总行批准，自行发行各种债券作为固定资产投资来源的项目；
    ——挪用流动资金或其它专项资金作为固定资产投资来源的项目；
    ——单纯新建的独立生产车间、单纯扩大生产能力和非生产性建设的技术改造项目；
    ——按国发（１９８８）７１号文件规定，在１９８８年１０月底未达到规定工作量的楼堂馆所项目；
    ——未履行正式审批手续，擅自开工建设的项目；
    ——未按规定认购重点企业债券的项目。
    《通知》要求，上述各类项目必须在１月１０日前一律停止施工，不得以任何理由拖延。各部门、各地区要抓紧清理、审核，确定是否停缓建，确定一批就公布一批，上报一批。各级清理办、审计部门、统计部门要充分发挥审计、监督作用。对应停而未停的项目，要追究直接责任者和主要领导人的责任。
    《通知》还对停缓建项目的善后工作提出了具体要求。并强调这项工作关系到保护国家财产和社会安定，各级领导要亲自过问，加强思想政治工作；有关部门要具体组织落实，防止官僚主义和简单化的作法，取得群众的谅解和支持。
