Central and local authorities have seriously handled proposals from CPPCC members. According to statistics, out of the 2005 proposals submitted by members at the 7th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), 1920 have been responded to by the relevant departments. The remaining 85 proposals are more complex and involve a wide range of issues, requiring in-depth research and coordination.

It is understood that among these 1920 proposals, many have been adopted by relevant parties. The proposal by Zhang Xuchang on "solving the power shortage in Qinhuangdao" has been approved by the State Planning Commission, which has agreed to build two 200,000-kilowatt heating units for the first phase of the Qinhuangdao Power Plant. The preliminary work for the project is currently underway. Liu Peizhi's proposal on "large-scale trial planting of the 'high-quality ton rice' new variety" has been adopted by the Ministry of Agriculture, which will arrange for trials and demonstrations this year, gradually expanding the scope. Zhang Mengshi's proposal on "solving the pollution problem of the Li River" has been adopted by the Guilin Municipal Government, which is currently working on the garbage treatment for Li River tourist boats. The Guilin Municipal Government has also stipulated that garbage from Li River tourist boats must be handed over to the Yangshuo Pier for processing, and violators will be fined. In the proposal "strengthening the education of customs personnel," Dong Zhujun pointed out some problems in the work style and appearance of personnel at the capital airport customs. The General Administration of Customs has paid great attention to this, instructing the relevant departments to work with the Beijing Customs to conduct education and rectification, and issuing a notice to all levels of customs to improve work style, perfect relevant systems, and promote the spiritual civilization construction of customs.

　　中央和地方认真办理政协提案    
    已答复委员的有一千九百余件
    新华社北京１月２０日电（通讯员丁京玉）中央和地方有关部门认真办理政协委员提案，据统计，全国政协七届一次会议上委员提出的２００５件提案中，已有１９２０件提案分别由承办单位答复了委员。另外有８５件提案因问题较为复杂，牵涉面广，需要做深入的调研和协调。
    据了解，在这１９２０件提案中，有不少已经得到有关方面的采纳。张遐昌委员提出的关于“解决秦皇岛供电紧张”的提案，国家计委已批复秦皇岛电厂一期工程建设两台２０万千瓦供热机组，工程的前期工作正在积极进行当中。刘培植委员“关于大面积试种‘优质吨谷’新品种”的提案，已被农业部采纳，将在今年安排试验、示范，以逐步扩大。张梦实委员关于“解决漓江污染问题”的提案，已被桂林市人民政府采纳，漓江游船垃圾处理工作正在抓紧进行。桂林市政府还规定，对漓江游船上的垃圾统一交由阳朔码头处理，对违反规定者处以罚款。董竹君委员在“应加强对海关人员教育”的提案中，对首都机场海关人员在关风、关貌中存在的一些问题提出了批评。海关总署对此十分重视，责成主管部门协同北京市海关进行教育整顿，并向全国海关下发通知，要求各级海关整顿工作作风，完善有关制度，促进海关的精神文明建设。
