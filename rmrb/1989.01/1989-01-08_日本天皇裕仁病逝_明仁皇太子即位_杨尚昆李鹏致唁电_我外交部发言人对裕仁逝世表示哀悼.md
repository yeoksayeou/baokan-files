Japanese Emperor Hirohito Passes Away, Crown Prince Akihito Ascends to the Throne

Yang Shangkun and Li Peng Send Condolences

China's Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Expresses Condolences for Hirohito's Passing

BEIJING, Jan. 7 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Emperor Hirohito passed away this morning at 6:33 a.m. in his palace in Tokyo. Crown Prince Akihito ascended to the throne the same day, becoming the new emperor.

Hirohito, who was 87 years old, died from complications related to duodenal cancer. He was the 124th emperor of Japan. He began his regency in November 1921 and ascended to the throne in December 1926, making him the longest-reigning emperor in Japanese history, with a reign of 62 years and 14 days.

Before the war, Hirohito was considered the "living god" of Japan. During his reign, Japan launched the Sino-Japanese War and the Pacific War. After the war, Hirohito became the "symbol of the state and the unity of the people" as stipulated in the Japanese Constitution. According to the Japanese Constitution and imperial house laws, 55-year-old Crown Prince Akihito ascended to the throne today as the 125th emperor. The "Showa" era thus came to an end.

The Japanese Cabinet's second extraordinary meeting decided that Akihito's reign would be named "Heisei." "Heisei" is derived from the Chinese classics "Records of the Grand Historian" and "Book of Documents," meaning "peace within and success without," and "peace on earth and in heaven." It signifies the realization of peace both domestically and internationally.

It is reported that the Japanese government will hold a funeral for Hirohito on February 24.

BEIJING, Jan. 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Yang Shangkun and Premier Li Peng sent separate condolence messages to Japanese Emperor Akihito and Prime Minister Takeshita Noboru today, expressing their sorrow over the passing of Emperor Hirohito.

BEIJING, Jan. 7 (Xinhua) -- A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said today, "We express our condolences for the passing of Japanese Emperor Hirohito."

The spokesperson, in response to a journalist's question, said that after the normalization of diplomatic relations between China and Japan, Hirohito had met with Chinese leaders visiting Japan on multiple occasions. He had expressed remorse for the past unfortunate history and hoped for the long-term friendly relations between China and Japan. The spokesperson said, "We sincerely hope that Sino-Japanese relations can continue to develop on the basis of the Sino-Japanese Joint Communiqué and the Treaty of Peace and Friendship between China and Japan."

　　日本天皇裕仁病逝　明仁皇太子即位
  　杨尚昆李鹏致唁电
    我外交部发言人对裕仁逝世表示哀悼
    本报东京１月７日电  记者孙东民、于青报道：日本国天皇裕仁，今天上午清晨６时３３分在他位于东京都内的皇宫里病逝。皇太子明仁于同日上午即位成为新天皇。
    今年８７岁的裕仁是因患十二指肠癌医治无效而去世的。裕仁是日本第１２４代天皇。他于１９２１年１１月起摄政，１９２６年１２月即位，是日本历史上在位时间最长的天皇（６２年零１４天）。
    裕仁天皇战前是统治日本的“现人神”。他在位期间，日本曾发动过侵华战争和太平洋战争。战后裕仁是日本宪法规定的“国家和国民联合的象征”。按照日本宪法和皇室典范，５５岁的明仁皇太子今天继任为第１２５代天皇。“昭和”年号就此结束。
    日本内阁第二次临时会议决定明仁天皇的年号为“平成”。“平成”典出中国《史记·五帝本纪》及《书经·大禹谟》，即“内平外成”、“地平天成”二语，“平成”有国内外、天地间都要实现和平的意思。
    据报道，日本政府决定２月２４日为裕仁天皇举行葬礼。
    新华社北京１月７日电　中华人民共和国主席杨尚昆、国务院总理李鹏今天分别向日本天皇明仁和日本首相竹下登发出唁电，对裕仁天皇逝世表示哀悼。
    新华社北京１月７日电　外交部发言人今天说，“我们对日本裕仁天皇陛下的逝世表示哀悼。”
    这位发言人在回答记者的提问时说，在中日实现邦交正常化后，裕仁天皇曾多次会见过访日的中国领导人，对过去那一段不幸历史表示了反省之意，关心并希望中日两国发展长期睦邻友好关系。他说，“我们衷心希望中日关系能够在中日联合声明和中日和平友好条约的基础上不断得到新的发展。”
