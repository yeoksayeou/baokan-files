	Severe Talent Drain in Developing Countries

	According to incomplete statistics from Algeria's "Struggle" newspaper and other sources, between 1960 and 1986, a total of 1.3 million technical immigrants from developing countries moved to the United States, Canada, Britain, and other Western European countries. Arab countries lose 17,000 engineers and 24,000 doctors annually, accounting for 23% of the total number of professional and technical personnel in Arab countries. Egypt saw approximately 33,000 scientists and engineers emigrate between 1966 and 1976, with 40% of them being senior scientists. Currently, Egypt has around 400,000 technical personnel abroad. Before 1980, the Philippines had 114,000 technical personnel emigrate, with 80% of them going to the United States. By 1980, India had lost 233,000 talents, accounting for 12% of India's scientists, engineers, and doctors. Nearly 25% of foreign students in the United States who obtain positions as scientists or engineers choose to settle in the United States, with the majority of these students coming from developing countries.

	The large-scale outflow of talent has caused significant economic and social development losses for developing countries, which are already relatively backward. Some foreign estimates suggest that the total investment, including both public and private funds, required to train a professional and technical personnel from elementary school to university is between $50,000 and $100,000. If we use this standard, the direct economic loss incurred by developing countries due to the loss of 1.3 million talents would be between $650 billion and $1.3 trillion. The indirect losses are even more difficult to calculate.

	Many developed countries have benefited from the talent drain from developing countries. According to estimates by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, from 1962 to 1972, the United States saved an average of over $200 million in educational expenses annually due to the influx of foreign talent. In the early 1980s, approximately one in six practicing doctors in the United States was from a developing country, and one in twelve PhD scientists and engineers was born in Asia.

　　发展中国家人才外流严重
    据阿尔及利亚《奋斗》报和其他资料的不完全统计，在１９６０—１９８６年的２７年内，发展中国家流入美国、加拿大、英国和西欧等其他国家的技术移民，总数达１３０万人。阿拉伯国家一年外流的工程师有１．７万人，医生有２．４万人，占阿拉伯国家专业技术人员总数的２３％。埃及１９６６—１９７６年约有３．３万的科学家和工程师移居海外，其中４０％是高级科学家，目前埃及在国外的技术人员已达４０万。菲律宾，１９８０年前共有１１．４万技术人员流到国外，其中８０％流向美国。印度到１９８０年外流人才达２３．３万人，占印度科学家、工程师和医生总人数的１２％。在美国的外国学生，有近２５％取得科学家或工程师地位后定居美国，这些学生主要来自发展中国家。
    人才大量外流，给本来就比较落后的发展中国家的经济、社会发展造成重大损失。国外有人计算，培养一名专业技术人员，从小学、中学到大学，国家和私人的总数投资为５—１０万美元。若按此标准，发展中国家流失１３０万名人才造成的直接经济损失就有６５０—１３００亿美元，至于间接损失更无法计算了。
    许多发达国家成了发展中国家人才外流的受益者。据联合国贸发会议估计，仅１９６２—１９７２年，由于外裔人才流入，美国平均每年节省２０多亿美元的教育经费。８０年代初，美国大约每６名现职医生中就有１人来自发展中国家，每１２位博士科学家和工程师中，有１人是出生在亚洲。
