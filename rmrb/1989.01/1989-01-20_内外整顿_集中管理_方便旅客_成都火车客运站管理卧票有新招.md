	Internal and External Rectification, Centralized Management, Convenience for Passengers
	Chengdu Railway Passenger Station Implements New Measures for Managing Sleeper Tickets

	According to a report from our correspondent Luomaocheng: Chengdu Railway Passenger Station has switched from telephone booking to written ticket requests. Simultaneously, all sleeper tickets are now subject to destination registration. This has reduced the number of station leaders seeking tickets and ticket scalpers, increased the availability of sleeper tickets at the ticket windows, and generally satisfied both passengers and ticket booking units.

	Previously, Chengdu Passenger Station's management of sleeper tickets was quite lax. Apart from the ticket office, the planning department, booking office, special windows, and some station leaders all held a certain number of sleeper tickets. There was also no strict management of ticket booking units, which provided convenience for illegal ticket scalping activities, much to the dismay of the general public.

	To improve this chaotic situation and effectively combat ticket scalping, Chengdu Passenger Station has centralized all sleeper tickets in the planning department, which then distributes them to the city ticket office, station ticket office, and transfer certification office. This change has increased the number of sleeper tickets available for city pre-sales by over 100 per day. Additionally, for contract booking units, the station has switched from telephone booking to written requests. Booking units need only register the number of tickets required the day before, and the station will deliver the tickets the next day. This change has greatly convenience booking units. Originally, with telephone booking, only about 100 units could be accommodated daily. Now, with the new system, approximately 150-160 booking units can be satisfied. At the same time, long-distance sleeper tickets are now subject to mandatory destination registration. Which units and individuals purchased which tickets on which dates and trains are all recorded.

　　内外整顿　集中管理　方便旅客
    成都火车客运站管理卧票有新招
    本报讯  记者罗茂城报道：成都火车客运站改电话订票为投单订票，同时，对所有卧票全部实行去向登记，从而找车站领导要票和倒卖车票的人少了，售票窗口出售的卧票增加了，旅客和订票单位均较为满意。
    成都客运站过去对卧票的管理比较松散，除售票处以外，计划室、订票室、特殊窗口，以及一些站领导手中均握有一定数量的卧票。对订票单位也没有严格管理，为一些不法分子倒卖活动提供了方便，广大旅客意见很大。
    为改善这一混乱现象，有效地打击倒卖车票的活动，成都客运站把全部卧票集中到计划室，由计划室统一分配给市内售票处、站内售票处和中转签证处三个部门。这样一改，市内预售票每天即可增加１００多张卧票。另外，对合同订票单位改电话订票为投单订票，订票单位只要头天把所要票数登记好，火车站第二天即可送票上门。这样一改，大大方便了订票单位。原用电话订票，每天只能约订１００家，现在一改，一百五六十家订票单位基本上均能满足。与此同时，对长途卧票一律实行去向登记。哪些单位、哪些人买了哪天哪次几号座卧票，均要登记。
