Shanghai's *Liberation Daily* reported that since the fame of the director of the Hangzhou Universal Joint Factory, Lu Guanqiu, the factory has been flooded with guests. According to incomplete statistics, from January to October 1988, there were more than 1,000 groups totaling 14,329 people who came to the factory under the pretext of visiting or learning from the factory. Such a small universal joint factory, of course, cannot handle so many visitors!

The term "learning from others" has been popular since the journey of the Tang Monk and his disciples to the West. It is both humble and diligent, and it shows a spirit of learning. Unfortunately, this term has gradually been misused by some impostors. They do not have the hardships of traveling through mountains and rivers, nor do they need to think about what lessons can be learned from these advanced examples for their own region or unit. Even if they have some "insights," these are just a few official phrases that can be thought of while sitting at home. Thus, they simply take the ready-made introduction materials from others and take the opportunity to visit famous mountains and rivers. The reason why the Universal Joint Factory attracts so many people is probably because the factory is located in the scenic city of Hangzhou, known for its "mountains beyond mountains, towers beyond towers."

This is also a great waste. 14,000 people, with an average expenditure of 100 yuan per person, amounts to 1.4 million yuan! To waste such a large sum of money without benefiting reform (or at least without much benefit) is truly regrettable.

　　这也是一种浪费
    项东
    上海《解放日报》报道，杭州万向节厂厂长鲁冠球出名以来，工厂里宾客如云。据不完全统计，１９８８年１至１０月，以参观、取经等名义而来的有１０００多批１４３２９人。一个小小的万向节厂，当然招架不住了！
    “取经”一词，自唐僧师徒到西天走那一趟始，至今仍非常流行，显得既谦虚谨慎，又勤奋好学，多好！可惜后来渐渐被一些滥竽充数的假唐僧钻了空子。他们既没有跋山涉水的旅途劳顿之苦，又不必动脑筋想一想这种先进典型经验对本地区本单位到底有何启示，即使有几句“心得体会”，也是坐在家里都可以想得出来的几句官腔。于是只管伸手“取”别人现成的介绍材料，顺便到名山大川兜一兜风。万向节厂所以吸引人，一大半的原因恐怕是因为厂址在“山外青山楼外楼”的杭州。
    这也是一种巨大的浪费。１４０００多人，每人平均开支１００元，就是１４０多万！白白耗此巨资，却与改革无补（至少无甚大补），岂不可惜。
