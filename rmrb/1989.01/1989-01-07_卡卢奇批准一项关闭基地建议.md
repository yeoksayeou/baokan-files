U.S. Secretary of Defense Kaluzhi approved a proposal to close and adjust military bases on the 5th. This proposal, submitted by a special committee, aims to "strengthen defense and save expenses." It involves 145 outdated military facilities, of which 34 military bases will be completely closed. It is estimated that this move by the United States will save $693 million annually.

Kaluzhi said at a press conference that this proposal was submitted to him by the special committee at the end of last year and was approved after discussions with the heads of various military departments and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

　　卡卢奇批准一项关闭基地建议
    美国国防部长卡卢奇五日批准一项关闭和调整军事基地的建议。
    这项由一个特别委员会提出的建议旨在“加强国防和节省开支”。该建议涉及一百四十五个过时的军事设施，其中三十四个军事基地将完全关闭。据估计，美国的这一举动将每年节省六点九三亿美元。
    卡卢奇在记者招待会上说，这项建议是特别委员会去年年底向他提出并经同各军事部门的负责人及参谋长联席会议主席讨论后批准的。
