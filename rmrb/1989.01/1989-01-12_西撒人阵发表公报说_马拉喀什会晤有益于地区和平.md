The Polisario Front issued a statement saying that the Marrakech meeting laid the foundation for mutual trust between the Polisario Front and Morocco.

This statement was issued after the Polisario Front's executive committee held a special meeting following the first meeting between the Polisario Front's high-level delegation and Moroccan King Hassan II in Marrakech last week.

The statement said that the meeting "removed mutual mistrust" and paved the way for sincere and friendly dialogue between the two sides and for "achieving regional stability."

The statement also said that the Marrakech meeting played a positive role in seeking a peaceful solution to the Western Sahara issue and in ultimately reaching an agreement between the Polisario Front and Morocco.

　　西撒人阵发表公报说
    马拉喀什会晤有益于地区和平
    新华社阿尔及尔１月９日电  波利萨里奥阵线（西撒人阵）执委会８日发表公报说，马拉喀什会晤奠定了西撒人阵和摩洛哥相互信任的基础。
    这项公报是在上星期西撒人阵高级代表团和摩洛哥国王哈桑二世在马拉喀什首次会晤后，西撒人阵执行委员会最近举行特别会议后发表的。
    公报说，这次会晤“消除了双方的不信任”，为双方进行诚挚友好的对话和“实现地区稳定”铺平了道路。
    公报还说，马拉喀什会晤为寻求和平解决西撒哈拉问题，为使西撒人阵和摩洛哥最终达成协议发挥了积极作用。
