Hainan Province's telecommunications infrastructure has shown significant progress. The entire province has completed and opened 15,600 local telephone lines.

Xinhua News Agency, Haikou: (Reporter Chen Jiang) Hainan Economic Special Zone is accelerating the construction of its telecommunications infrastructure to improve communication conditions. Last year, the entire province completed and opened 15,600 local telephone lines. Currently, 16 cities and counties in Hainan have automatic telephone services. The telecommunications conditions between Hainan and mainland cities, as well as Hong Kong and Macau, have also improved.

Since Hainan became a province, the volume of postal and telecommunications services has surged. To alleviate the tight telecommunications situation, Hainan's postal and telecommunications departments have accelerated the development of urban telephones. They have successively upgraded and newly built communication facilities in Haikou, Sanya, Qionghai, Wanning, Baoting, Tunchang, Baisha, and Tongshan, installing program-controlled telephones and other types of automatic telephones. This has significantly improved urban and town telephone communications across the province. Statistics show that currently, Hainan's cities and towns have a total of over 26,400 automatic telephones, more than double the number of automatic telephones the province had last year.

Hainan has also strengthened the construction to improve telecommunications with the mainland and Hong Kong and Macau regions. Last year, Hainan added 91 long-distance circuits to provinces outside Hainan and 4 telegraph circuits. Some key postal and telecommunications construction projects have either started or are in the process of preparing. The construction of satellite communication ground stations in Haikou, Sanya, and Yangpu has begun.

    新华社海口电  （记者陈江）海南经济特区加紧邮电建设，改善通讯条件。去年全省共建成开通使用的市内电话达１５６００门。目前全省有１６个市县已用上自动电话。海南与我国内地城市及港澳地区的邮电通讯条件也有所改善。
    海南建省后，邮电通讯业务量猛增。为了改善邮电通讯紧张状况，海南邮电部门加快了城市电话的发展。先后在海口、三亚、琼海、万宁、保亭、屯昌、白沙、通什等市县进行改造、新建通讯设施，安装程控电话和其他品种的自动电话，使全省城市、城镇电话通讯有了较大改善。据统计，目前海南城市、城镇拥有自动电话总量已达２６４００多门，比上年全省拥有的自动电话数增长了一倍多。
    海南改善与内地及港澳地区通讯条件的建设也有所加强。去年海南新增加了９１条至省外的长途电路，新增电报电路４条。一些重点邮电通讯建设项目，有的已经动工或正在加紧进行前期准备工作。在海口、三亚、洋浦三地建设卫星通讯地面站的工作业已开始。
