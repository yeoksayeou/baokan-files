Soviet forces in Afghanistan have begun dismantling their military facilities in various parts of the country and are preparing for a full withdrawal, a spokesman for Pakistan's Foreign Ministry said today.

The spokesman, speaking at a news conference in Islamabad, said Pakistan has not received any reports of Soviet troops crossing the Soviet-Afghan border, but their actions indicate they are preparing to withdraw.

He said Soviet troops are moving towards the border and some units are heading towards the Soviet-Afghan highway.

The Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979, deploying 115,000 troops. According to the Geneva Accords signed last April, the Soviet Union is to withdraw all its troops from Afghanistan by February 15 this year. By August 15 last year, the Soviet Union had withdrawn half of its troops from Afghanistan.

Boris Gromov, the Soviet commander in Afghanistan, said in an interview with a television reporter yesterday that his troops will leave Afghanistan as planned by mid-February.

The New China News Agency reported from Islamabad today that Afghan resistance forces said the Seven-Party Alliance will announce the formation of a consultative committee in the near future and plans to hold the first meeting of the committee on February 1.

The source said the consultative committee will be composed of representatives from the Seven-Party Alliance based in Pakistan, the Eight-Party Alliance based in Iran, as well as commanders of the Afghan Mujahideen, refugees, and intellectuals.

The purpose of forming the consultative committee is to establish a broad-based provisional government to manage Afghanistan after the Soviet withdrawal.

The source added that the consultative committee will only be responsible to the provisional government. Once the provisional government is established, the consultative committee will automatically dissolve. Members of the provisional government will be recommended by the highest council of the Seven-Party Alliance, and the consultative committee has the right to accept or reject the recommended government. If a recommended government is rejected, the highest council will recommend another government.

He said they hope that the provisional government established last year, led by Ahmad Shah, will be the first to be recommended.

He said that after the provisional government is officially established, it will organize elections in Afghanistan.

Recently, the Soviet side has indicated that if the consultative committee includes representatives from the People's Democratic Party in Kabul, the Soviet Union will recognize it. However, the resistance forces have rejected the Soviet proposal, agreeing only to absorb "good Muslims" from the Kabul government.

　　驻阿苏军已准备全部撤军
    阿抵抗力量将成立协商委员会组建临时政府
    新华社伊斯兰堡１月１６日电  巴基斯坦外交部发言人今天说，苏联军队已开始在阿富汗各地拆除其军事设施，准备全部撤军。
    这位发言人在伊斯兰堡举行的新闻发布会上说，巴基斯坦未得到苏联军队跨越苏阿边界的消息，但他们的行动表明他们正准备撤退。
    他说，苏联的部队正在向边界方向移动，一些部队正开向阿苏公路。
    苏联于１９７９年入侵阿富汗，共投入１１．５万军人。根据去年４月日内瓦协议，苏联将于今年２月１５日前全部撤军。去年８月１５日前，苏已将驻阿军队撤出一半。
    苏联在阿富汗驻军总司令鲍里斯·格罗莫夫昨天接受一家电视记者采访时说，他的部队将于２月中前按计划全部离开阿富汗。
    新华社伊斯兰堡１月１７日电　阿富汗抵抗力量人士今天说，７党联盟将在近日内宣布成立协商委员会，并计划于２月１日举行协商委员会首次会议。
    这位人士说，协商委员会将由以巴基斯坦为基地的７党联盟和以伊朗为基地的８党联盟以及阿富汗游击队指挥官、难民和知识分子等代表组成。
    成立协商委员会的目的是由它来负责建一个基础广泛的临时政府，以便在苏联从阿富汗撤军后来管理阿富汗。
    这位人士还说，协商委员会只对临时政府负责，一旦临时政府成立，协商委员会将自动解散。临时政府成员将由７党联盟最高委员会推荐，协商委员会有权接受或反对推荐的政府。如果一个推荐的政府遭到反对，最高委员会将重新推荐另外一个政府。
    他说，他们希望去年成立的以艾哈迈德·沙阿为首的临时政府首先得到推荐。
    他说，临时政府正式成立后，它将在阿富汗组织举行大选。
    最近，苏联方面表示，如果协商委员会也有喀布尔政权的人民民主党代表参加，苏联将予以承认。但抵抗力量拒绝接受苏联的建议，只同意吸收喀布尔政权中“表现好的穆斯林”。
