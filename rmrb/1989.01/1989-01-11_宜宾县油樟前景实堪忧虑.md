In 1988, Yibin County's oil camphor production saw the phenomenon of premature harvesting of camphor leaves and plundering of camphor leaves. Due to harvesting camphor leaves 30 days earlier, the oil yield of the leaves significantly decreased, resulting in the county producing 100 tons less camphor oil last year.

The reasons for this problem are as follows: First, the theft by a few greedy individuals led farmers to harvest camphor leaves prematurely. Some households even cut down camphor trees that are far from their residences and inconvenient to manage. Second, in order to harvest more camphor leaves, approximately 60% of the oil camphor trees in Yibin County had their branches cut off and their tops pruned. Third, the multi-channel rush to purchase camphor oil also encouraged farmers to harvest camphor leaves indiscriminately.

　　宜宾县油樟前景实堪忧虑
    １９８８年，宜宾县油樟生产中出现提前采摘樟叶，掠夺性采摘樟叶的现象。由于提前３０多天采摘樟叶，致使樟叶出油率大大降低，全县去年少收樟油１００吨左右。
    出现这一问题的原因是：一、少数利欲熏心者的偷盗，使农民提前采摘樟叶，个别农户甚至砍掉离住宅较远、不便管理的樟树；二、为了多采樟叶，宜宾县约６０％的油樟树被砍掉树枝，削去树梢。三、由于多渠道抢购樟油，也促使了农民大肆采摘樟叶。
