	Supplementing the Shortfalls in State and Collective School Establishments
	230 Private Schools Established in the Mountains of Xinyang

	Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, January 15th — (Reporter Yin Daofu) In recent years, the Xinyang region of Henan Province has, based on local conditions, advocated for private education to supplement the shortcomings in state and collective school establishments. This has significantly increased the enrollment rates of school-age children in remote mountainous areas.

	The Xinyang region is located in the Dabie Mountains, where farmhouses are scattered, making it inconvenient for children to attend school. In the spring of 1981, Li Guangshou, a Communist Party member from Guozui Village in Wangliu Township, Guishi County, used his spare rooms to establish the first private school in the region in the Li Gang village group, solving the schooling problem for more than 50 children in the nearby remote mountainous area. This private school quickly caught the attention of various levels of party organizations and relevant government departments in the Xinyang region. They carefully summarized the experience, promoted it, and formulated policies to support individual education, leading to a rapid development of private schools across the region.

	Currently, there are 230 private schools in the region, with over 300 classes and more than 11,000 students enrolled. The teaching staff has grown to over 340 people.

	These private schools are mostly established using spare rooms owned by individuals or collectives. The teachers are mainly private teachers who have previously engaged in teaching, retired public school teachers, and high school or junior high school graduates who have returned to their hometowns. They follow the national "Educational Outline" for teaching and often participate in teaching observations and various professional research activities at central primary schools or village-run primary schools, making the schools better and better. Over 80% of the private school students in the region who participated in local examinations ranked among the top.

　　补充国家和集体办学布点之不足
    信阳山区办起２３０所私人学校
    新华社郑州１月１５日电（记者尹道夫）河南信阳地区近年来从当地实际出发，提倡私人办学，以补充国家和集体办学布点的不足，使一些偏僻山区适龄儿童入学率大为提高。
    信阳地区位于大别山区，农户居住分散，儿童就学十分不便。１９８１年春，固始县往流乡郭围村共产党员李广寿，利用自己几间空房，首先在李岗村民组办起了全区第一所私办学校，解决了附近偏僻山区５０多名儿童的上学问题。这所私办学校，很快引起信阳地区各级党组织和政府有关部门的重视。他们认真总结经验，宣传推广，并制定扶持个人办学的政策，使个人办学迅速在全区发展起来。
    现在，全区共办起私人学校２３０所，３００多个教学班，在校学生１１０００多人，教师队伍发展到３４０多人。
    这些私办学校大都是利用自己或集体闲房创办起来的。教师都是原来从事过教学工作的民办教师、退休公办教师和回乡高初中毕业生等。他们按照国家《教育大纲》进行教学，还经常到一些中心小学或村办小学进行教学观摩，参与各种业务教研活动，使学校越办越好。全区私办学校学生参加当地统考，８０％以上的学校考试成绩都居于前列。
