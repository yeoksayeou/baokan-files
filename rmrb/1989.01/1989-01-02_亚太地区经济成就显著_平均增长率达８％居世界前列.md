The Asia-Pacific region's economic achievements are remarkable, with an average growth rate of 8% leading the world.

	Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, December 28th - According to the figures released by the Executive Secretary of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, Killeen, on December 28th, the average economic growth rate of developing countries in the Asia-Pacific region in 1988 reached 8%.

	Killeen reviewed the economic development of the Asia-Pacific region in 1988 and made a forecast for the next year at a press conference held at the headquarters of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific on December 28th.

	He said that the estimated global economic growth rate for 1988 is 3.8%, the economic growth rate of developed countries is 3.9%, and the economic growth rate of developing countries is 3.6%. The economic growth rate of developing countries in the Asia-Pacific region once again leads the world.

	He said that in 1988, among the developing countries and regions in the Asia-Pacific region, South Korea, Singapore, and Thailand were at the forefront of economic development. Their economic growth rates reached 10% to 11%. Thailand achieved a double-digit growth rate for the first time in 10 years. The average growth rate of Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan was 9.2%. China's economic growth rate was 8.5%. The average economic growth rates of Southeast Asia and South Asia increased from 4.9% and 2.7% in 1987 to 6.4% and 8% respectively.

	Killeen also pointed out that most of the 11 least developed countries in the Asia-Pacific region had very low economic growth rates in 1988. Among them, the economic growth rate of Bangladesh in the 1987-1988 fiscal year dropped from 4.1% in the previous year to 2.5%.

	The main reasons for the rapid economic development of developing countries in the Asia-Pacific region this year are: the recovery of agricultural production in South Asia and Southeast Asia after being affected by adverse weather last year, the strong development of industry and exports, and the rapid growth of investment.

	Killeen pointed out, "The rapid development of the industrial sector is an important factor driving economic growth this year."

	Killeen also made a prediction for the economic situation next year. He said that the economy of developing countries in the Asia-Pacific region will continue to develop next year, but the growth rate will slow down, with an estimated average growth rate of 6.5%.

　　亚太地区经济成就显著
    平均增长率达８％居世界前列
    新华社曼谷１２月２８日电  （记者黄勇）据联合国亚太经社理事会执行秘书基勒里亚１２月２８日在这里公布的数字，亚太地区发展中国家１９８８年经济平均增长率达８％。
    基勒里亚１２月２８日在亚太经社理事会总部举行的记者招待会上对亚太地区１９８８年经济发展状况作了回顾并对明年经济发展作了展望。
    他说，１９８８年世界经济增长率估计为３．８％，发达国家的经济增长率为３．９％，发展中国家的经济增长率为３．６％。亚太地区发展中国家的经济增长率又一次处于领先地位。
    他说，１９８８年亚太地区发展中国家和地区中南朝鲜、新加坡和泰国的经济发展速度处于前列。它们的经济增长率达到１０％至１１％。泰国１０年来第一次取得两位数的增长率。香港、南朝鲜、新加坡和台湾的平均增长率为９．２％。中国的经济增长率为８．５％。东南亚和南亚地区的平均经济增长率分别从１９８７年的４．９％和２．７％增加到６．４％和８％。
    基勒里亚同时指出，亚太地区的１１个最不发达国家的大多数，１９８８年经济增长率仍然很低。其中，孟加拉国１９８７—１９８８财政年度的经济增长率从上年度的４．１％下降到２．５％。
    亚太地区发展中国家今年经济发展速度快的主要原因是：南亚和东南亚的农业生产在去年遭受不良气候影响后今年得到恢复、工业和出口的强有力发展以及投资的迅速增长。
    基勒里亚指出，“工业部门的迅速发展是推动今年经济增长的一个重要因素。”
    基勒里亚还对明年的经济形势作了预测。他说，明年亚太地区发展中国家的经济将继续发展，但增长速度将放慢，估计平均增长率可达６．５％。
