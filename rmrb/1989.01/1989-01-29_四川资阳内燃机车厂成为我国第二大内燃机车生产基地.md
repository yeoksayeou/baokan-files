    The Sichuan Ziyang Internal Combustion Locomotive Factory has become China's second-largest internal combustion locomotive production base. The factory now has an annual production capacity of over 100 internal combustion locomotives.

    Established in the 1960s, this "third-line" factory was listed as a national key renovation project in 1983. The Ministry of Railways invested 140 million yuan to strengthen its renovation. In recent years, the factory has accelerated its technological renovation, adhering to the principle of "combining indigenous and foreign technologies, and integrating software and hardware." It has manufactured over 13,000 sets of specialized equipment and process tools, used microcomputers and numerical control systems to renovate nearly 100 old machines, and introduced over 30 advanced foreign technologies and equipment instruments. It has gradually formed a production and processing system that integrates introduction, self-manufacturing, and renovation. The factory has also adjusted and updated its product structure according to the needs of railway transportation and the market, achieving simultaneous renovation and production.

    The factory has been able to produce locomotives while undergoing renovation, ensuring that production is not interrupted. This approach has not only improved the factory's production capacity but also enhanced its ability to meet market demands. The factory's success is a testament to the effectiveness of combining indigenous and foreign technologies and the importance of continuous renovation and innovation.

    四川资阳内燃机车厂成为我国第二大内燃机车生产基地
    该厂现已达到年产１００余台内燃机车的生产能力。
    始建于６０年代的这家“三线”工厂，１９８３年被列入国家重点改造项目，铁道部投资１．４亿元对其强化改造。几年来，这个厂加快技术改造步伐，坚持“土洋结合、软（件）硬（件）兼施”，自制专用设备和工艺装备１３０００余套，运用微机、数控改造老设备近百台，引进３０多项国外先进技术和设备仪器，逐步形成引进、自制、改造相配套的生产加工体系，还根据铁路运输和市场需要调整和更新产品结构，做到边改造，边出车。　　　　　　　　　　（刘光俊）
