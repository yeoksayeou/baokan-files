From Individual Efforts to Group Contracting—New Experiences in Agricultural Science and Technology in Hebei's Xingtai

In the spring of 1988, the Agricultural Science Institute and the Agricultural Bureau of Xingtai region in Hebei Province took the lead in forming a cotton technology contracting group consisting of 110 science and technology personnel specializing in seeds, soil and fertilizer, plant protection, and field management. This group undertook the development project of high-quality and high-yield cotton technology, covering 5 counties (cities) with a trial area of 1.15 million mu. Despite continuous rain during the flowering and boll period, which caused a general reduction in cotton yield, scientific and standardized management still resulted in a good harvest. According to the regional joint inspection and acceptance, the average yield per mu of lint cotton reached 56.1 kilograms, an increase of 11.5% over the control field, with a total increase of 675 million kilograms. The pure increase in technical economic benefits (economic benefits increased due to technology) reached over 21 million yuan.

Such technology contracting groups, which use comprehensive and matching technologies as a means, develop advantageous resources as the object, and aim to revitalize the local economy, have already formed 120 in Xingtai region. The number of science and technology personnel participating in the groups reaches over 1,500, accounting for 48% of the science and technology personnel on the production frontline; additionally, 430 local talents with technical expertise have been absorbed.

The establishment of technology contracting groups in this region began in the first half of 1987. The southern part of this region has tens of thousands of mu of sand river wasteland. After the founding of the People's Republic, there were three attempts to develop it, all of which failed due to the isolated efforts of individual departments and the lack of scientific guidance. Based on comprehensive surveys and scientific demonstrations, the Science and Technology Commission of Shahe City took the lead, gathering more than 150 science and technology personnel from 10 departments including agriculture, forestry, water, and animal husbandry, to form the Dashahe Development Technology Contracting Group in May 1987. They collaborated with universities and research institutions such as Hebei Agricultural University, leading the masses to comprehensively develop the Dashahe, achieving results in the same year. The regional committee and the administrative office promptly summarized and promoted this experience. Thus, technology contracting groups that provide comprehensive technical contracting to various industries and series technical services to thousands of households emerged like mushrooms after rain.

One year of initial practice has shown that such technology contracting groups have strong vitality:

Science and technology personnel are optimized and combined, better leveraging group advantages. After the science and technology personnel in Xingtai were liberated, a batch of well-known experts were often sought after by multiple parties, making it difficult to meet the demand. A large number of young technicians with lower visibility were rarely noticed. Relevant departments then guided them to adopt the method of "technical complementarity and new-old combination" to form technology contracting groups, further leveraging the role of various talents. The former deputy director of the Animal Husbandry Bureau of Longyao County, Senior Animal Husbandry Expert Ma Cunren, took a leave of absence to better utilize his skills. He led two animal husbandry experts, 11 assistant veterinarians, and 5 college graduates to form a reasonably structured animal husbandry technology development group, taking on the technical guidance task for the breeding of 20,000 quails, 170,000 broilers, and 200 pigs. Some were responsible for breeding, some for chick rearing, some for researching feed formulas, and some for disease prevention and control. Each technician's expertise was fully utilized.

Science and technology personnel from multiple departments and disciplines formed a new collective, generating a strong force for breakthroughs. The success of Dashahe development in quickly achieving economic benefits worth tens of millions of yuan was due to the utilization of comprehensive technical advantages. This form also facilitates the dissemination of technology. Agricultural technician Yang Jianqiu, together with 45 local talents, established a technology development contracting group. In just one year, they introduced more than ten applicable agricultural technologies to the depths of the Taihang Mountains. These technologies were then disseminated by them to the surrounding 4 counties, 5 townships, and 18 villages, helping a large number of farmers to become prosperous. Yang Jianqiu also won the national-level "Spark" outstanding youth award for technology.

Statistics show that in the past two years, these technology contracting groups have solved more than 100 key issues affecting local economic development, achieved 55 scientific and technological results, and introduced and developed 145 technologies.

It is beneficial for the reform of government institutions and the transformation of work functions. Shahe City Agricultural Bureau separated 64 technical personnel from the 82 staff members of the bureau to form a technology contracting group, which in 1988 contracted 400,000 mu of crops and developed and applied 12 new technologies. The 3 scientific research projects they completed all won provincial-level awards. The agricultural management work of the entire county was then undertaken by the 18 remaining staff. In this way, not only did the office transform from an administrative command type to a service type, improving work efficiency, but it also explored an effective path for science and technology personnel to smoothly flow to the production frontline.

The organizational forms of these technology contracting groups are diverse. Some are led by technical authorities, while others are led by local talents.

There are more than 20 technology contracting groups led by technical entities. To develop pigeon breeding, Xinhe County established the "Feiyu" type meat pigeon technology contracting group at the beginning of last year. This group, with the county science and technology commission's technical center as the "head," two meat pigeon farms and more than ten specialized households as the "body," the animal husbandry technology station and feed company as the "wings," and the frozen processing plant as the "tail," provides a series of technical services including the introduction of superior breeds, breeding, feeding, disease prevention, procurement, processing, and export.

Nearly 30 are led by the competent departments. The water-saving technology development group, composed of 20 water conservancy engineering and technical personnel from the Water Conservancy Bureau of Nangong City, forms a "one-stop" service from research and design to technical promotion and application, from material supply to management and maintenance. In two years, they installed 300 kilometers of water-saving and anti-seepage pipelines, controlling a water-saving area of over 120,000 mu.

While formulating policies to encourage the establishment of technology contracting groups by science and technology personnel, this region emphasizes the principle of mutual selection. Science and technology personnel have the autonomy to join or leave the groups. On the other hand, they pay attention to the use of the operating mechanism of matching technology with materials and funds, striving to form the best technical and economic combination and achieve the best social and economic benefits.

　　从孤军作战到集团承包
    ——河北邢台农业科技工作的新经验
    王友恭　简长春　赵武根
    河北邢台地区的科技人员“技术互补，新老结合”，组成了一个个技术承包集团。这种承包形式发挥群体优势，有许多胜过个人承包的地方
    １９８８年春季，河北省邢台地区农科所、农业局牵头，１１０名管种子、土肥、植保、田间管理的科技人员组成了棉花技术承包集团。他们承担的棉花优质丰产技术开发项目涉及５县（市），试区面积达１１５万亩。在花铃期阴雨连绵、造成棉花普遍减产的情况下，经过科学规范化管理，仍取得好收成。经地区联查验收，平均亩产皮棉达５６．１公斤，比对照田增产１１．５％，总增产６７５万公斤，纯增技术经济效益（因技术的作用而增加的经济效益）达２１００多万元。
    像这样以综合配套技术为手段、以开发优势资源为对象、以振兴地方经济为目的的技术承包集团，在邢台地区已有１２０多个。参加集团的科技人员达１５００多名，占深入生产第一线科技人员数的４８％；还吸收了有技术专长的乡土人才４３０多名。
    该地区组建技术承包集团，是从１９８７年上半年开始的。这个地区的南部有十几万亩沙河荒滩，建国后曾三次治理，均因个别部门孤军作战，缺乏科学指导，没能成功。在全面考察、科学论证的基础上，以沙河市科委牵头，集结农、林、水、牧等１０多个部门１５０多名科技人员，于１９８７年５月组成大沙河开发技术承包集团。他们外联河北农大等大专院校、科研单位，带领群众对大沙河进行综合治理，当年便获成效。地委、行署及时将这一经验加以总结推广。于是，这种向百业千厂进行综合性技术承包、为千家万户开展系列化技术服务的技术承包集团，便雨后春笋般地涌现出来。
    一年多的初步实践表明，这种技术承包集团具有强大的生命力：
    科技人员优化组合，能够更好地发挥群体优势。邢台地区放活科技人员后，一批知名度较高的专家往往被多家争相聘请，难以应求。一大批知名度较低的青年技术人员，则很少有人问津。有关部门便引导他们采取“技术互补，新老结合”的办法，组建技术承包集团，进一步发挥各类人才的作用。隆尧县原畜牧局副局长、高级畜牧师马存仁停薪留职后，为了更好地发挥作用，带领两名畜牧师、１１名助理兽医师和５名大中专毕业生，组成一个人员结构比较合理的畜牧技术开发集团，承包了２万只鹌鹑、１７万只肉鸡和２００头猪的饲养技术指导任务。他们有的负责引种，有的负责育雏，有的研究饲料配方，有的搞防疫灭病，每个技术人员的专长都得到比较充分的发挥。
    多部门、多学科的科技人员形成新的集体，产生强大的攻坚合力。大沙河开发之所以能够很快取得价值上千万元的经济效益，就是因为发挥了综合技术优势。这种形式还有利于技术的扩散，农艺师杨建秋团结４５名乡土人才建立的技术开发承包集团，在短短一年的时间里引进十几项农业适用技术到太行山深处。这些技术，又通过他们扩散到周围４县５乡１８个村，使一大批农民脱贫致富。杨建秋也因而获得国家级“星火”技术优秀青年奖。
    据统计，近两年来，这些技术承包集团解决了影响当地经济发展的关键课题１００多个，取得科技成果５５项，引进开发技术１４５项。
    有利于政府机构的改革，转变工作职能。沙河市农业局从局机关８２名干部中，分离出６４名技术人员组成技术承包集团，１９８８年承包了４０万亩农作物，开发应用了１２项新技术。他们完成的３个科研项目均获省级成果奖。全县的农业管理工作，则由１８名留下来的干部承担。这样，不仅使机关由行政指挥型向服务型转变，提高了工作效率，还为科技人员顺畅流向生产第一线探索出一条有效途径。
    这些技术承包集团的组织形式是多种多样的。有的由技术权威牵头组建，有的由乡土人才牵头组建。
    以技术实体牵头的技术承包集团有２０多个。为了发展养鸽，新河县去年初建起了“飞鸟”型肉鸽技术承包集团。这个集团以县科委技术中心为“鸟头”，以两个肉鸽场和十多个专业大户为“鸟身”，以畜牧技术站和饲料公司为“两翼”，以冷冻加工厂为“鸟尾”，进行优种引进、繁育、饲养、防疫、收购、加工、出口系列化技术服务。
    主管部门牵头组建的近３０个。由南宫市水利局２０名水利工程技术人员组成的节水技术开发集团，从研究设计到技术推广应用、从物资供应到管理维修形成“一条龙”，两年安装节水防渗管道３００多公里，节水控制面积达１２万多亩。
    这个地区在制定鼓励政策、促进科技人员组建技术承包集团的同时，强调双向选择原则，科技人员拥有进出集团的自主权。另一方面，他们注意运用技术和物资、资金配套的运行机制，力求形成最佳技术经济组合，获取最佳社会经济效益。
