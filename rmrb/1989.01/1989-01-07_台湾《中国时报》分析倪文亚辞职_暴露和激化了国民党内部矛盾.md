Taiwan's *China Times* recently published an article stating that the resignation of Taiwan's "Legislative Yuan President" Ni Wen-ya has exposed and intensified internal conflicts within the Kuomintang (KMT).

The article states that the KMT is currently facing a complex political situation, which has been further complicated by the unexpected resignation of Ni Wen-ya. This has posed an early challenge to the party's structural transformation. In summary, there are several key issues:

1. KMT Chairman Lee Teng-hui has been in power for less than a year, and the party's decision-making structure urgently needs stability and unity. However, Ni Wen-ya, as a core figure within the party, has presented Lee with a difficult problem, affecting Lee's "leadership authority."

2. Within the "Legislative Yuan," the contradictions between old and new factions have become increasingly apparent. The resignation of Ni Wen-ya has prematurely exposed the personnel conflicts in the selection of the new and deputy presidents of the "Legislative Yuan," making the already chaotic situation within the KMT's "Legislative Yuan" party branch even more unpredictable. This has caused harm to the stability of the KMT's governance.

3. Major reform bills initiated by Chiang Ching-kuo during his lifetime are currently being legislated in the "Legislative Yuan." The resignation incident has delayed legislative proceedings, further disrupting the order of the "Legislative Yuan," making it even more difficult to pass these bills, and affecting the KMT's overall strategic plan for political reform.

4. The "Legislative Yuan" is the main arena for political struggles between the KMT and the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). The resignation of Ni Wen-ya has exposed internal conflicts within the KMT, reducing the party's ability to resist. On the other hand, it has allowed the DPP to exploit the incident, using the "elevation of Ni Wen-ya" to "diminish the KMT."

The article states that Ni Wen-ya, in the current chaotic situation of the "Legislative Yuan," has faced various pressures from multiple directions. He has not only been obstructed and interfered with by DPP legislators but has also been questioned and protested by KMT legislators. Therefore, Ni Wen-ya's fatigue and helplessness, and even occasional outbursts of emotion, are understandable. However, Ni Wen-ya, who has been involved in politics for 50 years, has experienced many storms and should have a high level of adaptability and resilience. This resignation incident is difficult to fully comprehend.

The article points out that some people believe that Ni Wen-ya's resignation is related to the transformation of the KMT's governance. Ni Wen-ya was a key aide to two generations of the Chiang family, and in the current "Lee Teng-hui system," his political psychology is difficult to adjust. This situation is evident in the fact that, despite Lee Teng-hui's two summons and the continuous dispatch of high-ranking officials to persuade him to stay, Ni Wen-ya still went to Cihu and Dashe to pay his respects at the tombs, which shows his mindset.

The article believes that from the perspective of Ni Wen-ya's resignation, internal conflicts within the KMT have already reached the party's decision-making core. The difficulty of reorganizing the new order within the KMT is directly proportional to the external pressures. The continuous and increasingly intense challenges from the outside will lead to even more unpredictable internal conflicts within the KMT.

　　台湾《中国时报》分析倪文亚辞职
    暴露和激化了国民党内部矛盾
    新华社北京１月６日电  台湾《中国时报》日前刊登文章说，台湾“立法院院长”倪文亚辞职一事，暴露和激化了国民党内部的矛盾。
    文章说，国民党目前面对的整个政治难局，经倪文亚辞职事件的意外介入，可谓乱上加乱，提前遭到自我转变结构的难题挑战。概略而言，大致有几大方面：一，国民党主席李登辉初掌政权未及一年，党政决策结构最需安定团结，而倪文亚以党内元老的核心角色地位，给予李登辉出此难题，影响了李登辉的“领导权威”。二，台湾“立法院”内，新旧矛盾激化的迹象已经甚为明显。而倪氏之辞职风波，提前暴露“立法院”未来正副“院长”人事的产生矛盾，使国民党“立法院”党部已混乱不堪的局面，横生变数，“对国民党政权的稳定造成伤害”。三，蒋经国生前的“政治改革”的重大法案，正在“立法院”力求落实立法的艰辛过程中，辞职事件延宕了立法议事时间，进一步混乱了“立法院”的秩序，使得这些法案的通过立法难上加难，影响了国民党“政治改革的全局战略规划”。四，“立法院”是国民党与民进党进行政治抗争的主要场所。倪氏辞职事件，一方面暴露了国民党内部矛盾，降低了国民党的抗争能力，另一方面让民进党将辞职事件扩大化，以“高捧倪文亚”来“贬低国民党”。
    文章说，倪文亚在现阶段“立法院”乱局里担当议事主导，遭到来自多方面的各种压力，不仅备受民进党“立委”杯葛、干扰，而且遭到国民党籍“立委”的质疑与抗议。因此，倪氏之倦勤与无奈，甚至偶然带有意气，应为人情之常。但是，倪文亚“翻腾政坛”５０年，早已经风雨、见世面，“应具有较高较强的圆融韧性”，此次辞职事件，终难令人完全理解。
    文章指出，有人认为倪文亚的辞职与国民党政权的转化有着牵连关系。倪文亚是蒋氏两代的“辅佐重臣”，而在当前“李登辉体制下”，其政治心理难以调适。此种情形，证诸于李登辉两度召见，且持续派遣大员予以慰留的情况下，倪氏恰在其时仍前往慈湖、大溪谒陵，即可见其一斑。
    文章认为，从倪文亚辞职事件看来，国民党内部矛盾已经进入了国民党的决策核心。而国民党内部新秩序的重整难易恰与外界的压力成正比。外界持续不断、益加凌厉的挑战，形将导致国民党内部更加不可测的矛盾互动。
