To the Editor:

In the December 31, 1988, editorial article "Effective Measures to Promote the Development of Commodity Economy," there are some provisions from the Standardization Law that were cited. I noticed that there are significant discrepancies with the "Standardization Law of the People's Republic of China" published on the same day. Could you please explain the reason for this?

A Reader

Editor's Note: The issue raised by this reader does exist. This commentary was written based on the discussion draft of the Standardization Law. However, when the National People's Congress Standing Committee approved this law, it made some modifications. Due to an oversight in our work, we did not revise the commentary according to the official text when publishing it, resulting in errors. Therefore, the officially approved "Standardization Law of the People's Republic of China" should be taken as the standard, and we apologize to the readers.

    编辑同志：
    贵报１９８８年１２月３１日评论员文章《促进商品经济发展的有力措施》，引用了标准化法的一些条文，我发现与同日公布的《中华人民共和国标准化法》有较大出入，不知是何原因？
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　——一读者
    编者的话：这位读者指出的问题确实存在。此篇评论是根据标准化法讨论文本撰写的，而全国人大常委会批准此法时又作了修改，我们在发表此篇评论时，由于工作上的疏漏，没有根据正式文本再加以校正，故发生错误。因此，应以正式批准的《中华人民共和国标准化法》为准，并向读者致歉。
