Now, Shanghai residents have more carp, crucian carp, and grass carp in their baskets. Last year, the per capita consumption of freshwater fish reached 6.9 kilograms, an increase of 3.6 times compared to three years ago, ranking among the top in the country.

This is a result of the "Shanghai Suburban Pond Aquaculture High-Yield Technology Comprehensive Trial Project." This project has been implemented for three years, with a trial pond area of over 13,000 mu, cumulatively increasing freshwater fish production by 8.4 million kilograms, with a new output value of over 21 million yuan. The yield per mu has increased from the original 322 kilograms to 585 kilograms. Among these, the production of carp, crucian carp, and grass carp, which are popular among Shanghai residents, accounts for 59% of the total production.

This project, undertaken by Shanghai Fisheries University and the Shanghai Fisheries Bureau, along with more than ten other units, utilizes the principles of systems engineering. With the goal of improving the overall production capacity of fish ponds, it fully utilizes pond aquaculture mixed-stocking and intensive farming technologies. By focusing on key technologies such as water quality, fish species, feed, and management, it achieves high yield, high quality, low consumption, and high efficiency, initially exploring a comprehensive technological model for large-scale high-yield aquaculture.

This project has changed the previous supporting role of freshwater fish in the aquatic product market. Shanghai's total freshwater fish production has increased from over 20,000 tons four years ago to nearly 90,000 tons now, with the proportion of freshwater fish in the city's total aquatic product production increasing from 14.9% to 35.1%.

The increase in freshwater fish yield indirectly saves a large amount of pond excavation funds and land. Based on the city's average yield of 397 kilograms per mu in 1987, the increased part is equivalent to excavating 38,500 mu of intensive fish ponds; with an investment of 2,000 yuan per mu, this is equivalent to saving 77 million yuan in pond excavation funds.

　　一项养鱼新技术丰富了市民菜篮子
    上海市场供鱼量成倍增加
    新华社上海１月１３日电  （中国新闻学院实习生厉正宏、陈建山）现在，上海市民菜篮子里的鲫鱼、鳊鱼、草鱼等淡水鱼越来越多了，去年人均淡水鱼的占有量已达６．９公斤，比３年前增加了３．６倍，在全国名列前茅。
    这是“上海市郊区池塘养鱼高产技术大面积综合试验项目”带来的可喜变化。这一试验项目迄今已实施３年，试验池塘面积达１．３万多亩，累计增产淡水鱼８４０多万公斤，新增产值２１００余万元。亩产也从原来的３２２公斤提高到５８５公斤。其中，上海市民喜食的鲫鱼、鳊鱼、草鱼产量已占总产量的５９％。
    由上海水产大学和上海水产局等十几个单位协作承担的这一项目，利用系统工程的科学原理，以提高鱼池整体生产能力为目标，充分运用池塘养鱼混放、密养技术，抓住水质、鱼种、饵料、管理等主要技术关键，达到高产、优质、低消耗、高效益的目的，初步摸索出了一套大面积高产养鱼的综合技术模式。
    这个项目改变了以往淡水鱼在水产品市场中的配角地位。上海市的淡水鱼总产量已从４年前的２万多吨提高到现在的近９万吨，淡水鱼占全市水产品总产量的比重已从１４．９％提高到３５．１％。
    淡水鱼单产的提高，间接节省了大量开塘资金和土地，以１９８７年全市平均亩产３９７公斤计算，增产的部分相当于新开挖了３．８５万亩精养鱼塘；每亩鱼塘以投资２０００元计，相当于节省７７００万元开塘资金。
