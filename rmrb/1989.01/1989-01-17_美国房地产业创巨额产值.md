The National Association of Realtors in the United States recently released a research report stating that the real estate industry generates approximately one-quarter of the U.S. gross national product.

The report indicates that in 1987, the U.S. real estate industry contributed $1.1 trillion to the gross national product, accounting for 23.5% of the national total. In 1980, this proportion was 22%, and in 1947, it was only 15%.

The largest sector within the U.S. real estate industry is the service sector, which in 1987 had an estimated income of $519 billion.
