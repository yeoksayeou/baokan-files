	New York stock prices and the dollar exchange rate both fell today, the first trading day of 1989 for the New York stock and foreign exchange markets.

	At the close of trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average stood at 2144.64 points, down 23.93 points from the last trading day of 1988. The dollar's closing rate against the yen fell from 1:124.95 on the last trading day of 1988 (December 30) to 1:123.825, and its rate against the West German mark also fell from 1:1.7770 to 1:1.7670.

	Financial analysts here believe that the poor opening of the New York stock market was mainly due to traders' concerns over the rise in U.S. interest rates. Many analysts believe that the dollar's exchange rate will continue to decline this year, with some predicting that by mid-year, the dollar's rates against the yen and the West German mark will fall to 1:110 and 1:1.60, respectively. Others predict that the dollar's rates against the yen and the West German mark will fluctuate around 1:120 and 1:1.70, respectively, throughout the year.

　　纽约股票和美元汇价下跌
    新华社纽约１月３日电  今天是纽约股票和外汇市场１９８９年的第一个交易日，股票价格和美元汇价都告下跌。
    到收盘时，道·琼斯３０种工业股票平均指数为２１４４．６４点，比去年最后一个交易日收盘价下跌２３．９３点；美元对日元的收盘比价由去年最后一个交易日（３０日）的１∶１２４．９５降到１∶１２３．８２５，对西德马克的比价也由１∶１．７７７０降到１．７６７０。
    此间金融分析家认为，纽约股市开市不利，主要因为交易者担心美国的利率上升。很多分析家认为，在今年内美元汇价将继续下滑，其中有些人预计，到今年年中，美元同日元和西德马克的比价将分别跌至１比１１０和１比１．６０，另一些人预计，在今年内美元同日元和西德马克的比价将在１比１２０和１比１．７０上下波动。
