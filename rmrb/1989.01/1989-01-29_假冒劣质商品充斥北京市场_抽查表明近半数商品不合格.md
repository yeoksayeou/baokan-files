Fake and substandard goods are flooding the Beijing market. According to the arrangement by the State Bureau of Technical Supervision, the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Standards and Metrology, in collaboration with relevant departments, recently conducted an inspection of 16 types of canned goods, grains and oils, white liquor, colored liquor, and electric blankets. Out of 123 samples, only 71 were qualified, with a qualification rate of just 57.7%.

The 42 samples of canned goods in glass jars that were inspected were found to have basic hygiene standards, but issues such as insufficient net weight and poor taste were severe, with a qualification rate of only about 20%. The best-quality canned goods were sugar-water tangerines from the Guangxi State-owned Huashan Canned Food Factory, while the worst were bamboo shoots from the Yunnan Zhaotong Canned Food Factory.

The problems with liquor are serious. The samples of Xifeng, Fenjiu, and Wuliangye taken from Dongdan Market, Tongxian Huilong Store, and Jingsong Department Store were all found to be counterfeit.

Electric blankets are essential winter heating items for many people, but out of the 15 sets of samples inspected, only 3 sets were fully qualified. Additionally, the Guangming brand from the Beijing Changping Great Wall Electrical Appliance Factory and the Chunyan brand from the Beijing Dongyuanjiao Town Erjie Chunyan Electric Blanket Factory did not even have quality certificates, yet their products were still being sold in the market.

A total of 52 batches of grains and oils, including japonica rice, standard flour, soybean oil, peanut oil, rapeseed oil, and sesame oil, were inspected, with 45 batches qualifying, resulting in a qualification rate of 86.5%. Issues discovered included flour processing precision not meeting standards and excessive acid values and solvent residues in edible oils.

The Beijing Municipal Bureau of Standards and Metrology has sealed and stopped the sale of the counterfeit and substandard products that were found.

　　假冒劣质商品充斥北京市场  抽查表明近半数商品不合格
    据新华社北京１月２８日电（记者姜在忠）根据国家技术监督局的部署，近日北京市标准计量局会同有关部门，对市场上的罐头、粮油、白酒、色酒、电热毯５类１６种商品进行了抽查，抽取的１２３个样品中，合格样品只有７１个，合格率仅５７．７％。
    这次抽查的玻璃瓶装罐头共４２个样品，经化验其卫生指标基本合格，但净重不够、口感不佳等情况严重，合格率仅为２０％左右。质量最好的罐头是广西国营华山罐头厂的糖水桔子，质量最差的，是云南昭通罐头厂的罗汉笋罐头。
    白酒类的问题严重。由东单菜市场、通县惠龙商店、劲松百货商场抽到的西凤、汾酒、五粮液，经检验全是假冒货。
    电热毯是很多人冬季少不了的取暖物品，然而抽查的１５组样品中，只有３组全部合格。此外，北京昌平长城电器厂的光明牌、北京东燕郊镇二街春燕电褥厂的春燕牌电热毯，根本没拿到质量合格证，产品却在市场上销售。
    粮油食品共抽取了籼米、标准粉、大豆油、花生油、菜籽油、香油６个品种，共计５２个批次，合格４５个批次，抽查合格率为８６．５％。发现的问题是面粉加工精度不合格，食油中酸值和溶剂残留量超标等。
    北京市标准计量局对查出的假冒、劣质产品已经封存，停止销售。
