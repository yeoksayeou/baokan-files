The Canadian military spokesman announced that a cruise missile test originally scheduled for today near Edmonton, Canada, by the United States has been postponed for 48 hours due to thick fog at the Alaskan Air Force base.

This test differs from the previous eight cruise missile tests conducted by the United States in Canada, as the two countries will cooperate in a simulated air interception of the missile. However, the early warning aircraft and the refueling aircraft for the B-52 bomber carrying the missile were unable to take off from the Alaskan Air Force base as planned due to the fog, necessitating the postponement of the test.

　　美推迟在加拿大的巡航导弹试验
    新华社渥太华１月２４日电  加拿大军方发言人宣布，美国原定今天在加拿大埃德蒙顿附近进行的一次巡航导弹试验因为阿拉斯加空军基地出现大雾而推迟４８小时。
    这次试验与美国在加拿大进行的前８次巡航导弹试验不同，两国将合作进行模拟空中摧毁导弹试验。但预警飞机和为携带导弹的Ｂ—５２型轰炸机加油的飞机因为大雾无法按原计划从阿拉斯加空军基地起飞，试验只能推迟。
