In front of the most precious commodity
	— A Record of People Queuing in Front of the Grey Building in Beihai to Buy Gold Jewelry

	People's Daily reporter Wei Yanan

	In Beijing's Beihai, the crystal-clear ice surface has people skating on it. Nearby, there is an unassuming grey building with windows covered in paper. From early morning to late evening, people are always queuing outside, patiently, eagerly, and persistently waiting in the cold wind. Only when you get closer do you realize that they are buying the world's most precious commodity—gold jewelry. It is said that it has been sold for over a month now.

	I curiously observed this queue of people buying gold jewelry. There were elderly people and young people, some dressed in a rustic manner and others in elegant attire. It was evident that most of them were in pairs; after all, this is a significant expenditure, so elderly couples, young married couples, and lovers naturally come together. I joined their ranks to listen to their conversations.

	"In a better place, why choose such a rundown place to sell such precious items, deliberately making people suffer." A fashionable woman, while pulling up the collar of her down jacket to keep warm, complained.

	"Stores and hotels are nice, but how many can you actually buy from?" An elderly woman with white hair replied.

	"Has it been sold outside? Where? I've never come across it." Someone curiously asked, obviously regretting not being able to buy it before.

	"This thing has been on the market for at least five or six years. I've seen it sold in jewelry stores on the street. At that time, 1 gram cost only 60-70 yuan. Now it's 145 yuan and it's still hard to buy. It's a shame I didn't think of it then, to be honest, I didn't have that much money. In the old society, people valued wearing gold and silver, but after the founding of the nation, no one cared. During the Cultural Revolution, it was even worse; gold and silver jewelry was practically a sin. That's why when gold jewelry first hit the market, no one paid attention. Who would have thought it would become this popular?" An elderly worker sighed with emotion.

	"Don't even mention it. A few months ago, the price in stores was already over 130 yuan per gram, and it was sold with various pendants. A 10-gram, 24K gold necklace with a jade pendant cost 2000 yuan. This is called 'not enough gold, jade makes up the difference.' Even so, it was quickly sold out." Someone added.

	"Now, stores don't have any stock, and buying gold jewelry still requires connections. It is said that in the past ten years, the national gold production has increased by one and a half times, accumulating more than the total production of 30 years. There are more than 20 counties with ten thousand taels of gold, and even more individual gold miners. Who knows where all this gold has gone?" A person who seemed to be an official interjected.

	"There are many individuals selling gold jewelry, but who dares to buy without knowing if it's genuine? My neighbor urgently needed to buy jewelry for his son's wedding and spent over a thousand yuan on two rings. When he took them to a gold store to verify, they turned out to be fake. He didn't even have time to cry." "Our factory sold rings, wrapped in envelopes. Whoever wanted them paid the money. I didn't dare to buy." Two people chimed in, expressing their confusion over the chaotic market of gold jewelry.

	"How can you tell if it's genuine or not, and how can you tell the quality?" Two young girls asked the people around them for advice. "It's not easy to tell. I only know that the brighter and more golden it is, the better. If it's reddish, it's not pure. I've heard that real gold tastes sweet when licked, but I've never tried it." Someone replied, while others remained silent, seemingly unfamiliar with gold to these eager pursuers.

	"Will the gold sold here be genuine?" Someone voiced their concern.

	"Gold sold with official receipts can't be fake."

	People asked, answered, and discussed, slowly moving forward.

	Indeed, buying gold jewelry is not easy. However, even this difficulty is not something everyone can overcome. Everyone in the queue held a small ticket with the words and stamp of the Eleventh Asian Games Service Company. They were buying according to the time and place on the purchase ticket. It is said that this is a specially approved project to raise funds for the Asian Games.

	A lucky person who won a ticket in a draw at their workplace said: "In our place, out of hundreds of people, only four tickets were issued. I was lucky to get one, but I was afraid it would be wasted, so I've come here twice. The first time I came late and didn't buy anything. Today, I got up early, but I still didn't get to the front. I don't know if I can buy it in the morning."

	"People are strange, their pursuits have no end. Just after rushing to buy washing machines, color TVs, and refrigerators, they are now eager to buy gold jewelry." Someone seemed to be complaining.

	"If it weren't for having bought everything necessary, who would buy this thing? These days, prices are unpredictable, saving money is foolish, but buying gold jewelry will never depreciate." The buyer's frank words prompted an elderly woman next to her to say: "I don't have many days left to live. I want to buy a ring to wear and enjoy myself. If I don't buy it now, the price will go up again!"

	The intense gold jewelry craze and the rising gold prices made the people buying gold jewelry forget the cold of the wind and snow. It seems they have made up their minds to buy the gold jewelry at any cost!

### 在最贵重的商品面前——记在北海灰房子前排队买金饰品的人们

　　在最贵重的商品面前
    ——记在北海灰房子前排队买金饰品的人们
    本报记者  魏亚南
    北京的北海，晶莹的冰面上有人在滑冰。附近有一栋不起眼的灰房子，窗玻璃用纸糊着，门外每天从早到晚都有人排队，在寒风里等得那么耐心、热烈、执著。来到近前才晓得，原来他们在购买世界上最贵重的商品——黄金饰品。据说，已经卖了一个多月了。
    我好奇地打量着这支买金饰品的队伍，其中有年老的，也有年轻的，有土里土气的，也有穿着讲究的。看得出，大都是成双成对地排在那里；因为这毕竟是一次大的花销，老两口、小夫妻、情侣们自然要同时到场了。加入他们的行列里，听听他们议论些什么？
    “在哪儿不好，偏找这么个土鳖地方卖这么贵重的东西，成心叫人受罪。”一位打扮入时的妇女一边把羽绒外套领子立起来御寒，一边发牢骚。
    “商店、宾馆漂亮，可有几个能买得到！”一位头发花白的妇女接着说。
    “外边卖过吗？在哪儿？我怎么没遇到过？”有人好奇地搭讪，显然是为过去求购不得而惋惜。
    “这玩艺儿在市场上露面，少说也有五六年了，我就见到街里珠宝店里卖过，那时１克才６０多元。现在可好，１４５元还难买呢。只怪当时没这个想头，说实在的也没那么多钱。旧社会有人讲究穿金戴银，建国后就没人当回事了，“文革”期间更甭说，金银首饰简直就是罪孽，要不金饰品刚上市时怎么会没人理会呢？想不到现在热到这份儿上。”一位退休工人模样的人颇有感慨。
    “还说呢，前两个月商店里的价钱就已经１３０多元１克了，还是配上各类挂件一起出售的。１条１０克左右的２４Ｋ金项链，带一只翡翠挂件，标价２０００元。这叫‘金不够，玉来凑’。就这样，不大一会儿一抢而光。”有人补充道。
    “现在商店里根本无货，买金饰品还得走后门。听说，十年来国家黄金产量增长了一倍半，累积比３０年总产量还多，光万两黄金县就有２０多个，个体采金的更多，也不知这么多黄金都哪去了？”一个像是干部的人插话。
    “个人卖金首饰的不少，不知真假谁敢买。我那邻居急着为儿子办喜事，花了上千元买了两只戒指，到金店花钱一验是假的，哭都来不及了。”“我们厂卖过戒指，就装在信封里，谁要谁掏钱，我是没敢买。”两个人一唱一合，对鱼目混珠、销售混乱的金饰品市场感到困惑。
    “怎么能分出真假，看出成色的好坏来？”两位年轻姑娘向周围人求教。“不大好鉴别。我只知道黄澄澄闪亮的好，发红的不纯。听说真金用嘴舔有甜味，但没试过。”一人回答，其他的闷不作声，看来金子对这些热心追求者还是陌生的。
    “也不知道这儿卖的会不会有假？”不知是谁发出了担忧的声音。
    “公家发票卖的总假不了。”
    人们问着，答着，议论着，慢慢往前挪。
    确实，买金饰品不易。然而，就是这不易，也并不是所有的人都能得到的。凡是站队的人，手里都攥着一张小票，上面印有第十一届亚运会服务公司的字样和戳子，他们是按着购买券上的时间和地点，到此购买的。据说，这是为亚运会工程筹资特许的经营项目。
    一位在单位里抓阄得到这张小票的幸运者说：“我们那里上百人才发４张票，好不容易抓到的票，我怕废了，已经来过两次了。第一次晚来没有买上，今天起了个大早，还是没挨上头一名，不知上午能不能买上。”
    “要说人也怪，追求没个止境。刚刚抢着把洗衣机、彩电、电冰箱买齐了，又兴起来买金首饰热。”有人像是自怨自艾。
    “要不是该买的都买了，谁买这玩艺。这年头物价没个谱，攒钱是傻瓜，买了金饰品啥时候也不贬值。”这位买主坦率的话，引出了旁边一位老太太的话：“我没几天活头了，买只戒指戴戴，过过瘾。有卖的不买，往后又该涨价了！”
    炽烈的金饰品热，递增的黄金价，使买金饰品的人们忘记了风雪的寒冷。看来他们是打定主意，非把金饰品买到手不可了！
