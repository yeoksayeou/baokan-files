	Stocks are different from bonds that can be redeemed with interest at maturity; they are securities that represent permanent equity. So, if residents hold such securities without a maturity date and need to convert them into cash, what should they do? Here, we invite a colleague from the People's Bank of China to introduce this issue that readers are concerned about.

		— Editor

	If a stockholder urgently needs cash or wants to convert stocks into other securities, they can sell the stocks on the stock market. This buying and selling activity is called stock trading.

	Stock trading can be organized in two forms: exchange trading and over-the-counter (OTC) trading. A stock exchange is a highly organized stock market composed of member companies or limited companies that specialize in acting as agents for investors to buy and sell stocks. Its function is to provide a centralized venue and facilities for member companies to conduct stock trading. Currently, China does not have such economic organizations.

	OTC trading is conducted by many securities companies acting as intermediaries for stock transfers. During trading, securities companies generally buy stocks at a slightly lower price (called the bid price) and sell stocks at a slightly higher price (called the ask price). The difference between the bid price and the ask price is the operating income of the securities company.

	Currently, China has approved the establishment of more than 30 securities companies. In 1987, Shanghai issued the first national "Temporary Regulations on OTC Securities Trading," establishing 10 OTC trading network points and agency points to handle various securities trading agency and self-operated buying and selling businesses. Among these, the stock trading volume reached approximately 2 million yuan.

	The procedures and methods for stock buying and selling differ depending on the organizational form. Currently, China only has OTC trading, so stock buying and selling generally adopts a negotiated pricing method, commonly known as haggling. If an investor entrusts a securities company to act as an agent for buying and selling stocks, the accepting securities company must repeatedly examine the provided buying or selling prices to find the most favorable price for the transaction. If an investor buys and sells stocks themselves, they can negotiate directly with the securities company to complete the transaction.

	After the stock buying and selling parties reach an agreement, they must complete the stock delivery process, i.e., the buying party pays the amount and receives the stocks, and the selling party hands over the stocks and receives the amount. After the stock delivery, the new stockholder must go to the company that issued the stocks or the financial institution that acts as the agent for issuing stocks to "transfer the ownership," i.e., handle the name change formalities. Only then can they become a shareholder and enjoy shareholder rights.

	Currently, China's shareholding system is just being piloted, and the issued stocks are mainly for internal fundraising or are irregular stocks. There are very few stocks that truly meet the requirements for listing and trading, and the trading volume is very limited. The trading system is also not perfect. However, with the deepening of the reform, stock trading activities will expand and improve along with the development of enterprise shareholding.

### 股票的交易

　　股票的交易
    股票与到期可还本付息的债券不同，是具有永久性特征的股权证券。那么居民持有这种无期限的有价证券后，如急需把它变成现金时，该怎么办？在此请中国人民银行的同志就这个读者关心的问题作一些介绍。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　——编者
    股票持有人如果急用现金或转化成其他证券，可将股票拿到股票市场上出售，这种买卖活动叫作股票交易。
    股票交易的组织形式有交易所交易和场外交易（即柜台交易）之分。证券交易所是高度组织化的股票市场，是由一些专门代理投资人买卖股票的经纪人公司、证券公司所组成的会员制组织或有限公司组织。其功能是为交易所成员提供集中进行股票交易的场所和设施。就我国目前情况而言，尚没有这样的经济组织。
    柜台交易是以很多家证券公司各自作为转让中介进行的股票交易活动。在交易时，证券公司一般以略低的价格（称买入价）买进股票，以略高的价格（称卖出价）卖出股票。买入价与卖出价的差额，是证券公司的经营收入。
    目前我国已批准成立了３０多家证券公司。１９８７年上海颁布了全国第一个《证券柜台交易暂行规定》，设立了１０个证券柜台交易网点和代办点，办理各种有价证券交易的委托代理和自营买卖业务，其中股票交易额达２００万元左右。
    股票交易程序和买卖方式因其组织形式不同而有所不同。目前我国仅有柜台交易一种形式，故股票买卖一般采用议价方式，俗称讨价还价。若投资者委托证券公司代理买卖股票，接受委托的证券公司就要反复考察所提供的买价或卖价，寻找最有利的价格成交。若投资者自己买卖股票，则可以与证券公司直接议价成交。
    股票买卖双方成交后，须履行股票交割手续，即买入方付出款项收到股票，卖出方交出股票收到款项。股票交割后，新的股票持有人还必须到发行股票的公司或代理发行股票的金融机构去“过户”，即办理更名事宜，这样才能成为股东，享受股东权益。
    目前我国股份制刚刚试行，已发行的股票主要是内部集资，或不规范的股票。真正符合上市交易的股票非常少，交易量很有限，交易制度尚不完善。但随着改革的深入，股票交易活动将会随企业股份化的发展而扩大和完善。
