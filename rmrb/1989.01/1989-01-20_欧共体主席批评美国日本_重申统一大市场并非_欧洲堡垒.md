European Community President Criticizes the United States and Japan, Reiterates that the Unified Market is Not a "European Fortress"

New China News Agency Paris, January 17

Strasbourg News: European Community Commission President Jacques Delors today criticized the United States and Japan, saying that they hope to see a "submissive, politically weak Europe."

Delors, in a speech to the European Parliament, criticized the view prevalent in the United States and Japan that the construction of a unified internal market in the Community is a "European fortress." According to Agence France-Presse, Delors pointed out in his speech, "Because Europe is showing its vitality and is being coveted, some people have hastily depicted us as building high walls and towers." He criticized "those who themselves pass protectionist trade laws or, under various pretexts, hesitate to open their own markets."

The President called on the member states of the European Community to strengthen political cooperation, so that the Community can play a role on the international stage commensurate with its economic strength. He believes that if Europe makes progress in the economy but hesitates in foreign policy, "it will lead to a decline in our vitality."

　　欧共体主席批评美国日本
　　重申统一大市场并非“欧洲堡垒”
    新华社巴黎１月１７日电  斯特拉斯堡消息：欧洲共同体委员会主席雅克·德洛尔今天指责美国和日本，说它们希望出现一个“逆来顺受、缺乏政治意志的欧洲”。
    德洛尔在欧洲议会发表讲话时，抨击了“在美国或日本广为流行”的把建设中的共同体内部统一大市场说成是“欧洲堡垒”的言论。据法新社报道，德洛尔在讲话中指出，“由于欧洲正表现出其活力”并“为人所垂涎”，“有人就断然把我们描绘成正在竖起高墙坚塔”。他批评了“那些自己表决通过保护主义的贸易法或在种种幌子下放慢自己市场畏畏缩缩开放的人”。
    这位主席呼吁欧洲共同体各成员国加强政治合作，以使共同体在国际舞台上发挥与其经济实力相称的影响。他认为，如果欧洲在经济上取得进步而在外交政策上却犹豫不决：“那就会导致我们的活力减退”。
