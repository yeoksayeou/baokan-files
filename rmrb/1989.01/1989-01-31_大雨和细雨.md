Heavy Rain and Light Rain

It seems as if parched land yearns for a soaking rain. Over a hundred cartoonists, with laughter from their pens, have poured a timely rain on the hardened, frozen soil of ignorance and superstition. It has been too long! Good rain!

In recent years, we have been busy with economic reforms, focusing on developing socialist commodity economics, and busy saying goodbye to poverty. We have forgotten to say goodbye to ignorance. Feudal superstition is no longer a forgotten corner but a vast forgotten wasteland, losing its human green and almost becoming a ghostly realm.

The improvement of the scientific and cultural quality of the entire population is not something that can be achieved with just a few heavy rains. Lenin and Mao Zedong emphasized the importance of "seriously educating the peasants." In today's reforming China, this feels more urgent and profound! Our country has over 800 million peasants and 230 million illiterates. In the world's total number of illiterates, China accounts for a quarter. This is the largest breeding ground for ignorance.

The ten years of the Cultural Revolution was a great political ignorance, involving hundreds of millions of people, and was a modern superstition—idol worship. If we do not work hard to improve the scientific and cultural quality of the entire population and do not pay attention to education, then ignorance can appear in new forms—ghost worship! With the living savior gone, one must seek new saviors—gods and ghosts. In fact, the roots of these two kinds of ignorance are the same: feudalism. The former wears a "revolutionary" coat, while the latter wears a divine robe. Hegel's words are good: examples of giving up one's personality are slavery, and giving up the rationality of reason is manifested as superstition (Philosophy of Right, p. 74). Feudalism, however, is precisely contemptuous of personality and does not value reason.

In some places, ancestral tomb disputes have led to clan conflicts, deforestation, grave digging, and large-scale armed fights. In some places, troupes and percussion bands are hired, with guns and banners, to hold large-scale ancestral worship demonstrations (including county-level party cadres leading the way). Isn't this the manifestation of feudal thoughts such as bloodline theory, birth status, and ancestor worship? In some tourist and entertainment venues, children wear long gowns, fake braids, and bottle caps, which are not reflections of adults' feudal bad tastes? A computer factory in the south holds large-scale computer fortune-telling activities in the factory, and a cement factory in a certain city, due to two workers being burned, does not investigate the cause of the accident but holds large-scale incense-burning and god-seeking activities. Doesn't this also show that feudal thoughts have a large foothold among some workers?

What is particularly alarming is that several large and medium-sized cities have simultaneously launched large-scale "celebrating the second Dragon Year" activities. According to my memory of reading the news, there are Changchun and Benxi in the Northeast, Taiyuan in North China, and Gejiu in Southwest China. Those days, the city's firecracker inventory was sold out, from midnight to dawn, firecrackers filled the sky, and firecracker debris covered the ground, making some foreign tourists think: the Chinese have gone mad! It's not a festival, not a celebration, why so crazy! Especially ridiculous is that all the peach cans are sold out, absurdly reaching the level of old society's alleyway aunts' superstitions about homophones: escape (peach) disasters! Escape (peach) difficulties! The scale and level of this ignorance are probably beyond what Lu Xun's Ru Town can imagine! Based on the strange phenomena witnessed, the following five "transformations" were summarized: fortune-tellers are becoming younger (from 15 to 30 years old, the old ones are gradually eliminated naturally), ancestral worship is becoming popular, living people's graves are becoming commercialized, paper offerings are becoming modernized, and impersonating gods and ghosts is becoming public.

Some peasants secretly ask: "The government can build big temples, why can't we build small (land, goddess, mountain god, fox spirit) temples?" This is obviously due to the failure to distinguish between the policies of protecting cultural relics, religious freedom, and feudal superstition activities. It seems that educating peasants should start with educating grassroots cadres in rural areas. Therefore, the cartoon exhibition "Goodbye, Ignorance, Superstition" is only exhibited in a few cities such as Shenyang, Xi'an, Wuhan, and Beijing, which is far from enough. We need the laughter from the pens of 120 cartoonists to resonate through the mountains, plains, and every village and hamlet. We need cross-talk, folk arts, and popular songs to join Marx's "laughing farewell to the past."

This heavy rain is indeed pleasing; the light rain that moistens things silently and supplements what is lacking, making poverty alleviation and ignorance alleviation proceed simultaneously, is what I think is more needed.

### 大雨和细雨
舒展

　　大雨和细雨
    舒展
    好像干涸的土地渴望一场透雨，上百位漫画家以笔底发出的笑声，对愚昧、迷信这块板结的冻土，下了一场及时雨。久违了，好雨！
    这些年，我们忙着搞经济改革，注意力集中在发展社会主义商品经济，忙着向贫穷告别，淡忘了向愚昧告别，封建迷信早已不是被遗忘的角落，而是一大片被遗忘的荒漠，失去了人间的绿色，几乎成了鬼蜮猖獗的阴间。
    全民科学文化素质的提高，不是几场大雨便可奏效的。列宁、毛泽东强调的“严重的问题是教育农民”，在改革中的中国今天，感到愈加尖锐、迫切、深刻！我国有８亿多农民，有２．３亿文盲。在全世界文盲总数中，中国占四分之一。这是孳生愚昧的最大温床。
    十年文革，是一场大的政治愚昧，运动了几亿人，搞的是现代迷信——造神。假如不在提高全民科学文化素质上下大功夫，不重视教育，那么，愚昧可以以新的样式出现——造鬼！活的大救星没有了，只好去寻求新的救世主——神鬼。其实上述两种愚昧的根源是一个：封建主义思想。只不过前者穿的是“革命”外衣，后者穿的是神祇道袍。黑格尔有两句话讲得好，割让人格的实例是奴隶制，割让理智的合理性则表现为迷信（《法哲学原理》７４页）。而封建主义恰恰就是蔑视人格，不要理性。
    一些地方因祖坟纠纷酿成宗族之间毁林、挖坟、大规模械斗，一些地方雇佣剧团鼓乐队，举铳扛幡，搞联宗祭祖的大示威（其中还有县级党员干部带头），不正是血统论、出身门第观、祖先崇拜的封建思想在作祟吗？一些旅游娱乐场所出现儿童穿马褂、戴假辫子和瓜皮帽，不正是大人的封建恶趣的反映吗？南方有个电脑厂在厂里大搞计算机算命，还有一个市的水泥厂因两名工人烧伤竟然不查事故原因，却大搞烧香求神活动，不也说明在一些工人中，封建思想也大有地盘吗？
    尤其触目惊心的是在几个大中城市不约而同地搞起了大规模的“过第二个龙年”的赛春节活动。据我看报的记忆，有东北的长春、本溪，华北的太原，西南的个旧。那几天，全市的鞭炮存货销售一空，从半夜到天明，鞭炮声冲天，鞭炮屑盖地，使有的外国旅游者以为：中国人疯了！一非年二非节三非庆典，干吗这么发狂！特别可笑的是，所有的桃罐头全部卖光，荒唐到旧社会胡同老娘们迷信谐音的程度：逃（桃）灾！逃（桃）难！这愚昧的规模、层次，恐怕是鲁迅笔下的鲁镇所望尘莫及的吧！有人根据目睹之怪现状，总结了以下五“化”：算命先生年轻化（从１５岁到３０岁，老的逐渐自然淘汰），联宗祭祖群众化，活人修坟商品化，纸扎冥供现代化，装神弄鬼公开化。
    有的农民暗自发问：“公家修大庙行，俺们修小（土地、娘娘、山神、狐仙）庙咋不行？”这显然是没有分清保护文物古迹、宗教信仰自由与封建迷信活动的政策界限所致。看来，教育农民，首先要教育农村基层干部。因此《别了，愚昧、迷信》的漫画展只在沈阳、西安、武汉、北京等几个城市展出，是远远不够的。要让１２０位漫画家笔底的笑声响彻山野平原村村寨寨。要让相声、曲艺、通俗歌曲都参加到马克思说的“笑着向过去告别”的行列中来。
    这场大雨固然令人高兴；润物细无声的细雨截长补短地下着，使脱贫与脱愚同步进行，我想是更加需要的吧。（附图片）
