Six men who were buried under the ruins of a nine-story building in Leninakan city, Armenia, after an earthquake, have survived 35 days underground and were finally rescued yesterday.

A 50-year-old man named Akopyan, who was among those rescued, told a Tass reporter that on December 7 last year, when the earthquake struck, he had asked five neighbors to help him move two heavy wooden barrels to the basement of their residential building. As soon as they entered the basement, they heard a loud rumble, and the building began to collapse. Akopyan said, "I thought it was the start of a war."

After the earthquake, the six men were trapped in the basement. Fortunately, the basement was stocked with many pickled vegetables, sugar water, and fruits for winter, so they had enough to eat and drink. However, they tried to conserve as much as possible to last until they were rescued.

Tass reported today that the six men are now staying in a hospital in Yerevan, the capital of Armenia.

　　废墟下被埋３５天　经抢救重见天日
    新华社莫斯科１月１２日电  被地震埋在亚美尼亚列宁纳坎市一幢９层楼废墟下的６名男子，度过３５天的“地下”生活，昨日终于重见天日。
    昨天被挖出来的５０岁的阿科皮扬对塔斯社记者说，去年１２月７日地震那天，他请５个邻居帮忙到住宅楼的地下室搬两个很沉的木桶。他们刚进到地下室，就听见轰隆一声巨响，楼房开始倒塌。阿科皮扬说：“我以为是战争开始了”。
    地震后，６人被困在地下室。幸而地下室里藏有许多腌菜、糖水和水果等过冬食品，６人吃喝不愁。但是他们尽量节约，以便坚持到得救之日。
    塔斯社今天报道说，现在这６人住在亚美尼亚首都埃里温医院。
