East German leader Honecker today called on the West to adhere to the 1971 four-power agreement on Berlin, saying this would promote mutually beneficial relations between West Berlin and East Germany.

According to the German News Agency, Honecker made the remarks during a meeting with the chairman of the West Berlin Socialist Unity Party, Schmidt. He said that the 1971 agreement signed by Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union had stabilized the situation in West Berlin, and that mutual cooperation between West Berlin and East Germany had developed in many areas. He believed that the precondition for the development of relations between West Berlin and East Germany was strict adherence to the four-power agreement.
