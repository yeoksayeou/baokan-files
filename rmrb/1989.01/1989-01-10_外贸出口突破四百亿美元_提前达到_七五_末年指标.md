	Exports Break $40 Billion Mark
	Achieve "Seventh Five-Year Plan" End-Year Target Ahead of Schedule

	People's Daily reports: According to preliminary statistics from the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, by the end of December 1988, China's exports had reached $40.1 billion, completing two years ahead of schedule the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" target of $38 billion in exports by 1990.

	Currently, China's export commodity structure has undergone "two transformations." According to customs statistics, the proportion of industrial manufactured goods in total exports has increased from 49.32% in 1985 to 69.1%; the proportion of primary products has decreased from 50.68% in 1985 to 30.9%. The market layout is becoming more diversified, with the proportion of major markets becoming more reasonable. International payment capabilities have been enhanced, foreign trade settlement conditions are good, and economic benefits are gradually improving. These developments once again prove that the central government's policy of reform and opening up is completely correct.

	Both reform and construction require foreign exchange support. The Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade requires all levels of foreign economic and trade departments and foreign trade enterprises to start from the overall situation, redouble their efforts, overcome difficulties, adopt an active policy, and maintain the good momentum of steady development in exports.

　　外贸出口突破四百亿美元
    提前达到“七五”末年指标
    本报讯  记者刘霄报道：据经贸部初步业务统计，截至１９８８年１２月底，我国外贸出口已达４０１亿美元，提前两年完成“七五”计划规定的１９９０年外贸出口３８０亿美元的指标。
    目前，我国出口商品结构出现了“两个转变”。据海关统计，工业制成品出口额占出口总额的比重由１９８５年的４９．３２％提高到６９．１％；初级产品出口额占出口总额的比重由１９８５年的５０．６８％降到３０．９％；市场布局趋向多元化，各主要市场所占比例趋于合理；国际支付能力增强，外贸收支状况良好，经济效益也逐步提高。这些再次证明中央改革开放的方针是完全正确的。
    改革和建设都需要外汇支持。经贸部要求各级经贸部门和外贸企业从大局出发，加倍努力，克服困难，采取积极的方针，保持外贸出口稳步发展的好势头。
