International News Brief

Libya Wants to Improve Relations with Britain
Libya's ambassador to the United Nations, Ali Treki, said on the 14th in New York to the British Broadcasting Corporation that Libya is willing to improve relations with Britain.

He said, "We are willing to cooperate with the British government and sit down at any level they wish to resume the negotiations we have already started." He also said, "We can discuss all issues, including the Irish Republican Army."

In response, a British government spokesman said that Britain is not yet ready to hold talks with Libya.

U.S. Withdraws Another Warship from the Gulf
In light of the reality of the ceasefire in the Iran-Iraq War, the U.S. government ordered the "Josephus Daniels" missile cruiser to withdraw from the Gulf region on the 13th.

U.S. Department of Defense spokesman Keith Schneider said that this decision was made based on the experience gained by the new U.S. escort fleet in the Gulf region after executing a one-month monitoring mission.

Currently, the U.S. has 14 ships stationed in the region and 10 ships in the adjacent Arabian Sea.

Citizens of Hans City Hold Anti-Government Protests
On the evening of the 14th, more than 4,000 young students, citizens, and opposition party members in Hans City gathered at the Myeongdong Cathedral in the city center to hold a rally and protest, demanding the resignation of the Roh Tae-woo regime.

The protesters gathered to commemorate a young student who was beaten to death by the police two years ago.

The authorities deployed more than 400 police officers to suppress the protests. The protesters resisted fiercely and held a torchlight procession in front of the Myeongdong Cathedral.

Three Palestinians Killed by Israeli Forces
At dawn on the 14th, three more Palestinians were killed by Israeli occupying forces in the occupied territories, bringing the number of Palestinians killed by Israeli forces since the outbreak of the large-scale uprising on December 8, 1987, to 594.

Reports said that among those killed on the 14th was a 45-year-old man named Taher, who was poisoned to death by Israeli forces in the Shati refugee camp in Jerusalem. The other two victims were a 12-year-old girl and a 15-year-old boy, both of whom were shot to death by Israeli forces.
