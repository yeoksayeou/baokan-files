On December 16, 1988, we witnessed a scene of daylight coal theft in the northern suburbs of Xuzhou City, Jiangsu Province, near Mengjiagou. Around 3 PM, a large truck loaded with coal was passing through Mengjiagou when it was temporarily stopped due to a roadblock. As soon as the truck stopped, a group of women swarmed over, unloading large chunks of coal into wooden carts that were already "hidden" nearby. The escort repeatedly tried to stop them, but to no avail. In the blink of an eye, two carts were fully loaded and left, with more carts rushing in behind them. The escort then started fighting with the coal thieves.

It is understood that these people are the notorious "Women's Coal-Stealing Team" from Mengjiagou. They often gang up to rob coal from passing trucks.

　　这里有一支“妇女扒煤队”
    １９８８年１２月１６日，我们在江苏徐州市北郊孟家沟一带目睹了一场光天化日之下抢煤的情景。下午３时许，一辆满载煤炭的大卡车途经孟家沟时因路障临时停下，车刚停稳，只见一群妇女蜂拥而上，把大块大块煤卸下装进早已“埋伏”好的木板车。押车人反复劝阻，无济于事，转眼工夫，两辆板车已经满载而去，后面又有几辆板车涌来。押车人随即和抢煤的人扭打起来。
    据了解，这些人是孟家沟有名的“妇女扒煤队”，她们常常结伙哄抢往来运载煤炭的车辆。
