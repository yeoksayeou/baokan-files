The widespread phenomenon of violating financial and tax laws, with various methods of falsification, has been exposed by a major financial and tax inspection in Shandong Province. The provincial Party committee and government have invested significant resources to seriously investigate and punish these violations. In the past three months, over 500 million yuan in violations have been uncovered.

Reporters Jia Jianzhou and Song Xuechun report from Jinan: The financial and tax inspection in Shandong Province, which began on September 10 last year, has progressed smoothly. By the end of last December, 659,392 administrative, enterprise, and individual business units had conducted self-inspections. A total of 189,812 enterprises and individual business units were subjected to key inspections. Over 510 million yuan in violations were uncovered, accounting for approximately 1/12 of the national total for the same period. A total of 340 million yuan in taxes should have been remitted to the treasury, with 280 million yuan already collected.

The Shandong Provincial Party Committee and government have treated the financial and tax inspection as a "breakthrough" in rectifying the environment and order, investing significant resources. According to statistics from 10 cities and regions by the end of last December, 5,775 units and individual business owners have been fined a total of 5.7 million yuan. A total of 231 responsible individuals and involved parties have been subjected to economic penalties or disciplinary actions. A total of 31 units and 38 individuals have been investigated by procuratorial organs, with 11 individuals already facing legal consequences.

From the problems exposed by the Shandong financial and tax inspection, it is evident that violations of financial and tax laws are widespread, with some issues being quite severe. The main problems include: falsification, embezzlement, misappropriation of state funds, and personal gain; concealing, transferring sales revenue and profits, tax evasion, and appropriation of state revenue; indiscriminate distribution of money and goods, entertaining and gift-giving, wasteful spending, and extravagance; embezzlement of public funds and bribery; violation of procurement regulations, purchasing restricted and banned goods, etc.

The Qingdao Cotton Mill, a medium-sized state-owned enterprise with over 2,000 employees, used methods such as transferring income, falsely listing expenses, arbitrarily allocating costs, arbitrarily issuing bonuses, and hiding construction project investments to evade and withhold taxes and profits amounting to 18.5 million yuan from 1979 to 1986. The mill set up 15 "small safes," storing 1.293 million yuan in illegal income. The former mill director, Li Xinde, directly controlled a "small safe" with over 8 million yuan. During previous financial and tax inspections, he used methods such as forging vouchers, destroying ledgers, and forming alliances to resist inspections and has now been arrested. During this inspection, the Dezhou region conducted a thorough investigation of all units in the region that purchased small cars, vans, and covered trucks in 1987 and 1988. It was found that administrative, enterprise, and individual business units had purchased over 1,800 cars in violation of procurement regulations. The relevant departments in the region are currently handling the exposed issues, with 367 cars already seized and 2.15 million yuan in fines imposed.

　　违犯财税法纪现象普遍　弄虚作假手段五花八门
    山东财税大检查揭露严重问题
    省委省政府投入大力量严肃查处
    近三个月查出违纪金额５亿多元
    本报济南１月７日电　记者贾建舟、宋学春报道：山东省自去年９月１０日开始的财税大检查进展顺利。截止去年１２月底，已有６５９３９２个行政、企事业单位和个体工商业户进行了自查，重点检查了１８９８１２个企事业单位和个体工商业户，查出违纪金额５．１亿多元，约占全国同期违纪金额的１／１２；应缴财政３．４亿元，已入库２．８亿元。
    山东省委、省政府把财税大检查作为治理环境、整顿秩序的“突破口”，投入了较强的力量。据１０个市地到去年１２月底统计，已对５７７５个违纪单位和个体工商户罚款５７０万元；有２３１名负责人和当事人受到经济处罚或政纪处分；有３１户、３８人由检察机关立案审查，已有１１人受到法律制裁。
    从山东财税大检查揭露出来的问题看，违犯财税法纪的现象比较普遍，有的问题相当严重，主要有：弄虚作假，营私舞弊，挖占国家财务，损公肥私；匿报、转移销售收入和利润，偷税漏税，侵占国家收入；乱发钱物，请客送礼，胡花乱支，铺张浪费；私分公款、贪污受贿；违反控购规定，购买专控禁购商品等。青岛市麻纺厂是一个拥有２０００多名职工的中型国营企业，该厂自１９７９年至１９８６年采取转移收入、虚列费用、乱摊成本、乱发奖金、隐瞒基建工程投资等手段偷漏和截留应上缴国家的税款、利润１８５万元。该厂私设“小钱柜”１５个，存非法收入１２９．３万元，原厂长李信德就直接控制着一个８０多万元的“小钱柜”。在历年财税大检查中，他采取造假凭证、销毁帐册、订立攻守同盟等手段，对抗检查，现已被逮捕。德州地区在这次大检查中，对全区所有单位１９８７年、１９８８年购买的小汽车、面包车、大篷车进行了彻底清查，查出行政、企事业单位违反控购规定，购买汽车１８００余辆。该地区有关部门对查出的问题正在进行处理，现已封存３６７辆汽车，罚款２１５万元。
