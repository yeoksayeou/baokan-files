The State Planning Commission has recently issued another notice regarding the specific implementation measures to restrict domestic consumption and production of easy-pull cans and other one-time packaging for beverages.

The notice requires that the production of easy-pull cans, including aluminum cans, tinplate cans, aluminum-lid plastic cans, and various types of beverages (including beer), should consolidate and expand existing export markets, open up new export channels, and strive to increase export volumes (mainly beverage exports). The production of empty cans and canned beverages for export will not be restricted.

For the import of raw and auxiliary materials, an import license system will be implemented. Those who import without approval will have their goods seized by customs.

Domestic sales of easy-pull canned beverages will be restricted to specific points of sale, focusing on stores that collect foreign exchange or foreign-related hotels and restaurants that collect foreign exchange.

In the coming years, no new construction or expansion of easy-pull can production capacity under the guise of renovation will be permitted. Approval for various forms of joint ventures, cooperative ventures, leasing, or wholly foreign-owned easy-pull can construction projects will also cease. The import of easy-pull can production lines and filling lines should be immediately stopped. Easy-pull can construction projects or introduced projects approved by local authorities should immediately stop negotiations, signing, introduction, and construction.

For paper-plastic-aluminum composite soft packaging and polyester bottle beverages, the notice stipulates the following:

1. No new factories or workshops for the production of paper-plastic-aluminum composite soft packaging materials will be approved. The import of paper-plastic-aluminum composite soft packaging production lines will be suspended.

2. The introduction of paper-plastic-aluminum composite soft packaging filling production lines will be halted. The import of polyester bottle production lines, polyester bottle filling production lines, and dual-use filling production lines for polyester bottles and glass bottles will be generally suspended.

3. The value-added tax rate for paper-plastic-aluminum composite soft packaging and polyester bottle beverage products will be increased.
