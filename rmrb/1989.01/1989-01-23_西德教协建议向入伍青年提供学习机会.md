The West German Teachers' Association in a news release yesterday suggested that the Federal Defense Forces provide more learning opportunities for young recruits to attract young people.

The teachers' association hopes that the Federal Defense Forces will enable those serving their military duty to acquire expertise in foreign languages, computers, and information technology, and issue certificates that are also valid locally, to alleviate the concerns of those serving their duty.

The Federal Government recently decided to implement the extension of the military service period starting from June 1 of this year, extending the service period from 15 months to 18 months.

This has sparked opposition from many young people, who are concerned that the extension of the military service period will affect their studies and employment. The teachers' association's suggestion is aimed at addressing the difficulties faced by some of these young people.

　　西德教协建议向入伍青年提供学习机会
    新华社波恩１月２１日电  德国教师协会在昨日散发的一份新闻公报中，建议联邦国防军向应征入伍青年提供更多的学习机会，以吸引年轻人。
    教师协会希望，联邦国防军在外语、计算机和信息技术方面使服兵役者学到专长，并发给在地方也能通用的证书，以消除服役者的后顾之忧。
    联邦政府最近决定，从今年６月１日起实施延长兵役期的决定，将服役期从１５个月延长到１８个月。
    这引起不少青年人的反对，担心延长服役期会影响他们的升学和就业。教师协会的建议是为解决这一部分青年人的困难而提出的。
