The several hundred kilometers of national defense communication trunk lines maintained by our unit pass through Qinghai Province's Minhe, Huzhu, Haibei, and Qilian counties. Over the past two years, due to farmers' blind gold mining, caves have appeared everywhere, seriously threatening the national defense communication lines. Just last summer, there were 4 incidents of telegraph pole collapses in these counties, causing frequent communication line interruptions, and some line segments had to be rerouted. We hope that the governments of these regions or the gold mining management departments will take measures to ensure the smooth operation of the national defense communication lines.

　　盲目淘金　洞穴遍地
    国防通信线路遭破坏
    我部维护的几百公里国防通信一级干线，穿越青海省的民和、互助、海北、祁连等州、县。近两年来，由于农民盲目淘金，洞穴遍地，使国防通信线路受到严重威胁。仅去年夏季，在这些州县就发生４次电杆倒塌事故，通讯线路经常中断，有的线段被迫改道。希望这些地区的政府或黄金开采管理部门采取措施，确保国防通信线路畅通无阻。
