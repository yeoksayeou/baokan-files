Edition: 3

To build our country into a prosperous, democratic, and civilized socialist modern nation and to realize the common ideal of all ethnic groups in China, we need the unremitting efforts of several generations. Today's primary and secondary school students will be the main force in the socialist construction of the 21st century. Their ideological and moral qualities, as well as their scientific and cultural literacy, not only reflect the current level of social civilization but will also have a decisive influence on the future social landscape and national spirit of our country. From now on, we must strive to cultivate them into a new generation of people with ideals, morality, culture, and discipline.

In primary and secondary school education, moral education, which includes ideological and moral education and political education, plays a crucial role in maintaining the socialist nature of schools and promoting the all-around development of students' moral, intellectual, physical, and aesthetic qualities. The primary and secondary school education stage is a period when young students grow physically and intellectually, and it is the best time to cultivate their moral character, psychological qualities, and behavioral habits. It is also an important period for laying the foundation for them to establish a scientific worldview and outlook on life and to form correct political attitudes. Paying attention to moral education during this period will have a significant and positive impact on their entire lives.

"Education is the foundation of a hundred-year plan." In all work, we must attach great importance to education. In education, we must attach great importance to primary and secondary school education. In primary and secondary school education, we must attach great importance to moral education. Local party committees and governments must have a strategic vision and take a highly responsible attitude towards the future of the nation to strengthen the leadership of moral education in primary and secondary schools. Primary and secondary schools must place moral education in an important position and consistently grasp and improve it. The whole society should also strive to care for the healthy growth of young students.

	I. Moral Education in Primary and Secondary Schools Must Adapt to the New Situation of Comprehensive Reform

Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, moral education in primary and secondary schools has undergone rectification and correction, abandoning the erroneous guideline of "class struggle as the key link." In terms of content and methods, it has made active explorations and created many fresh experiences. Broad masses of primary and secondary school teachers have been strict with themselves and set good examples, making significant contributions to the healthy growth of primary and secondary school students. We must fully recognize the achievements and progress made in moral education in primary and secondary schools and fully affirm the hard work of the broad masses of primary and secondary school teachers and educators.

China's reform and opening up are deepening. In the process of transition between the old and new systems, as a new theoretical system, ideological concepts, cultural conditions, and social environment gradually form, the corrupt ideas of capitalism and feudalism, the semi-colonial and slave-like ideas left over from history, and other backward customs will continue to exist for a long time. In the process of reform and opening up and the development of a socialist commodity economy, some negative phenomena are also inevitable. This situation poses many new challenges for moral education in primary and secondary schools. Current moral education is still not adapted to the new situation, with the main problems being: some party and government departments and schools, influenced by the pursuit of high admission rates, lack sufficient understanding of the status and role of moral education; the guiding principles of moral education in primary and secondary schools need to be further clarified, and the working system needs to be improved; the content and methods of moral education are somewhat detached from reality, rigid, and adult-oriented, lacking effectiveness and appeal; the quality of the moral education workforce needs to be further improved; social and family education are not well coordinated with school education, and there is a lack of unified understanding and effective measures to create a good social environment for the healthy growth of young students. Due to these reasons, there are many problems worth noting in primary and secondary school students' ideals, moral character, behavioral habits, legal awareness, and political understanding, and a small number of students have even gone astray. These problems indicate that it is an urgent task for us to strive to establish a new pattern of moral education that adapts to the needs of the continuous development of socialist commodity economy and democratic politics.

	II. Further Clarify the Guiding Ideology of Moral Education in Primary and Secondary Schools

Moral education in primary and secondary schools must adhere to the guidance of Marxism, seriously implement the basic line of the Party in the primary stage of socialism, and follow the Party's guiding principles for the construction of socialist spiritual civilization.

Moral education in China has a long history and good traditions. During the revolutionary war and the socialist construction period, we have accumulated rich experience. Moral education in primary and secondary schools should, on the basis of inheriting and carrying forward these good traditions and good experiences, adapt to the constantly changing new situations and endow moral education with new content and new methods that have the breath of the times.

Moral education in primary and secondary schools must adhere to the principle of seeking truth from facts, starting from the reality of the primary stage of socialism in China, from the reality of primary and secondary school education, and from the reality of young students.

We must use the common ideal to educate all students. Under the banner of the common ideal, we must inspire the national spirit of the Chinese nation, starting from primary and secondary school students. Primary and secondary schools should adopt various forms and be good at using the real achievements of socialist construction and reform, and the exemplary power of outstanding figures to carry out vivid ideal education. We must guide students to closely link their ideals and aspirations with the future of the motherland and the destiny of the nation, and arouse, mobilize, and stimulate their enthusiasm, initiative, and creativity to study hard for the realization of the Four Modernizations and the rejuvenation of China.

We must cultivate students to adapt to the social environment of reform and opening up and the development of the socialist commodity economy. Primary and secondary education must face the world, face the future, and face modernization, paying attention to cultivating students' awareness of reform and opening up, so that they can develop the concept of seeking quality and efficiency, being enterprising, and being loyal to their duties from an early age, which is suitable for the development of modern large-scale production. We must be good at using the favorable conditions provided by reform and opening up to strengthen education and guidance, so that students can gradually enhance their ability to distinguish right from wrong and resist negative influences in real life.

	III. Realistically Determine the Tasks and Content of Moral Education in Primary and Secondary Schools

The basic task of moral education in primary and secondary schools is to cultivate all students into patriotic citizens who have social public morals, civilized behavioral habits, and abide by laws and disciplines. On this basis, we guide them to gradually establish a scientific outlook on life and worldview and continuously improve their socialist ideological awareness, so that some outstanding students can grow into firm communists in the future. Moral education in primary and secondary schools should focus on the following aspects with the basic content of loving the motherland, loving the people, loving labor, loving science, and loving socialism:

First, conduct patriotism education. In moral education, we must place patriotism education in a prominent position, so that students can understand the glorious history and revolutionary traditions of the Chinese nation from an early age, understand the deep sufferings of the Chinese nation over the past hundred years and the heroic struggle led by the Communist Party against imperialism and feudalism, and understand that the socialist modernization construction we are currently engaged in is the greatest cause in Chinese history. This is to cultivate their national self-esteem, self-confidence, self-pride, and unyielding spirit of struggle, and to establish the concept that the interests of the motherland are above all else, and to despise all behaviors that damage national dignity. To this end, we must carry out textbook reforms, and all subjects should plan to carry out patriotism education in combination with the characteristics of the subjects. We must organize lively and diverse activities to integrate patriotism education. Schools must raise the national flag. Important assemblies must sing the national anthem. Important commemorative days should concentrate on conducting patriotism education. We must link patriotism education with the education of loving the Communist Party of China and loving socialism, so that students can gradually understand that the Party is the core force leading the people of all ethnic groups in the country to achieve the Four Modernizations and the great cause of rejuvenating China, and that the socialist system is the fundamental guarantee for building a modernized China.

Second, conduct collectivism education. Educate students to respect, understand, and help others, and to know from an early age that selfishness and self-interest are not good qualities. On this basis, educate them to gradually learn to correctly handle the relationship between personal interests and collective and national interests. At present, the proportion of only children in primary and secondary schools is increasing, and it is particularly important to strengthen collectivism education. Primary and secondary schools should widely organize students to participate in cultural, sports, social services, and public welfare labor and other collective activities, and in these activities, carry out competitions, select advanced collectives, and commend behaviors that do good for the collective, to cultivate students' sense of collective honor and establish a spirit of unity and mutual assistance. We must carry out education and activities to respect teachers and love schools among students.

Third, conduct education on socialist democracy and law-abiding. We must start from primary school to conduct education on democracy, legal system, and discipline, cultivate students to have democratic awareness and the spirit of masters of society, cultivate the democratic habits of minority obeying the majority and respecting others, and establish the concept of equality before truth and law. At the same time, we must educate students to understand that democracy and legal system and discipline are inseparable, understand that we must maintain the dignity of the Constitution, understand the basic rights and duties of citizens, know the basic knowledge of criminal law and other laws, and establish the concept of legal system. Primary and secondary schools must have strict school rules and regulations, establish a good school atmosphere, and combine care and love for students with strict requirements.

Fourth, conduct labor education. Seriously cultivate students' labor outlook, labor habits, and the spirit of thrift, hard work, and simplicity, which is not only an important aspect of achieving the goals of school education but also relates to the inheritance and development of our nation's fine traditions. We must seriously correct the current phenomenon of some schools neglecting labor education, starting from encouraging primary school students to participate in self-service and household labor within their abilities, and listing labor and labor technology education as an important content of primary and secondary school education, including it in the teaching plan and conducting assessments. Labor education should be carried out according to local conditions and school characteristics, and arranged according to the different age groups of students.

Fifth, conduct moral education and cultivate good psychological qualities. Moral education for primary and secondary school students, especially for primary school students, is more about cultivating habits. We must formulate and organize the trial implementation of "daily behavioral norms" for middle school and primary school students, so that students can remember the norms and gradually cultivate civilized behavioral habits. We must comprehensively cultivate and train students' moral character and psychological qualities, so that they have good qualities such as honesty, integrity, modesty, kindness, courage, perseverance, cherishing time, keeping promises, and pioneering and enterprising. The middle school stage is a period when students' bodies gradually develop and mature, and we must combine physical and mental health education to timely conduct moral education during puberty.

	IV. Reform the Ways and Methods of Moral Education in Primary and Secondary Schools and Emphasize Effectiveness

Moral education is the work of shaping students' souls. We must follow the laws of students' physical and mental growth, and in the design of specific goals, we must be stratified, and propose different requirements for middle school and primary school students.

Moral education must be combined with the imparting of scientific and cultural knowledge, permeating and running through all subjects and teaching processes and school activities, and strive to be vivid and figurative. For lower-grade students, it should also have story-like qualities. We must integrate moral education into rich and colorful activities and social practices. School life should be lively and attractive. We must strive to create opportunities for students, especially senior students, to participate in social practices, so that they can receive education by contacting society and workers and peasants.

Those engaged in moral education should love and care for students, treat them equally, understand their psychology, and respect their personality. We must enhance educational effectiveness in a democratic, equal, and harmonious atmosphere, and achieve the goal of persuading with reason and moving with emotion. We must advocate that students manage themselves, cultivate their independent spirit, and the ability to think independently and self-educate.

We must study and improve the methods of evaluating students' conduct and establish a sound system for selecting and rewarding outstanding students.

	V. Establish a System Where the Principal is Responsible for Moral Education and Strengthen the Construction of the Moral Education Team

The principal of a primary or secondary school is responsible for the leadership of moral education. The principal should not only be proficient in teaching business but also have correct educational ideas, pay attention to the all-around development of students, and ensure the implementation of the Party and the state's educational policies. The situation of moral education should be an important basis for evaluating the principal's work performance.

In school education, we must unify "teaching" and "educating people." We must emphasize that all teachers and staff are moral educators and should take on the responsibility of educating people in different positions. Class teachers, ideological and moral education teachers, political education teachers, full-time youth league cadres, and young pioneer instructors should actively play a leading role in moral education. The school party branch should support the principal's work, play a guarantee and supervision role, and influence and mobilize the broad masses of teachers and staff to do a good job in moral education through the exemplary role of party members.

Teachers should set an example and be role models. In the future, the situation of conducting ideological and moral education for students should be an essential condition for evaluating teachers and job promotions and salary increases. We must strengthen the training of teachers, continuously improve their ideological and professional level and moral cultivation. We must formulate corresponding policies to encourage outstanding teachers to teach ideological and moral education or political education courses as full-time or part-time teachers, and create conditions for their further study and improvement. Higher and secondary normal schools should carry out teaching reforms, strengthen the teaching and practical links of moral education, and make normal school students understand how to be qualified people's teachers.

The Young Pioneers, Communist Youth League, and student unions should, according to their own characteristics, actively cooperate with schools to do a good job in moral education and unite the majority of students to grow up healthily. The teachers' union should do a good job in teachers' work within its scope of duties and fully mobilize teachers' enthusiasm for teaching and educating people.

Primary and secondary schools should hire outstanding individuals from among workers, peasants, cadres, intellectuals, and soldiers to serve as off-campus instructors and strive to build a stable off-campus moral education team.

	VI. The Whole Society Should Care About the Healthy Growth of Primary and Secondary School Students

Caring for and protecting the healthy growth of primary and secondary school students is not only the responsibility of the education department and schools but also the responsibility and obligation of the whole society. We must closely combine social and family education with school education to form a social atmosphere and trend of the whole society caring for the healthy growth of primary and secondary school students.

Parents are the first teachers of their children, and all parents should be responsible to society and to their descendants, and should set an example and educate their children well. We must change the outdated and backward family education concepts and methods and improve the level of family education. Education departments and schools should actively and positively guide family education. Primary and secondary schools should absorb parents who are good at educating their children to participate in the school's educational work. Radio, television, newspapers, and other news media should open up family education programs and popularize family education knowledge.

All departments engaged in the production of spiritual products, such as news publishing, radio and television, and cultural arts, should take it as their duty to provide rich and healthy spiritual nourishment for the majority of primary and secondary school students. Broad masses of writers, artists, and theorists should strive to create works that are beneficial and loved by primary and secondary school students. We must actively do a good job in the distribution of publications and films for young people and children. We must strengthen the management of social cultural undertakings, oppose the pursuit of profit and disregard of social effects, and resolutely ban obscene publications and obscene videos. We must establish a film review and rating system, and clearly regulate films that are not suitable for primary and secondary school students to watch. We must give full play to the supervisory role of broad moral educators and primary and secondary school teachers over the above-mentioned departments. Local party committees and governments should support the organization of social appraisal activities and organize primary and secondary school teachers, students, and relevant personnel from all walks of life to appraise films and literary works. Radio, television, and newspapers can discuss issues related to the ideological and moral education of young people and guide social education.

We must adopt various ways to strengthen the connection between schools and society. In cities, districts or streets can gradually establish social organizations such as community (social) education committees through pilot projects to organize and coordinate various sectors of society to support and care for school work and optimize the social education environment. We must give full play to the positive role of retired cadres, workers, experts, scholars, model figures, and social celebrities in cultivating and educating young people and children.

	VII. Strengthen the Leadership of Moral Education in Primary and Secondary Schools

Local party committees and governments must strengthen the leadership of moral education in primary and secondary schools. Leading cadres should go deep into primary and secondary schools, timely solve problems in school moral education, and personally grasp the reform of moral education pilot projects. Local areas should organize education departments, propaganda departments, the Communist Youth League, the Women's Federation, trade unions, and other units to regularly study and discuss school moral education and closely cooperate to do a good job. We must improve the supervision system and institutions at all levels, strengthen the inspection, supervision, and evaluation of school moral education. Local areas should also gradually create conditions to give full play to the role of primary and secondary school moral education research institutions.

We must attach importance to the construction of activity venues and labor education bases for young people and children. In the long-term planning of urban construction, we must pay attention to the arrangement of off-campus educational facilities such as youth homes, youth palaces, and children's activity centers. For all places with educational significance for young people and children, such as museums and exhibition halls, we must reduce or exempt fees and open them to primary and secondary school students. Profit-making cultural facilities such as cinemas should also arrange a certain amount of time each year to serve primary and secondary school students for free or at a low cost. Local areas should help schools establish labor education bases and determine some enterprises and institutions to accept students to visit and participate in social practice activities. We must strictly prohibit the occupation of activity venues and labor education bases for young people and children.

Local education administrative departments must rectify their educational ideas and seriously implement the Party and the state's educational policies. We must resolutely correct the tendency to pursue high admission rates and resist the wrong practice of some leading departments imposing admission targets on schools. To make moral education in primary and secondary schools institutionalized, standardized, and implemented, the State Education Commission should promptly formulate and organize the trial implementation of moral education outlines and daily behavioral norms for primary and secondary school students. We must quickly formulate relevant regulations and use legal weapons to protect the healthy growth of young people and children.

All types of secondary and vocational schools should also reform and strengthen school moral education according to the above spirit. According to the characteristics of vocational and technical schools, we should also pay attention to strengthening the education and cultivation of students' professional ethics.

　　中共中央关于改革和加强中小学德育工作的通知
    （一九八八年十二月二十五日）
    把我国建设成为富强、民主、文明的社会主义现代化国家，实现全国各族人民的共同理想，需要经过几代人的不懈努力。现在的中小学生是二十一世纪社会主义建设的主力军。他们的思想道德和科学文化素质状况，不仅是当前社会文明程度的重要体现之一，而且对我国未来的社会风貌、民族精神有着决定性的影响。从现在起，就必须努力把他们培养成为有理想、有道德、有文化、有纪律的一代新人。
    在中小学教育中，德育即思想品德和政治教育，对坚持学校的社会主义性质，促进学生德智体美全面发展，具有重要的作用。中小学教育阶段是青少年儿童长身体、长知识的时期，是对他们进行道德情操、心理品质和行为习惯养成教育的最佳时期，也是为他们树立科学的人生观、世界观和形成正确的政治态度奠定基础的重要时期。抓紧这一时期的德育工作，对他们的一生将有重要的积极的影响。
    “百年大计，教育为本”。在各项工作中要十分重视教育工作，教育工作中要十分重视中小学教育工作，中小学教育工作中要十分重视德育工作。各级党委和政府要有战略远见，以对民族的未来高度负责的态度，加强对中小学德育工作的领导。中小学校必须把德育工作放在重要位置，始终如一地抓紧抓好。全社会都要努力关心青少年儿童的健康成长。
    　　　　一、中小学德育工作必须适应全面深化改革的新形势
    党的十一届三中全会以来，中小学德育工作经过拨乱反正，在指导思想上抛弃了“以阶级斗争为纲”，在内容和方法上进行了积极的探索，创造了许多新鲜经验。广大中小学教师严以律己，为人师表，对中小学生的健康成长做出了很大的贡献。必须充分看到中小学德育工作取得的成绩和进步，充分肯定广大中小学教师和教育工作者为此付出的辛勤劳动。
    我国的改革开放正在深入发展。在新旧两种体制交替过程中，新的理论体系、思想观念、文化条件和社会环境逐渐形成的同时，资本主义、封建主义的腐朽思想、历史遗留的半殖民地奴化思想和其它落后习俗的影响会长期存在。在改革开放和发展商品经济的过程中，也不可避免地会出现某些消极现象。这种状况使中小学德育工作面临许多新的课题。现在的德育工作还很不适应新形势的要求，存在的主要问题是：一些党政部门和学校受片面追求升学率的影响，对德育的地位和作用缺乏足够的认识；中小学德育工作的指导方针还需要进一步明确，工作制度需要健全；德育内容和方法存在着一些脱离实际和呆板生硬、成人化等倾向，缺乏实效和吸引力；德育工作队伍的素质还需要进一步提高；社会和家庭教育同学校教育配合不够，对为青少年儿童健康成长创造良好的社会环境还缺乏统一认识和有力措施。由于这些原因，中小学生在理想情操、道德风貌、行为习惯、法纪观念和政治认识等方面存在着不少值得重视的问题，极少数学生甚至走上歧途。这些问题说明，努力建立适应社会主义商品经济和民主政治不断发展需要的德育工作新格局，是摆在我们面前的一项十分紧迫的任务。
    　　　　二、进一步明确中小学德育工作的指导思想
    中小学德育工作必须坚持以马克思主义为指导，认真贯彻党在社会主义初级阶段的基本路线，遵循党关于社会主义精神文明建设的指导方针。
    德育在我国有悠久的历史和良好的传统，在革命战争年代和社会主义建设时期，我们又积累了丰富的经验。中小学德育工作要在继承和发扬这些好传统、好经验的基础上，适应不断发展变化的新情况，赋予德育具有时代气息的新内容和新方法。
    中小学德育工作要坚持实事求是的思想路线，从我国社会主义初级阶段的实际出发，从中小学教育工作的实际出发，从青少年儿童的实际出发。
    要用共同理想教育全体学生。在共同理想的旗帜下振奋中华民族的民族精神，必须从中小学生抓起。中小学校要采取多种形式，善于运用社会主义建设和改革的现实成就，运用优秀人物的榜样力量，进行生动的理想教育。要引导学生把自己的理想抱负同祖国的前途、民族的命运紧密地联系在一起，激发、调动他们为实现四化、振兴中华而努力学习的积极性、主动性和创造性。
    要培养学生适应改革开放和发展社会主义商品经济的社会环境。中小学教育必须面向世界、面向未来、面向现代化，注意培养学生的改革开放意识，使他们从小养成讲求质量和效率，勇于进取，忠于职守等同发展现代化大生产相适应的观念。要善于利用改革开放提供的有利条件，加强教育和引导，使学生在现实生活中逐步增强辨别是非和抵制不良影响的能力。
    　　　　三、实事求是地确定中小学德育工作的任务和内容
    中小学德育工作的基本任务是，把全体学生培养成为爱国的具有社会公德、文明行为习惯的遵纪守法的好公民。在这个基础上，引导他们逐步确立科学的人生观、世界观，并不断提高社会主义思想觉悟，使他们中的优秀分子将来能够成长为坚定的共产主义者。中小学德育要以爱祖国、爱人民、爱劳动、爱科学、爱社会主义为基本内容，注意抓好以下几个方面的教育：
    第一，进行爱国主义教育。在德育工作中，要把爱国主义教育放在突出的位置，使学生从小就了解中华民族的光辉历史和革命传统，了解百多年来中华民族的深重灾难和共产党领导人民进行的反帝反封建的英勇斗争，了解我们现在从事的社会主义现代化建设是中国历史上最伟大的事业，以培育他们的民族自尊心、自信心、自豪感和自强不息的奋斗精神，树立祖国利益高于一切的观念，憎恶一切丧失国格的行为。为此，要搞好教材改革，各科教学都要有计划地结合学科特点进行爱国主义教育。要通过组织生动活泼、形式多样的活动，把爱国主义的教育融会进去。学校要升国旗。重要集会要唱国歌。重要纪念日前后要集中进行爱国主义教育。要把爱国主义教育同热爱中国共产党、热爱社会主义的教育联系起来，使学生逐步懂得党是领导全国各族人民实现四化、振兴中华大业的核心力量，社会主义制度是建设现代化中国的根本保证。
    第二，进行集体主义教育。教育学生尊重他人，理解他人，帮助他人，从小懂得自私自利是不好的品质。在此基础上，教育他们逐步学会正确处理个人利益同集体利益和国家利益的关系。当前，中小学生中独生子女的比例增大，加强集体主义的教育尤为重要。中小学校要广泛组织学生参加文娱、体育、社会服务和公益劳动等集体活动，并在这些活动中开展竞赛，评选先进集体，表扬为集体做好事的行为，培养学生的集体荣誉感，树立团结互助的风尚。要在学生中开展尊师爱校的教育和活动。
    第三，进行社会主义民主和遵纪守法的教育。要从小学开始进行民主、法制和纪律的教育，培育学生具有民主意识和社会主人翁的精神，养成少数服从多数和尊重他人的人格等民主习惯，树立在真理、法律面前人人平等的观念。同时，要教育学生懂得民主和法制、纪律不可分，懂得必须维护宪法的尊严，了解公民的基本权利和义务，知道刑法等法律的基本知识，树立公民的法制观念。中小学校都要有严格的校纪校规，树立良好的校风，要把对学生的关怀和爱护同严格要求结合起来。
    第四，进行劳动教育。认真培养学生的劳动观点、劳动习惯和勤俭节约、艰苦朴素的精神，不仅是实现学校教育目标的重要方面，而且关系着我们民族优良传统的发扬光大。要认真纠正当前一些学校忽视劳动教育的现象，从鼓励小学生参加力所能及的自我服务性劳动和家务劳动开始，把劳动和劳动技术教育作为中小学教育的一个重要内容，列入教学计划并进行考核。开展劳动教育要因地因校制宜，根据学生的不同年龄段加以安排。
    第五，进行道德教育和良好心理品质的培养。德育对中小学生特别是小学生，更多的是养成教育。要制定并组织试行中学生和小学生的“日常行为规范”，使学生牢记规范要求，逐渐养成文明的行为习惯。对学生的道德情操、心理品质要进行综合的培养和训练，使他们具有诚实正直、谦虚宽厚、勇敢坚毅、惜时守信、开拓进取等良好品质。中学阶段是学生身体逐渐发育成熟的时期，要结合生理、心理卫生教育适时地进行青春期道德教育。
    　　　　四、改革中小学德育工作的方式方法，注重实效
    德育工作是塑造学生心灵的工作。必须遵循中小学生身心成长的规律，在具体目标设计上要分层次，对中学生、小学生分别提出不同的要求。
    德育要与传授科学文化知识相结合，渗透、贯穿在各科教材和教学过程及学校各项活动中，并力求生动和形象化，对低年级学生还要有故事性。要寓德育于丰富多采的活动和社会实践之中。校园生活要活跃，富于吸引力。要努力为学生特别是高年级学生创造参加社会实践的机会，使他们在接触社会、接触工农中受到教育。
    从事德育工作的人员，要热爱和关心学生，与学生平等相处，理解他们的心理，尊重他们的人格。要在民主、平等、和谐的气氛中增强教育效果，做到以理服人，以情感人，入耳入脑。要倡导学生自己管理自己，培养他们的自主精神和独立思考、自我教育的能力。
    要研究改进学生操行评定办法，健全优秀学生评选和奖励制度。
    　　　　五、建立校长负责德育工作的体制，加强德育工作队伍的建设
    中小学校长对德育工作负有领导责任。校长不仅应当精通教学业务，而且应当具有正确的教育思想，重视学生的全面发展，保证党和国家教育方针的贯彻执行。德育工作状况应作为考核校长工作成绩的重要依据。
    在学校教育中，要把“教书”和“育人”统一起来。要强调全体教师和职工都是德育工作者，都要在不同的岗位上担负起育人的职责。班主任、思想品德课和政治课教师、共青团专职干部和少先队辅导员要在德育工作中积极发挥骨干作用。学校党支部要支持校长的工作，发挥保证监督作用，并通过党员的先锋模范作用，影响和带动广大教职工做好德育工作。
    教师要以身作则，为人师表。今后，对学生进行思想品德教育的情况，应作为考核教师和职务评聘、工资晋升的一项必备条件。要加强对教师的培训，不断提高他们的思想业务水平和道德素养。要制定相应的政策，鼓励优秀的教师担任思想品德课或政治课的专、兼职教师，并为他们创造进修提高的条件。高等和中等师范学校要搞好教学改革，加强德育的教学和实践环节，使师范院校的学生懂得如何当好一名合格的人民教师。
    少先队、共青团组织、学生会要根据自己的特点，积极配合学校做好德育工作，团结广大学生走健康成长的道路。教育工会要在本职范围内做好教师的工作，充分调动教师教书育人的积极性。
    中小学校要聘请工人、农民、干部、知识分子、解放军战士中的优秀分子担任校外辅导员，努力建设一支稳定的校外德育工作队伍。
    　　　　六、全社会都要关心中小学生的健康成长
    关心和保护中小学生健康成长，不仅是教育部门和学校的职责，而且是全社会的责任和义务。要把社会和家庭教育同学校教育密切地结合起来，形成全社会关心中小学生健康成长的舆论和风气。
    家长是孩子的启蒙教师，所有家长都应对社会负责，对后代负责，身体力行，教育好子女。要转变陈旧落后的家庭教育观念和方法，提高家庭教育的水平。教育部门和学校要积极主动地指导家庭教育。中小学要吸收善于教育子女的家长代表参与学校的教育工作。广播、电视、报刊等新闻工具应开辟家庭教育节目，普及家庭教育知识。
    新闻出版、广播影视、文化艺术等一切从事精神产品生产的部门，要把为广大中小学生提供丰富健康的精神营养作为义不容辞的责任。广大作家、艺术家、理论家应努力创作为中小学生所喜爱的有益的作品。要积极做好青少年儿童出版物、影视片的发行工作。要切实加强对社会文化事业的管理，反对只顾牟利、无视社会效果的行为。要坚决查禁淫秽书刊、淫秽录像等非法出版物。要建立对影视片的审查定级制度，对中小学生不宜观看的影视片作出明确的规定。要发挥广大德育工作者和中小学教师对上述部门的监督作用。各级党委和政府要支持开展社会评议活动，组织中小学教师、学生和社会各界有关人士对影视和文学作品进行评议。广播、电视、报刊等可就青少年思想品德教育问题开展讨论，对社会教育进行指导。
    要采取多种方式加强学校和社会的联系。城市的区或街道可通过试点，逐步建立社区（社会）教育委员会一类的社会组织，以组织、协调社会各界支持、关心学校工作，优化社会教育环境。充分发挥离退休老干部、老工人、专家学者、模范人物、社会知名人士等在培养教育青少年儿童中的积极作用。
    　　　　七、加强对中小学德育工作的领导
    各级党委和政府要切实加强对中小学德育工作的领导。领导干部要深入中小学，及时解决学校德育工作中的问题，并亲自抓好德育工作改革的试点。各地要组织教育部门、宣传部门、共青团、妇联、工会等单位定期研讨学校德育工作，密切配合做好工作。要健全各级督学机构和制度，加强对学校德育工作的检查、督促和评估。各地还要逐步创造条件，发挥中小学德育研究机构的作用。
    要重视青少年儿童活动场所和劳动教育基地的建设。城镇建设的长期规划中，要注意安排少年之家、少年宫、儿童活动中心等校外教育设施。对青少年儿童有教育意义的一切地方，如博物馆、展览馆等，要减免收费，对中小学生开放。影剧院等营利性的文化设施，每年也应安排一部分时间免费或低费为中小学生服务。各地要努力帮助学校建立劳动教育基地，确定一些企事业单位接受学生参观和参加社会实践活动。严禁挤占青少年儿童活动场所和劳动教育基地。
    各级教育行政部门要端正教育思想，认真贯彻党和国家的教育方针。要坚决纠正片面追求升学率的倾向，抵制某些领导部门向学校压升学指标等错误做法。为使中小学德育工作制度化、规范化，并落到实处，国家教育委员会要抓紧制定和组织试行中小学德育纲要、中小学生日常行为规范。要尽快制订有关法规，运用法律武器保护青少年儿童健康成长。
    各类中、初级职业技术学校也应按照上述精神，改革和加强学校德育工作。根据职业技术学校的特点，还要注意加强对学生的职业道德的教育和培养。
