	Plugging the Loopholes in Birth Control for Mobile Populations
	Yiwu City Reverses the Trend of Out-of-Plan Births

	Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, January 28 (Reporters Zhu Guoxian and He Lingling) Yiwu City in Zhejiang Province, known nationwide for its small commodity market, has focused on the weak links in family planning work, particularly addressing the issue of uncontrolled out-of-plan births among mobile populations. In 1988, the city's family planning compliance rate increased by 14% compared to 1987, and out-of-plan second and multiple births decreased by 62%.

	In recent years, among the population of Yiwu City who have gone out to do business or engage in labor services, there are 20,551 women of childbearing age. Of these, 1,917 have not implemented birth control measures, and 1,247 have specifically gone out to avoid family planning. Meanwhile, among those from other places who come to Yiwu to do business, the phenomenon of over-births and hurried births is also very serious. Due to the complexity and variability of mobile populations, Yiwu City's family planning work once faced a passive situation of "local authorities can't manage, and external authorities can't control."

	In response to this situation, Yiwu City has made strengthening the management of mobile populations a breakthrough in family planning work. They have formulated implementation rules, deciding to leverage the functions of various relevant departments to work together; implement dual management by the household registration location, the unit at the household registration location, and the current residence, the current employment unit or business unit of mobile populations, and conduct graded and line management according to the different occupations of those who go out and come in.

	The industrial and commercial administrative department of Yiwu City strictly controls according to the regulations, requiring married couples of childbearing age to obtain a "Family Planning Certificate" before issuing a business license; the public security department also inquires about family planning situations when handling temporary residence registration; all public and collective enterprises or individual businesses must verify the "Family Planning Certificate" when hiring; tenants and those living with relatives must also present the "Family Planning Certificate." Additionally, a reward and punishment system for out-of-town populations has been established, implementing regular inspections; a registration system for incoming populations has been established, implementing unified management.

	The Yiwu City government has also included strengthening the management of mobile populations as an important part of the target responsibility system and post responsibility system, using it as one of the criteria for evaluating officials' performance. Especially for the small commodity market, the Yiwu City government has specially set up a family planning management office within the market, staffed with two full-time officials, to establish family planning records for stallholders and work with relevant departments to effectively carry out family planning work. After more than a year of exploration, Yiwu City has initially reversed the situation of uncontrolled family planning among mobile populations, which was previously the most difficult to manage.

　　堵住外出和外来流动人口生育大漏洞    
    义乌市扭转计划外生育失控局面
    新华社杭州１月２８日电（记者朱国贤、何玲玲）以小商品市场闻名全国的浙江省义乌市，针对计划生育工作中的薄弱环节，狠抓流动人口计划外生育失控难题，１９８８年全市计划生育符合率比１９８７年提高１４％，计划外二胎和多胎下降６２％。
    近年来，义乌市外出经商和从事劳务活动的人口中有育龄妇女２０５５１人，未落实节育措施的有１９１７人，专为躲避计划生育外出的有１２４７人。同时外地人来义乌做生意的人当中，超生抢生的现象也十分严重。由于外出和外来流动人口复杂多变难掌握，使义乌市计划生育工作一度出现“本地管不到，外地管不了”的被动局面。
    针对这一实际情况，义乌市把加强对流动人口的管理，作为计划生育工作的突破口。他们制订出管理实施细则，决定发挥各有关部门的职能作用，齐抓共管；实行流动人口的户籍所在地、户籍所在地单位和现居住地、现用工单位或经商单位双边管理，并根据外出人口和外来人口的职业不同，进行分级、分线管理等。
    义乌市工商行政管理部门依据条例严格把关，在审批营业执照时，规定已婚育龄夫妇必须凭《计划生育证明》签发执照；公安部门在办理暂住户口登记时，也要查问计划生育情况；全民、集体企业或个体户用人时，也必须验证《计划生育证明》；房屋租户、居住在亲友家的育龄妇女必须交验《计划生育证明》。另外，还规定了对外出人口建立计划生育奖惩制度，实行定期检查；对外来人口建立登记制度，实行统一管理。
    义乌市政府还把加强流动人口管理列为目标管理责任制和岗位责任制的重要内容，作为考核干部政绩的依据之一。特别是对小商品市场，义乌市政府专门在场内设置计划生育管理办公室，配备了二名专职干部，对设摊经商人员，建立计划生育帐卡，协同有关部门切实做好计划生育工作。经过一年多的探索，义乌市已初步扭转了工作难度最大的外来外出人员计划生育失控的局面。
