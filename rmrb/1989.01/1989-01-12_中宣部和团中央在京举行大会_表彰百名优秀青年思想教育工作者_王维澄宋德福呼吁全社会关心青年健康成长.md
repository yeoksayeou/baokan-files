Today, 100 individuals dedicated to youth ideological education work, carrying the hardships of dedication and the joy of cultivation, were commended in Beijing by the Central Propaganda Department and the Communist Youth League.

This is a special team composed of experts, scholars, teachers, entrepreneurs, community residents, leaders at various levels, military commanders, and retired cadres. In the tide of reform, they have not forgotten the youth, loving and protecting them, and have created valuable experiences in carrying out youth ideological education work at different posts, producing a good social influence. In the activity of "Selecting National Excellent Youth Ideological Educators" organized by the Propaganda Department of the Communist Youth League and the editorial department of "Party Building," they were recommended by grassroots organizations, provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, and relevant departments and organs, and were evaluated by the selection office to become the first batch of advanced models of youth ideological education work selected by the whole society.

Song Renqiong, Rui Xingwen, Yan Mingfu, Chen Muhua, and others attended the commendation conference. The conference was held in the Great Hall of the People.

Wang Weicheng, Vice Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, called on the whole society to care for the healthy growth of the younger generation, so that the socialist cause created by revolutionary predecessors can be passed on from generation to generation, with each generation surpassing the last.

Wang Weicheng said that the current central task of youth ideological education work is to actively guide the broad masses of young people to unite around the Party Central Committee, resolutely implement the basic line formulated by the 13th Party Congress and the policy of rectification, adjustment, and reform proposed by the Third Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee, work together, overcome difficulties, and push the construction and reform forward with unwavering determination. He said that under the conditions of reform and opening up, young people's thoughts are very active and present complex phenomena, which is very normal. Young people have the least conservative thoughts and love to pursue new ideas. Their various actions to pursue progress for the prosperity of the motherland, we should give good support. Due to the young people's lack of experience in the world, they lack the ability to distinguish some problems, which will cause some young people to have confusion and bewilderment in their thoughts, and some even go astray. This requires correct guidance. Youth ideological education is a very important and meticulous work. Under the new historical conditions, the requirements for educators themselves have been greatly increased. Every youth ideological educator must truly become a good teacher and friend of the youth, a confidant of the youth.

Song Defu, the First Secretary of the Communist Youth League Central Committee, emphasized at the meeting that youth ideological education work is an important part of the Party's overall ideological and political work. Over the past 10 years, youth ideological education work has adapted and developed in transformation and reform, with some innovations. However, from the current situation, there is also a tendency of weakness and lack of strength that needs to be actively improved and strengthened.

In his speech, he proposed to strive to build a youth ideological education work team with combat effectiveness. Absorb a large number of excellent, knowledgeable, and dedicated comrades to engage in this cause. He said that doing a good job in youth ideological education work is a requirement of reform and modernization construction. Through effective ideological education work, shape the youth to have the modern spiritual qualities needed for modernization construction. The key to youth ideological education work at present is to implement the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee. Guide the youth to fully understand the importance and necessity of reform while fully understanding the arduousness and complexity of reform. Through democratic discussion and equal dialogue, help the youth correctly understand the difficulties and problems that arise in the reform, timely adjust their psychological structure, enhance their ability to bear, and work together with the Party to push the reform cause forward. Youth ideological education work should focus on socialization. Mobilize all forces, work together, manage together, and comprehensively govern, and do youth ideological education in every field of youth life.

At the meeting, Dai Nianxi, Party Secretary of Lanzhou Refinery, spoke on behalf of the 100 award winners. The commendation conference also reported and commended 88 advanced youth ideological educators.

　　中宣部和团中央在京举行大会
    表彰百名优秀青年思想教育工作者
    王维澄宋德福呼吁全社会关心青年健康成长
    本报北京１月１１日讯  记者周庆报道：今天，１００名热心于青年思想教育工作的人士，带着奉献的艰辛、耕耘的欢乐，在北京受到中宣部和团中央的表彰。
    这是一支由专家、学者、教师、企业家、街道居民、各级领导、解放军指挥员、离退休干部组成的特殊队伍。在改革的大潮中，他们不忘青年，爱护青年，在不同的岗位上，创造了开展青年思想教育工作的宝贵经验，产生了良好的社会影响。在共青团中央宣传部和《党建》杂志社开展的“评选全国优秀青年思想教育工作者”活动中，他们经过基层组织、各省市自治区和有关部委、机关的推荐，经过评选办公室的评审，成为国内首次由全社会评选出的青年思想教育工作的先进典型。
    宋任穷、芮杏文、阎明复、陈慕华等出席了表彰大会。大会在人民大会堂举行。
    中宣部副部长王维澄在表彰会上呼吁全社会都要关心青年一代的健康成长，使革命前辈开创的社会主义事业代代相传，一代胜似一代。
    王维澄说，当前青年思想教育工作的中心任务，就是要积极引导广大青年团结在党中央周围，坚决贯彻执行党的十三大制定的基本路线和十三届三中全会提出的治理、整顿、改革的方针，同心同德，克服困难，坚定不移地把建设和改革推向前进。他说，在改革开放的条件下，青年的思想十分活跃，呈现出纷繁复杂的现象，这是很正常的。青年最少保守思想，最爱追求新思想。他们为祖国的繁荣昌盛而追求进步的各种行动，我们要很好地加以支持。由于青年涉世不深，经验不足，对有些问题缺乏辨别能力，这就会使有些青年在思想上出现这样或那样的困惑、迷惘，有的甚至走上了歧途。这就需要正确引导。青年思想教育是一项十分重要又十分细致的工作。在新的历史条件下，对教育者本身的要求也大大提高了，每一个青年思想教育工作者都要真正成为青年的良师益友，成为青年的知心人。
    共青团中央第一书记宋德福在会上强调，青年思想教育工作是党的整个思想政治工作中的重要组成部分。１０年来，青年思想教育工作在转变中适应，在改革中发展，有了一定的创新。但是，从当前看，也有软弱无力的倾向需要积极改进，切实加强。
    他在讲话中提出，要努力建立一支有战斗力的青年思想教育工作队伍。吸收一大批素质优良、学识丰富、勇于献身的同志来从事这项事业。他说，做好青年思想教育工作是改革和现代化建设的客观要求。要通过卓有成效的思想教育工作，塑造青年具备现代化建设所需要的现代精神素质。要把贯彻落实党的十三届三中全会精神作为当前青年思想教育工作的重点。引导青年充分认识改革的重要性、必要性的同时，充分认识改革的艰巨性、复杂性。要通过民主讨论、平等对话，帮助青年正确认识改革中出现的困难和问题，及时调整心理结构，增强承受能力，与党同心同德，共同奋斗，把改革事业不断推向前进。青年思想教育工作应着眼于社会化。要动员一切力量，通力协作，齐抓共管，综合治理，把青年思想教育做到青年生活的每一个领域。
    会上，兰州炼油厂党委书记戴年喜代表１００名获奖者讲了话。表彰大会上，还通报表扬了８８名先进青年思想教育工作者。
