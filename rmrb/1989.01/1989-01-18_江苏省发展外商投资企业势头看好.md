In 1988, Jiangsu Province approved 247 foreign-invested enterprises, with a contract value of foreign capital reaching $300 million, both of which exceeded the total of the previous 10 years.

By the end of last year, Jiangsu Province had approved a total of 441 foreign-invested enterprises, with a total investment of $1.35 billion. Of this, the contract value of foreign capital accounted for 38.5% of the total investment.

Jiangsu Province has a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises and developed township enterprises. In recent years, the development of foreign-invested enterprises focused on production, operation, and export earnings has been promising. Currently, nearly 200 of the approximately 200 foreign-invested enterprises that have been completed and put into production fall into this category, accounting for about 80%. At the same time, the province has also established a number of large and medium-sized projects with considerable scale and technical level. For example, the Huafu Color Display System Company, a joint venture between the Huadong Electronic Tube Factory and the Dutch Philips Company, has a total investment of $180 million.

    江苏省发展外商投资企业势头看好
  　１９８８年江苏省批准外商投资企业２４７家，外资的合同金额达３亿美元，均超过前１０年的总和。
    截至去年年底，江苏省已批准外商投资企业４４１家，总投资达１３．５亿美元，其中外资的合同金额占总投资的３８．５％。
    江苏省中小企业多、乡镇企业发达，近年来发展生产经营、出口创汇的外商投资企业势头看好。目前建成投产的近２００家外商投资企业，这一类约占８０％。同时，全省还兴办了一批有相当规模、相当技术水平的大中项目。如华东电子管厂与荷兰菲力浦公司合资的华飞彩色显示系统公司，总投资为１．８亿美元。
