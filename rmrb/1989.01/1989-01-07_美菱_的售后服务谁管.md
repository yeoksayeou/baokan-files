In June 1988, I spent nearly 3,000 yuan to purchase a Meiling-Ariston refrigerator produced by the Hefei Refrigerator General Factory. At the time of purchase, the door of the refrigerator's cold storage compartment did not close tightly. The salesperson said it would be fine after some use. After using it, I found that the refrigerator often leaked gas and water. From the outside of the refrigerator, you could see the cold storage compartment, and the power consumption was much higher than stated in the manual. I have contacted the maintenance center in my city set up by the Hefei Refrigerator General Factory twice, but they have dismissed me with various excuses. I have also directly reported the issue to the factory, but they still told me to contact the maintenance center. This attitude towards after-sales service has left me disappointed.

　　“美菱”的售后服务谁管
    １９８８年６月，我花近３０００元买了一台合肥电冰箱总厂生产的美菱—阿里斯顿冰箱。我买时，这台冰箱冷藏室的门关闭不严，售货员说，用用就会好的。使用后，我发现这台冰箱经常漏气冒水，从冰箱外面可以看到冰箱冷藏室，耗电量比说明书说的要大得多。我和合肥电冰箱总厂设在我市的维修中心联系过两次，他们以种种理由打发了事。我向厂里直接反映，他们仍让我跟维修中心联系。这种售后服务的态度，使我失望。
