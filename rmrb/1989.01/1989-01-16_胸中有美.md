Title: Beauty in the Heart

A new tourist spot has opened, and I came here with a friend to take a boat ride and enjoy the scenery.

The scenery here is picturesque, with beautiful mountain colors, deep valleys, and ever-changing wonders, making one's spirits soar and sighs of admiration escape.

Suddenly, two young men with small mustaches nearby expressed their disappointment: "Ah, this is boring! We've wasted this money; it would have been better to drink a few bottles of soda."

Why do people viewing the same scenery have such starkly different impressions and feelings?

Having beauty in one's heart and not having beauty in one's heart are two different realms. They reflect differences in people's thoughts, culture, spirit, art, aesthetic sense, and cultivation. They also reflect differences due to the observer's subjective mood and the objective environment. Therefore, in the interplay of emotion and scenery, the specific experiences and feelings that arise naturally differ greatly.

As the saying goes, "Love is blind." "A son is always the best in his mother's eyes." "Even a worn-out broom is precious at home." Subjective coloration is indeed very strong.

Having bamboo in one's heart and not having bamboo in one's heart directly influences the bamboo in a painter's work, as well as the quality of that bamboo.

A book titled "Theory of Nude Art" sold over ten thousand copies. Different readers appreciate different aspects: aestheticians study beauty and ugliness, art students see the structure and lines of the human body, light and dark, curves and straight lines, while those with impure thoughts see only male and female sexual organs and imagine lewd scenes.

Visiting Guilin's Seven Star Cave and Reed Flute Cave, everyone marvels at the wonders of nature and the guide's ingenious explanations. One guide told a poet traveling with them, "If you use a poet's abundant emotions and clever imagination, you can blend these natural wonders into your inspiration and fantastical associations. Then, you can imagine thousands of more wondrous scenes and feel thousands of more beautiful sensations!"

The beauty and ugliness, truth and falsehood, good and evil of objective things all align with the writer's subjective feelings.

Only with beauty in one's heart can one discover the beauty of nature, the beauty of life, and thus produce associations and imaginings of beauty. This is an important principle in artistic creation!

　　胸中有美
    胡德培
    新开了一个旅游点，我与友人来此乘船观览。
    此处风光旖旎，山色秀美，峡谷幽深，奇景变幻，令人情趣盎然，嗟叹不已。
    忽然，旁边有两位蓄着小胡子的青年人十分遗憾地说：“唉，没劲！白花了这几块钱，真不如喝几瓶汽水哩！”
    为什么同赏一处景色，不同的人印象和感受会有这样强烈的反差呢？
    胸中有美与胸中无美是两种不同的境界，是人们的思想、文化、精神、艺术、美感等等的不同，修养的不同，以及由于观赏人的主观心境与客观环境的不同，因此，在情与景的交相融会中，从而产生的具体体验和感触自然也就差异很大了。
    俗话说：“情人眼里出西施。”“儿子总是自家的好。”“家有敝帚，享以千金。”主观色彩实在太浓了。
    胸中有竹与胸中无竹，直接影响着画家笔下之竹，以及此竹之好赖与优劣。
    一本《裸体艺术论》的理论著述，销行十余万册。不同的读者所欣赏之处显然有很大的不同：审美者研究着美与丑，习画者看见的是人体构造及线条的明、暗、曲、直，滥情者竟满眼都是男与女的性欲器官及联想到淫乱之情事等等。
    参观桂林的七星岩和芦笛岩，对其间大自然的神奇造化和导游者的奇妙解说，人们无不赞叹。有一位导游者对同游的诗人说：“如果你运用诗人充沛的情感和巧妙的想象，将这些自然造化融入灵感的畅游与幻象般的联想，那么，你完全可以想象出千百种更加新奇的景观，生发出千百种更加美妙的感受！”
    客观事物的美与丑，真与假，善与恶，都与作家的主观感受相一致。
    胸中有美，你才能去发现大自然的美，发现生活中的美，从而产生出对美的联想与虚构，这可是艺术创造中的一条重要法则啊！
