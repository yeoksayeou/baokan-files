The author of “The Life of Byron” says: Poets like Byron, who roam freely in the boundless universe, are “unable to have fellow travelers.” He wanders alone in the world of imagination and emotion, and even his parents, wife, and friends cannot understand him.

This is undoubtedly sad! Therefore, some people fear solitude and curse it. But from ancient times to the present, those persistent pioneers, travelers, innovators, and today's reformers often encounter the experience of not being understood. Qu Yuan's sighs by the Miluo River and Chen Zi'ang's cry on the Youzhou Terrace, “I see no one before me, and I see no one after me,” to a certain extent, express the deep sense of solitude of “ancient sages all being lonely.” A person who is indifferent to the universe and life will never have such a strong sense of anxiety, loneliness, and the courage to transcend time and space.

From an aesthetic perspective, solitude is both a situation and an aesthetic attitude that mobilizes “creative potential.” Only by forgetting rewards and punishments, discarding selfish thoughts, and eliminating external interference can one make the mind clear and tranquil. When one is tranquil, “the spirit flows freely,” and the lord of inspiration can enter the room, and creative potential can flow out. Hemingway said: “Writing, at its most successful, is a lonely career.” He believed that “a writer who grows up in a crowd naturally can avoid the hardships of loneliness, but his works often become mediocre.” Because he often indulges in the present moment's crowd mentality, unable to transcend the reality of time and space, and engage in higher-level independent thinking about life and the universe.

From the perspective of personal beauty, it is also extremely necessary to be content with loneliness, dare to forge one's own path, and have the character of independent thinking and action. Perhaps it is because outsiders see more clearly, but many foreign scholars bluntly point out that many contemporary Chinese writers and artists: first, lack firepower and foundation; second, are eager for quick success and profit, unwilling to be lonely, and love to join the crowd; third, are often tired from running around, spiritually tense, and cannot relax; fourth, have strong conformity and dependence, lack self-awareness, often follow the trend, and dare not or are not good at being lonely.

These views may not be entirely accurate, but it is true that some Chinese writers and artists do not have a good understanding of loneliness, do not know how to utilize it, overcome it, and control it. It is no wonder that from the Confucian ideas of harmony between heaven and man, harmonious resonance, group consciousness, and the unity of all under heaven, to today's “collectivism” and the idea of “the group above all else,” these concepts have long permeated the deep structure of the Chinese character. They often only know “we,” but do not know “who I am.” As soon as a person is born, they fall into the network of interpersonal relationships and become an inseparable part of it. First, they cannot cut the “physiological umbilical cord” and depend on their parents for everything in their growth; even when they grow up, they cannot cut the “psychological umbilical cord,” and even after they have established their own families, they still cannot do without their parents, colleagues, and authorities, lacking the ability to live independently.

Without society, a person would find it difficult to survive; but without individuals, human society would also find it difficult to exist. If one insists on doing things one's own way and admiring oneself, such solitude is not desirable; but if there are no independent individuals, the unified group would also cease to exist. Therefore, it is impossible to have solitude that is isolated or opposed to the group. Only by finding one's own path within the group, by striving for humanity's pursuit, forging one's own path, daring to innovate, being good at solitude, and making discoveries and creations, can one say that it is beautiful. I think it is worth cultivating self-respect, self-strength, self-confidence, and self-reliance in solitude, and fostering the beauty of independent thinking, independent action, independence, and innovation.

### “孤独”的奥妙

　　“孤独”的奥妙
    李哲良
    《拜伦传》的作者说：像拜伦那样任性奔逸于无限大宇宙的诗人，是“不能够有他的同行人的”。他独自在幻想和感情的世界中漫游，就连他的父母、妻子和朋友都无法理解他。
    这无疑是悲哀的！所以有人恐惧孤独，诅咒孤独。但从古至今，那些执著的先行者、远行者、独创者和当今的改革者，往往都有过不被理解的遭遇。屈原在汨罗江畔发出的声声叹息，陈子昂在幽州台上发出“前不见古人，后不见来者”的呼号，都在一定程度上道出了“古来贤者皆寂寞”的浓重的孤独感。一个对宇宙和生命麻木不仁的人决不会有此强烈的忧患感、寂寞感和敢于超越时空的独创精神。
    从审美角度看，孤独既是一种处境，又是一种调动“创造潜能”的审美心态。只有忘掉赏罚毁誉，摒弃私心杂念，排除外界干扰，才能使心灵空明、虚静。静则空，“空则灵气往来”，灵感之君方能登堂入室，创造潜能才涓涓涌出。海明威说：“写作，在最成功的时候，是一种孤寂的生涯。”他认为“一个在稠人广众中成长起来的作家，自然可以免除孤苦寂寞之虑，但他的作品往往流于平庸”。因为他往往宥于此时此地的从众意识，不能超越现实时空，对生命和宇宙进行更高层次的独立思考。
    从人格美来看，也极需要甘于寂寞，敢于另辟蹊径，独思独行的品格。也许是旁观者清吧，不少外国学人不客气地指出，当代中国的许多作家艺术家，一是火候、功力不够，底气不足；二是急功好利，不甘寂寞，爱凑热闹；三是长期疲于奔命，精神紧张，不能放松；四是从众性、依附性太强，缺乏自我意识，常常是赶浪头、随大流，不敢也不善于做孤独者。
    这些看法未必合乎实际，但中国的一些作家艺术家不能很好地认识孤独，利用孤独，战胜孤独，驾驭孤独，这确乎是美中不足。也难怪，从儒家的天人合一、和谐共振、合群意识、大一统思想，到今天的“集体主义”和“团体高于一切”的观念，早已渗透到中国人的人格深层结构中了。他们往往只知道“我们”，而不知道“我是谁”。人一生下来就落入到人际关系的网络之中，并成为其中的一个不可分割的连结点。首先是剪不断“生理的脐带”，在成长过程中事事离不开父母；即使长大成人了，也割不断“心理的脐带”，哪怕是已成家立业了，还是处处离不开父母、同事和权威，缺乏独立生活的能力。
    离开了社会，一个人便很难生存；但没有个人，人类社会也难以存在。如果一味地我行我素，孤芳自赏，那这种孤独是不可取的；但假如没有独立的个体，那统一的群体也不复存在。因此，不可能有与群体绝缘或对立的孤独。只有在群体中找到了自己的轨迹，在为人类的追求中冥思苦求，独辟蹊径，敢于独创，善于孤独，而且有所发现，有所创造，这样才可以说是美的。我认为不妨在孤独中造就自尊、自强、自信、自力的人格美，培养独思、独行、独立、独创的精神美。
