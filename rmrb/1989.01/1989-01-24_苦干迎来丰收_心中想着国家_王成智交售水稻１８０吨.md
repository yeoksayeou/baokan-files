	Hard work brings a bountiful harvest, thinking of the country
	Wang Chengzhi sells 180 tons of rice to the state

	XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, January 24, 1989 — Reporter Li Anda reports: Wang Chengzhi, a skilled farmer and Communist Party member from Baoshou Township in Yushu County, Jilin Province, thinks of the country when he harvests a bountiful crop. He is not tempted by high prices and profits, choosing instead to sell 180 tons of rice to the state, even though it means he will earn tens of thousands of yuan less.

	Wang Chengzhi is a well-known farmer in Baoshou Township. In 1985, he took over a loss-making township farm and over three years, he sold hundreds of tons of rice to the state. Last year, he contracted 30 hectares of land, agreeing to sell 500 kilograms of rice per hectare to the state. To ensure a good harvest, Wang Chengzhi invested more than 110,000 yuan to purchase electric irrigation machinery and additional farming and transportation equipment. From planting to harvesting and transportation, he achieved almost full mechanization. He bought high-quality seeds from the provincial agricultural research institute and spent money on expensive fertilizers and diesel. After the autumn harvest, he calculated that each hectare produced 6,250 kilograms of rice.

	Wang Chengzhi had a bountiful harvest. Some units came to his door with cash, offering to buy the rice at 1.4 yuan per kilogram, which is higher than the contract price. After setting aside enough seed and food for his own use, Wang Chengzhi sold the remaining 180 tons of rice to the state grain depot.

　　苦干迎来丰收　心中想着国家    
    王成智交售水稻１８０吨
    本报讯  记者李安达报道：吉林省榆树县保寿乡种田能手、共产党员王成智，丰收想着国家，不为高价重利所动，宁愿自己少收入十几万元，把１８０吨水稻全部卖给国家。
    王成智是保寿乡远近闻名的种田能手。１９８５年，他承包了亏损多年的乡农场，三年交售水稻数百吨。去年他承包３０公顷土地，规定每公顷向国家交售水稻５００公斤。为了夺取丰收，王成智投资１１万多元购买了电力排灌机械，增添了耕作运输机械，从插秧、灌溉到收割、运输，基本上实现机械化；从省农科院购回良种，花钱买高价化肥和柴油。秋收下来一算，每公顷产水稻６２５０公斤。
    王成智丰收了，一些单位带着现金找上门来，要以每公斤１．４元的高价购买定购合同以外的大米。王成智留足种子、口粮等自用粮后，将余下的１８０吨水稻全部卖给国家粮库。
