		17 Units Join Forces to Develop High-Tech Industry
		China Rare Earth Permanent Magnet Entrepreneurial Group Leverages Strengths to Expand Overseas Market

		People's Daily reports: Facing the increasingly fierce competition in the production and application of neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) in the international market, how should China's NdFeB industry develop? The China Rare Earth Permanent Magnet Entrepreneurial Group's answer is: expand cooperation, move towards materialization, and jointly open up the international market.

		NdFeB, which emerged in 1983, is a new material with a very broad application prospect. Currently, China's technological level in this area is on par with that of the United States and Japan, both of which are at the international forefront. From its inception, the China Rare Earth Permanent Magnet Entrepreneurial Group has been closely followed and supported by central and State Council leaders. In less than half a year, the number of member units has grown to 17, including more than 90% of China's key NdFeB production enterprises and related research, financial, and export units. This form is conducive to leveraging China's advantages as a rare earth resource country and a rare earth raw material exporter, and to leveraging the advantages of centralized guidance under socialist conditions. The goal is to gradually move towards a tightly-knit enterprise group with unified coordination in scientific research and development, unified product specifications, unified quality standards, unified trademarks, unified pricing, and unified export channels.

		At the group's general meeting, which concluded on January 14, the China New Technology Venture Investment Corporation, the Chinese Academy of Sciences Three-Ring New Materials Research and Development Company, the Metallurgical Ministry's Baotou Rare Earth Research Institute, the state-owned Jilin 8272 Factory, and the Shanghai Yuelong Chemical Factory were elected as council units.

　　１７个单位合力发展高技术产业
    中国稀土永磁创业集团优势联合开拓海外市场
    本报讯  面对国际市场在钕铁硼生产和应用方面日益剧烈的角逐，中国的钕铁硼产业如何发展？稀土永磁创业集团的答案是：扩大联合，向实体化推进，合力开拓国际市场。
    钕铁硼是１９８３年才问世的具有极广阔应用前景的新材料，目前我国在这方面的技术水平与美国、日本同处国际领先地位。从诞生之初就受到中央和国务院有关领导关心与重视的中国稀土永磁创业集团，不到半年，成员单位就已发展到１７个，包括了国内９０％以上的钕铁硼骨干生产厂家和有关的科研、金融、出口单位。这一形式有利于发挥我国稀土资源国和稀土原料出口国的优势，有利于发挥社会主义条件下集中指导的优势，以逐步向着统一协调科研开发、统一产品规格、统一质量标准、统一商标、统一价格和统一出口渠道的紧密型企业集团的目标迈进。
    在１月１４日结束的集团全体会议上，推举中国新技术创业投资公司、中科院三环新材料研究开发公司、冶金部包头稀土院、吉林国营８２７２厂、上海跃龙化工厂为理事单位。
