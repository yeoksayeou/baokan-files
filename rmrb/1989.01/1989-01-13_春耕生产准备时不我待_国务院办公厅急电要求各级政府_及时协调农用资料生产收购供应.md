Time is of the essence in preparing for spring farming production
The General Office of the State Council urges all levels of government
to promptly coordinate the production, procurement, and supply of agricultural materials

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 12th — The General Office of the State Council today sent an urgent telegram to the people's governments of all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, requiring all localities to thoroughly prepare for the production, procurement, and supply of agricultural materials.

The telegram states that the preparations for spring farming production are imminent. All localities must thoroughly prepare for the production, procurement, and supply of agricultural materials. Production enterprises must actively increase production, business departments must promptly organize procurement and supply, and the People's Bank and the Agricultural Bank must ensure loans for the production and procurement of agricultural materials. All levels of government must promptly coordinate the production, business, and financial supply links of agricultural materials. No link may, for any reason, create obstacles. Otherwise, responsibility will be pursued for any delays. For small chemical fertilizers not allocated by the state, if the supply and marketing cooperatives have difficulties in unified operations, they may, according to the spirit of the State Council's document No. 68 (1988), implement multi-channel operations. Prices will be approved by the county and municipal price departments. Existing cooperative channels may continue to operate legally and should not be disrupted.

　　春耕生产准备时不我待
    国务院办公厅急电要求各级政府
    及时协调农用资料生产收购供应
    新华社北京１月１２日电  国务院办公厅今天向各省、市、自治区人民政府发出急电，要求各地认真做好农用生产资料的生产、收购和供应工作。
    急电说，目前春耕生产准备工作在即，各地要认真做好农用生产资料的生产、收购和供应工作。生产企业要积极增加生产，经营部门要及时组织收购和供应，人民银行、农业银行要保证生产和收购农用生产资料的贷款。各级政府对农用生产资料的生产、经营和资金供应等环节，要及时做好协调，任何环节都不得以任何理由设置障碍。否则，谁误事追究谁的责任。对非国家统一分配的小化肥，如供销社统一经营有困难，可根据国务院国发（１９８８）６８号文件精神，实行多渠道放开经营，其价格由县市物价部门审定，原有的协作渠道仍可依法照常进行，不要中断。
