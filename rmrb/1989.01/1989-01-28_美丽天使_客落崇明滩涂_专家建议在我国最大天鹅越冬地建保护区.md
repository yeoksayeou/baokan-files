Ornithological experts announced the other day that the eastern coastal mudflats of Tuanjie Sha and Dongwang Sha in Chongming County, Shanghai, are home to the largest wintering habitat for wild swans in China.

Since 1987, every autumn around October, approximately 3,700 swans fly to Chongming to spend the winter; the following spring in March, they gradually fly north to the Hulunbuir Grasslands in Inner Mongolia to breed. The number of wild swans wintering in Chongming has surpassed those in the Jiangsu Yancheng Nature Reserve and the Jiangxi Poyang Lake Nature Reserve.

Experts, through observation and research, have discovered that the swans wintering here are of the Bewick's swan species. The reason they choose the eastern Chongming mudflats for their habitat is that Bewick's swans love to eat the tubers of the sea arrowgrass found here.

Local farmers have previously used pesticides to kill birds. Experts appeal: relevant departments should promptly establish a nature reserve in this swan habitat, formulate regional nature conservation regulations, and keep these beautiful angels visiting Shanghai.

　　“美丽天使”客落崇明滩涂    
    专家建议在我国最大天鹅越冬地建保护区
    本报上海１月２７日电  鸟类研究专家前天宣布，上海市崇明县东部的团结沙、东旺沙一带沿海滩涂，发现了我国最大的野生天鹅越冬栖息地。
    １９８７年以来，每年秋初１０月有３７００只左右的天鹅飞来崇明越冬；次年初春３月，陆续北飞内蒙古呼伦贝尔草原繁殖。在崇明越冬的野生天鹅数已超过了江苏盐城自然保护区和江西鄱阳湖自然保护区同类天鹅数。
    专家们经过观察研究发现，飞到这里越冬的是小天鹅种。之所以选择崇明东郊滩涂栖息，是因为小天鹅爱吃这里的海三棱藨草的球茎。
    此地农民曾用农药药鸟。专家们呼吁：有关部门应尽快在这片天鹅栖息地建立自然保护区，制订地区性自然保护法规，留住这群飞临大上海的美丽天使。
