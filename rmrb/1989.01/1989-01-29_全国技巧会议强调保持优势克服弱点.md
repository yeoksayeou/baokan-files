The national gymnastics conference emphasized maintaining strengths and overcoming weaknesses.

New China News Agency, Beijing, January 28 (Reporter Bì Jìng) – The director of the State Sports Commission, Wǔ Shào Zǔ, met with gymnastics professionals attending the national gymnastics training work conference here yesterday. He pointed out: "Gymnastics is one of China's strong sports. We should pour our hearts into this cause, not be concerned with personal gains and losses, have a spirit of dedication, and manage the team well to improve the athletes' cultural level."

When the president of the Chinese Gymnastics Association, Zhāng Sù Zhōng, reported that gymnastics would be included as a demonstration event in the next Olympics, Wǔ Shào Zǔ agreed to include gymnastics as a demonstration event in the 1990 Beijing Asian Games. He also said that the 7th National Games plans to include 25 Olympic events, and additionally, gymnastics, women's baseball, and wushu, three non-Olympic events, will also be included. Non-Olympic events entering the National Games have two conditions: one is that they have the potential to become Olympic events in the near future, and the other is that they are China's strong sports. Of course, this issue still needs to be finalized at the March meeting of the National Sports Commission. Wǔ Shào Zǔ praised the practice of maintaining a high level through short-term training camps each year to leverage collective advantages.

The national gymnastics conference began on the 25th and concluded today. Nearly 50 gymnastics professionals from 26 units across the country participated in this conference. The conference summarized the experiences of Chinese athletes achieving good results in last year's World Championships, affirming the policy of not forming a national team but leveraging the enthusiasm of provinces and cities through training camps. In training, it is necessary to strengthen the work of joint teams from various provinces and cities, to develop unique skills and focus on small technical movements, and to break through the weak links in the mixed doubles event. The conference believed that it is necessary to adjust, replenish, and revitalize the work of the gymnastics association, changing the past situation where "those who are listed do not do the work, and those who do the work are not listed."

　　全国技巧会议强调保持优势克服弱点
    新华社北京１月２８日电（记者毕靖）国家体委主任伍绍祖昨天会见正在这里参加全国技巧训练工作会议的技巧界人士时指出：“技巧是我国的优势项目，我们要满腔热情地把心血浇注在事业上，不要计较个人得失，要有献身精神，要把运动队的管理工作抓好，提高运动员的文化素养。”
    当中国技巧协会主席张素央汇报说，技巧将被列为下届奥运会表演项目时，伍绍祖赞成把技巧列为明年北京亚运会的表演项目。他还说，第七届全运会打算列入２５个奥运会项目，另外，技巧、女垒和武术三个非奥运会项目也将被列入。非奥运会项目进入全运会有两个条件，一是近期有可能成为奥运会项目，二是我国的优势项目。当然，这个问题还要等３月的全国体委主任会议最后定板。伍绍祖对技巧项目每年通过短期集训，发挥集体优势以保持高水平的做法表示赞赏。
    全国技巧会议是从２５日开始的，已于今天结束。来自全国２６个单位的近５０名技巧界人士参加了这次会议。会议总结了我国选手在去年世界锦标赛上取得好成绩的经验，肯定了不搞国家队而通过集训和发挥全国各省市积极性的方针；在训练上要加强各省市联合组队工作，要出绝招、抓小技巧动作，要突破混双项目等薄弱环节。会议认为，必须调整、充实、搞活技巧协会工作，要改变过去“挂名的不干事，干事的不挂名”的局面。
