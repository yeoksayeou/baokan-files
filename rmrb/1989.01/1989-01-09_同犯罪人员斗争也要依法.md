In recent years, in some rural areas, especially in remote mountainous regions, a few farmers have captured lawbreakers and criminals but instead of handing them over to the public security and judicial authorities for legal processing, they have set up their own "courts." In some places, the situation has even escalated to the point where the public has beaten criminals to death or caused them serious injuries.

This reflects several issues: First, legal education in some rural areas is not thorough or comprehensive. Some people equate legal education with just arresting people, sentencing them, and fining them, only telling the public how to "behave properly" without educating them on how to use the law to protect their legal rights and fight against illegal and criminal activities. Therefore, some people mistakenly believe that beating a bad person to death is not illegal. Second, some grassroots party and government officials, as well as public security and judicial departments, do not handle general criminal and public security cases promptly and seriously. Some people believe that handing criminals over to judicial authorities will not necessarily result in serious punishment, so they take simple and extreme actions to "vent their anger." Third, some public security and judicial authorities not only do not take effective measures to stop incidents where the public beats people or even beats them to death, but also mistakenly view this phenomenon as a sign that the public dares to fight against illegal and criminal activities.

Such incidents are not difficult to prevent and eliminate. For example, legal education in rural areas should be conducted thoroughly to make farmers understand that fighting against illegal and criminal activities must also be strictly conducted in accordance with the law. Law enforcement agencies and officers should strictly distinguish between cases where criminals are beaten to death by individuals and cases where the public dares to fight against criminal activities. They should recognize that beating criminals to death or causing them serious injuries is also an illegal and criminal act, and should be dealt with seriously in a timely manner, even to the extent of holding them criminally responsible. Third, public security and judicial authorities should promptly handle cases involving suspects or crimes reported or handed over by the public. Only in this way can we both encourage the public to fight against illegal and criminal activities and educate them to avoid using illegal and criminal means to deal with lawbreakers and criminals.

### 同犯罪人员斗争也要依法

　　同犯罪人员斗争也要依法
    周宪昌
    近几年，在一些农村，特别是一些边远山区，少数农民抓获违法犯罪人员以后，不是送交公安、司法机关依法处理，而是私设“公堂”，个别地方甚至发生群众打死致残违法犯罪人员的事情。
    这反映出几个问题：一是部分农村普法教育不够深入、全面。有的人把法制讲成好像就是抓人、判刑、罚款，只告诉群众怎样“安分守己”，而不教育群众学会怎样运用法律保护自己的合法权益，依法同违法犯罪行为作斗争。所以，有些群众错误地认为，打死坏人不算违法；二是一些基层党政干部、公安司法部门，对一般刑事案件、治安案件的处理不及时、不认真。一些群众认为把犯罪分子交给司法机关处理不一定会给予严肃处理，便采取简单过激的行动来“消气”；三是有的公安、司法机关对群众乱打人甚至打死人的事件，不仅不采取有效措施加以制止，反而错误地把这种现象看作是群众敢于同违法犯罪活动作斗争的表现。
    这类事件不难预防和杜绝，例如，深入进行农村普法教育，让农民懂得同违法犯罪行为作斗争也必须严格依法进行；执法机关和干警严格区分擅自打死违法犯罪人员的事件同群众敢于同犯罪活动作斗争的界限，认识随意打死、致残违法犯罪人员，同样是违法犯罪行为，及时给予严肃处理，直至追究其刑事责任。第三，公安、司法机关对人民群众扭送或举报的人犯或案件，应及时查处。只有这样，才能既鼓舞群众同违法犯罪行为作斗争，又教育群众避免采用违法犯罪的办法对待违法犯罪人员。
