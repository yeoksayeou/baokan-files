NEW YORK, Jan. 8 (Xinhua) — The Libyan foreign minister said today that his country currently has no plans or technology to produce chemical weapons, but he did not rule out the possibility that Libya might produce such weapons in the future.

The United States has labeled this pharmaceutical factory as a chemical weapons production plant and threatened to destroy it.

TUNIS, Jan. 8 (Xinhua) — According to the Libyan News Agency, Libya organized a group of foreign journalists to visit the Rabta Pharmaceutical Factory in the city of Gariyan, which has caused tension in U.S.-Libyan relations.

The report said that during the visit, the factory director gave the journalists a detailed introduction to the pharmaceutical production process. The journalists, after visiting various production workshops in the factory, could confirm that it is indeed a pharmaceutical factory.
