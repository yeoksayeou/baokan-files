To the Editor:

On December 11th of last year, which was a Sunday, Dr. Zhang Yanhong arrived at our home from the distant city of Taiyuan in Shanxi Province, bringing good news for my ailing husband.

My husband is an engineer, only 43 years old. Last September, he was diagnosed with late-stage liver cirrhosis. We visited almost every major hospital in the city, but the response was always the same: there was no cure.

On October 4th of last year, we saw a report about Dr. Zhang Yanhong from the Public Security Bureau of Shanxi Province in the fourth edition of the People's Daily. We decided to seek his help.

On December 6th of last year, I took the article from the People's Daily and my husband's medical records to Taiyuan to find Dr. Zhang. Dr. Zhang agreed to come to our home for a house call the following Sunday. On December 11th and 25th, Dr. Zhang came to our home twice for treatment, and my husband's condition improved. Dr. Zhang traveled thousands of miles to provide medical care at our doorstep, and our entire family was deeply moved.

Beijing, Zhang Qinmei

　　张医生是个好党员
    编辑同志：
    去年１２月１１日是星期天。风尘仆仆的张雁鹏大夫从千里之外的山西太原来到了我们家，给我患病的丈夫带来了福音。
    我爱人是一位工程师，才４３岁。去年９月，被确诊为晚期肝硬变。市内大医院几乎都跑遍了，得到的回答是：无法医治。
    去年１０月４日，我们从人民日报第四版上看到关于武警山西总队医院张雁鹏医生的报道，决定向他求助。
    去年１２月６日，我带着人民日报那篇文章和我爱人的病历，在太原找到了张医生。张医生答应下个星期天到我家出诊。１２月１１日、２５日，张医生两次来到我们家治疗，我丈夫的病情已好转。张医生千里送医上门，我们全家深受感动。
