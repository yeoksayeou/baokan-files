The selection of the new head coach for the national men's basketball team has been a topic of great interest. Many people are puzzled: How did the relatively unknown coach of the Nanjing Army Men's Basketball Team, Sun Bang, come to replace the renowned coach, Qian Chenghai?

The "fast, accurate, agile" strategy of Chinese basketball is well-known. However, Sun Bang's unique approach lies in his creative implementation of this strategy, making the Nanjing Army Men's Basketball Team stand out with a distinctive style and charm both domestically and internationally.

Ten years ago, Sun Bang took over as the coach of the Nanjing Army Men's Basketball Team. Selecting talent for the army team is more challenging than for local teams, and the average height of the players was only 1.89 meters, making them the shortest among the top teams in the country. However, Sun Bang did not despair. He aimed to create miracles in "fast, accurate, agile" play. To emphasize speed, he demanded high physical fitness from his players during full-court, 40-minute intense battles. Additionally, he added the element of "endurance" to the "fast, accurate, agile" strategy. He emphasized, "Endurance is willpower, it is character, it is the ability to withstand fatigue and not be defeated. When both teams are exhausted in the final minute, it all comes down to this 'endurance'!"

After a decade of silent exploration and innovation, he transformed an unremarkable second-tier team into a formidable "army champion," winning the national championship in 1987. The Nanjing Army Men's Basketball Team had the best physical fitness in the country. In 1987, the seven best men's basketball teams in the country gathered in Zhengzhou for a training camp and physical fitness test, and the Nanjing Army Men's Basketball Team ranked first.

The Nanjing Army Men's Basketball Team's fast, agile, and accurate technical style, combined with their tenacious fighting spirit, caught the attention of international basketball circles. In 1982, the famous American All-Star Team visited China and played three games. The national men's basketball team lost both the first and second games by more than 20 points. In the final game, Sun Bang led the Nanjing Army Men's Basketball Team in Shanghai to face the American All-Star Team. Despite the height disadvantage, the Nanjing Army players fearlessly pressed the entire court, moving quickly and accurately, fully showcasing their "fast, accurate, agile, and enduring" style. The final score was 94:104, with a difference of only 10 points! The Shanghai basketball community was amazed and praised this game as the best they had seen in over 30 years since the founding of the nation. After the game, at the banquet in the Jinjiang Hotel, the captain of the American All-Star Team exclaimed, "This game was the best of the three we played. I never expected the Nanjing Army to have such a fantastic basketball team. The Nanjing Army is the true Chinese team."

Over a decade, Sun Bang led the Nanjing Army Men's Basketball Team to compete against teams from more than 20 countries, including the Soviet Union, Poland, Italy, France, Colombia, and Australia. His extensive exposure to various styles of the international basketball scene has brought him to a mature stage in his coaching career.

Recently, after reluctantly handing over the coaching duties of the Nanjing Army Men's Basketball Team, he began to formulate his overall plan for the new national men's basketball team at home. He said, "Basketball is not just about height; it is also about speed and technique. Since the Chinese team does not have an advantage in height, the only way forward is to focus on 'fast, accurate, and agile' play, putting in a lot of effort and coming up with new strategies. Based on this style, my criteria for selecting national team players are: strong awareness, fast speed, and tough spirit. Once the official order from the army comes, I will head north to report and present my ideas to my predecessors, Qian Chenghai and Yang Bozhen, seeking their opinions. However, those who know me understand that I do not like to follow others' paths. I prefer to find my own way, and once I set a goal, I will stick to it!"

　　十年求索创风格
    ——记国家男篮新任主教练孙邦
    众所瞩目的国家男篮主教练人选爆出了冷门。很多人都感到不解：名不见经传的南京部队男篮教练孙邦，凭什么接替赫赫有名的钱澄海教练。
    中国篮球的“快、准、灵”方针，尽人皆知，然而，孙邦与众不同之处，则在于创造性地贯彻此方针，使南部男篮在国内国际篮坛上越来越鲜明地展示出独特的风格与魅力。
    １０年前，孙邦出任南京部队男篮教练。部队选才比地方队困难，队员平均身高只有１．８９米，在全国篮坛劲旅中，个头排在最尾。然而，孙邦没有叹息，他要在“快、准、灵”上创造奇迹。为了体现快，在全场２４米大范围与强手进行长达４０分钟的激烈争夺，他一方面对队员的身体素质训练提出高要求，另一方面，又在“快、准、灵”三字方针中加入一个“韧”字。他强调说：“韧，是意志、是品质、是拖不垮、打不烂的战斗作风。当双方精疲力尽地激战到最后一分钟时，就看这个‘韧’字了！”
    经过１０年默默无闻的探索与独创，他终于把一支不起眼的乙级队雕琢成为一支威震全军的“军中王”，并于１９８７年雄冠全国篮坛。南部男篮身体素质是全国第一流的。１９８７年，全国最优秀的七支男篮集训郑州，进行素质测验，南部男篮名列第一。
    南部男篮快速、灵活、准确的技术型风格与坚韧顽强的战斗作风，使国际篮坛人士刮目相看。１９８２年，名扬全球的美国全明星队访华，共打三场球。第一、二场球，国家男篮迎战客队，都输了２０分以上。最后一场球，孙邦奉命率南京部队男篮在上海迎战客队。面对高大的美国全明星队，南部健儿毫不畏惧，全场紧逼，快进快退，把“快、准、灵、韧”的风格发挥得淋漓尽致，颇有气势。终场锣响，９４∶１０４，南部的差距仅１０分！被轰动的上海篮球界称赞这场球是建国３０多年来所看到的最好的一场篮球赛。赛罢，在锦江饭店的宴会上，美国全明星队团长赞叹说，“这场球，是我们三场球中打得最好的一场球，想不到南京部队还有这么一支漂亮的男篮。南部队，是真正的中国队。”
    十度春秋，孙邦率南部男篮与苏联、波兰、意大利、法国、哥伦比亚、澳大利亚等２０多个国家队交过锋。对世界篮坛各种风格的广泛接触和了解，使年近半百的孙邦步入篮坛执教生涯的成熟期。
    近日，他依依不舍地交出了南部男篮的教鞭之后，就开始在家中酝酿国家新男篮的总体构思。他说：“篮球，不光是高度的竞争，更是速度与技术的竞争。既然中国队在高度上不具备优势，那么，唯一的出路，就只有在“快、准、灵”上下大功夫，花大力气，出新招数。根据上述风格，我挑选国家队员的标准是：意识强、速度快、作风硬。等部队正式命令下来，我就北上报到，把我的构思与设想，向钱澄海、杨伯镛等前辈汇报，征求他们的意见。不过，了解我性格的人都知道，我不习惯走别人的老路，我喜欢自己摸索，一旦看准了目标，我将坚持走下去！”
