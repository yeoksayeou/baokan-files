Title: Tricks to Get Money from Above, Relationships to Allocate Money Below

I once served as the secretary of a township party committee. Due to the limited financial resources of the township, to help the local people get rich and prosperous as quickly as possible, I had to seek funds from higher authorities. Some township cadres with connections could obtain funds, but I had neither backing nor connections, so I kept hitting a wall. To get the funds, I wrote reports to higher authorities and made trips to relevant departments, but the results were minimal. Later, I adopted the tactic of not leaving until I got the money, and this strategy worked to some extent, but only for a short time. As I saw and heard more, my tricks for getting money from above increased. I adopted the strategy of "to take, one must first give," sending tea, tea oil, and citrus fruits, among other local specialties, to relevant personnel. This method was much more effective than writing reports or refusing to leave. However, there are many tricks to sending gifts; if not handled properly, it could all be in vain.

Although I gave some people gifts, I felt very uncomfortable doing so. The Party and the government have given certain units and personnel some authority, but they have misused it, turning it into a means for personal gain. I also know that what I did was wrong, but if I didn't do it, I couldn't get the money, and starting the anti-poverty efforts would be difficult. To help the local people get rich as soon as possible, I had to reluctantly give some people gifts.

Currently, the country is carrying out a campaign to improve the economic environment and rectify economic order, which gives me hope. I believe that relevant departments must take decisive measures to stop this bad practice; otherwise, it will be detrimental to the country and the people and seriously damage the Party's image among the masses.

### 向上要钱窍门多　向下拨钱看关系

　　向上要钱窍门多
  　向下拨钱看关系
    我曾担任过乡党委书记。由于乡财政收入有限，为尽快使乡亲们脱贫致富，我只好向上级要钱。一些有关系的乡干部能要到钱，而我一无靠山，二无关系，便连连碰壁。为了能要到钱，我向上级写报告，一趟一趟地往有关部门跑，但效果甚微。后来，我采取了要不到钱就赖着不走的办法，这一招真有点效果，但只灵了一时。随着我看到的听到的多了，我向上面要钱的“窍门”也就多起来了，我采取了“将欲取之，必先予之”的办法，给有关人员送些茶叶、茶油、柑桔等土特产品。这一办法比写报告、赖着不走等办法强多了。送东西也有许多窍门，如稍稍掌握不当，也会竹篮打水一场空。
    我虽然给一些人送了些东西，但心里是挺别扭的。党和政府给了一些单位和有关人员一些权力，却被他们滥用了，变成了他们谋取私利的“资本”。我也知道，我这样做是不对的，但是不这样做，就要不到钱，治穷起步就困难了。为了乡亲们能尽快富裕起来，我只好违心地给一些人送点东西。
    目前，全国正在开展治理经济环境，整顿经济秩序的工作，使我看到了希望。我认为，有关部门必须采取果断措施，制止这种不良现象，否则，实在于国于民不利，严重损害党在群众中的形象。
