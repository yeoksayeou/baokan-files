Peking Opera: An Art in Development
– Reflections on the "New Peking Opera Repertoire Showcase"
Zhang Geng

	“The setting sun is beautiful, but it is near the end of the day.” Some say this is a description of the current state of Peking Opera, implying that while it is exquisite, it is aging and about to fade from history. At the same time, some within the Peking Opera community advocate that, having undergone over a hundred years of development, it has reached a state of perfect artistry, and that performing traditional plays is sufficient. They believe that it should only be performed in the traditional manner. These two views, though diametrically opposed, both agree on one point: that Peking Opera cannot be innovated or developed. This is where they converge, in a strange harmony.

	However, after watching the "New Peking Opera Repertoire Showcase" in Tianjin, I felt very excited. The Peking Opera practitioners showed us the fruits of their arduous efforts over the years, proving with facts that Peking Opera can communicate with the times and the people, that it will not decline but is full of vitality, and that it is still in the process of development. The successful experiments in Peking Opera reform have left the two aforementioned viewpoints behind in reality.

	Peking Opera must continue to innovate and cannot cling to the old. This is an irresistible trend of development. However, the question of how to innovate, or to what extent, is one that we must address. To answer this question scientifically, we must study the laws of Peking Opera and even of traditional Chinese opera. Generally speaking, the laws of traditional Chinese opera include its narrative, musical, and dance elements, all of which must be integrated into a rhythm. The primary standard for distinguishing between different forms of traditional Chinese opera is their unique musical characteristics. The distinctive singing style of Peking Opera is what sets it apart from other forms. The reform and development of Peking Opera must follow this law and cannot violate it. However, this does not mean that it is eternally unchanged; development is change. In the showcase play "Cao Cao and Yang Xu," the use of the Yan school's old-style singing style is itself an evolution from the Tan school. In the play, it undergoes new changes. To express the new character and ideological depth of Yang Xu, the primary means of expression, the singing style, must also develop and change. In the innovation of Yang Xu's singing style, the designers still relied on the basic rhythm (patterns) of Peking Opera's old-style singing.

	True art is open. Traditional Chinese opera does not reject the absorption of new methods and techniques of expression. From the showcase plays, it is clear that Peking Opera is the same. For example, in the second scene of "Cao Cao and Yang Xu," the scriptwriting technique uses methods from other performing arts such as "flashback" and "stream of consciousness" to depict Cao Cao's psychological process of wanting to kill Kong Wende. However, in the second creation of the directing, it harmoniously uses the typical Peking Opera traditional performance routines of "acting" and "fighting" to complete the scene, without any sense of obsolescence. Another example is in "Hong Kong Journey," where Mei Wei pours out her bitter experiences to her lover, whom she has not seen in ten years, in a nightclub. The creators abandoned the usual practice of arranging a long singing section in such a situation and instead used a segment of modern dance full of emotional color to express it. However, the playwright did not use a time-switching flashback but instead used the traditional direct narration of traditional Chinese opera, which more accurately expressed the protagonist's indescribable anguish at that moment and place.

	The above two examples may illustrate a principle: Peking Opera art must express contemporary people's thoughts and consciousness and meet contemporary people's aesthetic needs. It must either excavate or expand the themes. To express new content, the form must absorb and innovate, breaking through the original established routines, but it must be appropriate.

	According to this reasoning, two questions arise.

	First, is the routine of traditional Chinese opera a law, and can it be changed? I believe that the routine is not equivalent to the law of traditional Chinese opera itself; it is merely a manifestation of the law of traditional Chinese opera in the development of traditional Chinese opera art. Therefore, the routine presents a relatively stable state in a certain stage of traditional Chinese opera development, but in the long river of traditional Chinese opera development, it is absolutely changing. From this perspective, the routine can be changed and broken through.

	The second question is: how much innovation is appropriate? In addition to not violating the law of Peking Opera development, the main consideration should be that Peking Opera cannot be separated from the audience. Drama must be created through literature, stage, and audience, and all three are indispensable. Whether it is the first creation or the second creation, it must obtain the understanding of the object it serves and the participant in artistic creation—the audience. It must touch their heartstrings, making them tremble, be intoxicated, and imagine, entering the realm of creation. If a play, after the two creations of literature and stage performance, still cannot convey information and symbols to the audience that they can understand, resulting in the third creation not being effectively realized, then the entire process of traditional Chinese opera art creation would be interrupted and fail. How to guide the audience to understand the signals that the artist wants to convey to them is the key to the success or failure of the drama. As a performed traditional Chinese opera, it must not be too far from the aesthetic habits of the majority of the audience you choose. Being too far ahead or behind is not wise. The best connection between the first and second creations and the third creation is to continuously follow the progress of the times on the premise that the audience can keep up.

	Over nearly a thousand years of Chinese traditional Chinese opera and over a hundred years of Peking Opera art, a complete set of aesthetic laws has been formed in practice. However, to this day, their artistic means of expression have not yet reached the perfect state of fully embodying these laws. Therefore, traditional Chinese opera, and even its most representative form—Peking Opera, are still in the process of development and have not reached a state of extreme aging. This is one of the reasons why plays like "Hongmang Great Rift" appeared in this showcase. It has vigorously grown from the mother body of Peking Opera, powerfully impacting our traditional taboos, and even some basic laws. Its appearance, on the one hand, shows us the vitality of Peking Opera, and on the other hand, it causes us to be shocked. This shock is meaningful enough to make us think deeply.

	In summary, the practice of Peking Opera practitioners has proven that Peking Opera art is expanding its expressive power day by day; it is overcoming our narrow-mindedness day by day, including that of artists and audiences; it has proven that Peking Opera art is steadily moving towards a more perfect future.

　　京剧：发展中的艺术
    ——“京剧新剧目汇演”观感
    张庚
    “夕阳无限好，只是近黄昏。”有人说这是京剧艺术目前景况的写照，意思是说，它虽然精美，但已衰老，行将退出历史。同时京剧界本身有一些人主张，它历经百多年的发展，已达到完美的艺术境界，仅演传统戏就很好，而且只能按老样子演。这里虽然表现出了两种绝然不同的意见，一为消亡论，以为它是隔代之物，完全丧失了生机；一为勿动论，认为它是传世之宝，一动就要破坏传统。而仔细分析这两种意见，则在京剧艺术不能革新、不能发展这点上达到了“契合”，有异曲同工之妙。
    但这次在天津观看“京剧新剧目汇演”，使我感到很兴奋，京剧工作者向我们展示了近年来艰苦求索而获得的成果，他们以事实向我们证明了，京剧艺术可以同时代、同民众息息相通，它非但不会衰亡，并且充满了生机，它尚处在发展过程中。京剧革新的成功实验，使上面谈到的两种论点落到了实际后面。
    京剧要继续革新，不能抱残守缺，这是不可遏止的发展趋势。但怎样革新，或者说新到什么程度，则是摆在我们面前的课题。为了较为科学地解答这个问题，就要研究京剧乃至戏曲的规律。一般来讲戏曲的规律，是它的故事性、音乐性和舞蹈性，而这一切都需归结到节奏上。区分戏曲剧种的最主要的标准，就是它们所具备的不同的音乐特征。京剧所特有的音乐唱腔是它有别于其他剧种的本质特征，京剧的革新与发展要依着这条规律前进，而不能违背它。但是，这绝不意味着它永恒不变，发展就是变。在“汇演”剧目《曹操与杨修》中，运用的言派老生唱腔，其原本就是从谭派发展演变而来的，在《曹》剧中又有了新变化。要表现剧本所揭示的杨修——这一人物新的性格和思想底蕴，其主要表现手段之一的唱腔，就需有发展与变化。而在杨修的唱腔创新中，设计者所依据的仍是京剧老生唱腔的基本节奏（板式）。
    真正的艺术是开放性的。戏曲从不拒绝吸收新的表现方法和技巧，从“汇演”的剧目看，京剧也如此。譬如《曹操与杨修》第二场的编剧手法，使用了其他表演艺术“闪回”、“意识流”等方法，来写曹操欲杀孔文岱的心理过程；而在二度创作的导演处理上，却和谐地运用了典型的京剧传统“做”与“打”的表演程式来完成，并无陈旧感。又如《香港行》中，麦薇在夜总会向离散十年的恋人倾吐自己的辛酸经历。创作者放弃了通常在这样的情境中安排大段唱腔的作法，而是借用一段极富感情色彩的现代舞厅舞去表述；但剧作者又没有去作转换时间的倒叙，恰恰是以戏曲传统的直述，更贴切地表达了此时此地剧中人物千言万语也说不尽的苦衷。
    以上两例可否说明一个道理，即京剧艺术既要表现当代人的思想意识，符合当代人的审美需求，就要在题材内涵上或开掘、或拓展；为了表现新的内涵，在形式上就一定要有所吸取、有所创新，从而突破原本形成的程式，只不过要恰当而已。
    依照这样的说法，便出现了两个问题。
    一是，戏曲程式是不是规律，能不能改变？我以为，程式并不能等同于戏曲规律本身，它只不过仅仅是戏曲规律性在戏曲艺术发展中的表现形式。所以，程式在戏曲某一发展阶段中呈相对的稳定状态，而在戏曲发展的长河中，却是在绝对地变化着。由此看来，程式是可以被改变和突破的。
    第二个问题是：怎样革新才算适度？除了不能违反京剧的发展规律外，主要应该考虑的是，京剧不能脱离观众。戏剧要经过文学、舞台、观众三方面的创造才能完成它的艺术效果，三者缺一不可。无论是一度创作还是二度创作，都需取得它所服务的对象和艺术创造的参予者——观众的理解，打动他们的心弦，使之战栗、沉醉、浮想联翩，进入创造的境地。如果一出戏经过文学和舞台演出这两度创作后，向观众所发出的信息、符号尚不能为他们所理解，而致使第三度创作不能有效地出现，那么，整个戏曲艺术创造过程就归于中断与失败了。如何引导观众，使之理解艺术家所要传达给他们的信号，是戏剧成功或失败的关键。作为演出的戏曲，一定不能脱离你所选择的大多数观众的欣赏习惯太远，过于超前或落后都是不明智的。一度、二度创作与第三度创作的最佳衔接是在观众跟得上的前提下，不断追随着时代前进。
    近千年来的中国戏曲及百余年来的京剧艺术，在实践中形成了一整套美学规律，但至今为止，它们的艺术表现手段，并没有达到充分体现这些规律的完美境地。所以说，戏曲乃至它最具代表性的剧种——京剧，都尚处在发展过程之中，并没有到某种极致的程度而面临衰老。这就是在这次“汇演”中出现了诸如《洪荒大裂变》这样的剧目的原因之一，它从京剧的母体中蓬勃地生长出来，有力地冲击了我们视之为传统的戒律，甚至也冲击了一些基本规律。它的出现一方面向我们显示了京剧的生命力，一方面引起了我们的震动，这种震动的意义是足以引起我们深思的。
    总之，京剧工作者们的实践，证明了京剧艺术在一天天扩大表现力；在一天天克服我们（包括艺术家与观众）的狭隘眼光；证明了京剧艺术正坚定地走向更完美的未来。
