	Decision-Maker
	—A Record of the Director of the 16th Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, Zhong Yibiao

	Wang Liwu

	In early 1984, the original Railway Corps collectively transferred from the military to civilian work, and Zhong Yibiao changed from a division commander to a bureau director.

	A force of 1.5 million people was scattered across five provinces and cities. Of the five engineering departments under his command, three had no work, and the annual plan was to lose 2.3 million yuan. Moreover, the enterprise that had just taken off its military uniform was like a newlywed daughter-in-law who had just separated from her mother-in-law, with no pots, pans, bowls, or basins. They had to buy land, build houses, find jobs for family members, and send children to school. Tens of thousands of mouths needed to be fed... All of this weighed heavily on Zhong Yibiao's shoulders.

	What was surprising was that in 1985, the year after the transition, the 16th Bureau completed an investment of 235 million yuan and realized a profit of 15 million yuan, more than doubling the 1984 figure. Following that, in 1986 and 1987, the completed investments both exceeded two billion yuan, and the realized profits were both above 15 million yuan. The construction projects changed from having only one mandatory task to increasing to 36 items through bidding and tendering.

	As the first manager of the enterprise, Zhong Yibiao had a far-sighted vision. In early 1984, as soon as the team was assigned to the national key project—the Daqin Line, he realized that the mandatory task of "big pot of rice" could not be sustained. He then researched with other leaders to establish task-contracting leading groups at the bureau and department levels, specifically assigning a deputy director to be responsible, and determining the principle that as long as it was profitable, they would take on the work, whether it was inside or outside the line, far or near, and regardless of the investment amount. They also established information networks in North China and East China, and trained bidding personnel. Because this work was grasped early and tightly, in the first bidding organized by the Ministry of Railways for the Daqin Line Chaishi section, with 9 units participating in the competition, the 16th Bureau won the bid with the highest score. In recent years, except for the Daqin Line Yangzhang section being a mandatory task, the 16th Bureau has secured tasks worth about 200 million yuan each year, basically ensuring that the team has work to do.

	The opportunities that society provides for enterprises to compete are equal, but these opportunities are also fleeting. Zhong Yibiao is good at searching for opportunities and capturing information in the complex competitive situation, daring to take risks, and making decisions when necessary. In November 1985, the temporary railway line change tunnel project for the Fuzhou Water Reservoir in Fujian Province was put out to bid. This was a Sino-foreign joint venture project with a tight schedule, heavy tasks, and significant influence. The colleagues from the 16th Bureau who participated in the bidding were concerned about the high requirements and low bid price, fearing that they might lose money, and planned to give up the task with a high bid. After learning of this information, Zhong Yibiao immediately rushed to Fujian to conduct a detailed on-site inspection. After investigation, he felt that although taking on this task had risks, the quality of the tunnel rock was good, the amount of auxiliary work was small, and they had advanced tunnel construction machinery and experience in tunnel construction. There was still a good chance of completing the task on time, so he decisively decided to do everything possible to win the bid. In the end, they successfully secured the task with a reasonable bid price. As a result, a half-team from the 2nd Department, along with some civilian workers, completed the 1,300-meter tunnel construction task in 7 months, handing over a fully qualified project, and making a profit of over 2 million yuan.

　　决策者
    ——记铁道部第１６工程局局长钟以彪
    王立武
    １９８４年初，原铁道兵部队集体转业兵改工，钟以彪由师长变成了局长。
    １．５万人的队伍，分散在５个省市，下属５个工程处有３个没活干，年计划亏损２３０万元。况且，刚脱下军装的企业就像刚和婆婆分家的小媳妇，锅、碗、瓢、盆一无所有，买地、盖房、家属就业、子女上学，几万张嘴要吃饭……这一切，重重地压在了钟以彪的肩上。
    令人刮目相看的是，改工后的１９８５年，１６局完成投资２．３５亿元，实现利润１５００万，比１９８４年翻了１番多。紧接着，１９８６年、１９８７两年完成投资均突破两个亿，实现利润都在１５００万元以上；施工项目由原来只有１项指令性任务，变成靠投标招标陡增到３６项。
    作为企业的第一管理者，钟以彪颇具远见。１９８４年初，队伍刚刚拉上国家重点工程——大秦线，他就意识到指令性任务这碗“大锅饭”是吃不长的，便与其他领导研究成立局、处两级承揽任务领导小组，专门分工一名副局长负责，确定了不管路内路外，距离远近，投资多少，只要划得来就干的原则，并在华北、华东建立了信息网络，培训了投标人员。由于对这项工作抓得早、抓得紧，在铁道部第一次组织的９个单位参加竞争的大秦线茶石段工程投标中，１６局以最高分一举中标。近几年，除了大秦线阳张段是指令性任务外，１６局每年自己揽到的任务都在２亿元左右，基本保证了队伍有活干。
    社会给企业提供的竞争机会是均等的，但是这种时机又是稍纵即逝的。钟以彪善于在错综复杂的竞争形势中搜寻机会，捕捉信息，敢冒风险，当断则断。１９８５年１１月，福建省水口电站铁路临时改线隧道工程招标，这是一项中外合资项目，工期紧，任务重，影响大，１６局参加投标的同志担心要求高，标价低，可能亏本，打算以高报价把任务让出去。钟以彪得知这一信息后，立即赶到福建，对现场进行仔细勘察。经过调查，他感到担负这项任务虽然有风险，但这座隧道石质好，附属工程量小，自己有钻孔台车和其它先进隧道施工机械，队伍又有打隧道的经验，按期完成的把握还是有的，于是他果断决定，要想尽一切办法中标。最后，终于以合理标价揽回这项任务。结果，２处的一个半队带部分民工，７个月就完成了１３００米的隧道施工任务，以全优工程交付使用，盈利２００多万元。
