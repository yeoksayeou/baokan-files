Three books that reenact the history of the struggle for the peaceful liberation of Beijing have recently been published and distributed by the Beijing People's Publishing House.

These three books have a total of nearly 2 million words and are very rich in content: they include telegrams, drafts, and documents from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Central Military Commission regarding the peaceful negotiations in Beijing; historical materials on the arduous process of peaceful negotiations, peaceful takeover, and the reorganization of the Nationalist Party's troops stationed in Beijing; memoirs of the early period of Beijing's peaceful liberation, including the takeover and reform, the establishment of the government, the rectification of social order, the stabilization of people's livelihoods, and the restoration of production; and the selection of nearly 70 precious historical photographs. Many historical materials are being published for the first time.
