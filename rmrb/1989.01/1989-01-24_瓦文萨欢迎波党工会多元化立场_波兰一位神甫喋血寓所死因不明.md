The session adopted the "Resolution of the 10th Plenary Session" and the "Stance of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party on Political Pluralism and Trade Union Pluralism," announcing the lifting of restrictions on the establishment of new trade unions.

　　瓦文萨欢迎波党工会多元化立场    
    波兰一位神甫喋血寓所死因不明
    新华社华沙１月２２日电  据波通社报道，波兰前团结工会全国执委会今天在格但斯克发表声明，对波兰统一工人党十中全会采取的关于政治多元化和工会多元化问题的立场“表示欢迎”，并主张“尽快同政府举行谈判”。
    波党十中全会是在１月１８日结束的。全会通过了《十中全会决议》和《波兰统一工人党中央关于政治多元化和工会多元化问题的立场》，宣布取消对建立新工会的限制。这就为团结工会的合法化提供了基础。
    团结工会全国执委会在波党十中全会结束后举行了会议。会后发表的这项声明认为，波党十中全会的决议是朝着社会对话方向迈出的重大一步。
    团结工会在声明中表示，愿意依据法律和工会章程，并遵循波兰最高利益的要求从事活动。声明表示团结工会将把国家利益置于任何本位主义利益之上。
    前团结工会主席瓦文萨同时强调，团结工会必须仍然是自由的和自治的，必须有自己的组织。
    新华社华沙１月２２日电　（记者汤德乔）据波兰天主教会人士对新华社记者说，涅齐耶瓦克神甫１月２１日在寓所躺在血泊中，被害原因不明。
    ７４岁的涅齐耶瓦克神甫任职于华沙圣·波罗梅乌斯教堂。生前经常主持弥撒并发表布道演说，支持瓦文萨和团结工会，被称为波兰教会中的“激进派”。
    波兰首席主教格雷姆普的办公室主任克鲁尔说，涅齐耶瓦克神甫是“被谋杀的”。在死者房间里“发现死者的圣衣和圣带等被盗”。
