Beijing's permanent resident population has exceeded 10 million. Despite efforts in recent years to implement family planning and control population growth, the city's population continues to increase due to a large base population and urban-rural disparities, among other factors. Population control remains a challenging task.

According to statistics from the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau, in 1949, Beijing's population was 2.031 million according to the administrative divisions of that time, and 4.14 million according to the current administrative divisions. By the end of November 1988, the permanent resident population had surpassed the 10 million mark, with a net increase of 5.86 million over 39 years.

Looking at natural population growth, over the past 39 years, Beijing has seen a cumulative birth rate of 6.49 million and a death rate of 2.10 million, resulting in a net increase of 4.39 million. There have been two peaks in natural population growth. The first peak occurred from 1950 to 1957, with an average annual increase of 144,000. The second peak was from 1958 to 1964, with an average annual increase of 174,000. After implementing family planning in 1964, the natural population growth rate declined, but the average annual increase still reached 86,000.

In terms of mechanical population growth, there has been a net increase of 1.47 million over 39 years. The growth of the floating population has been even faster, with the average monthly figure rising from 300,000 in 1982 to the current 1.31 million.

In recent years, while Beijing's urban construction has developed rapidly, the rapid population growth has led to an excessive increase in social demand. Problems such as housing, transportation, childcare, and education remain unresolved.

　　北京市常住人口逾一千万
    解放后３９年中净增５８６万人
    本报讯  北京市常住人口已经突破１０００万人。尽管这些年坚持开展计划生育工作，在控制人口方面做了不少努力，但由于人口基数过大，以及城乡差别等多方面原因，本市人口膨胀趋势尚未扭转，人口控制工作仍很艰巨。
    据市公安局户籍统计，１９４９年，北京市人口按当时区划计算为２０３．１万人，按现行区划计算为４１４万人，到１９８８年１１月底，常住人口突破１０００万大关，在３９年中净增５８６万人。
    从人口的自然增长看，３９年来，北京市累计出生人口６４９万人，死亡２１０万人，净增４３９万人。人口自然增长有过两次高峰。第一次高峰是１９５０年至１９５７年，年平均增长１４．４万。第二次高峰是１９５８年至１９６４年，年平均增长１７．４万。１９６４年实行计划生育后，人口自然增长下降，但年平均增长仍达８．６万人。
    从人口的机械增长看，３９年净增１４７万人。流动人口增长更快，月平均由１９８２年的３０万人，发展到目前已达１３１万人。
    这些年，北京市的市政建设尽管发展很快，但由于人口增长过快，社会需求超常增长，住房、交通、入托入学以及一系列生活难题仍无法从根本上得到缓解。
