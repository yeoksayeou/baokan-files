The slogan "Fight the cold, train in the third nine" is resounding again. Soldiers of the Shenyang Military Region are braving the wind and snow for cross-country training exercises.

	The People's Daily reports: New China News Agency correspondents Li Guozhong and reporter Huang Mingsong report: The various units of the Shenyang Military Region have launched a winter training campaign. Between the white mountains and black waters, the broad masses of soldiers are braving the wind and snow, handling guns and practicing artillery, and conducting cross-country training exercises, presenting a lively and vigorous scene.

	Since late October last year, more than 2,000 companies in the Shenyang Military Region have been active on the training grounds, re-issuing the slogan "Fight the cold, train in the third nine." The number of troops arranged for training, the length of time, and the richness of the content are unprecedented in recent years.

	To make the training activities more solid and effective, the Shenyang Military Region leadership requires all units to: "Have a large training lineup, not just for show; have diverse content, not just going through the motions; have a long duration, not just starting strong and ending weak." Various levels of military and political leaders have all gone deep into the training grounds. The military region headquarters sent out 37 work teams to go deep into the grassroots, coordinate various units to do a good job of implementing winter training. Various units have implemented various training subjects from a difficult and strict perspective, not only carefully following the standardized actions but also universally arranging for live-fire exercises. A certain unit stationed in the Changbai Mountains specifically chose windy and snowy areas to train in cross-country, physical fitness, and endurance. Remote guard units eat and live in dark and damp trenches, practicing command operations. All training units have universally conducted joint operations and tactical exercises for various arms and weapons under severe cold conditions. Some units that have long been engaged in camp construction tasks have increased the difficulty, combining basic training with contract tactical exercises, not only improving soldiers' military skills but also training officers' organizational and command capabilities.

　　“战严寒练三九”重新叫响
    沈阳军区官兵顶风冒雪越野拉练
    本报讯  新华社通讯员李国忠、记者黄明松报道：沈阳军区各部队掀起冬季练兵热潮。白山黑水之间，广大官兵顶风冒雪操枪习炮，越野拉练，呈现一派热气腾腾的景象。
    去年１０月下旬以来，沈阳军区有２０００多个连队活跃在练兵场上，重新叫响了“战严寒、练三九”的口号。全区安排训练兵力之多、时间之长、内容之丰富，都是近年来少有的。
    为使练兵活动更加扎实，更有成效，沈阳军区领导机关要求各部队做到：“训练阵容大，不图形式；内容多，不走过场；时间长，不虎头蛇尾”。各级军、政主官纷纷深入练兵场。军区机关派出３７个工作组，深入基层，协调各单位搞好冬训落实。各部队从难从严落实各项训练科目，不仅认真按规范动作，还普遍安排了实弹演练。驻长白山区的某部专挑风大雪深处练越野，练体能、练耐寒。边远守备部队吃住在阴暗潮湿的坑道，演练指挥作业。全训部队普遍进行了严寒条件下诸兵种诸火器协同动作战术演练。一些长年执行营建施工任务的部队，增加难度，把基础训练与合同战术演练结合起来，既提高了士兵军事素质，又锻炼了干部的组织指挥能力。
