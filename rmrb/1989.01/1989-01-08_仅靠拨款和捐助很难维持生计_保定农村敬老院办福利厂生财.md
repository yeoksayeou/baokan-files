Relying solely on grants and donations is insufficient to sustain operations. Rural nursing homes in Baoding establish welfare factories to generate income.

		According to a report from our newspaper, relying on social fundraising and individual investments to build nursing homes and operate welfare factories to support the homes is an experience gained in the development of elderly care in Baoding, Hebei Province. Currently, 260 rural nursing homes established through this method have been consolidated, providing a place for 1,561 elderly individuals to spend their later years.

		In the past, the establishment of rural nursing homes relied on national financial allocations or funds squeezed from the civil affairs department. Due to limited financial resources, it was difficult to maintain operations, and some homes collapsed after just a few years, leaving many elderly individuals in the region without a secure living situation.

		Facing the living conditions of the elderly, officials from the regional civil affairs department felt a heavy responsibility. Starting from early 1987, while promoting respect for the elderly and love for children across the region, they changed the traditional method of relying on national financial allocations to support the elderly. They issued a call to society for donations to build nursing homes, which received widespread support. By the end of 1988, officials and the public from 20 counties and cities in the region had donated over 10 million yuan, establishing 260 nursing homes.

		To ensure that the nursing homes have a stable economic foundation and are not dependent on "dead money" like in the past, civil affairs departments at all levels in the region adopted the approach of building nursing homes alongside establishing welfare factories. Currently, 227 welfare factories have been established across the region, generating a net profit of over 2.2 million yuan in 1988, making the nursing homes increasingly prosperous.

		At the same time, the region has seen the emergence of individually operated nursing homes funded by wealthy farmers.

　　仅靠拨款和捐助很难维持生计
    保定农村敬老院办福利厂生财
    本报讯  靠社会集资和个体投资建院，兴办福利厂养院，这是河北省保定地区发展敬老事业摸索的一个经验。目前，靠这种办法建立的２６０所农村敬老院得到巩固，已有１５６１名孤寡老人在这些敬老院里安度晚年。
    过去兴办农村敬老院，都是依靠国家财政拨款或民政部门挤事业费。因财力有限，难以维持，有的没几年就垮了，致使全地区大部分农村孤寡老人生活无保障。
    面对孤寡老人的生活状况，地区民政部门的同志心情十分沉重，深感责任重大。从１９８７年初开始，他们在全区广泛开展尊老爱幼教育的同时，改变传统的依靠国家拨发事业费供养老人的老办法，向社会各界发出请求捐资建院的倡议，得到社会各界的广泛支持。截至１９８８年底，全区２０个市、县的干部群众共捐资１０００多万元，已建成２６０所敬老院。
    为使敬老院有后备的经济实力，不再像过去那样坐吃“死钱”，全地区各级民政部门采取了边建院边办福利厂的做法。目前，全区已建立福利厂２２７个，１９８８年实现纯利２２０多万元，从而使敬老院越办越红火。
    与此同时，全地区还出现了一些由富裕起来的农民自己出钱兴办的个体敬老院。
