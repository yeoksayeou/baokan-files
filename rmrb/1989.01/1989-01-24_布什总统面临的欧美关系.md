On January 20, the newly inaugurated U.S. President Bush, in his inaugural address, expressed his intention to maintain "close relations" with allies. However, messages from Europe suggest that fulfilling this promise will not be easy. On January 18, Jacques Delors, President of the European Commission, delivered a speech in Strasbourg, stating that it is time for the "little brother" to stand up to the "big brother" and seek new ways to handle Euro-American relations. This indicates that Euro-American relations are in urgent need of adjustment.

Euro-American conflicts became more apparent last year, but due to the U.S. elections, both sides exercised restraint, and the differences did not surface. It seems that Bush must take action in this area soon. Otherwise, the "unity" across the Atlantic will face a serious challenge.

Firstly, there are issues in defense. Although Euro-American consensus has been reached on the formulation of a "new overall strategic concept," and the drafting of detailed rules has begun, it is still uncertain whether the new concept will be implemented this year. Local opinions suggest that Euro-American defense views are currently in sharp opposition, and Euro-American must reach a common stance on the Soviet Union before March regarding the issue of negotiating the reduction of conventional forces in Europe. At the possible NATO summit in June, the new U.S. president must present a "leader's" agenda, especially in convincing Western European allies, such as West Germany, on the modernization of short-range nuclear weapons. The issue of how to "fairly share" the responsibilities and risks of NATO defense is also a thorny problem. Western European countries are unwilling to increase defense spending and argue: first, the Atlantic Alliance was originally based on an "unfair sharing" foundation; second, Europe is already providing more manpower and equipment than the United States. The United States, on the other hand, due to fiscal deficits, insists on increasing Europe's burden, and Congress even threatens to withdraw U.S. troops stationed in Europe.

Secondly, economic friction is escalating. The European Community, which accounts for a quarter of world trade, relies heavily on the world market, including the U.S. market. It is particularly sensitive to the signs of increased U.S. export offensives. One important purpose of building a "large market" is to enhance the ability to compete with the U.S. for market share. The United States, which regards itself as the "protector" of Europe, is displeased to see the rise of the "little brother" and is even more dissatisfied with the fierce competition from the European Community. With limited markets and conflicting interests, a "trade war" is inevitable. The recent "hormone dispute" is a case in point. Agricultural trade frictions will continue to arise, the "Airbus" dispute will escalate, and new disputes will inevitably occur in the trade of high-tech products. In the financial sector, the U.S. will continue to use exchange rates and interest rates as weapons to shift difficulties, while Western European countries will strengthen monetary cooperation to resist U.S. attempts to shift blame.

Lastly, there are differences in strategies towards the Soviet Union. Generally, Western Europe evaluates Gorbachev's reforms and openness more positively than the U.S., advocating the opportunity to develop relations and influence the Soviet Union. The U.S., however, has more reservations and caution. Since the second half of last year, the rapid development of East-West economic and trade relations has caused displeasure in the U.S. At the "Bonn" meeting held at the end of October of the same year, Euro-American differences arose over the development of technology trade with the Soviet Union.

It seems that in the future, as the U.S. continues to relatively weaken, and European political and economic integration strengthens, Europe will increasingly be unwilling to accept the "little brother" status. This can be seen as the background to Delors' remarks challenging the U.S. As for the new U.S. president in the "big brother" position, how he will adapt to the changing situation and adjust Euro-American relations remains to be seen.

　　布什总统面临的欧美关系
    本报记者  魏崴
    一月二十日，美国新任总统布什在正式入主白宫的就职演说中表示，要维护与盟国间的“亲密关系”。但是，从欧洲传给他的信息看，实现这一许诺并非易事。十八日，欧共体委员会主席雅克·德洛尔，在斯特拉斯堡讲话时说，现在是小兄弟起来反抗大哥哥、争取以新的方式处理欧美关系的时候了！这表明，欧美关系亟待调整。
    欧美矛盾去年有明显发展，只是因为美国大选，双方均较克制，分歧没有表面化。看来，布什必须在这方面早点有所作为。否则，大西洋两岸的“团结一致”将面临严重挑战。
    首先是在防务问题上。欧美虽然在制定“整体战略的新构想”上已达成共识，且已着手草拟细则。但新构想今年能否出台，还是个疑问。此间舆论认为，欧美防务观点目前尖锐对立，而欧美应在三月之前就削减欧洲常规军备谈判问题达成共同的对苏立场。在六月间可能举行的北约首脑会议上，美国新总统也得拿出“盟主”的纲领，尤其是须在短程核武器现代化方面，说服西德等欧洲盟友。美欧如何“公平分担”北约防务的责任和风险也是个棘手问题。西欧诸国都不愿意增加防务开支，且振振有词：一曰大西洋联盟本来就建立在“不公平分担”的基础之上；二曰欧洲现在已经在提供兵源和装备等方面超过美国。而美国则由于财政赤字，执意要欧洲增加负担，国会甚至以撤走驻欧美军相威胁。
    其次，经济摩擦趋向升级。占世界贸易四分之一强的欧共体，依赖世界市场，包括美国市场。它对美加强出口攻势的苗头特别敏感。建立“大市场”的一个重要目的就是提高同美争夺市场的能力。而以欧洲“保护者”自居的美国，眼看着“小兄弟”的崛起，满腹不平，对欧共体的激烈竞争更为不满。市场有限，利害相反，“贸易战”不可避免。最近的“荷尔蒙之争”就是一个例子。农产品贸易摩擦仍将此起彼伏，“空中客车”争端会愈演愈烈，高技术产品贸易方面也势必发生新争执。在金融方面，美依然会以汇率、利率作武器，转嫁困难，而西欧国家将会加强货币联合，反对美国嫁祸于人。
    最后，双方在对苏策略上也意见相左。总的看，西欧对戈尔巴乔夫的改革和开放的评价较美积极，主张抓住机会，发展关系，以影响苏联。而美国则有更多的保留和戒心。去年下半年开始，东西欧经济贸易关系发展甚速已引起美国不悦。同年十月底召开的“巴统”会上，欧美在同苏发展技术贸易就发生了龃龉。
    看来，今后随着美国的实力继续相对削弱，欧洲政治、经济联合的加强，欧洲将越来越不甘心于“小兄弟”地位。这大约可以视为德洛尔讲话中向美国发难的背景。至于处在“长兄”地位的美国新总统，如何适应变化了的形势，调整欧美关系，尚不得而知。　　　　　　　　　（本报布鲁塞尔一月二十三日电）
