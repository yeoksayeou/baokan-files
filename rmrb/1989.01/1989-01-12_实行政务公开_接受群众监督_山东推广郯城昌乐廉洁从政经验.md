Implementing Administrative Transparency and Accepting Public Supervision: Shandong Promotes the Experience of Idian City and Changle County in Clean Governance

    Xinhua News Agency Changle, January 11th: Reporter Jia Jianzhou reports: Why can the "chronic diseases" of corruption such as layer-by-layer embezzlement and high-price resale of scarce resources, using public funds for banquets and gifts, excessive eating and drinking, arbitrary fundraising, arbitrary levies, and arbitrary deductions, and pulling strings and using backdoors in recruitment and job transfers be effectively addressed in Shandong Province's Idian City and Changle County?

    From January 9th to 10th, the Shandong Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government held a conference in Changle to promote the experience of clean governance in Idian City and Changle County. Provincial Party Secretary and Governor Jiang Chunyun said at the conference: "The Party and government leaders at the provincial, municipal, and county levels must set a good example for the lower levels. Whatever is required of the lower levels, the upper levels must first achieve; whatever is required of Party members, the leaders must first achieve; whatever is required of the masses, Party members must first achieve." "In the future, when evaluating the work of a level of Party committee, government, or cadre, it will not only be about how the economy has developed or what achievements have been made, but also about whether the Party and government conduct are clean. Party members and cadres who are clean and diligent should be commended and encouraged; those who are unqualified should be properly handled; and a few corrupt elements should be punished according to laws and regulations."

    When discussing how to address improper practices and corruption, Jiang Chunyun advocated for a comprehensive approach, insisting on combining administrative transparency with institutional building, leadership by example with public supervision, ideological education with serious handling, and general appeals with leading by example. This approach aims to build a strong dam against the infiltration of decadent thoughts from all angles.

　　实行政务公开　接受群众监督
    山东推广郯城昌乐廉洁从政经验
    本报昌乐１月１１日电  记者贾建舟报道：对紧缺物资层层克扣、高价倒卖；用公款请客送礼、大吃大喝；向下面乱集资、乱摊派、乱提留；在招工招干、农转非中拉关系、走后门……这些被人们视为“顽症”的腐败现象，为什么能在山东省郯城、昌乐县得到医治？
    １月９日至１０日，山东省委、省政府在昌乐召开现场会推广郯城、昌乐两县廉洁从政的经验。省委书记、省长姜春云在现场会上说：“省、地、县机关党政领导干部一定要为下级做出好样子，凡是要求下级做到的，上级首先要做到；凡是要求党员做到的，领导首先要做到；凡是要求群众做到的，党员首先要做到。”“今后考核一级党委、政府或干部的工作做得怎么样，不只是看经济发展如何或政绩如何，还要看党风、政风廉洁了没有。对廉政、勤政的党员、干部，要表扬鼓励；对不合格的党员、干部，要妥善处理；对少数腐败分子，要依法纪惩治。”
    在谈到如何医治不正之风和腐败现象时，姜春云主张采取综合治理的方针，坚持做到政务公开和建立制度相结合，领导带头和群众监督相结合，思想教育和严肃处理相结合，一般号召和典型领路相结合，从各个方面为抵御腐朽思想的侵袭筑起一道强大的堤坝。
