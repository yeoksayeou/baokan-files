The U.S. today welcomed the Soviet Union's decision to begin destroying chemical weapons this year, while urging the Soviet Union to destroy all of its stockpiled chemical weapons.

White House spokesman Fitzwater said that the plan announced by Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze at the international conference on chemical weapons in Paris on Sunday was only a "partial destruction," and might involve the destruction of only a small portion of chemical weapons. He said that the real solution is to destroy all chemical weapons.

He said that the U.S. believes that the "appropriate way" to reduce chemical weapons is to reach an agreement through the Geneva Disarmament Conference.

　　美欢迎苏销毁化学武器
    要求日内瓦裁军会议达成一项有关协议
    新华社华盛顿１月９日电  美国今天欢迎苏联从今年开始销毁化学武器的决定，同时敦促苏联销毁它库存的全部化学武器。
    白宫发言人菲茨沃特说，苏联外长谢瓦尔德纳泽星期天在巴黎举行的化学武器问题国际会议上公布的计划只是“部分销毁”，或许是只销毁少部分化学武器。他说，真正的答案是销毁所有的化学武器。
    他说，美国认为，削减化学武器的“合适途径”是通过日内瓦裁军会议达成一项协议。
