The civilian products of the aerospace industry in 1988 showed steady development, with a favorable outlook. Specifically, the aviation system saw a 91% increase in profits and a 67% increase in taxes compared to the previous year, while the aerospace system saw increases of 66% and 64%, respectively.

Last year, the aerospace industry, while diligently completing the first batch of key technological transformation projects for military-civilian integrated enterprises assigned by the state, also developed over 300 new products, including satellite ground television receiving stations, precision winding machines, extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, high-speed slubbing machines, and electric eddy current dynamometers. Currently, these products have passed departmental and provincial technical appraisals and are being produced in small batches. Additionally, 155 civilian products are included in the 1988 national-level new product trial production plan.

The export earnings of civilian products in this system have been increasing at an average annual rate of 50%, forming a series of flagship products such as motorcycles, automobiles, and televisions, with export earnings exceeding $100 million.

    航空航天部民品发展形势喜人
  　１９８８年航空航天工业部全行业民用产品稳步发展，形势喜人。其中航空系统利润、税金分别比上年增长９１％和６７％，航天系统增长幅度为６６％和６４％。
    去年航空航天部系统在认真完成国家首批军民结合型企业重点技术改造项目的基础上，还开发了卫星地面电视接收站、精密络筒机、体外震波水囊式肾结石粉碎机、高速并条机、电涡流测功机等３００余项新产品，目前，已通过部、省级技术鉴定并投入小批量生产，同时有１５５项民品列入１９８８年度国家级新产品试产计划。
    该系统民品出口创汇的增长幅度以平均每年５０％的速度递增，形成了一批以摩托车、汽车和电视机等为主的拳头产品，创汇额超过１亿美元。
