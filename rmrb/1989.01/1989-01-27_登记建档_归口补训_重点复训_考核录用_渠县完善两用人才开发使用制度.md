Qu County in Sichuan Province has continuously reformed and innovated in its practice of developing and utilizing dual-use talents, gradually establishing a system for supplementary training, retraining, assessment, and recruitment of dual-use talents. Over the past two years, 3,756 dual-use talents have undergone supplementary and retraining, with nearly 2,000 qualified talents being developed and utilized. The relevant departments of Sichuan Province have promoted their experiences and practices throughout the province.

The civil affairs and military affairs departments at various levels in Qu County have, in light of the characteristics of the county—where there are many dual-use talents returning from the military but few who are practically skilled and in demand, and where the requirements of employing units are high—adhered to the principles of producing more talents, producing talents quickly, and producing talents that are practically skilled and in demand. They have gradually established a system for developing and utilizing dual-use talents that combines supplementary training and retraining with assessment and recruitment. They first register and archive those who have obtained military dual-use talent certificates, and based on their learned specialties, propose centralized development and utilization opinions. Then, according to the opinions and requirements of the employing units, they conduct centralized supplementary training for talents whose learning and use do not match, entrusting the superior management departments of the employing units to provide supplementary courses in professional knowledge and skills. For party and government organs, administrative units, and county, district, and township enterprises that urgently need dual-use talents, they organize centralized key retraining by districts and counties. Those who are to be hired as cadres must undergo unified assessment; village and group cadres are assessed by the township, district-level cadres by the county, and enterprise technical personnel by their superior management departments.

The widely established system of supplementary and retraining and assessment and recruitment of dual-use talents in Qu County not only increases the transparency of talent utilization but also improves the quality of dual-use talents. Last year, 156 of the newly recruited district and township party and government cadres in the county were military and civilian dual-use talents. Currently, 185 dual-use talents in the county have become various professional and technical personnel in townships, and 680 have taken on roles as village and group cadres. Dual-use talents throughout the county have found their proper places and demonstrated their abilities, playing a leading role in the construction of both material and spiritual civilization. Zhang Xianming, a dual-use talent from Sanhui Town's Huidong Township, learned enterprise management in a training class in 1985 and was selected as the director of the township tea factory. Over the past three years, he has led workers to process 4,000 piculs of tea (including six types of tea that won provincial quality product awards), achieving a production value of 1.5 million yuan, paying 350,000 yuan in taxes to the state, and increasing workers' wages to 150 yuan. He has served as a provincial township enterprise evaluator for three consecutive years and has been rated as an assistant engineer.

    渠县完善两用人才开发使用制度
    本报讯  四川渠县在开发使用两用人才的工作实践中，不断改革创新，逐步建立起两用人才补复训考核录用制度。两年来，共补复训两用人才３７５６人，其中近２０００名合格人才得到开发使用。四川省有关部门在全省推广了他们的经验和做法。
    渠县各级民政和人武部门，针对本县退伍回乡的两用人才多，实用对路的合格人才少和用人单位要求高的特点，本着多出人才、快出人才、出实用对路人才的原则，逐步建立起了两用人才补训与复训、考核与录用相结合的开发使用制度。他们首先对凡获得部队两用人才证书的登记建档，根据所学专业，提出归口开发使用意见。然后按照用人单位的意见和要求，对学用不一致的人才进行归口补训，委托用人单位的上级主管部门补课，学习专业知识和技术；对党政机关、行政单位，县、区、乡企业急需的两用人才，则由区县统一组织进行重点复训；凡准备被聘为干部的，都必须经过统一考核，村、组干部由乡组织实施，区、乡级干部由县统一组织实施，企业技术人员由上级主管部门组织实施。
    渠县普遍建立的两用人才补复训和考核录用制度，不仅增加了使用人才的透明度，而且提高了两用人才的质量。去年，这个县新招聘的区、乡党政干部中，有１５６名是军地两用人才。现在，全县有１８５名两用人才成为乡镇各种专业技术人员，有６８０人担任了村、组干部。全县两用人才各得其所，各显其能，在两个文明建设中发挥了生力军的作用。三汇镇汇东乡退伍军人两用人才张先明，１９８５年在培训班学会企业管理后，被选为乡茶厂厂长。３年多来，他带领工人加工茶叶４０００担（其中有６种茶叶获省优质产品奖），实现产值１５０万元，为国家交税３５万元，工人的工资也增加到１５０元。他连续３年担任省乡镇企业评委，还被评为助理技师。　　　　　　　　　　（谢纲富　王新权）
