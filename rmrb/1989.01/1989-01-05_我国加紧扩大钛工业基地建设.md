China's sponge titanium production is expected to double this year. Officials overseeing the expansion project at the Zunyi Titanium Plant, China's largest titanium industry base, are confident about this. They predict that by the end of 1989, when the expansion project is completed, China's titanium industry production technology will also enter the ranks of the world's advanced levels.

Titanium is a new type of metal material, known as the "third metal" after steel and aluminum. It has properties such as corrosion resistance, non-magnetism, superconductivity, and light weight, and is widely used in aerospace, aviation, marine engineering, metallurgy, power, petrochemical, and medical and health industries.

China is one of only five titanium-producing countries in the world, with titanium resources accounting for a quarter of the world's total. The sponge titanium production of the Zunyi Titanium Plant accounts for 80% of the country's total production. The plant's five-ton sponge titanium reduction distillation combined method has reached the international advanced level of the 1980s, attracting the interest of many famous metallurgical experts around the world.

　　我国加紧扩大钛工业基地建设
    据新华社贵阳电  我国海棉钛产量可望在今年内翻一番。正在我国最大的钛工业基地遵义钛厂主持扩建工程的负责人对此充满信心。他预计到一九八九年底这里的扩建工程完工后，我国钛工业的生产工艺也将进入世界先进行列。
    钛是一种新兴的金属材料，被称为继钢铁和铝之后的“第三金属”，具有耐腐蚀、无磁性、超导、比重轻等特性，在航天、航空、海洋工程、冶金、电力、石油化工和医疗卫生等行业有着广泛的用途。
    我国是世界上仅有的五个钛生产国之一，钛资源蕴藏量占全世界的四分之一。遵义钛厂的海绵钛产量占全国总产量的百分之八十，这个厂的海绵钛五吨还原蒸馏联合法，已达到八十年代国际先进水平，引起了国际上许多著名冶金专家的兴趣。
