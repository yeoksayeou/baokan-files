The sound of chickens and pigs brings joy. Liu Xingmin, hailed as the "breeding champion" of the Beijing suburbs, pointed to the pigs loaded into trucks and the cages of American Avian meat chickens, happily saying, "These are for selling in the city for the New Year, all for the Beijing Spring Festival market!"

Liu Xingmin is a farmer from Xiaopu Village, Songzhuang Township, Tongxian County. In 1985, he established the first family breeding farm in the county. Over the past four years, he has sold 1,550 head of commercial pigs and 167,000 commercial chickens to the state. Among these, in 1988, he sold 320 head of pigs and 81,000 chickens.

On January 17th, the reporter visited Liu Xingmin's breeding farm amidst a light snow. He was inspecting the pig and chicken houses. He has invested the tens of millions of yuan in profits from breeding pigs and chickens over the years into developing the breeding industry. Now, he has built 49 pig houses and 81 chicken houses, all of which are red brick houses facing the sun. He also made three large-scale chick incubators and purchased a light-duty truck. Liu Xingmin told the reporter, "My wish is to achieve something, to contribute more to enriching the Beijing market."

　　农民刘兴民事业兴旺　被誉为京郊养殖状元
    ４年售猪１５５０头鸡１６．７万只
    本报讯  记者张书政报道：鸡鸣猪叫人欢笑。被誉为京郊“养殖状元”的刘兴民指着装进汽车的一头头瘦肉型猪和一笼笼美国艾维菌种肉鸡，高兴地说：“这是进城卖年货，都是提供给首都春节市场的！”
    刘兴民是京郊通县宋庄乡小堡村农民，１９８５年办起全县第一家家庭养殖场。４年来，他共向国家交售商品猪１５５０头、商品鸡１６．７万只。其中，１９８８年交售猪３２０头、鸡８．１万只。
    １月１７日，记者顶着小雪来到刘兴民的养殖场时，他正在检查猪舍、鸡舍。他把几年养猪、养鸡获得的几十万元利润用于发展养殖业。如今他盖起了４９间猪舍、８１间鸡舍，全是一色的向阳红砖房，还自制３台大型雏鸡孵化器，购买一台轻型载重汽车。刘兴民对记者说：“我的愿望就是干一番事业，为丰富首都市场多作贡献。”
