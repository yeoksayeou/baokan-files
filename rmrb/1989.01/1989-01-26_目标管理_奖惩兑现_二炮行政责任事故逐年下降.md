The Second Artillery Corps has implemented goal management for three years, resulting in a year-on-year decrease in administrative responsibility accidents. Last year, the fatality rate per 10,000 personnel in all units dropped from 4.4 in 1985 to 1.6, a 17.6% reduction compared to 1987.

The Second Artillery Corps is stationed in remote and dispersed locations with harsh living conditions. Additionally, the units have heavy tasks related to war preparedness, duty, training, and construction, which previously led to frequent accidents and affected the overall development of the units. In 1985, the Second Artillery Corps implemented goal management for safety work. Each level defined responsibilities by position, set target tasks, established evaluation criteria, and conducted periodic assessments. Rewards and punishments were implemented based on performance.

Recently, Commander Li Xuge and Political Commissar Liu Lifeng issued an order to commend 35 units above the regiment level that had no accidents and 25 leaders above the regiment level. They also awarded these individuals with bonuses.

　　目标管理　奖惩兑现
    二炮行政责任事故逐年下降
    本报讯  第二炮兵实行目标管理三年，行政责任事故逐年下降。去年全部队的亡人万分比由１９８５年的４．４下降到１．６，比１９８７年又下降１７．６％。
    二炮部队驻地偏僻、分散，生活条件艰苦，加之部队战备执勤、训练施工任务重，一度事故多发，影响了部队建设。１９８５年，二炮部队对安全工作实行目标管理，各级定岗位责任、定目标任务、定考核标准，定期进行考评。奖优罚劣，奖惩兑现。
    最近，李旭阁司令员、刘立封政委签署命令，表彰了３５个团以上安全无事故单位和２５名团以上领导干部，并给他们发了奖金。
