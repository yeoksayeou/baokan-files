The three-day-long Fourth Summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation concluded today in Islamabad. The seven participating countries' leaders unanimously adopted the "Islamabad Declaration," which stated that the current global trend is towards peace and development. South Asian countries should, under the guidance of the United Nations Charter and the principles of the Non-Aligned Movement, strengthen regional cooperation, achieve self-reliance, and jointly overcome poverty.

The closing ceremony was held at the State Bank of Pakistan. The heads of state attending the conference delivered speeches, expressing satisfaction with the results of this summit. They hoped that South Asian countries would, under the new international and regional situations, carry out cooperation in various aspects. They hoped that the "Islamabad Declaration," which was unanimously adopted, would become a new starting point for regional cooperation in South Asia.

The "Islamabad Declaration" presented the views of the leaders of the various countries on the situation in South Asia, the tasks for future cooperation, and the developments in the international situation since 1988. In the section on regional cooperation, the "Declaration" pointed out that cooperation benefits all, while conflict harms all. The common enemy of South Asian countries is poverty. In the new year, the countries will continue to deepen cooperation in 11 areas, including agriculture, science and technology, irrigation, education, health, and tourism. The newly established Agricultural Information Center will serve the research institutions of the various countries; the radio and television exchange program will continue to develop; the number of scholarships, further education opportunities, and visiting scholars sent to each other will increase; friendly exchanges between the peoples of the member countries will continue to deepen, and tourists will be exempted from visas. The countries will launch a campaign against the production and smuggling of drugs. To improve the living conditions of children, especially girls, in South Asia, 1990 will be designated as the "Year of the South Asian Girl." The countries will also take unified action against terrorism.

In the section on the international situation, the "Declaration" pointed out that since 1988, the world situation has shown a trend towards easing, with superpowers beginning dialogue in various aspects, regional conflicts gradually being politically resolved, and the United Nations playing an active role. These developments have been welcomed by the people of the world. However, the economic development gap between developed and developing countries, the increasing debt burden of developing countries, the flow of funds from developing countries to developed countries, and the increasing trade protectionism of developed countries have all made the world economic situation severe. The "Declaration" called for the promotion of South-North dialogue, strengthening cooperation between developed and developing countries, and establishing a new, fair, and just international economic environment and order.

Islamabad, December 31, 1988. Today, Pakistan and India signed three agreements: "Non-Attack on Each Other's Nuclear Facilities," "Avoiding Double Taxation on Bilateral Trade," and "Strengthening Cultural Exchanges." The two prime ministers attended the signing ceremony, and the foreign ministers of the two countries signed the agreements.

Since the beginning of this South Asian summit, the prime ministers of India and Pakistan have held bilateral talks after each day's meeting agenda. This afternoon, after seeing off the other leaders returning to their countries, Benazir Bhutto held the third round of talks with Rajiv Gandhi and decided to sign the above three agreements. After the signing ceremony, the two prime ministers held a joint press conference. These two new-generation leaders both expressed that the democratically elected governments they lead will work to improve Indo-Pakistani relations. They both invited each other to visit their respective countries in 1989, and both sides have accepted the invitations.

　　南亚区域联盟首脑会议通过《伊斯兰堡宣言》
    加强团结合作　共同战胜贫穷
    巴基斯坦和印度签订三项协议
    本报伊斯兰堡１９８８年１２月３１日电  记者任毓骏报道：为期三天的第四届南亚区域合作联盟首脑会议今天上午在伊斯兰堡降下帷幕。与会７国领导人一致通过《伊斯兰堡宣言》，指出当今世界的主调是和平与发展，南亚各国应在联合国宪章和不结盟运动原则指导下加强区域合作，实现自力更生，共同战胜贫穷。
    闭幕仪式在巴基斯坦国家银行礼堂举行，出席会议的各国首脑相继在会上发表演说。他们对这届首脑会晤的成果表示满意，希望南亚各国在新的国际局势和区域局势下，开展多方面的合作。希望一致通过的《伊斯兰堡宣言》成为南亚区域合作的新起点。
    《伊斯兰堡宣言》就南亚区域的形势、今后合作的任务以及１９８８年以来国际形势的发展发表了各国首脑的共同的看法。在区域合作部分，《宣言》指出，各国合作则互利，冲突则互损。南亚各国共同敌人是贫穷。在新的一年里，各国将继续在农业、科技、灌溉、文教、卫生和旅游等１１个方面深入开展合作。新建的农业信息中心将为各国研究机构服务；广播电视交换计划将继续发展；各国互设的奖学金、进修、互派访问学者的名额将扩大；各成员国人民之间的友好交往将继续深入，旅游者将互免签证。各国将开展反对生产和走私毒品运动。为改善南亚地区儿童特别是女童的生活状况，１９９０年将被确定为“南亚女童年”。各国在反对恐怖主义方面也将采取一致行动。
    在国际形势部分，《宣言》指出，１９８８年以来，世界形势出现了缓和的趋势，超级大国在多方面开始对话，地区冲突在逐步实现政治解决，联合国在发挥积极作用，这些都受到世界人民的欢迎。但是，发达国家和发展中国家经济发展的不平衡，发展中国家债务负担加重，发展中国家资金流向发达国家，发达国家日益加剧的贸易保护主义，这些都使世界经济形势严峻。《宣言》要求开展南北对话，加强发达国家和发展中国家的合作，建立新的、平等公正的国际经济环境和秩序。
    本报伊斯兰堡１９８８年１２月３１日电　记者任毓骏报道：今天下午，巴基斯坦和印度签定了《互不攻击对方核设施》、《避免两国贸易双倍征税》和《两国加强文化交流》等三项协议。两位总理出席了签定仪式，两国外交部长分别在协议文本上签了字。
    这次南亚首脑会议开始以来，印度和巴基斯坦两国总理在每天的会议议程结束后，都举行一次双边会谈。今天下午，贝·布托去机场送别启程回国的其他国家领导人后，同拉·甘地总理举行了第三轮会议，并决定签署上述三个协议。签字仪式结束后，两位总理联合举行了记者招待会。这两位新一代领导人都表示，他们所领导的民选政府将为改善印巴关系而努力。他们都邀请对方在１９８９年访问自己的国家，双方都已接受了对方的邀请。
