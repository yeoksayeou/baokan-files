Over 60,000 Mozambican refugees have returned home. Mozambique Refugee Resettlement Center Director Fernando Fazenda said on the 23rd at the Fifth National Emergency Meeting that Mozambique repatriated approximately 67,000 refugees who were stranded in neighboring countries in 1988, and it is expected that the number of refugees returning this year will exceed that figure.

Fazenda said that more than 50,000 refugees who have been in exile in South Africa may return to settle in provinces such as Maputo this year.
