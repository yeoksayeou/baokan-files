Today morning, in a joyful and harmonious atmosphere, the Chinese Science and Technology Lecture Team invited over 160 experts from the capital's scientific, theoretical, and business circles to gather at the Beijing Science Hall to discuss the country's affairs freely.

Vice Chairman of the Chinese Association for Science and Technology and Director of the Lecture Team Qian Sanqiang gave the opening speech. He said that in today's world, all social phenomena are closely related to management and education. The rise and fall of countries over the past century have shown that strict scientific management, rigorous scientific training, and the improvement of the population's quality are the keys to leading a country to success. The success or failure of an enterprise depends on people, and people improve their level and efficiency through management and education. The activities of our lecture team itself are a combination of management and education, with members consisting of leaders, scholars, and entrepreneurs. The purpose of the lecture team is to conduct research and propaganda in the fields of management and education. He hoped that the participants could freely express their views on the current situation.

In his speech, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee, Gong Yuzhi, proposed that while the economy needs adjustment, education, science and technology, and cultural undertakings should be developed to change the past situation where one leg is long and the other is short.

The topic then turned to education. Chen Hongsu from the Central Organization Department's Cadres Education Bureau introduced the current situation of cadres' education in our country. He said that there are approximately 30 million cadres nationwide, including about 6 million cadres in party and government organs. Over the past 10 years, their political and cultural qualities have changed greatly, with about 3/4 having a high school education or above; 80% of county-level and above leaders are excellent young and middle-aged cadres with good political qualities, high cultural levels, and professional achievements who have been selected in the past five or six years; and from 1982 to 1987, a total of 70 million cadres received education and training, achieving tremendous results.

Former Deputy Director of the Beijing Library, Hu Sha, expressed a different view on education. He said that we often avoid talking about crises, but education is indeed facing a crisis. This crisis mainly manifests in the severe damage to its sanctity, which comes from both "officials" and "business." After the founding of the country, we unknowingly introduced the bureaucratic system into schools, ranking schools by official levels. What level is the school? Its social status has plummeted. In recent years, the trend of doing business has swept through schools, with primary schools becoming hotels and professors doing business. Some educators have been forced to focus on money, so how can we talk about the sanctity of education? The crisis in education is not just about insufficient investment, so we hope that all sectors of society will come together to protect it and make it more sacred. Of course, I appreciate this saying: a crisis is both a sunset and a dawn.

Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Zhu Houze, also attended the discussion. He appealed to the participants: due to the reduction in the scale of basic construction, 8 million construction workers nationwide will be idle, half of whom will return to the countryside, while the other half of the urban workers will undergo technical training in batches to improve their ability to master advanced technologies.

Li Degeng, Wu Heng, Yang Haibo, Cheng Lianchang, Liu Guoguang, and others attended the meeting, and many comrades participated in the discussion.

　　中国科技讲学团邀集首都专家迎春畅谈    
    全社会都来维护教育神圣地位
    本报北京１月２９日讯  记者马在新报道：今天上午，在北京科学会堂欢快、和谐的气氛中，中国科学技术讲学团邀请首都科技、理论及企业界人士１６０多人聚集一堂，议论风生，畅谈国是。
    中国科协副主席、讲学团团长钱三强首先致词。他说，当今世界，一切社会现象都与管理和教育两大因素密切相关。近百年各国兴衰史表明，严密的科学管理，严格的科学训练，大力提高人口素质，才能把国家建设引向成功之路。事业的成败在人，而人是通过管理和教育不断提高水平和效能的。我们讲学团活动本身正是管理与教育的结合，其成员是领导者、学者、企业家三结合。讲学团的目的就是要在管理和教育方面进行研究和宣传。他希望与会者能就当前形势畅所欲言。
    中宣部副部长龚育之在发言中提出，经济要调整，但教育、科技、文化事业要发展，要改变过去一条腿长一条腿短的状况。
    话题转到教育，中央组织部干部教育局陈鸿苏向大家介绍了这几年我国干部教育状况。他说，全国约有干部３０００万，其中党政机关干部约６００万，１０年来，他们的政治素质和文化素质有了极大改变，高中以上文化程度的约占３／４；８０％县以上领导干部是近五六年来选拔的政治素质好、有较高文化水平和专业造诣的优秀中青年；仅１９８２年至１９８７年就有各级干部７００万人次受到教育培训，成绩是巨大的。
    原北京图书馆副馆长胡沙则对教育表示了不同观点。他说，我们常常讳言危机，其实教育就面临着危机。这一危机主要表现在其神圣性被破坏得相当严重，这种破坏一个是来自“官”，一个来自“商”。建国以后，我们在不知不觉中把官僚机制引入学校，按官级排学校，学校算哪级？其社会地位大跌。近几年经商之风席卷学校，小学当旅馆，教授跑买卖，一些教育工作者被迫钻到钱眼里去了，教育何谈神圣？教育的危机不仅仅是投资不足，因此希望社会各界都来维护它，使它圣洁一些。当然，我欣赏这样的说法，危机既是黄昏，也是黎明。
    全国总工会副主席朱厚泽也来参加畅谈，他向与会者呼吁：由于压缩基本建设规模，全国将有８００万建筑工人闲置，其中一半返回农村，另一半城市职工则要分批参加技术培训，提高掌握先进技术的能力。
    李德生、武衡、杨海波、程连昌、刘国光等与会，不少同志参加了议论。
