    International Engineering Consulting Firm Reaches New Heights
    Evaluated 179 Projects Last Year, Reduced Investment by 4.5 Billion Yuan, Regional Development Planning Consulting in High Demand

    BEIJING — Reporter Lu Mu reports: The China International Engineering Consulting Corporation, which is responsible for evaluating construction projects, optimizing engineering design schemes, and serving national key construction macro-decision-making, has reached a new level in 1988. Project evaluations have deepened and broadened, and new macro-topic research services have been added. The company completed 179 evaluation projects last year, reducing investment by 4.5 billion yuan, representing increases of 29.7% and 36.6% respectively compared to the previous year.

    The focus of last year's evaluations was primarily on energy, transportation, and raw material construction projects. For example, in the Gansu Huating Coal Development Project, the original plan did not fully consider the utilization of various supporting facilities near the mine that were awaiting relocation. After the company organized experts to review and make significant revisions to the original plan, the ground building area of the mine was reduced by over 300,000 square meters, saving 2,810 mu of arable land and 60 million yuan in investment.

    Conducting macro-topic research to provide scientific basis for adjusting investment structures and drafting national medium- and long-term plans is a new important service added by the company. Last year, in conjunction with the evaluation of projects such as color display tubes and large-scale program-controlled exchanges, the company organized experts to conduct macro-topic research. Using detailed market forecasts and objective data on existing production capacities, the company submitted "warning" research reports to national decision-making departments, proposing to limit the expansion of investment scales. This played an important role in curbing redundant construction and uncontrolled industry development, and was highly praised by relevant leaders. In the evaluation of metallurgical projects, experts discovered that many places were planning to develop furnace-rolled mills, but there were still many problems with furnace-rolled mills in terms of process, product specifications, and construction conditions. The State Planning Commission and the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry adopted the company's research report suggesting that it was not advisable to develop them on a large scale, effectively stopping the "furnace-rolled mill boom."

    Evaluation projects have begun to deepen and broaden. Last year, significant consulting services were provided for regional development plans in Jiangsu's Lianyungang, Guangxi's Nanning and Guilin, Inner Mongolia's Wuhai, and Qingdao Economic and Technological Development Zone, among others, achieving notable results and gaining approval from relevant parties.

　　国际工程咨询公司登上新台阶    
    去年评估项目一百七十九个，核减投资四十五亿元，地区发展规划咨询受欢迎
    本报讯  记者鲁牧报道：肩负建设项目评估、优化工程设计方案重任、专为国家重点建设宏观决策服务的中国国际工程咨询公司，１９８８年登上新台阶。项目评估向深度广度发展，新增宏观专题研究业务，全年完成评估项目１７９个，核减投资４５亿元，分别比上年增长２９．７％和３６．６％。
    去年的评估重点主要是能源、交通、原材料建设项目。如甘肃华亭煤炭开发项目，原方案未考虑充分利用矿区附近待搬迁的各种配套设施。经公司组织专家论证，并对原方案作了重大修改，结果矿区地面建筑面积减少３０多万平方米，少占耕地２８１０亩，节省投资６０００万元。
    开展宏观专题研究，为调整投资结构、编制国家中长期规划提供科学依据，是公司新增加的一项重要业务。去年，结合对彩色显像管、大型程控交换机等项目的评估，公司组织专家们进行宏观专题研究，以详细的市场预测、现有生产能力等客观数据，向国家决策部门提出了限制继续扩大投资规模的“报警”研究报告，对抑制重复建设、行业发展失控起了重要作用，受到有关领导的好评。在评估冶金项目中，专家们发现不少地方在规划发展炉卷轧机，而炉卷轧机从工艺、产品、规格到建设条件都还存在不少问题。国家计委和冶金工业部采纳了公司提出的不宜大量发展的专题研究报告，有效地制止了“炉卷轧机热”。
    评估项目已开始向深度和广度发展。去年，对江苏连云港、广西南宁和桂林、内蒙古乌海市以及青岛经济技术开发区等地区性发展规划，提供了成效显著的咨询，获得有关方面欢迎。
