The strike by Hong Kong drivers at the Man Kam To border crossing has been resolved, and traffic has returned to normal.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenzhen, January 30 (reporter Lin Yudong) With the cooperation of the public security, customs, and immigration authorities, as well as relevant Hong Kong authorities, the Man Kam To border crossing has recently resolved an incident where a strike by Hong Kong drivers caused the crossing to become paralyzed.

It is reported that the incident was caused by multiple factors, with the primary reason being the long-standing issue of traffic congestion at the Man Kam To border crossing, which had long been a source of frustration for Hong Kong drivers.

Starting from the evening of January 27, some Hong Kong drivers began to strike, parking over 800 outbound cargo trucks near the Man Kam To area to express their dissatisfaction. By the morning of January 28, more Hong Kong drivers joined the strike, resulting in over 4,000 vehicles blocked on the road. This not only paralyzed the Man Kam To border crossing but also caused traffic chaos in the eastern part of Shenzhen's city center.

After the incident, several leaders from the Shenzhen Municipal Party Committee and government visited the scene to handle the situation, hoping that the Hong Kong drivers would send representatives to discuss solutions, but this was rejected.

During the incident, Hong Kong drivers confronted the public security and armed police officers maintaining order. When a few public security officers attempted to record the license plate numbers of some vehicles, they were heckled and attacked by nearly a hundred Hong Kong drivers. In the chaos, a public security officer had his nose broken and sustained injuries to his chest and ribs, while a deputy director and a driver were also injured. The public security officers, in self-defense, had to fire warning shots.

To quickly resolve the incident, Shenzhen Vice Mayor Zhang Hongyi and Municipal Government Secretary Li Ding met with more than ten representatives of Hong Kong drivers in the afternoon of January 28.

After listening to the representatives' views on issues such as traffic congestion, management, and fees at the border crossing, Zhang Hongyi explained the traffic congestion problem. He said that the congestion at Man Kam To had persisted for some time due to multiple factors. Primarily, the increase in trade between the mainland and Hong Kong had led to a rapid increase in the number of vehicles crossing the border, averaging 10,000 vehicles per day, peaking at 12,000 vehicles. However, the designed capacity of the Man Kam To border crossing was only 8,000 vehicles. He stated that both sides were currently working to alleviate this tense situation. While the renovation of the Man Kam To border crossing was being accelerated, both sides were also striving to open the Huanggang border crossing as soon as possible this year to fundamentally alleviate the traffic congestion at the border. He expressed that management issues on the Shenzhen side would be resolved as soon as possible.

Zhang Hongyi thanked the Hong Kong drivers for their contributions to trade between the mainland and Hong Kong but believed that the strike was inappropriate and detrimental to both Hong Kong and Shenzhen.

After the dialogue, the Hong Kong driver representatives agreed to accept Zhang Hongyi's speech and expressed their intention to persuade the drivers to return to Hong Kong that evening. After 7:40 PM on January 28, vehicles began to leave in succession. By around 5:00 AM on January 29, all the outbound cargo trucks that had been parked on the road had returned to Hong Kong. Traffic at the Man Kam To border crossing and in Shenzhen's city center had returned to normal.

　　香港司机罢驶事件已平息  文锦渡口岸交通恢复正常
    新华社深圳１月３０日电（记者林裕栋）深圳文锦渡口岸在公安、边检、海关以及港方有关单位的配合下，近日平息了一起香港司机罢驶而造成口岸瘫痪的事件。
    据反映，发生这起事件的起因是多方面的，其中主要的原因是香港司机对文锦渡口岸长期存在的塞车现象早有积怨。
    从本月２７日晚开始，已有部分香港司机罢驶。他们把８００多辆出境货车停放在文锦渡附近的公路上，以示不满。２８日早晨，更多的香港司机参加了罢驶，以至堵塞在公路上的车辆达到了４０００多辆。不仅造成了文锦渡口岸瘫痪，还使深圳市区中心铁路以东的交通出现混乱。
    事件发生后，中共深圳市委、市政府的多位负责人，曾先后到文锦渡口岸现场处理，希望香港司机派出代表商讨解决办法，但遭到拒绝。
    在这一事件中，香港司机曾与维持秩序的武警和公安人员出现对峙局面。当几名公安人员登记一些车辆的车牌号码时，受到了近百名香港司机的起哄和围攻。混乱中，市公安局有一名干部的鼻梁骨被打断，胸部和肋部被打伤，一名副局长和司机也被打伤。公安人员为了自卫，不得不鸣枪以示警告。
    为了尽快安妥解决这起事件，深圳市副市长张鸿义、市政府秘书长李定，于２８日下午６时约见了十多名香港司机代表。
    张鸿义副市长在听取了香港司机代表对口岸塞车、管理和收费等问题的意见后，对塞车问题作了解释。他说，文锦渡塞车已持续了一段时间，原因是多方面的，首先是大陆与香港贸易增加，进出境车辆也迅猛增加，现在平均一天１万辆次，高峰时达到１．２万辆次，而文锦渡口岸的设计通过能力只有８０００辆次。他说，深港双方目前正想方设法缓和这一紧张状况，文锦渡口岸改造工程加紧进行的同时，双方还争取今年能尽早开通皇岗口岸，以从根本上缓解口岸交通紧张状况。他表示，深圳方面管理上的问题，将尽快解决。
    张鸿义副市长感谢香港司机为大陆与香港的贸易做了很多工作，但认为采取罢驶方式是不适当的，对香港和深圳都不利。
    对话后，香港司机代表表示愿意接受张鸿义副市长的讲话，并表示回去要做司机的工作，争取当晚出境返港。２８日晚７时４０分后，一辆辆汽车陆续迅速出境。到２９日晨５时左右，停留在公路上的出境货车，已全部返回香港。文锦渡口岸和深圳市区的交通已恢复正常。
