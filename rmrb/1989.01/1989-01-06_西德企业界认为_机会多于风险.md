The West German business sector believes that opportunities outweigh risks.

Our reporter Jiang Jian Guo reports from Bonn: Recently, the reporter interviewed Ms. Rogge, who works on European Community issues for the German Industrial Federation in Cologne, and Ms. Wilde, the head of the public relations department. They said: "This is a revival of the market economy in Europe. Its primary feature is not its size, but its freedom. Because the West German economy is highly developed within the European Community and has strong purchasing power, competition will be concentrated in West Germany."

They believe that, overall, whether for large enterprises or small and medium-sized enterprises, the large market brings more opportunities than risks to West Germany. For companies like Siemens, they are already global enterprises. Once the technical trade barriers that still exist are removed, they will be even more convenient. Small and medium-sized enterprises generally have limited financial resources, and the current complex border inspection procedures artificially increase production costs. The abolition of border inspections will make hidden trade protectionism completely ineffective. As the leading exporter in the European Community, West Germany will gain more favorable conditions in this regard. In addition, mutual recognition of different industrial product standards is a major measure to remove barriers.

The two ladies also believe that in the four areas of free circulation of goods, capital, services, and personnel, West Germany faces challenges in capital and services. Taking services as an example, the Netherlands has a strong transportation industry, and the UK has a long history in the insurance industry, both of which are strong competitors for West Germany. Due to high labor costs, high taxes, and high enterprise social welfare expenditures, West Germany finds it difficult to attract capital. This will force the government to take measures to create more favorable competitive conditions for West German enterprises.

They said that the large market has not caused much of a stir in West Germany because the West German economy has always been outward-looking, and the business community has long been accustomed to competing in both international and domestic markets. At the start of a new round of competition, the West German economy occupies a favorable starting point. Various industries in West Germany are hurriedly preparing, studying the impact of the large market, and some have already responded.

　　西德企业界认为
  　机会多于风险
    本报波恩电  记者江建国报道：最近，记者就大市场对西德经济的含义，专门采访了西德科隆的德国工业联合会从事欧共体问题研究的罗格女士和公共关系部负责人维尔德女士。她们说：“这是一次新的市场经济在欧洲范围内的复兴。它的首要特点不在其大，而在其自由。由于西德经济在欧共体内发达程度高，购买力强，因此竞争将会集中在西德。”
    她们认为，总的看，无论对大企业还是对中小企业，大市场给西德带来的机会多于风险。像西门子这样的大公司，早就是世界规模的企业。一旦消除了迄今尚存的技术性贸易障碍，他们就更加便利。中小企业一般财力微弱，现存的边境检查手续繁杂，人为地增加了生产成本。取消边境检查可以使隐蔽性的贸易保护主义完全失效。作为欧共体内首屈一指的出口大国，西德从这方面获得更加便利的条件。此外，相互承认不同的工业产品标准是拆除壁垒的重大措施。
    两位女士还认为，在商品、资本、劳务、人员４个自由流通领域内，西德在资本和劳务两方面面临挑战。以劳务为例，荷兰交通运输业实力雄厚，英国保险业历史悠久，都是西德的强有力竞争者。西德由于劳动力昂贵，税收太高，企业社会福利支出过高，不容易引进资本。这将迫使政府采取对策，创造更有利于西德企业的竞争条件。
    她们说，大市场在西德没有引起很大震动，因为西德经济一向是外向型的，西德经济界早就习惯于在国际和国内市场竞争。在新的一轮竞争开始时，西德经济占据着有利的起跑点。西德各行各业正在加紧准备，纷纷研究大市场的影响，有的已经作出反应。
