	Editor:

	My neighbor, Mr. Ren, keeps a donkey that has a habit of biting people. Since he did not take any protective measures, last April, my 4-year-old child was bitten by Mr. Ren's donkey, resulting in medical expenses of 1040.49 yuan. I demanded that Mr. Ren compensate for the medical expenses, but he refused, citing the animal's lack of knowledge. What should I do?

	Mr. Zhao Zhengang:

	According to Article 127 of the General Principles of Civil Law of the People's Republic of China, "If an animal kept by someone causes harm to others, the keeper or the person in charge of the animal shall bear civil liability..." Therefore, as long as the victim or a third party is not at fault, the keeper or the person in charge of the animal shall bear full compensation responsibility. If the victim or a third party is at fault, the responsibility of the keeper or the person in charge of the animal can be reduced or exempted accordingly. Mr. Ren's donkey has a habit of biting people, but he did not take necessary protective measures, resulting in the donkey biting a 4-year-old child. Mr. Ren is at fault and should bear the main civil liability. Mr. Ren's refusal to bear compensation responsibility on the grounds that the animal lacks knowledge is without legal basis.

	However, you, as the child's parents, are also at fault. According to the relevant provisions of the General Principles of Civil Law, your child is a person without civil capacity, and you are the legal guardian, with the legal obligation to protect his physical health, personal safety, and management. But you did not take good care of him, allowing the 4-year-old child to go near the donkey, resulting in him being bitten. Therefore, you should also bear some civil liability.

	You and Mr. Ren are neighbors. Since the unfortunate incident has occurred, we hope that you will first adopt a spirit of mutual understanding and compromise, conducive to unity, and solve the problem through consultation. If consultation fails, you can, as the legal representative, file a lawsuit with the local people's court and respect the court's judgment.

　　关于幼儿被家畜咬伤的民事责任
    编辑同志：
    我家邻居任某饲养的一头驴有咬人恶习，由于他未采取任何防护措施，去年４月，我的４岁孩子被任家的驴咬伤，共花医药费１０４０．４９元。我要求任某赔偿孩子的医药费。但任某却以牲畜无知为由，拒不负担医药费。这该怎么办？

    赵振刚同志：
    我国民法通则第１２７条规定：“饲养的动物造成他人损害的，动物饲养人或者管理人应当承担民事责任……”。因此，只要受害人或第三人无过错，动物饲养人或管理人就应当承担全部赔偿责任；如果受害人或第三人有过错，可视情况减轻或免除动物饲养人或管理人的责任。任某饲养的驴素有咬人的恶习，而他不采取必要的防护措施，以致驴咬伤４岁幼儿，任某是有过错的，应当承担主要的民事责任。任某以牲畜无知为由，拒不承担赔偿责任是没有法律依据的。
    但是，你们作为幼儿的家长也是有过错的。根据民法通则的有关规定，你的幼儿是无民事行为能力人，你是他的法定监护人，负有保护他的身体健康、人身安全和进行管理的法定义务，但你没有看护好他，任４岁孩子到驴跟前，致使他被驴咬伤，所以，你们也应承担一定的民事责任。
    你和任某是邻居，不幸的事既然已经发生，希望你们首先本着互谅互让、有利于团结的精神，协商解决问题。如果协商不能解决，你可以法定代理人的身份向当地人民法院提起诉讼，并尊重人民法院作出的判决。
