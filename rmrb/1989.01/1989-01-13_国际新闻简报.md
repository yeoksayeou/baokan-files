Central American Summit to be Held on February 19

Guatemala City: Guatemala's Deputy Foreign Minister Ariel Rivera announced on January 11 in the capital city of Guatemala that the leaders of four Central American countries have informed Costa Rican President Oscar Arias of their agreement to hold a summit of five Central American countries in El Salvador on February 19 to promote the peace process in the region.

Rivera noted that the foreign ministers of Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica will meet on January 16 and 17 in Nicaragua to discuss the agenda for the summit.

The original plan was to hold the Central American summit on January 15 and 16 in the capital of El Salvador, San Salvador. However, Costa Rican President Arias recently requested a postponement, citing the need to better understand the new Bush administration's policy towards Central America.

Hungary and the Soviet Union to Begin Withdrawal Negotiations

Hungary and the Soviet Union will begin negotiations in the coming weeks on the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Hungary.

This was stated by the General Secretary of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, Grosz, in an interview with the Hungarian newspaper *Nép Szabadság* on January 10. According to the January 11 report, Grosz said that the preparations for the withdrawal have already begun and now need to be concretized. The specific troops to be withdrawn and the regions from which they will be withdrawn are of different significance to Hungary. During the execution, there will be conflicts of interest between the two sides, both military and economic. He said that both Hungary and the Soviet Union have put forward their own proposals. At the negotiating table, conflicts of interest will be addressed, and then coordinated and specifically implemented.

Israeli Chief of Staff Admits Limited Suppression Capabilities

Israeli military chief of staff Dan Shomron said that the Palestinian uprising is a political struggle and therefore the Israeli military can never suppress it.

According to the *Jerusalem Post* on January 11, this official made the remarks at a secret meeting of the Israeli parliament. He admitted that the Israeli military's ability to quell the Palestinian uprising is limited.

U.S. Navy Cancels Mediterranean Missile Drills

A U.S. Department of Defense official said on January 11 that the U.S. Navy has canceled the planned missile launch exercises scheduled for next week in the central Mediterranean.

The unnamed official said that the U.S. move aims to ease the tension that arose after the U.S. shot down two Libyan MiG-23 fighter jets over the Mediterranean last week.
