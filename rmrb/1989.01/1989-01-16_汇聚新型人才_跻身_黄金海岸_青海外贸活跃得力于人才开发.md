The economic and trade front of Qinghai has absorbed over a hundred university graduates from all over the country in the past three years. The province's foreign trade earnings last year amounted to $45.58 million, more than doubling the figure from 1985. Lin Feng, Director of the Provincial Economic and Trade Bureau, said: "This is the result of our emphasis on talent."

To adapt to the trend of comprehensive self-operated exports, Qinghai Province has adopted methods of attracting talent, sending personnel abroad, and vocational training to optimize the foreign trade team. Starting in 1986, they selected talents from graduates of various universities, bringing in over 50 people each year, most of whom are proficient in foreign languages, have good information skills, and are adept at communication. The province also pays attention to the further education and training of in-service cadres, with more than 10 people having studied and returned from foreign trade institutions in Shanghai, Jiangsu, and countries like Canada and Italy. At the same time, they invested in establishing a foreign trade vocational secondary school to inject new blood into the foreign trade team.

These new talents are determined to revitalize Qinghai and participate in the competition, breaking the old notion of inaction. Last year, they ventured out of the plateau and joined the "Golden Coast" from Hainan to Tianjin, opening 8 foreign trade "windows." At the same time, they established the Hong Kong Huhu Trade Co., Ltd.

The aforementioned "windows" have brought light into the long-secluded Qinghai, broadening the channels for foreign trade. Previously, the main exports were agricultural and livestock products. Now, industrial and mining products, as well as machinery and electrical products, account for a significant proportion. Exports of textiles, light industry, non-ferrous metals, chemical industry, machinery, local products, and medical supplies have all increased.

　　汇聚新型人才　跻身“黄金海岸”
    青海外贸活跃得力于人才开发
    本报讯  记者郅振璞报道：青海经贸战线３年从全国各地吸收百余名大学毕业生。该省去年外贸创汇４５５８万美元，比１９８５年翻了一番多。省经贸厅厅长林锋说：“这是我们重视人才的结果。”
    为适应全面自营出口的大趋势，青海省采取引进来、送出去和职业培训的办法，优化外贸队伍。１９８６年开始，他们从各地大学毕业生中精选人才，每年都要引进５０余人，绝大多数懂外语、信息灵、会交际；省里还注意在职干部的进修培训，已有１０多人在上海、江苏等外贸院系以及加拿大、意大利等国学成回青；同时，投资兴办外贸职业中专，为外贸队伍增添新鲜血液。
    这些新型人才志在振兴青海，参与竞争，冲击了无所作为的旧观念。去年他们走出高原，跻身从海南到天津的“黄金海岸”，开辟了８个外贸“窗口”。同时，还派人办起香港海湖贸易有限公司。
    上述“窗口”使长期封闭的青海透进光亮，拓宽了外贸渠道。过去主要出口农畜产品，现在工矿产品和机电产品已占较大比重，纺织轻工、有色金属、盐化工、机电、土产、医保等品类出口都有增加。
