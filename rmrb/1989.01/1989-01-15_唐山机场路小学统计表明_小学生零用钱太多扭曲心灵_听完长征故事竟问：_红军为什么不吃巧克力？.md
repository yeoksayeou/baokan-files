A survey by Jichang Road Primary School in Tangshan shows that primary school students have too much pocket money, distorting their values. After hearing the story of the Long March, some students asked, "Why didn't the Red Army eat chocolate?"

New China News Agency, Shijiazhuang, January 14 - A survey by Jichang Road Primary School in Tangshan shows that each student has an average of 86 yuan in pocket money.

Recently, the school noticed that some students were spending money recklessly. To cultivate their thrifty habits, the school encouraged students to save their excess money in the bank, which would be returned to them with interest after a certain period. As a result, 50 students in Class 5 of Grade 1 saved over 4,000 yuan, and 50 students in Class 2 of Grade 6 saved over 4,600 yuan.

Most of the students' pocket money comes from New Year's gifts from parents and relatives. One student at Jichang Road Primary School received 500 yuan in New Year's gifts. Similarly, Luobei District Experimental Primary School and Wubei District Wenbei Primary School also have students who received over 100 yuan in New Year's gifts.

Some students' parents are dual-income households and leave money for their children to buy lunch every day, often exceeding actual needs, which accumulates to a significant amount over time.

Some parents also set up "scholarship funds" to motivate their children to study. For example, some parents reward 10 yuan for a score of 100, 8 yuan for 90, 5 yuan for 80, and 1 yuan for 70, while deducting 5 yuan for failing grades. Due to the low standards for awarding "scholarships," many children can receive the rewards.

With money in hand, some students spend it freely. Some eat 10 ice pops and drink 3 bottles of soda in a day. Some have even developed the habit of drinking beer. Some students also compete to show off their generosity; one student at Jichang Road Primary School spent over 40 yuan to buy three toy guns, keeping one for himself and giving two to his classmates.

Many students do not understand the meaning of hard work and thrift. A teacher at Wenbei Primary School, Mr. Pan, introduced a lesson about Deng Yingchao mending Zhou Enlai's clothes at night, but some students thought it was a "made-up story." After hearing about the Red Army eating grass roots and tree bark during the Long March, some students asked, "Why didn't the Red Army eat chocolate?"

Money has distorted the values of some students. Those with more money are often envied, while those with less money feel inferior and may resort to stealing or cheating.

The schools visited by the reporter have all conducted education on hard work and thrift, but the effects are not significant. Some educators believe that this problem needs attention from the whole society. They appeal to parents: help children develop thrifty habits. Spoiling children will only harm them.

### 唐山机场路小学统计表明  小学生零用钱太多扭曲心灵  听完长征故事竟问：“红军为什么不吃巧克力？”

　　唐山机场路小学统计表明
    小学生零用钱太多扭曲心灵
    听完长征故事竟问：“红军为什么不吃巧克力？”
    新华社石家庄１月１４日电  （记者郑战国）一个小学生手中有多少零用钱？唐山市机场路小学对两个班的统计是：每人平均８６元。
    不久前，这所学校看到有些小学生花钱大手大脚，为了培养他们的勤俭节约习惯，便鼓励学生把多余的钱集中起来存到银行，到期后再连同利息返还学生。结果，１年级５班５０名学生存款４０００多元，６年级２班５０名学生存款４６００多元。
    孩子们手中的零用钱，很多是过年时父母、亲戚给的压岁钱。机场路小学一个学生的压岁钱高达５００元。路北区实验小学、路南区文北小学，都有一些压岁钱超过百元的学生。
    有些学生的父母是双职工，每天要给孩子留下买午饭的钱，而数额大都超过实际需要，日积月累也是一笔可观的数目。
    还有一些家长为刺激孩子学习，自设“奖学金”。有的家长规定：１门功课考１００分奖１０元，９０分奖８元，８０分奖５元，７０分奖１元，不及格则罚５元。由于“奖学金”发放标准不高，很多孩子都能拿到“奖金”。
    手中有了钱，一些小学生便花钱如流水。有的１天要吃１０根冰棍，喝３瓶汽水。甚至有的养成了喝啤酒的习惯。一些学生之间还互相比“大方”，机场路小学１名学生一次花４０多元钱买了３把玩具手枪，１把给自己，两把给同学。
    很多小学生不知艰苦朴素、勤俭节约为何物。文北小学潘老师介绍，老师讲解邓颖超深夜为周总理补睡衣的课文，一些小学生以为这是“编的故事”。有的小学生听完红军长征时吃草根、树皮的课后，竟问：“红军为什么不吃巧克力？”
    金钱已扭曲了部分小学生的心灵。“财大气粗”的学生往往令人羡慕，而零用钱少的学生则表现出自卑感，有的因此竟采取了偷、骗等不正当行为。
    记者采访过的学校都在学生中进行了艰苦奋斗的教育，但效果并不明显。一些教育工作者认为，这个问题需要全社会来重视。他们向家长呼吁：要帮助孩子养成勤俭节约的好习惯，溺爱孩子只会害了他们。
