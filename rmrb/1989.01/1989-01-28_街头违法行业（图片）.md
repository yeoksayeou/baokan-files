    Illegal Street Businesses
    Recently, many outsider individual jewelry craftsmen have gathered in groups to enter our city's agricultural markets and streets to set up stalls for processing gold and silver jewelry. Business is booming. This activity is already illegal, but they also help people melt down 5-fen coins to make rings, damaging the currency.

    The state has long had clear regulations: "Counterfeiting and melting down of RMB is strictly prohibited. Violators will be dealt with according to the law." However, this illegal activity seems to have not yet attracted the attention of the relevant departments.

    街头违法行业
    近来，有很多外来的个体首饰工匠，成群结伙地进入我市农贸市场和街道设摊加工金银首饰，生意十分兴隆。这样做，本来就是违法的，可他们还帮人将面值5分的硬币打铸加工成戒指，损毁人民币。
    国家早有明文规定：“人民币严禁伪造、熔化，违者依法论处。”但是，这一违法行业的活动似乎还未引起有关部门重视。
