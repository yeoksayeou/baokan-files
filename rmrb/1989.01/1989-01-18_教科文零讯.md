Brief News on Education, Science, and Culture

    ●Gifted young artist Guo Lijian, a seven-year-old child from Nanchang City, has created hundreds of animal figurines from clay despite his illness. Recently, the Nanchang Youth Palace, Jiangxi Provincial Children's Activity Center, and the Provincial Children's Foundation jointly held an exhibition of his clay sculptures. Guo Lijian suffers from congenital megacolon, which required the removal of his large intestine and 100 centimeters of his small intestine. Later, he developed intestinal fistulas and anal fistulas, confining him to bed.

    ●The book "Path to the International Market—Knowledge and Practice of Developing an Export-Oriented Economy" will be published by the Central Party School Press and the Guizhou People's Press at the end of January. The book addresses the main issues encountered in developing an export-oriented economy and is practical and readable.
