Title: Farewell, the Actor President

On January 20, 1989, the helicopter carrying Ronald Reagan hovered over Washington, circling again and again as if drawing the final rest mark in his eight-year tenure as the U.S. President.

In American history, most presidents arrive in Washington to take office, shining like new "silver coins"; but when they leave office, they are like worn-out paper money, wrinkled and faded. Reagan is one of the few exceptions; he left office seemingly more popular than when he arrived. His successor, Bush, broke a 152-year record by becoming president after serving as vice president, which can be seen as a reflection of the majority of American voters' satisfaction with Reagan's performance.

In 1980, the United States chose Reagan for good reasons. At that time, the country's foreign policy was full of humiliations—Iranian hostages were held captive, and the Carter administration's attempt to rescue them backfired; the Soviet Union's offensive was relentless, invading Afghanistan and supporting Vietnam's repeated incursions into Cambodia. On the global stage, the United States was merely defending itself. Domestically, an 18% inflation rate was plaguing the economy, leaving Uncle Sam in a desperate situation. Where was America heading? Internal and external troubles had once dampened national morale.

Today, as he bids farewell to the White House, he leaves behind two great achievements for America.

The "economic recovery" is evident to all: the inflation rate has dropped to less than 5%, while the employment rate has risen to its highest level since the mid-1970s, creating 19 million new jobs. Economic growth has maintained a steady pace for 73 months, and the healthy development of various industries has withstood the massive shockwave of the 1987 October Wall Street "stock market spasm," avoiding a Great Depression like those of the 1920s and 1930s. The lives of the people are better than they were eight years ago.

The influence of the "restoration of national morale" extends far beyond American borders. Reagan's foreign policy of seeking peace through strength has begun to thaw the ice between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. In the eyes of Americans, this atmosphere is closely related to Reagan's unyielding and powerful diplomacy.

Reagan's ability to give Americans confidence lies in his optimistic and proactive attitude. Some mock him as the "feel-good man," but this is more of a compliment than a joke. He believes in Roosevelt's inaugural address: "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself." He firmly believes that the American people can overcome difficulties: "Don't listen to those who say America's heyday is over, that the American spirit is dead. We often see its success and victory." He saw hope for recovery in the economic recession, found a glimmer of détente in the Cold War stalemate, and weathered the greatest tragedies and crises of his presidency, such as the loss of 241 U.S. Marines in Beirut and the Iran-Contra affair. Even after being shot, he joked, "There's nothing more exciting than being shot at and having bullets fly over your head." His humor reveals his magnanimity. No wonder some say that Reagan's greatest gift to America is his high sense of opportunity and enduring optimism. When the president feels good, the country naturally won't feel bad.

If Reagan's early acting career was an unexpected "mistake," then his later foray into politics was a matter of ambition. "In the past, I never intended to get into politics. Politics was not my ambition when I was young. But as I grew older, I came to believe that one must pay the price for the happiness that God has given him." This actor "grafted" his performing arts onto the political stage, mobilizing the admiration, love, sympathy, concern, and even patriotism of the people, winning greater cohesion for his governance. He recently said that he often wonders how presidents who have never been actors can fulfill their duties.

Of course, Reagan's legacy is not without its flaws. Just as not being nominated for an "Oscar" is a major regret in his acting career, the biggest regret of his presidency is the unprecedented budget deficit he created. In the middle six years of his eight-year term, the budget deficit accumulated to $1.1 trillion! In addition, in six years, the national debt doubled, and today the government's "debt" accounts for 14% of the federal budget. The interest to be paid in the 1989 fiscal year exceeds $150 billion, more than the combined budgets of the departments of agriculture, commerce, education, energy, interior, justice, labor, transportation, and the State Department! Former House Speaker O'Neill believes that the soaring "deficit will become a disaster. Within 10 years, West Germany will be the world's richest country, and Japan will be the strongest economic power. Because of Reaganomics, we are losing our economic leadership in the 20th century."

The merits and demerits of the Reagan era are already clear to some; for others, it will take time to assess. In this sense, the new government's farewell to the old president is not a "goodbye," but rather a "see you later."

### 回头见，影星总统

　　回头见，影星总统
    陈功
    １９８９年１月２０日，罗纳德·里根乘坐的直升机依依难舍地盘旋于华盛顿上空，一圈，一圈，又一圈，仿佛在他８年美国总统经历的篇章里画上最后一个休止符。
    美国历史上，多数总统来华盛顿走马上任，宛如崭新的“银币”，光彩照人；待到卸任去职，却像用旧的纸币，皱巴巴的，黯然失色。里根却是少有的几个例外之一，他走时似乎比来时更得民心。他的副手、共和党同仁布什能破１５２年的纪录，由副总统竞选而继任总统，可以说是美国多数选民对里根政绩感到满意的结果。
    １９８０年，美国选择里根自有其缘由。当时的外交政策颇多羞辱——伊朗人质在押，卡特政府欲救，反弄巧成拙；对手苏联攻势逼人，挥师南进阿富汗，支持越南屡犯柬泰……世界舞台上，美国只有招架之功。国内经济上１８％的通货膨胀率缠得山姆大叔焦头烂额。美国向何处去？内外交困使国民士气一度低落。
    今天，他告别白宫，奉献给美利坚两大骄傲。
    “经济的恢复”有目共睹：通货膨胀率降到不及５％，就业率却上升到自７０年代中期以来的最高纪录，创造了１９００多万个新职。经济增长连续保持７３个月不停脚步，工农百业的健康发展抗住了１９８７年１０月华尔街“股市痉挛”的巨大冲击波，没有引发类似二、三十年代的大萧条。民众的日子要比８年前好过一些。
    “国民士气的恢复”之影响所及则远不止于美国本身的疆土。里根对外奉行以增强实力来求得和平的政策，他与戈尔巴乔夫５次会晤，签署了销毁中程导弹协议，美苏间的坚冰开始解冻。在美国人眼里，这种气氛与里根毫不妥协的强有力外交不无关系。
    里根能给美国人以信心，首先在于自己达观进取。有人嘲弄他是“感觉良好先生”，其实这中间是褒多于贬的幽默。他信奉罗斯福就职时的名言：“我们唯一害怕的，是害怕本身”。他坚信美国人民能克服困难：“不要听人说美国的鼎盛期已去，美国精神已死。我们经常看到它的成功和胜利。”他从经济衰退的黑隧道中看到了复苏的希望，从冷战僵局里发现缓和的曙光，他挺住了贝鲁特２４１名美军丧生、伊朗门事件等执政期的最大悲哀和危机，甚至在个人遇刺后仍妙语连珠：“再没有比遭袭击，子弹从头顶飞过更令人兴奋的事了”，幽默中更见雍容大度。难怪有人说，里根送给美国的最大礼物便是他那高昂的机会感和持久的乐观。总统“感觉良好”，国家自然不会感觉不妙。
    如果说里根早年从影是意外“误入”，那么，后来涉政则是志向使然。“过去我根本没打算搞政治。搞政治不是我年青时的意愿。但是，我长大后认为，人必须为上帝赐给他的幸福付出代价”。这位影星把表演艺术“嫁接”到政治舞台，调动起民众的钦佩、热爱、同情、担心乃至爱国主义的情绪，为自己治国赢得了更大的凝聚力。他最近还说，他时常纳闷，那些未曾当过演员的总统该怎样行使职责？
    当然，里根的句号未必画得很圆。就像未获“奥斯卡奖”提名是他演员经历的一大憾事一样，总统生涯的最大遗憾是，他的“小政府”折腾出史无前例的预算大赤字。任职８年最能说明问题的中间６年预算赤字累计达１．１万亿美元！此外，６年里，国债翻番，今天政府“背的账”竟占去联邦预算的１４％，１９８９财政年度要支付的利息超过１５００亿美元，比农业、商务、教育、能源、内政、司法、劳工、交通部以及国务院的预算总和还多！前众议院议长奥尼尔以为，扶摇直上的“赤字将成为灾难。１０年之内，西德将是世界的首富国，日本将是最强大的经济大国。而因为里根经济学，我们正丧失２０世纪的经济领导地位”。
    里根时代的功过是非，有的，已有公论；有的，论定还需时日。从这个意义上讲，新政府对老总统的挥手，不是“别了”，实在只意味着“回头见”。
