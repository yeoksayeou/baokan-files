An eight-year-old student, Zhang Ying, can mentally calculate 7866684 ÷ 3286 and write down the answer, 2394, in just a few seconds. She uses a new method of fast calculation. This method combines abacus calculation, mental arithmetic, and written arithmetic, known as the "Three Calculation Method."

The "Three Calculation Method" was invented by Chen Zijing of the Education Bureau of Pinglu County, Shanxi Province. He developed this method based on the fast calculation method by Shi Fengshou and combined it with abacus techniques. After 9 years and 57 training sessions, it has been proven that students can generally master multi-digit multiplication by single-digit numbers faster than electronic calculators after just 3 months of learning.

At today's "Three Calculation Method" promotion meeting, Chen Zijing quickly listed the prices of eight bowls of tea, one plate of bread, one bowl of soup, and two bottles of beer. Zhang Ying and two other third-grade students immediately responded with the total price of 164.41 yuan, accurate to the cent.

Chen Zijing's "Three Calculation Method" can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and root extraction—six types of operations.

　　速算有新法　乘除一笔清
    山西陈子镜发明“三算法”
    本报北京１月６日讯  记者周庆报道：８岁的小学生张颖，可以心算７８６６６８４÷３２８６一题，然后写出答案２３９４，只用几秒钟。她用的是一种新的速算法。这种速算法把珠算、口算、笔算结合在一起，简称“三算法”。
    “三算法”由山西省平陆县教育局陈子镜发明。他是在史丰收速算法的基础上，结合珠算方法总结出这一方法的。经过９年时间、５７期培训班的实践证明，一般小学生经３个月的学习，遇到多位数乘以一位数的题，计算速度都可以超过电子计算器。
    在今天举行的“三算法”推广会上，陈子镜一口气说出８盘茶、一盘馍、一个汤、两瓶啤酒的不同价钱，张颖等３名３年级小学生可以应声答出１６４．４１元的总价格，分厘不差。
    陈子镜的“三算法”可以进行加、减、乘、除、乘方、开方６则运算。
