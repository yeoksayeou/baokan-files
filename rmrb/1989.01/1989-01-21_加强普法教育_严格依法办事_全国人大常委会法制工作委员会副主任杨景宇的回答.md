Regarding the issues raised by Comrades Tao Ránrén and Lǐ Shèngfú in their letters, the reporter visited Deputy Director Yang Jǐngyǔ of the Legislative Affairs Commission of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. He said:

Once laws are enacted, they must be propagated to the masses to ensure they are understood. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, China's legislative work has achieved remarkable success. Over the past decade, in addition to the current constitution, the National People's Congress and its Standing Committee have enacted 80 laws, adopted 20 decisions to amend and supplement laws, and made 40 decisions on legal issues. During the same period, the State Council has formulated over 900 administrative regulations, and various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government have formulated over 1,000 local regulations. With laws in place, will everyone automatically comply? Not necessarily. Voluntary compliance with the law first requires learning and understanding the law. Comrades Tao Ránrén and Lǐ Shèngfú mentioned in their letters that some laws are still unclear to many people. This is indeed a problem. What should we do? Once a law is enacted, it must be widely propagated in various forms to ensure the masses understand it. Of course, it is impossible to expect everyone to master all the laws, but one should be familiar with and understand the laws relevant to oneself. For example, the people, through democratic elections, elect representatives to various levels of people's congresses to exercise state power. How can one be unfamiliar with and not understand the Election Law? In November 1985, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress made a special resolution requiring the basic popularization of legal knowledge among citizens. Over the past three years, legal education has been conducted well and has been effective. However, this is an ongoing and long-term task that must be persistently pursued.

Strict law enforcement is a crucial responsibility of relevant state organs. Comrades Tao Ránrén and Lǐ Shèngfú mentioned in their letters that some departments lack clear law enforcement agencies, and the responsibilities of law enforcement agencies and business departments are not clear, leading to mutual blame and affecting the implementation of relevant laws. Incidentally, I suggest not using the term "departmental law" because every law is a national law, not a departmental one. It is more accurate to refer to laws that apply to specific scopes and solve specific problems as "special laws." In real life, some special laws have not been universally and effectively observed and enforced. The reasons are multifaceted, but the key is whether various levels of state organs and leading cadres strictly enforce the law. The fact is that some comrades' legal awareness is still relatively weak; some do not think of the law when handling matters; some find enforcing the law too troublesome; and some are not accustomed to or familiar with enforcing the law. Is it because the laws themselves do not clearly define the responsibilities of law enforcement agencies, causing difficulties in enforcement? I think that while it cannot be said that our laws are flawless, some legal provisions are indeed not clear enough, which requires the formulation of implementing regulations and measures to make further specific provisions. But the main problem is not here. Take the Compulsory Education Law as an example. From the text, it does not clearly specify who is responsible for investigating and punishing several illegal acts, but from the nature of the illegal acts and the division of responsibilities of law enforcement agencies, it should be said that there is no problem: those who need to be given administrative sanctions are, of course, to be handled by the units where the violators are located and their superior organs; those who need administrative penalties are to be handled by the government departments according to their responsibilities. For example, the punishment for acts violating public order is the responsibility of the public security organs; if a crime is constituted, the judicial organs will pursue criminal responsibility. As for the special laws mentioned in the letters, such as the Forest Law, the Mineral Resources Law, and the Land Management Law, the supervisory and enforcement agencies of the laws are the business departments of the government, which is very clear in the laws, and each should seriously perform the responsibilities assigned by the laws.

It is necessary to strengthen the supervision of law enforcement. In recent years, there have been phenomena of having laws but not enforcing them, enforcing laws but not strictly, and violating laws but not investigating them, which have caused great dissatisfaction among the masses. In our country, different types of illegal acts are supervised and pursued by different state organs: those violating political discipline are handled by the government, and the supervisory organs are specifically responsible for this; those committing crimes are pursued for criminal responsibility by the judicial organs according to law. There is also supervision by the people's congresses, which includes supervision of the work of administrative organs, judicial organs, and procuratorial organs, and legal supervision. For example, the National People's Congress and its Standing Committee are responsible for supervising the implementation of the constitution, and the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress has the power to revoke administrative regulations, decisions, and orders made by the State Council that are in conflict with the constitution and laws, and to revoke local regulations and resolutions made by the people's congresses and their standing committees of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government that are in conflict with the constitution, laws, and administrative regulations. The Standing Committee of the people's congresses is also supervised by the people's congresses at the same level and by people's representatives; while people's representatives are supervised by the election units or voters. Therefore, as long as all levels of people's congresses, governments, courts, and procuratorates perform their duties according to the provisions of the constitution and laws, have reasonable division of labor, work closely together, and consciously accept the supervision of the masses, a relatively complete legal supervision system can be formed to ensure that our laws are universally and effectively observed and enforced.

　　加强普法教育　严格依法办事    
    ——全国人大常委会法制工作委员会副主任杨景宇的回答
    本报记者  龚金星
    就陶然仁、李盛福两同志来信提出的有关问题，记者走访了全国人大常委会法制工作委员会副主任杨景宇同志。他说：
    立了法就要向群众宣传，使群众掌握。党的十一届三中全会以来，我国的立法工作取得了显著成就。十年当中，除现行宪法外，全国人大和它的常委会共制定了８０个法律，通过了２０个修改、补充法律的决定和４０个有关法律问题的决定。同一时期，国务院制定了９００多个行政法规，各省、自治区、直辖市制定了１０００多个地方性法规。有了法，是不是人们就都会自觉地遵守？不一定。自觉守法，首先需要学法、懂法。陶然仁、李盛福在来信中反映，有些法律，很多人至今不清楚。这的确是个问题。怎么办？法律一经制定，就要采取各种形式广泛进行宣传，让群众掌握。当然，要求每一个人都掌握全部法律是不可能的，但要熟悉、掌握与自己有关的法律。比如，人民通过民主选举产生各级人大行使国家权力，不熟悉、掌握选举法怎么行？１９８５年１１月，全国人大常委会曾经专门作了一个决议，要求在公民中基本普及法律常识。三年来，普法教育搞得不错，很有成效。但这是一项经常工作、长期任务，要坚持不懈地抓下去。
    严肃执法，有关国家机关负有重要责任。陶然仁、李盛福来信提出，有些部门法的执法单位不明确，执法机关与业务部门的职责也不清，互相扯皮多，这影响有关法律的落实。这里顺带说一下，我建议不用“部门法”这个概念，因为每一个法律都是国家的，而不是部门的。把适用特定范围、解决特定问题的法律称为“专门法”更确切一些。在现实生活中，一些专门法没有得到普遍、切实地遵守、执行，原因是多方面的，关键是各级国家机关和领导干部是否严格依法办事。事实表明，我们有些同志的法制观念至今仍然比较淡薄，有的办起事来头脑里没有法；有的嫌依法办事太麻烦；有的对依法办事不习惯、不熟悉。是不是因为法律本身对执法机关的职责规定得不明确，造成了执法中的困难呢？我看，尽管不能说我们的法律都是天衣无缝的，有的法律规定确实有不够明确的地方，这需要制定实施细则、实施办法来进一步作出具体规定。但主要的问题并不在这里。拿义务教育法来说，从文字上看，对几种违法行为由谁追究查处没有明确规定，但从违法行为的性质和执法机关的职责划分看，应该说是没有问题的：需要给予行政处分的，当然是由违法者的所在单位及其上级机关负责；需要给行政处罚的，按照政府部门的职责划分，该谁负责，就由谁负责。比如，对违反治安管理的行为给予处罚，是公安机关的责任；构成犯罪的，由司法机关追究刑事责任。至于来信中所说的森林法、矿产资源法、土地管理法等专门法，法律的监督执行机关就是政府的业务主管部门，这一点在法律上是很明确的，应该各自认真地履行法律赋予的职责。
    需要加强对法律实施的监督。这些年来，有法不依，执法不严，违法不究的现象是存在的，广大群众对此很不满意。在我国，对不同性质的违法行为，是由不同的国家机关实行监督、予以追究的：违反政纪的，由政府管，监察部门就是专管这种事情的；违法犯罪的，由司法机关依法追究刑事责任。还有人大监督，一是对行政机关、审判机关、检察机关的工作监督，二是法律监督。比如，全国人大及其常委会负责监督宪法的实施，全国人大常委会有权撤销国务院制定的同宪法、法律相抵触的行政法规、决定和命令，有权撤销省、自治区、直辖市人大及其常委会制定的同宪法、法律和行政法规相抵触的地方性法规和决议。人大常委会又受同级人大监督，受人大代表监督；而人大代表又受选举单位或者选民的监督。因此，只要我们的各级人大、政府、法院、检察院都依照宪法和法律的规定尽职尽责，既有合理的分工，又能密切配合，并且自觉地接受群众的监督，就能形成一个比较完备的法律监督体系，保证我们的法律得到普遍、切实地遵守、执行。
