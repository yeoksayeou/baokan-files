Title: Relatively Stable Prices of Freshwater Fish

The Beijing fish market in January saw the price of saury, a favorite among northerners, at 12 yuan per kilogram. Yellow croaker, once scarce, is now almost impossible to find, even with money. No wonder housewives are frowning.

Unlike the past few years, the market now sees an increasing supply of freshwater fish, with stable prices. In the depths of winter, bighead carp is priced at 3.6 yuan per kilogram, and grass carp at 4 to 4.4 yuan per kilogram. Buying 1 kilogram of bell peppers costs 3 yuan, and 1 kilogram of garlic sprouts costs 4 yuan. Seeing the lively bighead and grass carp, housewives still have a smile on their faces.

More Beijing residents are now eating bighead and grass carp. People think: Our current consumption level is about at the "bighead and grass carp level."

		Reform and Price Increases

When it comes to eating fish, many people still miss the 1970s. For just 1 yuan, you could buy 1 kilogram of saury. Few people knew that to maintain this "1 kilogram for 1 yuan" price, the state spent a lot of subsidies. In Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin, the annual subsidy was over 100 million yuan, with Beijing alone spending 50 to 60 million yuan each year. The state spent a large amount of money, but residents ate less and less fish. The reason was that fishermen, following government orders, went to sea, using subsidized diesel to encourage fishing, which severely damaged marine resources. Even the offspring of fish were caught. Yellow croaker production dropped from over 300,000 tons per year to just 40,000 to 50,000 tons, and saury production fell from 500,000 to 600,000 tons per year to less than 300,000 tons. This is the consequence. For the foreseeable future, it will be impossible to eat cheap sea fish like in the past.

Before 1979, Guangzhou also issued fish tickets, but fish were still hard to find in the market. After that year, when the mandatory procurement tasks were canceled, various types of fish entered the market for trading, and fish became more abundant. "Having fish to eat" in Guangzhou became a hot topic nationwide. Thus, in 1985, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council issued a document, and fish markets across the country were opened up.

From Guangzhou to the rest of the country, it almost became a rule: once opened, prices would rise, even the least valuable bighead carp would see prices soar. People used the term "painful growth" to describe the sharp price increases. After the "pain," if there is a "healthy baby"—abundant goods and relatively stable prices—everyone can accept it. Three years have passed, the open fish market has not closed, and the price of freshwater fish has been rising, but the rate of increase has been slowing down, and people have begun to adapt.

Everyone has their own "scale" in their hearts. They compare fish prices with meat prices, with vegetable prices; they compare this year's fish prices with last year's and the year before's... After comparing, they finally find: it's still better to open up, although prices have risen a bit. Currently, in Guangzhou, the money for 1 kilogram of pork can buy 2 kilograms of fish, with per capita annual fish consumption exceeding 31 kilograms. Fish sales have surpassed meat. In the past, some places in Heilongjiang Province had residents who did not eat fish, but now, cities and towns have fish markets like those in the south, and fresh fish can be eaten almost all year round. Without price liberalization, how could this be possible!

		Abundance Leads to Stable Prices

People often say that scarcity drives up prices. This "precious" not only means "valuable" but also implies "high price"; turning scarce resources into abundance is the only way to lower prices, which is what we call "abundance leads to stable prices."

Shanghai's fish prices have been liberalized for three years, changing the old tradition of focusing on catching rather than farming. The farming area has expanded from over 10,000 mu to over 156,000 mu, with annual production increasing from 10,000 tons to 90,000 tons, and the self-sufficiency rate of aquatic products reaching 60% to 70%. Compared to the pork market, which relies on 75% external allocation, the fish market is much more flexible. In Shanghai, for 10 months of the year, the supply is sufficient, and fish can be bought from morning to evening. Fresh items are not easy to store or transport, and if there is an excess, prices must come down, otherwise, what other options are there?

It seems that to keep prices stable, production must be steady. After the liberalization of fish prices, producers have found it profitable, and farming has maintained a development momentum, which is a significant achievement of price liberalization. Farming one mu of fish in Guangzhou can yield 300 yuan, in Beijing 350 yuan, and in Wuhan even up to 400 to 500 yuan, making fish farming a path to prosperity for farmers, and the "fish farming boom" can sweep the nation.

		Profit Drives Effort

Who doesn't want to eat cheap fish? Let's all think of ways to protect the enthusiasm of fish farmers.

From the current situation, there are still many unsatisfactory aspects:

The south produces more fish than the north, and some places have already started "southern fish to the north," with insiders estimating that preservation is not a big problem, but some northern cities' gates are slow to open. Fresh fish from the suburbs of some northern cities cannot enter the city; various fees often make 10% of the sales revenue the "road money."

What worries those in the aquaculture industry the most is that we have not created many conditions for the further development of fish farming (including both marine and freshwater farming), but there are many hands reaching out for "fish" from all directions. Three years after the liberalization of fish prices, we have just created a profitable environment for the development of the aquaculture industry; maintaining this environment is the key to stabilizing fish prices and further solving the "difficulty in eating fish." We must not let fish farmers lose their profits again.

### 还算平稳的淡水鱼价

　　还算平稳的淡水鱼价
    本报记者  黄彩忠
    元月的北京鱼市，北方人喜欢吃的带鱼每公斤１２元，黄鱼从有价无市到无价无市，有钱也难买到货，难怪主妇们皱眉头了。
    跟前两三年不同，鱼市上淡水鱼日见增多，且价格平稳。隆冬，白鲢一公斤３元６角，花鲢一公斤４元至４元４角。买１公斤柿子椒还要３元，买１公斤蒜苗也得４元呢。主妇们见了活蹦乱跳的花白鲢，还是面有喜色的。
    北京吃花白鲢的人也多起来了。人们认为：我们目前的消费也就是个“花白鲢水平”。
    　　　　放开和涨价
    说到吃鱼，至今还有不少人留恋７０年代。掏１元钱就能买到１公斤带鱼。人们很少知道，为了保那“１公斤１元钱”，国家花了多少补贴。京、津、沪３个市每年就是１个多亿，仅北京每年的补贴就在五六千万元。国家花了大笔的钱，居民吃鱼却越来越少。原因是渔民奉行政命令下海，靠平价柴油刺激捕鱼，海洋渔业资源遭到严重破坏，连鱼子鱼孙也捕上来了。黄鱼产量从年产３０多万吨下降到四五万吨，带鱼年产量从五六十万吨，下降到不足３０万吨。这是报应。目前以至今后相当一段时间，再也不可能像过去那样吃便宜的海鱼了。
    １９７９年以前，广州也发鱼票，可市场上买不到鱼。这一年取消统派购任务后，各种鱼都进入市场交易，鱼多了起来。广州“食有鱼”一时成了全国议论的热点。于是，１９８５年党中央、国务院发了文件，全国各地的鱼市统统放开了。
    从广州到全国，几乎成了一条规律：一放开，就涨价，连最不值钱的白鲢鱼也翻番地涨。人们用“阵痛”来形容大幅度涨价，“阵痛”之后若能有个“胖娃娃”——商品丰富了，价格相比也不太高，大家还是能接受。３个年头过去了，开放的鱼市没有收，淡水鱼价格也一直在涨，只是涨的幅度越来越小，人们开始适应了。
    人人心中都有秆“秤”。他们拿鱼价跟肉价比，跟细菜价比；拿今年的鱼价跟去年的、前年的鱼价比……比来比去，终于发现：还是放开好，虽然价格也涨了一些。目前，在广州买１公斤猪肉的钱可以买２公斤鱼，人均年吃鱼超过了３１公斤。鱼超过肉类的销售量。黑龙江省过去有些地方的农民不吃鱼，如今，城里、乡镇都有了像南方那样的鱼市，差不多四季都可以吃到活鱼。价格不放开哪有这么好的事！
    　　　　鱼多价自稳
    人们不是常说物以稀为贵吗？这个“贵”，除“贵重”之外，还含有“价高”一层意思；变物产稀缺为丰富，高价才有降低的可能，这就叫作“鱼多价自稳”。
    上海鱼价放开３年，改了水产业重捕轻养的旧传统，养殖面积从１万多亩发展到１５．６万多亩，年产量从１万吨增加到９万吨，水产品自给率达到６０％——７０％，相比猪肉市场３／４还靠外地调拨，鱼市安排就主动多了。在上海，一年之中有１０个月供应充足，从早到晚都可以买到鱼。鲜活的东西又不易储存、调运，多了卖不完，不降价，还能有什么出路？
    看来，要想价格平稳，首先生产不能波动。鱼价放开后，生产者有利可图，养殖一直保持发展势头，这是放开鱼价一大功绩。养一亩鱼，在广州可获利３００元，在北京可获利３５０元，在武汉甚至多到四五百元，养鱼成了农民的致富之道，“养鱼热”才能风行全国。
    　　　　有利才有劲
    谁不想吃到便宜鱼呢？那就让我们都来想办法保护养鱼者的积极性吧。
    从目前的情况看，不尽人意的地方还不少：
    南方产鱼比北方多，一些地方早就开始“南鱼北调”，内行估计保鲜问题不大，可北方的一些城门迟迟打不开。北方某些城市近郊区的鲜鱼也进不了城；各种费用往往使１０％销售额成了“铺路钱”。
    最叫搞水产的同志忧虑的是，目前我们为鱼类养殖（包括海水养殖和淡水养殖）进一步发展创造的条件不多，各方向“鱼”伸手的却不少。放开鱼价３年，我们刚刚为水产业发展创造了一个有利可图的环境；保持这样一个环境，是平稳鱼价、进一步解决“吃鱼难”的关键所在。我们不可再一次弄得养鱼者无利可图了。
