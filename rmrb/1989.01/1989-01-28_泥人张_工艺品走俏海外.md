The "Niren Zhang" crafts made by the Beijing Niren Zhang Ancient Ceramics Factory using traditional techniques have become popular overseas. In 1988, they earned 700,000 foreign exchange RMB.

Zhang Tiecheng, the fourth-generation successor of "Niren Zhang," has built upon his father Zhang Guishan's clay figurine techniques. He has meticulously researched and developed six categories of antique-style crafts using clay and ceramics: imitations of bronze, ancient bronze, gilded, unearthed old glazed pottery, hardwood, unearthed clay figures, and rusted earth. The Palace Museum has acquired the "Niren Zhang" three-world Buddha statues and eighteen Luohan statues as museum treasures. Many overseas collectors, after seeing the exhibits at the Canton Fair, competed to purchase them at high prices.

　　“泥人张”工艺品走俏海外
    据新华社北京１月２７日电（记者万红强）北京泥人张博古陶艺厂，运用传统技术制成的新一代“泥人张”仿古工艺品，走俏海外，１９８８年创收７０万外汇人民币。
    “泥人张”第四代传人张铁成，在继承父亲张桂山泥人技艺的基础上，精心钻研开发，用泥陶做成了仿青铜、古铜、鎏金、出土旧彩陶、硬木、出土陶人和土锈六大类古玩工艺品。故宫博物院已将泥人张的三世佛像、十八罗汉等收购为馆藏珍品。国外不少收藏家在广交会上见了展品后，竞相出高价争购。
