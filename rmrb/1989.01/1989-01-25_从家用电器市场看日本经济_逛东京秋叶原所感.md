Experts say that to understand the development trends of Japanese home appliances, one must visit Akihabara Street in Tokyo.

Akihabara, this world-famous street of home appliance stores, pulses with the rhythm of Japan's economic development. Every day, it attracts tens of thousands of consumers. Hundreds of shops line the street, filled with a dazzling array of electrical goods. The latest products are always displayed in the most prominent positions, attracting the most attention. Technical experts and businesspeople in the field regard this place as an information base and a competitive arena. Experts often come here in the design and trial production stages to gather information. People from South Korea, the Soviet Union, and other countries frequently visit to purchase electronic components or conduct "spot observations."

It has been half a year since I last visited Akihabara. Recently, I took a quick tour and noticed that Japanese home appliances have undergone many new changes.

Televisions, washing machines, refrigerators, and other home appliances have long been commonplace in Japan and are considered "mature products." However, the new products in Akihabara are still in high demand. Compared to older models, new models have added new "life software," known as the "product revolution." Taking washing machines as an example, the noise from spinning has been a headache. At the end of last year, one company launched a new "Wife-Loving" washing machine, which, through improved shockproof measures, reduced the noise from 75 decibels, similar to the sound of a train, to 38 decibels, as quiet as a park. There is also a type of washing machine that uses warm water to better utilize the enzyme cleaning effect of detergent. As for refrigerators, considering the narrowness of Japanese homes, Akihabara offers new models that are 45 centimeters thick and have doors that can open freely to the left or right. Other new hot items include a 50-degree Celsius lice-killing vacuum cleaner, a laser disc that combines visual and auditory functions, a large-screen television over 30 inches, and a high-performance eyeglass cleaning cloth made from synthetic fibers as thin as one-fortieth of a hair. In another store, a salesperson pointed to a shaver and said, "Buy this one. It's dual-use for AC and DC, compatible with voltages from various countries, and has an electronic automatic control device that can automatically adjust to the most comfortable setting based on the thickness and length of your beard."

In a series of new products, businesspeople always strive to apply the latest technology to even the most ordinary products, without worrying about a "technological gap." On the contrary, Japan is increasingly emphasizing the combination of production and demand, fearing that it might not keep up with consumer needs. Although new products are more expensive than old ones, it is observed that Japanese consumers do not hesitate in the face of high-quality, high-performance products, and the sales volume of durable consumer goods has increased significantly compared to before.

The "life software" of home appliances on Akihabara's home appliance street reflects one aspect of Japan's adjustment of its industrial structure. The general view of Japanese economic commentators is that this is due to the "yen appreciation." The continuous and fierce appreciation of the yen that began in 1985 was initially thought to deal a fatal blow to the export-oriented manufacturing industry. However, no one expected that it was the yen appreciation that gave Japan's industry a "once-in-a-thousand-years" opportunity. After the baptism of yen appreciation, Japan's industrial capabilities (competitive and development capabilities) have increased severalfold. Professor Karatsu of Tokai University says, "The secret is actually just one: the 'yen appreciation strategy.'"

Initially, the rapid appreciation of the yen caused export-oriented enterprises to suffer from increased costs and weakened competitiveness, leading to suppressed exports. Facing this severe situation, these enterprises, while accelerating the establishment of production bases overseas, also turned their attention to the domestic market. By developing domestic demand and facing what is said to be the most demanding and quality-conscious consumers in the world, they had to arm new products with new technologies, honing their product development capabilities. The unprecedented yen appreciation increased the crisis awareness of Japanese enterprises. Under the pressure of being blocked in front (by the United States) and pursued from behind (by the four Asian tigers), enterprises boldly implemented thorough reforms such as reducing personnel, closing and merging, and lowering costs, as well as rationalization measures. They transferred industries that had lost competitiveness overseas, focusing domestically on high-tech, high-value-added products. Some long-standing difficulties were also smoothly resolved under the "appreciation strategy."

"Losing a horse may bring good fortune." Yen appreciation brought obstacles to Japan's exports, but Japanese enterprises, through a series of countermeasures, turned adversity into advantage, turning pressure into motivation, and enhancing their strength and competitiveness. Statistics show that currently, the investment ratio of Japan's manufacturing industry exceeds the highest level during the high-speed growth period. Even industries that were once considered "structural recession" such as steel, chemicals, and pulp, "all have the highest production and profits in history." Industries such as televisions, electronic semiconductors, and home appliances, which were hit by yen appreciation, are all "prosperous."

What I saw on Akihabara's home appliance street in Tokyo reminded me of the words of a certain economic figure: In the changing tide, timely self-reform and adaptation to new environments are the key to enterprise development. In fierce competition, always directing the information antenna towards consumers, such products developed in this way, "will not worry about not having a place in the world market."

### 从家用电器市场看日本经济——逛东京秋叶原所感

　　从家用电器市场看日本经济
    ——逛东京秋叶原所感
    本报记者  孙东民
    行家们说，要知道日本家电产品的发展动向，不可不去看看东京秋叶原一条街。
    秋叶原，这条名闻世界的家用电器商店街，跳动着日本经济发展的脉搏。每天，它吸引着数以万计的消费者。这里数百家商店鳞次栉比，各种五光十色的电器商品塞满店铺入口，最新推出的产品总是陈放在最显眼的位置，倍受青睐。精于此道的技术专家和企业家们把这里看作是信息基地和竞争场所，专家们往往在产品的设计、试制阶段来这里捕捉信息。南朝鲜、苏联等世界各地的有关人士不时光顾，采购电子部件或作“定点观察”。
    有半年没逛秋叶原了。最近走马观花地结伴一游，感到日本的家电产品又有不少新变化。
    电视机、洗衣机、冰箱等家用电器消费品在日本早已普及，被看作是“成熟商品”，但秋叶原的新产品却仍属抢手货之列。与旧型号相比，新型号增加了新的“生活软件”，人称“商品革命”。以洗衣机为例，脱水噪音问题令人头疼。去年年底，一家企业推出新型“爱妻号”洗衣机，通过改善防震措施，把噪音由列车轰鸣般的７５分贝降到如公园般安静的３８分贝，还有一种便于发挥洗衣粉中酶去污效力的温水型洗衣机。再如冰箱，针对日本住宅窄小的特点，秋叶原摆出了４５厘米厚、箱门可左右自由开启的新型号。诸如温度在５０摄氏度的灭虱型吸尘器、视与听结合的激光唱盘、３０英寸以上的大屏幕电视和用粗细相当于４０分之一头发丝的合成纤维制成的高性能擦眼镜布，都是新的热门商品。另一家商店里，一位店员指着一种刮胡刀介绍：“买这个吧，直流交流两用，各国电压都可以，电子自动控制装置，能根据您的胡须粗细长短，自动作出使您感到最舒适的选择。”
    在一系列的新商品中，企业家们总是极力想把最新的技术应用到哪怕是最不起眼的产品上，用不着担心有“技术温差”，相反，日本越来越重视生产厂家与需求结合，唯恐赶不上消费者的需要。尽管新产品价格高于旧产品，但据观察，在高质量、高性能的商品面前，日本的消费者似乎并不因此而却步，家用耐用消费品销售量比以往有明显增加。
    秋叶原家用电器商店街家电产品的“生活软件化”，反映了日本调整产业结构的一个侧面。日本经济评论家的普遍看法是，它得益“日元升值”。发端于１９８５年的持续猛烈的日元升值，开始时人们估计将会给出口型的制造业以致命的一击。但谁也没有意料到，正是日元升值给日本的产业以“千载难逢”的良机，经过日元升值的洗礼，日本的工业能力（竞争及开发能力）成倍增强。东海大学唐津教授说，其中秘密其实只有一条：“日元升值对策”。
    初期，过猛的日元升值，使得出口型企业因成本提高，竞争力减弱，出口受到抑制。面对这种严峻的情势，这些企业在加快去海外建立生产据点的同时，又把眼光投向国内市场，通过开拓内需，面对据说是世界上最挑剔、对产品质量要求最苛刻的日本消费者，必须用新技术武装新产品，磨练了商品的开发能力。前所未有的日元升值，使日本企业增加了危机意识，在前有拦截（美国），后有追兵（亚洲四小）的夹击中，企业大胆进行了削减人员、关停并转、降低成本等彻底的整顿以及合理化的措施，把失去竞争力的产业向国外转移，国内集中搞高技术、高附加价值的产品。一些通常不好解决的老大难，也在“升值对策”的号令下顺利得到解决。
    “塞翁失马，安知非福。”日元升值给日本出口带来障碍，但日本企业却通过一系列应变措施，变不利为有利，变压力为动力，增强了体质和竞争能力。据统计，目前日本制造业设备投资的比率超过高速增长时期的最高水平，甚至过去被看成“结构性萧条”的钢铁、化学、纸浆等材料产业“均具有过去最高水平的产量和收益”，曾受日元升值打击的电视、电子半导体、家用电器产业都是“一片景气”。
    东京秋叶原家用电器商店街所见，使我想起某经济界人士的话：在变化的潮流中，不失时机的自我变革，适应新环境，是企业发展的关键。在激烈竞争中，总是把信息天线指向消费者，这样开发出的产品，“不愁在世界市场上没有它的地位”。
