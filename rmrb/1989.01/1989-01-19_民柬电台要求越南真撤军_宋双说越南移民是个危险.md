Democratic Kampuchea Radio today broadcasted an article stating that if Vietnam genuinely withdraws its troops from Cambodia, the Cambodian people will be pleased.

The article said that recently, Vietnamese leaders have repeatedly stated that they will withdraw from Cambodia as soon as possible to solve the Cambodian issue, so as to free up time for economic construction. The article pointed out that to show the sincerity of the Vietnamese leaders, Vietnam should immediately stop sending more troops to Cambodia, stop disguising invading Vietnamese troops as Khmer soldiers, and not hide the invading Vietnamese troops in the jungle. Instead, all military and non-military personnel, as well as the Vietnamese troops already disguised as Khmer soldiers, should be withdrawn without exception.

The article said that Vietnamese leaders should actively respond to Prince Norodom Sihanouk's five-point peace plan, send representatives to negotiate with the Democratic Kampuchea United Government, and discuss the paths and timetables for the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops. Only by doing so can the Cambodian issue be resolved as soon as possible. Otherwise, the statements of Vietnamese leaders are lies. Lies are not believed by anyone.

Democratic Kampuchea Radio today broadcasted that the Prime Minister of the Democratic Kampuchea United Government, Son Sann, said in a speech on the Voice of Khmer that Vietnam has moved tens of thousands of people into Cambodia, which is a danger to Cambodia.

Son Sann said that the cessation of aid to the resistance forces must be after all Vietnamese troops withdraw from Cambodia. As long as there is one Vietnamese soldier left in Cambodia, such external aid should not be stopped. He pointed out that after the Vietnamese withdrawal, there should be international supervision in Cambodia.

　　民柬电台要求越南真撤军
    宋双说越南移民是个危险
    新华社北京１月１８日电  民主柬埔寨电台今天广播的一篇文章说，如果越南真正从柬埔寨撤军，柬埔寨人民将为此感到高兴。
    文章说，最近越南领导人多次表示，要尽快从柬埔寨撤军，解决柬埔寨问题，以便腾出时间进行经济建设。文章指出，为了显示越南领导人的诚意，越南从现在起就应该停止向柬埔寨增兵，停止把侵柬越军伪装成高棉士兵，不要把侵柬越军撤进丛林隐蔽起来，而应该把所有军事、非军事人员以及已经伪装成高棉士兵的越军一个不留地撤回国内。
    文章说，越南领导人应该积极响应诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王提出的５点和平计划，派出代表来与民主柬埔寨联合政府谈判，讨论关于越军撤出的途径和时间表。只有这样做，柬埔寨问题才能尽快解决。否则，越南领导人的讲话只是谎言。谎言是没有人相信的。
    新华社北京１月１８日电　据民柬电台今天广播，民柬联合政府总理宋双在高棉之声电台发表讲话时指出，越南已向柬埔寨移民几十万人，这对柬埔寨是个危险。
    宋双说，停止对抵抗力量的援助必须在全部越军撤出柬埔寨之后，只要在柬埔寨留有一个越军，这种外部援助就不应该停止。他指出，越南撤军后，柬埔寨国内应该有国际监督。
