The "Chinese Women's Patriotic Savings" campaign will be launched across the country. This campaign is jointly initiated by the All-China Women's Federation, the People's Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, and the Agricultural Bank of China.

The second session of the Sixth National Committee of the All-China Women's Federation, which concluded today, called on women to uphold the virtues of thrift, practice moderate consumption, save every penny, kilowatt-hour, drop of water, grain, and piece of coal, and deposit the savings in banks to support national construction. The patriotic savings of millions of women will undoubtedly have a positive impact on stabilizing the national finances and alleviating the difficulties caused by a shortage of funds.

It is reported that some regions have already organized women to save money, accumulating tens of millions of yuan in a short period of time, which has solved the financial difficulties in purchasing agricultural and sideline products in the local area.

The All-China Women's Federation also adopted the "Decision on Fully Playing the Supervisory Role of Women's Federations in Anti-Corruption Campaigns." The decision requires all levels of women's federations to place anti-corruption work on the important agenda, represent women in resisting and fighting against various forms of corruption; utilize the advantages of mass organizations to play a role in democratic supervision in national political life; use the newspapers and other effective means of the women's federation system to promote social justice and carry out public opinion supervision; use the channels of the women's federation to timely reflect the situation to various levels of party committees, governments, and relevant departments, and mobilize women to report on corrupt practices.

There are already more than 8 million female cadres in China, accounting for 28.8% of the total number of cadres. The All-China Women's Federation calls on female cadres to start with themselves and maintain a clean style of work; calls on cadres at all levels to promote their families to maintain a clean style of work.
