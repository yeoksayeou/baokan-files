The Heart of a Communist Party Member
– A Record of the Manager of Shandong Zibo Xinglong Enterprise Company, Cheng Yuanpei

In 1972, at the age of 30, Cheng Yuanpei became the Party Branch Secretary of a brigade. On the first night of his tenure, he wrote the following words of self-admonition on the cover of his diary: "I am a piece of coal, and I will dedicate all my energy to Longyi."

Longyi Village is a village in Longquan Town, Zichuan District, Zibo City, Shandong Province. In 1972, Longyi Village's economy ranked 13th in the town, with an annual per capita income of only 98 yuan. By 1988, the village's total income had reached 20 million yuan, with a per capita income of 1,300 yuan. The annual per capita value of production in the town, district, and city all ranked at the forefront.

"To seek development in one's career, one must have a competitive spirit. And the competition for talent is the most important of all competitions." This is another passage from Cheng Yuanpei's diary.

So, how did Cheng Yuanpei identify and utilize talent?

There is a story of "three visits to the thatched cottage": A neighboring village had a construction team technician named Zhang Jia Shuang. By chance, Old Cheng met him and saw that he was a capable person. When the construction team fell into difficulties, Old Cheng invited him to Longyi to do something. He visited him seven or eight times. Little Zhang knew that Old Cheng was a capable leader who knew how to use people, but he had various concerns and did not agree. On a cold afternoon in early spring, Old Cheng led the entire village cadre team to seek talent. Zhang Jia Shuang was moved and finally agreed. Zhang Jia Shuang brought seven households to Longyi. Seeing that Old Cheng treated him sincerely, he immediately started a construction and installation company, earning 14.2 million yuan in income and 3.3 million yuan in profits in the first year.

Longyi also collaborated with Shanghai Yangzi River Electronic Instrument Development Company for horizontal integration. The couple, Lü Zengmin and Liu Yuejuan, traveled thousands of miles to Longyi to establish the Huiguang Electronic Appliance Factory and Electronic Component Factory. Longyi provided funding, factory buildings, and 50 workers. The electronic appliances produced by the Electronic Appliance Factory, the Qiyan brand current limiter, are popular in Singapore and Pakistan. The "multi-functional combustible gas control alarm" and "VPS uninterruptible voltage stabilizer" filled a gap in the domestic market.

Experts and skilled workers made Longyi Village's economy develop rapidly, and villagers' incomes increased several times. In the past, some people complained that Old Cheng "prefers in-laws over sons," favoring outsiders. Now they all praise Old Cheng for having foresight.

Currently, Xinglong Enterprise Company has recruited 17 engineers, forming an economic and technological think tank.

On a late autumn night in 1988, Cheng Yuanpei wrote the following words in his diary: "Risk tests the pursuit, courage, and determination of every enterprise leader; it mobilizes the wisdom, ability, and potential of every enterprise leader; risk tempers the will, perseverance, and even psychological quality of every enterprise leader. Only in risk can an enterprise leader grow and mature. A Communist Party member must always remember the mission of the Party in the new era to dare to take this risk."

To adapt to the new situation of deepening reforms, he took the lead in implementing the cadre retirement system, paving the way for the subsequent implementation of competitive bidding. For a long time, the village had formed a cadre group. In recent years, some comrades, due to age, health, ability, and ideological level, were not suitable for the rapidly changing new situation. What to do? Maintaining the status quo is not conducive to the development of the rural economy, and simply using administrative methods to let a part of the comrades retire is not conducive to unity. Old Cheng, after deep consideration, submitted the proposal to the Party Branch and Village Committee for discussion, deciding to handle the retirement procedures for all current cadres in the village. Retirement pay is issued according to the length of service, and those who are old, weak, and have served for a long time are treated favorably.

Next, from Xinglong Enterprise Company to its affiliated enterprises, competitive bidding began. There was no distinction between cadres and the masses, between inside and outside the village, between those who had previously held positions and those who had not. No predetermined candidates were selected, and no seniority was considered. All participants started on the same line, competing equally based on their true abilities and learning.

The competition started with the position of general manager of Longquan Theater. Cheng Yuanpei participated as an ordinary member. He thought that if there was a stronger candidate who could make the village run faster on the road to prosperity, he would actively support the winner's work. After nearly 2,000 villagers chose, he continued to serve as the company's general manager. Subsequently, various enterprises competed for the bid. Old Cheng signed the contract with the winner on the spot and invited the legal advisor to certify it according to the law. All winners had to pay a risk deposit or mortgage their personal property. The general manager paid 20,000 yuan as required, and all the winners of the subordinate enterprises paid in full.

In this way, each winner took on the risk and pressure and took office.

　　共产党员的胸怀    
    ——记山东淄博兴龙企业公司经理程元佩
    孙丰深　张信辉
    １９７２年，程元佩３０岁时当上了大队党支部书记。上任的第一天晚上，他在日记扉页上写下了这样一段自勉的话：“我是一块煤炭，要把全部的热能献给龙一。”
    龙一村是山东淄博市淄川区龙泉镇的一个村。１９７２年龙一村经济居全镇第１３位，人均年收入仅９８元；１９８８年全村总收入已达２０００万元，人均收入１３００元。年人均创产值在全镇、全区、全市均已名列前茅。
    　　　　（一）
    “要想求得事业上的发展，就要有竞争意识。而人才的竞争是诸竞争之首。”这是程元佩日记本上的另一段话。
    那么，程元佩是怎么识才、用才的呢？
    有个三顾“茅庐”的故事：临村有一个建筑队技术员，名叫张家双。一个偶然机会老程认识了他，并看出他是个将才。当那个建筑队陷入困境时，老程请他到龙一去干一番事业。先后找过他七八次。小张早知老程是个善用人的干部，但有种种顾虑，没有松口。在初春的一个阴冷的下午，老程率领全体村干部登门求贤。张家双感动了，终于点了头。张家双带领７户人家迁到龙一村。他看到老程以诚相待，马上办起了建筑安装公司，当年就收入１４２万元，盈利３３万元。
    龙一还同上海扬子江电子仪器开发公司搞横向联合。该公司的吕增民、刘月娟夫妇俩，不远千里来龙一办起了沪光电子电器厂和电子配件厂。龙一提供了资金、厂房和５０名工人。电子电器厂生产的齐艳牌镇流器，在新加坡和巴基斯坦备受欢迎。“多功能可燃气体控制报警器”和“ＶＰＳ不间断稳压电源”填补了国内空白。
    行家里手使龙一村的经济大发展，村民的收入成倍增加。过去有的人埋怨老程“女婿香，儿子臭”，重用外乡人。现在都夸老程有眼光。
    目前，兴龙企业公司已招聘了１７名工程师，形成了一支经济、科技智囊团。
    　　　　（二）
    １９８８年晚秋的一天深夜，程元佩在日记本写上了下面这段话：“风险，考验着每一个企业领导者的追求、胆识和魄力；调动着每一个企业领导者的智慧、才干和潜能；风险，磨练着每一个企业领导者的意志、毅力乃至心理素质。一个企业领导者只有在风险中才能成长起来、成熟起来，一个共产党员，只有时刻牢记党在新时期的使命，才敢冒这个风险。”
    为了适应深化改革的新形势，他率先推行干部退职制度，给下一步实行的夺标竞选铺平道路。长期以来，村里形成了一个干部群。近年来，有些同志因年纪、身体、能力、思想水平等所限，不适应迅猛变化的新形势。怎么办？维持现状，不利于农村经济的发展，简单地用行政方法让一部分同志退下来不利于团结。老程经过深思熟虑，提交党支部和村委会讨论，决定对本村现职干部一律办理退职手续。按任职时间发放退职金，对年老体弱任职时间长的照顾从优。
    接着，从兴龙企业公司到所属各企业开始实行招标，不分干部群众，不分村内村外，不分原来任职不任职，不搞内定人选，搞论资排辈，各参加竞争者一律在同一条起跑线上凭真才实学平等竞争。
    竞争先从龙泉影剧院总经理这一职务开始。程元佩作为普通一员参加竞争。他想，如有强手胜他一筹，能使全村在富路上迅跑，他将积极支持中标者的工作。经过全村近２０００口人的挑选，他继续连任公司总经理。随后，各企业竞争者夺标。老程当场同中标者签定承包合同，并请法律顾问处依法公证。凡中标者，都须交风险金，或以个人的财产抵押。总经理按规定交了两万元，下属各企业中标者均如数交齐。
    这样，每一个中标者都带着风险，带着压力走马上任。
