Puyang Addresses Compensation for Agricultural Technicians to Accelerate the Promotion of New Technologies

According to Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, January 11th — Puyang City in Henan Province has addressed the compensation issue for agricultural technicians, thereby boosting their enthusiasm and accelerating the promotion of various new technologies, which in turn has promoted the development of agricultural production.

Puyang City has over 1,600 agricultural technicians. After the implementation of the responsibility system in various rural areas, the issue of compensation for agricultural technicians was not properly resolved, which dampened their enthusiasm and affected the promotion of various new agricultural technologies. The leaders of the Puyang Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government believe that whether the enthusiasm of agricultural technicians can be mobilized and whether a market-oriented agricultural science network at the city, county, township, and village levels can be established and improved directly relates to the development of Puyang's agricultural economy.

The city allocated 360,000 yuan from the local budget last year for the training expenses of agricultural technicians and subsidies for their compensation. In addition to an annual fixed subsidy of 100 yuan, agricultural technicians receive additional compensation for missed work and reimbursement for travel expenses when attending meetings or other activities. For those involved in seed breeding, the agricultural department provides subsidies based on the breeding area and seed yield. In Nanle, Qingfeng, and Puyang counties, additional subsidies are provided from the county's agricultural block funds for agricultural technicians who promote high-yield seeds and other agricultural technologies.

The aforementioned measures have effectively boosted the enthusiasm of agricultural technicians in promoting agricultural science and technology.

　　濮阳解决农技员报酬问题
    加快各项新技术推广进度
    据新华社郑州１月１１日电  （通讯员刘殿文）河南省濮阳市通过解决农民技术员的报酬问题，调动起农民技术员的积极性，加快了各项新技术的推广进度，促进了农业生产的发展。
    濮阳市有农民技术员１６００多人。在各地农村实行责任制后，由于没有解决好农民技术员的待遇问题，挫伤了这些人的积极性，影响了各项农业新技术的推广工作。濮阳市委、市政府领导人认为，能否把农民技术员的积极性调动起来，建立和完善市、县、乡、村４级农科网，直接关系着濮阳农业经济的发展。
    这个市于去年初从地方财政中筹集３６万元资金，用于农民技术员的培训经费和农民技术员的报酬补贴。每个农民技术员除全年定额补贴１００元外，外出开会或参加其它活动增发误工补贴和报销路费。对搞良种繁育的农民技术员，农业部门根据育种面积和种子产量补助经费。南乐、清丰、濮阳３县，对推广良种和其它农业技术的农民技术员，还用县里的农业切块资金再予补贴。
    上述办法有力地调动了农民技术员推广农业科学技术的积极性。
