Title: Stories and What Lies Beyond: A Review of Li Xiufeng's "Village Tales"
Author: Su Hua
Date: 1989-01-03
Edition: 5

The Shanxi writer Li Xiufeng published six short stories titled "Village Remnants" in the September to November 1988 issues of *Spark*. These stories have garnered some attention from readers and critics. Li Xiufeng has long lived in the loess plateau of northwestern Shanxi, cherishing the farmers of this land, pitying the village women, and respecting the simple lifestyle and tenacious spirit of survival, as well as the vibrant and joyful vitality of life. These elements constitute the rich aesthetic content of his novels, making him, after Li Rui, another writer who explores and reflects on the national psychology and character, and the consciousness of human existence in this land full of original vitality. He observes life at the intersection of history and reality.

Li Xiufeng's six short stories weave together the new tide of modern civilization and the traditional culture of the nation, the old ways of survival and the yearning for a better life. They narrate simple, solid, yet fluid stories of characters, while reflecting on the fate of ordinary farmers. The nostalgia and pity for the old way of life of farmers, combined with the modern consciousness of life, form the heavy tragic implications of these stories.

Li Xiufeng's handling of themes and narrative techniques in this set of stories may not be as skillful as Li Hangyu's "The Last Fisherman," Li Rui's "Thick Soil," Zheng Yi's "Distant Village," or Zaxi Dawa's "Soul Tied to a Leather Knot," but he is a master of storytelling. Through the narration of intriguing and captivating stories like those of Ding Guoliang ("Heart's Joy"), "Cat Granny" ("Cat Granny"), and Jie Wu ("Kiln God"), he balances recognition, entertainment, education, and literary functions, naturally guiding readers to explore and think about the thematic content of the stories through these characters. In "Heart's Joy," "Cat Granny," and "Kiln God," the author distills the character stories into vivid and profound narratives. Each plot point is aligned with the character's fate, and every detail serves to reveal the theme of the character's fate and the necessary links in the chain of cause and effect. The author's goal is not only to show the natural actions of the characters but also to use these engaging stories to prompt readers to delve deeper, understand the characters' qualities and fates, and involuntarily immerse themselves in the author's narrative. This way, readers move from liking to caring, from curiosity to concern, and after finishing the stories, they reflect and gain insights about the people and events they have experienced. Of course, crafting a good story that captures the reader's interest is not difficult, but what is challenging is creating a high-quality story with profound implications. Such stories with deep implications are not immediately clear to readers, but after finishing the entire work, readers can distinctly feel their rich intellectual content. Li Xiufeng's ingenuity lies here. In his stories, he infuses philosophical questions into the simple and understandable narratives, supporting the quality of these stories. In "Heart's Joy," Ding Guoliang provides readers with a vast space to ponder the philosophy of existence. This character, with his Ah Q consciousness, combines the cyclical human experience of hope and disappointment, joy and pain, and existential emptiness, with the idea that everyone has their own way of living. This gives the work tremendous tension and the allure of contemplation, making the story and characters appear weighty. For example, in "Cow Transformation," the author merely creates a fantastical, allegorical story of slaughtering a cow to feed the villagers, but the story's conclusion, "Thirteen years have passed since then, and no cows have been slaughtered in Qilihe, nor have there been any fights...," imbues the story with a quest for goodness, filling the simple life with the surging forces of life, goodness, and beauty.

Li Xiufeng's set of village tales are about ordinary, lower-class characters, but each character is distinct. His characters are not mere composites of temperament and personality but are rounded and three-dimensional, even the background characters are not simple flat figures. Jie Wu in "Kiln God" is a tough and resilient man who, though passive, does not retreat in the face of hardship and stands firmly against corruption. He completes his final, bold stroke with his personality and life. Although his life ends, his lazy yet steadfast character stands out in motion.

"Fight" and "Old Marriage" in this set of stories appear somewhat thin. Although the author attempts to portray a well-known national flaw in "Fight" and "Old Marriage," the ideas overshadow the imagery, and the themes are too explicit and shallow, weakening the impact of the stories. However, the dialogues in these two stories are quite excellent. The dialogue between the two brothers in "Fight" is vivid and lively; the dialogue between Ershendan and Chanchan in "Old Marriage" is fitting and natural. From these dialogues, one can not only hear the characters' identities but also infer their personalities, behaviors, and thoughts and feelings. In some current novels that use dialogue to drive the plot, Li Xiufeng's dialogues in these two stories are among the most dynamic and emotionally rich, with distinct personalities.

　　故事和故事的后面
    ——评李秀峰的“村闾小说”
    苏华
    山西作家李秀峰在《火花》１９８８年９—１１期上连续发表的六篇题为《村闾拾遗》的小说，在读者和评论界引起了一些的反响。他长期生活在晋西北黄土高原，热爱这块土地上的庄稼汉，怜悯这里的村妇，崇敬这里淳朴的生活情致和顽强的生存精神以及热烈欢愉的生命力量。这些便构成了他小说丰富的审美内涵，使他成为继李锐之后，又一位在这块充满生命原动力的“厚土”中，对民族心理、民族性格，对人的生存意识进行探求和反思，并在历史和现实的撞击点上观照生活的作家。
    李秀峰的这六篇小说，将现代文明的新潮与民族文化的传统，旧有的生存方式与渴望美好的生活愿望交织在一起，既叙述着一个个质朴、沉实而又流利的人物性格故事，又沉思着平凡普通的农民的命运。对农民旧的生活形态的缅怀和悲悯，胶合着现代的生命意识，形成了它们沉重的悲剧意蕴。
    李秀峰的这组小说的题材处理和表现技巧也许不如李杭育的《最后一个渔佬儿》，李锐的《厚土》，郑义的《远村》和扎西达娃的《系在皮绳扣上的灵魂》，但他是驾驭故事的好手，通过讲叙邰国梁（《心乐》）、“猫奶奶”（《猫奶奶》）、解武（《窑神》）那奇巧动人、惊心摄魄、回肠荡气的诱人故事，将认识、娱乐、教育与文学的功能非常平衡、健全地传达给了读者，从而自然而然地让读者在这几个人物身上去寻觅、思考小说的思想内容。在《心乐》、《猫奶奶》、《窑神》这三篇小说中，作者把这三个人物性格故事提炼得十分精辟生动，每个情节都纳入了人物命运的一定轨迹，每个细事末节都不是为讲故事而讲故事，而是揭示人物命运主题的必然环节和环环相扣的因果关系。作者的目的，不仅是让读者看到人物的自然行动，而且还想通过这种引人入胜的故事，促使读者追前猜后，探其内里，从而加深对人物品格和命运的了解，不由自主地介入到作者所讲述的故事里面去，使读者由爱看到关注，由好奇而关心，读罢之后，对阅历的人和事，有所思考，有所领悟。当然，编好一个能摄住读者兴趣的好故事并不难，难的是一个有价值、有深刻意蕴的高品位的故事。而这种有深刻意蕴的故事，阅读者并不能一下子看清和捕捉住它的根柢，但读完整个作品之后又分明能感受到它是富有思想内涵的存在。李秀峰的诡谲就在这里。他的这几篇小说在故事的通俗易懂、奇文瑰句之中渗透进潜在的哲学命题，这便支撑了他的这几篇故事的品位。《心乐》中的邰国梁，带给读者留连玩味的生存哲学的空间就极大。这个带有阿Ｑ意识的人物，将人出生在这个世界上，就是希望与失望、欢乐与痛苦的循环不已的人生感受与生存空虚说，和人既生活在人世间就各有各的活法凝结在一起，使作品获得了巨大的张力和诱人思索的魅力，小说的故事和人物因此也显得凝重。再如《牛变》，作者不过编造了一个神奇的、寓言体的杀牛给村民充饥解馋的荒诞故事，但故事最后引出“时至今日十三个年头了，七里河再没宰过牛，也再没斗过人……”的美中求善的意向，就使沉潜在故事中的生命本能和真善美的力量涨满在朴素的生活形态中。
    李秀峰的这组村闾小说写的都是平平常常的下层人物，但人物性格很见特色。他笔下的人物不仅是一些气质、性格的拼接物，而是圆的立体，就是背景人物也不是简单的扁平面孔。《窑神》中的解武是一个面对艰难的人生虽消极但不退却，冷峻地与腐败现象相抗衡的坚韧硬汉。他用自己的人格和生命有力地涂完了我行我素的最后一笔浓彩。他的生命虽然终结，但他那懒散中见刚毅的性格却在动态中凸现出来。
    《干仗》和《老婚》在李秀峰的这组小说中显得比较单薄。虽然作者在《干仗》和《老婚》中力图表现一种已被国人早已熟知的民族劣根性，但因思想大于形象，又因主题太直露、太浅显，因而削弱了作品的主题冲击力。然而这两篇小说的对话却是相当精彩的。《干仗》中二兄弟俩的对话形象而又生动；《老婚》中二亲旦和婵婵的对话妥贴而又亲切、自然。从这两篇小说的对话中不但可以听出人物的身份，而且还可以揣摩出人物的性格和行为以及思想感情。在当前一些以对话来推动情节发展的小说中，李秀峰的这两篇小说的对话是我看到的颇有动作性和感情内涵、个性色彩的。
