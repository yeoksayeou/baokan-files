France's Aerospatiale and West Germany's Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm (MBB) company are jointly developing a new series of fiber-optic missiles called "Polyphème" to enhance their defensive capabilities.

According to today's report in the French newspaper "Le Figaro," this missile has undergone several successful tests at the military base of Captiue in the Gironde province of southwestern France. It is expected to be put into actual combat use by 1995.

The new "Polyphème" fiber-optic missile can be used for various purposes, such as anti-tank, anti-helicopter, and submarine anti-aircraft missiles. The distinctive feature of fiber-optic missiles is that they are equipped with a miniature infrared "television camera." After the missile is launched, it can transmit the images it captures during flight through the fiber-optic cable it lays down. It can also receive navigation commands from the shooter based on the situation seen on the television screen, allowing the missile's navigation system to correctly identify and hit the target. When launched from a submarine, this missile is placed in a sealed high-pressure container. Once the container is launched above the water surface, it will automatically open and release the missile. The missile's navigation in both underwater and air environments utilizes this fiber-optic cable, transmitting navigation instructions from the submarine to the missile while simultaneously sending the missile's flight situation back to the submarine. Therefore, regardless of whether it is day or night, the "Polyphème" fiber-optic missile can accurately hit the target, becoming a powerful weapon for submarines to attack aerial targets.

　　法国西德合制新型光纤导弹
    新华社巴黎１月２日电  （记者茅瑞清）法国航空与航天公司和西德的ＭＢＢ公司正在联合研制名叫“波利费默”的新型系列光纤导弹，以加强国防自卫能力。
    据法国《费加罗报》今天报道，这种导弹已在法国西南部纪龙德省的卡普蒂厄军事基地进行了多次成功的试验，预计将在１９９５年开始投入实战运用。
    新型“波利费默”光纤导弹，根据用途可分为反坦克导弹、反直升机导弹和潜艇用防空导弹等。光纤导弹的特点是配备一架微型的红外线“电视摄像机”，可通过导弹发射后自身布下的光纤线来传送它在飞行时摄下的景物，又可通过这条光纤线接受射击者根据在电视屏幕上所看到的情况发出导航命令，使导弹的导航系统正确识别攻击目标并击中目标。从潜艇上发射时，这种导弹是放置在一个密封的高压容器里，当容器发射出水面后就会立即自动打开，释放出导弹。导弹在水下和空中的导航都利用这条光纤线，一面向导弹传送来自潜艇的导航指令，一面又把导弹飞向目标的情况送回潜艇。因此，不管白天还是黑夜，“波利费默”光纤导弹都能准确击中目标，成为潜艇攻击空中目标的有力武器。
