The repeatedly postponed world heavyweight boxing championship match has been confirmed to take place on February 25 in Las Vegas, USA. The current American boxing champion, Mike Tyson, will face a challenge from Britain's Frank Bruno. Both are black.

This championship bout has not only excited Americans but also attracted special attention from the British. This will be the highest-level boxing match between the two countries. British boxer Jem Mace won the "boxing champion" title in 1897, and this is the first time in 90 years that a British athlete has the opportunity to compete for the title.

In last year's June 27 championship defense match, Tyson knocked out his opponent Spinks in 91 seconds, winning approximately $20 million in prize money, setting a world record of earning about $220,000 per second. The 22-year-old Tyson is as strong as an ox, but he married a petite and elegant model and actress, Robin Givens, who is also black.

Tyson earned millions through boxing, naturally becoming wealthy and arrogant. Coupled with his violent temperament, less than a year after marriage, his wife filed for divorce in court on the grounds of being unable to endure abuse and demanded half of Tyson's property, which has made him very unhappy in recent months. Additionally, Tyson had a falling out with his manager over financial issues and also had disagreements with his coach, making him even more irritable. In early January, his wife was filming in Canada, and he suddenly flew from the US to negotiate with her. In the hotel, he encountered a few reporters' harassment, and in a fit of anger, he destroyed a $70,000 camera belonging to a Canadian television reporter. This incident proves that Tyson's mental state is extremely abnormal, especially before the big match, which is very unfavorable for his title defense.

In contrast, Britain's Bruno is methodically preparing for the match. At the end of last year, he flew to Arizona, USA, for adaptive training. Bruno is 28 years old this year and has loved boxing since childhood. At the age of 21, he officially became a professional boxer and has only lost twice in 30 matches.

Boxing experts say that Bruno's punches are not as powerful as Tyson's, and like most boxers, he usually adopts a defensive strategy at the beginning, which is his weakness. Therefore, it is said that his coach has already instructed him to take advantage of Tyson's current poor mental state, with a determination to win, and launch a full-scale attack from the start, which is sure to succeed.

Someone asked Bruno why he chose boxing as a career, and he replied frankly: "I don't fight for honor, I fight for a lot of money. Any professional boxer who doesn't fight for money must be crazy."

　　拳王与钱

    一再延期的世界重量级拳击冠军擂台赛已确定在２月２５日于美国拉斯维加斯市举行。现任美国的拳王麦克·泰森将受到英国的弗兰克·布鲁诺的挑战。他们两人都是黑人。
    这次拳王宝座争夺战不仅使美国人感到兴奋，英国人也特别关心。因为这将是英美两国最高级的拳击较量。英国拳击手费兹西蒙斯在１８９７年曾取得“拳王”称号，现在是９０年来英国选手第一次获得争霸的机会。
    泰森在去年６月２７日的拳王卫冕战中曾以９１秒钟将对手史平克斯击倒，赢得约２０００万美元奖金，创下每秒钟约赢２２万美元的世界纪录。２２岁的泰森体壮如牛，却娶了一个娇小玲珑的模特儿兼电影演员吉雯丝为妻，她也是个黑人。
    泰森靠拳头赚了千万家财，自然就财大气粗，加之他性情暴烈，结婚不到１年，他的妻子就以不堪虐待的理由到法院向他提出离婚，并要求分享泰森一半财产，这使他近几个月心境很坏。此外，泰森又和他的经理人在财务问题上闹翻，同教练也意见不合，于是更气上加气，情绪极为恶劣。１月上旬，他的妻子在加拿大拍电影，他突然从美国跑去要和妻子再谈判，在旅馆内遇到几个新闻记者的纠缠，一怒之下竟将加拿大电视台一名记者价值７万美元的摄相机毁坏。这足以证明泰森的精神状态极不正常，尤其是在大赛之前，对他的卫冕前途是很不利的。
    与泰森相反，英国的布鲁诺却按部就班地在进行赛前准备。去年末就飞到美国阿利桑那州作适应性训练。布鲁诺今年２８岁，自幼就喜欢拳击运动，２１岁时正式成为职业拳击手，在３０场比赛中只输过两次。
    拳击界人士说，布鲁诺的拳头没有泰森的拳头狠，而且像多数拳击者那样在开始时总是采取防守战术，这是他的弱点。所以据说他的教练已经要他利用泰森目前处于精神状态不佳的劣势，抱必胜的信念，一上场就全力进攻，这样肯定会成功。
    有人问布鲁诺为什么要选择拳击为职业，他很爽快地说：“我不是为荣誉打拳，我是为了去赢许多许多钱。任何职业拳击手如果不为钱去战斗，他一定是疯子。”
