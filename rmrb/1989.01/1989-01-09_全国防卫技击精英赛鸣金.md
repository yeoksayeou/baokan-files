    本报天津一月八日电  记者黄振中报道：全国防卫技击精英赛今天决出全部级别的冠军。河南队技高一筹，夺得男子三个级别冠军。新建的大连队不畏强手，使人刮目相看。
    比赛多次出现白热化，擂台上打得异常激烈。男子六十公斤级天津武警一队许家兴连击对手高长林五拳后，将其逼向台边，然后一脚踢下擂台。七十公斤级河南队刘军摔技出色，常将对手一次次压在擂台上，夺得第一名。大连队乔刚，腿法惊人，一踢一个准，摘取金牌。女子冠军决赛更为热闹，五十六公斤级的河南队张治敏和青岛的惠荣较技，时而起脚对踢，时而两拳对攻，先是打成一比一平，最后河南张治敏以微弱的优势争得金牌。
    在决赛中，裁判强调安全，一旦有一方选手体力不支，便中止比赛，宣布另一方获优势胜利，避免了意外事故。
