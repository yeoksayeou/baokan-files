In 1983, Chen Jiusheng, an assistant engineer at the Forestry Bureau of Jingde County in Anhui Province, left his job to contract the afforestation of 5,000 mu of barren hills. This became a major news story at the time. Five years have passed, and many people are concerned about his current situation and how his task is progressing. Recently, the authors visited relevant officials in Jingde and met with Chen Jiusheng and his wife, and also toured the lush pine forests that are beginning to take shape.

		What Was Heard Before the Visit

Before arriving in Jingde, in Xuancheng, officials from the Political Research Office of the Municipal Party Committee told us that Chen Jiusheng is now facing many difficulties. After arriving in Jingde County, we first saw an internal document stating: Over the past five years, Chen Jiusheng and his companions have slept in grass huts, drunk raw water, and fought day and night on the barren hills, enduring countless hardships. The once-barren hills are now lush and green, and the earliest planted pines are already 2.5 meters tall, growing vigorously. However, as the hills become greener, various discussions about Chen Jiusheng have increased, and his difficulties have also grown:

Firstly, at his peak, Chen employed 157 workers, and now there are still 30 to 40 people taking care of the forest. Some people say, "Chen Jiusheng really knows how to calculate, squatting in the mountains for two or three years and becoming a millionaire," "Chen Jiusheng is even more ruthless than capitalists and landlords..."

Secondly, some people think this is a private forest farm, and Chen is the farm owner. Others believe that this forest farm is part of socialist forestry, contracted for operation, similar to the household contract responsibility system in agriculture, and Chen is the leader in greening the barren hills.

Thirdly, to strengthen the management of young forests, it would cost at least 100,000 yuan, and up to 460,000 yuan, making it very difficult to secure the funds.

		Introduction by the County Forestry Bureau

A deputy director and the head of the High-Yield Forest Office introduced:

Chen Jiusheng's contract with the bureau for leave without pay for three years has expired, and last winter he returned to the office to resume his duties. To support him in continuing to manage the mountains, the bureau arranged for him to write the history of the forestry organization, without the need to attend the office;

The contracted task is nearly completed. Of the 4,000 mu listed as high-yield fast-growing forests, he has been given 110,000 yuan in afforestation subsidies as per regulations. He has also borrowed 125,000 yuan from the bank, and the regional forestry bureau has lent him 30,000 yuan interest-free;

In 1984, he was admitted to the party, and in 1987, he was promoted to engineer and was also elected as a member of the county political consultative conference;

His wife was originally a forest worker. Because Chen often works on the mountains, to take care of his family and children's education, she has been transferred to work in the county.

It seems that the county forestry bureau cares about and supports Chen Jiusheng. The deputy director said, Chen Jiusheng has endured many hardships in contracting the barren hills, has made contributions, and we support him; he has objections to the measurement of the afforestation area and insufficient nurturing funds, so he is often unhappy, and once he cried after drinking...

		The Wife's Account

When talking to us, she first thanked the county leaders and the forestry bureau leaders for their support and help to Chen's work and her family. However, various rumors not only affected Chen Jiusheng's enthusiasm but also hurt this hardworking woman's heart.

We asked her, why did Chen Jiusheng cry that time? She said, there are too many worries. Now there is no income, but people are already reaching out their hands. A worker in the forest farm had a fight with a villager, the worker ran away, and the villager demanded 1,000 yuan from Chen, threatening to fight to the death, saying, "I am a pauper and don't fear death, but you are a rich man and fear death." In the future, when the timber can be selectively cut and clear-cut, how will that day be?

		Attitude of the County Leaders

Both County Party Secretary Fang Cheng and County Magistrate Ouyang Jiyuan said, Chen Jiusheng's development of barren hills is not easy, the environment there is very harsh, the north wind howls in winter, and it is difficult to light an oil lamp at night, let alone plant trees, even going there to play is not easy. We have corrected his name at meetings, some say he is a "millionaire," we say the more such millionaires the better, the whole county still has more than 200,000 mu of barren hills, those with ability can all go to be millionaires. Some say employing workers is exploitation, we think such "exploitation" is not a bad thing. He leads thousands of households to the path of wealth, the social effect is good.

		Conversation with Chen Jiusheng

Four years ago, Wu Zhaoren came to this mountain. At that time, it was just a barren hill, and people lived in thatched huts. Now it is lush and green! Life is still hard, 2.5 kilometers from the nearest bus stop, no electricity or telephone, only a few makeshift houses to live in.

Old Chen indeed has both joys and sorrows. In another five years, selective cutting can be done. Even without much effort, in 15 years, 25,000 cubic meters of timber can be harvested, worth more than 10 million yuan! If carefully nurtured, the income can double!

However, his mood is very conflicted. He wants to do it but finds it difficult, wants to stop but can't bear to. Someone from Jiangsu is willing to buy the mountain for 8 million yuan, with the obligations signed with the forestry bureau to be taken over by the buyer. Chen can gain more than 6 million yuan by stopping work, which is quite tempting; a leader from the county people's congress suggested "not letting the rich water flow to others' fields," if selling, sell to county units, then use the 6 million yuan to go and contract development; the county stone factory also contacted, valuing the current assets of the forest farm at 8 million yuan, the factory will invest 4 million yuan, the forest farm will use this money to nurture the mountains, and in the future, the profits will be shared equally.

What should be done? Old Chen is hesitating, and it seems he leans towards the third plan: having a state-owned factory cooperate, the signboard is harder. But he has a new idea: it would be best to absorb county cadres, surrounding village cadres and masses, and workers from this farm to invest, everyone can get rich. We also heard his "unspoken words": sharing the benefits, no one will be jealous, the trees and himself will be safer.

During the conversation, he several times revealed the desire to "change the environment and live a stable, quiet life." He wants to go out to study for a few years, or work in an enterprise in another place, and indeed contacted Ningguo County, who is willing to hire him at a high salary.

We advised him to persist, "your career is on the mountain!" He agreed at the time. The mountain is green, will Old Chen leave the green career? If he doesn't leave, how will he continue?

### 荒山绿了也是愁

　　荒山绿了也是愁
    安徽  吴昭仁  周信生
    １９８３年，安徽旌德县林业局助理工程师陈菊生留职停薪承包绿化５０００亩荒山，曾成为轰动一时的大新闻。时过５年，他的近况如何？任务完成得怎样？为许多人所关心。笔者最近去旌德访问了有关同志，看望了陈菊生及其妻子，参观了初现葱茏的大片杉林。
    　　　　访问前的所闻
    未到旌德，在宣城就听地委政研室的同志说，陈菊生现在困难不少。到旌德县后，先看到一份内部材料，上写：５年里，陈菊生和他的同伴睡草棚，喝生水，日夜战斗在荒山上，吃尽了千辛万苦。昔日的荒山如今已一片葱绿，最早栽下的杉木已高达２．５米，长势喜人。可是随着荒山的绿化，对陈菊生的各种议论也越来越多，他的困难也越来越大：
    其一，最高峰时，陈曾雇工１５７人，如今仍留有三四十人在管护。有人说：“陈菊生真合算，在山沟里蹲两三年就成百万富翁了”，“陈菊生比资本家、地主还要厉害”……
    其二，有人认为这是私有林场，陈菊生是林场主。有的则认为该林场是社会主义林业的一部分，承包经营，与农业上的联产承包责任制类似，陈菊生是绿化荒山的带头人。
    其三，加强幼林管理，多则需投资４６万元，最少也要１０万元，资金很困难。
    　　　　县林业局的介绍
    一位副局长和丰产林办公室主任介绍：
    陈菊生与局订留职停薪合同３年已满，前年冬回机关复职，为照顾他继续管护山林，局里安排他写林业组织史，不需坐班；
    承包任务接近完成，列入速生丰产林的４０００亩，已按规定发给他造林补助费１１万元，本人向银行贷款１２．５万元，地区林业局无息借给他３万元；
    １９８４年他被吸收入党，１９８７年又晋升为工程师，还被选为县政协委员；
    他爱人原为林场工人，因为老陈常年在山上，为照顾其家庭和子女上学，她已被调到县城工作。
    看来，县林业局对陈菊生是关心支持的。副局长说，陈菊生承包荒山吃了不少苦，有贡献，我们支持他；他对造林面积测算有意见，抚育资金不足，因此常常不愉快，有一次酒后哭了……
    　　　　妻子的诉说
    在与我们谈话时，她首先感谢县领导和林业局领导对老陈工作以及她的家庭的支持和帮助。但是各种流言不仅影响了陈菊生的积极性，也刺伤了这位勤劳妇女的心。
    我们问她，陈菊生那次为什么哭？她说，忧虑太多，现在还没有收益，就有人伸手了。林场一个工人与村民打架，工人跑了，村民找老陈要１０００元，扬言不借就要拚刀子，还说：“反正我是穷光蛋不怕死，你是大富翁怕死”。以后要是木材能间伐和成片砍伐时，那个日子还怎么过呢？
    　　　　县领导人的态度
    县委书记方成和县长欧阳季元都说，陈菊生开发荒山不容易，那里环境很艰苦，冬天北风呼呼叫，晚上油灯难点着，别说栽树，就是去玩也不容易。我们在大会上为他正过名，有人说他是“千万元富翁”，我们说这样的富翁越多越好，全县还有２０多万亩荒山，有本领的都可以去当富翁。有人说雇工是剥削，我们看这样的“剥削”不是坏事。他带动千家万户走富路，社会效果好。
    　　　　与陈菊生的交谈
    ４年前吴昭仁来过这座山，当时光山秃岭，人住庵棚。如今已是满山葱绿！生活还是艰苦的，离最近的汽车站有２．５公里，没有电灯、电话，只有栖身的几间简易房子。
    老陈确实有喜有忧。再过５年可以间伐了，即便不下大力培养，１５年后也可成材２．５万立方米，价值１０００多万元！如果精心抚育，收益翻番！
    但是，他的心情很矛盾。欲干艰难，欲罢不忍。江苏有人愿出８０万元购买山林，与林业局所签合同的义务由买者承担，老陈就此歇手能获益６０余万元，挺诱人的；县人大有位领导建议“肥水不流外人田”，要卖就卖给县内单位，然后拿这６０万元再去承包开发；县砩石厂也联系过，以林场现有资产作价８０万元，厂方出资４０万元，林场以此资金抚育山林，将来获利两家平分。
    到底怎么办？老陈在犹豫，看来倾向于第三方案：有个国营厂合作，牌子硬些。但他又萌生一个新的念头：最好是吸收县里干部、周围乡村干群和本场工人入股，大家都发财。我们也听出他的“话外音”：利益均沾，没人红眼，树木和自己都较安全。
    谈话中他几次流露出想“换个环境，过段安稳、清静的日子”的情绪。他想出去学习几年，或者到外地企业去工作，也确实与宁国县联系过，人家愿以高薪聘他。
    我们劝他坚持下去，“你的事业在山上！”他当时是答应了。山绿了，老陈会甩开那绿色的事业吗？不甩，又怎么干呢？
