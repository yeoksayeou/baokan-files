Practice calls for reform, and reform calls for theory. The Daqiuzhuang Education Reform Research Institute was established today in a joint effort by Daqiuzhuang and the Tianjin Institute of Educational Sciences.

"The most important thing is not wealth but the cultural level of the people. The fundamental reason Daqiuzhuang was poor in the past was that the farmers lacked culture. To uproot poverty and achieve greater development, we must raise the cultural level of the next generation, change the small farmer mentality, and reshape the image of the farmers. In my lifetime, I want to create wealth for the country and leave talent for the next generation," said Yu Zuomin, general manager of the Daqiuzhuang Agricultural, Industrial, and Commercial Joint Venture Company. His words added luster to the establishment ceremony of the Education Reform Research Institute.

In terms of education, Yu Zuomin has the foresight of a farmer entrepreneur. Over the past 10 years, Daqiuzhuang has invested 23 million yuan in education, starting from kindergarten, primary school, and middle school, and taking the path of cultivating its own talents. Daqiuzhuang respects teachers and values education. Teachers enjoy high status and good benefits, with a monthly salary of no less than 400 yuan. Students' educational expenses are fully covered, and outstanding students can receive a substantial scholarship. In 1981, Daqiuzhuang implemented a policy that students must complete junior high school before they can start working. Currently, young men and women in their 30s have all completed junior high school education. In 1987, Daqiuzhuang changed its educational concept and conducted beneficial explorations in the reform from entrance examination-oriented education to quality education, combining the learning of cultural knowledge with vocational skills, making general education vocationalized.

Education reform requires scientific educational theory to guide it, and thus the Education Reform Research Institute was born. The institute is located in Daqiuzhuang School, with research objects including preschool children, primary school students, middle school students, and adults. The research content is quite broad, including educational development strategies, educational evaluation, curriculum setting, overall optimization of education, and changes in educational structure. The research method is "field research," where different experts and scholars are invited according to different research topics. These researchers can go to Daqiuzhuang and other regions for fieldwork and then return to their places of residence to write papers and reports.

　　实践呼唤改革　改革呼唤理论
    大邱庄新办教育改革研究所
    本报天津１月５日电  记者孟晓云报道：教育改革呼唤着教育理论，大邱庄和天津教育科学院联合创办的教育改革研究所今天宣布成立。
    “比财富更为重要的是人的文化素质。大邱庄过去受穷最根本的原因是农民没有文化。要想拔掉‘穷’根，再有更大的发展，就要使下一代提高文化素质，改变小农意识，再塑农民形象。在我的有生之年，愿为国家创财富，给后代留才能。”大邱庄农工商联合公司总经理禹作敏这番话，使教育改革研究所成立大会增色不少。
    在办教育方面，禹作敏不乏农民企业家的远见。１０年来，大邱庄投资教育２３００万元，从幼儿园、小学、中学抓起，走自己培养人才的路。大邱庄尊师重教，教师地位高，待遇优厚，月工资不低于４００元；学生上学一切费用全免，优秀者还可得一笔可观的奖学金。１９８１年，大邱庄制定了初中不毕业不准上班的制度，目前３０岁左右的男女青年已普及了初中文化。１９８７年，大邱庄人改变教育观念，在由升学教育转向素质教育的改革中进行有益的探索，把学习文化知识和学习职业技术结合起来，使普通教育职业化。
    教育改革要靠科学教育理论来指导，教育改革研究所便应运而生。该研究所设在大邱庄学校，研究对象包括幼儿、小学生、中学生及成人。研究内容涉及较广，如教育发展战略、教育的评估、课程的设置、教育的整体优化、教育结构的变革等。研究方式为“走研式”，根据研究课题的不同，而聘请不同方面的专家学者。这些研究人员可以到大邱庄及其它地区考察，然后回到自己的居住地写出论文报告。
