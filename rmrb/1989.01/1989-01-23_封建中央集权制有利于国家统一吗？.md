For a long time, the academic community has generally held a positive or even eulogistic attitude towards the feudal centralized system, one of the reasons being that the feudal centralized system is beneficial to national unity. I believe this view is one-sided. Historical facts show that the feudal centralized system is an important cause of national disintegration.

The disintegration of the feudal society can be divided into two situations. The first is that large-scale peasant uprisings disrupted the unified feudal dynasty, resulting in a disintegrated situation, such as the end of the Qin, Han, and Tang dynasties. The second situation is that the invasion of minority ethnic groups into the Central Plains led to a disintegrated situation, such as the Five Barbarians and Sixteen Kingdoms, and the confrontation between the Song, Liao, and Jin dynasties. In fact, these two situations are ultimately related to the centralized system.

The outbreak of large-scale peasant uprisings is inseparable from the existence and strengthening of the centralized system. Regarding this point, many scholars have made discussions, and I will briefly summarize it. Under the centralized system, the central government gathers all the power of the local areas to the top, thus making the affairs of the central government increasingly complicated. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a huge bureaucracy; to ensure the implementation of the emperor's and the central government's will, it is necessary to force the local areas and the people to obey the central government, and thus it is necessary to establish a huge army. The huge bureaucracy and army both need to be supported by taxes collected from the people by the state. As Marx pointed out in "The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte": "Taxes are the life source of the bureaucracy, the army, the clergy, and the court, in a word, they are the life source of the entire administrative power structure. A strong government and heavy taxes are the same concept. Small-scale land ownership, by its nature, is the foundation for the existence of countless omnipotent bureaucrats." This means that the centralized system is based on the small peasant economy, "it creates a uniform level of all relationships and individuals across the country. Therefore, it also makes it possible for a supreme center to act equally on the various parts of this unified whole." (Marx and Engels Selected Works, Vol. 1, p. 697) That is to say, the centralized system has the same effect on each individual peasant household. The centralized system is based on the small peasant economy, and the heavy taxes needed to maintain the huge bureaucracy and army under the centralized system cause the peasants to be impoverished and become refugees. When they have nowhere to go, they rise up in rebellion, igniting the flames of peasant uprisings.

The disintegrated situation caused by minority ethnic groups entering the Central Plains is ultimately inseparable from the feudal centralized system. If a dynasty is rich and powerful, it either conquers and assimilates the surrounding minority ethnic groups or keeps them out of the country. If the dynasty is corrupt and weak, it is conquered by the minority ethnic groups or forms a confrontational and autonomous situation with them. Reviewing the history of the feudal society, we can find that the disintegrated situation caused by minority ethnic groups entering the Central Plains mostly occurs during the weak period of a dynasty. And whether a dynasty is rich and powerful is directly related to the number of self-supporting farmers it controls. As mentioned earlier, the implementation of the centralized system inevitably requires a large number of bureaucrats and soldiers, and supporting these bureaucrats and soldiers requires collecting a large amount of taxes from the peasants. The government's collection of a large amount of taxes often leads to the bankruptcy of self-supporting farmers, which inevitably weakens the national power, making it impossible to resist the attacks of the surrounding minority ethnic groups, thus leading to the appearance of a disintegrated situation.

In summary, the feudal centralized system can concentrate the scattered material and human resources of the country to form a powerful military force and achieve unity; but at the same time, it inevitably undermines the foundation of this military and economic power—the small peasant economy, causing the depletion of soldiers and financial resources, turning strength into weakness, and unity into disintegration. The centralized system has long kept ancient China in a cycle of periodic unity and disintegration, starting with unity but ending with disintegration. We should not only see its side of benefiting national unity but also see its side of promoting national disintegration.

### 封建中央集权制有利于国家统一吗？

　　封建中央集权制有利于国家统一吗？
    郝铁川
    长期以来，学术界对封建中央集权制大都持肯定乃至歌颂态度，理由之一是封建中央集权制有利于国家统一。我认为这种看法是片面的。历史事实表明，封建中央集权制是国家分裂的重要原因之一。
    封建社会的国家分裂，可分两种情况。第一种是大规模的农民战争打乱了统一的封建王朝，从而出现了分裂局面，如秦末、汉末、唐末等。第二种情况是少数民族的入主中原造成了分裂局面，如五胡十六国、宋辽金对峙等。其实，这两种情况归根到底都与中央集权制有关。
    大规模农民起义的爆发，与封建中央集权制的存在与强化密不可分。关于这一点，已有不少学者作过论述，我只简要概括一下。在中央集权制下，中央把地方的一切权力都集中到上面，这样就使中央政府的事务日益繁多。因此，必然要建立一个庞大的官僚机构；为了保证皇帝与中央的意志的贯彻，强迫地方与人民对中央的服从，又必然要建立一支庞大的军队。庞大的官僚机构与军队，都要靠国家向人民征敛来的赋税养活。如马克思在《路易·波拿巴的雾月十八日》中所指出的：“赋税是官僚、军队、教士和宫廷的生活源泉，一句话，它是行政权力整个机构的生活源泉。强有力的政府和繁重的赋税是同一个概念。小块土地所有制按其本性来说是全能的和无数的官僚立足的基地。”这就是说，中央集权制建立在小农经济基础之上，“它造成全国范围内一切关系和个人的齐一的水平。所以，它也就使得有可能从一个最高的中心对这个划一的整体的各个部分发生同等的作用。”（《马克思恩格斯选集》第１卷，第６９７页）也就是说，中央集权制国家对一家一户的个体农民所发生的作用是同等的。中央集权制是以小农经济为立足之地，而中央集权制为了维持庞大官僚机构与军队生存的巨额赋税，使小农家破人亡，沦为流民。在他们走投无路之时，便揭竿而起，点燃农民起义的烈火。
    少数民族入主中原所造成的分裂局面，说到底也与封建中央集权制密不可分。如果一个王朝国富兵强，对于周围少数民族或者是征服、同化，或者是拒之于国门之外。如果这个王朝已腐败衰弱，则被少数民族征服，或与其形成对峙、割据称雄的局面。统观封建社会的历史，我们可以发现，少数民族入主中原所引起分裂局面出现的情况，大都发生于一个王朝的衰弱时期。而一个王朝是否国富兵强，与它所控制的自耕农数量的多少有直接关系。前面说过，实行中央集权制，势必要有众多的官僚和军队，而养活这些官僚和军队要靠向小农征收大量的赋税，政府征收大量的赋税则往往引起自耕农的破产，必然会使国家力量衰弱，这样又无法抗拒周边少数民族的进攻，从而造成分裂局面的出现。
    总之，封建中央集权制能够把全国分散的物力和人力集中起来，形成强大的军事力量，实现统一；但同时又不可避免地瓦解了这种军事力量和经济力量的基础——小农经济，使兵源、财源枯竭，强大转变为弱小，统一变为分裂。中央集权制长期使古代中国处于周期性的统一与分裂的循环圈内，它以统一开始，却以分裂而衰败。我们不能只看到它有利于国家统一的一面，还应看到它具有促使国家分裂的一面。
