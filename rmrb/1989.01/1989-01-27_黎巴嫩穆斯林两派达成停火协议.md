Lebanese Muslim Factions Reach Ceasefire Agreement

BEIRUT, Jan. 25 (Xinhua) — According to the Syrian Arab News Agency, the two factions of the Lebanese Shia Muslims— the pro-Syrian "Amal" Movement and the pro-Iranian "Hezbollah"—reached a ceasefire agreement on January 25. The ceasefire went into effect at 8:30 GMT on the same day.

The ceasefire agreement was reached after a three-day mediation by Syrian and Iranian officials. Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati visited Damascus for this purpose. After completing his mission, he will return to his country later this year.

The bloody conflict between the two Shia Muslim factions in Lebanon erupted in late last year in the southern suburbs of Beirut and southern Lebanon. More than 100 people were killed and over 200 injured in the conflict.

　　黎巴嫩穆斯林两派达成停火协议
    新华社大马士革１月２５日电  据叙利亚阿拉伯通讯社今天报道，黎巴嫩什叶派穆斯林的两派——亲叙利亚的“阿迈勒”运动和亲伊朗的“真主党”２５日达成一项停火协议，并从当天格林威治时间８∶３０生效。
    这项停火协议是在叙利亚和伊朗官员为期３天的调解后达成的。伊朗外长韦拉亚提为此访问了大马士革。在完成这项使命后，他将于今年离开这里回国。
    黎巴嫩什叶派穆斯林两派的流血冲突是去年年底在贝鲁特南郊和黎巴嫩南部爆发的。在这场冲突中有逾１００人丧生，２００多人受伤。
