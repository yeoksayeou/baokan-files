Title: Speaking of Dedication Is Not Just Singing a High-Tune

The spirit of dedication has become somewhat unfashionable in the minds of many people, including some Communist Party members. It is said that these are the days of "realizing one's self-worth."

At least for qualified Communist Party members, the spirit of dedication should not become outdated. Communist Party members, of course, have their own value orientations, but there is one common value: to work for the interests of the people, and if necessary, to sacrifice some personal interests (even one's life) to achieve the interests of the people. This is what makes Communist Party members worthy of the name.

On January 15, the People's Daily published a report on the front page titled "The Pursuit Under the Wuling Mountains," which introduced five young Communist Party members led by Huang Dianyu. When they were transferred, they did not return to their hometowns but voluntarily requested to go to the poorest county in Sichuan, Youyang County, located in the Wuling Mountains, to establish a pharmaceutical factory. They are determined to start a business in hardship and plant a "money tree" for the local people.

Some people have maliciously said: "Going to Shenzhen is to make money, going to the mountains is to sing a high-tune." Huang Dianyu and the other five have withstood ridicule and sarcasm, and have also experienced the hardships of starting a business. They are determined to "show the world: coming to the mountains to help the poor is not just about making money." They did not sing a high-tune, but they showed a noble spiritual realm and the spirit of dedication of Communist Party members. Those who ridicule others for talking about dedication as "singing a high-tune," do they have the courage to sing such a "high-tune" themselves?

Huang Dianyu and the other five finally established a small pharmaceutical factory half a year ago, bringing hope of prosperity to the local farmers. Their achievements are far from being "outstanding" or "glorious." However, in an era where some people use any means to make money and the corrupt wind within the Party is disheartening, their actions have indeed brought a force of upward struggle to people.

May more Communist Party members have the spirit of dedication like Huang Dianyu and the others. This way, our country's affairs will be easier to handle.

　　讲奉献并非唱高调
    华军
    奉献精神在不少人、包括一些共产党员的心目中不怎么时髦了，据说如今是“实现自我价值”的年头。
    至少对合格的共产党人来说，奉献精神不应过时。共产党人当然也有各自的价值取向，但有一条共同的价值观，就是要为群众谋利益，必要时可以牺牲一些个人利益（直至生命）以成全群众的利益。这就是共产党人所以叫共产党人的可贵之处。
    １５日人民日报头版的一篇通讯《武陵山下的追求》，报道了以黄殿宇为首的五位年轻共产党员，在转业之际，不回家乡，自愿要求到地处武陵山区的四川最贫困的酉阳县办药厂，决心艰苦创业，为当地老百姓“栽棵摇钱树”。
    有人风言风语：“到深圳是淘金，到深山是唱高调”。黄殿宇等五人经受住了讽刺挖苦，也经历了创业之艰辛，决心“让世人看看：到深山来扶贫还是发财”。他们没有唱高调，但表现出了崇高的思想境界，表现出了共产党人的奉献精神。那些讽刺别人讲奉献是“唱高调”的人，自己有没有勇气唱一曲这样的“高调”呢？
    黄殿宇等五人好不容易在半年前办成一个小小的制药厂，为当地农民带来了致富的希望。他们的业绩远说不上“显赫”与“辉煌”。但是，在有些人不择手段捞钱、党内腐败风气令人伤感的今天，他们的作为毕竟给人带来了奋发向上的力量。
    愿更多的共产党人有黄殿宇等人的奉献精神，这样我们国家的事就会好办一些。
