Edition: 1

The State Council Office has recently issued a notice to local governments regarding the strengthening of agricultural chemical management and the severe crackdown on the production and sale of fake and substandard agricultural chemicals. The notice requires all levels of government and relevant departments to strengthen agricultural chemical management, take effective measures, thoroughly clean up and rectify the production and circulation links of agricultural chemicals, and severely crack down on the production and sale of fake and substandard agricultural chemicals.

The notice states that agricultural chemicals must continue to be registered according to regulations. Agricultural chemicals that have not been approved and registered are not allowed to be produced, sold, or used. All levels of agricultural chemical inspection agencies and technical supervision departments must strengthen technical supervision and daily sampling inspection work.

The notice states that starting from February 1 of this year, a production permit (or provisional production permit) system will be implemented. The production permit (or provisional production permit) for agricultural chemicals (including raw agricultural chemicals, agricultural chemical processing, formulation, packaging, etc.) will be issued by the Chemical Industry Ministry. After obtaining the agricultural chemical production permit (or provisional production permit), enterprises should apply to the industrial and commercial administration for a new business license. New enterprises should handle the above procedures and then obtain the business license. Starting from March 1, enterprises without a new business license will not be allowed to produce.

The notice states that the State Council has decided to implement a specialized management system for agricultural chemicals starting from January 1 of this year. Specialized management units are not allowed to purchase and sell agricultural chemicals that are not registered and do not have a production permit (or provisional production permit). In the future, those who sell fake and substandard agricultural chemicals (including ineffective agricultural chemicals) will have their business licenses revoked, and the directly responsible persons will be severely punished according to the law.

The notice requires strict management of agricultural chemical prices. The ex-factory and sales prices of agricultural chemicals will be managed in a tiered manner. The prices (including planned prices and the highest limit prices outside the plan) will be determined by the price departments, and sales units must operate with clear pricing. The industrial and commercial administration should regularly inspect the activities of agricultural chemical production and sales units. Enterprises producing agricultural chemicals without a production permit (or provisional production permit) and non-specialized agricultural chemical units selling agricultural chemicals should be shut down. Any department or unit importing agricultural chemicals must continue to implement the planned management and permit approval system.

The notice also requires all levels of government and relevant departments to strongly support agricultural chemical production.

    严惩制造销售假劣农药活动     
    ２月１日起一律实行农药生产许可证制度
    据新华社北京１月２６日电  国务院办公厅最近向各地发出《关于加强农药管理，严厉打击制造、销售假劣农药活动的通知》，要求各级政府和有关部门，加强农药管理，采取有力措施，认真清理整顿农药生产、流通环节，严厉打击制造、销售假劣农药行为。
    通知指出，对农药要按照规定继续实行登记。未经批准登记的农药，不得生产、销售和使用。各级农药检定机构和技术监督部门，要加强技术监督和日常抽样检测工作。
    通知说，从今年２月１日起，一律实行生产许可证（或准产证）制度。农药生产（包括农药原药、农药加工、复配、分装等）许可证由化工部统一签发。企业取得农药生产许可证（或准产证）后，应向工商行政管理机关申请换发营业执照。新办企业按上述规定办理后，领取营业执照。从３月１日起，无新营业执照的企业一律不准生产。
    通知说，国务院已决定，从今年１月１日起，对农药实行专营。专营单位不准收购和销售未经登记和没有生产许可证（或准产证）的农药。今后，再销售假劣农药（包括失效的农药）的，要吊销其营业执照，并对直接责任者，依法从严惩处。
    通知要求严格管理农药价格。农药的出厂、销售价格实行分级管理。由物价部门核定出厂和销售价（包括计划内价格和计划外最高限价），销售单位必须明码标价经营。工商行政管理机关要经常检查农药生产和经营单位的活动。无生产许可证（或准产证）生产农药的企业以及非农药专营单位销售农药的，应一律取缔。任何部门、任何单位进口农药，都要继续实行计划管理和许可证审批制度。
    通知还要求各级政府和有关部门要大力支持农药生产。
