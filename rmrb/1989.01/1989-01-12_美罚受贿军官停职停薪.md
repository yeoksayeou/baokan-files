The U.S. Department of Defense announced today that it has suspended the duties and salary of Navy officer Stuart Berlin, who is accused of bribery. The department is also considering similar actions against other officials involved in the case.

Berlin is accused of conspiring with industrial consultant William Parkinson and Defense Department employee Fred Lackner to engage in bribery and embezzlement with Teradyne Inc. of California. A federal grand jury confirmed the charges against them on January 6 and handed them over to the court for trial.

The Defense Department also stated that it has halted the signing of a new contract for aircraft identification system test equipment with Teradyne Inc. and will revoke the military order rights of other arms contractors involved in the bribery case.

Reports indicate that approximately 20 arms contracting companies are currently under investigation.

　　美罚受贿军官停职停薪
    新华社华盛顿１月１０日电  美国国防部今天说，它已停止了被指控犯有贿赂罪的海军官员斯图亚特·柏林的工作和停发工资，并考虑对卷入这个案件的其他官员采取类似的行动。
    柏林被指控同工业顾问威廉·帕金以及国防部雇员弗雷德·拉克纳合伙与加利福尼亚的泰雷德因电子公司密谋行贿受贿，诈骗窃取国家资财。美国联邦大陪审团１月６日已经确认对他们提出的指控，并将他们交由法庭审判。
    国防部还说，它已停止同泰雷德因电子公司签订一项新的飞机鉴定系统试测设备合同，并将取消卷入贿赂案件的其他军火承包商获取军事订单的权利。
    据报，大约有２０多家军火承包公司正受到调查。
