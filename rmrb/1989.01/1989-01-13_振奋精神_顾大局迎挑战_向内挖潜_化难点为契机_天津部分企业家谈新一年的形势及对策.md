The new year has begun, and Tianjin's entrepreneurs are facing a new situation with the implementation of economic rectification and austerity measures. They have their own set of challenges and strategies. How do they feel about the current situation, and what are their plans for the future?

In a series of New Year's greetings, the general manager of Tianjin Flying Pigeon Bicycle Group Company, Xing Qifu, told the reporter: "From a macro perspective, economic rectification and austerity measures are certainly beneficial for enterprises. For example, reducing investment in fixed-asset projects will increase investment in technological upgrades, and the withdrawal of low-quality products will ensure that limited raw materials are used for high-quality products. However, this process will take time, and we don't know how long it will last. What we do know is that the sharp increase in upstream raw material prices has resulted in a reduction of 279 million yuan in profits for Tianjin's bicycle industry, which is the biggest challenge we have ever faced."

This commander of a company producing 6.58 million bicycles a year remains calm and clear-headed:

"You've been to the six major department stores in the city, right? They are currently selling 4,000 new bicycles. Ordinary bicycles are priced at 208 yuan each, but several models with beautiful designs, attractive paint jobs, and light, fast performance, such as the 83-type, 84-type, and new Spruce cars, are selling for 288 yuan and 298 yuan, and are still in high demand. This is the market. Optimizing product structure, labor combination, and enterprise management is the way to overcome internal difficulties. The reduction in profits at the beginning of last year was 240 million yuan, but through a year of increasing revenue and cutting costs, we achieved a profit and tax of 300 million yuan by the end of the year. I believe that after overcoming this year, we will reach a new level."

Similar to Xing Qifu, many entrepreneurs feel a sense of urgency. Recently, some entrepreneurs held a discussion in the Tianjin Daily:

"The Longcheng brand color TVs and black-and-white TVs have always been in short supply in the market, and we have managed to pay off 89 million yuan in loans. However, this year we need 260,000 color picture tubes, and so far we have only secured tens of thousands. Black-and-white TVs sold 300,000 units last year, mainly to rural areas, and individual businessmen played a significant role in distribution. However, now some places want to completely eliminate 'speculators'..." Longcheng Electronics Company Manager Du Chongqian is quite hesitant.

There are many difficulties, and much to consider. The transition from the old to the new year is not easy. However, the reporter knows that these entrepreneurs have not been idle. In the face of new challenges, they are revitalizing their spirits, considering the big picture, facing difficulties head-on, and striving to turn difficulties into opportunities.

On relying on policy preferences, entrepreneurs have different views. The manager of Zhonghuan Hongda Electronics Company, Ye Xintai, believes: "Enterprises need to overcome short-term behavior and rely on technological progress. Otherwise, the bank will cut off funding. In the past, we often only compared quality with foreign products. But why do some gold and silver awards still not go out? The problem lies in the fact that foreign products have lower costs, while ours are out of control. The contract targets for enterprises should not only be profits and tax payments, but also cost reduction and efficiency improvement."

"Through rectification and austerity, enterprises should be pushed to a new level." Zhang Lichang, who has been a factory director for many years and is now the deputy mayor of Tianjin in charge of industry, said this when accepting the reporter's interview.

He said, of course, from a macro-control perspective, different enterprises will not be treated the same way. However, for enterprises, this is a good time to deepen reforms. Tianjin's energy consumption per 10,000 yuan of output value is 2.8 tons, while Shanghai's is 2 tons. Tianjin has a lot of potential for energy saving and potential tapping.

　　振奋精神　顾大局迎挑战  向内挖潜　化难点为契机
    天津部分企业家谈新一年的形势及对策
    本报讯  记者肖荻报道：新年伊始，面对治理整顿的新局面，天津市的企业家们颇不轻松。他们有什么苦辣酸甜？打算怎样举手投足？
    在互致新年祝贺的电话中，天津飞鸽自行车集团公司总经理邢起富对记者说：“从宏观讲，治理整顿自然对企业有利。比如，压缩基建投资会加强技术改造投入，杂牌车下马会使有限的原材料用于名牌车。但这要有个过程，这过程有多长？还不知道。眼下已知道的是，上游原材料的暴涨，使天津自行车行业减利因素达２．７９亿元，这是我们有史以来遇到的最大困难。”
    这位指挥年产６５８万辆产品的“自行车大王”，依然是那样处变不惊，思路清晰：
    “你到本市６大商场去了吗？那里正展销４０００辆新型车。普通二六车２０８元一辆，但是几种造型美、油漆漂亮、性能轻快的８３型、８４型和新式斯普瑞克车，卖到２８８元和２９８元，依然很抢手，这就是市场。优化产品结构、优化劳动组合、优化企业管理，这就是我们从内部消化困难的出路。去年初的减利因素是２．４亿元，经过一年增收节支，年底实现利税３个亿。相信，挺过今年，将会跃上一个新台阶。”
    与邢起富相似，不少企业家感到了一种逼人的严峻。不久前，一些企业家在天津日报座谈：
    “长城牌彩电、黑白电视机市场上一直供不应求，一举还清８９００万元贷款。可是今年需要彩色显像管２６万支，目前仅解决了数万支。黑白电视机去年３０万台主要销农村，个体户在贩运中起了大作用，但是现在有些地方要一刀切掉‘倒爷’……”长城电子公司经理杜崇谦颇费踌躇。
    难题种种，思虑万千。辞旧迎新，颇不轻松。可是，记者知道，这些企业家并没闲着。在新的挑战面前，他们振奋精神，既顾全大局，又正视困难，力争化难点为契机。
    在依靠政策优惠上，企业家们所见不一。中环宏达电子公司经理叶新泰的看法是：企业要克服短期行为，就应依靠技术进步。不然，银行一卡就完。过去我们和外国产品往往只比质量。但为什么有些金牌、银牌仍出不去？问题在国外产品成本低，而我们成本失控。企业承包目标不应仅是利税、还贷，还要降低成本，提高效益。
    “要通过治理和整顿，把企业逼上一个新水平。”当过多年厂长、现任天津主管工业副市长的张立昌，在接受记者采访时这样开宗明义。
    他说，当然，从宏观控制上对不同企业是不会一刀切的。但是，对于企业来讲，现在正好腾出手深化改革。天津万元产值能耗是２．８吨，而上海，万元产值能耗为２吨，天津的节约挖潜实在是大有潜力。
