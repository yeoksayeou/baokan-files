This batch of fake seeds has ruined us.

In the first half of 1987, our township seed station purchased 1.5 million kilograms of corn seeds from the Darenhe Township seed station in Zhucheng City. The sales contract specified that the seed station guarantees the purity of the supplied "Yan Dan 14" corn seeds at 90%. If any issues are found in the autumn, all losses will be compensated.

By the end of June, we discovered that these corn seeds sprouted and began to tassel before reaching 2 feet. The Yantai Agricultural Science Institute identified that these corn seeds were not "Yan Dan 14" at all. For this reason, we sent telegrams and letters to the Darenhe Township seed station, the Darenhe Township head, and the Zhucheng City mayor, requesting them to come and handle the issue, but we received no response.

Last year on August 6, our township seed station filed a lawsuit with the county court, which accepted the case and sent personnel to Zhucheng City for investigation on September 3. However, the responsible person at the Darenhe Township seed station avoided meeting with them.

Later, our county court reported this case to the Qingdao Intermediate People's Court, which deemed that the case should be handled by the Zhucheng City People's Court. We sent 13 letters and telegrams to the Zhucheng City People's Court and relevant departments, requesting prompt trial, but the issue remained unresolved.

This batch of fake seeds caused us enormous economic losses, with a total reduction in yield of 1.2 million kilograms, resulting in a loss of 480,000 yuan. We demand that the relevant departments handle this fake seeds case and compensate for our economic losses.

After investigation, our court found that from October 1986 to March 1987, the Darenhe Township seed station took advantage of the shortage of corn seeds, purchasing 360,000 kilograms of fake corn seeds, falsely claiming they were high-quality corn seeds "Yan Dan 14," and selling them at high prices to 13 counties and cities including Laixi, Tancheng, and Longkou, earning more than 260,000 yuan in illegal profits. The responsible person at the seed station, Wang Guihai, knowing they were fake seeds, passed them off as genuine, deliberately facilitating speculative activities for enterprises, and illegally earning a particularly large amount of money, constituting the crime of speculation. However, this speculative criminal activity was carried out collectively, and Wang did not personally enrich himself. After being apprehended, he showed a good attitude of admitting guilt. Based on this, our court, in accordance with relevant provisions of the criminal law, sentenced Wang Guihai to three years in prison, suspended for three years; confiscated more than 10,800 yuan in illegal earnings from the seed station and a car purchased with the illicit money. On April 21, 1988, with the approval of the city's disciplinary inspection commission, Wang Guihai was expelled from the party. The purchasing units had sent professional and technical personnel to re-examine the seeds during the purchase and did not raise any objections. The selling unit is no longer responsible for the economic losses caused by the seeds after they were shipped out. At the same time, the illegal earnings from the Darenhe Township seed station's speculation have all been confiscated and turned over. We believe that there is no need to pursue further economic compensation from the selling unit. To prevent similar incidents from happening again, we suggest that the municipal government and relevant departments rectify the seed market, strengthen the breeding of high-quality seeds and seed management, and severely crack down on speculative activities to maintain Zhucheng's reputation for high-quality seeds.

### 这批伪劣种子把我们坑苦了

　　这批伪劣种子把我们坑苦了
    １９８７年上半年，我们乡种子站从诸城市大仁和乡种子站购进了１．５万公斤玉米良种。购销合同规定：这个种子站保证所供“烟单１４”玉米种纯度９０％，如果秋后发现问题，包赔一切损失。
    到了６月底，我们发现这些玉米种出土后，不足２尺就抽穗。经烟台农科所鉴定，这些玉米种根本不是“烟单１４”。为此，我们先后向大仁和乡种子站、大仁和乡乡长、诸城市市长发了电报和信函，请求来人处理，但一直杳无音信。
    去年８月６日，我们乡种子站向我县人民法院起诉，县法院受理了此案，并于９月３日派人去诸城市调查。可是，大仁和乡种子站负责人避而不见。
    后来，我县人民法院将此案向青岛市中级人民法院汇报，青岛市中级人民法院认为，此案由诸城市人民法院审理为妥。我们向诸城市人民法院及有关部门先后发了１３封信和电报，请求尽快审理，但问题迟迟得不到解决。
    这批伪劣种子，使我们蒙受了巨大的经济损失，总减产１２０万公斤，损失４８万元。我们要求有关部门审理这起伪劣种子案，赔偿我们的经济损失。

    经我院审理查明：１９８６年１０月至１９８７年３月，大仁和乡种子站乘玉米种紧缺之机，收购伪劣玉米种３６万多公斤，冒充优质玉米良种“烟单１４”，先后高价售给莱西、郯城、龙口等１３个县、市，从中牟利２６万多元。种子站负责人王桂海明知是伪劣种子，却以次充好，故意为企业单位投机倒把活动开放绿灯，非法牟利数额特别巨大，已构成投机倒把罪。但此投机倒把犯罪活动均由集体共同实施，王个人未中饱私囊，归案后认罪态度较好。据此，我院依照刑法有关规定，判处王桂海有期徒刑３年，缓刑３年；没收这个种子站非法所获现金１０８００多元及用赃款购买的１３０汽车一辆。１９８８年４月２１日，经我市纪律检查委员会批准，开除王桂海的党籍。购种单位在购种时，曾派专业技术人员对种子进行复验，并没有提出异议。售种单位不再负责种子调出后所造成的经济损失。同时，大仁和乡种子站投机倒把的非法所得，均已没收上缴。我们认为，不应再对售种单位追索经济损失。为杜绝类似事情的发生，我们建议市政府及有关部门整顿种子市场，加强良种繁育和种子管理工作，严厉打击投机倒把活动，以维护诸城的良种声誉。
