Title: The Fury of the Desert

The desert, how long has it been since you were born? Your body is covered in scars, your face wrinkled, but I do not see your weariness, your decay. What I see is only anger! Of course, you have also had moments of calm, at which time you are like a gentle woman. But I know, you are brewing a greater storm.

Every time a sandstorm rages, you cover the sky and the earth, and the remaining white thorns, the wormwood, the red willows, and the poplar trees—every bit of green hope—are all swallowed up.

For this, you are cursed, generation after generation. You do not explain, you do not refute, because you can understand this helpless curse.

Yes, when have you not wished that you were still the sea—that would be such a beautiful sea: azure waves, white sails, and seagulls...

When did the earth's crust suddenly change; for millions of years, wind and fire eroded it. Thus, you became a desert. But you struggle in your steadfast belief. You yearn for rain, you long for the fresh rain in the vast forests of the south, the rain that gives life to all things.

Yet, the rain god is so harsh and stingy with you. Day after day, year after year, it is still the scorching sun, mercilessly drying up the last trace of moisture you have; it is still the dry wind, blowing away the last bit of dampness you hold inside. What remains is still the curses of the people...

The desert will not be crushed by these curses. You are still angry, clenching your fists, twisting your body, shouting day and night, forming those sand dunes that rise and fall like ocean waves. A mirage appears, showing you the green forests you long for. You long for: you—are—the—sea!

You have been angry for millions of years, you have aged. But in your bones, there is an undying storm, there are waves that will never disappear, because, you were once the sea!

　　大漠的愤怒
    朱超
    大漠，诞生已有多少时光了？遍体伤痕，满脸皱纹，但我看不出你的憔悴，衰竭。我看到的只是愤怒！当然，你也有过平静，这时候，你就像个温顺的女人。可我知道，你这是在酝酿一场更大的风暴。
    每当砂石的风暴骤起，你遮天盖地，残存的白刺和芨芨草，红柳和白杨树——一点点绿的希望都淹没了。
    为此，你被人诅咒，世世代代被人诅咒。你没有解释，没有反驳，因为你能理解这无可奈何的诅咒。
    是的，你何曾不希望你还是海——那将是多么美丽的海：蔚蓝色的波浪上，片片白帆，点点海鸥……
    什么时候，地壳骤变；几千万年，风蚀火燎。于是，你成了沙漠。但你在坚强的信念中挣扎。你渴求雨，渴望南方大林莽中那清新的雨，给万物以生命的雨。
    然而，雨神对你这样苛刻吝啬。日复一日，年复一年，依旧的炎炎烈日，无情地挤去了你仅存的一缕潮气；依旧的燥风，吹走了你内藏的一丝湿润。留下的依旧是人们对你的诅咒……
    大漠不会被这诅咒压垮。你依旧愤怒着，攥着双拳，扭动身躯，无日无夜地呐喊，形成那像海浪般起伏的沙丘，海市蜃楼幻现出你希求的绿色大林莽。你希求：你——是——海！
    你愤怒着，几千万年，你老了。可在你的骨子里，却有着不能泯灭的狂潮，有着不会消失的巨浪，因为，你曾经是海！
