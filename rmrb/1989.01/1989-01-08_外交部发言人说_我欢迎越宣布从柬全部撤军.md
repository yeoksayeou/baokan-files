　　外交部发言人说
    我欢迎越宣布从柬全部撤军
    新华社北京一月七日电  外交部发言人今天在这里说，中国对越南宣布至迟在今年九月从柬埔寨全部撤军“表示欢迎”。
    发言人是在答记者问时作上述表示的。这位记者问：“你对越南宣布今年九月以前从柬埔寨全部撤军有何评论？中国是否同意与越南进行直接会谈？”
    发言人说：“一月六日，越南外交部宣布至迟在一九八九年九月从柬埔寨全部撤军，尽管它提出了一些条件，但毕竟比其原先宣布的撤军时间前进了一步，我们表示欢迎。”他指出，如果越南切实履行其诺言，真正从柬埔寨撤军，这将有助于有关各方达成一项全面政治解决柬埔寨问题的办法。这位发言人还表示，“至于同越南直接会谈的问题，在适当时候我们会考虑的。”
