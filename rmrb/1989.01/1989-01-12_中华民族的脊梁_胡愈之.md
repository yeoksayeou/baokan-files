The Spine of the Chinese Nation—Hu Yuwei

Xia Yan

Engels, in the introduction to his "Dialectics of Nature," discussed the European Renaissance, saying: "This was the greatest progressive transformation that humanity had ever experienced, an era that required giants and produced giants—giants in thought, passion, and character, giants in versatility and erudition." China also experienced a great progressive transformation 70 years ago, namely the May Fourth New Culture Revolution, followed by the people's democratic revolution led by the Communist Party of China against imperialism and feudalism. This great era required giants—and indeed, it produced a group of giants who excelled in thought, knowledge, and talent. In the intellectual community, Hu Yuwei was such a giant who rose to the occasion.

After the April 12 incident in 1927, I returned to Shanghai from Japan. Introduced by Yang Xianjiang, I met Yuwei. Our first meeting was brief, and soon he fled to France. At that time, I had just joined the party and was young and impetuous. Once, chatting with Xianjiang, I thought that Yuwei, as the de facto editor of "Eastern Magazine," should not have left his post in times of danger. Xianjiang thought for a moment, then took out a copy of the April 14, 1927, "Commercial News" from his bookshelf and said softly, "Read this 'Protest Letter.' It was drafted by Yuwei on the night of April 12."

This was a powerful manifesto: "The citizens of Shanghai had just rejoiced in being liberated from the bandit armies of Fengtian and Lu, but yesterday in Zhabei, a unprecedented massacre unfolded. The army, baptized by the Three Principles of the People, opened fire on unarmed crowds, killing and injuring over a hundred. Even the Butcher of Nanjing, Duan Qirui, was not so brutal, and the British executioners of the May 30 massacre were not so savage. Yet our sacred revolutionary army could commit such atrocities. Witnessing this beastly spectacle, it is impossible to remain silent."

This protest letter was addressed to Cai Yuanpei, Wu Zehui, and Li Shizeng, signed by seven people: Zheng Zhenduo, Hu Yuwei, Zhang Xicheng, Feng Qixing, Zhou Yutong, Wu Juenong, and Li Shicen. At that time, the bloodstains on Baoshan Road had not yet dried, and Shanghai was under the shadow of white terror. To publicly publish such a protest letter, exposing Chiang Kai-shek's massacre of revolutionaries, indeed required great courage. It was also because the executioner Chen Gun found out that this protest letter was drafted by Yuwei that he wanted to harm him, and Yuwei heeded Zheng Zhenduo's advice and left Shanghai. This incident happened over sixty years ago, and at that time, Yuwei had not yet joined the party. I remember that during the early days of the War of Resistance, Zhou Enlai once told me: "Chinese intellectuals are courageous and have backbone. After the April 12 incident, there are two things I will never forget: one is the 'Protest Letter' written by Hu Yuwei and Zheng Zhenduo, and the other is Guo Moruo's 'Look at Chiang Kai-shek Today.' These are the fearless deeds of upright Chinese intellectuals."

Yuwei stayed in France for three years, studying international law at the Faculty of Law of the University of Paris and researching international issues. He also participated in the progressive workers' movement in France. I heard that Ba Jin's works published in the "Novel Monthly" in Shanghai were also introduced by Yuwei. In 1930, he traveled through Germany and Poland to the Soviet Union and returned to Shanghai in February 1931, just after the martyrdom of the five heroes, Yu Dawei and Hu Yepin. On one hand, the white terror was severe, and on the other hand, the left-wing opportunism of Wang Ming was rampant. Yuwei cleverly used his social connections to publish "Impressions of Moscow" in the "Social and Education" magazine, which was run by the Kuomintang. This book caused a sensation in the intellectual community and was reprinted five times in one year. Lu Xun wrote: "This year, I encountered two books that I could read without much caution: one is Hu Yuwei's 'Impressions of Moscow,' and the other is 'Soviet Observations.'"

Not long after the September 18 incident, around the end of October, I met Xia Kuaizhen at the Yamazaki Bookstore. He invited me to have dinner at the Kaiming Bookstore. This was the first time in four years that I met Yuwei again. The guests at the table were all colleagues from the Kaiming Bookstore, including Ye Shengtao, Zhang Xicheng, Wu Juenong, Xu Diaofu, and Song Yunbin. At that time, Yuwei was already a famous expert on international issues. The Kuomintang was implementing a policy of non-resistance, handing over the three northeastern provinces to Japan, while Western Europe and the United States were in the midst of the Great Depression. During the meal, it was inevitable that some pessimistic sentiments would be expressed, but Yuwei keenly pointed out that Roosevelt's "New Deal" was beginning to show results, and the contradictions between European and American imperialism and Japanese imperialism would inevitably intensify. Therefore, the most important issue at the moment was to unite the people and oppose the Kuomintang's anti-communist and anti-Soviet policies. He kept smoking and spoke softly, saying that Japan's invasion of the Northeast ultimately aimed to attack the Soviet Union, so we should resume diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and seek its aid. Half a century ago, he foresaw the contradictions between the Eastern and Western imperialists. His foresight gave me great inspiration.

After the Battle of Shanghai, I had more opportunities to meet Yuwei, sometimes at Wu Juenong's house, sometimes at the Kaiming Bookstore. After I joined the film industry, I once discussed with him the matter of Zhang Shichuan and Zhou Jianwen of the Mingxing Film Company inviting me, Qian Xingcun, and Zheng Bochi to write scripts. He was very interested and asked me if they knew about our political background. I replied frankly: "It is precisely because they know we are members of the Left League that they want us to help them come up with ideas and write scripts." He suddenly became happy and said to me, "You are right. This shows that capitalists who are not in power can cooperate on the premise of patriotism and resistance to Japan. Of course, their progress is limited." Why was Yuwei, who usually did not show his emotions, so interested and happy about this matter? Because this matter precisely proved his early foresight of an impending new situation, namely: when Japan launched a large-scale invasion of China and the country was in crisis, not only the petty bourgeoisie but also the national bourgeoisie could be won over to the side of resisting Japan and opposing Chiang. After September 18, the people generally opposed the Kuomintang's policy of non-resistance, and the call to "stop the civil war and unite to resist Japan" grew louder. However, the left-wing opportunists led by Wang Ming did not see this situation and still raised unrealistic slogans such as "the middle class is the most dangerous enemy" and "arm the defense of the Soviet Union." It was also during this period that the Left League launched a debate against the "third kind of people," and Yuwei's articles advocating the winning over of the broad masses and the united resistance to Japan, published in "Eastern Magazine" and "Life Weekly," were also considered right-wing opportunism and were criticized by name in party publications. In the October 1931 issue of "Red Flag Monthly," issue 23, "How the various reactionary factions supported the National Government during the Manchurian Incident," Yuwei was even regarded as a figure of the Third Party Reformist. What is admirable is that Yuwei was not intimidated by the wrong criticism. He continued to publish articles, pointing out that under the attack of Japanese imperialism, the national bourgeoisie began to be dissatisfied with the Kuomintang, and there were those within the Kuomintang who "did not want to be slaves." The Nineteenth Route Army's resistance in Shanghai, led by Cai Tingtai and Jiang Guangnai, proved this point, and this Battle of Shanghai also received the support of the leading figures of the Shanghai business community. All this also showed that the ruling Kuomintang was not a monolithic bloc. I still remember that he published articles several times, believing that after the economic recovery of the United States, the capitalist countries of the West would not be content to let Japan swallow China alone, so the contradictions within the capitalist world would gradually emerge. In the early 1930s, when the Wang Ming line was dominant, it was indeed rare for someone in the progressive cultural community to have such a realistic and far-sighted vision.

It was during this period that he participated in the "Chinese League for the Protection of Civil Rights" initiated by Song Qingling, Cai Yuanpei, Lu Xun, and Yang Xianfu, actively rescuing communists and patriots arrested and persecuted by the Kuomintang; assisted Zhuang Weijun in running "Life Weekly" and "Life Bookstore," and through Zhang Zhiji, he got to know the "pro-Soviet faction" in the Kuomintang, Sun Ke. Later, he became the editor-in-chief of the Chinese department of the "Havas News Agency," the only news agency in the Far East, and made acquaintances with many internationally renowned figures in Shanghai at that time, such as Louis Aylor, Stella Stewart, and Israel Epstein. In this way, he could understand the political and economic situation at home and abroad through various channels, and with his tireless energy and powerful pen, he wrote a large number of articles with unique insights. It was precisely because of his unique interpersonal relationships and vigorous work, in the autumn of 1933, the Communist Party of China recruited him as a special party member and participated in the work of the Special Bureau. The Special Bureau was directly under the leadership of the Central Committee and had no connection with the underground party, so his joining the party was unknown even to us. In the winter of that year, the Kuomintang's secret organization, the "Anti-Communist Alliance of the Film Industry," destroyed the Yihua Film Company and the Liangyou Bookstore. We planned to organize a joint statement by cultural figures to protest to the authorities. I took the list to Cai Chouhou for discussion. Cai Chouhou told me that under the current circumstances, I think it is better not to include Hu Yuwei's name, let him be more detached, which might be more beneficial. Chouhou was a good friend of Yuwei, first working in the Central Special Bureau and later transferring to the Far Eastern Bureau of the International Intelligence Agency, so his reminder made me guess that Yuwei might have other tasks.

From 1933 to February 1935, the underground organization of the party in Shanghai suffered three major setbacks, resulting in heavy losses. It is often said that the left-wing line of Wang Ming caused the Red Army to lose 90% and the underground party to lose 100%. In fact, just in Shanghai, although the Central Shanghai Bureau and the Jiangsu Provincial Committee were severely damaged, the party organization was not completely destroyed. The trade unions (Ma Shugu), the Youth League (Chen Guodong), the Cultural Commission (Zhou Yang), and the Special Bureau (Wang Xuewen) were still fighting on their own and continuing their work. Especially the peripheral organizations related to the underground party, they took advantage of the rising national contradictions and launched a large-scale anti-Japanese and anti-Chiang movement. At this critical moment, we who experienced it will never forget the immeasurable great contributions made by Yuwei. In his later years, Yuwei wrote in "My Memoirs": "Some party members who stayed in Shanghai to continue the struggle were already in a state of fighting on their own, and work was very difficult. In this year, in addition to continuing to write articles to promote anti-Japanese and national salvation, I also made every effort to connect with people who were determined to resist Chiang and fight against Japan, trying to first ferment and organize an anti-Japanese and national salvation organization in the cultural community, so that the national salvation movement could have a new rise in the situation of universal silence. At the same time, I also devoted great enthusiasm to developing the business of Life Bookstore, expanding this piece of land for anti-Japanese and national salvation propaganda. Following the 'Literature' magazine launched in 1933, in September 1934, 'World Knowledge,' 'Tai Bai,' and 'Translations' were also launched, and in 1935, 'Women's Life' was launched. These magazines were mostly organized and planned by me." This is a profound contribution to modern revolutionary history and cultural history. During this period, three progressive bookstores were established in Shanghai: "Reading Life," "New Knowledge," and "Life Bookstore." The first two were run by underground party members Xu Xuehan and Huang Luofeng, while Life Bookstore was run by Zhuang Weijun with the support and planning of Yuwei. These bookstores published many magazines and books that were well-received by readers, especially some classic works of Marxism, which were published by these bookstores at the risk of their lives during this period. During this period, he talked to me several times, saying that the situation had changed, and it was not enough to rely on enthusiasm and courage. Publishing books and magazines should first consider the needs and acceptance level of the readers, "one must reason calmly and not lecture from a high position." When he prepared to publish "World Knowledge," he specifically invited me for a talk. He said, "After Hitler's Nazi Party came to power in Germany, the international situation is changing rapidly. Now we urgently need a magazine that specializes in introducing and commenting on international knowledge. Without this knowledge, it is impossible to correctly understand the current situation." He wanted me to write an article in the inaugural issue. I used the pen name Wei Yi and wrote an article on American films. Ye Shengtao once said that Yuwei had four virtues: first, his spirit of self-study; second, his organizational ability; third, his spirit of love; fourth, his friendly affection. This is the most authentic evaluation of Yuwei's conduct. Shengtao said, "Yuwei has established many organizations, planned many magazines and books, and he can inspire friends to work with him. He is good at discovering the strengths of friends and making friends play to their strengths. When the organization and magazines and books take shape, he often lets friends continue, and he starts new construction. He has such extraordinary organizational ability, so the number of achievements is rare to see." Not only was Life Bookstore and its many magazines "organized and planned by him," but more importantly, the predecessor of the China Democratic League, the National Salvation Association, the Shanghai Cultural Salvation Association at the beginning of the War of Resistance, the Young Journalists Association, the International News Agency, and the "Nanyang Daily" and so on, were all carefully planned and organized by him. Of course, we must not forget that in the winter of 1937, after the fall of Beijing and Shanghai, he bravely stayed in Shanghai, organized manpower and resources, quickly translated and published Snow's "Red Star Over China," and then rushed around, obtaining the support of Mr. Cai Yuanpei, and published the voluminous "Complete Works of Lu Xun." Such fearless courage and extraordinary organizational ability, as well as the spirit of working hard and struggling, in modern intellectuals, can truly be said to be unparalleled.

In 1934, Lu Xun wrote in "Random Thoughts from the Thatched Cottage": "From ancient times, we have had people who work hard, people who struggle, people who plead for the people, people who seek the truth at the cost of their lives.... Even the so-called 'official history,' which is written for the sake of emperors, kings, and princes, often cannot cover up their glory. These are the backbone of China." Yuwei is such a giant, the backbone of the Chinese nation, and he is truly worthy of the title.

　　中华民族的脊梁——胡愈之
    夏衍
    恩格斯在《自然辩证法·导言》中论及欧洲文艺复兴运动时说：“这是一次人类从来没有经历过的最伟大的进步的变革，是一个需要巨人而且产生了巨人——在思维能力、热情和性格方面，在多才多艺和学识渊博方面的巨人的时代”。中国历史上也经历过一次最伟大的进步的变革，这就是７０年前的五四新文化革命，和接着而来的中国共产党领导的反帝反封建的人民民主革命，这个伟大的时代需要巨人，——这个时代也的确产生了一批思想、学识、才艺上卓绝的巨人，——在知识界，胡愈之同志就是这样一个应运而生的巨人。
    １９２７年四·一二事件之后，我从日本回到上海，经杨贤江同志的介绍，我认识了愈之同志，初次见面，谈得不多，不久他就逃亡到法国去了，这一年我刚入党，年少气盛，一次和贤江同志闲谈，认为当时愈之是《东方杂志》实际上的主编，在危难时刻他不该离开这个岗位，贤江同志沉思了一下，然后从书架上找出一份同年４月１４日的“商报”，低声说：“你看看这篇‘抗议信’，这是四·一二那一天晚上愈之起草的”。这是一篇掷地有金石声的檄文：“上海市民方自庆幸得从奉鲁土匪军队下解放，不图昨日闸北，竟演空前之屠杀惨剧。受三民主义洗礼之军队竟向徒手群众开枪轰击，伤毙至百余人，三一八案之段祺瑞无此横暴，五卅惨案之英国刽子手无此凶残，而我神圣之革命军人，乃竟忍心出之。目睹此率兽食人之惨剧，万难苟安缄默”。这封抗议信是写给蔡元培、吴稚晖、李石曾的，签名者７人：郑振铎、胡愈之、章锡琛、冯次行、周予同、吴觉农、李石岑。当时，宝山路上的血迹未干，正是白色恐怖笼罩上海的时刻，公开发表这样一封抗议信来揭露蒋介石屠杀革命者的罪行，的确是需要有很大的勇气的，也由于刽子手陈群查明了这封抗议信是愈之起草的而要加以暗害，他才听从了郑振铎的劝告，才离开了上海。这件事距今已经六十多年了，当时愈之还没有入党。记得抗战初期周恩来同志曾和我说过：“中国知识分子是有勇气、有骨气的，四一二事件之后有两件事我一直不会忘记，一是胡愈之、郑振铎他们写的‘抗议信’，二是郭沫若写的‘请看今日之蒋介石’，这是中国正直知识分子的大无畏的壮举”。
    愈之同志在法国耽了三年，在巴黎大学法学院学习国际法，研究国际问题，参加了法国的工人进步运动，我还听说过，巴金在上海《小说月报》上发表作品，也是经过愈之介绍的，１９３０年他经过德国、波兰到了苏联，１９３１年２月回到上海，正碰上柔石、胡也频等五烈士遇难之后不久，一方面白色恐怖严重，另一方面又是王明左倾机会主义全盛时期，愈之巧妙地运用他的社会关系，在国民党办的《社会与教育》杂志上发表了《莫斯科印象记》。这本书哄动了知识界，一年之内重印了五版，鲁迅先生写过：“这一年内，也遇到了两部不必用心戒备，居然看完了的书，一是胡愈之先生的《莫斯科印象记》，一就是《苏联见闻录》。”
    九·一八事变之后不久，大约是１０月下旬，我在内山书店遇到夏丐尊先生，他约我到开明书店去吃饭，这是相隔四年之后再次和愈之见面，同席的都是开明书店同人，有叶圣陶、章锡琛、吴觉农、徐调孚、宋云彬等，当时愈之已经是著名的国际问题专家了，当时国民党实行不抵抗政策，把东三省拱手送给了日本，而西欧和美国还处在经济大萧条之中，席间谈到国事，难免会流露出一些悲观情绪，而愈之却非常敏锐地指出罗斯福的“新政”已初见成效，欧美和日本帝国主义之间的矛盾必然会日益加剧，所以当前最重要的问题，首先是团结人民，反对国民党的反共反苏政策。他不断地抽烟，低声细语地说，日本侵略东北，最终的目的在于进攻苏联，所以我们应该和苏联复交，争取苏联的援助。早在半个世纪之前他就预见到东西帝国主义之间的矛盾。他的远见卓识，给了我很大的启发。
    淞沪战争之后，我和愈之有了更多见面的机会，有时在吴觉农家里，有时在开明书店，我参加了电影工作之后，有一次我和他谈起明星电影公司的老板张石川和周剑云约我和钱杏邨、郑伯奇写剧本的事，他很有兴趣地问我，他们知不知道你们的政治背景。我坦然地说：正因为他们知道我们是左联的人，所以才要我们帮他们出主意，写剧本的，他忽然高兴起来，对我说，你们做得对，这就说明不当权的资本家也可以在爱国抗日的前提下合作的，当然他们的进步是有限度的。平时喜怒不形于色的愈之为什么对这件事感到兴趣和高兴呢，因为这件事正好证明了他早已预见到的一种即将到来的新的形势，这就是：当日本大举侵略中国，国难当头的时刻，不仅小资产阶级，连民族资产阶级也可以争取到反日反蒋这方面来的事实。九·一八之后，人民群众普遍地反对国民党的不抵抗政策，“停止内战、联合抗日”的呼声日益高涨，而王明左倾主义者，却看不到这一形势，还在提“中间派是最危险的敌人”和“武装保卫苏联”这一类不切实际的口号——也就在这个时期，“左联”发动了一场反对第三种人的论争，因此愈之在《东方杂志》和《生活周刊》上发表的主张争取广大群众，联合抗日的文章，也被认为右倾机会主义，在党刊上对他进行点名批评——１９３１年１０月的《红旗月报》第２３期“满洲事变中各反动派别怎样拥护着国民政府”一文中，居然把愈之看作是第三党改组派的人物。值得钦佩的是愈之并没有被错误的批评吓倒，他还是不断地发表文章，指出在日本帝国主义的进攻中，民族资本家开始对国民党不满，国民党内部也有“不愿做奴隶的人”，蔡廷锴、蒋光鼐的十九路军在上海奋起抗战，就证明了这一论点，而这一场淞沪战争又得到了上海工商界头面人物的支持，这一切也就说明了当政的国民党也不是铁板一块。我还记得他不止一次发表文章，认为美国经济复苏之后，西方资本主义国家决不会甘心让日本独吞中国，所以资本主义世界之间的矛盾也将逐渐显露。在三十年初期王明路线占上风时期，在进步文化界能有这种实事求是的远见卓识，实在是难能可贵的。
    正是在这个时期，他参加了宋庆龄、蔡元培、鲁迅、杨杏佛等发起的“中国民权保障同盟”，积极营救被国民党逮捕和迫害的共产党人和爱国人士；协助邹韬奋办《生活周刊》和《生活书店》，通过张志让先生认识了国民党中的“亲苏派”孙科，接着担任了法国在远东唯一的通讯社《哈瓦斯社》的中文部编辑主任，结识了当时在上海的许多国际知名人士，如路易·艾黎、史沫特莱、伊罗生等，这样，他可以通过各种渠道，了解到国内外的政治、经济形势，发挥他不知疲倦的精力和如椽的笔力，写出了大量有独到见解的文章，也正是由于他的这种特殊的人际关系和旺盛的工作能力，１９３３年秋，中国共产党吸收他为特别党员，参加了特科工作，特科归党中央直接领导，和地下党不发生任何联系，所以他的入党连我们这些人也是不知道的。这一年冬，国民党特务组织“电影界铲共同志会”捣毁了艺华电影公司和良友图书公司，我们打算组织文化界知名人士联名发表宣言，向当局提出抗议，我拿了这个名单和蔡叔厚商量，蔡叔厚对我说，在目前这种情况下，我看胡愈之还是不列名为好，让他超脱一点，可能更有好处。叔厚是愈之的好友，先在中央特科，后来转到国际远东情报局工作，所以他的这一提醒，我曾猜想到愈之可能另有其他的任务。
    从１９３３年到１９３５年２月，党在上海地下组织连续遭到三次大破坏，损失重大，过去常说，王明左倾路线使红军损失了９０％，地下党损失了１００％，事实上，单说上海，尽管中央上海局和江苏省委都遭到了严重的破坏，但党组织并没有全被消灭，工会（马纯古等）、青年团（陈国栋等）、文委（周扬等）、特科（王学文等）也还在人自为战，继续工作，特别是和地下党有关系的外围组织，却正利用了民族矛盾上升的机会，掀起了一场声势浩大的抗日反蒋运动。在这严峻时刻，我们这些身历其境的人永远也不能忘记愈之同志所作出的难以估计的巨大的贡献。愈之晚年写的《我的回忆》中有这样一段话：“留在上海坚持斗争的一些党员，已都处于人自为战的状态，工作十分困难。这一年里，我除继续写文章宣传抗日救国外，还努力多方联络有志反蒋抗日的人士，力图在文化界首先能酝酿组织起一个抗日救亡的团体，以使在万马齐喑的形势下，救亡运动能有新的兴起。同时，我也以极大的热情来发展生活书店的业务，以扩大这一块宣传抗日救国的文化阵地。继１９３３年创刊的《文学》杂志后，在１９３４年９月，又创办了《世界知识》、《太白》、《译文》等刊物，１９３５年还创刊了《妇女生活》。这些刊物大都是我联系筹划下办起来的。”这是近代革命史、文化史上的一项影响深远的贡献。这个时期在上海新建了三家进步书店，即“读书生活”，“新知”和“生活书店”，前两家是地下党人徐雪寒、黄洛峰办的，生活书店则是邹韬奋在愈之同志的支持和筹划下办起来的，这几家书店出了许多深受读者欢迎的刊物，出版了许多进步书籍，特别值得一提的是一些马克思主义的经典著作，都是这个时期由这几家书店冒着风险出版的。在这一段时期内，他不止一次和我谈过，现在形势变了，要联合抗日，单凭热情和勇气是不够的，出书和办杂志，首先要考虑到读者的需要和他们的接受水平，“一定要心平气和地说理，切不可居高临下地训人”，当他筹备出版《世界知识》的时候，他单独约我谈话，他说：“希特勒的纳粹党在德国登台之后，国际形势瞬息万变，现在急需要有一本专门介绍和评论国际知识的杂志，缺乏这方面的知识，就不可能正确地认识当前的形势。他要我在创刊号上写文章，我就用韦彧的笔名，写了一篇论美国电影的文章。叶圣陶先生说过愈之同志的四个长处，一是他的自学精神，二是他的组织能力，三是他的博爱精神，四是他的友爱情谊，这是对愈之立身行事的最真切的评价，圣陶先生说：“愈之兄创建过许多团体，计划过许多杂志和书刊，他能鼓动朋友们跟他一起干，他善于发现朋友们的长处，并且使朋友们发挥各自的长处，等到团体和杂志书刊初具规模，他往往让朋友们继续干下去，自己又开始新的建设。他有这样非凡的组织能力，所以建树事业之多，能比得上他的似乎少见”。不仅生活书店和它刊行的许多杂志是他“联系筹划下办起来的”，更应该说，中国民主同盟之前身的救国会，抗战初期的上海文化界救亡协会，青年记者协会，国际新闻社以及《南侨日报》等等，也无一例外地都是他精心策划、组织起来的，当然，我们更不能忘记，１９３７年冬，京沪沦陷之后，他奋不顾身地留在上海，组织人力物力，迅速翻译出版了斯诺的《西行漫记》，接着又奔走呼号，得到了蔡元培先生的支持，出版了卷帙浩繁的《鲁迅全集》。这种大无畏的勇气和非凡的组织能力，以及埋头苦干，拚命硬干的精神，在近代知识分子中，真可以说是无可伦比的。
    １９３４年，鲁迅先生在《且介亭杂文》中说：“我们从古以来，就有埋头苦干的人，有拚命硬干的人，有为民请命的人，有舍身求法的人，……虽是等于为帝王将相作家谱的所谓‘正史’，也往往掩不住他们的光耀，这就是中国的脊梁。”愈之同志就是这样一位巨人，中华民族的脊梁，他是当之无愧的。
