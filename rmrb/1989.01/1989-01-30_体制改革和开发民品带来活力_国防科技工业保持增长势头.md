	The pace of transformation towards a military-civilian integration in China's defense science and technology industry has accelerated. In 1988, the industry's total industrial output value grew by 17.4% compared to 1987, and the total profit increased by 62.7%.

	Despite facing challenges such as rising raw material prices, tight energy and material supplies, and difficulties in coordination and matching, the defense science and technology industry undertook a series of adjustments and reforms in product structure, operational methods, and management systems last year. By actively promoting internal contracting, optimization, bidding, and introducing competitive mechanisms, the advantages and potential of military enterprises were further leveraged. Preliminary statistics show that labor productivity per capita increased by 23% compared to 1987.

	In 1988, the nuclear industry, aerospace, aviation, and ordnance sectors saw a 40% increase in civilian product output compared to the previous year, accounting for 59.5% of the total industrial output value of the defense science and technology industry. These sectors developed over a thousand key civilian products that share similar structures, processes, and technologies with military products. These products provided a range of technological upgrading equipment for industries such as energy, transportation, textiles, machinery, chemicals, building materials, and medical care.

　　体制改革和开发民品带来活力
    国防科技工业保持增长势头
    据新华社北京１月２９日电（记者许志敏）我国国防科技工业加快向军民结合型转变的步伐，去年工业总产值比１９８７年增长１７．４％，利润总额增长６２．７％。
    国防科技工业去年在原材料价格上涨，能源、物资供应紧张，协作配套困难的情况下，对产品结构、经营方式、管理体制等进行了一系列调整和改革。通过积极推进内部承包、优化组合、招标等措施，引入竞争机制，使军工企业的优势和潜力进一步得到发挥。据初步统计，去年与１９８７年相比，全员劳动生产率增长２３％。
    去年，核工业、航空、航天、兵器行业完成民品产值比上年增长４０％，占国防科技工业总产值的５９．５％。这些行业开发出上千种与军品结构相同、工艺相近、技术相通的支柱民品，为能源、交通、纺织、机械、化工、建材、医疗等行业提供了一批技术改造装备。
