Opening up to the world marks a historical turning point. In the past decade of reform, China's economy has taken a significant step towards the global stage. The total value of imports and exports in the past ten years is nearly three times that of the previous twenty-nine years.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Beijing on January 16, the decade of reform and opening up has brought about a historical shift in China's economic life. Due to the development of foreign economic and trade relations, the domestic and international markets have become more closely linked, thus ending a long history of closure and semi-closure.

In just ten years, China's foreign economic and trade relations have initially formed a new pattern of multi-channel, multi-level, and multi-form exchanges and cooperation in goods, technology, capital, and services, opening up a broad new horizon. According to statistics from the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, the total value of imports and exports in 1988 reached $79.42 billion, an increase of 2.8 times compared to 1978. Over the ten years of reform, the cumulative total value of imports and exports has reached $505.1 billion, equivalent to 2.98 times the cumulative total of the 29 years before the reform and opening up. The structure of export commodities has also been optimized, with the proportion of industrial products in exports increasing from 46.5% in 1978 to 69.1%. The number of countries and regions with which China has established economic and trade relations has also increased from several dozen to over 180.

Utilizing capital from capitalist countries to develop China's production and export services has long been a taboo in China's foreign economic and trade work, even considered an act of "selling out the country." Since 1979, this taboo has been broken, and the country has used various means to utilize foreign loans totaling over $32 billion. Nearly 15,000 joint ventures, cooperative enterprises, and wholly foreign-owned enterprises have been approved. From 1978 to October 1988, a total of 3,525 advanced technology projects were introduced, with a contract value of approximately $25.6 billion. Overseas contract engineering and labor cooperation have signed a total of 7,050 contracts in 117 countries and regions, with a total value of over $10 billion, and dispatched over 300,000 labor service personnel, earning a good reputation internationally.

The development of foreign economic and trade relations has promoted the development of domestic agriculture and industry. China's annual imports of production materials account for 80% of the total imports, mainly domestic short-supply products, scarce resources, and advanced applicable technologies and equipment. For example, the import volume of steel, natural rubber, wool, timber, and fertilizers accounts for 20% to 80% of domestic production, accelerating China's economic development. It is estimated that for every $1 billion of imported materials, domestic industrial output value can increase by $1.5 billion. For every $1 billion of exported industrial products, domestic output value can increase by $5.8 billion. In 1987 alone, through imports and exports, the increase in domestic industrial output value was approximately $380 billion.

　　敞开国门迎来历史性转折
    十年改革我国经济走向世界
    十年进出口总额近三倍于前二十九年
    据新华社北京１月１６日电  １０年改革开放，我国经济生活发生了一个历史性转折，由于对外经济贸易的发展，国内和国际两个市场相互联系更加紧密，从而告别了封闭和半封闭的漫长历史。
    短短１０年时间，我国对外经济贸易初步形成了商品、技术、资金、劳务等多渠道、多层次、多种形式的对外交流和合作的新格局，开辟出前景广阔的新天地。据经贸部统计，１９８８年全国进出口总额达到７９４．２亿美元，比１９７８年增长了２．８倍。改革１０年，全国累计进出口总额达５０５１亿美元，相当于改革开放前２９年累计总额的２．９８倍。出口商品结构也趋于优化，工业制品出口比重已由１９７８年的４６．５％上升到６９．１％。已建立经济贸易关系的国家和地区也由几十个发展到１８０多个。
    利用资本主义国家的资金发展我国生产和出口劳务，长期以来是我国对外经贸工作的禁区，甚至被视为“卖国行为”。从１９７９年开始打破这块禁区以来，全国通过各种方式实际使用国外贷款累计达３２０多亿美元，已批准的中外合资、合作经营企业和外商独资经营企业已近１．５万家。１９７８年至１９８８年１０月引进先进技术项目共３５２５项，成交合同额约２５６亿美元。对外承包工程和劳务合作已在１１７个国家和地区累计签订合同７０５０项，总金额１００多亿美元，派出各类劳务人员３０万人次，已在国际上赢得了较好的信誉。
    对外经济贸易的发展，促进了国内工农业生产的发展。我国每年进口的生产资料占进口总量的８０％，主要是国内短线产品、紧缺物资和先进适用的技术设备。如钢材、天然橡胶、羊毛、木材、化肥等进口数量分别占国内产量的２０％至８０％，加快了我国的经济发展。据测算，每进口１亿元的物资，可以增加国内工业产值１．５亿元，出口１亿美元的工业品，可以增加国内产值５．８亿元，仅１９８７年，通过进出口使国内增加的工业产值大约有３８００亿元之多。
