	The Jixian Radiator Factory in Hebei Province has, in recent years, established ties with 29 domestic universities and research institutions, hiring 51 experts and scholars as part-time consultants for the factory. By leveraging their expertise, the factory has overcome technical challenges and developed a series of radiators that are popular domestically and have begun to be exported.

	The Jixian Radiator Factory is a township-owned enterprise that lacks technical talent. They have turned to society for help, "using a ladder to climb higher." To improve the strength of the material used in high-rise building radiators, they invited Professor Yu Duwu, an authority in casting from Tsinghua University, to be a consultant. Professor Yu introduced five professors and lecturers to guide the factory and brought a research project from the Thermal Engineering Department, "using trace elements to treat cast iron with inoculation," to the factory for trials. Finally, they successfully developed a rare-earth gray cast iron high-pressure radiator with a pressure-bearing capacity of over 8 kilograms, leading the world. Zhao Xianzhi, the director of the Heating Design Room at the Northeast Branch of the Chinese Architecture Design Institute in Shenyang, worked with the factory's technical staff to develop radiators from a single type to a series, meeting the needs of different buildings. Among them, the 640-type Chunfeng brand radiator won the national quality silver award.

　　冀县暖气片厂借社会智力求发展
    本报讯  河北省冀县暖气片厂近年来同国内２９所大专院校、科研机构挂钩，聘请了５１位专家、学者做工厂的兼职顾问，借用他们的智力，攻克技术难题，开发的系列暖气片畅销国内，并开始出口。
    冀县暖气片厂是一家镇办企业，缺乏技术人才。他们面向社会，“借梯子上楼”。为了提高高层建筑暖气片材质的强度，他们请来了清华大学铸造专业权威于笃武教授当顾问。于教授又介绍了５位教授、讲师到厂指导，并把热工系正在研究的“采用微量元素对铸铁进行孕育处理”的课题，拿到工厂进行试验，终于研制成功了稀土灰口铸铁高压暖气片，承压能力达到８公斤以上，居世界领先地位。沈阳中国建筑东北设计院采暖设计室主任赵先智与该厂技术人员共同努力，使暖气片由单一走向系列化，满足了不同建筑的需要。其中６４０型春风牌暖气片获得了国家质量银质奖。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（崔彦杰）
