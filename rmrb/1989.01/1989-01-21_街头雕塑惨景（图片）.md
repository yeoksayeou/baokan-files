To beautify the urban environment and develop tourism, in recent years, many large and medium-sized cities have placed numerous sculptures, meticulously crafted by artists, in central green spaces, squares, and parks. There are sculptures of figures that evoke warmth and tenderness, adorable small animals, and mythical stories that stir the imagination. These beautifully shaped artworks add charm to the cities, delighting the eyes of passersby.

Unfortunately, shortly after these artworks are installed, some are vandalized by a few individuals, leaving them defaced and damaged.

The other day, I rode my bicycle from the docks in my city to Nan Shi Dao Street to run some errands. Along the way, I saw the pitiful state of the street sculptures and took a series of photographs. If a few of these can be published as a warning, it might arouse people's concern and love for the city's artistic sculptures, and draw the attention of relevant departments to the management of city sculptures.

Image 1: The "Hope" sculpture next to the east side of the Children's Hospital has had the mother's head recently reattached, but the child's arms are missing again.

Image 2: At the intersection of Dongbei Road and Zhongshan Road, in the central garden, the Crouching Tiger's magical ring and right arm are missing, but people still climb up to take photos.

Image 3: The small deer in the green space on Nan Shi Dao Street, which has lost its horns, is searching for its lost companion.

Image 4: The twelve zodiac animals by the Mingze Lake in the Children's Park have been defaced beyond recognition in less than half a year.

    街头雕塑惨景
    为美化城市环境，开发旅游业，近几年来一些大中城市在街心绿地、广场、公园，设了不少经艺术家精心创作的雕塑。有情调温馨的人物，有逗人喜欢的小动物，有引人遐想的神话故事。这些造型优美的艺术作品，给城市增添了美感，使人们赏心悦目。
    可惜，这些艺术作品设放不久，有的便被少数人涂抹攀折，弄得污秽、残破不堪了。
    日前，我从我市码头骑车到南石道街去办事，途中，见街旁雕塑惨景，特地拍下一组照片。如能选登几幅作为鉴戒，以期唤起人们关心、爱护城市艺术雕塑之心，引起有关部门重视对城市雕塑的管理。
    图一：市儿童医院大门东侧的“希望”雕塑，妈妈的头刚刚粘上不久，孩子的双臂又不知去向。
    图二：东北路与中山路交汇处的街心花园里，哪咤的乾坤圈与右臂不知落向何方，但还有人爬到上边留影。
    图三：立在南石道街绿地上失去双角的小鹿正在寻找失去的同伴。
    图四：儿童公园明泽湖畔的十二生肖，不到半年就被涂抹得不成样子。
