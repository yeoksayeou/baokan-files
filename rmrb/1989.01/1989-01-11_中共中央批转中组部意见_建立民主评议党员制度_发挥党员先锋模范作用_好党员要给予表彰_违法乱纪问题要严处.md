The Central Committee of the CCP recently approved the opinion of the Central Organization Department on establishing a democratic evaluation system for party members, requiring that the evaluation of party members and cadres should include upholding the overall situation, maintaining integrity, and strictly adhering to laws and regulations.

The notice from the Central Committee of the CCP points out that establishing a democratic evaluation system for party members is an important measure to strictly govern the party and improve the quality of party members. It is an effective method to strengthen the regular education, management, and supervision of party members through institutional construction. This is of great significance in giving full play to the leading role of the party and the vanguard and exemplary role of party members in rectifying the economic environment, rectifying the economic order, and deepening the overall reform.

The notice from the Central Committee of the CCP requires that the democratic evaluation system for party members should be gradually implemented on the basis of pilot projects. For grassroots party organizations with incomplete leadership teams, the leadership teams should be rectified and adjusted first. Various levels of party committees should strengthen leadership, coordinate the efforts of the organization, propaganda, and disciplinary inspection departments, and work together to do a good job in this regard.

The Central Organization Department's opinion on establishing a democratic evaluation system for party members

The 13th National Congress of the CCP proposed the task of strictly governing the party and required that the construction of the party should take a new path of not launching political campaigns but relying on reform and institutional construction. The Third Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee emphasized that at this critical moment of rectifying the economic environment, rectifying the economic order, and deepening the overall reform, it is particularly important to give full play to the leading role of the party and the vanguard and exemplary role of party members. To implement the above tasks and requirements, many local party organizations have, while strengthening democratic supervision over party members and leading cadres, carried out activities to democratically evaluate party members, integrating the education, management, and supervision of party members into one, which has achieved good results in improving the quality of party members and giving full play to their role. We suggest that, on the basis of pilot projects, a democratic evaluation system for party members should be gradually established and implemented in grassroots party organizations in cities and towns across the country. The specific opinions are as follows:

One, the purpose of the evaluation

Through the education of all party members to be qualified communists in the new era, through democratic evaluation and organizational examination, the situation of each party member in practicing the party's basic line, especially in rectifying the economic environment, rectifying the economic order, and deepening the overall reform, in giving full play to the vanguard and exemplary role, should be checked and evaluated. Excellent party members should be commended, and the work of eliminating corrupt elements and dealing with unqualified party members should be promoted to improve the quality of party members and enhance the cohesion and combat effectiveness of the party organization.

Two, the content of the evaluation

In the new historical period, a communist should be loyal to the cause of communism, firmly implement the party's basic line in the primary stage of socialism, and strive for the construction of socialism with Chinese characteristics. According to this general requirement, the evaluation of party members should focus on the following five aspects:

1. Whether they have a firm communist faith, whether they can adhere to the four cardinal principles, adhere to reform and opening up, combine the realization of the common ideal in this stage with doing a good job in their own work down-to-earth, and wholeheartedly serve the people.

2. Whether they resolutely implement the party's basic line and various policies and guidelines in the primary stage of socialism, maintain political unity with the Central Committee, and contribute to the development of productive forces and the construction of socialist spiritual civilization.

3. Whether they stand at the forefront of reform, maintain the overall situation of reform, correctly handle the relationship between the interests of the state, the collective, and the individual, and ensure that personal interests are subordinate to the interests of the party and the people, and local interests are subordinate to the overall interests.

4. Whether they strictly implement the party's resolutions, adhere to party discipline, administrative discipline, and state laws, and resolutely ensure that orders are carried out.

5. Whether they maintain close ties with the masses, care about the people's hardships, work hard, maintain integrity, and sacrifice personal interests for the interests of the party and the people when there is a conflict between personal interests and the interests of the party and the people.

Various localities and departments should determine the specific content of the evaluation of party members in combination with the actual situation. Party and government agencies and large and medium-sized enterprises should evaluate party member cadres, and should include upholding the overall situation, maintaining integrity, and strictly adhering to laws and regulations as important content.

Three, the basic methods

The work of democratically evaluating party members should be carried out step by step under the leadership of the party committee, with the branch as the unit. The methods should be simple and easy to operate, and the time should be relatively concentrated, and should not be too long.

1. Learning and education. Conduct universal education for party members on adhering to the party member standards in the new situation. This education should be combined with the education on the situation. The learning content should mainly include the "Constitution of the Communist Party of China," "Several Provisions on Party Political Life," the relevant chapters of the report of the 13th National Congress of the CCP, and the documents of the Third Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee. The learning methods can be varied, and the emphasis should be on effectiveness.

2. Self-evaluation. On the basis of learning and discussion, evaluate oneself against the party member standards, summarize the situation in one's thoughts, work, and study, especially check one's understanding, attitude, and actions towards deepening reform, maintaining integrity, and strengthening discipline, affirm achievements, find gaps, and clarify the direction of efforts.

3. Democratic evaluation. Generally, a party small group meeting or a party branch meeting should be held to carry out democratic evaluation. In the evaluation, the right and wrong should be clear, dare to touch on contradictions, and carry out criticism and self-criticism seriously and not superficially. Appropriate methods should also be adopted to listen to the opinions of non-party masses.

4. Organizational examination. The branch committee should conduct a realistic and comprehensive analysis of the opinions of party members and non-party members, form an organizational opinion, inform the person concerned, and report to the branch congress.

5. Commendation and handling. Party organizations should commend good party members through oral or written forms. For party members with outstanding exemplary roles, they can be discussed and passed by the branch congress, reported to the higher-level party committee for approval, and awarded the title of outstanding communist. For the problems of violating laws and regulations exposed in the evaluation, they should be seriously investigated and dealt with. For party members who are deemed unqualified through the evaluation, the branch committee should propose appropriate handling opinions according to different situations and submit them to the branch congress for voting according to the principle of democratic centralism. Party members should be handled with great caution, principles should be adhered to, and methods should be appropriate. For those who are persuaded to withdraw or expelled, the party organization should do a good job in ideological work. After they leave the party, they should continue to care for and unite with them, and continue to play their role in work.

Four, strengthening leadership

Democratic evaluation of party members is an important measure to educate and strengthen the supervision of party members, and is also an effective way to support and carry forward the positive factors within the party, overcome negative factors, eliminate corrupt elements, and properly handle unqualified party members. Various levels of party committees should seriously discuss and study, make specific arrangements, strengthen investigation and research, conduct supervision and inspection, provide timely guidance, and prevent formalism. Grassroots party organizations should understand the situation of party members in advance, be prepared, and avoid rushing into action. In the future, democratic evaluation of party members will be conducted once a year to form a system.

　　中共中央批转中组部意见  
    建立民主评议党员制度　发挥党员先锋模范作用
    好党员要给予表彰　违法乱纪问题要严处
    新华社北京１月１０日电  中共中央最近批转了中央组织部《关于建立民主评议党员制度的意见》，要求评议党员干部要把顾全大局、清正廉洁、严守法纪作为重要内容。
    中共中央的通知指出，建立民主评议党员制度，是从严治党，提高党员素质的一项重要措施，是通过制度建设加强对党员进行经常性教育、管理和监督的有效方法，对于在治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序、全面深化改革中充分发挥党的领导核心作用和党员的先锋模范作用，具有重要的意义。
    中共中央的通知要求，民主评议党员制度要在试点的基础上逐步推行。基层党组织领导班子不健全的，首先要把领导班子整顿调整好。各级党委要加强领导，协调组织、宣传、纪检等部门的力量，共同把这项工作搞好。
    新华社北京１月１０日电　中央组织部《关于建立民主评议党员制度的意见》
    党的十三大提出了从严治党的任务，并要求党的建设走出一条不搞政治运动，而靠改革和制度建设的新路子。十三届三中全会强调在治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序、全面深化改革的关键时刻，尤其要发挥党的领导核心作用和党员的先锋模范作用。为了贯彻落实上述任务和要求，目前许多地方的党组织，在加强对党员领导干部实行民主监督的同时，开展了民主评议党员的活动，把教育、管理和监督党员融为一体，对于提高党员素质、发挥党员作用收到了很好的效果。我们建议，在试点的基础上，在全国城乡基层党组织中逐步建立和实行民主评议党员的制度。具体意见如下：
    一、评议目的
    通过对全体党员进行做新时期合格共产党员的教育，通过民主评议和组织考察，检查和评价每个党员在坚持党的基本路线的实践中，特别是在当前治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序、全面深化改革中发挥先锋模范作用的情况，表彰优秀党员，推动清除腐败分子和处置不合格党员的工作，提高党员素质，增强党组织的凝聚力和战斗力。
    二、评议内容
    在新的历史时期，共产党员应当忠诚于共产主义事业，坚定不移地执行党在社会主义初级阶段的基本路线，为建设有中国特色的社会主义而努力奋斗。按照这个总的要求，着重从以下五个方面对党员进行评议：
    １、是否具有坚定的共产主义信念，能否坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放，把实现现阶段的共同理想同脚踏实地地做好本职工作结合起来，全心全意为人民服务。
    ２、是否坚决贯彻执行党在社会主义初级阶段的基本路线和各项方针、政策，在政治上同党中央保持一致，为推动生产力的发展和社会主义精神文明建设作出贡献。
    ３、是否站在改革的前列，维护改革的大局，正确处理国家、集体、个人利益之间的关系，做到个人利益服从党和人民的利益，局部利益服从整体利益。
    ４、是否切实地执行党的决议，严守党纪、政纪、国法，坚决做到令行禁止。
    ５、是否密切联系群众，关心群众疾苦，艰苦奋斗，廉洁奉公，在个人利益同党和人民的利益发生矛盾时，自觉地牺牲个人利益。
    各地、各部门要结合实际情况，确定评议党员的具体内容。党政机关和大中型企业评议党员干部，要把顾全大局、清正廉洁、严守法纪作为重要内容。
    三、基本方法
    民主评议党员工作，要在党委的领导下，以支部为单位有步骤地进行。方法要简便易行，时间要相对集中，不要拖得过长。
    １、学习教育。对党员普遍进行在新形势下坚持党员标准的教育。这项教育要同形势教育结合起来。学习内容以《中国共产党章程》、《关于党内政治生活的若干准则》、党的十三大报告的有关章节和十三届三中全会文件为主。学习方法可以多种多样，要讲求实效。
    ２、自我评价。在学习讨论的基础上，对照党员标准，总结个人在思想、工作、学习等方面的情况，特别要检查对深化改革、保持廉洁、加强纪律的认识、态度和行动，肯定成绩，找出差距，明确努力方向。
    ３、民主评议。一般应召开党小组会或党支部会，进行民主评议。评议中，要是非分明，敢于触及矛盾，认真地而不是敷衍地开展批评和自我批评。还要采取适当的方式，听取非党群众的意见。
    ４、组织考察。支委会对党内外评议的意见，进行实事求是的分析、综合，形成组织意见，转告本人，并向支部大会报告。
    ５、表彰和处理。对民主评议的好党员，由党组织通过口头或书面形式进行表扬。对模范作用突出的党员，可经过支部大会讨论通过，报上级党委批准，授予优秀共产党员的称号。对评议中揭露的违法乱纪等问题，要认真查明，严肃处理。经评议认为是不合格的党员，支委会应区别不同情况，提出妥善处置的意见，提交支部大会，按照民主集中制的原则进行表决。对党员进行组织处理，应当十分慎重，原则要坚持，方法要得当。对被劝退和除名的，党组织要做好思想工作。在他们出党以后，仍要继续关心和团结他们，在工作中继续发挥他们的作用。
    四、加强领导
    民主评议党员是对党员进行教育和加强监督的重要措施，也是扶持和发扬党内的积极因素，克服消极因素，清除腐败分子和妥善处置不合格党员的一种有效办法。各级党委要认真讨论研究，作出具体部署，加强调查研究，进行督促检查，及时指导，防止形式主义。基层党组织要事先了解党员的情况，做到心中有数，并做好必要的准备工作，避免仓促从事。今后，民主评议党员每年进行一次，形成制度。
