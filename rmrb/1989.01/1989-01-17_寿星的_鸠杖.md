The elder in "Shou Xing Tu" (Longevity Star Picture) has a prominent forehead and white beard, leaning on a staff with a bird-shaped head, known as the "Qu Zhan" (Dove Staff). What is the significance of this "Qu Zhan"?

Originally, this was an important custom in ancient China for respecting the elderly. During the Han Dynasty, the "Wang Zhan Zhi Ming" (Royal Staff Decree) was issued, stipulating that anyone over the age of seventy would be granted a "Wang Zhan" (Royal Staff) by the court, which is a staff with a dove-shaped head. Those who possessed this "Wang Zhan" enjoyed special treatment and care in society. For example, they could enter and exit official buildings without being restricted by etiquette, engage in small-scale business without paying taxes, and anyone who insulted an elder with a royal staff would be punished as if they had insulted the emperor. Their social status was equivalent to that of an official with an annual salary of six hundred dan of grain.

According to the "Li Yi Zhi" (Record of Rites and Ceremonies) in the "Hou Han Shu" (Book of the Later Han), "In the eighth month of autumn, county and district officials would inspect households and compare the ages of the people. Those who had reached seventy would be given a royal staff, provided with congee, and those who had reached eighty or ninety would receive additional gifts. The royal staff was nine chi (approximately 2.3 meters) long, with a dove bird decoration at the end. The dove is a bird that does not choke, symbolizing that the elder would not choke. This was a wish for the elder's well-being."

There is also a historical anecdote about the Qu Zhan. In the book "Feng Su Tong" (Customs and Traditions) written by the Eastern Han scholar Ying Shao, it is recorded: "During the battle between Emperor Gaozu of Han and Xiang Yu at Jingxu (near present-day Xingyang), Emperor Gaozu fled to a thicket. At that time, a dove was chirping above him, and the pursuers did not suspect anything, allowing him to escape. After he ascended the throne, he valued this bird. Therefore, the Qu Zhan was created and given to the elderly." This further illustrates that the Qu Zhan symbolizes safety and good fortune.

In summary, whether it symbolizes not choking or good fortune, it all reflects beautiful wishes for the elderly. However, some recent market-available New Year paintings have depicted the dove-headed staff as a symbol of power, with a dragon-headed staff. This might be a result of misinterpretation and popularization.

　　寿星的“鸠杖”
    杨明扬
    “寿星图”里的寿星额隆白须，拄着一根拐杖，杖头雕刻成鸟形，这种拐杖名曰“鸠杖”。这“鸠杖”是怎么回事？原来这是我国古时尊老敬老的一项重要习俗。汉代曾发布“王杖诏书令”的法律，根据这项法律规定，凡年满七十岁以上的老人，都要由朝廷赐予“王杖”（也就是杖端刻有斑鸠形状的手杖），凡持有这种“王杖”的老人，在社会上享有优待照顾。如出入官府可以不受礼节限制，做小本生意可以不纳税，有人侮辱持王杖的老人，按蔑视皇上论罪。他们的社会地位相当于年俸六百石的官吏。据《后汉书·礼仪志》载：“仲秋之月，县道皆按案户比民，年始七十，授之以王杖，铺之糜粥，八十、九十礼有加锡，王杖长（九）尺，端以鸠鸟为饰。鸠者，不噎之鸟也，欲老人不噎”。关于鸠杖还有一个历史典故，东汉学者应劭所撰《风俗通》一书载：“汉高祖与项籍战京索间（按京在今荥阳东南二十一里，索即荥阳县城，古为大索）。遁于簿中，时有鸠鸟鸣其上，追者不疑，遂得脱。及即位，异此鸟。故作鸠杖，赐老人也。”从这里又可看出鸠杖是安全吉祥的象征。总之，象征不噎也好、吉祥也好，都体现了对老人的美好祝愿。但目前市场上出现的一些年画中，竟把鸠头杖画作象征权力的龙头拐杖，也许是讹传俗成。
