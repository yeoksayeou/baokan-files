Thai Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan said today in Bangkok that Hun Sen of the Phnom Penh regime will visit Thailand next week in a private capacity.

Chatichai made the remarks when he met with Cui Zemin, vice president of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, who is currently visiting Thailand. Chatichai said that Hun Sen's visit does not mean that Thailand recognizes the Phnom Penh regime. Thailand hopes to understand Hun Sen's position on the Cambodian issue.

　　柬金边政权洪森将访泰
    新华社曼谷１月２１日电  泰国总理差猜·春哈旺今天在这里说，柬埔寨金边政权的洪森将于下周以私人身份访问泰国。
    差猜是在他的住所会见正在这里访问的中国外交学会副会长柴泽民时说这番话的。差猜说，洪森来泰并不等于泰国承认金边政权。泰国希望了解洪森在柬埔寨问题上的立场。
