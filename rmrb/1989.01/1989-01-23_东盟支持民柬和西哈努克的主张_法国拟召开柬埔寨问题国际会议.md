He said that the second informal meeting on the Cambodian issue in Jakarta is scheduled to be held from February 19 to 21, and ASEAN foreign ministers “hope that all parties will participate in the meeting.” Siddhi said that after the second informal meeting in Jakarta, the scope of the meeting will be expanded depending on the situation, and the specific countries to be included and the form of the meeting will be subject to further consultation.

	Prince Sihanouk and French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas held talks here on the 20th. A statement issued after the talks said, “France is prepared to strengthen diplomatic activities with relevant parties.”
