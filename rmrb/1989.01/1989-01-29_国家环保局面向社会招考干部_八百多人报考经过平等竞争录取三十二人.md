The State Council, in the course of its institutional reform, designated the National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA), which has a significant need for additional personnel, as a pilot department for public recruitment of staff. Over the past few months, NEPA has adhered to the principles of openness, equality, and competition to select talented individuals. The recent recruitment process has yielded satisfactory results.

From the outset, NEPA decided to use open examinations to fill its vacancies, ensuring that the best candidates are selected and the less qualified are eliminated, thereby providing equal opportunities for all applicants. They treated all applicants equally, regardless of whether they were recommended by leaders, approved by their units, or applied secretly. This approach truly opened the door to those who are ambitious and blocked the "back door."

To increase the transparency of the recruitment process, eliminate improper influences, and facilitate social supervision, NEPA published recruitment notices in newspapers and on television nine times between early November 1988. They outlined the basic qualifications and requirements for applicants. This recruitment method was well-received by society. During the three-day registration period, over 800 people either came to the agency or sent applications by mail, which is more than 20 times the number of positions available. The quality of the applicants was high: 11.9% held master's or doctoral degrees, 82.1% were university graduates, and 6% were college graduates. Among them, 28.7% held senior or intermediate professional technical titles. In terms of age, 60% were under 30 years old, and only 15% were over 40. Most of these applicants were either looking to solve practical issues such as long commutes, or were from units where talent was surplus, workload was light, or the work environment was less than ideal. They were eager to move to an environment where they could fully utilize their professional skills and truly make a contribution.

Through qualification reviews, written exams, interviews, physical examinations, and organizational assessments, the first batch of 32 successful candidates began a one-week pre-job training session on January 23. After they start their jobs, they will undergo a one-year probationary period. It is reported that the NEPA's staffing is still not complete, and this year they plan to recruit another 50 or so people based on the experience gained from this recruitment process.

　　国家环保局面向社会招考干部     
    八百多人报考经过平等竞争录取三十二人
    本报北京１月２８日讯  记者谢联辉报道：国务院在机构改革中，把需要补充人员较多的国家环境保护局作为面向社会招考补员的试验部门。几个月来，国家环保局按照公开、平等、竞争的原则，广择人才。从最近告一段落的招考工作来看，已取得满意效果。
    国家环保局面向社会招考机关工作人员，一开始就决定采用公开考试的办法，优者胜，劣者汰，给报考者平等竞争的机会。他们对局领导收到的２００多件“信”和“条子”推荐的人员和没有推荐信、推荐条子自己来报考的，经过单位同意来报考的和“秘密”报考者，都一视同仁，给有志者敞开了大门，真正堵住“后门”。
    为了增加招考录用工作的透明度，排除不正之风干扰，有利于社会监督，在１９８８年１１月上旬，他们利用报纸、电视先后９次刊登播放招考启事，提出报考基本条件和要求。这种报考办法受到社会欢迎。在３天的报名期间，先后有８００多人来局或来函报名，是录取人数的２０多倍。报名者的素质较高，从学历看，有硕士、博士学位的占１１．９％，大学毕业的８２．１％，大专毕业的６％；其中有高中级专业技术职称的占２８．７％。从年龄看，６０％是３０岁以下的年轻人，４０岁以上的中年人只占１５％。这些报考者，有的是想借机解决上班远等实际困难，但绝大多数是所在单位人才积压、工作量不饱满或工作环境不太理想，迫切需要流动到一个能发挥专业特长的环境中，真正干一番事业。
    通过资格审查、笔试、面试、体检、组织考察，第一批被录取试用的３２名人员，于１月２３日开始，参加为期一周的岗前培训。他们上岗后，还将接受为期１年的试用考察。据悉，国家环保局机关编制还不满员，今年准备在总结这次考试补员的经验基础上，再招收５０名左右。
