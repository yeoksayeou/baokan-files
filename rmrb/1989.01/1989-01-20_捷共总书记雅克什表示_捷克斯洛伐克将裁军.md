The General Secretary of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, Husák, stated that Czechoslovakia is preparing to take measures to reduce its military forces.

According to the Czechoslovak News Agency, Husák made these remarks during a meeting with Ali Salem al-Bid, the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Party of the Democratic Republic of Yemen.

This is the second time the General Secretary has mentioned Czechoslovakia's plans to cut military spending. In an interview with West German radio and television reporters on December 3, 1988, he emphasized that Czechoslovakia not only supports the Soviet Union's decision to withdraw a tank division from Czechoslovakia but is also "looking for ways to reduce its own military strength."

　　捷共总书记雅克什表示
    捷克斯洛伐克将裁军
    新华社布拉格１月１８日电  捷共中央总书记雅克什表示，捷克斯洛伐克正准备采取裁军措施。
    据捷通社报道，雅克什是在今天同也门民主人民共和国社会党中央总书记阿里·萨利姆·比德举行会谈时讲这番话的。
    这是这位总书记第二次谈到捷克斯洛伐克将进行裁军的问题。他在１９８８年１２月３日向西德广播和电视台记者发表的谈话中强调，捷克斯洛伐克不仅支持苏联从捷撤走一个坦克师的决定，而且自己“也正寻找途径削减本国的军事力量”。
