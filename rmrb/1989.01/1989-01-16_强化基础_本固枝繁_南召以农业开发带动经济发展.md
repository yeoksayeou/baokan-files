The People's Daily reports: Nanzhao County in Henan Province, starting from its own realities, has developed agricultural resources, strengthened the agricultural foundation, and promoted steady economic development.

Nanzhao County is located in the Funiu Mountain area, with a population density and limited land, with an average of only 7 mu (approximately 1.17 acres) per person. It is a well-known poverty-stricken county in the province. How to develop Nanzhao's economy and achieve rapid poverty alleviation? Some people think that "grain is cheap, and fruit trees take time," so it's better to make money quickly through trade; others advocate that "industry is a money tree," so it's better to invest all the money in industry. The county committee and county government carefully analyzed these opinions, summarized past experiences and lessons, and realized that while developing industry and activating circulation are necessary, they should not neglect agriculture. Not only do people rely on agriculture for food and drink, but 70% of the raw materials for county-run industries and township enterprises come from agriculture. The circulation sector mainly involves the purchase of agricultural and sideline products and the sale of agricultural production and living materials. Without this agricultural foundation, industry and commerce cannot develop significantly. In the past, relying on agriculture did not lead to prosperity mainly because the old framework of single-crop farming was not broken through. If resources are fully utilized and development-oriented production is actively carried out, there is great hope for prosperity.

After reaching a consensus, the county committee and county government took a series of measures to encourage farmers to engage in agricultural and forestry development. The southeastern part of the county is adjacent to the Yihe Reservoir, with about 100,000 mu of gentle slopes nearby, where more than 30,000 reservoir migrants live. In the past, the county issued relief funds every year. Starting from 1986, the county government used all the relief funds to reward land reclamation, and also allocated part of the county and township finances to implement "rewards instead of subsidies." Migrants could receive 70 yuan for every mu of land reclaimed. Over the past two years, 39,000 mu of land has been reclaimed in the reservoir area. Farmers use the newly reclaimed land to plant peanuts, sweet potatoes, apples, and grow chrysanthemums and asparagus on the ridges. Some households have become prosperous within a year. Over the past two years, the county and township have used loans, collective funds, and interest subsidies to invest 15 million yuan in agricultural development. Farmers use this fund and labor to plant 110,000 mu of economic forests, establish more than 100 forest farms, manage 300,000 square kilometers of small watersheds, transform 30,000 mu of sloping farmland, and expand the irrigation area by 26,400 mu.

Agricultural resource development has driven the overall economic development of the county, and farmers have benefited. According to statistics, more than 8,000 households in the county have become prosperous through forestry and agriculture. Due to the solid agricultural foundation and guaranteed industrial raw materials, the economic benefits of county-run industries and township enterprises last year increased by 127% and 52.3% respectively compared to the previous year.

　　强化基础　本固枝繁
    南召以农业开发带动经济发展
    本报讯  河南省南召县从本县实际出发，开发农业资源，强化农业基础，促进经济稳步发展。
    南召县位于伏牛山区，人多地少，全县人均只有７分多地，是全省出名的贫困县。如何发展南召经济，尽快脱贫致富？有人认为“粮食贱，林果慢”，不如跑买卖富得快；也有人主张：工业是“摇钱树”，不如把钱都花到工业上。县委、县政府认真分析这些议论，总结以往的经验教训，认识到：发展工业，搞活流通都是必要的，但决不能因此而忽视农业。不仅人们吃喝靠农业，县办工业和乡镇企业的原料７０％来自农业，流通领域也主要是收购农副产品和销售农用生产、生活物资，离开农业这个基础，工、商都难以大发展。过去靠农没富，主要因为没突破单一种田的老框框，如果充分利用资源，积极搞开发性生产，致富是大有希望的。
    认识统一后，县委、县政府采取一系列措施鼓励农民从事农、林业的开发生产。这个县东南部临近鸭河水库，附近有１０万亩平缓岗坡，居住着３万多库区移民。过去，县里年年平均发放救济款。从１９８６年起，县政府把这批救济款全部用作奖励造地，同时从县、乡财政中挤出一部分资金，实行“以奖代补”，移民每造一亩地，可以得到７０元奖励。两年多来，库区造地达３．９万亩。农民利用新造耕地，种花生、红薯，栽苹果，田埂种黄花菜、龙须草，有的户一年脱贫。两年多来，县、乡利用贷款、集资、贴息等多种办法投入农业开发资金达１５００多万元。农民利用这批资金和劳动投入，新栽经济林１１万亩，兴办林场１００多个，治理小流域３００多平方公里，改造坡耕地３万多亩，扩大灌溉面积２．６４万亩。
    农业资源开发，带动了全县经济发展，农民得到了实惠。据统计，全县靠林果业、农业脱贫致富的农户已达８０００多户。由于农业基础稳固，工业原料有保证，去年县办工业和乡镇企业的经济收益分别比上年增长１２７％和５２．３％。
