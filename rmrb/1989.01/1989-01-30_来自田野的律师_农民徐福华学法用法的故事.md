	The Lawyer from the Countryside
	– The Story of Farmer Xu Fu Hua Learning and Applying the Law
	Chen Wenxiang

	Initially, even he himself did not believe that, after four years, a genuine farmer like him would become a certified lawyer.

	In four years, he provided legal consultations for more than 270 farmers from various places, wrote over 80 legal documents for free, handled 63 civil and economic cases, and recovered nearly 200,000 yuan in economic losses. To date, the cases he has handled and concluded have a 100% win rate. This is not something that even a certified lawyer can easily achieve, let alone an amateur "mud-legged" farmer. He is the 38-year-old farmer Xu Fu Hua from Qingfeng Township, Jianhu County, Jiangsu Province, who is praised as the "good farmer lawyer."

	Due to his impoverished family background, Xu Fu Hua only attended school for six years before being forced to drop out. At that time, escaping poverty became his sole pursuit and struggle.

	An accidental event changed Xu Fu Hua's original intention.

	It was autumn 1983. Due to the supply department mixing in fake seeds, more than 70 mu of hybrid rice in Nanxu Village were severely mixed, causing a loss of over 40,000 yuan. Unfortunately, the villagers did not know how to use the law to protect their interests and instead gathered in groups to "cause trouble." As a result, they lost both the money and the case. Later, the village's 120,000 yuan in seed sales revenue was also lost because of incomplete contract terms, and the money could not be recovered.

	"I want to learn the law!" The living facts pushed Xu Fu Hua onto the path of learning the law.

	From then on, he worked in the fields during the day, always carrying two books in his pocket. When tired, he would sit on the dikes, read while resting. At night, he studied by lamplight until dawn. A relative gave him an old television, and the family was very happy, but after a few days, he found it affected his studies, so he sold it. When he encountered difficulties in his books, he would ride his bicycle for dozens of miles to seek help. In less than two years, Xu Fu Hua, using his spare time, read hundreds of thousands of words of legal books and, under the guidance of the National Lawyers Correspondence Center of the Ministry of Justice, completed 12 legal professional courses including the "Constitution," "Criminal Law," "Marriage Law," and "Criminal Procedure Law." He graduated with an average score of 87 in each subject.

	April 28, 1984, was a day Xu Fu Hua would never forget. Early in the morning, he came to the gate of the Huaiyin County People's Court in Jiangsu Province. He would use his legal weapons to appear in court for the first time.

	The court began. Xu Fu Hua immediately spoke passionately: "Last November 6, Dingji Township Farm Village in your county purchased 3,000 kilograms of hybrid rice seeds from our village based on a notarized contract. However, your county's seed department, in order to sell their own accumulated seeds, falsely claimed on the radio that our village's seeds were mixed, leading to deceived customers returning the seeds. Our village had sent people to sue in your court twice, but both times were not accepted. Now the planting season has passed. Today, I once again request your court to fairly try this case and protect our village's legal rights."

	Unexpectedly, the judge said, "You have no right to represent your village." Xu Fu Hua pointed to the proxy letter on the table and opened the "Civil Procedure Law," explaining that he had the right to act as a proxy. The judge did not expect that this "country bumpkin" was so formidable and countered, "Why did you sue after the money was overdue for more than five months?" Xu Fu Hua immediately pointed out that the lawsuit had been filed before the payment deadline and indicated that the current lawsuit did not affect the "statute of limitations"...

	Three days later, a telegram stating "all seeds have been properly handled, and the payment will be made on time" was sent to Xu Fu Hua. His eyes welled up.

	In April 1987, two people from a neighboring village came to Xu Fu Hua's home, asking him to do a good deed. It turned out that these two families had barely saved up some money and bought a three-ton cement boat from an individual shipbuilder, Zhou, in Xinghua County, Jiangsu Province. Because the boat had no steel bars, it broke into two pieces after being used for more than a month at home. This was a case of cheating the people. The next day, Xu Fu Hua rushed to Xinghua, found Zhou, and filed a lawsuit with the relevant authorities. Faced with solid facts and the authority of the law, Zhou was frightened and, after much effort, Xu Fu Hua successfully recovered the boat payment.

	Last year, a batch of goods money from the comprehensive factory in the same township was delayed by the Calcium Plastic General Factory in Huainan City, Anhui Province. The comprehensive factory sent people to demand the money three times, but all returned empty-handed. This matter reached Xu Fu Hua's ears, and he decided to be the "one who unties the knot." He went to the Intermediate People's Court in Huainan City and applied for enforcement. The factory used various tactics to delay and obstruct. Xu Fu Hua, based on the relevant provisions of the "Civil Procedure Law," with the full support of the Huainan City Court, seized a five-ton truck valued at 100,000 yuan from the factory, along with a pile of steel plates worth more than 2,000 yuan in bank interest, and brought them back smoothly. The factory wanted to give him a reward, but Xu Fu Hua refused to accept it, only taking 50 yuan for his lost wages. Many people in the factory did not understand, but he replied, "I am not suing for you for the money. My true purpose is to protect the collective and the people's legal rights to the best of my ability..."

	Now, Xu Fu Hua has officially become a lawyer at the Qingfeng Legal Affairs Office and serves as the permanent legal advisor for nine units.

    ——农民徐福华学法用法的故事
    陈文祥
    当初，连他自己都不相信，４年以后，他一个地地道道的庄稼汉，会成为正式律师。
    ４年间，他先后为各地农民提供法律咨询２７０多人次，免费代写各种法律文书８０余件，代理民事、经济案件６３起，挽回经济损失近２０万元。迄今，他代理审结的案子，胜诉率为１００％。这是正牌的律师也不那么容易做到的，更何况一个“泥腿子”的业余工作。他就是被人们誉为“农家好律师”的江苏省建湖县庆丰乡３８岁的农民徐福华。
    因家境贫寒，徐福华只喝了六年“墨水”，就被迫辍学了。那时，摆脱贫穷，成了他唯一的追求和奋斗目标。
    一个偶然的事件，改变了徐福华的初衷。
    那是１９８３年秋天，由于供种部门掺假掺杂，使南徐村７０多亩杂交稻严重混杂，损失４万多元。可惜，村民们不会用法律来保护自己的利益，而是成群结队“闹事”。结果，赔了夫人又折兵。接着，村里１２万元的种子销售款，又因合同条款不完善，被人家钻了空子，钱一直无法要回。
    “我要学法！”活生生的事实，把徐福华逼上了学法之路。
    从此，他白天下地干活，口袋里总不忘揣两本书，累了坐在田埂上，边看书边休息。晚上，挑灯夜读，常到拂晓。亲戚送他一台旧电视机，一家人很欢喜，可没几天，他发现影响学习，牙一咬就卖了。碰到书中有“拦路虎”，他能骑车去几十里外求教。两年不到，徐福华用业余时间，阅读了数百万字的法律书籍，并在司法部中华全国律师函授中心的指导下，学完了《宪法》、《刑法》、《婚姻法》、《刑事诉讼法》等１２门法律专业课程。毕业考试每门平均８７分。
    １９８４年４月２８日，徐福华终生难忘的日子。一大早，他就来到江苏省淮阴县人民法院门口，他将用自己掌握的法律武器，第一次走上庄严的法庭打官司。
    开庭了。徐福华当即慷慨陈辞：“贵县丁集乡农庄村去年１１月６日凭公证合同，购了我村３０００公斤杂交稻种，然而贵县的种子部门因自家种子积压，为了脱手，便用广播谎称我村种子有杂，导致受骗群众纷纷退种。我村曾两次派人起诉到贵庭，均未受理。眼看落谷期已过。今天，我再次请求贵庭秉公审理此案，保护我村合法权益。”
    不料，庭长说：“你无权代表你村”。徐福华指着桌上的代理委托书，并翻开《民事诉讼法》，说明自己有权代理。这位庭长没料到眼前这个“乡巴佬”这么厉害，又将一军：“为啥款子过期五个多月才起诉。”徐福华当下指出早在交款期前就已起诉的事实，并指明，现在起诉不影响“时效”……
    三天后，一份“种子全部妥善处理，货款如期还清”的加急电报，送到了徐福华手中。他眼眶“腾”地红了。
    １９８７年４月，邻村两个人来到徐福华家，央求他做做好事。原来，这两家好不容易聚了一笔钱，从江苏兴化县个体造船户周某处，买了一条三吨水泥船。由于船没钢筋，回家只用了一个多月，就断成两截。这是一起坑害群众利益的事件。第二天，徐福华风尘仆仆赶到兴化，找到周某。对方傲慢地说：“船嘛，是断过几条，可姓周的从来没赔过一分钱。不服气，告去！”徐福华当下起诉到有关部门。在确凿的事实和威严的法律面前，周某害怕了，一番辛苦之后，徐福华如数取回了船款。
    去年，本乡综合厂有一批货款被安徽省淮北市钙塑总厂久拖不还。综合厂三番五次去人索要，都是空手而归。这事，传到了徐福华的耳朵里，便决定当个“解铃人”。他来到淮北市中级人民法院，申请执行。该厂软磨硬缠，百般刁难。徐福华根据《民事诉讼法》中有关条款，在淮北市法院的全力支持下，将该厂一辆五吨卡车作价一万元，连同抵算２０００余元银行利息的一堆钢板，顺顺当当拖了回来。综合厂要给他酬金，徐福华说啥也不要，只收了５０多元的误工费。该厂有很多人不理解，他回答说：“我为你们打官司，不是图钱的，尽力保护集体和人民的合法权益，才是我真正的目的……”
    如今，徐福华已正式成了庆丰法律事务所的律师工作者，并担任了九家单位的常年法律顾问。
