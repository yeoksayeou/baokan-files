Young women often pay special attention to their eyes when they dress up. People often express their determination by saying, "Protect your eyes as you would protect your own eyes." There is also an elegant saying: "Eyes are the windows to the soul."

Unfortunately, this "window" is easily damaged and prone to disease. Eye diseases are very painful, and blindness is even more so. In China, out of several million disabled people, a significant portion are blind due to eye diseases. Beijing's hospitals have invested a lot of effort in treating eye diseases and have achieved good results. However, some eye diseases remain incurable. One such disease is "primary retinal pigment degeneration," which is very difficult to treat. If left untreated, this disease can lead to other eye conditions. Currently, when Beijing hospitals encounter this disease, doctors can only say, "I'm sorry, we can't treat it yet."

Eye disease patients are desperate. They have their families support them as they seek medical help everywhere. "Shared suffering brings people together," patients share information, saying that there is an eye disease research and treatment center in Nankou Town, north of Beijing, that can treat this disease.

This eye disease research and treatment center was established in 1986 and is composed of military doctors from the 88660 Unit. It is a small grassroots medical unit. However, the military doctors here believe that all diseases of the human body can eventually be found to have treatment methods, and small hospitals should also dare to tackle difficult diseases. They silently and diligently conduct research and never boast about their work. But it's no use keeping quiet. Patients have obtained information and have already flocked to the door of this small research and treatment center. At first, for severely ill patients, the military doctors also felt helpless. However, people have discovered the "weakness" of the military: when the common people have troubles and plead with you, you, the military, must find a way. There is a woman named Pan Limin who suffers from this difficult-to-treat eye disease. Her right eye has a vision of 0.02, and her left eye has a vision of 0.01, both within the range of blindness. As soon as she arrived at this research and treatment center, she made up her mind not to leave, telling the military doctors, "If my eyes don't get better, it's not your fault. I just hope you will try to treat me, maybe there's hope!" The military doctors had no choice but to admit her for treatment. In Western medicine, they have already found some ways to treat eye diseases based on Professor Xu Ruijuan's microcirculation theory. They also thought of the ancient Chinese medical books' saying about "relaxing the liver and brightening the eyes." The liver and eyes are far apart in the body, but since "relaxing the liver" can "brighten the eyes," there must be a connection. They used liver-relaxing Chinese medicine to treat the disease and saw the effects. They then found a way to improve microcirculation by activating blood and resolving stasis, adjusting metabolic imbalances, and changing the body's immune status, developing a series of Chinese medicine prescriptions with better effects. Following that, the military doctors found a way to use acupuncture and drug injections, which also had good effects. By combining Western and Chinese medicine, after two months of treatment, Pan Limin saw the light again, and the "blind" person was no longer blind! Pan Limin was discharged from the hospital and returned home, her vision gradually recovered, and she could take care of herself.

The military doctors carefully summarized and verified the results from this case, discovering that using only Western medicine methods made it difficult to consolidate the treatment effects; using only Chinese medicine methods also made it difficult to consolidate; only by combining the two methods could they find the best way to treat eye diseases. From 1986 to 1988, the research and treatment center of this unit treated a total of 1077 eye disease patients from various places—not just "primary retinal pigment degeneration," but also "chronic central serous retinopathy," "viral keratitis," "retinal artery and vein occlusion," "true and false myopia in adolescents," and "amblyopia in children." The total effective rate for all these diseases was over 80%, and some reached 100%.

The news spread in the medical community. Some eye diseases that were previously considered "incurable" were actually cured in this small research and treatment center under the Great Wall. Eye specialists from Beijing and Shanghai, such as Zhang Xiaolou, Li Fengming, Yang Dewang, Chen Dengtang, and Song Chen, all enthusiastically helped this research and treatment center with its work. When talking about the history of treating eye diseases over the past three years, the director of this research and treatment center, Colonel Niu Kuaiwen, did not mention the hard work of the military doctors at all, but always sincerely thanked the experts who had guided them.

The news also spread abroad. Mr. Abe Tsuruichi from Japan had severe eye disease and underwent surgery in his home country, but the effect was not ideal, and he could not take care of himself. He came to China and found this research and treatment center, receiving combined treatment of Western and Chinese medicine. After two months, his visual field expanded by 10 degrees, and he could take care of himself. Mr. Abe Tsuruichi held a banner with the words "Sincere Friendship and Excellent Medical Skills" and bowed deeply to the military doctors, moved to tears. A female university student from the Mongolian People's Republic, Lv Luona, suffered from "retinal vasculitis," and her right eye was gradually losing sight. She came to this research and treatment center for two months and also saw the light. Following that, Americans and Malaysians also came to treat their eyes, all with good results. The research and treatment center followed up on the more than a thousand discharged patients, and most patients wrote back saying that the effects were consolidated, and some were still improving.

The eye disease research and treatment center of the 88660 Unit, with only 65 medical staff, has poor conditions and limited funds. However, everyone is united and dedicated, determined to continue research and treatment, and bring light to more blind people.

　　为失明者争来光明
    ——记人民解放军８８６６０部队眼底病研治所
    本报记者  马鹤青
    姑娘们梳妆打扮，常在眼睛上下功夫。人们表示决心，总说“要像爱护自己的眼睛一样爱护什么什么”。还有句文雅的话：“眼睛是心灵的窗户”。
    可惜，这个“窗户”很容易损坏，很容易生病。眼睛有病很痛苦，病到双目失明更痛苦。我国的几百万残疾人，有很大一部分是眼病致残的。北京各医院在医治眼病方面花了很大力气，取得较好的效果，可是对有些眼病至今没法治好。一种称作“原发性视网膜色素变性”的眼病就很难医治。治不好，这种病还会引发出别的眼病。现在，北京各医院遇到这种眼病，医生只好说：“很抱歉，我们还治不了。”
    眼病患者心急如火。他们让家人扶着到处奔走求医。“同病相怜”，病人们互相传告，说北京以北的南口镇有家眼底病研治所，能治这种眼病。
    这个眼病研治所１９８６年才成立，由８８６６０部队的军医们组成。这是一个很小的基层医疗单位。可是，这里的军医们相信人身上的病迟早总能找到治疗办法，小医院也应当敢碰疑难病症。他们默默无闻地潜心研究，总也不对外张扬。不张扬也没用。病人们得到信息，已纷纷来到这个小研治所的门口。开头，对病重的，军医们也感到为难。可是，人们摸透了解放军的“弱点”：老百姓有疾苦，又苦苦求你，你解放军就得想办法。有位名叫潘丽明的女工，得的就是那种难治的眼病，右眼０．０２，左眼０．０１，已属盲人范围。她一来到这个研治所，就下定决心不走，对军医们说：“我这眼，治不好不怪你们，只求你们试着治一治，兴许有希望！”军医们只好把她收下治疗。在西医方面，他们已经根据修瑞娟教授的微循环原理，摸索到一些治眼病的办法。他们又想到我国古典医书上关于“舒肝明目”的说法。人的肝脏同眼睛相去很远，既然“舒肝”就能“明目”，二者必有关联，就用舒肝的中药治病，见到疗效。他们又找到活血化瘀改善微循环来调整代谢失调、改变机体免疫状态的办法，研究出中药系列处方，疗效更好。接着，军医们找到用针刺穴位、药物注射的办法，疗效也很好。西医办法和中医办法结合运用，治疗两个月，潘丽明眼前见到光明，“瞎子”不瞎了！潘丽明出院回家，视力逐渐恢复，生活全能自理。
    军医们从这个病例中细细总结论证，发现单纯用西医办法，很难巩固治疗效果；单纯用中医办法，也难巩固；必须把两种办法结合起来，才是探索治好眼病的最好途径。从１９８６年到１９８８年，这个部队的研治所总共收治各地的眼病患者１０７７人——不光是“原发性视网膜色素变性”，还有“陈旧性中心性视网膜炎”、“病毒性角膜炎”、“视网膜动静脉阻塞”、“青少年真假近视”、“儿童弱视”等眼病，总有效率都在８０％以上，有的达到１００％。
    消息在医学界传开。原先人们认为是“不治之症”的一些眼病，竟在万里长城下边这个小小的研治所里治好了。北京、上海的眼科专家张晓楼、李凤鸣、杨德旺、陈登堂、宋琛等，都热心地帮助这个研治所开展工作。谈起近三年医治眼病的历史，这个研治所的主任钮魁文上校一字没谈军医们下的苦功，总是热诚感谢指导过他们的专家。
    消息也传到国外。日本的阿部鹤一先生眼病严重，在本国作了手术，效果不够理想，生活不能自理。他来中国，找到这个研治所，接受中西医结合治疗。两个月下来，视野扩大１０度，生活能自理了。阿部鹤一先生手举一面绣着“真挚的友谊　高超的医术”的锦旗，向军医们深深鞠躬，感动得满面热泪。蒙古人民共和国的女大学生嫒陆娜患“视网膜血管炎”，右眼已渐渐失明。她来到这个研治所两个月，也见到了光明。接着，又有美国人、马来西亚人慕名赶来治眼，都取得较好的效果。研治所对出院的上千名病人随访调查，病人大都来信说疗效巩固，有的正继续好转。
    ８８６６０部队这个只有６５位医护人员的眼底病研治所条件较差，经费有限，可大家齐心热心，决心继续研治，给更多失明者带来光明。
