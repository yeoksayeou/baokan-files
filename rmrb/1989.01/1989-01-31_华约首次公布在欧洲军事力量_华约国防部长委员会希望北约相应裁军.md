The Warsaw Pact defense ministers' council issued a statement on January 29, revealing for the first time the number of troops and weapons of the Soviet Union and other Warsaw Pact countries stationed in Europe. It also estimated the number of troops and weapons of NATO countries, including the United States, stationed in Europe.

The statement, titled "Comparison of the Number of Armed Forces and Weapons of the Warsaw Pact and NATO in Europe and Adjacent Waters," was published in today's edition of the Soviet newspaper Pravda. The statement revealed that the Warsaw Pact has a total of 3,573,000 troops in Europe, including 1,823,000 in the army, 425,000 in the air force, and 338,000 in the navy. NATO has a total of 3,660,000 troops in Europe, including 2,115,000 in the army, 482,000 in the air force, and 685,000 in the navy. The weaponry situation in Europe for the two military blocs is as follows: Warsaw Pact—7,876 combat aircraft, 1,608 tactical missile launchers, 574,700 tanks, 703,300 armored vehicles and armored cars, 228 submarines (excluding those carrying strategic intercontinental missiles), and 102 large surface vessels; NATO—7,130 combat aircraft, 136 tactical missile launchers, 30,690 tanks, 46,900 armored vehicles and armored cars, 200 submarines, and 499 large surface vessels.

The statement expressed that whether it is the Warsaw Pact or NATO, their armed forces should be maintained at a level that can only reliably defend themselves and do not have the capability to attack the other side.

The statement hopes that NATO countries will follow the example of the Warsaw Pact countries and also take unilateral disarmament measures.
