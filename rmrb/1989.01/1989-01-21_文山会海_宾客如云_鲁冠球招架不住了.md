In late November 1988, the famous farmer-entrepreneur and general manager of Hangzhou Wanxiang Joint Venture Company, Lu Guanqiu, was in an exceptionally good mood. Early that morning, he went to the workshop. Frequently visiting the workshop is a habit of Lu Guanqiu's. However, he hadn't been there for more than a week.

What chains had bound Lu Guanqiu, preventing him from going to the workshop?

Chain one: The deluge of meetings

Statistics show that Lu Guanqiu attends one or two meetings outside the company every week on average. Invitations to various meetings unrelated to Wanxiang Joint Venture Company are innumerable. Several colleagues from the company often attend meetings on his behalf; otherwise, even with three heads and six arms, he would find it hard to cope.

Additionally, Lu Guanqiu holds nearly 20 social positions, such as President of the Chinese Farmers' Entrepreneurs Association, Director of the Chinese Entrepreneurs Association, and Chairman of a certain hotel. Therefore, Lu Guanqiu has to spend a great deal of energy attending various symposiums, tea parties, and seminars.

Chain two: The throng of visitors

Incomplete statistics show that in 1987, 1,291 groups, totaling 25,721 people, came to Hangzhou Wanxiang Joint Venture Company to learn from their experience, averaging three or four groups and 70 people per day. From January to October 1988, more than 1,000 groups, totaling 14,329 people, visited the company. These visitors came from all over the country, including cadres, workers, farmers, teachers, and students from primary, secondary, and tertiary schools. Some came for inspections, some for research, some for advice, and most for tours. The unending stream of visitors often kept Lu Guanqiu trapped in the company's reception room.

Chain three: The piles of mail

Because Lu Guanqiu holds nearly 20 social positions, the documents, bulletins, and official letters from these social organizations and higher authorities pile up like a small mountain. What troubles him even more are the countless personal letters from all over the country. The content of these letters generally falls into three categories: requests for money, requests for jobs, and requests for help in selling products.

The flood of documents and meetings, along with the unending stream of visitors, hinder Lu Guanqiu from going to the workshop and conducting normal work. Lu Guanqiu is at his wits' end. Lu Guanqiu said, "I am tied up by invisible chains, burdened with too many trivial matters, and feel utterly exhausted. I hope the whole society can understand me and support me."

### 文山会海　宾客如云  鲁冠球招架不住了

　　文山会海　宾客如云    
    鲁冠球招架不住了
    １９８８年１１月下旬的一天，著名农民企业家、浙江杭州万向节厂厂长鲁冠球的心情格外舒畅，一大早，他就去车间了。经常深入车间，是鲁冠球的习惯。这一阵子，他却有一个多星期没去了。
    是什么绳索捆住鲁冠球下不了车间呢？
    绳索之一：成灾的会议
    据统计，鲁冠球平均每周外出参加会议一二次。各种与万向节厂不相干的会议请柬不计其数，厂部的几位同志经常代替鲁冠球参加一些会议，否则他纵有三头六臂，也难以招架。
    另外，鲁冠球还兼任了近２０个社会职务，如中国农民企业家联谊会会长、中国企业家协会理事、某宾馆董事长等。因此，鲁冠球不得不花费大量精力去应付各种座谈会、茶话会和研讨会。
    绳索之二：成群的来宾
    据不完全统计，１９８７年以参观取经为由来杭州万向节厂的人达１２９１批，共２５７２１人，平均每天三四批，７０多人。１９８８年１月至１０月，又有１０００多批，共１４３２９人来到杭州万向节厂。这些宾客来自全国各地，有干部、工人、农民、教师和大、中、小学生。有的来视察，有的来调研，有的来求教，更多的是来参观。川流不息的客人们经常把鲁冠球堵在厂接待室里。
    绳索之三：成堆的信函
    由于鲁冠球身兼近２０个社会职务，这些社会组织和上级部门发来的文件、简报、公函，堆成了小山。更使他头痛的是，来自全国难以数计的私人信件。信的内容大致有３种：要钱，要工作，要求帮助推销产品。
    文山会海和源源不断的来宾，阻挠了鲁冠球下车间和开展正常工作，鲁冠球苦不堪言。鲁冠球说：“我被一条条无形的绳索捆住了，杂事太多，感到精疲力尽。我希望全社会能够理解我，并且支持我。” 　　　　　　　　　　　浙江萧山广播站　胡飞　吴康
