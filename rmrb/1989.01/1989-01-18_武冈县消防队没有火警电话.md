The fire brigade in Wugang County, Hunan Province, was established in 1979, but it still does not have a 119 fire alarm hotline. Within the county seat, when people discover a fire and need to report it, they have to look up the fire brigade's phone number in the directory or ask the county's telephone switchboard to help transfer the call. In rural areas far from the county seat, it is even more difficult to get through to the fire brigade by phone. On October 28, 1988, at around 6:30 PM, a fire broke out in Huangmao Village, more than 20 kilometers away from Wugang County. It took nearly an hour just to make the phone call. By the time the fire brigade arrived, the houses of 46 households in the village had already been reduced to ashes, causing nearly 300,000 yuan in damages.

　　武冈县消防队没有火警电话
    我省武冈县消防中队建于一九七九年，但一直未能安上一一九火警电话。在县城内，人们发现火情报警，只得翻开电话号码簿寻找县消防队的电话号码，或由县电话总机“帮忙”转。在远离县城的农村，一旦发生火灾，想打通县消防队电话就更难了。一九八八年十月二十八日下午六点三十分，距武冈县二十多公里的黄茅村起火。打电话就耽误了近一个小时，待消防队赶到时，村里四十六户人家的房屋已全部化为灰烬，造成了近三十万元的损失。　　湖南长沙　胡友书
