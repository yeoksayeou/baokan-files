Recently, the staff of Suzhou's Gusu Food Machinery Factory told our reporter: In the past few years, they have manufactured over 420 sets of chocolate production equipment. The equipment has been widely used in 28 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, replacing imports and saving the country over $40 million in foreign exchange. In 1988, despite a 70% increase in raw material prices, they tapped into their potential, improved management, reduced production costs by 8%, and increased their profit margin from nearly 20% in 1987 to 23.5%. The total profit increased by 30%, reaching over 2.4 million yuan.

This small factory located in the suburbs of Suzhou, in the town of Hushuguan, has thrived mainly through the power of "uniqueness."

First, through unique products. Previously, they were engaged in mechanical repair and maintenance. Only in recent years have they started manufacturing food machinery. From the beginning, they focused on the "unique" aspect, introducing technology and talent from Shanghai to specialize in chocolate production equipment, which had previously relied on imports. From single machines to complete sets, they quickly became the only factory in the country capable of producing complete sets of chocolate production equipment, earning the title of "Mother of Chinese Chocolate." As the market became increasingly saturated, they began developing new products last year. One is the new matching equipment for chocolate production lines, the egg-shaped machine, and the other is a fully automatic ice cream production line, capable of producing various types of ice cream with different flavors and fillings.

Second, through unique services. To help users in remote areas quickly master the production technology, they used their own equipment to set up a food factory, specifically for training technical workers for users. From operation and machine repair to production formulas, they provide comprehensive training. Last year, after learning that some users were worried about the supply of raw materials, they established a supply and marketing company in July to organize the supply of raw and auxiliary materials such as cocoa powder for users in need. In just a few months, they provided over 200 tons. Additionally, they often provide free assistance to users for equipment debugging and maintenance, whether in Xinjiang or Guangdong, covering all aspects of food, accommodation, and transportation. For this, many users have exclaimed: It seems that buying equipment from Gusu Factory is the most reassuring.

### 创制独家产品　提供独到服务  姑苏食品机械总厂以“独”取胜

　　创制独家产品　提供独到服务
    姑苏食品机械总厂以“独”取胜
    本报讯  记者吴长生报道：最近，苏州姑苏食品机械总厂的同志告诉记者：几年来，他们已制造４２０多套巧克力生产设备，用户普及２８省、市、区，顶替进口累计为国家节汇４０００多万美元。１９８８年，在原材料涨价７０％多的困难条件下，他们挖掘潜力，改善管理，使生产成本降低８％，利润率却由１９８７年的近２０％提高到２３．５％，利润总额增加３０％，达到２４０多万元。
    这家位于苏州郊区浒墅关镇的小厂，主要靠“独”字兴旺发达。
    一靠独家产品。过去他们是搞机械修配的，近几年才搞起食品机械制造。从开始就做“独”字文章，他们从上海引进技术、人才，专攻过去一直依赖进口的巧克力生产设备。由单机到配套，很快他们成了国内唯一能制造巧克力生产成套设备的厂家，被誉为“中国巧克力之母”。随着市场的日趋饱和，他们从去年起又研制新产品，一是巧克力生产线的新配套设备蛋型机，一是全自动冷饮生产线，可生产各类花色、夹心雪糕。
    二靠独到的服务。为了帮助边远地区用户尽快掌握生产工艺，他们用自产设备办了一个食品分厂，专为用户培训技术工人，从操作、机修到工艺配方，全部包教。去年，了解到一些用户为生产原料发愁的情况后，他们于７月组建起供销公司，专门为困难用户组织可可粉等原辅材料，几个月就提供了２００多吨。此外，他们还经常免费帮助用户调试、检修设备，无论新疆还是广东，食、宿、行全部自理。为此，许多用户感叹道：看来还是买姑苏厂的设备最舒心。
