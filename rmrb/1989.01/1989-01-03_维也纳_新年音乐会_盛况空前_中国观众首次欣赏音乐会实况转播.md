　　维也纳“新年音乐会”盛况空前
    中国观众首次欣赏音乐会实况转播
    据新华社维也纳１月１日电  （记者肖力）一年一度蜚声世界的维也纳“新年音乐会”今天中午１２时在这里举行。维也纳爱乐乐团的演奏大师们在奥地利著名作曲家约翰·施特劳斯创作的《艺术家的生活》那欢快热烈的波尔卡舞曲声中拉开了音乐会的序幕。中国观众首次在电视的黄金时间欣赏了音乐会的实况转播。
    新年音乐会的举办地——维也纳音乐之友协会音乐厅的金色大厅华灯灿烂，富丽堂皇，呈现出一派节日气象。据报道，今天全世界五大洲数以亿万计的观众通过电视欣赏了这场新年音乐会，这是迄今世界上观众与听众最多的一次音乐会。
    著名音乐家卡罗斯·克莱伯尔指挥了这场音乐会。这位被此间音乐界誉为对施特劳斯作品及其风格理解最深的指挥家以其优美和精湛的指挥技巧赢得了奥地利及各国观众的喝彩。每当一曲终了，观众席上便是一片“勃拉伏”（好极了！）的喝采声和掌声。
    新年音乐会始于１９５９年，每年的１月１日举行。今年正是第３０场，根据历来的传统，每场音乐会必须是以奥地利人最喜爱的作曲家施特劳斯家族，即施特劳斯父子和兄弟所创作的作品为重点，由奥地利维也纳爱乐乐团演奏。在今天的音乐会上先后演奏了１１支施特劳斯父子于十九世纪创作的华尔兹和波尔卡舞曲，如欢乐明快的《春之声》和热情奔放的《匈牙利波尔卡》舞曲等。
    中国电视台首次通过卫星实况转播了这场音乐会，从而为维也纳新年音乐会增加了亿万观众，增添了新的光彩。
