Title: Price Reform – A Hot Topic in the Soviet Union Today

At the start of the new year, the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee Political Bureau held a meeting, with one of the topics being how to stop the phenomenon of price hikes. Due to long-term shortages of goods, to ease the supply-demand contradiction, the price authorities had raised the prices of some high-quality, low-price, high-demand goods significantly. However, some enterprises took this opportunity to arbitrarily raise prices under the guise of "new products." Rumors of price hikes for gasoline and building materials circulated at the end of last year, causing a wave of panic buying. To stabilize public sentiment, the government immediately refuted the rumors and decided to reduce the prices of some daily necessities by 10% to 30% starting this year.

The current price system in the Soviet Union was established during the period of extensive economic management and has become an obstacle to the current economic reforms. Currently, enterprises operating under the new management system account for 60% of the total industrial output value, and this will be fully implemented next year. If the price formation mechanism is not reformed, it will be difficult for enterprises to truly implement principles such as self-raised funds, self-balancing profits and losses, and complete economic accounting.

The current price system was centrally determined by the state in the past. Over the decades, regardless of changes in the economic domain, the price formation mechanism and retail prices have remained unchanged. Therefore, the prices of many products do not reflect the socially necessary consumption in the production and sales processes. Over the past 30 years, the average purchase price of agricultural products has increased by 3.6 times, with beef prices increasing by 10 times, far exceeding retail prices. The money a farmer earns from selling one kilogram of beef to the state can buy 2.5 kilograms of beef in a state-run store. The prices of fuel and raw materials are too low, causing these industries to be in long-term losses, while the prices of some industrial products are too high. Obviously, these highly irrational situations need to be changed.

As early as June 1987, the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party decided to carry out a "fundamental reform" of the price system. Now, the direction of price reform is basically determined, that is, to reduce the scope of state-centralized pricing, expand the pricing power of enterprises, and implement three types of prices: state prices, contract prices (negotiated prices), and autonomous prices. According to the government's preliminary plan, the reform will proceed in three steps: in January 1990, reform the wholesale prices of industrial products; in 1991, reform the budget prices of the construction industry and the purchase prices of agricultural products; finally, reform the retail prices, and cancel the subsidies for agricultural and sideline products, while compensating consumers. However, due to differing opinions and to proceed with caution, the specific implementation plan has not yet been released.

The issue of prices affects every household, and in a society where prices have remained unchanged for a long time, people are even more concerned. When, how, and how to compensate consumers have become hot topics. From street corners to Soviet meetings, from newspapers to radio and television, from scholars to officials, discussions have been held around this issue. The Soviet government is very cautious about price reform and plans to formulate an implementation plan after thorough deliberation and discussion, and submit it for national discussion in the first half of this year.

The academic community in the Soviet Union has engaged in heated discussions on this topic, and officials and experts from relevant departments have also actively participated. Although most people believe that the current price system must be reformed, there are differing opinions on how to reform and where to start, with some opinions being diametrically opposed and the debates intense. Scholars have different views on the indicative plan proposed by the State Price Committee, with some supporting and others opposing. One of the focal points of the debate is whether price increases are necessary, especially for food prices.

Those who oppose price increases believe that price increases are equivalent to protecting and subsidizing poorly managed enterprises, and are a concession to bureaucracy. After price increases, consumers must be compensated. Increasing wages universally will inevitably increase production costs, leading to price increases. After prices rise, wages must be increased again, and so on, which will inevitably lead to inflation. Therefore, they advocate that reforms should not start from the circulation sector but should focus on improving labor productivity and production efficiency in the production sector, first overcoming bureaucratism in production management. Some have calculated that if the planning, management, supply, and accounting systems of the agricultural sector are reformed, and the massive state agricultural committee system with 4 million employees is streamlined, then not only will there be no need to increase prices, but prices may even be reduced. They emphasize that price normalization should be the result of economic recovery.

Those who advocate for price increases believe that without rationalizing prices, any management system reform will not achieve significant results. The current prices, like bureaucracy, are important factors hindering reform because, in price formation, the "consumption viewpoint" still plays a role, and enterprises are keen on price increases rather than saving raw materials. Currently, agricultural reforms are progressing slowly, and it is unrealistic to expect production to improve within a year or two. To ease the supply-demand contradiction, either rationing must be implemented or prices must be increased to make prices adapt to changes in supply-demand conditions and fluctuations in production costs. Among those who advocate for price increases, some believe that the conditions for price increases are not yet in place and advocate for first reforming the savings business, currency, and commerce. It seems that this discussion will further deepen. Whether the reform can proceed as scheduled in January next year is currently difficult to predict.

　　价格改革——苏联当前的热门话题
    周象光
    新年伊始，苏共中央政治局开会，议题之一是如何制止乱涨价的现象。由于商品长期短缺，为缓解供求矛盾，物价当局曾对部分质优价低的高档抢手货大幅度提价。可是，有些企业借机以“新产品”为名跟着随意提价，去年底前后还流传过汽油、建材等要涨价的谣言，一度引起抢购风波。政府为稳定人心，一面立即辟谣，一面作出了从今年起对部分日用品降价１０％到３０％的决定。
    苏联现行的价格体制是经济粗放经营时期制定的，已成为当前推行经济改革的障碍。目前，实行新管理体制的企业已占工业总产值的６０％，一年后就将全面铺开。如不改革价格形成机制，企业的自筹资金、自负盈亏和完全的经济核算等原则就很难真正实现。
    现行价格体制是过去由国家集中制定的。几十年来，不管经济领域发生什么变化，价格形成机制和零售物价始终未变，因此，许多产品价格并不反映生产和销售过程中的社会必要消耗。近３０年来，农产品收购价平均提高了３．６倍，其中牛肉提高了１０倍，大大超过了零售价。农民向国家出售一公斤牛肉所得的钱，可在国营商店买回２．５公斤牛肉。燃料和原材料价格过低，使这些行业长期亏损，而有些工业产品价格又过高。显然，这些极不合理的状况是需要改变的。
    早在１９８７年６月，苏共中央全会就决定要对价格体制进行“根本改革”。现在，价格改革的方向大体已定，即缩小国家集中定价的范围，扩大企业定价权，实行国家价、合同价（议价）和自主价三种价格。根据政府的初步打算，改革将分三步走：１９９０年１月，改革工业品批发价格；１９９１年，改革建筑行业预算价格和农产品收购价格；最后，改革零售价格，并取消对农副产品的补贴，同时给消费者以补偿。但由于意见分歧，也为了慎重从事，具体实施方案至今尚未出台。
    物价问题涉及千家万户，在物价长期不动的苏联社会，人们对此更为关心。何时改革，如何改革，如何给消费者以补偿等问题就成了热门话题。从街头巷尾到苏维埃会议，从报刊到电台、电视台，从学者到官员，都围绕这个问题开展讨论。苏联政府对价格改革极为慎重，准备通过充分的酝酿和讨论后制定实施方案，并于今年上半年提交全民讨论。
    苏联学术界就此开展了热烈的讨论，有关部门的官员和专家也积极参加。虽然大多数人都认为现行的价格体制必须改革，但对怎样改革和改革应从何处入手，意见不一，有些意见相互对立，争论激烈。学者们对国家价格委员会提出的意向性方案，有的赞成，有的反对。争论的焦点之一是，提价有无必要，尤其是食品价格。
    反对提价者认为，提价等于保护和资助经营不善的企业，是对官僚主义的让步，而提价后又必须给消费者以补偿。普遍增加工资势必增加生产耗费，从而导致物价上涨。物价上涨后又必须再提高工资，如此循环下去，必然引起通货膨胀。因此，他们主张改革不应从流通领域入手，而应在生产领域提高劳动生产率和生产效益，首先要克服生产管理方面的官僚主义。有人核算，只要对农业部门的计划、管理、供应和核算体制进行改革，并对已拥有４００万工作人员的庞大的国家农工委系统实行精简，那么，非但可以不提价，甚至还可以降价。他们强调，价格正常化应当是经济恢复健康的结果。
    主张提价者认为，不理顺价格，任何管理体制的改革都不会取得明显的效果。现行的价格同官僚主义一样，是阻碍改革的重要因素，因为在价格形成方面，“消耗观点”仍起作用，企业热衷于提价，而不注意节约原材料。目前农业改革步履艰难，要在一两年内把生产搞上去是不现实的。为了缓解供求矛盾，要么实行凭票供应，要么提价，使价格按规律适应供求条件的变化和生产费用的波动。主张提价的人中也有人认为，目前尚不具备提价的条件，主张首先应对储蓄业务、货币和商业进行改革。看来，这种讨论还将进一步向深度发展。明年１月能否如期进行改革，目前尚难预测。
