The flames roared, and the brave firefighters battled against the blaze. Water cannons roared, and the fire dragons retreated...

On January 11, at a press conference held by the Wuhan Public Security Bureau, a videotape vividly replayed the fierce battle of "One, Two" to extinguish the oil barge fire.

This was an unusual videotape. For it, the deputy director of the Propaganda Section of the Wuhan Fire Brigade, Comrade Cheng Jīngfā, perished in the fire, and the camera sank into the river for seven days and seven nights.

Cheng Jīngfā's colleague, Propaganda Section officer Liu Fúbīn, took the camera retrieved from the river, gently wiped off the river mud with trembling hands, carefully took out the videotape, and performed meticulous technical processing such as drying. A miracle occurred: clear images, loud sounds, and the scorching fire-fighting scene appeared on the screen. He murmured, "This is what Comrade Cheng got with his life and blood!"

This was the last day of 1988. Little Liu arrived at the office on time and saw that Cheng Jīngfā, who had been on duty and inspecting the night before until late, was already sitting at his desk, with a few traces of fatigue still on his face. The two discussed the work for the coming year. Cheng Jīngfā told Little Liu that he wanted to take a hot bath. With so much work at the end of the year, he hadn't taken a bath for many days, and these days he had caught a severe cold, soaking in hot water to relieve his fatigue.

The queue at the bathhouse stretched like a snake. Cheng Jīngfā thought of Little Liu's wife who was hospitalized, and that he should go take care of his wife before the holidays. With this in mind, he returned to the office and told Little Liu: "The canteen will have a New Year's Eve dinner, you must come back early, and we'll have a 'family reunion meal' together. Tomorrow is New Year's Day, I'm on duty, so you can take care of your wife in peace!"

In the afternoon, after handling office matters, he could go on leave. Cheng Jīngfā picked up his clothes and prepared to take a bath. At this moment, someone reported that a driver was smoking at a gas station in the city center and did not heed warnings. Cheng Jīngfā immediately rushed to the scene and quickly handled this major fire hazard. Thus, until his martyrdom, he did not get to take a bath!

On New Year's Eve, he did not celebrate the holiday with his wife and daughter, but was on night duty at the office. Several days of hard work had worsened his cold. High fever made his head throb. He gritted his teeth and persisted until 2 a.m. on the 2nd, when he exchanged shifts, took a few cold pills, and stumbled home, falling asleep as soon as he hit the bed.

A sudden knock at the door woke Cheng Jīngfā from his brief sleep. He sat up and said, "I'm coming right away," then leaned back against the bed and fell asleep again. His wife helped him put on his shirt and found that his undershirt was completely soaked. This was after taking the cold medicine and sweating. His wife said with concern, "You really can't go, I'll go down and ask for leave for you."

Cheng Jīngfā said, "I can go, I'm leaving right away." He struggled to get out of bed.

The battlefield is the fire scene. This was a rare oil barge fire. As soon as Cheng Jīngfā arrived at the fire scene, he turned on the camera and knelt on the cold ground to shoot the burning crude oil. The soldiers boarded the ship to fight, and he also got on a small boat. Fatigue and severe cold made him fall several times on the small boat. Then he followed the on-site commander, Deputy Brigade Commander Li Jīnwén, and rushed onto the oil barge.

The flames scorched his face, and the thick smoke made him dizzy. This was the boundary between life and death. Cheng Jīngfā did not retreat. What he thought of was using the camera in his hand to record this struggle of blood and fire. Under the reflection of the flames, people saw him sometimes kneeling on both knees, sometimes standing up, skillfully using push, pull, shake, and move camera techniques, capturing wide shots, panoramic shots, medium shots, close-ups, and close-ups from all angles. He forgot that he was in the midst of the fire, he forgot the danger, to the point where the explosion point was under his feet and he was completely unaware.

Cheng Jīngfā, who was 45 this year, was born in the famous general county of Hubei Province, Hong'an County. His tall and sturdy figure made his comrades say he looked like a general. He enlisted in 1961 and was awarded the Third Class Merit; after being transferred to the public security fire brigade, he worked on the front line for more than 20 years, long-term political work. He was commended more than 10 times. In 1987, the brigade established the Propaganda Section, and he was transferred to be the deputy director. In two years, he not only mastered television, video, and photography techniques but also provided more than 70 news articles to various levels of news agencies. He went to the fire scene more than 100 times, shooting nearly 100 fire scene photos and video materials; he and others recorded the television specials "Fire, Fire, Fire" and "People Who Brave the Flames," which caused a great sensation in Wuhan, and CCTV also planned to broadcast them. In the past two years, he has used newspapers, radio, television, and other propaganda means to make the city's fire prevention propaganda colorful.

These outstanding achievements did not become his capital to demand from the party and the people. He only knew how to contribute. When evaluating military ranks, according to regulations, his position could only be evaluated as a major. However, his comrades who enlisted at the same time as him have many who have become colonels and generals; those who worked with him, who are younger than him, can also be evaluated as lieutenant colonels and colonels. Someone spoke up for him: "Honest people are at a disadvantage." But Cheng Jīngfā, like a general, was magnanimous: "The document has regulations, we should not compare."

　　用生命和鲜血换来的……
    ——记在扑救油驳大火中殉职的宣传干部程敬发
    本报记者  龚达发
    熊熊的烈火在燃烧，英勇的消防战士在扑救，水枪在怒吼，火龙在退缩……
    １月１１日，武汉市公安局新闻发布会上，录相带在荧屏上正生动再现“一、二”扑救油驳大火的恶战。
    这是一盘不平常的录相带，为了它，武汉市消防支队宣传科副科长程敬发同志葬身火海，录相机也沉入江中七天七夜。
    程敬发的战友、宣传科干事刘福斌接过从江中打捞起的录相机，用颤抖的手轻轻拭去机上的江泥，小心翼翼地取出录相带，认真进行干燥等技术处理，奇迹出现了：屏幕上出现清晰的画面，宏亮的声音，炽热的扑火场面。他喃喃地说：“这是程科长用生命和鲜血换来的！”
    这是１９８８年的最后一天。小刘按时来到办公室，看到前一天晚上值班、查班到深夜的程敬发已经坐在办公桌前，脸上还带着几丝疲倦。两人商量了一下明年的工作。程敬发告诉小刘，他想去洗个热水澡。年底事多，他已经好多天没有洗澡了，这几天又患了重感冒，泡泡热水解解乏。
    澡堂门口，队伍排成长蛇阵。程敬发想到小刘的爱人正在住院，节前应该让他去照顾一下妻子。想到这里，他又回到了办公室，告诉小刘：中午食堂会餐，你一定早些回来，咱们一起吃餐“团年饭”。明天是元旦，我值班，你就安心照顾爱人吧！
    下午，处理完办公室事务可以放假了。程敬发又拎着衣服准备去洗澡。这时，有人报告，一位司机在市中心的加油站吸烟，不听劝阻。程敬发立即赶到现场，迅速处理了这起重大火灾隐患。这样，直到牺牲前，也没有洗成澡！
    元旦之夜，他没有与妻子女儿欢度节日，而是在机关值夜班。几天的劳累，感冒加重了。高烧使他头痛欲裂。他咬着牙一直坚持到２日凌晨２时交班，才吃了几片感冒药，跌跌撞撞地回到家中，倒到床上就呼呼睡去。
    一阵急促的敲门声，把刚刚进入梦乡的程敬发惊醒。他应声坐起说了声“马上来”，又靠着床背睡着了。妻子帮他穿好上衣，发现他的衬衣全部湿透。这是吃感冒药以后在发汗。妻子心疼地说，“你实在不能去，我下去帮你请个假。”
    程敬发说了声“我能去，马上走。”说完挣扎着从床上跳起。
    火场就是战场。这是一次罕见的油驳大火。程敬发一到火场就打开录相机，跪在冰冷的地上拍摄原油燃烧的情景。战士们登船作战，他也上了小船，疲劳和重感冒，使他几次跌倒在小船上。随后他又紧跟现场指挥、副支队长李金文冲上了油驳。
    烈火灼得面部生疼，浓烟熏得头昏目眩。这里是生与死的分界。程敬发没有后退，他想到的是用手中的录相机记录这血与火的搏斗。在烈火的映照下，人们看到他时而双膝跪地，时而站起，熟练地运用推、拉、摇、移等录相技巧，把远景全景、中景近景、特写，全方位尽收镜头。他忘记了自己是置身火海，他忘记了危险，以致爆炸点在他的脚下他也全然不知。
    今年４５岁的程敬发，出身在著名的将军县——湖北省红安县。高大魁梧的身躯，战友们都说他像个将军。他１９６１年参军，曾荣立过三等功；转业后又在公安消防战线工作了２０多年，长期从事基层政治工作。１０多次受嘉奖。１９８７年，支队组建宣传科，他被调任副科长。两年时间，他不仅掌握了电视、录相、摄影等技术，还向各级新闻单位提供了７０多篇新闻。他上百次深入火场，拍摄了近百个火场照片、录相资料；他和别人一起录制的《火火火》、《赴汤蹈火的人们》等电视专题片，在武汉引起极大反响，中央电视台也打算播出。两年来，他通过报纸、广播、电视以及其他宣传手段，把全市的防火宣传搞得有声有色。
    这些突出的成绩并没有成为他向党和人民索取的资本。他只知道奉献。评定警衔，按规定他的职务只能评少校。而与他同时入伍的战友不少人扛上了上校、大校牌牌；与他一起工作的，年纪比他小也可以评为中校、上校。有人为他鸣不平：“老实人吃亏。”可是程敬发像将军一样大度：“文件有规定，我们不要搞攀比。”
