Due to corruption and bribery, the U.S. Department of Defense overpaid military contractors by $2.1 billion in the first nine months of last year.

The Washington Post today quoted Pentagon Inspector General Joan Brown as saying that the methods used by Department of Defense officials for corruption and bribery are becoming increasingly sophisticated. For example, they use deception to manipulate bidding processes and arrange jobs for their relatives during the bidding process.

Brown said that in the past 12 months, the Pentagon's inspection department has convicted 299 cases of corruption and bribery, recovering nearly $300 million in illicit funds and fines.

　　美国防部官员贪污受贿严重
    新华社华盛顿１月１日电  由于贪污受贿，美国国防部在去年头９个月中，向军火承包商多付了２１亿美元。
    《华盛顿邮报》今天援引五角大楼监察长琼·布朗的话说，国防部官员贪污受贿的手法越来越新，譬如他们用欺骗的办法操纵招标和在招标中为自己的亲属安排工作等等。
    布朗说，在过去１２个月里，五角大楼的监察部门给２９９个贪污受贿案定了罪，共追回了将近３亿美元的赃款和罚金。
