The Agricultural Bank of China recently issued a notice to its branches, instructing them to expedite the settlement of "white receipts" issued by procurement departments due to funding shortages during the 1988 agricultural and sideline product procurement, as well as the "convertible savings passbook" issued by the Agricultural Bank. The goal is to redeem all "white receipts" held by farmers before the Spring Festival. For the "convertible savings passbook," the bank will respect the farmers' wishes and redeem them in cash if requested, ensuring that farmers can have a joyful Spring Festival.

It is understood that despite the significant increase in agricultural and sideline product procurement quantities and prices last year, leading to a pronounced mismatch between supply and demand for funds, the Agricultural Bank made considerable efforts. They actively took measures to raise funds from various sources, issuing a total of 166.8 billion yuan in loans for agricultural and sideline product procurement, an increase of 31.1 billion yuan compared to the previous year, marking a growth of nearly 23%. By December 25, the bank supported commercial departments in procuring 95% of the grain and 74.6% of the cotton procurement tasks. Nevertheless, it is estimated that by the end of last year, the total value of "white receipts" issued nationwide still amounted to 20-30 billion yuan. Farmers have expressed strong dissatisfaction with this situation. Currently, the Agricultural Bank is working to ensure the redemption of "white receipts" and the funding for cross-year procurement of agricultural and sideline products.

To ensure a reasonable supply of funds for agricultural and sideline product procurement and prevent the recurrence of the "white receipts" issue, the state has preliminarily decided to implement specialized management of agricultural and sideline product procurement funds. Concurrently, the Agricultural Bank plans to increase agricultural and sideline product procurement funds by 10 billion yuan this year.

　　农业银行通知各分行    
    农民手中“白条”春节前兑现     
    国家将对农副产品收购资金实行专项管理
    本报讯  记者江夏报道：中国农业银行日前发出通知，要求各分行抓紧对去年农副产品收购中，一些地方的收购部门因为资金紧张打出的“白条”和农业银行开出的“定活两便转帐支票”进行清理，在春节前全部兑现农民手中的“白条”，对于“定活两便转帐支票”则尊重农民的意愿，愿意兑成现金的给予兑现，让农民高高兴兴过年。
    据了解，农行去年在农副产品收购量增加，价格上升幅度较大，资金供求矛盾突出的情况下，尽了很大努力，积极采取措施，多方筹集资金，累计发放收购农副产品贷款１６６８亿元，比上年同期增加３１１亿元，增长近２３％。截至１２月２５日，支持商业部门收购的粮食、棉花分别占收购任务的９５％和７４．６％。尽管如此，到去年底全国打出的“白条”金额据估计仍有２０—３０亿元。农民对此很有意见。目前，农行正在落实兑现“白条”和跨年度收购农副产品的资金。
    为了保证对农副产品资金的合理供应，避免“白条”问题的再次出现，国家已初步决定对农副产品收购资金实行专项管理。同时，农行今年计划增加１００亿元农副产品收购资金。
