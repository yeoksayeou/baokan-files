Wang Zhen, Vice Chairman of the State and Chairman of the China Primary and Secondary School and Kindergarten Teachers' Award Foundation, said on the afternoon of January 29 that the current phenomenon of students disliking school and teachers disliking teaching on the education front is worth noting. He pointed out that if effective measures are not taken to overcome this, it will affect the development of China's education cause, the modernization drive, and the future of the nation.

Wang Zhen, along with Liang Guangda, Secretary of the Zhuhai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, listened to reports from relevant leaders and teacher representatives. He fully affirmed the efforts made by Zhuhai City to improve and enhance teachers' treatment and develop the education cause. Wang Zhen said that in the past year, teachers across the country have worked hard to cultivate the next generation for the motherland. We extend our New Year greetings to all comrades engaged in educational work nationwide and express our heartfelt thanks. We wish them greater achievements in the new year.

Wang Zhen pointed out that education is not only a major issue related to whether China's four modernizations can be realized, but also a major issue related to the rise and fall of the country and the survival of the nation. Various levels of government must take effective measures to improve teachers' working and living conditions, stabilize, consolidate, and develop the teaching team. Broad masses of educators should carry forward the spirit of dedication, devote themselves to the education cause, and send more talents in various fields to the socialist modernization construction of the country. When talking about the methods of teaching and educating people, Wang Zhen stressed that it is important to pay attention to moral education for students. Various types of schools and educational departments should play an important role in the construction of the two civilizations of socialism. Efforts should be made to carry out patriotic education and education on excellent national traditions among students, so that students can establish a sense of national pride and self-respect from a young age, and become a new generation of socialists with ideals, morality, culture, and discipline. This will further improve the overall quality of the Chinese nation.

　　王震说厌学厌教现象值得注意    
    他指出这关系到国家兴衰民族存亡
    新华社广州１月３０日电  国家副主席、中国中小学幼儿教师奖励基金会理事长王震２９日下午在珠海市会见１００多名教师代表时说，现在教育战线上出现的学生厌学、教师厌教的现象值得注意，应采取有力措施加以克服，否则会影响我国教育事业的发展，影响我国的四化建设和民族前途。
    王震同中共珠海市委书记梁广大等听取了有关领导和教师代表的汇报，对珠海市改善和提高教师待遇、发展教育事业所做的努力，给予充分的肯定。王震说，在过去的一年里，全国广大中小学幼儿教师为培育祖国的下一代付出了辛勤劳动，我们向全国从事教育工作的同志们拜年，并向他们表示衷心感谢，祝他们在新的一年里取得更大成绩。
    王震指出，教育不仅是关系到我国四个现代化能否实现的大事，而且是关系到国家兴衰、民族存亡的大事。各级政府一定要采取有效措施，改善教师的工作和生活条件，稳定、巩固和发展教师队伍。广大教育工作者要发扬奉献精神，献身于教育事业，为国家的社会主义现代化建设更多地输送各方面人才。谈到教书育人的方法时，王震强调，要重视对学生进行德育教育，各类学校和教育部门要在社会主义两个文明建设中发挥重要作用。要在学生中大力开展爱国主义教育、民族优秀传统的教育，使学生从小就树立起民族自尊心、自豪感，做社会主义有理想、有道德、有文化、有纪律的一代新人，从而使整个中华民族素质得到进一步提高。
