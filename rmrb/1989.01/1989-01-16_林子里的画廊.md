The Art Gallery in the Woods

By Zhu Weiqun, Correspondent of People's Daily

In the small grove next to the Drum Tower in the center of Nanjing, an open-air art gallery has appeared since last spring. I had passed by several times and seen from a distance the banner "Cultural Market" hanging high among the green trees, with calligraphy and paintings hanging underneath, and crowds of people. But I always thought it was just a low-brow affair and didn't bother to visit. Recently, I happened to stop by and ended up spending the whole afternoon there.

The first impression was "miscellaneous." Paintings, sculptures, woodcuts, calligraphy, seals, and decorative crafts were all lined up in rows, totaling about forty to fifty stalls. I had never seen a museum that could exhibit so many different types of works at the same time. The authors were also diverse: workers, cadres, teachers, students, soldiers... from the elderly in their seventies and eighties to children a few years old. As long as one had the courage, they could bring their works to "expose" them. The skill levels were also varied. Some paintings looked very childish or vulgar, but some were obviously the work of well-trained hands. As for prices, there were large paintings priced at several hundred yuan, and small decorations for a few yuan, and most were priced according to the market. Almost all the stall owners were the authors themselves. A piece of calligraphy or painting priced at ten or twenty yuan, if you truly liked it but were short on cash, might be sold to you for just a few yuan. If both parties got along well, it might even be given to you for free.

A young man holding a child had works made of copper wires of different thicknesses bent into the shapes of people or animals, fixed on white paper. The lines were simple and smooth, and the shapes were accurate and vivid. His name was Zheng Wenhao, and he was a worker at a handkerchief factory. He said, "These are my own creations. In the past, I hung them at home to admire myself, but now I bring them out for everyone to see. It's a kind of self-satisfaction and also adds a bit of cultural atmosphere to society." Seeing that I was not an "art ignoramus," he insisted on giving me one, without taking any money. Later, a few artists from the art academy saw this copper wire art and praised it highly, saying it was indeed an artistic innovation.

The "Provincial Senior Calligraphy and Painting Friendship Association," composed of retired cadres, also hung up their calligraphy and paintings here. A few old comrades said: After retirement, one can't just pass the time watching TV and playing mahjong. People need some creative activities. Many people have become obsessed with calligraphy and painting. At first, they were a bit embarrassed to come here to sell their paintings, but now they feel that if they don't come once, it's like something is missing from their life.

Perhaps what attracts them is the cultural atmosphere here. People who come here seem to become more refined, more willing to talk and make friends. Many stalls are run by fathers and sons, teachers and students, husbands and wives, classmates, and so on. A 10-year-old girl, Zhu Xiaoting, was brought by her mother to sell her paintings. Her paintings were bold in ink and bright in color, with a bit of boldness mixed with innocence. Her mother praised her daughter and then her husband: "My husband is a designer at the factory and now teaches eight children to paint for free. We really want to hold a personal exhibition for our daughter, but we can't afford the venue fee! Here, the child can also see the world. Now that paper and ink have become more expensive, the money from selling paintings is all used to buy paper and ink for her, which also encourages her to develop a sense of independence from a young age."

Foreign tourists come to visit every day. At such times, the student artists are particularly spirited, chattering non-stop about their works, haggling over prices, and not caring whether the work is theirs or someone else's—this also becomes an opportunity for them to practice their English. Some students return here after the art gallery closes in the evening—to them, this place is also Nanjing's English Corner at night.

The cultural market initially did not charge for setting up stalls, but now it charges one yuan per stall as a management fee. It opens every Saturday and Sunday. The manager, Old Hu, is also an art enthusiast. He said, "The district art association set up this market to provide a venue for unknown authors to exhibit and sell their works. Their paintings may not yet meet the conditions for entering an exhibition hall, but their artworks also have the right to be selected and judged by society. On the other hand, people's material lives have improved, and they are beginning to pursue spiritual life, including using artworks to decorate their living spaces. However, the paintings in large exhibitions and large art stores, even reproductions, are sold for several hundred to a thousand yuan. How many ordinary people can afford that? But the cultural market can play a role in bridging this gap."

"Have there been any famous painters who came to exhibit and sell their works?"

"There have already been painters who asked others to bring their works to sell, but none have personally come yet, perhaps they are afraid of losing face? However, we believe that as the cultural market becomes better and better, and folk art rises and flourishes, they will eventually come."

　　林子里的画廊
    本报记者  朱维群
    南京市中心鼓楼旁的小树林里，从去年春天起出现一处露天画廊。以前几次路过，远远望见绿树丛中高悬“文化市场”的横幅，下面挂满字画，人头攒动，但总以为那不过“下里巴人”档次，不屑光顾。最近偶一涉足，竟盘桓整整一下午。
    第一印象是“杂”。绘画、雕塑、木刻、书法、印章、工艺装饰品，一溜一溜排了四五十摊，没见过哪家美术馆能同时展出这么多种类作品。作者队伍也杂，工人、干部、教师、学生、军人……上至七八十岁老人，下至几岁的娃娃，只要有这个勇气，都可以把作品拿来“曝光”。水平更是参差不齐，有些画看上去很幼稚或俗气，但有些一看就知出自训练有素之手。价格嘛，有索价几百元的大幅，也有几元一个的小摆设，而且大都随行就市。摊主几乎全是作者本人，标十几元的一幅字画，看你是真喜欢而又囊中羞涩，没准几元钱就让你拿走。如果双方谈得投机，白送你也行。
    一个抱着孩子的青年，他的作品是用不同粗细的铜丝弯曲成人物或动物形象，固定在白纸上，线条简洁流畅，造型准确生动。他叫郑文钊，是手帕厂工人。他说：“这是我自己的创作。过去挂在家里自我欣赏，现在拿出来请大家看看，既是一种自我满足，也给社会添点文明气氛。”他看我还不是个“艺盲”，执意要我挑一幅，不收钱。后来几位艺术学院的画家看到这幅铜丝画，大为欣赏，说实在是一种艺术创新。
    由退休干部组成的“省老年书画联谊会”也在这里挂起字画。几位老同志说：退休了，不能光靠看电视、打麻将过日子。人总得有点创造性活动，不少人就迷上了书画。起初来这里卖画，大家还不太好意思，现在反而觉得一次不来，就像生活里欠缺点什么。
    使他们着迷的也许正是这里的文化氛围。人到了这里，仿佛都温文尔雅起来，变得爱交谈，爱交朋友。不少摊位是父子、师生、夫妻、同学共同经营的。１０岁小姑娘朱小亭，由妈妈领着来卖画。她的画落墨大胆、用色明快，稚嫩中透着股泼辣劲。她妈妈夸了女儿又夸丈夫：“我爱人是厂里美工，现在还义务教着８个孩子画画。我们很想给女儿办个人画展，可出不起那场地费呀！在这里，孩子也可以见世面。现在纸墨都涨价，卖画的钱全给她买纸墨，也促使她从小养成自主自立的意识。”
    外国旅游者来逛的终日不断。每到此时，学生画家们格外来精神，喋喋不休地介绍作品，讨价还价，也不管这作品是自己的还是别人的——这又成了他们练习外语的机会。有些学生在画廊散场之后，到附近随便吃点什么又返回这里——这儿晚上又是南京的英语角。
    文化市场起初设摊不收费，现在每个摊位收一元管理费。每周六和每星期日开张。管理员老胡也是个美术爱好者，他说：“区美协办这个市场，是为那些未成名的作者提供个展销场地。他们的画进展览馆可能还不具备条件，但他们的艺术作品也有权接受社会选择和社会鉴别。另一方面，群众物质生活改善了，开始追求精神生活，包括用艺术作品装饰自己的生活空间。可是大展览、大画店的画，复制品都卖到几百元、上千元，老百姓有几个敢问津？而文化市场可以在这个领域发挥一种沟通作用。”
    “那么，有没有知名画家来展销的？”
    “已经有画家托人将作品带来卖的，亲自出面的还没有，也许是怕跌身价吧？不过，我们相信，随着文化市场越办越好，民间艺术崛起和兴盛，早晚他们也会来的。”
