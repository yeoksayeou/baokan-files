Editor's Note: Agricultural insurance, especially for livestock, is challenging and has high payout rates. Many places are reluctant to engage in this business due to fears of losses. However, the Shanghai Insurance Company has taken on this challenge, treating the development of pig farming insurance as a crucial part of serving the "Vegetable Basket Project" and solving the problem of meat supply for urban and rural residents. Their approach is worth emulating by other regions.

According to a report by our correspondent Wang Jinhu: The Shanghai Insurance Company is actively developing pig farming insurance to address the concerns of pig farmers in the suburbs, achieving good social and economic benefits. In 1988, the company insured 2,160,000 pigs, an increase of 414,000 from the previous year; the premium income was 2.19 million yuan, a growth of 20.89% from the previous year.

Recently, Fang Zhimin, Deputy Director of the Domestic Property Department of the Shanghai Insurance Company, introduced their main approaches to our correspondent:

First, they adopted a method of comprehensive insurance for the entire township to expand the coverage and reduce the payout rate. Currently, 141 townships in the city have implemented comprehensive insurance, covering 67% of the area.

Second, they collaborated with township sideline companies or veterinary departments for co-insurance, rewarding veterinary stations that reduced the payout rate. This not only solved the problems of collecting premiums and investigating and assessing damages but also motivated veterinarians to implement pig disease prevention and control measures, reducing the mortality rate. Shanghai County's payout rate was as high as 143% in previous years, but it dropped to 80% after implementing co-insurance.

Third, they improved the insurance clauses and formulated reasonable rates, encouraging farmers to take more responsibility and reduce pig mortality. In Baoshan County, four pilot townships insured 110,000 pigs, and so far, there have been no claims.

It is understood that based on the municipal government's plan to vigorously develop sideline food production and improve the "Vegetable Basket Project," the Shanghai Insurance Company will further consolidate pig insurance this year and develop dairy cow insurance.

　　上海市积极发展养猪保险
    编者按：农村种养业保险难度大，赔付率高，许多地方怕亏本，不愿发展这项业务。上海市保险公司知难而上，把发展养猪保险作为服务“菜篮子工程”、解决城乡人民吃肉问题的一项重要业务来抓。他们的做法值得各地借鉴。
    本报讯　记者王锦鹄报道：上海市保险公司积极发展养猪保险，解决郊县养猪户的后顾之忧，取得了较好的社会效益和经济效益。１９８８年，全市承保生猪达２１６万头，比上年增加４１．４万头；收入保费２１９万元，比上年增长２０．８９％。
    最近，上海市保险公司国内财产部副经理房志敏向记者介绍了他们的主要做法：
    一是采取全乡统保的办法，扩大承保面，降低赔付率。目前，全市已有１４１个乡实行统保，承保面达６７％。
    二是与乡副业公司或兽医部门实行共保，对赔付率降低的兽医站给予奖励。这样不仅解决了收取保费、查勘定损等问题，而且有利于调动兽医的积极性，落实生猪防病防疫措施，减少死亡率。上海县前几年赔付率高达１４３％，实行共保后下降到８０％。
    三是完善保险条款，制订合理费率，促使饲养户增强责任心，减少生猪死亡。宝山县４个试点乡，承保生猪１１万头，至今未发生一起赔案。
    据了解，上海市保险公司根据市政府大力发展副食品生产、搞好菜篮子工程的规划，今年将进一步巩固生猪保险，并发展奶牛保险。
