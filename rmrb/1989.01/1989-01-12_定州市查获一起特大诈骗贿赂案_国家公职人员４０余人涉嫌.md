Recently, Dingzhou City in Hebei Province uncovered a major case of fraud amounting to 1,970,000 yuan and bribery totaling over 200,000 yuan. The case involves more than 40 state officials.

The perpetrator, Wen Gaiping, is a resident of Lingbei Village, Mingyuesi Township, Dingzhou City. Since 1987, she bribed Li Tongsuo, the accountant of the Lingbei Village Credit Union, to issue fake deposit slips totaling 1,440,000 yuan. Under the pretense of being able to provide color televisions, she defrauded Hebei Provincial Television University, Taiyuan City's Xishan Mining Bureau in Shanxi Province, Dingzhou City's Zhao Jiawo Supply and Marketing Cooperative, and Dingzhou City's South Street Market, among other entities, of a total of 1,978,000 yuan. During the fraud process, Wen Gaiping bribed more than 40 people in the public security, court, commerce, and agricultural bank sectors with over 200,000 yuan.

Last August, Wen Gaiping, under the guise of purchasing color televisions, signed a 660,000 yuan supply contract with the Hebei Provincial Television University's Educational Technology Department Development Company. The purchasing party requested that the contract be notarized. Wen then used the Mingyuesi Court's name to authenticate the contract through the court's chief judge, Zhao Dejin. Zhao Dejin and another court official, Liu Gaishun, each demanded a color television from Wen. In September of the same year, Wen was caught by the commerce department for operating without a license and selling counterfeit color televisions. The commerce department planned to fine her 100,000 yuan. Wen then used her connections to find Liu Suomei, an official in the North City District Letters and Visits Office of Dingzhou City. Liu and her husband, Jia Zhanchen (Deputy Chief of the Dingzhou City Public Security Bureau), approached the case handlers, including Liu Chunhua from the city's public security bureau criminal investigation team and Wang Heying, the head of the city's commerce bureau's economic inspection team, and Liu Junjie, an economic inspector, to plead on her behalf. Eventually, the fine was reduced to 40,000 yuan. Liu Suomei and Jia Zhanchen received 7,000 yuan in cash and two color televisions from Wen; Wang Heying received 2,000 yuan in cash, and Liu Junjie received 2,000 yuan in cash and one color television.

Additionally, during the process of Wen Gaiping opening accounts, withdrawing cash, and obtaining loans, Zhang Guohui, the cashier of the Mingyuesi Township branch of the Dingzhou City Agricultural Bank, demanded nearly 43,000 yuan in cash and one refrigerator, bicycle, stereo system, and a bed set; cashier Hou Junjie demanded 44,000 yuan in cash and one refrigerator, color television, stereo system, and double bed; accountant You Jianxia received 86,000 yuan in cash and one color television, bicycle, and electric fan; cashier Yang Jianzhang received 13,000 yuan in cash and one color television and bicycle; employee Liu Qingshen received 19,000 yuan in cash and one color television; the accountant of the Lingbei Credit Union, Li Tongsuo, received 11,000 yuan in cash and one black-and-white television.

Currently, the procuratorate has recovered 539,000 yuan in illicit funds, 20 color televisions, 3 refrigerators, 9 bicycles, 3 tape recorders, 1 electric fan, and 2 beds. The case is still under investigation.
