The Athlete Representing 300 Million People - A Record of Shot Put Athlete Li Meisu

Before 1987, although Li Meisu had won the national championship multiple times, her shot put had never flown out of Asia. In the eyes of ordinary people, the 29-year-old Li Meisu was already "old," because in the past 30 years, no Chinese shot put athlete had continued to compete beyond the age of 27. However, Li Meisu frequently appeared on the sports field and on the podium. On March 28, 1987, during the Beijing Regional Excellent Athletes Track and Field Competition, Li Meisu threw 19.40 meters, breaking the 2-year-old Asian record of 18.93 meters held by her teammate Cong Yuzhen.

In just three months, she rewrote the Asian women's shot put record five times, improving her personal best by more than two meters, and became the first Asian woman to break the 20-meter barrier.

Li Meisu was physically strong from a young age and loved sports. She started practicing shot put in the sports class at Xinle County Middle School in Hebei Province. A few years later, she became one of the top women's shot put athletes in China. In 1985, an injury forced her to withdraw from the Asian Athletics Championships. At that time, everyone thought Li Meisu would fade away. No one expected that, in order to participate in the Olympics, Li Meisu made a comeback after marriage. Some people predicted that she, approaching the age of 30, would find it difficult to create miracles again. Strangely, in the past two years, she has entered her golden age, with her performance improving steadily and rapidly.

How did the miracle happen? Li Meisu's coach, He Zengsheng, said that shot put is a down-to-earth sport with no room for luck or shortcuts. Take Li Meisu's strength training, for example; it all involves dealing with barbells. With over 200 pounds of barbell on her shoulders, she repeatedly stands up and squats down. Li Meisu has to pay a greater price than others. She fights with her body and the shot put with superhuman willpower. After each day's training, her arms are powerless, and her calves are swollen. She lies down on the bed, but her legs don't know how to get into the covers. She often has to make several decisions before she can crawl into the bed. To help Li Meisu relax her muscles and recover her strength after training, Coach He massages her for over an hour every day, tiring both teacher and student until they are both covered in sweat. When practicing throwing techniques, she twisted her waist but did not stop practicing. Every day after training, she would inch her way back to the dormitory. Even if a handkerchief fell to the ground, she would have to make several decisions before she could grit her teeth and pick it up in pain.

Li Meisu raised the first and only five-star red flag for the motherland at the Seoul Olympics track and field event. She was the only Asian track and field athlete to stand on the podium, but she felt guilty, as if she had done something wrong. Someone saw her quietly take off her bronze medal and tuck it into the bouquet.

At a celebration held by the Hebei Provincial Sports Commission for the Olympic athletes, someone regretted that Li Meisu missed the silver medal by just one centimeter. Li Meisu shook her head: "You can't look at it that way. The difference isn't one centimeter; 21.06 meters is still 60 centimeters away from my best performance. I only blame myself for not performing well and don't blame any other objective reasons." The simple words contained the strict self-discipline of an old athlete and a high sense of responsibility for the honor of the motherland.

Li Meisu achieved greatness late in life and had a difficult journey.

After the Olympics, she once thought of "retiring to her hometown." But when she thought of the gap of one meter between the Chinese and Asian women's shot put records and the world record, her stubborn and unyielding spirit returned: If I can continue to maintain my current level, I plan to compete for a few more years. Even if I can reduce that gap by one centimeter, two centimeters...

This is Li Meisu, a Chinese woman who, at the age of 30, still strives for excellence, the daughter of an ordinary farmer.

　　代表３０亿人的获奖者
    ——记铅球运动员李梅素
    １９８７年以前，李梅素虽然多次荣获全国冠军，但她的铅球却从未飞出亚洲。在一般人眼里，２９岁的李梅素已经“老”了，因为３０多年来，中国的铅球运动员没有一个超过２７岁仍在拚搏。然而，李梅素还是频繁地出现在运动场上，频繁地出现在领奖台上。１９８７年３月２８日，北京地区优秀运动员田径比赛中，李梅素投出了１９．４０米，震醒了酣睡２年由队友丛玉珍保持的１８．９３米的亚洲纪录。
    短短的３个月内，她把亚洲女子铅球纪录改写了５次，把自己的最好成绩提高了两米多，成为亚洲第一个突破２０米大关的女子铅球运动员。
    李梅素从小身体结实，喜爱体育，在河北新乐县中学体育班读书时就练起了铅球。几年后成为国内女子铅球佼佼者。１９８５年，伤病迫使她退出了亚洲田径锦标赛。一时间，人们都以为李梅素从此将销声匿迹。谁也没想到，为了参加奥运会，李梅素婚后复出。有人预料，接近“而立之年”的她很难再创奇迹。奇怪的是近两年来她反倒进入黄金岁月，成绩提高非常稳定、迅速。
    奇迹是怎样出现的呢？李梅素的教练何增生说，铅球是个实打实的项目，没有半点侥幸或捷径可言。就说李梅素的力量训练吧，都是和杠铃打交道，２００多斤的杠铃压在肩上，起立、下蹲，周而复始。李梅素要付出比别人更大的代价，她是用超人的毅力与肌体搏斗，与铅球搏斗。每天训练结束，手臂无力，小腿胀痛，铺好被子坐在床边，双腿不知该怎样提上床，常常要下好几次决心才能伸进被窝。为了帮助李梅素训练后肌肉放松，恢复体力，何教练天天为她按摩一个多小时，累得师徒都满头大汗。练投掷技术扭了腰，她不肯中断练习，每天训练完一步步蹭回宿舍，即使手绢掉到地上，也得下好半天决心，方能咬牙忍痛把它捡起来。
    李梅素在汉城奥运会田径场上为祖国升起了第一面也是唯一一面五星红旗。她是亚洲田径选手唯一登上领奖台的，却像做错了事一样自责，有人看到她悄悄摘下铜牌，掖在花束里。
    在河北省体委举办的奥运会健儿联欢会上，有人为李梅素和银牌的成绩只差一厘米而可惜，李梅素摇了摇头：“不能这样看问题，差距不是一厘米，２１．０６米与我的最好成绩还差６０多厘米。我只怨自己发挥得不好，不怪其它客观原因”。纯朴的话里包含着一名老运动员对自己的严格要求和对祖国荣誉崇高的责任心。
    李梅素大器晚成，路走得很难。
    奥运会后，她曾想过“告老还乡”，当想起中国和亚洲女子铅球纪录与世界纪录还有１米之遥的差距时，她那生性倔强总不服气的劲头又来了：如果能继续保持目前的水平，我准备再拚几年，哪怕能把那差距缩短一厘米，两厘米……
    这就是李梅素，而立之年拚搏不已的中国女性，一个普通农民的女儿。　张有德
