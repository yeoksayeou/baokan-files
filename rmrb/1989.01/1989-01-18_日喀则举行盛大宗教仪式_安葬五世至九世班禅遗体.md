A grand religious ceremony was held in Shigatse to bury the remains of the 5th to 9th Panchen Lamas. The ceremony was presided over by Panchen Erdeni Qojyijabzang, honorary president of the Buddhist Association of China.

The remains of the 5th to 9th Panchen Lamas were buried in a new stupa called "Dongling Zhashinangjie" at the Tashilhunpo Monastery in Shigatse, Tibet. The ceremony began in the afternoon when Panchen Erdeni Qojyijabzang arrived at the stupa. Lamas from the Tashilhunpo Monastery, holding various ritual instruments and blowing large and small conch shells, welcomed the remains of the Panchen Lamas with a grand religious ceremony.

The remains were placed in five sandalwood coffins, each adorned with colorful and auspicious khatas. As the lamas, carrying the coffins and blowing conch shells, walked under yellow parasols, thousands of monks and lay believers paid their respects. The coffins were then carried into the main hall of the Tashilhunpo Monastery, where they were circled three times around the thrones of the previous Panchen Lamas. When the coffins were carried to the new stupa, they were greeted by Panchen Erdeni Qojyijabzang, holding incense, and by Gejia Living Buddha, the teacher of Panchen Lama, and Hotse, deputy secretary of the Tibet Autonomous Region Party Committee. Panchen Lama then offered khatas to the coffins and personally placed them inside the "Dongling Zhashinangjie" stupa.
