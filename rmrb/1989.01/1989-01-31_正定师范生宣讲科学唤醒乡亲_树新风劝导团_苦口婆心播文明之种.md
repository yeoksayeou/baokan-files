A banner reading "Promoting New Customs Guidance Team" was prominently displayed, and a makeshift stage was set up with a couple of tables. Several young students were giving speeches. The crowd gathered around, eyes wide open, and two young rural women wiped away tears from their eyes...

This was a touching scene that the reporter witnessed recently at the city market in Xinle County, Hebei Province. According to a comrade from the county's propaganda department, the young people giving speeches in the cold wind were students from Zhengding Normal School. Their "Promoting New Customs Guidance Team" had come here twice, each time attracting quite a few listeners.

The reporter stood in the crowd for an hour, listening to several of the young people's speeches. Their words were sincere and heartfelt, touching the hearts of the listeners. Li Sulian's speech on "Family" used numerous real-life examples to list the harms caused by feudal superstitions, gambling, arranged marriages, and spoiling children. She called on people to create happy and harmonious family lives and to establish a new spirit of socialist civilization. Yu Xiaoyan's speech, "An 18-Year-Old Bride," recounted the tragic fate of a rural girl, exposing the evil of buying and selling marriages, and urged people to stand up and fight against such tragedies.

The team leader, the school's Communist Youth League secretary Qu Liankun, seemed a bit excited. He said, "Most of the students at Zhengding Normal School come from rural areas. They can't bear to see their fellow villagers harmed by bad habits. Therefore, based on extensive social investigations, they voluntarily organized this guidance team. Their goal is to use scientific and civilized knowledge to awaken their fellow villagers and to show their respect and love for their elders. They have already visited four counties during holidays, speaking wherever they go, and the results have been quite good."

During the students' speeches, the crowd occasionally murmured, "Oh, that's right!" Suddenly, the reporter noticed an elderly woman with white hair pulling the hand of Li Sulian, who had just finished speaking, and saying, "Girl, if only my good-for-nothing son could hear these words of yours!"

　　正定师范生宣讲科学唤醒乡亲     
    “树新风劝导团”苦口婆心播文明之种
    本报讯  记者杨振武报道：一条“树新风劝导团”的横幅当空撑起，两张桌子临时搭起的讲台上，几位青年学生在演讲。围拢过来的人们一个个瞪大眼睛，两位农村姑娘轻轻拭去眼窝的泪花……
    这是记者日前在冀中新乐县城集贸市场上看到的动人一幕。据县委宣传部的同志说，寒风中演讲的青年是正定师范学校的学生，他们组成的“树新风劝导团”已来这里两次，每次都赢得不少听众。
    记者在人群中驻足一小时，听了几位青年的演讲，情真意切，动人心弦。李素丽同学的演讲以“家庭”为题，用生活中大量的事实，历数封建迷信、赌博、包办婚姻、娇惯子女造成的危害，呼吁人们创造美满和谐的幸福生活，树立一代社会主义精神文明的新风。于晓燕同学演讲《１８岁的少妇》时，用一个农村少女的悲惨遭遇，诉说了买卖婚姻的罪恶，劝导人们奋起抗争，不能让这种悲剧重演。
    带队的校团委书记曲连坤显得有些激动。他说，正定师范的学生大多来自农村，他们不忍心看到父老乡亲们受不良风气的侵害，于是，在广泛社会调查的基础上，自发地组织起这个劝导团，目的是要用科学文明知识唤醒乡亲，为父老们尽一份“孝心”。他们利用节假日已经跑了４个县，到哪讲到哪，效果还不错。
    在同学们演讲时，人群里不时发出小声议论：“噢，还真是这个理儿！”猛然间，记者发现，一位白发老大娘正拉着刚刚演讲的李素丽同学唠叨：“闺女，你的这些话，要是让我那不争气的儿子听听就好了！”
