    The People's Daily has learned from the National Audit Office that since last year, local audit agencies have conducted audits of the agricultural production materials industry. The results indicate that some agricultural materials enterprises have serious violations of policies and financial disciplines in the distribution and management of fertilizers and pesticides. In audits of more than 3,200 agricultural materials enterprises and grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives in 18 provinces and cities, including Heilongjiang, Fujian, Guangdong, and Shaanxi, violations amounting to 280 million yuan were uncovered, of which 63 million yuan should be turned over to the treasury.

    In the distribution of fertilizers, the phenomenon of layer-by-layer reduction of planned quotas is quite common. The audit investigation in Fujian Province shows that for every 100 tons of fertilizer allocated, after being reduced by the provincial, municipal, county, township, and village levels, only about 30 tons are left for farmers. The reduced quota fertilizers and indicators are mostly sold at market prices by agricultural materials enterprises or allocated to internal staff and relatives. The Zhejiang Province Agricultural Materials Company converted 90,000 tons of quota fertilizers to market-priced sales, earning a price difference of over 14 million yuan. During a county party congress in a certain county in Shaanxi Province last year, each attendee was supplied with 80 kilograms of quota urea, totaling 13.6 tons, which accounted for more than 20% of the county's grain-linked urea.

    Some agricultural materials enterprises violate price policies and raise prices arbitrarily. According to audits in 15 provinces and cities, agricultural materials enterprises sold fertilizers at high prices, illegally earning over 42 million yuan. The Huangpu District Supply and Marketing Cooperative and District Agricultural Materials Company in Guangzhou sold 20 tons of urea that had not been moved from its original location three times, raising the price from over 500 yuan per ton to over 1,000 yuan per ton, earning a profit of over 100,000 yuan.

    In addition, some places have chaotic management of special fertilizers. Nearly 600,000 tons of planned fertilizers in Fujian Province are linked to 58 projects, including tourism, civil affairs, and statistics departments and units, which not only makes it difficult to fulfill the linkage but also allows some units to sell the quotas for profit. In Yiyang County, Jiangxi Province, some grassroots food stations sold over 200 tons of pig-linked fertilizers, accounting for 47% of the allocated quantity, to individual merchants, making it difficult for many farmers to obtain linked fertilizers after selling their pigs.

    Some agricultural materials enterprises also have prominent issues such as withholding, misappropriating, and privately dividing funds. Audits in 380 agricultural materials enterprises in Shandong, Anhui, Hebei, and Heilongjiang provinces found that over 28 million yuan in revenue was withheld. The Ankang Region Agricultural Materials Company in Shaanxi Province illegally extracted nearly 10,000 yuan from the sales of 200 tons of fertilizer, with an average of over 320 yuan per person.

### 对农资行业审计结果表明  化肥农药分配经营中违纪严重

　　对农资行业审计结果表明     
    化肥农药分配经营中违纪严重
    本报讯  记者王锦鹄从审计署获悉，去年以来，各地审计机关开展了对农业生产资料行业的审计，结果表明，部分农资企业在化肥、农药等分配和经营中，违反政策和财经纪律的问题十分严重，仅黑龙江、福建、广东、陕西等１８个省市对３２００多家农资企业和基层供销社审计，就查出违纪金额２．８亿元，其中应上交财政６３００多万元。
    在化肥分配中，层层克扣计划指标的现象相当普遍。福建省审计调查表明，平均每分配百吨化肥指标，经省、地（市）、县、乡、村五级层层克扣，能供给农民的只剩３０多吨。被克扣的平价化肥和指标，大多被农资企业议价销售或批给内部职工和关系户。浙江省农资公司将９万吨平价化肥转为议销，获差价收入１４００多万元。陕西某县去年开党代会，与会人员人均供平价尿素８０公斤，共计１３６吨，占该县粮食挂钩尿素２０％以上。
    一些农资企业违反物价政策，乱涨价。据１５个省市审计查出农资企业高价销售化肥，非法牟利４２００多万元。广州市黄埔区供销社和区农资公司，将原地未动的２０吨尿素倒卖３次，每吨由５００多元抬到１０００多元，牟利１万余元。
    此外，有的地方专项化肥管理混乱。福建省近６０万吨统配化肥，安排与之挂钩的项目达５８种，甚至连旅游、民政、统计等部门、单位也分到专项化肥指标，不但使挂钩难以兑现，有些单位还把指标变卖牟利。江西省弋阳县一些基层食品站，将占分配数量４７％的２００多吨生猪奖售化肥倒卖给个体商贩，使不少农民卖了猪却得不到挂钩化肥。
    一些农资企业截留、挪用、私分资金等违纪问题也比较突出。山东、安徽、河北、黑龙江四省审计的３８０多个农资企业，截留收入达２８００多万元。陕西安康地区农资公司，从２００吨化肥销售款中，非法提取近万元私分，人均３２０多元。
