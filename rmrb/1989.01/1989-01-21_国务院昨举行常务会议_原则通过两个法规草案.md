The State Council held its 32nd executive meeting today, chaired by Premier Li Peng. The meeting discussed and principally approved the draft "Regulations on the Management of Submarine Cable and Pipeline Laying" and the draft "Regulations on the Management of Seeds of the People's Republic of China." After further revisions, these regulations will be issued by the State Council for implementation.

During the discussion, the meeting noted that with the implementation of China's policy of opening up to the outside world and the strategy of developing the coastal economy, the need for laying submarine cables and pipelines between countries, between the mainland and islands, and between different coastal regions will continue to increase. To safeguard China's sovereignty and marine rights and to rationally develop and utilize the ocean, it is necessary to formulate regulations for the management of submarine cable and pipeline laying that are in line with international legal principles.

In discussing the draft "Regulations on the Management of Seeds of the People's Republic of China," the meeting pointed out that seeds are the most basic production materials for agriculture and forestry. With the development of seed commercialization in China, it is urgent to formulate seed management regulations to protect the legitimate rights and interests of seed breeders, producers, operators, and users. It is also necessary to severely crack down on illegal activities such as counterfeiting, passing off inferior products as superior ones, and cheating farmers, to ensure seed quality, and to promote the development of agricultural and forestry production.

Nine members of the State Council's executive meeting attended today's meeting, while five members were absent due to leave.

　　国务院昨举行常务会议  原则通过两个法规草案
    新华社北京１月２０日电  今天举行的国务院第３２次常务会议，在李鹏总理主持下，讨论并原则通过了《铺设海底电缆管道管理规定（草案）》和《中华人民共和国种子管理条例（草案）》，在作进一步修改后由国务院发布施行。
    在讨论中，会议认为随着我国对外开放政策和沿海经济发展战略的实施，为了国际交流和合作以及国际建设的需要，国家之间、国内大陆与海岛之间、沿海不同地区之间铺设的海底电缆和管道将不断增多。从维护我国主权和海洋权益以及合理开发利用海洋出发，制定与国际法原则协调一致的铺设海底电缆管道管理规定，是十分必要的。
    会议在讨论《中华人民共和国种子管理条例（草案）》时指出，种子是农业、林业最基本的生产资料。随着我国种子商品化的发展，亟需制定种子管理法规，以维护种子选育者、生产者、经营者和使用者的合法权益，严厉打击以假乱真、以次充好、坑害农民的违法活动，确保种子质量，促进农业、林业生产的发展。
    出席今天会议的国务院常务会议成员９人，请假的５人。
