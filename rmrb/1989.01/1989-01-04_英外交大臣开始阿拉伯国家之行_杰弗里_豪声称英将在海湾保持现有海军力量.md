British Foreign Secretary Begins Visit to Arab Countries
Geoffrey Howe Says Britain Will Maintain Current Naval Forces in the Gulf

KUWAIT, Jan. 2 (Xinhua) — British Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe said today that Britain will continue to maintain its current naval forces in the Gulf.

He arrived here tonight to begin a 10-day visit to Arab countries, aimed at discussing the Middle East peace process and the Iran-Iraq peace agreement with these countries.

Howe pointed out that the British navy stationed in the Gulf is solely for ensuring the safety and freedom of navigation. As long as there is a need, they will remain there.

He also said that during his visit, he will delve into the commercial relations between Britain and Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and Djibouti.

He said he will discuss with Gulf state officials the recent peace initiative proposed by Palestinian Liberation Organization leader Arafat. He emphasized that the next step depends on Israel.

As one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, Britain is attempting to play a greater role in the Middle East peace process and Gulf peace issues in the coming months.
