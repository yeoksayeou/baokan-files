Recently, we visited Lingjiu Temple, Boshan Temple, Guryan Temple, and Qifengyan Temple in our region and found that these temples have inadequate fire safety measures. Although Lingjiu Temple has six fire extinguishers, their contents have expired. The other temples have no fire-fighting equipment. Most of these temples are located deep in the mountains and forests, with poor transportation and scarce water sources. Additionally, the temples have piles of firewood and straw, which pose a significant fire hazard. If a fire were to occur, these ancient temples would be in grave danger. We urge the relevant departments to strengthen fire safety measures in these ancient temples.

　　上饶地区古寺消防措施不力
    最近，我们走访了我地区灵鹫寺、博山寺、古岩寺、七峰岩寺，发现这些寺庙防火措施不力。灵鹫寺虽有六个灭火器，但药效已经过期，其它寺庙均无消防器材。这些寺庙大多处在深山老林之中，交通不便，缺少水源，且寺内柴草堆积如山，万一发生火灾，古寺将毁于一旦。呼吁有关部门加强古寺的防火工作。
