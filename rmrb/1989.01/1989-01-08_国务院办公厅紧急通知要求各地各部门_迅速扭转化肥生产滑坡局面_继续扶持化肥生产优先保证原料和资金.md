The State Council Office yesterday issued an emergency notice on strengthening fertilizer production, requiring the people's governments of all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government, and all ministries and commissions under the State Council to take effective measures to quickly reverse the declining trend in fertilizer production and ensure the needs of agriculture for fertilizers.

The notice points out that since the fourth quarter of last year, some places have experienced tight supplies of coal and electricity, insufficient transportation capacity, reduced funds, and poor circulation, leading to reduced or halted production in some fertilizer enterprises. This has resulted in a decline in national fertilizer production. All regions and departments must seriously implement the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on Securing a Bumper Harvest in Agriculture Next Year," prioritize the supply of coal, electricity, gas, oil, and phosphate rock and other raw materials needed for fertilizer production, fully utilize fertilizer production capacity, and ensure that enterprises operate at full capacity. In the context of tightening monetary policy, local banks should support the working capital needed by fertilizer production enterprises and the reserve funds needed by the agricultural materials department, and actively help solve problems to ensure normal production of enterprises. The agricultural materials department should promptly purchase fertilizers. If the agricultural materials department indeed lacks funds to purchase fertilizers produced by small fertilizer plants, it should allow small fertilizer plants to sell fertilizers directly to farmers, avoiding the accumulation of products in enterprises and causing reduced or halted production.

The notice emphasizes the need to continue implementing supportive policies for fertilizer production. According to relevant regulations, continue to exempt fertilizer enterprises from the collection of funds for power generation; implement preferential electricity prices for fertilizer production, and this year, continue to exempt small fertilizer enterprises from product taxes.

The notice requires the energy, railway, transportation, and commercial departments to work together and actively cooperate to create good external conditions for fertilizer production, ensuring stable growth in fertilizer production.

The notice also requires that the production of agricultural plastic films and pesticides be supported in accordance with the above spirit.

　　国务院办公厅紧急通知要求各地各部门
    迅速扭转化肥生产滑坡局面
    继续扶持化肥生产优先保证原料和资金
    新华社北京１月７日电  国务院办公厅昨天发出关于抓好化肥生产的紧急通知，要求各省、自治区、直辖市人民政府，国务院各部委采取有力措施，迅速扭转化肥生产滑坡的局面，确保农业用肥的需要。
    通知指出，去年第四季度以来，一些地方由于煤、电供应紧张、运力不足、资金减少和流通不畅等原因，造成部分化肥企业减产或停产，使全国的化肥生产出现了滑坡现象。各地区各部门要认真落实《中共中央、国务院关于夺取明年农业丰收的决定》，优先保证化肥生产所需煤、电、气、油和磷矿石等原料的供应，充分发挥化肥生产能力，使企业满负荷生产，在紧缩银根的情况下，对化肥生产企业所需流动资金和农资部门所需储备资金，各地银行要给予支持，并积极帮助解决，以保证企业正常生产。农业生产资料部门要及时收购化肥，如农资部门确实无资金收购小化肥厂所生产的化肥时，应允许小化肥厂直接把化肥销售给农户，避免生产企业产品涨库、堵库，造成减产或停产。
    通知强调对化肥生产要继续实行扶持政策。按有关规定继续免征化肥企业集资办电费；对化肥生产实行优惠电价，今年，对小化肥企业继续免征产品税。
    通知要求能源、铁路、交通、商业等部门大力协同、积极配合，为化肥生产创造良好的外部条件，确保化肥生产稳定增长。
    通知还要求对农用薄膜、农药的生产，也要参照上述精神予以扶持。
