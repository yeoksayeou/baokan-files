Nationwide Military-Civilian Joint Construction of Spiritual Civilization Becomes More Solid

Strengthens Military-Government-Civilian Relations and Improves Local Social Atmosphere

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 29th – The work of military-civilian joint construction of socialist spiritual civilization in 1988 has become more solid and effective.

According to statistics from the General Political Department's mass work department, there were 32,000 military-civilian joint construction points nationwide last year, a decrease of 20% compared to the previous year and 38% compared to the peak year of 1984.

Appropriately reducing the number and adjusting the layout is to adapt to the situation of the army's streamlining and reorganization, making the joint construction activities more effective. Some units have changed from jointly constructing a road or railway line to conducting joint construction activities with nearby stations; from jointly constructing a street to cooperating with local authorities to build demonstration points. The entire army has adjusted over 3,000 joint construction points far from the barracks to areas near the barracks, changing the previous phenomenon of some units seeking distant and wealthy areas over nearby and poor ones, making the joint construction work more practical.

After the focus of military-civilian joint construction activities shifted to the "doorstep," military-government-civilian relations have been effectively improved, and the social atmosphere in the areas where the troops are stationed has been positively influenced. The Air Force, through strengthening joint construction activities around the airport, has helped local authorities with the construction of "two civilizations," and local governments have also done their best to solve problems for the troops. In the past, civilians would randomly enter the airport, affecting training, but this phenomenon has significantly decreased.

The situation shows that military-civilian joint construction activities have further attracted the attention of party and government leaders at all levels. Some provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have issued special documents to strengthen the leadership of military-civilian joint construction activities. More than 20 major cities nationwide have established military-civilian joint construction guidance committees, and some provinces have established military-civilian joint construction offices in counties with stationed troops to manage and coordinate this work. Last year, seven provinces and cities held military-civilian joint construction theoretical seminars or symposiums. At the spiritual civilization theory discussion meeting held by the Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China, 10 provinces and cities discussed military-civilian joint construction as an important issue. In some places, the phenomenon of local authorities demanding money and materials from the troops has decreased.

### 全国军民共建精神文明活动更扎实  密切军政民关系改善驻地社会风气

　　全国军民共建精神文明活动更扎实
    密切军政民关系改善驻地社会风气
    新华社北京１月２９日电（记者易俭如、通讯员常生荣）１９８８年军民共建社会主义精神文明活动工作更加扎实，收效愈加明显。
    据总政治部群众工作部门统计，去年全国共有军民共建点３．２万多个，比上一年减少２０％，比最多的１９８４年减少３８％。
    适当减少数量，调整布局，是为适应部队精简整编的情况，使共建活动更加讲求实效。一些部队将共建一条公路、铁路线，改为同驻地附近的车站开展共建活动；共建一条街改为协同地方抓好示范点。全军共有３０００多个远离军营的共建点调整到营房附近，改变了以往少数单位存在的舍近求远，嫌贫爱富的现象，使共建工作落到实处。
    军民共建活动重点放到“家门口”以后，有效地改善了军政军民关系，促进了部队驻地社会风气的好转。空军通过加强机场周围的共建活动，帮助地方抓好“两个文明”建设，当地政府也想方设法为部队解决困难。过去群众随意出入机场影响训练，现在这一现象已明显减少。
    情况表明，军民共建活动进一步引起各地党政领导的重视。一些省、市、自治区专门下发文件，加强对军民共建活动的领导。全国有２０多个大城市成立了军民共建指导委员会，有的省凡是有驻军的县都成立了军民共建办公室，主管这项活动的组织和协调。去年，有７个省市召开了军民共建理论研讨会或座谈会。在中共中央宣传部召开的精神文明理论讨论会上，有１０个省市把军民共建作为一个重要问题进行研讨。有些地方向部队要钱要物的现象已经减少。
