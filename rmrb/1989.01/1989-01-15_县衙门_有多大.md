    The county government of H County has a population of over 400,000 and is a mid-sized county in Jilin Province. According to archival records, in 1948 (one year before the liberation of Northeast China), the county had one county committee secretary, two county heads (one principal and one deputy), and 20 county-level departments. Including the 10 district-level party committees and governments, the total number of cadres was 322. By 1955, the county's population had increased from 130,000 in 1948 to 150,000, and the number of county-level departments had increased to 32. Including the 11 districts, the total number of cadres reached 479. However, the number of county-level leading cadres increased by only one deputy secretary.

    Over the course of more than 30 years, the number of departments in H County has grown to 150, and the total number of cadres exceeds 2,000.

    Let's look at F County, located in the Pearl River Delta, which is a wealthy county in Guangdong Province with a population of 724,000. The number of departments in F County has expanded rapidly in the past ten years. In 1987, compared to 1978, the number of departments increased by 40 (from 48 to 88), and the number of cadres increased by nearly 500 (from 936 to 1,430). It is estimated that the number of administrative departments has increased by about four times compared to the early days of liberation, and the total number of cadres has increased by about seven times.

    To maintain the continuously expanding county-level departments, how much money is spent each year? In Jilin Province's H County, in 1987, the administrative expenses allocated by the financial department alone reached 4.086 million yuan, accounting for one-tenth of the financial revenue for that year. The 1988 budget was 3.84 million yuan, but by the end of August, 3.67 million yuan had already been spent. Among these expenses, the cost of county-level meetings alone is 1.5 million yuan per year.

    A member of the H County People's Congress Standing Committee gave the reporter another set of figures:

    Small cars: County-level departments and townships have a total of 95 small cars. The depreciation cost, repair cost, fuel cost, and the salary, bonuses, and travel expenses of the drivers add up to 2.56 million yuan per year. Dining expenses: 1.09 million yuan per year. Construction expenses: an average of 2 million yuan per year. The total of these three expenses is 5.65 million yuan.

    A large and overlapping organizational structure not only leads to excessive expenditure but also results in low work efficiency.

### “县衙门”有多大

　　“县衙门”有多大
    Ｈ县人口４０多万，属吉林省中等县。档案记载的情况是：１９４８年（东北解放早一年），该县有县委书记一人，正副县长二人，县直机构２０个，加上１０个区的党委、政府，干部总数３２２人。１９５５年，全县人口由１９４８年的１３万增至１５万，县直机构增加到３２个。连同１１个区，干部总数达到４７９人。但县一级领导干部只增加了一名副书记。
    历史跨跃３０余年，Ｈ县的机构发展到１５０个，干部总数超过２０００。
    再看地处珠江三角洲的Ｆ县，属广东富县，人口７２．４万，Ｆ县的机构，近十年膨胀速度尤快，１９８７年与１９７８年相比，机构增加４０个，（由４８个增至８８个），干部增加近５００人（由９３６人增至１４３０人）。行政机构与解放初相比估计增长４倍，干部总数则增加７倍左右。
    维持不断膨胀的县级机构，一年要花费多少人民币？吉林省Ｈ县，１９８７年仅财政拨付的行政经费就达４０８．６万元，相当于当年财政收入的１／１０。１９８８年预算３８４万元，但到８月底已支出３６７万元。在这些经费中，仅县一级会议的花销，每年就达１５万元。
    Ｈ县人大常委会的人士则给记者算了另外几笔帐：
    小汽车：县直机关及乡镇共有小汽车９５辆，折旧费加上修理费、油料费和司机的工资、奖金、出车费等，每年需支出２５６万元。吃喝费：每年需１０９万元。建房费：平均每年２００万元。上述三项支出的总和，共计５６５万元。
    机构庞大、重叠，不仅造成经费开支过大，而且带来工作效率低下。
