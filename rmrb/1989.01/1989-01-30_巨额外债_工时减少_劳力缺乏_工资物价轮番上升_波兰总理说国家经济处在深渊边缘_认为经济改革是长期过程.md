Poland's Prime Minister Rakowski said that the Polish economy is "on the brink of the abyss."

According to reports from local newspapers today, at a meeting of the National Council of Trade Unions held on the 27th, Rakowski listed three major "disasters" facing the Polish economy. He first pointed out the heavy burden of massive foreign debt. According to figures released by Poland yesterday, Poland currently owes $38.9 billion to Western countries and 6.8 billion rubles to socialist countries.

He said that Poland is currently unable to repay the principal of its foreign debt, only able to pay the interest each year. In the past six years, the interest paid has already reached $14 billion.

The Polish Prime Minister believes that the reduction in weekly working hours and the lack of labor are another heavy burden on the Polish economy. Currently, Poland still implements a six-day workweek, but due to the state's additional regulation of three Saturdays per month as rest days, it is almost equivalent to a five-day workweek.

Rakowski said that the third major burden is the "mad pressure on wages." He believes that the alternating rises in wages and prices have fallen into a vicious cycle.

When discussing the issue of economic reform, he emphasized that it is not realistic to expect the economic management system that has been in place for 40 years to be completely changed in 10 years, and that patience is necessary. He believes that economic reform will be "a long-term process." He expressed his belief that the Polish people have a strong desire for reform, and as long as they explore and accelerate reform, there is hope to overcome the crisis.

　　巨额外债　工时减少　劳力缺乏　工资物价轮番上升    
    波兰总理说国家经济处在深渊边缘    
    认为经济改革是长期过程
    新华社华沙１月２８日电  波兰总理拉科夫斯基说，波兰经济“处在深渊的边缘”。
    据此间报纸今天报道，在波兰全国职工自治活动家２７日召开的会议上，拉科夫斯基列举了波兰经济面临的三大“灾难”。他首先指出的是，巨大的外债负担。据波兰昨天公布的数字，现在波兰欠西方的外债为３８９亿美元，欠社会主义国家的外债为６８亿卢布。
    他说，波兰现在无力偿还外债的本金，每年只是偿还利息。近６年偿还的利息已达１４０亿美元。
    波兰总理认为，每周工时的减少和缺乏劳力是波兰经济的又一沉重负担。目前波兰仍实行每周６天工作制，由于国家每月额外规定３个星期六为休息日，实际上差不多实行的是每周５天工作制。
    拉科夫斯基说，第三大负担是“对工资的疯狂压力”。他认为，工资和物价的轮番上升已陷入恶性循环。
    他在谈到经济改革问题时强调指出，不能指望４０年形成的经济管理体制会在１０年完全改变，必须要有耐心。他认为，经济改革将是“一个长期过程”。他表示相信，波兰人民有强烈的改革愿望，只要探索和加速改革，有希望摆脱危机。
