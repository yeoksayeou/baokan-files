Title: A British Poet's Dream of Yuan Shangdu

British poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge wrote a well-known poem while under the influence of alcohol or opium, which he did not complete upon waking. The opening lines of the poem mention Yuan Shangdu. The rest of the poem describes his hallucinations, blending Yuan Shangdu with fantastical elements from the Middle East and Africa, as depicted in "A Thousand and One Nights." Without the book at hand, I can only roughly translate the opening lines from memory:

    "Kublai Khan commanded that a stately pleasure-dome be built in Xanadu. / A river ran through it, and it was named Alph. / Through caverns measureless to man / Down to a sunless sea."

Since then, almost every cultured British person knows the name "Shangdu" (Xanadu), which is as famous as the "Silk Road" or "Marco Polo Bridge." One could even say that "Shangdu" has become synonymous with "China." In recent years, we have placed great emphasis on international tourism, and thus have made much of the "Silk Road" and "Marco Polo Bridge." However, we have overlooked Shangdu. The Shangdu ruins still exist and are not far from our capital, with convenient transportation. It would be feasible to restore and utilize them.

The "Cihai" (a Chinese encyclopedic dictionary) describes Shangdu as follows: "In 1256, during the reign of Mongke Khan, Kublai Khan built a city and palace on the north bank of the Luan River. In 1260, he ascended to the throne here and named the place Kaiping Prefecture. In 1264, it was renamed Shangdu. From then on, he frequently visited the place, and throughout the Yuan Dynasty, it was known as one of the two capitals alongside Dadu (Beijing). The scale of Shangdu was larger than the capital of Genghis Khan's time, Karakorum, but smaller than Dadu. The ruins are located on the north bank of the Shanyin River in present-day Zhenglan Banner, Inner Mongolia."

I recall reading a news report from Xinhua News Agency some time ago, stating that the ruins of Yuan Shangdu had recently been discovered, with many remaining artifacts and palace ruins still intact. It seems that restoring and preserving the Shangdu ruins would not be difficult. In recent years, Beijing has shown great interest in preserving and restoring the Old Summer Palace. While the Old Summer Palace represents a shameful period in our history and is useful for patriotic education of the youth, if the goal is to promote tourism, it might be more appropriate to take foreign visitors to Chengde after they have visited the Forbidden City, and then to the Shangdu ruins. Why make foreign visitors visit the Old Summer Palace, causing some of them to recall their ancestors' atrocities and feel embarrassed?

I have not been to Shangdu, so I do not know how much of the Yuan Dynasty ruins are still visible. Yang Yunfu, a Yuan Dynasty poet, wrote "Miscellaneous Poems of Luanjing," which must contain many records of the situation at that time. However, I have not seen these poems. From Coleridge's poem, it seems that near Shangdu there is a great river named "Alph." This must refer to the upper reaches of the Luan River, the Shanyin River. "Shanyin River" is the modern Chinese name, and the original Mongolian name is unknown. Could it have some relation to the English name "Alph"? Western scholars have done much research on "Alph," suggesting that the poet, in his dream, confused this river with the ancient name of the Nile River in Egypt. Perhaps this is true, but it is also possible that "Alph" was the original name of the Luan River or the upper Shanyin River in the Yuan Dynasty. As for the river flowing through countless gorges and finally "flowing into a sunless sea," this means the Luan River flows through the Yan Mountains and eventually into the Bohai Sea. Although the poet had never been to China, he might have had some factual basis from information passed down by others.

### 英国诗人神游元上都

　　英国诗人神游元上都
    杨宪益
    英国十八世纪末著名诗人柯勒瑞吉有一首人所共知的诗篇，那首诗是诗人在酒后，或吸了鸦片烟后，梦中作出的。醒后并没有写完。诗的一开头就提到元代的上都。此后都是描写他的幻觉，把元代上都和近东亚非地区天方夜谭式的想象混在一起。手头没有书，只能凭记忆把诗的开头几句粗译如下：
    “忽必烈汗在上都命令修建／一处豪华的离宫别苑。／圣河阿尔甫在那里奔窜，／经过了峡谷成千上万，／流入不见天日的深渊……”
    自从那时起，差不多有点文化修养的英国人都知道“上都”Ｘａｎａｄｕ这个名字，其知名度可以同“丝绸之路”或“马可波罗桥”媲美，也可以说“上都”几乎已成了“中国”的代名词。我们近几年很重视国际旅游事业，因此在“丝绸之路”或“马可波罗”上大作文章，但是却忽略了上都，其实上都遗址现在还有，而且距离我们的首都不远，交通也不困难，大可以修复利用。
    《辞海》里关于上都是这样说的：“蒙古宪宗六年（１２５６年）忽必烈营建城郭宫室于滦水北。中统元年（１２６０年）即帝位于此，称开平府。四年加号上都，自后岁常‘巡幸’，终元一代与大都并称两都。上都规模大于成吉思汗时期的和林，而小于大都城。故址在今内蒙古正蓝旗东闪电河北岸。”记得前些时候，在报纸上曾有过一段新华社的新闻报导，说元代上都遗址最近已被发现，还有不少残存文物，而且城郭宫苑遗址也还存在。这样看起来，保存修复元上都遗址并不困难。近年来，北京市对保存修复圆明园很感兴趣，其实圆明园只代表我国一段可耻辱的历史，对年轻人进行爱国教育倒是有用的。但如果为了开展旅游事业，似乎在参观故宫以后，带外宾逛逛承德，再看看元上都遗址，要更合适一些，何必要外宾们到圆明园，使他们中有的朋友想到祖先的暴行，感觉脸红呢？
    上都我还没有去过，不知当地的元代遗址还能看到多少。元人杨允孚著有《滦京杂咏》，诗里一定有不少关于当时情况的记载，但是这些诗我也未看过。从柯勒瑞吉的诗来看，在上都附近有一条名叫“阿尔甫”的大河，这当然是指滦河上游的闪电河。“闪电河”是汉译今名，蒙古时代的原名似无从查考了，会不会同英译的阿尔甫河名有些关系呢？西方学者对“阿尔甫”作过不少考证，说是诗人在睡梦中把这条河同埃及的尼罗河古名混在一起了。也许是这样，但也可能“阿尔甫”正是元代滦河或上游闪电河的原名。至于说河水经过无数峡谷，终于“流入不见天日的深渊”，这就是说滦河穿过燕山，终于流入渤海湾了。诗人虽未到过中国，但他从别人传来的消息，可能也有些事实根据。
