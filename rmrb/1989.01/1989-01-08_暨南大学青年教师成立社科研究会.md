More than 80 young teachers from various departments in the humanities at Jinan University in Guangdong recently established a Social Science Research Association to promote teaching and research.

Currently, the spread of the "disdain for learning" trend has had a significant impact on institutions of higher education. Facing this situation, the young teachers at Jinan University felt the limitations of individual efforts and actively organized academic groups. They integrated various disciplines in the humanities, such as literature, history, philosophy, and economics, to pool their strengths, leverage academic advantages, and enhance the academic atmosphere.

Last month, they held their first large-scale academic lecture series. They attempted to explore topics related to current reforms and openings, both directly and indirectly, from new perspectives and with new ideas. These topics included politics, economics, culture, religion, art, aesthetics, and more. Some of the lectures included "Rule by Man and Contemporary Chinese Politics," "The Crisis and Way Out of Contemporary Literature," "Confucian Culture and China's Modernization," "Comparative Enterprise Management," and "Discussing 'The Golden Lotus.'" The lectures had a significant impact both within and outside the university, with nearly 200 people attending each session in a classroom that could accommodate that many.

　　暨南大学青年教师成立社科研究会
    本报讯  广东暨南大学文科各院系的８０多名青年教师，最近成立了社会科学研究会，推动教学和科研。
    当前，“厌学”之风的蔓延，给予高等学府以不小的冲击。面对这一情况，暨大的青年教师们深感个人力量的单薄，便积极组织学术群体，把文科文史哲经各学科交叉起来，集聚力量，发挥学术优势，强化学术空气。
    上个月，他们举办了第一期大型学术讲座，试图用新的观念、从新的角度探讨与当前改革开放有直接或间接关系的政治、经济、文化、宗教、艺术、审美等课题，其中有《人治与当代中国政治》、《当代文学的危机与出路》、《儒家文化与中国的现代化》、《企业管理比较》、《谈谈〈金瓶梅〉》。讲座在校内外影响不小，能容纳２００多人的教室几乎场场爆满。
