Hainan to Attract Large-Scale Foreign Investment

Let Major Conglomerates Undertake Key Projects

	Xinhua News Agency, Haikou: Reporter Luo Zisu reports: As Hainan enters its second year since becoming a province, how will the construction of the Hainan Special Economic Zone proceed? Governor Liang Xiang said to the reporter here: We must leverage Hainan's abundant resources and cheap labor, attract large-scale foreign investment, and develop regional economies in a comprehensive manner through large-scale contracts.

	In 1988, in its first year of establishment, Hainan Province faced droughts, locusts, and strong typhoons, but it achieved initial success in the development of the Special Economic Zone. The province's total industrial and agricultural output value increased by 11.2%, export earnings grew by 1.2 times, the total retail sales of social commodities increased by 22%, and fiscal revenue increased by 40%. By December 31, 1988, the province had approved 2,710 domestic investment enterprises, including 915 joint ventures, 1,795 wholly-owned enterprises, with a total planned investment and registered capital of over 5.9 billion yuan and $72.51 million in foreign exchange. Additionally, the province had approved 446 "three types of capital" enterprises, with a total investment of 749.64 million yuan and $377.25 million in foreign exchange according to the contracts, of which 62% of the yuan and 86% of the foreign exchange came from overseas investments.

	Governor Liang Xiang said: This year, we will focus on attracting major foreign conglomerates to invest in large projects and key engineering projects in Hainan. We will prioritize the development of major construction projects such as airports, highways, ports, and communications. This year, Hainan will successively promulgate a series of regulations, such as the "Company Law," "Foreign Investment Law," "Land Leasing and Transfer Law," and "Environmental Protection Law," to uphold the principle of governance by law.

　　海南将大规模引进外资
    让大财团兴办重点工程
    本报海口电  记者罗自苏报道：进入建省的第二年后，海南特区建设将走怎样的新路？梁湘省长在此间对记者说：要立足于充分利用海南资源丰富、劳力廉价的优势，大规模引进外资，成片承包，综合开发区域经济。
    １９８８年，诞生伊始的海南省经受了旱灾、蝗灾和强台风的袭击，在开发特区建设中初战告捷。全省工农业总产值增产１１．２％，出口创汇增长１．２倍，社会商品零售总额增长２２％，财政收入增长４０％。截至去年１２月３１日止，全省已批准内地投资企业２７１０家，其中内联企业共９１５家，独资企业１７９５家，合同计划投资和注册资金总额人民币５９亿多元，外汇７２５１万美元。另外，全省已发批准证书的“三资”企业共４４６家，按合同规定投资总额人民币７４９６４万元、外汇共３７７２５万美元，其中境外投资的人民币和外汇分别占投资总额的６２％和８６％。
    梁湘省长说：今年要抓紧引进国外大财团来海南兴办大项目和重点工程。对已确定的机场、公路、港口、通讯等重大建设项目要重点开发。今年海南要陆续颁布一批法规，如《公司法》、《外资投资法》、《土地出租、转让法》、《环境保护法》等，坚持以法治省。
