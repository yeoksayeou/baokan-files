Gorbachev Discusses Soviet Foreign and Economic Policy with Western Politicians
Soviet Economy to Integrate with the World Economy

New China News Agency, Moscow, January 18 — According to TASS, Soviet leader Gorbachev today met with a group of Western politicians and expounded on the Soviet Union's foreign policy and considerations for integrating the Soviet economy with the world.

In response to former Japanese Prime Minister Nakasone's question about the difference between the "five principles" guiding Soviet relations with China and the principles guiding relations with European socialist countries, Gorbachev said, "We have seriously exchanged views with the leaders of our friendly countries, summarized many years of cooperation, and confirmed that relations will be built on a friendly basis, on the principles of equality and non-interference in internal affairs. Mutual beneficial cooperation will be developed in a manner that is universally beneficial to socialism and considers the interests of all countries. I think this includes the 'five principles,' but due to the actual relationships formed over decades, it goes beyond the scope of the 'five principles,' of course, without violating any of the aforementioned principles."

Gorbachev pointed out that both capitalism and socialism are changing. Both sides have begun the process of seeking realistic policies. The idea of peaceful coexistence should be viewed from a new angle. Each system can prove its ability to adapt to new realities, and differences can be seen as a driving force for exchange and cooperation. He admitted that the Soviet Union had underestimated the ability of capitalism to adapt and develop under new conditions.

He believes that in the economic aspect of international relations, the mechanism of mutual exchange needs to be internationalized. Without modernizing world economic relations, it is impossible to expect full and healthy international relations. Normal economic relations should be established between capitalist countries and socialist countries, and between developed countries and developing countries.

Gorbachev also discussed the steps to integrate the Soviet economy with the world economy: the Soviet Union will achieve technological progress, modernize the entire technical structure of the industrial base, and change its foreign economic policy on the basis of greater openness and the use of new economic ties. The phenomenon of military production being disconnected from civilian production will be eliminated. In this way, the quality of Soviet products will allow it to solve the problem of the convertibility of the ruble. The Soviet Union will approach this goal in the coming years.

He hopes that the West will respond, adapt to this Soviet partner, and use economic cooperation methods such as direct links between enterprises. He revealed that the Soviet leadership is preparing to make a principled decision on establishing relations with international economic organizations.

　　戈尔巴乔夫同西方政治家谈苏外交经济政策
    苏经济将同世界经济一体化
    新华社莫斯科１月１８日电  据塔斯社报道，苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫今天在会见一批西方政治家时阐述了苏联的对外政策和对苏联经济走向世界的考虑。
    他在回答日本前首相中曾根的苏联同中国关系的“五项原则”与同欧洲社会主义国家关系的原则有何区别的问题时说，“我们同朋友国家的领导人认真地交换了意见，总结了多年的合作，确认关系将建立在友好基础上，建立在平等、不干涉内部事务的原则上，将在普遍有利于社会主义并考虑到各国利益的情况下发展互利合作。我想，这包括了‘五项原则’，但由于几十年来形成的实际关系，又超出了‘五项原则’的范畴，当然，同时又不违背上述原则中的任何一项。”
    戈尔巴乔夫指出，资本主义和社会主义都在变化。双方都开始了探求现实政策的进程。应当从新的角度看待和平共处思想。每个制度都可以证明自己适应新现实的能力，把差异看作是交流和协作的动力。他承认，苏联对资本主义在新条件下适应和发展的能力估计不足。
    他认为，在国际关系的经济方面，需要使相互交往的机制国际化。没有世界经济关系的现代化，就无法指望国际关系的充分健康化。资本主义国家同社会主义国家之间，发达国家同发展中国家之间，都应建立正常的经济关系。
    戈尔巴乔夫还谈到使苏联经济同世界经济“一体化”的步骤：苏联实现科技进步。使工业基础的整个技术结构现代化；在更加开放和利用新的经济联系方式的基础上改变对外经济政策，根除军工生产同民用生产脱节的现象。这样，苏联的商品水平就可以使它解决卢布可兑换的问题。苏联将在近几年内接近这个目标。
    他希望西方予以响应，适应苏联这个伙伴，利用企业之间直接联系等经济合作方式。他透露，苏联领导准备在苏联同国际经济组织建立关系方面作出原则性的决定。
