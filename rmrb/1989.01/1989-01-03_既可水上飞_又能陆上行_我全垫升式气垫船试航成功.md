A hovercraft that can both fly on water and travel on land recently drew the admiration of onlookers as it sailed on the Haihe River in Tianjin. This was the maiden voyage of China's first full-air-cushion hovercraft, marking China's entry into the world's advanced ranks in this field.

The hovercraft was designed by the China State Shipbuilding Corporation and built by the Tianjin Dagang Shipyard. It is powered by two industrial gas turbines produced by the Southern Power Machinery Company of the Aerospace Industry Department, with a total power output of 6,000 horsepower. The hovercraft has a total weight of 73 tons, a load capacity of 12.5 tons, and a maximum speed of over 80 kilometers per hour.

Experts explained that using industrial gas turbines as the power source for a hovercraft is a first in China. Currently, only a few countries in the world possess this technology.

　　既可水上飞　又能陆上行
    我全垫升式气垫船试航成功
    新华社长沙１月２日电  （通讯员吴振根）一艘既可水上飞，又能陆上行的气垫船最近在天津海河航行时，引起了观看者的赞叹。这就是我国第一艘全垫升式气垫船进行的处女航，它的首航成功表明我国在这方面已跻身世界先进行列。
    这艘气垫船船体由中国船舶总公司设计，天津大沽船厂制造，采用航天航空工业部南方动力机械公司生产的两台工业燃气轮机作动力，总功率６０００马力。船体总重７３吨，载重量１２．５吨，最高时速可达８０多公里。
    据专家介绍，用工业燃气轮机作气垫船动力，这在我国还是首创。目前世界上只有少数几个国家掌握这门技术。
