Title: Earth Has At Least Ten Million Species

Currently, biologists generally estimate that the total number of species on Earth is between 1.5 million and 5 million. Professor Mi from Princeton University in the United States has written an article challenging this estimate, suggesting that the number is at least ten million.

Science has confirmed the existence of approximately one million species, with the majority being insects, almost all of which are distributed in temperate regions. Most large land animals are known to humans. The number of large animals in the tropics is roughly two to three times that of temperate regions. The number of insect species in tropical regions is also two to three times that of temperate regions, estimated to be between 1.5 million and 5 million species. However, recent surveys of tropical forests have found that the number of insect species living on a single tree can exceed 1,100. Professor Mi believes that approximately 2% of the insects living on a particular tree are specific to that species. With over 50,000 species of tropical trees, the number of insect species in the tropics alone would not be less than 10 million.

Human investigation of species is far from adequate, and there are certainly many unknown species. If we consider the oceans, the total number of species on Earth would certainly exceed 5 million. The ocean, which covers seven-tenths of the Earth's surface, is still largely unknown to humans. To date, humans have rarely dived below one kilometer, yet the average depth of the ocean is four kilometers. In the vast ocean, there must be many unknown new species. In fact, many species previously thought to be extinct have been discovered recently, such as ancient lizards. Human estimates of the total number of species on Earth need to be revised.

### 地球物种至少在千万以上

　　地球物种至少在千万以上
    目前，生物学家一般估计地球上物种总数约在１５０万至５００万之间。美国普林斯顿大学的米教授撰文提出异议，认为至少也在千万种以上。
    科学已确认生物物种仅约１００万，其中大半属昆虫，几乎都分布在温带地区。陆地上的大型动物基本上都为人所知，热带大型动物种数大致为温带的二至三倍。热带地域的昆虫种数，也是温带区昆虫种数的二至三倍，约１５０万至５００万种。然而，根据最近对热带森林的调查，发现在树木上生活的昆虫种数就超过１１００种。米教授认为，在一种树木上生活的昆虫约有２％属于该种树木特定的昆虫。热带树木种数有５万余种，因此，仅热带昆虫种数就不下１０００万种。
    人对物种的调查是极不充分的，未知生物种类一定还相当多。如果考虑到海洋，地球物种总数就更不会止于５００万。对占地表七成的海洋，人们迄今了解极少。至今，人类还很少深潜到一千米以下的海下，而海洋平均深度却达四千米。在广袤的海洋中一定有许多为人所不知道的新物种。实际上，许多以前被认为已经灭绝了的物种，最近也屡有发现。如古蜥蜴之类。人类对地球物种总数的估计确有修改之必要。
