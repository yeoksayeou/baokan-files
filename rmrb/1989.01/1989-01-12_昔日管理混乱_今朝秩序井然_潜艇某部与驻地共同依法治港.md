The port where a certain submarine unit of the Navy is stationed on Hainan Island is a joint military-civilian port. In the past, some young people from the local area with weak legal awareness often infiltrated the camp area to engage in theft, affecting the unit's training and causing social instability.

This situation caught the attention of the stationed troops, who took it seriously. On one hand, they implemented strict management of the port, and on the other hand, they proactively contacted relevant departments of the local government, often sending personnel to nearby villages to propagate regulations on lawful port management. They also regularly held discussions with local public security departments to study social conditions and analyze potential risks. Additionally, they registered and kept records of over 40 young people from the local area with a history of theft and other misdeeds, providing assistance and education based on individual circumstances, helping the majority to reform and become self-sufficient laborers. Due to the lawful management of the port and appropriate measures, the crime rate at the port where this unit is stationed has dropped to its lowest point in history.

　　昔日管理混乱　今朝秩序井然
    潜艇某部与驻地共同依法治港
    本报讯  海军驻海南岛某潜艇部队所在的港口，是一个军民合用港。过去，驻地少数法制观念淡薄的青年，经常窜入营区从事偷盗活动，影响部队训练，也给社会带来不安定。
    这一现象引起驻军的警觉和重视。他们一方面对港口实行严格管理，一方面主动与当地政府有关部门取得联系，经常派人深入附近村寨向群众宣传依法管理港口的规定，每月都拿出一定时间同地方公安部门一起座谈讨论，研究社情，分析隐患。同时，还把驻地附近的４０多名有偷盗恶习和其他劣迹的青年登记造册，根据不同情况进行帮助教育，使绝大多数人弃旧图新，成为自食其力的劳动者。由于依法治港，措施得当，这个部队所在港口的发案率，已降到有史以来的最低点。
