The Panchen Lama Leaves Beijing for Lhasa to Preside Over the Grand Opening Ceremony of the Rebuilt "Panchen Eastern Tombs"

New China News Agency, Beijing, January 9th: The Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the Honorary President of the Buddhist Association of China, Panchen Erdeni Qoinjye Gyaincain, departed Beijing by special plane today to travel to Lhasa.

This trip to Tibet by the Panchen Lama is to preside over the grand opening ceremony of the rebuilt "Panchen Eastern Tombs" in the Jokhang Temple in Shigatse.

According to reports, the "Panchen Eastern Tombs" are the shrines for the relics of the Fifth to Ninth Panchen Lamas. The original shrines were destroyed during the Cultural Revolution. After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the Party's policies on nationalities, religion, and other aspects were further implemented. The shrines for these Panchen Lamas were rebuilt with funds allocated by the state and partially self-raised by the Jokhang Temple, starting in 1985. The grand opening ceremony for the "Panchen Eastern Tombs" will be held on January 22nd at the Jokhang Temple in Shigatse.

At the airport, the Panchen Lama, dressed in Tibetan robes, accepted an interview from our reporter and said, "The state has allocated a large amount of funds to repair the relic shrines of the Fifth to Ninth Panchen Lamas, which fully demonstrates the correctness and wisdom of the Party's policies on nationalities, religion, and united front work. As the successor of the Panchen Lama, I feel that the opening ceremony has great significance in propagating the Party's policies on nationalities and religion, and in conducting patriotic education for cadres and the masses. This shows the Communist Party's respect for religion and freedom of religious belief."

Secretary of the Central Committee Secretariat and Minister of the United Front Work Department, Yan Mingfu, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, and Ni Zhifu, Secretary of the Tibet Autonomous Region Party Committee, Hu Jintao, Deputy Secretary-General of the State Council, Chang Jie, and others came to the airport to see him off. Hundreds of monks and nuns also came to the airport to see off the Panchen Lama on his journey west.

New China News Agency, Lhasa, January 9th (Our reporter Qunsang, Central People's Broadcasting Station reporter Wangdu): The Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the Honorary President of the Buddhist Association of China, Panchen Erdeni Qoinjye Gyaincain, arrived in Lhasa by special plane today to preside over the grand opening ceremony of the joint relic shrines of the Fifth to Ninth Panchen Lamas.

When the Panchen Vice Chairman, dressed in a yellow silk robe, stepped off the plane, party, government, and military leaders of the Tibet Autonomous Region, including Vice Secretary of the Tibet Autonomous Region Party Committee, Qedhi, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the People's Congress of the Tibet Autonomous Region, Pabala Gelyangjie, and Vice Chairman of the People's Government of the Tibet Autonomous Region, Mao Rupai, as well as the main leaders of the Tibet Autonomous Region Political Consultative Conference, the Buddhist Association, and Lhasa City, presented him with white khatas.

　　班禅大师离京抵拉萨
    主持“班禅东陵札什南捷”重建开光典礼
    新华社北京１月９日电  全国人大常委会副委员长、中国佛教协会名誉会长班禅额尔德尼·确吉坚赞，今天乘专机离开北京前往拉萨。
    班禅大师这次西藏之行，是到日喀则扎什伦布寺主持“班禅东陵札什南捷”重建开光典礼的。
    据介绍，“班禅东陵札什南捷”，是第五世至第九世班禅额尔德尼的遗体灵塔祀殿。这几位班禅大师原来的遗体灵塔祀殿在“文化大革命”中遭到破坏。党的十一届三中全会后，党的民族、宗教政策和其他各项政策得到进一步落实，几位班禅大师的灵塔祀殿由国家拨款、扎什伦布寺自筹部分资金，于１９８５年开始重建。“班禅东陵札什南捷”开光典礼，将于１月２２日在日喀则扎什伦布寺隆重举行。
    在机场，身着藏袍的班禅大师接受本社记者采访时说，国家拨出巨款修复五世至九世班禅灵塔，充分体现了党的民族、宗教、统战政策的正确和英明。作为班禅的继承人，我觉得开光仪式对宣传党的民族宗教政策，对干部群众进行爱国主义教育，有很大的意义，这表现了共产党对宗教和宗教信仰自由的尊重。
    中共中央书记处书记、中央统战部长阎明复，全国人大常委会副委员长阿沛·阿旺晋美、倪志福，中共西藏自治区党委书记胡锦涛，国务院副秘书长常捷等，到机场送行。数百名喇嘛、僧尼也在机场欢送班禅大师西行。
    新华社拉萨１月９日电　（本社记者群桑、中央人民广播电台记者旺堆）前来西藏主持五世至九世班禅合葬灵塔开光典礼的全国人大常委会副委员长、中国佛教协会名誉会长班禅额尔德尼·确吉坚赞，今天乘专机抵达拉萨。
    当身穿米黄色缎子长袍的班禅副委员长走下飞机时，西藏自治区党委副书记热地、自治区人大常委会副主任帕巴拉·格列朗杰、自治区人民政府副主席毛如柏等党政军负责同志和自治区政协、佛协以及拉萨市的主要负责同志，向他献上一条条洁白的哈达。
    今天与班禅同机到达拉萨的还有：中共中央统战部副秘书长李佐民和班禅大师的经师嘉雅活佛以及班禅大师的父母尧西·古公才旦、尧西·索朗卓玛。
