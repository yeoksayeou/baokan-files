A stone thrown into a calm lake causes ripples, and similarly, the publication of an open letter in the People's Daily on October 22 last year, titled "A Judge's Self-Reflection" (an open letter from Li Xiaozhong, President of Fengning Manchu Autonomous County Court, to all staff and officers of the court), stirred up strong reactions in society.

Although some individuals believed that the long-term backlog of civil cases in the courts was nothing new and did not warrant much attention, the majority felt that judicial departments had often been reluctant to acknowledge their own mistakes in the past. Li Xiaozhong's courage to expose the shortcomings and errors in the court's work showed his determination to uphold the law and his sense of responsibility to the people. At a time when rectification and discipline were being emphasized nationwide, why shouldn't the judicial departments conduct a thorough examination of their enforcement practices?

The Xialing Court, mentioned in the letter, took direct responsibility for the backlog of cases. Instead of making excuses, they took the initiative to shoulder their responsibilities. Deputy Director Liu Yanhua said: "In the past, we often blamed the backlog of cases on objective factors such as a lack of personnel and insufficient funds, using these as excuses to forgive ourselves. We talk about public service consciousness and service ideology every day, but if we were the plaintiffs, could we tolerate such delays in case handling by public servants? In the future, we will expedite the resolution of backlogged cases, help the people solve their difficulties, and live up to our sacred duties and the solemn national emblem on our caps..."

New understandings quickly turned into voluntary actions. By mid-November, Fengning County Court had resolved 41 out of the 59 backlogged cases.

Three days after the People's Daily published this open letter, a prisoner named Guo Chengzhong wrote to Li Xiaozhong, the President of Fengning County Court. In his letter, he said: "I read the article 'A Judge's Self-Reflection' in the People's Daily. The sincere emotions in the article deeply moved my heart, awakening my nearly extinguished soul... and strengthened my resolve to become a new person. Therefore, I believe I have no reason not to reform myself well, and even less reason to doubt the policies of our Party and the style of our judicial officers..."

Regarding the reactions sparked by this open letter, Li Xiaozhong, the President of Fengning County Court, said: "Doing one thing well does not mean everything is done well; doing one thing wrong does not mean everything is wrong. We must have self-awareness."

　　一石激起千层浪
    一封公开信发表之后
    去年１０月２２日，《人民日报》发表了《一位法官的自责》（丰宁满族自治县法院院长李晓中致全院干警的公开信）之后，犹如向平静的湖水里投入了一块石子一样，在社会上引起强烈反响。
    虽然也有个别人认为民事案件长期积压，在法院里已司空见惯，没有必要小题大作；但更多的人认为，过去，司法部门往往不愿正视自己的过错。李晓中敢于披露法院工作中的缺点、错误，表明他有依法办事的决心，是对人民负责的表现。在全国各地都在治理、整顿的时候，司法部门为什么不可以对执法情况进行一番认真的检查呢？
    窄岭法庭是信中所述积案的直接责任者。他们没有为自己进行辩解，而是主动承担了应负的责任。副庭长刘延华说：“过去我们对出现积案，总是强调人员少、经费不足等客观原因，以此宽容自己。我们天天在讲公仆意识和服务观念，假如我们自己是当事人，难道能容忍拖延办案的公仆吗？今后，我们要尽快审结积案，为群众排难解忧，以无愧于我们的神圣职责，无愧于帽沿上这颗庄严的国徽……”
    新的认识迅速转变成为自觉的行动。截至１１月中旬，丰宁县法院就将过去积压的５９件案件审结了４１件。
    在《人民日报》发表这封公开信的第三天，一个名叫郭成忠的犯人写信给丰宁县法院院长李晓中。他在信中说：“我读了人民日报《一个法官的自责》一文。文章里真挚的感情深深地打动了我的心，使我这颗近乎泯灭的心灵开始复苏……坚定了重新做人的信心。所以，我认为我没有理由不好好地改造自己，更没有理由去怀疑我们党的政策和我们司法干部的作风……”
    对于这封公开信所引起的反响，丰宁县法院院长李晓中是什么态度呢？他说：“一件事做好了，不等于什么都做好了；一件事做错了，不等于什么都错了。我们要有自知之明。”
