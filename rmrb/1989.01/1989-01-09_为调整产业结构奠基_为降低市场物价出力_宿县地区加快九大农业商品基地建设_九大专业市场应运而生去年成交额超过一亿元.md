For adjusting the industrial structure and laying the foundation, for lowering market prices and making efforts, Su County is accelerating the construction of nine major agricultural commodity bases. Nine major specialized markets have emerged, with last year's transaction volume exceeding one billion yuan.

The secretary of the Su County Regional Committee of the Communist Party of China, Wang Zhaoyao, told the reporter before the Spring Festival: Just shouting about high prices will not bring down the prices. Only by developing commodity production can we effectively lower prices. To this end, they are accelerating the construction of nine major agricultural commodity bases. The main purpose is "to lay the foundation for adjusting the industrial structure and to contribute to lowering market prices."

Su County is located at the southern end of the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain, with abundant agricultural resources. Although there were plans in the past, there was more talk than action. In recent years, they have focused on the development of nine categories of agricultural commodities with large market demand and significant impact on stabilizing and lowering prices, gradually forming a reasonable structure of scale management. These bases are: grains and oils, cotton, fruits, pigs, cattle and sheep, poultry, silkworms and mulberries, tobacco leaves, and tens of thousands of acres of greenhouse vegetables. Last autumn, the grain harvest was hit by a severe drought, but due to increased investment and the role of irrigation and well irrigation, the local officials regarded grain production as the "top priority" and completed the procurement task early. The development of pigs, cattle, and sheep was also relatively rapid, and the prices were relatively stable. Last year, 43,000 acres of greenhouse vegetables also had a bumper harvest, with 160 million kilograms exported. Next year, it can be expanded to 100,000 acres, and exports can increase to 600 million kilograms. Greenhouse vegetables have the effect of "advancing spring, delaying autumn, preventing off-season, and filling gaps," so the prices of fine and coarse vegetables here have always been rising and falling, stabilizing and trending downward.

With the development of production, the market has become more active. Along with the construction of nine major agricultural commodity bases, nine major specialized markets have emerged: Dangshan Greenhouse Vegetable Market, Xiaoxian Longcheng Town Vegetable Wholesale Market, Xiaoxian Qinglongji Cow, Horse, Sheep, Pig, and Fur Market, Dangshan Fruit Market, Su County Fulijie Roasted Chicken Market, Lingbi County Lingcheng Town Chili Market, Sizhou County Guoji Beef Market, Sizhou County Dazhuang Wood Market, and Suzhou City Industrial Products Market. With abundant goods, only high-quality and high-priced items can be sold, and it is difficult for speculators to drive up prices here. The nine markets here have daily transaction volumes ranging from tens of thousands of yuan to hundreds of thousands of yuan, with a total transaction volume of over one billion yuan last year. Customers come from more than 20 provinces and cities across the country and from Hong Kong and Macau. The famous Dangshan pears and Fulijie roasted chickens are also exported to Southeast Asian countries and Hong Kong. With the Spring Festival approaching, these large markets are even more active. People sitting in large offices always worry about prices, but after coming here, they cannot help but gain more confidence that prices this year will be significantly lower than last year.

　　为调整产业结构奠基　为降低市场物价出力
    宿县地区加快九大农业商品基地建设
    九大专业市场应运而生去年成交额超过一亿元
    本报合肥１月８日电  记者张振国报道：中共安徽宿县地委书记王昭耀年前告诉记者：光喊物价贵是喊不出便宜货的。只有发展商品生产才是降低物价的有效途径。为此，他们正在加快九大农业商品基地建设。其目的主要是“为调整产业结构奠基，为降低市场物价出力”。
    宿县地区地处黄淮海平原南端，农业资源十分丰富。过去虽有规划，但喊的多，干成的少。近些年，他们抓住市场需求量大、对稳定和降低物价最有作用的九大类农业商品开发不放，逐步形成了结构合理的规模经营。这些基地是：粮油、棉花、水果、生猪、牛羊、家禽、蚕桑、烟叶以及数万亩大棚蔬菜。去年秋粮遭到特大干旱，但由于增加了投入，发挥了机灌和井灌的作用，全区干部又把粮食生产作为“天字第一号”任务来抓，全年粮食还是获得了丰收，订购任务早已完成。猪、牛、羊发展也较快，价格也比较平稳。去年４．３万亩棚菜也获得丰收，外销了１．６亿公斤。明年可扩建到１０万亩，外销可增加到６亿公斤。棚菜有“春提早，秋延后，防淡季，堵缺口”的作用，所以这里细菜、粗菜价格一直是有升有降，稳中趋降。
    生产发展了，市场也活跃起来。随着九大农业商品基地建设应运而生的已有九大专业市场：砀山大棚菜大市、萧县龙城镇蔬菜批发大市、萧县青龙集牛马羊猪等皮毛大市、砀山水果大市、宿县符离集烧鸡大市、灵璧县灵城镇辣椒大市、泗县郭集牛肉大市、泗县大庄桐木大市、宿州市工业品大市。货多，只能靠优质优价，“倒爷”是很难把这里的物价“倒”上去的。这里的九大市场，日成交额少则几万元，多则几十万元，去年总成交额达１亿多元。顾客来自全国２０多个省市和港澳地区。驰名中外的砀山梨、符离集烧鸡还远销东南亚各国及香港地区。春节将临，这些大市更加活跃。人们坐在大机关里总发愁物价，到此一看，对今年物价要明显低于去年，不能不增加几分信心。
