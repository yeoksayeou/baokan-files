The polar research vessel "Jidihao," which had encountered a massive ice avalanche, successfully navigated through an iceberg gap into open waters at 22:35 Beijing time on January 21, thereby escaping the danger. Faced with the difficulties of anchoring in a hazardous area and unloading supplies for the station, the expedition leaders saw an opportunity when two icebergs, moving at different speeds, created a gap between them. Seizing the moment, they decided to navigate through the gap, and the maneuver was successful. The expedition leaders are now re-planning the unloading of supplies for the station.

　　极地号考察船脱险
    据新华社拉斯曼丘陵１月２１日电（记者张继民）曾遇到特大冰崩的“极地”号科学考察船，北京时间２１日２２时３５分乘机穿过冰山间隙进入宽阔水域，从而脱离了险情。在停泊危险、卸运建站物资又难以进行的情况下，发现两座冰山因移动速度不一、中间出现豁口，考察队领导认为机不可失，时不再来，果断决定乘机穿越，结果一举告成。现考察队领导正重新筹划卸运建站物资事宜。
