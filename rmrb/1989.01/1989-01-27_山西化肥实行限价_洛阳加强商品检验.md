Shanxi Implements Price Controls on Fertilizers; Luoyang Strengthens Commodity Inspection

According to Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, January 26 (Reporter Zhang Wei) The Shanxi Provincial Government recently announced the prices for urea, ammonium nitrate, phosphate fertilizer, and other types of fertilizers that will be seen by farmers. The price for a 40-kilogram bag of urea and ammonium nitrate is 30 yuan and 21.92 yuan respectively, while a 50-kilogram bag of phosphate fertilizer is 14.75 yuan. The prices for various grades of ammonium bicarbonate produced by small fertilizer plants in each county were also announced. Whether sold by specialized departments or directly by factories, and regardless of the number of intermediaries involved, the final price when the fertilizer reaches the farmers must not exceed these prices.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, January 26 (Correspondent Kong Deyi, Reporter Chen Chaozhong) The Standard Metrology Bureau of Luoyang City, Henan Province, has strengthened commodity inspections. Last year, it handled 204 cases of quality and metrology disputes, protecting the interests of the state and consumers.

Last May, a customer bought 16 tons of steel bars in Guanlin Town, but upon reweighing, only 13 tons were found. The bureau's staff immediately found the individual seller of the steel bars and discovered that he had tampered with the scale. The seller was ordered to compensate the customer for the loss. The scale was confiscated, and a fine of 4,000 yuan was imposed.

    新华社郑州１月２６日电　（通讯员孔德义、记者陈朝中）河南省洛阳市标准计量局加强商品检验，去年仲裁质量、计量案件２０４起，维护了国家和消费者利益。
    去年５月，一顾客在关林镇买了１６吨钢筋，经复称只有１３吨。这个局工作人员立即找到了卖钢筋的个体户，发现他在台秤上作了手脚，便令其赔偿顾客的损失。并没收台秤，罚款４０００元。
