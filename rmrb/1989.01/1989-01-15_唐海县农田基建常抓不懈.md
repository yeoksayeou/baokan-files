Tanghai County in Hebei Province, after achieving four consecutive years of bumper harvests, has invested 10 million yuan in agricultural production since last winter, focusing on agricultural water conservancy infrastructure.

Tanghai County utilizes coastal saline-alkali land to plant 270,000 mu (18,000 hectares) of rice. Over the past four years, they have abandoned the mindset of "waiting, relying, and begging" and reformed agricultural infrastructure management methods. They adopted a funding approach of "the county contributes a bit, the collective contributes a bit, and individuals contribute a bit" to solve the funding issues for agricultural infrastructure. Farmers annually pay a reasonable amount of water conservancy fees and labor based on the amount of rice they plant, which is used for dredging agricultural canals. Over the past four years, the county has invested 8 million yuan in agricultural infrastructure, increasing the yield per mu of rice from 479.5 kilograms in 1985 to 540 kilograms in 1988. Since last winter, the Tanghai County Party Committee and government have further summarized the experiences and lessons from agricultural water conservancy construction, clarified the priorities, and widely promoted mechanized construction. The entire county's drainage canals have been dredged using machinery. Farm No. 1 used three large excavators to dredge drainage canals, improving labor efficiency and accelerating the project progress. The entire farm dredged 24 drainage canals, moving 130,000 cubic meters of soil, and improved agricultural production conditions.

　　唐海县农田基建常抓不懈
    本报讯  河北省唐海县，在连续四年夺得农业丰收的基础上，去冬以来，又集资一千万元用于农业生产，搞农田水利基本建设。
    唐海县利用滨海盐碱地种植水稻二十七万亩。四年多来，他们破除“等、靠、要”的思想，改革了农田建设管理方法，采取“县里拨一点、集体拿一点、个人掏一点”的集资办法，解决了农田建设的资金来源。农户每年按种植水稻亩数上交适当、合理的水利费用和建勤工，用于农田渠道的清淤。四年来，全县用于农田建设的投入达八百万元，二十七万亩水稻亩产由一九八五年的四百七十九点五公斤提高到一九八八年的五百四十公斤。去冬以来，唐海县委、县政府进一步总结了农田水利建设的经验教训，明确了重点，并广泛推广机械施工，全县排水渠道清淤实现了机械化。一农场用三台大型挖掘机搞排水渠道清淤，提高了劳动效率，加快了工程进度，全场清理排水渠道二十四条，动土十三万方，改善了农业生产条件。
