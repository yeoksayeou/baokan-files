Iran's official news agency reported today that the main opposition party in Iran, led by former Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan, announced on the 21st that it would participate in the presidential election to be held in August this year.

The report said that the 83-year-old Bazargan stated in a conversation with reporters on the 23rd that his party would nominate a candidate for the election and would apply to the Ministry of the Interior to allow his party to engage in political activities.

Since the Iranian Ministry of the Interior announced last December that it would implement the law allowing opposition parties to operate, which had been suspended due to the Iran-Iraq War, the political atmosphere in Iran has recently improved.

Bazargan's "Freedom Movement" has been criticized by the Iranian government as "liberal," and three of its members are still imprisoned.

    伊朗主要反对党将参加大选
    新华社德黑兰１月２４日电  据伊朗伊斯兰共和国通讯社今天报道，伊朗前总理迈赫迪·巴扎尔甘领导的伊朗主要反对党“自由运动”２１日宣布，将参加今年８月举行的伊朗总统竞选。
    报道说，现年８３岁的巴扎尔甘２３日在对记者的一次谈话中说，他的党将指定一名候选人参加竞选，并将向内政部提出申请，要求允许他的党参加政治活动。
    自伊朗内政部去年１２月宣布，将贯彻执行由于两伊战争而搁置起来的准许反对党活动的法律以来，伊朗的政治气氛最近有所改善。
    巴扎尔甘的“自由运动”曾被伊朗政府谴责为“自由派”，有三名成员仍然被囚禁在狱中。
