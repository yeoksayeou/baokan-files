Reagan's Eight Years in Office: Delivers Farewell Speech
	Pride—Economic and Confidence Revival
	Regret—Massive Deficit Exceeding One Trillion

	BEIJING, Jan. 11 (Xinhua) — U.S. President Ronald Reagan, in his farewell address tonight, said that the "economic revival" and "revival of confidence" are the two greatest achievements he is most proud of during his eight years in office. However, he expressed "regret" over the $1.5 trillion federal deficit accumulated during his term.

	Reagan said that due to the implementation of economic policies centered around tax cuts, the economic growth in the United States since the end of 1982 has been the longest in peacetime history.

	In his 20-minute speech, Reagan praised his "peace through strength" policy. He said that through military buildup, the United States has emerged from years of "weakness and chaos" to become strong, thus able to celebrate "new peace on a global scale" as the new year arrives. He said that not only have the superpowers begun actual reductions in their nuclear arsenals, but conflicts in the Gulf, Afghanistan, Cambodia, and southern Africa have also begun to subside.

	When discussing the improvement of U.S.-Soviet relations, he said that the two countries have had "satisfactory new approaches" in recent years, but the difference from the détente of the 1970s is that this approach is based on "actions rather than words." Reagan hopes that the U.S. and the Soviet Union will "continue to approach each other," saying, "We must remain vigilant, but we must also continue to work together to reduce tensions and mutual suspicion." Reagan also wished for the success of Gorbachev's reform policies.

　　里根执政八年　发表告别演说  
    自豪——经济信心两个复兴
    遗憾——赤字庞大超过万亿
    本报华盛顿１月１１日电  记者仓立德报道：美国总统里根在今晚发表告别讲话时说，美国“经济复兴”和“信心复兴”是他执政８年“最感自豪”的两大成功，但对在他任职期间造成的１．５万亿美元联邦赤字表示“遗憾”。
    里根说，由于实行了以减税为中心的经济政策，美国自１９８２年底以来的经济增长是美国历史上和平时期历时最长的一次。
    在２０分钟的讲话中，里根称赞其“以实力求和平”的政策。他说，由于重整军备，美国从多年的“虚弱和混乱”中变得强大起来，才能在新年到来之际庆祝“全球范围的新的和平”。他说，不仅超级大国已经开始实际削减库存核武器，而且海湾、阿富汗、柬埔寨、南部非洲等地区冲突也开始平息。
    在谈到改善美苏关系时，他说，美苏两国近年来有了“令人满意的新接近”，但与７０年代美苏缓和的区别在于，这一接近的基础“是行动而不是言辞”。里根希望美苏之间“继续接近”，他说，“我们必须保持警惕，但也必须继续共同努力，以减少紧张和相互怀疑”。里根还祝愿戈尔巴乔夫的改革政策获得成功。
