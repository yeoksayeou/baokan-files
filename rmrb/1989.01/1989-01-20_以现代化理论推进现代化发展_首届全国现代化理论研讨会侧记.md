The First National Symposium on Modernization Theory, co-sponsored by the Beijing Society and Science and Technology Development Research Institute and other units, was held in mid-November last year in Beijing. The symposium focused on discussing the following three issues.

		1. The Essence of Modernization

What is the essence of modernization? Some comrades proposed that modernization is industrialization, or at least its main content is industrialization, because the hallmark of underdeveloped countries that are not modernized is the low level of industrial development. Therefore, the main task of modernization is to develop industry, develop the economy, and prioritize "growth first." The majority of comrades believe that modernization is a comprehensive concept that includes not only industrialization and economic development but also changes in politics, society, and culture. Some comrades proposed that modernization and industrialization are two relatively independent historical processes. Industrialization refers to technological and economic changes, that is, replacing manual labor and physical labor with industrial technology and scientific achievements. Modernization refers to social and political changes, such as urbanization and democratization. In Western countries, modernization accompanied industrialization, leading people to view the two as one. However, the internal conditions and external environment faced by modern developing countries are different from those of Western countries in the past, so the processes of modernization and industrialization can be separated. Modernization may precede industrialization or occur after industrialization.

		2. The Relationship Between Modernization and Reform

The delegates generally agreed that modernization and reform are interdependent and complementary, with reform paving the way and creating conditions for modernization, and modernization being the fundamental goal and destination of reform. To correctly handle the relationship between the two, the following three issues need to be paid special attention to at present.

First, deepen the reform of the ownership structure. Some comrades said that in recent years, we have introduced a lot of equipment, technology, and management experience from the West, but in many places, we have not achieved the economic effects that Western countries have. The fundamental reason is that the "wood" being transplanted is different. Therefore, to achieve modernization, we must further transform the economic soil, deepen the reform of the ownership structure, boldly develop various forms of ownership, cultivate a vibrant market mechanism, and expand the ranks of entrepreneurs.

Second, actively promote political democratization. Some comrades proposed that political democratization is an important part of modernization. Building socialist democratic politics and improving democratic institutions is not only an important part of political system reform but also the overall direction and fundamental goal of political system reform. We cannot separate democracy from modernization. Regarding how to achieve democratic politics, there are two different understandings. One opinion is to emphasize majority participation and minority submission to the majority. Another opinion is that merely emphasizing majority participation is not enough because the truth is sometimes in the hands of the minority. What is important is to take measures to prevent the abuse of power and prevent the infringement of citizens' democratic and free rights.

Third, correctly understand and handle the relationship between economic system reform and political system reform. Most comrades believe that both reforms are important driving forces for advancing modernization construction, and they have a close internal connection. However, the two reforms have different scopes, tasks, and goals. We cannot emphasize one reform while neglecting the other, nor can we think that political system reform is merely "coordinating" with economic system reform or that political system reform will be carried out after economic system reform is completed. The development of the situation requires political system reform to catch up quickly.

		3. The Relationship Between Modernization and Cultural Change

Two main issues were discussed. First, why is cultural change important for modernization? There are three understandings: (1) The culture mentioned here is broad in scope, mainly including values, ways of thinking, behavioral patterns, personality, and customs. Modernization includes cultural aspects. China's ancient traditional culture is only suitable for traditional agricultural society and does not meet the needs of modern society. (2) Modernization has two sources: one is self-innovation and development, known as "internal modernization," such as in England, the United States, and France; the other is externally induced, known as "external modernization." Most countries in the world, including China, follow the latter path of modernization. This type of modernization inevitably involves a collision between external and local cultures. Only by paying attention to cultural change can we create a new culture on a new basis. (3) Culture has a relatively independent initiative. In the process of modernization, it is possible to have a "cultural lag" phenomenon, where traditional culture holds back material changes and hinders economic development. It is also possible to have a "cultural leap" phenomenon, where cultural change takes the lead, and new culture leads material changes, promoting faster economic development. Both situations cannot be ignored.

Second, how to understand the relationship between tradition and anti-tradition in culture? There are three viewpoints: (1) The positive function of China's ancient traditional culture for modernization is far less than its negative function, that is, resistance is greater than assistance. In a sense, it should be anti-tradition. But this anti-tradition is not a simple denial but a selective criticism and sublation, making it change in the new situation and create a new culture containing certain traditional elements. (2) Currently, the world's culture is divided into traditional culture, modern culture, and postmodern culture. Many developing countries, including China, face the premature infiltration of postmodern culture, which combines with traditional culture to form a trend of "anti-tradition" settlement, competing with modern new culture. Modern neo-Confucianism has this momentum. (3) Some comrades divide Chinese culture into the "old tradition" of the past two thousand years and the "new tradition" of the thirty years before the reform, believing that the two are basically the same, both being "unified" culture, emphasizing centralized unity, emphasizing unification, and ignoring diversity.

Other comrades believe that the "new tradition" of thirty years is fundamentally different from the "old tradition" of two thousand years. Because there are two new basic factors, one is the economic basis of public ownership, and the other is the ideology of Marxism, leading to a series of differences.

### 以现代化理论推进现代化发展——首届全国现代化理论研讨会侧记

　　以现代化理论推进现代化发展
    ——首届全国现代化理论研讨会侧记
    由北京社会与科技发展研究所等单位联合召开的“首届全国现代化理论研讨会”，于去年１１月中旬在北京举行。会上着重探讨了以下三个方面的问题。
    　　　　一、关于现代化的内涵
    现代化的内涵是什么？有的同志提出，现代化就是工业化，至少其主要内容是工业化，因为不发达国家非现代化的标志，就是工业发展程度不高，所以现代化的主要任务，就是发展工业，发展经济，生产“增长第一”。绝大多数同志认为，现代化是一个全面的综合概念，除了实现工业化，发展经济，还包括着政治、社会和文化诸方面的变迁。还有同志提出，现代化与工业化是两个相对独立的历史进程。工业化是指技术、经济变革，即以工业技术及科学成果取代人的手工操作、体力劳动。现代化是指社会、政治变革，如社会都市化和政治民主化。西方国家现代化是伴随工业化而来的，因而造成人们将二者视为同一。但现代发展中国家所面临的内部条件与外部环境，跟当初西方国家不同，因而现代化和工业化两个进程可以分开，现代化可能先于工业化，也可能出现在工业化之后。
    　　　　二、现代化和改革的关系
    与会代表普遍认为，现代化和改革二者是互为依托，相辅相成的，改革为现代化开辟道路、创造条件，现代化是改革的根本目标和归宿。要正确处理二者的关系，当前要特别注意以下三个问题。
    一是深入进行所有制结构改革。有的同志说，这些年我们从西方引进了不少的设备、技术和管理经验，但在好些地方并没有收到西方国家所具有的经济效果，根本原因是移花接木的“木”不同。因此，我们要实现现代化，就要进一步改造经济土壤，深入进行所有制结构改革，大胆发展多种形式的所有制，培育富有活力的市场机制，扩大企业家阶层的队伍。
    二是积极推进政治民主化。有的同志提出，政治民主化是现代化的一项重要内容。建设社会主义民主政治，完善民主制度，不仅是政治体制改革的重要内容，而且是政治体制改革的总方向和基本目标，我们不能把民主与现代化割裂开来。关于民主政治如何实现？有两种不同的理解，一种意见认为，要重视多数参与，强调少数服从多数。另一种意见认为，仅强调多数参与还不够，因为真理有时在少数人手里，重要的是要采取措施，防止权力的滥用，防止对公民民主与自由权利的侵犯。
    三是正确认识和处理经济体制改革和政治体制改革的关系。大多数同志认为，这两项改革都是推进现代化建设的重要动力，彼此有着密切的内在联系，但两个改革的范畴不同，任务不同，目标不同，不能只强调一个改革而忽视另一个改革，不能认为政治体制改革仅仅是“配合”经济体制改革，或者认为等经济体制改革完成后再搞政治体制改革，形势发展要求政治体制改革要赶快跟上来。
    　　　　三、现代化和文化变革的关系
    主要探讨了两个问题。第一、现代化为什么要重视文化变革？有三种理解：（１）这里说的文化是广义的文化，主要包括价值观念、思维方式、行为模式以及人格和民风等等。现代化包含着文化方面的内容，中国古老的传统文化只适应传统的农业社会，不适应现代化社会运转的需要。（２）现代化从来源上说有两种：一种是自我本土创新、发展而成的，称为“内发型”现代化，如英、美、法等国；一种是外力促逼而生，称为“外发型”现代化。包括中国在内的世界大部分国家，走的是后一种现代化道路。这种现代化必然有外来文化和本土文化的碰撞，只有重视文化变革，才有可能在新的基础上创造出新的文化。（３）文化具有相对独立的能动性，在现代化过程中，既可能出现“文化滞后”现象，由传统文化拖住物质变迁的后腿，妨碍经济发展；又可能出现“文化跃迁”现象，文化变革先行，新的文化趋前发展，带动物质变迁，推动经济更快发展。这两种情况都不能够忽视。
    第二、怎样认识文化上的传统与反传统？有三种观点：（１）中国古老的传统文化对现代化的正面功能远远小于负面功能，即阻力大于助力，在一定意义上应该反传统。但这种反，不是简单地全盘否定，而是有选择地进行批判、扬弃，使之在新的形势下进行变迁，创造出包含着一定传统因素的新文化。（２）目前世界的文化有传统文化、现代文化、后现代文化之分，包括中国在内的许多发展中国家，面临着后现代文化的超前渗入，并与传统文化结合，形成一种清算“反传统”的趋势，与现代新文化相抗衡。现代新儒家学说就有这种来势。（３）部分同志把中国文化分为两千年的“旧传统”和改革前３０年的“新传统”，认为这二者基本上是一致的，都是“大一统”文化，都是强调集中统一，强调一元化，忽视多元化。
    另一些同志认为，３０年的“新传统”在本质上是与两千年的“旧传统”不同的。因为两年有两个新的基本因素，一是以公有制为基础的经济，一是马克思主义的意识形态，从而导致了一系列的差异。
