The U.S. Department of Health released a report on January 11 stating that the deaths and diseases caused by smoking are far more severe than previously imagined. The report says that in 1985, 390,000 people in the United States died from smoking. Among the annual deaths, approximately one in six is related to smoking. Diseases caused by smoking include cancer, heart disease, respiratory diseases, and other conditions such as stomach ulcers. According to a report by the American Cancer Society, women who smoke have a higher risk of developing lung cancer than men. Since 1986, lung cancer has surpassed breast cancer as the leading cause of cancer deaths among women. Additionally, smoking is a significant factor in causing strokes.

Despite the fact that more than 300 cities and counties in the United States have enacted laws and regulations to restrict smoking, there are still over 50 million people who continue to smoke.

　　吸烟危害比想象严重
    本报华盛顿电  记者张启昕报道：美国卫生部一月十一日发表的一份报告称，吸烟造成的死亡和疾病远比以往想象的严重。报告说，一九八五年美国有三十九万人因吸烟而死亡。在每年死亡人数中，大约有六分之一人的死因同吸烟有关。吸烟引起的疾病包括癌症、心脏病、呼吸系统疾病以及诸如胃溃疡等其他疾病。据美国肿瘤协会的研究报告，妇女吸烟得肺癌的危险性高于男子，一九八六年以来肺癌已超过乳房癌，成为危害妇女最大的癌症。其次吸烟也是造成中风的重要病因。
    尽管美国有三百多个市、县通过了限制吸烟的法律和法令，但目前美国仍有五千多万人继续吸烟。
