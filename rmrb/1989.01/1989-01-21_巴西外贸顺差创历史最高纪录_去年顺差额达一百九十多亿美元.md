    Brazil's Trade Surplus Hits Historic High
    Surplus Amount Reaches Over $190 Billion Last Year

    Our reporter Lan Cái Jī in Brasília reports: According to an announcement by the Brazilian Central Bank's Foreign Trade Bureau yesterday, Brazil's trade surplus in 1988 reached $190.89 billion, approximately a 58% increase from the previous year, setting a new historical record. The export trade volume was $337.81 billion, while the import volume was $146.92 billion.

    In terms of the structure of imported and exported goods, the export value of basic industrial products reached $240.82 billion. Among these, automobiles (including parts) and steel products were the leaders, with exports valued at $33 billion and $19 billion respectively. Agricultural products mainly consisted of soybeans and coffee, with exports valued at $23 billion and $21 billion respectively. The primary imported products were oil, valued at $113 billion, followed by wheat, valued at $31 billion.

    It was announced that the trade surplus Brazil achieved last year was mainly used to repay foreign debt interest and principal, thus playing an important role in easing the foreign debt crisis. However, an excessively large trade surplus also exacerbated domestic inflationary pressures. After foreign exchange earnings from export enterprises are remitted to the national treasury, the central bank must issue corresponding local currency to make payments, thereby significantly increasing the money supply and circulation. Last year, Brazil's inflation rate reached 933%, also breaking the historical record.

　　巴西外贸顺差创历史最高纪录    
    去年顺差额达一百九十多亿美元
    本报巴西利亚一月二十日电  记者兰才基报道：据巴西银行外贸局昨天宣布，一九八八年巴西外贸顺差达一百九十点八九亿美元，约比前年增长百分之五十八，破历史上最高纪录，其中出口贸易额为三百三十七点八一亿美元，进口额为一百四十六点九二亿美元。
    在进出口贸易产品结构方面，基础工业产品的出口额达二百四十点八二亿美元，其中汽车（包括零部件）及钢铁产品居于领先地位，分别达三十三亿和十九亿美元，农产品出口以大豆和咖啡为主，分别达二十三亿和二十一亿美元。进口产品主要是石油，达一百一十三亿美元，其次是小麦，达三十一亿美元。
    据宣布，巴西去年获得的外贸顺差，大部分用于偿还外债利率和本金，因此对缓和外债危机起了重要作用。但外贸顺差过大也加剧了国内通货膨胀压力，因为外贸出口企业获得的外汇上缴国库以后，中央银行必须拿出相应的本国货币来支付，从而大大增加了货币发行量和流通量。去年巴西通货膨胀率达百分之九百三十三，也突破了历史最高纪录。
