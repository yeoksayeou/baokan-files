On the evening of January 2, the sports center in the town of Reading, west London, was filled with excitement. Mao Wu Yang, the captain of the Chinese women's volleyball second team, held up the trophy with a smile. The several thousand spectators inside cheered and applauded for the Chinese athletes, who had defeated Peru, Poland, and Czechoslovakia with a 3-0 record, winning the 1989 British International Women's Volleyball Invitational Cup.

After defeating the South American powerhouse Peru on New Year's Day, the Chinese team faced the Polish national team in the afternoon of January 2. The Polish team was ranked fourth in Europe. The young Chinese players coordinated well and won quickly. During the match, player number 2, Wen Qin, successfully executed a single-leg back attack and a quick back attack. Player number 12, Yu Yaqun, was both offensive and defensive, saving 19 balls and scoring 11 points with her serves. Players number 6, He Yunshu, and number 1, Lai Yawen, had powerful serves that effectively disrupted the opponent's first pass. In the second set, the Chinese team fell behind 6-9, and the opponent scored consecutive points. The players' morale fluctuated slightly. The coach promptly adjusted the lineup and stabilized the team. As a result, the team won with scores of 15-8, 15-13, and 15-10.

At 8 PM on January 2, the final between China and Czechoslovakia began. The Czechoslovakian national team was one of the strongest teams in Europe and had won all their matches in this invitational tournament, making them the favorites to win the championship.

At the beginning, the scores were very close. After the first set reached 11-11, the scores started to diverge, and the Chinese team won the first set with a score of 15-12. Thereafter, the Chinese team fought even more fiercely, winning the next two sets with scores of 15-7 and 15-3. Player number 10, Xu Xin, of the Chinese team, excelled in both defense and offense, scoring consecutive points with her spikes. Coach Hu Jin told the reporter that in this match, the players were in high spirits, showcasing their individual strengths. The team's fast and varied plays, defensive counterattacks, and front zone serves were quite successful, effectively suppressing the opponent's attacks.

The tenacious fighting spirit of the Chinese women's volleyball team was widely praised. After the match, the deputy coach of the Peruvian team specially came over to congratulate Xu Xin and her teammates, praising the Chinese team for playing "very well." The Peruvian team coach, Carlos Abalicio, also told the reporter, "Although the Chinese women's volleyball second team is a very young team, it already has considerable strength and a high level of skill, making it a team with great potential for development." The British *Guardian* reported today that the Chinese team has "successful attacks and defenses, and even the Czechoslovakian team, which has strong attacking power, could not break through the Chinese team's strong defense."

　　喜捧冠军杯
    ——中国女排二队闯关纪实
    元月２日晚，伦敦西部城镇雷丁市体育中心内一片欢腾，中国女排二队队长毛武扬脸带微笑高高举起奖杯。场内几千名观众为中国健儿以３∶０战绩连克秘鲁、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克三强，捧走１９８９年英国国际女排邀请赛冠军杯而热烈鼓掌喝采。
    中国女排在元旦战胜南美劲旅秘鲁队之后，２日下午与波兰国家队相遇。波兰队在欧洲名列第四。中国队年轻队员配合默契，以快取胜。比赛中，２号文琴的单脚背飞、背快相当成功。１２号于亚群能攻善守，她一人就救起了１９个球，扣死了１１个球，发球直接得分达１１分之多。６号何云舒和１号赖亚文发球有威力，有效地破坏了对方一传。第二局，中国队曾以６∶９落后，对方扣球连连得分，队员情绪有些波动。教练及时调整阵容，稳住阵脚。结果，以１５∶８、１５∶１３和１５∶１０赢得胜利。
    ２日晚８时，中捷两队决赛开始了。捷克斯洛伐克国家队是欧洲强队之一。在此次邀请赛中连战皆捷，夺冠呼声最高。
    一开始，双方比分咬得很紧，第一局打到１１∶１１后，比分才开始拉开，中国队以１５∶１２拿下第一局。此后，中国队愈战愈勇，接连以１５∶７和１５∶３赢得后两局。中国队１０号许新攻守兼备，发挥得相当出色，扣杀连连得分。中国队教练胡进告诉记者，在这场比赛中，队员精神饱满，发挥出各自的特长，快速多变、防守反击、前区发球均比较成功，有效地抑制了对方的进攻。
    中国女排健儿的顽强战斗精神得到了普遍的赞扬。秘鲁队副教练比赛结束后特地走过来向许新和她的队友们道贺，称赞中国队打得“很出色”。秘鲁队教练卡洛斯·阿巴利西奥也对记者说：“中国女排二队虽然是一支很年轻的球队，但已有相当强的实力和相当高的技术水平，是一支很有发展前途的球队”。英国《卫报》在今天的报道中，称赞中国队有“成功的进攻与防守，即使攻击力较强的捷克斯洛伐克队也未能突破中国队坚强的防线”。
