How to gradually deepen national defense education? Sichuan Province's experience is to widely use mass communication tools and forms to conduct extensive and vivid education.

Since 1986, Sichuan Province has organized a series of activities including the advanced deeds reporting team of the militia for touring reports, the consolation team to visit the troops fighting on the old mountain front, the provincial national defense education experience exchange meeting, and the national defense education theory seminar. The province also formulated and issued the "Sichuan Province National Defense Education Outline."

To deepen national defense education, Sichuan Province, considering the characteristics of the reform of the urban and rural economic system, the large flow of educational objects, and the diversity of ideological and cultural qualities, widely uses mass communication tools and forms to conduct extensive and vivid education. The specific measures are as follows:

Using films, television, radio, newspapers, and other propaganda tools for penetrating education. Provincial, municipal, and prefectural newspapers, radio stations, and television stations have opened national defense education columns or special programs. The province held a national defense education film propaganda month. Some cities and counties also organized national defense education literary works collection activities. Wanzhou City collected lyrics and scores for the "Wanzhou Militia Song" throughout the city and broadcasted and taught them on the radio.

Using correspondence courses and distributing national defense education textbooks for knowledge-based education. Correspondence courses use "Liberation Army Daily," "Chinese Militia," and "Southwest Militia" and other newspapers as basic textbooks to systematically conduct national defense knowledge, national defense spirit, and national defense legal education. At the same time, in addition to formulating a unified education outline, various places also compiled textbooks and materials based on their actual situations. Chengdu Military Sub-district organized the compilation of the "National Defense Education Popular Textbook." Yibin Region organized the compilation of more than 200,000 words of national defense education propaganda materials.

Opening various national defense education venues and organizing various visits and memorial activities to integrate education into various corners of society. More than 2,000 county-level militia training bases in the province have set up "National Defense Education Gardens." Various levels of propaganda departments, military affairs departments, and the Communist Youth League also use National Day, Army Day, annual recruitment, and the reception and placement of retired soldiers as opportunities to educate the masses on national defense concepts.

Sichuan Province's use of mass communication tools and forms to widely and deeply carry out national defense education has shown initial results. The national defense awareness of the province's hundreds of millions of people has been continuously enhanced, and the work of supporting the military and caring for veterans has been increasingly improved, resulting in a "military enlistment fever" and a "supporting the military and caring for veterans fever." In the past two years of recruitment, the number of applicants each year has exceeded one million, which is more than 30 times the recruitment quota. The province's 20 cities, prefectures, and districts, and 161 counties (districts) have established leadership bodies for the development and use of dual-use talents, receiving and placing more than 160,000 transferred officers and retired soldiers. The masses have written more than 500,000 letters and sent more than 545,000 items of various gifts to the soldiers on the plateau, islands, and Yunnan front. At the same time, the province has implemented preferential treatment for 269,000 families of active-duty soldiers with a total of 35.66 million yuan in preferential treatment funds and issued 250,000 yuan in rewards and preferential treatment funds for the families of meritorious soldiers.

　　针对不同教育对象　运用各种宣传工具
    四川广泛进行国防教育
    本报讯  如何把国防教育逐步引向深入？四川省的经验是：广泛运用大众传播工具和形式，进行大覆盖面的形象化教育。
    １９８６年以来，四川省相继组织了民兵先进事迹报告团巡回报告，组织慰问团赴老山前线慰问参战部队，召开了全省国防教育经验交流会和国防教育理论研讨会，制定颁发了《四川省国防教育大纲》。
    为了把国防教育引向深入，四川省根据城乡经济体制改革以后，教育对象流向多、流量大、难集中，以及思想文化素质各异的特点，广泛运用大众传播工具和形式，进行大覆盖面的形象化教育。具体做法是：
    运用电影、电视、广播、报刊等宣传工具，进行渗透性教育。省、地、市、州报刊和电台、电视台都开辟了国防教育专栏或专题节目。全省举办了国防教育电影宣传月活动。一些市县还开展了国防教育文艺作品征集活动。万县市在全市范围内征集《万州民兵歌曲》的歌词和曲谱，并在广播电台播放、教唱。
    运用刊授方式和下发国防教育教材进行知识性教育。刊授以《解放军报》、《中国民兵》、《西南民兵》等报刊为基本教材，系统进行国防知识、国防精神、国防法制等方面的教育。同时，全省除统一制定教育大纲外，各地还结合实际编写了教材和资料。成都军分区组织编写出《国防教育普及课本》。宜宾地区组织编写出２０多万字的国防教育宣传材料。
    开辟各种国防教育场所，组织各种参观纪念活动，把教育融注到社会的多个角落。全省２０００多个县级民兵训练基地先后办起“国防教育园地”。各级宣传、人武部门和共青团组织，还利用国庆节、建军节、年度征兵、接收和安置退伍军人等机会，对群众进行国防观念的教育。
    四川省运用大众传播工具和形式广泛深入地开展国防教育初见成效。全省亿万群众国防观念不断增强，拥军优属工作越做越好，出现了“参军热”、“拥军优属热”。在近两年征兵中，每年应征报名人数都超百万，是征集数的３０多倍。全省２０个市、地、州和１６１个县（区）都建立了开发使用两用人才领导机构，接收安置转业干部和退伍战士１６万多人。广大群众给高原、海岛和云南前线指战员写慰问信５０多万封，寄赠各种慰问品５４．５万件。同时全省落实２６．９万户义务兵家属优待金３５６６万多元，为立功军人家属颁发奖励优待金２５万多元。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（王新权）
