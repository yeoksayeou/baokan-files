The refugee problem that concerns the world

Currently, the total number of refugees worldwide has reached 13 million. In the past 30 years, an average of more than 700 people have fled their homes and become refugees in foreign countries every day. The refugee problem has become an international issue of concern to all.

In Asia, aggressive wars have turned millions of people into refugees. After Vietnam invaded Cambodia, large numbers of Cambodians fled to eastern and northeastern Thailand, becoming miserable refugees. To date, nearly a million refugees are still stranded in refugee camps along the Thai-Cambodian border. With the assistance of the United Nations and relevant countries, about one-third of the Cambodian refugees have settled in third countries, and some young refugees have returned to their homeland. Currently, there are still 300,000 to 400,000 refugees in refugee camps within Thailand.

The Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan at the end of 1979, and nearly one-third of the Afghan people sought refuge in neighboring Pakistan and Iran. Currently, there are 3.2 million Afghan refugees in 251 refugee camps in the North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan alone. Another 2 million Afghan refugees are stranded in Iran. Israel, through several aggressive wars, has annexed Palestine and occupied large tracts of Arab land, driving millions of Arabs, mostly Palestinians, out of their homes. Many Arabs who remain in the Israeli-occupied areas can only live in refugee camps, and some refugees have spent decades in these camps.

In 1988, the number of refugees in Africa increased by 700,000 to 800,000 compared to the previous year, further exacerbating the already severe refugee problem. Due to the conflict between Somalia and Ethiopia, 120,000 Somalis have fled to Ethiopia. The ongoing turmoil in Mozambique has caused many people to flee. Between mid-1987 and mid-1988, 350,000 Mozambicans left their homes seeking refuge in Malawi. To date, more than 600,000 refugees have arrived in Malawi, putting significant pressure on the country's economy. Civil war and natural disasters have caused about 10,000 Sudanese to flee to southwestern Ethiopia each month. By mid-1988, the number of Sudanese refugees stranded in Ethiopia had reached 295,000.

In Latin America, according to statistics from mid-1988, the number of refugees was 310,000. The number of Nicaraguan refugees who fled to Honduras alone increased to 12,900.

The invasion and occupation of other countries are the main causes of the current refugee problem. Therefore, stopping aggression and withdrawing occupying forces from occupied territories is the fundamental measure to solve the refugee problem. With the international situation easing, the momentum for peaceful resolution of regional conflicts is growing. For example, last year's Geneva Agreement on the Afghan issue, the ceasefire agreement between Iran and Iraq, and the agreement between Angola, Cuba, and South Africa have given people a glimmer of hope for solving the refugee problem.

Over the years, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other relevant international organizations have taken measures such as voluntary repatriation, local integration in the first country of refuge, and resettlement to address the refugee problem. The most appropriate way to solve the refugee problem is for refugees to voluntarily, honorably, and safely return to their home countries. In 1987, 11,000 refugees voluntarily returned to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua in Central America, three times the number of voluntary returnees the previous year. In the first half of last year, nearly the same number of refugees returned to these three countries. In 1987, 100,000 Chadian refugees returned from Sudan and the Central African Republic. In the past two years, about 40,000 Ethiopian refugees have returned from neighboring countries. In the past two years, 150,000 refugees have returned to Uganda and more than 30,000 to Mozambique.

As for refugees who cannot voluntarily return to their home countries or integrate locally in the first country of refuge, resettlement becomes a lasting solution. In 1987, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, through procedures such as registration, interviews, and consultations with receiving countries, resettled more than 96,000 refugees. Currently, resettlement in other countries is almost the only way to solve the problem of Indochinese refugees. As of the first half of 1988, the total number of Indochinese refugees in Southeast Asian refugee camps waiting to settle in other countries was as high as 140,000.

The world refugee problem is like a mirror, reflecting various unfortunate events happening in the world today. In 1988, while there were signs of hope in solving the refugee problem, there were also severe challenges. The international community is deeply concerned about this.

　　令人关注的世界难民问题
    刘兆祥
    目前，全世界难民总数已达１３００万。在过去的３０年里，平均每天有７００多人逃离自己的家园而流落异国。难民问题已成为世人关注的国际性问题。
    在亚洲，侵略战争使数以百万计的人沦为难民。越南侵略柬埔寨后，大批柬埔寨人逃入泰国东部和东北部，成为处境悲惨的难民。迄今滞留在泰柬边境难民营的难民接近百万人。在联合国和有关国家的协助下，约１／３的柬埔寨难民已到第三国定居，一些年轻难民返回了祖国，目前在泰国境内难民营中还有三四十万难民。
    苏联１９７９年底入侵阿富汗，近１／３的阿富汗人到邻近的巴基斯坦和伊朗避难。仅在巴基斯坦东北边境省的２５１个难民营里，目前居住着３２０万阿富汗难民。还有２００万阿富汗难民滞留在伊朗。以色列通过数次侵略战争吞并了巴勒斯坦并侵占了阿拉伯国家的大片领土，把数以百万计的阿拉伯人赶出了自己的家园，其中大多数为巴勒斯坦人。留在以色列占领区的不少阿拉伯人只能在难民营中度日，有的难民已在难民营度过了几十个春秋。
    在１９８８年，非洲难民人数比上年增加了７０—８０万，使本已严重的难民问题更成恶化之势。由于索马里和埃塞俄比亚之间的冲突，使１２万索马里人涌入埃塞俄比亚。莫桑比克的持续动乱造成大批人外逃。仅１９８７年年中到１９８８年年中，就有３５万莫桑比克人逃离家园，在马拉维寻求庇护。迄今为止，到达马拉维的难民已达６０多万，他们对马拉维的经济形成了很大的压力。内战和自然灾害使得每个月约有１万苏丹人流入埃塞俄比亚西南部，到１９８８年中期，滞留在埃塞俄比亚的苏丹难民人数已达２９．５万人。
    在拉丁美洲，据１９８８年年中统计，其难民人数为３１万。仅逃到洪都拉斯的尼加拉瓜难民就增至１．２９万人。
    对别国的侵略和占领是当今难民问题产生的主要原因。因此，制止侵略、让侵略军从被占领土撤回是解决难民问题的根本措施。随着国际形势转向缓和，和平解决地区冲突势头日益加强，如去年达成的关于解决阿富汗问题的日内瓦协议、两伊停火协议和安、古、南非三方协议，人们看到了解决难民问题的一线希望。
    多年来，联合国难民署及其他有关国际组织采取自愿遣返、在第一庇护国就地融合和重新安置等方法在解决难民问题上做了大量工作。难民自愿、体面而又安全返回其原籍国，是解决难民问题最妥善的办法。１９８７年，在中美洲，自愿返回萨尔瓦多、危地马拉和尼加拉瓜的难民为１．１万人，是前一年自愿返回人数的３倍。去年上半年，又有几乎相同数目的难民返回这３个国家。１９８７年，从苏丹西部和中非共和国返回的乍得难民达１０万人。近２年，约４万埃塞俄比亚难民从邻国返回家园。在过去２年中，回到乌干达和莫桑比克的难民分别为１５万和３万多人。
    至于就地融合的难民一般都是农民。目前，约有２５％的非洲难民居住在２０年来建立的１４０处有组织的农村定居点。最近，在赞比亚、坦桑尼亚、贝宁、索马里、墨西哥和哥斯达黎加，又增设了一些定居点，以期收容更多的难民。现在，国际机构更加重视对难民的教育、职业培训和帮助其进行商业活动。
    有些难民在第一庇护国不能自愿遣返回国或就地融合，因此，重新安置就成为持久的解决办法。１９８７年，联合国难民署通过登记、面谈、同接受国协商等程序，重新安置了９．６万多难民。目前，到其他国家重新安置几乎是解决印度支那难民的唯一办法。截至１９８８年上半年，在东南亚难民营中等待到其他国家定居的印度支那难民总数高达１４万人。
    世界难民问题如同一面镜子，它反映了当今世界发生的各种不幸事件。在１９８８年，解决难民问题既出现了希望之光，同时也存在严峻的形势，国际社会对此甚为关切。
