Wu Nansong had a daughter, with delicate eyebrows and eyes, very much like his wife who had shared his joys and sorrows. In the cool breeze of June, Wu Nansong named his daughter – Wu Han!

This was in 1980.

However, two years passed, and this little lotus flower still remained silent. Wu Nansong and his wife, anxious and worried, took little Wu Han to every major hospital in the south, but the diagnosis was the same: the injection given at birth was improper, resulting in deafness and mutism.

Looking at his wife crying, Wu Nansong felt guilty towards her and towards this flower of love. But what more could a father do? He was just an honest farmer.

Later, old Wu painfully recalled his feelings at that time, saying, “I wanted to say a few words to my daughter, but if I wrote to her, she wouldn’t understand, wouldn’t that be even more tragic?”

There were very few schools for the deaf and mute in Jiangsu, and even fewer in the rural areas of Jiangbei. Old Wu conducted a survey across the entire county and found that there were more than 300 deaf and mute children still in a state of ignorance. Three hundred little “Wu Hans” were locked in a silent world – his heart ached.

In 1984, he first had the idea of establishing a school for the deaf and mute, which was almost like a pipe dream.

At that time, old Wu even saved the 14 fen of a Harvest brand cigarette. He was the deputy director of the production department and the chief dispatcher of a county-run enterprise in Jingjiang, and he was very skilled at his job. But he quit without a second thought, wanting to establish a school for the deaf and mute. The factory firmly refused to let him go. So, he left all his documents and walked out of the factory gate.

With empty hands and clean sleeves, he had a plan: first establish a factory, then a school, using the factory to support the school. He invited seven relatives from the countryside who were related to him, borrowed 8,000 yuan from the county education bureau, and in January 1985, he started in three old brick houses. These seven men and one woman began to show their skills. The Jingjiang Scientific Instruments Factory thus began.

One must admire Wu Nansong’s foresight. From the beginning, he pursued “new, excellent, and unique” as the principle for running the factory. In four months of hard work, they produced the first domestic flat-view reflection mirror. Wearing it, one could see clearly in front; without turning back, one could also see clearly behind, making it easier for public security officers and security personnel to observe in all directions. The Ministry of Public Security quickly issued a new product recognition certificate.

From then on, they focused on the field of security technology equipment, continuously innovating and launching a series of “new weapons” such as video inspection lamps, anti-theft safety bags, high-intensity self-defense devices, and electronic alarms. In the first year, they achieved a production value of 400,000 yuan and a profit of 50,000 yuan. The “eight immortals” indeed had extraordinary skills.

The factory continued to expand, with more than 300 workers; the production value and profits continued to increase, reaching a production value of over 20 million yuan in 1988, with a net profit of over 2 million yuan. They also established the Suzhou-Jiangsu Public Engineering Industry Co., Ltd. in Hainan. The Jingjiang Scientific Instruments Factory transformed into a “suddenly wealthy” entity in the eyes of people.

Wu Nansong, who was not talkative, had the blueprint of his school in his heart while running the factory, and he certainly did not forget his original intention. On June 1, 1988 – the day when children around the world celebrate Children’s Day, 40 timid deaf and mute children, holding onto their parents’ clothes, walked into the newly built, elegant, and ancient-style gate of the Jingjiang Scientific Instruments Factory. Passing through the moon gate next to the factory building, there was their two-story school building and two rows of student dormitories. Except for the 30 yuan meal fee, the school fees and accommodation fees were free, and they also had a new set of school uniforms. The factory was the strong economic backbone of the school. Thus, the Jingjiang County’s eight-year dual-track school for the deaf and mute was born, and the dream of the madman was realized.

If you stand by the classroom window and listen to the class inside, you will be surprised to find that it is not purely a silent world. The teacher is exaggeratingly opening his mouth to shout while teaching, and the students are also straining their voices to look at the teacher’s mouth movements to learn to speak – most of them are deaf but not mute. Seeing the children’s eager desire to communicate with others, it is truly moving.

Wu Han was also among them. After class, she still sat in her seat, carefully copying the drawings on the blackboard by the teacher. Someone came to look at her, and she pointed to a small fish she had drawn and then pointed to the teacher’s drawing, shyly shaking her hand slightly to indicate that her drawing was not good.

Wu Nansong’s ambition was not yet satisfied. Out of the more than 300 deaf and mute children in the county, only 40 could enter the school. A father of a deaf and mute child – a 40-year-old man – even cried and begged the school to accept his child. He was now negotiating with the county education bureau to decide to move the school for the deaf and mute out of the factory this year, find another 15 mu of land, invest 1 million yuan to build a teaching building, and enroll two classes of 40 students each year, making the school more standardized.

Wu Nansong, dressed in a neat Zhongshan suit, still went to work early and returned late every day, just like when he first started his business. At the factory gate, which he passed every day, there hung two prominent nameplates: one for “Jingjiang Scientific Instruments Factory” and one for “Jingjiang School for the Deaf and Mute.”

　　幼吾幼以及人之幼
    ——靖江农民企业家吴南松办聋哑学校纪事
    本报记者　李泓冰
    吴南松添了一个女儿，细眉细眼，酷肖他那甘苦与共的妻子。嗅着六月里的送爽荷风，吴南松为女儿命名了——吴菡！
    这是１９８０年。
    然而，两年过去，这朵小荷花仍然含笑无语。吴南松和妻子心慌意乱地抱着小吴菡叩开江南所有大医院的门诊室，诊断结果是一致的：新生儿时注射针剂不当，导致聋哑。
    望着哀哀哭泣的妻子，吴南松痛感对不起她，对不起这朵爱情之花。但是，一个爸爸所能做的，他都做过了，他还能做些什么？他不过是一个本份的农民而已。
    后来，老吴痛楚地提起当时的心情，他说：“想跟女儿说几句话都不成，如果我写给她的，她也看不懂，那不是更惨了吗？”
    江苏的聋哑学校寥寥无几，江北农村的聋哑孩子更入学无门。老吴在全县做了调查，一共有３００多个聋哑儿童还处在蒙昧状态。３００多个小“吴菡”被闭锁在无声世界啊——他的心被揪紧了。
    １９８４年，他第一次萌发了办聋哑学校的念头，这几乎近似痴人说梦。
    那时候的老吴，连１角４分的丰收牌香烟也要省着抽。他是靖江一家县办企业的生产科副科长兼总调度长，工作上堪称得心应手。但他一甩手不干了，要办聋哑学校，厂里坚决不放。于是，他留下所有档案关系，扭头出了工厂大门。
    赤手空拳、两袖清风的他肚子里早有了个小九九：先办厂再办校，以厂养校。他延请了七个与他沾亲带故的农村亲戚，跟县文教局借了８０００元钱，在１９８５年元月一头扎进三间旧瓦房里。这七男一女，开始八仙过海、各显神通了。靖江科学器材厂由此拉开序幕。
    不能不佩服吴南松的眼光，打一开始他就把追求“新、优、特”作为办厂宗旨。四个月苦干，他们捧出了国内第一副平视反射镜，戴上它往前看，固然一览无余；不回头往后看，竟也一目了然，使公安干警、治保人员眼观六路、如虎添翼。公安部很快发出了新产品认可证。
    从此，他们瞄准了治安技术器械这一领域，花样翻新地接连推出录像勘察灯、防盗安全包、强光自卫器、电子报警器等一系列“新式武器”。第一年便创产值４０万元，盈利５万元。“八仙”果然身手不凡。
    工厂不断扩大，工人已达３００余；产值利润不断增加，１９８８年产值已经突破２０００万元，纯利超过２００万元。他们又在海南创办了苏琼公共工程实业有限公司。靖江科学器材厂摇身一变，成了人们眼热的“暴发户”。
    不苟言笑的吴南松是把他的学校的蓝图揣在怀里办工厂的，他当然没有忘记初衷。１９８８年６月１日——全世界儿童过节的日子，４０个怯生生的聋哑孩子扯着大人的衣角，走进靖江科学器材厂富丽堂皇、古色古香的新落成的大门。穿过厂房旁的月亮门，那里有他们二层楼的校舍和两排学生宿舍。每个学生除收３０元伙食费外，学费、住宿费分文不取，还有套新校服。工厂就是学校经济上的坚强后盾。于是，靖江县双轨八年制的聋哑学校诞生了，痴人之梦实现了。
    如果你站在教室窗边听里面上课，会不无惊讶地发现，里面并不纯然是个无声世界。老师在夸张地张大嘴巴喊叫着上课，学生也依唔不清地扯着嗓门看着老师口型学说话——他们大部分聋而不哑。看到那些孩子迫切想与人交流的情景，使人好不感动。
    吴菡也坐在他们中间。下课了，她还坐在座位上一丝不苟地照着老师画在黑板上的画儿临摹。有人过来看她，她指指画的一条小鱼儿，又指指老师的画，害羞地轻轻摇了摇手，表示自己画得不好。
    吴南松雄心不已。全县３００多个聋哑儿童，还只有４０人能进学校。一个聋哑儿的爸爸——４０岁的汉子竟哭着求学校收下孩子。他正和县文教局协商，决定今年把聋哑学校迁出工厂，另外找１５亩地皮，投资１００万造一栋教学大楼，以后每年招收两个班４０个学生，使学校日趋正规化。
    穿着一丝不苟的中山装的吴南松，还像刚刚创业时那样，天天早出晚归。在他每天必经的厂门口，悬着两块醒目的门牌：一是“靖江科学器材厂”，一是“靖江聋哑学校”。
