On the desk of Cloth Factory Director Yuan Zhimin in Xiangtan, Hunan Province, I saw a memo from a certain bank: "Director Yuan, we urgently need oil, please arrange for it." I was puzzled. The factory only produces polyester filament, so where would the oil come from?

Director Yuan sighed and shook his hands vigorously, lowering his voice: "Don't ask, just hurry up. It's no problem to get some oil, just tighten our belts a bit, and we'll manage."

"But isn't oil allocated according to a plan?" I still didn't catch on.

He hesitated, stammered, and after a long while, managed to say: "They've done us a big favor, they're like the god of wealth." In other words, "the god of wealth" is not someone you can offend.

Soon, Director Yuan sighed deeply and said regretfully: "Although the contract system gives the factory director the power to decide everything, and the contracts have been signed, everything must be done according to the contract, it's very strict. But it's too hard, I can't do as I please, and there are some things I can't decide."

This reminded me of another factory director who said: "Nowadays, I can't speak or act when I see a memo!"

Director Yuan took out a thick stack of memos from his drawer, some wide, some narrow, some long, some short, and handed them to me. He repeatedly warned: "You're doing a good deed, please, please don't reveal this. If you do, you can just walk away, but I'll be in a difficult position. Losing my job as director is a small matter, but the factory might go downhill." I reassured him while carefully looking through the memos. It was truly an eye-opener, broadening my horizons. It turns out that the content of these memos is enough to be considered a subject of study.

These numerous memos can be roughly divided into several categories: First, requests for products, vehicles, oil, etc.; second, requests to place people, either for relatives or friends, or to get a good job, good workshop, or good teacher; third, requests to help with job transfers; fourth, interference in the factory's production and management; fifth, extortion or fundraising, donations, begging. The authors of these memos are mostly the director's superiors, old leaders, old friends, relatives, colleagues, comrades-in-arms, etc. With a wave of their pen, a piece of paper lands in the director's hands, and who knows how much time and effort the directors have to spend on these!

I wonder if all these people who write memos have ever put themselves in the directors' shoes?

I think: these memos are a symbol of power, but they are not a manifestation of legal power; they are a kind of superior consciousness imposed on others. Some memos are materials for weaving "relationship networks," used as a "medium" to achieve personal goals without exposing oneself. Some memos blatantly reflect the dirt in some people's hearts. In short, they are a genuine social nuisance.

Comrades who write memos for personal matters, stop!

### 厂长收到的“条子”

　　厂长收到的“条子”
    邓立品
    在湖南省湘潭市化纤厂厂长袁志明的办公桌上，笔者看到一张某银行写给他的便条：“袁厂长，我们需油急用，请予解决。”我心里很纳闷，化纤厂只生产涤纶长丝，哪有油供应呢？
    袁厂长苦笑着双手齐摇，声音也降低了八度：“快些莫问，要点油没关系，自己紧一点，也要给解决。”
    “油不是有计划供应的吗？”我还不知趣。
    他欲言又止，吞吞吐吐，好半天才憋出几句话来：“他们帮了我们的大忙，财神菩萨呀。”言下之意，“财神菩萨”是得罪不起的。
    俄顷，袁厂长长长地叹了口气，不无遗憾地说：“虽说承包厂长有权决定一切，合同也签了，一切要按合同办事，硬得很。但太难了，由不得我，我也有些事作不了主。”这使我想起另一位厂长说的：“如今我见了条子开不得口又做不得声！”
    袁厂长从抽屉里翻出厚厚一叠来自四面八方的宽的、窄的、长的、短的“条子”递给我，一边千叮咛万嘱咐：“你做好事，千千万万拜托你，切莫捅出去。你若捅出去了，你一拍屁股走了，我就下不得台。厂长当不成事小，厂子只怕会走下坡路。”我一边安慰他，一边过细地把“条子”看了一遍，真是眼界大开，增长了不少见识，原来这“条子”里面的文章，够得上一门“学问”呢。
    这众多的“条子”，大约有这样几大类：一是要产品、要车、要油等；二是要安插人，有为亲属说话的，有为朋友出力的，还有要个好工种、好车间、好师傅；三是请照顾调动工作的；四是干预厂里生产经营的；五是敲竹杠或搞摊派、资助、化缘的。“条子”的作者，不外厂长的顶头上司、老领导、老朋友、亲戚、同事、战友等。他们大笔一挥，一片纸落在厂长手里，掂掂份量，不知该要付出厂长们多少时间和心血！我不知道这么多写“条子”的人设身处地为厂长们想过没有？
    笔者想：这些条子，有的是权力的象征，但它并非合法权力的体现，而是一种强加于人的长官意识；有些“条子”是编织“关系网”的原料，为达个人某种目的便通过它来作“媒介”，自己不抛头露面；有的“条子”则赤裸裸地反映了某些人心灵上的污垢。一句话，它是一种货真价实的社会公害。
    为私事写“条子”的同志，住手！
