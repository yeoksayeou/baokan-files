	Bazhong Canned Food Factory invests in agricultural base
	Export earnings of $13 million in 1988, winning three national gold awards

	People's Daily reports: The Bazhong Canned Food Factory in Sichuan Province treats its raw material base as the first workshop of the enterprise, actively investing in and supporting agriculture. In 15 counties (cities) among 120,000-plus farming households, a solid raw material base has been established, ensuring the supply of raw materials for exported canned goods and significantly enhancing the enterprise's export earnings. In 1988, the factory earned $13 million from exports and won three gold awards from the Ministry of Light Industry, the State Science and Technology Commission, and other units, including the "Idealistic and Contributing Advanced Enterprise," "Golden Dragon Soaring," and "Star Spark Plan Achievement."

	The main raw materials for producing canned foods come from rural areas. To build a good base, the factory ensures "six guarantees": guaranteeing the selection and updating of superior varieties; guaranteeing technical guidance and training; guaranteeing the supply of fertilizers and pesticides; guaranteeing the purchase of all qualified raw materials; guaranteeing that the price of raw materials is higher than the market price; guaranteeing farmers' income, not reducing grades or prices, and helping farmers solve production funding issues. In recent years, they have allocated over 2.5 million yuan, mobilizing more than 120 agricultural technicians to frequently go to rural areas to teach techniques and guide production. They provide farmers with an average of 26 million yuan in low-interest or interest-free loans each year to develop the raw material base, supplying farmers with high-quality, reasonably priced fertilizers and pesticides totaling over 5,000 tons. For varieties with long production cycles, slow results, and high investment, they provide farmers with subsidies totaling over 2.1 million yuan before production. Last year, due to seed variation, the green bean crop planted by farmers experienced a reduction in yield. The factory actively compensated farmers with 5.7 million yuan in loss funds. They also adjust the raw material purchase price according to market conditions in a timely manner, ensuring that farmers do not suffer losses. In 1987 and 1988 alone, they gave back over 33 million yuan to farmers.

	Through these effective agricultural support and assistance measures, the factory has now established 330 orchards of peaches, kiwifruit, and seedless citrus, covering an area of 11,500 mu, and developed 19,500 mu of asparagus, tomatoes, and green beans, and over 10 million square meters of shiitake mushrooms. The raw material base provides the factory with nearly 20,000 tons of various canned food raw materials annually, ensuring the factory's raw material needs.

　　巴中罐头食品厂投资建农业基地    
    去年出口创汇１３００万美元荣获国家三个金奖
    本报讯  四川巴中罐头食品厂把原料基地作为企业第一车间来抓，主动投资扶持农业，在１５个县（市）的１２万多农户中建立了牢固的原料基地，确保了出口罐头原料的需要，大大提高了企业出口创汇能力，去年出口创汇１３００万美元，荣获了轻工业部、国家科委等单位颁发的“讲理想比贡献先进企业”、“金龙腾飞”、“星火计划成果”等３个金奖。
    生产罐头食品的主要原料来源于农村，这个厂为搞好基地建设，坚持做到“六个保证”：保证选育、更新优良品种；保证技术指导和技术培训；保证化肥农药供给；保证全部收购合格原料；保证原料价格高于市场价格；保证农民收入、不压级压价，并协助农民解决生产资金。近年来，他们累计拿出２５０多万元，集结１２０多名农业技术员常年到农村传授技术，指导生产。他们以贴息或低息贷款方式，给农户提供年均２６０万元左右的资金，用以发展原料基地，供给农民优质平价化肥、农药５０００余吨。对那些生产周期长、见效慢、投资大的品种，他们在生产前期给予农民无偿补贴达２１０多万元。去年，农民种植的青刀豆因种子发生变异减产，该厂主动给农民补贴损失款５７万元。他们还根据市场行情，适时提高原料收购价格，不让农民吃亏，仅１９８７、１９８８年就向农民让利３３０多万元。
    通过这些行之有效的支农、扶农措施，这个厂如今在农村建立了黄桃、猕猴桃、无核桔果园３３０个，面积达１１５００亩，发展芦笋、蕃茄、青刀豆等种植面积１９５００亩，磨菇１０００多万平方米。原料基地平均每年为厂里提供各种罐头原料近２万吨，确保了工厂原料的需要。　　　　（肖健、杨贵华）
