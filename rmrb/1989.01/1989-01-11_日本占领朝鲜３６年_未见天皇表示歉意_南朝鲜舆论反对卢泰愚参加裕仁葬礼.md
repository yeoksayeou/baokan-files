Japan occupied Korea for 36 years, and there has been no apology from the Emperor. South Korean public opinion opposes President Roh Tae-woo attending Emperor Hirohito's funeral.

New York, January 10th: South Korean public opinion believes that the late Japanese Emperor Hirohito bears the main responsibility for Japan's brutal trampling and massacre of the Korean people during World War II, and firmly opposes South Korean President Roh Tae-woo attending Hirohito's funeral.

According to reports, many South Koreans have expressed that in the past, Japan occupied Korea for 36 years, causing the Korean people to suffer greatly. After Japan's defeat, it not only did not apologize to the Korean people, but not even a word of apology was uttered. They expressed great dissatisfaction with this.

The Seoul Broadcasting Station today issued a commentary saying that South Korean people do not want to mourn Hirohito's death, because he did not make amends for his historical mistakes during his lifetime.

Another report states that a South Korean official said on the 9th that Roh Tae-woo will visit Japan in early March this year to discuss relations between the new governments of South Korea, Japan, and the United States.

　　日本占领朝鲜３６年　未见天皇表示歉意
    南朝鲜舆论反对卢泰愚参加裕仁葬礼
    新华社平壤１月１０日电  汉城消息：南朝鲜舆论界认为，日本已故天皇裕仁对日本在第二次世界大战中残酷蹂躏和屠杀朝鲜人民负有主要责任，并坚决反对南朝鲜总统卢泰愚参加裕仁的葬礼。
    据报道，南朝鲜许多人表示，过去，日本强占朝鲜达３６年之久，使朝鲜人民饱尝了痛苦。日本战败后，它不但不向朝鲜人民道歉，连一句表示歉意的话都没有。他们对此表示极大的不满。
    汉城广播电台今天发表评论说，南朝鲜人民不愿对裕仁去世表示哀悼，因为他在生前没有了结他在历史上所犯的过错。
    另据报道，南朝鲜当局的一位官员９日说，卢泰愚将于今年３月上旬访问日本，以讨论南朝鲜、日本、美国新政府之间的关系。
