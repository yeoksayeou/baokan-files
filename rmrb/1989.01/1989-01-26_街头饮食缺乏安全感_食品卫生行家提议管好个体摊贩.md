As roasted mutton skewers, Tianjin fried pancakes, and other street foods become ubiquitous in the streets and alleys of major cities like Beijing, strengthening the management of these types of foods has become a significant issue affecting the health of millions of people.

On January 20, the national conference of directors of food hygiene supervision and inspection institutes, which concluded in Guangzhou, pointed out that as a "new force," street food has become a necessary supplement to the catering industry, playing a certain role in meeting the needs of people's lives and the tourism industry. However, the lack of safety in street food has already caused concern among various sectors of society and foreign tourists. According to national food poisoning statistics for 1986 and 1987, the rate of food poisoning and death from consuming foods sold by individual vendors is far higher than that in collective canteens and public catering services. Taking 1987 as an example, the combined food poisoning and death rate for collective canteens and public catering services was 0.14%, while for individual vendors it was 30%. The Tianjin Municipal Food Hygiene Supervision and Inspection Institute reported that in 1987, 64% of food poisoning cases in the city were from street food and market trade.

The conference noted that in many cities, individual food vendors now account for more than half of all food production and sales units. Some individual vendors, especially those operating without a license, do not have health certificates, pay no attention to personal hygiene or food hygiene during production and sales, do not thoroughly disinfect utensils, do not separate funds from goods, and lack facilities for dust and fly control.

For this reason, food hygiene experts and supervision and inspection personnel from across the country proposed that street food should transition from being scattered to centralized. They believe that ensuring water and electricity supply, utensil disinfection, food preservation, and raw material control are key measures to guarantee the safety of these types of food.

　　街头饮食缺乏安全感    
    食品卫生行家提议管好个体摊贩
    本报讯  当烤羊肉串、天津煎饼等街头食品遍及北京等大城市的街头巷尾之时，加强对这类食品的管理，就成为关系亿万群众身体健康的大问题。
    １月２０日在广州闭幕的全国食品卫生监督检验所所长会议指出，作为一支“新军”，街头食品已成为饮食业的必要补充，它对满足人民生活和旅游事业的需求起了一定作用。但是，街头食品缺乏安全感，目前已引起社会各界及国外游客的担忧。据１９８６、１９８７年全国食物中毒统计，因食用个体摊贩制售的食品引起的食物中毒病死率，远远高于集体食堂和公共饮食业。以１９８７年为例，集体食堂和公共饮食业的食物中毒病死率共计为０．１４％，个体摊贩为３０％。天津市食品卫生监督检验所报告，１９８７年，该市食物中毒，有６４％来自街头食品和集市贸易。
    会议指出，目前不少城市的饮食个体户已占整个食品生产、经营单位的半数以上。有些个体摊贩，特别是无照营业者既没有健康体检证，也不注意个人卫生和制售环节中的食品卫生，餐具消毒不彻底，货款不分，并缺少防尘、防蝇等设施。
    为此，来自全国的食品卫生专家及监督检验人员提出，要使街头食品由分散走向集中。他们认为，保障供水供电、餐具消毒、食物保鲜和原料控制，是保证这类食品安全的关键性措施。
