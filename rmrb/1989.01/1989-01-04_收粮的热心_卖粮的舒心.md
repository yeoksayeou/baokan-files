The grain and oil procurement center in Chengguan Town, Chahar Right Wing Middle Banner, Inner Mongolia, is responsible for the procurement of grain and oil from over 50,000 households in three townships. During the 1988 autumn grain procurement, they worked hard to improve the grain and oil procurement methods, simplify the grain selling procedures, and shorten the waiting time for farmers to sell their grain. Their specific practices are as follows:

Firstly, farmers selling grain receive a sequence number and proceed in order for quality inspection and weighing, eliminating the past issues of long queues, cutting in line, and endless arguments. Secondly, the grain depot assigns specific personnel to directly transmit the filled-out cards with details of variety, quantity, grade, and price to the financial office. After issuing and verifying the tickets, payment is made in full. The grain procurement tickets do not pass through the farmers' hands, preventing past issues of loss, alteration, and accounting errors, and solving the problem of mistakenly receiving someone else's grain payment. Thirdly, they strengthen quality service, accepting grain without rejection, quantity limits, or price suppression. Farmers selling grain at this depot only need about 20 minutes to complete the transaction.

　　收粮的热心　卖粮的舒心
    内蒙古察哈尔右翼中旗城关粮库担负着３个乡５万多农户的粮油收购任务。在１９８８年秋粮收购中，他们努力改进粮油收购办法，简化收粮手续，缩短了农民卖粮等候的时间。他们的具体做法是：
    首先，农民卖粮先领取顺序号，按号依次验质、过秤，改变了过去售粮排长队，互相插行，争吵不休的弊端。其次，粮库确定专人将填写好的品种、数量、等级和价格的卡片直接传送到财务室，开票、复核后如数付款。购粮传票不经农民之手，既防止了过去丢失、涂改、错帐等现象的发生，又解决了张冠李戴错领他人粮款的问题。第三，强化优质服务，农民交粮不拒收、不限量、不压价。农民来这个粮库卖粮，只需要约２０分钟就可以办完事。
