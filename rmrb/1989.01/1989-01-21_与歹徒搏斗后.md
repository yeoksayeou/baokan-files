On November 30, 1988, Colonel Sun Yunhua, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Air Force Aviation Corps, was waiting at the Xuzhou Railway Station. At 18:40, he went to the restroom. As soon as he entered, he saw a criminal holding two knives committing a crime. Sun Yunhua rushed forward to grab the criminal and wrestle the knife from his hand. During the struggle, Sun Yunhua was stabbed seven times on his face, neck, and palms, and blood was flowing profusely. The criminal fled in a panic after committing the crime.

While reporting the incident, Sun Yunhua, due to excessive blood loss, gradually lost consciousness. At this time, Cai Jingshui, a private taxi driver from Shizi Mountain Village, Shizi Mountain Township, Xuzhou suburbs, drove by and saw the situation. He stopped the car. Sun Yunhua said to him, "The criminal stabbed me. Please take me to the hospital quickly." Without saying a word, Cai Jingshui immediately helped him into the car, and the car rushed to the First People's Hospital of Xuzhou. After arriving at the hospital, Cai Jingshui did not ask Sun Yunhua for the fare and even took out money to register for Sun Yunhua. Cai Jingshui learned that Sun Yunhua had not yet reported the case, so he let his assistant stay to take care of Sun, and he himself drove to the railway station police station to report the case. Then he rushed back to the hospital to take care of Sun Yunhua. Cai Jingshui continued to help until 21:00 before quietly leaving.

After being sent to the First People's Hospital of Xuzhou, doctors and nurses from the ENT department, orthopedics department, and other departments performed emergency surgery on Sun Yunhua, quickly saving his life.

The next day, the party and government leaders of Xuzhou City visited Sun Yunhua in the hospital with gifts and decided to commend him.

The criminal who wielded the knife at the Xuzhou Railway Station was found to have committed suicide while being pursued by the police. It was later discovered that he was a fugitive from another province.

　　与歹徒搏斗后
    １９８８年１１月３０日，空军航空兵某师上校副参谋长孙运华在徐州火车站候车。１８时４０分，他去厕所，刚进门就见一歹徒手持双刀正在行凶。孙运华上前抱住歹徒，并夺他手中的刀。搏斗中，孙运华的脸、颈、手掌等处被捅７刀，血流不止。这名歹徒作案后，慌忙逃窜。
    在报案途中，孙运华由于流血过多，渐渐支持不住。这时，徐州郊区狮子山乡狮子山村个体出租汽车司机蔡敬水开车路过，见此情景，停下车来。孙运华对他说：“坏人把我刺伤了，请快送我去医院。”蔡敬水二话没说，立刻把他扶上车，汽车立即向徐州市第一人民医院驶去。车到医院后，蔡敬水不但没向孙运华要车费，还主动掏钱为孙运华挂了号。蔡敬水得知孙运华还未报案，便让助手留下照顾孙，自己开车到车站派出所报了案，然后赶回医院照看孙运华，蔡敬水一直忙到晚上２１时才悄悄离去。
    孙运华被送进徐州市第一人民医院后，五官科、骨科等科的医护人员对他进行紧急手术，使他很快脱离了危险。
    第二天，徐州市党政领导人带着慰问品到医院看望了孙运华，并决定对他进行表彰。
    在徐州火车站持刀行凶的那名歹徒，在公安人员的围捕中已畏罪自杀。经查，是外地一名流窜人员。
