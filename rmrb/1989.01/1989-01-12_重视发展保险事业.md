The development of the insurance industry, guiding people to reasonably arrange production and life, is of great significance to the current efforts to rectify the economic environment and curb the expansion of consumption demand.

In recent years, with the continuous development of the commodity economy, the insurance industry has become an indispensable part of China's social and economic life. Especially in the Great Khingan Range forest fire, the floods in Zhejiang, and the earthquake in Yunnan, the economic compensation role of insurance has become increasingly prominent. In some places, many leading cadres have begun to pay attention to insurance work; more and more people are also gradually willing to spend money on insurance. However, from the perspective of the whole society, people's insurance awareness is still weak. Many people prefer to compete with each other or purchase high-end consumer goods, or indulge in feasting and banqueting, and even burn incense and worship Buddha, but are not willing to spend a small amount of money to buy insurance. This consumption pattern not only exacerbates the shortage of market resources and the high price level but also is not conducive to the stability and development of the economy. To change this situation, it is necessary to broaden the narrow consumption field in the past and guide people to extend their consumption vision from eating, drinking, wearing, and using to participating in insurance, investing in stocks, bonds, and purchasing housing.

Currently, among China's 1 billion people, only 70 million have insured various types of personal insurance, and only 57 million households have insured family property. The average personal insurance premium payment is less than 2 yuan. This indicates that China's insurance market has enormous potential, and the proportion of insurance premiums to total consumption expenditures is very small. As living standards improve year by year, most people are fully capable of participating in insurance to eliminate worries in production and life, rather than always relying on the state for "relief" and "subsidies" in the form of a "big pot" meal. On the other hand, insurance companies pool the premium income, use part of it for compensation, and invest the rest as credit funds in production and construction. The approach of the Qingdao Insurance Company to combine the development of the insurance industry with the optimization of fund allocation is quite commendable.

### 重视发展保险事业

　　重视发展保险事业
    发展保险事业，引导人们合理安排生产和生活，对于当前治理经济环境，抑制消费需求膨胀，具有重要意义。
    近年来，随着商品经济的持续发展，保险事业已成为我国社会经济生活中必不可少的一部分。特别是在大兴安岭森林火灾、浙江洪涝、云南地震等抢险救灾之中，保险的经济补偿作用更加令人注目。在一些地方，不少领导干部开始关心保险工作；越来越多的群众也渐渐舍得花钱买保险了。但就全社会而言，人们的保险意识仍然薄弱。许多人宁愿互相攀比或者竞相购买高档消费品，或者大吃大喝，甚至花钱烧香拜佛，而不肯拿出少量的钱来投保防险。这种消费方式既加剧了市场物资紧缺和物价居高不下的状况，又不利于经济的稳定和发展。要改变这种状况，就必须拓宽过去狭窄的消费领域，引导人们把消费视野从吃喝穿用延伸到参加保险、投资股票、债券和购买住房等方面上来。
    目前，在我国１０亿人口中投保各类人身险的仅７０００万人次，投保家庭财产险的只有５７００多万户，个人平均支付保费不到２元钱。这说明，我国保险市场潜力十分巨大，保费支出占人们消费总支出比重很小，随着生活水平的逐年提高，多数人完全有能力通过参加保险解除生产和生活中的后顾之忧，而不必总躺在国家身上吃“救济”、“补助”的大锅饭。另一方面，保险公司将保费收入集中起来，除一部分用于赔偿外，其余可作为信贷资金投入生产建设。青岛市保险公司把发展保险业与优化资金投向结合起来的作法，是十分可取的。
