    Researcher Ding Shouhe of the Institute of Modern History at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences wrote in the *China Culture Daily* that the concept of minben (the people as the foundation) is highly developed in traditional Chinese culture, such as the ideas of benefiting the people, aiding the people, and protecting the people. However, this "people" is passive, in the position of an object, merely the recipient of benevolence and favors. Feudal society emphasized minben to maintain "long-term stability" and a "prosperous era." On the other hand, peasants living in a small-scale agricultural economy hoped for a sage ruler and a fair judge to protect them. Therefore, feudal minben thought was a mutual need of both the rulers and the ruled.

    Minben thought had a certain progressive role in feudal society, but it is fundamentally different from modern democratic thought. Democracy is not about ruling for the people but "by the people, not for the people," where the majority of citizens consciously take the position of masters. Without this, it is difficult to achieve cultural modernization. Today, many people still remain at the level of minben thought and have not yet entered the realm of democratic thought; some do not even possess minben thought. Alongside the phenomenon of "official profiteering" is undoubtedly the "fair judge" mentality. We must clarify that democracy is not just a method and style; it is a goal and a way of life, the primary indicator of cultural modernization.

    民主和民本的区别
    中国社会科学院近代史研究所研究员丁守和在《中国文化报》上撰文说：中国传统文化中民本思想很发达，如利民、惠民、保民，等等。但这个“民”是被动的，处于宾语的地位，只是被恩赐和惠授的对象。封建社会强调民本是为了维护“长治久安”和“太平盛世”；另一方面生活在小农经济土壤之上的农民，希望有圣君和青天来保护自己。因而，封建的民本思想是统治者和被统治者双方面共同的需求。
    民本思想在封建社会具有一定的进步作用，但同近代的民主思想根本不同。民主不是为民做主，是“由民而非为民”也，是多数国民自觉地居于主人的主动地位。达不到这一点，很难实现文化的现代化。当今，许多人仍然停留在民本思想的水平，还没有进入民主思想的层次，甚至连民本思想都不具备。与“官倒”现象并列的肯定是“青天”思想。我们必须明确，民主不仅仅是方法和作风，而是目的和一种生活方式，是文化现代化的首要指标。
