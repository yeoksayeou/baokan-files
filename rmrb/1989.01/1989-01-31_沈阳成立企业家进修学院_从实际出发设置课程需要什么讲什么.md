Shenyang Establishes an Academy for Business Leaders' Continuing Education
Courses Set Based on Actual Needs

SHENYANG, Jan. 30 (Xinhua) — The Shenyang Academy for Business Leaders' Continuing Education was officially established this afternoon.

With the deepening of economic reforms and the development of a socialist market economy, a broad stratum of managers is emerging. They urgently need to improve their qualifications to become genuine business leaders. In response to this situation, the Shenyang Business Leaders' Association, the Shenyang Enterprise Management Association, and the Shenyang Institute of Finance and Economics proposed the establishment of the Shenyang Academy for Business Leaders' Continuing Education, which has been approved by relevant departments.

The academy's curriculum is designed based on practical needs, focusing on what is required. Initially, around 30 courses will be offered, including macroeconomics and microeconomics in socialism, enterprise finance and accounting, economic law, and international economics and trade.
