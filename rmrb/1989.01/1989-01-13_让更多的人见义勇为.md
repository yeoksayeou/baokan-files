Even heroes shed tears sometimes. The magazine "China Youth" once published a news item about "A young hero in the style of Ouyang Hai" named Dai Bijing. Twenty years ago, she rushed to save three children who were playing on the railroad tracks and was run over by a train, resulting in the amputation of her left leg and left arm. This once-famous heroine now finds herself in a dire living situation: plagued by illness, malnourished, and leading a miserable life.

The young farmer Liu Xianzhong stood up on a public bus and fought against five thugs, sustaining severe injuries that left him unable to work. Now, he struggles to tend to his responsibility fields, faces financial difficulties, and lives in hardship.

Dai Bijing and Liu Xianzhong acted bravely for justice, resulting in their injuries. Society should bestow upon them high honors and also take good care of their lives. However, currently, many heroes like them receive insufficient care, which is disheartening.

I believe this is not the fault of the surrounding community for lacking concern, nor is it the fault of the unit leaders for not paying attention. The main issue lies in the lack of clear regulations on this matter. Leaders of relevant regions and units have the intention to take care of these respectable heroes but have no guidelines to follow.

For many years, the military has had clear regulations for the care of injured and disabled personnel. Whether in peacetime or wartime, officers and soldiers who are injured or disabled in the line of duty can receive corresponding benefits based on the severity of their injuries. This is undoubtedly a significant reason why our soldiers can act fearlessly and bravely when needed.

The situation in civilian areas is different from that in the military, and everything cannot be directly copied. However, this approach is worth learning from. If the relevant national departments can promptly issue appropriate regulations, then when people's lives and property are threatened, and when thugs commit crimes, there will definitely be more people who stand up bravely.

　　让更多的人见义勇为
    顾仁君
    英雄也有流泪的时候。《中国青年》曾刊登了这样一则消息：“欧阳海式的小英雄”戴碧蓉，２０年前为抢救在铁轨上玩耍的三个儿童，被火车碾过造成左腿、左臂高位截肢。这位名扬一时的英雄，至今生活陷入了困境：伤病缠身，营养不良，日子凄惨。
    青年农民刘宪忠，在公共汽车上挺身而出，与五名歹徒搏斗，被打成重伤，丧失了劳动能力，如今他责任田无力耕种，经济拮据，生活困难。
    戴碧蓉、刘宪忠见义勇为，以致伤残，社会应该给他们以崇高的荣誉，还应该很好地关心他们的生活。然而时下，对很多像他们这样的英雄关怀照顾得太不够了，不能不让人听了寒心。
    我想，这不能怪周围群众不关心，也不能怪单位领导不重视，主要问题在于，对这个问题没有一个明确的规定。有关地区和单位的领导对这些可敬的英雄有心照顾，却无章可循。
    多年来，部队上对于伤残者的抚养一直有明确的规定。无论平时战时，干部战士，凡因公致伤致残的，均可视伤情评定等级，享受相应的待遇。我们的官兵在需要时，都能义无返顾、勇往直前，这不能不说是个重要原因。
    地方不同于部队，不能一切照搬，但这一做法却值得参考。如果国家有关部门对此能尽快做出恰当的规定来，那么在人民的生命财产受到威胁时，在流氓歹徒行凶作恶时，一定会有更多的人挺身而出。
