Xiamen, January 11 (Reporter) — From the national conference on the cultivation and development of dual-use personnel held here, it is learned that significant achievements have been made in the cultivation and development of dual-use personnel nationwide, which has effectively promoted the country's reform and economic construction.

Among them, 380,000 have become managers of township enterprises, 2,600 have been awarded the title of "Outstanding Township Enterprise Leader," and 420,000 have entered various levels of rural leadership.

The conference, jointly organized by the Ministry of Civil Affairs and the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army, was attended by more than 200 representatives. The main tasks of the conference are: to study and discuss how to integrate the cultivation and development of dual-use personnel with the overall layout of improving the national scientific and cultural level and developing productive forces; to summarize and exchange experiences in the work of cultivating and developing military-civilian dual-use personnel over the past 10 years; to commend advanced units and individuals; to propose new tasks and requirements, and to explore new ways of work.
