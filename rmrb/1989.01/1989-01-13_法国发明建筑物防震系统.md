French scientists have recently developed a device to prevent buildings from shaking, and experiments have shown that it is effective.

According to French newspapers, this building anti-seismic device is called the "anti-seismic structural system." Its principle is to install shock absorbers on the bottom of buildings, similar to those in cars, to reduce shaking and mitigate disasters during earthquakes.

The "anti-seismic structural system" mainly separates the upper structure of the building from its foundation, installing rubber pads and shock absorbers in between to absorb seismic energy, so that the upper structure only experiences slight shaking during an earthquake. The main part of the shock absorption device is a giant cylindrical rubber pad made of steel plates and rubber. Each rubber pad has a diameter of about 50 centimeters and a height of about 40 centimeters, installed vertically below each column of the structure, fixed top and bottom in concrete with screws. Thus, the entire building is essentially placed on dozens or even hundreds of rubber pads. During an earthquake, the displacement of the structure causes compression, deforming the rubber pads. Therefore, special steel rods are used to vertically connect the structure and the foundation, and during an earthquake, they can work together to twist and deform to suppress the amplitude.

　　法国发明建筑物防震系统
    新华社巴黎１月１０日电  （记者茅瑞清）法国科学家最近研制成功一种防止建筑物震动的装置，经试验证明，效果很好。
    据法国报纸报道，这种建筑物防震设备叫“防震结构系统”，其原理是在建筑物底部像汽车一样安装上避震器，当地震发生时可降低震动，减轻灾害。
    这种“防震结构系统”主要是将建筑物的上部结构体与基础分开，中间安装上橡胶垫及减震器，吸收地震能量，使上部结构体在地震时只产生轻微晃动。避震设备的主要部分是由钢板和橡胶制成的巨型圆柱状橡胶垫。每个橡胶垫的直径约５０厘米，高约４０厘米，安装在结构体每根柱子的垂直下方，以螺丝上下固定在混凝土中。这样，整栋建筑物实际上等于安放在数十个乃至上百个橡胶垫上。当地震时，因结构体位移造成压迫，会使橡胶垫变形。因此再配合以特殊钢棒制成的减震器来垂直连接结构体和基础，地震时可配合扭曲变形以抑制振幅。
