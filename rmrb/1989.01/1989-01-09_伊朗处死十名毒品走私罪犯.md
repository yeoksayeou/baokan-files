Iran executed ten drug traffickers in the capital Tehran on the 7th.

These ten traffickers were accused of trafficking up to seventy-six kilograms of heroin and five hundred thirty kilograms of opium. They were also accused of establishing drug sales networks in many cities.

Drug abuse is one of Iran's major social problems. It is reported that dozens of tons of drugs are seized each year.

According to Iran's anti-drug law issued last December, anyone found carrying or trafficking five kilograms or more of opium or three grams or more of heroin or morphine will be sentenced to death.
