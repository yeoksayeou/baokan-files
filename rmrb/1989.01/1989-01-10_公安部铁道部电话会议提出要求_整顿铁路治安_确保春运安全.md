The Ministry of Public Security and the Ministry of Railways held a telephone conference in Beijing today, demanding that all railway systems and public security organs across the country vigorously rectify railway security and ensure safety during the Spring Festival travel season.

State Councilor and Minister of Public Security Wang Fang said in his speech at the telephone conference that to improve railway security work, comprehensive governance must be strengthened. Under the unified leadership of the Party committee and the government, comprehensive measures such as economic, administrative, legal, disciplinary, and ideological and political work must be employed. The principles of combining sectoral and regional efforts, internal and external coordination, and management and operations must be followed to improve railway security.

Deputy Minister of Public Security Gu Linhang, in his speech, required railway and railway-line public security organs to swiftly launch a special campaign to crack down on criminal activities. Gu Linhang proposed focusing on combating criminal elements and gangs that engage in robbery, theft, hooliganism, rape, and other criminal activities on trains and at stations. He emphasized the need to resolutely strike down those who prey on the railway, known as "sitting tigers." For those who scalp tickets, engage in brawls, cause trouble, gamble, forcefully sell goods, or board trains without tickets, strict actions must be taken.

Gu Linhang also proposed strengthening the rectification of railway security order, focusing on the prohibition of flammable, explosive, and dangerous goods. He called for extensive safety inspections, and for those who illegally carry dangerous goods, especially those causing accidents, to be severely punished by law.

Deputy Minister of Railways Luo Yunguang, in his speech at the telephone conference, required all levels of railway departments to seriously implement the safety responsibility system and carry out comprehensive governance of railway security. He said that to strengthen leadership and ensure safety during the Spring Festival travel season, all railway bureaus, sub-bureaus, and stations must be led by principal leaders, with relevant departments such as transportation, passenger transport, public security, safety supervision, and railway spirit office participating, to organize specialized teams to handle Spring Festival travel work. He demanded that all levels of railway departments resolutely address problems in the comprehensive governance of railway security, especially those involving buck-passing, procrastination, and long-standing issues, and take decisive measures to enforce strict responsibility, management, discipline, and rewards and punishments.
