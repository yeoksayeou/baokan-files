	Clearing Corruption and Purifying the Party's Organization:
	Guizhou Seriously Investigates and Punishes Cases of Party Members Violating Discipline

	Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang: Reporters Pan Di Du and Hu Yue Ping report: Last year, various levels of disciplinary committees in Guizhou Province investigated and handled various cases of disciplinary violations, resulting in 818 party members being expelled from the party.

	This information was recently released by the Guizhou Provincial Disciplinary Committee. In a written statement, the provincial disciplinary committee stated: Those who were expelled from the party included individuals who committed crimes such as embezzlement, bribery, extortion, and blackmail; those who used their power for personal gain; those whose bureaucratism caused significant losses; and those who participated in illegal trading and the production of counterfeit and substandard goods, disrupting the market. Those who violated criminal laws have been handed over to judicial authorities for punishment. Meng Qi Zhi, an accountant at a financial institution in Le Ping District, Pingba County, embezzled 600,000 yuan and was expelled from the party and executed according to law. In Zhu Cang Township, Wannan County, 13 out of 14 party and government officials, including Township Head He Jianchun and Township Party Committee Secretary Wei De, collectively embezzled and misappropriated public funds totaling over 57,000 yuan from December 1984 to January 1988. He Jianchun and others have been expelled from the party, and the case has been handed over to judicial authorities for punishment.

	According to statistics, from the 13th Party Congress to November 30, 1988, various levels of disciplinary committees in Guizhou Province have uncovered 2,913 cases of party members violating discipline. As of now, 2,531 cases have been closed, accounting for 87% of the total cases. Among the closed cases, 2,445 individuals have received disciplinary penalties. Among those penalized, 58 are county-level or higher officials.

	After the serious investigation and punishment of party and government officials' disciplinary violations were publicized in local newspapers, they sparked a strong response. People said: Handling disciplinary violations among party members shows that serious measures are being taken to eliminate corruption.

	To help those who have been penalized, various levels of disciplinary committees in Guizhou Province have actively conducted follow-up education while investigating disciplinary violations. It is reported that last year, various levels of disciplinary committees conducted follow-up visits and assessments of 813 penalized party members. The majority of penalized party members have recognized their mistakes, regained their spirit, and actively participated in work to correct their errors.

　　清除腐败现象　纯洁党的组织
    贵州严肃查处党员违纪案件
    本报贵阳电  记者潘帝都、胡跃平报道：去年，贵州省各级纪委在查处各类违纪案件中，有８１８名党员被清除出党。
    这是贵州省纪委近日公布的。省纪委在一份书面材料中称：这些被开除党籍的人，有的犯有贪污受贿、敲诈勒索罪；有的以权谋私；有的因官僚主义造成重大损失；有的参与倒买倒卖、制造伪劣商品等，扰乱市场。对其中触犯刑律的，已移交司法机关惩处。平坝县乐平区一家金融单位的会计孟启智贪污６０万元，被开除党籍，依法处决。瓮安县朱藏乡１４名党政干部中，乡长何建春、乡党委书记韦德均为首的１３人从１９８４年１２月至１９８８年１月，集体贪污和私分公款５７０００多元，何建春等人已被开除党籍，此案已移交司法机关惩处。
    据统计，贵州省各级纪委从党的十三大以后到１９８８年１１月底，已查出各类党员违纪案件２９１３起。目前已结案２５３１起，占立案数的８７％。在已结的案件中，有２４４５人受到党纪处分。受处分的人中，有县（处）级以上干部５８人。
    贵州省严肃查处党员干部违纪案件在当地报上公布后，引起强烈反响。人们说：处理违纪党员，说明在清除腐败现象上动了真格。
    为挽救受处分的党员，贵州省各级纪委在查处违纪案件的同时，积极开展回访教育。据悉，去年各级纪委共回访考察了受处分党员８１３人。多数受处分党员认识了错误，振作起精神，以积极的态度投入工作，改正错误。
