Title: Boredom Leads to Reading

The editor's note: At the start of the new year, the *Dadi* supplement has opened a special column titled "Seven Flavors of Book Talk." We have invited seven distinguished writers to contribute short articles on books. They are: Feng Yida, who once served as the editor of *Dushu*; Yang Ruo, who has engaged with Don Quixote; Dong Lushan, who focuses on Buddhist scriptures; Zong Pu, who never forgets the southward journey; Yang Xianyu, whose writing is inspired by alcohol; Jin Kemu, whose mischievous spirit remains undiminished; and Huang Miaozhi, whose literary earnings are less than his calligraphy. These seven gentlemen will discuss books, critique literature, talk about people and events, and guide readers through the seven flavors of life—bitter, spicy, sour, sweet, pungent, salty, and numbing—hidden within books. This will add some literary enjoyment to your tea breaks and spark some conversation after your drinks.

Today, let's start with Feng Yida's opening remarks—

The ancients said, "It is better to go without meat than to live without bamboo." In the past, those living in courtyard houses could plant flowers and trees in front of their homes. Those with the means could even plant bamboo. Nowadays, intellectuals have mostly moved into high-rise apartments in residential communities or live in crowded city dwellings. Looking out from a height, one can say that all four directions are empty, the eyes are clear, and there is no place to plant bamboo, let alone engage in such a refined activity. Even planting a few pots of flowers is difficult. For someone like me, who has no balcony, I can only squeeze a few pots of hanging ivy onto the windowsill. Even if one does not eat meat, there is no place to plant bamboo, let alone learn from bamboo's upright and towering spirit. What accompanies intellectuals today is probably just piles of broken books.

Our generation naturally does not believe in the nonsense of "books contain beautiful women" and "books contain golden houses." A lifetime of reading is simply because there is nothing else to do. The ancients only knew that "scholars are useless in a hundred ways," but they did not know that Lu Xun's poem says, "Boredom leads to reading." Of course, although one reads out of boredom, reading is not boring. The more books one reads, the smarter and more refined one becomes. Not only does one's cultural level improve, but one's character and upbringing can also align with a civilized world. Therefore, although one lives without bamboo, it is fortunate to have a house full of broken books to comfort oneself.

After reading, one naturally has some thoughts, which may not necessarily need to be shared with others, but writing them down is also acceptable. Saying a few words that are pleasing or not so pleasing to the ear is better than sitting down to play a few rounds of mahjong to pass the time.

Recently, many enlightened individuals have lamented the decline of our country's culture. It is better to take action than to just talk. To escape this cultural predicament, promoting reading is at least not a bad idea. If everyone reads more good books, perhaps it will not be in vain to toil over one's own trivial pursuits. Even if we step back a million steps, everyone can speak elegantly and behave civilly, and will not speak rudely. Education and cultural level have always been twins. In that case, we would not need to use slogans like "thank you" and "hello" to enlighten people's "beautiful souls." Of course, there are also many people who have read many books but are still not civilized, which shows that reading is beneficial, but it is not a panacea.

The column is titled "Seven Flavors of Book Talk," which is simply a play on words with "seven people." I do not dare to say that the articles are particularly flavorful. When people are bored, they think of reading more books, but after reading, they may find more troubles. However, as one grows older, apart from reading, one cannot think of a better thing to do. And once one starts reading, one cannot help but comment, which may somewhat help the world and people's hearts? Thinking of this, the scholar does not need to be overly discouraged.

### 无聊才读书

第8版(副刊)
专栏：七味书谭

　　无聊才读书
    冯亦代 
    编者按：新年伊始，《大地》副刊特辟专栏“七味书谭”，请来七位大手笔写点品书小文章。他们是：在《读书》当过“龙套”班头的冯亦代、和堂·吉诃德作过战的“杨门女将”杨绛、经文只取“西天”的董乐山、小说不忘“南渡”的宗璞、文思借助酒兴的杨宪益、“顽皮”不减少年的金克木和卖文实在不如卖字的黄苗子。七位先生将评书品书、论人论事、谈天说地、指东道西，将那书中蕴含着的人间七味——苦辣酸甜腥咸麻——细细品出，为读者诸君茶余添点读趣，酒后增点谈兴。
    今日，请先听冯亦代先生的开场锣鼓——
    古人有云：“宁可食无肉，不可居无竹。”过去住的四合院，庭前可以种花植树，有条件的当然可以种竹。如今的知识分子已多迁居于小区的高楼大厦，或杂居在闹市的居民楼里，登高一眺，可说是四大皆空，眼目清净，不要说种竹这样高雅的事情，就是栽种几盆花草，亦属不易，像我这样居室无阳台的，便只能一年四季在窗沿上挤进几盆吊兰。即使不吃肉，也无处可以种竹，枉论观竹来怡情养性，学竹那样的风骨峥嵘了。如今伴随知识分子的大概只是盈?的破书而已。
    我们这一代人自然无人会信“书中自有颜如玉”和“书中自有黄金屋”的鬼话，一辈子读点书，实在是因为也干不了别的。古人只知“百无一用是书生”，却不知鲁迅诗云“无聊才读书”。当然，虽说无聊才读书，但读书并非无聊。书多读些，人会聪明一些，灵秀一些，不但文化水平有所提高，在品性教养上也能向文明世界看齐。因此，虽然居而无竹，差幸屋有断简残篇，也足以自慰了。
    读了书，不免会有些感想，虽不能定要为外人道，但写出来也无不可。说些听得入耳的或不甚入耳的话来，总比坐下来打几圈麻将牌消磨时光要强一些吧。
    近来不少有识之士对我国的文化滑坡，大有感喟。坐而言不如起而行，要脱身这个文化困境，提倡读书至少不是一种太坏的办法。如果每个人能多读些好书，或许会不枉费心机于一己的营营苟苟。退后一万步讲，大家可以谈吐文雅、举止文明些，不会开口粗鲁。教养与文化水平历来是孪生子。那样，我们也就不必再用“谢谢”、“您好”……等等只提礼貌的标语口号来启迪人的“心灵美”了。当然，读了不少书而仍不文明的人也不少，由此可见，读书虽有益，却也不是包治百病的灵丹妙药。
    栏目冠以“七味书谭”，无非是取“七位”之谐音，不敢说文章多么有“味”。人无聊时想到多读点书，但读了书保不定更觉烦恼。可是，人老了，除了读书，真想不出更好的事情做了。而一读点书，又忍不住要发几句议论，或许多少也会有助于世道人心？想到此，书生倒也不必过份自馁了。
