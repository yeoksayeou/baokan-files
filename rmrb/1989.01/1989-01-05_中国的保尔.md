Upon entering Comrade Gao Sizhi's living room, one immediately felt the atmosphere had changed completely.

In the past, the room was filled with a dazzling array of items, almost like a world of red scarves. There were red scarves made of cloth, silk, and nylon; there were models of airplanes and ships, semiconductors, globes, small picture books, yellow wood carvings, and embroidered bags from the Jingpo ethnic group, all made by children's small hands. Many gifts were inscribed with the names of the youth groups and science and technology groups named after Old Gao. Millions of red scarves expressed their respect and gratitude for Grandpa Gao.

But now, all these items were covered with large pieces of white cloth, turning the room into a memorial hall for him. On the platform were wreaths and couplets from his family, and in the center was a photograph of him in his youth, still so handsome, so full of vitality, so "cool."

From this photograph, I vaguely recognized the Gao Sizhi I knew 57 years ago. In the autumn and winter of 1930, he and my uncle Li Gongpu returned from the United States one after the other. Soon, he took up the position of director of the pathology department at the Central Hospital in Nanjing. However, he could not tolerate the corruption in the hospital and frequently clashed with the director, leading to a breakdown in their relationship and his eventual resignation. In early 1931, Li Gongpu invited him to move in with us. He was fifteen or sixteen years older than me, but he was childlike at heart, and we could talk and play together. Although his movements were slightly slow, he was still relatively normal, except that he would have an episode every few weeks. During these episodes, his eyes would roll up, his hands would shake, his body would stiffen, and his expressive face would become blank. Sometimes, his speech would also become unclear. Initially, these episodes would last for a couple of hours, but they became more frequent and longer over time. I asked him what was wrong. He told me that in 1925, he went from Tsinghua University to the University of Wisconsin in the United States to study chemistry, then transferred to the University of Chicago, where he obtained a bachelor's degree. Later, he specialized in bacteriology at the University of Chicago. He studied bacteriology because he understood from his brother, who died of diphtheria, and his sister, who died of cholera, that bacteria are the "little devils" that harm people. Researching how to defeat these detestable "little devils" was an effective weapon to save the people of our country from bacterial disasters. In 1928, he obtained a master's degree in bacteriology from the University of Chicago and was hired as an assistant in the bacteriology laboratory. Initially, he researched "food-poisoning bacteria." To study the harm that bacteria cause to the human body, he ignored his colleagues' advice and used his own body as an experiment, ingesting a type of bacterial vaccine called "B. Aertrycke," and made detailed records. Then he focused on researching encephalitis viruses. It was also at this time that a fatal blow struck him. While observing an experiment under a microscope, a bottle containing the virus suddenly broke, and a "little devil" entered his brain through his ear, damaging his central nervous system. Despite multiple treatments, it was ineffective. Therefore, he had to interrupt his doctoral thesis in 1930 and return to China early.

In 1932, Li Gongpu went to Shanghai to prepare for the Life Daily and later founded the Life and Reading Fortnightly. At this time, he invited Gao Sizhi to Shanghai. From then on, he began his career in writing popular science and children's literature.

In 1937, he went to Yan'an. In 1938, Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Zhou Enlai both visited him. In December of the same year, when his condition worsened, he joined the Communist Party of China. At that time, my uncle and aunt also went to Yan'an, and we went together to visit him at the Central Cadres' Rest Home. At that time, he was seriously ill, often sitting in a chair, with difficulty moving and speaking unclearly. However, he was still full of laughter and vigor. The bacteria had ravaged his body but could not ravage his spirit. He enthusiastically told us that he had not and would not put down his pen. He would use this weapon not only to fight against the bacterial "little devils" but also to continue the fight against Japanese imperialism and the dark social system, the "big devil."

From 1939 to 1949, he traveled through Chongqing, Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Guilin, Shanghai, and Taiwan, seeking treatment, but to no avail. In 1949, he returned to the mainland from Taiwan and participated in the first session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, continuing his writing under the five-star red flag.

From the time Gao Laoshi first published "The Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation of Bacteria" and "Our Anti-Enemy Heroes" in the Life and Reading Fortnightly, I have loved his popular science writings. These popular science writings vividly use the first person and personification to tell lively and engaging stories that deeply explore the mysteries from the tiny bacteria that are invisible to the human eye to the boundless universe. Science requires logical thinking, while literature must use imagery; science is rigorous, while literature is somewhat romantic. They are like oil and water, incompatible. Gao Laoshi ingeniously combined them, making him one of the pioneers in China to creatively and popularly combine science and literature.

After I returned to Beijing from Hubei in 1975, I often visited him. He was already over seventy, and his condition had worsened. All his actions almost entirely depended on his wife, Jin Aidi, who poured all her love into him. She dressed him, fed him. Although Gao Laoshi's stiff hand could still hold a pen after training, writing a single character sometimes took one or two minutes. He spoke unclearly, sometimes only able to make "uh-uh" sounds. Only she and his son Gao Zhiqun could understand him. Even so, he still stubbornly refused to put down his pen.

In December 1984, he personally wrote down his motto: "What I can do is limited, but what I want to do is infinite. From the moment of birth to the last breath, I will strive to extend the limited to the infinite!"

He spent his life yearning for light, pursuing truth, loving the people, and being loyal to the Party. He was pure and innocent, without personal gain. With over 5 million words of popular science and literary works, he nurtured several generations, gained the love of young people, created a miracle of life, and wrote a brilliant chapter in the history of Chinese science and literature. The Soviet Union had a Paul Korchagin. China had a Gao Sizhi. He was indeed a hero of our Chinese nation.

    中国的保尔
    张则孙
    一走进高士其同志的客厅里，就感到景象完全变了。
    过去，这里琳琅满目，几乎是红领巾的世界。有布的、绸的、尼龙的红领巾；有孩子们的小手做成的飞机轮船模型、半导体、地球仪、小画册、黄杨木雕、景颇族的绣花袋。不少礼物署着用高老名字命名的少先队和科技小组。千万个红领巾在这里表达了他们对高爷爷的敬爱和感激之情。
    但是现在呢，这些都被大块的白布盖住了，成了哀悼他的灵堂。台子上有他家属献的花圈和挽联，中间是他年青时的照片，还是那么英俊潇洒，那么朝气蓬勃，那么“帅”。
    从这个照片上，我依稀地找到了５７年以前我认识的高士其。１９３０年秋冬，他和我的姨父李公朴先后从美国回来。不久他到南京中央医院任检验科主任。但是，他看不惯医院的腐败，多次和院长抗争，关系破裂，愤然辞职。１９３１年初，李公朴请他搬到我们家住。他比我大十五六岁，但是他童心未泯，我们都能谈在一起，玩在一起。平时他虽然动作稍有迟钝，但还比较正常，只是每隔几个星期就要犯一次病。犯病时，两个眼球向上翻，双手抖动，全身僵硬，他那富有表情的脸也变得呆板，有时说话也听不清了。每次开始是一两个小时，后来越来越频繁，时间也越来越长。我问他这是怎么回事。他告诉我，他在１９２５年从清华到美国威斯康辛大学化学系学习，后来转学到芝加哥大学，获得了学士学位。接着又在芝加哥大学专攻细菌学，他攻细菌学，是因为他从他死于白喉的弟弟和死于霍乱的姐姐那里，懂得了细菌是杀害人们的“小魔王”。研究如何战胜这些可恶的“小魔王”，是挽救祖国人民免受细菌灾害的有效武器。１９２８年，他在芝加哥大学获得了细菌学硕士的学位，并且被聘为细菌学系实验室助理。开始，他研究“食物毒细菌”。为了研究细菌对人体的危害，他不顾同事的劝阻，以自己的身体作试验，吞食了一种名为“Ｂ·Ａｅｒｔｒｙｃｋｅ”的病菌苗，还作了详细的记录。接着他又集中研究脑炎病毒。也正在这时，一个对他的致命打击降临到他的头上。在用显微镜做试验观察时，装有病毒的瓶子突然破裂，一个“小魔王”从他的耳朵里钻进了小脑，破坏了他的中枢运动神经，经过多次治疗也未见效。因此，他不能不在１９３０年中断了他的博士论文，提前回国。
    １９３２年，李公朴去上海筹办生活日报，并在后来创办了读书生活半月刊。这时他邀高士其到了上海。从此他就开始走上了科学小品和儿童文学的创作之路。
    １９３７年，他去了延安。１９３８年，毛泽东同志和周恩来同志都去看了他。同年１２月，在他病情加重的时候，他加入了中国共产党。这时我和姨父姨母也到了延安，我们一起去中央干部休养所看望了他。那时他病的厉害了，经常坐在椅子上，行动困难、说话不清。但是，他仍是笑声不断，英姿焕发。病菌摧残了他的身体，却摧残不了他的精神。他热情地告诉我们，他没有也不会放下手中的笔，他要用这个武器不仅同细菌“小魔王”，而且要向日本帝国主义和黑暗的社会制度这个“大魔王”继续战斗。
    １９３９年４月到１９４９年，他辗转于重庆、香港、广州、桂林、上海、台湾等地，寻求治疗，仍未见效。１９４９年他从台湾回到了大陆，参加了首届中国人民政治协商会议，在五星红旗下继续创作。
    从高老最初发表在读书生活半月刊上的“细菌的衣、食、住、行”和“我们的抗敌英雄”起，我就热爱他的科学小品。这些科学小品，形象地以第一人称、拟人的手法，用生动活泼、娓娓动听的故事，深入地探索了从人们眼睛看不见的微小细菌，到无垠的宇宙的秘密。科学要用逻辑思维，文艺必须用形象思维；科学是严谨的，文艺却有些浪漫。它们像是油和水，格格不入。高老极其巧妙地将它们共冶一炉，他是中国创造性地、通俗地把科学和文艺结合起来的一个创始人。
    １９７５年，我从湖北回到北京以后，又常常去探望他。他已经年逾古稀，病情更加恶化。所有行动，几乎全靠那把全部的爱都倾注在他身上的妻子金爱娣。衣服她给穿，吃饭她给喂。虽然高老僵硬的手经过锻炼还能握笔，但写一个字有时要花一两分钟。他说话听不清，有时只能嗯嗯的出声。这些也只有她和儿子高志其才能翻译。即使这样，他仍然顽强不屈地不肯放下手中的笔。
    １９８４年１２月，他亲笔写下了自己的座右铭：“我能作的是有限的，我想作的是无穷的。从有生之年到一息尚存，我当尽力使有限向无穷延伸！”
    他一生向往光明，追求真理，热爱人民，对党忠贞，天真纯朴，没有私心。他用５００多万字的科普和文学作品，陶冶了几代人，受到了青少年的热爱，创造了生命的奇迹，在中国科学史和文学史上谱写了一曲身残志坚、生命不息、战斗不止的光辉乐章。苏联有个保尔·科察金。中国有个高士其。他不愧为我们中华民族的英雄。
