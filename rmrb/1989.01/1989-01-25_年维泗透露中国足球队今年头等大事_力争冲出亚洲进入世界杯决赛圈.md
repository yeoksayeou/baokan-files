Chinese Football Association Chairman Year Weishi today revealed to reporters that striving for a spot in the 14th World Cup football tournament's Asian qualifying round will be the most important task for Chinese football this year. Preparations are already underway.

The Chinese national football team is currently training at the Kunming base. In early February, they will travel to Hong Kong to participate in the Lunar New Year Cup International Football Invitational Tournament, where they will compete against strong teams from Hong Kong, Denmark, and Sweden. After this warm-up match, the Chinese team will face Bangladesh and Thailand in three World Cup qualifying matches from February 23 to March 4. In May, the team will use a visit to Japan to warm up again, preparing for three matches against Thailand and Iran in mid-to-late June. If the team can successfully pass the group stage, they will join the top teams from the other five groups in Asia to compete for a spot in the finals in Rome.

Year Weishi said that participating in the World Cup qualifying round is crucial for the future of Chinese football. Winning this battle is important for the 1990 Beijing Asian Games and other events. The football community must support the national team in this competition with all their might, just as they did during the 1987 Olympic qualifying matches. Although this year's World Cup qualifying round has eliminated the East Asia and West Asia divisions, making it seem unfavorable for the Chinese team, even a slight chance must be seized with all efforts.

Year Weishi told reporters that the Chinese Football Association has learned from past World Cup and Olympic qualifying experiences. They will stick to the schedule approved by FIFA. During the Asian Cup final in December last year, researchers collected and organized technical data on major Asian opponents. Currently, the Chinese team's strength cannot be said to be superior to Iran, and they are at a disadvantage compared to Saudi Arabia. Even against teams of the same level, victory is not guaranteed.

Year Weishi said that the determination is firm, and all arrangements must serve the goal of qualifying for the World Cup. The Chinese Football Association will change the previous reward system, linking rewards to each qualifying match. Winning against one opponent will result in one reward. The Football Office of the State Sports Commission, which is responsible for various football-related tasks, will share the pressure with the national team. Year Weishi stated that if this event cannot be successfully completed, he is willing to take full responsibility.

　　年维泗透露中国足球队今年头等大事     
    力争冲出亚洲进入世界杯决赛圈
    本报北京１月２４日讯  记者汪大昭报道：中国足球协会主席年维泗今天在这里向记者透露，力争第１４届世界杯足球赛亚洲区外围赛出线权，将是中国足球界今年最重要的工作。目前，各项准备工作已经着手进行。
    中国足球队最近正在昆明训练基地集训，２月初将赴香港参加贺岁杯国际足球邀请赛，与香港、丹麦和瑞典等劲旅交锋。这次热身赛后，中国队将于２月２３日至３月４日先后与孟加拉国和泰国队进行世界杯外围赛的三场赛事。５月份，中国队还要利用访日比赛机会再次热身，迎接６月中下旬与泰国和伊朗队的三场比赛。假如小组赛能顺利过关，中国队便可与亚洲区其它５个小组的优胜队一起，争夺进军罗马的通行证。
    年维泗说，参加世界杯外围赛，关乎中国足球的命运，打响这一炮，对１９９０年北京亚运会等，都有重要意义。足球界要像１９８７年奥运会预赛时那样，尽最大力量支持国家队打好这次比赛。尽管本届世界杯预赛出线名额取消了东亚和西亚的划分，有人感到对中国队不利，但是，哪怕有一点希望，也要用全力去争取。
    年维泗告诉记者，中国足协吸取以往世界杯和奥运会预赛的教训，在比赛日程上坚持已经国际足联批准的安排。去年１２月亚洲杯决赛期间，科研人员搜集整理了亚洲主要对手的技术资料。目前，中国队的实力不能说比伊朗队强，与沙特阿拉伯队相比则处于劣势，即使是对同一水平的球队，也不能说准赢。
    年维泗说，决心已定，不打折扣，所有安排都必须服从争取世界杯外围赛出线的目标。中国足协将改变以往的奖励办法，把奖励与每一场外围赛联系起来，胜一个对手奖励一回。担负中国足坛各项业务工作的国家体委足球办公室将和国家队共同分担压力。年维泗表示，如果这桩赛事不能顺利完成，他本人甘愿承担责任。
