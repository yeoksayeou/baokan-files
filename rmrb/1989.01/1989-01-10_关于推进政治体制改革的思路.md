Since the 13th Party Congress, various levels of Party organizations in Jiangsu have, in accordance with the requirements of the Central Committee, taken Deng Xiaoping's important speech on "Reform of the Leadership System of the Party and the State" as their guide. They have actively explored and boldly practiced, giving political system reform a good start and promoting the development of economic system reform and other work. Reflecting on this period of work, we have a deep understanding of one point: we must adhere to the principle of being resolute and cautious, with leadership, organization, and step-by-step progress, actively and steadily pushing forward political system reform with a focus on key areas.

Being resolute and cautious is the complete guiding principle for carrying out political system reform. The two are neither opposed nor isolated. Being resolute means that in terms of ideological understanding, one must be firm and not waver; being cautious means that in terms of work guidance, one must be steady and not hasty. In leading this work, we have started from continuously improving ideological understanding and strengthening organizational leadership in these two aspects to push forward political system reform.

Carrying out political system reform requires caution, which is something we have always paid attention to and emphasized. However, in actual work, there is a tendency worth noting: some local and departmental leaders often consider this major task more cautiously and emphasize being resolute less. Among some local and departmental leaders, there is a different degree of "waiting, observing, and worrying" about political system reform. Waiting means thinking that the issues involved in political system reform are all sensitive, and how to proceed should wait for higher-level unified deployment; observing means looking at the movements of neighbors and then studying how to act; worrying means worrying that if it is not done well, it will cause chaos and affect local economic construction. Thus, in leadership work, there are more general calls and less specific research; more talking and less doing, while planned leadership is not enough. In response to these situations, recently our Provincial Party Committee held a provincial political system reform work conference to unify thinking and clarify the direction. It was proposed that in terms of understanding, we should properly handle "three relationships," and in terms of work, we should focus on "three key areas." The three relationships are: first, the relationship between rectifying the economic environment and economic order and deepening comprehensive reform; second, the relationship between economic system reform and political system reform; third, the relationship between strengthening Party leadership and political system reform. The three key areas are: separating government from enterprise, separating Party from government, and maintaining clean governance. Among these three tasks, we have placed separating government from enterprise in the first position, using it to drive and promote the development of other reforms.

We have placed separating government from enterprise as the focus of the next step in political system reform based on the following considerations: First, it is a need for rectification and order. The core of separating government from enterprise is "separation." The current main contradiction is in the "government" and not in the "enterprise." In the process of rectification and order, gradually straightening out the government-enterprise relationship is beneficial to creating a good external environment for enterprises. If enterprises are activated and economic benefits are improved, we can overcome difficulties, get rid of troubles, and ensure the stable development of the national economy. Second, the practical conditions for implementing separating government from enterprise are good. The target set by the central government is very clear, the voice of enterprises is high, the understanding of both upper and lower levels is relatively consistent, and especially after the promulgation of the "Enterprise Law," a strong legal basis has been provided. Third, separating government from enterprise is actually the intersection and junction of economic system reform and political system reform. In actual work, many contents of separating government from enterprise involve both economic system reform and political system reform, and the two are interconnected and intertwined, making it difficult to clearly separate them. Moreover, we have felt from actual work that separating government from enterprise can expose contradictions and "difficult points" in the setup of higher-level institutions. Therefore, separating government from enterprise is beneficial to institutional reform and can create conditions for institutional reform. Breaking through the difficult points of separating government from enterprise will greatly advance the entire reform.

Currently, we are considering separating Party from government from two aspects. First, we will clarify the functions of Party committees at all levels and local state power organs, gradually straighten out the relationship between Party organizations and the People's Congress, government, judicial organs, mass organizations, enterprises and institutions, and other social organizations, and achieve each doing their own job, and move towards institutionalization. Second, in the process of separating Party from government, Party organizations will disengage from administrative affairs, devote more energy to strengthening the Party's own construction, comprehensively improve the Party organization's combat effectiveness and cohesion, and play a leading and supervisory role.

Maintaining clean governance is an extremely urgent task for the Party and government at this stage. In the transitional stage between old and new systems, when the new order of socialist commodity economy has not yet been fundamentally established, maintaining the cleanliness of Party and government organs is particularly important. In the process of "dual-track" operation and the transition of old and new systems, anti-corruption work must achieve greater results based on the previous stage of work. First, leaders at all levels must attach great importance to it, place it on the work agenda, and grasp it continuously; second, from the institutional level, plug various loopholes, especially take corresponding measures for links where problems may occur; third, improve the supervision mechanism, give full play to the role of various levels and types of reporting centers, pay attention to media supervision and social public opinion supervision; fourth, implement administrative transparency, so that Party and government leaders and staff are under the supervision of the masses, effectively preventing the breeding of various unhealthy trends. Anti-corruption work must, as Comrade Zhao Ziyang said, truly achieve "do one thing, complete one thing; rectify one area, clean up one area."

In summary, political system reform cannot be carried out in advance without real conditions, nor can it be hindered by the drawbacks existing in the current system. We must continuously strengthen the ideological education of Party members and cadres, deeply understand the necessity and urgency of political system reform, and firmly and practically push forward political system reform according to the principles proposed by the 13th Party Congress and the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee.

　　关于推进政治体制改革的思路
    韩培信
    党的十三大以来，江苏各级党组织根据中央的要求，以邓小平同志关于《党和国家领导制度的改革》的重要讲话为指导，积极探索，大胆实践，使政治体制改革有了一个良好的开端，促进了经济体制改革和各项工作的发展。回顾这一段的工作，我们深有体会的一点是，必须贯彻坚决、审慎的方针，有领导、有组织、有步骤，积极稳妥、突出重点地推进政治体制改革。
    坚决、审慎是进行政治体制改革的完整的工作指导方针。两者既不对立，又不能孤立。所谓坚决，是指思想认识上必须坚定，不能摇摆；所谓审慎，是指工作指导上必须稳妥，不能草率。我们在领导这项工作中，就是从不断提高思想认识、切实加强组织领导这两个方面入手，推进政治体制改革的。
    进行政治体制改革，需要审慎，这是我们一直关注并予以强调的。但在实际工作中，有一种倾向值得注意，就是一些地方和部门的领导，对这件大事往往考虑审慎比较多，强调坚决则不够。在一些地方和部门的领导干部中，对政治体制改革不同程度地存在着“一等二看三担心”。一等，就是认为政治体制改革所涉及到的问题都很敏感，究竟如何搞，要等上级统一部署；二看，就是看左邻右舍的动静，然后再研究自己如何动作；三担心，就是担心搞不好会引起混乱，影响地方的经济建设。这样，在领导工作中就出现了一般号召多，具体研究少；说得多，做得少的现象，而领导有计划地开展则显得不够。针对这些情况，最近我们省委召开了全省政治体制改革工作会议，统一思想，明确路数。提出在认识上要摆正“三个关系”，在工作中要突出“三个重点”。三个关系：一是治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序与全面深化改革的关系；二是经济体制改革与政治体制改革的关系；三是加强党的领导与政治体制改革的关系。三个重点：即政企分开、党政分开和为政清廉。在这三项工作中，我们把政企分开放在第一位，以此带动和促进其他各项改革的开展。
    我们将政企分开作为下一步政治体制改革的重点，是基于这样的考虑：首先，这是治理、整顿的需要。政企分开的核心是“分”，当前的主要矛盾在“政”而不在“企”，在治理、整顿过程中，逐步理顺政企关系，有利于为企业创造一个良好的外部环境，企业搞活了，经济效益提高了，我们就能渡过难关，摆脱困扰，国民经济的稳定发展就有了可靠的保证。其次，实行政企分开的现实条件比较好。政企分开，中央提出的目标十分明确，企业的呼声很高，上下认识比较一致，特别是《企业法》颁布以后，提供了有力的法律依据。再次，政企分开实际上是经济体制改革和政治体制改革的交汇点和结合部。在实际工作中，政企分开的许多内容既涉及经济体制改革，也涉及政治体制改革，二者互相联系，互相交织，难以截然分开。而且，我们从实际工作中体会到，政企分开可以暴露上级机构设置中的矛盾和“难点”，因此，政企分开有利于机构改革，可以为机构改革创造条件。突破政企分开的难点，整个改革就会大大前进一步。
    党政分开，目前考虑从两个方面入手。一是划清各级地方党委与地方国家政权机关的职能，逐步理顺党组织与人民代表大会、政府、司法机关、群众团体、企事业单位和其他各种社会组织的关系，做到各司其职，并且走向制度化。二是在党政分开的过程中，党组织从行政事务中摆脱出来，用更多的精力加强党的自身建设，从整体上提高党组织的战斗力和凝聚力，发挥领导核心作用和监督保证作用。
    为政清廉，是现阶段党和政府面临的一项极为紧迫的任务。在新旧体制处于转换阶段，在适应社会主义商品经济的新秩序尚未根本确立的情况下，保持党政机关的廉洁，显得特别重要。在“双轨”并行，新旧体制交替过程中，廉政工作要在前一段工作基础上取得更大成效，一是各级领导要高度重视，摆到工作议事日程上，常抓不懈；二是从制度上堵塞各种漏洞，特别要针对有可能发生问题的环节，采取相应措施；三是健全监督机制，发挥各级各类举报中心的作用，重视新闻监督和社会舆论监督；四是实行政务公开，使党政机关的领导干部和工作人员置于广大群众的监督之下，有效地防止各种不正之风的滋生。抓廉政工作，要像紫阳同志所说的，真正做到办一件，成一件；整一片，治一片。
    总之，政治体制改革不能离开现实的条件超前进行，也不能让现行体制中存在的弊端阻碍改革的进程。我们要不断加强对党员干部的思想教育，深刻认识政治体制改革的必要性和紧迫性，按照党的十三大提出的原则，根据十三届三中全会的精神，坚定不移地、扎扎实实地推进政治体制改革。
