    商讨联合组队参加北京亚运会问题
    本报平壤１月２３日电  记者徐宝康报道：朝鲜奥委会委员长金玉顺今天致函南朝鲜奥委会委员长金中和，建议３月９日在板门店南方一侧的“和平之家”举行体育会谈，商讨组成北南统一队参加第１１届亚运会的具体问题。
    金玉顺在信中对南朝鲜１２月３０日复信同意就组成北南统一队问题举行会谈感到高兴，并认为“这是一件好事情”，给北南体育界和全体朝鲜人民的民主团结带来了新的希望。
    金玉顺在信中确信，如果北南双方摆脱了以往分歧的观念，在和解、信赖、团结的气氛中，真诚地进行对话，那么在组成统一队的问题上将取得良好成果。
    信中具体建议，３月９日上午１０时，北方将派出奥委会副委员长为团长的５人代表团前往板门店参加北南双方体育会谈。
    金玉顺的这封信，是今天上午通过板门店交给南方的。
