Huangfu Keren Attempts to Become an "Independent Producer"
"Desert Killer" Passes Censorship and Officially Released

The People's Daily, Beijing, January 14th - Reporter Li Li reports: Huangfu Keren, who has been widely noticed by the outside world as an "independent producer," today screened his film "Desert Killer" for the capital's news media. This film passed the censorship of the Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television's Film Bureau before the New Year and has now entered the commercial distribution channel.

In recent years, the production costs of various film studios have been rising sharply. The production process does not consider the distribution process, leading to a shortage of funds for film reproduction, making it difficult for film studios to continue. It was under this situation that Huangfu Keren, from outside the film industry (Gold Sea International Freight Forwarding Limited Company), raised funds for filming and reached an agreement with the Beijing Film Studio in June last year to produce the film.

After the film was screened, Deputy Director of the Beijing Film Studio, Zu Shaoqian, pointed out that the contract signed half a year ago carried little risk for the studio, while the risk for Huangfu Keren was considerable. Huangfu Keren firmly stated: The path of independent production is correct. He welcomes criticism from all sectors of society regarding the artistry of his film. Additionally, he stated that the profits from this film, after fulfilling the contract, will not be pocketed personally but will be used for film reproduction.

　　皇甫可人尝试当“独立制片人”
  　《荒原杀手》通过审查正式发行
    本报北京１月１４日讯  记者李力报道：曾为外界普遍关注的“独立制片人”皇甫可人，今天向首都新闻界映出了他的影片《荒原杀手》。这部影片于年前通过了广播影视部电影局的审查，目前已进入商业发行渠道。
    近年来，各电影厂家影片制作成本呈直线上升，生产环节不考虑发行环节，使电影再生产的资金短缺，电影厂难以为继。皇甫可人正是在这样的形势下，从电影界外部（金海国际储运有限公司）筹集了拍片资金，于去年６月与北京电影制片厂达成了拍片协议。
    影片放映后，北京电影制片厂副厂长祖绍先指出，半年前的那份合同对厂方来说风险并不大，而皇甫可人的风险是相当大的。皇甫可人则坚定地表示：走独立制片的路没有错。他欢迎社会各界对他的影片在艺术上提出批评。另外，他还表示，该片在履行完合同后所赚的钱不装个人腰包，而将用于电影再生产。
