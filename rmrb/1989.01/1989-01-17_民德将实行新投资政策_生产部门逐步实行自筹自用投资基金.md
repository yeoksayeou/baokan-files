East Germany to Implement New Investment Policy
	Production Departments to Gradually Implement Self-Raised and Self-Used Investment Funds

	Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 14th - (Reporter Wang Defeng) East Germany has decided that starting from 1990, except for approximately 300 large investment projects that have a significant impact on the national economy, the production sectors of the national economy will gradually implement a new investment policy of enterprise self-raised and self-used investment funds.

	This is a major measure taken by East Germany in the economic field based on its specific national conditions.

	According to reports, since the 1970s, East Germany's industrial investment has gradually decreased. In 1970, the state's investment in the production sectors of the economy still accounted for 16% of the entire national income, but by 1988, this had dropped to less than 10%. This investment policy has slowed down the renewal of industrial equipment and the modernization of technological transformations, and it has not been able to produce enough products that are competitive in both domestic and international markets. Since 1985, the trade between the two Germanys has shown a trend of stagnation and even decline, and one of the reasons is this.

	In view of this situation, East Germany, in 1988, implemented a trial in 16 national joint enterprises to expand the proportion of enterprise self-raised and self-used investment funds. Now, based on the experience of these enterprises, it has been decided to make this new investment method the direction for enterprises to solve the problem of expanding production investment funds.

	So far, the investment funds for enterprises have mainly come from the state budget, followed by pure profit allocations and equipment depreciation fees. The new investment policy stipulates that the investment funds needed for enterprises to expand production projects mainly come from three sources: enterprise pure profit allocations, equipment depreciation fees, and enterprise loans from banks. In this way, well-managed enterprises will obtain more pure profits, and after completing the state's pure profit submission targets, they can use more money to expand production.

	According to reports, the new investment policy implemented last year shows that doing so can encourage enterprises to be thrifty, pay attention to improving the input-output relationship, pay attention to improving investment benefits, and more actively take the path of intensive development.

### 民德将实行新投资政策  生产部门逐步实行自筹自用投资基金

　　民德将实行新投资政策
    生产部门逐步实行自筹自用投资基金
    新华社柏林１月１４日电  （记者王德峰）民主德国决定从１９９０年起，除大约３００个对国民经济发展具有重大影响的大型投资项目之外，在生产性国民经济各部门逐步实行企业自筹自用投资基金的新的投资政策。
    这是民主德国根据本国的具体情况，在经济领域采取的一项重大措施。
    据报道，７０年代以来，民主德国的工业投资逐渐减少，１９７０年国家用于生产性经济部门的投资还占整个国民收入的１６％，１９８８年下降到了１０％以下。这种投资政策，使工业设备更新和现代化技术改造的速度放慢，生产不出足够数量的在国内外市场上具有竞争力的产品。１９８５年以后两德贸易呈现停滞乃至下降的趋势，原因之一就在这里。
    鉴于这种情况，民主德国于１９８８年在全国１６家联合企业实行扩大企业自筹自用投资基金比例的试点。现在又在总结这些企业经验的基础上，决定把这种新的投资办法，作为企业解决扩大再生产投资基金问题的发展方向。
    迄今为止，企业的投资基金主要来自国家预算，其次才是纯利润提成和设备折旧费。新的投资政策则规定，企业扩大再生产的投资项目所需要的投资基金主要有三个来源：企业纯利润提成、设备折旧费和企业向银行的贷款。这样，经营好的企业会获得更多的纯利润，可在完成国家上交纯利润指标外拿出更多的钱来用于扩大再生产。
    据报道，去年实施的新的投资政策表明，这样做能鼓励企业精打细算，注意改善投入和产出的关系，注意提高投资效益，更积极地走集约化道路。
