Gu Mu, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said on January 8 while visiting the Tianjin Economic and Technological Development Zone that developing the zone has opened a new path and proven the correctness of the reform and opening-up policy.

On the morning of January 8, Gu Mu listened to a report by Yi Disheng, Director of the Tianjin Development Zone Management Committee, on the situation of the three types of foreign-invested enterprises. He also visited several joint ventures and gave positive comments on the work of the development zone. Gu Mu said that in the past, people complained about our investment environment, but now, through our efforts, the investment environment has greatly improved, and they are more satisfied. Of course, we still need to continue to improve. For example, issues such as the education of foreign children and the cultural life of foreign businesspeople need to be improved.

    办好开发区为改革开放创新路
    据新华社天津讯  （记者孟子君）全国政协副主席谷牧１月８日在天津经济技术开发区参观时说，办好开发区的意义在于走出了一条新路，证明了改革开放政策的正确。
    ８日上午，谷牧听取了天津开发区管委会主任叶迪生有关开办三资企业项目的情况汇报，参观了几家合资企业，对开发区的工作做出了好评。谷牧说，过去人家嫌我们投资环境不好，现在通过我们的努力，投资环境大大改善，他们也就比较满意了。当然我们还要继续努力改进。譬如外国儿童上学问题，外商业余文化生活问题等等，都需要加以改善。
