The Guangzhou College of Traditional Chinese Medicine Affiliated Hospital and the Guangzhou Traditional Chinese Medicine Factory have jointly developed a traditional Chinese medicine powder known as "Ningxue San." This medicine is used to treat upper gastrointestinal bleeding and can completely stop bleeding in just over four days, with a cure rate of 90.3%. It also shows significant effectiveness in treating functional uterine bleeding, hemoptysis caused by bronchiectasis and inflammation, and other emergencies.

Ningxue San is formulated with herbs such as Ziziphus jujuba and Polygonatum officinale, and has the effects of clearing heat, cooling blood, invigorating blood, and astringing to stop bleeding. In the treatment of 124 cases of functional uterine bleeding, the total effective rate was 82.76%. In the treatment of 70 cases of hemoptysis caused by bronchiectasis, tuberculosis, and pulmonary inflammation, the total effective rate was 97.5%.
