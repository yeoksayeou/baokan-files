The national energy work conference requires overcoming energy tightness difficulties and ensuring that railways transport more coal and power plants generate more electricity.

	Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 20th: Correspondents Liu Xianyang and Zhang Heping report that Vice Premier Zhou Jiaxuan said at the national energy work conference, which opened today, that in order to alleviate the tight supply of energy, especially electricity, the current priority is to make the existing power plants run better, take measures to increase the production and transportation of coal. He emphasized that all regions and departments should consider the overall situation of the country, strengthen coordination, and ensure that railways transport more coal and power plants generate more electricity.

	At this critical moment when the energy situation is severe and the supply-demand contradiction is fully tense, the national energy work conference, approved by the State Council and jointly convened by the State Planning Commission and the Ministry of Energy, to discuss the overall situation of energy development, has attracted attention from all sides.

	In 1988, the total energy production in the country reached 920 million standard tons of coal, an increase of about 2% over 1987. Raw coal, oil, natural gas, and electricity all completed and exceeded the national plan. However, due to the overheating of the economy, the supply of energy, especially electricity, is currently fully tense nationwide.

	Zhou Jiaxuan said that to alleviate the current electricity shortage, coal, electricity, and transportation must be considered comprehensively. For coal used in power generation, it should be supplied according to the plan, and measures such as "regional balance, designated supply, and variety adjustment" should be taken to reduce long-distance railway transportation as much as possible. He said that the State Council has decided to establish a coordination leading group headed by Vice Chairman Ye Qing of the State Planning Commission to strengthen the dispatch of coal, electricity, and transportation nationwide. To increase the transportation of coal for electricity, the state has recently taken measures to utilize the newly opened Daqin Railway to transport more coal from Shanxi in every possible way, and plans to organize a fleet by the transportation department to pull coal from Qinhuangdao to alleviate the current power supply tension in the eastern and southern regions.

	When talking about the medium-term development strategy of the energy industry, Zhou Jiaxuan proposed that the development of energy should be adapted to the development of the national economy. When considering the speed of economic development, the speed of energy development must be considered. The development of coal, oil, electricity, and nuclear power should be coordinated. In terms of electricity, as much as possible, pithead power plants should be built to solve the problem of coal transportation. Accelerate the construction of thermal power, vigorously strengthen the development of water resources, and develop large, medium, and small hydropower stations in combination. Steadily develop nuclear power.

	Zhou Jiaxuan emphasized that the development of energy, in addition to the efforts of the functional departments of the State Council responsible for energy management, also requires everyone to work together, and the central and local governments to work together. Including the energy sector, all departments must take energy conservation as a major issue, conserve coal, electricity, and oil, and strive to make breakthroughs in energy conservation.

	Minister of Energy Huang Yicheng gave a speech entitled "Implementing the Spirit of the Third Plenary Session, Mobilizing the Enthusiasm of All Sides, and Promoting the Reform and Development of the Energy Industry."

　　全国能源工作会议要求克服能源紧张困难    
    力保铁路多运煤电厂多发电
    本报北京１月２０日讯  记者刘燮阳、张何平报道：国务委员邹家华在今天开幕的全国能源工作会议上说，为了缓解能源尤其是电力供应的紧张状况，当前首先要使现有电站更好地运行起来，采取措施，增加煤炭的运输和生产。他强调，各地区、各部门要从全国大局出发，加强调度，力保铁路多运煤，电厂多发电。
    在当前能源形势严峻，供需矛盾全面紧张的时刻，经国务院批准、由国家计委和能源部联合召开的全国能源工作会议，共商能源发展大计，引起各方面的关注。
    １９８８年，全国能源生产总量达到９．２亿吨标准煤，比１９８７年增长２％左右。原煤、石油和天然气、发电量等都完成和超额完成了国家计划。但是，由于经济过热，目前全国能源尤其是电力供应出现全面紧张。
    邹家华说，为缓解当前电力紧张的矛盾，煤、电、运三者必须综合统盘考虑。对发电用煤要按计划供应，并采取“地区平衡、定点供应、品种调剂”的办法，尽量减少铁路长途运输。他说，国务院已决定成立一个由国家计委副主任叶青任组长的煤、电、运协调领导小组，以加强全国煤炭、电力和运输的调度。为增加电力用煤运输，最近国家还采取措施，利用已开通的大秦铁路，想方设法从山西多运出一些煤炭，拟由交通部门组织船队到秦皇岛拉煤，以缓解目前华东、华南地区的供电紧张局面。
    在谈到能源工业近中期发展战略时，邹家华提出，能源的发展要同国民经济的发展相适应，考虑经济发展的速度时，一定要考虑能源的发展速度。煤、油、电、核的发展要协调。电力上，尽量建设坑口电站，解决好煤炭运输。加快火电建设，大力加强水力资源的开发，大、中、小水电站结合发展。稳步发展核电。
    邹家华强调，能源的发展除国务院管理能源的职能部门努力外，还需要大家来办，中央和地方联合来办。包括能源部门在内的一切部门都要把节约能源作为大问题来抓，节煤、节电、节油，力争在节能上有所突破。
    能源部长黄毅诚在会上作了《贯彻三中全会精神，调动各方面积极性，大力推进能源工业的改革和发展》的讲话。
