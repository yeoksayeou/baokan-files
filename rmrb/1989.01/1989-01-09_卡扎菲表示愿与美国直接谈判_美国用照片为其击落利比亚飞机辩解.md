Libyan leader Gaddafi today called for direct negotiations with the United States over the chemical factory dispute.

Gaddafi emphasized to the news media in the Libyan capital, "The United States must understand that its policy of surrounding us and using force against us will absolutely not succeed."

According to the Libyan News Agency, Gaddafi said, "Libya does not heed force; it only heeds direct negotiations." Gaddafi hopes to negotiate with the incoming new U.S. government.

He insisted that the chemical factory, located 96 kilometers southwest of Tripoli, will only produce medicines. The United States, however, claims that it is a chemical weapons factory. The dispute over whether it is a chemical factory or a chemical weapons factory has further strained U.S.-Libyan relations.

The United States submitted two photographs to the Security Council to prove that the two Libyan fighter jets shot down by U.S. planes on the 4th were carrying air-to-air missiles.

Walters, the U.S. permanent representative to the United Nations, stated during the second day of debate on the issue at the Security Council, "The pilots' conversation recordings and these two photographs more clearly show that the United States took self-defense actions."

However, Libyan Ambassador Montasser told reporters after the meeting that the photographs provided by the United States were "completely fabricated."

Montasser also said that the United States deliberately provoked this incident to find an excuse to attack Libya.

Walters told reporters after the meeting that the photographs show that the Libyan planes were carrying four missiles.

The United States insists that the action taken against the Libyan planes was self-defense, while Libya insists that their planes were unarmed.

　　卡扎菲表示愿与美国直接谈判
    美国用照片为其击落利比亚飞机辩解
    新华社开罗１月７日电  利比亚领导人卡扎菲今天呼吁同美国就化工厂争端举行直接谈判。
    卡扎菲在利比亚首都向新闻界强调说：“美国必须懂得，它包围我们，用武力反对我们的政策绝对不会得逞”。
    据利比亚通讯社报道，卡扎菲说，利比亚不理睬武力，只理睬直接谈判。卡扎菲寄希望于同即将上任的美国新政府举行谈判。
    他坚持说，位于的黎波里西南９６公里的一家化工厂将只制造药品。美国则声称，这是一家化学武器工厂。是化工厂还是化学武器工厂的争端使美利关系又趋紧张。
    新华社联合国１月６日电　美国常驻联合国代表沃尔特斯今天向安理会递交了两张照片，以表明４日被美国飞机击落的两架利比亚战斗机携带空对空导弹。
    沃尔特斯在安理会就此事进行的第２天辩论中称，“飞行员的谈话录音和这两幅照片更加清楚地表明美国采取的是自卫行动。”
    然而，利比亚大使蒙塔塞尔在会后对记者说，美国提供的照片“完全是伪造的”。
    蒙塔塞尔还说，美国故意挑起这一事件目的在于为进攻利比亚寻找借口。
    沃尔特斯会后对记者说，照片表明利比亚飞机携带着４枚导弹。
    美国坚持认为对利飞机采取的是自卫行动，而利比亚则坚持说他们的飞机没有武器。
