	Pressuring Long-Term Projects, Extending Short-Term Ones, Boldly Tilting, and Abandoning Inferior Products to Preserve Superior Ones
	The Path to Curbing Economic Overheating Becomes Clearer
	The Current Prominent Issue is That What Should Be Pressured Is Not Being Pressured Down, and What Should Be Preserved Is Not Being Preserved

	People's Daily reports: Correspondent Línɡ Zhìjūn comments: The guiding ideology for curbing economic overheating in 1989 has become clear, and the measures are gradually becoming more complete. This can be summarized as firmly compressing the scale overall, boldly implementing a tilted policy in specific steps, pressuring "long legs" and extending "short legs," abandoning inferior products to preserve superior ones, using the optimization of the economic structure to promote effective supply, and thereby achieving the goals of stabilizing the market and increasing fiscal revenue.

	In the 1989 that has just begun, two noteworthy trends have emerged in China's economic situation. First, after more than three months of scale compression, what should be pressured is still not being pressured down. The most prominent manifestation is that the scale of fixed asset investment is still too large, and the long-term projects are still too long. The most pressured regions have only reduced by 6%, while some regions have only reduced by 1%. On the other hand, what should be preserved has not been preserved. The most prominent manifestation is that the production of energy and raw materials has become even tighter. In the last two months of last year, the growth in electricity generation was significantly lower than in the previous 10 months. Due to power shortages, factories in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Liaoning, Jiangsu, and other places have had to operate for only five days a week and shut down for two or three days. Among the main raw materials and agricultural support products such as fertilizers, most have seen slowed growth or even reduced production. Some provincial and municipal planning department officials analyzed that, given the current situation, there is a possibility of production slippage.

	In recent interviews with various parties, the reporter has felt that this round of compression differs significantly from the 1985 tightening. The most significant difference is that from top to bottom, people have become aware earlier of the danger of "stagflation." How to press down what should be pressured and preserve what should be preserved? How to both tighten and not stagnate? Is controlling inflation simply about suppressing consumption? Is rectification and order simply about retreating? If it is not just about retreating, where can we advance? Over the past month, a series of important meetings have been seeking answers to such questions, including the National Planning Conference, the Economic System Reform Work Conference, the Fiscal Work Conference, and the Fourth Session of the State Council. Although the content of these meetings varies, they share a common and significant theme: exploring the best path for curbing economic overheating nationwide in 1989.

	The current approach, which involves firmly compressing the scale overall and implementing a tilted policy in specific steps to optimize the industrial structure and increase effective supply, has further clarified the general policy of rectification and order proposed by the Party Central Committee more than three months ago. When the work of cleaning up and compressing began last autumn, people thought of quickly removing the inflamed appendix, and various places implemented uniform tightening measures, freezing total wages, credit, and investment authority, known as the "three freezes." The positive results were that more than 30 billion yuan of fixed asset investment projects were compressed, and overheated industries began to cool down, with average monthly output falling. At the same time, negative impacts emerged: while long-term industries were shortened, short-term industries were also cut short, and both excellent factories and poor-quality factories entered one of the most difficult periods in recent years, affecting effective supply. At this point, people began to discuss that the surgery was necessary, but they must not cut out the good intestines while removing the appendix. To reverse this situation, in December, General Secretary Zhào Zǐyánɡ and Premier Lǐ Péng repeatedly pointed out that compressing the scale should focus on adjusting the economic structure. The core of this idea is to implement a tilted industrial policy, firmly pressuring what should be pressured and preserving what should be preserved, rather than implementing a one-size-fits-all approach. Large and medium-sized enterprises under the contract responsibility system began to fulfill contracts linking total wages with economic benefits. Bank credit in short-term industries such as energy and raw materials began to relax. The state's 1989 plan for agricultural investment not only did not compress but significantly increased. In early January, the State Council issued two urgent notices in three days, deciding to stop and clean up fixed asset investment projects in nine situations by the 10th and to prioritize ensuring the energy, raw materials, and funds needed for fertilizer production, enabling enterprises to operate at full capacity. This is a specific step in implementing the policy of pressuring long-term projects and extending short-term ones. This shows that optimization and compression do not present an insoluble contradiction.

	Linking tightening with optimizing the economic structure is a significant progress in rectification and order. This path is creating a "forced" situation in the industrial production sector. Those who do not firmly "press long" and "abandon inferior" will find it difficult to "extend short" and "preserve superior." In recent days, the textile, light, and machinery industries have simultaneously decided on the 1989 industrial tilted policy: firmly stopping a batch of outdated and backward equipment, pressuring long-term and inferior products, and concentrating material and financial resources on key industries and products with significant market gaps. Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Jiangsu, and other provinces and municipalities have taken specific measures to preserve superior products and abandon inferior ones, increasing effective supply. Among these, Shanghai analyzed and ranked 560 key and short-term products in the city, identifying 21 daily consumer goods as the "shortest of the short" and the "best of the best," mobilizing limited funds, raw materials, and energy to give these products the green light for production. Currently, the commercial procurement of these products is on an upward trend.

	The hope for successfully curbing economic overheating lies in whether the economic structure can be optimized. However, China's economic structure is imbalanced and difficult to reverse. There are signs that the difficulties in adjustment are greater than anticipated. In the aspects of "pressing" and "preserving," the current "pressing" work is more difficult and more urgent.

　　压长伸短　大胆倾斜　舍劣保优    
    遏制经济过热的路子渐趋明朗    
    当前突出的问题是该压的压不下该保的保不住
    本报讯  记者凌志军评述：１９８９年遏制经济过热的指导思想已经明朗，措施渐趋完善。这可以概括为，在总体上坚定地压缩规模，在具体步骤上大胆贯彻倾斜政策，压“长腿”伸“短腿”，舍劣品保优品，以经济结构的优化推动有效供给，进而达到稳定市场，增加财政收入的目的。
    在刚刚开始的１９８９年，我国的经济形势中出现了两种值得注意的动向。首先是经过３个多月的压缩规模，该压的至今压不住。其突出的表现是固定资产投资规模仍然太大，长线仍然太长。各地压得最多的不过６％，而有的地区仅压了１％。另一方面，该保的没有保住。其突出的表现是，能源、原材料生产进一步紧张。去年后两个月发电量增长明显低于前１０个月。由于缺电，上海、广州、辽宁、江苏等地工厂只能每星期开五停二、开四停三。主要原材料产品和化肥等支农紧缺产品中，大部分增长放慢甚至减产。一些省市计划部门的负责同志分析，按目前情况，有可能会出现生产滑坡的危险。
    记者近日在对各方面的采访中感到，这一次压缩与１９８５年的紧缩有一个很大的不同点，就是从上到下都较早地意识到“滞胀”的危险。如何把该压的压住，把该保的保住？如何既紧缩又不停滞？控制通货膨胀就是单纯地抑制消费吗？治理整顿就是简单地退却吗？如果不只是退却，又可以在什么地方前进？对于诸如此类的问题，一个多月来一系列重大会议都在寻求答案，其中包括全国计划会议、经济体制改革工作会议、财政工作会议和第四次国务院全体会议。这些会议的内容虽各有侧重，但其中有一个共同的意义重大的主题：探寻１９８９年全国遏制经济过热的最佳途径。
    　现在所形成的路子，即在总体上坚定地压缩规模，在具体步骤上贯彻倾斜政策，优化产业结构，增加有效供给，使三个多月前党中央提出的治理、整顿的总方针进一步明朗。当去年秋季清理、压缩的工作刚刚展开的时候，人们想的是尽快地割去发炎的阑尾，全国各地实行了一律的紧缩措施，工资总额冻结、信贷冻结和投资权的冻结，人称“三个冻结”，其积极的成果是，压缩了总计３００多亿元的固定资产投资项目，过热的工业开始降温，平均月产值回落。与此同时，消极影响也显露出来：在长腿产业缩短的同时，短腿产业也被削短，优秀工厂和劣质工厂的生产同样进入近几年来最困难的时期，有效供给受到冲击。这时候人们开始议论，手术非作不可，但千万不要在割阑尾的时候把好肠子也割去。为了扭转这种局面，１２月份，赵紫阳总书记和李鹏总理多次指出，压缩规模着重在调整经济结构上下功夫。这一思想的核心是实行倾斜的产业政策，坚决压住该压的、保住该保的，而不是搞一刀切。实行承包制的大中企业开始兑现工资总额与经济效益挂钩的合同。银行信贷在能源、原材料等短腿产业领域开始松动。国家１９８９年计划内对农业的投资不仅没有压缩，而且大大增长。１月上旬，国务院在三天内连续发出两个紧急通知，前者决定对９种情况的固定资产投资项目于１０日前一律停工清理；后者决定优先保证化肥生产所需的能源、原材料和资金，使企业满负荷生产。这正是贯彻压长伸短方针的具体步骤。这表明优化与压缩二者之间并不存在无法解决的矛盾。
    把紧缩同优化经济结构联系在一起是治理整顿的一大进步。这条路在工业生产领域中正造成一种“逼上梁山”的态势。谁不坚决“压长”、“舍劣”，谁就难以“伸短”、“保优”。近几日纺织工业、轻工业和机电工业，不约而同地决定了１９８９年的产业倾斜政策：坚决停掉一批陈旧落后设备，压住长线、低劣产品，集中物力、财力用于市场缺口较大的重点行业和产品。北京、上海、天津、江苏等省市的工业生产均采取了保优舍劣，增加有效供给的具体措施。其中上海对全市５６０种重点产品和短线产品分析排列，确定２１种日用消费品为“短中之短”、“优中之优”，动员有限资金、原材料、能源为这些商品的生产开绿灯。目前这些产品的商业收购已呈上升趋势。
    遏制经济过热的成功的希望在于经济结构能否优化。但我国经济结构失衡积重难返，有迹象表明，调整的困难比预料的多。在“压”和“保”这两个方面，当前“压”的工作更加困难，也更加紧迫。
