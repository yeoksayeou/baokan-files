The Italian newspaper *Corriere della Sera* noted that Italian consumers' attitudes are changing. In the 1987 Christmas season, people sought "luxury," but in 1988, they prioritized "practicality."

Christmas is the most important holiday for Italians and is closely followed by New Year's Day. Therefore, December is the busiest month for the market. Stores extend their operating hours, and customers flock in. Statistics show that Italians spend about 30 trillion lire (approximately $23.6 billion) in this single month.

A sociologist observed that after the period of consumerism, people's consumption concepts have matured. Practicality, simplicity, and necessity have become the main criteria for choosing products. The previous obsession with "luxury" is gradually fading. He also mentioned that some high-end branded clothing often ends up locked in wardrobes because there are few occasions to wear them. The large department store "La Rinascente," which has over 500 sales outlets nationwide, also noted that customers no longer emphasize the brand of clothing but focus on practicality and quality.

For example, with increasing traffic congestion and difficulty finding parking spots in cities, people are beginning to feel that cars are becoming a "burden." In summary, people have realized that pursuing impractical items can be detrimental to life.

In the realm of household appliances, products with multiple functions, ease of use, and versatility are highly favored by customers.

Toys are another category with significant sales during the holiday season. Sociologists suggest changing the perception of toys as mere gifts and instead using them to develop children's intelligence.

### 从“奢华”到“实用”

　　从“奢华”到“实用”
    本报记者  史克栋
    意大利《新闻报》在谈到意大利人１９８８年圣诞节和元旦期间购置“年货”时认为，意大利人的消费观正在发生变化，前年圣诞节期间购物时，人们追求的是“奢华”，而去年，则更注重“实用性”。
    圣诞节是意大利人一年当中最重要的节日且与元旦只隔几天，所以１２月份是市场最繁荣的１个月。商店都延长了营业时间，顾客熙熙攘攘。据统计，仅这一个月，意大利人就要花掉３０万亿里拉（约合２３６亿美元）。
    一位社会学家发现，经历了前些年的消费主义时期之后，人们的消费观念已趋成熟。实用、简单、必要成了人们选择商品的主要标准。前些年那种追求“奢华”的观念，在渐渐淡薄。他还说，事实上，一些名牌高档服装常常被锁在衣柜里，因为用得着这种服装的场合实在太少。大型百货公司“复兴商场”在全国设有５００多处销售点，它的营业人员也注意到，顾客不再“着重服装的名牌，而是讲究实用、质好”。
    再如汽车，由于车辆日益拥挤，市内找到停车位困难，人们开始感到汽车快要成为一种“累赘”。总之，人们意识到，过分追求不实用的东西有害于生活。
    另外，在家用电器方面，功能多，使用方便，用途大的产品倍受顾客的青睐。
    儿童玩具是过节时销售量较大的商品。社会学家认为，应改变只把玩具当作礼品的观念，使玩具能起到开发儿童智力的作用。
