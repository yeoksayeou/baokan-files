The China Democratic League has adopted a new constitution with the guiding principle of promoting democracy and science and strengthening party functions.

	The new constitution of the China Democratic League stipulates that the current tasks of the League are: under the banner of patriotism and socialism, to unite intellectuals, uphold democracy and science, dedicate to reform and opening up, and strive for national reunification, national rejuvenation, and the building of a prosperous, democratic, and civilized modernized country. The constitution states: the League reflects the scientific beliefs of intellectuals, represents the democratic demands of intellectuals, and safeguards the legitimate rights and interests of its members. The state must guarantee the rights of intellectuals to contribute their talents to society through labor and receive reasonable remuneration; to research, explore, and innovate according to scientific laws; to choose their profession and move rationally; to receive continuing education; and to rest and treat to ensure health.

	The revised constitution of the China Democratic League clearly proposes that the chairman and vice-chairmen of the Central Committee shall not serve more than two consecutive terms. During the discussion of the constitution, many representatives believed that this not only breaks the lifetime tenure system but also lays the foundation for the youth of the leadership team. The local organizations' chairmen and vice-chairmen should also have corresponding regulations. The constitution adopted today accepts this suggestion from the representatives and adds the clause: "chairmen and vice-chairmen shall not serve more than two consecutive terms."

　　九三学社通过新章程
    以弘扬民主和科学传统强化政党功能为指导思想
    本报北京１月５日讯  以弘扬民主和科学传统、强化政党功能为指导思想的《九三学社章程》修改草案今天已经通过。
    新的九三学社章程规定该社现阶段的任务是：在爱国主义和社会主义的旗帜下，广泛团结知识界人士，坚持民主和科学，致力于改革开放，为统一祖国，振兴中华，使我国成为富强、民主、文明的现代化国家而奋斗。章程指出：本社反映知识分子的科学信念，代表知识分子的民主要求，维护社员的合法权益。国家必须保障知识分子通过劳动为社会贡献才智并获得合理报酬的权利；按照科学规律研究、探索和创新的权利；选择职业、合理流动的权利；接受继续教育的权利；休息治疗以保障健康的权利。
    修改后的九三学社社章明确提出：中央委员会的主席、副主席连续任职不得超过两届。在讨论社章过程中，有不少代表认为，这不仅打破了终身制，也为领导班子年轻化奠定了基础，地方组织的主任委员、副主任委员也应有相应的规定。今天通过的章程接受了代表的这个建议，增写了“主任委员、副主任委员连续任职不得超过两届”一款。
