One day, villagers Du Fei and seven others from Tangjiaping Township in Changde County, Hunan Province, were helping Gao Heqing build a new house. Gao asked Du Fei and the others to carry a section of paulownia wood into the workshop for processing. The wood weighed about 150 kilograms. Du Fei, who was 43 years old, said nonchalantly, "No need to carry it, I can shoulder it myself!" Yang Huapeng and the others said, "You're getting older, it's risky to shoulder it alone." Du Fei ignored their advice and repeatedly urged Yang and the others to lift the wood onto his shoulder. Yang and four others, seeing Du Fei's confidence, thought nothing would go wrong and together lifted the round log onto Du Fei's left shoulder, adjusting the position. However, they still felt uneasy and did not dare to let go. Du Fei loudly urged them to step back. Seeing Du Fei's even more confident demeanor, Yang and the others no longer doubted anything would happen, so they let go. As soon as they let go, there was a loud crash, and Du Fei, along with the wood, fell to the ground. The round log rolled over his head to the ground, and Du Fei immediately vomited blood and died without a sound. Afterward, Du Fei's two sons demanded that Yang Huapeng and the other five compensate for the funeral expenses. Yang and the others refused to compensate, arguing that the harm was caused by Du Fei's own recklessness and had nothing to do with them. Du Fei's two sons then took the case to the county People's Court.

The court ruled that the deceased, Du Fei, had no intent to harm himself, and the five defendants had no intent to harm Du Fei. Both parties had a negligent mental state regarding the occurrence of the harm. Du Fei, as an adult, had full capacity for action and should have been able to foresee that the wood was too heavy for one person to carry. However, he ignored the warnings and insisted that the five defendants lift the wood onto his shoulder, leading to the tragedy. This was a case of overconfidence leading to negligence. The five defendants were also fully capable of civil conduct. Due to their belief that Du Fei could carry the wood without incident, they carried the wood onto his shoulder and let go, resulting in harm. Both the five defendants and Du Fei himself were at fault and should share the civil liability. Du Fei's negligent behavior causing economic loss should not be transferred to the five defendants without legal basis. The five defendants should only bear the portion of civil liability they are responsible for.

In terms of the degree of fault between Du Fei and the five defendants, it is clear that Du Fei's fault was greater. Therefore, based on the General Principles of Civil Law's Article 106, Paragraph 2, "Citizens and legal persons who, due to negligence, cause damage to the property of the state, collective, or individuals, shall bear civil liability," Article 119, "Those who infringe upon the body of a citizen...causing death, shall also pay funeral expenses," and Article 131, "If the victim also has fault in the occurrence of the damage, the civil liability of the infringer can be reduced," the court mediated the case and reached the following agreement: The five defendants will compensate 30% of the funeral expenses, and the remaining amount will be borne by the plaintiffs.

　　逞能杀身，协助者有无责任？
    一天，湖南省常德县唐家铺乡村民杜飞等七人给高和清家帮忙建新房。高叫杜飞等人将一截泡桐抬进工棚加工。泡桐重１５０公斤左右。杜满不在乎地说：“不用抬，我一个人扛去！”杨化培等人说：“你上了年纪（４３岁），蛮扛会出事的。”杜不听，连连催促杨等抬木上肩。杨等五人见杜飞把握十足，心想可能不会出事，便共同把圆木抬上杜的左肩，调好位置。但他们仍不放心，不敢松手。杜大声催促他们离开。杨等见杜语气更有信心，不再怀疑会出事，便松了手。刚一松手，只听“咣当”一声，杜飞连人带木栽倒在地，圆木从他左肩越过头顶滚到地上，杜当即口吐鲜血，一声未吭就死了。事后，杜飞的两个儿子要求杨化培等五人赔偿丧葬费用。杨等以损害事实是由杜飞逞能造成的，与他们无关为由，拒绝赔偿。杜的两个儿子诉诸县人民法院。
    法院审理认为：死者杜飞没有自伤故意，五被告也没有损害杜飞人身的故意，双方对损害结果的发生都持过失心理状态。杜飞作为成年人，具有完全行为能力，应当而且能够预见圆木是一个人扛不起的。但却不听劝阻，要五被告给其抬木上肩，造成惨祸。这是一种过于自信的过失。五名被告也都是具有完全民事行为能力的人，由于轻信杜扛木不会出事，实施了抬木上肩和松手行为，以致出现损害后果。五被告和杜飞本人都有过错，应该共同承担民事责任。杜飞生前的过错行为所造成的经济损失，转嫁给五被告没有法律根据，五被告只承担其应承担的那部分民事责任。
    从杜飞与五被告的过错大小程度看，很明显，杜飞的过错大于五被告。因此，法院根据民法通则第１０６条第２款“公民、法人由于过错侵害国家的、集体的财产，侵害他人财产、人身的，应当承担民事责任”、第１１９条“侵害公民身体……造成死亡的，并应当支付丧葬费……”、第１３１条“受害人对于损害的发生也有过错的，可以减轻侵害人的民事责任”等规定，对本案进行调解，达成如下协议：由五被告赔偿３０％的丧葬费，其余由原告承担。
