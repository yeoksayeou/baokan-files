	More than ten thousand amateur cultural relics protection officers have become valuable assistants to cultural relics departments at various levels in Zhejiang Province in protecting cultural relics and heritage, and in combating theft and smuggling activities. Over the past two years, they have established cultural relics protection groups in more than four hundred villages across the province and have raised over 30 million yuan to repair and protect a number of cultural relics.

	Zhejiang Province is rich in cultural relics and heritage sites, but due to insufficient funding and manpower in cultural relics departments, it is difficult for cultural relics protection units to carry out protection and repair work. Theft and smuggling of cultural relics also occur from time to time. Since 1981, amateur cultural relics protection officers have emerged in various parts of the province. They are either respected elderly farmers, village teachers, or young militia members in the area. After receiving short-term training from cultural relics departments, they have mastered basic knowledge of cultural relics identification and repair. In Yuhang County, there are famous "Liangzhu Culture" sites. Last year, the county established 25 village cultural relics protection groups, ensuring that every township has a cultural relics protection group and every village has a cultural relics protection officer in areas with a high concentration of cultural relics. This has effectively curbed the smuggling of cultural relics.

　　浙江出现万名业余文物保护员    
    分布四百个乡村打击偷盗走私文物活动
    新华社杭州一月二十二日电（实习生慎海雄）一万多名业余文物保护员已成为浙江省各级文物部门保护文物遗产、打击偷盗走私活动的得力助手。两年多来，他们在全省四百个乡村建立了文物保护小组，并自筹资金三千多万元，维修和保护了一批文物。
    浙江现存的文物遗址十分丰富，但由于文物部门经费不足、人力有限，文保单位的保护和维修困难较多，盗掘和走私文物的情况也屡有发生。从一九八一年开始，全省各地陆续出现了一批业余义务文保员。他们有的是当地德高望重的老农民，有的是乡村教师或青年民兵。他们经过文物部门的短期培训，初步掌握了文物的鉴别、维修等基础知识。余杭县境内有著名的“良渚文化”遗址，去年这个县建立乡村文保小组二十五个，在文物密集区做到了“乡乡有文保组、村村有文保员”，有效地制止了文物走私活动。
