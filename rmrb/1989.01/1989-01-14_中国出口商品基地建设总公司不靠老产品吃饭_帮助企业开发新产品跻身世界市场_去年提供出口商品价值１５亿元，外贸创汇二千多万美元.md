China Export Commodities Base Construction Corporation does not rely on old products for survival. It helps enterprises develop new products and enter the world market. Last year, it provided export commodities valued at 1.5 billion yuan, earning over 20 million US dollars in foreign exchange.

	According to a report by our reporter Lu Zhenhua, by the end of last year, China Export Commodities Base Construction Corporation had established 356 joint ventures and over 50 Sino-foreign joint ventures across the country. They collaborate to develop high-tech products and enter the global market. In 1988, they provided export commodities worth 1.5 billion yuan, which is 13 times the amount in 1983. They also earned over 20 million US dollars in foreign exchange in 1988. The first and second generations of pollen extract products, Changzhou Jinshi brand bicycles, and crystalline silicon from Mingfu Silicon Industry Co., Ltd. have all become new stars in China's export commodities.

	For a long time, China's foreign trade and production sectors have been separated, causing many problems. This company took swift action, using methods such as equity participation and joint ventures, to carry out extensive economic and technological cooperation. They developed a batch of high-quality, new, and unique export products. The largest export factory for gabardine in China, the First Weaving Mill in Yingkou, was originally a technologically backward collective small factory that could only produce low-quality gabardine. After merging with the Construction Corporation in 1982, the company leveraged its comprehensive operational advantages, using loans and leasing methods to introduce advanced technology and equipment three times. This transformed the mill into the top in the industry in terms of equipment, product quality, and economic benefits. A Czech businessman, upon seeing the gabardine produced by the mill, exclaimed, "It's top-notch." Now, the mill's products are in high demand, with a Hong Kong businessman requesting a 5 to 10-year exclusive sales contract. Last year, the mill earned over 10 million US dollars in foreign exchange.

	When the "Jinshi" bicycle first hit the market, consumers were skeptical. A store selling it at a discount only had three customers inquire about it in a day. However, today's "Jinshi" has 8 series and over 80 varieties, with an annual production of 2 million units. It is not only popular across the country but also exported to over 30 countries and regions, including West Germany and Italy, with market demand several times the company's production capacity. What was the turning point for "Jinshi"? It was the merger between "Jinshi" Factory and the Construction Corporation in 1981. With a new development concept, they used "Jinshi" as the flagship, attracting 168 enterprises and research institutions nationwide to form the "Jinshi" Limited Company. This way, "Jinshi" initially formed a complete system for product development, production, and sales, accelerating its entry into the global market.

	The key to expanding export products is to break away from the low-level repetition of relying on old products and move towards high-level development focused on developing high-tech and new products. The leadership and staff of the Base Construction Corporation timely seized the opportunity of recent changes in the international market. They fully leveraged local resource advantages to develop technology-intensive and new export commodities. They collaborated with Zhejiang Research Institute and the Medical Department to successfully develop the first and second generations of pollen extract products, opening up the overseas market. They also established factories overseas, utilizing overseas information, technology, and raw material advantages to produce new foreign exchange-earning products. Recently, a joint venture bicycle factory established overseas by the Construction Corporation received orders for over 500,000 units within a few months.

### 中国出口商品基地建设总公司不靠老产品吃饭  帮助企业开发新产品跻身世界市场  去年提供出口商品价值１５亿元，外贸创汇二千多万美元

　　中国出口商品基地建设总公司不靠老产品吃饭
    帮助企业开发新产品跻身世界市场
    去年提供出口商品价值１５亿元，外贸创汇二千多万美元
    本报讯  记者陆振华报道：中国出口商品基地建设总公司到去年底已在全国各地建起联营企业３５６家，中外合资企业５０多家。他们联合开发高科技产品，跻身世界市场。１９８８年提供出口商品１５亿元人民币，相当于１９８３年的１３倍，还在１９８８年的外贸经营中创汇２０００多万美元。它扶植起来的花粉素第一代和第二代产品、常州金狮牌自行车、明孚硅业有限公司的结晶硅等，都已成为我国出口商品中的新星。
    我国外贸和生产部门长期分割，弊病很大。这家公司迅速行动起来，采用参股、合营等方式，开展广泛的经济技术合作，发展了一批名、优、新、特出口产品。全国最大的坚固呢出口专厂营口市第一织布厂，原来是个技术落后的集体小厂，只能生产低质量的坚固呢。１９８２年和建设总公司合营以后，公司发挥综合经营的优势，运用贷款、租赁方式，先后３次为企业引进先进技术和设备，使该厂在同行业中一跃成为设备、产品质量、经济效益３个第一流。一位捷克厂商一看该厂生产的坚固呢就高兴地说：“是上等货。”现在，该厂的产品供不应求，有位港商要求签订５年至１０年的包销合同。去年全厂创汇超过１０００万美元。
    当“金狮”自行车刚面市的时候，消费者不认账。有个商店以优惠价出售，一天仅有三人来问津。然而今天的“金狮”已有８个系列８０多种花色，年产量达２００万辆，不仅畅销全国各地，还远销联邦德国、意大利等３０多个国家和地区，市场需求量是全公司生产能力的好几倍。“金狮”转机的关键是什么？就是“金狮”厂１９８１年和建设总公司合资。双方以新的发展构思，以“金狮”为龙头，先后吸收全国１６８家企业和科研单位组成“金狮”股份有限公司。这样，“金狮”便初步形成了产品开发、生产和销售完整的体系，加速了进入世界市场的步伐。
    扩大出口产品的关键，是摆脱那种靠老产品吃饭的低层次重复，向以开发高科技和新产品为主的高层次发展。基地建设总公司的领导和职工及时利用近年来国际市场变化的机遇，充分发挥各地资源优势，开发技术密集型和新的出口商品，他们和浙江科研工厂及医药部门合作，成功地开发了花粉素第一代和第二代产品，打开了国外市场。他们还把工厂办到海外，利用海外的信息、技术以及原料优势，生产新的创汇产品。不久前，建设总公司在海外办的一家合资自行车厂几个月内就接到５０多万辆的订货。
