In 1988, the Recruit stock scandal rocked the Japanese political landscape, its impact comparable to the "Lockheed" scandal of years past. Seventy-six government officials were implicated, including key figures from various factions of the Liberal Democratic Party. The Recruit incident is currently under deep investigation.

In the Japanese news of last year, Eiji Katsumata, the former chairman of the Recruit board of directors, was a notable figure. On July 6, 1988, Katsumata resigned from his position as chairman of Recruit due to the stock scandal.

Eiji Katsumata was born in Osaka City and is currently 53 years old. Both his grandfather and father were educators. Katsumata himself graduated from the Department of Education and Educational Psychology at Tokyo University in 1955 and joined the Tokyo University Press Club. After graduating in 1960, he founded the "University News Advertising Company," providing job consultation services to university students nationwide. In 1960, Japan was in the early stages of rapid economic growth, and companies were in a "labor shortage" situation. Therefore, Katsumata leveraged his company's agency contracts with the Tokyo University and Waseda University Press Clubs to secure a large number of recruitment advertisements. With virtually no competition in the industry, the business developed smoothly. Later, Katsumata compiled recruitment advertisements into books, publishing "Corporate Guide" and "Recruit (English, meaning new recruits, applicants) Guide."

In 1963, the University News Advertising Company was renamed "Japan Recruit Center," and business flourished. The term "Recruit method" even emerged in society.

In 1966, the company published the "Housing Information Weekly," transitioning from providing employment information to comprehensive information. Subsequently, it launched a women's employment magazine, providing information for women seeking career changes. In 1984, the company was renamed "Recruit Company," expanding its operations to market research and personnel placement. In 1985, it also entered the electronics and communications network business.

Today, this company, which started 28 years ago with just two employees, has grown into a large enterprise with 27 subsidiaries, annual sales of 42 billion yen, and over 9,000 employees. Recruit Company owns a building in the expensive Ginza district of Tokyo, where its headquarters is located. In the 1987 list of high-income taxpayers released by the Japanese National Tax Agency in May 1988, Katsumata was ranked 29th.

After the Recruit stock scandal broke, people wondered about the company's motives for selling stocks to political figures on such a large scale. Some believe that Recruit Company had the intention of using stocks to clear company operational obstacles and to build relationships with political figures, aiming for "spring sowing and autumn harvest." For example, Kato Takashi, former Vice Minister of Labor, who purchased Recruit's unlisted stocks, had served as the director of the Employment Stabilization Bureau. During his tenure, a draft amendment to a law proposed by the bureau included a provision that advertising media should be responsible for reviewing the authenticity of advertisements and report to the government's Employment Stabilization Bureau. If this new law were passed, advertising media would be subject to legal penalties in the event of false or illegal advertising. If advertising media conducted reviews, it would increase operational costs, threatening the company's survival. At this critical juncture for the job placement industry, the company actively lobbied the political sphere. As a result, the draft law did not include provisions to hold media responsible for publishing false advertisements.

Moreover, Recruit Company's widespread sale of unlisted stocks to political figures had strategic intentions. Some say that Recruit Company is a "worry industry" that exploits the anxiety of students and parents before job exams. At the same time, managers also feel anxious, always wanting to transition from "virtual" to "real." Katsumata Eiji believes that only by controlling real estate can one be a true businessman, and the shortcut to achieving this transformation is land. Recruit's subsidiary, Cosmos Company, is a rapidly developing real estate company. Everyone knows that in Japan, real estate operations cannot avoid dealing with politicians.

Japanese economic commentator Ichimei Kajihara believes that, like sowing seeds, Recruit Company's sale of stocks to political figures is to expect a harvest one day, bringing business opportunities to the company. Others believe that such a rapidly growing company lacks reliable relationships, so building a wide network of relationships becomes the company's largest operational strategy, and Recruit Cosmos Company's stocks are the tools for building these relationships.

It is said that Recruit Company's strategy seems to have achieved some goals, and Katsumata has become a special committee member of the Japanese government's tax system investigation committee and a member of the Ministry of Education's curriculum review committee.

After the stock scandal was exposed, the Japanese public was highly dissatisfied with Japan's money politics. The cabinet's approval rating had dropped to 35.9%. Although purchasing unlisted stocks by political figures is not illegal under securities law, it is clear that Recruit Company's low-priced sale of stocks to political figures was not without purpose. People believe that the problems revealed so far are just the tip of the iceberg, and public opinion demands that government officials who purchased such stocks in the names of secretaries and family members be held accountable for their political and moral responsibilities.

The stock scandal shook the Japanese government. In his first cabinet meeting after the reshuffle, Prime Minister Takeshita emphasized, "Currently, the most important task is to restore public trust." On New Year's Day, Takeshita told reporters that he would make this year the "year of political reform," and expressed his intention to ban donations to politicians with power and to strictly enforce penalties in this regard to restore public trust in the government.

　　江副浩正与利库路特案件
    迪文
    去年，利库路特股票丑闻震动了日本政坛，其影响所及，不亚于当年的“洛克希德”案件。涉嫌此案的有７６名政府要人，几乎包括自民党各派的实权人物。目前，利库路特事件正在深入调查之中。
    在去年日本的新闻报道中，利库路特公司董事会前会长江副浩正是一名引人注目的人物，去年７月６日，因利库路特股票事件江副辞去了该公司董事会长职务。
    江副浩正生于大阪市，现年５３岁，祖父和父亲均是教育工作者。他本人也于１９５５年考入东京大学教育系教育心理专业，并参加了东大新闻会。１９６０年大学毕业后，他创办了“大学新闻广告社”，向日本全国的大学生提供就职咨询。１９６０年正值日本高速增长初期，各企业都处于“求人难”的状态，因此，江副利用该公司与东京大学、早稻田大学的新闻会订有代理合同的优势，赢得了大量的征聘广告。在该行业中几乎没有对手，业务发展相当顺利。之后，江副又把征聘广告合订成册，出版了《企业向导》、《利库路特（英语，新兵、应征者之意）指南》等。
    １９６３年，大学新闻广告社改名为“日本利库路特中心”，生意更加兴隆。社会上甚至出现了一个新词“利库路特方式”。
    １９６６年，该公司发行了《住宅情报周刊》，从向社会提供就业情报发展到提供综合情报。之后，又创办了妇女就业杂志，为想转换职业的妇女提供情报。１９８４年，该公司更名为“利库路特公司”，经营范围，扩展到市场调查，人材斡旋等事业，１９８５年又参与电子计算机和通讯网络业务。
    今天，这家２８年前仅有两名职员的小公司已发展成拥有２７家子公司，年销售额达４２００亿日元，从业人员９０００余名的大型企业。利库路特公司在东京寸土寸金的银座有一栋大楼，其总部即设在其中。在１９８８年５月日本国税局发表的１９８７年高额纳税者名单上，江副名列第２９位。
    利库路特股票丑闻事发之后，人们不禁要问，该公司如此大规模地向政界要人兜售股票用意何在？有人认为利库路特公司既有用股票扫清公司经营障碍的用意，又有广交政界人士形成关系网，以期“春播秋收”之目的。例如，购买利库路特公司未上市股票的前劳动省次官加藤孝曾任职业安定局局长，在任期间，该局拟议制定的一项法令修正案中原有广告媒介有责任审查广告真伪，并向政府职业安定局申报备案的内容。如果这一新法案获得通过，那么一旦发生广告虚假或违法事件，广告媒介将受到法律制裁；如果广告媒介进行广告审查，则将增加经营成本，这将威胁到公司的生存。在这事关职业介绍业的荣枯兴衰之际，该公司积极向政界做工作。结果新法案草案根本未写入追究刊载虚假广告的媒介的条文。
    此外，利库路特公司向政界人物广泛兜售未上市股票还有其战略上的意图。有人说，利库路特公司是利用就职考试前子女和家长不安心理的“不安产业”。同时，经营者也感到不安，因而总是想从“虚”向“实”转变。江副浩正认为，只有掌握不动产才是真正的实业家，实现这种转变的捷径就是土地。利库路特的子公司宇宙公司就是一家迅速发展的不动产公司。人们都知道，在日本经营土地是少不了与政治家打交道的。
    日本经济评论家梶原一明认为，就像播种一样，利库路特公司向政界要人兜售股票，是期待有朝一日获得收获，给该公司带来商业机会。还有人认为，这种暴发的公司缺少牢靠的关系，因而，建立广泛的关系网就成为该公司最大的经营战略目标，而利库路特宇宙公司的股票就是广结关系网的工具。
    据说，利库路特公司的这一战略似乎达到了某些目的，江副已成为日本政府税制调查委员会特别委员和文部省教育课程审议会委员。
    股票丑闻暴露后，日本公众对日本的金钱政治极为不满。日本内阁的支持率已降低到３５．９％。虽然根据证券法律，政界要人购买未上市的股票不属于非法活动，但是显而易见，利库路特公司向政界人物低价出售股票并非没有目的。人们认为，迄今揭露出来的问题不过是冰山的一角，舆论要求追究那些以秘书和家属名义认购此类股票的政府要员的政治和道德责任。
    股票丑闻震动了日本政府，竹下首相在改组内阁后的首次内阁会议上强调说：“目前，最重要的课题是恢复国民的信赖。”今年元旦，竹下在会见记者时又表示，要把今年作为“政治改革之年”，又表示要禁止对手中有权的政治家捐款的行为，并强调要严格这方面的惩罚规则，以恢复国民对政府的信赖。
