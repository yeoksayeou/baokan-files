The second plenary session of the sixth central committee of the China Democratic League, which concluded in Beijing this morning, proposed that the League should strive to fulfill its party functions, actively participate in politics and policy-making, promote reform and the construction of socialist democratic politics, expand its involvement in the decision-making, execution, and supervision of state affairs, and contribute to enriching, perfecting, and developing the system of multi-party cooperation under the leadership of the Communist Party.

Fei Xiaotong, chairman of the central committee of the China Democratic League, presided over the four-day meeting.

The meeting heard a speech by a leading comrade of the Central Committee of the Communist Party on the issue of multi-party cooperation and conducted a serious and in-depth discussion on this issue.

The meeting believed that the system of multi-party cooperation under the leadership of the Communist Party is a fundamental institution in China's political structure. Since the 13th National Congress of the Communist Party, this system has been gradually improved and developed in practice, showing an inspiring prospect for accelerating the process of political democracy in China.

The meeting believed that the deepening of reform has placed higher demands on the democratic parties. We must take the cause of the state as our own responsibility, strengthen our own construction, enhance the party mechanism, and improve the level of participation in politics and policy-making.

The meeting also discussed and adopted the work points of the China Democratic League for 1989.

Vice-chairmen of the central committee of the China Democratic League, Qian Weichang, Gao Tian, Ye Duyi, Tan Jiazhen, Tao Dazhong, Luo Hanxian, Ma Dayu, Feng Zhichun, Ding Shishun, Kong Lingren, Xie Songkai, and standing committee members attended the meeting; standing committee members of the advisory committee of the central committee of the China Democratic League and heads of provincial-level local organizations were present at the meeting.
