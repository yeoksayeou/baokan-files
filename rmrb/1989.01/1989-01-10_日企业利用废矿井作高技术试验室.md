Japanese corporations are utilizing abandoned coal mines as laboratories for manufacturing new materials.

According to reports in Japanese newspapers, the abandoned mines in Japan reach depths of over 800 meters. During experiments, a sealed iron container with a diameter of 1.8 meters and a length of 7 meters is dropped down the mine shaft along a specific track, creating a weightless state that lasts for 10 seconds. By installing experimental equipment and cameras inside the sealed container, one can observe the special phenomena that occur as the object falls.

Japanese companies such as Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries, Fujitsu, Hitachi, Kajima Construction, and Nippon Steel Pipe are all formulating plans to use the old mines to develop new materials in a weightless environment. These companies are also preparing to establish an "Underground Zero-Gravity Environment Test Center" to jointly reduce experimental costs. It is said that this will be more cost-effective than using facilities such as the drop tower provided by the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

　　日企业利用废矿井作高技术试验室
    新华社东京１月５日电  日本的大企业正在利用报废的煤矿井作制造新材料的试验室。
    据日本报纸报道，在日本，报废的矿井深达８００余米，试验时把直径１．８米、长７米的铁制密封容器在井内顺着一定的轨道落下去，可出现失重状态，时间长达１０秒钟。在密封容器中安装试验装置和摄像机可以观察物体落下时发生的特殊现象。
    日本的石川岛播磨重工业、富士通、日立制作所、鹿岛建设、日本钢管等大企业都在制定利用旧矿井在失重状态下研制新材料计划。这些企业还准备设立“地下失重环境试验中心”，以便联合降低试验成本。据说，这将比利用美国航空和航天局的落下塔等设施要便宜。
