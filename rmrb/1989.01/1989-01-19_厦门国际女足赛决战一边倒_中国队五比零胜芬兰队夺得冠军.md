The final match of the China International Cup Women's Football Invitational Tournament drew tens of thousands of Xiamen fans, but the 5-0 lopsided score diminished the international level of this event.

The Chinese women's football team initially believed that their opponent in this decisive match was the only team they needed to take seriously. Coach Shang Ruihua specifically deployed the injured No. 11 Sun Qingmei to strengthen the left wing's offensive capabilities. However, the Chinese team's scoring came much faster than expected. Just three minutes into the game, right winger Wu Weiying advanced to the sideline and sent the ball to the Finnish team's goal area. Forward Niu Lijie rushed forward and scored. Ten minutes later, midfielder Liu Ailing shot from about 15 meters out with her left foot, increasing the score to 2-0. In the second half, the Chinese girls in red shirts and red pants did not miss any fast-break opportunities. Niu Lijie twice exploited gaps in the Finnish team's defense to score. Just before the final whistle, Wu Weiying broke free from the Finnish defenders and scored the fifth goal.

The Chinese team seemed to have exerted little effort, securing the championship with 26 goals scored and none conceded. The Finnish team took second place. The Japanese team and Fujian team ranked third and fourth, respectively.

　　厦门国际女足赛决战一边倒
    中国队五比零胜芬兰队夺得冠军
    本报厦门１月１８日电  记者汪大昭报道：争夺国贸杯女足邀请赛冠军的决战，吸引了上万名厦门球迷，但是５∶０的悬殊比分使这次国际赛事的水平大打折扣。
    中国女子足球队本来以为这场压轴戏中的对手是唯一需要认真对付的球队，教练商瑞华特意调遣带伤的１１号孙庆梅上阵，加强左翼的攻击力。比赛开始后，中国队的收获来得之快完全出人意料。刚刚踢了３分多钟，右边锋吴伟英杀到底线附近，把球送到芬兰队门前，中锋牛丽杰赶上一脚，敲开大门。１０分钟后，前卫刘爱玲在距球门１５米左右的地方左脚劲射，把比分扩大到２∶０。下半时，身穿红衣红裤的中国姑娘不放过每一次快攻机会，牛丽杰两次突袭芬兰队后防空当，破门得分。终场前不久，吴伟英摆脱芬兰队后卫的纠缠，射中第５个球。
    中国队似乎没有使出很大力气，便以进２６球、未失１球的战果，捧走了冠军杯。芬兰队获得亚军。日本队和福建队排名第三和第四位。
