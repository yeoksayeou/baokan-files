Shenzhen Seg Group Sets Sail for the World
Establishes Joint Ventures in More Than Ten Countries and Regions

	Xinhua News Agency reports: Correspondent Li Qi reports: The largest outward-looking electronics industry group in China—Shenzhen Seg Group—has accelerated its entry into the international market according to the coastal economic development strategy and has made significant progress.

	Currently, this group has established overseas joint ventures and business outlets in more than ten countries and regions, including the United States, Canada, Japan, West Germany, Kenya, and Hong Kong and Macau. It has established cooperative relationships with more than 100 companies in more than ten countries and regions, forming a multi-level, coordinated division of labor outward-looking enterprise group. This group now has 158 enterprises. In 1988, its output value reached 2.7 billion yuan, with export earnings of more than 200 million US dollars. Compared to the year the group was established in 1985, the output value has increased by 1.75 times, profits by 1.91 times, export earnings by 4.49 times, and the proportion of export products in the total output value has increased from 11% to over 42%.

	The basic experience of Shenzhen Seg Group in setting sail for the world is:

	—Utilizing the advantages of being adjacent to Hong Kong and Macau and located in the special economic zone, it borrows sales channels, talent, technology, and funds from abroad to develop under mutually beneficial conditions.

	—“Buying a ship to sail the sea.” Last year, Shenzhen Seg Group participated in the purchase of the sales network in the eastern United States of Canada, becoming one of its four major shareholders, thus opening a new path for Chinese electronic products to participate in international competition.

	—“Building a ship to sail the sea.” This group established a factory in Kenya in 1987 in cooperation with the Kenyan Nasir Company to produce color televisions and tape recorders, with all products sold locally. Subsequently, it established joint ventures in other countries aimed at developing new electronic computer and other home appliance products, achieving good results.

	The leader of Shenzhen Seg Group said that in recent years, the group has, through horizontal connections, successively cooperated with 15 universities, 28 research institutes, and 50 strong backbone enterprises in the mainland to carry out multi-level technological development and the promotion and application of scientific research achievements. In 1988 alone, it developed 220 new products, which played an important role in improving the group's product grade and quality and increasing its competitiveness in the international market.

　　深圳赛格集团扬帆远航世界
    在十余国和地区建立合资企业
    本报讯  记者李茜报道：我国目前最大的外向型电子工业集团——深圳赛格集团，依照沿海经济发展战略的构想，加快进入国际市场，取得了显著进展。
    现在这个集团已在美国、加拿大、日本、联邦德国、肯尼亚和港澳等十几个国家和地区建立了境外合资企业和业务网点；同十几个国家和地区的１００多家公司建立了合作关系，形成一个多层次、协调分工的外向型企业集团。这个集团已拥有１５８个企业，１９８８年产值达２７亿元，外销收入２亿多美元，与集团成立前的１９８５年相比：产值增长１．７５倍，利润增长１．９１倍，外销收入增长４．４９倍，外销产品占总产值的比例由１１％提高到４２％以上。
    赛格集团扬帆远航世界的基本经验是：
    ——利用毗邻港澳和位于特区的优势，向海外借销售渠道，借人才，借技术，借资金，在互利的条件下发展。
    ——“买船出海”。去年赛格集团参与购买了加拿大在美国东部的销售网络，成为它的四大股东之一，从而为中国电子产品参与国际竞争开辟了一条新路。
    ——“造船出海”。这个集团１９８７年即与肯尼亚纳西尔公司合资在肯尼亚开办生产彩电和收录机的工厂，产品全部在当地销售。接着，又在另外一些国家兴办了以开发电子计算机和其它家电新产品为目标的合资企业，获取好的效益。
    赛格集团的负责人说，这几年集团通过横向联系，陆续同内地１５所高等院校、２８个研究所和５０家实力雄厚的骨干企业合作，进行多层次的技术开发及科研成果的推广应用，仅１９８８年就开发新产品２２０种，对提高集团的产品档次和质量，增加在国际市场的竞争能力起了重要作用。
