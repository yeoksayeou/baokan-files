In the 1988 national tax, finance, and price inspection, central enterprises and institutions performed better in self-inspection compared to previous years. According to statistics from the State Council's inspection office, by the end of November 1988, 58 ministries and commissions, as well as state-owned companies under the central government, identified a total of 134.9 million yuan in violations. Of this amount, 54 million yuan was to be recovered, and 40.4 million yuan had already been remitted to the treasury.

Central departments treated this inspection as a crucial task in rectifying the economic environment and order. They had clear guidelines, strong leadership, and most units started early and acted swiftly. The Ministry of Railways began arranging self-inspections in September 1988. By the end of November, various ministries and commissions had dispatched 3,604 inspectors, an increase of 208 compared to the same period the previous year. Among them, 163 were at the bureau level or above, and 2,170 had the titles of economist or accountant and above. The high quality of the inspection teams helped in discovering and resolving issues, driving the inspection forward.

Many departments had strict requirements for self-inspections of their affiliated enterprises and institutions. The State Tobacco Monopoly Administration and other departments stipulated that any violations found by higher-level inspections would be strictly dealt with. The amount of violations to be remitted would be paid in full with their own funds and not used to offset the contract base number. The Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, and the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources adopted mutual inspection methods based on self-inspections to avoid loopholes. The General Company of Nonferrous Metals also made the quality of self-inspections a key factor in evaluating officials and enterprise rankings. To prevent self-inspections from being mere formalities, many departments proposed that if issues were found, the leaders of the respective units would be held accountable and appropriate economic penalties and administrative sanctions would be imposed on the leaders and direct responsible parties based on the situation.

　　在全国税收财务物价大检查中
    中央企事业单位自查好于往年
    本报讯  在１９８８年全国税收、财务、物价大检查中，中央企事业单位自查工作普遍好于往年。据国务院大检查办统计，截至去年１１月底，中央５８个部委、总公司所属企事业单位自查出违纪金额１３．４９亿元，其中应补交金额５．４亿元，已补交入库４．０４亿元。
    中央各部门把这次大检查作为治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序的重要工作来抓，指导思想明确，领导重视，多数单位抓得早，行动快。铁道部去年９月份就开始布置自查。截至去年１１月底，各部委共派出检查组人员３６０４人，比上年同期增加２０８人；其中司局级以上干部１６３人，有经济师、会计师以上职称的２１７０人，检查组人员素质较高，有利于发现和处理问题，推动了大检查。
    不少部门对所属企事业单位自查要求严格。中国烟草总公司等部门规定，凡被上一级查出的违纪问题从严处理，上交的违纪金额一律用自有资金上交给主管部门，不得抵顶包干基数；经贸部、地矿部等在所属单位自查基础上又采取互查办法来避免漏洞。有色金属总公司还把自查工作的好坏作为考核干部和企业上等级的一项主要内容。为防止自查走过场，许多部门提出如被查出问题，要拿各单位领导是问，并根据情况给予领导者和直接责任者一定的经济处罚和行政处分。
