From “Black Crow” to “Butterfly” – The Management Strategy of Wang Jinduo, Director of Zhengzhou Sanyou Shoe Factory

“The country has 300 million children, and children's shoes are thinly profitable and difficult to make. Others don't want to do it, but we will!” Zhengzhou Sanyou Shoe Factory, which had never produced children's shoes before, launched a series of children's health shoes and children's cotton shoes and boots with novel designs and cute appearances.

“Elderly people are the contributors to history, and they deserve to have comfortable and convenient shoes!” “Sanyou” presented a series of comfortable, anti-slip, and elegant elderly fitness shoes.

“Youth represent the pulse of the times, and they should be dressed more beautifully!” A series of fashionable and stylish new trendy health shoes were also born in this factory.

Clean and soft nursing shoes, lightweight and deodorizing textile worker shoes… all stood out.

The “Sanyou” shoe factory's long-standing “black crow” suddenly transformed into a colorful “butterfly,” fluttering across the country. Every time there was an order meeting, customers filled the venue. Their series of children's health shoes won the National Children's Living Goods Golden Deer Award; elderly fitness shoes and lightweight shoes were snapped up in two days at the Second National Elderly Living Goods Exhibition and were rated as the most popular products.

The transformation of Zhengzhou Sanyou Shoe Factory was forced!

The 40-year-old Sanyou Shoe Factory hit rock bottom in 1980, the lowest point since its establishment. The commercial department announced that they would no longer handle their products, and the warehouse was piled high with cloth shoes, occupying all the circulating funds. Workers had no work to do and no money to put in their pockets, sitting around complaining, blaming the lack of prospects in making cloth shoes, and clamoring to change professions. The entire factory was struggling in poverty. This was like a blow to the head for Wang Jinduo, who had just taken office.

Where was the way out? Wang Jinduo did not ask the mayor but asked the market. He, along with two other factory leaders and technical and sales personnel, divided into several teams to conduct surveys in the Northeast, Northwest, Southwest, and Jiangnan regions on the supply and demand situation of cloth shoes. They found that the elderly and children's shoes on the market were outdated in style, monotonous in color, and inconsistent in specifications, and the call for difficult-to-buy shoes was unending. He decisively proposed the production policy of developing new products according to different age structures, professions, and consumer levels to meet the needs of more consumers.

Wang Jinduo was born into a poor peasant family in Zhenping County, Henan Province. Hunger took his mother's life, and at the age of 11, he ran to the liberated area, put on military uniform, and became a soldier for 20 years. In 1969, he was transferred to the Sanyou Shoe Factory as an official. To quickly become an "insider" from an "outsider," Wang Jinduo squeezed time to work alongside workers, learning shoe-making techniques. He also studied enterprise management, sales knowledge, painting, aesthetics, and more, like a bee gathering nectar. Every day, he took time to read various newspapers to gather information. In his third year as the director, when raw materials were scarce, a newspaper reported that "SBS" thermoplastic rubber was born in Jiangsu. He was overjoyed and bought a ticket to Jiangsu the next day. The train took him to his destination and brought him back to Zhengzhou, covering a journey of over 2,000 kilometers, including buying tickets, negotiating business, and carrying back over 20 kilograms of materials to the experimental machine. After repeated experiments, the "SBS" thermoplastic rubber tourist shoes were finally successfully developed. In 1985, they passed the technical appraisal, bringing the factory's products to a new level.

Cloth shoes are not like color TVs or refrigerators, which are in high demand. Thousands of enterprises produce them, and millions of stores sell them. Even if your product is top-notch, if the distribution units do not stock it, it cannot meet the consumers. While Wang Jinduo focused on production, he also kept an eye on the distribution units, proposing the business policy of sincerely inviting customers from all over the world and providing convenience to customers everywhere. At the order meeting, he announced: For those who sell "Sanyou" shoes, any quality issues, regardless of when the goods were purchased, will be repaired or replaced; for department stores or companies that purchase goods according to signed contracts, if the goods are not suitable for local sales, the factory will promptly replace them, and will not occupy the buyer's warehouse or tie up funds. Someone in the factory was concerned about economic losses. Wang Jinduo said, this way can force us to pay attention to product quality and increase marketable products; at the same time, it can eliminate the concerns of the commercial department, making them dare to stock up. Indeed, they once replaced goods for a commercial unit in another province, and in return, they received more large-scale orders.

“Sanyou” sincerely invites customers from all over the world, and their eyes are not just on large customers. Wang Jinduo believes that individual business owners can flexibly and quickly deliver products to consumers and can also promptly feedback market information to the factory. Wang Jinduo considered that the factory's location is far from the train station and long-distance bus station, making it difficult for individual business owners to take public buses or hire vehicles to transport goods from the factory. Therefore, they added tricycles and cars, specifically for delivering goods to individual business owners. From one box to dozens of boxes, they all deliver for free to the designated stations. They have insisted on this practice for 6 years, welcoming more and more individual merchants.

　　从“黑老鸦”到“花蝴蝶”
    ——郑州三友鞋厂厂长王金铎的经营之道
    本报记者  李茜
    “全国有３亿儿童，童鞋利薄难做，别人不愿干，我们干！”从来没有生产过童鞋的郑州三友鞋厂推出一双双造型新颖、神态憨稚的儿童保健鞋和童棉鞋、棉靴系列产品。
    “老年人是历史的奉献者，该让他们脚上舒适，行走轻便！”“三友”捧出一双双舒适、防滑、素中有俏的老年健身鞋。
    “青年人代表着时代的脉搏，该把他们打扮得更漂亮！”款式新颖的新潮健美鞋又在这个厂诞生了。
    洁白轻软的护士鞋，轻盈兼能除臭保健的纺织工人鞋……脱颖而出。
    “三友”鞋厂多年一成不变的“黑老鸦”，一跃而为色彩斑斓的“花蝴蝶”，纷纷扬扬飞向全国各地，每次订货会客户爆满。他们生产的儿童保健鞋系列产品，荣获国家儿童生活用品金鹿奖；老年健身鞋和轻便鞋，在第二届全国老年人生活用品展销会上两天就争购一空，被评为最受欢迎的产品。
    郑州三友鞋厂的这个变化，是逼出来的！
    有４０多年历史的三友鞋厂，１９８０年跌入了它诞生以来的谷底，商业部门宣布不再包销他们的产品，仓库里布鞋堆积如山，占用了全部流动资金。工人手中没活干，口袋里没钱装，坐在那里发牢骚，埋怨做布鞋没前途，吵嚷着要改行，整个工厂在贫困中挣扎着。这对刚刚走马上任的王金铎，无异是当头一闷杆。
    船究竟湾在哪里呢？王金铎不问市长问市场，他同本厂的另外两位厂领导和技术人员、销售人员兵分几路，到东北、西北、西南和江南一带，对布鞋的供需情况进行调查，发现市场上销售的老人鞋和儿童鞋式样陈旧，色调单一，规格不齐，买鞋难的呼声不绝于耳。他果断地提出，按不同年龄结构、不同职业和消费层次开发新产品的生产方针，满足更多消费者的需求。
    王金铎出生在河南省镇平县一个贫苦农民家里，饥饿夺去了母亲的生命，１１岁他就跑到解放区，穿上军装当了兵，一干就是２０年。１９６９年转业到三友鞋厂任干事。为了尽快由“外行”变“内行”，王金铎挤时间跟班劳动，学习制鞋技术；他还像蜜蜂采蜜一样，研究企业管理、销售知识，以及绘画、美学等等。他每天抽时间阅览多种报纸，从中了解信息。他任厂长的第３年，原料缺乏，报纸上登载，“ＳＢＳ”热塑性橡胶在江苏诞生，他欣喜若狂，第二天就买票去江苏。火车把他送到目的地，又把他拉回郑州，行程２０００多公里，包括买票、交涉业务，背回２０多公斤材料，送到进行试验的机器上，总共用了４２个小时。经过反复试验，“ＳＢＳ”热塑性橡胶旅游鞋终于试制成功，１９８５年通过技术鉴定，使这个厂的产品上了一个新台阶。
    布鞋不是像彩电、冰箱那样的紧俏商品，千百个企业生产，千万家店铺经营，哪怕你的产品是第一流的，经销单位不进货，也不能同广大消费者见面。王金铎把生产搞上去的同时，眼睛瞄准经销单位，提出诚招天下客，处处给客户方便的经营方针。他在订货会上宣布：经销“三友”的鞋，凡属质量问题，不论何时进的货，一律保修保换；对百货商店或公司按签订合同进货的商品，如当地不适销，工厂及时予以调换，绝不占用买方的仓库或积压资金。厂里有人担心经济上受损失。王金铎说，这样做可以逼着我们重视产品质量，增加适销产品；同时解除商业部门后顾之忧，使他们大胆进货。果然，他们给外地一个商业单位调了一次货，换回来的是更多次大批进货。
    “三友”诚招天下客，眼睛不光盯着大客户，对个体户也处处提供方便。王金铎认为个体户可以灵活快速地将产品送到消费者手中，而且能及时将市场信息反馈给工厂。王金铎考虑到三友的厂址距火车站和长途汽车站较远，个体户从工厂购货后挤公共汽车不易，雇车运送也难。于是就添置了三轮车、汽车，专门为个体户送货，从一人一箱至几十箱，都免费送至指定的站点，这样的做法他们已坚持了６年，迎来了越来越多的个体商贩。
