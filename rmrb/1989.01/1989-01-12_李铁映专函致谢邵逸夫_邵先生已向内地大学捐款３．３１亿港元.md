	The letter stated, "You regard education as the foundation of the nation, and you sincerely hope for the prosperity and development of China's education. Every year, you generously donate large sums of money to mainland universities, covering projects across the Great Wall, both north and south of the Yangtze River, which is highly praised by people on the mainland. Your contribution is not just the donation of funds, but more importantly, your deep love for the Chinese people."

The State Education Commission has also sent 10 people to Hong Kong for further study on a full scholarship for the first time.

	Shaw said in his speech that the future of China's reform and opening up depends mainly on the cultivation of talent and the popularization of science and technology. Universities are shouldering this heavy responsibility. He emphasized his long-standing commitment to promoting university education, both in Hong Kong and in China.
