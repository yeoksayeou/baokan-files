The transformation of the educational model lies in the updating of educational thought.

The world today is entering a transitional period marked by global reform and adjustment. In the process of comprehensive social reform, many new problems arise that need to be solved through educational reform. This requires changing the traditional school education model and exploring a new education model that meets the demands of the times. The key to the transformation of the educational model lies in the updating of educational thought.

The debate between old and new learning during the May Fourth Movement is often described as a conflict between traditional Confucian ethics and the transmission of cultural knowledge. However, another educational thought that aims to meet the needs of society and life has been overlooked. This is the educational thought of Marxists Wen Deying and Yang Xianjiang, as well as famous Chinese educators like Cai Yuanpei and Tao Xingzhi. Cai Yuanpei proposed in 1900 that "education should aim to benefit oneself and society." He particularly emphasized worldview and aesthetics. Tao Xingzhi's life education is "all that is needed in life." The educational thought of Marxism and Cai Yuanpei, Tao Xingzhi, and others is not only applicable to the past but also to the present and future.

Marxist educational thought is in line with the reality of socialist education. Over the decades, it has guided our education to achieve great success. However, in its implementation, there have been many biases. First, we have opposed social needs and personal needs, and full development and individual development, often emphasizing only one aspect. Second, education should focus on politics during the revolutionary stage and on the economy during the construction stage. Our problem is that we have not timely shifted to the track of focusing on the economy. Due to these two biases, we have not transitioned from education that focuses on transmitting cultural knowledge to education that meets social and personal needs. The roots of the two major problems of pursuing high admission rates and the separation of ideological work from teaching work lie here.

The functions of education are multifaceted. In the past, education was seen only as a means of cultural transmission, which is incomplete. Tao Xingzhi once said, "If education is merely the transmission of social experience, it lacks the driving force for progress." He used the concept of "teaching and learning as one" to explain educational phenomena, summarizing the functions of education as "(1) action; (2) thought; (3) the creation of new values." From action comes thought, and from thought comes the creation of new values. This is the creative process. This is a concise statement of the functions of education and the basis for entrepreneurial education.

The choice of educational model should be based on the whole of education.

The educational thought, educational model, and school model of modern society are all undergoing changes. This transformation has no ready-made model to follow; we must explore it through practice. There are two points to clarify in changing the model: first, the educational model should not be limited to school education; second, education should not merely aim to transmit cultural knowledge but should aim to meet the comprehensive needs of society and life.

Changing the educational model should be based on the whole of education. Comprehensive education is a structure formed by the interweaving of lifelong education and universal education. In Taiwan or Japan, it is called integrated education. In the Soviet Union or South America, it is called cooperative education. This is the comprehensive education that meets the needs of modern social production. In summary, it generally includes the following aspects:

1. Everyone is an educator, and everyone is a learner. Educators and learners are inseparable.
2. The whole of life is the whole of education, and the process of life is the process of education. Life has two stages: before and after employment. The post-employment stage includes working time and leisure time; the content also includes conquering nature and transforming society. These aspects are all inseparable from education. Education covers all aspects of human life. According to Tao Xingzhi's theory of "life as education," it is "live to old age; work to old age; learn to old age."
3. Any public institution is also an educational institution. Educational institutions, in addition to schools, include families and society. The influence of society on individuals far exceeds that of schools on students. Therefore, any public institution is not only an institution engaged in public affairs but also an institution for cultivating talents. In this way, the materials, methods, tools, and environment of education can all be greatly increased.
4. There should be different educational methods and learning methods suitable for everyone. We should not replace educational methods and learning methods with the teaching methods of courses. We still lack a methodology for educational science. The characteristic of education is to use cultural knowledge as raw material, through the education factory, through educational technology to transform it into action and thought, and produce new values. This is the process of education, the process of creation.
5. Educational activities are comprehensive. Every place and every school's education has seven aspects: goals, plans, methods, tools, guidance, assessment, and benefits, thus forming the comprehensive process of education. We cannot use the "examination-only method" to evaluate education as we do now. Our vocational education currently only stays at the level of transmitting a single technology, which is only a part of the comprehensive vocational education activities. According to modern scientific views, terms like vocational education or adult education are no longer accurate because employment is the center of life. Its comprehensive activities are composed of stages such as cognition, exploration, orientation, preparation, placement, employment, follow-up investigation, and re-education. The current problem is that many educational activities do not scientifically follow the comprehensive process of education but often focus on a single activity, thus lacking comprehensive effectiveness.
6. Develop comprehensive technical education. Comprehensive technical education differs from vocational education. The former is general technical education, while the latter is specialized technical education for specific needs. Because our vocational education is only a single specialized technical education and has not been combined with comprehensive technical education, it lacks adaptability, which is a fundamental reason why vocational education itself cannot develop normally. In terms of purpose, comprehensive technical education should, like cultural foundation education, gradually become the foundation education for solving the comprehensive development of individuals. The fundamental harm caused by the pursuit of high admission rates is the one-sided development of individuals, the root of which lies in the fact that schools only have cultural foundation education and lack comprehensive technical foundation education. Comprehensive technical education must be combined with intellectual education, physical education, and aesthetic education. It must be combined with productive labor and vocational education to produce the comprehensive benefits of education.

Entrepreneurial education is to combine employment and creation.

Entrepreneurial education is an exploration of future education, a new attempt. As the name suggests, entrepreneurial education is the education of cultivating talents. "Employment" refers to employment and career. "Creation" refers to creative thinking, creative learning, and creative labor in employment and career to create new values.

Entrepreneurial education aims to cultivate a reasonable life. According to Marx's materialist view of history, life revolves around the needs of individuals and society and the labor to meet those needs. Entrepreneurial education first aims to cultivate a reasonable life. By "reasonable," it means to correctly handle the mutual relationship between social needs and individual needs and the relationship between labor activities and other activities. Without the satisfaction of individual needs, there can be no satisfaction of social needs; individual needs can only be satisfied in the process of satisfying social needs.

Under socialist conditions, people need to work and engage in careers that suit their personal development. Therefore, employment is the center of comprehensive education. The United States' livelihood education, West Germany's compulsory vocational education and higher vocational education all take employment as the center of education. This vocational education is different from our current practice of treating vocational education as the specialized transmission of a single skill. Vocational education should be combined with general education, aiming to cultivate vocational awareness, vocational cultivation, vocational ethics, and vocational knowledge and skills. In this sense, entrepreneurial education is also the education of combining employment and creation. The whole of life can be divided into three stages: pre-employment, post-employment, and non-employment. Pre-employment refers to the initial education—vocational education cycle; post-employment refers to vocational education—continuing education cycle; non-employment refers to continuing education—senior education cycle. Our focus should be on the first cycle. These three cycles are three interconnected educational circles, a whole.

Engels, in foreseeing the future of a communist society, said: "Man finally becomes the master of his own social combination, and thus also the master of nature, the master of himself—free man" (Marx and Engels, Collected Works, Vol. 19, p. 247). These three aspects should place people and society first and organically combine them. From this comprehensive understanding, entrepreneurial education should, based on the psychological characteristics of young people, take establishing a correct worldview as the fundamental task of education. Entrepreneurial education has an important principle: moral education is the foundation, and entrepreneurship is the application.

Science, education, and the economy must form a sequence to fully develop productivity. Science and education are important conditions for developing the economy. In this sequence, science and education are intermediaries for each other, that is, science and the economy are combined with education as the intermediary, and education and the economy are combined with science as the intermediary. Entrepreneurial education is to correctly handle the relationship between these three, that is, to rely on science, base on education, and develop the economy. The starting point and destination are to cultivate entrepreneurs who can combine science and the economy. Currently, we should emphasize local resources and local talent development, focusing on primary, junior high, and senior high school graduates who do not have the opportunity to continue their education, developing their intelligence, helping them to start their own businesses, and serving to strengthen agriculture and township enterprises.

The cultivation goal of entrepreneurial education is, based on the principles of comprehensive technical education, to cultivate individuals with the ability to engage in a certain profession and adapt to socialist society, through their creative labor, to make contributions to human progress and social development to the best of their abilities.

　　关于更新教育思想进行创业教育的探讨
    胡晓风 
    教育模式变革在于教育思想更新
    当今世界正进入一个以全球范围改革、调整为标志的转折时期。在社会全面改革过程中不断提出的许多新问题，需要通过改革教育来解决。这就要求改变传统教育的学校教育模式，探索适应时代要求的新的教育模式；而教育模式的变革，关键在于教育思想的更新。
    “五四”时期的旧学和新学之争，通常的说法是以讲儒家伦理道德为目的的旧学和以传授文化知识为目的的新学之争。其实还有一种以满足社会需要和人生需要为目的的教育思想被忽略了。那就是马克思主义者恽代英和杨贤江以及当时一些中国著名教育家蔡元培、陶行知等人的教育思想。蔡元培于１９００年就提出“学当以益己、益世为宗旨”，他特别强调世界观和美育。陶行知的生活教育就是“凡人生一切所需皆属之”。马克思主义的教育思想和蔡元培、陶行知等人的教育思想，不仅对过去适用，对现在和未来都是有用的。
    马克思主义的教育思想是符合社会主义教育实际的，几十年来指导我们的教育取得了很大的成绩。但我们在执行之中也有不少偏颇之处。一是把社会需要和人生需要对立起来，把全面发展和个性发展对立起来，往往只强调了一个方面。二是教育应该在革命阶段以政治为中心，在建设阶段以经济为中心，我们的问题是没有及时转到以经济为中心的轨道上来。正因为这两方面的偏颇，使得我们没有从以传授文化知识为目的的教育转到满足社会需要和人生需要为目的的教育。片面追求升学率和思想工作与教学工作的隔绝这两大弊端的根源就在这里。
    教育的功能是多方面的。过去，把教育仅仅作为文化传递的手段这是不全面的。陶行知曾经讲过：“若教育是仅仅把社会的经验传递下去，那就缺少进步的动力”。他用教学做合一来说明教育现象，把教育的功能归结为“（一）行动；（二）思想；（三）新价值之产生。“由行动而发生思想，由思想产生新价值，这就是创造的过程”。这是对教育功能的简明表述，是创业教育的根据。
    　　　　教育模式的选择要从整体教育着眼
    现代社会的教育思想、教育模式和学校模式都在发生变革。这种变革没有现成的样板可循，要靠我们在实践中探索。改变模式有两点要明确：一是教育模式不能局限于学校教育；二是教育不能仅仅以传授文化知识为目的，而应以满足社会和人生的综合需要为目的。
    改变教育模式要从整体教育着眼。整体教育是以全民教育与终身教育为纵横交织的结构所构成的。在台湾或日本，称为整合教育。在苏联或南美，称为合作教育。这是适合现代社会生产所需要的大教育观的整体教育。归纳起来，大体有以下几方面：
    １、人人都是教育者，人人都是受教育者，教育者与受教育者分不开。
    ２、人生的整体就是教育的整体，人生的过程就是教育的过程。人生有职业前和职业后两个阶段，职业后阶段有从业时间和闲暇时间之分；内容还有征服自然、改造社会两个部分。这些方面都离不开教育。教育涉及人类生活的全部领域，按照陶行知“生活即教育”的理论，就是“活到老；做到老；学到老”。
    ３、任何公共机构同时都是教育机构。教育机构除了学校以外，还有家庭和社会。社会对人的影响，大大超过学校之对于学生的影响，因而任何公共机构既是从事公共事业的机构，又是培养人才的教育机构。这样，教育的材料、教育的方法、教育的工具、教育的环境，都可以大大增加。
    ４、要有适用于所有人的不同的教育方法和学习方法。不能以课程的教学法代替教育方法和学习方法。我们还缺少教育科学的方法论。教育的特征，就是以文化知识为原料，通过教育这个加工厂，通过教育工艺使之转化为行动、思想，产生新价值。这就是教育的过程，创造的过程。
    ５、教育活动是整体的。每个地方、每个学校的教育都有目标、计划、方法、工具、指导、考核、效益等七个方面，从而构成教育过程的整体，不能像现在用“唯考试法”来评估教育。我们的职业教育，目前仅仅停留在单一技术的传授上，这只是职业教育活动整体的一部分。按照现代科学的观点，职业教育或者成人教育这些词都不准确了，因为职业是人生的中心，其整体活动由认知、试探、定向、准备、安置、就业、追踪调查以及再教育等阶段构成。现在的问题是，很多教育活动没有科学地按照教育过程的整体去进行，往往是孤立地抓其中的某项活动，因而缺乏整体效应。
    ６、发展综合技术教育。综合技术教育与职业教育有异，前者是一般的技术教育，后者是特定需要的专业技术教育。由于我们的职业教育只是一种单一的专业技术教育，没有和综合技术教育结合起来，因而适应性不强，这是职业教育本身不能得到正常发展的一个根本原因。从目的来讲，综合技术教育应该和文化基础教育一样，成为逐步解决人的全面发展的基础教育。片面追求升学率所带来根本危害是人的发展片面性，其根源就在于学校只有文化基础教育而缺少综合技术教育的基础。综合技术教育必须和智育、体育、美育结合起来，必须和生产劳动结合起来，必须和职业教育结合起来，才能产生教育整体的效益。
    　　　　创业教育就是要把职业和创造结合起来
    创业教育是探索未来教育的一种假说，一种新的尝试。顾名思义，创业教育就是培养人才的教育。“业”是指职业和事业。“创”即创造，创造性思维，创造性学习，在职业和事业中进行创造性劳动，创造新价值。
    创业教育以培养合理的人生为宗旨。按照马克思的唯物史观，人生就是围绕人和社会的需要及满足需要的劳动而展开的人的一切活动。创业教育，首先要以培养合理的人生为宗旨。所谓合理，就是要正确处理好社会需要和个人需要的相互关系、劳动活动与其他活动的关系。没有个人需要的满足，就谈不上社会需要的满足；个人需要也只有在社会需要得到满足的过程中才能得到满足。
    在社会主义条件下，人们要劳动，也要从事职业，从事适合个性发展的事业。因而职业是整体教育的中心。美国的生计教育，联邦德国的职业义务教育和职业高等教育都是以职业为教育的中心。这种职业教育和我们当前把职业教育当做专门的传授一技之长的做法是有区别的。职业教育应当和普通教育结合在一起，以培养职业意识、职业修养、职业道德以及职业知识和技能为目标。从这个意义上讲，创业教育也就是职业和创造相结合的教育。整个人生可以分成职前、职后、职外三个阶段：职前即初始教育——职业教育周期；职后即职业教育——继续教育周期；职外即继续教育——老年教育周期。我们的工作重点，要放在第一个周期上。这三个周期是三个连环教育圈，是一个整体。
    恩格斯在预言未来的共产主义社会前景时说过：“人终于成为自己的社会结合的主人，从而也就成为自然界的主人，成为自己本身的主人——自由的人”（《马克思恩格斯全集第１９卷，２４７页）。这三个方面要把人与社会放在第一位，并且把三者有机结合在一起。从这个整体认识出发，创业教育要根据青年的心理特点，以树立正确的世界观作为教育的根本任务，创业教育有一条重要原则，就是德育为本，创业为用。
    科技、教育、经济只有形成序列才能充分发展生产力，科技、教育是发展经济的重要条件。在这个序列中，科技、教育互为中介，即科技与经济相结合以教育为中介，教育与经济相结合以科技为中介。创业教育就是要正确处理这三者的关系，即依靠科技，立足教育，发展经济。出发点和归宿是培养能把科技与经济结合起来的创业人才。当前要强调就地取材和就地育才，把注意力放在没有升学的小学、初中和高中毕业生上，开发他们的智力，帮助他们自立创业，为加强农业和乡镇企业服务。
    创业教育的培养目标是根据综合技术教育原理，培养具有从事一定职业的劳动能力和适应社会主义社会生活能力的人，通过其创造性劳动，为人类进步和社会发展而作出力所能及的贡献。
