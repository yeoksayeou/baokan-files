The State Council recently issued a directive on the importance of and strengthening work on organic fertilizers, calling on local authorities to focus on the development and utilization of organic fertilizer sources, encouraging farmers to apply more organic fertilizers, increase investment in land, and improve soil fertility.

The State Council pointed out in this document that the use of organic fertilizers is a fine tradition in China's agricultural production. However, in recent years, there has been a tendency in rural areas to prioritize chemical fertilizers over organic fertilizers, to prioritize land use over land cultivation, and to prioritize output over input. As a result, the amount of farmyard manure used has decreased in many areas, the area of green manure crops has shrunk, and urban waste and garbage have hardly been utilized. The main reasons for this situation are: first, the leadership has generally relaxed its attention to organic fertilizer work and has not given it the importance it deserves; second, the labor intensity of accumulating organic fertilizers is high, the methods are backward, and farmers, influenced by short-term behavior in land use, are reluctant to invest more in organic fertilizers; third, there is a lack of corresponding policies and necessary economic support measures. Practice has proven that long-term use of only chemical fertilizers cannot meet the needs of crops for various nutrients. Therefore, the State Council makes the following directives:

1. Emphasize the use of organic fertilizers. Organic fertilizers can provide a large amount of phosphorus and potassium, which is of great significance in alleviating the imbalance of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in fertilizers in China at present when the supply of phosphorus and potassium fertilizers is insufficient. The widespread development and utilization of organic fertilizer sources can also improve the urban and rural environment.

2. Study and formulate policies and regulations to encourage farmers to increase the input of organic fertilizers. While improving the household contract responsibility system, it is necessary not only to clarify the farmers' right to use the land but also to stipulate the farmers' obligation to improve soil fertility. The Ministry of Agriculture should, on the basis of summarizing the experiences of various places, quickly draft the national soil fertility conservation regulations, so that this work has legal basis.

3. Speed up the formulation of plans for the development of organic fertilizers. (1) Expand the sources of farmyard manure. (2) Promote the return of crop straw to the field. (3) Restore and develop green manure production. (4) Improve the use of urban manure.

4. Strengthen the scientific and technological work on organic fertilizers. The research work on organic fertilizers should be included in the agenda, and the scientific research, education, and promotion departments should cooperate to tackle key problems.

5. Solve the problems of funds and materials for the development of organic fertilizers. The relevant state departments and local governments should allocate some funds, mainly for the development and utilization of organic fertilizers, new technology experiments, demonstrations, and promotion, as well as the construction of green manure seed bases. The planning, material, commercial, banking, and other departments at all levels should support the production of organic fertilizer processing, transportation machinery, and storage equipment in terms of materials and loans.

6. Strengthen organizational leadership. The development and utilization of organic fertilizers should be regarded as an important task by governments at all levels, which should seriously study and implement it. The accumulation of organic fertilizers should be an important content for the assessment of county and township cadres. The relevant departments of agriculture, planning, science and technology, agricultural machinery, urban construction, environmental sanitation, environmental protection, materials, commerce, finance, and banking should be organized to closely cooperate, divide labor, and work together to do a good job in this regard.

### 鼓励多施农家肥　进一步增进地力  国务院要求重视开发利用有机肥

　　鼓励多施农家肥　进一步增进地力
    国务院要求重视开发利用有机肥  
    据新华社北京电  国务院最近发出关于重视和加强有机肥料工作的指示，要求各地重视有机肥源的开发和利用，鼓励农民多施有机肥料，增加对土地的投入，搞好地力建设。
    国务院在这个文件中指出，使用有机肥料，是我国农业生产的优良传统。但近几年来，在农村出现了重化肥轻有机肥、重用地轻养地、重产出轻投入的倾向，不少地区农家肥的使用量减少，绿肥作物种植面积下降，大中城市的粪肥、垃圾也很少利用。出现这种情况的主要原因：一是普遍放松了对有机肥料工作的领导，没有把它摆到应有位置；二是积造有机肥料的劳动强度大，手段落后，加上农民对土地利用存在短期行为，不愿多投入有机肥；三是没有制定相应的政策，缺乏必要的经济扶持措施。实践证明，长期单一使用化肥，不能满足农作物对多种养分的需要。为此，国务院特作如下指示：
    一、要十分重视使用有机肥料。有机肥料能提供大量的磷、钾元素，在目前磷、钾肥供应不足的情况下，对缓解我国化肥中氮磷钾肥比例失调，具有重要意义。广泛开发利用有机肥源，还可以净化城乡环境。
    二、研究制定鼓励农民增加有机肥料投入的政策和法规。在完善联产承包责任制的同时，不仅要明确农民对土地的使用权，还要规定农民有提高地力的义务。农业部要在总结各地经验的基础上，抓紧拟定全国耕地肥力保养条例，使这项工作有法可依。
    三、抓紧制定发展有机肥料的规划。（一）广辟农家肥。（二）推广秸秆还田。（三）恢复和发展绿肥生产。（四）搞好城肥下乡。  　四、加强有机肥料的科技工作。要把有机肥料的研究工作列入日程，组织科研、教育、推广部门协作攻关。
    五、切实解决发展有机肥料的资金和物资。国家有关部门和地方政府要安排一些资金，主要用于有机肥料的开发利用，新技术试验、示范和推广工作，以及绿肥作物种子基地建设等。各级计划、物资、商业、银行等部门对生产有机肥加工、运输机具以及仓储设备等，要在物资和贷款上给予支持。
    六、加强组织领导。开发利用有机肥料，各级政府要作为一项重要工作，认真研究，狠抓落实。要把积造有机肥，作为考核县乡干部的重要内容。要组织农业、计划、科技、农机、城建、环卫、环保、物资、商业、财税、银行等有关部门密切配合，分工协作，共同抓好这项工作。
