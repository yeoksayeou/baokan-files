In recent years, Chinese people have become interested in discussing their own culture, a trend often referred to as "reflecting on traditional Chinese culture." Suddenly, numerous viewpoints emerged, and for the first time, Chinese people, who have lived for thousands of years in a certain way, seem to have collectively, broadly, and realistically, with a kind of enlightenment-like courage, looked back at the cultural phenomena on this land of China, located at 30 degrees north latitude. Some highly evaluate this "cultural fever," believing it "foreshadows another movement of ideological liberation in Chinese history." The collision of various viewpoints includes serious contemplation, passionate outpouring, and, of course, inevitably, some Don Quixote-like blind actions. However, one point is consistent: this war declared by contemporary people against ancient people is not to judge the right and wrong of ancestors, but for today's China, for the problems that have long puzzled the people, namely, why China has not yet become rich and strong?

The impact of this "cultural fever" on China's future development and the extent of its influence on people's souls cannot be easily assessed without serious research, analysis, and a certain distance in time. However, some sober-minded individuals have not returned to calmness even after the heat has subsided. Among the young scholars who once "spoke eloquently" in the "cultural" discussions, Yuan Zhimin quietly published a heavy little book titled "The Heavy Subject - An Examination of Chinese Traditional Values" after the "excitement" had passed.

Initially, I thought it would be just some familiar tunes, but after reading it, I realized that the author's more than ten thousand words were the result of years of research, filled with rational analysis and deep emotion, expressing a sense of resentment. Without a deep love for one's country, it is difficult to emit such a Lu Xun-like cry:

    In history, have the Chinese people hindered or how have they hindered themselves?
    In reality, should the Chinese people and how can they transcend themselves?
    How can we, who are not modernized, complete the modernization of China?

The conclusion is—we need "subjective self-awareness." Readers should not assume that the author merely indulges in self-deprecation in the book. On the contrary, the book clearly proposes: only we—Chinese people ourselves—are the subjects of China's modernization!

    As mentioned in the book, "intense flashes of thought will make the world look bleak." But this "bleakness" makes people see more clearly around them. The book exudes a certain melancholic atmosphere, and the author describes himself as "deeply pessimistic." However, I felt the pulsating blood beneath the melancholic shell. No matter where the Chinese people go, they have to eat Chinese food; if a person needs to transplant an animal organ due to necessity, it is still a human being in the overall concept. Building China's modernization can only be done by the yellow-skinned, black-haired Chinese people. It is a joyous and fortunate thing that we finally have the courage to raise Dancoe's sword and cut into our own hearts. A person's future often depends on his criticism of his own past, and "the highest achievement of national spirit is self-awareness." (Hegel)

The title "The Heavy Subject" refers to the subject, which is opposed to the object, and here the subject refers to the knower of the objective world—people; and calling it "heavy" specifically refers to us "Chinese people." The author, starting from traditional values, directs his pen towards the present Chinese people; his thoughts are focused on the future modernization of China. As the author's logical reasoning unfolds, readers will gradually realize the deep-seated "non-subjective value self" that has been passed down for thousands of years.

Confucius first proposed the idea of "poo bu bi," encouraging people to doubt themselves and not insist on their own opinions. Later, the teachings of Mencius, Xunzi, and other Confucian scholars further developed the negation of individual will; while Laozi and Zhuangzi's "saint does not desire" reached the extreme of self-negation and self-annihilation. If "poo bu bi" is the suppression of the will self in the personality, then the Daoist "wu wei" more successfully suppressed the creation of the self, to the extreme, believing that the highest state of life is "I lose myself"! From this, it can be seen that the "actions" of Confucius, Mozi, Xunzi, and other thinkers of the past dynasties in society are all eager to set up various norms that make the Chinese people do nothing. Although the development of these ideas has given some reclusive sages a certain psychological balance when they are not appreciated for their talents and has given ancient and modern people some "noble" aesthetic feelings, they have objectively become obstacles to historical development. The treatise also believes that Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism have the same effect on the value system of the Chinese people, and compares them with the utilitarian personality of the West. While affirming the positive significance of "harmony" that the Eastern people pursue in terms of national cohesion and moral ethics, the article also evaluates the historical inertia of this "pan-harmonious value goal" and concludes: "losing subjective consciousness, this is the value goal of harmony of ancient Chinese people."

Indeed, it is difficult to fully discuss all the traditional values of China in just ten thousand words, just as the author's frank confession: "I hate the national tradition of combining hardness and softness from the bottom of my heart, and I would rather lean towards the bias of hardness," showing a philosopher's obstinacy.

### 读《沉重的主体》

　　读《沉重的主体》
    梁平
    近些年来，中国人兴自己议论自己来了，时髦的说法是“对中国传统文化的反思”。一时间论点云集，数千年来按照某种方式做人的中国人，似乎第一次如此广泛地、宏观地同时又是现实地，对位于地球北纬３０度的这块华夏大地上的文化现象，以彻悟般的勇气作了一番回眸谛视。有人高度评价这场“文化热”，认为其“预示着中国历史上又一次思想解放运动的到来”。各种观点的碰撞，有凝重的思索，有激情的宣泄，当然也难免有唐·吉诃德“战风车”式的盲目。然而有一点却是一致的：这场今人对古人的宣战，目的不是为了臧否祖宗的是非，而是为了当今的中国，为了人民困惑已久的问题，即中国为何至今未能富强起来？
    这场“文化热”对我国未来发展的影响，对人们心灵的震荡幅度，没有认真的研究分析和一定的时间距离，是不好随便评说的。但是，一些清醒之士却未因热点的冷却而归于平静。在“文化”讨论中也曾“鼓舌如簧”的青年学者远志明，待“热闹劲儿”过了之后，却悄悄地托出了一册沉甸甸的小书《沉重的主体——中国人传统价值观考察》。
    本以为不过是一些听熟了的调子，然捧读之后，方知作者这十余万字是积多年之研究，充满理性分析又不失浓情“恨”意写就的。没有对故国厚重的爱恋，是很难发出这种鲁迅式的呐喊：
    历史上，中国人是否阻碍或怎样阻碍了自己？
    现实中，中国人是否应当和怎样才能超越自己？
    非现代化的我们何以完成中国现代化的改造？
    结论是——我们需要“主体自我意识”。读者切莫以为作者只在书中尽情地自我贬低一番了事，恰恰相反，文中鲜明地提出：只有我们——中国人自身——才是中国现代化的主体！
    正如文中所说：“激烈的思想闪电会把世界照得惨白”。但这种“惨白”却令人们比平时更清晰地看清了四周。书中多少透着某种悲凉的气息，作者自称为“深刻的悲观”。然我却从悲凉的硬壳下面，触到了热流涌动的血脉。中国人不管走到哪里，都要吃中国饭；人身上假使因为需要可以移植一件动物器官，但从整体概念上讲，它仍然是人。建设中国的现代化，只有靠黄肤黑发的中国人。可喜可贺的是，我们终于有勇气举起丹柯的利剑，剖向自身的心灵。人的未来往往取决于他对自身过去的批判，“民族精神的最高成就是自知”。（黑格尔语）
    书名题为《沉重的主体》，主体是与客体相对的，这里所说的主体，是指对客观世界的认识者——人；而谓其“沉重”，是特指我们“中国人”。作者从传统的价值观切入，笔锋所向是现今的中国人；心念所系是中国未来的现代化。随着作者条分缕析的思辩脉络，读者会逐渐感悟到几千年来陈陈相因的“非主体性价值自我”的渊薮。
    孔子最早提出“毋必”思想，让人自以为非，不要坚持己见。其后孟子、荀子等儒家的教诲更发展了对个人的意志的否定；而老庄的“圣人欲不欲”，则达到了彻底消灭个人意志的自我虚无。如果说“毋必”是意志自我在人格中的抑制，那么道家的“无为”则更成功地抑制了创造自我，极而言之，认为人生的最高境界是“吾丧我”！由此可见，包括孔、墨、荀在内的历代思想家之“有为”于社会的，无不是起劲地设置使中国人无所作为的种种规范。尽管上述思想的发挥使一些隐士贤者们于怀才不遇之际求得某种心理平衡，也多少给过古人今人们一些“高尚”的美感，但它们客观上成了历史发展的阻力。论著还认为，儒、道、佛对于中国人的价值观所起的作用是殊途同归，并将它们与西方的功利人格作了比较。对东方人悉心追求的“和谐”，文章在肯定它在民族内聚力和道德伦理方面的积极意义的同时，也对这种“泛和谐化价值目标”的历史惰性给予了评价，得出结论：“丧失主体意识，这便是中国古人和谐的价值目标”。
    诚然，寥寥十万言很难将中国的传统价值观一一论述周全，一如作者的坦率剖白：“我从心底厌恶刚柔相济这种国故经谈，倒宁肯滑向刚性的偏颇”，表现出一种哲人的执拗。
