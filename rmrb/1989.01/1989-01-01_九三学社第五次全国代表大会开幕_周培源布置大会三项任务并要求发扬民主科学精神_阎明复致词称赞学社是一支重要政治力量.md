The Fifth National Congress of the Jiusan Society opens
Zhou Peiyuan assigns three tasks to the congress and calls for the promotion of democratic and scientific spirit
Yan Mingfu delivers a speech praising the society as an important political force

BEIJING, Dec. 31 (Xinhua) — The Jiusan Society, which consists mainly of high- and middle-level intellectuals in the fields of science and technology, culture and education, and medicine and health, began its fifth national congress in Beijing today.

The Jiusan Society is one of the eight democratic parties in China. Its predecessor was the Democratic Science Discussion Society, formed by a group of progressive scholars in Chongqing during the latter part of the Anti-Japanese War. It was later renamed the "Jiusan Society" to commemorate the victory of the Anti-Japanese War and the World Anti-Fascist War on September 3, 1945.

Yan Mingfu, a member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee and head of the United Front Work Department, delivered a congratulatory speech on behalf of the CPC Central Committee. The speech said that over the long term, the Jiusan Society has made important contributions to promoting socialist construction, consolidating and expanding the patriotic united front, and developing China's science and technology and education. In promoting the reform of the science and technology and education systems, reflecting the interests and demands of intellectuals, and mobilizing their enthusiasm, the society has done a great deal of work and achieved remarkable results, winning respect and praise from society. The Jiusan Society is a close friend and ally of the Communist Party of China, fighting side by side and weathering storms together, and is an important political force in China's revolutionary and construction cause.

The speech pointed out that the revitalization and development of China's economy depend on science and technology, and the progress of science and technology depends on talent, while the cultivation of talent depends on education. The Jiusan Society has many experts and scholars and outstanding talents in the fields of science, technology, and education, and is an important force in socialist modernization construction. The speech hoped that the Jiusan Society would continue to promote its members and the intellectuals it is connected with to make new contributions to the development of China's science and technology and education, and to China's socialist modernization cause.

Lu Jiasi, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, also delivered a congratulatory speech on behalf of the other democratic parties and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce.

The congress was presided over by Yan Jizi, chairman of the Standing Committee of the Congress Presidium. Zhou Peiyuan, chairman of the Standing Committee, delivered the opening speech. He said that this congress has three tasks: first, to review the work report of the seventh central committee, summarize the achievements and new experiences, find out the shortcomings and deficiencies, and continue to move forward; second, to amend the constitution to further clarify the nature, tasks, position, and role of the Jiusan Society, and improve the organizational system of the society; third, to elect a new central leadership, and move towards a younger and more cooperative structure. He asked the 484 representatives attending the congress, representing the more than 37,000 members of the society, to hold the congress in a democratic and scientific spirit.

Xu Dehua, standing committee member of the Congress Presidium, delivered a report on behalf of the seventh central committee, titled "Carry Forward the Spirit of Democracy and Science, and Strive for the Construction of Socialism with Chinese Characteristics." Xu Dehua, after reviewing the work of the past five years, pointed out that the current task of the Jiusan Society is: under the banner of patriotism and socialism, to widely unite people in the intellectual community, adhere to democracy and science, devote itself to reform and opening up, and strive for the unification of the motherland, the rejuvenation of China, and to make China a prosperous, democratic, and civilized modernized country.

Xu Caidi, standing committee member of the Congress Presidium, explained the draft amendment to the Jiusan Society Constitution.

Tian Jiyun, Huang Zhen, Hab Zhenxun, Song Jian, Yang Jingren, and relevant department heads Peng Qingyuan, Ye Duyi, Chen Shunli, Wan Guoqian, Yang Jike, Wu Ketao, Huang Liangchen, and others attended the meeting to express their congratulations.

    新华社北京１９８８年１２月３１日电  （记者郑庆东、张严平）以科学技术和文化教育、医药卫生界高、中级知识分子为主体的九三学社，今天开始在北京举行第五次全国代表大会。
    九三学社是我国八个民主党派之一，其前身为抗日战争后期一批进步学者在重庆组成的民主科学座谈会，后为纪念１９４５年９月３日抗日战争和国际反法西斯战争的胜利，改建为“九三学社”。
    中共中央书记处书记、统战部部长阎明复代表中共中央向大会致贺词。贺词说，长期以来，九三学社为推进社会主义建设，巩固和扩大爱国统一战线，发展我国科技、教育事业，作出了重要贡献。在促进科技和教育体制改革、反映知识分子利益和要求以及调动他们的积极性等方面，做了大量工作，取得显著成绩，赢得社会的尊重和赞誉。九三学社是同中国共产党并肩战斗、风雨同舟的亲密友党，是我国革命和建设事业中一支重要的政治力量。
    贺词指出，我国经济的振兴和发展要依靠科技，而科技的进步取决于人才，人才的造就取决于教育。九三学社拥有许多专家学者和科技、教育战线上的优秀人才，是社会主义现代化建设的一支重要力量。贺词希望九三学社继续推动广大成员和所联系的知识界人士，为发展我国科技事业和教育事业，为我国社会主义现代化事业作出新的贡献。
    全国政协副主席、农工民主党中央主席卢嘉锡代表各民主党派和全国工商联也向大会致贺词。
    大会主席团常务主席严济慈主持会议。常务主席周培源致开幕词。他说，这次大会有三项任务，一是审议第七届中央委员会的工作报告，总结工作的成绩和新鲜经验，找出缺点和不足，以利继续前进；二是修改社章，进一步明确九三学社的性质、任务、地位、作用，完善社的组织制度；三是选举新的中央领导机构，向年轻化和新老合作的体制迈进。他要求代表着全社３．７万多名社员的４８４位会议代表，本着民主与科学的精神把大会开好。
    年已９９岁高龄的九三学社前中央主席许德珩卧病在床，不能参加大会。他向大会发来了一封充满感情、语重心长的信，希望九三学社的同志在各自岗位上发挥光和热。当周培源宣读这封信时，会场上不时响起热烈的掌声。
    大会主席团常务主席孙承佩代表第七届中央委员会，在会上作了题为《发扬民主科学精神，为建设有中国特色的社会主义而努力奋斗》的工作报告。孙承佩在回顾过去五年的工作后指出，九三学社现阶段的任务是：在爱国主义和社会主义的旗帜下，广泛团结知识界人士，坚持民主和科学，致力于改革开放，为统一祖国，振兴中华，使我国成为富强、民主、文明的现代化国家而奋斗。
    大会主席团常务主席徐采栋在会上作了关于《九三学社章程》修改草案的说明。
