Since the beginning of winter, Beijing University of Traditional Chinese Medicine's National Medicine Hall has been bustling with patients, many of whom are seeking treatment for urinary and gallbladder stones from Professor Liu Xingzhi. Professor Liu uses traditional Chinese medicine to inhibit the development of stone formation and promote the expulsion of stones. Over the past 20 years, he has treated 422 patients with urinary tract stones, achieving a cure rate of 68.2%. He has also treated 480 patients with gallbladder stones, with 336 of them successfully expelling the stones.

Currently, the common treatment for gallbladder stones is surgical removal. Many patients are apprehensive about this procedure because residual or regenerated stones may remain in the bile ducts post-surgery. Traditional Chinese medicine views damp-heat as a significant factor in the formation of gallbladder stones, and pathological bile is the "environment" that leads to stone formation. Treating the pathological bile ducts and changing the pathological bile is crucial for dissolving and expelling stones. This approach not only alters the environment that produces stones but also controls the growth of stones. Liu Xingzhi points out that although the common bile duct is only 0.8 centimeters in diameter, it can expand to expel very large stones.

Liu Xingzhi states that even patients with large stones in the gallbladder should not be overly worried. This is an ancient disease; a female mummy from the Western Han Dynasty unearthed in Changsha's Mawangdui had stones in her gallbladder, but she died from a heart attack.

　　刘兴志廿余年收治患者九百余
    中医疗法治尿胆石症颇有效验
    本报讯  记者李德民报道：入冬以来，北京中医学院国医堂门庭若市，其中有不少尿胆石患者来向刘兴志教授求医。刘教授采用中医疗法抑制结石症的发展，并促使结石排出。２０多年来，他收治４２２例尿路结石患者，治愈率达６８．２％；收治的４８０例胆石症患者，３３６例排石。
    目前，治疗胆石症常采用手术切除，许多患者心存恐惧，因为术后胆道里还可能留有残余结石或再生结石。中医认为，湿热是形成胆石症的重要因素，而病理胆液是形成结石的“环境”。治理好病理性胆道，改变病理性胆液，是消溶和排石的关键。这样治疗，既可改变产生结石的“环境”，又可控制结石长大。他说，别看胆总管只有０．８厘米，但扩张后可以排出很大的结石。
    刘兴志说，即使胆囊内有大结石的患者也不必忧心忡忡，这是一个古老的疾病，长沙马王堆发掘的一具西汉女尸胆囊里就有结石，但她死于心肌梗塞。
