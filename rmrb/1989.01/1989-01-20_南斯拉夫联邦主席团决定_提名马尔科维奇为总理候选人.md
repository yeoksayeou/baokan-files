The Federal Presidency of Yugoslavia today decided to nominate Ante Marković as the formal candidate for the Federal Prime Minister.

The Federal Presidency requested that Marković immediately begin consultations on organizing the new Federal Government according to the constitution, and promptly publicize the basic principles of the new Federal Government's policy platform and the criteria for selecting members of the Federal Government.

Marković was born in 1924 in Konjic. He is of Croatian ethnicity. In 1941, he participated in the People's Liberation Struggle of Yugoslavia, and in 1943, he joined the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. In 1954, he graduated from the Faculty of Technology at the University of Zagreb. He has served as the general manager of the "Rad Končar" electrical company, deputy chairman of the Economic Council of the Federal Assembly, Prime Minister of the Republic of Croatia, and chairman of the Republic's Collective Presidency. He is currently a member of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and a member of the Collective Presidency of the Republic of Croatia.

Since the collective resignation of the Federal Government led by Prime Minister Mikulić at the end of last year, the republics and autonomous provinces immediately began to consider candidates for the Federal Prime Minister, proposing more than 20 candidates.
