Famous sociologist Professor Fei Xiaotong recently told reporters that public relations is a necessary job in modern society, and China's modernization requires the development of genuine public relations.

Fei Xiaotong received reporters in a modest small building where he teaches graduate students. He pointed out some deviations in the current practice of public relations in China: "Currently, people have an incomplete understanding of public relations. Many people consider it a study of 'building personal connections.' In fact, its content is much deeper." Fei Xiaotong said, "The opposite of 'public relations' is 'private connections.' In traditional Chinese society, people know each other through private interactions. Political life, economic life, and social life all occur and operate within these 'private connections.' For example, even buying meat often requires personal connections to get good quality."

However, modern society cannot rely on personal connections for division of labor and cooperation. For example, large-scale industrial production recruits workers on a large scale, recognizing individuals as A, B, C, D, rather than recognizing specific individuals. Public relations is about coordinating division of labor and cooperation among strangers to accomplish common goals. Fei Xiaotong said, "We are now transitioning from a rural society to a modern society. We are changing ourselves and also interacting with people from modern societies. How do we cooperate effectively? How do we communicate? Therefore, studying public relations is a pressing need."

Professor Fei Xiaotong recently proposed opening a public relations course at Peking University and cultivating a group of interested individuals. Fei Xiaotong also envisioned that, if conditions permit, an international academic institution could collaborate on a public relations research project.

　　费孝通纠正对公关的一种误解    
    公共关系学不是拉关系学
    新华社北京１月２７日电（记者吴锦才、袁晞）著名社会学家费孝通教授日前与记者谈话说，公共关系是现代社会一个必要的工作，我国进行现代化生产的分工合作需要发展真正的公共关系。
    费孝通在他对研究生讲课的一座简陋小楼里接待了记者。他针对当前我国开展公共关系业务的一些偏差指出：现在人们对公关的意义有不完全的理解，许多人把它当作是“拉关系”的学问。其实它的内容很深。费孝通说，“公关”的对立面是“私交”。在中国传统的社会里，人认识人是靠私人间的接触。人们的政治生活、经济生活、社会生活是在这样的“私交”当中发生、活动的，譬如去买肉也常常要靠私人关系才买到好的。
    但是现代化社会却不能靠私人的认识进行分工合作，譬如大工业生产大规模招工，认的是甲乙丙丁，不认哪一个人。公共关系就是在不相识的人当中进行分工合作，完成共同的事业。费孝通说，我们现在正在由一个乡土社会变成为现代社会，自己在变，也接触到现代社会来的人，怎么搞好合作？怎么沟通？因此进行公共关系学的研究已是当前的现实需要。
    费孝通教授最近已在北京大学倡议开一门公共关系学的课程，同时培养出一批对此有兴趣的人。费孝通还设想，有条件的话由国际间学术机构搞成一个公关学研究的协作项目。
