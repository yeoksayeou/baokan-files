The Aviation and Aerospace Industry, which oversees more than 200 factories and enterprises, has in recent years adhered to the policy of "military products first, civilian products as the main focus." It has produced over 6,000 types of civilian products. These enterprises have strong technical capabilities, advanced production equipment, and reliable product quality. However, since most of them are located in the "third-line" mountainous areas, many good products remain unknown to the public. In light of this, the company decided to open the Beijing Hangte Commercial Center in the capital to provide a window for these enterprises to expand the sales of their civilian products. The center will also gather market information and feedback to the enterprises. The Hangte Commercial Center, located on the Beijing-Tongxian Road, officially opened on January 19.

    航空航天工业民品开发公司在京开设“窗口”
  　航空航天工业部所属２００多家工厂企业，近几年贯彻“军品第一，民品为主”的方针，生产出６０００多种民用产品。这些企业技术力量雄厚，生产设备先进，产品质量可靠。但由于它们大多处于“三线”山区，好产品往往“养在深闺人未识”。鉴于此，公司决定在首都开设北京航特商场，为这些企业扩大民品销售提供窗口，并通过商场了解市场，把信息反馈给企业。位于北京—通县公路上的航特商场已于１月１９日开业。
