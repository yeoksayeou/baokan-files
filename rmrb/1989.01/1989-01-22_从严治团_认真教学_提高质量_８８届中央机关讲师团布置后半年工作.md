The meeting of the Central Government Lecturer Team and the symposium on educational issues in old, young, remote, and poor regions concluded today in Beijing.

The 88th Central Government Lecturer Team, consisting of 1,013 members, has achieved commendable results in supporting educational work over the past half year. It is understood that 228 teaching points have been established, 16,500 teachers have been trained, 8,400 middle and primary school students have been taught, and more than 21,000 people have attended lectures. This has been warmly welcomed by the society, especially by the people in old, young, remote, and poor regions.

The attendees studied the next steps for the 88th Central Government Lecturer Team, proposing to further strengthen teaching work. According to the current educational needs and individual professional strengths, some team members' work should be appropriately adjusted to fully utilize each person's role in teaching. Whether participating in teacher training or directly teaching in classrooms, the focus should be on improving teaching quality and achieving good results. The team should be managed strictly, and the team's own construction should be further improved by establishing and perfecting various regulations. It is advocated to use spare time to understand social situations, do some social service work, and strengthen the relationship between central government agencies and local areas. Efforts should be made to popularize science and technology and combine it with local economic development.

Vice Ministers of the State Education Commission He Dongchang, Liu Bin, and Wang Mingda attended the symposium and gave speeches. This meeting was organized by the office of the Central Government Lecturer Team.
