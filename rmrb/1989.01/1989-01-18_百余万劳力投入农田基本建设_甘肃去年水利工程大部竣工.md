Since last winter, Gansu Province has mobilized over 1.1 million workers to engage in agricultural infrastructure construction. From the Hexi Corridor to the arid plateaus of Longdong, farmers across the province are actively investing in land improvement to ensure a bumper harvest this year.

Starting from last spring, the provincial, municipal, and county governments have planned and implemented a series of agricultural infrastructure projects, focusing on development-oriented construction. Especially since late November, agricultural infrastructure construction in the province has reached a peak. By late December, 1.8 billion cubic meters of work had been completed, and more than 23,100 medium and small-sized agricultural water conservancy projects listed in the 1988 plan have been basically completed. Newly developed effective irrigation areas total 135,000 mu, and the guaranteed irrigation area is 161,200 mu; 700,000 mu of "three fields" (terrace fields, check dams, and level fields) have been newly built; at the same time, drinking water problems for 261,400 people and 164,600 livestock have been solved. This is the most effective year for agricultural water conservancy construction in recent years.

To ensure that agricultural infrastructure construction this year gradually develops towards centralization, scale, village and community, and basin-wide management, the provincial government has twice arranged and implemented agricultural infrastructure construction. The main leaders of the provincial Party Committee and government have personally gone to the central and Hexi regions to carefully organize and guide the construction. Dingxi County, which is dry and lacks rain, started agricultural infrastructure construction early this year and has good momentum. The county party secretary and county magistrate each take charge of a terrace field construction project of more than 100 mu, and each township-level leader takes charge of a terrace field construction project of more than 50 mu, making the county's terrace field construction projects of more than 50 mu reach 155. The Qingyang region has mobilized 370,000 workers to concentrate their time on agricultural infrastructure construction, and the task of building 142,000 mu of terrace fields in the entire region has been overfulfilled.

To accelerate the pace of agricultural infrastructure construction in the province, the province has decided to start this year to raise the subsidy standard for building "three fields" per mu from 20 yuan to 30 yuan; and plans to allocate 10 million yuan from the newly increased fiscal revenue (increasing by 10 million yuan each year in the following years) for agricultural infrastructure construction and grain production in the Hexi Corridor. The goal is to strive, through four to five years of effort, to make the total area of "three fields" in the province reach more than 16 million mu, and the area of water fields reach more than 14 million mu.

　　百余万劳力投入农田基本建设
    甘肃去年水利工程大部竣工
    本报讯  去年入冬以来，甘肃省农村组织１１０多万劳力大搞农田水利基本建设，从河西走廊到陇东旱塬，广大农民积极向土地增加投入，力争今年农业丰收。
    从去年春天起，省、地、县三级有计划地安排落实了一批农田基本建设项目，组织有重点的建设性开发。特别是进入１１月下旬以来，全省农田基本建设进入高潮，到１２月下旬已完成工程量１．８亿立方米，列入１９８８年计划的２３１００多项中小型农田水利工程项目基本全部竣工。新发展有效灌溉面积１３．５万亩，保灌面积１６．１２万亩；新修“三田”７０万亩；同时解决了２６．１４万人和１６．４６万头牲畜的饮水困难。这是近几年以来农田水利基本建设成效最好的一年。
    为保证今年的农田基本建设逐步向集中化、规模化、村社化、流域化方向发展，省政府先后两次布置落实农田基本建设，省委、省政府主要领导深入中部和河西地区，对农田基本建设精心组织、指导。干旱少雨的定西县，今年农田基本建设动手早，势头很好，县委书记和县长每人抓一个百亩以上、乡一级领导每人抓一个５０亩以上的梯田连片点建设，使全县５０亩以上的梯田片发展到１５５个。庆阳地区组织动员３７万劳力集中时间大搞农田基本建设，全区１４．２万亩梯田的兴修任务已超额完成。
    为了加快全省农田基本建设的步伐，省里决定从今年起，把建设每亩“三田”的补助标准由２０元提高到３０元；并计划从新增财政收入中拿出１０００万元（以后几年内每年递增１０００万元），用于河西走廊的农田基本建设和粮食生产。力争经过四、五年努力，使全省“三田”总面积达到１６００万亩以上，水地面积达到１４００万亩以上。
