	Villages See a Rise in "Little Cowherds"
	"Little cowherds" were a symbol of poverty among children in old China. Illiteracy is closely linked to poverty. As the living standards of farmers improve, a new wave of "little cowherds" has emerged in the countryside.

	According to figures released at the National Literacy Conference, China currently has 220 million illiterates, making up one-fifth of the total population. Over the past three years, the number of people in rural areas who have become literate has actually decreased, with only 1.58 million doing so last year. In the past, this number was around 6 million per year. Why has this reversal occurred?

	First, there is a shortage of labor in rural areas. Since the implementation of rural economic reforms, agricultural and sideline production, as well as diversified operations, have flourished, leading to an increased demand for labor. In the countryside, labor can bring wealth, and education seems to have lost its appeal.

	Second, there is significant population mobility in rural areas. Farmers leaving to work in construction often take their entire families with them, making it impossible for their children to attend school. Large numbers of farmers have moved to cities to work as temporary laborers, and their children have also dropped out of school. Additionally, many rural girls of school age have moved to cities to work as nannies.

	Third, there is a lack of incentive to enroll in school. Although the cost of education is no longer a burden for farmers due to the implementation of compulsory education in rural areas, farmers are not enthusiastic about sending their children to school. This is because whether one is illiterate, a primary school graduate, or a middle school graduate, the ultimate path is the same: farming. The idea of becoming wealthy through technology has not been widely accepted by farmers.

### 农村又多“小放牛”

　　农村又多“小放牛”
    “小放牛”是旧中国贫穷的农家孩子的缩影。文盲跟贫穷有密切关系，随着农民生活水平的提高，农村中却涌现出大批新的“小放牛”。
    据全国扫盲工作会议上所公布的数字，中国现有文盲２．２亿人，占总人口的五分之一。近３年来，农村“脱盲”人数反而下降，去年仅有１５８万人。而过去每年倒可以有６００万人“脱盲”。为什么会出现如此反差呢？
    一、农村劳动力的短缺。自从实行农村经济改革以后，农副业生产和多种经营兴起，农村劳动力需求日益增加。在农村，劳动可以致富，上学读书似乎已不被人重视。
    二、农村人口的流动。农民外出从事建筑业，有些是举家出动，在流动性的迁移中，子女是无法入学的。大批农民进城当临时工，随他们而来的子女也就失学了。还有尚在上学年龄的农村女孩子进城当保姆。
    三、入学缺少吸引力。农村实行义务教育，尽管读书费用早已不构成农民的生活负担，但农户并不热心于让子女上学。因为不管是文盲，还是小学毕业、中学毕业，总归是一条出路：务农。技术致富的思想，并没有被农民普遍接受。
