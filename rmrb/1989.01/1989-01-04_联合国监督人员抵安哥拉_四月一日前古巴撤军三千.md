The first batch of United Nations supervisors for the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola arrived in the Angolan capital of Luanda today.

Angola, Cuba, and South Africa, with the mediation of the United States, signed a tripartite agreement in New York on December 22, 1988, to peacefully resolve the issue in southwestern Africa. Angola and Cuba simultaneously signed an agreement for the phased withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola over 27 months. At the same time, Angola and Cuba proposed to the United Nations Secretary-General that the United Nations supervise the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola. The United Nations, in response to this request, established the United Nations Angola Verification Mission, led by Brazilian General Gomes, consisting of 70 military personnel and 20 civilian personnel from 10 member countries.

According to reports, the head of the United Nations Angola Verification Mission, General Gomes, will arrive in Luanda on the 3rd with 30 members of the supervision team. Other members of the team will arrive in Angola by March to supervise the formal beginning of the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola starting April 1. Before April 1, Cuba will withdraw 3,000 troops from Angola.

　　联合国监督人员抵安哥拉
    四月一日前古巴撤军三千
    新华社罗安达１月２日电  首批联合国驻安哥拉监督古巴撤军小组的成员今天抵达安哥拉首都罗安达。
    安哥拉、古巴和南非在美国调解下于１９８８年１２月２２日在纽约签署了关于和平解决西南部非洲问题的三方协议，安哥拉和古巴同时签署古巴在２７个月内从安哥拉分阶段全部撤军的协议。与此同时，安、古向联合国秘书长提出由联合国监督古巴从安哥拉撤军的建议。联合国根据这一要求成立了联合国驻安哥拉监督小组，该小组由巴西将军戈米斯率领，并由联合国１０个成员国的７０名军人和２０名文职人员组成。
    据报道，联合国驻安哥拉监督小组负责人戈米斯将军将于３日率３０名监督小组成员抵达罗安达。该小组其他人员将于３月前来安哥拉，以便监督古巴军队从４月１日起正式开始从安哥拉撤军。４月１日前，古巴将先从安撤军３０００人。
