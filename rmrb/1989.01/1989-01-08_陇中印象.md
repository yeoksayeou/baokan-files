Longzhong, geographically, roughly includes the vast arid mountainous region east of Lanzhou and west of Tianshui in Gansu. This is one of the most barren and impoverished areas in China, with the worst natural ecology. "Longzhong is the most miserable place in the world."

I have worked in Gansu for many years, and Longzhong is a place I visit every year.

In the late 1960s, whenever I went to the countryside, I saw farmers with yellow, emaciated faces, groups of beggars, and boys and girls aged 13 or 14 who could not afford pants.

In the 1970s, when I reported on Gansu's agriculture, I couldn't help but worry. Despite the fact that people were clearly not full with just 8 liang (0.4 kg) of rationed grain per day, the queues of beggars did not stop, but we were ordered to say that farmers were "farming for the revolution" and to say, "Have a broad vision for the country, and look at the world."

Farmers in Longzhong, suffering from hunger and cold, were the first to understand and accept the Party's pragmatic line of thought at the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee. In the spring of 1979, many farmers and grassroots cadres in Longzhong had already "secretly connected" and in some places, there was a "one-night coup"—breaking away from the "communal" system that had left them hungry for many years, and "dividing land for individual farming"!

In mid-September 1988, I revisited Longzhong, traveling through Dingxi, Longxi, Tongwei, and Jingning counties.

What are the new impressions of Longzhong? In short: the changes are pleasing, but there are still hidden concerns.

Change one: Farmers are basically full, and there are almost no more people without pants. The villages and households I chose to visit this time are the same ones I visited 10 years ago. Among them, three villages are the poorest in their respective counties. The changes are obvious. Of the 14 households I surveyed, 3 have old grain reserves; 4 have enough to eat; and 7 are short of 1-5 months' worth of grain. This confirms that the Dingxi Regional Committee's statement that 70% of farmers have enough to eat and 30% are short of grain is accurate. The 14 farmers I interviewed have not begged for food in nearly 10 years. They all said: "Now we have grain in our hands and our hearts are at ease. If we work hard, we can have a good life."

Change two: Farmers basically no longer uproot grass for fuel, and some hills and ridges have turned green. In the past, in Longzhong, from the little shepherds to the elderly women with bound feet, everyone carried a bamboo basket in their left hand and a small hoe in their right, and wherever they saw grass roots, they would uproot them. They used grass roots to cook, boil water, and heat the kang (traditional heated bed). This time, I did not see such an "ecological destruction army." Many farmers' courtyards are piled with old wheat stalks and willow branches, with fuel reserves. Some farmers said, "There are still people who uproot grass, but it's good for heating the kang. However, most people no longer do it." Dingxi Regional Committee Secretary Han Zhengqing said: Since 1983, 270,000 households, or more than 90% of farmers, have had their stoves modified, saving more than one-third of fuel. Large-scale planting of willows and firewood forests, supplying coal, and promoting solar stoves—these four measures together have effectively solved the farmers' fuel problem and basically stopped the destruction of natural vegetation. I was pleased to see that some of the barren hills from 10 years ago are now covered with shrubs and wild grasses. The 40-kilometer-long stretch of road on both sides of the New Jingning Township in Tongwei County has 80,000 mu (533 hectares) of wolfberry forest that has been closed off. The county forestry bureau chief said that this is the result of continuous planting for three years and good management after the Party Central Committee issued the "plant grass and trees" slogan in 1983.

Change three: Farmers no longer endure hardship passively but are starting to find ways out. Although Longzhong is harsh, in the past, farmers had a strong sense of isolation and were generally unwilling to leave, saying, "Even a golden nest is not as good as one's own grass nest," and "I'd rather die than leave." In the past 10 years, under the government's call and organization, and with the encouragement of some brave individuals, the surplus rural labor force has begun to engage in urban sideline industries and has started to work outside the province. Among Dingxi's 2.26 million farmers, more than 130,000 have gone out for labor services last year, earning more than 57 million yuan. I saw that small county towns that had no industry in the past now have township enterprises sprouting up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. Brick and tile factories, vermicelli factories, wolfberry wine factories, carpet factories, frozen rabbit meat processing factories, fur factories, etc., are all processing industries based on local planting and breeding industries, with resource advantages and broad markets. Weaving carpets is a handcrafted processing industry that has become popular in various counties in Longzhong. Processing points are not only popular in many townships but have also entered some households. Dingxi County Carpet Factory has more than 1,800 farmer workers, earning more than 1.5 million US dollars in foreign exchange annually. The path forward is being extended under the feet of Longzhong farmers.

The changes are indeed pleasing, but there are still many hidden concerns. These can mostly be reflected in the opinions of local officials and the masses.

Opinion one: "Why do your government policies keep changing?" "The central leaders care about our Dingxi, and they have come several times. The call to plant grass and trees is also loud, but why has it been less enthusiastic in the past two years? The subsidies for planting grass and trees have also been gradually reduced. I heard that there will be none next year? Planting grass and trees is right! You reporters should speak up!"

Opinion two: "Why do government prices keep rising, but not the prices of our farmers' products?" "Pigs, traders buy pigs at 1.7-1.8 yuan per catty (0.5 kg), but the food company buys them at only 1.3-1.4 yuan. They say city people don't have meat to eat, and the government has issued procurement tasks. Why should city people eat meat at the expense of farmers?" "Even so, we need fertilizer, pesticides, and plastic film. The state cannot supply them, and they are all resold by city people, raising prices and cheating farmers' money. Why can't the state control this?"

Opinion three: "The rural policies of the past 10 years have been good, and we don't want them to change. Some people say they want to implement large-scale management. How can we manage on a large scale? We still don't understand, is it going to be collective again?"

In summary, what Longzhong farmers want is a pragmatic policy with continuity and stability, as well as a good social and economic order.

　　陇中印象
    新华社记者  邓全施
    陇中，地理范围大致包括甘肃兰州以东、天水以西的大片干旱山区。这是中国一块最贫瘠困苦、自然生态最恶劣的地方。“陇中苦，甲天下”。
    记者在甘肃工作多年，陇中是每年必去。
    ６０年代末，记者每到乡下，见到的是面黄饥瘦的农民，成群结队的讨饭队伍，和十三四岁还穿不上裤子的男女少年。
    ７０年代，记者报道甘肃农业，没法子不犯愁。明明是一天８两返销粮吃不饱，外流讨饭的队伍连年不断，但却奉命说农民“为革命种田”，还要说：“胸怀祖国，放眼全球”。
    饥寒中的陇中农民，最容易理解和接受党的十一届三中全会实事求是的思想路线。１９７９年春天，陇中许多农民和基层干部已“暗中串连”，有的地方“一夜政变”——摆脱多年吃不饱的“公社化”体制，“分田单干”了！
    １９８８年９月中旬，记者重访陇中，走了定西、陇西、通渭、静宁四县。
    陇中的新印象是什么？概言之：变化可喜，隐忧仍在。
    变化之一：农民基本上吃饱了，没裤子穿的朋友基本上没有了。记者此行选择参观的乡村及农户，都是１０年前去过的。其中三个村子是各县中最贫困的。前后对比，变化明显。记者看察的１４户，有陈年存粮的３户；够吃的４户；缺１—５个月粮的７户。由此证实，定西地委说农民７０％够吃了，３０％缺粮，是准确的。所访问的１４户农民，近１０年没有外流乞讨。他们都说：现在手里有粮了，心里不慌了，好好做就能过好光阴。
    变化之二：农民基本上不铲草根烧了，有少数山头梁峁绿了。记者过去看到的陇中，从放羊的小娃娃，到六七十岁的小脚老太婆，无不左手挽个竹篮子，右手拿把小铲子，田头地埂，山坡梁顶，见草根就铲。煮饭、烧水、煨炕，都烧草根。此行没有看到这样的“生态破坏大军”，许多农民场院里堆着陈年的麦秸、草木樨杆，燃料有所储备。有些农民说：“铲草的还有哩，煨炕要草皮好。不过多数人不铲了。”定西地委书记韩正卿说：１９８３年以来把２７万农户即９０％以上的农户，锅灶都改造了，节省燃料１／３以上。大量种植草木樨和薪炭林，供应煤炭，推广太阳灶，这四项措施一齐上，所以较好地解决了农民燃料困难问题，也就基本上停止了对自然植被的破坏。记者欣喜地看到，１０年前的一些干山枯岭，现在覆盖着灌木和野草。通渭县新景乡的马湾梁一带，４０多公里长的公路两边，连绵的山头上有８万多亩沙棘林已育成封闭。县林业局长说，这是１９８３年党中央提出“种草种树”的口号后，连续栽种３年，又管护得好，才有了这片林。
    变化之三：农民不再苦守苦熬，开始想办法找出路了。陇中虽苦，但过去农民封闭意识强，大多不愿外出，说是“金窝银窝不如自家的草窝”，“打死也不出门”。近１０年来，农村剩余劳动力在政府的号召和组织下，在一些勇敢分子的带动下，开始进城搞工副业了，开始出省搞劳务了。定西２２６万农民中，去年已有１３万多劳务输出挣回了５７００多万元钱。记者看到，过去没有工业的小县城，现在乡镇企业如雨后春笋般“冒”出来。砖瓦厂、粉丝厂、沙棘酒厂、地毯厂、冷冻兔肉加工厂、皮毛厂等等，都是立足于当地种植业和养殖业基础上的加工业，有资源优势，有广阔市场。织地毯，是陇中各县已普及的手工加工业。加工网点不仅普及许多乡，而且进入到一些农户了。定西县地毯厂有１８００多农民工人，年创汇１５０多万美元。出路，正在陇中农民的脚下四处延伸。
    变化固然可喜，却有不少隐忧。这大都能从当地干部和群众的意见中反映出来。
    意见之一：“你们公家的政策咋老是变来变去哩？”“中央领导同志关心咱定西，前后来了好几趟。种草种树的号召也叫得响亮，这二年咋叫得不起劲了？种草种树的补助款也逐年减少了？听说明年不给了？种草种树，对着的嘛！你们记者喊一喊吧！”
    意见之二：“你们公家的东西啥都涨哩，为啥咱农民的东西不让涨？”“猪，贩子收猪一斤毛重一块七八，食品公司收才一块三四。说城里人没肉吃，政府下了派购任务。为啥城里人吃肉要咱农民贴钱？”“就这样也行，可我们要化肥、农药、地膜，国家供应不了，还尽叫城里人倒来倒去，抬价坑咱农民的钱，国家为啥管不住呢？”
    意见之三：“这１０来年农村政策好着哩，再不要变。有的人来说要搞规模经营，咋规模法？我们还不太懂，是不是又要闹集体？”
    总而言之，陇中农民所要求的，是实事求是的政策及其连续性和稳定性，是社会和经济环境的良好秩序。
