The Beijing Male Infertility Treatment Center, located on Chaoyang District's Zaoying Road next to the Great Wall Hotel, was established today.

This center is a joint venture between the Zunyi City Male Infertility Research Institute of Guizhou Province and the 292nd Hospital of the People's Liberation Army. It primarily uses the pure Chinese herbal formula "Shengjing San," developed by Dr. Zeng Chaowen, to treat conditions such as low sperm count, poor viability, low motility, and abnormalities. The center has 50 high-grade beds available for both domestic and international patients, with a typical treatment course lasting over a month.

According to Dr. Zeng Chaowen, the Zunyi Male Infertility Research Institute plans to establish three centers domestically. The center in Guangzhou has already been established, and Beijing is the second. A third center is planned for Shanghai. Internationally, two centers will be established by the Zunyi Male Infertility Research Institute, one in Singapore and another in the United Arab Emirates.

    本报北京１月１７日讯  记者冯军军报道：位于北京朝阳区枣营路长城饭店东侧的北京男性不育症治疗中心，今天成立。
    这个中心是由贵州省遵义市男性不育症研究所和解放军２９２医院联合创办的。它采用曾超文医生潜心研制的纯中药制剂“生精散”为主要治疗方法，对精子数量减少、成活率低、活动度差、畸形等症效果良好。目前，该中心设有５０张高级病床对中外患者开放，一般疗程为一月余。
    据曾超文介绍，贵州遵义男性不育症研究所计划在国内联办３个中心，其中在广州的中心已成立，北京是第二个，还将在上海创办第三个。国外也将出现两个由遵义男性不育症研究所设立的治疗中心，一个在新加坡，一个在阿拉伯联合酋长国。
