The White House said today that the U.S. hopes the Soviet Union will adhere to the Geneva Agreement and withdraw all its troops from Afghanistan by February 15.

Earlier today, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister and Ambassador to Afghanistan Yuri Vorontsov said that the Soviet Union is unlikely to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan on schedule. He accused the Afghan resistance forces of being "uncooperative."

White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the U.S. still hopes the Soviet Union will withdraw its troops by the date specified in the Geneva Agreement. He said the Soviet Union has "no valid reason" not to complete the withdrawal by February 15.

Fitzwater said the key first step in politically resolving the Afghan problem is the complete withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan by February 15. However, he said the Soviet Union has resumed its withdrawal in recent days.

The Soviet Union announced last autumn that it had withdrawn half of its 100,000 troops stationed in Afghanistan.

The first deputy foreign minister of the Soviet Union and ambassador to the Kabul regime, Vorontsov, said today that it is premature to discuss the timetable for the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan. The Soviet Union will have to see how the situation develops regarding negotiations for a political solution to the Afghan problem and the cessation of military actions.

Vorontsov made these remarks in response to a question at a press conference about whether the Soviet Union could complete its withdrawal plan by February 15. He expressed concern that it might not be possible to complete what the Soviet Union had decided in principle to do in the near future. Vorontsov, in discussing his recent visits to Iran and Pakistan, said that the Soviet Union and these two countries agree that the Afghan problem cannot be solved by force and can only be resolved politically. He said that political resolution is very realistic as long as the relevant parties act wisely.

He believes that the most important task for Afghanistan now is to stop the bloodshed and start building a government that includes all parties involved in the conflict and major political forces.

Vorontsov expressed regret over the decision by the "Seven Party Alliance" in Afghanistan not to meet with the Soviet side. However, he said that if the "Seven Party Alliance" turns to negotiate with the Kabul regime of Najibullah and resolves the problem among Afghans themselves, that would also be good.

He expressed dissatisfaction with the U.S.'s lack of "positive assistance" in resolving the Afghan problem. He said that although the U.S. appears to be taking a wait-and-see attitude, military aid to the Afghan opposition has not stopped.

　　美希望苏按时从阿富汗撤军
    苏官员表示今后撤军将视事态发展而定
    新华社华盛顿１月１０日电  白宫今天说，美希望苏将遵守日内瓦协议，在２月１５日之前从阿富汗撤出其全部军队。
    苏联外交部副部长兼驻阿富汗大使尤里·沃龙佐夫今天早些时候说，苏联很可能不会按时从阿富汗撤军。他指责阿富汗抵抗力量“不合作”。
    白宫发言人雷德曼说，美国仍然希望苏联按日内瓦协议规定的日期撤军。他说，苏联“毫无理由不能在２月１５日前把军队撤完。”
    雷德曼说，政治解决阿富汗问题的“关键的第一步”是苏联军队在２月１５日之前从阿富汗全部撤走。不过他说，苏联已在几天前恢复了撤军。
    苏联于去年秋季宣布已从阿富汗撤出１０万驻军的一半。
    新华社莫斯科１月１０日电　苏联外交部第一副部长兼驻喀布尔政权大使沃龙佐夫今天说，现在谈论驻阿苏军的撤离时间表为时尚早，苏联要看看在政治解决阿富汗问题方面进行谈判和停止军事行动等问题上事态将如何发展。
    沃龙佐夫是在记者招待会上回答苏联能否于２月１５日前完成撤军计划这一问题时说这番话的。他表示，苏联担心近期无法完成它原则上已决定要做的事。沃龙佐夫在谈到他最近伊朗和巴基斯坦之行时说，苏联与这两个国家都认为，阿富汗问题不可能以武力解决，只能政治解决。他说，只要有关各方采取明智态度，政治解决是非常现实的。
    他认为阿富汗现在最主要的任务是停止流血，着手建立有冲突各方和各主要政治力量参加的政府。
    沃龙佐夫对阿富汗“七党联盟”不再同苏方会晤的决定表示遗憾，不过他说，如果“七党联盟”转而同纳吉布拉的喀布尔政权会谈，由阿富汗人自己解决问题，那也很好。
    他对目前美国在解决阿富汗问题上“未给予积极协助”表示不满。他说，美国表面上虽持观望态度，但给阿富汗反对派的军事援助并没有停止过。
