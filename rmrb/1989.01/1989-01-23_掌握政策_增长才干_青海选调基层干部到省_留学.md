In the Qinghai provincial government offices, it is common to see some middle-aged and young cadres with dark red faces and robust physiques. It is understood that these are minority grassroots cadres who have been undergoing rotation training in various bureaus of the provincial government for several months and are about to return to their work positions.

These 30 cadres come from 6 prefectures and regions, including Tibetan, Mongolian, Hui, Tu, Salar, and Han ethnicities. They refer to their time in various provincial bureaus as "practicing," calling it "studying in the province, with a term of half a year."

Among the "studying" cadres, many are stepping out of the grasslands for the first time. Due to long-term work in high-altitude pastoral areas, their political vision and ideological concepts are relatively closed off. As reserve cadres, they urgently need to improve. The relevant bureaus of the provincial government have formulated a training plan, requiring the cadres undergoing rotation training to take on jobs and participate in important meetings.

Over the past few months, this group of cadres has become familiar with what was once unfamiliar to them. They have not only mastered policies but also enhanced their skills. A county committee secretary from Yushu, for example, has changed his habit of "talking more, writing less." During his training period, he published two articles in provincial journals and newspapers and wrote an 8,000-word economic paper.

　　掌握政策　增长才干    
    青海选调基层干部到省“留学”
    本报西宁１月２２日电  记者郅振璞报道：在青海省直机关，常可见到一些脸膛黑红、体魄健壮的中青年干部。据悉，这是在省直机关轮岗锻炼数月的少数民族基层干部，即将届满返回工作岗位。
    这些干部共３０人，来自６个州和地区，有藏、蒙古、回、土、撒拉、汉等民族，他们称到省直各厅局“见习”，为“上省留学，学制半年”。
    “留学”干部中不少人是第一次走出草原。由于长期在高原牧区，政治视野和思想观念相对封闭，作为后备干部亟需提高。省直有关厅局制定了代培计划，受轮岗锻炼的干部要求顶岗工作，参加重要会议。
    几个月来，这批干部已熟悉了原曾陌生的一切。既掌握了政策，又增长了才干。来自玉树的一位县委书记，改变了“动口不动笔”习惯，锻炼期间在省刊、省报发表两篇文章，写了一篇８０００字的经济学论文。
