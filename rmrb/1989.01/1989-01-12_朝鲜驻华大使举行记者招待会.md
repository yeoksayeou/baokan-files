North Korean Ambassador Holds Press Conference

New China News Agency, Beijing, January 11 - The North Korean Ambassador to China, Chu Changjun, held a press conference this morning in Beijing regarding Kim Il-sung's new policy on national reunification as outlined in his New Year's address.

Chu Changjun stated that in his New Year's address, Kim Il-sung emphasized that the North and South should first take effective measures to eliminate political and military confrontation, thereby opening a breakthrough for mutual trust and unity as soon as possible. Chairman Kim also pointed out that if the South Korean authorities respond to the North's efforts and show a willingness to change their policies, they should at least clearly express their intention not to hold the "Spirit of Cooperation" joint military exercises this year. Kim Il-sung further suggested that this year, a consensus should be reached on the path to resolving the reunification issue among the entire nation, and proposed holding a North-South political consultation conference in the near future in Pyongyang, attended by leaders from various parties and sectors representing both the North and the South.

Ambassador Chu Changjun said that Kim Il-sung's proposal to hold a political consultation conference with leaders from both the North and the South is "the most feasible way to concentrate national sentiment and reach a consensus on the path to reunification under current conditions."

Chu Changjun also expressed gratitude to socialist countries like China, non-aligned countries, and people around the world for their active support for the Korean people's just struggle for national independence and peaceful reunification.

　　朝鲜驻华大使举行记者招待会
    新华社北京１月１１日电  朝鲜驻华大使朱昌骏今天上午在此间就金日成主席在新年贺词中提出统一祖国的新方针举行了记者招待会。
    朱昌骏说，金日成主席在新年贺词中强调，北方和南方应首先采取消除政治军事对抗状态的有效措施，从而打开尽早实现相互信赖和团结的突破口。金主席还指出，南朝鲜当局如有响应北方的努力和改变政策的用意，那起码也要明确表示今年不举行“协作精神”联合军事演习的态度。金日成主席又指出今年要对解决统一问题的途径达到全民族一致意见，并建议近期内在平壤举行由北方和南方能够代表各党派、各界意向的领导人士参加的北南政治协商会议。
    朱昌骏大使说，金日成主席提出的关于举行北南领导人士参加的政治协商会议，“是在目前条件下最容易集中民族意向的民族对话的场合，是能够对统一途径达成民族一致意见的合情合理的方法”。
    朱昌骏还对中国等社会主义国家和不结盟国家以及世界人民对朝鲜人民争取祖国自主和平统一的正义斗争所给予的积极支持表示感谢。
