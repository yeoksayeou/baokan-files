The Dalian People's Price Supervision Team, which has been praised by Premier Li Peng, has, in the half year since its establishment, handled over 600 cases of disciplinary violations, uncovering over 1.5 million yuan in violations, of which over 700,000 yuan has been returned to the national treasury.

Last June, the Dalian municipal government selected 200 people from government departments, people's representatives, members of the political consultative conference, retired cadres, intellectuals, and employees of enterprises and institutions to form the People's Price Supervision Team. This team is dedicated to supervising and inspecting the market and prices. Since they come from the people, they understand the people's concerns and can focus on issues closely related to people's lives for supervision and inspection. Last July, there were many complaints from the public about issues such as short-weighting and substandard pork in the market. The Price Supervision Team dispatched nearly 1,000 personnel in a week to conduct six large-scale inspections of over 300 pork sales outlets across the city, handling 138 cases of disciplinary violations and stabilizing the pork market.

The Dalian municipal government has granted the Price Supervision Team the authority to inspect and handle cases. The city's top leaders support them, enabling this team to dare to tackle difficult issues. A company under the Dalian municipal government was found to be illegally profiting by over 200,000 yuan from the resale of scarce production materials like pure soda. The public had many complaints. During the inspection, many people came to plead on behalf of the company, but the team firmly handled the case. In the past half year, they have handled 24 similar cases and collected 415,000 yuan in fines.

The Dalian People's Price Supervision Team also conducts price and market investigations, actively reporting price trends and market dynamics to government departments, and proposing suggestions for strengthening macro-control. Last October, this supervision team inspected and handled the issue of overcharging in the medical sector. At the same time, they conducted a survey of the medical market and submitted a report titled "Current Situation and Countermeasures for Overcharging by Medical Institutions in Dalian" to the municipal government. Mayor Wei Fuhai praised the People's Price Supervision Team as the "eyes of the government in understanding the market."

　　大连人民物价监察队成果显著
    成立半年查处违纪案件六百多起
    新华社大连电  （记者李小林）曾受到李鹏总理称赞的大连市人民物价监察队成立半年来，已查处违纪案件６００多起，查出违纪金额１５０多万元，其中收缴国库７０多万元。
    去年６月，大连市政府从政府部门和人民代表、政协委员、离退休老干部、知识分子及企事业单位的职工中抽调２００人，组成了人民物价监察队，专门监督检查市场和物价。他们来自群众，最了解群众的呼声，能够抓住与人民生活密切相关的问题进行监督检查。去年７月，群众对市场上猪肉短斤缺两、以次充好等现象反映较大，物价监察队就在一星期内出动近千人次，对全市３００多个猪肉销售门点进行６次大范围检查，共查处１３８个违纪门点，稳定了猪肉市场。
    大连市政府赋予物价监察队检查权和处理权。市政府主要领导为他们撑腰，使这支队伍敢于碰硬，敢于触及“难点”。大连市政府一家公司倒卖纯碱等紧俏生产资料，非法获利２０多万元，群众反映很大。监察队在检查中，很多人上门讲情，但他们坚决查处。半年来，他们查处２４起类似案件，收缴罚款４１．５万元。
    大连市人民物价监察队还开展物价与市场调查，积极向政府部门反映物价和市场动向，提出加强宏观控制的建议。去年１０月，这个监察队对医疗行业乱收费的问题进行了检查和查处，同时，对医疗市场进行了调查，向市政府写出《大连医疗单位乱收费现状及对策》调查报告，大连市长魏富海称赞人民物价监察队是“政府了解市场的眼睛”。
