    Located at the southern foot of the Zhongtiao Mountains, Xia County in Shanxi Province has seen 29 home movie theaters established by individual farmers, which has livened up the cultural life of the local people.

    Xia County has a total of 255 natural villages. After 1978, the county's film teams expanded to 178, with each village averaging over 80 film screenings per year. In recent years, rural areas have been unable to use public funds to cover movie expenses, and some villages have adopted a collective funding method where everyone, regardless of whether they watch or not, contributes based on the number of people, households, or acres of land. However, this method is difficult to implement in some villages. Two-thirds of the county's rural film teams have ceased operations due to the inability to pay film rental fees.

    Last year, Xia County Film Company reformed its traditional operating methods and actively encouraged and supported individual farmers to invest in establishing home movie theaters. In Xijin Village, Hu Zhang Township, which is more than 15 kilometers away from the county seat, it is inconvenient for residents to watch movies. The village's young farmer, Liu Bin, invested over 3,000 yuan to purchase a projector and a generator along with other necessary equipment, and started screening movies in his courtyard. In just four months, he screened 40 films, earning 2,000 yuan. After deducting film rental and management fees, he makes a pure profit of 200 yuan per month.

　　夏县农民办家庭电影院
    本报讯  地处中条山南麓的山西省夏县，已有农民个人投资创办的家庭电影院２９个，活跃了群众文化生活。
    夏县共２５５个自然村。１９７８年以后，这个县电影队发展到１７８个，每个村每年平均放映电影达８０多场。近年来，农村无法用公益金开支电影费用，一度采取按人头、按户头、按地亩看不看都均摊的集资包场放映方式，在一些村也难以实行。全县２／３的农村电影队因缴不起片租费而停止了活动。
    去年，夏县电影公司改革传统经营方式，积极鼓励、扶持农民个人投资创办家庭电影院。胡张乡西晋村距离县城１５多公里，群众看电影很不方便。该村青年农民刘斌投资３０００余元，购买了放映机和发电机等全套设备，在自家院里放电影。开业４个月就放映４０场，收入达２０００元。除片租、管理费等开支外，每个月纯收入２００元。
