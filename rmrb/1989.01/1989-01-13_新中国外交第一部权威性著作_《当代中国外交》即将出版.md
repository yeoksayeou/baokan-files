The first authoritative work on New China's diplomacy, "Contemporary Chinese Diplomacy," is set to be published. According to a report from our newspaper, "Contemporary Chinese Diplomacy" is a volume in the large series "Contemporary China." It is the first authoritative work on New China's diplomacy. This book will be publicly distributed by the Chinese Social Sciences Press.

"Contemporary Chinese Diplomacy" is composed of four parts and 35 chapters, with appendices containing important diplomatic documents and materials. The entire book totals 480,000 words. The book briefly introduces the characteristics and developments of the international situation over the past 38 years (1949 to 1986), summarizes the evolution and current state of China's relations with various countries around the world, and systematically expounds on how New China's diplomacy has withstood the severe tests of international vicissitudes, making tremendous contributions to defending China's independence and sovereignty, opposing hegemonism, and maintaining world peace. The book specially selects and includes 259 illustrations from various historical periods (many of which are historical treasures published for the first time), accompanied by brief textual explanations. This book is rigorous in its views, seeks truth from facts, and is rich in materials, reflecting the true historical appearance. It is a must-read for those engaged in foreign affairs, as well as an important reference book for the study of Chinese diplomatic history and international relations.

The book's editorial committee is chaired by Han Nianlong, with Qian Qichen, Zheng Weizhi, and Zhou Nan serving as vice-chairmen.
