	Reflections on Euthanasia
		By Dong Le Shan

	The discussion in the newspaper about euthanasia reminded me of the English-Hungarian writer Arthur Koestler, who five years ago took his life along with his wife by taking an overdose of sleeping pills.

	Koestler was 77 years old and suffered from leukemia and Parkinson's disease. He took his life along with his wife, who was more than 20 years younger than him. They left a note instructing the maid to call the police the next morning. When the police from Scotland Yard arrived, they found the elderly couple sitting in their armchairs in the living room, already deceased. Strictly speaking, this might not be considered euthanasia, at least not for Koestler's wife. However, in the West, there is a specific term for this called "dignified death" (this clumsy translation, like euthanasia, does not fully convey the original meaning of the words). In Britain, there is an organization called "Exit" (or translated as "Departure"), whose purpose is to uphold the right to a "dignified death." Koestler and his wife were both members of this organization.

	Arthur Koestler is relatively unknown in China because his works have never been introduced here. However, in the Western intellectual community, he is a fairly well-known writer. In the exciting 1930s, amidst the various political movements in Europe, Arthur Koestler was not only an active participant but also, through his work "Darkness at Noon," became a historian recording the Great Purge in the Soviet Union and the mental state of many old Bolsheviks as they faced humiliation and death. This book, published half a century ago, still resonates deeply with readers today, perhaps because many of us had similar experiences during the Cultural Revolution.

	When this book was first published, it caused a sensation in the West but was largely ignored in the East, which is understandable given the historical context of the time.

	However, after half a century, people have developed a more objective historical perspective. Even in the Soviet Union, there have been recent efforts to reassess the merits and demerits of figures like Stalin and Bukharin. "Darkness at Noon" can now finally be freed from the blind prejudices that have obscured it for fifty years. Of course, as a far-sighted thinker who cared deeply about human destiny, Koestler would not have been concerned with such posthumous vindication. Otherwise, he would not have chosen to die with dignity and faced death with equanimity. But as contemporaries who have survived, seeing history render a just verdict in our lifetime is somewhat unexpected.

　　由安乐死想起
    董乐山
    报上关于安乐死的讨论，使我想起了五年前夫妇双双服安眠药辞世的英籍匈裔作家阿瑟·库斯勒。
    库斯勒是在７７岁高龄因患白血病和帕金逊氏症不治而同比他小２０多岁的妻子一起自尽的。他们服药后留下一张条子，嘱次日清晨前来收拾房间的女佣报警。待苏格兰场警察闻讯赶到，只见老夫妇两人端坐在客厅的安乐椅上，已溘然长逝了。从严格的意义上来说，这也许不能算是安乐死，至少就库斯勒的妻子来说是如此。但是在西方，这有一个专门的说法叫“尊严死”（这个拙劣译法同安乐死一样都不能完全表达两词的原来含义），英国还有一个名叫“退场”（或译“辞世”）的团体，其宗旨就是维护这种“尊严死的权利”。库斯勒夫妇生前都是这个团体的会员。
    阿瑟·库斯勒在中国鲜为人知，这是因为他的作品从来没有介绍到中国来过。但是在西方知识界，他却是个有相当知名度的作家。因为在那激动人心的３０年代，在欧洲各种政治运动的此起彼伏之中，阿瑟·库斯勒不仅是个积极的参与者，而且也由于他的作品《中午的黑暗》而成为一个历史的纪录者。他所纪录的是苏联的大清洗和许多老布尔什维克在大清洗中受尽屈辱后死时的心态。此书出版至今，时间虽然已过半个世纪，但今天读来仍撼人心弦，也许是因为在十年浩劫中我们之中许多人也有过类似经历的缘故。
    此书出版之初，在西方轰动一时，在东方却受到冷落，鉴于当时的历史背景这是不足为奇的。
    但是经过半个世纪时间的推移，世人具有了比较客观的历史的眼光，甚至在苏联国内最近也开始对斯大林和布哈林等的是非功过作重新估计，《中午的黑暗》今天终于可以抹去蒙了五十年的盲目偏见的尘埃。当然，作为一个高瞻远瞩的关心人类命运的思想家，库斯勒是不会在乎这种死后的洗雪的，否则他也不会采取“尊严死”的死法而视死如归了。但是作为幸存的同时代人，看到历史能够在他们有生之年就作出公正判决，恐怕不免会感到有些意外吧。
