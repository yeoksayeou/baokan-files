Recently, at the 1988 China Dance Drama Observation and Discussion Meeting held in Beijing, the Beijing Military Region presented a new work titled "Impressions of Cao Yu's Works," created and starring Hua Chao. The audience, primarily college students, responded enthusiastically, while professional critics had mixed opinions. Supporters praised it as a groundbreaking success, while detractors scoffed, "What kind of dance drama is this? I can't understand it." Hua Chao, however, said: "Chinese dance dramas need to be created at a higher cultural level with a scientific mindset. Past creative attitudes have been too rigid."

Hua Chao graduated with honors from the Anhui Provincial Art School in 1971. However, his short stature became a fatal flaw for a male dancer.

He was assigned to a Beijing opera troupe to play minor roles. Fortunately, the deputy director of the Frontline Song and Dance Troupe, Xu Bing, had a keen eye for talent and allowed him to return to his original profession of dance by wearing a military uniform.

In 1980, when the elite of the national dance world gathered in Dalian for the first national dance competition, Hua Chao became one of the shining new stars. He transformed his masterful and effortless high-difficulty techniques into full-body expressions, vividly portraying the image of a fearless soldier. The male solo dance "Hope," which he co-created and starred in, condensed the psychological journey of the Chinese nation after a decade of suffering. At the age of 23, Hua Chao became the champion of the adult male group.

Once famous, flowers, praise, and overseas visits became commonplace. Faced with these, Hua Chao always maintained a casual demeanor. He planted the seeds of his ideals in classrooms and rehearsal halls. In 1984, Hua Chao and his partner Hu Xiafei, with the support of the Song and Dance Troupe and the Military Region Cultural Department, established the China Modern Dance Experimental Team to conduct a complete system of teaching, choreography, and performance experiments. They created several modern dance works, including "Fanu" and "Youth." In 1986, this dance performance evening was sold out at the Shenzhen Sports Stadium, with tickets priced at 10 yuan.

Hua Chao has also experienced heartache and disappointment, but he always says to others: "I am still a lucky child of the reform era." He then moved from the Frontline Song and Dance Troupe to the Comrades-in-Arms Song and Dance Troupe. At the age of 31, he is more confident in both society and himself. After coming to Beijing, he quickly established a new topic: adapting outstanding literary masterpieces since the May Fourth Movement, continuing to focus on the anti-feudal theme, taking the form of Chinese modern dance, and performing a three-act middle-sized dance drama with 11 actors. "Thunderstorm" is an impression of character personalities; "The Wild" is an impression of character mental states; "Sunrise" is an impression of character emotions. Three aspects merge into a solemn theme; a unique structural method; not relying on existing dance materials and technical norms, completely deriving and creating dance language from the theme, intention, and characters. The three works have a unified tone but are handled differently.

Recently, Hua Chao has been specially invited by the Hong Kong Dance Troupe to be a guest choreographer, collaborating with the troupe's artistic director Shu Qiao to rehearse the large-scale dance drama "Love Between the Sun and the Moon" with a mythical theme. He believes: "The value of life is not in the final appearance and fixed posture but in the process of creation, so he is very willing to share his insights from the process with readers and audiences."

　　舞蹈和生命价值
    ——记舞蹈家华超
    史大里
    不久前，在北京举行的１９８８年中国舞剧观摩和研讨会中，北京军区推出了华超创作主演的一台新作《曹禺作品印象》。以当代大学生为主的观众反响热烈；专业评论却各持一端。赞美者说：这是突破性的成功，贬斥者曰：这叫什么舞剧，看不懂。而华超说：中国的舞剧要在更高的文化层次上以科学的思维去进行，以往的创作心态太拘谨了。
    华超，１９７１年毕业于安徽省艺术学校，成绩优异。但是，个子矮小成了男性舞员的致命弱点。
    他被分配到京剧团去跑龙套。总算前线歌舞团副团长徐冰克慧眼识才，让他穿上军装，回到舞蹈本行。
    １９８０年，当全国舞蹈界的精英云集大连市参加首届全国舞蹈比赛时，华超成为耀眼的几颗新星之一。他把娴熟自如的高难技巧化为全身的表情动作，栩栩如生地刻画了一个无畏战士的形象。他参予创作并主演的男子独舞《希望》，凝炼出承受了十年痛苦的中华民族的心理历程。２３岁的华超成为成年男子组冠军。
    一旦成名，鲜花、赞美、出国访问成了家常便饭。面对这些，华超总是一副散漫的常态，他把理想的种子播在教室、排练厅里。１９８４年华超与伙伴胡霞菲，在歌舞团和军区文化部的支持下成立了中国现代舞实验小队，进行教、编、演完整体系的实验，创作出了《繁漪》、《青春》等一台中国现代舞作品。１９８６年这台舞蹈作品专场晚会在深圳体育馆演出，十块钱的票价也抢售一空。
    华超也伤心气馁过，但他逢人便说：我还是改革年代的幸运儿。他又从前线歌舞团到了战友歌舞团。他今年３１岁，在而立之年他更对社会和自我都充满自信。来到北京后，他很快又确立了新的课题：对“五四”以来的优秀文学名作改编，继续抓住反封建的主题，取中国现代舞的形式，由１１个演员演出一台三部曲式的中小型舞剧。《雷雨》是人物性格印象；《原野》是人物心态印象；《日出》是人物情绪印象。三个侧面溶合于一个凝重的主题；特殊的结构方式；不依赖现有的舞蹈素材和技术规范，完全从主题、立意、人物出发提炼创造舞蹈语言。三个作品既有内在统一的格调又有各自相异的处理。
    最近，华超已被香港舞蹈团特邀为客席编导，与该团艺术总监舒巧合作排练神幻题材的大型舞剧《日月恋》。他认为：生命的价值不在最后的亮相和定型姿态而在于创作的过程，因此，他十分乐意把过程中的感悟奉献给读者和观众。
