	According to a survey by the American Salomon Brothers company, the U.S. oil and gas companies will slightly increase their global exploration and production expenditures in 1989 compared to 1988.

	This major U.S. investment company stated in its annual survey report that in 1989, 118 medium and small-sized U.S. oil and gas companies will increase their exploration and production expenditures by 5.3 percent compared to last year, reaching $3.4 billion, while 20 large companies will reduce their expenditures in this area by 6.1 percent, decreasing to $12.9 billion.

	The report pointed out that there are two notable trends in the U.S. oil and gas industry at present. First, more exploration and production investments are being shifted towards natural gas, as it is generally believed that the potential for natural gas price increases is higher than that for oil prices. Second, some major oil companies may continue to use their exploration and production investments overseas.

	According to the survey, last year, 57 percent of large oil companies invested their exploration and production funds overseas, while this year, 73 percent of large oil companies will increase their overseas investments.

　　美石油天然气公司将增加国外投资
    新华社纽约电  据美国萨洛蒙兄弟公司的调查，美国石油天然气公司今年在全世界的勘探和生产开支将比一九八八年稍有增加。
    这家美国的主要投资公司在它的年度调查报告中说，一九八九年，有一百一十八家美国的中小型石油天然气公司用于勘探和生产方面的开支将比去年增加百分之五点三，达三十四亿美元，而二十家大公司在这方面的开支将减少百分之六点一，降至一百二十九亿美元。
    报告指出，现在在美国的石油天然气工业中有两种趋向值得注意。一是把更多的勘探和生产投资转向天然气，因为普遍认为，天然气价格上涨的潜力将高于石油价格。二是一些主要石油公司可能继续把它们的勘探和生产投资用在国外。
    据调查，去年，有百分之五十七的大石油公司把它们的勘探和生产投资用在国外，而今年，在大石油公司中将有百分之七十三的公司增加在国外的投资。
