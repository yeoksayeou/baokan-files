Qiao Shi, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Secretary of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, emphasized at the national discipline inspection work conference that concluded today that, during the rectification, rectification, and comprehensive deepening of reforms, strengthening party spirit and improving discipline awareness is a major task for the entire party.

Qiao Shi said that all levels of party organizations, especially the leading cadres and leading bodies at all levels, should set an example for party members and the people with a stronger party spirit and organizational discipline. At the same time, various effective methods and lively forms, including democratic evaluation of party members, evaluation of party and government leading cadres, and handling of cases of lawlessness and indiscipline, should be used to persistently carry out education. The discipline inspection commissions at all levels, as assistants and advisors to the party committees, certainly have an irresistible responsibility.

Qiao Shi, in his speech, required the discipline inspection commissions at all levels to adhere to the principle of strict party governance, seriously enforce party discipline, and resolutely correct the phenomena of "having orders but not executing them, having prohibitions but not stopping them, loose discipline, and even 'you have policies, I have countermeasures'" that exist in some regions and departments during the rectification and rectification. Maintain the authority of the Constitution, laws, and decisions and orders of the Party Central Committee and the State Council. For those party members who severely disrupt economic order and harm the interests of the people through embezzlement, bribery, extortion, abuse of power, dereliction of duty, and illegal trading, they must be severely punished to eliminate interference and obstacles for rectification and rectification and ensure the smooth progress of comprehensive deepening of reforms.

Qiao Shi said that strengthening discipline is not a constraint but an indispensable guarantee for democratic political construction and the development of a commodity economy.

Qiao Shi, when talking about the relationship between clean governance and party style construction, said that as long as one is a Communist Party member, one must be honest and upright. If one cannot do this, one has no right to be a Communist Party member. He said that the issue of clean governance is an important part of party style construction, but it is not the whole content of party style construction. Maintaining clean governance is not only a requirement for party and government organs and party cadres, but also a common requirement for all Communist Party members on all fronts and at all work posts.

Qiao Shi emphasized that it is necessary to speed up the handling of disciplinary cases. The leadership of the party committee should personally oversee the handling of major disciplinary cases, support the discipline inspection commission to remove obstacles, and enforce discipline impartially. For discipline inspection cadres who are subjected to harassment and retaliation for upholding principles, the party committee should clearly protect and support them. Leading comrades of the party committee should recuse themselves from party disciplinary cases in which they are involved and support the discipline inspection commission to handle matters according to party principles. For those who interfere with the discipline inspection commission's case handling by relying on their power, they should be criticized and educated lightly, and those who are serious should be given corresponding disciplinary sanctions according to the severity of the circumstances.

Qiao Shi required the discipline inspection organs and discipline inspection cadres to dare to fight against all illegal and indisciplined behaviors, dare to resist interference in case handling, withstand the wind of intercession, and not be afraid to offend people. They should be good at handling various contradictions in complex situations, be familiar with and master relevant policies and regulations, and improve the level of disciplinary enforcement and case handling. At the same time, they should increase the openness of case handling work, fully trust and rely on the party organizations at all levels and the broad masses of the people, and do a good job in case handling.

Qiao Shi finally emphasized that party committees at all levels should strengthen their leadership and support for discipline inspection work, and give full play to their functions and roles. He also required discipline inspection organs at all levels to further improve their own construction to meet the needs of the situation.

During the 6-day conference, the representatives also listened to the experience introductions of 19 comrades.

　　乔石在纪检工作会上强调全党的一件大事——     
    领导干部要增强党性提高纪律观念   
    党委要支持纪委排除阻力，秉公执纪，查处重大违纪案件
    本报北京１月２８日讯  新华社记者陈雁、本报记者陈维伟报道：中共中央政治局常委、中央纪委书记乔石在今天结束的全国纪检工作会议上强调，在治理、整顿和全面深化改革中，增强党性，提高纪律观念是全党的一件大事。
    乔石说，党的各级组织，首先是各级领导班子、领导干部，都应以更强的党性和组织纪律性作党员和人民群众的表率。同时，要用各种有效的方法，生动活泼的形式，包括民主评议党员、评议党政领导干部，处理违法乱纪案件的实例等等，坚持不懈地进行教育。各级纪委，作为党委的助手和参谋，当然有不可推卸的责任。
    乔石在讲话中要求各级纪委坚持从严治党的方针，严肃党的纪律，坚决纠正在某些地区和部门存在的有令不行、有禁不止、纪律松弛甚至在治理整顿中还存在的“你有政策，我有对策”的现象，维护国家宪法、法律和党中央、国务院决策和政令的权威性。对那些贪污受贿、敲诈勒索、弄权渎职、非法倒卖等严重破坏经济秩序、损害人民群众利益的党员，要严厉惩处，为治理整顿排除干扰和阻力，保证全面深化改革的顺利进行。
    乔石说，加强纪律，对于民主政治建设和商品经济的发展，决不是束缚，而是不可缺少的保证。
    乔石在谈到廉政工作与党风建设的关系时说，只要是共产党员，都必须做到廉洁奉公。如果做不到这一点，就没有资格当共产党员。他说，廉洁问题是党风建设的重要内容，但不是党风建设的全部内容。保持廉洁，不仅仅是对党政机关和党员干部的要求，而是对各条战线、各个工作岗位上的所有共产党员的共同要求。
    乔石强调，必须抓紧查处违纪案件，对重大违纪案件的查处，党委领导应亲自过问，支持纪委排除阻力，秉公执纪。对因坚持原则而受到刁难和打击报复的纪检干部，党委要旗帜鲜明地给予保护和支持。党委领导同志要回避与自己有牵连的党内违纪案件，支持纪委按党的原则办事。对凭借职权，干扰纪委办案的人，轻者批评教育，严重的视情节轻重给以相应的纪律处分。
    乔石要求纪检机关和纪检干部勇于同各种违法乱纪行为作斗争，敢于抵制干扰办案的行为，顶住说情风，不怕得罪人。要善于在复杂的情况下处理各种矛盾，熟悉和掌握有关政策规定，提高执纪办案水平。同时，要增加办案工作的开放程度，充分相信和依靠党的各级组织和广大人民群众，做好案件查处工作。
    乔石最后强调，各级党委要加强对纪检工作的领导和支持，充分发挥其职能和作用。他同时要求各级纪检机关要进一步搞好自身建设，以适应形势发展的需要。
    在６天的会议上，代表们还听取了１９位同志的经验介绍。
