Currently, Tai Chi has attracted the interest of many countries around the world. There are many participants in Japan, Singapore, and the Soviet Union has also begun practicing Tai Chi. Competitions are also frequent, and this year there will be a China-Japan Tai Chi competition. To adapt to this situation, the State Sports Commission's Martial Arts Academy has compiled new competition routines for Yang, Chen, Wu, and Sun styles of Tai Chi and has designated them as the official routines for this year's competitions.

The State Sports Commission's Martial Arts Academy has decided to start training coaches, athletes, and referees in three phases beginning in February. Through this training, the technical and theoretical levels of the trainees will be significantly improved, and the competitions will be more standardized.

The newly compiled competition routines for Yang, Chen, Wu, and Sun styles of Tai Chi both inherit traditional techniques and adapt to competitive requirements, with more beautiful and precise movements. Officials from the State Sports Commission's Martial Arts Academy believe that promoting these four styles of Tai Chi will help enhance physical health.
