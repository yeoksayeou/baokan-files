South Korea's three major opposition parties—Civic, Democratic, and Republican—held a meeting on January 24. The parties decided to actively promote exchanges of people and goods between North and South Korea. They also agreed to support South Korean youth participating in the 13th World Youth Festival to be held in Pyongyang and to form a unified sports team to participate in the 11th Asian Games in Beijing.

The 13th World Youth Festival is scheduled for July this year in Pyongyang, North Korea. North Korea has formally invited South Korean youth to participate, and the South Korean Federation of University Student Councils has expressed a clear willingness to attend the 13th World Youth Festival.
