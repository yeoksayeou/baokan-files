The "Geological Team with Major Contributions to Mineral Exploration" named by the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources—Team 402 of the Hunan Provincial Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources—last year discovered gold reserves totaling 9.35 tons in northeastern Hunan. Of this amount, 3.65 tons have been submitted as detailed reserves, and 5.7 tons as preliminary reserves. Additionally, they have discovered two new placer gold deposits. One of these has been controlled using sparse engineering methods over an area of 3 square kilometers, with gold content exceeding the national industrial standard. The deposit area is expected to expand to 10 square kilometers.
