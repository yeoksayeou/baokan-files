	Balancing Surplus and Shortage of Materials, Preventing Illegal Reselling
	Beijing Supply and Marketing Materials Exchange Welcomed by Enterprises

	Xinhua News Agency reports: The Beijing Supply and Marketing Materials Exchange, which specializes in non-plan materials, does not engage in illegal reselling. Instead, it focuses on helping enterprises balance surplus and shortage of materials, finding outlets for enterprises' surplus materials, and broadening sources for urgently needed materials. Through good service, it has created both social and economic benefits.

	The Beijing Supply and Marketing Materials Exchange is an officially approved non-plan materials trading enterprise in Beijing. Over the past two years, market staff have frequently visited production enterprises to purchase surplus and stagnant materials, helping enterprises turn "dead stock" into "live stock." Currently, this business accounts for nearly half of the market's total trading volume. The market also provides free venues and holds a materials exchange fair every Tuesday, allowing enterprises to meet directly and exchange surplus and shortage materials.

	This market adheres to the principle of service first, doing everything possible to help enterprises solve their problems. For some township enterprises from other provinces that have difficulty selling their products, the market takes on the task of selling their products, creating conditions for their products to enter the Beijing market. When enterprises urgently need materials, the market does its best to find sources. A Beijing joint-venture boiler factory urgently needed a type of stainless steel plate, which was not available in Beijing. The Supply and Marketing Materials Exchange immediately contacted suppliers in other provinces, and upon delivery, the materials were unloaded directly from the train and sent to the factory. Usually, when enterprises need small quantities of materials, a phone call is all it takes, and the market delivers the goods to their doorstep, earning the favor of enterprises.

    北京市供销物资交易市场是北京市正式批准的计划外物资经营企业。成立两年来，市场业务人员经常深入生产企业当中，收购积压呆滞物资，帮助企业把“死物”变成“活物”。目前，这项业务几乎占整个市场交易额的一半。市场还免费提供场地，每周二举办物资交易赶集会，让企业直接见面，相互调剂余缺物资。
    这个市场坚持服务第一的方针，想方设法为企业排忧解难。一些外地乡镇企业产品销路不畅，市场就给他们代销，为他们的产品打入首都市场创造条件。企业急需物资，他们尽其所能寻找货源。北京一家中外合资的锅炉厂急需一种不锈钢板，在北京买不到，供销物资交易市场立即与外地联系，到货后，卸下火车直接送货到工厂。平时，企业需要的小额物资，打一个电话，他们就送货上门，深受企业欢迎。
