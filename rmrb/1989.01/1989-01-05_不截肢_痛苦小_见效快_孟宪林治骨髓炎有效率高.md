No Amputation, Less Pain, Quick Results: Meng Xianlin's Highly Effective Treatment for Osteomyelitis

	The Beijing Shanhai County Shahe Osteomyelitis Specialty Hospital has used Dr. Meng Xianlin's ancestral secret formula for the past two years to treat 700 patients with acute and chronic osteomyelitis from 28 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government. The effective rate has reached 100%, and the cure rate is over 95%.

	For acute and chronic osteomyelitis, Western medicine usually resorts to amputation to control the condition. Meng Xianlin, the director of the Beijing Shanhai County Shahe Osteomyelitis Specialty Hospital, who is over 70 years old, has spent more than half of his life researching and practicing clinically. He uses ancestral secret formulas and folk remedies to create specialized treatments for osteomyelitis, such as "Jiulingshuao," "Jiulingshui," and "Zhenzhusan." By combining internal medication with external application, patients experience less pain and see quicker results. Meng Xianlin's treatment methods and medications for osteomyelitis have attracted attention from the medical community.
