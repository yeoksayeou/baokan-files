Qian Qichen Holds Press Conference in Paris
Discusses Sino-Vietnamese and Sino-Soviet Relations
Expresses Satisfaction with Visit to France

Paris, January 14 (Xinhua) - Qian Qichen, the Chinese Foreign Minister, concluded his successful visit to France and held a press conference for Chinese and foreign journalists this morning in Paris. He expressed his pleasure at being in Paris on the eve of the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution and the 25th anniversary of the establishment of Sino-French diplomatic relations. Qian met with President Mitterrand, Prime Minister Rocard, Speaker Fabius, and three ministers responsible for finance, foreign trade, and equipment. He also held talks with Foreign Minister Dumas on international and bilateral issues of mutual concern, and signed a memorandum of intent to establish one consulate general each in both countries. Qian said both sides were satisfied with the successful visit.

In response to a journalist's question about Sino-Vietnamese relations, Qian said the main obstacle is the Vietnamese military's invasion of Cambodia. He noted that once this issue is resolved, there is potential for improvement in Sino-Vietnamese relations. Qian reminded everyone that in March 1983, the Chinese government issued a statement declaring that as long as Vietnamese troops withdraw from Cambodia, there would be no difficulty in improving Sino-Vietnamese relations.

Regarding Sino-Soviet relations, Qian said they are improving. He emphasized that the relationship between China and the Soviet Union will not return to the alliance of the 1950s. China hopes to establish neighborly and friendly relations based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and to develop economic and trade exchanges.

When asked about the incident involving African students, Qian replied that it was an isolated incident between young people during a holiday, which has already subsided and will not affect Sino-African relations. He refuted some Western media reports, stating that China does not have racism, and most African students can get along well with Chinese students.

A journalist asked about Taiwan's "flexible diplomacy" towards Europe, to which Qian responded that China's policy of one China will not change. He said that any attempt by Taiwan to split is doomed to fail. Qian mentioned that the Taiwan issue was discussed with Dumas, who stated that France will not establish official relations with Taiwan. Qian believed France's stance is clear. He emphasized that both China and France are satisfied with the development of bilateral relations, and the prospects are good.

Qian Qichen and his delegation will depart Paris this afternoon for a visit to Romania.

　　钱其琛在巴黎举行记者招待会
    谈及中越中苏关系　对这次访法表示满意
    本报巴黎１月１４日电  记者张启华报道：钱其琛外长圆满结束了对法国的访问，今天上午在巴黎举行中外记者招待会。他向记者们说，他为能在法国大革命２００周年和中法建交２５周年前夕来到巴黎而感到高兴。钱外长会见了密特朗总统、罗卡尔总理、法比尤斯议长，以及负责财政、外贸、装备的三名部长，并同迪马外长就共同关心的国际和双边问题进行了会谈，签署了双方各增设一个总领事馆的意向书。钱外长说，中法双方都对这次成功的访问表示满意。
    钱外长在回答记者提出的有关中越关系问题时说，关于中越关系，主要障碍是越南军队侵略柬埔寨问题，只要这个问题解决了，中越关系是有可能改善的。钱外长提醒大家注意，１９８３年３月中国政府发表的一项声明就宣布，只要越南军队撤出柬埔寨，中越关系的改善是没有困难的。
    在谈到中苏关系时，钱外长说，中苏关系正在改善。中苏两国关系的发展不会恢复到５０年代那样的结盟关系。中国希望按照和平共处的五项原则，建立睦邻、友好关系，发展经济贸易往来。
    当记者问：中国对非洲学生的事件采取什么办法？钱外长回答说，这是两国年轻人在过节时发生的孤立事件，已趋向平息，它不会影响中国与非洲的关系。他针对一些西方报纸的报道指出，中国不存在什么种族主义，大部分非洲留学生都能与中国学生友好相处。
    有记者问道，台湾正在对欧洲实行“弹性外交”，中国怎么看待这个问题？钱外长说，我们奉行一个中国的政策是不会改变的。台湾有人想搞分裂这是行不通的。钱外长说中法外长谈到了台湾问题，迪马外长表示，法国不会跟台湾发生官方的关系。钱外长认为法国的立场是明确的。他强调说，中法对两国关系的发展是满意的，前景也是良好的。
    钱其琛外长一行今天下午离开巴黎飞往罗马尼亚访问。
