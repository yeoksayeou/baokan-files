	Wu Shaozu, the newly appointed director of the State Sports Commission, humorously proposed an innovative idea: "In the future, will interactions between people merely involve mutual transactions, mutual competition, or even mutual conflict? I think that sports exchanges might become a form of politics, a very important form of interpersonal relationships."

	Building New Interpersonal Relationships

	He made these remarks while discussing the functions of sports. He believes that sports have three levels of functions. The first level is physical fitness, the second level is mental strength, which includes cultivating willpower, emotions, perseverance, discipline, competitive spirit, and competitive awareness. The third level is group consciousness, which is about establishing a new type of interpersonal relationship.

	This new member of the "cabinet," who holds a graduate degree from a prestigious university, had only been in office for eight days when we interviewed him. However, the continuous flow of sports information from all directions was already pushing him to consider sports from a macro perspective as a complex and dynamic social phenomenon. From the beginning, he has tried to grasp the development of Chinese sports with a broad cultural vision.

	His open-minded approach seems to be related to his rich social experiences and extensive scientific and cultural background. Even during his time at Tsinghua University, Wu Shaozu demonstrated a strong sense of public service and organizational talent, being elected as the secretary-general and vice-chairman of the student union. In 1965, he was elected as the chairman of the All-China Student Federation. In the mid-1970s, he began a 13-year military career in the national defense science and technology system, serving as a staff officer, deputy section chief, deputy bureau chief, deputy director, and political commissar. He has led various joint operations, including the development of strategic weapons and missile nuclear weapons, which undoubtedly honed his leadership and organizational skills. Now, he will apply these abilities in the new field of sports work.

	The Beijing Asian Games Will Be a New Challenge

	"I am first facing the 622 days until the 11th Asian Games in Beijing." He took on his new role with a strong sense of responsibility and urgency. Although he advocates for the coordinated development of mass fitness and competitive sports and does not support "placing too much emphasis on gold medals," he still believes that we should strive to win more medals in the Asian Games. Counting the days, he feels the situation is serious because in the competition of comprehensive sports strength among Asian countries, China has not shown a clear advantage, and the Seoul Olympics also reflected many problems in China's sports management system and team quality that need to be addressed. Wu Shaozu said: "The 11th Asian Games will be a new challenge for us."

	Promoting Democracy and Encouraging Open Discussion

	A large-scale discussion on sports work has actually begun. The debate sparked by the reportage "Strong Country Dream" continues to this day. When talking about this phenomenon, Wu Shaozu emphasized the need to fully promote democracy, welcome everyone to think, and allow for different opinions. Such discussions are necessary for the continuous progress of sports work. Of course, discussions should follow certain democratic procedures, and actions should be disciplined. He said: "Many people come to talk to me, and I say, 'Sorry, I have to listen to the opposing views as well, because hearing both sides makes one clearer!'"

	Wu Shaozu is not unfamiliar with sports; he enjoys long-distance running and is skilled in shooting. During his university days, he obtained a national third-level athlete certificate and is still a good shooter. Last month, his shooting score was 96 rings for ten shots with a 100-meter rifle and 69 rings for seven shots with a 20-meter pistol. Dramatically, he also has experience leading sports work. He served as the chairman of the sports association of the Engineering Physics Department at Tsinghua University. Of course, over 30 years ago, he was only leading the sports work of over a hundred people in a department, but now he will be in charge of the sports affairs of a vast country with a population of ten billion.

### 体委主任伍绍祖论“政”

　　体委主任伍绍祖论“政”
    上任伊始的国家体育运动委员会主任伍绍祖，以幽默的口吻提出了一个颇有新意的见解：“将来人与人之间，难道只是互相作买卖，互相争夺，甚至互相打仗吗？我想，体育交往或者就是未来的一种政治，一种十分重要的人际关系。”
    　　　　建立新型的人际关系
    他是在侃侃而谈体育的功能时发出这样的议论的。他认为体育的功能有三个层次，第一层次是健身，第二层次是强心，包括加强意志、感情、毅力、纪律性、拚搏精神和竞争意识的培养，第三层次是群体意识，也就是建立一种新型的人际关系。
    这位具有高等学府研究生学历的新“内阁”成员在接受我们的采访时，受命不过八天，但从四面八方源源而来的体育信息，已经在催促他从宏观上考虑体育这个复杂而生动的社会现象。而他从一开始就力图用现代大文化观念，对中国体育的发展作一种高屋建瓴的把握。
    开阔的思路，看来与他丰富的社会生活经历与多方面的科学文化素养有关，还是在清华大学读书时，伍绍祖即表现出为公众服务的热忱与组织才能，被推选为校学生会秘书长、副主席，１９６５年又被选为全国学联主席。７０年代中期，他开始了在国防科技系统供职的１３年军旅生涯，历任参谋、副科长、副局长、副主任、政治委员等。他曾分工主持各方会战，研制战略武器和导弹核武器，这对他的领导与组织能力无疑是极好的锻炼。现在他的这种才干，要在体育工作这个新的领域里施展了。
    　　　　北京亚运会将是新的考验
    “我面临的首先是６２２天以后在北京举行的第十一届亚洲运动会。”他是带着强烈的事业心和紧迫感走马上任的。虽然，他赞成全民健身与竞技体育协调发展，而不赞成“把金牌看得太重”，但亚运会的奖牌还是应当争取多拿几块。屈指算日子，他感到形势严峻，因为在亚洲诸国体育综合实力的较量中，中国并未表现出明显的优势，而汉城奥运会又反映出中国在体育管理体制与队伍素质方面存在着不少亟待解决的问题。伍绍祖说：“第十一届亚运会对我们将是一次新的考验。”
    　　　　发扬民主　畅所欲言
    一场关于体育工作的大讨论实际上已经开始了。由报告文学《强国梦》引起的观点交锋延续到今天。在谈到这种现象时，伍绍祖强调要充分发扬民主，要欢迎大家想问题，要允许有不同的意见，这种讨论是体育工作不断进步所必需的。当然应该按一定的民主程序来讨论，行动还要有纪律。他说：“许多人来找我谈话，我都说，对不起，听了你讲的，我还要听听你的对立面的意见，兼听则明嘛！”
    伍绍祖对体育并不外行，他喜欢长跑，擅长射击，在大学时曾获得国家三级运动员证书，至今仍然是一名好射手，上个月他的打靶成绩，一百米步枪胸环靶十发子弹９６环。二十米手枪胸环靶七发子弹６９环，颇具戏剧性的是，对领导体育工作他也早有演练，他担任过清华大学工程物理系的体育协会主席，当然，３０多年前，他只是领导一个系里百余人的体育工作，现在却要掌管十亿人口的泱泱大国的体育事业了。
