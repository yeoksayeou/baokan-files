Hungary's Price and Wage and Welfare Reform to Be Carried Out Simultaneously

Implementing Free Prices and Raising Wages and Welfare

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, January 7th – Hungary is conducting price reforms while simultaneously implementing reforms in wages and social welfare.

Last year, 80% of Hungary's products were priced freely, and this year prices will be further liberalized. Most food items, transportation, and medicines, which were previously subsidized by the state, will have their subsidies either completely or partially removed, and free pricing will be implemented. Many commodity prices and fees will see significant increases.

Hungary's further liberalization of prices is an important step towards a market economy. However, Hungary has paid attention to synchronizing price reforms with wage and welfare reforms, aiming to avoid placing an unbearable burden on consumers.

In terms of wage reforms, the measures to be taken this year include: raising the minimum wage standard, increasing the minimum wage by more than 23%, linking wage growth closely with production results, the higher the production results, the higher the wage growth rate; if the foreign share in a joint venture exceeds 20% of the enterprise's fund or exceeds 50 million forints, the wage growth rate for these enterprises will not be restricted.

Additionally, the government has allocated 41 billion forints to specifically raise the wages of educators, cultural workers, and healthcare professionals, whose wages have been relatively low for many years.

Hungary is also taking measures to improve social welfare. Starting from this year, pensions and family hardship allowances have been increased, ensuring that this group of people with lower incomes have living security. According to Hungarian government spokesperson Marosan, these allowances can offset 3/4 of the increased expenses for this group due to price hikes. At the same time, some subsidy methods have been changed. This year, subsidies for medicine prices will be canceled, and a patient medication subsidy system will be implemented. This subsidy method is more reasonable than medicine price subsidies, as it can provide patients with more subsidies and also promote the economical use of medicines.

Due to the simultaneous implementation of price reforms and wage and welfare reforms, Hungary has not seen phenomena such as panic buying before the price hikes, and the overall society remains basically stable.

### 匈物价与工资福利改革同步进行　实行自由价格　提高工资福利

　　匈物价与工资福利改革同步进行
  　实行自由价格　提高工资福利
    新华社布达佩斯１月７日电  （记者邹国昌）匈牙利在进行物价改革的同时，实行工资和社会福利的改革。
    去年，匈牙利８０％的产品属于自由价格，今年价格又进一步放开。原来由国家补贴的大部分食品、交通和药材，今年将全部或部分取消价格补贴，实行自由价格。许多商品价格和费用将大幅度上涨。
    匈牙利实行物价的进一步放开是向市场经济发展的重要步骤，但匈牙利注意将物价改革与工资、福利改革同步进行，力求不给消费者造成无力承受的负担。
    在工资改革方面，今年将采取的措施是：提高最低工资标准，将最低工资增加２３％以上，使工资的增长与生产成果的增长紧密挂钩，生产成果越大，工资增长率越高；如果合资企业中的外国股份占企业基金的２０％以上或超过５００万福林，对这些企业的工资增长率不予限制。
    另外，政府还拨款４１亿福林，专门用于提高多年偏低的教育、文化和卫生战线职工的工资。
    匈牙利还采取措施，提高社会福利。从今年１月起提高了退休金和家庭困难补贴，使这部分收入不高的人得到生活保障。据匈牙利政府发言人马罗山说，这些补贴将可抵消这部分人因物价上涨而增加支出的３／４。同时，还改变了一些补贴办法。今年将取消对药品的价格补贴，实行病人购药补贴制度。这种补贴办法较之药品价格补贴更为合理，既可使病人获得更多的补贴，又可起到节约使用药品的作用。
    由于物价改革和工资、福利改革同步进行，匈牙利在物价上涨前没有出现抢购商品等现象，整个社会基本安定。
