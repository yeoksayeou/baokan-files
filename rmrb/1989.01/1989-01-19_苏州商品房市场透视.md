In the ancient city of Suzhou in Jiangnan, millions of residents who have long lived in public housing are attracted by the spacious, bright, and well-equipped commercial housing units.

Suzhou has already had three large-scale sales of commercial housing. A worker from a market once waited eagerly outside the door of the real estate trading market on its opening day, carrying tens of thousands of yuan in cash, and happily bought two medium-sized units in Yongning New Village.

Selling commercial housing directs workers' purchasing power towards buying homes, which not only reduces market pressure but also improves residents' living conditions. This is undoubtedly a beneficial strategy for both the country and the people. However, upon reviewing the situations that arose during these three commercial housing transactions, there is much to ponder.

The first consideration: What is the general consumer's affordability?

Promoting the commercialization of housing first requires considering whether the price is acceptable to the majority and whether it matches the public's actual purchasing power. What is the current affordability of the general consumer? Analyzing the three sales in Suzhou can provide the answer. The first time, the Municipal Housing Construction Office offered 84 public housing units, averaging a few hundred yuan per square meter. The news spread quickly, and they were snapped up in an instant. It was originally thought that these houses might be bought by those with overseas economic sources or individual entrepreneurs, but in reality, these groups accounted for only 7% of the purchases, while 93% of the houses were bought by ordinary workers, grassroots cadres, and teachers. The second time, Suzhou Chemical Factory offered 50 commercial housing units at a few hundred yuan per square meter to its employees. As soon as the plan was announced, 176 households applied, and in the end, the "priority method" had to be adopted to resolve the supply-demand contradiction. The third time, the real estate trading market opened, with various units providing 164 commercial housing units, each costing over a thousand yuan per square meter. The result was that many people inquired, but few transactions were completed; only 49 units were sold in two to three months, and most of these were bought by units, with only 5 units purchased by individuals. The public said, "Such a high price, we can't afford it."

This shows that currently, commercial housing priced at a few hundred yuan per square meter is still affordable for citizens. According to surveys by relevant departments, if the price is appropriate, a 50-square-meter apartment priced around 20,000 yuan, some consumers have the ability to purchase commercial housing.

The second consideration: Why is the popular ready-to-move-in housing in short supply?

To make commercial housing attractive, in addition to a reasonable price, buyers should be able to move in immediately after payment. Currently, various housing development companies in Suzhou provide two types of commercial housing for the market: ready-to-move-in housing, where payment is made and the house is handed over immediately; and future delivery housing, where a deposit is paid but the house is only available after a year or more. From Suzhou's several commercial housing sales, ready-to-move-in housing, even if the location, floor, and lighting conditions are not ideal, remains popular, while future delivery housing, despite better location, floor, and structure, has few inquiries. This situation arises because, on one hand, most buyers are facing housing difficulties and need immediate solutions; on the other hand, buying future delivery housing raises concerns about price increases at the time of settlement.

However, the popular ready-to-move-in housing currently on the market is not only in short supply but also of lower quality, while future delivery housing is the opposite. Why is this? The main reason is that the units providing housing for the market prefer "wholesale" over "retail," meaning they prefer to sell in batches to units rather than one by one to individuals. Apart from policy reasons, the main issue is that units buying housing can better arrange for land acquisition labor.

The third consideration: Can after-sales services keep up?

After workers purchase housing, a concern is: Will there be guarantees for future maintenance and management? At the trading fair, many people inquired about this. As consumers, having such concerns is justified. Houses, like high-end products such as color TVs and refrigerators, can sometimes have "malfunctions," whether it's blocked pipes or leaking roofs. Some residents can find solutions themselves; others may lack the means. Especially in high-rise buildings, some issues cannot be handled by a single household. Therefore, if a comprehensive set of after-sales management and maintenance services is not in place, consumers' concerns will not be alleviated.

The sale of commercial housing has just begun in many places, and some functional departments are accustomed to managing public housing but are unfamiliar with managing commercial housing. This issue needs a quick solution. Currently, various places are exploring solutions, with some proposing a one to two-year warranty after the sale, and others prioritizing comprehensive service work in the sold residential areas. Many experts believe that these practices are worth promoting.

　　苏州商品房市场透视
    徐仁官
    在江南古城苏州市，千万个长期住在公房里的居民，被那一幢幢宽敞明亮、设施齐全的商品房吸引着。
    苏州市已有３次成批出售商品房。有一菜场职工，在市房地产交易市场开业那天一大早，怀揣数万元现金等候开门，喜孜孜地买了永宁新村两个中套房子。
    出售商品房，把职工的购买力引导到买房上来，既可减轻市场的压力，又改善了居民的居住条件，这无疑是利国利民的良策。但是，纵观这３次商品房交易中出现的情况，留给人的思考也不少。
    思考之一：一般消费者的承受能力有多大？
    推行住房商品化，首先要考虑到其价格要为大多数人所接受，并与市民的实际购买能力相适应。当前一般消费者的承受能力有多大？分析苏州市３次出售情况，就不难找到答案。第一次，市住宅建设处推出的８４套公房，平均每平方米不过几百元，消息一传出，就被一抢而空。原以为这些房子可能被有海外经济来源或个体户购买，实际上这几种对象购房比例只占７％，而９３％的房子是被普通工人、基层干部和教师买去的。第二次，苏州化工厂向职工出售每平方米几百元的商品房５０套，方案一公布，提出申请的职工就有１７６户，最后不得已采取了“优先法”，才解决了供与求的矛盾。第三次，房地产交易市场开业，各单位提供１６４套商品房，每平方米上千元，结果是问的人多，成交的少，二三个月只卖出４９套，而其中大多数是被单位买去的，属于个人购买的只有５套。群众说：“这样高的价格，我们吃不消。”
    这说明，目前市场上几百元一平方米的商品房，市民在经济上还是能够承受的。据有关部门抽样调查，如果房价合适，一套５０平方米的住房，售价在２万元左右，有些消费者是有能力购买商品房的。
    思考之二：抢手的现货为何短缺？
    要使商品房具有吸引力，除了价格适中外，还要让购房者出了钱就能住上房子。目前，苏州市各房屋开发公司为交易市场提供的商品房有两种：一种是现货，就是一手交钱，一手拿房子；二是期货，即付定金后要等一年半载才能拿到房子。从苏州市几次商品房出售中，现货即使地段、层次、采光等条件不那么好，仍是抢手货，而期货尽管地段、层次、结构都较好，问津者却寥寥无几。出现这种情况，一方面购房者大都是住房困难户，买房以解燃眉之急；另一方面买期货，担心到交付结算时涨价。
    然而，现在市场上抢手的现货，不仅数量少，而且层次差，而期货却正好相反。这是为什么？主要是为市场提供房源的单位，喜欢“批发”，不愿“零售”，也就是喜欢成批售给单位，不愿一套一套卖给个人。这除了政策上的原因外，主要是单位买房好安排征地劳动力。
    思考之三：售后配套服务能否跟上？
    职工个人购房后，担心的一个问题：今后维修管理有无保证？在交易会上，对此打听问讯的人很多。作为消费者有这种担心并非没有道理。房子犹如彩电、冰箱等高档商品一样，有时也会发生“故障”，不是管道不通，就是屋顶漏水。有的住户自己可以想办法解决；有的住户就心有余而力不足。特别是高层建筑，有些事不是一家一户所能办得到的。因此，如果没有一整套售后管理和维修服务的措施跟上去，消费者的后顾之忧就解除不了。
    商品房的出售在许多地方刚刚开始，一些职能部门习惯于对公房的管理，而对商品房的管理还很陌生。对这个问题，要尽快拿出对策才是。现在全国各地都在探索，有些地方提出卖房后保修一二年，也有些地方提出优先搞好出售住宅楼区的综合服务工作，等等。许多行家认为，这些做法值得推广。
