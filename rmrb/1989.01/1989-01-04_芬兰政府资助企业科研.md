The Finnish government will increase its support for research and development in various economic sectors by 43.6% during the period from 1989 to 1994, according to a five-year plan recently released by the Ministry of Trade and Industry. The budget for promoting foreign trade will also see a significant increase. This indicates that the Finnish government will prioritize supporting enterprises' research and product development to meet the needs of Western European integration and enterprise internationalization.

The five-year plan emphasizes that Western European integration requires Finland to adjust its domestic product technology standards accordingly and further promote the internationalization of enterprises. To this end, the government aims to increase the proportion of public sector funding for enterprise research expenses from the current 7% to 10% over the next few years.

The Ministry of Trade and Industry pointed out in the plan that Finland needs to strengthen its exports to Western industrialized countries while improving industrial activities in other rapidly growing market regions, particularly in the United States, Japan, and China.

Currently, the Ministry of Trade and Industry has industrial secretaries stationed in major product export countries in Western Europe, North America, and Asia. These secretaries are primarily responsible for gathering information on economic development, market trends, and product sales in their respective countries and regions, and providing various consulting services to Finnish industrial enterprises.

　　芬兰政府资助企业科研
    新华社赫尔辛基电  据芬兰贸易和工业部最近公布的５年计划，在１９８９至１９９４年期间，政府对各经济部门科研活动的资助将增加４３．６％，用于促进对外贸易的费用也将大幅度增加。这表明芬兰政府将重点支持企业的研究和产品开发工作，以便适应西欧一体化和企业国际化的需要。
    ５年计划强调，西欧一体化要求芬兰国内产品技术标准作出相应的调整，并进一步促进企业的国际化进程。为此，政府谋求在今后几年内，公共部门对企业研究费用的资助比例从目前的７％增加到１０％。
    贸易和工业部在计划中指出，芬兰既要加强对西方工业国的出口，又要改善工业在其它一些日益增长的市场地区的活动条件，特别是发展在美国、日本和中国的工业秘书服务工作。
    目前，芬兰贸易和工业部在西欧、北美和亚洲等地区的各主要产品销售国都派有工业秘书，他们主要负责搜集有关国家和地区的经济发展、市场动态和产品销售等方面的情况，并为芬兰工业企业提供各种咨询服务。
