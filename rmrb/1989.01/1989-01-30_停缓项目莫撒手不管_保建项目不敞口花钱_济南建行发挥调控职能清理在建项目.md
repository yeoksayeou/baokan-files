The Jinan branch of the Construction Bank of China has been actively leveraging its regulatory role to manage ongoing construction projects. For projects that have been stopped or delayed, the bank has halted loans but has not abandoned them, instead helping with follow-up work to minimize losses. For projects that are approved to continue, the bank provides funding but ensures it is used wisely, supervising the construction units to use the funds rationally and save costs. As of now, none of the bank's loaned projects that have been stopped or delayed have resulted in major losses, and the projects that have resumed construction have saved over 100 million yuan in investment.

Since the start of the project cleanup work, the Jinan branch of the Construction Bank of China established an office for managing the follow-up work of the cleanup projects, consisting of bank leaders and relevant department staff. Since September of last year, they have sent out over 20 work teams to the construction sites to understand the progress of the work, assess the potential for stopping or delaying projects, determine reasonable stopping points, and work with the construction and project units to develop remedial measures. They also organized short-term training for the financial staff of these units to handle follow-up financial matters.

For key projects approved to continue, the bank has focused on exercising its supervisory role to manage state funds effectively. For the Jinan North Suburb Thermal Power Plant's dedicated railway line, the original budget was 3.3 million yuan. To realistically determine the funding for this project, the bank formed a budget review team that went to the construction site to carefully review the specific engineering quotas for each project, proposing over 30 rationalization suggestions, and reducing the budget investment by over 580,000 yuan.

　　停缓项目莫撒手不管　保建项目不敞口花钱    
    济南建行发挥调控职能清理在建项目
    本报讯  山东省济南市建设银行努力发挥调控职能作用，对停缓建项目停贷但不大撒手，积极帮助做好善后工作，尽量减少损失；对保建项目投资但不大敞口，合理发放资金，监督基建单位合理使用资金，尽量节约开支。截至目前，该行贷款的停缓建项目无一造成重大损失，续建项目节约投资百余万元。
    清理在建项目工作开始后，济南市建设银行成立了由行领导和有关处、室业务人员参加的清理项目善后工作办公室。去年９月份以来，他们先后派出２０多个工作组，到建设项目施工现场了解施工进度，对可能停缓建的工程进行排队摸底，确定合理的停工部位，并同建设、施工单位共同研究制订补救措施，组织这些单位的财务人员进行善后财务处理的短期培训。
    对批准保建的重点项目，该行注意发挥监督职能，为国家管好资金。济南北郊热电厂铁路专用线原预算用款３３０万元。为实事求是确定该项目用款额度，该行组成预算审核小组，深入施工现场仔细审定每个项目具体工程定额，提出合理化建议３０余条，核减预算投资５８万余元。
