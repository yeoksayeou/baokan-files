A notorious thief known as the "safe-cracking expert," the unemployed youth Bi Baofang, was executed on January 14 in Jinan.

Bi Baofang committed 16 burglaries between December 1987 and May 1988. He targeted the finance departments and safes of 10 enterprises and institutions in Jinan's Huaiyin District, Wujiapu Town, and Zibo City, Dezhou City. He broke into 10 safes, picked 190 locks on doors, drawers, and cabinets, and stole a total of 7,778 yuan in cash, 4,000 yuan in bank savings bonds, 108,000 yuan in special project interest-bearing bonds, and 2,128 jin in grain coupons. Additionally, he stole a motorcycle, watches, calculators, and other items worth 6,600 yuan. In one instance, Bi Baofang collaborated with Zhou Jun to steal a motorcycle worth 3,678 yuan. Most of the stolen money was squandered on gambling. During his detention, Bi Baofang conspired with another inmate to escape by picking the lock on their cell but was captured.

Today, the Jinan Intermediate People's Court held a sentencing hearing and ruled: Bi Baofang is guilty of theft and was sentenced to death, with deprivation of political rights for life; for the attempted escape, he was sentenced to two years in prison. The court decided to carry out the death sentence and deprive him of political rights for life.

After the sentencing hearing, the criminal Bi Baofang was escorted to the execution ground and shot.
