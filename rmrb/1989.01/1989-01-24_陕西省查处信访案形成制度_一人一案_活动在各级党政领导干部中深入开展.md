    Shaanxi Province Establishes System for Handling Petitions
    "One Person, One Case" Activity Deeply Implemented Among Party and Government Leaders at All Levels

    XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, Xi'an, January 23rd — "In the national petition ranks, Shaanxi is relatively ahead. The province's implementation of the activity for township-level and above party and government leaders to handle petition cases has been effective, and many people no longer bypass levels to petition." This is the overall evaluation of the work by the responsible comrades of the Information Office of the Central Committee and the State Council during their recent inspection of Shaanxi.

    Petition work is the link and bridge between the Party and government and the people. Since July 1986, the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government have advocated: "In the entire province, township-level and above party and government leaders should personally handle one or two influential petition cases in their respective areas each year." According to statistics, by the end of last year, 24,217 township-level and above party and government leaders in the province had cumulatively handled 72,784 petition cases, averaging three cases per person, basically meeting the requirements. Among these petition cases, economic-related cases accounted for approximately 30%, recovering economic losses of over 12 million yuan.

    Shaanxi's petition work is relatively good, mainly because various levels of leadership pay attention to it and personally participate. In establishing petition offices, allocating personnel, and solving funding issues, the provincial party committee, the standing committee of the provincial people's congress, and the provincial government leadership have provided considerable support, ensuring that the petition work in the entire province has a reliable backing. The Weinan region, in organizing party and government leaders to handle petition cases, implements a system of assigning cases, leaders, measures, and case closure times, and has established a set of registration, notification, follow-up, reporting, and case closure evaluation systems. The case closure rate for petition cases registered by the central and provincial authorities has reached 100%.

    In Feng County, where the "One Person, One Case" activity has been well implemented, the number of petitions and visits was previously high, and there were many instances of bypassing levels to petition. The county party secretary and county magistrate directly handle major petition cases. Under their leadership, 124 township-level and above leaders in the county have collectively handled 468 influential petition cases, significantly reducing the number of bypassing-level and collective petitions, and the county has been recognized as an advanced unit for petition work in the province.

    Due to the attention of leaders at all levels, the implementation of the petition work responsibility system and target management, and the resolution of a large number of problems at the grassroots level, it has played an active role in promoting the maintenance of a stable and united political situation. Now, the "One Person, One Case" activity is being deeply implemented among party and government leaders at all levels in Shaanxi and has become a system.

　　陕西省查处信访案形成制度    
    “一人一案”活动在各级党政领导干部中深入开展
    本报西安１月２３日电  记者景险峰报道：“在全国信访行列里，陕西是走在比较前面的。全省推行乡以上领导干部查办信访案件活动卓有成效，许多群众不再越级上访”。这是中办、国办信访局负责同志最近在陕西考察工作时，对该省信访工作总的评价。
    信访工作是联系党和政府与人民群众的纽带和桥梁，１９８６年７月以来，陕西省委、省政府倡导：“在全省乡以上党政领导干部中，开展一人一年亲自动手查处一、两件在当地有影响的信访案件的活动”。据统计，截至去年年底，全省乡以上党政领导干部有２４２１７人累计查办信访案件７２７８４件，人均查办了３件，基本达到了要求。这些信访案件中，经济类案件约占３０％，挽回经济损失１２００多万元。
    陕西的信访工作做得比较好，关键在于各级领导重视，并亲自参与。在设立信访机构，配备编制和人员，解决经费等方面，省委、省人大常委会、省政府领导都给予较多支持，全省信访工作有了可靠后盾。渭南地区在组织党政领导干部查办信访案件中，实行定案子、定领导、定措施、定结案时间，并建立了一套登记、通知、催办、回报、结案等考核制度，对中央和省上立案要结果的信访案件结案率达到１００％。
    “一人一案”活动开展得好的凤县，过去信访、上访量大，越级上访也多。县委书记、县长对重大信访案件直接查办。在他们的带动下，全县乡以上１２４名领导干部共查办有影响的信访案件４６８件，越级上访的和集体上访的大幅度减少，被评为全省信访工作先进集体。
    由于各级领导重视，普遍实行了信访工作责任制和目标管理，把大量问题解决、消化在基层，对维护安定团结的政治局面起到了积极的推动作用。现在，“一人一案”活动在陕西各级党政领导干部中正在深入开展，并已形成制度。
