The water-saving cultivation method, recently approved by Sichuan Province, has shown that rice can be grown in dry conditions with yields comparable to those achieved with irrigation. This method does not require additional labor and can save half the amount of irrigation water per acre. The promotion of this method is expected to increase the proportion of fine grains and improve farmers' income from grain production.

On average, Sichuan Province has over 5 million acres of paddy fields that cannot be used for rice cultivation due to drought each year, and these fields can only be used to grow crops like corn that are suitable for dry conditions. Since 1977, the Sichuan Provincial Water Resources and Electric Power Research Institute, in collaboration with relevant departments in Neijiang City and Zizhong County, formed a research team to conduct dryland rice cultivation experiments in four townships in Zizhong County. The experiments showed that maintaining the relative humidity of the top 40 centimeters of soil between 65% and 90% can meet the water requirements for dryland rice cultivation. The experiments demonstrated that by quickly planting rice after harvesting wheat and ensuring frequent, light irrigation along with timely weeding and tilling, effective water conservation can be achieved. This method can save over 200 cubic meters of water per acre, reducing irrigation water usage by 50%. Locals refer to this cultivation method as the "water-saving cultivation method."

Sichuan Province has decided to promote this method across the entire province in 1989.

　　“保水耕作法”将在四川全省推广
    据新华社成都１月１５日电  （记者李灿）四川省日前通过鉴定的一项农业科研成果——“保水耕作法”，能使水稻旱作产量达到水作产量，不增加用工，每亩可节约一半灌溉用水，这项成果推广后将提高细粮比例和农民种粮收入。
    四川省平均每年因干旱而不能种水稻的水田达５００多万亩，只能改种玉米等旱地作物。四川省水利电力研究所从１９７７年起，与内江市、资中县有关部门联合组成课题组，在资中县的４个乡进行水稻旱作试验。据测定，如能使４０厘米厚的土壤相对湿度维持在６５％至９０％，即可满足旱作水稻对水分的需要。试验表明，只要在收完小麦作物后抓紧时间抢墒种植；坚持小水勤灌，及时中耕除草，就能做到有效保水。这样做每亩可节水２００立方米以上，节约５０％的灌溉用电。当地人把这种种植方法称为“保水耕作法”。
    四川省决定１９８９年在全省推广。
