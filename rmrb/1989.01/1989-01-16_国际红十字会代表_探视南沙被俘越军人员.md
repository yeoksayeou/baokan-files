Representatives of the International Red Cross Visit Captured Vietnamese Soldiers in the South China Sea

New China News Agency, Zhanjiang, January 15 - Representatives from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in East Asia, including Mr. Olivier, Dr. Michel Huber, and translator Pastor Bairenou, visited the temporary detention facility for foreign military personnel in Zhanjiang from January 11 to 13. They inspected the conditions of 9 Vietnamese soldiers captured during the March 14 conflict in the South China Sea. The representatives expressed satisfaction with the medical care and living conditions provided to the captured soldiers and thanked the Chinese side for their cooperation and facilitation.

The International Committee of the Red Cross is an international humanitarian organization headquartered in Geneva. Over three days, Mr. Olivier and his team conducted a thorough inspection, listened to the facility's management introduce the situation of the captured soldiers, and visited the soldiers' dormitories, dining hall, medical room, and recreational facilities. They also inquired about the treatment and nutrition of the injured soldiers. Mr. Olivier stated, "The physical condition of the captured soldiers is good, and their living conditions, including accommodation, hygiene, and clothing, are satisfactory." Dr. Michel Huber commented, "The Chinese military doctors have done their utmost, and the captured soldiers have received timely and appropriate treatment, in accordance with the Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War."

The 9 captured Vietnamese soldiers were rescued by Chinese naval soldiers after falling into the sea during the battle at Chuangua Reef in the South China Sea on March 14, 1988. At the time, they were barely alive. After receiving medical treatment and care from the Chinese side, they quickly recovered their health. The staff at the temporary detention facility adhere to international humanitarian principles, ensuring that the captured soldiers are well-fed and clothed. They also organize various cultural and sports activities, and arrange for them to visit the city, shops, and scenic spots. On Vietnamese traditional festivals, the Chinese side provides conditions for the captured soldiers to organize festive activities. Currently, the 9 captured soldiers have an average weight gain of 4 kilograms since their arrival.

The captured Vietnamese soldiers have also sent letters to their families back home through the International Red Cross.

    探视南沙被俘越军人员
    新华社湛江１月１５日电  国际红十字委员会驻东亚地区代表奥利维尔先生和米歇尔·胡伯医生、帕斯特·白海努翻译一行３人，于１月１１日至１３日在我人民解放军海军湛江外籍军人临时收容所，探视了南沙“３·１４”冲突中被我海军在海上救俘的９名越军人员。他们对中国方面给越俘人员提供的医疗和生活条件表示满意，对我方的积极合作和提供的工作方便表示感谢。
    国际红十字委员会是国际人道主义组织，总部设在日内瓦。奥利维尔先生及其随员通过３天深入细致的探视，听取了临时收容所负责人介绍越俘的有关情况，察看了越俘的宿舍、食堂、医疗室和文娱活动场所，询问了越俘伤员的治疗和伙食营养情况。奥利维尔先生说：“被俘人员身体状况良好，住宿、卫生、被服和生活条件良好。”米歇尔·胡伯医生说：“中国军队的医生尽了最大努力，被俘伤员得到了及时妥善治疗，符合日内瓦战俘待遇公约的规定。”
    ９名被俘越军人员是去年３月１４日在我南沙群岛赤瓜礁海战中落海，后被我海军水兵救俘，当时都已奄奄一息，经我方人员积极医治照料后，很快恢复健康。我临时收容所工作人员实行国际人道主义，不仅让越军被俘人员吃饱穿暖，而且组织他们参加各种文体活动，参观游览市容、商店、风景区。逢越南民族传统节日，我方还提供条件，允许越军被俘人员组织节日活动。现在９名被俘越军人员平均体重比刚来时增长了４公斤。
    被俘越军人员还通过国际红十字会向他们本国亲属发了家信。
