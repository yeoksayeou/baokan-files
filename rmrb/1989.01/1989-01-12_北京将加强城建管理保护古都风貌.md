Beijing will further accelerate the drafting and management of urban planning this year, strictly rectify illegal constructions, and better combine new constructions with the protection of the ancient capital's appearance.

The Beijing Urban Construction Work Conference, which concluded today, decided that Beijing will, on one hand, reasonably adjust and supplement the overall planning of the city, and expedite the drafting of specialized plans such as the urban water supply system and county city plans. On the other hand, it will resolutely adhere to construction regulations and plans. Currently, Beijing has begun a comprehensive inspection of construction in cultural relic protection areas and scenic areas.
