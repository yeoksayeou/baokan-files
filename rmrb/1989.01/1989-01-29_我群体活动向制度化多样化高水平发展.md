Our mass sports activities are developing towards institutionalization, diversification, and high levels. According to a reporter from Xinhua News Agency in Harbin, it was learned from the recently concluded National Mass Sports Work Conference held here that in the 10 years of reform and opening up, China's mass sports activities have presented a new situation with a large number of participants, strong sustainability, associations forming networks, and continuously improving levels.

Many large-scale mass sports activities with a large number of participants have been institutionalized. For example, the "Million Youth on Ice and Snow" activity organized by Heilongjiang Province is in its 10th year this year; the national "Million Workers Winter Long-Distance Running" activity has 20,000 grassroots units and 10 million workers participating. In addition, China has also held large-scale events such as the "Ten-Thousand-Person Marathon" and the "Ten-Thousand-Chess-Players Grand Prix." Many festivals have become fixed dates for mass sports activities, such as the "March 8th Health Cup Women's Sports Communication Competition," the "May 1st Long-Distance Run," the "September 9th Mountain Climbing," and so on.

Mass sports activities in various industries have broken through the "vertical" and developed "horizontally." Currently, there are 12 industry sports associations nationwide, and some departments have established preparatory committees to organize sports activities in their respective industries. The National Farmers' Sports Association, the National Senior Citizens' Sports Association, and the National Disabled Persons' Sports Association have all organized colorful sports activities. Notably, the organizations of these associations have extended to grassroots counties and cities, and some have developed to the township level. There are more than 3,000 various sports associations at the grassroots level in Shandong Province, forming a network of mass sports activities. The popularization of mass sports activities has promoted the construction of grassroots sports facilities. The number of counties and cities with "two fields, one pool, and one room" (track field, illuminated stadium, swimming pool, training room) has increased from 11 in 1982 to nearly 200 now.

The level of mass sports activities is continuously improving. In the 1986 Third National Middle School Games, 394 participants broke 56 middle school games records; in the 1988 Third National University Games, 274 participants and 27 teams broke 90 university games records 664 times; China's disabled athletes won 17 gold medals, 17 silver medals, and 10 bronze medals at the 8th World Disabled Olympics, breaking 9 world records 11 times. The Chinese Railway Sports Association was awarded the Outstanding Contribution to Sports Award by UNESCO last year, becoming an advanced organization in group work worldwide.

Delegates attending the National Mass Sports Work Conference believe that the achievements of China's mass sports work are inseparable from the Party's reform and opening-up policy. However, it should be noted that in some departments, there is still a tendency to prioritize medals over mass activities, which is an obstacle to the deep development of mass sports activities. To change this tendency, it is necessary to improve awareness, starting with improving the awareness of leading comrades regarding group work.

### 我群体活动向制度化多样化高水平发展

　　我群体活动向制度化多样化高水平发展
    新华社哈尔滨电（记者徐江善、实习生李春雷）记者从最近在这里结束的全国群众体育工作会议上获悉：改革开放的１０年，已使我国群众体育活动出现了人数众多、持久性强、协会成网、水平不断提高的新局面。
    不少参加人数众多的大型群众体育活动已经制度化。如黑龙江省开展的“百万青少年上冰雪”活动，今年已经是第１０个年头；全国的“百万职工冬季长跑”活动，有２万多个基层单位１０００多万职工参加。此外，我国还举办了“万人马拉松”、“万名棋手大奖赛”等群体大赛。许多节日已经成为开展群体活动的固定日期，如“三八”健康杯妇女体育活动通讯赛、“‘五一’长跑”、“‘九九’登山”等等。
    各行各业的群众体育活动已突破了“纵向”、向“横向”发展。目前全国已成立了１２个行业体协，还有些部门已建立了筹备组，组织本行业的群体活动。全国农民体协、全国老年人体协、全国伤残人体协等都开展了丰富多彩的体育活动。值得注意的是，各协会的组织已延伸到基层县市，有的发展到乡镇。山东省基层的各种体协已达３０００多个，形成了群众体育活动网络。群众体育活动的普及，促进了基层体育场地的建设。拥有“两场、一池、一房”（田径场、灯光球场、游泳池、训练房）的县市，已由１９８２年的１１个发展到目前近２００个。
    群众体育活动水平不断提高。在１９８６年第三届全国中学生运动会上，有３９４人次打破５６项中学生运动会纪录；１９８８年的第三届全国大学生运动会有２７４人、２７个队６６４次打破９０项大学生运动会纪录；我国伤残人在第八届世界伤残人奥运会上，获１７枚金牌、１７枚银牌和１０枚铜牌，１１人次打破９项世界纪录。中国火车头体协去年被联合国教科文组织授予体育事业突出贡献奖，成为世界上群体工作先进组织。
    参加全国群众体育工作会议的同志认为，我国群众体育工作取得的成绩是与党的改革开放政策分不开的。但应看到，在一些部门中，还存在着重金牌、轻群体活动的倾向，这是影响群众体育活动深入发展的障碍。要改变这种倾向，必须提高认识，首先是提高领导同志对群体工作的认识。
