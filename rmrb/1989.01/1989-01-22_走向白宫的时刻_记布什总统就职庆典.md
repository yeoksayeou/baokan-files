The Moment Toward the White House – Recording Bush's Presidential Inauguration Ceremony
By Jǐng Xiànfǎ, Correspondent

At 12:04 PM on January 20, 1989, Bush placed his hand on the Bible that every U.S. president has touched, swearing in as the 41st President of the United States.

This is a particularly memorable moment: 152 years ago, Bush was the first person to be elected president directly from the position of vice president; from the day George Washington took the oath of office to today, it has been exactly 200 years!

At around 11 AM, the "American Number One" Lincoln limousine carrying Reagan and Bush drove towards the Capitol. This was the last time the current president and vice president rode together. Over the past eight years, the Reagan administration reduced taxes and lowered interest rates, leading to a sustained 6.5-year growth in the U.S. economy; in diplomacy, it reached an agreement with the Soviet Union to reduce intermediate-range missiles, which was highly notable. Bush assisted Reagan effectively, earning the title of "Best Vice President." Bush's victory in the presidential election, defeating all competitors, was closely related to this. In his inaugural address, Bush expressed respect to this former president, and the 77-year-old Reagan was moved to tears.

"A new breeze is blowing... We will open new fields, we will take new actions." – While the Reagan administration laid the foundation for the Bush administration, it also left some problems that could not be taken away: the fiscal and trade deficits remain high, the savings and loan system is facing a crisis, the number of drug addicts and homeless people is increasing, and so on. When President Bush said, "The difficulties are great, but our resolve is greater," he indeed had the ambition of a new official taking office; but when he acknowledged that "our wishes are greater than our wallets," it seemed that he also felt powerless. Like Kennedy and Johnson presidents, Bush called on people to make sacrifices for society, but people immediately began to doubt whether the president was hinting at tax increases. Bush emphasized the practice of two-party politics and improving the relationship between the White House and Congress, which is relatively more certain. Both the president and vice president have served as members of Congress, and among the newly appointed cabinet members, there are also members of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.

The 2.5-kilometer road from the Capitol to the White House seems to allow the new president to show his unique talents. Jackson rode a horse, Carter walked, and more presidents took cars. President Bush took a car for a while and walked for a while. 300,000 spectators gathered from all directions on Pennsylvania Avenue. The layers of viewing stands along the street were filled with cheering people. Red, white, and blue tricolor ribbons shaped like flower petals and giant portraits of past presidents were hung on the buildings along the street. All of these decorations were just a part of the $3 million cost.

Today is the climax of the celebration activities. Two days ago, the five-branch honor guard at the Lincoln Memorial opened the curtain of the celebration. From the aircraft carrier "America," 21 aircraft flew in formation at low altitude, and the orange parachutes of the "Sky Knights" with the Stars and Stripes fell from the sky, leaving an impression of "seeking peace through strength." The performers of the "Beach Boys" band hugged Bush's grandson in his arms, swaying back and forth with the music, making people think of Bush's often-said words, "more friendly, more harmonious." Bush lit the torch in front of the memorial hall in the twilight, and he was obviously expressing with his actions: "(The Republican) torch has been passed on!" Bush asked people to turn on the small flashlights in their hands because he had said during his campaign against Dukakis: "This country has millions of bright spots."

The parade on the day of the celebration lasted 3 hours and 40 minutes. The Bush family and their relatives waved and greeted 211 parade formations from the presidential viewing platform outside the main gate of the White House. The first formation, unprecedented, was composed entirely of teachers. Bush had vowed during his campaign to become an "education president" to compete with Europe and Japan in the field of science and technology. The model of the bomber Bush flew in was also in the parade formation. An old retired soldier who had saved Bush said, "We gave Bush a nickname 'Elephant' at the time, who would have thought that decades later he would really become the 'King of Elephants' (the Republican Party is called 'Elephant')."

The reactions of the crowd were varied. A few spectators who obviously came from the Northeast held up a sign: "President Bush and Mrs. Bush, if the weather is too hot, come back to Maine!" Anderson, who was in his 30s and unemployed, still told the reporter, "I think I should run for president." A secretary named Mary, who lives on the opposite bank of the Potomac River, said, "The same old thing, nothing has changed." A priest named Taylor said, "I think all this money was spent on useless things today."

After President Bush took office in the White House, his first mission was to personally guide the first batch of visitors around the White House.

　　走向白宫的时刻
    ——记布什总统就职庆典
    本报记者  景宪法
    １９８９年１月２０日１２点零４分，布什手抚历届美国总统都抚按过的那本圣经，宣誓就任美利坚合众国第４１任总统。
    这是一个尤其值得纪念的时刻：１５２年来，布什是第一位直接从副总统当选总统的人；从乔治·华盛顿宣誓就职到今天，整整是２００周年！
    上午１１时许，“美国１号”林肯牌豪华轿车载着里根和布什驶向国会。这是本届正副总统最后一次并驾齐驱。８年来，里根政府减税收、降利率，使美国经济获得持续６年半的增长；在外交上，同苏联达成削减中程导弹的条约，引人注目。布什辅佐里根得力，获“最佳副总统”之称。布什在竞选中过关斩将，最终赢得问鼎白宫的胜利，与此密切相关。布什在就职演说中向这位前总统表示敬意，７７岁的里根热泪盈眶。
    “新的微风正在吹动……。我们将开辟新的领域，我们将采取新的行动。”——里根政府在为布什政府奠基的同时，也留下了一些无法带走的难题：财政和外贸赤字居高不下、储蓄信贷系统面临危机、瘾君子和无家可归者有增无已，等等。当布什总统说“困难大、决心更大”时，确有新官上任时的鸿鹄之志；但转而承认“愿望大于钱包”时，似乎又有力不从心之感。布什像当年肯尼迪和约翰逊总统那样，号召人们为社会作出牺牲，但人们立刻开始怀疑总统是否暗示增税。布什强调奉行两党政治、搞好白宫与国会的关系，这一点倒是较有把握，正副总统都当过国会议员，新任命的内阁成员中也不乏参众两院之士。
    从国会到白宫的路全长２．５公里，新任总统似乎都能各显神通。杰克逊总统当年策马而行，卡特总统安步当车，更多的总统则是以车代步。布什总统是坐一会儿车、走一会儿路。３０万观众从四面八方拥到宾夕法尼亚大道，道旁层层叠叠的观礼台上挤满了欢呼者。扎成花瓣状的红白蓝三色彩带和历届总统的巨幅画像悬挂在沿街的建筑物上。所有这些装束，只是３千万美元费用中的一部分。
    今天是庆典活动的高潮。两天之前，林肯纪念堂里的五军仪仗队拉开了庆典的帷幕。从“美利坚”号航空母舰上起飞的２１架飞机编队掠过低空，“空中骑士团”那桔黄色的降落伞挂着星条旗从天而降，留下一片“以实力求和平”的印象。“海滩小子”乐队的演员抱过布什怀中的孙子，伴着音乐来回摇晃，使人们联想到布什常说的“更友善、更和睦”这句话。布什在暮色中点燃纪念堂前的火炬，他显然是在用行动表示：“（共和党的）火炬已经接过来了！”布什请人们拧亮手中的小电筒，因为他在同杜卡基斯竞选时就说过：“这个国家有千万点光亮。”
    庆典之日的游行长达３小时４０分。布什夫妇及全家在白宫正门外的总统观礼台上向２１１个游行方阵招手致意。第一块方阵破天荒地全由教师组成。布什在竞选中就曾发誓成为一位“教育总统”，以期在同欧洲、日本的科技竞争中一决高低。布什当年驾驶的轰炸机模型也在游行队列之中。一位拯救过布什的退役老兵说：“我们当时就给布什起了个绰号叫‘大象’，谁也想不到几十年后他果真成了‘大象之王’（共和党被称为‘象’）。”
    人群中的反应各式各样。几位显然是从东北部来的观众举着一块牌子：“布什总统和夫人，如果天气太热，就回到缅因州来！”３０多岁的安德森虽是失业者，但他仍对记者说：“我想我应该去当总统。”住在波托马克河对岸的一位名叫玛利的秘书说：“老一套，没有什么变化。”一位名叫泰勒的神父说：“我看今天的这些钱都花到无用的地方去了。”
    布什总统入主白宫后的第一项使命——亲自在白宫为第一批参观者导游。
