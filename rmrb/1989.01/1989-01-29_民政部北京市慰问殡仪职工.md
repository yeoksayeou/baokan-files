The Ministry of Civil Affairs and the Beijing Municipal Government held a comfort and celebration gathering for funeral service workers today. Over 200 funeral service workers and leaders from the Ministry of Civil Affairs and the municipal party and government gathered together.

In recent years, the 12 funeral homes in Beijing have universally increased their service items and improved their service quality. Social and economic benefits have significantly increased, reversing the long-term reliance on state subsidies, and achieving a surplus. At the same time, the city's cremation rate reached 95.28% in 1988. All streets and towns in the city have established red and white affairs committees or funeral reform leadership groups, with 234 streets and towns achieving a 100% cremation rate.

At the gathering, Vice Minister of Civil Affairs Fan Baojun and Deputy Mayor of Beijing He Luli expressed their comfort to the funeral service workers. National labor model and young embalmer Liu Ruian spoke at the meeting.

Ni Zhifu and Yang Jingren attended the gathering.
