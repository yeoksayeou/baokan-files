	Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens today reiterated his opposition to talks with the Palestine Liberation Organization and again criticized the United States for holding talks with Palestinians.

	Arens made the remarks at his first press conference since taking over as Israel's foreign minister last December. Since taking office, he has yet to propose any new policies.

	He claimed, "We believe that establishing contact, or even worse, recognizing the Palestine Liberation Organization, will not promote Middle East peace. On the contrary, this will only encourage extremists and more acts of violence."

	In criticizing the U.S. decision to hold talks with the PLO, Arens said, "We are concerned that this decision may weaken our ability to combat the scourge of international terrorism."

	Meanwhile, it was reported that four Israeli parliament members, along with representatives from the PLO, will participate in a European discussion on Middle East peace to be held in Paris from January 12 to 13.

　　以外长阿伦斯老调重弹
    以色列反对同巴解组织会谈
    新华社开罗１月３日电  据来自耶路撒冷的消息说，以色列外交部长摩西·阿伦斯今天重申反对同巴勒斯坦解放组织会谈，并再次批评美国同巴勒斯坦人举行会谈。
    阿伦斯是在他去年１２月担任以色列外长以来第一次举行的记者招待会上表示上述立场的。他就职以来，迄今尚未提出新的政策。
    他声称，“我们认为，建立接触，或者说得更糟一点，进而承认巴勒斯坦解放组织，不能促进中东和平。相反，这样做只会鼓励极端分子和更多的暴力行动。”
    阿伦斯在批评美国作出同巴解组织会谈的决定时说：“我们担心，这种决定可能削弱我们对付国际恐怖主义祸害的能力。”
    另据报道，４名以色列议会议员同巴解组织的代表一道，将参加１月１２至１３日在巴黎召开的关于中东和平的欧洲讨论会。
