Experts have confirmed through investigation and testing that hairy clams from the Honghai area of Lushui Xiaomiao in Startown County carry the hepatitis A virus. The Nantong Municipal Government has decided to ban the fishing of hairy clams. Relevant departments such as health, commerce, fisheries, and fishery administration have dispatched law enforcement personnel to conduct on-site inspections and supervision, and will take administrative measures and impose economic penalties on those who violate the ban.

In March of last year, relevant departments of Jiangsu Province organized 27 experts to investigate the contamination of hairy clams. They collected samples on-site and sent them to the Institute of Virology at the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine, the Military Medical Research Institute in Nanjing, the Drug and Biological Product Inspection Institute of the Ministry of Health, and the health epidemic prevention stations in Shanghai and Jiangsu Province for pathogen testing. These institutions all found hepatitis A virus particles in the hairy clams.

　　启东毛蚶确有甲肝病毒
    南通市政府决定禁止捕捞
    本报上海１月３日电  经专家调查检验确认：启东县吕泗小庙洪海域所产毛蚶带有甲肝病毒，南通市政府已作出禁止捕捞毛蚶的决定。市卫生、工商、水产、渔政等部门也派出执法人员实地检查、监督，对违令捕捞者分别作出行政处理和经济处罚。
    去年３月，江苏省有关部门组织２７位专家对毛蚶污染情况进行调查，实地采集标本，分送中国预防医学科学院病毒研究所、南京军事科学研究所、卫生部药品生物制品检验所、上海市和江苏省的卫生防疫站，进行病原学检验。这些单位均发现毛蚶中有甲肝病毒颗粒。
