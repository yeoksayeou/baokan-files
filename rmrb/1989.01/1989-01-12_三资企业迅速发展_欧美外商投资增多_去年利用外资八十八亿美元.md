The pace of utilizing foreign capital in China accelerated in 1988. According to statistics provided by the National Bureau of Statistics, the total agreed foreign investment for the year is expected to reach approximately $12.5 billion, with $7 billion in foreign loans and $4.5 billion in direct foreign investment. The actual amount of foreign capital utilized is expected to reach $8.8 billion, an increase of over 25% compared to the previous year.

Over the past year, as various regions have strengthened the selection of investment projects, "three-resource" enterprises have rapidly developed, and the investment structure has significantly improved. By the end of November last year, out of the 4,801 approved "three-resource" enterprise contracts in China, 85% were production-oriented projects, with the majority being export-oriented and technologically advanced enterprises.

Investment from developed countries such as Europe and America has increased, and the intention of some foreign large enterprise groups to invest in China has strengthened. In the first three quarters of last year, the cumulative investment from countries such as the Federal Republic of Germany, France, and Italy, which are members of the European Economic Community, reached nearly $200 million, an increase of 2.3 times compared to the same period last year. By the end of November last year, 240 foreign-funded enterprise contracts had been approved, an increase of five times compared to the same period last year.

　　三资企业迅速发展　欧美外商投资增多
    去年利用外资八十八亿美元
    据新华社北京１月１０日电  （记者徐克洪）１９８８年我国利用外资的步伐加快。据国家统计局提供的数字，全年外商协议投资额可达到１２５亿美元左右，其中向外借款和外商直接投资协议额分别约为７０亿美元和４５亿美元；实际利用外资额将达到８８亿美元，比上年增长１／４强。
    去年以来，由于各地加强了对投资项目的选择，“三资”企业在迅速发展的同时，投资结构也得到了明显的改善。截至去年１１月底，我国批准的４８０１个“三资”企业合同中，生产型项目占８５％，产品出口企业和技术先进企业占绝大多数。
    欧美等发达国家外商投资增多，一些国外大企业集团来我国投资的意向增强。去年前三个季度，联邦德国、法国、意大利等欧洲共同体成员国累计投资额近２亿美元，比上年同期增长２．３倍。截至去年１１月底，已批准外商独资企业合同２４０个，比上年同期增长５倍。
