The Chinese Academy of Sciences National Conditions Analysis Research Group, after two years of investigation and research, proposes that China's modernization development should fully consider national conditions and adopt a model of low resource consumption and moderate consumption. This means implementing relatively low levels of food consumption, energy consumption, housing standards, and water consumption.

The research group, commissioned by the State Council's Rural Development Research Center, in the report "A Systematic Study on Several Long-Term Development Issues in China's Rural Areas," points out that even if population control is strictly enforced starting now, by around 2020, the total population will reach 1.5 billion. Currently, China's agricultural resources are not only low in per capita availability, but the core of China's agricultural resources—arable land—is decreasing by several million mu each year. Additionally, environmental pollution and ecological degradation are becoming increasingly severe, and grain demand will far exceed supply. These national conditions will be important factors constraining China's social modernization process.

Based on this situation, the report believes that China's modernization process will be a long-term historical process of gradual change, accumulation, and partial qualitative change, requiring several generations of sustained efforts to complete.

The report proposes that the core idea of this non-traditional modernization model is to implement a production system with low resource consumption; a living system with moderate consumption; an economic system that ensures sustained and stable economic growth and continuously improves economic efficiency; a social system that guarantees social benefits and social equity; a technological system that continuously innovates and fully absorbs new technologies, methods, and techniques; an international economic system that promotes close ties with the global market, is more open to trade and non-trade activities; and a system that rationally develops and utilizes resources, prevents pollution, and protects ecological balance. The report was written by Hu Angang and Wang Yi.

　　中科院国情分析研究小组提出
    我国现代化发展要充分考虑国情
  　应取低度消耗资源适度消费模式
    据新华社北京１月５日电  （记者萧家保）中国科学院国情分析研究小组通过两年的调查研究后提出：我国现代化的发展要充分考虑国情特点，采取低度消耗资源和适度消费的模式。即实行较低的食物消费水平、较低的能源消耗水平、较低的住房水平与较低的用水消费水平。
    这个研究小组受国务院农村发展研究中心委托，在《关于中国农村长期发展几个问题的系统研究》的报告中指出，即使从现在起严格控制人口，到２０２０年前后，全国总人口数也将达到１５亿。目前，我国农业资源不仅人均占有量低，而且中国农业资源的精华——可耕地，每年仍以几百万亩的速度减少。此外，我国环境污染与自然生态的恶化日趋严重，粮食需求将远远大于供给。我国国情的上述特点将是制约我国社会现代化进程的重要因素。
    基于这种情况，报告认为中国现代化过程将是一个不断渐变的、积累的、进而部分质变的长期历史过程，需要几代人长期不懈的努力才能完成。
    报告提出，这种非传统的现代化模式的核心思想就是实行低度消耗资源的生产体系；适度消费的生活体系；使经济持续稳定增长、经济效益不断提高的经济体系；保证社会效益与社会公平的社会体系；不断创新、充分吸收新技术、新工艺、新方法的适用技术体系；促进与世界市场紧密联系的、更加开放的贸易与非贸易国际经济体系；合理开发利用资源、防止污染、保护生态平衡。报告由胡鞍钢、王毅执笔。
