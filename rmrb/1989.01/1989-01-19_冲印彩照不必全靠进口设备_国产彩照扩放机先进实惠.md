Color photo enlargement does not have to rely solely on imported equipment. Domestic color photo enlargers are advanced and practical.

Our reporter, He Huangbiao, reports: The Capital Machinery Factory under the Ministry of Aerospace Industry has applied advanced electronic technology, precise sensors, and sensitive control circuits to develop a color photo enlarger suitable for small and medium-sized photo studios and photography enthusiasts. It has recently passed the appraisal by the Ministry of Aerospace Industry.

In recent years, color photographs have rapidly become popular in both urban and rural areas in China. "Taking photos should be in color," has become the preference of the people. However, the corresponding color developing equipment has been imported from abroad at a high cost in foreign exchange, and is only available in a few major cities in professional units. Facing this problem, the technical personnel of the Ministry of Aerospace Industry have worked hard to develop equipment with a simple structure and a price not exceeding 2,000 yuan, which can perform the functions of developing, color correction, and matching processes similar to imported equipment. The operation process of this machine can automatically control temperature, light measurement, timing, digital display, and automatic alarm. Its developing, enlarging, and printing capacity is 135 film rolls at 12 rolls per hour, 120 film rolls at 8 rolls per hour, or enlarging photographs, with a maximum enlargement of 12 inches. This machine can use any type of developer, photographic paper, and 135, 120 color negative film produced by domestic manufacturers.

　　冲印彩照不必全靠进口设备
  　国产彩照扩放机先进实惠
    本报讯  记者何黄彪报道：航空航天工业部首都机械厂应用先进的电子技术、精密的传感件和灵敏的控制线路，研制出适合广大中、小型照像馆及摄影爱好者使用的彩照扩放机，日前通过航空航天部鉴定。
    近年来，彩色照片在我国城乡迅速普及。“照像就要照带色的”，已成为人民群众的喜好。但是，与之配套的彩色冲洗设备，是花了许多外汇从国外进口的，而且只有在少数大城市的专业单位才有。针对这个问题，航空航天部的科技人员奋力攻关，研制出结构简单、价格不超过２０００元的设备同样能完成进口设备所具有的冲洗、校色、配套工序的功能。该机操作过程能自动控制温度、验光、计时、数字显示和自动报警。它的冲卷、扩印、放大能力为每小时冲１３５胶卷１２卷，１２０胶卷８卷或扩放照片，最大可放大１２寸。该机可使用国内任何厂家生产的药水、相纸和１３５、１２０彩色负片胶卷。
