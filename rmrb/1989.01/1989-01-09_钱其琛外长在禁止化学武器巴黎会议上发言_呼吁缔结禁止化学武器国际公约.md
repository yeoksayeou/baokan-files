Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen spoke at the plenary session of the Paris Conference on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons today, calling for the early conclusion of a comprehensive international convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons and proposing four specific measures. In his speech, Qian analyzed the current international situation, expounded on the necessity and urgency of prohibiting chemical weapons, and stated China's consistent stance and proposals on this issue, which were warmly welcomed by the attending representatives.

Qian Qichen pointed out in his speech that for many years, the international community has made unremitting efforts to achieve the complete elimination of chemical weapons from the earth. Currently, the most effective way to truly and thoroughly prohibit chemical weapons and free humanity from the threat of chemical weapons is to conclude a comprehensive international convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons as soon as possible. In this regard, the Geneva Disarmament Conference has made significant progress, but there are still some obstacles that need to be overcome. China proposes the following four measures:

First, firmly uphold the effectiveness of the 1925 Geneva Protocol. All signatory states must faithfully fulfill their obligations under the Protocol not to use chemical weapons. We call on non-signatory states to also adhere to this international norm and join the Protocol as soon as possible to enhance its universality.

Second, we call on the member states of the Geneva Disarmament Conference to accelerate negotiations and conclude a new international convention as soon as possible, including the prohibition of the development, production, acquisition, stockpiling, retention, and use of chemical weapons. The new convention should prioritize the complete destruction of existing chemical weapons and their production facilities, ensuring that no new chemical weapons are produced, and preventing the emergence of new chemical weapons. To ensure compliance, necessary and effective verification measures should be stipulated.

Third, countries with the largest chemical weapon arsenals should take the lead in guaranteeing an immediate halt to the development, production, and transfer of chemical weapons, ensuring that they will never use such weapons, and destroying them in the shortest possible time.

Fourth, all countries with the capability to develop chemical weapons should stop research and production of chemical weapons.

Qian emphasized that the prohibition of chemical weapons should be an important disarmament task. While emphasizing the importance of nuclear and conventional disarmament, it is also necessary to regard the comprehensive prohibition of chemical weapons as an urgent and important task and goal. He discussed the necessity and urgency from five aspects: 1. Chemical weapons are extremely barbaric and detestable weapons of mass destruction with terrible destructive power; 2. They are considered by some countries as a component of a "reliable deterrent force" and an important factor in military strength; 3. With the development of science and technology, the updating of chemical weapons is accelerating, and a new generation of super-toxic agents and toxins is about to emerge; 4. The technology required for chemical weapons is not high, the cost is low, and they can be mass-produced easily. Their proliferation has become a real problem; 5. Over the past half-century, the use of chemical weapons has taken the lives of millions of people. The shadow of chemical warfare has always hung over the world, threatening humanity.

After reviewing the changes in the international situation in recent years, Qian said that the world is moving from confrontation to dialogue, from tension to relaxation, and this has become a trend. Maintaining peace and seeking development have become the two major themes facing humanity. People should seize these new opportunities without missing the chance, while also being soberly aware of and accepting the challenges. For the survival and development of humanity and for lasting peace, all forms of arms races must be stopped.

In discussing China's principled stance on the prohibition of chemical weapons, Qian said that China neither possesses nor produces chemical weapons. China is a signatory to the Geneva Protocol and has always opposed the use of chemical weapons, opposed any form of chemical weapons proliferation, and also opposed any country using the issue of chemical weapons to threaten the security of others. Qian expressed that China will continue to actively participate in negotiations on the prohibition of chemical weapons and support the United Nations Secretary-General, authorized by the Security Council, in continuing to play a role in investigating the use of chemical weapons.

In concluding his speech, Qian said that the arrival of 1989 means that people are about to bid farewell to the 1980s and welcome a new decade full of hope. The current international situation is very favorable, and people should seize this historic opportunity. As long as people around the world work together and persist, they will surely win peace, win development, and win a better world.

　　钱其琛外长在禁止化学武器巴黎会议上发言
    呼吁缔结禁止化学武器国际公约
    本报巴黎１月８日电  记者张启华报道：在今天上午举行的禁止化学武器巴黎会议全体会议上，中国代表团团长、外交部长钱其琛发言，呼吁尽快缔结一项全面禁止化学武器国际公约，并为此提出４项具体建议。钱外长在发言中分析了当前国际形势，阐述了禁止化学武器的必要性和迫切性，以及我国政府在这个问题上的一贯立场和主张，受到了与会代表的热烈欢迎。
    钱其琛外长在发言中指出，许多年来，国际社会为争取早日实现从地球上彻底消除化学武器进行了不懈的努力。当前要真正彻底禁止化学武器，使人类摆脱化学武器的威胁，最有效的途径是尽快缔结一项全面禁止化学武器的国际公约。在这方面，日内瓦裁军谈判取得了明显的进展，然而，还有一些障碍需要克服。中国建议采取以下４项措施：
    一、坚决维护１９２５年日内瓦议定书的有效性。所有缔约国都必须切实履行对议定书所承担的不使用化学武器的义务。呼吁非缔约国也遵守这一国际准则，并尽早加入议定书，以增强其普遍性。
    二、呼吁日内瓦裁军谈判会议成员国加速谈判，尽早缔结一项包括禁止研制、生产、取得、储存、保留和使用化学武器的国际公约。新的公约应把解决彻底销毁现有化学武器及其生产设施、保证不再生产新的化学武器和防止出现新的化学武器作为其首要目标，为确保遵约，应规定必要和有效的核查措施。
    三、拥有最大化学武库的国家，应率先保证立即停止发展、生产、转让化学武器，保证决不使用这种武器，并在尽可能短的时间内予以销毁。
    四、一切拥有发展化学武器能力的国家，都应停止研制和不生产化学武器。
    钱外长在发言中强调，禁止化学武器应作为一项重要的裁军任务，在坚持重视核裁军和常规裁军的同时，还必须把全面禁止化学武器视为迫切、重要的任务和奋斗目标。他从５个方面论述了它的必要性和紧迫性：１，化学武器是一种极其野蛮、可憎的大规模毁灭性武器，具有可怕的杀伤力；２，它被一些国家视为“可靠的威慑力量”的组成部分和军事实力的重要因素；３，随着科学技术的发展，化学武器的更新换代正在加速进行，新一代超毒性毒剂、毒素等化学武器即将问世；４，化学武器技术要求不高，成本低廉，容易大批量生产，它的扩散已成为一个现实问题；５，半个世纪来，化学武器的使用已夺去了千万人的生命。化学战的阴影始终笼罩着世界，威胁着人类。
    钱外长在回顾近几年来国际形势发生的变化后说，世界正从对抗转向对话，由紧张走向缓和，并已成为潮流。维护和平和谋求发展已成为人类面临的两大主题。人们要不失时机地抓住这些新的机会，同时也要清醒地看到和接受挑战。为了人类的生存和发展，为了持久的和平，制止一切形式的军备竞赛。
    在谈到中国对禁止化学武器的原则立场时，钱外长说，中国既不拥有也不生产化学武器。中国是《日内瓦议定书》的缔约国，一贯反对使用化学武器，反对任何形式的化学武器扩散，同时也反对任何国家在化学武器问题上制造借口威胁别国的安全。钱外长表示，中国将继续积极参加有关禁止化学武器的谈判，支持联合国秘书长根据安理会的授权，在调查使用化学武器问题上继续发挥作用。
    钱外长在结束他的发言时说，１９８９年的到来，说明人们即将送走８０年代，迎来一个充满希望的新的１０年。当前国际形势非常有利，人们应抓住这一历史性的机会。只要全世界人民共同努力并坚持下去，人们一定能够赢得和平，赢得发展，赢得一个更加美好的世界。
