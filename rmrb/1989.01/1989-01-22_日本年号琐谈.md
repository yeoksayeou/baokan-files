On the morning of January 7, Emperor Hirohito of Japan, who had been on the throne for 62 years, passed away in the imperial palace in Tokyo. That same morning, Crown Prince Akihito ascended to the throne. The Japanese government announced a change in the era name, from "Showa" to "Heisei," effective January 8.

Japan's era names have historically been drawn from Chinese classics. The era name "Heisei" is taken from the "Records of the Grand Historian" and the "Book of Documents." The "Records of the Grand Historian" states, "The father is righteous, the mother is kind, the elder brother is friendly, the younger brother is respectful, the son is filial, and the family is harmonious." The "Book of Documents" contains the phrase, "The land is level and the heavens are complete, the six ministries and three affairs are in order, and the world relies on it forever." The Japanese government explained that "Heisei" signifies the hope for peace within the country and between heaven and earth.

Historical records show that Japan began using era names, modeled after Chinese dynasties, starting with Emperor Kotoku's reign in 645 AD, with the era name "Taika." Except for a brief period in the late 7th century, era names have been used continuously since 701 AD. Over the past 1,300 years, 90 emperors have changed the era name 247 times. Japan considers era names as auspicious symbols for long-term governance. In the past, era names were changed not only with the succession of emperors but also during times of good or bad fortune, natural disasters, or celestial anomalies. For example, during the reign of Emperor Go-Daigo, the era name was changed eight times. The practice of "one era per reign" was institutionalized during the Meiji period in the 19th century. Statistics show that of the 247 era names used so far, more than 70 Chinese classics have been referenced, with the most frequently cited being the "Book of Documents," "Book of Changes," "Selections of Refined Literature," "Book of the Later Han," and "Book of the Former Han."

In the past, the selection of era names involved scholars of Chinese classics, such as the Doctor of Literature and the Assistant Minister of Ceremonies, who would propose plans. Senior officials would then discuss and the emperor would make the final decision. However, after World War II, the emperor's status changed from a "living god" to a national symbol, and the old imperial regulations were abolished, making the establishment of era names legally untenable. In 1946, the Japanese government proposed a bill, but it was rejected by the occupying Allied forces as it implied recognition of the emperor's authority. In 1979, during the Nakasone administration, the "Era Name Law" was passed, stipulating that era names are to be established by government ordinance and only changed upon the succession of a new emperor. This time, the government's establishment of the era name is the first instance of such a process.

The procedure for selecting an era name involves the prime minister appointing a small number of renowned scholars to propose multiple plans. The Chief Cabinet Secretary then researches and compiles the proposals, reporting to the prime minister, who then seeks the opinion of the Director of the Legislative Bureau. A meeting of wise individuals is convened, and finally, the prime minister seeks the opinions of the Speaker and Vice-Speaker of the Diet before the Cabinet decides and submits it to the new emperor for signature. The criteria for selecting an era name are that it should consist of two Chinese characters, be easy to write and read, and be auspicious. It should not use era names, titles, or palace names that have been used in Japan, China, Korea, or Vietnam. Obviously, only a scholar well-versed in Chinese classics can undertake this task.

Japanese newspapers revealed that the Japanese government began preparing for the new era name a decade ago, with the entire process conducted in secrecy. Last year, as Emperor Hirohito's health deteriorated, the selection process was accelerated. By the end of last year, the plan was "kept in a safe." On the day of Emperor Hirohito's death, the Japanese government, following the established procedure, finally selected "Heisei" from among the three proposals: "Heisei," "Shufu," and "Seika." According to the director of the Cabinet Office's Internal Affairs Bureau, the process involved cross-referencing more than 1,300 era names and titles from the histories of China, Japan, and Korea, and it was confirmed that the characters "Heisei" had not been used before.

Regarding the new era name, the Japanese government stated that citizens are not legally obligated to use it. There are two main opinions within Japan on the use of era names. One side argues that era names have been used for a long time in Japanese history and have become ingrained in the national sentiment. Those who oppose it believe that in an era of globalization, some Japanese companies' documents already use the Gregorian calendar, making era names meaningless. Others point out that the era name "Showa" was taken from the "Book of Documents," "The Canon of Yao," which states, "The people are enlightened, and the world is in harmony," but the first 20 years of the Showa era were marked by external aggression, completely contrary to the spirit of "harmony with all nations." It is hoped that Japan will truly embody the meaning of "Heisei" and achieve internal and external peace.

　　日本年号琐谈
    孙东民
    今年１月７日清晨，在位达６２年的日本天皇裕仁在东京的皇宫里病逝。同日上午，皇太子明仁即位。日本政府宣布改元，年号由“昭和”改为“平成”，１月８日起施行。
    日本的年号，历代均取自中国典籍。平成年号引自《史记》和《书经》。《史记·五帝本纪》有“父义，母慈，兄友，弟恭，子孝，内平外成”，《书经·大禹谟》中有“地平天成，六府三事允治，万世永赖、时乃功”的章句。日本政府解释说，“平成”是取其“希望国内外，天地间实现和平”之意。
    史书记载，日本的天皇仿中国的王朝使用年号始于孝德天皇即位的公元６４５年，建元“大化”。除７世纪后期的一个时期外，公元７０１年以来均制定年号。迄今１３００多年中９０位天皇共改元２４７次。日本把年号视为可长治久安的吉祥物，以往的改元除天皇更替外，遇有吉凶祸福，天地异变时可改元。如在后醍醐天皇时期就８次改元，把“一世一元”制度化是在１９世纪的明治时期。据统计，迄今２４７个年号中，引用过７０余种中国典籍，最多的是《书经》、《易经》、《文选》、《后汉书》、《汉书》等典籍。
    选定年号时，以往先由文章博士、式部大辅等涉猎中国古典，提出方案，重臣合议，天皇自己决定，但二次大战后，天皇由“现人神”变成国家象征，旧皇室典范废除，制定元号失去法律根据。１９４６年，日本政府曾提出法案，但被进驻的盟军总部以等于承认天皇的权威为由否定。１９７９年大平内阁时期通过了“元号法”，规定年号由政令制定，只限于新天皇继承皇位时改元，这次由政府制定年号尚属首次。
    年号选定的手续是由首相确定少数知名的学者，委托提出复数方案，由官房长官对方案研究整理，报告首相，再征求法制局长官的意见，集有识之士召开座谈会，最后由首相征求国会议长、副议长的意见后，由内阁全体会议决定，交新天皇签署。年号的选定标准是由２个汉字组成，易写、易读、吉祥，不用日本、中国、朝鲜、越南等已用过的年号、封号或宫殿名，显然，非博学的汉学家极难胜任。
    日本报纸披露，日本政府着手制定新年号，早在１０年前已开始准备，整个过程都在秘密中进行。去年裕仁天皇病重后加快了选定的步伐，去年年底，其方案“已保管在保险箱里”。裕仁天皇病逝的当天，日本政府按照既定的手续，最终从“平成”、“修文”、“正化”三个方案中确定为“平成”。据内阁内政审议室长说明，其间曾核对过中国、日本、朝鲜等历史上１３００多个年号、封号，“平成”二字未被使用过。
    对于新年号，日本政府说明国民没有强制使用的法律义务。日本国内对使用年号有两种意见，一种认为年号在日本历史中长期使用，已溶入国民的感情”；持反对意见者认为在国际化的时代，日本的一些企业的文件中，有的已惯用公元，年号已失去意义；还有的人指出“昭和”的年号取自《书经·尧典》“百姓昭明，协和万邦”，意本在与世界协调，然而昭和的前２０年却对外发动侵略战争，完全与“协和万邦”背道而驰。但愿日本今后真取“平成”之意，实现内外的和平。
