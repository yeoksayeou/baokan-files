Establishing an investment mechanism that integrates responsibility, authority, and benefits to improve investment efficiency is a crucial task in China's investment system reform. This article will explore this issue.

Target Model: Who Invests, Who Decides, Who Owns, Who Benefits

Deepening China's investment system reform involves a critical issue: adhering to what "model" and moving towards what goal. Based on China's overall strategic development of a planned commodity economy, I believe the key to investment system reform is to address the integration of responsibility, authority, and benefits. By leveraging the interest mechanism to motivate various parties, we can maximize investment efficiency and promote significant development in social productivity. To achieve this, we must establish a model of "who invests, who decides, who owns, who benefits."

This model is a complete and organic whole, with different layers of meaning. Firstly, "who invests, who decides" means the unity of the investment entity and the investment decision. In China's economic life, the main investment entities are the state and enterprises. State investment funds are raised by the financial department, and the planning department, together with relevant departments, exercises investment decision-making power on behalf of the state, which is understandable. The problem lies in enterprise investment. Due to the past lack of recognition of enterprises, especially state-owned enterprises, as relatively independent commodity producers, they have long been treated as appendages of state organs. Therefore, enterprises basically have no investment decision-making power. In recent years, with the advancement of economic system reform, both theoretical and practical workers have reached a consensus on the issue of enterprises having a certain degree of investment decision-making power. However, there is still a significant disagreement on the term "certain," mainly due to concerns that if enterprises have too much investment decision-making power, it will affect the macroeconomic balance, leading to short-term behavior, repeated construction, and blind construction. I believe these concerns are unnecessary. The key is that under the true realization of separation of government and enterprise, making enterprises "weaned off," enterprise investment mainly comes from the enterprise's own accumulation and borrowed funds. The enterprise's own accumulation is directly regulated by state taxation, and borrowed funds are mainly regulated by state financial policies. These two economic levers are in the hands of the state. We should focus on studying how to improve the macro-control mechanism and strengthen the enterprise's self-discipline, rather than being too specific about whether the enterprise should invest and how to invest. With the separation of government and enterprise and the gradual establishment of the enterprise's self-discipline mechanism, the investment decision-making power should be returned to the enterprise. This is an important prerequisite for promoting enterprise development and improving investment efficiency.

Secondly, "who invests, who owns" means solving the responsibility, authority, and benefits issue from the ownership structure. China is an economic system dominated by socialist public ownership. The past mistake was the one-sided understanding of "public ownership." In the investment field, the current focus is on the assets formed by state-owned enterprises using their own accumulation (borrowed funds will eventually be reflected in the form of enterprise accumulation) for investment. Due to the lack of recognition in practice that this part of the assets belongs to the enterprise legal person or all employees of the enterprise, this part of the assets has the right to participate in the enterprise's profit distribution and can bring benefits to all employees. This leads to the enterprise's short-term behavior of prioritizing consumption over accumulation, which is not conducive to the expansion of production and operation scale and the development of productivity. Based on a serious consideration of socialist ownership relations, I believe that "who invests, who owns" will not weaken the socialist public ownership foundation ("enterprise ownership" is also a form of public ownership). It will instead stimulate the enterprise's investment enthusiasm and highly value the economical use of investment and the improvement of economic benefits.

Thirdly, "who invests, who benefits" means directly linking the investor's interests (investment mistakes leading to losses can be seen as the negative value of "benefits," so it also includes the meaning of "who invests, who bears the risk"). In China, state investment, personal investment, foreign investment, and collective enterprise investment are directly linked to their respective interests, which basically do not pose problems. The difficulty lies in state-owned enterprises. Currently, enterprise investment has both the aspect of decision-making errors without bearing risks and the aspect of enterprise investment benefits being detached from the interests of decision-makers and all employees. "Who invests, who benefits" is the core of clarifying the investor's interests through the interest mechanism, strengthening the investor's responsibility, and thus promoting the enterprise's self-interest in improving investment efficiency. This is the biggest feature and advantage of this model.

Practical Path: Scientific Decision-Making and Strengthening the Responsibility System

State investment refers to direct investment through state financial funds. Due to the state's special position in economic life, state investment has its own characteristics. Firstly, social macroeconomic benefits are its primary goal, which determines that certain low-profit industries and some projects and institutions with no economic income, necessary for national livelihood, can only be built by state investment. Secondly, many large and extra-large projects, with high investment and long cycles, are beyond the current capacity of enterprises and banks but are necessary for national economic development, generally also requiring state investment. Thirdly, national defense investment, new technology risk investment, and the development of economically underdeveloped regions. These characteristics are important prerequisites for further discussion.

In recent years, to improve the efficiency of state investment, many beneficial explorations have been conducted and achieved certain results. However, due to the characteristics of state investment, the difficulty in establishing a mutually constraining economic relationship among the investment entity, decision-maker, and implementer, and the difficulty in implementing the principle of integrating responsibility, authority, and benefits, the expected goals are far from being achieved. As a practical path, the key lies in two areas: firstly, striving to achieve scientific decision-making for projects and strictly following scientific project management procedures. The core is to do a good job in project feasibility studies, especially national economic evaluations. Secondly, improving the bidding, tendering, and contracting system, and establishing a strict economic responsibility system for the entire process of decision-making and implementation. Through the decomposition and specification of various responsibilities, without changing the ownership form, fully considering the characteristics of state investment and the movement law of investment funds, fully utilizing various relatively clear economic constraints to achieve the unity of responsibility, authority, and benefits, thereby promoting the improvement of state investment efficiency.

Important Key: Rationalizing the Economic Interest Relationship Between the State and Enterprises

In the traditional socialist economy, the state and enterprises are basically in a "parent-child" relationship. In investment, the most prominent manifestation is the state's non-repayable investment and the enterprise's non-repayable use. Since the economic system reform, efforts have been made to change this pattern, but overall, the progress has been limited. Deepening enterprise reform is an important part of China's economic system reform. How to strengthen enterprise investment constraints and establish a mechanism for enterprises to self-regulate investment demand is an important issue. The key is to gradually rationalize the economic interest relationship between the state and enterprises. Currently, not only is the implementation process of converting state budget internal investment grants to loans (abbreviated as "grant-to-loan") unclear in the property relationship between the state and enterprises, but the enterprise's "pre-tax loan repayment" system also directly offsets the bank's investment credit constraint on enterprises. These two issues need to be resolved urgently.

For this purpose, I suggest: firstly, canceling the current "grant-to-loan" system and implementing a dual-track system of grants and loans. Fixed assets formed by financial grants should, through the state-owned asset management bureau, represent the state to participate in the profit distribution of production projects with state-owned assets; loans should be managed by banks according to investment credit principles. Secondly, reforming the enterprise's "pre-tax loan repayment" system, clearly stipulating that investment credit should be repaid and interest paid by enterprises with their own funds. There are two issues worth discussing: firstly, enterprises currently lack the ability to repay investment loans with after-tax profits, and implementing "post-tax repayment" has certain difficulties under the current tax burden. The solution is to adjust the tax burden appropriately according to the principle of efficiency; secondly, it should be clearly stipulated that after enterprises use their own funds to repay loans, this part of the new assets should be recorded in the enterprise's asset account and owned by the enterprise. The investment benefits or risks brought by this should be enjoyed or borne by the enterprise. For enterprises that raise funds for investment by issuing bonds and stocks, the formed assets should also be owned by the enterprise. This way, property relations can be clarified, and due to the establishment of a true lending relationship between banks and enterprises, the enterprise's loan repayment awareness and the bank's responsibility for loan recovery are strengthened, which is also conducive to suppressing investment demand and promoting the improvement of investment efficiency.

Main Approach: Strengthening the Bank's Role in Investment Regulation

With the development of a planned commodity economy, the role of bank loans in investment activities is becoming increasingly significant. By the end of 1987, the balance of bank fixed asset investment loans exceeded 120 billion yuan, and the annual issuance amount accounted for 24.6% of the fixed asset investment of state-owned units, becoming an important source of funds for fixed asset investment. Strengthening the bank's regulatory role in investment activities is an important aspect of improving investment efficiency. From the perspective of the current economy, the following aspects need to be deepened in reform.

Firstly, improving the central bank's macro-control mechanism, through monetary policy to suppress excessive investment demand, so that the entire investment activity can achieve a virtuous cycle and maximum increase in a relaxed environment. The traditional economic system is basically a fiscal-dominated economy. Due to the special position of finance in the distribution and redistribution of national income, fiscal balance is dominant, and the expansion and contraction of fiscal investment directly determine the size of the investment scale. With the deepening of economic system reform and the change in the pattern of national income distribution, the degree of economic creditization and monetization has significantly increased, and the role of banks in the national economy is gradually strengthening. The pattern of a financial-dominated economy is taking shape. This fully reflects the objective necessity of the development of a planned commodity economy. To maintain the balance of total investment demand and total supply at the macro level, the central government must implement a macroeconomic policy that emphasizes both development and stability, adhere to the principle of comprehensive balance of finance and credit, and the central bank strictly controls the money supply. The state arranges the scale of investment credit and the issuance scale of construction bonds under the premise of credit balance, so as to create an economic environment conducive to the improvement of investment efficiency.

Secondly, banks should have the autonomy to issue investment loans. This issue has been raised for many years but has not been resolved. Credit funds are different from financial funds. They are mainly funds raised by banks through credit methods from the temporarily idle funds of tens of thousands of households, which are the bank's liabilities to customers. Not only must they be guaranteed to be repaid, but interest must also be paid. This determines that the issuance of bank credit funds must consider not only the term but also the profit, realizing increase and virtuous cycle. Considering China's current system, reforms can be carried out in two aspects: firstly, reducing the scope of budgetary directive investments, handing over some profitable projects to enterprises, enterprise groups, and bank loans for investment and construction, and reducing the pressure of state investment; secondly, expanding the investment decision-making power of enterprises, gradually realizing the transformation from state investment-led productive construction projects to enterprise-led ones, and returning the bank's investment loan power to the banks. Let the banks autonomously choose projects in the state-planned investment market, bear risks, operate independently, and use the flexible leverage of loans, more loans, fewer loans, late loans, early loans, and interest rates to regulate investment demand and direction. Through the close integration of their own interests with the income of investment loan projects, they can greatly promote the improvement of investment efficiency.

Thirdly, fully leveraging the regulatory role of investment loan interest rates. With China's economic reform from direct control to indirect control, the regulatory role of loan interest rates in investment activities will become increasingly significant. Seriously studying and determining China's investment loan interest rate system and the regulatory role of interest rates is a very important issue. A reasonable investment loan interest rate system should not only reflect the state's industrial policy and financial policy for a certain period but also use industry differential interest rates to limit long-term and promote short-term, so as to promote the rational development of the national economy structure. At the same time, it is necessary to fully consider reflecting the time value of funds and completely change the current unreasonable situation of long-term and short-term loan interest rates. For loans specially supported by the state, financial subsidies should be implemented. A floating interest rate policy should be implemented to adjust investment demand and supply through interest rate increases and decreases. In the context of China's excessive enterprise investment demand, regulating and controlling investment through investment loan interest rates will definitely achieve more significant effects than administrative measures.

　　从提高效益出发　深化投资体制改革
    赵玉琢
    建立责、权、利相结合的投资机制，提高投资效益是我国投资体制改革的一项重要任务。本文仅就这个问题作些探讨。
    目标模式：谁投资、谁决策、谁所有、谁受益
    深化我国投资体制改革，一个重要问题是遵循什么“模式”，朝着什么目标去改。根据我国有计划商品经济发展的总体战略，我认为投资体制改革的关键是解决责、权、利的结合问题，通过利益机制调动各方面的积极性，最大限度地提高投资效益，促进社会生产力有一个较大的发展。为此，必须建立“谁投资、谁决策、谁所有、谁受益”的模式。
    这一模式是一个完整的有机整体，同时又有着不同层次的含义。首先是“谁投资、谁决策”，即投资主体与投资决策的统一。从我国经济生活看，投资主体主要是国家与企业。国家投资的资金由财政筹集，计划部门会同有关部门代表国家行使投资决策权，这一点大家可以理解。问题出在企业投资上。由于过去不承认企业特别是全民所有制企业（以下不特别标明者均指全民所有制企业）是一个相对独立的商品生产者，一直把它作为国家机关的附属物看待，所以企业基本上没有投资决策权。这几年随着经济体制改革的推进，从理论到实际工作者在企业应拥有一定的投资决策权问题上看法已基本趋于一致，但在“一定”二字上仍有较大分歧，主要是担心企业的投资决策权大了会影响宏观经济的平衡，会产生短期行为，导致重复建设、盲目建设等。我认为这种担心没有必要。关键在于，在真正实现政企分开、使企业“断奶”的条件下，企业投资主要来自企业自身的积累和借入资金，企业自身积累直接受制于国家税收的调节，借入资金主要受制于国家金融政策的调节，这两大经济杠杆都握在国家手中。我们应着重研究如何完善宏观调节机制，强化企业自我约束力，而不是过于具体地去管企业该不该投资以及如何投资这些细节问题。随着政企分开，企业自我约束机制逐步建立，企业的投资决策权应归还给企业，这是推动企业发展和提高投资效益的重要前提。
    其次是“谁投资、谁所有”，即从所有制结构上解决责、权、利问题。我国是以社会主义公有制为主导的经济体制，过去的失误在于对“公有制”的片面理解。在投资领域，目前问题的焦点是全民所有制企业用自身积累（借入资金最终也要以企业自身积累的形式表现出来）投资形成的资产归谁所有。由于实践中不敢承认这部分资产归企业法人或企业全体职工所有，这部分资产有权参与企业利润分配和可以为全体职工带来利益，从而导致了企业重消费、轻积累的短期行为，不利于生产经营规模的扩大和生产力的发展。在对社会主义所有制关系认真思考的基础上，我认为“谁投资、谁所有”，不会因此削弱社会主义公有制基础（“企业所有制”也是公有制的一种形式），将会激发企业投资热情，高度重视投资的节约使用和经济效益的提高。
    再次是“谁投资、谁受益”，即与投资者的利益直接挂钩（投资失误带来损失可以看作是“受益”的负值，所以也包括“谁投资、谁承担风险”这一层含义）。在我国，国家投资、个人投资、外商投资以及集体企业投资与各自利益直接挂钩可以说基本上不存在问题，难点主要在全民所有制企业。目前企业投资既有决策失误而不承担风险的一面，也有企业投资带来的丰厚收益与投资决策者及全体职工利益脱钩的一面。“谁投资，谁受益”，核心是通过利益机制明确投资者的利益，强化投资者的责任，从而促成企业对提高投资效益的自我关心。这是这一模式的最大特点和优点。
    　　　　现实出路：决策科学化，健全责任制
    国家投资，指通过国家财政筹集资金所直接进行的投资。由于国家在经济生活中的特殊地位，国家投资有它自己的一些特点。首先，社会宏观效益是它追求的首要目标，这就决定了国计民生所必需的某些微利行业甚至无经济收入的一些项目和事业单位，只能由国家投资建设。其次，不少大项目和特大项目，投资大，周期长，在近期企业和银行还无力投资，而又为国家经济发展所必需，一般也要由国家投资。再次，从事国防投资、新技术风险投资和经济不发达地区的开发投资等。这些特点，是进一步探讨的重要前提条件。
    几年来，为了提高国家投资的效益，曾进行了不少有益的探索，并取得了一定成效。但由于国家投资的特点、投资主体、投资决策者和投资实施者之间难以建立起一种相互制约的经济关系，责、权、利一致的原则难以落实，仍远未达到预期的目标。作为现实出路，关键是两条：一是努力实现项目决策科学化，严格按照科学的项目管理程序办事。中心是做好项目的可行性研究，特别是国民经济评价。二是改善招投标、承包制度，健全决策和实施全过程各个环节严格的经济责任制。通过各项责任的分解和具体化，在不改变所有制形式的情况下，充分考虑到国家投资的特点和投资资金的运动规律，充分利用各种比较明晰的经济制约关系来实现责、权、利的统一，从而促进国家投资效益的提高。
    　　　　重要关键：理顺国家与企业间的经济利益关系
    在传统的社会主义经济中，国家与企业基本上是一种“父子关系”。在投资上，突出的表现是国家无偿投资和企业无偿使用。经济体制改革以来，曾努力试图改变这种格局，但总的看进展不大。深化企业改革，是我国经济体制改革的重要内容。如何强化企业投资约束，建立企业自我调节投资需求的机制，一个重要问题是逐步理顺国家与企业之间的经济利益关系。目前不仅国家预算内投资拨款改贷款（简称“拨改贷”）实施过程中国家与企业之间的产权关系模糊，企业的“税前还贷”制度更直接抵消了银行投资信贷对企业的约束力，这两个问题亟待解决。
    为此建议：第一，取消现行的“拨改贷”，实行拨款、贷款双轨制。财政拨款形成的固定资产，通过国有资产管理局，代表国家参与生产性项目国有资产利润的分配；贷款则由银行按照投资信贷原则进行管理。第二，改革企业“税前还贷”制度，明确规定投资信贷由企业用自有资金还本付息。这里有两个问题值得探讨：一是企业目前税后留利还不具备归还投资贷款本息的能力，在现行税负下实行“税后还贷”有一定困难，解决的办法是根据效益原则适当调整税负；二是应明确企业用自有资金还贷以后，这部分新增资产应记入企业资产帐户，归企业所有，由此而带来的投资利益或风险均由企业享有或承担。对于企业通过发行债券、股票筹集资金进行投资，亦应由企业税后利润还款和支付红利，所形成的资产也归企业所有。这样，可以使财产关系明确，同时由于银行与企业之间真正借贷关系的确立，加强了企业的还贷意识和银行收回贷款的责任感，也有利于抑制投资需求和促进投资效益的提高。
    　　　　主要途径：强化银行在投资调节中的作用
    随着有计划商品经济的发展，银行贷款在投资活动中的作用越来越大。１９８７年末银行固定资产投资贷款余额超过了１２００亿元，当年发放额占全民所有制单位固定资产投资的比重达到２４．６％，成了固定资产投资一条重要的资金来源渠道。强化银行在投资活动中的调节作用，是提高投资效益的一个重要方面。从现实经济考察，目前需要从以下几个方面深化改革。
    第一，完善中央银行的宏观调控机制，通过货币政策抑制过旺的投资需求，使整个投资活动在一个宽松的环境下实现良性循环和最大增殖。传统的经济体制，基本上是一种财政主导型经济。由于财政在国民收入分配与再分配中的特殊地位，财政平衡居于主导地位，财政投资的扩大与收缩直接决定着投资规模的大小。随着经济体制改革的深化和国民收入分配格局的变化，经济信用化、货币化程度大为提高，银行在国民经济中的作用逐渐加强，金融主导型经济的格局正在形成。这充分反映了有计划商品经济发展的客观必然趋势。为了在宏观上保持投资总需求与总供给的平衡，中央必须实行发展与稳定并重的宏观经济政策，坚持财政信贷综合平衡的原则，中央银行严格控制货币发行量，国家在信贷平衡的前提下安排投资信贷规模和建设债券发行规模，以便造成一个有利于投资效益提高的经济环境。
    第二，银行应有投资贷款的自主权。这个问题提了好多年，一直未能得到解决。信贷资金不同于财政资金，它主要是银行通过信用方式吸收千家万户暂时闲置的资金，是银行对客户的负债，不仅要保证归还，还要付给利息。这就决定了银行的信贷资金投放不仅要考虑期限，还要考虑盈利，实现增殖和良性循环。考虑到我国现行的体制，可从两个方面进行改革：一是压缩预算内指令性投资的范围，把一些盈利性项目下放给企业、企业集团和银行贷款去投资建设，减轻国家投资的压力；二是扩大企业投资决策权，逐步实现生产性建设项目，以国家投资为主向以企业投资为主转变，同时把银行的投资贷款权还给银行，让银行在国家计划引导的投资市场上去自主地选择项目，承担风险，独立经营，通过贷与不贷、多贷少贷、迟贷早贷和灵活的利率杠杆去调节投资需求和投资方向，并通过自身利益与投资贷款项目收益的紧密结合，去极大地促进投资效益的提高。
    第三，充分发挥投资贷款利率的调节作用。随着我国经济由直接控制为主转向间接控制为主的改革，投资活动中贷款利率的杠杆调节作用将越来越大。认真研究和确定我国投资贷款利率体系和利率的杠杆作用，应是一个十分重要的问题。合理的投资贷款利率体系，不仅要体现一个时期国家的产业政策和金融政策，而且还可以利用行业差别利率，限制长线，促进短线，以促进国民经济结构沿着合理方向发展。同时还要充分考虑反映资金的时间价值，彻底改变目前长、短期贷款利率不合理的状况。对国家特别扶持的贷款，应实行财政贴息。要实行浮动利率政策，通过利率的升降来调节投资的需求和供给。在我国企业投资需求过大的情况下，通过投资贷款利率进行调节和控制，必将收到比行政手段更显著的效果。
