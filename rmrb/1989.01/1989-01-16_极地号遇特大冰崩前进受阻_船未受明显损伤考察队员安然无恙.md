The Polar Star encountered a major ice collapse and its progress was hindered. The ship did not suffer any noticeable damage, and all 116 members of the expedition team are safe.

Xinhua News Agency, Larsemann Hills, January 15th - The Polar Star anchored yesterday afternoon after breaking through the ice, reaching a point about 400 meters from the Larsemann Hills shore. At 1:35 AM today (all times are Beijing time), an ice collapse occurred near the port side. Ice blocks rolled down like a mudslide. The ice situation has now stabilized, and no significant damage to the Polar Star has been found. All 116 members of the expedition team are safe.

The ship anchored at 8:20 PM on the 14th and had lowered a barge to prepare for unloading materials for the base. This is also the place where Soviet expedition ships have frequently anchored to unload materials for the Progress Station. The ice cover is on the port side of the Polar Star, about 1,800 meters away. The ice cover has deep V-shaped cracks several tens of meters deep, and the outer edge of the ice cliff is severely tilted.

The ice collapse was terrifying. First, there was a loud roar, and a cloud of snow and broken ice rose into the air. The collapsed ice cover pushed forward, creating a scene of mountains tumbling into the sea, and waves as high as 10 meters. At the front edge of the collapsed ice cover, some ice blocks the size of trucks suddenly plunged into the seabed, then floated back up with great force, stirring the sea water.

The crew of the Polar Star recorded and calculated the ice collapse situation. This ice collapse occurred three times in succession. The ice cover that did not collapse is also moving at a speed of 7 to 10 meters per minute. The collapsed ice extends about 5 kilometers into the sea behind the ship, covering an area of about 10 square kilometers. Fortunately, the Polar Star's anchoring point is close to the shore, avoiding a major disaster. It is said that such a large-scale ice collapse is rare in the Antarctic region.

When the ice cover first collapsed, the falling ice mountain blocked the ship's retreat path, and there was a cliff in front of the ship. As the ice mountain on the port side collapsed and pushed towards the ship, the starboard side was the land, leaving the ship only about 500 square meters of floating ice area to maneuver. Later, due to the floating ice pressing in from all sides, the expedition ship became completely immobilized.

Commander Chen Dehong, Team Leader Guo Kun, and Captain Wei Wenliang all agreed that it was fortunate that the ice cover did not collapse when the expedition ship passed by. Otherwise, the ship would have been crushed underneath. Chen Dehong said that since the ship is very close to the shore, the safety of the expedition team is guaranteed.

### 极地号遇特大冰崩前进受阻  船未受明显损伤考察队员安然无恙

　　极地号遇特大冰崩前进受阻
    船未受明显损伤考察队员安然无恙
    新华社拉斯曼丘陵１月１５日电  （记者张继民）“极地”号船昨日下午履冰前进，挺进到距拉斯曼丘陵陆岸４００多米的地方抛锚。今日北京时间凌晨１时３５分以后（以下均为北京时间）左舷附近出现冰崩，冰块像泥石流一样滚滚而来。现冰情略为稳定，暂未发现“极地”号受到明显损伤，１１６名考察队员安然无恙。
    这艘考察船是１４日２０时２０分抛锚的，已放下驳船准备卸运建站物资。这里也是苏联考察船多次抛锚向进步站卸运物资的地方。冰盖在船左舷，距“极地”号约１８００米。冰盖上面有一道道深达几十米的Ｖ形裂隙，外缘冰崖已严重倾斜。
    冰山崩塌时惊心动魄。先是轰然一声巨响，白雪与碎冰组成的烟腾空而起。塌下的冰盖后面推着前面，排山倒海向海中翻滚，掀起１０余米高的水柱。在塌下的冰盖前沿，一些如卡车大小的冰块，猛地扎进海底，又以巨大的力量浮上海面，搅得海水哗哗作响。
    “极地”号船驾驶人员对冰盖冰崩情况作了记录和计算。这次冰崩共连续发生三次。没有崩塌的冰盖，也在以每分钟７至１０米的速度移动。冰山倒塌部分向船后海中延伸约５公里，散布范围约１０平方公里。由于“极地”号抛锚点靠近陆地，才未酿成大祸。据介绍，在南极地区，冰盖如此大规模的崩塌比较少见。
    冰盖第一次崩塌时，倒下的冰山把考察船退路堵死，船前方又是石崖，随着船左舷崩塌冰山向船挤来，右舷又是陆地，它开始只能在５００平方米浮冰海域机动。后来又因浮冰在船四周挤压，终使考察船寸步难行。
    陈德鸿总指挥、郭琨队长、魏文良船长等都认为，幸亏考察船在从冰盖附近经过时没有崩塌，否则，船会被压在下面。陈德鸿说，由于船距陆岸很近，考察队员的安全是有保障的。
