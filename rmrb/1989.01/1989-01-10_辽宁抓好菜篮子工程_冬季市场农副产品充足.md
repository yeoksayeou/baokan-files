The Liaoning provincial government, in light of the province's industrial focus and high urban population ratio, has prioritized the "basket of vegetables" project as a key initiative to promote social stability and economic development. From the provincial governor down to mayors, county magistrates, and district chiefs, all have included the management of the "basket of vegetables" in their work agendas. Since winter, Liaoning's major cities have seen ample supplies of pork, beef, mutton, eggs, poultry, and aquatic products, with a variety of vegetables available at reasonable prices.

The main measures taken by Liaoning province to ensure the "basket of vegetables" project include:

	— Starting with the construction of bases and intensive management, developing livestock and poultry farming with a focus on pig farming. The province has established 52 commercial pig and freshwater fish bases. In Shenyang alone, there are 5,200 households raising 30 or more pigs.

	— Actively developing freshwater aquaculture. Over the past eight years, freshwater fish production has increased by an average of 27% annually. Meanwhile, marine product production has achieved a rational structure through both aquaculture and fishing.

	— Accelerating the construction of winter greenhouses. The province has 220,000 mu (approximately 14,667 hectares) of vegetable protected cultivation areas and has repaired and built over 400,000 square meters of various vegetable storage facilities and constant temperature warehouses.

	— Using economic measures to guide vegetable farmers. Establishing a reserve fund for adjusting the supply and demand of vegetables, and through increasing the purchase price of early-season vegetables, stabilizing mid-season prices, and protecting late-season prices, encouraging farmers to advance the harvest and delay the planting, thereby balancing the market supply of vegetables.

　　辽宁抓好菜篮子工程
    冬季市场农副产品充足
    本报讯  本报记者刘晓林、经济日报记者张子臣报道：辽宁省政府针对本省以工业为主和城市人口比例大的特点，把“菜篮子”工程当做促进社会安定团结和经济发展的大事，从省长到市长、县长、区长都把抓“菜篮子”列入自己的工作日程。入冬以来，辽宁大中城市市场猪牛羊肉和蛋禽及水产品充足，各种蔬菜品种多、价格适宜。
    辽宁省抓好菜篮子工程的主要措施有：
    ——从抓基地建设和集约化经营入手，发展以养猪为主的畜禽饲养业。全省建设商品猪、淡水鱼基地５２个，仅沈阳市养猪３０头以上的大户就有５２００家。
    ——大力开发淡水养鱼。８年来淡水鱼产量平均每年以２７％的速度递增。同时，海产品生产实现了养殖与捕捞并举的合理结构。
    ——抓紧冬季大棚建设。全省蔬菜保护地已达２２万亩，还维修、新建各种菜窖、恒温库４０多万平方米。
    ——用经济手段引导菜农。设立调剂蔬菜产销淡旺季储备基金，对定购的蔬菜，通过提高前期菜的收购价，稳定中期价、保护后期价，促进农民提早推晚、均衡排开蔬菜上市时间。
