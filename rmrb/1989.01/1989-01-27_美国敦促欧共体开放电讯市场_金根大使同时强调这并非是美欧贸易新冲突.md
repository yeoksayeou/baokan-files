The United States Urges the EEC to Open the Telecommunications Market

Ambassador Alfred Goldmark Emphasizes This Is Not a New Trade Conflict Between the U.S. and Europe

Our reporter Wei Wei reports from Brussels on January 26: On the 25th, Alfred Goldmark, the head of the U.S. mission to the EEC, stated that the United States will exert pressure on the EEC to urge Europeans to open their market to U.S. telecommunications companies. The EEC spokesman issued a statement on the same day expressing "deep concern" over the U.S.'s intention.

The U.S. ambassador pointed out that, in accordance with the implementation of the "Comprehensive Trade Act," the United States intends to negotiate with the "major players" in the global telecommunications market based on the principle of "reciprocity." The EEC member states and South Korea have been selected as "favored countries," with the hope that they will open their markets in this field, ensuring that U.S. products and services are not subject to "discriminatory policies." He further stated that within the next month, the Bush administration will formally report this to Congress and then begin negotiations.

However, the ambassador emphasized that this move does not mean a "new trade conflict between the U.S. and Europe." "We will have a year to strive for an agreement through negotiations. Moreover, the president can extend the negotiation period." Even if the negotiations fail, Washington has not yet considered taking retaliatory measures.

However, the Brussels media believes that after the EEC achieves a "unified market" in 1992, the telecommunications sector will enjoy full freedom in the markets of the 12 member states. The United States is obviously concerned that at that time, its products and services will be squeezed out of the EEC market, and has taken this new approach as a precaution.

Currently, the EEC is preparing to make a further statement after obtaining a clear explanation of the U.S.'s "threatening" steps.

According to statistics from the EEC Commission, the global trade volume of telecommunications equipment is $90 billion. The United States accounts for 38%, and the EEC accounts for 19%. In the telecommunications industry trade between the U.S. and Europe, the United States had a surplus of $600 million last year, which is favorable to the United States.

　　美国敦促欧共体开放电讯市场    
    金根大使同时强调这并非是美欧贸易新冲突
    本报布鲁塞尔１月２６日电  记者魏崴报道：２５日，美国驻欧共体使团团长阿尔弗雷德·金根大使表示，美国将对欧共体施加压力，敦促欧洲人向美国电讯公司开放市场。欧共体发言人于同日已在一声明中对美国这一意向“深表不安”。
    美国大使指出，由于执行《综合贸易法》，美国打算与世界电讯市场的“主要营业者”展开以“对等”原则为基础的谈判，并且已选定欧共体诸成员国和南朝鲜为自己的“优惠国家”，期望它们在这个领域内开放市场，使美国的有关产品和劳务不致受到“歧视性政策”的限制。他还进一步表示，在最近一个月以内，布什政府将正式就此通报国会，然后谈判。
    但这位大使强调，美国此举并不意味着是“美欧贸易的新冲突”。“我们将有一年的时间争取谈判达成协议。况且，总统还可以延长谈判时间”。即使谈判告吹，华盛顿也尚未考虑采取报复。
    然而，布鲁塞尔的舆论界认为，欧共体于１９９２年“统一大市场”实现后，电讯部门将在１２个成员国市场上享有充分自由。美国显然是担心到了那时，自己的产品和劳务在欧共体市场上受到排挤，才未雨绸缪，出此新招。
    眼下，欧共体准备对美国的这一“威胁性”步骤得到明确解释后，再进一步表态。
    据欧共体委员会统计，世界电讯设备贸易额达９００亿美元。美国占３８％，欧共体占１９％。欧美电讯业贸易中，美国去年盈余６亿美元，对美国有利。
