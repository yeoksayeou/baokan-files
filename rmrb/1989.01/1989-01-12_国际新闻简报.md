International News Brief

	Alfafat Meets with Greek Prime Minister

	Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat met with Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou on the evening of the 10th. During the meeting, Arafat called on Europe and the European Community to play a more active role in promoting a peaceful resolution to the Middle East conflict.

	In a statement issued after the meeting, Papandreou reiterated that the Greek government supports the PLO's struggle for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.

	Italian and Japanese Foreign Ministers Hold Talks

	Italian Foreign Minister Gianni De Michelis, during his meeting with Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata on the 10th, emphasized that the European single market under construction is not of a "fortress" nature.

	De Michelis said that the establishment of a unified European market should not be interpreted as a means to develop one's own wealth at the expense of friendly countries.

	Italy-Japan trade has increased in recent years, but it only accounts for one-tenth of Japan's total trade with the European Community (550 billion dollars), indicating that there is still great potential for trade between the two countries.

	According to a report by the Hungarian News Agency on the 10th, Zerkov met with Israeli Labor Party Chairman Shimon Peres and held talks with members of the Israeli Communist Party Political Bureau.

	Zerkov visited Israel as a Hungarian party official.

	According to a report by the Hungarian People's Free Press on the 10th, Hungarian Minister of Agriculture and Food Industry Vanczo, who is visiting Israel, signed an agricultural cooperation agreement with Israeli Minister of Agriculture on the 9th. The report quoted a Jerusalem radio station as saying that both ministers expressed that "Hungary and Israel can expect to restore diplomatic relations in the coming months."
