The "historic event" of the Vienna follow-up meeting of the CSCE, after more than two years of arduous negotiations, concluded on January 19 in Vienna. The final document of the meeting is 53 pages long (in German), which is one-third longer than the combined documents of the previous two meetings. The meeting changed the previous emphasis on security, making security, arms control, economic cooperation, and humanitarian issues the "three baskets" roughly equal in importance, and achieved some "surprising" progress.

In the areas of security and arms control, the meeting authorized the 23 member countries of the Warsaw Pact and NATO to hold European conventional arms talks in Vienna in March this year, replacing the 15-year-old and stagnant negotiations on conventional forces in Europe. This is the first time that direct arms control talks have been held within the framework of the CSCE.

It is reported that in order to facilitate the European conventional arms talks, the United States and France compromised on the issue of whether neutral and non-aligned countries should directly participate in the talks, bridging their differences. On the issue of whether Mersin in southern Turkey should be included in the arms control scope, to ease the dispute between Greece and Turkey, the Soviet Union provided active assistance to the West. This shows that all parties are willing to use the strong momentum of arms control and détente that has emerged in the past year to take new steps in conventional arms control. However, on the other hand, conventional arms control involves the vital interests of all parties and has the most complex issues among various arms control talks, so its progress will inevitably be fraught with difficulties.

In the humanitarian field, the meeting's achievements "far exceeded expectations," as a Western journalist put it, "many milestones have been set." The key points are: first, the participating countries acknowledge that respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms is the fundamental factor for peace, justice, and security, and for the first time express that they will make their respective laws, regulations, and policies consistent with international law and CSCE obligations. Second, the meeting document for the first time stipulates that the rights of individuals or groups to protect human rights should be respected. Third, the final document provides detailed regulations on the rights and handling of personal migration, border crossing, etc. At the meeting, the Soviet Union and some Eastern European countries took a pragmatic stance on human rights issues. This is a reflection of Gorbachev's "new thinking" in diplomacy on human rights issues.

In the economic and other fields, the meeting highlighted the significance of establishing joint ventures and strengthening environmental protection cooperation. The meeting document stipulates that legal, administrative, and financial conditions should be improved for the establishment of joint ventures, and information exchange should be strengthened, including management, working conditions, financial systems, taxation, profit repatriation, investment protection, domestic market raw material supply, and sales possibilities.

From this, it is not difficult to see the strong desire of the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries to introduce funds and technology from Western Europe. Western Europe also has the need to develop the Eastern European market. However, it is precisely in the economic and technological fields that this meeting did not achieve much. According to relevant officials, this is because the United States is concerned that once the door is opened, the COCOM embargo list will become a mere piece of paper. This also reflects, to some extent, that the United States is still uncertain about Soviet reforms and does not dare to act rashly.

The meeting concluded amid a chorus of praise, but as one commentator pointed out, the meeting document is merely the "house rules" for the future European house. How the "residents" will understand, interpret, and abide by these "rules" can only be verified by future history.

### “欧洲大厦”的“住户守则”

　　“欧洲大厦”的“住户守则”
    方祥生
    被视为“历史性事件”的欧安会维也纳续会，经过两年多的艰苦谈判，已于一月十九日在维也纳结束。会议通过的最后文件长达五十三页（德文本），比前两次会议文件的总和还长三分之一。会议改变了前两次会议侧重安全的倾向，使安全与裁军、经济合作、人道主义这“三个篮子”大致并重，并取得了若干“令人吃惊”的进展。
    在安全与裁军方面，会议授权华约和北约的二十三个成员国于今年三月在维也纳举行欧洲常规军备谈判，以取代进行了十五年而无进展的中欧裁军谈判。在欧安会范围内直接进行裁军谈判，这在欧安会历史上还是首次。
    据透露，为了使欧洲常规军备谈判得以进行，美国和法国在是否让中立国和不结盟国家直接参加谈判这一问题上相互妥协，弥合了分歧。在土耳其南部的梅尔辛是否应纳入裁军范围这个问题上，为平息希腊同土耳其之间的争论，苏联向西方提供了积极协助。这表明，各方都愿利用近一年来出现的强劲的裁军和缓和势头，在常规裁军的道路上迈出新的步伐。但另一方面，常规裁军涉及各方的切身利益，在各类裁军谈判中头绪最多，因此，其进程必将是困难重重的。
    在人道主义领域，会议取得的成果“远远超出了期望”，用西方记者的话说，即“竖起了许多里程碑”。其要点为：一、与会国承认，尊重人权和基本自由是和平、正义与安全的根本因素，并首次表示，将使各自的法律、法令及政策与国际法及欧安会义务相一致。二、会议文件首次规定，要尊重个人或团体维护人权的权力。三、最后文件，对个人迁徙，出入国境等权利和处理方式做了详细规定。会上，苏联及东欧一些国家对人权问题采取了务实的立场。这是戈尔巴乔夫外交“新思维”在人权问题上的反映。
    在经济和其它领域，会议突出了建立合资企业和加强环境保护合作的意义。会议文件规定，要为建立合资企业改善法律、行政和资金方面的条件，加强包括经营、工作条件、财务制度、税收、利润换汇、投资保护、本国市场原料供应及销售可能等的信息交流。
    从中不难看出苏联和东欧国家想从西欧引进资金和技术的强烈愿望。西欧也有开拓东欧市场的需要。然而，恰恰在经济和科技领域，此次会议并没有大的建树。据有关人士透露，这是因为美国担心口子一旦打开，巴统的禁运单就会变成一纸空文。这也从一个侧面反映了美国对苏联的改革仍心中无数，未敢贸然。
    会议已在一片赞扬声中闭幕，但正如此间评论员指出的那样，会议文件只不过是未来欧洲大厦的“住户守则”，其中的“住户”将怎样理解、解释和遵守这一“守则”，这只能由未来的历史来验证。
