The former site of the CCP Central North Bureau in Wangjiayu, Wuxiang County, Shanxi Province, has recently opened to the public. Many old comrades from the North Bureau have donated historical artifacts and documents, and Chairman Yang Shangkun has inscribed a plaque for the site.

The CCP Central North Bureau was a dispatch agency of the Party Central Committee during the War of Resistance Against Japan. Liu Shaoqi, Yang Shangkun, Peng Dehuai, and Deng Xiaoping successively served as the bureau's secretary.

The former site of the CCP Central North Bureau has utilized its ancillary buildings to establish an auxiliary exhibition hall titled "The CCP Central North Bureau During the War of Resistance Against Japan." The exhibition hall, using precious historical photographs and revolutionary artifacts, recreates the North Bureau's leadership in the local party in North China, its coordination with the Eighth Route Army Headquarters and the 129th Division, and its steadfast implementation of the Party's policy of expanding and consolidating the base areas. It highlights the great revolutionary practice and immortal historical achievements of opening up and establishing the North China Anti-Japanese Base Areas.

    本报讯  位于山西省武乡县王家峪的中共中央北方局旧址，近期已对外开放。原北方局的许多老同志捐赠了文物资料，杨尚昆主席为旧址题写了门匾。
    中共中央北方局是抗日战争时期党中央的派出机关。刘少奇、杨尚昆、彭德怀、邓小平曾先后任北方局书记。
    中共中央北方局旧址利用附属建筑，举办了《抗日战争时期的中共中央北方局》辅助陈列馆。陈列馆以珍贵的历史照片和革命文物，再现了北方局在此领导华北地方党，配合八路军总部和一二九师，坚定地执行党的放手发展与深入巩固的方针，开辟与创建华北抗日根据地的伟大革命实践和不朽的历史功绩。 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（王照骞）
