The National Committee on U.S.-China Relations recently published a report, suggesting that the incoming U.S. administration should place greater emphasis on strengthening U.S.-China economic relations to enhance America's position in China and safeguard the strategic benefits derived from the improvement of bilateral relations.

The report, titled "U.S.-China Economic Relations After the Reagan Era," emphasizes that the developing economic ties between the two countries will make their relations "more stable and enduring."

The report notes that although the international environment has changed, "there still exist common strategic interests between the U.S. and China, the most notable of which is in maintaining regional security." The report believes that "both sides need to further expand the foundation of bilateral relations to maintain and deepen the relationship between the two countries."

The report states that China has risen to become an economic and trading powerhouse, with trade volume increasing from $15 billion before economic reforms a decade ago to $100 billion.

The report predicts that although China is still poor in terms of per capita income, its population of over 1 billion and rapid economic growth give it the potential to become a world power by the early 21st century.

The report points out that if the U.S. wants to compete with Japan, Western Europe, and South Korea in providing key technologies, equipment, and funds to the Chinese market, the most fundamental step is to place greater emphasis on economic relations with China.

The report suggests the following policies for the U.S.:

	— Develop a mixed loan program to provide funds for U.S. exporters competing with other major industrialized countries in trade with China;
	— Expand technological assistance to China in areas with high commercial potential, allocating funds for feasibility studies and technical training for projects that may lead to increased Chinese exports to the U.S.;
	— Provide an appropriate amount of budget funds specifically for selected U.S.-China science and technology cooperation projects;
	— Further relax export restrictions on civilian technologies with potential military applications, particularly "dual-use" technologies that China can obtain from third countries;
	— The U.S. should make active efforts to ensure that China's entry into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade will guarantee mutual market access.

　　美中关系全国委员会公布一份报告
    建议下届美国政府更加重视美中关系
    新华社纽约１月１３日电  （记者钱文荣）美中关系全国委员会最近公布一份报告，建议即将接任的下届美国政府更加重视加强美中经济关系，以提高美国在中国的地位和维护由两国关系改善带来的战略利益。
    这份题为《里根时代后的对华经济关系》的报告强调，正在发展中的美中经济联系将使两国关系“更加稳定和持久”。
    报告指出，虽然国际环境已经发生了变化，“但美中之间依然存在着共同的战略利益，其中最值得注意的是在维护地区安全方面。”报告认为，“双方都需要进一步拓展双边关系的基础，以维护和加深两国的关系。”
    报告说，中国已经崛起成为一个经济和贸易大国，贸易额从１０年前经济改革前的１５０亿美元增加到１０００亿美元。
    报告预测，虽然中国目前就人均收入而言还很穷，但其１０亿多人口和经济迅速增长使它具有在２１世纪初成为世界强国的潜力。
    报告指出，如果美国想在向中国市场提供关键技术、设备和资金方面与日本、西欧和南朝鲜竞争，最基本的是要更加明确地重视对华经济关系。
    报告建议美国采取下列政策：
    ——制定一项混合贷款计划，向与其他主要工业国家竞争对华贸易的美国出口商提供资金；
    ——在具有高度商业潜力的领域内扩大对华技术援助，为可能导致扩大中国对美出口的项目增拨可行性研究和技术培训资金；
    ——提供适当数量的预算资金，专项用于经过挑选的美中科技合作适目；
    进一步放宽具有潜在军事实用价值的民用技术的出口限制，尤其是那些中国可以从第三国获取的“两用”技术；
    ——美国作出积极努力，保证中国加入贸易和关税总协定将确保双方进入对方市场。
