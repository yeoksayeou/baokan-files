	Gorbachev, the leader of the Soviet Union, stated that the Soviet Union is a one-party state, a historical fact. In political terms, no one can replace the party. In an era of openness and democratization, the party remains a powerful ideological and political force.

	Today, TASS released the full text of Gorbachev's speech on January 21 at the Moscow City Party Congress.

	In response to suggestions that the Soviet Union should adopt a multi-party system, Gorbachev pointed out that even if these individuals genuinely hope for rapid development of the country, they are correct only in their desire to establish a supervisory system. He said that the party is striving to establish a supervisory system through political reforms, democracy, and criticism.

	Regarding the current tight supply situation in the market, Gorbachev explained that the problem lies in the excessive circulation of currency, which is disconnected from goods, leading people to hoard even unnecessary items, causing market chaos. Some dishonest individuals hoard goods to sell at high prices in the black market. He said that some have suggested borrowing money to purchase consumer goods, which was done during the time of the "oil" dollars in the Soviet Union, but such irresponsible policies will not be adopted in the future. Instead, the primary focus should be on increasing production to meet market demand.

	Gorbachev urged people not to expect everything to change overnight. He said that changing the current economic structure of the Soviet Union is not an easy task. He emphasized that the reforms in the Soviet Union have just begun and have not yet reached the desired level.

	Gorbachev revealed that the Soviet Union is drafting a promising agricultural policy, which will be discussed at the Central Committee meeting in March. Another Central Committee meeting will be held in April to discuss the prospects for societal development. This issue will also be addressed at the upcoming first session of the People's Congress.

　　戈尔巴乔夫强调苏联是一党制国家    
    党将通过政治改革等手段建立监督制度
    新华社莫斯科１月２３日电  苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫说，苏联是一党制国家，这是历史上形成的。在政治上，谁也代替不了党，在实行公开性和民主化的今天，党是一支强大的思想政治力量。
    塔斯社今天全文播发了戈尔巴乔夫２１日在莫斯科市党代会上的讲话。
    针对有人提出苏联需要实行多党制的主张，戈尔巴乔夫指出，这些人即使真正希望国家得到迅速发展，也只能说在希望建立一种监督制度方面是正确的。他说，党正在力求通过政治改革、民主和批评等手段来建立监督制度。
    在谈到目前市场供应紧张情况时，戈尔巴乔夫解释说，问题在于货币流通量过大，与商品脱节，致使人人都想储存哪怕是不需要的商品，造成市场失控。有些不诚实的人则囤积商品，到黑市高价倒卖。他说，有人建议借外债购买消费品，在苏联拥有“石油”美元时曾这样做过，但今后不会再采取这种不负责任的政策了。应首先靠增产满足市场需求。
    戈尔巴乔夫要求人们不要希望一朝一夕就能改变一切。他说，要改变当前苏联的经济结构，并非是轻而易举的事。他强调，苏联的改革还只是刚刚展开，尚未达到应有水平。
    戈尔巴乔夫透露，苏联正在拟定一项有前途的农业政策，供定于３月举行的中央全会讨论。４月将召开另一次中央全会，讨论社会的发展前景。在将要召开的第一次人民代表大会上也将涉及这个问题。
