Soviet First Deputy Foreign Minister, Ambassador to Kabul, Vorontsov arrives in Islamabad
Holds talks with Pakistani Foreign Minister on Soviet-Pakistani relations and the Afghanistan issue

	Islamabad, January 4 (Reported by Ren Yujun): Soviet First Deputy Foreign Minister, Ambassador to Kabul, Vorontsov arrived here today. He held talks with Pakistani Foreign Minister Jacob Khan on bilateral relations between the Soviet Union and Pakistan and the Afghanistan issue.

	The Soviet delegation, led by Vorontsov and consisting of seven members, is the first high-level Soviet official delegation received by the newly elected government of Pakistan. It is reported that Vorontsov brought a letter from Gorbachev to Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. Today, Vorontsov and Jacob Khan held their first round of talks on the relationship and economic and trade situation between the two countries, as well as the Afghanistan issue. On January 5, Vorontsov will meet with the new President Ghulam Ishaq Khan and further discuss the above issues. Vorontsov will also hold talks with Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto during his stay in Pakistan. It is believed that the purpose of Vorontsov's visit is to improve Soviet-Pakistani relations and persuade the new Pakistani government to adopt a cooperative attitude in resolving the Afghanistan issue, so that the Soviet Union can withdraw its troops in the final stage with dignity and establish a government in Afghanistan that is also acceptable to the Soviet side.

	Another important activity Vorontsov will undertake in Islamabad is the second round of negotiations with the Seven-Party Alliance of Afghan Resistance Forces.

	The newly appointed chairman of the Seven-Party Alliance of Afghan Resistance Forces, Mujaddidi, will negotiate with Vorontsov. Yesterday, at a press conference held in Peshawar, he said that the main topics of the talks would be the complete withdrawal of Soviet troops by the deadline and the end of the rule of the Kabul regime to establish a broad-based government. He stated that the resistance forces firmly do not recognize the Kabul regime and will establish an independent Islamic government in Afghanistan, which will include some "well-behaved Muslims" from the Kabul government as members. He also said that in the short term, a provisional parliament composed of resistance forces, field commanders, refugees, ethnic leaders, intellectuals, and exiles will supervise the Soviet withdrawal and the formation of a broad-based government.

　　苏第一副外长沃龙佐夫抵伊斯兰堡
    同巴外长就苏巴关系和阿富汗问题会谈
    本报伊斯兰堡１月４日电  记者任毓骏报道：苏联第一副外长、驻喀布尔大使沃龙佐夫今天飞抵这里，同巴基斯坦外长雅各布·汗就苏巴双边关系和阿富汗问题举行了会谈。
    以沃龙佐夫为首的７人苏联代表团是巴基斯坦新的民选政府产生后接待的第一个苏联高级官方代表团。有消息说，沃龙佐夫带来了戈尔巴乔夫写给贝·布托总理的信件。今天，沃龙佐夫和雅各布·汗首先就巴苏关系和经贸状况以及阿富汗问题举行了首次会谈。１月５日，沃龙佐夫将拜会新总统伊沙克·汗并进一步商谈上述问题。沃龙佐夫在巴期间还将同贝·布托总理举行会谈。据信，沃龙佐夫此行的目的是改善苏巴关系并说服巴基斯坦新政府在解决阿富汗问题上采取合作态度，以期苏联能在最后阶段体面撤军并在阿富汗建立一个苏方也能接受的政府。
    沃龙佐夫在伊斯兰堡的另一重要活动是与阿富汗抵抗组织七党联盟举行第２轮谈判。
    新任阿富汗抵抗力量七党联盟主席的穆贾迪迪将出面与沃龙佐夫谈判。昨天，他在白沙瓦举行的记者招待会上说，苏联如期全部撤军和结束喀布尔政权的统治并建立基础广泛的政府等问题将是会谈的主要内容。他表示，抵抗力量坚决不承认喀布尔政权，并将在阿富汗建立一个独立自主的伊斯兰政府，这个政府将吸收喀布尔政府中一些“表现好的穆斯林”作为政府成员。他还说，在短期内，一个由抵抗力量、战地游击队司令、难民、种族领袖、知识分子和流亡在外国的人士所组成的临时议会将监督苏联撤军和组建基础广泛的政府。
