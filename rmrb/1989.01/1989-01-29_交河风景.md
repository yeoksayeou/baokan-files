The Scenery of Jiahe

I had originally thought that the dimly lit ancient city would never disturb the emotions of tourists. I had thought that these abandoned temples and pagoda forests would no longer be places of prayer. They should stand quietly in the wilderness, washing away all the waves of the mundane world.

But it is not so. A Japanese woman with a high bun, accompanied by a Uyghur female guide, came to pay homage to the temple in the ancient city of Jiahe. The woman had delicate features and eyes that were full of charm. She wore a light yellow kimono, with makeup that was both heavy and light, like a cherry blossom hanging down, as if she had condensed all the spring colors of Mount Fuji into her appearance. Her mind was calm, and her steps were very slow, very light, very light. Then came a small leap, as if she had crossed a century of storms...

What was she afraid of disturbing? She probably spent half an hour walking along the central avenue of the ancient city towards the temple ruins in the north. From afar, she began to bow in worship. The closer she got, the more solemn her expression became.

She must have read the Japanese writer Inoue Yasushi's novel "Turfan" or his essay "The Silk Road," and been captivated by an irresistible charm, traveling thousands of miles to come here. Inoue Yasushi wrote: "Drinking wine, singing such songs: 'In ancient times, this place was an ocean, the devil-like sea fled, and it became a beautiful desert'... Under the moonlight, the song echoing around the desert was both beautiful and sad..." But she seemed not very interested in the "beautiful desert," the mirage, or the illusory lake. She was devoutly paying homage to the temple that had been abandoned for hundreds of years. She came to the ruins of the temple wall, searching for something, and stood on a broken high platform. She carefully took out an incense stick, lit the smoke, and the smoke curled up. She closed her eyes slightly, slowly knelt down, and lightly touched her forehead to the yellow earth. When she raised her head, two rows of tears flowed down. Was she whispering a prayer for her ancestors who had passed away a thousand years ago, or was she blessing the uncertain fate of those to come?

The twilight had passed, and the autumn moon rose slowly from the gaps in the pagoda forest. Her charming eyes were as bright as the moonlight. Perhaps she was singing the "waka" of the Japanese "moon poet" Myoe in her heart! Her thoughts were long, pondering the subtle resonance between the heart and the moon in religion and philosophy. Perhaps, more than that, she was savoring the thick wine of history in the vast sky, from Homer to Plato, to the blind saint Ganjin crossing to Japan...

I quietly asked the Uyghur guide. She said that this Japanese woman had come to the ancient city of Jiahe for the third time, in 1984, 1985, and now again. Each time she paid homage, she would bathe and change into a kimono, with two rows of tears, as if there was some sadness or grief winding around her heart. Sometimes she would look up at the sky, sometimes she would gaze at the desert mist, as if she did not know of her own existence in the vast world. The guide understood Japanese, so every time the Japanese woman came to the ancient city, she was accompanied by her. Asked if her ancestors had been merchants on the Silk Road or western travelers and explorers, the Japanese woman only shook her head, not revealing her heart and background.

The night wind was howling, gradually roaring. A crow flew over the top of the pagoda. The wind in the wilderness became more rampant, as if it wanted to blow down the cold moon and let it shatter in the desert.

The Japanese woman's heart was as still as water, listening to the wind's call. Her Buddhist heart was moved, resonating with the ancient teaching of Ikkyu, "Entering the Buddhist realm is easy, entering the demon realm is difficult." Perhaps she could not enter the "demon realm," so she sought the protection of the gods. But without the "demon realm," there would be no "Buddhist realm." It is the "demon realm" that creates the "Buddhist realm."

Was this Japanese woman trying to meditate for ten years to break through the wall and enter the hall of the "demon realm"?

　　交河风景
    杨羽仪
    我原以为微暗的故城永远不会扰乱游人的感情，原以为这废弃的寺院和塔林再没人来祈祷了。它们应该宁静地伫立在旷野上，把世俗的波涛冲得一干二净。
    其实不然。一位日本高髻少妇在维吾尔族导游姑娘的陪同下，来禅拜交河故城的寺院。少妇眉目清秀，眼睛楚楚动人，穿一身米黄色的和服，浓装淡抹，像一枝垂挂着的樱花，仿佛把富士山的春色都凝聚于她的一身。她心境凝静，步履放得很慢很慢，轻轻的，轻轻的，随后是一次小小的跨越，却像跨越了一个世纪的风云……她怕惊动什么呢？她大约花了半个小时，沿着故城中央的大街通衢，向城北的寺院遗址走去。远远的就顶礼膜拜起来。越近，神情越加庄重。
    她是在看了日本作家井上靖的长篇《楼兰》，或是看了他的散文《丝绸之路》之后，被一种难以抵挡的魅力所迷，迢迢万里而来的吧？井上靖在文中写道：“喝着酒，唱着这样的歌：‘太古的时候，这里曾经是海洋，魔鬼般的海逃走了，这里变成了美丽的大沙漠’……月夜，回荡在沙漠四周的歌声既艳美又哀伤……”但她似乎对于“美丽的沙漠”，对于海市蜃楼，对于迷幻的湖不怎么感兴趣，她是虔诚地来禅拜这废弃了几百年的寺院的。她来到寺院断墙边，寻觅着什么，走到一处残缺的高台上伫立着，珍重地取出香柱，点燃烟火，余烟袅袅。她双手合十，微微闭上眼睛，缓缓地下跪，前额轻轻叩着黄土地。待她抬起头来，两行清泪潸然而下。似在絮语，是为已故千载的祖先祈祷，还是为来者未卜的命运祝福？
    黄昏已逝，秋月从塔林空隙徐徐升起。她那楚楚动人的眼睛也如月华一样明洁。也许，她心中唱着日本“月亮诗人”明惠写的“和歌”吧！她的思绪悠长，是思索着宗教、哲学的心与月亮之间微妙的呼应么？也许，更多的是在茫茫的天际间，品味着历史的浓酒，从荷马问世，从柏拉图问世，以至盲圣鉴真东渡日本……她也许是在日本招提寺的鉴真全身塑像上，看见失明的双目浮映着微微的泪影，泪光中藏着为了渡海而忍受十一载苦难的不屈精神，那一颗炽热的求道之心啊！而今，她是为景仰鉴真的宏志而西渡中国么？
    我悄悄问维吾尔族导游姑娘。她说，这位东瀛女子已是第三次来交河故城了，１９８４年、１９８５年来过，而今又来了。每次禅拜，都沐浴更衣，一身和服，两行清泪，似有什么悲伤或哀怨曲曲折折绕在心头。她有时望望苍穹，有时凝视大漠风烟，茫茫天地间不知有自己的存在。导游姑娘懂日文，所以，那位东瀛女子来故城，都是由她作陪。问她的祖先是否曾是丝路上的商旅？是否西行的旅行家、探险家？那东瀛女子只顾摇头，不透露自己的心迹和身世。
    夜风在低鸣、呼啸，渐渐咆哮起来了。一只寒鸦从塔顶掠过。旷野上的风更肆虐了，好像要把寒月吹落，让它在大漠中摔得粉碎。
    东瀛女子心静如水，听着风的呼唤，她的佛心被撼动了，应和着一休禅师“入佛界易，入魔界难”的古训。也许，她也是进不了“魔界”，才求助于神灵的保佑。然而，没有“魔界”就没有“佛界”，是“魔界”创造了“佛界”。
    这东瀛女子，是想面壁十年图破壁，跨进“魔界”的殿堂么？
