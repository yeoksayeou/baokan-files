Angolan rebel forces intensify military actions

Angolan government leaders refuse to engage with UNITA

	Xinhua News Agency, Luanda, January 26th - The General Staff of the Angolan Armed Forces issued a statement on the 25th saying that the Angolan rebel forces, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), have recently intensified their armed attacks in an attempt to attract international attention.

	The areas where UNITA has intensified military actions include the northern provinces of Uige and Malanje, the western province of Benguela, the eastern provinces of Moxico and Bié, the central province of Huambo, and the southern province of Huíla.

	The Angolan government issued an amnesty law at the end of last year, effective from February 4th of this year, for a period of one year, providing a way out for UNITA members who lay down their arms and surrender to the government.

	According to reports, UNITA has issued a statement rejecting the amnesty, demanding direct negotiations with the government to achieve reconciliation, otherwise it will continue to fight, including urban guerrilla warfare. The newly inaugurated U.S. President Bush had previously expressed his intention to continue supporting UNITA.

	Some Angolan government leaders have repeatedly emphasized in recent speeches that they refuse to engage in any form of contact with UNITA.

　　安哥拉反政府武装加强军事行动    
    政府领导人拒绝与安盟接触
    新华社罗安达１月２６日电  安哥拉武装部队总参谋部２５日发表公报说，安哥拉反政府武装力量——争取安哥拉彻底独立全国联盟（安盟）近来加强了武装袭击行动，以图引起国际舆论的关注。
    安盟加强军事行动的地区包括北部的威热省和马兰热省、西部的本格拉省、东部的莫希科省和比耶省、中部的万博省、南部的威拉省。
    安哥拉政府去年底颁布从今年２月４日起实行为期一年的大赦法，对放下武器、向政府投诚的安盟人员提供出路。
    据报道，安盟已发表声明拒绝大赦，要求与政府直接谈判，实现和解，否则将继续战斗，包括城市游击战。美国新任总统布什在就职前曾表示将继续支持安盟。
    安哥拉一些政府领导人在最近的讲话中多次重申，拒绝与安盟进行任何形式的接触。
