Diplomatic activities surrounding the Afghan issue have intensified as the deadline for the complete withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan (February 15) approaches. The focus is on achieving a peaceful and political resolution to the Afghan problem.

Pakistani Foreign Minister Yakub Khan departed Islamabad on January 29 for Riyadh to discuss the recent developments in Afghanistan with Saudi Arabian leaders. On January 12, he had visited Saudi Arabia and held talks with Saudi leaders on regional issues and the Afghan problem.

Observers here believe that Yakub Khan's visit to Saudi Arabia is of great significance. Since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, Saudi Arabia has closely monitored the situation and provided valuable humanitarian aid to over 5 million Afghan refugees living in Pakistan and Iran. The first round of direct talks between the Soviet Union and Afghan resistance forces was held in Saudi Arabia's Taif last December.

According to official sources, Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati will arrive in Islamabad on January 31 for a three-day visit to Pakistan. During his visit, he will hold multiple talks with Pakistani leaders on the Afghan issue.

Although Iran is not a party to the indirect talks on resolving the Afghan issue, it remains highly concerned because it hosts approximately 2 million Afghan refugees.

Gulbuddin, the leader of the Afghan Islamic Party based in Pakistan, recently visited Iran. He held talks with Afghan resistance leaders based there on forming a consultative committee to prepare for the establishment of an Afghan power structure. During his stay in Iran, Gulbuddin met with the Iranian President and Foreign Minister, who expressed hope that all Afghan resistance forces could unite.

Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze will visit Islamabad on February 4. This will be the highest-level visit by a Soviet leader to Pakistan since the late 1960s. He will hold important talks with Pakistani leaders on the Afghan issue.

Early this month, Soviet First Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir Petrovsky visited Pakistan. He held talks with Pakistani leaders and Afghan resistance leaders on resolving the Afghan issue. However, the talks were unsuccessful because the Afghan resistance leaders rejected the proposal for a ceasefire in Afghanistan and refused to include Najibullah's Afghan People's Democratic Party in the consultative committee.

According to reports, the Kabul government's Foreign Ministry spokesman accused some Western countries of closing their embassies in Kabul, saying they were waging psychological warfare against the Kabul government.

The spokesman said that the situation in Kabul had not changed, and the authorities were capable of defending the capital's security.

### 围绕阿富汗问题的外交活动

　　围绕阿富汗问题的外交活动
    新华社记者  李家声
    随着苏联军队全部撤出阿富汗截止日期（２月１５日）的临近，围绕和平与政治解决阿富汗问题的外交活动日趋增多起来。
    巴基斯坦外长雅各布·汗２９日离开伊斯兰堡前往利雅得，以期同沙特阿拉伯领导人讨论阿富汗的最近局势。１月１２日，他曾访问过沙特，并同沙特领导人就本地区形势及阿富汗问题举行了会谈。
    此间观察家们认为，雅各布·汗的此次沙特之行是极为重要的。
    自苏联军队１９７９年入侵阿富汗以来，沙特一直密切注视阿富汗的形势，并对居住在巴基斯坦和伊朗的５００多万阿富汗难民给予了可贵的人道主义援助。去年１２月苏联与阿富汗游击队的第一轮直接会谈便是在沙特的塔伊夫市举行的。
    据此间官方人士说，伊朗外长阿里·阿克巴尔·韦拉亚提将于１月３１日抵达伊斯兰堡，对巴基斯坦进行为期３天的访问。访问期间，他将就阿富汗问题同巴基斯坦领导人举行多次会谈。
    尽管伊朗不属于关于解决阿富汗问题间接会谈的任何一方，但它仍对会谈极为关注，因为它那里居住着约２００万阿富汗难民。
    党部设在巴基斯坦的阿富汗伊斯兰党领导人古勒卜丁最近前往伊朗，同总部设在那里的阿富汗游击队领导人就组成协商委员会问题举行会谈，以便为成立阿富汗的权力机构做准备。古勒卜丁在伊朗停留期间，伊朗总统和外长会见了他，并希望所有阿富汗游击队能够团结起来。
    苏联外长谢瓦尔德纳泽将于２月４日访问伊斯兰堡。这将是６０年代后期以来访问巴基斯坦的苏联最高级领导人。他将同巴基斯坦领导人就阿富汗问题举行重要会谈。
    １月初，苏联第一副外长沃龙佐夫已访问了巴基斯坦。他同巴基斯坦领导人和阿富汗抵抗力量领导人就解决阿富汗问题进行了会谈。但会谈没有取得成功，因为阿富汗抵抗力量领导人拒绝接受在阿富汗停火的建议，同时拒绝以纳吉布拉为首的阿富汗人民民主党加入协商委员会。
    据报道，喀布尔政权外交部发言人２８日指责一些西方国家关闭驻喀布尔的大使馆，说它们是在对喀布尔政府搞心理战。
    这位发言人说，喀布尔的情况未发生任何变化，当局有能力保卫首都的安全。
