Thai Foreign Minister Siddhi Savetsila and Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach today morning concluded their second round of talks at the Presidential Palace in Hanoi and told reporters that they were satisfied with the results.

Siddhi arrived in Hanoi yesterday for a visit.

He held two rounds of talks with Nguyen Co Thach on the Cambodian issue and other matters of common concern.

Both sides did not disclose the specific content of the talks.

Siddhi said the talks were more successful than he had anticipated.

Nguyen Co Thach said the differences between Vietnam and Thailand on the Cambodian issue "have narrowed." However, he declined to comment on the differences of opinion between the leaders of the Cambodian resistance forces, Prince Sihanouk, and the Prime Minister of the Phnom Penh regime, Hun Sen, on internal Cambodian issues.

Nguyen Co Thach also said that Thai Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan will visit Vietnam this year.

Siddhi will meet with the General Secretary of the Vietnamese Communist Party, Nguyen Van Linh, and Prime Minister Do Muoi tomorrow.
