Soviet forces have intensified their bombing of various regions in Afghanistan as the deadline for their complete withdrawal (February 15) approaches, causing significant losses among innocent Afghan civilians and Muslim guerrillas.

According to reports, Soviet aircraft have focused their bombing on rural areas and Afghan guerrilla bases, including Parwan Province, Paktia Province, Farah Province, and Uruzgan Province. The bombing has resulted in the deaths and injuries of hundreds of Afghan civilians and the destruction of numerous homes. In recent bombings of Uruzgan Province, at least 40 people were killed and dozens of houses were destroyed.

According to the Geneva Agreement signed last April on the political settlement of the Afghan issue, the Soviet Union is required to withdraw all its troops from Afghanistan by February 15 of this year. By August 15 last year, half of the 115,000 Soviet troops that invaded Afghanistan had already been withdrawn.

Reports indicate that the bombs currently being dropped by Soviet aircraft in Afghanistan are newly produced, high-explosive heavy bombs, which have not been used since the start of the Afghan war. Meanwhile, Soviet forces are handing over their weapons and ammunition to the Kabul government's army. Observers believe that the Soviet bombing actions violate the spirit of the Geneva Agreement and are also inconsistent with the understanding reached at the time, which was that Soviet military actions would only be used to ensure their safe withdrawal.

Yesterday, Burhanuddin Rabbani, one of the leaders of the Afghan Seven-Party Alliance, called on UN Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar to closely monitor the current Soviet military bombing in Afghanistan during a press conference in Islamabad.

According to reports, the Soviet bombing has forced many Afghan civilians to cross the border into Pakistan to seek refuge. Since last November, more than 350 Afghan refugees have been entering Pakistan daily, becoming refugees. Since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979, more than 3 million Afghans have fled to Pakistan.

As Soviet aircraft intensify their bombing, Soviet troops continue to withdraw from Afghanistan, and their positions are being gradually handed over to the Kabul government's army. According to reports, approximately 30,000 Afghan Muslim guerrillas have surrounded Kabul. They are preparing to launch a final assault on Kabul after the complete withdrawal of Soviet forces. Recently, the United States, Japan, Austria, Britain, France, and some other European countries, concerned about Afghanistan's security issues and political turmoil, have decided to close their embassies in Kabul.

### 苏军在全部撤出阿富汗之前进行狂轰滥炸

　　苏军在全部撤出阿富汗之前进行狂轰滥炸
    新华社记者  汤水富
    在苏联军队全部撤出阿富汗的截止日期（二月十五日）来临之前，苏联飞机加紧了对阿富汗各地的轰炸，给无辜的阿富汗平民和穆斯林游击队造成重大损失。
    据报道，苏联飞机重点轰炸农村地区和阿富汗游击队的基地，其中包括帕尔万省、帕克蒂亚省、法拉省和乌鲁兹甘省。苏联飞机炸死炸伤数百名阿富汗平民，炸毁了大批房屋。在最近几次对乌鲁兹甘省的轰炸中，至少有四十人被炸死、几十幢房屋被炸毁。
    根据去年四月签署的关于政治解决阿富汗问题的日内瓦协议，苏联应在今年二月十五日以前从阿富汗撤出它的全部军队。到去年八月十五日，苏联入侵阿富汗的十一点五万军队已撤出一半。
    据报道，苏联飞机目前在阿富汗投下的炸弹是新生产的、爆炸力强的重型炸弹。自阿富汗战争开始以来，这种炸弹尚属首次使用。与此同时，苏联军队正在把它的武器弹药留交给喀布尔政府军。观察家们认为，苏联的轰炸之举违背了日内瓦协议的精神，同时也不符合当时达成的谅解，即苏军采取的行动只用于保障其安全撤出。
    阿富汗七党联盟领导人之一布尔汉丁·拉巴尼昨天在伊斯兰堡举行的一次记者招待会上，呼吁联合国秘书长佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔密切注视目前苏联军队在阿富汗的狂轰滥炸等暴行。
    据报道，苏联飞机的轰炸又迫使不少阿富汗平民越过边界到巴基斯坦避难。自去年十一月以来，每天有三百五十多名阿富汗人涌入巴基斯坦境内，沦为难民。自一九七九年十二月苏联入侵阿富汗以来，涌入巴基斯坦的阿难民已达三百多万人。
    在苏联飞机加紧轰炸的同时，苏联军队继续从阿富汗撤出，阵地正在有步骤地移交给喀布尔政府军。据报道，目前，已有大约三万名阿富汗穆斯林游击队包围着喀布尔。他们准备在苏联军队全部撤出后，对喀布尔发起总攻。最近，美、日、奥地利、英国、法国和一些其他欧洲国家慑于阿富汗的安全问题和政治动乱，已决定关闭它们驻喀布尔的大使馆。　　（新华社伊斯兰堡一月二十九日电）
