300 new workers entered the factory, but within less than a month, 50 left. Someone left with the words: "This place is just like Wild Wheat Ridge!"

In July of last year, 300 young men and women became new employees of Tianjin Yuhua Garment Industry Company. "Yuhua" is a collective enterprise specializing in export garments, with relatively high employee income and a well-known brand. The new workers were happy to join the company, but after a few days, complaints started to arise.

"Hey! They manage too strictly here, fining you for the slightest thing."

"Yeah! You have to punch in for work, it's like entering a prison!"

"Hmph! Forget about being late or leaving early, even spitting or smoking is not allowed."

Most of the new workers were young women in their prime. What they found hardest to accept was: no makeup, lipstick, or rouge allowed in the factory.

Indeed, Yuhua Company's strict management is famous in Tianjin. There are 78 factory rules, 103 economic responsibility clauses, and three major disciplines and eight points of attention for employees. Violating any of these results in fines. Some new workers liked Yuhua's brand and good benefits but couldn't stand the strict discipline. Within a month, 50 left, with someone saying as they left: "This place is just like Wild Wheat Ridge!"

Ah, Wild Wheat Ridge! That phrase again.

Yuhua Company was originally the 15th Garment Factory in Tianjin. In 1979, the deputy director of the original Tianjin Xinhua Garment Factory, Gong Wenlin, became the director of this factory. ...

After Gong Wenlin took office, he implemented a series of strict management measures, and some workers had complaints, even writing letters of complaint saying: "Gong Wenlin is all about control, restriction, and pressure" and "Gong Wenlin is a capitalist."

One year, the Japanese film "Wild Wheat Ridge" was shown. Gong Wenlin heard that this film exposed the exploitation and oppression of workers by capitalists, thinking: Good! Let the workers watch it and get educated, so they won't always say our factory is too strict. The factory organized the workers to watch the movie, but unexpectedly, some workers just walked out of the theater shouting: "Our factory is just like Wild Wheat Ridge!" In an instant, the saying that the 15th Factory was Wild Wheat Ridge spread. However, as time passed, most workers got used to the strict management, and the saying "Wild Wheat Ridge" faded away.

Now, the old saying "Wild Wheat Ridge" is resurfacing.

Yuhua's strict management is extraordinary. Even in the summer, flies are not allowed in the workshop, and if there are flies, fines are imposed. Manager Gong Wenlin jokingly said: "Even the flies in Yuhua have a price."

In Yuhua, if a fly is found in the cafeteria, the responsible person is fined 1 jiao, and if a fly is found in the workshop, 5 fen. This was the original "price," but now in the cafeteria, it's 2 jiao, and in the workshop, it's 1 jiao. Gong Wenlin joked: "Now prices have gone up, so the flies' prices have to go up too."

In such a large factory, flies are inevitable, is the fine really necessary?

Export garments not only require fine processing but also require clean fabric, with no stains. Flies flying and landing will inevitably leave droppings on the fabric. High-quality products require a highly clean and hygienic environment. This is why Yuhua does not allow flies in the workshop, does not allow employees to smoke or spit in the factory, and does not allow female workers to wear makeup, rouge, or lipstick while on duty...

The formerly dirty, chaotic, and substandard factory is now a clean and hygienic place with a beautiful environment. Walking into Yuhua's six-story building, you won't see spit, cigarette butts, or stains and scratches on the walls. The workshop floor has no scraps of fabric or thread. Outside the window, it's already the cold winter, but inside the building, potted flowers bring a warm spring feeling.

How should we view this phenomenon: the television monitoring system's camera is aimed at the working employees. How can the "owner" be monitored?

In the workshop, the sewing machines click-clack away, and rows of workers are busy processing garments. On the wall, a surveillance camera silently scans every corner of the workshop, and the workers' every move appears on the manager's office television screen.

"This isn't the capitalist way of monitoring workers!" In 1985, the company installed this television monitoring system, and some workers felt indignant.

Gong Wenlin's intention in installing this system was to improve management efficiency and facilitate production command. It's strange, but originally, there were incidents of fabric and garments being lost in the workshop, and some workers even secretly cut good fabric. Since the cameras were installed, such incidents have not occurred again. It seems that this television monitoring system indeed had a "monitoring effect."

"Do you not feel that the camera is monitoring you?" we asked a few female workers. "Hey! Monitoring or not, we don't steal or take things, so why should we be afraid of that!" a young female worker replied frankly. An old worker put it even more bluntly: "If you talk about monitoring, it's monitoring a few people. Whether there's this thing or not, most people work the same way."

"Monitoring is not a good word, actually, monitoring is just supervision. Workers can supervise cadres, and cadres can supervise workers." This is how Gong Wenlin understands "monitoring."

Yuhua's strict management is not just aimed at workers; cadres are also subject to factory rules. Even Gong Wenlin himself has been fined several times. Once, Gong Wenlin's bicycle was not parked in the designated spot, and a security officer saw it. Without a word, he said, "Manager, pay the fine!"

In a socialist enterprise, the factory director and manager are not the capitalists of Wild Wheat Ridge, and the workers are not the toiling "laborers." If you say they are owners, they are all owners of the enterprise, but in the production system, workers as laborers must obey the management authority of the factory director and manager. The workers' ownership is not reflected in not being constrained in production but in democratic management of the enterprise.

The company has a manager's mailbox, regular manager reception days; the union has hired a group of part-time information officers from among the employees, who are dedicated to supervising the work of cadres and reflecting the voices of the masses; the workers' congress also regularly discusses the company's major policies. Even those strict systems are discussed and passed by the workers' congress, not arbitrarily set by Gong Wenlin. Gong Wenlin often says: I implement strict management according to the will of the majority.

Workers have the right to rest, but Yuhua's workers often have to work overtime. To complete the production tasks, the workers also understand.

The delivery dates for export garments are fixed, and if delayed by one day, foreign traders will demand compensation. To meet the delivery dates, workers often have to work overtime for several hours.

Most garment workers are women, who need to take care of their children and handle household chores. Because of overtime work, their husbands often get angry, and some even want to divorce their wives. Some workers have also jointly written letters to higher authorities to complain.

Indeed, workers who have been laboring all day also want to reunite with their families early. The 8-hour workday is a worker's right, and a socialist enterprise should guarantee workers' rest rights. Although Yuhua Company has thought of many ways to reduce the burden of overtime work for workers, under the current production conditions, it is still not possible to completely eliminate overtime work.

Most workers understand this. Reform has made workers and enterprises a community of shared destiny. The garment industry is highly competitive, and if Yuhua's brand is ruined, workers' jobs will also be ruined. A 30-year-old female worker, Yang Zhihong, told us: "If the factory doesn't do well, what benefits do workers have? We can endure the overtime work."

Overtime work is not praiseworthy and should not be used as proof of workers' high enthusiasm. People should have more leisure time, but ideals and reality have gaps.

The old saying "Wild Wheat Ridge" resurfaced in Yuhua Company but did not cause much of a stir. Most employees view Gong Wenlin's strict management this way: It's okay to be strict, as long as it brings us benefits. Strict management brings results. In less than 10 years, Yuhua has grown from a factory with 400 people to a garment joint venture with 21 branches and 4,000 employees, and workers' income has increased several times.

Yuhua is not Wild Wheat Ridge, and Gong Wenlin is not a capitalist. Yuhua has held democratic elections for the factory director and manager three times, and the vast majority of employees have voted for Gong Wenlin.

　　这里是野麦岭？
  　——天津宇华制衣实业公司采访札记
    本报记者  皮树义  张锦力
    ３００名新工人进厂，呆了不到１个月，走了５０人，有人撂下一句话：“这里简直是野麦岭？”
    去年７月，３００名青年男女成了天津宇华制衣实业公司的新工人。“宇华”是一家集体企业，专做出口服装，职工收入不低，牌子赫赫有名。新工人高高兴兴进厂，可是，呆了几天就怨声载道了。
    “咳！管得太严了，动不动就要罚款。”
    “哎！上下班要打卡，进厂像进监狱！”
    “哼！别说迟到早退，连吐口痰、抽口烟都不行。”
    新工人多是正值青春年华的姑娘，她们最不能接受的是：搽粉、抹红、涂唇膏不许进厂。
    是的，宇华公司的严格管理在天津是出了名的。厂规７８条，经济责任制１０３条，职工三大纪律八项注意，违反哪一条都要罚款。一些新工人喜欢宇华的牌子亮，待遇好，却受不了严格的约束，不到１个月走了５０人。有人走时撂下一句话：“这里简直是野麦岭！”
    啊，野麦岭！又是这句话。
    宇华公司原是天津第１５服装厂。１９７９年，原天津新华服装厂副厂长龚文林来这个厂当厂长。……龚文林上任后实行了一系列严格的管理措施，一些工人颇有怨言，甚至有人写告状信说：“龚文林搞管、卡、压”“龚文林是资本家”。　　
    有一年，放映日本电影《野麦岭》。龚文林听说这是揭露资本家对工人剥削压榨的片子，心想：好！让工人看看受教育，别老说咱厂管得严。厂里组织工人看了电影，没曾想有的工人刚走出影院就喊上了：“咱厂子跟野麦岭差不离儿啊！”一时间１５厂是野麦岭的说法就传开了。不过，时间一长，多数工人对严格管理已经习惯了，“野麦岭”的说法也就销声匿迹了。
    如今，“野麦岭”旧话重提。
　“宇华”严格管理严得出奇，大夏天车间里不准有苍蝇，有苍蝇就罚款。经理龚文林戏称：“宇华”的苍蝇也有价。
    在“宇华”，食堂里发现一只苍蝇罚责任者１角，在车间发现一只苍蝇罚５分。这是原来的“价”，如今在食堂１只是２角，车间里１只是１角。龚文林开玩笑说：“现在物价涨了，苍蝇也得提价。”
    偌大工厂，苍蝇难免，罚款是否多此一举？
    出口服装不仅要求加工精细，还要求面料洁净，不能有一点污迹。苍蝇乱飞乱落，难免在布料上留下屎点。高质量的产品需要有高度清洁卫生的环境，正因为如此，“宇华”才不准车间里有苍蝇，才不准职工进厂抽烟、随地吐痰，才不准女工搽粉、抹红、涂唇膏上班……
    昔日脏、乱、差的工厂如今已是清洁卫生、环境优美的地方。走进“宇华”的六层大楼，见不到痰迹、烟灰，墙面上没有污点、划痕，车间的地上也没有碎布、线头。窗外已是肃杀的冬天，楼内一盆盆鲜花带给人的却是融融春意。 　怎样认识这种现象：电视监控系统的镜头对着劳动的工人。“主人”怎么能受监视？
    车间里一台台缝纫机嗒嗒地响着，一排排工人埋头加工服装，墙上一架电视摄像机悄悄地扫描着车间的每个角落，工人的一举一动都出现在经理办公室的电视屏幕上。
    “这不是资本家监视工人那一套吗！”１９８５年，公司安装了这套电视监控系统，愤懑也涌上了一些工人心头。
    龚文林安装这套系统的本意，是提高管理效率，方便指挥生产。说来也怪，原来车间里时有发生丢失布料、服装的事，有的工人甚至把好好的布料偷偷剪坏。自从安上了摄像机，这类事居然没再发生，看来，这套电视监控系统也确实产生了“监视效应”。
    “你们不觉得这摄像机在监视着你们吗？”我们问几位女工。“咳！啥监视不监视的，我们不偷不摸，怕那个干嘛！”一位青年女工爽快地回答。一位老工人说得更直截了当：“要说监视，监视的是少数人。有没有这个东西，多数人都一样干活”。
    “监视这个词儿不好听，其实监视也就是监督。工人可以监督干部，干部也可以监督工人”。龚文林这样理解“监视”。
    “宇华”的严格管理并不只是只对着工人，干部同样受到厂规的约束，就连龚文林本人也几次挨罚。一次，龚文林的自行车没有放在指定地点，一位保卫干部见了，二话没说，“经理，拿钱认罚吧！”
    在社会主义企业里，厂长、经理不是“野麦岭”的资本家，工人也不是卖命的“苦力”。要说是主人，同是企业的主人，但在生产系统内，工人作为劳动者必须服从厂长、经理的管理权威，工人的主人地位不是体现在生产中的不受约束上，而是体现在对企业的民主管理上。
    公司设有经理信箱，有定期的经理接待日；工会从职工中聘请了一批业余信息员，专门监督干部工作、反映群众呼声；职代会也定期讨论公司的大政方针。就说那些严格的制度吧，也是职代会讨论通过的，不是龚文林随心所欲订的。龚文林常说：我是按多数人的意志来实行严格管理。
　　劳动者有休息的权利，而“宇华”的工人时常要加班加点。为了完成生产任务，工人们也理解。
    出口服装的交货期雷打不动，延期１天外商就要索赔，为了赶交货期，工人时常要加班加点，一加就要几个小时。
    服装工人多是女工，孩子要照顾，家务事要料理。因为加班加点，惹得丈夫们常发雷霆，有的竟要跟妻子离婚。也有的工人联名写信向上级告状。
    是啊，劳累一天的工人谁不想早点与家人团聚。８小时工作制是工人的权利，社会主义企业理应保障工人的休息权。尽管宇华公司想了许多办法来减轻工人加班加点的负担，但是在现在的生产条件下，还做不到完全不加班加点。
    对此，大多数工人是理解的。改革已使工人与企业结成了命运共同体。服装行业竞争激烈，砸了“宇华”的牌子，也就砸了工人的饭碗。３０岁的女工杨志宏对我们说：“工厂搞不好，工人有什么利益？对加班加点，我们能忍受。”
    加班加点不值得赞美，更不必当成工人积极性高涨的证明，人们应当有更多的闲暇时间，但是理想与现实毕竟有差距。
    “野麦岭”旧话重提，在宇华公司并未引起什么波澜。大多数职工这样看待龚文林的严格管理：严不怕，只要能给我们带来实惠就行。严格管理出效益。不到１０年，宇华已从一个４００人的工厂发展成有２１个分厂、４０００名工人的服装联合企业，职工的收入也成倍增长。
    “宇华”不是野麦岭，龚文林也不是资本家。“宇华”３次民主选举厂长、经理，绝大多数职工都把票投给了龚文林。
