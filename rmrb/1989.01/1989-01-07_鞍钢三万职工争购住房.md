In the depths of winter, Anshan Steel Company has seen an unprecedented surge in housing purchases by its employees. A total of 27,000 households have applied to buy new homes, which is 13 times the number of the initially planned 1,900 new homes for sale. Additionally, 3,300 households have expressed interest in purchasing existing homes.

In the first round of housing sales, Anshan Steel adopted policies that encouraged and provided benefits to buyers: based on the Liaoning Province's proposed price of 250 yuan per square meter for Anshan City, Anshan Steel, considering its own construction of duty-built houses and the use of recycled materials to reduce costs by 30%, set the price for this round of sales at approximately 190 yuan per square meter. The price will remain fixed for one year. Buyers need to pay 30% of the total price in cash upfront. For every additional 10% paid, a 2% discount will be applied to the total purchase amount. A 20% discount will be given for full payment upfront. Those who cannot pay the full amount upfront can deduct the cost from their salary over a period of 15 years, with no interest charged for the first 10 years.

Through policy explanations and detailed calculations, the public has reached the following conclusions: saving money to buy goods is not as good as buying a house, and buying a house later is not as good as buying it now. This has significantly boosted the enthusiasm for purchasing homes. According to statistics from 62 units within Anshan Steel, 1,378 households have completed the formalities and made payments, with 94 of these paying the full amount upfront. The total sales amount has reached 12 million yuan, with over 3 million yuan already collected.

　　鞍钢三万职工争购住房
    据新华社沈阳１月６日电  （记者李柱安、通讯员金阳）隆冬季节，鞍山钢铁公司出现了前所未有的职工购房热。全公司已有２．７万户职工申请购买新房，相当于首批计划出售１９００户新房的１３倍。要求购买原有住房的还有３３００户。
    在首次售房中，鞍钢采取了适当鼓励和优惠政策：依据辽宁省给鞍山市拟定的每平方米２５０元的房价标准，鞍钢根据自己义务建房及利用废旧材料建房达到降低成本３０％的情况，这次房价定为实价每平方米１９０元左右。以后一年一定，购房者第一次需付全部房价３０％的现款。每多付１０％，按购房款总额优惠２％。一次全部付清的优惠２０％；无力一次付清现款的，可从工资中按月扣还。扣款期限１５年，前１０年内免收利息。
    通过讲政策、算细帐，群众得出了这样的结论：攒钱买东西不如买房，晚买房不如早买房，购房积极性大增。据对鞍钢６２个单位统计，现在已办完手续交款的有１３７８户，其中一次性交全部款额的有９４户。售房金额达１２００万元，已收款３００多万元。
