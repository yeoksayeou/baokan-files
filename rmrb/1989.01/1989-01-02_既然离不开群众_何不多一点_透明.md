Since we can't do without the masses, why not be more transparent?

Sports cannot do without the masses. Mass sports require mass participation, and competitive sports rely even more on the enthusiasm of sports fans.

Sometimes we seem to place great importance on the masses. The masses are told: "Athletes have 1 billion people in their hearts during competitions." For quite some time, the emotional connection between the masses and athletes was built on this basis. Before a team departs for a competition, they often receive a large number of letters encouraging and expecting the athletes to win for the country, which means to win. Later, the masses were told: this places too much psychological burden on the athletes. Eventually, the truth came out: the best mental state for athletes during a competition is to think of nothing but the competition, which means they do not think about the 1 billion people while competing. In the past year or two, the masses have been guided to understand: well-educated fans should not focus solely on winning or losing. In reality, in matches where the strength is significantly different, fans' demands are simply to lose gracefully and honorably. As for matches where the strength suggests a win, if fans are not enthusiastically hoping for a win and demanding it, what kind of fans are they?

We repeatedly hope that the masses will care about and support sports, even publicly asking for "suggestions and strategies," but the media has not provided the corresponding transparency. Rumors about "inside stories" cannot be confirmed or denied, greatly reducing the openness of sports news. After the Olympics, public opinion repeatedly asked the masses to understand Li Ning, but the true reason why Li Ning did not retire promptly has always been shrouded in secrecy. Recently, an article in the People's Daily discussed "internal consumption," but details about this aspect have never been disclosed. Another article suggested that when selecting the "Top Ten," one should not focus solely on victory or defeat, but the reporting of athletes' performances beyond victory or defeat is extremely insufficient. The masses have opinions about the working methods and styles of various sports commissions, but these have never been brought to the table. Sports matters do not involve political, economic, or national defense secrets, so why cover them up? The various entanglements surrounding He Zhi Li have also not been fully disclosed, depriving the masses of the right to discuss their pros and cons, and what reasonable grounds are there for this? If the masses no longer care about sports and lose interest, what hope does sports have?

Editor's Note:

Reader Wú Dī's letter about increasing the transparency of sports reporting may be seen as a "yellow card" from sports enthusiasts to the sports and media industries. Sports are inherently a matter for the masses. Wú Dī's opinions are precisely what we intend to improve in the new year.

We welcome many readers who care about Chinese sports to frequently send letters and other forms of communication, sincerely and frankly proposing their views and suggestions, working with us to improve public supervision, and promoting the development of China's sports industry.

### 既然离不开群众　何不多一点“透明”

专栏：读者中来

　　既然离不开群众　何不多一点“透明”
    体育离不开群众。群众体育要群众参加，竞技运动更有赖于体育迷的狂热。
    我们有时候显得很重视群众，群众被告知：运动员在比赛时“心里装着１０亿人民”。相当一段时间里，群众与运动员之间的感情沟通就建立在这个基础上。运动队出征前往往收到大量来信，勉励和期望运动员为国争光，也就是要赢。后来群众又被告知：这使运动员心理负担过重。终至有实情传出：运动员比赛时的最佳心理状态是除了比赛什么都不想，就是说他们并没有一边比赛一边想着１０亿人。近一两年群众又受到引导：有教养的球迷不能只盯着输赢。其实，实力悬殊不可能赢的比赛，球迷们的要求无非是输得像样、光彩，至于从实力上说可以赢、应该赢的比赛，如果球迷们不是狂热地希望赢，要求赢，还叫什么球迷？
　
    我们一再希望群众关心和支持体育，甚至公开要求“出谋献策”，可是新闻媒介却根本没有提供相应的透明度。口口相传所透露出的“内幕”，一概得不到证实或否认，使体育新闻的公开性大大降低。奥运会后舆论一再要求群众谅解李宁，但对李宁究竟为什么未能急流勇退的真实原因始终讳莫如深。最近《人民日报》有文章谈到“内耗”，但对这方面的详情从未披露。又有文章要求评选“十佳”时不要只着眼于胜负，但对于运动员在胜负以外的报道又极不充分。群众对各级体委工作方式和工作作风有意见，然而这些从来都不曾被摆到桌面上。体育的事不涉及政治经济国防机密，为什么要遮遮盖盖？围绕何智丽的种种纠葛也不能充分披露，让群众没有个就其是非得失说长道短的权利，能有什么摆得上桌面的理由？如果群众不再关心体育，失去了群众，体育能有多大希望？

    读者吴镝来信中关于提高体育报道透明度的意见，或许可以看作体育爱好者对体育界和新闻界亮出的一块“黄牌”。体育本来就是群众的事。吴镝的意见正是我们在新的一年中所准备改进的。
    欢迎众多关心中国体育的读者经常以来信和其它形式，真诚坦率地提出自己的看法和建议，与我们一块搞好舆论监督，促进我国体育事业的发展。
