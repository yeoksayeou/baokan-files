Yingying Tower is a very famous tower. During the Yuan Dynasty, Wang Shifu used it as a backdrop to write "The Romance of the Western Chamber." Interestingly, inside this tower, or standing around it, people can hear the sounds of frogs, drums, and foxes coming from within. Now, scientists have used recording tests and spectral analysis to find the causes of these strange acoustic effects in Yingying Tower and have provided convincing explanations.

Before this mystery was solved, how did people view it? I have not been to Yuncheng County in Shanxi Province, so I do not know how many unusual things have happened here since the Qing Dynasty's Qianlong period when the "Chuzhou Prefecture Records" documented this phenomenon. However, it can be inferred that there are three main types of reactions: First, there is the attitude of fear and superstition. The sound of frogs inside the tower can still have a poetic and picturesque quality; once the sound of foxes becomes faint, the "spiritual aura" appears. Second, there is indifference, neither believing nor disbelieving. If it does not concern oneself, one respects it from a distance; if one is present, one merely plays around. Third, there is the attitude of denial, claiming to be a "thorough materialist," neither investigating nor researching, dismissing everything that has a hint of superstition as false and deceptive, but forgetting that superstition often borrows from things that people temporarily do not recognize or understand to gain attention.

People often suffer losses due to this blind "thoroughness." As soon as they see something that might be related to superstition, they unconsciously stand on the opposite side, giving a thorough denial. However, they may not have even "seen" it, let alone "seen" it clearly. This blind alertness often forms a conditioned reflex: as soon as someone says this is capitalist, they immediately condemn it, even cursing its ancestors, as if this is the only way to show a firm stance and clear banner. In reality, they may not even know what capitalism is, let alone have any knowledge of it. Imagine, if scientists had ignored the sounds of frogs, drums, and foxes in Yingying Tower, people would still either worship it as a divine entity or simply ignore it.

### 蛙声狐声及其他声

　　蛙声狐声及其他声
    莺莺塔是一座很有名气的塔。元朝的王实甫以它为背景写成《西厢记》。有趣的是，在这座塔里面，或者站在塔的周围，人们便能听到从塔内传出来的蛙声、锣鼓声、狐狸叫声等声音。现在，科学家们经过录音测试和频谱分析，找到了莺莺塔产生这些奇特的声学效应的原因，作出了令人信服的解释。
    在这个谜被解开之前，人们又是怎样来看待它的呢？我没有到过山西省永济县普救寺，不知道自从清朝乾隆年间《蒲州府志》记载了这一现象以来这里究竟发生过多少不寻常的事情。但是，据推测，不外乎这么三种情况：一是诚惶诚恐，抱迷信态度。塔内传蛙声，尚可有“蛙声十里出山泉”的诗情画意；一旦到了狐狸声若隐若现的时候，那“仙气”就来了。二是无所谓信，也无所谓不信。事不关己，敬而远之；身临其境，玩玩而已。三是采取不承认主义，自谓“彻底的唯物主义者”，既不调查又不研究，以为一切与迷信沾了边的统统都是假的，都是骗人的把戏，却忘记了迷信也常常借助于人们暂时还不认识不理解的事物来招摇过市。
    人们吃亏就常常吃在这种盲目的“彻底”上。一看这东西可能与迷信有牵连，马上就自觉不自觉地站到迷信的对立面，来个彻底的否定。殊不知自己可能连“看”也没有“看”到过，更谈不上“看”清楚了。这种盲目的警惕性，常常使人形成一种条件反射，一说这是资本主义的，马上就口诛笔伐，连它的祖宗八代也骂下来，似乎这样才是立场坚定，旗帜鲜明。实际上资本主义到底是怎么一回事他却未必清楚，甚至对它一无所知。试想，倘若科学家们对莺莺塔内的蛙声、锣鼓声、狐狸声充耳不闻、不屑一顾，人们不是还要对它或则奉若神明、或则熟视无睹下去么？　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　项东
