The first children's art exhibition in Dazhu County, Sichuan, held on New Year's Day, has made headlines: dozens of exquisite and outstanding "excellent" works were unexpectedly disqualified, while 35 works of slightly lower artistic level were awarded. Surprisingly, both the winning and disqualified children, as well as their parents and teachers, were taken aback but also convinced.

The participants in this exhibition were children under six years old from 19 kindergartens and preschool classes in the county, with drawings as the main entries, along with some paper cuttings, clay sculptures, and woven crafts. About half of the entries were meticulously crafted, with vivid shapes, rich and unique imagination, and styles almost mature. Some attentive viewers privately discussed: could these works really be created by six-year-old children?

These discussions caught the attention of the organizers. They believed that if works with adult interference and exaggeration were to win, it would be a blow to the honest children who created their own works, and it would plant the seeds of social malpractices in the children's young minds. They specially invited several influential and responsible artists to serve as judges to help determine the authenticity and quality of the works. After careful examination, it was found that about half of the works had obvious adult influence and signs of being modified by adults. For example, a drawing titled "Mother Hen and Chicks" was praised for its ingenious composition and precise brushwork, but it had clear traces of an adult using a colored pencil to sketch the outlines. For such works, the organizers either questioned the young authors, compared them with the children's recent works, or consulted with people familiar with the children. After thorough investigation, the judges evaluated the works with an objective attitude, awarding five first prizes, ten second prizes, and twenty third prizes.

The announcement of the awards immediately caused a stir among the relevant parties. A parent who had meticulously prepared and directly assisted in the hope of winning an award was originally confident that his child's work would be awarded. After being disqualified, he regretted his actions: "I meant well but did harm instead. This evaluation has awakened me; I cannot teach my child to cheat!"

　　丹青当写童心　何须家长捉刀
  　大竹幼儿画展“优秀”作品落选 
    一代笔家长说：“不能教小孩弄虚作假”
    本报讯  四川大竹县元旦举办的“首届幼儿画展”评奖活动传出新闻：几十件精美超群、有望中奖的“优秀”作品突然落选，３５件艺术水平稍次的作品获奖。令人惊奇的是，得奖和落选的幼儿及他们的家长、老师都感意外，又都心悦诚服。
    参加这次画展的，是全县１９所小学学前班和幼儿园６岁以下幼儿的作品，以画为主，另有剪纸、手工泥塑、编织品等小制作。其中，约半数绘制精巧玲珑，造型栩栩如生，想象丰富奇特，风格几近成熟。少数细心的观众私下议论：这些作品真的出自６岁幼儿之手？
    这些议论，引起了主办单位的重视。他们认为：如果让大人加工过的有水分的作品获奖，对那些自己绘制作品的诚实孩子是一个打击，会使社会上的不正之风在孩子幼小的心灵中播下阴影。他们特邀了一些艺术上较有影响、责任心较强的画家任评委，帮助鉴定作品水平高低、有无水分。经仔细鉴别，发现半数左右的作品有明显的成人味和被大人加工改制过的痕迹。如有幅“鸡妈妈和小鸡”的画，构思之巧，用笔之精，令人叫绝，却有大人用水彩笔在画中勾画雏形线条的明显痕迹。对这类作品，主办单位或找小作者询问，或与幼儿近期的其它作品相比较，或找熟悉幼儿的知情人核实。经多方调查后，评委们以实事求是的态度评出一等奖５个、二等奖１０个、三等奖２０个。
    评奖结果一公布，即引起有关各方震动。一位事前精心准备、直接帮忙、志在夺奖的家长，原以为孩子的作品必定中奖。落选后，他后悔不迭：“我好心帮了倒忙。这次评奖评醒了我，不能教小孩弄虚作假！”
