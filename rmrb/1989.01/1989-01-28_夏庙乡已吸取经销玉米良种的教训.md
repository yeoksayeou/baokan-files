	Xiaomiao Township has learned from the lesson of selling corn seeds.

	After your newspaper published the reader's letter "How Can We Not Want It Even If We Don't Want It" on August 10, 1988, we sent people to investigate.

	In March 1988, the Xiaomiao Township government purchased 1,688 kilograms of corn seeds at a price of 1.9 yuan per kilogram. After the seeds were delivered, the accountant of the township enterprise allocated them to six villages according to the quantities reported by each village. The selling price was 2 yuan per kilogram.

	Among the six villages that purchased corn seeds from the township government, only Zhao Village had poor germination after sowing. At that time, some people noticed the poor germination and stopped sowing, promptly replanting with other crops.

	The Xiaomiao Township Party Committee and the township government actively introduced high-quality seeds to supply the villagers. Their subjective intentions were good, but they did not follow the relevant regulations for the sale of high-quality seeds and purchased deteriorated seeds, causing some economic losses to the farmers in Zhao Village. The Xiaomiao Township government is responsible for this. They should learn from this lesson, apologize to the people, and mitigate the impact. For the corn seeds purchased by Zhao Village that did not germinate, the funds already collected should be refunded in full, and those not yet collected should not be demanded.

　　夏庙乡已吸取经销玉米良种的教训
    你报１９８８年８月１０日刊登《岂能不要也得要》的读者来信后，我们派人作了调查。
    夏庙乡政府于１９８８年３月购进玉米种１６８８公斤，进价每公斤１．９元。种子运到后，乡镇企业会计按各村报来的所需数量，分配给６个村。售价每公斤２元。
    购买乡政府玉米种子的６个村中只有赵庄村下种后出芽不好。当时一些人发现出苗不好就停止播种，及时补种了其它庄稼。
    夏庙乡党委、乡政府积极引进良种供应村民，他们的主观愿望是好的，但是没有按照良种经销的有关规定进行检验，购进了变质的种子，给赵庄村农民造成了一定的经济损失。对此，夏庙乡政府是有责任的。他们要认真吸取教训，向群众赔礼道歉，挽回影响。对赵庄村购进不出芽的玉米种子款，已收的如数退回，未收的不得再收。
