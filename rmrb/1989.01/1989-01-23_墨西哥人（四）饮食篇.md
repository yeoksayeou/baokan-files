Mexicans believe that their cuisine blends the traditions of the indigenous people with the European influences of Spain, reflecting a unique national character. Indeed, each region in Mexico has its own distinctive flavors. However, regardless of the variety, corn-based foods always top the menu. From street snacks to family gatherings, from ordinary restaurants to state banquets, soups, dishes, seasonings, staples, and desserts—almost everything includes corn. Roughly speaking, there are about 40 different types of corn-based foods.

The most common is the corn tortilla. Every household has a neat little basket, inside which are warm, fragrant tortillas wrapped in a napkin. Roll them up with a salad made from tomatoes, chilies, and cactus leaves, and you have a refreshing and delicious meal. If you roll the tortillas with ham and vegetables and fry them in oil, they become "tacos," which are crispy and fragrant with a different flavor. Sometimes, people also spread guacamole on the crispy tacos. At a dinner hosted by former President Echeverría, I also had such tacos. For many workers, a typical lunch consists of a cup of coffee and two tacos.

Mexicans, like the Chinese, enjoy eating roasted corn on the cob. The greenish-yellow corn cobs are drizzled with white cream, red tomato sauce, and yellow mustard, making them look appetizing. One of the favorite snacks among Mexicans is popcorn. This is a special variety of corn. When the kernels are placed in hot oil and covered, they pop open with a crackling sound without needing any pressure. There is also a corn dish called "tamales," wrapped in corn leaves or banana leaves with corn dough, meat, or other fillings like chicken strips or spicy corn sauce, depending on personal taste. Once cooked, they are opened and eaten, resembling Chinese zongzi.

The most unforgettable experience was at a state banquet hosted by the Mexican President for the heads of state attending the Six-Nation Summit. The first course was soup. The main dish was a half-moon-shaped "pie" wrapped in yellow cheese. When cut open with a knife, it revealed a black, soft, mushroom-like substance inside. Upon tasting it carefully, I still couldn't identify it. After asking the host next to me, I learned that it was a fungus that grows on corn cobs, which Mexicans call "cuitlacoche." Later, I found out that fresh ones are sold in Mexican markets, and supermarkets also sell canned versions.

Corn can be said to be the primary food for Mexicans. According to statistics, 65% of the calories and 50% of the protein consumed by rural residents, and 50% of the calories and 40% of the protein consumed by urban residents, come from various corn-based foods. Corn planting accounts for 54% of all agricultural crops in Mexico, yet the country still imports a significant amount of corn each year. Some say Mexico is the birthplace of corn because it was the Mexicans who first cultivated it. In Mexican museums, there are corn fossils dating back thousands of years. In ancient Indian totems, one of the most revered gods is the corn god: his sturdy body resembles a ripe, full corn cob, and his divine crown is made of three corn cobs. In Indian legends, humans and corn are inseparable, like Adam and Eve. Humans cultivated corn, and corn nourished humans. Humans resemble corn, and corn resembles humans; they are each other's deities.

Just as rice symbolizes Asian civilization, wheat symbolizes European civilization, corn, first cultivated by the indigenous people of the Americas, symbolizes American civilization. These three civilizations have enabled human survival and progress. The United Nations chose Mexico to establish the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center. There, scholars from the United States, China, India, and other countries, along with Mexican scholars, are using modern scientific methods to advance the ancient corn civilization. Indian scholar Karim showed me his insect laboratory. Through countless screenings, a new corn variety is being developed that is edible for humans but not for insects. Chinese scholar Dr. Han Gengchen led me to his high-yield hybrid corn experimental field. Dr. Han said that by altering the seed's genes, the inherent lysine and oil content of corn can be increased, thereby allowing humans to obtain more nutrition from limited food. Here, ancient civilization is taking flight with modern science, writing a new chapter in Mexico's and the world's corn diet.

　　墨西哥人（四）饮食篇
    本报记者  郭伟成
    墨西哥人认为他们的饮食把印第安传统与西班牙欧洲风格熔于一炉，体现了鲜明的民族特色。的确，在墨西哥各地都有独特的地方风味。但是，不管有多么纷繁，列入食谱之首的总是玉米食品。从街头小吃到家庭聚餐，从一般餐馆到堂堂国宴，汤、菜、调料、主食、点心，几乎样样用得上玉米。粗算算，常见的约有４０种。
    最普通的是玉米面小饼。家家都有一个精致的小筐，里头用餐巾包着小饼热乎乎、香喷喷，卷上用西红柿、辣椒、仙人掌叶拌的沙拉，吃起来清香可口。若是玉米面小饼卷上火腿肉、小菜，在油锅里炸起，就叫做“塔科”，又脆又香，另是一番风味。有时也把锷梨酱抹在炸脆的塔科上吃。在前总统埃切维里亚的家宴上，我也吃过这样的塔科，一般劳动者的工作日午餐，常常是一杯咖啡、２个塔科就打发了。
    墨西哥人也像中国人一样，爱嚼老玉米棒。青里透黄的玉米棒上，淋上白色的奶油、红色的蕃茄汁、黄色的芥末酱，让人瞧着眼馋。墨西哥人最爱吃的零食之一是玉米花。这是很特别的玉米品种。把玉米粒子放到熬热的油锅里，盖上加温，不需要加压，就会噼噼啪啪地炸开了花。还有一种叫做“塔马莱斯”的玉米食品，用玉米叶子或香蕉叶子裹上玉米面、肉；或者随口味不同夹上鸡丝、玉米面做的辣酱等等，煮熟后打开吃，极像我国的粽子。
    最难忘的是有一次在墨西哥总统为参加六国集团首脑会议的各国元首举行的国宴。第一道菜是汤。第二道主菜是黄澄澄的干酪裹着的半月形“馅饼”。用餐刀切开，发现里面是黑黑、软软的蘑菇状物，仔细品尝，亦不晓何物，请教邻座的主人，才知道是玉米棒上寄生的菌类，墨西哥人称之为“库依特拉科切”。后来才发现在墨西哥的菜场上就有新鲜的出售，超级市场里还有用它做的罐头。
    玉米，可以说是墨西哥人的第一食物。据统计，墨西哥农村居民所摄入的６５％热量、５０％的蛋白质，城市居民所摄入的５０％热量、４０％蛋白质均来自各种玉米食品。墨西哥的玉米播种面积占全部农作物的５４％，而每年还要进口许多玉米。有人说墨西哥又是玉米的故乡，因为是墨西哥的印第安人最早培育出了玉米。在墨西哥的博物馆里陈列着上万年前的玉米化石。在古代印第安人的图腾里，最受崇拜的诸神之一是玉米神：他粗壮的身子，像成熟、饱满的玉米，头上的神冠是３颗玉米棒。在印第安人的传说里，人与玉米像“亚当与夏娃”一样不可分离。人培育了玉米，玉米又哺育了人，人像玉米，玉米像人，他们是彼此的神灵。
    犹如稻米象征着亚洲的文明，小麦象征着欧洲的文明，由美洲印第安人最早培育出的玉米，则象征着美洲的文明。这三种文明，使人类得以生存、进步。联合国选择墨西哥建立了世界玉米小麦研究中心。在那儿，来自美国、中国、印度等国的学者，与墨西哥学者一起，正在用现代科学的手段，把古老的玉米文明发扬光大。印度学者卡里姆让我看了他的昆虫实验室。通过无数次的筛选，将要培育出一种只能人吃、昆虫受用不了的玉米新品种。中国学者韩庚辰博士领我参观了他的高产杂交玉米试验田。韩博士说，从改变种子的基因入手，可以提高玉米固有的赖氨酸含量和油含量，从而使人类利用有限的食物获得更多的营养。在这儿，古老的文明插上现代科学的翅膀，将谱写墨西哥以至全人类玉米饮食的新篇。
