	China's technology market has begun to form a network. There are more than 10,000 technology development, operation, and service institutions across the country, with last year's transaction volume reaching over 4 billion yuan. Song Jian emphasizes the need to improve the environment and establish a new order.

	According to a report by Xinhua News Agency in Beijing on January 9, multi-level, multi-form, and multi-ownership technology development, operation, and service institutions have spread throughout the country. According to incomplete statistics from the State Science and Technology Commission, China currently has more than 10,000 technology development, operation, and service institutions, doubling the number in 1985; the number of practitioners has reached nearly 300,000, including more than 150,000 scientific and technological personnel.

	China's technology market began to emerge nationwide in 1985. In that year, the national technology transaction volume reached 2.3 billion yuan. By 1988, the annual technology transaction volume had increased to over 4 billion yuan. The technology market has gradually developed and improved, with the emergence of permanent markets, specialized markets, information markets, and others. The scope of trade has also expanded, with the appearance of technology transactions in high-tech and new technology fields.

	Over the past four years, the management of the technology market has also been gradually improved. The state has issued a series of laws, regulations, and policies to adjust the order of the technology market and has used legal means to promote the prosperity and development of the technology market. In recent years, various places have strengthened the training work of the technology market, and four national training bases have been established in Shenyang, Shijiazhuang, Taishan, and Huangshan.

	According to a report by our reporter Wang Yougong, State Councilor and Minister of the State Science and Technology Commission Song Jian said in his speech at the closing ceremony of the technology market work seminar on January 8: We should make full use of the current opportunity to "improve the economic environment, rectify the economic order, and deepen the reform comprehensively" to improve the environment of the technology market and accelerate the establishment of a new order in the technology market.

	Song Jian said, science and technology are the pillars and foundations of contemporary civilization. The development of the technology market is closely related to the economic and cultural development of a place. Where the technology market is well-developed, there is hope for economic development and cultural construction. Practice has shown that the technology market is the most effective and economical means of spreading changes in people's production and living methods. He said that the central leadership pays great attention to the technology market, and all levels of leadership should strengthen their understanding of the importance of the technology market.

	Song Jian pointed out: At present, the development of China's technology market is generally healthy, but there are also some phenomena such as selling fake seeds. These negative phenomena must be seriously cleaned up and dealt with. We must strengthen the legal construction of the technology market, and the procedures such as contract registration, approval, and arbitration should gradually become standardized, thereby pushing the management work and operating mechanism of the technology market to a new stage.

	He also pointed out that the technology market should be managed by the government but not monopolized by the government. A social mechanism should be created to encourage the development of intermediary institutions that are not supported by government finance.

　　我国技术市场初具网络
    开发经营服务机构万余个去年交易额四十多亿
    宋健强调治理环境建立新秩序
    据新华社北京１月９日电  （记者姜在忠）多层次、多形式、多所有制的技术开发经营服务机构已遍布全国。据国家科委不完全统计，目前我国技术开发经营服务机构已有１万多个，比１９８５年翻了一番；从业人员已近３０万，其中科技人员有１５万多人。
    我国的技术市场是１９８５年开始在全国兴起的，当年全国技术交易金额达到２３亿元，到１９８８年，全年技术交易金额增至４０多亿元。技术市场也逐渐发育健全，出现了常设市场、专业性市场、信息市场等。贸易范围也日益扩大，出现了高技术、新技术领域的技术交易。
    ４年来，技术市场管理工作也得到了逐渐完善。国家颁布了一系列调整技术市场秩序的法律、法规和政策，运用法律手段促进了技术市场的繁荣发展。几年来各地加强了技术市场的培训工作，全国建立了沈阳、石家庄、泰山、黄山４个全国性培训基地。
    本报讯　记者王友恭报道：国务委员、国家科委主任宋健在１月８日闭幕的技术市场工作研讨会上讲话时指出：要充分利用当前“治理经济环境，整顿经济秩序，全面深化改革”的有利时机，治理技术市场环境，加快建立技术市场新秩序。
    宋健说，科学技术是当代文明的支柱和基石。技术市场的开拓和发展与当地的经济、文明发展休戚相关。哪个地方的技术市场搞的好，哪个地方的经济发展和文明建设就有希望。实践表明，技术市场是改变人们生产和生活方式最有效、最经济的传播手段。他说，中央领导对技术市场十分关心，各级领导都要加强对技术市场重要性的认识。
    宋健指出：当前，我国的技术市场发展总的说来是健康的，但也有极个别的卖假良种等现象发生。对这类不良现象要认真清理整顿，作出处理。要加强技术市场的法制建设，合同登记、批准手续、仲裁等各个程序都要逐步走上规范化，从而把技术市场的管理工作和运行机制推向新的阶段。
    他还指出，技术市场要由政府管理但又不能由政府包办，要创造一种社会机制，鼓励非政府财政支持的中介机构发展。
