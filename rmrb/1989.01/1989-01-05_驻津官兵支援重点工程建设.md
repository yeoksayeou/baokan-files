Soldiers from the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Armed Police stationed in Tianjin have actively participated in the construction of key projects in their garrison areas. Over the past two years, they have contributed more than 1.3 million man-days of labor, 110,000 vehicle and machinery operations, and moved 54,000 cubic meters of earth and stone. This has effectively promoted Tianjin's reform and opening-up, as well as the development of its commodity economy.

The troops stationed in Tianjin belong to different branches of the military. In the past, each unit operated independently in supporting local economic construction, resulting in limited cooperation and a lack of overall effectiveness. To address this issue, the Tianjin Garrison Command has taken the lead in organizing and coordinating the efforts of more than 70 regiments and battalions stationed in Tianjin. They have participated in over 10 key projects, including the construction of civil gasification, the outer ring road, the renovation of flat-roofed buildings, and the Tianjin railway hub transformation.

In the process of jointly supporting local construction, the Tianjin Garrison Command has established a joint conference system with various units to enhance coordination and cooperation.

　　驻津官兵支援重点工程建设
    本报讯  驻天津陆海空军和武警部队指战员，积极参加驻地重点工程建设，两年来投入１３０多万个劳动日，１１万多台（次）车辆机械，动用土石方５．４万立方米，有效地促进了天津改革开放和商品经济的发展。
    天津驻军分属不同的兵种。过去，各部队在支援地方经济建设中，相互联系比较少，使支援活动封闭在各自的小范围内，缺乏整体效益。为改变这种局面，近两年，天津警备区积极担负起牵头工作，组织协调驻津７０多个师、团单位的官兵先后参加了民用煤气化、外环线、平房改造、天津铁路枢纽改造等１０多项重点工程建设。在协同支援地方建设中，天津警备区与各部队协商建立了联席会议制度。
