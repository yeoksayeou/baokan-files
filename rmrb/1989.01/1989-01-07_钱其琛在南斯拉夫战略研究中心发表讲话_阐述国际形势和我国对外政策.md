Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen today morning delivered a speech titled "China's Foreign Relations in the Current International Situation" at the Yugoslav Strategic Research Center at the invitation. He elaborated on the Chinese government's views and policies on the current international situation and a series of major international issues.

In his speech, Qian first pointed out that the international situation has undergone "a turning point," and the world is now transitioning from confrontation to dialogue, from tension to relaxation. Peace and development have become the mainstream of the times. However, the significant improvement in the international situation does not mean that the world will be peaceful from now on. The competition between the U.S. and the Soviet Union has not disappeared but will continue in different forms. Regional conflicts have not been finally resolved, and the possibility of new conflicts cannot be ruled out. Efforts to maintain peace must not be relaxed in the slightest.

Qian said that strengthening unity and cooperation with the Third World developing countries is a fundamental point of China's foreign policy.

Qian said that the economic development of the Asia-Pacific region has increasingly attracted international attention, but it is too early to say that the 21st century will be the Asia-Pacific century. If China, with a population of one billion, remains in a state of development, it cannot be said to be the Asia-Pacific century. The security issue in the Asia-Pacific region is very important. Without a peaceful environment, it is impossible to develop the economy. The Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia has been exactly 10 years. If the Vietnamese authorities can follow the historical trend and decide to withdraw troops early, it will be beneficial to the peace and stability of the Indochina Peninsula and Southeast Asia.

Qian specially emphasized the Sino-Yugoslav relationship and the Non-Aligned Movement in his speech. He said that in the new international situation, the role of Sino-Yugoslav friendship is more important. Yugoslavia, as the birthplace of the Non-Aligned ideology and policy and one of the founding countries of the Non-Aligned Movement, has made positive contributions to the rise, development, and growth of the Non-Aligned Movement and plays a significant role. The ninth summit of the Non-Aligned Countries will be held in Belgrade, once again showing that Yugoslavia enjoys a high reputation in the Non-Aligned Movement and in the international arena. Qian highly evaluated the important role of the Non-Aligned Movement in international affairs and reiterated that China will closely cooperate with the Non-Aligned Movement and friendly Yugoslavia to make greater contributions to world peace and development.

Qian also elaborated on China's relations with Europe, Sino-U.S. relations, and Sino-Soviet relations in his speech.

Last night, Qian accepted an interview with a reporter from Belgrade Television, answering questions about Sino-Yugoslav bilateral relations, the ninth summit of the Non-Aligned Countries, and the Sino-Soviet summit.

　　钱其琛在南斯拉夫战略研究中心发表讲话
    阐述国际形势和我国对外政策
    本报贝尔格莱德１月６日电  记者严正报道：中国外长钱其琛今天上午应邀在南斯拉夫战略研究中心作了题为《在当前国际形势下的中国对外关系》的报告，阐述我国政府对当前国际形势和一系列重大国际问题的看法和政策。
    钱外长在报告中首先指出：国际形势已发生了“转折性的变化”，现在世界正在从对抗转向对话，由紧张转向缓和，和平与发展已成为时代的主流。但是国际形势的显著好转，并不意味着天下从此太平，美苏之间的争夺没有消失，而是将以与过去不同的形式继续下去，现在地区冲突还没有一个得到最终解决，新的冲突爆发的可能性也不能排除，维护和平的努力不能有丝毫的松懈。
    钱外长说，加强同第三世界发展中国家的团结和合作是中国对外政策一个基本立足点。
    钱外长说，亚太地区的经济发展已日益引起国际上的关注，但说２１世纪将是亚太世纪为时过早。如果拥有十亿人口的中国仍处于发展中状态，就谈不上亚太世纪。亚太地区的安全问题十分重要，没有一个和平的环境，就无法发展经济。越南发动侵柬战争已整整１０年，越南当局如能顺乎历史潮流，早下决心撤军，将会有利于印度支那和东南亚地区的和平与稳定。
    钱外长在报告中特别强调了中南关系和不结盟运动。他说，在新的国际形势下，中南友好关系的作用更加重要。南斯拉夫作为不结盟思想和政策的诞生地、不结盟运动的创始国之一，她为不结盟运动的兴起、发展和壮大作出了积极贡献，发挥着重大作用。第九届不结盟国家首脑会议将在贝尔格莱德召开，又一次表明南斯拉夫在不结盟运动中、在国际上享有很高的威望。钱外长高度评价不结盟运动在国际事务中的重大作用，再次重申中国要同不结盟运动、同友好的南斯拉夫密切合作，为世界和平与发展作出更大的贡献。
    钱外长在报告中阐述了中国与欧洲的关系、中美关系和中苏关系。
    昨天晚上，钱外长接受贝尔格莱德电视台记者采访，回答了他们提出的有关中南双边关系、第九届不结盟国家首脑会议和中苏首脑会晤等问题。
