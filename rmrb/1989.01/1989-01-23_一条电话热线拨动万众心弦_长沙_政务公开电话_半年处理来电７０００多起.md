A hotline that touches the hearts of millions
    Changsha's "Government Affairs Hotline" handles over 7,000 calls in half a year

    Xinhua News Agency reports: Around the New Year, the Changsha Municipal Government's Government Affairs Hotline received calls from residents complaining that street lighting was sometimes unreliable and that kerosene was hard to buy. Vice Mayor He Jiaxiang, after reading the "Government Affairs Hotline Digest," immediately contacted the planning department to allocate 15 tons of subsidized kerosene for residents. In the past half year, the hotline staff have handled over 7,000 calls from citizens, with 95% of the issues resolved. Residents have praised the hotline as a "heartline" connecting the government and the people.

    The city started setting up the Government Affairs Hotline in June last year. The goal was to directly hear the voices of various sectors and do their best to solve the people's problems. The city has set up 18 types of hotlines, including a comprehensive government affairs hotline, price supervision hotline, urban management hotline, and public security traffic hotline. The phone numbers are published in newspapers, and the hotline room has dedicated staff to record or respond to calls, and regularly publishes a Government Affairs Hotline bulletin. In the past, when citizens reported a problem, it often had to go through multiple levels of reporting, left and right transfers, and sometimes ended up unresolved. After the Government Affairs Hotline was set up, citizens' suggestions and opinions can be quickly reflected. From December 21 to 25 last year, 54 citizens called to report that rationed cigarettes were out of stock, and they were worried that their coupons would expire. A vice mayor immediately inquired with the relevant departments, and the goods were quickly restocked. Starting from December 26, citizens happily bought their rationed cigarettes.

    After setting up the Government Affairs Hotline, the city pays attention to screening and summarizing citizens' calls, finding out the issues that are of a general and overall nature, and providing first-hand information for scientific decision-making. In late July last year, the city experienced a rush to buy grain and oil, and for a time, the Government Affairs Hotline was ringing non-stop with strong public reactions. The municipal government immediately took emergency measures to improve the supply of planned grain and oil, deciding to simplify the grain purchase procedures and reaffirming that grain and oil prices would not rise and coupons would not expire. The buying frenzy quickly subsided.

    The Government Affairs Hotline set up by the city has also become an important channel for public supervision. Citizens can, at any time and without restraint, use the phone to boldly propose criticisms and suggestions to the municipal government and various departments. In August last year, citizens called the traffic management hotline to report that some police officers were violating traffic rules while riding motorcycles. The traffic brigade immediately held a meeting to reiterate the importance of leading by example in obeying traffic rules and dealt with five police officers who had violated the rules. On August 24 last year, citizens reported to the power supply management hotline that a young worker in the power department intentionally created a fault, causing a power outage in the Changsha Building Materials Factory area on the night of August 23. The responsible person from the municipal power bureau immediately sent someone to restore the power and personally apologized. Afterwards, three special analysis and discussion meetings were held, and the person responsible was seriously dealt with. To better utilize the Government Affairs Hotline for public supervision, the city also regularly publishes through news media the problems exposed and criticized by citizens' calls. The Changsha Evening News, Changsha Radio Station, and Changsha Television Station have set up "Government Affairs Hotline" columns and special programs, reporting 34 articles on this topic.

　　一条电话热线拨动万众心弦    
    长沙“政务公开电话”半年处理来电７０００多起
    本报讯  今年元旦前后，湖南省长沙市政府政务公开电话室接连接到居民电话，反映照明用电有时得不到保证，想买点煤油又买不到。副市长何家象看了《政务公开电话摘报》后，当即与计划部门联系，挤出１５吨平价煤油供应居民。半年来，这个市的政务公开电话值班人员接到市民电话７０００多个，其中９５％的问题得到了解决。市民反映，政务公开电话是政府和群众的“连心线”。
    这个市是从去年６月开始设立政府政务公开电话的。目的是直接听取各界呼声，尽力为群众排忧解难。全市共设立了政务综合电话、物价监督电话、市政城管电话、治安交通电话等１８类。电话号码都公诸报端，电话室有专人值班记录或答复，并定期编发政务公开电话专刊。过去群众反映一个问题，往往要层层上报，左批右转，甚至不了了之。政务公开电话设置后，群众有什么建议和意见，很快就反映上来了。去年１２月２１日至２５日，有５４名市民打电话反映凭票供应的香烟脱销，担心烟票作废。一名副市长马上向有关部门了解情况，很快调进了货源。１２月２６日起，市民们就高高兴兴地买到了凭票烟。
    这个市设立政务公开电话后，注意将群众来电筛选归纳，从中找出带倾向性、全局性的问题，为实行科学决策提供第一手资料。去年７月下旬，全市出现抢购粮油风，一时间，政务公开电话铃声不断，群众反应强烈。市政府立即采取紧急措施，改善计划粮油供应办法，决定简化购粮手续，重申粮油不涨价，票证不作废。抢购风很快平息下来了。
    这个市设立的政务公开电话，还成了群众民主监督的一个重要途径。群众可以随时随地、无拘无束地通过电话大胆地向市政府和各部门提出批评意见。去年８月，群众打电话给交通管理公开电话，反映有的民警骑摩托违章，交通支队立即开会再次强调大家要带头遵守交通规则，并处理了５名违章的民警。去年８月２４日，群众向供电管理公开电话反映电力部门的一名青工有意制造故障，使长沙建筑涂料厂一带２３日晚停电。市电业局负责人立即派人接通线路，并亲自上门道歉。事后，又开了三次专题分析讨论会，对当事人进行了严肃处理。这个市为了更好地利用政务公开电话实行群众监督，还定期通过新闻单位公布群众来电批评和揭露的问题。长沙晚报，长沙市电台、电视台设立的“政务公开电话”专栏、专题节目，报道这方面的稿件就有３４篇。
