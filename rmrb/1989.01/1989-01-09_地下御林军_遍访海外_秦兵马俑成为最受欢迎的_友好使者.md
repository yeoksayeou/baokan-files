If people were to ask: Who is the most frequent traveler to foreign countries, with the most visits and the largest number of interactions with foreigners? You might not guess that it is the "Underground Imperial Guards" of Qin Shi Huang—the Terracotta Army. These clay soldiers have visited more than ten countries and regions, "meeting" over 7 million people from various countries.

The Terracotta Army, which had been buried underground for over two thousand years, was accidentally discovered in 1974 when local farmers were digging a well. This discovery shocked the world and earned it the title of the "Eighth Wonder of the World." Apart from being displayed in the original site museum, starting from 1980, these clay soldiers have been sent abroad in groups, becoming the most welcomed "ambassadors of friendship" overseas.

People from all over the world have shown great enthusiasm and interest in this Qin Dynasty "expeditionary force." Even disabled individuals in wheelchairs have eagerly lined up to see them, and some blind people were specially allowed to touch the statues, feeling greatly honored. During the exhibition in Norway, the king, who had never attended any exhibition opening ceremony before, made an exception and attended the opening ceremony of the Terracotta Army exhibition along with the prime minister. When the Terracotta Army arrived in Sweden, citizens of the capital Stockholm braved temperatures below zero and stood in line for dozens of minutes in the snow to enter the exhibition. Neighboring countries like Finland, Denmark, and Iceland had thousands of people braving the cold and crossing the sea to visit the exhibition. Many parents with children said after the visit: "Not a single child failed to vow to visit China when they grow up."

In the eyes of audiences worldwide, the Terracotta Army is the "symbol of ancient Chinese civilization." The governor of Hokkaido, Japan, Horiji Takahiro, told reporters: "What surprised me most is the size and quantity of the Terracotta Army. The lifelike expressions and delicate carvings possess timeless beauty. At the same time, it makes one feel that the people of the Qin Dynasty, who had just unified China, were so full of vigor and vitality."

The overseas exhibitions of the Terracotta Army have sparked a huge response among overseas Chinese, ethnic Chinese, and compatriots from Hong Kong and Taiwan. An elderly Chinese immigrant in the United States gathered all four generations of his family, a total of 46 people, and traveled 100 kilometers by train to visit the exhibition. With tears in his eyes, he told the accompanying personnel, "We are all descendants of the Yellow Emperor. Our ancestors are truly great."

　　“地下御林军”遍访海外
    秦兵马俑成为最受欢迎的“友好使者”
    据新华社西安１月８日电  （记者王兆麟）如果人们要问：当今中国出访海外国家最多，次数最频，接触海外人士数量最大的使者是谁？那你或许不会想到：竟是秦始皇的“地下御林军”——兵马俑。这些陶质将士迄今已出访十多个国家、地区，“会见”各国人士累计７００多万人次。
    在地下沉睡了两千多年的秦始皇陵兵马俑，由于１９７４年春当地农民抗旱打井这个偶然的机缘，得以出土问世，顿时震惊中外，被誉为“世界第八大奇迹”。它们除在原地建馆展出外，从１９８０年起还派出一支支“小分队”遍访海外，成为最受海外公众欢迎的“友好使者”。
    世界各国人民对于这支秦代“远征军”显示出极大的热情和兴趣，包括坐轮椅的残疾人都纷纷前去先睹为快，一些盲人被特许抚摸了俑身而感到极大的荣幸。在挪威展出时，过去从未参加过任何展览会开幕式的国王破例和首相同时出席了秦俑展的开幕式。秦俑来到瑞典，首都斯德哥尔摩市民冒着零下十多度的严寒，在风雪中排队几十分钟等候入场。邻近的芬兰、丹麦、冰岛等国，数千人冒着风雪，渡海专程前往参观。许多带孩子的家长参观后说：没有一个孩子不发誓说长大后要去中国的。
    在世界各国观众的心目中，秦俑是“中国古代文明的象征”。日本北海道知事横路孝弘对记者说：“特别使我惊奇的是兵马俑造型之大、数量之多。那栩栩如生的表情，细腻的刻画，具有超时代的美。同时还令人感到统一中国不久的秦代人，是那么朝气勃勃，充满活力。”
    秦俑在海外展出，在华侨、华裔和港台同胞中引起了巨大反响。有一位旅美老华侨，把全家祖孙四代４６人召集到一起，从１００公里外乘火车前往参观，他含着热泪对我随展人员说：“我们都是炎黄子孙，我们的祖先太伟大了。”
