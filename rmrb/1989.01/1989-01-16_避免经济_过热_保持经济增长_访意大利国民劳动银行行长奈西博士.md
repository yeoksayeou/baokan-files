Avoiding Economic "Overheating" and Maintaining Economic Growth
— An Interview with Dr. Nerio Nesi, President of the Italian National Labor Bank

By Luo Jintiao, People's Daily Correspondent

In 1988, the Italian economy achieved significant development for the fifth consecutive year. The gross domestic product increased by 3.6% in real terms compared to the previous year, the inflation rate was controlled at 5%, employment increased, and there was no economic "overheating." How did Italy achieve this? The reporter interviewed Dr. Nerio Nesi, President of the largest banking group in Italy, the Italian National Labor Bank.

Dr. Nesi first discussed Italy's historical experience in solving the problem of economic "overheating." He said that the root causes of the economic "overheating" that have occurred in recent decades are manifold. First, there is the lack of flexibility in the production mechanism, which leads to problems in the cost structure of products. Second, there is the backwardness of the commodity sales system. Additionally, there is the issue of inflation. To address these problems, the government adopted measures to control demand. The specific measures can be summarized as follows:

Increasing indirect taxes, specifically value-added tax (VAT), and reducing personal income tax. The VAT system implemented in Italy was introduced in 1973 in accordance with EEC directives. This tax is levied at every stage of the commodity exchange process, but the final consumers ultimately bear the burden. The sellers of goods and services are not affected by this tax; they merely act as tax collectors, remitting the VAT to the state. Last year, Italy made two significant adjustments to the VAT. In July, the standard VAT rate for general economic transactions was increased from 18% to 19%. By the end of the year, the minimum VAT rate (particularly for widely consumed food items) was increased from 2% to 4%, and items previously exempt from VAT, such as books and newspapers, were also taxed at 4%. At the same time, personal income tax rates were significantly reduced, with the highest rate dropping from 62% to 50% and the lowest rate from 12% to 10%.

Using monetary and credit tools. On one hand, interest rates were raised to cool down corporate credit; on the other hand, "credit ceilings" were established, limiting the maximum amount banks could lend each month. This practice was implemented from 1973 and lasted for about 10 years.

Implementing a special policy known as the "income policy." This policy involves intervening in the wage levels of workers and the prices of industrial products to control inflation. Specific measures include: abolishing the mechanism that automatically links wages to the inflation rate; "taxing social welfare fees," where Italian enterprises must transfer certain welfare benefits for their employees to a state agency, which then treats them as corporate tax payments; and establishing "subsidy funds," where the state pays the wages of excess employees in enterprises to avoid mass layoffs.

Dr. Nesi believes that the Italian economy, which has been growing continuously in recent years, currently does not face the danger of "overheating." When discussing how to achieve balanced economic growth without inflation, he believes that this requires the enormous flexibility of the processing industry, the extensive adoption of advanced technology, a flexible labor market, and a reasonable and modern commodity sales system.

　　避免经济“过热”　保持经济增长
    ——访意大利国民劳动银行行长奈西博士
    本报记者  罗晋标
    １９８８年，意大利经济连续第５年取得较大发展，国内生产总值比上年实际增长３．６％，通胀率控制在５％，就业有所增加，且未发生经济“过热现象”。意大利究竟在这方面是怎么做的？记者就此采访了意大利最大的银行集团——意大利国民劳动银行行长奈里奥·奈西博士。
    奈西博士首先谈到意大利解决经济“过热”问题的历史经验。他说，最近数十年来曾经出现过的经济“过热”现象的根源有多种，首先是生产机制缺乏灵活性而造成的产品成本结构问题；其次是商品销售系统落后；还有就是通胀问题的出现等。对此，政府采取了控制需求的办法。其具体措施可概括为以下几方面：
    增加间接税即增值税，降低公民所得税。意大利所实行的增值税是１９７３年按欧共体有关指令引进的。这种税收贯穿在商品交换的每一个环节，但真正承担这种税收的是最后消费者，而出售商品和劳务的经营者并不受这种税收的影响，只是起着收税机关的作用，把增值税款上交给国家。去年，意大利曾两次对增值税作重要调整。７月份把一般经济交换中实行的普通增值税从１８％提高到１９％。年底又把最低增值税（尤其涉及广泛消费的食品）从２％提高到４％，并把原来免收增值税的书报等商品也征收４％。同时，明显降低了所得税，最高所得税率从６２％降为５０％，最低所得税率从１２％降至１０％。
    运用货币和信贷手段。一方面提高利率，给企业的信贷降温；另一方面，制定“信贷限额”，规定银行每个月放款的最高限额。这种做法从１９７３年起前后实行了１０年。
    实行一种特殊的政策，即所谓“收入政策”。这种政策是干预劳动者的工资水平和工业产品价格，以控制物价上涨。采取的具体措施有：取消工资同通货膨胀率自动挂钩的机制；“社会福利费税收化”，意大利企业须将其职工享受的某些福利费交给国家一个主管机构，“税收化”后，国家即把它充作企业缴纳的税收；设立“补助基金”，即企业中过量的职工的工资由国家支付，以免大量裁员。
    奈西博士认为，近年连续增长的意大利经济目前不存在“过热”的危险。在谈到怎样才能取得没有通货膨胀的经济平衡增长时，他认为，这要靠加工工业部门的巨大灵活性，大量地采用先进技术；同时还必须有灵活的劳务市场和合理的现代化的商品销售系统。
