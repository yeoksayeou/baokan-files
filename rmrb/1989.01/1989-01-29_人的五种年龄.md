The Five Ages of a Person

    The calendar age of people increases equally with the passage of time, regardless of how well you take care of yourself or how much you understand about life. In the face of the passage of calendar years, everyone's time is "helplessly falling away."

    The apparent age of individuals can vary greatly even if their calendar ages are the same, due to differences in genetic factors and subsequent care.

    People's physiological ages are not necessarily the same. Some people age prematurely and are plagued by illnesses; others remain vigorous and youthful.

    People are not equal in terms of their psychological age. Some young people have old psychological qualities, being dull, conservative, and rigid; some people, even in their twilight years, retain their childlike innocence, are wisely confused, and have the spirit of "an old steed ready to gallop a thousand miles."

    Social age is proportional to one's accumulated experience, knowledge, and abilities. Some people, though advanced in years, act childishly; others, though young, are shrewd and experienced. Being active, having rich experience, being knowledgeable, talented, eloquent, profound in thought, and resourceful are signs of a high social age.

　　人的五种年龄
    日历年龄：人们的日历年龄随着时间的消逝均等地增长着，不管你如何善于保养，也无论你怎样懂生活，在日历年龄的增长面前，任何人的岁月都是“无可奈何花落去”的。
    外貌年龄：由于遗传因素和后天保养的差异，日历年龄相同的人其外貌年龄也会大不相同。
    生理年龄：人们的生理年龄不一定相同，有些人未老先衰，百病缠身；有些人则宝刀不老，青春常驻。
    心理年龄：人们在心理年龄面前并不是平等的。有些年轻人，其心理品质却老得很，迟钝、保守、僵化；有些人即使到了垂暮之年也童心未泯，难得糊涂，“老骥伏枥，志在千里”。
    社会年龄：社会年龄是与人们的经验、知识和才能的积累成比例的。有些人年纪一大把办起事来却幼稚可笑；有些人则“人小鬼大”，老谋深算。活动广泛，经验丰富，知识渊博，才华横溢，能言善辩，思想深刻，足智多谋是社会年龄高的标志。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（１月１日《甘肃日报》 路程文）
