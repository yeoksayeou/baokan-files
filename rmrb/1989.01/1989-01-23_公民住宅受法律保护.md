A residence is where a citizen lives and rests. Illegally entering someone else's residence will inevitably affect their personal safety and peace of life.

During the ten years of turmoil, the "rebels" could use the pretext of "destroying the four olds" to search citizens' homes at will, occupy private residences, and take away citizens' property. Who dared to resist with reason? Where could one go to file a complaint and seek justice?

Today, our country's legal system is increasingly complete, and citizens' personal rights and democratic rights are given due attention and protection by the state. The law explicitly prohibits illegal entry into others' residences, and those who violate this will be held legally responsible. This is of great significance for ensuring citizens' personal safety and maintaining social order.

In daily life, cases of illegal entry into others' residences, and even arbitrarily searching and taking others' property, often arise from civil disputes. When such problems cannot be resolved through mediation, persuasion, education, and other means, one might as well remind those who illegally enter others' residences: "Citizen, illegally entering others' residences will land you in court."

　　公民住宅受法律保护
    荣处仁
    住宅，是公民居注生活、休息的场所。非法侵入他人住宅，必然会影响他人的人身安全与生活安宁。
    十年动乱期间，“造反派”可以以“破四旧”为名，随便抄公民的家，随便进驻他人私宅，随便拿走公民财物，谁敢以理抗争？又到哪里告状伸冤？
    时至今日，我国法制日益健全，公民的人身权利和民主权利受到国家应有的重视和保护。法律明文规定禁止非法侵入他人住宅，对违反者要追究法律责任。这对保障公民人身安全，维护社会秩序，具有重要意义。
    在日常生活中，由民间纠纷引起的非法侵入他人住宅，甚至随意抄拿他人财物的案件时有发生，在通过调解、劝阻、说服、教育仍不能解决问题时，不妨向非法侵入他人住宅者提醒一句：“公民，非法侵入他人住宅是要吃官司的。”
