	Hunger, Cold, and War Threaten Kabul
	Diplomatic Missions Withdraw; Tens of Thousands of Refugees Flee
	Afghan Resistance Forces Delay Consultative Conference

	BEIJING, January 23 — According to local newspapers and foreign news agencies, due to severe shortages of food and fuel, elderly people and children in Kabul have died from cold and hunger. Residents are fleeing to escape the danger, and diplomatic missions are also withdrawing en masse.

	Because the resistance forces and unprecedented heavy snow have blocked the roads leading to Kabul, the situation in the city has further deteriorated. Hunger and cold are threatening most of the residents. Reports indicate that some frail elderly people and children have already died from cold and hunger. Many schools have been closed, and Kabul University has been suspended for nearly a month due to the inability to provide heating. All personnel from the West German embassy have withdrawn, and the British embassy is also preparing to withdraw.

	As the situation in Kabul worsens and the fighting in Nangarhar intensifies, more than 20,000 refugees have flooded into Pakistan in the past month. According to Pakistani officials responsible for refugee affairs, half of these refugees are children.

	BEIJING, January 23 — According to a report from the Pakistani newspaper *Muslim*, the seven-party alliance based in Peshawar and the eight-party alliance based in Iran have differing opinions on the allocation of seats in the upcoming consultative assembly. The consultative assembly, originally scheduled for February 1, has been postponed to around February 10.

	Previously, the seven-party alliance and the eight-party alliance held two rounds of negotiations and agreed to convene the consultative assembly before the complete withdrawal of Soviet troops to form a broad-based united government. The consultative assembly consists of 480 members. The seven-party alliance's proposal is that each of the seven parties nominates 60 people, totaling 420, with the remaining 60 seats reserved for the eight-party alliance. However, the eight-party alliance demands that the seats representing Afghan Shia Muslims should be at least 120.

	The seven-party alliance has decided to send a high-level delegation to Iran again, on one hand to seek support from the Iranian government, and on the other hand to further negotiate with the eight-party alliance on the issue of seats in the consultative assembly.

　　饥饿、寒冷和战乱威胁喀布尔    
    外交使团撤离　数万难民逃亡    
    阿抵抗力量推迟召开协商会议
    本报伊斯兰堡１月２３日电  记者任毓骏报道：据此地报纸和外电报道，由于食品和燃料严重短缺，喀布尔已有老人和儿童因冻饿而死，居民外逃避难，外交使团也纷纷撤离。
    由于抵抗力量和多年未见的大雪封锁了通往喀布尔的道路，喀布尔市内局势进一步恶化，饥饿和寒冷威胁着大部分市民。据报道，一些体弱的老人和儿童已被冻饿而死，许多学校已关闭，喀布尔大学因无法供暖已停课近一个月。联邦德国使馆人员已全部撤离，英国使馆也在作撤离的准备。
    随着喀布尔形势恶化和楠格哈尔战事日益紧张，近一个多月来已有２万余名难民涌入巴基斯坦。据负责难民事务的巴基斯坦官员说，这些难民有一半是儿童。
    本报伊斯兰堡１月２３日电　记者任毓骏报道：据巴基斯坦《穆斯林报》今天消息，以白瓦沙为基地的阿富汗抵抗力量七党联盟和以伊朗为基地的八党联盟在未来协商性议会席位分配上意见发生矛盾，原定２月１日召开的协商性议会推迟到大约２月１０日左右召开。
    前些时候，七党联盟和八党联盟经过两轮谈判，同意在苏联完全撤军前召开协商性议会，以便组建基础广泛的联合政府。协商性议会由４８０名成员组成。七党联盟的方案是，７党中每党提名６０人共４２０名，其余６０名留给八党联盟。而八党联盟的要求是，代表阿富汗什叶派穆斯林的席位至少应有１２０名。
    七党联盟已开会决定，派一个高级代表团再次去伊朗，一方面寻求伊朗政府的支持，另一方面与八党联盟就协商性议会的席位问题作进一步会谈。
