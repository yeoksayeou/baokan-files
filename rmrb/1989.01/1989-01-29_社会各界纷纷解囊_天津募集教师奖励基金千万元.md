Various sectors of society have generously contributed to raise a million yuan for Tianjin teachers' reward fund. By January 20, Tianjin had collected 1,057 million yuan for the primary and secondary school teachers' reward fund. This achievement has been highly praised by the China Primary and Secondary School Teachers' Reward Fund and its chairman, Wang Zhen.

The primary and secondary school teachers' reward fund is established to commend outstanding teachers, enhance their social status, promote societal concern and support for education, and advance the development of China's basic education. In Tianjin, this work has first received the support of the leadership. When the fund was established, leaders such as Li Ruihuan each donated 100 yuan. Many entrepreneurs and artists also contributed generously. The staff of the Municipal Party Committee, Municipal People's Congress, Municipal Government, and Municipal Political Consultative Conference actively donated funds. Tianjin also utilized social media to widely publicize the campaign, effectively promoting the citywide individual and social group donations to support teachers.

It is understood that the Tianjin Primary and Secondary School Teachers' Reward Fund will use 1.5 million yuan of the fund's interest to reward 10,000 outstanding teachers on this year's Teachers' Day, aiming to create a good atmosphere of respecting teachers and honoring the teaching profession throughout society.

    天津募集教师奖励基金千万元
    新华社天津１月２８日电（记者朱玉泉）截至１月２０日，天津市中小学幼儿教师奖励基金已经募集到１０５７万元。这一成绩得到中国中小学幼儿教师奖励基金会及王震理事长的高度评价。
    中小学幼儿教师奖励基金是为表彰优秀教师、提高他们的社会地位，推动全社会关心和支持教育，促进我国基础教育事业的发展而设立的。在天津，这一工作首先得到了领导机关的支持。基金会成立之初，李瑞环等负责同志分别捐款百元，一些企业家、艺术家也纷纷解囊。市委、市人大、市政府、市政协的机关干部也积极捐款。天津市还利用社会舆论广泛宣传，有效地推动了全市个人和社会集团捐款助教活动。
    据悉，天津市中小学幼儿教师奖励基金会将在今年教师节用基金的１５０万元利息奖励万名优秀教师，以期在全社会创造一个尊师重教、从教光荣的良好风气。
