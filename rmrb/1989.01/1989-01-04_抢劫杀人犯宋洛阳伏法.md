    Armed robbery and murderer Song Luoyang executed
    A report from our newspaper: On December 28 last year, the Intermediate People's Court of Luoyang City, Henan Province, held a sentencing meeting and announced that the principal offender in the armed robbery and murder case, Song Luoyang, was sentenced to death and deprived of political rights for life; co-defendant Zhang Xiuhua (female) was sentenced to life imprisonment and deprived of political rights for life; accomplice Gao Hongrun was sentenced to 20 years in prison and deprived of political rights for 5 years. After the meeting, Song Luoyang was executed according to law.

    On the night of September 4 last year, around 11 PM, Song Luoyang, a young worker who had been expelled from the Luoyang Single Crystal Silicon Factory, along with Zhang Xiuhua, a young female worker who had been expelled from the Luoyang Cotton Textile Mill, carried a hand grenade, a handgun, and a homemade dagger. They rode bicycles to the family compound of the Tangcun Substation of the Luoyang Power Supply Bureau, where they entered the home of Han Qiming. Song Luoyang claimed to be a public security officer and pulled out his handgun to threaten Han. When Han's wife, Fu Xuefang, called for help, Song shot and killed her. Han Qiming shouted for help, and a neighbor, Liang Xiaojing, a technician from the Henan Diesel Engine Factory, rushed over to fight with Song. Song stabbed Liang in the left waist and left elbow with the dagger. Zhang Xiuhua took out a hand grenade with the cover removed and smashed it at Liang. During the struggle between Han Qiming and Zhang Xiuhua, the hand grenade exploded, injuring Han's legs in six places. The two criminals then fled the scene. The next morning, Song Luoyang and Zhang Xiuhua, with the help of Gao Hongrun, a young worker from the Luoyang Cotton Textile Mill, were attempting to escape when they were captured by officers from the Luoyang Public Security Bureau and the Jianxi Public Security Sub-bureau.

    On November 9 last year, the Intermediate People's Court of Luoyang City handed down the first-instance verdict in this case. Song Luoyang and Zhang Xiuhua appealed to the Higher People's Court of Henan Province. On November 29, the Higher People's Court of Henan Province rejected the appeal and upheld the original verdict.

　　抢劫杀人犯宋洛阳伏法
    本报讯  去年１２月２８日，河南省洛阳市中级人民法院召开宣判大会，宣布判处持枪抢劫杀人案主犯宋洛阳死刑，剥夺政治权利终身；判处同案犯张秀凤（女）无期徒刑，剥夺政治权利终身；判处包庇犯高宏运２０年徒刑、剥夺政治权利５年。会后宋洛阳被依法处决。
    去年９月４日晚１１时许，被洛阳市单晶硅厂开除厂籍的青年工人宋洛阳伙同被洛阳棉纺织厂除名的青年女工张秀凤，携带手榴弹一枚、手枪一支、自制尖刀一把，骑自行车窜到洛阳市供电局唐村变电站家属院韩启明家。宋洛阳自称是公安人员，并掏出手枪威胁。当韩启明妻子傅雪芳呼救时，宋洛阳开枪将傅雪芳打死。韩启明大声呼救，同院邻居、河南柴油机厂技术员梁晓京闻声赶来与宋洛阳搏斗。宋用尖刀将梁左腰部、左肘部刺伤。张秀凤掏出已经揭开盖的手榴弹向梁晓京猛砸。韩启明与张秀凤搏斗时手榴弹爆炸，韩双腿被炸伤６处，二犯逃离现场。翌日上午，宋洛阳、张秀凤在洛阳棉纺织厂青年工人高宏运协助其逃跑时，被洛阳市公安局和涧西公安分局干警抓获。
    洛阳市中级人民法院于去年１１月９日对此案作出一审判决，宋洛阳、张秀凤等不服，上诉河南省高级人民法院。１１月２９日，河南省高级人民法院驳回上诉，维持原判。
