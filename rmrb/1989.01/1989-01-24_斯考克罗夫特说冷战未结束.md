U.S. National Security Advisor Scowcroft said on the 22nd in an interview with a television reporter that the Cold War has not ended, but the cessation of hostility is in sight.

Scowcroft said that the reason Soviet leader Gorbachev launched a diplomatic offensive is that he needs a period of stability to solve domestic problems and to create divisions in Europe. Therefore, there is still a possibility of renewed tension between the U.S. and the Soviet Union.

Scowcroft expressed reservations about the Reagan administration's policy on arms reduction and hinted that the Bush administration might make some modifications to the arms reduction proposals put forward by Reagan to the Soviet Union.

　　斯考克罗夫特说冷战未结束
    美国总统国家安全顾问斯考克罗夫特二十二日在接受电视台记者采访时说，冷战并没有结束，但是停止敌对已经在望。
    斯考克罗夫特说，苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫之所以发动外交攻势，是因为他需要一段稳定的时间来解决国内问题和想在欧洲制造分裂。因此，美苏之间仍有可能再次出现紧张局面。
    斯考克罗夫特表示，他对里根政府在裁军问题上的政策持保留态度，并暗示布什政府可能会对里根向苏提出的裁军建议作某些修改。
