This is the first major art history tome in our country, and it is also the most comprehensive, systematic, and extensive art history work to date, covering six categories: painting history, sculpture history, architectural art history, printmaking history, calligraphy and seal engraving history, and craft art history, totaling over 2.5 million words.

    ● A zinc oxide varistor, capable of preventing televisions and refrigerators from being damaged due to unstable voltage, has been successfully developed by Shandong University and is now in mass production.

The members of this center are a group of young and middle-aged teachers from the university who have shown great promise. The center will conduct comprehensive research on important issues in the development of contemporary China and the world from social, historical, political, legal, economic, religious, and technological perspectives, and provide decision-making consultations.

    ● A granite statue of Cai Lun, the inventor of papermaking, was recently unveiled at the paper mill in Lanxi City, Zhejiang Province. This statue was meticulously crafted by Professor Wang Zhuoyu, an old professor from the Sculpture Department of the Zhejiang Academy of Fine Arts.
