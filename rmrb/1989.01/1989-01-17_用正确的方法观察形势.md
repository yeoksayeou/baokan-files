Everyone is concerned about the situation and discussing the situation. The faculty, staff, and students of our universities should have a higher-level understanding and analysis of the situation. We should observe society and analyze the situation from a historical and global perspective. Through the analysis and discussion of the situation, we can invigorate our spirits, strengthen our reform consciousness and participation consciousness, and enhance our sense of social responsibility.

Situation education, which has been formed over the past 30 years, is no longer appealing to people. Therefore, the content, methods, and approaches of situation education should also be reformed. We should improve our observational skills through discussions and come up with new ideas and concepts. We should not only improve our own level of understanding but also contribute to society.

The situation is broad and includes economic, political, ideological, and international situations, among others. I will mainly discuss the ideological situation, touching on some economic situations and theoretical concepts.

Regarding people's discussions, complaints, folk songs, and rhymes, we should analyze them specifically and not simply use "old ideas" to silence people.

Let's start with the national mentality.

Since this spring, there have been many discussions and complaints among the people. There are also many folk songs and rhymes. How should we view and analyze them? There is a lot to ponder here.

According to my observations, public opinions and complaints can be roughly divided into five categories.

First, due to the existence of corruption in party and government agencies, the public has opinions and complaints. Except for a few irresponsible rumors, we should seriously listen to this type of opinion. In many cases, it reflects the public's changing ideas and increased awareness. It also shows that the atmosphere of socialist democracy is becoming thicker. This is an important form of public supervision and public opinion supervision. Therefore, the central government has taken decisive measures to rectify corruption.

Second, due to decision-making errors or shortcomings in work, the public has opinions and discussions. This shows that the public's sense of participation is increasing, which is a good phenomenon. We should seriously listen to the public's criticisms and suggestions, improve the government's decision-making procedures, and improve government work.

The third category is not a work problem or a style of work problem, but rather a lack of transparency and a lack of two-way information transmission, causing the public to misunderstand the true situation. The solution is to increase transparency and improve our information transmission work.

The fourth category is due to the adjustment of the interest structure during the reform of the old system, causing some people's mental imbalance, thus generating grievances, complaints, and folk songs.

The fifth category is an ideological concept problem. Due to outdated ideas, some people find it difficult to accept and are not used to some new things in the reform and opening up; they view the negative phenomena in the social, economic, and cultural fields with old ideas, and the more they look, the more serious they seem. Therefore, there are many opinions and complaints. Some of the content of the folk songs clearly reflects the outdated ideas.

However, in dealing with ideological issues, there are two points to note. First, we should not use "old ideas" to silence people as soon as we hear their opinions; second, we should not say that only you have outdated ideas, and I have no outdated ideas, and I am educating you. We must not do this. Therefore, I advocate that everyone should discuss the situation equally.

Now is the real time to show the power and value of ideological and political work. Political workers should not have a sense of loss.

What is the relationship between the above five opinions and complaints?

According to my observations, they are not isolated or like building blocks, but rather a mixed type. Often, corruption and price increases are the "trigger points," and they are linked in ideological issues, forming a contradiction and a confusion. That is, the discussions, grievances, and complaints caused by the influence of old ideas are numerous and widespread. This poses a challenge to our ideological and political work. Helping people change their ideas is an urgent task and an important part of the current situation education. In other words, the so-called situation education should start from "here." In this fundamental sense, the current era is a time that calls for thinkers. The content of ideological and political work, theoretical work, and even the teaching and research work of our liberal arts departments has never been as rich and interesting as it is now. Imagine, how many social, political, economic, and cultural issues need our ideological and political workers and theoretical workers to think about and answer? This is the real time to show the power and value of ideological and political work. We should treat it as a systematic project to study. This is a both arduous and noble cause. How can political workers have a "sense of loss"? They really should not!

How should we observe the situation?

Based on my personal experience, there should be four standards.

First, observe the situation with the standard of productive forces. This requires a comparative perspective. But the purpose of comparison is not to make people "content," but to invigorate the spirit and increase confidence.

I do not want to list statistics, as they are dull. Let's start with the facts that we can see and experience from our own "practical lives."

Our reform is said to have lasted ten years. But the economic system reform actually only has five years. In the five years after the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, the whole country was mainly engaged in rectifying the chaos and implementing policies. Of course, this is also a reform. The family contract system in rural areas was widely promoted in 1983, and the urban reform pilot in 1984. Five years of reform have made our country enter the best period in its history in terms of politics and economy. Productive forces have rapidly developed, and the appearance of cities and villages has undergone tremendous changes. From the perspective of productive forces, we are justified in observing the situation. Take our familiar Shenyang as an example. What was it like ten years ago? Five years ago? And what is it like today? In 1983, when I returned to Shenyang from abroad, it was like returning from a city to a village. But this year, when I returned from abroad again, there was not such a big difference. Now, when we receive foreign guests at our university, we always arrange for them to tour the cityscape because now there is something to see. From the perspective of people's lives, although there are still thousands of people in remote areas whose basic needs are not fully met, the living standards of the vast majority of people have greatly improved. Clothing, food, housing, and transportation have all improved, albeit to different degrees. Ten years ago, when you walked to the staff housing area of our university after work, you could hear the sound of chopping vegetables from afar. Were they chopping stuffing for dumplings? No, the teachers were chopping chicken feed. At that time, the "specialty" of the university canteen was corn cakes; breakfast and dinner were corn porridge. Now, the clothing, food, and daily necessities of university students are much better than those of teachers ten years ago! In the 1960s and 1970s, it was so hard for people from Liaoning to travel to Beijing. Pork, noodles, washing powder... everything had to be carried. They were called "Northeast Tigers." Now this hat has been removed!

Some people say that the era of low wages was not as chaotic as now. But do not forget that it was maintained by strong control measures. Economically, there was a shortage of materials, so tickets were issued. According to statistics, there were as many as 77 types of nationwide tickets in the 1970s. Liaoning had even more. In 1975, a teacher from the Chinese Department told me that illiterates could not eat in the staff canteen of Liaoning University. Because he could not understand the various tickets. Grain tickets were divided into national grain tickets and local grain tickets, and local grain tickets were divided into provincial and municipal grain tickets; when exchanging for meal tickets at the canteen, they were divided into coarse grain tickets and fine grain tickets; fine grain tickets were further divided into rice tickets and flour tickets... At that time, there was also a "theory" that this was planned supply. In fact, it was a rationing system. Even it was said that this was a distribution according to needs, "with elements of communism." At that time, who discussed it? Politically, a concept made a group of people obedient. "Bourgeois intellectuals" - a large group of people became obedient; then the concept of "capitalist roaders in power" was proposed, and another large group of people became obedient. Some people say that recently some commodities have tickets again. Yes. But this is different from the past. First, it is not a general shortage of materials, but only a few varieties. Either it is caused by a buying frenzy, or it is due to a lack of raw materials. Second, the public has been openly informed that this is a quota or limited supply, which is temporary. It is realistic.

In short, from the perspective of productive forces, our country has indeed developed, prospered, and progressed, and the living standards of the people have improved.

Second, observe the situation with the standard of reform, opening up, and commodity economy. From the perspective of product economy, it is now "chaotic." But from the perspective of the new commodity economy, we can see our progress and development, and we can also correctly view the existing problems. Reform and opening up have brought unprecedented vitality to our country. Some negative phenomena in society are not brought by the commodity economy, but are precisely caused by the underdevelopment of the commodity economy. Commodity economy is a credit economy, but we now have many counterfeit goods. From the perspective of reform and opening up, it will be enlightening. For example, the problem of unfair distribution, where is the main unfairness? A nation does not fear earning more money, but fears earning money easily. Now some people earn money easily. Why did a small merchant in the old society only feed his family, but now he can become rich? It is precisely because there are too many loopholes in the old system. At present, there are loopholes to exploit, no equal competition, plus "official speculation." The more you do not reform and open up, the more opportunities you will create for the rich. In the early years, speculating on peanuts could make you rich, but now it is not possible. From the perspective of reform, opening up, and commodity economy, it will enhance our belief in reform and correctly view some negative phenomena. For many years, there has been a traditional practice of finding the cause of problems in ideology, called a revolution in the depths of the soul. I suggest that comrades read two books: Marx's "Critique of Political Economy" and "The German Ideology." Any social phenomenon can be found in economic relations.

Third, observe and analyze the situation with the perspective of dialectical and historical materialism. Although this is an old saying, after reflection, it was not done in the past, and a large number of problems were viewed with idealist metaphysical perspectives. For various reasons, people have formed a cultural psychological structure that is simple, one-sided, and absolute. We must overcome this abnormal psychology. Things are complex, interconnected, and changing, so using isolated, one-sided, and static perspectives to view problems will not lead to correct conclusions. For example, the grain problem, should the grain procurement price be raised, and should the sales price be raised? Raising the sales price will make the people have opinions, and the state has to adopt the method of subsidies. Poland could not afford the subsidies and caused riots. In recent years, our dark subsidies have not decreased but increased. If we look at the situation comprehensively and developmentally, we will be calm, we will understand the government's difficulties, and we will enhance our sense of social responsibility. We should cultivate the character of being responsible to people and society. This is an important part of our talent cultivation.

Fourth, observe the situation, society, and the history of socialist practice with the perspective of a great experiment: mistakes are inevitable, and the way out is in reform.

I do not agree with finding the way out too much from the personal morality or personal responsibility of leaders. This way, isn't it that when an idol fails, you condemn it and then put your hopes on a new idol? This is not the perspective of historical materialism. My opinion is to focus on dissecting the systemic defects, because the idol itself is created by the system. In this way, historical wealth can be summarized, which is beneficial for people to correctly view history and today's situation; it can also enhance people's reform consciousness and find the answers to "why reform, what to reform, and how to reform."

Observing the situation with the perspective of a great experiment is to reflect on the history of socialist practice. Reflection, focusing on one point, is how to view socialism. For many years, in the issue of socialism, people have not been able to get rid of the contradiction between idealism and science, fantasy and reality. Often using moral standards to view socialism, "doing" socialism. Everything wants to be "cut in half," everything starts from scratch, everything "goes against." Seeking fairness, purity, and speed. As a result, we suffered a big loss. Recently, I watched the Taiwanese TV series "Stars of Yesterday," which gave me a lot of inspiration. It describes a group of contradictions, which are solved and digested by a word - "filial piety," without causing social problems. This is a typical example of Chinese traditional culture. But in the past, we criticized and completely denied all of these. In economic issues, there are even more such lessons.

The economic and social problems we encounter today, many are old diseases recurring. Such as inflation, overheating of construction, buildings and halls; such as the loss of control of social group purchasing power, and vicious competition in the distribution and consumption fields, etc. These "old diseases" are acting up today, with today's work problems and today's loss of control and management chaos. We cannot push all the responsibility to "yesterday." But it is also undeniable that the "root of the disease" is in yesterday, in the systemic defects of yesterday. Why has the wind of building buildings and halls not been stopped for more than 30 years? The root cause is that we do not have property rights constraints. Therefore, to fundamentally solve this kind of problem, the way out is in reform. Reform our planned management system, reform the employment system and property rights system.

First, how to view economic prosperity and negative phenomena. Last spring, I thought of a topic, which is "prosperity and evil" (evil refers to negative phenomena, the same below). People often start from their wishes, wanting prosperity but not evil. So, when they see some negative phenomena in social and economic life, they have a strong feeling of "not as good as before." The more they look, the more serious they seem, and the more angry they become, and thus they complain a lot. Even doubting the effect and "direction" of reform and opening up. Historical experience is worth noting. For many years, we have been "thinking" about socialism and "doing" socialism in this way. What was the result? It was a word: poor. In fact, poverty is the greatest evil. Socialism is to eliminate poverty. However, in the process of economic development, in the process of commodity economy development, the simplicity of an agricultural society will inevitably disappear, and some negative phenomena will follow. Only when productive forces develop to a higher level, as Marx said, "great development and high growth," can evil be eliminated. Our responsibility is to minimize it. Ten years ago, Wenzhou did not have today's phenomenon of spending tens of thousands of yuan to build ancestral graves, eating, drinking, gambling, etc. But at that time, Wenzhou was famous for farmers selling their children and begging on the streets. Today, Wenzhou people are rich, but there are negative phenomena. What should we do? I think some negative phenomena are not fully exposed, and there will be more annoying and disgusting phenomena. For example, drug trafficking will also appear in the future. How to view it? We must treat it, treat it strictly, and minimize it, but it is difficult to completely avoid it. Unless we abandon reform and opening up. If we want reform and opening up, we cannot completely avoid negative phenomena. This is being realistic. If we do not view the problem in this way, we will repeat the old tune of "satellites in the sky and red flags on the ground" and return to the old road of poverty. Moreover, the root of some negative phenomena is precisely in the old system. If we do not reform and open up, we cannot eliminate poverty and cannot eliminate the root of negative phenomena. In the end, it will damage the reputation of socialism and damage the fundamental interests of the country and nation. Therefore, the banner of seeking truth from facts, emancipating the mind, and reform and opening up cannot be abandoned. No matter what situation we encounter, and no matter when, we must not waver on this. This is a precious wealth that our party has paid a high historical price to obtain, and it is not easy to obtain. We must adhere to it and practice it. This is our historical responsibility!

There is another problem that we should clarify in our discussion of the situation. I call it "is" and "conforms." What does it mean? That is, in the socialist period (especially in its primary stage), there are two situations. One situation is itself Marxism, such as public ownership. Another situation is not Marxism, but its existence "conforms" to Marxism. People still think in the old way, and for the new things that appear in the economic system reform, they do not first ask whether it is beneficial to the development of productive forces, but first ask whether it is "capitalist" or "socialist." In history, we have been punished many times by this way of thinking. The key to this way of thinking is that there is no standard of productive forces and it is not constrained by productive forces, and it blindly pursues "big" and "public." For example, how do we view private enterprises hiring workers? How do we view exploitation? In Shenyang's New City District, there is a private leather factory run by a farmer. He suffers from high myopia, and during the commune period, he could not support himself by working. He could not plow the land cleanly or he would plow out the seedlings. The brigade leader's policy for him was to struggle and deduct points. But he was very diligent and studied hard. The tide of reform and opening up brought him an opportunity. He first set up a family workshop, and then opened a private leather factory. He hired 85 workers, all of whom were unemployed young farmers in the area. Every year, he pays tens of thousands of yuan in taxes to the state, solves the employment problem of 85 farmers, and creates wealth for society, enriching the shoe market. Obviously, it contributes to society and has a positive meaning for the development of productive forces, which is beneficial to the prosperity of socialist undertakings. In this fundamental sense, the existence of this phenomenon is both necessary and inevitable. Therefore, adhering to the things that conform to Marxism is adhering to Marxism. Since we are enthusiastic about socialism, we should first be enthusiastic about the development of productive forces. Therefore, the theory of the primary stage, the theory of the standard of productive forces, and the theory of commodity economy must not be shaken.

This makes me think that our university teachers and students should have theoretical interest, theoretical pursuit, and theoretical goals. We should combine situation education with theoretical education and observe and discuss the situation from the combination of theory and practice. Only by enhancing theoretical consciousness can we enhance reform consciousness. Our reform started with insufficient theoretical preparation. Reform needs theoretical guidance and theoretical support. Changing people's ideas relies on practice and theory. We should promote the theoretical learning of the entire faculty and students to a new stage through the discussion of the situation.

Reform needs theory, and theory needs reform. Reform is not to "revolutionize" Marxism. On the contrary, reform is to abandon the leftist dogmatism that has constrained people's minds for many years. Dogmatism has never been Marxism, but a distortion of Marxism. Reform is to return to the source and maintain the purity of Marxism. Second, it is to realistically affirm and negate the individual outdated conclusions and utopian ideas of Marxism. Third, it is to explain new situations and answer new questions under the guidance of the basic principles of Marxism. Reform is the development of Marxism, and only development is the true adherence to Marxism.

In terms of economic theory, I think we need to break through five basic theoretical concepts.

First, break away from the theory of product economy and establish a new concept of socialist commodity economy. The core is the concept of competition and the mechanism of competition.

Second, break away from the "book" planned economy theory and establish a new concept of "big planning." That is, the "legs" of the commodity economy are as long as the "legs" of planned management. The entire society, economy, and culture should be included in the national macro-management.

Third, break away from the theory of "equal distribution" and establish a new theory of multi-level and diverse socialist distribution relations. Currently, the main unfairness is egalitarianism. It is deeply rooted. Egalitarianism is the most "unequal," it covers up the essence of unpaid appropriation of others' labor.

Fourth, break away from the old concept of high employment and low efficiency and the iron rice bowl, and establish a new theory of socialist unemployment reserve army and social security. The iron rice bowl will inevitably lead to the big pot. The 8-hour work system has already become a mere formality. If we do not reform, our national spirit will decline.

Fifth, break away from the theory of single public ownership and state-owned and state-run enterprises, and establish a new theory of diverse and diverse socialist property relations. We should make the 100 million people have property rights benefits, property rights risks, and property rights constraints under the new property rights system. Enhance the national asset concern. We cannot privatize, but we should make investments socialized and popularized. Establish a social ownership system - a prototype of a future communist free association of individuals.

In short, how to observe the situation is essentially a problem of ideological and theoretical concepts. The teachers and students of our comprehensive university should work hard and make contributions in this area!

### 用正确的方法观察形势

专栏：

　　用正确的方法观察形势
    辽宁大学校长  冯玉忠
    大家都关心形势，都在议论形势问题。我们高等学校的师生员工对形势的认识和分析应该是高层次的。要从历史的角度、全球的角度观察社会、分析形势。通过对形势的分析与研讨，振奋我们的精神，增强改革意识和参与意识，增强我们的社会责任感。
    形势教育，３０多年来形成的老套套，人们不爱听了。所以，形势教育的内容、方式和方法，也应改革。要通过研讨，提高我们的观察力；要出新思想、新观念。不但要提高自己的认识水平，还应对社会有所贡献。
    形势问题很广泛，包括经济形势、政治形势、思想形势以及国际形势，等等。我主要谈谈思想形势，中间也涉及到一些经济形势和理论观念问题。
    对人们的议论、牢骚、民谣、顺口溜要具体分析，不能一概用“旧观念”堵人的嘴
     让我们从国民心态谈起。
    今春以来，人们的议论、牢骚很多。民谣、顺口溜也不少。怎么看待？怎么分析？这里边学问很多，很值得用心思考。
    据我观察，公民的议论、意见大体可分五类。
    一是因为党政机关存在腐败现象，公民有意见、有牢骚。除少数不负责任的误传以外，对这类意见应该认真听取。在很多问题上，它反映了公民观念的转变和觉悟的提高。也体现了社会主义民主空气正在浓厚起来。这是公民监督、舆论监督的重要形式。因此，中央已经采取果断措施整治腐败现象。
    二是因为决策失误或工作有缺点，公民有意见、发议论。这表明群众的参与意识在增强，是好现象。应该认真听取公民的批评、建议，健全政府的决策程序，改进政府工作。
    第三类，不是工作问题，更不是作风问题，而是因为透明度不够，缺少双向信息传递，公民不了解真情，有误解。出路是加强透明度，改进我们的信息传递工作。
    第四，由于改革旧体制，利益结构调整，使一些人的心态失衡，因而有怨气、发牢骚、编民谣。
    第五类则是属于思想观念问题。由于观念陈旧，对改革、开放中的一些新事物，看不惯、不习惯；对社会、经济和文化领域中的消极现象，用旧观念看，越看越严重。因而意见、牢骚成堆。有些民谣的内容“鲜明”地反映了观念的陈旧。
    不过，在对待观念问题上，有两点值得注意。一是不可一听意见就用“旧观念”堵人的嘴；二是不能说只有你存在旧观念问题，我没有观念问题，我是教育你的。万万不能这样做。所以，我主张形势问题大家都要平等地研讨。
    现在是真正显示思想政治工作的威力和价值的时代，政治工作者不该有失落感
    上述五类意见、牢骚之间是什么关系呢？
    据我观察，它们之间不是孤立的或积木式的，而是混合型的。往往腐败现象、物价上涨是“引爆点”，在观念问题上结扣，从而形成一种矛盾、一种困惑。就是说，由于旧观念作祟而造成的议论、怨气、牢骚，是大量的、普遍的。这就对我们政治思想工作提出了挑战。思想政治工作帮助人们转变思想观念是当务之急，也是目前进行形势教育的重要内容。或者说，所谓形势教育要从“这里”入手。就这个根本意义来讲，当今时代是呼唤思想家的时代。思想政治工作和理论工作，乃至我们文科各系的教学与研究工作的内容，从来也没有现在这样丰富多彩和有趣味。试想，当今有多少社会的、政治的、经济的以及文化的问题，需要我们思想政治工作者和理论工作者来思考、回答？这是真正显示思想政治工作的威力和价值的时代。我们应该把它作为一项系统工程来对待，来研究。这是既艰巨又高尚的事业。政治工作者怎么会有“失落感”呢？实在不应有！
    如何观察形势呢？
    根据我个人的体会，要有四个标准。
    用生产力的标准看形势，这要有比较观，但比的目的不是让人们“知足”，而是要振奋精神、增强信心
    一、用生产力的标准看形势。这要有比较观。但比的目的不是让人们“知足”，而是要振奋精神，增强信心。
    我不想罗列统计数字，那是枯燥的。从我们每个人的“生活实践”中都能看得到、体验到的事实谈起。
    我们的改革号称十年。但经济体制改革实际上只有五年。十一届三中全会后的头五年，举国上下，主要是拨乱反正，落实政策。当然这也是改革。农村的家庭承包制大面积推广是１９８３年，城市改革试点１９８４年开始。五年的改革，使我们的国家在政治上和经济上进入了建国以来的最好时期。生产力迅速发展，城市和乡村的面貌发生了巨大变化。用生产力的标准看形势，我们是理直气壮的。就以我们熟悉的沈阳为例，十年前是什么样子？五年前是什么样子？今天又是什么样子？１９８３年我出国回到沈阳，就像从城市回到乡村一样。可是今年再从国外回来，就没有那么大的反差了。现在我们辽大接待外宾，总要给他安排游览市容，因为现在有“看头”了。从人民生活看，虽然边远地区还有上千万人的温饱问题没有完全解决，但绝大多数人民的生活大大提高了。衣食住行都有改善，虽然程度不同。十年前，下班时走到我们辽大家属住宅区，老远就能听见冬冬地剁菜声。是剁馅包饺子吗？不，老师们在剁鸡食。那时，辽大学生食堂的“特产”是玉米面扣饼；早晚是玉米面糊糊。现在，大学生的衣、食、用的，都比教师十年前好多了！六七十年代，辽宁人去北京出差多辛苦啊，猪肉、粉条、挂面、洗衣粉……什么都得背，人称“东北虎”。如今这顶帽子摘掉了！
    有人说，过去低工资制时代也不像现在“乱”。但不要忘记，那时候是靠强控手段维持的。经济上，物资短缺就发票。据统计，７０年代全国性票证就多达７７种。辽宁更多。１９７５年中文系一位老师对我说，文盲是不能进辽大职工食堂就餐的。因为他搞不清各种票。粮票分全国粮票和地方粮票，地方粮票有省、市粮票；到食堂换餐券时，又分粗粮票、细粮票；细粮票还分米票、面票……当时还有“理论”，说这是计划供应。实际是配给制。甚至说这是按需分配，“具有共产主义因素”。当时谁议论过？政治上，一个概念就使一片人老老实实。“资产阶级知识分子”——一大片人老老实实了；又提出“走资本主义道路当权派”，又是一大片人老老实实了。有人说，最近不是也有的商品又发票了吗？是的。但这和过去不同。第一，不是全面的物资短缺，只是个别品种。或是因为抢购风造成的，或是因为原材料不足。第二，公开向公民作了说明，这是定量或限量供应，是暂时的。实事求是。
    总之，用生产力标准看形势，我们的国家确实发展了、兴旺了、进步了，人民生活水平提高了。
    用改革、开放和商品经济的标准看形势，消极现象不是商品经济带来的，而是由于商品经济不发达造成的
    二、要用改革、开放和商品经济的标准看形势。用产品经济观点看，现在“乱套了”。但用新的商品经济观点看，就能看出我们的进步和发展，也能正确地看待存在的问题。改革、开放给我们的国家带来了前所未有的生机与活力。现在社会上一些消极现象不是商品经济带来的，恰恰是由于商品经济不发达而出现的。商品经济是信誉经济，我们现在却出现好多假冒商品。用改革、开放的观点看形势就开窍了。如分配不公的问题，不公现象主要在哪儿？一个民族不怕挣钱多，就怕挣钱易。现在有些人挣钱容易。为什么旧社会一个小商小贩只能养家糊口，而现在却能暴发呢？恰恰是旧体制空隙太多。当前有空子可钻，没有平等竞争，再加上“官倒”。越是不改革开放越会给暴发户创造机会。头几年倒卖花生米就可暴发，而现在就不行了。用改革、开放和商品经济观点看形势，就会增强我们改革的信念，就能正确对待若干消极现象。多年来有个传统做法，有问题就从思想上找原因，叫做灵魂深处爆发革命。建议同志们读两本书：马克思的《政治经济学批判序言》、《德意志意识形态》。任何一种社会现象都可以从经济关系上找到原因。
    　用辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义观点分析形势，克服简单、片面、绝对的变态文化心理
    三、用辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义观点观察和分析形势。这虽然是老话，但经过反思，过去没做到，大量的是用唯心主义形而上学观点看问题。多年来，由于种种原因，人们形成了一种简单化、片面化、绝对化的文化心理结构。我们要克服这种变态的心理。事物是复杂的、联系的、发展变化的，所以用孤立、片面和静止的观点看问题是得不出正确结论的。如粮食问题，粮食收购价要提，销售价提不提？提销售价群众有意见，国家不得不采取补贴的办法。波兰补不起了，出现闹事。我们近几年暗补没减少还得增加明补。全面地、发展地看形势，就会冷静，就会理解政府的困难，就会增强社会责任感。我们要培养对人负责、对社会负责的品格。这是我们培养人才的重要内容。
　　用大实验的观点看形势、看社会主义实践史：失误难免，出路在改革
    四、用大实验的观点看形势、看社会、看社会主义的实践史、社会主义作为一种学说或一种理论体系，由马克思恩格斯完成了从空想到科学的革命。但就实践的意义说，从十月革命到今天，社会主义始终还处于实验阶段。因此，失误在所难免。我不赞成过分地从领袖人物的个人品德或个人责任上找出路。这样做，岂不是一个偶像失灵，谴责一番，又把希望寄托在新的偶像上？这不是历史唯物主义观点。我的意见是，要把精力放到解剖体制弊端上，因为偶像本身就是体制造成的。这样，才能总结出历史财富，有利于人们正确地看待历史，看待今天的形势；才能增强人们的改革意识，寻求“为什么要改革、改革什么和怎样改革”的答案。
    用大实验的观点看形势，就是要对社会主义实践史进行总体反思。反思，集中到一点上就是如何看待社会主义。多年来，在社会主义问题上，人们始终没有摆脱空想与科学、幻想与现实的矛盾。往往用道德标准看社会主义，“干”社会主义。什么都想“一刀两断”，一切从头开始，一切“对着干”，否定继承性。求公、求纯、求快。结果，吃了大亏。最近看台湾省的电视剧《昨夜星辰》，给了我很大启发。它描写了一群矛盾，就靠一个字——“孝”，解决、消化了那么多矛盾，而没有酿成社会问题。这是中国传统文化的典型。可是，过去我们对这些都批判了，完全否定了。在经济问题上，类似这样的教训就更多了。
    我们今天遇到的经济、社会问题，很多是老病复发。什么通货膨胀，基建过热，楼堂馆所；什么社会集团购买力失控，分配与消费领域中的恶性攀比，等等。这些“老病”今天发作，有今天的工作问题，有今天的失控以及管理混乱问题。不能把责任统统推到“昨天”。但同样不容置疑的是，“病根”在昨天，在昨天的体制弊端。为什么３０多年对大建楼堂馆所的风气屡刹不止？根源在于我们没有产权约束力。所以，从根本上解决这类问题，出路在改革。改革我们的计划管理体制，改革就业制度和产权制度。
    　　　　不改革开放，既不能治穷，也不能消除消极现象的根源
    一是如何看待经济繁荣与消极现象。去年春天我曾经想了一个题目，就是“繁荣与罪恶”（罪恶泛指消极现象，下同）。人们往往从愿望出发，只要繁荣，不要罪恶。所以，一看到社会、经济生活中出现某些消极现象，就大有今不如昔之感。越看越严重，越看越生气，因而大发其牢骚。甚至怀疑改革开放的效果和“方向”。历史的经验值得注意。多年来我们就是这样“想”社会主义、“干”社会主义的。结果又如何呢？就是一个字：穷。其实贫穷是最大的罪恶。社会主义就是要消灭贫穷。但是，在经济发展过程中，在商品经济发展过程中，农业社会那种质朴的东西必然消失，伴随而来的是一些消极现象。只有生产力发展到更高水平，像马克思所说的——“巨大发展和高度增长”时，才能消除罪恶。我们的责任是最大限度地减少它。温州地区十年前没有今天这种耗资万元修祖坟、吃喝嫖赌等消极现象。但那时温州是以农民卖儿卖女、沿街乞讨而闻名全国的。今天温州人富了，可又有消极现象。怎么办？我认为有些消极现象暴露得还不充分，还会有令人烦恼、厌恶的现象出现。比如，贩毒，将来也会有的。怎么看？要治，严治，最大限度地减少它，但难以完全避免。除非放弃改革开放。要改革开放，就不可能完全避免消极现象。这就叫实事求是。不这么看问题，我们就会重复“卫星上天红旗落地”的老调，就会重新回到贫穷的老路上去。况且，有些消极现象的根子，恰恰在旧体制上。不改革开放，既不能治穷，也不能消除消极现象的根源。最终，还是损害社会主义的声誉，损害国家和民族的根本利益。所以，实事求是、解放思想、改革开放的旗帜不能丢。不论遇到什么情况，也不论什么时候，对此都不能动摇。这是我们党付出高昂的历史代价换来的宝贵财富，得之不易。我们要坚持它，实践它。这是我们的历史性责任！
    　允许符合社会发展规律的事物存在，就是坚持马克思主义；热心于社会主义，首先要热心于发展生产力
    还有一个问题，也是我们研讨形势所应该搞清楚的。我管它叫“就是”与“符合”。什么意思呢？就是说，在社会主义时期（尤其是它的初级阶段）存在两种情况。一种情况本身就是马克思主义的，例如公有制。另一种情况不是马克思主义，但它的存在“符合”马克思主义。人们至今还按照习惯的思维方式想问题，对经济体制改革中出现的新事物，不是首先问它是否有利于生产力的发展，而是先问它姓“资”姓“社”。在历史上我们多次受过这种思维方式的惩罚。这种思维方式的要害是没有生产力标准，也不受生产力的制约，一味地追求一大二公。例如，对私人企业雇工怎么看？对剥削怎么看？沈阳新城子区有一家由农民创办的私营皮革厂。他患高度近视症，公社化期间自己劳动养不了自己。铲地不是铲不净就是把苗铲掉。生产队长对他的政策是一批斗二扣分。但他很刻苦钻研，进取上进。改革开放大潮给他带来了机遇。他初则创办家庭作坊，继则开办了私营皮革厂。雇工８５人，全是当地待业的青年农民。每年给国家上缴数万元税金，又解决了８５个农民就业问题，还为社会创造了财富，丰富了皮鞋市场。显然，它对社会有贡献，对生产力的发展有积极意义，也就是对繁荣社会主义事业有利。就这个根本意义说，这种现象的存在，既是必要的，也是必然的。因此，坚持符合马克思主义的事物，就是坚持马克思主义。我们既然热心于社会主义，首先就应该热心于发展生产力。所以，初级阶段理论、生产力标准的理论以及商品经济理论，无论如何不能动摇。
    改革需要理论，理论需要改革，经济理论上要突破陈旧的基本观念
    由此使我联想，我们大学师生要有理论兴趣、理论追求和理论目标。我们应该把形势教育与理论教育结合起来，从理论与实践的结合上，观察形势、研讨形势。增强理论意识，才能增强改革意识。我们的改革是在理论准备不够充分的情况下起步的。改革需要理论导向、理论力量的支持。转变人们的观念，一靠实践，二靠理论。我们应通过形势研讨，把全校师生的理论学习推向一个新阶段。
    改革需要理论，理论需要改革。改革当然不是要“革掉”马克思主义。恰恰相反。改革，一是要抛弃多年来束缚人们头脑的左倾教条主义。教条主义从来就不是马克思主义，而是对马克思主义的歪曲。改革就是要正本清源，维护马克思主义的纯洁性。二是要实事求是地扬弃马克思主义个别的过了时的结论和带有空想成分的设想。三是要在马克思主义基本原理指导下，说明新情况，回答新问题。改革就是发展马克思主义，只有发展，才是真正地坚持马克思主义。
    就经济理论而言，我看在五个基本理论观念上要突破。
    一是破除产品经济论，树立社会主义商品经济的新观念。核心是竞争观念和竞争机制问题。
    二是破除“本本”计划经济论，树立“大计划”的新观念。就是说商品经济的“腿”多长，计划管理的“腿”就多长。整个社会、经济、文化都应纳入国家宏观管理之中。
    三是破除“平均分配”论，立社会主义分配关系多层次、多样化的新理论。当前，主要不公还是平均主义。它根深蒂固。平均主义最“不平”，它掩盖着无偿占有他人劳动的实质。
    四是破除高就业低效益和铁饭碗的旧观念，建立新的社会主义失业后备军和社会保障的新理论。铁饭碗必然是大锅饭。８小时工作制已经名存实亡。再不改革，我们的民族精神就要衰退。
    五是破除单一公有和国有国营官办论，立社会主义产权关系多元化、多样化的所有制理论。要使１０亿人民在新的产权制度下，既有产权利益，又有产权风险和产权约束力。增强全民族的资产关切度。不能私有化，但要使投资社会化、群众化。建立社会共有制——一种未来共产主义自由人联合体的雏型。
    总之，如何观察形势问题，实质是思想理论观念问题。我们综合大学的师生要在这方面下功夫，做贡献！
