After the Xiamen International Women's Football Invitational Tournament, the head coach of the Chinese women's football team, Shang Ruihua, spoke to a reporter about his evaluation of the players' performance and his plans for future training.

The recently adjusted Chinese women's football team, after a few weeks of training, played five matches in Xiamen. Shang Ruihua particularly valued the match against the Japanese team, while the 5-0 victory over Finland seemed to hold less significance. Although Finland ranks third in women's football among the Nordic countries and boasted that they would score a goal against China, Shang Ruihua believed that if Norway and Sweden are considered first-tier, Finland is at best a lower second-tier team.

After adding new players, the current average age of the Chinese women's football team is 20, and the average height is 1.66 meters. The main tasks for this year include the seventh Asian Women's Football Championship against Japan, the eleventh Asian Games next year against Japan and Chinese Taipei, and the 1991 inaugural Women's World Cup to challenge the world's top teams. Although a few 16 and 17-year-old youngsters are still inexperienced, from a future perspective, infusing "fresh blood" is timely, especially since the team now has a certain foundation. Shang Ruihua said that before the final against Finland, he instructed the players to control the opponent's diagonal long passes and high balls, reducing the threat of their headers. This tactical intent was basically achieved, with no major defensive mistakes, preventing Finland's tall players from utilizing their height advantage and exposing their technical weaknesses.

Shang Ruihua felt that the match against Japan revealed the Chinese team's weaknesses in left-wing attacks, slow reactions in front of the goal, and relaxation after scoring. The match against the Fujian team again exposed the young players' inability to play "water ball." The team's coordination awareness has improved compared to last year's Guangzhou International Women's Football Championship, and players like Niu Lijie and Wu Weiying have developed their own styles. However, the problem of weak fundamentals still exists, and the selection of players for some positions is not ideal, often appearing confused when handling the ball.

Thirty years ago, the famous national football team defender Sun Yuming watched the Chinese women's football team's matches this time and said that the Chinese team has too few attacking methods and has not yet formed a variety of suitable attack and defense tactics for their physical conditions. Some football experts also agreed. Shang Ruihua clearly stated that the Chinese team will focus on technical and tactical training in the future to address this issue.

### 主教练的满意与不满意——听商瑞华评说中国女足

　　主教练的满意与不满意
    ——听商瑞华评说中国女足
    厦门国际女子足球邀请赛结束后，中国队主教练商瑞华向记者谈了他对队员们表现的评价及今后训练的设想。
    调整不久的中国女足经过短短几周的集训，在厦门打了五场球。最受商瑞华看重的是对日本队一仗，而５∶０胜芬兰队好像意义并不大。尽管芬兰队在女足运动发达的北欧国家中排列第三，又扬言要赢中国队一个球，但照商瑞华看，如果挪威队和瑞典队算甲级水平，芬兰队顶多是乙级偏下的水平。
    中国女子足球队补充新人后，目前全队平均年龄２０岁，平均身高１米６６，今年的主要任务是第七届亚洲女足锦标赛迎战日本队，明年第１１届亚运会与日本和中国台北队较量，１９９１年首届世界杯女足赛上向世界劲旅挑战。虽然几名１６、１７岁的小将还嫩，但从未来的目标来说，注入“新鲜血液”是及时的，何况全队现在有一定基础。商瑞华说，与芬兰队决赛前，曾布置队员要控制对方斜长传高球，减少对方头球的威胁，这个战术意图基本上实现了，防守上没有大的失误，使芬兰队身材高大的优势发挥不出来，还暴露了技术差的弱点。
    商瑞华感到对日本队一役，反映出中国队左路进攻差，门前反应慢和进球后有所松懈的不足，对福建队一场又暴露出年轻队员不会踢“水球”的弱点。全队的配合意识比去年在广州国际女足锦标赛时有提高，牛丽杰和吴伟英等也有了自己的特点，不过基本功不强的情况还普遍存在，个别位置上的人选尚不理想，处理球总有点发懵。
    ３０年前国家足球队著名边后卫孙玉明看过中国女足这次比赛后说，中国队进攻办法太少，还没有形成适合自己身体条件的多种攻防套路。一些足球行家也有同感。商瑞华明确表示，中国队今后将着重于技术和意识方面的训练，解决这一问题。
