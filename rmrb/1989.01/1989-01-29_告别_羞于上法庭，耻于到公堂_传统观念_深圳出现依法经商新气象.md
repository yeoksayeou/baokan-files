People in Shenzhen are bidding farewell to the traditional notion of "shame in going to court, disgrace in appearing in court" and are beginning to see a new atmosphere of conducting business in accordance with the law.

"In Shenzhen, doing business is like walking into a trap." This is the evaluation of Shenzhen's business environment by people from inland provinces. Statistics show that in 1981, the Shenzhen Intermediate People's Court accepted only one economic dispute case, while last year this number rose to over 1,200 cases, with a total dispute amount of 50.9 billion yuan.

"Special economic zones' reform and practice are ahead of their time and call for legal protection." Shenzhen Intermediate People's Court President Wang Changying told the reporter. To bring Shenzhen's investment environment under the rule of law, in July of last year, the court established the "Economic Dispute Mediation Center," the first of its kind in the country.

By January 24, this mediation center had accepted 329 cases, with a total amount of 400 million yuan, 29 million Hong Kong dollars, and 1.91 million US dollars. Due to the immediate acceptance and mediation process, the average time from case acceptance to resolution has been reduced from over half a year to 16 days, with the shortest being two hours.

Notably, this economic dispute mediation center provides convenience for small-amount complaints. In the past half year, the center has accepted the smallest complaint case of 600 yuan and the largest of 53 million yuan.

Local legal scholars believe that the thinking of the leaders of the Shenzhen Intermediate People's Court is very clear: "The law should serve the economy." "How to provide legal basis and protection for the special economic zone's pioneering reform experiments" is the goal of the special economic zone judges.

To establish the image of "conducting business in accordance with the law," the Shenzhen Intermediate People's Court and its six subordinate basic-level courts spent six months cleaning up 841 accumulated cases from before last year. The longest of these accumulated cases lasted seven years, recovering over 100 million yuan in economic losses for the state.

　　告别“羞于上法庭，耻于到公堂”传统观念    
    深圳出现依法经商新气象
    本报讯  记者王楚报道：深圳人正告别“羞于上法庭，耻于到公堂”的传统观念，开始出现依法经商的新气象。
    “在深圳做生意，到处是坑”。这是内地人对深圳贸易环境的评价。有资料表明，１９８１年，深圳市法院受理经济纠纷案只有一宗，去年上升到１２００多宗，纠纷总金额高达５０９亿元人民币。
    “特区超前改革、实践，呼唤着法律保护”。深圳市中级人民法院院长王常营对记者说。为把深圳投资环境纳入法制轨道，去年７月，市中级人民法院成立了“经济纠纷调解中心”，这在全国是第一家。
    截至１月２４日，这家纠纷调解中心收案３２９件，总金额高达４亿元人民币，２９００万元港币，１９１万元美金。由于即告即收，即收即调，从收案到结案，平均由过去半年以上减少到１６天，最短为两小时。
    值得一提的是，这家经济纠纷调解中心为小数额投诉提供了方便。半年来，该中心受理投诉案件最小为６００元，最大为５３００万元。
    此间法学界人士认为，深圳市中级人民法院负责人的“法律要为经济服务”的思路十分明确。“特区的超前改革试验，如何在法律上得到依据和保护”，这是特区法官们的奋斗目标。
    为树立“依法经商”形象，深圳市中级人民法院和所属６个基层法院，用６个月时间，对去年以前立案审理的８４１宗积案，进行了清理。这批积案最长时间达７年之久，为国家挽回经济损失１亿多元人民币。
