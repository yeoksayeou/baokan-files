	The Fearless Youth
	— A Record of Excellent Deputy Prosecutor Lin Lide

	He has only been working for three years, but he has already received a commendation from the Supreme People's Procuratorate and has been awarded a first-class merit citation by the Jilin Provincial Procuratorial System.

	His name is Lin Lide. He is 28 years old and a deputy prosecutor at the Chaoyang District Procuratorate in Changchun City, Jilin Province.

		Facing the Intrusion of Power

	“Quickly come and report the case situation!” This was a phone call from a certain leader of the Changchun Municipal Political and Legal Committee.

	Lin Lide and a deputy procurator were summoned to the office of the Municipal Political and Legal Committee. The leader who made the call asked, “Who authorized you to investigate Liu Shurun? Do you have any evidence?”

	“Yes!” Lin Lide listed five instances of embezzlement crimes in one breath.

	“Just return the case then! This is something the higher-ups have instructed to look into!”

	It turned out that at the end of 1985, the Chaoyang District Procuratorate accepted the case of Liu Shurun, the person in charge of the Yongchang Street Boiler Factory, who had embezzled 190,000 yuan. However, two colleagues had each taken over the case and then inexplicably dropped it.

	The young Lin Lide took over this difficult case. The defendant refused to admit guilt, claiming that there were 38 legitimate transactions, and finally said, “Young man, you will have to take responsibility for this!” Lin replied, “Let’s see, I will take responsibility to the end.” As a result, after investigating just six transactions, it was confirmed that the defendant had embezzled 2,481 yuan. As the case was progressing deeper, relevant personnel from the Municipal Political and Legal Committee intervened.

	In the face of power and pressure, Lin stood his ground and told the leader from the Municipal Political and Legal Committee, “Everyone must act according to the law!” The leader was speechless.

		The Law Cannot Yield to Personal Favor

	Not long after Lin Lide became a deputy prosecutor, he took over a case involving the high-priced sale of 300 tons of steel. His hometown friend Zhang Yongxue came to plead for the criminal. Zhang Yongxue had done Lin a great favor, helping him find a place to live when he moved to Changchun, providing financial assistance when he was in financial difficulty, and even arranging his marriage...

	Lin sincerely said, “Brother, other things can be discussed, but this matter makes me uncomfortable.” The brother showed displeasure, “This person is my relative. Just give him a break.”

	Lin sternly said, “If everyone gives a break, then the law becomes a ‘decorative item’?” After hearing this, the friend stomped his foot and left in anger. After the criminal was sent to trial, the friend also unfeelingly took back the house Lin was borrowing.

	Last October, Lin’s younger brother Lin Sihai was arrested by local public security authorities for participating in a robbery. The elderly mother rushed from Dehui, over a hundred miles away, to Changchun to find Lin Lide. Lin had previously worked in the criminal investigation department of the Dehui Public Security Bureau, and everyone from the bureau chief to the section chief knew him well. This time, the investigators handling his brother's case were also his good friends. He comforted his mother, “Don’t be sad, old lady. I will handle this matter well.” After his mother returned, he immediately reported the matter to the procuratorate leadership and stated his position, that he would not intervene.

		The Unyielding Scales of Justice

	Once, Lin Lide was on a business trip to Beijing. In the evening, a man carrying a briefcase walked straight into his room.

	“I want to talk to you alone.” The other people in the room tactfully left. It turned out that this person was Li Jingquan, the manager of Beijing Donghai Trading Company, who had lent 100,000 yuan to a criminal in a fraud case Lin was investigating for a joint venture. This person was afraid that the large sum of money would be difficult to recover, so he came to the investigator's residence.

	After a few pleasantries, the visitor took out a paper package from his briefcase and handed it to Lin, “Here is a small token of appreciation, 3,000 yuan. If my 100,000 yuan is returned first during the recovery of assets, I will give you a 10% commission.”

	Looking at the thick paper package, Lin felt greatly insulted, and he said sternly, “Put away your money! I will handle this matter according to the law!”

	The visitor awkwardly put away the paper package and left. Later, Lin handed over the confiscated 350,000 yuan in assets to the Beijing Xicheng District Second Construction Company according to regulations. The five leaders of this company traveled thousands of miles to Changchun to commend Lin Lide and presented him with a plaque that read, “Upholding the law like a mountain, a model to follow.”

	Upholding the law like a mountain, Lin Lide has maintained the dignity of the law. Over the past three years, he has handled 26 cases and recovered economic losses for the state totaling 760,000 yuan.

### 初生牛犊——记优秀助理检察员林立东

　　初生牛犊
    ——记优秀助理检察员林立东
    高欣　翟景耀
    他才工作３年，就受到了最高人民检察院的通令嘉奖，荣立吉林省检察系统一等功。
    他叫林立东，今年２８岁，吉林省长春市朝阳区检察院助理检察员。
    　　　　面对权势的侵扰
    “赶快来汇报案情！”这是长春市政法委某领导打的电话。
    林立东和一名副检察长被召到市政法委办公室。打电话的这位领导问：“谁让你们审查刘淑运的？你们有什么证据？”
    “有！”林立东一口气列举了５件贪污犯罪事实。
    “案子还是退回去吧！这是上边让过问的！”
    原来，１９８５年底，朝阳区检察院受理了永昌街办锅炉厂负责人刘淑运贪污１．９万元的案子。可是，先后有两位同志刚接手又莫名其妙地放下了。
    年轻的林立东主动接过了这起棘手的案件。被告拒不认帐，扬言钱有３８笔正当去向，末了丢下一句话：“小同志，你要对我负责哟！”小林则一语双关：“查着看吧，我会负责到底的。”结果，刚查６笔就确认被告贪污了２４８１元。案情正向纵深推进时，市政法委有关人员出来干预了。
    在权势和压力面前，小林据理力争，他对市政法委的这位领导说：“谁都得按法律办事！”那位领导哑口无言。
    　　　　法律岂能在人情面前退让
    林立东任助理检察员不久，接手一起高价倒卖３００吨钢材案件。他的同乡好友张永学找上门来，为案犯求情。张永学对小林算得上“恩重如山”，小林调入长春无立足之地时，他四处奔波，帮忙借到一套住房；小林经济陷入窘境时，他慷慨解囊、鼎力相助；就连小林的婚事，也是他一手操办……
    小林诚恳地说：“大哥，别的事都好说，这件事你让我为难。”大哥面露不悦：“这个人是我亲戚。你抬抬手就过去了。”
    小林严肃地说：“如果大家都抬抬手，法律不就成‘摆设’了吗？”听了这话，好友一跺脚，拂袖而去。罪犯被送上审判台后，好友也无情地收回了小林借住的房子。
    去年１０月，小林的四弟林四海因参与抢劫，被当地公安机关逮捕。年迈的母亲连夜从百里之外的德惠赶到长春，找到林立东。小林原在德惠公安局做刑侦工作，上至局长，下至科员都很熟，这次承办他弟弟案件的几个侦查员又是他的好朋友。他安慰母亲说：“你老不要伤心，这件事我一定处理好。”母亲回去后，他当即找到院领导汇报这件事，表明自己的态度，决不插手。
    　　　　不会倾斜的天平
    有一次，林立东出差到北京，傍晚，一个拎皮包的人径直找到他住的房间。
    “我想和您单独谈谈。”房里其他人知趣地退了出去。原来，这人是北京市东海贸易公司经理李景全，在林立东正在侦查的一个诈骗案中，案犯曾向这个经理借过１０万元用于合伙经营。这人怕巨款难以追回，便摸到办案人住处。
    几句寒暄后，来者从皮包里掏出一个纸包递到小林面前：“这点小意思先收下，共３０００元。如果退赃时优先退我那１０万元，再按１０％给你提成。”
    望着那厚厚的纸包，小林感到受了莫大的侮辱，他严肃地说：“收起你的钱吧！公事我一定公办！”
    来者尴尬地收起纸包走了。事后，小林按规定将收缴的３５万元赃款给了北京西城区二建公司。这家公司５位领导千里迢迢赶到长春为林立东请功，并送来一面锦旗，上书：“执法如山，楷模之先”。
    执法如山，林立东维护法律尊严，三年来他先后办结案件２６起，为国家挽回经济损失７６万余元。
