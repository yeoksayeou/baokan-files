	China is beginning to develop intelligent robots with the goal of using high technology to replace one million workers operating in hazardous environments.

	Three types of intelligent robots have become the target products pursued by China's high-tech experts. They will also serve as the "stepping stones" for China to develop fully autonomous intelligent robots by the year 2000.

	It is understood that by the end of this century, mobile intelligent robots for harsh environments, tetherless underwater robots, and intelligent assembly robots will be among the target products for China's high-tech research and development plan in the field of automation. Currently, some models of these three types of robots have completed or are about to complete the product sample selection and evaluation, and have begun the overall conceptual design.

	Robots are an important means of achieving industrial automation. In the past decade, the global robot industry has reached a value of 10 billion US dollars. Due to the common perception of robots as mechanical arms with fixed programs, people often misunderstand that robots are only useful for expanding production and increasing labor productivity. In labor-abundant China, the application of robots seems somewhat inconsistent with national conditions. In fact, in the past five years, robots have shown a new development trend internationally, mainly used to expand human activity ranges, such as deep-sea exploration and operations in strong radiation areas, deep underground layers, and other environments where humans cannot enter.

	China's economic development has already created an objective need for the application of robots. Statistics show that China currently has 10 million workers engaged in hazardous operations, and their labor needs to be replaced by robots. For China's products to enter the international market and compete, robots are also important for ensuring product quality and industrial efficiency. It is understood that China's first-generation industrial robots, such as those for spot welding, arc welding, handling, and underwater operations, have already produced sample machines. Experts estimate that in two to three years, they will enter practical use and be mass-produced during the "Eighth Five-Year Plan" period.

	However, these are not yet intelligent robots because they can only perform mechanical actions and lack sensory and judgment capabilities. For example, a welding robot can perform spot welding and arc welding according to pre-programmed instructions, but it cannot adapt to changing conditions.

	The intelligent robot group of the high-tech plan will research the system structure, mechanism, control, vision, and high-performance sensors of intelligent robots, as well as the application of artificial intelligence and human-robot interaction technology. If the tasks are completed as planned by the end of this century, it will bring China's intelligent robot production to the international level of the 1990s, and the technology to the level of the mid-1990s, with some technologies possibly achieving breakthroughs.

	While researching intelligent robot products, Chinese experts have not neglected the research on related basic technologies. They have formulated a research outline for the basic technologies of intelligent robots. This outline arranges for some high-level basic technology research led by national key laboratories, relying on national laboratories to track the latest international technologies; it also arranges for model test beds and individual technologies to provide experimental conditions for robots.

　　我国着手发展智能机器人    
    目标是运用高技术取代一千万在险恶环境中操作的工人
    本报讯  记者陈祖甲报道：三种类型的智能机器人，已成为我国高技术专家追求的目标产品。它们也将是我国在２０００年以后研制全自治智能机器人的“跳板”。
    据了解，将在本世纪末诞生的在恶劣环境下的移动式智能机器人、水下无缆机器人和智能装配机器人是我国高技术研究发展计划自动化领域研制的目标产品之一。目前，这三种类型的机器人中有的型号已经完成或即将完成产品样机的选型论证，并开始总体概念设计。
    机器人是实现工业自动化的重要手段，近１０年来，国际上机器人的产值达到１００亿美元。由于人们目前常见的是程序固定的机械手，使人们产生一种误解，以为机器人仅仅有利于扩大再生产，提高劳动生产率。在劳动力充足的中国，应用机器人似乎不大合国情。其实，近５年左右，国际上机器人出现发展的新势头，主要用于扩大人的活动范围，像到深水海域进行探测，到强核辐射区域、深地层等人类中无法进入的场合中作业。
    我国经济发展已经有了应用机器人的客观需要。有资料表明，我国目前从事恶劣危险操作的工人达１０００万人，这些人的劳动需要由机器人替代。我国的产品要进入国际市场竞争，机器人对于保证产品的高质量、工业的高效率也有重要意义。据了解，我国第一代工业机器人，如从事点焊、弧焊、搬运、水下作业的机器人已经生产了样机，行家们估计，再过二三年即可进入实用，在“八五”计划期间批量生产。
    但是，这些还称不上智能机器人，因为它们只能做机械动作，没有感知及判断能力。比如，焊接机器人可以按事先示教程序从事点焊、弧焊，但不能适应条件变化。
    高技术计划的智能机器人组将研究智能机器人的体系结构、机构、控制、视觉及高性能传感器、人工智能的应用、人和机器人交互的技术。如果在本世纪末按计划完成任务，将使我国智能机器人的生产达到国际９０年代水平，在技术上达到９０年代中期水平，个别技术还可能有所突破。
    在研究智能机器人产品的同时，我国专家没有放松对有关基础技术的研究，他们已经制订了智能机器人基础技术研究纲要。这个纲要，安排了一部分由国家重点实验室牵头的高层次基础技术研究，依靠国家实验室，跟踪国外最新技术；还安排了型号的试验床和单项技术，为机器人提供试验条件。
