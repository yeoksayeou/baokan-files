In the frequent disaster year of 1988, the People's Liberation Army participated in nearly 9,000 rescue and relief operations. When floods struck, when emergencies suddenly occurred, the soldiers' brave figures were everywhere.

According to the General Political Department's mass work department, last year the entire army dispatched over a million personnel to participate in rescue operations, deployed more than a thousand aircraft, 700 ships, and over 60,000 mechanical vehicles. They rescued 270,000 people in danger and transported over 800,000 tons of various materials.

Where there is disaster, the soldiers rush to the scene. In August last year, the Nenjiang River experienced a major flood, and the northeastern city of Qiqihar was in urgent need of help. Local troops quickly dispatched over 5,000 soldiers to build dikes and reinforce embankments in the rain. They fought continuously for 15 days and nights, saving the city and the railway along the line.

In the rescue and relief operations, the broad masses of soldiers and officers demonstrated a spirit of selflessness and devotion that deeply moved the people. After a strong earthquake struck in Lancang and Gongma, over 8,000 soldiers from the Yunnan-based troops braved frequent aftershocks to rescue injured civilians, disregarding their own safety. They enthusiastically helped the people build temporary shelters and homes, while they themselves endured hardships. They cleared the collapsed department stores and rescued goods worth millions of yuan, but did not take even a needle or thread for themselves. The people sighed, "In critical moments, it is the PLA that stands firm."

In another report, the Chinese People's Armed Police Force, in the new situation of reform and opening up, fully played its functional role and successfully completed various tasks centered on duty. Over the past year, in addition to ensuring the safety of fixed targets, they also completed over 140,000 temporary missions, participated in over 1,800 rescue and relief operations, deployed 62,000 personnel, rescued a large number of people and state property, and made significant contributions to maintaining social order and protecting people's lives and property.

While ensuring social security, the armed police forces actively participated in rescue and relief work. Over the past year, whenever major accidents and natural disasters occurred across the country, the broad masses of armed police soldiers always stepped forward. While ensuring the safety of their duty targets, they spared no effort in rescue and relief operations. In August last year, Hangzhou was hit by a strong typhoon, and the city was instantly in ruins. The broad masses of soldiers from the Zhejiang Armed Police Corps, led by Corps Commander Cheng Zhaofu and Deputy Commander Chen Wenming, were the first to rush to the streets. They endured hunger and heat, propped up ancient trees, and cleared the scene.

　　哪里有灾情　子弟兵就奔赴哪里    
    解放军去年百万人次参加救灾抢险    
    武警部队维护治安保护人民作出贡献
    据新华社北京１月２６日电（通讯员刘文华、记者易俭如）在灾情频繁的１９８８年，人民解放军参加抢险救灾近９０００次。当洪水袭来的时刻，当险情突然而至的瞬间，处处可见子弟兵奋勇扑救的身影。
    据总政治部群众工作部门提供的情况，去年全军共派出百万人次投入抢险，出动飞机千余架次，舰艇７００艘次，机械车辆６万多台次，抢救遇险群众达２７万人，抢运各种物资８０多万吨。
    哪里有灾情，子弟兵就奔赴哪里。去年８月，嫩江出现特大洪水，东北重镇齐齐哈尔连连告急。当地驻军火速派出５０００多名官兵，冒雨筑坝固堤，接连奋战１５个昼夜，保住了这座城市和沿线铁路。
    在抢险救灾中，广大指战员舍生忘死、舍己为人的精神深受群众称道。在澜沧、耿马地区发生强烈地震后，驻滇部队参加救灾的８０００余名官兵，冒着频繁余震的危险，奋力抢救受伤群众，置个人安危于度外。他们热心帮助群众搭棚盖房建家园，而自己却风餐露宿。他们清理倒塌的百货商店，抢救出价值数百万元的物品，却不从中占用一针一线。群众感叹地说：关键时刻还是解放军过得硬。
    又讯　中国人民武装警察部队在改革开放的新形势下，充分发挥本身的职能作用，圆满完成了以执勤为中心的各项任务。一年来，除确保固定目标安全外，还完成了各类临时勤务１４万多次，参加抢险救灾１８００多次，出动兵力６．２万人次，抢救出大量群众和国家财产，为维护社会治安和保卫人民生命财产作出了贡献。
    武警各部队在做好社会治安的同时，积极参加抢险救灾工作。一年来，在全国各地，每当发生重大事故和特大自然灾害的关键时刻，武警广大指战员总是挺身而出，他们在确保执勤目标安全的同时，全力以赴投入抢险救灾。去年８月，杭州市遭到强台风袭击，刹时，全城呈现一片惨景。武警浙江总队广大官兵急群众所急，在总队长程兆富、副总队长陈文明带领下，第一个走上街头。他们忍饥饿、冒酷暑，撑起古树，清理现场。
