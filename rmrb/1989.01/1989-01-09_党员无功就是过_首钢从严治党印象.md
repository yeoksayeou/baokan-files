“Party Members Without Merit Are a Failure” – An Impression of Strict Party Governance at Capital Iron and Steel Company

By Jiang Shijie, People's Daily Reporter

“‘Party Members Without Merit Are a Failure,’ the slogan put forth by the Capital Iron and Steel Company (Capital Steel) Party Committee is excellent! When I first heard this phrase at the Capital Steel Contract System Training Class at the Old Dragon Head, my spirit was invigorated! After returning to the factory, I organized a discussion among party members about ‘Without Merit Is a Failure.’ Everyone’s feelings were the same as mine: we must achieve merit and cannot simply blend in with ordinary people!” said Jiang Shijie, the general manager and party secretary of Changbai Mechanical Factory, which had recently been incorporated into Capital Steel, with a face flushed with excitement.

Capital Steel’s ten years of reform have also been ten years of continuously strengthening party building and ensuring the smooth development of enterprise reform. Over the past ten years, the Capital Steel Party Committee has effectively played the role of political leadership and supervision over the enterprise, treating strict party governance as an important guiding ideology and principle, and integrating it into the party’s ideological, organizational, and work style construction.

Let’s first look at three sets of statistics:

First, the quality of the party member cadre has significantly improved: in 1986, 30 party members were commended by the Beijing Municipal Party Committee, and 2 were awarded the title of Beijing Excellent Communist Party Member. In the past two years, 3,442 individuals have been evaluated as company-level excellent communist party members. The proportion of basically unqualified and unqualified party members has decreased from 11.9% in 1979 to 0.4%. Among the 9,617 young party members under the age of 35 in the entire company, more than 7,000 have participated in worker evening universities and TV universities.

Second, the exemplary and vanguard role of party members has become more prominent. In implementing the contract system, wherever there is hardship, party members are at the forefront, and wherever there are key tasks, party members lead the charge. Since 1984, Capital Steel has had 45 individuals evaluated as Beijing Labor Models, of which 37 are party members, accounting for 82%; in 1987, Capital Steel selected 62 modernizers, of which 59 are party members, accounting for 95%.

Third, the prestige of the party has been continuously enhanced. In 1985, 240,000 people in the entire company applied to join the party organization during the “Seventh Five-Year Plan” period; the number of party activists has increased from more than 5,700 in 1981 to more than 13,000 in 1987.

Perhaps these numbers and concepts are dry and dull, so let’s retell a few stories:

In 1985, Capital Steel planned to build another steel plant in the Qian’an mining area, more than 200 kilometers away from Beijing, during the “Seventh Five-Year Plan” period. The company party committee decided to select 400 party members to support the construction, to make up for the shortage of party members in the construction team. These comrades had to move from familiar positions to unfamiliar ones, from working in factory buildings to outdoor construction, from the capital city to the remote mountains of Hebei Province, and from guaranteed wages to non-guaranteed wages (at that time, the construction team’s wages were based on a certain percentage of the output value). It can be said that the mobilization task was extremely arduous, and many employees and family members also had various discussions. However, the actual situation was beyond expectation: the majority of party members eagerly signed up, requesting combat duties, and those who were approved quickly completed the handover and prepared their luggage, all reporting on time. When the time came to leave, wives sent off their husbands, children sent off their fathers, and fathers sent off their sons. The scene and atmosphere were as magnificent and enthusiastic as soldiers going to the front line.

In early 1987, the construction of the second steelmaking plant with an annual output of 300 million tons entered the decisive battle stage. The relevant party organizations of Capital Steel selected elite troops within the party to form 18 party member spearhead teams. When the installation of the steel structure of the No. 1 continuous casting machine was at its most critical point, a snowstorm came, and the ice quickly formed more than an inch thick on the steel frame more than ten meters high, bringing difficulties to the installation of the 500-ton steel structure. The party member spearhead team of the machine repair workshop of the First Machinery Company tied safety belts around their waists, wrapped old cloth around their feet to prevent slipping, and climbed up the steel frame to break the ice and open the way. After more than five hours of hard work, they finally completed the task. During the decisive battle period of the second steelmaking plant project, the 18 spearhead teams completed the 125 key projects they undertook on time or ahead of schedule.

The initial rolling mill’s pressing-down operation requires the hand, foot, eye, and brain to work in close coordination because 50-plus actions need to be completed within 60 seconds. Any slight carelessness will affect the rolling speed or result in defective products and operational accidents. Communist Party member Zhang Li Yang, who changed from being a crane foreman to a pressing-down worker in his first year, was once troubled by the high number of defective products, the long rolling time, and the high fines. However, he demanded of himself with the standard of a communist party member, turning pressure into motivation. He knew that the initial rolling mill could create 2.84 yuan for the company per second, and he was determined to attack the “second” with the spirit of “attacking the city without fear of its strength.” He carefully felt the angle and force of the operation with his hands and feet, and let others use a stopwatch to record the time of each of his actions. He asked the electrical workshop to use oscillographic photography to record his entire set of rolling operations and equipment operation processes, and then analyzed and improved them. After countless tests and long-term efforts, he finally obtained more than 5,400 data points, found the operating rules that adapted to the equipment operation, and summarized more than 6,000 characters of the best operating method. By the end of 1984, Zhang Li Yang had achieved the level of rolling 60 ingots per hour, and in 1985, he created the factory’s highest record of producing 62 ingots per hour. A foreign rolling expert used a stopwatch to measure his operation and said: “You are the most skilled operator in the world.”

The Capital Steel Party Committee clearly proposed that party members should be models of emancipating the mind and forging ahead, models of excellently completing contract tasks, models of improving ideological and moral standards, models of upholding and carrying forward good work styles, models of doing ideological work among the masses, and models of mastering advanced science and technology. Regarding the condition of “excellently completing contract tasks,” party members have given it a profound and rich connotation: the contract system is a treasure for developing productive forces, and contract tasks are personal and team commitments to the state; enterprise communist party members completing each contract task perfectly is adding bricks and tiles to socialist modernization. During the interview, I deeply felt that over the past ten years, it was the party members of Capital Steel who led the workers to create the miracle of continuous 10-year pure profit increase of 20%; in the next seven years, according to Capital Steel’s development plan, party members will continue to lead the masses to maintain this miracle for a long time. The basis for my judgment is: not only will the original 26,000 party members of Capital Steel continue to achieve merit and make contributions, but the more than 9,000 communist party members from the more than ten enterprises that have been incorporated into Capital Steel have also begun to strictly demand of themselves according to the high standards proposed by the Capital Steel Party Committee.

　　“党员无功就是过”
    ——首钢从严治党印象
    本报记者  江世杰
    “‘党员无功就是过’，首钢党委的这个口号提得太好了！在老龙头首钢承包制研修班上，我第一次听到这句话时，心里就‘格登’一下，精神为之一振！回厂后我组织党员对‘无功就是过’进行讨论，大家的感受和我一样：要建功立业，再不能把自己混同于普通老百姓了！”并入首钢不久的长白机械厂厂长兼党委书记姜士杰对记者说这些话时，脸上泛着兴奋的红光。
    首钢改革１０年，也是不断加强党的建设并以此带动和保证企业改革顺利发展的１０年。１０年来，首钢党委很好地发挥了党对企业的政治领导和保证监督作用，把从严治党作为重要的指导思想和原则，贯穿在党的思想、组织和作风建设中。
    请先看３组统计数字吧！
    一是党员队伍素质明显提高：１９８６年，有３０名党员受到北京市委表彰，２名被授予北京市优秀共产党员称号。近两年，被评为公司优秀共产党员的就有３４４２人次。基本不合格和不合格党员已由１９７９年占党员总数的１１．９％下降到０．４％。全公司９６１７名３５岁以下的青年党员中，有７０００多人参加职工业余大学和电视大学学习。
    二是党员先锋模范作用更加突出。在落实承包制中，哪里艰苦哪里就有党员冲锋陷阵，哪里关键哪里就有党员带头攻坚。１９８４年以来，首钢有４５人被评为北京市劳动模范，其中党员3７名，占８２％；１９８７年度，首钢评选四化尖兵６２名，其中党员５９名，占９５％。
    三是党的威望日益提高。１９８５年，全公司有２．４万人提出在“七五”期间争取加入党组织；党的积极分子已由１９８１年的５７００多人增加到１９８７年的１．３万多人。
    也许，这些数字和概念枯燥无味，那就再转述几个故事：
    １９８５年，首钢规划“七五”期间在距北京２００多公里以外的迁安矿区再建一个钢铁厂，公司党委决定抽调４００名党员前往支援，以弥补基建队伍中党员数量的不足。调去的这些同志，要从熟悉的岗位到生疏的岗位，从在厂房里工作变为在露天施工，从首都这样的大城市到河北省的偏僻山区，从工资保底到工资不保底（当时基建队伍是按产值提取一定比例的工资），应该说动员的任务十分艰巨，许多职工和家属也议论纷纷。但是，后来的情况却出乎意料：广大党员争相报名，纷纷请战，而且被批准的同志在几天之内就办好移交、备好行李，全部按时去报到。临行时，妻子送丈夫，子女送父亲，父亲送儿女，那场面、气氛，就像是部队上前线般壮观、热烈。
    １９８７年初，年产３００万吨的第二炼钢厂建设工程进入决战阶段，首钢有关党组织在党内挑选精兵强手，组建了１８支党员尖刀班。在一号连铸机钢结构安装最吃紧的时候，一场风雪袭来，十几米高的钢架上很快结了一指多厚的冰，给５００吨钢结构安装带来了困难。一机运公司机修车间党员尖刀班的同志，腰上系好安全带，脚上缠起防滑的破布条，一步步爬上钢架破冰开道。经过５个多小时的苦战，终于完成了任务。在第二炼钢厂工程决战期间，１８支尖刀班按时或提前完成了承担的１２５个关键项目。
    初轧机的压下工，操作时手、脚、眼、脑需紧密配合，因为在６０秒钟内要做５０多个动作，稍一疏忽，就会影响轧制速度，或者出废品和操作事故。共产党员张立洋，从天车班长改干压下工的第一年，曾以废品多、影响轧钢时间多、扣奖金多而苦恼。但是，他以共产党员的标准要求自己，把压力变成动力。他知道，初轧机一秒钟就可为公司创利２．８４元，他决心以“攻城不怕坚”的精神向“秒”攻关。他凭手、脚的感觉细心体会操作的角度和力度，让别人用秒表测记他每一个动作的时间。他请电气工段通过示波照相录下他整套轧钢动作和设备运转全过程，然后进行分析、改进。经过无数次测试和长时间努力，终于取得了５４００多个数据，摸到了适应设备运转的操作规律，总结出６０００多字的最佳操作法。１９８４年底，张立洋打出了每小时轧钢坯６０块的水平，１９８５年又创造了时产钢坯６２块的全厂最高纪录。一位外国轧钢专家用秒表测了他的操作后说：你是世界上最熟练的操作手。
    首钢党委明确提出，党员要成为解放思想、开拓进取的模范，出色完成包保任务的模范，提高思想和道德水平的模范，坚持和发扬优良作风的模范，做群众思想工作的模范，掌握先进科学技术的模范。对于“出色完成包保任务”这一条，党员又赋予它深刻而丰富的内涵：承包制是发展生产力的法宝，包保任务是个人、班组向国家立下的军令状；企业中的共产党员圆满完成每一项包保任务，就是为社会主义现代化加瓦添砖。记者在采访中深深感受到：过去１０年，正是首钢的党员带领职工群众，创造了连续１０年纯利润递增２０％的奇迹；今后７年，按照首钢的发展规划，党员们必将继续带领群众，把这种奇迹长久地保持下去。记者这一判断的依据是：不仅首钢原来的２．６万名党员会继续建功立业，而且新并入首钢的十几家企业的９０００多名共产党员，已开始按首钢党委提出的高标准严格要求自己。
