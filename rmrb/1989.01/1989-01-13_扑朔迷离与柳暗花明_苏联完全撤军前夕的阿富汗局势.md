Confusion and Hope – The Situation in Afghanistan on the Eve of the Complete Withdrawal of Soviet Troops

By Ren Yujun

There is only one month left until the date specified in the Geneva Accords for the complete withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan – February 15, 1989. The political resolution of the Afghanistan issue, which should have become clearer, has instead become confusing. All parties involved in the Afghanistan issue want to gain more leverage, making the contradictions increasingly complex:

- The negotiations between the Soviet Union and the resistance forces have been tumultuous. From Taif in Saudi Arabia to Islamabad in Pakistan, the Soviet First Deputy Foreign Minister and Ambassador to Kabul, Vorontsov, has conducted two rounds of talks with the leaders of the Afghan resistance forces. Those concerned about the situation in Afghanistan had hoped for a breakthrough in the Islamabad talks, but these talks ended without agreement, and both sides blamed each other afterward. The Soviet Union accused the resistance forces of being responsible for future bloodshed in Afghanistan. After returning to Moscow, Vorontsov told the press that, given the military situation in Afghanistan, the Soviet Union might not be able to withdraw on schedule. The Afghan resistance forces, on the other hand, stated that if the Soviet Union did not withdraw unconditionally and insisted on including the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan in the future government, the resistance forces would refuse to continue talks with the Soviet Union and would fight to the end.

- The Kabul government is dissatisfied with the Soviet Union. The Kabul government was originally dissatisfied with the Soviet Union's direct talks with the resistance forces. Additionally, the Soviet Union did not maintain its original stance of "national reconciliation with the Kabul government as the main body" during the talks but instead lowered its demands to sharing power in the future government. This made some people in the Kabul government feel that the Soviet Union had betrayed them at a critical moment and abandoned them, leading to continuous complaints. Some even, relying on advanced weapons provided by the Soviet Union, planned to launch massive bombings against the resistance forces. There is news that the Kabul government has established a new intelligence organization with 500 members to carry out sabotage against the resistance forces.

- There are differing opinions within the resistance forces. According to reports, after the talks with the Soviet Union ended, representatives of the eight-party Shia Muslim alliance based in Iran and the seven-party Sunni Muslim alliance based in Pakistan held two rounds of talks in Islamabad. Disagreements arose over the distribution of seats in the future consultative assembly. The seven-party alliance proposed allocating 60 seats to the eight-party alliance, while the eight-party alliance demanded 120. Therefore, no agreement was reached. Even within the seven-party alliance, the leadership issue has not been resolved, and they still rotate leadership every three months. For example, during the talks in Taif, it was Rabbani who led, while in Islamabad, it was Mujaddidi. There are also differing opinions within the seven-party alliance regarding the former king Zahir Shah. Some leaders even accused the new Pakistani government of changing its Afghanistan policy.

Will the above contradictions and disagreements hinder the political resolution of the Afghanistan issue or even lead to civil war? Observers here believe that the political resolution of the Afghanistan issue is an inevitable trend in the global détente, despite the twists and turns, it is irreversible.

Firstly, public opinion generally believes that the Soviet Union will withdraw on schedule. Because withdrawing on schedule is a promise the Soviet Union made to the world, while delaying the withdrawal is mainly for the benefit of the Kabul government. Weighing the pros and cons, the Soviet Union will probably not sacrifice the greater for the lesser. The Soviet Union's attitude towards the issue of negotiating with the resistance forces may also undergo some changes. Since the Soviet Union has shifted from insisting that the future government of Afghanistan should be based on the Kabul government to allowing it to be a minority in the future government, this indicates that the Soviet Union's strategy may still undergo some changes.

Moreover, the Afghan resistance forces no longer insist on resolving the issue by force and have agreed to peace talks. One reason is that they gradually realized that relying solely on military force to overthrow the Kabul government would inevitably result in more Afghan bloodshed, and the military strength of the resistance forces is limited. They excel in guerrilla warfare but are weak in attacking and defending cities. Achieving power through political means is the best choice for the resistance forces. They agreed that the future government can absorb "good Muslims" from the Kabul government and give them a considerable proportion, which undoubtedly provides flexibility for future negotiations. The current chairman of the seven-party alliance, Mujaddidi, will lead a delegation to Iran in the coming days to further consult with the eight-party alliance on the strategy for talks with the Soviet Union and coordinate the resistance forces' opinions on the future government. As a Pakistani official said, both the Soviet Union and the resistance forces making some concessions, the peaceful resolution of the Afghanistan issue remains highly hopeful.

Furthermore, the United Nations will actively participate in the peaceful resolution of the Afghanistan issue. In November last year, 159 member states unanimously adopted a resolution on the resolution of the Afghanistan issue at the United Nations General Assembly. UN Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar has repeatedly stated that he believes the Afghan people can solve their own problems without external interference, and he is also willing to do everything possible to help the Afghanistan issue achieve a political resolution. His newly appointed representative for the Afghanistan issue, Benno Sevan, will fly to New York next week to discuss with the Secretary-General himself how the United Nations can play a role in making the negotiating parties understand each other.

"After the mountain path ends, there is still a village with willows and flowers." People hope that the Afghanistan issue will be resolved peacefully as soon as possible.

### 扑朔迷离与柳暗花明——苏联完全撤军前夕的阿富汗局势

　　扑朔迷离与柳暗花明
    ——苏联完全撤军前夕的阿富汗局势
    本报记者  任毓骏
    距离日内瓦协议规定的苏军完全撤出阿富汗的日期——１９８９年２月１５日只有整整一个月了，本应该逐渐明朗的政治解决阿富汗问题的前景，却又变得扑朔迷离。阿富汗问题的有关各方都想从中多得到一些筹码，各种矛盾因此变得错综复杂：
    ——苏联与抵抗力量谈判一波三折。从沙特阿拉伯塔伊夫到巴基斯坦伊斯兰堡，苏联第一副外长、驻喀布尔大使沃龙佐夫和阿富汗抵抗力量领导人已进行了两轮谈判。关心阿富汗局势的人们寄希望于伊斯兰堡谈判，但这次谈判却不欢而散，而且在会谈后双方都推卸责任并攻击对方。苏联指责抵抗力量要为今后阿富汗境内的流血负责，沃龙佐夫回到莫斯科后向新闻界发表谈话说，鉴于阿富汗的军事形势，苏联可能不能按期撤军。阿富汗抵抗力量则表示，如苏联不无条件撤军并坚持让阿人民民主党参与未来政府，抵抗力量将拒绝与苏联继续谈判并把圣战进行到底。
    ——喀布尔政权对苏联表示不满。喀布尔政权对苏联与抵抗力量开始直接谈判本来就不满，再加上苏联在谈判中没有坚持原先的“以喀布尔政权为主体的民族和解”的立场，而是降格为要求人民民主党在未来政府中“分享权力”。这使喀布尔政权中一些人感到苏联在关键时刻背信弃义，撒手不管，因而抱怨之声不绝。更有一些人自恃有苏联援助的先进武器，要对抵抗力量狂轰滥炸。有消息说，喀布尔政权已成立一个拥有５００名成员的新特务组织，以对抵抗力量采取破坏行动。
    ——抵抗力量内部意见不尽一致。据报道，与苏联谈判结束以后，以伊朗为基地的什叶派穆斯林八党联盟的代表和以巴基斯坦为基地的逊尼派穆斯林七党联盟在伊斯兰堡举行了两轮会谈。双方在未来的协商性议会中的席位分配发生争议。七党联盟提议分配给八党联盟６０个席位，而八党联盟则要求占有１２０个。因而双方没有达成协议。就是在七党联盟内部，领导权问题仍未解决，依然采取轮流坐庄制，３个月一换。例如同苏联谈判，在塔伊夫时是拉巴尼为首，在伊斯兰堡则换成穆贾迪迪。七党联盟中对前国王查希尔的态度也有分歧。有一派别领导人还指责巴基斯坦新政府的阿富汗政策有了变化。
    上述矛盾和分歧会不会阻碍阿富汗问题的政治解决甚至导致内战？此间观察家认为，政治解决阿富汗问题是世界缓和潮流的大势所趋，虽有波澜曲折，但终归不可逆转。
    首先，舆论普遍认为，苏联将按期撤军。因为如期撤军是苏联对全世界的许诺，而推迟撤军则主要是为了喀布尔政权。权衡利弊，苏联大概不会因小失大的。苏联对待同抵抗力量谈判问题的态度，也可能发生某些变化。既然苏联能从坚持阿富汗未来政府以喀布尔政权为主转变到让它作未来政府中的少数派，那就说明苏联的策略还有可能作一定的改变。
    另外，阿富汗抵抗力量已不再坚持以武力解决问题而同意和平谈判。其中一个原因是他们逐步认识到仅凭军事力量推翻喀布尔政权必然要造成更多的阿富汗人流血，而且抵抗力量的军事实力有限，打游击占优势，但攻城和守城都力不从心，能通过政治解决而取得政权是抵抗力量的最佳选择。他们同意未来的政府可以吸收喀布尔政权中“表现好的穆斯林”参加并给以相当的比例，这无疑为未来的谈判提供了变通的余地。现任七党联盟主席穆贾迪迪将于日内率团前往伊朗，和八党联盟进一步磋商对苏谈判战略和协调抵抗力量对未来政府的意见。正如一位巴基斯坦官员所说，苏联和抵抗力量两方面各自作一些让步，和平解决阿富汗问题仍是大有希望的。
    再者，联合国将积极参与和平解决阿富汗问题。去年１１月份，１５９个成员国一致通过了联合国大会关于解决阿富汗问题的决议。联合国秘书长德奎利亚尔多次表示，他相信阿富汗人能在没有外来干涉的情况下解决自己的问题，他也愿意尽一切力量协助阿富汗问题得到政治解决。他新委任的有关阿富汗问题的代表本诺·塞万下周将飞赴纽约，和秘书长本人商讨关于“联合国将如何发挥作用，使谈判双方互相理解。”
    “山穷水复疑无路，柳暗花明又一村。”人们希望阿富汗问题尽早得到和平解决。
