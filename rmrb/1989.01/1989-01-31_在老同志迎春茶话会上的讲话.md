		Speech at the Spring Tea Gathering for Senior Comrades
		Zhao Ziyang
		(January 30, 1989)

		Comrades,

		The traditional Chinese New Year is approaching. Today, the Central Advisory Commission, the Central Organization Department, the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army, and the Beijing Municipal Committee are holding a spring tea gathering for senior comrades. On behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, I would like to extend New Year's greetings to all the senior comrades present and to all retired and retired senior comrades across the country!

		As families across the nation celebrate the New Year, people naturally think of how it was the older generation of revolutionaries who, through their blood, toil, and long-term efforts, created and won the peace, stability, and prosperity we enjoy today. The merits of the senior comrades for the Chinese revolution and construction will be forever inscribed in history, and generations to come will never forget them. The Party and the government thank you, the military thanks you, and the people thank you!

		Comrades are all concerned about the current situation and work. I would like to take this opportunity to give a brief report to the senior comrades present.

		Everyone knows that since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, our country has been carrying out reforms. Ten years of reform have greatly enhanced our country's economic and technological strength, significantly improved the people's living standards, and brought about tremendous changes in the overall appearance of the country. The significance of the reform lies not only in the achievements we have made, but more importantly, we are exploring and establishing a new system that can both promote the development of social productive forces and give full play to our political advantages, continuously improve socialist democracy and the legal system, and further demonstrate the superiority of the socialist system. Of course, this is a tortuous and difficult road, and the task is extremely arduous and complex. On such a road, it is impossible to completely avoid any setbacks and mistakes. However, we have indeed achieved great success. By 1990, the task of doubling the national income has been completed ahead of schedule, proving that the direction we have chosen is correct and that the basic line our Party has formulated is correct. As long as we firmly adhere to the line since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee and pay timely attention to solving new problems, we will continue to achieve new successes, and the set goals will definitely be realized.

		Comrade Deng Xiaoping has repeatedly said that we must insist on two-pronged efforts. Now, we are indeed focusing on one hand to develop socialist commodity economy and productive forces, and on the other hand to focus on work in the ideological and political fields. If we do not develop the commodity economy, we can only have a poor socialism and cannot demonstrate the superiority of the socialist system; if we do not focus on work in the ideological and political fields, society will not be stable, and various negative and corrupt phenomena that exist in capitalist societies, especially those that prevailed in the early stages of capitalist commodity economy development, will grow. We are a socialist country, and we have the conditions to both develop the commodity economy and prevent negative and corrupt phenomena from growing. The premise is that we must insist on two-pronged efforts.

		In September last year, the Third Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee formulated the policy of "improving the economic environment, rectifying the economic order, and deepening the reform comprehensively," and decided to focus on rectification and order for the next two years of reform and construction. Since then, the Party Central Committee and the State Council have taken a series of measures, and the rectification and order have begun to show results. Of course, it is still preliminary, and the work must not be relaxed, and we must continue to work hard and solidly.

		While deploying rectification and order, the Third Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee also emphasized strengthening and improving the Party's leadership and giving full play to our political advantages. Accordingly, we have focused on several items of work in this period. Regarding the issues of Party style and clean governance, the Secretariat conducted in-depth investigations and research, held special discussions, and issued a circular. At the end of December last year, the Central Committee convened a national party member education work conference to discuss and deploy the issues of party member education and strengthening party building. In mid-January this year, a national political and legal work symposium was held to study the issues of upholding people's democratic dictatorship, strengthening socialist legal system construction, and comprehensive treatment of social security. In late January, a national discipline inspection work conference was held to discuss and deploy the strengthening of Party style and discipline construction in the rectification, order, adjustment, and reform according to the principle of strict Party governance. From January 4th to the end of the month this year, the Central Committee organized a group of provincial party secretaries and deputy secretaries to the Central Party School for a party building research class, and conducted in-depth discussions on the issues of strengthening the Party's ideological and organizational construction.

		The Central Committee believes that in building socialism with Chinese characteristics, it is not enough to focus on developing the socialist commodity economy; it is not enough to focus on work in the ideological and political fields while developing the commodity economy; and it is not enough to focus on Party building while focusing on work in the ideological and political fields. In the current Party building work, it is especially necessary to seriously solve several prominent problems, such as: under the conditions of reform, opening up, and developing the commodity economy, maintaining the integrity of Party members and cadres, and maintaining close ties between the Party and the masses; maintaining the unity of the whole Party's ideology on major political principles, and enhancing the cohesion within the Party; maintaining strict and unified discipline among all Party members (regardless of the work they do and the positions they hold), and overcoming dispersion; through improving and strengthening the Party's leadership, enhancing the Party's attractiveness to the people. In the new situation, Party building does have many new problems, but as long as it starts from the Central Committee, various levels of Party committees seriously grasp it, and put it on the important agenda, there will be ways and experiences, and it can be grasped effectively. The facts have proven this.

		The above-mentioned work in various aspects will be continued by the Central Committee, and we hope to receive the strong support of the senior comrades. Senior comrades have high prestige, wide influence, and rich experience, and are a valuable asset of the Party. The Central Committee requires that various levels of Party committees further attach importance to the work of retired cadres, care for and love the senior comrades politically and in their lives, seriously listen to the opinions and suggestions of the senior comrades, and create conditions for the senior comrades to participate in activities that are within their abilities and suitable for their personal characteristics. We should further advocate and carry forward the fine tradition of respecting the elderly in the Chinese nation throughout the Party and society.

		The realization of the Four Modernizations and the rejuvenation of China requires the joint efforts and persistent struggle of the old, middle, and young generations. The whole Party and the whole nation should unite as one, strive for self-improvement, and strive unremittingly, generation after generation, to carry on and open up new frontiers. The rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is bound to be realized.

		Finally, I wish everyone a happy holiday and good health!

　　在老同志迎春茶话会上的讲话    
    赵紫阳
    （一九八九年一月三十日）
    同志们：
    我国人民的传统节日春节就要到了。今天，中央顾问委员会、中央组织部、解放军总政治部、北京市委，在这里举行老同志迎春茶话会，我代表中共中央、国务院、中央军委，给在座的各位同志和全国离休、退休的所有老同志拜个早年，向大家致以节日的问候！
    当全国千家万户欢度春节的时候，人们很自然地会想到，正是老一辈革命者浴血奋斗、长期努力，才创造和赢得了今天的和平、安定和繁荣。老同志为中国革命和建设立下的功勋将永垂青史，世世代代都不会忘记。党和政府感谢你们，军队感谢你们，人民感谢你们！
    同志们都很关心当前的形势和工作。我想利用今天这个机会，向到会的老同志作一个简要的通报。
    大家都知道，自从党的十一届三中全会以来，我国一直在进行改革。十年改革，使我国的经济技术力量大大增强，人民生活显著改善，整个国家的面貌发生了巨大的变化。改革的意义，还不仅在于已经取得的成就，更重要的是我们正在探索和建立一种既能促进社会生产力发展，又能发挥我们的政治优势，使社会主义民主和法制不断完善，使社会主义制度的优越性进一步显示出来的新体制。当然，这是一条曲折而又充满困难的道路，任务是极为艰巨复杂的。在这样一条道路上，要想完全避免任何挫折和失误是不可能的。但是，我们毕竟已经取得了巨大的成就，到１９９０年国民生产总值翻一番的任务已提前完成，证明我们选择的方向是对的，证明我们党所制定的基本路线是正确的。只要我们坚定不移地沿着十一届三中全会以来的路线走下去，并及时注意解决新的问题，我们就将不断取得新的成就，既定的目标一定能够达到。
    小平同志多次讲，必须坚持两手抓。现在，我们就是一手抓发展社会主义商品经济，发展生产力，一手抓思想和政治领域的工作。如果不发展商品经济，就只能是贫穷的社会主义，就显示不出社会主义制度的优越性；如果不抓思想和政治领域的工作，社会就不能安定，资本主义社会存在的、特别是资本主义商品经济发展初期盛行的各种消极腐败现象就会滋长起来。我们是社会主义国家，有条件做到既发展商品经济，又不让消极腐败现象发展起来。前提是必须坚持两手抓。
    去年９月，党的十三届三中全会制定了“治理经济环境，整顿经济秩序，全面深化改革”的方针，确定把今明两年改革和建设的重点放到治理和整顿上来。此后，党中央和国务院相继采取一系列措施，治理、整顿开始取得成效。当然还是初步的，工作决不可放松，还必须继续努力，扎扎实实地抓下去。
    十三届三中全会在部署治理、整顿的同时，还强调要加强和改进党的领导，发挥我们的政治优势。据此，我们在这一段时间陆续抓了几项工作。围绕党风建设和廉政建设问题，中央进行了多方面的调查和研究，书记处进行专门讨论，发了纪要。去年１２月底，中央召开全国党员教育工作会议，讨论部署了党员教育和加强党的建设的问题。今年１月中旬，召开全国政法工作座谈会，研究了坚持人民民主专政，加强社会主义法制建设，对社会治安进行综合治理的问题。１月下旬，召开全国纪检工作会议，按照从严治党的方针，讨论和部署在治理、整顿、调整、改革中进一步加强党风党纪建设。从今年１月４日开始到月底，中央把一部分省委书记、副书记，集中到中央党校，举办党的建设研究班，深入讨论了加强党的思想建设和组织建设的问题。
    中央认为，建设有中国特色的社会主义，不抓发展社会主义商品经济不行；抓商品经济而不抓思想政治领域的工作不行；抓思想政治领域而不以党的建设为重点也不行。在当前党的建设工作中，特别需要认真解决几个突出的问题，如：在改革、开放和发展商品经济的条件下，保持党员干部的廉洁，密切党与群众的关系；在重大政治原则问题上，保持全党思想的统一，增强党内的凝聚力；在全体党员中（不管从事何种工作和担任何种职务），保持严格的统一的纪律，克服涣散现象；通过改善和加强党的领导，来增强党在人民群众中的吸引力等等。在新形势下，党的建设确有不少新问题，但是只要从中央开始，各级党委认真去抓，摆到重要日程上来，就会有办法、有经验，就能抓出成效来。事实已经证明了这一点。
    以上各方面的工作，中央将会继续抓下去，并希望得到老同志的大力支持。老同志有很高的威望、广泛的影响和丰富的经验，是党的宝贵财富。中央要求各级党委进一步重视老干部工作，从政治上、生活上关心爱护老同志，认真听取老同志的意见和建议，为老同志参加力所能及的、适合个人特点的活动创造条件。要在全党全社会进一步提倡和发扬中华民族尊老敬老的优良传统。
    实现四化、振兴中华，需要老中青几代人的共同努力，持续奋斗。我们全党全民族要同心同德，发奋图强，一代接一代，继往开来，百折不挠地奋斗下去。中华民族的振兴是一定能够实现的。
    最后，祝愿大家节日愉快，健康长寿！
