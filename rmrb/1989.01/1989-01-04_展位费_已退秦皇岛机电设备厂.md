Your newspaper published a letter to the editor titled "Why Was the Exhibition Fee Not Refunded?" on November 5, 1988, on the fifth page. After investigation, it was found that this was due to the lack of responsibility and negligence of our financial staff. We have severely criticized the financial staff and, on November 14, refunded 800 yuan in exhibition fees to Qinhuangdao Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Factory through the bank. At the same time, we apologized to them.

　　“展位费”已退秦皇岛机电设备厂
    你报１９８８年１１月５日第五版刊登题为《为何不退“展位费”？》的读者来信。经查，这是由于我们的财务人员工作责任心不强、工作失职造成的。我们已对财务人员进行了严肃批评，并于１１月１４日通过银行退回了秦皇岛机电设备厂的８００元展位费，同时向他们作了道歉。
