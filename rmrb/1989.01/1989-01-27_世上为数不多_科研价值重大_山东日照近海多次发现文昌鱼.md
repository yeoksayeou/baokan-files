The State Oceanic Administration's First Institute of Oceanography and the Science and Technology Commission of Rizhao City, Shandong Province, have discovered the rare marine animal, the filefish, multiple times in the waters near Qian San Island, southeast of Shitou Harbor, during their island surveys.

The filefish belongs to the chordate phylum and has significant scientific value. It is a valuable resource for studying biological evolution, embryology, and cell biology, often referred to as a "living fossil." This fish prefers to inhabit shallow sandy beaches and has strict requirements for its marine habitat. Currently, it is scarce worldwide, and in China, it has only been found in a few places such as Xiamen and Qingdao.

The filefish discovered in the coastal waters of Rizhao cover an area of 180 square kilometers, with the highest density reaching 390 fish per square meter. This wide distribution and high density are quite rare in China. Except for winter, they can be collected in the other three seasons. After identification, it was confirmed to be the Qingdao species of filefish.

　　世上为数不多　科研价值重大    
    山东日照近海多次发现文昌鱼
    本报讯  记者舒小骅报道：国家海洋局第一海洋研究所和山东省日照市科委在海岛调查中，多次于石臼港东南的前三岛水域采集到海洋珍稀动物——文昌鱼。
    文昌鱼属于脊索动物，有重要的科研价值。它是研究生物进化、胚胎学和细胞生物学的宝贵资源，被称为“活化石”。这种鱼习惯栖息于浅海沙滩中，对海洋生存环境要求很严，目前在世界上数量不多，我国也只有在厦门和青岛等局部海域发现过。
    在日照近海发现的文昌鱼分布面积有１８０平方公里，栖息密度最高达每平方米３９０条，其分布之广、密度之大在我国较为罕见。除冬季外，其它三季皆可采集。经鉴定，系青岛文昌鱼种。
