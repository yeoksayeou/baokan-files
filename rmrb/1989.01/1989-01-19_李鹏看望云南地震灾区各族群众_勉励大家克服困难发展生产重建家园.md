Li Peng visits ethnic minorities in Yunnan earthquake-stricken areas and encourages them to overcome difficulties, develop production, and rebuild homes

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, January 18 (Reporters Zhang Dian Guang, Luo Ping) Premier Li Peng inspected the earthquake-stricken areas in Yunnan and comforted the affected ethnic minorities.

On January 17, Premier Li Peng flew from Kunming to Gengma Dai and Wa Autonomous County, Cangyuan Wa Autonomous County, and Lancang Lahu Autonomous County by helicopter to inspect the earthquake relief work and comfort local officials and residents.

At 10:30 AM, Premier Li Peng arrived in Gengma County, where almost all the houses had collapsed. He inspected the damage to the houses on both sides of the street. He saw ethnic minorities dressed in bright clothes orderly and happily shopping and doing business in front of piles of rubble. He told the provincial leaders, "Social order is stable, and the people's spirits are good, which is important for earthquake relief and production recovery." He inquired about the prices of vegetables, side dishes, and local snacks and was pleased to hear that the prices were not high. In the courtyard of the county government, he saw the temporary offices neatly arranged and praised the local and county officials accompanying him, saying, "You've done a great job. You should make do with what you have and quickly restore normal order." He then went to a primary school and suggested visiting the teachers, but unfortunately, the owners were all at the market. He then asked the principal about the casualties of teachers and students, the resumption of classes, and the current living situation. He instructed them to be careful with fire prevention and safety when living in tents. The news of Li Peng's arrival quickly spread through the bustling streets of Gengma, and many residents waited at the county hospital to welcome him. Li Peng warmly greeted everyone, saying, "Hello!" Many residents were moved to tears and clapped, saying, "Premier, you're good!"

At noon, Premier Li Peng drove to Mengshan Town and Mengshan Farm in Cangyuan County, about 30 kilometers from Gengma City. The winter sun in the subtropical region was still scorching. Premier Li Peng took off his coat and sweater one by one, but his face was still sweaty. He walked on the road filled with ruins, the dust choking him, but he paid no mind. After inspecting the street, he went into a factory. In front of the tea factory that had been leveled to the ground, he learned that this was a severely affected area with a seismic intensity of 10 degrees. He then inquired about the casualties of the workers and whether their living arrangements were proper. At the home of worker Zhou Yiliang, he asked about the damage to his family and why the television on the table was tied with a rope. Zhou Yiliang replied that aftershocks were still frequent. He asked anxiously, "Are you afraid?" Upon hearing the reply, "We've endured the big quake, we're not afraid of the small ones," he nodded reassuringly. He looked around the makeshift tent and asked with some concern, "Can such houses withstand the winter and rain?" Upon hearing that they needed to be reinforced, he encouraged them, saying, "I hope everyone can overcome difficulties, develop production, and rebuild their homes."

At 3 PM, Premier Li Peng arrived in Lancang County by helicopter. After getting off the plane, he firmly shook hands with County Party Secretary Li Meide and County Magistrate Zhang Zhongde, saying, "You've worked hard! You've worked hard!" The two Lahu ethnic officials were moved to tears and presented Li Peng with a Lahu shoulder bag symbolizing good fortune, respect, and hospitality. At Lancang County People's Hospital, Li Peng visited 44 severely injured patients who had not yet recovered from the earthquake. He comforted the injured, saying, "Rest assured and believe that the doctors will heal your injuries." He also thanked the medical staff present, saying, "You've worked hard, thank you all."

At Lancang County First Middle School, he stood in front of the cracked classroom building and asked the principal, "Can the classroom building be repaired?" The principal replied, "Experts have come to inspect, and it can be repaired." Li Peng said, "Good, if it can be repaired, we should repair it as much as possible. This way, we can save time and money."

Before leaving, Li Peng told the leaders of Simao Region and Lancang, Ximeng, and Menglian Autonomous Counties, "The spirit of the people in the disaster areas is good. With this, we can overcome difficulties. The central government and the province will do their best to help you, but you must be prepared to work hard with the people for a few years, to self-reliantly rebuild your homes."

Premier Li Peng arrived in Kunming in the evening of January 16. Accompanying him to comfort the disaster victims were Wang Renzhong, Secretary of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Governor He Zhiqiang, as well as officials from the Ministry of Civil Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, the State Planning Commission, and the Ministry of Commerce.

　　李鹏看望云南地震灾区各族群众
    勉励大家克服困难发展生产重建家园
    新华社昆明１月１８日电  （记者张殿光、罗苹）国务院总理李鹏视察云南地震灾区，慰问受灾的各族群众。
    １月１７日，李鹏总理由昆明乘直升飞机先后到耿马傣族佤族自治县、沧源佤族自治县、澜沧拉祜族自治县视察抗震救灾工作情况，慰问当地干部和群众。
    上午１０时半，李鹏总理到达房屋几乎全部倒塌的耿马县城，察看了街道两旁房屋损坏情况。他看到穿着鲜艳的各族群众在一堆堆瓦砾前秩序井然、高高兴兴地赶街子、做买卖，他对省领导同志说，社会秩序安定，人民的精神状态很好，这对抗震救灾、恢复生产很重要。他关心地打听蔬菜、副食品、风味小吃的价格，听到报价不高，十分高兴。在县政府院子里，看见临时搭起来的办公室整齐有序，他称赞陪同的地县干部说：“你们干得很快，就是要因陋就简，迅速恢复正常秩序”。走进小学校，李鹏总理提议去看望教师，可惜连走几家，主人都赶集去了。他便向校长询问师生伤亡、复课以及现在生活的情况，嘱咐住油毛毡棚要注意防火，注意安全。李鹏总理到来的消息在耿马热闹的大街上飞快传开，许多群众等在县医院门口欢迎。李鹏总理亲切地问候大家说：“你们好！”许多群众情绪激动地鼓起掌来，纷纷说：“总理好！”
    中午，李鹏总理驱车到达距耿马城近３０公里的沧源县勐省镇、勐省农场。亚热带地区冬日的阳光仍很火辣，李鹏总理连续脱去外衣、毛衣，仍然脸上冒汗。在满目废墟的路上步行，尘土呛人，但他毫不介意，看完街道又转进工厂。在农场被夷为平地的茶厂前，他得知这里是地震烈度达到１０度的重灾点，就关切地询问职工伤亡情况和职工生活是否安排妥当。在职工周以良家，关切地问到他家的损失情况，问桌上的电视机为什么用绳子拴着，周以良答这里余震仍很频繁。他有些不安地问：“你们怕吗？”待听到“大震都抗过来了，小震不怕”的回答，他宽心地点点头。他环视简易的油毛毡棚，又有些担心地问：“这样的房子能否过冬、避雨？”听说还需要加固，他便勉励说：“希望大家克服困难，发展生产，重建好家园。”
    下午３时，李鹏总理乘直升飞机抵达澜沧县。下机后，他紧紧握住县委书记李美德和县长张忠德的手说：“你们辛苦了！你们辛苦了！”这两位拉祜族干部激动得眼眶湿润，向李鹏总理献上象征吉祥如意、尊敬客人的拉祜挎包。在澜沧县人民医院，李鹏总理看望了在地震中受重伤、至今未痊愈的４４名伤员。他劝慰伤病员“安心养伤，相信医生一定会把大家的伤病治好。”同时对在场的医务人员说：“你们辛苦了，谢谢大家。”
    在澜沧县第一中学，他站在被震裂的教学楼前问校长：“教学楼能修复吗？”校长回答说：“专家来鉴定过了，能修复。”李鹏总理说：“好，能修复的就要尽量修复，这样既能争取时间，又能少花钱多办事。”
    临别时，李鹏总理对思茅地区和澜沧、西盟、孟连自治县的领导同志说：“灾区群众的精神面貌很好，有这一条就能克服困难。中央和省里要尽力帮助你们，但你们要准备和群众一起艰苦奋斗几年，生产自救，自力更生，重建家园。”
    李鹏总理是１６日傍晚抵达昆明的。陪同他到灾区慰问灾民的，有中共云南省委书记普朝柱、省长和志强以及民政部、财政部、国家计委、商业部等部门的负责同志。
