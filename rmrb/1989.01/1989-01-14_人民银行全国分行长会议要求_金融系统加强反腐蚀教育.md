The People's Bank of China's National Branch Managers' Meeting Calls for Strengthening Anti-Corruption Education in the Financial System

	People's Daily reports: Correspondents Mei Hongru and Dong Huanliang report: The financial system must strengthen ideological and political work, resist the improper trend of using power for personal gain, and fight against corrupt behavior to comprehensively improve the political and professional qualities of employees. This was pointed out by State Councilor Li Guixian at the meeting of the People's Bank of China's national branch managers held on January 12.

	In recent years, the number of employees in the financial system has rapidly increased. By 1988, the total number of employees in various banks, insurance companies, and urban and rural credit cooperatives and other non-bank financial institutions had reached nearly 2 million, an increase of 4.5 times compared to 1978.

	The vast number of cadres and employees in the financial system have played a significant role in supporting reform, developing the economy, and stabilizing finance. However, some cadres and employees have not adapted their thinking to the new situation and lack the ability to resist corruption. In recent years, the incidence of economic cases in the financial system has been relatively high. By the end of September 1988, the system had discovered 1,200 major cases involving more than 2,000 yuan, with more than 40% of these being major cases involving more than 10,000 yuan. At the same time, the trend of using one's position and work for personal gain, such as extorting from enterprises, has also been on the rise. Some cadres lack organizational discipline and do not follow orders or prohibitions. The occurrence of the above problems, in addition to influences from society, is an important reason why some departments and units in the financial system have weak ideological and political work and have relaxed education and training for employees.

	Comrade Li Guixian emphasized that the financial system should include team building in its important work agenda, insist on combining business with ideological and political work, and integrate them into one. According to the new requirements and tests posed by reform and opening up for cadres and employees, in-depth anti-corruption education and professional ethics education should be carried out to enable cadres and employees to establish a spirit of dedication to the Four Modernizations, strengthen legal and disciplinary awareness, and thus model the implementation of policies in the treatment of the economic environment and the rectification of economic order, ensuring the smooth implementation of policies. In the anti-corruption campaign focusing on combating bribery, various levels of leadership organs and leading cadres should be the key, and various levels of organs should be built into clean and efficient organs. Various financial supervision organs should concentrate their efforts on investigating some cases to achieve the effect of investigating one case and educating a large area.

　　人民银行全国分行长会议要求
    金融系统加强反腐蚀教育
    本报讯  记者梅洪如、董焕亮报道：金融系统要加强思想政治工作，抵制以权谋私的不正之风，与腐败行为作斗争，全面提高职工的政治、业务素质。这是国务委员李贵鲜在１月１２日召开的人民银行全国分行长会议上指出的。
    近几年，金融系统的职工迅速增加。到１９８８年，各家银行、保险公司，加上城乡信用社等非银行金融机构，职工已发展到近２００万，比１９７８年增加４．５倍。
    金融系统广大干部、职工在支持改革、发展经济、稳定金融方面起了很大作用，但也有些干部、职工思想不适应新形势，缺乏拒腐蚀能力。近年来，金融系统经济案件发案率较高。到１９８８年９月底止，全系统发现２０００元以上的大案要案１２００件，其中万元以上的特大案件占４０％多。与此同时，利用职务和工作之便，向企业吃、拿、卡、要等不正之风也有抬头。有的干部组织性、纪律性差，有令不行，有禁不止。发生上述问题，除来自社会上的影响外，金融系统一些部门和单位思想政治工作薄弱，放松对职工的教育和培训是一个重要原因。
    李贵鲜同志强调，金融系统要把队伍建设列入重要工作日程，坚持业务与思想政治工作一起抓，互相渗透，融为一体。要根据改革、开放对干部职工提出的新要求、新考验，深入进行反腐蚀教育和职业道德教育，使干部职工树立为四化而奋斗的奉献精神，加强法制观念、纪律观念，从而在治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序中模范地执行政策，确保政令畅通。在开展以反贪污受贿为重点的反腐蚀斗争中，要把各级领导机关和领导干部作为重点，把各级机关建成廉洁高效的机关。各金融监察机关要集中力量查处一些案件，达到查处一案，教育一片的效果。
