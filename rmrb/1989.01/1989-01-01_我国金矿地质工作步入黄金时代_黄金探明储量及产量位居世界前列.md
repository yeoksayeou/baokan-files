China's gold mining geological work is thriving and has entered a golden age. Gold reserves have increased exponentially, and gold production is developing rapidly. Over the past decade, production has increased by 10% annually. Both production and reserves have placed China among the world's major gold resource and producing countries.

Since the beginning of the "Seventh Five-Year Plan," geological work in gold mining has made unprecedented progress in management by implementing a system where reserves are contracted, and investment is linked to reserve outcomes. Building on the long-term accumulated geological work, significant advancements have been made. The number of exploration teams has increased from 52,000 in 1985 to 88,000. The annual discovery rate has set historical records, with the reserves discovered in 1986 and 1987 exceeding the total reserves discovered during the "Sixth Five-Year Plan" by 5%. The southwest of Guizhou, the northwest of Guangxi, the southeast of Yunnan, and the "golden triangles" in Gansu, Sichuan, and Shaanxi are forming China's two major gold mining bases. The middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River have discovered large copper-gold deposits and a number of iron-capped gold deposits. Significant breakthroughs have been made in the exploration of the Ailao Mountains in Yunnan, the northern and western fringes of the Junggar Basin in Xinjiang, and new gold mining belts are expected to form.

There have been breakthroughs in gold exploration methods and testing technologies. The Henan Provincial Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources successfully developed the trace gold chemical spectroscopy testing technology, and Zhejiang and Heilongjiang provinces created rapid field testing methods for trace gold, advancing geological chemical prospecting from the indirect gold-finding stage to the direct gold-finding stage.

In terms of relying on technological progress and strengthening geological research on gold mines, significant achievements have also been made. A number of new large-scale national gold mining geological research projects have been approved and will soon be implemented.

　　我国金矿地质工作步入黄金时代
    黄金探明储量及产量位居世界前列
    本报讯  记者杨涌报道：我国金矿地质工作正欣欣向荣，处于黄金时代。黄金储量成倍增长，黄金生产发展迅速。１０年来生产以每年１０％的速度递增。产量和储量均已进入世界主要金矿资源国和产金国之列。
    “七五”以来的３年，金矿地质工作在管理上实行储量承包，投入与储量成果挂钩，在过去长期积累的地质工作基础上，取得了前所未有的进展。找矿队伍从１９８５年的５．２万人增加到８．８万人；年探明量创历史纪录，１９８６年、１９８７年探明的储量比“六五”期间探明的总储量还多５％。黔西南、桂西北、滇东南和甘肃、四川、陕西两个“金三角”正形成我国两大金矿基地；长江中下游地带找到了大型的铜金矿床和一批铁帽金矿床；云南哀牢山、新疆准噶尔北、西缘探矿都有重大突破，预计将形成新的金矿带。
    金矿找矿方法和测试技术取得突破性进展。河南省地矿局研究成功的痕量金化学光谱法测试技术，浙江省、黑龙江省等创造的痕量金野外快速测定方法，使地球化学勘查方法由间接找金阶段进入了直接以金找金阶段。
    在依靠科技进步，加强金矿地质科学研究方面，亦取得了好成果。一批新的大型的全国金矿地质科研项目经过论证，不久将组织实施。
