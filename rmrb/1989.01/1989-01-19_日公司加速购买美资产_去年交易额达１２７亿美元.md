Japanese companies accelerated their purchases of U.S. assets last year due to the appreciation of the yen and restrictions in the domestic market.

According to a recent report by the Wall Street Journal, Japanese companies conducted 130 mergers and acquisitions in the U.S. last year, with a total transaction value of $12.7 billion. This is a significant increase from the 4 deals and $590 million in transactions in 1987. It is expected that this trend will continue this year.

Last year, Japanese companies engaged in more large-scale mergers in the U.S. compared to 1987. In these mergers, 6 deals had transaction values exceeding $500 million. The largest transaction was Bridgestone Tire Company's acquisition of Firestone Tire Company for $2.6 billion.

Last year, Japanese companies' mergers and acquisitions in the U.S. primarily targeted American manufacturing companies and financial institutions. U.S. merger experts noted that Japanese companies are willing to pay high prices for American companies, not just to find lower-cost production bases or stable sales channels, but also because American assets are much cheaper than those in Japan.

　　日公司加速购买美资产
    去年交易额达１２７亿美元
    新华社华盛顿１月１７日电  由于日元升值和受国内市场的限制，去年日本公司加速购买美国资产。
    据《华尔街日报》最近报道，去年，日本公司在美国进行的兼并及其他有关交易达１３０项，交易额达１２７亿美元，大大超过了１９８７年的４例和５９亿美元的交易额。预计今年仍将保持这一增长势头。
    去年，日本公司在美国进行的大规模兼并也比１９８７年多。去年日本公司在美国的兼并活动中，有６项的交易额在５亿美元以上，其中最大的一项交易是日本的布里奇斯通轮胎公司以２６亿美元的价格收购了美国的费尔斯通轮胎公司。
    去年，日本公司在美国的兼并活动主要是收购美国的制造业企业和金融公司。美国的企业兼并专家说，日本公司愿意以高价购买美国公司，不仅仅是为了寻找一个成本较低的生产基地或稳定的销售渠道，也是因为美国的资产比日本国内的资产要便宜得多。
