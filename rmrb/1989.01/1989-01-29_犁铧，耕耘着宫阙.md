Title: Plowshare, Cultivating the Imperial Palace

I lie quietly on the ruins of the ancient city of Zhongdu.

It is autumn, and it is dusk. The feeble setting sun paints the broken walls and bricks with a bloody hue. The shimmering waters that were once the moat of the Zhongdu Forbidden City are now divided into small lakes, where blue, yellow, and red flags flutter in the twilight.

Is this the imperial city that the beggar monk, who became an emperor, built on this desolate and impoverished land in Fengyang? People only know of the Forbidden City in Beijing, but they do not know that the Forbidden City in Beijing is merely a very crude copy of this one!

“That is the East Gate, and that is the West Gate!” I gaze at the crumbling city gates, guessing in my mind. The mountain to the north should be the “Mountain of Longevity,” positioned much like the Jingshan Hill behind the Forbidden City in Beijing. If the capital had not been moved to Beijing, perhaps the rope that hanged the Ming dynasty would have been hung on this “Mountain of Longevity.”

The Meridian Gate is right beneath my feet, the gate tower long gone, with only some weathered stone foundations visible among the weeds. The Altar of the Earth, the Temple of Ancestors, the Gate of Heavenly Peace, the Golden Water River, the Hongwu Gate, and the Circular Mound Altar are arranged in sequence from the Meridian Gate to the south. These magnificent structures, once sacred and off-limits to commoners, are now reduced to mud, or piled with manure, or churned into waves of earth, with green, needle-like wheat sprouts showing vigorous life.

Nearby, I hear the farmer shouting at his ox. I follow the sound down from the city wall and see a farmer guiding his plow. Was this once the Hall of Supreme Harmony, the Hall of Central Harmony, or the palace of the concubines? I wonder. The farmer just keeps his head down, carefully watching the furrow his plow makes, shouting at the tired ox. Perhaps he wants to plow a few more furrows before evening, then go home. He knows his wife and children have prepared a fragrant and hot dinner, waiting for his return.

I think he probably never thought about how his plowshare is turning over history there. Those neat rows of earth are like pages of history being turned! He occasionally bends down to pick up some broken bricks and tiles, struggling to throw them to the side of the road. I pick up one and wipe off the dirt, revealing a golden tile with a dragon pattern. Although it is broken, the dragon design is vivid and beautiful. It must be the work of craftsmen from 600 years ago. At that time, soldiers, craftsmen, immigrants from the south, criminals from the north, and laborers from various counties and districts—there were “hundreds of thousands” of them—burning bricks, carving stones, sculpting wood, painting beams, building walls, and constructing the city for Zhu Yuanzhang to build his “eternal foundation” for his imperial dream! The scene reminds one of the ancient Egyptians building the pyramids. You can almost hear the whipping sounds of the overseers and the malicious curses…

“Tigers crouch and dragons coil in the sacred ancestral land, golden city and jade walls move with autumn fragrance.” The court poets did not miss the opportunity to offer flattering words. However, near those magnificent buildings, piles of corpses of laborers lay; the Fengyang flower drums beat, dripping with the blood and tears of refugees. A nightmare lasted for centuries on this land!

I gaze at the farmer plowing the field for a long time. I do not know if he sings the flower drum songs, or if he has a history of fleeing from famine, or if his family has anyone who died of starvation. He just concentrates on plowing, as if all his hopes lie in this soil.

I gently stroke the dragon tile in my hand, as if seeing that poor monk again. When the land made him despair, he left the land to seek a new fate; finally, he became an emperor and built countless palaces on this land. But he forgot that it was the blood of these poor farmers that solidified the buildings, making more people despair of the land!

Demolish and rebuild! History is sometimes like a game. Those luxurious buildings, like mirages, quietly disappear. They are burned in the righteous flames of the rebels; they collapse in the merciless wind and rain; then, they are buried under the sharp plowshare! What remains is the land that grows wild grass and grains, like a fresh sheet of paper for life, spread out before the farmers. The giant bricks from the palaces and city walls are now mottled, built into houses, or into pigsties and latrines. Poverty mocks the ancient civilization; civilization is fragmented into the broken dragon tile in my hand and these disjointed thoughts.

The twilight deepens. The farmer who was plowing has returned home without my notice. I walk aimlessly, casually picking a withered yellow stalk of grass from the roadside and putting it in my mouth. A strange taste, a mix of wild grass and bitterness, slowly flows into my heart with my saliva.

　　犁铧，耕耘着宫阙
    雷抒雁
    我静静地躺在中都古城的断垣上。
    这是秋天，又是黄昏，无力的残阳，在断垣残砖上涂抹着血色。那些波光闪闪的水面，曾是这中都紫禁城的护城河，如今被切成一方一方湖泊，暮色中晃动着蓝的、黄的和红的旗帜。
    这便是那位乞食和尚做了皇帝之后在凤阳这偏僻穷困的土地上兴建的都城么？人们只知道北京的故宫，岂不知北京故宫只是它的一件极其简陋的复制品！
    “那里是东华门，那里是西华门！”我注视着那些坍塌的城门，在心里猜想着。北面那座山该是“万岁山”了，那山的位置差不多就像北京故宫后边的景山。要是当初不迁都北京，那条吊死明朱王朝的绳子也许就会挂在这“万岁山”上。
    午门，正在我的脚下，城楼已荡然无存，荒草里，只有一个个被风雨洗得发白的石础。社坛、太庙、承天门、金水河、洪武门以及圜丘，依次从午门向南排去。这些宏伟的建筑，这些曾经神圣得不许百姓涉足的禁地，如今都已成泥，或者堆着粪土，或者翻着泥浪，青青的、针锋般的麦苗正显示着旺盛的生命力。
    近处，有农夫斥牛的声音。我循声走下城垣，只见一位农夫正扶着耕犁在耕作。那里曾是太和殿，中和殿，还是宫妃们的寝宫？我猜想着。农夫只低着头认真地看着脚下的犁沟，一声声喝斥着疲惫的耕牛。也许他想趁着傍晚，多犁几垄，然后回家。他知道，妻子和子女已备好香喷喷热腾腾的晚餐，正期待他的归去。
    我想，他也许不曾想过他的犁铧是怎样在那里翻动着历史的，那一排排整齐的土浪，便是一页页翻开的史册！他不时地弯腰把一些残砖破瓦捡出来，吃力地扔到路边。我随手拾起一块，擦净泥土，竟是黄灿灿的瓦当。尽管已经残破，但那张牙舞爪的龙纹，却极其生动和优美。算算时间，该是６００多年前工匠们的手艺了。当初，军士、工匠、南方的移民、北方的罪犯、各府县的民夫、役夫……足有“百万之众”，在这一片土地上烧砖、琢石、雕木、画栋、砌墙、筑城，为朱元璋构筑“万世根本”的帝王梦！那景况使人联想到古埃及人修建金字塔。你似乎还能听见督军、工头呼啸的皮鞭声，恶毒的斥骂声……
    “虎踞龙盘圣祖乡，金城玉垒动秋芳。”御用文人们却不失时机地献上阿谀之辞。然而，就在那些华丽建筑的近旁，堆积着苦役们的尸骸；凤阳花鼓梆梆地敲响着，滴着逃荒者的血泪。一场恶梦在这块土地上延续了多少个世纪！
    我久久地望着耕田的农夫。我不知道他是否会唱花鼓，是否也有过逃荒的历史，也不知他的家人有无因饥饿而非正常的死亡者。他只专心耕田，似乎一切希望都在这泥土里。
    我轻轻抚摸着手里那块黄龙瓦当，似又看见那位贫困的和尚，当土地使他绝望之后便离开土地去寻找新的命运；终于当了皇帝，在这片土地上盖起如云的宫阙。可是，他忘了正是这贫苦农民的血凝聚而成的建筑，使更多的人对土地绝望！
    推倒重来！历史有时也像一场游戏。那些豪华的建筑，如同海市蜃楼，又悄然逝去。焚烧在义军愤怒的烽火里；坍塌在无情的风雨里；然后，覆没在锋利的犁铧下！留下的，依然是生长野草、生长五谷的土地，如同重新构思生活的稿纸铺展在农民的面前。那些宫殿和城垛上的巨砖，都斑剥着杂色，被砌进屋舍，或被砌成猪栏和茅厕。贫困恶毒地嘲弄着古老的文明；文明断裂成我手上残缺的黄龙瓦当以及这些不成条理的思绪。
    暮色更深。犁田的农夫不知何时已归家了。我信步走着，随意伸手从路边折一根枯黄的茅草含在嘴里。一种野草的清香苦丝丝的杂成一种奇怪的滋味，随着口水缓缓流进心头。
