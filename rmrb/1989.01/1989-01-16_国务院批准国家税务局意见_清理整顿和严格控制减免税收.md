The State Council Office recently forwarded the National Taxation Bureau's opinion on cleaning up and strictly controlling tax exemptions, requiring all regions to implement it seriously.

The National Taxation Bureau's opinion was proposed based on the State Council's instructions that tax authority should not be decentralized, and that tax exemptions should not be arbitrarily granted. Already granted exemptions should be thoroughly reviewed. This opinion has been approved by the State Council.

The National Taxation Bureau proposed that to strictly control the blind development of certain special consumer goods and long-term products, regardless of the nature and type of enterprises, the production and sales of cigarettes, alcohol, firecrackers, fireworks, clocks, watches, bicycles, sewing machines, electric fans, refrigerators, motorcycles, washing machines, vacuum cleaners, air conditioners, electronic organs, pianos, televisions, tape recorders, stereo players, video recorders, electronic game machines, pull-tab cans and pull-tab beverages, aluminum alloy doors and windows, building decoration materials, electricity meters, saccharin, clay bricks, cosmetics, skincare and haircare products, and incense, shall not be exempted from product tax and value-added tax in any region. For small wool mills, small cotton mills, small silk mills, small refineries, small paint factories, small rolling mills, small cigarette factories, and small alcohol factories, product tax, value-added tax, and income tax shall not be exempted. The above items, if already approved for tax exemption, shall cease to be implemented from January 1, 1989, and taxation shall be resumed. In the future, if it is necessary to add other items that are not exempted from taxes according to the needs of national macro-control, the State Council authorizes the National Taxation Bureau to determine them. For imported long-term domestic products, consumer goods with released market prices, and products restricted by the state, product tax and value-added tax at the import link shall not be exempted. For enterprises producing export products, a complete tax refund shall be implemented upon export, and therefore, product tax and value-added tax at the production link shall not be exempted.

The National Taxation Bureau proposed that comprehensive companies, financial companies, and companies in the circulation sector should be taxed according to law. The product tax, value-added tax, and business tax that these companies should pay shall not be exempted; those already approved for tax exemption should immediately stop implementing it. For companies that have difficulty paying income tax during the initial stage of operation, the tax exemption period for income tax shall not exceed one year; those already approved for income tax exemption exceeding one year should be implemented according to the above regulations.

The state's unified tax exemption policy for township enterprises will continue to be implemented. However, tax exemptions approved by local authorities beyond their authority should be stopped. It is strictly forbidden for enterprises to cheat and continue to enjoy tax exemptions after the tax exemption period by changing the factory name, changing the product name, or changing the trademark. Once discovered, they shall be handled as tax evasion.

The National Taxation Bureau also proposed that all regions and departments must strictly implement the state's unified foreign-related tax policies and shall not exceed their authority to formulate foreign-related tax regulations. Any tax regulations that violate the unified tax law and the regulations promulgated by the State Council shall be invalid, revoked, and publicly corrected. In addition, to vigorously reduce the scale of construction, the macro-control role of the construction tax should be fully played. Self-raised construction investment should be strictly levied with the construction tax. Except for the tax exemptions uniformly stipulated by the tax law, no region or department shall arbitrarily reduce or exempt the construction tax.

The National Taxation Bureau requires all levels of taxation authorities to strengthen the supervision and management of tax exemptions and strictly implement the approval system. In handling tax exemption work, they should act impartially and not seek personal gain. Especially for tax exemption projects with large amounts or wide influence, special investigations should be conducted, collective discussions should be held, and approval should be obtained step by step. It is strictly forbidden for individuals to decide on tax exemptions, and violators will be seriously dealt with.

　　国务院批准国家税务局意见
    清理整顿和严格控制减免税收
    新华社北京１月１５日电  国务院办公厅最近转发了国家税务局关于清理整顿和严格控制减税免税的意见，要求各地认真贯彻执行。
    国家税务局的这个意见是根据国务院关于税权不得分散，不许乱开减免税收口子，已经减免的要认真清理的指示而提出的，已经国务院批准。
    国家税务局提出为了严格控制某些特殊消费品、长线产品的盲目发展，无论什么性质和类型的企业，生产销售的烟、酒、鞭炮、焰火、钟、表、自行车、缝纫机、电风扇、电冰箱、摩托车、洗衣机、吸尘器、空调器、电子琴、钢琴、电视机、录音机、放音机、录像机、电子游戏机、易拉罐及易拉罐饮料、铝合金门窗及建筑装饰材料、电度表、糖精、粘土砖瓦、化妆品、护肤护发品、焚化品，各地一律不得减免产品税、增值税。对小毛纺厂、小棉纺厂、小丝织厂、小炼油厂、小油漆厂、小轧材厂、小烟厂、小酒厂，一律不得减免产品税、增值税、所得税。上述各项，已经批准减免税的，一律从１９８９年１月１日起停止执行，恢复征税。今后，根据国家宏观调控的需要，如需增加不得减税免税的其他项目，国务院授权国家税务局确定。对进口国内长线产品、市场价格已放开的消费品和国家限制进口的产品，不得减免进口环节产品税、增值税。对企业生产的出口产品，在出口时实行彻底退税，因此一律不得减免生产环节的产品税、增值税。
    国家税务局提出对综合性公司、金融性公司和流通领域的公司都要依法征税。这些公司应纳的产品税、增值税和营业税，一律不得减税免税；已经批准减免税的，应立即停止执行。开办初期缴纳所得税确有困难的，减免所得税期限不得超过一年；已批准减免所得税超过一年的，改按上述规定执行。
    国家对乡镇企业统一规定的减免税照顾仍继续执行。但各地越权批准的减免税，应停止执行。严禁企业减免税期满后，采取改换厂名、改换产品名称或商标等手段，骗取继续减税免税。一经发现，一律按偷税论处。
    国家税务局还提出，任何地区、部门都必须严格执行国家统一的涉外税收政策，不得超越权限自定涉外税收规定。凡违背统一税法和国务院颁布的法规自定的税收规定，一律无效，应予撤销，并公开纠正。另外，为了大力压缩基建规模，要充分发挥建筑税的宏观调控作用，对自筹建设投资要严格征收建筑税。除税法统一规定的减免税外，各地区、各部门一律不得擅自减征或免征建筑税。
    国家税务局要求各级税务机关要加强减免税的监督管理，严格审批制度。在办理减免税的工作中，要秉公办事，不得以权谋私。特别对那些金额较大或影响面广的减免税项目，要进行专项调查，集体审议，逐级报批。严禁个人决定减免税，违者严肃处理。
