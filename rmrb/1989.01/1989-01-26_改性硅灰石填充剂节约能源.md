The expert group of the China Science and Technology Consulting Service Center highly praises the invention of retired Beijing teacher Zhang Chunfang – the modified talc filler. This new technology will help the plastics and rubber industries improve quality, save materials and foreign exchange, reduce energy consumption, and significantly lower costs.

If natural talc is simply ground into a fine powder without any processing and then used as a filler in high polymer materials, the compatibility between them is poor, leading to secondary aggregation and failing to achieve high-concentration filling.

Zhang Chunfang's modified talc overcomes the above shortcomings. It comes in two forms: granular and powdery. The granular form is widely used in polypropylene and polyethylene for spinning, film blowing, packaging boxes, packing straps, and injection-molded soft and hard tubes. If 20 to 40 parts are added per 100 parts of the original material, China's annual production of 20 million tons of products can save 8 million yuan. The powdery form can be used as a filler for polyvinyl chloride products. After filling, the products' wear resistance and acid resistance are improved several times over.

The production process of modified talc is easy to master, with simple equipment, suitable for on-site production and processing of any scale.

　　改性硅灰石填充剂节约能源
    本报讯  记者艾笑报道：中国科技咨询服务中心专利技术开发专家组非常推崇北京退休教师张春芳的发明——改性硅灰石填充剂。这项新技术将使塑料和橡胶行业提高质量，节约原料及外汇、减少能源消耗、大幅度降低成本。
    如果只将天然硅灰石磨细而不加任何处理，就充作填料添进高分子材料中去，由于它们彼此间的亲合性很差，易产生二次凝聚不能达到高浓度填充的目的。
    张春芳研究的改性硅灰石克服了上述弊病。它分粒状和粉状两种。粒状广泛用于聚丙烯和聚乙烯的拉丝、吹膜、包装箱、打包带及注塑软硬管中。如按每百份原料中添加２０至４０份计，我国年产２０００万吨产品，就可节约８００万元人民币。粉状的可做聚氯乙烯制品的填充剂。填充后制的产品，耐磨和耐酸性能都提高好几倍。
    改性硅灰石生产工艺易于掌握，设备简单，适合任何规模的就地生产加工。
