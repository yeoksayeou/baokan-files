The first phase of the underwater project for China's first self-designed and constructed Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant has been successfully completed. Nuclear industry experts, after inspecting the project, expressed satisfaction with its quality.

The underwater project for the Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant, constructed by a certain unit of the Navy, is the key component of the plant's circulating cooling system. The project is divided into two phases, with the first phase being the intake structure. Located in Hangzhou Bay, the area has large tidal differences and rapid currents, making the construction challenging and requiring high-quality standards. Since early 1986, the East China Sea Fleet of the Navy has dispatched over 500 personnel to participate in the construction. Divers worked in the swift currents, drillers braved the waves to conduct underwater drilling, and construction ships worked with the tides to clear debris. Nearly 200 underwater drill holes were made, and 17,000 cubic meters of debris were cleared. They also employed new technologies such as the "submerged hole drilling method" and "pre-splitting blasting method." They used 10 tons of liquid explosives for underwater blasting, successfully removing over 12,000 cubic meters of rock without causing any damage to the main structure of the nuclear power plant. This created a successful new example in underwater construction.

　　秦山核电站水下一期工程竣工
    新华社上海１月７日电  （记者黄彩虹、通讯员郭新忠）我国第一座自行设计建造的秦山核电站水下第一期工程日前胜利竣工。核工业专家验收后对工程质量表示满意。
    由海军某部承建的秦山核电站水下工程，是核电站循环冷却系统的咽喉。工程分为两期，第一期为取水口工程。这里地处杭州湾，潮差大，水流急，施工难度大，工程质量要求高。从１９８６年初开始，海军东海舰队先后派出５００多名官兵参加施工。潜水员在湍急的海流中作业，钻探兵顶着风浪进行水下钻探，工程船赶着潮水清渣，水下钻孔近２００个，清渣１．７万立方米。他们还采用“潜孔凿岩法”和“预裂爆破法”等新技术，把当量为１０吨的液体炸药用于水下爆破，使水下１．２万多立方米岩石的爆破工程一次成功，核电站主体工程无一处受到震动损害，创造了水下工程建设的一个成功的新范例。
