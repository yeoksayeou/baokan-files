China's shrimp aquaculture has entered the era of full artificial breeding. This marks a shift from the past practice of capturing wild shrimp for breeding, to successfully using artificially bred shrimp to replace wild-caught shrimp for overwintering and breeding. The offspring have also achieved large-scale bountiful harvests.

China's shrimp aquaculture has a history of over thirty years. In the past, all shrimp seedlings for aquaculture were captured from the ocean's natural shrimp population. Due to the inability of wild-caught shrimp to meet the rapid development needs of the shrimp aquaculture industry, some coastal provinces have accelerated research into using artificially bred shrimp for overwintering and breeding. The Zhifu Aquatic Products Development Corporation in Yantai City, Shandong Province, began researching the full process of artificially bred shrimp overwintering and breeding in 1985. By the end of last year, the survival rate of artificially bred shrimp during overwintering reached about 80%, the egg-laying rate was 88.2%, the hatching rate was 76%, and the seedling rate was 62.5%. In 1987, 320 mu (approximately 21.3 hectares) were cultivated, with an average yield of 161.7 kilograms per mu.

　　我国对虾养殖已进入全人工时代
    新华社济南电  （通讯员薛鸿瀛）我国对虾养殖技术开始进入全人工时代，改变过去从海中捕捞亲虾育苗的做法，用人工养殖的对虾代替海捕虾作亲虾越冬育苗已获得成功，其子代养成亦获得大面积丰收。
    我国养殖对虾已有三十多年历史。过去养殖对虾的苗种全部捕自海洋的自然虾苗。由于海捕亲虾不能满足对虾养殖业迅速发展的需要，一些沿海省份加快了用人工养殖虾作亲虾越冬育苗的研究。山东省烟台市芝罘水产开发实业总公司从一九八五年开始，研究养殖对虾越冬育苗及其子代养成的全过程技术，到去年底，人工养殖的亲虾越冬成活率达百分之八十左右，产卵率百分之八十八点二，孵化率百分之七十六，出苗率百分之六十二点五。一九八七年养殖三百二十亩，平均亩产一百六十一点七公斤。
