According to a report by the New York Times on the 19th, Angolan President José Eduardo dos Santos recently changed his stance on refusing a ceasefire, calling for the government to implement a ceasefire with the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) to end the 13-year-long civil war.

UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi proposed a ceasefire in October last year, but it was rejected by Dos Santos.

　　安总统多斯桑托斯呼吁停战
    据《纽约时报》十九日报道，安哥拉总统多斯桑托斯最近改变了他拒绝停战的立场，呼吁政府同争取安哥拉彻底独立全国联盟实行停火，以结束长达十三年之久的国内战争。
    安盟领导人萨文比去年十月曾提出停火建议，但遭到多斯桑托斯的拒绝。
