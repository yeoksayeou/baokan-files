Recently, during the construction of the Jade Buddha Pavilion on Tiantai Mountain in Tiantai County, Zhejiang Province, a Song Dynasty building site was discovered, along with a batch of Song Dynasty artifacts.

The site of the artifacts is located approximately 40 meters to the right of the Jingguan Hall of Guoqing Temple, covering an area of 340 square meters. The artifacts unearthed include inscribed bricks, Song Dynasty vases, ceramic plates, roof tiles, copper bells, celadon, and fragments of celadon with blue glaze. Accompanying these were a large number of Song Dynasty bricks, tiles, and clay water pipes.

The inscription on the top of the inscribed brick reads, "Song Dynasty, Jingde Era, 2nd Year (1005 AD), 8th Month," and the inscription on the bottom reads, "Li's Record." The Song Dynasty vase is 9 centimeters high, with a mouth diameter of 6 centimeters, a chest circumference of 32 centimeters, and a base diameter of 6.2 centimeters. The ceramic plate has a mouth diameter of 9 centimeters. These were common daily utensils during the Song Dynasty. The roof tiles are circular with chrysanthemum patterns, measuring 16 centimeters in diameter. Underground, a drainage system, cobblestone path, charcoal, and house foundations were also discovered. About 30 meters in front of the artifact site, an ancient well was found, with a diameter of 1.4 meters, and its age is yet to be determined.

Tiantai Mountain's Guoqing Temple is the birthplace of the Tendai School of Buddhism in both China and Japan. It was first built during the Sui Dynasty's Kaihuang 18th Year (598 AD) and, along with Lingyan Temple in Qizhou, Qixia Temple in Runzhou, and Yujian Temple in Jingzhou, was known as one of the "Four Great Temples." According to the Southern Song Dynasty's "Jiaxing Red City Records" and the Ming Dynasty's "Tiantai Mountain Records of the Outer World," in the Song Dynasty's Jingde Era, 2nd Year (1005 AD), Emperor Zhenzong of the Song Dynasty allocated "100,000 taels of gold to rebuild Guoqing Temple," bestowing it the name "Guoqing Temple of the Jingde Era." "There were many imperial gifts, totaling nearly 300 volumes of imperial calligraphy from three reigns, which were later destroyed in the war." The reconstruction time recorded in historical documents matches the inscription on the brick. However, when was it destroyed? According to the "Annals of Major Events" in the "Tianzhou Prefecture Records," the largest disturbances in Tianzhou during the Northern Song Dynasty occurred during the rebellion of Lü Shibang, which was influenced by Fang La's rebellion, and temporarily occupied Tiantai. Guoqing Temple was likely destroyed during this war. Therefore, long pieces of charcoal were found underground. According to the Tiantai Cultural Relics Management Committee's appraisal, based on the unearthed artifacts and historical records, this site is likely the remains of a main hall of Guoqing Temple from the Northern Song Dynasty. The discovery of these artifacts provides valuable physical evidence for the study of Fang La's rebellion during the Northern Song Dynasty and the rise and fall of the Tendai School of Buddhism during the Song Dynasty.

　　天台发现宋代国清寺大殿遗址
    出土文物为研究佛教天台宗等提供史料
    本报讯  最近，浙江省天台县在天台山营建玉佛阁时，发现一处宋代建筑遗址，并出土一批宋代文物。
    文物出土地点距国清寺静观堂右侧约４０米处，面积为３４０平方米。出土文物有铭文砖、宋瓶、瓷碟、瓦当、铜铃、青瓷及影青瓷碎片，伴随出土的还有大量的宋代砖瓦、陶水管等。
    铭文砖上侧铭文为“宋景德二年（公元１００５年）八月出”，下侧铭文为“李记”。宋瓶高９厘米，口径６厘米，胸围３２厘米，底径６．２厘米。瓷碟口径为９厘米。这些都是宋代常用的生活器皿。瓦当为圆形，菊花纹饰，径长１６厘米。地下还发现下水道、卵石径、木炭和房屋基础等。距文物出土地点前３０米，还发现了一口古井，井径１．４米，年代待考。
    天台山国清寺是中日佛教天台宗的发祥地，始建于隋开皇十八年（公元５９８年），与齐州灵岩、润州栖霞、荆州玉泉四寺号称“天下四绝”。据南宋《嘉定赤城志》、明《天台山方外志》记载：宋景德二年（公元１００５年），宋真宗拨“中金万两，重建国清寺”，赐额“景德国清之寺”，“前后御赐甚夥（同“伙”），合三朝御书几百卷，后毁于寇”。重修时间，史书记载与砖上铭文正好相符。但毁于何时呢？查《台州府志·大事记》，北宋台州较大的战乱，只有在方腊起义影响下的仙居吕师囊起义，并一度攻占天台。国清寺当毁于此时战火。因而，地下发现长木炭。据天台文管会鉴定，根据出土文物与史籍记载，此地当为北宋国清寺某大殿遗址。这批文物的出土，为研究北宋方腊起义和宋代佛教天台宗的兴衰，提供了珍贵的实物史料。
