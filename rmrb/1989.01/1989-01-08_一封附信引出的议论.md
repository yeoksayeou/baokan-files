Title: Discussion Sparked by an Enclosed Letter

A friend responsible for cultural work in a certain place sent me a drama review, and in the enclosed letter, he specially instructed: a certain leader there watched this play and thought it was good, so he took the time to write this review, hoping it could be published, etc.

Obviously, this friend is trying to use the leader's position and authority to demonstrate the artistic quality and social impact of this play.

If the leader says it's good, does that mean the audience also says it's good? I dare not make such a judgment. But as the saying goes, "Experts see the details, amateurs enjoy the spectacle." Audiences are different, and their appreciation varies. Having different opinions on the same play is common. Even if the audience are all leaders, their opinions cannot be completely consistent. Therefore, a certain leader saying it's good does not mean the audience also thinks it's good; he is just one of the audience members.

When people get sick, they go to a doctor, not to a leader. Even if a leader gets sick, they still need a doctor to treat them. Medicine is a science, and political power, no matter how great, cannot replace it. Drama is art, and it has its own objective laws. Political authority does not equal expertise in art. Attempting to use a leader's words as a standard for judging art is as ridiculous as checking one's health without going to a hospital but asking a leader instead.

Of course, it cannot be denied that some leaders are indeed experts in certain arts, but this is rare. Generally speaking, if a certain leader says a certain play is good, it does not mean the play does not have problems; conversely, if a leader does not see or does not say a play is good after seeing it, it does not mean the play is not good. However, if a leader says a play is good, then it should be reviewed and promoted, but if the leader does not say anything after watching it, should it not be reviewed or promoted? Is this about the artistic height the play has reached, or is it about following the leader's face? Is it about following the leader or being practical?

This is not to say that a play a leader says is good is definitely not good, but why must a drama review always use the leader's golden seal? There are far more than just one or two such incidents. Some even go to greater lengths. For example, publishing a book, no matter whether it has a relationship with the leader or not, one must try every means to get the leader to write a preface. Farmers in remote mountainous areas rarely get to see a play, but some of our performing troupes only think about going to Beijing, eager to invite leaders to watch. And so on, the reasons behind this, I suppose, need not be said.

To change this situation, we must genuinely implement the "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools of Thought" policy. Problems in the art field should be resolved through artistic debate, not administrative intervention. Moreover, we must establish a sense of equality. A leader's personal opinion on a certain literary and artistic work is just one person's view. Including critics, writers, and artists, all should dare to and must put forward different, even opposing views.

### 一封附信引出的议论

　　一封附信引出的议论
    赵培玺
    在某地负责文艺工作的朋友，寄来一篇戏剧评论，并在附信中特意关照：他们那里的某领导看了这出戏，认为不错，故抽空写此评论，望能见报云云。
    显然，这位朋友是想借助于领导的职务和权力来说明这出戏的艺术质量和社会效果的。
    领导说好，观众是不是也说好？不敢妄断。但俗话说“内行看门道，外行看热闹”，观众不同，欣赏有别，对同一出戏有不同的看法是常事。即使观众都是领导，看法也不可能完全一致。因此，某一领导说好，不等于说观众也认为好，他只是观众中的一员。
    人得了病总是去找大夫，没有听说去找领导的，领导得了病也得靠大夫治疗。医学是一门科学，政治权力再大也代替不了它。戏剧是艺术，也有它自己客观的规律，政治权威不等于艺术上的行家。企图以领导的话作为评判艺术的标准，就如检查身体不到医院而请领导一样地可笑。
    当然，不能否认有的领导确是某门艺术的行家，但那是极个别的，一般而言，某领导说某出戏好，未必这出戏就不存在这样那样的问题；相反，领导没有看到或看后没有说好的戏，也未必就不是一出好戏。然而，领导说好才去评论去宣传，领导要是看后什么也没说呢，就不去评论不去宣传了？这是就戏本身达到的艺术高度而论，还是看领导的脸色行事？是唯上还是唯实？
    这并不是说领导说好的戏就一定不好，而是说一篇剧评为什么一定要打领导的金字招牌？类似这样的事远不止一件两件，有的甚至有过之而无不及。比如，出版一本书，不管与领导有没有关系，也要千方百计请其作序。边远山区农民常年看不上一台戏，而我们的一些表演团体却一门心思想着进北京，热衷于邀请领导人观看。如此等等，个中缘由，恐怕也无须多说了。
    要改变这种状况，就要切切实实地贯彻“双百”方针。艺术领域的问题要通过艺术争鸣来解决，不要行政干预。而且，还要树立一种平等的意识。某领导人就某部文艺作品发表个人的看法，只是一家之言。包括评论家在内的作家、艺术家，都可以而且应该敢于提出不同的甚至相反的意见。
