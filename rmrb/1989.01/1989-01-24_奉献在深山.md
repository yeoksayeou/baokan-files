In the early spring of 1980, Wu Yuding, a first-class disabled soldier and first-class hero, returned to Luanchuan County in the deep mountains of Yuxi, Fuqing.

"The people have made you disabled, you are the pride and glory of Luanchuan. The government will take care of your life!" The county leaders said, holding Wu Yuding's hand. Wu Yuding patted his left leg, where a prosthetic limb was installed, and said, "Thank you for the organization's care, but please find me a job!" The county leaders had no choice but to agree to his chosen profession: working at the Sanchuan Station in the "Jiapigou" of Yuxi.

After arriving at Sanchuan Station, Wu Yuding worked more than 10 hours a day. One afternoon, a middle-aged blind man boarded the train and arrived at Sanchuan. Wu Yuding enthusiastically helped him off the train: "Brother, where are you going?" When he learned that the blind man was visiting relatives, he warmly said, "Brother, this mountain road is not easy to walk! I'll take you there after I get off work!" As the sun set, Wu Yuding escorted the blind man up the steep, rocky mountain path. Before they had walked half a mile, his left leg, where the prosthetic limb was attached, began to rub and cause intense pain. He rested for a moment, picked up a thick stick from the ground to use as a cane, and continued on his way. By the time he helped the blind man find his relatives' home, it was already past 9:00 PM.

One day, a young woman got off the train holding a black bag that had been cut with a knife, pointing at three young men about to leave the station and crying, "Stationmaster Wu, those three are thieves." Wu Yuding heard this and shouted, "Stop!" He then leaped forward, grabbing one of the young men with an iron grip. The man, with a fierce look, stabbed him in the chest with a knife, causing blood to gush out. Wu Yuding endured the intense pain, using the martial arts skills he learned in the army to fight the criminals to the death. At the same time, he shouted, "Catch the criminals!" The surrounding crowd rushed over upon hearing the commotion and helped him apprehend the three criminals, handing them over to the police station. Upon interrogation, it was found that these three criminals were a gang of habitual thieves who often committed crimes on trains.

In late 1987, Wu Yuding was elected as the secretary of the party branch of the county passenger station. The traffic bureau built 34 new houses, and the leadership decided to allocate one to him. He voluntarily declined and gave it to an elderly worker who was in urgent need of housing. One year in May, the station had a 30% promotion quota. When the organization's decision list included his name, he declined, saying, "The quota is limited, I'll wait for the next time!" His colleagues knew he fully met the promotion criteria. He was consecutively named an advanced worker by the provincial traffic bureau for five years and a model party member by the city and county for five years. At the award ceremony held by the provincial traffic bureau, he said, "The party and the people have given me enough honor. My lifelong wish is to dedicate everything to the party and society!"

　　奉献在深山
    庆景跃　马新政
    １９８０年初春，一等残疾军人、一等功臣吴玉顶退伍回到豫西伏牛深山栾川县。
    “你是为人民致残的，是咱栾川的光荣和骄傲。你一辈子的生活，政府给包了！”县领导握着吴玉顶的手动情地说。吴玉顶却拍拍自己左腿安装的假肢说：“谢谢组织的关怀，还是给我找份工作吧！”县领导只好同意他选择的职业：去豫西的“夹皮沟”三川车站工作。
    吴玉顶到三川站后，每天工作１０多个小时。一天下午，有位双目失明的中年男子乘车来到了三川。吴玉顶热情地搀扶着他下了车：“大哥，您要上哪儿去？”当他得知这位盲人来此地走亲戚时，亲热地说：“大哥，这山路可不好走呀！等我下班后送您去吧！”夕阳西下，吴玉顶搀扶着盲人踏上陡峭的碎石山路。还没走半里地，他那左腿残部跟假肢接触的部分相摩擦，钻心地疼痛。他稍息片刻，从地上拣来一根粗树枝当拐杖，重又上了路。待他帮盲人找到亲戚的家，已是晚上９点多钟了。
    有一天，一位姑娘下车后举着被刀子划破的黑皮包，指着３名正要出站的小青年哭着说：“吴站长，那３人是小偷。”吴玉顶一听，大喝一声：“你们站住！”同时一跃而上，伸出铁钳般的手死死将一个小青年抓住。那人凶相毕露，照着他前胸就是一刀，顿时血如泉涌。吴玉顶忍着巨痛，拿出在部队学会的擒拿格斗本领，同歹徒殊死搏斗，同时大声呼唤：“抓歹徒啊！”周围的群众闻讯急忙赶来，协助他将３名歹徒扭送到派出所。经审讯，这３名不法分子是常在车上作案的惯偷团伙。
    １９８７年底，吴玉顶当选为县客运站党支部书记后，交通局新建了３４户住房，领导研究决定分给他一套。他主动谢绝，让给了一位住房紧张的老职工。有年５月，站里有３０％的晋级指标。当组织决定的名单上有他吴玉顶时，他谢绝说：“指标有限，我以后再说！”周围的同志都知道他完全够晋级条件。他连续５年被省交通厅评为先进工作者，连续５年被市、县评为模范党员。在省交通厅召开的授奖大会上，他说：“党和人民给我的荣誉够多了。我终身的心愿，就是为党为社会奉献一切！”
