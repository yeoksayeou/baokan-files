A group of experts, scholars, and writers publish youth reading material
	*Life Consultation* Accompanies Young People

	BEIJING, Jan. 18 (Xinhua) -- As a member of the "cultural circle," writer Ke Yan knows well the difficulties of publishing a magazine in today's world of soaring paper prices and a multitude of publications. Nevertheless, she has taken on the arduous task of handling the minutiae of editorial work, such as sending letters, soliciting manuscripts, and coordinating printing and distribution, to lead the publication of a magazine for young people called *Life Consultation*.

	*Life Consultation* is a bimonthly magazine that combines social knowledge and literature. It is sponsored by some well-known figures from China's legal, educational, and literary circles. By looking at the table of contents for the first issue of 1989, under columns such as "Crime and Non-Crime," "Human Emotions Photography," and "Famous People's Letters," one can see that they are attempting to engage in an equal dialogue with the younger generation from various angles, including education, psychology, sociology, criminology, ethics, literary studies, and aesthetics. They aim to analyze real life from both positive and negative perspectives together with the readers.

　　一批专家学者作家办青年读物
    《人生咨询》与年轻人为伴
    本报北京１月１８日讯  身为“文化圈”里人，作家柯岩深知在纸价飞涨、报刊林立的当今办刊物不易。然而，她义无返顾地操持起诸如发函、组稿、联系印刷发行等琐碎的编务工作，领衔为青年人办了一份刊物——《人生咨询》。
    《人生咨询》为社会知识性和文学性的双月刊，由我国司法界、教育界、文学界的一些知名人士主办。人们打开１９８９年第一期目录，透过“罪与非罪”、“人情照相”、“名人书信”等专栏，可以看到他们正力图从教育学、心理学、社会学、犯罪学、伦理学、文艺学、美学的各个角度，与青年一代平等对话，从正反两个方面与读者一起剖析真实的人生。
