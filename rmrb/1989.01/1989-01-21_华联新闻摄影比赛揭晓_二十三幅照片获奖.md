The People's Daily News Photography Competition Award Ceremony was held this afternoon at the newspaper's headquarters. The author of "Severely Punish Human Traffickers," Peng Nian, joyfully received the first prize certificate from the newspaper's editor-in-chief, Tan Wenrui. At the same time, 22 other authors became winners of this photography competition (see the list on the fourth page).

This competition, jointly organized by the newspaper and the Yantai Hong Kong Huilian Limited Company of Shandong Yantai, ran from August 15 to December 31 last year, lasting four and a half months. Over 1,000 entries were received, and nearly 200 photographs were selected for publication. These photographs reflect issues of common concern in real life, capturing the joys, sorrows, and anger of the people. Some of the published photographs have played a role in public supervision, producing good social effects.

The newspaper is committed to improving the quality of news photographs and plans to continue organizing news photography award activities. We welcome submissions from all parties. We hope that more photography professionals, enthusiasts, and readers will provide us with true, expressive, and news-worthy photographs, working together to promote the development of news photography.
