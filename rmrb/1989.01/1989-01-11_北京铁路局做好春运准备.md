    The Beijing Railway Bureau is facing the challenge of high passenger traffic and is intensifying preparations for this year's spring transportation.

    According to surveys and calculations by relevant departments, the Beijing Railway Bureau will handle 22.8 million passengers during the 40-day spring transportation period, an increase of 5.2% compared to last year. The average daily passenger volume will be approximately 570,000, with peak days reaching 640,000. In the days leading up to the Spring Festival, construction workers, service industry employees, businesspeople, and college students in Beijing, who will be returning home via Beijing Station, are expected to number 3.7 million, an increase of 6.7% compared to the same period last year.

    To ensure smooth spring transportation, the bureau has added 31 temporary passenger trains, including 19 inter-bureau direct trains, which can accommodate an additional 40,000 passengers daily.
