The foreign debt crisis is hindering Africa's development. A United Nations official has called for dialogue between Africa and creditor nations.

NAIROBI, Jan. 16 (Xinhua) — The Executive Secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, Adebayo Adedeji, today called for new talks between Africa and creditor nations to resolve the continent's foreign debt crisis.

Adedeji pointed out, "Despite the fact that many African countries have implemented the structural adjustment programs of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, the overall economic situation of this continent remains very disappointing." He said that Africa's debt burden is increasing at a rate faster than the growth of production and foreign trade. By the end of last year, Africa's total foreign debt had reached $230 billion, up from $218 billion in 1987. In just three years, Africa's foreign debt has increased by nearly 32%.

He said that if Africa were to fully repay its debts, more than half of its export earnings would have to be used for debt repayment. This would completely halt Africa's economic development.

Adedeji estimated that if the current rate of debt increase continues, Africa's total debt by the end of this year could reach between $244 billion and $253 billion, an increase of 6% to 10% over last year.

He estimated that Africa's total debt and interest payments due this year could exceed $37 billion, up from $30 billion last year.

He warned that unless a way is found to escape the debt crisis, Africa's economic recovery plans will be further jeopardized. He called for early new talks between Africa and creditor nations to resolve the African debt crisis.

　　外债危机羁绊非洲发展
    联合国官员呼吁非洲与债权国对话
    新华社内罗毕１月１６日电  联合国非洲经济委员会执行秘书阿德德吉今天在记者招待会上呼吁非洲同债权国进行新的对话，解决非洲外债危机。
    阿德德吉指出，“尽管许多非洲国家执行了世界银行和国际货币基金组织的结构调整方案，这个大陆的整个经济形势继续令人非常失望。”他说，非洲的债务负担以超过生产和外贸增长的速度增加。截至去年底，非洲外债总额达２３００亿美元，而１９８７年是２１８０亿美元。３年内，非洲外债增加了将近３２％。
    他说，如果非洲全力偿还债务，出口收入的一半以上将要用于还债。这样将会使非洲的经济发展完全停下来。
    阿德德吉估计，如保持目前的债务增长率，非洲的债务总额１９８９年将比１９８８年增加６％到１０％，今年年底达到２４４０亿美元到２５３０亿美元。
    他估计，非洲今年到期的债务及利息总额可能超过３７０亿美元，去年是３００亿美元。
    他警告说，除非找到一条摆脱债务危机的办法，否则非洲经济恢复计划将进一步受到危害。他呼吁非洲和债权国之间尽早进行新的对话，解决非洲债务危机。
