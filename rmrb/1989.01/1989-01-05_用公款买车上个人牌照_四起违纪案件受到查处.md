The National Committee for Controlling the Purchasing Power of Social Groups recently handled four cases of serious misconduct involving the purchase of cars with public funds and the registration of personal license plates.

The Design Institute of the Ministry of Railways and the 618 Factory of the Northern Industrial Group of China did not obtain approval from the state's purchasing management authorities. Instead, they privately arranged for Chen of the Design Institute of the Ministry of Railways to use public funds to purchase two Santana sedans in the name of a Hong Kong businessman. After acquiring the cars, to evade purchasing controls, they registered the cars under personal names as "gifts from the Hong Kong businessman," thereby seriously violating the state's purchasing policies. This case involved not only the individuals who handled the transactions but also the leaders of the two units, including some at the national bureau-level. By the end of last year, the National Office for Controlling Purchasing Power, in accordance with the regulations of the State Council's "Decision on Strictly Controlling the Purchasing Power of Social Groups," confiscated the two sedans that were fraudulently registered as personal vehicles, and the proceeds from their sale were turned over to the central treasury. The office also fined the units and relevant leaders involved and recommended that the leaders be held accountable. Additionally, similar cases involving the Agricultural Machinery Service Station under the Ministry of Agriculture and the China Agricultural, Pastoral, and Fishery International Cooperation Company were also handled.

　　用公款买车上个人牌照
    四起违纪案件受到查处
    新华社北京１月４日电  全国控制社会集团购买力领导小组最近处理了４起用公款买车上个人牌照严重违纪案件。
    铁道部专业设计院劳动服务公司和中国北方工业（集团）总公司六一八厂不经国家控购管理机关批准，私下通过铁道部专业设计院的陈某用公款以港商名义从国内购买了两辆桑塔纳小轿车，汽车买到以后，为逃避控购，又以港商赠给“个人”的名义，分别上了个人牌照，严重地违反了国家控购政策。此案涉及的人员，不仅有经办人，还有两个单位的领导人，甚至有国家司局级干部。去年年底全国控办根据国务院《关于从严控制社会集团购买力的决定》的规定，对违纪购买以欺骗手段把公车上了个人牌照的两辆小轿车予以没收，变价款上交中央财政金库，对违纪单位和有关的领导人处以罚款并建议追究领导责任。此外，对农业部所属农机化服务站、中国农牧渔业国际合作公司的同类违纪案件也作了处理。
