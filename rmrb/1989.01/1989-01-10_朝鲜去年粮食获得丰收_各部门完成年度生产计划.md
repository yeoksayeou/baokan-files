According to the farm management committee chairman, the cooperative farm's rice yield per cho (approximately 1 hectare) was 8.4 tons, and corn was 8.6 tons, an increase of 2.57 tons and 1.36 tons respectively compared to 1987. The entire province's average rice yield per cho reached 7 tons, and corn was 6.1 tons, a 30% increase compared to 1978.

　　朝鲜去年粮食获得丰收
    各部门完成年度生产计划
    新华社平壤１月５日电  （记者黎能清）去年，在世界性恶劣气候影响下，粮食生产受到影响，朝鲜却传出粮食喜获丰收的消息。
    新年前夕，记者在朝鲜的黄海南道载宁郡三池江合作农场观看了年终分配。据农场管理委员长介绍，该合作农场水稻每町步（一町步约合１公顷）产量８．４吨，玉米８．６吨，分别比１９８７年增产２．５７吨和１．３６吨。整个道的水稻平均每町步达７吨，玉米６．１吨，比１９７８年增产３０％。
    朝鲜去年春夏两季干旱少雨，７月份又连降大雨，对农作物生长非常不利。
    当记者问到粮食为何增产时，黄海南道副委员长介绍说，一靠水、二靠肥、三靠土地加工。
    新华社平壤电　朝鲜去年生产建设取得了较好的成就。
    据朝中社报道，到１９８８年１２月２０日为止，朝鲜国民经济各部门已有４３００多个重要工厂、企业完成了去年度生产计划，林业部、资源开发部、船舶工业部、海运部、陆运总局、电子机械联合公司、绸缎公司，以及平壤、开城等市都完成了去年工业总产值计划。
