Kunming City Establishes a System for Public Attendance at Standing Committee Meetings

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, January 26th - To enhance the transparency of government affairs and expand the public's involvement in politics, Kunming City in Yunnan Province has established a system for public attendance at meetings of the Standing Committee of the People's Congress. This move has significantly improved the openness of government operations and taken a new step in promoting socialist democratic politics.

To facilitate public participation and oversight of the Standing Committee's work and further advance the construction of socialist democratic politics, the Standing Committee of the Kunming City People's Congress began exploring the establishment of a public attendance system at its 19th meeting in August last year. The Standing Committee stipulated that, unless it involves state secrets, different groups and levels of public representatives can be invited to attend the Standing Committee meetings based on the different topics of the meetings. Attendees, except for having no voting rights, can express their opinions and suggestions during group discussions. In October last year, when the Standing Committee held a meeting to hear the municipal government's report on the grain issue, the public representatives attending the meeting sharply criticized the practice of "emphasizing tobacco over grain" in rural work. This drew the attention of the Standing Committee and the municipal government, which promptly corrected the previous guiding ideology of "emphasizing tobacco over grain" and decided to convert some of the best tobacco fields to grain production. They also promptly formulated preferential policies for grain production. After half a year of practice, this experiment has shown clear results, further improving the efficiency of the Standing Committee's work and the transparency of government affairs.

Through the exploration of inviting public representatives to attend Standing Committee meetings, the Standing Committee of the Kunming City People's Congress decided at its 22nd meeting held early this year to establish a system for public attendance at Standing Committee meetings and to continue this system in the long term. The Standing Committee also published the "Trial Measures for Public Attendance at Meetings of the Standing Committee of the Kunming City People's Congress." These measures stipulate that seats at the Standing Committee meetings are designated for representatives from democratic parties, mass organizations, news reporters, etc. All democratic parties, trade unions, women's federations, youth leagues, and other organizations in Kunming City can be invited to send representatives to attend the Standing Committee meetings. Attendees, except for having no voting rights and not being able to speak during the meeting, can take notes and can orally or in writing report their opinions and suggestions to the Office of the Standing Committee of the Kunming City People's Congress after the meeting.

　　便于群众参与和监督　进一步推进民主政治    
    昆明市建立人大常委会旁听制度
    新华社昆明１月２６日电（记者周晓频）云南省昆明市建立人大常委会议旁听制度，有效地提高了政务公开的透明度，为扩大人民群众参政议政迈出了新的一步。
    为了便于人民群众参与和监督人大常委会的工作，进一步推进社会主义民主政治建设，昆明市人大常委会从去年８月举行的第１９次会议开始探索建立群众旁听制度的办法。常委会规定，只要不涉及国家机密，均可根据会议的不同议题，邀请不同方面、不同层次的群众代表列席人大常委会议。列席的代表除无表决权外，可在小组讨论时发表自己的意见和建议。去年１０月市人大常委会开会听取市政府关于粮食问题的汇报时，列席会议的群众代表对农村工作中“重烟轻粮”的作法提出了尖锐的批评，引起了市人大常委会和市政府的重视，市政府立即纠正了过去“重烟轻粮”的指导思想，决定把一部分种烟的好田好地退出来种粮，并及时制定了发展粮食生产的优惠政策。经过半年的实践，这种试验收到了明显的效果，进一步提高了人大常委会的工作效率和政务公开的透明度。
    通过对列席人大常委会议的探索，昆明市人大常委会于今年初召开的第２２次会议决定，在邀请群众代表列席人大常委会基础上，建立人大常委会旁听制度，并将这项制度长期坚持下去。市人大常委会还向全市公布了《昆明市人大常委会会议旁听试行办法》。这个办法规定，人大常委会议席分别设民主党派席、群众团体席、新闻记者席等。凡昆明市的各民主党派、工会、妇联、共青团以及其他组织，均可应邀派代表旁听人大常委会会议。旁听的代表除无表决权和不能当场发言外，可以作记录，可以在会后口头或书面向市人大常委会办公厅反映意见和建议。
