	Zhao Ziyang, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, met with Moussa Traoré, President of the Republic of Mali and Chairman of the Executive Council of the Organization of African Unity, who was visiting China at Zhao's invitation. Zhao pointed out that China has encountered problems in its development mainly because it has been too hasty. Now, the key is to work hard and plan for the long term. He said that China is a developing country, and developing its agriculture and industry is a long-term task. With its large population, China will need more than half a century, or even longer, to achieve modernization.

	In discussing China's economic reform situation, Zhao Ziyang said that China's reform has been underway for 10 years, and there have been significant developments in all areas. However, some difficulties have also arisen, such as price increases and inflation. The main reasons are: first, the pace of development has been too fast and the scale too large; second, the reform is a transition from a centralized planned economy to a market economy, and during this transition from the old to the new system, some aspects have been out of control. He said that the Third Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee, held last year, proposed the task of rectification and readjustment over two years, re-emphasizing the strengthening of agriculture, reducing the scale of construction, strengthening macro-control, establishing a new economic order, consolidating the achievements of 10 years of reform, and creating conditions for further progress. This does not mean that China's reform policy has changed, but rather a temporary adjustment. China's direction and policies of reform and opening up have not changed; only the steps have been adjusted. He stressed that this measure will be more conducive to future development.

	In discussing the debt issue, Zhao Ziyang emphasized that to solve the debt problem, it must be placed on the basis of the development of developing countries and cannot be solved by sacrificing the interests of developing countries. He expressed that China has no objection to President Traoré's suggestion to convene an international conference on the African debt issue.

	General Secretary Zhao Ziyang also expressed his thanks to President Traoré for his efforts in promoting the friendship between China and Mali. He said that China attaches great importance to its friendly relations with Mali and African countries. He also praised President Traoré's contributions in the field of "management cooperation" and expressed China's willingness to cooperate with Mali in various forms and fields, hoping to achieve new progress in this regard.

	President Traoré said that he has been following China's recent development with sympathy and admiration and believes that through reform, China will join the ranks of modernized countries. He said that more and more African countries now realize that developing countries must take the path of reform.

	Foreign Minister Qian Qichen was present at the meeting.

　　赵紫阳会见特拉奥雷时说    
    中国发展要靠努力奋斗长期打算   
    前进中多次出现问题主要是因为操之过急
    本报北京１月２６日讯  记者孙毅报道：中共中央总书记赵紫阳今天下午在中南海会见应邀来访的马里共和国总统、非洲统一组织执行主席穆萨·特拉奥雷时指出，中国在发展中多次出现问题，主要是因为操之过急，现在看来，第一要努力奋斗，第二要作长期打算。他说，中国是发展中的国家，发展工农业是长期的任务，中国人口多，实现现代化还要半个多世纪或更长的时期。
    在介绍中国经济改革形势时，赵紫阳说，中国的改革进行了１０年，各方面都有较大的发展，但是也出现了一些困难，表现在物价上涨、通货膨胀。主要原因一是发展速度过快，规模过大；二是改革是从原来的集中计划经济过渡到商品市场的经济，这样，在新旧体制交替的转变过程中有些失控。他说，去年召开的十三届三中全会，提出了花两年的时间治理整顿的任务，重新强调加强农业，把建设规模缩小，加强宏观调控，建立新的经济秩序，把１０年改革的成绩巩固下来，并创造继续前进的条件，这不意味着中国的改革方针有何变化，而是短暂的调整，中国改革开放的方向、政策没有变，只是步骤做了调整。他强调，这一措施将会更有利于今后的发展。
    在谈到债务问题时，赵紫阳强调，要解决债务问题，就要把它放在发展中国家的发展的基础上来解决，而不能靠牺牲发展中国家的利益。他表示，对马里总统建议召开关于非洲债务问题的国际会议，中国方面没有困难。
    赵紫阳总书记还对特拉奥雷总统为发展中马两国的友谊所做出的努力表示感谢。他说，中国对同马里和非洲国家的友好关系非常珍惜。他还赞扬马里总统在“管理合作”方面所作的贡献，并表示中国愿意同马里通过多种形式、在多种领域进行合作，并希望在这方面取得新的进展。
    特拉奥雷总统表示他以同情和钦佩的心情注意中国近年来发展的成就，并相信中国经过改革将进入现代化国家的行列。他说，目前更多的非洲国家也认识到发展中国家必须走改革的道路。
    外交部长钱其琛会见时在座。
