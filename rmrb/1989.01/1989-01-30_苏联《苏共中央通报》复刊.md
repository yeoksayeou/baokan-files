Date: 1989-01-30
Edition: 6

The "CPSU Central Committee Bulletin," originally founded during Lenin's time as the "Central Committee Bulletin of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)," has recently resumed publication under the name "CPSU Central Committee Bulletin."

General Secretary of the CPSU Gorbachev wrote the preface for the first issue. He pointed out that this publication will help party members and non-party members more broadly participate in the formulation and implementation of party policies, uniting workers, peasants, and intellectuals to achieve the lofty goal of reform.

The first issue is over 250 pages thick. In the "CPSU Central Committee" column, it introduces the work of the Central Committee after the 19th Party Congress, publishes some important resolutions that have not been published before, and includes biographies of members and alternate members of the Politburo and Central Secretaries.

This issue also features documents from the Central Committee's Political Bureau's review of historical injustices, a summary of the development of CPSU organizations, and a compilation of letters from the masses.
