	The 1989 National Earthquake Trend Consultation Meeting believes that earthquakes in mainland China show a clear trend of fluctuating intensification. This state may continue until the end of the century. During this period, there may be multiple earthquakes of magnitude 7 or above in certain regions of western China, and the activity level of moderate to strong earthquakes (magnitude 6 or above) in eastern regions may also increase.

	It is reported that in 1988, China experienced 37 earthquakes of magnitude 5 or above, of which 13 occurred in Taiwan and 24 in mainland regions. The frequency and intensity of moderate to strong earthquakes reached the highest levels in over a decade since 1976. From June 1987 to November 1988, there were no earthquakes of magnitude 6 or above in mainland China. However, after 18 months of relative calm, three strong earthquakes of magnitude 7 or above occurred within 30 hours between November 5 and 6, 1988, in Qinghai's Tanggula Mountains (magnitude 7) and Yunnan's Lancang-Langma region (magnitudes 7.6 and 7.2). The stark contrast between long-term calm and extreme activity within two days is notable. While moderate to strong earthquakes are active in western regions, eastern regions remain relatively quiet. Experts believe this may be related to the increased collision between the Indian Plate and the Eurasian Plate.

	Regarding how to improve earthquake forecasting, Director of the State Seismological Bureau, Fang Zhangshun, said that earthquake forecasting is a scientific challenge, and it is still difficult to fully overcome. Generally speaking, earthquake science is still in its infancy worldwide, and the level of earthquake forecasting is far from satisfactory. He said that under these circumstances, Chinese seismologists must strive for progress, build on existing achievements, and, with a high sense of responsibility to the people, first conduct medium-to-long-term earthquake trend analysis to predict as accurately as possible the regions where strong earthquakes may occur in the future. Based on this overall analysis, key monitoring regions should be identified. In these regions, earthquake prediction and forecasting work should be strengthened to rapidly obtain pre-earthquake information and make forecasts to a certain extent. After an earthquake, the magnitude and epicenter should be quickly determined, and based on the characteristics of the earthquake sequence, the trend of post-earthquake activity should be rapidly assessed.

　　一九八九年度全国地震趋势会商会认为
    我国大陆地震有明显起伏增强趋势
    到本世纪末西部某些地区可能发生多次七级以上强震
    本报北京１月１０日讯  记者王友恭从今天在京开幕的１９８９年度全国地震趋势会商会上获悉：我国大陆地震活动出现明显起伏增强趋势。这种状态可能要持续到本世纪末。在此期间，我国大陆，尤其是西部的某些地区可能发生多次７级以上强震，东部地区中强地震（６级以上为强震）活动水平亦可能有所增强。
    据悉，１９８８年我国共发生５级以上地震３７次，其中台湾１３次，大陆地区２４次。中强以上地震的频度、强度都达１９７６年后１０多年来的最高水平。从１９８７年６月至１９８８年１１月初，我国大陆地区未发生６级以上地震，然而在连续１８个月的平静之后，去年１１月５日至６日，在短短的３０个小时内，连续发生了青海唐古拉山７级和云南澜沧—耿马７．６级、７．２级三次强烈地震。长期的平静和两天之内７级以上强震的极端活跃形成强烈的反差。在西部地区中强以上地震活跃的同时，东部地区却相当平静。专家认为，这可能与印度板块向北推挤、欧亚板块碰撞加剧有关。
    在谈到如何提高地震预报水平时，国家地震局局长方樟顺说，地震预报是科学上的难点，要彻底攻克地震预报难关尚有很大难度。总的说来，当前世界上地震科学尚处童年时期，地震预报的水平难以尽如人意。他说，在这种情况下，我国地震工作者要奋发进取，在已有成绩的基础上更加努力，以对人民高度负责的精神首先做好中长期地震趋势分析，尽可能预测未来强震可能发生的地区。在大形势分析的基础上，确定重点监测地区。在这些地区切实加强地震预测预报工作，尽可能迅速地获得地震前兆信息，做出一定程度的预报。在地震发生后尽快确定震级、震中，并根据地震序列特性，迅速判定地震后地震活动趋势。
