Zhaodong Takes New Steps to Reduce Farmers' Burdens
Three Reforms Save Over 3.7 Million Yuan in Expenditures in One Year

People's Daily reports: Correspondent Wu Peizhen reports: To reduce fiscal expenditures and ease the burden on farmers, Zhaodong City in Heilongjiang Province implemented three reforms in rural areas, saving over 3.7 million yuan in one year, which has been well-received by the farmers.

These three reforms are: reducing the number of full-time village cadres from 7 to 3; changing the practice of reimbursing public entertainment expenses to a fixed annual quota; and fixing the amount for mandatory labor fees in rural areas, with village cadres sharing the cost if there is an overspend.

Zhaodong City has 330 natural villages. A year ago, the village head, party secretary, accountant, cashier, messenger, public security chief, and militia company commander were all full-time positions, each earning 2,000 yuan annually, all funded by the farmers. The city's Party Committee and government decided to reduce the number of full-time positions from 7 to 3, with only the village head, party secretary, and accountant remaining full-time, while the other four positions changed to compensation for lost work time. This reform alone saved the rural areas over 2 million yuan in expenses.

A year ago, it was common for rural cadres in Zhaodong to indulge in free meals and entertainment. Whenever they had guests, almost all the village cadres would join, much to the farmers' discontent. Over the past year, the city has changed the annual entertainment budget from 4,000 yuan per village to 1,700 yuan (2,000 yuan for large villages and 1,500 yuan for small villages), allocating the funds to individual cadres who take turns hosting guests at their homes. Any overspending is not reimbursed, and any savings belong to the cadre.

At the same time, reforms were made to the mandatory labor system in rural areas. In the past, when villages needed labor for public works, cadres often assigned "favor labor" and "favor vehicles" (favoring those with good relationships) with higher wages, and cadres would receive kickbacks. Since these wages were all borne by the farmers through mandatory contributions, it increased the burden on the farmers, resulting in each rural labor force having to contribute 10 yuan annually for mandatory labor fees. Now, the total amount of labor and wages for the entire village's public works is calculated and fixed at the beginning of the year, with no changes allowed throughout the year. If the expenditure increases, additional contributions from farmers are not allowed.

The implementation of these three reforms saved over 3.7 million yuan for the farmers and also reduced local fiscal expenditures, helping to prevent widespread corruption among cadres due to wasteful spending. If this practice were to be promoted nationwide in rural areas, it would save tens of billions of yuan.

　　肇东减轻农民负担迈新步
    实行三项改革一年节约开支三百七十多万元
    本报讯  记者武培真报道：为压缩财政开支、减轻农民负担，黑龙江省肇东市在农村实施三项改革，一年节约开支３７０多万元，深受农民欢迎。
    这三项改革是：每村将７名脱产干部减为３名；变公共招待饭实报实销为全年定额包干；将农村义务用工费包死，如果超支，由村干部分担。
    肇东市共有３３０个自然村。一年前，村长、支书、会计、出纳员、通讯员、治保主任和民兵连长都脱产，人均年薪２０００元，都由农民分摊。市委、市政府决定，将上述７名脱产人员减为３名，除村长、支书和会计脱产外，其余４人改为误工补贴。仅这一项改革全市农村可省经费２００多万元。
    一年前，肇东农村干部混吃混喝成风。每逢陪客，全村干部大多一齐上，农民十分不满。一年来，该市将每村年招待费４０００元改为１７００元（大村２０００元，小村１５００元），将钱包干到人，由脱产村干部在自家轮流招待客饭，超支不补，节约归己。
    与此同时，对农村义务用工制进行改革。过去，村里公共事业用工，村干部往往派人情工、人情车（和谁关系好派谁出工）工钱高定，干部得回扣。由于这些工钱都由农民义务分摊，加重了农民负担，致使全市每个农村劳力每年要交纳义务用工费１０元钱。现在，将全村公共用工量和工钱测算清楚，确定下来，开春包死，全年不得更改。如果花费增多，不许向农民增加摊派。
    上述三项改革的实施，共向农民少摊派３７０多万元，也减少了地方财政开支，并有助于防止广大干部在挥霍浪费中腐化堕落。此种做法，如果在全国农村推广，将节约资金数十亿元。
