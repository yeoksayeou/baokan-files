Fujian has made new progress in its spiritual civilization construction by focusing on vocational ethics and social public ethics education, and by carrying out the creation of civilized units around economic construction.

Fujian's spiritual civilization construction, with vocational ethics and social public ethics as its core content, has been carried out through various series of activities in various cities and counties. Activities such as "Satisfaction in Sanming," "Warm Rongcheng," "Hundred Families Window Excellent Service Competition," "Being a Civilized Citizen of Zhangzhou," and "Five Excellent Xinghua" have all revolved around improving the investment environment, deepening reforms, and urgently solving problems such as improving work efficiency, creating a good social order and beautiful environment, providing high-quality services, and social stability. These efforts have enhanced the attractiveness of opening up to the outside world and promoted the development of an export-oriented economy.

The efforts to optimize social customs and environment have been carried out through mass self-governing organizations to promote the transformation of customs, conducting self-education. The "Customs Transformation Council," "Youth New Wind Promotion Association," "Elderly Association," and "Women's Anti-Gambling Association" established in urban and rural areas across the province have all promoted self-management and self-discipline in breaking away from feudal superstitions, opposing extravagant waste, and promoting new wedding ceremonies, simple funeral ceremonies, economical housewarming, and not holding religious ceremonies. In southern Fujian, the superstitious custom of "Universal Crossing" has been stopped for two consecutive years, not only avoiding the problems of price surges, drunkenness and fighting, food poisoning, affecting production, and disrupting public order that occurred during the "Universal Crossing" period in the past, but also saving more than 300 million yuan in funds for expanded reproduction.

The promotion of spiritual civilization construction to material civilization construction has made Fujian's cadres more conscious of the need to grasp both civilizations in the new situation of reform and opening up. Some cities and counties have incorporated spiritual civilization construction into the target management system for officials, with deployment, implementation, and assessment. The province, cities, and counties all name and commend a number of civilized cities, counties, towns, and villages each year, thereby promoting spiritual civilization construction throughout the province. To adapt to the new situation of reform and opening up, various places in Fujian have combined urban planning, construction, and management, through local legislation, promulgated regulations and local rules on changing the environment, traffic order, public health, market management, social security, and carried out comprehensive rectification, implementing urban governance by law, making spiritual civilization construction gradually move towards a standardized track.

### 福建精神文明建设有新进展  群众自治组织开展移风易俗

　　福建精神文明建设有新进展
    群众自治组织开展移风易俗
    本报福州１月１５日电  记者张铭清报道：福建省以职业道德和社会公德教育为重点，围绕经济建设开展创建文明单位活动，使全省精神文明建设有了新的进展。
    福建省以职业道德和社会公德建设为中心内容的精神文明建设是通过各地市的各种系列活动展开的。“满意在三明”、“温暖的榕城”、“百家窗口优质服务竞赛”、“做文明的漳州市民”、“五优的兴化”活动，都围绕改善投资环境、深化改革急需解决的提高办事效率、创造优良的社会秩序和优美环境、提供优质服务和社会安定等问题，增强了对外开放的吸引力，推动了外向型经济的发展。
    优化社会风尚和社会环境的努力，是通过群众自治组织开展移风易俗活动，进行自我教育的形式进行的。全省城乡普遍建立的“移风易俗理事会”、“青年新风促进会”、“老人协会”、“妇女禁赌会”在破除封建迷信、反对挥霍浪费等陈规陋习，促进婚事新办、丧事简办、乔迁省办、神事不办方面都促进了自我管理、自我约束。闽南连续两年制止了“普渡”迷信陋习，不仅避免了以往“普渡”期间出现的物价暴涨、酗酒斗殴、食物中毒、影响生产、扰乱治安等社会问题，还节约了３亿多元资金用于扩大再生产。
    精神文明建设对物质文明建设的促进作用，使福建的干部增强了在改革开放新形势下，两个文明一起抓的自觉性。一些市县把精神文明建设纳入干部任职目标管理制，有部署、有落实、有考核。省地县每年都命名表彰一批文明城市、县区镇村，从而带动了全省的精神文明建设。为了适应改革开放的新形势，福建各地把城镇规划、建设和管理结合起来，通过地方立法、颁布了改变环境、交通秩序、公共卫生、市场管理、社会治安等方面的法规条例和乡规民约，进行综合整治，实行以法治城，使精神文明建设逐步走上规范化的轨道。
