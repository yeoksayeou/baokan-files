A Lifetime of Supporting the Military
—In Memory of the Model of Supporting the Military and Caring for Families of Soldiers, Zhang Yinfang

By Luo Tongsong, People's Daily Reporter

During the intense battles of the Huaihai Campaign in 1948, a 19-year-old girl, dressed in a small floral jacket, with long braids, and pushing a wheelbarrow, tirelessly delivered military rations to the People's Liberation Army under the rain of bullets. She joined the Communist Party of China on the front lines. This was Zhang Yinfang, the leader of the Sisterhood Team in Zimei Township, Pizhou County, Jiangsu Province.

Forty years have passed. What has become of Zhang Yinfang? In April 1987, she attended a meeting in Beijing as a national advanced individual worker and was received by leaders such as Zhao Ziyang, Hu Qili, and Tian Jiyun. In April 1988, the Jiangsu Provincial People's Government awarded Zhang Yinfang the title of Labor Model. In July, she attended a meeting in Beijing for the second time as a national advanced individual in supporting the military and caring for families of soldiers and was received by leaders such as Yang Shangkun and Qiao Shi.

Zhang Yinfang began supporting the military at the age of 16. Pizhou County is a revolutionary old base area. Her brother, Zhang Yinhan, was then the district political commissar. She served as her brother's "little courier" and, along with some sisters, made shoes and embroidered socks for the New Fourth Army. A battalion commander from the New Fourth Army wrote the characters "Model of Supporting the Military" for her, which she treasured like a jewel and embroidered on a piece of red cloth, hanging it in the main room. She once said, "I will support the military for a lifetime!"

Zhang Yinfang has faithfully kept her promise to support the military for a lifetime. Even during the difficult times around 1960, when natural disasters and man-made calamities stripped the trees bare in front of and behind the village, she did not forget the families of martyrs and soldiers. She sold all her dowry items, grinding sweet potato sticks into noodles day and night, helping a few nearby families of martyrs and soldiers get through the hard times. Every year when new recruits enlisted, she would bring handmade socks and shoe insoles, along with some gifts, to see them off, instructing the children to "work hard, contribute to the army, and bring glory to the hometown." She was a famous figure in the county. The new recruits all took Zhang Mama's instructions as a vow, carrying it with them to the army.

For several years, newspapers and radio broadcasts reported that the fighting had started in Laoshan. Zhang Yinfang wanted to go to the battlefield, just like she did back then, to do something for the soldiers. Before the Spring Festival of 1986, she told her husband, Chen Baoguang, "This time, I must go to Laoshan. The soldiers are fighting hard there, defending the country. I can't do much, but I can go to the cat-ear cave to spend the New Year with them, right!" Chen Baoguang always went along with her. Thus, she packed 15 pairs of embroidered shoe insoles, each with different patterns, along with locally produced products from Pizhou County, such as tea leaves and phoenix chickens, and 200 pieces of sportswear and other gifts into four packages, preparing to send them by someone else. However, the newspapers reported that too many people were going to Laoshan to offer comfort, and the army had difficulty accommodating them. The county also considered her health and did not approve her trip. She could only write "For the Soldiers on the Laoshan Front in Yunnan" on the packages of comfort items, spending over 70 yuan on postage to send them.

Since 1982, Zhang Yinfang opened a small tobacco and liquor shop, earning a little profit each month. She has never worn leather shoes, never worn a watch, and never worn high-quality fabric clothes. When going to Beijing for meetings and attending banquets in the Great Hall of the People, she always wore a cotton shirt. Chen Juan is her only daughter. When she got married, Zhang Yinfang only made her a set of polyester clothes and did not even buy a pair of socks. In recent years, Zhang Yinfang has spent over 400,000 yuan on supporting the military and caring for families of soldiers.

In Pizhou County and some neighboring areas, families of martyrs and soldiers affectionately call Zhang Yinfang "Old Sister." During the summer harvest and autumn planting season of 1986, when diesel was scarce in the market, Zhang Yinfang immediately thought of the families of martyrs and soldiers. She bought 1,000 kilograms of diesel, divided into 10 iron buckets, and along with some cakes, delivered them to 10 families of martyrs and soldiers in five townships. During the Spring Festival of 1988, Zhang Yinfang gave two old mountain war heroes who returned home each a large clock and a silk quilt cover, and gave eight families of martyrs and soldiers each a standing electric fan. She also bought over 100 calendars, 250 kilograms of sugar, and hundreds of kilograms of cakes, delivering them to many families of martyrs, soldiers, and retired soldiers.

In Yunhe Town, there is an old lady named Zhang whose son died in the Huaihai Campaign, leaving the old lady alone. Zhang Yinfang became the old lady's daughter, for a full 40 years! She has always been fulfilling her duty.

Since August 1988, the Ministry of Civil Affairs, the General Political Department, the Propaganda Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the Provincial Civil Affairs Bureau have successively commended Zhang Yinfang. After her photo was published in the People's Daily, Fujita Ichiro, the chairman of the China-Japan Friendship Cultural Association, wrote a warm and enthusiastic letter to Zhang Yinfang, expressing his admiration for her.

　　拥军一辈子
    ——记拥军优属模范庄印芳
    本报记者  罗同松
    在１９４８年淮海战役的枪林弹雨中，有位１９岁的姑娘，身穿小花袄，拖着长辫子，手推独轮车，不分昼夜，汗水涔涔，给人民解放军送军粮，在火线上加入了中国共产党。这就是江苏省邳县占城乡姊妹团团长庄印芳。
    ４０年过去了，庄印芳该是怎样了呢？１９８７年４月，她作为全国先进个体劳动者上北京开会，受到赵紫阳、胡启立、田纪云等领导人的接见；１９８８年４月，江苏省人民政府授予庄印芳劳动模范称号。７月，她作为全国拥军优属先进个人，第２次进京开会，受到杨尚昆、乔石等领导人的接见。
    庄印芳拥军是从１６岁开始的。邳县是革命老区，她哥哥庄印汉当时是区政委。她给哥哥当“小交通”，还邀合一些姐妹给新四军做鞋子，绣花袜底儿。新四军一位营长给她写了“拥军模范”４个字，她视如珍宝，将字绣在一方红布上，挂在正屋里。她曾说：“我要拥军一辈子！”
    “拥军一辈子”的誓言，庄印芳忠实地履行了。即使是在１９６０年左右那种天灾人祸造成的苦日子里，村前屋后的树皮被扒光了，她也没有忘记烈、军属。她把陪嫁的衣物变卖光，白天黑夜地推磨磨地瓜干做粉条，帮助附近几户烈、军属度过了难关。每年新兵入伍，她总得带上亲手纳的袜底、鞋垫，再买上些慰问品去送行，嘱咐孩子们“好好干，为部队多出力，为家乡多争光”。她是县里的名人。新兵们都把庄妈妈的嘱托作为誓言，带往部队。
    头几年，报纸上、广播里都说老山那边打起来了。庄印芳想跟当年那样，到战场上去给战士们做点什么。１９８６年春节前夕，她对老伴陈宝光说：“这回俺一定要到老山去看看。战士们在那里拚死拚活，保卫着国家，俺别的不能做，到猫耳洞里陪他们过个年，总是可以的吧！”陈宝光遇事顺着她。于是，她把熬了百多个夜晚绣的花样不同的１５双鞋垫，连同买来的邳县特产苔干、凤鸡以及２００件球衣和其他一些慰问品打成４个包包，准备随人托运。但是，报纸上又说，去老山慰问的人太多，部队难以接待。也是县里照顾她的身体，没有批准她起程。她只好在装慰问品的包裹上写上“云南前线老山战士收”字样，花了７０多元邮资邮走了。
    从１９８２年开始，庄印芳开了爿烟酒杂货铺子，每月多少有点赢利。她一辈子没穿过皮鞋，没戴过手表，没穿过高级料子衣服。上北京开会，进人民大会堂参加国宴，总是一身土布衫。陈侠是她唯一的女儿，出嫁时，她只给女儿做了一身的确良衣服，连袜子也没有买一双。这几年，庄印芳用在拥军优属方面的钱达４万元之多。
    在邳县以及邳县邻近一些地方，烈、军属都亲切地称庄印芳为“老姐”。１９８６年夏收秋播时节，市场上柴油紧缺。庄印芳立刻想到了烈、军属们。于是，她买了１０００公斤柴油，分装成１０铁桶，又买了些糕点，送到５个乡的１０户烈、军属家中。１９８８年春节，庄印芳给两位回乡的老山战斗英雄各送了一个大钟和一块丝织被面，给８户烈、军属各送了一台落地电扇，还买了１００多本挂历、２５０公斤白糖以及数百公斤糕点，送给许多烈属、军属以及退伍军人。
    运河镇有位姓张的老奶奶，儿子在淮海战役中牺牲了，留下老人孤身一人，庄印芳便当了老人的闺女，整整４０年！她始终在尽义务。
    １９８８年８月以来，民政部、总政治部、中共江苏省委宣传部、省民政厅先后对庄印芳进行了表彰。她的照片在人民日报刊登后，日中友好文化协会会长福田一郎给庄印芳写来热情洋溢的信，说他对庄印芳“十分钦佩”。
