The contract responsibility system has strong vitality

The contract responsibility system, which separates ownership from management rights under socialist conditions, is a major breakthrough in socialist economic theory and practice.

The Contract System and Price Reform

China's current price system is highly irrational. Many commodity prices are set by the state, failing to accurately reflect the value of goods or the supply-demand relationship. The primary contradiction in China today is between the people's growing material and cultural needs and the backwardness of social production. Under these circumstances, reforming the price system will likely result in price increases for most commodities, except for a few that are oversupplied. High social purchasing power and low commodity supply will inevitably lead to further price increases, resulting in a vicious cycle of price and wage increases.

The majority of state fiscal revenue comes from industrial enterprises. Activating enterprises is the material foundation for price system reform.

How do we activate enterprises? We have conducted many experiments. Practice has shown that implementing the contract responsibility system (hereinafter referred to as the contract system) for enterprises has strong vitality.

The contract system is a good form of separating ownership from management rights under the socialist system. For many years, state-owned enterprises have been directly managed by the state, with their tasks being to complete state-assigned plans. They lack autonomy and initiative, which is the fundamental reason why the potential of state-owned enterprises has not been fully realized. Implementing the contract system means that the ownership of enterprises belongs to the state, while the management rights belong to the enterprises. As long as enterprises complete the responsibilities specified in the contract, they have the right to operate autonomously and become relatively independent socialist commodity producers.

The amount enterprises remit to the state is fixed and must be completed. If not completed, the enterprise must use its own funds to make up the difference. If completed, the surplus is retained by the enterprise for development, collective welfare, and employee bonuses. This mechanism of combining responsibility, rights, and interests can fully mobilize the enthusiasm of enterprise managers and producers.

"Will fixing the base number reduce state revenue?" We believe that as long as the base number is reasonable and the growth rate is appropriate, the state can only gain more, not less. After contracting, enterprises will strive to produce and operate more to retain more. Producers and operators with enthusiasm can achieve the unity of state interests, enterprise interests, and personal interests of employees.

"Fixing the base number also fixes the price!" We believe that it is impossible for prices to remain completely unchanged. However, in a situation where social supply is far less than social demand, there is more money and fewer goods, leading to severe inflation, it is also impossible to make large-scale price adjustments. If prices are adjusted significantly, it will exacerbate inflation. Price reform can only proceed steadily with the improvement of enterprise benefits and the increase of social effective supply, and cannot be rushed. In the future, the price increase should be controlled within 10%, and most enterprises can bear it. The contract system can create the necessary material conditions for price reform and will not affect the steady and active progress of price reform. To avoid frequent changes in contract terms, the base number should consider the factor of price increases when determined.

"Without rationalizing price relationships, enterprises cannot compete on an equal footing, and there will be disparities in hardship and joy." Before price relationships are fully rationalized, the issue of disparities in hardship and joy can be adjusted through the base number. Enterprises with high profit rates have high base numbers. Enterprises with low profit rates have low base numbers. Policy-loss-making enterprises can contract loss indicators, and reducing losses is equivalent to increasing profits, which are retained by the enterprise. Through reasonable adjustment of the base number, different enterprises in different industries can roughly start competing on an equal footing. Base number adjustment is a relatively reasonable and feasible economic adjustment measure under current conditions. This is also an advantage of the contract system.

The Contract System and Shareholding System

In recent times, more and more people in the theoretical circles advocate for the implementation of the shareholding system, and some even believe that the way out for China is to implement private ownership.

We believe that the shareholding system is not something that cannot be done. However, the shareholding system can only be experimented with at present, and the contract system is the one that can be widely promoted.

Some advocate replacing the contract system with the shareholding system. One of the reasons is that they believe the contract system has not solved the problem of unclear property rights in state-owned enterprises. We believe that the property rights of state-owned enterprises are clear: they are owned by the people of the whole country and managed by the government on behalf of the people. Some say, "Everyone owns it, but no one owns it, and property rights are not personalized." How to personalize it? Give the property rights to the employees of the enterprise? But the assets of state-owned enterprises are not entirely created by the employees of this enterprise; they are accumulated by the people of the whole country, including the broad masses of farmers. In the more than 30 years since the founding of the country, the main wealth of the people of the whole country, which has been saved through thrift, is the fixed assets of state-owned enterprises with a book value of 100 billion yuan and a current value of 700 billion yuan. These assets are also the main material foundation of our socialist system. Without this foundation, the socialist system with public ownership as the mainstay would no longer exist. At present, the proportion of private economy in the national economy is indeed too small and should have a greater development. Although we encourage and support the development of the private economy, it is a fact that private investment cannot exceed the fixed assets of state-owned enterprises. Selling part of the existing state-owned enterprise assets in the form of shares to individuals is possible, but it is not possible to sell them all. Who has so much money to buy such a large amount of assets?

The ownership of means of production is important as it determines the nature of production relations and the social system. However, in terms of the enterprise's operating mechanism, the right to use the means of production, that is, the power to control and use the means of production and their results, is more important. The drawbacks of the old system lie more in the unclear management rights, where someone demands money from the enterprise, but no one is responsible for the enterprise. Implementing the contract system, the main content of the enterprise's contract is "two contracts and one link," that is, contracting the remitted profit, contracting the increase of fixed assets, and linking the total wage with the enterprise's economic benefits. "Two contracts" ensure the unity of the enterprise's responsibility, rights, and interests, making the enterprise not irresponsible but someone responsible.

"Short-term behavior appears after contracting." We believe that short-term behavior is not caused by the contract system but by the imperfection of the contract system. If "two contracts and one link" are truly implemented, such short-term behavior can be avoided. For the retained funds of the contracted enterprises, it is generally stipulated that the proportion used for production development, collective welfare, and wages and bonuses is 6:2:2, and bonuses exceeding the state's stipulated amount still need to be taxed. If this is truly done, short-term behavior will not occur. Short-term behavior is also related to the short contract period. If the contract period is appropriately extended, short-term behavior can also be solved. To avoid short-term behavior, a factory director's term target responsibility system, a system of impeachment and dismissal within the term, and a term-end audit system should also be established. It should be noted that the remitted profit of the contract is a fixed number, which is equivalent to the profit created by the enterprise using its own funds for expanded reproduction, retained by the enterprise. The enterprise uses its own money to develop production, and the benefits return to the enterprise, naturally seeking the best benefits, thus enhancing self-discipline. The example of Shougang, which has added 2.6 billion yuan in fixed assets in the past ten years using its own funds, is a good example.

"The contractor is responsible for profits but not for losses." This is also mainly due to the imperfection of the enterprise's operating mechanism. If the enterprise fails to complete the contracted profit remittance task, it must make up the difference with its own funds. After implementing the contract system, most enterprises can complete the base number, and the enterprise's own funds can increase year by year. Once a certain year fails to complete the contract task, it has the ability to compensate with enterprise funds. The contract can also stipulate that if the contract task is not completed, the contracting party has the right to replace the contractor. If a loss-making enterprise cannot turn losses into profits within a limited period, the enterprise should go bankrupt, and the main contractor should be held accountable.

"The contract system is not conducive to adjusting the industrial structure." This can also be solved. First, it can be adjusted through the base number. According to industrial policies, for industries, sectors, and enterprises that need to be developed, the base number can be appropriately lowered. For enterprises that need to be restricted, the base number can be appropriately increased. For enterprises with operational losses, they should be required to turn losses into profits within a limited period; otherwise, they should be declared bankrupt or taken over by other enterprises.

Enterprises contracting enterprises and contracted enterprises merging enterprises are new things that have emerged in the development of the contract system. This is conducive to the optimal allocation of resources, fully tapping the potential of various types of enterprises, and will not cause social unrest due to enterprise adjustments.

The shareholding system is a trend in the development of socialized large-scale production, but not all enterprises can implement the shareholding system, and not all problems can be naturally solved by implementing the shareholding system. Moreover, China has its own characteristics, and even if the shareholding system is implemented, it cannot be completely copied from capitalist countries.

Implementing the shareholding system requires even more separation of ownership from management rights. The shareholding system and the contract system are not mutually exclusive but can coexist.

The Contract System and Separation of Government and Enterprise

The contract system, in terms of economic system reform, is the separation of two rights. But for state-owned enterprises, the separation of two rights means the separation of government and enterprise. This also belongs to political system reform.

For a long time, state-owned enterprises have been state-owned and state-operated, with no separation of government and enterprise. Enterprises are merely appendages of the government and not autonomous economic entities. Implementing the contract system means that the two parties in the contract are equal in economic responsibility and legal responsibility. Both parties in the contract must fulfill the obligations and responsibilities specified in the contract. Once the contract is signed and notarized by the judicial department, the contract has legal effect, and both parties must execute it.

The current problem is that the government interferes too much with enterprises. The contract only has requirements for the contracting party and no restrictions on the contracting party, which is actually unequal. After the contract is signed, relevant government departments interfere excessively, infringing on the enterprise's right to autonomous operation. In some places, the enterprise's supervisory department contracts with the government, and the supervisory department then contracts with the enterprise, which further tightly binds the interests and relationships between government and enterprise, making the enterprise even more controlled. Some contract contents are too numerous, including output value, products, output, cost, etc., with little difference from the past state plans. Some implement profit-sharing, which is not a fixed contract. These do not conform to the principles of the contract system and need to be improved.

Our government has a dual identity as the owner of state-owned enterprises and the manager of society. The government's rights and responsibilities as the owner of state-owned enterprises have been determined by the contract. But the government, as a political power organ, also intervenes in enterprises and must exercise its powers in accordance with the law. In general, the government's macro-management functions should be strengthened, and micro-management functions should be weakened. It is possible to gradually abolish the government departments that manage enterprises and replace them with industry associations to provide information and services to enterprises. Even if the shareholding system is implemented, if the government and enterprise are not separated, the government, as the largest shareholder of state-owned enterprises, will not be able to exclude inappropriate interference in enterprises.

"After separating government and enterprise, enterprises will not obey government management." Such a situation should not exist. As a government, the macro-management of enterprises is mainly through economic means, and administrative means are used only when necessary.

The key issue is to improve the quality of cadres. If the quality of cadres is not high, even the best mechanism cannot function well. To make outstanding entrepreneurs stand out, a competitive mechanism should be introduced, and enterprise managers should be selected through bidding and contracting. The personnel department participates in the qualification review of bidders, and then several qualified pre-selected contractors report their factory management plans to the workers' congress or the workers' representative congress, and then the workers' congress or the workers' representative congress elects the most satisfactory contractor as the factory director. This method embodies the principle of democratic centralism and also turns personal contracting by enterprise managers into contracting by the factory director on behalf of all workers. This not only mobilizes the enthusiasm of enterprise managers but also mobilizes the enthusiasm of producers, and it also provides a solid mass foundation for the implementation of the factory director responsibility system, making enterprise managers have the necessary authority.

To fully mobilize the enthusiasm of enterprise managers and producers, it is also necessary to implement layer-by-layer contracting within the enterprise and actively and steadily promote full-employee mortgage contracting. Mortgage money is responsible for both profits and losses and has the nature of shares. With the improvement of enterprise economic benefits and the increase of workers' income, the amount of mortgage money can also be gradually increased. This further mobilizes the enthusiasm of workers. Maximizing the mobilization of the masses' enthusiasm is the fundamental starting point of all reforms.

The contract system has been widely promoted in industrial enterprises across the country for less than two years. Although the current contract system is not perfect and the reform is not matched, the direction is correct. The contract system has brought us great economic and social benefits, and the matching, deepening, perfection, and development of the contract system will definitely bring us greater benefits.

　　承包制有强大的生命力
    中共中央党校副校长  高狄
    在社会主义条件下，采取承包经营责任制的形式，实行所有权同经营权分离，是社会主义经济理论和实践的重大突破。
    　　　　承包制与价格改革
    我国现行的价格体系很不合理，许多商品价格是由国家制定的，既不能正确反映商品的价值，也不能正确反映供求关系。我国现阶段的主要矛盾，是人民日益增长的物质文化需要同落后的社会生产之间的矛盾。在这种情况下改革价格体系，除了少数供过于求的商品可能降价以外，多数商品要涨价。社会购买力高，商品可供量少，必然引起物价的进一步上涨，从而出现物价和工资轮番上涨的恶性循环。
    国家财政收入，主要来源于工业企业。搞活企业，是进行价格体系改革的物质基础。
    如何搞活企业，我们进行了许多试验。实践证明，对企业实行承包经营责任制（简称承包制），有强大的生命力。
    承包制是在社会主义制度下两权分离的一种好形式。多年来，全民所有制企业由国家直接经营，企业的任务就是完成国家下达的计划，没有自主权，也没有积极性。这是全民所有制企业的巨大潜力没有得到发挥的根本原因。实行承包制，企业的所有权是全民即国家的，经营权属于企业。企业只要完成合同规定的责任，有权自主经营，成为相对独立的社会主义商品生产者。
    企业上缴国家这一头是死的，必须完成。如果完不成，企业就要用自有资金弥补。完成了，超额部分留给企业，用于企业发展、集体福利和职工奖金。这种责、权、利结合的机制，就可以充分调动企业经营者和生产者的积极性。
    “基数包死了，会不会减少财政收入？”我们认为，只要基数合理，递增率适当，国家只能多收，不会少收。承包后，企业为了多留，职工为了多得，必然要努力生产经营。生产者和经营者有了积极性，就能够实现国家利益、企业利益和职工个人利益的统一。
    “基数包死了，把价格也包死了！”我们认为价格完全不动是不可能的，但是在社会总供给大大少于社会总需求，货币多，商品少，从而出现严重通货膨胀的情况下，大幅度调整物价也不可能。如果大幅度地调整物价，必然加剧通货膨胀。价格改革只能随着企业效益的提高和社会有效供给的增加，稳步地进行，不能急。今后涨价幅度控制在１０％以下，大部分企业可以承受。承包制可以为价格改革创造必要的物质条件，不会影响积极稳步地进行物价改革。为了避免承包合同多变，在确定承包基数时，应当考虑到物价上涨的因素。
    “不理顺价格关系，企业不能在平等的基础上竞争，苦乐不均。”在价格关系没有完全理顺之前，苦乐不均的问题可以通过承包基数加以调节。利润率高的企业，承包基数高。利润率低的企业，承包基数低。政策性亏损的企业，可以承包亏损指标，减亏等于增盈，归企业留用。通过承包基数的合理调整，就可以让不同行业的不同企业，大体上在一个起点上展开竞争。基数调节，是在目前条件下比较合理、比较切实可行的经济调节手段。这也是承包制的一个优点。
    　　　　承包制与股份制
    近一个时期，理论界主张实行股份制的越来越多，还有人认为中国的出路是实行私有制。
    我们认为，股份制不是不可以搞。但股份制目前只能进行试验，能够普遍推行的，是承包制。
    有的主张用股份制取代承包制。理由之一，是认为承包制没有解决全民所有制企业产权不明确的问题。我们认为，全民所有制企业产权是明确的：为全国人民所有，由国家代表人民委托政府管理。有人说“人人所有，人人没有，产权没有人格化。”如何人格化？把产权分给企业的职工？但全民企业的资产不完全是本企业的职工创造的，是全国人民包括广大农民积累的。建国３０多年来，全国人民省吃俭用积攒的家底子，主要的就是原值一万亿、现值７０００亿全民企业的固定资产。这些资产也是我们社会主义制度的主要的物质基础。没有这个基础，以公有制为主体的社会主义制度也就不复存在。现在私有经济在国民经济中的比重，确实太小了，应当有较大的发展。尽管我们鼓励、支持发展私有制经济，但是私人投资超过全民企业的固定资产，事实上是不可能的。把现有全民企业资产的一部分用股票的形式出售给个人，是可以考虑的，但也不可能全部卖掉，谁人有那么多钱来收买那么大的资产？
    生产资料所有权是重要的，它决定生产关系和社会制度的性质。但作为企业的经营机制来说，生产资料的占有权，即对生产资料及其成果的支配、使用的权力，更重要。旧体制的弊端，与其说主要是所有权不明确，企业所有者对资产及利润不关心，莫如说主要是经营权不明确，有人向企业要钱，无人对企业负责。实行承包制，企业承包的主要内容，是“两包一挂”，即包上缴利润，包固定资产增殖，工资总额与企业经济效益挂钩。“两包”，保证了企业责、权、利的统一，企业不是无人负责，而是有人负责。
    “承包以后出现短期行为。”我们认为，短期行为不是承包制造成的，而是承包制不完善造成的。如果真正实行“两包一挂”，这种短期行为就可以避免。对承包的企业自留资金，一般规定用于生产发展、集体福利、工资奖金的比例为六∶二∶二，奖金超过国家规定的数额还要缴纳奖金税。真正这样做了，就不会出现短期行为。短期行为还与承包期限短有关，如果适当延长承包期限，短期行为也可以解决。为了避免短期行为，还应该建立厂长任期目标责任制、任期内弹劾罢免制和任期终结审计制。应当指出的是，承包的上缴利润是死数，这就等于企业用自有资金扩大再生产创造的利润，留归企业。企业用自己的钱发展生产，得益又归企业，自然会寻求最佳效益，从而增强了自我约束能力。首钢十年来用自筹资金新增加固定资产２６亿元，就是很好的例证。
    “承包者负盈不负亏。”这也主要由于企业经营机制不完善造成的。企业完不成上缴国家利润承包任务，要用自有资金弥补。实行承包制之后，多数企业能够完成承包基数，企业自有资金可以逐年增加。一旦某一年度完不成承包任务，就有能力用企业资金补偿。承包合同还可以规定，完不成承包任务，发包方有权撤换承包人。亏损企业在限定的期间内不能扭亏，企业应该破产，并追究主要承包负责人的责任。
    “承包制不利于产业结构的调整。”这也是可以解决的。首先，可以通过承包基数调整。根据产业政策，对于需要重点发展的产业、行业和企业，承包基数可以适当降低。对于限制发展的企业，可以适当提高承包基数。对于经营性亏损的企业，应该限期扭亏，否则应依法破产，或被别的企业承包或兼并。
    企业承包企业，承包的企业兼并企业，是承包制发展中出现的新事物。这既有利于资源的优化配置，充分发挥现有各类企业的潜力，又不致因企业调整造成社会动荡。
    股份制是社会化大生产发展的一种趋势，但不是所有的企业都实行股份制，也不是实行了股份制所有的问题都能够自然解决。而且中国有中国的特点，就是实行股份制，也不能完全照搬资本主义国家的模式。
    实行股份制，更需要所有权同经营权分离。股份制和承包制不是互相排斥，而是可以并存的。
    　　　　承包制与政企分开
    承包制从经济体制改革来说是两权分离。但对于国营企业，两权分离，就意味着政企分开。这又属于政治体制改革。
    长期以来，全民企业实行国有国营，政企不分。企业只是政府的附属物，不是自主经营的经济实体。实行承包制，承包双方在经济责任上和法律责任上是平等的。承包双方，都要履行承包合同规定的义务和责任。合同一经签订，经司法部门公证，合同就具有法律的效力，双方都必须执行。
    现在的问题，还是政府对企业干涉过多。承包合同只对承包方有要求，对发包方没有限制，实际上是不平等的。合同签定以后，政府的有关部门滥加干涉，侵犯企业的经营自主权。有的地方，企业主管部门向政府承包，主管部门再向企业发包，这就把政、企的利益和关系更加紧密地联结在一起了，对企业管得更死了。有的承包的内容过多，包括产值、产品、产量、成本等等，承包合同与过去的国家计划没有多大差别。还有的实行超收分成，包而不死。这些都不符合承包制的原则，是应该改进的。
    我们的政府，具有全民企业所有者和社会管理者双重身份。政府作为全民企业所有者的权利和责任，承包合同已经确定。但政府作为政权机关对企业进行干预，也必须依法行使。总的是政府宏观管理的职能要加强，微观管理的职能要削弱。可以考虑逐步撤销政府管理企业的工作部门，代之以行业协会，为企业提供信息和服务。即使实行股份制，如果政企不分，政府作为全民企业的最大股东，对企业的不适当干预，也无法排除。
    “政企分开后，企业会不服从政府管理。”这种情况不应该存在。作为政府，对企业的宏观管理，主要是采取经济手段，必要时才用行政手段。
    关键的问题是提高干部的素质。干部素质不高，再好的机制也不能很好的发挥作用。为了使优秀的企业家脱颖而出，应当引入竞争机制，通过招标承包，选聘企业管理者。由人事部门参加对投标人进行资格审查，然后由若干名合乎条件的承包预选人分别向职工大会或职工代表大会报告治厂方案，然后由职工大会或职工代表大会选举最满意的承包人作为厂长。这种办法，体现了民主集中制原则，而且把企业经营者个人承包，变为由厂长代表全体职工承包。这就既调动了企业经营者的积极性，又调动了生产者的积极性，而且使厂长负责制的实行有牢固的群众基础，使企业经营者有应有的权威。
    为了充分调动企业经营者和生产者的积极性，还应当在企业内部实行层层承包的基础上，积极稳步地推行全员抵押承包。抵押金负盈负亏，带有股份的性质。随着企业经济效益的提高和职工收入的增加，还可以逐步增加抵押金的数额。这就更加调动起职工的积极性。最大限度地调动群众的积极性，是一切改革的基本出发点。
    承包制在全国工业企业普遍推行还不到两年。尽管现行的承包制还不完善，改革还不配套，但方向是正确的。承包制已经给我们带来了很大的经济效益和社会效益，承包制的配套、深化、完善和发展，必然会给我们带来更大的效益。
