	Capital figures gathered to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the peaceful liberation of Beiping. Today morning, over a hundred spirited elders convened in the Beijing Hall of the Great Hall of the People. They were part of the surviving members from the "enemy, self, and friend" tripartite forces of the Pingjin Campaign 40 years ago. Among them were comrades who participated in the military struggle and peace talks for the liberation of Beiping, underground party members, as well as subordinates of General Fu Zuoyi and officials from the Nationalist Party's Beiping Municipal Government. They all contributed to the peaceful liberation of Beiping. Since January 31, 1949, when Beiping was peacefully liberated, they have been friends. Today, they gathered to solemnly and enthusiastically commemorate the 40th anniversary of the peaceful liberation of Beiping.

	The speeches of these elders, who had personally participated in the epic of the peaceful liberation of Beiping, either brought moments of reflection or sparked laughter. Former secretary of the CCP Beiping Inner Seventh District Committee, Cui Yuelei, vividly recounted his multiple-day meetings with Fu Zuoyi's daughter, the excellent underground party member Fu Dongju, at Donghuangchenggen to understand General Fu Zuoyi's thoughts before the liberation of Beiping. Some attendees listened intently, while others interjected, saying, "Comrade Nie Rongzhen once told Comrade Liu Ren, 'You have a very clear understanding of Fu Zuoyi's movements.' On the battlefield, such rapid and accurate understanding of the enemy's highest commander's movements and even emotional changes is rare in military history. It was crucial for our army to make correct judgments and deployments."

	Former commander of the 4th Cavalry Division of Fu Zuoyi's forces, Liu Chunfang, former commander of the 92nd Army stationed in Beiping, Huang Xiang, and the former mayor of Beiping on the eve of its liberation, 93-year-old Liu Yaozhang, also spoke passionately, praising General Fu Zuoyi's historical merits and hoping that the Nationalist Party authorities in Taiwan would contribute to the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

	Li Xicong, member of the Political Bureau of the CCP Central Committee and secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee, also spoke at the meeting. He said, "The peaceful liberation of Beiping ensured that the world-renowned cultural capital was preserved intact, and the lives and property of 2 million people were spared from the ravages of war, creating the famous 'Beiping Model,' which provided an example for the later peaceful liberation of Hunan, Sichuan, Yunnan, Xinjiang, and other places. 'Peaceful reunification of the motherland is the common aspiration and common interest of the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. We hope that the authorities in Taiwan can take General Fu Zuoyi as an example, prioritize national and ethnic interests, set aside past grievances, assess the situation, follow the will of the people, further develop cross-strait relations, and contribute to the early realization of the peaceful reunification of the motherland.'"

　　首都各界人士集会
    纪念北平和平解放４０周年
    本报北京１月２８日讯  记者张书政报道：今日上午，北京人民大会堂北京厅里集聚着百余位精神矍铄的老人，他们是４０年前平津战场上“敌、我、友”三方人士中的部分健在者。其中有参加解放北平军事斗争及和平谈判的同志，有地下党的同志，也有傅作义将军的部下和国民党北平市政府的官员，他们都为和平解放北平作出过贡献。自１９４９年１月３１日北平和平解放后，他们已握手言欢。如今，他们聚集一堂，隆重而热烈地纪念北平和平解放４０周年。
    这些用自己的实践参与书写过和平解放北平史诗的老人的发言，或给人带来一片静思，或引出一阵欢笑。当年的中共北平内七区区委书记崔月犁，绘声绘色地讲述着他曾多日在东皇城根与傅作义将军的女儿、优秀地下党员傅冬菊会面，了解北平解放前夕傅作义将军的思想动态的情景。与会者有的听得出神，有的插话说：聂荣臻同志曾对刘仁同志说过：“你们对傅作义的动态了解得可真清楚”。在战场上，像这样迅速、准确地了解敌军最高指挥官的动态乃至情绪变化，在战争史上是罕见的。它对我军作出正确的判断，进行正确的部署，具有重要作用。
    原傅作义部骑兵四师师长刘春方、原驻北平国民党９２军军长黄翔和北平解放前夕的市长、９３岁的老人刘瑶章等，也热情发言，盛赞傅作义将军的历史功绩，期望台湾国民党当局为祖国和平统一作出贡献。
    中共中央政治局委员、北京市委书记李锡铭也在会上发言，他说：“北平的和平解放，使闻名于世的文化古都完整地保存下来，２００万人民的生命财产免遭战火涂炭，创造了著名的‘北平方式’，为后来湖南、四川、云南、新疆等地的和平解放提供了范例。”“和平统一祖国，是海峡两岸人民共同的愿望，是海峡两岸人民共同利益的要求。我们期望台湾的当权者们能以傅作义将军为榜样，以国家民族利益为重，捐弃前嫌，审时度势，顺应民心，进一步发展两岸关系，为早日实现祖国和平统一作出贡献。”
