The recently formed China Women's Volleyball Second Team traveled to Western Europe in December last year to participate in a 20-day European tour. On the 8th, they concluded their final match in Bremen, West Germany. The attention of various sectors in China is focused on these young Chinese women's volleyball newcomers. Can this young team revive the former glory of Chinese women in the world of volleyball? Can they compete with the world's top teams? On the 8th, the reporter interviewed the team's head coach, Hu Jin. He was pleased to ask the reporter to convey to the general readers that the China Women's Volleyball Second Team has great potential.

The average age of the women's volleyball second team is 19 years old, and the average height is 1.82 meters. On December 18th, they had just finished the national volleyball league held in Taishan, Guangdong, and after only three days of training, their physical strength had not yet fully recovered when they arrived in Western Europe. In 20 days, they played 17 matches in Belgium, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and West Germany, facing off against 9 strong volleyball teams and losing only 5 matches. As the reserve force of the national team, with little experience and having been formed recently, achieving this level is commendable. The opponents also took notice of this new team. In the first leg in Belgium, the Chinese second team lost to the Cuban national team with a score of 2:3, finishing second; in the Netherlands, they defeated the European third-place team, Czechoslovakia, with a score of 3:0; in the United Kingdom, they consecutively defeated Peru, Poland, and Czechoslovakia with a score of 3:0, securing the first place.

Hu Jin told the reporter that the main purpose of this expedition was to train the team. From the results, the team's level was fully demonstrated, and there was no abnormal performance in any match. This result was beyond his expectations and also surprised the opponents. The local media and the coaches of Cuba, the Soviet Union, and East Germany all gave high praise to the Chinese second team. The East German coach believed that the Chinese team's level was comparable to theirs, and the Cuban team's coach also praised the performance of the Chinese second team. In this competition, Cuba and East Germany were national teams, and the Soviet Union team was essentially a half national team, with 4 national team members, and the coach was the national team's head coach who went to the Seoul Olympics. Therefore, the Chinese second team's results were achieved in a situation where strong teams were abundant.

Coach Hu said that this expedition emphasized the spirit of "daring to fight," playing with an open mind, showing willpower, and maintaining style. The girls of the Chinese second team have many injuries, but they play seriously and tenaciously. Number 10, a girl from Shanghai named Xu Xin, is only 1.75 meters tall, but in the Netherlands, she won the "All-Around Athlete Award," and in Bremen, she won the "Defense Award." Lai Yawen and He Yunshu also performed excellently.

Coach Hu said that the most significant gain from this visit is the boost in our confidence. Cuba and the Soviet Union are not invincible; the Chinese team has the ability to compete with them. He said that in recent years, the position of the Chinese women's volleyball team has declined, not because the opponents have progressed so quickly, but because we have declined too quickly. As long as we strengthen training and grasp the laws of volleyball, catching up is possible. From a technical perspective, Cuba is strong at the net, the Soviet Union is technically versatile, and the Chinese second team is relatively weak in serving and defense, and the connection also needs to be strengthened.

　　胡进谈中国女排二队欧洲之行
    本报记者  江建国
    刚刚组建不久的中国女排二队，去年１２月赶赴西欧，参加了前后２０天的欧洲巡回赛。８日她们在西德不来梅结束了最后一场比赛。国内各界的目光注视着这些稚气未脱的中国女排新秀们，这支年轻的队伍能不能重振昔日中国姑娘在世界排坛上的雄风？能不能与世界强手一比高低？８日，记者采访了这个队的主教练胡进。他满意地委托记者转告广大读者，中国女排二队很有希望。
    女排二队平均年龄１９岁，平均身高１．８２米。１２月１８日，她们刚刚结束了在广东台山举行的全国排球联赛，仅仅集中了３天，体力还未完全恢复，就来到西欧。２０天里，她们先后在比利时、荷兰、英国和西德进行了１７场比赛，与９支排球强队交手，仅仅输了５场。作为国家队的后备力量，经验甚少，组建不久，打到这个地步难能可贵。对手们也对这支新秀刮目相看。在第一站比利时，中国二队是以２∶３的比分负于古巴国家队，名列第二；在荷兰以３∶０胜欧洲第三名捷克斯洛伐克队；在英国先后以３∶０胜秘鲁、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克队。夺得第１把交椅。
    胡进对记者说，这次出征主要目的是锻炼队伍，从成绩看，水平发挥出来了，没有哪场比赛是失常的。这个结果既出乎他的预料，也令对方吃惊。当地舆论界和古巴、苏联、民主德国队对中国二队评价很高。民主德国教练认为，中国队与他们水平相当，古巴队教练也称赞中国二队的表现。这次比赛，古巴、民主德国都是国家队，苏联队实际上是半支国家队，其中有４个是国家队员，教练就是出征汉城的国家队主教练。因此，中国二队的成绩是在强手如林的情况下取得的。
    胡教练说，这次出征强调“敢”字当头，放开手打，打出意志，打出风格，发扬原中国女排的顽强拚搏精神。中国二队的姑娘们伤病不少，但打得认真、顽强。１０号上海姑娘许新个子只有１．７５米，但在荷兰她获得“全能运动员奖”，在不来梅又获“防守奖”，赖亚文、何云舒表现也很出色。
    胡教练说，这次出访最主要的收获是增强了我们的信心。古巴、苏联不是不可战胜的，中国队有抗衡的能力。他说，这几年中国女排地位下降了，不是因为对方进步有多快，而是自己下降太快。只要加强训练，抓住排球规律，赶上去是有希望的。从技术看，古巴网上强，苏联技术全面，中国二队发球、防守较弱，串连也要加强。
