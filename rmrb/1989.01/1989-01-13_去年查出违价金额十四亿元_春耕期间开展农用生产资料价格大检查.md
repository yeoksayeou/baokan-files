	Last year, significant achievements were made in the nationwide price supervision and inspection work. According to incomplete statistics, over 530,000 cases of price violations were uncovered nationwide, with illegal gains amounting to 14 billion yuan, of which 8.7 billion yuan has been turned over to the treasury.

	The price supervision and inspection work last year began with a nationwide large-scale inspection of agricultural production materials. This was followed by a nationwide price inspection of the petroleum industry. To support the implementation of price reform measures and to curb the price hikes caused by panic buying, market price inspections were also conducted. The comprehensive inspection of taxes, finance, and prices that began in October last year pushed the price supervision and inspection work to a new high. As an important measure to rectify the economic environment and order, a total of over 8 billion yuan in price violations have been uncovered through self-inspection and spot checks so far.

	Through the price supervision and inspection work, a large number of price law violations in the market and circulation sectors were exposed. Among these, the "official profiteering" phenomenon was particularly prominent, with various illegal methods being employed. During the large-scale inspection, various levels of price inspection departments worked closely with other parties to crack down on a large number of major cases, and the upward trend in prices was initially curbed.

	However, there were also some problems in last year's price supervision and inspection work. The most prominent issue was that in some places, laws were not followed or enforced strictly when handling cases. This was evident in the "four more, four less" phenomenon: more cases of confiscating illegal income, fewer cases of imposing fines; more economic penalties, fewer cases of pursuing legal responsibility; more cases of handling units, fewer cases of holding responsible individuals accountable; more cases of handling grassroots enterprises, fewer cases of holding leading agencies and leaders accountable.

	To ensure that the price increase this year is significantly lower than last year, the central task of this year's price supervision and inspection work is to extensively and deeply investigate and deal with illegal behaviors that violate the State Council's "Decision on Strengthening Price Management and Strictly Controlling Price Increases" and other price regulations. The focus will be on inspecting the prices of grain, oil, meat, eggs, vegetables, salt, sugar, cotton yarn, polyester-cotton yarn, cotton fabric, polyester-cotton fabric, coal for civilian use, detergent, soap, toilet paper, matches, and color televisions, which are closely related to the stability of people's lives. To achieve a bumper harvest this year, in accordance with the deployment of the State Council, a nationwide large-scale price inspection of agricultural production materials will be conducted again during the spring plowing season this year.

### 去年查出违价金额十四亿元  春耕期间开展农用生产资料价格大检查

　　去年查出违价金额十四亿元
    春耕期间开展农用生产资料价格大检查
    本报郑州一月十二日电  记者李而亮从正在召开的全国物价监督检查工作会议上获悉：过去的一年，全国物价监督检查工作取得明显成绩。据不完全统计，全国已查出各种违价案件五十三万多起，违价非法所得金额十四亿元，已收交财政八点七亿元。
    去年的物价监督检查工作，从全国性的农用生产资料大检查拉开帷幕。接着又在全国范围内开展了石油行业价格大检查；为配合价格改革措施的出台和制止抢购风中乱涨价，开展了市场物价检查。从去年十月份开始的一九八八年税收、财务、物价大检查，将物价监督检查工作推向了高潮。作为治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序的重要措施，到目前为止，已自查和抽查出违价金额八亿多元。
    通过物价监督检查工作，暴露了我国市场、流通领域中大量的价格违法问题，其中“官倒”现象十分突出，违法手段五花八门。在大检查中，各级物价检查部门与各方密切配合，查处了一大批大案要案，物价上涨的势头得到了初步遏制。
    去年的物价监督检查工作也存在着一些问题。突出的问题是有些地方在查处案件中有法不依、执法不严。具体表现为“四多四少”。即：只没收非法收入多，兼处以罚款少；经济制裁多，追究法律责任少；对单位处理多，对责任人追究责任少；对基层企业单位处理多，对领导机关和领导人追究责任少。
    围绕着确保今年物价上涨幅度明显低于去年的目标，今年物价监督检查工作的中心任务是：广泛、深入地查处违反国务院《关于加强物价管理，严格控制物价上涨的决定》和其它价格法规的违法行为，重点检查同稳定人民群众生活密切相关的粮、油、肉、蛋、菜、食盐、食糖及棉纱、涤棉纱、棉布、涤棉布、民用煤、洗衣粉、肥皂、卫生纸、火柴和彩电等的价格。为夺取今年农业丰收，遵照国务院的部署，在今年春耕期间，再一次在全国范围内开展农用生产资料价格大检查。
