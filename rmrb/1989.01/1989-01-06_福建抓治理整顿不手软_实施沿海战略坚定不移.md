The year 1989 begins with a clear focus in Fujian Province's economic work: resolute efforts in rectification and adjustment, and unwavering implementation of the coastal development strategy.

"Rectification and adjustment are necessary for the implementation of the coastal development strategy, as a good economic environment and order are prerequisites for achieving 'two ends out.' The implementation of the coastal strategy, in turn, is a powerful impetus for rectification and adjustment." This consensus forms the basis for Fujian's clarification of the guiding ideology for this year's economic work.

In the year since the implementation of the coastal development strategy, Fujian has seen a significant increase in the use of foreign capital and the amount of contracts signed. Trade with foreign countries and Taiwan has developed rapidly, and the momentum of foreign exchange-earning agriculture and the "three-in-one" (processing, assembling, and compensation trade) has been strong. While Fujian has tasted the sweetness of implementing the coastal strategy, it has also experienced the bitterness of economic overheating, leading to inflation and price increases. The shortages of funds, raw materials, and transportation have directly affected the implementation of the coastal strategy and are not conducive to social stability.

By mid-December, Fujian had halted or slowed down 687 projects, reducing construction investment by 933 million yuan. Simultaneously, efforts are being made to adjust the economic structure, taking measures in the structure and layout of industries, the structure of export commodities, and enterprise structure. Xiamen proposes to combine rectification and adjustment with legal system construction, market system cultivation, and improvement of the investment environment. The goal is to gradually shift the main sources of raw materials from domestic to foreign, the sources of funds to primarily utilizing foreign capital, and the structure of foreign exchange earnings to diversification.

Domestic funds are tight, increasing the ability to absorb foreign capital and the selectivity of foreign investment. Fujian's coastal areas are shifting foreign investment towards production-oriented, export-oriented, and technologically advanced types. Through the use of foreign capital, regional industrial structure adjustments are promoted, and in terms of form, the establishment of sole proprietorships by foreigners and the participation in, leasing, or purchasing of old enterprises is encouraged. Joint ventures are encouraged to increase the proportion of foreign capital.

Township enterprises are a vital force in Fujian's development of an export-oriented economy. Rectification and adjustment are pushing township enterprises towards "bipolarization." For export-oriented township enterprises, Fujian Province adopts the approach of prioritized support and problem-solving to encourage them to turn towards "two ends out," directly participating in international competition. For those enterprises without market competitiveness, they are forced to close down, be auctioned off, or be merged, pushing township enterprises to closely integrate with the export-oriented economy and develop towards a higher level.

Rectification and adjustment have brought both pressure and opportunities for Fujian's development of foreign exchange-earning agriculture. Coastal areas are increasing agricultural investment and focusing on grain production while placing the starting point of foreign exchange-earning agriculture on the use of advanced agricultural technology, equipment, and scientific management. This gradually frees the construction of export commodity bases from traditional backward production methods, developing towards land-saving planting and grain-saving breeding to resolve the contradiction between foreign exchange-earning agriculture and saving land for grain production. Various regions, based on their own advantages and the demands of the international market, focus on key products in deep processing and value-added efforts.

Some comrades who initially held the view that rectification and adjustment would affect the implementation of the coastal development strategy, or who planned to first focus on two years of rectification before considering the coastal strategy, have, through practice, felt that the two are not contradictory. They have gradually changed their views.

### 福建抓治理整顿不手软　实施沿海战略坚定不移

　　福建抓治理整顿不手软
  　实施沿海战略坚定不移
    本报福州电  记者张铭清报道：新年伊始，福建省安排一年的经济工作的鲜明特点是：抓治理整顿决不手软，实施沿海发展战略坚定不移。
    “治理整顿是实施沿海发展战略的需要，因为良好的经济环境和秩序是实现两头在外的前提。沿海战略的实施对治理整顿又是一个有力的促进。”这个共识是福建明确今年经济工作指导思想的基础。
    实施沿海发展战略一年，福建利用外资合同和金额成倍增长，对外对台贸易发展迅速，创汇农业和“三来一补”势头良好。福建在尝到实施沿海战略甜头的同时，也尝到了经济过热带来的通货膨胀、物价上涨的苦头。资金、原材料和交通运输全面紧张，已经直接影响了沿海战略的实施，不利于社会的安定。
    狠抓治理整顿，到上个月中旬，福建已停缓建了６８７个项目，压缩基建投资９．３３亿元，同时，在调整经济结构上下功夫，在产业的结构和布局、出口商品的结构以及企业结构方面采取措施。厦门提出治理整顿与法制建设、培育市场体系、改善投资环境相结合，逐步实现主要原材料来源从国内转向国外，资金来源转向以利用外资为主，出口创汇结构转向多元化。
    国内资金紧缺，增强了对外资的吸收能力和外资投向的选择性。福建沿海在外资投向上转向以生产型、产品出口型、技术先进型为主，通过利用外资促进地区产业结构调整，在形式上则鼓励外商办独资企业和参股、承包、租赁或购买老企业，合资企业尽量扩大外资的比例。
    乡镇企业是福建发展外向型经济的一支生力军。治理整顿逼着乡镇企业“两极分化”。对出口创汇型乡镇企业，福建省采取优先扶持，排扰解难的办法，鼓励它们转向“两头在外”，直接参与国际竞争。对那些没有市场竞争力的企业，则迫使其自行关闭、拍卖或被兼并，通过治理整顿，把乡镇企业逼上同外向型经济紧密结合，向高层次发展的路子。
    治理整顿给福建发展创汇农业带来了压力也创造了条件，沿海地区在增加农业投入、重视粮食生产的同时，把创汇农业的起点放在利用先进的农业技术成果、设备和科学管理方面，使出口商品基地的建设逐步摆脱传统落后的生产方式，向节地型种植业、节粮型养殖业发展，以解决创汇农业与节约土地发展粮食生产的矛盾。各地根据各自的优势和国际市场的需求，抓拳头产品在深度加工增值上下功夫。
    一些原先持治理整顿会影响沿海发展战略的实施，或准备先抓两年整治再考虑沿海战略的观点的同志，在实践中感到两者并非是矛盾关系，从而逐步转变了看法。
