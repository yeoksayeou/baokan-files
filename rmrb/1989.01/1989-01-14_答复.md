Reply to the Personnel Department of the People's Daily:

Your department sent a proof of the reader's letter titled "Spending Extravagantly on Factory Anniversary Celebrations, Emphasizing Pomp and Wasting Resources." We have received it. The issues raised by the readers have been taken seriously by the Jin Hua City Discipline Inspection Commission, Supervision Bureau, Lan Xi City Committee, and City Discipline Inspection Commission, and have been investigated and handled. We are now forwarding the report from the Lan Xi City Committee to the Provincial Committee Office.

Middle Office of the CPC Zhejiang Provincial Committee
Office of the CPC Zhejiang Provincial Committee:

Upon investigation, it was found that there were indeed instances of extravagance and wasteful spending during the anniversary celebrations of the Lan Jiang Smelting Plant. The main issues are as follows:

1. To host receptions, 71,100 yuan of public funds were spent. During the anniversary celebrations, the plant invited major suppliers of raw materials, leaders from the railway, transportation, and power supply departments, as well as Hong Kong businessmen with business relations and former leaders of the plant, totaling 98 people. In addition to these, there were also people from outside the area who came on their own. The total expenses for food, accommodation, and transportation amounted to 55,800 yuan. Furthermore, the plant invited the provincial "Little Plum Blossom" Yue Opera Troupe to perform, spending 15,300 yuan.

2. Excessive distribution of goods. During the anniversary celebrations, the plant used welfare and reward funds to distribute one electric fan, one pressure cooker, and 40 yuan worth of plant vouchers to each employee, totaling 120 yuan per person and 289,600 yuan in total.

The plant had also decided to give each employee a tea table and had already purchased the glass, valued at 205,400 yuan. However, due to the undetermined design and the consideration of the significant impact, it was not manufactured or distributed.

3. From July to September, the plant also distributed the accumulated bonus for employees from 1985 to 1987, totaling 148,400 yuan. Additionally, it distributed the overproduction and profit bonus for the first half of 1988, as well as some miscellaneous items and this year's newspaper and magazine fees, totaling 343,000 yuan, with an average of 200 yuan per person. The total amount distributed was 491,400 yuan.

The City Committee held a standing committee meeting on November 4, where several preliminary handling opinions were discussed:

The 71,100 yuan of public funds spent on food, accommodation, and entertainment during the anniversary celebrations is extremely wrong. The Lan Jiang Smelting Plant is ordered to conduct a thorough self-examination.

Using the anniversary as an excuse to distribute goods excessively is also very wrong. These goods should be returned in full or deducted from the employees' wages and bonuses. Goods that have not been distributed should not be distributed.

The accumulated bonus, overproduction bonus, newspaper and magazine fees, and miscellaneous items distributed to all employees in the plant, although they are normal expenses, it is inappropriate to distribute them concentratedly before and after the anniversary. Lessons should be learned from this experience. The accumulated bonus should be included in the total wage and the bonus tax should be collected at the end of the year as per regulations.

Given the facts of extravagance and wasteful spending and the excessive distribution of goods during the anniversary celebrations of the Lan Jiang Smelting Plant, as well as their impact, the City Discipline Inspection Commission and the City Supervision Bureau have initiated an investigation. Necessary disciplinary or administrative actions will be taken against the main responsible persons in the plant. Their mistakes and handling opinions will be communicated to the entire city as a warning.

Currently, the plant director, Jin Lu Xing, and the party secretary, Han Wen Rong, have made self-examinations to the City Committee, City Discipline Inspection Commission, and all employees of the plant. The distributed goods and vouchers have been deducted from the employees' wages starting from November 1988. The plant has also formulated regulations and rules for the management of special-controlled commodities, business expenses, cash, prices, and dining to learn from the lessons, strengthen management, and improve work.

专栏：答复

    答复人民日报群工部：
    你部寄来的读者来信《办厂庆突击花钱，讲排场铺张浪费》的清样收悉。对读者反映的问题，金华市纪委、监察局、兰溪市委、市纪委都很重视，进行了查处。现将中共兰溪市委给省委办公厅的报告转送你部。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　中共浙江省委办公厅信访局中共浙江省委办公厅：
    经查，兰江冶炼厂厂庆期间铺张浪费、滥发钱物的情况是存在的。主要问题是：
    一、为搞招待，花费公款７．１１万元。厂庆期间，厂里邀请了原材料供应大户，铁路、运输、供电等部门的领导人，以及有业务关系的香港客商和厂历届主要领导９８人，加上外地一些自行来的人等，吃、住、行共花费５．５８万元。另外，厂里还邀请省“小百花”越剧团来厂演出，花费１．５３万元。
    二、滥发实物。厂庆期间，厂里用福利、奖励基金发给每个职工换气扇１台、高压锅１只、厂内购货券４０元，人均１２０元，共计２８．９６万元。
    厂里还曾决定给每个职工发一张茶几，并已购回玻璃，价值２０．５４万元。后因式样未定，并考虑影响过大，未制作发放。
    三、７月至９月，厂里还发放了１９８５年至１９８７年３年的职工积余奖金１４．８４万元；同时，还发放了１９８８年上半年超产超利奖及一些零星实物、本年度书报费３４．３０万元，共计４９．１４万元，人均２００元。
    市委于１１月４日召开了常委会，初步研究了几条处理意见：
    厂庆期间花费公款７．１１万元，用于吃住行和娱乐活动，这是极其错误的，责成兰江冶炼厂作出深刻检查。
    利用厂庆名义，滥发实物，也是非常错误的。应如数退回这些实物，或在工资、奖金中扣回物款。未发放的实物一律不准再发放。
    向全厂职工发放的积余奖、超产奖、书报费及零星实物，虽属正常开支，但集中在厂庆前后发放是不妥的，应总结经验教训。其中积余奖应列入工资总额，年底按规定征收奖金税。
    鉴于兰江冶炼厂厂庆活动铺张浪费和滥发实物的错误事实及其影响，由市纪委和市监察局立案调查，并对厂里主要责任者给予必要的党纪或政纪处理；将他们的错误事实和处理意见通报给全市，引以为戒。
    目前，厂长金陆兴、党委书记韩文荣已向市委、市纪委和全厂职工作了检查；发放的实物、购货券，已于１９８８年１１月开始逐月从职工工资中扣回。厂里还制订了关于加强专控商品、业务费、现金、物价以及就餐方面的管理制度及规定，以吸取教训，加强管理，改进工作。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　中共兰溪市委
