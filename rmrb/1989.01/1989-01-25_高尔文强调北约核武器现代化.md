	Galvin Emphasizes NATO's Nuclear Weapons Modernization

    Xinhua News Agency London January 23rd

    NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Europe, Galvin, said on the 23rd that since the Soviet Union has already modernized its nuclear weapons, NATO should also modernize its nuclear weapons.

    Galvin made these remarks in response to criticism from Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze when speaking to a BBC reporter. Last week in Vienna, Shevardnadze said that the Soviet Union is engaged in large-scale disarmament, and NATO should stop the process of weapons modernization.

    Galvin said, "The Soviet Union has completed the modernization of its tactical nuclear weapons, strategic and conventional weapons. The Soviet Union has never stopped any process of weapons modernization."

    Galvin said he hopes that NATO can reduce short-range nuclear missiles as soon as possible, "but any such reduction must be linked with NATO's short-range weapons modernization."

　　高尔文强调北约核武器现代化
    新华社伦敦１月２３日电  北约欧洲盟军最高司令高尔文２３日说，由于苏联已经使其核武器现代化，北约应该实现核武器现代化。
    高尔文是在对苏联外长谢瓦尔德纳泽提出的批评作出反应时对英国广播公司记者讲这番话的。谢瓦尔德纳泽上周在维也纳说，苏联正在大规模裁军，北约应当停止武器现代化进程。
    高尔文说，“苏联已经完成了战术核武器、战略及常规武器的现代化。苏联没有停止过任何武器现代化进程。”
    高尔文说，他希望北约能尽早削减短程核导弹，“但任何这类削减行动都要同北约短程武器现代化相联系”。
