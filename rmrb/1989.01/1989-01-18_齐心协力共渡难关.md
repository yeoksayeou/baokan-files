Workers at Anshan Iron and Steel Corporation (Anshan Steel) have contributed their personal savings to help the company overcome difficulties caused by insufficient funds and coal shortages, creating a deeply moving scene. This demonstrates that in a company like Anshan Steel, workers tie their own fate to the company's prosperity and decline. Once they learn of the company's difficulties, they bravely take the lead and spare no effort to share the burden.

It should be said that workers have a sense of dependence on their own company: when the company prospers, they feel proud and secure; conversely, when the company declines, it is also a threat to them. Wise company managers understand that to run a company well, one must rely on the strength of all the workers, and first of all, make the workers feel that this company is worth loving.

The Chinese people like to say "andong tongji, tongzhou gongji," which emphasizes the importance of "shared" efforts. In a company, if the relationship between managers and workers is not properly handled, people's hearts will not be united, and it will be impossible to "share the burden." Therefore, to share the same boat and overcome difficulties together, a company needs not only strict management systems but also managers who believe in, respect, and cherish the initiative of the workers. Anshan Steel's General Manager Li Huazhong's deep bow moved many people in Anshan Steel. This sincere respect and reliance on the workers is itself a cohesive force.

Our company's workers are flesh and blood with feelings. They know how to use their actions to serve the country and the company. When the company encounters difficulties, the shared interests and sense of responsibility drive them to help the company overcome the difficulties. There are many such examples. The report in our newspaper on January 6 about the workers of Tangshan Iron and Steel Company raising funds to support key projects is one such example. For a company to develop, it is inevitable that it will encounter difficulties. Practice has proven that difficulties are not to be feared. If the difficulties are honestly told to the workers, and collective wisdom and efforts are pooled, they can be overcome!

### 齐心协力共渡难关

　　齐心协力共渡难关
    鞍钢职工纷纷拿出自己的积蓄，帮助企业克服因资金不足、煤炭紧缺的困难，演出了极其感人的一幕。它说明，在鞍钢这样的企业，职工把自己的命运同企业的兴衰紧紧联在一起了，一旦他们知道了企业遇到的困难，便奋勇当先，不遗余力地去分担。
    应该说，职工对自己企业是有依存感的：企业兴旺，他们会感到光荣，感到安全；反之，企业衰败，对他们来说，也是一种威胁。明智的企业管理者懂得，要经营好一个企业，得依靠全体职工的力量，首先是要让职工感觉到：这个企业值得爱。
    中国人喜欢说和衷共济、同舟共济，这关键就在一个“共”字上。在一个企业里，如果经营者和职工关系摆得不正，人心就不齐，就不可能“共济”。因此，要同舟共济，共渡难关，企业不仅需要严格的管理制度，更需要经营者相信职工，尊重职工，爱护职工的积极性。鞍钢总经理李华忠的深鞠一躬，感动了鞍钢上上下下许多人。这种对职工的真诚尊重和依靠，本身就是一股凝聚力。
    我们企业的职工，是有血有肉有感情的，他们懂得怎样用自己的行动来报效国家，报效企业。企业遇到了困难，共同的利益、共同的责任感驱使着他们争先恐后，帮助企业渡过难关。这方面的例子太多了。本报１月６日报道的唐山钢铁公司职工筹款保重点工程就是其中一例。企业要发展，不可能不遇到困难。实践证明，有困难不可怕，如实告诉职工，群策群力，同心协力，就能战而胜之！
