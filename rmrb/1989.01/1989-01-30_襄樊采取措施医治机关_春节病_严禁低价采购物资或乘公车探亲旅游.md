Xiangfan Takes Measures to Cure "Spring Festival Illness" in Government Agencies

Strictly Prohibit Low-Price Purchasing of Supplies or Using Public Cars for Visiting Relatives and Traveling

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, January 29 (Reporter Shi Yongfeng, Correspondent Chen Huiming) The Xiangfan Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government have taken measures to rectify the improper practices of some government agencies purchasing supplies at low prices or using public cars to visit relatives and travel before the Spring Festival.

The recent notice issued by the Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government stipulates: It is strictly forbidden for party and government agencies to demand or purchase supplies at low prices from the grassroots. Those who have already demanded or purchased supplies must return the original items if possible, or pay the difference in price according to the local market price if not. Those who refuse to comply will be fined twice the market price of the items, and the relevant personnel will be subject to disciplinary action. It is strictly forbidden to use public cars for visiting relatives, friends, or traveling. Otherwise, the individuals involved will have to pay for all fuel and other related expenses, and those with serious violations will be subject to disciplinary action.

The Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government have also dispatched supervisors to various counties, districts, and municipal agencies to oversee and inspect the implementation of these measures. They have organized the discipline inspection, supervision, audit, transportation, and news departments to conduct comprehensive supervision. Additionally, they have strengthened the reporting system and set up special checkpoints at key transportation routes. Over the past month, the city has handled the issues of 24 units and 37 government officials who demanded or purchased supplies at low prices, collecting a total of 3,390 yuan in price differences and issuing disciplinary actions to the violators. Some officials have also voluntarily canceled their plans to use public cars to visit relatives and friends during the Spring Festival.
