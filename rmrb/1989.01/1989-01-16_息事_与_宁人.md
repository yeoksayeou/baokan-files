In daily life, people often encounter situations like these:

A customer and a vendor argue endlessly because the vendor provided insufficient quantity and refuses to admit it, accusing the customer of trying to cheat him. Then, well-meaning bystanders intervene: “Come on, it’s just a few cents. Why get so worked up?” The dispute might be settled this way. But what happens next? The vendor, having escaped punishment, might become bolder and cheat more customers.

Two neighboring families get into a fight because one family caused inconvenience to the other. Then, the neighborhood committee member steps in to mediate: “You’ve been neighbors for years. Don’t let a small matter ruin your relationship.” The dispute might be temporarily resolved, but what happens later? The conflict could escalate.

There is a Chinese idiom called “息事宁人” (quelling disputes and pacifying people). Today, this idiom means resolving disputes and calming things down so that people can live in harmony. However, we must also recognize that simply quelling disputes does not necessarily lead to pacifying people. Of course, this does not mean that people should stand by and watch disputes escalate. Disputes still need to be quelled, but it depends on how they are quelled. One way is to ignore the facts, merely reconcile, and even appease the unreasonable party while wronging the reasonable party. This approach neither satisfies the reasonable party nor restrains the unreasonable party. Another way is to distinguish right from wrong, make the unreasonable party admit their mistake, and prevent them from acting unreasonably again. This approach might be troublesome, but it can effectively solve the problem. If leaders of various units and responsible persons of neighborhood committees (or mediation committees) can mediate disputes based on fairness and reason, then the social security situation will further improve.

From this, we can see that to truly achieve the goal of quelling disputes and pacifying people, the key is to adopt the correct method of quelling disputes.

### “息事”与“宁人”

　　“息事”与“宁人”
    张又兴
    在日常生活中，人们经常可以看到这样的事情：
    一个顾客与一个商贩争吵不休，原因是商贩给的分量不足，又不肯认账，说顾客讹他。于是围观的好心人说话了：“算了吧！几角钱的事儿，何必面红脖子粗？”事情也许就这样平息了。以后呢？这个商贩由于没有受到教育，很可能胆子越来越大，又去坑骗更多的顾客。
    两家邻居打架，原因是一家给另一家造成了不方便。于是居委会的干部出来劝架了：“多年的老街坊了，别为一点事儿伤了和气。”事情也许会暂时平息下去，但以后呢？矛盾可能还会激化。
    中国有句成语叫“息事宁人”。现今这个成语的意思是调解纠纷，把事情平息下去，使人们相安无事。但我们也要看到，有时单纯“息事”，未必就能“宁人”。当然，这并不是说，人们看到争吵应该袖手旁观，听任矛盾逐步激化。“事”还是要“息”的，但要看怎么个“息”法。一种“息”是不问青红皂白，一味调和，甚至试图迁就不讲道理的一方，而委屈讲道理的一方。这样的“息”法，一不能使有理的一方满意，二不能使无理的一方有所收敛。再一种“息”法是分清是非，使无理的一方认错，并且不再做无理的事情。这样做也许很麻烦，但是能够彻底解决问题。如果各单位的领导、居委会（或调解委员会）的负责人在调解纠纷时，都能做到使双方在公平合理的基础上实现和解，那么，社会治安情况就会进一步好转。
    由此可知，要真正做到息事宁人，关键是要采取正确的“息”法。
