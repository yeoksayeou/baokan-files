The commodity economy in Haicheng City, Liaoning Province, has developed rapidly in recent years. The city adheres to the policy of "two hands," one hand promoting reform and opening up to revitalize the economy, and the other hand strictly governing the Party to maintain clean governance. What should be liberalized is liberalized fully, and what should be regulated is regulated strictly, resulting in a prosperous economy and clean government. The Party's prestige among the people is high, demonstrating its great cohesion.

	Spending Wisely and Being Rich but Not Extravagant

With the deepening of reform and opening up, the economy of Haicheng City has developed rapidly. As the city becomes richer, can it maintain clean governance? The leaders of several municipal-level departments, including the Haicheng Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government, have set a model by working hard and maintaining clean governance.

In the prosperous and affluent urban and rural areas of Haicheng, there are no high-standard buildings. The municipal Party committee still operates in a flat-roofed building constructed 30 years ago, which has been repaired multiple times after being damaged by an earthquake in 1975 and is quite dilapidated. The municipal government is still in a temporary building used for the "Reconstruction of Homeland Command" after the earthquake. The frugal and modest spirit of the municipal leadership has silently influenced various levels of Party and government agencies. The Municipal Youth League and the Women's Federation are still operating in a flat-roofed building used for storing archives. The Municipal Finance, Taxation, Industry and Commerce, Prices, and Audit departments are crammed into a three-story building of less than 2,000 square meters, with even the stairwells and corridor corners partitioned into offices. Some townships with relatively rapid economic development also have few decent office buildings. The best buildings seen are middle and primary schools.

In Haicheng, there are no high-standard "Secretary Villas" or "Director Buildings" built specifically for leading cadres. The former municipal Party secretary, Yu Junbo, has been living in three ordinary flat-roofed rooms since he was a technician. The current municipal Party secretary, Yu Zhiquan, lives with his family of five in two and a half ordinary rooms. To facilitate late-night work and reception, he recently raised funds to buy an additional room. Other municipal Party leaders mostly live in ordinary residential buildings, each with a standard of two and a half rooms.

Haicheng is rich, and the economy is vibrant. Why can it still maintain clean governance and not squander money? Municipal Party Secretary Yu Zhiquan said, "Reform and opening up have indeed brought vitality to Haicheng's economy. However, no matter how rich we are, funds are limited. After the county was upgraded to a city, all industries need development. The guiding ideology of the Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government is to work hard and spend money wisely, being rich but not extravagant."

	Both Guiding Thought and Party Members' Exemplary Role

The Haicheng Municipal Party Committee plays a leading role in reform and opening up, paying great attention to guiding thought. At the beginning of comprehensive reform, the Municipal Party Committee invested a lot of effort in investigating and analyzing the city's situation and sent people out multiple times to learn from others, consciously breaking away from conservative thinking and "leftist" influences, guiding Party members and the masses to liberate their minds, change their concepts, and promote reform and opening up and the development of the commodity economy. In the midst of the liberation of thought, the Municipal Party Committee promptly educated Party members and cadres on the Party's basic line, correcting the tendency to weaken and relax Party leadership.

In Haicheng, strengthening Party leadership is not just a general call or a principle slogan, but is reflected in the exemplary role of the vast majority of Party members. In Nantai Township, 870 out of 1,400 Party members participate in commodity production or business activities, with 60% of Party members playing an exemplary role in commodity production. Two years ago, Tuhuipu Village attempted to cultivate 600 mu of shrimp, but failed. The Party branch leader did not lose heart and led others to investigate and learn from others. Last year, they selected a site in Shandong to cultivate 1,600 mu of shrimp, achieving a bumper harvest and earning a net profit of over 2 million yuan.

According to investigations, the four major commodity production bases in Haicheng, including leather products, winter vegetables, clothing, and magnesite sand, as well as some key township and village enterprises, were all initiated by Communist Party members. Mao Jincai, a Party member from Niuzhuang Township, took over the loss-making civilian machinery factory in 1984 despite being wrongly expelled from the Party. He overcame difficulties, engaged in horizontal cooperation, and actively opened up production, supply, and sales channels, making the enterprise take three big steps in three years, achieving a production value of 100 million yuan and a profit of 10 million yuan last year. It is proven that he is an outstanding Communist Party member, and the organization has corrected the wrong handling of his case.

	Protecting Reform and Maintaining Discipline

Last summer, a central inspection team, after inspecting Haicheng City, said, "Haicheng's economy is developing rapidly and is vibrant, but the wrong trend of government agencies engaging in business and establishing enterprises has not arisen, which is truly rare!"

Similar situations are not limited to this. The panic buying that occurred last year came late and ended early in Haicheng, and most of the buyers were from outside the city. The wrong trends of levies, sponsorships, official trips, and housing allocation have also disappeared here.

When asked why Haicheng has such a situation, the municipal Party Committee leaders said that comprehensive reform started early here, the thoughts of cadres and the masses are relatively liberated, and the awareness of the commodity economy is strong. It is not enough to just promote reform and opening up and relax discipline. There was once a saying in society, "Encountering a red light, go around it." The Haicheng Municipal Party Committee's attitude is clear: "Go around with whom? Go around to where? If the Municipal Party Committee and higher authorities go around, the lower levels will also go around the Municipal Party Committee. If everyone goes around like this, the Party's discipline will be gone, and reform and opening up will also be distorted!" The Municipal Party Committee clearly proposed: support reformers, encourage explorers, help those who make mistakes, and investigate violators.

The Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government leaders strictly require themselves, and for cases involving leading agencies and leading cadres that disrupt economic order, they do not cover up or fear exposure, and firmly investigate and punish. The former director of the Municipal Post and Telecommunications Bureau, Guo Chengming, used his position to violate the tobacco monopoly regulations and postal discipline, mailing cigarettes for his relatives seven times, totaling 280 packages, with a business volume of over 90,000 yuan. Under his influence, more than 100 employees in this bureau mailed and picked up cigarettes for social tobacco dealers, with some even investing and sharing profits, illegally seeking excessive profits. The Municipal Party Secretary and Municipal Discipline Inspection Commission Secretary personally handled the case and quickly investigated and punished it. Among them, 10 Party members were given disciplinary actions, and Guo Chengming was removed from his position as director and given a one-year probation period. Since 1984, the entire city has publicly handled disciplinary Party members and cadres at all levels, punishing 462 disciplinary Party members, including expelling 86 from the Party and giving 125 a probation period. Among them, 32 were at the section chief level and above. The Municipal Party Committee alone has held 8 public handling meetings, with 36 people expelled from the Party.

Haicheng City has also established a public service system in departments such as personnel, real estate, industry and commerce, taxation, and public security. The Municipal Organization and Personnel Department publicly selects Party and government leading cadres, publicly appoints newly recruited government officials, and employs enterprise leading cadres through recruitment, increasing the transparency of personnel work. Last year, 10 deputy bureau-level and above leading cadres were publicly selected and recruited, 50 government officials were publicly appointed and recruited, and there were no petitions or complaints.

　　海城市商品经济发展快，但没有机关经商办企业，原因在于——
    既抓改革开放　又抓从严治党
    辽宁省海城市近几年来坚持“两手抓”的方针，一手抓改革开放，搞活经济，一手抓从严治党，为政清廉。该放的放活、放足、放够，该管的管严、管紧、管住，出现了经济繁荣，党政机关廉洁的新局面，党在群众中的威望很高，显示出巨大的凝聚力。
    　　　　花钱有道　富而不奢
    随着改革开放的深入，海城市经济发展很快。富起来还要不要保持廉洁，能不能保持廉洁？海城市委、市政府等几个市级班子的领导同志，艰苦创业，保持廉洁，起到了模范带头作用。
    在经济繁荣、生活富裕的海城城乡，看不见一座高标准的楼堂馆所。市委机关仍在一座３０年前盖的平房里办公，１９７５年地震破坏后，多次修补，十分简陋。市政府机关还在地震后“重建家园指挥部”的简易楼里。市级领导机关廉洁俭朴的精神，无声地影响着各级党政机关。团市委、妇联仍在存放档案的平房中办公。市财政、税务、工商、物价、审计等５个业务局，挤在一个不到２０００平方米的三层楼里，连楼梯口、走廊角都间壁成了办公室。一些经济发展比较快的乡镇，也很少有像样的办公楼。所看到的最好的房子，都是中小学校。
    在海城，也看不到专为领导干部建的高标准的“书记院”、“局长楼”。前任市委书记于钧波，一直住在他任技术员时住的三间普通平房。现任市委书记于治权，五口之家住在两间半普通住房里。为晚间工作需要和接待方便，最近他自己筹款买了一间住房。其他市委领导同志，大多住在普通居民楼中，标准也是二间半房。
    海城富，经济搞得也活，为什么还能保持廉洁，有钱不滥花？市委书记于治权说：“改革开放确实给海城市经济带来了活力，然而，再富有，资金也是有限的，县改市后百业待兴，市委、市政府的指导思想就是艰苦创业，花钱有道，富而不奢。”
    　　　　既抓思想导航　又抓党员模范作用
    海城市委在改革开放中发挥党的领导作用，十分注意抓思想导航。在全面改革开始时，市委下很大力量调查分析海城的市情，并多次派人外出考察，自觉地破除保守思想和“左”的影响，引导党员和群众解放思想，转变观念，推动了改革开放和商品经济的发展。在解放思想的热潮中，市委及时对党员干部进行党的基本路线教育，纠正削弱和放松党的领导的倾向。
    在海城，加强党的领导不是一般号召和原则口号，而体现在广大党员的先锋模范作用中。南台镇１４００多名党员，有８７０多名参加商品生产或经商活动，６０％的党员在商品生产中发挥了先锋模范作用。土河铺村前年搞６００亩对虾养殖，失败了，党支部负责人没有泄气，又带人在外考察，去年在山东选点养虾１６００亩，获得了丰收，净得２００多万元。
    据调查，海城市的革制品、冬鲜菜、服装、镁砂等四大商品生产基地，包括一些重点的乡镇村企业，都是共产党员带头搞起来的。牛庄镇的共产党员毛金财，１９８４年背着被错误开除党籍的包袱，冒着风险承包了连续亏损的民用机械厂。他克服困难，搞横向联合，积极打通产、供、销渠道，使企业三年迈出三大步，去年达到１亿元产值，利润１０００万元。事实证明，他是优秀的共产党员，组织上已经纠正了对他的错误处理。
    　　　　保护改革　严明纪律
    去年夏天，中央一检查组在海城市检查后，检查组负责同志说：“海城经济发展快，搞得活，党政机关经商办企业的歪风却没有刮起来，真是难得！”
    类似的情况还不只如此。去年一度出现的抢购风，这里来得晚，走得早，并且多是外地人到海城抢购。摊派、赞助、公费旅游和建房分房中的不正之风，在这里也销声匿迹了。
    谈到海城为什么会出现这种形势，市委领导同志说，这里综合配套改革起步早，干部、群众的思想比较解放，商品经济意识强，不能只抓改革开放，放松了纪律。社会上一度流传“遇到红灯绕道走”，海城市委态度鲜明：“和谁绕，往哪绕？如果市委和上面绕，和中央绕，下面也会和市委绕，这样层层绕来绕去，党的纪律绕没了，改革开放也要走样！”市委明确提出：支持改革者，鼓励探索者，帮助失误者，查处违纪者。
    市委、市政府领导严格要求自己，对涉及领导机关、领导干部扰乱经济秩序的违法乱纪案件，他们不护短，不怕丑，坚决查处。原市邮电局局长郭成明利用职权之便，违反烟草专卖条例和邮政纪律，先后７次为亲属邮运卷烟２８０多件，经营额达９万多元。在他的影响下，这个局有１００多名职工为社会烟贩子代邮代取，有的还投资入股，非法牟取暴利。市委书记、市纪委书记亲自包案、办案，迅速进行查处。对其中１０名党员给予了党纪处分，郭成明被撤销局长职务，留党察看一年。１９８４年以来，全市层层公开处理违纪党员干部，共处分违纪党员４６２人，其中开除党籍８６人，受留党察看处分的１２５人，科级以上干部３２人。仅市委召开的公开处理大会就有８次，有３６人被开除党籍。
    海城市还在人事、房产、工商、税务、公安等部门，建立了公开办事制度。市组织人事部门对党政领导干部实行公开选拔，对新录用的机关干部实行公开考任，对企业领导干部实行招聘制，增加了干部人事工作的透明度。去年公开选拔、招聘副局级以上领导干部１０名，公开考任录用机关干部５０名，没有出现一个上访告状的。
