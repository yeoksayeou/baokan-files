Prince Sihanouk issued a statement yesterday emphasizing that he has not abandoned his five-principled proposals for resolving the Cambodian issue.

A spokesperson for Prince Sihanouk's private representative office in Bangkok told our reporter today that Prince Sihanouk's statement was intended to clarify misinterpretations of his discussions with the Indonesian Foreign Minister. There were reports that Prince Sihanouk had softened his stance on his five-point proposals during a recent meeting with Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas in Paris, particularly regarding the dissolution of the Phnom Penh government and the deployment of an international peacekeeping force to oversee the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops. Prince Sihanouk issued the statement through his private representative office in Bangkok to clarify these misinterpretations.

In his statement, Sihanouk asserted that he has not abandoned the aforementioned two crucial points of his five-point proposal, nor has he abandoned his entire five-point peace proposal.

　　西哈努克亲王发表声明
    坚持解决柬问题五点建议
    本报曼谷１月１４日电  记者刘爱成报道：西哈努克亲王昨天发表声明，强调他没有放弃他提出的解决柬埔寨问题的５项原则性建议。
    西哈努克亲王驻曼谷的私人代表处发言人今天对本报记者说，西哈努克亲王的这一声明是为了澄清对他与印尼外长会谈内容的误传。有消息说，西哈努克亲王最近与印尼外长阿拉塔斯在巴黎举行会谈时对他的５点建议立场有所软化，西哈努克亲王已不再坚持５点建议中关于解散金边政权和派国际维护和平部队监督越南撤军这两点内容。西哈努克亲王为此特通过他在曼谷的私人代表处发表声明加以澄清。
    西哈努克在声明中说，他没有放弃５点建议中的上述两个重要建议，也没有放弃他的整个５点和平建议。
