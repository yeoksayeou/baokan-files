    More than 20 counties produce 10,000 taels of gold
    The "golden triangles" of Shaanxi, Gansu, Sichuan, and Guizhou, Guangxi, Yunnan will become new gold production bases in China
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 7 (Reporter Zhao Mingliang) The head of the National Gold Mine Geological Work Leading Group, Zhu Xun, recently revealed: As of now, except for Shanghai, all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in China have discovered gold mines, making China one of the world's major gold-producing countries.

    In the past three years, the results of gold mine geological exploration have been particularly remarkable. More than 400 new gold deposits and mineral points have been discovered, and more than a thousand gold anomalies have been found using geochemical methods. What is exciting is that a batch of new gold belts has been discovered by geologists, including the "golden triangles" of Shaanxi, Gansu, Sichuan, and Guizhou, Guangxi, Yunnan. Experts believe that these two "golden triangles" will become new gold production bases in China.

    With the development of gold mine geological work, China's gold production capacity has also been continuously increasing. In recent years, more than 100 primary gold mines of different scales and a large number of placer gold mines have been built, and the number of counties producing 10,000 taels of gold has increased to more than 20.

    It is reported that Jiaodong, Yuxi, Heilongjiang, Shaanxi, Gansu, Sichuan, and Hebei have become the main gold resource and production bases in China. Among them, Jiaodong's gold production ranks first in the country; Heilongjiang, known as the "golden edge," has become China's main gold production base for placer gold.

　　产金万两县增至廿多个
    陕甘川和黔桂滇两个“金三角” 
    将成为我国新的黄金生产基地
    据新华社北京１月７日电  （记者赵明亮）全国金矿地质工作领导小组组长朱训日前透露：截至目前为止，我国除上海市外，其他各省、市、自治区都已发现金矿，成为世界上重要的产金国之一。
    近３年来，金矿地质勘查的成果尤为显著。新发现的金矿床和矿点４００多处，用地球化学方法发现的金异常有上千处。令人振奋的是，一批新的金矿带已被地质工作者发现，其中包括陕、甘、川和黔、桂、滇两个“金三角”。专家认为，这两个“金三角”将成为我国新的黄金生产基地。
    随着金矿地质工作的发展，我国黄金生产能力也不断增加。近年来，建成了１００多座不同规模的原生金矿山和一大批砂金矿，产金万两县已增加到２０多个。
    据介绍，胶东、豫西、黑龙江、陕、甘、川和河北已成为我国目前主要的黄金资源和生产基地。其中胶东地区的黄金产量居全国首位；素有“金镶边”之称的黑龙江地区已成为我国以产砂金为主的黄金生产基地。
