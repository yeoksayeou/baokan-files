Oh, 1989

The New Year's chimes ring as scheduled, telling a familiar story yet always with new twists.

The chimes of my childhood were light and joyful! They brought me a table full of delicious dishes, the falling petals of firecrackers in the snow, new clothes made of flowery fabric, and the lucky money from Grandma...

Gradually, the chimes took on a hint of sadness. When they struck the years of my youth, they carried an indescribable taste: time had passed, but there were unfulfilled wishes left behind on the path of the previous year. A beautiful calendar, a string of fresh days, again displayed new thoughts of love and the longing to be loved, dreams of imminent success and enduring friendships...

The chimes are knocking at the door again.

Last night, I held its hand, pleading with it to wait for me a moment, to strike the final chime slowly. It evaded me, turning into a long, cold thread, slipping through my palm, and suddenly looking back at me from the other end of midnight: "I no longer belong to you!" it said with a smile. Forever, I lost my 1988!

The auspicious snow did not fall, and the chimes, behind the orange glow of the desk lamp, watched me say goodbye. In the moment it vanished, you loudly said: "Welcome me, do not use tears!"

Oh, 1989, you have come like this!

The cup in my hand, not yet emptied, is filled again. The New Year has no boundaries on the earth, but it plows a furrow in the heart. On one side is the past, on the other is the future, and I stand in the middle, always losing when I gain, and gaining when I lose.

The alarm clock on the table ticks forward with an unchanging rhythm, but it is no longer the light footsteps of childhood...

I cannot help but ponder in this night: counting past events, calculating gains and losses; I cannot help but feel melancholy in this night: time flies, ambitions unfulfilled...

The fantasy of survival expands at this moment, the self-respect and pride of being human rise at this hour, thousands of insights and hopes, born of this end-of-year silence, enter the new dawn!

Since life will not pause at any hour or moment, I will no longer grieve for everything lost. I want to be a happy child, chasing the new day, with a joyful heart, watching my own growth in wisdom. I will no longer deliberately shape myself, but accept myself with flaws and imperfections, experiencing the taste of growth. Abandon all low and dark emotions, with a surprised heart, praise the snow, the buds, the earth, and myself. I should have the joy of the harvester and the composure of the victor, in every future end-of-year, every future New Year... Oh, 1989, I see you, as in the dawn of ancient creation!

　　哦，一九八九
    姜丽莉
    新年钟声，如约敲响一个熟悉的故事，却又每每有新意。
    幼时的钟声，轻松，快乐！它带给我满桌丰盛的佳肴，雪地上鞭炮的落英，花布新衣服和奶奶给的压岁钱……
    渐渐地，钟声多了点哀怨。当它敲打青春的岁月，则带着难言的滋味：时光已逝，却有未竟的夙愿遗落在去年途中。一本精美的挂历，一串新鲜的日子，又展示了新的爱的思量和被爱的渴望，成功在即及友谊长存的梦想……
    钟声又来叩门了。
    昨夜，我挽着它的手，恳求它等我一刻，慢点敲那最后的一下。它躲闪着，变成又长又凉的细丝，从我的掌心穿过，在子夜的那端蓦然回首：我不再属于你！它笑着说。永远地，我失去了，我的一九八八！
    瑞雪没有飞来，钟声在台灯桔黄色的光圈后面，静观我和它辞别。在它遁去的那一刹那，你大声说：迎接我，不要用眼泪！
    噢，一九八九，你就这样来了！
    我手中的杯，还未掏空，又被装满。新年在大地上没有界标，却在心田上犁出一道垄沟。一边是过去，一边是未来，而我站在中间，总在失去的时候得到，又在得到的时候失去。
    桌上的闹钟以一成不变的节奏朝前走着，但已不是童年那轻快的脚步了……
    总禁不住要在这一个夜里思量：细数往事，计算得失；总禁不住要在这一个夜里惆怅：时光飞逝，壮志未酬……
    生存的幻想在这时刻扩大了，做人的自尊心和自豪感在这时候抬头了，千百种感悟与希望，脱胎于这岁末的静夜，进入崭新的黎明！
    既然生命不会驻足在任何一个时辰与境界，我将不再为失去的一切忧伤。我要做个快乐的孩子，去追逐新日，以喜悦的心情，看着自己心智的成长。我不再刻意塑造自我，而坦然地接受有着弱点与缺陷的自我，从中体会成长的滋味。放弃一切低沉暗淡的情绪，以惊喜的心情赞美雪、春芽、大地和我自己。我该有收获者的喜悦和得胜者的从容，在每一个未来的岁末，未来的新年……噢，一九八九，我看见了你，如在远古创世的清晨！
