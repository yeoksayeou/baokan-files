The impact of population growth on economic development can be analyzed from both direct and indirect perspectives. Raising a child to become a labor force requires both the state and the family to incur certain costs. Currently, the total cost of raising a labor force in urban areas is 13,273 yuan, with the state contributing 28%, or 3,840.74 yuan. In towns, the total cost of raising a labor force is 8,771.18 yuan, with the state contributing 12%, or 1,015.38 yuan. In rural areas, the total cost of raising a labor force is 2,909.37 yuan, with the state contributing 1.26%, or 367.01 yuan. Since the implementation of family planning, China has reduced the number of births by 110 million. Assuming 30% of these are in urban areas, this roughly saves the state nearly 200 billion yuan in educational expenses. Of course, some of these costs are to be borne in the future. The savings for families are difficult to estimate. Therefore, reducing the number of births saves the state approximately 13 billion yuan annually.

The more significant impact of family planning on economic development lies in its indirect effects. An increase in the birth rate requires more consumer goods, which in turn necessitates more labor to produce these goods, leading to increased investment. This forms a long chain of how population growth affects economic production demand. When the annual population growth rate is 1%, the national income growth rate must be greater than 1% to maintain the same level of consumption. Based on China's investment coefficient, an annual population growth rate of 1% requires a national income growth rate of approximately 3% to maintain the same living standards. If we assume an average of 6.5 million fewer births per year, this is equivalent to an annual increase of over 10 billion yuan in national income. In recent years, this has been equivalent to an increase of 15 to 18 billion yuan. This is a significant contribution of family planning. This work must be sustained over the long term.

　　计划生育对经济的积极影响
    人口增长对经济发展的短期影响可以从直接和间接两个方面来分析：将一个婴儿抚养、培育成为一名劳动力，国家和家庭都要付出一定的代价。按目前物价在城市培养一个劳动力的总费用为１３２７３元，其中国家支出２８％，即３８４０．７４元；在城镇培养一个劳动力的总费用为８７７１．１８元，其中国家支出１２％，即１０１５．３８元；在农村培养一个劳动力的总费用为２９０９．３７元，其中国家支出１．２６％，即３６７．０１元。我国推行计划生育以来少生了１．１亿孩子，若以３０％在城市计，大约可为国家节省培育费用近２０００亿元。当然，其中部分的费用是应在未来支出的。家庭节省的费用难以估计。因此，少生孩子对中国来说平均每年国家大约可节省直接支出１３０亿元。
    计划生育对经济发展的更大的影响在于间接作用。出生率提高就需要更多的消费品，为生产这些消费品又要有劳动者，为此要增加新的投资，这样形成一条人口出生影响对经济生产需求的长链。当人口年增长率为１％时，国民收入的增长率必须大于１％才能保持消费水平不下降。按中国的投资系数估计，人口年增长率为１％，保持生活水平不下降的国民收入年增长率约为３％。若按每年平均少生６５０万婴儿计，则相当于每年平均增加了国民收入１００亿以上，近年则相当于增加１５０亿到１８０亿元，这是计划生育的一项重要贡献。这项工作必须长期坚持下去。　　　　　　　　　（《人口与经济》１９８８年第６期）
