	Recently, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) issued 2.6 billion yuan in loans to enrich the market supply for the upcoming festival and to reserve raw materials for the production of key industrial products.

	Since the second half of last year, the state has implemented a tightening policy to curb inflation, leading to a severe shortage of credit funds at ICBC. Under these circumstances, ICBC has, on one hand, vigorously attracted residents' savings deposits to supplement the sources of credit funds; on the other hand, it has actively adjusted the credit structure, expanded effective supply, helped enterprises reduce inventory, tapped into the potential of existing funds, and thus alleviated the difficulty in fund supply.

	Of the 2.6 billion yuan in new loans issued by ICBC, 1.36 billion yuan is used to support the production of raw materials for daily necessities and key industrial products. Over 100 million yuan in commercial loans has been issued, mainly for the procurement of grains, cotton, oil, meat, poultry, eggs, and other agricultural products, ensuring the supply of goods in the festival market.

　　为市场供应和原材料储备提供保障
    工商银行新增贷款２６０亿
    本报讯  记者梅洪如报道：最近，中国工商银行发放贷款２６０亿元，用于丰富节日市场供应和重要工业品生产的原材料储备。
    自去年下半年以来，国家采取紧缩方针，治理通货膨胀，工商银行信贷资金严重短缺。在这种情况下，他们一方面大力吸收居民储蓄存款，补充信贷资金来源；另一方面积极调整信贷结构，扩大有效供给，帮助企业压缩库存，挖掘现有资金潜力，使资金供给困难的局面得到缓解。
    在工商银行新增加的２６０亿贷款中，用于支持生产人民生活必需品和重要工业品的原材料储备的有１３６亿元；发放商业贷款１００多亿元，主要用于粮、棉、油、肉、禽、蛋等农副产品的收购，使节日市场的商品供应有了保障。
