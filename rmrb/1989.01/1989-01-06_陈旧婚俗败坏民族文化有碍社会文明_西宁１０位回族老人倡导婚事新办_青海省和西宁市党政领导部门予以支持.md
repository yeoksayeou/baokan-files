Outdated marriage customs harm national culture and impede social civilization. Ten elderly Hui people in Xining advocate for new marriage practices. The Party and government leaders of Qinghai Province and Xining City offer their support.

XINING, Jan. 5 (Xinhua) — In the Dongguan district of Xining, Qinghai Province, where many Hui people reside, ten elderly Hui individuals, including Han Wenbin and Ma Mingyue, recently issued a call to the Hui people of the entire city. They advocated for reforming the various cumbersome outdated customs in weddings, opposing extravagance and waste in marriage ceremonies, and suggested frugal and civilized wedding practices.

In recent years, the trend of extravagant and wasteful weddings has become increasingly prevalent in Xining City. Particularly, the traditionally frugal Hui weddings have now added numerous elaborate customs, with wedding expenses rising significantly. The cost of a wedding ranges from a minimum of seven or eight thousand yuan to over ten thousand yuan, with an average of nearly five small cars used for the ceremony. Many families find this financial burden unbearable. The ten elderly Hui individuals are deeply concerned about this issue. They appointed Ma Mingyue as the draftsman and wrote a "Call to Action" advocating for the reform of cumbersome wedding customs and promoting new marriage practices. This "Call to Action" lists numerous facts, exposing the reality of wealth worship in Hui weddings in the Xining area, reflecting the urgent desire of the broad Hui community to reduce wedding expenses, and proposing many specific suggestions for changing customs and promoting frugality and civilization. With great enthusiasm, they loudly declare: "Excessive extravagance and the rampant spread of outdated customs have corrupted national culture, hindered social civilization, and violated the dignity of the holy teachings. We cannot let ignorance and backwardness consume us. We must march towards science, culture, civilization, etiquette, and truth! Let us break free from the shackles of outdated customs, lift our spirits, boldly advocate, and rationally innovate, to quickly change the old face of Hui people's weddings in Xining."

The call to action by these ten elderly Hui individuals has received enthusiastic support and encouragement from the Party and government leaders of Qinghai Province and Xining City, and has sparked a heated response among the Muslim community in the entire city. Han Shenggui, the president of the Qinghai Provincial Islamic Association and the director of the Xining Dongguan Mosque Management Committee, highly praises the call to action by the ten elderly Hui individuals. He used the opportunity of leading prayers to conduct extensive propaganda among the believers. Some street offices and neighborhood committees in the Chengdong District of Xining have also organized discussion meetings, expressing their support for this call to action. A responsible comrade from the Qinghai Provincial Spiritual Civilization Construction Coordination Office hopes that all ethnic groups in the province will actively respond to the call to action by the Hui compatriots during the 1989 New Year and Spring Festival, change customs, and work together to build socialist spiritual civilization.

　　陈旧婚俗败坏民族文化有碍社会文明
    西宁１０位回族老人倡导婚事新办
    青海省和西宁市党政领导部门予以支持
    新华社西宁１月５日电  （记者王宏伟）回族群众聚居的青海省西宁市东关地区的韩文斌、马鸣岳等１０位回族老人，最近向全市回族群众发出倡议书，倡导改革婚礼中各种繁缛的陈规陋习，反对婚事中的铺张浪费，建议节俭文明办婚事。
    近年来，西宁市婚事大操大办、铺张浪费之风越来越盛，特别是历来较为俭朴的回族婚礼，如今也增添了许多名目繁多的礼俗，婚礼花费越来越多，开支少则七八千，多则逾万元，婚礼用小轿车平均近５辆，许多家庭不堪重负。对此，１０位回族老人感到十分忧虑，于是推举马鸣岳为执笔人，写出了关于改革繁缛礼俗的旧婚姻，倡导婚事新办的《倡议书》。这份《倡议书》列举了大量事实，揭示了西宁地区回族婚礼的拜金现实，反映广大回族群众不堪重负，希望节俭办婚礼的迫切愿望，提出了许多移风易俗、节俭文明的具体建议。他们以满腔的热情大声疾呼：“过于铺张，泛滥成灾的陈规陋俗，败坏了民族文化，有碍于社会文明，也违背了圣教尊严。我们不能让愚昧落后和无知所吞噬，我们要向科学、文化、文明、礼貌、真理进军！让我们挣脱陈规陋习的羁绊，振起精神，大胆地提倡，合理地革新，尽快改变西宁回民办喜事的旧面貌。”
    这１０位回族老人的倡议，受到青海省和西宁市党政领导部门的热情支持和鼓励，也在全市穆斯林群众中引起热烈反响。青海省伊斯兰教协会主任、西宁东关清真大寺寺管会主任韩生贵对１０位回族老人的倡议十分赞赏，他利用作礼拜之机向信教群众进行了广泛的宣传。西宁市城东区的一些街道办事处和居委会，也纷纷组织讨论会，表示响应这一倡议。青海省精神文明建设协调办公室的负责同志希望全省各族人民在１９８９年元旦春节期间，积极响应回族同胞的倡议，移风易俗，为建设社会主义精神文明共同努力。
