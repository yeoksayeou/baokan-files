A Shanghai university student who suffered severe coal gas poisoning (carbon monoxide poisoning) was successfully treated and recovered after being in a deep coma for 39 days. The student was discharged from the hospital on January 13.

On September 16 last year, the 20-year-old female student was admitted to Ruijin Hospital, affiliated with the Second Military Medical University of Shanghai, 18 hours after the poisoning incident. Due to the severity of the poisoning and the delay in treatment, conventional methods were ineffective. The head of the hyperbaric oxygen chamber in the hospital's surgery department, Deputy Chief Physician Xu Peng, the only mainland Chinese member of the American Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society, along with Deputy Chief Physician Hu Xiu'e from the internal medicine department, bravely revised the treatment plan. They continued with hyperbaric oxygen therapy while also implementing respiratory therapy, high-dose medication under pressure, and other measures. Under the meticulous care of nurses Xu Saiqing and Cao Rongrong, the student finally regained consciousness on October 24.

As her physical strength recovered, the patient's intelligence also returned to its original level. She could recite long poems, translate foreign languages, and quickly solve complex higher mathematics problems. After more than two months of consolidating the treatment effects, it was confirmed that the patient had fully recovered with no aftereffects.

　　上海一大学生煤气中毒
    深昏迷３９天后救治康复
    新华社上海１月１４日电  （通讯员胡德荣）１名严重煤气中毒（即一氧化碳中毒）的２０岁女大学生，经上海第二医科大学附属瑞金医院救治，在深昏迷３９天后清醒，１３日康复出院。
    去年９月１６日下午，这位中毒女大学生在耽搁了１８个小时之后才转到瑞金医院进行高压氧抢救。由于病人中毒程度深，又拖了时间，按常规治疗已无济于事。该院外科高压氧室主任、中国大陆唯一被接纳为美国海底及高压医学学会会员的徐鹏副主任医师会同内科胡秀娥副主任医师，大胆地修正了治疗方案，一面继续进行高压氧疗法，一面又采用呼吸理疗、加压大剂量用药等一系列措施，在徐赛珍、曹蓉蓉两位护士长的精心护理下，女大学生终于在１０月２４日苏醒过来。
    随着体力的恢复，患者的智力也恢复到原有水平，不仅能背长诗，能翻译外语，还能迅速地解答有一定难度的高等数学题。后经两个多月的疗效巩固，证实病人已完全治愈，没有后遗症。
