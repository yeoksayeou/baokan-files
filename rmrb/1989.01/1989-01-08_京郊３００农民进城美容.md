People are never satisfied with the status quo. After filling their wallets with stacks of "big notes," they begin to ponder spiritual pursuits. Nowadays, when farmers go to the city to visit a hospital, it's not necessarily to see a doctor or get a prescription. Some are there for beauty treatments. The Beijing Military Region General Hospital has received over 300 farmers from the suburban districts and counties this year. Some are getting "moles removed," others are getting "dimples added," and some are getting their "canine teeth straightened"...

Before the New Year, in the outpatient department of this hospital, several young women from Daxing County were waiting for their turn. They were preparing to undergo double eyelid surgery, their excited eyes betraying a hint of nervousness. Someone asked, "Why did you decide to get double eyelid surgery?" The shorter girl eagerly replied, "We are applying to be hotel service staff, and we heard that the first round is a face-to-face interview. Appearance is very important." The taller girl added cheerfully, "Even when looking for a partner, they first look at your face. Inner beauty is important, but outer beauty is also good."

A young man from Pinggu County sat on the examination table, timidly asking, "Doctor, can the freckles on my face be treated?" The doctor reassured him, "That's easy. Just apply freckle remover, and in a week, the pigment will disappear." The young man heard this and jumped up in joy. As he left, he told the doctor, "Before, I was most afraid of looking in the mirror. After the freckles are gone, the first thing I'll do is take a color photograph."

　　京郊３００农民进城美容
    人们总是不满足现状，腰包中装上成叠的“大团结”之后，就开始琢磨精神上的追求。现在农民进城上医院，可不一定就是看病开药，有一些人是在进行美容治疗呢。北京军区总医院今年就接待了３００多名京郊区县的农民，他们有的“磨雀斑”，有的“点酒窝”，有的“正虎牙”……爱美之心，人皆有之，１０多年前被认为是资产阶级臭思想的东西，如今却堂而皇之地在大雅之堂找到了它的位置。
    元旦前，在这家医院门诊部，大兴县来的几位姑娘正在候诊，她们准备做双眼皮手术，兴奋的目光中透出一丝紧张。有人问道：“你们怎么想起来做双眼皮手术？”矮个子姑娘抢着说：“我们要报考饭店服务员，听说第一关就是面试，形象美很重要呢。”高个子姑娘爽朗地补充道：“谈对象还要先相面呢，心灵美，外表最好也美。”
    一位平谷县来的小伙子坐在诊查桌前，怯生生地问：“大夫，脸上的雀斑能治吗？”医生轻松地说：“这很容易，只要涂上雀斑灵，一周以后色素就可以消失。”小伙子听了，高兴地跳起来。临走时，他对医生说：“以前我最害怕照镜子，治好雀斑后，我第一件事就是照一个彩色像片。”　　　　　（张梅珍）
