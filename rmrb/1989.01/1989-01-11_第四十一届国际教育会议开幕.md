Nearly 100 countries' representatives discuss the status and prospects of post-secondary education

Li Tieying emphasizes that China must change its backward educational face to meet the needs of the 21st century

According to Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, January 9th: (Reporters Li Ruifeng and Shi Guangyao) The 41st International Education Conference opened today in Geneva. Nearly 100 countries' high-level officials in charge of education, university presidents, and researchers attended the conference to discuss the status and prospects of post-secondary education.

UNESCO Director-General Federico Mayor in his opening remarks said that post-secondary education has become an indispensable prerequisite for solving various problems and mastering scientific and technological methods.

Mayor emphasized the importance of post-secondary education in his speech. He pointed out that a country's future depends on its level of knowledge, and therefore also depends on its teachers and intellectuals.

The International Education Conference, convened by UNESCO, is held every two years in Geneva and is considered the highest-level conference in the international education community.

Many countries' ministers of education participated in this year's conference. Chinese State Councilor and Minister of the State Education Commission Li Tieying led the Chinese delegation to attend.

The theme of this conference is: "Policies and Strategies for Post-Secondary Education and Training." During the 9-day conference, representatives from various countries will also discuss new trends in post-secondary education, the diversification of post-secondary education to adapt to employment, and other issues.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, January 10th: Li Tieying, leading the Chinese education delegation to participate in the 41st International Education Conference, pointed out today that the Chinese government is committed to developing and reforming post-secondary education, striving to establish a new educational system that can meet the needs of China's economic, scientific, and social development in the 21st century, including a flexible structure and diversified post-secondary education.

He said: "Education has always been a sacred cause and is also an important area that determines the fate of humanity. China must change its current backward economic and cultural face, and by the end of the next century, reach the level of a moderately developed country. The fundamental way out is to improve the quality of workers and cultivate a large number of qualified talents to meet the needs of economic and social development, transforming China's rich human resources into a great intellectual resource."

He said: "Our country is taking the development and prosperity of the education cause as the primary strategic task of economic and social development, and is also studying and formulating an education development strategy for the 21st century."

He pointed out that since the founding of the People's Republic of China, especially in the past 10 years, China's education cause has made significant progress in reform.

He pointed out that it can be said that China has initially formed a post-secondary education system with multiple levels, types, and forms, comprehensive disciplines, and a considerable scale.

He said: "Post-secondary education plays a huge promoting role in economic construction, scientific and technological progress, and social development, and must serve economic construction, scientific and technological progress, and social development, making education and economy mutually promote and coordinate development."

He said: "This is the fundamental guiding ideology for China's development and reform of post-secondary education."

Li Tieying also mentioned a series of policies that the Chinese government has formulated for the development and reform of post-secondary education. These policies mainly include: according to the actual needs of economic, scientific, and social development, vigorously strengthening and developing disciplines with high social demand, while also paying attention to protecting and supporting the development of basic disciplines; promoting the diversification of post-secondary education models; taking improving education quality as the core link of post-secondary education; encouraging social participation and support for the post-secondary education cause; expanding the autonomy of schools in running schools, and reducing government administrative interference in the school-running process.

However, Li Tieying also frankly pointed out that at present, China's post-secondary education system is still very imperfect, various levels of vocational and technical education and training are relatively weak, curriculum settings, practical links, teaching content, and methods are not adapted to social needs, and there are still many problems in moral education and physical fitness.

　　第四十一届国际教育会议开幕
    近百国代表探讨中学后教育的现状和发展前景
    李铁映发言强调中国要改变教育落后面貌以适应２１世纪需要
    据新华社日内瓦１月９日电  （记者李锐锋  施光耀）第４１届国际教育会议今天在日内瓦开幕。近１００个国家主管教育的高级官员、大学校长和研究人员出席会议，探讨中学后教育的现状和发展前景。
    联合国教科文组织总干事马约尔在会议开幕式上致词时说，中学后教育已成为解决各种问题、掌握科学技术和方法的一个必不可少的先决条件。
    马约尔在讲话中强调了中学后教育的重要性。他指出，一个国家的前途取决于它的知识水平，因此也取决于它的教师和知识分子。
    由联合国教科文组织召开的国际教育会议每两年在日内瓦举行一次，被认为是国际教育界的最高级会议。
    许多国家的教育部长参加了今年的会议。中国国务委员兼国家教委主任李铁映率领中国代表团出席。
    本届会议的主题是：“中学后教育与培训的政策和战略”。在为期９天的会议期间，各国代表还要就中学后教育的新趋势、适应就业的中学后教育的多样化等问题进行讨论。
    新华社日内瓦１月１０日电　率领中国教育代表团参加第４１届国际教育会议的中国国务委员兼国家教委主任李铁映今天在这里指出，中国政府致力于发展和改革中学后教育，力争建立一个能适应２１世纪中国经济、科技和社会发展所需要的新的教育体系，包括具有灵活结构和多样化的中学后教育。
    他说：“教育历来是一项神圣的事业，也是决定人类命运的一个重要领域。中国要改变目前经济、文化落后的面貌，在下世纪中叶达到中等发达国家的水平，根本出路在于提高劳动者的素质和培养适应经济和社会发展需要的大量合格人才，把我国丰富的人力资源转化为巨大的智力资源。”
    他说：“我国正在把发展和繁荣教育事业作为经济和社会发展的首要战略任务，并且着手研究制定面向２１世纪的教育发展战略。”
    他指出，中华人民共和国成立以来，特别是近１０年来，我国教育事业在改革中有了很大发展。
    他指出，可以说，我国已初步形成了多种层次、多种类型、多种形式、学科门类齐全、具有相当规模的中学后教育体系。
    他说：“中学后教育对经济建设、科技进步和社会发展起着巨大的促进作用，又必须为经济建设、科技进步和社会发展服务，使教育与经济互相促进、协调发展。”
    他说：“这是中国发展与改革中学后教育的基本指导思想。”
    李铁映还提到了中国政府为发展与改革中学后教育而制订的一系列政策。这些政策主要是：按照经济、科技和社会发展的实际需要，大力加强和发展社会需求大的学科，同时也注意保护和支持基础学科的发展；促进中学后教育模式的多样化；把提高教育质量作为中学后教育的中心环节；鼓励社会参与和支持中学后教育事业；扩大学校办学的自主权，减少政府对办学过程的行政干预。
    但是，李铁映也坦率地指出，目前中国中学后的教育体制还很不完善，各种层次的职业技术教育和培训还比较薄弱，课程设置、实践环节、教学内容和方法还不适应社会的需要，在品德教育和身体素质方面还存在不少问题。
