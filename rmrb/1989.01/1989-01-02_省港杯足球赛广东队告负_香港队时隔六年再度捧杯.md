Guangdong Team Loses in Provincial Cup; Hong Kong Team Wins After Six Years

	The Hong Kong team, in the second round of the 11th Provincial Cup football match, played exceptionally well, defeating the Guangdong team 4:2. The Hong Kong team, with a total score of 4:3 over two rounds, once again won the Provincial Cup, which they had not held for six years.

	Today's match was held at the Government Stadium. From the start, the Hong Kong team launched a fierce attack on the Guangdong team. The Guangdong team made several mistakes in passing and receiving the ball, and their defense line had gaps, leading to frequent dangers in front of their own goal. One minute before the end of the first half, Guangdong's Liao Youhua dribbled to the sideline and passed the ball in. In front of the goal, Wu Wenbing returned the ball to Wu Qunli at the edge of the penalty area. Wu Qunli shot and scored, making it 1:0 for Guangdong.

	After the break, the Guangdong team thought they had the upper hand and did not press the attack. However, the Hong Kong team, fighting for survival, launched an even stronger offensive. Three minutes into the second half, Hong Kong's number 18, Luo Weizhi, headed the ball past Guangdong's goalkeeper Ou Chuliang to equalize the score at 1:1. This goal boosted the morale of the Hong Kong players. At the 22nd minute, Hong Kong's number 8, Chen Fazhi, scored with a bicycle kick, making it 2:1 for Hong Kong. Just three minutes later, Hong Kong's Zhang Zhide successfully converted a penalty kick. In an attempt to reduce the deficit, the Guangdong team pushed forward, but their players were too eager and were caught off guard by Hong Kong, who scored again in the 37th minute through Babili. Three minutes before the end of the match, Guangdong's Mai Chao scored a penalty to reduce the deficit to 2:4, ultimately losing 2:4.

　　省港杯足球赛广东队告负
    香港队时隔六年再度捧杯
    本报香港１月１日电  香港队在第１１届省港杯足球赛第二回合比赛中超水平发挥，以４∶２击败广东队。香港队在两个回合比赛中以４∶３的总比分，再度捧得失落达６年之久的省港杯。
    今天的比赛是在政府大球场进行的。比赛一开始，香港队即向广东队猛攻，而广东队队员传接球失误较多，后防线出现漏洞，己方大门屡出险情。上半场结束前１分钟，广东队廖友华带球推进至底线附近，起脚传中，在门前的伍文兵把球回扣给在大禁区边角的吴群立，吴群立起脚抽射破网得分，广东队以１∶０领先。
    易边再战，广东队以为稳操胜券，抢截不积极。可背水一战的香港队却发动了更强大的攻势。开局３分钟，１８号罗伟志在门前头槌打破广东队欧楚良把守的城门，扳成１平。此球一进鼓舞了香港队员的士气。战至第２２分钟，８号陈发枝一记倒挂金钩，使香港队以２∶１超出。仅过３分钟，香港队张志德主罚点球成功。广东队为挽回劣势，全线压上反击，但队员打得急躁，反被香港队抓住战机，在第３７分钟由巴贝利再下一城。比赛结束前３分钟，广东队麦超罚点球追回１分，终以２∶４失利。
