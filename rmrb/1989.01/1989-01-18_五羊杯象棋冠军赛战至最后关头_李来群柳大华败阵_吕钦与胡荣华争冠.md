The Five Goats Cup Xiangqi Championship has reached its final stages. Li Laiqun and Liu Dahu have been defeated, leaving Lu Qin and Hu Ronghua to compete for the championship. Li Laiqun and Liu Dahu will now vie for the third place.

According to a report from Guangzhou on January 17th, Lu Qin from Guangdong and Hu Ronghua from Shanghai both won their rapid chess matches today, securing their spots in the finals of this year's Five Goats Cup Xiangqi Championship. Li Laiqun from Hebei and Liu Dahu from Hubei will now compete for the third place.

Li Laiqun, who had the advantage of playing first, chose to open with a side cannon and a horizontal chariot to gain the upper hand. Lu Qin responded with a reverse palace horse. By the mid-game, Li Laiqun had lost an elephant to Lu Qin. Li Laiqun then strategically moved his pieces to break Lu Qin's offensive and advanced his central soldier, trapping Lu Qin's horse. If Li Laiqun had exchanged his cannon for the horse, a draw was highly possible. However, unwilling to settle for a draw, Li Laiqun was ultimately defeated by Lu Qin's chariot, horse, two soldiers, two elephants, and a bare general, which took down Li Laiqun's chariot, cannon, two soldiers, two advisors, and elephant.

The match between Hu Ronghua and Liu Dahu was a tough battle within the time limit, with Hu Ronghua ultimately winning with a chariot and two soldiers against Liu Dahu's chariot and two advisors.

　　五羊杯象棋冠军赛战至最后关头
    李来群柳大华败阵  吕钦与胡荣华争冠
    本报广州１月１７日电  广东吕钦和上海胡荣华今天上午在快棋决战中，分别击败河北李来群和湖北的柳大华，取得本届五羊杯象棋冠军赛决赛资格，李来群和柳大华将争夺第３名。
    李来群猜先获得执红子先行，树起当头炮开横车局力争抢先，吕钦应以反宫马。至中局时，李来群被吕钦掠走一象。李来群调兵遣将瓦解了吕的攻势，并挺进中兵，困住吕一马。此势只要李来群以炮兑马，极可成和。但李不甘心言和，结果被吕钦车马双兵双象秃头帅杀死李来群的车炮双兵双士象。
    胡荣华与柳大华的交锋，在限步里苦战，最后胡以车双兵对柳车双士获胜。
