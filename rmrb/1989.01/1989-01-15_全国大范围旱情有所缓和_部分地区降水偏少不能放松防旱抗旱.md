	Nationwide drought conditions have eased somewhat. However, some regions have received less rainfall and must not relax their drought relief efforts.

	According to a report from our newspaper, since January 3rd, eastern China has experienced widespread rain and snow, alleviating the severe drought that had persisted over a large area in previous periods. Particularly in the central and southern regions, where the drought was most severe, significant rainfall has greatly eased the drought, benefiting the replanting, transplanting, and drought-resistant measures for autumn and winter crops.

	The areas where the drought-affected area has significantly reduced include Hubei, Hunan, Anhui, Zhejiang, Guangxi, Henan, Shaanxi, and Shandong provinces. However, in Jiangsu, Guizhou, Hebei, and Shanxi provinces, rainfall has been insufficient, and the drought has not eased. As of January 10th, the drought-affected area nationwide has been reduced by half compared to before the rain and snow.

	Due to insufficient rainfall during the flood season in some provinces last year, reservoirs and ponds have insufficient water storage, and the continuous drought in autumn and winter has led to increased water usage, which will bring difficulties to spring irrigation. Additionally, according to weather forecasts, rainfall in most parts of the country in January will still be below average. It is hoped that all regions will not relax their drought relief efforts.

　　全国大范围旱情有所缓和
    部分地区降水偏少不能放松防旱抗旱
    本报讯  元月３日以来，我国东部地区普降雨雪，使前段时期大范围持续干旱的严重局面有所缓和，特别是旱情较重的中南部大部分省区降雨较大，旱情大为缓解，对秋冬种作物的补苗、移栽和抗旱保苗十分有利。
    这次受旱面积减少较多的有鄂、湘、皖、浙、桂、豫、陕、鲁等省区；苏、黔、冀、晋等省降水少，旱情仍未缓解。截至元月１０日统计，全国受旱面积比雨雪前减少了一半。
    由于上年一些省区汛期雨水偏少，库塘蓄水不足，秋冬连旱又用水较多，将给春季灌溉用水带来困难，而且据气象预报，１月份全国大部地区降水仍然偏少，希望各地不能放松防旱抗旱工作。
