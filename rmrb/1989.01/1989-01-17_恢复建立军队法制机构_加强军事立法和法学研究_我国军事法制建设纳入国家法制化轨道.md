The construction of military legal systems in China has been integrated into the national legalization process. Major General Tu Men, Director of the Central Military Commission's Legal Bureau, introduced the progress of military legal construction since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Party in an interview with a reporter.

	— Military legal institutions have been restored and established. The military procuratorates and military courts at all levels of the entire army, which were completely destroyed by the Lin Biao and Jiang Qing counter-revolutionary cliques, have been gradually restored. Currently, there are 136 military procuratorates and military courts in the entire army. The Central Military Commission's Legal Bureau, which is responsible for military legal construction and military legislation, was also established in the second half of last year, forming a relatively complete judicial system from top to bottom. The entire army has cultivated a judicial team with good political and professional qualities, ensuring the effective functioning of judicial organs.

	— Military legislation has been strengthened. In the past 10 years, 106 military regulations have been issued. Among them, 5 military laws have been passed and promulgated by the National People's Congress and its Standing Committee, such as the "Law of the People's Republic of China on National Defense," "Regulations on Military Ranks of the Chinese People's Liberation Army," and "Regulations on the Service of Active-Duty Officers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army," etc.; 46 military regulations have been jointly issued by the State Council and the Central Military Commission, such as the "Regulations on Recruitment Work" and "Regulations on the Service of Active-Duty Soldiers," etc.; In addition, the Central Military Commission has also issued 55 military regulations. About 50% of the regulations currently in force in the military were promulgated or re-promulgated after 1979.

	— Military legal theory research has made breakthrough progress. In recent years, military legal research has begun to flourish, and the content of the research is developing towards comprehensiveness and systematicity. The first military legal theory monograph in China, "Chinese Military Law," has been published. Scholarly articles on military law have attracted the attention and recognition of China's legal, educational, and military communities. The State Education Commission has listed military law as a branch of China's legal discipline.

	— In-depth legal education has been carried out. Last year, the entire army basically completed the task of popularizing legal knowledge. Legal consultation service institutions have also been established in various large units, playing a role in safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of the army and soldiers.

	In addition, military judicial organs have done a lot of work in implementing policies, solving historical legacy issues, and combating serious criminal and economic crimes.

　　恢复建立军队法制机构　加强军事立法和法学研究
    我国军事法制建设纳入国家法制化轨道
    新华社北京１月１６日电  （记者易俭如）我国军事法制建设纳入国家法制化轨道。中央军委法制局局长图们少将在接受记者采访时，介绍了党的十一届三中全会以来军事法制建设的进展。
    ——恢复建立了军队法制机构，曾被林彪、江青反革命集团彻底砸烂的全军各级军事检察院、军事法院已陆续恢复。目前，全军已有军事检察院、军事法院１３６个，主管军队法制建设和军事立法工作的专门机构中央军委法制局也于去年下半年组建，从上到下形成了比较完整的司法工作系统。全军已培养出一支具有良好政治和业务素质的司法队伍，保证了司法机关职能作用的发挥。
    ——加强了军事立法，１０年来共颁布各种军事法规１０６个。其中，由全国人大及其常委会通过并颁布的军事法律５个，如《中华人民共和国兵役法》、《中国人民解放军军官军衔条例》、《中国人民解放军现役军官服役条例》等；由国务院和中央军委联合颁布的军事法规４６个，如《征兵工作条例》、《现役士兵服役条例》等；此外，中央军委还颁布了５５个军事法规。我军目前施行的法规中，约有５０％是１９７９年以后颁布或重新颁布的。
    ——军事法学理论研究获得突破性进展。近年来军事法研究开始勃兴，研究内容正向综合性、系统性方向发展，出版了我国第一部军事法学理论专著《中国军事法学》，有关军事法方面的学术论文，已引起我国法学界、教育界和军事学界的关注和重视，国家教委已将军事法学列为我国法学类的一门分支学科。
    ——深入开展法制教育。去年全军已基本完成普及法律常识的工作。遍及各大单位的法律咨询服务机构也相继成立，在维护军队和军人合法利益中发挥了作用。
    此外，军队司法机关还在落实政策，解决历史遗留问题和打击严重刑事犯罪、经济犯罪等方面做了大量工作。
