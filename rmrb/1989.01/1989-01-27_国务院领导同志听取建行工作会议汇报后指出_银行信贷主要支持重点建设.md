	Senior officials of the State Council, after listening to the report of the national work conference of the China Construction Bank, pointed out that it is impossible for all sectors of the national economy to develop simultaneously, and that industrial policies and credit policies should be "tilted" to form a "fist" to support the state's key construction projects in energy and transportation.

	Yesterday, leaders of the State Council responsible for construction, finance, and financial work, such as Zhou Jiahuai, Wang Bingqin, and Li Guixian, listened to the report of the national work conference of the China Construction Bank.

	At present, the work of cleaning up ongoing construction projects across the country has encountered various ideological obstacles and is progressing slowly. This is reflected in the fact that among the projects that have been decided to stop or delay, there are more non-production projects, and industrial projects have not been truly affected; there are more projects that are just clearing the site, acquiring land, and planning, and very few have actually started construction. Even among the projects that have been decided to stop or delay, some are still under construction.

	This year, the China Construction Bank faces a significant gap in credit funds and must ensure the construction loans for key construction projects arranged by the state's mandatory plans. Therefore, it must continue to vigorously organize deposits and strictly control loans.

	The State Council has explicitly stipulated that all self-raised construction funds and funds for the construction of buildings should be deposited in the China Construction Bank, stored in a special account, and subject to supervision. However, many units across the country are finding various excuses not to deposit the money in the China Construction Bank to avoid supervision and prefer to open accounts in other banks that offer "voluntary deposits and free withdrawals." According to incomplete statistics, only about 70% of the self-raised construction funds across the country are deposited in the China Construction Bank, and less than half of the funds for the construction of buildings are deposited for supervision by the China Construction Bank.

	In response to the current situation, senior officials of the State Council pointed out that bank work is closely related to economic construction. This year, banks should focus on increasing deposits, accelerating the recovery of loans, and speeding up the turnover of funds. In the future, further effective measures should be taken to control new construction projects. All new projects should be certified by the China Construction Bank to strengthen the supervision and management of various construction funds.

　　国务院领导同志听取建行工作会议汇报后指出    
    银行信贷主要支持重点建设
    本报讯  记者董焕亮、梅洪如报道：１月２６日，国务院领导同志指出，国民经济各部门不可能排成一排齐头并进，产业政策要“倾斜”，信贷政策也要“倾斜”，银行信贷要形成“拳头”，支持国家在能源、交通方面的重点建设。
    昨天，邹家华、王丙乾、李贵鲜等国务院负责基建、财政、金融工作的领导听取了全国建设银行工作会议的汇报。
    目前，全国清理在建项目的工作遇到种种思想阻力，进展缓慢。这表现在已经决定停建和缓建的工程中，非生产性项目多，工业项目还没有真正触及；搞“三通一平”、征地拆迁和进行规划的项目多，已经开工的项目很少，甚至决定停建和缓建的项目中个别的还在施工。
    今年，建设银行信贷资金缺口很大，又要保证国家指令性计划安排的重点建设基建贷款，因此必须继续大力组织存款，严格控制贷款。
    国务院曾明文规定把所有自筹基建资金和楼堂馆所建设资金存入建设银行，专户存储，接受监督。但是，各地现有不少单位寻找各种借口，不把钱存到建设银行来，以逃避监督，而宁愿在“存款自愿、取款自由”的其他银行开户。据不完全统计，全国自筹基建资金在建设银行开户的只有７０％左右，楼堂馆所资金交存建设银行监督的还不到一半。
    针对目前情况，国务院领导同志指出，银行工作和经济建设关系密切。今年，银行发展业务，要着重增加存款，加快收回贷款，加快资金周转。今后，要进一步采取有效措施，控制新开工项目，凡是新上项目，应当经过建设银行签证。以切实加强对各种建设资金的监督管理。
