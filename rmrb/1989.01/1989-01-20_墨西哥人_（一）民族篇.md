In the bustling corner of Cardenas Boulevard in Mexico City, there is a tranquil "Three Cultures" Square. The modern Foreign Ministry building stands like a giant overlooking a 16th-century Spanish-style church. Beside the ruins of the Aztec civilization, ancient trees cast their dense shadows over a pool of water surrounding a sparkling fountain. This symbolizes the three sources that make up Mexican civilization: indigenous Indian culture, European culture, and modern Mexican culture. Between the church and the ruins stands a stone monument with the following inscription: "On August 13, 1521, Tlatelolco, which had been bravely defended by Cuauhtémoc, fell into the hands of Hernán Cortés. This was not a victory or defeat for anyone, but the painful birth of a mixed-race nation, which is today's Mexico."

This inscription contains profound philosophy and a high degree of realism. Without understanding this, one cannot understand the Mexican people. From the above inscription, it can be seen that Mexicans do not consider the conquest of the indigenous people by the Spanish in the early 16th century as a failure or shame for anyone, nor as a victory or glory. If it were not for that period of history, there would be no Mexican nation today. After the Spanish conquered Mexico, the fusion of Europeans and local Indians gave birth to a new mixed-race nation known as "Mestizos." European civilization led Mexico out of its primitive, closed society and ushered in a new era.

However, what modern Mexicans take pride in is the indigenous Indian civilization created by the natives, which they call the Mexican national character. Painter Malfi is a typical example of an Indo-European mixed-race person. His great-grandfather was a wealthy European descendant, and his grandmother was an Indian. He told me, "I am proud of my Indian blood." Many people share this sense of identity. Therefore, this mixed-race nation has always carefully protected Indian culture and its precious heritage. Professor Huvencio of the National Autonomous University of Mexico explains that because Mexico was born out of an agricultural society, it has a strong peasant consciousness in its emotions, ideas, and habits, which is closer to Indian people and to developing agricultural countries in the East. In dealing with social relationships, Mexicans often follow traditions and practicality rather than being bound by principles. Therefore, people believe that Europeans have only occupied the physical form of this mixed-race nation, while Indians control the nation's thinking and emotions. Moreover, Mexicans believe that their ancestry comes from people who migrated to the American continent approximately 35,000 to 50,000 years ago through the Bering Strait from the East. It was these people, who later became the indigenous inhabitants of the American continent, who created the brilliant Indian civilization and the advanced agricultural society over the long years.

Mexico is a nation that values history and tradition. They do not feel inferior because their country's development lags behind that of their developed neighbor, the United States. The ancient Maya and Aztec civilizations created by the Indians, the independence war of the 18th century, the reforms and anti-French war of the 19th century, the bourgeois revolution of the early 20th century, and the nationalization of oil in the 1930s are all proud experiences of the Mexican people, which are continuously passed down to future generations and showcased to the world.

They use historical events and the birthdays of heroes to regulate national festivals, erect statues of heroes across the country, and name buildings and streets after heroes and important historical dates.

Even today, when foreigners come to Mexico, the first thing they feel is the strong national character of the Mexican people. The power of history has caused three distinct civilizations to collide and merge here, creating a nation that is both adventurous and rich in tradition, a nation with multiple cultures.

　　墨西哥人
    （一）民族篇
    本报记者  郭伟成
    墨西哥城喧闹的卡德纳斯大道一隅，有一个闹中取静的“三文化”广场。现代化的外交部大厦像巨人一样俯瞰着一座１６世纪的西班牙式教堂，破败而不失威严的阿兹特克遗址旁，古树把如盖的华荫，投在环绕着晶莹喷泉的一泓池水上。这就是寓意组成墨西哥文明的三个来源：印第安土著文化、欧洲文化和现代墨西哥文化。就在教堂与废墟之间，矗立着一块石碑，碑文是这样的：“１５２１年８月１３日，曾经被夸乌特莫克英勇捍卫着的特拉特洛尔科陷入埃尔南·科尔特斯之手。这不是任何人的胜利或失败，而是一个混血民族痛苦的诞生，这就是今天的墨西哥。”
    这碑文中包含着深刻哲理及高度的现实精神。不了解这一点，就不能了解墨西哥民族。从上述碑文可以看出，墨西哥人并不认为１６世纪初西班牙人对墨西哥土著人的征服是什么人的失败与耻辱或者胜利与光荣，因为如果没有那一段的历史，就不会有今天的墨西哥民族。西班牙人征服墨西哥后，由欧洲人与当地印第安人的结合而产生了一个全新的、被称作“梅斯蒂索”的混血民族。欧洲的文明使墨西哥走出了原始、封闭的社会状态，开始了一个崭新的时代。
    然而，现代墨西哥人引为自豪的，仍是土著人创造的印第安文明，并把这称作墨西哥的民族性。画家玛尔菲是典型的印欧混血种人。他的曾祖父是富有的欧洲后裔、祖母是印第安人。他对我说：“我为自己的印第安人血统感到自豪”。抱有这种认同感的不在少数。因此，这个混血民族一直小心翼翼地保护着印第安文化及其宝贵的遗产。墨西哥国立自治大学教授胡文西奥解释说，因为墨西哥脱胎于一个农业社会，在感情、观念与习惯上带有浓厚的农民意识，这更接近于印第安人，接近于东方的发展中的农业国家。在处理社会关系中，墨西哥人也往往是遵循传统、讲究实际、而不是拘泥于原则。因此，人们认为，欧洲人仅仅占领了这个混血民族的躯壳，而印第安人控制了这个民族的思维与情感。此外，墨西哥人认为其血缘来自大约３．５万年至５万年前通过白令海峡迁徙到美洲大陆的东方人。正是来自东方、后来成为美洲大陆土著居民的这些人们，在漫长的岁月里创造了灿烂的印第安文明、发达的农业社会。
    墨西哥是个重历史、重传统的民族。他们并不因为国家的发展落后于发达的邻国——美国而自卑。古代印第安人创造的玛雅与阿兹特克文明、１８世纪的独立战争、１９世纪的改革运动与反法战争、２０世纪初的资产阶级革命与３０年代的石油国有化运动，都是墨西哥人值得骄傲的经历，并不断地向后代传播、向世界展示。
    他们用历史事件、英雄诞辰，规定了国家的庆典，在全国各地竖立了英雄的塑像，用英雄的名字、重大历史事件的日期命名了建筑与街道。
    时至今日，当外域人来到墨西哥，他首先感受到的依然是墨西哥人强烈的民族性。历史的力量曾使三种截然不同的文明在这儿撞击，融合，创造了一个勇于开拓又富有传统的民族，一个具有多种文化的民族。
