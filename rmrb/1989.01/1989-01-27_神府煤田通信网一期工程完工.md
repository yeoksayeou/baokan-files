The communication line for this project is located within the jurisdiction of Shenmu County, Shaanxi Province. It starts from Daguliuta Township in the west and extends to Hujiagutai in the east, covering a total length of 69 kilometers. It serves as the main communication line for the operational management of the Baoshen Railway and is the first direct communication line from Beijing to the Shenfu Coal Field. The route is characterized by steep terrain and deep gullies, making the installation of equipment technically complex. The 17th Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways dispatched a skilled construction team, devised the optimal plan, and meticulously carried out the work. In just 70 days, they completed the task of setting up the communication network and installing equipment 17 days ahead of schedule. After inspection and acceptance by the construction and design units, the project was rated as an excellent quality project.

    神府煤田通信网一期工程完工
  　这段通信线路位于陕西省神木县境内，西起大柳塔乡，东至呼家圪台，全长六十九公里，是沟通包神铁路临管运营的通讯干线，也是北京直达神府煤田的第一条通信线路。沿途山势陡峻、沟壑纵横，设备安装技术比较复杂。铁道部第十七工程局抽出精干的施工队伍，拟定最佳方案，精心施工，仅用七十天，提前十七天，全部完成通信网架设和设备安装任务，经建设、设计单位检查验收，评定为优质工程。（唐世春）
