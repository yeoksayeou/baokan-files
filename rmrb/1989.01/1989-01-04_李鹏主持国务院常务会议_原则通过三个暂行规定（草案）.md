Li Peng Chaired the 31st State Council Executive Meeting

	New China News Agency, January 3, Beijing - Premier Li Peng presided over the 31st State Council Executive Meeting this morning, discussing and tentatively approving the drafts of the "Interim Provisions on the Investigation Procedures for Major Accidents," "Interim Provisions on the Management of Non-Scheduled Civil Aviation Transportation," and "Interim Provisions on Compensation for Bodily Injury to Passengers in Domestic Aviation Transportation."

	The "Interim Provisions on the Investigation Procedures for Major Accidents" is drafted to ensure the smooth investigation of major accidents. The regulations define major accidents as those causing severe casualties, significant economic losses, or having a serious nature and substantial impact. The draft provides detailed regulations on the protection and reporting of the accident scene, the investigation of major accidents, and penalties for such accidents.

	The "Interim Provisions on the Management of Non-Scheduled Civil Aviation Transportation" is drafted in response to the increasing number of foreign civil aviation enterprises flying into China in the form of chartered flights and the growing number of domestic chartered flights. This regulation aims to strengthen the management of non-scheduled flights by Chinese and foreign civil aviation aircraft within China's territory and between China and foreign countries, transporting passengers, luggage, cargo, and mail.

	The "Interim Provisions on Compensation for Bodily Injury to Passengers in Domestic Aviation Transportation" establishes the civil liability and compensation responsibility of domestic aviation transportation carriers for bodily injury to passengers within China. According to these provisions, the maximum compensation amount for each passenger that the carrier is responsible for is 20,000 yuan. These three regulations will be further revised by relevant departments and promulgated by the State Council for implementation.

　　李鹏主持国务院常务会议
    原则通过三个暂行规定（草案）
    新华社北京一月三日电  国务院总理李鹏今天上午主持召开了国务院第三十一次常务会议，讨论并原则通过了《特别重大事故调查程序暂行规定（草案）》、《不定期民用航空运输管理暂行规定（草案）》和《国内航空运输旅客身体损害赔偿暂行规定（草案）》。
    《特别重大事故调查程序暂行规定（草案）》是为了保证特别重大事故的调查工作顺利进行而制定的。规定中所称的特别重大事故是指造成特别重大人身伤亡或者巨大经济损失以及性质特别严重、产生重大影响的事故。《特别重大事故调查程序暂行规定（草案）》对特大事故的现场保护和报告、特大事故的调查、特大事故的罚则作了详细的规定。
    《不定期民用航空运输管理暂行规定（草案）》是针对近年来外国民用航空运输企业以包机形式飞入我国越来越多，国内不定期飞行的包机也日益增加的情况而制定的，以对在中国领域内及中国和外国之间从事运送旅客、行李、货物和邮件的中国和外国民用航空器的不定期飞行加强管理。
    《国内航空运输旅客身体损害赔偿暂行规定（草案）》确定了国内航空运输承运人在中国境内对旅客身体损害承担的民事责任和赔偿责任。按照本规定，应当承担赔偿责任的承运人对每名旅客的最高赔偿金额为人民币两万元。这三个规定由有关部门进一步修改后，由国务院发布施行。
