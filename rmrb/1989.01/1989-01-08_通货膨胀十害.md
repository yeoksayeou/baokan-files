The Ten Harms of Inflation

1. On Production: Due to the rise in raw material prices, enterprises face increased cost expenditures, affecting profits and even leading to losses. With continuous price increases, many enterprises and individual producers may engage in hoarding, speculation, and price hikes rather than improving technology, management, and economic efficiency.

2. On Distribution: Continuous price increases will inevitably lead to unfair distribution. Those involved in speculative activities can become wealthy, while workers relying on wages see their real income decrease as their income growth lags behind the price increases.

3. On Circulation: Continuous price increases and expectations of further rises will fuel speculative activities, with speculators running rampant. Both private and official speculators will cause the circulation sector to expand indefinitely, leading to soaring prices.

4. On Consumption: A few individuals who benefit from price increases can indulge in extravagant spending, while the majority of workers, facing reduced real income, will cut back on consumption. Price increases will alter consumption behavior, leading people to use savings to purchase goods, even hoarding items they don't immediately need.

5. On Investment: In a situation where prices are rising continuously and loan interest rates are lagging, borrowing from banks or issuing bonds for investment becomes highly profitable. Many low-efficiency investments will expand, leading to significant waste and exacerbating inflation.

6. On Foreign Trade: Continuous price increases without changes in the RMB exchange rate will affect both imports and exports. For exports, rising domestic procurement prices and exchange costs will lead to losses. For imports, goods purchased at the RMB exchange rate will yield huge profits when sold domestically, stimulating imports.

7. On Finance: Continuous price increases will reduce fiscal revenue. Fiscal expenditures will increase due to rising prices, putting significant pressure on the fiscal system.

8. On Finance (Banking): When the price increase rate exceeds the interest rate, resulting in negative interest rates, it disadvantages depositors while benefiting borrowers. Deposits will decrease, and loan demand will surge. Fiscal deficits and credit expansion will only increase money supply, fueling inflation.

9. On Education and Other Public Services: Even with annual budget increases, continuous price increases will lead to a continuous decrease in actual funds available for education and other public services.

10. On Price Reform: Under continuous price increases, price reform will face significant interference and serious consequences. Price reform will be subject to repeated starts and stops, causing people to lose confidence in it. In reality, under inflationary conditions, administrative price controls are ineffective.

### 通货膨胀十害

　　通货膨胀十害
    １．对生产——由于原材料涨价使企业的成本开支增加，影响了利润，甚至赔本。物价持续上涨，许多企业和个体生产者将从事囤积居奇、投机倒把、竞相提价而不去改进技术、改善管理和提高经济效益。
    ２．对分配——物价持续上涨，在分配上必然造成不公平。那些从事倒卖活动的人可以发财致富，而靠工资收入的职工则因收入的增长赶不上物价上涨速度而降低了实际收入。
    ３．对流通——物价持续上涨以及预期物价继涨，将使投机倒把活动猖獗，倒爷们到处横行。“私倒”加上“官倒”，使流通领域渠道和环节无限膨胀，物价飞涨。
    ４．对消费——因物价持续上涨而发财的少数人可以大肆挥霍，广大职工因实际收入下降而只能减少消费。物价上涨会改变人们的消费行为，出现动用储蓄来购买消费行为，甚至抢购目前并不需要的商品。
    ５．对投资——在物价持续上涨而贷款利率落后、出现负利率的情况下，向银行借款和发行债券来搞投资是非常有利的。许多经济效益差的投资因此得以扩大，造成很大浪费，加剧了通货膨胀。
    ６．对外贸——物价持续上涨而人民币的汇率不变，对进出口均有影响。对出口来说，国内收购价格不断上升、换汇成本不断提高，许多出口将发生亏损；对进口来说，按人民币汇率买进的商品在国内销售可得巨大盈利，将刺激进口。
    ７．对财政——物价持续上涨会减少财政收入。财政支出则因为物价持续上升而导致各项开支的增加，对财政造成很大的压力。
    ８．对金融——物价上涨率超过利率造成的负利率，对存款人不利而对借款人有利。因此存款会减少而借款的需求会猛增。财政赤字和信贷膨胀，只能增加货币发行，为通货膨胀火上加油。
    ９．对教育和其他公共事业——即使经费年年增加，但由于物价持续上涨，实际经费会不断下降。
    １０．对价格改革——在物价持续上涨的条件下，价格改革会受到巨大干扰，带来严重后果。价格改革不得不放放管管、走走停停。这将使人们丧失对价格改革的信心，实际上在通货膨胀的条件下，靠行政命令去管制物价是管不住的。
