	The city of Dayong in Hunan Province, famous for the Zhangjiajie Scenic Area within its borders, has seen the construction of numerous two-story villas along the banks of the Li River and at the foot of the Ziyu Mountain over the past few years. Many of these villas are private residences built by local officials. According to materials provided by the city's Land and Resources Bureau, since 1983, this county-level city has had 53 county-level and division-level officials, 162 bureau-level officials, and many other officials build private residences. The city's Party Secretary told reporters that "out of the ten members of the Municipal Party Committee, only one has not been involved."

	Dayong City is classified as a "poor, remote, and underdeveloped" area, but reporters have seen that the standards of the private residences built by officials are not low: the two-story villas generally have polished stone floors, ceramic skirting, and walls covered with whitewash. The private residence of the Director of the Municipal Government Office, Gong Shijie, consists of four suites with four bedrooms and one living room. According to Gong Shijie's family members, this is not even the most extravagant in Dayong City. The Western-style villa built by Yu Guanghao, the Director of the Zhangjiajie Forest Park Management Office, has a roof made of reddish-brown tiles and walls covered with colored ceramic tiles. According to the construction workers, the interior is covered with parquet flooring.

	The person in charge of the recently established Dayong Work Committee, which is being formed to promote the city to a prefecture-level city, told reporters: "The construction of private houses by officials in Dayong City involves many illegal methods, and public opinion is strongly against it. The impact is very bad, and it is a testament to the use of power for personal gain."

	It is interesting to investigate how the land, materials, and funds for the construction of private houses by officials in Dayong City were obtained.

	According to statistics from the Dayong City Land and Resources Bureau, since 1983, the city, including various levels of officials, has occupied a total of 789 mu of land for the construction of private residences, of which 647 mu are arable land such as paddy fields, orchards, and vegetable gardens, accounting for 82%. By 1986, out of the 1,679 households in the city that built houses, including 850 official households, 1,494 households had building land that was either approved in small amounts but occupied in large amounts, built without approval, or approved in one place but built in another.

	Materials provided by the Municipal Planning Commission indicate that in 1988 alone, out of the 94 tons of steel allocated by higher authorities and transferred from other units for the expansion of factories and the construction of school buildings, 72 tons were purchased by 144 people to build private residences. According to the reporter's investigation, the vast majority of these 144 people are officials or their family members. Municipal Party Secretary Liu Guoji told reporters that he had purchased 3 tons of steel at the planned price to build his residence.

	During the fourth quarter of last year, the Standing Committee of the Hunan Provincial People's Congress inspected the implementation of laws and regulations such as the "Forest Law" and the "Land Law" throughout the province. It was found that from July 1987 to August of last year, 554 officials in Dayong City purchased 3,386 cubic meters of timber from forest farms at a low price of 128 to 220 yuan per cubic meter to build houses.

	From 1983 to the end of last year, four specialized banks and credit unions in Dayong City issued a total of more than 4 million yuan in housing loans in the urban area. Most of the recipients of these housing loans were officials. During the reporter's investigation in December of last year, it was found that the amount of overdue and unpaid loans was 126 million yuan. At the same time, local staff of the Agricultural Bank told reporters that Dayong issued several million yuan in IOUs for the purchase of agricultural products last year, and the 400,000 jin of rice seeds urgently needed this year are also facing difficulties in procurement due to a lack of funds.

	Due to the strong public reaction to officials building private houses, Dayong City established an "Office for the Investigation of Private Houses" last November. During the investigation, this office discovered that 18 bureau-level officials had resold houses, and the director of the Light Industry Machinery Factory, Wang Guozhi, had built and sold houses twice, making a net profit of 110,000 yuan.

	Recently, the Hunan Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission sent a letter to the Dayong Work Committee, requiring a serious investigation and handling of the problems existing in the construction of private houses by officials in Dayong City.

### 大庸干部建私房成风  以权谋私群众意见大

　　大庸干部建私房成风  以权谋私群众意见大
    据新华社长沙一月二十六日电（记者刘敏、刘金桐）因境内有张家界风景区而闻名的湖南省大庸市，在绕市区而过的澧水河边和傍城逶迤的紫舞山下，近些年出现了一片片漂亮的两层小楼群。这些小楼有许多是当地干部盖的私人住宅。据市国土局提供的材料，一九八三年以来这个县级市有五十三名县团级干部、一百六十二名科局级干部和许多一般干部盖了私人住宅。市委书记告诉记者，盖私人住宅“市委十名常委中只有一人未‘沾边’。”
    大庸市属“老少边穷”地区，但记者在这里看到，干部们建的私宅标准却不低：两层小楼一般都是水磨石地面，瓷砖护脚，水刷石敷墙。市政府办公室主任龚世界的私宅是四套四室一厅，而据龚世界的家属说，这在大庸市还不算拔尖的。张家界森林公园管理处处长喻光浩建起的西式小楼，房顶是栗色勾瓦，外墙敷彩色瓷砖，据施工人员说，室内是拼花木板铺地。
    为筹建地级市而于新近组建的中共大庸工作委员会负责人对记者说：“大庸市干部建私房，歪门邪道多，群众意见大，影响非常坏，是以权谋私的见证。”
    考察一下大庸市干部建私房的土地、材料和资金从何而来是很有意思的。
    据大庸市国土局统计，一九八三年以来大庸市区包括各级干部在内，因建私人住宅共占地七百八十九亩，其中六百四十七亩为水田、果园、菜地等耕地，占百分之八十二。到一九八六年，在全市包括八百五十户干部在内的一千六百七十九户建房户中，有一千四百九十四户的建房用地属少批多占、不批就建和东批西建。
    市计委提供的材料表明，仅一九八八年大庸市为扩建工厂、建设校舍等向上级申请和由外单位转拨的九十四吨钢材中，有七十二吨被一百四十四人买走盖了私人住宅。据记者核查，这一百四十四人中绝大多数是干部或干部家属。市委书记刘国基向记者谈到，他就按计划内价格买了三吨钢材盖住宅。
    湖南省人大常委会去年第四季度在全省检查《森林法》、《土地法》等法律法规的执行情况时发现，从一九八七年七月至去年八月，大庸市有五百五十四名干部以每立方米一百二十八元至二百二十元的低价从林场购买建房木材三千三百八十六立方米。
    从一九八三年至去年底，大庸市四家专业银行和信用社在城区共向私人发放建房贷款余额共四百多万元。得到建房贷款的多数是干部。记者去年十二月到这里调查时，到期和逾期未还的贷款数为一百二十六万元。同时，当地农业银行的人员对记者说，大庸去年收购农产品给农民打了几万元的白条子，今年急需的四十万斤稻种也因缺乏资金，调运困难。
    由于群众对干部盖私房反应强烈，大庸市于去年十一月成立了一个“清查私房办公室”。这个办公室在清查中发现，有十八名科局级干部倒卖房屋，轻工机械厂厂长王国治建两次卖一次，净赚一点一万元。
    最近，湖南省纪检会发函给大庸工委，要求认真查处大庸市干部建私房中存在的问题。
