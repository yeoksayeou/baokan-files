Microwave ovens and induction cooktops are becoming the new "hot spots" in household appliances for 1989. These two types of household appliances, which only appeared in China in the past two years, had a production volume of 100,000 units for induction cooktops and 60,000 units for microwave ovens in 1988. Judging from the production plans for various places in 1989, induction cooktops will reach 1,270,000 units, and microwave ovens will reach 380,000 units.

Hot products are being rushed into production, with repeated introductions and widespread setup, a phenomenon that was very prominent in the development of the first generation of home appliances. Relevant parties have repeatedly appealed to learn from the lessons and not to repeat the same mistakes. However, judging from the current development trend, induction cooktops and microwave ovens, like the previous generation of home appliances, are high-tech and high-value-added products. Various regions and departments are competing to produce them, and with multiple management and investment channels, the number of factories producing induction cooktops nationwide has reached more than 200 in just two or three years, and there are dozens of microwave oven factories, with dozens more preparing to invest and start production. To get started quickly, everyone is importing from multiple sources and doing their own thing, and repeated introductions have reappeared.

Overheated production will induce consumer heat. However, these two products, which currently rely on a large number of imported components, are not suitable for large-scale promotion in China. According to investigations, key components needed for the production of these two products, such as continuous microwave magnetrons, high-power high-reverse-voltage transistors, and ceramic microcrystalline glass panels, still need to be imported, which will consume a large amount of foreign exchange. Additionally, China's current power supply is limited, and a large number of products entering the market will exacerbate the power shortage.

Experts call for strengthening macro-control over the production and development of microwave ovens and induction cooktops, and proceeding in stages and steps. Concentrate efforts on solving the problem of domestic production of product raw materials and key components, stabilize product quality, and focus on exports. It is necessary to cool down the overheated production and put this high-tech product on a healthy development track.

　　微波炉电磁灶生产应该降温
    本报记者  刘桂莲
    微波炉、电磁灶，正在成为１９８９年家用电器上马的新“热点”。近两年才在我国出现的这两种家用电器，１９８８年的产量为电磁灶１０万台，微波炉６万台。从各地１９８９年的计划数字看，电磁灶将发展到１２７万台，微波炉３８万台。　　
    热门产品一哄而上，重复引进、四处铺摊子，这种现象，在第一代家电产品发展中就很突出。有关方面多次呼吁，要吸取教训，不要重蹈覆辙。可是，从目前发展势头看，电磁灶、微波炉和上一代家电一样，由于同属高技术、高附加值，各地、各部门都争先恐后地上，加上多口管理、多渠道投资，二三年之间，全国生产电磁灶的厂家已达２００多家，微波炉厂也有几十家，各地还有几十家准备投资上马。为了上得快，都在多头对外、各搞各的，重复引进再度出现。
    生产过热会诱发消费热。可是，目前靠大量进口零部件支撑的这两种产品，不适合在国内大力推广。据调查，生产这两种产品需要的关键零部件，如连续微波磁控管、大功率高反压晶体管、陶瓷微晶玻璃板等都还必须依靠进口，这要花去大量外汇。另外，我国目前电力有限，产品大量进入市场，必将加剧电力紧张。
    专家们呼吁，微波炉、电磁灶的生产和发展，应加强宏观控制，分阶段、分步骤地进行。集中力量解决产品原材料和关键件的国产化问题，稳定产品质量，以出口为主，要给过热的生产降降温，使这种高技术产品走上健康发展轨道。
