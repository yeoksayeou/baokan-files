    Long County Establishes a Civil Foundation to Increase Agricultural Investment
    Shaanxi Province Promotes This Reform Experience Across the Province

    Xian, January 31 (People's Daily) -- Facing the difficulties of insufficient rural funds and stagnant grain production, the Long County Party Committee and the county government have explored a new mechanism for agricultural investment, paving a path of self-accumulation, self-regulation, and self-development. Over the past three years, approximately 85% of the total villages in the county have established cooperative foundations, accumulating a total of 10.303 million yuan in cooperative funds, with circulating funds exceeding half of the county's agricultural loans over the past two years. According to statistics, 4.185 million yuan of this civilian capital has been invested in agricultural production, playing a role in strengthening the agricultural sector. Last year, the county's total grain production reached a historic high, and farmers' per capita net income exceeded 400 yuan for the first time.

    Long County is a mountainous agricultural county with irrigated land accounting for only 1/7 of the cultivated area. With the development of the rural commodity economy, most households have escaped poverty and become prosperous, and new houses are being built one after another. However, agricultural investment has significantly decreased, and many irrigation facilities have aged. To change this situation, the county Party Committee and the county government decided to explore a new mechanism for agricultural investment.

    Starting in 1985, the entire county first established cooperative foundations at the village level. Then, these collective accumulations were converted into shares for each household. For collective houses, agricultural machinery, irrigation facilities, and other fixed assets, they were considered "fixed share capital"; cash, deposits, and outstanding loans were considered "circulating share capital." These two types of capital were allocated to each household based on labor, with resources calculated per household, and "share capital certificates" were issued. It was stipulated that these two types of capital still belonged to the public funds of the rural cooperative economy and could not be withdrawn or redistributed. Among them, the "circulating share capital" could earn interest and dividends.

    In the management of funds, the rural cooperative foundation adheres to the principles of cooperation and compensation, with the service objects being the village's households and household-operated, village-operated, and jointly-operated enterprises. The "fixed share capital" in the cooperative funds is used according to different situations. For example, irrigation facilities are still managed or contracted by the collective, and collective houses are used or leased by village-operated enterprises and jointly-operated enterprises and specialized households. The foundation annually collects depreciation fees or rent from the users. The "fixed share capital" does not pay dividends or earn interest. The "circulating share capital" is used in a compensated interest-bearing manner. The circulating share capital allocated according to the members' shares and the newly invested capital are paid corresponding interest by the foundation, referring to the interest rate of the credit cooperative. Members using the foundation's funds enjoy preferential interest rates.

    By the end of last year, the cooperative foundations in various villages had cumulatively invested 4.185 million yuan in 7,132 households and 99 village-operated and jointly-operated enterprises. Last year, in the face of a tight supply of fertilizers, the county's rural areas raised 4.4 million yuan through the cooperative foundation and invested in the Baoji County Que Town Nitrogen Fertilizer Factory. According to the contract, the factory provided 8,800 tons of fertilizers at the planned price to the investing village groups, easing the shortage of fertilizers.

    The Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Government have promoted the experience of establishing rural cooperative foundations in Long County across the province.

　　陇县建立民间基金会增加农业投入    
    陕西已向全省推广这一改革经验
    本报西安电  面对农村资金短缺、粮食生产徘徊的难题，陕西省陇县县委和县政府，通过探求农业投入新机制，走出一条自我积累、自我调控、自我发展的路子。近３年多来，约占全县总村数８５％的村建立了合作基金会，共有合作基金１０３０．３万元，其中流动基金超过近两年全县农业贷款的一半。据统计，这笔民间资金已有４１８．５万元投入农业生产，起到了为农业增强后劲的作用。去年全县粮食总产创历史最高水平，农民人均纯收入首次突破４００元。
    陇县是一个山区农业县，水浇地仅占耕地面积的１／７多。随着农村商品经济的发展，大多数农户脱贫致富，新建房一座连一座，农业投资却大幅度减少，不少水利设施老化。为改变这种状况，县委、县政府决定探求农业投入的新机制。
    从１９８５年开始，全县首先在村一级建立了合作基金会。然后将这些集体积累折股到户。对集体房屋、农机具、水利设施等固定资产，作为“固定股金”；现金、存款和尚未收回的欠款，作为“流动股金”。这两种资金分别按各户的劳力，以工带资计算到户，发给“股金指标证”。并规定，这两种股金仍属农村合作经济的公有基金，不能抽回，不得平调，其中“流动股金”可以计息和分红。
    农村基金会在资金管理中坚持合作和有偿的原则，服务对象是本村的农户和户办、村办、联办企业。合作资金中的“固定股金”，根据不同情况投入使用。如水利设施仍由集体掌握或承包管理，集体房屋因由村办企业使用或租赁给联办企业和专业户使用，基金会每年向使用者提取折旧费或租金。“固定股金”不分红、不计息。“流动股金”则以有偿计息的办法投入使用。按会员折算的流动股金指标和新投入的股金，由基金会参照信用社的利率，付给相应的利息。会员使用基金会的资金，利息优惠。
    截至去年年底，各村的合作基金会已向７１３２户和９９个村办、联办企业，累计投放资金４１８．５万元。去年，在化肥供应紧张的情况下，全县农村通过合作基金会集资４４万元，向宝鸡县虢镇氮肥厂投股。按合同规定，厂方为投股村组提供平价化肥８８００吨，缓解了化肥紧缺的局面。
    陕西省委、省人民政府向全省推广了陇县兴办农村合作基金会的经验。
