Côte d'Ivoire's 1987-1988 agricultural year has come to an end. Due to favorable weather conditions, the production of cocoa and coffee will remain at the same level as the previous year. However, the bumper harvest has not brought the expected joy. This is because the international market prices of these two agricultural products have dropped to their lowest historical levels, causing significant losses for Côte d'Ivoire.

It is said that one can feel the pulse of Côte d'Ivoire's economy by looking at the prices of cocoa and coffee beans in the markets of London, Paris, and New York. This is not an exaggeration. The country's dependence on these two export products is too great. In recent years, the production of cocoa and coffee has remained at levels of 500,000 tons and 300,000 tons respectively. The income from these two crops accounts for 18% of the national GDP and more than half of the total export earnings. However, since the 1980s, especially since 1987, the prices of cocoa and coffee on the international market have been falling, even dropping below the cost price. The more they export, the greater the losses. Over the past three years, Côte d'Ivoire has suffered losses amounting to 600 billion CFA francs (approximately $2 billion), which is a significant burden for a small country. The severe economic situation prompted the government of Côte d'Ivoire to formulate a new plan to revitalize agriculture at the end of 1987, adjusting its agricultural development strategy accordingly. The main contents are as follows:

First, continue to promote agricultural diversification to reduce dependence on cocoa and coffee. Focus on developing rice and corn as the main grain crops, aiming to achieve self-sufficiency in major grains by the year 2000. In the mid-1970s, Côte d'Ivoire once achieved rice self-sufficiency, but since 1978, it has had to import tens of thousands of tons of rice each year. This alone requires spending hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign exchange, in addition to importing large quantities of other grains and fish, meat, milk, and eggs. The new development plan places rice and corn production in a top priority position. It is planned to plant 28,000 hectares of irrigated rice, 238,000 hectares of rain-fed rice, and 180,000 hectares of corn in the next agricultural year. It is expected that in the next three years, 1.6 million tons of rice and 300,000 tons of corn will be produced. By the year 2000, 1.2 million tons of white rice will be produced annually, basically achieving rice self-sufficiency. To encourage farmers to grow grains, rice seeds, fertilizers, and corn seeds will be provided free of charge for the next two years. The planting area for cocoa and coffee will not be expanded, focusing instead on renewing old trees, eliminating inferior trees, improving production and quality, and maintaining the current level of exports. At the same time, cotton, oil palms, coconuts, rubber, tropical fruits, and vegetables will be developed, aiming to make rubber production the first in Africa by 1990.

Second, establish agricultural-industrial cooperatives to develop agricultural processing industries, gradually realizing the integration of production, processing, and sales. After independence, Côte d'Ivoire established its own agricultural processing industry, possessing good infrastructure and technical strength. The new plan proposes, based on fully utilizing existing processing capabilities, to further expand new processing departments. According to a new investment law, the government of Côte d'Ivoire encourages domestic private capital to build small and medium-sized agricultural processing plants and attracts foreign investment with more favorable conditions. The Ministry of Agriculture has established the Agricultural Processing Bureau, which is specifically responsible for this work. This will not only partially meet the food needs of the local people, reduce imports, but also increase the export of processed products.

Third, encourage young people to return to the countryside to farm, adding new vitality to agriculture, and vigorously promote agricultural technology, popularizing mechanized farming. Côte d'Ivoire faces a severe shortage of agricultural labor and an aging farming population, with 90% of farmers over 35 years old, and most still using traditional farming methods. Obviously, this is not suitable for modern agricultural production. The government has made mobilizing young people to return to the countryside a pressing task. According to incomplete statistics, in the next few years, more than 50,000 young people will return to the countryside to farm, with 2,000 this year and 5,000 each subsequent year. These young people will first go to training centers to learn agricultural technology and then form cooperative organizations to engage in agricultural production on land allocated by the state. The state will provide support in terms of funds, technology, agricultural machinery, and other production materials.

Currently, Côte d'Ivoire has mobilized the entire nation to strive for overcoming difficulties, revitalizing agriculture, and achieving new development goals.

### 科特迪瓦调整农业发展战略

　　科特迪瓦调整农业发展战略
    本报记者  杨汝生
    科特迪瓦１９８７—１９８８农业年度已经结束，由于风调雨顺，可可和咖啡的产量将与上年度持平。然而，丰收并没有给人们带来应有的喜悦。因为这两种农产品的国际市场价格已经跌到历史上的最低水平，给科特迪瓦带来很大的损失。
    人们说，从伦敦、巴黎、纽约市场上可可豆和咖啡豆的价格可以触摸到科特迪瓦经济的脉搏。此话不假。因为它对这两种出口产品的依赖性太大了。近年来，可可和咖啡的产量均保持在５０万吨和３０万吨的水平上。这两种作物的收入就占了国民生产总值的１８％，占了出口总收入的一半以上。然而，８０年代以来，尤其是自１９８７年以来，国际市场上可可和咖啡的价格轮番下跌，甚至低于成本价格，出口越多，损失越大，３年间，科特迪瓦遭受的损失高达６０００亿西非法郎（约合２０亿美元），这给一个小国造成的困难可想而知。严峻的经济形势促使科政府于１９８７年年底制定了振兴农业的新规划，对其农业发展战略进行必要的调整，其主要内容如下：
    一、继续推广农产品多样化，以减少对可可、咖啡的依赖，大力发展以稻谷、玉米为中心的粮食作物，力争２０００年实现主要粮食自给。在７０年代中期，科一度做到大米自给，但自１９７８年以后，每年都要进口几十万吨大米，只此一项就要花费上亿美元的外汇，另外还需进口大量其他粮食和鱼、肉、奶、蛋等。新的发展计划把稻谷、玉米的生产放在头等重要的位置。拟在下一个农业年度种植２．８万公顷水稻，２３．８万公顷旱稻，１８万公顷玉米。预计在今后的３年间生产稻谷１６０万吨，玉米３００万吨，到２０００年每年产白米１２０万吨，基本上做到大米自给。为了鼓励农民种粮，今后两年免费提供稻种、肥料和玉米种子。可可、咖啡不再扩大种植面积，重点放在更新老树、淘汰劣树、提高产量和质量，维持现有的出口水平。同时发展棉花、油棕、椰子、橡胶、热带水果和蔬菜等，力争橡胶产量１９９０年达到非洲第一。
    二、建立农—工联合体，发展农产品加工工业，逐步实现生产、加工、销售的一体化。科特迪瓦独立后，建立了自己的农产品加工工业，具备较好的基础设施和技术力量。新的规划提出在充分发挥现有加工能力的基础上，准备进一步扩建新的加工部门。根据一项新的投资法，科政府鼓励本国私人资本兴建中小型农产品加工厂，并以更多的优惠条件吸引外国投资。农业部成立了农产品加工局，具体负责这方面的工作。这既可部分满足本国人民的食品需要，减少进口，又可增加制成品的出口。
    三、鼓励青年返乡务农，为农业增添新的活力，大力普及农业技术，推广机械化耕作。科特迪瓦农业劳动力短缺和农民老化的现象十分严重，９０％的农民都超过３５岁，且多采用传统方式耕作。显然，这与现代化的农业生产很不适应。科政府已把动员青年返乡作为一项紧迫的任务来抓。据不完全统计，在今后的几年内，将有５万多名青年回乡务农，今年先安置２０００，以后每年安置５０００。这些青年将先到培训中心学习农业技术，然后结成合作组织，到国家分配的土地上从事农业生产。国家在资金、技术、农业机械和其他生产资料方面将给予支持。
    当前，科特迪瓦已全国动员起来，为闯过难关、振兴农业、实现新的发展目标而努力奋斗。
