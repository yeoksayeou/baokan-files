    Tang Anzhong, a teacher from the Political Science Department at Shandong Normal University, stated at a theoretical seminar: Any significant social reform cannot be achieved in one giant leap. It must have intermediate transitional stages as relay points. Its movement law is not one of continuous advancement, but rather advancement—rectification—advancement again—rectification again. It is not a complete halt, but rather an adjustment of the internal relationships that become uncoordinated after rapid movement, allowing the laggards to catch up, so that each link and each part can start from a more uniform starting point to advance again.

　　汤安中谈
    社会改革运动规律
    山东师范大学政治系教师汤安中在一次理论研讨会上说：任何大的社会改革，都不能采取一步到位的大跨跃，都要有中间过渡态作为中转站。它的运动规律，不是不断挺进，而是挺进——整顿——再挺进——再整顿。并不是完全停止，而是调整急速运动后出现的内部关系中的不协调，使后进者赶上，以利各环节、各局部在较接近一致的起跑点上再前进。
