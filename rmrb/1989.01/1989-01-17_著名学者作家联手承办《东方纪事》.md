A high-end cultural magazine, co-hosted by a group of renowned writers and scholars, has garnered praise from several generations of cultural figures today.

The magazine, titled "Dongfang Ji Shi," will launch new columns such as "Dongfang Xianhua," "Xin Rulin," "Ganwutoyuansheng," and "Dongxi Feng" after its revamp this year, each hosted by Liu Xinwu, Liu Zaifu, and others respectively.

It is understood that the magazine, which currently has a circulation of over 20,000 copies, loses over 10,000 yuan per issue. Despite this, the publisher, Jiangsu Literature and Art Publishing House director Cai Yushan, stated: It will not lower the quality of its articles for the sake of a broader readership, nor will it compromise the magazine's pursuit and original intent for higher circulation numbers.

　　著名学者作家联手承办《东方纪事》
    本报北京一月十六日讯  由一批著名作家和学者作为专栏主持人的一份高档文化刊物，今天在此间赢得几代文化人的喝采。
    这份刊物取名《东方纪事》，今年改刊后推出“东方闲话”、“新儒林”、“感悟与人生”、“东西风”等专栏，分别由刘心武、刘再复等主持。
    据了解，这份目前发行两万多份的刊物每期要赔款一万多元。尽管如此，刊物的主办者江苏文艺出版社负责人蔡玉洗仍表示：它不会为读者层次的宽窄而降低文章的格调，也不为刊物发行量的多少而改变刊物的追求和初衷。
