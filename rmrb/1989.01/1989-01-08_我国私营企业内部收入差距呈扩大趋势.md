Over the past few years, the existence and development of employment relationships in China have shown that the dominant public ownership of the means of production cannot fundamentally intervene in the distribution pattern within private enterprises. Due to the accelerated expansion of private enterprises, the number of hired workers is increasing, and the accumulation of private assets and income growth of enterprise owners are relatively fast. The income of salaried employees, however, is determined by the overall economic development level of the country, and the wages of hired workers are constrained by the average wage level in society, so their growth rate cannot be fast. Comparatively, the income gap between enterprise owners and hired workers, salaried employees will continue to widen. According to a typical survey in Baoji and Jinyang counties in Shaanxi Province, the income gap between enterprise owners and workers was 19 times in 1982, 21.3 times in 1984, and 31.4 times in 1986. The income level of hired workers in the coastal regions of Southeast China is relatively high, but the income level of enterprise owners is even higher. In Kaiping County, Guangdong Province, there is a millionaire whose net income in 1986 was 321,000 yuan, which is 178 times the average annual wage of 1,800 yuan for hired workers in the enterprise. The income of enterprise owners is positively correlated with the scale of the enterprise and the number of hired workers; the more hired workers there are, the greater the income gap with the hired workers. National rural socio-economic survey data show that the income gap between enterprise owners and hired workers in enterprises with fewer than 7 hired workers is 7.1 times; the gap is 13.3 times for enterprises with 8 or more hired workers. In the current stage where the national population is generally not very wealthy, excessively large income gaps in some regions have already exceeded people's psychological tolerance, triggering some new social problems. Encouraging the development of the private economy essentially acknowledges the legalization of such income gaps, but it does not encourage their continued widening. This requires us to use economic, legal, and administrative means to regulate the high incomes of enterprise owners: curb their excessive consumption, encourage them to invest in expanding production, and form and develop social productive capacity.

### 我国私营企业内部收入差距呈扩大趋势

　　我国私营企业内部收入差距呈扩大趋势
    几年来，雇佣劳动关系在我国存在和发展表明，占主导地位的生产资料公有制并不能从根本上干预私营企业内部的分配格局。由于私营企业呈加速度规模扩大，雇工人数呈增加趋势，企业主私有资产积聚和收入增长的速度比较快。而工薪人员的收入则由整个国家经济发展水平所决定，雇工工资又受社会平均工资水平所制约，因此增长速度不可能很快。比较而言，企业主与雇工、工薪人员的收入差距将呈继续扩大的趋势。据陕西省宝鸡、泾阳等县的典型调查，企业主与工人的收入差距，１９８２年为１９倍，１９８４年为２１．３倍，１９８６年为３１．４倍。东南沿海地区雇工的收入水平较高，但企业主的收入水平更高。广东省开平县有一位百万富翁，１９８６年纯收入３２．１万元，是该企业雇工年平均工资１８００元的１７８倍。企业主收入与企业规模、雇工人数成正相关关系，雇工人数越多，与雇工的收入差距越大。全国农村社会经济调查资料表明，雇工７人以下的企业主与雇工的收入差距为７．１倍；雇工８人以上的差距为１３．３倍。在全国人民普遍不太富裕的现阶段，过份悬殊的收入差距，在一些地区已经超过人们的心理承受能力，诱发出一些新的社会问题。鼓励私营经济发展，实质上是承认这种收入差距的合法化，但不是鼓励它继续扩大。它要求我们运用经济的、法律的、行政的手段，对企业主的高收入进行调节：抑制其过高的生活消费，鼓励其投入扩大再生产，形成并发展社会生产能力。
