In recent years, the suburban areas of Fuzhou City in Fujian Province have utilized idle lands such as barren hills to build parks and other recreational facilities, attracting urban residents to visit the countryside. This not only changes the past situation where rural residents went to the city to watch movies and visit parks but also increases income for local farmers.

Currently, the suburban areas of Fuzhou City have established 5 parks, 13 movie theaters, and a number of amusement parks, swimming pools, and roller skating rinks. Most of these entertainment venues are located in the urban-rural fringe areas, featuring small size, convenience, and low cost, thus attracting many urban residents to visit. It is estimated that approximately 100,000 people visit these venues daily.

On a sunny Sunday after a rain, the reporter visited the newly built Ping Shan Farmers' Park. Just two years ago, this place was a garbage hill, but now it has been transformed into a brand new park. A manager at Ping Shan Park told the reporter that the villagers of Quan Tang Village collectively invested 600 million yuan to build this park and swimming pool. In the future, they will continue to improve the park's greenery and add more recreational facilities to make the park even better.

　　昔日乡下人进城娱乐　如今城里人下乡游玩    
    福州市郊农民兴办娱乐场所
    据新华社福州１月２８日电（记者王凡凡）近年来，福建省福州市郊区农村利用荒山等闲散地兴建公园等游乐场所，吸引城里人到乡下游玩。这不仅改变了过去乡下人进城看电影、逛公园的状况，也为当地农民增加了收入。
    目前，福州市郊区已先后办起５座公园、１３个影剧院以及一批游乐场、游泳池、旱冰场等游乐场所。这些娱乐场所大部分建在城乡结合部，具有小型、方便、费用低等优点，因而吸引了不少城市居民前来游玩。据估算，每天光临这些场所的游客约有１０万多人次。
    在雨过天晴的一个星期日，记者来到新建的屏山农民公园。这里前两年还是一座垃圾山，现在却被改造得焕然一新。屏山公园的一位管理人员告诉记者，他们泉塘村村民共集资６００万元兴建起这座公园和游泳池。今后，他们将继续搞好公园绿化，增设娱乐设施，把公园搞得更好。
