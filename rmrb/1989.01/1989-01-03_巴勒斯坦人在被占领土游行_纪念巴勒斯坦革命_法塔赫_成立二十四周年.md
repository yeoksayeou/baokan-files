Palestinians today marched in Arab-occupied territories to commemorate the 24th anniversary of the establishment of the Palestinian revolution and the main faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization, "Fatah."

According to reports from Jerusalem, clashes occurred between Palestinians and Israeli troops in several cities, villages, and refugee camps in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

In Jenin and Ramallah, three youths were injured by live ammunition. In the outskirts of Ramallah, many villagers displayed Palestinian flags and held up portraits of PLO leader Yasser Arafat and the late leader Abu Jihad, commemorating the first attack launched by "Fatah" against Israeli forces on January 1, 1965.

A report quoted an Israeli military spokesman as saying that the Israeli military expelled 13 Palestinians on January 1, accusing them of actively participating in anti-Israeli struggles in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Israeli helicopters dropped them into southern Lebanon.

The spokesman added that another 12 people had also received expulsion orders for the same reasons.

　　巴勒斯坦人在被占领土游行
    纪念巴勒斯坦革命“法塔赫”成立二十四周年
    新华社开罗１月１日电  巴勒斯坦人今天在阿拉伯被占领土上举行游行，纪念巴勒斯坦革命和巴勒斯坦解放组织主流派“法塔赫”组织成立２４周年。
    据来自耶路撒冷的报道说，他们在约旦河西岸和加沙地带的一些城市、村落和难民营中与以色列军队发生了冲突。
    在杰宁和拉马拉城，有３名青年被铅弹打伤。拉马拉郊外的许多村民打出巴勒斯坦旗帜，高举巴解组织领导人阿拉法特和已故领导人阿布·杰哈德的画像，纪念１９６５年１月１日“法塔赫”组织向以军发起的第一次袭击。
    报道援引１名以色列军方发言人的话说，以色列军方１日驱逐了１３名巴勒斯坦人，指控他们在约旦河西岸和加沙地带的反以斗争中表现积极。以色列直升机将他们空投到黎巴嫩南部。
    这名发言人说，另外１２人也因相同原因接到被驱逐的命令。
