The Path of Patriotism

Mu Hui

Sten Congwen was certainly not a Marxist, but he was a patriot.

He loved his country through his actions and in his unique way.

His novels exude a rural charm and his deep affection for his hometown, nature, and the people, infecting readers with a love for the people, land, and country that produced these stories. Isn't this patriotism? Not to mention, his works have added luster to China.

However, due to the peculiar logic that prevailed in the past, simply because he had praised and even criticized the Kuomintang without saying anything good about the Communist Party, and because of his limited understanding of labeling the War of Liberation as a "tragedy of national suicide," this figure, who was disliked by the Kuomintang, was also seen as a right-wing literary figure opposed to the left-wing literary movement—the "Zhan Guo Ce Pai." His works were completely denied, to the extent that, as Ba Jin said, "He wrote so many works, made such great contributions, but we know very little about him."

This path was blocked, and Sten Congwen delved into the history museum, working as an ordinary guide and engaging in cultural relic research. He worked tirelessly among the relics, locked in a room but oblivious. His credo was that "a citizen must never be passive, because he is the true master." His research not only achieved remarkable results but also actively prepared "useful" thematic materials for this person and that person. He selflessly donated his precious books, paintings, and cultural relics, which he had collected with his own money, to the museum...

In theory, such patriotic deeds that are not closely related to politics should be acknowledged, right? In fact, this path was also not smooth. During the decade of turmoil, the "patriotic experts" said, "This is feudal, bourgeois, and revisionist, it is emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties. To prevent revisionism and to save the working people from suffering twice, the books, manuscripts, and materials collected over several decades were either sold to the scrap collector for 7.5 fen per kilogram or burned by the military representative for 'disinfection'!"

Is there a more severe blow than this? I once heard that during the Cultural Revolution, a teacher I respect, under the "order" and supervision of the rebels, personally burned the materials and manuscripts he had written word by word over several decades. I visited the teacher several times but never dared to ask about this matter. I understand that those who know nothing about the country's culture and are ignorant of scholarship have a sense of pride in such burning. Over the past two thousand years, how much of our vast and beautiful cultural heritage has been reduced to ashes in this "pride"! But for those who know the priceless value of these national treasures, how cruel this violence is! In this sense, Kang Sheng, who stole a large number of cultural relics, at least had a little contribution: he did not smash and destroy them!

If it were someone else, if it were me, I might have been completely discouraged and unable to resume my old profession. However, Sten Congwen still completed the task entrusted to him by Zhou Enlai before his death. Without a deep love for the country, without a passionate devotion to the cause, how can one explain such superhuman strength?!

"Patriotism also requires life, and only those with abundant life force can be patriotic... Towards the country, one pretends to be enthusiastic; towards work, one is careless; towards people, one has no feelings; towards ideals, one is extremely afraid," this is the love of an eunuch. Sten Congwen is the kind of patriot with abundant life force that he described.

What is frightening is that those who seem enthusiastic towards the country often think they have monopolized the wholesale rights of patriotism, like a speculator monopolizing scarce aluminum ingots and color TVs, excluding true patriots from the patriotic ranks, not allowing them to love, not allowing them to love their country in their own way. Shouldn't this abnormal situation be thoroughly changed in the future?

　　爱国之道
    牧惠
    沈从文当然不是一位马克思主义者，可他是一位爱国者。
    他用自己的实际行动和特有的方式爱他的祖国。
    他的小说，散发出乡土气息和他对故乡、对大自然和人民情致缠绵的爱，使读者也被感染得爱上这些故事里的人、土地和产生这些作品的国家。这不就是爱国？更不要说，他的作品给我们中国增添了光彩。
    但是，由于我们过去相当盛行着的古怪逻辑，仅仅因为他在既有赞赏甚至还曾经批评过国民党的同时没有说过共产党的好话，还由于认识的局限把解放战争说成是“民族自杀的悲剧”，于是，这位在国民党眼里讨厌的人物，又被视为站在左翼文学运动对立面的右翼文人——“战国策派”。他的作品被全盘否定，以至于像巴老说的那样，他“写了那么多作品，贡献那么大，我们知道的人却很少”。
    此路不通，沈从文一头钻进了历史博物馆，以一个普通讲解员的身份，搞文物研究。他废寝忘食地在文物堆中转来转去，被反锁在屋里却毫无察觉。他的信条是“一个公民永远不许可消极，因为，他是真正的主人”。他的研究，不仅成绩显著，而且还积极地为这人那人准备了“××有用”、“×××有用”的专题材料，还无私地把自己花钱着迷搜罗来的珍贵书画、文物无偿地捐给了博物馆……在这方面，他对祖国做出的贡献绝不亚于他的小说。
    按理，这种同政治不大相干的爱国之举应当得到承认了吧？其实，此路也并不通畅。在十年浩劫的时代，“爱国大家”说，这是封、资、修，是帝王将相、才子佳人，为了防修反修，为了劳动人民免吃二茬苦、免受二茬罪，几十年内搜购来的图书资料、著作、文稿或被以七分半一公斤的价格卖给了废品收购站，或被军代表“代为消毒”而付之一炬！
    还有比这种打击更沉重的吗？我曾听说过，在“文革”中，一位我所尊敬的老师，在造反派的“勒令”和监督下，亲手焚毁了几十年来一字一句书写下来的资料和文稿。我几次去探望老师，却始终不敢问及这件事。我懂得，对祖国文化一无所知的人，对做学问一窍不通的外行，醉心于这种焚毁甚至还有自豪感。两千年来，我们浩大而优美的文化遗产，有多少在这种“自豪感”中化为灰烬！但是，对于懂得这些国宝无价的行家来说，该是多么残酷的暴行啊！从这个意义上来说，盗窃大量文物的康生倒还有一点贡献了：他没有砸烂毁坏！
    换一个人，假如是我，很可能从此一蹶不振，再也无力去重操旧业。然而，沈从文却依然完成了周恩来生前对他的嘱托。没有对祖国倾心的爱，没有对事业痴情的恋，怎样去解释这种超负荷的力量？！
    “爱国也需要生命，生命力充溢者方能爱国……对国家，貌作热诚，对事，马马虎虎；对人，毫无情感；对理想，异常吓怕”，乃是实无所爱的阉人。沈从文就是他所说的那种生命力充溢的爱国者。
    可怕的是，偏偏那种对国家“貌似热诚”的人，却往往自以为像倒爷把紧俏的铝锭、彩电垄断起来似地垄断了爱国的批发权，把真正的爱国者排斥在爱国队伍之外，不准爱，不准按自己的方式爱自己的祖国。这种不正常的状况，难道不应该在今后来一个彻底的改变吗？
