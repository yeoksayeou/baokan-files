Palestinians in occupied territories hold "Day of People's Anger"
PLO Chairman and Islamic Conference condemn Israeli atrocities

	NEW YORK, Jan. 21 (Xinhua) -- In response to the call by the Palestinian Uprising National Unified Leadership to designate January 20 as the "Day of People's Anger," Palestinians in the occupied territories held large-scale demonstrations on that day to protest against Israeli occupation and oppression.

	Palestinians waved Palestinian flags and held up portraits of Arafat during the demonstrations. The Israeli occupying authorities took various measures to suppress the demonstrators, resulting in the deaths of two Palestinian youths who were shot by Israeli soldiers, and dozens injured by lead bullets, plastic bullets, and rubber bullets.

	The Israeli occupying forces also surrounded 15 villages, conducted forced searches of residents' homes, and arrested several people.

	On the same day, Palestinians in Nablus, Tulkarm, and other places attacked vehicles of the Israeli occupying authorities.

	NEW YORK, Jan. 21 (Xinhua) -- PLO Chairman Salah Khalaf, in a telegram to the speakers of Arab parliaments, called on Arab countries to expose Israeli atrocities in the occupied territories.

	He pointed out that the Israeli occupying authorities deliberately violated human rights, threatened to assassinate PLO Executive Committee Chairman Yasser Arafat and other Palestinian leaders, shot demonstrators, demolished houses, closed schools, besieged towns, villages, and refugee camps, and refused to allow injured Palestinians to receive medical treatment. All these actions have led to an escalation of confrontations between Palestinians and the Israeli occupying authorities.

	Khalaf called on Arab countries to condemn Israeli atrocities and support the Palestinian people in their struggle for self-determination and the establishment of an independent state on their own land.

	According to another report, PLO Executive Committee Chairman Yasser Arafat on the same day called on the United Nations and other international organizations to intervene in Israeli atrocities in the occupied territories.

	NEW YORK, Jan. 21 (Xinhua) -- According to the Tunisian African News Agency, the Islamic Conference Organization issued an emergency appeal on January 20, calling on the United Nations Security Council member states and international public opinion to intervene and put an end to the genocidal policies of Israeli Zionists against residents in the occupied territories.

	The Islamic Conference Organization also called on all peace-loving forces and international organizations to take responsibility in the face of Israel's genocidal policies.

	It said that the only way to end Israel's violence and repression is for the United Nations to intervene immediately and convene an international peace conference on the Middle East.

　　被占领土巴勒斯坦人举行“人民愤怒日”    
    巴全委会主席和伊斯兰会议谴责以色列暴行
    新华社突尼斯１月２１日电  据巴勒斯坦通讯社报道，为响应巴勒斯坦起义全国统一指挥部把１月２０日定为“人民愤怒日”的号召，被占领土巴勒斯坦人在２０日举行了大规模的示威游行，抗议以色列的占领和压迫。
    巴勒斯坦人挥舞着巴勒斯坦旗帜，高举阿拉法特的画像举行示威游行。以色列占领当局采取了各种措施镇压示威群众，有２名巴勒斯坦青年被以色列士兵开枪打死，几十人被铅弹、塑料子弹和橡皮子弹打伤。
    以色列占领军还包围了１５个村庄，强行搜查居民住宅，并逮捕多人。
    同一天，巴勒斯坦人在纳布卢斯、图勒卡尔姆等地袭击了以色列占领当局的车辆。
    新华社安曼１月２１日电　巴勒斯坦全国委员会主席萨耶赫２１日在致阿拉伯各国议会议长的电报中呼吁阿拉伯各国揭露以色列在被占领土的暴行。
    他指出，以色列占领当局故意侵犯人权，威胁暗杀巴解组织执委会主席阿拉法特和其他巴勒斯坦领导人，枪杀示威群众，拆除民房，关闭学校，包围城镇、村庄和难民营，拒不让受伤的巴勒斯坦人进医院治疗。所有这些行径导致巴勒斯坦人同以色列占领当局的对抗行动不断加剧。
    萨耶赫呼吁阿拉伯国家谴责以色列的暴行并支持巴勒斯坦人民为争取自决权利和在自己国土上建立一个独立国家而进行的斗争。
    另据报道，巴解组织执委会主席阿拉法特在同一天呼吁联合国和其他国际组织对以色列在被占领土的暴行进行干预。
    新华社突尼斯１月２１日电　据突尼斯非洲通讯社报道，伊斯兰会议组织２０日发出紧急呼吁，要求联合国安理会成员国和国际舆论进行干预，结束以色列犹太复国主义者对被占领土上的居民实行的灭绝政策。
    伊斯兰会议组织还呼吁一切爱好和平的力量和国际组织面对以色列的灭绝政策承担起责任来。
    它说，结束以色列这种暴力和镇压的唯一途径是联合国立即进行干预和召开中东和平国际会议。
