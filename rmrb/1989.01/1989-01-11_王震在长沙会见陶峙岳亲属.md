Wang Zhen, Vice Chairman of the State, and other leading comrades, this afternoon in Changsha, warmly received more than 30 relatives of General Tao Zhiyue. Wang Zhen praised General Tao Zhiyue for his patriotism and love for the people, calling him an outstanding son of the Chinese nation. One of General Tao's great achievements was in September 1949, when he led 100,000 troops to launch a peaceful uprising, assisting the troops advancing into Xinjiang to smoothly enter the region. This made Xinjiang, which accounts for one-sixth of the country's territory, an indispensable part of the People's Republic of China. Wang Zhen hopes that General Tao's relatives will carry on his wishes, promote patriotism, and strive for the socialist modernization and the completion of the great cause of national reunification.

During the reception, Comrade Xiao Ke recalled the years he worked with Tao Zhiyue, saying, "We cooperated very well. Today, seeing so many of his relatives here, I am very happy."

Five relatives of Tao Zhiyue, who rushed from Taiwan to attend the funeral, also participated in the reception. Tao's second son in Taiwan said, "The country's arrangements for my father's funeral are so good, we feel honored. I will definitely bring back my father's patriotism to Taiwan, pass it on to future generations, and be a true Chinese."

　　王震在长沙会见陶峙岳亲属
    新华社长沙１月１０日电  （记者刘志权）国家副主席王震等领导同志，今天下午在长沙亲切接见了陶峙岳的３０多位亲属。王震称赞陶峙岳将军爱国爱民，是中华民族的优秀儿女。陶将军的一个巨大功勋，就是１９４９年９月，率领十万官兵，毅然举行和平起义，协助进军新疆部队顺利入疆，使占全国１／６面积的西陲边塞新疆，成为人民新中国不可分割的重要组成部分。王震希望陶将军的亲属继承陶将军的遗愿，发扬爱国主义精神，为社会主义四化建设和完成祖国统一大业而奋斗。
    在接见时，肖克同志回忆了他与陶峙岳合作共事的岁月，他说，我们合作得很好，今天在这里见到他这么多亲属，我很高兴。
    专程从台湾赶来奔丧的陶峙岳五位亲属也参加了接见。陶老在台湾的二儿子说，国家对先父后事的安排这样好，我们感到光荣，我一定要把先父的爱国精神带回台湾，传给子孙，作一个堂堂正正的中国人。
