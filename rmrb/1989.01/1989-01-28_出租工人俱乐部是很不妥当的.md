Your newspaper published a letter from a reader on December 10, 1988, titled "Renting Out the Workers' Club, How Can Workers Have No Opinions?" We immediately reported this to the county committee and higher-level leaders and held a meeting to discuss it. We sincerely accept the criticism from the masses.

We had signed contracts with relevant parties to rent out the third floor of the workers' club building to the county's food company and the first-floor lobby to someone else to open a restaurant. This was very inappropriate.

We will take the following measures to improve the situation:

1. We will actively work to terminate the contracts as soon as possible to make use of the first-floor lobby and the third floor of the workers' club building for cultural and recreational activities.

2. Currently, our workers' club still has an auditorium that can accommodate nearly a thousand people and seven basement rooms that are not being utilized. We will repair and equip these spaces to hold various recreational activities.

### 出租工人俱乐部是很不妥当的

　　出租工人俱乐部是很不妥当的
    你报１９８８年１２月１０日第五版刊登《出租工人俱乐部，职工怎能无意见》的读者来信，我们立即向县委和上级领导人作了汇报，并开会进行了研究，我们诚恳接受群众的批评。
    我们曾与有关人员签订合同，把工人俱乐部楼房的三楼租给了我县食品公司，一楼门厅租给了别人开饭店，这样做是很不妥当的。
    我们将采取以下改进措施：
    一、积极做工作，尽量提前解除合同，以便利用工人俱乐部楼房的一楼门厅和三楼，安排文体活动。
    二、目前我们工人俱乐部尚有可容纳近千人的礼堂和７间地下室没有被利用，我们决定设法修整，添置设备，举办各种游艺活动等。　　安徽涡阳县总工会
