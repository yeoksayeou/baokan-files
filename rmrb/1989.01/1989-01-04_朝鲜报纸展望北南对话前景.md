North Korean government organ *Democratic Korea* on January 3 published an article on the prospects for North-South dialogue in 1989, saying that this year will see various dialogues between North and South Korea.

The article said that this year, the North and South will hold a joint parliamentary conference to discuss the signing of a non-aggression pact, hold North-South sports talks on forming a unified team to participate in the 11th Asian Games, and hold North-South student talks to discuss the issue of South Korean university students participating in the 13th World Youth Festival to be held in Pyongyang. If these talks achieve results, then North-South relations will improve this year.

The article concluded by saying that dialogue must create a favorable atmosphere to eliminate the confrontation through dialogue and cooperation. The South Korean authorities must abandon the idea of confrontation and decide to stop the "Team Spirit" military exercises.

　　朝鲜报纸展望北南对话前景
    朝鲜政府机关报《民主朝鲜》一月三日就一九八九年朝鲜北南对话前景发表文章说，今年将是朝鲜北南进行各种对话的一年。
    文章说，今年北南双方将要进行关于签订互不侵犯条约的国会联合会议，举行有关组成统一代表队参加第十一届亚运会的北南体育会谈，举行讨论让南朝鲜大学生参加在平壤举行的十三届世界青年联欢节问题的北南学生会谈等。如果这些会谈取得成果，那么，今年北南关系将会得到改善。
    文章最后说，对话必须创造有利的气氛，以对话与合作的方法消除对峙状态。南朝鲜当局必须放弃对峙观念，下决心停止“协作精神”军事演习。
