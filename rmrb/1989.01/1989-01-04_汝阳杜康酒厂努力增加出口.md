Ru Yang Du Kang Wine Factory has made increasing its foreign exchange earnings through exports a key focus, accumulating $10.13 million in foreign exchange over the past three years and becoming a leading export enterprise in Henan Province.

The factory is located in Du Kang Village, the site where Du Kang is said to have brewed wine, giving it a unique natural advantage. Just five years after its establishment, the factory's products began entering the international market. It has since set up 18 export information liaison points in 13 countries, designing bottle shapes and label artwork according to foreign market demands. In 1986, the factory developed 12 new products with alcohol contents of 39°, 45°, and 52° to suit international tastes, which are now sold in 52 countries and regions, with annual exports reaching 500,000 kilograms.

Currently, the Du Kang wine series has won 27 gold and silver awards in various national wine competitions. In October 1988, it won three gold medals from the Ministry of Commerce in a single event.
