The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Announces with Deep Grief:

The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China solemnly announces:

Our country's great patriot, renowned statesman, loyal friend of the Communist Party of China, outstanding leader of Chinese Tibetan Buddhism, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Seventh National People's Congress, Honorary President of the Buddhist Association of China, the Tenth Panchen Erdeni Qoi Gyaintsen, due to a sudden heart attack, despite emergency rescue efforts from all sides, unfortunately passed away at 20:16 on January 28, 1989, at his new palace, Dechen Gangsang Phodrang, in Shigatse, Tibet Autonomous Region, at the age of 51.

The Tenth Panchen Erdeni Qoi Gyaintsen left Beijing on January 9, 1989, to go to Shigatse, Tibet Autonomous Region, to preside over the opening ceremony of the joint tomb of the Fifth to Ninth Panchen Lamas—Panchen Eastern Tomb, Zhashi Namjie. Under his personal arrangement and organization, this opening ceremony was grand and successful, vividly embodying the Communist Party of China's policies on nationalities and religion. However, the Tenth Panchen Erdeni Qoi Gyaintsen, due to overwork, suffered a sudden heart attack and passed away despite rescue efforts.

The passing of Vice Chairman Qoi Gyaintsen is a great loss to our country, as it has lost a great patriot and statesman. The Tibetan people have lost an outstanding patriotic religious leader. This is a significant loss for our country and for all ethnic groups in the nation, including the Tibetan people. We believe that the Tibetan people and all ethnic groups in the nation will carry forward Vice Chairman Qoi Gyaintsen's spirit of loving the Communist Party of China and the socialist motherland, and strive to safeguard national unity and ethnic solidarity, implement the line, principles, and policies of the Thirteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, build a united, prosperous, and civilized socialist new Tibet, build socialism with Chinese characteristics, and promote the common prosperity of all ethnic groups!

Vice Chairman Qoi Gyaintsen will be forever remembered!

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shigatse, January 29: The Tenth Panchen Erdeni Qoi Gyaintsen left Beijing by special plane on January 9, 1989, to go to Shigatse, Tibet Autonomous Region, to preside over the opening ceremony of the joint tomb of the Fifth to Ninth Panchen Lamas—Panchen Eastern Tomb, Zhashi Namjie. Under his personal organization, this opening ceremony was grand and successful. At the celebration meeting for the opening ceremony, he delivered an important long speech, enthusiastically praising the Communist Party of China's policies on nationalities and religion, and emphasizing the extreme importance of safeguarding national unity and ethnic solidarity. After the celebration meeting, he personally presided over separate symposiums with invited leaders and religious figures, listening to everyone's opinions on further improving work in Tibet and other Tibetan areas and developing the economy and culture of the Tibetan areas. Unfortunately, the Panchen Lama suffered a sudden heart attack due to overwork. Upon learning of this, Secretary of the Tibet Autonomous Region Party Committee Hu Jintao, Chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Region People's Government Dogai Cairang, and Vice Chairman Mao Rubai immediately led medical personnel from Lhasa to Shigatse to organize rescue efforts. General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee Zhao Ziyang and other members of the Politburo Standing Committee, upon hearing the news, immediately decided to send CPC Central Committee Secretariat Candidate Member Wen Jiabao and Deputy Minister of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee Wu Lianyuan, along with a team of renowned heart disease experts from Beijing Hospital, to Shigatse by special plane for rescue. Despite rescue efforts from all sides, he unfortunately passed away.

The funeral and related matters of the Panchen Lama will be handled according to Tibetan Buddhist rituals.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shigatse, January 29: The reporter learned from the rescue team of Vice Chairman Qoi Gyaintsen that Vice Chairman Qoi Gyaintsen suddenly fell ill at 4:30 AM on January 28. At that time, he said he had pain in his back and both upper arms. The attending physician immediately conducted an examination. At that time, Vice Chairman Qoi Gyaintsen was conscious, with a respiratory rate of 20 times per minute, blood pressure of 120/90 mmHg, and a heart rate of 86 beats per minute, which was regular. The electrocardiogram showed acute inferior and extensive anterior myocardial infarction. Medical personnel immediately administered oxygen, vasodilators, pain relievers, sedatives, and anti-arrhythmic drugs, and organized consultations and rescue efforts with experts from various hospitals in Shigatse and Lhasa. At 8:25 AM, during the re-examination of the electrocardiogram, he suddenly convulsed and lost consciousness. At 8:34 AM, the electrocardiogram showed ventricular fibrillation. Immediate measures were taken, including external chest compression, intracardiac injection of cardiotonic drugs, external chest compression, and the use of a ventilator for artificial respiration. At 18:30, a team of experts consisting of Wang Minqing, Director of the Central Health Bureau, Liu Yuanshu, Deputy Director and cardiovascular expert of Beijing Hospital, and Chief Physician of Cardiovascular Department Shen Jin, arrived and performed two intracardiac pacemakers, continuing rescue efforts, but to no avail. He passed away at 20:16. The final diagnosis was acute inferior and extensive anterior myocardial infarction leading to cardiac arrest (ventricular fibrillation).
