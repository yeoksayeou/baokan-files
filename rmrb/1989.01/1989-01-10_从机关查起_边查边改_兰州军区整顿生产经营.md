The Lanzhou Military Region has been conducting inspections and rectifications of tax, financial, and price issues, as well as cleaning up and rectifying production and operational activities. They have insisted on starting from the organs, rectifying as they go, and enforcing orders strictly.

It is understood that currently, the leadership organs of the Lanzhou Military Region have promptly corrected issues such as military-enterprise confusion, buying and selling for profit, arbitrary price increases, arbitrary expansion of operational scope, and overdue tax payments that were discovered during the inspections.

The Central Military Commission inspection team believes that the Lanzhou Military Region has organized this work forcefully, grasped it solidly, and acted decisively.

The Lanzhou Military Region's cleanup and rectification work began in mid-November of last year. The Military Region Party Committee believed that to ensure the inspection and rectification work is not just for show, the Military Region leadership organs must take action and set an example. The staff, political, and logistics departments established inspection and rectification leading groups and specialized inspection agencies. Leaders at all levels went deep into directly affiliated regiments and above units, as well as production and operational units, to guide the inspection and rectification work. The Military Region organs and directly affiliated units focused on key projects and major issues during the inspections. The Northwest Operations Department of the Military Region's Xinxiang Company terminated negotiations with foreign investors to jointly build the Xi'an Grand Hotel. The Longcheng Science and Technology Service Center, affiliated with the Military Region's Headquarters, proactively paid the 1.2 million yuan in taxes that were originally approved by local relevant departments to be exempt, and sealed up part of the goods that were sold beyond the operational scope. Various organs stopped approving and purchasing plans for 29 types of controlled commodities.

　　从机关查起　边查边改
    兰州军区整顿生产经营
    据新华社兰州电  （通讯员杨战宏  记者秦卫东）兰州军区在税收、财务、物价检查和清理整顿生产经营活动中，坚持从机关抓起，边查边改，令行禁止。
    据了解，目前兰州军区领导机关对查出的军企不分、倒买倒卖、擅自涨价、任意扩大经营范围、拖欠税款等问题已及时进行了纠正。中央军委检查组认为，兰州军区对这项工作组织有力，抓得扎实，行动坚决。
    兰州军区的清理整顿工作是从去年十一月上旬开始的。军区党委认为，要使查整工作不走过场，军区领导机关一定要拿出行动，做出表率。司、政、后机关成立了查整领导小组和专门检查机构。各级领导深入直属团以上部队和生产经营单位指导查整工作。军区机关和直属单位在检查中突出抓了重点项目和重大问题。军区新兴公司西北经营部终止了与外商合资兴建西安大厦的谈判。军区司令部所属长城科技服务中心主动补交了原来经地方有关部门同意免交的十二万元税款，并封存了超出经营范围经销的部分商品。各机关停止了对二十九种专控商品的审批和购买计划。
