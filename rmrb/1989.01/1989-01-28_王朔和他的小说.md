Title: Wang Shuo and His Novels
Author: Lù Yún Yún

When Wang Shuo decided to seriously pursue something he truly wanted to do, he chose to write novels. Thus, in 1983, he quit his job at a pharmaceutical company, ignoring his family's surprise and opposition, and spread out a stack of manuscript paper. He wrote the novellas "Air Hostess," "Rising from the Sea," "Half Flame, Half Sea Water," "Rubber Man," and "Rascal," all of which were published in magazines. Four of these were adapted into films in 1988. Recently, he published the novel "Playing with Heartbeats" and joined the Chinese Writers Association. Director Zhang Nuanxin is also preparing to film this work.

These events, along with his history of military service and business experience, are well-known to his enthusiastic readers. However, Wang Shuo himself has become more of an enigma. The urban men and women in his writings, with their astonishing lifestyles and values, interact on the stage of life so naturally and as if it were their destiny. Yet, he describes them with such ease and vividness, as if he were one of them.

Interestingly, those who read his novels often do not understand the characters, and the characters themselves rarely read novels. Wang Shuo has not become a "bridge" for communication but has instead become part of the divide.

Facing such an active author, the critical community has been surprisingly quiet. Occasionally, someone writes a review, but it seems as if they are not reviewing Wang Shuo at all. The critics hold glass slippers, but Wang Shuo is not Cinderella.

Is Wang Shuo really so unfamiliar and unbelievable?

Wang Shuo himself says that he writes novels to make a living. Indeed, he has a wife and a daughter, and he relies on turning his words into manuscript fees to fulfill his responsibilities as a householder.

Wang Shuo writes seriously. He writes about things he has seen clearly and understood thoroughly. If people say it's good, he is delighted; if they don't like it, he doesn't care.

Wang Shuo has no workplace, and his time is his own. When he has written enough words, he reads the books he likes, chats with interesting people, and visits places of interest. He doesn't need to ask for permission or report to anyone. When his wife goes to work, he can also take care of the household chores.

Because Wang Shuo's life is real, the things he does have real significance. His novels are gradually taking on a certain mission. The "modern lumpenproletariat" in his writings are products of the contemporary social tide in China, a part of society. Whether they ride the wave or take advantage of reform, they adapt to each other. Whether they prosper or fail, they live more freely and enjoy life more. Although their days may involve running around and exerting all their strength, they do not feel burdened by life or pretend to be someone they are not for others' opinions.

The difference between the author and them is that he not only lives freely but also lives consciously. His life is balanced.

The strength of Wang Shuo's novels lies not only in his excellent portrayal of a certain type of person's life but also in the infusion of his attitude towards life. All traditional values that bind him have become ineffective; he only follows the rules that benefit life. He faces the true nature of people, cherishes his own life experiences, and only does what he decides to do.

When a person thinks, lives, and expresses himself in the simplest, most direct, and unadorned way, people find him unfamiliar. To "understand" him, one must select some familiar ornaments to adorn him, so as to be able to "explain" him. When did this start?

In fact, a beneficial life can have many ways of living. Each person, at each stage, chooses only one of them. Changing a way of living, changing an attitude towards life, does not necessarily mean selling out principles; deviating from the tracks set by others does not necessarily mean going astray; even if criticized, one remains unperturbed; discovering others acting as mentioned does not cause shock or heartache, leading to interference or commentary. Using one's own eyes to see the world, using one's own brain to think about life, allowing only one's own heart to control oneself, doing what one can—Wang Shuo is just like this.

In the end, Wang Shuo is just an ordinary, normal person.

Wang Shuo has become famous. Apart from more social interactions and easier manuscript fees, he does not feel much difference. He is very clear that novels are far less important in the lives of ordinary people than they are in the eyes of writers.

He feels he has not yet written a work that truly satisfies him.

He loves the sea, and perhaps one day he will stop writing and just go swimming.

### 王朔和他的小说

　　王朔和他的小说
    陆芸芸
    当王朔决定认认真真地做一件自己真正想做的事情时，他选择了小说。
    于是１９８３年他丢掉医药公司的“铁饭碗”，回到家里，不顾家人的惊异与反对，摊开了一叠稿纸。他写了中篇小说《空中小姐》、《浮出海面》、《一半是火焰，一半是海水》、《橡皮人》、《顽主》等，不仅全都上了刊物，而且后四部分别为影界人士所看中，于１９８８年同时搬上银幕。最近他又发表了长篇小说《玩的就是心跳》，加入了中国作家协会。张暖忻导演又准备开拍这后一部作品了。
    这些，连同他那当过兵、经过商的历史，早已为他的踊跃的读者们所熟知。但王朔本人却越来越是一个谜。他笔下的那些城市男女，以令人目瞪口呆的生活方式和价值观，相互周旋在人生舞台，显得那么自然，那么天经地义。而他偏又描述得从容不迫、淋漓尽致，仿佛他正是其中的一分子。
    有趣的是看小说的人几乎不理解那些人，那些人几乎不看小说，王朔不但没有成为“沟通”的桥梁，反而把自己搭了进去。
    面对这样一个活跃的作者，评论界的反应可谓冷清。偶尔有人下笔评述，却仿佛评的不是王朔。评论者手里有的是水晶鞋，王朔不是灰姑娘。
    王朔真的那么陌生，那么不可思议吗？
    王朔自己说，他写小说是为了闹口饭吃。确实，他有妻子，有女儿，全靠文字变成稿费，去履行一个户主的职责。
    王朔开笔是认真的。他写的都是自己看清楚、想明白的事情。如果大家说好，他为之雀跃；别人不喜欢，他也不在乎。
    王朔没有单位，时间都是自己的。写够了字数就读自己喜欢的书，和有意思的人聊天，去有兴趣的地方游览。不用请示，不用汇报。妻子去上班时，还可以照顾家务。
    因为王朔的生活是实在的，他做的事情也具有实在的意义。他的小说正一点一滴地承担起某种使命。他笔下的那些“现代的流氓无产者”，都是在中国当代社会大潮中应运而生，是社会的一个组成部分。无论是随波逐流，还是钻了改革的空子，总之他们与改革彼此适应。发达也好，栽了也罢，都比从前活得痛快，活得有滋有味。虽然他们的日子也有四处奔波，竭尽全力的时候，但不会心事重重地觉得生活累人，不会为了旁人的评价而装模作样。
    作者与他们的不同之处在于他不但活得自在，而且活得自觉。他的生活是平衡的。
    王朔小说的好处不仅在于他出色地描绘了一种人的生活，更在于其中渗透了他的人生态度。一切传统价值观念的束缚对他已经宣告无效，他只遵守对生活有益的准则。他正视人的本来面目，珍惜自己的人生体验，只做自己决定做的事情。
    当一个人按照最简单、最直接、最不加修饰的方式思维、生活时，人们反而觉得他陌生。为了“理解”他，只能挑选一些大家习惯的饰物来装扮他，以便能够“解释”他。这种事是从哪天开始有的呢？
    其实有益的人生可以有很多种活法儿，每个人每个阶段所选择的不过是其中一种。换一种活法儿，换一种态度去看人生，未必等同于出卖原则；脱离旁人为你规定好的轨迹，未必等同于误入歧途；即使为此非议四起，也若无其事；发现别人如上述行事，决不大惊失色，痛心疾首地去干预、去评说。用自己的眼睛去看世界，用自己的大脑去想生活，只允许自己的心支配自己，做自己力所能及的事情——王朔也不过如此。
    说到底，王朔只不过是一个普通的正常人。
    王朔出名了。除了多些社交来往，稿费更加好挣之外，不会有更多的感觉。他很清楚，小说在老百姓的生活中远不如作家眼里那般重要。
    他觉得还没写出自己真正满意的作品。
    他喜欢大海，或许有一天会停了笔，仅仅去游泳。
