Lovable Minority Ethnic Brothers

In 1988, Datong Hui and Tu Autonomous County in our province suffered from natural disasters such as hail and heavy rain, resulting in a slight decrease in grain production. However, the minority ethnic brothers, understanding the country's difficulties, actively sold their grain after ensuring sufficient food and seeds for themselves. The people from Changning, Houzixi, and other townships drove their horse-drawn carts and tractors, loaded with grain, to the grain depot. The large courtyard in front of the grain warehouse was bustling with people, creating a lively atmosphere. How lovable these minority ethnic brothers are!

Seeing this scene, one cannot help but think of those who waste and squander grain. How will they face themselves?

    可爱的少数民族兄弟
    我省大通回族土族自治县一九八八年连遭冰雹、阴雨等自然灾害，粮食产量略有下降，但少数民族兄弟体谅国家困难，在留足口粮和种子的同时，积极交售征购粮。长宁、后子河等乡的群众驾着马车、开着拖拉机，满载粮食来到粮站。粮库门前的大坪上，人声鼎沸，好不热闹。多么可爱的少数民族兄弟！
    见此情景，不由地想起那些任意糟践、浪费粮食的人们，不知他们将何颜以对？ 青海西宁市　安　庆
