My father-in-law was born in the 26th year of the Guangxu reign. His original hometown is in the eastern part of Beijing, in the area of Wuxian, Xiaozhuang. At the age of seven, he came to Beijing as an apprentice, and later served under the military minister Na Tong.

This old minister loved opera. The stage was set in the garden's Youfeng Hall. Famous actors like Tan Xingpei, Wang Yaochi, and Yang Xiaolou all performed there. Over time, even my father-in-law became an opera enthusiast. However, he could never sing a complete verse; he would always stop mid-sentence, "limping" through it.

His interest in playing Chinese chess, however, never waned.

According to the old man himself, in the hottest days of summer, during the long afternoons when the masters were resting, he would casually find an opponent and crouch under the corridor to play a game on a ceramic stool. But he couldn't play peacefully. As soon as he heard the master cough lightly behind the bamboo curtain, he would immediately stand at attention. Later, like the "Wei Zuzi" carriage driver in the residence of Tie Liang, and the Shao Xing teacher in the meeting room of the Prince of the Regency, he met them all. His chess skills improved, and his friends became more distinguished.

It was rare for the old minister to be in a good mood, occasionally in the inner study, he would casually point to someone nearby, "Come, let's play a game." One had to stand respectfully while playing chess, only lifting a hand when it was time to move a piece. However, a game of chess was rarely completed. If someone came to pay respects, the old minister would often leave his seat, change clothes, and go to the outer study's Yinqiu Hall for tea. The chess game on this side couldn't be taken away; one still had to use a soft feather duster to gently dust the chessboard a couple of times. Who knows when the old minister would remember, and one would have to finish the remaining moves with him.

After serving the old master, he then served the young master. It wasn't until the old minister's grandchildren became members of the Political Consultative Conference that my father-in-law retired and returned home.

After retiring, it seemed easy to sit down and play a game of chess. His chess partners were mostly old neighbors. But since he lived with his grandchildren, he couldn't help but be busy. Sometimes, before he had even started playing, the coal stove would flare up, and he would have to go tend to it, wash the rice... Until all his grandchildren had grown up, gone to school, joined the countryside, returned to the city, and found jobs, and after taking care of his wife's funeral, he finally had some peace. By this time, the old man was nearly eighty years old.

Later, my father-in-law moved into an apartment complex with our family of three and made a few chess friends in the Temple of Earth Park. Every morning, he would go for a walk in the park, play chess under the cypress trees, and enjoy himself. As for listening to opera, although he had a radio and a hearing aid, he didn't use them much. His old ear ailment had worsened. When he was bored, he would only hum a few lines of Tan's "I am like..." When the family discussed changing to a color TV, the old man said, "I get confused by the colors." Only then did we remember that the old man was colorblind.

Perhaps because of standing on duty like a penholder in his youth, he fell ill, and the old man's legs and feet became increasingly unsteady, making it difficult for him to even go out the door. Fortunately, a few chess friends came to visit him. If there was someone at home, they would just brew a pot of tea and respectfully offer it to the old man, then they could busy themselves with their own affairs. Half a day would pass without a sound. It turned out that these few old men also had poor hearing. I still remember that day when I went to refill the teapot, I saw my father-in-law leaning back slightly in his chair, with his sleeves rolled up, quietly waiting for the opponent to place the suspended piece on the board, then he would smile and extend two fingers; as if all the affairs of the world were clearly laid out on the chessboard under his fingers—the expression, the interest, was something I had never seen in this old man before.

But over the past ten years, even these few old chess friends have passed away one by one. Every time the old man asked, I had to cover up a few words. First, I said, "They moved to a new house," and later, I said, "Their old daughter got married and went to enjoy life." The old man sighed after hearing this and gradually stopped asking.

In the past two years, my father-in-law has developed cataracts, and the chess pieces have become increasingly larger. My father-in-law's grandchildren are all busy. Occasionally, the only one who comes to play chess with him is the youngest grandson. The chess pieces looked even larger in the child's hands, but my father-in-law still often made mistakes, frustratingly hitting his own head. When he calmed down, seeing the little grandson staring in fear, he quickly smiled and coaxed, "This chess set, you can take it to play..."

After that, the old man's room was unusually quiet. Not even a half-sentence of "I am like..." could be heard.

My several brothers-in-law have been worried about the old man's mood, discussing the matter of treating the old man's eyes. They said it would be better to bring him back to the other side of the family, where the great-grandchildren could gather around his knees and entertain him.

Finally, the hospital agreed to admit him for treatment, and the family breathed a sigh of relief. A few days before the surgery, the little grandson found that large chess set and carefully wiped it clean.

"When Grandpa comes out of the hospital, he won't have to let me have half the board anymore."

The old man's surname is Feng, his given name is Rulin, and his courtesy name is Hanting. Because "Hanting" coincided with the name of someone with a "historical problem," he was investigated for a few years and even stopped playing chess for a while. Every time he mentioned it, the old man still felt resentful, as if this was the most unsatisfying thing in his life...

### 岳父和他的棋友们

　　岳父和他的棋友们
    韩少华
    我岳父光绪二十六年生人。原籍京东，五河下潲的地界儿。七岁进京学徒，后来又到军机大臣那桐门下当了差。
    这位老中堂爱听戏。戏台就设在花园子幽风堂上。当年的内廷贡奉像谭鑫培、王瑶卿、杨小楼，都来唱过堂会。日久天长，连我岳父也给“熏”成了个戏迷。可总也哼不下个整段儿的来，经常是上半句刚出口，“瘸着腿儿”就收了。
    倒是下象棋的兴致多年没减。
    听老人自己说，当年三伏里老长的晌午，趁上头歇了觉，随便拉个对手，就猫着腰在游廊底下瓷座墩上摆一盘儿。可又未准下得消停。只听竹帘子里主人微嗽一声，登时就做垂手侍立状。以后，像铁良宅里的“卫嘴子”车把式，乃至庆王府议事房儿的绍兴先生，都会过。棋也渐高，朋友也越会越体面。
    难得老中堂兴致好，偶尔在内书房随意指个跟前的，“来，摆一盘儿。”侍棋必当肃立，只该走子儿了，才可抬抬手。不过一盘棋难得下完，来了进谒的，老中堂往往要离座，更衣，过外书房吟秋馆待茶。这边的棋又不敢撤，还得拿软翎儿掸子把棋盘轻轻掸上俩过儿。不定哪会儿老中堂想起来，还得陪着了一了残局。
    侍奉走了老主人又侍奉少主人，直到老中堂的孙辈当上了政协委员，岳父才退休回了家。
    退休了，要坐稳了摆一盘儿，似乎并不难了。棋友么，多是些老街坊。可既跟儿孙们同住，就难免操劳。有时候棋路子还没走开，煤炉子偏旺上来，就得去坐锅，去淘米……等到十几个孙子孙女都肩挨肩地上学、插队、回城、就业了，又料理完了老伴儿的后事，才算真消停下来。这时候，老人已经年近八旬了。
    以后岳父跟我们一家三口住进楼群，又在地坛公园认识了几位棋友。每天清早去坛里遛遛弯儿，柏荫儿里下下棋，也算一乐儿。至于听戏么，虽有收音机、助听器，却不大用了。早年的耳疾渐重了起来。闷了也只哼几句谭派“我好比……”家里商量着换台彩电，老人又说，“带色儿的我可看着乱得慌。”这才想起老人色盲。
    许是年轻时候总笔管儿似的站班儿，受了病，老人腿脚越来越不行，连门也难出了。所幸几位棋友找上门来。遇着家里有人，只沏壶茶给老人敬上去，就尽可忙自己的了。半天儿也听不见响动儿。原来这几位老人也大都耳力不济。还记得那天我去给茶壶里续水，见岳父微靠椅背儿，浅袖着手，静候对方把悬在半空里的那颗子儿落定了，才含笑伸出两个指头；仿佛世间万事万物都在这指头底下的棋盘上明摆着呢——那神情，那意趣，是我从没在这老人身上见过的。
    可十来年间，连这几位老棋友也相继去世了。老人每问起来，我总得遮掩几句。先说是“人家换着新房搬走啦”，后又说“人家老闺女成了家，跟过去享福去啦”。老人听了只叹口气，渐渐也不再问了。
    近两年，岳父又长了白内障，棋子儿也越换越大。老人的儿孙们都忙。偶尔来陪着下下棋的，只剩下最小的孙子了。棋子儿在孩子手里显得更大，老人却还是常走错，急得直擂自己的脑袋。等缓过神来，见小孙子吓得发愣，又忙笑着哄了一句：“这副棋，你拿去玩儿吧……”
    此后老人屋里竟不怎么出声儿。连半句“我好比”也难再听见。
    我的几位内兄，一直忧虑着老父亲的心境，商量着为老人治眼睛的事。说还是接回那边家里去好一点儿，重孙子们也都可以绕膝笑闹着凑趣儿。
    好不容易盼到医院同意收治，家里才松了口气。手术前几天，小孙子把那副大棋子儿找了出来，细细地擦着。
    “等爷爷出院，准不用爷爷再让我半边子儿了。”
    老人姓冯名儒林，字翰亭。因为这“翰亭”跟某“有历史问题”的重了姓名，那几年竟挨了审查，弄得连棋都戒了一阵子。每提起来，老人还耿耿于怀，仿佛这就是一辈子里最不称心的事情了……　　　　（作者单位：北京教育学院）
