Title: The Many Faces of Grain and Oil Adulteration

In recent years, among the numerous "fake" products such as fake fertilizers, fake pesticides, fake seeds, fake cigarettes, and fake alcohol, a new pair of "twins" has quietly emerged: fake grains and fake oils.

Currently, the types of fake products have evolved from "single-type" to "multi-type." In the past, adulteration was limited to adding rice water to small mill sesame oil, but now it extends from sesame, rapeseed, peanuts to rice, wheat, and green beans—all are subject to adulteration. The adulterants have also evolved from wild plant seeds to river sand, fine soil, mud clumps, and ginger soil.

Adulterators have shifted from "independent" to "series" types. In the border area between two counties, there is a sandy river. On both sides of the river, some villagers specialize in sieving sand and classifying it by grain size; others dye different sizes of river sand to match the color of various grains and oils for disguise; still others specialize in buying and selling processed river sand. The adulteration actions have shifted from "secret" to "open."

Why have grain and oil adulteration incidents become increasingly severe?

Commercial management personnel are overwhelmed and unable to keep up with the problem. Even when they catch someone, they only impose fines. There are many other fake products, and farmers who are deceived have nowhere to turn for help or compensation, leading to a sense of revenge. Some grain and oil procurement units do not distinguish between good and bad quality, uniformly deducting weight and reducing prices, causing some farmers to think that adulteration is advantageous and not adulterating is a loss. Some village cadres turn a blind eye and deaf ear to farmers' adulteration, encouraging some farmers to adulterate boldly.

　　粮油掺假面面观
    近几年，在诸如假化肥、假农药、假种子、假烟、假酒等众多的“假氏大家族”中，又悄悄诞生了一对“双胞胎”：假粮食、假油料。
    目前假品种已由“单一型”转向“多样型”。过去掺假只限于小磨香油里面兑米汤等，现在从芝麻、油菜籽、花生果到大米、小麦、绿豆无不掺假。掺假杂物已由野菜籽发展到河沙、细土、泥团、砂姜土等。
    掺假者由“独立型”转向“系列型”。某两县交界处有一条沙河，两岸部分村民有的专门从事筛沙，按颗粒大小分类；有的根据粮油品种的颜色将不同颗粒的河沙分别着色伪装；有的专门从事收购销售加工好的河沙。掺假行动由“秘密”转向“公开”。
    粮油掺假事件为何愈演愈烈？
    工商管理人员力不从心，查不胜查，偶而抓着一个，也只是给予罚款了事。其他假冒商品多，农民上当受骗，求告无门，索赔无望，产生逆反报复心理。少数收购粮油单位不分优劣，一律扣斤压价，使一些农民造成掺假占便宜、不掺假吃傻亏的心理。部分乡村干部对农民掺假兑假，视而不见，听而不闻，助长了一些农民的大胆掺假心理。
