Shijiazhuang's industrial output value exceeded 10 billion yuan for the first time, and its tax revenue increased by over 40%. Economic theorists have commented on this, saying that during the period of rectification and adjustment, strictly implementing the policy of "having both control and support" can lead to significant achievements in economic work.

Shijiazhuang, the capital of Hebei Province, is a newly developed industrial city. In recent years of reform and opening up, industrial production has shown great vitality.

Last year, enterprises in the city faced a series of challenges, including severe shortages of energy and raw materials, as well as tight transportation and financial conditions. The municipal Party committee and government organized enterprises to find solutions through reform, seeking development during the period of rectification and adjustment, and firmly implemented the policy of "having both control and support." The city stopped 38 projects with a total construction area of 1071,000 square meters and a total investment of 462 million yuan, and restructured or merged 35 enterprises that were highly consumptive, low in efficiency, and produced unmarketable products. This initially adjusted the city's investment, enterprise, and product structures. The freed-up financial and material resources were used to increase the production of market-demand products, agricultural and sideline products, export-earning products, as well as energy and raw material products, and efforts were made to improve the quality of these products. Shijiazhuang became the first city in Hebei Province to achieve an industrial output value of over 10 billion yuan, with an industrial output value of 10.58 billion yuan. Among these, the output value of high-quality branded products accounted for more than one-third. Economic benefits significantly improved, with the realized profits and taxes of budgeted enterprises, and the taxes turned over to the state, increasing by 34.7% and 43.2% respectively compared to 1987.

　　压缩投资规模　确保名优产品    
    石家庄去年利税增长四成
    本报讯  新华社记者王文杰报道：石家庄市去年压缩基建投资规模，确保名优短缺产品的生产，工业产值首次突破百亿元，上交利税增长４成多。经济理论界人士据此发表看法：在治理整顿中，认真执行有压有保的方法，经济工作大有可为。
    河北省省会石家庄市是个新兴工业城市。在近几年的改革、开放中，工业生产迸发活力。
    去年全市企业普遍遇到能源和原材料严重不足，交通运输和资金极为紧张等一系列困难，市委、市政府组织企业从改革中找出路，在治理整顿中求发展，坚决实行了“有保有压”的政策。全市停建了总面积为１０７．１万平方米、总投资为４．６２亿元的３８个项目，转产、兼并了３５个消耗高、效益低、产品不对路的企业，初步调整了全市的投资、企业和产品的结构。把腾出的财力和物力，用于增加市场急需产品、农副产品、出口创汇产品以及能源、原材料产品的生产，并努力提高这些产品的质量。该市成为河北省第一个工业产值过百亿元的城市，工业产值达到１０５．８亿元，其中优质名牌产品的产值占１／３以上。经济效益大幅度提高，全市预算内企业实现利税和上交利税分别比１９８７年提高３４．７％和４３．２％。
