	Morning Star
	Yao Zhenhun

	While the night is at its peak,
	Leave the village behind in your dreams.
	Hit the road.
	The morning star has already been shining since you didn't set off.
	At this moment, your discovery is still a discovery.
	It calmly waits in the east,
	Lonely yet affectionate,
	Like a clear and profound aphorism.
	The morning star guides your journey,
	In reality, it emphasizes your loneliness even more.
	Under the boundless night sky,
	Only the morning star adorns you.
	You and the morning star stand in silence,
	Deep within your souls,
	You and the morning star exchange greetings.
	There is always an association guiding you,
	Behind the vast night,
	Thoughts are soaring inch by inch.
	With the morning star as your companion, you set off,
	Steadily stepping in a rhythm.
	At this time,
	You need to estimate the distance between you and the morning star.
	You are within the plain,
	It is beyond the night.

　　启明星
    姚振函
    趁夜色正高
    把村庄抛在梦境之后
    上路吧
    在你没上路时启明星就亮着了
    此时你的发现仍是发现
    它安闲地守候在东方
    孤独而深情
    如一句明彻的格言
    启明星使你的行程有所参照
    实际上更强调了你的寂寞
    无边的夜空下
    只有启明星装饰着你
    你们无言相对
    遥遥地在灵魂深处
    你和启明星互致问候
    有一种联想始终引导着你
    在高高的夜的背后
    思想正一寸一寸地飞扬
    有启明星相伴你上路了
    重重地踩在一种节奏上
    这时候
    需估算一下你和启明星的距离
    你在平原之内
    它在夜色之外
