The United States will monitor the security situation in Afghanistan. U.S. State Department spokesman Charles Redman said on the 25th that U.S. embassy personnel in Afghanistan will continue to monitor the security situation after February 15. At the same time, he reminded unofficial American personnel engaged in international aid work in Kabul to leave before the Soviet troops withdraw from Afghanistan.

Some Western reports suggest that the situation in Afghanistan may deteriorate rapidly after the Soviet troops fully withdraw on February 15. Some diplomatic personnel from certain countries have already left.

However, Redman stated that as long as it is deemed beneficial and secure, the United States will retain its embassy in Kabul to continue monitoring the security situation there.

　　美国将监视阿富汗的安全局势
    美国国务院发言人查理斯·雷德曼二十五日表示，美国驻阿使馆人员在二月十五日后将继续监视阿富汗的安全局势，同时又提醒在喀布尔从事国际援助工作的非官方派遣的美国人应在苏联军队撤出阿富汗之前离开喀布尔。
    一些西方报道认为，苏军在二月十五日全部撤离阿富汗后，那里的局面有可能会迅速恶化。目前已有一些国家的外交人员已经撤离。
    但雷德曼表示，只要认为有益和稳妥，美国将保留其驻喀布尔的大使馆，以便继续监视那里的安全局势。
