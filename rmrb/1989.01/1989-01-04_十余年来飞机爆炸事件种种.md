On October 6, 1976, a DC-8 passenger plane of the Cuban airline took off from Barbados and crashed into the sea a few minutes later, killing 73 people, including 24 members of the Cuban national fencing team. It was later revealed that this air disaster was caused by a human-induced explosion.

On August 11, 1982, a jetliner of Pan American World Airways flying from Tokyo to Hawaii exploded 140 miles off the coast of Hawaii, killing a 16-year-old Japanese boy and injuring 15 passengers. The plane managed to land safely. No one took responsibility for the explosion.

On June 22, 1985, Air India's flight 182, which departed from Toronto via London to Mumbai, exploded and disintegrated over the Irish Sea, killing all 329 people on board. The Indian government's investigation showed that the plane crashed due to a bomb explosion.

On April 2, 1986, TWA flight 840 from Rome to Athens exploded just as the plane was beginning to land. A bomb placed under a seat exploded, killing four Americans and injuring nine passengers. The plane successfully made an emergency landing at the airport.

On November 29, 1987, Korean Air Lines flight 858 exploded over the border between Thailand and Burma and crashed into the jungle, killing all 115 people on board.

On December 21, 1988, Pan Am flight 103, which departed from London to New York, exploded in mid-air and crashed into the town of Lockerbie in Scotland. All 258 people on the Boeing 747 were killed, and at least 20 people in Lockerbie died. Investigators said they had found conclusive evidence that a bomb explosion caused the plane to crash.
