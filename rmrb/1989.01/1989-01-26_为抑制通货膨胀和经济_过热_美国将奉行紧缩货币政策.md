To curb inflation and economic "overheating," the United States will adopt a tight monetary policy.

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, January 24th - (Reporter Zhao Zijian) To curb inflation and economic "overheating," the United States will adopt a tight monetary policy.

This morning, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan testified before the House Committee on Banking, Finance, and Urban Affairs, stating that given the upward trend in inflation, the United States should adopt restrictive measures rather than stimulate the economy. The central bank's strategic task will be to continue stabilizing prices.

He said that for the United States, the current inflation rate of 4% to 4.5% is clearly too high and must be brought down. He said that last year's drought in the United States led to rising food prices and a depreciation of the dollar, which are the main reasons why inflation has not been controlled.

He also said that if the United States does not take restrictive measures, it will pay a greater price for its economy. At the same time, the United States can no longer rely on external funds to cover its fiscal deficit.

    美国将奉行紧缩货币政策
    新华社华盛顿１月２４日电（记者赵子健）为抑制通货膨胀和经济“过热”，美国将奉行紧缩货币政策。
    今天上午，美国联邦储备委员会主席格林斯潘，在众议院银行、财政和城市事务委员会作证时说，鉴于通货膨胀出现上升势头，当前美国应采取限制措施，而不是去刺激经济。中央银行的战略的中心任务将是继续稳定物价。
    他说，对美国来说，当前４％到４．５％的通货膨胀率，是明显地偏高，必须将它压下来。他说，去年美国干旱导致食品价格上涨，美元汇价下跌，是美国通货膨胀未得到控制的主要原因。
    他还说，美国不采取限制措施，将使其经济付出更大的代价。同时，美国不能再靠外来资金弥补财政赤字。
