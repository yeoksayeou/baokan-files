In London, the "People" magazine published an article on January 20th stating that China is taking more flexible and effective measures to reduce the population and improve its quality.

The article, published in the quarterly magazine run by the International Planned Parenthood Federation, noted that China's voluntary family planning campaign has been remarkably widespread and convincing.

The article mentioned that China implements a policy of one child per couple, but the execution varies in different regions. Minority ethnic groups are allowed some leeway, and the policy is also more flexible in rural areas. The article believes that China's population policy has attracted global attention.
