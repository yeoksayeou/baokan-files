On January 21, a discussion meeting on the reportage "The Years After Mao: A Real Account of the Countryside in Anhui from 1978 to 1980" (published in the June 1988 issue of *Kunlun*) was held in Hefei. The event was jointly organized by the *Kunlun* magazine office, the Anhui branch of the Writers' Association, and the Anhui Agricultural Economic Commission. Writers, critics, and agricultural officials who attended the meeting praised the work for its true portrayal of the inspiring transformation that took place in the Jianghuai region ten years ago. They believed that the work not only revealed the economic and political significance of this transformation but also further exposed its role in helping peasants break free from spiritual shackles and become independent individuals. Participants also pointed out some shortcomings of the work.

　　《毛泽东以后的岁月》讨论会
    一月二十一日，《昆仑》杂志社、作协安徽省分会、安徽农业经济委员会联合举办的报告文学《毛泽东以后的岁月——一九七八至一九八○；安徽农村纪实》（载《昆仑》一九八八年六期）讨论会在合肥市召开。参加会议的作家、评论家以及农业干部赞扬这部作品真实地再现了十年前发生在江淮大地上的一场可歌可泣的农村变革，认为这部作品不仅揭示了这场变革在经济、政治方面的意义，而且进一步揭示了它在促使农民摆脱精神上的枷锁，成为具有独立人格的主人方面的意义。与会者也指出了作品的某些不足。
