Engineer and Deputy Director Li Huifu of the Shijiazhuang Region Water Resources Bureau in Hebei Province has, after years of dedicated research, proposed for the first time in China the theory of establishing a high-efficiency small watershed ecological economic system. This theory recently received affirmation from experts and scholars attending the National Small Watershed Comprehensive Management Conference.

Li Huifu has departed from the traditional static approach to studying landforms and instead views the natural ecology, society, and economy within a small watershed as an organic whole. He dynamically grasps the intrinsic connections between the natural, population, and economic reproduction processes, ensuring their mutual balance and coordinated development. He has proposed a comprehensive set of theories and methods for watershed management, including comprehensive surveys and diagnostics, systematic development and comprehensive management planning, comprehensive prevention and treatment systems, and treatment model designs, as well as implementation organizations and operational management mechanisms. This integrates ecological construction with economic development.

This research achievement has been applied and promoted in some regions of Hebei, yielding significant economic benefits. Within the over 700 square kilometer promotion area, the ecological environment has been improved.

　　集生态建设和经济建设于一体    
    李怀甫创小流域治理新理论
    本报讯  河北省石家庄地区水利局工程师、副局长李怀甫经过多年潜心研究，在国内首次提出建立高效小流域生态经济系统的理论，前不久受到参加全国小流域综合治理工作会议的专家、学者肯定。
    李怀甫一改过去静态研究治理地貌的老方法，而将小流域内自然生态、社会及经济等因素视为一个有机整体，动态地把握自然、人口、经济三种再生产相互平衡和协调发展的内在联系，提出了小流域综合调查与诊断、系统开发与综合治理规划、综合防治体系与治理模式设计、实施组织机构与运行管理机制等一整套综合治理的理论和方法，从而把生态建设和经济建设合为一体。
    此项研究成果在河北一些地区应用推广，获得显著经济效益。在７００多平方公里推广区内，生态环境得到改善。　　　　　　　　（陈国琦　郭瑞敏）
