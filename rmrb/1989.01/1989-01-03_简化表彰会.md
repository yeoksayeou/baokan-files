At the end of the year and the beginning of the new year, various award ceremonies are set to take place one after another. In every sector and industry, there are always outstanding units and individuals who emerge in the course of reform and opening up, and in the rectification of economic order. Holding award ceremonies to praise the light and drive away the darkness, to promote the advanced and inspire the lagging, is understandable. However, is it necessary to hold grand ceremonies to award the outstanding?

Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Government has made new rules to simplify award ceremonies. Recently, various units submitted 14 proposals to the municipal government to hold award ceremonies. After review, 13 were included in the award plan, but no grand ceremonies will be held. The municipal leaders suggested in a consultative manner: "What if we don't hold a grand ceremony? Internal notification or newspaper announcements for awards will suffice. If necessary, a small or short meeting can be held." The news was met with approval from the public, and this move seems to be very popular. Simplifying award ceremonies has at least three advantages: first, it avoids the need for large-scale mobilization, reducing the time and energy spent on meetings; second, it can save a large amount of conference expenses; third, it helps to change the bad social trend of pursuing formality and extravagance.

In recent years, award ceremonies have become increasingly frequent, one after another; this aspect, that aspect; this angle, that angle, overlapping each other. When things go too far, the individuals involved feel uneasy, and the public begins to criticize, resulting in no cumulative effect, but rather the opposite—labor models devalue in people's minds.

Currently, award ceremonies also have a tendency to pursue grandeur. The auditoriums strive for luxury, the medals and certificates strive for exquisite design, the stage is crowded with people, and cars are parked outside. It seems that without this, it would not be enough to show solemnity and enthusiasm. Some even use the name of award ceremonies to hold grand banquets. Such award ceremonies are at the expense of the state and should be abolished.

### 简化表彰会

　　简化表彰会
　　倪平
    岁尾年头，各种表彰会将此起彼伏。各行各业一年来在改革开放中，在整顿经济秩序中，总有一批先进单位先进人物涌现出来。表彰一番，以期歌颂光明，驱除阴暗，发扬先进，启导后进，在情理之中。但表彰先进是不是一定要开盛大的会议呢？这是很可以商讨的。
    上海市政府最近订出新规矩，简化表彰会。新近各单位报送市政府要开１４个表彰会，经审核１３个列入表彰计划，但不开大会，市领导以商量的口吻提出：“不开大会如何？内部通报或登报表彰即可，必要时开个小会、短会。”消息传出，群众叫好，此举看来甚得民心。简化表彰会，至少有三个好处：一不必兴师动众，减少了使人耗费时间和精力的会议；二可以节约一大笔会议费用；三有助于改变追求形式、铺张浪费的不良社会风气。
    近年来，表彰会越来越多，这一行，那一行；这个角度，那个角度，重重叠叠。事情一过分，本人为之不安，群众开始非议，结果并没有产生叠加效应，反而容易走向另一面——人们心目中劳模贬值。
    时下，表彰会还有一股追求阔气的风气，礼堂力求豪华，奖章奖状力求精致，主席台上密密麻麻，会场外轿车云集。仿佛不如此，不足以显示隆重热烈。有的还借表彰会之名，大摆筵席。这样的表彰会慷国家之慨，更应革除。
