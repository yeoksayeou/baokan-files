On the eve of the New Year, the public security, tobacco, price, industry and commerce, and urban management departments of Chengdu City jointly took action. Based on reports from the public and existing clues, they successfully apprehended more than 20 tobacco smugglers in the alleys near Anshun Bridge. They confiscated over 2,000 cartons of various domestic and foreign cigarettes, achieving a resounding victory in this "annihilation campaign."

Anshun Bridge is a well-known black market for cigarette trading in Chengdu City. Relevant departments of the city have conducted multiple crackdowns here, but due to the numerous alleys that provide ample hiding spots, the smugglers return like persistent flies, resuming their illegal activities shortly after each crackdown.

Over time, Anshun Bridge has become a hotbed for criminal activities such as hooliganism, fraud, robbery, extortion, forced sales, adulteration, and brawls. Some individuals have made fortunes here, becoming wealthy overnight. Others have become regulars, undeterred by repeated crackdowns and warnings. A female smuggler surnamed Mi is notorious for her frequent appearances. Authorities seized her in September 1986, confiscating over 40,000 yuan in cash. After being released during the Spring Festival of 1987, she was caught again in a major cigarette smuggling case at Chengdu Railway Station just six months later. Authorities confiscated over 30,000 yuan in cash and 2,300 cartons of Yunwu Mountain brand cigarettes. Despite this, she remained unrepentant, returning to her old ways and frequently appearing at Anshun Bridge. The illegal profits from selling cigarettes have driven these smugglers to take risks. From January to November of last year, 84 criminal cases occurred in the Anshun Bridge area. Residents living nearby are anxious, and passersby are wary, severely disrupting normal life and order. The public strongly condemns these activities. Relevant departments of Chengdu City have made meticulous arrangements, determined to eradicate this "cancer" from the city and completely shut down the black market for cigarettes. Meanwhile, the Urban Management Command Center of Dongcheng District Government of Chengdu City has dispatched some personnel to be stationed in the area for a period, ready to address any issues as they arise. On the night of January 5, the Tobacco Monopoly Bureau of Chengdu City seized 6 individuals at Anshun Bridge, confiscating 4,500 cartons of Huangguoshu brand cigarettes, which are currently being processed.

Currently, Anshun Bridge has returned to its former tranquility. Citizens praise the government for doing a great deed for the people.

　　安顺桥畔“歼灭战”
    本报记者  罗茂城
    元旦前夕，成都市公安、烟草、物价、工商、城管等部门联合行动，根据群众的举报和已掌握的线索，在安顺桥畔的小街小巷，一举抓获了２０余名烟贩，当场收缴了各种中外名烟２０００余条，打了一场漂亮的“歼灭战”。
    安顺桥是成都市有名的卷烟黑市交易市场。成都市有关部门曾在这里多次打击烟贩，但由于街巷较多，易于隐蔽，烟贩们像驱赶不走的苍蝇一样，过不了多久又麇集在这里搞非法交易。
    日子久了，安顺桥逐渐成为一个流氓滋事、倒买倒卖的犯罪场所，行骗抢劫、敲诈勒索、强买强卖、掺杂使假、打架斗殴在这里经常发生。有的人在这里发迹，成了腰缠万贯的暴发户；有的烟贩成了这一带的常客，任你怎样打击警告仍然无动于衷。有个姓米的女烟贩，十处打锣九处有她。有关部门１９８６年９月抓住她，没收了她４万多元现金。１９８７年春节放出以后，不过半年，在成都火车站破获的特大贩烟案中又有她，于是又没收了她３万多元现金，２３００多条云雾山牌香烟。可是教育释放后她仍不思改悔，重操旧业，又经常在安顺桥出没。倒卖香烟的非法收入，使这帮烟贩不惜铤而走险。从去年元月至１１月，安顺桥一带发生的各类犯罪案件竟达８４起。住在这里的居民忧心忡忡，早晚过往行人提心吊胆，严重干扰了人们的正常生活秩序，广大群众深恶痛绝。成都市有关部门作出周密部署，决心割掉这颗城市“毒瘤”，彻底取缔卷烟黑市。与此同时，成都市东城区人民政府城市管理指挥部抽调了部分人员，驻地管辖一段时间，以便随时发现问题随时处理。１月５日深夜，成都市烟草专卖局专卖处在安顺桥又抓获了６人，收缴了４５００条黄果树牌等香烟，现在正在处理中。
    目前，安顺桥又恢复了昔日的平静。市民们称赞政府为人民群众办了一件大好事。
