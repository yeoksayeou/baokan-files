State Councilor and Minister of the State Science and Technology Commission Song Jian recently pointed out that economically underdeveloped regions must resolutely limit the development of non-production and slow-yielding projects, and use limited funds to develop science and technology and education, relying on science and technology to revitalize the economy.

Song Jian made these remarks while listening to a report on the economic development of the Nanyang region in Henan Province through science and technology. As a pilot region for the State Science and Technology Commission and Henan Province to revitalize the economy through science and technology, the Nanyang region has, since 1987, allocated 13 million yuan in interest-subsidized loans from its fiscal budget, using them in a rolling manner to provide financial support. This year, they decided to allocate 2% of their fiscal revenue to scientific and technological development, in addition to the interest-subsidized loans, investing a total of over 40 million yuan, focusing on key areas and allocating funds by project. For the required materials, they set aside special quotas to ensure priority supply.

Song Jian fully approved of the Nanyang region's approach. He said, "The Nanyang region can use its limited funds to combine science and technology with the economy, and I fully support this. However, this must be sustained to become an irreversible trend. As much as possible, funds should not be invested in basic construction projects that have not been thoroughly verified, have low returns, and are non-production-oriented. The key to developing the economy is to improve the input-output ratio of funds. In recent years, China's economy has seen inflation, and the problem lies in too much low-return investment. Economically underdeveloped regions must strictly control the input of funds and, to the greatest extent possible, use limited funds to develop science and technology and education, relying on science and technology to develop short, flat, and fast projects, and to develop agricultural production. This will be beneficial for the stable and healthy growth of the economy."

　　宋健肯定南阳地区做法     
    经济不发达地区脱贫捷径把有限资金用于科技教育
    新华社北京１月２８日电（记者李大宏）国务委员、国家科委主任宋健最近指出，经济不发达地区更要下决心限制那些非生产性和见效慢的项目发展，把有限的资金用于发展科技、教育，依靠科技振兴经济。
    宋健是在听取河南省南阳地区依靠科技发展经济情况汇报时说这番话的。南阳地区作为国家科委和河南省依靠科技振兴经济的试点地区，自１９８７年以来，这个地区财政共拿出贴息贷款１３００万元，滚动使用，从资金上给予扶持。今年，他们决定从财政收入中拿出２％用于科技开发，加上贴息贷款，共投入４０００多万元，突出重点，按项目下达。对所需物资，划出专项指标，优先保证。
    宋健充分肯定了南阳地区的这一做法。他说，南阳地区能把有限的资金用于科技与经济结合，我非常赞成。但是要坚持下去，使之成为一种不可逆转的趋势。尽量不要把资金投入到那些未经充分论证的、效益不高的、非生产性的基本建设上。发展经济，关键是要提高资金的投入产出比例。这几年我国经济出现通货膨胀现象，问题就在于效益低的投入太多。经济不发达地区，更要严格掌握资金的投入，尽最大可能把有限的资金用于发展科技教育，依靠科技发展短、平、快项目，发展农业生产，这样才有利于经济稳步、健康地增长。
