Shaanxi Famen Temple has been open to the public for more than two months, attracting over 900,000 visitors from home and abroad. Among them, more than 2,000 overseas visitors came from Japan, Singapore, India, Australia, and Hong Kong.

In the spring of 1987, archaeologists from Shaanxi Province discovered a rare relic of Sakyamuni Buddha's finger bone, along with a large number of precious artifacts including gold and silver items and textiles from the Tang Dynasty, while clearing the debris of the collapsed Famen Temple Pagoda. The province immediately allocated substantial funds for the restoration and construction of the site. On November 9 of last year, the Famen Temple Museum, which exclusively displays these rare treasures, was completed and opened to the public. The 13-story, 49-meter-high True Body Pagoda was also rebuilt and completed on the same day.

Despite the opening during the cold winter, visitors from all directions still form long queues every day, with the highest number of visitors reaching 50,000 on some days.

Many visitors, after viewing the rare treasures of Famen Temple, felt proud of the brilliant history and culture of the Chinese nation. On December 2 of last year, five journalists from India, the birthplace of Buddha Sakyamuni, visited the site and gave thumbs up, writing in the guestbook: "The excavation of Famen Temple's treasures is a reappearance of ancient Chinese culture and art."

　　陕西法门寺开放两个月
    中外观瞻者累计九十万
    新华社西安１月１８日电  （通讯员刘汉熙、记者王兆麟）陕西法门寺文物旅游区开放两个多月来，已接待国内外游客９０余万人，其中包括来自日本、新加坡、印度、澳大利亚以及香港等地的海外客人２０００余人。
    １９８７年春，陕西省考古工作者在清理倒塌７年的法门寺塔时，在塔基下的地宫中发现了世所仅见的释迦牟尼佛指舍利，以及唐代皇帝供奉的金银器、纺织品等大批珍宝。陕西省对这些历史文物极为重视，当即拨出巨款进行整修建设。去年１１月９日，专门陈列这些稀世奇珍的法门寺博物馆建成开放，１３层、４９米高的真身宝塔也于同日重建竣工。
    尽管开放期间时值隆冬，但每天从四面八方赶来的观瞻者仍排成长长的队，最多的一天达到５万人。
    许多参观者在观看了法门寺稀世珍宝后，为中华民族的灿烂历史文化感到骄傲。去年１２月２日，来自佛祖释迦牟尼故乡的印度５位新闻界人士，在观瞻时连连竖起大拇指，并在留言簿上写道：“法门寺的珍宝出土，是中国古文化艺术的再现。”
