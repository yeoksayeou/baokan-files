The Railroad Corps, after being transferred to the Ministry of Railways on New Year's Day 1984, has adhered to the spirit of hard work, fearlessly facing sacrifices and difficulties in construction. Over the past five years, they have completed 6 railways and over 100 other projects, receiving multiple commendations from party and state leaders.

The 170,000-strong Railroad Corps, after collective transfer, was reorganized into the Railway Engineering Command under the Ministry of Railways. The 10 divisions were transformed into 10 engineering bureaus, continuing to undertake railway construction and other infrastructure tasks in border, forest, and mountainous regions.

Over the past five years, the Railway Engineering Command has undertaken the construction and technical renovation of 15 railways in China, including 6 national key projects. These railways pass through sparsely populated areas with harsh environments. The broad masses of workers have worked tirelessly, completing the final and complementary projects of the Qinghai-Tibet Railway (Haergai to Golmud), the Southern Xinjiang Railway (Tulufan to Kuerle), and the Tong-Huo Railway (Tongliao to Hulinhe Coal Mine). They have also built the Yan-Shi Railway (Yanzhou to Shiyousuo), the Yi-Min Railway (Inner Mongolia's Hailar to Yi-Min Coal Mine), and the Ta-Han Railway (Tahe in Heilongjiang to Hanjiayuanzi). Additionally, they are currently undertaking the construction of 9 railways, including the Da-Qin, Bao-Shen, Shang-Fu, and Tong-Pu, all of which are progressing at a relatively fast pace. During the construction of the Da-Qin Railway, the workers of this system have set national records for double-track tunnel construction three times.

While undertaking railway construction, this force has also undertaken over 200 national and local engineering projects in 27 provinces and cities, including building highways, ports, airports, and high-rise buildings. Among the over 100 completed projects, 4 have received gold and silver awards from the state, and 8 have been rated as excellent projects by the Ministry of Railways.

　　保持光荣传统不忘艰苦奋斗
    铁道兵转业５年建成６条铁路
    本报讯  铁道兵部队自１９８４年元旦并入铁道部以来，坚持艰苦奋斗，在施工中不怕牺牲、不畏艰难，５年建成６条铁路和其它１００多项工程，多次受到党和国家领导人的表扬。　　
    拥有１７万官兵的铁道兵部队集体转业后，改为铁道部工程指挥部。下属的１０个师改成１０个工程局，继续在边疆、林海和山区担负铁路施工等基建任务。
    ５年来，工程指挥部系统担负了我国１５条铁路建设和技术改造任务，其中有６条是国家重点工程。这些铁路的沿线人烟稀少，环境恶劣，广大职工艰苦拚搏，先后完成了青藏铁路（哈尔盖——格尔木）、南疆铁路（吐鲁番——库尔勒）和通霍铁路（通辽——霍林河煤矿）的收尾配套工程，建成了兖石铁路（兖州——石臼所）、伊敏铁路（内蒙古海拉尔——伊敏煤矿）和塔韩铁路（黑龙江塔河——韩家园子）。此外，他们目前承担的大秦、包神、商阜以及同蒲等９条铁路的施工都以较快的速度进行。在大秦铁路施工中，这个系统的职工先后３次创造我国双线隧道施工的全国纪录。
    这支队伍在担负了铁路施工的同时，还在全国２７个省市承担铺公路、建码头、修机场、盖高楼等２００多项国家或地方的工程施工任务。在建成的１００多项工程中，有４项工程荣获国家颁发的金质奖和银质奖，８项工程被铁道部评为优质工程。
