The recently stolen murals from Mogao Cave No. 465 in Dunhuang are extremely valuable.

According to the State Administration of Cultural Heritage, Cave No. 465 is one of only two Yuan Dynasty caves in Dunhuang and the only one that reflects the style of Tibetan Buddhism murals. The cave is divided into front and rear chambers, and its scale is several times larger than that of the third Yuan Dynasty cave. Unfortunately, Cave No. 465 is located at the northernmost end of Mogao Caves, far from the central area where most caves are concentrated and where security is strong and visitors can currently tour. There are few caves with cultural relics remaining in that area, and most of the caves were not painted after being excavated. Over the years, they have been eroded by wind and sand, with few visitors. Only during the annual pilgrimage do locals stay there. The previously stolen Cave No. 464 is also in this area, but by the time the theft was discovered, it had been a long time since the actual crime, and all traces of the theft had been erased.

After the theft of Cave No. 465 was discovered on January 14, the director of the Dunhuang Academy immediately reported it to Beijing, and the State Administration of Cultural Heritage urgently reported the matter to State Councilor Li Tieying and Minister of Culture Wang Meng on January 16. The report stated: "The scene has clear footprints, and preliminary analysis indicates that the crime was committed one or two days ago..."

According to the cultural relics protection department of the State Administration of Cultural Heritage, the anti-theft technology investment in Mogao Caves is unparalleled in the country. The Ministry of Public Security and the State Administration of Cultural Heritage have invested 1.1 million yuan to strengthen the security of Dunhuang cultural relics. The first phase of the project has been completed recently and is currently being debugged. The thieves took advantage of this gap.

### 敦煌失窃乃珍贵元窟  反映藏传佛教风格壁画唯此窟有

　　敦煌失窃乃珍贵元窟
    反映藏传佛教风格壁画唯此窟有
    本报北京１月１７日讯  记者齐欣报道：日前被盗的敦煌莫高窟４６５号洞窟壁画，其文物价值极其珍贵。
    据国家文物局介绍，４６５是敦煌仅有的两个元代洞窟之一，也是那里唯一反映藏传佛教风格的壁画洞，洞窟分前后两室，其规模要比第三号元代窟大数倍。遗憾的是，４６５洞位于莫高窟的最北端，远离洞窟集中且警卫力量强、目前可供人参观的中心区域。那里尚有文物遗存的洞窟已很稀少，多数洞穴当年开凿后，并未进行彩绘。常年风吹沙埋，游人罕至，只有每年百姓进香寄居于此。上次被窃的４６４号洞窟也在这里，但发现失盗时距实际作案时间已久，所有盗窃痕迹都已湮灭。
    ４６５于本月１４日发现被窃后，当晚敦煌研究院院长即电告北京，国家文物局于１６日将此事紧急呈报给国务委员李铁映和文化部长王蒙。报告称：“现场脚印清楚，初步分析是一、二天内作案……”
    据国家文物局文物保卫部门介绍，莫高窟的技术防盗投资在全国首屈一指。公安部和国家文物局为加强敦煌文物的安全保卫，已投资１１０万元。第一期工程已于近期完成，正在进行调试，盗贼乘此钻了空子。
