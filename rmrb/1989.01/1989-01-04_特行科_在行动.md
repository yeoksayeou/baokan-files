The Special Operations Unit in Action

At 00:15 on December 27th of last year, the streets of the capital were quiet, and people who had been working hard had mostly gone to sleep. Suddenly, a gray car screeched to a halt in front of the Hademen Hotel in Chongwen District. Three young men jumped out of the car and rushed up to the manager's office on the third floor of the hotel.

These three men were from the Special Operations Unit of the Chongwen District Public Security Bureau, led by Deputy Director Liu Zongqi. They had received a report that a self-employed individual from Inner Mongolia claimed to have been swindled out of 7,000 yuan, and the swindler, Wu, was staying in this hotel.

Wu, dressed in a neat suit, was escorted into the manager's office. With a purple-red tie and a shiny gold ring, he had a self-satisfied expression. After several rounds of questioning, Wu finally hung his head in defeat. This driver from a certain financial bureau in Inner Mongolia had lied about being a business representative from a certain machinery and electrical company. A week earlier, he had met a self-employed individual from his hometown who was eager to buy a car and swindled 7,000 yuan in cash from him. He had spent 3,000 yuan in just a few days on seafood and foreign goods. The next day, he was planning to slip away to Guangzhou to "make a fortune."

"Where do you plan to use the money you swindled?" Liu asked sternly.

"I'll return it, I'll return it..." Wu stammered.

The phone rang. It was from the Longtan First Hotel. Officer Zhao, who was checking the security situation at the hotel, reported to Liu that they had found suspicious clues. Liu instructed Officer He to stay at the Hademen Hotel to continue handling the case and invited the reporter to join them in the car.

It was now 1:30 AM, and the north wind mixed with snowflakes blew into the car. The reporter asked, "Do you always travel like this every night?"

Liu smiled and revealed the "secret": "You reporters want to do on-site interviews, so I managed to get a car. Normally, we don't have this luxury. We usually ride bicycles. Sometimes we hit potholes and end up with bruises. While others are warm in their beds, we might not be back home until 5 AM. We've gotten used to it."

"Are you married?"

"At 27, I'm still single. Which girl would want to marry a night owl like us!" Liu laughed heartily again.

Liu introduced that Chongwen District is located in the bustling center of Beijing, with over 200 hotels and restaurants. Visitors to Beijing often choose this "prime location" to stay, and criminals from other places also target this advantageous location. The Special Operations Unit, which is responsible for the public security management of various special industries such as hotels, recycling, and small item storage in the entire district, is even busier. They have handled hundreds of cases and apprehended over a hundred criminals just last year.

The reporter had also heard stories about the Special Operations Unit from other comrades. Last summer, on a night with a hazy sky, two young women were selling train tickets illegally in front of a certain hotel. Seeing the Special Operations Unit officers, one of the ticket scalpers approached. With her oily long hair, flattering smile, overpowering perfume, and coquettish voice, she said, "Officer, please let us pass. What do you want? I'll give it to you." The temptation of money and beauty did not sway the officer. He sternly reprimanded the two ticket scalpers, confiscated their illegal earnings of 3,000 yuan in cash, and sent them to the Public Security Bureau for detention.

Our conversation had not yet ended when the car stopped in front of the Longtan First Hotel. Liu quickly climbed the steps and entered the underground hotel, which was like an air-raid shelter. The long corridor echoed with hurried footsteps...

　　“特行科”在行动
    舒瑜　齐纪民
    去年１２月２７日零点１５分，首都街市一片寂静，紧张劳作后的人们大多已经入睡。突然，一辆灰色的轿车嘎地一声停在崇文区哈德门饭店门前。从车里钻出来３个小伙子，急匆匆奔上饭店３楼的经理室。
    这３人来自崇文区公安分局“特行科”，带队的是副科长刘宗琦。他们接到报告：一位从内蒙古来的个体户声称被骗走７０００元人民币，骗钱者吴某就住在这个饭店里。
    穿着笔挺西装的吴某被“请”进经理室，紫红色的领带，金闪闪的戒指，一副踌躇满志的神情。几经盘问，吴某终于颓丧地垂下了头。这个来自内蒙古某财政局的司机，谎称是某机电公司业务员，一周前在饭店里认识了急于购车的某个体户“老乡”，骗取现金７０００元。他吃海味，购洋货，几天内就花掉３０００元。翌日正准备溜到广州“发财”。
    “骗来的钱咋办？”小刘厉声问道。
    “我退，我退……”吴某哆嗦着回答。
    电话铃响了，是从龙潭第一旅馆打来的。在旅馆检查治安情况的民警小赵向小刘报告，那里发现了可疑线索。小刘吩咐民警小何留在哈德门饭店继续处理案件，并邀请记者随车前去。
    这时已是凌晨１点３０分，北风夹着雪花吹到车窗里。记者问：“你们每晚都这样乘车转来转去么？”小刘笑着道出“秘密”：“你们记者要实地采访，我才弄来一部车，平常哪有这福气，往来都是蹬自行车。有时遇上坑坑洼洼，没准儿摔个鼻青脸肿。人家躺在暖和和的被窝里，我们到了早上５点还回不了家。我们已经习惯了。”
    “你成家了么？”
    “如今２７岁还是光棍一条。哪个姑娘愿意找我们这些夜猫子！”小刘又爽朗地笑了起来。
    小刘介绍说，崇文区位于北京繁华的中心地带，仅旅店、饭店就有２００多个。进京的客人往往选择这块“宝地”投宿，外地的案犯也瞄准这个有利目标。担负全区旅店、回收、小件寄存等项特种行业治安管理工作的“特行科”就更忙了。仅去年以来，他们已处理各种案件数百起，抓获案犯上百人。
    “特行科”的故事，记者也听其他同志谈论过。去年夏天一个夜色朦胧的晚上，两个姑娘正在某旅社门口倒卖火车票。见到特行科民警，一个女票贩子迎了上来。油光的长发，谄媚的笑脸，袭人的香粉味儿，嗲声嗲气的浪调儿：“民警同志，高抬一下贵手让我们过去。你要什么，我都给你。”金钱与美色的诱惑，没有使这位民警动心。他严厉地斥责了两名女票贩子，没收了她们非法所得的３０００元现款，并扭送到公安分局予以拘留处理。
    我们的谈话还未结束，车子就在龙潭第一旅馆门口停住了。小刘迅速登上台阶，又钻进防空洞般的地下旅店。长长的通道里，响起了一阵阵急促的脚步声……
