The Spring Festival is approaching, and strengthening fire prevention work during the holiday season is once again on the agenda. According to statistics from our bureau, in recent years, more than 1,000 fires have occurred nationwide during the Spring Festival, resulting in over 100 deaths and economic losses of tens of millions of yuan. In 1987, we conducted a survey in Beijing and nine other cities and found that in these 10 cities, 852 fire alarms were triggered by people setting off firecrackers during the festival, with 50 of these incidents resulting in fires. A total of 2,115 people were injured by fireworks and firecrackers.

	Before the 1988 Spring Festival, some news organizations issued appeals, calling on relevant departments to strengthen the management of fireworks and firecrackers. Various regions also issued relevant fire prevention regulations for the holidays. These measures were effective, reducing the number of fire alarms and losses.

	We believe that production and sales units for fireworks and firecrackers should strictly control the quantity and types of these products, especially those that are easily harmful to people or likely to cause fires, which should be immediately stopped from being produced and sold. Parents should also educate their children about the dangers of setting off firecrackers. Additionally, each region should formulate and improve relevant regulations for the safe use of fireworks and firecrackers based on local conditions. We wish for more joy and fewer fires during the holidays.

### 愿春节多点欢乐，少点火灾

　　愿春节多点欢乐，少点火灾
    春节即将来临，加强节日防火工作又提到了日程。据我局统计，近几年来，全国每年春节期间发生火灾１０００多起，造成百余人死亡，上千万元的经济损失。１９８７年春节，我们对北京等１０个城市作了调查，发现这１０个城市中因一些人在节日燃放爆竹引起的火警有８５２起，成灾５０起。被烟花爆竹炸伤的有２１１５人。
    １９８８年春节前夕，一些新闻单位发出呼吁，要求有关部门加强花炮管理，各地也颁发了有关节日防火法规。这种做法果然奏效，火警次数少了，损失也少了。
    我们认为，产销花炮的单位应严格控制花炮的数量、品种，尤其是那些容易伤人、容易引起火灾的品种，应立即停止生产和销售；家长们也要教育孩子，让他们认识燃放鞭炮的危害性。同时，各地区还应结合实际，制定和健全有关燃放花炮的法规。愿节日多一点欢乐，少一点火灾。
