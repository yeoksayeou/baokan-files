Educational and psychological experts in Beijing, Shandong, and Guangxi have conducted research proving that the temperament of adolescents and children is directly influenced by the family's cultural structure.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Jinan on January 5th, "The gender and urban-rural differences in the temperament types of adolescents and children are mainly determined by social environmental factors. The quality of the family's cultural structure directly influences the temperament of adolescents and children." After analyzing the temperament characteristics of over 1,400 middle and primary school students in Beijing, Shandong, and Guangxi, Chinese educators and psychologists have issued this warning to parents and educators of adolescents and children.

This research, titled "Cooperative Research on the Distribution and Development of Temperament in Chinese Children," through the study of the external behaviors of 10 temperament types in adolescents and children, shows that social environmental factors have a very close relationship with the formation and development of temperament in adolescents and children. According to the survey, in Chinese male adolescents and children, the proportion of choleric and sanguine-choleric types is significantly higher than in females. In urban and rural adolescents and children, the proportion of sanguine and sanguine-choleric types in urban adolescents and children is significantly higher than in rural adolescents and children. Melancholic and phlegmatic-melancholic types are more common in female adolescents and children and rural adolescents and children. The four typical temperament types of choleric, sanguine, phlegmatic, and melancholic adolescents and children account for approximately 53% of the total number of adolescents and children in China.

The survey shows that in families with higher educational levels in urban and rural areas, the proportion of choleric, sanguine, and sanguine-choleric types is significantly higher than in families with lower educational levels. In families with lower educational levels, melancholic types are more common. After a comprehensive analysis of the temperament types of adolescents and children, experts have concluded that parents with higher cultural qualities have a positive influence on the formation and development of their children's temperament characteristics.

The examination results of the academic performance of adolescents and children of various temperament types show that students of the sanguine-choleric and sanguine-phlegmatic types have significantly better academic performance than those of the melancholic and choleric-melancholic types.

There is no insurmountable gap between different temperament types. When examining the relationship between academic performance and temperament types, experts found that the differences in academic performance among adolescents and children of different temperament types are not only determined by their temperament characteristics but also influenced by their interaction with the environment. Experts advise parents and educators of adolescents and children to provide a better educational environment for adolescents and children with relatively disadvantaged temperament types to "optimize" the temperament structure of the next generation.

The survey, led by the Shandong Provincial Educational Research Institute, is a sub-project of the national key research project "Chinese Children's Psychological Development and Education" and has recently passed the national appraisal.

　　教育和心理专家在北京山东广西调查证明
    家庭文化结构直接影响少年儿童气质
    据新华社济南１月５日电  （记者侯严峰）“少年儿童气质类型中的性别差异及城乡差异，主要决定于社会环境因素。家庭文化结构的优劣直接影响少年儿童的气质”。我国教育和心理学家在对北京、山东、广西的１４００多名中小学生气质特征调查分析后，向家长及少儿教育工作者提出这番忠告。
    这项称作“中国儿童的气质分布与发展协作研究”的调查，通过对１０种气质类型的少年儿童气质外显行为的研究，表明社会环境因素与少儿气质形成和发展有十分密切的关系。据调查，我国男性少年儿童中，胆汁质和胆汁多血质类型所占比例，明显高于女性；城乡少年儿童中，多血质和胆汁多血质类型的城市少年儿童所占比例，明显高于乡村。抑郁质和粘液抑郁质类型，则多见于女性少年儿童和乡村少年儿童。胆汁质、多血质、粘液质、抑郁质４种典型气质类型的少年儿童，约占我国少年儿童总数的５３％。
    调查表明，我国城乡文化程度高的子女中，胆汁质、多血质和胆汁多血质类型的，明显多于文化程度低的子女；文化程度低的子女中，则以抑郁质类型的居多。对少儿气质类型综合分析后，专家们得出如下结论：文化素质高的父母，对子女气质特点的形成和发展有积极影响。
    各种气质类型少年儿童的学业成绩考察结果则证实，胆汁多血质和多血粘液质类型的学生，学业成绩优秀者，明显多于抑郁质和胆汁抑郁质类型的学生。
    不同气质类型之间并不存在不可逾越的鸿沟。专家们在考察学业成绩与气质类型的关系时发现，不同气质类型少年儿童学业成绩的差异，不仅决定于他们的气质特点，而且受他们与环境双向作用的影响。专家们忠告家长和少儿教育工作者，对气质类型相对劣势的少年儿童，要提供更为良好的教育环境，以“优化”下一代的气质结构。
    以山东省教育研究所为主开展的这项调查，是国家重点科研项目“中国儿童心理发展与教育”中的子项目，日前通过了国家鉴定。
