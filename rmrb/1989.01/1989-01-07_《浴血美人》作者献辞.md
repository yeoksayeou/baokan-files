My work "Blood Bath Beauty" has been translated by my friends Dong Chun and Shen Dalì, and will be performed by the China Youth Art Theatre. This fills me with great joy. The fact that this play will be staged in China, a country with a long theatrical tradition, and on the renowned stage of the China Youth Art Theatre, makes me feel a sense of pride. In recent years, Peking Opera has frequently performed in Paris, and I was deeply moved by the performances, which I will never forget. Today, by a fortunate coincidence, I eagerly look forward to seeing the transformation of "Blood Bath Beauty."

The tragedy of "Blood Bath Beauty" is based on a true social news story. At the end of the 16th century, Countess Erzsébet Báthory, the cousin of the King of Hungary, was accused of luring hundreds of young girls into her castle and torturing them to death. During her interrogation, the countess revealed that she had used human blood to bathe and anoint her body. This was because one of her maids, who was somewhat versed in witchcraft, claimed that bathing in blood could prevent aging and preserve youthful beauty.

This story is reminiscent of a legend or a strange tale, recalling the bloodthirsty Count Dracula known to film enthusiasts, or Gilles de Rais, who was associated with Joan of Arc and was burned at the stake for similar crimes. However, Erzsébet differed from her two famous predecessors. She had a unique character, seeking eternity, and became a mythical figure. Indeed, she was an evil Faust, tormented by time and death, who sold her soul to the devil in exchange for eternal youth.

At that time, feudal society had little reaction to Erzsébet's actions. As long as the countess was killing poor girls, she faced no criticism. However, when she threatened the noble ladies, public opinion erupted, and the king personally came to question her, not allowing his cousin to continue her evil deeds.

"Blood Bath Beauty" depicts the scene of King Matthias interrogating Erzsébet in her castle. The defendant admits everything without hesitation. Furthermore, she accuses the king, causing him to be full of contradictions... On one hand, Erzsébet frequently clashes with Matthias, and on the other hand, this beauty, with the help of her servants, reenacts a series of bloody and absurd dramas in front of the enforcing monarch. Thus, the past and the present, reality and imagination, repeatedly alternate, and the language creates a dramatic atmosphere and poetic imagery, leading the audience into a world of universal significance. There is no need for detailed description, or only a light touch is needed. The important thing is to arouse people's thoughts. Therefore, the language flows like music, making one read and listen as if it were a symphony score.

I humbly hope that "Blood Bath Beauty" will arouse the interest and passion of Chinese audiences. Here, I sincerely express my greetings to you all. There is no doubt that the current efforts of the China Youth Art Theatre will further strengthen the friendly cultural ties that already exist between France and China, and between the peoples of the two countries. For me personally, if I can make a small contribution to this through "Blood Bath Beauty," it would be a great honor.

　　《浴血美人》作者献辞
    〔法〕克洛德·普兰
    拙作《浴血美人》经董纯和沈大力二位友人译出，将由中国青年艺术剧院公演，十分令人欣慰。此剧能引入具有久远戏剧传统的中国，搬上闻名遐迩的青年艺术剧院舞台，使我充满了自豪感。近年来，京剧屡来巴黎吐艳，我观后激情荡怀，终生难忘。今日机缘凑巧，我急盼一睹《浴》剧换颜。
    《浴血美人》的悲剧系源于一则真实的社会新闻。十六世纪末，匈牙利国王的表妹艾丝蓓塔·巴托里伯爵夫人被控将数百名少女骗至其古堡内，一个个折磨致死。审讯中，女伯爵透露她曾取人血敷面抹身。因为，她的一名侍女略通巫术，声言浴血能防衰老，永葆美貌。
    这故事颇似一个传说，或者一则志怪轶闻，让人想起电影迷所熟知的嗜血魔王德哈古拉伯爵，或吉尔·德莱；后者曾与圣女贞德为伴，因犯类似罪行被处以火刑。不过，艾丝蓓塔与其两位著名前辈有所不同。她别具标格，渴求永恒，成了荒诞的神话。确实，这是个邪恶的浮士德，因受时光和死神困扰，把灵魂卖给了魔鬼，以求永不老朽。
    当时的封建社会对艾丝蓓塔的营生无甚反应，这个现象值得深思。只要伯爵夫人残杀的是贫女，她就不遭人非议。可是，一旦她危及到贵族闺秀，就舆论大哗，国王亲临问罪，不许她表妹再继续作祟。
    《浴血美人》一剧展现的正是玛蒂亚斯国王在古堡审讯艾丝蓓塔的场景。被告供认一切，毫不推诿。进而，她指斥国王，使之矛盾百出……一方面，艾丝蓓塔与玛蒂亚斯频频交锋，另一方面，这位美人由其仆从配合，在执法君主面前，重演了一出出血淋淋的荒唐剧。这样就形成了过去与现在，真实与想象的反复更迭，而语言创造了戏剧的气氛和诗的意境，把观众引入一个有普遍意义的寓言世界。无须绘形绘色，或者只需轻描淡写，重要的在于唤起人们的思索。因此，语流淙淙，仿佛音乐一般，让人读来听去犹如一本交响乐总谱。
    我不揣冒昧，期望《浴血美人》一剧能引起中国观众的兴趣和激情。在此，我谨向诸君表达作者最诚挚的问候。毋庸置疑，中国青年艺术剧院目前的作为将会进一步加强法中两国和两国人民之间已有的友好文化联系。就个人而言，如果我能通过《浴》剧对此做出微薄的贡献，那将是一大幸事。　　　（董纯译）
