The Chengdu Third Grain and Oil Food Company violated national grain supply policies by arbitrarily using standard-priced grain for production, allowing its affiliated grain and oil food factory to produce and sell negotiated-price instant noodles, thereby profiting illegally.

Recently, the Chengdu Price Inspection Bureau confiscated its illegal earnings of over 150,000 yuan and imposed a fine of 200,000 yuan.

In 1987, the company illegally allocated 454,000 kilograms of standard-priced first-grade flour and over 300,000 kilograms of bran to the grain and oil food factory. The factory then exchanged the bran for wheat, which was processed into first-grade flour and regular flour. All the first-grade flour was used to produce instant noodles, while the regular flour and instant noodles were sold at negotiated prices, earning a total of over 150,000 yuan in price differentials.

It is understood that the Chengdu Supervision Bureau will take appropriate disciplinary actions against the relevant responsible parties in the Third Grain and Oil Food Company and the Chengdu Grain Bureau.

　　用平价粮套取国家差价款
    成都第三粮油食品公司被查处
    新华社成都电  （记者师文宴）成都市第三粮油食品公司违反国家粮食供应政策，擅自动用平价粮食，给所属粮油食品厂加工生产议价方便面出售从中牟利。
    成都市物价检查所最近没收其非法所得１５万多元外，并处以罚款２万元。
    １９８７年度，这个公司先后挪用平价特级面粉４５．４万多公斤指标和３０多万公斤麦麸指标给粮油食品厂。该厂将麦麸兑换成小麦，再加工成特级面粉和普通面粉，特粉全部加工成方便面。普通面粉和方便面全按议价销售，共牟取差价款１５万多元。
    据悉，成都市监察局将对第三粮油食品公司和成都市粮食局的有关责任者作出相应的政纪处分。
