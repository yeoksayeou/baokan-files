　　健美新星——杨新民
    烟台市劳动模范、市第二汽车运输公司四队修理工杨新民，是山东省著名业余健美运动员，在近几年的全国健美大赛中，他６次金榜题名，被誉为我国的健美新星。
    杨新民练健美是从１９８４年开始的。当时他已３５岁，练习中，没有资料，他就自学《人体解剖学》、《美学》、《运动学》等书籍，为了使身体变得轻灵、协调，他经常去舞场观摩和实践。使用的器材，都是利用废旧材料焊接而成的。１９８５年他参加山东省第二届健美比赛，一举夺得了两枚金牌。
    杨新民身体线条明朗，造型优美，音乐节奏感强，加上肌肉发达，比赛中能充分体现健美运动员所具有的健、力、美特点。在全国健美赛中，他接连夺魁。１９８７年在北京“长城杯”全国健美精英赛中，他夺得８０公斤级第一名，首次登上全国冠军宝座，成为山东省第一个全国健美冠军。事隔两月，在济南“信息杯”全国精英健美比赛中，技压群雄，夺得８０公斤级和全场冠军赛两枚金牌，令人刮目相看。金秋１０月，他远征安徽屯溪，角逐“力士杯”，又一次折桂。接着，又马不停蹄赴淄博参加全国健美冠军大赛，再夺８０公斤级金牌。
