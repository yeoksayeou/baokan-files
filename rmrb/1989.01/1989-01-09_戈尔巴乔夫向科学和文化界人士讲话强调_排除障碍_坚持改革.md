Soviet leader Gorbachev said, "Reform is very necessary for us," and "no matter what happens, we should not deviate from the path of reform."

According to a report by TASS this evening, Gorbachev delivered a lengthy speech to scientists and cultural figures on January 6, focusing on refuting various doubts about the reforms and discussing economic and social issues.

Gorbachev said that the past four years have convincingly shown that the Soviet people firmly support reform and the revitalization of society. At the same time, various doubts and views have emerged. He pointed out that in the stormy process of reform, many new problems have arisen, and it is difficult to solve them. Therefore, some people say that we lack a strategic and tactical plan for reform, as if we do not know how to proceed and what to do. But this is groundless. He welcomed debates on some issues related to the reform.

When discussing the current social and economic situation, Gorbachev said that many people not only criticize the shortages of goods and food, housing shortages, and inadequate services but also directly link these shortcomings to the reform, as if the reform has brought no benefits to the economy and society, and many aspects have even worsened. He explained that this situation did not suddenly arise but has a series of causes. The heaviest burden inherited from the past is the budget deficit. Over the past 20 years, the growth rate of residents' monetary income has exceeded the growth rate of commodity production. There were also errors in the strategic sequence of arranging the five-year plans. Agriculture was not given due attention. From 1985 to 1988, due to the drop in oil prices, 37 billion rubles were lost in revenue. During the same period, the anti-alcohol campaign resulted in a loss of 49 billion rubles in revenue. The Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident, the Armenian earthquake, and the Afghan war also consumed a large amount of money. In addition, some production sectors failed to complete their plans, exacerbating the tension in market supply. He revealed that the Politburo of the CPSU Central Committee will soon discuss these issues with the government and financial leaders.

Gorbachev said that this year will be a crucial stage for implementing fundamental economic reforms. All material production sectors will fully transition to economic accounting and self-financing. He called on people to take action to remove all obstacles hindering these efforts. To reverse the deficit and balance fiscal revenue and expenditure, he believed that the Soviet Union could reduce military spending without affecting national security and defense capabilities.

In discussing the adjustment of party cadres, he revealed that so far, about 60% of the members of district and city party committees have been replaced, more than half of the members of regional and border area party committees have been replaced, and one-third of the grassroots party organization secretaries have been elected for the first time.

　　戈尔巴乔夫向科学和文化界人士讲话强调
    排除障碍　坚持改革
    新华社莫斯科１月７日电  苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫说，“改革对我们来说十分必要”，“不管发生什么情况，我们都不应当离开改革道路”。
    据塔斯社今晚报道，戈尔巴乔夫６日向科学和文化界人士发表长篇讲话，着重批驳了对改革的各种怀疑论调，并阐述了经济和社会等问题。
    戈尔巴乔夫说，最近４年的情况令人信服地证明，苏联人民坚决主张改革和振兴社会。同时也出现了种种怀疑的想法和看法。他指出，在暴风雨般的改革进程中，产生了许多新问题，而且很难解决。于是有人就说我们没有改革的战略和策略，仿佛我们不知道怎样走下去和做些什么。但这种说法是没有根据的。他表示欢迎就改革中的一些问题展开辩论。
    谈到当前社会和经济状况时，戈尔巴乔夫说，许多人不仅批评商品和食品短缺、住房紧张和服务不足，而且还把这些缺点同改革直接联系起来，仿佛改革在经济和社会领域什么好处也没有带来，许多方面甚至更加恶化了。他解释说，这种情况并不是突然产生的，而有一系列原因。从过去接过来的摊子中最感沉重的是预算赤字。最近２０年中居民的货币收入增长速度超过了商品生产。在安排各个五年计划时战略次序上也有错误。对农业没有给予应有的重视。１９８５—１９８８年期间由于石油跌价，少收入３７０亿卢布。同一时期因反酗酒少收入４９０亿卢布。切尔诺贝利核电站事故和亚美尼亚地震以及阿富汗战争也耗去大量钱财。此外，一些生产部门没有完成计划，也加剧了市场供应状况的紧张。他透露，苏共中央政治局最近将会同政府和财经界领导人讨论有关上述的问题。
    戈尔巴乔夫说，今年对贯彻根本经济改革将是十分重要的阶段。所有物质生产部门完全转入经济核算和自筹资金。他要求人们行动起来扫除阻挠开展这些工作的一切障碍。为了扭转赤字，平衡财政收支，他认为在不影响国家安全和防御能力的情况下，苏联可以削减军费开支。
    他在谈及党内干部调整情况时透露，至今约有６０％的区和城市的党委成员已经更新，一半以上的州和边疆区党委成员被替换。１／３的基层党组织书记首次通过选举产生。
