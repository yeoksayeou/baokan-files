By the end of December last year, all outstanding subsidies for private teachers in Fuxin Mongol Autonomous County, Liaoning Province, had been fully repaid, allowing the county's 2,000 teachers to enjoy a peaceful New Year.

County Magistrate He Wentian took responsibility for the delayed subsidies to private teachers and voluntarily reduced his salary. (Starting in December, He Wentian and County Party Secretary Xing Heying each took only 50% of their salary, and simultaneously announced that if any township still owed subsidies to private teachers by the end of December, the township head and party secretary would also have their salaries reduced until the issue was resolved. For more details, see the report on page three of our newspaper on December 26 last year.)

After this matter was reported in the newspaper, Provincial Party Secretary Quan Shuren made a directive. The county party committee and government proposed four measures: first, villages with surplus production should pay the collective retention funds in full and distribute them to private teachers; second, the county should advance the agricultural tax contract portion to townships (towns) to be used as educational funds; third, each township's administrative funds or profits from township-run enterprises could be temporarily used to pay private teachers' salaries; fourth, the Agricultural Bank could provide temporary loans. As a result, by the end of last year, the 47,000-plus yuan in subsidies owed to private teachers was fully repaid, not a penny short.

　　阜新拖欠民办教师补贴
    县里采取措施全部还清
    新华社沈阳１月８日电  到去年１２月３１日，辽宁省阜新蒙古族自治县拖欠民办教师补贴款已全部还清，全县两千名教师过了一个舒心的新年。
    阜新县县长何文田就拖欠民办教师补贴款引咎自责，主动减领工资一事（从１２月起，何文田与县委书记邢鹤龄只领取工资的５０％，还同时宣布：到１２月末，哪个乡仍拖欠民办教师补贴款，乡长和书记也要减发工资，直到解决为止——详见本报去年１２月２６日三版报道）在报上公开报道之后，省委书记全树仁做了批示。县委、县政府提出４条措施：一，丰产村集体提留款一次性交齐，如数兑现给民办教师；二，县里提前将农业税包干分成部分退给乡（镇），用作教育经费；三，各乡机关经费或乡办企业利润留成，可暂垫付作民办教师的报酬；四，农业银行给予临时贷款。结果，到去年岁尾，原欠民办教师４．７万多元的补贴款一分不少全部兑现。
