On November 22, 1988, some village cadres from my town took two cars to Tanggou Village in Tongshan County, Jiangsu Province, to observe village and town planning. On the way to Xuzhou for lunch, the cars stopped at the Xuzhou East Station parking lot. As soon as the cars came to a halt, the parking lot staff confiscated the driver's license. When the driver asked why, the response was: "Vehicles should enter from the south gate and exit from the north gate. You entered from the north gate, so you will be fined at least 80 yuan." With that, the staff member issued an 80 yuan fine.

What is puzzling is why the entrance and exit of this parking lot do not have any signs? I saw many drivers from out of town being fined.

　　进错一个门罚款８０元
    １９８８年１１月２２日，我镇一些村干部乘两辆汽车前往江苏铜山县唐沟村参观村镇规划。途经徐州去吃午餐，汽车在徐州东站停车场刚停稳，场内工作人员上来就把司机的驾驶执照扣了。司机问为什么？回答说：“车辆应该从南门进，北门出。你们的车从北门进来，至少罚款８０元。”说着，这个工作人员便开了８０元的罚款单。
    令人不解的是，这个停车场的出口和入口为什么不设标志？我看到不少外地来徐州的司机都受了罚。
