Hungarian Prime Minister Nemeth Miklos said on January 1 in response to questions from radio and television journalists that the goal of the Hungarian government is to reform Hungarian society and implement a well-defined, comprehensive reform program.

The article published in the January 2 edition of the Hungarian News said that in recent times, Hungary has seen political and economic reforms progressing simultaneously, creating favorable conditions for Hungarian reforms. The article pointed out that Hungary began economic reforms in 1968, but one of the reasons it has not yet emerged from its difficulties to this day is that the reforms were not thorough and political reforms were not carried out simultaneously.

Nemeth believes that it is necessary to make good use of the current favorable international situation to accelerate Hungary's reforms. Hungary has no other choice but to take the path of deep reform and, through its own reforms, promote the reform of socialist countries.

　　匈牙利总理内梅特谈改革
    匈牙利政府总理内梅特·米克洛什一月一日在回答电台和电视台记者问时说，匈牙利政府的目标是革新匈牙利社会，执行既定的、周密的改革纲领。
    《匈牙利新闻报》二日刊登的这篇谈话说，最近一段时期匈牙利出现了政治改革和经济改革齐头并进的形势，这为匈牙利改革创造了有利条件。谈话指出，匈牙利自一九六八年就开始经济改革，但直到今天仍未摆脱困境的原因之一就是改革不彻底，政治改革没有同步进行。
    内梅特认为，必须很好地利用当前有利的国际形势来加速匈牙利的改革。匈牙利只有走深入改革之路，别无其他选择，并通过自身的改革来促进社会主义国家的改革。
