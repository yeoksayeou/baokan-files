World population statistics show that women have a longer average lifespan than men.

Recently, the medical community in the Federal Republic of Germany discussed this issue. Some doctors believe that the main reasons lie in the physiological differences between men and women: First, the human body has a pair of sex chromosomes, with women having XX and men having XY. The X chromosome carries several immune genes. If one of a woman's two X chromosomes is damaged by a virus, the other can compensate. Men, however, have only one X chromosome, and if it is damaged, there is no compensation. Second, women experience blood loss during childbirth and menstruation, which men do not. This blood loss phenomenon actually makes women's blood production more robust. Third, it is widely recognized that cardiovascular diseases have the highest mortality rate. Male sex hormones increase the substances that block blood vessels, thereby increasing the likelihood of cardiovascular diseases. Female sex hormones, on the other hand, protect blood vessels and capillaries, so women have fewer heart disease cases than men.

Another group of doctors agree with the above views but believe that social, psychological, and mental factors cannot be ignored: First, men who engage in heavy drinking and drug use are more common than women, and these bad habits seriously affect health. Second, men are more competitive and stubborn, often neglecting minor illnesses, which can lead to delayed treatment. Third, women are more likely to express sadness, fear, and anger outwardly, while men tend to smoke or drink when they are depressed. Fourth, women have stronger living abilities than men, while men find it more difficult to live alone after losing a spouse.

　　女性为何比男性长寿
    世界人口统计资料表明，女性的平均寿命比男性长。
    最近，联邦德国医学界就此进行探讨，一部分医生认为，其主要原因在于男女之间的生理差别：一、人体内的一对性染色体，女性是ＸＸ，男性是ＸＹ。Ｘ染色体上附有若干免疫基因，女性的两个Ｘ染色体如其中任何一个遭病毒破坏后，另一个可以及时补偿。而男性只具有一个Ｘ染色体，如遭受意外侵害时，则无法补偿。二、女性分娩和月经来潮时的失血为男性所无，女性这种失血现象反使女性的造血机能更为旺盛。三、全球公认目前死亡率最高的病症是心血管疾病。男人的性激素阻塞血管的物质增加了心血管病发生的可能性，而女人的性激素具有保护血管、脉管等作用，因而女性患心脏病者也少于男性。
    另一部分医生虽同意上述观点，但觉得决不能忽视社会、精神和心理等方面的因素：一、男性酗酒、吸毒的人比女性多，这些不良嗜好严重影响身体健康。二、男性好胜、逞强，一般小病不愿求治，结果小病拖大，耽误了治疗。三、女人容易将悲伤、惧怕、愤怒流露于外，而男人则不然，男人精神抑郁时更多的是抽烟或喝酒。四、女人的生活能力比男人强，而男人丧失配偶后，单独生活会感到困难较多。
