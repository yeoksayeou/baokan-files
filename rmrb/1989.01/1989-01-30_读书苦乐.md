	The Joy and Sorrow of Reading
	Yang Glow

	Reading and studying require hard work. To prepare for exams, write papers, or earn degrees, one must read diligently. Tao Yuanming loved reading. If he were alive today, he might struggle with university entrance exams, graduate school admissions, or the "TOEFL." I worry he might fail political economy, all because he "did not seek to understand deeply."

	I have been criticized for reading "to seek spiritual enjoyment." I had no choice but to admit my guilt. I also admit that I am not a diligent reader. However, "finding joy in it" does not mean seeking enjoyment. This can only be understood by those who know, and it is not something to be shared with outsiders.

	I feel that reading is like visiting people—“invisible” visits. To meet admired teachers or pay respects to famous scholars, one does not need to make appointments or fear disturbing the host. Open the book and enter the door, turn a few pages and enter the room; and one can visit frequently, at any time. If one does not understand, one can leave without saying goodbye, or find another expert to question. It does not matter if the person one wants to meet lives in the country or abroad, in the present or the past, in any field, or whether they are lecturing on serious topics or chatting casually. One can listen as much as one wants. One can respectfully listen to the disciples of Confucius recounting the master's teachings, or playfully ask, "If Mengzi, who always spoke of 'ren and yi,' were alive today, would he be an old Marxist-Leninist?" One can stay by Socrates' side as he faces execution, listening to his conversation with a friend; or one can question the Stoic Epictetus' "Golden Sayings." One can listen to the stories of past dynasties, or learn the most profound new theories or deliberately shocking views of the present. If the conversation is not to one's liking or the words are unpleasant, one can leave the stage, or even slam the door—close the book—no one will be offended. This is a rare freedom outside the world of books!

	In the pot hanging from the wall, there is another world with its own sun and moon. Every book—whether it is a novel, play, biography, travelogue, diary, or essay—has its own world, its own sun, moon, stars, and the people living in it. We do not need to rush to a certain place, buy tickets, and look at replicas or "lifelike" substitutes. Just open a book, enter the real scene, meet real people, and observe them intimately.

	What is said about "wanting to see a thousand miles, climb one more level"? We can see the other side of the earth beneath our feet, and reach it in an instant. Although ancient people compared books to "vast as the sea," the world of books is truly "the ends of the earth are as neighbors." This is not just a metaphor. The world is vast, but there are no barriers. The Buddha spoke of "three thousand great thousand worlds," which is extremely vast. The realm of books, however, includes the "present realm," the "past realm," and even the "future realm." It truly encompasses everything and penetrates the three realms. While we can stay at home, we can experience it at will and seek teachers at any time. Who says that readers have narrow vision, are ignorant of human nature, and do not care about world affairs? Here, one can gain rich experiences and meet people from different times and places. Frequent "visits" to the world of books can at least reduce some ignorance and increase some wisdom. We see dignified gentlemen who speak grandly, and we do not need to be intimidated, because even if they do not open their doors to let people in, we have been to the homes of their friends and know their true faces behind their pretenses. Once, I rode a car across the magnificent bridge over the Seine River in Paris and saw the poor people living under the bridge, picking up trash for a living and covering themselves with newspapers for warmth. It was not that my eyes could turn corners, but that I had visited that place before.

	Unfortunately, "visiting" can only be done "invisibly." The "invisible" body is still a mortal body. We do not have the Buddha's wisdom to see all the wisdom accumulated in the world over thousands of years at a glance, so we must always remember Zhuangzi's famous saying, "Life has limits, but knowledge does not." We are merely creatures that live and die in a day, crawling here and there in the world of books, sometimes encountering people we admire, hearing words we like, or gaining insights into questions we have in our hearts. It is like opening one's mind, and joyfully forgetting to speak. This "joy" should not be the same as "seeking enjoyment," should it?

　　读书苦乐
    杨绛
    读书钻研学问，当然得下苦功夫。为应考试、为写论文、为求学位，大概都得苦读。陶渊明好读书。如果他生于当今之世，要去考大学，或考研究院，或考什么“托福儿”，难免会有些困难吧？我只愁他政治经济学不能及格呢，这还不是因为他“不求甚解”。
    我曾挨过几下“棍子”，说我读书“追求精神享受”。我当时只好低头认罪。我也承认自己确实不是苦读。不过，“乐在其中”并不等于追求享受。这话可为知者言，不足为外人道也。
    我觉得读书好比串门儿——“隐身”的串门儿。要参见钦佩的老师或拜谒有名的学者，不必事前打招呼求见，也不怕搅扰主人。翻开书面就闯进大门，翻过几页就升堂入室；而且可以经常去，时刻去，如果不得要领，还可以不辞而别，或者另找高明，和他对质。不问我们要拜见的主人住在国内国外，不问他属于现代古代，不问他什么专业，不问他讲正经大道理或聊天说笑，都可以挨近前去听个足够。我们可以恭恭敬敬旁听孔门弟子追述夫子遗言，也不妨淘气地笑问“言必称‘亦曰仁义而已矣’的孟夫子”，他如果生在我们同一个时代，会不会是一位马列主义老先生呀？我们可以在苏格拉底临刑前守在他身边，听他和一位朋友谈话；也可以对斯多葛派伊匹克悌忒斯（Ｅｐｉｃｔｉｔｕｓ）的《金玉良言》思考怀疑。我们可以倾听前朝列代的遗闻逸事，也可以领教当代最奥妙的创新理论或有意惊人的故作高论。反正话不投机或言不入耳，不妨抽身退场，甚至砰一下推上大门——就是说，拍地合上书面——谁也不会嗔怪。这是书以外的世界里难得的自由！
    壶公悬挂的一把壶里，别有天地日月。每一本书——不论小说、戏剧、传记、游记、日记，以至散文诗词，都别有天地，别有日月星辰，而且还有生存其间的人物。我们很不必巴巴地赶赴某地，花钱买门票去看些仿造的赝品或“栩栩如生”的替身，只要翻开一页书，走入真境，遇见真人，就可以亲亲切切地观赏一番。
    说什么“欲穷千里目，更上一层楼”！我们连脚底下地球的那一面都看得见，而且顷刻可到。尽管古人把书说成“浩如烟海”，书的世界却是真正的“天涯若比邻”，这话绝不是唯心的比拟。世界再大也没有阻隔。佛说“三千大千世界”，可算大极了。书的境地呢，“现在界”还加上“过去界”，也带上“未来界”，实在是包罗万象，贯通三界。而我们却可以足不出户，在这里随意阅历，随时拜师求教。谁说读书人目光短浅，不通人情，不关心世事呢！这里可得到丰富的经历，可认识各时各地、多种多样的人。经常在书里“串门儿”，至少也可以脱去几分愚昧，多长几个心眼儿吧？我们看到道貌岸然、满口豪言壮语的大人先生，不必气馁胆怯，因为他们本人家里尽管没开放门户，没让人闯入，他们的亲友家我们总到过，认识他们虚架子后面的真嘴脸。一次我乘汽车驰过巴黎赛纳河上宏伟的大桥，我看到了栖息在大桥底下那群拣垃圾为生、盖报纸取暖的穷苦人。不是我眼睛能拐弯儿，只因为我曾到那个地带去串过门儿啊。
    可惜“串门”只能“隐身”，“隐”而犹存的“身”毕竟只是凡胎俗骨。我们没有如来佛的慧眼，把人世间几千年积累的智慧一览无余，只好时刻记住庄子“生也有涯而知也无涯”的名言。我们只是朝生暮死的虫豸（还不是孙大圣毫毛变成的蟭蟟虫儿），钻入书中世界，这边爬爬，那边停停，有时遇到心仪的人，听到惬意的话，或者对心上悬挂的问题偶有所得，就好比开了心窍，乐以忘言。这个“乐”和“追求享受”该不是一回事吧？
