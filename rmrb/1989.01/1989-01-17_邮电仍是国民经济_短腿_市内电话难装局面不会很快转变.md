Telecommunications Remain the "Short Leg" of the National Economy
Local Phone Installations Will Not Improve Quickly

BEIJING, Jan. 16 (Xinhua) -- According to information from the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, in 1989, the Ministry will provide a total of 6 billion yuan in postal and telecommunications services, an 11% increase from 1988. The Ministry will add 800,000 new local phone lines, activate 600,000 lines, and complete 12,000 long-distance circuits. Additionally, 16 million square meters of office space will be completed. Despite these efforts, the gap between the supply of communication services and societal demand will continue to widen. Relieving the communication bottleneck will be a long and arduous task.

In 1988, China's communication capacity saw significant growth. The automation level of the telecommunications network improved, with a 26.3% increase in postal and telecommunications services over the previous year, reaching a total of 5.4 billion yuan, the highest in history. During this year, 6 billion pieces of mail were delivered, 690 million long-distance calls were made, and 692,000 new local phone lines were installed. Public telex services were automated in 26 provincial capitals, and 431 cities were connected to the national long-distance automatic telephone network. There were over 240,000 direct-dial long-distance users, and 51 cities could dial 156 countries and regions directly. Additionally, new services such as international express mail, domestic express mail, and postal parcels developed rapidly and were well-received by users.

Despite 1988 being the year with the fastest growth and the most significant increase in comprehensive communication capabilities in China's postal and telecommunications history, societal demand for communications grew even faster. The supply-demand contradiction remains prominent. In particular, the issue of local phone installations, where the capacity of exchanges and lines cannot keep up with the increase in users, will persist for a considerable period. The situation of "difficulty in installing local phones" will continue to exist for some time.

　　邮电仍是国民经济“短腿”
    市内电话难装局面不会很快转变
    本报北京１月１６日讯  记者刘桂莲报道：记者从邮电部新闻发布会上获悉，１９８９年邮电部为社会提供邮电业务总量可达６０亿元，比１９８８年增长１１％，新增市内电话８０万门，投产６０万门，长途业务电路１．２万路，局房竣工１６０万平方米。尽管如此，通信服务的供给与社会需求之间的缺口还会越来越大，缓和通信紧张状况的路是漫长的，任务是艰巨的。
    １９８８年，我国通信能力有较大幅度增长，电信网的自动化水平有了新的提高，完成邮电业务总量比上年增长２６．３％，达到５４亿元，是历史上最高的一年。在这一年，邮递信函６０亿件，接通长话６．９亿次、净增市内电话６９．２万户，全国有２６个省会城市开通了公众电报的自动输报，有４３１个城市进入全国长途电话自动网，长途直拨用户达２４万多户，有５１个城市可以直拨１５６个国家和地区。此外，国际特快专递，国内特快专递、邮政快件等新开业务也发展很快，受到用户欢迎。
    尽管１９８８年是我国邮电业务发展最快、综合通信能力增加最多的一年，但是，社会对通信的需要增长更快，通信供需矛盾仍十分突出。特别是被人们关注的市内电话，交换机容量和线路的增加，赶不上用户的增加，“市内电话难装”的状况在相当长的时间内还会存在。
