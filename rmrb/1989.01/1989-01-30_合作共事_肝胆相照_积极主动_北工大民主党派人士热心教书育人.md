The Communist Party Committee of Beijing University of Technology values the proactive spirit and active role of democratic party members in teaching and education, as well as in democratic school management.

The university has over 60 democratic party members, 65% of whom are senior intellectuals. To ensure that democratic party members are informed about various aspects of the school and can participate in decision-making, the Party Committee has adopted multiple forms of communication, regular dialogues, and strengthened mutual communication, institutionalizing supervision and consultation. In the third week of each semester, the president and the Party secretary invite representatives from various democratic parties within the school to report on the semester's work arrangements and to listen to their opinions and suggestions. In early 1987, Beihang University established a decision-making advisory body—the School Affairs Committee. Professor Shi Guole, a standing committee member of the Jiusan Society at Beihang University, serves as the democratic party representative on the School Committee. He frequently collects and reflects the opinions and suggestions of the masses and democratic party members regarding various school matters, helping to resolve some issues.

Previously, all majors at Beihang University had a uniform five-year curriculum. With the changing situation, some democratic party teachers proposed multi-level education and different curricula. This suggestion was taken seriously by the school. The school decided that starting from 1989, different curricula would be implemented based on the characteristics of each major.

The Party Committee pays attention to cooperating with democratic parties, fostering mutual trust. Huang Shihua, a senior engineer in the Department of Civil Engineering and secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, said, "Every time I come to the school to teach, I always visit the United Front Work Department to chat, and I feel a sense of closeness." More than one-third of the democratic party members at the school have been recognized as advanced teachers and advanced workers.

Most democratic party members are on the teaching frontline and understand the students, who are also willing to communicate with them. In response to fluctuations in students' professional ideals, they selected four respected senior professors to hold a series of lectures, conducting vocational ethics education for graduating students, which had a good effect. Last spring, Vice President Chen Mingshao, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, presided over a dialogue between 10 democratic party members and over 30 students. During the meeting, they openly discussed issues such as the National People's Congress elections, democratic channels, educational funding, how to view the current state of students' thoughts, the situation of democratic parties, and party discipline. The students happily said that such dialogue meetings are refreshing and educational, and they hope to have more in the future.

    北工大民主党派人士热心教书育人
    本报讯  中共北京工业大学委员会重视发挥民主党派人士在教书育人、民主办校方面的主动精神和积极作用。
    这所大学有６０多名民主党派成员，其中６５％是高级知识分子。为使民主党派成员了解学校各方面情况，参与决策，校党委采取多种形式听取意见，定期对话，加强了相互沟通，使监督和协商制度化。每个学期的第三周，校长、党委书记都把校内各民主党派的同志请来，向他们通报本学期工作安排，听取意见和建议。１９８７年初，北工大成立了决策咨询机构——校务委员会，九三学社北工大支社立委石国乐教授作为民主党派代表进入校委会，他经常搜集并反映群众及民主党派成员对学校各项工作的意见和建议，促成了一些问题的解决。
    以往，北工大各专业学制一律五年。随着形势变化，该校一些民主党派的教师提出多层次办学和实行不同学制的建议。这项建议得到了校方的重视。学校决定从１９８９年开始，根据各专业的特点实行不同的学制。
    校党委注意同民主党派合作共事，肝胆相照。土木工程系高级工程师、民盟北京市委秘书长黄世华说：“我每次来学校上课后，总要去统战部坐坐，说说话，有种亲切感。”该校民主党派成员中，有１／３以上被评为先进教师、先进工作者。
    民主党派成员大多在教学第一线，他们了解学生，学生也愿意和他们交流。针对学生中专业思想波动的现象，他们推选出４位有威信的老教授开办系列讲座，向应届毕业生进行职业道德教育，收到了良好的效果。去年春天，北工大副校长、全国政协委员陈明绍主持了１０位民主党派成员和３０多名学生的对话会。会上，大家就人大选举、民主渠道、教育经费、如何看待学生思想现状、民主党派情况和党风等问题坦诚相见，侃侃而谈。同学们高兴地说，这样的对话会有新鲜感，长知识，希望以后多举行。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（何拄峰　冯媛）
