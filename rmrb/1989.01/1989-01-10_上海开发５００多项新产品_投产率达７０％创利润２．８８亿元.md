Shanghai's industrial system developed over 500 key new products last year, with a production rate of around 70%. The completed production value was 2.64 billion yuan, and the profit was 288 million yuan.

Last year, Shanghai's new products had the following three characteristics:

First, the technical level was relatively high, and the competitiveness was relatively strong. Among the new products developed last year, those that were technology-intensive and at the international level of the mid-1970s accounted for about 70%.

Second, there was a focus on the development and production of basic raw materials. In the new product development projects completed last year, basic raw materials accounted for about 23%.

Third, there was a focus on developing new products that could be exported to earn foreign exchange and replace imports. Among the new products developed last year, those that could be directly exported to earn foreign exchange accounted for 23%, and those that could replace imports accounted for about 60%. For example, the Shanghai Grinding Wheel Factory developed a set of diamond grinding wheels for color picture tubes, which were previously all imported from abroad, costing 4.5 million US dollars in foreign exchange annually. The production of this product can replace imports.

    去年上海开发和投产的新产品具有以下三个特点：
    一是技术水平较高，竞争力较强。去年开发的新产品中属于国际７０年代中期以上的技术密集型新产品占总数的７０％左右。
    二是重视了基础原材料的开发和投产。在去年完成的新产品开发项目中，基础原材料占２３％左右。
    三是重视开发能出口创汇和替代进口的新产品。去年开发的新产品中可直接出口创汇的占２３％，可替代进口的占６０％左右。上海砂轮厂开发的彩色显像管用的成套金刚石砂轮过去都从国外进口，每年花费外汇４５０万美元，该产品投产可顶替进口。
