After watching the documentary "Deng Xiaoping in Guangxi," I am very pleased and feel quite close to it. This is the first time that television has provided a relatively complete, comprehensive, and vivid introduction to Deng Xiaoping's leadership in the Baise Uprising, the Longzhou Uprising, and the establishment of the Red Seventh Army and Red Eighth Army. There are not many survivors from the Red Seventh and Eighth Armies. Among the more than three thousand people in the Red Eighth Army, as far as I know, besides Comrade Deng Xiaoping, only General Wu Xi and I are still alive.

Many people do not know about Xiaoping's history in Guangxi. In 1929, when the Chinese revolution was at a low ebb, the young Xiaoping had just returned from studying in France and was soon sent by the Central Committee to the remote and backward, complex situation of Guangxi to engage in revolutionary activities. He did not bring any troops or money, arriving with empty hands, relying only on the very weak local party forces to establish the revolutionary governments of the Left and Right Rivers and the Red Seventh and Eighth Armies. He successfully did united front work with the high-ranking left-wing generals of the Kuomintang, Li Mingrui and Yu Zuobai, and obtained Li Mingrui's full support. He recommended Li Mingrui to serve as the commander-in-chief of the Red Seventh and Eighth Armies. All of this shows his revolutionary wisdom and courage.

The documentary combines this historical period with today's reality very well. The narration says: "Yesterday, he united Li Mingrui, and today, he will unite all the Chinese people." This makes us realize that Deng Xiaoping's insistence on seeking truth from facts, rectifying wrongs, and promoting reform and opening up today is not accidental, but a consistent style. This period of history is worth our reflection, because it is of great significance to our deepening of reforms and future efforts to overcome poverty and backwardness.

At a time when many places are investing heavily in the construction of historical figures' memorial sites, we should not neglect revolutionary history. In 1982, when I returned to Guangxi, I saw that the former headquarters of the Red Eighth Army, where Xiaoping had stayed, was occupied by other units, and the ground floor was used as a warehouse. I made some suggestions and proposed to turn the Red Eighth Army headquarters into a memorial hall and also build a memorial hall in Li Mingrui's hometown of Beiliu County. From the documentary, I saw that these memorial halls have been built. They are witnesses to history and make me feel very close.

The documentary's portrayal of the comradeship between Xiaoping and Li Mingrui is very authentic. Xiaoping was the political commissar of the Red Seventh and Eighth Armies, and Li Mingrui was the commander-in-chief of the two armies. After the Longzhou Uprising in February 1930, I served as the secretary and quartermaster of the first brigade of the Red Eighth Army. After Xiaoping returned to Longzhou from Shanghai to report on his work, our first brigade, led by Yuan Zhenwu, escorted Xiaoping from Longzhou to Leiping. I spent that day with him, and we ate together, laughing and chatting. His revolutionary optimism left a deep impression on me. Later, I worked in the headquarters of the Red Seventh Army and often had contact with Li Mingrui. On the way north, Li Mingrui fought bravely and commanded well, and he also had a good relationship with the soldiers. Once, he bought a goose and cooked it himself, inviting the staff to eat together. Li Mingrui and Xiaoping built a deep friendship in the stormy journey. After Xiaoping took over the central work in 1978, he paid great attention to the policy implementation for the family of Li Mingrui, who had been wronged for many years, and also cared about the publication of an article introducing Li Mingrui's deeds in the People's Daily, wrote the name of the middle school in Li Mingrui's hometown, and wrote the inscription for the memorial monument of Li Mingrui and Wei Baoqun martyrs in Nanning Nanhu Park. The documentary's portrayal of the relationship between Xiaoping and Li Mingrui is very genuine, detailed, and moving, allowing us to appreciate the rich inner world of Xiaoping's character.

I particularly appreciate that the director Chen Dunduo introduced this historical period truthfully, acknowledging victories without exaggeration and admitting defeats without concealment, and not avoiding the painful fact that Li Mingrui was killed by the wrong line. I feel that the documentary has a solemn and simple style, with a good sense of proportion. The director combines Xiaoping's activities with the history of the Red Seventh and Eighth Armies, naturally and truly presenting Xiaoping's relationship with the Red Seventh and Eighth Army's soldiers, the people of the Left and Right Rivers revolutionary base area, and the leaders of the Guangxi Special Committee. The documentary combines Xiaoping's activities in Guangxi with the fate of the entire nation and country, leading the audience into deep reflection. As someone who experienced this period of history, watching the documentary also made me reflect on this extraordinary history.

If the director and the production team did not have a high level of revolutionary spirit and social responsibility, they would not have made this excellent film.

### 喜看《邓小平在广西》

　　喜看《邓小平在广西》
    钟夫翔
    看了艺术性文献纪录片《邓小平在广西》，我十分高兴，感到很亲切。这是第一次在电视上比较完整、全面、生动地介绍邓小平领导百色起义、龙州起义，创建红七军、红八军的革命历史。红七、八军的幸存者已经不多了，红八军三千多人中还活着的，据我所知，除了邓小平同志，就是吴西将军和我了。
    小平同志在广西的历史很多人不知道。１９２９年，中国革命处于低潮，年轻的小平从法国勤工俭学回国不久，就被中央派到偏远落后、形势复杂的广西山区搞革命。他既没带兵也没带钱，两手空空，仅依靠当地非常薄弱的地方党的力量，创建了左右江革命政权和红军第七军、第八军。他成功地做了国民党左翼高级将领李明瑞、俞作柏的统战工作，得到了李明瑞的完全支持。他推荐李明瑞担任红七、八两军的总指挥。这一切，都显示了他的革命智慧和胆略。
    片子在叙述这段历史的同时，和今天的现实很好地结合起来。解说词讲：“昨天，他团结了李明瑞，今天，他更要团结全部炎黄子孙。”使我们认识到邓小平同志今天坚持实事求是地拨乱反正、搞改革开放不是偶然的，而是一贯的作风，他是实事求是的典范。那一段历史值得我们思考，因为这对于我们今天深化改革及今后摆脱贫穷落后，都有重要的意义。
    在很多地方都在耗资修建历史人物纪念地的时候，我们不应该冷淡了革命历史。我１９８２年回广西，在龙州，看见小平同志住过的红八军军部驻地被其它单位占用了，楼下也做了仓库。我提了意见，并建议把红八军军部改为纪念馆，在李明瑞的故乡北流县也搞个纪念馆。从片子里我看到这些纪念馆都搞起来了。它们是历史的见证，使我颇感亲切。
    片子表现小平和李明瑞的战友之情，是很真实的。小平是红七、八军总政委，李明瑞是两军总指挥。１９３０年２月龙州起义后，我在红八军一纵队营部当书记官兼军需。小平同志去上海汇报工作后回到龙州，我们一纵队由袁振武负责护送小平同志从龙州到雷平，我这一天跟他在一起，他同我们同桌吃饭，有说有笑，他的革命乐观主义精神给我很深的印象。后来，我在红七军军部工作，常接触李明瑞。在北上途中，李明瑞同志英勇善战、指挥有方，跟士兵关系也好，有一次他买了一头鹅自己动手做，请参谋处人员一起吃。李明瑞与小平在风雨历程中建立了深厚的友情。１９７８年小平同志出来主持中央工作后，很关心给蒙冤多年的李明瑞家属落实政策，还关心在《人民日报》上发表介绍李明瑞事迹的文章，给李明瑞家乡的中学题写校名，为在南宁南湖公园建造的李明瑞、韦拔群烈士纪念碑题辞。片子对小平和李明瑞关系的表现，十分真切、细致、感人，使我们能从中寻味小平同志性格的丰富内涵。
    我特别赞赏片子的编导陈敦德同志能实事求是地介绍这段历史，有胜说胜，毫不夸大；有败讲败，也不虚掩，不回避李明瑞被错误路线杀害的沉痛事实。我觉得片子风格凝重、朴实，分寸感掌握得很好，编导将小平同志的活动与红七、八军的历史揉合起来介绍，真实、自然地表现了小平同志与红七、八军指战员、与左右江革命根据地人民、与广西特委的领导等方面的关系。片子将小平同志在广西的活动与整个民族、国家的命运息息相关地结合起来，把观众引入深深地思索。我是这段历史的过来人，看了片子，我也陷入了对这段不平凡历史的沉思。
    如果编导、摄制组没有高度的革命情怀和社会责任感，是不会拍出这部好片子的。
