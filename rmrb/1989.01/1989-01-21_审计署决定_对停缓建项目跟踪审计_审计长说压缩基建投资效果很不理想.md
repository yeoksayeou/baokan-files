The National Audit Office has decided to conduct follow-up audits on construction projects that have been suspended or delayed. The auditor general, Lǚ Péijǐan, revealed today that reducing the scale of construction projects is a key measure in the current rectification and reform efforts. The National Audit Office will organize teams to work with relevant departments to conduct follow-up audits on projects that the government has decided to suspend or delay nationwide.

Lǚ Péijǐan explained that the State Council has repeatedly emphasized the need to reduce the scale of construction projects. However, by the end of November last year, the nation had only reduced construction investment by 3.35 billion yuan, with very unsatisfactory results. In response, the National Audit Office has decided to conduct follow-up audits on projects that the government has decided to suspend or delay. The audits will focus on whether the projects have indeed been suspended or delayed, and whether there are any serious issues of waste or corruption in the handling of these projects.

For projects that have not yet been suspended or delayed, the National Audit Office will set a deadline for suspension. For those that fail to comply by the deadline, the National Audit Office will notify the financial and banking authorities to stop disbursing relevant funds. For cases with serious problems, the National Audit Office will hold the direct responsible parties and the main leaders accountable.

    审计长说压缩基建投资效果很不理想
    新华社北京１月２０日电（记者傅刚）吕培俭审计长今天在此间向记者透露，压缩基建项目是治理、整顿的一项重要内容，审计署决定组织力量，配合有关部门在全国范围内对政府决定停缓建的项目进行跟踪审计。
    吕培俭介绍说，压缩基建规模，国务院已经三令五申，到去年１１月底，全国只压缩基建投资３３５亿，效果很不理想。对此审计署决定，对政府决定停缓建的项目进行跟踪审计。审计的内容是：停缓建项目是否停缓；善后处理有无严重浪费的贪污问题。对于尚未停缓建的项目，限期停缓，对到期仍不执行的，除通知财政、银行停止拨付有关款项外，对问题严重的将追究直接责任者和主要领导人的责任。
