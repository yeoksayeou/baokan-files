Finland Launches "Respect Yourself" Fitness Campaign
County with Most Weight Loss to be Honored

Helsinki, January 3 (Xinhua) – A nationwide health promotion campaign titled "Respect Yourself" kicked off today in the Finnish capital of Helsinki. This is the third consecutive year that Finland has organized such a nationwide public health event aimed at improving the overall health of its citizens.

One of the most appealing aspects of the "Respect Yourself" campaign is the inter-county weight loss competition. The competition stipulates that if a county's citizens achieve the greatest average weight loss in the first nine months of this year, that county will be awarded a special honor.

Statistics show that more than half of Finland's adults are overweight. The combined weight of Finland's 5 million people exceeds the normal range by 15 million kilograms. Obesity-related conditions such as hypertension and diabetes, as well as joint damage from carrying excess weight, are common health issues in Finland. The substantial medical costs associated with treating these conditions also pose a significant burden on the national economy. In 1987 alone, Finland spent 2.5 billion Finnish marks (approximately $60 million) on hypertension medication.

The "Health Passport" is another key activity within the "Respect Yourself" campaign. Participants can obtain a passport card at post offices, and holders of the card must have it stamped to prove their participation in relevant fitness activities.

　　芬兰开展“请君自珍”健身运动
    公民减肥最多的县将获殊荣
    新华社赫尔辛基１月３日电  （记者郄霜涛）旨在普遍提高全体公民健康水平的“请君自珍”运动今天在芬兰首都赫尔辛基开始举行。这是芬兰连续第３年举办的一项全国性群众卫生保健运动。
    “请君自珍”运动中最吸引人的一项是全国各县之间展开的减肥比赛。比赛规定，在今年头９个月时间内如果某县公民平均体重下降最多，该县将获得殊荣。
    据统计，芬兰一半以上的成年人身体过于肥胖，全芬兰５００万人的体重一共超出正常１５００万公斤。肥胖引起的高血压、糖尿病，难于支撑过重身体导致的关节劳损成为芬兰的常见多发病。医治这些疾病的巨额费用也成为国民经济的一大负担。１９８７年，芬兰仅高血压药品一项开支，就高达２．５亿芬兰马克（约合６０００万美元）。
    “健康护照”是“请君自珍”运动中的活动。参加者在邮局可以领取护照卡片，持照者须在此卡片上加盖印章，证明他参加了有关健身运动。
