Thrilling plots and martial arts scenes, light-hearted songs and dances, and comedic elements made the Chinese screen in 1988 more lively than usual. However, after a round of intense action and laughter, both creators and their audiences felt a sense of emptiness: after all, there was still a lack of leading works to drive Chinese cinema forward.

According to a figure released by the Film Bureau, out of the 158 feature films produced last year, more than 60% were entertainment-oriented. This significant number and the ensuing discussion have been called an important film phenomenon of 1988.

Facing the surge of "entertainment film tide," let's hear what various parties have to say. The supervising department provided an analysis: after emphasizing the educational function of film art, there was a correction and a return to the original position, particularly emphasizing the entertainment function. The broad audience also needs joy, relaxation, and healthy outlets. Promoting entertainment value is indeed part of the "two for" principle. Chen Haosu, deputy minister of the Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television, who pays attention to this, believes that people's understanding of the entertainment value of films is "just beginning." He hopes to broaden the path for entertainment films and bring aesthetic enjoyment to the audience.

Factory directors burdened with heavy economic pressures are considering shooting a few profitable or at least break-even entertainment films as a way to save the situation. Yan Minjun from Changchun Film Studio complains that he spends almost 80% of his energy thinking about how to feed the 4,700 people in his factory. Director Yu Ben, who has always avoided thinking about money, had to start managing the accounts after becoming the deputy director of Shanghai Film Studio. The young Shanghai Film Studio, which has always insisted on its own style, now also has to ask before starting a film: how many copies can it sell? Someone said that film entrepreneurs use products to compete for economic benefits to survive and develop, which is also a driving force for the development of Chinese cinema.

The news from the film market is ruthless. For three consecutive years, martial arts films have topped the box office, with 15 of them each earning 10 million yuan. Next are detective films and comedies, while exploration films and opera films have poor box office performance. A certain film that emphasizes artistic value only earned 10,000 yuan.

A new sign deserves our attention: the box office performance of martial arts and thriller films in some places has already "declined."

The masses crave entertainment, but the key is what kind of entertainment you provide. Serious artists are already thinking: popularization does not mean low artistry. The supervising department also calls for this: please pay attention to the artistic quality.

They also point out that industrial and agricultural themes are weak links, military life on the screen in 1988 was neglected, and because the children's film plan was not completed, they owe a debt to 380 million young viewers.

When looking at the future development of Chinese cinema, some say that the sudden rise of entertainment films is only a short-term behavior and cannot replace the long-term goal of integrating thoughtfulness, artistry, and entertainment value. Others say that in a few years, when evaluating the merits and demerits of entertainment films, this worthy film phenomenon will not be underestimated.

In reviewing the 1988 Chinese screen, we cannot overlook a major achievement: Chinese films participated in 32 international film festivals and won 46 awards. Among them, "Red Sorghum" (the highest-grossing film of the year), "Hibiscus Town," and "Love in a Fallen City" won major awards. It should be affirmed that film creation still maintains a diverse format. Although entertainment films are not entirely satisfactory, the overall trend is upward.

Yesterday, the national feature film creation conference concluded in Beijing, summarizing last year's film work as: "This is a year of joint struggle in pain, and also a year of healthy development."

    经济上压力沉重　娱乐片形成大潮
    １９８８中国银幕：热闹过后感冷清
    据新华社北京１月１２日电  （记者郭玲春）惊险的情节和武打场面，轻曼的歌舞和喜剧色彩使１９８８年的中国银幕显得比往常热闹。但是在一番激烈的格斗和笑声过后，创作者和他们的观众却都感到了冷清：毕竟，这里还缺乏带动中国电影奋起的“领衔”作品。
    电影局公布的一个数字说，去年生产的１５８部故事片中，娱乐性较强的影片占到６０％以上。这个相当的数量和由此推开的一场讨论，被称为１９８８年一个重要的电影现象。
    面对涌来的“娱乐片大潮”，我们且听听各方人士的评说。主管部门作出了分析：曾经过分强调教育功能的电影艺术，在矫枉、回复到原位的时候，尤其重视了娱乐功能，广大观众群也需要愉悦、松弛和健康的渲泄。提倡观赏性，正是“二为”方面的题中之义。对此予以关注的广播电影电视部副部长陈昊苏以为，人们对影片娱乐价值的认识还“仅仅是开始”，他希望拓宽娱乐片的路子，把美的享受送给观众。
    负荷过重的电影制片厂厂长承受着经济的压力，拍几部能盈利或至少不赔本的娱乐片，也是解救“危难”的一法。长影的阎敏军诉苦说，他几乎用了８０％的精力去考虑全厂４７００人的吃饭问题。从来不钻“钱眼”的导演于本正当上上影厂副厂长后，不得不管管帐本了。向来坚持自己风格的青年电影制片厂，现在开拍影片前也得问一问：能卖几个拷贝？有人说，电影企业家用产品争得经济效益，以求生存和发展，这也是中国电影发展的一种推动力。
    从电影市场传来的消息是无情的。连着３年，武打片的票房价值居于首位，其中的１５部电影每部创收达１０００万元，其次是侦破片、喜剧片，而探索片、戏曲片则卖座不佳，某一部注重艺术性的影片仅仅收入１万。
    一种新的迹象提请我们注意：武打与惊险片在某些地方票房行情已经“下跌”。
    群众渴求娱乐，关键在于你提供什么样的娱乐。严肃的艺术家已经在思考：大众化并不等于艺术的低下，主管部门也为此而呼吁：请注重艺术的品格。
    他们同时点出，工农业题材是薄弱环节，军营生活在１９８８年的银幕上受到冷落，因为没有完成少儿影片计划，他们是向３．８亿小观众欠了债的。
    当着眼于中国电影今后发展的问题时，有人说，娱乐片的一哄而上只是短期行为，终究不能替代思想性、艺术性、观赏性合一这个长远目标，也有人说，若干年后再来评价娱乐片的功过时，将不会低估这一值得研究的电影现象。
    在回顾１９８８年中国银幕时，还不能疏漏了一项重大成果：中国电影参加了３２个国际电影节，荣膺４６项奖，其中《红高粱》（去年创收最高的一部影片）、《芙蓉镇》、《人·鬼·情》获得大奖。应当肯定，电影创作仍保持着多样化格局，娱乐片虽不尽如人意，但总体上呈提高趋势。
    昨天在北京结束的全国故事片创作会议对于去年电影工作的结论是：这是在痛苦中共同奋争，又是健康发展的一个年头。
