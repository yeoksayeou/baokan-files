Salvadoran guerrillas propose new domestic peace initiative

Duarte sees guerrilla decision to participate in elections as positive

Xinhua News Agency, Mexico City, January 24 - The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN), a Salvadoran guerrilla organization, proposed a new initiative for domestic peace on January 24 in Mexico City. The proposal calls for the government to postpone the originally scheduled March 19 general elections by six months.

Two leaders of the guerrilla organization spoke to the press in Mexico, stating that the guerrilla's proposal is the only choice to prevent further social unrest in El Salvador. The new peace initiative suggests that the Salvadoran Democratic Alliance Movement should be included in the Central Electoral Commission, and that a supervisory committee composed of various religious, human rights, and civilian organizations should be established to maintain order on election day.

The proposal also states that the guerrillas will respect the activities of all political parties and electoral institutions and will accept the election results and the existence of the current government during the transition period.

The guerrilla's proposal emphasizes that the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front rejects the upcoming elections. The guerrillas hope to quickly engage in discussions with the government regarding their new peace initiative.

According to reports from San Salvador, Salvadoran President Duarte responded to the guerrilla's peace proposal on January 24, stating that the guerrilla's decision to participate in the presidential elections is "positive." However, he refused to postpone the elections until September 15.

　　萨游击队提出国内和平新建议    
    杜阿尔特认为游击队决定参加选举是积极的
    新华社墨西哥城１月２４日电  萨尔瓦多游击队组织—法拉本多·马蒂民族解放阵线２４日在这里提出一项实现国内和平的新建议，要求政府把原订３月１９日举行的大选推迟６个月举行。
    该游击队组织的两名指挥员在墨西哥向报界发表谈话时指出，游击队的建议是阻止萨尔瓦多社会急剧动乱的唯一抉择。游击队在新的和平建议中提出，应让萨尔瓦多民主同盟运动参加到中央选举委员会中来、由各宗教、人权和平民组织组成一个监察委员会，负责在大选之日维持秩序。
    建议还说，游击队将尊重各政党和选举机构的活动，并将接受选举结果及整个过渡期间现政府的存在。
    游击队的建议强调，法拉本多·马蒂民族解放阵线拒绝即将举行的选举。游击队希望尽快同政府就其新和平建议进行讨论。
    另据来自圣萨尔瓦多的消息报道，萨尔瓦多总统杜阿尔特２４日对游击队的和平建议作出反应，认为游击队决定参加总统选举的是“积极的”，但是他拒绝将大选推迟到９月１５日举行。
