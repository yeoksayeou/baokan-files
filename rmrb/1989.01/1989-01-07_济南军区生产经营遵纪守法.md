The Jinan Military Region's various units, in their production and operational activities, strictly adhere to the country's laws, policies, and upper-level regulations, focusing their efforts on developing livestock farming, planting, and service-processing industries. According to preliminary statistics from earlier this month, the economic benefits for 1988 increased by 50% compared to 1987.

The Jinan Military Region has explicitly stipulated: units engaging in production and operations must not use the military's special status and equipment for speculation, and must not engage in commercial activities or establish companies in violation of regulations. A certain unit's training ground is located by the Bohai Sea, with five salt fields producing over 400,000 tons of salt annually in the vicinity. The training ground sees hundreds of companies and thousands of vehicles passing through each year, and each vehicle could carry one or two tons of salt, earning a profit of several hundred yuan. Some people proposed establishing a joint venture with them, which could yield a profit of over 100,000 yuan annually. They all refused, instead focusing on building terraces to plant soybeans and constructing ponds to raise fish and shrimp, earning an annual income of 100,000 yuan.

To ensure the correct direction of production and operations, the various units of the Jinan Military Region regularly conduct inspections and rectifications of production and operational units. The military region has formulated regulations and systems such as the "Regulations for the Management of Company Logistics Work" and the "Handbook for Basic Logistics Work." Units and individuals who strictly implement upper-level directives are commended, and issues are promptly addressed.

　　济南军区生产经营遵纪守法
    本报讯  济南军区各部队在开展生产经营活动中，严格遵守国家的法令政策和上级各项规定，集中精力发展养殖业、种植业和服务加工业。据日前初步统计，１９８８年的经济效益比１９８７年增长５０％。
    济南军区明文规定：部队搞生产经营决不能利用军队的特殊地位和装备搞倒买倒卖，决不能违反规定去经商、办公司。某部靶场地处渤海湾畔，周围年产４万吨以上的盐场便有５个。靶场每年有数百个连队和几千台车从靶场开进开出，每台车若装上一二吨盐，便可赢利二三百元。有人要和他们开办联营公司，每年可分成１０多万元。他们一律拒绝，把精力用在修台田种大豆、建池塘养鱼虾上，每年收入１０万元。
    为把正生产经营方向，济南军区各部队还定期对生产经营单位进行清理和整顿。军区制订了《连队后勤工作管理标准》、《基层后勤工作手册》等法规和制度。对严格执行上级指示的单位和个人给予表扬，发现问题及时制止。 　　　　　　　　　　　　　（李文朝　李景荣）
