Those with Special Skills Will Find the Right Job
Jiamusi Commercial School Cultivates Practical Talent

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, January 2 — The Jiamusi Commercial School in Heilongjiang Province has been cultivating "suitable and marketable" talent according to societal needs, winning praise from employers.

Jiamusi Commercial School is a provincial vocational secondary school. In recent years, as employers' demands for graduates have increased, the difficulty in job placement has become more pronounced. After analyzing this phenomenon, the school leadership concluded that vocational schools should primarily cultivate practical talent. The school decided to base its curriculum on the employment preferences of recent years, to identify students' strengths, and to teach according to individual aptitudes, ensuring that each student acquires a marketable skill. Some students are meticulous and diligent in their studies, so the school teaches them to be proficient in using the abacus. Others are quick-witted and have good communication skills, so the school trains them for supply and marketing work. Last year, all 89 graduates found suitable jobs within a month, much to the satisfaction of their employers.

　　身怀看家本领　方能适销对路
    佳木斯商校培养实用型人才
    新华社哈尔滨１月２日电  黑龙江省佳木斯商业学校根据社会需求，培养“适销对路”人才，受到用人单位的称赞。
    佳木斯商业学校是一所省属中等专业学校，近几年，因为用人单位对毕业生的要求提高，分配难的问题已日益突出。学校领导分析了这种现象后认为，中专应以培养实用型人才为主，学校决定根据近几年用人单位对学生的选择情况，发掘学生的特长，因材施教，让每个学生都学到一身“看家本领”。有的学生做事细心，学习扎实，学校教他们打一手好算盘，有的学生头脑灵活，有口才，学校培养他们搞供销工作。去年，８９名毕业生一个月之内都找到了适合自己的工作，受到用人单位的欢迎。
