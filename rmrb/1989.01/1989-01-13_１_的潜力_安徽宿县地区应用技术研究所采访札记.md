One soldier, one general, one unit—whether the work is good or bad, the command is effective or not, the management is good or not—the results are completely different. Some "1"s may become 0 or -1, -2. Some "1"s, however, may become 2 or 3, even to the point of one being worth ten or a hundred.

In the southern part of the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain, there is a state-owned research institute called the Anhui Su County Regional Applied Technology Research Institute, which has begun to achieve the goal of one being worth ten or a hundred.

Deputy Researcher Wang De Rong is the director of this institute and also the secretary of the party branch. He handles both business and ideological work, introduces and transfers technology, optimizes labor combinations, makes short-term plans, and envisions the future. He is the sole leader, handling everything inside and outside the institute. Some say he is worth dozens of "heads." For example, deciding on the introduction and transfer of an advanced technology, deciding on the recruitment and output of a talented person, generally, it only takes a day or two, and some decisions only take a few dozen minutes. He says that the time of a leader must be invested efficiently and effectively. The distribution of salaries and bonuses in this institute is based solely on contributions as the criterion for evaluation, and ineffective labor is not recognized. Especially in applied technology, without efficiency, there is no market share for you.

"When the top is straight, the bottom does not go awry; when the top is fast, the bottom does not go slow"—this kind of high efficiency and fast pace can be seen everywhere here. A person in charge of the institute's office handles the entire institute's meals, accommodation, and guest reception, and also serves as the driver. What is particularly moving is that he also takes turns guarding the gate. A secretary in the office serves as a clerk, mail handler, and also as a service staff member in the guesthouse, sweeping the floors and boiling water, doing everything. Their canteen, guesthouse, and office and laboratory, both inside and outside, have excellent service quality and good hygiene, which many large organizations can only look up to.

The institute has a total of 74 employees, with scientists making up more than half. The business scope includes 88 technologies in the fields of fermentation, food, chemical, and mechanical engineering, covering more than 500 units in 28 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country. Because they promote and transfer applied technologies that are urgently needed by agriculture and township enterprises, they are very popular. In the more than seven years since its establishment, the institute has not received a single penny from the state, but the "spark" of science and technology they have spread across the country has created a production value of nearly 200 million yuan and provided nearly 40 million yuan in taxes to the state. Although their service charges are not high, and some services are even free, they have created more than 20 million yuan in revenue each of the past four years.

　　“１”的潜力
    ——安徽宿县地区应用技术研究所采访札记
    本报记者  张振国
    一兵、一将、一个单位，工作优劣、指挥好坏、管理如何？其结果是截然不同的。有的“１”，可能变成０或负１、负２。有的“１”，则可能变成２或３，乃至以一当十、当百。
    在黄淮海平原南端，就有一个名叫“安徽宿县地区应用技术研究所”的国营科研单位，开始做到了以一当十、当百。
    副研究员汪德荣是这个所的所长，又是所党支部书记。他既抓业务，又抓思想，引进、转让技术，优化劳动组合，近期规划，远景构想，里里外外一把手，风风雨雨一肩挑。这个所只有他一个头儿。有人说他一人能顶几十个“长”。比如说，决定一项先进技术的引进与转让，决定一位能人的录用和输出，凡无上级作梗者，一般只需天把时间，有的只需几十分钟。他说，领导者的时间投向，一定要讲效率、讲效益，本所的工资、奖金分配，一律以贡献作为考核的唯一标准，不承认无效劳动。特别是搞应用技术，没有效率，就没有你的市场份额。
    “上正下不歪，上快下不慢”——这种有板有眼的高效率、快节奏，在此处处可见。所办公室的一位负责人，既管全所吃住、来宾接待，还兼任汽车司机。特别令人感动的，他还轮流值班看守大门。所办公室的一位秘书，当文书、收发，还当招待所的服务员，扫地、打开水，样样都干。他们的食堂、招待所，以及办公室、试验室内外，服务质量之佳，环境卫生之好，是很多大机关望尘莫及的。
    这个所共有职工７４人，科研人员占一大半。经营的业务范围有发酵、食品、化工、机械等方面技术８８项，辐射地区遍布全国２８个省、市、自治区的５００多个单位。由于他们搞的都是农业和乡镇企业急需的应用技术的推广和转让，所以大受欢迎。建所７年多来，未要国家一文钱，而他们撒向各地的科技“星火”，已创造产值近２亿元，为国家提供利税近４０００万元。尽管他们所营业收费不高，有的还无偿服务，但近４年来，每年创收都在２００万元以上。
