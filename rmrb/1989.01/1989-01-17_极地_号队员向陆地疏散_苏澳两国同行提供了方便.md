The 22 members of China's East Antarctic expedition team were evacuated from the "Ji Di" ship to the mainland yesterday, joining the 18 team members already on shore engaged in station-building work.

The team members who were evacuated to the Zhongshan Station site climbed onto the floating ice via the ship's rope ladder and then walked to the shore. The distance from the ship to the shore is about 400 meters, with more than a meter of thick floating ice covering the sea surface, leaving almost no gaps. The team members walked on it firmly. Newly set up tents and a large amount of food transported by helicopter met their needs for food and accommodation.

The Soviet Progress Station and the Australian Davis Station, adjacent to the Zhongshan Station site, also extended a helping hand. In addition to offering convenience in accommodation, they also notified the Chinese expedition team of the ice collapse forecast they had monitored.

The ice cover on the left side of the expedition ship has been in a stable state since the afternoon of the 15th, and so far, no new ice collapses have occurred.

　　“极地”号队员向陆地疏散
    苏澳两国同行提供了方便
    新华社极地号１月１６日卫星传真电  （记者张继民）中国东南极考察队２２名考察队员，昨日从“极地”号船疏散到陆地，同在岸上从事建站工作的１８名队员汇合。
    疏散到中山站站址的考察队员是顺着考察船软梯上到浮冰上，然后徒步上岸。从船到陆岸约有４００米距离，１米多厚的浮冰铺满海面，几乎没有缝隙，考察队员走在上面很坚实。新搭起的帐篷和用直升机运去的大量食品，满足了他们食宿的需要。
    与中山站站址毗邻的苏联进步站、澳大利亚劳基地也伸出援助之手，他们除提出在住宿方面给予方便外，同时还将监听到的冰崩预报情况通知我考察队。
    考察船左面远方的冰盖从１５日中午以后呈稳定状态，到目前为止未出现新的冰崩。
