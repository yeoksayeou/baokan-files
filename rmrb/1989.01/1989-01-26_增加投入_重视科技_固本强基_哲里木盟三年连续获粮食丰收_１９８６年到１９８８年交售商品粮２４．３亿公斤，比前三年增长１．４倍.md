Increase Input, Emphasize Technology, Strengthen the Foundation

Zhelimu League Achieves Three Consecutive Years of Bumper Grain Harvests

From 1986 to 1988, the Zhelimu League in Inner Mongolia overcame severe natural disasters such as drought, hail, and early frost, achieving three consecutive years of bumper grain harvests. The total production was 13.99 billion kilograms, 18.93 billion kilograms, and 20 billion kilograms respectively. Over these three years, the league delivered 24.3 billion kilograms of commercial grain to the state, an increase of 1.4 times compared to the previous three years. Last year, the league's rural population had an average of one ton of grain per person, and the average amount of commercial grain delivered per person reached 500 kilograms.

The significant progress in grain production in this league is due to not only the continuous deepening of rural reforms and the stabilization and improvement of the household contract responsibility system but also the emphasis on the following three aspects of work:

	— Prioritizing grain production in the league's economy. From the league to the banners (counties, cities), townships (towns, sumus), and villages (gachas), all levels of leadership have placed grain production at the core of their work, focusing on it with determination. The league committee and the league government office sign new target management responsibility contracts with the banners (counties, cities) at the beginning of each year, summarizing the experiences of the previous year's grain production and adjusting the crop structure based on market demand. This ensures that tasks are clear, indicators are detailed, and measures are effective. They also take timely measures to address different problems that arise during the farming season, ensuring that new issues in grain production are resolved promptly, further stimulating the enthusiasm of the grassroots and the broad masses of farmers to plant grain.

	— Increasing investment to improve production conditions. Of the 10.5 million mu of farmland in the league, 60% are medium and low-yield fields. Without increased investment to improve production conditions, it would be difficult to sustain grain production. Since 1986, the league leadership has focused on increasing agricultural investment and improving production conditions. Over three years, a total of 368 million yuan (equivalent to six times the total investment of the previous three years) has been invested to build 10,200 wells, expand and improve irrigation areas by nearly one million mu, and create 3.5 million mu of stable and high-yield fields. This has provided good irrigation conditions for 6.3 million mu of medium and low-yield fields.

	The league also attaches great importance to the role of farmyard manure. Over three years, each year, about 7.5 billion kilograms of farmyard manure have been applied to the fields.

	— Emphasizing intellectual development and scientific progress. To increase the yield per unit area, the league has since 1986 promoted the widespread use of plastic film mulching technology and new corn cultivation techniques, achieving significant results. In 1986, the league promoted the standardized cultivation of corn over 1.35 million mu, increasing the yield per mu from the previous 250 kilograms to 552 kilograms. In 1987, the corn planting area increased to 2.08 million mu, accounting for 25.3% of the league's total grain area, and the yield reached 64.8% of the league's total grain production. In 1988, the league expanded the corn cultivation area to 3.0069 million mu, producing 1.5 billion kilograms of grain, accounting for about 75% of the league's total grain and bean production. To ensure that farmers master advanced technologies, the league's governments at all levels have paid great attention to the technical training of farmers. Over three years, the league has held various agricultural technology training classes, training nearly one million people, and distributed more than 520,000 copies of various agricultural technology materials, enabling the majority of farmers to initially master advanced agricultural technologies.

　　增加投入　重视科技　固本强基    
    哲里木盟三年连续获粮食丰收
    １９８６年到１９８８年交售商品粮２４．３亿公斤，比前三年增长１．４倍
    本报讯　内蒙古哲里木盟，从１９８６年至１９８８年，接连战胜旱、冰雹、早霜等严重自然灾害，夺得连续三年的粮食大丰收，总产分别达到１３．９９亿公斤、１８．９３亿公斤和２０亿公斤。三年内，全盟向国家交售了２４．３亿公斤商品粮，比前３年增长１．４倍。去年全盟农村人均占有吨粮，人均交售商品粮达到５００公斤。
    这个盟的粮食生产之所以有如此大的进展，除了不断深化农村改革，稳定和完善家庭联产承包责任制外，还着重抓好以下三方面工作：
    ——把抓粮食生产放在全盟经济的首位。从盟到旗（县、市）、乡（镇、苏木）、嘎查（村）的各级领导都把抓好粮食生产作为工作之本，抓紧抓实。盟委和盟行署每年初在总结上年粮食生产经验的基础上，和旗（县、市）长重新签定目标管理责任状，并根据市场需求，帮助基层调整作物结构，作到了任务明、指标细、措施得力，并针对农时季节出现的不同问题，及时采取措施加以解决，使粮食生产中出现的新问题能得到及时解决，进一步激发了基层和广大农民种粮的积极性。
    ——增加投资，改善生产条件。全盟的１０５０万亩农田中６０％是中低产田，如不增加投入改善生产条件，粮食持续增产会遇到很大困难。盟领导从１９８６年开始，全盟狠抓增加农业投入，改善生产条件。三年中，累计投资３．６８亿元（相当于前三年投资总额的６倍），打机电井１．０２万多眼，扩大改善灌溉面积近百万亩，建成稳产高产田３５０万亩，从而使６３０万亩的中低产田有了较好的灌溉条件。
    这个盟还十分重视农家肥的作用，三年里，每年向农田增施的农家肥都在７５亿公斤左右。
    ——注重智力开发和科学进步。为了提高单位面积产量，这个盟自１９８６年以来大面积推广地膜覆盖技术和玉米栽培新技术，取得了明显效益。１９８６年，全盟推广玉米模式化栽培１３５万亩，每亩产量由过去的２５０公斤提高到了５５２公斤；１９８７年，玉米种植面积又增加到了２０８万亩，占全盟粮食总面积的２５．３％，产量高达全盟粮食总产的６４．８％；１９８８年，该盟又将玉米攻关面积推广到３００．６９万亩，产粮达１５亿公斤，占全盟粮豆总产的７５％左右。为了使农民掌握好先进技术，该盟各级政府十分重视对农民的技术培训工作，三年来，全盟举办了各类农技培训班，培训了近百万人（次），印发了各种农技资料５２万多册，使广大农民初步掌握了先进的农业技术。
