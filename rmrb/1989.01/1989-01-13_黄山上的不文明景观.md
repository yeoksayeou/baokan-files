Two foreign tourists crushed their empty soda cans and crumpled their food packaging, then stuffed them into their backpacks to carry down the mountain.

Meanwhile, a group of domestic tourists left behind a mess of paper and fruit peels after a picnic and departed without a care. Two young men even threw empty beer bottles into the valley.

This is what a reporter saw after autumn on Mount Huang, at the Jiao Long Peak and Fei Lai Peak.

The head of the Huangshan Management Bureau, Xia Fayuan, sighed deeply when hearing these accounts: "Uncivilized behavior by Chinese tourists is everywhere on Mount Huang:

	— Along the 5-kilometer road from the entrance to Huangshan to the hot springs, the national-style parrot-shaped streetlamps with green glass covers have almost all been smashed;
	— The pines and bamboos along the mountain paths, including the famous Ten Famous Pines like the Welcoming Pine, all bear scars from being carved with stone knives;
	— During the blooming season of the famous azaleas, they are often picked and broken, leaving branches and flowers scattered."

Xia Fayuan said that the two most troublesome issues for the management are: first, tourists littering with paper, fruit peels, and other garbage. Huangshan receives 1.5 to 1.7 million domestic tourists annually. Even if only a small portion of them litter, without cleaning, the main tourist routes will turn into "garbage corridors." Therefore, the management bureau has hired more than 10 local farmers as cleaners. They climb high and dangerous paths every day to pick up trash. Even so, some cliffs and deep valleys are already piled high with empty cans and broken bottles. Management staff worry that one day, some valleys will be filled with garbage. Second, discarded cigarette butts. There are "No Smoking" signs all over Huangshan, but in the past 10 years, there have been more than 10 fires, almost all caused by discarded cigarette butts. Since last October, due to drought and dry grass, to prevent fires, the management bureau sends 20-30 people to patrol the mountain every day, but it is still difficult to prevent all incidents.

### 黄山上的不文明景观

　　黄山上的不文明景观
    两位外国游客，将喝完饮料的易拉罐踩瘪，将食品废包装盒揉紧，然后塞进自己的旅行袋背下山去。
    而一群国内游客，野餐后留下一地废纸、果皮，便扬长而去；两名男青年还将空啤酒瓶掷下山谷。
    这是记者秋后登黄山，分别在鳌鱼峰、飞来峰看到的两个镜头。
    黄山管理局负责人夏发年听记者讲述这些情况时，很感慨地说：我国游客的不文明行为在黄山上到处可见：
    ——黄山大门至温泉５公里的道路旁边，具有民族风格的鹦鹉路灯，翠绿色的玻璃灯罩几乎被打光；
    ——黄山山道边的松、竹，包括迎客松等十大名松，全都带着石刮刀刻的伤痕；
    ——黄山名花杜鹃盛开时，总被攀折得枝断花残……
    夏发年说，最使管理人员伤脑筋的是两件事：一是游客乱扔废纸、果皮等垃圾。黄山每年接待１５０—１７０万国内游客，即使是一小部分人乱扔，如不清扫，主要旅游线也会变成“垃圾长廊”。于是，管理局聘用了１０多名农民清洁工，他们每天攀高登险去拾垃圾，即使这样，一些悬崖深谷下，已积了大堆空罐碎瓶。管理人员担心，总有一天，有的山谷会被垃圾填满。二是乱扔烟头。黄山到处都有“禁止吸烟”的标语，但黄山近１０年来发生过１０多次大小火灾，几乎都是乱扔的烟头引起的。去年１０月以来，天旱草枯，为防火灾，管理局每天要派２０多人巡山，但还是防不胜防。
