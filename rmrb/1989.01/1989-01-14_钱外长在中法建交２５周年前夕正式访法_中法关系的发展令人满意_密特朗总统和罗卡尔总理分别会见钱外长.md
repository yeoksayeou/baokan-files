In the lead-up to the 25th anniversary of Sino-French diplomatic relations, Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, at the invitation of French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas, began a two-day official visit to France on January 12. Both foreign ministers expressed satisfaction with the development of Sino-French relations in Paris and agreed to further strengthen this relationship in the future.

During three rounds of talks held yesterday and today, the foreign ministers of both countries exchanged views on bilateral relations and major international issues.

Qian noted that China and France established diplomatic relations in January 1964. France was the first Western power to recognize the People's Republic of China. The Chinese government has always highly valued this. Qian said, "The Chinese government has always attached great importance to France's role and influence in international affairs and regards the comprehensive development of Sino-French friendly cooperation as an important task. We want to elevate our relations in politics, economy, culture, and other areas to an unprecedented level." He also expressed his satisfaction with the similar or close views held by both countries on many major international issues.

Dumas emphasized that there are many commonalities between France and China, and strengthening bilateral political relations can play a positive role in maintaining world peace and resolving regional conflicts. After the talks, the two foreign ministers signed a memorandum of understanding to establish a consulate general in each other's country.

Yesterday, Dumas hosted a banquet in honor of Qian.

Yesterday afternoon and evening, French President François Mitterrand and Prime Minister Michel Rocard separately met with Qian.

Mitterrand said during the meeting that the international situation is easing, the improvement of Sino-Soviet relations, and the rapprochement between Western Europe and the Soviet Union are all factors contributing to current international peace.

According to a spokesperson from the Chinese side, both sides have "consistent or similar" positions on international relations and the Cambodian issue. Both sides hope that the Cambodian issue will be resolved "fairly and reasonably" as soon as possible.

Rocard said during the meeting that there are no shadows in the political relations between France and China, and the two countries should further strengthen their relations in the future. Qian conveyed the greetings of Premier Li Peng to Rocard. Rocard once again invited Li Peng to visit France.

    中法关系的发展令人满意

    本报巴黎１月１３日电  记者张启华报道：在中法两国建交２５周年前夕，中国外长钱其琛应法国外长罗朗·迪马的邀请，从１２日起对法国进行为期两天的正式访问。两国外长在巴黎一致表示，中法关系的发展是令人满意的，并愿意在今后使这种关系继续得到加强。
    在昨天和今天举行的３次会谈中，中法外长就双边关系和重大国际问题交换了意见。
    钱外长指出，中法两国于１９６４年１月建交。法国是第一个承认中华人民共和国的西方大国。中国政府一直对此给予高度评价。钱外长说，“中国政府一向重视法国在国际事务中的作用与影响，并把全面发展中法友好合作关系作为一项重要任务”，要“把双方在政治、经济、文化等方面的关系引向空前的高度”。他还对两国在许多重大国际问题上存在着相同或近似的看法表示高兴。
    迪马外长强调指出，法中两国之间有许多共同点，加强双边政治关系，可以在维护世界和平和解决地区冲突方面发挥积极的作用。会谈后，两国外长就双方各增设一总领馆签订了一项意向书。
    昨天，迪马外长举行宴会欢迎钱其琛外长。
    昨天中午和傍晚，法国总统密特朗和总理罗卡尔分别会见了钱其琛外长。
    密特朗总统在会见时说，国际形势趋向缓和、中苏关系的改善、西欧与苏联的接近都是当前国际和平的因素。
    据中方发言人透露，双方对国际关系和柬埔寨问题的立场“一致或相似”。双方都希望柬问题尽快得到“公平合理”的解决。
    罗卡尔总理在会见时说，法中两国政治关系没有阴影，今后应进一步加强两国关系。钱外长转达了李鹏总理对罗卡尔总理的问候。罗卡尔总理再次邀请李鹏总理访问法国。
