Former women's volleyball team main attacker Jiang Ying held her wedding ceremony in Shenyang today.

Jiang Ying's husband is named Zhao Xu, 27 years old, and works in the personnel department of Anshan Iron and Steel Company. He is a graduate of Northeast Institute of Technology.

The two were childhood neighbors. When Jiang Ying was 9 years old and started playing volleyball, Zhao Xu was a member of the Anshan City amateur volleyball team. As they grew older, their feelings for each other deepened, and they established a romantic relationship through correspondence.

After retiring, Jiang Ying temporarily serves as an assistant coach and player for the Liaoning women's volleyball team.

Singing is not as natural for Jiang Ying as playing volleyball. However, at today's wedding, she had to invite performers from the Shenyang Song and Dance Troupe and announcers from Liaoning Radio Station to sing "The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl" with her husband, bringing the lively wedding to a climax.

Leaders from the Liaoning Provincial Government, the Provincial Sports Commission, and the Provincial Institute of Physical Education attended Jiang Ying's wedding.

　　原女排主攻手姜英做新娘
    新华社沈阳１月２２日电（记者王健民）中国女排原主攻手姜英今天在沈阳举行了婚礼。
    姜英的丈夫叫赵旭，今年２７岁，在鞍山钢铁公司人事处工作，是东北工学院的毕业生。
    他俩小时候是邻居。姜英９岁学打排球时，赵旭是鞍山市业余体校排球队队员。以后，随着年龄的增长，双方感情加深，经鸿雁传书确立了恋爱关系。
    姜英退役后，暂时在辽宁女排当助理教练兼队员。
    唱歌，对姜英来说，远不及打排球那样拿手。可是，在今天的婚礼上，她不得不请沈阳歌舞团的演员和辽宁电台的播音员，陪她和丈夫共唱一曲《天仙配》，这使热闹的婚礼达到了高潮。
    辽宁省省长李长春和省体委、省体育运动学院等有关部门的领导，参加了姜英的婚礼。
