From many perspectives, 1988 was the most eventful year since the Worldwatch Institute began publishing its annual "State of the World" report in 1984. This year, the American public paid increasing attention to environmental issues, and so did other countries. During the summer of 1988, American news media almost daily reported on environmental problems: natural disasters, record-breaking high temperatures, polluted beaches, urban air pollution alerts, and so on. The same was true internationally. All of this reminds us that the global system that sustains life may be in trouble. This was the view expressed by Lester Brown, president of the Institute, in a year-end interview with a reporter.

He said that some of the things that happened in 1988 were things we did not think would happen. For example, the water level of the Mississippi River in the United States dropped to a record low, almost drying up. In 1988, the United States' grain production for the first time in history fell below its consumption. Fortunately, we have large reserves to make up for domestic shortages and exports. If there is another drought in 1989, it will greatly reduce North America's grain exports and may lead to panic buying in grain-importing countries, causing grain prices to soar.

Some famous meteorologists around the world have pointed out that global temperatures are rising, and this trend is accelerating. But this is just the beginning of global warming; even hotter summers may be ahead. The impact of human activities on the environment and their consequences are becoming more apparent. Every year, we publish the "State of the World" report, pointing out that forests are decreasing, deserts are expanding, soil is eroding, many species of plants and animals are disappearing, greenhouse gases are increasing, and the ozone layer is thinning. There is currently no sign of reversal.

In terms of environmental protection, we have a lot to do, such as controlling population growth, reducing the use of mineral fuels, stopping deforestation, etc. These are all huge projects, and even doing one of them is extremely difficult. Unfortunately, we have to do several of these things at the same time. We have only ten years to reverse this overall trend. If we cannot do this, then environmental deterioration will lead to economic decline, and the two will form a vicious cycle. In a sense, we are waging a war, a war to save the Earth.

He believes that to mobilize all forces to counter the threat of environmental deterioration, the key is to reduce conflicts between the East and the West. Soviet leaders are prepared to fundamentally rethink U.S.-Soviet relations. Not long ago, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, during her visit to the United States, said that the Cold War is dead. These words coming from the mouth of a conservative leader of the Western world are unusual. The United States and the Soviet Union may be able to work together to stabilize the Earth's climate or restore Africa's economic development. If we cannot replace conflict with cooperation, we will not be able to reverse the trend of global economic and environmental deterioration.

### 污染、灾害、气候异常向人类报警  保护环境拯救地球刻不容缓

　　污染、灾害、气候异常向人类报警
    保护环境拯救地球刻不容缓
    本报华盛顿电  记者张允文报道：从很多方面来看，１９８８年是世界观察研究所自从１９８４年开始发表《世界状况》的年度研究报告以来最有意思的多事之年。这一年美国公众越来越关注环境问题，其他国家也如此。１９８８年夏天，美国新闻媒介几乎每天都有关于环境问题的报道：自然灾害、创纪录的高温、污染的海滩、城市空气污染告警等等。国际上也是如此。所有这一切都提醒我们，全球维持生活的体系可能会发生问题。这是该所所长莱斯特·布朗在岁末接受记者采访时发表的看法。
    他说，１９８８年发生的一些事情是我们过去不认为会发生的。比如美国密西西比河的水位下降到创纪录的水平，到了几乎干枯的地步。１９８８年美国的粮食产量历史上第一次低于美国的消费量。幸运的是我们有大量储备，可供补充国内的缺额和出口。如果１９８９年再发生一次干旱，将使北美的粮食出口大大减少，也可能导致粮食进口国出现抢购风，粮价随之飞涨。
    世界上一些著名气象学家指出，全球气温在上升，这一趋势正在加速。但这仅仅是全球气温升高的一个开始，可能更热的夏天还在前头。人类活动对环境的影响及其后果越来越明显了。我们每年发表《世界状况》的报告，指出森林在减少，沙漠在扩大，土壤在流失，很多动植物品种在消失，温室气体在增加，臭氧层在减少。目前尚看不到逆转的前景。
    在保护环境方面我们有很多事情要做，如控制人口增长、减少使用矿物燃料、停止砍伐森林等，这些都是巨大的工程，单进行一件也是极其困难的。不幸的是我们得同时进行几件大事。我们只有十年的时间来扭转这个总趋势。如果我们做不到这一点，那么环境的恶化将导致经济的下降，两者形成恶性循环。在某种意义上，我们正进行着一场战争，一场拯救地球的战争。
    他认为，要动员一切力量来对付环境恶化的威胁，关键是减少东西方的冲突。苏联领导人准备从根本上重新考虑美苏关系。不久以前英国首相撒切尔夫人在访问美国时说，冷战已死亡。这句话出自一位保守的西方世界领导人之口是不同寻常的。美苏两国有可能一起合作来使地球的气候稳定，或恢复非洲的经济发展。如果不能以合作代替冲突，就无法逆转全球经济和环境恶化的趋势。
