	Li Zhaoxing on the Meeting Between Chinese and Israeli Foreign Ministers
	Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 12th — Today, in the afternoon, the spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Li Zhaoxing, stated that China and Israel have agreed to maintain contact through their permanent representatives to the United Nations.

	He said, “The Israeli side has repeatedly expressed a willingness to develop relations with China. Our stance is very clear: this depends on changes in the Middle East situation and Israeli policies.”

	Li Zhaoxing made the above statement in response to a question from a foreign journalist at today’s press conference.

	The journalist asked: Does China maintaining contact with Israel through their permanent representatives to the United Nations indicate a change in China’s policy towards Israel?

	The spokesperson said, “On January 9th, Foreign Minister Qian Qichen met with Israeli Foreign Minister Arens in Paris. Both sides exchanged views on the Middle East situation. Qian Qichen pointed out that the Middle East situation has seen new developments, with the PLO showing a flexible and realistic attitude. He hoped that Israel could also adopt a flexible attitude and not miss this good opportunity provided by history to push the Middle East situation in a positive direction. Qian Qichen emphasized that the history of the Middle East over the past 40 years has proven that the Middle East problem can only be resolved through peaceful negotiations, and that reliance on war will not solve the problem.”

　　李肇星谈中以外长会晤
    新华社北京１月１２日电  中国外交部发言人李肇星今天下午说，中国和以色列商定，双方将通过常驻联合国代表继续保持联系。
    他说，“以色列方面多次表示愿意发展以中关系。我们的态度是很明确的：这取决于中东形势和以色列政策的变化。”
    李肇星是在今天下午的新闻发布会上回答一位外国记者提问时作上述表示的。
    记者问：中国和以色列通过双方常驻联合国的代表保持接触是否表示中国对以色列的政策已有所改变？
    发言人说，１月９日，钱其琛外长在巴黎会见了以色列外长阿伦斯。双方就中东局势问题交换了意见。钱其琛指出，目前中东形势出现了新的转机，巴解组织表现出了灵活的、现实的态度，希望以色列也能够采取灵活态度，不要错过历史提供的这样一个好机会，以推动中东局势向好的方向发展。钱其琛强调说，中东４０多年来的历史证明，中东问题只能够通过和平谈判来解决，依靠战争是解决不了问题的。
