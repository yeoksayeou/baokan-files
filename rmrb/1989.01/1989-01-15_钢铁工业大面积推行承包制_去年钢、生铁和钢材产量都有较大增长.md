The contracting responsibility system is being widely implemented in China's steel industry, significantly promoting its development. Currently, 86.7% of county-level and above steel enterprises have adopted the contracting system. Out of 110 key national and local steel enterprises, 100 have implemented the contracting responsibility system.

The milestone of surpassing 30 million tons of steel production was achieved in the first half of 1988. Contributing to this achievement were 99 large and medium-sized steel enterprises that had implemented the contracting system, with their steel production increasing by 11.07% compared to the same period last year. Pig iron and steel product outputs increased by 7.7% and 8.2% respectively. This is a clear result of the contracting responsibility system.

The contracting responsibility system has motivated enterprises to improve their production and economic efficiency, ensuring sustained and stable growth. In 1987, China's steel production increased by 384 million tons on the basis of several consecutive years of growth. In the second half of 1988, due to tight coal, electricity, transportation, and raw material supplies, the growth rate of steel production slowed down, but it still exceeded the national plan, reaching 5922 million tons for the year.

Due to the contracting system, enterprises have enhanced their self-development capabilities, accelerated technological upgrades, and created important conditions for shifting investment from the state to the enterprises. According to statistics from the first half of 1988 for 99 large and medium-sized enterprises under the contracting system, after completing their contracted profit delivery tasks, the enterprises retained 1.89 billion yuan in profits, an increase of 19% compared to the same period last year. Anshan Steel, Capital Steel, and Benxi Steel each retained over 100 million yuan in profits in the first half of the year, with more than 60% of these profits allocated to technological upgrades and production development.

　　钢铁工业大面积推行承包制
    去年钢、生铁和钢材产量都有较大增长
    新华社北京１月１４日电  （记者孙杰）承包经营责任制正在我国钢铁工业大面积推开，有力地推动了钢铁工业的发展。目前，全国已有８６．７％的县以上钢铁企业实行承包制。１１０个国家重点或地方骨干钢铁企业中，实行承包经营责任制的就有１００家。
    全国钢产量突破３０００万吨是在１９８８年上半年实现的。对此做出贡献的有实行承包制的９９个大中型钢铁企业，它们的钢产量比上年同期增长１１．０７％，生铁、钢材分别增长７．７％和８．２％。这是承包责任制带来的显著效果。
    承包责任制调动了企业积极性，保证了生产和经济效益持续稳定增长。１９８７年全国钢产量在连续几年递增的基础上，净增３８４万吨。１９８８年下半年，由于各地煤电运和原材料紧张，全国钢产量增长速度虽有所下降，但仍超额完成了国家计划，全年达到５９２２万吨。
    由于承包，增强了企业自我发展的能力，加快了企业技术改造的步伐，使投资主体逐步由国家转移到企业创造了重要条件。据１９８８年上半年９９个承包的大中型企业统计，在完成包干上交任务后，企业留利达１８．９亿元，比上半年同期增长１９％。鞍钢、首钢、本钢半年留利都超过１亿元，留利的６０％以上都将用于技术改造和发展生产。
