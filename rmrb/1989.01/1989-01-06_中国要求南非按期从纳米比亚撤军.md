    China demands that South Africa withdraw troops from Namibia on schedule.

    New China News Agency, Beijing, January 5th: Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Li Zhaoxing said at a press conference this afternoon that to ensure the fairness and freedom of Namibia's elections under the effective supervision of the United Nations, China demands that the South African authorities withdraw troops from Namibia on schedule, disband military organizations in Namibia, and reduce the number of police to the minimum.

    The spokesperson made these remarks in response to a reporter's question about China's comments on the United Nations Security Council's proposal to reduce the budget of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group.

    He said, the Chinese government and people have always supported the Namibian people's just struggle for national independence. China hopes that the United Nations Security Council can reach an agreement as soon as possible on how to implement United Nations Security Council Resolution 435.
