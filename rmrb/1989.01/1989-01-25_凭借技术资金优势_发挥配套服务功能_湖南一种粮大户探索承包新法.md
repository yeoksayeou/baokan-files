Leveraging Technological and Financial Advantages to Provide Integrated Services: A Lake South Grain Farmer Explores New Contracting Methods

A report from Changsha, Hunan: Ji Yun, an ordinary farmer from the middle reaches of the Li Shui River in Hunan, has used his creative practices and leveraged his technological and financial advantages to integrate land contracting and management with supporting services, exploring new methods for contracting and management.

Ji Yun, who is 40 years old this year, is the first grain farmer in Shimen County. At the beginning of last year, he signed a joint farming contract with seven households in Jingtian Guan Village, Baiyang Lake Township: the seven households retained enough land for their own consumption, while the remaining rice fields were contracted by Ji Yun under a "five-package" system, which included providing technology, production funds, production materials, fertilizers and pesticides, and paying the levies. Ji Yun paid a fixed wage to each laborer; the seven households each paid Ji Yun 600 kilograms of rice, with any surplus belonging to them. Ji Yun and the seven households formed a joint body, managing 104.5 mu of rice fields last year.

Ji Yun is a top-notch farmer in the area. After taking over the contract, he implemented strict unified management for each production link. He invested all of his savings, totaling over 10,000 yuan, as working capital for grain production. Throughout the production process, Ji Yun maintained close contact with the agricultural technology department and boldly promoted new technologies. Last year, all of Ji Yun's contracted rice fields used high-quality seeds, with 90% of the area applying hybrid late rice high-yield technology.

After one year of practice, the joint body achieved significant economic benefits, with a total rice production of over 70,000 kilograms. The seven households increased their rice production by an average of over 2,500 kilograms, with a yield per mu that was approximately 150 kilograms higher than that of surrounding farmers, and each household's pure income from grain production was 1,353 yuan.

County Magistrate Yao Shaojiu analyzed that after implementing the household contract responsibility system in rural areas, village and township administrative levels often lack the ability to provide supporting services, which restricts the development of agricultural production. Having skilled farmers take over the government's service functions undoubtedly provides a new approach.

　　凭借技术资金优势　发挥配套服务功能    
    湖南一种粮大户探索承包新法
    本报长沙电  湖南澧水中游的一个普通农民基云，以他富于创造性的实践，凭借资金和技术优势，将土地的承包经营和配套服务一体化，探索承包经营新方法。
    今年４０岁的基云，是石门县第一个种粮大户。去年初，他与所在的白洋湖乡荆田观村的７户农民，订了一个联合种田的承包合同：７个农户除留足口粮田外，其余的稻田由基云实行“五包”，即包提供技术、生产资金、生产资料、化肥农药和上交提留；基云付给每个劳动力固定工资；７个农户每户上交基云６００公斤稻谷，增产归己。基云同７个农户组成的联合体去年共经营管理稻田１０４．５亩。
    基云是当地顶呱呱的种田能手，承包经营后，他对每个生产环节实行严格的统一管理。他垫付了自己的全部积蓄１万多元，用作种粮周转金。在整个生产过程中，基云与农技部门保持密切联系，大胆推广新技术。去年，基云承包的稻田全部使用良种，９０％的面积应用了杂交晚稻高产技术。
    经过１年的实践，这个联合体取得了显著的经济效益，稻谷总产达７万多公斤。７个农户平均增产稻谷２５００多公斤，亩产比周围农民高约１５０公斤，每户种粮纯收入１３５３元。
    石门县县长姚绍球分析说，在农村实行承包经营后，村、乡行政一级往往缺乏配套服务的能力，限制了农业生产的发展。由种田能手替政府发挥服务功能，无疑提供了新的思路。
