Two years in a row, the power outage on New Year's Eve is too frustrating. Last spring festival, I returned to Jiajiakou Township in Ningjin County, Hebei, to visit relatives. On New Year's Eve, when the whole family was sitting in front of the television, ready to watch the CCTV Spring Festival Gala, the power suddenly went out. We waited and waited, and when the power finally came back, the show had already ended. Coincidentally, the year before last New Year's Eve, we also experienced a power outage.

What will this spring festival be like? I suggest that the local power supply department make early preparations to ensure that the farmers can have a happy holiday.

　　两年除夕夜停电太气人
    去年春节我回河北宁晋县贾家口乡探亲。农历除夕，当全家坐在电视机前，准备收看中央电视台的春节联欢晚会节目时，突然停电。左盼右盼电来了，节目也结束了。无独有偶，前年农历除夕夜，我们那里也停电。
    今年春节又会怎样呢？建议当地供电部门提早做好准备，让农民过个愉快的节日。
