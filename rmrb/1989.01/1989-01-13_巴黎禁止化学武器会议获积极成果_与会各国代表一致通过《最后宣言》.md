The Paris Conference on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons achieved positive results. Representatives from the participating countries unanimously adopted the "Final Declaration."

Our reporter Zhang Qihua reported from Paris on January 11: The Paris Conference on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons concluded today after five days of discussion and consultation. The conference ended with the adoption of the "Final Declaration" and was met with enthusiastic applause from the 149 country representatives. The conference's role in promoting the elimination of chemical weapons was fully affirmed.

The "Final Declaration" stated that the participating countries are "determined to prevent the use of chemical weapons through their complete elimination. They solemnly declare their commitment not to use chemical weapons and condemn the use of such weapons."

The declaration said that the participating countries reaffirm the continued validity of the 1925 Geneva Protocol and emphasize the "need to promptly sign a convention on the prohibition of the development, production, stockpiling, and use of all chemical weapons and the destruction of such weapons. This convention should be global, comprehensive, and effectively verifiable." To this end, it urged the Geneva Disarmament Conference to redouble its efforts to resolve the remaining issues as a matter of urgency and to conclude the convention as soon as possible.

The declaration emphasized: "As long as chemical weapons continue to exist and proliferate, there is a possibility of their use, posing an increasingly serious threat to international peace and security. The participating countries are deeply concerned about this, and they reaffirm their full support for the United Nations Secretary-General in fulfilling his investigative duties in cases where violations of the Geneva Protocol are alleged."

The declaration finally pointed out that the participating countries need to continue their unremitting efforts to achieve comprehensive and thorough disarmament under effective international supervision, thereby ensuring the right to peace and security for all countries.

During the conference, 10 more countries joined the Geneva Protocol.

    与会各国代表一致通过《最后宣言》
    本报巴黎１月１１日电  记者张启华报道：禁止化学武器巴黎大会经过五天的讨论、磋商，在今天下午通过了《最后宣言》后，宣告结束。１４９个国家的代表以热烈的掌声祝贺大会圆满成功，充分肯定了大会在推动消除化学武器的进程中所起的积极作用。
    《最后宣言》指出，与会各国“决心通过全面消除化学武器来防止使用这类武器。它们庄严声明，承诺不使用化学武器，并谴责使用这类武器”。
    宣言说，与会各国确认１９２５年在日内瓦签署的议定书的持续有效性，并强调“需要早日签订一项关于禁止发展、生产、储存及使用一切化学武器并销毁此类武器的公约。该公约应是全球性的，全面的，可以有效核查的”。为此，它呼吁日内瓦裁军谈判会议加倍努力，作为紧急事项迅速解决余下的问题并早日缔结公约”。
    宣言强调指出：“化学武器只要依然存在和扩散，就有被使用的可能，从而对国际和平与安全构成日益严重的危险。与会各国对此极为关切，它们重申，“全力支持联合国秘书长在发生被指控为违反《日内瓦议定书》的情形时履行其调查职责”。
    宣言最后指出，与会各国有必要坚定不移地持续努力，在有效国际监督下达成全面彻底裁军，从而确保所有国家的和平及安全的权利”。
    在大会期间，又有１０个国家加入《日内瓦议定书》。
