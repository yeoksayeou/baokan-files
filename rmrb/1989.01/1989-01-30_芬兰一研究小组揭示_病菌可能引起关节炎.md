A research team from the University of Turku in Finland recently discovered remnants of Yersinia bacteria in the joint fluid of arthritis patients, revealing the previously unrecognized fact that bacteria can cause arthritis.

For a long time, people have been exploring the causes of arthritis through the study of joint connective tissues. Recently, British researchers found that chlamydia can cause arthritis. The medical community believes that Finland's discovery is another significant advancement in the study of arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.

Yersinia bacteria are typically found in the tonsils of pigs and can be transmitted to humans through pork. Yersinia bacteria can cause diarrhea, and after recovery, the antibodies to Yersinia bacteria in the body usually disappear naturally.

However, doctors found that patients who had diarrhea and subsequently developed arthritis still had bacterial antibodies in their bodies. Researchers discovered remnants of Yersinia bacteria in the white blood cells of the joint fluid from these patients.

　　芬兰一研究小组揭示
    病菌可能引起关节炎
    新华社赫尔辛基１月２７日电  芬兰土尔库大学的一个研究小组最近在关节炎患者的关节液中发现有耶尔森氏菌残体，揭示了细菌可引起关节炎这一尚未被人们认识的事实。
    长期以来，人们一直通过关节连结组织的研究探索关节炎的起因。不久前英国研究人员曾发现，衣原体属能引起关节炎。医学界认为，芬兰的这一发现是关节炎和风湿性关节病研究中取得的又一重要进展。
    耶尔森氏菌通常存在于猪的扁桃腺内，并通过猪肉传染给人。耶尔森氏菌能引起腹泻，患者痊愈后，体内的耶尔森氏菌抗体通常会自然消失。
    然而医生发现，那些腹泻后又患关节炎的病人体内依然存在病菌抗体。研究人员从这些患者关节液的白细胞中发现了耶尔森氏菌的残体。
