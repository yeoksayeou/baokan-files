Israel's Finance Minister Peres announced on January 1st some measures of the economic austerity plan to adapt to the continuously rising inflation and the enormous defense expenditures.

According to reports from Jerusalem, under this plan, the Bank of Israel will reduce the exchange rate of the Israeli currency against the U.S. dollar by 8% on January 1st. Previously, the central bank had announced that to promote the export of industrial products, the currency would be devalued by 5% the previous week.

Israel's economy has shown some development since the implementation of the economic austerity plan in July 1985, but the economic growth has slowed down since the Palestinian uprising began in December 1987. Currently, the unemployment rate is 7%, and the inflation rate for last year reached 20%.

　　以色列实行经济紧缩计划
    以色列财政部长佩雷斯在一月一日宣布了经济紧缩计划的一些措施，以便适应不断上升的通货膨胀和巨额国防开支。
    据来自耶路撒冷的报道，根据这一计划，以色列中央银行一日将以色列货币与美元的汇率降低百分之八。此前一周，中央银行曾宣布，为了促进工业品的出口，将货币贬值百分之五。
    以色列经济在一九八五年七月实行紧缩经济计划后有所发展，但经济增长自一九八七年十二月巴勒斯坦人的斗争开始后慢了下来。目前，失业率为百分之七，去年的通货膨胀率达百分之二十。
