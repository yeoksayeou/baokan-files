Some people in the West believe that Britain has "consistently maintained a reserved attitude" towards European unification. What is Britain's actual stance? The Minister of Trade and Industry, Lord Young, said:

Not opposed to a large market but opposed to a "United States of Europe"

Summary: Britain is increasingly rooted in Europe and is a "leader" in building a large market. British enterprises will occupy a significant share in the large market.

Our reporter Chen Tiezhen reports from London: The British government's Minister of Trade and Industry, Lord Young, who is in charge of economic and trade relations with the EEC, told our reporter that in welcoming the "large market," Britain is neither a "laggard" nor a "spectator," but rather a "leader" that is better than other countries.

He said that Britain's preparations are divided into three stages: First, starting from March 1988, a large amount of publicity was conducted, providing consultation services through telephone hotlines and computer data, organizing study sessions in various places, etc. Second, publicity work was done for various sectors of society, especially for business people. A year ago, only 5% of business people knew the significance of 1992, now it has reached 90%. Third, various companies across the country are making more specific and practical preparations to meet the challenges of the large market. One of Britain's most profitable industries, the chemical industry, is formulating overseas action plans to welcome 1992, strengthening cooperation with counterparts in other European countries. The food, electricity, and other industries are seeking to strengthen their competitive positions through mergers. Some companies in the transportation industry are optimistic about the prospects of the large market and have proposed the slogan "Hitching a ride on the 1992 express."

When discussing whether the British economy can gain benefits from the large market, Lord Young confidently said: "If it were 10 years ago, Britain would have faced great difficulties. Now it is different. The British economy is full of vitality, and British enterprises that have regained their competitiveness will certainly occupy a significant share in the large market. Now most British enterprises know how to adapt to the new challenges of Europe."

Regarding the prospects of building a large market, he said: "I believe that by 1992, the goal of the large market will be basically achieved." He expressed that Britain has never opposed the European large market, but opposes the "United States of Europe."

Lord Young believes that regarding border control, Britain has fully committed to reducing border controls to the lowest possible level, but British citizens have the right to oppose terrorism, drug trafficking, and dangerous diseases. Therefore, some border checks still need to be retained. On the issue of the European Monetary Union, Britain has not joined the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System, but Britain has always believed that it will join at the appropriate time. He believes, "The 12 member countries have a unified goal. Britain's fate is closely related to Europe, and Britain has always been on the path of the large market, becoming increasingly rooted in Europe."

### 不反对大市场但反对“欧洲合众国”

　　西方有人认为英国对欧洲联合“一贯持保留态度”，英国的立场究竟如何？贸工大臣扬勋爵说：
    不反对大市场但反对“欧洲合众国”
    内容提要：英国越来越扎根于欧洲，是建设大市场的“带头者”，英国企业将在大市场中占有较大份额。
    本报伦敦电　记者陈特安报道：英国政府主管同欧共体经贸关系事务的贸工大臣扬勋爵对本报记者说，在迎接“大市场”方面，英国既非“落伍者”，也非“旁观者”，可以说是比其它国家都好的“带头者”。
    他说，英国的准备工作分三个阶段：一是从１９８８年３月开始进行大量的宣传，通过电话热线、计算机数据提供咨询服务，各地组织研究会等等。二是对社会各界，尤其是企业界人士做宣传工作。一年前，仅５％的企业界人士知道１９９２的意义，现已达到９０％。三是全国各类公司为迎接大市场的挑战，正在做些更具体切实的准备工作。英国赚取外汇最多的工业行业之一——化学行业正在制订迎接１９９２年的海外行动方案，加强与欧洲其它国家同行的合作。食品、电力等行业通过兼并力求加强其竞争地位。交通行业有的公司对大市场的前景表示乐观，提出了“搭上１９９２年特别快车”的口号。
    在谈到英国经济能否从大市场中赢得好处时，扬勋爵充满自信地说：“如果是１０年前，英国将是很困难的。现在不同了。英国经济已充满活力，恢复了竞争力的英国企业必然会在大市场中占有较大的份额。现在多数英国企业都知道怎样才能适应新欧洲的挑战。”
    关于建设大市场的前景，他说：“我相信，到１９９２年，大市场的目标将会基本上达到。”他表示，英国从不反对欧洲大市场，但反对“欧洲合众国”。
    扬勋爵认为，关于边界控制，英国已充分承诺把边界控制减少到最低限度，但英国公民完全有权利要求反对恐怖主义、贩毒和危险的疾病。因此，仍需保留某些边界检查。在欧洲货币联盟问题上，英国未加入欧洲货币体系的汇率机制，但是，英国一直认为它将在适当的时候加入。他认为，“１２个成员国之间，在总目标上是一致的。英国的命运与欧洲息息相关，英国一直走在大市场的大道上，越来越扎根于欧洲。”
