The Party Committee of the Songhua River Military Sub-District of the Heilongjiang Military Region exemplifies discipline in following party and military regulations, strictly enforcing various rules and regulations, and upholding the glorious tradition and fine style of hard struggle. Recently, it was commended by the superior leadership.

At the end of 1988, the rear service department of the military sub-district made contact with 100 boxes of high-grade cigarettes at an internal discount price. Reselling them could yield a profit of five or six ten thousand yuan. At that time, the rear service department had already prepared the funds. However, Commander Yuan Ruhe and Political Commissar Ma Dianyin believed that although the source of these cigarettes is legitimate, we must strictly follow the regulation that military personnel are not allowed to engage in business. No matter how great the profit, we cannot do anything that violates discipline.

In early 1988, the Party Committee of the military sub-district formulated the "Regulations on Reception Work in the Military Sub-District." They established a supervision box to allow the masses to supervise the implementation of the regulations by each member of the Party Committee. Over the course of a year, five large-scale meetings were held, and there were no instances of extravagant feasting. In November 1988, the Heilongjiang Military Region held an on-site experience exchange meeting on national defense education in Yanhou. Someone suggested, "All military sub-districts in the province are coming to participate in the meeting. As the host, we cannot be too stingy and should treat them well." However, the leaders of the military sub-district insisted on following the rules and strictly enforcing the reception standards, without making any exceptions.

The Songhua River region includes nine counties, with the closest being 40 kilometers from Harbin and the farthest being over 200 kilometers away. For many years, the leaders of the military sub-district have been using "Beijing" brand jeeps for work inspections. In recent years, some places have started buying luxury cars, and someone suggested buying a good car for the leaders. Although they ride in old Beijing jeeps, they feel very secure.

　　松花江军分区党委模范遵守纪律
    不搞倒卖　招待从简　轿车不买
    本报讯  黑龙江省军区松花江军分区党委模范遵守党纪、政纪，严格执行各项规章制度，坚持艰苦奋斗的光荣传统和优良作风，最近受到上级领导机关的通报表彰。
    １９８８年底，军分区后勤部联系到１００箱内部优惠价高级香烟。转手就可获利五六万元。当时，后勤部门的同志已筹好款。司令员袁如和、政委马殿银认为，这批香烟货源渠道正当，但我们要严格执行军人不能经商的规定，利再大，也不能做出违反纪律的事来。
    １９８８年初，军分区党委制定了《军分区机关接待工作的有关规定》。设立了监督箱，让群众监督每个党委成员执行规定的情况。一年来，召开五次大型会议，没出现一次大吃大喝的情况。去年１１月份黑龙江省军区在延寿召开国防教育现场经验交流会，有人建议“全省各军分区领导都来参加会议，我们作为东道主，不能太小气了，应好好招待一下”。但是，军分区领导坚持按章办事，严格执行招待标准，没有破例。
    松花江地区所属九个县，距哈尔滨最近的４０公里，最远的２００多公里，军分区领导检查工作，多年来一直使用“北京”牌吉普车。近几年，一些地方刮起了买豪华车的风，有人提出为领导买台好车。虽然他们坐的旧北京吉普车，但他们心里很踏实。
