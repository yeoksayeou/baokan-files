The mechanical and electrical industry achieved a total industrial output value growth rate of 25.2% in 1988, completing the year at a rapid pace. In the next two years, this industry will focus on strengthening macro-control, reducing the overheated growth rate, and adjusting internal structures.

The mechanical and electrical industry's total industrial output value and profits in 1988 accounted for more than one-quarter of the national total, making it the largest industrial sector in China. Vice Minister of the Ministry of Mechanical and Electrical Industry, Hè Guāngyuǎn, stated at the opening of the National Mechanical and Electrical Industry Work Conference today: Due to economic overheating, the mechanical and electrical industry faces issues such as uncontrolled investment, blind development, and overproduction. Through adjustments over the next two years, we aim to significantly control redundant construction, production, and imports, make noticeable progress in structural adjustments, and improve enterprise quality.

The specific targets for structural adjustments in the mechanical and electrical industry are as follows: no new production points or factories for general mechanical and electrical products; strict adherence to planning for the layout of popular products such as color picture tubes, VCRs, program-controlled exchanges, and automobiles; control of unreasonable imports of mechanical and electrical products; strengthening of key weak links in national demand for complete sets of equipment, basic components, basic parts, and basic machinery; ensuring the production and construction of import-substituting and export-expanding products; significant reduction of low-level surplus products; and increasing the proportion of electronic investment products that promote modernization.

To achieve these adjustment targets, Hè Guāngyuǎn proposed strengthening and improving macro-control to address the "scattered and chaotic" issues in the development of the mechanical and electrical industry. The overall approach is: "One industrial policy, one industry planning account, multiple channels for funding sources, and phased project approvals."

State Councilor and Minister of Mechanical and Electrical Industry, Zōu Jiāhuá, attended the meeting and delivered a speech.

　　机电工业部部署今明年工作重点
    调整内部结构，一般产品不再增加新点，热门产品严格按规划布点，控制不合理进口
    本报北京１月１６日讯  记者皮树义报道：机械电子工业以总产值比上年增长２５．２％的速度走完了１９８８年，今明两年这个工业部门将以加强宏观调控，降低过热的增长速度，调整内部结构为工作重点。
    机电工业１９８８年实现的工业总产值和利税，分别占全国工业总产值和利税的１／４多，已成为我国工业最大的产业部门。机电部副部长何光远在今天开幕的全国机电工业工作会议上指出：由于经济过热，机电工业存在着投资失控、盲目发展、生产过速等问题。要经过今明两年的调整，使重复建设、重复生产、重复引进得到明显控制，结构调整取得明显进展，企业素质得到明显提高。
    机电工业调整结构的具体目标是：一般机电产品不再增加新点、不再开办新厂；彩色显像管、录像机、程控交换机、汽车等热门产品严格按规划布点；控制不合理的机电产品进口；加强国家急需的成套设备、基础零部件、基础元器件、基础机械等突出的薄弱环节；保证替代进口和扩大出口产品的生产建设；低水平的长线产品有较大压缩；增加促进现代化建设的电子投资类产品比重。
    为了实现调整目标，何光远提出要加强和改进宏观调控，解决机电工业发展的“散、乱”问题。总的思路是“产业政策一个令，行业规划一本帐，资金来源多渠道，立项审批分层次。”
    国务委员兼机械电子工业部部长邹家华到会并讲话。
