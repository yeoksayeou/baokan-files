On Chaohu Lake in Anhui Province, there is a volunteer rescue team. Over the past five years, they have voluntarily salvaged 17 sunken ships, recovering economic losses of over 10 million yuan. This volunteer rescue team is the Huoqiu County Fishery Team. Its history is quite extraordinary!

In November 1984, a 55-ton cement motor-sailing ship belonging to fisherman Wang Honghua of the Huoqiu County Fishery Team hit a submerged reef and sank while fishing. Upon hearing the news, the entire team rushed to the scene and jumped into the icy water, rescuing 6 people. The sunken ship was quickly salvaged. This incident left a deep impression on everyone.

Soon after, a ship from the Chaohu Development Company's Fishery Team sank in Chaohu Lake. They sent people to seek help. The leaders of the Huoqiu County Fishery Team immediately organized a rescue effort. After a 3-day, 3-night struggle, the sunken ship was finally towed ashore. It was the peak fishing season at the time, and the Chaohu Development Company's Fishery Team felt guilty, offering a reward, which was declined by the Huoqiu County Fishery Team. From then on, whenever there was a sunken ship on Chaohu Lake, people would first think of the Huoqiu County Fishery Team. The title "Volunteer Rescue Team" quickly spread across the lake.

On the evening of April 27, 1988, a motorboat from Jiangxi, carrying rapeseed from Hefei, was swept into the lake by strong winds and waves. The Huoqiu County Fishery Team, working nearby, immediately sent out a rescue signal. Led by their leaders, the team members jumped into the water, dove into the ship's cabin, and pulled out bag after bag of rapeseed to shore. They then began to pump water out of the ship. After more than 6 hours of hard work by over 30 people, the sunken ship finally surfaced.

　　巢湖上的义务抢险队
    在安徽省巢湖上，有一支义务抢险队。５年来，他们义务打捞沉船１７艘，挽回经济损失１００多万元。这支义务抢险队，就是霍丘县捕捞队。说起来它还有一段不平凡的经历哩！
    １９８４年１１月，霍丘县捕捞队渔民王红花家一艘５５吨位水泥机帆船在捕鱼时触暗礁沉没。全队人闻讯赶来，纷纷跳入冰冷的水中，救出６人，沉船也很快被打捞上岸。这件事给人们留下深刻的印象。
    不久，巢湖开发公司捕捞队的一艘轮船沉入巢湖中，他们派人前来求救。霍丘县捕捞队的干部们立即组织力量前去抢险。经过３天３夜的奋战，沉船终于被拖上岸。当时正值捕鱼旺季，巢湖开发公司捕捞队过意不去，送来酬金，被霍丘县捕捞队谢绝。打那以后，巢湖上只要有沉船，大家首先就想到霍丘县捕捞队。“义务抢险队”的称号很快在巢湖上传开了。
    １９８８年４月２７日晚，江西一艘机动船从合肥运油菜籽途经巢湖，被风浪卷入水底。在附近作业的霍丘县捕捞队，立刻发出了抢险信号。在干部的带领下，队员们跳入水中，潜进船舱，将一包包油菜籽捞上岸，接着又吊船排水。３０多人经过６个多小时的奋战，沉船终于浮出了水面。
