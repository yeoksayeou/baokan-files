By the end of last year, the Agricultural Bank of China had issued 2.7 billion yuan in subsidized loans for poverty alleviation to 273 counties designated as impoverished by the state, enabling these regions to solve the food security problem for approximately 55% of the impoverished households.

The special poverty alleviation subsidized loans were initiated by the Agricultural Bank of China at the end of 1986, following a decision by the State Council. The plan is to inject 1 billion yuan annually, with the program concluding in 1990, aimed at helping poverty-stricken areas resolve the food security issue for the majority of rural households.

In the second half of 1988, the State Council's Office for Economic Development in Poverty-Stricken Areas, the Agricultural Bank of China, and the National Audit Office conducted a joint inspection of the use of special poverty alleviation subsidized loans across various provinces. According to statistics from 12 provinces and autonomous regions, over two and a half years, a total of 1.876 billion yuan in poverty alleviation loans were issued, solving the food security problem for 3.614 million impoverished households, accounting for 53.9% of the households and enterprises supported by the loans. This resulted in an additional income of 1.69 billion yuan for the households. Among these, 48.7% of the projects were highly effective, 40% were moderately effective, and 11.2% were low or non-effective.

Dai Xianglong, Vice President of the Agricultural Bank of China, stated that behind these achievements lie several concerning issues. Notably, the proportion of overdue loans is excessively high. By the end of last year, out of the 810 million yuan in overdue poverty alleviation loans nationwide that should have been recovered, only 27% were recovered.

A colleague from the Agricultural Bank of China responsible for this work told the reporter that over the next two years, the bank will further strengthen the management of poverty alleviation subsidized loans, focusing on supporting the implementation of the "Food Security Program" in poverty-stricken areas. This includes ensuring credit funds for farmers to purchase plastic mulch and fertilizers, and supporting leading processing enterprises that can drive the development of agricultural and livestock industries for thousands of households. Additionally, it involves strengthening the supervision and management of county-level poverty alleviation development companies. For units and individuals that misappropriate poverty alleviation loans, embezzle loans, or infringe upon farmers' interests, legal responsibilities will be pursued.

　　支持贫困地区实施“温饱工程”
  　农行两年发放贴息扶贫贷款２７亿
    ２７３个贫困县５５％的贫困户解决温饱问题
    新华社北京１月８日电  （记者焦然）到去年底，中国农业银行已向２７３个国家审定的贫困县发放了２７亿元贴息扶贫贷款，使这些地区５５％左右的贫困户解决了温饱问题。
    专项扶贫贴息贷款是中国农业银行根据国务院的决定从１９８６年底开始发放的，计划每年投放１０亿元，到１９９０年结束，以帮助贫困地区解决大多数农户的温饱问题。
    １９８８年下半年，国务院贫困地区经济开发办、中国农业银行、国家审计署３家联合对各省专项扶贫贴息贷款使用情况进行了一次大检查。据１２个省、自治区的调查统计，两年多时间里共投放１８．７６亿元扶贫贷款，解决了３６１．４万个贫困户的温饱问题，占贷款扶持户和贷款企业扶持户的５３．９％，使农户新增收入１６．９亿元。其中效益好的项目占４８．７％，效益一般的项目占４０％，效益差和关停项目占１１．２％。
    中国农业银行副行长戴相龙说，在这些成绩背后也有许多值得忧虑的问题。突出的是到逾期贷款比重过大。到去年底，全国应有８．１亿元到逾期扶贫贷款应收回，但只收回２７％。
    中国农业银行主管这项工作的同志对记者说，今明两年农业银行将进一步加强对扶贫贴息贷款的管理，重点支持贫困地区实施的“温饱工程”，保证农户购买地膜、化肥所需信贷资金，支持能带动千家万户发展种养业的龙头加工企业。同时，加强对各县扶贫开发公司的监督管理，对那些挪用扶贫贷款，私分贷款，侵占农民利益的单位和个人，要依法追究责任。
