Lech Walesa, the former chairman of the Solidarity Trade Union, said on the 19th that the Solidarity Trade Union they are preparing to revive "will be wise and rational."

Walesa made these remarks at a press conference in Gdansk just after the conclusion of the 10th Plenum of the Polish United Workers' Party. Walesa clearly expressed his opposition to the expansion of strikes. He said, "Poland can no longer afford the tension caused by strikes; 'reason tells us that the path of strikes is not viable.'"

When discussing the round-table conference that all parties are working to convene, Walesa said: "The round-table conference is a symbol. But Poland indeed needs harmony and understanding. The sooner we reach an understanding, the less our losses will be."

　　瓦文萨已表示反对罢工扩大
    波兰前团结工会主席瓦文萨十九日说，他们正在准备恢复的团结工会“将是聪明的、理智的”。
    瓦文萨是在波兰统一工人党十中全会刚刚闭幕以后，在格但斯克举行记者招待会时说这番话的。瓦文萨明确表示反对罢工扩大。他说，波兰已再也经不起罢工造成的紧张了；“理智告诉我们，罢工之路是行不通的”。在谈到各方都在致力召开的圆桌会议问题时，瓦文萨说：“圆桌会议是一个象征。但波兰确实需要和睦和谅解。我们越早达成谅解，我们的损失就越小”。
