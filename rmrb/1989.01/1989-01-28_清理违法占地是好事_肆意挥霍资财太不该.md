Last September and October, Nan Ta District in Lezhi County of our province organized a task force of over 70 people, led by the district party secretary and district head, to crack down on illegal land occupation. They stationed themselves in eight townships and formed another task force of over 120 people, including district, township, village, and group cadres. Clearing illegal land occupation is a good thing, but the actions of this task force have been met with strong disapproval from the local people.

Around the National Day, the task force cleared illegally occupied farmland in San Li Township and collected over 50,000 yuan in fines. The township used the 20,000 yuan it received to entertain the task force with feasts and to distribute bed sheets, blankets, and umbrellas. In Xin Le Township, the task force worked for nine days, with over ten tables set for each meal. The township collected 260,000 yuan in fines for illegal land occupation, keeping 120,000 yuan for itself, but spent 160,000 yuan on entertainment alone.

Xian He Township, unable to afford to entertain the task force, borrowed money from the township's agricultural economic service station. The expenditure for eight days was as follows: 1,739 yuan for compensation to district task force members for lost work time; 1,720 yuan for compensation to village and group cadres for lost work time; 350 yuan for compensation to logistics personnel for lost work time; 5,746 yuan for the district government office's food expenses; 2,432 yuan for living allowances for the task force and village and group cadres; 2,277 yuan for conference expenses and distribution of souvenirs; 1,049 yuan for accommodation and rental of equipment; and 500 yuan for rental of cooking utensils. Due to the excessive spending, the township found it hard to bear the burden, and some leaders had to consider writing to the county to request funds to cover the deficit.

　　清理违法占地是好事  肆意挥霍资财太不该
    去年９、１０月间，我省乐至县南塔区组织了一个由区委书记、区长牵头的７０多人的清理违法占地工作组，他们进驻８个乡，又组成了有区、乡、村、组干部参加的１２０多人的工作组。清理违法占地是好事，可他们的所作所为老百姓极为反感。
    国庆节前后，工作组在三里乡清理乱占耕地，罚款５万多元。乡里将分得的２万多元，全部用于招待工作组吃喝及分发被面、床单、雨伞等。工作组在新乐乡工作９天，每天就餐的人要摆十几桌之多。这个乡清理违法占地，罚款２．６万元，乡里得１．２万多元，招待开支竟达１．６万元。
    仙鹤乡因无钱招待工作组，便向乡农经服务站借钱。８天的开支情况是：区工作组人员误工补贴１７３９元；村组干部误工补贴１７２０元；后勤人员误工补贴３５０元；乡政府办伙食开支５７４６元；工作组及村、组干部生活补贴２４３２元；会议及分发纪念品２２７７元；住宿及租借用具１０４９元；租借炊具费５００元。由于超额太多，乡里难以承受，个别领导不得不筹划给县里打报告，请求拨款弥补饥荒。
