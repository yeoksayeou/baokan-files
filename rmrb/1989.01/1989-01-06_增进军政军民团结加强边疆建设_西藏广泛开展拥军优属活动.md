The various levels of government in the Tibet Autonomous Region and the broad masses of Tibetan people have been promoting a new trend of supporting and loving the military, extensively carrying out activities to support the military and favor the families of soldiers. This has enhanced military-political and military-civilian unity and strengthened border construction.

"The Communist Party has brought a new Tibet; the People's Liberation Army has brought the liberation of millions of serfs." For a long time, the broad masses of Tibetan people have treasured the deep bond between the military and the people. The various levels of government in the Tibet Autonomous Region have regarded supporting the military and favoring the families of soldiers as a major task for local construction. During the New Year, Spring Festival, Tibetan New Year, and the August 1st Military Day, they concentrate their efforts to carry out activities to support the military and favor the families of soldiers. From the leadership organs of the autonomous region to the prefectures, cities, and counties, they have established reception activity leading groups, visiting the troops' companies and border outposts to comfort the frontier fighters, soliciting the troops' opinions on local work, and comforting the objects of preferential treatment.

In addition to carrying out activities to support the military and favor the families of soldiers during the festival periods, the various places in the autonomous region also pay attention to carrying out social activities to support the military and favor the families of soldiers. The various levels of government and the masses insist on cherishing the military, supporting the construction of the troops as an inescapable responsibility. They provide conveniences for the troops in actual difficulties in combat training, national defense construction, camp construction, production and living, as well as the employment of family members and the schooling of children. In the past five years, the various places' governments and the masses have done more than ten thousand good deeds for the troops.

In addition, the masses in the various places in the autonomous region have spontaneously organized preferential treatment service groups. In the past five years, they have supported 558 households of preferential treatment objects.

    “没有共产党，就没有新西藏；没有人民解放军，就没有百万翻身农奴的今天。”长期以来，西藏广大藏族人民十分珍惜军民鱼水深情。西藏自治区各级政府，把拥军优属作为地方建设的一项大事。每年元旦、春节、藏历年和“八一”建军节期间，都集中时间开展拥军优属活动。从自治区领导机关到地、市、县都成立了慰问活动领导小组，深入部队连队、边防哨卡慰问戍边指战员，征求部队对地方工作的意见，慰问优抚对象。
    在开展节日期间拥军优属活动同时，自治区各地注意开展社会性的拥军优属活动。各级政府和群众坚持把爱护军队、支援部队建设作为义不容辞的责任。对部队在作战训练、国防施工、营房建设、生产生活及家属就业、子女上学等方面的实际困难，提供方便。近五年来，各地政府和群众共为部队做好事十万多件。
    此外，自治区各地群众还自发组织了优抚服务小组。五年来共扶持优抚对象五百五十八户。
