Li Peng Meets with Cuban Foreign Minister, Says China and Cuba Should Expand Friendly Cooperation in All Fields

BEIJING, Jan. 21 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng of the State Council met with Cuban Foreign Minister Isidoro Malmierca this afternoon in the Great Hall of the People. Li said that China and Cuba are both socialist countries and have no reason not to further strengthen friendly cooperation. We should not only further develop economic and trade relations but also expand friendly cooperation in other fields.

Malmierca first conveyed Chairman Castro's greetings to Premier Li. He said that this visit is of positive significance for promoting the development of relations between the two countries.

Li Peng warmly welcomed Malmierca's visit. He said that this is the first visit by a Cuban foreign minister to China in 29 years, which signifies an improvement and development in the cooperative relations between the two countries. He expressed his belief that the foreign minister's visit will further promote the development of Sino-Cuban relations.

When talking about the current international situation, Premier Li Peng pointed out that there is a trend towards dialogue replacing confrontation and tension easing, which is beneficial to the cause of peace and development. This is also the common demand of the peoples of most developed and developing countries. Li Peng said that China pursues an independent foreign policy and needs a long-term peaceful international environment. We are willing to strengthen friendly cooperative relations with all countries in the world. When talking about the Cambodian issue, Premier Li Peng hoped that the Non-Aligned Movement would make positive contributions to the realization of a quadripartite joint government led by Sihanouk.

Malmierca said that during this visit to China, he exchanged views with Chinese leaders on a wide range of issues and had the same views on many major international issues. He said that while East-West relations have improved, South-North relations have not improved, and the economic gap between the two is widening. Malmierca also briefed Premier Li Peng on the current situation in Central America.

Foreign Minister Qian Qichen was present at the meeting.
