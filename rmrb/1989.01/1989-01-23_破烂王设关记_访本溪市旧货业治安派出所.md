The Tale of the "Junk King" Setting Up a Checkpoint
— A Visit to the Benxi City Secondhand Goods Public Security Substation

We heard that the "Junk King" has a "Secondhand Goods Public Security Substation," which sounds quite novel. This is probably the first of its kind in the country. Just after the New Year, we braved the falling snow to visit and find out more.

The "Junk King" is the nickname of Zhang Yujin, the general manager of the Benxi City Materials Recovery Company in Liaoning Province. The nine-episode television series "The Junk King" was based on him.

In his low, modest office, he explained to us why he established this substation:

"You shouldn't underestimate the junk collection business; it's a special industry with strong policy implications. There are two sayings that circulate in society: 'Junk collectors take anything, thieves steal anything,' and 'Junk collectors and thieves are brothers.'"

We interjected, saying we recently saw an article in the newspaper titled "Beware of the 'Junk Kings' in Various Places." He laughed and said:

"The materials recovery department, if not managed properly, can easily become a place for fencing stolen goods. So, in 1984, when I took over the Benxi City Materials Recovery Company, I was worried about this aspect. Initially, I suggested establishing a policy inspection department. The leadership agreed, and we set up three people to patrol and inspect various collection points daily to prevent chaotic collection and purchasing. After some time, we felt this department lacked authority and was not suitable. In recent years, with the opening up and reform, the secondhand goods market has been very active, with multiple collection points: the materials recovery department, supply and marketing cooperatives, street factories, mining enterprises, and unlicensed individual collectors are all involved. Our policy inspection department could only inspect ourselves and couldn't manage society, and chaotic collection and purchasing still occurred. Some thieves sell metal parts to small smelting and casting factories, which immediately melt them down, making it impossible to find any evidence during the recovery process. I thought this matter should be managed by an authoritative department and had the idea of establishing a secondhand goods public security substation. Everyone agreed, so we submitted a report to the higher authorities, expressing our willingness to provide personnel, funds, and equipment for the setup, and requesting the public security authorities to lead the business operations.

"The Benxi City Committee, City Government, and City Public Security Bureau strongly supported this and promptly reported it to the province. The Liaoning Provincial Public Security Bureau quickly responded to their requirements. In March 1985, this institution officially started operations."

Talking about the role of this public security substation, Deputy General Manager Zhang Wanlu said it would be best to let the substation staff explain. He called in a young man named Song Kewei. He said:

"After the substation was established, we first set up a registration system for secondhand goods collection and a suspicious item reporting mechanism. We conducted policy training for the responsible persons, cashiers, and weighers at various collection points, inviting experts from public security, industrial and commercial administration, taxation, and price departments to give lectures. So far, we have trained over 2,500 people. These individuals, after training, are proficient in collection policies, have the ability to distinguish between genuine and counterfeit items, and have a strong sense of responsibility; they are our reliable eyes and ears."

In January 1988, a person dressed as a farmer with an urban household registration came to the Xinbei Collection Station to sell scrap copper wire. The collection staff, following the regulations, conducted the registration and reported the suspicious points to the secondhand goods substation. The substation, based on the registration, found the household head, who provided information that one of his rural relatives had borrowed his household registration book. They followed the clues to the countryside and learned that an iron mine's power line had been stolen, causing the factory to halt production for two days, resulting in a direct loss of over 200,000 yuan. After identification, the type of wire in the circuit matched the one provided by the Xinbei Collection Station. Thus, this serious case of damaging power facilities was quickly solved.

According to Song Kewei, from March 1985 when the substation was established to now, the substation has received 274 reports from various collection stations, preventing the country from suffering economic losses of over 100,000 yuan.

The party secretary of the Benxi City Materials Recovery Company, Cai Jiwu, revealed to us: In a few days, the company will hold a meeting. A group of individuals who have always followed the law in collection and reporting will be rewarded with salary increases, among other rewards. We asked, "What about those who violate collection policies? Are they punished?"

"Punished!" Cai Jiwu replied without hesitation, "We have clear regulations for this. In October 1987, the Gaoyu Collection Station collected several finished copper sleeves and aluminum ingots without following the regulations for registration and reporting. We held a meeting with a thousand people to publicly handle the case: the station manager was administratively detained for seven days; the leaders of the responsible unit, the Mingshan Branch Company manager, and secretary were criticized in a notice."

At this point, Zhang Yujin took over and said, "We are very strict on this point. We are an enterprise, so we naturally want to make money, and we want to make a lot of money. Last year, our junk collection unit made over 800 million yuan in pure profit. We made this money through reform, opening up, and activation. It is legal money. Illegal items, no matter how popular they are in the market or how much money they can make, we do not collect. Otherwise, the losses to industrial and mining enterprises and the state would be too great. So we manage it very strictly, turning the place for fencing stolen goods into a frontline for combating crimes!"

Coming out from the "Junk King," we felt relieved. If various industrial and mining enterprises can strictly manage their raw materials and spare parts, and the materials recovery department strictly controls them, making it impossible for those with dirty hands to steal or fence stolen goods, isn't there great hope for improving public order!

　　破烂王设关记
    ——访本溪市旧货业治安派出所
    王述举　孙殿权
    听说“破烂王”那儿有个“旧货业治安派出所”，觉得挺新鲜，这在全国恐怕还是第一家。新年刚过，我们迎着纷纷瑞雪，来这里探个究竟。
    　　　　一
    “破烂王”是辽宁省本溪市物资回收总公司总经理张玉金的别号。九集电视连续剧《破烂王》，就是以他为原型拍摄的。
    在他那间低矮、简陋的办公室里，他就为什么要成立这么一个派出所向我们作答：
    “你们别小瞧了收破烂儿这个行当，它属于特业呢，政策性很强。社会上有这么两句话流传：‘收破烂儿的什么都收，小偷儿就什么都偷’，‘收破烂儿的和小偷是亲哥们儿’。”
    我们插话说，最近在报纸上看到一篇文章，题目叫《警惕各地的“破烂王”》。他笑了，说：
    “物资回收这个部门弄不好就成了销赃的场所。所以，１９８４年我承包本溪市物资回收总公司，就怕在这方面出漏子。开始，我建议成立一个政策检查科。班子同意了，设３个人，每天跑各个收购门点监督检查，防止乱收乱购。一段时间后，觉得这个部门权威性差，不适应。这些年放开、搞活，旧货业市场很活跃，出现多头收购：物资回收部门收，供销社、街道小工厂、工矿企业也收，一些无证个体收购者更是无孔不入。我们的政策检查科只能检查自己，管不了社会，社会上乱收乱购现象仍然很严重。有的盗窃分子把金属件卖给一些小熔炼厂、铸造厂，马上就入炉熔掉，追赃时连个证物的影儿都看不到。我琢磨这事儿应该有个权威的部门来管，萌生了成立个旧货业治安派出所的想法。大家很同意，就给上级打报告，我们愿意出人出钱出物组建，业务上请公安机关领导。
    “本溪市委、市政府、市公安局对此非常支持，及时上报到省。辽宁省公安厅对他们的要求很快予以批复。１９８５年３月，这个机构正式挂牌执行任务。”
    　　　　二
    说起这个治安派出所的作用，总公司副经理张万录说，最好让派出所的同志谈。他打电话请来名叫宋克伟的小伙子。他说：
    “派出所成立后，首先建立旧货收购登记、可疑物举报制度，对各收购门点的负责人、收款员、检斤员进行政策培训，请公安、工商行政管理、税务、物价等部门的专家讲课。到现在，已培训２５００多人次。这些人经过培训，精通收购政策，具有鉴别真伪能力，责任心强，是我们得力的耳目。”
    １９８８年１月，一个农民打扮的人持城市户口本来到新北收购站卖废铜线。收购人员按规定进行了登记，并将疑点向旧货业派出所作了汇报。派出所根据登记找到户主，户主提供了他的一个农村亲属曾来借过户口本的情况。他们根据线索赶赴农村，了解到当地的一个铁矿的电源线被盗，工厂被迫停产２天，直接损失２万多元。经鉴定，这个电路的电线型号与新北收购站提供的相同。于是，这一破坏电力设施的恶性案件迅速被侦破。
    据宋克伟介绍，从１９８５年３月建所到现在，派出所接到各收购站报案２７４起，使国家免受经济损失１０万多元。
    　　　　三
    本溪市物资回收总公司党委书记柴继武向我们透露：过几天总公司要开一个大会，一批一贯守法收购和举报有功人员，将要受到工资晋级等奖励。我们问：“违反收购政策的罚不？”
    “罚！”柴继武毫不犹豫地说，“这个，我们有明文规定。１９８７年１０月，高峪收购站收购了几个成品铜套、铝锭，没按规定登记，又没有举报。我们召开千人大会公开处理：给予站主任行政拘留７天的处罚；给予该站的领导单位明山分公司经理、书记通报批评。”
    这时张玉金接过话头说：“在这一点上我们非常严格。我们是企业，当然要挣钱，要挣大钱。去年，我们这个收破烂的单位挣了８００多万元纯利润。我们挣的这些钱是靠改革、开放、搞活的威力，挣的是合法的钱。非法的东西，市场上再紧俏，再能挣钱，我们也不收购，否则，工矿企业、国家的损失就太大了。所以我们管得特别严，就是要把销赃的场所变成打击犯罪的前沿阵地！”
    从“破烂王”那儿出来，我们感到欣慰。如果各工矿企业都能对自己的原材料、备品备件严加管理，再加上物资回收部门严格把关，让那些手脚不干净的人偷没有偷处，赃没有销处，治安秩序的好转，不是大有希望吗！
