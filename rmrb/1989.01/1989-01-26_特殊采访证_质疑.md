It was reported that on January 22, the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau issued "special press passes" to political and legal reporters from various news organizations in the city. With these special passes, reporters can interview and supervise the daily work of public security officers throughout the city, and the officers are not allowed to arbitrarily refuse.

The Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau's action is aimed at increasing the transparency of public security work and strengthening anti-corruption efforts, which is commendable.

However, whether it is necessary to adopt the "special press pass" method seems worth considering. Media supervision has no off-limits areas, and public security work is no exception. The minutes of the meeting of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held on December 30, 1988, pointed out: "Using newspapers, television, and radio to publicize legal systems and promote social justice, and to expose illegal and disciplinary actions by party and state officials, is an effective form of media supervision." The "party and state officials" mentioned here, of course, include officials of political and legal agencies. If news organizations need a "special press pass" to interview public security officers, it would create a misunderstanding: public security agencies are not subject to media supervision, and only with their special permission and special passes can reporters conduct interviews and media supervision.

Some may say: This is done because public security agencies need to keep secrets. In fact, it is not only public security agencies that have secrets to keep; economic departments, scientific and technological departments, and so on, all have secrets to keep. There are national laws and regulations on secrecy, and news organizations should comply with these when conducting interviews and reporting. If there are violations, the interviewed units can refuse. If everyone uses the excuse of secrecy and does not recognize the regular press passes and introduction letters of news organizations, only allowing interviews with their own special passes, isn't this adding many restrictions to media supervision?

　　“特殊采访证”质疑
    钟怀
    报载，杭州市公安局１月２２日向该市各新闻单位的政法记者颁发了“特殊采访证”。记者凭专证可以对全市公安干警的日常工作进行采访和监督，公安干警不得随意拒绝。
    杭州市公安局这样做，是为了提高公安工作的透明度，加强廉政建设，其用意是好的。
    但是，要不要采取“特殊采访证”的办法，似乎值得考虑。舆论监督是没有禁区的，对公安工作也不例外。１９８８年１２月３０日中共中央书记处会议纪要指出：“利用报刊、电视、广播来宣传法制和弘扬社会正气，揭露党和国家机关工作人员的违法违纪行为，是一种行之有效的舆论监督。”这里所说的“党和国家机关工作人员”，当然包括政法机关的工作人员。如果新闻单位对公安干警采访凭“特殊采访证”，那就会造成一种误解：公安机关是不受舆论监督的，只有经过他们特别的允许，凭他们发的特殊证件，记者才能采访，舆论才能监督。
    或谓：这样做，是因为公安机关要保密。其实，不独公安机关有密须保，经济部门、科技部门……也都有密须保。国家有关于保密的法律和规定在，新闻单位进行采访和报道自应遵守。如有违反，被采访的单位可以拒绝。要是大家都借口保密而不认新闻单位正规的记者证、介绍信，只有凭自家发的特殊证件才让采访，那不是给舆论监督平添了诸多限制吗？
