Food is the primary concern of people. The food problem has always been the foremost issue for human survival. In recent years, the arable land on Earth has been decreasing, and abnormal weather patterns have frequently occurred, making the food problem increasingly troubling for humanity.

	One Voice of Reduced Yields

Since last year, major grain-producing countries around the world have been reporting poor harvests.

The United States and Canada have successively announced that their grain production in 1988 decreased by 30%. The food situation in the Comecon countries is also grim. The grain production in the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries has dropped to 8 billion tons, a decrease of about 5%. China's grain production, which surpassed 4 billion tons in 1984, has been sluggish, and 1988 saw another decrease. The reduced grain production in major grain-producing countries has led to a global decrease in grain output. The Director-General of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, Saouma, stated that the global grain production in 1988 was approximately 4% lower than in 1987, marking the first time in 40 years that production has decreased for two consecutive years. Saouma also warned in a recent speech: "Grain reserves have decreased to the lowest level since the global food crisis in the early 1970s, falling below the minimum level required to ensure food supply."

The decrease in grain production has led to tension in the grain market. American economist Brown predicted: "We will see countries around the world competing to buy American grains." Officials from the International Development Association are concerned that this year, due to high grain prices, grain-producing countries may reduce food aid to poor countries and developing countries. Fifteen countries will face severe food shortages. The Executive Chairman of the World Food Council, Gerald R. Leventhal, said that this year, perhaps 700 million people will face hunger.

	Is It Natural Disaster or Man-Made Catastrophe?

Why is there still a food shortage in today's world? Various countries have conducted deep reflections and found that people are still unable to escape the influence of natural disasters. In 1988, floods and droughts were frequent around the globe, and locusts wreaked havoc. In North America, 43% of arable land was affected by drought; Central America and the Caribbean region were hit by two successive hurricanes; in Asia, after the floods in Bangladesh and India, Pakistan and Thailand were also struck by floods; countries south of the Sahara Desert, known for their droughts, were unexpectedly hit by a massive flood that left tens of thousands of people homeless. After the floods, locusts followed. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization's optimistic estimate is that in 1988, insect pests destroyed 100 million tons of grain.

Water scarcity is also an important factor affecting global grain production. Practice has proven that irrigated land generally yields twice as much as dry land. However, currently, irrigated land worldwide accounts for only 14.5% of arable land. In regions south of the Sahara Desert, this figure is only 2%. The largest freshwater lake in the region, Lake Chad, is facing the danger of drying up, threatening the survival of tens of thousands of people.

Soil erosion is rapidly becoming a significant problem for agricultural production. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization's report states that due to deforestation and land misuse by humans, 6 million hectares of arable land turn into deserts each year worldwide. Even in developed countries like the United States, producing 1 ton of grain requires the loss of 6 tons of topsoil. Obviously, one of the important reasons for the global decrease in grain production is that tens of thousands of acres of farmland are being eroded and destroyed.

Saouma pointed out that this year, the global food situation will be at a critical juncture between ensuring supply and supply shortages. "To meet food needs and restore grain reserves to an acceptable level," global grain production this year must increase by 225 million tons, which means a 13% increase over last year. However, the official from the U.S. Department of Agriculture responsible for daily grain production estimates, Rector, said: "In reality, we will not be able to restore inventory levels in one year."

	Where Is the Way Out?

Some experts believe that to ensure global food security, the only way out is to control population growth and increase grain production efficiency. In the 1970s, the world's population increased by an average of 70 million per year, while in the 1990s, it is estimated to increase by approximately 91 million per year. The growth of grain production cannot keep up with the population growth rate. Such countries account for two-thirds in Africa, about half in Latin America, the Caribbean region, and the Near East, and one-third in the Far East. The per capita grain supply in the world has decreased from 345 kilograms in 1984 to 300 kilograms in 1988. Some predict that in the future, humans may be able to survive like crops by simply basking in the sun. American economist Brown's words seem more realistic: "Whether the world in the 1990s and beyond can achieve a satisfactory balance between food and population may depend more on the efforts of family planning workers than on the efforts of farmers." In the coming years, if the population growth rate is controlled within 2.4%, and the annual grain growth rate is increased to 3.5%, perhaps human life will be better.

To increase grain production efficiency, more investment and agricultural technology improvements are needed. Take India, for example; from 1954 to 1978, over more than 20 years, the grain production increased by 29%, an important reason being the adoption of new agricultural technologies.

Currently, a new green revolution in agriculture is sweeping the world, such as soil-less cultivation, asexual reproduction of plants, and vertical farming, which have been given attention and applied. Additionally, the role of biotechnology in agricultural development is becoming increasingly prominent.

From this, one can foresee that with the continuous enhancement of human ability to transform nature, agricultural production will inevitably make significant breakthroughs.

　　人类的困扰与出路
    ——全球性的粮食问题
    何崇元
    民以食为天。粮食一直是人类生存的首要问题。近年来，地球上的耕地面积日趋减少，又屡次出现异常气候，粮食问题日益困扰着人类。
    　　　　一片减产声
    去年以来，世界主要产粮国纷纷传出歉收的信息。
    美国、加拿大接二连三地宣布：１９８８年，它们的粮食产量减产３成；经互会国家的粮食形势也不妙；苏联、东欧国家的粮食产量减至８亿吨，减少了约５％；中国的粮食生产自１９８４年突破４亿大关以来，一直很不景气，１９８８年又减产。世界主要产粮国减产，引起全球粮食产量下降。联合国粮农组织总干事萨乌马说，１９８８年的世界粮食产量比１９８７年约减少４％，是４０年来第一次连续两年减产。萨乌马在最近的一次讲话中还警告说：“粮食储备已减少到自７０年代初那次世界粮食危机以来的最低点，已处在确保粮食供给所需要的最低水平以下。”
    粮食产量下降导致粮食市场出现紧张气氛。美国经济学家布朗预言：“我们将会看到全世界纷纷竞相购买美国谷物的情景。”国际开发署的官员们担心，今年，由于粮价高昂，粮食生产国向贫穷国家和发展中国家提供的粮食援助会减少。有１５个国家将面临严重的粮食短缺。世界粮食委员会执行主席杰勒得·兰特说，今年恐怕有７亿人要挨饿。
    　　　　是天灾，还是人祸？
    当今世界为何还闹粮荒？世界各国进行了深刻的反思发现，人们至今仍难摆脱自然灾害的影响。１９８８年，全球水灾、旱灾频仍，蝗虫肆虐。北美，４３％的耕地受到旱灾的影响；中美洲和加勒比海地区先后两次遭到飓风的破坏；亚洲，继孟加拉国、印度水灾之后，巴基斯坦、泰国都纷纷被洪水袭击；撒哈拉沙漠以南的一些国家一直以干旱闻名，可于今，特大洪水竟然荡涤了这块枯焦的土地，使数十万人无家可归。水灾过后，蝗虫又接踵而至。联合国粮农组织的乐观估计，１９８８年，虫灾损失了１００万吨粮食。
    缺水也是影响世界粮食产量的重要因素。实践证明，水浇地比旱地的产量一般要高两倍左右。但目前全世界的水浇地仍然只占耕地面积的１４．５％。撒哈拉沙漠以南地区甚至只达到２％。该地区最大的淡水湖乍得湖面临干涸的危险，数十万人的生存已受到威胁。
    土壤侵蚀正迅速成为粮农生产面临的一个重要问题。联合国粮农组织的报告说，由于人类毁林开荒，滥用土地。目前全世界每年有６００万公顷耕地变成沙漠。就连美国这样的发达国家每生产１吨谷物，也要付出６吨表层土的代价。显然，世界粮食减产的一个重要原因是成千上万亩的农田遭受侵蚀和破坏。
    萨乌马指出，今年世界粮食形势将处于保证供应和供应短缺的紧急转折关头。“要满足粮食需要，并使粮食储备恢复到可以接受的水平”，今年世界的粮食生产必须增加２．２５亿吨，这意味着要比去年增产１３％。美国农业部负责每日发表世界农作物产量估计的官员雷克托却说：“实际上我们不会在一年中恢复库存量”。
    　　　　出路在哪里？
    有的专家认为，要保证世界的粮食安全，出路只有控制人口和提高粮食生产率。７０年代，世界人口平均每年增加７０００万，而９０年代，估计每年大约增加９１００万。粮食生产的增长跟不上人口的增长速度。这样的国家在非洲占２／３，在拉丁美洲、加勒比海地区和近东大约占一半，在远东占１／３。世界人均粮食已从１９８４年的３４５公斤下降到１９８８年的３００公斤。有人预测，今后，人类是否也能像庄稼一样晒晒太阳就能活着。美国经济学家布朗的话似乎更现实一些：“世界９０年代及９０年代以后，在粮食和人口之间能否实现一种令人满意的平衡，可能更多地取决于计划生育工作者所作出的努力，而不是取决于农民。”在未来的岁月，如果人口增长率控制在２．４％内，粮食年均增长率提高到３．５％，人类的日子也许会好过一些。
    提高粮食生产率，还要靠增加投入和农业技术的改进。以印度而言，１９５４年到１９７８年的２０多年间，粮食产量所以增加２９％，一个重要原因就是采用了农业新技术。
    目前，新的农业绿色革命正在世界范围内兴起，如，无土栽培、植物无性繁殖以及立体化农业已得到重视和应用。另外，生物工程在农业发展中的作用也越来越引人注目。
    由此，人们可以预见，随着人类改造自然能力的不断增强，农业生产必将发生大的突破。
