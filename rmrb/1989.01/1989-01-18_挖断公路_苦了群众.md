Road Dismantling Causes Hardship for the Public

Last December 14th in the morning, several officials from the Urban-Rural Construction and Environmental Protection Office of Yuekou Town, Tianmen City in our province went to the Yuekou Electrical Equipment Factory to purchase 40 tons of cement. Due to irregular production at the factory's cement plant, only 10 tons were allocated, which made them very dissatisfied.

That same afternoon, a responsible official from the Environmental Protection Office brought over more than 10 workers. Under the pretext of repairing a sewer, they dug up the road in front of the factory's cement plant (as shown in the picture), causing carts coming to fetch cement to detour along the side of the road, trampling over the crops in the farmers' private plots. This left the farmers with grievances they couldn't express.

When dismantling a road, even if it's for repairs, one should at least notify the public in advance and leave a path for convenience. However, the responsible official said, "We never notify anyone for doing such things!"

The next morning, we returned to the site of the dismantled road. The scene was deserted, with no one in sight. The tractors and carts coming to fetch cement were all blocked on one end of the road.

    挖断公路　苦了群众
    去年12月14日上午，我省天门市岳口镇城乡建设环境保护办公室几个同志到岳口电力设备厂购买40吨水泥，由于设备厂水泥分厂生产不正常，只批给了10吨，他们十分不满。
    当天中午，环保办公室的一位负责同志便带来10多个民工，以修下水道为由，将设备厂水泥分厂门前的公路挖断（见图），致使前来拉水泥的板车绕道公路下边，碾着农民自留地里的庄稼通过，害得农民有苦说不出。
    挖断公路，修个什么，事前总应当打声招呼，留个便道，方便群众。可是，那位负责人说：“干这种事我们从来都不打招呼！”
    第二天上午，我们再次来到挖断的公路旁，现场空无一人，前来拉水泥的拖拉机、板车全被挡在公路的一端。
