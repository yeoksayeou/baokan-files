Edition: 2

Taxation is the primary source of national fiscal revenue and an important economic lever and supervisory tool for macroeconomic control. Local governments at all levels must attach great importance to this, support, and strengthen tax work. In the process of rectifying the economic environment, improving economic order, and deepening comprehensive reforms, it is necessary to take effective measures to rectify tax order, strengthen tax management, adhere to the principle of rule of law in taxation, and ensure the collection of national fiscal revenue. To this end, the following decision is made:

1. Strictly enforce national tax laws and thoroughly review and rectify tax exemptions and reductions. National tax laws must be unified, and tax authority cannot be decentralized. The principle of unified taxation must be consistently adhered to without any wavering or flexibility. No region, department, or individual has the right to amend national tax laws or arbitrarily grant tax exemptions and reductions. All tax exemption and reduction regulations made by local governments at all levels must be reviewed item by item. Any regulations that violate tax laws or exceed authority must be immediately corrected; those that improperly grant tax exemptions and reductions within their authority must also cease to be implemented. Tax exemptions and reductions that have expired must be immediately reinstated. For certain special consumer goods and long-term products strictly controlled by the state, tax exemptions and reductions are strictly prohibited. Specific policies for reviewing and rectifying tax exemptions and reductions will be issued separately after approval by the State Council. All tax exemption and reduction regulations made by governments and tax authorities at all levels must be issued in formal documents. Tax authorities have the right to refuse to implement tax exemption and reduction regulations that exceed their authority and must promptly report to higher-level tax authorities. In the future, those who approve tax exemptions and reductions beyond their authority will be strictly dealt with in accordance with the "Provisional Regulations of the State Council on Penalties for Violations of Financial Laws and Regulations."

2. All enterprises, units, and individuals must pay taxes in accordance with tax laws. All operating income of taxpayers, including various incomes obtained from the sale of products (commodities), must be truthfully included in sales income and taxed according to the law. Other taxable incomes and taxable items of taxpayers must be taxed according to relevant tax laws. All taxpayers must register with tax authorities, declare taxes, accept tax inspections, and pay taxes in accordance with the law. All units and individuals with the obligation to withhold and pay taxes must fulfill their withholding and payment obligations.

3. No region or department may intercept, misappropriate, or encroach upon national tax revenues. Enterprises and units must strictly pay taxes in accordance with national tax laws before using their income. Those who intercept, misappropriate, or encroach upon national tax revenues will be dealt with seriously in accordance with the "Provisional Regulations of the State Council on Penalties for Violations of Financial Laws and Regulations" after recovering the taxes, to ensure that national tax revenues are timely and fully remitted to the treasury. Banks at all levels must ensure that national tax revenues are timely and fully remitted to the treasury in accordance with regulations and must not occupy them.

4. Strictly manage accounting books and invoices. All enterprises, units, and individual business operators engaged in production and operation must establish and maintain accounting books in accordance with regulations, use legal vouchers, keep accurate accounts, and correctly calculate. Tax authorities will impose penalties on those who fail to establish and maintain accounting books in accordance with regulations or engage in fraud, tax evasion, and tax avoidance; those with serious circumstances will be ordered by the industrial and commercial administrative authorities to suspend business for rectification or have their business licenses revoked. Without the approval of tax authorities at or above the county level, no enterprise, unit, or individual may print, sell, or accept invoices. Those who violate invoice use and management regulations will be seriously investigated and dealt with in accordance with tax laws.

5. Grant necessary inspection powers to tax authorities. To effectively grasp the tax payment situation of taxpayers and investigate tax evasion and tax avoidance, tax personnel may inspect the sales and tax payment situation of goods in the operating sites of taxpayers; they may also inspect the tax payment situation of goods transported by taxpayers through railway, transportation, civil aviation, and postal and telecommunications departments. In accordance with national regulations, joint inspection stations may be set up with relevant departments at stations, docks, airports, transportation hubs, and commodity distribution centers; in places where joint inspection stations are not set up, tax inspection stations may be set up with the approval of public security authorities to carry out tax inspection tasks.

6. Strengthen the compulsory enforcement powers of tax authorities. After tax authorities legally determine that taxpayers have evaded taxes, failed to pay taxes, or delayed tax payments and they still refuse to pay taxes, late payment fines, and penalties, with the approval of the director of the tax bureau at or above the county level, a formal written notice will be sent to the taxpayer's bank to withhold and remit the taxes. For temporary business operators, part of their goods may be detained in accordance with regulations to ensure tax payment within a limited period; for those who still fail to pay taxes after the deadline, with the approval of the director of the tax bureau at or above the county level, the detained goods may be auctioned to offset the taxes, late payment fines, and penalties that should be paid.

7. Effectively safeguard the normal performance of duties by tax personnel. Those who assault tax authorities, surround, beat, or insult tax personnel, and obstruct tax personnel from performing their duties in accordance with the law will be subject to public security penalties in accordance with the "Provisions of the People's Republic of China on Penalties for Public Order Offenses"; those who commit crimes will be held criminally liable.

8. Further strengthen tax authorities. To ensure that tax authorities independently exercise their powers, the national tax system will implement dual leadership by higher-level tax authorities and the same-level government, with vertical leadership by tax authorities as the main approach. The establishment of organizations, management of cadres, personnel quotas, and expenditure of funds for tax bureaus at the prefecture, city, and county levels will be immediately vertically led by tax bureaus at the provincial, autonomous region, and municipality levels. Relevant matters regarding the vertical leadership of the State Taxation Administration over provincial-level tax authorities will be notified separately. Tax offices are branch organizations of municipal and county tax bureaus and should be established in accordance with economic districts.

9. Strengthen the propaganda and social supervision of taxation, and do a good job in assisting and protecting taxation. Various propaganda tools should be used to vigorously publicize tax policies and laws and improve the tax awareness of taxpayers. Public security, financial, railway, transportation, civil aviation, postal and telecommunications departments, as well as enterprises, enterprise supervisory departments, units, and individuals, must effectively support and cooperate with the work of tax authorities. The masses should be mobilized to safeguard national taxation, and those who assist and protect taxation should be commended and rewarded.

10. Tax authorities must be clean and upright. Tax authorities at all levels must adhere to principles, administer justice, and strictly implement national tax laws and regulations. Tax personnel must not accept gifts from taxpayers, use their authority to purchase goods at low prices, accept bribes, borrow money or items from taxpayers, or arbitrarily grant tax exemptions and reductions. Tax authorities at all levels must establish a reporting system and actively accept public supervision. Those who embezzle, accept bribes, undercollect, or fail to collect taxes, as well as those who commit dereliction of duty, will be strictly investigated and severely punished in accordance with the law.

This decision does not apply to the collection and management of foreign-related taxes.

　　国务院关于整顿税收秩序加强税收管理的决定
    （一九八八年十二月二十七日）
    税收是国家财政收入的主要来源，是国家进行宏观调控的重要经济杠杆和监督手段。各省、自治区、直辖市人民政府对此要高度重视，支持和加强税收工作。在治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序和全面深化改革中，必须采取有力措施，整顿税收秩序，加强税收管理，坚持以法治税，切实保障国家财政收入。为此，特作如下决定：
    一、严格执行国家税法，认真清理整顿减税免税。国家税法必须统一，税权不能分散，统一税法的原则必须始终如一地坚持而不能有任何动摇和变通。任何地区、部门和个人都无权变更国家税法，不得乱开减税免税的口子。地方各级人民政府所做的减免税规定，都要逐项审查。凡违反税法规定和超越权限的，要立即纠正；在管理权限以内减税免税不当的，也应停止执行。定期减免税到期的，要立即恢复征税。对国家严格控制的某些特殊消费品、长线产品，一律不得减税免税。具体清理整顿减税免税的政策规定，经国务院批准后另行下达。各级政府和税务机关所做的减税免税规定，都必须下达正式文件。税务机关对超越权限的减税免税规定有权拒绝执行，并及时向上级税务机关报告。今后，对越权批准减税免税的，要严格按照《国务院关于违反财政法规处罚的暂行规定》严肃处理。
    二、企业、单位和个人都必须依照税法规定纳税。对于纳税人取得的一切经营收入，包括随同产品（商品）销售取得的各种收入，都必须如实计入销售收入照章征税。对于纳税人取得的其他应税收入和从事其他应税项目，都要按照有关税法规定征税。一切纳税人，都要按照税法规定办理税务登记，进行纳税申报，接受税务检查，依法缴纳税款。凡有代扣代缴义务的单位和个人，都要认真履行代扣代缴义务。
    三、任何地区、部门都不得截留、挪用、挤占国家税款。企业、单位取得的收入，应当严格按照国家税法规定先缴纳税款。对截留、挪用、挤占国家税款的，除追缴税款外，要按照《国务院关于违反财政法规处罚的暂行规定》严肃处理，保证国家税收及时足额入库。各级银行应按规定保证国家税款及时足额划解入库，不得占用。
    四、严格帐簿、发票管理。一切从事生产经营的企业、单位和个体经营者，都必须按照规定建立健全帐簿，使用合法凭证，如实记帐，正确核算。对不按规定建帐、记帐或弄虚作假、偷税漏税的，税务机关要按照有关规定给予处罚；情节严重的，由工商行政管理机关令其停业整顿或吊销营业执照。未经县级或县级以上税务机关批准，任何企业、单位和个人都不得自行印制、出售和承印发票。对违反发票使用、管理规定的，应按税法规定严肃查处。
    五、赋予税务机关必要的检查权。为了有效地掌握纳税人纳税情况，查处偷税漏税行为，税务人员可以到纳税人的经营场所依法检查商品货物的销售和纳税情况；可以检查纳税人在铁道、交通、民航、邮电等部门运寄商品、货物的纳税情况。按照国家有关规定可以在车站、码头、机场、交通要道和货物集散地，会同有关部门设置联合检查站；未设联合检查站的地方，经公安机关批准，也可以单独设置税务检查站，执行税收稽查任务。
    六、强化税务机关的强制执行权力。纳税人偷税漏税和拖欠税款经税务机关依法认定后，仍拒绝纳缴税款和滞纳金、罚款的，经县（市）以上（含县、市）税务局长批准，正式书面通知纳税人开户银行扣缴入库。对临时经营者，可以按照规定扣留纳税人的部分货物，限期缴纳；对逾期仍未缴纳的，经县（市）以上（含县、市）税务局长批准，可将所扣留的货物变价抵缴其应缴纳的税款、滞纳金、罚款。
    七、切实保障税务人员正常履行公务。对冲击税务机关，围攻、殴打、侮辱税务人员，干扰税务人员依法执行公务的，公安机关应依照《中华人民共和国治安管理处罚条例》的规定给予治安处罚；构成犯罪的，依法追究刑事责任。
    八、进一步加强税务机关。为了保证税务机关独立行使职权，全国税务系统实行上级税务机关和同级政府双重领导，以税务机关垂直领导为主。地、市、县税务局的机构设置、干部管理、人员编制和经费开支，应立即由省、自治区、直辖市税务局垂直领导。国家税务局对省级税务机关实行垂直领导的有关事项，将另行通知。税务所是市、县税务局的派出机构，要坚持按经济区划设置。
    九、加强税收的宣传和社会监督，搞好协税护税。要利用各种宣传工具，大力宣传税收政策、法律，提高纳税人的纳税观念。各级公安、金融、铁道、交通、民航、邮电等部门，以及企业、企业主管部门和单位、个人都要切实支持和配合税务机关的工作。要发动广大群众维护国家税收，对协税护税有功人员要给予表彰和奖励。
    十、税务机关要为政清廉。各级税务机关应坚持原则，秉公执法，认真贯彻国家税收法令，依法办事，依率计征。税务人员不准接受纳税人赠送的礼物，不准利用职权压低价格购买商品、索贿受贿，不准向纳税人借钱借物，不准擅自减税免税。各级税务机关要建立举报制度，主动接受群众监督。对贪污受贿，少收或不收税，以及违法渎职的，要严加追究，依法从重处理。
　　本决定不适用于涉外税收的征收管理。　　　　　　　　（新华社发）
