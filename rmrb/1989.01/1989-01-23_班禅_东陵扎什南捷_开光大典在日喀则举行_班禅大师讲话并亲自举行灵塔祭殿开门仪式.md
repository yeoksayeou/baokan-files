The opening ceremony of the "Eastern Tomb Zhashi Namjie" for the Panchen Lama was held in the world-renowned Tashilhunpo Monastery in Shigatse today. Panchen Erdeni Qoinjye Gyaltsen, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Honorary President of the Buddhist Association of China, presided over the ceremony.

Leaders from relevant central departments, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Pabala Gelegdainqie, and leaders from the Party, government, and military of the Tibet Autonomous Region, as well as leaders from Qinghai, Gansu, Sichuan, and Yunnan provinces and some autonomous prefectures and counties under their jurisdiction, and living Buddhas, Geshes, and believers from Tibetan and Mongolian regions, totaling more than 5,000 people, attended the opening ceremony.

At 11 a.m., as the chanting of over 700 monks echoed through the temple's courtyard, believers dressed in festive attire held prayer beads and clasped their hands in devotion, awaiting the start of the opening ceremony.

A procession of monks carrying various ritual instruments blew conch shells, leading a grand religious ceremony to welcome the Panchen Lama, who presided over the opening ceremony of the "Eastern Tomb Zhashi Namjie" from the Fifth to the Ninth Panchen Lamas. High-ranking monks from Tashilhunpo Monastery and living Buddhas from the six major Gelugpa monasteries in Qinghai, Gansu, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Lhasa offered mandalas to the Panchen Lama. Monks from Tashilhunpo Monastery performed debates and sacred dances in the courtyard.

In his speech at the opening ceremony, the Panchen Lama said: As the tenth Panchen Erdeni Qoinjye Gyaltsen, the natural successor of the previous Panchen Lamas, I am deeply moved and my thoughts are endless. All the previous Panchen Erdeni Qoinjyes have loved their country and made outstanding contributions to the great cause of maintaining national unity and ethnic solidarity, as well as solidarity within the Tibetan people.

The Panchen Lama said that the main purpose of rebuilding the Panchen Lama's stupa, which was destroyed during the Cultural Revolution, is to carry forward the spirit of the previous Panchen Lamas in religious purification and practice, protecting and promoting Buddhism, and in politics, adhering to a patriotic stance, striving for the prosperity of the country and the happiness of the people, so as to commemorate the merits of the previous Panchen Lamas.

The Panchen Lama emphasized that the magnificent "Eastern Tomb Zhashi Namjie" stupa and memorial hall is a symbol of the correctness and authenticity of the Chinese Communist Party's policies on ethnic and religious affairs; a symbol of the unity between the Tibetan and Han peoples; a symbol of the patriotism of the Tibetan religious community and the broad masses of monks and people; and a crystallization of the joint efforts of the Tibetan and Han peoples. I am fully convinced that anyone who comes to the "Eastern Tomb" to pay homage, visit, or tour, as long as they respect the facts, will surely understand the essence of the Party's ethnic and religious policies, understand the importance of Tibetan-Han ethnic unity, and understand the significance of adhering to a patriotic stance.

Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and President of the Buddhist Association of China Zhao Puxu sent a congratulatory message for the opening ceremony.

Tibet Autonomous Region Party Committee Secretary Hu Jintao, Vice Minister of the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee Zhang Shengzuo, and representatives from the National People's Congress Ethnic Affairs Committee, the State Ethnic Affairs Commission, the State Administration for Religious Affairs, and the provinces and autonomous regions of Qinghai, Gansu, Sichuan, and Yunnan read congratulatory speeches and presented various gifts at the opening ceremony.

Finally, the Panchen Lama personally conducted the opening ceremony of the stupa and memorial hall, and attendees from various sectors visited and paid homage to the newly built joint stupa of the Fifth to Ninth Panchen Lamas.

    班禅大师讲话并亲自举行灵塔祭殿开门仪式
    新华社日喀则１月２２日电（新华社记者群桑、中央人民广播电台记者旺堆）班禅“东陵扎什南捷”开光大典今天在闻名于世的日喀则扎什伦布寺隆重举行。全国人大常委会副委员长、中国佛教协会名誉会长班禅额尔德尼·确吉坚赞主持了大典仪式。
    中央有关部门的负责人、全国政协副主席帕巴拉·格列朗杰、西藏自治区党政军领导和来自青海、甘肃、四川、云南等省及其所辖的一些自治州、县的负责人，藏、蒙地区的活佛、格西和信教群众５０００多人参加了开光大典。
    上午１１时，当身披袈裟的７００多名僧众的诵经声回荡在寺内跳神院内时，身穿节日盛装的信教群众手持佛珠、双手合十，以虔诚的心情等候灵塔开光大典开始。
    手持各种法器的喇嘛仪仗队吹着法号，以盛大的宗教仪式，迎请主持五世至九世班禅“东陵扎什南捷”开光大典的班禅大师。扎什伦布寺的高僧和青海、甘肃、四川、云南、拉萨三大寺等格鲁派六大寺的活佛向班禅大师敬献了坛城。扎什伦布寺的喇嘛在跳神院内进行辩经和跳神。
    班禅大师在开光大典上讲话说：我本人第十世班禅额尔德尼·确吉坚赞作为历世班禅的当然传承人，心情激动，思绪万千。历世班禅额尔德尼都热爱祖国，在维护祖国统一和民族团结及其藏族内部团结的伟大事业中做出卓越的贡献。
    班禅大师说，我们重建在“文革”中被毁的班禅灵塔的主要目的，就在于发扬历世班禅大师在宗教上净心修持，持护弘扬佛法，在政治上坚持爱国立场，为国运昌隆，人民安乐而努力的精神，以此来纪念历世班禅的恩惠。
    班禅大师强调指出，班禅“东陵扎什南捷”这座宏伟壮观的灵塔祭殿，是中国共产党民族、宗教政策的正确性和真实性的象征；是藏汉两大民族团结的象征；是西藏宗教界和广大僧众人民爱国主义的象征；是藏汉两族人民共同劳动的结晶。我完全相信，凡来到“东陵”这里瞻仰慕拜、参观、游览的人，只要他是尊重事实的，就必然会领悟到党的民族宗教政策的真谛，领悟到藏汉民族团结的重要，领悟到坚持爱国主义立场的意义。
