The Ministry of Water Resources accepts the State Council's criticism and reflects on the mistake of "publicly funded celebrations."

    New China News Agency, Beijing, January 16th - (Reporter Huang Zhenggen) Minister of Water Resources Yang Zhenhuai seriously accepts the State Council's serious criticism and the Audit Office's report of criticism, deeply reflects on the Ministry of Water Resources' erroneous practice of indiscriminately distributing money and goods, and expresses the intention to correct the mistake with concrete actions.

    According to the reporter's understanding, before the National Day last year, the Ministry of Water Resources purchased a batch of fish, meat, eggs, and vegetables for the staff to celebrate the holiday. According to the regulations, the price of the purchased agricultural products should be the same as the price sold to the cadres and staff. However, the Ministry of Water Resources violated the state's financial discipline, using welfare funds to subsidize each person 46 yuan, resulting in the mistake of "publicly funded celebrations."

    On January 14th, the newspaper published reports criticizing some central state organs for publicly funded celebrations, and the State Council made serious criticisms, including the Ministry of Water Resources. That afternoon, Yang Zhenhuai presided over an emergency meeting at the Ministry of Water Resources, first making a self-reflection. He said: "The responsibility for indiscriminately distributing money and goods lies with me. Do not blame each other or blame others. This shows that our policy level is not high, and we have not seriously implemented the relevant regulations of the State Council. I should make the reflection." He also said: "Comrades Li Baohua and Qian Zhengying, who were in charge of the work of the Ministry of Water Resources, all advocated frugality and simplicity, setting a good example for us. In this regard, I have not done enough, and I have not maintained the good tradition. My mood is very heavy."

    The Ministry of Water Resources has decided: From now on, especially during this year's Spring Festival, we must resolutely not indiscriminately distribute money and goods. Already ordered items should be returned in full. We must, with concrete actions, achieve a clean and honest government that gains the trust of the people; the cadres of the organs must take the lead in correcting the wrong trends.

### 水利部接受国务院批评  检讨搞“公费过节”错误

　　水利部接受国务院批评
    检讨搞“公费过节”错误
    新华社北京１月１６日电  （记者黄正根）水利部部长杨振怀认真对待国务院的严肃批评和审计署的通报批评，深刻检查了水利部滥发钱物的错误做法，表示要以实际行动改正错误。
    据记者了解，去年国庆节前夕，水利部代职工购买了一批鱼、肉、蛋、菜过节。按规定，本来应该是买来的农副产品是多少价钱，卖给干部、职工也是多少价钱。但是，水利部违反了国家财经纪律，用福利费补贴每人４６元，造成“公费过节”的错误。
    １月１４日，报纸刊登了一些中央国家机关搞公费过节，国务院对此提出严肃批评的报道，其中就有水利部。当日下午，杨振怀在水利部主持召开紧急会议，首先自己作了检讨。他说：“滥发钱物的责任在我，不要互相埋怨，责怪别人。这说明我们政策水平不高，对国务院的有关规定没有认真执行，应该由我来作检讨。”他还说：“李葆华、钱正英同志主管水利部工作期间，都是提倡艰苦朴素的，给我们树立了好的作风。在这方面我抓得不够，没有保住好传统，我的心情很沉重。”
    水利部已作出决定：从现在起，特别是今年春节，坚决不滥发钱物，已经订购的东西，该退的全部退掉。要以实际行动做到党政机关为政清廉，取信于民；机关干部要带头纠正不正之风。
