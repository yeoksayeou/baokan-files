	The comprehensive educational reform in Stenyang, a national pilot city, has begun. According to Xinhua News Agency, Stenyang, the first batch of 60 primary and secondary schools in 10 counties and districts under its jurisdiction, have started implementing a series of reforms focusing on the principal responsibility system, optimization of personnel, and structural salary system.

	The reforms in Stenyang City are carried out in accordance with the requirements of the State Education Commission and in combination with the actual situation of the city. The main approach is to simultaneously implement the reform of the school leadership system and the internal labor, personnel, and distribution systems. All 60 primary and secondary schools in the first batch of reforms in the city implement the principal responsibility system. The principal signs a three-year term target responsibility contract with the district education bureau. The district delegates authority over personnel, distribution, rewards and punishments, organizational structure, and professional settings to the schools. All pilot schools implement a full-time employment system, with fixed quotas, fixed personnel, fixed positions, and fixed responsibilities, optimizing the combination and separating excess personnel. The city implements a fixed total salary system for schools, with schools implementing a structural salary system. The municipal government provides financial subsidies to schools implementing the reforms, temporarily setting the average monthly salary for middle schools at 150-170 yuan and for primary schools at 130-150 yuan (excluding various policy subsidies). The district education bureau then determines the specific standards based on the quality of teaching in each school.

　　全国试点城市　改革内容配套
    沈阳拉开综合教改序幕
    据新华社沈阳１月７日电  （通讯员梁昕秋、记者刘欣欣）新年伊始，我国教育综合改革试点城市沈阳在所属１０个县区的６０所中小学校，开始实施以校长负责制、人员优化组合和结构工资为主要内容的配套改革。
    沈阳市实施这些改革是按照国家教委的要求并结合本市实际情况而进行的，改革的主要做法是坚持学校领导体制改革和校内劳动、人事、分配制度改革配套进行。全市第一批改革的６０所中小学校都实行校长负责制，校长同区教育局签订３年任期目标责任状，区里对学校下放人事、分配、奖惩、机构和专业设置等项权力。试点学校全部实行全员聘任制，定编、定员、定岗、定责，优化组合，剥离富余人员。市里对学校实行工资总额包干，校内实行结构工资。市政府对实施改革的学校，从财政上给以补贴，暂定中学人均月工资为１５０—１７０元，小学为１３０—１５０元（不包括各种政策性补贴）。然后由区教育局根据各校教学好坏确定具体标准。
