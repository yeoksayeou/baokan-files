Vice Premier and Chairman of the State Council's Leading Group for Water Resources and Soil Conservation, Tian Jiyun, emphasized that water and soil are fundamental natural resources essential for the nation's existence and development. Effective measures must be taken to protect and rationally develop and utilize China's water and soil resources, which is a fundamental national policy.

Tian Jiyun made these remarks at a meeting of the State Council's Leading Group for Water Resources and Soil Conservation held today.

After listening to the report by Yang Zhenhuai, Minister of Water Resources and Vice Chairman of the Leading Group, Tian Jiyun pointed out: Water is an extremely important natural resource. How it is developed, utilized, and protected affects not only economic development but also the stability of people's lives. With the development of the economy, population growth, and the improvement of people's living standards, higher demands will be placed on the development and utilization of water resources. Therefore, strengthening the management and protection of water resources has become an urgent issue for the national economy and social development. He also said that soil conservation is an important part of land management. China's soil erosion is severe and widespread. Currently, some places still have serious problems of reckless cultivation, deforestation, and mining, as well as road construction, which accelerate soil erosion. In many places, the situation is one of treating and damaging simultaneously. Effective measures must be taken to address this.

Tian Jiyun also made specific requirements for strengthening water resource management and soil conservation work. He said that the current focus of water resource work is to strictly enforce the Water Law and adhere to the principle of water governance through law. Reform must be deepened to gradually rationalize the water resource management system. The state implements a system of unified management combined with level-specific and department-specific management, that is, to transition from the past "multiple agencies managing water" to unified water resource management. While strengthening the unified management and protection of water resources, the Ministry of Water Resources should also strengthen its service work for all parties. The development and utilization of water resources should strictly follow the principles of comprehensive planning, overall consideration, integrated utilization, and emphasis on benefits, to achieve the maximum economic, social, and environmental benefits with the least investment, and not to act arbitrarily. At the same time, water resources should adhere to the principle of combining development and utilization with protection, to achieve planned and economical water use. To ensure the rational use of water resources, the state will implement a water use permit system for direct water extraction from rivers, lakes, or groundwater.

When discussing the current soil conservation work, Tian Jiyun pointed out that legislation should be accelerated to gradually shift soil conservation work to prevention as the primary focus. Key areas should be treated in a planned manner, and the work of household-based small watershed treatment should be continued. In the treatment process, long-term and short-term benefits should be balanced, and the relationship between ecological benefits and economic benefits should be handled properly. He also required local authorities to strengthen the leadership of soil conservation work, establish a responsibility system, and strengthen inspections and supervision.

Tian Jiyun emphasized that soil conservation work should not be done in isolation but should be integrated with agricultural development, afforestation, poverty alleviation, and other work for comprehensive planning and treatment. For the severe pollution of some rivers and lakes, Tian Jiyun required local authorities and departments to take effective measures to solve the problem within a set time.

Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Advisor to the Leading Group for Water Resources and Soil Conservation, Qian Zhengying, also spoke at the meeting.

　　田纪云要求采取有效措施
  　切实保护和合理开发利用水土资源
    强调水土保持工作不要“单打一”要综合治理
    新华社北京１月５日电  （记者张建军）国务院副总理、全国水资源与水土保持工作领导小组组长田纪云强调，一个是水，一个是土，这是立国、生存之本，是最基本的自然资源，要采取有效措施保护和合理开发利用我国水土资源，这是我们的基本国策。
    田纪云是在今天主持召开全国水资源与水土保持工作领导小组全体会议时讲这番话的。
    在听取了水利部部长、全国水资源与水土保持工作领导小组副组长杨振怀的汇报后，田纪云指出：水是一种极为重要的自然资源，开发利用和保护的情况如何，不仅关系到经济发展，而且关系到人民生活安定的问题。随着经济的发展、人口的增长和人民生活水平的提高，对水资源的开发利用将提出更高的要求。因此，加强水资源的管理和保护，已成为国民经济和社会发展亟待解决的重要问题。他还说，水土保持是国土整治的一项重要内容。我国水土流失情况比较严重，流失面积分布广。现在一些地方乱垦滥伐和乱开矿、乱筑路现象仍十分严重，加速了水土流失，不少地方是边治理、边破坏，对此，必须采取有效措施加以整治。
    田纪云还分别就加强水资源管理和水土保持工作提出了具体要求。他说，当前水资源工作的中心是认真执行《水法》，坚持以法治水。要深化改革，逐步理顺水资源管理体制。国家对水资源实行统一管理与分级、分部门管理相结合的制度，也就是要从过去的“多龙治水”向水资源统一管理转变。水利部在加强水资源统一管理和保护工作的同时，要加强对各方面的服务工作。开发利用水资源，要认真贯彻全面规划、统筹兼顾、综合利用、讲求效益的原则，以最少的投资取得最大的经济、社会和环境效益，不能各行其是。同时对水资源要坚持开发利用与保护相结合的方针，做到计划用水、节约用水。为了保证水资源的合理利用，对从江河、湖泊或地下直接取水，国家将实行用水许可制度。
    田纪云在谈到当前的水土保持工作时指出，首先要加快立法工作，逐步将水土保持工作转到预防为主上来。要有计划地进行重点治理，并继续抓好户包小流域治理工作。在治理中，要立足长远、抓好当前，处理好当前与长远的关系、生态效益与经济效益的关系。他还要求各地切实加强对水土保持工作的领导，建立责任制，加强检查、监督。
    田纪云强调，水土保持工作不要“单打一”，可以同农业开发、植树造林、扶贫等工作结合起来，进行统筹规划、综合治理。对一些江河湖泊遭受的严重污染，田纪云要求各地、各部门切实采取有力措施，限期加以解决。
    全国政协副主席、全国水资源与水土保持工作领导小组顾问钱正英也在会上讲了话。
