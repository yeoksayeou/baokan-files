The implementation of exclusive export management for Taixi coal

Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, January 9th - (Reporter Wu Guoqing) According to the Ningxia branch of the China Coal Import and Export Corporation, in 1988, the export of Taixi coal saw significant growth, with Ningxia and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Regions together exporting over 500,000 tons. In 1989, Taixi coal will be exclusively managed for export by the China Coal Import and Export Corporation.

Taixi coal is mined in the depths of the Helan Mountains in northwestern China's Ningxia Rujugou Mine Area. It is a high-quality anthracite coal with low ash, low sulfur, low phosphorus, and high calorific value, making it a standout in the international market and earning it the title of "King of Coal."

After more than 20 years of development and construction, the mine area has established state-owned coal mines such as the Rujugou Coal Mine and the Dafeng Open-Pit Mine, as well as several local coal mines, with an annual production capacity of over 4 million tons of raw coal. It also has a Taixi Coal Washing Plant capable of washing 2.1 million tons of coal. Within the 100-mile Rujugou mine area, a number of coal machinery manufacturing, electromechanical manufacturing, and coal processing plants have been built, making it a major coal industry base in the northwest with a complete range of products.

Currently, Taixi coal is exported to more than 10 countries and regions, including Belgium, the Netherlands, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, West Germany, and Japan.

It is reported that to change the situation where multiple entities manage and export Taixi coal, starting this year, the state will implement an exclusive export management system for Taixi coal.

　　太西煤实行出口专营制
    新华社银川１月９日电  （记者吴国清）据中国煤炭进出口总公司宁夏分公司介绍，１９８８年我国太西煤出口有较大增长，宁夏和内蒙古两个自治区共出口５０多万吨。１９８９年太西煤将改由中国煤炭进出口总公司独家专营。
    太西煤产于我国西北部贺兰山深处的宁夏汝箕沟矿区，它是一种优质无烟煤，具有低灰、低硫、低磷、高发热量等特点，在国际市场上独占鳌头，被称为“煤中之王”。
    经过２０多年的开发建设，现在矿区已建起了汝箕沟煤矿、大峰露天矿等国营煤矿和一些地方煤矿，形成了年产原煤４００多万吨的能力，并有了一座可入洗２１０万吨煤的太西洗煤厂。在汝箕沟百里矿区内，还建起了一批煤炭机械制造、机电制造、煤炭加工工厂，使这里成为西北较大的门类齐全的煤炭工业基地。
    目前，太西煤已出口比利时、荷兰、法国、英国、意大利、联邦德国、日本等１０多个国家和地区。
    据悉，为改变太西煤出口方面多家经营、多头对外的局面，从今年起，国家对太西煤出口实行专营制。
