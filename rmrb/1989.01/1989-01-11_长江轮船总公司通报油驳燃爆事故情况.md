Longjiang Shipping Company Reports on Oil Barge Explosion Incident

A reporter from this newspaper in Wuhan reports: Longjiang Shipping Company held a press conference this afternoon to report on the oil barge explosion incident.

The former general manager and veteran chief economist, Gu Yonghuai, cautiously discussed the cause of the accident, stating it as his "personal opinion": the fleet encountered a sandbar in the midstream shallow water area, causing a broken mooring line, which led to the explosion and fire. Currently, no other human factors have been found to cause this accident. "Of course," they said with great caution, "we cannot rule out other unexpected causes."

This "old Yangtze" who has been on the Yangtze River for 38 years and has long been in charge of Longjiang safety work said that in the dry season in the midstream of the Yangtze River, ships often run aground due to sandbars, and broken mooring lines due to running aground are also common. However, a broken mooring line causing an oil ship to explode and burn is unprecedented in the history of Longjiang. As for why a broken mooring line would cause an explosion, he also "could not figure it out."

Gu Yonghuai further analyzed that, in general, a fully loaded oil barge (i.e., full load) is much less dangerous than an empty barge. Because an empty barge contains a large amount of flammable gas, a collision can easily cause an explosion, while a full load, even if a collision occurs, will not explode. However, this time, due to the influence of the water depth of the navigation channel, the oil barge was "half-loaded." Now it seems that a half-loaded barge is more dangerous than an empty barge, and the consequences are also more severe. This is because an empty barge may explode but will not burn, while a half-loaded barge not only easily causes an explosion but also burns for a long time after the explosion, causing greater harm and loss.

Regarding the Yangtze River fire fighting, Gu Yonghuai expressed regret: such a large company does not even have one fire-fighting ship. He said the reason is that after the reform of the Longjiang system, the port and navigation were separated, and the originally scarce fire-fighting forces were transferred to the port, leaving the shipping company without any fire-fighting facilities.

It is reported that the investigation team dispatched by the State Council has arrived in Wuhan and is investigating the cause of the accident.

Further news: According to the public security department of Hubei Province, the remains of the last missing firefighter in the rescue of the Yangtze River oil barge fire have been found in the hold of the 63040 oil barge.

The firefighters who sacrificed their lives in this incident are: Tian Xiaolin, Cheng Jingfa, Li Shengmin, Zhou Jianrong, Cheng Shijin, Zhang Jiahua, Hong Xiaobing, Jiang Guixin.

### 长江轮船总公司通报油驳燃爆事故情况

　　长江轮船总公司通报油驳燃爆事故情况
    本报武汉１月１０日电  记者龚达发报道：长江轮船总公司今天下午举行新闻发布会，通报油驳燃爆事故有关情况。
    前任总经理、老资格的总经济师顾永怀谨慎地谈了事故原因，声称是“个人看法”：船队在中游浅水区“吃了沙包”，造成断缆，引起爆炸、燃烧。目前还没有发现其他人为原因造成这次事故。“当然”，他们十分有分寸地说，“也不排除还有意外原因。”
    这位在长江上“漂”了３８年、长期主管长航安全工作的“老长江”又说，长江中游在枯水季节，船舶“吃沙包”、搁浅，是经常发生的，由于搁浅造成断缆也是经常发生的。但断缆造成油船爆炸、燃烧，在长航史上尚属首次。至于为什么断缆会发生爆炸，他也“吃不透”。
    顾永怀进一步分析说，一般而言，运载原油重驳（即满载）比空驳危险性小得多。因为空驳里有大量易燃气体，发生碰撞容易爆炸，而满载即使发生碰撞也不会爆炸。而这次受航道水深影响，油驳是“半载”。现在看来，半载比空驳更危险，后果也更严重。这是因为空驳发生爆炸但不会燃烧，半载则不仅容易引起爆炸，炸后还会长时间燃烧，危害损失也就更大。
    谈到长江消防，顾永怀不无遗憾：我们这么大的公司，竟没有一条消防船。他说原因是长航体制改革后，港、航分家，原来少得可怜的消防力量划归港口，轮船公司就没有消防设施了。
    据悉，国务院责成交通部组成的调查组已抵武汉，着手调查事故原因。
    又讯　据湖北省公安部门介绍，在扑救长江油驳火灾中失踪的最后一名消防战士的遗骸，已在６３０４０号油驳舱内找到。
    这次牺牲的消防战士是：田小林、程敬发、李胜民、周建荣、程仕锦、张家华、洪小兵、姜桂新。
