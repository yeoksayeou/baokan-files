In November 1988, we conducted an investigation into the schistosomiasis prevention and control situation in the Hanle, Anxiang, Lixian, Jinzhou, Dingcheng, and Hejiashan areas of Changde, Hunan. We discovered that the "scourge" that was eliminated in the 1960s has returned.

The area infested with Oncomelania hupensis has increased. In 1971, Hanle County had no Oncomelania hupensis, but now the entire county has approximately 9,900 mu of infested area. In 1981, Anxiang County had 149 mu of infested area, which has now expanded to 16,147 mu. Before 1980, Dingcheng District had virtually no snails, but by October 1988, the infested area had reached 1,893 mu. In the end of 1979, Lixian County had basically eliminated Oncomelania hupensis, but by October 1988, 14,067 mu of infested area had been discovered.

The epidemic area has expanded. In recent years, the area affected by schistosomiasis in this region has been increasing. Anxiang County now has 20 townships and 198 villages, affecting nearly 300,000 people. Lixian County now has 11 townships and 149 villages, affecting nearly 230,000 people. Dingcheng District now has 6 townships and 256 villages, with a population of 372,000. Hanle County now has 13 townships and 36 villages, with a population of nearly 200,000.

The number of infected people is rising. Recently, some areas have seen a sharp increase in the number of schistosomiasis patients. The first schistosomiasis prevention station in Dingcheng District conducted a survey of three townships and one district in 1988, discovering 392 schistosomiasis patients, of whom 226 were newly discovered cases. In Anxiang County, 370 out of 420 people in Tanzi Village, Anfu Township, were found to have schistosomiasis. All 23 officials in the Anxiang County government were found to have the disease. At the same time, the situation of livestock infected with schistosomiasis in some areas is also very serious.

The main reasons for the current situation are:

Weak organizational leadership. The schistosomiasis prevention leadership groups in the epidemic areas are not well-established, with some existing in name only. Propaganda and education are not thorough, and the awareness and knowledge of schistosomiasis prevention among cadres and the masses are lacking. The relevant departments have not timely studied and formulated plans for schistosomiasis control, and the schistosomiasis prevention work is carried out by schistosomiasis prevention personnel alone.

Inadequate prevention and control funds. Since 1982, the schistosomiasis prevention funds have been managed through a contract responsibility system, which has not changed for 7 years. However, in these 7 years, the price of molluscicides has doubled, and personnel expenses have increased by 96.21%. Due to the serious shortage of funds, the schistosomiasis prevention departments can only "eat what they can afford and do what they can with the money they have."

Lack of coordination among departments. Some counties, cities, and districts do not cooperate in the border areas but instead blame and shift responsibilities to each other. The transportation, water conservancy, and agricultural departments each do their own thing, with some only focusing on the construction of their own systems and not caring about schistosomiasis prevention work. Some only consider economic benefits and ignore social benefits. For example, many sluices and canals lack safety measures; some places blindly transplant reeds from other places without quarantine, causing Oncomelania hupensis to breed and spread locally.

Difficulties in schistosomiasis prevention work. Schistosomiasis prevention personnel work in lakes and marshes, eat hurried meals, inspect Oncomelania hupensis, and collect feces, often being looked down upon. Schistosomiasis prevention personnel are also easily infected with schistosomiasis. According to reports from Hanle County, out of 271 schistosomiasis prevention personnel, 198 have been infected with schistosomiasis. In addition, some people do not heed warnings and often secretly go to high-risk areas to catch aquatic plants and fish. Some refuse treatment, making it difficult for schistosomiasis prevention personnel to do their work.

### “瘟神”泛滥  亟待治理

　　“瘟神”泛滥  亟待治理
    １９８８年１１月，我们调查了湖南常德地区的汉寿、安乡、澧县、津市及鼎城、贺家山等地的血吸虫病防治情况，发现６０年代送走的“瘟神”又回来了。
    钉螺面积增加。汉寿县１９７１年没有钉螺，目前全县有钉螺面积约９９００亩；安乡县１９８１年有钉螺面积１４９亩，现在已扩大到１６１４７亩；鼎城区１９８０年以前基本无螺，到１９８８年１０月，有螺面积已达１８９３亩；澧县在１９７９年末基本消灭了钉螺，到１９８８年１０月，查出有螺面积１４０６７亩。
    流行区域扩大。这个地区，近几年血吸虫病流行区的面积越来越大，安乡县已达２０个乡镇、１９８个村，近３０万人口；澧县已达１１个乡、１４９个村，近２３万人；鼎城区已达６个乡镇、２５６个村，人口达３７．２万人；汉寿县已达１３个乡镇、３６个村，人口近２０万。
    发病人数上升。近来，一些地区血吸虫病患者剧增。鼎城区第一血防站１９８８年抽查了三乡一镇的血防情况，查出患血吸虫病的３９２人，其中新发现的有２２６人。安乡县安福乡潭子口村６、７、８组的４２０人中，患血吸虫病的达３７０人，安德乡政府机关干部２３人，经检查人人患有血吸虫病。同时，一些地区的牲畜患血吸虫病的情况也十分严重。
    造成目前状况的主要原因是：
    组织领导不得力。疫区血防领导小组不健全，有的名存实亡；宣传教育不深入，干部群众血防观念淡薄，防护知识缺乏；各级领导机关未及时研究制订治理血吸虫的规划，血防工作仅仅由血防人员孤军作战。
    防治经费不落实。血防经费自１９８２年以来一直实行经营包干的办法，已经７年未变。而这７年，灭螺药物价格已上涨１倍，人员经费增加了９６．２１％。由于经费严重不足，血防部门只好“看菜吃饭，按钱办事。”
    部门配合不协调。一些县、市、区在交界地带不是协同作战，而是互相扯皮、推诿。交通、水利、农牧部门各干各的，有的只管自己系统的建设，不管血防工作；有的只讲经济效益，不顾社会效益。例如，许多船闸、渠道无安全措施；一些地方盲目移栽外地芦苇，不检疫，造成钉螺在本地繁殖、蔓延。
    血防工作难开展。血防人员蹲的湖洲滩，吃的囫囵饭，查的是钉螺，收的是粪便，常常被人看不起。血防人员还很容易感染血吸虫病，据汉寿县反映，全县２７１名血防人员，感染血吸虫病的有１９８人。此外，一些群众不听劝阻，经常偷偷上易感染地带打菁捕鱼，有的拒绝治疗，给血防人员的工作带来困难。
