Unjustly Shut Down, Finally Gets a Fair Verdict
The Revival of the Linfen Pingyang Company

		People's Daily reports: Correspondent Wang Aisheng reports: On January 13, 1988, the third page of this newspaper published an article titled "The Rise and Fall of the Pingyang Technology Development Company," which reflected the situation of the Pingyang Technology Development Company in Linfen City, Shanxi Province, being unjustly closed and facing various difficulties. The Linfen Municipal Party Committee and the Linfen Municipal Committee paid close attention to this incident. After repeated investigations and trials, the Linfen Municipal Party Committee Standing Committee meeting studied and, on December 3, 1988, made a fair conclusion regarding this company.

		The Pingyang Technology Development Company was established in June 1984. At its peak, it united more than 500 scientific and technological personnel and successively undertook technical consulting for 150 million yuan worth of projects. However, several complaints alleged that the company was "illegally operating," "making profits from reform," and that the company's general manager, Jiao Minghua, was "embezzling," etc. In January 1986, the company was forced to cease operations.

		The investigation conclusion of the Linfen Municipal Party Committee and the Linfen Municipal Committee stated: "The Pingyang Technology Development Company was established by Comrade Jiao Minghua as a mass science and technology consultation organization under the reform of the science and technology system. From the moment it obtained a business license, it has had legal status. Since its establishment, the company has done a lot of work and has played an active role in the city's science and technology consultation activities and economic and technological development."

		Thus, the Pingyang Technology Development Company case was rectified.

		It is reported that the Pingyang Technology Development Company has recently hired four retired scientific and technological personnel and is preparing to reopen. It has also established contact with dozens of private science and technology consultation institutions across the country. The Linfen Municipal Government plans to provide appropriate economic assistance to the company.

　　无端被关停业　终获公正裁断
    临汾平阳公司死而复生
    本报讯  记者王艾生报道：本报１９８８年１月１３日第三版发表《平阳技术开发公司兴衰记》一文，反映山西省临汾市平阳技术开发公司被无端关闭停业、遭受种种阻难的情况。中共临汾地委、临汾市委对这一事件很关心。经反复调查、审理，临汾市委常委会议研究，于１９８８年１２月３日对这一公司作出了公正的结论。
    平阳技术开发公司成立于１９８４年６月。全盛时期，它联合了５００多名科技人员，先后平分了１．５亿元投资工程的技术咨询。然而，几份“状子”说这个公司是“非法经营”、“发改革横财”，说公司总经理焦明华“贪污”等等。１９８６年１月，公司被迫停业。
    中共临汾地委、临汾市委的调查结论说：“平阳技术开发公司是焦明华同志在科技体制改革的形势下成立的群众性科技咨询组织，从取得营业执照之日起，即取得了合法资格。该公司成立以来，做了很多工作，对于我市科技咨询活动和经济技术发展起了积极作用。”
    至此，平阳技术开发公司一案得以平反。
    据悉，平阳技术开发公司最近已聘请四名离退休科技人员，着手进行重新开业的准备工作，并同全国数十家民办科技咨询机构取得联系。临汾市政府拟给该公司适当的经济补助。
