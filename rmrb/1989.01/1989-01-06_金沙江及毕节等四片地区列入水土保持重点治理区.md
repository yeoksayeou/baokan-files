According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 5th - (Reporter Zhang Jianjun) With the approval of the State Council, China has added the upper reaches of the Jinsha River and Bijie region, the middle and lower reaches of the Jialing River, the Longnan region, and the Three Gorges region to the list of key areas for soil and water conservation. This was announced by Yang Zhenhuai, Deputy Director of the National Water Resources and Soil Conservation Work Leading Group and Minister of Water Resources, at the first meeting of this leading group today.

In 1982, the State Council approved the designation of eight regions, including the Wuding River, Sanchuan River, Huangpu River, Dingxi County in the Yellow River basin, the upper reaches of the Liuhe River in the Liaohe River basin, the upper reaches of the Yongding River in the Haihe River basin, the Gezhouba Reservoir area, and Xingguo County in the Yangtze River basin, as key areas for soil and water conservation, covering 43 counties (banners). Yang Zhenhuai pointed out at today's meeting that after several years of treatment, these eight regions have completed the treatment of 150,000 square kilometers. Since the founding of the People's Republic, by 1987, the country had initially treated 495,000 square kilometers of soil erosion.

Yang Zhenhuai pointed out that the current prominent problem is that while treatment is being carried out, new soil erosion is being caused by the cultivation of steep slopes, the indiscriminate felling of trees, the destruction of grasslands, and especially with the development of transportation, mining, and the exploitation of various resources. He announced that to concentrate financial resources, in the next few years, the state will continue to focus on the middle reaches of the Yellow River and the eight regions designated in 1982, while shifting the focus of soil and water conservation work to the four newly designated treatment regions. He hopes that local governments at all levels will also designate their own key treatment regions and ensure that treatment work is carried out layer by layer.

　　金沙江及毕节等四片地区列入水土保持重点治理区
    据新华社北京１月５日电  （记者张建军）经国务院批准，我国又将长江上游金沙江及毕节地区、嘉陵江中下游、陇南地区、三峡地区等４片列入水土保持重点治理区。这是全国水资源与水土保持工作领导小组副组长、水利部长杨振怀今天在这个领导小组的第一次会议上宣布的。
    １９８２年国务院曾批准将黄河流域的无定河、三川河、皇甫川、定西县，辽河流域的柳河上游，海河流域的永定河上游，长江流域的葛洲坝库区和江西兴国县等８片４３个县（旗）列为水土保持重点区。杨振怀在今天的会上指出，经过几年治理，这８片现已完成治理面积１．５万平方公里；建国以来到１９８７年，全国初步治理水土流失面积已达４９．５万平方公里。
    杨振怀指出，当前的突出问题是，一方面治理，一方面由于开垦陡坡、滥砍乱伐林木、破坏草原，特别是随着交通、工矿建设的发展和各项资源的开发，不断造成新的水土流失。他宣布，为集中财力，今后几年内，国家除继续抓好黄河中游地区和１９８２年确定的８片治理区外，将把水土保持工作的重点放在新近确定的这４片治理区上。他希望地方各级政府也应确定自己的重点治理区，层层抓好治理工作。
