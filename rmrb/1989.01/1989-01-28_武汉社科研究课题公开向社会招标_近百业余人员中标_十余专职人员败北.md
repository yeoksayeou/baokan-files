	Wuhan Social Science Research Topics Openly Tendered to Society
	Nearly 100 Amateurs Win Bids, More Than 10 Full-Time Researchers Fail

	Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, January 27th (Reporter Mei Jun) In the bidding process for research topics at the Wuhan Municipal Social Science Academy, more than 10 full-time researchers were eliminated, while nearly 100 amateur researchers from society secured the bids. This is a new phenomenon that has emerged in the social science community in the Wuhan area at the start of the new year.

	Last December, the Wuhan Municipal Social Science Academy publicly tendered 53 strategic applied research topics assigned by the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government to society. The news sparked a strong response from various sectors of society. Within ten days after the public announcement of the bids in the newspapers, 931 people submitted 221 bid proposals. Among them were university teachers, research personnel from scientific research institutions, party and government leaders, grassroots practitioners, as well as many factory workers and shop clerks. After evaluation by 6 experts from the academy and 3 responsible persons from the research departments of the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government, 67 proposals with strong applicability, reasonable arguments, and feasibility were successful in the bidding.

	Graduate Wu Jingtiao, the director of the Science and Technology Department of the Wuhan Municipal Social Science Academy, told the reporter that the topic bidding introduced a competitive mechanism into the field of social science research, breaking away from the long-standing practice of using research funds in an average and non-efficient manner. It has changed the previous situation where applied research lacked direction and research lacked vitality. This time, the academy allocated 50,000 yuan out of the 70,000 yuan research funds for the year 1989 to support the bidding topics, implementing equal competition between internal and external researchers. It was also stipulated that if the full-time researchers of the academy could not win in the competition and could not complete the mandatory research projects of the academy, they would be dismissed.

	The topic bidding has changed the traditional closed and subjective method of determining the topic bearers, focusing on the bid rather than the person. It is reported that the academy submitted 21 bids, with 10 successful. Some bid proposers from society with backgrounds were also eliminated because their bids lacked characteristics and quality.

	The social science community in the Wuhan area generally supports the topic bidding. One successful bidder said, although the maximum subsidy obtained is only 1,000 yuan, its significance is great because the topic and funds are obtained through competition. A section chief who has worked in a government agency for many years said that he has accumulated a lot of relevant materials on hand, which could only be handled according to the leader's intentions in the past. Now, he can, as an amateur researcher, open his mind and propose his own suggestions and views according to scientific laws.

### 武汉社科研究课题公开向社会招标  近百业余人员中标　十余专职人员败北

　　武汉社科研究课题公开向社会招标   
    近百业余人员中标　十余专职人员败北
    新华社武汉１月２７日电（记者梅君）武汉市社会科学院１０余名专职科研人员在本院的课题招标中败北，而社会上近百名业余科研人员却在竞争中获得了市社科院的课题资助。这是新年伊始在武汉地区社会科学界出现的一件新鲜事。
    去年底，武汉市社科院将武汉市委、市政府下达的５３个对策应用研究课题，面向社会，公开招标。消息传出后社会各界反响强烈。在报纸公开发标后的十多天里，有９３１人赶写出标书２２１份。他们中有大专院校的教师，科研部门的研究人员，党政领导干部，基层实际工作者，还有不少工厂职工和商店营业员，经过院内６名专家和武汉市委、市政府调研部门３名负责人的评定，６７份应用性强且又论证合理、具有可行性的标书中标。
    武汉市社科院科研处处长毕静涛向记者介绍说，课题招标将竞争机制引入社会科学研究领域，打破了长期以来平均和不讲效益使用科研经费的做法，改变了过去应用研究针对性不强、科研缺乏活力的状况。社科院这次将１９８９年度７万元科研经费拿出５万元资助招标课题，实行院内院外平等竞争，并规定本院专职科研人员，如不能在竞争中获胜，又不能完成院里的指令性科研项目，便要解聘。
    课题招标，一改过去传统封闭式的、主观圈定课题承担人的做法，认标不认人。据介绍，市社科院投标２１个，中标数为１０个。社会上一些有来头的投标者，也因为标书没有特色、质量不高而遭淘汰。
    武汉地区社科界人士普遍对课题招标表示拥护。一位中标者说，虽然获得的资助最多不过１０００元，但其意义是重大的，因为课题和经费是从竞争中得到的。一位在政府机关工作多年的处长则说，他手头上积累的有关材料很多，过去只能按照领导的意图办，现在则可以以一个业余科研工作者的身份，放开思想，按科学规律提出自己的建议和看法。
