Dear Editor,

Regarding whether a fetus has inheritance rights, we have had a dispute here. The situation is as follows: Zhao Liying, female, 65 years old; Chen Yuancai, female, 26 years old. Zhao and Chen are mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. Zhao's son died from an illness, leaving behind savings of 2,000 yuan. Zhao Liying proposed that she and Chen Yuancai each take 1,000 yuan. Chen Yuancai proposed that she is about to give birth and will need more money to raise the child, so she should get more. Zhao Liying disagrees, believing that the fetus has not been born yet and its fate is unknown, so it cannot have inheritance rights. How should this case be handled? Under what circumstances does an unborn fetus have inheritance rights?

Yours sincerely,
Zheng You

Dear Zheng You,

In law, a citizen's legal personality begins from the moment of birth. A "posthumous child," that is, a child born after the death of the parent, does not yet have the legal personality of a citizen and therefore cannot enjoy the civil rights granted by law (the qualification to participate in civil activities and enjoy civil rights and bear civil obligations). In this sense, a fetus does not have inheritance rights.

However, the various specific provisions of our country's inheritance laws should all follow the principle of supporting the elderly and raising children, which is the fundamental purpose of our country's inheritance laws. For this reason, Article 28 of the Inheritance Law of the People's Republic of China stipulates: "When dividing the estate, a share should be reserved for the fetus. If the fetus is stillborn, the reserved share shall be distributed according to the law of intestate succession." That is, when the deceased leaves behind a fetus that has not yet been born at the time of death and the inheritance begins, the heirs should reserve a share of the estate for this fetus when dividing the deceased's estate. The amount of the reserved estate should generally be equal to the amount of the estate inherited by the deceased's children who have already been born. If the heirs know that the deceased has left a fetus but do not reserve a share of the estate for the fetus when dividing the estate, or the amount reserved is very small, this is illegal.

Reserving an estate for a fetus does not mean that the fetus immediately inherits this estate; only when the fetus is born alive as a baby can it obtain the right to inherit this estate. This has nothing to do with how long the baby lives after birth. Even if the baby only lives for a short time after birth, it still obtains the right to inherit the estate reserved for it. In normal circumstances, this estate is managed and the relevant rights are exercised by the baby's mother as the legal guardian. If the fetus is stillborn (i.e., a "stillbirth"), then the estate reserved for the fetus should be inherited by the father's legal heirs according to the order of intestate succession. From this, it can be seen that Chen Yuancai has the right to demand that a share of the estate be reserved for her fetus.

### 胎儿有没有继承权

　　胎儿有没有继承权
    编辑同志：
    关于胎儿是否有继承权，我们这里发生了争执。情况是这样的：赵丽英，女，６５岁；陈元彩，女，２６岁。赵与陈系婆媳关系。赵儿子因病死亡，留下储蓄存款２０００元，赵丽英提出与陈元彩各分１０００元。陈元彩提出自己将要分娩和以后抚育孩子要多花钱，要求多分一些。赵丽英不同意，认为胎儿未出生，不知死活，不能享有继承权。该案应如何处理，未出生的胎儿在什么情况下才享有继承权？
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
　　郑友郑友同志：
    公民在法律上的人格，是从出生的时候才开始享有的。“遗腹子”，即在被继承人死亡时其配偶已经怀孕，但尚未出生的子女，还不具有公民的法律人格，因而还不能享有法律赋予公民的民事权利（即参加民事活动并享受民事权利和承担民事义务的资格）。从这个意义上讲，胎儿是不享有继承权的。
    但是，我国继承法律制度的各项具体规定，都应贯彻养老育幼的原则，这也是我国继承法律制度的根本目的所在。为此，我国《继承法》第２８条规定：“遗产分割时，应当保留胎儿的继承份额。胎儿出生时是死体的，保留的份额依照法定继承办。”即当被继承人死亡、继承开始的时候，如果被继承人遗留有尚未出生的胎儿，那么各继承人在分配被继承人的遗产时，就应当为这个胎儿保留一份遗产。保留的遗产数额，一般应与被继承人已出生的子女所继承的遗产数额相等。如果各继承人明知被继承人留有胎儿，却在分配遗产时不为胎儿保留一份遗产，或者保留的遗产数额很小，这种做法是违法的。
    为胎儿保留遗产，并不意味着该胎儿立即继承了这份遗产；只有等到胎儿活着出生成为婴儿的时候，他才能取得这份遗产的继承权。这与他出生后活的时间长短没有关系。哪怕他出生后只活了很短的时间，他也取得了为他保留的这份遗产的继承权。在通常情况下，这份遗产由他（她）母亲以法定代理人的身份代为保管和行使有关权利。如果胎儿出生时已经死亡（即所谓的“死胎”），那么为胎儿保留的那份遗产就应当由他父亲的法定继承人按照法定继承顺序继承。由此可知，陈元彩有权要求为自己的胎儿保留一份遗产。
