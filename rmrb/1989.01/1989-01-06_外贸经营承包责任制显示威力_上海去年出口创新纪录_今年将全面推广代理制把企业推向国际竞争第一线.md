The foreign trade management contract responsibility system has shown its strength in Shanghai. In 1988, Shanghai's exports set a new historical record, fully completing all contracted targets, with export earnings growing by 10% compared to 1987. On this basis, Shanghai will fully promote the agency export system this year, pushing enterprises to the forefront of international competition and advancing enterprise contracting and reform to a new historical stage.

Last year, while implementing fiscal contracting, Shanghai, in accordance with the State Council's decision, fully implemented the foreign trade management contract responsibility system. They adopted the "dual contracting" method, assigning contracting tasks to both foreign trade units and production units. Both parties signed production and sales contracts, strengthened coordination between industry and trade, and jointly overcame difficulties. Due to price increases, the cost of export goods rose, and the average purchase price for foreign trade last year increased by 20%, facing unprecedented difficulties. However, under the impetus of "dual contracting," enterprises worked hard to tap potential, foreign trade companies strove to sell at good prices, and both sides actively absorbed the factors of rising costs, ultimately achieving success and fully demonstrating the strong vitality of the foreign trade contracting system.

Based on last year's experience, Shanghai municipal leaders believe that Shanghai enterprises still have great potential for earning foreign exchange, and the key is to deepen enterprise reform and further improve the contract responsibility system. After three months of thorough preparation, the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government made a major decision to fully promote the agency export system across the city this year. The purpose of this is to push enterprises to the forefront of international competition, to temper themselves in taking risks, to accelerate the development of enterprises towards an outward-looking direction, to adjust the industrial structure, and to further strengthen the cooperation between industry and trade on a new basis.

This important decision has been unanimously supported by the foreign trade, production, and financial sectors, with all parties working together to accelerate the transition from the procurement system to the agency system. Based on current conditions, Shanghai will implement dual-line contracting for industry and trade. On one hand, enterprises will have export autonomy, but the foreign exchange earning targets will be jointly completed by enterprises and foreign trade units, with foreign trade units implementing full-process agency to strengthen the sense of responsibility of foreign trade units, unify export steps, and further improve and develop according to the situation. The textile industry in Shanghai has formulated an initial plan and will take the lead. This plan is also applicable to other industries. The medical and chemical industries are also actively preparing. The Municipal Government calls on all enterprises in the city to take action, establish a sense of the overall situation, overcome difficulties, and accelerate the implementation of the agency system.

　　外贸经营承包责任制显示威力
    上海去年出口创新纪录
    今年将全面推广代理制把企业推向国际竞争第一线
    本报上海１月５日电  记者章世鸿报道：外贸经营承包责任制在上海首战告捷。１９８８年上海出口创汇创历史新纪录，全面完成各项承包指标，出口创汇额比１９８７年增长１０％。在这个基础上，上海今年将在全市全面推广代理出口制，把企业承包和企业改革推向新的历史阶段。
    去年上海在实行财政包干的同时，根据国务院的决定，全面实行外贸经营承包责任制。他们采取“双承包”办法，即把承包任务同时落实到外贸单位和生产单位，工贸双方签订产销合同，加强工贸协调，共同战胜困难。由于物价上涨，出口商品成本上升，去年外贸收购价平均提高２０％，面临前所未有的困难。但在“双承包”推动下，企业努力挖潜力，外贸公司力争出口卖好价格，双方积极消化成本上升因素，终于取得了成就，充分体现了外贸承包制的强大生命力。
    根据去年的经验，上海市府领导认为，上海企业创汇还有很大的潜力，关键是要深化企业改革，进一步完善承包责任制。为此，经过三个月的充分酝酿，市委和市府作出重大的决策，决定今年在全市全面推广代理出口制。这样做，目的是把企业推向国际竞争第一线，在承担风险中锻炼自己，加快企业向外向型发展，调整产业结构，同时将进一步加强工贸间在新的基础上的联合。
    这项重要决策受到外贸部门、生产部门、金融部门一致的拥护，各方共同配合加快由收购制向代理制转变。根据现有条件，上海将实行工贸双线承包，一方面企业拥有出口自主权，但创汇指标由企业和外贸单位共同来完成，由外贸单位实行全过程代理，以加重外贸单位的责任心，统一出口步调，以后再根据形势发展不断完善和发展。上海纺织行业已制定初步方案，先走一步，这个方案也适用其他行业。医疗、化工行业也正在积极作准备工作。上海市府号召全市企业行动起来，树立全局观点，克服畏难情绪，加快代理制的实现。
