For protecting the safety of trains and passengers, five young people from the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau have been posthumously recognized as martyrs. The People's Government of Henan Province has posthumously recognized them as revolutionary martyrs, and the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has posthumously recognized Guo Huifu as a member of the Communist Party. Yesterday morning, the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau held a grand meeting to commend their heroic deeds and called on the more than 80,000 employees of the entire bureau to learn from them.

On July 18, 1987, Guo Huifu, the deputy conductor of the third crew of the Chongqing team of the Zhengzhou Passenger Transport Section, and Yang Ming, the secretary of the youth league branch and a train attendant, were on duty for the 287th express train from Zhengzhou to Chongqing. When the criminal Dong Xueliang (who has been executed) caused an explosion on the train, Guo Huifu and Yang Ming, in order to protect the safety of the train and passengers, bravely rushed to the explosion point to defuse the explosive, and sacrificed their lives heroically.

Comrade He Jiajing was a train attendant of the second crew of the Changsha team of the Zhengzhou Passenger Transport Section. On January 18, 1988, when the 257th train she was on duty for was between He Sheng Bridge and Heng Gou Bridge in Hubei Province, a violent crime occurred where a knife-wielding criminal killed a person. In this critical moment, acting train conductor Ba Jianjun, train attendants He Jiajing, Wang Yurong, and others fearlessly fought to the death with the criminal. He Jiajing was stabbed in the left chest by the criminal while trying to seize the weapon and sacrificed her life gloriously.

On December 22, 1987, more than ten workers of the Huanghe Bridge Section were working on the Huanghe Railway Bridge. An old worker accidentally fell into the rapid current of the Yellow River. Young workers Su Qingxi and Wei Huapeng, who were working on the bridge, jumped into the icy river without hesitation, and with the help of other comrades, rescued the old worker. However, Su Qingxi and Wei Huapeng were swept away by the surging waters of the Yellow River.
