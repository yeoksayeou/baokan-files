Police Officer Jiang Xuegang Bravely Fights Off Criminals,
Saving a Specialist Household's 100,000 Yuan in Cash from Robbery

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, January 25th - Police Officer Jiang Xuegang of the Public Transportation Division of Anshan City Public Security Bureau in Liaoning Province bravely fought off criminals, saving a specialist household's 100,000 yuan in cash from robbery. Recently, the Anshan City Public Security Bureau held a meeting to commend him.

On the afternoon of December 28th last year, while Jiang Xuegang was on a bus, four criminals openly robbed a specialist household from another province of a travel bag containing 100,000 yuan in cash. Just as the criminals were about to escape through the bus door, Jiang Xuegang, who was in plainclothes, shouted, "Put the bag down! I'm from the Public Security Bureau!" He then rushed forward and fought with the criminals, grabbing one of the taller criminals. With the help of bus company workers Zong Guohui and Xu Yao, the tall criminal was caught on the spot. The other criminals dropped the travel bag and fled. Ten days later, the shorter criminal was also apprehended. The other two criminals are still being pursued.

It is reported that in less than two months of being responsible for public security on buses at the Public Transportation Division's Vehicle Police Station, Jiang Xuegang has already caught over 30 criminals who committed crimes on public buses.

　　民警姜学刚勇斗歹徒
    专业户十万元现金免遭抢劫
    新华社沈阳１月２５日电  辽宁省鞍山市公安局公共交通分局民警姜学刚，勇斗歹徒，使一名外地专业户的１０万元现金免遭抢劫。最近，鞍山市公安局召开大会予以表彰。
    去年１２月２８日下午，在姜学刚乘坐的３路公共客车上，有４名歹徒在众目睽睽之下抢劫一外地专业户装有１０万元巨款的旅行包。就在歹徒得手冲出车门时，身着便装的姜学刚大喝一声：“把东西放下，我是公安局的！”说着冲上前去与歹徒搏斗，一把抓住了跑在后面的一个大个子歹徒。在公交公司工人钟国辉、徐瑶的协助下，大个子歹徒被当场抓获。其他歹徒丢下旅行包拚命逃窜，１０天后，矮个子歹徒也落入法网。其他两名罪犯正在追捕中。
    据介绍，姜学刚在担负公交分局汽车派出所车上治安任务的不足两个月的时间里，已先后抓获在公共汽车上作案的犯罪分子３０余名。
