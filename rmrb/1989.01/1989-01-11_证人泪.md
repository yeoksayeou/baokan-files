Tears of a Witness

A reporter from this newspaper, Zheng Degang, recently investigated the case of Payoulien from Lingyuan County, Liaoning Province, who came to the newspaper to complain. Payoulien reported that her father, Payou Tian, suffered physical and mental harm in 1984 while acting as a witness for a joint investigation team from the Chaoyang Municipal Committee and the Lingyuan County Committee. For many years, Payoulien has been appealing for her father, but the issue has not been resolved. Recently, the reporter conducted an investigation into the problems raised by Payoulien.

An Unusual Investigation Team

The incident began in November 1984. At that time, the investigation team arrived in Goumenzi Township, Lingyuan County, to investigate issues related to a deputy secretary of the Lingyuan County Committee. Since this deputy secretary had lived and worked in Goumenzi Township, before leaving, the deputy leader of the investigation team, Sun Shiming, the secretary of the Lingyuan County Discipline Inspection Commission, borrowed a handgun and 10 bullets from the county public security bureau to carry with him, supposedly to prevent any "unforeseen events." Upon arriving in Goumenzi, Sun Shiming demanded that the Goumenzi Township Guesthouse hand over the keys to the rooms where the investigation team members were staying, and that all rooms should have bolts. Rooms without window latches were to have them installed. It was said that this was to prevent leaks and ensure safety.

The Family of Payou Tian

The investigation team's methods were particularly "unique" and intimidating to the witnesses.

On December 12, 1984, a cadre from Taogou Village in Goumenzi Township summoned Payou Tian to the village office. Soon after, a car took him away. For five or six days, Payou Tian's family had no idea where he had gone. Payou Tian's wife was so anxious that she couldn't eat, drink, or sleep, and insisted on finding the village cadres to demand his return. It was not until the evening of December 18 that Payou Tian, with a face full of tears, stumbled back into his courtyard. That night, Payou Tian lay on the kang, crying uncontrollably at times and muttering to himself at others.

It turned out that after being taken away by Sun Shiming and others from the investigation team, Payou Tian was driven to a place about 20 kilometers away from Goumenzi Township in Siheshang Township. The investigation team members asked Payou Tian to provide testimony. Payou Tian, unable to recall events from over a decade ago, was reluctant to testify. Sun Shiming said, "If you don't honestly confess, I will report you to the entire county, and I have the authority to punish you." Another member of the investigation team said, "Do you want your party membership? I'll revoke it, and it will affect your children!" Payou Tian felt very troubled. On the morning of December 15, around 4 am, he sneaked out of the house and wandered around a few wells for over two hours, contemplating suicide; but he thought that dying this way would be unclear, so he did not take his own life. That night, Sun Shiming came to Payou Tian's room, suddenly pulled out a handgun and showed it to Payou Tian, then locked the door from the outside and fired a shot. After days of threats and intimidation, Payou Tian finally provided testimony. Later, he told others that the testimony he provided was false and fabricated.

After returning home, Payou Tian often cried, acted strangely, and tried to run away. At night, he sometimes suddenly got up and urinated out the window. The hospital's diagnosis for Payou Tian was: "Reactive mental disorder? Neurosis," "Psychogenic reaction?"

Shortly after the New Year in 1985, Payoulien, then only 24 years old, began seeking treatment and justice for her ailing father. The entire family paid a heavy price for this. Payoulien's two younger siblings dropped out of school; one went to Shenyang to work as a laborer, and the other went to Heilongjiang to carry bricks. To raise funds for their appeals, Payoulien cut back on expenses, losing over 10 kilograms. Payoulien told the reporter: The deputy secretary of the Chaoyang Municipal Discipline Inspection Commission and the head of the joint investigation team, Wang Xuemin, had once said to her, "We are very sorry for the unpleasant experience caused to Comrade Payou Tian in his mind." A simple "sorry" was the only compensation for Payou Tian and his family.

Everyone Has Their Sorrows

During the investigation, the reporter learned that other witnesses had similar experiences to Payou Tian.

In Beigou Village, there was a woman in her thirties named Lü Haijing. When the reporter interviewed her, she had a vacant stare, unkempt hair, and dirty face. During the conversation, she would sometimes shout, sometimes mutter to herself, and occasionally pick up corn kernels from the ground to chew.

According to Lü Haijing's husband, Wang Guimin, and others, on the evening of April 24, 1985, several members of the investigation team drove to find Wang Guimin and others to gather information. Wang Guimin argued a few times, and Cai Junqian, a member of the investigation team and a discipline inspection official from Lingyuan County, grabbed Wang Guimin's collar and said, "You're not being honest, come with us!" At this point, Lü Haijing entered from the outer room and asked, "Why are you taking him away?" Cai Junqian then argued with Lü Haijing. Lü Haijing's sleeve was torn, her left wrist was injured, and her entire arm was in so much pain that she couldn't move it. The next day, the Lingyuan County Hospital diagnosed Lü Haijing's condition as: "Contusion of the soft tissues of the left wrist." On the way to the hospital, Lü Haijing suddenly started crying, laughing, and singing. On April 26, Wang Guimin found the investigation team members and said, "Lü Haijing has gone mad." Later, the Lingyuan County Public Security Bureau sent Lü Haijing to the Chaoyang Region Mental Health Hospital for examination. The diagnosis was: Lü Haijing had "Psychogenic mental disorder."

In December 1985, the Goumenzi Township government, based on the opinions of relevant county departments, signed an agreement with Lü Haijing and Wang Guimin, stipulating: The county committee ordered the Civil Affairs Bureau to allocate 500 yuan for Lü Haijing's medical treatment and living expenses, with no additional funds in the future; Lü Haijing promised not to appeal again for this matter, and if she did, she would be personally responsible; the county and township governments would not be responsible for the living difficulties and economic losses caused by Lü Haijing's appeals, and would not be responsible for any future development of her condition. Although Lü Haijing and her husband signed this agreement, they were not satisfied and continued to appeal. However, the head of the investigation team, Li Jingyi from the Chaoyang Municipal Discipline Inspection Commission, and Sun Shiming and Wang Xuemin stated in a report that Lü Haijing's illness was feigned, and this was a "struggle between investigation and counter-investigation," a "planned counterattack" against the investigation work.

Farmer Yao Xiulin told the reporter: When the investigation team came to him for testimony, he couldn't remember or didn't know some things, so the investigation team members spoke rudely to him. They used phrases like "your mother," "old bull," "playing dead," and so on. Sun Shiming even kicked his buttocks. During meals, the investigation team members ate and drank heartily, but only gave him cold rice and tofu with ice shards. Yao Xiulin had no choice but to reluctantly provide testimony. Later, he sometimes ran up the mountain when he heard the sound of a car.

Woman Yao Guier told the reporter: The investigation team came to her for testimony, and she told the truth and stamped her fingerprint. Later, she found that the record did not match what she had said. On December 29, 1984, the investigation team took her to the township in a car for testimony. She cried because she didn't know some things. Sun Shiming said, "Don't act like a village shrew!" After the testimony, it was already dark, and the relevant personnel sent her to the village entrance about a kilometer from her home and left. Yao Guier, shivering with cold and fear, walked home in the dark through knee-deep snow, freezing and scared, and didn't even know she had passed her front door. At around 9:30 pm, her husband found her about a kilometer from home.

Goumenzi Township cadre Lü Qing said: The investigation team came to him for testimony, and he truthfully stated some situations. The relevant personnel from the investigation team scolded him and made him copy the party constitution.

Goumenzi Township driver Jin Wanchun said: The investigation team asked him to provide testimony, but he had nothing to say. The county discipline inspection commission issued a notice criticizing Jin Wanchun for "not actively participating in the work and struggle to purify the party organization" and suggested that the township party committee order him to stop work and reflect, and check and report on the issues.

Additionally, some other people who had been contacted by the investigation team also encountered similar situations. When they recounted their experiences to the reporter, some had tears in their eyes, and others shook their heads in sighs...

Unanswered Questions

In February 1985, a reporter from the Liaoning Daily wrote an internal report titled "A Lawless and Disorderly Discipline Inspection Investigation Team." Soon after, relevant departments in Chaoyang formed a second investigation team. Surprisingly, the head of this team was still Wang Xuemin, and one of the members was also transferred from the original joint investigation team. Before the second investigation team began work, they were informed that during the investigation, they were not allowed to tell the investigation subjects that this was another investigation team. The report written by the second investigation team was also revised by Li Jingyi and Wang Xuemin, the heads of the Chaoyang Municipal Committee and the Lingyuan County Committee joint investigation team, and submitted to the provincial discipline inspection commission in the name of the Chaoyang Municipal Discipline Inspection Commission. It only acknowledged that Sun Shiming had "problems" in his "work methods."

Some leaders also stated that the Liaoning Daily issued an "internal report," and who did they consult? If the reporter's party membership is in Chaoyang, they should be criticized at the branch meeting; they helped bad people, cheered them on, criticized them at the meeting, made them reflect, and punished them for a few issues!

To this day, these witnesses are still appealing. Some accuse the investigation team of illegal detention, while others accuse them of coercing confessions. Many people do not understand: To investigate the issue of a county committee deputy secretary, why did they have to make an entire township full of complaints? Why do so many witnesses cry when they talk about this matter? Is it just because of the "work methods" of a few individuals in the investigation team?

专栏：信访调查

　　证人泪
    本报记者  郑德刚
    前些时候，辽宁朝阳市凌源县沟门子乡付贵莲来本报上访，反映她父亲付有田１９８４年在当证人时，由于朝阳市委和凌源县委联合调查组个别成员的违法乱纪，致使他身心受到损伤，精神受到刺激。多年来，付贵莲为父亲到处申诉，但问题始终得不到解决。前不久，记者就付贵莲反映的问题进行了调查。
    　　　　不同凡响的调查组
    事情起因于１９８４年１１月。当时，调查组来到凌源县沟门子乡，调查凌源县委一位副书记的有关问题。由于这位副书记曾在沟门子乡生活、工作过，临行前，调查组副组长、凌源县纪委书记孙世明让人从县公安局借了一支手枪和１０发子弹，随身携带，以防“不测”。调查组一到沟门子，孙世明就要求沟门子乡招待所把调查组的人住的房间的钥匙交出来，门要有闩棍，没有窗钩的要安上窗钩。据说，这是为了防止泄密，保证安全。
    　　　　付有田一家
    调查组的工作方法是十分“特殊”而令证人生畏的。
    １９８４年１２月１２日下午，沟门子乡塔沟村的一位干部把付有田叫到村部，接着一辆小汽车将他拉走了。一晃五六天，家里人不知道付有田的去向。付有田的老伴为此急得不吃、不喝，也不睡，硬要找村干部要人。直到１２月１８日晚，付有田满脸泪水，跌跌撞撞地摸进自家的院门。当天晚上，付有田躺在炕上，一会儿痛哭不止，一会儿喃喃自语。
    原来，付有田被调查组的孙世明等人接走后，被车拉到距沟门子乡一二十公里的四合当乡。调查组的人让付有田出证。付有田因记不清１０多年前的事情而不愿出证，孙世明便说：“你不老实交待问题，我通报你全县，我有权处分你。”调查组的另一成员也说：“你要党票不？到时把党票给你拿下来，对你的子女都有影响！”付有田感到十分为难，１２月１５日清晨４点多，他偷偷地从屋里出来，在几眼井前徘徊了两个多小时，想一死了之；但又觉得这样死，不清不白，才没有寻短见。当天晚上，孙世明来到付有田住的房间，突然掏出一支手枪向付有田炫耀了一番，然后出门把房门反锁上，接着又在外面放了一枪。几天的威逼恫吓，付有田终于出了证。事后他对人说，他出的证有的是假的，是编的。
    付有田回家后，常常又哭又闹又要跑。晚上睡觉，有时突然起来对着窗子撒尿。医院给付有田开的诊断书上写着：“反映性精神障碍？神经官能症”、“心因性反映？”
    １９８５年元旦一过，年仅２４岁的付贵莲带着生病的父亲开始治病和告状，全家为此付出了沉重的代价。付贵莲两个年幼的弟弟妹妹放下书包，一个跑到沈阳当小工，一个跑到黑龙江给人家搬砖头。为了凑上访费用，付贵莲省吃俭用，体重骤减１０多公斤。付贵莲告诉记者：朝阳市纪委副书记、联合调查组总负责人王学敏曾向她表示：“给有田同志在精神上造成的不愉快，很是对不起。”一句“对不起”，便是对付有田及其一家的全部报偿。
    　　　　各有伤心事
    记者在调查中进一步了解到，其他证人也有同付有田相似的情况。
    北沟村有个３０多岁的妇女叫吕海英。记者采访时，只见她目光呆滞、蓬头垢面，交谈中，一会儿高声叫骂，一会儿又自言自语，还不时捡起地上的玉米粒放进嘴里咀嚼着。
    据吕海英的丈夫王桂民等人介绍，１９８５年４月２４日晚，调查组的几个人驱车找王桂民等人了解情况。王桂民分辩了几句，调查组成员、凌源县纪委干部蔡俊泉便一把揪住王桂民的衣领说：“你不老实，带走！”这时，吕海英从外屋进来说：“你们为何要把人带走？”蔡俊泉便与吕海英发生了纠葛。吕海英衣袖被撕破，左手腕受伤，整条手臂也疼得动不了。第二天，凌源县医院对吕海英的病情作了诊断：左手腕软组织挫伤。在看病的路上，吕海英突然又哭又笑又唱。４月２６日，王桂民找到调查组的人说：“吕海英疯了。”后来，凌源县公安局将吕海英送到朝阳地区精神病防治院检查，经诊断：吕海英得了“心因性精神障碍”。
    １９８５年１２月，沟门子乡政府根据县有关部门的意见，与吕海英、王桂民签定了一份协议书，规定：县委指令民政局拨款５００元给吕海英治病及生活补助，以后不予增拨；吕海英保证不再因此事上访，如再上访由个人负责；对吕海英上访所造成的生活困难和经济损失，县乡两级从即日起不予承担，今后本人病情发展如何，不承担任何责任。吕海英夫妇虽然在这份协议书上签了字，但他们并不服，他们继续在告状。然而，调查组组长、朝阳市纪委干部李景义以及孙世明、王学敏在一份上报的材料中认为，吕海英的病是装出来的，这是一场“核查与反核查的斗争”，是对核查工作“有计划的反扑”。
    农民姚秀林告诉记者：调查组的人找他取证时，有些事他实在记不清或者不知道，调查组的人就对他出言不逊。什么“你妈的”、“老犊子”、“装死狗”，等等。孙世明还用脚蹬他的屁股。吃饭时，调查组的人热热火火又吃又喝，却只给他吃凉饭和带冰碴的豆腐。姚秀林无奈只好违心地出了证。事后，他有时一听见汽车声，就吓得往山上跑。
    妇女姚桂娥对记者说：调查组找她取证，她如实说了，还按了手印。后来，她发现记录和她说的不一样。１９８４年１２月２９日，调查组又用车把她接到乡里取证，她因有些事情不知道而急得哭了起来。孙世明说：“你不要像农村的泼妇那样！”取证完后天已黑了，有关人员用车把她送到距家约一公里的村口就走了。姚桂娥冒着严寒，踏着尺把深的大雪摸黑往家走，连冻带吓，走过家门也不知道。晚上９点多钟，她的丈夫才从离家约一公里的地方找到她。
    沟门子乡干部吕清说：调查组的人找他取证，他如实说了一些情况，调查组有关人员就训斥他，还让他默写党章。
    沟门子乡汽车司机金万春说：调查组让他出证，他没有什么可谈的。县纪委就在全县发通报，批评金万春“不积极参加纯洁党组织的工作和斗争”，并建议乡党委令其停职反省，检查交待问题。
    另外，还有一些被调查组找过的人也遇到类似的情况。他们在向记者讲述时，有的目中含泪，有的摇头叹息……
    　　　　不理解之处
    １９８５年２月，辽宁日报一位记者采写了一篇题为《一个违法乱纪的纪检调查组》的内参。不久，朝阳市有关部门组成第二个调查组。令人不解的是，这个调查组的负责人还是王学敏，有个成员也是从原联合调查组调来的。第二个调查组开始工作前被告知：调查时不许向调查对象说这是另一个调查组。第二个调查组写的调查报告，还经朝阳市委和凌源县委联合调查组组长李景义和王学敏修改后，以朝阳市纪委的名义上报省纪委，仅仅承认孙世明在“工作方法”上有“毛病”。
    有的领导人还表态说，辽宁日报发“内参”，跟谁打了招呼？记者的党组织关系如果在朝阳，要让他在支部会上检讨；他帮助坏人，摇旗呐喊，开会批评他，让他作检查，抓几个问题处分他！
    时至今日，这些证人仍在上访，他们有的控告调查组搞非法拘禁，有的控告调查组搞逼供信。许多人不理解：为了调查一个县委副书记的问题，为什么要把一个乡搞得怨声四起？为什么不少证人一谈起此事来总是泪流满面？难道说仅仅是调查组个别人的“工作方法”问题吗？
