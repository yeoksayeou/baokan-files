On the shores of Laizhou Bay in Shandong Province, a grand south-north oriented seawall stands, separating the vast sea from the tidal flats. Year after year, the waves crash against the green stone-paved embankment, rolling up layers of foam, as if telling the story of this place's past and present...

	(One)

The 120,000 mu of tidal flats along Laizhou Bay were once a desolate stretch of sand, with roaring tides constantly encroaching on coastal villages and farmlands.

"Build a dam, tame the dragon, and turn the barren flats into grain fields!" Starting in the spring of 1976, under the slogan of "Grain as the Key Link," over 80,000 farmers built a 5-meter-high, 8-meter-wide, and 83-li-long seawall on the barren flats.

We do not intend to comment on the merits and demerits of the dam's construction. As history, in that era, people's thoughts were tightly confined within the framework of "Grain as the Key Link." They had the ability to build the dam but could not correctly recognize its value or find a reasonable way to utilize it. "Reclaim land from the sea, turn barren flats into grain fields!"

Farmers sowed crops in the "Dazhai Fields," but when there was no rain, they carried water from five or six kilometers away to irrigate the sorghum and sweet potatoes. After more than ten days, the sorghum had not sprouted, and the few surviving potato seedlings were thin and yellow, like they had anemia. Crops failed, so they switched to sunflowers and hemp. The seedlings finally grew, but without irrigation, they wilted. In the end, a year's work was for naught.

The dream of "turning barren flats into grain fields" was shattered! The tidal flats beneath the dam returned to their former desolation: white and vast in spring, damp and muddy in autumn.

One day in the winter of 1984, two caves appeared on the western embankment of the deserted dam. Not far from the caves, a few newly dug shrimp ponds shimmered blue. Someone was challenging the barren flats!

The leader was named Jiao Yandeng, a farmer from Haicang Village, Tushan Town, known as "Jiao the Bold." He had farmed, fished, and in 1983, bought a car for transportation, becoming the first millionaire in Laizhou through transportation. He heard that shrimp farming on saline-alkali flats was highly profitable and rallied 17 households to form a shrimp farming cooperative. With no money, they pooled resources, each contributing 500 yuan, sharing profits and risks. He sold two cars, investing all the money into building shrimp ponds. Winter turned to spring, and a 900-meter-long waterway extended from the Jiaolai River estuary to the shrimp pond dam. The 452 mu of shrimp ponds rippled with blue water. The dam protected the shrimp from tidal attacks, ensuring their safety. Shrimp farming was a surprising success in its first year, yielding over 41,000 kilograms of shrimp and a net profit of over 220,000 yuan. The next year, Jiao Yandeng expanded the cooperative to 32 households, investing all the previous year's earnings into expanding production. The shrimp yield increased by over 23,000 kilograms compared to the previous year, with a net profit of 760,000 yuan after deducting costs. Each member of the cooperative became a dual millionaire.

"The tidal flats have yielded gold, 'Jiao the Bold' has made a fortune from shrimp!" The news spread like wildfire across Laizhou Bay, and people began to recognize the value of the dam and the tidal flats.

Secretary Wang Xuegang of the municipal committee delivered a persuasive speech at a meeting of cadres at three levels: "Statistics show that the average profit rate of township enterprises in the city is around 17%, while shrimp farming reaches 30%, and the investment sees returns in the same year. Scientific verification shows that Laizhou Bay's tidal flats have great potential for shrimp farming. The thousand-year-old barren flats have awakened to serve the people!"

In the autumn of 1986, the construction of a ten-thousand-mu shrimp farm began on the shores of Laizhou Bay. The city unified the design and planning, built key projects, and implemented the principle of "who invests, who builds, who benefits" for the shrimp pond projects. Coastal, plain, and mountainous areas—all 28 townships in the city mobilized 100,000 people. The ten-thousand-mu shrimp ponds were completed and put into production in just half a year. In 1987, the city's total shrimp production reached 2,320 tons, generating a profit of 18.7 million yuan.

At the same time last year, municipal leaders organized farmers to build another 20,000-mu shrimp farm. "Great effort, good management, wishing you success!" Vice Premier Tian Jiyun personally wrote a letter of congratulations to the people of Laizhou.

Shrimp is delicious, and shrimp farming makes big money, but growing and harvesting shrimp is not smooth sailing. Like many other things, it has gone through twists and turns and difficulties. Initially, many people thought that as long as they built shrimp ponds and put in shrimp seedlings and feed, they could harvest shrimp and make money. Things were not that simple. In 1985 and 1986, the average yield of the 1,000 mu of shrimp fields in Tushan Town's shrimp farming base was only around 15 kilograms per mu, with sizes less than 8 centimeters. Over two years, they lost 230,000 yuan, and two-thirds of the workers took "sick leave."

Assistant Engineer Yang Xuesong realized that the primitive shrimp farming method was like gambling. He and his partners experimented, failed, and tried again. Last year, Yang Xuesong's shrimp farm achieved a high-yield record of 142.5 kilograms per mu. Among them, 3.2 mu of high-yield experimental fields had an average yield of 935.3 kilograms per mu; the yield per mu increased from 753 yuan to 1,460 yuan, with each person earning over 30,000 yuan. People began to change their mindset from "making money from shrimp farming" to requiring scientific and technological progress to improve efficiency and adapt to market changes.

Previously, when some shrimp farm workers heard that the city's aquaculture technicians were coming to sign shrimp farming technology contracts, they were reluctant, fearing they would share the profits. Now, they actively seek out contracts. Science and technology are productive forces. Last year, the average yield of the city's 30,000 mu of contiguous shrimp ponds reached 107.2 kilograms per mu. Among them, the shrimp ponds participating in the Ministry of Agriculture's "Bumper Harvest Plan" had a yield exceeding 180 kilograms per mu, setting a high-yield record for large-scale shrimp farming in Shandong Province.

The enhanced awareness of efficiency has broadened the horizons of Laizhou's farmers, making them see further. The commander of the tidal flat development, Vice Mayor Wang Yuting of Laizhou, also has an account in mind: if the yield per mu is increased by another 25 kilograms at the current level, it is equivalent to building a new ten-thousand-mu shrimp farm. If the shrimp body length is increased by another centimeter, the benefit is equivalent to the income of a ten-thousand-mu shrimp farm. Therefore, the municipal committee and government have established the guiding ideology of "transforming and tapping potential to improve levels, precision farming for high yield and efficiency." Surrounding the improvement of the comprehensive benefits of marine aquaculture, the promotion of shrimp farming technology with sea cucumbers and shellfish is also included in the 1989 development plan.

　　海潮大坝的昨天和今天
    ——记莱州市开发沿海滩涂养殖
    潘士强　王百忠　邓兆安
    山东省莱州湾畔，一条气势宏伟南北走向的防潮大坝，将浩瀚的大海与滩涂截开。年复一年，海潮拍打着青石铺成的坝堤，卷起层层浪花，仿佛在向人们叙说着这里的昨天和今天……
    　　　　（一）
    莱州湾畔的１２万亩滩涂，曾是一片荒无人烟的沙滩，汹涌咆哮的海潮不断侵吞着沿岸的村庄和农田。
    “建大坝，锁蛟龙，誓把荒滩变粮田。”从１９７６年初春起，在“以粮为纲”的口号下，８万多名农民在荒滩上建起了一条高５米、顶宽８米、长８３华里的防潮大坝。
    我们无意评说大坝建设功过，作为历史，在那个年代，人们的思想被牢牢地束缚在“以粮为纲”的框子里，有能力建造大坝，却不能正确认识大坝的价值，找到合理利用的途径。“围海造田，荒滩变粮川！”
    农民在“大寨田”里播种，天旱无雨，便肩挑手推从五、六公里外运来淡水，点种上高粱，栽上地瓜。十多天过去了，高粱没发芽，活下来的少量瓜苗像患了“贫血症”，又瘦又黄。种粮不行，就改种向日葵、红麻。苗子总算长出来了，可不浇淡水就打蔫，到头来，一年赚了个白忙活。
    “荒滩变粮川”的梦彻底破灭了！大坝下的滩涂又恢复了昔日的荒凉景象：春天白茫茫，秋天潮漉漉。
    　　　　（二）
    １９８４年冬的一天，冷落的大坝西部堤岸下出现了两个窑洞，洞西不远处，几个新挖成的虾池蓝湛湛的。有人向荒滩挑战了！
    领头的人名叫焦延德，土山镇海仓三村农民，人称“焦大胆”。他种过地、打过鱼，１９８３年买汽车跑运输，成了莱州第一个靠运输发家的万元户。他听说盐碱滩上建池养虾收益高的信息，便串联１７户农民组成了养虾联合体。没有钱，大家集资，每股５００元，利益均沾，风险共担。他咬牙卖掉了两部汽车，钱全部投入虾池建设。冬去春来，大坝下一条长９００米的引水渠从胶莱河入海口延伸到虾池坝，４５２亩虾池碧波荡漾。大坝挡住海潮的袭击，保护虾安全。养虾当年就获得了意想不到的成功，对虾总产４．１万多公斤，得纯利２２万多元。第二年，焦延德将股份扩大到３２户，上一年的养虾积累全部投入扩大再生产，对虾总产比上年增加了２．３万多公斤，扣除成本纯赚７６万元，入股的农民个个成了双万元户。
    “滩涂吐出金子来了，‘焦大胆’发虾财啦！”这消息如一石惊天，传遍了莱州湾大地，人们重新认识大坝和滩涂的价值。
    市委书记王学刚在三级干部大会上发表了颇具说服力的演讲：“据统计，全市乡镇企业平均利润率在１７％左右，而养虾却高达３０％，而且，当年投资当年见效。经科学论证，莱州湾滩涂养殖对虾潜力很大。沉睡千年的荒滩到为人民献宝的时候了！”
    １９８６年秋，万亩虾场建设在莱州湾畔展开了。市里统一设计、规划，建骨干工程，虾池工程则实行“谁投资、谁建池、谁受益”原则，沿海的、平原的、山区的——全市２８个乡镇一下子就出动了１０万人，万亩虾池仅用半年的时间就建成投产了。１９８７年全市对虾总产达到２３２０吨，创利１８７０万元。
    就在上年的同一个时间，市领导组织农民再建起两万亩虾场。“干劲大、抓得好，祝你们成功！”国务院副总理田纪云向莱州人民亲笔贺勉。
    　　　　（三）
    对虾鲜美，养虾挣大钱，可养成、养好不是顺顺当当的，同许许多多事情一样，经过了曲折与艰难。开始，有不少人以为只要建起虾池，投进虾苗、饵料，就能起虾赚钱，事情远不那么简单。１９８５和１９８６两年，土山镇对虾养殖场１０００亩虾田平均亩产只在１５公斤上下，规格不足８厘米，两年赔进２３万元，场里２／３的职工开了“小差”。
    助理工程师杨学宋意识到原始的养虾方法是“碰大运”，必须靠科学技术提高效益，减少风险。他同伙伴们一起试验，失败，再试验。去年，杨学宋的虾场创出了平均亩产１４２．５公斤的高产纪录，其中３．２亩精养高产试验田，平均亩产达９３５．３公斤；亩效益由７５３元上升到１４６０元，人均创利３万多元。人们开始改变“养虾挣钱就行”的观念，要求靠科学技术提高效益，适应市场的变化。
    以前，不少虾场的人一听说市里的水产技术员要来搞养虾技术承包，总不乐意，唯恐他们分了自己的利，现在却主动找上门来签订承包合同。科学技术就是生产力。去年，全市３万亩连片虾池平均亩产达１０７．２公斤，其中，承担农业部“丰收计划”的虾池亩产突破１８０公斤，创造了山东省对虾养殖大面积高产纪录。
    效益观念的增强，使莱州农民的眼界更宽了，看得也更远了。滩涂开发总指挥、莱州市副市长王玉亭心里也装了一本帐：如果在现有水平上，亩产量再提高２５公斤，就相当于新建一个万亩虾场，如果对虾体长再增加一厘米，其效益又相当于一万亩虾场的收入。为此，市委、市政府确立了“改造挖潜上水平，精养高产求效益”的指导思想，围绕提高海水养殖的综合效益，对虾与海参、贝类混养技术的推广也列入了１９８９年的开发计划。
