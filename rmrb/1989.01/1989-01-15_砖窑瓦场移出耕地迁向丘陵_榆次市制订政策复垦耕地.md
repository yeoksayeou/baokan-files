	Brickyards and tile factories move out of farmland and relocate to hills
	Yuxian City formulates policies to reclaim farmland

	Xinhua News Agency reports: The so-called "land tigers" of Yuxian City, nearly a hundred brick and tile factories, have been consuming over 500 acres of farmland each year in recent years. In 1988, the Yuxian City government fully utilized policy regulation to initially control these "land tigers."

	In recent years, brick and tile production has become a pillar industry for Yuxian City's farmers to get rich. However, it has also brought about a very serious consequence. According to statistics from the beginning of last year, the entire city has built 148 large-scale mechanized brick kilns, occupying and destroying a total of 5,412 acres of land.

	Following the principles of not blocking farmers' paths to wealth, not affecting national construction, not destroying farmland, and saving as much farmland as possible, the Yuxian City government utilized policy regulation to encourage the relocation of brick and tile production to hilly and mountainous areas rich in clay.

	In the first half of last year, the city government forwarded regulations formulated by relevant departments. It clearly stated that from now on, no new brick and tile factories are allowed to be established on farmland in the plains. For every two acres of land reclaimed from old brick and tile kilns, one acre of land is allowed to be occupied in hilly and mountainous areas. Strict land acquisition procedures are enforced, production periods are regulated, and farmland occupation taxes are collected as per regulations. It is also required that departments such as transportation, electricity, banking, and water conservancy provide convenience for the relocation of brick and tile factories to hilly and mountainous areas. Townships and villages in hilly and mountainous areas also adopt preferential measures to attract skilled workers from the plains to set up factories in other places.

	The city government also follows the principle of "taking from the land and using it for the land," allocating a portion of the farmland occupation tax to subsidize the reclamation of farmland. For every acre of brick and tile kiln land reclaimed, 50 yuan is subsidized. The city has also issued reclamation targets for farmland, implementing a reward and punishment system for township and village cadres. So far, the entire city has rectified 74 old brick and tile kilns in the plains, withdrawing 3,063 acres of excess farmland. Five brick and tile kilns have already relocated to hilly and mountainous areas. A total of 2,370 acres of brick and tile kiln land have been reclaimed.

### 砖窑瓦场移出耕地迁向丘陵  榆次市制订政策复垦耕地

　　砖窑瓦场移出耕地迁向丘陵
    榆次市制订政策复垦耕地
    本报讯  被称为“地老虎”的榆次市上百座砖瓦场，近几年每年要吃掉耕地５００余亩。１９８８年，榆次市政府充分发挥政策调控作用，初步控制住了这群“地老虎”。
    近几年砖瓦生产成为榆次市农民致富的支柱产业。但是，也带来了十分严峻的后果，据去年初统计，全市共建起１４８座大型机砖窑，占地毁地多达５４１２亩。
    本着一不堵塞农民致富的生财之路，二不影响国家建设，三不毁坏耕地，尽量节约耕地的原则，榆次市政府发挥政策调控效应，鼓励砖瓦生产向粘土丰富的丘陵山区转移。
    去年上半年，市政府转发了有关部门制订的规定。明确指出，今后在平川地区的耕地上一律不准再新办砖场。每恢复原旧砖瓦窑占地２亩，允许在丘陵山区占地一亩。严格征地手续，规定生产年限，按规定交耕地占用税。并要求交通、电力、银行、水利等部门要为砖瓦场向丘陵山区转移提供方便。丘陵山区的乡、村也采取优惠办法，吸引平川技术能手到山区异地办场。
    市政府还根据“取之于地，用之于地”的原则，从收取的耕地占用税中提出一定的资金，对恢复耕地给予补助。复垦一亩砖瓦窑占地，补款５０元。市里还下达了复垦耕地指标，对乡村干部实行超奖减罚。截至现在，全市共整顿平川旧砖瓦窑７４座，退出多占耕地３０６３亩，有５座砖瓦窑已迁往丘陵山区“落户”。已复垦砖瓦窑占地２３７０亩。 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（雷郭堂）
