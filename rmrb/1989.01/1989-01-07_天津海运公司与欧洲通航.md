On December 31, 1988, Tianjin Shipping Company launched its first container ship to Rotterdam and Hamburg. This was the first time a local shipping company in China opened a European ocean route.

Tianjin Shipping Company has grown from owning just one ship in 1980 to ten ships today. It has expanded its routes from Hong Kong to multiple lines in Japan and Southeast Asia. The company's realized profits and taxes have increased from tens of millions of yuan eight years ago to over 50 million yuan last year, making it the second-largest non-trade foreign exchange earner in Tianjin.

(Tianjin Shipping Company has conducted a thorough self-examination during its rectification and reorganization. Before the State Council ordered the reduction of investments in office buildings and other facilities, the company proactively halted the construction of its planned business building. The report published on the second page of the November 3, 1988 edition of this newspaper, which criticized the company for rushing the design and preparing for construction, contained errors. —Editor)

　　天津海运公司与欧洲通航
    本报讯  记者肖荻报道：一九八八年十二月三十一日，天津海运公司开出试航鹿特丹和汉堡的第一艘集装箱船。这是我国地方海运公司开通欧洲远洋航线的第一次航行。
    天津海运公司，拥有的船舶已从一九八○年开业时的一艘船发展到十艘，从仅通航香港发展到去日本及东南亚多条航线。该公司实现的利税从八年前的几十万元，发展到去年的五千多万元，并成为天津市非贸易创汇第二大户。
    （天津海运公司在治理、整顿中认真自查，在国务院下令压缩楼堂馆所投资项目前，即主动停建筹建中的营业楼。本报去年十一月三日二版批评他们突击设计、准备施工的报道有误。
