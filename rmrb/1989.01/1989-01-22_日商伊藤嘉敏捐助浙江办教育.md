Japanese businessman Ito Katsutoshi has recently proposed to the Zhejiang Provincial People's Government that he will donate 3 million yen to support the development of education in Zhejiang Province.

Ito Katsutoshi has been cooperating with the Zhejiang Provincial International Trust and Investment Corporation since 1982, establishing four processing points for Japanese kimono dyeing in rural areas of Hangzhou. He told reporters, "Assisting Zhejiang in developing education is just like our business cooperation over the past few years. I am willing to do my best for the long-term friendship between China and Japan." The Zhejiang Provincial People's Government has decided to accept Ito Katsutoshi's donation.
