The head of the State Council's Housing Reform Office today issued a statement on strengthening the management of public housing sales prices, reiterating that the prices of public housing sales should be reasonably determined in accordance with relevant State Council documents to prevent low-price sales of public housing.

The official said that selling public housing is a key aspect of current housing system reforms and an important means of achieving "housing privatization and housing for all." Local governments should prioritize this work, seize the opportunity to push it forward, and strive to achieve significant breakthroughs this year.

Since the State Council issued the implementation plan for phased and batch-wise housing system reforms nationwide and the opinions on encouraging employees to purchase public old housing in February last year, the sale of public housing has been carried out in many cities and towns, achieving good social and economic effects. However, some places have sold public housing at prices lower than those stipulated in relevant national documents. Some have even engaged in price-cutting competitions, which is detrimental to the deepening of housing system reforms.

The official emphasized that all public housing that can be sold (including public housing directly managed by real estate management departments and public housing managed by various units) should be sold at full standard prices. All forms of subsidized sales and limited property rights sales should be immediately stopped. When selling new housing to employees, the price should be based on the standard price, which includes the construction cost of the housing itself plus land acquisition and demolition compensation fees. For old houses, the price should be calculated based on the replacement cost, depreciation, and environmental factors. Prices should not be determined arbitrarily, and sales prices should not be lowered at will.

Before selling public housing, it must undergo price appraisal by a price appraisal agency to determine the selling price. To this end, real estate management departments in various cities and towns should immediately establish real estate price appraisal agencies and, in conjunction with price departments, formulate appraisal standards for the sale of public housing.

The official finally said that to strengthen the management of public housing sales prices, local governments should strengthen their leadership over the real estate market. Housing reform, price, and real estate management departments at all levels should strengthen guidance and supervision of public housing sales prices. For public housing sold at low prices, real estate management departments should not handle transfer procedures or issue property certificates before the issue is resolved. For those who engage in new forms of malpractice, seek personal gain, or violate laws and regulations in the sale of public housing, whether individuals or units, they should be dealt with seriously.

　　国务院房改办负责人发表谈话时指出
    加强公房售价管理防止贱卖
    本报北京１月７日讯  记者鲁牧报道：国务院住房制度改革领导小组办公室负责人今天就加强出售公有住房价格管理发表谈话，重申公有住房的出售价格应按国务院有关文件规定合理确定，防止贱价出售公有住房。
    这位负责人说，出售公有住房，是当前住房制度改革的重点，是实行“住房私有化，居者有其屋”的重要途径。各地政府要把这项工作放在突出地位，不失时机地抓紧抓好，力争在今年取得重大突破。
    自去年２月国务院下达关于在全国城镇分期分批推行住房制度改革实施方案与鼓励职工购买公有旧住房的意见以来，出售公有住房的工作已在相当一部分城镇开展起来，并取得了良好的社会效果和经济效果。但是，有些地方也出现了不按国家有关文件规定，贱价出售公房的现象。有的甚至互相攀比降低出售价格，对于深化住房制度改革十分不利。
    这位负责人强调指出，凡属能够出售的公有住房（包括房地产管理部门直接管理的公房和各单位自己管理的公房）一律实行按标准价全价出售，立即停止各种补贴出售、有限产权出售的作法。向职工出售新建住房，应按标准价即住房本身建筑造价加上征地、拆迁补偿费计价；旧房按重置价成新折扣和环境因素等计价。不得自行确定计价原则，随意降低售价。
    公房在出售前，必须经房价评审机构进行价格评估，确定售价。为此，各城镇房地产管理部门应立即建立房地产价格评估机构；并会同物价部门制定公房出售价格评估标准。
    这位负责人最后说，为强化公有住房出售价格管理，各级政府要加强对房地产市场的领导。各级房改、物价和房地产管理部门，要加强对公有住房出售价格的指导和监督。对贱价出售的公房，在未作处理以前，房地产管理部门不予办理过户手续，不发房屋产权证。对于在公房出售中搞新的不正之风，以权谋私、违法乱纪的，不论单位或个人都要予以严肃处理。
