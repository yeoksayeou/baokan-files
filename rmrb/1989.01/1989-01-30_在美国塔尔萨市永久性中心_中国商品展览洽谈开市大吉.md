In the permanent "China Export Goods Exhibition and Trade Talks Center" in Tulsa, a midwestern city in the United States, an exhibition was recently held. In just five days, the total transaction amount reached $15 million.

The exhibition is held at the Williams Exhibition Center in Tulsa. Goods from 17 provinces and municipalities in China, covering 14 categories and over 4,000 samples, fill the 9,000 square feet exhibition hall. The diverse array of Chinese goods sparked great interest among American businesspeople. Nearly a thousand businesspeople from Tulsa and surrounding states came to discuss business, signing over 20 supply contracts and over 50 cooperation projects in just five days.

This exhibition, primarily focused on trade, saw most of its products find sales channels. Among them, watches, lamps, building materials, silk, silk scarves, and radiators were particularly popular. The permanent "China Export Goods Exhibition and Trade Talks Center" was established by China's Sino-American Small and Medium-sized Enterprises International Exchange and Liaison Office.
