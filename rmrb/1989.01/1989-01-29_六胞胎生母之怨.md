	The Grievances of the Mother of Sextuplets
	Liu Di

	“I have become a prisoner of my children,” said a South African mother of sextuplets. Perhaps this is the most famous family in the world: in January 1974, a young couple, Colin and Sian, who already had two children, gave birth to six more in one pregnancy. Although six children in one pregnancy did not break the world record, the fact that all six children were healthy and survived was unprecedented in the world.

	The six children have distinct appearances because they are six-egg siblings. Now, these children are already 15 years old. However, not long ago, this large family broke apart. Mother Sian and Father Colin announced their divorce. Sian, overwhelmed, said, “I have been torn to pieces by the children.”

	People remember that in 1977, Sian still said lightly, “Raising one child is the same as raising six!” Now, she knows this is not the case at all! She is busy from morning to night, cooking for the children, washing clothes, and giving them baths; if one child catches a cold, the others are sure to catch it too. Her husband, who works as a salesman, is not financially well-off, making it difficult for the couple to support this large family.

	They used “ovulation inducers” which led to the birth of six children. In recent years, there have been multiple reports of sextuplets being born. Sian solemnly advises, “I used ovulation inducers to have multiple births, which has made my life very miserable. Please do not use such drugs anymore.”

	When the six children were born, Sian was still a 25-year-old, energetic young woman. Now, as the children gradually grow up, she has already lost her youthful appearance. People think that perhaps she has reason to want to reclaim her lost youth.

　　六胞胎生母之怨
    刘迪 
    “我成了孩子们的囚徒”，一位南非６胞胎的母亲这样抱怨说。也许这是世界上最有名的家庭之一：１９７４年１月，已有两个孩子的年轻夫妇柯林和丝詹，一胎生下了６个孩子，虽然一胎６子未破世界纪录，但那些小生命全都健康地活下来了，这在世界上还属首次。
    这６个孩子的面貌各不相同，因为他们是６卵同胞。现在，这些孩子已经１５岁了，然而就在不久前，这个大家庭却破裂了。母亲丝詹和父亲柯林宣布离婚。丝詹不堪重负，她说：“我已经被孩子扯得粉碎了。”
    人们记得，１９７７年，丝詹还轻松地说：“养一个孩子和养６个都一样！”现在，她知道这根本不一样！她一天从早忙到晚，为孩子们做饭、洗衣、洗澡；如果一个孩子得了感冒，其他孩子肯定也得传染上。她做推销员的丈夫在经济上也不宽裕，让他们夫妇撑起这个大家庭，实在有些勉为其难。
    他们是使用了“排卵诱发剂”才导致生６胎的。近年来，出生６胞胎的报道已有多次。丝詹语重心长地告诫说：“我是使用了排卵诱发剂才生多胎的，这使我的生活非常悲惨，请不要再使用这种药物了。”
    当这６个孩子出生时，丝詹还是一个２５岁、精力旺盛的少妇，现在，孩子们逐渐长大了，她却早已红颜消退。人们认为，也许她有理由需找回自己失去的青春。
