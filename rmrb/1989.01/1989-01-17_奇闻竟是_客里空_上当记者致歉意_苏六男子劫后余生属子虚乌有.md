A report that six men in Leninakan, Armenia, had survived 35 days buried under the rubble of an earthquake has been proven false.

The reporters from the TASS news agency, Shahnazaryan and Shahbazyan, who first broke the story, have apologized to their readers. They wrote that after a thorough investigation, Akopyan's claims could not be verified.

On January 12, 50-year-old Akopyan from Leninakan told TASS reporters that he and five neighbors were moving items in the basement of a nine-story building when the earthquake struck. They allegedly spent 35 days underground and were rescued on January 11. Soviet Central Television aired footage of Akopyan answering questions from reporters. Soviet central newspapers published the "miracle" story on January 13, accompanied by a photo of Akopyan.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Moscow on January 13, the TASS news agency, Izvestia, and Central Television raised doubts about the story of the six men who were supposedly rescued from the rubble of a residential building after the earthquake. They questioned: Who rescued these six people? Why haven't the citizens of Leninakan heard about this "miracle"?

 　奇闻竟是“客里空”  上当记者致歉意
　 苏六男子劫后余生属子虚乌有
    新华社莫斯科１月１５日电  苏联亚美尼亚列宁纳坎市６名男子在地震废墟下被埋３５天后重见天日的消息是假的。
    最先报道这一消息的塔斯社记者沙赫纳扎良和沙赫巴江今天向读者表示道歉。他们写道，经过详细调查发现，阿科皮扬的说法未能得到证实。
    列宁纳坎市５０岁的阿科皮扬１月１２日对塔斯社记者说，他同５个邻居在其９层楼的地下室搬东西时发生地震，他们在地下度过３５天后于１１日被挖了出来。苏联中央电视台播放了阿科皮扬答电视台记者提问的镜头。苏联各中央报纸１３日刊登了这一“奇闻”，并配有阿科皮扬的照片。
    据新华社莫斯科１月１３日电　关于６名男子被地震埋在住宅楼废墟下重见天日的消息，塔斯社、《消息报》和中央电视台今天提出了疑问：是谁把这６人救出来的？为什么列宁纳坎市民没有听说这个“奇迹”？
