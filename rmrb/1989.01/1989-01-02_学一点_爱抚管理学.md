	Learning a Bit of "Affectionate Management"
	Zhao Zhenyu

	"Love your employees, and they will love your enterprise a hundredfold." This is a new management principle proposed by many business leaders in developed countries in Europe and America, known as "Affectionate Management."

	Recently, the Party Central Committee has proposed to improve the ideological and political work in enterprises, with one of the basic principles being to understand, care for, and respect people. Factory directors should not only focus on material production but also on ideological work and improving the quality of people. Therefore, it seems necessary for factory directors and managers to learn a bit of "Affectionate Management."

	The vitality of an enterprise lies in the enthusiasm and creativity of the majority of employees, and the development of enthusiasm and creativity requires respect, affection, and rewards from people, especially leaders. The "Enterprise Law" grants factory directors administrative, personnel, and reward and punishment powers, which is beneficial for factory directors to unify the command and dispatch of production. However, this does not mean that in terms of personality, factory directors should be superior to others. On the contrary, factory directors and workers are both masters of the enterprise and should understand, care for, and respect each other on an equal basis, although the role of factory directors requires more attention.

	When it comes to caring for and showing affection to people, some business leaders equate it with money and goods, as if only money and material things can motivate people's enthusiasm. History has developed to the 1980s, but some of our business leaders are still using the economic man hypothesis theory that was popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries abroad to treat workers, viewing workers as people who only need monetary incentives. This page, foreign wise business leaders have long turned over. When our enterprises are constantly introducing the most modern equipment and technology from abroad, shouldn't we also "introduce" some modern management methods and means? Understanding, caring for, and respecting people is not only a basic principle that our enterprise leaders should follow, but it has also become a theme of the entire civilized society. It should be better implemented in socialist China.

	Understanding people means to be familiar with the employees' physical, psychological, knowledge, technical, family, and living conditions, and to show understanding of their thoughts and behaviors—including rewarding good behaviors and results, as well as criticizing, punishing, and providing effective specific help for failures and mistakes from a positive intention.

	Caring for people means to pay attention to the material and spiritual needs of employees and to satisfy them as much as possible under possible conditions. For temporary unsolvable or inappropriate employee requests, they should be explained and corrected properly through smooth dialogue.

	Respecting people primarily means respecting people's dignity, ensuring that employees are masters of the enterprise, and not allowing any infringement or desecration of employees' rights. Dr. Blanchard, an American scholar, said that it is best for people to manage their own behavior, which is true for both managers and managed people. Effectively guaranteeing employees' participation in enterprise management is an effective way to develop employees' sense of responsibility and mastery, and it is also an important manifestation of respecting people in the enterprise.

	The content of "Affectionate Management" is very rich, such as being good at discovering and encouraging employees' strengths, being good at turning employees' negative factors into positive factors; when using rewards and punishments, generally, the number of rewards should be more, and the number of punishments should be less; the atmosphere of rewards should be thicker, and the atmosphere of punishments should be thinner; the occasions for rewards should be bigger, and the occasions for punishments should be smaller, and so on.

	Of course, proposing to learn a bit of "Affectionate Management" is not a new idea or creation. Understanding, caring for, and respecting people are inherently part of socialism and do not contradict strengthening management and strict requirements. The problem often lies in the fact that some of our business leaders are not strict when they should be and do not show affection when they should. In management, they do not follow scientific principles, are too simple, and even rely on patriarchal methods, which means they cannot run the enterprise well.

### 学一点“爱抚管理学”

　　学一点“爱抚管理学”
    赵振宇
    “爱你的职工吧，他会百倍地爱你的企业。”这是欧美发达国家许多企业家提出的一项管理新原则，名曰：“爱抚管理学”。
    最近，党中央提出要改进企业的思想政治工作，其中一项基本原则就是要理解人、关心人、尊重人。厂长不仅要抓物质生产，而且要抓思想工作，抓人的素质的提高，为此，提倡厂长、经理学一点“爱抚管理学”看来也是有必要的。
    企业的活力在于广大职工的积极性和创造力，而积极性和创造力的开发又需要人们特别是领导的尊重、爱抚和奖赏。《企业法》赋予厂长行政、人事、奖惩的权利，有利于厂长统一指挥调度生产。但是，这丝毫不意味着在人格上厂长要高人一头。相反，厂长和工人都是企业的主人，都应在平等的基础上相互理解、关心和尊重，只不过由于厂长的角色需要更注意罢了。
    一说到对人们的关心、爱抚，有些企业家就把它和钱物结合起来，似乎只有金钱、物质才能调动人们的积极性。历史已发展到２０世纪８０年代，可我们有些企业家还在用上世纪末至本世纪初国外流行的经济人假设理论来对待工人，把工人看成是只需要金钱刺激的经济人。这一页，国外聪明的企业家早已翻过去了。我们的企业，在不断引进国外最现代化的设备和技术时，难道不该同时“引进”一些现代化的管理方法和手段么？理解人、关心人、尊重人，已不只是我国企业家所应遵循的基本原则，它已成为整个文明社会的主题，在社会主义中国理应得到更好的实施。
    理解人就是要熟悉职工的生理、心理、知识、技术、家庭、生活等方面的情况，对其思想和行为表示理解——包括对良好行为和成果的奖赏，以及对失败和差错从积极愿望出发的批评、惩罚和有效的具体帮助。
    关心人就是要重视职工物质和精神各方面的需要，在可能的条件下尽量予以满足。对一时不能解决或职工的不当要求，则应通过畅通的对话方式妥善说明和指正。
    尊重人首要的就是尊重人的人格，保障职工在企业的主人翁地位，不允许任何侵犯和亵渎职工权利的现象发生。美国学者布兰查德博士说过，最好是人们能管理自己的行为，这一点对管理人和被管理的人来说都是对的。切实保证职工参与企业管理是发挥职工责任感和主人翁精神的有效方法，也是尊重人在企业的重要表现。
    “爱抚管理学”的内容是十分丰富的，如善于发现和鼓励职工的优点和长处，善于把职工身上的消极因素转化为积极因素；在运用奖励和惩罚时，一般来说，奖赏的次数宜多，处罚的次数宜少；奖赏的气氛宜浓，处罚的气氛宜淡；奖赏的场合宜大，处罚的场合宜小，等等。
    当然，提出学一点“爱抚管理学”，也不是什么新观点、新创造，理解人、关心人、尊重人本来就是社会主义题中应有之义，与加强管理、严格要求不矛盾。问题往往在于，我们有些企业家该严的不严，该爱的不爱，在管理中不讲科学，过于简单，甚至还是靠家长制的办法，那就办不好企业了。
