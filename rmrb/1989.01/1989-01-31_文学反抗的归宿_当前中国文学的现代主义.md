Title: The Destination of Literary Rebellion: Modernism in Contemporary Chinese Literature

Literary rebellion inevitably leads to modernism. This is not a sudden phenomenon but a natural outcome of literary introspection. The core of this introspection is that self-isolation has led to a terrifying consequence: we are forced to confront a Chinese-style cultural desert and spiritual ruin. China has been arrogant due to its cultural richness, but it has also become self-deprecating due to cultural decline and destruction. In this unique era, the dual contradictions of the Chinese cultural character are strikingly prominent.

Chinese literature's interest in modernism is driven by a desire to repair and extend. It is not about replacing something with modernism, but rather feeling a need due to a perceived deficiency. It is also not about using modernism to construct another monolithic system—we still remember the literary disasters of monolithic systems, and both our emotions and reason reject the repetition of tragedy.

When a powerful cultural tide surges, wise individuals would rather be suspicious or even criticized as promoters. In fact, they view the introduction and repair of Western modernism as an opportunity to "oxygenate" Chinese literature—to prevent it from suffocating. Based on this, the much-discussed issue of the authenticity of modernist works is no longer important. What is truly needed is a new infusion. For the "anemia" caused by past single-nutrient supplementation, this infusion is undoubtedly crucial.

The idea of modernizing Chinese society has gained widespread acceptance. The modernization of Chinese literature is a corresponding adjustment to this premise. In the modernization of literature, the renewal of artistic concepts and artistic thinking is the most substantial content. Rigidity and stiffness have caused set rules. Therefore, breaking through these rules is a necessary choice to save the literary crisis. In the fields of Chinese culture and thought, the feudal night is still long and dense. Thus, the introduction of modernist artistic elements becomes a remedy, although not the only one.

Feeling a sense of scarcity and poverty is a form of awakening. The vanguard of contemporary Chinese intellectuals was the first to achieve this awakening. Long-term isolation has led to a genuine hunger for nutrition. It is not "as hungry as a wolf," but rather "starving and indiscriminate." Awakened Chinese people are willing to acknowledge its rationality.

In reality, China lacks the foundation and conditions for the birth and survival of modernism. Moreover, as a literary trend, modernism has a long history and is not a "new thing." China's current intentions and actions are merely a matter of "convenient utilization."

Of course, since there is such a possibility of being utilized, it indicates that phenomena at different times and places have some unspoken consensus. The most important factor here is that literature, as a form of criticism (whether of society or of literature itself), embodies common values in different times and spaces. The West uses modernism to criticize the destruction of industrial civilization on the human self; China uses it to criticize the destruction of the living environment caused by man-made social mutations. Both unconsciously embody social rebellion through literary rebellion, although the nature of this rebellion is different.

Chinese literature does not demand a violent takeover by modernism—although some may hope for such a takeover—but it does demand a change in mindset, specifically a change from narrow-mindedness that leads to both psychological and practical artistic exclusion. The self-aggrandizement and sectarian exclusivity of a literary form have destroyed the natural ecology of literature. This painful experience has awakened the current impulse.

What is required here is a non-violent, peaceful integration and infiltration, a quiet dissolution, and friendly competition. Isolated China yearns to engage in spiritual dialogue with the world using new language. Dialogue is a form of communication, and communication requires a modern language that everyone can understand. In this situation, modernism provides the possibility for such dialogue: it can eliminate language barriers caused by differences in ideas.

The intrusion of the modernist specter has made some people restless. Their mindset is more of a lack of confidence than confidence. They lack an understanding of the strength of Chinese culture and literature and the resilience to resist external influences. They proclaim strength verbally but acknowledge weakness psychologically. Lack of confidence leads to neurasthenia; they view this Western "wild ox" as terrifying, fearing it will devour the family's ancestral garden and cause desolation.

These people's sense of crisis is different. In fact, on this ancient continent, any distant visitor or "unidentified flying object" will eventually be submerged in the mire—if they do not consciously resist. Everything will be assimilated and disappear under the name of "Chinese-style," including modernism, which will be "digested" in the "Chinese-style" stomach. The real danger is that everything will be "eaten" by China, rather than the other way around.

Current expectations for Chinese literature vary from person to person. Some, in a heavy sense of loss, hope to restore the unified project that began in the 1950s; some, in a great surge of energy, hope to use the awakening of modern art to completely transform the old literary system; others designate a certain literary trend, such as the "roots-seeking" literary trend or the "reform literature" trend, as the main trend or the best model... All of these unconsciously view a unified structure as the ideal order.

The expectation for this new literary revolution in mainland China is not a new unified system but new fragmentation and chaos. When Chinese literature negates a man-made mainstream, we will make progress. Similarly, when we willingly acknowledge that literary chaos is a norm, the literary clouds over our heads will disperse. Returning to the main theme of this short article, our current approach to modernism, both in motive and result, decisively rejects replacement. If we expect a unified system of modernism, it similarly means the arrival of a new tragedy.

### 文学反抗的归宿——当前中国文学的现代主义

　　文学反抗的归宿
    ——当前中国文学的现代主义
    谢冕
    现代主义重新成为中国大陆文学的热门话题并非一个突发现象。这是一个由文学反思导致文学反抗的必然归宿。这一文学反思的基本内容是：自我封闭造成了一个可怕的后果，我们不得不痛苦地面对一个中国式的文化荒漠和精神废墟。中国因文化富足而自大，又因文化中衰以致毁灭而自卑。在这个特殊的时代，中国文化性格的两重矛盾现象惊人地突出。
    中国文学对现代主义产生兴趣，受到一种修补和展延愿望的驱使。不是要用现代主义来代替什么，而是因需要而感到了缺陷；更不是要用现代主义来建构另一个一体化——一体化的文学灾难对我们记忆犹新，情感和理智都不允许悲剧的重演。
    当一股强大的文化思潮推涌而来，明智之士宁愿做一名受到怀疑乃至责骂的推波助澜者。他们事实上是把引进和修复与西方现代主义的联系，当作是给中国文学“充氧”的机会——以挽救中国文学不至于窒息。基于上述，人们谈论得很多的现代派真伪问题已无关重要，真正需要的是一种新的充填。对于以往那种单一营养补给造成的“贫血”，这种充填无疑至关重要。
    中国社会的现代更新，这一观念已经得到广泛的认同。中国文学的现代更新，则是与上述前提的相应协调。在文学的现代更新中艺术观念和艺术思维方式的更新是最具实质性的内容。刻板和僵硬曾经造成定则。因而冲破这一定则乃是挽救文学危机的必然选择。在中国文化和思想领域中，封建的暗夜依然漫长和浓重。因此，现代主义艺术因素的加入，便成为疗救的药石，尽管并非唯一的。
    感到匮缺和贫乏是一种觉醒。当今中国知识分子的前卫部分，最先获得了这一觉醒。长久的隔绝造成缺乏营养的真饥渴。不是“如饥似渴”，而是“饥不择食”，觉悟的中国人都乐于承认它的合理性。
    中国事实上缺乏现代主义产生和生存的基础和条件，而且作为一种文学潮流，现代主义已有长久的历史，也并非是“新鲜事物”。中国现时的意愿与行为不过是一种“方便利用”。
    当然，既然存在着这种被利用的可能性，便说明异时异地的现象之间有着某种不言自明的默契。其间最值得重视的因素，是文学作为一种批判（无论是对社会或对文学自身），在不同时空里均体现了共同的价值。西方以现代主义批判工业文明对于人自身的破坏；中国则借它批判社会的人为变异造成的对于生存环境的破坏。二者均不约而同地以文学反抗体现社会反抗，尽管这种反抗的质各不相同。
    中国文学对于现代主义并不要求强暴的取代——也许有人希望出现这种取代——但它要求一种观念的改变，即要求改变那种由褊狭造成的从心理到实践的艺术排斥。一种文学形态的自大狂症与宗派性排它，破坏了文学的自然生态。这一惨痛经历萌醒了如今这般的冲动。
    这里要求的是一种非暴力的和平加入与渗透，一种悄悄的消融和友善的竞争。与世隔绝的中国渴望用新的语言与世界进行精神对话。对话是一种沟通，而沟通必须有大家都能理解的现代语言。现代主义在这种情势下为这种对话提供了可能：它可以排除由于观念的歧异而产生的语言障碍。
    现代主义魔影的侵入，使一些人寝食难安。这些人的心态与其说是自信，不如说是不自信。他们对中国文化和文学的实力和抗拒外物的韧劲缺乏认识。他们口头上宣扬强大，而心理上只承认弱小。不自信造成了神经衰弱，他们视这一来自西方的野牛为可怖，他们深恐野牛会吃光自家祖传菜园里的种植而造成荒芜。
    这些人的危机感与别人不同。其实在这片古大陆的泥淖中，什么样的远方来客或“不明飞行物”或迟或早都将被淹没——要是他们不自觉进行抗争的话。一切都会在“中国式”的名义下受同化以至消失，包括现代主义也会在“中国式”这个怪胃中被“消化”。真正的危险是什么都将被中国“吃掉”，而不会是别物“吃掉”中国。
    当前关于中国文学的期待是因人而异的。有人在浓重的失落感中希望恢复五十年代开始的大一统工程；有人在巨大的冲动中希望用现代艺术的觉醒以全盘改造旧有的文学体制；有人则把某一种文学潮流，例如寻根文学潮流或“改革文学”潮流指定为主潮或最优模式……这一切都不约而同地把一体化的格局当作了理想秩序。
    中国大陆这一场新的文学革命的期待，不是一次新的大一统，而是新的破碎和混乱。什么时候中国文学否定了一种人为的主流化，什么时候我们就有了进步。同样，什么时候我们心甘情愿地承认文学的混乱是一种常态，什么时候我们头上的文学阴云便会散去。回到这篇短文的主旨上来，我们如今向着现代主义的接近，其动机和结果都决然排斥取代。如果我们期望现代主义的大一统，那同样意味着一场新的悲剧的降临。
