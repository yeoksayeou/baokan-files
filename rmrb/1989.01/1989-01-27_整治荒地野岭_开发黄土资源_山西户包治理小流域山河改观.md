Reclaiming wastelands and developing loess resources

The landscape of small watersheds in Shanxi has been transformed

People's Daily reports: In 1988, the western part of Shanxi Province experienced a once-in-a-century flood and heavy rain. However, the small watersheds that had undergone concentrated and contiguous treatment stood the test, significantly reducing soil erosion and achieving good results in grain, forestry, and livestock production.

Shanxi Province has 80% of its land covered by mountains and hills, with the western region along the Yellow River being a loess hilly and gully area where soil erosion is severe. Since 1982, farmers in western Shanxi have created a method of household-contracted treatment of small watersheds, unifying responsibility, rights, and benefits in soil conservation work, and combining treatment, management, and use. This method quickly gained the approval and imitation of mountain farmers. Over the past six years, Shanxi Province has invested 390,000 households in the treatment and development of small watersheds, accounting for 11.3% of the total rural households in the mountainous areas of the province. The province has treated a total area of 17.85 million mu, of which 10.74 million mu have shown initial results, accounting for 60% of the treated area. According to a sample survey of nine regions (cities), 1/4 of the contracted households have achieved significant economic benefits. The treated and developed small watersheds have built basic farmland facilities such as terraces, ditches, and dams, and planted trees, shrubs, economic forests, and grasses. According to statistics, each household has newly built 3.1 mu of fields, 20.4 mu of forests, 1.8 mu of orchards, and 2.2 mu of pastures. In 1988, Shanxi Province was hit by heavy rain and floods, but the total grain output reached 8.1 billion kilograms, an increase of 1 billion kilograms over 1987. The hilly and gully areas in western Shanxi also achieved a bumper harvest, demonstrating the effectiveness of small watershed treatment.

　　整治荒地野岭　开发黄土资源
    山西户包治理小流域山河改观
    本报讯  记者王艾生报道：１９８８年晋西北遭受百年不遇的暴雨和洪水袭击，而经过集中连片治理的小流域经受了考验，泥沙流失大为减少，粮食、林果、畜牧也都取得好成果。
    山西８０％的土地为山地和丘陵，西部沿黄河流域为黄土高原的丘陵沟壑区，水土流失严重。１９８２年以来，晋西北农民创造了户包治理小流域的方法，使水土保持工作中责、权、利统一，治、管、用结合，迅速得到山区农民的赞同和效仿。６年来，山西全省投入小流域治理开发的承包户已达３９万户，占全省山区总农户的１１．３％，全省共治理面积１７８５万亩，其中已有１０７４万亩见到初步效果，占治理面积的６０％。据９个地区（市）抽样调查，取得较显著经济效益的承包户占总承包户的１／４。经过治理开发的小流域，修筑了梯、沟、坝基本农田设施，种植了乔灌木和经济林木及牧草等。据统计，户均新建３．１亩田，２０．４亩林，１．８亩果园，２．２亩牧草。１９８８年山西普遍遭受暴雨、洪水袭击，全省粮食总产量达８１亿公斤，比１９８７年增长１０亿公斤，晋西北丘陵沟壑区也获得大丰收，显示了小流域治理的成果。
