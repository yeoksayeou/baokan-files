The *Tang People's Notes* records: In a certain place, there was a narrow road junction. One evening, a cart loaded with jars blocked the way, causing all the following vehicles to be unable to pass. As nightfall approached, the drivers were all very anxious. At this time, a man named Liu Pei asked, "How much are the jars in the cart worth?" The answer was, "Seven or eight thousand." Liu Pei immediately paid the full amount and had all the jars pushed off the cliff. Thus, the cart blocking the junction moved forward, and the following vehicles quickly passed through.

Recently, an old friend who works in basic construction vented his frustrations during a casual conversation about the current situation where some buildings are being halted or delayed. It turns out that the hotel he was responsible for constructing had just started construction, but recently, higher authorities decided to "halt" it. He believed this was a waste of manpower and resources, and thus, he couldn't understand it.

Currently, our economy is overheating, inflation is rising, and prices are soaring. One of the reasons is that the scale of basic construction is too large, especially in some places where too many buildings are being constructed. In some places, the people's basic needs for food and clothing have not been met, many primary and secondary schools still have dilapidated buildings, and many water conservancy projects urgently need repairs. However, some towns have built grand buildings and are engaged in a competition to build more. Only by adopting a "quick and decisive" approach to halt and delay construction can we prevent these issues from hindering the smooth progress of China's reform and construction.

　　刘颇赶车
    铁马
    《唐人笔记》中载：某地有个狭隘的路口，一天傍晚，有辆满载着瓦瓮的车子堵住了去路，使拥在后面的车辆都不能通过。眼看夜幕将临，赶车的人都十分焦急。这时有个名叫刘颇的人问道：“车里瓦瓮值多少钱？”答曰：“值七、八千。”刘颇当即付清了钱，叫人把所有的瓦瓮推于崖下。这样，堵在路口的车子就前进了，后面的车子也很快顺利通过。
    日前，一个搞基本建设的老友在闲聊中，对眼下停建缓建一些楼堂馆所怨天尤人的发起牢骚来。原来，他负责建设的那个宾馆，前不久刚破土动工，最近上级决定要将它“下马”。他认为，这是人力物力上的浪费。因而，总想不通。
    现在，我们经济过热，通货膨胀，物价上涨，原因之一，就是基本建设规模过大，特别是有些地方楼堂馆所造得太多。有的地方老百姓的温饱问题尚未解决，中小学校还有不少危房，一些水利工程也亟待维修，而一些镇上楼堂馆所却造得富丽堂皇，且互相攀比，继续大兴土木。只有用“快刀斩乱麻”的精神，停建，缓建。否则也会像那辆瓮车一样，阻碍我国改革和建设的顺利进行。
