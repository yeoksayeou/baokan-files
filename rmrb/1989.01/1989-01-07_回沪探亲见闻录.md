Not long ago, I returned to Shanghai to visit relatives. Compared to four years ago, Shanghai has seen changes and development in various aspects, but at the same time, I feel that some issues need to be addressed.

1. Mahjong playing has become widespread, and gambling has become public. During my stay in Shanghai, I visited relatives and friends ten times and encountered five instances of people playing mahjong. The players included elderly people in their sixties and seventies, as well as children in their teens. Sometimes the whole family would play together; other times, friends and neighbors would gather. Some played during their rest time at home, while others played during work hours. One neighbor told me that in their department of nine people, except for one person on duty, the other eight would set up two tables to play as soon as they started work. Most of these mahjong players gambled for money, with winnings and losses ranging from a few to several hundred or even a thousand yuan.

2. Many young people want to go abroad. During my stay in Shanghai, I met many young people and learned that most of them envied those who had gone abroad. Some were trying every means to find connections and opportunities to go abroad, referring to this as "overseas re-education" to make big money. Because of this, many young people were not focused on their jobs.

3. Ticket scalping is rampant. On some streets and in front of shops in Shanghai, various ticket scalpers can often be seen, selling tickets for televisions, bicycles, cars, and boats. A television ticket could be sold for hundreds or even thousands of yuan, and a train ticket, once passed through a scalper's hands, would double in price. The public had many complaints and urgently called for relevant departments to take action.

4. Some streets are both dirty and disorderly, affecting the city's appearance. In Shanghai, except for some main streets with better sanitation, other smaller streets are in poor condition. Especially on streets where commerce is conducted, it is rare to see anyone cleaning, and garbage is everywhere, making these places unbearable to look at.

5. Poor service attitudes. During my stay in Shanghai, I was asked by others to buy things in many stores. It was rare to see enthusiastic salespeople. The salespeople's attitudes were generally cold, and they would only respond after being called multiple times. Selecting items would even draw disapproving looks. Once, I bought a wool sweater at the famous Shanghai No. 1 Department Store. After requesting an exchange twice, the salesperson impatiently took back the sweater and ignored me.

### 回沪探亲见闻录

　　回沪探亲见闻录
    前不久，我回沪探亲。上海同４年前相比，各方面都有了不同程度的变化和发展，但同时也觉得有些问题应引起重视。
    一、玩麻将成风，赌博已经公开化。在沪期间，我去看望亲朋好友，１０次中有５次撞上人家正在玩麻将。玩麻将的既有六七十岁的老人，也有十几岁的小孩，有的是全家齐上；也有的是朋友、邻居凑在一起；有的是休息时间在家玩；也有的在上班时间玩。听一位邻居说，他们科共有９人，每天一上班，除１人值班外，其他８人就分两桌摆开了“战场”。这些玩麻将的多数赌钱，输赢少则几元数十元，多则几百元上千元。
    二、青年人普遍想出国。在沪期间，我接触了不少青年人，交谈中了解到多数青年人都十分羡慕别人出国，其中有的正在千方百计地到处拉关系、找门路，有些青年人把这种出国称为“洋插队”，可以挣大钱。为此，不少青年人不安心本职工作。
    三、票证倒卖猖獗。在上海的一些街道上和商店门口，经常可以看到各种票证贩子，既有倒卖电视机、自行车票的，也有倒卖车、船票的。一张彩电票能卖到数百元甚至上千元，一张火车票一经票贩子转手，价格就得翻番。群众对此意见纷纷，迫切要求有关部门加以整顿。
    四、一些街道既脏又乱，影响市容观瞻。在上海，除了一些主要街道的卫生状况较好外，其它一些小街道的卫生较差。尤其是一些经商设摊的道路，很少见到有人打扫，垃圾遍地皆是，已成了脏不忍睹的地方。
    五、服务态度差。在上海期间，我受人之托去不少商店买东西，服务热情的售货员已很少见。售货员态度都比较冷淡，顾客连叫几声他们才答应，挑选商品更会招来白眼。一次，我在闻名全国的上百一店买羊毛衫，因为要求调换了两次，售货员就不耐烦地将羊毛衫收了进去，不再理我了。
