Afghan resistance forces to halt attacks on Kabul airport

	U.S. officials say Soviets using new heavy bombs in Afghanistan

	ISLAMABAD, Jan. 22 (Xinhua) — According to a report by the Afghan News Agency today, the seven-party alliance of Afghan resistance forces has ordered its commanders in Kabul and Parwan provinces to stop attacking the airports in these two provinces, Kabul and Bagram, to ensure the safe withdrawal of Soviet military personnel and their families from Afghanistan.

	The report said that after the first direct talks between Soviet and Afghan resistance representatives in Taif, Saudi Arabia, last December, the resistance forces issued this order.

	The Soviet Union resumed its second phase of withdrawal from Afghanistan at the end of last year and, in accordance with the Geneva Agreement, will withdraw all its troops from Afghanistan by February 15. The Soviet Union had already withdrawn about 50,000 troops by August 15 last year.

	The report quoted resistance sources as saying that the order to halt attacks does not apply to Soviet bombers attacking freedom fighters and civilians. The resistance sources pointed out that this order should not be seen as part of a ceasefire, and the resistance will continue until the Kabul regime is overthrown.

	WASHINGTON, Jan. 21 (Xinhua) — U.S. State Department officials today claimed that the Soviet Union is using a new type of heavy bomb to attack Afghan anti-government guerrillas.

	These unnamed officials said this is the first time the Soviet Union has used such a bomb in the Afghan war. This bomb weighs over 5,440 kilograms and is the largest conventional bomb in the Soviet arsenal.

	They said the Soviets used this heavy bomb in the northern region of Kabul last week, apparently to protect Soviet troops scheduled to withdraw from Afghanistan by February 15. These officials said the United States will continue to provide military aid to the Afghan guerrillas until the Soviet Union stops supplying weapons to the Kabul regime.

　　阿抵抗力量将停止袭击喀布尔机场    
    美官员说苏在阿富汗使用新型重磅炸弹
    新华社伊斯兰堡１月２２日电  据阿富汗新闻社今天报道，阿富汗抵抗力量七党联盟已命令其在喀布尔省和帕尔万省的指挥官们，不要袭击这两个省的喀布尔和巴格拉姆机场，以保证苏联军官和他们的家属安全撤离阿富汗。
    报道说，在苏联和阿富汗抵抗力量的代表去年１２月于沙特阿拉伯的塔伊夫城举行首次直接会谈之后，抵抗力量就发出了这项命令。
    苏联在去年年底恢复了从阿富汗的第二阶段撤军，并根据日内瓦协议的规定，将在２月１５日之前从阿富汗撤出全部军队。苏联在去年８月１５日之前已撤出大约５万人。
    报道援引抵抗力量人士的话说，停止袭击的命令不适用于轰炸自由战士和平民的苏联轰炸机。抵抗力量人士指出，这项命令不能被认为是停火的一部分，抵抗将继续进行下去，直至推翻喀布尔政权。
    新华社华盛顿１月２１日电　美国国务院官员今天声称，苏联正在使用一种新型重磅炸弹攻击阿富汗反政府游击队。
    这些不愿披露姓名的官员说，这是苏联在阿富汗战争中第一次使用此种炸弹。这种炸弹重５４４０多公斤，是目前苏联武器库中最大的常规炸弹。
    他们说，苏联人于上周在喀布尔北部地区使用了这种重型炸弹，其目的看来是想保护即将在２月１５日之前撤离阿富汗的苏联军队。
    这些官员说，美国将继续向阿富汗游击队提供军事援助，直到苏联停止向喀布尔政权提供武器为止。
