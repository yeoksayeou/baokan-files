Zhejiang Establishes First Private Enterprise Union

According to Xinhua News Agency in Hangzhou on January 6, “We no longer feel inferior.” When a new sign for the “Zhejiang Province Fuyang Postal and Telecommunications Materials Factory Union” was recently hung at the entrance of this factory, a young female worker excitedly said.

This is the first private enterprise union established in Zhejiang Province.

The Fuyang Postal and Telecommunications Materials Factory was founded by retired worker Fang Xuemu. After more than four years of hard work, the factory has grown from 7 workers to 85, with fixed assets of 600,000 yuan and an annual output value of 1.5 million yuan.

Factory director Fang Xuemu believes that in new-type private enterprises, the relationship between workers and the owner should not just be one of employment and being employed. Instead, it should be like in state-owned factories, where workers also have their own organizations to establish their legal rights and status.

　　浙江成立第一家私营企业工会
    据新华社杭州１月６日电  （通讯员钱仁）“我们再也不感到矮人一头了”。当一块崭新的私营“浙江省富阳邮电器材厂工会”的牌子新近挂到这个厂大门口时，一位青年女工激动地说。
    这是浙江省成立的第一家私营企业工会。
    富阳邮电器材厂是由退休职工方雪木创办的。经过４年多艰苦创业，这个厂已由７名工人增加到８５名工人，拥有固定资产６０万元，年产值达到１５０万元。
    厂长方雪木认为，新型的私营企业，工人和业主的关系，不应该只是雇佣和被雇佣的关系，而应像国营工厂那样，也有工人自己的组织，确立他们的合法权益和地位。
