The new year has begun, and the Secretary of the Communist Party of China's Liaoning Provincial Committee, Quan Shuren, has written a letter to the 63 county (district) Party secretaries in the province. In the letter, he earnestly points out: "If we are to do something practical for teachers, we should first settle the outstanding payments to private teachers before the Spring Festival."

The latest feedback indicates that the provincial Party secretary's letter has sparked a strong response across the province. The 100 million yuan in outstanding payments to private teachers is expected to be fully settled in the near future.

Liaoning Province currently has 90,000 private teachers, with an annual labor compensation of approximately 1 billion yuan. Due to financial constraints in some regions and a lack of "respect for teachers" among certain leaders, the issue of outstanding payments to private teachers has been a long-standing problem. In some remote and impoverished townships, private teachers' compensation has not been fully paid for several years. This abnormal situation has caused difficulties for some private teachers' lives and has affected the stability of the private teacher workforce.

In December last year, the Party secretary and mayor of Fuxin Mongol Autonomous County took responsibility for the outstanding payments to private teachers, voluntarily deducting half of their own salaries. They also announced that by the end of December, if any township still owed private teachers' compensation, the township head and Party secretary would also have their salaries reduced until the problem was resolved. Under the direct supervision of the county Party secretary and mayor, the 4.79 million yuan in outstanding payments to private teachers in this county has been fully repaid. Upon learning of this news, Comrade Quan Shuren was very pleased and immediately made a note. Shortly afterward, he wrote a letter to the 63 county (district) Party secretaries in the province, pointing out: "Education is the foundation of a hundred-year plan. In school education, teachers are the key. Without respect for teachers, it is impossible to prioritize education. Without fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of teachers for teaching and educating people, school education cannot be successful." The issue of outstanding payments to private teachers in Liaoning's vast rural areas has not been thoroughly resolved, "which is unacceptable. Fuxin Mongol Autonomous County is one of the poorest counties in our province, and if they can solve the problem, other counties should be able to as well." Comrade Quan Shuren also suggested that county (district) Party secretaries review the important instructions from the central government and Comrade Deng Xiaoping regarding education, further examine and summarize the experiences and lessons of their educational work over the past few years, and strive to bring about a new situation in respecting and valuing teachers in the new year.

The provincial Party secretary's heartfelt letter has made the county (district) Party secretaries across Liaoning feel the weight of their responsibilities. Various places have quickly taken action to solve the problem of outstanding payments to private teachers. Gai County originally had 7 townships owing 1.2 million yuan in private teachers' salaries. The county Party committee decided that 7 standing committee members would be responsible for ensuring that all payments were made before the Spring Festival. The leaders of Tianwater Township in Liaoyang County actively sought loans from factories in other places and even sold a car and a color TV, using the proceeds to settle the outstanding payments to private teachers. Some county and district leaders have also taken the initiative to address issues such as dangerous school buildings, employment for teachers' children, and medical care, making comprehensive arrangements to do more practical things for teachers.

　　省委书记致函敦促各区县    
    辽宁春节前解决拖欠民办教师报酬
    新华社沈阳１月２４日电（光明日报记者苗家生、新华社记者魏运亨、夏阳）新年伊始，中共辽宁省委书记全树仁即给全省６３位县（区）委书记写了一封信，言辞恳切地指出：“如果说要为教师办一点实事的话，首先应该在春节前解决好拖欠民办教师报酬的问题。”最新反馈回来的情况表明：省委书记的这封信已在全省激起强烈反响，各地拖欠民办教师的１０００万元报酬可望在近期全部兑现。
    辽宁省现有民办教师９万人，每年应付的劳动报酬约为１亿元。由于一些地区财力紧张，更因为某些领导头脑中缺乏“尊师重教”的意识，全省拖欠民办教师报酬一直是个“老大难”问题。个别偏远贫困的乡镇，民办教师报酬已多年未能全部兑现。这种不正常状况，给一些民办教师的生活造成了困难，也影响了民办教师队伍的稳定。
    去年１２月，阜新蒙古族自治县的县委书记和县长，就拖欠民师报酬问题引咎自责，主动扣发了自己的一半工资，并且宣布，到１２月末，哪个乡仍拖欠民办教师报酬，乡长和党委书记也要减发工资，直到问题解决为止。在县委书记和县长的直接督促下，这个县拖欠的４７．９万元民办教师报酬已全部还清。全树仁同志得知这一消息后非常高兴，当即做了批示。紧接着，他又致信给全省６３位县（区）委书记，指出：“百年大计，教育为本。在学校教育中，教师是关键。不尊师就不可能重教。不充分调动广大教师教书育人的积极性，学校教育是搞不好的。”辽宁广大农村拖欠民办教师报酬问题至今没有得到彻底解决，“这是说不过去的。阜新蒙古族自治县是我省的贫困县，他们能解决的问题，其他县也应该能够解决。”全树仁同志还建议县（区）委书记重温中央和邓小平同志有关教育的重要指示，进一步对照检查几年来的教育工作，总结经验教训，争取在新的一年里，使尊师重教工作出现新气象。
    省委书记这封语重心长的信，使辽宁各县（区）委书记感到了沉甸甸的份量，各地迅速行动起来，解决民办教师报酬问题。盖县原来有７个乡镇拖欠民办教师工资１２万元，县委决定由７名常委包干负责，务必于春节前全部兑现。辽阳县甜水乡的领导主动去外地联办厂家借钱，同时还卖掉一辆小汽车和一台彩电，所得款项全部用于兑现民办教师的报酬。还有一些县区的领导举一反三，针对本地教育系统存在的危险房舍、教师子女就业、医疗等问题，进行统筹安排，努力为教师多办一些实事。
