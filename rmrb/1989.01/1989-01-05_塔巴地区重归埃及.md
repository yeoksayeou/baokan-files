The final boundary marker defining the disputed border between Egypt and Israel was jointly established by officials from both sides today. The Taba region, which has been in dispute for seven years, has finally been officially returned to Egypt's territory.

The Taba region covers an area of approximately 1 square kilometer. It was occupied by Israel in 1967. According to the 1979 Egypt-Israel peace treaty, Israel was supposed to return Taba to Egypt during its withdrawal from the Sinai in 1982. However, Israel refused to return Taba on various pretexts. In September of last year, the International Arbitration Commission ruled that Taba belongs to Egypt and determined the specific location of the crucial 91st boundary marker.

　　塔巴地区重归埃及
    本报开罗１月４日电  记者林皎明报道：划定埃及—以色列争端边界的最后一个界桩今天由双方官员共同确立，争议达７年之久的塔巴地区终于正式重新归入埃及版图。
    塔巴地区面积约１平方公里。１９６７年被以色列侵占。根据１９７９年埃以和约，以色列应在１９８２年西奈撤军时将塔巴交还埃及。以色列以种种借口拒绝归还塔巴。去年９月，国际仲裁委员会裁定塔巴归属埃及，并确定关键的第９１号界桩的具体位置。
