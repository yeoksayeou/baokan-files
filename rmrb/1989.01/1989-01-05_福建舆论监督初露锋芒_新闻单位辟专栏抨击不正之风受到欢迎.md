Fujian's public opinion supervision has shown initial effectiveness. News organizations have set up special columns to criticize improper practices and have received widespread approval.

The Fujian Daily's "Tide Sound" column, the Fujian Provincial Radio Station's "News Synthesis" program, and the Fujian Provincial Television Station's "News Half Hour" program have gained popularity among the people of the province for daring to expose contradictions in the reform and opening-up process and for boldly criticizing improper practices.

The Fujian Provincial Committee has treated public opinion supervision as a major task in promoting socialist democracy. Recognizing the difficulty in criticism, the provincial committee has required all levels of leadership to correctly understand the importance and necessity of public opinion supervision. They welcome and support the media in exposing and criticizing errors and shortcomings in work, encouraging the media to report both good and bad news, to promote advanced examples and to boldly expose evil practices. The leaders of the provincial committee and government not only emphasize this in various meetings but also practice what they preach, promptly addressing issues raised by newspapers, radio, and television, and checking the implementation of solutions.

The Fujian Municipal Committee has consistently held a welcoming and supportive attitude towards public opinion supervision. At the end of last year, the first movie theater in Fujian Province to implement a contract responsibility system, the Fujian People's Cinema, encountered difficulties when it resisted the forced assignment of leaders by the supervisory department. The "Tide Sound" column of the Fujian Daily and the "News Half Hour" program of the provincial television station exposed this issue. The Fujian Municipal Committee invited reporters to attend the standing committee meeting to solve the problem, clearly supporting the contractor. The two news organizations' three follow-up reports promoted the smooth implementation of the power delegation contract. "The 'Tide Sound' exposed our problems, directly participating in and promoting reform, and is our main channel for understanding public sentiment and studying society," said Municipal Committee Secretary Yuan Qitong, evaluating the role of the media in public opinion supervision. The Municipal Committee also issued an official document requiring cadres to do three things every day: read the People's Daily, Fujian Daily, and Fujian Evening News, and listen to radio and television news programs in the morning and evening. Special attention is paid to reports by news organizations criticizing the city, which must be promptly addressed and improved.

On the morning of September 25 last year, the "News Synthesis" program of the provincial radio station broadcast news about the construction of the Industrial Road cutting off telephone cables, causing dozens of factories to lose telephone service. The Municipal Committee and Government immediately held a meeting after hearing the broadcast, formulated emergency repair measures, and completed all repairs within a week.

On November 25 last year, after the municipal leaders watched the provincial television station's report criticizing the illegal sale of land in Fucheng County, they jointly sent a telegram to the county committee, ordering immediate investigation and punishment. After the county committee reported the investigation results to the television station and the municipal government, the municipal committee sent people to Fucheng to follow up and supervise the implementation of the measures.

The Wuyi Mountain Nature Reserve was damaged; chemical fertilizer was piled up in the chemical fertilizer plant; teachers' salaries were not paid for several months; streetlights in residential areas did not work; food factories used industrial additives to produce food... Such problems, once exposed, were immediately addressed by the relevant cities, counties, and departments: the damage was stopped; the chemical fertilizer was transported out of the factory, salaries were paid, streetlights were lit, and the factory director was dismissed... The power of public opinion supervision is evident. "We are not afraid of being reported, but we are afraid of being exposed in the media," which reflects the power of media supervision.

"We also find it difficult to run these columns (programs)," editors from "Tide Sound" and the provincial radio and television stations sighed. They talked about the obstacles to implementing public opinion supervision, primarily coming from the criticized units and their superiors. Some believe that criticism is "blackening," some try to intervene before publication, some persistently argue after publication, and some even complain to higher authorities. There are instances where those who report good news are warmly received, while those who report bad news are treated coldly. "Although we know it's hard work and unpopular, we have to persist. Because it is our duty. Strengthening the function of media supervision is in line with the direction of media reform," they told the reporter.

　　福建舆论监督初露锋芒
    新闻单位辟专栏抨击不正之风受到欢迎
    本报福州１月４日电  记者张铭清报道：福建日报《潮声》版、福建省电台《新闻综合》节目、福建省电视台《新闻半小时》节目，因敢于揭露改革开放中的矛盾，勇于抨击不正之风而深受全省人民的喜爱。
    福建省委把舆论监督作为发扬社会主义民主的一件大事来抓，鉴于现实存在的批评难的现象，省委要求各级领导正确认识舆论监督的重要性和必要性，欢迎和支持新闻界揭露批评工作中的错误和缺点，鼓励新闻界既报喜又报忧，既大力宣传先进又大胆揭露丑恶。省委省府领导不但在各种会议上这样强调，而且身体力行，对报纸电台电视台反映的问题及时批办，并检查落实情况。
    福州市委对舆论监督一直持欢迎和支持的态度。去年底，福建省第一家实行承包的福州大众影院，因抵制主管部门强行安排来的领导遇到了麻烦，福建日报《潮声》版和省电视台《新闻半小时》予以披露后，福州市委请记者列席解决问题的常委会，旗帜鲜明地支持承包者。两家新闻单位的３次追踪报道推动了放权合同的圆满履行。“《潮声》披露我们的问题，是直接参与和推进改革，是我们体察民情、研究社会的主渠道。”市委书记袁启彤这样评价新闻媒介履行的舆论监督作用。福州市还正式行文，要求干部每天必办三件事，看人民日报、福建日报和福州晚报，每天早晚听电台新闻节目、看电视新闻节目。特别对新闻单位批评本市的报道，要立即查办并改进工作。
    去年９月２５日早晨，省电台《新闻综合》节目播出工业路扩建施工切断了电话电缆，致使几十家工厂电话中断的消息，市委市府听完广播立即开会，制定抢修措施，一周内全部修复。
    去年１１月２５日，福州市委领导看完省电视台批评福清县非法买卖土地的报道后，联名打电报给县委，责成立即查处，县委将查处情况电告电视台和市政府后，市委又派人到福清跟踪监督落实情况。
    武夷山自然保护区受到破坏；化肥厂化肥积压；教师工资拖欠几个月没发；居民区路灯不亮；食品厂用工业添加剂生产食品……诸如此类的问题一经披露，有关地市县和部门当天就赶到现场处理问题：破坏被制止了；化肥被疏运出厂，工资发放了，路灯亮了，厂长被撤了职……舆论监督的威力是明显的。“不怕通报，就怕见报”道出了新闻监督的力量。
    “我们办这些栏目（节目）也很难。”《潮声》和省台、电视台有关编辑这样感叹。他们谈到实行舆论监督的阻力，首先来自被批评单位及其上级领导干部。认为批评即“抹黑”者有之，事前托人说情阻止者有之，事后纠缠不休者有之，向上级告状者亦有之。对报喜者接待热情有加，对报忧者冷若冰霜的情况时有发生。“明知吃力不讨好，我们还得坚持下去。因为这是我们应尽的义务。加强新闻监督的功能符合新闻改革的方向。”他们就是这样对记者说的。
