Lhasa's various circles deeply mourn the passing of Panchen Erdeni.

Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, January 30 (Reporters Duo Qiong, Wang Hao) Lhasa's various circles are in deep mourning for the sudden passing of Panchen Erdeni, the 10th Panchen Lama, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and Honorary President of the Chinese Buddhist Association.

After participating in the consecration ceremony of the stupa for the fifth to ninth Panchen Lamas in Shigatse and just returning to Lhasa, Lha Min, Vice Chairman of the Autonomous Region's Political Consultative Conference, heard the news of Panchen Erdeni's unfortunate passing. He said, "This is the most heartbreaking news for me. This is also a great loss for the country and an irreparable loss for all Tibetan people and the Buddhist cause."

Gonpo Sa, a living Buddha from the Drepung Monastery in Lhasa, told reporters of his grief, saying, "Panchen Erdeni not only did a lot of work to implement religious policies in Tibet and other Tibetan areas but also consistently maintained national unity and opposed ethnic separatism." He said, "We should follow the spirit of Panchen Erdeni's speech at the consecration ceremony of the stupa for the fifth to ninth Panchen Lamas a few days ago, strengthen national unity, maintain national unity, and continue the cause of prospering Tibet."

Xue Kang, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region's People's Congress, said, "I feel very sad. Panchen Erdeni is a true religious leader who follows the Communist Party, loves the country, loves the people, and loves religion. His passing is a loss for the entire nation, and the loss for Tibet is even greater."

Dan Zeng Zong, who served as a Khenpo (fourth-rank official) during the ninth and tenth Panchen Lamas and is now Vice Chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Region's Political Consultative Conference, said, "When Panchen Erdeni was critically ill, the Central Committee of the Party and the leaders of the Autonomous Region showed great concern, sending the best doctors. Although they could not save Panchen Erdeni in the end, they did their best. We in Tibet's religious circles and believers are grateful to them." He continued, "Panchen Erdeni has passed away, but with the Central Committee of the Party and the Party's policies on national and religious freedom, Tibet's national and religious causes will definitely continue and be strengthened. I and Tibet's patriotic people are very confident."

An elderly Tibetan woman, Bu Mu, choked back tears as she told reporters that she had watched Panchen Erdeni preside over the consecration ceremony in Shigatse on television just a few days ago, constantly praying for his well-being. She never expected that Panchen Erdeni would suddenly leave the monks and laypeople who love him.

Today, the Tibet Branch of the Chinese Buddhist Association sent a prayer to all the monks of Tashilhunpo Monastery. The prayer hopes that all the monks of Tashilhunpo Monastery, the main temple of the successive Panchen Lamas, will fully realize all the wishes of the 10th Panchen Lama. The prayer says, "Let us inherit the great achievements of the holy teacher, hold high the banner of patriotism, love the Communist Party of China, maintain national unity and ethnic unity, and strive unremittingly to promote Buddhism."

It is reported that the three major monasteries in Lhasa are preparing to hold religious rituals to pray for Panchen Erdeni.

　　拉萨各界人士对班禅大师逝世深为悲痛
    新华社拉萨１月３０日电（记者多穷、王浩）拉萨各界人士沉痛悼念全国人大常委会副委员长、中国佛协名誉会长、第十世班禅额尔德尼·确吉坚赞猝然逝世。
    参加五世至九世班禅合葬灵塔开光大典后刚从日喀则返回拉萨的自治区政协副主席拉敏·索朗伦珠获悉班禅大师不幸逝世的消息后说：“这是我最痛心的事。这也是国家的损失和所有藏族人民以及佛教事业不可挽回的损失。”
    拉萨哲蚌寺活佛贡巴萨·土登吉扎在向记者诉说他的悲痛心情时说：“班禅大师不仅为西藏和其他藏区落实宗教政策做了大量工作，而且始终如一地维护祖国统一，反对民族分裂。”他说：“我们要按照几天前班禅大师在五世至九世班禅合葬灵塔开光大典上的讲话精神，加强民族团结，维护祖国统一，把繁荣西藏的事业继续下去。”
    西藏自治区人大常委会副主任雪康·土登尼玛说：“我感到很伤心。班禅大师是一位真正跟着共产党走，爱国、爱民、爱教的好宗教领袖，他的去世是整个国家的损失，对于西藏损失更大。”
    曾在九世和十世班禅时期任过堪布（四品官）、现任西藏自治区政协副主席的丹增加措说：“班禅大师病重时，党中央和自治区领导非常关心，派了最好的医生来，虽然终没有能挽救班禅大师，但他们尽了力，我们西藏的宗教界和信教群众感激他们。”他接着说：“班禅大师去世了，但有党中央和党的民族、宗教信仰自由政策，西藏的民族、宗教事业一定会得到继续和巩固，我和西藏的爱国人士都很有信心。”
    藏族老阿妈布姆哽咽着对记者说，她前几天从电视里观看班禅大师在日喀则主持开光仪式时，一直合掌为班禅大师祝福，没想到现在班禅大师却突然离开了热爱他的僧俗人民。
    中国佛教协会西藏分会今天向扎什伦布寺全体僧众发出祷词。祷词中希望历代班禅的主寺扎什伦布寺的全体僧众圆满实现十世班禅的一切遗愿。祷词说：“让我们继承圣师的伟大业绩，高举爱国主义旗帜，热爱中国共产党，维护祖国统一和民族团结，为弘扬佛法而不懈努力。”
    据悉，拉萨三大寺正在为班禅大师举行祈祷佛事活动进行准备。
