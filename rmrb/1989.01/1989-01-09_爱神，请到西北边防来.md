Besides the wastelands, mountains, snow, and rifles that closely accompany them, officers in the western border defense also face an inescapable loneliness—love is stingy with them.

When the love of military officers extends from the countryside to the city, bitterness follows. A certain assistant, Xiao Yang, jumped off the train from Xi'an to Kuerle and sighed to the comrade who came to meet him, "Sigh, another trip in vain!"

This was Xiao Yang's fifth "empty" trip, but he still stubbornly wanted to find a "girlfriend" in Xianyang, even though he was not from Xianyang, and even though he had spent over 2,000 yuan in salary on the railway for this.

There are people like Xiao Yang in some units who persistently seek targets in the city, and this accounts for 100% of the rural officers. Unfortunately, city girls seem to have lost interest in the color of national defense. Moreover, the plight of military officers in their second job assignment has made many city girls give up the idea of seeking a military man as a partner. Therefore, the success rate of young officers seeking partners in the city is extremely low. A technician in a certain border defense unit had seven failed relationships in four years, a "seven to zero" record.

For this reason, the Lanzhou Military Region specially established a marriage introduction office, but this is like a drop in the bucket.

The reasons for the young officers' failures in love are many, and the harsh conditions and long distances cannot be ignored as major factors. In a certain border defense regiment, 31 officers had failed in love from last year to this year. A female friend of an officer traveled from a certain inland city to visit her lover in the Kunlun Mountains. She traveled for 20 days and had not yet reached her lover's station, but her leave was only 30 days! Her heart turned cold. She wrote a long letter and put it in the mailbox, turning around and going back. They never saw each other again.

A sergeant named Tian said that his girlfriend had just broken up with him and found a released prisoner, and they were about to get married. He couldn't understand it: "I am a lieutenant in the People's Republic of China!" Later, he learned that the girl often encountered some unsavory people on her way to and from work, and she was very afraid. This released prisoner often escorted her home, giving her a sense of security.

Rural officers find it difficult to find partners in the city, and those who enlisted from the city are not necessarily more fortunate. A certain company commander, Zhang, stationed on the Pamir Plateau, is from Urumqi. He is very handsome and had girls write him love letters when he was in college. After going to the border defense company, he found a teacher from the local area. At first, they almost exchanged letters every week. Suddenly, for a period, the girl did not receive any letters from Zhang for more than two months. She could not bear this coldness and made a new choice. Later, she received more than 20 letters from him at once, learning from the letters that the snow and floods on the plateau were merciless, cutting off the mail route. But it was too late...

At this moment, the Northwest border defense line is frozen in ice and snow, and the love letters sent by the border defense officers are likely to be obstructed again. Girls who are waiting for border defense love letters, please wait a little longer, the color of national defense needs warm feelings...

　　爱神，请到西北边防来
    杜献洲
    除了荒原、大山、冰雪和钢枪紧紧伴随他们之外，西部边防军官还有难以逃避的孤独——爱情对他们是吝啬的。
    当军官的爱情触角从田园进入城市，浓浓的苦涩也随之而来。某部助理员小杨从西安至库尔勒的列车上一跳下来，就对迎上来接他的战友叹道：“唉，又放空了一趟！”
    这是小杨第５次“放空”，但他仍顽强地要在咸阳市找一位“女朋友”，尽管他并非咸阳市人，尽管他为此在铁路上“扔”下２０００多元的薪金。
    像小杨这样孜孜不倦地在城市寻找目标的人，在有些部队农村籍军官中占１００％，遗憾的是城市姑娘对国防绿似乎已失去兴趣。况且军官们在第二次就业中“掉价”的窘境，使许多城市姑娘打消了寻军人为偶的念头。所以，青年军官在城市中求偶的成功率极低。边防某部一位技术员在四年之内，７次恋爱７次失败，“七比零”。
    为此，兰州军区专门设立了婚姻介绍所，这也是杯水车薪。
    青年军官失恋的原因很多，条件恶劣、路途遥远不能不说是一个主要因素。有个边防团，去年至今失恋的边防军官竟有３１个。一位军官的女朋友，从内地某市到昆仑山探望自己的恋人。她在路上走了２０天，还未走到恋人的驻地，可她的假期只有３０天！她的心凉透了。她写了一封长信塞进邮筒，转身回去了。他们再也没见面。
    一位姓田的排长说，他的女朋友刚与他分手后，找了一位劳改释放人员，并马上要结婚。他百思难解：“我是共和国一个堂堂的中尉军官啊！”后来他了解到，这位姑娘在上下班途中经常遇到一些不三不四的人纠缠，她很害怕。这位劳改释放人员经常护送她回家，给了她安全感。
    农村籍军官在城市寻偶难，从城市入伍的军官也不见得就很幸运。驻守在帕米尔高原某边防连的常连长，家在乌鲁木齐市。他长得很帅，上大学时，曾有姑娘给他写求爱信。到边防连后，他找了地方上一位教师。起初，他俩几乎每周都收到对方的信。突然一段时间，姑娘两个多月没收到常连长的信，她忍受不了这种冷漠，重新选择了。后来姑娘一下收到他２０多封信，从信中得知，高原上冰雪、洪水无情，断了邮路。但为时已晚了……
    此刻，西北边防线上冰封雪冻，边防军官们发出的情书，恐怕又要受阻了。正在盼望边防情书的姑娘们，请你们等一等吧，国防绿需要温暖的情怀……
