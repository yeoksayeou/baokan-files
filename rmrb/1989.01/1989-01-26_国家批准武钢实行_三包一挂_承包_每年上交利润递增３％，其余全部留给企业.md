The State Council has recently approved the contract responsibility system plan for Wuhan Steel (Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation).

Wuhan Steel's contract responsibility system implements the "three guarantees and one linkage" scheme, with a contract period of five years. Specifically, the first guarantee is the profit turnover, which uses the actual taxable income and adjustment tax from 1987 as the contract base. Starting from 1988, the annual turnover amount will increase by 3% each year, with the remaining profits all retained by Wuhan Steel, mainly used for transformation, expansion, and production development. The second guarantee is the transformation, expansion, and technological renovation, ensuring that by 1990, a comprehensive production capacity of 500 million tons each for steel and iron is formed, along with the technological renovation tasks approved by the state for the first two years of the "Eighth Five-Year Plan." The third guarantee is the completion of the mandatory plan, which is the annual production task of increasing 100,000 tons of steel as stipulated in the national steel industry input-output contract plan, which remains unchanged. Starting from 1989, the incremental part based on the 1988 mandatory steel production plan will be reported to the state, included in the national plan allocation channel, and the state-regulated sales price for excess production will be executed, but the required production conditions will be self-funded by Wuhan Steel. The "one linkage" refers to the linkage between the total wage and the realization of profits and taxes. The linkage ratio is: for every 1% increase or decrease in realized profits and taxes, the total wage will increase or decrease by 0.8%.

According to local economic experts, the implementation of Wuhan Steel's contract plan is beneficial to the state. The debt risk of Wuhan Steel's borrowing for construction is transferred to the enterprise through the contract, while the state's fiscal revenue is guaranteed in contractual form. During the contract period, Wuhan Steel's fiscal revenue turned over to the state will increase year by year.

　　国家批准武钢实行“三包一挂”承包    
    每年上交利润递增３％，其余全部留给企业
    新华社武汉１月２５日电（通讯员张冬生）国务院最近已批准武钢实行承包经营责任制的方案。
    武钢的承包经营责任制实行“三包一挂”方案，承包期为五年。具体讲，一包上交利润，即以１９８７年实际应交所得税和调节税为承包基数，从１９８８年起，每年上交数递增３％，其余利润全部留给武钢，主要用于改造、扩建和发展生产。二包改建、扩建和技术改造，确保到１９９０年形成钢、铁各５００万吨的综合生产能力和国家将批准的“八五”前两年技术改造任务。三包完成指令性计划，即在全国钢铁工业投入产出包干方案中所承担的每年增产１０万吨钢的生产任务不变。从１９８９年开始，以１９８８年指令性钢材生产计划为基数，递增部分向国家申报，纳入国家计划分配渠道，执行国家规定的超产产品销售价格，但所需生产条件由武钢自筹解决。“一挂”即工资总额与实现利税挂钩。挂钩比例为：实现利税每增加或减少１％，工资总额则增加或减少０．８％。
    据此间经济界人士说，武钢承包方案的实施对国家是有利的。武钢借钱搞建设的债务风险通过承包转移到了企业，而国家财政收入又以合同形式得到保证。在承包期内，武钢上缴国家的财政收入将逐年增加。
