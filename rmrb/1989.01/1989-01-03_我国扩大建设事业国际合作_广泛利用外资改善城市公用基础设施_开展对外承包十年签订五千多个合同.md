Since the reform and opening up, China has extensively utilized foreign capital to improve urban public infrastructure. At the same time, it has developed joint ventures and cooperative projects, engaged in overseas contracting, and expanded the scope of cooperation in the construction industry.

An official from the International Cooperation Department of the Ministry of Construction said that over the past decade, China has focused on international cooperation and exchanges, which has invigorated the international construction market. Currently, China has accepted 71 billion yen in loans to build four city gas plants and 12 city waterworks. Australia and the UK have provided loans and grants to China to improve urban infrastructure.

He introduced that joint ventures and cooperative projects have also emerged in recent years. Major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Guangzhou are home to dozens of large-scale construction joint ventures. The number of projects jointly operated or cooperated by state-owned enterprises or local enterprises with foreign companies is countless.

At the same time, China's overseas contracting market is becoming increasingly active. China has signed more than 5,100 contracts covering more than 10 industries, including construction, transportation, and railways. The transaction amount has reached 8.1 billion US dollars, with an annual profit of over 500 million US dollars. While consolidating and developing the Middle East and North African markets, China has also opened up the economically vibrant markets of Southeast Asia, Europe, and the Far East, including the Soviet Union. The scale of China's overseas construction cooperation projects is also continuously expanding, with billion-dollar projects becoming commonplace.

He pointed out that although China's construction industry's international cooperation is in its infancy, there are also problems that cannot be ignored. Repeated surveys and the phenomenon of "relationships" going abroad have disrupted normal diplomatic order. In overseas contracting projects, issues such as lax discipline among workers, high labor costs, language barriers, and systemic flaws in management have weakened our competitiveness in the international construction market.

He also pointed out that the external environment and order of China's construction industry still need further rectification and reform. It is necessary to strictly control repeated surveys, while reforming the current system of overseas contracting, reducing costs, and adopting the engineering general contracting method from planning, design to material and equipment procurement. This will improve the management level and expand the scope of operations.

　　我国扩大建设事业国际合作
    广泛利用外资改善城市公用基础设施
    开展对外承包十年签订五千多个合同
    新华社北京１月２日电  （记者陈新、实习生郑丽敏）改革开放以来，我国广泛利用外资，改善城市公用基础设施。同时，发展合资企业及合营、合作工程，从事对外承包工程业务，扩大了我国建设事业的合作领域。
    建设部国际合作司一位负责人说，十年来，我国注重开展国际合作与交流，繁荣了国际建筑市场。目前，我国已接受７１０亿日元贷款，用于建造４个城市煤气厂和１２个城市自来水厂。澳大利亚、英国分别贷款、赠款给我国用于改善城市的基础设施。
    据他介绍，我国合资企业和合营、合作工程近年来也应运而生。北京、上海、深圳、广州等大城市分布着几十家大型建筑合资企业。国营企业或地方企业与国外公司合营、合作的工程更是不计其数。
    同时，我国对外承包市场日渐活跃。我国已签订５１００多个合同，遍及建筑业、交通、铁路等１０多个行业。成交额达８１亿美元，每年获５亿多美元的利润。在巩固和发展中东、北非市场的同时，还开拓了经济较为活跃的东南亚、欧洲市场及远东的苏联市场。我国对外建筑合作工程的规模也不断扩大，上亿美元的工程项目屡见不鲜。
    他指出，我国建筑业对外合作虽方兴未艾，但存在的问题也不容忽视。重复考察、“关系”出国现象干扰了正常的外事秩序。对外承包工程中，工人纪律松弛、劳务成本高以及语言障碍和管理体制的弊端也弱化了我们在国际建筑市场的竞争力。
    他还指出，我国建设事业的外事环境及外事秩序还有待于进一步地治理和整顿。要严格控制重复考察，同时，改革对外承包工程的现行体制，降低成本，采取从规划、设计到材料、设备选购的工程总承包方式，提高经营层次，扩大经营范围。
