Beware of Ceramic Tableware Poisoning

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently recalled various high-end colored ceramic tableware manufactured in Italy from various department stores in the United States. The reason is that among Americans who used these ceramic items, symptoms of lead poisoning such as dizziness, headaches, fatigue, memory loss, and joint pain appeared. More seriously, someone in Seattle nearly died from lead poisoning after using an Italian coffee cup.

Tests showed that the lead content in these Italian ceramic tableware items was 50 times higher than the standard set by the FDA.

At the same time, the United States also recalled 12 types of toxic tableware from Hungary, Spain, Taiwan, and Thailand.

Ceramic tableware with high lead content, when in contact with acidic foods such as milk, coffee, beer, fruit juice, and soup, will gradually dissolve the lead in the paint. When the lead accumulates to a certain level in the human body, symptoms of lead poisoning appear.

Scientists surveyed 3,000 children and adolescents and found that even a small amount of lead in the blood can affect a child's hearing and reduce their language comprehension. If the blood lead level exceeds a certain limit, it can cause anemia, brain damage, acute lead poisoning, and even death.

To prevent lead poisoning, scientists suggest that people should not buy ceramic tableware with bright colors such as yellow, blue, and red. Instead, they should choose tableware that is plain on the inside, has sparse and simple colorful patterns, or has a transparent and smooth surface. These types of tableware contain less lead and have undergone high-temperature firing, making them safer to use.

　　谨防陶瓷餐具中毒
    美国药物管理局最近从美国各百货公司回收意大利制造的各种高级彩色陶瓷餐具。其原因是，在使用这些瓷具的美国人中出现了头晕、头痛、疲乏、记忆力减退、关节酸痛等铅中毒症状，更严重的是西雅图市有人因使用意大利咖啡杯而险些中毒死亡。
    据测定，这些意大利陶瓷餐具的含铅量比药物管理局规定的标准高出５０倍。
    与此同时，美国还回收了１２种来自匈牙利、西班牙、台湾、泰国的有毒餐具。
    含铅量高的陶瓷餐具，在接触牛奶、咖啡、啤酒、果汁、菜汤等酸性食物时，其颜料中的铅会一点点地被溶蚀出来，当进入人体的铅积聚到一定程度时，就出现铅中毒症状。
    科学家调查了３０００名儿童和青少年，发现血液中即使有少量的铅也会影响孩子的听力、降低对语言的理解能力。血液中含铅量高于一定限度，会造成贫血、脑受损、急性铅中毒而死亡。
    为了预防铅中毒，科学家们建议人们不要选购那些黄色、蓝色、红色等颜色鲜艳的陶瓷餐具，而应选购那些内里不带色彩的，或彩色花样疏简，或表面透明、光滑的陶瓷餐具。因为这些餐具含铅量少，而且又经过高温烧制，使用这种餐具就比较安全。
