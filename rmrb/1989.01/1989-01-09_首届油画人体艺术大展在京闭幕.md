The first national oil painting nude art exhibition closed in Beijing. On the west side of the courtyard of the National Art Museum of China, thousands of spectators, each holding a newly purchased "Oil Painting Nude Art Works Collection" and postcards, crowded around to have the artists sign their names. The artists were busy all day with this. This was the scene on the closing day of the first national oil painting nude art exhibition.

This exhibition attracted over 200,000 spectators. Vice Professor Ge Pengren of the Central Academy of Fine Arts said, "We hope that oil painting nude art, as a genre, can develop smoothly and normally in China."

It is understood that relevant department leaders have given academic recognition to this exhibition, which was organized by young and middle-aged oil painters with self-raised funds.
