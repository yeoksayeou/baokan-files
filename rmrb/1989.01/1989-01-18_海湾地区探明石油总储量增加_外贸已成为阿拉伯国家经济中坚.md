The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has six member states whose proven oil reserves account for 70.5% of the world's total proven oil reserves.

These six countries are Saudi Arabia, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Iran, and Venezuela. Except for Venezuela, which is located in Latin America, the other five countries are all in the Gulf region.

According to revised figures provided by the Middle East Economic Survey, the proven oil reserves of these six countries have increased by 308 billion barrels over the past five years, reaching 699 billion barrels. The reserves of these six countries are as follows: Saudi Arabia, 255 billion barrels; Iraq, 100 billion barrels; UAE, 98 billion barrels; Kuwait, 95 billion barrels; Iran, 93 billion barrels; Venezuela, 58 billion barrels.

These figures indicate that the Gulf region is the richest in oil resources in the world. The proven oil reserves of these five Gulf countries alone account for nearly two-thirds of the world's total reserves.

According to a recent report by Egypt's Al-Ahram Economist, foreign trade plays a crucial role in the economies of Arab countries.

The report states that the value of Arab countries' commodity exports was approximately $13 billion in 1970, $234 billion in 1980, and around $85 billion in 1986. The value of imports was approximately $8.8 billion in 1970, $116 billion in 1980, and $93.6 billion in 1987.

In 1970 and 1985, raw materials, oil, and chemical products accounted for 96% and 98% of Arab exports, respectively.

    新华社北京１月１７日电  尼科西亚消息：据《中东经济研究》周刊１６日报道，石油输出国组织（欧佩克）中６个成员国的原油储量占全世界已探明的原油总储量的７０．５％。
    这６个国家是：沙特阿拉伯、伊拉克、阿拉伯联合酋长国、科威特、伊朗和委内瑞拉。除委内瑞拉地处拉美外，其他５国均处海湾地区。
    据这家刊物提供的修正后的估计数字，上述６国的原油储量在过去５年中增加了３０８０亿桶，达到６９９０亿桶。６国的储量依次为：沙特，２５５０亿桶；伊拉克，１０００亿桶；阿联酋，９８０亿桶；科威特，９５０亿桶；伊朗，９３０亿桶；委内瑞拉，５８０亿桶。
    这些数字表明，海湾地区是世界上石油资源最丰富的地区。
    仅上述５个海湾国家的原油储量就占全世界总储量的近２／３。
    新华社北京１月１７日电　据埃及《金字塔经济学家》周刊最近报道，阿拉伯国家的对外贸易在这些国家经济中具有重要地位。
    报道说，阿拉伯国家的商品出口额，１９７０年约１３０亿美元，１９８０年增至２３４０亿美元，１９８６年降至约８５０亿美元；进口额，１９７０年约８８亿美元，１９８０年约１１６０亿美元，１９８７年降至９３６亿美元。
