	Entrepreneur Cao Qingjiang Turns Risk into Opportunity, Transforms Losing Enterprise into Profitable One

	According to Xinhua News Agency (Science and Technology Daily reporter Peng Hengcai, Xinhua News Agency reporter Wang Zuoli), a year ago, at the bidding meeting for the takeover of this company, Cao Qingjiang, the manager of the Supply and Marketing Cooperative of Zhong District, Jinning City, Shandong Province, made a bold statement by promising to achieve a profit of 960,000 yuan in three years, which defeated all competitors and won the bid. This statement was met with ridicule from some people.

	One year later, it is Cao Qingjiang who is laughing. At the beginning of last year, Cao Qingjiang used 20,000 yuan in cash and a personal residence worth 65,000 yuan as collateral to take over the Supply and Marketing Cooperative of the former Economic Commission of Zhong District, Jinning City. As a result, two months later, he achieved a business volume of 2 million yuan and a profit of over 100,000 yuan. By March, he achieved a profit of 200,000 yuan, and in the first quarter, he miraculously completed the annual profit target for the three-year contract period. In the past year, he exceeded the profit target for the three-year contract period, and the profit figure shown in the accounts is 1,050,000 yuan.

	Cao Qingjiang took over a company that had been in debt for many years. What is his secret to success?

	Running a company is all about making money, Cao Qingjiang does not just chase profits, but rather expands operations and enhances reputation through service and concessions, making money even when incurring losses. The Jinning Bed Sheet Factory was worried about a batch of export products due to a shortage of 2 pounds of dye affecting the printing and dyeing process. After learning this information, he immediately dispatched 12 purchasing staff to travel through dozens of cities to purchase the dye, finally obtaining the goods in Tianjin, which allowed the factory to complete a $200,000 export contract on time. Although they lost 2,000 yuan for these 2 pounds of dye, they gained reputation, and afterwards, all the raw materials needed by this factory were purchased from his company.

	Cao Qingjiang focuses on expanding a broad market by serving township enterprises, improving efficiency through expanded operations. Last year, his company established supply-demand relationships with over 80 township enterprises, business relationships with more than 20 material supply stations in other provinces, and conducted information exchanges with more than 50 peer companies. He ensures that township enterprises get whatever materials they need, continuously consolidating and expanding the company's operational territory.

　　企业家曹庆江抵押承包化险为夷  过去企业连年亏损现在创利百万
    据新华社电（科技日报记者彭亨才、新华社记者王作礼）山东省济宁市中区供销公司经理曹庆江一年前在招标承包这个公司的答辩会上，当口出“狂言”以３年实现利润９６万元的数额击败所有竞争者而中标的时候，曾引发出某些人的讥笑。
    一年后的今天，轮到曹庆江笑了。去年年初，曹庆江用现金２万元和一栋６．５万元的个人住房，风险抵押承包了济宁市中区原经委供销公司。结果两月后实现经营额２００万元，创利润１０多万元，到３月实现利润２０万元，第一季度竟奇迹般地完成了全年的承包创利指标。在过去的一年里，他超额完成了承包期３年的利润指标，帐簿上显示的创利数字是１０５万元。
    曹庆江承包的是一个连年负债累累的企业。他的经营诀窍是什么？
    办公司就是要赚钱，曹庆江不是见钱死赚，而是在企业服务与让利中扩大经营、提高信誉，在赔钱中赚钱。济宁市床单厂为缺２斤染料影响一批外销产品的印染而发愁。他得知这个信息后，立即派出１２个购销员，跑遍几十个城市去采购，最后在天津进到了货，使这个厂按期完成２００万美元的出口交货合同。为这２斤染料他们虽然亏本２０００元，却博得了信誉，以后这个厂所需的全部原材物料都从该公司进货。
    曹庆江注重在服务于乡镇企业中开辟广泛的经营市场，在扩大经营中提高效益。去年他的公司与８０多家乡镇企业建立了供求业务关系，与２０多家外省物资供应站建立了业务关系，与５０多家同行公司开展信息交流。做到乡镇企业需要什么，就采购供应什么货物，不断巩固和扩展本公司的经营天地。
