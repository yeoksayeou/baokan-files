The 41st International Education Conference, themed "Policies and Strategies for Post-Secondary Education," concluded on January 17 in Geneva. The conference adopted a recommendation letter to the education ministers of various countries, encouraging governments to vigorously develop and improve post-secondary education.

Post-secondary education is the most vibrant sector in the field of education. At this conference, representatives from over 100 countries and regions affirmed the significant role of post-secondary education in promoting and accelerating the cultural, economic, scientific, and technological development of contemporary society. Many representatives believed that without high-quality and efficient post-secondary education, it is difficult to imagine a country being able to cultivate middle and high-level talents who can fully master and control modern technology and continuously adapt to the rapidly developing society.

Over the past decade, post-secondary education has seen rapid development. Statistics from UNESCO indicate that from 1975 to 1986, the number of students receiving post-secondary education worldwide increased by 18.4 million, with 4.5 million in developed countries and 13.9 million in developing countries.

Despite the active efforts of various governments to develop post-secondary technical and vocational education, both developed and developing countries face various problems and challenges to different degrees.

Firstly, there is a shortage of educational funds, equipment, and infrastructure. Most representatives from developing countries emphasized at the conference that their countries are facing severe economic difficulties, which will have a detrimental impact on the education system, especially post-secondary education. Developed countries also face the problem of tight educational budgets. Some representatives from developed countries believe that existing educational expenditures should be managed and utilized more effectively.

Secondly, there is a lack of qualified educators. Due to the dramatic increase in student numbers and the growing demand for higher education quality and diversity, many representatives mentioned the shortage of teachers and their inadequate preparation in science and teaching. Some developing countries only have the ability to cultivate high-level teachers locally and rely heavily on foreign training centers. The brain drain situation in developing countries is worsening. The higher remuneration offered by administrative and economic departments is also affecting the stability of the teaching workforce.

Thirdly, the post-secondary education system lacks flexibility. Many representatives pointed out that the post-secondary education system is unable to adapt to the changing socio-economic world. There is a disconnect between the rapid development of scientific knowledge and the ability of many post-secondary education institutions to incorporate these advancements into their curricula and plans.

How to solve the above problems and promote the development of post-secondary education became the main topic of heated discussion among the representatives. Many representatives believed that while strengthening traditional higher education, it is necessary to expand and increase vocational education and training provided by non-university institutions, enhance the diversification and vocationalization of teaching plans, and promote the development of post-secondary education and training.

Some education officials from participating countries expressed that their countries will appropriately increase public spending on post-secondary education. Participants believed that it is necessary to raise educational funds from multiple channels. Some representatives also proposed the idea of establishing special taxes or funds to support post-secondary education.

Many representatives also pointed out that in the future, it is necessary to more widely utilize computers, satellites, radio, television, and other modern scientific technologies, and through various forms such as enterprise internal training, correspondence education, and night schools, to enable more people to receive post-secondary education and training.

People believe that the successful conclusion of this conference will have a positive promoting effect on the development of post-secondary education. As UNESCO Director-General Federico Mayor stated at the opening ceremony, the future world needs high-quality human resources. By the year 2000, post-secondary education will see new and significant development.

### 发展中学后教育的问题与对策

　　发展中学后教育的问题与对策
    新华社记者  李锐锋
    以“中学后教育的政策和战略”为主题的第４１届国际教育会议１月１７日在日内瓦闭幕。大会通过了致各国教育部长的建议书，鼓励各国政府大力发展和改进中学后教育。
    中学后教育是教育领域中最富有活力的部门。在本届会议上，来自１００多个国家和地区的数百位代表对中学后教育在促进与加速当代社会文化、经济、科学和技术发展中所起的重要作用予以了充分的肯定。不少国家的代表认为，没有优质高效的中学后教育，很难设想一个国家可以培养出能充分掌握和驾驭现代科技、不断适应飞速发展社会的中高级人才。
    近１０多年来，中学后教育得到了迅速的发展。联合国教科文组织提供的统计数字表明，在１９７５至１９８６年期间，全世界接受中学后教育的学生人数增加了１８４０万，其中在发达国家增加了４５０万，发展中国家增加了１３９０万。
    尽管各国政府为发展中学后技术和职业教育作出了积极努力，但是无论在发达国家或在发展中国家，中学后教育都在不同程度上面临着各种问题和困难。
    首先，教育资金有限，设备短缺、基础设施不足。大多数发展中国家的代表在会上强调，他们的国家正面临着严峻的经济困难。这将对教育体系特别是中学后教育产生有害的影响。发达国家也同样存在着教育经费紧张的问题。一些发达国家的代表认为，应更有效地管理和使用现有的教育开支。
    其次，缺乏合格的教育工作者。由于学生人数剧增、寻求提高教育质量和教育的多样化等一系列对教师的需求量更大了。许多代表提到了教师缺乏及教师在科学和教学方面准备不足的问题。一些发展中国家只具备就地培养高水平教师的能力，而在很大程度上依赖外国的培训中心。“人才外流”的情况在发展中国家仍在恶化。行政部门和经济部门较高报酬的吸引也在影响着教师队伍的稳定。
    第三，中学后教育体制缺乏灵活性。许多代表指出，中学后教育体制难以适应变化中的社会经济世界。科学知识迅速发展与许多中学后教育机构将这些进步列入其课程和计划的能力两者之间脱节。
    如何解决上述问题，促进中学后教育的发展，成了与会代表热烈讨论的主要话题。许多代表认为，应在加强传统的高等教育同时扩大和增加非大学机构所提供的职业教育和培训，加强教学计划的多样化和职业化，促进中学后教育和培训的发展。
    与会国家一些主管教育的官员表示，他们的国家将适当增加用于中学后教育的公共开支。与会者认为，有必要从多渠道筹措教育资金。一些代表还提出了设立特种税收或特别基金的设想，以资助中学后教育。
    不少国家的代表还指出，今后应更广泛地利用电脑、卫星、广播电视等现代科学技术，通过企业内部培训，函授教育、夜校等多种形式，让更多的人接受中学后教育和培训。
    人们认为，此次会议的胜利闭幕将对发展中学后教育起到积极的促进作用。正如联合国教科文组织总干事马约尔在大会开幕式上所说，未来世界需要高质量的人材资源。在２０００年前后，中学后教育将出现新的较大发展。
