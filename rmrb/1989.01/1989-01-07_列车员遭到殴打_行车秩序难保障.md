From January to October 1988, our bureau's passenger segment experienced 71 incidents where train staff were assaulted, resulting in 93 injuries, including 17 severe injuries.

On May 27, we witnessed an incident on the 253rd train from Guangzhou to Chengdu. Several individuals boarded the train without tickets and entered the sleeper car. When the train staff requested them to purchase tickets, they replied, "If we have to buy tickets, we should buy both the train ticket and the sleeper ticket; otherwise, we won't buy the train ticket." Consequently, they assaulted train staff member Guan Yàxīn, injuring his head. On June 13, a worker surnamed Zhou was fined for boarding a train without a ticket at Changfeng Station in Hunan. Holding a grudge, he gathered over 30 workers on June 15. Armed with hoes and pitchforks, they boarded the 511th train to seek revenge. In car number 8, they encountered train staff member Xiāo Guó'ān and struck him in the face with a hoe, causing him to bleed profusely. Subsequently, a few workers dragged Xiāo off the train, and one of them hit him on the head with a pitchfork, causing him to collapse. In this incident, 10 train staff members were injured, with 3 suffering severe injuries.

Train staff members work to serve passengers and need understanding and respect from passengers and society at large. They require support for their work and consideration for the difficulties and challenges they face.

We hope that relevant departments will severely punish the assailants and take effective measures to ensure the normal order on trains.

　　列车员遭到殴打
    行车秩序难保障
    １９８８年１月至１０月，我局客运段共发生７１起乘务员挨打事件，有９３人被打伤，其中重伤１７人。
    ５月２７日，我们在广州至成都的２５３次列车上亲眼见到，七八个人从广州无票上车后窜进卧铺车厢，列车员请他们补票，这伙人却说：“要补票须连卧铺票一起补，否则不补车票。”结果，他们将列车员关亚新的头部打伤。６月１３日，一个姓周的民工在湖南长丰车站因无票乘车被罚补了车票，他怀恨在心。６月１５日，当５１１次列车到达长丰车站时，他纠集了３０多名民工，手持扁担、钉耙等凶器，冲上列车报复行凶。在８号车厢，他们见到列车员肖国安，一扁担捅在肖的脸上，顿时鲜血直流。接着，几个民工又把肖国安拖下车去，一民工上前照肖国安头上就是一钉耙，肖当即昏倒在地。在这次事件中，有１０名乘务员被打伤，其中重伤３人。
    列车工作人员是为乘客服务的，他们也需要旅客乃至全社会的理解和尊重，支持他们的工作，体谅他们的工作难度和苦衷。
    希望有关部门严惩打人凶手，并采取有效措施，保证列车正常秩序。
