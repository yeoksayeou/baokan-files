Just returned from Shenzhen, where he had been negotiating business with Hong Kong merchants, Sun Siming was encountered by us. After talking for less than 5 minutes, he opened a thick pile of materials on his desk and said, "We are considering building a pig farm. This is the pig farming information just sent to me by Denmark, where pig farming is highly developed." After talking for only a couple more minutes, someone came in to report, "The sample of American canned pork has arrived by mail." Sun Siming took the four cans with red labels and said, "Send a telegram to the American client, expressing my thanks."

An atmosphere began to infect us: the small office located in the southeastern suburbs of Jiamusi City is connected to the outside world!

Indeed, Sun Siming now maintains contact with dozens of canned food factories in more than ten countries and regions around the world. He is the director of Jiamusi Meat Processing Plant, and he confidently says, "My reference system is these peers from developed countries!"

The words are said with such confidence. But what about three years ago?

At that time, Jiamusi Meat Processing Plant was like a lost child. Due to the shortage of pigs, the main business of slaughtering pigs could no longer sustain the factory. There was a canned food workshop, but it was always operating at a loss—where was the factory heading?

It was against this backdrop that in March 1985, Sun Siming, then 45 years old, was transferred to become the director. He studied mechanical manufacturing in college, which had nothing to do with meat processing, but he understood management, especially books on enterprise management from developed countries, which seemed to lead him to the seaside time and time again, greatly broadening his horizons.

He conducted a survey at the canned food workshop and, after calculating a few accounts, said that making canned food does not result in a loss; the loss was due to poor management and low labor productivity.

People did not believe him. Sun Siming then formulated new operational procedures and implemented a distribution principle linking wages to production and quality. As a result, without changing the equipment or increasing the workforce, the production of canned food per shift increased from 0.7 tons to 5 tons, 8 tons, 9 tons, and even 15 tons.

Everyone opened their eyes. That year, Sun Siming took on the task of producing 700 tons of export-quality steamed pork canned food. Initially, some people were worried about not completing the task, saying that they had never done so much before. However, by the end of the year, the actual production was 971 tons. At the end of the year, there were accounts to settle, and not only was there no loss, but there was also a profit of 600,000 yuan.

The factory's direction became clear: focus on the production of meat canned food. However, at that time, some meat canned food factories in the country were not doing well, and Sun Siming turned his gaze overseas. He saw that the international market had such a rich variety of meat canned food! He envied it and was plotting. He saw a piece of American information stating that using tin to seal food cans can easily contaminate the food, which is harmful to the human body, and it should be replaced with "high-frequency resistance welding." He knew this was the direction of development and immediately decided to introduce this new technology.

In May 1986, this descendant of a farmer first crossed the ocean and set foot on Italian and Swiss soil. He opened his eyes wide, greedily observing the canned food factories of his peers and the various canned food products on the store shelves... The prosperous world before his eyes made his thoughts enlightened and elevated. "They have already developed to this extent, we need to catch up, to pursue!" He eagerly sighed to his fellow travelers.

Now, the first "high-frequency resistance welding" production line in Heilongjiang Province is running smoothly at "Jialian," and computer management has extended to various parts of the factory.

Increased production, improved quality, and increased export share have made "Jialian" a "new star" in the domestic canned food industry. However, Sun Siming is "not impressed," and his mind is surging with thoughts. He knows that compared to foreign peers, the gap is not small. In August 1987, he visited again, spending 12 days in the Federal Republic of Germany and Denmark, visiting 23 canned food factories without stopping. Reflecting on that trip abroad, he said, "Compared to them, our foundation is weak, and it is impossible to catch up with developed countries in one step, but in terms of concepts, we must catch up in one step and strengthen management and continuously pursue new technologies."

He introduced Western-style ham production lines and sausage production lines from these two countries. In July 1988, the equipment arrived at the factory, and by September, qualified products were produced. "The international market changes quickly, and if we don't hurry, we will miss the opportunity." Sun Siming told us that currently, more than 300 tons of Western-style ham canned food and more than 50 tons of sausage canned food are being shipped to the Soviet Union. We tasted these two new products and unanimously praised the "good taste." Sun Siming proudly said, "We have compared our products with similar foreign products and not only are they not inferior, but in some aspects, they have even surpassed them."

Just as we were chatting, a report was placed in front of the director, and the topic turned to the numbers on the report. Sun Siming introduced that the factory's daily production, cost, and profit are calculated on the same day. If there is a problem, such as low production or high cost, it can be discovered immediately, and measures can be taken to solve it. He also said that now, from cadres to workers, after a day's work, whether they have earned or lost, and how much they have earned after deducting costs, everyone knows clearly.

Management has been strengthened, and efficiency has also improved. In 1986, "Jialian" produced 3,000 tons of canned food and made a profit of 1.06 million yuan. By 1988, more than 6,000 tons of canned food had been produced, and the profit exceeded 4 million yuan. The export earnings in 1986 were 2.8 million US dollars, and by 1988, it had reached 8 million US dollars.

Sun Siming is very busy. Two Japanese businessmen traveled thousands of miles to discuss the development of mushroom canned food with him. We bid him farewell, and he said that the door to the country has been opened, and his goal is to occupy a position among the world's peers...

We said goodbye to Sun Siming, but in the following days, the image of Sun Siming standing by the vast sea kept appearing before our eyes.

　　大海边，站着个孙世明
    新华社记者  张持坚  通讯员  徐国春
    刚从深圳和港商洽谈业务回来的孙世明，被我们撞上了。交谈不到５分钟，他翻开办公桌上厚厚的一摞材料说：“我们在考虑建个养猪场，这是养猪业很发达的丹麦刚刚给我寄来的养猪资料。”又谈了不过三两分钟，有人进来报告：“你要的美国猪肉罐头样品邮来了。”孙世明接过４个贴着红色商标的罐头，说道：“给美国客商发个电报，代我表示感谢。”
    一种气氛不由感染了我们：坐落在佳木斯市东南郊的这间不大的办公室，和外面的世界相连！
    是的，孙世明现在和世界上十几个国家和地区的几十家罐头食品厂保持着联系。他是佳木斯肉类联合加工厂厂长，他气度不凡地说：“我的参照系，就是这些发达国家的同行！”
    话说得有多硬气。可倒退三年呢？
    那时的佳木斯肉类联合加工厂，就像个迷路的孩子，由于猪少，主要靠杀猪过日子已经过不下去了，有个罐头车间，可一直赔钱——工厂向何处去？
    就在这样的背景下，１９８５年３月，４５岁的孙世明调来当厂长了。他在大学学的是机械制造，和肉类加工不沾边，但他懂管理，尤其是一本本发达国家企业管理的书籍，好像一次次把他领到了大海边，视野，极大地开阔了。
    他到罐头车间作调查，算了几笔帐后说，做罐头不赔钱，赔钱是因为管理没跟上，劳动生产率太低。
    人们不信。孙世明就制定新的工艺操作流程，实行工资和产量、质量挂钩的分配原则。结果，设备没变人没增，每班生产罐头由０．７吨逐渐上升到５吨、８吨、９吨，以至１５吨。
    大伙开了眼界。那年，孙世明接了生产７００吨出口清蒸猪肉罐头的任务。起初有人担心完不成，说从来没干过这么多。可到年底，实际生产了９７１吨，年末有帐可算了，不仅没亏，还盈利６０万元。
    工厂的方向明确了，以生产肉类罐头为主。可是，国内当时一些肉类罐头厂不太景气，孙世明把眼光伸向国外。他看到的是，国际市场上肉类罐头有多丰富！他眼红，他在思谋。他看到一份美国资料，说用锡焊接食品罐头容易污染食品，对人体有害，要代之以“高频电阻焊”。他知道这是发展方向，立即拍板，引进这项新技术。
    １９８６年５月，这位农民的后代，第一次飘洋过海，踏上了意大利和瑞士的国土。他睁大眼睛，贪婪地观看同行业厂家，看商店货架上那琳琅满目的各式罐头食品……眼前这个繁华的世界，使他的思想在开化，在升华。“人家已经发展到这个模样了，我们要追，要赶！”他焦急地向同行的伙伴感叹。
    如今，黑龙江省第一条“高频电阻焊”生产线，已在“佳联”欢快地运转着，微机管理也延伸到工厂的各个部位。
    产量增加，质量提高，出口比重加大，使“佳联”成为国内罐头行业的“新秀”。然而，孙世明“不以为然”，他胸中思涌如涛。他知道，与国外同行相比，差距不小。１９８７年８月，他再度出访，在联邦德国和丹麦活动１２天，马不停蹄地看了２３家罐头厂。回想那次出国，他说：“相比较，我们基础差，想一步赶上发达国家不可能，但是观念上必须一步到位、强化管理和不断追求新技术。”
    他从这两个国家引进了西式火腿生产线和对肠生产线。１９８８年７月设备到厂，９月便生产出合格产品。“国际市场变化快，不抓紧就会失去机遇。”孙世明告诉我们，目前３００多吨西式火腿罐头和５０多吨对肠罐头正源源运往苏联。我们品尝了这两样新产品，一致称道“味道好”。孙世明不无自豪地说：“我们已与国外同类产品作了比较，不仅不差，某些方面还超过了他们。”
    正聊着，一份报表送到了厂长面前，话题便转到了表上的数字。孙世明介绍说，工厂当天的产量、成本和利润，当天就计算出来，哪儿出了问题，或产量低了，或成本高了，马上就能发现，采取措施解决。他还说，现在从干部到工人，一天干下来，是挣了还是赔了，扣去成本能挣多少，人人心里都清楚。
    管理强化了，效率也就提高了。１９８６年“佳联”生产罐头３０００吨，盈利１０６万元。１９８８年已生产罐头６０００多吨，盈利超过４００万元。出口创汇额１９８６年为２８０万美元，１９８８年已达到８００万美元。
    孙世明很忙，两位日本客商千里迢迢赶来，正等着和他洽谈开发蘑菇罐头的事宜。我们向他告辞，他说，国门已经打开，他的目标是要在世界同行中占一个位置……
    我们告别了孙世明，但连日来，眼前不时浮现出孙世明站在辽阔的大海边……
