The era still needs essays

    What a strange phenomenon! In the 1980s, China's literary scene suddenly saw a flourishing of essays. Not only did every newspaper and magazine have essays, but there were even specialized publications and newspapers dedicated to them. Some provincial leaders even advocated for essays. What a remarkable sight! The rise of essays is indeed something to ponder, and perhaps it is even more a reflection of the times we live in.

    This is a peculiar era, filled with both hope and contradictions, progress and regression, justice and evil, order and chaos, joy and tears, praise and curses, solemn work and absurd nonsense all jumbled together. It is an era of great transformation filled with hope. New things emerge constantly, but their growth is difficult; old things are on the verge of disappearing, but they struggle to survive. Many doctrines once considered sacrosanct have lost their authority, and many ideas once deemed unchangeable have become laughable talismans. Idols once worshipped by people have suddenly crumbled, and heretical ideas once feared as monsters have suddenly become popular, turning into policies implemented across China, achieving unexpected good results, and rescuing people from the brink of disaster. Many ordinary people, once trampled underfoot and struggling to make ends meet, have suddenly stood up, dressed in suits, and confidently entered luxurious hotels and taken the stage to command attention. Some people are cheering, some are rejoicing, some are breaking through barriers, while others are resisting, sighing, and cursing.

    In such an era, everything is colorful and changing rapidly. In the fast-paced life, people do not have the patience to wait for carefully crafted historical epics, nor are they satisfied with profound long-winded arguments. People need praise, need to shout, need to vent, need daggers and spears to point directly at all the decaying systems, thoughts, cultures, morals, customs, and various forms of spiritual garbage that hinder historical progress. Thus, the era needs essays that adapt to reality.

    Essays are a unique genre, and essay writers possess unique qualities. Because of this, during authoritarian times, essays were doomed to decline, and essay writers were destined to suffer. Even in this era of thought liberation and flourishing essays, essay writers, as those who brave the wind and rain, hack through thorns, are destined to live in storms and find their way through thorns. Their fate is not as easy and pleasant as sitting in a salon writing songs of praise. They may be struck by storms or fall in the thicket of thorns. They will face attacks from those who see essays as a thorn in their side, but this is nothing; the discomfort of these people is the glory of essays. However, sometimes when essays clear the way for new systems and new ideas, they may comment on the imperfections of new policies, or the writer, in using this sharp weapon, may occasionally slip, offending new policies. Therefore, essays being criticized as "one-sided" and "extreme" is common. As for occasionally touching a sore spot, or being targeted by those who feel offended, mobilizing forces to attack, leading to "court battles," or even "being taken to the authorities," this is also possible. However, I think that essay writers with boiling blood in their veins, who have decided to use their pens as swords and their blood as ink, to clear the way for bright things, and to be the cleaners of spiritual garbage, should have the resolve to "sacrifice my head for essays." But I also think that the times have changed, and the decision-makers implementing new policies are enlightened and far-sighted. A wise commander knows the value of his soldiers who charge through smoke and gunfire, and can forgive them if they occasionally make mistakes and injure their comrades. Moreover, the personal rights of writers and creative freedom have been written into the constitution. If any authority still tries to summon winds and rains, or use some magical artifacts to display past skills, it would be quite inappropriate.

    Of course, as an essay writer, one should have an immense love for the socialist cause of the motherland, deeply detest the forces obstructing reform, have a clear understanding of principles, distinguish clearly between friends and enemies, and write in a manner that seeks truth from facts, without reckless satire, cold mockery, or vulgar abuse, so that readers do not feel that everything in the world is worthless and hopeless. This requires what Lu Xun said, "goodwill" and "passion" when writing essays. Essays that criticize social ills should take typical examples, not making a point of naming names or implying. The writer has intentions, the reader has interest, and the person involved can take heed, that is enough.

    Essays shout for new systems and new things, criticize social ills without mercy, and can play the role of a political cleaner. But I think since essays are a genre of literature, they should win readers in artistic appreciation. Therefore, essays must strive for depth in thought and perfection in art, making each essay like a string of pearls, shining with exquisite artistic luster. Otherwise, essays will be difficult to pass down. At present, when essays are flourishing, it is time to propose efforts to improve the artistic quality of essays.

    Essays seem scattered at first glance, covering ancient and modern, north and south, national affairs, trivial matters, social trends, right and wrong, the smallest details, and the falling of a leaf, nothing is beyond discussion. In reality, essays are scattered yet not scattered. Essay writers always pick typical examples from the myriad of social phenomena, seeing great principles in trivial matters, and knowing right from wrong in praise and criticism. Criticizing social ills should be merciless, but should be true to the facts and sincere to people, with a mind of tolerance, without harming the greater good. This is a good essay. There are also those essays that are vague, beating around the bush, scratching an itch from outside the shoe, not hitting the sore spot, not saying what is right, merely saying "Today's weather, haha...", not daring to mention the obvious problems in reality, only giving people the impression of covering up the truth. Such essays are scattered but not substantial, not good essays. Of course, praising a prosperous age is natural, but that is another genre and cannot be called essays with their special meaning in a specific era.

    Currently, some essays like to use ancient examples to prove modern points, using extensive references, seemingly with great effort, often implying something while writing cautiously, letting readers guess the answer. This is not necessarily bad, and oblique writing is also a genre of essays, but I think it is better to face the harsh realities of life directly, take typical examples, and express one's thoughts frankly. Someone might say, "Brother, you dare to face reality, dare to hit hard targets, brave indeed, but alas, you end up with a bruised nose and face, to no avail! How can it compare to my talking about the past and present, pointing at the mulberry tree while cursing the osier, laughing, scolding, all becoming articles?" I respectfully acknowledge your teaching. However, I cannot help but feel a bit sad, is frank speech not allowed in prosperous times? I still prefer to continue writing my essays under the title "Dangerous Words in Prosperous Times," even if it means paying the price of a bruised nose and face, it is not a concern.

　　时代还需要杂文
    马识途
    奇哉怪哉，在八十年代的中国文坛突然出现杂文鼎盛的局面。不仅无报无杂文，无刊无杂文，而且有专门的刊物和报纸。且有某些省委领导提倡杂文之说。咿吁乎盛哉，杂文之兴起也！
    这是一个值得思考的现象，当然，恐怕由于这更是一个值得思考的时代。
    这是一个奇异的时代，一个充满着希望与矛盾，前进与倒退，正义与邪恶，秩序与混乱，欢乐与眼泪，歌颂与咒骂，庄严工作与胡涂荒谬杂然分陈的时代。这是一个充满着希望的大转变的时代。新事物层出不穷，然而生长艰难；旧事物趋于消灭，然而垂死挣扎。许多过去认为天经地义的教条，失去了权威的光彩，许多视为不可更改的观念，变成了可笑的符咒。一些被人们五体投地、顶礼膜拜的偶像突然坍塌下来，一些多年视为洪水猛兽的异端邪说，突然时兴起来，并被化为政策，在中国大地上实行起来，而且取得意外的好效果，把人民从水火之中拔于衽席之上。许多被踩在脚下的衣食不周的凡夫俗子，突然抬起头来，西装革履，昂然走进豪华的酒店，登上呼风唤雨的指挥台。一些人在欢呼，一些人在得意，一些人在突破，一些人却在抵抗，在叹息，在咒骂。
    这样的时代，五光十色，瞬息万变，在生活的快节奏中，人们不耐烦等待精心刻划历史的鸿篇巨制，也不满足于道理深奥的长篇大论。人们需要赞颂，需要呐喊，需要发泄，需要匕首和投枪，直指那些阻碍历史前进的一切腐朽的体制、思想、文化、道德、习俗以及形形色色的精神垃圾。于是时代需要和现实相适应的杂文。
    杂文是一种特殊的文体，杂文作者具有特殊的品格。正因为这样，在那专制的年月里，杂文是注定要衰落的，杂文作者是注定要受难的。就是在这思想解放、杂文勃兴的时代，杂文作者既然是顶风冒雨的人，披荆斩棘的人，便注定要在风雨里讨生活，在荆棘中寻路前行。他们的命运决不如坐在沙龙里写赞歌那么轻松愉快，而可能受到风暴的袭击，可能在荆棘丛中仆倒。他们将受到视杂文为眼中钉的人们的攻击，这倒没有什么，这些人的不舒服正是杂文的荣耀。但是有时由于杂文在为新体制新思想扫清道路的时候，有时对于新政的不完备之处进行评说，或者作者在使用这锋利武器的时候疏于把握，偶尔失手，误忤新政，也是有的。因此杂文被斥为“片面”、“偏激”是常有的事。至于偶触逆鳞，或被忌讳者自动“对号入座”，兴师动众，打上门来，以致“对簿公庭”，甚至“捉将官里去”，也并非没有可能。然而我想，血管里流着沸腾的血的杂文作者，既然决心以笔作刀枪，以血作墨，为光明的事物鸣锣开道，做精神垃圾的清洁工，就该有不惜“我以我头祭杂文”的决心。不过我又想，时代不同了，执行新政的决策者们是开明的，有远见的。一个聪明的指挥员，知道自己那些在硝烟弹雨中冲锋陷阵的战士的可贵和他们偶然失手、误伤战友的可以原谅。而且作家的人身权利和创作自由已经写进了宪法，如有什么权威还想呼风唤雨，祭起什么法宝，施展过去的身手，也颇不合时宜了。
    当然，作为一个杂文作者应该对祖国的社会主义事业无比热爱，对阻碍改革的势力深恶痛绝，对事理有清醒的理解，敌友界限泾渭分明，行文务求实事求是，不乱讽刺，也不宜冷嘲，更不可谩骂，不致使读者觉得一切世事一无足取，一无可为。这就需要鲁迅说的写杂文时的“善意”和“热情”。杂文针砭时弊应取典型，不以点名或影射为能事。作者有心，读者有味，当事者可得鉴戒足矣。
    杂文为新体制新事物呐喊，针砭时弊不留情面，在政治上能起清道夫的作用。但我想杂文既然是文学的一个品种，它应该在艺术欣赏上赢得读者，因此杂文必须在思想上力求有深度，在艺术上力求精益求精，使一篇篇杂文都如珠串，闪出玲珑剔透的艺术光辉。不如此，杂文便难以传之久远。当前正当杂文鼎盛之际，提出努力提高杂文的艺术质量，应该是时候了。
    杂文初看起来是杂的，古今上下，天南地北，经国大业，茶酒余事，世道人心，是非得失，青萍之末，一叶之落，无不可议，无不可谈。其实杂文是杂而不杂的。杂文作者总是从纷至沓来的社会现象中摘取典型，于微末中见大义，于褒贬中知趋避。针砭时弊固应不留情面，但却应真以指事，诚以对人，心存汉阙，无伤大雅。这便是好杂文。也有那种吞吞吐吐，转弯抹角，隔靴搔痒，刺不到痛处，说不到是处的杂文，无非“今天天气哈哈哈……”，不敢言及现实中有目共瞩的弊端，徒然给人以粉饰太平的印象。这种杂文杂则杂矣，文则不足，不算好的杂文。当然，歌颂盛世自然是应该的，但那是另外一种文体，不能再叫在特定时代有特殊涵义的杂文了。
    目前有些杂文颇喜以古证今、以旁征博引为能事，揣摩起来，其用心甚苦，多是事有所指而笔有所忌，只好这么含糊其辞，让读者去寻谜底。这固然没有什么不好，而且曲笔也是杂文中的一种文体，但我以为终不如直面惨淡的人生，取其类型，直抒胸臆为好。或有人曰：“老兄敢直面人生，敢碰硬头钉子，勇则勇矣，无奈碰得鼻青脸肿，于事无补何？怎及我说古道今，指桑骂槐，喜笑怒骂，皆成文章的好？”我再拜曰：“敬领明教。”然而我却难免有几分悲哀，危言竟不容于盛世乎！我却还是宁愿以《盛世危言》的题目继续写我的杂文，即使要付出鼻青脸肿的代价，非所计也。
