The China Basic Construction Optimization Research Association adheres to the principles of "democracy, grassroots, and self-management," uniting a broad range of technological personnel, leveraging their strengths, and providing strategic advice for the optimization of basic construction in our country, making significant contributions.

Basic construction optimization is an emerging interdisciplinary field. Since its establishment in 1978, the association has held nine academic exchange conferences. It has proposed many constructive opinions and methods on how to improve the investment benefits of basic construction in our country and reduce blind and erroneous practices, attracting the attention of relevant national departments. The association has organized its members to compile over 50 books, including "Basic Construction Economics and Management," "Thought Behavior and Management," and "Feasibility Study of Basic Construction Projects." It has also published 51 issues of the "Basic Construction Optimization" magazine, which has been distributed both domestically and internationally. Many of these books have been adopted as textbooks or reference materials by colleges and universities and basic construction departments. The China Basic Construction Optimization Consulting Company, affiliated with the association, collaborates with more than 30 design institutes, construction units, and colleges and universities nationwide to carry out consulting activities, directly serving the national economy with good results. For example, the company provided consulting and overall planning for the widening and reconstruction of South Street in Xi'an, which was adopted by the city. Since the company's establishment in 1980, it has accepted over 200 engineering consulting projects. The construction investment of the completed consulting projects, compared to the original design estimate, has saved 5% to 15% of the investment, achieving good results. In recent years, the association has also trained over 300 economic management cadres for hundreds of enterprises nationwide.

　　团结科技人员　发挥自身优势
    基建优化研究会开展社会服务
    本报讯  记者马在新报道：中国基本建设优化研究会坚持“民主、民间、民办”的原则，团结广大科技人员，发挥自身优势，为我国基建优化事业出谋划策，做出了贡献。
    基建优化学是一门新兴交叉学科。该会自１９７８年成立以来，９次召开学术交流会，对如何提高我国基建投资效益、减少盲目与失误提出了许多建设性意见和办法，引起国家有关部门的关注。该会组织会员编著了《基建经济与管理》、《思想行为与管理》、《基建项目可行性研究》等书籍５０余种，出版《基建优化》杂志５１期向国内外发行。许多书籍还被大专院校和基建部门列为教材或参考书。该会所属的中国基建优化咨询公司与全国３０多个设计院、施工单位、大专院校合作，开展咨询活动，直接为国民经济服务，效果良好。如西安市南大街拓宽改造规划设计，该公司提供了咨询及整体规划，被该市采纳。自１９８０年公司成立以来，已接受工程咨询项目２００多个，已完成的咨询项目的建设投资与原设计概算相比，节约投资５％至１５％，取得较好效益。几年来，该会还为全国数百个企业培养经济管理干部３００多人。
