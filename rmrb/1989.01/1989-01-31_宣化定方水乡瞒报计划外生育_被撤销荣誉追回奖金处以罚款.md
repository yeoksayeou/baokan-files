The township of Dingfang in Xuanhua County, Hebei Province, concealed out-of-plan births and was stripped of its honors, had its awards revoked, and was fined.

According to a report, Dingfang Township reported in 1987 that there were no out-of-plan births, for which it was awarded the title of an advanced unit by the city and received a prize of 300 yuan. In March 1988, following a tip from the public, the county's Family Planning Commission verified that the township had concealed 14 cases of multiple births. In May, the city and county Family Planning Commissions discovered that the township continued to falsify records in the family planning work inspection, reporting one case of four births and two cases of three births as planned second births.

In accordance with the spirit of the provincial party committee and government's notice on "revoking honors for those who falsify records to obtain honors" and relevant regulations of the city and county, to maintain the seriousness of the Statistics Law, the Zhangjiakou City Family Planning Commission decided: to revoke the township's title of an advanced unit for having no out-of-plan births, to recover all the prize money, and to impose a fine of 900 yuan, with a notice sent to the entire city; to recommend that the Xuanhua County Discipline Inspection Commission and Supervision Bureau give disciplinary action to the relevant responsible parties.
