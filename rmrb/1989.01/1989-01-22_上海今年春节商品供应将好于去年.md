Shanghai's supply of food and daily-use industrial goods for this year's Spring Festival is abundant, with the total supply quantity better than last year.

The rationed portion of food supplies this Spring Festival has increased in quantity compared to last year. For non-rationed goods, most varieties are more plentiful than the same period last year. The daily market supply of vegetables is planned to be 200,000 kilograms before and after the festival, with a variety of types. The supply of aquatic products will reach 600,000 kilograms. The supply of fruits such as oranges, apples, and pears has increased by 6% compared to the same period last year. The total investment in industrial consumer goods for the festival market has increased by more than 10% compared to the same period last year. Out of 48 key daily-use industrial goods, 33 have increased in supply. The supply of clothing, hats, and shoes is abundant, and the supply of scarce large items has increased, while the supply of some cotton textiles is relatively tight.

The Shanghai Municipal Government and relevant departments have strengthened the management of market prices. The prices of rationed staple and auxiliary foods and some industrial goods necessary for people's daily lives will not be increased. Measures to control prices are being studied to ensure that the price increase this year is significantly lower than last year. Many commercial workers are also participating in quality service competitions to improve service quality and do a good job in the Spring Festival supply.

    上海今年春节商品供应将好于去年
    上海今年春节副食品和日用工业品货源充裕，总供应量都好于去年。
    今年春节供应的副食品定量部分数量比去年有增加；敞开商品，大多数品种都多于去年同期。蔬菜在节日前后每天上市量安排２００万公斤，品种较多。水产品的供应量将达６００万公斤。桔子、苹果、生梨等水果供应量比去年同期增长６％。节日市场工业消费品的投放总额比去年同期增长１０％以上。４８种重点日用工业品，有３３种供应量上升。服装鞋帽等货源充沛，紧俏大件商品投放量有增加，部分针棉织品供应偏紧。
    上海市人民政府和有关部门加强了对市场物价的管理，定量供应的主副食品和人民日常生活必需的一些工业品均不涨价，并正在研究价格监控措施，以确保今年物价上涨幅度明显低于去年。许多商业职工也在开展优质服务竞赛活动，提高服务质量，做好春节供应工作。
