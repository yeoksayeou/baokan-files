	The Executive Secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, Adedeji, recently announced in the Africa Hall in Addis Ababa that Africa's gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 2.5% in 1988, higher than the 1.3% growth in 1987. However, due to Africa's population growth rate of 3%, per capita income decreased by 4.2% last year.

	The main reasons for the economic improvement in 1988 were favorable weather conditions and rising prices of mineral products. Food production increased significantly in 1988, with a growth rate of 3.8%, reversing the 1.2% decline of the previous year.

	However, Africa's economy still faces many challenges. Prices for products such as oil, coffee, cocoa, and tea show no signs of recovery.

	Adedeji predicts that Africa's economic outlook for this year is not optimistic. If weather conditions are poor, international aid is insufficient, and the debt burden is not eased, economic growth will likely be lower than last year, and per capita GDP will continue to decline. If the international community can support the United Nations' African economic recovery plan this year and reduce the various conditions attached to aid, Africa's economy has the potential to grow by 4.5% to 5.5%.

　　去年非洲经济增幅较大    
    但因人口增长率高人均收入反而下降
    本报讯  联合国非洲经济委员会执行秘书阿德德吉不久前在亚的斯亚贝巴非洲大厦宣布，１９８８年非洲国内生产总值实际增长２．５％，高于１９８７年的１．３％。但由于非洲人口增长率为３％，因此去年人均收入下降了４．２％。
    １９８８年经济好转的主要原因是气候适宜和矿产品价格看涨。粮食生产在１９８８年有了明显增长，增长率为３．８％，扭转了前一年下降１．２％的局面。
    然而，非洲经济还面临诸多困难。石油、咖啡、可可、茶叶等产品价格回升无望。
    阿德德吉预计今年非洲经济前景不容乐观。如果气候条件恶劣、国际援助不力、债务负担得不到减轻，经济增长势必低于去年，人均国内生产总值仍会进一步下降。如果国际社会今年能设法支持联合国非洲经济复兴方案，减少提供援助的种种附带条件，今年非洲经济有可能增长４．５％至５．５％。
