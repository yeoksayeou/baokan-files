The exhibition hall protecting the No. 1 site of the Yaozhou Kiln, located at the site of an ancient famous green porcelain kiln, has begun to receive domestic and international visitors.

The Yaozhou Kiln, located near Tongchuan in Shaanxi Province, was fired during the Tang Dynasty and flourished during the Song Dynasty. It was one of the main production areas for green porcelain in northern China and had a widespread influence across the country.

Since 1959, Chinese archaeologists have conducted three large-scale scientific excavations of the Yaozhou Kiln site, covering an area of nearly 6,000 square meters. They have unearthed 37 ceramic workshops and 39 kilns from the Tang, Five Dynasties, Song, Jin, and Yuan dynasties, as well as approximately 400,000 pieces of ceramic artifacts, glazed building materials, workshop tools, and kiln tools from various periods. Among these, the Tang tri-color glazed pottery and Five Dynasties green porcelain have attracted academic attention.

Experts believe that this site is a rare porcelain kiln site in China, rich in content, well-preserved, with minimal human damage, and clear cultural layering relationships.

The Yaozhou Kiln Museum, built on the site, mainly displays ancient ceramic sites and porcelain specimens from China. The No. 1 site protection hall, which has been completed, began construction in early 1987. The hall has an exhibition area of 1,100 square meters and displays Song Dynasty ceramic workshops, Tang Dynasty kilns, Song Dynasty kilns, as well as drying yards and material storage areas. These sites systematically reproduce the entire process of Yaozhou green porcelain production and firing, reflecting the prosperous scene of ancient Chinese ceramic development.

　　开烧于唐盛于宋　青瓷名窑价值高
    耀州窑遗址建博物馆开门迎客
    新华社西安１月４日电  （记者王煌彦）设在我国古代著名青瓷窑场遗址上的耀州窑博物馆一号遗址保护大厅，日前开始接待国内外游客。
    位于陕西铜川附近的耀州窑，开烧于唐，兴盛于宋，是北方民间青瓷的主要产地之一，影响遍及全国。
    我国考古工作者自１９５９年以来，对耀州窑遗址进行了３次大规模的科学发掘，面积近６０００平方米，清理出唐、五代、宋、金、元等各个朝代的陶瓷作坊３７座，窑炉３９座，获得各个时期所烧造的陶瓷器、琉璃建材、作坊具、窑具约４０多万片，其中唐三彩和五代青瓷引起了学术界的关注。
    专家认为，这个遗址是我国古瓷窑遗址中内涵丰富、保存完整、人为破坏少，文化层叠压关系清楚的一个难得的瓷窑遗址。
    在遗址上建起的耀州窑博物馆，主要展出我国古陶瓷遗址和古瓷器标本。现已竣工的一号遗址保护大厅，是１９８７年初动工的。大厅陈列面积为１１００平方米，展出了宋代制瓷作坊、唐代烧瓷窑炉、宋代烧瓷窑炉以及晾坯场、堆料场等生产设施。这些遗址系统地再现了耀州青瓷制作和装烧的整个工艺流程，反映了我国古代瓷业发展的繁荣景象。
