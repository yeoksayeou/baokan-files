	Salvador's political situation has become more chaotic in the past three months. Out of the 362 municipal governments nationwide, 8 mayors have been killed by the guerrillas, and 54 mayors and 7 local judges have resigned and fled abroad under pressure from the guerrillas.

	Salvador held municipal elections in March last year. The far-right Nationalist Republican Alliance won 178 mayoral positions, while the ruling Christian Democratic Party only secured 79. The Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front, a guerrilla organization, believes that local civilian officials have become tools for the government's military to suppress the guerrillas. Therefore, they recently sent letters to many mayors, demanding they resign within 72 hours. Under the pressure from the guerrillas, many mayors panicked and resigned. Some openly announced their resignation to return to farming, while others fled abroad. One mayor, after receiving the guerrillas' letter, said, "I have a wife and children, so I have to resign. I wanted to continue serving, but I can't." Some local authorities have requested protection from the central government and even written to the U.S. government seeking support. Reports indicate that if this trend continues, by the time Salvador holds its general elections in March this year, 40% of the mayors nationwide will have resigned.

	Western diplomats believe that the wave of resignations among Salvador's mayors once again shows the failure of U.S. policy towards Salvador. In the past eight years, the U.S. has provided approximately $3 billion in military and economic aid to the pro-American military and political authorities in Salvador, but to no avail.

	In the domestic war, Salvador has already lost 70,000 people. The guerrillas have not only not been eliminated but are also expanding. While pressuring mayors to resign, the guerrillas have also intensified their military offensives. Reports indicate that on January 10, the guerrillas simultaneously attacked 10 towns and blew up some power facilities, causing 40% of the capital to lose power. On January 17, the guerrillas again simultaneously attacked 7 towns, killing 26 government soldiers. One of the five members of the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front's General Command, Roberto Rivas, recently said, "The balance of power between the guerrillas and the government army is shifting in favor of the guerrillas, and the guerrillas are entering the preparatory stage for a counteroffensive."

　　萨尔瓦多政局更趋混乱
    游击队频频发动攻势  地方官纷纷辞职外逃
    新华社墨西哥城１月１９日电（记者沈家松）最近３个月来，萨尔瓦多政局更趋混乱，全国３６２个市级地方政府中，已有８名市长被游击队打死，５４名市长和７名地方法官在游击队的压力下辞职外逃。
    萨尔瓦多去年３月举行市政选举，极右的民族主义共和联盟赢得了１７８个市长职位，执政的基督教民主党只获得了７９个市长职位。游击队组织法拉本多·马蒂民族解放阵线认为，地方文职官员已经成为政府军镇压游击队的走卒。因此，最近分别写信给许多市长，限定他们在７２小时内辞职。在游击队的压力下，许多市长惊慌失措，纷纷辞职。有的公开宣布弃官务农，有的外逃到外国。一位市长在接到游击队的信后说，“我有妻子儿女，所以只好辞职，我想继续当官，但当不成。”也有一些地方当局要求中央政府提供保护，甚至写信给美国政府请求支援。据报道，如果这种倾向继续下去，到今年３月萨尔瓦多预定举行大选之时，全国总计将有４０％的市长会辞去职务。
    西方外交官认为，萨尔瓦多市长辞职浪潮再次表明美国对萨尔瓦多政策的失败。最近８年来，美国已经给了亲美的萨尔瓦多军政当局总共约３０亿美元的军事、经济援助，但也无济于事。
    萨尔瓦多在国内战争中迄今已有７万人丧生。游击队不仅未被消灭，而且还有扩大的势头。
    游击队在逼迫市长辞职的同时，最近还加强了军事攻势。据报道，１月１０日，游击队同时袭击１０座城镇，并炸毁一些供电设施，使首都４０％的地区停电。１月１７日，游击队又同时袭击７座城镇，打死政府军官兵２６人。法拉本多·马蒂民族解放阵线总司令部５成员之一罗伯托·罗加最近说：“游击队和政府军之间的力量对比正在向有利于游击队的方向变化，游击队已进入反攻的准备阶段”。
