	Exploiting Job Transfer to Plunder Public Property Sparks Public Outrage
	Former Director of Gu Cheng Economic Commission, Zuo Ming Shun, Removed from Post
	All Illegally Obtained Assets Confiscated

	People's Daily, Wuhan, January 3rd — Reporter Gong Dafa reports: In Gu Cheng County, Hubei Province, former Director of the Economic Commission, Zuo Ming Shun, took advantage of his job transfer to embezzle public property and plunder public funds, sparking public outrage.

	Zuo Ming Shun transferred back to his hometown of Huangshi City in June 1988 through connections, taking up the position of Deputy Director of the Mechanical Industry Office of the City Economic Commission. "Job transfer" became Zuo Ming Shun's excuse for plundering public funds. From January to June of last year, he visited over 30 enterprises and institutions under the county's Economic Commission, using hints, coercion, and purchasing goods without payment to embezzle and occupy public property. The Hubei Provincial Supervision Bureau provided shocking figures: During his job transfer, Zuo embezzled public funds amounting to 1,454 yuan, extorted and occupied public property worth 3,997 yuan, and accepted gifts worth 1,909 yuan. His wife, who was formerly the Deputy Director of the Gu Cheng County Transportation Bureau, also took the opportunity to embezzle public property worth 1,557 yuan and accept gifts worth 777 yuan.

	The public reported that Zuo Ming Shun never left empty-handed from any visit. The white liquor produced by the county's wine factory, a provincial-level product, was taken by him three times in less than half a year, claiming it was for gifts during his job transfer; he called the county's toilet paper factory and demanded a box of toilet paper; when he bid farewell at the county's battery factory, he saw a nice coffee table and insisted on taking two; at the county's refractory materials factory, he took 500 blocks of honeycomb coal.

	Zuo Ming Shun also used fake receipts and personal purchases billed to the public to embezzle public funds. In February and June of last year, he obtained three fake receipts for purchasing wood ears, mushrooms, and cigarettes, falsely claiming to give gifts to higher-level agencies, and forced the factories under his jurisdiction to reimburse 561 yuan. The pastries and fabrics he used for his job transfer gifts were also billed to the factories. On June 30th of last year, he went to the furniture factory and "bought" two bedboards worth 112 yuan for 40 yuan, and later took the 40 yuan receipt to another factory for reimbursement.

	The public was extremely indignant about Zuo Ming Shun's embezzlement and occupation of public property, writing to the provincial, municipal, and county supervision agencies, demanding that he be dealt with according to party and administrative discipline. The Huangshi City Government recently decided to remove Zuo Ming Shun from his administrative post and confiscate all illegally obtained assets; Zuo Ming Shun's wife also received a major demerit in her administrative record.

　　趁调动工作之机搜刮民财引起民愤
    谷城原经委主任左明顺被撤职
    全部非法所得被没收
    本报武汉１月３日电  记者龚达发报道：湖北省谷城县原经委主任左明顺趁工作调动之机，大肆鲸吞公物、搜刮民财，在当地激起民愤。
    左明顺于１９８８年６月通过关系调回老家黄石市，任市经委机械工业办公室副主任。“调动工作”成了左明顺搜刮民财的借口。去年１至６月，他先后到县经委所属的３０多家企事业单位，采用暗示、强要和购物不付款等方式，大量索要和侵占公物。对此，湖北省监察厅提供的数字是惊人的：左在调动工作期间，贪污公款１４５４元，索要、侵占公物折款３９９７元，接受礼品折款１９０９元。其妻（原任谷城县交通局副局长）也乘机侵占公物１５５７元，收礼７７７元。
    群众检举说，左明顺每到一个单位决不空手而归，见啥要啥。县酒厂生产的白酒是省优产品，他在不到半年时间里三“下”酒厂，以调动工作需要送礼为由，要走白酒２００多瓶；他一个电话打到县卫生纸厂，一开口就要一箱卫生纸；他到县蓄电池厂“辞行”，看到办公室茶几不错，硬是要走两个；在县耐火材料厂便要了５００块蜂窝煤。
    左明顺还采取开假发票，私人购物在公家报销等手段贪污公款。去年２月和６月，他先后弄到３张填有购木耳、香菌、香烟的假发票，谎称给上级机关送礼，硬要所管辖的工厂报销５６１元。他联系工作调动送礼用的糕点、布料，也开发票到工厂报销。去年６月３０日，他到家具厂，用４０元“买”走了价值１１２元的两副床板，事后他又将这４０元的发票拿到另一家工厂报销了。
    对于左明顺的贪污、侵占公物行为，当地群众极为愤慨，投书省、市、县监察机关，要求依照党纪政纪处理。黄石市政府已于最近作出决定，撤销左明顺行政职务，追缴、没收全部非法所得财物；左明顺的妻子也受到行政记大过处分。
