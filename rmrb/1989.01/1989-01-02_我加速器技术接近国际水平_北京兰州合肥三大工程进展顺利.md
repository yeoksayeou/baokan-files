China's accelerator technology is approaching international standards, with the Beijing, Lanzhou, and Hefei projects progressing smoothly.

The Xinhua News Agency reported from Beijing on January 1 that Professor Xie Jialin, president of the Chinese Particle Accelerator Society, recently revealed that following the successful collision of the Beijing electron-positron collider, the Lanzhou heavy ion accelerator has also been completed, and the Hefei synchrotron radiation source is nearing completion. The smooth progress of these three major projects indicates that China's accelerator technology has approached international standards.

Xie Jialin said that in recent years, China's accelerator industry has developed rapidly. The collision brightness of the Beijing electron-positron collider has increased by nearly two orders of magnitude, the energy of the heavy ion beam of the Lanzhou heavy ion accelerator is continuously increasing, and the construction and installation work of the Hefei synchrotron radiation source are both nearing completion. These three projects have learned from advanced foreign technologies, relied on and combined domestic scientific and technological forces and industrial departments, and jointly overcome many key technologies. This has laid a good foundation for accelerators in China and given them international competitiveness. At the same time, it has trained and enriched a relatively mature team of accelerator technology experts. In the research and development of small accelerators, there has also been significant progress in China in recent years. According to incomplete statistics, there are nearly 170 small accelerators of various types in the country, and there are more than 160 ion implanters.

Newly developed accelerators include electron curtain accelerators, small power serial accelerators, heavy ion implanters, axial coupling standing wave acceleration tubes, and nine other types. Those currently under development include induction linear accelerators and industrial non-destructive testing electron linear accelerators.

In terms of application, more than 70 medical accelerators have been put into operation in the country; the industrial radiation application market is being developed, with Beijing, Shanghai, Southwest, Northwest, and Northeast all forming industrial radiation centers of a certain scale; the number of accelerators used for industrial non-destructive testing has increased to more than 10.

　　我加速器技术接近国际水平
    北京兰州合肥三大工程进展顺利
    新华社北京１月１日电  中国粒子加速器学会理事长谢家麟教授近日透露，继北京正负电子对撞机实现对撞之后，兰州重离子加速器也已建成，合肥同步辐射光源也临近完工。三大工程的顺利进展，标志着我国加速器技术已接近国际水平。
    谢家麟说，近几年我国加速器事业发展迅速。北京正负电子对撞机的对撞亮度又提高了近两个数量级，兰州重离子加速器的重离子束能量也在不断提高，合肥同步辐射光源土建和安装工作均已进入尾声。三大工程借鉴国外先进技术，立足并联合国内科技力量和产业部门，共同攻克了多项关键技术，使加速器的主要技术在国内有了较好的基础，在国际上有了竞争能力，同时锻炼和充实了一批较为成熟的加速器技术队伍。在小型加速器研制和应用上，国内近年来也有很大发展。据不完全统计，国内现有各类小型加速器近１７０台，另有１６０余部离子注入机。
    新研制成功的还有电子帘加速器、小功率串列加速器、重离子注入机、轴耦驻波加速管等，共有９种类型；正在研制的有感应直线加速器和工业探伤用电子直线加速器等。
    在应用上，国内已有７０多台医用加速器投入运行；工业辐照应用市场正在开拓，北京、上海、西南、西北、东北都在形成具有一定规模的工业辐照中心；用于工业探伤的加速器已增到１０多台。
