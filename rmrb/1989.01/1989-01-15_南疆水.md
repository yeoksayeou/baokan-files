	Water in Southern Xinjiang
	By Luo Pan, People's Daily Reporter

	We crossed the Tian Shan Mountains, stretching from west to east for thousands of miles, and arrived at the southern foothills of the Tian Shan. From here to the Pamir Plateau lies Southern Xinjiang, home to the Uyghur people, including more than ten counties and cities such as Kashgar and Hotan.

	Li Zhiming, the director of the Anti-Epidemic and Water Improvement Office in Kashgar Region, had just returned from a rural survey. He described to me what he had seen with his own eyes.

	Just a few days ago, Li Zhiming saw an elderly Uyghur woman squatting by a pit, drawing water. The pit was about an acre in size, and half of it was covered with a greenish, leaf-strewn water surface. A few sheep were drinking water by the edge. Li Zhiming asked, "Old sister, why do you need this dirty water?" The old woman looked up and said, "To drink. There is no other water available!"

	Li Zhiming told me, "The water this old woman is drawing is from a pond." It is said that there are at least 50,000 such ponds in Southern Xinjiang, serving as the primary drinking water source for Uyghur farmers.

	Indeed, ponds are ubiquitous in rural Southern Xinjiang. An elderly Uyghur man gestured as he told me, "It rarely rains here. We rely on diverting river water through small canals to the ponds at the village entrance during the summer. Within a month, the water turns green, and insects start to appear. In winter and spring, when the pond water dries up, farmers dig holes in the mud at the bottom to get water, continuing this cycle year after year, from their grandfather's time, and even earlier."

	I saw that some ponds were surrounded by walls and fences. Kurban, the deputy director of the Anti-Epidemic and Water Improvement Office in Kashgar Region, said, "Since 1986, farmers in Shule County and Shufu County began to doubt the safety of pond water. The reason is that both counties had outbreaks of infectious diseases. Thus, villagers agreed to use only public water buckets for drawing water and built walls and fences around the ponds. However, these measures seemed to have little effect. By the summer of 1987, many villages had outbreaks of infectious diseases again."

	The urban population in Southern Xinjiang has long enjoyed clean and hygienic tap water, but out of the nearly 3 million rural population, about 77% of people and 80% of livestock still drink pond water.

	In December 1987, a few soldiers arrived in Yuqiakeqike Village, Shule County. The leader, with a touch of gray at his temples, stood at the door of Uyghur farmer Hasimu's home, ready to push the door open. The village party secretary stopped him, saying, "Comrade Commander, please don't go in. Someone in this family has hepatitis!" The commander firmly pushed the door open, saw the exhausted face of the patient, and that night issued an order: "Spare no effort to ensure that all villagers have access to clean and hygienic water by the start of spring!" At that time, he had only been in office for 10 days.

	Three months later, the 1,800-plus Uyghur residents of this village banged drums and gongs to bid farewell to pond water, drinking for the first time water pumped from a 40-meter-deep well. A document from the Shule County People's Government records: "... The troops deployed 1,350 personnel and 330 vehicles, allocating 150,000 yuan. In 1988, not a single case of infectious disease was reported in the village!"

	The Anti-Epidemic and Water Improvement Offices in several regions and counties in Southern Xinjiang are at the forefront of water treatment. In the Kashgar Region Anti-Epidemic and Water Improvement Office, Director Li Zhiming and Deputy Director Kurban, while issuing orders to incoming and outgoing officials based on a map, took the time to brief me on the situation. Li Zhiming said, "The fundamental solution to anti-epidemic and water improvement lies in two areas: completely eliminating water source pollution and tapping underground water sources. Currently, all counties are drilling wells, and the state has allocated tens of millions of yuan in special funds. However, funds are still very tight because Uyghur farmers in Southern Xinjiang have historically been quite poor, and self-raised funds are minimal. Despite this, we must do our best with limited funds to drill as many wells as possible." Kurban told me that in areas with infectious diseases, conducting anti-epidemic and water improvement work requires great caution to avoid contracting the disease. Those at the forefront are mostly Communist Party members and People's Liberation Army soldiers from both ethnic groups. I also heard that in the Southern Xinjiang Military Region, there is a soldier named He Zizhou who, in the winter of 1987, learned that the water improvement project in Shule County urgently needed a batch of insulated plastic pipes. He volunteered to drive a truck to Manas County, 1,000 kilometers away, to fetch the goods. Half a month later, he returned with the goods in the icy and snowy weather, but his fingers and toes were frostbitten, and his ears turned black.

	Under the direct care of the Central Patriotic Hygiene Committee, the Ministry of Health, and the Party Committee and People's Government of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, by the National Day of 1988, the number of rural residents in Southern Xinjiang drinking clean and hygienic tap water had significantly increased. According to local government investigations, in villages where the drinking water problem has been solved, no cases of infectious diseases have been reported. In a village downstream of the Tuman River, I saw a Uyghur woman drawing water from a tap. Her name is Pashaguli. She told me, "I had hepatitis and stayed in the hospital for several months. Drinking this sweet water, I have energy to work again!" At that moment, more than a dozen Uyghur farmers came over. An old man said, "Land reform was our first liberation; drinking sweet water is our second liberation! Our descendants will forever remember who brought us this sweet water!" They heard that I came from Beijing and insisted on inviting me to their homes, saying they would slaughter the fattest sheep to express their gratitude.

　　南疆水
    本报记者  罗盘
    翻越由西向东、横亘千里的天山山脉，我们来到天山的南麓。从这里到帕米尔高原，便是维吾尔族同胞聚居的南疆，它包括喀什、和田等地区的１０多个县市。
    喀什地区防病改水办公室主任李智明才从农村调查回来，他向我描述他亲眼看到的事实。
    前几天，李智明在阿卡什乡看到一位维吾尔族老人蹲在土坑边打水。土坑一亩见方，半坑油绿油绿的水面上，飘着树叶，坑边还有几只饮水的绵羊。李智明问：“老姐姐，这么脏的水，你要它干啥？”老人抬头道：“喝。除了这坑里的水，实在没有水了！”
    李智明告诉我：“这位老人打的就是涝坝水。”据说，南疆的涝坝，至少有５万多个，是维吾尔族农民的主要饮用水源。
    南疆农村的涝坝果然比比皆是。一位维吾尔族老汉比比划划地告诉我，这地方很少下雨，全靠夏季把河里的水通过小渠引到村头的涝坝里。不到一个月，水就变绿了，虫也多起来了。冬天和春天，涝坝的水干了，农民们就在坝底的烂泥中掘洞取水，一直到夏季来临，一年又一年，从爷爷的爷爷，甚至更早时便如此。
    我看到有的涝坝四周垒着围墙和栅栏。喀什地区防病改水办公室副主任库尔班说：“从１９８６年起，疏勒县、疏附县的农民首先对涝坝水产生了怀疑，原因是这两个县都发生了传染病，于是，村民们约定打水只能用公共水桶，同时，在涝坝的四周垒起了围墙和栅栏。但是，这一切好像并没有多大意义。到１９８７年夏天，许多农村又出现了传染病。”
    南疆的城市人口早已吃上了干净卫生的自来水，但这里不下３００万的农村人口中，约７７％的人，约８０％的牲畜在喝涝坝水。
    １９８７年１２月，疏勒县尤卡克其其村来了几位军人，领队的那个人，鬓角已染上微霜。他来到维吾尔族农民哈斯木家门口，正要推门而入，村党支部书记拉住他说：“段司令，您千万别进去，这家有人患了肝炎！”司令员毅然推门而入，看到了病人那疲倦不堪的脸，当晚就下达命令：“全力以赴，开春之前保证全村群众吃上清洁卫生的水！”当时，他到任才１０天。
    ３个月后，这个村的１８００多名维吾尔族群众敲锣打鼓告别涝坝水，第一次喝到了从４０多米深的地下抽上来的自来水。疏勒县人民政府的一份材料上这样记载着：“……部队投入兵力１３５０人次，车辆３３０台次，拨款１．５万元。１９８８年，全村没有发现一个传染病患者！”
    南疆几个地区和县里的防病改水办公室，处在治水的最前线。在喀什地区防病改水办公室里，主任李智明、副主任库尔班一边对着地图给进进出出的干部下达指令，一边抽空向我介绍情况。李智明说：“防病改水的根本出路只有两条，一是彻底根治水源污染，二是开采地下水源。现在各县都在打井，国家为此已拨了数千万元专款。但资金还是非常紧张，因为南疆的维吾尔族农民历来比较贫困，自筹资金很少。尽管如此，我们还是要尽力而为，用有限的资金多打几眼水井。”库尔班告诉我，在传染病区开展防病改水，稍不留心就会染上病。冲在第一线的，绝大部分是维汉两族的共产党员、人民解放军官兵。还听说南疆军区有位叫贺子洲的汽车兵，１９８７年冬天，他得知疏勒县改造饮水工程急需一批保温塑料管，请战驾汽车前往１０００公里外的玛纳斯县塑料厂拉货。半个月后，他在冰天雪地里把货拉回来了，可他的手指和脚趾全冻烂了，耳朵也冻得乌黑。
    在中央爱国卫生委员会、卫生部，以及新疆维吾尔自治区党委和人民政府的直接关怀下，到１９８８年国庆节，南疆农村喝上干净卫生的自来水的人大幅度增多了。经过当地政府调查，凡是解决了饮水问题的乡村，都没有出现传染病患者。在吐曼河下游的一个村子里，我看到一位维吾尔族妇女在自来水龙头前提水，她叫帕夏古丽。她对我说：“我患了肝炎，在医院住了几个月。喝上了这么甜的水，我干活也有力气了！”这时，有十几个维吾尔族农民走过来，一位老汉说：“土改是我们的第一次解放；喝上甜水，是我们的第二次解放！我们的子孙后代永远不会忘记是谁给我们送来了甜水！”他们听说我来自北京，纷纷拉我去家里做客，说要宰最肥的羊表达心意。
