On New Year's Eve, through satellite transmission, the Central Television Station broadcasted the Vienna New Year's Concert live for the first time. Hundreds of millions of Chinese viewers felt as if they were in the "Golden Hall" of the Vienna Music Society, "directly" enjoying the performance of eleven pieces by Johann Strauss, Josef Strauss, and Johann Strauss Sr., conducted by Carlos Kleiber and performed by the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra.

During the New Year, people always have new hopes for the future. At this moment, listening to the music of the Strauss family, one feels a particularly strong resonance. Because the music of the Strauss family is always beautiful and elegant, yet full of youthful vigor and passion, stirring the audience's youthful energy and enthusiasm.

The Vienna New Year's Concert was established exactly half a century ago. For 50 years, Strauss's music has been performed in the Golden Hall every New Year's Day (the first ten years were on New Year's Eve). Since the television broadcast began in 1959, dance performances have also been included. The first 49 performances were conducted by famous conductors such as Klaus, Böhm, Markehl, Karajan, and Abbado. It was decided last year that from this year onwards, the conductor would not be repeated. Mr. Kleiber is the sixth conductor. He is a famous Austrian conductor who has conducted many famous symphony orchestras, opera houses, and music festivals in Europe. This time, he vividly and subtly conveyed the rich, indescribable content of the music through his expressions, gestures, and movements, leading the orchestra, the Golden Hall, and millions of listeners thousands of miles away into an enchanting musical atmosphere. The Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, which performed the concert, has a history of nearly a century and a half. It was praised by Brahms as the "world's first" and is recognized as one of the world's top three orchestras today.

The music of the Strauss family, represented by Johann Strauss Jr., is not unfamiliar to Chinese audiences. Including the pieces performed this time, such as "The Blue Danube" and "The Voices of Spring," many pieces have been well-known in China for a long time. Music from over a century ago, performed year after year, always gives people a fresh and new feeling. Why does this music have such enduring, transnational, and timeless charm? This is a complex question in musical aesthetics that cannot be answered in a few words. But I cannot help but think of two points:

Firstly, the unity of national characteristics and internationalism. Undoubtedly, the music of the Strauss family has distinct national characteristics. The customs, public life, and natural scenery of Vienna are most typically elevated in the works of the Strauss family. The polkas we hear are a reflection of the Viennese people's optimistic, enthusiastic, excited, and humorous character. The "Vienna Waltz" is a special rhythm marked by the Vienna style. From pieces like "The Blue Danube" (especially the overture) and "The Voices of Spring," you will have associations with the natural beauty of Vienna. In short, the music of the Strauss family is deeply rooted in a specific nation and region. But there must also be an international aspect. Indeed, internationalism without national characteristics is weak and colorless; conversely, national characteristics without internationalism can only be narrow musical nationalism, difficult for listeners from other nations to understand emotionally. Only the unity of the two can make listeners from different countries and nations feel familiar and intimate, as if meeting an old friend.

Secondly, the unity of seriousness and popularity. The music of the Strauss family can be said to be a model of reconciling the conflict between the refined and the popular. Is it "popular"? It is so elegant and refined, with not a trace of vulgarity. Is it "refined"? It is so simple and easy to understand, close to the hearts of ordinary listeners. Enjoying it does not require a rational ear or deep professional training. Listeners will naturally and unconsciously be led into a beautiful realm. From the standpoint of artistic democracy, composers have the freedom to pursue any kind of refinement or popularity, and both have their specific values. But I personally believe that truly great music should be able to enter the hearts of millions of listeners and guide them into a higher spiritual realm. Compared to pure "refinement" or "popularity," achieving the unity of the two may be a more difficult goal.

For the "live broadcast" of overseas activities, as far as I can remember, it has almost always been associated with sports. This precedent is good. We must admit that the aesthetic enjoyment, spiritual enlightenment, and moral cultivation provided by high-level concerts are irreplaceable. I think that after enjoying the Vienna New Year's Concert, we must have a deeper understanding of this.

　　约翰·施特劳斯的魅力
    ——维也纳新年音乐会感后
    魏廷格
    元旦夜晚，通过卫星传送，中央电视台首次现场直播了维也纳新年音乐会。数以亿计的中国观众，仿佛置身于维也纳音乐之友协会的“金色大厅”之中，“直接”欣赏了由卡洛斯·克莱伯指挥、维也纳爱乐乐团演奏的约翰·施特劳斯和约瑟夫·施特劳斯兄弟及老约翰·施特劳斯的十一首乐曲。
    新年间，人们总是对未来寄与新的希望。此刻欣赏施特劳斯氏的音乐，会产生格外强烈的共鸣。因为，施氏音乐永远美丽优雅而又朝气蓬勃，激起听众青春般的活力和热情。
    维也纳新年音乐会创始于整整半个世纪以前。５０年来，每年元旦（开始十年为除夕）都在金色大厅演奏施氏音乐。自１９５９年电视直播以来，又有舞蹈场面伴随。前４９届荣任指挥的先后有克劳斯、波斯克夫斯基、玛赛尔、卡拉扬、阿巴多这些驰名乐坛的指挥家。去年决定，自今年起指挥不再重复。克莱伯先生是第六位指挥。他是奥地利著名指挥家，曾担任过许多欧洲著名的交响乐团、歌剧院或音乐节的指挥。这次，他用生动微妙的表情、手势、动作，精美地传达出音乐中难以言传的丰富内涵，将乐队，将金色大厅及万里之外的亿万听众，引入一种迷人的音乐气氛之中。担任演奏的维也纳爱乐乐团已有近一个半世纪的历史。曾被勃拉姆斯赞为“世界第一”，是当代音乐界公认的世界三大乐团之一。
    以小约翰为代表的施氏音乐，中国听众并不陌生。包括这次演奏的《春之声》、《蓝色多瑙河》在内的许许多多乐曲，在中国早已家喻户晓。一个多世纪前的音乐，年年演奏，年年给人耳目一新之感。这些音乐何以有这种持久的超国界超时代的魅力？这是三言两语说不清的音乐美学问题。但我不由得想到了两点：
    其一，民族性与国际性的统一。无疑，施氏音乐有鲜明的民族性。维也纳的风俗人情、公众生活、自然风光在音乐中最典型的升华，莫过于施氏作品。我们听到的波尔卡，那是维也纳人乐观、热烈、兴奋而又诙谐的性格的再现。“维也纳圆舞曲”，更是打着维也纳印记的一种特殊韵律的标志。从《蓝色多瑙河》（尤其是序奏）、《春之声》等乐曲中，你会产生对维也纳大自然的联想。总之，施氏音乐是根生于特定民族、地域的。但一定还有一种国际性。诚然，脱离民族性的国际性，是苍白无力的；反过来，不与国际性联系起来的民族性，又只能是狭隘的音乐民族主义，难以被外民族听众从感情上理解。唯有二者的统一，才能使不同国度、民族的听众都感到亲切、熟悉，仿佛故友相逢。
    其二，严肃性与通俗性的统一。施氏音乐，可谓调和雅俗矛盾的典范。说它“俗”吗？它是何等优雅、精致，绝无一丝粗俗痕迹。说它“雅”吗？它是如此通俗易懂，贴近普通听众的心。欣赏它，无须理性的耳朵或深奥的专业修养。听众会那么自然而然、情不自禁地随它来到一种美的境界。站在艺术民主的立场，作曲家有追求任何种类的雅或俗的自由，也都不乏其特定的价值。但我个人认为，真正伟大的音乐，应当是既能深入千百万听众的内心，又能引导他们进入更高精神境界的。与单纯的“雅”或“俗”相比，实现二者的统一，也许是更为艰难的目标。
    对于域外活动的“现场直播”，就记忆所及，几乎只与体育活动有缘。这次这个先例开得好。应当承认，高水平音乐会所给予人们的美的享受、心灵的启迪、情操的陶冶，是不可替代的。我想，欣赏了维也纳新年音乐会后，我们一定对此有了更深切的感触。
