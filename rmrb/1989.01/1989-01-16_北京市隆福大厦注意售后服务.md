	Beijing's Longfu Building, since its opening, has paid close attention to after-sales service work. It has specially established a service department for repaired items on the bustling Wangfujing Street to provide after-sales service for household electronic and electrical products. At the same time, it has helped some manufacturers establish special repair service centers.

	To facilitate customers and solve the problem of transporting large household appliances for repairs, the service department has launched on-site repair services for refrigerators and washing machines. In the past half year, the department has provided on-site services for nearly a thousand washing machine repairs alone.

	The Longfu Building service department has also addressed the issue of the difficulty in obtaining spare parts for Japanese electrical products by dispatching personnel to contact the manufacturers of the product parts and resolving the parts issue through various means.
