Western diplomats stationed in Afghanistan have recently been leaving Kabul in droves. This is a signal: as the Soviet troops are about to withdraw completely from Afghanistan, the situation in Kabul has become even more tense.

The first to take action was the West German embassy. On January 21, three diplomats from this embassy boarded a plane to leave Afghanistan via New Delhi and return home, leaving only one local employee to guard the embassy. One of the important tasks of this employee is to raise and lower the national flag every day as a sign that the embassy has not closed. Meanwhile, the British embassy in Afghanistan has issued a warning to British citizens in Kabul and the citizens of the other six countries it represents diplomatically, urging them to leave Afghanistan while there are still flights available. A spokesperson for the U.S. embassy said they might also advise the 11 American citizens currently staying in Afghanistan to leave, but no final decision has been made. Additionally, some international organizations in Kabul, including the United Nations Children's Fund, have decided to leave one person from each organization to stay, while the rest of the staff will be withdrawn.

The primary concern of Western diplomats is that after the Soviet troops withdraw, the security situation in Kabul will deteriorate. According to the Geneva Agreement, Soviet troops are to withdraw completely by February 15. According to reports from Western news agencies, after 100,000 invading Soviet troops withdrew half of their forces last August, another approximately 12,000 have withdrawn this year. The remaining Soviet troops are concentrated in Kabul and northern Afghanistan near the Soviet Union. Currently, the defense lines around Kabul have been handed over to the government forces of Najibullah. Kabul is effectively surrounded by the resistance forces' guerrilla fighters. In the past half year, due to rocket attacks by the guerrilla forces, the Kabul airport has been temporarily closed several times. People are worried that once the Soviet troops withdraw completely, regular flights to the outside world from Kabul will be difficult to maintain.

Currently, due to the blockade by the resistance forces' guerrilla fighters, food and fuel supplies in Kabul are extremely scarce. The authorities have begun to implement rationing of food, with each person receiving 200 grams of bread per day. In front of state-run gas stations, various vehicles form long queues, sometimes having to wait for 3 hours to buy 10 liters of gasoline. On the black market, the prices of firewood, salt, and sugar have doubled in less than a month. On January 21, dozens of Soviet transport planes delivered 350 tons of flour and food to Kabul to relieve the urgent situation. However, this is not enough to reverse the tight supply situation for a city with nearly 2 million people.

The political background of the withdrawal of Western diplomats is that the various political factions in Afghanistan have significant differences on the issue of forming a united government to achieve national reconciliation. Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister and Ambassador to Afghanistan Vorontsov recently visited Iran and Pakistan and held talks with various resistance forces, but no positive results were achieved. The various resistance forces in Afghanistan unanimously demand that the People's Democratic Party, which is in power in Kabul, hand over power and allow them to form a broad-based government excluding the People's Democratic Party. However, the Soviet Union insists that the future government must include the People's Democratic Party.

However, there are also major differences among the resistance forces. The seven-party alliance based in Pakistan advocates the establishment of a consultative assembly with 480 members to appoint a new government. The allocation of seats is 60 members from each of the seven-party alliance's member parties, and 60 members from the eight-party alliance based in Iran. The eight-party alliance expressed opposition, demanding that it have at least 120 members. The consultative assembly, originally scheduled to be established on February 1, has now been announced to be postponed. The seven-party alliance will send a delegation to Iran for further consultations.

Within the seven-party alliance, there are also disagreements over the issue of whether the former King Zahir Shah, who is in exile in Rome, should participate in the consultative assembly. The four parties known as fundamentalists oppose any role for Zahir Shah in Afghanistan's political situation.

Political observers believe that with about 20 days left until the Soviet Union's complete withdrawal from Afghanistan, achieving national reconciliation in this period is very difficult, and armed conflicts between the opposing political forces in Afghanistan are inevitable.

### 喀布尔局势更趋紧张

　　喀布尔局势更趋紧张
    新华社记者  马光
    西方国家驻阿富汗的外交人员最近纷纷离开喀布尔。这是一个信号：在苏联军队即将全部撤出阿富汗之际，喀布尔的局势变得更加紧张了。
    率先采取行动的是联邦德国大使馆。１月２１日，这个使馆的３名外交官乘飞机离开阿富汗取道新德里回国，仅留下一名当地雇员看守使馆。这名雇员的一项重要任务是每天升降国旗，作为使馆并未关闭的标志。与此同时，英国驻阿富汗大使馆已向在喀布尔的英国人以及它在外交上所代表的其他６个国家的公民发出警告，要他们在还有班机可乘时赶快离开阿富汗。美国使馆的发言人说，他们可能也将劝说正在阿富汗逗留的１１名美国公民离开阿富汗，但尚未作出最后的决定。另外，一些在喀布尔的国际机构，包括联合国儿童基金会，已决定让每个机构留守１人，其他人员全部撤走。
    西方外交人员担心的主要问题是，苏军全部撤走后，喀布尔的安全条件会恶化。根据日内瓦协议，苏军应于２月１５日前全部撤完。据西方通讯社报道，１０万侵阿苏军在去年８月撤出一半之后，今年以来又有约１．２万名撤走，剩余的苏军集结在喀布尔和阿富汗北部靠近苏联的地区。目前，喀布尔外围的防线已经移交给纳吉布拉政府军。喀布尔实际上处于抵抗力量游击队的包围中。在过去半年里，由于受到游击队火箭的袭击，喀布尔机场曾几次短时间关闭。人们担心，一旦苏军全部撤走，喀布尔通往外界的定期航班将难以维持。
    目前，由于抵抗力量游击队的封锁，喀布尔市食品和燃料供应奇缺。当局开始实行食品定量供给，每人每天２００克面包。在国营加油站前，各种车辆排成长队，有时要等３小时才能买到１０公升汽油。黑市上木柴、食盐和糖的价格在不到一个月里上涨了一倍。１月２１日，数十架苏联运输机将３５０吨面粉和食品运到喀布尔，以解燃眉之急。但这对有近２００万人口的喀布尔来说，并不能扭转供应紧张的局面。
    西方外交人员撤离的政治背景是，阿富汗各派政治势力在组织联合政府实现民族和解的问题上分歧仍然很大。苏联副外长兼驻阿富汗大使沃龙佐夫最近先后访问伊朗和巴基斯坦，同各派抵抗力量会谈，没有取得积极的成果。阿富汗各派抵抗力量一致主张，在喀布尔执政的人民民主党应该交出政权，由他们组建排除人民民主党的基础广泛的政府。而苏联则坚持未来的政府要有人民民主党参加。
    但是，在抵抗力量各派之间也有重大分歧。以巴基斯坦为基地的七党联盟主张成立有４８０名议员的协商议会，来任命新政府。议员的名额分配是七党联盟的每个成员党各出６０名，以伊朗为基地的八党联盟也出６０名。八党联盟表示反对，要求它至少出１２０名议员。协商议会原定２月１日成立，现已宣布推迟。七党联盟将派代表团去伊朗继续磋商。
    在七党联盟内部，对流亡在罗马的前国王查希尔参加协商议会的问题也不一致。被称为原教旨主义者的４个政党反对查希尔在阿富汗政局中发挥任何作用。
    政治观察家认为，现在离苏联从阿富汗全部撤军的期限还有约２０天，在此期间实现民族和解已很困难，阿富汗敌对政治势力之间的战斗在所难免。
