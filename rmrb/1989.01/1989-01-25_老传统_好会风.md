In early November 1988, the Yunnan Provincial Party History Materials Collection Committee held a meeting in Kunming to review historical documents. Among the more than thirty participants, the majority were former provincial and departmental leaders. These included the former Deputy Minister of the Sixth Ministry, former Deputy Secretary of the Yunnan Provincial Party Committee, former Chairman of the Provincial People's Political Consultative Conference, former Vice Chairman of the Provincial People's Congress, and former Vice Chairman of the Provincial Advisory Committee. The Deputy Director of the Central Committee's Party History Research Office also attended and gave a speech.

The meeting was held in the modestly furnished Provincial Party Committee's Senior Cadres Activity Room. Each participant was provided with a cup of plain tea, and no meals or refreshments were served during the meeting. There were no welcoming banquets or farewell dinners, and no sightseeing activities were arranged during the meeting. Upon conclusion, no souvenirs were distributed. The three-day document review meeting incurred only 180 yuan in rental fees for the meeting room. The meeting was conducted in a simple, solemn, and lively manner. These old comrades, who had once galloped across the battlefield in the war years and made significant contributions to the construction of Yunnan after the founding of the nation, set a good example for us in advocating for a good meeting style.

　　老传统　好会风
    一九八八年十一月初，云南省委党史资料征集委员会在昆明召开有关史料审稿会。参加审稿会的三十多人中，绝大多数曾是省级和厅级领导干部。其中有原六机部副部长、原云南省委副书记、省政协主席、省人大副主任、省顾委副主任等，中共中央党史研究室副主任也到会讲了话。
    会议在陈设简陋的省委老干部活动室举行，每人一杯清茶，不设会议伙食，不摆接风酒，饯行宴。会议期间，没有安排游览风景名胜的活动，闭会也不发纪念品。三天的审稿会仅开支会议室租用费一百八十元，会议开得十分简朴、庄重、热烈。这些在战争年代驰骋疆场，建国后为建设云南作出过重大贡献的老同志们，为我们提倡良好的会风起了表率作用。
