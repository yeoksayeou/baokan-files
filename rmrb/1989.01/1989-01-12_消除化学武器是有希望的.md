Recently, the issue of "chemical warfare" and "chemical weapons" has once again drawn the attention of the international community. Representatives from 145 countries gathered in Paris for the International Conference on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.

Various media outlets have extensively reported on this conference, allowing people to gain a better understanding of this issue.

The convening of the International Conference on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in Paris reflects the serious concern of people around the world regarding chemical warfare and chemical weapons. Since the end of World War II, incidents involving the use of chemical weapons have occurred from time to time. According to foreign media reports, chemical warfare on an unprecedented scale and frequency occurred in the Gulf War in recent years. What is particularly worrying is that the number of countries and regions possessing chemical weapons is increasing, and the chemical weapons technology of major military powers is advancing. This casts a shadow over the sense of security that people have gained from the easing of international tensions over the past two years. Therefore, there is a widespread demand to adhere to the obligations stipulated in the 1925 Geneva Protocol to not use chemical weapons. Furthermore, there is a call to swiftly conclude a global, verifiable convention that prohibits the use, development, production, stockpiling, possession, transfer, and acquisition of chemical weapons and chemical weapons production facilities. The goal is to completely destroy existing chemical weapons and production facilities, ensuring that no new chemical weapons or production facilities emerge, thereby ultimately eliminating the threat of chemical warfare to humanity. This is the main scope and purpose of the comprehensive and thorough Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons that is currently under negotiation.

The negotiations for this convention can be traced back to 1969, but substantive negotiations did not begin until the 1980s. After eight years of negotiations, the convention has taken shape, and some clauses already have the nature of final texts. However, considering that the purpose of the convention is to fundamentally abolish an entire category of warfare, it is necessary to address extremely complex technical issues (since chemical weapons are closely related to civilian chemical industries). The negotiations are conducted within an international organization composed of 40 countries from different political groups and different levels of development, making the negotiations naturally difficult. Nevertheless, compared to other arms control negotiations, the negotiations for the Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons have progressed relatively quickly. It is considered the only negotiation topic that has the potential to reach an agreement in the near future through the Conference on Disarmament, the sole multilateral arms control body.

Since the negotiations for the Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons entered the substantive stage, they have shown a stable development trend. Since 1982, delegations from member countries of the Warsaw Pact and NATO have almost reached an agreement or made significant progress on the basic content of the convention each year. During this period, events such as the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the U.S. production of binary chemical weapons had only symbolic impacts on the negotiations and did not fundamentally change the practical direction of the negotiations.

The reasons for this are as follows: Firstly, relatively speaking, chemical weapons are not an important means of military competition or national security for superpowers. Their strategic position cannot be compared to that of nuclear weapons. Their military value is not as indispensable as that of conventional weapons. The history of arms control negotiations has proven that the less important the weapons, the easier it is to reach a control agreement. Secondly, the two major military blocs that dominate the arms control struggle have taken an active stance on the reduction of chemical weapons. The rapid convergence of East-West positions on chemical weapons reduction is mainly due to the inherent logic of the arms control struggle.

At present, the Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has taken shape, although there are still some differences, the trend towards reaching an agreement seems irreversible. Some countries have explicitly advocated that it is both possible and necessary to overcome difficulties this year, conclude the negotiations, sign the convention, and then begin the phased destruction of chemical weapons and their production facilities within one year after the convention comes into effect, completing the process within nine years. According to this, if the progress is smooth, the 1990s will become the decade of chemical weapons destruction. The realization of this wish hinges on the political will of the relevant countries. People are hoping that the day when the threat of chemical weapons is completely eliminated will come soon.

　　消除化学武器是有希望的
    于中洲
    最近一周，“化学战”和“化学武器”又一次引起了国际社会的共同的关注，为数多达１４５个国家的代表团在巴黎举行了禁止化学武器国际大会。
    各国舆论对这次会议作了广泛的报道，使人们对这一问题有了更多的了解。
    巴黎禁止化学武器国际大会的召开，表明了人们对化学战和化学武器的严重关切。自从第二次世界大战结束以来，使用化学武器的事件时有发生。据外电报道，近年在海湾战争中还发生了自第一次世界大战以来规模和频度空前的化学战。尤其令人不安的是，世界上拥有化学武器的国家和地区在增加，军事大国的化学武器技术在发展，这就给世界人民从近两年来国际形势趋向缓和中产生的安全感投上一层阴影。因此，人们普遍要求恪守１９２５年日内瓦议定书规定的不使用化学武器的义务，并且主张尽快缔结一项全球性的可以核查的公约，规定禁止使用，并且禁止发展、生产、贮存、保有、转让、获得化学武器及化学武器生产设施，彻底销毁现有的化学武器和生产设施，确保不再出现新的化学武器和生产设施，从而最终地根除化学战对人类的威胁。这就是正在谈判的全面彻底禁止化学武器公约的主要范围和目的。
    这项谈判虽然可以追溯到１９６９年，但真正开始实质性的谈判则是进入８０年代之后。经过８年的谈判，公约已具雏形，某些条款已经具有最后文本的性质。然而，考虑到公约的目的是从根本上废止一整类战争手段，需要处理非常复杂的技术问题（因为化学武器与民用化工的关系密切）。谈判又是在由４０个来自不同政治集团和不同发展程度的国家组成的国际机构中进行，谈判自然是艰难的。但与其它军控谈判相比，禁止化学武器公约的谈判进展相对较快。被认为是有可能在近期内由裁军谈判会议这个唯一的多边军控机构达成协议的唯一谈判议题。
    关于禁止化学武器公约的谈判进入实质性阶段之后，一直呈现稳定发展的势头。１９８２年以来，分属华约和北约的成员国代表团对于公约的基本内容，几乎每年都能达成一项一致或取得重要进展。这期间发生的苏军入侵阿富汗、美国投产二元化学武器等事件，对谈判只产生了某些象征性的影响，基本上没有改变谈判的务实方向。
    究其原因，首先，相对而言，化学武器对超级大国之间的争夺或国家安全并不是一种重要的军备手段。它的战略地位不能与核武器相比。它的军事价值又不像常规兵器那样须臾不可或缺。裁军谈判的历史证明，越是次要的军备越是容易达成控制协议。其次，在军控斗争中处于主导地位的两大军事集团对化学武器裁军态度积极。东西方在化学武器裁军上的立场能够迅速接近，主要是军控斗争自身的逻辑力量所致。
    目前，禁止化学武器公约已大体成形，尽管还有一些分歧，但达成协议的大趋势似已不可逆转。有的国家明确主张，应该而且也有可能在今年内排除困难，结束谈判，签署公约，然后在公约生效后１年内开始分阶段销毁化学武器及其生产设施，９年内完成。据此，如进展顺利，９０年代将会成为销毁化学武器的年代。这一愿望能否实现的症结在于各有关国家的政治决心。人们盼望彻底免除化学武器威胁的日子能够早日到来。
