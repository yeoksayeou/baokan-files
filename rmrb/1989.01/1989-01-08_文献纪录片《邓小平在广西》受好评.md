The documentary "Deng Xiaoping in Guangxi," co-produced by the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Radio and Television Bureau and the Guangxi Film Studio, has recently been completed.

On January 7, a symposium was held in Beijing, where Yang Chengwu, Mo Wenhuo, Zhong Fuzhang, Ding Jiao, and others gave high praise to the film.

The documentary, with Wang Zhen as the chief consultant, has both film and television versions. Based on recent research by the Party History Department, it truthfully records Deng Xiaoping's revolutionary activities in Guangxi from 1929 to 1930, including the establishment of the Red Seventh Army and the Red Eighth Army, leading the Baise Uprising, and creating the Left and Right River revolutionary base areas. The film weaves historical materials with real-life scenes, embodying the spirit of seeking truth from facts and reflecting contemporary characteristics.
