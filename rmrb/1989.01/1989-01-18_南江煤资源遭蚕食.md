The key energy construction project in our province, Guangwang Mining Bureau's Nanjiang Coal Mine, has a planned state investment of 52.5 million yuan. Once completed, it can provide 300,000 tons of high-quality smokeless coal annually. Currently, the Nanjiang Coal Mine has entered the stage of mine construction and production, but the persistent problem of small coal mines seizing resources is worsening. This has resulted in the mine field being riddled with holes, seriously affecting the reasonable layout of the mining areas and the smooth operation of the mine, making it difficult for the state's substantial investment to yield the expected returns.

The originally planned mining area for this year has had more than one-third of its coal resources seized by three small coal mines. Two out of the six planned working faces have been affected, with a reserve of approximately 300,000 tons. In the third mining area, 10 small coal mines have been operating beyond their boundaries, severely disrupting the normal construction of the mine. According to investigations, along less than two kilometers of the riverbank within the Nanjiang mine field, there are 14 small coal mines.

To stop the illegal mining, the Sichuan Provincial Mineral Resources Management Commission sent personnel to conduct on-site investigations and coordinated with the Sichuan Coal Management Bureau, Nanjiang County, and the mining construction units. They ordered the small coal mines that violated regulations to immediately stop operations and those that exceeded their boundaries to retreat within the designated lines. However, those engaged in illegal mining paid no heed and even obstructed the smooth conduct of the investigation and measurement work.

　　南江煤资源遭蚕食
    我省能源建设重点项目——广旺矿务局南江煤矿，国家计划投资５２５０万元，建成后，每年可提供３０万吨优质无烟煤。现在，南江煤矿已进入矿井成型投产建设阶段，但屡禁不止的小煤窑争抢资源日甚，造成井田千疮百孔，严重影响了采区的合理布局和矿井的顺利投产，国家巨额投资难以收到应有的效益。
    原定今年出煤的首采区，煤炭资源已被３个小煤窑侵占了１／３以上，设计中的６个工作面已被吃掉２个，储量约３０万吨。三采区有１０个小煤窑越界开采，严重破坏了矿井的正常施工。据调查，仅南江井田内不到两公里的河岸沿线，就分布着１４个小煤窑。
    为制止乱挖滥采，我省矿产资源管理委员会曾派人来实地调查，并同四川煤管局、南江县及矿建单位协商，责成违反规定开采的小煤窑立即停止作业，越界开采的必须退回规定界线以内。但是，乱挖滥采的人根本不理，甚至阻挠调查测量工作的顺利进行。
