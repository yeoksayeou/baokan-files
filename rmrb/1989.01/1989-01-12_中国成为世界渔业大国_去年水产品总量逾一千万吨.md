China has become a major fishing nation, with its total aquatic product output exceeding 10 million tons last year. This makes China the third country in the world to achieve this milestone. Of this total, 525 million tons were produced through marine and freshwater aquaculture, surpassing the catch for the first time. The per capita availability of aquatic products nationwide reached 9.5 kilograms, and the complaints about the difficulty of obtaining fish are gradually subsiding.

Last year was a year of numerous disasters. In the first half of the year, there were droughts in the south and floods in the north, and in the second half, both the south and the north experienced floods. The "hepatitis A effect" in Shanghai also directly affected the production of shellfish. Despite these adverse factors, various regions focused on increasing investment and improving production conditions as key measures to boost aquatic product output and economic benefits. The area of intensive aquaculture saw a significant increase, and productivity improved accordingly. The rapid rise of cage aquaculture has opened up a promising new path for the development of aquaculture in large and medium-sized water bodies, with 7,300 mu developed last year, an increase of 18.5% over the previous year. The cultivation of marine delicacies such as scallops, abalone, and sea cucumbers has attracted high attention in coastal areas, and development steps have accelerated.

The strategic decision to prioritize the development of marine and freshwater aquaculture, based on China's national conditions, has led to continuous and significant increases in production. However, unfavorable factors are also becoming increasingly apparent, with severe shortages of funds and production materials such as feed. The backward state of aquaculture infrastructure is also a matter of concern for various regions.

### 中国成为世界渔业大国  去年水产品总量逾一千万吨

　　中国成为世界渔业大国
    去年水产品总量逾一千万吨
    本报北京讯  新华社记者任泽励、本报记者黄彩忠报道：我国水产品总产量去年闯过１０００万吨大关，成为当前世界上第三个产量超过１０００万吨的渔业大国，其中海淡水养殖产量５２５万吨，首次超过捕捞产品。全国水产品人均占有量９．５公斤，“吃鱼难”的呼声渐趋平息。
    去年是多灾之年，上半年南旱北涝，下半年南北都涝，上海“甲肝效应”又直接波及贝类生产。面对诸多不利因素，各地把增加投入、改善生产条件，作为增加水产品产量、提高经济效益的主要措施来抓。精养水面有较大增加，单产相应提高。网箱养鱼的迅速崛起，为大中型水域发展养殖业开辟了很有希望的新途径，去年已发展到７３００多亩，比上年增长１８．５％。扇贝、鲍鱼、海参等海珍品养殖生产，已引起沿海各地高度重视，发展步伐加快。
    突出发展海淡水养殖，是根据我国国情采取的战略决策，各种优惠政策促使我国海淡水养殖业持续大幅度增产，但不利因素也日见显露，资金以及饲料等生产资料严重短缺，养殖基础设施落后，值得引起各地高度重视。
