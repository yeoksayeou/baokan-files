In some places, there is a shortage of salt, but reporters at the largest mechanized salt field in China, the Jilantai Salt Field in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, saw 500,000 tons of salt urgently needing to be transported out. The reporters roughly calculated that the salt already produced here, if distributed at 0.5 kilograms per person per month for over 100 million people nationwide, would last for a month. Walking into the guesthouse of the salt field, reporters saw more than ten provinces (regions) sending people to urge the delivery of salt, all complaining to the reporters: factories are "out of steam," citizens are lining up to buy salt; a person from Hulunbuir League in Inner Mongolia told the reporters: their league plans to supply 29,000 tons of salt annually, all relying on Jilantai Salt Field. If some banners and counties cannot get the salt before the mountains are blocked by snow, the herdsmen and farmers in these places will have "no salt to eat" during the New Year or Spring Festival!

The "Jilantai Salt" produced by Jilantai Salt Field is famous. The annual production is 700,000 tons. By the end of last October, the annual task had been completed. In late November, the refinery stopped production because the warehouse was full. Last year, the state's mandatory plan for Jilantai Salt Field was to transport and sell various types of salt totaling 622,500 tons. The salt supply contracts signed with users amounted to 720,000 tons. However, due to insufficient railway capacity, by November 14, only 518,000 tons had been transported, making it impossible to complete the state's transportation plan.

Jilantai Salt Field is responsible for supplying food salt to 13 provinces (regions) and 46 million people, as well as raw material salt to dozens of chemical enterprises. Now, chemical enterprises have no salt, and the people lack food salt, leading to the circulation of inferior and harmful salt, endangering people's health. The black market for salt, which has not appeared for many years, has also emerged in some places. This concerns national economy and people's livelihood. It is hoped that relevant departments, especially the railway transportation department, will pay enough attention and take urgent measures to transport the salt!

### 五十万吨吉盐亟待外运

　　五十万吨吉盐亟待外运
    在一些地方食盐告急的时候，记者在我国目前规模最大的机械化湖盐场——内蒙古自治区吉兰泰盐场看到的却是５０万吨盐亟待外运的景象。记者粗略算了一笔帐，这里已生产出来的盐，按全国十多亿人口一人一月０．５公斤计算，可吃一个月。走到盐场招待所，十几个省（区）的催货人争相向记者“诉苦”：工厂“揭不开锅”，市民排队买盐；来自内蒙古呼伦贝尔盟的一位催盐的同志告诉记者：他们盟年计划供应食盐２．９万吨，全靠吉兰泰盐场供应，如果有的旗县大雪封山前运不去盐，这些地方的牧（农）民新年或春节将“食无盐”！
    吉兰泰盐场生产的“吉盐”素负盛名，年产量７０万吨。到去年１０月底已完成全年任务。１１月下旬，精盐厂因为仓库爆满，准备停产。去年国家给吉兰泰盐场下达的指令性计划是运销各种盐６２．２５万吨，场里同用户签订的供盐合同为７２万吨，但由于铁路运力不足，到１１月１４日为止，才运走５１．８万吨，势必完不成国家调运计划。
    吉兰泰盐场承担着１３个省（区）、４６００万人口的食用盐及数十家化工企业的原料盐供应任务。现在，盐化工企业无盐，人民群众缺食盐，导致土劣盐上市，危害人民健康，多少年来从未出现过的食盐黑市也在一些地方出现了。事关国计民生，希望有关部门、特别是铁路运输部门给予足够的重视，赶快采取紧急措施运盐！
