Changzhou Computer Factory in Jiangsu Province has a group of individuals who are skilled in technology, adept at management, and capable of business operations. They are active in various positions within the factory, reviving a factory that was on the brink of closure. Moreover, these individuals have now become "rising stars" in the electronics computer industry.

This factory is a high-tech enterprise with a workforce of over a thousand people, including more than 300 engineering and technical personnel, accounting for one-third of the total workforce. In the past, they focused solely on research and development, neglecting production and market demands, resulting in products that did not meet market needs. Later, they adopted a "forced immersion" approach, sending personnel to conduct market surveys and develop new products. They successively launched the HZ-8401 and HZ-8401A bilingual terminals. Due to the market adaptability of these new products, they not only became bestsellers but also became the first batch of domestically produced computers to be exported and earn foreign exchange. Since 1985, they have won 7 national, ministerial, and provincial quality awards, with a high-quality product rate of over 80%.

　　常州计算机厂培养行业小明星
    本报讯  江苏省常州计算机厂有一批懂技术、会管理、能经营的人活跃在厂里各个岗位上，把一个濒临倒闭的工厂救活了，而且这批人现已成为电子计算机行业的“小明星”。
    这个厂是个高科技企业，千人之厂，各类工程技术人员就有３００多个，占总人数的１／３。过去，他们埋头搞科研，不管生产，不问市场，研制出来的产品不对路。后来，他们用“赶着鸭子下水”的办法，派人搞市场调查，开发新产品，相继推出ＨＺ—８４０１和ＨＺ８４０１Ａ中西文终端机。由于新产品适应市场需要，不仅成了畅销货，还成了国内计算机整机首批出口创汇产品。１９８５年以来，他们获得国优、部优、省优质产品奖７个，优质产品率达８０％以上。
