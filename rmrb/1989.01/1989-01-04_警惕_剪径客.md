Title: Beware of "Shortcut Bandits"

On November 19, 1988, the fifth edition of this newspaper published a reader's letter titled "Prepaid Accommodation Fees—Scam." After that, I visited the Public Transportation Bureau of the Beijing Public Security Bureau. The relevant officials informed me that five lawbreakers had been apprehended. On September 9, at noon, Chen Yucai, who had been released from prison but had not found work, along with his wife Yan Xiaofeng and four others, impersonated staff of the Qianmen Hotel and, in front of the hotel introduction office at Beijing Railway Station, lured 19 passengers onto a temporarily chartered minibus by claiming to introduce them to state-run hotels with good conditions and affordable prices. When the bus passed through Dabeiwao in Chaoyang District, Chen Yucai pretended to collect everyone's IDs to register for accommodation and demanded a deposit of 20 yuan from each person. When some passengers refused to pay, Chen Yucai threatened, "We are ex-convicts, no one can control us. Once you get on the bus, it's like getting on a pirate ship. Hurry up and pay, or we'll take you hostage!" The passengers were forced to pay. Upon arriving at Jingsong Songyuan Hotel, a few passengers saw that the place they were introduced to was a basement and demanded a refund. Chen Yucai and the others refused to return the money and drove away in the minibus. Currently, Chen Yucai has been sent to labor reform for two years, and the others have been administratively detained and fined 200 yuan each.

It is understood that Chen Yucai and his accomplices have been engaged in this "shortcut" business since 1987. On August 21, 1988, Chen Yucai used this method to deceive a compatriot from Taiwan and was detained by the public security authorities for 15 days. Just three days after his release, he resumed his criminal activities. In mid-November, the Beijing Public Transportation Bureau detained another lawbreaker named Zhang Chunsheng, who was an accomplice of Chen Yucai and his group. According to an informant, recently, he saw that Yan Xiaofeng and Zhang Chunsheng, who had been released from detention, were again soliciting customers at Beijing Railway Station.

Currently, there are three types of people soliciting customers at Beijing Railway Station: First, there are hotel staff who have been approved by the Beijing Railway Station Management Office and have vehicles to pick up passengers. They are generally well-behaved but make up a very small portion. Second, there are those who solicit customers illegally. To compete for customers, they use tactics such as "buying train tickets, airplane tickets," etc., to lure passengers. This group numbers over 800 people daily. Third, there are unemployed individuals and released convicts. This group impersonates hotel staff to pick up passengers and racks their brains to extort money from passengers. They are a mixed bunch, and passengers can easily fall victim if they are not careful. The responsible officials of the Beijing Railway Station Management Office said that using the excuse of "soliciting customers" to extort money from passengers has become a social problem that deserves attention.

Why do a group of "shortcut bandits" at Beijing Railway Station brazenly extort money from passengers?

Firstly, the public security authorities lack concrete legal grounds to deal with these "shortcut bandits." To maintain public order, the public security authorities fine and disperse anyone found soliciting customers illegally. However, the fines and dispersals are ineffective, and the number of solicitors only increases. Over time, the public security authorities also find it difficult to handle the situation and consider it a headache. For those "shortcut bandits" who have been caught, except for Chen Yucai who was sent to labor reform, the rest can only be detained for half a month and fined a few hundred yuan. This punishment does not deter them. Therefore, as soon as they are released from detention, they resume their "shortcut" activities.

Secondly, there are loopholes in the current business trip expense reimbursement system. After collecting "service fees" from relevant individuals, Chen Yucai and his accomplices use discarded bus tickets as reimbursement vouchers. This is one of the reasons why this group's "shortcut" business has been thriving over the past two years, while few people report them. This time, after Chen Yucai was caught, he confessed: "I have been doing this for a long time, and this is the first time someone has reported me." Many passengers who were deceived either do not suffer losses because their units can reimburse the discarded bus tickets given by the "shortcut bandits" or think that it is better to avoid trouble and just accept their misfortune. Beijing Railway Station officials said that some people make a living from this "business," earning tens of thousands of yuan a year is not a problem.

Thirdly, there are issues with the chartering of small public buses. Currently, there are dozens of small public buses from eight bus stations at Beijing Railway Station alone. These small public buses not only carry individual passengers but also allow chartering. Therefore, some "shortcut bandits" rent small public buses to lure passengers and force them to comply on the bus. Some bus stations, although they have regulations prohibiting "solicitors" from chartering buses, some drivers, for the sake of a charter fee of forty or fifty yuan, do not care about the identity of the charterers. To this day, the drivers and sales staff of small public buses have not reported any illegal activities of "shortcut bandits" to the public security authorities.

Regarding the problem of collective and individual hotels soliciting customers illegally, relevant departments in Beijing are paying attention to it. The Beijing Railway Station Management Office and the Beijing Railway Station Public Security Sub-bureau have repeatedly suggested to relevant departments to establish an organization to introduce hotels in Haidian District, Fengtai District, Shijingshan District, and Chaoyang District, and to assign personnel to manage these hotels. If this is done, with the assistance of the public security authorities, the phenomenon of illegal solicitation will be greatly reduced or even eliminated. Those "shortcut bandits" who rely on solicitation for a living will lose their foothold.

### 警惕“剪径客”

　　警惕“剪径客”
    本报记者  刘建华
    １９８８年１１月１９日，本报第五版刊登了《“预交住宿费”——骗钱》的读者来信后，我走访了北京市公安局公共交通分局。有关同志告诉我：５名违法分子已被抓获。９月９日中午，刑满释放后未再工作的陈玉才和他的妻子阎晓凤等６人，冒充前门招待所的服务员，在北京火车站旅馆介绍处前，以介绍住宿条件好、价格便宜的国营旅店为名，招揽了１９位旅客，将他们带上了一辆临时包租的小公共汽车。汽车驶经朝阳区大北窑时，陈玉才装模作样地让大家拿出证件登记住宿，并向每人收取２０元“押金”。有人不愿交，陈玉才威胁道：“我们是刑满出来的，没有人管得了。你们上了车就等于上了贼船，赶快交钱，谁不交钱就拿谁开刀！”旅客们被迫交了钱。车到劲松松园旅馆后，有几个旅客见他们介绍的住处是地下室，便要求退钱。陈玉才等人拒不退款，坐上小公共汽车扬长而去。现在，陈玉才已被依法劳动教养２年，其他人也已被行政拘留，每人分别被罚款２００元。　　
    据了解，陈玉才等人自１９８７年即干起了这种“剪径”营生。１９８８年８月２１日，陈玉才用这一手段骗了一位台胞，被公安部门拘留了１５天。他出来刚３天，又重新作案。１１月中旬，北京市公共交通分局又拘留了一名叫张春生的不法分子，他是陈玉才等人的同伙。据一知情人透露，最近，他看见拘留期满出来的阎晓凤、张春生等人又在北京火车站“揽客”。
    目前，到北京火车站揽客的有３种人：一是经北京火车站地区管理处批准，有车接送旅客的旅馆服务员。他们一般比较规矩，但只占很少一部分。二是违章揽客的。为争夺客源，他们打着“代买火车票、飞机票”等幌子，招揽旅客。这批人每天达８００多人次。三是无业人员、刑满释放人员等。这伙人冒充旅馆服务员接站，绞尽脑汁敲诈旅客。他们鱼龙混杂，旅客稍不注意，就会上当受骗。北京火车站地区管理处的负责同志说，借“揽客”之机，敲诈勒索旅客的钱财，已成为一个值得注意的社会问题。
    北京火车站一伙“剪径客”为什么肆无忌惮地敲诈勒索旅客呢？
    首先，公安部门处理这种“剪径客”没有切实可行的法律依据。为了维护公共秩序，公安部门凡看到违章揽客的就罚就轰，但罚不胜罚，轰不胜轰，揽客的反而越来越多。久而久之，公安部门也难于应付，觉得这是件挠头的事情。对于那些抓到的“剪径客”，除陈玉才被劳动教养外，其余的却只能拘留半个月，罚款几百元了事。对于这种处理，这伙人根本不在乎。因此，他们从拘留所一出来，照样干起这种“剪径”勾当。
    二是现行的差旅费报销制度存在着漏洞。陈玉才等人向有关人员收取“手续费”后，便以废汽车票作为报销凭证。这也就是近两年来这伙人“剪径”生意兴隆，而报案人寥寥无几的原因之一。这次，陈玉才被抓后曾交待：“我干这一行已很久了，还是头一次碰到有人去报案。”许多上当受骗的旅客，有的因单位能报销“剪径客”给的废汽车票，自己不受损失也就算了；有的认为多一事不如少一事，自认倒霉罢了。北京火车站有关人员说，有的人凭借这种“营生”，一年挣万把块钱不成问题。
    三是小公共汽车的包车业务有弊端。目前，仅北京火车站就有８个车场的几十辆小公共汽车。这些小公共汽车既拉散客又允许包车。因此，一些“剪径客”就租用小公共汽车招揽旅客，在车上逼旅客就范。有的车场虽然规定不允许“揽客”的人包车，但有些司机借口事先不了解他们的身份，为了四五十元的包车费而动心。到目前为止，小公共汽车的司售人员还从未向公安部门报告有关“剪径客”的不法行为。
    对于解决集体和个体旅馆违章“揽客”的问题，北京市有关部门是重视的。北京火车站地区管理处和北京站地区公安分局曾多次建议有关部门设立一个介绍海淀区、丰台区、石景山区、朝阳区等地旅店的机构，配备人员管理这些地区的旅店。如果这样做了，加上公安部门的协助，违章揽客的现象就会大大减少甚至消失。那些依靠揽客为生的“剪径客”就会失去立足之地。
