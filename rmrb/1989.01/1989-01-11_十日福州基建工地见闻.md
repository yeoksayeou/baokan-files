The 10th was the deadline for the State Council's notice to halt construction on nine categories of projects. In the afternoon of that day, a reporter drove to Fuzhou to inspect several halted construction sites.

The Hualin Grand Building, standing at the southeast corner of Wusi Road and Hualin Road, has been built up to the 13th floor. This 20-story office and commercial complex, with a construction area of 20,000 square meters, was funded by the provincial branch of the Agricultural Bank of China with an investment of over 22 million yuan. When the reporter arrived at the site, the completed floors were surrounded by steel scaffolding and safety nets. A 40-meter-high yellow crane and a lift stood silently. The construction team from the provincial Sixth Construction Company had withdrawn over a month ago, leaving only a few workers to guard the site.

Heading west on Hualin Road, at the end of the road is the Xihu Hotel, under the jurisdiction of the provincial government affairs management bureau. About 20 meters inside the gate, on the north side, is the halted construction site for the reception hall. Within the area enclosed by several haphazardly placed wooden planks, the concrete framework of the first floor, already poured, is supported by a dense array of formwork.

An accompanying official from the Fuzhou Municipal Cleanup and Rectification Office, Old Chen, told the reporter that this was a "leader's project," falling under the 8th item in the State Council's notice. This 1,000-square-meter building, with an investment of 1.3 million yuan, had neither a construction permit nor a work order. When asked about the design of the reception hall, Old Chen was also unaware. However, this project was still under construction until January 4th. When the cleanup and rectification office came to inspect, workers were still pouring concrete. After criticism and intervention, construction stopped on January 5th.

In recent years, due to the need for construction, farmers' land has been requisitioned, and many farmers who have lost their land have pooled resources to build restaurants and inns in the city. Farmers, after much effort to gather funds, had just started construction when they encountered the cleanup and rectification campaign, forcing them to halt or delay their projects. The reporter visited the construction site of the Yuantian Hotel, funded by farmers with 18 million yuan. The 3,000-square-meter site had rusted main steel columns protruding from the foundation. Inside the compound, timber and formwork were neatly stacked into two small sheds. The empty construction site gave an impression of cleanliness and order, in stark contrast to the chaotic site of the Xihu Hotel reception hall. The farmers' approach to business, devoid of extravagance, was well-reflected in the halted construction of the Yuantian Hotel.

A year ago, farmers from Hongshan Township in the suburbs of Fuzhou raised funds to build a hot spring park. To make up for the losses, they raised another 60 million yuan to build a hot spring hotel. The plan was to use the profits from the hotel to cover the park's losses, and the municipal government approved it the previous year. Construction of the foundation was completed last year, but the project was halted due to the cleanup and rectification campaign. The hot spring hotel is a delayed project, and the farmers are in distress: "Once delayed, it will be three years! The park's losses won't be covered, and after three years, the 60 million yuan won't be enough to build the hotel!" However, the farmers still prioritized the bigger picture and halted construction after completing the foundation.

Driving past the provincial Commercial Bureau's comprehensive building site, the provincial Petrochemical Corporation's comprehensive building site, and reaching the sites of the provincial Construction Bank and Industrial and Commercial Bank buildings... everywhere the reporter went, all projects under cleanup were halted. Officials from the municipal cleanup and rectification office told the reporter that after seeing the State Council's notice in the newspaper, they acted accordingly. In recent days, a few projects seeking approval were denied because they lacked the "1989 National Fixed Asset Investment Plan" as required by the State Council. After the New Year, officials from the cleanup and rectification office inspected the sites of projects that should be halted or delayed. Except for a few projects, all had stopped construction. Those that had not stopped were criticized and then halted. The city has now halted or delayed 168 projects, with a total investment of 348 million yuan, effectively reducing investment by 121 million yuan.

### 十日福州基建工地见闻

　　十日福州基建工地见闻
    本报记者  张铭清
    １０日，是国务院通知９类项目先停工后清理的期限日。当天下午，记者驱车福州，察看了几个停建项目工地。
    矗立在五四路和华林路口东南角的华林大厦已建到１３层。这座由省农行投资２２００多万元的办公综合大楼，建筑面积２万平方米，计划建２０层。记者来到工地，只见已建成的十几层大楼被钢管脚手架和安全网包围着，４０多米高的黄色大吊车和升降机静静地矗立着。承建这一工程的省六建的施工队伍在一个多月前已经撤离，只留下几个值班工人“看家护院”。
    顺华林路西行，尽头便是省机关事务管理局所辖西湖宾馆，进大门约２０米，便见北侧已停工的会见厅工地。在几块横七竖八的木板围起来的场地上，已经浇好水泥的一层框架下面，密密麻麻地顶着模板支撑。
    同行的福州市清理整顿办的老陈告诉记者，这是个“首长工程”，属于国务院通知９项中的第８项。这一建筑面积１０００平方米，投资１３０万元的工程，既没有开工报告，也没有下施工任务书，所以问及会见厅的式样，老陈也不得而知。可这个工程直到１月４日还在施工。当清理整顿办的同志来检查时，工地上正忙着浇水泥，经过批评、制止，到１月５日才停止施工。
    近年来，因为建设需要征用了农民的土地，市郊一些失去了土地的农民也纷纷集资进城办饭店、开旅社。农民好不容易集够了资，刚刚上马兴建，便遇上了清理整顿，只好停建缓建。记者来到广达路农民集资１８０万元兴建的园林饭店工地。只见３０００平方米建筑面积的场地上，两米多高生锈的主柱钢筋一根根静静地戳在桩基承台上。围墙内侧，木料、模板井然有序地码成两座小屋。空荡荡的工地，给人以干净整齐的印象，与西湖宾馆会见厅工地的杂乱形成鲜明的对照。农民办事业，鲜有大手大脚的大少爷作风，他们那种勤俭节约的做法在停建的园林饭店工地上得到很好的体现。
    福州市郊的洪山乡农民，一年前筹资建了个温泉公园。为了补亏，他们又集资６００万元，准备建一座温泉旅社。打算用旅社赚的钱补公园的亏损，市府前年就批了。去年才打好地基，遇上清理整顿。温泉旅社属于缓建项目，农民叫苦不迭：“这一缓就是３年哇，公园亏损补不上不说，３年后这６００万就不够建旅社了呀！”但，农民还是顾全大局，打好了地基就歇了手。
    车过中山路省商业厅综合大楼工地，经省石油公司综合大楼工地，到省建行、工商行大楼工地……所到之处，凡是在清理之列的项目都已停工，市清理整顿办的同志告诉记者，在报纸上看到国务院通知后，就按通知办了。近几天，有几家要求批项目的，因为没有国务院规定的“１９８９年国家下达的固定资产投资计划”手续，一个也没有批。元旦后，清理整顿办的同志分头到应该停缓建项目工地上检查了一遍，除个别项目外，都已停工，没停工的经批评也停下来了。全市现已停缓建１６８项，总投资３．４８亿元，实际压缩投资达１．２１亿元。
