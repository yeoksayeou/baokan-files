Today, Wang Jiarui, Director of the Postal Publication Circulation Bureau of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, reported to a reporter on the nationwide publication circulation situation: Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, the number of publication types this January has not decreased, but the circulation has dropped by 32.5%.

At the end of last year, the total number of publications (excluding Taiwan Province and Hong Kong and Macau) distributed by post was 4,031, and this year it is 3,996. Additionally, there are more than 200 self-distributed publications, increasing the total number of types compared to last year.

In January of this year, the nationwide postal distribution of newspapers was 78.8 million copies per issue, and periodicals were 92.3 million copies per issue, both of which decreased by 33.4% and 31.6% respectively compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Compared to the same period last year, the total circulation of publications in January this year decreased by 39.2%.

According to statistics from the Publication Circulation Bureau, the top three nationwide newspapers with the highest circulation in January this year were: *People's Daily*, *Workers' Daily*, and *China Youth Daily*. The nationwide major newspapers with the highest decrease in circulation reached 38%.

The top three key periodicals with the highest circulation in January this year were: *Half-Monthly*, *Seeking Truth*, and *China Youth*. Compared to the end of last year, they decreased by 27.7%, 40.7%, and 36% respectively. The periodical with the least decrease was *Outlook*, which decreased by 16.7%.

According to the reporter's understanding, the main reasons for the decrease in publication circulation are the adjustment of publication prices and the reduction of public expenditure on subscriptions. Additionally, the late implementation of the publication price adjustment policy and the periodic decrease in publication circulation at the beginning of each year are also factors.

According to a responsible person from the relevant department of the Press and Publication Administration, this nationwide decrease in publication subscriptions, although it has put some pressure on the economic situation of some publication houses and has had some impact on propaganda work, it has a positive effect on improving publication quality, adjusting publication structure, easing paper shortages, promoting competition among publications, and encouraging the survival of the fittest. At the same time, it also prompts publications to further strengthen and improve their circulation work.

　　今年全国报刊品种未减  期发数下降近三分之一
    本报北京１月２６日讯  记者周庆报道：今天，邮电部报刊发行局局长王家瑞向记者介绍了全国报刊发行情况：与去年第四季度相比，今年１月份报刊品种未减，期发数下降３２．５％。
    去年底，全国（台湾省和香港、澳门除外）邮政发行报刊４０３１种，今年为３９９６种，另有自办发行２００多种，品种比去年增加。
    今年１月份全国邮政发行的报纸，每期发行数为０．７８８亿份，刊物为０．９２３亿份，分别比去年第４季度下降３３．４％和３１．６％。与去年同期相比，今年１月份报刊期发总数下降３９．２％。
    据报刊发行局统计，今年１月份全国性大报期发数居前３位的是：《人民日报》、《工人日报》和《中国青年报》。全国性主要报纸期发数下降最高的达３８％。
    今年１月份全国性重点发行刊物期发数居前３位的是：《半月谈》、《求是》和《中国青年》。它们比去年底分别下降２７．７％、４０．７％和３６％。下降较少的是《瞭望》，下降了１６．７％。
    据记者了解，报刊期发数下降的原因，主要是报刊调价和压缩公费订报开支。另外，也和报刊调价政策出台较晚、每年年初报刊期发数周期性下降有关。
    据新闻出版署有关部门负责人分析，这次全国性报刊订数下降，虽使一些报刊社在经济上承受压力，对宣传工作有一定影响，但对提高报刊质量、调整报刊结构、缓解用纸紧张，促进报刊间的竞争和优胜劣汰，有积极作用。同时，也促使报刊进一步加强和改进发行工作。
