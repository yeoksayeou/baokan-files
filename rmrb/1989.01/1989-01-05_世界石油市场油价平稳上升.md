Title: Oil Prices Steadily Rise in the Global Market

The first trading day of 1989 at the New York Mercantile Exchange was bustling with activity after the quiet of the New Year's holiday. The most notable development was in the crude oil market, where many traders were eager to buy February futures contracts. Prices rose steadily from the holiday period: West Texas Intermediate crude oil increased from $17.25 to $17.35 per barrel, North Sea Brent crude oil rose from $15.80 to $16.45 per barrel, and Saudi Arabia's light crude oil went from $13.00 to $13.40 per barrel.

The steady rise in global oil prices comes as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) begins to implement its new production cut agreement. Oil traders and industry professionals are closely monitoring OPEC's actions, particularly whether the organization will adhere to its agreement to limit daily oil production to no more than 18.5 million barrels in the first half of the year. Currently, the agreement appears to be on track. Saudi Arabia, OPEC's largest oil producer, has notified some foreign clients that it will reduce supplies by 40% starting this year. Another key oil producer, Kuwait, has also informed all its clients that the amount of oil they can lift in the first quarter will not exceed contractual limits. Iraq, which is participating in OPEC's production cut agreement for the first time in two years, began reducing exports on January 1 and pledged to adhere to the agreement. The United Arab Emirates, which had the highest overproduction rate in the past, began cutting production at the beginning of the month and stated its intention to comply with the new quota assigned to the country. Other OPEC member states have also expressed their commitment to adhering to production limits.

The trend in oil prices for the first half of the year is a major concern for both buyers and sellers in the New York Mercantile Exchange's oil futures market. Opinions within the oil industry are divided, with some predicting a weak market and others expecting a strong one. However, most analysts believe that oil prices will rise moderately, averaging around $16 per barrel. The reasoning is that current global oil inventories are lower than in the past, with total inventories only slightly exceeding normal levels by about 100 million barrels. Additionally, given the relatively strong economic conditions in Western industrialized countries in 1989, the average daily demand for OPEC oil in the first half of the year is expected to be around 20 million barrels. If OPEC can effectively reduce its daily production from 23.1 million barrels in December 1988 by approximately 20%, it can gradually reverse the oversupply situation in the oil market and achieve a basic balance between supply and demand.

### 世界石油市场油价平稳上升

　　世界石油市场油价平稳上升
    本报记者  刘开宸
    今天是纽约商品交易所一九八九年开市的第一天。在前两天元旦假日的宁静后，交易所大厅里恢复了平时熙熙攘攘的热闹场面。最引人注意的是，原油交易，许多人抢着买二月份期货，价格比假日前稳步上升：美国标准原油——西得克萨斯中质油从每桶十七点二五美元涨到十七点三五美元，英国北海布伦特原油从十五点八○美元涨到十六点四五美元，沙特轻质油从十三美元涨到十三点四○美元。
    世界石油市场价格的平稳上升，是在石油输出国组织（欧佩克）开始执行新的限产协议之时。此间石油商人和石油工业界人士仍在密切注视和研究欧佩克的动向，重点是欧佩克是否真正执行在今年上半年内每天石油产量不得超过一千八百五十万桶的协议。目前看来，协议执行情况尚好。欧佩克最大的石油生产国沙特已通知一些外国客户，从今年一月起减少供油百分之四十。另一个重要石油生产国科威特也已通知所有客户，今年第一季度的提油量不得超过合同的规定。两年来第一次参加欧佩克限产协议的伊拉克从本月一日起开始减少出口，并保证遵守协议。过去，超产比率最大的阿联酋，已在本月初开始减产，并表示要遵守协议对该国的新配额。欧佩克的其他国家也纷纷表示遵守生产限额。
    今年上半年的油价趋势是纽约商品交易所石油期货买卖双方最关心的问题。石油界人士的意见并不一致。有人预测油价疲软，有人估计油价坚挺。但是，大部分人士认为，油价可望有节制地上升，平均油价将在每桶十六美元左右。理由是，目前世界石油的库存量比过去减少，总库存量只比正常的超过一亿桶左右。同时，由于一九八九年西方工业国家经济情况尚好，世界石油市场在一九八九年上半年平均每天对欧佩克石油的需求量可达二千万桶左右。只要欧佩克切实将它们一九八八年十二月间二千三百一十万桶的日产量减少约百分之二十，就可逐渐扭转石油市场供过于求的局面，使供求基本平衡。
