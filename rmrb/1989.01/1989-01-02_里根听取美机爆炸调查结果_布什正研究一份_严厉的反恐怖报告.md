Reagan Receives Report on U.S. Plane Explosion Investigation
Bush Studying a "Severe Anti-Terrorism Report"

	Washington, December 29 (Reported by Cang Lide) — After learning that a bomb explosion caused Pan Am Flight 103 to crash, killing all aboard, the U.S. government today vowed to spare no effort in identifying the perpetrators and their motives. State Department spokesman Charles Redman also said that the U.S. will adopt stricter security checks at airports and for passengers.

	President Reagan today received a report on the cause of the Pan Am Flight 103 crash while vacationing in California. The FBI director stated that regardless of whether the perpetrators acted out of terrorist or criminal motives, the bureau will thoroughly investigate every detail of the incident.

	According to reports, among the 258 victims on Flight 103 (including 15 crew members), the first batch of 5 bodies has been transported from the United Kingdom to New York. Some American families of the victims have demanded retaliation against the perpetrators of this terrorist act.

	Xinhua News Agency, Washington, December 31 — U.S. President Reagan said today that President-elect George Bush is currently studying a report on anti-terrorism that is "the strongest in tone to date," calling for "tough measures," including military action, against terrorists.

	Reagan warned that the report should be "enough to keep some people awake from now on."

　　里根听取美机爆炸调查结果
    布什正研究一份“严厉的反恐怖报告”
    本报华盛顿１２月２９日电  记者仓立德报道：在得悉一枚炸弹爆炸造成泛美航空公司１０３航班机毁人亡后，美国政府今天保证，将竭尽全力查清这一悲剧的制造者及其动机。国务院发言人奥克利还表示，美国将对机场和乘客登机程序采取更为严格的安全检查措施。
    里根总统今天在加利福尼亚州休假地听取了１０３航班失事原因的调查结果汇报。联邦调查局局长表示，不管破坏者是出于恐怖动机还是犯罪动机，该局将深入调查这一事件的每个细节。
    据报道，在１０３航班２５８名全部遇难者（包括１５名机组人员）中，第一批５具尸体已从英国运抵纽约。一些美国遇难者家属要求对制造这一恐怖活动的破坏者施加报复。
    新华社华盛顿１２月３１日电　美国总统里根今天说，总统当选人乔治·布什目前正在研究一份在反恐怖主义方面“迄今为止措辞最为严厉的报告”，该报告要求对恐怖主义分子采取包括军事行动在内的“强硬措施”。
    里根警告说，上述这份报告应该“足以使某些人从现在起就睡不着觉”。
