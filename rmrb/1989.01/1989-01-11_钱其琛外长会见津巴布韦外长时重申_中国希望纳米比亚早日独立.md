Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen met with Zimbabwean Foreign Minister Shamuyairela in Paris today. Qian said that China is prepared to discuss with non-aligned countries and the United Nations Security Council to alleviate the situation caused by the possible reduction of military personnel in the UN mission responsible for implementing Resolution 435 on Namibian independence.

Qian said that the concerns of the frontline states in Africa are "understandable," but the UN's efforts to save expenses are also reasonable. However, it is essential to ensure the full and effective implementation of Resolution 435, so that the UN mission can truly play its role in achieving Namibia's independence.

Qian said that for this reason, China is prepared to discuss with non-aligned countries and other members of the UN Security Council to find a solution that everyone can accept.

Qian also reaffirmed China's support for the just struggle of the people of Southern Africa, expressing the hope that Namibia can achieve independence as soon as possible.

Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen met with Zimbabwean Foreign Minister Shamuyairela in Paris today. Qian said that the conflict between African students and Chinese students at Nanjing University will not affect the friendly cooperative relationship between China and Africa.

Foreign Minister Qian reiterated that the Nanjing University incident was an isolated event with no connection to racial discrimination. He said that the issue is being resolved appropriately and that this incident will not affect the traditional friendship between the Chinese and African peoples.

　　钱其琛外长会见津巴布韦外长时重申
    中国希望纳米比亚早日独立
    新华社巴黎１月９日电  中国外长钱其琛今天在巴黎会见津巴布韦外长沙穆亚里拉时说，中国准备同不结盟国家和联合国安理会再次商谈，以便缓解因联合国使团负责执行关于纳米比亚独立的４３５号决议的军事人员可能减少而形成的局势。
    钱其琛说，非洲前线国家在这方面的忧虑是“可以理解的”，但联合国节省经费的作法也是合理的，但与此同时要确保４３５号决议的全面有效实施，使联合国使团起到真正的作用，以实现纳米比亚的独立。
    钱其琛说，正是出于这种考虑，中国准备同不结盟国家和联合国安理会其他成员商谈，以便找到一个大家都可以接受的办法。
    钱其琛还重申了中国支持南部非洲人民正义斗争的立场，中国希望纳米比亚尽快取得独立。
    新华社巴黎１月９日电　中国外长钱其琛今天在巴黎会见津巴布韦外长沙穆亚里拉时说，南京校园非洲学生和中国学生的冲突不会影响中国和非洲的友好合作关系。
    钱外长再次声明，南京校园冲突是一件孤立的事件，和种族歧视没有任何联系。他说，问题正在合理解决，这次事件不会影响中非人民传统友谊。
