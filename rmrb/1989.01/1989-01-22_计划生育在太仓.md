Early this month, reporters first arrived in Taicang County and noticed that the streets and shops were relatively empty, with a clean and quiet environment. It is said that Jiangsu has a dense population, but why is it hard to see crowded people in Taicang? The deputy director of the Taicang County Family Planning Commission, Yuan Bingxing, answered our questions.

Yuan Bingxing introduced that Taicang County has a good economic and cultural foundation, and the masses are relatively easy to accept new birth concepts. Family planning work began in the early 1960s. In 1968, the entire county conducted extensive and in-depth ideological mobilization among the masses, and the use of contraceptives was promoted. In the mid-1970s, according to the requirements of prioritizing the arrangement of the first child, strictly controlling the second child, and resolutely eliminating multiple births, the birth plan was arranged; in 1979, it began to universally advocate that a couple should have only one child. The county has insisted on family planning work for more than 20 years, achieving remarkable results. As early as 1971, Taicang became the first county in the country with a natural population growth rate of less than 10‰. Since then, the natural population growth rate of the entire county has remained relatively stable. The average natural growth rate in the first eight years of the 1980s was 2.55‰, and the family planning rate has been maintained at over 99% since 1983, with only one case of multiple births in five years. Although the country and the province have entered the third peak of childbirth, Taicang County's natural population growth rate in the past two years has not exceeded 6‰, and the concept of having fewer but better children has basically become the masses' conscious will.

Due to the persistent efforts in family planning work, Taicang County's population growth rate has been significantly slowed down. The county's population was 405,000 in 1970 and 443,000 in 1988, an increase of only 38,000 in 18 years. According to the 1970 birth rate, the county reduced 75,000 births in 18 years. Otherwise, this would have been a heavy burden!

The early and effective implementation of family planning work has brought many benefits to Taicang County. Its per capita national income ranks among the top in the province. In 1987, the county's gross national product was 1.008 billion yuan, national income was 887 million yuan, per capita income was 2,101 yuan, and the per capita distribution level of farmers was 920 yuan. In Jiangsu Province, Taicang County is one of the counties with fast-growing per capita national income, slow population growth, and more per capita arable land. Compared with 1978, the county's gross national product increased by 4.1 times, population increased by 2.35% (the province increased by 8.80% in the same period), farmers' per capita distribution increased by 5.2 times, and per capita arable land area was maintained at 1.5 mu, higher than the provincial average of 1.1 mu. Meanwhile, the county's education cause has developed rapidly, with a primary school enrollment rate reaching 100%. The number of middle and primary schools, students, and in-service teachers, calculated per capita, also ranks among the top in the province. Here, the population, economy, education, and society are in harmony.

The comrades in Taicang County believe that the fundamental issue of implementing family planning is to change the birth concept. They have always put propaganda and education in the first place, taking the improvement of the masses' awareness and the dissemination of family planning knowledge as the main content of propaganda and education. Their goal is to avoid fines among couples of childbearing age. To this end, a large number of grassroots cadres and medical staff have done a lot of hard, patient, and meticulous work. The family planning department of Taicang County has gradually established a system to popularize family planning scientific knowledge through several years of exploration, initially forming a teaching and guidance service network, which is well received by couples of childbearing age.

The main contents of this activity are: necessary knowledge in the aspects of premarital health, optimal childbearing, prenatal care, contraception, scientific child-rearing, and maternal and child health. Taicang County mainly disseminates these knowledge through four channels. First, implement segmented teaching, gradually teaching systematic scientific knowledge to the masses, mainly using video screenings and consultation services. Second, distribute knowledge cards. Taicang County Family Planning Commission has compiled seven types of knowledge cards, including "Premarital Knowledge," "Prenatal Care," and "Early Childhood Education." Third, establish a mother-child system management system with "Mother-Child Health Handbook" as the main content, closely integrating family planning with maternal and child health. Fourth, rely on workers, youth, women, and other mass organizations and cultural, educational, and broadcasting departments to make the popularization of family planning scientific knowledge multi-channel and regular. The practices of Taicang County adapt to the masses' requirements for having fewer but better children, and have been welcomed by the masses.

　　计划生育在太仓
    本报记者  李济国  孙健
    本月上旬，记者初到太仓县城，看到街上和商店里，来来往往的人群明显稀疏，环境既整洁又安静。都说江苏人口密集，怎么在太仓难得见到拥挤的人群呢？太仓县计划生育委员会副主任袁炳兴解答了我们的疑问。
    袁炳兴介绍说，太仓县的经济文化基础较好，群众较易接受新的生育观念，计划生育工作早在６０年代初就开始了。１９６８年全县在群众中进行了广泛深入的思想动员，服用避孕药得到推广。７０年代中期，按照优先安排一胎、严格控制二胎、坚决杜绝多胎的要求安排生育计划；１９７９年开始普遍提倡一对夫妇只生育一个孩子。全县坚持２０多年的计划生育工作，取得了明显的效果。早在１９７１年，太仓就成为全国第一个人口自然增长率降到１０‰以内的县。从此，全县人口自然增长率一直比较稳定。８０年代的前８年平均自然增长率为２．５５‰，１９８３年以来的计划生育率均保持在９９％以上，５年中只出现一个多胎生育。尽管全国全省进入了第三个生育高峰，太仓县近两年人口自然增长率也没有超过６‰，少生优生已基本上成为群众的自觉意愿。
    由于坚持不懈抓了计划生育工作，太仓县人口增长速度大大放慢，全县人口１９７０年为４０．５万人，１９８８年为４４．３万人，１８年中总共才增加３．８万人。按１９７０年生育水平推算，全县１８年少出生了７．５万人。否则，这将是一个多么沉重的负担！
    计划生育工作抓得早抓得好，给太仓县带来了诸多好处。它的人均国民收入在全省名列前茅，１９８７年全县国民生产总值１０．０８亿元，国民收入８．８７亿元，人均２１０１元，农民人均分配水平９２０元。在江苏省，太仓县属于人均国民收入增长快，人口增长速度慢，人均耕地较多的县。与１９７８年相比，全县国民生产总值增长４．１倍，人口增长２．３５％（全省同期增长了８．８０％），农民人均分配提高了５．２倍，人均耕地面积保持在１．５亩，高于全省人均１．１亩的水平。与此同时，全县的教育事业得到迅速发展，小学的入学率达到１００％。所办的中小学、在校学生、在职教师，按人均计算排列，也居全省前列，这里的人口与经济、教育、社会协调发展。
    太仓县的同志认为，实行计划生育，最根本的问题是转变生育观念，他们始终把宣传教育放在首位，把提高群众的认识、传播计划生育知识作为宣传教育的主要内容。他们的目标是在育龄夫妇中不要出现罚款对象。为此，广大基层干部和医务人员做了大量艰苦、耐心、细致的工作。太仓县的计划生育部门通过几年摸索，逐渐建立了一套普及计划生育科学知识的制度，初步形成了教学和指导服务的网络，深受育龄夫妇欢迎。
    这项活动的教学内容主要是：新婚卫生、优生优育、孕期保健、节育避孕、科学育儿、妇幼保健等方面的必要知识，太仓县主要通过四条途径传播这些知识。第一，实施分段教学，将系统的科学知识逐步教给群众，主要利用放映录相、咨询服务方式。第二，发放知识卡片。太仓县计生委编印了“婚前须知”、“孕期保健”、“小儿早期教养”等７种知识卡片。第三，建立以“母子健康手册”为主要内容的母子系统管理制度，使计划生育与妇幼保健密切结合起来。第四，依靠工、青、妇等群众团体和文化、教育、广播等部门，使计划生育科学知识的普及工作多渠道、经常化。太仓县的这些做法，适应群众少生优生优育的要求，得到了群众的欢迎。
