Why must there be "conference meals" whenever a meeting is held?

Those with some years of experience say that in the 1950s, meals were provided at conferences mainly to solve the problem of meals for a few cadres who did not receive salaries. Each day, they would receive a subsidy of about two or three jiao, and at that time, everyone felt it was quite good. However, this has evolved into today's situation where people who receive salaries organize themselves to eat meals that have a somewhat "communist" flavor, which is quite contrary to the original intention.

If we say that providing "conference meals" had some "reasonable factors" in the past, then today's situation of extravagant meals at conferences is completely wrong.

With the excuse of holding a meeting, eating and drinking becomes justified, and the team is large. There will always be a part of people who are not really "participants" but still get to sit at the table. Once eating and drinking begins, it has to look decent, supposedly to "make everyone happy and work well when they return." In recent years, many places have tried holding meetings without providing meals, and so far, there has been no feedback of people not working well after returning. Now, all places where meetings are held have canteens, and the vast majority of participants receive salaries. It is advocated that everyone brings their own utensils and pays for their own meals. If it is said that this is very difficult or will make it impossible to hold the meeting, it is hard to convince people. This way, it is both hygienic and thrifty (in terms of money and time), and the garbage bins will not be overloaded, and the people will not have to shout "how can this be tolerated." Although this matter is a bit troublesome, if we think of the hundreds of billions of yuan of people's hard-earned money spent on this nationwide every year, we can remain calm and composed. Even for the few conferences where not providing meals is indeed not appropriate, we must oppose the practice of "primary stage" high-level eating and drinking.

　　提倡不办会议伙食
    郭宗阳
    开会为什么一定要办什么“会议伙食”？
    有点年纪的人讲：５０年代开会办伙食，主要是解决少数没工资的社队干部的吃饭问题，每天也就津贴那么两三角钱，当时都觉得很不错。演变成今日则是拿着工资而有组织地吃颇有点“共产主义”味道的高标准“会议伙食”，可谓大违初衷吧？
    如果说当初办“会议伙食”还有其“合理因素”的话，那么，时至今日形成会议大吃，实属大谬不然了。
    有了开会的口实，吃喝便名正言顺，队伍也庞大，总有一部分无论如何也算不上“与会者”的人叨陪末座。且一旦吃喝，便要像点样子，据说是“让大家高兴，回去好好工作”。近年来，不少地方都试过开会不办伙食，至今未见有回去不好好工作的“反馈”。现在所有的开会之所都有餐厅食堂，绝大多数与会者都有工资收入，提倡各人拿套餐具自己掏钱就餐，若说困难很大甚或会使会议没法开，是很难使人信服的。这样做，既卫生又节俭（金钱、时间），泔水桶亦保险无“超载”之虞，群众亦无须疾呼“怎么得了”，这事虽有点麻烦，但若想到全国每年为此消耗的数以百亿元计的人民血汗，也就心平气和了。就是少数确乎不办伙食不妥的会议，也一定要反对“初级阶段”高级吃喝的做法。
