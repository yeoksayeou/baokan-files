In the overseas Chinese hometown of Quanzhou City, Huitang County in southern Fujian, it is common to see groups of three or five women wearing yellow straw hats and flowered headscarves, dressed in short jackets and silver-trimmed trousers. These are the "Hui'an Women" depicted in the recently released film "The Widow Village."

For thousands of years, Hui'an Women have considered themselves as belonging to their parents, husbands, and children, losing their individuality in the process. They have only been expected to be filial daughters, virtuous wives, and good mothers. Some were betrothed in infancy, with child marriages and early marriages being very common. There was often a lack of love between husbands and wives, leading to frequent suicides and even collective jumping into the sea.

The spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has breathed new life into the barren land of Huitang, inspiring its 500,000 hardworking women. Recently, the author followed the footsteps of the Hui'an Women, visiting the eastern part of Huitang Island and the northern and southern parts of Huitang, and was deeply moved by what he saw and heard!

		The Hui'an Women Have Changed

Entering the eastern part of Huitang Island is like stepping into the "Land of Women" depicted in "The Flower Mirror." Here, most of the young and middle-aged men are out fishing or working, while the women take on the double burden of household chores and farm work. We saw over 2,000 women working hard to build the "Taiwan Fishermen's Shelter." They drove tractors back and forth, laughing like silver bells.

Over the past decade, the self-awareness of Hui'an Women has increased. They have risen up to resist the tragic fate imposed on them, consciously opposing child marriages and early marriages, breaking free from the spiritual shackles, and stepping onto the path of prosperity. The old tradition of men being the head of the household has been challenged, and many women have become the "boss" of their families. To master the skills of getting rich, many rural women have studied culture and technology, some traveling thousands of miles to learn from masters, and others hiring teachers at great expense.

With the improvement of women's cultural level, free love between men and women has gradually become the norm. At the entrance of cinemas, there are couples walking hand in hand; outside the ancient city walls, there are pairs of lovers; in the dance halls of hotels, disco music can be heard. The late-arriving Cupid has finally visited this forgotten corner of the sea.

		Women Have Opened the Path to Prosperity

Under the guidance of the policy of enriching the people, Hui'an Women have taken the stage of large-scale commodity economy in various fields as a powerful force. In Nanqing Township, we saw women gathered in courtyards, alleys, in front of houses, and behind houses, sewing and embroidering. The simple-patterned tablecloths, elegant-colored curtains, and meticulously embroidered handkerchiefs and napkins were dazzling and hard to put down. These embroidered products are popular in Japan, the United States, and more than a dozen countries and regions. In all 30 villages of the township, 28 villages have women participating in this embroidery and lace production. This product has an annual income of 800,000 yuan in processing fees alone. Currently, the township has become a provincial and municipal lace export production base.

In Luoyang Township's Cai Village, workshops and factories can be seen everywhere. In recent years, the village has set up 34 garment factories, almost employing all the female labor force in the village. Each laborer's annual income exceeds 4,000 yuan. With the accumulation of wealth, villagers have invested their money in setting up factories, expanding production, or building houses for future generations. No wonder even the elderly will say, "The women in our village have opened the path to prosperity."

		A Batch of Female Talents Has Emerged

In the ocean of commodity competition, a large number of female economic talents and female entrepreneurs have emerged in the overseas Chinese hometown. Huang Xiuyu from Jinfeng Village, Dongyuan Township, is one of them. She has a dark complexion and, from her appearance and attire, is a typical Hui'an rural working woman. She started with the "Jinfeng Shoe Factory." In late 1979, she established a family shoe factory, which was not doing well at the time. In 1986, when she returned from visiting relatives in Singapore, she did not bring back any items but brought back two large bags of shoe samples of various styles. Relying on her rich experience in studying shoe samples for many years, she drew the shoe patterns, and together with her son, they explored and developed, finally successfully producing the unique and novel "Spring and Autumn Shoes." This type of shoe won the favor of customers at the National Beidaihe Exhibition in the following year, and in October of the same year, at the National Shoe and Hat Professional Conference, she signed a purchase contract for 600,000 pairs with customers. Last year, at the Canton Fair, she signed a purchase contract for 1.5 million US dollars with foreign merchants.

Stone carving, which was once a male-dominated field, has now seen Hui'an Women entering the realm of stone carving art. Li Atou from Wufeng Village, Chongwu Town, established the county's first family stone carving factory in 1984, named "Zhenxing Stone Carving Factory," specializing in the production of stone carvings for export, such as stone lions, stone lanterns, stone tables and chairs, the Eighteen Arhats, the Eight Immortals Crossing the Sea, and the Twelve Zodiac Animals. The products are exported to Japan, the United States, France, and Southeast Asian countries, and have so far earned 2.1 million US dollars for the country. Under her influence, the entire village has set up 23 family stone carving factories. Just this stone carving industry earned 6 million yuan last year, increasing the per capita income from 200 yuan to over 1,200 yuan.

		"OK! Chinese Girls Are Great!"

The many female sculptors in Huitang Stone Carving Factory have amazed domestic and foreign tourists with their superb skills. Qingshi shadow carving newcomer Liu Bilan is one of them. In her hands, stubborn stones can be transformed into "living beings," and stones can be turned into magical treasures. She is skilled in carving aquatic products, and the works she creates, such as the lively shrimp and the leisurely snails, are almost lifelike. In July 1986, 72 countries' envoys to China visited the Huitang Stone Carving Factory and were immediately attracted by these vivid and lifelike shadow carvings, exclaiming, "OK! Chinese girls are great!"

In recent years, Liu Bilan has also carved statues for famous figures such as Corazon Aquino and Margaret Thatcher. Her art shadow carvings have participated in exhibitions in Japan, Singapore, West Germany, and Canada, and have been praised as "immortal art." Her works have been selected by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China as precious gifts.

Today, among the 129,000 people working in township and village enterprises in Huitang County, 97,000 are women. Last year, the total output value of township and village enterprises in the county was 230 million yuan, and the export earnings were 22.56 million yuan. Among these, women created an output value of 1.5 billion yuan and earned 13.68 million yuan in exports. Moreover, the county has more than 10,000 women working in the construction industry and contracting projects in Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and Xiamen, and 150 women have gone abroad for labor services.

　　今日“惠安女”
    黄维中
    在闽南侨乡泉州市惠安县，到处可见三五成群戴黄斗笠、花头巾，穿短上衣系银裤带的妇女，这就是最近上映的电影《寡妇村》中描写的“惠安女”。
    千百年来，惠安女把自己归属于父母、丈夫、子女，唯独丧失自我，只满足当个孝女、贤妻、良母；有的在襁褓中就被父母订了终身，童婚、早婚现象十分严重，夫妻间缺乏爱情基础，轻生自杀经常发生，集体跳海时有所闻。
    党的十一届三中全会精神的春风吹醒了惠安这块贫瘠的土地，感奋了５０万勤劳的惠安女。最近，笔者沿着惠安女的足迹，采访了惠东半岛和惠北、惠南等地，所见所闻，着实令人欣慰！
    　　　　惠安女变了
    进入惠东半岛，仿佛置身于《镜花缘》中描绘的“女儿国”。这儿的青壮男人，大多外出捕鱼、做工，女人则超负荷地包揽起家务、农活双重担子。我们看到２０００多名妇女为建设“台湾渔船避风港”在辛勤劳动。她们驾驶着拖拉机来往奔驰，甩下一串串银铃般的笑声。
    十年来，惠安女自我意识增强了。她们纷纷起来与强加于自己的悲惨命运抗争，自觉抵制童婚早婚，解除父母包办的娃娃婚约，冲破精神枷锁，走上社会，走上富裕的道路。这里男人当家的旧传统观念已受到一定的冲击，许多妇女成为家庭的“掌柜”。为了掌握致富本领，许多农村妇女学文化、学技术，有的千里迢迢拜师求艺，有的不惜重金自聘教师。
    随着妇女文化素质的提高，男女青年自由恋爱已逐步形成。在影剧院门口，出现结伴而行的情侣；在古城墙外滩，有相依相偎的倩影；在旅社宾馆的舞厅，响起了阵阵迪斯科音乐。姗姗来迟的爱神，终于光临这个被遗忘的海隅。
    　　　　妇女开通了致富路
    在富民政策的指引下，惠安妇女在各行各业中，以生力军的姿态登上大规模商品经济的舞台。在南誧乡，我们看到院落、埕头、房前、屋后，三五成群的妇女围坐一起，飞针走线，刺绣镶边。图案简练的台布、枕套，色彩素雅的窗帘、围裙，针工细致的手帕、餐巾，叫人眼花缭乱，爱不释手。这些刺绣产品畅销日本、美国和西欧等十几个国家和地区。全乡３０个村中就有２８个村的妇女参加这种刺绣抽纱生产，这项产品全乡年收入加工费可达８０万元。目前，该乡已成为省、市的抽纱出口生产基地。
    在螺阳乡蔡厝村，随处可见工棚、厂房。这个村近年来先后办起了３４家服装厂，几乎安排了村中所有女劳力，每个劳力的年均收入超过４０００元。村民有了积累，纷纷将资金入股办厂，扩大再生产，或建屋造厝，造福子孙。难怪连上了年纪的人都会叨念：“我们村妇女开通了致富路。”
    　　　　诞生了一批女能人
    在商品竞争海洋中，一大批经济女能人、女企业家在侨乡脱颖而出。东园乡锦丰村黄秀玉就是其中的一个。她肤色红黑，看外表那身装束，完全是个地地道道的惠安乡下劳动妇女。她是办“锦丰制鞋厂”起家的。１９７９年底创办，当时只是个家庭鞋厂，景气不佳。１９８６年她往新加坡探亲回国时，没有带回任何物品，却带回两大提包款式各异的样鞋。凭着多年悉心钻研鞋样的丰富经验，她描出鞋样，同她儿子共同探索、研制，终于试制成功了新颖独特的“春秋鞋”。这种鞋在第二年全国北戴河展销会上赢得顾客竞相订货，同年１０月在全国鞋帽专业会议上她一下子同顾客签订了６０万双的购销合同，去年在广交会上，又同外商签订了１５０万美元订货合同。
    石雕，本是男人的专利，如今惠安女也步入了石雕的艺术之宫。崇武镇五峰村妇女李阿尾，１９８４年创办了全县第一家家庭石雕厂，取名“振兴石雕厂”，专门生产供外贸出口的艺术石雕，如石狮子、石灯笼、石桌椅、十八罗汉、八仙过海、十二生肖等，产品远销日本、美国、法国及东南亚各国，至今已为国家创汇２１０多万美元。在她的带动下，全村办起了２３家家庭石雕厂，单石雕这项，去年就收入６００万元，年人均收入由２００元提高到１２００多元。
    　　　　“ＯＫ！中国姑娘了不起！”
    惠安石雕厂众多的女雕刻家，以她们卓绝的手艺，令国内外游客赞叹不已。青石影雕新秀刘碧兰就是其中的一个。在她那里，顽石能化为“有生之躯”，?石能变成神奇妙品。她擅长水鲜品的凿琢，作品中那活蹦乱跳的小虾，悠然自得的螺蛤，足以乱真。１９８６年７２个国家驻华使节参观惠安石雕厂时，立即被这生动传神的影雕所吸引，连声赞道：“ＯＫ！中国姑娘了不起！”
    近年来，刘碧兰还为科·阿基诺、撒切尔夫人等世界名人雕像。她的美术影雕多次参加在日本、新加坡、西德和加拿大等地的展览，被誉为“不朽的艺术”。她的作品被我国外交部选为贵重的礼品。
    如今，惠安县１２．９万乡、镇企业人员中，妇女就有９．７万多人。去年全县乡镇企业总产值２．３亿元、出口创汇２２５６万元，其中妇女创造的产值１．５亿元，创汇１３６８万元。不仅如此，全县还有一万多个妇女到深圳、珠海、厦门等地从事建筑行业和承包工程，有１５０个妇女劳务出口。
