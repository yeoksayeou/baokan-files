	Recently, a reporter investigated some families in Shanghai composed of disabled members and was deeply concerned about the living pressures and difficulties they face.

	(1) The divorce rate among disabled families is high. Disabled individuals face extreme difficulties in finding a partner. After much hardship, they finally establish their own families. However, the heavy household chores and economic and mental burdens often become unbearable, leading some to succumb to exhaustion and pass away midway through life. According to sample statistics, among the city's 450,000 disabled individuals of marriageable age, 30% have become widows or widowers. In contrast, the divorce rate among healthy individuals of marriageable age is only 6.55%.

	(2) The divorce rate among disabled families is frequent. It is understood that the current divorce rate in Shanghai is 0.59%. However, among every 100 disabled individuals of marriageable age in the city, 1.27 have lost their spouses due to divorce, with males accounting for 0.71% and females 0.56%. These disabled individuals who have experienced "marital changes" often rushed into marriage due to their physical disabilities, lacking a foundation of emotion and common language, ultimately leading to divorce.

	(3) A considerable number of families are composed entirely of disabled members, accounting for about 13% of disabled families. Since all members of these families have physical disabilities, they often engage in low-income work. Additionally, the daily medical expenses for both spouses are much higher than those of ordinary families, making their economic situation very tight.

	Disabled individuals are members of the larger societal family. Society has the responsibility and should extend a helping hand to their difficulties.

　　残疾人家庭有三难
    最近，记者调查了上海一些由残疾人组成的家庭，不禁为他们所面临的生活压力和困难而深深担忧。
    （一）残疾人家庭的丧偶比例高。残疾人在择偶极为困难的情况下，经过千辛万苦，终于有了一个自己的小家庭。但是，婚后沉重的家务劳作以及经济和精神上的负荷，往往使他们不堪负担，其中的一部分人终因心力交瘁，在人生的半道上撒手而去。据抽样统计表明，全市４５万多名２０岁以上的残疾婚龄人口中，有３０％的残疾者成了寡妇和鳏夫；而健全婚龄人口的丧偶率仅６．５５％。
    （二）残疾人家庭的婚姻裂变频繁。据了解，目前上海的离婚率为０．５９％。但是，全市每１００名残疾婚龄人口中，就有１．２７人因离婚而丧失自己的配偶，其中男性占０．７１％。女性占０．５６％。这些经历了“婚变”的残疾人，婚前大都因自己的生理缺陷，只要有对象就急于成婚，婚后，由于缺乏感情基础和共同语言，结果只能上法院，分道扬镳。
    （三）全部由残疾人组成的家庭占有相当高的数量，约占残疾人家庭的１３％左右。由于这些家庭的成员都有生理缺陷，他们从事的工作往往是经济收入较低的行当，而夫妇双方日常的医药费用又远比一般家庭高，因此经济十分拮据。
    残疾人是社会大家庭的一员，对他们的困难社会有责任也完全应该伸出援助之手。 　　　　（１９８９年１月３日《解放日报》　任炽越文）
