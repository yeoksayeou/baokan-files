To promote the development of the discipline of international political science in China, the Society for Cultural and Social Development Research, among other units, has edited the series "International Political Science Classics in Chinese Translation," which will be published by the People's Public Security University Press.

The "International Political Science Classics in Chinese Translation" series is compiled based on the principles of theoretical significance, authority, and comprehensiveness, selecting from hundreds of works by scholars from various countries around the world. The original authors of these works are mostly renowned scholars, such as Hans Morgenthau's "Politics Among Nations," Raymond Aron's "Peace and War," Karl Deutsch's "The Analysis of International Relations," Morton Kaplan's "System and Process in International Politics," Inis Claude's "Power and International Relations," and Robert Jervis's "Perception and Misperception in International Politics," which are foundational works in Western international political science. Robert Keohane and Joseph Nye's "Power and Interdependence," Dennis Pirro's "Global Political Economy," John Spanier's "Games Nations Play," and Robert Gilpin's "War and Change in World Politics" reflect the new trends in the development of contemporary international political science, covering the major schools of thought in the field of international politics today. This series consists of approximately thirty volumes, edited by Professor Zhou Jirong, a prominent scholar in the field of international political science in China.
