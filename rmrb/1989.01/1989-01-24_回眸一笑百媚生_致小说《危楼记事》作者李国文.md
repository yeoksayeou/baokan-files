A Glance Back Brings a Hundred Charms to Life
– To the Author of the Novel "The Tale of the Rickety Building," Li Guowen

Li Guowen,

Your magnum opus, "The Tale of the Rickety Building," has been published. Taking advantage of my editorial duties, I have thoroughly inspected your "rickety building," and only then did I appreciate its ingenious structure and exquisite craftsmanship. To be honest, when I previously skimmed through the windows and doors of your "rickety building" in fragments, I admired your humor, satire, absurdity, and critical abilities. You used a different style and effort from constructing "Garden Street No. 5" to build this "rickety building." However, because it is composed of several interconnected but independent short stories, each short story seems to be written randomly, "laughing, scolding, and writing articles," with little regard for the established novel structure. I was concerned that it would end up wherever it was built, lacking a complete blueprint. From a local perspective, there are brilliant elements, but from a global perspective, it might end up like the rickety building on S City's Y Street J Lane, appearing in a "twisted state." Thus, even the most talented strokes of genius could become mere playful scribbles. Now that your "rickety building" project is complete and delivered for readers, including myself, to enjoy, practice has shown that my concerns were unfounded. Your constructed "rickety building," like your "Garden Street No. 5" mansion, is solid, upright, and elegant, another beautiful piece of literary architecture.

Naturally, the "rickety building" has its unique charm. If the hallmark of your "Garden Street No. 5" mansion is the character "change," then this "rickety building" emphasizes the character "danger." You seem to first use the "rickety building" as a symbol of the "Cultural Revolution." That human catastrophe still makes one shudder. As you said, "Thinking about how we were always busy with petty squabbles, unaware that we were on a ship about to sink at any moment... it makes one's hair stand on end." Now, some people emphasize "looking forward" while intentionally or unintentionally ignoring looking back at it. However, this cannot be forgotten. You said well: "The rickety building is gone, but the aftertaste remains. The grand building is sturdy, but old habits die hard." The occurrence of the Cultural Revolution was not accidental; it had deep social and historical causes. However, the Cultural Revolution disaster has passed more than ten years, and although the early "scar literature" left some traces, overall, the achievements are not high. People are looking forward to a great work in this regard. Although we should not be too impatient, we should strive towards it. Your "rickety building" has made a powerful breakthrough in this regard, and it is a good breakthrough! Some comrades say, Li Guowen is a writer who faces life directly and embraces reality, known for writing about reform. Why does he "turn back" to write about the Cultural Revolution? In fact, you are "a glance back brings a hundred charms to life." Your "turning back" is precisely to delve deeper into the reform, needing to further eliminate the "aftertaste" and "old habits" of the Cultural Revolution. Your "The Tale of the Rickety Building" writes about both the past "inner and outer turmoil, chicken fights, and duck fights" of the "rickety building" and the present "the building is gone but the people remain," and "there are also those who, after waking up, still have daydreams." You have handled the past Cultural Revolution and the present reality in an integrated time-space treatment. Your reminiscence is not to escape reality, to reminisce for the sake of reminiscing, or to expose scars for self-entertainment. Your inability to forget is to fully excavate the experiences and lessons condensed in the past full of blood and tears, as a warning bell and as a treasure, to enlighten the present. Your direct confrontation with life and embrace of reality have not changed, but are "consistent." Your construction of this dilapidated "rickety building," raising the banner of "danger," and heavily coloring a sense of crisis and a sense of calamity, is precisely to further promote and develop the reform consciousness and spirit of change exhibited in that beautiful "Garden Street No. 5" mansion. This reflects your deeper experience of reality, and your concern for the soul of life has further stirred.

When it comes to depth, it should be emphasized that your "rickety building" symbol also points to the social and cultural mindset that caused the "Cultural Revolution." Therefore, writing about the "danger" of the "Cultural Revolution" is not about emphasizing the display of political turmoil, nor is it about political criticism, although these are also necessary. However, they generally belong to the surface and shallow levels. What you focus on is the social psychology and the soul of people, which delves into the hidden and deep levels of the "rickety building." "The Tale of the Rickety Building" has little "record" of the process and events of the Cultural Revolution, but rather carefully captures a spiritual atmosphere, letting the internal soul of the Cultural Revolution pulsate on the paper and occupy the "stage." The "danger" of your "rickety building" lies not only in the "twisted" state of "foundation sinking, leaning to the east and west," but also in the "twisted" state of "residents living in peace for so long, unaware of the danger." What is precious is that your revelation of this psychological and spiritual "twist" is not "a blow here, a blow there" in the nine short stories, grabbing whatever comes to hand, not "although it is a long piece, it is similar to short pieces"; but rather, it relatively well achieves "nine in one," with a call-and-response, organically presenting the complex and varied human faces and hearts, especially the human faces and hearts of the citizen society that few writers have explored. Comrade Lei Da once categorized the various characters in the "rickety building" according to their spiritual leading role into five categories: "endurance type," "resistance type," "bystander type," "hooligan type," and "cannibal type." I think this classification is generally appropriate. It is precisely through these representative spiritual groups that, as Lei Da said, you "examine how the national culture prepared the psychological soil for the Cultural Revolution, and how the Cultural Revolution further twisted the national psychology, as well as how this twisted mentality continues to this day, sharply conflicting with the trend towards modernization." You write about the demolition of the "rickety building," mainly to demolish that kind of national cultural psychology and national mentality long infiltrated by feudalism and ultra-leftist ideologies. You call on people not to be "numb and stupid," to have a sense of crisis. Your sharp statement about the negative aspects of our national spirit is not because you have become cold towards reality, but because you have a heart that loves the country and the people, and is eager for reform.

Guowen, precisely because you love the residents of the "rickety building" deeply and clearly see the "danger" of the "rickety building," your full passion and indignation cannot be poured out calmly according to the general novel method, but rather, you fuse allegory, science fiction, and strange tales into one, using realism, satire, absurdity, and commentary, sometimes crossing time and space, sometimes weaving past and present, real and unreal, true and false, dreamlike and not a dream... Here, you do not focus on the creation of typical characters in typical environments, but rather, you focus on spiritual phenomena, using the method of "criticizing evil often taking types" to let certain characters become carriers of certain cultural mindsets. Here, you do not fully display the descriptive means of the novel, but rather, narration is more important than description, often in direct expression of feelings, a sharp stab comes out horizontally. Here, you use laughter as a weapon, "tearing apart the worthless for people to see," using a mocking attitude to reveal absurd and painful things, which is also different from your past habit of writing "tragedies." Some people find it difficult to justify calling this a novel. I think this is still a kind of novel, a novel of mixed culture, or rather, the novel has become mixed culture. Look, "criticizing evil often taking types," wise words, fiery satirical edges, are not the main artistic features of modern miscellaneous prose created by Lu Xun? You introduce the methods of miscellaneous prose into the construction of the "rickety building," which is convenient for your emotional outpouring, convenient for your free reign, I think it enriches the novel form, is a kind of creation. For those who are not used to it or even dislike it for the time being, I believe they will soon change. Because novels can be scattered and poetized, mixed culture is not also good? Since current life is in a state of rapid change and turmoil, people have big emotions and feelings that need to be vented and shouted out immediately, the value of miscellaneous prose is on the rise. I think mixed culture novels will also have new developments. Perhaps I am ignorant, but I think your "rickety building" in contemporary long-form creation is the "first to do so," with pioneering significance. Naturally, mixed culture novels are still novels, criticism, satire, and criticism, etc., must be closely combined with the description of images. I think you will pay more attention to this point in the future development of this genre.

Best regards,

Zengpei

　　回眸一笑百媚生
    ——致小说《危楼记事》作者李国文
    江曾培国文兄：
    大著《危楼记事》已成书问世，乘编辑工作之便，我完整地参观了您的“危楼”，始领悟它的结构之巧，营造之妙。老实说，先前当我零碎地浏览“危楼”的一窗一户时，我虽叹服您的幽默、讽刺、荒诞、评议才能，能用不同于营造《花园街五号》工程的另一种笔墨，另一种功夫，建造这幢“危楼”，但因为它是由几个相连而又独立的中短篇组成，每一个中短篇又似乎是随意浑洒，“嬉笑怒骂，皆成文章”，很少顾及既定的小说章法，我担心它造到哪里是哪里，缺乏完整的蓝图，从局部上看，有闪光的东西，从整体来看，则可能就像Ｓ市Ｙ大街Ｊ巷的那座危楼那样，呈现出“扭曲状态”。如此，富有才华的神来之笔，也会沦为游戏笔墨。现在，当您的“危楼”工程已经全部完成，并且交付包括我在内的读者享用时，实践表明我的担心是多余的。您营造的“危楼”，如同您营造的那幢“花园街五号”的“洋房”一样，是坚固的，挺拔的，风姿绰约的，是又一座漂亮的文学“建筑物”。
    自然，“危楼”有“危楼”的特有风采。如果说，您那座“花园洋房”的标志是个“改”字，那么这幢“危楼”则是极力渲染一个“危”字。您似乎首先是把“危楼”作为“文化大革命”的一个象征。那场人间浩劫，想想还令人后怕。正如您所说，“想到我们原来成天忙于七斗八斗，却不知身处随时有灭顶之灾的沉船之上……不禁头皮发炸。”现在，有些人在强调“向前看”的时候，却有意无意地忽视向后看一看它。然而，这是不能忘却的。您说得好：“危楼去矣，余韵犹存，大厦虽健，旧习难泯。”“文革”的发生不是偶然的，有着深刻的社会的历史原因。可是，文革灾难已经过去十余年了，虽有早年的“伤痕文学”潮流留下了一些痕迹，但总的说来，成就不高，人们期待着这方面的大作品问世。尽管我们不应要求过急，但总要心向往之，努力去实践。您的“危楼”在这方面作了一个有力的冲杀，冲杀得好！有同志说，李国文是位直面人生、拥抱现实的作家，以写改革著名，怎么又“回过头去”写“文革”呢？实际上，您是“回眸一笑百媚生”。您的“回头”，正是着眼于深入改革，需要进一步清除“文革”的“余韵”与“旧习”。您的《危楼记事》，就是既写了当年“危楼”的“内外折腾，鸡争鹅斗”，又写了今天“危楼不在人在”，“也有醒了以后，照旧做白日梦的人。”您把当年“文革”与今天现实“作了一体化的时空处理”。您的回顾不是为了逃避现实，为回顾而回顾，不是揭揭疮疤而自娱。您的不能忘却，是为了把充满血与泪的往事中凝聚的经验与教训，充分发掘出来，作为警钟，作为财富，以启今人。您的直面人生、拥抱现实的品格没有变，而是“一以贯之”。您营造这座窳败的“危楼”，祭起“危”的旗帜，浓笔重彩地渲染一种危机感，一种忧患意识，正是为了进一步推进与发展那幢漂亮“花园洋房”中所展现的改革意识，变革精神。这反映了您对现实有了深一层的体验，您关注人生的灵魂有了进一步的骚动。因此，我以为《危楼记事》在笔调上虽较《花园街五号》幽默、轻松，内含上却是更为深沉。
    说到深沉，应该着重指出，您的“危楼”象征，更是指向造成“文化大革命”的社会文化心态。因此，想写“文化大革命”的“危”，不是着重于展现政治的动乱，不是着意于政治的批判，尽管这一切也是必要的，但一般属于显层次、浅层次的东西，您紧紧盯住的却是社会心理与人的灵魂，这就钻进“危楼”的隐层次、深层次了。《危楼记事》对“文革”的过程，事件的始终，少有“记”者，而是精心捕捉一种精神气氛，让“文革”内在灵魂的波动跃然纸上，占据“前台”。您的“危楼”之“危”，既在于“地基下沉，东倒西歪”之类的“扭曲”，更在于“居民习久为安，竟不觉险之为险”的“扭曲”。可贵的是，您对这种心理与灵魂的“扭曲”的揭示，在九个中短篇中，不是“东一榔头，西一榔头”，抓到什么是什么，不是“虽云长篇，颇同短制”；而是较好地实现了“九合一”，前呼后应，有机地呈现了纷繁复杂的人相与心相，特别是还少有作家问津的市民社会的人相与心相。雷达同志曾将“危楼”中形形色色的人物，按精神的主导作用，归纳为五大类别，即“忍从类”、“抗争类”、“看客类”、“流氓类”和“噬人类”，我认为这一划分大致是恰当的。正是通过这些有代表性的精神群体，如雷达所说，您“考察民族的文化心理怎样为‘文革’准备了心理土壤，而‘文革’又怎样使民族心理进一步恶变，以及这种扭曲心态延续至今，怎样与走向现代化的趋向尖锐冲突着。”您写“危楼”的拆除，最主要的，也是要拆除那种如封建主义与极左思潮所长期浸淫的民族文化心理与国民心态。您呼吁人们在这方面不要“麻木不仁和迟钝愚顽”，要有危机意识。您这种对我们民族精神负面的痛切陈述，不是由于您对现实有了冷漠，而是因为您跳动着一颗爱国爱民、急切改革的热烈的心。
    国文兄，正由于您对“危楼”中居民爱得深切，又对“危楼”之“危”看得分明，致使您饱满的激情、激愤，不能从容地按着一般小说作法倾泻，而是将寓言体、科幻体、志异体熔为一炉，写实、讽刺、荒诞、议论并用，时而时空交叉，时而今昔交织，虚虚实实，真真假假，似真似幻，是梦非梦……这里，您并没有精心于典型环境中典型人物的塑造，而是专注于精神现象，用“砭锢弊常取类型”的办法，让某些人物成为某种文化心态的载体。这里，您也没有充分展示小说的描绘手段，而是叙述重于描绘，往往在直抒胸臆中，横出辛辣的一刺。这里，您以笑为武器，“将无价值的撕破给人看”，用调侃的态度表露荒唐、痛苦的事情，与您过去惯于写“正剧”的风格也有所不同。有人觉得这难于名正言顺地说是小说。我以为，这仍是小说的一种，是杂文化的小说，或者说，小说杂文化了。您看，“砭锢弊常取类型”，富有智慧的言谈，烈火似的讽刺锋芒，不正是鲁迅所创造的现代杂文的几个主要艺术特征吗？您将杂文的手法引入“危楼”的营造，便于您的感情喷吐，便于您纵横驰骋，我以为它丰富了小说文体，是一种创造。对此，一时不习惯以至看不惯的人，我相信会很快转变的。因为，小说既然可以散文化、诗化，杂文化不也很好吗？由于当前的生活正处于急剧的变革与动荡之中，人们有大情大感需要及时地宣泄、呼喊，杂文行情正在看涨。我想，杂文化的小说也将会有新的发展。也许我孤陋寡闻，我以为您的“危楼”在当代长篇创作中，是这方面的“始作俑者”，具有开拓的意义。自然，杂文化的小说毕竟还是小说，评议、讽刺、针砭等等，要和形象的描绘紧紧结合在一起。我想，您在今后发展这一文体中，会更加重视这点的。
