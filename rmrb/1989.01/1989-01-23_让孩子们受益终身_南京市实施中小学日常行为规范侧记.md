It is often said that students should have the demeanor of students. What should students be like? Officials from the Nanjing Municipal Education Bureau told reporters: The daily behavior norms for primary and secondary school students issued by the State Education Commission last September are the standard.

	One relies on training, the other on management

	Implementing the daily behavior norms for primary and secondary school students is not difficult if one relies solely on mass meetings and a few activities. However, it is very likely to become a mere formality. How can one see real results?

	Habits are a person's second nature. Good behavior norms for students are not achieved through lectures but are cultivated. Only through sustained and repeated training and strict, meticulous management, day after day, month after month, can they become "automatic." Many schools start by focusing on the basics. As soon as new students enter the school, they are trained in various aspects according to the norms: how to enter the school gate, how to enter the teacher's office, how to assemble and line up, etc., all are part of the training until the desired results are achieved. One school spent three months just on not littering, and a semester on not spitting on the ground, until there were fewer paper scraps and no spit marks, before moving on to another project. Some classes at Beijing Donglu Primary School have developed good habits, and no longer need to clean the classroom every day.

	Some students' bad habits, or even vices, cannot be corrected by reasoning alone and must be supplemented with strict management. The 24th Middle School divided the daily behavior norms for middle school students into 14 items and scored them based on their implementation. The school evaluated the classes, and the classes evaluated the individuals, creating a competitive atmosphere of mutual pursuit.

	The environment has an irreplaceable effect on a person's emotions and behavior. Nanjing's primary and secondary schools generally focused on beautifying the school environment, striving to make students feel as soon as they enter the campus: behavior must be regulated, and one cannot be uncivilized.

	The charm of psychology

	The implementation of daily behavior norms for primary and secondary school students has created a small but significant "psychology craze" in Nanjing's middle schools. Teachers from the Psychology Research Office of the Normal University and experts from the Mental Hospital have become popular figures on campus. Humans are the most intelligent beings, but how many people lack an understanding of themselves?

	Middle school students in the 1980s not only need the guidance of teachers but also need respect and understanding. Some middle schools in Nanjing have set up principal mailboxes to listen to students' opinions on various aspects of the school's work. Critical comments are forwarded to the relevant departments; suggestions are responded to as satisfactorily as possible; controversial issues, such as hairstyles and tight pants, are discussed to enhance students' sense of participation.

	The 49th Middle School is located in the suburbs, and many students ride bicycles. At one time, many students rode bicycles inside the school and parked them haphazardly, causing disorder. Later, students were organized to participate in management, and they enhanced their awareness of accepting management while managing others. Now, bicycles are parked in an orderly manner in the school, making it a scenic spot.

	Students in school are not only recipients and absorbers but must also release their energy. Therefore, each school began to pay attention to letting students "divert their energy": Nanhu First Middle School let students publish their own weekly newspaper, saying what they want to say and discussing what they want to do; the 24th Middle School let students design hairstyles for middle school students... Students released their energy in these activities, and the rate of improper behavior significantly decreased.

	People have a desire to express themselves, and the desire of middle and primary school students is even more irrepressible. Nanjing's many middle and primary schools hold an annual arts festival and science week, providing a stage for students with talents to showcase their skills. The Third Middle School held personal art exhibitions and essay exhibitions for students with a certain level of skill, supporting students in excelling in their specialties.

	Advice to "First Teachers"

	Parents are the first teachers of their children. Almost every parent earnestly teaches their children to "study well," which is not a problem. However, how to achieve this goal is not something many parents know how to do. A seventh-grade girl from the 50th Middle School received the first letter from a boy and, in a state of panic and curiosity, replied. Her parents, who are officials, found out and kept questioning her, searching through her drawers and ordering her not to communicate. When she received the second and third letters inviting her out for a date, this girl, unable to control herself and fearing her parents would find out, secretly went out to meet. Children's emotions are pure, and after taking a puberty education class, she voluntarily opened her heart to the teacher, revealing her troubles. Later, based on the teacher's reasons, the problem was properly handled.

	The development of the times has also put forward new requirements for how to be a qualified parent. It is understood that the school's requirements for parents are roughly as follows: love children correctly, do not spoil or beat them; create a warm, harmonious, and democratic family atmosphere; set an example in words and deeds for children; encourage children to do household chores within their abilities; and closely cooperate with school education.

	It is reported that the Jiangsu Provincial Women's Federation is preparing to jointly organize a parent radio school with relevant departments. Undoubtedly, more parents will not only become their children's strict parents but also their good teachers and friends.

### 让孩子们受益终身——南京市实施中小学日常行为规范侧记

　　让孩子们受益终身   
    ——南京市实施中小学日常行为规范侧记
    本报记者  龚永泉
    常言道：学生要有学生的样子。学生应该是什么样子呢？南京市教育局的同志告诉记者：国家教委去年９月颁布的中小学生日常行为规范，就是标准。
    　　　　一靠训练　二靠管理
    贯彻中小学生日常行为规范，仅靠开大会动员，搞几个活动，并不难做到，但很可能走过场。如何才能见到实效呢？
    习惯是人的第二天性。学生良好的行为规范不是讲成的，而是养成的，只有通过持续反复的训练和严格缜密的管理，日积月累，才能“自动化”。不少学校首先从基础抓起，新生一进校，就按照规范要求进行多方面训练：如何进校门，如何进老师办公室，如何集合整队等，都在训练之列，直到抓出成效为止。有个学校光不乱丢纸屑，就抓了三个月，不随地吐痰抓了一个学期，直到纸屑少了、痰迹不见了，才转换另外的项目。北京东路小学有些班级的学生由于养成良好的习惯，已不需要天天打扫教室了。
    少数学生的不良行为习惯，甚至恶习，并不能仅靠说理教育就能矫正，还必须辅之以严格的管理。二十四中把中学生日常行为规范分解成１４个项目，根据执行情况给予打分，学校对班级，班级对个人，实行两级量化考核，形成了你追我赶的局面。
    环境对人的情绪和行为有不可低估的作用，南京中小学普遍抓了美化校园环境，努力使学生一步入校园就受到暗示：行为要有规范，不能不文明。
    　　　　心理学的魅力
    中小学生日常行为规范的实施，使南京各中学形成了一股不大不小的“心理学热”。师范大学心理教研室的教师、精神病院的专家成了校园内受欢迎的人物。人是万物之灵，但又有多少人缺乏对自身的了解啊。
    ８０年代的中学生不仅需要老师的教诲，还需要尊重和理解。南京一些中学设立校长信箱，听取学生对学校各项工作的意见。属于批评性的，向有关部门转达；属于建议，则尽可能给予满意的答复；属于有争议的，如发型、穿紧身裤等，则开展讨论，使学生增强参与意识。
    四十九中地处郊外，骑车的学生较多，不少人一度在校内骑车，乱停乱放，造成秩序混乱。后来，组织学生参与管理，让他们在管理别人的过程中增强接受管理的自觉性。现在，校内自行车停放有序，堪称一景。
    学生在学校不仅仅是承受和吸收，还必须渲泄。因此，各校都开始注意让学生“精力分洪”：南湖一中让学生自己办了份周报，说自己想说的话，谈自己想干的事；二十四中让学生设计中学生发型……学生在这些活动中释放了能量，不规范行为率大大下降。
    人有表现欲，中小学生的表现欲更是不可抑制。南京不少中小学一年一度的艺术节和科技周，为有专长的学生提供了一试身手的舞台。三中为确有一定水平的学生举办个人画展和作文展，支持学生在特长上冒尖。
    　　　　寄语“第一任教师”
    家长是孩子的第一任教师。几乎每一个家长，都谆谆教育孩子要“学好”，这是没有问题的。但是，如何才能达到这个目标，不少家长并不得法。五十中一个初二女生收到男生的第一封信后，在惶恐和好奇中回了信。她那当干部的父母知道后，一个劲逼问，又是查翻抽屉，下令不准来往。当收到第二封、第三封邀她外出游玩的信时，这位女生既不能自我控制，又害怕父母知道，只好偷偷出去约会。孩子们的情感是纯洁的，在上了青春期教育课后，她主动向老师敞开心扉，道出苦恼。后来，以老师说的理由为依据，妥善地处理了这一问题。
    时代的发展，对如何做合格的家长也提出了新的要求。据了解，学校对家长们的要求大致有以下几点：正确地爱孩子，不要溺爱或打骂；创造温暖与和谐、民主的家庭气氛；在言行上为子女作表率；鼓励孩子做力所能及的家务；与学校教育密切配合。
    据悉，江苏省妇联正准备同有关部门联合举办家长广播学校。无疑，将有更多的家长不仅成为孩子严厉的父母，还成为他们的良师和益友。
