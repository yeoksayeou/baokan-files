Dear Tianfeng,

You sent me the article "Reflections on Reading 'Returning to Tradition, Embracing Modernity'" and kindly asked for my opinions on the current state of domestic poetry. Recently, I have been busy writing a long piece on the youth student thought movement before and during the War of Resistance, and I only have time to read a bit of poetry. I would like to summarize my impressions with two lines from Tang poetry. The first is: "The flowers are in full bloom, almost blinding the eyes." The second is: "The grass is green in the distance, but up close, it seems to disappear."

The first line indicates that currently, there are many different styles and schools of poetry. The second line suggests that while it may seem like there is a unified green color at first glance, upon closer examination, there is still a lack of works that can truly move the heart. The second line describes the early spring scene, so of course, there will be a future like "The willow grass is green as silk."

I hope for a good future. I think that contemporary poetry also has three "losses."

It lacks emotion. All literary works must have genuine feelings, and the requirements for poetry are even higher. Poetry is the poet's direct expression of their innermost thoughts, unlike novels or dramas that have plots and third-person narratives. The poet's emotions, whether joy, anger, sorrow, or happiness, must reach a "burning" level. Only when objective things resonate deeply in the poet's heart and are expressed in poetry will they be moving. However, I have seen some poems that, although they reflect the scenes and even contradictions of reform, still lack the poet's strong emotions. As reform deepens, contradictions abound, and difficulties and dangers are strongly reflected in people's hearts. Naive optimism is not enough. Sharing the people's worries and hardships, and pointing out adverse forces, is the quality of a poet. The sincerity and depth of emotion are found here. Unfortunately, even poems that face reality are not commonly seen.

It lacks form. When I say it lacks form, I mean there is a new tendency towards formalism. I think that in a certain stage of literary development, theorists pointing out some biases is completely appropriate. For example, when literature is merely a policy interpretation and "serving politics" to the point of losing its literary essence, it is completely necessary to emphasize literature and the existence of literary workers as subjects. Poets should have individuality and creativity. But currently, there is another tendency where it seems that poets can lift themselves up by their own hair, detached from reality, detached from excellent and healthy traditions, and frequently issue declarations, self-proclaiming themselves as a school, and strive to "innovate" in this way. I ask, how can one innovate without a creative source? This can only lead to seeking new gimmicks in form and external appearance, inevitably falling into new formalism. The desire to innovate is a dissatisfaction with past stale poetry, which is understandable. But I hope to see innovation at a higher level.

It lacks substance. This refers to the content and weight of the poetry being too light. I am not against these kinds of poems, some of which I even appreciate. But from a macro perspective, there are too many of them, which is unsatisfying. It is not about the length of the poem. For example, Dai Wangshu's "Prison Wall Inscription" and Ai Qing's "Fish Fossil" are both short poems, both expressing personal feelings. The former is connected to a nation's suffering and also has the poet's free-thinking; the latter is connected to the disasters suffered by thousands of people in the "movement," and also carries the author's own fate, thus moving the heart. I am dissatisfied with "lightness" probably because of this reason.

Of course, this is not a comprehensive discussion on poetry. I have only briefly shared my shallow thoughts and send my regards.

Sincerely,
Zhou Difan

    小谈当前诗
    天风：
    你寄来《读〈回归传统，拥抱现代〉有感》一文，并蒙询及对当前国内诗歌现状的意见。近来我忙于写一关于抗战前后青年学生思想运动的长篇，只是挤时间读一点诗，想用两句唐诗概括我的观感。一曰乱花渐欲迷人眼；二曰草色遥看近却无。
    前一句说明当前百花齐放，流派纷陈。第二句则以为乍看似甚一片绿色，细研究则还缺乏震撼人心的力作。后一句是写初春景象，当然还会有“燕草碧如丝”的前景。我期望着。
    好景终需记住。我以为当前诗也有三“失”。
    失之于情。一切文艺作品都要有真情实感，而对诗的要求则更高。诗是诗人自己披肝沥胆直接发言，它不同于小说戏剧有情节、有第三人称等。诗人的感情，无论其喜怒哀乐，如果不到“燃烧”的程度，即客观事物在诗人心灵深处引起强烈共鸣，发而为诗，则不会感人。但现在，我看到有些诗虽是反映改革的即景乃至矛盾，还缺乏诗人强烈的感情。随着改革深化，矛盾重重，艰难险阻在人们心中有着强烈反映。天真的乐观主义不行。与人民共忧患，指向逆风恶势力，正是诗人的品质。感情的真挚和分量也正在这里。可惜，现在连面对现实社会的诗都还不多见。
    失之于形。我说失之于形，是说有一种新的形式主义倾向。我以为理论家们在文艺发展的一定阶段，指出某种偏向，是完全应该的。如当一段时期文艺只是政策图解，“为政治服务”到了失去文艺本质时，因而对文艺、对文艺工作者主体的存在强调提出，是完全必要的。诗人应有个性，应有创造性。但目前有另一种倾向，似乎诗人是可以自己提着自己的头发升天，脱离现实基地，脱离优秀健康传统，而动辄发宣言，自封自己为一个流派，力图这样“创新”。试问离开创作源泉，怎么可能创新呢？这就只可能在形式上、字句外形上追求新花样，不可免地坠入新的形式主义。力图创新是对过去陈腐的诗的不满，是可以理解的。但我希望能见到更高层次的创新。
    失之于轻。指诗所表达的内涵分量上嫌轻。以风情小曲、个人生活小品为多。我并不是反对这些，有些我甚至赞许。但从宏观上看太多，则有不满足之处。不在于诗的长短，如戴望舒的《狱中题壁》，艾青的《鱼化石》都是短诗，都是写个人感受。前者和一个民族的受难联系在一起，而也有诗人的飘逸之思；后者和那些千万人受灾难的“运动”联在一起，又寄寓了作者自己的命运，因而动人心魄。我所以嫌“轻”，大概是这方面的原因吧。
    当然这不是全面论诗，略陈浅见，并问好。
