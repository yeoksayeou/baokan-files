Li Guixian, a member of the State Council and Governor of the People's Bank of China, emphasized today that it is necessary to rectify the insurance market order, and no department should arbitrarily establish insurance institutions.

	Li Guixian pointed out at the closing of the National Insurance Work Conference today that in recent years, China's insurance industry has developed rapidly, the scope of insurance services has continued to expand, and the role of insurance in economic compensation and fund-raising has become increasingly prominent. However, due to the fact that some local departments have been keen on establishing insurance institutions in recent years, coupled with the People's Bank's lax approval and weak management, some problems have also emerged in the insurance work. Some units and departments use administrative power to force enterprises, institutions, and residents to participate in insurance; some insurance institutions use insurance premiums for production turnover or basic construction, and when policyholders suffer economic losses, they cannot compensate them in time; some use methods such as lowering insurance premiums to乱拉保险业务; and some even appropriate the insurance premiums listed as tax deductions for their own use or distribute them as bonuses to employees. Li Guixian said that the existence of the above problems seriously affects the credibility of national insurance, disrupts the insurance market order, and must be rectified. For companies or units that engage in illegal insurance business, they must be investigated and dealt with; for those that engage in insurance business in violation of insurance management regulations, the People's Bank must immediately stop them.

	Li Guixian requires all levels of insurance companies to actively take measures to strengthen publicity work and provide different content services for enterprises. At the same time, he also hopes that relevant national departments will actively mobilize and support their affiliated enterprises to participate in insurance.

　　李贵鲜强调要整顿保险市场秩序
    不得随意兴办保险机构
    本报讯  新华社记者丁坚铭、本报记者王锦鹄报道：国务委员兼中国人民银行行长李贵鲜今天强调，必须整顿保险市场秩序，任何部门都不得随意兴办保险机构。
    李贵鲜在今天闭幕的全国保险工作会议上指出，这几年我国保险事业发展非常迅速，保险服务领域不断扩大，保险的经济补偿和筹集资金的作用也越来越明显。但由于近年来一些地方部门热衷于兴办保险机构，加上人民银行审批不严，管理工作不力，也使保险工作出现了某些问题。一些单位和部门利用行政权力，强迫企事业单位和居民参加保险；有的保险机构把保险费用于生产周转或基本建设，当保户遭受到经济损失时不能及时补偿；有的采取压低保险费率等手段乱拉保险业务；更有甚者把税前列支的保险费自提自留，挪作他用或作为奖金发给职工。李贵鲜说，上述这些问题的存在严重影响了国家保险的信誉，扰乱了保险市场秩序，对此必须清理、整顿，对于违法经营保险业务的公司或单位，要进行清查处理；对违反保险管理条例规定经营保险业务，人民银行必须立即制止。
    李贵鲜要求各级保险公司要积极采取措施，加强宣传工作，多为企业提供不同内容的服务。同时他也希望国家有关部门积极动员和支持所属企业参加保险。
