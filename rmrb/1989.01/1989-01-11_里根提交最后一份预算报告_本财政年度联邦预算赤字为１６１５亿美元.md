Reagan submitted his final budget report to Congress today, detailing the 1990 fiscal year budget. This is the last budget report Reagan will submit.

The budget report plans for the U.S. federal government to spend $1,152 billion in the 1990 fiscal year, with revenues of $1,059 billion, resulting in a budget deficit of $925 billion. This aligns with the budget balance law's requirement to keep the deficit within $1,000 billion for that year. The report estimates that the federal budget deficit for the current fiscal year, starting October 1, 1988, will be $1,615 billion.

In the report, Reagan proposed setting the military budget for the 1990 fiscal year at $315.2 billion, a 2% increase over the actual budget for the current fiscal year. Reagan also proposed allocating $160 billion and $90 billion over the next two years to rescue hundreds of savings and loan associations in trouble. Additionally, $9 billion is proposed to be allocated for the cleanup and modernization of nuclear weapon factories. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that this project will cost $1,280 billion over the next 20 years.

At the same time, Reagan proposed canceling 82 domestic civilian expenditure projects. Over the past few years, Reagan has been pushing for Congress to accept these proposals, but without success.

　　里根提交最后一份预算报告
    本财政年度联邦预算赤字为１６１５亿美元
    新华社华盛顿１月９日电  美国总统里根今天向国会提交了１９９０财政年度预算报告，这也是里根提交的最后一份预算报告。
    里根的预算报告计划，１９９０财政年度美国联邦政府支出１１５２０亿美元，收入１０５９０亿美元，预算赤字为９２５亿美元，符合预算平衡法关于把该年度的预算赤字控制在１０００亿美元以内的要求。报告预计，１９８８年１０月１日开始的本财政年度联邦预算赤字为１６１５亿美元。
    里根在报告中建议，把１９９０财政年度的军费预算定为３１５２亿美元，比本财政年度实际增长２％。里根还建议，今明两年分别拨款１６０亿和９０亿美元，用于挽救数百家陷入困境的储蓄贷款协会。另外，拨款９亿美元，对核武器工厂进行清理和现代化。美国能源部估计，今后２０年内此项工程将耗资１２８０亿美元之多。
    与此同时，里根建议取消８２个国内民用开支项目。在过去几年中，里根一直在努力促使国会接受这些建议，但未能成功。
