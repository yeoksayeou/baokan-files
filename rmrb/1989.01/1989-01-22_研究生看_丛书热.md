Graduate students are generally concerned about the continuous publication of series books. They believe that the emergence of the "series boom" reflects the prosperity of China's publishing industry, but at present, there is a tendency towards disorder and excess. They hope that publishers of series books will pay attention to quality, establish credibility, and promote the healthy development of series book publishing.

More than 280 master's and doctoral students at the Graduate School of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences are enthusiastic readers of series books. Some of them have been actively involved in the publishing industry in recent years, serving as editorial board members of various series, and even leading the editing and writing. Over 90% of them say that series books are currently too chaotic and excessive, with only about 30% being of high quality and worthy of reference. The term "chaotic" refers to the lack of reasonable arrangement and design in many series books, with content that is too diverse, aiming to cover all aspects. The term "excessive" refers to the large number of publications, with various publishers rushing to follow the trend, resulting in many series books with similar concepts and forms, and overlapping content. For example, the "Art of Love Series" has been translated and published by six different publishers. These scholars believe that series books require higher standards from editors and publishers, and not all publishers can meet these requirements. According to preliminary information, there are already over 860 series books published in recent years, with scales ranging from a few dozen to over a hundred volumes. How can readers have the time to read so many? The chaos and excess also lead to quality issues. A philosophy graduate student said that in several series books he has seen, some translated articles have large sections of errors, making him doubt whether the translators understood the original text.

How to promote the healthy development of series book publishing? They believe that publishers overly pursue commercial interests, lacking a pursuit of cultural accumulation and the historical longevity of books. There is an urgent need for corresponding reforms and adjustments in publishing policies to establish a new order and mechanism for publishing work. At the same time, there should be an overall plan for the development of series books, implementing macro-control and guidance.

### 研究生看“丛书热”

　　研究生看“丛书热”
    对于正在源源不断推出丛书的汹涌潮流，青年研究生们普遍感到担忧。他们认为，“丛书热”的出现，是我国出版事业发展繁荣的表现，但目前大有“乱”和“滥”的趋势，希望丛书出版者注意质量，树立信誉，促使丛书出版健康发展。
    中国社科院研究生院的２８０多名在校硕士生、博士生多是丛书的热心读者，其中有些人近年来积极涉足出版界，成为不同丛书的编委，甚至领衔编著。９０％以上的人说，现在丛书出的太乱太滥，质量不高，可供借鉴的仅占３０％左右。所谓乱是许多丛书的编排设计缺乏合理章法，内容庞杂，大有一套丛书包打天下的劲头；所谓滥是出的太多，各家出版社纷纷赶浪头，致使许多丛书从构思到形式千篇一律，内容重复交叉，如《爱的艺术丛书》，就有６家翻译出版。这些学人认为，丛书这种品种对编辑、出版者要求比较高，不是所有的出版社都能适应。仅据初步了解，近几年丛书已达８６０多种，规模越来越大，少则几十本，多者上百本，读者哪有这么多功夫阅读？乱和滥还带来了质量不高的问题。一位哲学专业的硕士生说，我看到的几套丛书，其中有的翻译文章大段大段的错误，我都怀疑编译者自己是否读懂了原文。
    如何使丛书出版健康发展？他们认为出版者过多地追求商业性，缺乏对文化积累和对书籍历史生命力的追求，迫切需要配套改革和调整出版政策，建立出版工作新秩序新机制，同时对丛书的发展，应有个大体规划，实行宏观控制和指导。
