The Canadian Senate today approved the bill to implement the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement, thereby completing the legal approval process for the agreement and allowing it to come into effect as scheduled on January 1, 1989. However, it appears that the debate within Canada over this issue is far from over.

The proposal for free trade between Canada and the U.S. was first raised during a high-level meeting between Canadian Prime Minister Mulroney and U.S. President Reagan in March 1985. It was not until February 1, 1988, that the agreement was formally signed by President Reagan and Prime Minister Mulroney, initiating the parliamentary approval process in both countries. From the proposal to the completion, the entire process took nearly four years.

The bill to implement the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement was passed by the House of Commons in August this year. However, Liberal Party leader Turner instructed the Senate, where the Liberals held a majority, not to approve the bill unless Prime Minister Mulroney called for an election, allowing the Canadian people to decide. Under this situation, Prime Minister Mulroney had to announce an early election on October 1. During the 51-day election campaign, supporters and opponents of free trade engaged in a major battle, with Mulroney's Progressive Conservative Party ultimately emerging victorious.

The new parliamentary session, which began on December 12, was specifically convened to discuss and pass the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement. After heated debates, the bill was narrowly passed in the House of Commons in the early hours of December 24, the day before Christmas.

The Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement will come into effect on January 1, 1989. According to the agreement, tariffs on trade between Canada and the U.S. will be completely eliminated over a period of 10 years. Some tariffs will be removed immediately. It is certain that the debate surrounding this issue will continue, but the implementation of this agreement itself indicates that Canada and the U.S. have taken a historic step in improving their economic and trade relations.

### 加拿大参院批准加美自由贸易协定  协定于今日开始实施

　　加拿大参院批准加美自由贸易协定
    协定于今日开始实施
    本报渥太华１９８８年１２月３０日电  记者郭文福报道：加拿大联邦议会参议院今天批准了关于实施加美自由贸易协定的议案，从而正式完成了这项协定的法律批准手续，使之能按照原计划从１９８９年１月１日开始实施。但情况表明，加拿大内部各方围绕着这个问题的争论还远没有结束。
    加美之间实行自由贸易的主张是１９８５年３月加拿大总理马尔罗尼同美国总统里根在进行高级会晤时首次提出的，直到１９８８年２月１日里根总统和马尔罗尼总理才分别正式签署了这项协定，从而开始了两国议会审批的过程。到今天为止，这个问题从提出到完成一共经历了近４年的时间。
    关于实施加美自由贸易的议案今年８月份本来已在众议院获得通过，但自由党领袖特纳指示以自由党占多数的参议院不要批准这项议案，除非马尔罗尼总理宣布大选，让加拿大人民作出裁决。在这种形势下，马尔罗尼总理只好于１０月１日宣布提前大选。在为期５１天的大选中，支持和反对自由贸易的势力可以说是进行了一场大决斗，最后以马尔罗尼为首的进步保守党再次获胜。
    本月１２日开始的新的议会全体会议是专门讨论和通过加美自由贸易协定问题的。经过激烈辩论，议案才勉强在圣诞节前一天的２４日凌晨在众议院通过。
    加美自由贸易协定将从１９８９年１月１日开始实施，根据协定在１０年内加美的贸易关税将全部取消。其中有些商品的关税会立即取消。可以肯定围绕着这个问题的争论还会继续下去，但实施这一协定的本身，表明加美两国在改善经贸关系方面迈出了历史性的一步。
