The Zhangjiakou Bridge East Department Store has been strictly implementing the State Council's directives on controlling social purchasing power, prioritizing national interests in its operations. In 1988, the store refused 25 instances of collective purchases of state-controlled goods that violated regulations, forgoing over 10,000 yuan in potential revenue. This has earned the store recognition from relevant departments.

At the beginning of 1988, the store organized staff to conduct a thorough inspection and verification of the 7,000-plus items it sells, identifying 20 items that fall under the controlled category. They posted the names of these controlled goods in the sales hall, ensuring that sales staff were well-informed. They made it clear that any violations would result in accountability for the responsible parties. Once, a cement factory attempted to purchase 200 meters of woolen fabric worth 6,300 yuan, asking the salesperson to issue an invoice listing it as cloth. A district-level unit tried to buy 50 quartz clocks priced at over 70 yuan each, totaling 4,000 yuan, requesting the salesperson to issue an invoice for other items. The salesperson, recognizing these as state-controlled goods, firmly refused both transactions.

　　张家口一商场拒售专控商品
    本报讯  张家口桥东百货商场认真贯彻国务院关于控制社会集团购买力的精神，在经营中以国家利益为重，１９８８年拒绝一些集团违反规定购买国家专控商品的买卖２５次，少收入１万多元，受到有关部门的表彰。
    １９８８年初，这个商场组织人员对经营的７０００多种商品逐项进行了清查、核对，查出属于专控范围的有２０种商品。他们将这些专控商品品名张贴到营业大厅，让售货员记牢。如有违反，追究当事者责任。一次，一家水泥厂要购进２００米呢绒，价值６３００多元，买者让售货员开发票写成布料。一个区属单位要买７０元以上的石英钟５０个，价值４０００元，让售货员开成其他商品的发票，售货员考虑到这些是国家专控商品，就都坚决回绝了。
