Let the World Be Filled with Love
– Impressions of Inkersall Grasslands School
Guo Huimin

Inkersall Grasslands School in Matlock is an ordinary school for disabled children in Derbyshire, England, but it left an indelible impression on me.

The school lives up to its name. The main building is a modern single-story teaching and accommodation complex, but apart from the driveway and a small area of open space, the entire area is covered with lush green lawns and flower beds. The green grass and flowers contrast beautifully with the building's white walls, red roof, and brown doors and windows, making it feel like a garden. I noticed that in Derbyshire, almost all school buildings are among the best in the area.

The school has 105 disabled children, ranging in age from 2 to 15. Apart from a few who are blind or deaf, most are mentally handicapped. The school has 8 teachers, 9 service staff, 4 doctors, and 6 female cooks. There is also a nurse on duty 24 hours a day. Additionally, the school has 6 cars and jeeps dedicated to transporting the children.

In a spacious and bright classroom, several children aged 12 to 15 are sitting around a table having a lesson. The classes here are not just divided by age but also by the children's intellectual abilities.

The classroom is arranged differently from a typical school. Instead of a blackboard at the front and rows of seats, the children sit around a large table with the teacher, making the lesson feel like a conversation between parents and children.

This room is not just a classroom but also a place for the children's cultural and recreational activities. One wall has a blackboard with columns for compositions and drawings. Another wall is painted red and adorned with masks of fairy tale characters made by the children. Some are beautiful and lovely, some are funny, and some are frightening, all vivid and lifelike.

In another classroom, several children aged 4 to 7 are doing a craft activity. The desks are painted light yellow, which, according to the principles of color psychology, is said to stimulate the children's creativity and imagination. The curtains and chairs in the room are green, like they are living on the grass.

One side of the classroom has two pools filled with colorful plastic balls. The principal told us that these are for the children to play in. The children's bodies rubbing against the balls is beneficial for their health, and it also exercises their balance and stimulates their vision, making it both safe and attractive. A boy in a blue sweater took off his shoes, climbed onto the edge of the pool, and without hesitation, jumped into the pool of colorful balls. The balls immediately covered him, and he rolled around comfortably, occasionally waving at us with a smile.

In the computer classroom, the children are engaged in various activities: some are writing programs, some are entering data, some are playing a war game, and some are writing compositions. One child typed out the words "Welcome Chinese guests" in English. Looking at these lively and lovable youngsters, it's hard to believe they are mentally handicapped.

Seeing these hardworking, lively, and lovable disabled children, one can't help but feel a deep respect for the school's staff. The ultimate goal of every teacher and caregiver at the school is to stimulate and develop the children's intelligence and give them confidence in life. They are not just teachers to the disabled children but also like parents to them. The teachers dedicate their youth year after year to these disabled children. Without a lofty ideal, strong will, and perseverance, it would be impossible to do this.

As we waved goodbye and got into the car, golden sunlight bathed the school's lawns. The children, who had just finished their classes, were playing happily. Under the sunlight and the green grass, the children dressed in colorful clothes seemed like flowers blooming among the greenery. Looking at everything before me, I suddenly remembered that this is the hometown of Florence Nightingale, the founder of modern nursing! So, I thought of a song that everyone is singing now – "Let the World Be Filled with Love!"

　　让世界充满爱
    ——英克索尔草地学校印象
    郭慧民
    玛特洛克城的英克索尔草地学校，是英国德比郡一所普通的伤残儿童学校，但却给我留下难忘的印象。
    草地学校名副其实。学校的主建筑是一幢现代风格的单层教学住宿综合建筑，可它周围除留出汽车道和少许空地外，全是碧绿的草坪和花坛。绿草丽花映衬着主建筑乳白色的墙，铁红色的屋顶，茶色的门窗，仿佛进入了花园一般。我发现，在德比郡，几乎所有的学校建筑，在当地都属于最好的。
    这所学校共有１０５个伤残儿童，年龄从２岁到１５岁。他们除少数失明耳聋外，大部分是弱智儿童。学校有８位教师，９位服务员，４位医师和６位女厨师。另有２４小时值班的护士。此外，学校还有６辆轿车和吉普车，专门负责接送。
    在一间宽敞明亮的教室里，几个年龄在１２岁到１５岁之间的大孩子正围坐在桌子前上课。这里的分班不仅是根据年龄，还要考虑到孩子们的智力。
    教室的布置和普通学校不同，不是讲台上一块黑板，下面一排排座位，而是孩子们都围坐在一张大方桌周围听课，老师就和学生们坐在一起，讲课就像是父母或哥姐在和他们谈心。
    这间屋子不仅是孩子们的教室，还是这些孩子们文娱活动的场所。一面墙上挂着黑板，有作文栏、图画栏。另一面墙漆成红色，挂着孩子们亲手制作的各种童话人物面具，有的美丽可爱，有的滑稽可笑，有的狰狞可怕，生动逼真，栩栩如生。
    在另一间教室里，几个年龄在４岁到７岁之间的孩子正做手工剪贴。课桌漆成淡黄色，据说从色彩学的原理来讲，这种颜色有利于启迪孩子们的创造性和想象力。而屋子里的窗帘、椅子等都是绿色的，就像他们生活在绿草地上一样。
    教室的一边是两个盛满彩色塑料小圆球的池子。校长告诉我们，这是让孩子们跳进去玩的。孩子们身处滚动的彩球中，身体和球的摩擦有益于他们健康成长，同时也可以锻炼孩子们的平衡力，对视觉也是一种刺激，既安全又有吸引力。一个穿海蓝色羊毛衫的男孩子脱了鞋，翻上池边，毫不犹豫地跳进了彩球池中，五颜六色的塑胶彩球立刻把他埋起来。他在池中舒适自如地翻滚，不时笑着向我们挥动双手。
    在电子计算机教室，孩子们有的在编制程序，有的在输入数据，有的在进行两军交战，有的在写作文。一个孩子用英文打出了“欢迎中国客人”的字幕。望着这些活泼可爱的少年，真不敢相信他们是弱智儿童。
    看着这些学习用功，活泼可爱的伤残儿童，不由人不对学校工作人员产生崇高的敬意。学校每一位教师和护理人员的全部工作目的，都是为了启迪和开发孩子们的智力，让他们对生活充满信心。他们既是伤残儿童的老师，又是他们生活中的父母。老师们就这样年复一年地为残疾儿童奉献着自己美好的青春，没有一种崇高的信念，没有坚强的意志和毅力，是无法做到这一点的。
    当我们上车挥手告别时，金色的阳光洒满了学校的草地。下课的孩子们在快乐地嬉戏玩耍。在阳光的照耀下，在如茵碧草的映衬下，身着五颜六色衣服的孩子们，仿佛是朵朵鲜花点缀其间。望着眼前的一切，我忽然想起，这里不就是世界护理学的创始人南丁格尔的故乡吗？！于是，我想起了一首现在大家都在唱的歌——《让世界充满爱》！
