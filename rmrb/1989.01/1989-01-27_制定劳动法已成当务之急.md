The urgent need to enact labor law

	Xing Xinmin  Yang Ze

	China has yet to enact a comprehensive labor law. This situation indicates that labor legislation has been lagging behind. Not only does it lag behind other legal departments, but it also lags behind the requirements of labor system reforms and the overall economic system reform. Therefore, it is necessary to raise this issue to attract societal attention and reflection.

	The necessity and urgency of enacting labor law

	The necessity and urgency of enacting labor law are determined by its important position in the overall legal system. A complete legal system requires, under the guidance of the fundamental law of the state—the Constitution, the establishment of basic departmental laws such as civil law, criminal law, and labor law, as well as other subsidiary laws and regulations. The objects regulated by China's labor law are labor relations and other social relations closely related to labor relations. Labor relations involve the broadest social and economic relations. They are closely linked to all aspects of social and economic work, permeating the entire process of production, distribution, exchange, and consumption, and infiltrating every link of various economic departments. Laborers, as the main subjects of labor relations and the most active element of productive forces, have their rights and interests directly affecting their enthusiasm and creativity. This enthusiasm and creativity, in turn, tightly constrain social progress and economic development. Therefore, the absence of labor law signifies that China's socialist legal system is very incomplete; the rights and interests of workers cannot be genuinely guaranteed, and their enthusiasm and creativity cannot be fully unleashed.

	The enactment of labor law is an objective requirement for establishing a new order of socialist commodity economy. Labor work is an important component of economic work. In establishing the new economic order through various economic activities, the primary task is to establish a new type of labor relations. The establishment and consolidation of such labor relations require labor law as a guarantee. For example, to achieve the optimal allocation of labor and production resources and improve labor productivity, it is necessary to regulate the mutual selection between laborers and employers and the rational flow of labor; in the context of the coexistence of various ownership forms and production and operation methods, it is necessary to establish rules and systems regarding the relationships between different enterprises and between enterprises, to standardize the property rights of enterprises and their legal economic activities, the autonomy of enterprises in hiring, and other labor relations; it is necessary to establish rules and systems regarding the formation and operation of the market, to protect and develop fair competition and the legitimate rights of laborers in competition; it is necessary to establish rules and systems regarding technical training to improve the quality of laborers, etc. Only by establishing and improving a set of laws and regulations necessary for adjusting labor relations in the development of commodity economy can the smooth transition from the old to the new system be facilitated, and the dominant position of the new system be firmly established.

	The urgent need to deepen labor system reform

	China's labor system reform has made significant progress. After implementing the labor contract system for newly recruited workers, the optimization of labor combinations is being deeply carried out. Enterprises have the right to dismiss employees who violate discipline, and there are new regulations for handling labor disputes in state-owned enterprises; in terms of wage system reform, enterprises have implemented the method of linking economic benefits with total wages, and enterprises have more and more autonomy in wage distribution, gradually transitioning towards the goal of "autonomous distribution, state taxation." However, due to the lag in labor legislation, these reforms have not achieved the expected results. At the same time, some chaotic phenomena have emerged: enterprises find it difficult to dismiss employees who violate discipline; some contract workers in enterprises do not enjoy the benefits they should have, and some places use child labor; some still practice "disguised internal recruitment" and "children replacing parents"; some enterprises do not pay attention to labor protection and safety production, causing major accidents; some old-age insurance is not implemented; some enterprises issue excessive material rewards, bonuses, and subsidies, etc. For these chaotic phenomena, in recent years, only temporary measures have been taken, and the problems have not been fundamentally solved, resulting in orders being ignored and prohibitions being ineffective. This inevitably weakens the macro-control and management of labor work, affecting the deepening of labor system reform. To solve these problems, it is necessary to strengthen certain administrative measures, but more importantly, to strengthen labor legislation and give full play to the role of the legal system.

	The conditions and timing for enacting China's labor law are ripe

	First, the Constitution stipulates the basic principles of labor relations, providing the highest legal basis for enacting labor law. Although we are undergoing reforms, the basic principles of labor relations under socialist conditions stipulated by the Constitution will not change. They remain the fundamental guiding ideology and basis for enacting labor law.

	Second, the reform of the labor system has laid the practical foundation for enacting labor law. In recent years, China has carried out various reforms of the labor system and successively enacted a large number of single-item labor regulations. These single-item regulations and reform achievements have created the necessary conditions for enacting labor law.

	Third, we have made multiple attempts to enact labor law and accumulated some experience. As early as the mid-1950s, China had drafted a labor law. In early 1979, based on the instructions of Comrade Deng Xiaoping at the Central Work Conference to enact labor law and other laws, the then State Labor Bureau, together with relevant departments, conducted nearly five years of investigation and research and scientific analysis, and in July 1983, wrote the "Draft Labor Law." This draft summarized the experience of labor work since the founding of the nation, absorbed the beneficial components of foreign labor law, and had a fairly good overall design and framework. Based on this draft, incorporating the successful experiences of the ten years of reform, it is completely possible to enact a better labor law. Now, many countries in the world, including some developing countries, have enacted labor laws, and their successful experiences can also be learned from.

	We look forward to the early promulgation of the labor law!

### 制定劳动法已成当务之急

　　制定劳动法已成当务之急
    邢新民　杨喆
    我国至今还没有一部劳动法。这一状况表明，劳动立法工作一直处于落后状态。不但落后于其它部门法，更落后于劳动制度改革乃至整个经济体制改革的要求。为此，有必要提出这个问题，以引起社会的关注和思考。
    　　　　制定劳动法的必要性和紧迫性
    制定劳动法是由其在整个法律体系中的重要地位所决定的。健全的法律体系，要求在国家根本大法——宪法的统领下，应当有民法、刑法、劳动法等基本的部门法律以及其它附属性的法律、法规。我国的劳动法所调整的对象是劳动关系以及与劳动关系有着密切联系的其它社会关系。劳动关系涉及的是最广泛的社会关系和经济关系。它和社会经济工作的各个方面都有着十分密切的联系，贯穿于生产、分配、交换、消费等经济工作的全过程，渗透在经济工作各部门的各个环节上。劳动者作为劳动关系的主体，作为最活跃的生产力要素，其权利和利益能否得到保证，直接影响到其积极性和创造性的发挥，而这种积极性和创造性又紧紧制约着社会的进步和经济的发展。因此，没有劳动法，就标志着我国社会主义法律体系很不健全；职工的权利和利益难以得到切实可靠的保证，积极性和创造性难以充分发挥。
    制定劳动法是建立社会主义商品经济新秩序的客观要求。劳动工作是经济工作的重要组成部分。在建立经济新秩序的各种经济活动中，首要的是建立新型的劳动关系。这种劳动关系的确立和巩固要有劳动法作保证。如：要实现劳动力与生产资料的最佳配置，提高劳动生产率，就需要对劳动者与用人单位之间的双向选择、劳动力的合理流动作出规定；在多种所有制形式和多种生产经营方式并存的情况下，就需要建立有关不同企业本身和企业之间关系的行为规则与制度，规范企业的财产权利关系和企业的合法经济活动、企业用人自主的权利和其它劳动关系；需要建立有关市场形成和运行的规则与制度，保护和发展公平竞争和劳动者在竞争中的合法权益；需要建立有关技术培训的规则与制度，提高劳动者素质，等等。只有把发展商品经济所必须的调整劳动关系的一整套法律、法规建立和健全起来，才有利于顺利实现新旧体制的转换，牢固确立起新体制的主导地位。
    制定劳动法是全面深化劳动制度改革的迫切需要。我国的劳动制度改革取得了重要进展。继对新招工人普遍实行劳动合同制后，以优化劳动组合为突破口的搞活固定工制度正在深入进行。企业对违纪职工有权予以辞退，国营企业劳动争议处理有了新的规定；工资制度改革方面，企业实行了经济效益与工资总额挂钩浮动的办法，企业在工资分配上拥有越来越多的自主权，并逐步向“自主分配，国家征税”的目标过渡。但是，由于劳动立法工作没有跟上，使这些改革没能取得应有的效果。同时，还出现了一些混乱现象：企业辞退违纪职工难；有的企业合同制工人没有享受到应有的待遇，有的地方使用童工；有的仍然搞“变相内招”和“子女顶替”；有的企业对劳动保护、安全生产不重视，造成重大事故；有的养老保险不落实；有的企业滥发实物、奖金、补贴，等等。对这些混乱现象，近几年只是采取了头痛医头、脚痛医脚的办法，问题得不到根本解决，以至造成有令不行，有禁不止。这就不可避免地削弱了对劳动工作的宏观控制和管理，影响了劳动制度改革的深入。要解决这些问题，必须强化某些行政手段，但更重要的是加强劳动立法，充分发挥法制的作用。
    　　　　制定我国劳动法的条件和时机已成熟
    首先，宪法规定了劳动关系的各项基本原则，为制定劳动法提供了最高法律依据。尽管我们正在进行改革，但宪法规定的社会主义条件下劳动关系的基本原则是不会改变的，它仍然是制定劳动法的根本指导思想和依据。
    第二，劳动制度改革为制定劳动法奠定了实践基础。近几年来，我国对劳动制度进行了多项改革，并先后制定了一大批单项劳动法规。这些单项法规和改革成果为制定劳动法创造了必要条件。
    第三，我们对制定劳动法作过多次尝试，积累了一定经验。早在５０年代中期，我国就曾起草过劳动法。１９７９年初，根据邓小平同志在中央工作会议上的讲话中提出的要制定劳动法等法律的指示精神，当时的国家劳动总局会同有关部门，经过近５年的调查研究和科学分析，于１９８３年７月写出了《劳动法（草案）》。这个草案总结了建国以来劳动工作的经验，吸收了国外劳动法的有益成分，基本轮廓和总体设计都是比较好的。在这个草案的基础上，补入十年改革的成功经验，制定出一部较好的劳动法是完全可能的。现在，世界许多国家包括一些发展中国家都制定了劳动法，他们的成功经验也可以借鉴。
　　我们期待着劳动法早日出台！
