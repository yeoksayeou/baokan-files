According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 9th. (Reporter Zhou Shuchun) Premier Li Peng reiterated today that China's improvement of relations with India "will in no way affect" the existing friendly cooperative relations between China and other South Asian countries.

Li Peng made the above remarks during his meeting with Bangladeshi Deputy Prime Minister Kazi Zafar Ahmed in Zhongnanhai this morning. He said that the resumption of direct exchanges between Chinese and Indian leaders, which had been suspended for over 30 years, is in line with the trend of easing tensions in the world.

Li Peng said that some countries in the world that were previously hostile or had disputes have now begun to engage in dialogue and seek political solutions to historical legacies. He hoped that the countries in South Asia could live in harmony with each other in the spirit of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

During the meeting, Li Peng inquired about the situation in Bangladesh after the floods and typhoons last year and the reconstruction efforts. Deputy Prime Minister Kazi, on behalf of his government and people, expressed gratitude to China for its support in Bangladesh's disaster relief work.

Li Peng said that China also experienced some natural disasters last year, so he understood the difficulties Bangladesh faced, but the assistance China provided was very limited, and it was more of a spiritual comfort.

During the meeting, Deputy Prime Minister Kazi, on behalf of President Ershad, once again invited Li Peng to visit Bangladesh. Premier Li Peng accepted the invitation with pleasure, saying that visiting Bangladesh as soon as possible was also his personal wish and the intention of the Chinese government.

Deputy Prime Minister Kazi and his entourage left Beijing this afternoon to return home.
