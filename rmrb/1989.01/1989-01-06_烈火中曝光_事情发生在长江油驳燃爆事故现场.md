At around 1 a.m. on January 2, a massive fire broke out near Xintan Kou in Honghu City, Hubei Province, in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River! At that time, the 62008 tugboat belonging to the Nanjing Oil Transportation Company of the Yangtze River Shipping Company was towing a fleet of three oil barges—63040, 63023, and 63103—loaded with 7,200 tons of crude oil. Suddenly, two of the oil barges caught fire, the fleet disintegrated, and the burning barges drifted downstream for several kilometers before running aground... At 3:40 a.m., the Wuhan Fire Brigade received an order to immediately extinguish the fire. The 37-year-old deputy brigade commander, Li Jinwen, immediately set out, and at the same time, ordered by phone: the Hanyang and Duoluokou fire brigades should immediately dispatch two Yellow River foam fire trucks to the designated location by 4:20 a.m. to rush to the scene of the fire.

At 6:12 a.m., the fire trucks arrived at the riverbank. Li Jinwen and the deputy director of the training department immediately got out of the car to observe the fire and the terrain. Through the thick river fog, they saw two oil barges burning about a kilometer apart. The upstream barge, 63023, was engulfed in flames, with flames rising tens of meters high, and thick black smoke like a giant dragon piercing the sky. This ship was beyond rescue; the downstream barge, 63040, had fire on only one-quarter of the bow, and the flames were not high. They decided to extinguish the fierce fire and save this oil barge.

The flames devoured the crude oil, scorching the hearts of the firefighters. The soldiers were eager to rush in and fight the flames! However, the ship was burning in the middle of the river, and the fire trucks were useless on the riverbank, roaring back and forth in despair. Watching the precious national crude oil turn to ashes was agonizing! Extremely agonizing! According to the regulations of the People's Republic of China Fire Protection Law: water-based firefighting is the responsibility of the transportation department. As an urban fire brigade, the Wuhan Fire Brigade had almost no water-based firefighting equipment. The Yangtze River Shipping Company, with thousands of ships and billions of fixed assets, had only one tugboat and fire-fighting ship, which was undergoing maintenance at the shipyard at that moment.

Without firefighting equipment, watching the big fire burn, perhaps no one would blame the comrades of the Wuhan Fire Brigade; but this was not the character of the firefighters. Li Jinwen dispatched people to find small boats while reporting the battle plan to the city command center: board the small boats to extinguish the fire on the oil barge.

Around 8:50 a.m., a small cement motor-sailboat was found by the river. The boat owner was an individual transport operator, Li Zhengxiu. Upon learning that the firefighters needed the boat to extinguish the fire and rescue national property, Li Zhengxiu immediately had his assistant start the engine without a word. The small boat, carrying 22 firefighters and two fire pumps, quickly approached the 63040 oil barge through the rolling thick smoke.

The small boat approached. Li Jinwen was the first to board the oil barge, followed by the deputy director of the propaganda department, Cheng Jingfa, and the deputy director of the training department, Li Guo'an. The two companies of firefighters carried two water cannons, dividing into two teams to flank the fire from both sides of the ship. Two water dragons roared towards the raging fire dragon, engaging in a life-and-death struggle. Li Jinwen and Li Guo'an stood at the front of the team, directing their comrades to extinguish the flames. The fire dragon began to retreat, and the water dragon advanced inch by inch...

Ten minutes passed. Just as the soldiers were pressing their advantage, the stern of the oil barge emitted a series of hissing sounds, followed by a burst of flames. Not good! This was the signal of an explosion. Li Jinwen immediately ordered, "Retreat!" Before the words were out, a deafening explosion shook the stern of the oil barge. The explosion point was under Cheng Jingfa's feet, who was concentrating on filming. Cheng Jingfa was thrown into the air tens of meters high; soldier Tian Xiaolin was also thrown into the air, with countless pieces of metal flying towards his head, chest, and legs... The sudden explosion threw Li Jinwen and his comrades into the icy river.

The firefighters struggled in the river, and the river water could take away our soldiers at any moment!

Water and fire are merciless, but people are kind. The boat owner, Li Zhengxiu, who was operating the motor-sailboat, disregarded the danger of leaking and burning crude oil and bravely steered the small boat towards the fallen soldiers. He and the two firefighters on the boat used bamboo poles, wooden bars, and fire hoses to rescue 8 firefighters from the river, including the martyred soldier Tian Xiaolin. At the same time, another boat carrying more than 20 leaders who were observing the fire was also nearby. When the oil barge exploded, this boat was about 40 to 50 meters away. The explosion sounded, and the people on the boat saw the flames and the air blast throwing the soldiers' bodies into the air, saw the soldiers in the water calling for help and waving... The provincial fire brigade commander, Wu Qinan, and deputy political commissar, Cai Guangqian, watched their comrades struggle in the water, their hearts torn apart. Wu Qinan shouted, "Quick, move forward, save them!" Cai Guangqian immediately ran to the stern to direct the sailors to move the rescue equipment to the bow, preparing to save people...

Wu Qinan's shout and the sailors' actions did not move the leaders on the boat at all. The boat was turning around. Wu Qinan was anxious and shouted to Cai Guangqian, "You go to the bridge and supervise them to move forward!"

According to Wu Qinan, someone on the boat said, "The boat is full of leaders, we must consider the overall situation."

Wu Qinan and Cai Guangqian were helpless.

Just saved onto the individual motor-sailboat, Li Jinwen saw the boat turning around, and two rows of angry tears welled up in his eyes! He said later that if that boat had not left, our soldiers would have had at least three or four fewer casualties.

A big fire burned two oil barges worth more than 2 million yuan and hundreds of millions of yuan worth of crude oil; the Wuhan Fire Brigade lost one soldier on the spot, seven soldiers missing, and eight soldiers injured.

The howling wind of the river mourns!

The surging river water roars in anger!

　　烈火中曝光
    ——事情发生在长江油驳燃爆事故现场
    龚达发　桂小玲
    １月２日凌晨１时许，长江中游的湖北省洪湖市新滩口附近，一起长江航运史最大的火灾爆发了！
    是时，长江轮船总公司所属的南京油运公司６２００８号拖轮，拖着满载７２００吨原油的油驳６３０４０号、６３０２３号、６３１０３号组成的船队行驶在江中。突然，其中两艘油驳起火，船队解体，着火的油驳顺江漂流数公里后搁浅……３时４０分，下游８０公里处的武汉市消防支队接到立即扑救的命令。３７岁的副支队长李金文立即披挂出征，同时电话命令：汉阳、舵落口两个消防中队立即出动两台黄河泡沫消防车，４时２０分到指定地点结集，同奔火场。
    ６时１２分，消防车赶到江边。李金文和战训科副科长立即下车观察火势和地形。透过浓浓的江雾，他们看到两艘油驳在相距一公里的地方燃烧。上游的６３０２３号已经满船是火，火头窜起十几米高，黑色的浓烟像一条巨龙直插云际，这条船已无法施救了；下游的６３０４０号只有船头１／４部有火，且火头不高。他们决心扑灭烈火，救出这艘油驳。
    火舌吞噬着原油，也灼烧着消防战士的心。战士们摩拳擦掌，恨不得立即扑上去与烈火搏斗！但是船在江中燃烧，消防车“英雄无用武之地”，在江堤上来回奔驰，发出撕心裂肺的长啸。眼看国家宝贵的原油化为灰烬，焦急啊！万分的焦急！按照中华人民共和国消防条例规定：水上消防由交通部门负责。作为城市消防队伍，武汉消防支队几乎没有任何水上消防设备。而拥有数千条船舶、几十亿固定资产的长江轮船公司，仅有的一条拖、消防两用船，此刻正在船厂维修。
    没有灭火设备，眼睁睁地看着大火燃烧，也许不会有人责怪武汉消防支队的同志；但这不是消防战士的性格。李金文一面派人寻找小型船只，一面向市总指挥部报告作战方案：乘小船上油驳灭火。
    ８时５０分左右，在江边找到一只水泥机帆船。船主是个体运输专业户李正修。李正修得知消防战士要船扑火抢救国家财产，二话没说立即让助手发动机器。小船载着２２名消防战士和两台消防水泵，冒着滚滚浓烟，迅速逼近６３０４０油驳。
    小船靠近了。李金文第一个冲上了油驳，紧接着，支队宣传科副科长程敬发、战训科副科长李国安也冲上来了。两个中队的消防队员抬着两台水枪，兵分两路沿船的两侧向火头包抄。两条水龙吼叫着扑向熊熊燃烧的火龙，水龙与火龙展开了殊死搏斗。李金文、李国安站在队伍的最前面，指挥战友们扑打。火龙开始退却，水龙步步进逼，一寸，两寸……
    十分钟过去了。正当战士们乘胜追击的时候，油驳后舱发出一阵嗞嗞怪响，随着一团火苗窜起。不好！这是爆炸的信号。李金文立即命令：“快撤！”话音未落，一声惊天动地的巨响，油驳后舱爆炸。爆点在程敬发脚下，正专心致志摄像的程敬发被巨大的气浪抛到十几米的高空；战士田晓林也被抛到空中，无数的钢铁碎片飞向他的头部、胸部、腿部……突如其来的大爆炸把李金文和他的战友们掀进了冰冷的江里。
    消防战士在江中挣扎，江水随时都会卷走我们的战士！
    水火无情人有情。正在机帆船上操作的船主李正修不顾原油外溢燃烧的危险，毅然驾起小船迎着落水者前行。他和船上两名消防战士一起拿出竹竿、木杠、消防水带，抛向江中救起８名消防战士，其中有已经牺牲的田晓林同志。也在此时，另一艘载着２０多位察看火情的领导干部的船，也正在现场附近。油驳爆炸的时候，这艘船就在四五十米的地方。爆炸声响，船上的人看到了火光、气浪挟着战士的躯体抛向空中，看到了水中的战士怀着生的希望向他们呼救、招手……这条船上的省消防总队队长吴启南、副政委蔡光前眼看战友在水中挣扎，心如刀绞。吴启南大声疾呼：“快，往前开，救人！”蔡光前立即跑到后舱指挥水手们把救生物品搬到船头，做好救人准备……
    吴启南的呼喊、水手们的行动，竟丝毫也没有打动在座的领导干部们。船在掉头。吴启南急了，高声对蔡光前嚷道：“你快到驾驶室，监督他们往前开！”
    据吴启南说，当时船上有人发话：“船上都是领导，要顾全大局。”
    吴启南、蔡光前无能为力了。
    刚刚被救上个体户机帆船的李金文看见船在掉头，两行悲愤的泪水夺眶而出！他事后说，如果那条船不走，我们的战士至少可以少牺牲三四个。
    一场大火烧掉两条价值２００多万元的油驳，烧掉了数百万元的原油；武汉消防支队一名战士当场牺牲，七名战士失踪，八名指战员受伤。
    呼啸的江风在悲泣！
    汹涌的江水在怒吼！
