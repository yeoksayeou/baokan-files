The State Council Office recently transmitted the National Tourism Administration's ten-point opinions on strengthening tourism work, requiring various local and relevant departments to actively cooperate with and support the tourism departments' work, and promoting the healthy and coordinated development of China's tourism industry.

The National Tourism Administration's opinions on strengthening tourism work state that China's tourism industry has already established a considerable foundation and basic conditions for further accelerated development. The sustained and stable development trend of the international tourism industry is also beneficial for us to advance the tourism industry.

To further strengthen the coordination and management of tourism work and strive for greater development of China's tourism industry, the National Tourism Administration proposes ten opinions:

1. Strengthen tourism management work and reform tourism management institutions at all levels. Provincial, autonomous region, and municipal people's governments, as well as key tourism cities, especially regions rich in tourism resources, should establish and improve tourism management institutions according to the principles of separating party and government, administration and enterprise, and streamlining and unifying. Tourism management departments at all levels should genuinely transform their functions and separate administration from enterprise.

2. Further clarify the National Tourism Administration's industry management scope and authority, and establish a system of graded management. All tourism enterprises and institutions nationwide, including tourism colleges and research institutions, and travel agencies operating international and domestic tourism, shall maintain their existing affiliations. However, the Tourism Administration shall, in accordance with relevant state regulations, implement industry management and supervision.

3. Deepen comprehensive reforms and implement a contract responsibility system.

4. Reform the travel agency management system. Encourage and support China Travel Service, China International Travel Service, and China Youth Travel Service, the three key travel agencies, to develop towards establishing enterprise groups and enterprise conglomerates. For existing travel agencies of various types, conduct assessments and rectifications in accordance with relevant state regulations.

5. Strengthen tourism promotion and marketing work, and strive to expand the international market. All foreign affairs units should cooperate with each other and consider the overall situation when promoting tourism routes abroad, and should not engage in price-cutting competition or mutual denigration. Encourage and promote voluntary cooperation among foreign affairs units to conduct joint marketing abroad. Tourism promotion and marketing funds can be gradually increased annually.

6. Strengthen macro-management of newly built tourism-related foreign hotels and promote hotel management system reforms. In the future, generally, no more high-end tourism-related foreign hotels should be constructed. In cold and less popular regions, medium and low-end hotels can be built according to market demand. In cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Guilin, Xi'an, and Hangzhou, for a considerable period, no new approvals should be given for Sino-foreign joint ventures or cooperative hotel constructions. Efforts should be made to accelerate the establishment of China's own hotel management companies. In 1989, all tourism-related foreign hotels nationwide should undergo star rating evaluations and gradually establish a system for issuing and revoking tourism-related foreign hotel business licenses.

7. Cautiously proceed with tourism price reforms and strengthen the management of tourism foreign exchange income and settlement.

8. Vigorously develop the production and sales of tourism commodities and souvenirs.

9. Strengthen the construction of the tourism workforce and focus on professional ethics and discipline education.

10. Strengthen coordination and cooperation with relevant departments.

　　国务院办公厅批转国家旅游局十点意见    
    加强协调管理　发展旅游事业
    据新华社北京１月２４日电  国务院办公厅新近转发了国家旅游局关于加强旅游工作的十点意见，要求各地、各有关部门积极配合和支持旅游部门的工作，推动我国旅游事业更加健康、协调地发展。
    国家旅游局关于加强旅游工作的意见说，目前我国旅游业的发展已具备了相当的基础和进一步加快发展的基本条件，国际旅游业持续稳定发展的大趋势也有利于我们把旅游事业搞上去。
    为进一步加强对旅游工作的协调管理，争取我国旅游业有一个更大的发展，国家旅游局提出十点意见：
    一、加强旅游管理工作，搞好各级旅游管理机构改革。各省、自治区、直辖市人民政府及旅游重点城市，特别是旅游资源比较丰富的热点地区，要按照党政分开、政企分开和精简、统一的原则，建立健全旅游管理机构。各级旅游管理部门要切实转变职能，政企分开。
    二、进一步明确国家旅游局的行业管理范围和管理权限，建立分级管理的办法和制度。全国所有的旅游企事业单位，包括旅游院校和科研单位，经营国际、国内旅游业务的旅行社等，其隶属关系均不变，但旅游局要按照国家的有关规定，实行行业管理和检查监督。
    三、全面深化改革，实行承包经营责任制。
    四、改革旅行社管理体制。鼓励、支持国旅、中旅、青旅三大骨干旅行社向建立企业联合体和企业集团的方向发展。对已开办的各类旅行社，要按照国家有关规定进行考核和整顿。
    五、加强旅游对外宣传招徕工作，努力开拓国际客源市场。各外联单位在对外推销旅游线路时，要互相配合，顾全大局，不得低于保护价竞销或相互贬低。鼓励提倡各外联单位自愿组织起来，开展对外联合推销。旅游宣传推销经费可逐年有所增加。
    六、加强对新建旅游涉外饭店的宏观管理，推进饭店管理制度改革。今后，各地一般不要再建设高档旅游涉外饭店。温冷点地区可根据旅游客源市场需求，酌建中低档饭店。北京、上海、广州、桂林、西安、杭州等城市，在相当时间里原则上不再新批中外合资或合作建造饭店。要加快建立我国自己的饭店管理公司。１９８９年，全国旅游涉外饭店要进行星级评定工作，并逐步建立旅游涉外饭店营业许可证发放和吊销制度。
    七、审慎进行旅游价格方面的改革，加强对旅游外汇收支及结汇的管理。
    八、大力发展旅游商品、旅游纪念品的生产和销售。
    九、加强旅游从业人员的队伍建设，抓好职业道德和职业纪律教育。
    十、加强与各有关部门的协调配合。
