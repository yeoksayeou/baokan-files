In the year just passed, China obtained a "world record" that was not at all cause for celebration: in 1988, the total production of baijiu reached 5 billion kilograms, more than double the amount from eight years ago, far surpassing the Soviet Union, known for its wine production, and ranking first in the world. Each year, 12.5 billion kilograms of grain are consumed, equivalent to one month's worth of food for 1 billion people.

Year after year, the increasing production of baijiu is consuming people's health. Last year, among those who died from cardiovascular diseases nationwide, 81% were long-term heavy drinkers; among children with low intelligence, more than 50% had parents with a drinking habit.

Baijiu brings so many worries!

Why is there so much baijiu on the market? Some people believe it is the negative effect of "combining prohibition with taxation." Currently, China adopts a high tax policy for baijiu production, with a 50% tax rate on baijiu products. This method of "combining prohibition with taxation" was originally intended to limit the development of baijiu. However, due to the widespread implementation of the fiscal responsibility system in various places in China in recent years, local governments, in order to collect more taxes, not only did not suppress baijiu production but instead fanned the flames. "To be a good county magistrate, first build a distillery." From the perspective of the national industrial and commercial and tax authorities issuing certificates and tax collection, there are currently more than 40,000 large and small distilleries nationwide, of which 70% are small township distilleries that have developed in recent years. These small distilleries mostly use outdated workshop techniques, consuming 4 kilograms of grain to produce 1 kilogram of baijiu, which is more than 50% higher than that of state-owned specialized large factories, and the product quality is low. The repeated construction of factories everywhere not only occupies a large amount of funds, wastes manpower and equipment, but also squeezes out the large ones, increases grain consumption, and has low efficiency.

The alcohol market is chaotic, and inventory is increasing, causing commercial complaints. This is another consequence of the blind development of baijiu. Currently, the production of baijiu has far exceeded the market's absorption capacity, and there is a large accumulation of various brands of baijiu. In many places, a "baijiu war" has broken out. Some distilleries use various forms of rebates to expand sales; some use false labels to deceive customers; some participate in numerous evaluations, sparing no expense to buy a good reputation. According to the Ministry of Light Industry, there were more than 10 evaluations of various forms of baijiu in 1988.

Alcohol is a "catalyst" for high consumption. In 1987, Jining City, Shandong Province conducted a survey of 120 peasant households, and found that the average per capita living expenses for that year were 340.4 yuan, of which 38% was spent on alcohol and food. Qingdao Cotton Textile Factory surveyed 100 households of workers, and found that in 1987, the average household spent 465 yuan on banquets, which was 1/4 of their wage income. Some families, because of frequent drinking, have marital discord, leading to family breakups; some people, because of excessive drinking, harm their offspring, and their children are often mentally retarded or disabled.

What is particularly worthy of attention is that in recent years, the practice of using public funds for feasting has become rampant, and the alcohol on the table has been upgraded, with more and more dishes being ordered. According to experts, the consumption ratio of dishes accompanying alcohol, in general households, is 1:3, while in public banquets, it is generally 1:10. If calculated at an average ratio of 1:6.5, the annual national consumption of alcohol is 13 billion yuan (in 1986, the China Consumer Association estimated that the annual sales of various types of alcohol produced by the industry amounted to nearly 600 million tons, approximately 13 billion yuan), plus 84.5 billion yuan for dishes, totaling 97.5 billion yuan, equivalent to nearly twice the annual national income of Shanghai, and equal to the annual income of some countries. Although this figure is not very accurate, it cannot but make people think deeply.

Of course, the current problem is not to cancel all alcohol production and sales, but to cool down the "baijiu fever" and change China's image as a "nation of drinkers." Many experts believe that adjusting the baijiu policy may reduce tax revenue, but in the long run, it will definitely be beneficial to the country and the people for this grain-deficient country.

　　白酒带来几多忧
    本报记者  万贵生
    在刚刚过去的一年，我国得到了一个并不值得高兴的“世界之最”：１９８８年白酒总产量达到５０亿公斤，比８年前增长一倍多，远远超过产酒著称的苏联，居世界第一。每年耗粮达１２５亿公斤，相当于１０亿人口一个月的口粮。
    连年增加的白酒吞噬着人们的健康。去年全国因心血管疾病死亡者中，长期大量饮酒的占８１％；全国低智能儿中，父母有嗜酒习惯的占５０％以上。
    白酒带来几多忧！
    为什么市场上的白酒如此之多？有人认为这是“寓禁于征”的负效应。目前，我国对白酒生产采取高税政策，产品税中白酒税率为５０％。这种“寓禁于征”的办法，原本为了限制白酒的发展。但是，由于近几年来我国各地普遍实行了财政包干制，地方政府为了多征税，不仅对白酒生产没有抑制，反而推波助澜。“当好县长，先办酒厂”。仅从国家工商、税务部门发证和税收情况看，眼下全国有大大小小的酒厂４万多家，其中７０％是近几年发展的乡镇小酒厂。这些小酒厂大多沿用落后的作坊工艺，生产１公斤白酒要耗４公斤粮食，比国营专业大厂高出５０％以上，而且产品质量低。到处重复建厂，不仅占用了大量资金，浪费了人力和设备，还以小挤大，耗粮剧增，效益低下。
    酒市混乱，库存增加，商业叫苦。这是白酒盲目发展的又一恶果。目前，白酒产量已大大超过了市场的吞吐能力，杂牌白酒大量积压，许多地方掀起了“白酒大战”。一些酒厂采用各种形式的回扣扩大销售；有些偷梁换柱，用假冒商标蒙骗顾客；有的参加名目繁多的评比，不惜“血本”，花钱买好名声。据轻工业部介绍，１９８８年各种形式的白酒评比就有１０多次。
    酒是高消费的“催化剂”。山东济宁市１９８７年对此作过调查，１２０户接受调查的农民当年生活支出人均３４０．４元，其中酒菜费就占３８％。青岛国棉二厂对１００户职工调查，１９８７年户均酒宴费４６５元，占工资收入的１／４。有的家庭因为经常喝酒，夫妻不和，酿成妻离子散的悲剧；有的人因为嗜酒无度，遗害后代，其子女多为痴呆残人。
    尤其值得重视的是，近几年来，用公款吃喝之风盛行，上席的酒逐步升级，点的菜越来越多。据行家分析，伴酒之菜的消费量价值比，家庭一般是１∶３，公款请客一般为１∶１０。如果按平均比值１∶６．５计算，每年全国酒的消费为１３０亿元（１９８６年，中国消费者协会曾作过估计，该年度仅工业酿制各种酒销量近６００万吨，约１３０亿元），加上菜肴８４５亿元，共计９７５亿元，相当于上海市国民年收入的近两倍，等于一些国家的年总收入。这个数字虽然不很精确，但不能不引起人们的深思。
    当然，现在的问题不是取消一切酒的生产和销售，而是要对“白酒热”降温，改变我国“饮酒大国”的形象。许多专家认为，调整白酒政策可能会减少税收，但从长计议，对我们这个缺粮国家，肯定是利国利民之举。
