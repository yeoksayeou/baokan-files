Scientists from the Liaoning Provincial Soil and Water Conservation Research Institute successfully used the Dongfanghong mobile powder sprayer to spray seed grass in Chaoyang City. This technology has now passed provincial-level appraisal. Experts believe that this achievement opens up a new path for arid grassland areas.

From 1980, when small-scale trials began, to 1988, when large-scale seeding was conducted, the spray seeding grass technology rapidly expanded the area of grassland in Chaoyang City. The total area of spray-seeded grass in the city has accumulated to over 150,000 mu, with a success rate of about 98%. Last year, the provincial soil and water conservation research institute, along with Chaoyang City and six county-level grassland stations under its jurisdiction, successfully implemented large-scale spray seeding.

　　喷播种草法大面积试验成功
    新华社沈阳１月８日电  （记者陈宝玉）辽宁省水土保持研究所的科技人员在朝阳市试用东方红机动喷粉器喷播种草获得成功。目前，这项技术已经通过省级鉴定。有关专家认为，这项成果为干旱种草牧区开辟了一条新的途径。
    从１９８０年开始小区试验到１９８８年大面积播种的喷播种草技术，使朝阳市种草面积迅速扩大。全市喷播种草面积累计已达１５万多亩，成草率达９８％左右。去年，省水土保持研究所与朝阳市和市辖的６个县的草原站，大面积实行喷播种均获成功。
