Adjust Varieties, Improve Quality, Reduce Consumption: Metallurgical Ministry Sets New Tasks for Steel Industry in 1989

		BEIJING, Jan. 12 (Xinhua) -- The current challenges facing China's steel industry are significant. How should we address them? Minister of Metallurgical Industry Qi Yuanjing, at the national metallurgical work conference held on January 12, emphasized the need to adjust steel product varieties, improve product quality, reduce energy consumption, and increase economic benefits. He outlined the new tasks for the steel industry in 1989.

		In 1988, China's steel industry achieved remarkable results, with steel production reaching 59.2 million tons, an increase of 3 million tons from the previous year. However, this output still falls short of meeting the needs of the national economy, making it a weak link in the overall economic development. Over the next two years, the steel industry will face new challenges: with steel production unlikely to see significant growth, the demand for steel product varieties and quality will be higher and more stringent. Due to the country's foreign exchange constraints, some important steel products that were previously imported will now need to be produced domestically. With the increase in factors reducing profits, the demand for improving economic benefits will be higher and more stringent. It is estimated that the entire industry will face a reduction in profits of 4 to 5 billion yuan this year.

		To overcome these difficulties, Qi Yuanjing called on metallurgical workers to recognize the situation, focus on internal improvements, deepen enterprise reforms, and tap into internal potential.

		- Adjust the product structure to increase the production of urgently needed steel products for various sectors of the national economy, thereby increasing effective supply. The focus will be on increasing the production of cold-rolled sheets, hot-rolled sheets, galvanized sheets, tin-plated sheets, silicon steel sheets, seamless pipes, and other steel products. This year, the production of these products should increase by 10 million tons compared to last year. Through efforts over the next two years, the self-sufficiency rate of 50 types of special steels used in railways, automobiles, ships, petroleum, power plants, and coal industries should be significantly improved.

		- With the focus on improving the yield and reducing consumption, efforts should be made to significantly increase economic benefits.

		- Limited funds should be concentrated on key projects and key engineering tasks that ensure product varieties, quality, and benefits. The construction and renovation projects should be prioritized, ensuring the completion of the second phase of Baogang (Baoshan Iron & Steel Complex) project, which is crucial for increasing the production of thin plates and other scarce varieties.

		- Comprehensive rectification and management should be strengthened, and macro-control should be enhanced. Projects that mainly rely on insufficient raw material supplies, have surplus domestic processing capacity, poor economic benefits, or severe pollution should be firmly stopped. Existing small blast furnaces and small rolling mills should be rectified.

　　调整品种　提高质量　降低消耗
    冶金部布置钢铁工业今年新任务
    本报北京１月１２日讯  记者刘燮阳报道：当前我国钢铁工业面临新困难，怎么办？冶金部部长戚元靖在１２日召开的全国冶金工作会议上围绕调整钢材品种，提高产品质量，降低能源消耗，增加经济效益，布置今年钢铁工业新任务。
    １９８８年，我国钢铁工业取得了很大的成绩，钢的产量达到５９２０万吨，比上年增加３００万吨。但是，仍然不能适应国民经济发展的需要，是国民经济的薄弱环节。今明两年，钢铁工业面临新的考验：在钢产量不可能有较大幅度增长的情况下，对钢铁产品品种、质量的要求将更高更严。由于国家外汇紧缺，过去靠进口的一些重要钢材品种，将转向靠国内生产。减利因素增加，对提高经济效益的要求将更高更严了，预计全行业全年减利因素将达４０—５０亿元。
    为了克服这些困难，戚元靖号召冶金战线职工要认清形势，眼睛朝内，深化企业改革，挖掘内部潜力。
    ——调整产品结构，大力增产国民经济各部门急需的短缺钢材，增加有效供给。主要是增产冷轧板、热轧板、镀锌板、镀锡板、硅钢片、无缝管等钢材，今年要比去年再增加１００万吨。经过今明两年的努力，铁道、汽车、船舶、石油、电站、煤炭工业所用的５０种专用钢材，要较大幅度提高自给率。
    ——以提高成材率、降低消耗为重点，大力提高经济效益。
    ——把有限的资金集中到保品种、保质量、保效益的重点项目、重点工程上来。对建设、改造项目进行排队，要确保宝钢二期工程这一作为增产薄板等短缺品种的重中之重。
    ——综合治理整顿，加强行业管理，强化宏观控制。坚决停止建设主要原材料供应不足、国内加工能力有富余、经济效益差或污染严重的项目。对现有的小高炉、小轧板等，要进行整顿。
