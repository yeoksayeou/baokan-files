	Increasing Production, Stabilizing Prices, and Timely Delivery: Hebei Improves Agricultural Material Supply

	Xinhua News Agency, Shijiazhuang: Correspondent Chen Guoqing reports: At the start of the new year, Hebei Province has formulated new measures to ensure the supply of fertilizers, pesticides, and plastic films and other agricultural production materials in 1989, creating conditions for a bumper harvest.

	In response to the problem of slow development in the production of agricultural materials and the large supply-demand gap in recent years, Hebei Province has prioritized increasing agricultural industrial production. It has decided to treat agricultural industrial electricity as a guaranteed project, determining the supply index at the beginning of the year to ensure planned supply. The original and auxiliary materials needed by various fertilizer plants planned within the province will be ensured by all means. At the same time, a portion of pesticides and plastic films will be imported.

	Hebei also decided to strengthen the planned management of fertilizer production and supply. The urea, ammonium nitrate, and compound fertilizers produced by five large and medium-sized fertilizer plants in the province will all be allocated according to the plan, with no retention by cities and prefectures. Enterprises that need to adjust fertilizers for necessary production materials will also be arranged by the province. The fertilizers produced by small fertilizer plants in various cities and prefectures will be allocated by the province through a directive plan for the surplus part that is adjusted within the city and prefecture.

	The ex-factory prices of fertilizers, pesticides, and plastic films, as well as the sales prices and maximum prices that farmers see, will be determined by the agricultural production materials coordination leading group. Fertilizers and diesel used for linkage will be supplied at a flat price, and the rest will be supplied at a comprehensive price.

	To prevent "official speculation" and "private speculation," Hebei designated the supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels to be responsible for organizing the adjustment of agricultural production materials, reducing circulation links as much as possible, and strictly implementing price policies to eliminate improper practices. To facilitate public supervision, the provincial government will publish the flat price, comprehensive price, and maximum price of fertilizers, pesticides, and plastic films in newspapers; specialized departments should publicize the local supply, prices, and award sales standards, encouraging the public to report and expose units and individuals that speculate on agricultural materials.

### 增加生产　稳定价格　及时兑现  河北改进农用物资供应

　　增加生产　稳定价格　及时兑现
    河北改进农用物资供应
    本报石家庄电  记者陈国琦报道：新年伊始，河北省已经制订出新措施，确保今年化肥、农药、农膜等农用生产资料供应，为夺取农业丰收创造条件。
    针对近几年农用生产资料生产发展不快、供需矛盾大的问题，河北省把增加农用工业生产放在重要位置，决定把农用工业用电作为必保项目，年初核定供应指标，保证计划供应。省内计划安排的各化肥厂所需原辅材料，千方百计予以保证。同时，进口一部分农药和农膜。
    河北还决定加强对化肥生产供应的计划管理。全省五个大中型化肥厂生产的尿素、硝铵和复混肥，全部纳入计划分配，地市不再留成。企业为解决生产物资必要的调剂化肥，也由省统一安排。各地市小化肥厂生产的化肥，本地市调剂余供部分，由省实行指令性计划调拨。
    化肥、农药、农膜的出厂价以及同农民见面的销售价和最高限价，由农用生产资料协调领导小组确定。用于挂钩的化肥、柴油一律实行平价供应，其余实行综合价。
    为防止“官倒”“私倒”，河北指定由各级供销社生产资料公司负责组织调剂农用生产资料，尽量减少流通环节，并严格价格政策，杜绝不正之风。为便于群众监督，省政府将在报纸上公布化肥、农药、农膜的平价、综合价及最高限价；专营部门要把当地货源、价格及奖售标准公之于众，鼓励群众检举揭发倒卖农用物资的单位和个人。
