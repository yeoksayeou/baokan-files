In the afternoon of January 24, the workers' congress of the Yantai Port Engineering Company in Shandong Province held a meeting to commend Manager Guo Qicheng and presented him with three special gifts: a sweater, a pair of leather shoes, and a mirror with a quartz clock embedded in it.

Since 1988, Manager Guo, relying on the support of cadres and the masses, has focused on improving economic efficiency, deepening reforms, and ensuring safety and quality for survival. He has forged a path of "unity and expansion." Over the past year, the company achieved a profit of 870,000 yuan, a 31% increase over 1987. The project qualification rate reached 100%, the excellent product rate was 40%, and the consumption rate of "three materials" (raw materials, fuel, and power) was reduced by 3%. The frequency of various accidents was zero. According to relevant regulations, Manager Guo should have received a bonus of 3,000 yuan, but he refused to accept it. To commend Manager Guo's outstanding contributions to the company and to express the affection of all employees, the workers' congress decided: to have the female employees of the company knit a sweater for Manager Guo to show the close bond between the manager and the employees; to give Manager Guo a pair of leather shoes, wishing him to continue to forge ahead on the path of reform; and to present him with a mirror with a quartz clock embedded in it, to inspire him to continually summarize the experiences and lessons from his work, leading all employees to strive every second to improve the company's economic efficiency.

　　三件特别的礼物
    杨青　王京南
    元月２４日下午，山东省烟台港务工程公司职代会召开会议，表彰经理郭启成，并向他赠送了三件特别礼物：一件毛衣、一双皮鞋和一架镶有石英钟的镜子。
    １９８８年以来，郭经理依靠干部、群众以提高经济效益为中心，以深化改革为动力，以安全质量求生存，走出一条“联合、扩散”的道路。一年来，公司实现利润８７万元，比１９８７年增长３１％，工程合格率达到１００％，优良品率达４０％，“三材”消耗率降低３％，各类事故频率为零。按照有关规定，郭经理应得奖金３０００元，但他却分文不要。为表彰郭经理对公司的突出贡献，表达全体职工对他的爱戴之情，公司职代会决定：由本公司女职工亲手给郭经理织一件毛衣，以示经理与职工心连心；送给经理一双皮鞋，愿他在今后的改革大道上开拓前进；赠一架镶有石英钟的镜子，以激励经理在新的一年里，不断地总结工作中的经验教训，带领全体职工争分夺秒地为提高公司的经济效益而奋斗。
    捧着这三件特别礼物，郭启成脸上露出的神情，说明他深知职工的一片心意。
