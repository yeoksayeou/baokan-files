Japanese opposition parties have issued statements criticizing the government's 1989 budget proposal, which sees the defense budget exceed 1% of the country's GDP for the second time.

The New China News Agency reported from Tokyo on January 24 that various Japanese opposition parties today released statements criticizing the government's budget plan for the fiscal year 1989. The plan includes a defense budget that exceeds 1% of the country's GDP.

The Japanese Socialist Party accused the government's budget plan of going against the times. The Komeito Party emphasized that it would not tolerate the defense budget exceeding 1% of GDP becoming a fixed policy. The Japanese Communist Party criticized the new budget plan as a "large-scale military expansion and tax increase budget that sacrifices the people."
