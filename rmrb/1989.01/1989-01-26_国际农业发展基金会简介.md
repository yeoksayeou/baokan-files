The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) is a specialized agency of the United Nations. It was established in December 1977, with its headquarters in Rome. It currently has 143 member countries. The highest authority is the Governing Council. The current President is Idriss Jazairy (Algerian).

The purpose of IFAD is to raise funds to assist developing countries in developing agriculture under favorable conditions. The use of funds is divided into loans and grants, with loans classified into special loans, medium-term loans, and ordinary loans based on the degree of favorability. The main sources of funds are donations from developed countries and member countries of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, with voluntary contributions from developing countries. Since its establishment, IFAD has provided assistance totaling over $10 billion for more than 240 projects in 91 developing countries, of which $2.6 billion is from IFAD's own funds.

China joined IFAD in January 1980 and has sent representatives to attend every Governing Council session since the 3rd session. China has applied for and received over $130 million in preferential loans from IFAD, which have been used for projects such as the construction of grasslands, the development of animal husbandry and fisheries, the reclamation of saline-alkali lands, and the development of agriculture.

　　国际农业发展基金会简介
    国际农业发展基金会（简称农发基金）是联合国的一个专门机构。它成立于１９７７年１２月，总部设在罗马，现有成员１４３个。最高权力机构为管理大会。伊德里斯·雅泽里（阿尔及利亚人）为现任总裁。
    农发基金的宗旨是筹集资金，以优惠条件帮助发展中国家发展农业。基金的使用分贷款和赠款两种，贷款按优惠程度分为特别贷款、中等贷款和普通贷款。资金来源主要是发达国家和石油输出国组织成员国的捐款，发展中国家自愿认捐。农发基金自成立至今已为９１个发展中国家的２４０多个项目提供了价值１００亿美元以上的资助，其中２６亿美元系农发基金本身的资金。
    中国于１９８０年１月加入农发基金，并派出代表出席了自第３届以来的历届管理大会。中国已从农发基金申请到１．３亿多美元的优惠贷款，用于建设草原，发展畜牧业和渔业，治理盐碱地，发展农业等项目。
