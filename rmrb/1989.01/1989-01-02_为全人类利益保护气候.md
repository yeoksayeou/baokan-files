Since the end of World War II, due to urbanization, industrialization, modernization of transportation, and a rapidly increasing population, the extensive use of mineral energy has led to a rapid increase in the concentrations of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, methane, and other gases in the atmosphere. This has inhibited the dissipation of heat from the Earth's surface into space, creating a "greenhouse effect" and causing global temperatures to rise.

Statistics show that currently, the world emits over 5 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere each year. The amounts of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and other toxic gases are also increasing rapidly, severely polluting the environment and becoming significant factors in climate change.

Another cause of climate change is the large-scale destruction of forests. Historically, the Earth's total forest area was 7.6 billion hectares, but by 1985, this had been reduced to 3.92 billion hectares. Currently, 20 hectares of forest are lost every minute.

Data from China's meteorological departments indicate that China's climate, like the global climate, has also shown abnormalities, with the most noticeable changes occurring since the 1980s.

In 1980, the plum rain season in the Yangtze River basin arrived one week earlier than usual, followed by continuous heavy rains in large areas of southern China. The Jianghuai and Huanghuai regions experienced the coolest summer in a century. At the same time, the north experienced a severe drought in July and August, and a "neck-drying" drought in autumn, both of which were unprecedented since the founding of the People's Republic. Agricultural and pastoral production suffered the greatest losses in 30 years. In October, the climate across the country changed dramatically. From Northeast China to Guangdong, temperatures were generally 2-4 degrees Celsius higher than usual.

Since then, the climate phenomenon of "cold spring, cool summer, warm autumn, and mild winter" has persisted in China. Statistics show that in 1986, 180 million mu (approximately 12 million hectares) of farmland in China suffered from drought. In Henan Province, 2 million people faced drinking water shortages.

Currently, China emits over 28 million tons of dust annually, and the consumption of forest resources exceeds the growth rate.

Protecting the environment and climate is an urgent issue in China as well.

　　为全人类利益保护气候
    自二次世界大战以来，由于城市化、工业化、交通现代化，以及人口剧增，矿物能源的大量消耗，使大气中的二氧化碳、二氧化硫、甲烷等含量迅速增加，抑制了地球表面热量向太空散逸，形成了“温室效应”，造成地球气温升高。
    据统计，目前全世界每年向大气中排放的二氧化碳有５０多亿吨，二氧化硫、氮氧化物等有毒气体也在急剧增加，从而严重地污染了环境，构成了促使气候变化的重要因素。
    导致气候变化的原因还有森林的大面积消亡。据统计，历史上，地球的森林总面积曾达７６亿公顷，到１９８５年只剩下３９．２亿公顷了。目前，地球上每分钟就有２０公顷森林消失。
    我国气象部门的资料表明，我国气候同全球一样也出现异常，以进入８０年代以来最为明显。
    １９８０年，长江流域的梅雨期较常年提前了１个星期，随之而来的便是南方广大地区持续不断的暴雨。江淮、黄淮地区出现了百年来未见的“凉爽的夏季”。与此同时，北方则出现了建国以来罕见的大范围严重伏旱与秋季“卡脖旱”。农牧业生产受到３０年来从未有的损失。进入１０月，全国各地的气候又全然反了过来。从东北至广东，气温普遍较常年偏高２—４摄氏度。
    从此以后，“春寒，夏凉，秋冬暖”的气候现象一直徘徊在我国土地上。据统计，１９８６年，全国农田受旱面积达１．８亿亩。河南甚至发生２００万人饮水困难。
    目前，我国年排尘量２８００多万吨，森林资源消耗量大于生长量。
    爱护环境，保护气候，在我国也是十分迫切的问题。
