	Town and township enterprises in China have gradually formed systems for talent training, quality inspection, and supervision over the past few years. Currently, more than 3,300 talent training bases and 29 provincial-level and above quality inspection and supervision institutions have begun to guide the "wild horse" of town and township enterprises onto the track of relying on technological progress.

	In recent years, with self-raised funds as the main source and state allocations as a supplement, the Ministry of Agriculture and various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have established or are in the process of establishing 33 town and township enterprise training centers. Provinces and municipalities such as Zhejiang, Shandong, Hunan, Anhui, Hebei, Jilin, Liaoning, and Beijing and Tianjin have initially formed a training network at the provincial (municipal), county, township, and enterprise levels. At the same time, the Ministry of Agriculture and some provinces and municipalities have established, jointly built, or commissioned training for senior and intermediate management personnel and technical personnel in town and township enterprises through various channels. In the past three years, the town and township enterprise system nationwide has trained more than 11 million workers. Through commissioning colleges and universities for training, radio and television education, and correspondence courses, nearly 100,000 professionals with college and above qualifications have been trained.

	The evaluation and appointment of technical titles and positions for technical personnel in town and township enterprises have also begun in various places. According to statistics from 19 provinces for township and village-level enterprises, by the end of 1987, town and township enterprises had evaluated and appointed 235,000 technical personnel of various types, an increase of 10 times compared to 1983.

	With the support of the standardization departments, the Ministry of Agriculture and various provinces have jointly invested in the establishment or construction of 29 provincial-level and above quality inspection and supervision institutions for key industries and products of town and township enterprises. Some provinces and cities have also raised funds to establish a number of provincial and municipal-level quality inspection and supervision institutions. The establishment of these institutions is beneficial for town and township enterprises to shift from focusing on increasing output value to emphasizing product quality.

	In recent years, various levels of town and township enterprise management departments have also promoted a number of applicable technologies with relatively high economic and technological value. Among them, 16 agricultural and sideline product processing projects have been included in the national key new technology development and promotion projects, with a social and economic benefit of 160 million yuan. The various levels of excellent product evaluations, quality management awards, technological progress awards, energy-saving awards, and outstanding farmer entrepreneurship activities carried out in various places have also played a positive role in promoting the technological progress of town and township enterprises.

	In addition, in recent years, various places have established a number of service institutions dedicated to serving town and township enterprises, such as information centers, technical consultation centers, and talent exchange centers.

　　乡镇企业走入依靠科技进步轨道
    人才培训质量检测监督形成体系
    新华社北京１月３日电  （实习生叶俊东）我国乡镇企业的人才培训、质量检测监督等近几年已逐步形成体系。目前，遍布全国３３００多个人才培训基地、２９个省级以上的质量检测监督机构开始使乡镇企业这匹“野马”逐渐走入依靠科技进步的轨道。
    近几年，以自筹资金为主、国家拨款为辅，农业部和各省、市、自治区已建和在建的乡镇企业培训中心共３３个，浙、鲁、湘、皖、冀、吉、辽和京、津等省、市已初步形成省（市）、县、乡、企业的培训网络。同时，农业部和一些省、市还通过各种渠道自建、联建、委托代培等方式，举办了一批乡镇企业的高中级管理人员和技术人员的高等、中等专业院校和专业班。近３年，全国乡镇企业系统共培训职工１１００万人次以上，通过委托大专院校代培、电教、函教等形式，培养出具有大中专水平的专业人才近１０万人。
    乡镇企业技术人员职称职务的评聘工作也开始在各地相继进行。据对１９个省的乡、村两级企业统计，到１９８７年底乡镇企业已评聘各类专业技术人员２３．５万人，比１９８３年提高１０倍。
    在标准部门的支持下，农业部和各省联合投资已建和在建的乡镇企业重点行业、重点产品的省级以上质量检测监督机构共２９个，还有一些省、地（市）自筹资金建立了一批省、地（市）级质量检测监督机构。这类机构的设置，有利于乡镇企业从重产值的增长转向注重产品质量。
    近几年，各级乡镇企业主管部门还抓了一批具有较高经济技术价值的适用技术推广，其中１６个农副产品加工项目已列入国家重点新技术开发和推广项目，社会经济效益达１．６亿元。各地相继开展的评比各级优质产品、质量管理奖、科技进步奖、节能奖、优秀农民企业家等活动，对推动乡镇企业的技术进步也起到了积极作用。
    此外，近几年各地还建立了一批专门为乡镇企业服务的信息中心、技术咨询中心、人才交流中心等服务机构。
