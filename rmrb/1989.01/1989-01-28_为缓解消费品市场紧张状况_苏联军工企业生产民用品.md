To alleviate the tension in the consumer goods market, some Soviet military industrial enterprises are currently producing color televisions, refrigerators, vacuum cleaners, and bicycles.

Vice Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, Biryukova, said at a press conference on January 23 that the current poor supply situation in the Soviet market is due to three main reasons: first, for many years, there has been an emphasis on the growth of production of means of production, while consumer goods production has been neglected; second, the growth of residents' monetary income has outpaced the growth of commodity production, resulting in a current market shortage of 70 billion rubles worth of goods; third, the import of consumer goods has decreased, and domestic production has not been able to compensate for this.

She said that the government is taking measures to organize the production of consumer goods. She revealed that the government recently decided to convert about 300 enterprises and workshops from the machinery manufacturing, fuel and energy, and military industries to the production of daily consumer goods. To encourage the heavy industry sector to produce more and better consumer goods, the government will provide financial and profit retention incentives. Biryukova predicted that due to these measures, the production of daily consumer goods this year will increase by 18 billion rubles compared to last year, and in 1990, it will increase by 48 billion rubles.

She also discussed the situation of hidden price increases in Soviet goods. She said that compared to 1985, the average price of light industrial products has increased by 3% to 5%, and the price increase for some products has even reached 17% to 18%.

    苏联军工企业生产民用品
    新华社莫斯科电（记者竺承军）苏联部长会议副主席比留科娃１月２３日在记者招待会上说，为了缓解消费品市场的紧张状况，苏联的一些军工厂目前正在生产彩电、电冰箱、吸尘器和自行车等产品。
    比留科娃认为，当前苏联市场供应情况不佳的原因有三条：一是多年来片面追求生产资料生产的增长，而对消费品生产重视不够；二是居民货币收入的增长超过了商品生产的增长，以致今天市场还亏空７００亿卢布的商品；三是消费品的进口数量减少，而国内又无相应的生产予以补偿。
    她说，政府正在努力采取措施，组织消费品生产。她透露，政府不久前已作出决议，将机器制造、燃料能源、军工等部门的约３００个企业和车间转产日用消费品。为了鼓励重工业部门更多更好地生产消费品，政府将从财政和利润留成方面予以优惠。比留科娃预计，由于采取措施，今年日用消费品的产量将比去年增长１８０亿卢布，而１９９０年将增加４８０亿卢布。
    她还谈到了苏联商品暗中涨价的情况。她说，与１９８５年相比，轻工产品平均提价３％—５％，某些产品的提价幅度甚至达到了１７％—１８％。
