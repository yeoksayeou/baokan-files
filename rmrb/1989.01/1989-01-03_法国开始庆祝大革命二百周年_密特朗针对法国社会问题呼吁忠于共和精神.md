	France begins celebration of the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution
	Mitterrand calls for adherence to the spirit of the Republic in the face of French social problems

	Xinhua News Agency, Paris, January 1 (Reporter Wu Baozhang) A giant hot air balloon took off this afternoon from the Parc de la Villette in central Paris, and the balloonist, as the balloon ascended, continuously scattered copies of the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen to the ground.

	Paris and the provinces launched 98 hot air balloons today, marking the beginning of the 200th anniversary celebrations of the French Revolution.

	At the same time, Paris and the provinces organized readings of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. The postal department issued a commemorative first-day cover and a commemorative stamp for the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution. The commemorative stamp features the official emblem of the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution: three birds soaring in the tricolor of red, white, and blue.

	President Mitterrand, when he met with the chairman of the French Revolution 200th Anniversary Committee, Jean Nay, in August last year, stated that France would celebrate the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution with the "spirit of the Republic." After being re-elected as the president of the Republic in May last year, Mitterrand's first task was to have a passage about the "spirit of the Republic" read in primary and secondary schools. The Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Culture selected this passage from Victor Hugo's work "Rights and Laws": "Freedom, equality, and fraternity are the three steps of the sublime ladder of humanity. Freedom is a right, equality is an action, and fraternity is a duty." In his New Year's address, President Mitterrand pointed out: "Two hundred years after the French Revolution, France still has 'many more people who are excluded and abandoned by society than is generally believed. The reasons are unemployment, illness, lack of knowledge, poverty, or skin color.' Therefore, he called on the French people to 'remain faithful to the spirit of the Republic.'"

	The activities commemorating the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution will be carried out throughout the year. The capital and the provinces have prepared 4,000 commemorative celebration projects, 400 works about the French Revolution have already been published, and 200 seminars will be held in various places. In March, large-scale tree-planting activities will be held across France. Blue spruce, white birch, and red beech will be given special attention. The celebrations will reach their peak during the French National Day, on July 14, when 7,000 people will sing the famous "La Marseillaise" from the Arc de Triomphe to the Place de la Concorde. During this period, the heads of state of the seven major Western industrialized countries will hold a summit in Paris. In August, France will invite young people from various countries to gather in Strasbourg to jointly formulate the "Declaration of the Youth of the 21st Century."

	The 1789 French Revolution marked the complete collapse of the monarchical system and the birth of the republican system in French history.

　　法国开始庆祝大革命二百周年
    密特朗针对法国社会问题呼吁忠于共和精神
    新华社巴黎１月１日电  （记者吴葆璋）一只巨大的热气球今天下午从巴黎市中心瓦窑宫公园腾空而起，乘坐热气球的飞行员，随着气球的升起，不断向地面抛撒１７８９年《人权宣言》的文本。
    法国首都和外省今天放飞了９８只热气球，标志着大革命２００周年庆祝活动的开始。
    与此同时，巴黎和外省还组织了朗读《人权宣言》活动，邮电部发行了大革命２００周年纪念首日封和一枚纪念邮票。这枚纪念邮票以官定大革命２００周年纪念标记为图案：３只在红蓝白黎明三色中翱翔的飞鸟。
    密特朗总统在去年８月接见纪念大革命２００周年委员会主席让内奈时表示，法国今年将以“共和精神”庆祝大革命２００周年。去年５月份再度当选为共和国总统之后，密特朗布置的第一个任务就是在中小学朗读一段关于“共和精神”的文字。教育部长和文化部长从作家雨果的著作《权利和法律》中摘录的这段文字是：“自由、平等、兄弟情谊是人类崇高阶梯的三个台阶。自由是权利，平等是行为，兄弟情谊是义务。”密特朗总统在今年的元旦祝词中指出：大革命２００年后的今天，法国仍有“比通常认为要多得多的被社会排斥、抛弃的人。其原因是失业、疾病、没有知识、贫困或者是由于肤色”。因此，他呼吁法国人“应该忠于共和精神”。
    纪念大革命２００周年的活动将在全年陆续展开。首都和外省共准备了４０００个纪念庆祝项目，４００部关于大革命的著作已开始问世，２００个座谈会将在各地分别举行。今年３月，法国各地将举行大规模植树活动。蓝杉、白桦、红山毛榉将受到格外重视。庆祝活动在法国国庆节期间达到高峰，７月１４日，从马约门到协和广场，７０００人将合唱著名的《马赛曲》。在此期间，西方７个工业国的首脑会议将在巴黎举行。８月份，法国将邀请各国青年聚会斯特拉斯堡共同制定《２１世纪世界青年宣言》。
    法国１７８９年革命在法国历史上标志着君主专制制度的彻底崩溃和共和制度的诞生。
