During the harvest season, approximately 10,000 people gathered in Madison, Wisconsin, to participate in a "Harvest Festival." The harvest here is not of ordinary crops, but of cannabis leaves.

In the United States, cannabis production is a highly profitable business, with annual revenues reaching tens of billions of dollars. According to a spokesperson for the American Cannabis Legal Reform Organization, there are 50 million cannabis users in the United States. In recent years, cannabis production has become an integral part of American agriculture. Statistics show that one-quarter of the cannabis on the U.S. market is grown in households. The government has no clear policy on household cultivation, and only confiscates cannabis grown in household pots. As a result, this type of cultivation is on the rise. In 1986, 1,077 greenhouses growing cannabis were discovered, and in 1987, this number increased to 1,192. Growers also exploit loopholes in the policy, moving cannabis from household pots to the forest, as the government policy does not explicitly prohibit growing cannabis in the wild. Consequently, state-owned forests have become private cannabis "plantations." The Forestry Bureau has had to take up arms against these growers. Cannabis production is increasing mainly because the government's crackdown is ineffective. Non-lawful cannabis growers are only fined or detained, and these growers are not deterred, instead becoming more brazen in developing this industry.

Whether the bountiful cannabis harvest is a blessing or a curse is still a matter of debate in the United States.

　　大麻叶丰收话喜忧
    贾光伟
    秋收时节，大约有１万多人涌到美国威斯康星州麦迪逊市，参加一个“丰收节”，这里丰收的不是一般作物，而是大麻叶。
    在美国，大麻叶生产是一项赚大钱的买卖，每年产值达几十亿美元。据美国大麻叶法律改革组织发言人说，在美国有５０００万人吸大麻叶。近几年，大麻叶生产已发展成为美国农业一个组成部分。据统计，美国市场上的大麻叶１／４是家庭种植的。而政府对家庭种植业没有明确政策，只将家庭盆种大麻叶没收了之。结果，这类种植业有增无减。１９８６年查获的种大麻叶的温室有１０７７个，１９８７年增加到１１９２个。种植者还钻政策的空子，纷纷将大麻叶从家庭的花盆转到森林里，因为政府政策未明确规定，在野外禁止种植大麻叶。结果，国营林场成了私人种大麻叶的“种植园”。林业局不得不拿起武器来对付这些种植者。大麻叶越种越多，主要是政府打击不力，对非法种植大麻叶者只是给予罚款或拘留的处分，而这些种植者根本不在乎，反而更加肆无忌惮地发展这项种植业。
    大麻叶丰收是祸还是福在美国至今还在争议之中。
