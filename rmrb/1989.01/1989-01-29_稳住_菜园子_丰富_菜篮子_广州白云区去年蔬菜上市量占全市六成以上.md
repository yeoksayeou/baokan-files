The beginning of the new year saw Guangzhou residents expressing general satisfaction with their "vegetable basket." This is closely related to the efforts of the suburban White Cloud District's farmers in developing their vegetable gardens.

White Cloud District produced a total of 446,000 tons of vegetables last year, an increase of 17.2% over 1987. The market supply reached 376,000 tons, accounting for more than 60% of Guangzhou's total vegetable market supply. Throughout the year, there were no fewer than 40 varieties of vegetables. The price of vegetables sold by farmers in the district was 1.3% lower than in 1987.

To enrich the city residents' "vegetable basket," it is essential to stabilize the rural "vegetable garden." The district committee and government have made efforts in this regard. Last year, Guangzhou City assigned White Cloud District a vegetable planting area of 66,000 mu (approximately 4,400 hectares). In reality, the district's annual vegetable planting area exceeded 86,000 mu (approximately 5,733 hectares), an increase of 20,000 mu (approximately 1,333 hectares).

One effective measure to stabilize the vegetable garden is the implementation of "industry supporting agriculture." Last year, the district, town, and village levels collectively allocated 14 million yuan from industrial enterprise revenues to support farmers in vegetable cultivation. Some villages even imported fertilizers and distributed them to farmers free of charge. To promote poultry and livestock production, the district provided financial, seedling, and technical support to farmers with good management practices and high management levels. Sixty-four farmers received district support and produced 1.5 million heads of pigs and 15 million poultry, enriching the market supply.

　　稳住“菜园子”丰富“菜篮子”    
    广州白云区去年蔬菜上市量占全市六成以上
    本报讯  记者梁兆明报道：新年伊始，广州市居民对“菜篮子”表示基本满意。这同市郊白云区广大农民抓紧菜园子建设不无关系。
    白云区去年蔬菜总产量达４４．６万吨，比１９８７年增长１７．２％，上市量３７．６万吨，占广州市蔬菜总上市量的６成以上，全年蔬菜品种不下４０个。全区菜农销售的菜价，比１９８７年下降１．３％。
    要丰富市民“菜篮子”，必须稳住农村的“菜园子”。区委、区政府为此作出了努力。去年广州市给白云区下达的蔬菜种植面积是６．６万多亩，实际上全区常年蔬菜种植面积超过８．６万亩，扩大面积２万亩。
    稳住菜园子的一个有力措施是实行“以工补菜”。去年，白云区镇、村、队三级从工业企业收入中，共拨出１４００万元扶助菜农种菜，有的村还进口化肥，无偿发给农民。为了发展禽畜生产，区里又从资金、种苗、技术等方面重点扶持经营思想好、管理水平高的农民。６４户农民得到区里的扶助后，去年生产生猪１５万头，家禽１５００万只，丰富了市场供应。
