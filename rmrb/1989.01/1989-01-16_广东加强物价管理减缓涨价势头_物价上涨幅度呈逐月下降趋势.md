Guangdong Strengthens Price Management to Slow Down Price Increases
Price Increases Show a Monthly Decreasing Trend

	Reported by Liang Zhaoming for the People's Daily: In recent months, Guangdong Province has strengthened market price management, effectively slowing down the rise in prices. According to recent statistics, from September to November last year, the monthly price indices for the province compared to the previous month showed increases of 4.9%, 2.1%, and 1.6% respectively, indicating a monthly decreasing trend in price increases.

	Over the past few months, the provincial government, based on in-depth investigations and research, has taken a series of measures to control prices. The main measures include:

		— Strengthening the management of market prices by various levels of government. The provincial government has issued two policy regulations on strengthening price management, requiring local governments to implement a system where the mayor and county magistrate are responsible for strictly managing prices.

		— Strengthening the administrative management of prices for market-regulated commodities, regulating the price differences for various commodities in procurement, wholesale, and retail; implementing ceiling prices for scarce commodities and important materials; and, in accordance with central regulations, implementing monopoly management for production materials such as fertilizers, pesticides, and plastic films.

		— Improving the management of circulation and operational links, strictly prohibiting speculative buying and selling for profit; important production materials and scarce commodities are only allowed to be wholesaled in one link within the same city.

		— Reinforcing price approval authority and implementing a system for price increase reporting and approval.

		— Organizing large-scale price inspections, using multiple forms and channels to strengthen the inspection, supervision, and management of prices. According to statistics from early last month, the province has handled over 8,800 cases of price violations, involving illegal amounts of over 41.7 million yuan, and confiscated over 24.8 million yuan.

	At the same time, various levels of government in the province have actively taken measures to develop production, establish agricultural and sideline product production bases, and organize the transportation and supply of scarce and suitable commodities to ensure effective supply. This has weakened the upward trend in market prices, kept the prices of state-priced products basically stable, and reduced the prices of market-regulated commodities (such as household appliances).

　　广东加强物价管理减缓涨价势头
    物价上涨幅度呈逐月下降趋势
    本报讯  记者梁兆明报道：近几个月来，广东省加强了市场物价管理，使全省物价涨势有所减缓。据近日的统计，去年９—１１月，全省市场各月物价总指数同上月的升幅相比，分别为４．９％、２．１％和１．６％，物价上涨幅度呈逐月下降趋势。
    连月来，省政府在深入调查研究的基础上，采取了一系列调控物价的措施，主要是：
    ——切实加强各级政府对市场物价的管理。省政府先后颁发了两个关于加强物价管理的政策规定，要求各地实行市、县长负责制，严格管好物价。
    ——加强对市场调节商品的价格行政管理，规定各种商品的进销差率、批零差率、购零差率；对市场紧缺的商品和重要物资，实行最高限价；按中央规定，对化肥、农药、农膜等生产资料实行专营。
    ——搞好流通和经营环节的管理，严禁买空卖空、就地倒卖牟利；重要生产资料和紧俏商品在同一城市只准一道环节批发。
    ——重申物价审批权，实行提价申报、审批制度。
    ——组织物价大检查，多形式、多渠道加强对物价的检查、监督和管理。据上月初的统计，全省已查处物价违法案件８８００多宗，违法金额４１７０多万元，没收２４８０多万元。
    同时，全省各级政府积极采取措施发展生产，建立农副产品生产基地，千方百计组织好紧俏商品和适销对路商品的调运和供应，保障有效供给，使市场物价涨势有所减弱，国家定价的产品价格基本稳定，市场调节的商品（如家用电器等）价格有所下降。
