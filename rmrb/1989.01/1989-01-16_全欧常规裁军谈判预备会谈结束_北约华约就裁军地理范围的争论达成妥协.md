The preparatory talks for conventional arms reduction in Europe have concluded. NATO and the Warsaw Pact have reached a compromise on the geographical scope of arms reduction.

The representatives of 23 NATO and Warsaw Pact countries participating in the preparatory talks for conventional arms reduction in Europe, after arduous efforts, finally reached a compromise on the dispute over the geographical scope of conventional arms reduction within NATO, specifically between Greece and Turkey. This marked the successful conclusion of the two-year-long preparatory talks, clearing the final obstacle for the final conclusion of the Vienna follow-up meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE).

Today, the ambassadors of the 23 NATO and Warsaw Pact countries to Austria signed the final resolution on the specific content and tasks of the negotiations to reduce conventional arms in Europe, which was reached during the preparatory talks this afternoon.

In the past week, Greece and Turkey had a serious dispute over whether the Mersin port in southern Asia Minor of Turkey and the surrounding areas should be included in the scope of conventional arms reduction in Europe. This dispute became the final obstacle to the timely conclusion of the Vienna follow-up meeting of the CSCE. According to the results of the negotiations with the Soviet Union, the southern part of Asia Minor in Turkey will be excluded from the scope of conventional arms reduction. However, Greece opposed this, arguing that the Mersin port has become a supply port for the Turkish occupying forces in northern Cyprus. If it is excluded from the scope of arms reduction, it will inevitably affect the military balance of power between Greece and Turkey in this region. The final compromise reached today is that this dispute will not be included in the final resolution of the preparatory talks but will be left to be resolved in the formal negotiations.

The preparatory talks for conventional arms reduction in Europe, attended by the two major military blocs of the Warsaw Pact and NATO, began on February 17, 1987. The aim was to replace the long-standing but fruitless negotiations on balanced force reductions in Central Europe, which had lasted for 14 years, with a new round of conventional arms reduction talks in Europe. The goal was to break the deadlock and promote the development of conventional arms reduction between East and West. During the two-year-long negotiations, the two sides overcame their differences on issues such as the geographical scope, types of weapons, verification measures, the format of the negotiations, and the relationship with other CSCE meetings. They reached a compromise on the content and format of this important negotiation. The final resolution adopted by the talks will be included in the content of the "Final Document" of the Vienna follow-up meeting of the CSCE.

　　全欧常规裁军谈判预备会谈结束
    北约华约就裁军地理范围的争论达成妥协
    新华社维也纳１月１４日电  参加全欧常规裁军谈判预备性会谈的２３个华约和北约国家的代表今天在这里经过艰苦的努力，终于就北约内部希腊和土耳其关于全欧常规裁军地理范围的争论达成妥协，从而圆满结束了历时两年的预备性会谈，为欧安会维也纳续会的最终结束扫清了最后的障碍。
    华约和北约２３国驻奥地利的大使们今天下午分别在预备性会谈中所达成的关于裁减全欧常规军备谈判的具体内容和任务的最后决议上签了字。
    近一周以来，希腊和土耳其就土耳其南部亚洲的梅尔辛海港及附近部分地区是否应该纳入全欧常规裁军范围发生严重争执，成为欧安会维也纳续会按期结束的最后障碍。根据同苏联谈判的结果，土耳其南部亚洲部分将排除在常规裁军范围之外，但希腊对此表示反对，它认为梅尔辛海港已成为土耳其北塞普路斯占领军队的军需港，如排除在裁军范围之外，势必影响希土在此地区的军事力量对比。今天双方最后达成的妥协结果是，这一争端将不写入预备性会谈所达成的最后决议中，而是留到正式谈判中去解决。
    由华约和北约两大军事集团参加的关于裁减从大西洋到乌拉尔之间全欧常规军备谈判的预备性会谈是１９８７年２月１７日开始的，其目的是通过举行新的一轮全欧常规裁军谈判来取代迄今长达１４年之久但无任何结果的中欧均衡裁军谈判，以期打破这一僵局，推动东西方在常规裁军领域的发展。会谈双方在长达两年的讨价还价中克服了彼此在有关全欧常规裁军谈判的地理范围、武器种类、核查措施和谈判的形式及同欧安会其它会议的关系等问题上的分歧，并就这一重要的谈判的内容和形式达成妥协。会谈通过的最后决议将纳入欧安会维也纳续会《最后文件》的内容。
