Title: The Debate Over France's "Minimum Service Law"

Over the past few months, France has seen a wave of strikes. The number of participants is not large, but the impact is widespread. The economic losses caused by the strikes are estimated to be over 10 billion francs. December is traditionally the busiest month for retail stores, but this year, some large stores saw a significant drop in sales, and small restaurants complained of a 20% decrease in customers. Some people have even taken legal action, demanding compensation from the postal service and public transportation companies for their losses.

In recent days, the Paris Metro lines have gradually resumed operations, and residents have breathed a sigh of relief. However, the issues raised by the strikes have not been resolved. A few days ago, Prime Minister Michel Rocard announced that the government will draft a "Minimum Service Law," which will be submitted to the parliament for discussion. The law will stipulate that public sector employees must ensure a minimum level of service during strikes and will not be allowed to completely halt operations. Otherwise, they will be deemed to be engaging in "illegal strikes." This proposal has immediately sparked intense reactions. Supporters say it is a good idea and that the majority should not suffer losses due to the actions of a minority. Opponents argue that it violates human rights and restricts the right to strike. The government emphasizes resolving conflicts through dialogue while still preparing to use legislative measures to manage the social environment.

France has a large public sector workforce, accounting for one-third of all employed individuals. According to the law, military personnel, police, and judicial staff do not have the right to strike, but for other public sector employees, there are no explicit regulations. The law only requires administrative heads to take measures to resolve issues, but in practice, no one has taken responsibility for handling strikes, resulting in a lack of guidelines for public sector strikes. Prime Minister Michel Rocard believes that some public sector strikes are "destructive," and he is willing to take full responsibility for addressing this issue.

The government's move aims to maintain the positive economic momentum. In 1988, France's economy is expected to grow by 3.5%, with inflation at around 3%, and unemployment is beginning to be controlled. Michel Rocard urges strikers to consider the bigger picture and not to sacrifice the future for short-term gains. He said that printing too much money will inevitably lead to inflation and worsen unemployment.

An official noted that France's economy lags behind Germany's, partly because France has too many strikes. Additionally, there are doubts about the efficiency of certain public sectors, and calls for reform are growing. This is essential for preparing for the single market in 1992. People hope that the "Minimum Service Law" will drive reforms in the public sector.

Reports indicate that public sector employees in the United States do not have the right to strike and must swear an oath to this effect. In West Germany, a significant portion of public sector employees also do not have the right to strike. Belgium, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and other countries also have explicit regulations prohibiting public sector employees from striking. It appears that France is considering following the practices of these countries.

Local opinion holds that achieving "minimum service" will not be easy. It will be constrained by historical and cultural traditions and will face opposition from powerful labor unions. From recent strike situations, it is evident that the strikers are not solely seeking wage increases. Many are uncertain about the rapid technological changes in industry and the impending single market, fearing that life will become more difficult after 1992. The demand for improved working conditions and job security reflects this psychological state.

### 法国“最低限度服务法案”之争

　　法国“最低限度服务法案”之争
    本报记者  张启华
    近几个月来，法国罢工浪潮不断。参加罢工的人数不多，但影响极广。罢工造成的经济损失估计在１００亿法郎以上。１２月历来是商店生意最好的月份，可是今年，一些大商店的营业额大幅度下降，小饭店也叫喊顾客少了两成。一些人还申诉法院，要求邮政、公交公司赔偿损失。
    近几天，巴黎地铁各线陆续复工，市民们松了一口气，但围绕罢工提出的问题并没有解决。几天前，罗卡尔总理表示，政府将拟订一项“最低限度服务法案”，提交议会讨论，法案将规定，公共部门在罢工中必须保证最低程度的服务，不允许因罢工而全部停止工作，否则将以“不合法罢工”论处。这个意向立刻引起激烈的反响。赞成者说，这是好主意，不能让多数人因少数人罢工而蒙受损失。反对者说，这违反人权，限制了罢工的权利。政府则强调通过对话解决冲突，同时仍准备用立法手段，治理社会环境。
    法国的公务员队伍庞大，占全部从业人数的１／３。根据法律，军队、警察和司法人员没有罢工权，但对于其他公务员，却无明文规定，只要求行政首长采取措施解决，而实际上谁也没有承担处理罢工的责任，结果公共部门的罢工问题无章可循。罗卡尔总理认为，公共部门的某些罢工是“破坏性”的，他愿意对此“承担全部责任”。
    政府此举旨在维护经济形势出现的好势头。１９８８年法国经济预计增长３．５％，通货膨胀约３％，失业开始得到控制。罗卡尔要求罢工者顾全大局，不要图眼前而牺牲未来。他说，钞票发多了势必引起通货膨胀，并使失业再趋严重。
    一位官员说，法国经济不如西德，原因之一就是法国的罢工太多。另外，人们对某些公共部门的效率也提出怀疑，要求进行改革。这对于迎接１９９２年的大市场是必不可少的。人们期望，“最低限度服务法”能推动公共部门的改革。
    据报道，美国的公务员是无权罢工的，每个人必须宣誓承诺做到这条。在联邦德国，相当一部分公务员也无罢工权利。比利时、瑞士、荷兰等国家也都明文规定公务员不准罢工。看来法国打算参照这些国家的做法。
    此间舆论认为，要实现“最低限度服务”不是件容易的事。它要受到历史、文化传统的束缚，还要遭到强大的工会组织的反对。从最近的罢工情况看，罢工人员并不全是为了增长工资，不少人对工业技术日新月异的变化和大市场的到来，心中无数，他们担心１９９２年以后的日子会更困难。要求改善工作条件，保障未来，正是这种心理的反映。
