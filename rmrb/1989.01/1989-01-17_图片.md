This is a giant New Year's card recently displayed at the Friendship Hall in Moscow, gifted by Americans to Gorbachev.

During a period of easing relations between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, 20,000 Americans presented this New Year's gift to Gorbachev, expressing their good wishes. When unfolded, the card is taller than a five-story building. It was transported by a Pan American Airways plane from New York to Moscow.
