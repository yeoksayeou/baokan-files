Life Shines in the Sea
— In Memory of Comrade Cheng Jun

In peaceful times, old comrades often gather, and seeing each other still healthy brings a sense of comfort. But when someone suddenly passes away, there is an irretrievable sense of loss. The passing of Comrade Cheng Jun is a case in point. This is not just because he was our comrade and fellow fighter, but because of his noble character and upright personality, which leave us with everlasting remembrance.

The storm of the Land Revolution swept the then 16-year-old Cheng Jun into the historical whirlwind of establishing the Honghu Soviet Area; the fires of the Red Army guerrilla warfare forged Cheng Jun's bold and passionate fighting style; during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, he was courageous and daring, achieving numerous victories; after liberation, as the Deputy Commander of the Air Force, he made immortal contributions to the country's air defense.

Here, we recall a few examples of Cheng Jun's hardworking and simple lifestyle, his integrity, and his strict adherence to discipline. Despite holding a high position, Cheng Jun maintained his proletarian character of hard work, simplicity, and connection with the masses for over 30 years after moving to the city. Before retiring to the second line, he insisted on visiting troops and staying at the grassroots level for many years. Everywhere he went, he inspected the barracks, positions, oil depots, underground command posts, and warehouses without exception; he never stayed in high-class hotels, never went sightseeing, never bought local specialties; he certainly never engaged in the wrongdoings of feasting, gift-giving, or collecting "souvenirs." He had long since stopped drinking strong alcohol due to health reasons. Once, during an inspection at a certain unit, two bottles of Maotai were placed on the table. He insisted on having the alcohol removed. The unit's leaders insisted otherwise, so he had his secretary pay for the alcohol at market price, considering it his "treat." Afterwards, he even had his secretary provide a receipt. One year, he inspected a national defense project at Yanshan Kou. The construction site was filled with sandstorms and biting cold, but he stayed overnight in a tent of the engineering troops. A nearby army division was his old "Fifth Brigade." The division's commander and political commissar heard the news and rushed to the site, urging the old commander to stay in the division's guesthouse to avoid the cold. He politely declined. To avoid further invitations from the division, he quietly left the site early the next morning. Unbeknownst to him, the division had already dispatched officers to guard several checkpoints. "The old commander must not leave without visiting his old unit today." He was "invited" by force to have breakfast with the division. From 1973, when he resumed work, until he retired to the second line, during the nine years, he spent every Spring Festival and New Year's Day with the soldiers in the suburbs of Beijing. His 70th birthday was celebrated in a certain missile brigade. On that day, the brigade's leaders had the cooks prepare a "birthday chicken," which was placed on the table, "to express their good wishes," but he sternly rejected it. The chicken was then eaten by his accompanying personnel. His official car was never allowed to be used by family members, children, or staff; however, he personally arranged for cars to pick up and drop off the parents of his secretaries, children who were sick, and wives who were hospitalized. He always encouraged several staff members who had joined the army from rural areas to study hard, and had his secretary "take charge" of their education. Those who met the conditions were allowed to apply to military academies and cultivate their talents. During his serious illness, he needed someone to take care of him. The organization planned to transfer his most satisfactory secretary back to take care of him. He learned that this comrade had graduated from a military academy and was about to enter the leadership cadre, so he decisively rejected the plan.

Cheng Jun always strictly demanded of his family members and children, not allowing any special treatment. In 1975, his youngest son was conscripted into the army. The military affairs department asked through his secretary, "What does the commander think? Where would be a suitable place to go?" Cheng Jun solemnly replied, "Go wherever you are assigned. If you must ask for my opinion, then go to Gansu, that place is tough." His son served his military duty in a desolate target range in Gansu. Cheng Jun never spoke about his children's work assignments, housing difficulties, promotions, or transfers. In his final moments, he left three instructions regarding his funeral: first, keep the funeral simple, do not disturb the Party Central Committee and the Military Commission leaders, so as not to interfere with their work; second, family members should not make any requests to the organization, so as not to cause trouble; third, do not place his ashes in Babaoshan, leaving the spot for other comrades. Such noble sentiments truly touch the heart. In his last speech at the Central Advisory Commission, he said: "As an old Party member and high-ranking cadre, one should strive to uphold discipline, be honest and upright, maintain integrity, and be clean." This is the sincere voice from his heart, and he spent his life embodying this golden advice. It is also a true reflection of his life. Such a noble and upright communist warrior, with a loyal and honest spirit, is not something we have too many of today, is it? A person's life is ultimately limited, but the people's cause is boundless. Comrade Cheng Jun, with his fiery life and crystal-clear character, dedicated himself to the boundless sea of the people's cause. His life, his career, his spirit, and his style will forever shine in the waves of this boundless sea.

　　生命在大海中闪光
    ——追忆成钧同志
    赵启民　朱云谦　谢雪畴
    在和平的岁月里，老战友时常相聚，每见彼此俱还健在，便觉有几分安慰，一旦遽尔永诀，顿时便有一种不可追回的痛失之憾。成钧同志的逝世即是一例。这并不仅仅因为他是我们的战友和同志，而是他的高尚情操和磊落人格，给我们留下了永久的思念。
    土地革命战争的风暴，把年仅１６岁的成钧同志卷进了创建洪湖苏区的历史狂飚之中；红军游击战争的烈火，熔铸就成钧同志叱咤风云壮怀激烈的战斗风格；抗日战争和解放战争中，他勇猛果敢，屡建战功；解放后，他作为空军副司令员，为国土防空事业立下了不朽功勋。
    这里仅就成钧同志艰苦朴素、廉洁奉公、严守纪律的事迹回忆几例。深居高位的成钧同志，进城３０多年来，一直保持着艰苦朴素联系群众的无产阶级本色。在退居二线以前，他坚持长年下部队蹲基层，每到一处，部队的营房、阵地、油库、洞库、仓库，地下指挥所，无所不去，无所不看；就是不住高级招待所，不游山玩水，不采购土特产；更不用说请客送礼，大吃大喝，捞“纪念品”之类的不正之风了。他因健康原因早已不再饮烈性酒了，有次在某部检查工作时，饭桌上摆了两瓶茅台，他要把酒撤掉，部队首长坚持不依，他便让秘书按市价付了酒钱，算他“请客”。事后还要让秘书交验收据。有一年他到燕山口检查一项国防工程。工地上风沙大作，清寒彻骨，他却住在工程兵连队的帐篷里过夜。驻在附近的陆军某师正是他过去工作过的“老五旅”。该师师长政委闻讯赶来工地，恳求老首长住进师招待所去避避风寒，被他婉言谢却。为了避免该师再来邀请，第二天清晨便驱车悄悄离开工地。不料该师早已派出干部“哨兵”，守候在几处路口。“老首长不来老部队一趟，今天出不了我师防地”。他被“武装邀请”去该师吃了一顿早饭。从１９７３年重新出来工作到退居二线以前的九年中，每年的春节佳日，他都是在北京郊区的连队同战士们一起度过的。七十大寿是在某导弹师里过的，当日该师首长让炊事员做了个“寿鸡”，端上饭桌，“表表心意”，遭到他的严词拒绝，结果鸡让随行人员吃了。他的专车从来不许家属子女和身边工作人员随便使用；但是秘书公务员的父母来队，孩子生病，爱人分娩住院，他都要亲自派车接送。他对身边几个从农村入伍的公务员，总是鼓励他们努力学习文化，责成秘书“包干”教学，条件具备的便让报考军事院校，培育成材。重病期间，他生活上亟需有人照料，组织上打算把他过去最满意的一位公务员调回来当秘书，他得知这位同志已从军事院校毕业，即将进入领导班子，便断然否定了。
    成钧同志对家属子女一向严格要求，不许有特殊化表现。１９７５年他的小儿子应征入伍，军务部门通过秘书问问“首长的意思，到什么地方去合适？”成钧同志严肃地回答：“该去哪便去哪里。一定要征求我的意见么，就去甘肃吧，那地方艰苦”。小儿子在甘肃一处荒寒的靶场里服完了兵役。他对子女的工作安排，住房困难，升迁调动等事，从来没讲过什么话。在他生命弥留之际，对自己的身后事遗言三条：一是丧事从简，不要惊动党中央和军委首长，免得干扰他们的工作。二是家属不要向组织提出任何要求，不给组织添麻烦。三是骨灰不放入八宝山，把位子让出来给别的同志。这种高尚的情怀，实在感人肺腑。他在中央顾问委员会上最后的一次发言中说：“作为一个老党员、高级干部，晚年应该做到严守纪律，廉洁奉公，一身正气，两袖清风。”这是发自他内心的金石之声，他用自己的一生对这句金玉良言作了最好的注释。也是对他一生的真实写照。这种高风亮节情操清远的共产主义忠诚战士，在当前，不是只嫌其少的吗？一个人的生命终归是有限的，只有人民的事业才是无涯的。成钧同志以他火一样炽烈的一生和水晶般皎洁的人品，献给了人民事业无涯的大海，他的一生都溶化在这个无涯的大海之中，他的事业，他的生命，他的精神，他的风格将永远在这大海的波涛中闪闪发光。
