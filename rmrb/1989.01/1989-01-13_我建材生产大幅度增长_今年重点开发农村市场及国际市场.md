China's building materials industry saw a significant increase in production in 1988, with the total industrial output value exceeding 50 billion yuan, marking a growth of approximately 13% compared to 1987. Despite facing challenges such as energy shortages, transportation constraints, and soaring raw material prices, the building materials industry achieved notable progress in production, construction, and technological advancements in 1988.

	* The production of major building materials saw substantial growth. Cement production reached 203.3721 million tons, an increase of 12.18% compared to 1987. Flat glass production amounted to 71.656 million weight boxes, a 27.91% increase from 1987.
	* The production capacity of major products increased. Cement saw a new production capacity of 19.9 million tons, while glass added 7.3 million weight boxes of new production capacity.

According to the State Bureau of Building Materials, the robust production and sales in the building materials industry in 1988 were influenced by the overheated economy. Since 60% of the building materials industry's output value is used in the construction sector, the economic adjustments in 1989 will have a certain impact on the building materials market. The State Bureau of Building Materials emphasized that the only path to stable development for the building materials industry is to open up new markets. The primary focus is to further develop the rural building materials market, followed by expanding into international markets. Given China's advantages in resources, labor, and existing technological equipment, there is significant potential for building materials exports to generate foreign exchange earnings.

　　我建材生产大幅度增长
    今年重点开发农村市场及国际市场
    本报讯  记者朱剑红报道：１９８８年我国建材工业总产值突破５００亿元，比１９８７年增长１３％左右。去年，在能源、运输、原材料紧张和价格猛涨的情况下，建材工业在生产、建设及技术进步方面均取得显著成效。
    ——主要建材产品产量有较大幅度增长，其中水泥产量达到２０３３７．２１万吨，比１９８７年增长１２．１８％；平板玻璃产量７１６５．６万重量箱，比１９８７年增长２７．９１％。
    ——主要产品的生产能力有所增加，水泥新形成生产能力１９９万吨；玻璃新形成生产能力７３０万重量箱。
    据国家建材局介绍，１９８８年建材生产产销两旺是受了经济过热的影响。由于建材工业产值的６０％是用于建筑业的，所以，今年的经济整顿将会对建材市场产生一定的影响。国家建材局负责人指出，建材工业稳定发展的出路只有一条：开辟新市场。首先是进一步开发农村建材市场，其次是开拓国际市场。从我国建材工业具有的资源、劳动力优势和现有技术装备来看，建材产品出口创汇的能力大有潜力可挖。
