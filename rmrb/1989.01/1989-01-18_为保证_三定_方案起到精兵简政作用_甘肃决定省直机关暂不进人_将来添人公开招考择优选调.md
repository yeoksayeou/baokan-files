To ensure the "three definitions" plan achieves the goal of streamlining administration and reducing personnel, Gansu decides to temporarily halt the recruitment of personnel for provincial-level agencies and to recruit and select personnel through open examinations in the future.

	To prepare for the upcoming reorganization of provincial-level agencies, the Gansu Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government recently issued the "Notice on Temporarily Halting the Transfer of Personnel into Provincial-level Agencies." The notice states that from January 1, 1989, until the "three definitions" plan for each unit is confirmed, party and government agencies at the provincial level are not allowed to transfer personnel from other units. After the "three definitions" plan for each unit is approved, if additional personnel are needed due to expansion or vacancies, the Provincial Organization Department or the Provincial Personnel Bureau will assist the unit in conducting open examinations and selecting the best candidates. This will ensure that the right people are chosen.

	The notice emphasizes that for any personnel transferred in violation of this notice, the Provincial Commission for Organization will not allocate salary funds, the Provincial Finance Department will not issue office expenses, and banks will not disburse cash.

　　为保证“三定”方案起到精兵简政作用
    甘肃决定省直机关暂不进人
    将来添人公开招考择优选调
    本报讯  为了给即将进行的省直机关机构改革做好准备，甘肃省委、省政府近日发出《关于省直机关暂缓调入人员的通知》。《通知》提出，从１９８９年１月１日起到各单位机构改革“三定”方案确定之前，省直党政群机关一律不准从外单位调入人员。各单位“三定”方案批准后，因扩编和缺编需要增加人员时，由省委组织部或省人事局协助进入单位，面向社会，公开招考，择优选调，把好进人关。
    《通知》强调，对违反本通知规定，擅自调入的人员，省编委不核拨工资基金，省财政厅不核发办公经费，银行不支付现金。
