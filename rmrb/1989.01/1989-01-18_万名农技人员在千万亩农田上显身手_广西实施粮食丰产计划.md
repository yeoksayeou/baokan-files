Ten thousand agricultural technicians are demonstrating their skills on ten million mu of farmland. Guangxi is implementing a grain high-yield plan.

People's Daily, Nanning — Reporter Zheng Shengfeng reports: Agricultural science and technology personnel in Guangxi are taking the initiative to implement a large-scale grain high-yield and increased income plan, with the hope of pushing grain production to a new level.

Guangxi's grain large-scale increased production comprehensive technology promotion and application plan, initiated and organized by the Autonomous Region Science and Technology Commission, is a social engineering project covering prefectures, cities, counties, and townships. Its main objectives and tasks include: organizing ten thousand agricultural science and technology personnel to guide or contract the cultivation of ten million mu of farmland, aiming to increase grain production by five hundred million jin.

To ensure the implementation of this high-yield plan, the Guangxi Autonomous Region Science and Technology Commission has signed contracts with various prefectures and cities as part of the "Spark Program" projects. Prefectures, cities, counties, and townships organize agricultural technology service teams composed of administrative leaders, professional agricultural technicians, and farmer technicians. These teams are responsible for promoting and applying a series of comprehensive grain-increasing technologies, from promoting high-yield varieties to scientific fertilization, pest control, and improving low- and medium-yield fields.

The initial implementation results show that various places have responded enthusiastically and welcomed the plan. So far, the contracted area in various prefectures and cities has exceeded the original plan of ten million mu, reaching fourteen million mu. The number of people participating in the agricultural technology service teams has also exceeded the planned ten thousand, reaching twelve thousand. Some prefectural and county magistrates personally serve as the commanders of this high-yield plan.

The Guangxi Autonomous Region government attaches great importance to the implementation of this high-yield plan and has allocated one million five hundred thousand yuan as special funds. Various prefectures and counties have also allocated several times this amount in special funds.

　　万名农技人员在千万亩农田上显身手
    广西实施粮食丰产计划
    本报南宁电  记者郑盛丰报道：广西的农业科技人员正着手实施大面积粮食丰产增收计划，有希望把粮食生产推上一个新台阶。
    广西这项由自治区科委倡导和组织实施的粮食大面积增产综合技术推广应用计划，是遍及地、市、县、乡的社会工程。它的主要宗旨和任务包括：组织一万名农科人员，去指导或承包一千万亩农田的粮食种植管理，实现增产粮食五亿公斤。
    为确保这一丰产计划的实施，广西区科委把它作为“星火计划”项目与各地市签订合同。地、市、县、乡组织由行政领导、专业农技人员和农民技术员相结合的各级农技服务队，负责从推广良种到科学施肥、防病除虫、改造中低产田等一系列粮食增产综合技术的推广应用。
    初步实施的结果表明，各地对此反应热烈，深表欢迎。至今，各地市签订合同的面积已突破原来一千万亩的计划而达到一千四百万亩；参加农技服务队的人数也超过一万名的设想而达到一点二万名。有的专员和县长亲自担任这一丰产计划的指挥长。
    广西区政府十分重视这一丰产计划的实施，专门拨出一百五十万元作为专项经费，各地市县也拿出数倍于此的专项资金。
