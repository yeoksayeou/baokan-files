Chongqing County promotes "rice field duck farming"

    Chongqing County in Sichuan Province has successfully experimented with "rice field duck farming." Last year, three townships in the county—Hejia, Liaoyuan, and Jinjiji—used 150 acres of rice fields to raise over 4,000 ducks. By autumn, the rice was ripe and the ducks were plump, allowing farmers to both increase production and income.

    "Rice field duck farming" involves placing ducklings that are seven days old into rice fields that are fenced on all four sides. During the day, the ducklings feed on weeds, insects, snails, and other aquatic organisms in the rice fields, and at night, they sleep in the fields. As the rice plants grow taller, the ducks also grow larger, eliminating the need for manual feeding. Before the rice is fully mature, the ducks are brought back home. According to experiments in Chongqing County, placing 25 ducks per acre can result in each duck weighing 1.5 kilograms by the time the rice is ripe. This can increase income by fifty to sixty yuan per acre, exceeding the net income from one acre of rice. Rice fields used for "duck farming" generally have fewer pests and weeds, and the fields can be plowed, which is beneficial for rice growth and yields better results.

    The Chongqing County People's Government attaches great importance to the experience of "rice field duck farming." This year, it is decided to promote this method in all 33 townships in the county, with each township raising ducks on 300 acres.

　　崇庆县推广“稻田露宿养鸭”
    本报讯  记者罗茂城报道：“稻田露宿养鸭”在四川省崇庆县试验成功。去年该县的何家、燎原、金鸡３个乡用１５０亩稻田共养４０００多只鸭子，到秋天，稻熟鸭肥大，农民既增产又增收。
    所谓“稻田露宿养鸭”，即把小鸭出生７天以后，放到四周被圈起来的稻田里放养。小鸭白天以稻田里的杂草、昆虫、田螺和其他水生物为食，夜晚在稻田里露宿。随着稻苗长高，鸭子也随着长大，用不着花人工去饲养。稻谷快成熟前，将鸭子收回家。据崇庆县试验表明，１亩稻田放养２５只，到稻熟前每只鸭子可长至１．５公斤，一亩稻田可增收五六十元，超过一亩稻谷的纯收入。“露宿养鸭”的稻田一般虫害少，没杂草，还可耕耘稻田，有利于水稻生长，增产效果较好。
    崇庆县人民政府很重视“稻田养鸭”经验。今年决定在全县３３个乡推广，每乡放养３００亩。
