The London Stock Exchange's Financial Times 100 Index rose 46.1 points on the 27th, closing at 2059.9. This is the first time since the global stock market crash on October 19, 1987, that the index has surpassed 2000 points.

Market traders believe that the news released on the 27th, which indicated a slight improvement in Britain's international balance of payments deficit for December, stimulated the stock market. This is because people believe that it shows the British economy is beginning to cool down, thus alleviating concerns about rising interest rates. Additionally, the upward trend in the New York Stock Exchange also played a driving role.

　　伦敦股票指数有了新的突破
    伦敦股票交易所《金融时报》一百种股票指数二十七日上升四十六点一点，收盘时达到二千零五点九点。这是自一九八七年十月十九日世界股市暴跌以来该指数第一次突破二千点。
    市场交易商认为，二十七日宣布的去年十二月份英国国际收支经常项目逆差状况稍有改善的消息刺激了股票市场，因为人们认为，这表明英国经济开始降温，从而使他们不再担心利率会上升。此外，纽约华尔街股市涨势也起了推动作用。
