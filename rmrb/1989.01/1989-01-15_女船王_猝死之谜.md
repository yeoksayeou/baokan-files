On the evening of November 17, 1988, Christina Onassis, known as the "female ship queen," and her fiancé Jorge attended a dinner party at the home of Greek textile factory owner Odysseas Heogalos in Buenos Aires. The event was a regular gathering of Greek expatriates in the city.

At around 9 PM, Christina sat at the head of the dining table. She was in good spirits and impressed everyone with her extensive knowledge of international business and finance. She only ate a small piece of smoked salmon and a bit of roasted beef. The "female ship queen" apologized to the host, explaining that she was maintaining her diet to keep her figure. Christina and the 43-year-old textile entrepreneur Jorge planned to stay in Argentina until December, then travel to Europe together, with plans to marry in March 1989.

The next morning, Christina went to the "Country Club" in Tortugas, staying at the home of her friend Dodro, intending to spend a few days in a pastoral setting. This was her second visit to Argentina in 20 days. She felt more at ease in the foreign country and had mentioned wanting to buy a house and rent a farm near Dodro's estate for the summer. As usual, her maid, Eleni Sirous, who had been taking care of Christina for 20 years, accompanied her to Argentina. On the morning of the 19th, the maid noticed that breakfast was getting cold, and the light in Christina's bedroom was still on. She and the landlady entered the bedroom and found Christina lying in the bathtub, already dead for several hours.

Christina was the daughter of Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis. When her father died in 1975, he left her a substantial fortune. However, wealth did not bring her happiness. Christina's parents separated when she was young, and this "rich but pitiful girl" was raised by her maid, playing with toys. At 37, Christina had been married four times. Her first husband was American Joseph Bolker; later, she married Greek Alexander Andreadis; Soviet Sergei Kouzoff was her third husband; and she had a daughter, Athena, with Frenchman Thierry Roussel. Now, Athena, who will soon turn four, is the sole heir to a $5 billion fortune, while Christina and Roussel separated in Switzerland in 1987. Christina's mother, Tina Livanos, committed suicide in 1973, and her brother Alexandros died in a plane crash the following year. These events were heavy blows to Christina.

The sudden death of the "female ship queen" Christina sparked many speculations. Initially, the judge deemed the death "suspicious." To unravel the mystery, the judge ordered an autopsy. Two foreign doctors quickly submitted a report, confirming that Christina died of acute pulmonary edema. The first people to come into contact with the body noticed two bloodstains on the sky-blue bedsheet: one above the waist and the other from blood coming from the mouth.

Stelios, the secretary-general of the Onassis Group, said that Christina's death was a "shock" to all the board members scattered around the world. They held an emergency meeting to discuss and decide on the current state and future direction of the "Onassis Empire."

　　“女船王”猝死之谜
    管彦忠
    １９８８年１１月１７日晚，人称“女船王”的克里斯蒂娜·奥纳西斯和她的未婚夫豪尔赫一起，到希腊籍纺织厂老板奥迪塞亚斯·赫奥加洛斯家里，主持布宜诺斯艾利斯希腊侨民定期举行的晚餐会。
    ９时许，克里斯蒂娜坐在餐桌一端的首席。她精神挺好，言谈中她对国际商业和金融业的渊博知识给人留下深刻的印象。她只吃了一小块熏鲑鱼和一丁点烤牛肉。“女船王”请主人原谅，因为她正坚持维持体形的食谱。克里斯蒂娜与４３岁的纺织企业家豪尔赫计划在阿根廷停留到１２月，然后一同到欧洲去，定于１９８９年３月份结婚。
    次日上午，克里斯蒂娜来到托尔图加斯的“乡间俱乐部”，住在朋友多德罗的家里，想过几天田园诗般的日子。这是２０天内她第二次到阿根廷。在异乡她觉得舒心一些，曾说要买一套房子，在多德罗庄园附近租一个庄园避暑。像往常旅行那样，２０年来一直照顾克里斯蒂娜的女管家埃莱尼·西罗斯陪她来阿根廷。１９日早晨，女管家眼看早饭就要凉了，克里斯蒂娜的卧室里仍然亮着灯。她和女房东走进卧室，发现克里斯蒂娜躺在澡盆里，已经断气好几个小时了。
    克里斯蒂娜是希腊船王亚里斯多德·奥纳西斯的女儿。１９７５年父亲去世时留给她一笔巨额财富。可是，财富并没有给她带来幸福。克里斯蒂娜少年时代父母就分居了，这个“富有而可怜的女孩”由女管家照顾，摆弄玩具。
    ３７岁的克里斯蒂娜曾经四次结婚。第一个丈夫是美国人约瑟夫·波尔克；后来她与希腊人亚历山大·安德雷阿迪斯结婚；苏联人谢尔盖·考佐夫是她的第三位郎君；她与法国人蒂里·罗塞尔结婚后，生下阿瑟娜，现在，将满４岁的阿瑟娜成了５亿美元财产的唯一继承人，而克里斯蒂娜与罗塞尔１９８７年在瑞士分居。克里斯蒂娜的母亲蒂娜·利瓦诺斯１９７３年自杀，哥哥亚历杭德罗第二年因飞机失事身亡。这些对克里斯蒂娜是沉重的打击。
    “女船王”克里斯蒂娜的猝死，曾引起人们的许多猜测。起初法官认为“死亡可疑”。为了解开疑团，法官下令对尸体进行解剖。两名外国医生很快提出了报告，证实克里斯蒂娜死于急性肺水肿。最初接触到尸体的人注意到，天蓝色的床单上有两处血污，一处在腰部之上，另一处是嘴巴吐血造成的。
    奥纳西斯集团的秘书长斯特里奥斯说，克里斯蒂娜的死，对分散在世界各地的董事会全体成员来说是一次“休克”，他们召开了紧急会议，讨论和决定“奥纳西斯帝国”的现状与发展方向。
