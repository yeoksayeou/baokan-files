Don't Let Newspapers Become "Bundle Papers"

	I recently discussed the issue of newspaper subscriptions with a few township heads and township party committee secretaries. They referred to the current state of newspapers as "bundle papers."

	"Bundle papers"? I was puzzled and listened carefully. It turns out that the current delivery of newspapers is really problematic. The secretary and head of one township said: The 13th Party Congress has already concluded, but the newspapers reporting on the opening have only just arrived. The situation from township to village and from village to village groups is even worse. Sometimes newspapers go uncollected for months, piling up in the township post office or village office. When it's time to collect them, there's a whole bundle, hence the term "bundle papers."

	Currently, the difficulty in newspaper subscription work is significant. What is the main issue? The increase in newspaper prices is one reason, but in many places, the primary issue is the inefficiency of the delivery process. People subscribe to newspapers to read them in a timely manner. If subscribing to a daily newspaper means only being able to read a "monthly" or even a "quarterly," who would want to spend this money in vain?

	The problems with newspaper delivery naturally involve the postal service. However, the staff at the grassroots postal offices also have their own difficulties. For example, in the county where I am located, with a population of 660,000, 25 townships, and over 300 administrative villages, most of which are in mountainous areas, there are only about 40 delivery personnel. It's impossible for them to handle everything. Due to financial constraints, it is not possible to increase the number of delivery personnel. The county postal director frankly complained: The grassroots level of the postal system retains too little profit, has too little vitality, and receives too little support and investment from higher levels. Our work is very difficult to develop.

	Numerous facts have shown: The prosperity or decline of newspaper circulation is largely dependent on the quality of delivery. If the "bundle papers" situation does not change, the enthusiasm of rural residents to subscribe to newspapers will be dampened. How to improve rural delivery work? Relevant departments should pay high attention and take measures!

### 莫教报纸变“抱纸”

　　莫教报纸变“抱纸”
    与几位乡长、乡党委书记谈及报刊订阅问题，他们称如今的报纸是“抱纸”。
    “抱纸”？我大惑不解，细听端详。原来是现在的报刊投递实在成问题。有个乡的书记、乡长说：党的十三大已经闭幕了，刊登开幕消息的报纸才送来。乡至村、村至村民组的情况更糟糕，有时报纸一月数月没人送，都堆在乡邮电所或村部里，到拿的时候一大抱，成了“抱纸”。
    当前，报刊征订工作难度颇大，难在何处？报刊价格上涨是一个原因，但在许多地方，最主要的原因，是投递环节不畅。订报是为了及时看报，如果订日报只能看“月报”甚至“季报”，谁还愿意花这份冤枉钱？
    报刊投递上的问题，自然与邮电部门有关。可基层邮电局、所的同志也有自己的苦处。例如我所在的县，６６万人口，２５个乡镇，３００多个行政村，多半是山区，总共才有４０多个投递员，怎么也顾不过来。因财力所限，无法再增加投递员。县邮电局长直言不讳地抱怨说：邮电系统基层留利太少，活力太小，上面对基层的扶持、投资也太少，我们的事业很难发展。
    大量事实已经表明：报刊发行的兴与衰，在很大程度上取决于投递的好与坏。“抱纸”的状况不改变，农村群众订报的积极性就会受挫。如何改进农村投递工作，有关方面应该高度重视，拿出措施来！
