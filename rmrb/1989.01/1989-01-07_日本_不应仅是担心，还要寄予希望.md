Regarding the future of the European large market and the potential emergence of regional bloc protectionism, Japan has expressed concerns. Many Japanese companies have proposed various ideas and strategies. However, Japan also has high hopes for the economic integration of the European Community. Given the EC's principle of "mutual benefit," Japan is studying how to further open its market to EC member states to ease trade friction between Europe and Japan.

Our reporter in Tokyo, Yu Qing, reports: Recently, the reporter interviewed Mr. Yamamoto Jun'o, Director of the Policy Research Division and Chief Researcher at the Mitsubishi Research Institute, regarding the issue of the European large market.

Yamamoto believes that the establishment of an internal market by the European Community is aimed at enhancing its own competitiveness. The EC member states feel that their overall economic and technological strength is slightly inferior to that of the United States and Japan, and they have a sense of crisis about falling behind. Therefore, they seek to enhance their strength through new combinations and strive to catch up with the United States and Japan.

The EC faces many urgent issues in areas such as tariffs, agricultural policies, and a unified currency. From a more macro perspective, there are two main issues. First, externally, if the large market is established and reduces external connections, rejects external capital, technology, and cooperation, can the large market itself develop smoothly? Second, internally, how to coordinate the overall leadership of the large market with the sovereignty of each member state. In a recent discussion, Japanese scholars raised these types of questions to European scholars and did not receive satisfactory answers. However, the establishment of the large market is inevitable. It can be imagined that after the large market is announced in 1992, there may not be a complete strategy, and it can only be continuously improved in the development process.

Regarding the impact of the large market on the world economy, the most concerning issue is the protectionism fostered by regional bloc formation. This concern is widespread in the business community. However, most scholars believe that the large market will also have a positive impact on the world economy. Therefore, one should not only be worried but also hopeful.

After the EC realizes the large market, the export of goods from developing countries will not change, but the question is whether the export of goods from developing countries to the EC can maintain the current momentum. How the economic relations between the two sides will change after the establishment of a unified market is also a matter of concern.

Regarding the strategies Japan has taken towards the large market, Yamamoto pointed out that from the perspective of enterprises, the strategy is to enter the EC member states before the large market is established, set up bases, and establish production facilities locally; establish joint ventures with local enterprises, etc. According to statistics, by the end of 1987, Japan had nearly 300 manufacturing enterprises in the EC alone. Although the EC side has repeatedly stated that the establishment of the large market will not exclude foreign enterprises, most Japanese enterprises still start from the assumption of the "worst-case scenario" and take precautions by formulating strategies.

The government is also concerned. Prime Minister Takeshita visited Europe twice last year and repeatedly proposed to the leaders of the EC member states that the large market should not become an exclusive regional economic bloc. Given that the EC side emphasizes "mutual benefit," the Japanese government is also studying how to further open the market to enterprises from EC member states and cooperate with the EC in economic development in third countries. By deepening economic relations, easing economic friction, and seeking a relaxed policy from the EC for Japanese enterprises to enter the Western European market after the establishment of the large market.

### 日本“不应仅是担心，还要寄予希望”

　　日本“不应仅是担心，还要寄予希望”
    内容提要：对于未来的西欧大市场，以及可能出现的地区集团化的保护主义，日本方面不无担心。许多日本企业已提出多种设想和对策。但日本也对欧共体经济一体化寄予希望。鉴于欧共体的“互惠”原则，日本正研究如何进一步向欧共体成员国开放市场，以便缓和欧日贸易摩擦。
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    本报东京电　记者于青报道：记者最近就欧洲大市场问题采访了日本三菱综合研究所政策研究室专门研究部部长、首席研究员山元顺雄先生。
    山元认为，欧共体建立内部大市场是为了增强自身的竞争力。欧共体成员国感到自己在经济、科技的整体实力上，比美国、日本略逊一筹，有落后的危机感。因此，寻求通过新的组合方式，增强实力，力争赶上美日两国。
    欧共体在税率、农业政策、统一货币等方面面临许多急待解决的问题。从比较宏观的角度看，主要有两方面的问题。一是对外而言，如果大市场建立后，减少对外联系，拒绝外来的资本、技术和合作，大市场本身能否顺利发展。二是对内而言，怎样协调大市场的整体领导权与成员国各自的主权。在最近举行的一个讨论会上，日本学者向欧洲学者提出这类问题，没有得到圆满的回答。但是，建立大市场已是势在必行。可以设想，一九九二年宣布建立大市场后，很可能没有完整的实策，只能在发展进程中不断完善。
    关于大市场对世界经济的影响，最令人担心的是地区集团化助长的保护主义。这一担心，在企业界普遍存在。但大多数学者认为，大市场对世界经济也会产生积极作用。因此，不应该仅仅是担心，还要寄予希望。
    欧共体实现大市场后，对发展中国家的商品出口不致发生变化，问题在于发展中国家对欧共体的商品出口是否还能保持现在的势头。建立统一市场后，双方经济关系将怎样变化，也是令人关注的。
    关于日本方面对大市场采取的对策，山元指出，从企业方面来说，其对策是在大市场建立之前，先打入欧共体成员国，建立据点，在当地建立生产厂家；与当地建立合资企业等。据统计，截至一九八七年底，单是在制造业方面，日本已有近三百家企业打入了欧共体。尽管欧共体方面一再表示，建立大市场后不排除外国企业。但日本多数企业还是从设想出现“最坏局面”出发，未雨绸缪，制定对策。
    政府方面也不无担心。竹下首相去年两度访欧，向欧共体成员国首脑多次提出，希望大市场不要成为排他的地区集团经济圈。鉴于欧共体方面强调“互惠”，日本政府也在研究向欧共体成员国企业进一步开放市场，并且同欧共体在第三国发展经济合作，通过加深经济关系，缓解经济摩擦，以求得欧共体在建立大市场后对日本企业进入西欧市场采取宽松的政策。
