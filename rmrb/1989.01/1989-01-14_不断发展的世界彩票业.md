Many countries use various forms of fundraising to raise funds for social welfare and other public welfare projects. Among these, issuing lottery tickets (also known as prize draws) is a relatively common way to attract idle social funds. To date, more than 100 countries around the world issue lottery tickets. These countries include capitalist nations, socialist nations, economically developed countries, and developing countries. The economic and social benefits generated by the lottery industry have led to its continuous development.

Issuing lottery tickets primarily serves to raise idle social funds, accumulating small amounts to form a significant fund, which can be used for various projects. In Europe, sports lotteries have a long history, and the proceeds are mainly used for sports projects. For example, Bulgaria and the Soviet Union. In 1986, the Soviet Union sold 1.5 billion lottery tickets, with a total income of 5.7 billion rubles. It is estimated that by 1990, the Soviet Union's annual lottery income will reach 10 billion rubles. The United States issues various types of lottery tickets each year, with an average annual income of $14 billion. Panama, with a population of only about 2 million, has been issuing lottery tickets since 1901. Its lottery company's annual turnover reaches $200 million, with a considerable net income each year.

Some countries use lottery proceeds for the welfare of the disabled or the poor, or to establish public welfare projects. This form of fundraising is praised by people because it promotes humanitarianism and helps to foster a good social atmosphere of mutual care and support. For example, Japan also has a type of school-issued lottery, which is collected through the student union from the pocket money of primary and secondary school students, thereby educating students to care for the weak and the unfortunate. Of course, issuing lottery tickets to some extent can also induce and encourage people's gambling, speculative, and adventurous psychology. In some capitalist societies, lottery tickets have become a form of gambling. However, as long as the state controls the issuance approval rights, the face value of the lottery tickets is not large, and people voluntarily purchase them, taking from the people and using it for proper purposes, the negative effects can be controlled.

Regarding the lottery drawing cycle and the amount of prize money, the situations vary in different countries. Capitalist countries generally use high prize money methods to increase lottery sales, with some even using super prizes to stimulate lottery sales volume. For example, in the United States, the highest lottery prize can reach $45 million. In socialist countries, the highest prize amount is often restricted. Some experts believe that, from the current development trend, setting multiple medium-level prizes is more effective. This way, more people can benefit, and it can help solve some problems that ordinary people want to address but lack the ability to do so.

### 不断发展的世界彩票业

　　不断发展的世界彩票业
    很多国家以各种形式的募捐来筹集资金，开展社会福利和其他公益事业。其中，发行彩票（又称有奖募捐）是一种吸收社会游资较为普遍的形式。迄今，全世界已有１００多个国家发行彩票。其中有资本主义国家，也有社会主义国家；有经济发达国家，也有发展中国家。彩票业所产生的经济效益和社会效益使得这种行业不断发展。
    发行彩票主要可以筹集社会闲散资金，集腋成裘，聚沙成塔，汇成数目可观的基金，用于开展多种事业。在欧洲，体育彩票历史较久，彩票收益大都用于体育事业。如保加利亚、苏联等。苏联在１９８６年售出１５亿张彩票，收入额达５．７亿卢布。预计到１９９０年，苏联彩票年收入可达１０亿卢布。美国每年发行多种彩票，年平均收入为１４０亿美元。巴拿马现人口只有２００多万，从１９０１年开始发行彩票。它的彩票公司每年营业额高达２亿美元，每年纯收入相当可观。
    有些国家利用彩票收入用于残疾人或贫穷人的福利事业，或建立公益事业，这种募捐赢得人们的赞许，因为它发扬人道主义精神，有助于社会形成一种互相关心、互相扶助的良好风尚。如日本还有一种学校发行的彩票，是通过学生会募集中、小学生的零用钱，以此来教育学生要关心弱者和不幸者。当然，发行彩票也在某种程度上诱发、助长人们的侥幸、投机和冒险心理。在一些资本主义社会，彩票还成为一种赌博。但是，只要国家控制发行审批权，彩票面额不大，自愿选购，取之于民，用途正当，消极作用是可以受到制约的。
    在彩票开奖周期，奖金多少等问题上，各国情况有所不同。资本主义国家一般都采用高额奖金办法，这样可以增加彩票的销售，有的甚至以超级大奖来刺激彩票销售量。如在美国，彩票最高奖高达４５００万美元。在社会主义国家，往往限制奖金的最高额。某些专家认为，从当前发展趋势来看，多设中等水平奖金的作法效果比较好。这样做可以使较多人受惠，并能解决一些普通人想解决而又无能力的问题。
