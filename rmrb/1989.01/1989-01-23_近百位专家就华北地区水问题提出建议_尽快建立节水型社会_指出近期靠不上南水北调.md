Nearly 100 experts discuss water resource management in North China

	Nearly 100 experts and scholars proposed suggestions on water issues in North China at a symposium on the rational development and utilization of water resources (focusing on North China) held by the Chinese Academy of Sciences on January 22. They jointly suggested to the Chinese government and society: "Strengthen water resource management and establish a water-saving society."

	These experts and scholars include 19 academicians such as Tǔ Guāngzhì, Yè Dǔzhèng, Zhāng Guāngdòu, Shī Yǎfēng, Zēng Qìngcún, and Xiè Yìbǐng, as well as scientists and professors from the State Planning Commission, State Science and Technology Commission, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Ministry of Water Resources, Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Construction, State Seismological Bureau, relevant provinces and cities, and universities.

	The experts pointed out in their suggestions that the term "North China" here refers to the four provinces and municipalities of Shanxi, Hebei, Beijing, and Tianjin, and the northern part of Shandong and Henan provinces along the Yellow River. This region is an important grain and cotton production base and energy base in China, with developed industries, dense population, and limited water resources. The total water resources in this region are only 51 billion cubic meters, accounting for 1.8% of the national total. However, the population and arable land account for 11% and 15% of the national total, respectively. The per capita and per-acre water resources are less than 1/6 and 1/10 of the national average, respectively. Currently, the development of river runoff and groundwater in this region ranks first in the country, but it still cannot meet the growing demand, affecting the lives of some residents and industrial production. The area of farmland irrigation is shrinking, many rivers are drying up, reservoirs are drying up, groundwater levels are dropping significantly, water bodies are polluted, and the contradiction between water supply and demand is becoming increasingly sharp. If this problem is not solved in time, it will have a significant impact on the country's economic construction, people's lives, and even social stability.

	The experts pointed out that in addition to natural factors such as water resource conditions, some man-made factors have also exacerbated the water supply and demand contradiction in North China. The main man-made factors include irrational industrial structure and industrial layout, lack of attention to water source construction, lack of effective water-saving measures, and short-term behavior of some officials in office. All these problems are related to the current system and investment policies, reflecting that our management of water resources is at a relatively low level.

	The experts pointed out that on the other hand, it should be seen that the water supply and demand contradiction in North China is unbalanced in terms of region and time. As long as water resource management is strengthened and a water-saving society is established, it is possible to alleviate the current water supply and demand contradiction. Many experts believe that it is not reliable to rely on the construction of the South-to-North Water Transfer Project to solve the water resource supply and demand contradiction in the short term. In fact, if we immediately launch a large-scale South-to-North Water Transfer Project, it is difficult to solve the problem in terms of financial and material resources, and there is also no sufficient scientific feasibility. Of course, scientific research on the South-to-North Water Transfer Project should continue.

	The experts explained that the so-called water-saving society is to maximize the rational development and utilization of local water resources through strengthening water resource management; to determine a reasonable industrial structure and layout based on water resource conditions; to fully utilize modern science and technology and traditional practical technologies in industrial and agricultural production and people's lives, to improve the effective utilization rate of water as much as possible; to limit the unlimited demand for water in society, to meet the needs of social and economic development with the least amount of water, and to achieve long-term coordinated development of resource development, social economy, and ecological environment.

	The experts said that agriculture is a major water user, accounting for more than 80% of the total water use. Currently, many farmlands still use the old method of irrigation from thousands of years ago—flood irrigation. This production method that does not consider water prices must be changed, and it is also the area with the most potential for water saving. The potential for industrial water saving is also great, especially for the treatment and reuse of wastewater, which can not only reduce the supply of new water but also reduce environmental pollution.

### 近百位专家就华北地区水问题提出建议  尽快建立节水型社会  指出近期靠不上南水北调

　　近百位专家就华北地区水问题提出建议    
    尽快建立节水型社会
    指出近期靠不上南水北调
    本报北京１月２２日讯  记者王溪元报道：在今天结束的中国科学院地学部主持召开的水资源合理开发利用（华北地区为主）研讨会上，近百位专家学者联合向我国政府和全社会提出建议：“强化水资源管理，建立节水型社会”。
    这些专家学者包括涂光炽、叶笃正、张光斗、施雅风、曾庆存、谢义炳等１９位学部委员及国家计委、国家科委、中国科学院、水利部、地质矿产部、农业部、建设部、国家地震局和有关省市、高等院校的科学家和教授等。
    专家们在建议中指出，此处所谓华北地区，指山西、河北、北京、天津４省市和山东、河南两省的黄河以北地区。该地区是我国重要的粮棉生产基地和能源基地，工业发达，人口密集。但是，该地区水资源总量仅５１０亿立方米，占全国的１．８％，而人口和耕地分别占全国的１１％和１５％，人均、亩均水资源量都不及全国平均水平的１／６和１／１０。现在该地区河川径流开发和地下水开发程度均居全国之首，但仍不能满足日益增长的需求，使一些居民生活和工业生产受到影响，农田灌溉面积萎缩，许多河川断流、水库枯干，地下水位大幅度下降，水域污染，水的供需矛盾日益尖锐，如不及早解决，定会使国家的经济建设、人民生活，以至社会安定受到重大影响。
    专家们指出，华北地区水的供需矛盾，除水资源条件等原因之外，某些人为因素也加剧了这个矛盾。人为因素主要指产业结构和工业布局不合理、不重视水源建设、缺少得力的节水措施、某些在职干部的短期行为等。所有这些弊病都与现行体制和投资政策有关，反映出我们对水资源的管理处于较低水平。
    专家们指出，另一方面应当同时看到，华北地区水的供需矛盾，在区域上和时序上是不平衡的，只要强化水资源管理，认真建立节水型社会，是可以缓解当前水的供需矛盾的。许多专家认为，在近期内靠兴建南水北调工程来解决水资源供需矛盾是靠不住的。事实上，我们马上大兴南水北调工程，不仅在财力物力上难以解决，而且在科学的可行性上也还没有十分把握。当然，对南水北调问题的科学研究，还应继续进行。
    专家们解释，所谓节水型社会，就是通过强化水资源管理，最大限度地合理开发利用当地水资源；根据水资源条件，确定合理的产业结构和布局；在工农业生产和人民生活中，充分利用现代科学技术和传统实用技术，尽可能提高水的有效利用率；限制社会对水的无限需求，以最少的用水量，满足社会经济发展的需要，使资源开发、社会经济与生态环境得到长期协调发展。
    专家们说，农业是用水大户，占总用水量的８０％以上。目前许多农田的灌溉方式还是几千年前的老法——大水漫灌，这种不计水价的生产方式必须改变，也是节水最有潜力的所在。工业节水的潜力也很大，特别是污水处理回用，不仅可减少新水供应，还可减少环境污染。
