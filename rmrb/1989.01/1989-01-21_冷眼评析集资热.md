Recently, various regions have seen a surge in fundraising activities. But is fundraising good or bad? This requires a sober analysis.

In recent years, the rapid growth rate has affected the entire economic sector. Whether it is long-term products or short-term industries, they all compete for funds, all wanting to go up without coming down. This is like sharing a cake. If everyone adds a bit more, the fat will continue to accumulate for the overweight, while the malnourished will remain so. This economic adjustment aims to tighten control over long-term projects and save limited funds to support effective social supply.

However, the fundraising frenzy does not discriminate. Some enterprises that should be "slimming down" have also joined the fundraising ranks, even offering high-interest rates to attract investors. This has caused a significant shift in bank deposits in some places, disrupting the macroeconomic controls of financial institutions. Such desperate measures to "weather the storm" risk undermining the state's policy of tightening credit, curbing economic overheating, and adjusting the industrial structure.

It is one-sided to either completely deny or fully endorse fundraising. Currently, the tightness of funds indeed poses significant challenges for enterprises. Even with the state's policy of supporting short-term industries, money is still insufficient. Recently, even key enterprises like Anshan Steel and Tangshan Steel have faced financial difficulties, struggling to continue operations. In these fundamental industries that affect national and public livelihoods, mobilizing the public for fundraising to prevent production slumps is necessary. However, it is hoped that neighboring "fat cats" do not join the frenzy.

　　冷眼评析集资热
    雨晴
    近来，各地纷纷兴起一股集资热。到底集资好不好？对此需要冷静加以分析。
    几年来，过快的增长速度牵动了整个经济界。无论是长线产品，还是短线产业，都争抢资金，都想只上不下。这好比分吃蛋糕，如果二一添作五，胖子、瘦子各咬一口，那么脂肪过剩者会继续“过剩”，而营养不良者还是“不良”。这次调整经济，就是要卡紧长线，节省下有限的资金扶持社会有效供给。
    而集资热不分青红皂白，一些企业本该“减肥”，可是也夹进集资行列，甚至不惜给出钱者以高额利息，一时搅得有些地方的银行存款大搬家，干扰了金融机构的宏观调控。如此千方百计“渡难关”，国家抽紧银根、遏制经济过热、调整产业结构的方针岂非有落空之虞。
    笼统地全盘否定集资，或肯定集资，都失之偏颇。当前，资金紧张确实给企业带来很大困难。即便国家在资金供应上采取了支持短线的政策，钱还是不够。最近，甚至像鞍钢、唐钢这样的重点企业也因财力拮据，难以为继。在这类关系国计民生的基础产业里，发动群众集资，防止生产滑坡，还是必要的，只是希望左邻右舍的“胖子”们不要赶来凑热闹。
