The discipline inspection departments of Daqing Oilfield adhere to the principle of both setting red lights and providing guidance, offering policy consultations for issues that base-level units are unsure about. By the end of last December, discipline inspection departments at various levels in the oilfield had resolved over 1,400 difficult problems through dialogues with factory directors and managers.

The discipline inspection committee of Daqing Oilfield believes that the "red light" of party discipline is an absolute no-go zone. Recently, a manager of a certain company was found to have accepted 2,000 yuan in bribes and violated personnel regulations to favor relatives. The bureau's discipline inspection committee, despite interference, launched an investigation, removed the manager from their post, and gave them a serious party warning. Since last year, the bureau has corrected and handled 388 cases involving the misuse of power, bureaucratism, and infringement on the interests of the masses, with 147 individuals receiving disciplinary actions.

Discipline inspection personnel and factory directors and managers sit on the same bench, finding ways that neither violate the rules nor leave them without a path forward. They work together with enterprises to overcome difficulties and share risks.

In June last year, during a dialogue between the bureau's discipline inspection committee and the director of the 7th Oil Extraction Plant, the director mentioned that the most difficult issue to resolve was the problem of entertainment expenses. During a recent financial audit, 91 small funds were eliminated, but within a short period, 30 new small funds appeared. Due to the lack of dedicated entertainment funds at the base level, small funds became the primary source of entertainment expenses. The discipline inspection department did not avoid this contradiction. After coordinating with the financial department, they required units with small funds to establish proper accounts and use them reasonably.

After the Technical Operation Company's Machine Repair Plant in the oilfield collaborated with a factory in Liaoning to repair cars, there were reports that the factory leadership was using the collaboration as a cover to make money. The company's discipline inspection committee discovered through an investigation that 500 yuan from the director's fund was not taken by the director; some office workers received 300 yuan under the guise of part-time work. The bureau and factory-level discipline inspection committees made it clear: the director deserves to take the reward for the development of the enterprise and should take it with a clear conscience. Those who should not take the reward must return it in full, and the discipline inspection committee's opinion was read to all employees. By the end of November last year, the factory's output value surged from 200,000 yuan the previous year to 1,000,000 yuan. The director remarked, "Without the support of the discipline inspection committee, our reform would not have continued."

After news of the discipline inspection committee helping enterprises solve problems spread, factory directors with uncertainties flocked to seek advice.

　　办案手不软　解难心真热
    大庆油田纪检部门被厂长视为知己
    本报讯  大庆油田纪检部门坚持既亮红灯又指路，为基层单位把握不准的问题作政策咨询。到去年１２月初，油田各级纪检部门通过和厂长、经理对话，解决疑难问题１４００多个。
    大庆油田纪委认为，党的纪律“红灯”，是决不能闯的。前不久，某公司经理受贿２０００余元，并违犯人事制度为亲属开绿灯，局纪委排除干扰，立案调查，免去其经理职务，并给予党内严重警告处分，通报全局。前年以来，这个局纠正和处理了以权谋私、官僚主义、侵犯群众利益等问题３８８件，１４７人受到党纪处分。
    纪委干部和厂长、经理们坐在同一条板凳上，找到既不闯红灯，又有路可走的办法，和企业同闯难关，共担风险。
    去年６月，局纪委同采油７厂的厂长对话时，厂长说，最难解决的是招待费问题。前一阶段的财务大检查中取缔了９１个小金库，没过多久又出现３０个小金库。由于基层单位没有专用的招待费，小金库成了招待费的主要来源。纪检部门没有回避这一矛盾，他们与财务部门联系后，要求有小金库的单位建帐建卡、使用合理。
    井下技术作业公司机修厂与辽宁某厂联营搞汽车维修后，有人反映厂领导以联营为名捞钱。公司纪委从调查中了解到，从厂长基金中提取的５００元奖励基金，厂长不敢拿；有的机关干部以兼职为名领取３００元。局、厂两级纪委明确指出：厂长对企业发展有功，应理直气壮拿奖金，不该拿奖金的干部要如数退回，并向全体职工宣读了纪委的意见。到去年１１月底，这个厂的产值从前年的２０万元猛增到１００万元。厂长感慨地说：“没有纪委的支持，我厂的改革进行不下去。”
    纪委帮企业解难题的消息传开后，厂长们有拿不准的问题，纷纷登门请教。
