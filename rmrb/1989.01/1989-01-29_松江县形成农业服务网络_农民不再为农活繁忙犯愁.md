Farmers in Songjiang County no longer worry about the busy agricultural work. A three-tier agricultural service network with ten thousand people has been established throughout the county, providing various services before, during, and after production, which are highly welcomed by the farmers.

Situated on the outskirts of Shanghai, Songjiang County has developed a certain scale of sideline and secondary industries. After implementing the household contract responsibility system, many farmers are reluctant to give up their land but also lack the time and energy to invest in agricultural production. To prevent agricultural decline and encourage farmers' production enthusiasm, Songjiang County has gradually established and improved the agricultural service system since 1984. Currently, more than 300 villages in the county have service teams, and each township has set up an agricultural company. The county agricultural bureau focuses on personnel training and technical promotion guidance. From plowing, irrigation, pest control, to harvesting, transportation, and seed supply, the county basically implements a series of services. During the farming season, tractors, transplanting machines, and irrigation machines are busy in the fields; during the harvest season, transportation vehicles arrive at the village entrance to help farmers transport grain and agricultural products. These services reduce the labor intensity of farmers, improve production efficiency, and effectively promote the coordinated development of agriculture, sideline, and secondary industries in the county.

While providing services to farmers, various agricultural service teams have strengthened internal management and self-construction. They have generally established economic responsibility systems, service contracting systems, and post responsibility systems, and signed service agreements with village committees, implementing the "three definites and one implementation" responsibility system for service personnel, service responsibilities, service charges, and service personnel remuneration. Some townships have also tried the method of linking part of the service personnel's remuneration with production, which has motivated the enthusiasm of the service providers.

According to the current characteristics of rural work, the agricultural service teams in Songjiang County work in agriculture during busy times and engage in sideline and secondary industries during idle times, developing the tertiary industry according to local conditions. Each township's agricultural service company has set up 75 economic entities, with a production value exceeding 20 million yuan last year. This has strengthened the economic power of the agricultural service teams and reduced the economic burden on townships and farmers.

　　松江县形成农业服务网络    
    农民不再为农活繁忙犯愁
    本报上海电  记者吕网大报道：松江县的农民如今不再为繁忙的农活犯愁。一支万人的三级农业服务网络已遍布全县，产前、产中、产后的各种服务，深受广大农民的欢迎。
    地处上海市郊的松江县工副业生产已小有规模。实行家庭联产承包责任制后，许多农户不愿放弃土地，但也没有更多的时间和精力投入农业生产。为了不使农业萎缩，鼓励农民的生产积极性，松江县从１９８４年起逐步建立和完善了农业服务体系。目前全县３００多个村都有服务队，乡乡建立了农业公司，县农业局侧重于人员培训和技术推广指导，从机耕、排灌、植保、收割到运输、良种供应，全县基本上实行了系列化的服务。耕种时节，拖拉机、插秧机、排灌机忙在田头；收获季节，运输车辆又开到村口，帮助农民运送粮食和农副产品。这些服务工作减轻了农户的劳动强度，提高了生产效率，有效促进了全县农副工三业全面协调发展。
    在为农户提供服务的同时，各农业服务队也加强了内部管理和自身建设，普遍健全了经济责任制、服务承包制和岗位责任制，并与村民委员会签订服务协议，定服务人员、定服务职责、定收费标准、落实服务人员报酬的“三定一落实”责任制，有的乡还试行服务人员部分报酬与产量挂钩的分配办法，调动了服务者的积极性。
    根据现时农村工作特点，松江县农业服务队忙时务农，闲时从事工副业，因地制宜发展第三产业，各乡镇农业服务公司办起经济实体７５个，去年产值超过２０００万元，壮大了农业服务队的经济实力，也减少了乡村集体和农民的经济负担。
