Recently, some banks have experienced a shortage of funds, a decrease in savings deposits, and an increase in the amount of currency in circulation. Despite various banks strengthening savings promotion, improving services, and striving to expand the types of savings, as well as vigorously promoting value-preserving savings, "three favorites" (color TVs, refrigerators, gold jewelry) prize savings, and "three favorites" physical goods savings, the situation of declining savings deposits has not changed. People cannot help but ask, where has the money gone?

One of the reasons for this situation is that some enterprises are raising funds at high interest rates from society. According to investigations, units such as the Nanchong Cotton Textile Mill, Nanchong Region Silk Mill, Nanchong County Food Company system, Nanchong County Supply and Marketing Cooperative system, Nanchong Longmen Middle School, and Nanchong County People's Hospital, in order to solve the difficulties in fund turnover, have used interest rates that are more than double the bank's interest rates to motivate employees to participate in fundraising. It is understood that for every 100 yuan invested by the employees of Nanchong County Longmen Middle School, after one year, the principal and interest can amount to 200 yuan. Many units' employees not only earn high interest but also participate in year-end profit sharing.

Due to the significant profits from participating in high-interest fundraising, many employees have withdrawn their savings from banks and invested in enterprises. Some employees, due to low income, have even borrowed money from relatives and friends to invest in units. As a result, some units have had to regulate the maximum fundraising amount for general employees, mid-level cadres, and factory directors (managers). According to statistics from the Nanchong County Industrial and Commercial Bank Cotton Mill Savings Office, in November 1988, this savings office had 72 cases of fixed-term deposit customers making early withdrawals, 24 cases of cumulative deposit customers making early withdrawals, 23 cases of only-child special savings customers making early withdrawals, and 112 cases of current savings account closures. Even the newly established value-preserving savings had 48 cases of early withdrawals, totaling 279 account closures and a decrease of 240,000 yuan in savings deposits.

In order to stabilize the economic order, we suggest that relevant units strengthen fund management, strictly implement the approval authority and procedures for fundraising, and resolutely stop the behavior of privately dividing state and collective funds under the guise of fundraising and profit sharing.

　　各方高息集资　银行存款骤减
    最近一段时间，一些银行资金紧缺，储蓄存款下降，货币投放量增加。尽管各银行加强储蓄宣传，改进服务，努力扩大储蓄种类，大力开展保值储蓄、“三俏”（彩色电视机、电冰箱、黄金首饰）奖售储蓄、“三俏”实物贴水储蓄，仍改变不了储蓄存款下降的局面。人们不竟要问，钱到哪里去了呢？
    产生这种情况的原因之一，在于部分企业向社会高息集资。据调查，南充棉纺织厂、南充地区绢纺厂、南充县食品公司系统、南充县供销社系统、南充龙门中学校、南充县人民医院等单位，为了解决资金周转上的困难，以高出银行利率一倍以上的利息来调动职工参加集资的积极性。据了解，南充县龙门中学职工每集资１００元，一年到期后，连本带息可得２００元。不少单位职工集资不仅得高息，而且还要参加年终分红。
    由于参加高息集资获利较大，不少职工纷纷从银行取出存款，投向企业。有的职工由于收入少，还向亲友借款投向单位。这样一来，部分单位还不得不规定一般职工、中层干部和厂长（经理）的最高集资额。据南充县工商银行棉纺厂储蓄所统计，１９８８年１１月，这家储蓄所整存整取客户提前支取的达７２户，零存整取客户提前支取的２４户，独生子女专项储蓄客户提前支取的２３户，活期储蓄消户１１２户，就连才开办不久的保值储蓄提前支取的已多达４８户，各项共计消户２７９户，储蓄存款下降２４万元。
    为了稳定经济秩序，我们建议有关单位加强资金管理，严格执行集资的审批权限和程序，坚决制止以集资分红为名，私分国家和集体钱财的行为。
