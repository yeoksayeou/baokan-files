The women's national football teams of China and Japan have faced off multiple times in recent years, with the Chinese team maintaining a perfect record but never scoring more than two goals in a single match. Today, the Chinese team scored four goals, and with a final score of 4:0, it seems that the two teams are no longer on the same level.

Japan's history of women's football development is similar to that of China. Currently, Japan boasts over 400 women's football teams of varying levels, and they hold the All-Japan Women's Football Championship every year. In the upcoming seventh Asian Women's Football Championship scheduled for this year and the women's football competition at the eleventh Asian Games next year, the Japanese team will be a major opponent for China. The Japanese players are agile, tenacious, and their short-passing attacks are well-organized. Their starting lineup has been stable for many years, and their coordination is quite harmonious. However, their smaller stature limits their speed and playing style.

The Chinese team has an advantage in physical condition and their technical skills are also not lacking. As long as they are confident and play freely, they have a good chance of defeating the Japanese team. Today's match is a clear example.

In the 12th minute of the first half, China's number 7, Wu Wei Ying, made a cross from the wing, and number 13, Niu Li Jie, scored with a shot in front of the goal. The attacking route was very clear. The Japanese team worked hard to organize their attacks, even pushing most of their players over the halfway line, but this only gave China the opportunity for quick counterattacks. Coach Shang Rui Hua believes that in the second half, Wu Wei Ying scored twice and Niu Li Jie added another goal, all by seizing the opportunity, utilizing their absolute speed advantage, and breaking away from the defenders' interception, snatching the ball from in front of the goalkeeper. It seems that this is the tactical style that the Chinese team should persist with. Shang Rui Hua told reporters that Sun Qing Mei of the Chinese team was absent due to injury, and the left-wing attack was not effective. The few new players currently in use are still inexperienced. Of course, even the more experienced players need to improve their handling of key balls. In the first half, the Chinese team made a cross, and the ball landed in front of the Japanese goal. Chen Xia missed a good opportunity because she turned too slowly. Four or five players from both teams fell to the ground, and seven or eight legs pushed the ball to within a meter of the goal. Such an opportunity should have been scored. The Chinese women's football team needs to continue to hone their skills to challenge the world's top teams.

　　打出速度以后
    ——中日女足比赛场记
    中日两国国家女子足球队近几年多次交手，中国队保持全胜纪录，但赢球从未超过两个。今天，中国队连灌四球，就４∶０的结果来说，似乎两队水平已不在同一等级。
    日本开展女子足球运动的历史与我国差不多，现在号称有４００多支不同水平的女子足球队，每年都要举行全日本女足锦标赛。在预定今年举行的第七届亚洲女足锦标赛和明年的第十一届亚运会女足比赛中，日本队都是中国队的主要对手。日本队员动作灵活，作风顽强，短传进攻有章有法，且主力阵容已形成多年，配合相当默契。不过，身材矮小限制了她们的速度和打法。
    中国队在身体条件上有优势，技术也不差，只要自信，放开打，赢日本队还是有点把握的。今天的比赛就是明证。
    上半时第１２分钟，中国队７号吴伟英边路传中，１３号牛丽杰门前铲射破网，进攻线路十分清楚。日本队努力组织攻势，甚至大军压过半场，但反给中国队造成快速袭击背后的机会。中国队主教练商瑞华认为，中国队下半时吴伟英两次破门和牛丽杰再添一分，都是抓住战机，发挥绝对速度的优势，摆脱对方后卫拦截，从守门员身前抢出来的。看来，这正是中国队应当坚持的战术风格。商瑞华对记者说，中国队孙庆梅因伤缺阵，左路进攻不得力，现在起用的几名新手还嫩，没有经验。当然，既使是老一点的队员，在关键球的处理上也还有待提高。上半时中国队一次传中，球在日本队门前落地，陈霞因为转身不快错过良机，双方四五个人倒地，七八条腿将球塞在门前不到一米远的地方，这样的机会早该得分了。中国女子足球队要向世界强队挑战，还需不懈地磨练。
