Former head coach of the Chinese women's volleyball team, Li Yao, recently stated that the team's loss in the Olympics was due to the coaches "not leading the team well," and that as the head coach, he "bears the primary responsibility."

Li Yao made these remarks during a conversation with coaches Dong Zhuangqiang and Cheng Shuqing. A reporter from this news agency was invited to listen to the conversation.

The three coaches felt deeply regretful about the Chinese women's volleyball team's loss in the Olympics. On January 16, the team held a farewell gathering for the three coaches and seven players who were leaving. The coaches felt it necessary to clarify some of the issues surrounding the team's performance in the Olympics before their departure.

Li Yao reviewed the work done over the past two years, saying: "From the beginning, we established the policy of 'relying on the old to lead the new.' We kept five veteran players with the goal of winning the Olympics and having them train the new players." Coach Dong Zhuangqiang added: "When we took over, our tasks were clear: to complete the Olympics mission and to cultivate new talent. Keeping the veteran players was a decision made by our coaching team. Initially, the main lineup consisted of five veterans and one newcomer. By the time of the Olympics, it had become four veterans and two newcomers, achieving our original plan."

During the conversation, the coaches also mentioned that losing the Olympic championship during their tenure left them with a lifelong regret. They believed that, from the perspective of a coach's responsibilities, the most profound lesson was the lack of strict management and training. The coaching team did not do their job well.

Coach Cheng Shuqing said: "We were appointed coaches through an evaluation process. Now, with the coaching responsibility system in place, since the team has been entrusted to us, we should manage and lead the team well. However, we have not fulfilled our responsibilities." Li Yao said: "Over the past two years, the veteran players have overcome many difficulties and given their all. Losing in the Olympics cannot be blamed on them."

Dong Zhuangqiang believed that conflicts between athletes and coaches during training are a normal part of teaching and learning, and this phenomenon exists in other teams as well. He said: "From the beginning, we proposed that coaches and athletes should 'understand each other and work together,' but it seems this issue has not been resolved well."

In their conversation, they not only conducted self-criticism but also engaged in comradely criticism. Dong Zhuangqiang believed that in managing the team, head coach Li Yao lacked the necessary resolve, was not strict enough in management, and avoided conflicts. Cheng Shuqing also mentioned that after the team's visit to the Soviet Union and before the Olympics, the team was lax and training was not rigorous. Li Yao said: "Before the Olympics, the coaches were not clear about the athletes' mental state and did not do any guiding work. The players carried mental burdens while playing, which inevitably affected their performance." He believed that to win in major competitions, one must rely on a solid foundation of good habits and skills cultivated over time, not on luck or chance.

"The Chinese women's volleyball team must restore its image mainly through its own team-building efforts." This is the expectation of the three coaches for the adjusted Chinese women's volleyball team. They believe that the Chinese women's volleyball team is still an excellent team and one of the world's top teams.

### 三教头卸任之际吐肺腑之言  中国女排仍要自强不息

　　三教头卸任之际吐肺腑之言    
    中国女排仍要自强不息
    新华社北京１月２６日电（记者李贺普、蔡君清）原国家女排主教练李耀先日前说，中国女排在奥运会上失利，是“教练没有带好这个队”，作为主教练他“负主要责任”。
    李耀先是在与教练董传强、程蜀琦一起交谈时讲这番话的。本社体育记者应邀旁听了这次交谈。
    中国女排奥运会失利，３位教练感到痛心。１月１６日，中国女排举行了３位教练和７名队员离队的欢送会。教练们认为，他们有必要在离队之前对外界议论的有关女排奥运会前后种种问题作个交代。
    李耀先回顾两年来的工作时说：“从一开始，我们就确定了‘以老为主，以老带新’的方针。留下５名老队员，目的是为打奥运会，并且靠她们带新队员”。教练董传强说：“我们接班时任务很明确，一是完成奥运会任务，二是培养新生力量。留下老队员是我们教练班子决定的。开始时，主力阵容为五老带一新，等到奥运会时变为四老带二新，实现了我们最初的设想。”
    教练们在交谈中还提到，奥运会冠军丢在他们执教期间，给自己留下了终身的遗憾。他们认为，从教练的职责来讲，最深刻的教训是对队伍管理不严，训练不严。教练班子没有做好工作。
    教练程蜀琦说：“我们是通过考评会担任教练的。现在实行教练负责制，既然把队伍交给了我们，我们理应管好带好这支队伍，但是我们没有尽到自己的职责。”李耀先说：“两年来老队员克服了不少困难，尽了最大的努力。在奥运会上输了球，不能责怪她们。”
    董传强认为，在训练中运动员和教练员有矛盾是教与学的正常现象，这种现象在其它队也存在。他说：“我们一开始就提出教练和运动员之间要‘互相理解，协同一致’，现在看来这个问题一直解决得不好。”
    他们在交谈中，不仅作了自我批评，而且开展了同志式的批评。董传强认为，在管理队伍上主教练李耀先缺乏魄力，不敢严格管理，回避矛盾。程蜀琦也谈到，去年女排访问苏联回来到奥运会大赛的一个多月里，队伍松散，训练也未抓紧。李耀先说：“奥运会前，教练对运动员思想情况不是很清楚，更没有去做引导工作。队员背着思想包袱打球，必然打得不正常。”他认为，要在重大比赛中取胜，必须靠平时养成的过硬的作风和打下的坚实技术基础，靠意外和侥幸是不行的。
    “中国女排要恢复自己的形象，主要靠队伍本身的建设。”这是三位教练对调整后的中国女排的期望。他们认为，中国女排仍然是一支优秀的队伍，是世界强队之一。
