Wuning Township in Shandong Province's Muping County, known as the "foreign exchange champion township," achieved an export value of over 31 million yuan in 1988, with a per capita foreign exchange earnings of 521 US dollars.

In 1987, Wuning Township had a per capita foreign exchange earnings of 484 US dollars, making it the "strongest township" in Shandong Province in terms of per capita foreign exchange earnings. In 1988, with the support of provincial, municipal, and county foreign trade departments, they arranged eight "processing, assembling, compensating, and repairing" projects, prioritizing township-owned enterprises for production. Among the 16 township-owned enterprises, 8 were engaged in export production, accounting for over 70% of the township's total export value.

Previously, the township had overlooked some small projects. In 1988, they developed shrimp farming, poultry farming, handicrafts, agricultural by-products, and machinery processing for export. The number of export products increased by more than 10 varieties compared to the previous year, shifting from a single-product structure to a diversified one, thereby enhancing market adaptability. Over the year, Wuning Township invested over 10 million yuan in the foreign trade sector, importing advanced equipment from the United States, Japan, and Canada. They expanded a 3,000-square-meter carpet workshop, built shrimp ponds, a 10,000-unit broiler breeding farm, and a cold storage facility that meets export standards. The investments made that year yielded results immediately, directly increasing the export value by over 8 million yuan.

　　武宁乡人均创汇超五百美元
    本报讯  山东省牟平县“创汇状元乡”武宁乡去年出口额突破３１００万元，人均创汇５２１美元。
    武宁乡１９８７年，全乡人均创汇４８４美元，是山东省人均创汇最多的“壮元乡”。１９８８年，他们在省市县外贸部门的支持下，先后安排了８个“三来一补”项目，优先安排乡办企业生产。在１６个乡办企业中，有８个从事出口生产，完成外贸出口额占全乡的７０％多。
    过去，这个乡对一些小项目看不上眼，１９８８年，他们先后发展了养虾、养鸡、手工艺品、农副产品、机械加工等出口项目，出口产品比上年增加了１０多个品种，出口产品结构由单一化趋向多元化，增强了市场应变能力。一年来，武宁乡先后投资１０００多万元发展外贸业，先后从美国、日本、加拿大引进先进设备，扩建了３０００平方米的工艺毯车间，建起了虾场、一万套种鸡场和符合外贸出口标准的冷藏厂，当年投资当年见效，直接增加出口额８００多万元。
