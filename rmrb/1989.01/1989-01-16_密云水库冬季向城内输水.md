Miyun Reservoir in Beijing began its first winter trial of supplying drinking water to the city on New Year's Day this year.

Beijing's winter water supply has traditionally relied on groundwater. In recent years, due to excessive extraction, the groundwater level has dropped significantly, resulting in a 1,000 square kilometer area of groundwater depression. To alleviate the drinking water shortage, Beijing decided to start diverting water from Miyun Reservoir to the city this winter. Currently, Miyun Reservoir is supplying 200,000 cubic meters of water daily through a 25-kilometer canal to Huairou Reservoir. The water from Huairou Reservoir is then piped into the city through the water supply system of the Ninth Water Plant.

　　密云水库冬季向城内输水
    据新华社电  北京密云水库今年元旦首次在冬季向城内试验输送饮用水。
    北京城区的冬季用水过去主要靠地下水，近些年因开采过量地下水位下降严重，北京已形成１０００平方公里的地下漏斗区。为缓解饮用水困难，北京市决定在今冬从密云水库引水入城。现在，密云水库以每日２０万立方米的输水量，经过２５公里的渠道向怀柔水库输水。怀柔水库的水再通过水源九厂的管道引入城内。
