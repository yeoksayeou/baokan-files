In Guangzhou, along Huangpu Road in the Yuncun area, there is a luxurious restaurant called Yuan Zhang Restaurant. The sign above the door prominently displays the words "Deep Mountain Wild Delicacies" in bright colors. In front of the door, giant salamanders (Chinese giant salamanders) and monkeys, which are rare animals, are kept. Inside the restaurant, large framed menus with artistic calligraphy list various dishes and their prices:

	Stewed Dishes (serves 2-4 people):
	Stewed Cat Owl (Owl) 300 yuan, Stewed Southern Snake (Python) 90 yuan, Stewed Monkey Penis 160 yuan, Stewed Sea Dog (Giant Salamander) 90 yuan, Stewed Leopard Cat Penis 160 yuan, Stewed Flying Tiger (Bird of Prey) 90 yuan, Stewed Monkey Brain 160 yuan, Stewed Flying Eagle 90 yuan.

	Main Dishes:
	Braised Large Southern Snake 70 yuan, Braised Mountain Treasure 70 yuan, Braised Mountain Goat Hotpot 36 yuan, Braised Mountain Delicacy 70 yuan, Braised Pangolin 70 yuan, Braised Leopard Cat 70 yuan, Braised Flying Tiger 56 yuan, Braised Sea Dog 56 yuan.

	From the above menu, it can be seen that this restaurant illegally operates with 12 different kinds of endangered protected animals. As the restaurant owner wrote on the menu: "Exclusive operation, a full range of mountain delicacies and wild flavors." This is a genuine slaughterhouse for endangered animals. According to local residents, because this restaurant specializes in rare animals that are not available elsewhere, many Hong Kong and Macau compatriots and wealthy customers from Guangzhou flock to the restaurant by taxi as soon as night falls.

	On December 13th of last year, relevant departments in Guangdong Province conducted a surprise inspection of this restaurant based on a tip from the public. In the restaurant's kitchen, they found the following dead animals that are under state protection as second-class protected species: a half-eaten short-tailed monkey, 3 monkey heads, 0.8 kilograms of giant salamander pieces (from 4 animals), 2 kilograms of pangolin meat, 1.75 kilograms of eagle meat, and 2.25 kilograms of python meat. Additionally, there were 2 live short-tailed monkeys and 5 giant salamanders. According to the restaurant owner, Guan Baoyuan, in the past year, the restaurant illegally purchased, slaughtered, and sold about 5-6 monkeys, 30 kilograms of giant salamanders, and 20-30 pangolins.

	After this case was exposed, Guan Baoyuan made various excuses and even tried to bribe officials in the forestry police system to seek leniency. The public will wait to see how the relevant authorities will handle this case.

　　源章酒店是滥杀珍稀动物的屠场
    在广州黄埔大道员村地段路旁，有一间装潢颇为豪华的酒家——源章酒店。大门上“深山野味”几个彩色大字异常醒目，门前放养着大鲵（娃娃鱼）和猴类等珍稀动物。走进店里，墙壁上大镜框里镶着用美术字写的各种菜牌和价格：
    炖品（供２—４人吃）：
    炖猫山鹰（猫头鹰）３００元、炖南蛇（蟒蛇）９０元、炖猴鞭１６０元、炖海狗（娃娃鱼）９０元、炖豹狸鞭（豹猫）１６０元、炖飞天虎（属猛禽）９０元、炖猴脑１６０元、炖飞鹰９０元。
    正菜：
    红烧大南蛇７０元、红烧山瑞７０元、红烧山羊煲３６元、煀山珍７０元、红烧穿山甲７０元、煀豹狸７０元、红烧飞天虎５６元、煀海狗５６元。
    从以上菜牌统计，该店违法经营的珍稀保护动物品种多达１２个。正如店老板在菜谱上所写的：“独家经营、山珍野味大全”。这是一家名副其实的滥杀珍稀动物的屠场。据当地群众反映，由于该店专门经营别处吃不到的珍稀动物，所以，每当夜幕降临时，不少港澳同胞和广州有钱的客人便坐着“的士”纷至沓来。
    去年１２月１３日，广东省有关部门根据群众举报，突击检查了这家酒店。从该店厨房搜出已被杀死的、属国家明令保护的二类动物有：吃了一半的短尾猴１只、猴头３只、大鲵碎块０．８公斤（分属４条）、穿山甲肉２公斤、鹰肉１．７５公斤、蟒蛇肉２．２５公斤。此外还有活口短尾猴２只、大鲵５条。据该店老板关柏源本人供认，近１年来，该店非法购进、滥杀和售出猴类五六只、大鲵３０公斤左右、穿山甲２０—３０只。
    此案被揭露后，关柏源百般狡辩，并托人到林业公安系统去要挟求情。对此，人们将拭目以待，看看有关单位将如何处理。
