The Strait Cannot Separate Us; On New Year's Day, We Think of Each Other

The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference's Committee for the Promotion of Reunification and the China Association for the Promotion of Peaceful National Reunification

Held a Symposium to Commemorate the 10th Anniversary of the Publication of the NPC Standing Committee's Message to Compatriots in Taiwan

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 31, 1988 (Reporter Wang Chi) The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference's Committee for the Promotion of Reunification and the China Association for the Promotion of Peaceful National Reunification held a symposium this afternoon in the Great Hall of the People to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the publication of the Message to Compatriots in Taiwan by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

The symposium was presided over by Qian Weichang, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Chairman of the Committee for the Promotion of Reunification, and President of the China Association for the Promotion of Peaceful National Reunification.

Chen Shiyuan, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Vice Chairman of the Committee for the Promotion of Reunification, and President of the China Association for the Promotion of Peaceful National Reunification, extended New Year greetings to the participants on behalf of the Association and the Committee. He said that ten years ago, the publication of the Message to Compatriots in Taiwan marked the beginning of improving relations between the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. Since then, leaders of the Communist Party of China have proposed a series of constructive and specific suggestions on the issue of reunification. In 1984, Comrade Deng Xiaoping clearly proposed the idea of "one country, two systems" to resolve the issue of reunification between Taiwan and the mainland. These correct policies and ideas have been actively supported by the people of Taiwan, leading to significant changes in the relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, and the beginning of a harmonious atmosphere. This is the result of the joint efforts of the people on both sides and an irreversible historical trend.

Chen Shiyuan said that the authorities in Taiwan have so far remained narrow-minded, imposing restrictions on exchanges between the two sides, and their actions have not been satisfactory. We deeply regret this. We believe that China belongs to all Chinese people, and the revitalization of the nation and the reunification of the country are matters of common concern to all Chinese people. He introduced that, in order to adapt to the needs of the current era, the China Association for the Promotion of Peaceful National Reunification was established three months ago. We are willing to engage in sincere dialogue with people from all walks of life at home and abroad, regardless of their beliefs, parties, religions, or ethnicities, to discuss the issue of reunification and jointly explore the path to peaceful reunification of China, so as to promote the early realization of this sacred mission. He said that we are working to promote extensive and comprehensive exchanges between the people on both sides in areas such as family visits, tourism, trade, science and technology, education, academia, culture, arts, and sports, to enhance mutual understanding. Chen Shiyuan expressed his hope for the future of China's peaceful reunification. He said, let us join forces with people from all walks of life at home and abroad, gather the wisdom of the Chinese nation, and together build a prosperous, strong, peaceful, democratic, and unified China.

Wan Guoqian, a member of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Vice Chairman of the Committee for the Promotion of Reunification, said in his speech that in recent years, various forms of civilian trade exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have developed considerably. Now, both the mainland and Taiwan are seeking economic development. Why can't the authorities in Taiwan abandon their prejudices and open up direct trade? The two sides of the Taiwan Strait should complement each other's strengths and weaknesses, help each other, and promote the economic development of the mainland and Taiwan, contributing to the reunification and prosperity of the motherland. He hoped that political parties, organizations, and business people from both sides of the Taiwan Strait would jointly promote the process of peaceful reunification and see more and more Taiwanese businesspeople come to the mainland to do business and invest in factories.

Zhong Shitong, a member of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and an old sports worker, said that the Message to Compatriots in Taiwan is a document with great national appeal. Under the promotion of this document, the development of sports relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait has also made great progress in the past 10 years. In international sports competitions, athletes from both sides are like brothers, blessing each other and supporting each other, and many warm scenes are unforgettable. He said that the mainland advocates sports exchanges between the two sides without any conditions. The mainland warmly welcomes sports workers from Taiwan to visit and participate in the Asian Games, National Games, and all sports activities that Taiwanese compatriots are willing to participate in. The mainland is also willing to send athletes to Taiwan to participate in various sports activities at any time. We hope that the authorities in Taiwan will take the Olympic spirit and principles as the standard, remove man-made barriers, and allow athletes, coaches, and sports workers from both sides to travel freely and jointly develop the sports cause of the motherland.

Li Shiji, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and a famous Beijing opera performer of the Cheng School, said that since the publication of the Message to Compatriots in Taiwan, cultural and artistic exchanges between the two sides have been conducted semi-publicly. We hope that these exchanges and visits will be made public and direct, and that Beijing opera workers from Taiwan will be able to perform on the mainland stage as soon as possible, while we can also present our artistic achievements to the Taiwanese audience as soon as possible, and together protect and develop Beijing opera, this national cultural heritage.

Huang Wei, an 85-year-old member of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said in his speech, "I remember the teachings of Mr. Sun Yat-sen: 'Unity' is the hope of all the people of China. If we can be united, all the people of the country will enjoy happiness; if we cannot be united, we will suffer harm." The current authorities in Taiwan are taking small steps to open up, which cannot adapt to the world trend of peace and development and reform, nor can it adapt to the urgent desire of the descendants of the Yellow Emperor for national reunification. The authorities in Taiwan set limits for themselves with the mentality of "anti-communism and rejection of peace" and "enemy consciousness," creating man-made obstacles for the development of cross-strait relations, attempting to maintain a long-term separation, which not only violates national and ethnic interests but also is not conducive to the stability and development of Taiwan. He said that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait should seize the favorable domestic and international conditions today to accomplish the great cause of reunification. As a student of the first class of the Whampoa Military Academy, he hoped that the Whampoa students in Taiwan would strive to be "unifiers" and promote national reunification.

Li Yanji wrote a poem on the spot at the meeting, which included the lines, "The Strait cannot separate us; on New Year's Day, we think of each other. When China is unified, we will sing and toast together."

Guo Pingtan, Qian Sanqiang, Zhang Lianyun, Xiao Gan, and others spoke at the symposium.

　　海峡难阻隔　元旦共相思
    全国政协祖国统一联谊会、和平统一促进会
    座谈纪念人大《告台湾同胞书》发表十周年
    新华社北京１９８８年１２月３１日电  （记者王炽）全国政协祖国统一联谊委员会和中国和平统一促进会，今天下午在全国政协礼堂举行座谈会，纪念全国人大常委会《告台湾同胞书》发表十周年。
    座谈会由全国政协副主席、全国政协祖国统一联谊委员会主任、中国和平统一促进会会长钱伟长主持。
    全国政协副主席、全国政协祖国统一联谊委员会副主任、中国和平统一促进会会长程思远代表促进会和统一联谊委员会，向参加座谈会的同志致以新年问候。他说，十年前《告台湾同胞书》的发表，是改善海峡两岸人民关系的起点；自此以后，中共领导人又就统一问题提出了一系列富有建设性的具体建议；１９８４年邓小平同志明确提出用“一国两制”的构想来解决台湾与大陆的统一问题。这些正确方针和构想得到台湾人民的积极支持，从而使海峡两岸的关系发生了令人瞩目的变化，开始出现了祥和的气氛。这是两岸人民共同努力的结果，也是不可逆转的历史潮流。
    程思远说，台湾当局迄今仍囿于成见，对两岸交往施加限制，其所作所为未尽人意，吾人对此深表遗憾。我们认为，中国是所有中国人的中国，民族振兴，国家统一，是所有中国人共同关心的大事。他介绍说，为了适应当前时代需要，特在三个月前，成立了中国和平统一促进会。我们愿与海内外各界人士，不分信仰、党派，不分宗教、民族，大家坦诚相见，就统一问题进行接触和会谈，共同探索中国和平统一的途径，以促进这一神圣使命的早日实现。他说，我们努力促进两岸人民之间的探亲、旅游、经贸、科技、教育、学术、文化、艺术、体育等各种交流广泛全面地开展，以增进共同的认识。程思远对祖国和平统一的前途充满希望。他说，让我们同海内外各界人士联合起来，集中华民族之大智慧，共建繁荣、富强、和平、民主、统一的中国。
    全国政协常委、全国政协祖国统一联谊委员会副主任万国权在发言中说，近年来海峡两岸各种民间贸易往来已经有了相当的发展。现在，大陆和台湾都在谋求经济发展的时候，台湾当局为什么不能抛弃偏见，开放直接通商呢？海峡两岸应当取长补短，互助互利，促进大陆和台湾的经济发展，为祖国的统一、富强作贡献。他希望海峡两岸的各党派、团体和工商界人士共同推进和平统一的进程，并能看到愈来愈多的台湾企业家到大陆经商和投资办厂。
    全国政协常委、老体育工作者钟师统说，《告台湾同胞书》是一篇具有巨大民族感召力的文告。在这篇文告的推动下，海峡两岸体育关系的发展也在这１０年中得到了很大进展。在世界性体育比赛中，两岸运动员情同手足，互相祝福，彼此声援，许多热烈场面令人难以忘怀。他说，大陆主张两岸体育往来不附加任何条件。大陆方面热情欢迎台湾体育工作者来大陆参观、访问，参加亚运会、全运会以及一切台湾同胞愿意参加的体育活动；大陆也随时愿意派运动员去台湾参加各种体育活动。我们希望台湾当局以奥林匹克精神和原则为准绳，拆除人为樊篱，允许两岸运动员、教练员和体育工作者自由往来，共同发展祖国体育事业。
    全国政协委员、著名京剧程派传人李世济说，自《告台湾同胞书》发表以来，两岸文化艺术交流便半公开地进行着。我们希望这种交流、往来公开化、直接化，希望台湾京剧工作者早日登上大陆舞台，而我们也能尽早地为台湾观众奉献我们的艺术果实，共同保护和发展京剧这个民族文化遗产。
    现年８５岁的全国政协常委黄维在讲话中说，我铭记着孙中山先生的教导：“‘统一’是中国全体人民的希望，能够统一，全国人民便享福，不能统一便要受害。”台湾当局现今小步开放，还不能适应世界趋向和平发展与改革的大潮流，更不适应炎黄子孙要求祖国统一的迫切心愿。台湾当局以“反共拒和”、“敌我意识”自我设限，为两岸关系的发展设置人为障碍，企图维持长期分离局面，这既有违国家民族利益，更不利于台湾的安定与发展。他说，海峡两岸应争取今天国内、国际有利条件，完成统一大计。他以黄埔军校第一期学生身份，希望台湾的黄埔同学争做“统一派”，促进祖国统一。
    全国政协委员李燕杰在会上即席赋诗一首，其中道“海峡难阻隔，元旦共相思。神州统一日，高歌祝酒时”。
    郭平坦、钱三强、张廉云、肖乾等先后在座谈会上发了言。
