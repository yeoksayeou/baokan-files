Tens of thousands of people were brutally persecuted by the so-called "three-person groups" in the 1930s and 1940s, as well as in the early 1950s. The CPSU Central Committee has proposed to revoke the judgments made by non-judicial organs and restore the honor of the victims.

According to a report by TASS today, the CPSU Central Committee's "Decision on Additional Measures to Rectify the Injustices Suffered by Those Persecuted in the 1930s and 1940s, as well as in the Early 1950s" states that "tens of thousands of Soviet citizens" were brutally persecuted by non-judicial organs such as the so-called "three-person groups."

The "three-person groups" refer to the anti-terrorist leadership organs established in 1934 in various regions of the Soviet Union, consisting of the heads of regional security organs, regional party secretaries, and regional prosecutors. These groups had the authority to decide on arrests and sentences, and their judgments were final, with no possibility of appeal and immediate execution.

The "Decision" states that the CPSU Central Committee proposes that the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet pass a legislative document to revoke the judgments made by the "three-person groups" and to exonerate the victims.

　　五十年代前数十万人惨遭“三人小组”迫害
    苏共中央建议撤销非司法机关的判决
    新华社莫斯科１月５日电  苏共中央建议撤销３０—４０年代以及５０年代初由非司法机关作出的判决，并为受害者恢复名誉。
    据塔斯社今天报道，苏共中央通过的《关于为３０—４０年代以及５０年代初受迫害者伸张正义的补充措施的决定》说，“有数十万苏联人”惨遭所谓“三人小组”等非司法机关的迫害。
    所谓“三人小组”是指１９３４年在苏联各州成立的由州安全机关领导人、州委书记和州检察长组成的反恐怖领导机关，它有权决定逮捕和判刑，而且判决不得上诉，立即执行。
    《决定》说，苏共中央建议最高苏维埃主席团通过立法文件，撤销“三人小组”作出的判决，为受害者平反。
