The People's Daily reports: Correspondent Yan Shigu reports: Jiangsu's Sihong County has taken decisive measures to stabilize grain production, ending a 30-year history of relying on state-subsidized grain, and has become one of the national commercial grain base counties. In recent years, it has provided the state with 830,000 tons of commercial grain, equivalent to 29 times the total amount of grain sold to the state in the 29 years before the Third Plenum.

Sihong County is located on the western shore of Hongze Lake, with a large area of cultivated land and many wastelands. In recent years, some places have shown signs of neglecting grain production. The county party committee and government have educated farmers to recognize the importance of grain production from a macro and long-term perspective; and strengthened land management, strictly controlling non-production use of cultivated land, keeping the area of good farmland stable at around 150,000 mu. At the same time, they actively encouraged farmers to reclaim wastelands for grain, with the policy that whoever develops the land benefits from it, and agricultural tax is exempted for three years. The 3,400 mu of wasteland in Chenggang Township has been gradually reclaimed into good farmland. Chengtou Forest Farm has turned 8,200 mu of wasteland into a grain storage. Shi Ji Township farmer Wu Shiyu, with a family of eight, reclaimed 117 mu of land in 1982, producing over 40,000 kg of grain for five consecutive years, providing the state with over 150,000 kg of commercial grain. His deeds were recorded in the "China Agricultural Yearbook." According to statistics, in recent years, this county has expanded its farmland by 70,000 mu.

In leading farmers to carry out development-oriented agricultural production, county leaders have focused on improving production conditions and enhancing agricultural capabilities. In recent years, they have invested 32.5 million yuan in water conservancy supporting projects; and invested over 8 million yuan in the construction of two major systems: agricultural technology promotion and seed breeding.

　　民以地为宝　农以粮为本
    泗洪县重视开发性生产
    本报讯  记者颜世贵报道：江苏泗洪县采取坚决措施，稳定粮食生产，结束了３０年吃国家统销粮的历史，成为全国商品粮基地县之一。几年来，向国家提供商品粮８３万多吨，相当于三中全会前２９年向国家售粮总数的２９倍。
    泗洪县地处洪泽湖西岸，耕地面积大，荒滩荒地多。前些年有的地方出现了忽视粮食生产的苗头。县委、县政府教育农民从大局、从长远利益认识种粮的重要性；并加强对土地的管理，严格控制非生产性占用耕地，全县良田面积始终稳定在１５０万亩左右。同时，积极鼓励农民向荒山滩涂要粮，谁开发谁得益，三年内免征农业税。重岗乡的３４００多亩荒山，经逐年开垦变成了良田。城头林场将８２００亩的滩涂荒地，营造成粮仓。石集乡农民吴士玉，一家８口人，１９８２年开荒造田１１７亩，连续５年产粮都在４万公斤以上，向国家提供商品粮１５万多公斤。他的事迹上了《中国农业年鉴》。据统计，几年来，这个县扩大农田面积７万亩。
    县领导在带领农民进行开发性农业生产中，注重改善生产条件，增强农业后劲。几年来，先后投资3２５０万元，用于修建水利配套工程；投资８００多万元，用于农业技术推广和良种繁育两大体系建设。
