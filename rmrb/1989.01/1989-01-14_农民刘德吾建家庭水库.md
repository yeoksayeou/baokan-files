    Farmer Liu Dewu of Luojiafang Village, Shenqiao Bridge Township, Xingan County, Jiangxi Province, has relied on his family's labor and raised 40,000 yuan to build a family reservoir with a capacity of 10,000 cubic meters.

    Liu Dewu's family of seven lives alone. Since 1983, they have contracted 28.51 mu of paddy fields in Niujiao Bay next to their house. Although the whole family has exerted all their efforts, due to a lack of water, the yield per mu is only about 200 jin. Last year, he invested heavily in water conservancy and achieved more than a doubling of yield per mu. After the autumn harvest and winter sowing, he invested all the money from selling grain into building the family reservoir, blasting stones, buying cement, purchasing culverts, and leading the family to work from dawn to dusk carrying soil and building dikes. After more than three months of hard work, a reservoir with a dam 53 meters long was finally built.

    According to calculations by technical personnel from the county's water and electricity bureau: Liu Dewu's family carried 3,000 cubic meters of soil; if invested by the state, it would cost 200,000 yuan; the reservoir can irrigate 50 mu of farmland and can also be used for fish farming and lotus planting.

    Some people call Liu Dewu the "New Qu Yuan of the 1980s."

　　农民刘德吾建家庭水库
    本报讯  江西省新干县神政桥乡罗家坊村农民刘德吾，依靠全家劳力，自筹资金４０００多元，建成一座蓄水量达１万立方米的家庭水库。
    刘德吾一家７口，单门独户，１９８３年起承包屋旁牛角湾２８．５１亩水田，虽然全家人使出全身本领，因为缺水，亩产只有２００来公斤。去年他舍得投入，在水利上做了点文章，结果每亩增产１倍多。秋收冬种后，他把卖粮的钱全部投在建家庭水库上，炸石块，买水泥，购涵管，带领全家劳力起早摸黑挑土筑堤。经过３个多月的辛劳，终于建成一座坝长５３米的水库。
    据县水电局技术人员测算：刘德吾一家共挑了土方３０００立方；如按国家投资，需花２万元；水库建成可灌溉农田５０亩，还可以养鱼、植莲等。
    有人称刘德吾是“８０年代新愚公”。
