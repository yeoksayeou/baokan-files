The Soviet State Statistics Committee released a report on January 21 detailing the execution of the 1988 national socio-economic development plan. The report indicates that the Soviet economy made some progress last year, but important economic indicators such as national income did not meet the plan, and state expenditures continued to exceed income, with the fiscal situation showing no fundamental improvement.

The report states that the Soviet Union's national income for 1988 was 625 billion rubles, an increase of 4.4% over the previous year, but this fell short of the planned 6.6% growth.

The industrial production situation in the Soviet Union last year was good, with a total output value of 903 billion rubles, a 3.9% increase over the previous year, just meeting the plan. The production of electricity, steel, coal, and natural gas all exceeded the plan. To accelerate the technological transformation of industrial enterprises, the state allocated a special fund of 45 billion rubles.

The report points out that the production of consumer goods last year was not ideal. The planned production quantities for radios, tape recorders, washing machines, vacuum cleaners, cars, and motorcycles were not met.

Agriculture is a key component of the Soviet national economy. Last year, state investments in developing agricultural-industrial complexes reached 65 billion rubles. However, the total agricultural output value only increased by 0.7% (1.6 billion rubles) over the previous year. Grain production was 195 million tons, a shortfall of 38 million tons. Potatoes, vegetables, and fruits also had varying degrees of reduced yields. Cotton production increased by 200,000 tons, meeting the state procurement plan. Meat and eggs each increased by 2%, and milk production increased by 3%.

The report states that the growth rate of the Soviet residents' monetary income in 1988 exceeded the total of the previous two years.

　　苏联去年经济取得一定进展   
    收入增加　工业不错　粮食歉收　消费品短缺
    新华社莫斯科１月２１日电  苏联国家统计委员会２１日公布了１９８８年国家社会经济发展计划执行情况的公报。公报表明，苏联经济去年取得一定进展，但是国民收入等重要经济指标未完成计划，国家的支出继续大于收入，财政状况没有根本好转。
    公报说，苏联１９８８年的国民收入为６２５０亿卢布，比上一年增长４．４％，但未完成增长６．６％的计划。
    去年苏联工业生产形势不错，总产值达９０３０亿卢布，比上一年增长３．９％，刚好完成计划。电力、钢材、煤炭、天然气的产量均超过计划。为加速工业企业的技术改造，国家拨出专款４５０亿卢布。
    公报指出，去年苏联消费品生产不够理想。收音机、录音机、洗衣机、吸尘器、小轿车、摩托车均未达到计划产量。
    农业是苏联国民经济中的重点，去年用于发展农工综合体的国家投资达６５０亿卢布。然而，农业总产值仅比上一年增长０．７％（１６亿卢布），谷物产量为１．９５亿吨，歉收３８００万吨。土豆、蔬菜、水果也都有不同程度歉产。皮棉增产２０万吨，完成了国家收购计划。肉、蛋分别增产２％，奶增产３％。
    公报说，苏联居民１９８８年的货币收入增长率超过了前两年的总和。
