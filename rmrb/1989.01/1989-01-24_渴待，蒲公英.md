	You are a small umbrella lost and sought for so long, you are a joyful spirit who does not know what to pursue and thus does not know pain.
	You can certainly be proud of your leisurely drifting with the wind. When the autumn breeze gently lifts you, you can travel the earth lightly, dreamingly, and lyrically.
	You can certainly boast of your tenacious vitality. Even in barren deserts, even in narrow, cold, and desolate crevices, you will broadcast life and hope.
	You can also satisfy your selfless giving. Look, when a bunch of small umbrellas bloom on the green lawn, children will joyfully rush towards you.
	Undoubtedly, you are an ancient spirit full of sighs and praises, loved and cherished by all.
	But I must ask—
	What is your quest? Which harbor is the destination of your life's journey? When will you learn to choose your life and master your fate, and let the helm of your ideals guide you to sail towards the other shore?

	I long for you, and I long for myself.

　　渴待，蒲公英
    光明
    你是一柄丢失多久寻觅多久的小伞，你是一个不知道追求因而也不知道痛苦的快乐精灵。
    你当然可以骄傲你随风漂泊的惬意，当秋风轻轻地托起你，你便可以一路轻飏一路梦幻一路抒情去漫游大地。
    你当然可以炫耀你生命力的顽强，即使贫瘠的荒漠，即使狭冷寂寥的崖缝，你都会把生命播出希望。
    你当然还可以满足你捧上的无私奉献，你看，当一柄柄小伞盛开在绿茵茵的草坪，孩子们便忘情地欢呼雀跃般涌向你。
    不容置疑，你是一个载满咏叹载满赞誉令人怜爱令人迷恋的古老精灵。
    但是，我要问——
    你的求索是什么？哪个港湾是你生命之船航行的终点，待到何年何月待到何日何时，你才能学会选择生活自主命运，并让那理想之舵驾驭你乘风向彼岸世界飞抵？
    我渴待，渴待着你，也渴待着我自己。
