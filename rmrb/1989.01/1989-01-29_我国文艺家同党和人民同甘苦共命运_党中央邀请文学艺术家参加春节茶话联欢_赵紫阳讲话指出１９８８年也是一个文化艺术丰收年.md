Chinese artists share joys and sorrows with the Party and the people. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China invited literary and artistic figures to a Spring Festival tea party and get-together. Zhao Ziyang pointed out that 1988 was also a year of cultural and artistic harvest.

New China News Agency, Beijing, January 28th: Zhao Ziyang said that the year 1988 that has just passed was "also a year of cultural and artistic harvest." When he made these remarks to the literary and artistic figures of the capital, he also asked those present to convey his greetings and congratulations to "all the friends in the literary and artistic circles across the country who have done a lot of work to promote spiritual civilization and flourish socialist literature and art."

At the invitation of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, 150 literary and artistic figures from the capital gathered in Zhongnanhai today, just before the traditional festival, to chat with Party and state leaders Zhao Ziyang, Li Peng, Wan Li, Qiao Shi, Hu Qili, and Yao Yilin.

The four lanterns in the Xilou Conference Hall brought a touch of joy, and on each small round table, a vase of blooming narcissus and a cup of tea. Wang Meng, the Minister of Culture, acted as the host, introducing himself as a "novelist," and then starting with Ai Qing, who was sitting in a wheelchair, introduced the new and old generations of literary, dramatic, musical, dance, fine arts, film, television, storytelling, and acrobatic artists.

Zhao Ziyang spoke, saying that the realization of the Four Modernizations and the revitalization of China are the common goals of the Chinese people today. To achieve this goal, we must adhere to the Party's basic line; we must have a stable and united political environment; we must foster a spirit of patriotism and self-improvement among the people nationwide; and we must further improve the cultural quality of the entire nation. In all these aspects, literary and artistic workers have a lot to do. The Party and the people need literature and art to fully play an active role, to boost morale, to enhance the cohesion of the entire nation, and to contribute to the creation of a healthy, civilized, democratic, and harmonious social atmosphere. At the same time, literature and art should also meet the diverse spiritual needs of the people. In short, the realm of literature and art is vast. The historical mission and social responsibility of Chinese literary and artistic workers are arduous but also glorious.

Zhao Ziyang pointed out that in our country, artists share joys and sorrows with the Party and the people. The Party and the cause of socialism are successful, the people are happy, the country is prosperous, and artists will have a good life and achieve great success. Conversely, when the Party and the cause of socialism encounter setbacks, artists and literary and artistic undertakings will inevitably suffer setbacks. In our country, the cause of the Party is closely linked with the cause of artists.

Zhao Ziyang finally said that in the future, all levels of Party committees should further implement the policy of "two hands." One hand should promote the development of socialist commodity economy and the development of productive forces, and the other hand should focus on ideological and political work, promoting the construction of spiritual civilization. In ideological and political work, cultural work is an important aspect. The Central Committee requires that leading comrades at all levels continue to and further care about and value literary and artistic work, seriously implement the "Hundred Flowers" policy and the Party's various policies on literary and artistic work, pay attention to dialogue and heart-to-heart talks with artists, listen to the opinions and demands of artists, and actively help literary and artistic workers solve various practical difficulties.

Today, performing artists who have won honors at home and abroad showed their prowess on the red carpet. At 74 years old, Yuan Shihai's Beijing opera aria, the 19-year-old violinist Lü Sicong's solo performance, which won an award in Italy, the folk dance "Spring River and Moon Night" by the veteran dancer Chen Ailian, and the ballet performance "Mulan Returns" by two young stars, seemed like a small snapshot: today's garden of a hundred flowers can accommodate various colors, and a vigorous generation is emerging on the stages of China and the world. Three years ago, Ji Xiaojin, who settled in Hong Kong, was troubled by the decline of her career in a comfortable living environment and returned to her Central Opera House. Today, she sang the song "I Love You, China."

    党中央邀请文学艺术家参加春节茶话联欢   
    赵紫阳讲话指出１９８８年也是一个文化艺术丰收年
    新华社北京１月２８日电  赵紫阳称刚刚过去的１９８８年，“也是一个文化艺术丰收年”。他对首都文学艺术家发表这番讲话时，还请在座者向“为促进精神文明与繁荣社会主义文艺做了大量工作的”全国文艺界朋友转达他的问候和祝贺。
    应中共中央邀请，首都的１５０名文学艺术家今天走进中南海，在传统节日前夕，与党和国家领导人赵紫阳、李鹏、万里、乔石、胡启立、姚依林等叙旧迎新。
    西楼会议厅里的四盏宫灯带来几分喜气，每张小圆桌上，一盆迎春的水仙加上一杯杯清茶。文化部部长王蒙以主持人身份，自称是个“写小说的”，而后从坐在轮椅上的艾青说起，代表文学、戏剧、音舞、美术、电影、电视、曲艺、杂技新老几辈的文艺家依次作了介绍。
    赵紫阳发表讲话说，实现四化、振兴中华，是当代中国人民的共同奋斗目标。为了实现这个目标，我们必须坚持党的基本路线；必须有一个安定团结的政治环境；必须在全国人民当中树立爱国主义和发奋图强的精神；必须进一步提高全民族的文明素质。在所有这些方面，文艺工作者都是大有可为的。党和人民需要文艺充分发挥积极作用，振奋民心民气，增强全国全民族的凝聚力，为创造健康、文明、民主、和谐的社会风尚作出自己的贡献。同时，文艺还要满足人民群众的多方面的精神需要。总之，文艺的天地是宽广的。我国文艺工作者的历史使命和社会责任很艰巨，也很光荣。
    赵紫阳指出，在我国，文艺家同党和人民是同甘苦、共命运的。党和社会主义的事业顺利，人民高兴，国家兴旺发达，文艺家的日子也就好过，成就也就丰硕。反之，党和社会主义的事业遇到挫折时，文艺家和文艺事业也必然受挫折。在我国，党的事业与文艺家的事业是紧密联系在一起的。
    赵紫阳最后说，今后各级党委要进一步贯彻两手抓的方针。一手抓发展社会主义商品经济，促进生产力的发展，一手抓思想和政治领域的工作，搞好精神文明建设。在思想政治领域的工作中，文化工作是一个重要的方面。中央要求各级领导同志继续和进一步关心、重视文艺工作，认真贯彻“双百”方针和党对文艺工作的各项政策，注意与文艺家们对话、谈心，听取文艺家们的意见、要求，积极帮助文艺工作者解决各种实际困难。
    在国内外获得殊荣的表演艺术家今天在红地毯上显得身手不凡。７４岁的袁世海一段京剧清唱，在意大利获奖的１９岁小提琴手吕思清的独奏，前辈舞蹈家陈爱莲的民族舞蹈《春江花月夜》和两位新秀的芭蕾舞表演《木兰归》，似乎一幅小小的缩影：如今的百花苑里，能容纳多种色彩，而富有朝气的一代正出现在中国和世界的舞台。三年前定居香港的季小琴，在优裕的生活环境中苦恼于事业的衰退，重又回到她所在的中央歌剧院，今天她演唱的歌曲是《我爱你，中国》。
