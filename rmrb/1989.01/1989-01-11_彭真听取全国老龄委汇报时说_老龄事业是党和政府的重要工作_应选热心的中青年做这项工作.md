	Peng Zhen Listens to the National Committee on Aging Report and Says Aging Work is an Important Task for the Party and Government, and Middle-Aged and Young People Who Are Keen on the Work Should Be Selected for It

	According to a report by the *People's Daily*, the *Chinese Senior Citizen's Daily* reported: On the eve of the New Year, Comrade Peng Zhen listened to a work report from the responsible person of the National Committee on Aging and made important remarks. He said: Now, many elderly comrades have retired from their posts, and it is particularly necessary to have an organization to manage the affairs of the elderly. We should select some middle-aged and young comrades who are enthusiastic about aging work to do this work. The work for the elderly is one of the important tasks of the Party and the government. Doing this work well is very important and also very difficult.

	Comrade Peng Zhen is very concerned about the aging population in our country. He said that the number of elderly people is increasing rapidly, which shows the superiority of our socialist system and the improvement of people's material living standards. Although the price index has risen a bit at present, the living standards of the elderly have declined somewhat, but all these problems will be solved through reform and adjustment. He hopes that the Committee on Aging will take care of the material and spiritual life of the elderly, so that the elderly who have retired will have documents and materials to read. Relying on newspapers alone is not enough. Let them know more about the spirit of the Central Committee, which is very important. Please pay attention to this.

	Regarding the improvement of the living conditions of the elderly, Comrade Peng Zhen said that countries with a large elderly population have a heavy burden on the government. China should be better. But if we do not have economic development and improvement of productivity, China will also face difficulties in the future. We must improve people's lives on the basis of economic development. You should combine the needs of the elderly with objective conditions to ensure the real improvement of the living conditions of the elderly. Due to the implementation of the family planning policy, in the future, we will face the problem of a couple supporting and taking care of four elderly people, which is very difficult. From now on, you must strengthen the social security work for the elderly, learn from domestic and foreign experiences, and do a good job in the work for the elderly.

	Comrade Peng Zhen also said that the Committee on Aging should do more work on the issue of the elderly having something to do, help them find things to do, so that they can have a happy late life and pass on their experience to the next generation.

　　彭真听取全国老龄委汇报时说
    老龄事业是党和政府的重要工作 
    应选热心的中青年做这项工作
    本报讯  据《中华老年报》报道：新年前夕，彭真同志在听取全国老龄委负责人汇报工作时，发表了重要意见，他说：现在全国很多老同志从工作岗位上退下来了，特别需要有一个机构来管老年人的事，应该选一些热心老龄事业的中青年同志做老龄工作。老年人的工作是党和政府的重要工作之一，做好这项工作是很重要的，也是很不容易的。
    彭真同志对我国人口老龄化十分关心，他说，老年人口的数字上升很快，表明我国社会主义制度的优越，人民物质生活水平的提高。目前虽然物价指数上升大一点，老同志生活水平有所下降，但经过改革调整，都会得到解决。他希望老龄委把老年人的物质生活和精神生活抓好，使退下来的老同志有文件和材料看，光靠报纸是不够的，让他们多了解中央的精神，这点很重要，请你们注意。
    对于老年人的生活改善问题，彭真同志说，老年人多的国家，政府发愁，负担很大。中国要好一些。但我们如没有经济的发展和生产力的提高，今后中国也会吃不消的。要在经济发展的基础上改善人民的生活，你们要把老年人的需要和客观条件相结合，使老年人的生活得到切实保障。由于实行计划生育政策，今后将面临一对夫妇扶养照顾４个老人问题，这是很困难的。从现在起，你们一定要把老年人的社会保障工作抓一抓，吸取国内外经验，把老年工作做好。
    彭真同志还说，在老有所为问题上，老龄委员会应该多做些工作，帮助他们找事情做，使他们晚年精神愉快，把自己的经验传给下一代。
