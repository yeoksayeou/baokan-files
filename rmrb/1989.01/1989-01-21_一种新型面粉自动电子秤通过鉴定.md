A new type of automatic electronic flour scale, the MDCH871, jointly developed by the Beijing Yunsheng Mechanical Science and Technology Consulting Service Department and the Liaoning Denglata Mechanical Factory, has successfully passed inspection after being tested at the Beijing Third Flour Mill for half a year. The scale demonstrated stable performance and reliable accuracy, addressing the long-standing issue of losses due to inaccurate weighing instruments in the grain processing industry.

The inspection, led by the Liaoning Provincial Science and Technology Commission, concluded that the product's performance is comparable to similar foreign products and has significant promotional value.
