Yang Shangkun Meets with Brazilian Parliamentary Delegation

New China News Agency, Beijing, January 11 — (Reporter Jiang Lurong) State Chairman Yang Shangkun met with a Brazilian parliamentary delegation led by Congress President and Senate President Humberto Lucena today in Beijing. Yang said that China hopes to see the emergence of a Latin American century.

Yang made this remark while discussing the current theory that the 21st century will be the Pacific century. He said that for the Pacific century or a Latin American century to truly materialize, countries like China, Brazil, and other third-world nations must develop.

He believes that development is not just about a country's own efforts but also requires cooperation among nations to establish a new international economic and political order. This is very important.

Yang said that both China and Brazil are vast countries with abundant resources. Both countries are currently facing the task of developing their economies and improving the lives of their people. The two countries should strengthen exchanges in various fields, share experiences, exchange views, learn from each other, and develop together. In this regard, the parliament is an important channel.

He believes that in recent years, the friendly relations between China and Brazil have developed well. Leaders of the two countries' governments and parliaments have had frequent exchanges. There is still much to be done in developing cooperation in the political, economic, and cultural fields between the two countries, and the prospects are broad.

Lucena said that this visit has left him and other members of the delegation with a very good impression of China. They have learned about China's political and economic situation as well as its introduction of foreign capital from discussions with the National People's Congress. This is beneficial.

He appreciated China's proposal to establish a new international economic order and hoped that the two countries would continue to strengthen exchanges and enhance mutual understanding between their peoples.

At the end of the meeting, Chairman Yang Shangkun asked Lucena to convey his cordial greetings to Brazilian President Jose Sarney. President Sarney had visited China in July of the previous year. Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Ni Zhifu and others attended the meeting.

　　杨尚昆会见巴西议会代表团
    新华社北京１月１１日电  （记者姜鲁榕）国家主席杨尚昆今天在这里会见由国会主席兼参议长温伯托·卢塞纳率领的巴西议会代表团时说，中国希望能够出现一个拉丁美洲世纪。
    杨尚昆是在谈到现在世界上关于２１世纪将是太平洋世纪的理论时这样说的。他说，要真正实现太平洋世纪或是拉丁美洲世纪，中国、巴西还有其它第三世界国家就要发展。
    他认为，发展不只是靠本国的力量，还需要国与国之间的合作，真正建立国际经济和政治新秩序。这一点是很重要的。
    杨尚昆说，中国、巴西都是幅员广大的国家，资源丰富。两国现在又都面临着发展经济，改善人民生活的任务。中巴两国应加强在各个领域的交往，彼此介绍经验，交换意见，取长补短，共同发展。在这方面，议会是一个重要的渠道。
    他认为，近年来，中巴两国间的友好关系发展是好的。两国政府、议会领导人进行了频繁往来。两国在发展政治、经济、文化等领域的合作关系方面，还有许多事情要做，前景是广阔的。
    卢塞纳说，这次访问使他和代表团其他成员对中国留下很好的印象。他们从同中国人大的会谈中了解了中国政治、经济以及引进外资的情况。这是有益的。
    他赞赏中国提出的关于建立国际经济新秩序的建议，并希望两国不断加强交流，增进两国人民间的相互了解。
    会见结束时，杨尚昆主席请卢塞纳转达他对巴西总统若泽·萨尔内的亲切问候。萨尔内总统曾于去年７月访问过中国。全国人大常委会副委员长倪志福等参加了会见。
