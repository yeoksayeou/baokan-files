Marxism has never acknowledged the existence of any abstract moral principles that are independent of material living conditions. Moral principles ultimately derive from real economic relationships. Of course, since social development is a continuous process across generations, the moral principles recognized by a group in each era contain both historical deposits and future aspirations, both the extension of cultural traditions from their own nation and region, and the influence of cultural fusion from various nations and regions. Therefore, they contain extremely complex content and manifest in a myriad of forms. However, the demand for developing productive forces, and the real economic relationships determined by this demand, remain the deepest and most persistent forces shaping moral principles. All other factors, sooner or later, must undergo screening, filtering, refraction, or reorganization through real economic relationships, and be forged into a whole that adapts to real economic relationships. This whole cannot exceed the range allowed by real economic relationships. Under the impetus of the demand for developing productive forces, economic relationships change, and they will inevitably, with great force and a stable tendency, compel moral principles to change according to their requirements (which are essentially the requirements of developing productive forces). The influence of moral principles on economic relationships is undoubtedly enormous, but they are ultimately derived and secondary. In the end, it is not the requirements of developing productive forces that should conform to some moral principle, but rather all moral principles, sooner or later, must adapt to the requirements of developing productive forces. This is a rule that human history has repeatedly confirmed.

    生产力标准与道德原则
    马克思主义从来不承认有什么不依赖于物质生活条件的、先天的、抽象的道德原则。道德原则归根到底是从现实的经济关系中汲取得来的。当然，由于社会发展是世代绵延的过程，因而在每一时代的群体公认的道德原则中，都既有历史的积淀，又有未来的憧憬，既有本民族本地区文化传统的延伸，又有各民族各地区文化交融的影响，因而包含着极其复杂的内容，表现为千差万别的形式。但是，发展生产力的要求，以及由此决定的现实的经济关系，仍然是最深层的、最顽强的左右道德原则的力量、一切其他因素或迟或早都不免要经过现实经济关系的筛选、过滤、折光或重组，被熔铸为适应现实经济关系的整体，这个整体是不能超过现实经济关系所能允许的范围的。在生产力发展需要的推动下，经济关系变化了，它就必然会以强大的力量、稳定的倾向迫使道德原则按照它的要求（实质上就是发展生产力的要求）发生变化。道德原则对经济关系的作用无疑是巨大的，但它毕竟是派生的、第二性的东西。说到底，不是发展生产力的要求应该服从某种道德原则，而是一切道德原则或迟或早都不得不适应生产力发展的要求。这是人类的历史反复证实了的规律。
