Lebanese Christian and Muslim leaders will begin peace talks on January 30 under the auspices of the Arab Committee for the Resolution of the Lebanese Crisis.

The Arab mediation committee held a secret meeting in Tunis on January 29 before the peace talks began.

Lebanese Muslim leader Hussein and Acting Prime Minister Hus have arrived in Tunis, while Christian leader and interim military government Prime Minister Aoun has left Beirut and is expected to arrive in Tunis soon.

Sabah, the head of the mediation committee and Kuwait's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, met with Hussein and Hus and told reporters that the meeting gave him hope that the committee's efforts to resolve the Lebanese crisis would be successful. However, he emphasized that the resolution of the crisis still depends on the reconciliation attitude of the Lebanese leaders from both factions.

Sabah said he would also hold talks with Aoun upon his arrival in Tunis.

The Arab mediation committee was established earlier this month by the Arab League to resolve the Lebanese crisis. Its members include Kuwait, Jordan, Tunisia, Algeria, the United Arab Emirates, and the Secretary-General of the Arab League.

Midway through this month, the committee invited Hus and Aoun to Tunis for peace talks. Both sides expressed their willingness to cooperate with the committee and participate in the peace talks in Tunis.

In September of last year, the term of the former president expired. Due to serious disagreements between the Muslim and Christian factions over the selection of a new president, Lebanon found itself in a situation where there was no president, but two governments existed simultaneously, led by Aoun and Hus, respectively.

　　谋求解决黎巴嫩危机    
    黎两派领导人将举行和谈
    新华社贝鲁特１月２９日电  据贝鲁特电台广播，黎巴嫩基督教和穆斯林两派领导人将于３０日在阿拉伯解决黎巴嫩危机调解委员会的主持下开始举行和解会谈。
    阿拉伯调解委员会２９日在和解会谈举行之前在突尼斯举行了秘密会议。
    黎巴嫩穆斯林领导人侯赛尼和代总理胡斯已抵达突尼斯，基督教领导人、临时军政府总理奥恩也已离开贝鲁特，预计很快将抵达突尼斯。
    调解委员会负责人、科威特副首相兼外交大臣萨巴赫在会晤了侯赛尼和胡斯后对记者说，会晤使人感到调解委员会为解决黎巴嫩危机所作的努力有成功的希望。但他强调说，危机的解决还取决于黎巴嫩两派领导人的和解态度。
    萨巴赫说，他还将在奥恩抵达突尼斯后同他举行会谈。
    阿拉伯调解委员会是阿拉伯联盟为解决黎巴嫩危机于本月早些时候成立的，成员包括科威特、约旦、突尼斯、阿尔及利亚、阿拉伯联合酋长国和阿盟秘书长。
    本月中旬，该委员会邀请胡斯和奥恩到突尼斯参加和解会谈。双方都表示愿意同该委员会合作，前往突尼斯参加和解会谈。
    去年９月，前总统任期届满。由于穆斯林和基督教两大派在新总统人选问题上存在严重分歧，黎巴嫩形成了没有总统，却有以奥恩为首和胡斯为首的两个政府并存的局面。
