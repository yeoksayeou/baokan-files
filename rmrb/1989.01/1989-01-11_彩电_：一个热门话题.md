The market is always a window that people are concerned about. To help readers further observe the market and understand various phenomena in the reform process, in the new year, we have opened the "Market Horizons" column for readers.

The market is a vast field, including not only consumer goods and production materials markets, but also capital, labor, technology, information, and real estate markets. Market fluctuations comprehensively reflect reform and development, production and consumption, people's joys and sorrows. "Market Horizons" will start from a type of commodity, an incident, a phenomenon, or a hot topic, and delve into consumption policies, industrial policies, distribution policies, price policies, as well as people's various ideas and mindsets during the transition period between old and new systems. The goal is to help readers correctly understand the changing market, understand the reform, and adjust their consumption behavior. We sincerely hope that readers will actively contribute articles and offer suggestions for improvement, and support this column.

At the end of the Year of the Dragon, good news frequently emerged from China's color television (color TV) production: China has become a major color TV producer in the world, with annual production exceeding 9 million units.

However, amidst this wave of good news, consumers saw a different scene: in major cities' state-owned stores, color TVs were rarely available. Those that were available were either priced exorbitantly—an 18-inch color TV sold for over 3,000 yuan—or bundled with obsolete products. In many places, buying one color TV meant receiving multiple times the price of the TV in related equipment; a consumer in Chongqing, when buying a color TV, was bundled with 120 shoe brushes priced at 17 yuan each.

Circulation chaos, prices all over the place

Domestically produced color TVs that state-owned businesses can obtain are less than 30%. Apart from manufacturers retaining some for foreign exchange, a significant portion of color TVs are divided up by "connections" and "notes."

The hundreds of millions of color TVs divided up are mostly resold at high prices by "companies," "centers," and individuals. From January to July 1988, the industrial and commercial administration of Zhejiang Province handled over 40 major cases of illegal color TV trading, seizing over 3,500 color TVs, an increase of 255% compared to the same period last year.

In May 1988, the State Price Bureau, the Ministry of Machinery and Electronics, and the Ministry of Commerce jointly issued a document regulating the price of 18-inch color TVs from 1,300 yuan to around 1,800 yuan. However, this state-regulated price became a mere formality as soon as it was issued. In many cities, state-owned stores had prices but no goods, while the black market saw color TV prices soaring. From July to early October 1988, Hainan Province imported over 60,000 color TVs, but the large-scale imports did not change the situation of state-owned stores having no color TVs. Instead, individual street shops were filled with various brand color TVs, but the prices were more than double the state-regulated price, reaching over 4,000 yuan.

To address this abnormal phenomenon in the color TV market, some places adopted the method of issuing certificates and tickets for regulation, while more places, to "ensure" the local market, took the initiative to implement a "price release" measure of "adding a markup based on the purchase price," making color TV prices even more chaotic.

Price release, public hard to bear

Releasing color TV prices has increased the strength of production enterprises, and the state has also collected more taxes. However, the reality cannot be doubted: releasing prices is like pouring oil on the fire of the "color TV craze." Now, many people regard buying a color TV as an investment. Currently, in cities without color TVs, a considerable portion belongs to households with lower living standards. They save up for years to buy a color TV, so they are very sensitive to the sharp rise in color TV prices.

In August 1988, at a savings branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank in a certain city in Northeast China, a public servant about to retire withdrew his savings of over 2,000 yuan and started crying before leaving the counter. The money he originally planned to buy a color TV for each of his two children could no longer buy one, even with interest. It seems that low-income consumers really cannot afford high-priced color TVs.

Moreover, the price of color TVs in China is already higher than international prices. After releasing prices, the significant domestic and international price gap allows speculators to make huge profits from reselling, thereby stimulating even more rampant color TV smuggling activities. A smuggler who was caught boasted: "Ten smuggling attempts, as long as two succeed, you become a millionaire."

Many economists are also concerned: a significant price increase will inevitably affect the export of domestically produced color TVs, reducing their competitiveness in the international market. The high price and high profit of color TV production are not conducive to enterprises improving their scientific and technological and management levels.

Concentrated operation, a feasible approach

On one hand, color TV prices should not be released; on the other hand, the chaotic circulation of color TVs needs to be rectified. It seems that the way to resolve this contradiction is to take the path of "concentrated operation."

Relevant personnel have done some calculations.

Two years ago, the ownership of color TVs per 100 urban households in China reached 43.66 units, an increase of over 59% compared to 1986. Currently, China has 113 color TV production lines with an assembly capacity of 16 million units. To improve the matching capacity of color TVs, the state is building 3 large-scale color picture tube factories. Adding the existing color tube production capacity, it is estimated that by 1990, nearly 10 million color picture tubes can be provided annually.

It can be seen that although the supply and demand situation of color TVs will not change significantly in the next two years, by 1990, the "color TV craze" may cool down. During the current one or two years of "tight" period, implementing concentrated operation of color TVs is not a bad transitional measure.

However, some people are also concerned. The reason is that China's current color picture tube factories still rely on imported raw materials. In a situation where the state's foreign exchange is not abundant, it is difficult to guarantee the foreign exchange needed for color TV production. Therefore, "transition" is not a matter of two or three years. In a situation of "too many monks and too little porridge," concentrated operation may form a monopoly, and units that control the operation rights of color TVs are bound to have problems such as issuing tickets and backdoor deals. Moreover, state-owned businesses operating color TVs will also have to spend a lot of manpower and resources on registration, ticket issuance, and supervision and management.

Different people have different views. It seems that implementing concentrated operation of color TVs is not easy. The coordination of relevant policies and measures is probably an important condition for the effectiveness of concentrated operation.

　　“彩电”：一个热门话题
    本报记者  潘岗
    编者按：市场始终是人们关心的一个“窗口”。为了帮助读者进一步观察市场，了解改革中的种种现象，在新的一年里，我们为读者开辟了《市场纵横》专栏。
    市场是个广阔的领域，不仅包括消费品和生产资料市场，而且包括资金、劳务、技术、信息和房地产等市场。市场的变幻，综合反映了改革和发展，生产和消费，人们的喜和忧。《市场纵横》将从一类商品、一次风波、一种现象、一个热门话题生发开去，透视消费政策、产业政策、分配政策、价格政策，以及新旧体制交替时期的人们种种观念和心态，目的是帮助读者正确认识变化中的市场，理解改革，调整自己的消费行为。我们热诚地希望广大读者踊跃来稿和提出改进意见，关心和支持这个专栏。
    龙年岁尾，我国彩色电视机生产频频传出喜讯：中国成为世界彩电生产大国，全年产量突破９００万台。
    然而，就在这一片报喜的喝采声中，消费者却看到了另一番景象：在各大城市的国营商店，很少有彩电出售。个别有的，不是价高得出奇——一台１８英寸彩电卖３０００元以上，就是和滞销品“配套销售”。许多地方售一台彩电，搭售数倍于彩电价格的放相设备；重庆一消费者买台彩电，竟被搭售了１２０只单价１７元的鞋刷子。
    　　　　流通混乱，价格五花八门
    国产彩电，国营商业能拿到手的不足３０％。除了生产厂家自留一些用于筹集外汇，有相当大一部分彩电被“关系”、“条子”瓜分了。
    被瓜分的数百万台彩电，绝大部分经“公司”、“中心”和个人倒手，高价甩到了市场上。１９８８年１—７月，浙江省工商管理机关就查处非法经营、倒卖彩电大案４０多起，查获彩电３５００多台，比上年同期增长２５５％。
    １９８８年５月，国家物价局、机电部、商业部联合发文，规定１８英寸彩电单价由１３００元调到１８００元左右。可是，这一国家牌价，自它出台之日起就成为一纸空文。许多城市，国营商店有价无货，黑市上彩电“水涨船高”。海南省１９８８年７月到１０月初进口彩电逾６万台，但大量进口，并未改变国营商场彩电无货的现状，相反，沿街个体商店中各种名牌彩电随处可见，只是价格高出国家牌价一倍以上，单价达４０００多元。
    对于彩电市场这种不正常现象，有的地方采取了发证发票的办法去治理，而更多的地方为了“保证”本地市场，纷纷自作主张，对彩电实行了按“进价顺加定价”的“放开”措施，使得彩电价格更加五花八门。
    　　　　放开价格，群众难以承受
    放开彩电价格，生产企业得以增加了实力，国家也因此多收了税。但现实情况不容人们怀疑：放开价格，无异于在“彩电热”的炉膛中浇了一瓢油。如今不少人已把买彩电当作置家产看待。现在城市中尚无彩电者，相当部分属于生活水平偏低的人家。他们为买彩电，日积月累，所以，对彩电价格猛涨十分敏感。
    １９８８年８月，东北某市工商银行储蓄所。一即将退休的公职人员取出积蓄多年的２０００多元钱，没离开柜台就落下眼泪，原打算给两个孩子每人买一台彩电的钱，不想现在加上利息也买不到一台了。看来，低收入消费者对于高价彩电实在难以承受。
    另外，我国彩电价格本来就比国际价格高出一截，放开价格后，悬殊的国内外差价使倒爷转手可获巨额利润，由此刺激了更加猖獗的彩电走私活动。一位被查处的走私分子扬言：１０次走私，只要两次成功，也就成了几万元户。
    许多经济界人士亦担心：大幅度提价，势必影响国产彩电出口，降低在国际市场上的竞争力，彩电生产厂价高利厚，不利于企业提高科学技术与管理水平。
    　　　　集中经营，一种可行的办法
    一方面，彩电价格不宜放开，另一方面又要治理彩电流通中的混乱现象，看来，解决这一矛盾的方式，只有走“集中经营”之路。
    有关人士算了一笔账。
    前年，我国每百户城镇居民彩色电视机占有量已达４３．６６台，较１９８６年增长５９％以上。目前，我国有彩电生产线１１３条，组装能力达１６００万台。为了提高彩电配套能力，国家正在建设的大型彩色显像管厂就有３个，加上现有的彩管生产能力，预计到１９９０年，每年可提供彩色显像管近千万只。
    可见，彩电供求紧张状况，虽然近两年内不会有大的变化，但到１９９０年以后，“彩电热”就有可能“降温”。在目前一、两年的“紧张”期间，对彩电实行集中经营，不失为一种可行的过渡办法。
    但另一些人士却不乏担心。依据是，我国目前的彩色显像管厂，原材料仍依赖进口，在国家外汇并不富余的今天，要保证彩电生产用汇很困难。所以，“过渡”决不是两、三年的问题。在“僧多粥少”的情况下，集中经营可能会形成垄断，掌握彩电经营权的单位难免出现批条子、走后门等等弊端，另外，经营彩电的国营商业还要出许多人力、物力登记发票，监督管理。
    仁者见仁，智者见智。看起来，彩电实行集中经营也非易事。有关政策、措施的配套，恐怕是集中经营能否见效的重要条件。
