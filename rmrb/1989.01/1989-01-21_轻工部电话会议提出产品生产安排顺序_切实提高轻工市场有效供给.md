The Ministry of Light Industry held a teleconference for bureau and department heads today, proposing a sequence for product production. The conference required that all localities implement the spirit of the State Council's leadership to ensure effective supply in the light industry market and to specifically implement these measures.

Minister of Light Industry Zēng Xiānlín said at the teleconference that the sequence for product production is to ensure the production of necessities for people's lives, actively organize the production of high foreign exchange-earning products, and, within capacity, produce high-circulation consumer goods. He emphasized that local bureaus and departments should proactively seek support from local governments and relevant departments in terms of materials, funds, and foreign exchange. They should make great efforts to organize the supply of raw materials, help enterprises coordinate and solve production difficulties, and do everything possible to organize the production of light industrial products.

This year's light industry export earnings plan is expected to increase by 15% to 20% compared to last year. Among the high foreign exchange-earning "key" products, priority should be given to the export of refrigerators and beer. The export of refrigerators this year will mainly rely on enterprises and enterprise groups with self-operated export rights. Measures will be implemented to designate brands and points for export, and to form joint ventures for external operations. Beer will be led by well-known brands such as "Qingdao," forming enterprise groups to expand export volumes. Exported beer not only needs to ensure product quality but also improve packaging to facilitate consumption.

Salt and sugar are necessities for people's lives. The State Council has agreed to establish a salt industry development fund, aiming to develop the salt industry through the salt industry itself. The salt industry fund should be used for the development of salt production bases and not for technological transformation investments, nor should it be diverted for other uses. To ensure an increase in sugar production, after ensuring that the market's rationed part is sold through the Commercial Department, the remaining part will be sold industrially. A maximum price should be set to prevent reselling.

To ensure the production of famous and high-quality white spirits, in the future, taxes will be levied differently based on the alcohol content. Small distilleries will not be exempted from product taxes, value-added taxes, or income taxes. Except for famous and high-quality spirits at the provincial level and above, grain consumption should not be increased to boost white spirit production. The construction projects for white spirit production should be reviewed.

Zēng Xiānlín also required that all localities organize the production of festival products to prosper the Spring Festival market.

　　轻工部电话会议提出产品生产安排顺序    
    切实提高轻工市场有效供给
    本报北京１月２０日讯  记者刘桂莲报道：轻工业部今天召开厅局长电话会议，提出产品生产安排顺序，要求各地贯彻国务院领导关于确保轻工市场有效供给的精神，具体落实。
    轻工业部部长曾宪林在电话会议上说，产品生产安排的顺序是，确保人民生活必需品，积极组织生产高创汇产品，量力而行生产高回笼货币的消费品。他强调，各地厅局要主动争取地方政府和有关部门在物资、资金、外汇等方面的支持，下大力气组织好原材料供应，帮助企业协调和解决生产中的困难，千方百计组织好轻工产品的生产。
    今年轻工出口创汇计划比去年增长１５％—２０％。在高创汇的“拳头”产品中，首先要抓好电冰箱和啤酒的出口。电冰箱出口今年将以有自营出口权的企业和企业集团为主体，对出口厂实行定牌、定点，联合对外的新措施。啤酒将以“青岛”牌等名牌生产厂为龙头，组建企业集团，扩大出口量。出口的啤酒除要保证产品质量，还要改进包装，方便消费。
    食盐、食糖是人民生活必需品。国务院已同意设立盐业发展基金，走以盐养盐的发展道路。盐业基金要用于盐业生产的基地开发，不能用做技术改造投资，更不准挪做它用。为确保食糖增产，在确保市场民用定量部分交商业部销售后，其余部分实行工业自销。要确定最高限价，防止转手倒卖。
    为保证名优白酒的生产，今后要按酒的度数高低不同区别纳税标准，小酒厂一律不减免产品税、增值税、所得税。除省级以上名优酒外，不得增耗粮食增加白酒产量。要清理白酒生产的在建项目。
    曾宪林还要求各地组织好节日产品生产，繁荣春节市场。
