The story begins in early July 1987.

After completing his studies at the Tai'an Municipal Party School's enterprise management program, Chen Mingxue took over the management of the Xintai City Wool Textile Factory. He never imagined that he would inherit such a mess: the factory was in disarray, funds and raw materials were scarce, and their flagship product, knitting yarn, had gone from being a best-seller to being stuck in inventory. Chen Mingxue was deeply troubled. What to do? He stepped out and walked among the workers...

Ten days later, Chen Mingxue delivered his inaugural speech: "As the saying goes, 'When people's hearts are united, they can move mountains.' When people's hearts are not united, all they do is argue. As leaders, we must do things that are worthy of the workers' praise..."

Within two months, the factory had done several concrete things for the workers: they arranged rest areas for female workers on the night shift, restored the nursing room, and bought a large bus to transport workers' children to and from school... But that was not all. Chen Mingxue reflected: before taking over, workers felt they were working for the state. Now, why should they work for the contractor? The enterprise must be run by the workers. Only by eliminating the workers' sense of being hired and igniting their sense of ownership and energy, can the enterprise develop and thrive. Chen Mingxue thought deeply and boldly proposed the idea of democratic factory management.

Chen Mingxue said, democratic factory management means allowing employees to participate directly in the political life, production, and economic distribution of the enterprise. The core is to understand, respect, care for, and rely on the workers.

"Now our voices are heard"

Originally, the Xintai Wool Textile Factory had to take attendance three times a day. When attendance was taken, people were present, but as soon as attendance was over, they left. Chen Mingxue had deep feelings about this. He proposed that the factory's labor discipline and management policies should all be discussed by the workers. Workers should formulate their own rules based on the characteristics of their positions, and the factory's functional departments should inspect them. The factory's congress of workers and staff was also greatly strengthened. Previously, the congress of workers and staff was just a formality and could be done in half a day. Now, there are three days of preparatory meetings before the congress, allowing workers to fully participate in the discussion. Previously, when selecting representatives for the congress of workers and staff, the leadership decided who would be elected. Now, everyone votes, and the "right" word is the final say. Workers applauded: "Now our voices are heard."

Last March, raw material prices rose, and the entire factory would face an additional expenditure of over 500 ten thousand yuan, facing the danger of stopping production. Chen Mingxue laid out the facts to the entire factory. The workers said, "No problem, let's raise funds." In just over 20 days, they raised over 90 ten thousand yuan. One worker, who had over 30,000 yuan in debt due to a family member's illness, managed to borrow 5,000 yuan. He found the workshop director and said: "Although our family has difficulties, how can we watch the factory collapse? This is our home!" The workshop director was moved and said: "Democratic political life makes workers truly regard the factory as their own home. With the combined efforts of workers and the factory director, our enterprise has hope."

From "Making Me Work" to "I Want to Work"

No matter how skilled the contractor is, there are limits. Chen Mingxue gathered the wisdom of the workers and summarized the democratic production and management method.

To allow workers to participate directly in production and management, the Xintai Wool Textile Factory established factory and workshop democratic management committees. The factory management committee is composed of administrative, technical, party committee, trade union, and youth league leaders and worker representatives, with worker representatives making up 30%. The factory management committee discusses major issues such as factory management policies, long-term and annual plans, and wage adjustment plans, assisting the factory director in decision-making.

Since 1987, the price of raw materials has risen several times, seriously affecting the enterprise's benefits. The factory trade union cooperated to launch the "Contribute an Idea for the Factory" activity. Workers proposed over 80 cost-saving and revenue-increasing measures, of which 32 were adopted by the factory, increasing revenue by over 40 ten thousand yuan. Previously, the factory treated recycled yarn as waste. During the idea-contributing activity, workers proactively proposed that three people's work could be done by two, freeing up one person to sort and reuse recycled yarn. This alone increased revenue by 12 ten thousand yuan. Workers said, "Previously, it was 'make me work,' now it's 'I want to work.' Considering the factory as home, even if it's hard and tiring, we are willing."

From the Workshop Director Eating Watermelon to Wages on the Wall

In the Xintai Wool Textile Factory, each workshop has a blackboard on the wall with the workers' wages written on it. Chen Mingxue said that the democratic economic distribution method was inspired by the workers. Once, a few workers saw the workshop director sometimes eating watermelon in the office and always suspected that the director was using their money, so they went to Chen Mingxue to "report." At that time, only the workshop director knew how much money the workshop received from the factory each month.

Now, the factory regularly publishes information about the enterprise's profits, tax payments, and retained earnings distribution plans, and how much money each workshop receives from the factory and how it is distributed is all made public. Workers implement piecework wages, and the workshop democratic management committee directly participates in the distribution work. Workers generally feel that the transparency of the public notice is high, and those who earn more are proud, while those who earn less have no complaints.

The Guarantee of Democratic Work Methods

Chen Mingxue believes that only by institutionalizing and standardizing democratic management can the past practice of "the leader remembers to be democratic, the leader forgets to be undemocratic" be overcome, and whoever becomes the factory director must act according to the system.

In the Xintai Wool Textile Factory, the factory director must follow a strict procedure to make major decisions: the factory director hires a group of experts in various major cities across the country as information consultants, establishing economic information, technical information, and enterprise management information networks. The information from the three networks is sorted by the "Three Chief Offices" (Chief Engineer, Chief Accountant, Chief Economist Office) and proposes feasible plans, which are then submitted to the factory management committee for discussion and assistance in decision-making by the factory director. The factory congress of workers and staff plays a supervisory role.

Since the factory director and party committee secretary is the chairman of the factory management committee, and the trade union chairman and party committee deputy secretary is the vice-chairman of the factory management committee, the opinions of the party committee and trade union are both considered in the decision-making process, realizing the supervisory role of the party committee, the guarantee function, and the trade union's role of representing workers' interests. The party, government, and trade union relations are "naturally smooth." All organizational structures of the enterprise revolve around the factory director, with one mind and one effort.

In 1988, the Xintai Wool Textile Factory, despite facing nearly 700 ten thousand yuan in additional expenditures, achieved a profit and tax of 748 ten thousand yuan, an increase of 15.8% over 1987, and achieved a production value of 2,775 ten thousand yuan, an increase of 24.5% over 1987. The per capita labor productivity was 2.73 ten thousand yuan, an increase of 26% over 1987. They also won over 20 provincial and municipal awards. The entire factory of over 1,500 people had no one committing crimes, and 115 party members had no one committing disciplinary violations.

　　陈明学民主办厂
    本报记者  廖玒
    话从１９８７年７月初说起。
    陈明学从山东泰安地委党校企业管理大专班学成后，承包了新泰市毛纺织厂。他怎么也没想到接的是这样一副乱摊子：厂里人心涣散，资金原料奇缺，拳头产品棒针线由畅销变为滞销。陈明学心情沉重。怎么办？他迈开双脚走到群众中……
    １０天之后，陈明学发表就职演说：“俗话说，人心齐，泰山移，人心不齐光扯皮。我们当干部的，就要做那些值得工人称道的事……”
    两个月内厂里为工人办了几桩实实在在的好事：为上夜班的女工安排休息场所，恢复哺乳室，买了一辆大客车接送职工子女上下学……事情并非到此为止。陈明学在深思：承包前，工人觉得是为国家干，现在呢，凭什么给承包人干？企业要由工人当家做主。只有消除工人的被雇佣思想，激发他们主人翁的意识和能量，企业才能发展，才有活力。陈明学深思熟虑，大胆提出了民主办厂的设想。
    陈明学说，民主办厂就是让职工直接参与企业政治生活、生产经营、经济分配。核心是理解、尊重、关心、依靠工人。
    　　　　“现在俺们说话有人听了”
    新泰毛纺厂原先一天要点三次名，点名时人在，点完名走人，陈明学对此深有感触，他提出，工厂劳动纪律的制订以及办厂方针等大事，全部交给工人讨论，由工人结合岗位特点自己订规章，由厂职能部门检查。厂职代会也大大加强了，过去开职代会不过是走走形式，半天就够了。现在大会前有３天的预备会，让职工有充分的参议时间。过去选职代会代表，领导让谁当谁就当。现在大家投票选举，“正”字说了算。职工拍手称赞：“现在俺们说话有人听了。”
    去年３月，原料涨价，全厂将增支５００多万元，工厂面临停产危险。陈明学把实情向全厂摊了底。工人说，“没说的，集资”，２０多天里就集资９０多万元。有位工人因为家属有病欠了３０００多元的债，硬是东拼西凑借了５００元钱，他找到车间主任说：“虽然俺家有困难，但怎么能眼看着工厂倒了，这是俺的家啊！”车间主任动情地说：“政治生活民主使工人真正把工厂当成自己的家。有了工人和厂长两个积极性的叠加效应，我们的企业就有希望了。”
    　　　　从“要我干”到“我要干”
    手大难遮天。承包人的本事再大，也总有限。陈明学集中职工智慧，总结出生产经营民主法。
    为了让职工直接参与生产经营，新泰毛纺厂成立了厂及车间民主管理委员会。厂管委会由行政、技术、党委、工会、共青团负责人和职工代表组成，职工代表占３０％。厂管委会就厂经营方针、长远及年度计划、工资调整方案等重大问题进行商讨，协助厂长决策。
    １９８７年以来，原料价格成倍上涨，严重影响企业效益。厂工会配合开展了“我为工厂献一计”活动，职工先后提出８０多项增收节支措施，被厂里采用了３２项，一年可增收４０多万元。厂里以前都是把回丝当下脚料，在献计活动中，工人主动提出三人的工作可以两人干，挤出一人整理回丝搞再利用，仅此一项一年增收１２万元。工人们说，过去是“要我干”，现在是“我要干”。以厂为家，苦点累点也心甘情愿。
    　　　　从车间主任吃西瓜到工资上墙
    在新泰毛纺厂，每个车间墙上都有一块黑板，上面写着工人的工资数。陈明学说，经济分配民主法是受工人启发实行的。有一次，几个工人看车间主任有时在办公室吃西瓜，总怀疑主任用的是大伙的钱，就找陈明学“告状”，因为那时车间从工厂每月领了多少钱，只有车间主任知道。
    现在，工厂定期公布企业盈利、上交利税和自留金分配方案等情况，各车间从工厂领了多少钱、如何分配，也统统公布于众。工人实行计件工资，各车间民主管理委员会直接参与分配工作。工人们普遍表示，张榜公布透明度高，拿的多光荣，拿的少也没有怨言。
    　　　　民主工作法的保证
    陈明学认为，只有民主管理制度化、规范化，才能克服过去“领导想起来就民主，想不起来就不民主”的弊病，不管谁当厂长都得按制度办。
    在新泰毛纺厂，厂长做重大决策须经一套严密程序：厂长在全国各大城市聘请一批专家作信息员，建立了经济信息、技术信息、企业管理信息网络。三个网络的信息通过“三师办”（总工程师、总会计师、总经济师办公室）整理，提出可行性方案，交厂管委会，协助厂长决策。厂职代会起监督作用。
    由于厂长兼党委书记是厂管委会主任，工会主席兼党委副书记任厂管委会副主任，这样，在决策过程中就兼顾了党委和工会的意见，实现了党委的监督、保证作用和工会代表工人利益的职能，党、政、工关系“不理自顺”。企业的所有组织围绕厂长这个中心，心往一处想，劲往一处使。
    １９８８年，新泰毛纺厂在增支近７００万元的情况下，实现利税７４８万元，比１９８７年增长１５．８％，实现产值２７７５万元，比１９８７年增长２４．５％，全员劳动生产率２．７３万元，比１９８７年增长２６％。还捧回２０多个省地市级奖状奖杯。全厂１５００多人无一违法，１１５名党员无一违纪。
