The newly opened "God of Wealth" store receives gifts from all directions

The Xi'an City Chang'an County's Xibei Hotel opened on October 8, 1988. Recently, we visited this hotel and saw that the main entrance, dining hall, conference hall, and corridors were all filled with gifts sent by various units in our province. Notably, the gifts from some impoverished areas were particularly luxurious.

For example, in front of the main entrance of the hotel, there stood a pair of stone lions donated by the Suide County People's Government; inside the main entrance hall, there were a pair of large Tang San Cai porcelain vases and a pair of large Tang San Cai horses donated by the Yuncheng City Finance Bureau; the high-end quartz clock donated by the Xianyang City Finance Bureau could report the time of major cities around the world; the Chang'an County Committee and County Government donated a large "Two Dragons Playing with a Pearl" carved wooden frame with two mirrors, flanked by a pair of carved antique flower stands. Additionally, there were: a bamboo woven double-sided embroidered screen and a high-end tapestry donated by the Yan'an Region Finance Bureau; a high-end lacquer screen donated by the Baoji City Finance Bureau; a carved wooden frame large mirror donated by the Fuxian County Government Guest House; a piano donated by the Shaanxi Province Finance Vocational School; a luxurious large billiards table with a scoring device and a large chandelier donated by the Weinan Region Finance Bureau. Shangluo Region is one of the poorer regions in Shaanxi Province, and it alone donated 4 sets of high-end screens.

Why does the Xibei Hotel have such a big face, receiving so many and such valuable gifts at its opening? We inquired and found out that this hotel is jointly managed by the finance departments of the five provinces and autonomous regions in Northwest China, with the Shaanxi Province Finance Department in charge. Is this the reason why various grassroots units are sending gifts? Is it true, as people say, that when the "God of Wealth" has a celebration, who dares not send a gift?

　　“财神”新开店　八方送贺礼
    西安市长安县城的西北饭店，于１９８８年１０月８日开业。最近，我们来到这家饭店，见大门、餐厅、会议厅和走廊里，到处放着我省一些单位赠送的贺礼，特别是一些贫困地区送的礼更为豪华。
    如在饭店主楼大门前，矗立着绥德县人民政府赠送的一对石狮子；主楼门厅内，立着铜川市财政局送的一对大型唐三彩瓷瓶和一对大型唐三彩马；咸阳市财政局赠送的高级石英钟，能报出世界各主要城市的时间；长安县委、县政府赠送的大型“二龙戏珠”雕花木架两面镜，两旁配有一对雕花仿古花盆架。还有：延安地区财政局送的一面藤编双面绣屏和一幅高级挂毯；宝鸡市财政局送的高级漆器屏风；富县政府招待所送的一面雕花木架大镜；陕西省财政专科学校送的一架钢琴；渭南地区财政局赠送的带有计分装置和大吊灯的豪华大型台球案。商洛地区是陕西省较贫困的地区之一，仅高级屏风就送了４套。
    为何西北饭店的面子这样大，开张之际能收到那么多、那么贵重的贺礼呢？我们一打听才知道，原来这家饭店是西北五省、自治区财政厅联办的，由陕西省财政厅主管。难道这就是引起各基层单位纷纷送礼的缘由吗？难道真像人们所说：“财神爷”家里办喜事——哪个敢不送礼！？
