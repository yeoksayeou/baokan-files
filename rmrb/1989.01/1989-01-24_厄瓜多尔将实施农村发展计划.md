Ecuador will implement a rural development plan in the near future to improve the living standards of farmers, the country's Ministry of Social Welfare announced today.

The poverty situation in Ecuador's rural areas is very serious, with 65% of the population living below the absolute poverty line. Among children under six years old, 55% suffer from long-term malnutrition.

In response to this situation, the government has decided to implement the rural development plan in 60 of the country's 147 administrative districts. According to the plan, the government will expand rural employment in the most impoverished areas by encouraging farmers to participate in forestry development, establish small cooperative enterprises, and promote handicraft production. In moderately impoverished areas, the government will focus on developing agricultural potential, promoting the production of domestic consumer goods, and improving dietary structures and production infrastructure. For the least impoverished areas, the government will provide loans and undertake basic construction projects.

In addition, the rural development plan emphasizes the need to strengthen farmers' organizations, maintain ecological balance, and protect natural resources.

　　厄瓜多尔将实施农村发展计划
    新华社基多１月２２日电  厄瓜多尔社会福利部今天宣布，为改善农民的生活水平，政府将在近期内实施一项农村发展计划。
    厄瓜多尔农村地区贫困状况十分严重，有６５％的人口生活在绝对贫困线上，在不满６岁的儿童中，长期营养不良者占５５％。
    针对这种状况，政府决定在全国１４７个行政区中的６０个行政区内实施农村发展计划。根据计划，政府将在一类贫困地区通过招收农民参与林业开发、建立小型合作企业、发展手工艺生产等途径来扩大农村就业人口。在二类贫困地区，政府将着重挖掘农业潜力，促进国内消费食品的生产，改进饮食结构和生产基础设施。对第三类贫困地区则提供贷款和进行基本建设。
    此外，农村发展计划还强调，要加强农民群众组织、保持生态平衡和保护自然资源。
