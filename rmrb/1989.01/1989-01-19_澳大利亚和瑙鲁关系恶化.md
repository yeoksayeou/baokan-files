	Australia and Nauru relations deteriorate
	According to Xinhua News Agency in Canberra on January 18, following Nauru's recent demand that the Australian government recall its High Commissioner to Nauru, Mrs. Beryl Gwyn, relations between Australia and Nauru have worsened.

	Nauru President Hammer DeRoburt formally requested Mrs. Gwyn to leave the country at the end of December last year, accusing her of "unsatisfactory behavior." She had conveyed intelligence about Nauru's aviation safety standards to the Australian and New Zealand governments.

	Australia recalled Mrs. Gwyn on January 17. However, Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans issued a strongly worded protest to Nauru. He warned that Nauru's actions "make it difficult for bilateral relations to continue to improve," and that Nauru should not expect Australia to quickly appoint another High Commissioner.

　　澳大利亚和瑙鲁关系恶化
    据新华社堪培拉１月１８日电  （记者许铖乃）继最近瑙鲁政府要求澳大利亚政府撤回其驻瑙鲁高级专员贝丽斯·格温女士之后，澳大利亚同瑙鲁的关系恶化。
    瑙鲁总统哈默·德罗伯特于去年１２月下旬正式要求格温女士离境，指责她有“不能令人满意的行为”。她向澳大利亚政府和新西兰政府传递了关于瑙鲁航空公司安全标准的情报。
    澳大利亚于１月１７日召回了格温女士。但澳大利亚外交部长加雷斯·埃文斯向瑙鲁发出了措辞强硬的抗议。他警告说，瑙鲁此举“很难使双边关系继续得到改善”，也别再指望澳大利亚很快会向它派驻另一名高级专员。
