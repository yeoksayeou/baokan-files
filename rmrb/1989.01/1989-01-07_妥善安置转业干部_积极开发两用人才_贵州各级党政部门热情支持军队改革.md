The various levels of party and government departments in Guizhou Province have actively supported military reforms, conscientiously handled the resettlement of retired military personnel, and developed the use of dual-use talents. By the end of 1988, the utilization rate of rural demobilized soldiers in the province had reached over 80%, with the utilization rate of dual-use talents reaching over 95%.

During the military's reorganization and streamlining, Guizhou Province welcomed retired military personnel with enthusiasm, ensured their proper resettlement, provided training, and made reasonable use of them. The province also actively and steadily reformed the resettlement work. They not only recommended retired military personnel to accepting units but also facilitated self-recommendations by the personnel to units. The province, adhering to the principle of "training first, then employment" and "learning what is needed for the job," organized 110 training classes for retired military personnel, with over 95% of the eligible personnel receiving training. The province adopted methods such as "vacating, squeezing, renting, and borrowing" to solve the housing difficulties of over 1,500 personnel. The provincial finance department also allocated over 2.8 million yuan to help retired military personnel with housing issues.

The Guizhou Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government pay great attention to the development and use of military-civilian dual-use talents. For dual-use talents, various levels of labor and personnel departments give priority in recruiting during rural labor recruitment, county-owned enterprises give priority in hiring contract workers, and district and township enterprises give priority in accepting them.

　　妥善安置转业干部　积极开发两用人才
    贵州各级党政部门热情支持军队改革
    本报讯  贵州省各级党政部门积极支持军队改革，认真做好军队转业干部安置和两用人才开发使用工作。截至１９８８年底，全省农村籍退伍战士开发使用率达８０％以上，其中两用人才开发使用率达９５％以上。
    军队精简整编期间，贵州省对军队转业干部“热情欢迎，妥善安置，认真培训，合理使用”，并且积极稳妥地对安置工作进行了改革。既向接受单位推荐转业干部，也方便转业干部向单位自荐。全省本着“先培训后上岗”，“干什么学什么”的原则，举办了各类转业干部培训班１１０个，受培训的转业干部占应训人员的９５％以上。全省采取“腾、挤、让、租、借”等办法，解决了１５００多名干部的住房困难。省财政还拨款２８０多万元，帮助转业干部解决住房问题。
    贵州省委、省政府十分重视军地两用人才的开发使用工作。对军地两用人才，各级劳动人事部门在农村招工时优先录用，县属企业招收合同工时优先选用，区、乡办企业优先接收。
