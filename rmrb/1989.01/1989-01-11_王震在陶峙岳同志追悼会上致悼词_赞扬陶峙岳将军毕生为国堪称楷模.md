Today, we mourn with heavy hearts the passing of Comrade Tao Zhiyue, an outstanding member of the Chinese Communist Party, a pioneer of the early democratic revolution, a renowned patriot general, and a vice-chairman of the Sixth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. He was also a senior general of the People's Liberation Army.

Tao Zhiyue was born in Ningxiang County, Hunan Province, in September 1892. He joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1982. In his early years, influenced by bourgeois democratic revolutionary thought, he participated in the Tongmenghui led by Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the Wuchang Uprising, the Protective Rights and Constitutional Protection Wars, and the Northern Expedition. He served as a division commander in the National Revolutionary Army, making significant contributions to overthrowing the feudal warlords' rule and achieving the victory of the Great Revolution.

After the outbreak of the War of Resistance against Japan, General Tao Zhiyue served as the commander of the 76th Army of the Kuomintang. He supported the Chinese Communist Party's correct proposal of "opposing civil war and uniting to resist Japan," filled with patriotic fervor, and actively participated in the War of Resistance against Japan. In September 1937, he led his troops from Shaanxi to Shanghai to aid in the famous "August 13" resistance. In the battle, he led from the front, commanded decisively, and together with the broad masses of soldiers, struck a blow to the invaders' arrogance, demonstrating the national spirit of the Chinese people and the fearless spirit of the anti-Japanese soldiers. In 1947, during his tenure as the deputy commander of the Northwest Military and Political Affairs Commission and the commander-in-chief of the Xinjiang Garrison, General Tao Zhiyue actively supported the political proposals of peace and democracy, released a large number of Communist Party members and progressive figures imprisoned in Xinjiang, and personally sent people to escort them back to Yan'an. On the eve of the founding of the People's Republic of China, he followed the historical trend, broke through numerous obstacles, and resolutely declared a rebellion on September 25, 1949, in Xinjiang, leading his troops to accept the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. This made significant contributions to the peaceful liberation of Xinjiang, the maintenance of national unity and ethnic solidarity, and the establishment of New China.

In the early days of Xinjiang's peaceful liberation, Comrade Tao Zhiyue, in accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Central Military Commission, worked to unite military and political personnel, maintain ethnic solidarity and local order, abolish old systems, implement new systems, and issued the "Letter to All Soldiers in Xinjiang." He actively propagated the great significance of peaceful liberation and the policies of the Communist Party of China, seriously rectified social order, suppressed bandit rebellions, severely punished lawbreakers, protected the lives and property of the people, and vigorously restored and developed production. This played an important role in stabilizing the situation in Xinjiang. During his tenure as the commander of the 22nd Army Group, deputy commander of the Xinjiang Military Region, and commander of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, he carefully and meticulously carried out the reorganization and reform of the rebel troops, establishing a renowned production and construction army known both domestically and internationally. He conscientiously implemented the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao Zedong on land reclamation and border defense, often went deep into the reclamation areas to inspect and guide work, and personally participated in land reclamation, canal construction, and tree planting activities. His footprints covered the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, and he worked hard to develop agricultural, pastoral, industrial, commercial, and transportation production. He actively implemented the Party's ethnic policies, did a great deal of work to strengthen the unity of the various ethnic groups in Xinjiang, help local ethnic minority masses improve their material and cultural lives, and promote the economic prosperity and cultural progress of the northwestern border. He won the support and love of the broad masses of soldiers and civilians in Xinjiang.

During his tenure as a leader of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the Hunan Provincial People's Congress, he paid great attention to the major affairs of the Party and the state, the construction of the army, and often participated in various meetings despite his illness. He made new contributions to the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and to the national defense cause. In 1955, he was awarded the rank of senior general and received the First-Class Liberation Medal of the People's Republic of China. In 1988, he was awarded the Victory Honor Medal of the People's Liberation Army. He wholeheartedly supported the line, principles, and policies of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, consciously maintaining a high degree of consistency with the Party Central Committee in ideology and politics. He firmly supported and implemented the policy of "one country, two systems" proposed by the Party Central Committee and Comrade Deng Xiaoping, actively engaged in united front work, and propagated the superiority of the socialist system and the great achievements of the modernization drive of the motherland. He warmly received overseas and mainland visitors and former Kuomintang military and political figures, personally handled letters and visits from well-known figures, the masses, and people's organizations. He yearned for the early return of Taiwan to the motherland and made unremitting efforts to achieve the great cause of national reunification.

Comrade Tao Zhiyue was an outstanding descendant of the Chinese nation. He firmly believed in the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and regarded joining the Chinese Communist Party as his greatest pursuit in the latter half of his life. He consciously regulated his words and deeds according to the Party Constitution. At the age of 90, he was honored to join the Chinese Communist Party. Comrade Tao Zhiyue cherished his honor and never boasted of his merits. Despite his advanced age and frail health, he insisted on studying diligently and working tirelessly. He was modest and prudent, approachable, and led by example, maintaining close ties with the masses and uniting with his comrades. He had a clean and upright style of work, was open and aboveboard, and strictly required his children and staff. He worked diligently and conscientiously, devoting his life to the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction, and to the construction of the people's army.

The passing of Comrade Tao Zhiyue is a great loss to our Party, state, and army. His pursuit of the truth of communism, his love for the motherland, and his modest and prudent, clean and upright style will forever be worth learning from. We should turn our grief into strength, guided by the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, study hard, work diligently, unite as one, and strive for the victory of reform and opening up and construction, for the realization of the four modernizations and the great cause of national reunification, and for the building of a modernized and regular revolutionary army!

Comrade Tao Zhiyue will live forever in our hearts!

    赞扬陶峙岳将军毕生为国堪称楷模
    新华社长沙１月１０日电  国家副主席王震在陶峙岳同志追悼会上致的悼词
    今天，我们怀着极其沉痛的心情，深切悼念中国共产党的优秀党员，早期民主主义革命的先锋战士，著名爱国将领，中国人民政治协商会议第六届全国委员会副主席，中国人民解放军的高级将领陶峙岳同志。
    陶峙岳同志是湖南省宁乡县人，出生于１８９２年９月，１９８２年加入中国共产党。他早年受资产阶级民主革命思想影响，参加了孙中山先生领导的同盟会和武昌起义、护国护法战争，并参加了北伐战争，曾任国民革命军团长，为推翻封建军阀的统治，取得大革命的胜利，作出了重要贡献。
    抗日战争爆发后，陶峙岳将军任国民党第７６军军长。他拥护中国共产党提出的“反对内战，一致抗日”的正确主张，满怀爱国主义激情，积极投身抗日战争。１９３７年９月，他率部从陕西驰援上海，参与著名的“八·一三”抗战。在作战中，他身先士卒，指挥果断，与广大官兵一起打击了侵略者的气焰，表现了中国人民的民族气节和抗日将士的大无畏精神。１９４７年，陶峙岳将军在任国民党西北军政长官公署副长官兼新疆警备总司令期间，积极拥护和平民主的政治主张，释放关押在新疆监狱的一大批共产党员和进步人士，并亲自派人将他们护送回延安。在中华人民共和国成立前夕，他顺应历史潮流，冲破重重阻挠，毅然于１９４９年９月２５日在新疆率所部将士通电起义，接受中国共产党的领导，为和平解放新疆，维护祖国统一和民族团结，为新中国的建立，作出了重大贡献。
    在新疆和平解放初期，陶峙岳同志根据中共中央、中央军委的指示，为团结军政人员，维护民族团结和地方秩序，废除旧制度，实行新制度，发布了《告全疆将士书》，积极宣传和平解放的重大意义和中国共产党的方针政策，认真整顿社会治安，平息残匪叛乱，严惩不法分子，保卫人民生命财产安全，大力恢复和发展生产，对稳定新疆局势起了重要作用。他在任中国人民解放军第２２兵团司令员、新疆军区副司令员兼新疆生产建设兵团司令员期间，认真细致地做好起义部队的整编和改造工作，建立了一支饮誉中外的生产建设大军。他认真贯彻党中央和毛泽东主席的垦荒戍边的指示，经常深入垦区检查指导工作，并亲自参加垦荒、开渠、植树等活动，足迹遍及天山南北，为发展农牧工交商业生产努力工作。他积极贯彻执行党的民族政策，为加强新疆各民族的团结，帮助当地各族人民群众改善物质和文化生活，促进西北边疆的经济繁荣、文化进步，做了大量的工作，受到了新疆广大军民的拥护和爱戴。
    他在担任全国政协和湖南省人大领导职务期间，十分关心党和国家大事，关心军队建设，经常抱病参加各种会议，为社会主义革命和社会主义建设，为我国的国防事业，作出了新的贡献。他１９５５年被授予上将军衔，荣获中华人民共和国一级解放勋章，１９８８年被授予中国人民解放军胜利功勋荣誉章。他衷心拥护党的十一届三中全会以来的路线、方针、政策，自觉地在思想上政治上同党中央保持高度一致。他坚决拥护和贯彻党中央、邓小平同志提出的关于“一国两制”的方针，积极从事统战工作，宣传社会主义制度的优越性和祖国四化建设的巨大成就，热情接待回大陆观光、省亲的中外知名人士和国民党军政故旧，亲自处理知名人士、群众和人民团体的来信来访。他渴望台湾早日回归祖国怀抱，为实现祖国统一大业作出了不懈努力。
    陶峙岳同志是中华民族的优秀子孙，他坚信中国共产党的领导，把加入中国共产党作为他后半生的最大追求。他自觉地按照党章要求规范自己的言行，在９０岁高龄时，光荣地加入了中国共产党。陶峙岳同志十分珍惜自己的荣誉，从不居功自傲。他不顾年迈体弱，坚持认真看书学习，孜孜不倦地工作。他谦虚谨慎，平易近人，以身作则，联系群众，团结同志；他作风正派，光明磊落，严格要求自己的子女和身边的工作人员；他工作深入，勤勤恳恳，为社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业，为人民军队的建设，付出了自己的毕生精力。
    陶峙岳同志与世长辞，是我们党、国家和军队的一大损失。他追求共产主义的真理，热爱祖国的精神和谦虚谨慎、为政廉洁的作风永远值得我们学习。我们要化悲痛为力量，在党的十三届三中全会精神指引下，努力学习，奋发工作，同心同德，为改革开放和建设的胜利，为实现社会主义四个现代化和祖国统一大业，为建设一支现代化、正规化的革命军队而努力奋斗！
    陶峙岳同志永垂不朽！
