The secretary of the Military Commission's Discipline Inspection Commission and deputy director of the General Political Department, General Guo Linxiang, recently visited the 5th Company of a certain pontoon bridge unit in the Guangzhou Military Region and the 2nd Maintenance Squadron of a certain air force unit. He discussed the situation with the officers and soldiers, listened to their voices, and understood their hardships at the grassroots level.

Guo Linxiang came among the soldiers of the 5th Company of the pontoon bridge. The soldiers spoke enthusiastically, with some asking how to view the rapid rise in prices in the context of reform and opening up. Others expressed their doubts about the existing issues of unfair distribution and corruption. Guo Linxiang cited some data and facts, providing a realistic analysis of issues such as price increases, and introduced the measures taken by the Party and the state to address these problems. Everyone nodded in agreement.

During the meeting, officers and soldiers from the two grassroots units expressed their opinions on grassroots construction. Some officers reported that grassroots work is demanding and stressful. Guo Linxiang said that grassroots work is indeed very hard. This year, we will greatly improve our leadership style and do more practical things for the grassroots. As grassroots officers, we should also advocate for a broader perspective, a spirit of dedication, and strive to do a good job at the grassroots level. Some soldiers suggested that the cultural life in the company is monotonous and hoped that the leadership could help solve this issue. Guo Linxiang introduced some measures recently taken by the Military Commission to ensure the life of the troops and encouraged grassroots officers to come up with their own ways to enrich the soldiers' cultural life.

During the discussion, everyone also raised some questions and suggestions regarding whether outstanding squad leaders can study at military academies for promotion, the placement of transferred officers, and so on. Guo Linxiang listened carefully and answered each question. He guided and enlightened the officers and soldiers on issues related to their ideological understanding and explained the policies and regulations for those who were not familiar with them. For some practical difficulties at the grassroots level, he discussed solutions with the relevant leaders on the spot.
