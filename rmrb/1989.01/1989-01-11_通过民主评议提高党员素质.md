Establishing a system of democratic appraisal of party members is an important measure for strict party governance and improving the quality of party members. It is an effective method of strengthening the education, management, and supervision of party members through institutional building. In accordance with the requirements of the Central Committee, conducting democratic appraisal of party members is of great significance for fully playing the leading role of the Party and the exemplary role of party members in the current efforts to rectify the economic environment, improve economic order, and deepen comprehensive reforms.

To achieve effective results in the democratic appraisal of party members and prevent it from becoming a mere formality, two key points must be emphasized: first, adhering to party member standards; second, conducting thorough criticism and self-criticism.

The Party Constitution clearly stipulates the conditions for party members and party cadres. In his report to the Third Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee, Zhao Ziyang also clearly outlined how to verify and assess the party spirit of party members and party cadres in the new situation. Conducting democratic appraisal of party members should first organize party members to review these regulations and requirements, raising their awareness of becoming qualified party members in the new era. On this basis, they should seriously review their thoughts, work, and study, especially their understanding, attitude, and actions regarding deepening reforms, maintaining integrity, and strengthening discipline. They should acknowledge their achievements, identify their shortcomings, and clarify their direction of effort. Currently, some party members use the standards of a law-abiding citizen to judge themselves, often feeling self-satisfied. Some use the excuse that others do not demand much of themselves to justify their own shortcomings, both of which are incorrect. As members of the vanguard of the working class, they must use the standards set by the Party Constitution to regulate and constrain themselves. This is the minimum requirement for every party member. The idea of lowering party member standards or verbally agreeing to strict party governance but not wanting to be constrained by party rules and regulations should be corrected through the appraisal process.

The process of democratic appraisal is, in essence, a process of conducting criticism and self-criticism. Through serious and pragmatic criticism and self-criticism, everyone can truly benefit in their thoughts. Currently, there is a bad tendency where party life does not adhere to principles or right and wrong, where people do not want to engage in serious self-criticism or criticize others, and where everyone is just fine, leading to a very vulgar atmosphere. This situation should be changed during the appraisal.

For most regions, democratic appraisal of party members is the first time. The main effort should be focused on encouraging the advanced and helping the lagging. This way, the positive factors within the party can be effectively supported and promoted, negative factors can be overcome, and party members in an intermediate state can be inspired, so that the democratic appraisal can achieve the expected results. The handling of unqualified party members should be both resolute, to prevent being too lenient, and cautious, to seek proper solutions. Conducting this once a year in conjunction with the democratic appraisal can improve the situation of the party organization. After two or three years, experiences can be accumulated and the system can be improved, laying a foundation for doing this work regularly in the future.

The fact that some party members are unqualified or do not play their exemplary role well is often directly related to the weak and scattered leadership of the grassroots party organizations. Therefore, democratic appraisal of party members should be combined with strengthening the construction of grassroots party organization leadership teams, using democratic appraisal to further solve the problems within the leadership teams.

If the democratic appraisal of party members in party and government organs is conducted well, it can serve as a model. All levels of party and government organs should use the appraisal to conduct in-depth education on clean governance, maintaining the overall situation, and strictly observing discipline for all party member cadres, advancing the work of the organs. Every party member in the organs, whether an ordinary member or a leading cadre, should participate in the study and appraisal without exception, accepting supervision and education.

　　通过民主评议提高党员素质
    本报评论员
    建立民主评议党员制度，是从严治党，提高党员素质的一项重要措施，是通过制度建设加强对党员进行经常性的教育、管理、监督的有效方法。按照中央的要求，认真搞好党员评议工作，对于当前在治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序、全面深化改革中充分发挥党的领导核心作用和党员的先锋模范作用，无疑具有重要意义。
    民主评议党员要取得成效、防止走过场，关键有两条：一是坚持党员标准。二是认真开展批评与自我批评。
    党章对党员、党的干部的条件，规定得很明确。赵紫阳在党的十三届三中全会的报告中，对在新形势下如何检验和考核党员和党的干部的党性，也提出了明确的要求。开展民主评议党员工作，首先要组织党员重温这些规定和要求，提高做新时期合格党员的自觉性。在此基础上，认真回顾个人思想、工作、学习等方面的情况，特别是对深化改革、保持廉洁、加强纪律的认识、态度和行动，肯定成绩，找出差距，明确努力方向。现在，党内有些同志以守法公民的标准要求自己，因而常常“自我感觉良好”；有的同志借口他人自我要求不严来为自己开脱，都是不对的。作为工人阶级先锋队的一员，必须以党章规定的党员标准来规范和约束自己。这是对每一个党员的起码的要求。降低党员标准，或者口头上赞成从严治党，实际上却不愿意用党规党法约束自己的想法，应当在评议中认真加以纠正。
    民主评议的过程，实际上也是开展批评与自我批评的过程。通过严肃认真的、实事求是的批评和自我批评，大家才能在思想上真正有所收获。现在有一种不好的风气，党内生活不讲原则，不讲是非，既不愿做认真的自我批评，更不愿批评别人，你好，我好，大家好，搞得很庸俗。在评议中，要注意改变这种状况。
    对多数地区来说，民主评议党员是第一次。要把主要精力用在抓好鼓励先进和帮助后进上。这样，就可以有效地扶持和发扬党内的积极因素，克服消极因素，激励处于中间状态的党员，使民主评议达到预期的目的。对不合格党员的处置，既要坚决，防止失之过宽，又要慎重，力求妥善。每年结合民主评议进行一次，一些原来不合格的党员经过教育转变了，一些经教育无效的劝退或除名了，党组织的状况就会有明显改善。两三年后，还可以积累经验、完善制度，为今后做好这项经常性工作打下基础。
    一些党员不合格，或者先锋模范作用发挥得不好，往往与基层党组织的领导班子软弱涣散直接有关。因此，要将民主评议党员同加强基层党组织的班子建设结合起来，通过民主评议，进一步解决领导班子自身存在的问题。
    党政机关民主评议党员活动开展好了，可以起到示范作用。各级党政机关要通过评议，对全体党员干部进行深入的清政廉洁、顾全大局和严守法纪的教育，使机关工作前进一步。机关的每一名党员，无论是普通党员还是领导干部，都应当无例外地认真参加学习和评议，接受监督和教育。
