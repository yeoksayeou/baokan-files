We women of Minnan are good at keeping silent. But in this silence, the women of Hui'an have unique attire, the women of Quanzhou love to adorn their hair with fresh flowers, the women of Xiamen always wear the latest international fashions, and the women of Zhangzhou have windows adorned with water lilies. Only the women of Dongshan Island have no color, working in the dry sandy soil, wearing bamboo hats, and from a distance, they look like men.

When the women of a place do not know how to adorn themselves, this place must have deep sorrow and a strong hope.

Dongshan Island is the southernmost island of Fujian Province. It has the most beautiful beaches, the clearest sea water, and the purest fishing villages in the country. It is just that the scenery and sunshine of the island have been sealed off for more than 30 years under the shadow of war. The island still has abandoned military camps and fortresses everywhere.

In 1953, the Kuomintang army crossed the sea from the Penghu Islands overnight and occupied part of Dongshan Island. The People's Liberation Army gathered its forces to counterattack and recaptured the occupied half of the island. This is the famous "Battle of Dongshan." Dongshan Island has a large martyrs' cemetery, burying the martyrs who sacrificed themselves in this battle. Now the tombstones have been eroded by time to a dark green color, but the tragic words still record the hatred of the past.

In the past, Dongshan Island was famous for its vigorous female militia. They carried guns, with bullets hanging from their bodies, and under the moonlight, their quiet ranks on the beach were reflected, with bayonets gleaming in the dark. But behind the female militia were entire villages of widows. The men were all taken away by the Kuomintang army, and the fishing villages have shed women's bitter tears for more than 30 years.

Dongshan Island was once an ancient port that engaged in trade with the world even earlier than the ancient port of Quanzhou, experiencing commercial prosperity and destruction by war. Dongshan Island has been plundered and occupied countless times by pirates. Zheng Chenggong used it as a military base for his anti-Qing and pro-Ming campaign, and the Qing army bloodily massacred the entire island many times. The men were all killed, and the old and young women were driven away. They were driven away and then returned, and the women of Dongshan Island gave birth to a new generation of male infants. Countless stories of joy and sorrow, and the separation of kin, make up the history of Dongshan Island.

Messy hair and dirty faces are the women of war, not wearing makeup is the woman preparing for battle, black clothes and pants are the woman who misses her husband who cannot return home. When will the women of Dongshan Island have a peaceful time to adorn themselves?

On Dongshan Island, fishing boats set out in groups in the middle of the night. Men push the large fishing boats, shouting slogans, walking from the beach into the sea, and women on the beach plant incense sticks like planting rice seedlings, kneeling in rows on the shore until dawn without getting up.

Their prayers are so specific: asking the sea not to take away their husbands and sons, asking the warships not to shoot at their fathers and brothers, asking the ports on the other side to shelter their men from the wind and rain. Just asking them to return alive and safely!

The people of Dongshan Island live by the sea, and their feelings are entirely different from those on land. When does a woman become a widow? As long as her husband does not come down from the boat! When the men of several families are all drowned in the sea, it leaves silent wives and daughters! What is more precious than life? Even when the war clouds hang over the strait, the fishermen on both sides quietly help each other at sea, a little fresh water, a little fuel oil, a little rice. If they meet someone from their hometown, they tell them a little news from home.

Constant war and separation make the people of Dongshan Island no longer believe in gods or Buddhas. The island does not even have a large temple of the sea goddess Mazu. Dongshan Island only has a temple of Guan Yu, and they only believe in human justice, human loyalty, and friendship that never betrays.

Who wants their bones to float in the sea and be eaten by fish? The men of Dongshan Island, when they encounter unidentified corpses at sea, will definitely retrieve them and return the entire ship to bury them. Burying the misfortune of others is like finding a reliable home for oneself. The tombs around the fishing villages are circled with stones, and the incense inside is never extinguished. Red cloth strips flutter everywhere. The women of Dongshan Island often come to take care of the unidentified souls, offering them some wine and food, as if they were their own deceased relatives. They often tell their wishes to these unidentified souls. They believe that once these souls accept their prayers, they will bless their men who are tossed about at sea.

The wish for peace is thus piled up day by day, covering all kinds of hatred, until the sun drives away the clouds of today. The fishing boats from the other side have come, the merchant ships have come, and the men who were taken away have returned. The women of Dongshan Island, however, have only rough hands and dark, cracked faces, exchanging their youth and beauty for a peaceful island.

There are wars, famines, and racial discrimination all over the world. The women in these places will be like the women of Dongshan, losing the most precious things of a woman, clutching the hem of the goddess of peace, crawling in the dust, and giving birth to their daughters in the ruins.

### 和平之岛

　　和平之岛
    唐敏
    我们闽南妇女是善于沉默的女性。但在沉默中，惠安女子有奇特的服饰，泉州深沪女子爱用鲜花堆满发髻，厦门女子总着国际流行的时装，漳州女人有水仙花装点的窗口。只有东山岛的妇女没有一点色彩，她们在干旱的砂质地里劳作，戴着竹笠，远远望去像男人一样。
    当一个地方的女人不善妆扮自己时，这地方必定有深刻的悲痛，也必定有强烈的祈望。
    东山岛是福建省最南端的海岛，它有全国最美的沙滩，最清的海水，最纯的渔村。只是那一岛的风情和阳光在战争的阴云下封锁了３０多年，岛上至今还处处留下废弃的军营和碉堡。
    １９５３年，国民党的军队一夜之间从澎湖列岛渡海而来，攻占了东山岛的一部分，人民解放军集结强兵反击，收复了被占的半个岛。这是著名的“东山战役”。东山岛有一个很大的烈士陵园，埋葬着在这次战役中献身的烈士。如今墓碑已被岁月蚀成暗绿色，悲愤的文字却记载着过去的仇恨。
    过去，东山岛闻名于世的是飒爽英姿的女民兵，她们荷着枪，身上挂满子弹，月色映出她们在海滩上静静的队列，刺刀发出暗光。可在女民兵的背后是整村的寡妇。被国民党军队抓光了男人，渔村里流了３０多年女人辛酸的泪。
    东山岛曾是比泉州古港更早对世界通商的古代大港口，有过商业的繁荣，又毁于战争。东山岛被海盗无数次地掠夺和强占。郑成功用它做反清复明的军事基地，清朝军队多次血洗全岛。男人被杀光了，老少妇孺被赶光了。赶走了又回来，东山岛的女人又生下新一茬的男婴。无数的悲欢离合，骨肉分割的故事组成东山岛的历史。
    蓬头垢面是战乱中的女人，不施铅华是准备打战的女人，黑色衣裤是思念无法回家的丈夫的女人。什么时候让东山岛的女人有打扮自己的宁静岁月呢？
    在东山岛，渔船成群地出海总是在下半夜。男人们推着大大的渔船，喊着号子，从沙滩走下大海，女人们在沙滩上插秧似的插上线香，成排地长跪在岸边直到天亮也不起身。
    她们的祈求是那么具体，求大海不要夺走她们的丈夫、儿子，求军舰不要射击她们的父亲兄弟，求对岸的港口在暴风雨中能容她们的男人稍避风雨。只求他们能够活着平安地归来！
    东山岛人靠大海生活，感受绝不同于陆地上的人们。什么时候一个女人就成了寡妇？只要船上不再走下她的丈夫！什么时候几家的男人都翻到了海里，便留下默默无言的妻子女儿！有什么比生命更可贵的？就是在战争阴云笼罩海峡时，两岸的渔民在海上悄悄地互相帮对方一把，一点淡水，一点柴油，一点大米。碰到原来的同乡人，就告诉一点家乡的人事。
    总是战争总是隔绝，使东山人不再信神信佛，岛上甚至没有一个规模稍大的海神妈祖的庙。东山岛只有关公的庙，他们只相信人的正义，相信人的忠诚，相信友谊永不背叛。
    谁愿意自己的尸骨漂浮大海被鱼群吞吃？东山岛的男人出海碰到海上的无名尸骨，一定要捞起来，全船返回安葬他们。埋葬他人的不幸，如同为自己找到可靠的归宿。渔村周围这些义冢用石头圈着，圈内终年香火不绝，红色的小布条缕缕飘起。东山岛的女人时常来照看无名的亡灵，给他们供些酒菜，如同对待自己的亡亲。她们常向这些无名的灵魂诉说心愿，她们相信这些灵魂一旦接受了他们的祈告，便会保佑她们在海中颠簸的男人。
    和平的愿望就这样一天天朴素地堆积着，覆盖了各种各样的仇恨，直到阳光驱散乌云的今天。对岸的渔船来了，商船来了，被抓走的男人也回来了。东山岛的女人却只有粗糙的双手和黧黑皲裂的脸孔了，她们的青春容颜换来了一座和平的海岛。
    世界上到处有战争、灾荒和种族歧视，这些地方的女人就会和东山的女人一样，丢失了女人最宝贵的一切，死死拉住和平之神的袍角，在尘埃中爬着，在废墟中生下她们的女儿。　　　　　　　　　（作者单位：福建省厦门市文联）
