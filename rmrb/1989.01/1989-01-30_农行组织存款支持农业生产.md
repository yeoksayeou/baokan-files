The Agricultural Bank of China's Deputy Governor Wang Jingshi said at the closing of the Agricultural Bank's national branch managers' meeting today that the bank's top priority at present is to organize savings deposits and to do everything possible to support agricultural production.

Wang Jingshi emphasized that this year's rural financial work is more complex and arduous than in previous years. In the first half of the year, the focus should be on supporting agricultural production and arranging the order of fund usage:

Firstly, ensure the payment of deposits, which is fundamental to stabilizing finance and maintaining credibility. It is essential to guarantee "voluntary deposits and free withdrawals." Secondly, support the procurement and supply of agricultural production materials urgently needed for spring farming, such as fertilizers, pesticides, and plastic films, to ensure timely agricultural operations. Thirdly, promptly issue loans for grain, cotton, and oil production costs, and pre-purchase deposit loans, and do everything possible to work with relevant departments to redeem the "white slips" in farmers' hands before the Spring Festival. Fourthly, support the "vegetable basket project" to develop the production of meat, poultry, eggs, and dairy products.

　　农行组织存款支持农业生产
    本报讯  本报记者江夏、新华社记者焦然报道：中国农业银行副行长王景师在今天闭幕的农行全国分行行长会议上说，当前农行第一位的工作，就是要千方百计地组织储蓄存款，尽一切努力支持农业生产。
    王景师强调说，今年农村金融工作的任务比往年更加复杂和繁重。上半年要围绕支持农业生产，安排好资金使用顺序：
    首先是保存款支付，这是稳定金融、维护信誉的根本，一定要保证做到“存款自愿、取款自由”；二是支持春耕生产急需的化肥、农药、薄膜等农业生产资料的采购和供应，做到不误农时；三是及时发放粮、棉、油生产费用贷款和预购定金贷款，尽一切努力，配合有关部门在春节前兑现农民手中的“白条”；四是支持“菜篮子工程”，发展肉、禽、蛋、奶等副食品生产。
