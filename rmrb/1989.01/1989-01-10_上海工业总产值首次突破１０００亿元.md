Shanghai's industrial output value has exceeded 100 billion yuan for the first time. According to a report from our Shanghai bureau, amidst the nationwide trend of overheated growth, Shanghai has maintained a steady development pace. Last year, Shanghai achieved two major breakthroughs: its gross national product reached 61.2 billion yuan for the first time, and its industrial output value surpassed 107.777 billion yuan.

It is understood that in 1988, Shanghai made new progress in adjusting its industrial and product structures, strengthening enterprise management, and developing an export-oriented economy. Industries characterized by high technology, such as aerospace, power station equipment manufacturing, instrumentation and electronics, and computers, have become Shanghai's leading industries. The value of industrial exports reached 14.025 billion yuan, an increase of 16% over the previous year.
