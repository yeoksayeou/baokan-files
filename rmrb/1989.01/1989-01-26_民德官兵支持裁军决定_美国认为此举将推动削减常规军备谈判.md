East German Defense Minister Keßler stated on the 24th that all soldiers of the National People's Army fully support the decision to reduce the military by 10,000 personnel and corresponding equipment by the end of 1990, believing that this will benefit the security and stability of Europe.

At a meeting held at the Ministry of Defense, the defense minister explained to the leaders of the National People's Army, border troops, and civil defense forces the significance of this important decision made by the Democratic Republic of Germany, as well as the measures to implement this decision and the tasks of the military in the new situation.

Keßler said that after reducing its armed forces, the Democratic Republic of Germany will further emphasize the defensive nature of its military. He said that this important step by the Democratic Republic of Germany is closely linked to its policy of dialogue and peaceful coexistence.

Keßler stated that the armed forces of the Democratic Republic of Germany still bear the responsibility of defending the people and socialism. He emphasized that the East German military will continue to fight alongside the armed forces of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries to defend peace and socialism.

The State Department spokesman Redman today welcomed the unilateral disarmament decision by the Democratic Republic of Germany and said that this disarmament decision will "greatly promote the negotiation of new conventional arms reductions."

The leader of the Democratic Republic of Germany, Honecker, announced on the 23rd that the Democratic Republic of Germany will unilaterally disarm 100,000 personnel, reduce 600 tanks and 500 combat aircraft, and cut military spending by 10%.

The United States has long believed that the Warsaw Pact forces have an advantage in conventional weapons and has demanded that the Warsaw Pact forces reduce this advantage. Redman said that the decision by the Democratic Republic of Germany means acknowledging the advantage of the Warsaw Pact in Europe. At the same time, Redman also said that this decision by the Democratic Republic of Germany will not affect NATO's plans for the modernization of nuclear weapons, because the Warsaw Pact forces "have a significant advantage in almost all areas of armaments."

    美国认为此举将推动削减常规军备谈判
    新华社柏林１月２４日电  民主德国国防部长克斯勒２４日发表讲话说，国家人民军全体官兵完全支持关于到１９９０年底以前军队裁员１万名和削减相应装备的决定，认为这样做有利于欧洲的安全和稳定。
    在国防部举行的会议上，这位国防部长向国家人民军、边防部队和民防部队的将领们阐明了民主德国这一重要决策的意义，以及贯彻这一决策的措施和军队在新形势下的任务。
    克斯勒说，民主德国在裁减武装力量后，将更加突出军队的防御性质。他说，民主德国的这一重要步骤是同其对话和和平共处政策紧密联系在一起的。
    克斯勒表示，民主德国武装力量仍然肩负着保卫人民、保卫社会主义的重任。他强调，民德军队今后仍将同苏联和其它社会主义国家武装力量一起，为保卫和平和社会主义而奋斗。
    新华社华盛顿１月２４日电　国务院发言人雷德曼今天对民主德国单方面裁军的决定表示欢迎，并说这一裁军决定将会“大大推动新的削减常规军备的谈判”。
    民主德国领导人昂纳克２３日宣布，民主德国将单方面裁军１０万人，削减６００辆坦克和５００架作战飞机，同时削减军费１０％。
    美国长期以来一直认为华约条约部队在常规军备方面占有优势，并要求华约部队削减这方面的优势。雷德曼说，民主德国的决定意味着承认华沙集团在欧洲存在优势。同时雷德曼还说，民主德国的这一决定不会影响北约组织关于核武器现代化的计划，因为华约部队“在几乎所有军备方面都占有不小的优势”。
