The United Nations Security Council, after five days of emergency meetings discussing the US shooting down of two Libyan aircraft, voted on a draft resolution today. Due to vetoes from the US, UK, France, and other countries, the resolution did not pass.

The draft resolution, proposed by Algeria and seven other non-aligned countries in the Security Council, expressed regret over the US shooting down of two Libyan reconnaissance aircraft. It called for the US to stop military exercises off the coast of Libya and urged all parties involved to exercise restraint and resolve the dispute peacefully. During the vote, China and nine other countries voted in favor, while the US, UK, France, and Canada voted against. Finland and Brazil abstained.

Yesterday, Libyan representative Trayki expressed concern that the US might continue to violate Libyan airspace. He pointed out that the Libyan government had received a notice from the US stating that the 6th Fleet would conduct air exercises in Libyan airspace east of Benghazi on January 16 and 17. US representative Oken immediately responded that the Libyan representative's statement was hard to believe and that he would clarify the facts to the Security Council later. However, he did not provide any clarification during today's meeting.

A few days ago, the Palestinian permanent observer to the United Nations wrote to the Security Council chairman requesting to attend this emergency meeting. During off-site consultations, due to the US's firm opposition, no consensus was reached. Today, the meeting voted on the procedural issue of this request, with 11 votes in favor and only the US voting against. Therefore, the meeting invited the Palestinian representative to attend and speak. This is the first time a Palestinian observer has attended a United Nations meeting, affirming the 43rd United Nations General Assembly's resolution in December to replace the PLO with the State of Palestine as the United Nations observer.

　　由于美英法等国反对
    安理会关于美击落利机提案被否决
    巴勒斯坦国观察员首次应邀列席会议
    本报联合国１月１１日电  记者刘开宸报道：联合国安全理事会在审议美国击落两架利比亚飞机事件的５天紧急会议后，今天下午就一项决议草案进行表决，由于美、英、法等国否决，未获通过。
    这项由阿尔及利亚等安理会中７个不结盟国家提出的决议草案，对美国击落两架利比亚侦察机表示遗憾，要求美国停止在利比亚海岸外的军事演习，并要求有关各方克制，以和平办法解决争端。表决时，中国等９国赞成，美国、英国、法国和加拿大等４国反对，芬兰和巴西两国弃权。
    昨天，利比亚代表特赖基在发言中担心美国继续侵犯利比亚。他指出：利比亚政府接到了美国通知说，第６舰队将在１月１６、１７两日在班加西以东的利比亚领空进行空军演习。美国代表奥肯立即回答说，利代表的说法难以置信，他将在以后向安理会说明事实真相，可是他在今天会议上未作澄清。
    几天前，巴勒斯坦常驻联合国观察员写信给安理会主席要求列席此紧急会议。在会外磋商中，由于美国坚决反对未能达成协商一致意见。今天会上以程序问题就此要求进行表决，结果１１票赞成，只有美国反对。于是，会议邀请了巴勒斯坦代表列席会议并发言。这也是巴勒斯坦国观察员第一次出席联合国组织会议，肯定了第４３届联合国大会去年１２月日内瓦会议关于以巴勒斯坦国代替巴解组织作为联合国观察员的决议。
