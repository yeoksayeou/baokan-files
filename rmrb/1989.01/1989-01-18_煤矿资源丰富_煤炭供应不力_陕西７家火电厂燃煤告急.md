	Coal resources are abundant in Shaanxi, but the supply of coal is insufficient. Seven thermal power plants in the province are facing a coal crisis.

	On January 7, the Northwest Electric Power Administration submitted an urgent report to the State Energy Department stating that as of that day, the coal reserves in Shaanxi's thermal power plants had dropped to 800,000 tons, below the warning line, and all seven thermal power plants in the province were in dire straits.

	Coincidentally, the same day's issue of the Shaanxi Daily reported that the province's total coal reserves amounted to 909.6 billion tons, currently ranking second in the country, just behind the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.

	It is understood that the seven thermal power plants in Shaanxi, which account for 55.5% of the total installed capacity of thermal power in the Northwest Power Grid, are supplied with coal according to the national plan by several mining bureaus within the province. Starting from the second half of last year, a supply-demand contradiction emerged. Although the electric power sector also actively organized the use of non-planned coal to make up for the shortfall, due to price restrictions within the province, a large amount of non-planned coal flowed to regions outside the province that were willing to pay higher prices. Since last December, the coal reserves in Shaanxi's thermal power plants have been on a downward trend. After the New Year, the average coal consumption per day was 100,000 tons, leading to the current crisis.

	Recently, the Shaanxi Provincial Economic Commission, the Provincial Coal Industry Bureau, the Northwest Electric Power Administration, and the Xi'an Railway Bureau jointly held a meeting to study and formulate countermeasures. After the meeting, the Xi'an Railway Bureau immediately arranged for the daily transportation of 362 cars of coal for power generation; the Northwest Electric Power Administration strengthened day and night duty, helping each power plant to unload coal as it arrives; the Provincial Coal Industry Bureau required each mining bureau to consider the overall situation, increase coal production, and ensure coordinated transportation and supply. For coal supplied from outside the province according to contracts, the principle is not to supply according to non-planned arrangements. As of January 12, the daily coal supply has increased to 205,000 tons, but the coal consumption is still greater than the coal supply, and the coal for power generation is still in short supply. It is reported that the insufficient coal supply is the key to the contradiction. In recent years, coal production, which has been neglected, urgently needs to be re-emphasized by the relevant departments of the province.

	Relevant parties believe that if drastic measures are not taken to solve the "coal shortage," it will exacerbate the "power shortage," thereby affecting industrial and agricultural production and people's daily power use. Being in a "coal sea" but facing a "coal crisis" is indeed strange!

### 煤矿资源丰富　煤炭供应不力  陕西７家火电厂燃煤告急

　　煤矿资源丰富　煤炭供应不力
    陕西７家火电厂燃煤告急
    本报西安电  记者景险峰报道：１月７日，西北电业管理局呈送国家能源部的一份紧急报告称：截至当日，陕西火电厂存煤仅８万吨，低于存煤警戒线，全省７家火电厂纷纷告急。
    无巧不成书。同日出版的《陕西日报》公布：全省煤炭资源总储量达９０９６亿吨，目前仅次于新疆自治区，跃居全国第二位。
    据了解，占西北电网火电装机总容量５５．５％的陕西７家火电厂，发电用煤按照国家计划安排，全部由陕西省内几个矿物局供应。去年下半年开始，煤炭的供需发生矛盾。电业部门虽也积极组织计划外用煤加以弥补，但由于省内限制购价，大批计划外煤炭，源源流向外省愿出高价的地区。去年１２月份以来，陕西火电厂存煤量一直呈现下降趋势。今年元旦过后，平均每３天挖用库存煤１万吨，导致上述危机发生。
    最近，陕西省经委、省煤炭厅、西北电管局和西安铁路分局共同开会研究制订对策。会后，西铁分局连夜安排每天发运３６２车发电用煤的计划；西北电管局加强昼夜值班，帮助各火电厂当日到煤、当日卸车；省煤炭厅要求各矿务局顾全大局，增强煤炭生产，做到调运协调，确保供应。对省外按订货合同供给，原则上不按计划外供应。截至１月１２日，今年日均供煤量提高到２．０５万吨，但耗煤量仍大于进煤量，目前发电用煤仍处于紧缺状态。据悉，煤源不足是矛盾焦点所在，近年来被冷落了的煤炭生产，急需省有关部门重新重视起来。
    有关方面认为，如不采取过硬手段解决“煤荒”，将会使“电荒”加剧，进而影响工农业生产和人民生活用电。身处“煤海”，却又告“燃煤之急”，岂不怪哉！
