Anyone who has a basic understanding of the current state of Soviet literary studies knows that Academician Likhachov (1906-) is a leading figure in the study of ancient Russian literature, a renowned literary scholar and textual critic in the world. He has conducted systematic and in-depth research on ancient Russian literature and culture, and has proposed many important theoretical questions in literary studies, achieving fruitful results in many areas, and has had a significant impact on Soviet and even global Slavic scholars.

Among Likhachov's extensive scholarly works, although there are masterpieces (such as "Textual Criticism," 1962; "The Poetry of Ancient Russian Literature," 1979), for Chinese readers, it is his translations and studies of "The Tale of Igor's Campaign" that are more familiar.

"The Tale of Igor's Campaign" is a masterpiece of ancient Russian literature, a gem of the Russian poetic world, and has long been regarded as an epic, attracting widespread attention in the global literary arena.

Regarding Soviet studies on "The Tale of Igor's Campaign," in the nearly two hundred years since the first printed edition (1800) was published, it can be said that the research has been continuously innovative and enduring. Many famous writers, poets, and linguists have studied "The Tale of Igor's Campaign." To this day, such research in the Soviet Union is flourishing, and specialized papers are constantly emerging. According to Likhachov's book "The Tale of Igor's Campaign and the Culture of That Era" (1986), Likhachov alone has written 39 scholarly works, 23 articles, and 32 general reviews on this epic. The versions he has translated and annotated are numerous, including poetic versions, prose versions, academic editions, and children's editions, among others. As for the accuracy of the translations and the precision of the insights, Likhachov is unanimously recognized as the authority in the Soviet Union today. This epic is not only well-known in the Soviet Union but has also been widely spread abroad, reportedly translated into more than 70 languages. And most of these translations are based on Likhachov's translations, with the Chinese translation being an example.

For this scholar whom I have long admired, although I have frequently studied his works since the 1950s, I have always regretted not having the opportunity to meet him and seek his advice. It was not until the 800th anniversary commemorative conference of "The Tale of Igor's Campaign" held in Moscow in January 1986 that I finally fulfilled my long-held wish. He was not the feeble old man I had imagined, but a tall, gentle, and kind elderly scholar. After the opening ceremony, he was the first to give a special speech, leaving a deep impression with his concise and meaningful remarks. He said: "Rare ancient documents always enjoy the honor of representing the entire culture. And 'The Tale of Igor's Campaign' is the splendid manifestation of the Kievan Rus' culture of the 11th to 12th centuries, marked by chronicles, murals, and architecture." After the opening ceremony, various Slavic scholars, out of admiration for him, rushed to the stage to shake his hand and express their greetings. When I presented him with "The Tale of Igor's Campaign," he shook my hand again to thank me. And in my book, he wrote: "I am happy that China has once again participated in our cultural activities."

　　德·利哈乔夫与《伊戈尔远征记》
    魏荒弩
    凡是对苏联文艺学现状稍有涉猎的人，都知道利哈乔夫院士（１９０６—）是苏联当今研究古俄罗斯文学的耆宿，世界知名的文艺学家和版本学家。他对古俄罗斯文学和文化进行了系统而深入的研究，并在文艺学上提出不少重要的理论问题，在多方面取得丰硕的成果，对苏联乃至全世界斯拉夫学者产生了很大影响。
    在利哈乔夫宏富的科学著作中，虽不乏扛鼎之作（如《版本学》，１９６２；《古俄罗斯文学的诗体》，１９７９），但对中国读者来说，还是对他为《伊戈尔远征记》所作译释和研究较为熟悉。
    《远征记》是古俄罗斯文学的杰作，俄国诗坛的瑰宝，一向被称为史诗，在世界文坛引起了广泛的注意。
    关于苏联对《远征记》的研究工作，在第一个印刷本（１８００）出版以后将近两百年的时间里，可以说是日新月异，经久不衰。许多著名的文学家、诗人、语言学家几乎都研究过《远征记》。直到目前，这种研究工作在苏联蔚然成风，已经形成了一种专门学问，专题论文不断涌现。据利哈乔夫《〈伊戈尔远征记〉和那个时代的文化》（１９８６）一书所载，仅利哈乔夫院士一人所写有关这一史诗的学术著作就有３９种，论文２３篇，一般评介３２篇。经他翻译和铨释的版本就有多种，其中有韵文本，有散文本，有科学院版，有儿童读物版，不一而足。至于译文的确切，见解的精当，利哈乔夫更是当今苏联一致公认的权威。这部史诗不仅在苏联已是家喻户晓，而且在国外也得到广泛传播，据说已被译成７０多种文字。而其中绝大部分又都是根据利哈乔夫的译本译出的，我国的中译本就是一例。
    对这位心仪已久的学者，笔者虽从５０年代就经常研读他的著作，但终以无缘识荆、当面请教为憾。直到１９８６年１月在莫斯科举行的纪念《远征记》创作８００周年大会上，方得一偿宿愿。他不是我所想象的那副龙钟老态，而是一位身材颀长、态度和蔼的温厚长者。开幕后，他第一个作专题发言，那言简意赅的警句，给人留下深刻的印象。他说：“举世罕见的古文献，总是享有代表整个文化的荣誉的。而《远征记》，则是１１至１２世纪以编年史、壁画和建筑为标志的基辅罗斯文化的辉煌表现。”开幕式后，各国斯拉夫学者出于对他的景仰，一时蜂拥至主席台前，争相与他握手致意。当我以《远征记》奉赠的时候，他便再一次与我握手道谢。并在我的本上写下题词：“我为中国重又参加我们的文化活动而感到高兴。”
