Over the past ten days, stepping into the circular hall of the China Art Museum has been like entering the artistic realm of the Night Kingdom. The art exhibition of Liu Yong, a Buyi ethnic minority artist from Guizhou who calls himself a "Night Person," has been held here from January 11 to 22.

Using contemporary consciousness to reflect on ancient art, and employing modern techniques to depict the rustic customs of the people, is a notable feature of this exhibition. The large ceramic piece "The Daughter of Gaoxin" is a prime example of this approach. In the hands of this artist, various materials become art. The "Night Kingdom Bamboo King," made from a bamboo winnowing basket, broom, and broomstick, is vivid and lifelike. Liu Yong, who started with caricature and is skilled in sculpture and ceramics, leverages his "hybrid advantages" to create numerous works that combine multiple art forms and metaphorically reflect contemporary society. These types of works in the exhibition are also favored by the audience.

　　“夜郎人”刘雍在京举办美展
    新华社北京１月２２日电（记者袁晞）这１０余天，置身中国美术馆圆大厅仿佛闯入夜郎国的艺术天地，自称“夜郎人”的贵州布依族美术家刘雍美术作品展１１日至２２日在这里举办。
    用当代意识观照久远的艺术，用现代技法表现古朴的民风是展览的一大特色，大型陶器《高辛氏的女儿》就是这样的作品。在这位艺术家手中，各种材料都入艺术，用竹簸箕、刷把、扫帚制作的《夜郎竹王》形神俱在。以漫画起家，又精于雕塑、陶艺的刘雍发挥“杂交优势”，创作了不少多种艺术结合，隐喻现实社会的作品，展览中的这类作品也为观众青睐。
