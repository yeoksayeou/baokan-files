	Xu Shuqin is an ordinary female cadre in the Labor and Personnel Bureau of Wuzhong City, Ningxia. In December 1986, the Labor and Personnel Bureau of Wuzhong City violated relevant regulations and changed Zhang Ninglan, a female worker from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Department of Wuzhong City People's Hospital, from a collective worker to a permanent state-owned worker. Last May, the Discipline Inspection Commission of Wuzhong City concluded that the actions of the Labor and Personnel Bureau were incorrect, but decided to maintain Zhang Ninglan's current work status. Afterwards, Zhang Ninglan unjustly suspected that Xu Shuqin had reported her, and began to frequently insult and abuse Xu Shuqin.

	Last June 6th in the morning, as Xu Shuqin was just leaving her building, she "coincidentally" encountered Zhang Ninglan, who lived in another unit of the same building. Without saying a word, Zhang Ninglan spat on Xu. Xu endured the insult without responding, but Zhang became even more aggressive, cursing with filthy language that was unbearable to hear. Later, Xu Shuqin went to the office building of the Labor and Personnel Bureau to work, but was intercepted and insulted by Zhang Ninglan and her aunt, Zhang Guixiang (the head of the Individual and Private Economy Management Section of the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce, whose husband is the Vice Chairman of the Municipal Political Consultative Conference and former director of the Municipal Labor and Personnel Bureau). Zhang Ninglan's husband (who works in the Municipal Labor and Personnel Bureau) was present throughout, cheering them on. Subsequently, Zhang Ninglan entered the office building of the Municipal Labor and Personnel Bureau and caused a disturbance, disrupting the office order for a period.

	Faced with this endless insult and abuse, Xu Shuqin repeatedly requested the judicial authorities to handle the matter according to law, but the relevant departments pushed the responsibility back and forth. Some leaders even said, "The situation is complicated, and too many people are involved. We can't handle it alone. Let's wait and see how things develop..." This emboldened Zhang Ninglan and others, making her even more unscrupulous.

	Xu Shuqin appeals to society to uphold justice and cries out: Who is responsible for this matter?

　　徐淑琴长期遭受侮辱谩骂
    有关单位互相推诿踢皮球
    徐淑琴是宁夏吴忠市劳动人事局一名普通女干部。１９８６年１２月，吴忠市劳动人事局违反有关规定，将吴忠市人民医院中医门诊部女工张宁兰由集体工转为国营固定工。去年５月，吴忠市纪律检查委员会认为劳动人事局的做法是错误的，但决定维持张宁兰的工作现状。事后，张宁兰无端怀疑是徐淑琴告的状，便经常侮辱、谩骂徐淑琴。
    去年６月６日早晨，徐淑琴刚出楼门，便与住在同楼另一单元的张宁兰“巧遇”。张宁兰二话没说，就向徐身上吐唾沫。徐忍辱没理睬，张又变本加厉地破口大骂，语言之污秽，不堪入耳。尔后，徐淑琴来到市劳动人事局大楼上班，又被张宁兰及其姨妈张桂香（市工商局个体工商户管理股股长，其夫为市政协副主席、原市劳动人事局局长）等人拦住辱骂。张宁兰的丈夫（在市劳动人事局工作）始终在场助威。接着，张宁兰又走进市劳动人事局大楼无理取闹，致使该局办公秩序一度受到干扰。
    面对这种无休止的侮辱、谩骂，徐淑琴几次请求司法部门依法处理，但有关部门互相推诿。个别领导还说，此事情况复杂，涉及的人太多，我们一家难办，等事情发展了再说……这就助长了张宁兰等人的气焰，她更加有恃无恐。
    徐淑琴呼吁社会主持公正，哭着问道：此事究竟由谁来管？
