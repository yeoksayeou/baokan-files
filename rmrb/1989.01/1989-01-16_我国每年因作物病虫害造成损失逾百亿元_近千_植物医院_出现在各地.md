People's Daily reports: Correspondent Jiang Jianke reports: When people fall ill, they can go to the hospital; when livestock and poultry fall ill, they can go to the veterinary clinic. Now, crops that cannot speak or walk can also be taken to a "plant hospital" for treatment when they suffer from pests and diseases.

"Plant hospitals" are set up by grassroots plant protection technical personnel on their own initiative. They generally have an outpatient room, a pest and disease control training room, and a drug dispensing station, and operate on a paid service basis.

Statistics show that China suffers over 10 billion yuan in losses annually due to crop pests and diseases. Each year, the cost of producing pesticides and manual labor for pest control amounts to 1 to 2 billion yuan.

Faced with this grim reality, a group of grassroots technical personnel with a sense of social responsibility have been actively exploring ways to promote plant protection technology under the new system. The first "plant hospital" in China was established in October 1985 in Ruichang County, Jiangxi Province. Subsequently, provinces such as Liaoning, Shandong, and Hebei saw the emergence of a batch of "plant hospitals." It is understood that this type of hospital has now developed to nearly 1,000 across the country.

These "plant hospitals" vary in service methods and technical levels due to differences in economic development across regions. They are generally located at the county or township level. They genuinely serve the farmers, some of whom not only prescribe but also sell medicines, avoiding the previous problem of mismatched supply and demand, and reducing errors such as missing the treatment window, drug damage, pesticide ineffectiveness, human and animal poisoning, and environmental pollution that often occur during the treatment process. Their service methods are flexible and diverse. The most common is for farmers to bring living or dead crop samples, and the "plant doctors" diagnose them, or invite "plant doctors" for on-site diagnosis. Some "plant hospitals" also regularly dispatch "plant doctors" to go to the countryside for diagnosis.

According to an official from the Ministry of Agriculture, the reactions and evaluations of various places to the emergence of "plant hospitals" are not uniform. The Standing Committee of the People's Congress of Hebei Province passed a bill approving the operation of pesticides by "plant hospitals." In Nandu County, Sichuan Province, 10 out of 28 townships have specially solved the pension problem for "plant doctors." However, some places support it one moment and do not support it the next; some maintain silence and do not express an opinion. This official anxiously said: At present, many "plant hospitals" are in a dilemma of internal worries (upper-level management departments taking 10% to 30% of their income) and external threats (relevant operating departments restricting and preventing them from operating pesticides). "Plant hospitals" are a product of China's rural science and technology system reform. Local authorities should consider the bigger picture and do their best to support these "green guardians."

### 我国每年因作物病虫害造成损失逾百亿元  近千“植物医院”出现在各地

　　我国每年因作物病虫害造成损失逾百亿元
    近千“植物医院”出现在各地
    本报讯  记者蒋建科报道：人生了病，可以上医院；家畜家禽生了病，不妨到兽医院去。如今，既不会说话、又不能走路的庄稼发生病虫害，也能由主人送到“植物医院”里诊治。
    “植物医院”是基层植保专业技术人员自发开设的。一般设有门诊室、病虫防治培训室和配药站，实行有偿服务。
    据统计，我国每年因作物病虫害造成的损失超过１００亿元，每年为此花费的农药生产费及手工费，多达１０—２０亿元。
    面对严峻的现实，一批有社会责任感的基层技术人员四处奔走，探索在新体制下推广植保技术的路子。我国第一家“植物医院”１９８５年１０月在江西瑞昌县诞生。随后，辽宁、山东、河北等省相继涌现出一批“植物医院”。据了解，这类医院目前在全国已发展到近千家。
    这些“植物医院”因各地经济发展水平不一，服务方式及技术水平也不尽相同，一般都设在县级及乡镇一级。他们真心实意为农民服务，有的既开方、又卖药，避免了以前开方卖药不配套而产生的供需脱节、药不对路问题，也减少了防治过程中常常出现的错过防治时机、产生药害、农药失效、人畜中毒、污染环境等失误。他们的服务方式灵活多样，最常见的是由农民带着活的或死的庄稼标本，由“植物医生”诊断，或请“植医”实地诊断。一些“植物医院”还定期派出“植物医生”，下乡巡诊。
    据农业部一位官员透露，对“植物医院”的出现，各地的反应和评价不一。河北省人大常委会通过议案，同意“植物医院”经营农药。四川省南部县２８个乡中，有１０个乡已专门为“植物医生”解决了退休金问题。但有的地方对它时而支持，时而不支持；有的保持沉默，不表态。这位官员忧心忡忡地说：目前许多“植物医院”处在内忧（上级主管部门伸手提取其收入的１０％—３０％）、外患（有关经营部门限制、阻止其经营农药）的两难境地。“植物医院”是我国农村科技体制改革的产物，各地应从大局出发，尽力支持这批“绿色卫士”。
