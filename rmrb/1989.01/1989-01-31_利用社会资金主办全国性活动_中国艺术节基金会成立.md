Utilizing social funds and forces to host national-level art activities, breaking away from the traditional practice of relying solely on government allocations, is a reform measure taken by the Ministry of Culture in recent years. This measure was successfully implemented during the first China Arts Festival in 1987. Practice has proven that there is potential in society for cultural development. Tapping into this potential will ensure that the China Arts Festival becomes a high-quality, mass, and socially significant large-scale art event with global significance.

The China Arts Festival Foundation, a nationwide non-profit social organization aimed at promoting the prosperity of China's cultural and artistic endeavors and expanding cultural exchanges between China and the world, was established today in Beijing after receiving approval from the State Council. This was announced by Ying Ruocheng, Vice Minister of Culture, at a press conference held for both domestic and foreign journalists.

The foundation's funds will primarily come from voluntary donations from domestic and foreign individuals and organizations (including donations from compatriots in Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, as well as overseas Chinese), assistance from relevant state departments, and donations received for activities organized to promote the China Arts Festival. These funds will be used for expenses directly related to the festival, and government departments will not be able to divert them. Donors will enjoy the relevant rights stipulated in the foundation's charter.

The board of directors of the China Arts Festival Foundation consists of 28 top artists and renowned cultural figures in China. Currently, the foundation is actively raising funds for the second China Arts Festival, which is scheduled to be held in Beijing this autumn.

　　利用社会资金主办全国性活动    
    中国艺术节基金会成立
    本报北京１月３０日讯  记者易凯报道：一个旨在促进中国文化艺术事业的繁荣、扩大中国与世界文化交流、专门募集资金以支持中国艺术节的全国性非盈利社会团体——中国艺术节基金会，经国务院批准后，今天在北京成立。这是文化部副部长英若诚在此间举行的中外记者招待会上宣布的。
    利用社会资金和力量主办全国性艺术活动，一改以往单纯依靠政府拨款统包统揽的传统做法，是近年来文化部管理体制的一项改革措施。这项措施在１９８７年第一届中国艺术节上取得成功。实践证明，社会上蕴藏着办文化的潜力，开发这些潜力，将保证中国艺术节成为具有世界性意义的高质量、群众性、社会性的大型文艺活动。
    中国艺术节基金会的基金来源主要是：国内外单位和个人的自愿捐赠（包括港、澳、台同胞及海外华侨的捐赠），国家有关部门的资助，以及为宣传中国艺术节组织的有关活动所接受的捐赠基金。这些基金将用于与艺术节直接有关的开销，政府部门不得挪用。赞助者将享有基金会章程制定的有关权益。
    中国艺术节基金会理事会由２８位我国第一流艺术家和知名文化活动家所组成。目前，该会正为今秋在北京举办的第二届艺术节积极筹款。
