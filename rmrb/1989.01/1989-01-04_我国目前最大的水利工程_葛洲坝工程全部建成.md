The largest hydropower project in China at present—the Gezhouba Hydropower Project on the Yangtze River—has been fully completed with the successful trial navigation of its last ship lock and the operation of its last generator unit. This marks the completion of the project one year ahead of the designed schedule. (For details, see the second page report.)

The project, located in Yichang, Hubei Province, is a key water control project on the middle reaches of the Yangtze River. It is designed to generate electricity, control floods, facilitate navigation, and provide irrigation water. The main structures of the project include a powerhouse with 21 generator units, each with a capacity of 250,000 kilowatts, and a ship lock with a double-line, five-step design. The total installed capacity of the powerhouse is 5.25 million kilowatts, making it one of the largest hydropower stations in the world.

The construction of the Gezhouba Project began in December 1970. Over the past 18 years, the project has overcome numerous difficulties and challenges, including the Tangshan earthquake in 1976, the severe flood in 1980, and the economic reforms and adjustments in the 1980s. Despite these obstacles, the project has been completed ahead of schedule, demonstrating the Chinese people's indomitable spirit and their ability to accomplish great feats.

The completion of the Gezhouba Project is of great significance for the development of China's hydropower resources, the improvement of the Yangtze River's navigation conditions, and the promotion of the economic development of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. It is a major achievement in China's water conservancy and hydropower construction, and it has set a good example for other water conservancy and hydropower projects in the country.
