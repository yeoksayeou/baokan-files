To support economic adjustment and make more contributions, China's petroleum industry will accelerate development.

	Beijing, January 17th — How to accelerate the growth of energy sources such as oil and natural gas, and coordinate them with the development of the national economy? State Councilor Zhou Jia Hua pointed out at the closing of the National Petroleum Industry Conference today that the state, in adjusting the industrial structure, has determined to increase energy production as a major strategic measure to ease the supply-demand contradiction. He emphasized that the petroleum industry, in the process of rectification and reorganization, should not slow down but accelerate development, producing more oil and gas to support the adjustment of the national economy and ensure the stable development of the national economy. This is a glorious task facing the petroleum front.

	During the conference, Premier Li Peng, Vice Premier Yao Yi Lin, and State Councilor Zhou Jia Hua specially listened to the report on the petroleum industry and made important speeches.

	In discussing the acceleration of the development of the petroleum industry, Zhou Jia Hua believed that the policy of "increasing reserves and production" is correct. He stressed the importance of strengthening geological exploration and increasing reserves, which is the primary task and focus of the petroleum front. He said that oil and gas reserves are the material basis for production development. Without reserves, there is no production, and only with increased reserves can production be increased, ensuring the sustainable development of production.

	Zhou Jia Hua also required the petroleum front to not only strive to find new reserves and continuously develop new oil fields but also to refine and strengthen old oil fields, using new technologies and techniques to significantly reduce the natural decline in oil and gas production. On the basis of stable production, achieve increased production and maintain a sustained and stable increase in oil and gas production.

	Zhou Jia Hua also required that the China National Petroleum Corporation be transformed into a genuine economic entity, gradually transitioning to economic entity operations under the guidance of national policies, conducting independent operations, independent accounting, and unified profit and loss. He said that the State Council will create conditions, take necessary policy measures, and rationalize various relationships to strive to change the current situation where oil and gas production incurs policy losses and construction funds are insufficient. The corporation should also transform its functions, improve its operating mechanisms, tap into internal potential, and enhance its self-development capabilities.

	At the meeting, Zhou Jia Hua and other leaders presented the "National Second-Class Enterprise Certificate" to eight units: Daqing Petroleum Administration Bureau, Jilin Province Oil Field Administration Bureau, Xi'an Petroleum Exploration Instrument Factory, Fushun Petroleum Machinery Factory, Daqing Petroleum Administration Bureau General Machinery Factory, Xinjiang Petroleum Administration Bureau Dushanzi Refinery, Jianghan Petroleum Administration Bureau Drill Bit Factory, and Jianghan Petroleum Administration Bureau Fourth Machinery Factory. Energy Minister Huang Yi Cheng attended the meeting and spoke.

### 为支持经济调整多作贡献  我国石油工业将加快发展

　　为支持经济调整多作贡献
　　我国石油工业将加快发展
    本报北京１月１７日讯  记者高新庆、张何平报道：如何加快石油、天然气等能源的增长速度，使之与国民经济的发展相互协调起来？国务委员邹家华在今天闭幕的全国石油工业会议上指出，国家在调整产业结构中，确定把努力增加能源生产，缓解能源供需矛盾，作为一项重要的战略措施来抓。他强调，石油工业在治理、整顿中，不是要放慢速度，而是要加快发展，生产更多的油气支持国民经济调整，保障全国经济的稳定发展。这是摆在石油战线面前的光荣任务。
    会议期间，李鹏总理、姚依林副总理、邹家华国务委员专门听取了关于石油工业的汇报，并作了重要讲话。
    在谈到加快石油工业的发展时，邹家华认为“增储上产”的方针，是一条正确的方针。他强调加强地质勘探，增加后备储量，是石油战线的第一位任务和工作重点。他说，油气储量是发展生产的物质基础。没有储量也就没有产量，储量增长了产量才能搞上去，生产发展就有后劲。
    邹家华还要求石油战线在努力寻找新的储量和不断开发新的油田同时，还要在老油田上精雕细刻，攻坚啃硬，采用新的工艺技术，以大量的工作减缓油气产量的自然递减。在稳产的基础上实现增产，保持油气产量的持续稳定增长。
    邹家华还要求把中国石油天然气总公司努力办成真正的经济实体，使总公司逐步过渡到按经济实体经营，在国家方针、政策指导下，进行自主经营、独立核算、统负盈亏。他说，国务院要给总公司创造条件，采取必要的政策性措施，理顺各方面关系，努力改变目前那种油气生产发生政策性亏损、建设资金入不敷出的状况。总公司也要转变职能，改善经营机制，努力挖掘内部潜力，增强自我发展的能力。
    会上，邹家华等领导同志还向大庆石油管理局、吉林省油田管理局、西安石油勘探仪器总厂、抚顺石油机械厂、大庆石油管理局总机械厂、新疆石油管理局独山子炼油厂、江汉石油管理局钻头厂、江汉石油管理局第四机械厂八个单位，颁发了国家二级企业证书。能源部长黄毅诚参加会议并讲了话。
