Norway has invented a new type of ice skate. According to a report by a Swedish newspaper, former coach of the Norwegian national ice skating team, Finn Halvorsen, and others recently designed a new ice skate. It is believed that this ice skate can bring about a revolutionary change in ice skating, similar to how fiberglass skis replaced wooden skis in skiing.

This new ice skate uses new materials, with the shoe and blade integrated into one piece, weighing about half as much as a regular ice skate. The design minimizes air resistance as much as possible, and the shape conforms to the shape of the human foot. Two types of skates have already been produced: one with a running blade and one with a figure skating blade. The designers are currently in contact with relevant companies to strive for mass production.

According to the report, some excellent ice skaters who have tried this new ice skate are very satisfied with the product. According to a professor's calculation, using this new ice skate, a skater's 500-meter time can be improved by 0.5 seconds, and a 10,000-meter time can be improved by 10 seconds. The main reason for the improvement in performance is that this new ice skate is 30% to 50% lighter than a regular ice skate.

　　挪威发明一种新冰鞋
    新华社斯德哥尔摩１月１７日电  据瑞典报纸报道，挪威国家滑冰队前教练费恩·哈尔沃森等人最近设计出一种新冰鞋。据认为这种冰鞋可以引起滑冰运动的革命性变化，就像在滑雪运动中玻璃纤维滑雪板代替木制滑雪板一样。
    这种冰鞋使用了新材料，鞋与冰刀融为一体，其重量约是普通冰鞋的一半。新冰鞋在设计上注意到尽可能减少空气阻力，式样上与人的脚形相符。现已造出的鞋有两种，一种带跑刀，一种带球刀。设计者目前正与有关公司联系，争取成批生产。
    据报道，试用过这种冰鞋的一些优秀滑冰运动员，都对这一新产品表示非常满意。据一位教授计算，使用这种冰鞋，一名滑冰运动员跑５００米成绩可提高０．５秒，跑１万米可提高１０秒。成绩提高的主要原因是这种新冰鞋比普通冰鞋轻３０％至５０％。
