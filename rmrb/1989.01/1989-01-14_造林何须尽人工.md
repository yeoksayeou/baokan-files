Afforestation does not necessarily require human effort. The practice of closing mountains for afforestation was widely implemented in China during the 1950s. Due to its effective greening results, it was praised by foreigners as the "Chinese afforestation method." In recent years, this method seems to have fallen out of favor. Many people, when discussing forestry construction, focus on creating engineered forests and investing capital, resulting in a constant call for more investment. Given China's current national conditions, while concentrating a small amount of investment to create high-standard timber forests, it is also effective to vigorously promote closing mountains for afforestation to accelerate the greening of vast barren mountains.

In many places in China, especially in the southern regions, the climate is warm and humid with abundant rainfall, suitable for the growth of various trees. If there are a few mother trees per acre, and the mountains are closed off, within a few years, dense forests can be regenerated. This method requires minimal investment and is not slow in greening. Since the growth of trees is not restricted, a mix of coniferous and broad-leaved trees, shrubs, and grasses interweave in layers, resulting in good stratification and high coverage. In terms of ecological benefits such as soil and water conservation, water retention, and environmental beautification, it is not inferior to engineered forests.

An important task of forestry construction is to provide a large amount of timber for economic construction. To this end, concentrating limited funds to produce more timber on a smaller area of land through intensive management is an important way to resolve the timber shortage. However, this is just one approach to forestry construction. China still has over 100 million acres of barren mountains that need greening, and relying solely on engineered forests cannot solve the problem of large-scale greening of barren mountains. Closing mountains for afforestation can make up for this deficiency. In the reform of forestry management methods, we should adopt a two-pronged approach, and in places with suitable conditions, we should implement closing mountains for afforestation according to local conditions.

Implementing closing mountains for afforestation requires solving two problems. First is management. Closing without managing is equivalent to not closing. Of course, some investment is needed, along with certain regulations and local customs, to establish a forest protection team. Second, the problem of firewood for the people and fodder for livestock must be solved, which is a prerequisite for closing mountains for afforestation. Localities can implement full closure, partial closure, or rotational closure based on specific conditions. Wengyuan County, while closing mountains for afforestation, vigorously promoted fuel conversion and firewood saving to reduce resource consumption. Their experience is worth emulating by other places.

### 造林何须尽人工

　　造林何须尽人工
    封山育林，５０年代曾在我国广为推行。由于绿化效果不错，被外国人誉为“中国造林法”。近些年，封山育林的办法似乎不那么时兴了。不少人一提林业建设，就是造工程林，就要投资，结果“缺投资”的呼声不绝。从我国目前的国情看，在集中少量投资营造高标准用材林的同时，大力实行封山育林，是加快大面积荒山绿化的一条有效途径。
    在我国许多地方，特别是南方地区，气候温湿，雨量充沛，适宜各种树木的生长。如果每亩地有几株母树，再把山封起来，不出几年，就可繁衍出茂密的山林。这种办法投资少，绿化速度也不慢。由于林木生长不拘一格，针阔叶树种、乔灌草上下交织，层次好，覆盖度高。从保持水土、涵养水源、美化环境等生态效果看，并不亚于工程林。
    林业建设的一个重要任务，是为经济建设提供大量用材。为此，集中有限资金，在较少的山地上，通过集约经营生产出较多的木材，是解决用材矛盾的重要途径。然而这只是林业建设的一种办法，我国还有１０多亿亩荒山需要绿化，光靠造工程林解决不了大面积荒山绿化问题，封山育林正可弥补这个不足。在林业经营方式的变革中，我们要两条腿走路，在有条件的地方，都应因地制宜实行封山育林。
    实行封山育林，有两个问题需要解决。一是管护。光封不管，等于不封。当然也要投一点资，还要有一定的制度和乡规民约，建立一支护林队伍。二是要解决群众烧柴和牲畜牧草问题，这是封山育林的前提。各地可根据具体情况，实行全封、半封或轮封。翁源县在封山育林的同时，大力推行改燃节柴，减少资源消耗。他们的经验值得各地借鉴。
