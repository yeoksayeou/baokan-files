The 15th meeting of the Politburo of the CPC Central Committee was held on January 27, chaired by Comrade Zhao Ziyang, to discuss strengthening legal work and stabilizing social order in the new situation of reform and opening up.

The meeting noted that social order is a major concern for the broad masses. Strengthening legal work and maintaining social stability are crucial for improving the economic environment, rectifying economic order, and deepening comprehensive reforms. They are also the wish of the broad masses of the people. From the Central Committee to local party committees, the principle of "one hand for construction, one hand for law enforcement" must be adhered to. Leadership over legal work must be strengthened, and more attention and support must be given to legal work.

The meeting pointed out that social order issues are a reflection of various social contradictions. Solving social order problems requires mobilizing the entire society, using education, management, legal means, and other methods to eliminate factors that endanger social order, and implementing comprehensive governance.

The meeting emphasized the need to combine comprehensive governance with concentrated strikes and concentrated rectification. First, efforts should be focused on improving social order in large and medium-sized cities, major transportation routes, and coastal open areas. The policy of severely punishing serious criminals in accordance with the law should be continued, and concentrated efforts should be made to crack down on criminal activities that seriously endanger society, reform and opening up, and economic construction. For areas, venues, units, and industries with chaotic order and widespread public complaints, the main leaders should take charge, organize special forces, and carry out concentrated rectification. At the same time, grassroots organization building, spiritual civilization building, socialist democracy, and legal system building must be strengthened to fundamentally consolidate the foundation of social order.

The meeting emphasized the need to continue strengthening the construction of the legal workforce and improving the political and professional qualities of the broad legal and public security personnel. Legal departments should establish education, training, and assessment systems for personnel based on actual conditions, and continue to replenish and improve the legal workforce. The core and fortress roles of party organizations at all levels within legal departments must be fully utilized to strengthen ideological and political work and uphold clean governance. Legal departments should proactively accept supervision from supervisory agencies and the masses, strictly govern themselves, and seriously investigate and punish illegal and disciplinary actions within the legal workforce. Party committees and governments at all levels should actively help legal departments improve working conditions.

13 members of the Politburo, 1 alternate member of the Politburo, and 4 members of the Politburo were absent due to official duties. Comrade Zhao Ziyang, General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee, made an important speech. Relevant department heads from the Central Committee attended the meeting.
