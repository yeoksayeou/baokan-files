Autumn Xia Garden is a famous scenic spot in Jiading County, Shanghai, and is one of the renowned classical gardens in southern Jiangnan. It was originally the private garden of Gong Hong, the Minister of Works during the Ming Dynasty.

Although Autumn Xia Garden is not large, it is exquisitely designed, with a compact structure and intricate layout. The garden features rolling hills and serene waters, reminiscent of the Lion Grove Garden in Suzhou. The Ming Dynasty painter Dong Qichang inscribed the garden with the words "Ten Mu within." The garden includes numerous scenic spots such as Shu Yu Zhai, San Yin Tang, Song Feng Tang, Ying Yu Di, Sui Han Jing, Bai Hua Tai, Tao Hua Tan, Sa Xue Lang, Ji Shan Ting, Ning Xia Ge, Bi Guang Ting, Chi Shang Cao Tang, and Bi Wu Xuan.

"The Four-Sided Hall" is the main building of the garden. Sitting quietly in the hall, one can enjoy the reflections of the pond and the scenery on land. To the east of the hall, there is a stone peak shaped like an ancient zither lying horizontally, hence the name "Horizontal Zither."

The dry boat "Poolside Cottage" is situated south of the small hill and north of the clear water. From here, one can lean on the railing and overlook the clear pond water and the lotus flowers swaying in the wind. Inside the dry boat, there is a mirror that reflects the mountains, trees, and lake scenery, harmonizing with the garden's landscape. The dry boat is adorned with couplets and scrolls by Ming Dynasty scholars from Jiading and modern calligraphers and painters.

To the west of the dry boat, there are three stone stars representing Happiness, Prosperity, and Longevity. North of the three stars is the Chong Gui Xuan, named for the osmanthus flowers that surround it. Both in front of and behind the pavilion, as well as to the left and right, osmanthus flowers are planted. Among them, two ancient osmanthus trees, over a hundred years old, still stand tall and vibrant. During the osmanthus blossom season, standing in the Chong Gui Xuan and inhaling the fragrant scent of the flowers is an intoxicating experience. Behind the pavilion is a small courtyard adorned with plum blossoms, osmanthus, camellias, and lake rocks, forming a delicate "garden within a garden."

Adjacent to Autumn Xia Garden is the City God Temple, another ancient site. It was first built during the Southern Song Dynasty's Jiading period and has been expanded several times, making it grand and ancient in style. During the Qingming Festival, the Ghost Festival (seventh month fifteenth), and the first day of the tenth lunar month, the temple is crowded with visitors. The Qing Dynasty scholar Qian Daxin wrote a poem about it: "Blossoms open finely, catching the eye, / Girls sing and dance in the lanes. / After burning incense, they stroll in the garden, / Returning to the garden hall for playful banter." The poem mentions Yan Yuan Xuan, another scenic spot in the temple's rear garden.

　　秋霞圃
    赵春华
    秋霞圃是上海市嘉定县的名胜，系江南著名的古典园林之一。它最早是明代工部尚书龚弘的私人花园。
    秋霞圃虽占地不大，却小巧玲珑、结构紧凑、布局精致，山具丘壑之美，水揽幽邃之胜，颇有苏州狮子林的风格。明代书画家董其昌为该园题“十亩之间”。其中有数雨斋、三隐堂、松风堂、莺语堤、岁寒径、百花台、桃花潭、洒雪廊、即山亭、凝霞阁、碧光亭、池上草堂、碧梧轩等诸景。
    “四面厅”是该园的主建筑。静坐厅前，可观池塘倩影、陆上景色。厅东有石峰一座，状如古琴横卧，故名“横琴”。
    游轩旱船南依小山，北临清水，舱名“池上草堂”。于此凭栏俯瞰，清清池水、曳风荷莲，尽在眼底。旱船中有明镜一块，将山石、秀木、湖景尽揽其中，与园内景色相映成趣。旱船内挂有明代嘉定文人及现代书画家所作的对联、条幅。
    旱船西边，有福、禄、寿三星石。三星石北接丛桂轩。此轩因处桂花丛中而得名。轩前轩后，左右相邻，遍植桂花，其中有两棵百年老桂，至今依然青枝绿叶，生机盎然。一到桂子飘香季节，置身丛桂轩中，吸吮那浓郁的桂子馨香，使人陶醉不已。轩后是一个用梅花、桂花、天竺、湖石等装点而成的小院，景点虽小，却构成了一个精致的“园中之园”。
    与秋霞圃相邻的城隍庙又是一处古迹，初建于南宋嘉定年间，后屡屡扩建，气势宏伟，风格古朴。每逢清明、七月十五、十月初一，参谒者摩肩接踵。清人钱大昕有诗云：“刺眼繁花细细开，陌头女伴踏歌来。烧香才罢游园去，延缘轩前薄相（戏游）回”。诗中提到的延缘轩是城隍庙后园的又一景。
