A new nuclear medicine method for the early diagnosis of primary liver cancer—99MTC-PMT liver tumor imaging agent—has been applied clinically at Shanghai Medical University's affiliated Zhongshan Hospital. Its diagnostic localization rate reaches 61.6%, and its diagnostic specificity rate reaches 95.8%. The smallest liver cancer detected has a diameter of two centimeters, reaching an advanced global level.

The incidence of primary liver cancer is relatively high in China. Although advanced instruments such as CT and B-ultrasound, as well as alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) testing, are currently available for diagnosis, these methods can only provide localization without specificity, especially for the 20% of liver cancer patients who are AFP-negative, making diagnosis difficult.

Four years ago, the Nuclear Medicine Research Room, Liver Cancer Research Room of Shanghai Medical University's affiliated Zhongshan Hospital, and the Nuclear Pharmacy Research Room of Shanghai Medical University collaborated to synthesize a new radiopharmaceutical for liver cancer, 99MTC-PMT liver tumor imaging agent, and applied it to the imaging of liver cancer patients. Over the past four years, imaging of 308 liver cancer patients has been conducted, with 131 cases confirmed by surgical pathology. Liver cancer tissues have shown a clear ability to concentrate this drug. Therefore, using this new method, the diagnosis of primary liver cancer is highly specific and sensitive, providing a new approach for the localization and specificity diagnosis of small liver cancers that were previously difficult to confirm with conventional methods, the localization and specificity diagnosis of AFP-negative liver cancer, the differential diagnosis of primary and secondary liver cancer, and the diagnosis of metastatic lesions and liver adenomas in primary liver cancer. Additionally, this liver imaging can visually display the size, number, and location of liver cancer, providing a reference for surgery.

The 99MTC-PMT liver tumor imaging agent is non-toxic and safe to use. The examination only requires the drug to be injected intravenously, followed by imaging with a BCT camera to make a diagnosis. The method is simple and painless for the patient.

Currently, only China and Japan have applied this method in clinical diagnosis worldwide.

　　我国早期肝癌诊断达世界先进水平
    上海可检查出直径两厘米肝脏肿瘤
    新华社上海１月４日电  （记者张耀智）一种可早期诊断原发性肝癌的核医学新方法——９９ＭＴＣ—ＰＭＴ肝肿瘤显像剂，已在上海医科大学附属中山医院应用于临床，其诊断定位率达到６１．６％，定性率达到９５．８％，检查出最小的肝癌直径为两厘米，达到了世界先进水平。
    原发性肝癌在我国的发病率较高，虽然目前已有ＣＴ、Ｂ超等先进仪器及甲胎蛋白检查等诊断方法，但诊断只能定位，不能定性，特别是对２０％ＡＦＰ阴性肝癌病人的诊断仍有困难。
    四年前，上海医科大学附属中山医院核医学研究室、肝癌研究室和上海医科大学核药学研究室共同努力，在国内首先合成了新肝癌放射性药物９９ＭＴＣ—ＰＭＴ肝肿瘤显像剂，并用于肝癌病人的显像。四年来，对３０８例肝癌病人的显像，１３１例经手术病理证实，肝癌组织对这种药物有明显的浓聚能力。因此，用这种新方法，诊断原发性肝癌的特异性强，灵敏度高，为过去采用常规方法无法明确的小肝癌病人的定位定性诊断、ＡＦＰ阴性肝癌的定位定性诊断、原发性与继发性肝癌的鉴别诊断、原发性肝癌转移病灶及肝腺瘤的诊断，提供了新的方法。另外，这种肝显像可直观显示出肝癌的大小、数量和部位，为手术提供参考。
    ９９ＭＴＣ—ＰＭＴ肝肿瘤显像剂无毒性，使用安全，检查时只要把药物经静脉注入体内，然后用ＢＣＴ照相机显像即可诊断，方法简单，病人无痛苦。
    目前世界上仅有我国和日本将这种方法应用于临床诊断。
