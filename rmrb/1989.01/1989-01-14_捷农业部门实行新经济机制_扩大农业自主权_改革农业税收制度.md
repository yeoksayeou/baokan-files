Czechoslovakia is fully implementing a new economic mechanism in its agriculture sector starting this year, deepening agricultural reforms.

Recently, the head of the Planning and Economic Mechanism Department of the Czechoslovak Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Food, Ceresnaya, provided a detailed explanation to our reporter about the reform principles that have already been implemented in agriculture.

He said that in recent years, Czechoslovakia's agriculture has achieved significant progress, and last year saw another bumper harvest. The market supply of meat, milk, eggs, and other foodstuffs is abundant, with a food self-sufficiency rate of 98%. However, the main problem in agriculture is high costs and poor production efficiency. The urgent task for agriculture is to further improve food self-sufficiency and production efficiency.

He pointed out that expanding the autonomy of agricultural units, allowing them to operate independently in production and sales, and being financially self-sufficient, is a major reform in agriculture. However, given that agricultural products are related to national and people's livelihoods, the state currently still issues mandatory targets for grain and meat.

Tax reform is another important reform in agriculture. Starting this year, agricultural units will, like other sectors of the national economy, pay 50% of wage funds tax and 50% of profit tax.

Ceresnaya explained that the reform of tax collection and profit rates is the biggest change in economic measures in agriculture. So far, the state has provided agriculture with many subsidies, only collecting 20% of profits from agricultural units, while agricultural units can freely use labor without paying taxes to the state. The collection of these two taxes will encourage agricultural units to save manpower and materials, adopt advanced technologies, and improve production efficiency.

He said that due to the state's increase in agricultural unit taxes, agricultural production costs will rise. To compensate for the increased costs, the state has decided to raise the purchase prices of agricultural products by an average of 20%.

　　捷农业部门实行新经济机制
    扩大农业自主权　改革农业税收制度
    新华社布拉格１月１２日电  （记者刘天白）捷克斯洛伐克从今年起在农业部门全面实行新的经济机制，深化农业改革。
    捷联邦农业和食品部计划和经济机制司司长切列什尼亚最近向本社记者详细介绍了在农业中已开始实施的改革原则。
    他说，近年来捷农业取得很大成就，去年又获丰收。市场上肉、奶、蛋等食品供应充足，食品自给率达９８％。但农业中存在的主要问题是成本高，生产效益欠佳。农业面临的迫切任务是进一步提高食品自给率和生产效益。
    他指出，扩大农业单位的自主权，使它在生产和销售方面自主经营，在财务方面自负盈亏，是农业中的重大改革。但鉴于农产品关系到国计民生，国家目前仍给农业单位下达粮和肉这两项指令性指标。
    税收制度的改革是农业中的又一重要改革。从今年起，农业单位需同国民经济其它部门一样缴纳５０％的工资资金税和５０％的利润税。
    切列什尼亚解释说，税收和利润率的改革是农业中经济手段方面最大的变动。迄今为止，国家一直给予农业很多补贴，仅向农业单位征收２０％的利润，而农业单位可自由使用劳动力，不向国家纳税。增收这两种税，可促使农业单位节约人力物力，采用先进技术，提高生产效益。
    他说，由于国家提高了农业单位的税款，将使农业生产成本提高，为补偿增加的费用，国家决定将农产品的收购价格平均提高２０％。
