Title: Spirit is the Essence of an Article

Reading Mr. Lu Xun's articles, one always feels a fresh and intense flavor, like tasting strong tea or drinking aged wine, making one feel invigorated and satisfied, with a lingering aftertaste!

An article without "flavor" is pitiful. Unique flavor comes from unique spirit. In martial arts, they emphasize "training the body externally and cultivating the spirit internally." The spirit follows the will, and only then can one reach a state of transcendent skill. Writing articles also requires cultivating internal strength and nurturing a literary spirit. Otherwise, one can only produce superficial articles, where the spirit does not follow the will, and the flavor does not come from the heart, merely displaying a fancy facade, pitifully not knowing what to make of it! Han Yu's "vigorous spirit and appropriate words" is well said: when the spirit is full, one can write in any way. Regarding spirit, I understand it as a mixture of the author's temperament, cultivation, thoughts, and emotions, seemingly belonging to the realm of innate qualities. A spirit that is slow and subtle is suitable for composing grand works; a spirit that is bold and urgent is skilled in crafting short pieces; a spirit that is smooth and gentle, clear and bright, is good at handling delicate words, soft and charming; a spirit that is heroic and turbulent, likes to write miscellaneous essays, fully expressing masculinity...

An article is a manifestation of spirit. Only when the author imbues the article with spirit can the reader sense a certain rhythm, and only then can they detect a flavor. If an article lacks spirit, it is like an eye without a pupil, like a pearl without luster. Spirit is the fusion of form and meaning, although it belongs to internal strength, it relies on external language and characters to manifest. A single phrase can be timelessly new, but the art of using it lies in the heart: short sentences are like marching swiftly with a bite in the mouth, hurried and urgent; long sentences are like a celestial horse galloping freely, leaping and bounding—expressing resentment requires brevity, expressing emotions requires length; colloquial language has its own charm, classical language has its own spirit—it should be both harmonious and dignified...

To achieve the effect of "words ending but spirit endless," one must make the sentences follow the will, and the spirit follow the sentences, creating a natural flow like clouds and water, freely like a stream. Spirit's power is unpredictable and magical. "Not in the words, not separate from the words," precisely describes how spirit relies on words to manifest but also transcends them.

Miscellaneous essays are a genre of righteous spirit—expressing righteousness and suppressing evil. If a miscellaneous essay, after reading, does not release the righteous spirit in one's heart (making one clap hands and stomp feet, exclaiming "exciting, exciting") and does not suppress a full belly of evil spirit (making one's hair stand on end, pounding the table and standing up), then this article should not be mixed in with miscellaneous essays, and "good" is even more out of the question.

Those who play Go understand the importance of "spirit." To survive, one must first create an "eye," having an eye means having spirit, and having spirit means the game is alive. The logic of writing is similar to the logic of Go—"literary spirit" comes from the "eye of the article." The eye of the article is the essence of the article. Its content is profound thoughts, and its form is new and beautiful sentences. Both refining sentences and tempering thoughts, creating two eyes in three days, two eyes breathing out a spirit, continuing this way, "spirit" and "flavor" will match, and if the written article lacks flavor, that would truly be strange!

　　气是文章主
    李建永
    读鲁迅先生的文章，总觉着一股鲜异的烈味儿逼人，如品酽茗，如饮陈醪，读来使人酣畅淋漓，且回甘绵绵于无尽！
    无“味”的文章是悲哀的。独家之味，源于独家之气。武林中讲究“外练筋骨皮，内练一口气”，气随意行，方可到达出神入化的境地。写文章亦需要练一身内功，修一种文气。否则，就只能作出些皮毛文章，气不随意，味不从心，徒摆一副花架子，可怜兮兮不知当算甚的玩艺儿！韩愈的“气盛言宜”说得好：气足了，怎样写都行。对气，我理解它是作者自身的气质、修养、思想、情绪的混和物，似乎属于秉赋的范畴。气缓而绵密者，宜于构制宏篇；气壮而急促者，工于精制短章；气舒柔而晴朗，善弄纤词，阴柔妩媚；气豪烈而逆浊，喜作杂感，极尽阳刚……
    文成一口气。只有作者赋予文章以气，读者才能体味到一种气韵，才能嗅出一股味儿来。文若无气，犹眼之无珠，犹珠之无神。气是形意融和之物，虽属内功，但要依靠外在的语言文字来体现。一语天然万古新，然而，运用之妙，却存乎一心：短句如衔枚疾走，行色匆匆，长句似天马行空，奔突驰骋——泄愤就短，抒情宜长；俗语占尽俗语的风流，文言自有文言之精神——宜谐宜庄……使其长短错落，雅俗相间，天然如行云，自在若流水，句随意走，气从句行，必将产生言有尽而“气”无穷的奇效！气的力量是无常而神妙的。“不在文字，不离文字”，正好来说明气虽借文字以行，却又远远超越于文字之外。
    杂文是浩气的文体——抒正气而压邪气。如果一篇杂文读后，既没有抒放了胸中之正气（使人搓手跺脚，连呼痛快、痛快），也没有憋足满肚子恶气（令人怒发冲冠，拍案而起），那么，这文章就不该混迹杂文之列，“好”就更谈不上了。
    下围棋的人，最知道“气”的要命。为求生存，必先做“眼”，有眼就有气，有气棋就活了。文理与棋理颇相类似——“文气”从“文眼”来。文眼是文章之精髓所在。它的内容是精深的思想，形式是新美的句式。既锤炼句式，又淬砺思想，三天做它两个眼，两眼长出一口气，长之以往，“气”“味”相投，写出来的文章没味儿那才真叫个怪哩！
