In the depths of winter, this reporter braved the snow to visit Gongxian County's Bamboo Grove Village, a leading unit in the construction of "two civilizations" in Henan Province, to analyze the reasons behind the village's transformation from poverty to prosperity and from chaos to order. The village party branch secretary said that in the new historical period, the party's work in rural areas cannot rely on the "philosophy of struggle" or the idea that "money can do everything." The key is for Communist Party members to set an example by serving the people wholeheartedly, leveraging the party's political advantages to promote the construction of both material and spiritual civilizations.

Bamboo Grove Village has six party branches under its jurisdiction, with 74 party members. The village is characterized by high mountains and thin soil, and has long been impoverished. It was not until 1980 that the per capita net income reached 87 yuan. The village's customs were also not upright, with several villagers sent to labor camps for criminal offenses, and some party members and cadres neglecting their party work to pursue personal wealth, leading to a semi-paralyzed state of the party organization. In June 1983, the village party branch convened a full membership meeting and decided that party members who only pursued personal wealth without doing party work could no longer hold office. Those who were willing to lead the village to prosperity would be appointed as cadres. Through elections, Zhao Ming'en, who joined the party in 1965, was appointed as the party branch secretary. He had technical skills and was good at management, but he declined high-paying job offers from other places. Upon taking office, he immediately set up two factories. Since then, in addition to increasing agricultural production every year, Bamboo Grove has utilized local resource advantages to establish a refractory brick factory, a chemical plant, and a small coal mine. Now, there are 19 factories and mines in the village, with fixed assets totaling 17.2 million yuan. Last year, the village achieved a production value of 21 million yuan, paid 840,000 yuan in taxes to the state, and the per capita net income reached 1,250 yuan. Most villagers have built new houses. Over the past six years, the village has not had a single criminal case, and gambling, theft, fighting, and feudal superstitions have disappeared, as have cases of overpopulation and early marriage. 180 villagers have submitted applications to join the party.

The party members of Bamboo Grove believe that whether a party member sets an example depends on their attitude towards making money and labor. The township government stipulates that based on the village's completion of production value and tax revenue, the salaries of village cadres will be determined. According to the regulations, village party branch secretary Zhao Ming'en and village head Li Shuquan could each earn 530 yuan per month last year, but they took only 200 yuan and 150 yuan respectively, and other party members and cadres holding positions such as branch secretaries and factory managers also took less salary accordingly. Despite earning less, they took the lead in doing hard and dangerous work. Once, when the refractory brick factory was due to produce bricks, there was a sudden power outage, making it impossible to ventilate and cool down. According to the contract, the bricks had to be delivered to the buyer on time. Zhao Ming'en wrapped himself in a wet old quilt, put old shoes on his hands, and rushed into the kiln to take out the bricks, burning his hair and eyebrows and blistering his face. Following his example, the villagers also rushed into the kiln to ensure timely delivery of the bricks, and the ropes tying the bricks on the cart were even burned by the fire. When the coal mine encountered a dangerous situation, a huge rock was about to fall. The party branch secretary of the mine, Li Quanxiang, first pushed away the out-of-town miners and then the local miners, risking his life to remove the danger. Party members and cadres also insist on volunteering to work one day a month, repairing roads, fixing houses, cleaning up, and so on, without taking any pay for this day. With party members setting an example, the party organization has gained authority. When the coal mine collapsed and urgently needed wood, and when the road construction lacked stones, the party branch and the village committee issued a call, and the villagers rushed to deliver the materials. When a village meeting of 1,500 people was convened, everyone could arrive within half an hour after being notified.

To place party members and cadres under the supervision of the entire village, Bamboo Grove insists on carrying out the "mass evaluation of party members, party members evaluation of branches" activity, holding a meeting on the ninth of every month, with the content closely related to reality, from taking advantage of public property to not respecting parents, all can be raised at the life meeting, and decisions are made on the spot. Once, a party member took a small advantage from public property, and the masses raised the issue at the meeting. He felt very aggrieved, reasoning that some masses also took advantages. Several party members asked him, "Is it the masses learning from party members, or party members learning from the masses?" He understood and immediately made a self-criticism and accepted the fine.

Recently, leaders from the central government and Henan Province visited Bamboo Grove to inspect work, praising their approach of leveraging the party's political advantages to promote the construction of two civilizations. The Organization Department of the Central Committee is also summarizing and promoting their experiences.

　　踏雪访“竹林”
    本报记者  李德民
    隆冬时节，记者踏雪采访河南省“两个文明建设”先进单位巩县竹林村，分析这个村由穷变富、由乱变治的原因。村党总支的同志说，在新的历史时期，党在农村开展工作，靠“斗争哲学”不行，靠“金钱万能”也不行，关键要靠共产党员全心全意为人民服务的模范行动，去发挥党的政治优势，促进两个文明建设。
    竹林村党总支下属６个党支部，有７４名党员。这个村山高土薄，长期贫困，直到１９８０年，人均纯收入才８７元，风气也不正，有几名村民因违法犯罪被劳动教养，有些党员和干部只顾个人发财，放弃党的工作，党组织处于半瘫痪状态。１９８３年６月，村党总支召开全体党员大会，决定：凡是只顾个人发财不做党的工作的党员，不能再当干部，谁愿意带领全村致富，谁当干部。经过选举，１９６５年入党的赵明恩担任党总支书记，他有技术，善管理，但他谢绝外地高薪聘请，一上任就办起两个工厂。从此以后，竹林除了农业连年增产，还利用本地资源优势，办起耐火砖厂、化工厂、小煤窑，现在共有１９个厂矿，村里的固定资产达１７２０万元，去年实现产值２１００万元，上缴国家税金８４万元，人均纯收入达１２５０元，大多数村民盖起了新房。全村６年来没有发生一起刑事案件，赌博、偷摸、打架斗殴、封建迷信活动绝迹，也没有超生早育现象，１８０名村民递交了入党申请书。
    竹林的党员们认为，看一个党员是不是起模范作用，要看他对待发财和劳动的态度。乡政府规定，根据村里完成产值、利税的多少，评定村干部的工资。按规定，村党总支书记赵明恩和村长李淑转去年每月可以领５３０元工资，可是他们一个领２００元，一个领１５０元，其他担任支部书记、厂长的党员、干部也相应少领了工资。钱少领，苦活、险活却要干在前面。有一次耐火砖厂该出砖时，突然停电，没法鼓风散热，根据合同又必须按时给买主送砖，赵明恩身披打湿水的旧棉被，手上套着旧鞋，扑进窑膛出砖，烤焦了头发眉毛，脸上烫起水泡。在他的带动下，群众也跟进窑膛，保证按时送砖，砖在大车上把捆砖的草绳都烤着火了。煤矿出现险情，一块巨石摇摇欲坠，矿党支部书记李全章先推开外地的矿工，又推开本村的矿工，冒死排险。党员、干部还坚持每月义务劳动一天的制度，补路、修房、打扫卫生，等等，这一天分文不取。党员有了模范作用，党组织就有了威信。煤矿塌方，急需木料，修路石子不够，党总支和村委会一声号召，村民争先恐后送到。召开１５００人的村民大会，一下通知，半小时可以到齐。
    为了使党员、干部置于全村群众监督之下，竹林坚持开展“群众评党员、党员评支部”活动，每月逢“９”开会，内容联系实际，从占公家的便宜到不孝敬父母，生活会上都可以提，而且当场作出处理。有位党员占了公家一点小便宜，群众在会上当面提出，他感到很委屈，理由是有些群众也占了便宜。几位党员问他：“是群众学党员，还是党员学群众？”他思想通了，当场作检查，接受罚款。
    最近中央和河南省的领导同志到竹林检查工作，表扬了他们发挥党的政治优势，促进两个文明建设的做法，中组部也在总结、推广他们的经验。
