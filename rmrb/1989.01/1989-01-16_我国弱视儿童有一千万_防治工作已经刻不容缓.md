Researchers from Zhejiang Medical University recently conducted a study indicating that at least 10 million children in China suffer from amblyopia, with an incidence rate as high as 3%. The prevention and treatment of amblyopia in children is now urgent.

It is understood that amblyopia is a serious eye condition in children, often accompanied by strabismus and refractive errors. It leads to reduced vision in children, loss of stereoscopic vision, and an inability to engage in many professions such as aviation and instrument operation as they grow older. Severe cases can result in disability. Since the treatment of amblyopia is closely related to age, it is generally not curable after the age of 16. Therefore, it is crucial to actively treat amblyopia during childhood.

Experts believe that the increase in the number of children with amblyopia in China is due to many parents and teachers confusing reduced vision in children with myopia. Once they notice a child's vision declining, they rush to get glasses, neglecting the condition of amblyopia.

Experts suggest that currently, it is necessary to establish comprehensive eye disease screenings for preschool children, primary school students, and middle school students. If a condition is discovered, it should be treated promptly and not just limited to vision checks.

　　我国弱视儿童有一千万
    防治工作已经刻不容缓
    新华社杭州１月１５日电  （实习生慎海雄）浙江医科大学科研人员最近的一项研究表明，我国弱视儿童患者至少有１０００万，发病率高达３％。儿童弱视的防治工作已经刻不容缓。
    据了解，弱视是对儿童危害极大的眼病，常伴有斜视、屈光等症状。它导致儿童视力下降，失去立体感觉，长大以后不能从事航行、仪表仪器等许多工作，严重的可以致残。由于弱视患者的治疗与年龄有很大关系，超过１６岁一般就不能治愈，因此必须在儿童时期积极治疗。
    专家认为，造成我国弱视儿童增多的原因，在于许多家长和教师把儿童视力下降和近视混为一谈，一旦看到孩子视力下降就忙于配眼镜，忽视了弱视这一眼病。
    专家建议，当前要健全学龄前儿童、小学生和中学生的眼病普查，发现病情要及时治疗，不能单纯检查视力。
