The international community has reacted strongly to the U.S.-Libya conflict.

	● Britain does not endorse the attack but accepts the U.S. "self-defense" explanation
	● France and Italy adopt cautious attitudes, calling for restraint from both sides
	● Arab League Secretary-General condemns U.S. actions

	BEIJING, Jan. 5 (Xinhua) — British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said today in a television interview that she does not endorse the choice of military strikes.

	However, it was reported that a spokesman for the British Foreign Office stated last night that the British government accepts the U.S. explanation that the shooting down of two Libyan fighter jets was an act of "self-defense," and that it has "independent evidence" to support the U.S. accusations that Libya is developing chemical weapons.

	PARIS, Jan. 5 (Xinhua) — French Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Roland Dumas said that France hopes the aircraft incident between the U.S. and Libya will not escalate tensions in the Mediterranean.

	Dumas expressed this stance at a press conference held yesterday afternoon at the Foreign Ministry. He also said that it is too early to discuss the specifics of the incident, and that France will closely monitor the potential consequences of the developments.

	Today's Paris newspapers commented that the U.S. actions have made its allies "angry," and that France has adopted a "very reserved and cautious attitude."

	ROME, Jan. 5 (Xinhua) — Regarding the incident on January 4 where the U.S. Sixth Fleet shot down two Libyan MiG-23 fighter jets in the Mediterranean, the Italian government expressed concern over the further deterioration of the situation in the Mediterranean.

	The Italian Foreign Ministry issued a statement last night pointing out that the incident is very serious and called on both sides to adopt a "restrained" attitude.

	The Italian Socialist Party's official newspaper, "Avanti!," stated that the claim that the U.S. fleet was under threat of attack is not "convincing." It said, "The Mediterranean is already a region with many conflicts, and new conflicts must not be allowed to arise."

	BEIJING, Jan. 5 (Xinhua) — According to our correspondent in the Middle East, Arab League Secretary-General Chedli Klibi said yesterday that the U.S. shooting down of two Libyan aircraft in the Mediterranean is a "very serious act of aggression."

	Klibi, in a statement issued in Tunis, demanded that the U.S. stop escalating the conflict with Libya and cease provocations in Libyan waters.

    本报巴黎１月５日电　记者张启华报道：法国外交国务部长罗朗·迪马说，法国希望美国和利比亚发生的飞机事件不要加剧地中海的紧张局势。
    迪马部长是昨天下午在外交部举行的记者招待会上回答问题时表示这一立场的。他还说，现在来谈事件的具体情况还为时过早，法国将密切注视事态发展可能带来的后果。
    今天巴黎的报纸评论说，美国的言行令它的盟国“恼怒”，法国采取了“非常保留的谨慎态度”。
    本报罗马１月５日电　记者史克栋报道：对于１月４日美国第六舰队在地中海击落两架利比亚米格—２３战斗机事件，意大利政府表示对地中海形势进一步紧张感到“担心”。
