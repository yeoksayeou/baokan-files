	China's foreign economic aid has entered a new phase. Since 1979, over the course of a decade, China has adhered to the principles of seeking truth from facts and acting within its capabilities. It has rationally adjusted the scale, layout, and structure of its economic and technological aid, focusing on consolidating the results of completed projects. Now, more than 80 countries have received aid from China. China's foreign aid efforts have made new contributions to helping friendly developing countries develop their national economies and have played an active role in international affairs.

	The new phase of China's foreign aid work over the past decade is mainly reflected in four aspects:

	First, overall planning and rational adjustment of the scale, layout, and structure of foreign aid, providing more countries with aid within our capabilities. With the development of China's foreign relations, while continuing to provide aid to 64 old recipient countries, aid has also been provided to 24 new recipient countries. Additionally, aid to the least developed countries has been strengthened. From 1984 to 1988, the amount of aid and actual disbursements to 34 least developed countries increased by 63% and 46% respectively compared to the period from 1979 to 1983. At the same time, the aid structure has been adjusted, increasing the proportion of comprehensive projects and technical and intellectual aid. Over the decade, this aspect of aid expenditure accounted for 74% of the total economic and technological aid expenditure, double the proportion of the previous eight years in the 1970s.

	Second, actively exploring new cooperation methods, making aid methods flexible and diverse, adapting to the different situations and needs of various countries. In recent years, while continuing traditional aid methods, we have combined bilateral aid with multilateral aid through United Nations agencies, with both parties jointly funding and China sending experts to implement the projects; combined aid with contracting engineering projects, helping recipient countries implement certain development projects; and after the completion of overseas comprehensive projects, developed from purely technical cooperation to Chinese experts participating in management and operations.

	Third, a number of projects with good effects and significant influence have been established. Over the decade, China has helped 67 countries complete 335 comprehensive projects. Among them, some large and medium-sized projects have shown significant economic and social benefits. A number of small-scale projects with low investment and quick results have also achieved good benefits.

	Fourth, helping recipient countries manage enterprises well and consolidating the construction results of a number of projects. In the 1960s and 1970s, China helped developing countries complete a large number of comprehensive projects. Many of these productive projects played their due economic role. However, after Chinese experts left, due to various reasons such as the lack of management talents and poor management in the recipient countries, some enterprises did not operate normally, economic benefits declined, and some were in long-term losses. Since 1982, we have summarized the experiences and lessons of many years, placing the work of consolidating project results on an equal footing with the construction of new projects. We have carried out various forms of technical cooperation and management cooperation for 275 completed projects, enabling many projects to achieve good economic and social benefits. Some projects have quickly turned losses into profits and regained vitality.

　　我国对外经济援助出现新局面
    本报讯  从１９７９年以来的１０年中，我国本着实事求是、量力而行的原则，合理调整对外经济技术援助的规模、布局和结构，着力巩固建成项目成果。现在，接受我国援助的国家达８０多个。我国的对外援助工作为帮助第三世界友好国家发展民族经济作出了新的贡献，在国际事务中发挥了积极作用。
    １０年来，我国对外援助工作开创的新局面主要体现在四个方面：
    一，统筹安排，合理调整对外援助的规模、布局和结构，向更多的国家提供了力所能及的援助。随着我国对外关系的发展，在向６４个老的受援国继续提供援助的同时，又向２４个新的受援国提供了援助；并进一步加强了对最不发达国家的援助。１９８４年至１９８８年，向３４个最不发达国家新提供的援款和实际交付额，比１９７９年至１９８３年分别增加了６３％和４６％。同时，调整了援助结构，提高了成套项目和技术、智力援助的比重。１０年中，这方面的援助支出占整个经济技术援助总支出的７４％，比７０年代前８年的比重提高了一倍。
    二，积极探索新的合作方式，使援助方式灵活多样，适应不同国家的情况和需要。几年来，在继续搞好传统方式援助的同时，采取了双边援助同联合国机构的多边援助相结合，双方共同出资，由我国派专家组织实施；援助同开展承包工程相结合，帮助受援国实施某些发展项目；援外成套项目建成后，由过去单纯的技术合作发展为我专家参与经营管理。
    三，建立了一批效果好、影响大的项目。１０年中，我国先后帮助６７个国家建成３３５个成套项目。其中有些大中型项目经济和社会效益显著。一批投资少、见效快的小型项目也获得了良好效益。
    四，帮助受援国管好企业，巩固了一批项目的建设成果。６０年代和７０年代，我国帮助第三世界国家建成了一大批成套项目。其中许多生产性项目发挥了应有的经济效益。但是，中国专家离开后，由于受援国缺乏管理人才和经营管理不善等多方面的原因，以致有些企业生产不正常，经济效益下降，有的长期亏损。１９８２年以后，我们总结了多年来的经验教训，把巩固项目成果的工作摆在同援建新项目同等重要的位置，对２７５个建成项目进行了多种形式的技术合作和管理合作，使许多项目发挥了较好的经济和社会效益。有些项目迅速扭亏为盈，恢复了生机。
