Nine years ago, the cries for help at Beijing's Longtan Lake shocked the entire society.

On December 8, 1979, when a middle school student accidentally fell into Longtan Lake and called for help loudly, hundreds of people watched, but no one extended a helping hand. When four officers and soldiers from the Meteorological Service Station of the Beijing Military Region heard the news and rushed to the scene to break the ice and rescue the person, some people even sneered, saying, "The soldiers' time to win merits has come." In response, this newspaper and some news organizations in the capital successively published news and comments, calling for "improving social ethics."

Time has passed, and nine years have gone by. The "Longtan Lake phenomenon" that once shocked society has reappeared in an astonishing way—

On November 1, 1988, just 200 meters away from the scene of the Longtan Lake rescue nine years ago, it was again the soldiers of the Meteorological Service Station who stepped forward and, amidst the indifference of the crowd, rescued a woman who attempted to take her own life.

That afternoon, just after two o'clock, volunteer soldier Fang Fengqian of the Meteorological Service Station was on his way to the duty station on his bicycle. A passerby told him, "Hurry up, someone has jumped into the moat, please help the soldier to save him!" At that time, dozens of people were watching by the river. They saw a woman in a thick coat struggling in the middle of the river, but no one went into the water to help. Although Fang, whose swimming skills were not very good, did not say a word, he took off his military uniform, waded through the knee-deep mud of the riverbed, and swam towards the center of the river. He rescued the woman, who was already unconscious and shivering all over, and brought her ashore. At this time, the crowd's gazes were mostly indifferent, and some even sneered. A few people even made a few sarcastic remarks. Fang, ignoring all this, asked a young man riding a tricycle for help to send the woman he had just rescued to a nearby military hospital for treatment. However, this simple request to save a life was rejected by the young man. Finally, it was the local police who arrived in time and sent the drowning woman to the hospital for emergency treatment, saving her life.

A few days later, when the leaders of the unit where the drowning woman worked came to express their thanks, it was only then that the army learned of Fang's selfless rescue. His superiors awarded him a third-class merit citation. Fang, who had never been awarded a merit citation in his eight years of service, felt very uncomfortable after receiving the third-class merit citation and even did not want to accept this honor.

Recently, the reporter interviewed this respectable soldier. He did not want to talk about his own deeds and rarely talked about his growth process under the army's education, but he raised a series of thought-provoking questions—

"Why don't I want this kind of honor? If I were to win a merit citation on the front lines of Laoshan, I would be overjoyed, but now it is in a situation where others should win the merit citation that I win it, especially under the cold eyes and ridicule of some people, it really makes me angry."

"What if I had not passed by Longtan Lake at that time, and there were no other soldiers on the scene, would the onlookers really bear to see the drowning person drown to death?"

"How has the spiritual civilization construction been in recent years? It should be said that there have been great achievements. However, after nine years, why has the 'Longtan Lake phenomenon' reappeared?"

"Now, when some people talk about bad social ethics, they are both indignant and sigh, why don't they want to practice what they preach and start with themselves?"

Soldier Fang Fengqian hopes that all sectors of society will think about these questions.

　　救人后的问号
    本报记者  吴学林  陈维伟
    ９年前，北京龙潭湖的呼救声曾引起整个社会的震动。
    １９７９年１２月８日，面对一名中学生不慎掉进龙潭湖中的大声呼救，上百人围观，却没有伸出一只救援之手。当北空司令部气象勤务站４名干部、战士闻讯赶到破冰救人的时候，有人竟冷嘲热讽，说“大兵立功的时候到了”。对此，本报和首都一些新闻单位相继发表消息和评论，呼唤“整顿社会风气”。
    岁月流逝，９年过去了，当年震动社会的“龙潭湖现象”又惊人地重现——
    １９８８年１１月１日，距９年前龙潭湖救人处２００米远的护城河畔，还是气象勤务站的战士，再次挺身而出，在众人袖手旁观下，救起一位欲寻短见的妇女。
    这天下午两点刚过，准备前往部队值班的气象勤务站志愿兵方风前，骑车路过龙潭湖，一名路人对他说：“赶快，有人跳护城河了，请解放军帮忙救一下！”当时，河边数十人围观，只见一名穿棉大衣的妇女在河中心挣扎，却无一人下水搭救。游泳技术并不十分强的小方二话没说，脱下军衣，趟过足有没膝深淤泥的河床，游向河中心，将那位早已神志不清、周身冻得直打哆嗦的妇女抢救上岸。此时，旁观的人群投来的目光，有敬佩的，但更多的是麻木不仁的，自然也有嘲讽的，个别人甚至还甩出一两句风凉话。小方不顾这些，向一位蹬三轮车的小伙子求助，帮忙送刚刚救上岸来的妇女到附近自己部队救护。然而，就这么一个救人如救火的要求，竟遭到那个小伙子的拒绝。最后，还是当地派出所干警赶来，及时将落水妇女送医院抢救，才使她最终脱离危险。
    几天后，落水妇女所在单位领导登门感谢时，小方舍己救人的事迹才被部队得知，上级给他记三等功一次。入伍８年来从未立功的方风前在荣立三等功之后，心里反而很不是滋味，甚至不想接受这一荣誉。
    记者最近采访了这位可敬的战士，他不愿谈自己的事迹，也很少谈在部队教育下成长的过程，却提了一连串发人深思的问题——
    “为什么不想得这种荣誉呢？如果在老山前线立功受奖，我会兴高采烈，但是现在是在本来该别人立功的情况下我去立功，特别是在一些人的冷眼和嘲笑下立功的，心里实在窝火。”
    “假如我当时不在龙潭湖路过，也没有其他军人在场，难道围观者就忍心眼见落水者活活淹死吗？”
    “精神文明建设这几年到底搞得怎样？应该说是有很大成绩。但是，时过９年，为什么‘龙潭湖现象’又重新出现呢？”
    “现在有些人谈起社会不良风气，又是气愤，又是叹息，为什么他们却不肯身体力行，从自己做起呢？”
    战士方风前期望社会各方思考这些问题。
