The Jinan Diesel Engine Factory emits a large amount of poisonous smoke and dust. People feel a sore and itchy throat, dizziness, and nausea upon inhaling it. When the atmospheric pressure is low, the poisonous smoke around the factory does not disperse for a long time, constantly bothering the residents. Residents, government office buildings, and offices along the street dare not open their doors and windows; in the summer, people cannot go out to cool off; many trees near the factory have also withered.

It is suggested that the relevant departments stop the poisonous smoke from spreading indiscriminately.

　　毒烟造成的公害
    济南柴油机厂排放大量有毒烟尘，人一闻到就感到喉头痛痒、头晕恶心。气压低时，这个厂周围的毒烟长时间不散，终日困扰居民。临街的居民住宅、机关宿舍和办公室不敢开门窗；夏日里人们无法上街乘凉；靠近这个厂的不少树木也已枯萎了。
    建议有关部门制止有毒烟尘任意蔓延。
