	Aspiration
	Photography by Huang Chengjiang, Poetry by Hai Lei

	A long, lingering plea rolls on,
	Ripping through the remnants of winter and the sighs within the lungs,
	Like raindrops of thunder.
	Reaching out to distant memories,
	The land stirs with a faint awakening,
	Shaking your numb body,
	Taking steps seemingly forgotten.
	Sunlight, like a frail star, hides in
	Every pore steaming with sweat, waiting,
	For the fading colors to fill the depths of your pupils.
	Days are thus set ablaze by your masculine blood.
	Perhaps the snow will once again quietly approach,
	Shattering your spiral thoughts,
	Leaving you bare like a tree trunk, withering,
	Becoming a wound that aches constantly.
	Silence resonates within your horns,
	Clinging to the hand of the nameless,
	Thread by thread, blooming green across the sky.

### 企望

　　企　望
    黄成江摄影　海雷配诗
    长长的一声乞求　滚动着
    撕开残存的冬季和肺腑里的
    哀叹　像滴落的雷
    伸向遥远的回忆
    有土地微微醒来的响动
    震颤你麻木的躯体
    迈出似乎忘却的步子
    阳光犹如瘦弱的星星　隐匿在
    每个蒸发热气的汗孔　等待
    消逝的颜色充满瞳仁深处
    日子就这样被你雄性的血烧红
    或许风雪再次悄悄摸近
    将你螺旋的思索切碎
    与赤裸的树干一同枯死
    成为时时作痛的伤疤
    沉寂在你双角里奏鸣
    攀着那棵无名者的手掌
    缕缕丝丝　在天际绿绿的开遍
