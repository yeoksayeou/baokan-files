Dear Editor,

A worker in our unit, Zheng, had previously suffered from mental illness. After treatment and discharge, he returned to work normally. Last April, his mental illness suddenly relapsed. We did not have time to send him to the hospital for treatment, nor did we notify his family to take protective measures. After causing trouble in the unit for seven days, Zheng left his residence, where he lived alone, and committed a murder. Now, the court has designated our unit as Zheng's guardian, requiring us to bear his civil liability. I would like to ask if the court's handling of this case violates the order of guardianship? Who should bear the civil liability for this case?

Yours sincerely,

Wang Chao,

The first paragraph of Article 17 of the General Principles of Civil Law stipulates: "A mentally ill person who lacks or has limited civil capacity shall have a guardian as follows: (1) spouse; (2) parents; (3) adult children; (4) other close relatives; (5) other relatives or friends who have close relationships..." When the people's court designates a guardian, it can treat the above five items as the order of designation. If a person in the preceding order has the qualification to be a guardian but lacks the capacity to be a guardian or is clearly detrimental to the ward, the people's court can, according to the principle of what is beneficial to the ward, select the best from the persons in the following order who have the qualification to be a guardian. The law also stipulates that only when there is no guardian as mentioned above, the unit where the mentally ill person is located shall act as the guardian. Therefore, if Zheng has no spouse, his parents are the legal guardians during the period of his mental illness relapse. If Zheng's parents are indeed incapable of guardianship, then a guardian should be selected in accordance with the order of guardianship. The court's designation of your unit as Zheng's guardian violates the order of guardianship and lacks legal basis. Your unit can request the people's court to change it in accordance with the law.

Article 133 of the General Principles of Civil Law stipulates: "A person who lacks or has limited civil capacity and causes damage to others shall be liable for civil damages by the guardian. If the guardian has fulfilled the duty of guardianship, his civil liability may be appropriately reduced." "A person who lacks or has limited civil capacity and has property shall compensate for the damage caused to others from his own property. If the property is insufficient, the guardian shall appropriately compensate." When the ward causes damage to others, if there is a clear guardian, the guardian shall bear the civil liability. If Zheng is found to have committed the murder during a period of mental illness, then his parents should bear the civil liability; when compensating for the damage to others, the compensation should first be paid from Zheng's property, and if the property is insufficient, his parents should appropriately compensate.

Given the special circumstances of this case, Zheng and his parents do not live together, and when Zheng fell ill, his unit did not notify his parents, making it impossible for the guardian to fulfill his duties. Therefore, the civil liability of the guardian can be appropriately reduced.

When Zheng fell ill, your unit neither notified his parents to take care of him nor sent him to the hospital for treatment in time, resulting in his leaving his residence on the eighth day and committing the murder, turning a potentially avoidable serious incident into reality. Your unit is at fault. We believe that in handling the case, the spirit of Article 160 of the "Opinions of the Supreme People's Court on Several Issues Concerning the Implementation of the General Principles of Civil Law," which states, "If a mentally ill person in a psychiatric hospital is injured or causes damage to others, and the unit is at fault, the unit can be ordered to appropriately compensate," can be followed, and your unit should compensate for part of the damage to the victim.

### 这一案件的民事责任由谁承担？

　　这一案件的民事责任由谁承担？
    编辑同志
    我单位职工郑某以前曾患过精神病，经治疗出院后正常上班。去年４月，郑某精神病突然复发。我们没有来得及送他去医院治疗，也未通知他的家属采取监护措施。郑某在单位闹腾７天之后，从只有他一个人居住的住所出走，发生了杀人事件。现在，法院指定我单位是郑某的监护人，要求承担其民事责任。请问法院这样处理违反监护顺序吗？谁应承担这件案子的民事责任？
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　山东枣庄　王超王超同志：
    民法通则第１７条第１款规定：“无民事行为能力或者限制民事行为能力的精神病人，由下列人员担任监护人：（一）配偶；（二）父母；（三）成年子女；（四）其他近亲属；（五）关系密切的其他亲属、朋友……”。人民法院指定监护人时，可以将上述五项规定视为指定监护人的顺序。前一顺序有监护资格的人无监护能力或者对被监护人明显不利的，人民法院可以根据对被监护人有利的原则从后一顺序有监护资格的人中择优确定。法律还规定，只有在没有上述监护人的情况下，精神病人的所在单位才担任监护人。据此，如果郑某没有配偶，父母就是其精神病复发期间的法定监护人。如果郑某的父母确无监护能力，则应按监护顺序择优确定监护人。法院指定你单位作郑某的监护人是违反监护顺序的，是没有法律依据的，你单位可请求人民法院依法变更。
    民法通则第１３３条规定：“无民事行为能力人、限制民事行为能力人造成他人损害的，由监护人承担民事责任。监护人尽了监护责任的，可以适当减轻他的民事责任。”“有财产的无民事行为能力人、限制民事行为能力人造成他人损害的，从本人财产中支付赔偿费用。不足部分，由监护人适当赔偿”。被监护人造成他人损害的，有明确的监护人时，由监护人承担民事责任。郑某杀人，如果经鉴定确在犯精神病期间所为，那么，他的父母应承担民事责任；赔偿他人损失时，先从郑某财产中支付，不足部分再由其父母适当偿付。
    鉴于本案的特殊情况，郑某与父母不住在一处，郑某犯病时，他所在单位又未通知其父母，使监护人无法尽监护职责，因此，可以适当减轻监护人的民事责任。
    郑某在犯病时，你单位既不及时通知他父母看护，又不及时送他到医院治疗，以致造成他第８天从住所出走杀人，使一起本来可能避免的恶性事件发生，你单位是有过错的。我们认为，处理时可以比照最高人民法院关于贯彻执行民法通则若干问题的《意见》第１６０条，“在精神病院治疗的精神病人，受到伤害或者给他人造成损害，单位有过错的，可以责令这些单位适当给予赔偿”的规定精神，由你单位赔偿受害人部分损失。
