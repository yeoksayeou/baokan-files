Rats in the Anshan Steel Oxygen Plant's Substation Affect Production
The "Rat King" Dan Chengyi Publicly Eliminates the Rodent Problem

The director of the Shenyang Military Region Air Force New Type Rat Poison Factory, Dan Chengyi, has enthusiastically assisted Anshan Steel in rat control, wholeheartedly serving the people by eliminating pests.

Recently, rats invaded the high-voltage room of the No. 21 air compressor station substation at Anshan Steel's Oxygen Plant, causing a busbar switch to short circuit. This incident affected the production of the iron smelting plant and the seamless tube plant. After the incident, monitoring revealed a high rat density, making it likely that similar incidents could occur at any time. The company's health and hygiene committee convened a meeting with relevant personnel to discuss various rat control methods, but all were deemed to affect power supply and could not be implemented. Therefore, they sent someone to seek help from Dan Chengyi, the director of the Shenyang Military Region Air Force New Type Rat Poison Factory. Known as the "Rat King," Dan Chengyi immediately dropped his work and rushed to the substation. He inspected the rat situation, set up a monitoring mechanism, and placed fast-acting bait. The rats were eliminated that very night. After three days and nights of scientific monitoring, rat tracks disappeared, ensuring safe and reliable power supply. The Anshan City Health and Hygiene Committee held a meeting for the city's rat control personnel on-site, allowing everyone to witness Dan Chengyi lure rats out of their holes during the day, eagerly consume the poison bait, and die en masse before everyone's eyes.

　　鞍钢氧气厂一变电所钻进老鼠影响生产
    灭鼠大王单承仪当众制服鼠患
    新华社沈阳１月１２日电  （通讯员王先贵）沈阳军区空军新型鼠药厂负责人单承仪热心帮助鞍钢灭鼠，全心全意为民除害。
    不久前，鞍钢氧气厂２１号空压站变电所老鼠窜入高压室，造成母线开关短路，致使炼铁厂和无缝厂生产受到影响。事发后，经监测鼠密度很高，随时都有继续发生此类事件的可能。公司爱卫会召集有关人员研究出多种灭鼠办法，但都由于影响供电而未能实现，只得派人向沈阳军区空军新型鼠药厂负责人单承仪求援。被人们称为“灭鼠大王”的单承仪当即放下手中的工作，赶到这个变电所。他察看鼠情，设置监测机制，投放快速药饵，老鼠当晚就被制服了。经连续三天三夜的科学监测，鼠迹消失，安全可靠地保障了供电。鞍山市爱卫会召开了全市灭鼠人员的现场会议，让大家目击单承仪在白天诱鼠出洞，争吞毒饵，纷纷暴死于众目睽睽之下的奇观。
