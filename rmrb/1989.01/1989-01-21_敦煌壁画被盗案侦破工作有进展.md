The investigation into the theft of Dunhuang murals has made progress. Today at 15:45, our reporter accompanied officials from the Gansu Provincial Public Security Bureau to visit Cave 465 in the Mogao Caves in Dunhuang. The reporter discovered that on January 13th, in addition to the theft of five mural pieces, two other murals had been damaged.

In the rear chamber of Cave 465, there are three "Mandala" murals on the west wall. The southernmost one features a 27 cm high and 22 cm wide image of a Vajra deity that was stolen on the 13th. The reporter noticed that the two Esoteric Buddhist images adjacent to the stolen Vajra deity on the left were also targets of the criminals. One image was cut from the right side, and the other was cut from the left and bottom sides, leaving unsightly scars on the once vibrant and beautiful artwork.

Local authorities analyzing the features of the stolen murals pointed out that the stolen pieces are located in the lower part of the overall mural and are relatively small Esoteric Buddhist images. This makes it easier for the criminals to steal and carry away. Although the murals in the lower part are not as clear as those in the upper part, each piece is exquisitely painted and is an irreplaceable treasure.

Further reports indicate that after several days of investigation, the Gansu Provincial Public Security Bureau has confirmed that the criminals who stole the murals from Cave 465 in the Mogao Caves are two young men of different heights.

On the night of the 13th, the criminals infiltrated the Mogao Caves and committed crimes in six locations: Cave 465, the art research institute's storage room, the Bodhi Art Gallery, two handicraft shops, and a food shop.

Because the snow had just stopped, the criminals left clear footprints both indoors and on the snow. According to the on-site investigation and analysis, one of the criminals is approximately 1.66 meters tall, around 30 years old. Someone on a public bus noticed him wearing a blue jacket, white Global-brand sports shoes, and carrying a black bag. The other criminal is approximately 1.73 meters tall, slender, with slightly curly hair, and around 20 years old. He was wearing a yellow down jacket, Double Arrow-brand hiking shoes (with English letters), and carrying a red and blue plaid plastic woven bag approximately 40x50 cm in size.

　　敦煌壁画被盗案侦破工作有进展
    本报敦煌１月２０日电  记者张述圣报道：今日１５时４５分记者随甘肃省公安厅负责同志进入敦煌莫高窟４６５窟采访时发现，这个洞窟１３日遭窃时，除了有５块壁画失盗外，还有２块壁画遭到破坏。
    ４６５窟后室西壁画有３铺“曼荼罗”，南侧的一铺中有一幅高２７厘米、宽２２厘米的明王像１３日被盗走。记者注意到，被盗明王像左边上下并列的两幅密宗图像也曾是案犯猎取对象，一幅被从右侧切割一刀，一幅从左右侧和下端切割三刀，艳丽照人的画面上，留下了令人扼腕痛惜的刀痕。
    此间有关人士分析遭窃壁画特点时说，这次失盗的壁画在整铺画面上部位靠下，而且是面积较小的秘宗图像，这样，案犯较易得手，携带方便。部位靠下的壁画没有上半部分的壁画清晰，但是每一幅都画得极为精湛，都是失而不可复得的瑰宝。
    又讯　甘肃省公安机关经过连续几天的侦破后确认，盗窃敦煌莫高窟４６５窟壁画的案犯是身材高低不等的两青年。
    １３日夜，案犯潜入莫高窟，先后在４６５窟、美术研究所库房、菩提荫画苑、两个工艺品门市部和食品门市部６处作案。
    因为大雪刚停，案犯在室内和雪地上留下了清晰的足迹。据现场勘察和调查后分析，其中一人身高约１．６６米左右，年龄在３０岁上下，有人在公共汽车上发现其“上着蓝色衣服，脚穿环球牌白色运动鞋，携带一黑色提包”。另一人身高１．７３米左右，体态较瘦，头发稍卷，年约２０岁左右，上着黄色防寒衣，脚穿双箭牌旅游鞋（英文字母）。携带约４０×５０厘米左右红蓝相间的塑料编织袋。
