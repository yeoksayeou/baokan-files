    Sichuan's cleanup and rectification of companies, after three months of self-inspection and investigation, has entered the stage of key spot checks and handling.

    —During the self-inspection and investigation, it was found that there are 16,355 various types of companies in the 21 prefectures, cities, and districts of the province. Among the 98 provincial-level units, 78 units have established 817 various types of companies, centers, groups, and consulting service departments. Among these, a considerable number of companies have issues with the separation of government and enterprise functions.

    —The issue of party and government cadres at the department level and above holding concurrent positions in companies has been properly handled. Except for 3 provincial-level cadres and 9 department-level cadres who, due to work needs, have been approved to temporarily retain their concurrent positions, the remaining 11 provincial-level cadres and 80 department-level cadres have all resigned from their concurrent positions. Among the 45 party and government leading cadres in various prefectures, cities, and districts who hold concurrent positions, 39 have resigned from their concurrent positions.

    —A number of companies have been rectified or dissolved, and a number of cases have been investigated and dealt with. 11 companies established by provincial-level organs have been ordered to suspend operations for rectification; 51 companies (enterprises) have been canceled; companies such as the New Light Tourism Service Company, which has been operating at a loss for a long time, and the Sichuan National Defense Industry Labor and Technology Company, which has illegally subcontracted projects and sought excessive profits, have been dissolved.
