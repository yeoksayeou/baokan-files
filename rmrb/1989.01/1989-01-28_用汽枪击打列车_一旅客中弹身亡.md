On October 30, 1988, at 3:52 PM, a 13-year-old passenger named Xie Changbao was struck by an airgun pellet in the left side of his head while traveling in Carriage 4 of Train 133 from Chengdu to Shanghai. The train was near Linhuai Station at the time. Xie was rushed to the hospital but died from his injuries. The perpetrator, Chen Jun, was later identified as a 15- or 16-year-old individual. On that day, Chen aimed his airgun at the moving train, and the pellet unfortunately hit Xie.

It is understood that incidents of young people using airguns, stones, and other objects to attack trains are not uncommon. From January to October 1988, the Shanghai Railway Bureau alone recorded 148 such incidents, with most of the perpetrators being middle and high school students. Relevant departments should strengthen legal and moral education for middle and high school students, and parents should also pay more attention to their children's upbringing to prevent similar incidents from happening.

　　用汽枪击打列车  一旅客中弹身亡
    １９８８年１０月３０日下午３时５２分，成都至上海的１３３次列车行至临淮关车站附近时，４号车厢一位年仅１３岁的旅客谢昌宝被车外飞来的汽枪子弹击中左耳上部，抢救无效死亡。经查，肇事者陈军，十五六岁。这天，他发现火车开来时，便举枪瞄准车厢，子弹正好打中谢昌宝。
    据了解，一些青少年用汽枪、石子等袭击列车的事件时有发生。１９８８年１月至１０月，仅上海铁路局就发生了１４８起击打列车事件，肇事者大部分是中小学学生。有关部门应加强对中小学生的法制、道德教育，家长也要关心子女的成长，避免类似事件发生。
