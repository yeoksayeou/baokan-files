    A Reexamination of Realism
    Liu Gangji

    This article summarizes: We need to distinguish between realism and the authenticity of literature. Realism is not boundless. True realism is a product of capitalist society since the Western Renaissance. Realism has its own historical development, and it is reasonable to add modifiers to it. Realism is just one of many schools. China needs a new enlightenment movement guided by Marxism, and needs the realism of enlightenment. Contemporary realism bears the important task of guiding the masses to deeply observe, understand, and think about contemporary Chinese reality. It should combine the ancient scientific and rational spirit with the contemporary pursuit of the meaning and value of the individual as a sensory existence.

    Over the past decade, contemporary Chinese literature has been strongly impacted by Western modernism, to an extent unprecedented. The powerful shockwave of modernism has pushed the realism we have long advocated to the side, but as this shockwave subsides, realism is once again receiving attention. Perhaps, in contemporary Chinese literature, realism and modernism will be two major, mutually stimulating currents? I believe that using realism to negate modernism, or vice versa, using modernism to negate realism, is neither feasible nor correct. The issue lies in how to scientifically define the essence and role of both from the perspective of contemporary world and Chinese reality, so that they can develop healthily. Currently, as modernism enters a phase of self-reflection, re-emphasizing realism and conducting in-depth research on it is an opportune moment. However, this is not to negate modernism or reduce it to realism, but to give realism, which has been neglected and even denied in the past, the attention and affirmation it deserves.

    So, what is realism? How should it be defined? What characteristics might contemporary realism possess?

    When defining realism, I believe we must first distinguish between realism and the authenticity of literature. Realistic literature is indeed authentic, but other non-realistic literature, including modernist literature, can also achieve authenticity, sometimes even profound authenticity. If we conflate realism with the authenticity of literature, we will blur the distinctions between various literary schools and ultimately fit all different schools into the framework of realism. This is obviously a simplistic idea that is not conducive to the development of literature. I agree with the view that realism should be clearly defined; it is not boundless and can encompass any literary school. Realism should strive to establish its unique character, thus maximizing its advantages and standing out as an important and irreplaceable school among various literary schools, rather than dissolving into other schools.

    Reviewing the history of literature, I believe the following points may be the most essential characteristics of realism. First, realism fully affirms the subjectivity of man and the objective reality of the world he lives in. Although the understanding of this objectivity may not necessarily be based on what we usually call materialism, affirming this objectivity is a common characteristic of all realists. In contrast, various schools of Western modernism often regard the subject and the world he lives in as illusory and unreal. Second, realism seeks to depict the world as it is, rather than according to subjective wishes, emotions, or fantasies. This does not mean that every realist can completely achieve this, nor does it mean that realism is incompatible with the artist's subjective wishes, emotions, or fantasies. It means that the realist artist always places the true face of the external world first. He is aware of the differences between his subjective wishes, emotions, fantasies, and the objective reality of the external world, and does not replace the depiction of the world's true face with his wishes, emotions, or fantasies (artistic depiction). Third, realism demonstrates the powerful force of human rational cognition, taking a highly sober and clear attitude towards reality is an important feature of realism. Fourth, realism does not mean simply copying reality, nor does it negate or cancel the subjectivity of the artist. Instead, it uses the requirements of realism to inspire and elevate the artist's subjectivity. That is, the artist should, with a highly sober and clear attitude, delve into the essence of life and conduct a thorough dissection of the myriad aspects of the world. The subjectivity of the realist artist most clearly demonstrates the powerful force of rational cognition that is not deceived or misled by any external surface phenomena.

    Realism has its own historical development. Many books on literary history or literary theory claim that realism has existed since ancient times and that the development of literary history can be summarized as the struggle between realism and anti-realism. I believe this is a simplistic view that does not reflect reality. In fact, the pursuit of realism can be seen in ancient times, but this realism did not possess the essential characteristics we mentioned earlier. Instead, it was a factor within classicism. Whether in the West or in China, a major characteristic of classicism is the pursuit of an idealized harmony (Hegel has provided a very profound explanation of this), while rejecting the unadorned presentation of reality as it is. Although it can truly depict certain aspects of social life, it always covers it with an ideal veil or observes, captures, and shapes reality from the pursuit of an ideal realm. I believe that true realism in the proper sense is a product of capitalist society since the Western Renaissance. The emergence and development of capitalism, on the one hand, shattered various illusions that had been revered since ancient times, making people face themselves and the world around them with an unprecedentedly clear and realistic attitude. On the other hand, it promoted the rapid development of science, greatly enhancing the power of human rational cognition. Both of these factors powerfully influenced the development of literature, giving birth to true realism that is different from classicism. As for China, the birth of realism occurred after the mid-Ming Dynasty, that is, after the emergence of capitalist sprouts. Before this, Chinese literature contained elements of realism but was fundamentally classicist. Moreover, the realism that emerged afterward (represented by Ming and Qing novels) still carried very strong classicist colors and was often romanticized.

    Since realism has its own historical development, it is reasonable to add certain modifiers to the word "realism" to distinguish different eras and different tendencies of realism. These modifiers include two aspects: indicating the era and indicating the ideological tendency and worldview, with the latter being more important. For the West, I believe realism can be roughly divided into: humanist realism from the Renaissance, when capitalism was in its infancy and development, which still carried strong classicist elements and can be represented by Shakespeare; enlightenment realism of the preparatory period of the bourgeois revolution, which can be represented by British realist writers such as Fielding; realism after the victory of the bourgeois revolution, which, while retaining the spirit of enlightenment, was also deeply influenced by the positivist thought of the 19th century, which can be represented by Balzac. The 19th century was the period when realism reached a high degree of maturity and took on a typical form. During this period, Marx and Engels advocated realism that represented the demands of the proletariat. This was a major change in realism. Due to the specific historical conditions, Marx, Engels, and Lenin placed the greatest emphasis on realism in literature. Their various views on this issue, although in need of further study and development today, are undoubtedly a major contribution to the theory of realism. Overall, various different types of realism have appeared in literary history, which need to be studied in depth separately. As for contemporary times, there are also so-called "magical realism" and other terms. But any school of realism (realism itself contains multiple schools and is not singular), if it truly belongs to realism, I believe it will possess the aforementioned characteristics.

    For many years, the realism we have advocated is realism guided by the Marxist worldview, or what is also called socialist realism. I do not think this approach is necessarily to be completely denied, the issue lies in: first, we should not use this approach to exclude other non-realist schools, believing that the only school allowed in socialist literature is realism. Or to avoid this situation, we advocate that realism is open, including all schools that are actually different from realism into realism. In my opinion, we should acknowledge that realism is just one of many schools. We can demand that all schools should truly reveal the essence of life, but we should not demand that all schools must be realist. The true essence of life is very complex, containing different domains, aspects, and levels of truth, and each school can achieve the truth it can reach in its own unique way and path. If a school can no longer achieve truth, it will naturally be eliminated by history. Therefore, we should highly value realism while also valuing other schools that can achieve truth and are not realist. We should see that the true essence of life can only be fully, richly, and deeply revealed through various schools. Secondly, although we cannot say that all the works of realism we have talked about in the past are unreal and valueless (this is a biased view that is not historical), at the same time, we must also see that our past understanding and practice of realism indeed had serious problems. The most important of these was that it violated the fundamental characteristic of realism, which is to depict life as it is, and was unwilling, as Lu Xun said, to dare to face even the bleakest of lives, but used various subjective fantasies, erroneous, and even false revolutionary phrases to forcibly change the true face of reality, to the point of falling into the abyss of "deception and fraud" that Lu Xun also pointed out. Such "realism" is a thorough anti-realism, and its influence has not yet been completely eradicated today. A kind of idealism, ethics, and utopianism that is detached from reality is still present today. Finally, the recognition and depiction of life by socialist realism is, of course, aimed at the realization of socialism as an ideal goal, but we must see that the birth, development, and perfection of socialism is a very long and complex historical process. We must adhere to socialist ideology while ruthlessly abandoning all simplistic and erroneous utopianism, and without self-deception, observe the birth, growth, and manifestation of socialist ideology in real life. We should not erase its existence, but accurately write out the level it can actually reach in the current historical stage, without any idealization that is detached from reality. In particular, we should see the fact that feudal ignorance and backwardness still have a wide influence today. Facing this fact, China needs a new enlightenment movement guided by Marxism. This enlightenment movement is a continuation and development of the May Fourth enlightenment movement. Therefore, in literature, we not only need socialist realism, but also need the realism of enlightenment. The enlightenment realism of Western literary history is still of great importance to us today. The enlightenment realism of the May Fourth New Literature, represented by Lu Xun, which resolutely opposed feudalism and was combative, urgently needs to be carried forward by today's literary and artistic workers. Today's enlightenment realism should, under new historical conditions, maximize the powerful role of exposing, analyzing, and criticizing all feudal ignorance and backward thoughts, and uphold the thoughts of science, democracy, and humanity.

    Realism is known for its highly sober and clear spirit of rational analysis and criticism. If modernism tends to pursue and experience a certain metaphysical philosophy of the universe and life, then realism tends to be down-to-earth, conducting empirical analysis and dissection of real life. In our country's arduous and complex process of modernizing, we urgently need a highly sober and clear scientific spirit, which is precisely the spirit that realism possesses. Realism, since its inception, has been inseparable from the development of modern science and rational spirit. From today's literature, realism bears the important task of guiding the masses to deeply observe, understand, and think about contemporary Chinese reality. This is an urgent task posed by history, so the rejuvenation of realism in contemporary Chinese literature is inevitable.

    However, since this realism is realism under contemporary conditions, it will inevitably have different characteristics from historical realism. In short, this realism will combine the scientific and rational spirit of the 18th and 19th centuries with the pursuit of the meaning and value of the individual as a sensory existence since the 20th century. It will not abandon the scientific and rational spirit, but it will not, like the realism of the 18th and 19th centuries, regard the sensory existence of the individual as something determined a priori by some eternal and universal reason. It will stand on the basis of fully affirming the sensory existence of the individual to promote the scientific and rational spirit. Balzac's realism, which regarded people as plants determined by their environment for survival, will be replaced by realism that upholds the sensory existence of the individual. The individual will no longer be portrayed as something determined by the group and environment at every turn, but as an active subject who creates his own existence, but not the supernatural and mystical subject pursued by modernism, but still a real subject existing in the objective world. In addition, realism, which has always been inseparable from the development of scientific knowledge, will undoubtedly absorb various achievements of modern science, standing on a new historical foundation different from that of Balzac and others, to exert the unique rational cognitive power of realism, depict the new landscape of the contemporary world, and create various new methods of realism.

　　现实主义的重新认识 
    刘纲纪
    本文提要：要把现实主义和文艺的真实性区分开来。现实主义不是无边的。真正意义上的现实主义是西方文艺复兴以来资本主义社会的产物。现实主义有其发展的历史，在它的前面加上修饰语是合理的。现实主义只是各种流派中的一种。中国需要一个以马克思主义为指导的新的启蒙运动，需要启蒙主义的现实主义。当代现实主义担负着引导群众深入观察、认识思考中国当代现实的重大任务，应将古典的科学、理性精神和当代对人作为个体感性存在的意义与价值的追求结合起来。
    近１０年来，中国当代文艺受到了西方现代主义的冲击，其强烈的程度可以说前所未见。现代主义的强大冲击波把我们一向所提倡的现实主义冲到了一边，而当这股冲击波渐趋缓弱时，现实主义又重新受到关注。也许，在中国当代文艺中，现实主义与现代主义将是两大互相激荡的潮流？我认为，用现实主义去否定现代主义，或反过来用现代主义否定现实主义都是行不通的，不对的。问题只在如何从当代世界和中国的现实出发去科学地规定两者各自的实质和作用，使之得到健康的发展。在目前，当着现代主义进入对自身的反省的时候，重提现实主义并深入开展对它的研究，正是一个适当的时机。但这并不是要由此而否定现代主义，或将它归结为现实主义，而是要使在前一段时间受到忽视以致否定的现实主义得到应有的重视和肯定。
    那么，什么是现实主义？应当如何界定它？当代的现实主义应当或可能具有怎样的特点？
    在界定现实主义的时候，我认为首先要把现实主义和文艺的真实性这两个概念区分开来。现实主义的文艺当然是具有真实性的，但其他不属于现实主义的文艺，包括现代主义的文艺也同样可以达到真实性，有时还是很深刻的真实性。如果把现实主义和文艺的真实性混为一谈，那就会抹煞各个文艺流派的区别，最后把各种不同流派的文艺统统都纳入到现实主义的框子之中。这显然是一种不利于文艺发展的简单化的想法。我同意这样一种看法：对现实主义应加以明确的界定，它不是无边的，可以囊括任何一种文艺流派的。现实主义应致力于确立自身特有的品格，这样它才能最大限度地发挥自己的优越性，卓然成为诸文艺流派中一个不可取代的重要的流派，而不致使自己消融于其他流派之中。
    通观一下文艺史，我以为下述几点可能是现实主义的最本质的特征。第一、现实主义充分肯定作为主体的人及其所生活的周围世界是客观实在的东西。尽管对这种客观实在性的理解不一定就是建立在我们通常所说的唯物论的基础之上，但肯定这种客观实在性却是一切现实主义者共有的特征。相反，如西方现代主义诸流派则经常认为主体及其所生活的世界都是一种虚幻不实的东西。第二、现实主义力求按照世界的本来面目，而不是按照主观的愿望、情感、幻想去说明世界。这当然不是说每一个现实主义者都能完全地做到这一点，也不是说现实主义同艺术家主观的愿望、情感、幻想不能相容，而是说现实主义的艺术家始终把外部世界的本来面目放在第一位。他清醒地意识到他的主观的愿望、情感、幻想与客观实在的外部世界的差别，不以他的愿望、情感、幻想去代替对世界的本来面目的说明（艺术方式的说明）。第三、现实主义表现了人类理性认识的强大力量，对现实采取高度冷净、清醒的态度是现实主义的重要特色。第四、现实主义决不等于如实地复写现实，也决不取消和否定艺术家的主体性，而是要以现实主义的要求去激发、高扬艺术家的主体性。那就是要艺术家以高度冷静清醒的态度突入到生活本质的最深处去，对形形色色的大千世界作出入木三分的解剖。现实主义艺术家的主体性最为清楚地表现了不为一切外在表面现象所迷惑欺骗的理性认识的强大力量。
    现实主义有它自身发展的历史过程。不少关于文艺史或文艺理论的书认为现实主义自古已有，并把文艺史的发展归结为现实主义与反现实主义的斗争，我认为是不符合实际的简单化的看法。实际上，对现实主义的追求虽然在古代已可看到，但这种现实主义还不具备我们上述的那些本质特征，而只是包含在古典主义中的一个因素。不论在西方或中国，古典主义的一大特征是追求一种理想化的和谐（对此黑格尔作过甚为深刻的说明），而排斥对现实本来面目的不加任何理想化的呈现。虽然它也可以很真实地描写出某种社会生活，但总要罩上一层理想的面纱，或从对某种理想境界的追求出发去观照、摄取、塑造现实。真正意义上的现实主义我以为是西方文艺复兴以来资本主义社会的产物。资本主义的产生发展，一方面打破了自古以来受人尊崇的种种幻想，使人以前所未见的清醒的、现实的态度去对待自己和周围世界，另一方面又促进了科学的迅速发展，极大地提高了人的理性认识的力量。这两者都有力地作用于文艺的发展，使和古典主义不同的真正意义上的现实主义得以诞生。就中国而言，现实主义的诞生是在明代中叶以后，即资本主义萌芽出现以后。在此之前，中国的文艺包含有现实主义，但在根本上是古典主义的。而且在此之后产生的现实主义（明清小说是其代表）也仍然带有十分浓厚的古典主义色彩，并且经常是浪漫化了的。
    现实主义既然有其发展的历史，那么为了区别不同时代、不同倾向的现实主义，在“现实主义”这个词的前面加上某些修饰语，我认为是合理的。这种修饰语包含两个方面，一是标明时代，二是标明思想倾向、世界观，而后者又是更为重要的。就西方而言，我认为现实主义大体上可以划分为：从文艺复兴开始的，资本主义萌芽生长发展时期的人文主义的现实主义，这时的现实主义仍带有相当浓厚的古典主义色彩，可以莎士比亚为代表；资产阶级革命准备时期的启蒙主义的现实主义，可以英国出现的现实主义作家菲尔丁等人为代表；资产阶级革命胜利之后的，虽然还保留着启蒙主义精神，同时又深受１９世纪实证主义思潮影响的现实主义，这可以巴尔扎克为代表。１９世纪是现实主义达于高度成熟，取得了典型形态的时期。在这一时期，又出现了马克思、恩格斯所倡导的，代表着无产阶级要求的现实主义。这是现实主义的一个重大变化。由于特定历史条件的要求，马克思、恩格斯以及列宁在文艺上最为重视的是现实主义。他们围绕这一问题发表的种种见解，虽然在今天看来需要继续加以研究和发展，但无疑是对现实主义理论的重大贡献。总起来看，文艺史上出现了现实主义的各种不同类型，这是需要分别加以深入研究的。就当代而言，还有所谓“魔幻现实主义”等等名目。但任何一种现实主义的流派（现实主义本身包含多种流派，决非单一的），如果确属于现实主义，我认为它是会具有上面所说的诸特征的。
    多年以来，我们所提倡的现实主义是以马克思主义世界观为指导的现实主义，或又称为社会主义的现实主义。这样的一种提法我认为并不是必须加以彻底否定的，问题只在于：第一、不应以这种提法去排斥其他非现实主义的流派，认为社会主义文艺所能容许的流派就只是现实主义一派。或者为了避免这种情况的发生而主张现实主义是开放的，把一切实际上与现实主义不同的流派都包容到现实主义之中来。在我看来，我们应当如实地承认现实主义只是各种流派中的一个流派。我们可以要求一切流派都应当真实地揭示生活的本质，但不应要求一切流派都必须是现实主义的。所谓生活的本质的真实是十分复杂的，包含着不同领域、不同侧面、不同层次的真实，而每一流派都可以自身特殊的方式和途径去达到它所能达到的真实。如果某一流派已完全不能达到真实，那么它自然会被历史所淘汰。因此，我们既高度重视现实主义，同时也要重视其他同样可以达到真实的，不属于现实主义的流派。要看到生活的本质的真实只有通过各种各样的流派才能得到充分的、丰富的、深刻的展现。其次，虽然不能说我们过去所说的现实主义的作品统统是不真实的，没有价值的（这是一种非历史的偏颇之论），但同时又必须看到我们过去对现实主义的理解和实践的确存在着严重的问题。其中最主要的就是违背了现实主义是按照生活的本来面目去表现生活这一根本特征，不愿像鲁迅所说的那样，敢于直面哪怕是惨淡的人生，而用种种主观的幻想、错误的以至虚假的革命词句去强行改变现实的本来面目，直至陷入也是鲁迅所指出的“瞒和骗”的深渊。这样的“现实主义”恰恰是彻底的反现实主义，它的影响直到今天也并未完全肃清。一种脱离现实的理想主义、伦理主义、乌托邦主义在今天也仍然有所表现。最后，社会主义现实主义对生活的认识和表现当然是以社会主义的实现为理想目标的，但必须看到社会主义的产生、发展、完善是一个极为漫长复杂的历史过程。我们既要坚持社会主义思想，同时又要毫不可惜地抛弃一切简单化的、错误的空想，毫不自欺地去观察社会主义思想在现实生活中的产生、成长和表现。既不抹煞它的存在，同时又要精确地写出它在当前历史阶段上实际能够达到的水准，而不加以任何脱离实际的理想化。特别是要看到封建愚昧落后的思想在我们今天还有广泛的影响这样一个事实。面对这个事实，中国需要一个以马克思主义为指导的新的启蒙运动。这个启蒙运动是“五四”启蒙运动的继续和发展。因此，在文艺上，我们不但需要社会主义的现实主义，同时还需要启蒙主义的现实主义。西方文艺史上的启蒙主义的现实主义对我们今天还有不可忽视的重要意义，“五四”新文艺中以鲁迅为代表的，坚决反封建的、战斗的启蒙主义现实主义，亟待我们今天的文学艺术家大力地加以发扬。我们今天的启蒙主义的现实主义应当在新的历史条件下，最大限度地发挥对一切封建愚昧落后思想的揭露、分析、批判的强大作用，高扬科学、民主和人道的思想。
    现实主义是以拥有高度冷静清醒的理性的分析批判精神而著称的。如果说现代主义偏向于对某种形而上的宇宙人生哲理的追求和体验，那么现实主义则偏向于形而下的，对现实人生的实证的分析和解剖。在我国进向现代化的艰难复杂的历程中，我们十分需要一种高度冷静清醒的科学精神，这正是现实主义所具有的精神。现实主义从它产生的时候开始，就同近代科学、理性的精神的发展分不开。从我们今天的文艺来说，现实主义担负着引导广大群众深入观察、认识思考中国当代现实的重大任务。这是历史所提出的迫切任务，因此在中国当代文艺中，现实主义的重新繁荣是必然的。
    但这种现实主义既然是当代条件下的现实主义，它不可避免地会具有和历史上的现实主义不同的特点。要而言之，这种现实主义将把１８至１９世纪科学的、理性的精神和２０世纪以来对人作为个体感性存在的意义与价值的追求结合起来。它不会抛弃科学的理性的精神，但它又不会像１８、１９世纪的现实主义那样，把个体的感性存在看作是由某种永恒普遍的理性先验地决定的东西。它将立足于对个体感性存在的充分肯定的基础之上去发扬科学、理性的精神。巴尔扎克的那种认为人就像植物一样为生存环境所决定的现实主义，将代之以高扬个体感性存在的现实主义。个体将不再被表现为处处由群体、环境所决定的东西，而是能动地去创造自身的存在的主体，但又不是现代主义所追求的那种超现实的、神秘虚无的主体，而仍然是生存于客观世界中的现实的主体。此外，历来就同科学认识的发展不可分离的现实主义，无疑将吸取现代科学的种种成果，站在与巴尔扎克等人的时代不同的新的历史基地之上，去发挥现实主义特有的理性认识的力量，描绘出当代世界的新图景，并创造出各种现实主义的新手法。
