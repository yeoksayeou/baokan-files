The construction of the 11th Asian Games, to be held in Beijing next year, faces more challenges than successes. It is understood that approximately 60% of the work on the sports venues has not been completed.

By the end of 1988, 15 medium and small-sized sports venues had been basically completed. Other competition venues have mostly reached their planned construction stages. For example, the stadium in Tu Cheng in the northern suburbs, which will be used for the Asian Games athletics events, has completed its structural construction. The gymnasium and swimming pool, which will be used for handball, swimming, diving, and other events, are undergoing truss installation. The land-based construction of the Hai Zi Reservoir water sports venue in Beijing's Pinggu County and the Qinghuangdao sea sports venue is nearing completion.

Met Jueju, deputy commander of the Asian Games Engineering Command, said that the Asian Games engineering projects achieved decisive victories in 1988, realizing the deployment of clearing the outskirts and shifting the construction focus to the northern suburbs sports center. However, this responsible official pointed out that the construction situation this year is more severe than last year. Under conditions of severe funding shortages and material deficiencies, the builders of the Asian Games must complete a large number of supporting projects and municipal engineering projects that directly serve the Asian Games, such as training venues, athletes' villages, and press centers. The 1280,000 square meters of greening projects must also complete 60% of the total work this year to facilitate the Asian Olympic Council's inspection in October.

If the Asian Games engineering, which has been ongoing for more than two years, is considered a long-distance run, then this year will be the year of arduous sprinting for the builders.

The Beijing municipal government is taking various measures to support the construction of the Asian Games engineering projects to the fullest extent possible in terms of funding, materials, and construction forces.

Recently, the Asian Games Engineering Command held a mobilization meeting, calling on more than 40,000 builders from over 150 units to unite, strive, work day and night, and spare no effort to ensure that the Asian Games engineering projects are completed on schedule.

### 亚运会工程建设忧多于喜

　　亚运会工程建设忧多于喜
    明年在北京举行的第十一届亚运会的工程建设忧多于喜。据了解，迄今尚有约６０％的体育场馆工作量没有完成。
    截至１９８８年底，已有１５座中、小型体育场馆已基本竣工。其它比赛场馆也大多达到了预定的施工部位。例如，位于北郊土城将用于亚运会田径比赛的体育场已完成结构施工，将用于手球、游泳、跳水等项比赛的体育馆和游泳馆正进行网架吊装；北京平谷县海子水库水上运动场和秦皇岛海上运动场陆地建筑施工已接近尾声。
    亚运会工程指挥部副总指挥顾钥菊说，亚运会工程在１９８８年取得了决定性的胜利，实现了扫清外围、把施工重点转入北郊体育中心的部署。但是，这位负责人指出，今年的工程建设形势比去年更为严峻。在资金严重不足、物资短缺的情况下，亚运会工程的建设者们必须将训练场馆、运动员村、新闻中心等一大批直接为亚运会服务的配套工程和市政工程全面竣工；１２８万平方米的绿化工程也必须在今年内完成总工作量的６０％，以便亚奥理事会今年１０月进行验收。
    如果说已历时两年多的亚运会工程是一场长跑，那么今年则将是它的建设者们艰苦冲刺的一年。
    北京市政府正采取各种措施，从资金、物资、施工力量等方面竭尽全力，支持亚运会工程建设。
    最近，亚运会工程总指挥部召开动员大会，号召来自１５０多个单位的４万多名建设者，团结奋斗，日夜苦战，全力以赴，确保亚运会工程如期完工。
