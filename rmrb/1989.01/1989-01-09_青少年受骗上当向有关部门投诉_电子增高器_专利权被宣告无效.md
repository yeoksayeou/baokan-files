	Youths Deceived Seek Redress, "Electronic Height Enhancer" Patent Declared Invalid

	People's Daily reports: The Patent Reexamination Board of the China Patent Office declared the patent for the "Electronic Height Enhancer" invalid before the end of the year.

	Recently, the "Electronic Height Enhancer" caused a stir in society. Some young people used this device, but instead of growing taller, they suffered burns on related acupuncture points. These victims have lodged complaints with relevant authorities and some news organizations. The China Consumer News Agency, based on numerous complaints, requested the Patent Reexamination Board to declare the utility model patent for the "Electronic Height Enhancer" invalid.

	After nearly a year of review, the Patent Reexamination Board declared the patent invalid, primarily because it does not meet the requirements of Article 22, Paragraph 3 of the Patent Law regarding creativity. This paragraph states that a utility model patent application must have creativity. After a search, it was found that the "Electronic Height Enhancer" is similar to some medical pulse stimulation electrotherapy devices that have already been disclosed. Comparing the circuit diagrams of these electrotherapy devices with the main structure of the "Electronic Height Enhancer," there are no substantial differences. It can also be said that, except for the method of use, these electrotherapy devices include all other technical features of the "Electronic Height Enhancer." The selection of different parts of the body is merely a difference in the method of using the device. According to the relevant provisions of the Patent Law, the method of use is not within the scope of protection for utility model patents. The "Electronic Height Enhancer" manual does not provide any explanation of the specific effects of the device and does not provide clinical trial reports that meet the requirements and have scientific basis, so it cannot be said to have any substantial features or progress.

	Why was a patent granted by the Patent Office later declared invalid? A responsible person from the relevant department explained that this is because the patent granted by the Patent Office in accordance with the provisions of the Patent Law is only presumed to be valid and cannot guarantee that it is absolutely valid. Whether a patent is truly valid still needs to be tested in practice after it is approved. Due to various subjective and objective reasons, even if the Patent Office conducts a thorough and strict examination of patent applications in accordance with the law, it is inevitable that a very small number of patent applications that should not be approved may be approved.

### 青少年受骗上当向有关部门投诉  “电子增高器”专利权被宣告无效

　　青少年受骗上当向有关部门投诉
   “电子增高器”专利权被宣告无效
    本报讯  中国专利局专利复审委员会年前宣告：“电子增高器”专利权无效。
    前一段时间，“电子增高器”曾在社会上引起轩然大波，有一些青年人使用这种增高器后，身材没有长高，反而使有关穴位受到灼伤。这些受害青年纷纷向有关机关和一些新闻单位投诉。中国消费者报社根据众多投诉者的反映，向专利复审委员会提出宣告“电子增高器”实用新型专利权无效的请求。
    专利复审委员会经过近一年的审理，宣告该专利权无效的理由主要是：它不符合《专利法》第二十二条第三款关于创造性的要求。这一款规定，申请专利的实用新型应当具有创造性。经检索，发现“电子增高器”与一些已被公开了的医用电刺激脉冲电疗仪大同小异。以这些电疗仪的电路框图同“电子增高器”的主要构造相比，没有什么实质性的区别。也可以说，除使用方法之外，这些电疗仪包括了“电子增高器”的其它所有技术特征。选用身体的不同部位，只是仪器使用方法的差别。而根据《专利法》的有关规定，使用方法不是实用新型专利保护的范畴。“电子增高器”的说明书对该仪器的具体效果没有提供任何说明，更没有提供符合要求的有科学依据的临床试验报告，所以谈不上有什么实质性的特点和进步。
    经专利局审查授予的专利权，为什么还会被宣告无效呢？有关部门负责人解释，这是由于专利局按照《专利法》的规定所授予的专利权，只是推定为其有效，而不能保证它绝对有效。一项专利是否真正有效，还需要在其被批准之后经受实践的检验。由于各种主、客观原因，专利局依法对专利申请所进行的审查即使极其全面和严格，也难免出现很少数不应被批准的专利申请却被批准的情况。
