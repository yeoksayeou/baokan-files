The Dual Challenges of a Student Abroad
— An Interview with Zhao Yifan
Qian Ning

Zhao Yifan's name has recently become more familiar to people, mainly because of the series of "Harvard Reading Notes" he published in the magazine *Reading*. In this column, he humorously and insightfully introduced a series of American cultural and intellectual figures, showcasing the unique perspective and knowledge of a new generation of students abroad. At 38 years old, Zhao Yifan, a "sent-down youth," belongs to a generation of "contemporaries of the Republic" who have been tempered by hardship yet retain their sharpness. After graduating from the Graduate School in 1981, he was selected by the Institute of Foreign Literature of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences to study in the United States. After nearly five years of rigorous "Western" education at Harvard University's Faculty of Arts and Sciences, he became the first Chinese mainland student to obtain a Ph.D. in Western Humanities from Harvard, and returned to China to work in 1986.

Towards the end of last year, on an afternoon, Zhao Yifan, who was about to go to the United States to submit his thesis, sat with the reporter in the sofa of the elevator on the 11th floor of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences building, discussing his various experiences of going abroad and returning.

Reporter: When you went to Harvard, the domestic literary criticism circle was in the midst of heated debates about Western modernism. Suddenly finding yourself in a Harvard classroom, listening to foreign professors lecture from Greek and Roman times to postmodernism and Paris structuralism, it must have required some psychological resilience?

Zhao: My initial feeling upon arriving at Harvard was like "the sky falling and the earth collapsing." The problem was not with language or professional training, but rather the realization that I was like a "barbarian" in terms of knowledge structure and thought patterns. Due to being isolated from the world for too long, the first batch of students sent abroad after opening up inevitably experienced this kind of intellectual shock or "academic trauma." To be more specific, American humanities disciplines began interdisciplinary integration and mixed training in the 1930s, and after World War II, this became a regular institution. For example, in literary research, students not only need to understand history, philosophy, language, and versions, but should also delve into society, politics, psychology, religion, culture, anthropology, and computers, and so on. Looking back, the teaching mechanism we formed based on the adjustment of colleges and universities in the 1950s indeed had many flaws. The professional closure and segmentation caused a narrow vision in single disciplines, single languages, and single directions. It's like a farmer who has tilled two acres of land all his life, suddenly being told to turn around and go in a different direction. There were domestic students who joked that if the professor was a specialist in Redology, the student would either study Dai Yu or focus on Xue Baochai, so that the mentor could develop the theory of the unity of Dai Yu and Baochai. This kind of scholarship becomes narrower and narrower, with a sense of being buried together.

Reporter: Being able to settle down to study "Dream of the Red Chamber" is already considered lucky. If you were to encounter a third or fourth-rate research object, that would truly be a "lifetime mistake."

Zhao: This involves a deeper issue, that is, as a great and excellent nation, can we open up and progress in our way of thinking and ensure the overall intellectual sensitivity and spiritual health of the academic community. When I first arrived at Harvard, I saw the golden inscription of Plato's words on the lectern: "I love my teacher, but I love truth more." Comparing this with China's saying "one day as a teacher, a lifetime as a disciple," I was truly moved. Due to habit, it took me a long time to adapt to that kind of free discussion where students criticize their teachers face to face. Later, I found that the teachers really encouraged everyone to criticize and pick apart their latest theoretical works, and only then did I "tear off the facade" and open up my mind to become that kind of "academic warrior."

Reporter: Does this training method not produce some side effects by emphasizing rebellion and innovation too much? For example, the disruption of tradition and the collapse of authority?

Zhao: The cultural turmoil and academic revolution of the 1960s indeed caused some troubles for the American academic community. Currently, under the trend of neoconservatism, there is a gradual emphasis on the balance between critical innovation and basic training, calling for the integration and reconstruction of various disciplines. In this regard, the rigorous and solid style of Harvard's Western Humanities is unforgettable. I remember in a discussion class, I mentioned a few books from the 1960s, and immediately my advisor interrupted me, pointing out that these books were not up to standard, and lectured the whole class, saying: "Remember, Harvard does not discuss non-classical works. If you are interested, you can read them after graduation, but my class does not allow it." At that time, I was very dissatisfied. Looking back now, I am truly grateful to that teacher because he taught me accurate and reliable knowledge and also let the students cultivate a long-term beneficial standard of judgment. On the other hand, Harvard professors still highly value the independent entrepreneurial ability of advanced graduate students. One of my advisors thus guided the graduating class: "True scholars and thinkers are those who dare to sit on the academic community's head and speak to the times." After studying like this for a few years, I really felt a bit "spoiled."

Reporter: Spoiled? Does that mean you didn't adapt when you returned to the country? It's not as if you experienced another "sky falling and earth collapsing," is it?

Zhao: It wasn't that intense, but in many aspects, I tasted new bitterness and was forced to accept unexpected "challenges." I summarized it: after returning to the country, overseas students generally have to go through three different stages of trials before they can truly establish themselves and develop. The first stage is the adaptation of material life. After being away from the country for many years, suddenly returning to the country, the feeling is like when I was sent down to the countryside, it was so hard. In my first year back, I temporarily lived in an old house. In the middle of the night, a strong wind blew the broken window, and I had to sit up and wait for dawn, smoking a cigarette and imagining the future...

Reporter: It's very much like entering the realm of Du Fu's poetry.

Zhao: Yes, if only there were a few small houses, it would solve the accommodation problems of many intellectuals and overseas students. But how difficult is that! Many leaders from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the Institute of Foreign Literature, and the Institute of American Studies were involved in my housing issue. Finally, I managed to have a home where I could put down my books and computer. Then came the economic difficulties, the salary could not support my wife and daughter. Writing columns for *Reading* was really a bit of a struggle for "rice and vegetables." To be honest, if it weren't for the concern and encouragement of the unit leaders, especially the economic support from Sanlian Bookstore and *Reading* magazine, I would also have had the thought of "reversing the flow."

Reporter: For returning overseas students, it's not easy to get through this stage. What's the next stage?

### 留学生的双重磨练——访赵一凡

　　留学生的双重磨练
    ——访赵一凡
    钱宁
    赵一凡的名字近来渐为人知，主要是因为《读书》杂志接连发表了他十几篇“哈佛读书札记”。在这个专栏里，他亦庄亦谐地评点介绍了一系列美国文化思想名人，显出新一代留学生不凡的眼光和见识。今年３８岁的赵一凡，“知青”出身，属于久经磨练而锐气犹存的那一代“共和国的同龄人”。１９８１年研究生院毕业后，他即由中国社会科学院外国文学所选送留美。经过在哈佛大学文理研究院近五年正规严格的“西化”教育，成为获得哈佛西方文科博士资格的第一个中华人民共和国公派留学生，并于１９８６年回国工作。
    去年岁末的一个下午，即将赴美递交论文的赵一凡同记者坐在社科院大楼１１层电梯的沙发上，谈起去兮归来的种种感受。
    记者：你去哈佛读书那年，国内文论界正为西方现代派争得不亦乐乎。一下子坐进哈佛课堂，听洋教授从希腊罗马讲到后现代派和巴黎结构主义，大概很需要些心理承受能力吧？
    赵：我初到哈佛的感觉，可说是“天塌地陷”。问题不在于语言或专业训练不足，而是痛感自己在知识结构与思想方式上像个“野蛮人”。由于闭关锁国太久，开放之后首批派出的留学生难免遭受这种思想震荡或称“学术休克”。具体些说，美国人文学科自３０年代开始科际整合和混合训练，二战后遂成为正规制度。比如文学研究，学生不但要懂历史、哲学、语言和版本，还应当涉足社会、政治、心理、宗教、文化、人类学和计算机等等领域。回过头看，我们在５０年代院校调整基础上形成的教学机制确实有不少弊病。专业上的封闭切割造成单学科、单语种、单方向的视界偏狭。就好比一辈子伺弄二亩地的老农，你乍一让他出门非转向不可。有国内同学开玩笑说，如果先生是红学专家，学生要么研究黛玉，要么专攻宝钗，好让导师发展钗黛合一论。这种学问越做越窄，颇有些陪葬的意味。
    记者：能定下来研究《红楼梦》就算是幸运儿了。要是摊上个三、四流研究对象，那才真要“误了终生”。
    赵：这牵涉到一个更深层的问题，即作为一个伟大而优秀的民族，我们在思想方式上能否开放进取并保证知识界整体的思想敏锐和精神健康。刚到哈佛时，看到讲堂上端金光闪闪的柏拉图语录：“吾爱吾师，吾更爱真理”。对比中国“一日为师，终生执弟子礼”的训条，我真是感慨万端。由于习惯，我很久未能适应那种学生当面批判导师的自由讨论。后来发现老师真的常鼓励大家批评挑剔他们的最新理论著作，这才“撕破面皮”，敞开思路，去当那种“学术武士”。
    记者：这种训练方式是否会因太强调反叛创新而产生一些副作用呢？比如传统断裂，权威瓦解？
    赵：６０年代的文化动乱和学术革命的确给美国学术界造成不少麻烦。目前新保守主义趋势下，渐渐强调批判创新与基础训练的并重，号召各学科整合重建。这方面哈佛西方文科的严格扎实风格令人难忘。记得我在一次讨论课上提及几本６０年代著作，当即被导师打断话头，指出这些书未入流，还教训全班说：“记住，哈佛不讨论非经典著作。有兴趣的话，毕业后你们自己去读，但我的堂上不允许。”当时我极不服气。现在回想起来真感谢那位老师，因为他教给我准确牢靠的知识，还让学生培养起长期受益的判别标准。另一方面，哈佛教授对高班研究生的独立创业能力仍非常看重，我的一位导师就这样开导毕业班：“真正的学问家、思想家是那些敢于将屁股坐在学术界脑袋上面向时代发言的人。”如此学了几年，可真有些被“惯坏了”的感觉。
    记者：惯坏了？是不是回国之后又不适应了？总不至于又一次“天塌地陷”吧？
    赵：没那么强烈，但在许多方面尝到了新的苦头，被迫接受未曾预料到的“挑战”。我总结了一下，留学生回国后，大致要经历三个不同阶段的考验方能真正立足，并有所发展。第一阶段是物质生活上的适应。去国经年，突然返回国内，感觉就像当初插队时那样艰苦。我回来头一年暂住在一间旧屋里。半夜大风吹落破窗，我只好披衣坐待天明，一边抽烟，一边设想今后……
    记者：很像是入了老杜的诗境。
    赵：是啊，安得小屋若干套，不就能解决众多知识分子和留学生的安置问题了？可这谈何容易！为我的住房曾惊动社科院和外文所、美国所许多领导。最后总算有了个家，能放下书籍和计算机。接着是经济窘困，工资养不起妻子女儿。给《读书》写专栏文章，实在是有点为“稻粱谋”。说句真心话，若不是单位领导关心鼓励，尤其是三联书店和《读书》杂志的经济支持，我亦会有“倒流”之心的。
    记者：对回国留学生来说，能熬过这一关很不容易。下一关呢？（上）（附图片）
