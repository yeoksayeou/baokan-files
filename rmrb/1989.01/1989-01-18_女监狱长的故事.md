The Story of a Female Prison Warden

By Mao Lei, Reporter for the People's Daily

Sun Shulan is slim and speaks slowly. She is the deputy warden of the women's prison in Gezhi Prison, Heilongjiang Province, and people habitually call her the "female prison warden." It is hard to believe, unless you see her in person, that this 36-year-old woman manages 646 female inmates.

Women who have committed crimes such as murder, robbery, hooliganism, theft, and fraud in society, when they are in prison, follow the rules, and their daily routines, living, and labor are all orderly. This is certainly not an easy task.

Liu Lingrong, who entered prison directly from middle school, was sentenced to 15 years in prison for committing an explosion crime at the instigation of her father. She thought, "My father and brother have already been executed, my mother has no job, and my younger brother is still young. What is there to hope for?" After more than a year in prison, she ate and drank very little, feeling pessimistic and hopeless.

After learning about this, Sun Shulan talked to Liu Lingrong about life and chatted with her like an older sister, showing her care and love. This helped her overcome her despair and regain her spirit. Liu Lingrong studied electrical engineering diligently and has now become a key production worker in the women's prison. On December 12th of last year, she was rewarded with a two-year sentence reduction.

Inmate Wang Chunhua, after entering prison, did not obey the rules, was lazy, often violated prison regulations, and bullied other inmates. She injured several people and became a notorious leader among the inmates. Sun Shulan talked to Wang Chunhua more than twenty times over a year. Her sincerity moved the stone, and Wang Chunhua changed her ways, starting to reform actively.

The women's prison in Gezhi Prison is actually a garment processing factory. The reporter saw that female inmates with prison numbers on their chests sat neatly on the production line, working in harmony and skillfully. Sun Shulan told us that some female inmates, after several years in prison, learned excellent tailoring skills. After being released, they became self-employed tailors and became millionaires.

As the deputy warden of the women's prison, Sun Shulan not only has to manage the inmates but also has to run the factory. After taking office in 1984, she made her first appointment, boldly hiring more than a dozen retired workers from the original garment factory, ensuring the technical, equipment, and quality aspects of the women's prison production.

She also considered hiring a recently released female worker who had served her sentence to be the head of the sample design group, managing the women's prison sample design and responsible for technical work. At the time, many people did not understand and criticized her, interfering with her work. She stood firm against public opinion and insisted on keeping this person employed, arranging for her to settle down. This employee was deeply moved and contributed many suggestions for the women's prison production, saving the prison more than 8,000 yuan in materials in one year.

Over the years, Sun Shulan has hired four sentenced workers who had completed their terms, arranging them in important production and technical positions in the women's prison. Now they are all key production workers.

When Sun Shulan's work showed some progress, some people made sarcastic remarks. Some even spread rumors and slandered her.

Sun Shulan did not defend herself or complain. To get rid of her troubles, she worked hard. The prison leadership clarified the facts, punished the rumor-mongers. At this time, Sun Shulan, with tears in her eyes, said deeply, "Only today do I truly feel the taste and weight of being understood by others."

The work of the female prison warden is heavy, but Sun Shulan did not relax her studies. She enrolled in a correspondence class for junior college and a correspondence class for enterprise management at the undergraduate level, striving to improve her political and professional qualities. She has her own pursuits in life.

In the women's prison of Gezhi Prison, she has spent 14 springs and autumns. Someone joked, "Inmates have fixed-term sentences, but prison guards have life sentences." Sun Shulan did not think much of it. She loves her work and walks her own path step by step.

　　女监狱长的故事
    本报记者  毛磊
    孙淑兰，清瘦，说话慢条斯理。她是黑龙江省革志监狱女监大队大队长，人们习惯称她为“女监狱长”。不是亲眼见到她，很难让人相信，３６岁的她，管理着６４６名女犯。
    曾经在社会上杀人、抢劫、流氓、盗窃、诈骗作恶的妇女，在监狱里规规矩矩，起居、生活、劳作，一律按部就班，确非易事。
    从初中门迈进监狱门的刘玲珑，被判处１５年有期徒刑。受父亲唆使，她犯了爆炸罪。她心里想：“爸爸、哥哥都已被枪决，妈妈没有工作，弟弟又小，还有什么盼头呢？”入狱一年多，她整天少吃少喝，悲观失望。
    孙淑兰得知此事后，找刘玲珑谈人生、拉家常，像大姐姐一样关心、爱护她，使她摆脱厌世情绪，振奋精神。刘玲珑刻苦钻研电工技术，现已成为女监独当一面的生产骨干。去年１２月１２日，她得到减刑两年的奖励。
    罪犯王春华，入监后不服从管教，好逸恶劳，经常违犯监规纪律，随意欺负其他女犯，几次打伤人，成了牢头狱霸，犯人都怕她。孙淑兰一年多来，找王春华谈话二十多次，精诚所至，顽石为开，王春华服了，走上了积极改造的道路。
    革志监狱女监，实际上是个服装加工厂。记者见到，胸前佩戴监号的女犯，端坐在生产流水线上，相互配合默契，操作熟练。孙淑兰告诉我们，有的女犯几年狱中生涯，学得一手好裁剪，出狱后当个体裁缝，成了万元户。
    孙淑兰作为女监的大队长既要管好犯人，又要理好工厂。１９８４年她走马上任后，第一次组阁，大胆聘用十几名原服装厂的退休工人，使女监的生产在技术、设备、质量等各个环节有了保障。
    她还曾考虑启用一名刚出监的刑满释放女工任考料组组长，管理女监考料设计，负责技术工作。一时间，许多人不理解，愤愤然，说长道短，横加干涉。她顶住舆论的压力，毅然留下此人就业，并为她安排落户。这位就业人员深受感动，为女监生产献计献策，一年就在考料方面为女监节省原材料８０００余元。
    几年来，孙淑兰先后启用四名刑满就业人员，安排在女监重要的生产技术岗位，现都成为生产骨干。
    孙淑兰工作有点起色，便有人说开风凉话。更有甚者，竟造谣中伤她。
    孙淑兰并没有为自己辩解鸣屈。她为了摆脱烦恼，忘我工作。监狱领导出面澄清了是非，处分了造谣者。这时，孙淑兰含着泪水深情地说：“直到今天，我才真正感受到被人理解的滋味和份量。”
    女监狱长工作繁重，孙淑兰并没有因此而放松了学习。她报考了中专函授班和企业管理函授大专班，努力提高自己的政治素质和业务素质。对生活，她有她的追求。
    在革志监狱女监，她已度过了１４个春秋。有人开玩笑地说：“犯人是有期徒刑，而管教干部却是无期徒刑。”孙淑兰对此不以为然。她热爱自己的事业，在一步一个脚印地走自己的路。
