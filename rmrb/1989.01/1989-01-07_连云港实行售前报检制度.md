Lianyungang Implements Pre-Sale Inspection System

    A reporter from our newspaper, Gong Yongquan, reports: The Industrial and Commercial Administrative Bureau of Lianyungang City, Jiangsu Province, has implemented a pre-sale inspection system for fertilizers, pesticides, and branded bicycles, achieving good results.

    Through pre-sale inspections, Lianyungang City's Donghai, Haizhou, and Xinpu districts have shut down 45 illegal fertilizer and pesticide trading units, uncovering 2,000 tons of fake and substandard fertilizers and 54 tons of pesticides. Many business departments and consumers have begun to recognize the importance of "inspection." Some stores bring samples to the quality inspection department for inspection before making large purchases, and only proceed with the purchase after the samples are deemed qualified. In some areas, the situation has improved to the point where units selling fake and substandard goods dare not stock them, and problematic goods cannot enter the market.

　　连云港实行售前报检制度
    本报讯  记者龚永泉报道：江苏连云港市工商行政管理局对化肥、农药、名牌自行车等商品，实行售前报检制度，取得良好效果。
    通过售前报检，连云港市东海、海州、新浦等县区取缔化肥、农药非法经营单位四十五个，查出假劣化肥二千吨，农药五十四吨。不少商业部门和消费者开始树立“报检”意识。有些商店在大批进货前先拿样品到质检部门报检，经认定合格后才去进货。一些地区已经出现了假劣商品销售单位不敢进，有问题的商品进不了市场的好局面。
