The China Social Welfare Lottery Committee revealed yesterday that by the end of 1988, a total of 500 million welfare lottery tickets had been issued nationwide, raising 150 million yuan for social welfare funds. Most of the welfare funds have already been put to use, yielding significant social and economic benefits.

Since July 1987, the committee has issued social welfare lottery tickets in 28 provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government, and 11 cities with separate planning status, excluding Xinjiang and Tibet. After deducting the costs for prize money and management, 40% of the total ticket sales were allocated as welfare funds. The committee has formulated the "Trial Measures for the Use of Social Welfare Funds," specifying the scope of fund usage. 80% of the collected welfare funds remain in the local areas, while the rest is remitted to the committee. Currently, a significant portion of the committee's welfare funds is used to support 21 key welfare projects, as well as welfare production, rehabilitation for the disabled, Red Cross activities, and relief efforts for the Yunnan earthquake.

In some regions where the issuance of social welfare lottery tickets has been successful, the previously tight social welfare funds have begun to ease. In 1988, Guangdong Province issued lottery tickets, raising 28.544 million yuan for social welfare funds. By the end of last year, the province had allocated and planned to allocate 9.72 million yuan for welfare funds, supporting the construction of 108 welfare projects. From August 1987 to October 1988, Shanghai Municipality raised over 46 million yuan for social welfare funds, of which 26 million yuan was used to establish the Shanghai Prosthetics Center, and the remaining 8.9 million yuan was fully returned to 18 welfare projects in various districts and counties.

The committee's responsible person stated that the use of social welfare funds has been generally good. However, some regions have not managed the funds tightly enough, with a portion of the funds still idle. Additionally, a few regions lack clarity in the direction of using social welfare funds. These issues need to be studied and resolved in the future.

　　资助福利事业　捐赠受灾地区
    全国发行福利奖券五亿元
    本报北京１月１０日讯  中国社会福利有奖募捐委员会负责人昨天透露：到１９８８年底，全国共发行福利奖券５亿张（元），筹得社会福利资金１．５亿元，大部分福利资金已经投入使用，并取得了可观的社会和经济效益。
    从１９８７年７月开始，中募委在全国除新疆、西藏外的２８个省、自治区、直辖市和１１个计划单列市发行社会福利奖券，除用于奖金返还、管理等费用外，筹得占奖券总额４０％的福利资金。中募委制定了《社会福利资金使用试行办法》，规定了资金使用范围。筹集的福利资金８０％留在地方，剩余部分上缴中募委。目前，中募委的大部分福利资金用于资助兴办重点福利事业项目２１个，资助福利生产、残疾人康复、红十字会活动以及云南地震救灾等项目。
    一些发行社会福利奖券比较好的地区，原社会福利资金紧张的状况开始缓解。１９８８年广东省发行奖券，获社会福利资金２８５４．４万元。到去年底，全省已投放和已立项计划投放的福利资金９７２万元，资助兴建了１０８个福利事业项目。上海市自１９８７年８月至１９８８年１０月，先后筹集社会福利资金４６０多万元，其中２６０万元用于筹建上海假肢中心，其余８９万元全部反馈给各个区、县的共１８个福利事业项目。
    中募委负责人说，社会福利资金的使用总的来说是好的。但有的地区对社会福利资金的使用抓得不紧，一部分福利资金还在“睡大觉”；还有少数地区对社会福利资金的使用方向不明确。这是需要今后认真研究解决的。
