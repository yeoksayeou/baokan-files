The sharp decrease in bank cash is also a problem troubling Shenyang City. According to authoritative sources, the amount of cash currently circulating among the people in Shenyang is as high as tens of billions of yuan, accounting for more than 80% of the total cash circulation in the city.

If we liken the circulation of money to the economic bloodstream, then the large amount of cash circulating in society poses a serious threat to the market where the supply of goods is still insufficient. Moreover, it also causes "blood loss" to the banks themselves. Due to the lack of cash, for a period of time, many enterprises and institutions were forced to delay the payment of wages and bonuses.

Facing the "blood loss" in the financial sector, some people are eagerly looking for the whereabouts of the missing money. Sun Xuebin, the president of the Shenyang Branch of the People's Bank of China and a senior economist, believes: The reason why banks are "losing blood" is not only due to the decrease in savings, some enterprises and institutions setting up small treasuries, and other factors, but also because in recent years, a new cash circulation cycle has emerged outside the banking system. To clarify the issue, President Sun drew a cash flow diagram. Before the reform, the basic channel for consumption cash in China was:

The state (through the bank) issues wages → state-owned or collective stores supply goods → cash is recollected to the bank → the state issues wages again.

Sun Xuebin calls this circulation cycle the "autologous blood circulation" under the direct control of the bank. This circulation, from the mid-1950s after the socialist transformation of industry and commerce to the present, has been used for more than 30 years. Undoubtedly, it is a product of the planned economy, adapting to the old pattern where the ownership form, circulation channels, and consumption structure were very single. Therefore, although it operated slowly and stagnantly in the past, its trajectory was clear and relatively stable, and generally, no major problems would occur.

After the reform and opening up, especially in recent years, China's economic life has undergone tremendous changes, with a dazzling spectacle being the rapid rise of the private economy. According to relevant sources, by November 1988, there were 87,000 individual households engaged in industry, commerce, and transportation in urban and rural areas of Shenyang. Their production and business activities are basically operated with cash, and they rarely use transfer checks like state-owned or collective enterprises. There is, of course, a "secret" to this. A individual household in the Five Love Street Clothing Wholesale Market in Shenhe District said: "When I go to the factory to buy goods, I pass over big bills, and the goods are loaded onto the car immediately, and the price can be discounted by one or two tenths." A driver of an individual transport household in the Nan Station area said: "Using cash to repair a car does not require queuing, and it is guaranteed to be repaired quickly and precisely, and you can save a thousand or eight hundred yuan." The convenience of cash over checks is now an open secret. The reason is simple: using checks will inevitably leave a record, while cash can "fly outside the books," allowing units to evade taxes and individuals to take a cut. In addition, banks are also lacking in service methods, with short business hours, difficulty in large cash withdrawals, often lagging half a beat behind the pace of individual household activities, which also makes many people prefer to keep the money in their hands rather than earn that bit of interest, so they can use it at any time. According to the introduction by the industrial and commercial management personnel, the general clothing retail households in Shenyang City usually have more than four or five thousand yuan of turnover cash, and the high-end clothing wholesale and retail households usually have tens of thousands of yuan of cash. Some big households often hire bodyguards to carry tens of millions of yuan back and forth between Shenyang, Guangzhou, and Shanghai. It is estimated that if the average cash held by each individual household is calculated as 4,000 yuan, then the private economy in Shenyang City alone holds more than 350 million yuan in cash, which is much more than the cash held by more than 1,000 state-owned enterprises in the city. In addition, there are about 100,000 unlicensed peddlers and workers engaged in second jobs in the city, and the amount of cash they hold in their business activities is also considerable.

Looking at the flow of residents' consumption cash, in the past, state-owned or collective commerce dominated the market, and the cash returned from commodity exchanges mostly had to be recollected to the bank. However, now private buying and selling are expanding their territory in many markets. For example, 60% to 70% of vegetables are from individual stalls throughout the year; 78% to 90% of eggs and poultry, and more than 50% of meat come from agricultural markets, and the business outlets and turnover of individual restaurants are more than ten times those of state-owned and collective enterprises. The transactions between residents and individual households are all cash transactions, thus forming another cash circulation cycle:

Individual households use cash to purchase goods → goods are put into the market to collect cash → cash is used again to purchase goods.

This "blood circulation cycle" is outside the control of the bank, and the bank has no control over it, whether it is to strictly enforce financial discipline or strengthen cash management. Not only that, this "free entity" can use legitimate means (such as individual households using the goods they put into the market to collect the cash issued by the bank for wages, bonuses, subsidies, etc.) or illegitimate means (such as helping enterprises to convert checks into cash, using cash to purchase controlled goods, etc., to draw out the cash from the enterprise), causing the "blood" inside the bank to continuously leak, while the "blood" in the extracorporeal circulation cycle continuously supplements, and the "free entity" continuously gains strength.

How to make the "blood" flowing outside the bank return to the inside? Many financial professionals are pondering:

Establish large cash savings departments to facilitate the storage and withdrawal of private business owners?

Issue more flexible cash securities than the current checks, so that individual households do not need to carry large amounts of cash and can exchange or exchange them at any time across the country?

Promote savings through loans, with more savings and more loans, to attract individual households to open accounts in the bank?

In short, the serious problem of bank "blood loss" not only reflects the problems in the current economic work but also proposes the topic of further deepening financial reform.

　　值得注意的“体外血液循环圈”
    沈阳“金融波动”思索录之二
    新华社记者  何大新  沈阳日报记者  陈大光
    银行现金锐减，同样困扰着沈阳市。据权威部门估计，目前流散在沈阳群众手中的现金高达十几亿元，约占全市现金流通总量的８０％以上。
    如果把货币流通喻为经济血脉，那么大量的现金流散在社会上，对商品量尚不充裕的市场构成一种严重威胁，而且对银行本身也是一种“失血”。由于现金缺乏，有段时间不少企事业单位连工资、奖金的发放都被迫拖延。
    面对金融界“失血”，有人瞪大眼睛在寻找票子流散的踪迹，中国人民银行沈阳分行行长、高级经济师孙学彬认为：银行之所以“失血”，除了储蓄额下降、一些企事业单位设小金库坐支等因素外，还有一个重要缘故是，在银行体外近年出现了一个新的现金循环圈。为了把问题阐明清楚，孙行长画出一个现金流程图。改革前我国消费现金的基本渠道是：
    国家（通过银行）发工资→国营或集体商店投放商品→现金回笼到银行→国家再发工资。
    孙学彬把这一循环圈称为银行直接监控下的“自体血液大循环”。这种循环，从５０年代中期社会主义工商业改造后到如今，一直沿用了３０多年。无疑，它是产品经济的产物，适应了所有制形式、流通渠道、消费结构都非常单一的旧格局，因而以往它运转起来虽然缓慢、呆滞，但轨迹清楚，比较平稳，一般不会出现大的问题。
    改革开放之后，特别是近几年来，我国经济生活万象更新，色彩纷呈，一个耀眼的景观是私营经济异峰突起。据有关人士估计，到１９８８年１１月，沈阳城乡从事工、商、运的个体户已８．７万个。他们的生产和经营活动基本上是靠现金运转，而很少像国营或集体企业那样动用转帐支票。这其中当然有“秘诀”。沈河区五爱街服装批发市场一位个体户说：“我到工厂进货，大票子刷刷点过去，货马上装车，而且价格能优惠一两折。”南站地区一个运输个体户司机讲：“用现金修汽车不用排号，保证修得又快又精，还能省下千八百块。”现金比支票灵通如今是公开的秘密，道理很简单，动用支票必然要落账，而现金可以“账外飞”，单位可漏税，个人也能抽头。另外，银行在服务方式上也欠佳，营业时间短，大额取款难，常比个体户活动的节奏慢半拍，这也使不少人宁肯不要那点利息，也要把钱放在手里，以便随时使用。据工商管理人员介绍，沈阳市普通的服装零售户一般都有四五千元以上的周转现金，高档服装批零兼干户一般都握有十万八万的现金。一些大户经常雇用保镖，携二三十万元巨款往返于沈广（广州）、沈沪（上海）之间。据估算，如果按平均每个个体户持现金４０００元计算，那么沈阳全市私营经济占有现金就高达３．５亿多元，比全市１０００多家国营企业占用的现金要多得多。此外，全市无证商贩和从事第二职业的职工总计约有１０万之众，他们在经营活动中握有的现金数额也相当可观。
    再从居民消费现金的流向观察。过去国营或集体商业一统市场，商品交换回的现金绝大多数必然要回笼到银行。而如今私营买卖在许多市场的地盘在日益扩充。如蔬菜全年６０％—７０％来自个体摊床；蛋、禽７８％—９０％、肉类５０％以上来自农贸集市，至于个体饭店的商业门点和营业额更是超过国营和集体企业十几倍。居民与个体户之间的买卖全部是现金交易，这样就出现了另一个现金循环圈：
    个体户用现金采购商品→商品投入市场收现金→现金再用于采购。
    这个“血液循环圈”游离在银行体外，银行难以监控，你严肃财经纪律也好，强化现金管理也罢，对它都毫无约束力。非但如此，这个“游离体”还能采用正当的手段（如个体户用投放的商品将银行发放出的工资、奖金、补贴等项现金收取来），或非正当手段（如帮助企业用支票套现金，用现金套购专控商品等，将企业现金引流出来），致使银行体内的“血液”不断渗漏，而体外“循环圈”的血液不断补充，“游离体”不断加肥。
    银行体外流动的“血”如何回流到体内？不少金融界人士都在深思：
    建立大额现金储蓄所，以方便私营业主存取？
    发行比现行支票更灵活的现金证券，使个体户无需腰缠万贯，可在全国各地随时通兑或交换？
    以贷促存，多存多贷，吸引个体户来银行立户？
    总之，银行“失血”严重的问题，既反映了当前经济工作中的问题，也提出了金融方面进一步深化改革的课题。
