On December 27th of last year, the public security, procuratorate, and judicial systems of the Zhengzhou Railway held a public arrest and trial meeting. They severely punished a group of criminals who disrupted railway transportation, ensuring the safety of passengers' lives and property during the winter and spring travel seasons. This public arrest involved 32 criminals; of the 42 criminals who were tried, 31 were sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment, 2 were sentenced to life imprisonment, 2 were sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve, and 7 death-sentenced criminals were immediately executed by firing squad.

In recent years, due to the significant gap between railway transportation capacity and volume, goods have been piling up, and passenger trains have been severely overcrowded. Some criminals have taken advantage of this situation to commit crimes. Some have cut communication lines, stolen vehicle parts, and looted transport materials; others have closed angle gates, placed obstacles on the tracks, and thrown stones at trains; still others have carried prohibited items on board, leading to explosions and fires on trains. In particular, violent and serious crimes and major theft cases have been on the rise. Criminals Yao Wei, Lü Zhìyīng, Xue Hongguang, and Zhou Yuxi, along with 10 others, formed a gang to steal railway transport materials at stations and cargo yards, committing 158 crimes with a value of over 80,000 yuan. The methods were despicable. Criminals Yao Wei and Lü Zhìyīng were both sentenced to death and deprived of political rights for life; criminal Xue Hongguang was sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve and deprived of political rights for life; criminal Zhou Yuxi was sentenced to life imprisonment and deprived of political rights for life; the other 10 criminals were sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment.

It is understood that the public arrest and trial meeting held by the Zhengzhou Railway public security, procuratorate, and judicial systems also set up sub-venues in Wuhan, Xi'an, Luoyang, Xiangfan, and Ankang, with more than 100,000 workers, family members, and nearby residents attending as spectators. After this meeting, more than 10,000 public security officers will go to the front lines of transportation production to comprehensively strengthen railway public security management, ensuring the safety of the lives and property of the vast number of passengers during this year's winter and spring travel seasons.

　　郑铁司法部门整顿治安
    打击犯罪保障春运安全
    本报讯  去年１２月２７日，郑州铁路公检法系统召开公捕公判大会，严厉打击一批破坏铁路运输的犯罪分子，保证冬运、春运旅客生命财产的安全。这次公捕的罪犯有３２名；公判的４２名罪犯中，３１名被判处有期徒刑，２名被判处无期徒刑，２名被判处死缓，７名死刑罪犯被立即执行枪决。
    近年来，由于铁路运输能力与运量的矛盾十分突出，货物积压，客车严重超员，一些犯罪分子趁火打劫，为非作歹。有的割断通讯线路，拆盗车辆配件，哄抢运输物资；有的关闭折角塞门，放置路障，石击列车；有的携带违禁物品上车，以致造成列车爆炸、火灾事故。特别是暴力、恶性案件和重大盗窃案件上升。姚伟、吕智英、薛红光、周玉玺等１４名犯罪分子，结伙在车站、货场等地大肆盗窃铁路运输物资，作案１５８次，价值８万多元，数额巨大，手段卑劣。罪犯姚伟、吕智英均被依法判处死刑，剥夺政治权利终身；罪犯薛红光被判处死刑，缓期２年执行，剥夺政治权利终身；罪犯周玉玺被判处无期徒刑，剥夺政治权利终身；其他１０名罪犯分别被判处有期徒刑。
    据了解，郑州铁路公检法系统联合召开的这次公捕公判大会，还在武汉、西安、洛阳、襄樊、安康５个铁路分局设立了分会场，有１０余万职工、家属和附近群众参加旁听。这次会后，将有万余名公安干警深入运输生产的第一线，全面加强铁路治安管理，确保今年冬运、春运中广大旅客生命财产的安全。
