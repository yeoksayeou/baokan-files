The stock market in New York continued to show positive trends today. The Dow Jones Industrial Average of 30 stocks rose by 13.22 points at the close of the market, reaching 2206.43 points. This is the highest point since the stock market crash in October 1987.

At the same time, the dollar's exchange rate remained strong. On the 10th, the dollar's exchange rate against the Japanese yen and the West German mark in the New York foreign exchange market rose to 1:126.30 and 1:1.8343, respectively. Today, after the market opened, the dollar's exchange rate continued to rise. To curb the rise in the dollar's exchange rate, the central banks of the United States and major Western European countries simultaneously intervened in the foreign exchange market. This is the first time they have taken coordinated action this year. Therefore, the dollar's exchange rate against the yen and the mark at the close of the market today fell to 1:125.80 and 1:1.8255, respectively.

Since the beginning of this year, both the dollar's exchange rate and the stock market have shown strong upward trends. Financial analysts here believe that this is mainly due to the positive outlook for the U.S. economy.

　　股市上扬　美元坚挺
    美国经济前景看好
    新华社纽约１月１１日电  （记者薛力敏）纽约股市行情今天继续看好。道—琼斯３０种工业股票平均指数在股市收盘时比１０日上升１３．２２点，达到２２０６．４３点。这是１９８７年１０月股市暴跌以来出现的最高点。
    与此同时，美元汇价也显坚挺。１０日纽约外汇市场上美元对日元和西德马克的比价分别上升到１∶１２６．３０和１∶１．８３４３。今天开盘后，美元汇价又趋上扬。为抑制美元汇价上升，美国和西欧主要国家的中央银行同时对外汇市场进行了干预。这是它们今年以来首次采取的一致行动。因此，美元对日元和西德马克的比价今日收盘时降到１∶１２５．８０和１∶１．８２５５。
    今年以来，美元汇价和股市均告上扬，而且势头强劲。此间金融分析家认为，主要是因美国经济前景良好。
