Title: High Voltage Power Lines Repeatedly Stolen in My Township

Edition: 5

Since November 1988, there have been 8 cases of high-voltage power lines being stolen in my township, totaling 4,000 meters of stolen wire worth over 6,000 yuan.

Some lawless elements have taken to stealing and selling aluminum wire as a means to get rich, while some purchasing departments do not question the origin of the wire and buy it all, effectively giving the green light to these lawless elements to sell their stolen goods. The three purchasing outlets of my township's supply and marketing cooperative have already purchased over 200 kilograms of aluminum wire, with some even conducting nighttime purchases. Additionally, the public security and judicial departments have not been effective in handling the cases of high-voltage wire theft.

I suggest that township and village organizations mobilize militiamen to conduct night patrols and strengthen the protection of power facilities. The public security and judicial departments, as well as the scrap purchasing departments, should work closely together. Once any individuals damaging power facilities are discovered, they should be dealt with according to the law to ensure the safety of industrial and agricultural production and the people's property.

　　我乡高压电线连续被盗
    １９８８年１１月以来，我乡连续发生８起高压电线被盗案件，共被盗走电线４０００米、价值６０００多元。
    有些不法分子把盗卖铝线当作致富的门路，而有的收购部门不问铝线来路，全部收购，为不法分子销赃开了“绿灯”。我乡供销社的３家收购门市部，现已收购铝线２００多公斤，有的还夜间收购。另外，政法部门对盗窃高压线的案件查处也不得力。
    建议乡村组织民兵深夜巡逻，加强电力设施的保护。政法部门、废品收购部门要密切配合，对破坏电力设施者，一经发现，依法处置，以确保工农业生产和人民财产的安全。
