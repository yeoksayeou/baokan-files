The revival of private economy in our country has drawn widespread attention and reflection. The book "Research on Private Economy in China's Current Stage," edited by Xue Yiqing with Jiang Zupei and Ji Jianlin as deputy editors, and published by Jiangsu People's Publishing House, is very timely.

This book dares to face reality, break through difficulties, and not only provides theoretical basis for current policies but also opens up new avenues in theoretical thinking.

Firstly, it provides a relatively systematic explanation of the status, role, and nature of private economy in China's current stage. Chapter one reviews the historical evolution of private economy since the founding of the People's Republic, and compares it with the development of private economy in the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries, enabling readers to view this economic component from a broader perspective. After clarifying the subordinate position of private economy in the socialist economy, Chapter two further argues with abundant facts that it plays an active role. Apart from the well-known aspects such as developing production, expanding employment, and increasing tax revenue, it also proposes its role in adjusting industrial structure and promoting the specialization and rationalization of social division of labor, promoting socialist competition and driving the institutional reform of state-owned and collective enterprises, and fostering the growth of managerial and technical talents. Chapter three further emphasizes that private economy is of capitalist nature but has some distinct features different from past and foreign capitalist economies in China's current stage, mainly that under the influence of public ownership economy, it has partially changed some typical characteristics of capitalist private ownership and begun to exhibit some socialist elements. In China's primary stage of socialism, developing private economy does not deviate from socialism but utilizes capitalism to build socialism.

Secondly, the book conducts a relatively in-depth and specific analysis of the production relations and operational activities of private economy. Chapters four, five, six, seven, and eight, which occupy a significant portion of the book, discuss the employment relationship, income distribution, production and operational purposes, operational forms and characteristics, and the issue of enterprise owners in private enterprises with innovative insights, significantly enhancing the book's value. Unlike the once prevalent view that denies exploitation, this book does not shy away from acknowledging that the employment relationship in private economy contains exploitation, but points out that this relationship is not equivalent to antagonistic labor-capital relations; at the same time, this exploitation is subject to the constraints of socialist economic laws. Regarding the operational behavior of private enterprises, the book conducts a specific analysis from the aspects of production, distribution, exchange, and consumption, and then categorizes the means and methods of their profit realization into two types: one is normal, such as expanding production scale, improving technological level, and enhancing management work; the other is abnormal, violating national policies and laws, and incompatible with the development of social productive forces. In the chapter on private enterprise owners, the author considers them a new force in the entrepreneurial ranks, combining productive factors, disseminating scientific and technological knowledge and commodity information, preserving and developing folk traditional crafts, and supporting public welfare causes; however, their quality needs improvement, and society should create a favorable public opinion, economic, and legal environment for their healthy growth.

Lastly, the book provides a relatively long-term outlook on the development trend of private economy, clarifying the misconception that allowing its development is merely a temporary measure. The author believes that even after significant development of productive forces, the basis for the existence of private economy in our country will not completely disappear; at the same time, its dependence on the socialist economy will become increasingly stronger. Developing productive forces is a long-term historical process, and the existence, development, and demise of private economy are also a long process. The concern about a second "private rectification" is unnecessary.

　　《中国现阶段私营经济研究》评介
    沈立人
    我国私营经济的再生，引起人们的广泛注意和思考。薛一青任主编、姜作培和季建林任副主编的《中国现阶段私营经济研究》（江苏人民出版社出版），是非常及时的。
    本书敢于面对现实，突破难点，不仅对现行政策提供了理论依据，而且在理论思维上有所开拓。
    首先，对我国现阶段私营经济的地位、作用及其性质进行了比较系统的阐述。本书第一章既回顾了建国以来私营经济演变的历史过程，又与苏联、东欧各国私有经济的发展相对比，使读者能够从大背景来正视这种经济成份。在明确私营经济在社会主义经济中的从属地位后，第二章更以大量事实比较全面地论证它的积极作用，除了大家熟知的发展生产、扩大就业、增加税收等外，还提出了它在促进产业结构的调整和社会分工的专业化、合理化，促进社会主义竞争和推动国营、集体企业的体制改革，促进经营管理人才和技术人才的成长等方面的作用，显得更加完整。第三章进而着重讲了私营经济属于资本主义性质，但在我国现阶段有其不同于过去和外国资本主义经济的一些特点，主要是在公有制经济影响下，已经部分地改变了典型的资本主义私有制的某些特征，开始带有一些社会主义因素。在我国社会主义初级阶段，发展私营经济并不背离社会主义，而是利用资本主义来建设社会主义。
    其次，对私营经济的生产关系和经营活动进行了比较深入具体的剖析。占本书很大篇幅的第四、五、六、七、八诸章，分别就私营企业的雇佣劳动关系、收入分配、生产经营目的、经营形式与特点以及企业主问题作了颇有新意的研讨，使本书大为增色。与一度流行的否认剥削的观点不同，本书并不讳言私营经济的雇佣劳动关系中含有剥削，但是指出这种关系并不等同于对抗性的劳资关系；同时，这种剥削受到社会主义经济规律的制约。对于私营企业的生产经营行为，本书从生产、分配、交换和消费四个方面作了具体剖析，然后把它实现利润的途径和手段分为两类：一类是正常的，例如扩大生产规模、提高技术水平、改善管理工作等；一类是非正常的，违背国家政策法令，与社会生产力发展不相容。在论私营企业主一章中，作者认为他们是企业家队伍中的一支新军，组合了生产力要素，传播了科学技术和商品知识，保存和发展了民间传统工艺，并赞助了公益事业；但是，他们的素质还要提高，社会要为他们的健康成长创造有利的舆论环境、经济环境和法律环境。
    最后，本书对私营经济的发展趋势进行了比较长远的展望，澄清了认为容许其发展只是权宜之计的糊涂认识。作者认为，即使在生产力有了很大发展后，我国私营经济存在的基础也不会完全消失；同时，它对社会主义经济的依附性也将越来越强。发展生产力是一个长期的历史过程，私营经济的存在、发展和消亡也是一个长过程。那种担心发生第二次“对私改造”的想法，是没有必要的。
