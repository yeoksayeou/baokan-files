Title: "Jídì" Hindered by Icebergs, Our Expedition Team Breaks Ice to Clear the Way

The "Jídì" ship continues to be blocked by the ice shelf of the Larsemann Hills, preventing it from approaching the Antarctic mainland. Currently, in front of the ship, there is a nearly 10-kilometer-wide ice belt, and within 1 kilometer of the coast, there is a row of ice mountains that seem endless like a city wall.

Experts believe that it is currently the warm season in the Antarctic, and the ice belt is melting and thinning, with ice cracks widening. If a storm arrives, it could potentially break up the ice belt and blow away the floating ice. However, from the daily Antarctic weather fax charts received, it is observed that cyclones rarely move southward, and thus, they do not affect Prydz Bay. Even if a cyclone arrives, the ice belt from the ice mountains to the coast is unlikely to be affected.

The Larsemann Hills ice shelf, under the combined effects of wind energy, solar energy, and tidal energy, will split and drift away at an unpredictable date. The Chinese East Antarctic expedition team must depart by ship on March 5, as the harsh Antarctic winter will soon arrive. Obviously, the situation facing this expedition team is becoming increasingly dire. They must either yield to the obstruction of the Larsemann ice shelf or choose the path of scientific exploration. The expedition team decided to forge ahead despite the difficulties, organizing an assault team to use steel picks and hammers to break the ice, opening a passage for the barge to unload supplies and establish a station.

　　“极地”号受阻冰山
    我考察队凿冰开道
    新华社拉斯曼丘陵１月３日电（记者张继民）我国“极地”号船继续受到拉斯曼丘陵陆缘冰的阻挡，不能靠近南极大陆。目前，横陈在这艘船面前的，除近１０公里宽的冰带外，靠海岸１公里的冰带上，还有一列城墙般不见尽头的冰山。
    有关专家认为，目前，正值南极暖季，冰带在融化变薄，冰缝也在加宽，若风暴来临，有可能颠碎冰带、吹走浮冰。但从每天收到的南极天气传真图中发现，气旋很少向南移动，影响不到普里兹湾。即便气旋到来，冰山至海岸的冰带很难受到冲击。
    拉斯曼丘陵陆缘冰在风能、太阳能、潮汐能的综合作用下，分裂和漂走的日期谁也难以预料。而中国东南极考察队３月５日乘船返航的时间是不容推迟的，因为届时酷冷的南极寒季将至。显然，这支考察队所处的局面越来越严峻，要么屈服于拉斯曼陆缘冰的阻拦，要么选择科学探险的道路。考察队决定迎难前进，组织突击队用钢钎戳、铁锤砸等方法破冰，打开一条供驳船卸运物资建站的航路。
