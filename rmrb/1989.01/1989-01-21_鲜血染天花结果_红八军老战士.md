On January 7th, I accompanied the surviving members of the original Red Seventh and Eighth Armies to watch the Guangxi-produced artistic television documentary "Deng Xiaoping in Guangxi." Seeing the past storms and struggles again, I was deeply moved and couldn't help but compose a poem on the spot:

	With a brush, I write the history of war,
	In prosperous times, compiling books is a necessity.
	Blood stains the sky, and the results bloom,
	For thousands of years, people will deeply know.

　　鲜血染天花结果
    红八军老战士
    吴西
    元月七日，余偕同原红七、八军幸存者看广西摄制的艺术性电视文献纪录片《邓小平在广西》，再睹昔日风雨历程，感触万端，情不自禁，即席吟诗一首——
    挥毫但写战争史，
    盛世修书显必需。
    鲜血染天花结果，
    千秋万代人深知。
