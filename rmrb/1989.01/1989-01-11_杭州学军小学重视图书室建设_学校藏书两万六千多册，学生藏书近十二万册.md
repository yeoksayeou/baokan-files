Hangzhou Xuejun Primary School, which has been repeatedly named a national and provincial, municipal, and district-level advanced unit for reading, places great emphasis on library construction. The school has a collection of 26,619 books, and students collectively own nearly 120,000 books.

This primary school currently has 19 classes and 55 faculty and staff members. It has a 50-square-meter reading room. The school subscribes to 102 newspapers and magazines and purchases a certain number of new books each year. This year, it bought 3,371 new books. The librarian often holds new book exhibitions and promptly publishes new book catalogs to facilitate students borrowing books.

The library also features a "Newspaper Reading Corner" and a "Quiz Corner." This year, it launched the "Love for Chinese Land" and "Lu Xun Memorial Award" reading activities.

During holidays such as Children's Day, National Day, and the Spring Festival, when parents give students more pocket money, the school encourages them to use this money to buy books, fostering a reading culture. On average, each student owns more than 170 books. To improve the utilization rate of personal books, each Pioneer squad sets up a book box, with some squads having more than 250 books in their boxes. Each semester, the school formulates a reading plan and conducts 1-2 well-prepared and researched reading guidance classes, inviting all relevant teachers to attend. The teachers jointly research how to teach reading guidance classes with different content for students of different grades and levels, making the reading guidance scientific and effective.

　　杭州学军小学重视图书室建设
    学校藏书两万六千多册，学生藏书近十二万册
    本报讯  记者王娜梅报道：多次被评为全国及省、市、区读书先进单位的杭州市学军小学，十分重视图书室的建设，共藏书２６６１９册，学生藏书１１９８７５册。
    这所小学目前有１９个班，５５位教职工，拥有一个５０平方米的阅览室。他们订阅了１０２种报纸杂志，每年都要添置一定数量的新书。今年又购书３３７１册。图书馆老师经常举办新书展览，及时公布新书目录，以方便学生借书。
    图书室还开辟了“阅报栏”、“考考你”栏，今年又开展了“热爱中华大地”、“鲁迅纪念奖”读书活动。
    每逢“六一”、“国庆”、“春节”等节假日，家长给学生零花钱较多，学校就提倡他们用这些钱买书，形成风气。每人平均拥有图书１７０余册。为提高个人图书的利用率，少先队各中队都设立了图书箱，有的中队图书箱有图书２５０册以上。每个学期，学校都制订阅读课计划，上１至２节有准备、有研究的阅读指导课，组织全校有关老师听课。教师们共同研究如何根据不同年级、不同层次的学生上好不同内容的阅读指导课，使阅读指导科学化、见实效。
