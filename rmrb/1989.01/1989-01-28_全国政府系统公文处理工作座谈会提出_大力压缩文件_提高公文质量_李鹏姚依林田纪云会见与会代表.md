The National Government System Document Processing Work Symposium proposes to reduce documents and improve quality. Li Peng, Yao Yilin, and Tian Jiyun meet with attendees.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 27th - Premier Li Peng told the representatives of the National Government System Document Processing Work Symposium, which concluded this afternoon, that document processing work is very important. If this work is done well, it can strengthen the government's connection with the people, accelerate the transmission and feedback of information, and improve government work efficiency.

Li Peng and Vice Premiers Yao Yilin and Tian Jiyun met with the symposium representatives this afternoon at Zhongnanhai.

The symposium, convened by the General Office of the State Council, proposed to significantly reduce the number of documents, strictly enforce the implementation of documents, and free various levels of leaders from the "mountain of documents."

According to the meeting, the main problems in document processing are the excessive number of documents and poor quality, as well as the poor implementation of important documents and feedback of important information.

Secretary of the State Council, Luo Gan, demanded at the meeting to strive to improve the quality of document processing work, increase work efficiency, and closely focus on implementing the Party Central Committee and the State Council's series of deployments on rectifying the economic environment, rectifying economic order, and comprehensively deepening reforms.

The reporter learned from the meeting that last year, the General Office of the State Council received 5,284 requests from various regions and departments, an increase of 500 compared to 1987; over 3,000 reports and situation reflections; and various bulletins, materials, etc. Vice Secretary of the State Council, Bai Meiqing, believes that in the request documents, a considerable number of issues can be resolved by various regions and departments within their authority. Some meetings have a large number of materials and bulletins that serve no purpose. Some documents are verbose, with long introductions before addressing the substantive issues. He said that too many documents and long lengths waste the leaders' energy and manpower, material resources, and financial resources.

Bai Meiqing said at the meeting that this year, we must seriously address the reduction of documents. Documents that can be issued or not issued should be firmly not issued; issues that can be discussed orally or resolved by phone should not be documented. Except for important meetings, professional meeting bulletins should be greatly simplified. Various regions and departments should conduct a thorough cleanup of their own "bulletins" and "situation reflections," merging some and canceling others.

Bai Meiqing proposed to work hard to improve document quality and not to produce shoddy work or fill in the gaps. Only in this way can various levels of leaders be freed from the "mountain of documents," allowing them more time to delve into practical issues, engage with the people, and do a good job in various aspects of work.

Government office heads and secretaries from various provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government, and municipalities with separate plans, as well as relevant heads from central state organs, attended the three-day symposium.

　　全国政府系统公文处理工作座谈会提出    
    大力压缩文件　提高公文质量    
    李鹏姚依林田纪云会见与会代表
    新华社北京１月２７日电（记者胡清海）国务院总理李鹏对今天下午闭会的全国政府系统公文处理工作座谈会的代表说，公文处理工作很重要，这项工作做好了，能加强政府与群众的联系，加速信息的传递和反馈，提高政府工作效率。
    李鹏和国务院副总理姚依林、田纪云下午在中南海会见了座谈会的代表。
    由国务院办公厅召开的这次座谈会提出，要大力压缩文件，狠抓文件的贯彻落实工作，把各级领导干部从“文山”中解脱出来。
    据会议反映，文件过多而质量不高，重要文件的落实和重要情况的反馈较差，是当前公文处理中存在的主要问题。
    国务院秘书长罗干在今天的会上要求努力提高公文处理工作的质量，提高工作效率，紧紧围绕贯彻执行党中央、国务院关于治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序、全面深化改革的一系列部署，做好办公厅工作。
    记者从会上了解到，去年，国务院办公厅收到各地区、各部门的请示件共５２８４件，比１９８７年增加５００件；报告和情况反映３０００多件；还有各种简报、资料等等。国务院副秘书长白美清认为，在请示工作的文件中，有相当一部分问题是可以由各地区、各部门按职权范围负责解决的。有些会议，材料、简报一大堆，起不了什么作用。有些文件夹叙夹议，“穿靴带帽”，写了很长一段才接触实质问题。他说，文件太多，篇幅太长，牵涉了领导同志很多精力，浪费了人力、物力、财力。
    白美清在会上说，今年要认真抓一下压缩文件。可发可不发的文件，坚决不发；能口头商量、电话解决的问题，就不必行文。除了重要会议以外，专业会议的简报要大大精简。各地区、各部门对自己办的“简报”、“情况反映”等要进行认真清理，有的合并、有的取消。
    白美清提出，要下功夫提高公文质量，决不可粗制滥造，滥竽充数。这样才能把各级领导干部从“文山”中解脱出来，以便有更多时间深入实际，深入群众，做好各项工作。
    各省、自治区、直辖市和计划单列市的政府办公厅负责人、秘书长和中央国家机关的有关负责人，出席了为时３天的座谈会。
