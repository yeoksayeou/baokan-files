To further advance the cause of socialist reform, the Polish United Workers' Party has decided to undertake a profound reform of the party itself.

This decision was made in the resolution passed at the early hours of today by the Polish United Workers' Party's Tenth Central Committee Plenum. The full text of the resolution was broadcast tonight by the Polish News Agency.

The Central Committee Political Bureau of the Polish United Workers' Party submitted a draft on "Party Reform as a Condition for the Success of the Reform and Renewal Strategy" to the Tenth Central Committee Plenum in December last year. The plenum, which reconvened today, summarized the discussions of the previous stage and adopted the resolution.

According to the resolution, the reform of the Polish United Workers' Party will include the following:

	* Decisively changing its tasks, organizational structure, and methods of work to effectively play the role of the party in Poland's pluralistic society and socialist market economy;
	* No longer monopolizing state power and administrative and management agencies, but achieving the party's goals and tasks through the work of party members in these institutions;
	* Effectively implementing democratic centralism within the party, that is, fully exercising democracy in seeking programmatic schemes and in discussions or debates, and strictly adhering to discipline in taking action and implementing resolutions;
	* Requiring all party organizations to conduct extensive discussions within the party and consultations outside the party before making major decisions;
	* Completely adopting democratic methods to replace or select party cadres, introducing competitive mechanisms into party elections;
	* Enhancing the role of the parliament and local people's assemblies, and expanding the scope of coalition governance;
	* Strengthening the coalition governance of the Polish United Workers' Party, the United Peasants' Party, and the Democratic Party, and working together with various social organizations to unite all social forces that advocate reform, abide by the law, and safeguard the national interests of Poland to promote national reconciliation;
	* Implementing the policy of freedom of belief.

The first secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, Jaruzelski, won the vote of confidence from the attendees at the secret session of the Tenth Central Committee Plenum held today.

According to the Polish News Agency, Jaruzelski requested a vote of confidence from the plenum after some members of the Central Committee expressed disagreement with two documents submitted by the Political Bureau to the Central Committee Plenum. The two documents discussed by the plenum involved the self-reform of the Polish United Workers' Party and its stance on political pluralism and trade union pluralism.

The secret session was held from 8 PM yesterday to 3 AM today. Jaruzelski made two speeches at the meeting, explaining the intentions of the Political Bureau and the Secretariat. Finally, he raised the issue of holding a "vote of confidence." He declared that if he did not receive the support of the Central Committee Plenum, he would resign from his position as the first secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party and the chairman of the Council of State of Poland. At the same time, he was authorized to announce that several other members of the Political Bureau, including Prime Minister Rakowski, Minister of Internal Affairs Kiszczak, and Minister of Defense Siwicki, would also resign from their party and government positions if they did not receive the vote of confidence.

Under the insistence of Jaruzelski that the Central Committee Plenum should vote, with the exception of four abstentions, the plenum unanimously expressed confidence in the Political Bureau led by Jaruzelski. Subsequently, the plenum unanimously adopted the resolution of the meeting. However, the documents on political pluralism and trade union pluralism were only passed after repeated revisions.

　　波党决定对自身进行改革
    十中全会通过对雅鲁泽尔斯基信任投票
    据新华社华沙１月１８日电  为了进一步推进社会主义革新事业，波兰统一工人党决定对党的本身进行深刻的改革。
    这个决定是在今天凌晨通过的波兰统一工人党十中全会决议中作出的。波通社今晚播发了决议的全文。
    波党中央政治局去年１２月向十中全会提交了关于《党内改革是革新和改革战略取得成功的条件》的提纲。这次十中全会续会对前一阶段讨论作了总结，并通过了决议。
    根据决议，波兰统一工人党的改革将包括下列内容：
    ——坚决地改变自己的任务、组织机构和活动方式，以便有效地发挥党在波兰多元化社会和社会主义市场经济条件下的作用；
    ——不再包揽国家权力、行政和管理机关的工作，通过党员在这些机构的工作来实现党的目标和任务；
    ——在党内有效地贯彻民主集中制，即在寻求纲领性方案、在讨论或争论时应最充分地发扬民主，而在采取行动、执行决议时应最严格地遵守纪律；
    ——要求所有党组织在作出重大决定前必须在党内进行广泛的讨论并在党外进行协商；
    ——完全采用民主方式更换或选拔党的干部，把竞争机制引入党内选举工作；
    ——发挥议会和地方人民会议的作用，扩大联合执政的范围；
    ——加强波兰统一工人党、统一农民党和民主党的联合执政，与各种社会团体联合行动，团结一切主张改革、遵守法律和维护波兰国家利益的社会力量，以促进民族谅解；
    ——落实信仰自由的政策。
    新华社华沙１月１８日电　（记者汤德乔、董福生）波兰统一工人党中央第一书记雅鲁泽尔斯基在今天举行的波党十中全会秘密会议上，赢得了与会者的信任投票。
    据波通社报道，雅鲁泽尔斯基是由于一些中央委员对政治局提交中央全会的两个文件表示异议之后而要求全会举行信任投票的。政治局提交全会讨论的两个文件涉及到波兰统一工人党的自身改革以及对政治多元化和工会多元化问题的立场。
    秘密会议从昨天晚上８时举行到今天凌晨３时。雅鲁泽尔斯基在会上曾２次发言，解释政治局和书记处的思想意图。最后他提出了举行“信任投票”的问题。他声明，如果得不到中央全会的支持，他就辞去党中央第一书记职务以及波兰国务委员会主席的职务。同时他还被委托宣布，另外几名政治局委员，其中包括总理拉科夫斯基、内务部长基什查克和国防部长西维茨基，如得不到信任，也准备辞去他们所担任的党内外职务。
    在雅鲁泽尔斯基坚持要求中央全会进行表决的情况下，除４人弃权外，全会对以雅鲁泽尔斯基为首的中央政治局一致表示信任。随后，全会一致通过会议决议。但是关于政治多元化和工会多元化问题的文件则在反复修改后才得以通过。
