Minister of the Ministry of Personnel Zhao Dongwan Answers Questions from Reporters

The State Council's "Three Definitions" Plan Approved
Staffing Quotas Reduced by Nearly 10,000 Compared to Pre-Reform Numbers

Beijing, January 5th — Reporter Chen Weiwei reports: Organizational reform is an important part of China's political system reform and a major concern for all sectors of society. Today, the reporter conducted a special interview with Minister of the Ministry of Personnel Zhao Dongwan on the progress of the State Council's organizational reform.

Zhao Dongwan introduced that after the Seventh National People's Congress, the State Council's organizational reform mainly focused on vigorously promoting the transformation of government functions, reducing government interference in enterprise operations, strengthening macro-control functions, and initially changing the unreasonable organizational setup and low administrative efficiency. From April to June last year, the focus was on establishing nine new ministries and commissions and carrying out the "Three Definitions" (defining responsibilities and tasks, defining organizations, and defining staffing quotas) work. After June, the focus was on carrying out the "Three Definitions" work for other departments. Now, the task of reallocating functions and adjusting organizations has basically been completed, and the work of various departments has returned to normal operation.

When asked about the main achievements of the State Council's organizational reform, Zhao Dongwan mentioned five points: First, with the core of separating government from enterprises and separating administration from management, the transformation of functions has been implemented, weakening the government departments' direct intervention in enterprise micro-management, and strengthening the macro-management functions of economic departments. Second, supervision and control departments have been strengthened, and professional departments have been streamlined and weakened. Third, based on the transformation of functions, organizations have been reasonably set up, and staffing quotas have been determined. The State Council's ministries and commissions have been reduced from the original 45 to 41, direct institutions from the original 22 to 19, temporary institutions from the original 75 to 44, and internal bureau-level institutions within departments have been reduced by approximately 20%. The staffing quotas after the State Council's organizational reform are reduced by 9,700 compared to the actual number of personnel before the reform, accounting for 19.7% of the original number. Fourth, a number of issues of overlapping and duplicate functions between departments have been resolved, with 40 issues resolved through consultation and 6 issues currently being coordinated for resolution. Fifth, pilot work for deepening organizational reform has been carried out, creating certain conditions for gradually implementing the national civil servant system.

Finally, Zhao Dongwan talked about the next steps for organizational reform. He said that to consolidate the achievements of organizational reform and maintain the stability of the organizations, the focus of the State Council's work this year will be on establishing new operating mechanisms for agencies, straightening out relationships, and improving work efficiency. The key is to further implement the transformation of functions and implement the "Three Definitions" plan. Specific tasks include: First, organize inspections to implement the transformation of functions, strictly manage organizations, staffing quotas, and leadership positions, solve new problems encountered in the operation of new functions and new organizations, and properly arrange surplus personnel. Second, gradually establish organizational and staffing regulations, manage according to law, consolidate reform achievements, and strengthen institutional building within departments to clarify procedures and work rules. Third, further straighten out the relationship between the State Council's various departments and local governments, and clarify the powers of the State Council's various departments and local governments. Powers that need to be centralized at the central level must be centralized and not dispersed, and powers that need to be delegated should not be retained. Fourth, do a good job of defining and rectifying the direct institutions of various departments. Fifth, carry out pilot work for the socialization of office services, further streamline the organizational and staffing quotas of agencies, and consolidate and develop the achievements of organizational reform.

　　人事部部长赵东宛答记者问
  　国务院“三定”方案审议完毕     
    人员编制比改革前实有人数减少近万人
    本报北京１月５日讯  记者陈维伟报道：机构改革是我国政治体制改革的一项重要内容，是各界人士关心的一件大事。今天，记者就国务院机构改革的进展情况，专题采访了人事部部长赵东宛。
    赵东宛介绍说，去年七届人大一次会议之后，国务院的机构改革主要是大力推进政府职能的转变，减少政府干预企业经营活动的职能，增强宏观调控职能，初步改变机构设置不合理和行政效率低的状况。从去年４月到６月，重点抓了９个新部委的组建与“三定”（定职责任务、定机构、定编制）工作，６月以后，主要是进行其它部门的“三定”工作。现在，整个职能的重新配置和机构调整的任务已基本完成，各部门的工作均已进入正常运转。
    当记者问到国务院机构改革的主要成效时，赵东宛谈了五点：一是以政企分开、政事分开为核心，落实了职能转变，弱化了政府部门直接干预企业微观管理的职能，强化了经济部门的宏观管理职能。二是加强了监督与调控部门，精简和削弱了专业部门。三是在转变职能的基础上，合理设置机构，确定了编制。国务院部委从原有的４５个减为４１个，直属机构从原有的２２个减为１９个，非常设机构从原有的７５个减为４４个，部门内设司局级机构减少约２０％。国务院机构改革后的人员编制比改革前实有人员总计减少９７００多人，占原有人数的１９．７％。四是解决了一批部门之间职能交叉、重复的问题，这一类问题经协商解决的有４０个，正在协调解决的有６个。五是进行了深化机构改革的试点工作，为逐步实行国家公务员制度创造了一定的条件。
    最后，赵东宛谈了下一步机构改革的任务。他说，为了巩固机构改革成果，保持机构的稳定性，今年国务院的机构主要是在建立机关新的运行机制，理顺各方面关系，提高工作效率上下功夫。重点是进一步落实职能转变，落实“三定”方案。具体任务，一是组织验收，通过验收落实职能转变，同时要严格机构、编制与领导职数的管理，解决新职能新机构在运转中遇到的新问题，还要妥善安排好富余人员。二是逐步建立机构编制法规，做到依法管理，巩固改革成果，同时，各部门内部管理，也要加强制度建设，明确办事程序和工作规则。三是进一步理顺国务院各部门与地方政府的关系，划清国务院各部门与地方政府的事权。需要集中在中央的权力必须集中，不能分散，需要下放的权力，不能截留。四是搞好各部门直属事业单位的核定与整顿工作。五是进行推行机关后勤服务社会化的试点，进一步精干机关机构编制，巩固和发展机构改革的成果。
