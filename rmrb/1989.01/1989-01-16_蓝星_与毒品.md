Recently, a columnist in Venezuela revealed that a type of drug disguised as stickers popular among children and teenagers has entered the Venezuelan market, drawing significant attention from parents and relevant authorities.

This sticker, called "Blue Star," is secretly sold at some newsstands in the United States. It appears as a white paper with several star-shaped images the size of an eraser, featuring beloved characters like Mickey Mouse, Superman, and butterflies. These star-shaped images can be applied to the skin as temporary tattoos. However, these "Blue Stars" contain a highly dangerous drug: LSD.

LSD, or lysergic acid diethylamide, is a potent hallucinogen. Ergot is a fungus that parasitizes grains. It is said that in the past, people who ate bread made from flour contaminated with ergot fungus experienced neurological disorders. Later, during the study of this fungus, LSD was isolated. LSD can enter the body through ingestion or skin pores, and even a small dose can induce hallucinations. These hallucinations can sometimes produce a sense of euphoria, but they can also cause extreme terror, even leading to suicidal thoughts. More seriously, this neurological disorder is incurable and irreversible. Prolonged use can lead to blindness. Several cases of selling these stickers have been discovered in the United States. A hospital in the U.S. has issued a pamphlet to warn parents and teenagers about the dangers of "Blue Star." In Venezuela, some young people have already fallen victim. According to reports, a young man, after using LSD for three consecutive days, jumped from the roof of a building and committed suicide.

Currently, relevant departments in Venezuela are still investigating "Blue Star" and similar drugs, and are calling on the public to report any cases. They are also urging parents to educate their children not to purchase these items.

　　“蓝星”与毒品
    本报记者  朱满庭
    最近，委内瑞拉一位专栏作家披露，一种伪装成儿童和青少年喜欢的贴画的毒品已进入委内瑞拉市场，引起了家长和有关部门的极大重视。
    这种叫作“蓝星”的贴画在美国一些报摊上偷偷出售。它的样子是在白纸上带有几个橡皮头大小的星状物，星星上有米老鼠、超人、蝴蝶等孩子们喜爱的形象。这些星状图像可以贴印在皮肤上，作纹身图案。但这些“蓝星”却带有对人体危害极大的毒品：ＬＳＤ。
    ＬＳＤ，全称麦角复酸二乙酰胺，是一种烈性致幻剂。麦角是一种真菌，寄生在禾类植物上。据说，以前人们吃了带有黑麦麦角菌的面粉做的面包，就曾发生过神经错乱的病症。后来，人们在研究这种真菌时，分离出了ＬＳＤ。ＬＳＤ可以通过口服或皮肤上的毛孔进入人体，只要一点点剂量就可使人产生幻觉。这种幻觉有时会产生飘飘欲仙的快感，有时则令人感到恐怖异常，甚至产生自杀念头。更严重的是这种神经错乱无法医治和康复。服用多了还能导致双目失明。在美国已经发现几起出售这种贴画的案例。一家美国医院为此专门印发小册子，提醒家长和青少年别上“蓝星”的当。在委内瑞拉，已有一些青年落入圈套。据报道，一名青年因为连续３天服用ＬＳＤ，结果从房顶上跳了下去，自杀身亡。
    目前，委内瑞拉有关部门仍在追查“蓝星”一类毒品，并呼吁社会积极报案，同时要求家长教育子女不要买这种玩意儿。
