Reform has injected vitality into China's early childhood education sector. Currently, collectively and individually operated kindergartens are increasingly common. A relevant official from the State Education Commission stated today that kindergartens relying more on collective and individual efforts will become the main trend in the development of China's early childhood education.

This official said that early childhood education has local and mass characteristics, and it is neither possible nor appropriate for the state to handle everything alone. Instead, it should be a joint effort involving the state, collectives, and individuals. Statistics show that out of the 18.54 million children currently enrolled in kindergartens, more than 60% are in various privately run kindergartens. In Shanghai, 90% of children previously attended kindergartens run by the education department, but now out of the 500,000 children enrolled, 270,000 attend kindergartens run by various units and street committees. By mobilizing the enthusiasm of all sectors of society, the problem of children having difficulty enrolling in kindergartens has been alleviated. Currently, the enrollment rate for children in urban areas of Shanghai has reached 100%, and in suburban counties, it has reached 93%. It is understood that nationwide, individually operated kindergartens are on the rise, and this trend is particularly prominent in coastal and economically developed regions.

Regarding the widespread concern about improving the quality of kindergarten education, the relevant official from the State Education Commission said that the education department has the responsibility and obligation to provide business guidance and teacher training for kindergartens at all levels. She pointed out that the education department providing business services and teacher training for collectively and individually operated kindergartens represents a significant shift in the guiding ideology of kindergarten management post-reform. At the same time, she mentioned that currently, China has only 67 kindergarten teacher training schools, and in 1987, out of nearly 700,000 kindergarten teachers nationwide, only about 20% had received more than one year of training. Therefore, the task of training kindergarten teachers is quite heavy. Additionally, this official revealed that last year, the enrollment rate for preschool-aged children nationwide was 26%, and the problem of difficulty in enrollment is still far from being solved. She believes that through reform, mobilizing the enthusiasm of all sectors of society to develop early childhood education will be an effective way to address this issue.

　　改革为幼儿教育事业发展注入活力
    全国６０％入园幼儿在民办幼儿园中
    新华社北京１月１４日电（记者赵卫）改革为我国幼儿教育事业的发展注入了活力。目前我国集体、个人办的幼儿园日益增多。国家教委有关负责人今天说，幼儿园更多地依靠集体和个人来办将成为我国幼儿教育事业发展的主趋势。
    这位负责人说，幼儿教育事业具有地方性和群众性，不可能也不应该由国家包起来，要由国家、集体、个人一起来办。一项统计数字表明，目前我国已入园的１８５４万幼儿中，６０％以上是在各种民办的幼儿园中。上海市过去９０％的入园幼儿都在教育部门开办的幼儿园中，现在全市５０万名入园幼儿中有２７万在各单位和街道办的幼儿园。由于调动了社会各方面的积极性，幼儿入园难的状况得到缓解。目前上海城区幼儿入园率已达１００％，郊县达到９３％。据了解，全国现在个人办的幼儿园呈增长趋势，在沿海和经济较发达地区这种情况尤为突出。
    对广大群众关心的提高幼儿园的教育质量的问题，国家教委有关负责人说，教育部门有责任、有义务对各级各类幼儿园进行业务指导和为其培训师资。她指出，教育部门为集体、个人办的幼儿园提供业务服务并为其培训师资，这是改革后在办园指导思想上的一大转变。同时她说，目前我国只有６７所幼儿师范，而１９８７年全国近７０万幼儿教师中受过一年以上培训的只占２０％强，所以培训幼儿师资的任务相当重。此外，这位负责人透露，去年全国适龄幼儿的入园率为２６％，入园难的问题还远未解决。她认为，通过改革调动社会各方面的积极性发展幼儿教育事业，将是解决这一难题的有效途径。
