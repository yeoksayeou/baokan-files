In Beixingtou Village, Changxing Township of our county, people often see an elderly man over seventy years old delivering newspapers and mail to every household. He is Wang Bingfu, a retired cadre and Communist Party member.

Over the past five years, Old Wang has handled 28,000 newspapers and 3,000 pieces of mail, never making a single mistake. Once, an urgent telegram was sent from Changzhi City, requiring the recipient to go to Changzhi that day. Despite the slippery roads in the snow, Old Wang ran three or four kilometers to find the recipient.

Old Wang is not only a volunteer delivery person but also a newspaper propaganda worker. Over the years, he has insisted on timely extracting economic information and successful experiences from the newspapers and sharing them with his fellow villagers. He also often reads the newspaper to everyone, promoting the benefits of subscribing to newspapers. Even though the price of newspapers has increased significantly, the number of newspaper subscriptions in this village continues to rise.

　　乡村送报人
    在我县常行乡北行头村，人们经常看到一位年过七旬的老人，在挨门挨户为村民传送报刊和邮件。他，就是离休干部、共产党员王丙富。
    ５年来，老王收发报刊２．８万多份，邮件３０００多件，从来没有出过差错。一次由长治市发来一封急电，要求收报人当天赶往长治，老王不顾雪天路滑，跑了三四公里路，终于找到了收报人。
    老王不仅是个义务投递员，还是报刊宣传员。几年来，他坚持将报刊上的经济信息、致富经验及时摘录下来，告诉乡亲们。他还经常给大家读报，宣传订报的好处。眼下，尽管报刊大幅度调价，可这个村订报的数量还有增加。
