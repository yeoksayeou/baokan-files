Deru County Investigates and Punishes Disciplinary Violations to Promote Clean Government in Party and Government Agencies

	The People's Daily reports: Deru County in Hebei Province has taken the initiative to investigate and punish disciplinary violations to promote clean government in party and government agencies. Last year, the county investigated and punished 21 party members and cadres who violated discipline. Among them, 4 were expelled from the party, 8 received a party probationary punishment, 4 received a serious party warning, 5 received a party warning, and over 160,000 yuan was confiscated and returned.

	The county has overcome the problem of "the people do not report, the officials do not investigate." They regularly analyze and study the cases reported by the people in letters and visits, holding a joint meeting every quarter with the participation of the disciplinary inspection, audit, supervision, procuratorate, financial, and public security departments to timely understand the clues of the cases. Since this year, they have conducted 6 major inspections focusing on the issue of clean government in party and government agencies. After the investigation and punishment, 208 advanced party organizations and 293 outstanding party members emerged in the county who "add glory to the party flag."

　　迁西查处违纪干部
    促进党政机关廉洁
    本报讯  河北省迁西县从查处案件入手促进党政机关廉洁。去年全县有２１名违纪的党员干部受到查处，其中被开除党籍的４名，受留党察看处分的８名，党内严重警告４名，警告处分５名，收缴退赔款１６万多元。
    该县克服“民不举，官不究”的弊端，定期分析研究人民群众来信来访中举报的案件，每季召开一次由纪委、审计、监察、检察、金融、公安部门参加的联席会议，及时了解案件线索。今年以来，围绕党政机关廉洁问题，进行了６次大检查。查处后全县涌现出“我为党旗添光彩”活动先进党组织２０８个，优秀共产党员２９３名。
