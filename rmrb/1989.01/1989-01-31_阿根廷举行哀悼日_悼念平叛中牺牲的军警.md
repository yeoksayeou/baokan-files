According to an order by President Raúl Alfonsín, flags were flown at half-mast nationwide, and commercial, sports, and entertainment activities were suspended for the day.

To commemorate the soldiers and police who died in the battle, President Alfonsín announced on the day the rebellion was suppressed that a day of mourning would be held on January 29.
