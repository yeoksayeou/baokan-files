The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party and the Regional Government of Handan recently issued a notice, severely handling the mistake made by Zheng Fulian, deputy county head and member of the government party group of Ci County, for seriously violating the family planning policy by having a fourth child over the quota and concealing it for a long time.

According to the *Handan Daily*, in 1983, when Zheng Fulian was serving as the deputy director of the Ci County Committee Office, he disregarded the Party's family planning policy and had a fourth child over the quota. To cover up his mistake, Zheng Fulian claimed to outsiders that the child was picked up by his cousin Zheng Fulin and entrusted the child to another cousin, Zheng Fucang, for fostering. He formed an alliance with Zheng Fulin, Zheng Fucang, and others to conceal the matter from the organization for a long time. Zheng Fulian's actions caused public discontent. Since 1983, based on public exposure, relevant departments have sent people to investigate several times, but due to Zheng Fulian's transfer and concealment of the child, he refused to admit the mistake. In December 1988, the Regional Committee sent a joint investigation team for further investigation. With substantial evidence, the main leaders of the Ci County Committee and the county government had multiple talks with Zheng Fulian, criticizing and educating him, repeatedly explaining the Party's policy, and only then did Zheng Fulian admit his mistake to the organization.

To uphold Party discipline and government regulations, after research and discussion by the Ci County Committee, the Standing Committee of the People's Congress, and the People's Government, and with the approval of the Regional Committee and the Regional Government, Zheng Fulian was given the punishment of expulsion from the Party, removal from the position of deputy county head, and dismissal from public office with a one-year probation period.

　　转移隐匿超生儿　历时五年终败露    
    磁县副县长郑福良生四孩受处分
    新华社石家庄１月２６日电  河北省邯郸地委、邯郸地区行署最近发出通报，对磁县副县长、政府党组成员郑福良严重违反计划生育政策，超计划生育第四胎，并长期隐瞒的错误行为作出严肃处理。
    据《邯郸日报》报道，１９８３年，郑福良任磁县县委办公室副主任期间，无视党的计划生育政策，超计划生育第四胎。为掩盖错误，郑福良对外称小孩是其堂兄郑福林拣来的，并把孩子寄托另一堂兄郑福堂代养。他与郑福林、郑福堂等人订立攻守同盟，长期向组织隐瞒此事。郑福良的错误行为引起了群众不满。１９８３年以来，根据群众揭发，有关部门几次派人调查，都因郑福良将小孩转移、隐匿，拒不承认。１９８８年１２月，地委派联合调查组进一步调查，在掌握大量证据的情况下，磁县县委、县政府的主要领导同志先后多次找他谈话，对其进行批评教育，反复讲明党的政策，郑福良才向组织承认了错误事实。
    为严明党纪政纪，经磁县县委、县人大常委会、县人民政府研究决定，并报地委、行署批准，给予郑福良开除党籍、撤销副县长职务和开除公职留用察看一年的处分。
