Title: New York "Aged"

Recently, Central Television broadcasted a news item: a six-story building on West 32nd Street in New York suddenly collapsed. Prior to this, incidents of water pipe bursts and bridges being closed due to long-term neglect have also been reported in New York. All of this indicates that as a world metropolis, New York has "aged."

Visitors to New York often complain: the roads are uneven; the subway shakes severely; water pipes frequently burst, and the entire city's infrastructure is severely aged.

In 1898, the original New York City, which was just Manhattan Island, expanded to include areas like Brooklyn, the Bronx, Queens, and Staten Island, forming Greater New York. The roads built and water pipes laid around this time are now over a century old.

New York City's roads have a history almost as long as asphalt paving, so half of them need repair. The city government allocates $200 million annually for road repairs, but this only covers 1/40 of the roads that need fixing each year. In other words, the roads that need repair now will take 40 years to fix. However, by the time they are repaired, many more roads will have joined the list of those needing repair.

The situation with bridges is similar. Including dry bridges, New York has about 2,000 bridges, half of which need repair or reconstruction. Currently, about 10 bridges are completely closed, and 20 bridges have parts of their surfaces closed. In mid-April 1988, the Williamsburg Bridge was closed due to severe corrosion of its suspension cables. Even the busiest bridge, the Manhattan Bridge, can only be partially open. Of the 76 bridges over water in New York, most were built at the end of the last century or the beginning of this one. The Brooklyn Bridge over the East River was built in 1883, while the Williamsburg Bridge and the Manhattan Bridge were built in 1903 and 1909, respectively.

Water pipe bursts are also common. In 1987 alone, there were 600 such incidents! Severe bursts occur two or three times a year.

The water pipes currently in use in New York are all made of cast iron and were mostly laid in the 1920s. A small portion was laid before 1870.

Mayor Koch has promised to actively repair roads and bridges. He guarantees that in the next 10 years, $450 million will be allocated for road repairs and another $140 million for repairing 300 severely damaged bridges. However, the city's transportation bureau clearly points out that the funding gap is huge!

Due to a shortage of municipal engineering funds, the New York Transportation Bureau is considering measures such as tolls, vehicle registration taxes, gasoline taxes, and tire taxes, but these proposals are difficult to get approved by the city council. Without money, how can they repair roads and bridges? The relevant U.S. agencies responsible for budget allocations always prioritize politically significant projects, leaving municipal projects at the back of the line. With no money, the municipal side has no choice but to cut staff. For example, when the Brooklyn Bridge was first completed, there were 200 people dedicated to its maintenance and repair. Now, there are only 160 bridge maintenance workers for the entire city. Without necessary maintenance and repair, won't this accelerate the aging of municipal facilities? The New York municipal department has vowed to repair all roads and bridges by the end of this century, but it seems quite challenging.

### 纽约“老”了

　　纽约“老”了
    毕清
    前不久中央电视台播放了一条消息：纽约西３２街一幢六层楼的建筑物突然倒塌。此前，纽约发生水管破裂、桥梁因年久失修而禁止通行的事也时有所闻。这一切表明，作为世界大都会的纽约已经“老”了。
    外来者到纽约大多都啧有烦言：道路高低不平；地铁摇晃严重；水管开裂频仍，整个纽约的基础设施严重老化。
    １８９８年，原来仅是曼哈顿岛的纽约市，又加入了布鲁克林、布隆克斯、皇后等区和斯坦登岛，从而形成了大纽约。在此前后兴建的道路、铺设的水管，有些已是“百岁老人”了。
    纽约市的道路几乎拥有和沥青铺路同样长的历史，因此有一半的道路需要修复。纽约市政府每年拿出两亿美元修复道路，每年只能修好所需修复道路的１／４０。也就是说，现在待修的道路需４０年才能修好。而早在修完以前，又有许多道路会排在待修表上。
    桥梁情况也相似。包括旱桥在内，纽约共有约２０００座桥梁，其中也有一半需整修乃至重建。如今约有１０座桥梁完全不能通行，２０座桥梁部分桥面禁止通行。１９８８年４月中旬，威廉斯堡桥因吊桥的钢缆严重受腐蚀而关闭。连交通量最大的曼哈顿桥也一直只能部分通行。纽约市架在水面上的７６座桥梁中，大多建于上个世纪末或本世纪初，而东河上的布鲁克林大桥则建于１８８３年，威廉斯堡桥和曼哈顿桥分别建于１９０３年和１９０９年。
    自来水管破裂更是常事，１９８７年一年竟多达６００次！而严重的破裂情况每年也有两三次。
    纽约目前使用的水管，均为铸铁所制，大多都是２０年代铺设的，其中的一小部分则是１８７０年以前铺下的。
    纽约市长科奇表示要积极抢修道路和桥梁。他保证在今后１０年中拿出４５亿美元来修路，另用１４亿美元修复损毁严重的３００座桥梁。然而，该市的交通局明确指出，资金缺口大得很呢！
    由于市政工程经费短缺，纽约交通局想采取过桥收费、征收汽车登记税、汽油和轮胎税等措施，但这些建议难以为市议会批准。没有钱怎么修路修桥？负责预算拨款的美国有关机构又总是以政治问题为主的项目拨下经费，市政项目老是排不上队。市政方面没有钱，不得已只能裁减人员。如布鲁克林大桥刚完成时有２００人专门负责维修保养这座大桥，而如今全纽约的桥梁维修工仅为１６０人。缺乏必要的维修保养，岂不又加速市政设施的老化？纽约市政部门虽发誓要在本世纪内修复所有的路桥，但看来有些勉为其难。
