Recently, a reporter visited the talent market for graduates of "Zhongda (Central Radio and TV University), Yedai (Evening University), Yedaxue (Night School), Zhida (Vocational School), and Handa (Correspondence School)" in Zhuzhou City, Hunan. The reporter deeply felt the troubles and losses caused to people and society due to the mismatch between talent cultivation and social demand.

"Initially, I blindly pursued a diploma, and now I am tasting the bitter fruit," said a 23-year-old graduate of Zhongda, Xiao Liu, at the talent market. She majored in auditing and, after graduating in July, contacted several units, but they all said they did not need this type of talent. This time, hearing that the city had specially opened a talent market for graduates of the "Five Big" schools, she came to register with high hopes, but after five days of activity, she left disappointed. It was not just Xiao Liu; in this talent market, dozens of graduates in Chinese, secretarial, legal, and auditing fields from the "Five Big" schools were rarely approached by any units.

In stark contrast, graduates in mechanical, chemical, and construction fields from the "Five Big" schools were in high demand. Eight university graduates in industrial trade and international economics were all hired on the first day the market opened.

Such a stark contrast could not help but make graduates of the "Five Big" schools, both those who have already graduated and those who are currently studying, reflect: after the introduction of the competitive mechanism in the talent market, was their choice of major appropriate?

A certain factory has a workshop where, out of more than fifty workers, eight are Zhongda graduates majoring in prices. In fact, in a factory with tens of thousands of people, only a few people are needed to handle prices. Street-level and township enterprises do not have such detailed divisions of labor, and pricing and accounting are often combined. Therefore, in recent years, this city will definitely not be short of talent in the pricing field. This situation reminds people: if the choice is not organically combined with social needs, it will only result in unnecessary waste. Of course, educational institutions should also set up majors with a focus, so that the talents they cultivate can truly be put to use.

### “五大”毕业生反思——专业选择要适应社会需求

　　“五大”毕业生反思——
    专业选择要适应社会需求
    日前，记者采访了湖南株洲市“电大、业大、夜大、职大、函大毕业生”人才市场，深感由于人才培养和社会需求不一致带给人们的苦恼及给社会造成的损失。
    “当初盲目追求文凭，如今备尝了苦果。”在人才市场上，二十三岁的电大毕业生小刘这样对记者说。她学的是电大审计专业，今年七月毕业后联系了好几个单位，人家都说不缺这类人才。这次听说市专门为“五大生”开办人才市场，她便满怀希望来登记，可活动了五天，结果失望而归。不独小刘一人，在这个人才市场上，中文、秘书、法律、审计等专业几十名“五大生”，几乎很少单位问津。
    与此形成鲜明对照的是，机械、化工、建筑等专业的“五大生”则供不应求。八个工业贸易、国际经济专业的大学生，在开业第一天就被录用一空。
    如此强烈的反差，不能不引起已毕业的和正在就读的“五大生”的深思：竞争机制引入人才市场之后，自己的专业选择是否得当？
    某厂有个车间，五十多个工人就有八个上物价专业的电大生。其实，成千上万人的工厂，管物价的只需要几个人，街道企业和乡镇企业还没有那么精细的分工，物价、财会往往合在一起。因此近几年这个市紧缺的决不会是物价专业人才。这种状况提醒人们：选择如果不与社会需要有机地结合，只会造成无谓的浪费。当然，办学单位也应有针对性地设置专业，使自己培养的人才能够真正派上用场。
