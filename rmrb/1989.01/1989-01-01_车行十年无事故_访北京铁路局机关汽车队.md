Traffic accidents are known as the world's number one public hazard. In 1987, 500,000 people worldwide died in traffic accidents, 50,000 in China, and 600 in Beijing. However, the Beijing Railway Bureau's motor pool has driven 3.2 million kilometers accident-free over the past ten years and has been recognized as a model for traffic safety in Haidian District and Beijing City for ten consecutive years. The reporters visited this motor pool. Zhang Zhenbin, the team leader who is nearly sixty, told the reporters: The team has 30 people and 41 vehicles. This 3.2 million kilometers is the result of everyone's hard work.

The Discipline is Strict

The 30 men in the team are all heavy drinkers; yet, for ten years, no one has had a drop of alcohol during work hours, not even beer.

Zhang, known as someone who can't walk straight after drinking, has seniority and is well-liked, so he has many opportunities to drink. However, he has never broken the team's rules. Once, while entertaining guests, a bottle of "Maotai" was placed in front of him, and the bureau leader urged him, "Old Zhang, this is a rare opportunity, have a drink!" He swallowed his saliva but never picked up the glass. Zhang is now retired, but everyone still remembers his refusal to drink "Maotai." The team leader and safety officer often remind everyone: Drinking excessively is a matter of life and death.

The team has a rule that vehicles must be driven back to the team after leaving Beijing and cannot be parked at home or elsewhere. No one dares to be careless about this. Even in the middle of the night, the car must be driven back, and then they can ride a bicycle or walk home. The team also has a rule that drivers must not delay the time of the vehicle users, they can only wait for people, not let people wait for the car. Moreover, they treat leaders and ordinary people the same.

The team also has a rule that drivers must dress neatly, be polite, and not lose their temper while on duty. All new young drivers must cut their hair short and shave their beards. The team says bluntly, if you can do it, you stay; if you can't, you leave.

The Hearts are Soft

Shi, a driver with 20 years of experience, never took rules and regulations seriously when he worked for other units. He thought they were just pieces of paper hanging on the wall. After being transferred to the Beijing Railway Bureau's motor pool, he felt the difference. A small incident had a great impact on him: On the first snow day of 1987 winter, he opened the car door to prepare for the trip and saw a note on the dashboard that read, "Weather changes, be careful." He never thought the leaders would think so carefully. This is for whom? He told himself: I must drive safely!

Some drivers in other units, relying on their steering wheels, have rough language and bad tempers, and are known as "driver bosses." Vehicle users have to be very careful, but the drivers in this team have good tempers and soft hearts.

One night, drivers Chen Changzheng and Li Wanxue were on duty at the team when they suddenly received a call: A person had collapsed on the road outside the West Gate, and they were asked to send a car for emergency assistance! The two immediately set out and arrived to find that the person had a heart attack. They knew that heart attack patients should not be moved, so they quickly drove to a nearby hospital to bring a doctor and rescue equipment. Because of the timely rescue, the patient was saved. Later, the patient's family came to the team to express their gratitude for saving their life.

To help drivers focus on driving, the team leaders do their best to solve their problems. Some drivers live far from work, so they try to adjust their schedules. Some live in single-story houses or feel unsafe, so they help install iron bars on the doors and windows. During the winter when cabbages are stored, to avoid drivers waiting in long lines to buy vegetables and delaying their work, the team buys all the cabbages for the team and distributes them to each family. Some drivers go out on duty and cannot return by the end of the workday, so the team leader or other team members help pick up their children, take them home, or bring them to the team to take care of. These drivers gratefully say: Our old team leader is also a "nanny."

Party Members Lead the Way

Driving in the bureau, although the income is less than driving a taxi outside, the drivers in this team have not "jumped ship." Why? The drivers say: The team has its attractions!

In this team of 30 people, there are 18 Communist Party members, and 85% of them are rated as advanced every year. Party members take the lead, and leaders set an example, which is recognized in the team. In addition to the old team leader Zhang Zhenbin, the leaders of the team do not take leave and are both leaders and drivers. They also run those difficult routes and do those less profitable jobs. The team requires drivers to start work at 7:30 AM, but the leaders have insisted on starting work at 7:00 AM for many years, arriving half an hour earlier. Zhang Zhenbin suffers from arthritis but still insists on starting work early and finishing work late. Sometimes the team distributes fruits, vegetables, etc., and the team leaders always let the drivers take them first and take the remaining ones themselves.

This team has 8 young people who have written applications to join the Party. The reporter asked a young driver: In the team, joining the Party and getting promoted and making money are not "connected," and sometimes you even suffer losses. Why do you still want to join the Party? He said, I look at the party members in the team and admire them. People should have some pursuit, some spirit. How can one only seek promotion and make money!

The honor of ten years without accidents is hard-earned, but they are even more humble and cautious: To maintain the honor, one must still drive one kilometer at a time.

　　车行十年无事故
    ——访北京铁路局机关汽车队
    本报记者  李德民  张铭清
    交通事故，被称为世界第一公害。１９８７年全世界５０万人死于交通事故，中国有５万人轮下丧生，北京市达６００多人。而北京铁路局机关汽车队，１０年安全行车３２０万公里，连续十年被评为海淀区和北京市的交通安全先进单位。记者慕名采访了这个车队。年近花甲的队长张振斌告诉记者：车队有３０人，４１台车，这３２０万公里，是大伙一个轱辘一个轱辘转出来的。
    纪律真严　　
    车队３０条汉子，论喝酒都是“海量”；可是，１０年来，上班时间谁也没沾一滴酒，啤酒也不例外。
    张师傅人称是“见了酒走不动路的人”，他资格老，人缘好，喝酒的机会真不少，可是，他从没破车队的规矩。有一次，接待单位摆上了“茅台”，局领导劝他：“老张，机会难得，喝一杯！”他咽了口唾沫，始终没端酒杯。张师傅现在已经光荣退休了，大家都还记着他不喝“茅台”的事。队长和安全员时常提醒大家：贪杯，是要以生命为代价的。
    车队规定，汽车在京出车后，必须开回车队不准开回家或者停在其他地方。这一条，谁也不敢马虎。即便是深更半夜，也得把车开回来，然后骑自行车或步行回家。车队还规定，不准耽误用车人的时间，只准车等人，不准人等车。而且对领导同志和一般同志一个样。
    车队还规定，司机上班时要着装整齐，态度文明，礼貌，不准发脾气。凡是新来的青年司机，一律剪短头发，剃掉胡子，丑话说在前头，做得到您就留下，做不到您另请高就。
    心肠真软　　
    石师傅是位开过２０年车的老司机，在外单位开车时，从来不把规章、制度当回事，认为那不过是贴在墙上的几张废纸而已。调到北京铁路局机关汽车队后，他感到就是不一样。有件小事对他震动很大：１９８７年冬第一场大雪那天，他打开车门准备出车，看见仪表台上有条纸条，写着“天气变化，注意安全”。他真没想到领导想得这样细，这是为谁呢？他暗中告诫自己：一定得安全行车！
    有些单位的司机仗着手中的方向盘，口气粗，脾气大，人称“司机爷”，用车同志得处处陪小心，可是这个车队的司机，脾气好，心也软。
    有天晚上司机陈长征、李万学在车队值班，突然接到一个电话：西大门外有一个人昏倒在马路上，请出车急救！他们二人立即出车，赶到一看，原来是心脏病发作的病人，他们知道心脏病人不能挪动，便赶紧驱车赶到附近医院请来医生，拉上抢救器械，因为抢救及时，病人脱险了。事后，病人全家到车队感谢救命之恩。
    为了使司机集中精力开车，车队的领导千方百计为他们解除后顾之忧。有的司机住家比较远，他们就想办法调一调，有的住平房或一层楼感到不安全，他们帮忙在门窗上加铁栏杆。到了冬贮大白菜的季节，为了避免司机排长队买菜耽误出车，车队就把全队的白菜统一买回来，分送各家。有的司机出车了，到下班时间还回不来，队长或其他同志就帮他接孩子，送到家或领到车队哄着。这些司机感激地说：我们老队长还当“老保姆”。
    党员带头
    在机关开车，虽然比在外面开出租车收入少，但这个车队的司机没有“跳槽”的。为什么？司机们说：车队有吸引力！
    这个车队３０人中有１８名共产党员，每年有８５％党员评上先进。党员带头，领导当表率，在车队是公认的。车队的领导除了老队长张振斌之外都不脱产，既当领导，又是司机，而且要跑那些不好跑的路段，干那些“油水”不大的活。车队要求司机上午７时半上班，而领导多年来坚持７时上班，早到半小时。张振斌患关节炎，也坚持早上班迟下班。车队有时分点水果、蔬菜什么的，队领导总是让司机先拿，自己拿剩下的。
    这个车队有８个青年同志写了入党申请书。记者问一位青年司机：在车队入党和升官发财都不“挂钩”，有时还吃亏，您为什么还要求入党呢？他说，我看着车队的党员，心中佩服，人，总得有点追求，有点精神，做人哪能光图升官发财！
    十年无事故的荣誉来之不易，但他们更谦虚谨慎：要保持荣誉，还是得一个轱辘一个轱辘转下去。
