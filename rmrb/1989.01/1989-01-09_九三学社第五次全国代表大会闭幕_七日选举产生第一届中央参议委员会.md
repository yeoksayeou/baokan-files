The Fifth National Congress of the Jiusan Society concluded this afternoon.

The resolution of the congress pointed out that China's current science, technology, education, and medical and health services face many difficulties and hidden dangers. It is necessary to deepen the reform of the science and technology and education systems; increase investment, improve scientific research and educational conditions, raise the status of intellectuals, and create a good social atmosphere of respecting knowledge and talent. The Jiusan Society is determined to make greater contributions to the development of China's science and technology and education. The congress believes that it is necessary to gradually strengthen the role of democratic parties in the National People's Congress, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and the government, and to adhere to and improve the system of multi-party cooperation. Democracy and science are the fine traditions and glorious banners of the Jiusan Society, powerful weapons against feudalism, autocracy, and ignorance. In the period of socialist modernization, they have particularly important significance.

Vice Chairman of the Jiusan Society Central Committee Hao Yichun delivered the closing speech. She hoped that all members would play a role in the country's political life, support and promote reform, and strive for national reunification and the rejuvenation of China. The closing ceremony was presided over by Chairman of the Jiusan Society Central Committee Zhou Peiyuan.
