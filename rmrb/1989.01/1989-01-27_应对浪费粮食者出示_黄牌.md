	The per capita grain ration in our country is very low, and every year a considerable amount of foreign exchange is spent on importing a portion of grain to supplement and enrich the supply. However, it is strange that in some places, while they are calling out for grain shortages, there is also a significant amount of grain being wasted. In some places, many people have a very weak sense of saving grain, and some units turn a blind eye to the serious problem of grain wastage. This is a problem that deserves attention. This letter to the editor again sounds the alarm on the issue of grain wastage.

	— Editor

	Editor,

	Recently, I participated in a survey of grain consumption in several units in the urban area of Chengdu with the Sichuan Urban Survey Team. I found that the phenomenon of grain wastage is very serious. I think it is necessary to show a yellow card to these units to reverse this heartbreaking situation.

	We surveyed 13 units, including schools, factories, restaurants, and government agencies. When we entered the canteens of these units, we could see a layer of white rice scattered on the dining tables and the surrounding floor. Two universities, with an average of about 12,000 teachers and students eating in the canteen each day, estimated that nearly a thousand jin of grain is wasted daily. Another university wastes about 13% of the canteen's daily grain supply. Factories, government agencies, hotels, and restaurants also frequently waste grain. A hotel with over 200 beds and a government agency with over a hundred people eating each day both waste several jin to several dozen jin of rice and flour daily.

	It is understood that the reasons for grain wastage are manifold: First, there is a lack of regular propaganda and education, and many people, especially young people, are indifferent to planned and frugal grain consumption. Second, the grain supplied by the grain department is of poor quality, with many impurities in the rice, affecting normal consumption. Third, the culinary techniques for meals need improvement. Some college canteens use large boxes to steam rice, and because the rice is not washed clean, the surface layer of the boxed rice is often wasted.

### 应对浪费粮食者出示“黄牌”

　　应对浪费粮食者出示“黄牌”
    我国人均口粮占有量很低，每年还要花相当多的外汇进口一部分粮食，以调剂和充实供应。但奇怪的是，有些地方一边喊粮食短缺，一边却存在大量浪费粮食的现象。在一些地方，许多人节约粮食的观念十分淡薄，有些单位对严重浪费粮食的现象熟视无睹。这是个值得重视的问题。这篇来稿，又给浪费粮食的现象敲了警钟。

　　编辑同志：
    最近，我随四川城市调查队对成都市区一些单位的粮食消费情况进行调查，发现浪费粮食的现象十分严重。我以为有必要对那些单位出示黄牌警告，以便扭转这种痛心的局面。
    我们调查的包括学校、工厂、饭店和机关１３个单位。当我们走进这些单位的食堂，便可看到抛撒在餐桌和附近地上一层白白的大米饭。有两所大学平均每天在食堂就餐的师生约１．２万人，负责膳食管理的人员估计，平均每天浪费粮食近千斤。还有一所大学，每天被浪费掉的粮食约占食堂当日用粮的１３％。工厂、机关、招待所、饭店浪费粮食的现象也屡见不鲜。一个有二三百个床位的招待所，有上百人进餐的机关，每天都有几斤、几十斤的米面被扔掉。
    据了解，浪费粮食现象的出现，有多方面的原因：一是缺乏经常性的宣传教育，不少人，特别是青年人对计划用粮、节约用粮十分淡漠。二是粮食部门供应的粮食品质差，大米中的谷稗杂质多，影响正常食用。三是膳食的烹饪技术有待改进。一些大专院校的食堂采用大盒蒸饭，由于大米淘洗不净，盒饭表层大多被浪费了。
