Snow on the streets of Moscow has bent the tree branches, and the squares are adorned with Christmas trees lit up with colorful lights. "Winter Old Man" and "Snow Maiden" beckon passersby from shop windows, and long queues form in front of street stalls selling gifts and New Year's goods. Children stick plastic blow-up snakes on their rosy cheeks, and everywhere there is a festive atmosphere of welcoming the New Year.

In front of the Pushkin Square, readers, as usual, gather around the newsstands of the *Moscow News*. People here love to discuss major events.

"What are the things that made you happy this year?" the reporter asked.

"A few things," a teacher replied calmly, listing the achievements in Soviet domestic and foreign policies. "We withdrew from Afghanistan, the Soviet Union and the United States began to destroy intermediate-range missiles, the 19th Party Congress proposed political reforms, economic reforms deepened... Oh, and our relations with our great neighbor, China, have improved further."

"According to our Chinese saying, it's a good year for the dragon!"

"But according to the Soviet people, a leap year is a year full of events," a worker wearing a Chinese down jacket chimed in. "Just the hijacking of planes happened twice, ethnic conflicts in Transcaucasia, Estonia's push for independence, the earthquake in Armenia... The reforms aren't going smoothly either, and they haven't brought us many benefits."

Now, as the Soviet people reflect on the year that is about to pass, they no longer like to view reality through rose-colored glasses as they did in the past. This year, the Soviet Union has conducted a profound reflection on its past policies and actions: a series of historical injustices have been rectified; it has been realized that military force cannot solve the Afghan problem, and a decision has been made to withdraw troops; it has been understood that national strength does not primarily rely on military power, and a decision has been made to unilaterally reduce troops by 500,000; the essence of the socialist economy is not "big and public"; within one year, the number of individual laborers has increased to more than 600,000, and the output value of cooperatives has almost increased tenfold; Soviet-foreign joint ventures have developed from a few to more than 160, and free economic zones have also been established; in the 15 years before the reform, the net increase in agricultural output was not as much as the agricultural investment, and a decision has been made to rely on policies and changes in production relations to revitalize agriculture and solve the food problem.

In the process of exploration, there have been some detours, such as the improper arrangement of state orders when implementing the state-owned enterprise law, which turned into a disguised mandatory task, and the anti-alcohol campaign went too far and had adverse effects. However, all these deviations have been corrected in a timely manner.

The Soviet society is constantly innovating through reflection and exploration: political system reforms have taken new steps, separating party and government, separating legislation and execution, limiting the term of office for leaders, giving more autonomy to local authorities, and even the previously mysterious Foreign Ministry, KGB, and Ministry of Internal Affairs have begun to introduce their work to the public, increasing transparency. The disaster relief work for the Armenian earthquake also broke the rules: American military aircraft delivered relief supplies to the Soviet Union without Soviet guidance, Western rescue team members entered Soviet territory without visas, allowed Armenian soldiers to temporarily visit their families, and were demobilized early...

In front of the state-run department store next to Red Square, a worker from another city who had been standing in line for an hour to buy chocolates said, "The supply has not improved, and in many places, meat and sugar are still rationed." A woman standing in line to buy leather boots complained, "There are fewer affordable and good-quality items. A decent pair of women's boots costs more than half a month's salary."

As *Izvestia* political observer Bovin put it, "The economic situation is improving slowly, and this year is a year of walking on a tightrope between hope and disappointment." Economist Agambejyan put it more vividly: "This is because the pit we have to climb out of is deeper than we expected, and the pit walls are steeper than we imagined."

What to do? The Soviet people are thinking and debating. An old soldier who participated in the Great Patriotic War said, "You can't keep flipping through old history books, debating, holding meetings, and demonstrating. Do you support Gorbachev's reforms? Fine, then do it for real!"

"According to your Chinese saying, is the Year of the Snake good or bad?" a young man asked the reporter.

"The Soviet sinologist said that the snake is the embodiment of wisdom."

"Good, we will become wiser in 1989 and come up with more ingenious reform measures!"

　　反思　探索　革新
    ——苏联人回顾一九八八年
    新华社记者  盛世良
    莫斯科街头积雪压弯了树枝，广场上一棵棵新年枞树彩灯闪烁，“冬老人”和“雪姑娘”从商店橱窗里向行人招手，出售礼品和年货的街头商亭前排起了长队，孩子们把刚买到的塑料吹气蛇贴在红扑扑的脸上，到处充满了迎接新年的气氛。
    普希金广场上《莫斯科新闻》报栏前像往日一样围满了读者，来这里的人最爱议论天下大事。
    “今年有哪些令人高兴的事？”记者问。
    “我们从阿富汗撤军，苏美开始销毁中程导弹，第１９次党代会提出了政治改革措施，经济改革深化……对了，同我们伟大的邻邦——中国的关系进一步改善。”一位教员不慌不忙地列举了苏联内政外交的成就。
    “照我们中国的说法，龙年大吉呀！”
    “可是照苏联人的说法，闰年是多事年”，一位穿中国羽绒服的技工接过话头，“光是劫持飞机就发生两起，外高加索民族冲突，爱沙尼亚闹独立，亚美尼亚地震……改革也不顺利，没给我们带来多少好处。”
    苏联人如今在回顾即将过去的１年时，已经不喜欢像过去那样透过粉红色眼镜看现实。这一年，苏联对过去的政策和行动进行了深刻反思：一系列历史冤案得到平反；意识到武力解决不了阿富汗问题，下决心撤军；懂得了国家强盛主要不靠军事威力，决定单方面裁军５０万；社会主义经济的实质并不是“一大二公”；１年内，个体劳动者发展到６０多万，合作社产值几乎增加１０倍；苏外合资企业从几个发展到１６０多个，还建立了自由经济区；改革前的１５年农业产值的净增额还不及农业投资大，决心靠政策，靠改变生产关系来振兴农业，解决食品问题。
    在探索过程中有时也走了些弯路，如执行国营企业法时国家订货安排不当，变成了变相的指令性任务，反酗酒斗争过了头产生副作用等，但都及时纠正了偏差。
    苏联社会在反思和探索中不断革新：政治体制改革迈出了新步伐，党政分开，立法与执行分权，限制领导职务任期，给地方以更大自主权，连过去神秘莫测的外交部、克格勃和内务部也开始向公众介绍自己的工作，增强了透明度。亚美尼亚地震的救灾工作也打破常规：美国军用飞机未经苏联人领航把救灾物资送到苏联，西方抢险队员无需签证登上苏联国土，允许亚美尼亚籍士兵临时探家，提前复员……
    在红场旁的国营百货公司门前，为买巧克力排了一小时队的一位外地工人说：“供应不见改善，不少地方肉与糖凭票供应。”排队买皮靴的一位妇女抱怨说：“价廉物美的东西少了，像样的女靴要花费半个月以上的工资。”
    用《消息报》政治观察家鲍文的话来说，“经济形势好转姗姗来迟，今年是在希望和失望间走钢丝的一年”。经济学家阿甘别吉扬说得更形象：“这是因为我们要爬的坑比预计的深，坑壁比设想的陡。”
    怎么办？苏联人在思考、争论。一位参加过卫国战争的老军人说得好：“不能没完没了地翻历史老帐、辩论、开会、示威。你支持戈尔巴乔夫的改革？行，实打实地干！”
    “照你们中国的说法，蛇年好不好？”一个小伙子问记者。
    “苏联汉学家说了，蛇是智慧的化身。”
    “好，我们在１９８９年会变得更加聪明，会想出更妙的改革措施！”
