	The Worries of a Bountiful Harvest
     Gao Shuhua, Xu Xianguo

	In the "Beidahuang" region, there is a family farm run by Ju Hongchang. Last year, he harvested over 5,000 mu of grain and beans, achieving a bumper harvest.

	The 859th Farm in the Heilongjiang Reclamation Area calculated for him: the 4,000 mu of soybeans currently being harvested can yield at least 360,000 kilograms. Adding the 120,000 kilograms of wheat already in hand, the total output value can reach 350,000 yuan, with a net profit of at least 100,000 yuan.

	However, this "farming expert" and "farm owner" does not seem happy. He came to this farm from Shanghai in 1969, working as a statistician and agricultural technician, and has never been as worried and exhausted as he is now running a family farm. At this moment, facing the account of a net profit of 100,000 yuan, he has other thoughts and worries.

	The Heilongjiang Reclamation Area, where Ju Hongchang is located, began establishing worker family farms in 1985. Land is contracted to households, and agricultural machinery is transferred to workers at market prices. Workers have transformed from mere producers to producers and operators, significantly improving labor efficiency. However, on the other hand, the risks of agricultural disasters, social burdens, and the recent price increases of agricultural production materials, originally borne by state-owned farms, have been transferred to the workers. The more than 160,000 worker family farms that have been established are facing increasingly heavy burdens.

	Since 1985, Ju Hongchang has been the manager of a family farm. He now has 3 tractors, 1 harvester, and matching tools, employing 14 workers year-round, making him a major grain producer in Beidahuang. However, the larger the production scale, the greater the risk of agricultural disasters. In the past two years, his income has remained roughly the same. In 1987, due to severe flooding, 3,000 mu of soybeans were almost completely lost, resulting in a loss of 243,000 yuan.

	This year, although Ju Hongchang had a bumper harvest, even if he adds the value of his current fixed assets—130,000 yuan worth of agricultural machinery—the positive and negative values cancel each other out, leaving an absolute value of zero. Four years of hard work have been in vain!

	Ju Hongchang is eagerly hoping to improve production conditions to increase the agricultural insurance factor. The land he contracts is in the low-lying marshland of the Ussuri River, where it floods nine out of ten years. However, currently, there are 80 million mu of such flood-prone land and 120 million mu of drought-prone land in the Heilongjiang Reclamation Area. Improving the production conditions of these farmlands is not only beyond the reach of the newly established worker family farms but also beyond the current economic strength of the state-owned farms. On one hand, the state's investment in agriculture in the reclamation area is decreasing year by year. During the "Sixth Five-Year Plan" period, the average annual state budget investment in the reclamation area decreased from 150 million yuan during the "Fifth Five-Year Plan" period to 72 million yuan. Last year, it was only 50 million yuan, and the original budget allocation for agriculture was changed to loans. On the other hand, the state has determined a shortage of 700 million yuan in working capital for agricultural reclamation enterprises, making it difficult for most farms to maintain simple reproduction, let alone improve production conditions.

	What threatens Ju Hongchang's family farm is not only the risk of agricultural disasters but also the increasingly heavy social burdens and the endless price increases of agricultural production materials...

	State-owned farms not only engage in production and construction but also in administrative and social construction. In 1987 alone, the 101 state-owned farms in the Heilongjiang Reclamation Area bore policy-related and social burdens totaling 330 million yuan for public security, civil affairs, people's armed forces, education, culture, health, and transportation. Each mu of land in family farms pays 24.02 yuan in profit, taxes, and fees, which is 15.12 yuan more per mu than the burden on farmers in Heilongjiang Province.

	In particular, the recent price increases of agricultural production materials have not only offset the benefits brought by grain price increases to family farms but have also raised the comprehensive cost per mu of agriculture from 28.5 yuan in 1978 to 61.24 yuan in 1987.

	The Jiangchuan Farm has a family farm run by Wang Jin, who left 300 mu of farmland uncultivated last year. The reason was that spring flooding made it difficult to prepare the land, and the high-yield period had passed without sowing. If sowed, it would definitely result in a loss. A farm official said, "In the past, farming was done regardless of profit or loss, but now it is commercial production. Who would want to farm if they know they will lose money?" The Qianjin Farm has a development-oriented family farm with over 2,000 mu of farmland, planning to sell all its agricultural machinery after the autumn harvest and seek other businesses.

	Fortunately, Ju Hongchang has not yet considered leaving the land and abandoning farming. He wants to try his luck again and places all his hopes on 1989, hoping for a good year with favorable "heaven, earth, and man."

　　丰收忧思录
     高淑华　徐先国
    “北大仓”有个叫居洪昌的家庭农场，去年播种的５０００余亩粮豆喜获丰收。
    他所在的黑龙江垦区八五九农场为他算了一笔账：正在收获的４０００亩大豆少说可以打３６万公斤，加上已经到手的１２万公斤小麦，总产值可达３５万元，他至少获纯盈利１０万元以上。
    但这位被称为“种田能手”的“农场主”似乎并不快乐。他１９６９年从上海下乡来到这个农场，当过统计和农业技术员，还从未像现在办家庭农场这样操心、费力。此时，面对着纯盈利１０万元的账，他却另有所思、另有所愁。
    居洪昌所在的黑龙江垦区，从１９８５年开始兴办职工家庭农场，土地承包到户、农机具作价转让给职工，职工由过去的单纯生产者变为生产经营者，劳动效益明显提高。但另方面，原属国营农场承担的农业灾害性风险、社会负担以及近几年农用生产资料涨价等因素也转移到职工身上，已经兴办起来的１６余万个职工家庭农场负担越来越重。
    居洪昌从１９８５年开始成为家庭农场场长，现有拖拉机３台、收割机１台及配套农具，常年雇工１４人，堪称北大荒的种粮大户。然而，生产规模越大，承担的农业灾害性风险越大。前两年，他收益基本持平。１９８７年由于遭受严重涝灾，３０００亩大豆几乎绝产，他一下子亏损挂账２４．３万元。
    今年居洪昌虽获丰收，但即便将现有的固定资产——价值１３万元的农机具全部加上，正数与负数相抵，绝对值仍是个零。４年的血汗等于白流！
    居洪昌在急切地盼望着改善生产条件，以增大农业保险系数。因为他承包的耕地属乌苏里江低谷沼泽地带，十年九涝。但目前他所在的黑龙江垦区有这样的易涝地达８００多万亩、易旱地１２００万亩。要改善这些耕地的生产条件，不仅刚办起的职工家庭农场无力办到，就目前的国营农场经济实力看，也无法办到。一方面，国家给垦区的农业投资在逐年减少。“六五”期间，国家预算内平均每年给垦区的投资，已由“五五”期间的１．５亿元减少到０．７２亿元。去年只有０．５亿元，还把原来对农业的预算内拨款改为贷款。另方面，国家对农垦企业核定的流动资金缺口达７亿元。使得多数农场维持简单再生产已很困难，改善生产条件实在力不从心。
    威胁着居洪昌家庭农场的不仅是农业灾害性风险，还有日益加重的社会负担和农用生产资料没完没了的涨价……
    国营农场不仅要进行生产建设，还要进行政权和社会建设。仅１９８７年黑龙江垦区的１０１个国营农场承担的公检法、民政、人民武装、教育、文化、卫生、交通等政策性、社会性负担就达３．３亿元。家庭农场每亩上交的利润、税金，费用高达２４．０２元，与黑龙江省的农民亩负担相比，竟高出１５．１２元。
    尤其是近几年农用生产资料涨价，不仅吃掉了粮食提价给家庭农场带来的好处，而且使农业综合亩成本由１９７８年的２８．５元提高到１９８７年的６１．２４元。
    江川农场有个叫王金的家庭农场，去年有３００亩耕地弃而不种。原因是春涝重整地难，过了高产期还未播上种。如果种上非亏损不可。一位农场干部说，过去种地不管盈亏，现在商品生产，明知亏损谁愿种？前进农场有个拥有２０００余亩耕地的开发性家庭农场，打算秋收后卖掉全部农机具，另谋他业。
    值得庆幸的是，居洪昌还没有离土弃农的打算。他想再碰碰运气，并把全部希望寄托在１９８９年，盼着今年的“天时、地利、人和”。
