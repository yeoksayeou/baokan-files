Chen Mu Hua, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Chairman of the Financial and Economic Committee, said today that China will continue to strengthen cooperation with all countries in the world, encouraging foreign investors to establish more wholly-owned enterprises in China and more joint ventures that utilize China's old enterprises to introduce foreign capital, advanced technology, and management experience.

Chen Mu Hua made these remarks this evening when she met with a delegation from the Finance and Treasury Committee of the Italian Senate, led by Vice Chairman Deqing Kui. The delegation, composed of senators and prominent figures from the economic and financial sectors, is the first foreign parliamentary delegation to be received by the National People's Congress this year.

Chen Mu Hua pointed out that since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Italy in 1970, cooperation in the political, economic, trade, and cultural fields has been significantly strengthened. The cooperation and exchanges between the two countries' parliaments and specialized committees have played an active role in promoting friendly cooperation between the two countries. In the future, the path of cooperation between China and Italy in the fields of economy, trade, and science and technology will become increasingly broad.

Deqing Kui said that the purpose of the delegation's visit is to understand the situation of China's economic reform and development, to promote and participate in investment in China, and to promote friendly cooperation between the two countries. After the meeting, Chen Mu Hua hosted a banquet to welcome the Italian guests.

In the morning, Li Peng, Vice Chairman of the Financial and Economic Committee, held a working meeting with the Italian counterparts.
