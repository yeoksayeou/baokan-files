In the annals of modern Chinese science, a particularly bright star that has shone for over half a century finally fell from the heavens on the morning of December 19, 1988. He was our esteemed science popularizer, my mentor and friend, Gao Siqi.

Gao Siqi, this great writer who created a multitude of excellent science popularization works, alongside France's Jules Verne, the Soviet Union's Ilyin, and the United States' Asimov, made immense contributions to the popularization of scientific knowledge for humanity. His legendary life, marked by physical disability but an unyielding spirit, and his relentless pursuit of progress, embodies the essence of China's outstanding intellectuals, unparalleled in the world.

Born in 1905 in a scholarly family in Fuzhou, in 1918 he went to study at Qinghua University's preparatory school for studying in the United States. In 1925, with a strong desire to "save the country through science," he went to the United States to study. In 1928, while researching the encephalitis virus, he unfortunately contracted the disease. With unyielding determination, he continued his studies and graduated from the University of Chicago's Medical Research Institute in 1930. Returning to China, amidst the chaos and hardship of the old society, he dragged his diseased body, with a heart full of passion, and began to cultivate the barren land of science popularization in China. His science popularization works bloomed like wild lilies in the Chinese countryside, their simple and elegant demeanor winning the hearts of the people.

With an indomitable will, he endured the harshness of war, dragging his increasingly paralyzed body to Yan'an, the interior, and Taiwan. After liberation, he returned to Beijing. Through countless hardships and sufferings, with the optimistic and broad-minded spirit of a steadfast Communist, he fought against his illness. His tenacious spirit and unyielding pursuit of progress inspired generation after generation.

I am one of the many who have benefited from Master Gao's teachings. Over 30 years ago, in my hometown in Zhejiang, I first read "The Autobiography of a Mushroom." If a good book read during childhood and adolescence can have a profound impact on one's life, then Gao Siqi's book was such a work for me. It enlightened my thoughts and opened up a path of science and literature before me. I believe that for young people in their growth and learning stages, if they have a good book that can inspire them, it is like making a sincere and intelligent friend.

In the mid-1950s, I met Gao Siqi, whom I had long admired, in Beijing's Gan Jie Hutong. His writing reflected his character. Gao Siqi was indeed an extraordinary person! I was moved by the vitality hidden within his paralyzed body, the passion hidden behind his lack of expression, the firmness hidden in his muffled speech, and the rhythm hidden in his trembling limbs. Disease could use its poison to confine a vigorous and ambitious person to a wheelchair, but it could not stop the song of willpower from a tenacious person or the shout of determination!

During my first visit, I saw a paralyzed man who was still walking, running, and advancing. He was fighting! He was writing profound, knowledgeable, and artistically superb science popularization works. He was communicating with the broad masses, especially the youth, and the disease could not stop the symphony of our voices.

Later, especially during the ten years of turmoil, we had many exchanges, and I learned a great deal from him, gaining a deeper understanding of him. At that time, I was very frustrated, unable to fulfill my ambitions in emergency medicine and with nowhere to cultivate my science popularization work. Master Gao, as an elder and a "friend across generations," patiently taught and encouraged me. Little did I know that he had great difficulty speaking, sometimes unable to finish a sentence, and had to rely on "writing by hand." But his stiff, unyielding fingers found it extremely difficult to write a few characters. When his meaning was guessed correctly, the room would burst into a special kind of joy, and his face, covered in sweat, would show a childlike smile. At this moment, he would use his "unique" "Gao language" (I call his words that ordinary people cannot understand) to joke, "I am writing 'heavenly script'!" Sometimes, when talking, his upper eyelids would droop, covering his eyes, and he would need a massage to open them, but he would still enthusiastically talk with us. When his family members wiped his face, if the action was a bit heavy, he would humorously say, "This is not wiping the floor." He was truly an optimistic gentleman!

In those confusing times, I often worried about China's future and my career, even losing confidence, but Master Gao firmly believed that after winter comes spring. In 1973, Master Gao published the famous poem "The March of Life," which sang, "Life, you are a song that never ends; you sing of the joyous earth, you sing of the joyous spring. Life, you are a drama that never ends; it has been performed for 300 million years and continues to this day. Life, you are a painting that never ends; from the formation of proteins to the appearance of humans. Life, you are an epic that never ends; it begins from ancient times and continues to this day." This poem, full of ideals and hope, who would have thought it came from the pen of an elderly, paralyzed, and ailing old man? Those who knew him and understood him would be both happy and excited to see this poem. The seeds of life will always sprout!

After the fall of the "Gang of Four," Master Gao worked tirelessly with unbounded enthusiasm for the Four Modernizations. After numerous studies, we jointly wrote a letter to Deng Xiaoping and Fang Yi, proposing suggestions on improving the scientific and cultural level of the nation, especially for scientific and technological personnel to engage in science popularization. The central leaders attached great importance to this letter and made instructions. Master Gao felt a great sense of responsibility and thought day and night about how to implement it.

Master Gao guided my science popularization creation like a teacher guiding a primary school student. When I used my spare time to edit "A Selection of Gao Siqi and His Works," using a three-dimensional structure of biography, works, and analysis, Master Gao revised my literary biography word by word. He used his trembling hand to make changes in the text. On the page where it originally said, "They planned to open courses in Chinese, mathematics, and cultivation," he used a pencil to change the "cultivation" character to "body." He told me in a muffled, indistinct voice that it was not a "cultivation" course but a "body cultivation" course. When the manuscript turned to "In the later stages of the Anti-Japanese War, when he was in Huangyao, he began to study mathematics... he was indeed a mathematician," he pointed to the pencil mark below this passage and said, "Not appropriate, it cannot be said like this." He wanted me to delete "indeed a mathematician." At that time, I said "indeed" was not the same as "indeed," but he insisted on deleting it.

Master Gao was very sincere and caring towards people. When he learned that I had a retinal hemorrhage, he insisted on visiting me. Later, he had his secretary, Gao Yangzhi, write a letter and call to remind me to rest well. To ease his worries, I visited him. He looked at me with deep affection and, with great difficulty, hummed, asking me to take care of myself. His wife, Jin Aiyi, and his son, Gao Zhiqi, said, "Zonghao is a doctor himself, you can rest assured, he will take care of himself." But Master Gao still kept saying, asking me not to worry and to rest more. Master Gao's sincerity and kindness towards people, I think, are best described by the famous poet Zang Kejia. Kejia almost every time he saw me would ask about Master Gao's situation and happily recall his meeting with Master Gao in my small room. He said, "Gao Siqi has a boiling passion, inspiring people, his feelings are sincere. His trembling but barely liftable hand is an exclamation mark that surprises and delights people!" Kejia often said, "I like Gao Siqi's poetry, but I like Gao Siqi the person even more!"

Yes, Gao Siqi is our sincere friend. His works and his character have influenced generation after generation. The stars hanging in the sky may fade, but Gao Siqi, this strong life, was tightly bound by disease, paralysis, and disability for 60 years, restricting this talented and passionate life, cruelly depriving him of his passionate love and the joys of life. But with his rare strength, perseverance, and the high spirit of self-reliance of the Chinese people, he achieved a unique life value, leaving a brilliant page in the history of human scientific civilization. The organic life may have disappeared, but the immortal spirit will forever resonate in "The March of Life"!

　　自强不息的“生命进行曲”
    ——哭高士其
    李宗浩
    在中国现代科学史上，半个多世纪来闪烁着一颗特殊光亮的明星，终于坠落在１９８８年１２月１９日黎明的星空。他就是我们敬重的科普作家、我的良师益友高士其同志。
    高士其，这位创作出大量优秀科普作品的伟大作家，与法国的儒勒·凡尔纳、苏联的伊林和美国的阿西莫夫一样，为人类普及科学知识作出了巨大的贡献。而他传奇式的经历，身残志坚、进取奋发、君子自强不息的精神，则凝聚着中华民族优秀知识分子的精英，举世无比。
    １９０５年，他生于福州一个书香之家，１９１８年到北京清华留美预备学校求学，１９２５年抱着“科学救国”的强烈愿望到美国求学。１９２８年在研究脑炎病毒的一天，不幸受到感染，他用顽强毅力继续学习，１９３０年在芝加哥大学医学研究院毕业回国。在灾难深重的旧中国，他拖着病残的身子，怀着满腔的热血，在中国这块荒凉的科普文化处女地上，艰难地耕作着。他的科普作品像野百合花似地开放在中国的原野，它的清秀朴实的姿态赢得了人们对他的喜爱。
    他，更以常人难以想象的毅力，在残酷的战争年代，拖着日趋加重瘫痪的身子奔向延安、内地、台湾，解放后回到北京。历尽艰辛，饱尝苦难，但他以一个坚强的共产党人乐观宽大的胸怀，与病魔作斗争的顽强精神和永远向上进取的豪情，激励教育了一代又一代人。
    我，就是深得高老教诲的一代人中的一个。３０多年前，我在浙江故乡的小镇，第一次读到了《菌儿自传》。如果说，一个人在童提、少年时代读一本好书对他终生产生重大影响的话，那末，高士其的这本书对我就是这样一本著作。它启蒙了我的思想，在我面前敞开了一条科学、文学的道路。我认为，对于正处在长身体、长知识的青少年来讲，如果有一本足以激动他们的好书，就等于交了一个正派、聪明的朋友。
    ５０年代中期，我在北京干面胡同见到了仰慕已久的高士其同志。文如其人。高士其，确实是个了不起的人！我被他瘫痪身体中蕴藏着的活力，缺少表情里浸透着的热情，含糊语言里爆发出的坚定，颤抖肢体里显出的节奏感动了。病魔可以用毒力把一个血气方刚、富有抱负的人囚禁在椅子上，但却无法禁止顽强人身上毅力的高歌、意志的呐喊！
    第一次的拜访，我是看到了一个瘫痪的人，还一直在走路、在跑步、在前进。他在战斗！他写着一篇篇思想深刻、知识充实、艺术高超的科普作品。他在与广大人民尤其是青少年交流着感情，病魔“止不住我们声浪的交响”。
    后来，尤其在十年动乱，我们过往甚多，受他教育匪浅，对他也有了更深的了解。那时，我十分苦闷，在急救事业上有志难酬，在科普创作上无处耕耘。高老，以一位长者、“忘年之交”的身份，谆谆教导和鼓励我。岂知，他吐字十分困难，有时讲不清楚一句话，只好借助“手书”，但他那僵硬的不听驾驭的手指，要写几个字也是难上加难。当猜对了他的意思，房间里顿时爆发出一种特殊的喜悦，他那汗流满面的脸也见到了儿童般的笑颜。这时，他还用他那“独特”的“高语”（我称他那常人听不懂的话）开玩笑地说：“我写的是‘天书’呀！”有时谈谈话，他的上眼睑下垂盖住了眼睛，需要按摩，才能使眼睛睁开，但他还是兴致勃勃地与我们谈话。当家人给他擦脸时，有时动作稍重，他又用风趣的语言：“这可不是擦地板。”真是一位乐观的君子！
    在那扑朔迷离的年代，我常常对中国的前途、事业忧心忡忡乃至丧失信心，但高老坚信隆冬过去就是春天。１９７３年高老发表了著名的诗篇《生命进行曲》，唱道：“生命啊！你是一首唱不完的歌；你歌唱欢乐的大地，你歌唱喜悦的春天。生命啊！你是一出演不完的戏剧；３０万万年前就已演出，一直演到今天。生命啊！你是一幅画不完的图案；从蛋白质的形成，一直画到人的出现。生命啊！你是一部写不完的史诗；从远古时代写起，一直写到现在。”这充满理想和希望的诗篇，哪像是出于一个年迈瘫痪多病的老人的笔下？熟悉他的人，了解他的人，一看到这首诗又高兴又激动，生命的种子总是要萌发的！
    粉碎“四人帮”后，高老以对四化建设抑制不住的热情在忘我地工作着。经过了无数次的研究，我们一起写了一封信给邓小平、方毅同志，提出了关于提高全民族科学文化中科技人员从事科普事业等方面的建议。中央领导同志对此信十分重视并作了批示，高老更感责任重大，日思夜想如何去付诸实施。
    高老对我的科普创作像老师把着小学生的手在教我。当我利用业余时间主编《高士其及其作品选介》一书，用传记、作品、分析三者合一的立体结构时，高老逐字逐句地替我修改我写的文学传记。他用颤抖的手，在字里行间修改。在原稿“他们要开设国文、算术和修养三门课程”一页时，他用铅笔弯弯曲曲地将“修养”的“养”字改成“身”。他用模糊不清哼哼的喉音告诉我，不是“修养”课而是“修身”课。当书稿翻到“抗战后期他在黄姚时研究起数学，……俨然又是一位数学家”时，他用手指着这段话下面划的铅笔道说：“不恰当，不能这样提。”要我把“俨然又是一位数学家”删掉。当时我说“俨然并非就是”还是可用的，但他坚持删去。
    高老对人十分真诚关怀。当他得知我的眼底出血，非要来看我，后来又让秘书高仰之同志写信、打电话嘱我一定要好好休息。为免他记挂，我去看他，他充满深情地望着我，用艰难的喉音哼着，要我保重。他的夫人金爱娣同志和儿子高志其同志说，“宗浩自己是大夫，你放心好了，他会注意的。”但高老还是不停地说，叫我不要着急，多休息。高老对人之真，待人之诚，我认为著名诗人臧克家同志的话最为确切。克家同志几乎每次见到我，都向我问起高老的情况，而且十分高兴地回忆他和高老在我的斗室里的见面。他说，“高士其同志有沸水般的热情，令人激动，他的感情是真挚的。他那颤抖的但能艰难地抬起来的手，是一个令人又惊又喜的惊叹号！”克家同志常说，“我喜欢高士其同志的诗，我更喜欢高士其同志的人！”
    是的，高士其同志是我们真诚的朋友。他的作品，他的为人，影响了一代又一代人。悬挂在太空中的星光虽然消逝了，高士其这个坚强的生命在被疾病、瘫痪、残废，这无形的毒蛇紧紧地缠绕了６０年之久，束缚了这个才华横溢、满腔热血的生命，残酷地剥夺了他热烈的爱情和人生享有的欢乐。但他用人间罕见的坚强、毅力和中华儿女自强不息的高风，获得了独特的生命价值，在人类科学文明史上留下了光辉夺目的一页，有机的生命消失了，但不朽的精神，永远回响在“生命进行曲”中！
