The Yellow River Water Transfer to Qingdao Project, following the Luan River Water Transfer to Tianjin Project, has made significant progress since its commencement in April 1986. The project has completed 80% of the total work, with a 96% excellence rate for individual projects, and is scheduled to deliver water to Qingdao by November.

Qingdao is severely short of water. Experts have calculated that by 1990, Qingdao will need over 600,000 tons of water daily, but currently, it can only supply 270,000 tons. The severe shortage of water resources has become a major constraint on Qingdao's opening up to the outside world and its economic development. After the completion of the Yellow River Water Transfer to Qingdao Project, Qingdao will have an additional 300,000 tons of water supplied daily. The project passes through areas with high fluoride and water shortages along the route, providing 11 million cubic meters of water and solving the drinking water needs of 610,000 people.

　　引黄济青工程建设速度快
    本报讯  记者宋学春报道：继引滦入津水利工程后的又一大工程“引黄济青”，从一九八六年四月开工以来，工程建设进展顺利，已完成总工程量的百分之八十，单项工程优良率达百分之九十六，将于十一月按期向青岛送水。
    青岛市严重缺水，据专家测算，到一九九零年青岛市每天需要用水六十多万吨，而现在仅能供二十七万吨。水资源严重不足已成青岛对外开放和国民经济发展的主要制约因素。引黄济青工程建成后可为青岛增加日供水量三十万吨。工程经过沿线高氟、缺水区，可以供水一千一百万立方米，解决六十一万人的生活用水。
