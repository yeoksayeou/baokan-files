	Vice Premier Song Jian, during his inspection in Shaanxi, pointed out that high technology should be given a very important position.

	New China News Agency reporter Hua Nianlun and our reporter Jing Xianfeng report from Xi'an on January 26: "Shaanxi has many high-tech industries and strong scientific and technological forces, but it cannot sufficiently drive the local economy, which is truly regrettable." This was the sentiment expressed by Vice Premier and Chairman of the State Science and Technology Commission Song Jian during his recent inspection work in Shaanxi.

	Song Jian emphasized that in the coming years, as China implements the coastal development strategy, it is crucial to accelerate the development of China's high-tech industries. This is a steadfast policy of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council.

	From January 23 to 26, Song Jian inspected the aircraft manufacturing city of the northwest region - Xi'an Aircraft Manufacturing Company, the only factory in China currently producing color picture tubes - Shaanxi Color Picture Tube Factory, the Xi'an Satellite Control Center, the Xi'an Chemical Research Institute, two universities, and the newly constructed Xi'an New Technology Industrial Development Zone. He also listened to the work reports from Governor Hou Zongbin, Mayor Yuan Zhengzhong of Xi'an, and other relevant officials. He believed that the strategic decision of "Revitalizing Shaanxi through Science and Technology" made by the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government indicates the true awakening of the Shaanxi people.

	During a discussion with some scientific and technological personnel in Xi'an, Song Jian praised the Xi'an Municipal Government's policy of "two legs walking": one focusing on the development of high-tech industries and the other on scientific and technological support for counties. He said, this is in line with China's national conditions. The vast majority of the Chinese people live in rural areas, and the rural areas in Shaanxi are relatively isolated. If we do not change the mindset of the vast number of farmers and establish new concepts of socialist commodity economy, the overall economy will not develop. At the same time, in the context of the rapid development of the new technological revolution in the world today, if we do not grasp high-tech industries, we will miss the opportunity, and China's economy may forever stagnate at a low level.

	Song Jian said that to fully leverage the advantages of high technology, the key is to activate the flow of talent. The current problem is that the flow is not sufficient. Now, many talents are accumulated in schools, enterprises, and research institutes, and about one-third of them cannot fully play their roles. We should allow this part of the people to come out in various forms to establish enterprises similar to those in Xi'an. Higher education institutions should be encouraged to "divide paths" in a planned manner: some to teach, some to conduct research, and some to develop. Large enterprises and research institutes can, through in-depth reform and optimization, transfer part of their forces in an organized manner to engage in the development of new technology industries, leveraging group advantages.

	Song Jian also visited Xi'an Jiaotong University and Northwest Polytechnical University to see the research achievements in the development of high-tech industries and hoped that the schools would retain a lean team for basic scientific research to strengthen the foundation for the development of high technology and the economy.

　　国务委员宋健在陕西考察时指出    
    要把高技术放在相当重要地位
    本报西安１月２６日电  新华社记者华年轮、本报记者景险峰报道：“陕西高技术产业多，科技力量雄厚，却不能把地方经济足够地带动起来，实在是一大憾事。”这是国务委员兼国家科委主任宋健日前在陕西考察工作时的感慨。
    宋健着重指出，在今后若干年内，我国在实施沿海发展战略时，要把加速中国高技术产业的发展放在相当重要的地位。这是党中央、国务院坚定不移的方针。
    １月２３日至２６日，宋健考察了西北地区的飞机城——西安飞机制造公司、我国目前唯一生产彩色显象管的陕西彩色显象管总厂、西安卫星测控中心、西安化工研究所、两所高等学校和正在建设中的西安新技术产业开发区，并听取了省长侯宗宾、西安市市长袁正中及有关同志的工作汇报。他认为，陕西省委、省政府确定的“科技兴陕”的战略，表明了陕西人民的真正觉醒。
    在同西安市部分科技人员的座谈中，宋健称赞西安市政府提出的科技工作一抓高技术产业开发、二抓科技包县的“两条腿走路”的方针。他说，这符合中国的国情。中国的绝大部分人民生活在农村，陕西的农村比较闭塞，不把广大农民的思想转变过来，建立起社会主义商品经济新观念，整个经济就发展不起来。同时，在当今世界新技术革命迅猛发展的大趋势中，我们如果不抓高科技产业，贻误战机，我国的经济可能永远徘徊在低水平上。
    宋健说，要充分发挥高技术优势，关键在于把人才流动搞活。当前的问题是流动不够。现在学校、企业、研究所积压人才太多，不能充分发挥作用的约有１／３左右，应该允许这一部分人以各种各样的形式出来办类似西安的企业。应当鼓励高等院校有计划地“分路”：一部分人搞教学，一部分人搞科研，一部分人搞开发。一些大型企业、研究所则可以通过深入改革、优化组合，使一部分力量有组织地转移，发挥群体优势，投入新技术产业的开发。
    宋健还在西安交通大学、西北工业大学参观了两校在开发高技术产业中的科研成果，并希望学校保留一支基础科学研究的精干队伍，为高技术和经济的发展增强后劲。
