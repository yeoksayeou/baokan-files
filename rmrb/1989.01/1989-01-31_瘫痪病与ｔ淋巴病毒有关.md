American researchers have discovered that paralysis disease is closely related to a human T-lymphotropic virus similar to the AIDS virus.

Researchers at the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia conducted genetic tests on blood samples from six patients with multiple sclerosis, a condition that can lead to paralysis, and from twenty healthy individuals. The results showed that all six patients carried the genetic material of the human T-lymphotropic virus, while only one out of the twenty healthy individuals had this genetic material. This finding directly indicates that the human T-lymphotropic virus is associated with the development of multiple sclerosis.

　　瘫痪病与Ｔ淋巴病毒有关
    新华社北京一月三十日电  美国研究人员发现，瘫痪病与类似艾滋病毒的人体Ｔ淋巴病毒关系密切。
    费城威斯塔研究所的研究人员分别对六名能导致瘫痪的多发性硬化病患者和二十名健康人做了血样遗传学检验，结果发现六名患者都带有人体Ｔ淋巴病毒遗传体，而二十名健康人中只有一人带有这种遗传体。这一结果直接证明，人体Ｔ淋巴病毒与多发性硬化病的形成有关。
