The Heze region insurance company and the civil affairs bureau of Shandong Province have recently arranged home property insurance for 30,000 rural households of preferential treatment objects in the entire region to alleviate the concerns of martyrs' families, disabled veterans, and demobilized and retired soldiers. In the event of water disasters, fires, and other accidents within the scope of insurance responsibilities during the insurance period, the insurance company will be responsible for compensation.

Several active-duty soldiers, upon learning that their family property is "insured," wrote to the local government saying, "The Party and the government care about us and think of everything. We will definitely serve the country with peace of mind and contribute more to the army and modern construction."

    菏泽地区为优抚对象办理家庭财产保险
  　山东省菏泽地区保险公司、民政局，为解除全区烈军属、残废、复员退伍军人的后顾之忧，最近为全区３万户农村优抚对象办理了家庭财产保险。如在保险期内遭受水灾、火灾和其它保险责任范围内的灾害事故，由保险公司负责赔偿。
    几名现役军人得知家中财产“保了险”，给当地政府来信说，党和政府对我们很关心，想的也很周到，我们一定要安心服役，为部队和现代化建设多做贡献。（文斌）
