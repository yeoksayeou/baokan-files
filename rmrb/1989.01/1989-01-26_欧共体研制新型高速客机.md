	The European Community is developing a new type of high-speed passenger aircraft. Several major aircraft manufacturers in Western Europe, in accordance with the "Euram" research plan proposed by the twelve member countries of the European Community, have decided to jointly develop new supersonic and hypersonic passenger aircraft for use in the 21st century.

	According to the French magazine "Aeroport," under the "Euram" plan, the supersonic transport aircraft currently being developed by Western European countries will be the second generation of the "Concorde" aircraft. Its cruising speed will reach 2,400 kilometers per hour, flying at an altitude of 18,000 to 20,000 meters, with a range of 12,000 kilometers, and a capacity of 200 passengers. It is expected to be put into operation between 2005 and 2010. Another type of new passenger aircraft is the hypersonic passenger aircraft, with a cruising speed of 2,400 to 6,000 kilometers per hour, flying at an altitude of 30,000 meters, and a range of 12,000 kilometers. It is estimated that it will be put into service between 2010 and 2015.

　　欧共体研制新型高速客机
    新华社巴黎一月二十三日电（记者茅瑞清）几家西欧最大的飞机制造厂家，根据欧洲共同体十二个成员国提出的“厄罗马”研究计划，决定共同研制二十一世纪初使用的新型超音速、特超音速客机。
    据法国《航空港》月刊报道，根据“厄罗马”计划，西欧国家正在研制的超音速运输机将是目前使用的“协和号”飞机的第二代。它的航速可达每小时二千四百公里，飞行高度为一点八—二万米，续航里程一点二万公里，载客二百人，预计到二○○五年—二○一○年间投入运行。另一种新型客机是特超音速客机，其航速每小时二千四百—六千公里，飞行高度达三万米，航程为一万二千公里，估计到二○一○年—二○一五年时才能加入客运。
