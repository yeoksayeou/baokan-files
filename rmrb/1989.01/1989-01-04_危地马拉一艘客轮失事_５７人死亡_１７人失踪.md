The ship capsized while sailing between these two cities. Survivors reported that the ship sank due to overloading.

　　危地马拉一艘客轮失事
    ５７人死亡  １７人失踪
    新华社北京１月３日电  危地马拉城消息：一艘悬挂危地马拉旗的客轮１日在加勒比海上沉没，造成５７人死亡、１７人失踪。
    据危地马拉官方人士２日对埃菲社说，这艘载有１２０人的客轮是从利文斯顿开往距首都东部２９８公里的巴里奥斯港的。当船行驶在这两个城市之间的水域时突然倾翻。据幸存者说，船沉没是由于超载造成的。
    沉船事件发生后，危地马拉海上救援队和４艘海军巡逻艇迅速前往援救，共救起４６名幸存者，打捞起５７具尸体。危地马拉政府已下令继续寻找失踪者，并查清这次事故的真实原因。
