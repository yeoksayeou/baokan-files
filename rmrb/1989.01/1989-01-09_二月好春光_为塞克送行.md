	The Beauty of February
		For Sayek's Farewell
		Gěxīn

	Sayek was unable to welcome the beauty of February this year, as he concluded his 82-year journey in late winter of last year.

	Comrade Sayek was a renowned actor and film star in Shanghai during the 1930s. Today, those over 70 may still recall him, but younger generations might find him unfamiliar.

	In November 1938, when Japanese planes were relentlessly bombing Yanan, Sayek and his wife, Xian Xinghai, arrived from the rear areas. At the welcoming ceremony, the crowd enthusiastically sang "The Song of the Salvation Army," which Sayek had composed in 1934. This song expressed the unwavering resolve of the Chinese people to unite against the enemy and fight together. The rhythm of the song resonated with Sayek's heartbeat, and the emotions of the singers and the composer blended seamlessly. That evening, Chairman Mao personally attended the banquet to welcome Xian Xinghai and Sayek. After the banquet, Chairman Mao said to Sayek, "Stay and work with us. Our pond is small, but we dare to raise big fish!" Moved by the Chairman's sincerity, Sayek immediately decided to stay in Yanan.

	In February 1939, Chairman Mao issued the call to "Self-reliance, Clothing and Food Sufficiency." After several nights of contemplation, Sayek and Xian Xinghai composed the opera "The Great Chorus of Production." The opera, with three acts and nine songs, had a fresh and lively tune. The music and drama departments of the Lu Xun Academy of Arts jointly performed it, receiving enthusiastic applause from the audience. Among the songs, "In February" had the charm of Jiangnan folk music, was easy to learn, and was sung by everyone in Yanan, young and old.

	In August 1939, Sayek's old partner Xian Xinghai was sent to the Soviet Union on a mission. Less than half a year later, the news of Xian Xinghai's death reached them, and the teachers and students of Lu Xun Academy were deeply saddened. Sayek was particularly grief-stricken, spending days facing the mountains in silent reflection. In his sorrow, he composed the song "In Memory of the People's Singer, Xian Xinghai." He also provided as much care and support as possible to Xian Xinghai's widow and daughter Nina. Throughout his life, he never forgot his friendship with Xian Xinghai. If Xian Xinghai had lived longer, they would have certainly created more and better artistic works together.

	Chairman Mao highly valued Sayek's artistic talent. Upon his arrival, he was appointed as a professor at the Lu Xun Academy of Literature. Later, he was invited by Comrade Feng Wenbin of the Youth League to serve as the director of the Youth Art Theater, with Wu Xue as the deputy director. During this period, Lu Xun Academy performed "Sunrise," and the Youth Art Theater performed the Soviet play "Armored Train," contributing to the development of the theatrical troupe and training a large number of new talents.

	In 1940, at the suggestion of Tian Fang and Wang Bin from Lu Xun Academy, the play "Three Hundred Million Refugees," which had been repeatedly banned in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, was staged in Yanan's Cultural Square.

	This play vividly exposed the suffering of the Northeast people who had lost their homes and the corruption of the Kuomintang's passive resistance. When Sayek performed this play in Shanghai, he was repeatedly interrogated and pursued by the Kuomintang, with no day of peace. He had been imprisoned by the Kuomintang five times, and the lines "Drinking cold water in the winter, drop by drop in the heart" were his experience of prison life. Today, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, he finally had the freedom to create and perform, and a stage to showcase his talents! Whenever he recalled this period of his life, he would always sigh with emotion about his work and harvest on this land, his conversations with Chairman Mao, his close cooperation with Xian Xinghai, and the achievements of his comrades in performance and creation...

	In the early years of the founding of the nation, he served as the director of the Northeast Lu Xun Academy of Arts and directed the large-scale opera "Spark of Fire." Later, he also directed "Who to Follow?" and "Those Who Know the Times" to support the "Three-Antis" and "Five-Antis" campaigns.

	After the outbreak of the Korean War, with great concern and enthusiasm for the Korean people, he spent two weeks immersed in creation, completing the long poem "Song of the Taedong River." He took the suffering of the Korean people as his own, shouldering the mission to support the Korean people and the just war.

	During his more than 20 years of work in Beijing, he wrote lyrics for the films "Gate Number Six" and "When the Grapes Ripen," and provided constructive suggestions for the film scripts "Red Rock," "Five Heroes of Mount Langya," and "Little Soldier Zhang Ga."

	During his tenure, he participated in the review, script revision, and rehearsal guidance of various types of films, dramas, operas, dances, Peking operas, and Hebei operas. When asked why he did not write his name on these scripts, he shook his head and smiled: "An artist's thoughts are in the work, not on the surface."

	Yes, Sayek's name is little known, but his thoughts are deeply imprinted in his works. He will forever live in his works and in the hearts of those who have seen and heard his artistic creations!

### 二月好春光——为塞克送行

　　二月好春光
    ——为塞克送行
    革新
    塞克未能迎接今年的二月好春光，在去年冬末结束了他的８２年人生历程。
    塞克同志是３０年代轰动上海的著名话剧演员和电影明星。现在，７０岁以上的人对他还略知一二，年岁再小些的就感陌生了。
    １９３８年１１月，当日本飞机疯狂轰炸延安的时候，塞克和冼星海夫妇从大后方来到延安。欢迎会上，群众高声唱起塞克１９３４年作的《救国军歌》。这歌声表达了全国人民团结对敌、一致抗战的坚定信念，这歌声的节拍与塞克的心一起跳动，歌者和作者的情感到了水乳交融的境界。当晚，毛主席亲自出席宴会，对星海夫妇和塞克表示欢迎。会后，毛主席对塞克说：“留在我们这里工作吧，我们的池子小，还是敢养大鱼的哟！”塞克被主席的诚挚感动，当即决定留在延安。
    １９３９年２月，毛主席发出了“自己动手，丰衣足食”的号召。塞克和星海经过几昼夜的思考推敲，谱写了歌剧《生产大合唱》。全剧三幕九个小曲，格调清新，节奏明快。鲁迅艺术学院音乐系、戏剧系联合演出，受到群众的热烈欢迎。其中，《二月里来》这首歌，具有江南民歌的神韵，好学易唱，延安的男女老少无人不会哼唱。
    １９３９年８月，塞克的老搭档星海奉命前往苏联，不到半年，星海逝世的噩耗传来，鲁艺师生无不为之唏嘘啜泣。塞克更是悲痛万分，整天面对群山，默默沉思，悲哀中，产生了他的作品《悼念人民的歌手——冼星海》这首歌。对星海的遗孀及女儿妮娜，他都给予可能的关心和帮助。他一生都不忘和星海的友情。如果星海长寿，定能和他合作出更多更好的文艺作品来。
    毛主席很重视塞克的艺术才华，初来时聘他为鲁迅文学院的教授，后又委托青联的冯文彬同志礼请塞克担任青年艺术剧院院长，吴雪为副院长。在这期间，延安鲁艺演了《日出》，青艺演了苏联话剧《铁甲列车》，为戏剧队伍的发展，培养了大批生力军。
    １９４０年，由鲁艺的田方、王滨提议，把塞克创作的在国民党统治区多次遭到禁演的剧目《流民三千万》搬到延安文化广场上演。
    这个剧把东北人民流离失所的苦难和蒋介石反动政府消极抗战的腐败现象，揭露得淋漓致尽。塞克在上海演此剧时曾多次被国民党审讯、追捕，无一宁日。他曾被国民党５次投入牢房，“十冬腊月喝凉水，点点滴滴在心头”的诗句，就是他坐牢生活的体会。今天，在党中央毛主席身边，他才有了创作、演出的自由，才有了发挥才能的天地！每当回忆这一段生活时，他总是感慨万分地谈到在这块土地上的耕耘和收获，他和毛主席的谈话，他和星海的密切合作及战友们演出与创作的成果……
    建国初期，他任东北鲁艺院长，执导了大型歌剧《星星之火》。后来，又配合一打三反运动排演了《跟谁走？》、《识时务者》。
    抗美援朝的战火燃起后，他以对朝鲜人民的极大关注和热情，连续两周埋头创作，一气呵成了长诗《大同江之歌》，把朝鲜人民的苦难当作自己的苦难，把声援朝鲜人民、支持正义战争的使命担在肩上。
    在北京工作的２０多年间，他曾给电影《六号门》、《葡萄熟了的时候》写过歌词，也为电影剧本《红岩》、《狼牙山五壮士》、《小兵张嘎》提过中肯的修改意见。
    在他任职期内，他参与了电影、话剧、歌剧、舞剧、京剧、评剧等各种类型剧目的审查、修改剧本、排练指导等各项工作。当有人问到为什么在这些剧本上不写他的姓名时，他摇摇头笑了：“艺术家的思想在作品里，而不在字面上。”
    是的，塞克的名字鲜为人知，但他的思想已深深印入他的作品里，他永远活在他的作品里，活在看过和听过他的艺术作品的人们心中！
