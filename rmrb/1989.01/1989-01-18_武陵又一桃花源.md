Upon arriving in the city of Youyang Autonomous County in the eastern part of Sichuan, amidst towering mountains and deep valleys, a friend immediately introduced me to the Peach Blossom Spring. I was startled. Is there a Peach Blossom Spring here too? The Peach Blossom Spring in Changde, Hunan, has been widely recognized since the Tang and Song dynasties as the authentic Peach Blossom Spring. Where did this one in Youyang come from? Does it also have a peach blossom forest stretching for hundreds of steps along the riverbanks? Does it also have a small cave in the mountain, where one can see fertile fields, beautiful pools, mulberry trees, and bamboo as soon as one enters?

The car stopped about three miles northwest of the county city, by the green silk-like Biqin River. To the left, there is a small stream bubbling along. Following the stream, not far ahead, there is a mountain with a hollow in it. Inside the mountain is a large cave, about thirty meters high and twenty meters wide, like a gate. The stream flows through the cave. At the top of the cave wall, there is a "Stone Room for Hiding Books" scenic spot. This is a stone room that can accommodate dozens of people. It is said that the Qin people once hid books here. Below the stone room, there are four characters carved: "Ancient Book Hiding Place." The rest of the carvings on the walls are like cave writings, blurred and difficult to decipher.

Walking about a hundred meters, exiting the cave, the view suddenly opens up. A farmland of about fifty acres stretches before your eyes. The farmland is surrounded by mountains on three sides, especially the side facing the cave, which is a sheer cliff a hundred feet high. There are ancient vines hanging down from the top of the cliff, which can be used to climb up. There are karst caves on the cliff, with stone statues of people, horses, and lions inside, vast and empty.

The friend said that there used to be people living by the mountain, but now only the house foundations remain. Imagining the past, this place had "neat houses," "crisscrossing paths," and "chickens and dogs could be heard." It was indeed a place with "fertile fields, beautiful pools, mulberry trees, and bamboo."

This place is called Dayou Cave, and its scenery is no less beautiful than that of the Peach Blossom Spring in Hunan. Unfortunately, this good place has been turned into an oil storage facility, and without special permission, one cannot enter this Peach Blossom Spring. Although it is spring, the scene of "peach blossoms flowing red" is not seen, and the peach blossoms have disappeared.

Returning to the county city, I borrowed a copy of the "Youyang Prefecture Gazette." The compiler also carefully investigated and described this place: "Examining its shape, it is exactly the same as the Peach Blossom Spring described by Tao Yuanming." At the same time, it points out, "Youyang was part of Wuling Prefecture during the Han Dynasty, and the ferry where the fisherman asked, who knows if it is not here?"

Youyang was once part of the nine streams and eighteen valleys of the Tusi region, with poor transportation and long-term isolation. For a long time, "the Han did not enter the territory, and the barbarians did not leave the valleys," so scholars and literati rarely visited, and there are no historical records to confirm it as the Peach Blossom Spring.

Our nation has perhaps experienced too many wars and hardships, so a work like "Peach Blossom Spring Record," a fictional literary work—an ideal utopia imagined and described by a poet—has long been the heavy longing and hope of generations. However, the elusive utopia is just an abstract painting. The Peach Blossom Spring is nowhere to be found, so let us cherish the land beneath our feet!

　　武陵又一桃花源
    颜家文
    刚到四川东部崇山峻岭中的酉阳自治县城，友人便向我介绍起桃花源来。我猛一惊，此处也有桃花源么？湖南常德的桃花源，自唐宋以来，似乎就已被人们确认为桃源之正宗，酉阳的桃花源是打哪儿冒出来的呢？也是那般有夹岸数百步的桃花林，也是那般山有小口，入口便可看见良田美池桑竹之属么？
    汽车出县城西北三里许，在绿绸一般的碧津河边停住。往左，有小溪汩汩流来，沿溪走去，不远处有一座山，山中空，一个高三十多米，宽二十多米的大洞，如同一门。小溪从洞中流过。洞壁顶有“石室藏书”景观。这是一个可容纳数十人的石室，据说秦人曾在这里藏书。石室下刻有“太古藏书”四字。其余壁刻都如蝌蚪文，模糊难辨。
    行百多米，出得洞来，豁然开朗。一片面积约五十来亩的农田推来眼际。农田三面环山，特别是迎洞一方，是一座百丈绝壁。有古藤从壁顶垂下，可援藤而上。壁上有溶洞，洞内有石人石马石狮，空阔无比。
    友人说，山边曾住有人家，如今只留下屋基。遥想当年，这里“屋舍俨然”，“阡陌交通”，“鸡犬相闻”，确也是“良田美池桑竹之属”。
    此处名大酉洞，风景确不下于湖南桃源。只可惜，好地方做了石油库，不是有特殊允许，是进不了这个桃花源的。虽是春天，而“桃涧流红”一景也不曾见得，已是桃花不知何处去了。
    回到县城，借来《酉阳州志》。修志人也认真对此地考察描绘过一番：“核其形，与渊明所谓桃花源者毫厘不差”。同时，也指出“酉阳于汉属武陵郡之迁徙地，渔郎所问之津，安知不在于此”？
    酉阳旧属九溪十八峒的土司之地，交通闭塞，长期以来“汉不入境，蛮不出峒”，名儒硕彦，游迹罕到，故文献无征，不能正名之为桃源耳。
    我们的民族兴许是经历了太多的征战与苦难，所以一篇《桃花源记》，一篇虚构的文学作品——诗人想象描绘的一块理想乐土，长期以来，成了历代人们过于厚重的向往和期冀。然而，虚无缥缈的乌托邦，不过是一幅抽象画。桃源望断无寻处，还是珍惜足下那一片土地吧！
