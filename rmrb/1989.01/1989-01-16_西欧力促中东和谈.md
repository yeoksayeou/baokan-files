The political stage of the Middle East has seen unusually active involvement from Western European countries. In the push for an early resolution to the Middle East conflict, Western Europe is emerging as a force to be reckoned with.

On the 13th, British Minister of State for Foreign Affairs William Waldegrave met with PLO Executive Committee Chairman Yasser Arafat in Tunis. Both sides agreed to work together to convene a Middle East peace conference this year. The significance of this event lies not only in the fact that a high-ranking British official held talks with Arafat himself for the first time but also in Britain's clear declaration that the PLO "should participate" in the Middle East peace conference. This meticulous British diplomat even humorously remarked that he would buy a piece of embroidered cushion in the place that Palestinians consider their homeland. The implications are extraordinary.

In light of British Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe's recent remarks during his visit to the Gulf and the Middle East, it is evident that Britain's Middle East policy is shifting. The focus of promoting Middle East peace talks has turned to urging Israel to change its stance. As Waldegrave put it, Britain wants to remind Israel, "not to miss the peace bus in the Middle East."

Two days later, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the European Community, Spanish Foreign Minister Francisco Fernandez Ordonez, led a delegation from the European Community to visit Israel. He declared that he had brought no specific proposals, only a mandate to survey the Middle East situation and inquire whether Israel had intentions for peace talks. However, immediately after concluding his talks with the Secretary-General of the Arab League, Chedli Klibi, he arrived in Israel to meet with Israeli leaders, clearly indicating his intention to promote peace. The focus of influence remains on Israel.

A week later, French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas will also visit Israel to personally understand the content of Israel's forthcoming "peace plan." France's Middle East policy has always differed from that of the United States. Recently, France decided to upgrade the diplomatic status of the PLO's representative office in France. It also facilitated direct talks between Israeli parliamentarians and PLO representatives in Paris. There are reports that the French government intends to co-host a preparatory meeting for the Middle East peace conference with the Soviet Union. This intention has been highly appreciated by the PLO. Currently, France is actively making behind-the-scenes connections.

Additionally, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl stated, "West Germany will shift its diplomatic focus to participating in the new process of Middle East peace talks." Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, after meeting with Arafat in Athens on the 11th, said that Greece would "commit to the final establishment of the Palestinian state."

At the end of this month, there will be another important diplomatic activity by the European Community in Madrid. The foreign ministers of France, Greece, and Spain will meet with Chairman Arafat, and then visit Israel, Egypt, Jordan, and Syria. Plans are also being prepared to convene a simulated Middle East peace conference by the European Parliament in May or June.

From this, it is clear that the outline of a meticulously planned European action plan has emerged. At the beginning of 1989, Western European countries launched a diplomatic campaign to actively promote Middle East peace talks. The focus is on putting pressure on Israel to bring it to the negotiating table.

Currently, the world is moving towards a multipolar political landscape of both competition and coexistence. The era when a few major powers dominated the Middle East situation is becoming history. Western Europe and the Middle East are geographically close, with far-reaching interests that surpass those of one or two major powers who have both interests and are not eager to resolve the Middle East conflicts. Generally, it is believed that the PLO's change in strategy, abandoning and opposing terrorism, the beginning of U.S.-PLO dialogue, and the declining influence of major powers in the Middle East—these major shifts in the Middle East situation in 1988—have created conditions for Western European countries to play an active role in this region. Moreover, Western Europe has unique advantages in promoting peace in the Middle East. Geopolitically, Western Europe and the Middle East are inseparable in terms of history, culture, religion, and ethnicity. In reality, Western Europe can communicate with all parties involved in the Arab-Israeli conflict.

Mediating the Arab-Israeli conflict is a responsibility that Western Europe cannot shirk. It is gratifying to see that Western Europe's actions to promote Middle East peace have begun, and unlike the United States, it has insightful criticisms of Israel. Western Europe's positive intentions will add new momentum to the difficult steps of Middle East peace talks.

### 西欧力促中东和谈

　　西欧力促中东和谈
    本报记者  林皎明
    中东政治舞台上，西欧国家的活动近来异常活跃。在促进中东早日和谈的大势中，西欧正在形成一股不可忽视的力量。
    十三日，英国外交国务大臣威廉·沃尔德格雷夫在突尼斯会晤巴解组织执委会主席阿拉法特。双方达成协议，共同努力促成中东和会在今年召开。这件事情的意义，不仅在于英国政府高级官员第一次与阿拉法特本人面谈，而且在于英国明确宣布巴解组织“应该参加”中东和会。这位作风严谨的英国外交官甚至风趣地说，要在“巴勒斯坦人认为是自己国土的地方”买一块绣花靠垫。其含义不同寻常。
    联系到英国外交大臣杰弗里·豪新近海湾西亚之行的言论，人们明显感觉到英国中东政策的风向在变，促进中东和谈的重点已转为敦促以色列改变立场。按照沃尔德格雷夫的话说，英国要提醒以色列，“不要错过中东和平的班车”。
    两天之后，欧共体部长理事会主席、西班牙外长弗朗西斯科·奥涅斯率欧洲共同体代表团也造访以色列。他声明没有携带任何方案，只授命实地考察中东局势，探询以色列是否有和谈意向。然而，他刚一结束与阿盟秘书长卡利比的会谈，就到达以色列，与以色列领导层接触，这清清楚楚地表明了他的促和之意。施加影响的重点，仍然是以色列。
    再过一周，法国外长罗朗·迪马也要登以色列的门，亲自了解以色列行将提出的“和平计划”究竟包含些什么内容。法国的中东政策历来与美国有别。前不久，法国决定提高巴解组织驻法代表处的外交待遇，它还促成以色列议员与巴解组织代表在巴黎直接会谈。有消息披露，法国政府有意出面与苏联共同召集中东和会筹备会。这个意向深得巴解的赞赏。目前法国正在幕后多方联系。
    此外，西德总理科尔表示，“西德将把外交重心移至参加中东和谈的新进程”。希腊总理帕潘德里欧十一日在雅典与阿拉法特会谈后说，希腊将“致力于巴勒斯坦国的最终确立”。
    本月底，在马德里还有一次欧洲共同体的重要外交活动。法国、希腊、西班牙外长将一起与阿拉法特主席会谈，然后出访以色列、埃及、约旦和叙利亚。由欧洲议会在五、六月间召集一次中东和会模拟会议的计划也在紧张筹备。
    由此可见，一份周密酝酿的欧洲行动方案的轮廓已经显现。一九八九年伊始，西欧国家展开了积极促进中东和谈的外交战役。它的重点，是对以色列施加压力，使其坐到谈判桌前来。
    当前，世界正朝着多极政治、既竞争又共处的缓和方向发展，少数大国左右中东局势的时代正在成为历史。西欧与中东咫尺天涯，利害关系远甚于在中东既有实利又不急于解决中东争端的一、二个大国。一般认为，巴解组织改变战略，摒弃和反对恐怖主义、美巴开始对话以及大国在中东的影响日益衰退，这些发生在一九八八年的中东局势的重大转折，为西欧国家在这一地区发挥积极作用创造了条件。不仅如此，西欧在中东促和有其不可替代的有利因素。从地缘政治上说，西欧与中东在历史、文化、宗教、种族关系上不可分割。在现实中，西欧与阿以争端各方都说得上话。
    调解阿以矛盾，西欧责无旁贷。令人欣喜的是，西欧促进中东和平的行动已经开始，而且与美国不同，对以色列的批评意见颇有见地。西欧的积极意向，将为中东和谈的艰难步伐增加新的推动力。
