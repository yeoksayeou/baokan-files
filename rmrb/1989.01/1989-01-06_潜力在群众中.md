Potential Lies with the Masses

Tangshan Iron and Steel Company, facing financial difficulties, relied fully on its workers to gather funds from all possible sources, ensuring that key projects could be completed and begin to yield benefits as soon as possible. Their approach is commendable.

As the saying goes, "Three cobblers with their wits combined exceed the wisdoms of Zhuge Liang." The potential to overcome difficulties lies with the masses. Look at Tangshan Steel: once everyone from top to bottom got involved, solutions emerged. This approach tests the adaptability of both enterprise managers and producers, encouraging them to think for the enterprise's development.

Currently, the focus is on rectifying the economic environment, rectifying economic order, reducing excessively high industrial growth rates to appropriate levels, and increasing effective supply. Enterprises universally face issues of insufficient funds, as well as shortages of raw materials and fuels. Without planning for a couple of years of austerity and without making efforts to tap into internal potentials, relying solely on external environmental improvements is not viable. When funds are insufficient, mobilizing workers to raise funds is one solution. This not only addresses the enterprise's urgent needs but also helps to reduce consumption. Moreover, enterprises spending such funds will be more careful, reducing waste and achieving more with less. This principle applies not only to funds but also to other difficulties. For instance, if raw materials are scarce, enterprises can adopt practical measures to mobilize workers to save energy and reduce consumption, and the potential is significant.

Of course, this does not mean that all enterprises facing financial difficulties can adopt the fundraising approach. Rather, it is suggested that enterprises capable of quickly yielding benefits and increasing effective supply during the rectification and adjustment period should rely on fundraising to overcome difficulties. For enterprises producing overcapacity products and for projects and products that do not align with industrial policy adjustment guidelines, adjustments should be made decisively: stop what should be stopped, delay what should be delayed, and convert what should be converted. There should be no more hesitation or procrastination.

### 潜力在群众中

　　潜力在群众中
    唐山钢铁公司在资金不足的困难面前，充分依靠职工，千方百计聚集资金，确保重点工程建设早日发挥效益。他们的做法好。
    俗话说：“三个臭皮匠，顶个诸葛亮。”克服困难的潜力在群众中。你看，唐钢的上上下下都动起来，办法不就来了吗！这样做，对企业的经营者和生产者的适应能力是个考验，促使他们为企业的发展动脑筋。
    目前，治理经济环境，整顿经济秩序，把过高的工业增长降到适当的速度，把有效的供给搞上去，企业面临的普遍问题是资金不足，以及原材料和燃料的困难。不打算过两三年紧日子，不在企业内部挖潜上下功夫，只指望外部环境的松动，那是不行的。资金不足，发动职工集资是一个办法，既解了企业的燃眉之急，又可以起到降低消费的作用。同时，企业花这样的钱，会精心算计，浪费就会大大减少，做到少花钱多办事。不仅是资金，就是其他方面的困难，只要依靠群众，也是可以克服的。比如原材料短缺，企业采取切实的手段，动员职工节能降耗，潜力也是很大的。
    当然，这里并不是说，眼下所有资金困难的企业，都可以采取集资的办法，而是指那些在治理整顿中能尽快发挥效益，增加有效供给的企业应靠集资渡难关。对于那些生产长线产品的企业和不符合产业政策调整方针的项目和产品，则应该在调整中坚决地压缩，该停的停，该缓的缓，该转的转，切不可再犹豫观望了。
