    The Huanghe Machinery Manufacturing Factory has established a multi-level mechanism for developing civilian products. Within the factory, both the factory-level and workshop-level units engage in civilian product development, utilizing military production equipment and personnel to implement horizontal collaborations. They also leverage social resources to enhance the research and production capabilities of civilian products. From 1981 to 1988, the factory developed over 40 types of Huanghe-branded electronic series products, increasing profits and taxes from 1.85 million yuan to over 70 million yuan.

    The Huanghe Machinery Factory is a military-industrial enterprise with over 7,000 employees. In the transition from military to civilian production, the factory has mobilized both the factory management and workshop-level units. The factory management focuses on developing high-volume "flagship" products, while encouraging workshops to develop small-batch products that suit their specific characteristics. Key projects are developed through contract-based initiatives. Through the combined efforts of the factory management and workshops, the factory's civilian products have quickly formed a series.

    To further enhance the research and production capabilities of civilian products, the factory has collaborated with over 100 factories, universities, and research institutions to form the "Huanghe" Electronic Enterprise Group. New product development is carried out through division of labor and collaborative efforts among member units, significantly accelerating the research process. The group, with Huanghe-branded electronic products as the "dragon head," coordinates production, expands the scale of production, and benefits the supporting factories.

　　厂内两级开发　厂外协同攻关    
    黄河厂多层次开发民品
    本报讯  黄河机器制造厂建立多层次开发民品机制，在厂内，厂级、车间都搞民品开发，利用军工生产设备和人力实行横向联合，利用社会力量增强民品的研制和生产能力。从１９８１年到１９８８年，开发出黄河牌电子系列产品４０多种，实现利税由１８５万元增加到７０００多万元。
    黄河机器厂是一家有７０００多人的军工企业，在“军转民”中，发挥厂部、车间两个积极性，厂部集中精力抓批量大的“拳头”产品，同时鼓励车间开发适合本车间特点的小批量产品。对关键项目实行承包开发。厂部、车间共同努力，使这个厂的民品在较短的时间里就形成了系列。
    为了进一步增强民品的研制和生产能力，这个厂与１００多家工厂、大专院校、科研单位联合，组建了“黄河”电子企业集团。新产品开发由成员单位分工合作，共同攻关，大大加快了研制进度。集团以黄河牌名牌电子产品为“龙头”，配套协作，扩大了生产规模，配套厂家也得到了实惠。　　　　　（赵新成）
