The Taipei Table Tennis Association invited mainland experts to visit Taiwan. Li Fu Rong hopes for no conditions attached.

The New China News Agency Hong Kong, January 11th - (Reporter Yao Da Tian) This morning, the General Secretary of the Chinese Taipei Table Tennis Association, Zhou Lin Zheng, had breakfast with the Director of the State Sports Commission Training Bureau, Li Fu Rong, and extended an oral invitation to Li Fu Rong, inviting the mainland's table tennis elite to visit Taiwan in September this year and hold an exhibition match.

Li Fu Rong welcomed and thanked Mr. Zhou Lin Zheng for the oral invitation. He said, "Developing sports exchanges across the Taiwan Strait will greatly benefit the improvement of the Chinese nation's sports level." Li Fu Rong also proposed that the invitation should be unconditional, that the Taipei Table Tennis Association should formally invite the Chinese Table Tennis Association in writing, and that it should comply with the relevant resolutions of the International Olympic Committee.

Zhou Lin Zheng mentioned that the Taipei Table Tennis Association plans to invite Jiang Jia Liang, Teng Yi, Jiao Zhi Min, Li Hui Fen, and coaches Xu Shao Fa and Zhang Xiao Lin, as well as the Director of the State Sports Commission Training Bureau, Li Fu Rong, to visit. They hope that through the visit of mainland table tennis players, the level of table tennis in Taiwan can be improved. Currently, there are 200,000 table tennis enthusiasts in Taiwan. At the same time as extending the oral invitation, Zhou Lin Zheng also handed over some "Application Forms for Visiting Travel Permits for Outstanding Mainlanders, Overseas Scholars, and Students" to Li Fu Rong. The "Notes" column in the form states that applicants who "participate in the Communist Party" will not be allowed. Li Fu Rong pointed out that many people from Taiwan have come to the mainland, and we do not have a regulation that those who do not participate in the Kuomintang cannot come to the mainland.

　　台北乒协邀请大陆好手访台
    李富荣希望不附加任何条件
    新华社香港１月１１日电  （记者姚达添）中国台北乒乓球协会总干事周麟徵今天早上在这里同国家体委训练局局长李富荣共进早餐时，向李富荣发出一项口头邀请，邀请大陆乒乓球精英于今年９月访问台湾，并进行表演赛。
    李富荣对周麟徵先生的口头邀请表示欢迎和感谢。他说，发展海峡两岸的体育交流，对增强中华民族的体育运动水平有很大裨益。李富荣同时提出了邀请必须是无条件的、必须由台北乒协向中国乒协发出正式书面邀请、必须遵守国际奥委会的有关决议等意见。
    周麟徵提到，台北乒协拟邀请江嘉良、滕毅、焦志敏、李惠芬以及教练许绍发、张燮林，中国国家体委训练局局长李富荣等前往访问。他们希望通过大陆乒乓球选手的访问，提高台湾乒乓球运动水平。目前台湾有２０万乒乓球运动爱好者。周麟徵在发出口头邀请的同时还把一些“大陆杰出人士、在海外学人及留学生来台参加访问旅行证申请书”的表格递交给李富荣。表格的注意事项栏内有申请人“参加共产党”等不予许可的先决条件。李富荣指出，在台人士前来大陆的人很多，我们并没有参加国民党者不能到大陆的规定。
