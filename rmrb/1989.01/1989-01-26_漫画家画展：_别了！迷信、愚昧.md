Some cartoonists today launched an attack on feudal superstitions, and their works are on display at the National Art Museum of China.

In recent years, feudal superstitions and outdated customs have resurfaced, especially in rural areas, and have become increasingly prevalent. Various ignorant behaviors continue to spread. This social phenomenon has caused deep concern among cartoonists.

Although in the past, during festivals and holidays, cartoonists have drawn similar themed cartoons, such a concentrated and large-scale critique of superstition and ignorance is relatively rare. The exhibition, themed "Farewell to Superstition and Ignorance," features 120 new works from nearly 100 cartoonists across the country.

Song Renqiong and Rui Xingwen visited the exhibition this morning and praised the cartoonists for doing a great job.

The cartoon exhibition is jointly organized by the China Science and Technology Popularization Research Institute and the Cartoon Art Committee of the China Artists Association. It will be simultaneously displayed in Beijing, Shenyang, Xi'an, Wuhan, and other cities.

　　漫画家画展：“别了！迷信、愚昧”
    本报北京１月２５日讯  记者陈祖甲报道：一些漫画家今天向封建迷信发起攻击，他们的作品陈列在中国美术馆。
    近些年来，封建迷信和陈规陋习在城市尤其在农村犹如沉渣泛起，愈演愈烈，种种愚昧表现不断蔓延。这种社会现象引起漫画家们的深切忧虑。
    尽管过去逢年过节，漫画家们也画过同类题材的漫画，但如此集中地大量地对迷信和愚昧进行抨击还不多见。主题为“别了！迷信、愚昧”的漫画展览，共展出１２０幅全国近百名漫画家的新作。
    宋任穷、芮杏文今天上午参观了这个展览，称赞漫画家们办了一件大好事。
    漫画展由中国科普研究所和中国美协漫画艺术委员会联合举办，同时在北京、沈阳、西安、武汉等城市展出。
