The bribery case involving Xu Shangli, the director of Shanghai Refrigerator Factory No. 2, has recently been solved by the Huangpu District People's Procuratorate.

In August of last year, the Huangpu District People's Procuratorate received a letter from the public exposing that Xu Shangli, the director of Shanghai Refrigerator Factory No. 2, had accepted bribes. Based on the content of the letter, procuratorial officials conducted a thorough investigation and confirmed that Xu Shangli was guilty of accepting bribes.

Shanghai Refrigerator Factory No. 2 is a key enterprise producing "Shanglin" brand refrigerators. The factory produced 153,000 refrigerators last year. The Shanghai Electrical Appliances Wholesale Station allocated 3,000 refrigerators to the factory based on its actual situation, to be used for horizontal cooperation and to secure raw materials. However, Xu Shangli, taking advantage of his position, sold over 800 refrigerators at wholesale prices to his relatives and friends. The difference between the wholesale and retail prices alone resulted in a loss of 120,000 yuan to the state. These relatives and friends, by reselling the refrigerators at a higher price, made a profit of 200,000 yuan, seriously disrupting the market economic order and causing significant economic losses to the state.

The procuratorial authorities also found that from March to August last year, Xu Shangli, using his authority, approved the sale of 240 refrigerators to a certain department store in the city, from which he received a bribe of 120,000 yuan. In addition, Xu Shangli has other significant suspicions of accepting bribes, which are currently being further investigated.

During a legal search of Xu Shangli's home, the procuratorial authorities discovered that his lifestyle was extremely extravagant. Hundreds of pounds of rice were rotting, many boxes of apples were moldy, and there were large quantities of foreign cigarettes, wine, canned beer, Nestle coffee, and clothing.

On January 6, after obtaining conclusive evidence, the Huangpu District Procuratorate lawfully summoned Xu Shangli. On January 7, they announced his criminal detention.

　　收受贿赂扰乱市场　利用亲友倒卖冰箱
    上海冰箱二厂厂长薛尚礼被拘留
    本报讯  上海电冰箱二厂厂长薛尚礼收受贿赂案，日前被黄浦区人民检察院侦破。
    去年８月，黄浦区人民检察院举报中心接待站收到了一封人民来信，揭发上海冰箱二厂厂长薛尚礼收受贿赂。根据举报信的内容，检察干部经过周密侦查，确认薛尚礼犯有受贿罪。
    上海电冰箱二厂是生产“上菱”牌冰箱的重点企业。该厂去年共生产了１５．３万台电冰箱。上海家电批发站根据该厂的实际情况，反销给该厂３０００台电冰箱，用于搞横向协作，争取原材料。可是，薛尚礼凭借手中的权力，将８００余台电冰箱以批发价出售给自己的亲戚、朋友。仅以批发价和零售价的差价，就使国家损失１２万元。而这些亲戚朋友通过转手加价倒卖，牟取暴利达２０万元，严重扰乱了市场经济秩序，给国家造成了重大经济损失。
    检察机关还查明，薛尚礼在去年３月至８月，利用职权，批签销售给本市某百货公司门市部承包人郑某２４０台冰箱，从中收受贿赂１．２万元。此外，薛尚礼还有其他收受贿赂的重大嫌疑，正在进一步追查中。
    检察机关在对薛尚礼家中实行依法搜查时，发现他的生活极端奢侈，几百斤大米在腐烂，许多箱苹果在发霉，还有大量的外烟、洋酒、易拉罐啤酒、雀巢咖啡和衣物等。
    １月６日，黄浦区检察院在掌握确凿证据后，依法传唤了薛尚礼。并于７日宣布对其实行刑事拘留。
