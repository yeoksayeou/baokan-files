    The State Education Commission Vice Minister He Dongchang Answers Questions from Reporters: Moral Education Work Needs a Major Shift

    Xinhua News Agency reports: Reporter Wang Namei reports: The "Notice from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Reforming and Strengthening Moral Education in Primary and Secondary Schools" is the guiding principle for moral education work in primary and secondary schools for a considerable period in the future, and it will have a profound impact on moral education work in primary and secondary schools. How to correctly understand and implement the spirit of the notice, State Education Commission Vice Minister He Dongchang recently answered questions posed by reporters from our newspaper.

    Q: What is the practical significance of emphasizing moral education work in primary and secondary schools at present?

    A: The "Notice from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Reforming and Strengthening Moral Education in Primary and Secondary Schools" has put forward new requirements for the ideological and moral education of primary and secondary school students. First, we should recognize the importance of this issue. This is related to the physical and mental health of a large number of young people. Currently, there are 180 million primary and secondary school students, and in addition, 20 million students enter primary school each year. By the end of this century, there will be nearly 200 million young people. They will determine the future of the country and the overall civilization construction of society. At present, there are many problems in moral education work in primary and secondary schools, mainly neglecting moral education and pursuing academic performance rates. This is also a social issue, involving every family and all sectors of society. How to provide a good environment for the growth of young people's ideological and moral character requires the whole society to pay attention.

    Q: What changes are needed in moral education work in primary and secondary schools in the new era?

    A: Moral education work in primary and secondary schools in the new era needs two major changes. First, emphasizing moral education is an essential requirement of a socialist school. In the new situation, moral education emphasizes solving students' ideological and moral character and political awareness, which is very different from the past when it only emphasized politics. This is a major change. Second, the cultivation goals of moral education have been determined. First, students are required to be good citizens. Having social public morals, civilized behavior habits, and abiding by laws and regulations are the basic requirements for a citizen. On this basis, guide students to gradually establish a scientific outlook on life and worldview, and continuously improve socialist ideological awareness. According to the current situation of developing socialist commodity economy, developing democratic politics, and implementing openness in our country, the requirements, content, methods, and approaches of moral education should have a major change. For moral education work, primary and secondary schools should pay attention, and all sectors of society, especially radio, television, newspapers, and the news media should also pay attention.

    Q: Moral education work in primary and secondary schools has many aspects. How to implement it?

    A: Recognizing the importance of moral education work and the need for major changes in moral education work in the new era, we must implement it. Central leaders have said: "In all work, we must pay great attention to education work, in education work, we must pay great attention to primary and secondary school education work, and in primary and secondary school education work, we must pay great attention to moral education work." Principals of primary and secondary schools must pay attention to moral education work. It is hoped that each province, municipality, and autonomous region can formulate regulations and plans for moral education work. There should be legal guarantees. Currently, the Youth League Central Committee is drafting the Juvenile Protection Law. To protect our young people, this is not just a matter for the education department; the whole society must also work together to manage it. The key is still school education. In the future, each school should have an implementation plan. Currently, the first thing to do is to improve behavioral norms. We should consider improving legal education in primary and secondary schools, and in the teaching of all subjects, we should carry out patriotic education and moral education. The content of textbooks for all subjects should be further improved according to these. Currently, the Education Commission is compiling new textbooks for after 1991. The textbooks and extracurricular reading materials will select a batch of stories to make children clear what is right and what is wrong through them. This will be beneficial to improving the overall moral level of society.

    We must also cultivate a backbone team for moral education. We should let the most authoritative and most popular teachers with students teach moral education courses. This year, the college entrance examination will increase legal content and will examine the public security regulations. College students not understanding the law is related to primary and secondary school education. Implementing a series of measures such as the behavioral norms for primary and secondary school students and public morality education for students will draw the attention of the whole society and parents to moral education. In which region the juvenile crime rate is high, it shows that the primary and secondary school education in that region is not well done.

    In summary, for this document of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, first, we must pay attention, second, we must change our mindset, third, we must grasp the implementation and implement it seriously, so that moral education work in primary and secondary schools will have a great improvement, promote the growth of young people, and invigorate the national spirit.

　　国家教委副主任何东昌答记者问
    德育工作要有一个较大转变
    本报讯  记者王娜梅报道：《中共中央关于改革和加强中小学德育工作的通知》是今后相当长一个时期内中小学德育工作的指导方针，将对中小学德育工作产生深远影响。如何正确理解和贯彻通知精神，国家教委副主任何东昌日前回答了本报记者提出的问题。
    问：目前强调中小学德育工作有何现实意义？
    答：《中共中央关于改革和加强中小学德育工作的通知》对中小学青少年儿童的思想品德教育工作提出了新的要求，首先应该认识这个问题的重要性。因为这关系到广大青少年的身心健康。现在，有１．８亿中小学生，加上今后每年有２０００万学生进入小学，到本世纪末差不多还会有二亿多青少年。他们决定着国家的未来以及整个社会的文明建设。目前中小学德育工作中存在不少问题，主要是忽视品德教育、片面追求升学率等等。这又是个社会问题，涉及到每个家庭和社会各界。如何为青少年提供思想品德成长的良好环境，需要呼吁整个社会予以重视。
    问：新时期中小学的德育工作需要有哪些转变？
    答：新时期中小学德育工作需要有两个重大转变。一是重视品德教育是社会主义学校的本质要求。在新形势下，德育教育强调解决学生的思想品德和学生的政治认识，跟过去只强调政治有很大区别，这是一个大转变。二是确定了德育的培养目标。首先要求学生做一个好公民。有社会公德、有文明行为习惯、遵纪守法，这是对公民的基本要求。在这个基础上引导学生逐步确立科学的人生观、世界观，并不断提高社会主义思想觉悟。根据目前我国发展社会主义商品经济、发展民主政治和实行开放的实际情况，德育要求和内容、方式、方法都应有一个较大的变化。对于德育工作，中小学要重视，社会各界，特别是广播、电视、报刊等新闻界也要予以重视。
    问：中小学德育工作头绪很多，如何落实？
    答：认识到德育工作的重要性和新时期德育工作要有重大的转变，就要付诸实施。中央领导同志讲：“在各项工作中要十分重视教育工作，教育工作中要十分重视中小学教育工作，中小学教育工作中要十分重视德育工作。”中小学校长更要重视德育工作。希望各个省市区能够制定德育工作条例、规划。要有法律保障。现在正由团中央起草未成年人保护法。要保护我们的青少年，这不仅是教育部门的事情，整个社会也要综合治理。关键仍是学校教育。今后各校要有实施规划。当前首先要把行为规范搞好。要考虑搞好中小学的守法教育，在各科课程教学里要贯彻爱国主义教育、道德教育。各科教材的内容编写都要根据这些作进一步改进。现在，教委正在编１９９１年后的新教材，教材和课外读物中将精选一批故事，通过它们使孩子们明确什么是对的，什么是不对的。这样对提高整个社会道德水平都有好处。
    还要培养德育教育的骨干队伍，要让最有威信、最受学生欢迎的教师对学生讲品德课。今年高考将增加法律内容，要考治安条例。大学生不懂法和中小学教育有关。贯彻中小学生行为规范、对学生进行公德教育等一系列措施的落实，会引起整个社会和家长对品德教育的重视。哪个地区青少年犯罪率高，就说明哪个地区中小学教育没搞好。
    总之，对中共中央这个文件一要重视，二要转变观念，三要狠抓落实，认真实施，使中小学德育工作有很大改观，促进青少年的成长，振奋民族精神。
