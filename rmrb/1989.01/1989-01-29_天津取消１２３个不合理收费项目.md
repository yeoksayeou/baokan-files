The Tianjin municipal government canceled 123 unreasonable fee items imposed by administrative and public institutions last year, reducing the burden on enterprises and the public by more than 15 million yuan.

The fee items and standards of administrative and public institutions in Tianjin are all managed by the municipal price bureau. The bureau stipulates that no administrative department, public institution, or district government has the authority to set administrative and public fee items and standards. In 1988, the Tianjin price department thoroughly reviewed the fee situations of 202 units and announced that any items and standards not approved by the municipal fee review office or the price bureau are invalid.

    天津取消１２３个不合理收费项目
  　天津市政府去年共取消行政、事业单位不合理收费项目１２３个，减少企业和群众负担１５００多万元。
    天津市的行政、事业收费项目和标准，都由市物价局统一管理。该局规定：各行政部门、事业单位和各区县政府一律无权制定行政事业收费项目和标准。１９８８年，天津市物价部门认真清理了２０２个单位的收费情况后明确宣布，凡是未经市清理收费办公室或物价局批准的项目和标准，一律作废。
