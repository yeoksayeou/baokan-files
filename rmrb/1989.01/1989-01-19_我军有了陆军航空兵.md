The PLA now has an army aviation force, and this ground combat unit, which has long been engaged in land operations, has grown wings of steel.

Over the past year, the PLA's army aviation force has established its first batch of helicopter units. Recently, a reporter visited a helicopter regiment of a certain group army in North China and witnessed the PLA's first generation of pilots, dressed in army uniforms, flying their warbirds across the sky. They are full of vigor and have good military skills. After being trained by aviation colleges, most of the pilots can independently execute missions under different weather conditions. A young pilot told the reporter that after joining the army ranks, they are striving to study the characteristics of combined operations and improve their ability to coordinate with other army units, so as to meet the needs of modern combat training.

The establishment of this helicopter regiment indicates that the PLA's army is further advancing towards modernization. Since the founding of New China, the PLA's army has developed from a single infantry force into artillery, armored, engineering, and other branches, achieving ground combined operations. The emergence of the army aviation force further enables the PLA's army to achieve three-dimensional combined operations in the air and on the ground, enhancing the army's rapid mobility and combat capabilities.

In the year since its establishment, the army aviation force has been strengthening military training while carrying out border patrols, disaster relief, scientific experiments, and other tasks. They have dispatched thousands of aircraft to support local construction and timely assist the army and local development.

　　我军有了陆军航空兵
    新华社北京１月１８日电  （记者徐京跃）人民解放军陆军有了航空兵，这支长期从事地面作战的部队插上钢铁的翅膀。
    近一年，我军陆军航空兵组建了第一批直升机部队。记者最近在华北某地采访某集团军直升机大队时，目睹了我军第一代身着陆军军服的飞行员驾驶战鹰，演兵长空。他们朝气蓬勃，具有良好的军事素质，经过航空院校的培训，大多数飞行员能在不同气象条件下单独执行任务。一位年轻的飞行员告诉记者，他们加入陆军序列后，正努力研究合成作战的特点，提高与陆军其他兵种协同作战的能力，以适应现代作战训练的需要。
    这个集团军直升机大队的组建表明，人民解放军陆军进一步向现代化迈进。新中国成立后，人民解放军陆军由单一的步兵逐步发展为炮兵、装甲兵、工程兵等，实现了地面合成作战。陆军航空兵的应运而生，使人民解放军陆军进一步实现空中和地面立体合成作战，提高我军快速机动作战能力。
    陆军航空兵组建一年来，一边加强军事训练，一边执行边防执勤、抢险救灾、科学试验等各项任务，为地方出动飞机数千架次，及时支援了部队和地方建设。
