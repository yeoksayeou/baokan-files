Local water departments lead by example in studying the Water Law and resolving longstanding water issues.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 21st: "Local water departments take the lead in studying the Water Law, streamlining departmental relationships, establishing administrative law enforcement entities, and resolving some longstanding water issues through legal means." This is what a water department official recently disclosed to reporters about the situation of implementing the Water Law across the country over the past year.

Since the promulgation of the "Water Law of the People's Republic of China" on January 21, 1988, local water departments at all levels have made learning, propagating, and implementing the Water Law a central task. Various regions have adopted methods such as organizing study sessions and seminars, linking theory with practice, summarizing experiences, and organizing county (city) level water bureau chiefs to study the Water Law, thereby enhancing their awareness of law-abiding and law-enforcement. Guangdong, Guizhou, Shaanxi, Shanghai, and Xinjiang provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, while organizing all staff to study the Water Law, also held Water Law examinations with good results. In the process of implementing the Water Law, local governments gradually streamlined departmental relationships and established administrative law enforcement entities. In June 1988, the State Council clearly designated the Ministry of Water Resources as the national water administrative authority, responsible for the unified management and protection of national water resources; the State Council established the National Water Resources and Soil Conservation Leading Group as the national leadership body for water resources and soil conservation. Currently, 29 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have designated water departments as the local water administrative authorities and the main law enforcement bodies.

While propagating the Water Law, various regions have also proposed implementation focuses based on their actual situations. Many places have promoted river dredging, water conservancy project and river protection, and water fee collection through the propagation of the Water Law. For example, Shandong Province has, in recent years, legally handled over 30 cases of dynamiting fish in reservoirs, damaging dikes, obstructing rivers, stealing water conservancy facilities, and assaulting management personnel. They have removed 14,200 trees obstructing rivers and demolished 19,500 obstructions. It is understood that the national water system has established 568 public security protection agencies, and more than 60% of large reservoirs have set up police stations.

　　各级水利部门带头学水法  依法处理水利老大难问题
    据新华社北京１月２１日电（记者余富棠）“各级水利部门带头学习水法，理顺部门关系，确立行政执法主体，依法处理一些长期不决的水利问题”。这是水利部有关人士日前向记者透露我国各地一年来贯彻执行水法的情况。
    《中华人民共和国水法》自１９８８年１月２１日颁布以来，我国各级水利部门把学习宣传和贯彻执行水法作为一项中心工作。各地采取举办学习班、研讨班等形式，联系实际，总结经验，组织县（市）以上水利局长学习水法，提高守法与执法的自觉性。广东、贵州、陕西、上海、新疆等省、市、自治区在组织全体职工学习水法的同时，还举行了水法考试，效果较好。在贯彻执行水法的过程中，各地政府逐步理顺部门关系，确立行政执法主体。１９８８年６月，国务院明确水利部是国务院的水行政主管部门，负责全国水资源的统一管理和保护；国务院成立了全国水资源与水土保持领导小组，为全国水资源与水土保持的领导机构。目前，全国有２９个省、市、自治区都确定了水利部门为当地水行政主管部门，和执法的主体。
    在宣传水法的同时，各地还结合实际，分别提出贯彻实施水法的重点。许多地方通过宣传水法，推动了河道清障、水利工程及河道保护、水费征收等工作。如山东省近年依法查处水库炸鱼、破坏堤防、河道设障、盗窃水利设施及殴打管理人员的案件达３０多起，清除河道阻水的树木１．４２万株，拆除阻水建筑物１．９５万处。据了解，全国水利系统已建立５６８个公安保卫机构，６０％以上的大型水库设立了派出所。
