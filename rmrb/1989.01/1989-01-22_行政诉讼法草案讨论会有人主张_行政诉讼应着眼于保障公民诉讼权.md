The State Council's Legislative Affairs Office convened a meeting from January 19 to 21, inviting representatives from the legal departments of some provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities, and cities with separate planning status to discuss the draft of the Administrative Litigation Law.

Some participants pointed out that the current draft of the Administrative Litigation Law does not sufficiently embody the principle of equality and leans slightly towards citizens and organizations as plaintiffs. To prevent "false accusations" and "frivolous lawsuits," it is necessary to impose certain restrictions on the rights of plaintiffs. Conversely, some participants argued that, given the reality in China where citizens or organizations often suffer illegal infringements by administrative organs and are intimidated by the power of these organs, they dare not sue. Therefore, administrative litigation should focus on protecting citizens' right to sue and providing them with convenient legal procedures, rather than imposing various restrictions. Of course, deliberate false accusations should be subject to legal penalties.

The meeting focused on discussing some controversial issues in the draft. In particular, when discussing whether administrative regulations should be used as the basis for court trials of administrative cases, the participants pointed out that administrative regulations are an important part of China's legal system and are the specific implementation of laws and regulations. Many actual management activities of government departments are conducted based on administrative regulations. If administrative regulations are not used as the basis for trial, on the one hand, the legal protection of administrative organs' management activities will not be effective, and on the other hand, courts will have difficulty handling a large number of administrative disputes. Therefore, the participants unanimously agreed that administrative regulations, as long as they do not conflict with the Constitution, laws, and administrative regulations, should be used as the basis for court trials of administrative cases.

　　行政诉讼法草案讨论会有人主张    
    行政诉讼应着眼于保障公民诉讼权
    新华社北京１月２１日电（记者周长新）国务院法制局于１９日至２１日召集部分省、自治区、直辖市和计划单列市的政府法制部门的负责人就行政诉讼法草案进行了讨论。
    有些与会人士指出，目前提交讨论的行政诉讼法草案体现平等原则不够，有点偏向作为起诉人的公民和团体，为了防止“错告”、“乱告”，应对起诉人的权利作相应限制。一些相反的意见认为，鉴于我国现实中的主要问题是公民或团体受到行政机关的违法侵害时，慑于行政机关的权力，不愿告，不敢告，所以，行政诉讼应着眼于保障公民的诉讼权，为他们提供诉讼方便，而不是作种种限制，当然，蓄意诬告理应受到法律制裁。
    座谈会对草案中的一些有争议的问题进行了集中讨论。特别是谈到行政规章应否作为法院审理行政案件的依据问题时，与会者指出，行政规章是我国法律体系的重要组成部分，是法律和法规的具体化，政府部门的许多实际管理活动都是依据行政规章进行的，如果不把行政规章作为审理案件的依据，一方面行政机关的管理活动得不到有效的法律保障，另一方面法院对大量的行政纠纷也难以审理。据此，与会者一致认为，行政规章在不与宪法、法律和行政法规相抵触的条件下，应作为法院审理行政案件的依据。
