The State Education Commission's responsible official recently spoke to reporters about the work related to the end of the semester and the upcoming winter vacation for higher education institutions.

The official stated that the party and administrative leaders of higher education institutions, along with the broad teaching staff, should further strengthen the end-of-term teaching work and organize examinations properly. Schools should combine review and examination with education on strict study and examination discipline for all students, and uphold school rules and regulations. In recent days, some international students in a few schools have missed classes for various reasons. The relevant schools should carefully arrange their make-up classes and require them to participate in make-up classes and examinations according to the school's regulations within the specified time.

The official hopes that students will enrich themselves during the winter vacation, engage with society and the masses, gain knowledge and skills, and learn to observe the situation scientifically. At the same time, he also hopes that local governments and relevant departments at all levels will care for and support primary, secondary, and university students in spending a good winter vacation, and provide necessary conditions for their cultural and sports activities and visits under possible circumstances. Schools should arrange the living conditions and various activities for students who stay on campus and international students who are far from their home countries.
