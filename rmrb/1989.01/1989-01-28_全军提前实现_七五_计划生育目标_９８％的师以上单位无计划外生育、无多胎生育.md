The PLA Ahead of Schedule in Achieving the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" Population Control Targets

    98% of Division-Level Units Have No Unplanned Births or Multiple Births

    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 27th – Peng Peiyun, the director of the State Family Planning Commission, stated that the People's Liberation Army has demonstrated a commendable spirit of patriotism in implementing the basic state policy of family planning, showing a sense of responsibility and concern for the nation. This spirit is worthy of emulation by the entire nation.

    Peng made these remarks at a telephone conference on family planning work held this afternoon.

    According to Zong Shunliu, Deputy Director of the General Logistics Department, the PLA's family planning rate, contraceptive rate, and the rate of obtaining single-child certificates have all been maintained above 99% for six consecutive years. The PLA has completed the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" for family planning work, as approved by the Central Military Commission, two years ahead of schedule. In the PLA, 98% of division-level units have achieved the goal of having no unplanned births, no multiple births, and no late-term abortions. A total of 1,162 units in the PLA have been recognized as advanced units in family planning by county-level or higher people's governments. Additionally, there have been new advancements in the work of promoting healthy births and child-rearing.

    Zhou Keyu, Director of the General Political Department and head of the PLA Family Planning Leading Group, emphasized the need for the PLA to continue to emphasize the propaganda and education of family planning, as well as in-depth and meticulous ideological work. He called for overcoming the tendency in some units to rely too heavily on administrative and economic measures, and for truly making the Party's policies a voluntary action for all. He also urged leaders at all levels to guard against complacency and to strengthen their leadership of this work. He called on the entire PLA, including soldiers, workers, and family members, to continue to model the Party and government's policies, regulations, and guidelines on family planning, and to contribute to China's efforts to improve the economic environment, rectify economic order, deepen reforms, and create a good population environment.

    At today's telephone conference, Han Huizhi, Vice Chief of the General Staff of the PLA, read out a notice from the General Staff Department, the General Political Department, and the General Logistics Department commending the PLA's advanced units and individuals in family planning work for 1988.
