    With the assistance of the Supervision Department, the China Coal Group recently investigated a serious case of negligence. Former General Manager of the China Coal Industry Collective Enterprise Consulting Service Company, Left Chang'an (currently the Party Secretary of the Coal Planning Institute), and Deputy General Manager Wang Dongxiong received party and administrative disciplinary actions.

    The China Coal Industry Collective Enterprise Consulting Service Company, in May 1985, violated national regulations by lending 2.5 million yuan to the fraudster Cao Changjiang (who was later sentenced to 15 years in prison) without conducting a credit investigation. Cao Changjiang used the funds to cover external debts. Despite extensive efforts, only 1.33 million yuan has been recovered, resulting in a loss of 11.7 million yuan to the state. In July of the same year, the company advanced 1.85 million yuan for coal transportation fees for the Xinjiang Sanma Company, of which 900,000 yuan has not been recovered. Additionally, the company recklessly allocated 1 million yuan to its subsidiary in Shenzhen, which was misappropriated for debt repayment and has not been recovered. Relevant departments concluded that the economic losses were primarily the responsibility of Left Chang'an, the former General Manager of the China Coal Industry Collective Enterprise Consulting Service Company, and the important responsibility of Wang Dongxiong, the Deputy General Manager.

    Between 1984 and 1985, Left Chang'an and Wang Dongxiong, while importing fast-food equipment from a company in Hong Kong, knowingly exceeded their authority by altering the port of arrival and increasing the equipment. They illegally approved an additional 700,000 yuan beyond the original contract. The equipment was only unpacked and inspected a year after arrival, revealing issues such as poor quality and crude workmanship.

    Therefore, the China Coal Group and the Party Committee of the Group decided to demote Left Chang'an from a deputy ministerial level to a deputy bureau level and remove him from his position as Party Secretary of the Coal Planning Institute. Wang Dongxiong was demoted from a deputy ministerial level to a bureau level and received a serious warning within the party.

    The Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate, after reviewing the case, concluded that Left Chang'an's serious negligence resulted in significant state property losses, constituting dereliction of duty. However, considering his cooperative attitude, the decision was made not to prosecute.

　　在监察部协助下
    中煤总公司查处严重失职案
    左长安王东雄受到党纪政纪处分
    本报北京１月１１日讯  记者舒瑜从监察部获悉：中国统配煤矿总公司在监察部的协助下，近日查处了一起严重失职案。原煤炭部中国煤矿集体企业咨询服务总公司总经理左长安（现任煤炭规划院党委书记）、副总经理王东雄受到党纪政纪处分。
    中国煤矿集体企业咨询服务总公司于１９８５年５月违反国家有关规定，在未做资信调查的情况下，草率决定将２５０万元借给诈骗犯曹长江（已被判处有期徒刑１５年），经营汽车生意。曹长江拿到巨款后，充抵了外债。后经多方努力，到目前只追回１３３万元，给国家造成经济损失１１７万元。同年７月，又为新疆三马公司垫付煤炭运费１８．５万元，其中９万元至今未能收回。此外，还盲目为下属深圳分公司拨款１００万元，被挪用还债，至今也追不回来。有关部门认为，对上述经济损失，原煤炭部中国煤矿集体企业咨询服务总公司总经理左长安负有主要责任，副总经理王东雄负有重要责任。
    左长安、王东雄还于１９８４年至１９８５年间，在从香港某公司引进快餐设备时，明知本单位不具备对外签订合同的职权，违反规定，以改变货物到港地和增加设备为理由，越权增拨原合同外费用人民币７万元。设备到货１年后才开箱检验，发现设备质量低劣、工艺粗糙等问题。
    为此，中国统配煤矿总公司和总公司党委决定，给予左长安正局级降为正处级处分，撤销其煤炭规划院党委书记职务；给予王东雄副局级降为正处级和党内严重警告的处分。
    北京市人民检察院分院审理此案后认为，左长安在工作中严重失职，导致国家财产遭受重大损失，已构成玩忽职守罪。但鉴于他认罪态度较好，决定免予起诉。
