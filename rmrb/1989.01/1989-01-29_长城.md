The Great Wall

Because the season of late autumn has arrived, and the time to descend the mountain is late, I see the setting sun melting gold, illuminating you in fiery red. Under the whipping western winds, the wild grass between the bricks begins to wither, and the hawthorns beneath the foundation stones change color. At this moment, I do not hear the low hum of autumn insects, but in looking up to the sky, I see the returning geese amidst the yellow clouds.

Is that the old road that Zhao Jun took to the frontier? Is that flying towards the Northern Sea where Su Wu tended his flock? In my standing contemplation, I imagine that the flying geese are witnesses to the endless passage of time. Once upon a time, black clouds obscured the moonlight, and rain and snow fell in torrents. The barbarian horses neighed, and the horns wailed. Beacons were lit on the mountain peaks, and arrows shattered on the stones. When the generals fell in battle, the concubines slit their throats, the banners lay flat, and the corpses propped each other up, the battlefield fell silent. Only the wild dogs with red eyes devoured the "dreamed-of person in the spring chamber."

Therefore, I say, you are a scroll of sorrowful history, Great Wall!

Thus, in people's stubborn fantasy, you were built. This was a fantasy of self-protection and self-psychological balance. The walls are six or seven meters high, four or five meters thick, following the contours of the mountains, and treacherous in countless ways. From the shores of the Bohai Sea, cutting through the desert, you wind for six thousand seven hundred kilometers. Watchtowers stand tall, and outposts stretch on. You use one fortress after another to block the ancient passes, forming the key to the northern gate. This made merchants traveling for trade frown, but it made the emperors of each dynasty feel secure. They thought that their "Central Kingdom" under their rule was impregnable, needing nothing from others, and would last forever.

Therefore, I say, you are also a symbol of national isolation, Great Wall!

But fantasy is, after all, just fantasy, and isolation cannot truly isolate. The spirits of many princesses who married into barbarian tribes return in the moonlight, their jade pendants tinkling. Many frozen bowstrings shoot arrows that pierce throats. The passes are trampled, the fortresses are demolished, and the swords that whistle in the wind overturn the autumn waves of the imperial lake. Thus, people discover: the border walls are no longer barriers, and the northern passes are no longer wonders. They become laughable, as if mocked by time and space. Under the erosion of wind and sand, they age prematurely.

Therefore, I say, you are a sign of cultural stupidity, Great Wall!

Because of this, now you open your heart. You welcome billions of tourists from all directions without shame. Among them are presidents, businessmen, teachers, students, and perhaps cheerful actors and sports stars. Cameras click, but the sound is drowned out by laughter. I do not know their individual purposes, but they come, they come. Their arrival makes you seem very open and full of confidence. I see a graceful foreigner stepping onto the top of the beacon tower, blowing kisses to someone; he also raises both arms to form a V, as if laughing heartily towards a beautiful future.

Oh, Great Wall! I do not know what you think of this. Are you willing to receive the diverse crowds from distant lands? Can you bear the historical surges and the stirrings of the new century?

You remain silent. The tangled mountains where you are rooted remain silent, and the clear, bright sky does not speak.

But people tell me: the only man-made mark visible from outer space on Earth is you, the Great Wall!

　　长城
    鲍昌
    因为深秋的季节已至，下山的时间已晚，我看见落日熔金，照得你如火嫣红。在猎猎西风扑刺下，砖缝间的野草开始黄枯，基石下的酸枣变了颜色。这时，听不见秋虫之低吟，却在仰天一瞥时，看到了黄云间的归鸿。
    那是沿循昭君出塞的老路吗？那是飞向苏武牧羊的北海吗？在伫立的凝思中，我想象那飞鸿乃是悠悠岁月的见证。曾几何时，黑云掩没了月色，雨雪纷纷地袭来，胡马长嘶，觱篥哀鸣，狼烟在山头升起，矢刃在石间摧折；当将军战死、燕姬自刎、旌旗横倒、死尸相撑，战场上的一切声音沉寂之后，只有红了眼睛的野犬在吞噬谁家的“春闺梦里人”了。
    所以我说，你是一卷凄惋的历史，长城！
    于是，在人们的一种执拗的幻想里，你被建造出来。那是自我保护、自我心理平衡的幻想。墙高六七米，墙厚四五米，随山就坡，险峻万状，自渤海之滨，夐绝荒漠，蜿蜒竟达六千七百公里。戍楼高耸，斥堠连绵。你用一座座雄关，卡住咽喉古道，构成北门锁钥。这使得互市的商旅，为之蹙眉；却又使历代的皇帝心中安泰，他们自以为统治下的“中央之国”，固若金汤，无求于人，万寿无疆。
    所以我说，你又是民族封闭的象征，长城！
    但幻想毕竟是幻想，封闭终不能封闭。几多和番公主的幽魂，带着环佩的响声在月夜中归来了。几多寒霜冻硬的弓弦，射出了断喉的利箭。蓟门被踏平，燕台被摧垮，呼啸着风声的宝剑，掀翻了太液秋波。由是人们发现：边墙不再是屏障，紫塞不再是嵚奇。它变得可笑，仿佛受尽了时间与空间的嘲弄。在风沙剥蚀下，它过早地衰老了。
    所以我说，你是一个文化愚钝的标志，长城！
    正因为如此吧，现在你敞开胸襟了。你毫不羞怯地迎来了四面八方的亿万游人。他们之中有总统，有商人，有教师，有学生，亦或有开心的演员与体育明星。照相机咔嚓咔嚓响着，但又被哗哗的笑声淹没。我不知道他们各自的目的，但是他们来了，来了。他们的来，使你显得十分开放，而又充满自信。我看到一位丰姿潇洒的外宾，踏上烽火台的顶端，向什么人频频飞吻；他并高举双臂，做成一个Ｖ字，仿佛向着美好的未来，发出爽朗的笑声。
    哦，长城！我不知你对此作何感想。你那虽然古老但仍坚固的躯体，愿意接待异域殊方的杂色人流吗？你能承受住历史的再冲荡和新世纪的胎动吗？
    你不语。你扎根的糺缦群山不语，并晴洁气爽的长天也不语。
    但人们告诉我：外层空间能看到的地球上唯一的人工痕迹，就是你呵，长城！
