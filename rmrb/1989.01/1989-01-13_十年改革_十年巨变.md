Ten Years of Reform, Ten Years of Change

Six Major Changes

Daguozhuang has been liberated for 40 years. In these 40 years, our village's history is clearly divided into two parts: the first 30 years and the last 10 years. In the first 30 years, efforts to get rich were futile. After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, in these 10 years, seeking wealth has truly led to prosperity, resulting in unexpected changes. To put it simply, there are six aspects:

First, the economy has seen tremendous development. The total industrial and agricultural output value for the first 30 years was 12.5 million yuan, but in 1987 it reached 200 million yuan, and in 1988 it exceeded 400 million yuan, an increase of over 30 times. In the first 30 years, the average annual tax revenue was 100,000 yuan, but in 1987 it was 9.97 million yuan, and in 1988 it was over 10 million yuan, an increase of over 1,000 times. In the first 30 years, the total net income was 7.23 million yuan, but in 1987 it was 41.45 million yuan, and in 1988 it was approximately 75 million yuan, an increase of nearly 10 times.

Second, industry has formed enterprise groups, and agriculture has formed large-scale operations. Currently, there are 4 industrial companies and over 150 factories. Three companies have an output value of over 100 million yuan each, and one company has an output value of 80 million yuan. In agriculture, there are 4,400 mu of land. In 1978, the grain production was 1.2 million jin, but in 1988 it was 2.4 million jin, an increase of onefold.

Third, education and culture have seen significant development. In the past, people around 50 years old in our village basically had no education. Now, young people around 30 years old have all received 9 years of compulsory education, reaching at least junior high school level. The village has invested over 20 million yuan to build new kindergartens and primary and secondary schools.

Fourth, people's living standards have greatly improved. The historical problem of food and clothing has been completely solved in recent years. Now, the general standard of living has reached a moderately prosperous level, with good food, clothing, housing, and entertainment. Each household has savings of over 10 million yuan. Previously single men have all found partners, and the elderly have social security.

Fifth, the poor village has become a new town. In the past, the village roads were uneven, and all the houses were dilapidated. Now, the residences include courtyard-style tile houses, high-rise apartment buildings, and villas, with an average living space of 26 square meters per person. The village's dozens of streets and alleys are all paved with asphalt.

Sixth, people's quality has greatly improved. In the past, people's greatest skill was carrying heavy loads, facing the earth and the sky, and farming was a hereditary occupation. Today, farmers are engaged in industry, commerce, and commodity economy, and peasants have become entrepreneurs. Our village has 10 people serving as managers, over 100 people as factory directors, 5 people have been named outstanding peasant entrepreneurs in Tianjin, 1 person has been named the best peasant entrepreneur in the country, and 1 person has been named an outstanding young factory director in the country. Learning economics, science, and technology has become the pursuit of many people.

Change Comes from Reform, Reform Brings Change

Visitors always ask, "Why has Daguozhuang undergone such tremendous changes in just 10 years?" My answer: Fundamentally, it is due to the set of policies and guidelines established by the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee. Change comes from reform, and reform brings change.

The greatest achievement of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee is to advocate for seeking truth from facts and emancipating the mind. Without this, there would be no Daguozhuang of today.

Before the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the first 30 years can be divided into three stages. The first stage was land reform and cooperativization, during which people's lives improved, and farmers sought wealth and prosperity. The second stage was marked by "blind commands" and "leapfrogging poverty," which was not successful and brought destruction to productive forces and disasters to the people. The third stage was the "Cultural Revolution," which brought calamity to the country and the people. For a full 10 years, production did not develop, living standards did not improve, and life became tighter day by day. Why? In the countryside, it was the emphasis on "class struggle as the key link" and "anti-wealth phobia" that caused the "anti-rich wind." At that time, wealth was associated with capitalism, and poverty was associated with socialism. Poverty was revolutionary, and wealth was to be overthrown. Poverty was glorious, and wealth was shameful. Poverty was something to be praised, and wealth was something to be attacked. "We would rather have socialist grass than capitalist sprouts," how absurd it was! At that time, in the countryside, the anti-rich campaign was conducted in three aspects. First, it criticized the "theory of productive forces," making people mistakenly believe that production was not in line with Marxism, turning truth into falsehood, and causing great confusion in people's minds. Second, it organizationally suppressed those who led in production. A large number of leading cadres who led in getting rich were criticized, punished, and removed from their posts. Third, in practice, it blocked the paths to wealth in the countryside. It emphasized "grain as the key link" and blocked all channels to money. Anything related to money was considered capitalism, and all legitimate sideline and industrial operations were seen as capitalist tails. Moreover, Jiang Qing advocated learning from Xiaojin Village, and in just three months, 1,200 laborers produced an 860-member performance troupe. Children danced, youth sang, women performed, and even old men and women took to the stage. Those who could perform on stage were given 10 points. Under such circumstances, who had the heart to engage in production? How could the rural economy not be severely damaged?

The Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee proposed shifting the party's work focus to economic construction, which liberated people's minds. An important point is recognizing that poverty is not socialism, and socialism is to make everyone live a wealthy and happy life. Building socialism requires first developing productive forces and getting rich through production. Only when production develops and material wealth increases can everyone live a comfortable and happy life. This conference pointed the way for us farmers to get rich, opened the door to getting rich, and brought hope for getting rich. The 10 years since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee have been the 10 years of Daguozhuang's reform and getting rich.

The First Reform: Developing Rural Industry

For a long period in the past, in the countryside, the emphasis was on "class struggle as the key link" and "grain as the key link." These two key links in the countryside were always causing trouble and making the countryside poor. Therefore, I said two things: "Class struggle as the key link makes people anxious," and "Grain as the key link makes people poor." These two key links, in a nutshell, meant that only single operations were allowed, and multiple operations were not permitted. To get rich, these two key links had to be changed. Therefore, I regarded the development of rural industry as the first reform in the past 10 years in Daguozhuang.

Facts have fully proven that without the development of rural industry, the countryside indeed cannot get rich. The comparison of industrial and agricultural output values in Daguozhuang from 1979 to 1987 can well illustrate this problem. The total output value for these 9 years was nearly 480 million yuan, of which industrial output value was 440 million yuan, accounting for 92.6%; agricultural output value was nearly 7 million yuan, accounting for 1.3%; commerce was over 9 million yuan, accounting for 2%; and other industries were over 19 million yuan, accounting for 4.1%. Imagine, if we only focused on agriculture, the average annual output value would only be 700,000 yuan. With this 700,000 yuan of agricultural output value, could the 3,000-plus elders, brothers, and sisters in Daguozhuang get rich?

The rapid development of Daguozhuang's rural industry, apart from starting early and having some special opportunities, generally speaking, mainly lies in the fact that it has relatively fully utilized the unique advantages of township and village enterprises over the old system's state-owned enterprises: first, genuine self-management; second, genuine self-responsibility for profits and losses; third, relatively good implementation of distribution according to labor and efficiency; fourth, market regulation and market competition. The rapid development of township enterprises cannot be generally attributed to relying on unorthodox practices to start. Township enterprises have a unique operating mechanism, management mechanism, and distribution mechanism, which is their advantage and the source of their vitality.

Currently, Daguozhuang's rural industry, like township enterprises across the country, is facing a new challenge and test. The Third Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee proposed to rectify the economic environment, rectify the economic order, and deepen enterprise reforms, which means that state-owned enterprises will further move towards the track of modern commodity economy, and the strength and advantages of state-owned enterprises will be further brought into play. Facing this new competitive situation, we must face up to the contradictions, analyze the problems, and come up with new strategies. Specifically for Daguozhuang, in the future, we must gradually achieve two strategic shifts: first, gradually develop export-oriented economy; second, gradually develop technology-intensive industries, especially relying on science and technology to increase production, improve quality, and achieve better results.

The Second Reform: Strengthening the Agricultural Foundation

Daguozhuang's focus on industry has attracted a lot of discussion and even risks, one of which is that Daguozhuang does not pay attention to agriculture. Changing "grain as the key link" to focus on industry, those who do not understand it are even more.

My view is that changing "grain as the key link" does not mean we do not pay attention to agriculture. Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy. Since 1984, the stagnation of agriculture and the recent shortage of some agricultural products have shown that agriculture, this foundation, can only be strengthened and must not be relaxed at any time. The development of rural industry and the development of agriculture do not contradict each other but rather promote each other. In fact, without the development of rural industry, agriculture would also be difficult to develop. Daguozhuang's development of rural industry has not only not affected the development of agriculture but has also led to a significant increase in agricultural production, including grain production. Both industry and agriculture have achieved common development.

On the basis of the development of rural industry, in the past 10 years, we have invested hundreds of millions of yuan in agriculture, building 5 medium and small irrigation stations, 4,700 meters of anti-seepage ditches, 2,000 meters of underground water pipes, 47 branch ditches, and 47 support ditches. In the event of a severe drought, the entire village's farmland can be irrigated in just 5 days. In recent years, the entire village has purchased 24 tractors, 5 combine harvesters, 2 corn harvesters, and 41 various matching machines. The mechanization rate of grain production and field operations has reached over 95%. 3,000 mu of wheat can be sown in 7 days and harvested in 4 days. 3,000 mu of corn can complete harvesting, threshing, and straw returning to the field in 15 days. Due to the realization of agricultural mechanization, the original 1,200 agricultural laborers have over 90% transferred to industry, commerce, and culture.

In the agricultural system, we have also carried out many reforms. Since Daguozhuang's rural industry started early and has formed a demand for the transfer of agricultural labor, coupled with a certain foundation in agricultural construction, we have not implemented the household contract responsibility system based on our specific situation but have taken the road of large-scale operations. However, in the management method, we still implement the "unified and contracted" method. The first step is to divide the 11 production teams into 25 work teams, with team leaders responsible for contract operation and management. The second step is to relatively concentrate the land, with several teams of skilled farmers responsible for contract operation and management. The third step, with the establishment and improvement of the agricultural machinery service system, field management is then contracted and managed by several dozen skilled farmers. Now, only 9 laborers are responsible for this aspect of work, and the entire agriculture is operated by the agricultural company.

Daguozhuang's agriculture, taking the road of intensive operations, has also developed significantly. Ten years ago, the total grain production was 1.2 million jin, but in 1988 it was 2.4 million jin. There are also 300 mu of fruit trees, over 100 mu of gardens, and 2,300 mu of fish and reed ponds. In the past two years, 1,400 mu of wasteland has been newly reclaimed, and the prospects for agriculture are very promising.

The Third Reform: Fully Utilizing Human Potential

The past backward and poor village has become a modern new countryside, and the past farmers have become entrepreneurs, reflecting the immense potential of people and the significant release of this potential. The tremendous changes in Daguozhuang are the result of this potential being unleashed; while the release of this potential is both an important content of reform and an active result of reform. Economic system reform, after all, is to straighten out various relationships and fully bring out people's initiative.

How can people's initiative be fully brought out?

In distribution, the big pot system must be broken, and efforts must be made to establish a distribution structure for socialist commodity economy. In the past, collective economy practiced the capped and guaranteed work point system, where more labor did not mean more income, and less labor did not mean less income. Who would have the labor initiative? Therefore, talking about reform means thoroughly changing the big pot system and truly implementing the principle of more labor, more income, and less labor, less income. I often mention two examples. One is Ma Deliang, who in 1983 contracted 137 mu of farmland, producing 49,000 jin of grain that year. According to the contract regulations, he should receive 15,500 yuan. Dare we fulfill it? We not only fulfilled it in full but also rewarded him an additional 1,000 yuan. Another is Yu Zuo'an, who contracted 18 mu of land, producing 1,580 jin of grain, and should receive 525 yuan, the lowest income in the village. Because the contract task was not completed, he was also fined 148 yuan. The income of the two people differs by nearly 30 times. This is truly a system of no upper limit and no lower guarantee, thoroughly smashing the big pot system of egalitarianism. Daguozhuang's distribution principle is "contract to labor, progressive reward." Different industries, different jobs, and different contract targets, but the basic wages are roughly the same. Who completes the contract target can receive the basic wage, and exceeding the target can receive a reward. The more the excess, the more the reward, and the more money one gets.

In the operating system, Daguozhuang's approach can be summarized in 16 characters: "unified operation, specialized contracting, contract to labor, progressive reward." More specifically, it is three characters: "unified, decentralized, linked." "Unified" refers to the general company's unified operation, with production materials owned by the company, and development plans, operating policies, and methods formulated by the general company. "Decentralized" means decentralization, with the general company decentralizing to sub-companies, sub-companies to general factories, and general factories to sub-factories, giving each level operating autonomy. "Linked" means linking benefits to individuals, making labor and remuneration consistent, and everyone can obtain labor income commensurate with their contributions. This set of systems makes everyone full of energy, especially the managers and factory directors, who all establish a firm concept of developing commodity economy and a continuous sense of competition. Competition is a treasure. Competition brings out talents, competition brings out technology, and competition brings out efficiency. Competing in the waves of commodity economy is like rowing against the current; one wants to relax but dares not. This is the driving force behind economic development and the reason why reform must be persisted with and has hope.

　　十年改革　十年巨变
    禹作敏
    六个大变化
    天津解放４０年了。在这４０年中，我们大邱庄的历史截然分成两段：前３０年和后１０年。前３０年寻富不能富，党的十一届三中全会召开以后这１０年，求富真致富，发生了意想不到的大变化。简单说来，有六个方面：
    第一，经济有了巨大发展。工农业总产值前３０年累计１２５０万元，而１９８７年达２亿元，１９８８年超过４亿元，比前３０年增加３０多倍。前３０年，年平均纳税１万元，１９８７年是９９７万元，１９８８年１０００多万元，增加１０００多倍。前３０年，纯收入总计７２３万元，１９８７年是４１４５万元，１９８８年约７５００万元，增加近１０倍。
    第二，工业形成了企业集团，农业形成了规模经营。现有４个工业公司，１５０多个工厂。三个公司产值上亿元，一个产值８０００万元。农业，４４００亩地，１９７８年产粮１２０万公斤，１９８８年产粮２４０万公斤，增加了一倍。
    第三，文教事业大发展。过去，我们村５０岁左右的人基本上没有文化。现在，３０岁左右的青年都受到了９年制义务教育，达到了初中以上的文化程度。全村投资２００多万元新建了幼儿园、中小学。
    第四，人民生活大提高。历史上从来没有解决的温饱问题，前几年就已彻底解决。现在普遍达到小康水平，吃穿住用花都很好，各户存款达千万元，原来的光棍都找到了对象，老年人生活都有社会保障。
    第五，穷村成了新城镇。过去村里街道高低不平，住的全是破土房。现在的住宅，有四合院的大瓦房，有高层单元式的楼房和小别墅，人均住房面积２６平方米。村里几十条大街小巷都是柏油路。
    第六，人的素质大提高。过去人们最大的本事是抬大筐，受大累，面朝黄土背朝天，种田是代代本行。而今种田人干工业，干商业，搞商品经济，庄稼汉成了企业家。我们村当经理的有１０人，当厂长的有１００多人，有５人被评为天津市的优秀农民企业家，有１人被评为全国最佳农民企业家，１人被评为全国优秀青年厂长。学经济、学科学、学技术成了很多人的追求。
    　　　　变化来自改革，改革才有变化
    来参观的人总是问：“大邱庄为什么会在１０年间发生这么大的变化？”我的回答：从根本上说，还是来自党的十一届三中全会确定的一整套方针、政策。变化来自改革，改革才有变化。
    十一届三中全会的一个最大的功绩，就是提出实事求是，思想解放。没有这一条，也没有大邱庄的今天。
    十一届三中全会以前３个１０年，第一阶段是土改和合作化，那个时候人们的生活有改善，农民求富奔富。第二个阶段搞“瞎指挥”、“穷过渡”就不行了，给生产力带来破坏，给群众带来灾难。第三个阶段是“文化大革命”，祸国殃民。整整１０年，生产得不到发展，生活得不到提高，日子一天比一天紧。为什么？在农村，就是搞“以阶级斗争为纲”，“恐资症”造成了“批富风”。那时候，把富和资本主义联系起来，把穷和社会主义联系起来。穷则革命，富要变修。穷则光荣，富则可耻。穷是歌颂的事物，富是打倒的对象。“宁要社会主义的草，不要资本主义的苗”，荒唐到了何等地步！那个时候，在农村批富，是从３个方面进行的。首先是批“唯生产力论”，使人们误认为搞生产不符合马克思主义，把真理说成谬误，在人们的思想上造成了极大的混乱。其次，从组织上打击那些发展生产的带头人。一大批带头致富的干部被批斗，受处分，被整下台。第三，从实践上堵住了农村致富的门路。片面强调“以粮为纲”，堵塞一切进钱的渠道，凡是和钱沾边的统统被当成资本主义，一切正当的工副业经营都被看成资本主义尾巴。不仅如此，江青还号召学小靳庄，３个月时间，１２００整半劳动力产生了８６０名演员队伍。儿童跳，青年唱，妇女演，老头老太太也登台耍。谁能上台演节目，就给谁记１０分。在这种情况下，谁还有心思搞生产呢？农村经济怎么能不大伤元气呢？
    十一届三中全会提出把党的工作重点转移到经济建设上来，这使人们的思想获得大解放。很重要的一条，就是认识到贫穷不是社会主义，社会主义就是要使大家过富裕幸福的生活。搞社会主义建设，首先要发展生产力，要通过生产致富。生产发展了，物质财富增加了，大家才能过舒坦的幸福生活。这次会议为我们农民指明了致富的方向，打开了致富的大门，带来了致富的希望。党的十一届三中全会以来的１０年，就是我们大邱庄改革致富的１０年。
    　　　　第一个改革：发展乡村工业
    过去一个长时期，在农村搞“以阶级斗争为纲”、“以粮为纲”，这两个纲在农村老是“穷折腾”，也把农村“折腾穷”。所以我说了两句话：“以阶级斗争为纲，抓得人心慌”；“以粮为纲，搞得穷当当”。这两个“纲”，归结到一点，就是只能搞单一经营，不许搞多种经营。要致富，就得改掉这两个“纲”。因此，我把发展乡村工业，看成是１０年来大邱庄的第一个改革。
    事实也已充分证明，没有乡村工业的发展，农村确实是富不起来的。我们大邱庄１９７９年到１９８７年这９年的工业和农业产值对比，就很能说明这个问题。这９年的总产值近４．８亿元，其中工业产值４．４亿元，占９２．６％；农业产值近７００万元，占１．３％；商业９００多万元，占２％；其它行业１９００多万元，占４．１％。试想，如果单一搞农业，每年平均产值只有７０万元，靠这７０万元农业产值，大邱庄３０００多父老兄弟姐妹能富起来吗！
    大邱庄的乡村工业发展这么快，除了搞得早和一些特殊机遇外，从一般的条件说，主要是比较充分地发挥乡镇工业比之旧体制下全民所有制工业的特殊优势：一是真正的自主经营，二是真正的自负盈亏，三是比较好地体现按劳动和效益分配，四是市场调节，市场竞争。乡镇企业发展神速，不能一概说成是靠不正之风起家的。乡镇企业有独特的经营机制、管理机制、分配机制，这是它的优势所在，是它具有生命力之所在。
    当前，我们大邱庄的乡村工业和全国乡镇企业一样，又面临着一次新的挑战和考验。党的十三届三中全会提出治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序、深化企业改革，这意味着城市企业将进一步走向现代化商品经济的轨道，国营企业的能量和优势将进一步发挥出来。面对这种新的竞争形势，我们要正视矛盾，分析问题，拿出新的招数。从大邱庄的具体情况说，今后要逐步实现两个战略性转移：一是逐步发展外向型经济，二是逐步发展技术密集型产业，特别是要依靠科学技术，使产量增加，质量提高，效益更好。
    　　　　第二个改革：切实加强农业基础
    大邱庄搞工业，招来了很多议论，甚至风险，其中一条，就是说大邱庄不重视农业。改掉“以粮为纲”，搞工业，不理解的人更多。
    我的看法，改掉“以粮为纲”，并不是说不要重视农业。农业是国民经济的基础，１９８４年以来的农业徘徊及近几年某些农产品的供应紧张，说明农业这个基础只能加强，任何时候都不能放松。发展乡村工业与发展农业二者不但不矛盾，而且是相互促进的。实际上，不发展乡村工业，农业也很难发展起来。大邱庄发展乡村工业，不但没有影响农业的发展，而且使农业，包括粮食生产有了显著的增长，工业和农业都得到共同发展。
    在乡村工业发展的基础上，１０年来，我们向农业投资几百万元，建成中小扬水站５座，防渗渠道４７００米，地下输水管道２０００米，支斗渠４７条，遇上大旱，全村耕地只要５天就可普浇一遍。这几年，全村购买拖拉机２４台，联合收割机５台，玉米收获机２台，各种配套机械４１台，粮食生产和场上作业机械化程度达到９５％以上。３０００亩小麦，７天可以全部播完，４天可以收完。３０００亩玉米，１５天可以完成收获、脱粒、秸秆还田的任务。由于实现了农业机械化，原来务农的１２００名劳动力，９０％以上已转移到工业、商业和文化方面。
    在农业体制上，我们也进行了许多改革。由于大邱庄乡村工业起步早，已形成对农业劳动力转移的需求，加上农业建设有一定基础，我们从自己的具体情况出发，没有实行包产到户，而是走规模经营的道路，但在管理方式上仍然实行“统包结合”的办法。第一步是把１１个生产队划分为２５个作业组，由组长承包经营和管理。第二步是把土地相对集中，由种田能手组成几个组承包经营和管理。第三步，随着农机服务系统的建立和完善，田间管理则由几十个种田能手承包经营和管理。现在只有９个劳动力负责这方面的工作，整个农业由农业公司经营。
    大邱庄的农业，走集约经营的道路，发展也是很大的。１０年前，粮食总产１２０万公斤，１９８８年２４０万公斤。另有果木树３００亩，园田１００多亩，鱼苇塘２３００亩。近两年，又新开荒地１４００亩，农业的前景是十分诱人的。
    　　　　第三个改革：充分发挥人的潜能
    过去落后的穷泊洼变成了现代的新农村，过去的庄稼人变成了企业家，反映出人有多么巨大的潜能，也反映出这种巨大潜能的较大发挥。大邱庄的巨大变化，是这种潜能迸发的结果；而这种潜能的发挥，既是改革的一项重要内容，又是改革的积极成果。经济体制改革，说到底，就是要理顺各方面的关系，使人的积极性充分发挥出来。
    怎样才能充分发挥人的积极性呢？
    在分配上要打破大锅饭，努力建立社会主义商品经济的分配结构。过去的集体经济，搞的是封顶又保底的工分制，多劳不能多得，少劳不能少得，谁还会有劳动积极性？所以，讲改革，就要彻底改掉大锅饭，真正实行谁多劳就多得，谁少劳就少得的原则，敢于拉开档次，奖勤罚懒。我经常讲的两个例子，一个是马德良，１９８３年承包１３７亩耕地，当年产粮４９０００公斤，按承包规定应得报酬１５５００元。敢不敢兑现？我们不但如数兑现，还另外奖励他１０００元。一个是禹作安，承包１８亩地，产粮１５８０公斤，应得款５２５元，在全村收入最低。因为没有完成承包任务，还罚了他１４８元。两个人的收入相差近３０倍。这是真正的上不封顶、下不保底，彻底打碎平均主义的大锅饭。大邱庄的分配原则，是“联产到劳，累进计奖”。行业不一样，工种不一样，承包指标不一样，但是基本工资都差不多。谁完成承包指标，谁就可以拿到基本工资，超额可以拿奖，超额越多，得奖越多，拿的钱也就越多。
    在经营体制上，大邱庄的一套办法，归结起来是１６个字，即“统一经营，专业承包，联产到劳，累进计奖”。再具体说，就是三个字，“统、放、联”。“统”是指由总公司统一经营，生产资料归公司所有，发展规划、经营方针和办法由总公司制定。“放”就是放权，总公司对分公司放权，分公司对总厂放权，总厂对分厂放权，使各级都有经营自主权。“联”即利益联到身，使人们的劳动和报酬相一致，人人都能得到与自己贡献相符合的劳动收入。这一套制度，使得个个生龙活虎，特别是经理、厂长们，人人都树立起牢固的发展商品经济的观念，不断进取的竞争意识。竞争是个宝。竞争出人才，竞争出技术，竞争出效益。在商品经济的风浪中竞争，好比逆水行舟，想松懈也不敢松懈。这就是经济发展的动力所在，也是改革之所以要坚持、改革之所以有希望之所在。
