Some modern art masters have found success by rediscovering primitive art and infusing qualities such as purity, simplicity, ruggedness, and vitality into modern artistic creation. No wonder some people compare this magical place, Guizhou, to Tahiti, which nurtured Gauguin. Guizhou's rich ethnic and folk art traditions, imbued with primitive charm, and the vibrant customs and people of various ethnic groups have also nurtured Chinese modern artists, with Liu Yong being one of them. This self-taught middle-aged Buyi artist, who calls himself a "Yelang person," does not boast or have a narrow vision. From the more than 100 pieces of his cartoons, ceramics, woodcarvings, and tapestries recently exhibited at the National Art Museum of China, we see the broad world in the eyes of this "Yelang person."

Liu Yong divides his creations into three periods: the "Cartoon Period," the "Ceramic Period," and the "Mixed-Blood Period."

A tumultuous life and hardships have forged Liu Yong's unyielding character and his tenacious pursuit of art. To express his hatred and love, he began drawing cartoons. During the Cultural Revolution, he created works like "The Upside-Down Era." In the autumn of 1976, he took his cartoons to the streets for an exhibition. Since then, his pent-up creative passion has flowed like a flood, and in just a few years, he created and published over 300 cartoons. His cartoons are ingenious in concept and composition, sharply criticizing social issues, and blending humor and satire with decorative appeal. Among them, "God·Human·Bird," which mocks the worship of religious idols, won the highest award, the "Chinese Cartoon Golden Monkey Award." "Safe?!" which depicts birds nesting in the mouth of a monster, warning people not to indulge in the comfort of danger, won the Excellent Award at the 10th Japan "Yomiuri International Cartoon Award."

Liu Yong, who is never satisfied with the status quo, turned to ceramics. The ceramic period was also a time when he extensively absorbed Guizhou's ethnic and folk art. While collecting, organizing, and studying folk art, he was deeply moved by the rugged, bold, and exquisite embroidery, batik, bronze drum patterns, and Nuo opera masks. He combined the decorative elements of folk art with the traditional shapes of bronze and ceramic vessels, creating a new type of ceramic with Guizhou characteristics. But he soon realized that these works, though innovative, had not escaped the constraints of practical household items. He fell into a state of hesitation and distress. It was the concept of "hybrid vigor" from biology that enlightened him. He thought of "crossbreeding" cartoons, sculptures, and ceramics to produce new varieties, which would have the symbolic meaning of cartoons and the characteristics of sculptures and ceramics.

The secret to an artist's success lies in recognizing oneself in creation. Liu Yong's life experiences, folk art cultivation, and starting from cartoons have naturally shaped his unique qualities: fearlessness, philosophical thinking, strong national form, symbolic meaning, and a sense of humor. His "crossbreeding" is to firmly grasp these qualities, continue, and elevate them. With more "crossbreeding" creations, his "Mixed-Blood Period" was formed. At this time, his sources of inspiration became broader, and advocating world peace and protecting the human survival environment became the theme of his creations. The woodcarving "Conception" places a fetus in the belly of a dove, symbolizing that peace nurtures life, and human survival and development need a peaceful environment. The ceramic sculpture "Trinity" combines humanity, the Earth, and peace into an indivisible whole. He also created works based on "The Classic of Mountains and Seas" and other ancient myths, giving them modern meanings. In the glazed ceramic "Liang Shanbo, Zhu Yingtai, and Ritual," he tried to visualize Lu Xun's famous saying, "Cannibalistic Ritual." The ceramic and woodcarving combination "The Frog Swallowing the Swan" warns people to be vigilant against the tragedy of evil prevailing. He also created many tapestries and sand ceramics with strong national art characteristics and rich life breath. In his art, he never imitates others or repeats himself. He pursues the diversity of themes, forms, and materials. He presents to people a rich and colorful artistic world.

Liu Yong's creative practice provides us with valuable experience in moving from ethnic and folk art to modern art. In the future, an even broader world will unfold before this "Yelang person."

　　“夜郎人”眼里的宽广世界    
    ——《刘雍美术作品展》观后
    廖开明
    从原始艺术里再发现，寻觅早已失去的纯真、质朴、粗犷、活力等特质溶入现代艺术创造中，这是有些现代艺术大师们成功的门径。难怪有人把贵州这个神奇的地方比喻为曾哺育出高更的塔希提岛。她那带着原始气息的丰厚的民族、民间艺术传统和各民族绚丽的风土人情，也哺育了中国的现代艺术家，刘雍就是其中之一。这位自学成才的布依族中年美术家，自称夜郎人，他却不妄自尊大、鼠目寸光。从他最近在中国美术馆所展示的百余件漫画、陶艺、木雕、挂毯等作品中，我们看到了这个“夜郎人”眼里的宽广世界。
    刘雍将自己创作分为：“漫画时期”、“陶器时期”和“混血时期”的三个阶段。
    坎坷的经历、饱尝的艰辛铸就了刘雍嫉恶如仇的刚毅性格，也磨砺了他追求艺术的执著个性。为表达憎和爱他画起了漫画，在十年动乱时，他创作了《颠倒的年代》等作品，１９７６年秋他把漫画拿到街头挂展。从那以后他郁结的创作激情如开闸的洪水一泄不止，几年间创作发表了３００多幅漫画。他的漫画构思构图奇妙，犀利针砭时弊，并寓幽默讽刺于装饰趣味中。其中嘲讽宗教偶像崇拜的《神·人·鸟》在中国漫画展上获最高奖“中国漫画金猴奖”。表现鸟儿在怪兽血盆大口里筑巢，告诫人们不要沉湎于危险中的安乐窝的《安全？！》获得第十届日本“读卖国际漫画大奖”优秀奖。
    不安于现状的刘雍又做起陶艺来。陶器时期也是他大量地吸吮贵州民族、民间艺术养料的时期。在搜集、整理、研究民间美术中，他被那些粗犷豪放精美无比的挑花、刺绣、蜡染、铜鼓图案、傩戏脸壳所深深折服。他把民间美术的装饰意味和传统的青铜器、陶器造型合为一体，创造出一种具有贵州地方特色的新陶器。但他很快就发现，这些作品虽有创新却没有摆脱实用生活器皿的束缚。他又陷入徘徊苦闷中。是生物学中的“杂种优势”使他茅塞顿开。他想到将漫画、雕塑、陶艺进行“杂交”产生新的品种，它具有漫画的寓意、雕塑和陶艺的特性。
    艺术家成功的诀窍莫过于在创造中认识了自己。刘雍的人生经历、民间艺术素养、从漫画起步，这些很自然地造就他特有的气质：无畏正气，哲理思考，强烈的民族形式，象征寓意手法并带有幽默感。他的“杂交”就是紧紧把握住这些，将它们延续、升华。有较多的“杂交”创造才构成了他的“混血时期”。此时他的取材更为宽广，争取世界和平保护人类的生存环境成为创造的主题。木雕《孕》将胎儿置于和平鸽腹中，象征着和平孕育生命，人类的生存和发展需要和平的环境。陶雕《三位一体》将人类、地球、和平融为不可分的一体。他还创作了以《山海经》和其它古代神话为题材的作品，给它们赋予现代的新意。在釉陶《梁山伯、祝英台与礼教》中，他力图把鲁迅的名言“吃人的礼教”形象化。釉陶木雕结合的《吞食天鹅的虾蟆》让人们警惕出现邪恶逞凶的悲剧。他还创作了大量具有强烈民族艺术特色和浓厚生活气息的挂毯、砂陶等作品。他艺术上从不因袭别人，也不重复自己。追求题材、形式、质材的多样化。他为人们奉献出丰富多姿的艺术世界。
    刘雍的创作实践为我们提供了从民族、民间走向现代的宝贵经验。未来，将在这个“夜郎人”面前展现出更为宽广的世界。
