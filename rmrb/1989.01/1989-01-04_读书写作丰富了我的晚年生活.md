Reading and Writing Enriched My Later Years

I felt a sense of loss and frustration after retiring, and I was very depressed, wondering if this was the end of my life. My heart felt empty, and I didn't know how to spend my later years.

One day, as I paced around the house feeling gloomy, I suddenly noticed a pile of old books. I picked one up and started flipping through it, only to find that there were many words I didn't recognize. I thought, since I've retired and have nothing to do, why not calm down and learn some more culture and read some books?

The next day, I found "Three Character Classic," "Hundred Family Surnames," and a few other books to start reading. Just then, a friend came to visit. They picked up the books I was reading, laughed, and said, "Don't make a fool of yourself, old friend. After thirty, it's too late to learn a new skill, let alone us old folks in our sixties and seventies." But I was determined to read and learn. To avoid being disturbed by visitors, I declined all invitations.

Two years passed, and I read dozens of books, significantly improving my cultural knowledge. For a period, I studied the "Along the River During the Qingming Festival" by the Northern Song Dynasty painter Zhang Zeduan and spent a few months writing a story about it. I submitted it to 37 newspapers and magazines, but all were returned. Finally, with a glimmer of hope, I sent the manuscript to the Sichuan "Historical Knowledge" magazine. To my surprise, it was published. Friends came to congratulate me, and I was so moved that I shed tears of joy. From then on, I studied even harder.

Seven years have passed, and I have become an amateur writer. Currently, more than 200 of my articles, totaling over 100,000 words, have been published in over 100 newspapers, magazines, and radio stations, including the "People's Daily" and "China Senior Citizen's Newspaper." The "China Senior Citizen's Newspaper" and "Liaoning Senior Friends Magazine" not only published my articles but also appointed me as a special correspondent. The "Local Chronicles" of Luoshan County, Henan, and the Information Center of Shenqiu County have both appointed me as a consultant. The Kaifeng City News Correspondents Association has accepted me as a member, and the Kaifeng City Writers Association has also accepted me as a member. I attended the Henan Province Retired Cadres Representatives Conference and was awarded the "Kaifeng City Outstanding Contribution Award for the Elderly." Now, Kaifeng No. 2 Middle School, No. 8 Middle School, No. 14 Middle School, and Hui Ethnic Middle School have appointed me as a consultant and an off-campus tutor. I feel that my later years are very fulfilling.

　　读书写作丰富了我的晚年生活
    我离休后有一种失落感难以排遣，非常苦闷，暗想今生难道就此了结吗？我的心里空空的，不知晚年该如何度过。
    一天，我正闷闷不乐地在屋里踱步，突然发现一堆旧书。我随手拿起翻看，书中竟有好多字不认识。我想，既然离休了，无事可干，干脆静下心来，重新学点文化，读点书吧！
    第二天，我就找出三字经、百家姓等几本读物，开始读了起来。这时，刚好有朋友来找我，他们拿起我正读看的几本书，边笑边说：“老兄别出洋相了，人过３０不学艺，何况咱们这些已六七十岁的老头呢？”但我下定决心读书学习。为了避免客人打扰，我便谢绝会客。
    两年过去了，我读了几十本书，文化知识大有长进。有一段时间，我研究了北宋名画家张择端的《清明上河图》，用几个月时间，写了一篇《清明上河图》的故事，陆续投给３７家报刊，但均被退回。最后抱着一线希望，我把此稿投往四川《历史知识》杂志，不久竟发表了。亲友们来祝贺，我激动地流下了眼泪。从此我自学更有劲了。
    ７年过去了，我成了一个业余作者。目前，光明日报、中国老年报等１００多家报刊、电台发表了我写的文章２００多篇，１０多万字。中国老年报、辽宁老同志之友杂志，不仅发表过我写的文章，还聘请我为特约通讯员。河南光山县《地方志》、沈丘县信息中心都聘请我为顾问。开封市新闻通讯员协会吸收我为会员，开封市文学工作者协会也吸收我为会员。我出席了河南省离休干部代表大会，荣获了开封市老有所为精英奖。现在，开封二中、八中、十四中、回民中学等学校，聘请我当顾问和校外辅导员。我感到，我的晚年生活非常充实。
