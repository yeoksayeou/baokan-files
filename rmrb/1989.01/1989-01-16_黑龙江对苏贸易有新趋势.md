    Heilongjiang's border trade with the Soviet Union has shifted from barter to economic and technical trade, with a total contract value of 650 million Swiss francs and a total cargo value of 150 million Swiss francs, more than tripling the figures from the previous year.

    Currently, over 1,200 people from Heilongjiang province are engaged in activities such as vegetable cultivation, construction, forestry, and railway building in the Soviet Far East. With the acceleration of the Binxi-Suihua railway line reconstruction project, the cargo volume passing through Suifenhe railway has seen new growth. Efforts are also being made to open road transportation. Heihe and Songjiang cities are actively developing water transportation while also preparing to open winter ice road transportation. Mishan, Dongning, Xunke, and Sunwu are in the process of establishing four temporary cargo points.

　　黑龙江对苏贸易有新趋势
    据新华社电  去年黑龙江对苏边境贸易由易货向经贸、技贸发展，签订合同总额６．５亿瑞士法郎，过货总额１．５亿瑞士法郎，比上年增长３倍多。
    目前，黑龙江全省有１２００多人在苏联远东地区从事蔬菜种植、建筑施工、森林采伐、铁路建设等。随着滨绥复线改造工程的加快，绥芬河市铁路的过货量又有新的增长，并在积极筹备开通公路运输。黑河、同江市在发展水运的同时，积极开通冬季冰上汽车运输。密山、东宁、逊克、孙吴正在开辟４个临时过货点。
