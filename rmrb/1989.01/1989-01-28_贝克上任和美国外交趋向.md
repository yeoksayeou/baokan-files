After the U.S. Senate officially approved James Baker on January 25, he has taken office as the Secretary of State for the new Bush administration, shouldering the responsibility for U.S. diplomacy. Baker is a well-known figure in American politics. Although he has never been in charge of diplomatic affairs, he has been in politics for many years, serving as the White House Chief of Staff and Secretary of the Treasury during Reagan's presidency. He is also very familiar with international economic issues and has offered unique insights on stabilizing the dollar and solving the world debt problem. Local observers believe that by choosing this close friend as Secretary of State, President Bush will have a capable assistant in handling major diplomatic issues in the future.

Since Bush was elected president in November last year until he took the oath of office on January 20 this year, Bush and his chosen diplomatic team have been busy conducting a comprehensive assessment of foreign policy, speaking cautiously. Although the blueprint for the new U.S. government's foreign policy is not yet very specific, from Baker's remarks at the Senate hearing and reports in the U.S. media, the general direction of U.S. diplomacy has begun to take shape.

Firstly, on diplomatic issues, the new government particularly emphasizes maintaining a good relationship with Congress, proposing that in the field of foreign policy, the principle of "bipartisan politics" should be followed. Due to frequent disputes between the government and Congress over foreign policy in past years, Baker repeatedly called on Congress to work with the government to solve the arduous tasks on the diplomatic agenda. He stressed that "bipartisan politics" is a "historical conclusion" and also a "recent experience conclusion." Secondly, when the new government conducted a comprehensive review of U.S. diplomacy, it emphasized adopting a realistic attitude towards the world and stressed the importance of "getting things done." It seems that these are two new principles of the Bush administration.

On the diplomatic agenda, the new government places the handling of relations with allied and neighboring countries at the top of the list. The U.S. government believes that the United States is both an Atlantic nation and a Pacific nation. In addition to improving relations with North American countries such as Canada and Mexico, it also needs to expand relations with Western allies and Pacific countries, emphasizing the need to fully understand the changes taking place in these countries and adapt to the changing environment.

U.S.-Soviet relations still occupy a very important position in U.S. diplomacy. However, in this regard, the U.S. faces a multitude of diplomatic issues. In general, the new government will adopt a cautious attitude when continuing to improve relations with the Soviet Union. The U.S. government believes that the Soviet Union has undergone real changes in recent years, providing reasons for hope, but at the same time believes that the Soviet Union remains a militarily powerful superpower, threatening the interests of the United States and its allies. Therefore, the guiding ideology of the U.S. policy towards the Soviet Union is to welcome Soviet reforms and changes, acknowledge that its policies have a realistic component, and at the same time emphasize that the United States must be far-sighted, cautious, and practical in dealing with the Soviet Union.

Currently, U.S.-Soviet relations include several aspects such as arms control, human rights, regional conflicts, and bilateral relations. The new government is still prepared to discuss these aspects with the Soviet Union, but emphasizes that in the area of human rights, the standards of the Helsinki Accords cannot be lowered, and in resolving regional conflicts, actual progress is required. In addition, the United States has proposed a new aspect, that is, to include some global issues such as terrorism, drugs, and environmental problems in the agenda of U.S.-Soviet relations.

In recent periods, the Soviet Union has taken unilateral initiatives in arms reduction and, at the time of Bush's inauguration, again expressed its desire to maintain stable relations with the United States. This is undoubtedly an external pressure on the United States, but the United States has so far only responded in principle. Not long ago, President Bush had a telephone conversation with Soviet leader Gorbachev, expressing his willingness to continue to expand cooperation with the Soviet Union and deepen mutual understanding. According to reports in U.S. newspapers, in U.S.-Soviet relations, especially in arms control negotiations, the United States will reassess and formulate its negotiating position. Therefore, the new government may not immediately propose specific suggestions on arms control.

Solving regional issues is also an urgent task facing the new government. Especially on the Central American issue, the U.S. government admits that in the past 10 years, its policy has not been successful and sometimes even contradictory. The U.S. government acknowledges that the peace plan proposed by President Arias in 1987 is a manifesto for seeking peace, but believes that this plan lacks a mechanism for implementation. Therefore, Baker called on Congress to adopt a bipartisan approach to handle the Central American issue. On the Middle East issue, the current government is no different from its predecessor. Although it will continue to engage in dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization, its support for Israel remains unchanged, and it firmly opposes the establishment of a Palestinian state, insisting that only direct negotiations among the parties concerned can lead to peace, etc. From this aspect, no new ideas have been seen.

The new U.S. government is taking office at a time when the international situation is easing and there is no imminent domestic or international crisis. It seems that the new government is not in a hurry to come up with a complete set of diplomatic strategies during its term. It should be said that during Reagan's second term, facing the changes and challenges of the world, adjustments have already been made to U.S. diplomacy. From this point of view, the foreign policy of the Bush administration will inevitably have a high degree of continuity. But this continuity also seems unlikely to remain unchanged. Bush's government will certainly have its own characteristics. Now people are paying attention to what changes will be made to U.S. diplomacy in the future and what impact these changes will have. Both President Bush and Secretary of State Baker emphasize realism. Now we need to see how this realism differs from the realism of the Reagan era in specific policies.

　　贝克上任和美国外交趋向
    本报记者  张启昕
    经美国参议院１月２５日正式批准，詹姆斯·贝克已经出任布什新政府的国务卿，肩负起美国外交的重任。贝克是美国政界的知名人士，虽然未曾主持过外交事务，但他从政多年，在里根总统时代担任过白宫办公厅主任、财政部长，而且对国际经济问题十分熟悉，曾对稳定美元、解决世界债务问题提出过独到见解。此间人士认为，布什总统选择这位挚友担任国务卿，在今后处理重大的外交课题时，有了得力的助手。
    自从去年１１月布什当选总统到今年１月２０日宣誓就职的两个多月里，布什及其选定的外交班子一直在忙于全面估价外交政策，言谈比较谨慎。虽然美国新政府的外交蓝图尚不十分具体，但从贝克在参院听证会上的言论以及美国报界的报道来看，美国外交的趋向大致已有轮廓。
    首先是在外交问题上，新政府特别强调同国会处理好关系，提出今后在外交政策领域要遵循“两党政治”的原则。由于在以往年代里，政府和国会之间经常发生外交政策的争执，贝克在参院听证会上则一再呼吁国会同政府一起来解决外交日程上的艰巨任务。他强调，“两党政治”是“历史的结论”，也是“近年来经验的结论”。其次是，新政府在对美国外交作一次全面的回顾时，强调要对世界采取现实主义的态度，强调要“把事情办成”的重要性。看来，这是布什政府标新立异的两条原则。
    在外交日程上，新政府把处理好同盟国和邻国的关系放在首位。美国官方认为，美国是大西洋国家，同时是太平洋国家，除了要对加拿大和墨西哥等美洲国家搞好关系外，还要扩大同西方盟国和太平洋国家的关系，强调要充分理解这些国家正在发生的变化，并适应变化中的环境。
    美苏关系仍在美国外交中占据十分重要的位置。但在这方面，美国面对的外交课题繁多，总的来说，新政府在继续改善同苏联的关系时将采取谨慎态度。美国官方认为，苏联近几年来发生了真正的变化，有理由充满希望，但同时认为，苏联仍是一个军事上强大的超级大国，威胁美国及其盟国的利益，因此美国对苏政策的指导思想是，既欢迎苏联的改革和变化，承认它的政策有了现实主义的成分，又强调美国对苏联必须深谋远虑，谨慎从事，讲究现实。
    当前美苏关系包括军备控制、人权、地区冲突和双边关系等几个方面的内容，新政府仍准备就这些方面同苏联进行讨论，但强调在人权方面，不能降低赫尔辛基协议的标准，在解决地区冲突方面要求有实际的进展。此外，美国还提出一个新的方面，即要求把全球性的一些问题，如恐怖主义、毒品和环境问题等列入美苏关系的议题。
    最近一个时期，苏联接连在裁军方面采取了单方面的主动行动，并在布什就任总统之际再次表示要同美国继续保持稳定的关系，这对美国无疑是种外来的压力，但美国迄今只作出原则性的反应。不久前，布什总统曾同苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫通了电话，表示愿意继续同苏联扩大合作，加深互相了解。而据美国报纸报道，在美苏关系上，特别在军备控制谈判上，美国将重新进行估量，拟定谈判立场，因此新政府似还不会马上对军备控制提出具体建议。
    解决地区问题也是新政府面临的紧迫任务。特别在中美洲问题上，美国官方承认，在过去１０年中，美国的政策并不成功，有时甚至是互相矛盾的。美国政府承认１９８７年阿里亚斯总统提出的和平计划是一个争取和平的纲领，但又认为这一计划缺乏贯彻执行的机制，因而贝克呼吁国会采取两党一致的方法来处理中美洲问题。在中东问题上，现任政府与其前任并无不同，虽然它将继续同巴勒斯坦解放组织进行对话，但对以色列的支持未变，而且坚持反对建立巴勒斯坦国，坚持只有有关各方直接谈判才能导致和平，等等，从这方面，人们并未看到新意。
    美国新政府是在国际形势趋向缓和、“不存在迫在眉睫的国内国际危机”的时刻执政的。看来新政府并不急于在执政之时就拿出一整套外交对策。应该说，在里根总统第二任期内，面对世界的变动和挑战，已经对美国外交作出调整，从这点来说，布什任期的外交政策势必具有很大的连续性。但这种连续性似也不可能一成不变，布什政府必然会有自己的特色。现在人们注意的是，经过重新审议之后，美国的外交在今后时期会有什么变动以及这些变动将会产生的影响。布什总统和贝克国务卿都强调现实主义，现在要看这种现实主义与里根时期的现实主义在具体政策上有何相同和不同之处。　　　　（本报华盛顿１月２６日电）
