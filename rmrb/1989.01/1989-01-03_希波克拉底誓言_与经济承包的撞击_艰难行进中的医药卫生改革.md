Reform has swept health institutions into the wave of contracting operations, and today's hospitals are vastly different from before. This has sparked strong reactions in society, with both praise and criticism.

Hospitals Come Alive

After contracting, the principles of more work, more income, and more rewards have motivated hospital staff, significantly improving work efficiency and increasing service volumes, thereby alleviating difficulties in seeing a doctor and getting hospitalized. Many hospitals no longer have long queues for registration, and some hospitals and departments even compete for patients at branch clinics. Medical staff strive for more repeat customers, improving service quality and attitudes. Departments using large and medium-sized medical equipment have seen improved inspection efficiency after adopting piecework contracting. Some projects that previously required a wait of one to two months now only take a week or a few days.

Contracting has also motivated medical staff to participate in economic management, transforming the previous wasteful use of drugs and materials into careful planning, reducing consumption and waste.

Contracting has given hospitals autonomy in operation and distribution, allowing them to purchase large and relatively advanced equipment with development funds and potentially extract bonus funds to improve the low incomes of medical staff. A hospital in Shenyang earned 5.7 million yuan in development funds from over-fulfillment bonuses in the first half of last year, more than double the health funds allocated by the state. Beijing Friendship Hospital received only 200 million yuan in state funds in 1987, which was not enough to cover staff salaries. Relying on self-operation, they spent 270 million yuan in total for the entire year.

The Introduction of Money

Dan Dong City's Garden Health Center and Eighth District Health Center were exposed by a radio station for giving patients medicine along with milk powder, MSG, pressure cookers, bed sheets, and blankets. This is indeed outrageous. It is understood that such incidents are not rare.

To attract patients, some hospitals give patients 100 yuan in internal canteen meal tickets upon admission, which can be redeemed for cash upon discharge. Private hospitals offer kickbacks to state-owned hospital doctors for referring patients, and the rates are rising. Some doctors earn 800 to 900 yuan in kickbacks per month just by issuing transfer letters for patients.

There are also other examples: A doctor at a large hospital transferred a patient with liver abscess to a private "joint venture" that offered high kickbacks. The "joint venture," which had no "diamond drill," struggled and eventually sent the patient back to the original hospital. By then, the patient was beyond saving. In a malaria-endemic area, a clinical doctor said that diagnosing malaria is not difficult. However, to keep patients longer, he initially treated it as a common cold. After a delay, he prescribed a small dose of anti-malarial medication, preventing quick recovery.

The general public reflects: In the past, a simple cold could be treated for a few jiao, but now it costs several to tens of yuan. In some hospitals, nurses charge 5 jiao for turning a patient, 3 jiao for emptying a bedpan, and 20 yuan for writing medical records. This "itemized charging" and understandable price increases have doubled the impact on rising medical costs.

A Call for Noble Medical Ethics

Although the aforementioned phenomena have not become the mainstream in the medical community, social opinions are becoming increasingly vocal. The strongest reactions come from within the medical community, with doctors calling for a revival of medical ethics.

Vice President of Beijing Union Medical College Hospital, Ai Gangyang, said: "The biggest impact of economic contracting on us is that it allows doctors to consider personal economic income when treating patients. This has never been openly advocated in ancient or modern times, East or West. Some say, doctors are also human, they also need to eat, why can't they do this? This is to lower the image of doctors too much. Doctors are a special profession, always dedicated to saving lives, with the patient's interests above personal gains. They cannot use their skills to improve themselves, just as soldiers cannot rely on their weapons and judges cannot achieve self-improvement through cases."

In 400 BC, the famous Greek physician Hippocrates would repeat his oath before treating patients: "I will apply dietetic measures for the benefit of the sick according to my ability and judgment; I will keep them from harm and injustice. I will neither give a deadly drug to anyone if asked for it, nor will I make a suggestion to this effect... I will not cut persons laboring under the stone, but will leave this to men who are engaged in this work. Whatever houses I may visit, I will come for the benefit of the sick, remaining free of all intentional injustice, of all mischief and in particular of sexual relations with both female and male persons, be they free or slaves." For over 2,000 years, the "Hippocratic Oath" has been the foundation of Western medical ethics. Sun Simiao, a renowned physician from the Sui and Tang dynasties, is the founder of traditional Eastern medical ethics. He stipulated that doctors should treat patients "without desire or greed, first showing great compassion and pity, vowing to save all living beings from suffering." The World Medical Association's 1948 "Physician's Declaration" states: "I will maintain the utmost respect for human life from the time of conception; even under threat, I will not use my medical knowledge contrary to the laws of humanity. I will not permit considerations of age, disease or disability, creed, ethnic origin, gender, nationality, political affiliation, race, sexual orientation, social standing or any other factor to intervene between my duty and my patient. I will respect the autonomy and dignity of my patient. I will respect the secrets that are confided in me, even after the patient has died. I will maintain the utmost respect for human life from the time of conception; even under threat, I will not use my medical knowledge contrary to the laws of humanity. I will not permit considerations of age, disease or disability, creed, ethnic origin, gender, nationality, political affiliation, race, sexual orientation, social standing or any other factor to intervene between my duty and my patient. I will respect the autonomy and dignity of my patient. I will respect the secrets that are confided in me, even after the patient has died." On December 15, 1988, the Ministry of Health of China issued the "Code of Medical Ethics for Medical Personnel and Implementation Measures." This is the contemporary Chinese physician's "Hippocratic Oath."

Many senior medical workers emphasize that the quality of medical ethics is more important than the quality of medical skills because it relates to the safety of human life. In addition to doctors maintaining self-respect and adhering to medical ethics, all sectors of society have the responsibility to uphold the noble medical ethics of doctors and create a good image for them.

The Gains and Losses of the Country and the People

Before the price of pharmaceuticals was liberalized more than 20 years ago, the state produced and operated pharmaceuticals mainly based on domestic medical needs, with many special concessions in taxes, loans, and purchase prices. After the price liberalization, various concessions were canceled, and the tax burden gradually increased, transforming pharmaceuticals from special commodities serving medicine into general commodities mainly for increasing economic income. The main indicator for evaluating the quality of pharmaceutical production and operation also shifted from social benefits to economic benefits.

Member of the Health Department's Health Reform and Development Research Group, Wei Fuka, said: "This has created an internal contradiction in China's medical and health industry that cannot be resolved. Originally, medical services with significant social welfare characteristics had to be realized through pharmaceuticals that could increase economic income. High drug prices have diluted the welfare nature of medical services. How can the public not complain?"

Last spring, during the hepatitis A outbreak in Shanghai, in China's largest An County drug market, the price of licorice root soared from a few jiao per pack to tens of yuan per pack, and a private merchant made a profit of over 400,000 yuan in one night; in May and June, the supply of Eucommia ulmoides was tight, and a few private merchants colluded to monopolize the supply of Eucommia ulmoides; the state-owned pharmaceutical company in An County, due to layer-by-layer contracting, had some employees colluding with private merchants to speculate. State-owned pharmaceutical enterprises gradually lost their regulatory role in the market. The drastic fluctuations in prices directly impacted the planting and processing of pharmaceuticals. The planting area of An County pharmaceuticals fluctuated between 130,000 to 140,000 mu and less than 10,000 mu, making it impossible to mass-produce patent medicines.

In 1987, the state directly earned 40 billion yuan in taxes from the production and operation of traditional Chinese and Western medicines, significantly more than before the price liberalization. However, the total pharmaceutical expenditure of state-owned and collective units and various administrative departments increased from 30 billion yuan in 1980 to 85 billion yuan. It is also necessary to see that the increased medical expenditure of 800 million farmers and urban and rural non-public medical personnel is far greater than the increased amount of state pharmaceutical expenditure. The increased expenditure of the country and the people has a considerable portion flowing into the pockets of speculators.

Debates on Hospital Contracting Operations

Overall, the current situation of medical services in China is still one of supply not meeting demand. Under the conditions of low levels of personnel, funds, and beds, economic contracting has strengthened the internal management mechanism, significantly improving the management level and intensity of hospitals. Director of the Beijing Hospital Management Research Institute, Huang Huijing, said: "Frontline management personnel, such as hospital directors and health bureau directors, have an easier time working than before. The strengthening of the responsibility system for positions has driven the optimization of labor combinations, fully utilizing the resources and efficiency of hospitals, alleviating the pressure of national medical funds. Increasing economic income through methods such as selling more drugs is a helpless measure."

Professor Sun Guangde of Renmin University of China believes: The soul of contracting is profit stimulation. Medical units under profit stimulation will inevitably tend to artificially increase supply and create demand. In the general commodity and service exchange, demand is determined by consumers. However, in medical services, doctors hold the diagnostic and treatment power, deciding what examinations to do and what drugs to take, which consumers cannot decide. Doctors are in a "leading" and "monopolistic" position. This allows medical units to provide "excessive services" according to the doctor's wishes rather than the patient's actual needs. Medical services are currently in a severely short-supply sector, and consumers cannot choose their services. When sick, they have no choice but to come. Now, some benefits brought by hospitals may be waste for society.

Researchers Dong Fuzhen from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences' Economic Research Institute, He Jianzhang from the Sociological Research Institute, and Huang Fanchang from the State Planning Commission's Economic Research Center pointed out: In welfare economics, hospitals are negative-benefit institutions, meaning that the economic benefits and social welfare goals of hospitals are contradictory. Regardless of the number of patients, hospital staff salaries, equipment depreciation and renewal, water and electricity consumption, and drug supplies must be paid. The only legitimate income for hospitals can only be the pure diagnosis and treatment fees paid by patients. Under the premise of determining the charging standards, the economic benefits of hospitals are positively correlated with the number of patients seen. From an economic perspective, the more patients, the higher the benefits. From a social benefit perspective, the fewer patients seen, the better the national health condition, and the greater the social welfare reflected. If hospitals artificially create patients to increase income, it is a crime against society. Due to this special nature, hospitals should not advocate economic contracting. In fact, the constraint mechanism of contracting on hospitals is also "soft," such as quality indicators and medical ethics, which are difficult to control. Therefore, contracting for medical units is only a short-term behavior and is not suitable for expanding the trial range.

The view of Ding Ningning from the Central Party School is that implementing economic accounting and strict budget management does not mean financial layer-by-layer contracting. Layer-by-layer contracting, self-managed bonuses, in essence, is that hospitals and various departments solve the problem of low salaries for medical staff by themselves, letting medical staff directly "create" economic benefits from patients. This is a practice that violates the professional ethics of medical staff. The status of doctors and patients is unequal, and in the face of pain and death, patients do not have the ability to bargain with medical staff. Medical work is noble and onerous, relating to the health and future of the entire nation. The salaries of medical staff should be sufficient to maintain their professional dignity, which is the responsibility of the state and should not be left for them to seek solutions.

Minister of Health Chen Minzhang stated: We are working hard to address medical ethics issues, which cannot be relaxed under any circumstances or conditions. For medical and health work, we have had a period of experience—once controlled, it dies; once released, it becomes chaotic. This shows that there are many problems that need to be reformed. The reform of the health system was rushed, and the measures and methods are either fundamentally unworkable or incomplete and imperfect. This needs to be verified in practice. Measures that do not gain the recognition of the broad masses will not be arbitrarily implemented. The problems left by history have already pressed us to the point of breathlessness, and we cannot create new problems for future generations. We sincerely hope that the whole society will work together to improve the reform of the health system.

　　“希波克拉底誓言”与经济承包的撞击
    ——艰难行进中的医药卫生改革
    本报记者  艾笑
    改革，使卫生事业单位也卷进承包经营大潮，如今的医院大不同前。对此，社会反响强烈，褒贬不一。
    医院活了
    承包后，多劳、多收、多得，从利害关系上调动了医院职工的积极性，表现为大大提高了劳动效率，服务量明显增加，缓解了看病难、住院难问题。不少医院已不见挂号的“长蛇阵”，有的医院和科室甚至出现医生到分号处争病人的情况。医务人员为争得更多“回头客”，服务质量高了，态度也好了。使用大中型医疗设备的科室计件承包后，检查效率大都有提高，有的项目过去需等一两个月，现在只需一周或一两天。
    承包调动了医务人员参与经济管理的积极性，药品、材料由过去的大手大脚变成精打细算，降低了消耗，减少了浪费。
    承包使医院有了经营和分配的自主权，能够使用发展基金自行购置大型和比较先进的设备，并有可能提取奖励基金，改善医务人员过低的收入。沈阳一家医院，去年上半年超收提成的发展基金就达５７万元，相当于国家拨给的卫生事业费一倍多。北京友谊医院１９８７年国家拨给的经费只２００万元，光职工工资开支都不够。依靠自身运营，他们当年全年总支出达２７００万元。
    金钱的介入
    丹东市花园卫生院和八道卫生院给病人开药时搭配奶粉、味素、高压锅、被套、毯子等生活用品，被广播电台揭露。这确实是胡来。据了解，这类事并不罕见。
    为招徕病人，有的医院在病人住进医院时就先发给内部食堂饭票１００元，出院时可兑换成现金归病人所有。民办医院对国营医院医生介绍来的病人，回扣的价码正在看涨。有的医生靠开病人转院单，每月可获取八九百元回扣。
    还有一些实例：一家大医院的医生把一位患肝脓肿的病人转给了一家能给高额回扣的民办“联合体”。本无“金刚钻”的“联合体”，几经折腾后又把病人送回这家医院。这时，病人已难以挽救。在一个疟疾流行区，一位临床医生表示，确诊疟疾是不困难的。但是，为了多留病人，他开始总是先当感冒治。拖过一段时间后，才给小剂量抗疟药物，使其不能很快医好。
    一般群众反映：过去得个感冒什么的，花几角钱就能看好，现在非得花几元十几元不可。在有的医院住院，护士帮着翻个身，５角；端一次便盆，３角；书写病历费，２元。这种“分解收费”和可以理解的物价上涨，给医疗费用的上涨造成了双重影响。
    呼唤崇高医德
    尽管上述现象并没有在医务界形成主流，但社会舆论反应日益强烈。其中，最强烈的恰恰来自医务界内部，医生们呼唤重振医德医风。
    北京协和医院副院长艾钢阳说：“经济承包对我们最大的冲击是允许医生在给病人诊治时考虑个人经济收入。这是古今中外都没人公开宣扬过的。有人说，医生也是人，他也要吃饭，为什么不能这么干呢？这未免把医生的形象降得太低了。医生是一种特殊职业，历来都是济世救人，病家利益高于个人。他不能以自己的技术作为改善自我的手段，这正像军人不能依靠手里的武器、法官不能通过办案来达到自我改善的目的一样。”
    公元前４００年，希腊名医希波克拉底每每给人看病之前，都要重复自己的誓言：“我愿尽我力之所能与判断力所及，无论至于何处，遇男遇女，贵人及奴婢，我之唯一目的，为病家谋幸福……”２０００多年来，“希波克拉底誓言”一直是西方医德的基础。我国隋唐名医孙思邈则是东方传统医德的奠基人，他规定医生治病，“无欲无求，先发大慈恻隐之心，誓愿普救生灵之苦。”世界医学会１９４８年制定的《医师宣言》是“我在行医中一定要保持端庄和良心。我一定把病人的健康和生命放在一切首位。我一定要保持医生职业的荣誉和高尚的传统。”１９８８年１２月１５日，我国卫生部颁布了《医务人员医德规范及实施办法》。这是当代中国医生的“希波克拉底誓言”。
    许多高年资的医务工作者都强调，医德的好坏高低，比医术的好坏高低更为重要，因为它关系人的生命安危。除医生自尊自爱、信守医德之外，社会各界都有责任维护医生崇高的医德，为医生树立美好的形象。
    国与民的得失
    药品市场价格放开之前的２０多年，国家生产经营药材，主要是根据国内医疗需要进行安排，在税收、贷款、收售价格等许多方面都有特殊优惠。价格放开之后，各项优惠取消并逐步加大了利税任务，药品就由为医疗服务的特殊商品，变成主要为增加经济收入的一般商品。衡量药品生产经营好坏的主要标志，也由看其社会效益变成看其经济效益。
    卫生部卫生事业改革与发展研究组成员魏福凯说：“这样，就在我国的医药卫生事业内部产生了一个自身无法解决的矛盾。本来具有很大社会福利性的医疗服务，要通过能增加经济收入的药品去实现。高昂的药价，把医疗的福利性质冲淡了。群众怎能不怨声载道？”
    去年春天上海甲肝流行时，在我国最大的安国药市，板兰根由几角钱一包猛涨到十几元一包，一个存有板兰根的私商一夜之间得暴利４万多元；五六月份牛膝缺货，几个私商勾结，全部垄断了牛膝货源；安国国营药材公司由于层层承包，有的职工就与私商结合倒买倒卖。国营药材企业逐渐丧失了对市场的调节作用。价格的大起大落，直接冲击着药材的种植和加工。安国药材的种植面积，忽而十三四万亩，忽而不足一万亩，成药的生产无法大量进行。
    １９８７年，国家从中西药品的生产经营中直接得利税４０多亿元，确实比价格放开前大大增加。但是，国营、集体事业单位和各级行政部门的医药费总支出，却从１９８０年的３０多亿元猛增到８５亿元。还要看到，８亿农民和城乡非公费医疗者增加的医疗支出，要远远大于国家医药费增加的数目。国和民所增加的支出，相当大的一部分流入了投机商的私囊。
    对医院承包经营的议论
    从整体看，当前我国医疗服务的大形势还是供不应求。在人员、经费、床位还都处于低水平的情况下，经济承包强化内部管理的机制，确实促使医院的管理水平大大提高，管理的力度增强。北京医院管理研究所所长黄慧英说：“一线管理人员，如院长、卫生局长的工作比以前好做多了。岗位责任制的强化推动劳动组合的优化，把医院的资源、效能充分发挥出来，缓解了国拨医疗经费困难的压力。通过多卖药等办法来增加经济收入，是无奈之举。”
    中国人民大学孙光德教授认为：承包的灵魂是利润刺激。医疗单位在利润刺激下必然倾向于人为地增加供给，制造需求。在一般商品和劳务交换中，需求是由消费者决定的。而医疗服务中，医生握有诊断处置权，做什么检查吃什么药，消费者无法决定，医生处于“主导”和“垄断”地位。这就使医疗单位有可能按照医方的愿望，而不是按照患者实际需要，提供“过度服务”。医疗目前是严重短缺部门，消费者对其劳务无法选择，有病非得来不可。现在，医院里带来的某些效益，对社会来说可能就是浪费。
    中国社会科学院经济研究所研究员董辅礽、社会学研究所研究员何建章，及国家计委经济研究中心研究员黄范章等指出：在福利经济学中，医院是负效益机构，即医院的经济效益和社会福利目标是矛盾的。不管病人多少，医院职工的工资、设备的折旧和更新、水电消耗、药品辅料总要支出。而医院唯一正当的收入，只能是病人交纳的纯粹诊疗、处置费。在收费标准确定的前提下，医院的经济效益与看病人数成正比。从经济上考虑，病人越多，效益越高。从社会效益考虑，看病的人越少，说明国民健康状况越好，体现的社会福利越大。医院要是为增加收入，人为地去制造病人就是社会犯罪。由这种特殊性质决定，医院不应该提倡经济承包。实际上，承包对医院的约束机制也是“软”的，如质量指标、医德医风等，都是难以控制的。所以，承包对医疗单位的改革来说，只是短期行为，不宜扩大试点范围。
    中央党校丁宁宁的看法是，实行经济核算、严格预算管理不等于财务层层包干。层层包干，奖金自理，说穿了就是医院各科室自己设法解决医护人员工资低的难题，让医护人员直接从病人身上“创造”经济效益。这是违反医护人员职业道德的做法。医生和病人的地位是不平等的，在病痛和死亡面前，病人没有和医护人员讨价还价的能力。医务工作崇高而任重，关系到整个民族的健康和未来。医护人员的工资应当足以维护其职业的尊严，这是国家的责任，不应当让他们自己去谋求办法。
    卫生部部长陈敏章表示：医德医风问题我们正在努力抓，这是任何时期、任何条件下都不能放松的。对医疗卫生工作，我们曾经有过的一段经历是——一管就死，一放就乱。这正说明存在问题很多，必须进行改革。卫生改革仓促上阵，措施、方法是根本机制上就行不通，还是不健全、不完善？这需要在实践中检验。得不到广大群众认可的，绝不滥施。历史遗留下的问题已经压得我们喘不过气，我们不能再制造新的问题留给后人。热忱希望全社会共同努力，把卫生改革搞好。
