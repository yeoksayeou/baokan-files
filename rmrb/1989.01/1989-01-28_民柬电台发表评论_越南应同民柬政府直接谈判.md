	New China News Agency, Beijing, January 27th: The Khmer People's National Liberation Radio Station today published a commentary stating that Vietnam should directly negotiate with the Khmer People's National Government to resolve the Cambodian issue.

	The commentary said that Prince Norodom Sihanouk's five-point plan to resolve the Cambodian issue has received full support from the Khmer People's National Government, which considers it the "national political program."

	The commentary said that if Vietnam genuinely wants to resolve the Cambodian issue, it should send representatives to directly negotiate with the tripartite coalition government of the Khmer People's National Government, discuss the five-point plan, and especially discuss the issue of unconditionally withdrawing from Cambodia under strict and effective international supervision.
