Soldiers as Husbands and Fathers in the Military Camp

According to the regulations of the "Military Service Law," soldiers whose term of service has not been completed have no chance of being "married." However, the investigation results of a certain unit in the Lanzhou Military Region, which ended in mid-November 1988, are quite different: hidden "soldier fathers" and "soldier husbands" are quietly increasing, and this phenomenon has caused troubles for the construction of the army.

Among the more than 800 soldiers who accepted the investigation, 41 were found to be married, half of whom already have children. Nearly half of these married soldiers were married before they reached the legal marriage age when they enlisted. Some falsified their records by filling in "unmarried" during the recruitment registration, while others used backdoors to alter their files. About 50% of the married soldiers took advantage of leave, personal leave, or secretly returned home to get married. Due to the lack of military proof, three of them have been "married" for more than two years but still do not have a marriage certificate.

The main reasons for these phenomena are the influence of the old concept of "early childbirth, early happiness" in society; some soldiers' families lack labor, or family members are ill and need care; some soldiers are afraid of not finding a partner after demobilization, so they choose to get married early to eliminate worries; in some places, early marriage and early love are prevalent, prompting some soldiers' parents to arrange early marriages for their sons. Some do so before their sons enlist by hastily arranging marriages, while others use fake telegrams or letters claiming that parents are critically ill or deceased to arrange for their sons to return home to get engaged or married.

Early marriage phenomena have increased the burden of management, education, and ideological work in the units.

Stopping early marriage and childbearing in the army has become an urgent task.

### 军营中的“兵丈夫”“兵爸爸”

　　军营中的“兵丈夫”“兵爸爸”
    按《兵役法》规定，服役期未满的战士与“已婚”无缘。兰州军区某部于１９８８年１１月上旬结束的调查结果却与此大相径庭：连队隐蔽的“兵爸爸”、“兵丈夫”悄然增多，这种现象已给部队建设造成烦忧。
    接受调查的８００余名战士中，查明已婚的有４１人，其中有一半战士已经有了小孩。这些已婚战士近半数是入伍前未到婚龄就“结婚”的，征兵登记时有的弄虚作假，填写“未婚”，有的则走后门涂改了档案。约有５０％的已婚战士是利用探亲、事假或私自回家悄悄结婚，由于没有部队证明，有三人“结婚”两年以上，至今连结婚证都没有。
    出现这些现象的原因主要是社会上“早生子、早得福”的旧的生育观念影响；其次是个别战士家中缺少劳力、或家中亲人患病需人照顾；个别战士怕退伍后难找对象，便采取早结婚的办法解除后顾之忧；有些地方早婚早恋成风，促使一些战士的家长过早地给儿子操办婚事，有的在儿子入伍前仓促为其择偶成婚；有的在儿子入伍后则采用发父母“病危”、“病故”的假电报、假信等方法，安排儿子回家订婚、结婚。
    早婚现象给连队管理教育和思想工作增加了负担。
    制止部队中的早婚早育现象已成为当务之急。 　　　　（１月１６日《中国人口报》郭怀亮　张忠培文）
