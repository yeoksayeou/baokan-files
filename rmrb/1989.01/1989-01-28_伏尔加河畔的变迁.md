The Volga River – the mother river of Russia – meanders and winds its way through 3,000 kilometers, flowing majestically into the Caspian Sea. The city of Astrakhan at the river's mouth has a 431-year history and is famous for its sturgeon, caviar, lotus roots, and watermelons.

During the so-called "stagnation period" of the 1960s to the early 1980s in the Soviet Union, Astrakhan was like a forgotten corner, sleeping for many years. Now, the winds of reform have awakened this ancient city, making it vibrant again.

	State Committee’s Door Without Police

On the morning of January 20, Kozlov, the secretary of the State Committee, received interviews from several foreign journalists in the building of the State Party Committee and the Executive Committee of the Soviets. What surprised us was that, unlike other state committees, there were no police standing guard at the entrance. Kozlov smiled and said, "This is a measure taken last March, aiming to get closer to the people, so they can directly find the leaders of the State Committee to reflect the situation."

The State Committee has also streamlined its organizations, abolishing the departments of transportation, construction, light industry, etc., and handing over these tasks to the Executive Committee of the Soviets. The number of staff has been reduced by one-third. The five secretaries of the State Committee hold a working meeting once a month, and spend the rest of the time at the grassroots level to understand the situation and solve problems. The secretary in charge of agriculture has visited four districts, 12 collective farms, and state farms since the beginning of the year.

	Contract System Promotes Production

In recent years, the contract system has been gradually promoted in the Astrakhan region. In the "Motherland" collective farm with 500 households, 16 households have adopted the contract system. The 32-year-old Ismailov couple contracted 60 camels last year. The collective farm advances them 150 rubles each per month. The couple work hard from dawn to dusk, and the camels grow fat and strong. At the end of the year, the collective farm gave them 3,000 rubles and rewarded them with a young camel.

When we visited Ismailov's home, he played the dombra, his joy evident.

In the "Bolshevik" collective farm, 35 kilometers from Astrakhan City, the contract system for fishery and vegetable operations has been implemented for three years. One of the seven-person fishery teams has found ways to reduce costs and catch more fish and shrimp. Last year, their average monthly income reached over 400 rubles each.

Last summer, Astrakhan City added a fish market. After completing the state's supply contracts, fishermen go to the market to sell, although the price is higher than the state contract price, it allows 500,000 city residents to eat more fresh fish, and the fishermen also become wealthy. Many fishermen have built their own houses, added furniture, motorcycles, and cars in the past two years.

	“Green Peace” Protects the Environment

Astrakhan is located in the lower reaches of the Volga River and is very sensitive to water pollution. Vladimir, the chairman of the "Bolshevik" farm, told us that compared to 20 years ago, the water level of the Volga River has decreased, fishery resources have decreased, and industrial pollution is quite serious. He said firmly, "Protecting the Volga River is crucial, we must fight pollution to the end."

More than 100 writers, teachers, and others in Astrakhan have formed the "Green Peace" organization to advocate for ecological protection.

The Soviet Ministry of Natural Gas Industry invested nearly 2.5 billion rubles to build a large comprehensive facility in the semi-desert area 70 kilometers from Astrakhan City, with an annual production of 60 billion cubic meters of natural gas. However, the exhaust pollution far exceeds the regulated standards. Under the pressure of "Green Peace" and local residents, the Ministry of Natural Gas Industry decided to build environmental protection projects and strengthen safety facilities.

The "Green Peace" organization and most residents of Astrakhan oppose the construction of the "Volga-Don" canal in the lower reaches of the Volga River, believing it will cause the water level of the Volga River to further decrease and the ecological environment to deteriorate. Considering public opinion, the State Planning Commission of the Soviet Union has currently proposed to suspend construction and have experts conduct a comprehensive review of the project.

	“White Volga” Cooperative Restaurant

The "Lotus" Hotel is the largest hotel in Astrakhan City. Not far from it is a cooperative restaurant named "White Volga." As soon as we entered, the owner greeted us. There are 20 seats inside, all occupied.

The 42-year-old owner, Alexander Malokin, was previously the manager of a state-owned restaurant. After he opened this restaurant in May last year, the business hours were extended from noon to midnight, which was convenient for customers, and business was booming. In seven months, he made a profit of 16,000 rubles. Now the restaurant has 11 cooks and waiters, with an average monthly salary of 600 rubles, which is twice that of a state-owned restaurant.

Malokin said, "My management philosophy is fair pricing and enthusiastic service. The most important thing is the support of the state."

The official responsible for the registration of Astrakhan cooperatives said that last year, 410 cooperatives were registered in the city, of which 285 are already in operation. These cooperatives mainly sell daily necessities and provide living services, including 30 restaurants.

We asked Malokin if there were any difficulties in running the cooperative restaurant. He said, "Of course, there are many difficulties, and some people do not support us. But as long as you really want to run a cooperative, you will definitely succeed."

　　伏尔加河畔的变迁
    新华社记者  王宪举
    伏尔加河——俄罗斯母亲的河，蜿蜒曲折流经３０００公里，浩浩荡荡注入里海。河口的阿斯特拉罕市已有４３１年历史，以盛产鲟鱼、鱼子酱、莲藕和西瓜著称。
    在苏联称之为“停滞时期”的６０年代中至８０年代初，阿斯特拉罕曾经像是一个被遗忘的角落，沉睡了多年。如今，阵阵改革之风吹醒了这一古城，使它又焕发出青春的活力。
    　　　　州委门前无警察
    １月２０日上午，州委书记科兹洛夫在州党委和苏维埃执委会大楼里接受我们几个外国记者采访。令我们惊奇的是，与其他一些州委不同，大楼门口没有警察站岗。科兹洛夫笑着说，这是去年３月采取的措施，旨在接近群众，使他们能够直接找州委领导反映情况。
    州委还精简了机构，撤销了交通、运输、建筑、轻工业等机构，把这些工作交给苏维埃执委会去管，工作人员减少了１／３。５个州委书记每月开一次工作会议，其他时间多在基层了解情况和解决问题。主管农业的书记年初以来已经跑了４个区、１２个集体农庄和国营农场。
    　　　　承包制促进了生产
    近年来，承包制在阿斯特拉罕州逐步推广。在“祖国”集体农庄５００户庄员中，有１６户搞了承包。３２岁的伊斯梅洛夫夫妇去年承包了６０头骆驼。农庄每月预支给他们每人１５０卢布工资。夫妇俩起早摸黑，辛勤放牧，骆驼长得又肥又壮。年终结算，农庄又分给他们３０００卢布，并奖给一头小骆驼。
    我们在伊斯梅洛夫家作客时，他弹起冬不拉，喜悦之情溢于言表。
    在离阿斯特拉罕市３５公里的“布尔什维克”集体农庄，渔业和蔬菜作业队承包制已实行３年。其中一个７人渔业队，想方设法，降低成本，多捕鱼虾。去年他们每人的月平均收入达４００多卢布。
    去年夏天，阿斯特拉罕城里增设了鱼市。渔民在完成国家的供货合同后，到鱼市上去卖，价格虽高于国家合同价，但使５０多万市民吃到了更多的鲜鱼，渔民也富裕起来。许多渔民近两年自建住宅、添置家具、摩托车和小汽车。
    　　　　“绿色和平”保护生态
    阿斯特拉罕位于伏尔加河下游，对河水的污染十分敏感。“布尔什维克”农庄主席弗拉基米尔对我们说，与２０年前相比，现在伏尔加河水位下降，渔业资源减少，工业污染相当严重。他语气坚定地说：“保护伏尔加河至关重要，我们要同污染斗争到底。”
    阿斯特拉罕有１００多位作家、教师等成立了“绿色和平”组织，为保护生态而呐喊。
    苏联天然气工业部耗资近２５亿卢布，在离阿斯特拉罕市７０公里的半沙漠地带建设了一个年产６０亿立方米天然气的大型综合体，但废气污染程度大大超过规定的标准。在“绿色和平”和当地居民的压力下，天然气工业部决定增建环境保护项目和加强安全设施。
    “绿色和平”组织和阿斯特拉罕大多数居民都反对在伏尔加河下游建设“乔戈拉伊—伏尔加”运河，认为它将导致伏尔加河水位进一步下降，生态环境恶化。考虑到群众的意见，苏联国家计委目前已建议暂停施工，由专家们对这个项目再作全面审查。
    　　　　“白色伏尔加”合作餐馆
    伏尔加河畔的“莲花”饭店是阿斯特拉罕市最大的饭店。离它不远处有一家名为“白色伏尔加”的合作餐馆。我们一进去，主人立即迎了上来。屋里共有２０个座位，坐满了人。
    ４２岁的主人亚历山大·马洛金过去是一家国营饭馆的经理。去年５月他开办这家餐馆后，营业时间延长到从中午１２时至夜里１２时，方便了顾客，生意兴隆，７个月来盈利１．６万卢布。现在餐馆共有炊事员、招待员１１人，平均月薪６００卢布，比国营餐馆高一倍。
    马洛金说：“我的经营之道是价格公道，服务热情。重要的是还有国家的支持。”
    负责阿斯特拉罕合作社登记注册的官员说，去年全市共有４１０家合作社登记注册，其中２８５家已经营业。这些合作社大多是销售日用消费品和从事生活服务，其中餐馆有３０家。
    我们问马洛金，在办合作餐馆过程中有没有困难。他说：“困难当然不少，有些人不支持我们。但是只要你真心想办合作社，就一定会成功。”
