Recently, construction has begun on a modern poultry farm in Fushun with an annual output of 4,500 tons of broilers. This farm, which is being built with a loan from the Dutch government, will use modern equipment for every step from chick hatching to cold storage processing, all controlled by computers. Broilers can be ready for market in just 56 days. After completion in October 1989, the farm will be able to raise 1 million broilers annually and process 3 million broilers. It is expected to generate an annual profit of 5 million yuan. In addition to meeting local market demands, the farm will also be able to export, generating an annual foreign exchange income of 3.5 million US dollars.
