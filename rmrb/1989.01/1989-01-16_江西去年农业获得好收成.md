Jiangxi achieved a bumper harvest in agriculture last year.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Jiangxi overcame various natural disasters in 1988 and achieved a good harvest in agriculture.

In 1988, low temperatures, waterlogging, drought, and other severe natural disasters had extremely adverse effects on Jiangxi's agricultural production. However, the broad masses of cadres and farmers across the province, through persistent efforts, minimized the losses caused by the disasters. The province's total grain output reached 15.159 million metric tons, making it the fourth consecutive year with a grain output exceeding 15 million metric tons in history.
