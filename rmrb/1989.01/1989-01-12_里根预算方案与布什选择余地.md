Outgoing President Reagan presented his final budget plan for his term on January 9. According to this plan, the total expenditure of the U.S. government for the 1990 fiscal year will be $1,150 billion. Without increasing taxes, the budget deficit will be reduced to $92.5 billion, which is below the $100 billion maximum limit set by the Emergency Balanced Budget Law. Richard G. Darman, Director of the Office of Management and Budget, said that Reagan's plan has laid the best foundation for negotiations with Congress for the incoming President Bush.

Bush will present his budget revision plan on February 20. Bush has stated that he supports Reagan's plan but may make some adjustments.

Reagan has significantly reduced expenditures in areas such as medical welfare and agricultural subsidies to cut the budget deficit, which will likely face difficulties in passing through Congress. However, Bush has a $7.5 billion margin between Reagan's deficit and the limit set by the Emergency Balanced Budget Law, allowing him to ease the cuts in social welfare and agricultural subsidies. In terms of military spending, Bush may slightly increase the budget to align with Congress's preferences.

Of course, Bush will also face pressure. According to the Emergency Balanced Budget Law, Bush must reduce the deficit by at least $34 billion. If Bush significantly reduces Reagan's military spending increase, he will face opposition from conservatives. If Bush reduces other social projects to fulfill his campaign promises, his revision plan may also be stalled in Congress.

The biggest unknown in Bush's upcoming budget revision plan appears to be the direction of the U.S. economy. Rather than saying that Reagan's budget has laid a foundation for the new President Bush, it is more accurate to say that the massive fiscal deficit accumulated during Reagan's 8-year term has left a heavy burden for the Bush administration. As the American public reviews Reagan's fiscal budget for the last time, their attention will inevitably shift to Bush's yet-to-be-released budget revision plan.

　　里根预算方案与布什选择余地
    本报记者  景宪法
    即将卸任的里根总统本月９日提出了他任期内的最后一份预算方案。根据这一方案，１９９０财政年度美国政府的支出总额为１１５００亿美元，在不增加税收的前提下，将预算赤字降到９２５亿美元，低于紧急平衡预算法所规定１０００亿美元的最高限额。白宫的行政管理和预算局局长怀特表示，里根方案为即将上任的布什总统在同国会打交道时“奠定了最佳谈判基础”。
    布什将于２月２０日提出自己的预算修改方案。布什表示，他赞同里根方案的意向，但他届时“可能作出更动”。
    里根为削减预算赤字而大幅度削减医疗福利和农业补贴等方面的开支，显然难以在国会通过。但对布什来说，由于他在里根的预算赤字和紧急平衡预算法的限额之间仍有７５亿美元的伸缩余地，因此能够减缓削砍社会福利和农业补贴的幅度。而在军费开支方面，布什则可能以稍事追加预算来迎合国会的口味。
    当然，布什也将面临压力。根据紧急平衡预算法，布什须作出至少削减３４０亿美元的赤字。如果将里根的军费增长预算压缩过多，必将遭到保守派的反对；如果为了照顾自己在竞选中作出的许诺而削减其它社会项目，布什的修改方案届时也可能在国会搁浅。
    布什即将提出的预算修改方案中最大的未知数看来还是美国经济的走势。与其说里根总统的预算为新总统布什奠定了基础，倒不如说是里根任期８年积累的巨额财政赤字给布什政府留下了沉重的负担。在美国公众最后一次翻阅里根总统的财政预算之时，他们更多的注意力必然集中到布什总统尚未出台的预算修改方案上。
