    Xiamen's color photographic material production line, which was completed and put into operation, has produced "Fuda" brand color film and photographic paper. After technical appraisal, the quality of these products has reached the advanced international level of the 1980s.

    The production line, which started operation on the 23rd, can annually produce 1.8 million square meters of "Fuda" brand color film and 9.2 million square meters of color photographic paper. By increasing production, it can save one billion dollars annually.

    Prior to this, China's production of photographic materials accounted for only one percent of the world's total. Among these, black-and-white materials made up the vast majority, while color materials were only a small fraction, with quality standards equivalent to those of the 1960s.

    This imported project is a key project of China's "Seventh Five-Year Plan." With an investment of over 500 million yuan and a construction period of four years, it will have an annual output value of over 300 million yuan and generate over 200 million yuan in taxes and profits after it starts operation.

    厦门引进彩色感光材料生产线建成投产
  　产品“福达”牌彩色胶卷、相纸，经过技术鉴定，质量达到八十年代国际先进水平。
    二十三日投产的这条生产线，可年产“福达”牌彩色胶片一百八十万平方米、彩色相纸九百二十万平方米。以产顶进，每年可节省一亿美元。
    在此之前，我国感光材料产量仅占世界的百分之一。其中，黑白占绝大部分，彩色只是星星点点，质量属六十年代水平。
    这项引进工程，是我国“七五”重点工程。投资五亿多元，工期四年。投产后，年产值三亿多元，税利二亿多元。
