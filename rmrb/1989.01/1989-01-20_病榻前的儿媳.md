In Xinglong Town, Hebei Province, there is a daughter-in-law who has been taking care of her disabled father-in-law for 13 years without a single day of neglect. She is the renowned Jia Rongzhen.

Villagers will never forget the scene from 13 years ago: Old teacher Li Man was severely afflicted with osteomyelitis, his lower limbs paralyzed, and unable to take care of himself. His son, Li Fengxiang, was very young and had to shoulder the responsibility of supporting the family alone. Jia Rongzhen, who lived in Xiaoheshan Village, learned that Li Fengxiang was honest, hardworking, and diligent. She genuinely liked him. Whenever she had time, she would go to the Li family to fetch water, bring medicine, wash clothes, and mend quilts.

In the winter of 1975, Jia Rongzhen married Li Fengxiang. This news spread like wildfire. Some commented on Jia Rongzhen, saying, "She is really foolish. She didn't want to marry into any of the good families that proposed to her, but she was willing to take care of a paralyzed father-in-law!" Others said, "The Li family must have done something good in a past life to have such a good daughter-in-law!"

Every winter, the old man was cold and needed chicken soup and meat soup. Jia Rongzhen would always buy some small chickens in the spring, raise them until winter, and then kill them to make soup for her father-in-law. Sometimes, the chickens she raised were not enough, so she would save money to buy live chickens from the market to make soup for the old man, while she herself would not even take a sip of the soup.

The early morning hours of two or three o'clock are the golden time for sleep, but Jia Rongzhen had developed a habit of waking up at this time to turn her father-in-law over. To prevent bedsores, she made three cotton quilts for the old man to choose from; she frequently washed and changed the wet bedding and small mats...

She thought: Children like to be in a lively environment, and long-term patients need to relax. Therefore, for 13 years, during the afternoons of spring, summer, and autumn, in the streets and alleys of Xinglong Town, by the willow riverbank after the rain, by the swimming pool at the sports field, and on the bustling ring road around the city, people often saw her pushing a four-wheeled wicker chair, with her father-in-law sitting in it.

Jia Rongzhen had children, and both the old and the young depended on her. Whenever she would take care of the old man by carrying his feces and urine, buying grain and medicine, cooking and brewing medicine, or washing clothes by the river, she would use a cotton strap to tie her young children to the window. Hearing the children's hoarse cries, how could she not feel heartbroken? She loved her children, but her conscience told her that the old man needed her more. As the children grew up, they followed their mother's example. From the time they could hold the urine bottle, they started helping their grandfather by carrying his urine and feces. A little older, they would help their mother push their grandfather out for some fresh air, to relax, and to soak up the sun. Jia Rongzhen warmed the disabled old man with a pure and passionate heart.

　　病榻前的儿媳
    刘文中
    在河北省兴隆镇中央村，有一个伺候病残公公１３年如一日的好儿媳妇，她就是远近闻名的贾荣珍。
    乡亲们忘不了１３年前的情景：老教师李满患严重的骨髓炎，下肢截瘫，生活不能自理，儿子李凤翔很小就独自挑起维持全家生计的担子。住在小河南村的贾荣珍了解到李凤翔憨厚老实、勤奋能干，从心眼里喜欢他。一有空，就跑到李家为老人送水拿药、洗衣缝被。
    １９７５年冬，贾荣珍与李凤翔结为夫妻。这消息，如同一条爆炸性新闻。有的议论贾荣珍：“她真是个大傻冒，那么多好人家提亲不愿意，倒乐意去伺候一个瘫公公！”有的说：“老李家不知哪辈子烧高香修来的，娶了这么个好儿媳！”
    一到冬天，老人怕冷，离不了鸡汤、肉汤。贾荣珍总是在春天买点小鸡，饲养到冬天杀了给公公熬汤喝。有时，养的鸡不够吃，她就省吃俭用，上街给老人买活鸡熬汤喝，而自己连一口汤也舍不得咽。
    凌晨两三点钟是睡眠的黄金时间，可是，贾荣珍养成了习惯，每到这个点准醒，为的是给老人翻身。为防止褥疮，她给老人做了３床棉被，任老人挑着盖；经常尿湿的被子、小垫子，她勤洗勤换……
    她想：孩子喜欢热闹，久病的人更需要散散心。于是，１３年的春、夏、秋三季的下午，在兴隆镇的大街小巷，在雨过天晴的柳河岸边，在体育场的游泳池旁，在喧闹的环城公路上，人们经常看到她推着四轮藤椅车，车上坐着她的公公。
    贾荣珍生了孩子，老的小的都靠她照顾。每当她为老人端屎端尿时、为老人买粮请医时、为老人做饭熬药时、到河边洗洗涮涮时，就用一根棉布带子把幼小的儿女绑在窗户边。听着孩子那嘶哑的啼叫，她怎能不揪心呢？她爱自己的儿女，然而良知告诉她：老人更需要她。儿女们长大了，也照着妈妈的样子做，从能拿动尿罐时起就替爷爷接尿端屎，稍大一点便帮妈妈推着爷爷出去乘凉、散心、晒太阳。贾荣珍以一颗纯朴而炽热的心温暖着病残老人。
