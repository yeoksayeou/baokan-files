The People's Daily reports that in Wencheng County, Kouzhen Township, a consultative dialogue activity was conducted between cadres and the masses, which alleviated the dissatisfaction of the farmers. The entire township saw a new situation where farmers enthusiastically sold their contracted grain.

In 1987, this township, which has only 35 villages, had 11 village party branch secretaries who requested to resign. The relationship between cadres and the masses was tense, specifically manifesting in three aspects: matters that should be discussed were not discussed, and the masses had complaints; matters that should be handled were not handled, and the masses had grievances; things that should be said were not said, and the masses had misunderstandings. The masses were upset because: water conservancy facilities and agricultural machinery were damaged and no one organized repairs; due to historical reasons, collective debts to individuals were not settled; family planning methods were simple, and cadres did not take the lead, etc. During the consultative dialogue, the masses poured out their grievances, which touched the cadres and made them realize that rights and obligations are two-way. They cannot just demand from the masses but also need to "give" to the masses. Therefore, they decided to serve the masses well. In the entire township, more than 10 villages repaired water conservancy facilities, and the masses' fields were irrigated, their faces showed smiles, and the contracted grain was sold.

The other important reason for the tense relationship between cadres and the masses is that some cadres are subjective and arbitrary. The masses said: what is done is public business, but public business is not made public.

In Shanqianpu Village, the power supply was cut off because the village could not pay the collective electricity bill, and the masses suspected that the public funds had been "misappropriated." The cadres and the masses conducted a dialogue and disclosed the detailed accounts of the public funds usage over the past few years. Seeing the clear accounts, the masses understood the cadres' difficulties, and within half a day, they voluntarily paid half a year's public funds in advance to the village. The village cadres paid the electricity bill in the afternoon, and the village had lights in the evening.

　　开展协商对话　密切干群关系
    文登市口子乡农民踊跃交售定购粮
    本报讯  山东文登市口子乡开展干群对话活动，缓解了农民的不满情绪，全乡出现农民踊跃交售定购粮的新局面。
    １９８７年，这个仅有３５个村的乡竟有１１个村的党支部书记要求辞官。干群关系紧张，具体表现在三个方面：该商量的事情不商量，群众有意见；该办的事情不办，群众有怨言；该说的话不说，群众有误解。群众有气是因为：水利设施、农业机械损坏了无人组织修复；由于历史原因，集体欠个人的旧帐不兑现；计划生育方式简单，干部不带头等等。在协商对话中，群众一古脑儿吐出了心中的怨气，使乡、村干部思想受到触动，认识到权利和义务是双向的，不能对群众光有要求，同时也要有“给”的。于是他们下决心为群众搞好服务，在全乡有１０多个村整修了水利设施，群众地里浇上了水，脸上露出了笑，征购粮交齐了。青石河村一台脱谷机坏了，群众年年脱小麦“抓瞎”，窝着火高低不卖定购粮。１９８８年支部书记凑了钱买了台脱谷机为群众服务，结果这个几年来从没交定购粮的村破天荒一次交齐。
    干群关系紧张的另一个重要原因，是有些干部主观武断。群众说：办的是公家的事，公家的事却不公开。
    山前埠村因无力交付集体电费被“卡”了电，群众怀疑提留款“走了私”。干群开展对话把几年来提留款使用情况的老底亮给群众。看了那一清二楚的帐目，群众理解了干部的苦楚，一个上午就自动将半年提留提前交给村里，村干部下午去付了电费，村里晚上就亮了灯。
