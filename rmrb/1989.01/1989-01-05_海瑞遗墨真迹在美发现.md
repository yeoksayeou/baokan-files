Recently, in the home of a Chinese-American in Houston, four Tang Dynasty poems handwritten by Hai Rui, a censor during the Ming Dynasty, were discovered. After being authenticated by experts, these poems were confirmed to be genuine works by Hai Rui.

The four pieces of calligraphy, each with a main axis of 1.3 meters in height and 0.47 meters in width, are respectively written with poems by Tang Dynasty poets Dai Shulun's "Staying at Shitou Inn on New Year's Eve," Quande Xing's "Seeing Off Kong Zhen Shi," Wen Tingyun's "Early Autumn in the Mountains," and Ma Dai's "Passing by the Residence of a Wild Hermit."

Hai Rui was born in 1514 and died in 1587. His handwritten works are extremely rare. Currently, the Hai Rui Exhibition Hall in Haikou City has several stone inscriptions of Hai Rui's calligraphy, including four stone-carved poems that were once praised by Kang Youwei for their "unique and extraordinary brushwork." The original pieces are the four calligraphy works discovered this time.

Xu Niao Yu, who owns these four genuine works of Hai Rui's calligraphy, said that he discovered these four pieces of calligraphy while sorting through his late grandfather's collection 20 years ago. At that time, he thought it was impossible for them to be genuine, so he did not pay much attention to them. In 1984, Xu saw a book titled "The Complete Works of Hai Zhongjie Gong" in New York by chance and found that the stone rubbings of these four pieces of calligraphy were included in the book. Over the past four years, Xu has thoroughly researched materials and consulted with experts, finally confirming recently through expert authentication that these four pieces of calligraphy are indeed genuine works by Hai Rui.

　　海瑞遗墨真迹在美发现
    新华社纽约１月３日电（记者雷力利）最近在美国休斯顿的一位华侨家中发现了中国明朝御史海瑞亲手书写的四首唐诗。经有关专家鉴定，这些唐诗确系海瑞遗墨真迹。
    这四幅遗墨的主轴各高１．３米，宽０．４７米，分别书写的是唐代诗人戴叔伦的《除夜宿石头驿》，权德兴的《送孔征士》，温庭筠的《早秋山户》和马戴的《过野叟居》。
    海瑞生于１５１４年，卒于１５８７年，其手书真墨传世极少。目前海口市海瑞陈列室存有海瑞书法若干碑刻，其中四块曾被康有为推誉为“笔法奇矫”的唐诗石刻字，原件即这次发现的四幅书法。
    收藏这四幅海瑞遗墨真迹的许孖羽先生说，他是在２０年前清理已故祖父家藏时发现这四幅书法的。当时他认为这不可能是真迹，也就未予理会。１９８４年，许先生在纽约无意中看到一本《海忠介公全集》，发现这四幅书法的石刻拓本都收藏于书中。近４年来，许先生遍查资料，走访专家，终于在最近由专家鉴定查明这四幅书法确实是海瑞遗墨真迹。
