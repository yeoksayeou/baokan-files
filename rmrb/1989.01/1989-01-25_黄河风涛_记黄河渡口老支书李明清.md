Recently, I took the opportunity of attending the Luo-Lan Economic Promotion Conference in Luoyang to drive back to the old Yellow River crossing at Baipo in Jili District.

This is a new industrial area in Luoyang City. The Luoyang-Baotou Railway and the vast Yellow River run parallel here, while the Jiaozuo-Zhuzhou Railway and the Yellow River Bridge cross from east to west. The vast expanse of the countryside is like a painting. I took a deep breath of the fresh air and recalled the scenes from my previous two visits to the old Yellow River crossing at Baipo to see the respected and legendary figure, Li Mingqing.

The first time we met was exactly 40 years ago. On July 17, 1948, I accompanied the army southward and passed through Baipo Village, which had over 300 households. At that time, the 23-year-old village head, Li Mingqing, was the commander of the fleet of boats transporting the army across the river. He had a fiery gaze and a stubborn expression, as if he had an endless supply of energy. He told me that he had learned to row a boat from his father at the crossing since he was a child. Later, he learned blacksmithing from his uncle while fleeing famine. Before liberation, he was one of the first members of the underground party in the village. At that time, Commander Zhu, Commander Liu Bocheng, and Political Commissar Deng Xiaoping had all taken his boat across the river. He said the most unforgettable thing was when Commander Liu Bocheng, dressed in a light gray cotton military uniform, strode to the crossing, picked up a handful of riverbank soil, and with a warm yet firm voice, instructed him, "The people have suffered for many years. Now it's time for a nationwide counterattack. This place will forever be the people's land. You must lead the people to plant trees, grow soybeans, and peanuts on the Yellow River bank to improve the people's lives as quickly as possible." That night, a heavy rain fell, and Li Mingqing, bare-chested, commanded seven large wooden boats to send our news team across the roaring Yellow River.

The second time we met was half a year ago. With a bit of luck, I found Baipo based on my old military diary and was fortunate to see Li Mingqing, affectionately known as "Old Secretary." His eyes were still as bright as ever, but his temples were white, and unfortunately, he had suffered a stroke and was resting at home, serving as an advisor to the young secretary. From our conversation, I learned that he had high blood pressure but never spared himself. He led everyone to dig 100 mu of fish ponds by the Yellow River, and the next year, they provided 250 kilograms of golden carp to the capital. After loading the fish, he was exhausted and sweating profusely. On his way home, he suddenly felt dizzy and fainted, resulting in a stroke. However, he was not content to stay at home doing nothing, so every morning, he struggled to the Yellow River to exercise, determined to recover and work hard again.

The next morning, I went to his house at the village entrance and saw him from a distance, using a cane to hobble towards the river. I caught up with him, and we walked together to a stone embankment not far from the old crossing and sat down. Li Mingqing lit a cigarette, looked at the old crossing with deep emotion, and then said in a deep voice, "Look at the Yellow River water, it often has waves, but it always swirls forward. My journey these past few decades has been like this. In 1958, I worked in the township, and the township leaders reported a grain yield of 4,000 kilograms per mu. I said that was nonsense, deceiving the central government and harming the people. Some said I was a rightist, and after being criticized, I was demoted. I returned to the village and developed the Yellow River bank with the people. Later, I was appointed village secretary, and I led everyone to build water conservancy projects, divert the Yellow River for irrigation, and the grain yield doubled in one year. When the Cultural Revolution came, they said I was suppressing the revolution with production, and I became the 'biggest capitalist roader' in Baipo. Several rebels wanted me to hand over power, but I said you're not even a party member, so I can't hand over power. They forced me and the people to the riverbank for 'labor reform.' I thought this was a good opportunity to fulfill Commander Liu Bocheng's instructions to me, and I persisted here for three years despite my illness, clearing the land and planting tens of thousands of trees, which are now mostly mature..."

Old Li led me to a forest, using his cane to support himself and pointing around, saying, "Look, the 100 mu of fish ponds near the Yellow River Bridge have fat carp, and the 3,000 mu of irrigated land on the other side of the crossing has good harvests of wheat, soybeans, and peanuts every year. Look at the large patch of white poplar trees on the river island, they are so robust. Alas, it's a pity that the group of cows inside is not well taken care of, and now there are only a few left. I've been thinking day and night about how to quickly utilize the 100 mu of young forest and grassland under our feet, build a large farm, and a processing plant. Baipo's future is bright! If only Commander Liu Bocheng could come to see..."

He looked at me and said, "You've been to many places, I have two requests. First, you know that the changes in Baipo have come at a great cost, but some leaders above have forgotten the revolutionary traditions, only caring about enjoying themselves and seeking personal gain, and even want to exploit the farmers. When you see them, ask them if they have forgotten the hardships of the war years? Will they still eat and wear clothes in the future? Second, can you help me get some high-quality dairy cows and fine-wool sheep from Xinjiang? I agreed wholeheartedly to do my best. He nodded satisfactorily, smiled at the flocks of seagulls calling in the sky over the Yellow River, and the wrinkles on his face relaxed.

Half a year later, this time I came to Baipo with a heart full of fire, wanting to tell Old Li that I would arrange for fine-wool sheep during my upcoming trip to Xinjiang. As soon as I entered the courtyard, I called out, "Old Li!" No one answered, and the house was quiet. Perhaps he had recovered and gone to the Yellow River bank again? Just as I was wondering, his daughter-in-law came out from the west room, her face solemn, saying, "My father-in-law, he... he passed away 7 days ago." "Ah!?..." The sudden bad news made my heart constrict, and I stared at Old Li's portrait on the wall, unable to say a word for a long time.

Several village cadres and Old Li's son came in and said that in the past half year, Baipo's industry and agriculture had developed again, with two more trucks added to the collective, over a hundred walk-behind tractors for individual households, and more than 100 new brick houses built. Everyone praised "Old Secretary" for his unyielding spirit despite his illness, always rushing to the riverbank, and still giving everyone lectures on how to accelerate the development of Baipo's economy, working himself to death. Even on his deathbed, he still muttered about you, about building a farm and a processing plant.

I stood by the old Yellow River crossing with a heavy and excited heart, listening to the Yellow River waves, recalling scene after scene.

May we have more people like Li Mingqing in our real lives!

　　黄河风涛
    ——记黄河渡口老支书李明清
    本报记者  吕建中
    前些日子，我趁在洛阳开陇兰经济促进会的机会，驱车重访吉利区白坡老黄河渡口。
    这里是洛阳市一个新兴工业区。陇海铁路和滔滔黄河平行地由此穿过，焦枝铁路和黄河公路桥由东西两侧横跨其间，辽阔的原野风光如画。我尽情地吸着清爽的气息，追忆起前两次访问白坡老黄河渡口那位可敬的风云人物李明清的情景。
    第一次相见过去了整整４０年。１９４８年７月１７日，我随军南下途经这三百多户的白坡村，当时载运大军渡河船队的总指挥就是２３岁的村长李明清。一双火爆眼睛，一脸倔强的神态，像是全身有永远使不完的力气。他告诉我，自己从小跟父亲在渡口学撑船，后来又在逃荒中跟叔父学打铁，解放前夕他是村里的第一批地下党员。当时，朱总司令、刘伯承司令员和邓小平政委都在这渡口坐过他撑的船。他说最难忘的一件事，就是身穿浅灰色土布军装的刘伯承司令员，健步来到渡口，抓起一把河滩土，以亲切而坚定的语气嘱咐他说：“老百姓受了多年苦，现在要全国大反攻了，这里从此永远是人民的天下了。你们要领导群众在这黄河滩上栽树、种大豆、花生，尽快改善人民生活。”当夜大雨，李明清光着膀子指挥七条大木船，把我们新闻大队送过咆哮的黄河。
    第二次相见是半年前的事，我抱着试试看的心情，按当年的随军日记找到了白坡，而且幸运地见到了被人们亲切称呼为“老支书”的李明清。他两眼还是那样炯炯有神，只是鬓发苍白，不幸得了偏瘫症，在家休养，给年轻的支书当参谋。从攀谈中得知，他患高血压，可他从不顾惜自己的身子，领着大伙在黄河边挖了１００亩鱼塘，第二年向首都提供了２５０公斤金鳞红尾鲤鱼。他帮着装完车，累得大汗淋漓，回家路上忽觉眼前一阵发黑，晕倒在地，落下个偏瘫症。可他不甘心从此呆在家里无所作为，便每天早晨挣扎着到黄河边锻炼，一心争取康复了再大干一场。
    第二天凌晨，我来到村头他家门口，远远望见他拄着拐棍一颠一颠地向河边走，我赶上去和他一起走到离老渡口不远的一段石堤上坐下来。李明清点上一支烟，深情地望着老渡口，然后用深沉的语气说：你看这黄河水，常有风浪，可它总打着漩儿一直朝前流。我这几十年走过的路也是这样，１９５８年我在乡里工作，乡里领导上报粮食亩产４０００公斤，我说那是瞎胡吹，上骗中央，下害群众。有人说我是右倾分子，斗完了，又撤职，我回村和群众一起开发黄河滩。后来又叫我当村支书，我领着大伙办水利，引黄灌溉，粮食产量一年就翻番。“文化大革命”一来，又说我以生产压革命，我成了白坡“最大的走资派”，几个造反派要我交权，我说你连党员都不是，不能交，他们便硬赶我和群众到河滩上“劳动改造”。我想，这正好实现当年刘伯承司令员对我的嘱托，我在这里带病坚持干了３年，开荒栽下了这几万棵树，如今已大半成材了……
    老李领我走向一片树林，用拐棍支撑着身子，向四周指指点点地说：你看，靠黄河大桥那１００亩鱼塘里的鲤鱼肥着哩，渡口那边３０００亩河滩水浇地，小麦、黄豆和花生年年好收成，你再看河心岛上那一大片毛白杨长得多壮实。唉，只可惜里头那群牛没上心的人照管，如今剩下没几头了。我日夜琢磨着，尽快把脚下这１００多亩幼林和草场利用起来，办大牧场，办加工厂，白坡的发展前途大着哩！要是刘伯承司令员能再来看看……唔，不说这了，你跑的地方多，我托你两件事，第一件，你知道，白坡的变化来之不易啊，可上边有些干部把革命老传统丢了，光顾呆在上面图享受，谋私利，还想挖农坑农，你见了面问问这些人忘没忘战争年代的艰难？他们今后还吃粮穿衣不？第二件，你费心给我弄些良种奶牛和新疆细毛羊来行不行？我满口答应尽力照办。他满意地点点头，笑望黄河上空那一群群??欢叫的海鸥，脸上的皱纹舒展开了。
    时隔半年。这回我心里像怀着一团火跑到白坡，想告诉老李我要乘这次新疆之行给他办细毛羊的事。我一进院就喊“老李！”没人应声，进屋，依然静悄悄的。兴许是他身体康复又去黄河滩了？正疑惑间，他儿媳从西屋出来，沉着脸说：“俺爹他，他刚过世７天！”“啊！？……”这突如其来的噩耗使我的心猛一缩，凝视着墙壁上老李的遗像，久久说不出一句话来。
    几位村干部和老李的儿子接着都来了，说这半年来白坡的工农业又有发展，集体添置了两辆卡车，个体户的手扶拖拉机有上百辆，又盖了１００多幢红砖瓦房。大伙交口称赞“老支书”身残志不残，成天撑着病身子往河滩上跑哇，还给大伙讲如何加快发展白坡经济，硬是把自己累死了。他临终前还断断续续地念叨着你，念叨着办牧场和加工厂的事。
    我怀着沉痛而又激动的心情来到老黄河渡口，听着黄河风涛，追忆着一幕幕往事。
    愿我们现实生活中再多一些李明清精神吧！
