Since modern times, people often criticize Chinese traditional culture for "emphasizing empty rhetoric and neglecting practical benefits," believing that non-utilitarianism is an important characteristic of Chinese culture, while emphasizing utilitarianism is an important characteristic of Western culture. In fact, this generalization is too simplistic and not entirely accurate.

Since ancient Greece, Western philosophy has had a spirit of "seeking truth for the sake of truth" and "seeking knowledge for the sake of knowledge," persistently pursuing and exploring questions such as what the fundamental nature of the world is, which have no practical significance. This pursuit and exploration have allowed pure speculative logic and philosophy to develop in the West. Moreover, contemplation and meditation on the ever-changing "heavenly principles" often evoke a sense of awe, making it easy to stir up a strong desire to transcend the worldly. In contrast, Chinese traditional culture believes that "heavenly principles are distant, human principles are near," and thus turns to focus on human affairs because heavenly principles are difficult to understand. Confucian theory is concerned with relationships between people, aiming to construct a theoretical system without caring about or despising the pursuit of the origins of heavenly principles and the exploration of what heavenly principles are far removed from human affairs. Moreover, Confucianism also believes that "heaven and man share the same virtue," and thus "fulfilling one's nature is knowing heaven." The important thing is to reflect on oneself, emphasizing self-cultivation, "three self-reflections," and the study of mind and nature. The essence of this organic natural view of "unity of heaven and man" is to use heavenly principles to prove human principles, using the orderliness of heavenly principles to explain the necessity of human principles, with a practical purpose. It is this attitude of "fulfilling one's nature is knowing heaven" that makes ethics the core of Chinese philosophy, while pure speculative logic and philosophy have not developed in China. This focus on the self also makes it difficult for people to develop that mysterious religious sentiment of seeking transcendence, so Chinese religions mostly remain at the primitive utilitarian stage of praying for the elimination of disasters and avoidance of calamities, lacking the profound thinking and deep theory of foreign religions. Therefore, an ethical system with introspective reflection as its core and interpersonal relationships and social order as its framework becomes the mainstay of Chinese philosophy. It pursues the perfection of the individual and the stability of society, emphasizing direct worldly social effects, with no concern for pure speculative ontology and epistemology. Therefore, Hegel, using European philosophy as the standard, contemptuously believed that China had no philosophy.

The differences in cultural values between the East and West are also evident in the realm of aesthetics. In the Western aesthetic system, beauty is often considered to be non-utilitarian, and only by rising above practical utility can aesthetic judgments be made and aesthetic enjoyment be obtained. Therefore, the principle of "art for art's sake" and the pursuit of "pure art" by many Western artists are advocated. In contrast, Chinese culture, which emphasizes "practical reason," believes that truth, goodness, and beauty are inseparable, and only things that are both true and good can be beautiful. In Confucian aesthetic consciousness, the moral educative function of art is particularly emphasized, and the practical utilitarian purpose of art serving society and politics is valued. "Literature carries the Way" has always been the dominant idea. Poetry and music are also considered to be tools of moral education, "gentle and kind, this is the education of poetry; ... broad and easy, this is the education of music. ... In one's character, gentle and kind but not foolish, this is the depth of poetry; ... broad and easy but not extravagant, this is the depth of music." Confucius, upon hearing the Shao music, did not eat meat for three months and condemned licentious music as capable of destroying a country. Painting is also considered to should "clearly admonish and illustrate rise and fall." "Painting, completing moral education, assisting human relationships, exhausting divine transformations, measuring the profound and subtle. With the Six Classics sharing the same function, the four seasons running in parallel." The social function of art is indeed great!

In contrast to the emphasis on utilitarianism in the spiritual realm, in the material realm of society, Chinese culture, dominated by Confucianism, advocates a non-utilitarian approach. Nobility of virtue and contempt for profit is the orthodox social ideology, and those who "understand profit" are petty people, while gentlemen "understand virtue" and "seek the Way, not food." Material production activities are placed in a humble position. Therefore, Confucius criticized Fan Chi for being a petty person for asking to learn farming and gardening. Traditional culture generally holds a contemptuous attitude towards science and technology. The reason why ancient Chinese records of celestial phenomena and astronomical research are advanced is also because they want to see auspicious and inauspicious signs from celestial phenomena and to explain and predict human affairs with heavenly principles. Moral articles are the "Way above form," while science and technology are merely the "tools below form" and petty skills. In the material realm of society, the West, however, advocates extreme utilitarianism, believing that the pursuit of personal interests is the fundamental driving force for economic development, and "Protestant ethics" even regards making money as one's duty, as if to release all human energy to conquer nature, pursue interests, and take risks. Some people believe that this "Faustian spirit" in Western culture is the secret to its wealth and military strength. Therefore, since modern times, many progressive Chinese people who have sought truth in the West have hoped to introduce this "Faustian spirit" into Chinese culture to transform traditional values.

This non-utilitarianism also makes Chinese political spirit have a distinct ethical and moral orientation, neglecting organization and institutions. This idea also originates from the "unity of heaven and man" view of heavenly principles. The essence of politics is considered to be "acting on behalf of heaven," rather than the coordination and distribution of power and interests. Therefore, "the way of establishing a country should take the people's hearts as the foundation." The political spirit with a moral orientation necessarily emphasizes duty, neglecting rights; emphasizes moral education to unite and bind all parties, ignoring the coordinating and restraining functions of organizational institutions. Self-cultivation, family management, and governing the country and pacifying the world are all moral practices. Governing by virtue is the Way of the Sage, while governing by law is the inferior Way of the Hegemon. Law is only a supplement to morality, to the extent that one would rather "abolish the military" and "abolish food" than "abolish trust." "Guiding with virtue and harmonizing with rites" is the ideal way of governing a country. "Rites prevent before the crime is committed, laws prevent after the crime is committed," and rites are considered to be a more fundamental and important means of "maintaining the people's hearts" and strengthening rule. Therefore, the vanguards of the New Culture Movement of the May Fourth era did not merely satisfy themselves with the overthrow of the feudal system but, with great insight, shouted the stirring slogan of "overthrowing the cannibalistic rites," aiming to recast the spirit of Chinese political culture.

The transformation of tradition is not easy. Moreover, it is not necessarily appropriate to discuss the merits and demerits of tradition apart from specific temporal and spatial contexts. For example, the characteristic of Chinese cultural tradition that emphasizes the spiritual practical value and neglects material interests, under certain conditions, helps people overcome material poverty, invigorate the spirit, and pursue a noble ideal; on the other hand, can't we also see the shadow of this tradition in the fact that more than ten years ago, in the spiritual realm, there was a strong advocacy of "learning what is urgently needed," equating literary creation and academic research directly with political activities, while in the material production realm, there was a strong criticism of "profit-oriented" and "productivism"? Therefore, the role of tradition does not entirely depend on tradition itself, but rather on the subjective consciousness of the inheritors of tradition, that is, how to creatively transform tradition according to specific temporal and spatial contexts. This requires, first of all, a clear and objective understanding and summary of the characteristics of tradition, and then creative integration and transformation.

　　传统文化的“虚文”与“实利”
    雷颐
    近代以来，人们往往指责中国传统文化“重虚文、轻实利”，认为非功利性是中国文化的重要特征，而强调功利性则是西方文化的重要特征。其实，这种概括过于简单，不尽准确。
    自古希腊以来，西方哲学就有一种“为真理而求真理”，“为知识而求知识”的精神，执著地追寻和探索诸如世界的本原究竟是什么这类并无实用意义的问题。这种追寻和探索使纯思辩的逻辑与哲学在西方得以发展，而且，对变幻莫测的“天道”的沉思冥想，常常使一种敬畏感油然而生，内心很容易激起强烈的企求超越现世的宗教情绪。而中国的传统文化却认为“天道远，人道迩”，因天道难知转而注重人事。儒家理论所关心的是人与人之间的关系，要构建一种理论体系，并不介意也不屑于追本求源，探索远离人事的“天道”究竟是什么。而且，儒学还认为“天人合其德”，因而“尽性即知天”。重要的是反求诸己，强调慎独、修身、“三省吾身”的心性之学。这种“天人合一”的有机自然观的实质，在于以天道证人道，以天道的有序来说明人道的必然，有着浅近的实际目的。正是这种“尽性即知天”的态度，使伦理学成为中国哲学的核心，而纯思辩的逻辑与哲学在中国终未发达起来。这种对自身的专注也使人难以产生那种追求超越的神秘的宗教情绪，所以中国的宗教大都停留在祈求消灾免难的原始实用阶段，缺乏异域宗教那种邈远的玄思和精深的理论。因此，以内向反思为核心，以外向人际关系、社会秩序为构架的伦理学体系就成为中国哲学的主干。它追求的是个人的完善与社会的稳定，强调的是直接现世的社会效果，无所谓于纯思辩的本体论、认识论。因此，黑格尔曾以欧洲哲学为标准，轻蔑地认为中国没有哲学。
    中西方文化价值观念的不同，在审美领域的表现也很明显。在西方的美学体系中，美往往被认为是超功利的，只有超出现实功利之上，才能作出审美判断，得到审美享受。所以，主张“为艺术而艺术”、追求“纯艺术”的唯美主义原则为许多西方艺术家所信奉。而注重“实践理性”的中国文化则认为真、善、美是不可分割的，只有既真且善的事物才可能是美的。在儒家的审美意识中，特别强调艺术“善”的教化功能，重视艺术为社会政治服务的实用功利目的。“文以载道”始终是占主导地位的观念。诗歌音乐也被认为是一种教化的工具，“温柔敦厚，诗教也；……广博易良，乐教也。……其为人也，温柔敦厚而不愚，则深于诗者也；……广博易良而不奢，则深于乐者也”。孔子闻韶乐竟至三月不食肉味，并谴责靡靡之音可以亡国。绘画艺术也被认为应该“明劝戒，著升沉”。“画者，成教化，助人伦，穷神变，测幽微。与六籍同功，四时并运”。艺术的社会功能，可谓大矣！
    与精神领域内强调功利性相反，在社会物质领域内，以儒学占主导地位的中国文化却推崇一种非功利性。贵义贱利是社会的正统观念，“喻于利”的是小人，而君子则“喻于义”、“谋道不谋食”。物质生产活动被置于卑微的位置。所以孔子斥责“请学稼”、“请学为圃”的樊迟为小人。传统文化对科学技术一般也持轻视态度。中国古代天象记录、天文研究之所以发达，也是因为要从天象见吉凶，要以天道来解释、预测人事。道德文章是“形上之道”，而科学技术只是“形下之器”的雕虫小技。在社会物质领域，西方却强调极端的功利主义，认为追求个人利益是经济发展的根本动力，“新教伦理”甚至把赚钱作为人的天职看待，似乎要释放出人类的全部能量来征服自然、追逐利益、铤而走险。一些人认为，西方文化中的这种“浮士德精神”，是其富国强兵、耀武扬威的奥秘所在。因此，近代以来，许多向西方寻求真理的先进的中国人，都企望能将这种“浮士德精神”输入到中国文化中去，改造传统价值观念。
    这种非功利性也使中国的政治精神有着明显的伦理道德取向，轻视组织制度。这种观念也来源于“天人合一”的天道观。政者，正也。政治的本质被认为是“替天行道”，而非权力、利益的协调与分配。所以，“立国之道当以人心为本”。道德取向的政治精神必然强调义务，轻视权利；强调以道德教化来凝聚约束各方，忽视组织制度的配合与制约功能。修身齐家与治国平天下一以贯之，都是一种道德实践。以德治国是王道，以法治国则是等而次之的霸道。法律只是道德的补充，以至于宁可“去兵”、“去食”，也不能“去信”。“道之以德，齐之以礼”是理想的治国之道。“礼禁未蒙之前，法禁已然之后”，礼被认为是一种更为根本、更为重要的“维持人心”、加强统治的手段。因此，五四新文化的先锋并不满足于封建制度的被推翻，而极富洞见地喊出了打倒“吃人的礼教”这一激动人心的口号，以重铸中国政治文化精神。
    对传统的改造并不容易。而且，离开具体时空环境来谈传统的优与劣，也未必恰当。如中国文化传统中强调精神实用价值而轻视物质利益的特点，在特定条件下有助于人们克服物质的贫乏，振奋精神，追求一种高尚的理想；另一方面，人们从十余年前那种在精神领域大力提倡“急用先学”，把文学创作、学术研究直接等同于政治活动，同时却又在物质生产领域对“利润挂帅”、“唯生产力论”大加批判，不是也可看到这种传统的影子吗？
    因此，传统的作用并不完全取决于传统本身，而是取决于传统的承继者的主体意识，即如何根据具体的时空环境对传统进行创造性转换。这就要求首先要对传统的特点有一个清醒的认识和客观的总结，然后才能进行创造性的整合与转换。
