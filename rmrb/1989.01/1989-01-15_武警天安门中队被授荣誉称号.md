　　武警天安门中队被授荣誉称号
    本报讯  １月１４日，中国人民武装警察部队在北京举行授予十一中队“天安门模范中队”荣誉称号命名大会。
    天安门中队于１９８２年进驻天安门地区，担负升降国旗和人民英雄纪念碑、金水桥、天安门广场的警卫任务，去年１０月，又接受了天安门城楼的警卫任务。６年来，干部战士把强烈的爱国之情倾注在神圣的哨位上，为维护天安门地区的安宁和祖国的尊严作出了突出贡献。中队４次荣立集体三等功，３８名干部战士分别荣立二等功和三等功。
    国务委员、公安部部长王芳和武警部队司令员李连秀在会上要求全国武警认真学习天安门模范中队，学习他们为祖国乐于奉献一切的革命精神。
    最近，杨尚昆为该中队题词：“光荣哨位，神圣职责”。
