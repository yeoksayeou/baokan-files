As the deadline for the Soviet withdrawal approaches, the Soviet public opinion believes that the situation in Afghanistan is complicated and uncertain.

The 28th edition of the *Sovietskaya Rossiya* newspaper published a report titled "An Unsettling Winter in Kabul," which, from the title to the content, gives the impression that Afghanistan is on the brink of a full-scale civil war.

The author of the article acknowledges that the resistance forces have achieved some victories and control most of the territory, but the Kabul regime's army holds key strategic positions, and both sides maintain a rough military balance.

*Izvestiya* reported yesterday that the 2 million residents of the Afghan capital mainly rely on grain supplied by the Soviet Union. The resistance forces plan to blockade Kabul to force the Kabul regime to surrender.

Given the approaching deadline for the Soviet withdrawal and the increasingly complex situation in Afghanistan, Soviet officials have successively visited Kabul. Following Foreign Minister Shevardnadze's visit to Afghanistan earlier this month, Defense Minister Yazov arrived in Kabul yesterday and immediately held talks with the current regime's leader Najibullah. Local sources believe that Yazov's visit aims to make final arrangements for the Soviet withdrawal and help the Kabul regime cope with the situation.

　　苏联舆论对阿富汗局势表示担忧    
    认为局势错综复杂前途未卜面临全面内战
    新华社莫斯科１月２８日电  随着苏联撤军的最后期限临近，苏联舆论界认为阿富汗局势错综复杂，前途未卜。
    ２８日《苏维埃俄罗斯报》发表了一篇题为《喀布尔令人不安的冬天》的通讯，文章从题目到内容都令人感到，阿富汗将爆发一场全面内战。
    文章作者承认抵抗力量取得了一些胜利，并控制了大部分国土，但喀布尔政权军队占据着重要战略要地，双方大体上保持了军事上的均势。
    《消息报》昨晚发表综述说，阿富汗首都２００万居民主要靠苏联供应的粮食维生，抵抗力量打算封锁喀布尔，迫使喀布尔政权投降。
    鉴于苏联撤军期限将至和阿富汗局势日益复杂，苏联要人相继访问喀布尔。继谢瓦尔德纳泽外长本月中旬访阿之后，国防部长亚佐夫又于昨天抵达喀布尔，并马上同现政权首脑纳吉布拉举行会谈。此间人士认为，亚佐夫之行目的是为苏联撤军作最后安排，并帮助喀布尔政权应付局面。
