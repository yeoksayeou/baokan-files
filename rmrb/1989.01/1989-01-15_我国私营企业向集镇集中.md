Currently, the number of private enterprises in China is relatively small, with the vast majority located in rural areas. Rural private enterprises are showing a trend of regional concentration—seeking higher economic and operational benefits, private enterprises scattered across various villages will gradually move towards central townships or county seats. Central townships and county seats are the economic, political, cultural, and social activity centers of rural communities. Compared to villages, these places offer more convenient living conditions, better transportation, more timely information, and better infrastructure, which are conducive to conducting purchasing and sales activities and various economic activities. Moreover, the residents here have a higher level of civilization, and social economic management is more standardized, providing more security and stability. There are two main paths for private enterprises to concentrate in central townships: First, entrepreneurs directly invest and hire workers to start businesses and engage in commerce, such as the nationally renowned Button Trading Center in Qiaotou Town, Wenzhou City, which is a gathering of 12 categories and over 1,400 varieties of specialized markets. The reason for its thriving trade and enduring prosperity is that it has concentrated over 450 private enterprises and family workshops. Second, after entrepreneurs accumulate a certain amount of capital, they invest to build new townships for further development, such as the 4.26 square kilometer Longgang Town in Wenzhou City, which was built two years ago with an investment of 240 million yuan by numerous private enterprise operators.

The development of private enterprises has promoted the rise and prosperity of townships, and the prosperity of townships will in turn attract more labor and capital, developing new industries.

Due to various historical and current reasons, regions with weak public economic foundations, where commodity economy has developed and there are many skilled traders, large populations, scarce resources, and a relatively suitable "microclimate," private enterprises are also relatively concentrated, even dominating the entire national economy. For example, in Wuchuan County, Guangdong Province, there are 4,210 enterprises with hired workers, including 1,293 private enterprises with 11 or more hired workers. According to incomplete statistics, the output value in 1987 reached 230 million yuan.

　　我国私营企业向集镇集中
    目前，我国的私营企业数量不多，绝大部分分布在农村。而农村私营企业又表现区域集中化的趋势——为了追求更高的经济效益和工作效益，分散在各个村庄的私营企业将逐步向中心集镇或县城集中。中心集镇和县城，是农村社区经济、政治、文化和各种社会活动的中心，同村庄比较，这里生活方便，交通便利，信息灵通，基础设施较好，有利于开展购销业务和各种经济活动，同时，这里的居民文明程度较高，社会经济管理要规范化一些，有更多的安全感、稳定感。私营企业向中心集镇集中有两条途径：一是经营者直接集资雇工兴办企业务工经商，如全国闻名的纽扣交易中心——温州市桥头镇，它是荟萃１２大类１４００多个品种的专业市场，之所以买卖兴隆、经久不衰，根本原因是它集中了４５０多家私营企业和家庭工厂；二是经营者积累了一定资金后，为了进一步发展，而集资兴建新的集镇，如占地４．２６平方公里的温州市龙港镇，就是由众多的私营企业经营者集资２．４亿元于前两年兴建的。私营企业的发展，促进了集镇的兴起、繁荣，而集镇的繁荣，又将聚积更多的劳力、资金，发展新的产业。
    由于历史和现实的种种原因，那些公有经济基础薄弱，商品经济发展以后能工善贾者多，人口众多、资源匮乏，“小气候”比较适宜的地区，私营企业也比较集中，甚至在整个国民经济中占主体地位。如广东省吴川县，雇工企业有４２１０家，其中雇工１１人以上的私营企业有１２９３家，据不完全统计，１９８７年产值达２．３亿元。
