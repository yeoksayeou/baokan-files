Beijing actively explores new ways to organize the market

Establishes supply bases and expands circulation channels

	BEIJING, Jan. 9 (Xinhua) -- Reporters Zhao Xinglin and Ni Xiaolin reported from Beijing: Today, reporters learned from the Beijing Municipal Commerce Work Conference that in 1988, the Beijing Municipal Commerce Commission system actively explored new ways to organize the market. While ensuring the supply of daily necessities for the people of the entire city, efforts were made to organize various types of goods that are in demand, and the market was relatively well arranged and managed. According to statistics at the end of November last year, the total retail sales of social commodities in the city reached 21.28 billion yuan, an increase of 33.6 percent over the previous year.

	The market in the capital in 1988 faced difficulties due to excessive demand. In addition to completing the necessary commodity transportation, the Beijing Municipal Commerce Commission and its subordinate enterprises continued to open their doors wide, extensively cooperated with enterprises and units in various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, introduced factories into stores, organized exhibitions and sales of goods from outside the province, and expanded channels for obtaining goods. According to statistics, the Beijing Municipal Commerce Commission system developed more than 100 new trade alliances with more than 20 provinces and cities across the country in 1988, and invested 169 million yuan to build 48 supply bases for grains, pigs, vegetables, sugar, feed, paper, and other products in more than 10 provinces and cities and more than 40 counties across the country. At present, 14 types of commodities have been established with reserves, coordinated with the financial and banking departments, to enhance the macro-control function.

	In addition, to diversify the organization and arrangement of commodities, the Beijing Municipal Commerce Commission also actively explored ways to develop an outward-looking economy. The total export supply value of the entire system in 1988 reached 145 million yuan, and non-trade foreign exchange income is expected to reach 243 million yuan, an actual increase of 14 percent over the previous year; labor service foreign exchange income was 1.18 million U.S. dollars. At the same time, the entire system also introduced some marketable commodities from abroad through various trading methods to meet the multi-level consumption needs of the people.

　　北京市积极探索组织市场新路子
    建立货源基地　广开流通渠道
    本报讯  本报记者赵兴林、新华社记者倪小林报道：记者今天从北京市商业工作会议上获悉，１９８８年北京市商委系统积极探索组织市场新路子，在保证全市人民生活必需品的供应的同时，努力组织适销对路的各类商品，较好地摆布和安排了市场，据去年１１月底统计，全市社会商品零售额达２１２．８亿元，比上年增长３３．６％。
    １９８８年的首都市场由于需求过旺，商品供应有一定难度。北京市商委和所属企业在认真完成必需的商品调运外，继续敞开店门，广泛与各省、市、自治区企业、单位联合，引厂进店，组织外埠商品展销，广开货源渠道。据统计，市商委系统１９８８年与全国２０多个省市新发展了１００多家贸易联合体，投资１．６９亿元在全国１０多个省、市４０多个县新建粮食、生猪、蔬菜、食糖、饲料、纸张等４８个货源基地。现已经财政、金融等部门协调，有１４种商品建立了储备，以增强宏观调控机能。
    另外，为多样化组织安排商品，北京市商委还积极探索发展外向型经济的路子。全系统１９８８年出口供货总值达１．４５亿人民币，非贸易外汇收入可望达２．４３亿元，比上年实际增长１４％；劳务创汇收入１１８万美元。在此同时，全系统也以多种交易方式从国外引入一些适销商品，满足群众多层次消费的需求。
