Edition: 5

The Shanghai Literary Review began the "Rewriting Literary History" column in its fourth issue of 1988. The column is overseen by Chen Sihe and Wang Xiaoming. In the fourth issue, it published "Reexamining the 'Zhao Shuli Direction'" and "Lessons from the 'Liu Qing Phenomenon.'" In the sixth issue, it published "The Legacy of Hu Feng's Literary Theory" and "Returning to the Middle Ages—Critiquing the Path of Maoyuan's Literary Criticism."

The column's overseers believe that establishing this column aims to stimulate a lively atmosphere in literary criticism and to rekindle interest and enthusiasm in rethinking the past. The editors believe that by revisiting history with a contemporary perspective, one can abstract and summarize some regularities that influence today's and tomorrow's literary creation. This process also provides beneficial new insights for the construction of literary history and literary criticism as academic disciplines, thereby avoiding the recurrence of such regrettable incidents.

专栏：

　　《上海文论》辟《重写文学史》专栏
    《上海文论》１９８８年第４期始开辟《重写文学史》栏。由陈思和、王晓明主持。先后在第４期发表了《关于“赵树理方向”的再认识》、《“柳青现象”的启示》，第６期发表了《胡风文学理论的遗产》、《重返中世纪——姚文元“文艺批评”道路批判》等文。
    主持人认为，开设这个专栏，希望能刺激文学批评气氛的活跃，激起人们重新思考昨天的兴趣和热情。编者认为，用当代的眼光返顾历史，从昨天中抽象归纳出一些对今天乃至明天文学创作发生作用的规律性的东西，同时为文学史和文学批评的学科建设提供一些有益的新东西，避免今后再发生这种令人叹息的事情。
