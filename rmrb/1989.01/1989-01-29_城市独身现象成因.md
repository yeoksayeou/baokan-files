In recent years, the number of individuals aged 30 and above who are unmarried, divorced, or widowed has been increasing in China. In rural areas, these individuals are more prevalent in remote, impoverished, and backward villages, with males being the majority. In cities, they are more common among the high-knowledge class, with females being more numerous. In a certain research institute in Beijing, out of 81 employees aged 30 and above, 14 are single, with 11 females and 3 males. In a certain village in Pengyang County, Ningxia, out of 158 villagers aged 30 and above, 32 are single, all of whom are males. The causes of rural singleness are relatively simple: villages are remote, villagers are poor, males are "permanent," and females are "transient."

The causes of urban singleness are more complex. Some people make hasty decisions after just one meeting, blowing off potential partners; others believe in "the longer you wait, the better it gets," endlessly delaying; still others prefer to remain single rather than "settle." Objectively, these attitudes have led to singleness. According to a sample survey, this group accounts for approximately 42% of urban singles. Those who have experienced setbacks in love and marriage, viewing the realm of marriage and love as a taboo, make up 9% of urban singles.

Traditional feudal ideology also influences people's views on love and marriage. Those who remain single because they cannot find a partner with an equal or higher educational background account for 18%, with 17% being females. Due to the influence of political movements and political trends, approximately 14% of singles remain so. Those who went to the countryside and became older singles account for 8% of urban singles.

Additionally, a small number of individuals remain single due to the influence of traditional Chinese culture and religious thought, adhering to the ascetic rules of religion. Recently, Nanjing's Jīmíng Temple received 342 letters from 278 young women in 25 provinces and cities expressing their desire to become nuns.

　　城市独身现象成因
    几年来我国３０岁以上未婚独身、离婚独身和丧偶独身的越来越多。独身者在农村，偏僻贫穷落后的山村较多，男性为绝对多数；在城市，高知识阶层较多，女性较多。北京市某研究所工作人员中３０岁以上的有８１人，独身者１４人，女性１１人，男性３人。宁夏彭阳县某山村，３０岁以上的村民１５８人，其中独身者达３２人，皆为男性。农村独身现象的成因比较简单，无非是村庄偏僻，村民贫困，男的是“永久牌”，女的是“飞鸽牌”。
    城市独身现象的成因较为复杂，有的一次见面就盖棺论定，很轻率地吹了；相信“久等必有一好”，无限制地拖下去；宁为独身，也不“凑合”，等等，客观上形成了独身。据抽样调查，这部分人约占城市独身者的４２％。因恋爱和婚姻曾经受到挫折，将婚姻恋爱领域视为畏途、禁区的占城市独身者的９％。
    传统的封建意识也影响着人们的恋爱婚姻观。由于找不到学历相当或更高的异性而独身的均占１８％，其中１７％为女性。由于政治运动和政治思潮的影响，造成的独身者约占独身者的１４％。上山下乡，拖为大龄的占城市独身者的８％。
    此外，尚有少数人系受中国传统文化、宗教思想的影响，受宗教的禁欲主义的成规的影响才独身的。南京鸡鸣寺近来收到２５个省市２７８名女青年３４２封要求出家的信。　　　　　　（《社会》１９８８年第１２期　杜幼德文）
