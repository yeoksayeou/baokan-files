The World Badminton Championships will commence today at the Elizabeth Stadium in Hong Kong. After 19 rounds of competition in the 1988 World Badminton Tour, the top 14 men's singles players, top 10 women's singles players, and top 6 men's doubles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles players have qualified for this final tournament. With so many strong competitors, a fierce battle is anticipated.

The Chinese team has a powerful lineup, including Zhao Jianhua, Xiong Guobao, Li Lingwei, Han Aiping, Li Yongbo, Tian Bingyi, Lin Ying, and Guan Weizhen. They will compete in the men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles events.

Zhao Jianhua, who won the Thomas Cup in Kuala Lumpur last year, has been placed in Group D, where the competition is particularly intense. He expressed confidence in his current form. Xiong Guobao, the 1987 World Championships winner, said that if he advances, he might face Indonesia's Sugiarto in the semifinals, which would be a very tough match. If he reaches the finals, his potential opponents could be Zhao Jianhua or Denmark's Frost. Li Lingwei believes she has a 50% chance of defending her women's singles title. She anticipates facing South Korea's Lee Young-sook in the semifinals, but Li Lingwei has a winning record against her, giving her a slight advantage. The men's doubles pair, Li Yongbo and Tian Bingyi, think they have a chance to win if they play to their potential. Their likely opponents could be Malaysia's Jalani Sidek and Razif Sidek.

International Badminton Federation Chairman Palmer, who is in Hong Kong to watch the matches, revealed that starting from June this year, the international federation will implement a computer ranking system to determine the seeding of players and to select athletes for the 1992 Olympics.

　　世界羽毛球总决赛今日开战
    中国选手有信心迎接苦斗
    本报香港１月３日电  记者连锦添报道：世界羽毛球总决赛４日在香港伊丽莎伯体育馆开锣。１９８８年世界羽毛球巡回赛，经过１９站的比赛后，男子单打排名前１４名、女子单打排名前１０名、男女双打及混合双打排名前６名的世界羽坛好手获得参加这次总决赛资格。各路强手云集，预料有一番恶斗。
    中国队参赛阵容强大，包括赵剑华、熊国宝、李玲蔚、韩爱平、李永波、田秉毅、林瑛、关渭贞等名将，他们将分别角逐男单、女单、男双、女双和混双项目的奖牌。
    去年在吉隆坡赢得汤姆斯杯冠军的中国选手赵剑华，被编到竞争对手特别强的Ｄ组。他表示自己近况不错，看来信心颇强。１９８７年总决赛冠军熊国宝表示，自己如能出线，估计半决赛会碰上印尼的苏吉亚托，此仗将非常难打。如果顺利打进决赛，竞争对手可能是赵剑华或丹麦的弗罗斯特。李玲蔚自言蝉联女单冠军机会有五成，估计自己在四强阶段比赛中，会遇到南朝鲜李英淑的威胁。不过，李玲蔚去年有两胜对手的纪录，形势稍占上风。男双选手李永波、田秉毅认为，如能发挥水平，夺标有希望，对手可能是马来西亚的贾拉尼·西德克和拉吉夫·西德克。
    前来香港观赛的国际羽联主席帕尔默透露，从今年６月开始，国际羽联将增设电脑排名制度，以便决定种子选手次序，并且用作选拔球员参加１９９２年奥运会之用。
