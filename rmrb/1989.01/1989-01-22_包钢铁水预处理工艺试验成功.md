Baotou Steel's Iron Pre-treatment Process Trial Successful

	Baotou Steel's iron with medium phosphorus content has been a unique challenge globally. Previously, this iron was directly processed in the converter, leading to issues such as prolonged smelting times, high consumption of various raw materials, and low furnace operation rates. By the end of December 1988, with the successful trial of the iron pre-treatment process, a national key project under the State Science and Technology Commission, a solution to this resource-wasting problem has been found.

	Baotou Steel primarily uses medium phosphorus ores, which cannot be processed like ordinary iron with phosphorus content below 0.2% to produce high-quality steel, nor can they be processed like high phosphorus iron with phosphorus content above 1% in the furnace. This dilemma has puzzled metallurgists both domestically and internationally.

	Since 1982, the Ministry of Metallurgy has organized specialized teams to tackle this issue, and the research has been included in the State Science and Technology Commission's "Sixth Five-Year Plan" key projects. Currently, Baotou Steel uses only 11 kilograms of natural soda or 27 kilograms of lime to remove 0.1% of phosphorus from each ton of medium phosphorus iron, reducing the phosphorus content to less than 0.1% and the sulfur content to less than 0.01%. The consumption of powdered reagents has reached or is close to the levels reported internationally. After treating the iron, Baotou Steel uses the converter to smelt steel, reducing the average smelting time per furnace by 4-8 minutes compared to before. The comprehensive slag consumption per ton of steel is about one-third of that for smelting medium phosphorus iron. The consumption of steel and iron materials is reduced by 34 kilograms, lime consumption is reduced by 92 kilograms, and the cost of steel is lowered by about 14 yuan.

　　包钢铁水预处理工艺试验成功
    本报讯  举世独有的包钢中磷铁水，过去直接进入转炉炼钢，存在冶炼时间长、各种原材料消耗高、炉子作业率低的问题，１９８８年１２月底，随着国家科委技术攻关项目——包钢铁水预处理试验通过部级鉴定，为解决这种资源浪费现象开通了途径。
    包钢使用的矿石多为中磷矿石，既不能像磷含量０．２％以下的普通铁水那样正常冶炼优质钢，又不能像磷含量１％以上的高磷铁水那样炉内炼钢，曾令国内外冶金界人士搔头叹无计。
    从１９８２年起，冶金部组织专门力量攻关，此项研究并被列入国家科委“六五”攻关课题。现在，包钢只用１１公斤天然碱或２７公斤石灰，就可以在每吨中磷铁水中脱去０．１％的磷，使磷含量小于０．１％，硫含量小于０．０１，粉剂消耗量达到或接近国外报道水平。包钢采用处理后的铁水经转炉炼钢，每炉钢平均冶炼时间比原来缩短４—８分钟，每吨钢的综合渣料约为中磷铁水炼钢的１／３，钢铁料消耗下降３４公斤，石灰消耗减少９２公斤，钢的成本降低１４元左右。
