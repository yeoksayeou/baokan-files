The 10th Bremen International Women's Volleyball Tournament held its semifinals today. China's second team fought hard in five sets but ultimately lost 2-3 to the Soviet team, missing the chance to compete for the championship.

The Soviet team participating in this tournament includes six members of the Olympic champion team and has a strong lineup. China's second team, on the other hand, has only been formed for about half a year, with young players who showed great tenacity on the court. Today's match, China's second team lost the first two sets 5-15 and 13-15. Despite the disadvantage, the players did not give up. They fought back with scores of 15-10 and 15-13 to tie the match. In the decisive fifth set, the Chinese women's volleyball team ultimately fell short due to lack of experience and slightly weaker strength, losing 12-15.

In another semifinal match held today, Cuba defeated East Germany 3-0. Tomorrow, Cuba will face the Soviet team to compete for the championship of this tournament. China's team will play against another European powerhouse, East Germany, to vie for the third place.

　　我女排新秀２∶３负于苏联队
    新华社波恩１月７日电  （记者胡旭东）第１０届不来梅国际女排赛今天进行了半决赛，中国二队苦战５局，最后以２∶３负于苏联队，失去了争夺冠军的机会。
    参加本届比赛的苏联队中有６名奥运会冠军队成员，实力雄厚；而中国二队组队才半年多，队员年纪轻，但她们在场上表现得十分顽强。今天的比赛，中国二队先以５∶１５和１３∶１５连失两局，在不利情况下，队员们没有气馁，她们急起直追，以１５∶１０和１５∶１３扳回两局。在决胜局中，中国女排二队终因经验不足，实力稍逊，以１２∶１５失利。
    在今天举行的另一场半决赛中，古巴队以３∶０轻取民主德国队。明天，古巴队将和苏联队争夺本届比赛的冠军。中国队将再战欧洲劲旅民主德国队，争夺比赛的第三名。
