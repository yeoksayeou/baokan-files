To contribute to easing the supply-demand contradiction in the domestic market, the Xining Railway Bureau last year transported nearly 100 million tons of Qinghai salt out of the region.

Reporters Zhang Shusheng and Liu Juncai of the People's Railway Daily reported: The Xining Railway Bureau of the Lanzhou Railway Administration overcame difficulties such as insufficient transport capacity and low freight rates. They ensured the steady supply of salt, which is urgently needed for the national economy, to 23 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions. Statistics show that this railway bureau transported 970,000 tons of edible and industrial salt from Qinghai last year, exceeding the annual plan by 94%, and made a significant contribution to easing the supply-demand contradiction in the domestic market.

Salt is a unique resource advantage of Qinghai Province. The export income from Qinghai salt accounts for a considerable proportion of the province's fiscal revenue. Due to the remote and desolate location of the production area, the railway department used to incur a loss of 10.68 yuan for every ton of salt transported out. However, this railway bureau, with the overall situation in mind, prioritized national interests and social benefits, and spared no effort to overcome difficulties and organize the transportation of salt out of the region.

With the strong support of the Xining Railway Bureau, Qinghai Province averages the export of 2,870,000 kilograms of salt per day.

　　为缓解国内市场供需矛盾作贡献
    西宁铁路分局去年外运青盐近百万吨
    本报讯  记者张述圣、人民铁道报记者刘俊才报道：兰州铁路局西宁铁路分局克服运力不足、运价低廉等不利因素，把国民经济急需的青盐，源源不断地向东运往２３个省、市、自治区。据统计，这个铁路分局去年从青海运出食用盐和工业用盐９７万吨，超年计划的９４％，为缓解国内市场供需矛盾作出了贡献。
    原盐是青海省得天独厚的资源优势，青盐外销收入，在该省财政中占有相当大的比重。由于产地偏远荒僻，过去每外运一吨青盐，铁路部门亏损１０．６８元。但这个铁路分局以大局为重，把国家利益和社会效益放在第一位，想方设法克服困难，组织原盐外运。
    由于西宁铁路分局的大力配合，青海省平均每天外销２８７万公斤盐。
