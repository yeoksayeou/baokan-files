The banks have been promoting preservation savings for several months now. Some people have enthusiastically participated, while others have adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Still, others believe that participating in preservation savings is still a loss and that it is better to store goods. The emergence of different opinions is due to the public's lack of understanding of this new savings method. Here, a colleague from the People's Bank of China answers some of the main questions raised by the public.

Some readers are confused about why the subsidy rate for the first quarter of this year is so different from that of the fourth quarter of last year?

The subsidy rate is calculated based on price changes. Prices fluctuate constantly, and the state publishes the figures quarterly. Therefore, the subsidy rate also changes accordingly. For example, the price index published by the state (with 1987 Q4 as 100) was 108.3 for the first quarter of 1988, 112.9 for the second quarter, and 122.3 for the third quarter. The price increase in the third quarter was much higher than in the second quarter, so the subsidy rate for the first quarter of this year (16.13%) is significantly higher than that of the fourth quarter of last year (7.28%).

In a situation where the price increase is certain, an increase in the interest rate will result in a corresponding decrease in the subsidy rate. The People's Bank of China adjusted the deposit and loan interest rates starting from February 1, 1989. The interest rate for a three-year term deposit was adjusted from 9.72% to 13.14%, and the subsidy rate was correspondingly reduced from 16.13% to 12.71%. The benefits of residents participating in preservation savings remain unchanged.

Some people think that with such a high subsidy rate, storing money now will definitely be profitable when it is withdrawn. They even take out fixed-term deposits and store them again. In fact, this is incorrect. Because the normal interest income does not change, the amount of the subsidy depends on the price change situation when the deposit matures, that is, the preservation subsidy rate at the time of deposit maturity, not the subsidy rate at the time of deposit. If the price rises rapidly during the deposit period, the subsidy obtained will be more; otherwise, it will be less. If the price increase during the deposit period is lower than the deposit interest rate, then the deposit can increase a part of the interest on the basis of preserving the principal.

The preservation subsidy rate is announced before the quarter begins. Since the current quarter has not yet ended when the announcement is made, the previous quarter's index must be referenced for calculation. For the depositor, both the price index at the time of deposit and the price index at the time of withdrawal are calculated based on the previous quarter's index, and there is no disadvantage in terms of time. The amount of his benefit is determined by the price increase.

Finally, it should be noted that preservation savings, as a new savings method, still have many aspects that need to be improved. For example, many people ask why one-year term deposits are not preserved; why bonds with greater risk are not preserved, etc. Many opinions are very pertinent, reflecting everyone's common desire to rationalize interest rate relationships. We believe that with the deepening of the reform, these problems will be solved.

### 再谈保值储蓄

　　再谈保值储蓄
    银行开展保值储蓄已经几个月了，一些人踊跃参加，一些人持观望态度，一些人认为参加保值储蓄还是吃亏，不如存物好。出现不同想法是由于群众对这一新的吸储形式还不十分了解。在这里，由中国人民银行的同志针对群众提出的主要问题作些解答。　　　　　　　　　　　
　　　　　　　　　　　　——编者　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    有些读者感到迷惑不解，今年一季度与去年四季度的贴补率为什么悬殊这么大？
    贴补率是根据物价变动推算出来的，物价随时变动，国家按季公布，贴补率相应有所不同。如国家公布的物价指数（以１９８７年四季度为１００），１９８８年一季度为１０８．３，二季度为１１２．９，三季度为１２２．３，三季度的物价上升幅度大大高于二季度的物价上升幅度，因而今年一季度的贴补率（１６．１３％）也就明显高于去年四季度的贴补率（７．２８％）。
    在物价上升幅度一定的情况下，利率上升，则贴补率相应降低。中国人民银行从今年２月１日起调整存贷款利率，三年期存款从９．７２％调到１３．１４％，贴补率随之由１６．１３％降为１２．７１％，居民参加保值储蓄的收益不变。
    有人以为贴补率这样高，这时存款，将来取时一定上算，还把定期储蓄取出再重新存上。其实这就错了。因为正常的利息收入是不变的，补贴的多少要看存款到期时与存款存入时的物价变动情况，即存款到期时的保值贴补率，而不是看存入款时的保值贴补率。如果存款期内物价上升很快，所得的补贴就多；反之就少；如果存款期内物价上升幅度低于存款利率，则存款能在保本的基础上增值一部分，即利息。
    保值贴补率是在季前公布的，由于公布时当季尚未期满，因此必须参照隔季指数计算。对储户来说，存款时与取款时的物价指数都是根据隔季指数计算出来的，在时间上并不吃亏，他的收益的多少是由物价的上升幅度来决定的。
    最后要说明的是，保值储蓄作为一种新的吸储形式，还有许多方面尚待完善。比如很多人提出，为什么一年期储蓄不予保值；为什么债券风险更大不予保值等等。许多意见都很中肯，表明了大家要求理顺利率关系的共同愿望。我们相信，随着改革的深入，这些问题都会得到解决。
