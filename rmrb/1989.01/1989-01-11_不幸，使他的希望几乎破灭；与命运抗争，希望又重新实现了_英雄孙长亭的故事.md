Those who have read "How the Steel Was Tempered" all say he is like Paul; those who know the story of Zhang Haidi say he is like Haidi.

He is the first-class merit winner and second-class combat hero, Sun Changting.

Sun Changting, now 23 years old, had a carefree childhood. As a child, he loved playing soccer and was a member of the Tianjin Nankai District Sports School soccer team. He and the current national soccer team member Xie Yuxin were both named the best scorers in the national "Sprout Cup" soccer tournament twice. In 1983, he was specially recruited into the military soccer team.

In the summer of 1984, the battle at the Laoshan front line flared up again. During the attack on the 140-meter high ground, 6 out of the 8 soldiers in Sun Changting's spearhead squad were killed! Old and new grievances ignited Sun Changting's fierce anger. He leaped up, charging through the hail of bullets and shells, blowing up the enemy's fortress, and clearing the path for the advancing troops. After the battle, Sun Changting was awarded a first-class merit and named a second-class combat hero.

Sun Changting is truly a hero. It was during that battle that his left leg was blown apart by an enemy landmine, and the remaining comrade also sacrificed his life. He dragged his severely injured left leg back to the unit alone. In the hospital, he underwent 6 major surgeries, and his left leg was amputated halfway. He did not shed a single tear. However, when Sun Changting thought about having to give up his soccer career due to the loss of his left leg, he couldn't help but cry silently. After all, since the age of 7, Sun Changting had been inseparable from soccer. After more than a decade, how could one not be sad to part ways? But a soldier is a soldier. Sun Changting did not yield to fate. He told his soccer teammates, "I have some foundation in track and field, so if I can't play soccer, I'll switch to being a track and field athlete." Fortunately, in 1986, Sun Changting was transferred to the Tianjin Nankai District Sports Commission. There, he diligently performed his duties while taking advantage of the commission's facilities to train intensively.

The difficulties were greater than expected. Some people saw Sun Changting training with one leg, running, jumping, and throwing the javelin, and they didn't understand, saying things like, "Missing an arm or a leg, and still training!" Sun Changting didn't pay attention to these rumors because he remembered Dante's words: "Follow your own path, let others talk!" Running with a prosthetic leg, one leg heavy and the other light, it was hard to maintain balance. At the beginning, he would fall flat on his face, bruising his nose and face. The junction between his left leg and the prosthetic would often rub raw, bleeding profusely; in winter, it would freeze and crack, causing intense pain. But Sun Changting trained even harder the more it hurt.

The harvest time came. In August 1987, at the Tangshan Second National Disabled Games, Sun Changting reaped a bumper harvest: he won the gold medal in the men's A4 level javelin competition, the crown in the 200-meter run, and the champion's throne in the long jump. Last October, at the Seoul Eighth International Paralympic Games, Sun Changting continued to bring good news: he narrowly missed the silver medal in the men's A4 level long jump by 1 centimeter. Then, he worked with his teammates to win two second-place finishes in the men's A4 level 4x100 meter and 4x400 meter relay races. When it came time for the men's A4 level javelin competition, Sun Changting's left leg, which had been rubbed raw in the previous days' competitions, had swollen so much that he couldn't even put on his prosthetic. Even after spraying a cooling agent, he still couldn't put it on. Sun Changting was desperate. He gritted his teeth and forced his left leg into the prosthetic, then went onto the competition field, managing to win a hard-earned bronze medal for the Chinese team.

Misfortune nearly shattered Sun Changting's hopes; fighting against fate, his hopes were realized again. People are happy for him and congratulate him, but he has already set his sights on 1992—Barcelona, Spain—the Ninth International Paralympic Games.

　　不幸，使他的希望几乎破灭；与命运抗争，希望又重新实现了——
    英雄孙长亭的故事
    贾昭全
    看过《钢铁是怎样炼成的》的人，都说他像保尔；知道张海迪事迹的人，又说他像海迪。
    他，就是一等功臣、二级战斗英雄孙长亭。
    今年２３岁的孙长亭有过天真的童年。小时候，他爱踢足球，是天津市南开区体校足球队的小队员，曾和现在国家足球队的谢育新一起，两次被评为全国“萌芽杯”足球赛的最佳射手。１９８３年，他被特招到部队足球队。
    １９８４年夏天，老山前线战火又起。在攻打一四○高地时，孙长亭所在的尖刀班８名战士就牺牲了６名！新仇旧恨，点燃了孙长亭的满腔怒火。他一跃而起，冒着枪林弹雨冲上去，把敌人的碉堡炸开了花，为后续部队扫平了前进的道路。战斗结束，孙长亭立了一等功，被评为二级战斗英雄。
    孙长亭不愧是英雄。就在那次战斗中，他的左腿被敌人的地雷炸得血肉横飞，剩下的那位战友也牺牲了，他拖着重伤的左腿，独自爬回了部队。在医院里，他动了６次大手术，左腿被截去了一半，他没有掉一滴泪。可是，孙长亭想到因失去左腿要告别足球生涯时，不禁暗暗地哭了。是呀，从７岁起就与足球为伴的孙长亭，十几年来已经与足球结下了不解之缘。一旦分别，怎不令人难过呢。但是，战士终归是战士。孙长亭没有向命运低头。他对足球队的战友们说：“在田径方面，我还有些基础，不能踢足球，就改行当田径运动员。”正好，１９８６年，孙长亭转业到了天津市南开区体委。在这里，他一面尽职尽责地做好保卫工作，一面利用体委的有利条件抓紧进行训练。
    困难比预想的还大。有人见孙长亭拖着一条腿练跑步，练跳远，练标枪，很不理解，说什么“缺胳膊少腿的，还练嘛！”这些风言风语，孙长亭没放在心上，因为他的心里记着但丁的名言：“走自己的路，让人家去说吧！”穿着假肢练跑步，一条腿重，一条腿轻，很难掌握平衡，开始一跑一个跟头，摔得鼻青脸肿的。左腿与假肢的结合部，又常常磨破皮，流血不止；冬天还冻得裂起血口子，疼痛钻心。可是，孙长亭越疼越练。
    收获的时候到了。１９８７年８月，在唐山第二届全国伤残人运动会上，孙长亭硕果累累：他夺得了Ａ４级男子标枪比赛的金牌，摘下了２００米跑的桂冠，登上了跳远冠军的宝座。去年１０月，在汉城第八届国际伤残人奥运会上，孙长亭又捷报频传：他先以１厘米之差屈居Ａ４级男子跳远的亚军。接着，又与队友同心协力，夺得了Ａ４级男子４×１００米和４×４００米接力赛两个第二名。等到进行Ａ４级男子标枪比赛时，孙长亭在前几天比赛中就磨破皮的左腿由于感染，已经肿得连假肢也穿不上了。喷了冷却剂，还是穿不上。孙长亭急了。他咬着牙，把左腿往假肢里使劲一塞，就上了比赛场，结果硬是为中国队拚来了一枚来之不易的铜牌。
    不幸，使孙长亭的希望几乎破灭；与命运抗争，他的希望又重新实现了。人们为他高兴，向他祝贺，他又把目光投向了１９９２年——西班牙巴塞罗那——第九届国际伤残人奥运会。
