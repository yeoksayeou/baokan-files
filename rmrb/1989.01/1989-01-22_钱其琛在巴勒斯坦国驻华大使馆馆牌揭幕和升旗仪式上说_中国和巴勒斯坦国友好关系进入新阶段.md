	New China News Agency, Beijing, January 21 (Reporter Yang Guoqiang): Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said today that the friendly relations between China and the State of Palestine, and between the Chinese and Palestinian peoples, have entered a new stage.

	At today's unveiling ceremony of the plaque and flag-raising ceremony for the Palestinian Embassy in China, Qian Qichen, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, extended sincere congratulations to Chairman Arafat and the PLO Executive Committee, as well as the Palestinian people.

	Qian Qichen said, "The birth of the State of Palestine is the fruit of the long and heroic struggle of the Palestinian people. It marks the beginning of a new historical period for the Palestinian revolution."

	He pointed out that at the 19th special session of the Palestinian National Council held in Algiers last November, various factions of the PLO united, through friendly consultations and seeking common ground while reserving differences, made realistic and historically significant major decisions, demonstrating the PLO's sincerity in seeking a political solution to the Palestinian issue.

	Qian Qichen said, the Chinese government highly appreciates the positive actions taken by the PLO to seek a peaceful resolution to the Middle East issue. China hopes that the Israeli authorities will follow the current trend of easing international tensions and respond positively to the proactive measures taken by the Palestinian side.

	He reiterated that the Chinese government and people have always been concerned about, sympathized with, and supported the just struggle of the Palestinian and Arab peoples. China will, as always, firmly support the just struggle of the Palestinian people and make positive efforts to achieve an early peaceful resolution to the Middle East issue.

	Palestinian Ambassador to China, Yusuf Rajib, in his speech, thanked the Communist Party of China, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people for their support, and introduced the course of the Palestinian revolution.

	He said, "Today, you are again celebrating this great day with us, which shows that you continue to uphold the principle of supporting the Arab national cause, primarily the central Arab cause—the Palestinian cause, and supporting the struggle of all peoples of the world for freedom, independence, development, and progress."

	Relevant officials from China and ambassadors from some Arab countries stationed in China also attended the unveiling and flag-raising ceremony.

	China recognized the State of Palestine on November 20 last year and, on January 7 this year, agreed in a reply to the PLO that the PLO office in Beijing would be upgraded to the Palestinian Embassy in China as of December 31, 1988.

　　钱其琛在巴勒斯坦国驻华大使馆馆牌揭幕和升旗仪式上说       
    中国和巴勒斯坦国友好关系进入新阶段
    新华社北京１月２１日电（记者杨国强）外交部部长钱其琛今天在这里说，中国和巴勒斯坦国、中国人民和巴勒斯坦人民之间的友好关系进入了一个新阶段。
    在今天举行的巴勒斯坦国驻华大使馆馆牌揭幕和升旗仪式上，钱其琛代表中国政府和中国人民向以阿拉法特主席为首的巴解执委会和巴勒斯坦人民表示衷心的祝贺。
    钱其琛说，“巴勒斯坦国的诞生，是巴勒斯坦人民长期英勇斗争的胜利成果，它标志着巴勒斯坦革命事业进入了一个新的历史时期。”
    他指出，去年１１月在阿尔及尔召开的巴勒斯坦全国委员会第１９次特别会议上，巴解组织各派团结一致，通过友好协商、求同存异作出了现实的、有历史意义的重大决定，体现了巴解组织谋求政治解决巴勒斯坦问题的诚意。
    钱其琛说，中国政府高度评价巴解组织为谋求中东问题和平解决所采取的积极行动。中国希望以色列当局能顺应当前国际形势趋于缓和的潮流，对巴勒斯坦方面的主动行动作出积极的反应。
    他重申，中国政府和中国人民一贯关心、同情和支持巴勒斯坦人民和阿拉伯人民的正义斗争，中国将一如既往，坚决支持巴勒斯坦人民的正义斗争，并为早日实现中东问题的和平解决作出积极努力。
    巴勒斯坦国驻华大使尤素夫·拉吉布在致辞中对中国共产党、中国政府和中国人民的支持表示感谢，并介绍了巴勒斯坦革命的斗争历程。
    他说，“今天，你们又与我们共同庆祝这一伟大的日子，这体现了你们继续执行支持阿拉伯民族事业、首先是阿拉伯的中心事业——巴勒斯坦事业，支持全世界各国人民为争取自由、独立、发展、进步的事业这一既定的原则立场。”
    中国有关方面负责人以及一些阿拉伯国家驻华使节也出席了揭幕和升旗仪式。
    中国是去年１１月２０日承认巴勒斯坦国的，并于今年１月７日复照巴解组织同意巴解组织驻京办事处从１９８８年１２月３１日起改为巴勒斯坦驻华大使馆。
