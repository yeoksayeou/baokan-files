	No Feasts, No Gifts, No Sightseeing
	Pre-Allocation Ordering Conference: A Breeze of Integrity Sweeps Through

	The People's Daily and China Materials News reporters report: Over the past three months, the Ministry of Materials has consecutively held pre-allocation ordering conferences for 1989's first half of the year for 14 types of materials, including non-ferrous metals, steel, chemicals, cables, electromechanical equipment, agricultural machinery, machine tools, automobiles, timber, pyrotechnics, building materials, light industry, coal, and foreign aid. Due to strengthened supervision and strict discipline, the ordering conferences this year have been better than in previous years.

	Before the conferences, the leaders of the Supervision Department convened a meeting with the heads of the supervision bureaus of the Ministry of Materials and other relevant departments. They also formed eight supervision teams, each led by a bureau-level cadre, to work on-site during the conferences. The Ministry of Materials and the Supervision Department jointly formulated the "Integrity Measures for the National Materials Ordering and Trading Conference."

	The improvement in the conference atmosphere is evident in the following ways:

	No Feasts. In the past, during ordering conferences, the supply side, demand side, and hosts would frequently treat each other to meals. Often, the food prepared for the conference would go uneaten, while restaurants in the city would be full of guests. This time, the conference organizers did not host banquets, and the meal standards were unified.

	No Gifts. In the past, during ordering conferences, hosts would often give local specialties, and the demand side would compete to give gifts, leading to a never-ending cycle of gift-giving and increasing standards. This time, such practices were prohibited.

	No Sightseeing. The organizers in Yantai said, "In the past, during ordering conferences, representatives would often go sightseeing. This time, no public vehicles were used to send people on tours."

	High Efficiency. In the past, supply-side representatives would often be taken on tours and feasts, making it difficult for the demand side to discuss business. This time, all personnel were required to stay on-site, and business was conducted as soon as they arrived, smoothly signing various pre-allocation ordering contracts.

### 不吃请　不送礼　不游玩  物资预拨订货会  廉洁之风扑面来

　　不吃请　不送礼　不游玩    
    物资预拨订货会  廉洁之风扑面来
    本报讯  《中国物资报》记者和本报记者报道：近３个月以来，物资部相继召开了１９８９年上半年全国有色金属、钢材、化工、电缆、机电、农机、机床、汽车、木材、火工、建材、轻工、煤炭、援外等１４种物资预拨订货会议，由于加强了监督检查，严明了纪律，订货会开得比往年好。
    会前监察部领导召集物资部等有关部监察局长会议，并组成８个由局级干部负责的监察组驻会进行工作。物资部、监察部会前还联合制定了《全国物资订货交易会廉洁措施》。
    订货会会风好转表现在：
    不吃请。以往订货会，供方、需方、东道主之间来回请客，经常是会议准备的饭菜没人吃，大街小巷的饭馆“高朋满座”，各路代表忙着应酬。这次订货会办会单位不宴请，统一伙食标准。
    不送礼。过去订货会上，常常是东道主送特产；需方为了订货，争相送礼，互相攀比，标准越来越高。这次订货会杜绝了这种现象。
    不游山玩水。烟台办会的同志说：“以往每逢订货会，代表四处游玩，这次订货会没用公车送人游览。”
    效率高。以前订货会上，供方代表常常被拉去游山玩水，吃吃喝喝，需方谈业务常常找不到人。这次订货会，人员一律在位，随到随办，顺利地签订了各种物资的预拨订货合同。
