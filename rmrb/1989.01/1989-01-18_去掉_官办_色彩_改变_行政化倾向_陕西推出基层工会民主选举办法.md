The Shaanxi Province promotes democratic election methods for grassroots trade unions

    XEYAN, Jan. 17 (Xinhua) -- "The methods and procedures for nominating candidates for grassroots trade union committee members, standing committee members, and their chairpersons and vice-chairpersons adhere to the principles of bottom-up and top-down coordination; candidates must meet directly with members or member representatives; universal differential elections are implemented, and the election results are reported to higher-level trade unions for approval." The Shaanxi Provincial Federation of Trade Unions' Eighth Plenary Session of the Second Session recently approved the "Temporary Measures for Democratic Elections of Grassroots Trade Union Committees," aiming to establish and gradually improve the democratic election system for grassroots trade union leaders, especially those in the grassroots trade unions, and to use this as a breakthrough to promote the massification and democratization of grassroots trade unions.

    In late August last year, during the election of the Eighth Session of the Shaanxi Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the main leaders of the Shaanxi Provincial Federation of Trade Unions recommended by the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee, including one chairman and three vice-chairmen, were all elected as committee members and standing committee members through two rounds of differential elections and then confirmed by the entire committee. Xue Zhaofeng, who was re-elected as the chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, once told the reporter: "The method of democratic election of trade union leaders is our proposal and was passed by the conference. If I am voted down, I have no regrets. Whether I can be elected or not should be a manifestation and victory of socialist democracy." The election methods determined by the Shaanxi Provincial Federation of Trade Unions this time also provide detailed organizational procedures for how to make a decision to remove from office when, during the term of office of the chairpersons and vice-chairpersons of the grassroots trade unions, one-third or more of the members or member representatives or grassroots trade union committee members jointly propose a motion to remove from office.

　　去掉“官办”色彩　改变“行政化倾向”
    陕西推出基层工会民主选举办法
    本报西安１月１７日电  记者景险峰报道：“基层工会委员会委员、常委及其正副主席候选人的提名办法和程序，坚持自下而上，上下结合；候选人要直接与会员或会员代表见面；普遍实行差额选举，选举结果报上级工会批准。”陕西省总工会八届二次全体委员会日前批准通过的《基层工会委员会民主选举工作暂行办法》，旨在建立和逐步完善基层工会特别是工会领导人的民主选举制度，并以此为突破口推进基层工会的群众化、民主化建设。
    去年８月下旬陕西省总工会八届委员会换届选举时，陕西省委推荐的省总工会主要负责人，包括１名主席和３名副主席，都是通过２次差额选举，当选为委员和常委之后，才由全体委员选举确定的。连选连任省总工会主席的薛昭鋆曾告诉记者：“民主选举工会领导人的办法是我们提议并经大会通过的。如果被刷下来，我毫无后悔之意。自己能否当选，应该说都是社会主义民主的体现和胜利。”陕西省总工会这次确定的选举办法还对基层工会正副主席任职期间确实不称职，有１／３以上会员或会员代表或基层工会委员会委员联名提出罢免要求时，如何作出罢免决定，从组织工作程序上作了详细规定。
