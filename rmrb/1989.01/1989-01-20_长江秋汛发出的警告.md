The unprecedented autumn floods on the Yangtze River have already flowed into the East China Sea. The ecological problems of the Yangtze River raised by this flood are still buzzing on both sides of the river, lingering and not dissipating.

	Water volume is not large, why is the disaster severe?

The rare autumn waters of the Yangtze River, in terms of water volume, are still considered small floods. Although the water volume is not large, the water level is high, and the danger is severe. The relevant national departments originally planned to list "two rivers and one lake" (floods in Zhejiang and Heilongjiang and drought in Hubei) as provinces severely affected by water and drought. When this autumn water came, it washed out another area of Dongting Lake, turning "two rivers and one lake" into "two rivers and two lakes." Many dikes in the Dongting Lake area of Hunan collapsed, and 470,000 mu of farmland were flooded; 650,000 mu of farmland in Hubei Province were affected by the flood, with 470,000 mu basically unharvested. The water level in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River exceeded the warning water level by about 2 meters for a long time. The flood water level at Wuhan reached 27.90 meters, the highest since records began 123 years ago.

The Yangtze River is not in the main flood season, but a rare autumn flood has occurred; the flood is not large, but the losses are heavy. Is this nature's punishment for human deforestation and ecological destruction?

People have different opinions, but the facts are recognized. The Yangtze River has lost the protection of forests and is exposed to wind and rain erosion. "Three days of scorching sun and the crops wither, half a day of heavy rain and the mountain torrents come," severely disrupting normal production and living order. This has led to some students from Hubei studying in Beijing and Shanghai, who had just received drought relief, to start applying for flood relief.

	Floods wash away the "rice bowls"

The Yangtze River carries silt, filling the ancient marshes of Yunmeng, creating the fertile plains of the two lakes and the Yangtze River Delta. The Yangtze River's outstanding contributions to humanity are now turning into serious threats. Today, the Yangtze River is still depositing silt into the lakes on both sides. "The province of a thousand lakes," Hubei, has seen 80% of its lakes disappear, and once the largest freshwater lake in the country—Dongting Lake—is shrinking day by day, ranking second.

Over the past 30 years, water and soil erosion in the Yangtze River basin has been increasing. Floods continuously erode the thin soil layers upstream. The entire basin of 1.8 million square kilometers has seen the area of water and soil erosion increase from 360,000 square kilometers to more than 560,000 square kilometers, with an annual soil erosion amount of more than 2.2 billion tons. Silt rolls into rivers and lakes.

Water and soil erosion in the Yangtze River is threatening the "rice bowls" upstream. The average soil layer thickness in the mountainous areas upstream is 30 to 50 centimeters. Calculating based on the severe erosion rate, in 30 to 50 years, the soil on the mountains will all flow into the rivers. Now, some residents in Yunxi County, Hubei, have no land to farm and are forced to migrate to other places; in Qingzhen and Hezhang counties, Guizhou, 5,000 mu of land lose their soil layers and become "petrified" every year. Without soil, where will people live?

The soil on both banks of the Bailong River upstream of the Yangtze River is peeled off by the flood and deposited near the riverbed in Wudu County in the middle reaches of the river. The rate of riverbed elevation has increased from 4 centimeters per year 40 years ago to 12.5 centimeters in 1988. Now, outside Wudu City, the riverbed is 18 meters higher than the city. Wudu uses the city as a dike, and the Bailong River has become a river in the sky.

Some people say that soil erosion upstream will only wash away the "rice bowls" upstream and will not float away the "rice bowls" in the middle reaches. But government officials in some provinces in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River feel that the "rice bowls" in the middle reaches are also threatened. Dongting Lake is gradually being silted up, and its flood-carrying capacity is drastically reduced. Last year's autumn flood caused the water level to generally exceed the warning line, approaching the water level of the 1954 major flood, with 68 places exceeding the dangerous water level; 25 dikes along the river in Hubei Province collapsed, and the province had more than 4 million disaster victims. The lower reaches of the Yangtze River are also frequently in danger.

	Eliminate the flaw of only destroying and not building

Although the Yangtze River can no longer return to its original ecological system, the flaw of only destroying and not building its ecology must be eliminated.

Since the 1950s, people have opened up land for farming "from the mountain peaks to the riverbanks" for survival, and the severely damaged Yangtze River ecological system has not yet recovered. Entering the 1980s, people, for development, have opened new wounds on the old scars of the Yangtze River. In the mountainous areas, gates are opened for construction, road building, mining... A road is built, and a strip of forest disappears. Freely dumping soil and gravel, once a mountain flood erupts, it rushes down, turning into a river of mud. In some counties, the amount of waste from mining accounts for 40% of the total erosion. Cheng County, once praised as a treasure land of Longnan, discovered an open-air aluminum-zinc mine, which was mined by the Baiyin Company. However, there were no measures to prevent water and soil erosion in the design and construction. Now, 1 billion tons of soil layers have been peeled off the ground.

The Yangtze River ecology, which was already in dire need of recovery, now faces the situation of one place being treated while many places are destroyed, and point treatment while surface destruction. The departments causing water and soil erosion are too many, while the authority of the soil conservation department is too little. The original primitive forest sea of Yunnan Dongchuan 300 years ago has now become an internationally famous severe erosion area; a unit named by the State Council as an advanced unit for water and soil conservation in the Yangtze River in the 1950s has now become a "major erosion unit." A senior engineer's complaint expressed the worries of many "old Yangtze River" people: "We who work on soil conservation have become 'cleaners,' not only can I not fix the Yangtze River, but my descendants will also have a hard time!"

　　长江秋汛发出的警告
    新华社记者  徐士杰  张松青
    百年未遇的长江秋汛早已泄入东海。这场洪水提出的长江生态问题，却在大江两岸沸沸扬扬，羁留不去。
    　　　　水量不大，为何重灾
    罕见的长江秋水就水量而言，仍属小股洪水。虽然水量不大，但水位高，险情重。国家有关部门原准备把“两江一湖”（浙江、黑龙江水灾和湖北旱灾）列为水旱重灾省份；这场秋水袭来之时，又冲出一块洞庭湖灾区，“两江一湖”变成了“两江两湖”。湖南洞庭湖区许多堤垸纷纷崩溃，４７０万亩农田被淹；湖北省６５０万亩农田遭受水灾，其中４７万亩基本无收。长江中游两岸，长时间超过警戒水位２米左右。武汉关洪水水位达到２７．９０米，为当地有水文记录以来１２３年间同期所未有。
    长江不在主汛期，却爆发了罕见秋水；洪水不大，却损失惨重。这是大自然对人类滥砍森林、破坏生态的惩罚吗？
    仁者见仁，智者见智，但事实是人们认同的。长江两岸失去了森林的庇护，赤身裸体经风雨侵蚀，“三天烈日禾枯死，半日暴雨山洪来”，严重冲击了正常的生产、生活秩序。致使在北京、上海等地就读的一些湖北籍学生，刚领到旱灾补贴，又开始申请水灾补助。
    　　　　洪水冲走“饭碗”
    长江洪水裹挟着泥沙，填平了云梦古泽，创造了肥沃的两湖平原和长江三角洲。长江对人类的卓越功绩，如今开始变成严重威胁。今天，长江仍在把泥沙源源输入两岸湖泊。“千湖之省”湖北８０％的湖泊已经消亡，曾是全国最大的淡水湖——洞庭湖也日趋萎缩，退居第二。
    ３０年来，长江水土流失有增无减，洪水不停地冲刷上游瘠薄的土层。全流域１８０万平方公里，水土流失面积已由３６万平方公里，增至目前的５６万平方公里以上，年土壤侵蚀量达２２亿多吨。泥沙滚滚沉入江河湖泊。
    长江水土流失正在危及上游的“饭碗”。长江上游山丘土层平均厚度３０至５０厘米，按剧烈流失程度计算，３０至５０年后，山上的土壤将统统流入江河。现在，湖北郧西县一些居民点上的居民已经无地可耕，被迫迁徙他乡；贵州清镇、赫章两县，每年有５０００亩土地土层流失、土地“石化”。土之不存，人将焉附？
    长江上游白龙江两岸土壤被洪水剥离地面，就近沉入白龙江中游武都县附近河床，河床抬高速度已由４０年前年上升４厘米，发展到１９８８年的１２．５厘米。如今，武都城外，河底比城高出１8米。武都以城代堤，白龙江成为天上悬河。
    有人说，土从上游流失，洪水只会冲走上游的“饭碗”，不会漂走中游的“饭碗”。但长江中游一些省份的政府负责人深感：中游的“饭碗”也在受到威胁。洞庭湖日渐被泥沙淤塞，容洪量剧减。去年一场秋水，就使水位普遍超过警戒线，接近１９５４年特大洪水水位，６８处超过危险水位；湖北省沿江２５个民垸崩溃，全省出现４００多万灾民。长江下游也频频告急。
    　　　　革除只破不立之弊
    长江虽再也无法重返原始生态系统，但对长江生态只破不立之弊亟待革除。
    ５０年代以来，人们为了生存，开荒种地“上到山尖尖、下到水边边”，遭受严重破坏的长江生态系统尚未治愈。进入８０年代，人们为了发展，又在长江的旧创伤上撕开新伤口。山区敞开山门，基建、修路、开矿……一条公路修过去，一带森林变乌有。自由卸土、卸碴，一遇山洪爆发，飞流直下，泥流成河。有的县开矿废弃物的流失量，占流失总量的４０％。曾被誉为陇南宝地的成县，发现露天铝锌矿后由白银公司开采，但设计、施工中无任何防止水土流失的措施，如今有１亿吨土层被剥离地面。
    本来就百废待兴的长江生态，如今又出现一方治理、多方破坏，点上治理、面上破坏的情况。造成水土流失的部门太多，而土保部门的权限太少。３００年前的原始林海云南东川，现在成了闻名国际的严重流失区；５０年代国务院命名的长江水土保持先进单位，如今又成了“流失大户”。一位高级工程师的牢骚表达了许多“老长江”的忧虑：“我们搞土保的变成了‘擦屁股’的，不但我治不好长江，我子孙也难哇！”
