The Finnish team won all three of their matches in the Xiamen International Women's Football Tournament. The Chinese team drew with the Fujian team.

Xiamen, January 14th (Reported by Wang Dazhao) — After 80 minutes of a "water battle," the score remained 0-0. The Chinese women's football team drew with the Fujian team. Head coach Shang Ruihua stood up, shook his head, and seemed somewhat dissatisfied. Coach Lin Xin Hong told reporters that the national team's ability to play in such "waterlogged" conditions is far inferior to that of the Fujian team.

A day and night of rain left the Xiamen People's Stadium filled with puddles. Today, six teams played the third round of the International Women's Football Invitational Tournament. The Japanese team, which had the most significant gains, created a new record for the highest number of wins in their team's history by defeating the Philippine Makati Club team 13-0. The Japanese team scored six goals in the first half, but they continued their relentless attacks, scoring once every six or seven minutes, fully enjoying their time on the field. Number 16, Kuroda Kiyoko, scored five goals, and number 17, Tetsuka Takako, scored four.

The Finnish team faced strong resistance from the Xiamen team and did not score in the first half. In the second half, the Xiamen team made defensive mistakes, allowing the opponent to score three goals through a combination of shots and penalties, ultimately losing 0-3.

On the 16th, the Chinese team will face the Japanese team. If they win, they can secure the championship by drawing with the Finnish team in the final match. If the Chinese and Japanese teams draw, the Chinese team must win against the Finnish team on the 18th to determine the final standings based on goal differential. If the Chinese team loses to the Japanese team, they might drop to third place.

　　厦门国际女足赛芬兰队三战三捷
    中国队被福建队逼和
    本报厦门１月１４日电  记者汪大昭报道：８０分钟的“水战”结束了，记分牌上依然是０∶０，中国女子足球队被福建队逼和。主教练商瑞华站起身，摇摇头，似乎不大满意。教练蔺心红对记者说，国家队踢这种“水球”的能力远不如福建队。
    一天一夜的阴雨，弄得厦门人民体育场里到处积水，六支球队今天深一脚浅一脚地进行了国贸杯国际女足邀请赛第三轮比赛。收获最大的日本队创造了建队以来赢球的最高纪录。以１３∶０大胜菲律宾马基沓俱乐部队。上半时日本队已打进６个球，但日本队仍不留情面地继续攻击，平均六七分钟就有一次破门，过足了球瘾。１６号黑田今日子独得５分，１７号手塚贵子踢进４球。
    芬兰队在厦门队的顽强抵抗面前，斗了半场还未开张。下半时厦门队防守出了毛病，被对方连踢带罚进了３个球，以０∶３败阵。
    中国队１６日与日本队交锋，如能取胜，则最后战平芬兰队，夺冠问题也不大，如中日战成平手，１８日中国队必须打赢芬兰队，才能计算球数排列名次；而中国队若输给日本队，弄不好要降到第三名去。
