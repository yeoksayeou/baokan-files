Comrades:

Today, we gather here to celebrate the arrival of a new year. On behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, I extend New Year greetings to all present, to all members of the democratic parties and non-partisan patriots, to all people of all ethnic groups across the country, to our compatriots in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao, and to our overseas Chinese.

Over the past decade of reform and opening up, our country has undergone tremendous changes. Our social productive forces have developed rapidly, our national economic strength has been significantly enhanced, and the living standards of our people have improved markedly. More importantly, we are seeking a path, in accordance with China's national conditions, through continuous practice and exploration, to enable socialism, which once had great appeal to the working people of the world, to shed its outdated system that is increasingly unable to adapt to the further development of productive forces, and to regain its inherent superiority and vitality. This is pioneering and, of course, arduous and complex.

In a country as large as China, conducting such a vast and complex reform is bound to encounter difficulties and problems. The most prominent issue over the past year has been the obvious inflation. I believe everyone knows that many countries have experienced severe inflation during their economic takeoff stages. However, our country should not achieve economic development at the cost of high inflation. The Central Committee of the Party and the State Council have proposed to make the price increase in 1989 significantly lower than in 1988. We are a socialist country and can achieve development in stability. However, precisely because we are operating a commodity economy under socialist conditions with public ownership as the mainstay, we have encountered many new problems for which there are no ready-made solutions, either domestically or internationally. For example, under public ownership, after decentralization and activation, how to establish a mechanism to constrain fixed asset investment, how to effectively control the spontaneous rapid growth of consumption funds, and correspondingly, how to maintain the overall balance and reasonable structure of credit, and so on. Without sufficient practice, many new situations are difficult to fully anticipate; many new problems are difficult to design a perfect set of countermeasures in advance. There are bound to be shortcomings, mistakes, and setbacks in the work. However, as experience and lessons accumulate, our methods for solving these new problems are increasing, and measures will become more and more perfect.

Since the Third Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee decided to rectify the economic environment, rectify the economic order, and deepen the reform comprehensively, the series of measures taken by the Central Committee and the State Council have begun to take effect. A large number of construction projects that should be suspended or slowed down are being gradually curtailed, bank savings are increasing, the price increase rate is decreasing, and the prices of some production materials and consumer goods have begun to fall. In this round of rectification and rectification, we have learned from historical experiences and lessons, focusing on adjusting the economic structure, following industrial policies, pressing what should be pressed and protecting what should be protected. If this adjustment is successful, it will make China's economic structure more rational, improve the economic environment and economic order, and greatly promote the establishment of a new order for socialist commodity economy. This will mean an improvement in efficiency and quality for the entire national economy. Therefore, rectification and rectification are entirely positive and consistent with the direction of reform.

The rectification and rectification have only just begun, and we must not overestimate the achievements made so far. The task is still very arduous and allows no relaxation. We must firmly carry out the measures issued by the Central Committee of the Party and the State Council on rectification and rectification, and at the same time, actively explore new means and methods for macro-control of the national economy in practice. We still face many difficulties. It is wrong to waver in the general policy of reform and opening up because of difficulties; it is even more wrong to doubt and negate the socialist system from the root because of difficulties. We must adhere to the two basic points in the Party's basic line. We are pleased to see that on this fundamental issue, we share the same understanding with the democratic parties and patriotic figures from all walks of life. In the previous period of rectification and rectification, the democratic parties and patriotic figures from all walks of life have done a lot of work. We believe that through the joint efforts of all, and through the joint struggle of all ethnic groups across the country, the work of rectifying the economic environment and rectifying the economic order will definitely achieve the expected goals. China's reform will continue to advance and achieve greater success.

While deepening the reform of the economic system and focusing on economic construction, we must also actively and solidly promote the reform of China's political system. In our country, strengthening democratic construction relies on the system of people's congresses, the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the Communist Party. These fundamental systems are historically formed, chosen by the Chinese people, and should be further improved rather than weakened. These fundamental systems are suitable for China's national conditions, especially for the needs of China's economic and cultural revitalization. Under these systems, voters can vote according to their personal will without interference; under these systems, major state decisions and legislation are made by the power organs composed of people's representatives after extensive consultation and dialogue, and some are made after soliciting opinions from the whole people. We need a continuously improving democracy, and at the same time, we need a stable order to ensure that economic and cultural construction can proceed smoothly, and to enable our country and nation to get rid of poverty and backwardness as soon as possible. Turmoil and chaos do not conform to the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation. On this point, the broad masses of people from all parties, all strata, and all ethnic groups have the broadest consensus. We hope to work together with comrades from all democratic parties and non-partisan to further improve the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the Communist Party, improve the democratic and scientific level of state decision-making, better implement mutual supervision, especially strengthen supervision over the Communist Party and the government, and make great efforts to promote the cleanliness of party and government organs. We will mobilize the enthusiasm of all parties to consolidate and develop China's stable, united, democratic, and harmonious political situation, and make unremitting efforts for the realization of the Four Modernizations, the revitalization of China, and the unification of the motherland.

Finally, I wish everyone good health and new achievements in the coming year!

　　赵紫阳在全国政协元旦茶话会上致词
  　坚定不移治理整顿在稳定中求得发展
    完善民主安定秩序推进政治体制改革
    本报北京１月１日讯  赵紫阳在全国政协元旦茶话会上的贺词，全文如下：同志们：　今天，我们在这里欢庆新的一年的来临，我代表中共中央、国务院向在座各位，向各民主党派、无党派爱国人士，向全国各族人民，向台湾同胞、港澳同胞和海外侨胞，致以节日的问候。
    实行改革开放十年来，我们国家发生了很大的变化。我们的社会生产力有了比较迅速的发展，国家的经济实力有了较大的增强，人民的生活有了明显的提高。更重要的是，我们正在根据中国的国情，通过不断的实践和探索，来寻找一条道路，使曾对全世界劳动人民具有伟大吸引力的社会主义，摆脱其越来越难于适应生产力进一步发展的旧体制，重新显示出它固有的优越性和生命力。这是具有开创意义的，当然也是艰难而复杂的。
    在中国这样一个大国，进行这样一场巨大而复杂的改革，不可能一帆风顺。我们面前有不少困难和问题，去年以来最突出的就是出现了明显的通货膨胀。我想大家都知道，世界上许多国家在经济起飞阶段曾经出现过严重的通货膨胀。但是，我们国家不应该以高通货膨胀来换取经济的发展。党中央和国务院提出，要使１９８９年的物价上涨幅度明显低于１９８８年。我们是社会主义国家，有可能求得稳定中的发展。但是，也正由于我们是在以公有制为主的社会主义条件下搞商品经济，所以遇到了许多在国内外都没有现成经验可供运用的新问题。例如，在公有制条件下，放权、搞活以后，如何建立固定资产投资的约束机制，如何有效地控制消费基金的自发过快增长，以及相应地如何保持信贷的总量平衡和合理结构等等。在未经一定实践的情况下，许多新情况很难完全预见到；对许多新问题，很难预先就设计出一套完美无缺的对策。工作中也难免有缺点、失误和挫折。但是，随着经验教训的积累，我们解决这些新问题的办法正在多起来，措施将会越来越完善。
    自从十三届三中全会决定治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序、全面深化改革以来，中央和国务院采取的一系列措施已开始生效。大批应当停缓的基建项目在陆续压下来，银行储蓄在增加，物价涨幅在减少，一部分生产资料和生活资料的价格开始下降。在这次治理、整顿中，我们吸取历史的经验教训，着重在调整经济结构上下功夫，按照产业政策，该压的压，该保的保。这次调整如获成功，将使我国的经济结构进一步合理化，经济环境和经济秩序得到真正的改善，并能大大促进社会主义商品经济新秩序的建立。这对于整个国民经济将意味着效益和质量的提高。因此，治理、整顿完全是积极的，和改革的方向是一致的。
    治理、整顿才开始不久，对已取得的成效决不能估计过高，任务仍然非常艰巨，容不得半点松懈。必须把党中央、国务院发布的关于治理、整顿的措施，坚定不移地贯彻下去，同时在实践中积极探索对国民经济进行宏观控制的新的手段和方法。我们面临的困难还很多。因为困难而对改革、开放的总方针总政策发生动摇，是错误的；那种因为困难而从根本上怀疑、否定社会主义制度的思潮，更是错误的。必须坚持党的基本路线中的两个基本点。我们感到高兴的是，在这个根本问题上，我们同各民主党派和各界爱国人士有着共同的认识。在前一段治理、整顿工作中，各民主党派、各界爱国人士都作了不少工作。我们相信，在大家的共同努力下，经过全国各族人民共同奋斗，治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序的工作一定能够达到预期的目的。中国的改革一定会继续前进，取得更大的成就。
    在深化经济体制改革，抓紧经济建设的同时，我们还要积极地、扎扎实实地推进我国的政治体制改革。在我国，加强民主建设，要靠人民代表大会制、共产党领导下的多党合作制和政治协商制。这些根本制度，是历史形成的，是中国人民的选择，应当进一步完善，而决不能削弱。这些根本制度，适合中国的国情，尤其适合中国经济文化振兴的需要。这些制度可以保证选民在不受干扰的情况下，按照个人的意志投票选举；在这些制度下，国家重大决策和立法，是经过广泛协商对话，有些则经过全民征求意见之后，由人民代表组成的权力机关决定的。我们需要有不断完善的民主，同时我们又需要有安定的秩序，以使经济文化建设能够顺利进行，使我们的国家和民族尽快摆脱贫穷落后状态。动荡和混乱不符合中华民族的根本利益。在这一点上，各党派、各阶层、各民族广大群众，有着最广泛的共识。我们希望同各民主党派和无党派的同志一起，共同努力，进一步完善共产党领导下的多党合作制度和政治协商制度，提高国家决策的民主化和科学化水平，更好地实行互相监督，特别是加强对共产党和政府的监督，下大力量搞好党政机关的廉洁，进一步调动起各方面的积极因素，巩固和发展我国安定、团结、民主、和谐的政治局面，为实现四化、振兴中华，为祖国的统一，进行不懈的努力。
    最后，祝大家在新的一年里身体健康，在工作中取得新的成就！
