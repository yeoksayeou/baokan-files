As night falls and the lights come on, the grassroots cultural institutions scattered across Jiangsu's cities and countryside spring to life. The pursuit of joy, knowledge, skills, and beauty has breathed new vigor into Jiangsu's mass cultural activities.

In recent years, Jiangsu's cities and countryside have witnessed a thriving scene of social cultural endeavors. The province has essentially formed a network of urban and rural mass cultural institutions encompassing state-owned, collective, individual, and joint ventures. Statistics show that every township in the province has a cultural station, and 80% of the townships have established cultural centers of a certain scale. Many villages and township enterprises have also set up clubs and cultural rooms. Cultural stations in urban neighborhoods have been universally established, and new residential areas pay attention to the construction of cultural facilities. In addition, more than 100,000 cultural service households and cultural professional households have emerged, supplementing the grassroots cultural network in cities and countryside. Jiangsu's mass cultural institutions universally carry out the activity of "culture as the main focus, multiple industries supporting culture." Preliminary statistics show that last year, the operational value of cultural supplementary economic activities in the province's mass cultural institutions exceeded 200 million yuan, and the income from various economic services used to supplement cultural funds exceeded 20 million yuan.

The widespread cultural network has enriched the leisure time of the masses. During their free time, people can easily go to cultural palaces and stations to participate in activities they enjoy. People of different ages and aesthetic levels can all find their own pleasure in the small grassroots cultural venues and, in the process, enjoy beauty and gain new knowledge.

As the cultural level of the masses improves, their amateur cultural activities have also ascended to the grand stage. Many young and middle-aged professional performers who are still active on stages across the province and beyond were initially discovered through mass cultural activities.

　　求乐　求知　求技　求美
    江苏群众文化事业兴旺
    据新华社南京一月二十二日电（记者李巍）夜幕降临，华灯初上，遍布江苏城乡的基层文化单位便开始活跃起来。“求乐、求知、求技、求美”的丰富内容使江苏群众文化活动获得了蓬勃生机。
    近年来，江苏城乡出现了社会办文化的兴旺景象，目前已基本形成国家、集体、个体及联合体等体制的城乡群众文化网络。据统计，全省农村乡乡有文化站，百分之八十的乡镇建立了具有一定规模的文化中心，不少村庄和乡镇企业也建立了俱乐部、文化室。全省城市街道文化站已普及，新建住宅区也注意到文化设施的配套建设。此外，十多万个文化服务户和文化专业户异军突起，成为城乡基层文化网点的补充。江苏省群众文化单位普遍开展了“以文为主，多业助文”的活动。据初步统计，去年全省群众文化单位补文经营活动产值突破二亿元，多种经营服务收入用于补文的经费超过二千万元。
    星罗棋布的文化网点，丰富了群众的业余生活。闲暇时间，人们可以就近来到文化馆、站参加自己喜爱的活动。不同年龄结构、不同审美层次的人都能在小小的基层文化场所各得其乐，并在愉悦中得到美的享受和新知识的启迪。
    随着群众文化水平的提高，群众的业余文化活动也登上大雅之堂。不少至今仍活跃在省内外舞台上的专业中青年演员，当初都是从群众文化活动中脱颖而出的。
