Japan has been steadily advancing its "science and technology nation" strategy since it proposed the slogan in 1979. Official statistics recently released indicate that in the fiscal year 1987, Japan's total research and development expenditure amounted to 983.66 billion yen (approximately $7.87 billion at the current exchange rate), which is 2.7 times the amount spent a decade ago and accounts for 2.8% of the national GDP. Of this total, 649 billion yen was allocated by enterprises, constituting 78.4% of the total expenditure, while universities and national research institutions together contributed 334 billion yen, making up 21.5%. In terms of research areas, 61.7% was spent on development research, 24.3% on applied research, and 14% on basic research.

These figures reveal that the driving force behind Japan's "science and technology nation" strategy is private enterprises, with industrial technology being the primary focus. These two characteristics are indeed the fundamental experiences of Japan's rapid development in science and technology since the war.

Japan's main targets in high-tech development are the three fundamental technology fields of microelectronics, new materials, and biotechnology—focused on the microscopic world of molecules, atoms, cells, and genes. Since the early 1980s, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry's "Next-Generation Industrial Technology Development Plan" and the Science and Technology Agency's "Creative Science and Technology Plan" have been implemented annually, with research projects in the aforementioned three fundamental technology areas.

To rapidly, efficiently, and economically develop high technology, Japan has adopted and is continuing to adopt various measures. The most effective method is to "concentrate forces to tackle key problems": organizing the scientific and technological strengths of the government, universities, and private enterprises to systematically and step-by-step overcome high-tech challenges. To promote cooperation and collaboration among various scientific and technological research and development institutions, the government has also formulated the "Law to Promote Research Exchange."

Building or expanding research and development institutions is a significant part of the equipment investment by Japanese enterprises during the "yen appreciation boom." Following the "central research institute construction boom" of the 1960s, Japanese enterprises are now experiencing a "basic research institute construction boom." Renowned enterprises such as Hitachi, Mitsubishi Electric, NEC, Fujitsu, and Ajinomoto all possess advanced and powerful research teams. Their basic research capabilities are not inferior to those of universities and national research institutions.

Just as in economic development, Japan now has sufficient confidence and is determined to demonstrate its originality and capabilities in the field of science and technology. It can be foreseen that in the 1990s and the 21st century, Japan will achieve results in advancing its "science and technology nation" strategy that are commensurate with its efforts.

### 日本稳步推进“科技立国”战略  民间企业是推进主力　工业技术为主攻对象

　　日本稳步推进“科技立国”战略
    民间企业是推进主力　工业技术为主攻对象
    据新华社东京１２月３０日电  （记者张可喜）日本自１９７９年提出“科学技术立国”的口号后，目前正稳步推进这一有远见的战略。
    官方不久前发表的统计说，１９８７年度日本全国的研究开发经费为９８３６６亿日元（按目前汇率，约合７８７亿美元），为１０年前的２．７倍，占国民总产值的２．８％。其中，企业研究开发经费为６４９００亿，占总额的７８．４％，大学和国立科研机构共３３４００亿，占总额的２１．５％。按研究领域计算，开发研究占６１．７％，应用研究占２４．３％，基础研究占１４％。
    上述数据说明，日本推进“科学技术立国”战略的主力军是民间企业，工业技术是主攻对象。这两大特点实际上也是日本在战后高速度发展科学技术的基本经验。
    日本发展高科技的主攻目标是微电子、新材料和生物技术等三大基础技术领域——分子、原子、细胞、基因等微观世界。通产省的“下一代产业基础技术研究开发计划”和科技厅的“创造性科学技术计划”自８０年代初实施以来，每年都有上述三大基础技术研究课题上马。
    日本为高速度、高效率和经济地发展高科技，已经和正在采取多方面的措施。最主要的办法还是“集中力量攻关”：组织政府、大学和民间企业的科学技术力量，重点地、有步骤地攻克高技术难题。为促进各种科学技术研究开发机关之间的联合与合作，政府还制定了《促进研究交流法》。
    新建或扩建研究开发机构，是日本企业在“日元升值景气”中进行设备投资的重要内容。继６０年代的“建设中央研究所热”之后，目前日本企业中又出现了“建立基础研究所热”，著名企业，如日立、三菱电机、日本电气富士通、味之素等都拥有设备先进、实力雄厚的研究阵容，其基础研究水平并不在大学和国立科研机关以下。
    和在经济发展上一样，日本现在已有充分的自信心，决意在科学技术领域显示其独创精神和能力。可以预见，在９０年代，２１世纪，日本在推进“科学技术立国”战略方面会取得与其努力程度相适应的成果。
