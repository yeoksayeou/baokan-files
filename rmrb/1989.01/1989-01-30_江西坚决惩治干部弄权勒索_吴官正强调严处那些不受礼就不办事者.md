Jiangxi resolutely punishes officials for abusing power and extortion

Brü Guanzheng emphasizes severe punishment for those who refuse to act without gifts

	Nanchang, January 29 (Xinhua and People's Daily reporters Liang Xing and Zhao Xiangru) -- On January 27 in the afternoon, Jiangxi Provincial Party Secretary and Governor Brü Guanzheng, in front of the provincial municipal Party secretaries, some bureau and ministry heads, and news reporters, loudly declared: "Various municipal and county-level governments are not allowed to send gifts to the provincial level. If anyone comes to the province to handle business and fails to get it done because they did not send a gift, they can come to me to expose the problem, or write to me. Those who do not act without receiving gifts will be severely punished and resolutely removed from provincial-level agencies. For those who dare to expose problems, we will give encouragement, and for the matters they request to handle, we will give priority arrangements. If it can be solved, we will definitely help solve it. We talk about integrity, and we must take severe measures, otherwise, it will not be enough to gain the trust of the people."

	Brü Guanzheng made these remarks at a meeting of the provincial Party committee with municipal Party secretaries.

	At the meeting, a responsible comrade from the provincial discipline inspection commission said that according to preliminary statistics on 1988 disciplinary cases, economic disciplinary cases accounted for 82% of all cases handled by disciplinary inspection departments at all levels in the province; cases involving amounts of 100,000 yuan or more and county-level or higher officials accounted for 48% of all economic cases. Particularly noteworthy is that among these economic disciplinary cases involving the exchange of power and money, 1/5 involved newly promoted officials.

	At this meeting, which focused on discussing how the Party and government can eliminate corruption and maintain integrity, the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee proposed that the current key issues to be addressed are:

	-- The behavior of office workers using their power to accept bribes, embezzle, and extort must be firmly grasped, with concentrated efforts to investigate thoroughly.

	-- The use of power and public funds to build private homes.

	-- The use of public funds for banquets, gifts, extravagant spending, and public-funded travel.

	-- The behavior of using power for personal gain in recruitment, employment, and admissions.

　　江西坚决惩治干部弄权勒索    
    吴官正强调严处那些不受礼就不办事者
    本报南昌１月２９日电  新华社记者梁星、本报记者赵相如报道：１月２７日下午，江西省委副书记、省长吴官正当着全省地市委书记、部分厅局长和新闻记者的面大声疾呼：“各地市县不准给省里送东西，凡来省办事因没送礼而没办成事者，可以找我揭发问题，写信给我也行。对那些不受礼就不办事者，要严肃处理，坚决调出省级机关。对于敢于揭发问题的人要给予鼓励，对他要求办的事给以优先安排，能解决的一定帮助解决。我们讲廉洁，一定要采取严厉措施，不然不足以取信于民。”
    吴官正的这番话是在省委召开的全省地市委书记会上讲的。
    会上，省纪委负责同志说，据对１９８８年违纪案件初步统计，全省各级纪律检查部门查处的违纪案件中，经济方面的违纪案件占全部案件的８２％；违纪金额万元以上、违纪对象县级以上的大案要案占全部经济案件的４８％。特别引人注目的是，这类以权力与金钱作交易的经济违纪案件中，竟有１／５涉及到刚提拔不久的新干部。
    江西省委在这个着重讨论党和政府如何消除腐败现象，保持廉洁的会上，提出当前应抓的重点问题是：
    ——机关工作人员利用职权受贿贪污、弄权勒索的行为，对其中的大案要案要抓住不放，集中力量，一查到底。
    ——利用职权和公款营造私房。
    ——利用公款请客送礼、滥发钱物、公费旅游。
    ——招工、招干、招生中以权谋私行为。
