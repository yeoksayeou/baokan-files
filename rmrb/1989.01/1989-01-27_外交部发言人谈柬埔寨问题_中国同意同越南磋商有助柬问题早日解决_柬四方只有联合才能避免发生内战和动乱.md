Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Li Zhaoxing said at a press conference this afternoon that China agrees to hold consultations with Vietnam to promote a just and reasonable political solution to the Cambodian issue at an early date and to achieve peace in Cambodia.

Vietnamese Deputy Foreign Minister Dinh Nho Liem recently visited China and held internal consultations with Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Liu Shuzhi on the political solution to the Cambodian issue. When asked why China, apart from discussing the issue of Vietnam's complete withdrawal from Cambodia, also talked about the domestic aspects of the Cambodian issue, Li Zhaoxing said, "The Cambodian issue is caused by Vietnam's aggression. Vietnam, of course, bears an irresistible responsibility for the comprehensive solution to the Cambodian issue, including the domestic aspects of the Cambodian issue caused by Vietnam's aggression in Cambodia."

Li Zhaoxing also said, "We advocate that, with the true withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia, the four factions in Cambodia should achieve national reconciliation and form a transitional quadripartite coalition government led by Prince Sihanouk to prepare for future elections and to make proper arrangements for the various Cambodian forces. No faction should be excluded, nor should any faction be allowed to monopolize power. After the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops, any faction attempting to monopolize power is impossible and unacceptable to the international community. Only through the unity of the four factions can internal war and turmoil be avoided. This is not only beneficial to the Cambodian people but also to neighboring countries such as Vietnam and Thailand. It is also the universal wish of the international community."

When asked about the various proposals in the international community for holding an international conference on the Cambodian issue, Li Zhaoxing said, "We have always supported all suggestions and actions that help to justly and reasonably resolve the Cambodian issue. We believe that the relevant parties should first reach an agreement on the political solution to the Cambodian issue, and then hold an international conference to provide international guarantees for the implementation of the agreement and for Cambodia's independence, neutrality, and non-aligned status. At that time, China is willing to participate in the relevant international guarantees with other countries."

　　外交部发言人谈柬埔寨问题    
    中国同意同越南磋商有助柬问题早日解决     
    柬四方只有联合才能避免发生内战和动乱
    新华社北京１月２６日电  中国外交部发言人李肇星在今天下午的新闻发布会上说，中国同意同越南进行磋商是为了推动柬埔寨问题早日获得公正合理的政治解决，在柬埔寨实现和平。
    越南外交部副部长丁儒廉日前来华同中国副外长刘述卿就政治解决柬埔寨问题进行了内部磋商。当记者问到中国除与越南讨论越南从柬全部撤军的问题外，为何还要谈柬埔寨问题的国内方面的问题时，李肇星说，柬埔寨问题是越南侵略造成的，越南对全面解决柬埔寨问题，包括由于越南侵略柬埔寨所造成的柬埔寨问题的国内方面，当然负有不可推卸的责任。
    李肇星还说，“我们主张，随着越南真正从柬全部撤军，柬埔寨四方应实现民族和解，成立以西哈努克亲王为首的过渡性的四方临时联合政府，负责筹组将来的大选，并对柬埔寨各派军队作出妥善安排。不能排斥任何一方，也不能让任何一方独家掌权。任何一派在越南撤军后想独家掌权，都是不可能的，也是国际社会所无法接受的。只有四方联合，才能避免发生内战和动乱。这不仅有利于柬埔寨人民，也有利于越南、泰国等邻国。这也是国际社会的普遍愿望。”
    有记者问，现在国际社会有各种关于召开柬埔寨问题的国际会议的主张，中国对此持何态度？
    李肇星说，“我们历来支持一切有助于公正、合理地解决柬埔寨问题的建议和行动。我们认为应当先由有关各方就政治解决柬问题达成协议，然后召开国际会议，对协议的实施以及柬的独立、中立、不结盟地位提供国际保证。届时中国愿意同其它国家一道，参加有关的国际保证。”
