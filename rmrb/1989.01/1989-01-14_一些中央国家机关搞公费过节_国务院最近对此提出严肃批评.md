Some central government agencies have been engaging in publicly funded celebrations. The State Council recently issued a serious criticism regarding this issue.

A batch of agencies that excessively distributed money and goods during festivals recently received criticism from the State Council. Earlier, the State Council decided to conduct a thorough investigation into the excessive distribution of money and goods in September and October of 1988. A total of 74 units under the State Council's various ministries and directly affiliated institutions were investigated, and the Audit Office inspected 22 of these units. Based on the investigation results, the Audit Office issued a notice to central government agencies, commending the Supervision Bureau, the State Price Bureau, the State Council's Special Zone Office, and the State Council's Economic, Technological, and Social Development Research Center for strictly adhering to financial and economic regulations and not engaging in excessive distribution of money and goods during previous audits. However, units such as the Ministry of Water Resources, the Ministry of Communications, the State Bureau of Building Materials, the State Archives Bureau, and the State Council's Rural Development Research Center were criticized for continuing to engage in "publicly funded celebrations" by distributing money and goods excessively in the form of "living allowances" and food price subsidies despite prohibitions.

The State Council attached great importance to this investigation and, after hearing the report from the Audit Office, criticized the main leaders of the aforementioned units that engaged in excessive distribution of money and goods.

The notice from the Audit Office emphasized that, with the Spring Festival approaching, central government agencies must strictly adhere to the principle of not engaging in excessive distribution of money and goods and set an example. The Audit Office will focus on this during regular audits. If there are continued instances of excessive distribution of money and goods, they will be dealt with seriously in accordance with relevant regulations.

　　一些中央国家机关搞公费过节
    国务院最近对此提出严肃批评
    新华社北京１月１３日电  一批在节日期间滥发钱物的中央国家机关最近受到国务院批评。
    前不久，国务院决定对１９８８年９、１０月份滥发钱物情况进行一次彻底清查。共清查了国务院各部委、直属机构７４个单位，审计署抽查了其中２２个单位。审计署根据清查情况，向中央国家机关发出通报，对严格遵守财经制度，在历次审计中没有滥发钱物的监察部、国家物价局、国务院特区办、国务院经济技术社会发展研究中心，予以表扬；对有禁不止，在节日以“生活补助”、食品价格补贴等方式，滥发钱物较多，继续搞“公费过节”的水利部、交通部、国家建材局、国家档案局、国务院农村发展研究中心等单位，给予通报批评。
    国务院对这次清查工作很重视，听取审计署汇报后，对上述滥发钱物单位的主要领导人进行了批评。
    审计署的通报强调指出，春节即将来临，中央国家机关应严格做到不滥发钱物，起表率作用。审计署将在定期审计中，重点对此进行检查。如有继续滥发钱物者，要依照有关法规，严肃处理。
