The Suihua Region Handles a Case of Party Cadres Demanding Gifts

    Party and government cadres who exploit their power for extortion and bribery, Wang Peihe and Wang Ying from the traffic police squad of Wangkui County and the county's traffic management station party branch secretary respectively, have become negative examples in the Suihua Region's party and government discipline education.

    The negative example revolves around Wang Peihe and Wang Ying, who took advantage of their son's wedding to openly demand gifts totaling 20,000 yuan from all directions, hosting 110 banquet tables. The public discussed this widely, and many people came forward to expose and report the incident.

    Wang Peihe and Wang Ying's son got married on October 2, 1988. The couple, relying on their authority over traffic supervision and management, decided to seize the opportunity to make a large sum of money. They spread the news of their son's wedding through personal delivery of invitations, phone calls, and friends relaying the message, as well as sending notices from their units. Key units received a second notice, including over 90 vehicle-related units and more than 50 county-level departments and offices. To receive gifts, they set up a reception desk at the Friendship Grand Hotel, with Wang Peihe's brother-in-law, Xue Fang, keeping the accounts, and Wang Peihe's brother, Wang Zhimin, collecting the money. A total of 657 people sent gifts and attended the banquet, including 25 county-level cadres, 177 section-level cadres, 114 drivers, and 20 individual vehicle owners. The Wang couple used the 20,240 yuan in gifts to host a three-day banquet, spending 7,000 yuan, leaving 13,000 yuan. On the day of the wedding, they used four cars. To prepare for the wedding, from September 25 to October 2, over ten employees from their units were diverted from their work to help with the arrangements.

    Regarding the Wang couple's abuse of power and extortion, the disciplinary inspection departments of the Suihua Region and Wangkui County conducted an investigation and trial. Wang Peihe was given a two-year probationary period within the party and removed from his administrative position, and was transferred out of the public security forces. Wang Ying was removed from her position as party branch secretary. The gifts they demanded, excluding those from relatives, were all confiscated. Wang Peihe's brother-in-law, Xue Fang, who fabricated evidence and shielded the violators, also received a serious warning within the party.

　　绥化地区处理一起党员干部索礼事件    
    当事者受到党纪政纪处分
    本报讯  记者武培真报道：依仗权势敲诈勒索的黑龙江省望奎县交警大队长王佩和及县交通运输管理站党支部书记王颖，已成为黑龙江省绥化地区进行党纪政纪教育的反面教员。
    这个反面教材的中心内容是，王佩和、王颖夫妇俩借儿子结婚之机，从四面八方公开索要财礼达两万元之巨，大摆酒席１１０桌，群众街谈巷议，纷纷揭发检举。
    王佩和、王颖之子于去年１０月２日结婚，王氏夫妇自恃手中握有交通监理和交通运输管理的实权，决定乘机大捞一把。于是通过亲自送信、打电话和亲友转告及从单位派人四处下通知等手法，广为张扬儿子结婚之事。“重点”单位又进行第二次通知，其中有车单位９０多个，县部委办机关５０多个。为收受财礼，还在友谊大酒店设立了收礼处，由王佩和的姐夫薛芳记帐，王佩和的哥哥王志敏收款。随礼和参加吃喝者６５７人，其中，地县处级干部２５人，科级干部１７７人，汽车司机１１４人，个体车主２０人。望奎二王用所收礼金２０２４０元宴请三天，花费７０００元，剩１３０００元，结婚当日动用汽车４台。为筹办婚礼，从９月２５日直至１０月２日的８天中，二王单位共有十多名职工耽误工作为其操办。
    对于望奎二王以权谋私和敲诈勒索的行为，绥化地区望奎县纪检部门经调查审理，给王佩和留党察看两年、撤销行政职务处分，调离公安队伍；给王颖撤销党支部书记处分；其索要财物，扣除亲属所送部分，其它全部充公。王佩和姐夫薛芳，因制造假证，袒护违纪者，亦受到党内严重警告处分。
