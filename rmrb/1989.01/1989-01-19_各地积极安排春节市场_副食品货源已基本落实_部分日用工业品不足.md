To ensure that the broad masses of the people can celebrate the Spring Festival, commercial departments in various places have actively organized supplies and enriched the festival market. Currently, the supply of major staple foods such as meat, eggs, sugar, and vegetables has been basically secured. The supply of fruits, tobacco, alcohol, and various snacks is ample. Among daily industrial goods, festive items, decorative items, and small commodities are relatively abundant, but there is a shortage of some textiles and large durable consumer goods.

It is understood that since last November, the state-owned commercial sector has increased its pork inventory, and the supply for urban residents during the festival period is guaranteed, with some places even increasing the quantity. The supply of beef and mutton is abundant and can meet the festival market demand. Fresh eggs in most regions are at last year's level or slightly increased.

This Spring Festival, the supply of vegetables in various places has increased by 20% compared to last year. Many cities have set a maximum price for roadside vegetables, and it is expected that the supply situation in most regions will be better than last year, with prices stabilizing.

The market demand for daily industrial goods is strong. Some places have shortages of cotton fabric, polyester-cotton fabric, cotton-wool clothing, bedding, soap, detergent, as well as televisions, refrigerators, and washing machines, which are durable consumer goods. However, the key daily industrial goods released in major cities like Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai during the festival have increased.

Many provinces and cities have paid attention to the rural market when arranging festival goods. Shanghai has allocated 1.3 billion yuan worth of daily industrial goods to the rural markets in the suburbs, including 560 tons of detergent, 500,000 aluminum pots, 170,000 teapots, and 700,000 meters of polyester-cotton fabric. The Tianjin Supply and Marketing Cooperative has increased the amount of goods allocated by 16% compared to the same period last year. Jiangxi's Jiujiang City has allocated 105 million yuan worth of daily industrial goods to the rural market for the festival.

　　各地积极安排春节市场
    副食品货源已基本落实
    部分日用工业品不足
    本报讯  为了让广大人民群众欢度春节，各地商业部门积极组织货源，丰富节日市场。目前，肉、蛋、食糖以及蔬菜等主要副食品货源已基本落实，果品、烟酒、各色小食品数量充足，日用工业品中，喜庆商品、装饰用品、小商品较充裕，但部分纺织品和大件耐用消费品不足。
    据了解，去年１１月份以来，国营商业猪肉库存增加，节日期间城市居民定量保证供应，有的地方还增加了数量。牛羊肉货源充裕，可以满足节日市场。鲜蛋多数地区保持去年水平或略有增加。
    今年春节各地蔬菜上市量比去年增长２０％，许多城市对大路菜规定了最高限价，预计大部分地区供应状况将好于去年，价格趋稳。
    日用工业品市场需求旺盛，一些地方棉布、涤棉布、棉毛衫裤、床褥单、肥皂、洗衣粉及电视机、电冰箱、洗衣机等耐用消费品有缺口，但京津沪等大城市节日投放的重点日用工业品仍有增加。
    不少省市在安排节日商品时重视农村市场。上海投放郊县农村市场日用工业品１．３亿元，其中洗衣粉５６０吨，铝锅５万只、茶壶１．７万只、涤棉布７０万米。天津市供销社投放商品金额比去年同期增长１６％。江西九江市调拨到农村供应节日市场的日用工业品金额达１０５０万元。
