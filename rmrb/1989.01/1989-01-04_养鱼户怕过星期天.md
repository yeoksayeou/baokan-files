In recent years, our town has built over 3,000 mu of fish ponds in the Sancha River embankment, with more than 40 households farming here. On a Sunday in mid-September 1988, three small cars drove up to the Sancha River dike. Five or six people got out of the cars. A staff member from the town's aquaculture company introduced them, saying, "These are leaders from the city. They are bored in the city on Sundays, so they came here to fish and relax. Everyone should welcome them warmly." Each of them was an expert fisherman, and by the end of the day, they caught anywhere from a few kilograms to 20 kilograms. One official came to fish here four times in half a month, each time catching more than 12 kilograms. Every Sunday, some guests would travel over 80 kilometers round trip, driving small cars to the Sancha River to fish, and some even arranged for them to have a sumptuous lunch.

Statistics show that from early September to November 6 of last year, a total of 67 people came to fish at the Sancha River, catching over 400 kilograms of fish.

　　养鱼户怕过星期天
    近年来，我镇在三汊河垸新建了３０００多亩鱼池，４０多户农民在这里承包放养。１９８８年９月中旬的一个星期天，三汊河堤上开来了３辆小车，从车上走下来五六个人。镇鱼业公司干部向养鱼户介绍说：“这是市里来的领导人，星期天他们在城里闷得慌，特来这里钓鱼散心，大家要热情欢迎。”他们个个都是钓鱼能手，一天下来，少则钓几公斤，多则２０公斤。有一个干部，半个月内来这里钓鱼４次，每次都钓１２公斤以上。每逢星期天，一些客人就不惜往返８０多公里路程，开着小汽车来三汊河垂钓，有人还为他们安排丰盛的午餐。
    据统计，从去年９月初至１１月６日止，来三汊河垂钓的客人共６７人次，钓走成鱼４００多公斤。
