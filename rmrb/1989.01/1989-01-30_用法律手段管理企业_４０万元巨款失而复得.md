The Anyang City Industrial Products Trading Center has utilized legal means to manage the enterprise and protect its legal rights during its business operations. Over the past year, it has successfully recovered over 290,000 yuan in outstanding payments from other units and avoided economic losses amounting to over 100,000 yuan.

In the new situation of reform and opening up, this unit has emphasized the importance of legal management in enterprise operations and administration. It has organized its business personnel to systematically study the "Economic Contract Law," "General Principles of Civil Law," and "Civil Procedure Law." Based on the lessons learned from past economic disputes, they have revised and improved the clauses in their contracts and formulated interim measures for the management of economic contracts, thereby plugging potential loopholes.

Over the past year, the center's legal consultation office has handled 43 economic disputes. The center's business department had a loan dispute with a unit in Shashi, Hubei. Despite multiple attempts to resolve the issue, no progress was made. Through legal procedures, the center was able to recover over 50,000 yuan in loans in a short period.

　　用法律手段管理企业  ４０万元巨款失而复得
    安阳市工业品贸易中心在经营活动中，运用法律手段管理企业，维护企业的合法权益，一年多来，共收回外单位欠款２９万多元，避免经济损失１０多万元。
    这个单位在改革、开放的新形势下，重视依法进行企业经营和管理，组织业务人员系统地学习了《经济合同法》、《民法通则》、《民事诉讼法》。他们在总结以往发生经济纠纷教训的基础上，修改完善了合同书的条款，制定了经济合同管理暂行办法，堵死了可能出现的漏洞。
    一年来，中心的法律咨询办公室受理了各种经济纠纷４３起。中心经营科与湖北沙市一起贷款纠纷案，曾多次派人前去处理，毫无结果。通过法律程序，在很短时间内，把５万多元贷款追了回来。
