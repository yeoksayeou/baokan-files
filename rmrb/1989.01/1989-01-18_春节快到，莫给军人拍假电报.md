Dear Editor,

	As the Spring Festival is approaching, many soldiers in our unit receive telegrams from their families. The content of these telegrams is often "Father (Mother) is seriously ill, hurry back" or "Grandfather (Grandmother) is critically ill, hurry home." A significant number of these are "fake telegrams." The purpose of sending these telegrams is to make the children serving in the military return home for the Spring Festival. It is natural to feel homesick during festivals, and it is indeed good to be able to reunite with the family. However, the military has the sacred mission of defending the motherland and the Four Modernizations. The more important the festival, the heavier the tasks, and the more crucial it is to remain at the post. Sending fake telegrams to soldiers disrupts the normal work of the unit. I hope that the parents and other relatives of our soldiers can prioritize national interests and the overall situation of military construction, and encourage soldiers to serve diligently.

　　春节快到，莫给军人拍假电报
    编辑同志：
    每年春节前夕，我们部队的不少战士都收到家里的电报，电文多是“父（母）病重，速回。”“你爷（奶）病危，速归”之类，其中相当多数是“假电报”。拍电报的目的就是让服役的子弟回家过春节。“每逢佳节倍思亲”这是人之常情，新春佳节能合家团圆当然很好。但是，军队是执行保卫祖国、保卫四化神圣使命的，越是节日任务越重、越要坚守岗位。给战士拍“假电报”的后果是，干扰了部队正常工作，希望我们战士的父母和其他亲属，能以国家利益、军队建设大局为重，鼓励军人安心服役。　　                  　　总参某部　齐殿斌
