The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) has determined the list of party candidates for people's deputies. There will be a total of 2,250 national deputies, with 100 of them being members of the Communist Party.

New China News Agency, Moscow: On January 10, General Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, Gorbachev, reported to the Central Committee plenary session on the process of nominating party candidates for people's deputies and emphasized the need to strengthen the party's leadership role in the reform.

Last December, the Supreme Soviet of the USSR adopted a new election law, stipulating that one-third of the 2,250 national deputies will be elected by social organizations. Among the 750 deputies, the three largest social organizations in the Soviet Union—the Communist Party, trade unions, and cooperatives—will each have 100 representatives.

Gorbachev said that in the past month, more than 100,000 grassroots party organizations proposed a total of 31,500 candidates. City and district party committees, after discussions, selected 3,500 candidates to be submitted to higher-level party committees. The state and republic party committees recommended 207 names to the CPSU Central Committee.

According to the decision of the CPSU Central Election Commission, any Communist Party member or party organization that wishes to nominate party, state, and social activists or other well-known workers, peasants, and intellectuals from other regions as party candidates for people's deputies can directly submit their nominations to the CPSU Central Committee.

Gorbachev said that in the past month, the Central Committee has received 12,000 telegrams and letters proposing 382 candidates, most of whom are members of the Political Bureau, candidate members, and members of the Secretariat. About half of these 382 names are the same as the 207 names submitted by the republics. The Political Bureau selected 100 candidates from these two lists and submitted them for discussion at today's Central Committee plenary session.

The plenary session approved this list and decided to hold an expanded Central Committee plenary session on March 15-16 to vote on this list. The 100 elected deputies will be entrusted by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to attend the first session of the All-Union Congress of People's Deputies to be held in April this year.

Tass news agency broadcast Gorbachev's speech at the Central Committee plenary session on the evening of January 10, but did not release the list of 100 candidates.

　　苏共中央确定党内人民代表候选人名单
    全国代表２２５０名　共产党占１００名
    新华社莫斯科电  苏共中央委员会总书记戈尔巴乔夫１０日在苏共中央全会上介绍了党内提名人民代表候选人的经过，并强调要加强党在改革中的领导作用。
    去年１２月苏联最高苏维埃会议通过的新的选举法规定，全国２２５０名人民代表中的１／３将由社会组织选出。在７５０名代表中，苏联最大的三个社会组织——共产党、工会和合作社将各占１００名。
    戈尔巴乔夫说，在过去一个月里１０万多个基层党组织共提出３１５００名候选人。市和区党委经过讨论，选出３５００名报上级党委。州和加盟共和国党委将其中２０７人名单推荐给苏共中央委员会。
    根据苏共中央选举委员会的决定，任何一个共产党员或党组织，如果想提名党、国家和社会活动家或者其他地区著名的工人、农民和知识分子作党的人民代表候选人，可以直接向苏共中央委员会提出。
    戈尔巴乔夫说，一个月来党中央共收到１２０００封电报和信件，提出３８２名候选人，其中多数是提党中央政治局委员、候补委员和书记处成员。这３８２人名单中约有一半与加盟共和国提交的２０７人名单相同。政治局从这两个名单中选出１００名候选人，提交今天的中央全会讨论。
    全会通过了这个名单，并决定于３月１５日至１６日召开一次扩大的中央全会，对这个名单投票表决。选举出来的１００名代表将受苏联共产党的委托，出席今年４月召开的全国第一次人民代表大会。
    塔斯社１０日晚播发了戈尔巴乔夫在中央全会上的讲话，但是没有公布１００名候选人的名单。
