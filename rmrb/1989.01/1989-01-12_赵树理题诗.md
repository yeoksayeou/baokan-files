Zhao Shuli's Inscribed Poem

	The famous writer Zhao Shuli inscribed the following poem for the first mountain of Taihang:

	"Combing the wind and bathing in the rain to plant oil pines,
	The daily yield is small, but the annual yield is abundant.
	Do not say that the present is still like yesterday,
	A returning visitor recognizes the heroes."

	The first mountain of Taihang is located within the jurisdiction of Lingchuan County in Shanxi. In 1959, the Lingchuan County Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to mobilize 2,000 militiamen to plant trees on the mountain and green the first mountain of Taihang. At that time, Zhao Shuli went to Lingchuan and believed that the mountain had many rocks and trees would be difficult to survive, expressing his disapproval. The then County Committee Secretary, Xing Deyong, insisted on digging pits and planting trees. A few years later, Zhao Shuli went to Lingchuan County again and saw that the trees had all survived and the green shade covered the ground, full of vitality. He was very happy and, as a "visitor," wrote this poem under the green mountains and pines, sincerely thanking and praising the decision-makers and tree planters of the first mountain of Taihang at that time.

	This poem is now displayed in the reception room of the first mountain of Taihang forest farm. When the responsible person of the forest farm introduces the situation to visitors, they always explain this poem inscribed by Zhao Shuli in detail.

	Over the past 30 years, the oil pines on the first mountain of Taihang have grown vigorously and become even more pleasing. The area of planted trees has expanded to more than 200,000 mu. The first mountain of Taihang has now become a scenic spot in the Taihang Mountains, with very beautiful and attractive scenery.

### 赵树理题诗

　　赵树理题诗
    鲁兮
    “栉风沐雨种油松，日计无多岁计丰。莫道眼前犹似昨，重游过客识英雄。”这是著名作家赵树理同志给太行第一山题赠的一首诗。
    太行第一山在山西陵川县境内。１９５９年中共陵川县委决定，动员民兵两千人上山植树，绿化太行第一山。当时赵树理同志去陵川，认为山大石头多，树很难成活，表示不赞成。陵川县委书记邢德勇同志为了试验，坚持挖坎栽树不止。几年以后，赵树理同志又到陵川县，上山看到树均成活，绿荫盖地，一片生机，非常高兴，遂以“过客”身份，在满眼青山翠绿之下，信笔急书了这首诗，由衷地感谢和赞扬当年绿化太行第一山的决策人和植树人。
    这首诗现在陈列在太行第一山林场的接待室里，林场的负责人在给上山参观的人们介绍情况时，总要将赵树理同志题赠的这首诗，详细地加以介绍。
    ３０年来，太行第一山的油松，茁壮成长，更加喜人。植树面积扩大到２０多万亩。现在的太行第一山，已成为太行山的一景，风光十分秀美诱人。
