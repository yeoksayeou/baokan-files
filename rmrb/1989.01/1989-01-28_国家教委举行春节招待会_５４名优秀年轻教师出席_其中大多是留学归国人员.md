The State Education Commission held a Spring Festival reception. 54 outstanding young teachers attended, most of whom are returnees from studying abroad.

The People's Daily, Beijing, January 27th — Since the State Education Commission established the "Fund for Supporting Outstanding Young Teachers" in 1987, 200 teachers have received support, totaling 13 million yuan. A relevant official from the State Education Commission said at a meeting today that the work of supporting young teachers will continue and be done better.

In recent years, various colleges and universities have paid attention to selecting and training a group of young, outstanding backbone teachers to undertake various tasks of the school. Currently, there are 655 young professors under the age of 40 on the mainland and 3,960 associate professors under the age of 45. However, relevant officials from the State Education Commission admitted that the number of young professors and associate professors is still very small.

Today, 54 outstanding young teachers from some colleges and universities in Beijing were invited to attend the Spring Festival reception held by the State Education Commission. Most of them are returnees from studying abroad in recent years. State Councilor and Minister of the State Education Commission Li Tieying congratulated these young teachers on their achievements in their studies and work at the meeting. He said that the Commission will care for and support the growth of young teachers, pay attention to solving practical problems, and create more conditions to give full play to the talents of young teachers.

    近几年来，各高等院校比较注意选拔培养一批年轻的优秀骨干教师承担学校各项工作。目前，大陆有４０多岁的年轻教授６５５名，４５岁以下的副教授３９６０名。但国家教委有关负责人承认，年轻教授、副教授人数还是很少。
    北京部分高等院校的５４名优秀年轻教师今天应邀出席了国家教委举办的春节招待会，他们大部分是近年从国外留学归来的。国务委员、国家教委主任李铁映在会上祝贺这些年轻教师在学业上、工作上取得的成就，他表示，教委要关心、支持年轻教师的成长，注意解决实际问题，要创造更多的条件，发挥年轻教师的才智。
