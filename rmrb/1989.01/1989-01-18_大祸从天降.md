On the morning of the 15th, a mail express train heading to the capital Dhaka of Bangladesh was rushing through the railway tracks near the industrial city of Tongi. Suddenly, the train driver spotted another train approaching at high speed from the opposite direction. The driver immediately pulled the emergency brake, slightly reducing the speed of the train. The oncoming train also seemed to slow down. However, the immense momentum drove the two trains, each with 8 and 9 carriages respectively, into a head-on collision. At that moment, the clock showed 7:25 AM. The earth-shattering collision resulted in the most severe railway disaster in Bangladesh's history.

In recent days, Bangladesh's railways have been under heavy pressure from a surging passenger flow, with batches of travelers rushing to different places to participate in the annual religious festival. As the mail express train to Dhaka and the passenger train to Chittagong departed from their starting stations, passengers continued to rush into the carriages. The overcrowded trains carried approximately 3,000 passengers to the accident site, 45 kilometers away from Dhaka.

In the instant of the collision, passengers inside the carriages were thrown into chaos. Those on the roof of the carriages were all tossed to the ground. A group of soldiers, about 200 meters away from the accident site, were conducting winter military training and witnessed the scene. With the earth-shattering noise, the colliding train engines soared into the air, reaching a height of 15 feet. The engines were destroyed, and many carriages derailed and were severely damaged. Over a hundred bodies lay near the railway tracks. From the wrecked carriages, cries and screams echoed, and some passengers crawled out of the broken carriages and fled in all directions. More than 15,000 local residents near the accident site heard the massive collision noise and, unaware of what had happened, hurried back home and locked their doors.

The train collision accident shocked the relevant authorities in Bangladesh. The authorities immediately dispatched rescue teams to the accident site. The rescue teams found over 100 bodies on the spot and sent hundreds of injured people to nearby hospitals for emergency treatment. Bangladesh railway officials were still unclear about the exact number of passengers, fatalities, and injuries. According to the latest news this morning, at least 400 people have died, and more than 2,500 have been injured. Many of those sent to the hospital continue to die one after another.

The cause of the accident is still under investigation. The railway authorities initially determined that the railway signaling system caused this disaster.

After the train collision accident, President Ershad interrupted his inspection trip outside and, accompanied by his wife, went to the accident site to inspect the damage and comfort the injured.

　　大祸从天降
    １５日早晨，孟加拉国一列开往首都达卡的邮客快车正呼啸奔驰在工业城市栋吉附近的铁道线上。突然，火车司机发现正前方一列火车正高速迎面开来。司机随即紧拉紧急制动闸，火车稍稍减缓了速度。迎面开来的火车似乎也减低了速度。但是，巨大的惯性驱动着这两列分别有８节车厢和９节车厢的快车正面冲撞。此时，表针正指向７时２５分。震天动地的碰撞造成了孟加拉国铁路史上一次最严重的灾难。
    近日，孟加拉国铁路承受着滚滚客流的沉重压力，一批又一批的旅客正忙碌地赶赴异地参加一年一度的宗教节日。当开往达卡的邮客列车和开往吉大港的客车离开始发站后，旅客不断蜂拥进入车厢。车厢内人满为患，严重超载的两列列车把约３０００名旅客带到了距达卡４５公里的出事地。
    两列火车相撞的一刹那，车厢内人仰马翻，车厢顶上的人全部被掀飞到地。一群离出事地点２００多米处进行冬季军训的士兵目击，随着震天动地的声响，相撞的火车车头像气球一样冲向１５英尺高的空中，只见车头被毁，很多车厢脱轨并严重破损，上百人陈尸在铁路线附近。从破坏的车厢里传出嘈杂的哭喊声，一些旅客从车厢破口钻出向四处奔突。离出事地点不远的１５０００多当地居民，听到了列车相撞的巨大声响，不知发生了什么事，纷纷逃回家中闭门不出。
    火车相撞事故的发生使孟加拉国有关当局十分震惊。当局迅即派遣营救人员赶赴出事地点。营救人员当场发现了１００多具尸体，并将几百名受伤者送到附近医院抢救。孟加拉国铁路官员尚弄不清楚旅客、死亡者和受伤者的确切数字。据今晨最新消息，死亡者至少达４００人，受伤者达２５００多人。很多被送往医院的人仍在一个接一个死去。
    事故原因尚在调查。铁路当局初步断定，是铁路信号系统酿成这次大祸。
    火车相撞事故发生后，艾尔沙德总统中断在外地视察，携夫人前往出事地点视察灾情，慰问伤员。
