    The tax authorities in Xiagang, Hubei Province, have taken the initiative to rectify tax order from within, laying a solid foundation for law-based tax administration. Since last year, the region's tax authorities have focused on strengthening tax work by first examining internal issues within the system. They cross-verified all tax receipts issued in 1986 and 1987 with taxpayers, discovering that a few tax officials had falsified tax receipts and embezzled funds. The tax authorities did not shield these individuals and, based on the severity of their offenses, handed out appropriate disciplinary actions. A young tax official in Hanchuan County falsified tax receipts 108 times and embezzled nearly 100,000 yuan in tax revenue, and was handed over to judicial authorities by the county tax bureau for prosecution.

    Because the tax authorities first rectified themselves, they have been able to confidently and lawfully administer taxes in the process of rectifying tax order. By the end of last November, the entire region had investigated and handled 10,307 cases of tax evasion and underreporting, recovering and penalizing 2.726 million yuan in taxes.

　　孝感整顿税务秩序
    本报讯  湖北省孝感地区税务部门整顿税收秩序先从内部开刀，为依法治税打下了良好的基础。去年以来，这个地区税务部门在加强税收工作中，首先检查系统内部存在的问题。他们对全区１９８６年和１９８７年填开的税票与纳税人逐一进行了核对，发现少数税务干部在税票上弄虚作假，中饱私囊。税务机关不护短，根据情节对违纪者分别给予了处分。汉川县一个青年税务干部先后在税票上弄虚作假１０８次，贪污税款近万元，被县税务局移交司法机关处理。
    由于税务部门正人先正己，在整顿税收秩序中，能够理直气壮依法办税。截至去年１１月底，全地区共查处偷、漏税案件１０３０７起，补罚税款２７２．６万元。
