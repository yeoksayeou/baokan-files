To quickly build a satellite communications network, Europe is accelerating the development of its satellite communications industry.

New China News Agency, Paris, January 20th (Reporter Mao Ruiping) Due to the rapid development of television, radio, and communications industries, satellite communications lines in various European countries are already in short supply. To quickly meet the needs of users in various countries, the European Satellite Communications Organization recently signed a contract with the French Aerospace Company to expedite the delivery of 4 communication satellites.

A statement issued by the European Satellite Communications Organization in Paris today pointed out that after signing this contract, it can advance the completion of a European communications network by the end of 1991, consisting of the two currently operational "Eutelsat 1" satellites and these 4 "Eutelsat 2" satellites.

The 4 "Eutelsat 2" satellites have medium power. The contract stipulates that the first "Eutelsat 2" satellite will be delivered by the end of this year, launched into orbit next spring, and the other 3 will be launched into orbit at intervals of 6 months after the first one. After these satellites are put into operation, they can basically meet the needs of the entire European television, radio, telephone, and other sectors.

Considering the future development of the communications industry, the European Satellite Communications Organization will also order the 5th "Eutelsat 2" satellite in February this year, with plans to put it into operation by 1992.

　　为尽快建成卫星通讯网
    欧洲加速开发卫星通讯事业
    新华社巴黎１月２０日电（记者茅瑞清）由于电视、广播、通讯事业的迅速发展，欧洲各国的卫星通讯线路已供不应求。为尽快满足各国用户的需要，欧洲卫星通讯组织最近同法国航空与航天工业公司签订了一个关于加快交付４颗通讯卫星的合同。
    欧洲卫星通讯组织今天在巴黎发表的一项公报指出，这个合同签订后，它就可以提前在１９９１年年底前建成一个由目前已投入使用的两颗“厄泰尔萨特”１号卫星和这４颗“厄泰尔萨特”２号卫星组成的欧洲通讯网。
    这４颗“厄泰尔萨特”２号卫星功率属中等。合同规定，第一颗２号卫星将在今年年底交货，明年春天被送入轨道，其他３颗将在第一颗上天后每隔６个月被分别送进轨道。这些卫星投入运行后就可基本上满足整个欧洲的电视、广播、电话等部门的需要。
    考虑到今后通讯事业的发展，欧洲卫星通讯组织在今年２月还将订购第５颗“厄泰尔萨特”２号卫星，准备到１９９２年投入运行。
