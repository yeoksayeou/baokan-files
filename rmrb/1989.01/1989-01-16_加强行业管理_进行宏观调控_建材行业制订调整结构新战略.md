In the context of the state's reduction in construction scale, the building materials industry has taken proactive measures by proposing a new policy for the development of the building materials industry over the next period: adjusting the industry structure.

The ongoing National Building Materials Bureau Directors' Meeting in Beijing elaborated on this policy. Compared to other industries, the building materials industry has the closest relationship with the scale of fixed asset investments. Reducing the scale of fixed assets means that the total social demand for building materials products will sharply decrease, which will inevitably affect the utilization of the existing production capacity of the building materials industry. If some small and medium-sized building materials enterprises do not timely adjust and reform, they will face a difficult situation.

The meeting predicts that over the next two years, with the implementation of the state's adjustment policies, a relatively relaxed market environment will emerge. The building materials industry should seize this opportunity to adjust the internal structure of the industry.

In his speech, Wang Yanmu, a leader of the State Building Materials Bureau, emphasized: Adjusting the internal structure of the building materials industry includes adjusting the scale of enterprises, product structure, and technological structure. He believes that strengthening industry management and implementing macroeconomic control are important means of structural adjustment. He proposed that building materials management departments at all levels should seriously follow the state's regulations, clearly propose the list of supported and restricted building materials products, formulate and issue economic scale standards, technological economic standards, obsolete product catalogs, and restricted import product catalogs for building materials enterprises. For those enterprises with poor management and low economic benefits, adjustments can be made through trial mergers, conversion, and auction of property rights.

He believes that establishing and developing enterprise groups is also an important way of structural adjustment. Developing export-oriented production is also an important means of structural adjustment. He proposed that while meeting domestic market demand, we should actively develop export-oriented production to drive the building materials industry to a higher level.

### 加强行业管理　进行宏观调控  建材行业制订调整结构新战略

　　加强行业管理　进行宏观调控
    建材行业制订调整结构新战略
    据新华社北京１月１５日电  （记者顾洪洪）在国家压缩基建规模的情况下，建材行业未雨绸缪，适时提出今后一个时期建材工业发展的方针：调整行业结构。
    正在北京召开的全国建材局长会议对这一方针进行了阐述。同其它行业相比，建材行业与固定资产投资规模的依存关系最为密切。压缩固定资产规模，意味着建材产品的社会总需求量将急剧下降，这对建材工业已形成的生产能力的发挥不能不带来影响，一些中小建材企业如不适时调整改革，将面临难以为继的局面。
    会议预计，今明两年内，随着国家调整政策的实施，将出现相对宽松的市场环境，建材行业应抓住这一时机，进行行业内部的结构调整。
    国家建材局负责人王燕谋在讲话中强调：调整建材行业内部结构，包括企业规模、产品结构和技术结构的调整。他认为加强行业管理、进行宏观调控，是调整结构的一个重要手段。他提出，各级建材主管部门要认真按照国家规定，提出明确支持和限制的建材产品细目，制定和发布建材企业规模经济标准、技术经济标准、淘汰产品目录、限制进口产品目录。对那些经营管理不善、经济效益不好的企业，可以通过试行兼并、转产、拍卖产权等方式进行调整。
    他认为组建发展企业集团，也是结构调整的一个重要方式。发展外向型生产也是结构调整的一个重要手段。他提出要在满足国内市场需求的同时，积极发展外向型生产，带动建材工业上水平。
