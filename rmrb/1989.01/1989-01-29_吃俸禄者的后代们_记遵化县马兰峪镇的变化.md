Many people know about the Eastern Qing Tombs, but few know about Malanyu. In fact, the Eastern Tombs are located in Malanyu Town.

Malanyu is considered a place of auspicious geography. During the 267 years of the Qing Dynasty's rule, five emperors, 15 empresses, and 136 concubines, princesses, and other royal figures were buried here.

Since the construction of the imperial tombs in Malanyu Town, the local people have been designated as royal tomb guardians, generation after generation enjoying the privilege of receiving salaries, "three pecks of grain per person per month, five taels of gold for a son, three taels of gold for a daughter," becoming a hereditary privilege. Therefore, they did not farm the land, nor did they have the habit of working or engaging in commerce. After the Qing Dynasty was overthrown, the royal stipends were cut off, and the people here began to sell ancient trees for a living. Their lives worsened year by year.

After the founding of New China, the State Council listed the Eastern Tombs as a national key cultural relic protection unit. The people of Malanyu mostly engaged in agricultural production. However, the good times did not last long. Under the "leftist" line, felling trees for steel smelting and destroying forests to create farmland severely damaged this "auspicious land" of green mountains, clear waters, and fragrant flowers and fruits. The people of Malanyu, holding a golden bowl but with no food to eat, had an average living standard of less than 70 yuan until 1978. It was only after the implementation of the reform and opening-up policy that they truly moved from guarding their ancestral profession to pioneering and creating new businesses.

		From Eating Imperial Rations to Making Contributions

It is still the same piece of land, but after the implementation of the household contract responsibility system, good crops were grown. The grain yield per mu, which was previously around 100 kilograms, has now reached 500 kilograms. Each year, 250,000 kilograms of grain are sold to the state, ending the history of eating imperial rations during the imperial era and state-subsidized grain after liberation.

With abundant grain, the enthusiasm of the people for raising pigs has increased. In the past two years, more than 4,500 fattened pigs have been sold each year, more than doubling the number in 1978.

Fruit is a major economic pillar here. The number of fruit trees in the town increased from 80,000 in 1978 to 580,000 in 1988, with a total production of 900,000 kilograms of fresh and dried fruit products.

Wang Haifeng, who once worked for the Japanese imperialists, is now a leading figure in poverty alleviation and wealth creation. In 1979, Wang Haifeng, then the secretary of the Nanjiyao Village Party Branch, organized four households to be the first to find mining points in the mountain gully and start gold mining, earning more than 100,000 yuan that year. The allure of gold attracted the entire village, and in 1980, 94 out of the 97 households in this small mountain village engaged in gold mining. This single item alone increased the per capita income by more than 700 yuan.

The town government took active supportive measures, strengthening management on one hand and providing services for gold miners on the other, such as electricity, loans, and organizing labor. Since 1984, the town has cumulatively turned over 6,618 taels of gold to the state. Gold income accounts for 30% of the town's total income, and the per capita living standard has increased by more than 400 yuan from gold mining alone.

		Planning for Future Generations, Planting Everlasting Businesses

The gold resources are almost exhausted, and now that people are wealthy, what will future generations rely on? This is a new question that the people of Malanyu are considering.

In 1983, when the "gold rush" was just beginning in the entire town, farmer Li Sheng (now the president of the town's economic cooperative) took the initiative to contract 40 mu of barren mountain land, planting 1,500 chestnut and red fruit trees, most of which are now bearing fruit. All gold miners admire his foresight. Following his lead, people rushed to invest their gold mining income in developing fruit trees, planting everlasting businesses for future generations. Just the people of four villages in the town invested 110,000 yuan, and within a year, built a 100-mu dense early-ripening fruit orchard on the barren land after gold mining; this year, they invested another 20,000 yuan to build a drip irrigation system in the orchard.

The town government took encouraging measures, and for every fruit tree planted by the people, the collective provided a subsidy of 2 jiao. In recent years, the town's total investment in forestry has been approximately 1.5 million yuan.

		Utilizing the Advantage of the Imperial Tombs, Borrowing External Capital to Get Rich

During the "leftist" era, few people came to tour the Eastern Tombs. Now, the number of tourists is increasing. The people of Malanyu also found a way: why not utilize the advantage of the imperial tombs and make money from tourism?

Farmer Wang Yuxiang, a descendant of generations who ate salaries, dared to open the first private small oil mill in 1978, selling his own produced small mill fragrant oil in the tourist area, earning more than a thousand yuan in a year. Tasting the sweetness, he then opened a woodworking factory, a tent factory... and got rich.

With the imperial tombs attracting visitors, it seems that doing business is not difficult. The people of Malanyu have entered the door of commerce. They opened hotels, restaurants, sold cold drinks, provided services, built shops... By 1987, the town had developed more than 600 individual industrial and commercial households, with 2,700 people engaged in the business, earning a total income of more than 14 million yuan per year. Young Sun Xiaowu became a hardware and electrical appliances boss with tens of millions of yuan.

The town cadres' awareness of commodities is also increasing, developing commodity economy around tourism. They raised funds to successively establish 14 joint-stock enterprises, including an automobile parts factory, a plastic packaging factory, a steel window factory, and an ancient architecture team, with an annual output value of more than 6 million yuan and a profit of more than 700,000 yuan.

In the imperial era, although the people of Malanyu guarded the tombs for the feudal dynasty, they had an inexplicable sense of superiority. After the feudal dynasty was overthrown, they felt inferior due to poverty. Now, in the era of reform, the descendants of Malanyu have updated their ideas and spiritual outlook. From guarding their ancestral profession, abandoning agriculture, looking down on commerce, and giving up work, to engaging in agriculture, commerce, industry, and services, doesn't this reflect the changes of the times!

Of course, one point must be noted: apart from the Eastern Tombs, there is not much else to attract people. Why? Opinions vary. This is a problem that local leaders should seriously consider.

　　吃俸禄者的后代们——记遵化县马兰峪镇的变化
    张春辉　万广军　尹韵秋　魏亚玲
    知道清东陵的人多，知道马兰峪的人却不多。其实，东陵就在马兰峪镇。
    马兰峪被看成是块风水宝地。清王朝统治２６７年，在这里共埋葬５个皇帝，１５个皇后，１３６个妃、嫔、公主等。
    从皇陵建在马兰峪镇那时开始，这里的人们都被定为皇家的守陵人，祖祖辈辈衣食享有俸禄，“大小口月三斗，生男黄金五两，育女黄金三两”，成为世袭的一种特权。因此，他们不种地，更没有做工经商的习惯。清王朝被推翻后，断了皇粮等俸禄，这里的人便以卖古树为生。日子一年不如一年。
    新中国成立后，国务院把东陵列为全国重点文物保护单位。马兰峪人大都从事起农业生产。但好景不长，在“左”的路线下，伐木炼钢，毁林造田，使山青水秀、花果飘香的这块“风水宝地”又遭到了严重破坏。马兰峪人捧着金碗没饭吃，直到１９７８年以前人均生活水平不足７０元。他们真正从守祖业走向开拓创业，还是实行改革以后的事。
    　　　　昔日吃皇粮　如今作贡献
    还是这块土地，“大包干”后却种出了好庄稼。粮食过去亩产１００公斤左右，现在已达到５００公斤。每年向国家交售定购粮２５万公斤，结束了王朝时吃皇粮、解放后吃国家返销粮的历史。
    粮多，群众养猪的积极性高。近两年，每年出栏肥猪达４５００多头，比１９７８年翻了一番多。
    林果是这里的一大经济支柱。全镇果树１９７８年仅８万多棵，１９８８年发展到５８万多棵，干鲜果品总产９０多万公斤。
    昔日给日本帝国主义当过劳工的王海丰，如今成了脱贫致富的带头人。１９７９年，原任南吉峪村党支部书记的王海丰，组织本村４户群众率先到山沟里找矿点，搞起了采金，当年收入上万元。黄金诱惑了全村人，１９８０年，这个只有９７户人家的小山村，就有９４户搞采金。仅此一项，人均收入７００多元。
    镇政府采取积极扶持措施，一方面加强管理，一方面为采金者搞好服务，提供电力、贷款和组织劳务。从１９８４年以来，全镇累计共上交国家黄金６６１８两。黄金收入占全镇总收入的３０％，仅采金一项，人均生活水平提高４００多元。
    　　　　为计子孙事　再植千秋业
    黄金资源采得差不多了，现在人富裕起来，将来子孙后代靠什么？这是马兰峪人思虑的新问题。
    农民李生（现任镇经济联合社社长），１９８３年“采金热”在全镇刚刚兴起的时候，他就承包了本村没人包的４０多亩山场，栽上１５００棵板栗树和红果树，现在大多已挂果。所有采金者无不说他有眼光。在他的带动下，人们纷纷把采金收入用来发展果树，为子孙后代再植千秋业。仅该镇四村的群众就投资１１万元，一年之内在采金后的废地上建起１００亩密植早丰果园；今年又投资２万元，在果园里搞了滴灌工程。
    镇政府采取鼓励措施，群众每栽一棵果树，集体给补助２角钱。近几年来，全镇林业总投资约１５０万元。
    　　　　用皇陵优势　借外财致富
    在“左”的年代里，来东陵旅游的人寥寥无几。如今游人日益增多。马兰峪人也开了窍门：何不借皇陵优势，靠旅游生财。
    农民王玉祥，这个祖祖辈辈吃俸禄的后生，１９７８年大着胆子办起第一个私营小油场，把自己生产的小磨香油拿到旅游区出售，一年就赚回上千元。尝到了甜头，接着又办起木器厂、篷布厂……发了。
    守着人来人往的皇陵，生意经似乎并不难念，马兰峪人入了经商的门儿。他们围绕东陵，开旅馆，办饭店，卖冷饮，搞服务，建商店……到１９８７年，全镇个体工商户已发展到６００多户，从业人员２７００多人，每年总收入达１４００多万元。青年孙小五成了腰缠几十万元的五金交电老板。
    镇干部们的商品意识也日益增强，围绕旅游发展商品经济。设法集资先后办起汽车配件厂、塑料包装厂、钢窗厂、古建筑队等１４个股份制企业，年产值６００多万元，创利润７０多万元。
    马兰峪人，在帝制时代，虽为封建王朝看陵守穴，却有莫名其妙的优越感。封建王朝被推翻后，又因贫穷而产生了自卑感。如今改革时代，马兰峪的后代们，思想观念和精神面貌更新了。从守祖业、撂农、轻商、弃工，到务农、经商、兴工、搞服务，这不正反映了时代的变迁吗！
    当然，还要指出一点，这里除了东陵外，还不那么吸引人。为什么？说法不一。这是值得当地领导认真思考的问题。
