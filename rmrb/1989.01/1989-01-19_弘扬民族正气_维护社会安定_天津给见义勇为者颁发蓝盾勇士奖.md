Heroes from Guangzhou, Tianjin, and Dandong gathered at the Tianjin Municipal Officials' Club this morning to receive the first-ever Blue Shield Hero Award from a Chinese civilian organization.

The Blue Shield Hero Award and the Blue Shield Special Hero Award, which are open to the entire nation, were established by the Tianjin-based Blue Shield Magazine in 1988. These awards are given to individuals who voluntarily protect national interests, safeguard the safety of the nation and its people, and uphold social stability and the dignity of the law. They are awarded to those who act bravely in the face of injustice, stand up for what is right, fear no evil, and risk their lives to fight against lawbreakers. The Blue Shield Special Hero Award is given to those who have made outstanding contributions by risking their lives to protect national interests, national security, and the safety of people's lives and property. These awards are selected annually. In addition to receiving a certificate of honor, the awardees are given cash prizes ranging from 3,000 to 10,000 yuan. It is understood that this is the first time in China that a civilian organization has voluntarily awarded prizes to heroes who act bravely in the face of injustice.

The "Guardian Angel of Guangzhou," who fought bravely against six criminals and sacrificed his life, Guangzhou Armed Police soldier Che Mengyi, and Tianjin Public Security Bureau officer Liu Ying, who solved hundreds of major criminal cases and sacrificed his life in the line of duty, were awarded the Blue Shield Special Hero Award. Anhu Province Bengbu City lawyer Wang Gong, Liaoning Province Dandong Daily female journalist Tan Zhaoping, Tianjin Public Security Bureau police officer Yang Jinhai, and Tianjin Donghai Taxi Company driver Li Fusheng were awarded the Blue Shield Hero Award.

The list of this year's award winners was recommended by various sectors of society, verified, and selected by the Blue Shield Magazine. The award ceremony was generously sponsored by Mr. Li Ning, General Manager of Tianjin Huamei Limited Company.

    本报天津１月１８日电  记者肖荻、舒瑜报道：来自广州、天津、丹东等地的护法英雄，今天上午聚集在天津市干部俱乐部，接受我国民间团体首次颁发的蓝盾勇士奖。
    面向全国的蓝盾勇士奖和蓝盾勇士特别奖，是天津《蓝盾》杂志社于１９８８年设立的。对自觉维护民族利益，保护国家和人民的安危，为了社会安定和法律尊严，见义勇为，刚正不阿，不畏强暴，舍身同违法分子作殊死斗争的勇士，授予蓝盾勇士奖。对赴汤蹈火，视死如归，以弥天大勇捍卫民族利益、国家安危，保卫人民生命财产安全，作出杰出贡献的勇士，授予蓝盾勇士特别奖。该奖每年评选一次。对获奖者，除发给荣誉证书外，分别发给３０００元至１万元的奖金。据了解，民间团体自发地为见义勇为的勇士们颁奖，这在我国还是第一次。
