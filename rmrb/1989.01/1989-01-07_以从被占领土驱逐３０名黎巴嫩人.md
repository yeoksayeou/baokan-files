	Israeli forces today expelled approximately 30 Lebanese residents from several small towns in the southern part of Lebanon that they occupy.

	According to the Lebanese "Voice of the Homeland" radio station, the expelled residents have arrived in the Lebanese city of Sidon. One of the expelled Lebanese told the radio station that Israeli forces attacked four Lebanese small towns within the "security zone" established by Israel, forcing the residents to leave their homes.

	In 1983, Israel, under the pretext of preventing the infiltration of Palestinian guerrillas, forcibly established a "security zone" in the southern part of Lebanon that it occupies. There are 85 Lebanese villages within this "security zone."

　　以从被占领土驱逐３０名黎巴嫩人
    新华社贝鲁特１月５日电  以色列军队今天从其占领的黎巴嫩南部的一些小镇驱逐了约３０名黎巴嫩居民。
    据黎巴嫩“祖国之声”电台报道，被驱逐的居民已抵达黎巴嫩赛达城。一位被驱逐的黎巴嫩人对这家电台说，以色列军队袭击了以色列建立的“安全带”内的４个黎巴嫩小镇，强迫居民离开家园。
    １９８３年以色列以防止巴勒斯坦游击队渗入为借口，在其占领的黎巴嫩南部强行建立了“安全带”，有８５个黎巴嫩村庄陷落在“安全带”内。
