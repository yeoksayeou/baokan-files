The death toll from the earthquake in Tajikistan has reached 1,000.

According to TASS, the earthquake occurred at 2:02 AM Moscow time today. The epicenter had a magnitude of 7.0 and was located about 30 kilometers southwest of Dushanbe, the capital of Tajikistan, in the Gissar region. This area is densely populated and primarily agricultural. The villages of Shorloq, Kulob, and Okulobod suffered the heaviest losses. The earthquake triggered two massive landslides in nearby hills.

Currently, the Tajikistan government is leading local residents in relief efforts. Rescue teams from Dushanbe and surrounding areas have been dispatched to the disaster zone. Heavy machinery, including excavators, bulldozers, and cranes, are being transported to the affected areas.

January 23, 1989, a magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck the Tajikistan Soviet Socialist Republic, causing buildings to collapse and resulting in casualties. The epicenter was located about 50 kilometers southwest of Dushanbe in the village of Shorloq. The image shows a large fissure in the ground caused by the earthquake.
