	Lech Walesa, the former chairman of Poland's Solidarity Trade Union, stated on the 5th in Gdansk to reporters that he will participate in the "round table conference" convened by the Polish government.

	The "round table conference" was proposed by the Polish authorities in August of last year, aiming to seek "constructive opposition" to work together with the authorities to discuss national affairs. However, due to serious disagreements between the two sides on participants and discussion topics, the "round table conference" has not been held to this day. Previously, Walesa had expressed his willingness to make concessions, but this is the first time he has explicitly announced his readiness to participate in the "round table conference."

　　瓦文萨准备参加政府圆桌会议
    波兰前团结工会主席瓦文萨五日在格但斯克对记者表示，他将参加波政府举行的“圆桌会议”。
    “圆桌会议”是波兰当局去年八月提议召开的，旨在争取“建设性反对派”同当局一道共商国是。但因双方在参加人员和讨论内容等方面存在严重分歧，“圆桌会议”迄今一直未能召开。此前瓦文萨已表示愿做出妥协，但如此明确宣布准备参加“圆桌会议”，还是第一次。
