The People Call for Justice – A Record of the "Lu Zhong Car Group"

    The question “Should the ‘Lu Zhong Car Group’ sign still be displayed?” was publicly raised by the *An Hui Daily* on January 7. On January 14, the *China Youth Daily* reprinted this article and published a short commentary titled “Government and Citizens, Please Give an Answer.” This sparked a massive response in Anhui and across the nation. To verify the facts, on January 20, the reporter accompanied Hefei City Mayor Zhong Yong San on a visit to the "Lu Zhong Car Group" and also visited Lu Zhong's parents and sisters.

    The sign for the "Lu Zhong Car Group" was earned by the outstanding conductor Lu Zhong on February 19, 1987, when he fought against criminals, sacrificing his blood and life. After Lu Zhong's heroic death, his sister Lu Hong took over his position on October 1, 1987, to continue his legacy. People with a sense of justice who board this bus cannot help but feel respect. However, a small group of thugs always direct their hatred towards Lu Hong and her car group.

    Last spring, a few young hooligans boarded the bus and pointed at Lu Hong, cursing: "You lost one brother, isn't that enough? Do you want to lose another...".

    Last autumn, three troublemakers, just as they were about to get off the bus, suddenly punched Lu Hong in the head, and another grabbed her hair and punched her again...

    Last winter, two young women suddenly struck Lu Hong in the face, knocking her to the ground inside the bus. Lu Hong's face was scratched, and her lower abdomen was kicked, and she has not yet recovered...

    Mayor Zhong tightly held Lu Hong's hand, saying: "You have suffered. You have been harassed, insulted, and even beaten by thugs time and time again. This is our government's failure to protect you..." At this point, Mayor Zhong became very emotional: "I have an idea. The spirit of Lu Zhong should first be carried on by me, the mayor, and it is the responsibility of all the people of Hefei. We can no longer let you and your family bear this risk alone. I have already requested the public security, procuratorate, courts, and the entire society to protect the 'Lu Zhong Car Group' and your entire family..."

    The fair-faced, clean, yet worried-looking Lu Hong listened to Mayor Zhong's words for a long time without speaking, tears welling up in her eyes. Later, she spoke in a very low voice, expressing her heartfelt thoughts: "The people of Hefei are very good. They always line up before boarding the bus. The troublemakers are only a few. I love our car group from the bottom of my heart. If I had to leave it, I would really miss it, but my poor mother..."

    Lu Hong's mother, Li Yu Xian, is 53 years old. When Mayor Zhong met this heroic mother with her head full of white hair, he asked her what her wishes were. She said: "I thought that after my son's death, society would be peaceful, and I would not cry too much. Who would have thought that my daughter would also suffer? When will my tears stop flowing?"

    Lu Zhong's father, Lu Rui Ping, has been driving a car for decades. Even now, he still drives to the train station every night to pick up and drop off passengers. He has hope that the government can maintain social order. He said, as long as everyone from top to bottom works together, and every family manages it, it can be done well. It is absolutely not acceptable to crack down only after an incident like the "Lu Zhong Incident" and then relax again after the incident is over...

    What they said is exactly what the people are calling for. In recent days, local newspapers and radio stations have published many letters from the public demanding the punishment of evil-doers and firmly insisting that the sign of the "Lu Zhong Car Group" should be displayed for a long time.

    At 11 AM, it was the peak hour for public buses. The reporter, along with Mayor Zhong, boarded the "Lu Zhong Car Group" bus as ordinary passengers. Perhaps due to the power of public opinion, or perhaps because of Hefei City Government's determination to keep the sign displayed, although there were many passengers, the order was maintained. The driver, Pei Xi Lin, and the conductor, Sun Jia Hong, always wore smiles on their faces, traveling back and forth on the 14-kilometer public transportation route.

　　人民呼唤正义
    ——“陆忠车组”随行录
    本报记者  张振国
    《“陆忠车组”的牌子还要不要挂？》，《安徽日报》于１月７日公开向社会提出这一问题。１月１４日，《中国青年报》转载了此文，并发表了《政府、公民，请作出回答》的短评。这在安徽，乃至全国引起巨大反响。为究虚实，记者于１月２０日陪同合肥市市长钟咏三随“陆忠车组”跑了一趟，并到陆忠家里看望了他的双亲和姐妹。
    “陆忠车组”的牌子，是优秀乘务员陆忠于１９８７年２月１９日和罪犯作斗争，用鲜血和生命换来的。陆忠的姐姐陆红，为继承弟弟的事业，在陆忠壮烈牺牲后的１９８７年１０月１日走上了弟弟的岗位。怀有正义感的人们坐上此车，无不肃然起敬。可是，有一小撮歹徒，总是把仇恨的眼光盯着陆红和她所在的车组。
    去年春天，有几个小流氓一上车就指着陆红的鼻子大骂：你死了个弟弟还不够，还想再死一个……
    去年秋天，有３个坏家伙，在临下车时，一个突然朝她的头部猛打一拳，另一个抓住她的头发又是一拳……
    去年冬天，有两年轻妇女，突然向陆红面部猛击过来，把她打倒在车内。陆红的脸被抓破，下腹被踢伤，至今尚未痊愈……
    钟市长紧紧握着陆红的手，说：“你受苦了，你一次又一次地被歹徒刁难、辱骂，以至被打伤，这是我们政府没有保护好……”说到此时，钟市长十分激动：“我有一个想法，陆忠精神的继承，首先是我这个市长要带头继承，是全市人民的事，我们再也不能让你一人、一家来承担这个风险，我已要求公检法司及全社会来保护‘陆忠车组’和你们全家……”
    清秀、白净而又面带愁容的陆红，听了钟市长的话，久久没有开口，只是泪水在眼中转动。后来她用很低的话语，吐出她的心声：“我们合肥人民是非常好的，他们上车之前，始终坚持排队，坏家伙只是少数，我打心里爱我们车组，要是离开它，我真舍不得，但我可怜的妈妈……”她再也说不下去了。
    陆红的母亲李玉霞，今年５３岁。钟市长见到这位满头白发的英雄母亲，问她有什么要求，她说：“我原想忠儿走了，能换来社会安宁，也就不多哭了。谁知红儿又遭毒手，我的泪水何时能不淌呢？”
    陆忠的父亲陆瑞平，已开了几十年的汽车。直到现在还是每天晚上专跑火车站接送旅客。他对政府有能力搞好社会治安是怀着希望的。他说，只要上上下下一起抓，千家万户一起管，总是能搞得好的。万万不能出了个“陆忠事件”才抓一阵，事件一过又放松……
    他们所说的，正是人民所呼唤的。连日来，当地报纸、电台发表了很多人民群众要求惩治邪恶的来信，坚决要求“陆忠车组”的牌子要长期挂下去。
    上午１１时，是公共汽车的人流高峰期。记者随钟市长以普通乘客的身份，坐上了“陆忠车组”的车。也许是慑于舆论的威力，也许是合肥市政府要把这块牌子挂到底的决心安定了人心，上车的人虽然很多，但秩序井然。司机裴锡林、乘务员孙家红，始终是面带微笑，往返行驶在１４公里的公共交通线上。
