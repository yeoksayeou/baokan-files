Edition: 2

The eight key economic indicators regularly released are as follows:

1. **Fixed Asset Investment Amount**: This refers to the monetary value of the work done to construct and purchase fixed assets, as well as related expenses. The content of fixed asset investment is diverse. Some require construction and installation work, some require the purchase of equipment, tools, instruments, and commercial buildings, and others require necessary preparatory and management work. The fixed asset investment amount is calculated based on the actual completion of engineering quantities and settlement prices during the reporting period, plus the value of purchased equipment and commercial buildings, and other expenses incurred. It is a comprehensive indicator reflecting the scale, speed, and investment proportion of fixed asset investment, serving as an important basis for the state to formulate investment plans and control investment scales. Investment demand is a major component of total social demand, making the fixed asset investment amount an important indicator for studying the balance of total social supply and demand.

Currently, the published data is the cumulative fixed asset investment amount completed by state-owned enterprises for basic construction and renovation from the beginning of the year to the reporting month.

2. **Bank Loan Balance and Increase**: The bank loan balance refers to the amount of loans that banks have lent to enterprises, institutions, and individuals that have not been repaid by the end of the reporting period. The increase in the bank loan balance is the difference between the loan balance at the end of the current period and the beginning of the period. The bank loan balance and its increase are important economic indicators for the state to observe the scale of credit and the operation of loans, serving as an important basis for the state to formulate financial policies and conduct macroeconomic control of funds.

Currently, the published data includes the loan balances and increases of the People's Bank of China, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Agricultural Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and China International Trust and Investment Corporation (excluding the data for Bank of Communications and China International Trust and Investment Corporation in regions other than Shenzhen).

3. **Total Wages of Employees**: This refers to the total labor remuneration paid by various units to all employees during the reporting period. It includes time-based wages, piecework wages, base wages, position-based wages, various bonuses, various allowances, overtime pay, and other wages. Any labor remuneration paid to employees based on the quantity and quality of their work, as well as other wages and allowances paid according to state laws and policies, regardless of whether they are paid from the wage account or other expense accounts (such as handling fees, material fees, processing fees, employee welfare funds, enterprise retained profits, and business income of affiliated units), and regardless of whether they are paid in monetary or in-kind form, are all included in the total wage amount. The total wages of employees are an important component of the consumption fund, and this indicator is crucial for studying distribution policies, the balance of supply and demand for consumer goods, and the living standards of employees.

Currently, the published data is the cumulative total wages paid to employees by state-owned enterprises, urban collective-owned enterprises, and various joint ventures from the beginning of the year to the reporting month.

4. **Industrial Full-Time Labor Productivity**: This refers to the value of products produced by the average employee in an industrial enterprise within a unit of time, reflecting the relationship between labor consumption and labor results. It is a comprehensive indicator of the enterprise's production technology level, management level, employee technical proficiency, and labor enthusiasm, and is an important indicator for assessing the labor efficiency of industrial enterprises. The calculation formula is provided in Note 1.

All employees refer to various personnel working in industrial enterprises and receiving wages from industrial enterprises, including permanent employees, contract employees, and other employees, but excluding employees of construction departments funded by construction costs. The average number of employees is the average number of employees during the reporting period, calculated by dividing the sum of the monthly average number of employees by the number of months; the monthly average number of employees is calculated by dividing the sum of the actual number of employees on each day of the month by the number of calendar days in the month, or by dividing the sum of the number of employees at the beginning and end of the month by 2.

Industrial total output value refers to the total value of industrial products produced by industrial enterprises during the reporting period. It includes the value of finished products, industrial service value, and the value of self-manufactured semi-finished products and work-in-progress at the beginning and end of the period. To eliminate the influence of price changes and facilitate comparison between different periods, the industrial total output value is calculated using comparable prices.

Currently, the published data is the full-time labor productivity of state-owned independent accounting industrial enterprises.

5. **Industrial Sales Profit and Tax Rate**: This refers to the ratio of the total profit and tax amount realized by industrial enterprises during the reporting period to the total sales revenue of all products during the same period, which is the profit and tax realized for every 100 yuan of sales revenue. Profit and tax are the surplus after deducting costs and expenses from the sales revenue, and the lower the cost, the higher the surplus. Therefore, the industrial sales profit and tax rate is an important indicator reflecting the management level and economic benefits of industrial enterprises. The calculation formula is provided in Note 2.

Product sales revenue refers to the revenue obtained by enterprises from selling products, self-manufactured semi-finished products, and providing industrial services to external parties.

Realized profit refers to the total profit amount realized by the enterprise, including the fixed capital occupation fee and circulating capital occupation fee that enterprises implementing the paid use of funds method should pay from the sales revenue according to regulations; taxes refer to the product sales tax that enterprises should pay for the sold goods, including the product tax, value-added tax, business tax, urban maintenance and construction tax paid by enterprises, and the resource tax that should be paid for the sold products, etc.

Currently, the published data is the sales profit and tax rate of state-owned budgetary industrial enterprises.

6. **Industrial Fund Profit and Tax Rate**: This refers to the ratio of the total profit and tax amount realized by industrial enterprises during the reporting period to the average balance of all funds (net value of fixed assets and quota circulating funds) during the same period, which is the profit and tax realized for every 100 yuan of funds. It is an important indicator that comprehensively reflects the management level and fund utilization effect of enterprises. To improve the fund profit and tax rate, not only should more profit and tax be realized, but also less funds should be occupied, so evaluating this indicator helps promote enterprises to save fund occupation and accelerate fund turnover. The calculation formula is provided in Note 3.

Quota circulating funds refer to the minimum amount of circulating funds that industrial enterprises need to maintain according to their financial plans, including reserve funds, production funds, finished product funds, excess inventory, and loss of liquid assets under processing. The net value of fixed assets refers to the net value after deducting the accumulated depreciation from the original value of fixed assets. The average balance of quota circulating funds and the average balance of the net value of fixed assets during the reporting period are both calculated by dividing the sum of the average balances of each month by the number of months.

The total profit and tax amount realized during the reporting period within a year is the cumulative total profit and tax amount realized by each month during the reporting period. To address the issue of varying lengths of reporting periods and facilitate comparison of data from different reporting periods, the cumulative total profit and tax amount realized by each month during the reporting period must be multiplied by 12 divided by the cumulative number of months, converting it into an annual figure.

Currently, the published data is the fund profit and tax rate of state-owned budgetary industrial enterprises.

7. **Industrial Comparable Product Cost Reduction Rate**: Comparable products refer to products that were officially produced last year and are still being produced this year. The comparable product cost reduction rate refers to the percentage change in the cost of comparable products produced during the reporting period compared to the same period last year. Product costs are composed of production costs such as raw materials, fuel, power, and wages. The comparable product cost reduction rate generally reflects the economic benefits of saving material and labor consumption in the industrial production process. However, it is affected by price changes, and when the price increase of raw materials and other items is significant, it often appears as an increase in comparable product costs (the increase rate is represented by a negative number). The calculation formula is provided in Note 4.

In the formula, the numerator is the total cost incurred by the enterprise for producing comparable products during the current period, and the denominator is the total cost calculated by multiplying the production quantity of various comparable products during the current period by the actual average unit cost of the same period last year.

Currently, the published data is the comparable product cost reduction rate of state-owned budgetary industrial enterprises.

8. **Industrial Comprehensive Energy Consumption Reduction Rate**: This refers to the percentage change in the energy consumption per 10,000 yuan of industrial total output value (calculated using comparable prices) during the reporting period compared to the same period last year. The energy consumption per 10,000 yuan of industrial total output value indicates the amount of various types of energy consumed by the enterprise to complete 10,000 yuan of output value (converted into standard coal). By comparing the energy consumption per 10,000 yuan of industrial total output value between two periods, it is possible to comprehensively reflect the economic benefits of energy conservation in industrial enterprises. The calculation formula is provided in Note 5.

Currently, the published data is the comprehensive energy consumption reduction rate of county-level and above state-owned and collective-owned industrial enterprises.

**Note 1**: Industrial Full-Time Labor Productivity (yuan/person) = Industrial total output value calculated using comparable prices during the reporting period / Average number of all employees in industrial enterprises during the reporting period

**Note 2**: Industrial Sales Profit and Tax Rate (%) = Total profit and tax amount realized during the reporting period / Product sales revenue during the reporting period × 100%

**Note 3**: Industrial Fund Profit and Tax Rate (%) = Total profit and tax amount realized during the reporting period / (Average balance of quota circulating funds during the reporting period + Average balance of net value of fixed assets during the reporting period) × 12 / Cumulative number of months × 100%

**Note 4**: Industrial Comparable Product Cost Reduction Rate (%) = (1 - Actual total cost of comparable products / Total cost of comparable products calculated using the actual average unit cost of the same period last year) × 100%

**Note 5**: Industrial Comprehensive Energy Consumption Reduction Rate (%) = (1 - Energy consumption per 10,000 yuan of industrial total output value during the reporting period / Energy consumption per 10,000 yuan of industrial total output value during the base period) × 100%

　　定期公布的八项重要经济指标解释
    国家统计局制度方法局
    一、固定资产投资额。它是以货币表现的建造和购置固定资产的工作量以及与此有关的费用的总称。固定资产投资的内容有多种，有的要兴工动料组织建筑安装施工，有的要购置设备、工具、器具、仪器及商品房屋，还有的要作必要的准备工作和管理工作，根据报告期实际完成的工程实物量和结算价格计算建筑安装工程价值，加上购置设备、商品房屋等的价值及支出的其他费用，就是固定资产投资额。它是反映固定资产投资规模、速度和投资比例关系的综合性指标，是国家制定投资计划和控制投资规模的重要依据。投资需求是社会总需求的一个主要组成部分，因此，固定资产投资额也是研究社会总供需平衡的重要指标之一。
    现公布的是全民所有制单位基本建设和更新改造自年初至报告月止累计完成的固定资产投资额。
    二、银行贷款余额及增加额。银行贷款余额是指银行向企业事业单位和个人贷放在报告期末尚未收回的贷款额，银行贷款余额的增加额是指银行贷款本期期末余额比期初的增加额。银行贷款余额及增加额是国家观察信贷规模和贷款运行情况的重要经济指标，是国家制定金融政策，进行资金宏观调控的重要依据。
    现公布的是人民银行、工商银行、农业银行、中国银行、交通银行和中信实业银行贷款余额及增加额（交通银行和中信实业银行的数字除深圳外，都不包括在地区数字内）。
    三、职工工资总额。它是各单位在报告期内实际支付给全部职工的劳动报酬总额。包括计时工资、计件工资、基础工资、职务工资、各种奖金、各种津贴、加班工资及其他工资。凡是各单位根据职工劳动的数量和质量支付给职工个人的劳动报酬以及根据国家法令、政策规定支付的其他工资和津贴，不论是由工资科目开支的，还是工资科目以外的其他各项经费科目（如搬运费、材料费、加工费、职工福利基金、企业利润留成与附属机构的业务收入等）开支的，也不论是以货币形式或实物形式支付的，都包括在工资总额内。职工工资总额是消费基金的重要组成部分，这项指标对于研究分配政策、消费品供需平衡和职工生活水平都有重要作用。
    现公布的是全民所有制单位、城镇集体所有制单位及各种合营单位自年初至报告月止累计支付给职工的工资总额。
    四、工业全员劳动生产率。它是指工业企业平均每一职工在单位时间内生产的产品价值量，反映劳动消耗量与劳动成果之间的对比关系，它是企业生产技术水平、经营管理水平、职工技术熟练程度和劳动积极性的综合表现，是考核工业企业劳动效率的重要指标。其计算公式见注一。
    全部职工是指在工业企业工作并由工业企业支付工资的各类人员，包括固定职工、合同制职工和其他职工，但不包括由基建费开支的基建部门的职工。平均人数是指报告期内平均拥有的人数，根据报告期内各月的月平均人数相加除以月数求得；月平均人数是以月内每天实有人数相加之和除以月的日历日数，或用月初与月末人数相加之和除以２求得。
    工业总产值是指工业企业在报告期生产的工业产品总值。包括成品价值、工业性劳务价值和自制半成品、在制品期初期末差额价值。为消除价格变动因素的影响，便于不同时期对比，工业总产值是用可比价格计算的。
    现公布的是全民所有制独立核算工业企业全员劳动生产率。
    五、工业销售利税率。它是指报告期内工业企业已实现的利润和税金总额占同期全部产品销售收入的比率，也就是每百元销售收入实现的利润和税金。利润和税金是从产品销售收入中扣除成本费用之后的盈余，成本越低，盈余就越多，因此工业销售利税率是反映工业企业经营管理水平和经济效益的重要指标之一。其计算公式见注二。
    产品销售收入是指企业对外销售产品、自制半成品和提供工业性劳务等所取得的销售收入。
    实现利润是指企业实现的利润总额，包括实行资金有偿占用办法的企业按规定应从销售收入中交纳的固定资金占用费和流动资金占用费；税金指企业已销售的商品应交纳的产品销售税金，包括企业的产品税、增值税、营业税、城市维护建设税，以及已销售产品应交纳的资源税等。
    现公布的是全民所有制预算内工业企业的销售利税率。
    六、工业资金利税率。它是报告期内工业企业已实现的利润和税金总额与同期全部资金（固定资产净值和定额流动资金）平均余额的比率，也就是每百元资金实现的利润和税金。它是综合反映企业的经营管理水平和资金利用效果的重要指标。为提高资金利税率，不仅要多实现利税，而且要少占用资金，所以考核这项指标有利于推动企业节约资金的占用，加快资金周转。其计算公式见注三。
    定额流动资金是指工业企业财务计划规定最低限度经常需要量的流动资金，包括储备资金、生产资金和成品资金、超储积压物资、待处理流动资产损失。固定资产净值是指固定资产原值减去以往已提取的折旧额后的净值。报告期定额流动资金平均余额和固定资产净值平均余额都是按报告期内各月平均余额之和除以月数计算的。
    报告期实现利润和税金总额在一个年度内计算，就是报告期内各月累计实现的利润和税金总额。为解决报告期长短不一问题，便于不同报告期的数字对比，必须将报告期各月累计实现的利润和税金总额乘以１２／累计月数，化为全年数。
    现公布的是全民所有制预算内工业企业资金利税率。
    七、工业可比产品成本降低率。可比产品是指上年正式生产过、今年继续生产的产品。可比产品成本降低率是指报告期生产的可比产品成本与去年同期对比的升降程度。产品成本是由原材料、燃料、动力及工资等生产费用所组成，可比产品成本降低率一般可以综合反映工业生产过程中物质消耗和劳动消耗节约的经济效益，但是它受物价变动的影响，在原材料等价格上涨幅度较大时，往往表现为可比产品成本上升（上升率以负数表示）。其计算公式见注四。
    式中分子是指企业本期为生产可比产品所支出的成本总额，分母为本期生产的各种可比产品的产量乘以该产品的上年同期实际平均单位成本所计算的总成本。
    现公布的是全民所有制预算内工业企业的可比产品成本降低率。
    八、工业能源消耗综合降低率。它是指报告期平均每万元工业总产值（按可比价格计算）的能源消耗量与去年同期对比的升降百分比。万元工业总产值的能源消耗量说明企业每完成一万元产值所消耗的各种能源数量（折合成标准煤），通过两个时期万元工业总产值的能源消耗量对比，可以综合反映工业企业节约能源消耗的经济效益。其计算公式见注五。
    现公布的是县及县以上全民所有制和集体所有制工业企业的能源综合降低率。
    注一：工业全员劳动生产率（元／人）＝报告期按可比价格计算的工业总产值／报告期工业企业全部职工平均人数
    注二：工业销售利税率（％）＝报告期实现利润和税金总额／报告期产品销售收入×１００％
    注三：工业资金利税率（％）＝报告期实现利润和税金总额／（报告期定额流动资金平均余额＋报告期固定资产净值平均余额）×１２／累计月数×１００％
    注四：工业可比产品成本降低率（％）＝（１－可比产品实际总成本／可比产品按上年同期实际平均单位成本计算的总成本）×１００％
    注五：工业能源消耗综合降低率（％）＝（１－报告期万元工业总产值能源消耗量／基期万元工业总产值能源消耗量）×１００％
