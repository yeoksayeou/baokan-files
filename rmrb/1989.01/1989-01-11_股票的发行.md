The issuance of stocks

In the reform of enterprise shareholding system trials, the first issue that arises when establishing or developing a shareholding company is how to issue stocks and how to determine the issuance price. Let us hear from a colleague at the People's Bank of China on this matter.

The issuance of stocks generally falls into two categories: private placement and public offering. Private placement refers to the shareholding company not going through financial intermediaries but directly selling stocks to a small number of specific investors through private negotiations. Public offering refers to directly or through financial intermediaries issuing stocks to the public. This method involves more procedures. It requires approval from the relevant authorities and the submission of relevant documents. After obtaining approval from the relevant authorities, the printing and issuance of stocks can be arranged. If a financial institution is commissioned to issue stocks to the public, a certain issuance fee must be paid.

The issuance price of stocks is divided into three types: First, face value issuance, which means using the face value of each stock as the issuance price. Second, discount issuance, which means issuing stocks at a discount based on the face value. The size of the discount is negotiated between the company and the sales institution. Generally, if the company's operating performance is good, the discount is smaller; if the company's operating performance is poor, the stock price is bearish, or if it is a newly established company, the discount is larger. Third, premium issuance, which means issuing stocks at a price higher than the face value. Premium issuance is divided into two situations: one is issuing new stocks at a price close to the market price of already issued stocks. The other is taking the average of the face value and market price as the issuance price of new stocks.

In terms of the current situation in China, newly established companies generally issue stocks at face value; for old shareholding companies that already have stocks listed, some use face value issuance, and some use premium issuance.

　　股票的发行
    在企业股份制试点的改革中，组建或发展股份公司，首先面临的问题是如何发行股票以及怎样确定发行价格。下面请中国人民银行的同志来谈一谈。 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　——编者
    股票的发行一般分为私募和公募两种方式。私募，即股份公司不通过金融中介机构，而以私人接洽方式向少数特定投资者直接销售股票。公募，即直接或通过金融中介机构向社会公开发行股票。这种方式手续较复杂。要报经主管部门批准，并提供有关文件；待主管部门批准后，即可联系股票的印制和发行。若委托金融机构向社会发行股票须支付一定的发行费用。
    股票的发行价格分为三种：一、面额发行，即以股票的每股面额作为发行价格。二、折价发行，即依照股票面额打个折扣发行。折扣大小由公司与销售机构具体协商。一般来说，如公司经营效益好，则折扣较小；如公司经营效益不好，股票价格看跌或是新建公司，则折扣较大。三、溢价发行，即按超过股票面额的价格发行。溢价发行又分为两种情况：一种是按照已发股票的市场价或接近市场价的价格发行新股票。另一种是采取票面价格与市场价格的中间值作为新股票的发行价格。
    就我国目前情况而言，新建公司一般都按面额价格发行股票；已有股票上市的老股份公司发行新股票，有些采用面额发行，有些采用溢价发行的办法。
