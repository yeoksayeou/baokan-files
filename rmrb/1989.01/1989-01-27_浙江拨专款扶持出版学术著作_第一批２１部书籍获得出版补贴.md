Zhejiang Allocates Special Funds to Support the Publication of Academic Works
The First Batch of 21 Books Receive Publication Subsidies

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, January 26th — Reporter Gao Haihao reports: The Zhejiang Provincial Publishing House today announced: Starting this year, 1 million yuan will be allocated annually to specifically support the publication of high-quality academic works and books that are difficult to publish due to economic reasons.

While implementing this three-year publication support plan, the Zhejiang Provincial Publishing House has also established a "Tree People Award" to reward outstanding academic works annually.

The responsible person of this publishing house said that currently, various specialized publishing houses have begun to implement the contract responsibility system. As an economic measure, the contract system has established the operating mechanism of publishing houses, which is beneficial for improving economic benefits. However, it has also brought some drawbacks. Some valuable academic works are difficult to publish due to minimal profits or losses. Implementing the publication support plan will help solve these drawbacks.

The Zhejiang Provincial Publishing House has currently identified 21 academic works and valuable art albums as the first batch of publication support priorities.

The Zhejiang Literature and Art Publishing House's publication of "New Era Literary Theory Series," a 9-volume, 4 million-character book, has significant academic value but will incur a loss of nearly 100,000 yuan. Now, this academic work has received a publication loss subsidy, ensuring its smooth publication.

　　浙江拨专款扶持出版学术著作    
    第一批２１部书籍获得出版补贴
    本报杭州１月２６日电  记者高海浩报道：浙江省出版总社今天宣布：今年起，每年集中１００万元资金，专门扶持出版由于经济原因难以问世的高质量学术著作和书籍。
    在实行这项为期３年的出版扶持计划的同时，浙江省出版总社还专门设立一项“树人奖”，每年奖励一批优秀的学术著作。
    这家出版总社的负责人说，目前各专业出版社已开始实行经营承包制。作为一种经济手段，承包确立了出版社的经营机制，有利于提高经济效益，同时也带来了一些弊端，一些颇有价值的学术著作，因为出版微利或亏损而难以问世。实行出版扶持计划有助于解决这些弊端。
    浙江省出版总社目前已确定２１部学术著作和有保存价值的画册，作为第一批出版扶持重点。
    浙江文艺出版社出版的《新时期文学理论大系》，全书９册４００万字，颇有学术价值，但出版将要亏损近１０万元。现在，这一学术著作获得出版亏损补贴，保证了顺利出版。
