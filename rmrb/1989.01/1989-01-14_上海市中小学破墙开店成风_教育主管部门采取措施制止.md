The director of the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau announced yesterday to the principals of primary and secondary schools: The bureau will work with relevant departments to take three measures against the practice of primary and secondary schools "breaking walls to open stores," to stop the spread of this trend.

The three measures are as follows: First, conduct a thorough inspection of primary and secondary schools that have "broken walls to open stores." The general principle is that it should not affect normal teaching order, the safety of teachers and students, the appearance of the school, the overall school planning, and the solution to the problem of the peak enrollment period. Those that meet this principle can be retained, otherwise, they must be corrected within a specified time. Second, in a few commercial areas, according to the district government's planning, utilizing the schools along the street to "break walls to open stores" to increase commercial outlets, those that meet the first principle and have specific and complete compensation measures and methods, must also be strictly controlled, and need to be reviewed, approved, and filed by the relevant departments. Third, the school buildings and grounds of primary and secondary schools are state-owned properties managed by the educational administration. All income from schools "breaking walls to open stores" and renting out school buildings and grounds should be managed by the educational administration, arranged and used in a unified manner, and cannot be retained by the schools.

In a previous period, a trend of "breaking walls to open stores" and renting out school grounds and buildings emerged in primary and secondary schools in Shanghai, which sparked widespread discussion. The Municipal Education Bureau believes that these phenomena are products of a certain social background. Under the conditions of insufficient educational funds, large gaps in teachers' bonuses, and urgent need to solve educational conditions, some schools "breaking walls to open stores" can temporarily alleviate some contradictions. However, fundamentally speaking, it is not beneficial to the development of the educational cause.

　　上海市中小学破墙开店成风
    教育主管部门采取措施制止
    本报上海１月１３日电  上海市教育局局长昨天向中小学校长们宣布：该局将会同有关方面，对中小学“破墙开店”的做法采取三条措施，制止这股风的蔓延。
    这三条措施是：一、对已“破墙开店”的中小学作一次认真全面的检查，总的原则是不影响正常教学秩序、师生安全、校容校貌、学校总体规划和解决入学高峰问题。符合此原则的可保留，否则限期纠正。二、少数商业地区根据区政府规划，利用沿街学校“破墙开店”，增设商业网点，符合第一条原则、并有确实完善的补偿措施及办法的，也要从严掌握，需经有关部门审核、批准、备案。三、中小学校舍、场地是教育行政部门管理的国有财产，凡学校“破墙开店”和出租校舍、场地所得的收入，应由教育行政部门加强管理，统筹安排使用，不能由学校留用。
    前一时期，上海市中小学出现了一股“破墙开店”、出租场地校舍之风，引起了广泛的议论。市教育局认为，这些现象是在一定的社会背景下产生的。在教育经费不足、教师奖金缺口很大、办学条件急待解决的情况下，一些学校“破墙开店”能暂时缓解一些矛盾。但是，从根本上来说，对发展教育事业是不利的。
