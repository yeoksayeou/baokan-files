North Korean Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Says
Japan Lacks Conditions for Improving Relations

	Pyeongyang, January 12 (Xinhua) - North Korean Foreign Ministry Spokesperson said on January 11 that Japan's desire to improve relations with North Korea is a good thing, and North Korea also hopes to develop relations with neighboring Japan according to the wishes and interests of the two peoples. However, the current conditions and environment for improving Japan-North Korea relations are not in place.

	The spokesperson said that recently, the Japanese government has repeatedly expressed its desire to improve Japan-North Korea relations and has even proposed government-level contact and dialogue. North Korea has consistently advocated for improving and developing Japan-North Korea relations on the basis of mutual equality and respect for sovereignty. However, the Japanese government has pursued a policy of leaning towards South Korea, continued to be hostile towards North Korea, and attempted to use the methods of "cross-recognition" and "cross-contact" to create "two Koreas." The spokesperson listed a series of past and present issues in Japan-North Korea relations and said that North Korea is unclear about Japan's "true intentions" in wanting to improve relations with North Korea.

	The spokesperson pointed out that under the current abnormal state, North Korea cannot engage in government-level contact with Japan, and even if it did, it would not be able to solve any problems. If the Japanese government truly wants to improve Japan-North Korea relations, it should first remove the obstacles to improving relations.

### 朝鲜外交部发言人说  朝日不具备改善关系条件

　　朝鲜外交部发言人说
    朝日不具备改善关系条件
    本报平壤１月１２日电  记者徐宝康报道：朝鲜外交部发言人１１日发表谈话说，日本政府希望同朝鲜改善关系是件好事情，朝鲜也希望同近邻日本按照两国人民的愿望和利益发展关系，但目前并不具备改善朝日关系的实质性条件和环境。
    发言人说，最近日本政府多次表示希望改善日朝关系，不久前还提出进行政府级接触和对话的建议。朝鲜一贯坚持在相互平等和尊重自主权的原则下，改善和发展朝日关系，但日本政府却推行向南朝鲜一边倒的政策，继续敌视朝鲜，并企图以“交叉承认”和“交叉接触”的方法，制造“两个朝鲜”。发言人列举了朝日关系上一系列过去和现在存在的问题后说，朝鲜不清楚日本希望同朝鲜改善关系的“真正意图”。
    这位发言人指出，在目前非正常状态下，朝鲜不能同日本进行政府级的接触，即使接触了也不可能解决任何问题。日本政府如果真心希望改善日朝关系，就应当首先排除改善关系的障碍。
