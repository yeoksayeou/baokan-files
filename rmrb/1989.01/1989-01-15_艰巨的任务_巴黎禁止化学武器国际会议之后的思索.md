The Arduous Task: Reflections After the Paris International Conference on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons
By Zhang Qixun, Our Correspondent

Following the Paris International Conference on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the American media continues to pay close attention to the issue of chemical weapons. An article in The New York Times on January 12 noted that the decisions made at the Paris conference have made governments more aware of the problem of chemical weapons and their proliferation. However, there are many obstacles on the road to a new treaty. Both the United States and the Soviet Union possess large quantities of chemical weapons, and reaching an agreement to prohibit the production and destruction of chemical weapons will be a very arduous task.

The prohibition of chemical weapons has always been an important disarmament issue that the international community has focused on. For many years, the Geneva Disarmament Conference, with 40 participating countries, has been negotiating to conclude a comprehensive convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons. From the progress of the negotiations, significant progress has been made, but there are still many unresolved issues, many of which are related to the attitudes of the Soviet Union and the United States.

Before and after the Paris International Conference, the attitudes of the Soviet Union and the United States have undergone some changes. On January 8, the Soviet Foreign Minister announced that the Soviet Union would begin destroying its stockpiled chemical weapons this year and stated that in the past two years, the Soviet Union had stopped producing chemical weapons and called on all countries to stop production. The Soviet Union also agreed to allow inspections at any time and in any place. Recently, the Director of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency also published an article in a newspaper outlining the U.S. position, proposing that the best way to prohibit the use and prevent the proliferation of chemical weapons is to sign a "truly global and effectively verifiable comprehensive convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons." However, considering that there is still a lot of work to be done in the negotiations, the article advocates restoring the integrity of the 1925 Geneva Protocol in the current situation, strengthening the authority of the United Nations Secretary-General in investigating the use of chemical weapons. At the same time, the United States also proposed that in the future, sanctions should be imposed on countries that violate the agreement, and the international community should take joint action to stop the proliferation of chemical weapons.

From the statements of the United States and the Soviet Union, their positions have become closer in some aspects, but they are not entirely the same. For example, on the issue of destroying and stopping the production of chemical weapons, the United States welcomes the Soviet Union's latest announcement but has made some reservations. U.S. officials believe that the United States is also destroying outdated chemical weapons, and the Soviet Union has a large chemical arsenal, much of which is outdated. The Soviet Union has not publicly stated what it is destroying or how much it is destroying, so the military value of this announcement is not yet clear. Secondly, the United States believes that the Soviet Union has long produced chemical weapons, making its chemical arsenal modern, and the United States resumed production in late 1987 to modernize its chemical weapons. Therefore, it is not yet possible to abandon production. On the issue of inspections, the United States and the Soviet Union both agree in principle to on-site inspections, but turning this into an implementation plan is not something that can be done overnight. The United States believes that the complexity of how to inspect the destruction and how to inspect the guarantee of not producing chemical weapons is even greater than that of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. It seems that the negotiations on chemical weapons are not easy and will take some time.

As for how to deal with the issue of chemical weapons before the signing of a comprehensive convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons, this international conference has played its role. The international community has unanimously expressed its desire to fulfill the obligation to prohibit the use of chemical weapons as signed in 1925, promoting multilateral negotiations in Geneva. From the American perspective, the official is satisfied with the declaration of the conference but also feels it is not entirely satisfactory, especially in the areas where the United States advocates strengthening the control of technology and equipment exports and imposing sanctions on countries that use chemical weapons. Washington wanted the conference to "use stronger language." It seems that the United States will continue to insist on its position in these areas in the future.

People believe that although the Paris International Conference has achieved results, the existing international conventions related to the prohibition of chemical weapons are very incomplete and have many limitations. The Soviet Union and the United States are the countries with the largest chemical arsenals. Therefore, if they do not take the lead in prohibiting chemical weapons, difficulties will continue to arise in the future.

### 艰巨的任务——巴黎禁止化学武器国际会议之后的思索

　　艰巨的任务
    ——巴黎禁止化学武器国际会议之后的思索
    本报记者  张启昕
    在巴黎举行的禁止化学武器国际大会之后，美国舆论界对于化学武器的关注仍然不减。《纽约时报》１月１２日的一篇评论认为，巴黎大会的决定使各国政府更加关注化学武器及其扩散的问题，但在走向一项新的条约的道路上障碍不少，美苏都拥有大量化学武器，要达成禁止生产和销毁化学武器的协议，将是一件十分艰巨的任务。
    禁止化学武器，本是国际社会一贯重视的重要裁军议题。多年来，有４０国参加的日内瓦裁军会议一直在为缔结一项全面禁止化学武器条约而进行谈判。从谈判进程看，已经取得了明显进展，但确实还存在不少问题尚未解决，其中在很大程度上又与苏美两国的态度有关。
    在巴黎国际大会前后，苏美两国的态度都发生了一些变化。苏联外长１月８日宣布，苏联将从今年开始销毁其贮存的化学武器，并称近两年来，苏联已经停止生产化学武器，要求各国都不生产。苏联还同意在任何时候对任何地点进行广泛的核查。美国军备控制和裁军署署长不久前也在报上发表文章阐述美国立场，提出禁止使用和杜绝扩散化学武器的最好办法是签订一项“真正全球性的并能有效核查的全面禁止化学武器条约”，但鉴于谈判还有大量工作要做，因而主张在当前情况下，恢复１９２５年日内瓦议定书的完整性，加强联合国秘书长在调查使用化学武器方面的权力。同时美国还提出今后要对违约国实行制裁，要求国际社会采取共同行动制止化学武器扩散。
    从美苏的言论看，它们的立场在一些方面已经接近，但也不尽相同。
    例如在销毁和停止生产化学武器上，美国欢迎苏联的最新宣布，但提出了一些保留。美国官员认为，对于过时的化学武器，美国也在销毁，苏联拥有庞大化学武库，其中一大部分是过时的，苏联并未公开说明销毁什么、销毁多少，因此这一宣布的军事价值尚不清楚。其次，美国认为，苏联长期生产化学武器，已使化学武库现代化，美国在１９８７年底恢复生产，也要使化学武器现代化，因此目前还不能放弃生产。在核查问题上，苏美原则上都同意现场核查，但要把这一点变为实施细则，并非一朝一夕之功。美国认为，在如何核查销毁以及如何核查保证不再生产化学武器的问题上，其复杂的程度甚至超过中导条约。如此看来，化学武器问题的谈判并不轻松，还要费些时间。
    至于在一项全面禁止化学武器条约签订之前，如何对待这类武器问题，这次巴黎国际大会起到了它的作用，国际社会一致表达了履行１９２５年签订的禁止使用化学武器义务的愿望，推动了日内瓦的多边谈判。从美国来看，官方对会议的宣言表示满意，但也感到不尽满足，特别是在美国主张加强技术和设备出口控制以及对使用化学武器国家实行制裁方面。华盛顿本想让会议“使用更为强硬的措词”。看来，美国在这些方面，今后还会坚持自己的主张。
    人们认为，巴黎国际大会虽然取得了成果，但现有的有关禁止化学武器的国际条约是很不完整的，局限性很大，而美苏两国又是拥有最大化学武库的国家，因此，如果它们不在禁止化学武器上率先行动，那么今后仍会出现困难局面。
