    China adopts protective policies for foreign investment projects and offers special treatment to Taiwanese investors, said Liu Xiangdong, spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, on January 23. He emphasized that while China is reducing the scale of basic construction, it is implementing protective measures for foreign-invested projects and strictly adhering to signed contracts. Taiwanese investors are eligible for various special privileges.

    Liu Xiangdong reported that since September last year, when China began reducing construction projects, it has planned to attract a batch of urgently needed projects for national economic construction. China has also adhered to the principle of "honoring contracts and keeping promises," creating conditions to ensure the smooth implementation of signed contracts. Statistics show that the number of foreign-invested projects signed, implemented, and the amount of funds invested in the second half of last year all increased significantly compared to the first half.

    In response to questions about Taiwanese investment in the mainland, Liu Xiangdong said that the Taiwanese authorities have so far refused to accept the "three links" proposal, but Taiwanese people have been circumventing the authorities' obstacles to invest in the mainland. According to incomplete statistics from 26 provinces and cities, from January to November last year, approximately 435 projects were approved for direct investment by Taiwanese individuals, with an investment amount of $520 million.

    Liu Xiangdong stated that Taiwanese investors enjoy various special treatments compared to other foreign investors. For example, the investment scope is broader, allowing them to choose investment projects beyond those publicly announced by China; investment methods are flexible, in addition to establishing "three types of enterprises," they can also purchase mainland stocks, bonds, and real estate; Taiwanese investors can serve as chairpersons or equivalent positions in joint ventures and cooperative projects; approval procedures are more streamlined, with no restrictions on the investment and operation period; and they enjoy more favorable treatment in areas such as raw materials and product markets compared to mainland state-owned enterprises. Liu Xiangdong added that according to China's constitutional provisions, the investments and other assets of Taiwanese investors will not be nationalized.

　　我对外资项目采取保护政策  台湾投资者可享受特殊待遇
    本报北京１月２３日讯  记者陆振华报道：经贸部新闻发言人刘向东今天说，中国在压缩基本建设规模中，对外商投资项目采取保护政策，对已签合同的项目认真履行合同。台湾投资者可享受多种特殊待遇。去年９月我国压缩建设项目以来，我在吸收外资中不仅有计划地吸收了一批国民经济建设所急需的项目，还坚持“重合同，守信用”的原则，创造条件使已签订的合同顺利执行。据统计，去年下半年外商投资项目签约数、实施项目和投入资金比上半年均有较多增加。
    刘向东回答记者有关台湾到大陆投资的问题时说，台湾当局至今仍拒绝“三通”建议，但台胞不断绕过当局阻碍前来大陆投资。据２６个省市不完全统计，去年１—１１月已批准直接以台胞身份投资的项目约４３５个，投资金额５．２亿美元。
    刘向东说，台湾投资者同外商相比享受多种特殊待遇。如投资领域较宽，可在我公布的项目外选择其他投资项目；投资方式灵活，除可举办“三资企业”外，还可以买大陆的股票、债券和房产等；台胞投资者可以担任合资、合作项目的董事长或相当的职务；审批的手续更加便捷，投资经营期限不受限制；在原材料、产品市场等方面享受比大陆国营企业更优惠的待遇。刘向东说，根据我国的宪法规定，对台湾投资者的投资和其他资产不会实行国有化。
