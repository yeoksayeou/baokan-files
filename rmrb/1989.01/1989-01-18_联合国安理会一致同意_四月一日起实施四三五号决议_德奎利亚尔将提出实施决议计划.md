The United Nations Security Council today unanimously adopted a resolution deciding to begin implementing Security Council Resolution 435, passed in 1978, on achieving Namibia's independence starting April 1 this year.

The resolution adopted today urges the South African authorities to immediately and significantly reduce the more than 8,000 police forces deployed in Namibia, so as to maintain a relative balance with the United Nations peacekeeping forces that will be deployed in the region.

The resolution requires the United Nations Secretary-General to promptly submit a detailed and specific plan on how to execute Resolution 435, to re-examine the necessary conditions for the United Nations to send peacekeeping forces to Namibia, and to save as much expenditure as possible while ensuring the completion of the mission of these forces.

According to Resolution 435, the United Nations peacekeeping forces to be sent to Namibia will consist of 9,000 military and civilian personnel, with an annual budget of $650 million. Over the past month or so, Cuba has decided to withdraw its troops from Angola, and South Africa has also agreed to implement Resolution 435. The situation in southwestern Africa has thus tended to ease. Therefore, the five permanent members of the Security Council have demanded a reduction in the number of United Nations peacekeeping forces to be stationed in Namibia. However, the non-aligned countries in the Security Council believe that the South African authorities have always been untrustworthy, and thus disagree with reducing the size of this United Nations force.

Today's resolution authorizes United Nations Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar to resolve this issue. According to United Nations officials, the Secretary-General will submit a detailed plan on the implementation of Resolution 435 to the Security Council within the next week.

　　联合国安理会一致同意
    四月一日起实施四三五号决议
    德奎利亚尔将提出实施决议计划
    新华社联合国１月１６日电  （记者雷力利）联合国安理会今天一致通过一项决议，决定从今年４月１日开始实施安理会于１９７８年通过的关于实现纳米比亚独立的４３５号决议。
    今天通过的决议敦促南非当局立即大幅度削减部署在纳米比亚的８０００多名警察部队，以便同将要在这一地区部署的联合国维持和平部队保持相对的平衡。
    决议要求联合国秘书长就如何执行４３５号决议尽快提出一项详细具体的计划，重新审查联合国向纳米比亚派遣维持和平部队的必要条件，以便在确保这一部队完成其使命的情况下尽可能节省开支。
    根据４３５号决议，联合国派往纳米比亚的维持和平部队将由９０００名军职和文职人员组成，其一年的预算开支为６．５亿美元。在过去的一个多月中，古巴已决定从安哥拉撤军，南非亦同意执行４３５号决议，西南部非洲的局势已趋向缓和，因此，安理会中的五个常任理事国要求削减联合国派驻纳米比亚维持和平部队的数量。然而，安理会中的不结盟国家则认为南非当局一向不守信用，因此不同意削减这支联合国部队的规模。
    今天通过的决议授权联合国秘书长佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔来解决这一问题。据联合国官员说，秘书长将在今后一周内向安理会提交一项有关执行４３５号决议的详细计划。
