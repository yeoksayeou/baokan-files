The evaluation of the 1988 National Commercial Sheep Farm Construction, organized by the Ministry of Agriculture, was recently announced in Lanzhou. Among the 63 units from 11 provinces and autonomous regions that participated in the intense competition, 4 banners and counties from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region were rated as advanced, and 2 banners and counties received commendations.

Since 1985, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has established 16 commercial sheep farms. Currently, these farms have a total of over 8 million sheep. The supporting infrastructure and investments total 676 million yuan. Just for this year's livestock production, the 16 farms produced 14,820.3 tons of wool from fine-wool sheep and 392.5 tons of cashmere, generating an additional economic benefit of over 158 million yuan, which is 2.2 times the investment.
