A Hard-Won Harvest – Dedicated to the Beijing Oil Painting Human Figure Art Exhibition
Cheng Ma

I
Millions of Chinese people finally broke free from a long and bitter spiritual purgatory and confidently entered the sacred hall of human figure art.

The descendants of the Yellow Emperor no longer feel dazzled, frightened, or perverted by the richest beauty of human bones, muscles, postures, and spirits. The Chinese Venus finally wiped away layers of dullness and hypocrisy, bathed in the morning light of modern culture, and walked gracefully on the yellow earth.

The ancestors of the Chinese people had once struggled with strength and physique, reflecting a dynamic figure of dragons and tigers;

The owners of the Mogao Caves once rode the auspicious clouds of Sino-foreign cultural exchange, leaving fluid and elegant dance postures;

The early awakening of Eastern modern aesthetics also disregarded the rumors of pseudo-scholarship and even feudal axes, and devotedly depicted the harmony and health of spirit and flesh on a white canvas...

However, in the art gallery of humanity, the true bodies of the descendants of the Yellow Emperor are rarely seen, and the world's treasury of beauty lacks the vital rhythm of the Chinese people. Venus, David, the Thinker... countless examples of human beauty are proudly displayed, but the Chinese people have long been unaware of their own dignity, strength, or the beauty of their bodies, even if they are slandered as stiff, bloated, and sloppy, they are not ashamed.

The rules that suppress and harm life and flesh are the abscesses and garbage of culture. Once the awakened and healthy soul faces the body through the dense fog, whether it sees strength, fullness, or fatigue and weakness, it is an aesthetic observation and an artistic sublimation. – China should have its own human figure art, its own Venus.

II
The spiritual shackles have been too strict and too long, and the liberation of the soul after breaking free from the net has brought a highly concentrated historical focus and a dazzling array of views:

Lifelike human figures wander here, and real life breathes here; the strength of men and the charm of women are all before our eyes;

The light and thin mist that lingers here, the duet of spirit and flesh, the rhythmic disco of strength, the imagination and dreams give the skin a mysterious modern splendor;

There are also those bodies that inspire endless thoughts and are worth pondering, those sudden whims of posture images, which bring about great enlightenment and also lead to inexplicable bewilderment.

Is this the surging of life force, or is it a chaotic artistic outpouring? Perhaps, the realm of flesh is as boundless as the universe of spirit. This is the grand chorus of the Chinese people from ancient times to the present. Dignified, unrestrained, bizarre, and ethereal, it is these contrasting yet complementary complex strokes that depict the colorful essence of the current transformation and renewal of Chinese life.

III
This is the fearless and selfless nakedness. It sweeps away a whirlwind of cleansing lust and diseased desires, placing the scale of beauty on everyone's heart.

We, the descendants of the civilized and polite country, have once eagerly enjoyed those elaborate decorations, too indulged in external meticulous adornment, and even distorted beauty into sensuality, and greed into aesthetics. Decoration overwhelmed simplicity, and culture corrupted instincts. But now, all affectation makes one nauseous, and any adornment seems redundant. Here, it requires your sincerity, it examines your heart, to see if you are pure and innocent, or base and vulgar.

The soul of the Chinese nation stands at a new aesthetic peak, ready to embark on a new cultural long march. The budding youth is full of hope, the sturdy and mature bones can bear the heavy history, and even the exhausted and depleted are like the twilight with endless afterglow. When people unanimously fill and infuse these countless carriers of beauty with a sacred and elegant spirit, they will also gain their own innocence and beauty.

Just as the yellow earth exposes its vastness and barrenness to the world, the descendants of Nüwa begin to compete with the descendants of Eve with their own bodies, allowing others to evaluate. No need for shyness, no need for vanity, daring to reveal their true selves to the world without any hesitation, is the starting point of self-respect and self-awareness.

IV
The birth of China's Venus was so difficult, and one can imagine the labor of China's Rodins and the eventual weary smile.

The mother of beauty is even more unfortunate than her beloved children. Loving parents worry about their children stepping onto the model's workbench, always fearing that beauty will sacrifice their own flesh and blood; scholars pour filthy language into the sacred and pure art garden, transferring the infamous names of seduction and theft to them; and there are those ruffians with vulgar eyes, mocking the beautiful shapes in every way. Facing such inexplicable worldly nets, artists present a pure heart and a full heart of dedication. For art, for people, they are willing to bear the heavy cross. Every sacred statue is also a self-portrait of the artist. The twisted winds and clouds have reduced the harvest that should have been, but this can be called a genuine "exhibition":

People see from this hard-won harvest the great "human" of China's Rodins.

　　艰难的收获
    ——致北京油画人体艺术大展
    程麻
    一
    千万中国人最终挣脱漫长而苦涩的精神炼狱，理直气壮地迈进人体艺术的圣洁殿堂。
    黄帝子孙们对人类最富有的骨骼、肌肉、姿态和神韵之美，不再眩惑，不再心惊肉跳，也不再变态；中国的维纳斯们终于拂拭掉层层沉闷与虚伪的遮掩，沐浴着现代文化的晨曦，赤诚地、步履优雅地在黄土地上姗姗走来。
    华夏先民本有过膂力和体魄的拚搏，映现出一副龙腾虎跃的身影；
    莫高窟的主人们也曾乘着中外文化交汇的祥云，留下流畅、飘逸的柔美舞姿；
    东方近代美感的先觉者更无视伪道学的流言，乃至封建的斧钺，在洁白的画布上潜心描绘灵与肉的和谐健美……
    可是，人类艺术画廊里竟罕见炎黄后代的肉体真身，世界美的库藏里绝少华夏血脉的生命律动。维纳斯、大卫、思想者……无数人体美的典范，尽情地炫耀，唯独中国人迟迟觉察不到自身的庄重矫健、丰腴或刚劲之美，即使被人诬为呆板、臃肿和邋遢，也毫不自惭。
    压抑、戕害生命血肉的清规戒律是文化的痈疽和垃圾。觉醒与健全的心灵一旦透过浓密的雾障直面肉体，不管看到的是强健、充实，还是疲惫、羸弱，都是审美的观照、艺术的升华。——中国应有自己的人体艺术，自己的维纳斯。
    　　　　二
    精神的禁锢太严、太久了，冲决罗网后的心灵解放换来的竟是高度浓缩的历史聚焦和目迷五色的洋洋大观：
    栩栩如生的人体在这里倘佯，逼真的生命在这里呼吸，男人的强悍和女人的柔媚尽现眼前；
    时时缭绕着轻轻薄雾笼罩下的灵与肉的二重奏，响起那节奏铿锵的力的迪斯科，畅想与梦幻赋予肌肤以神秘的现代绚丽；
    还有那令人浮想联翩、耐人寻味的躯体变奏，那些忽发奇想的体态意象，换来了种种大彻大悟，也引出了百思不得其解的茫然。
    这是生命力的喷涌而出，还是杂乱无章的艺术宣泄？也许，肉的天地本就是与灵的宇宙一样风光无限。这是古今华夏生灵的大合唱。端庄、奔放、怪诞、缥缈，正是这些反差强烈而又协调互补的繁复笔触，描绘出当今中国人生蜕变更新的斑斓本象。
    　　　　三
    这里是无私无畏的赤裸坦裎。它刮起一阵荡涤淫邪与病态情欲的旋风，把审美的天平架在了每个人的心上。
    我们这些文明礼仪之邦的后裔，曾热心玩味那些繁文缛节的装点，太沉湎于外在的精心修饰，甚至把美歪曲为香艳，将贪婪冒充成审美。虚饰压倒了朴素，文化毒害了本能。而如今，一切扭捏作态都令人作呕，任何装扮都显得多余，这里要你的真诚，看你的内心，审视你是纯净无邪，还是卑劣庸俗。
    中华民族的心灵站在新的审美制高点上，即将开始新的文化长征。含苞待放的青春洋溢着希望，刚健圆熟的骨骼撑得起沉重的历史，连奉献殆尽的枯竭也像黄昏一样余韵无穷。当人们不约而同地以圣洁高雅的精神充实、灌注这无数美的载体，也将赢得自身的无邪与美好。
    如同黄土地把广袤连同贫瘠一起袒露在这个星球上，女娲的子孙开始以自己的体魄与夏娃的后代从容媲美，任人品评。无需羞涩，无需虚荣，敢于在世人面前毫无顾忌地展现其面目，便是自尊的起点、自我的觉醒。
    　　　　四
    中国的维纳斯诞生得多么艰难，可以想见中国的罗丹们孕育的劳累，以及那最终浮现出的憔悴的微笑。
    美的母亲比他们的宁馨儿更加命运蹇乖。慈爱的父母忧虑地看着儿女走上模特儿的工作台，时时担心为美牺牲了亲骨肉；道学家则把污言秽语倾进神圣纯洁的艺术园地，向他们转嫁诲淫诲盗的恶名；还有那些嘻皮笑脸的无赖，以粗俗的目光盯住优美的造型，百般嘲弄。面对着如此莫名其妙的世俗罗网，艺术家们捧出的是一颗高洁的心灵和那满腔的献身精神。为艺术，为人而宁愿背上沉重的十字架。座座圣洁的雕像，也是艺术家的自身写照。阴错阳差的风云，曾经消减了本该有的更多收获，然而这称得上是名副其实的“大展”：
    人们从这艰难的收获中看到了中国的罗丹们的大写的“人”。
