Chinese short-track speed skaters achieved great success yesterday by breaking two world records in the men's and women's 1500-meter events during the national short-track speed skating championship held this evening.

The Minister of the State Sports Commission, Wǔ Shàozǔ, attended the competition. In the women's 1500-meter final, Winter Olympic Games exhibition champion Lǐ Yán and two rising stars, Wáng Xiùlán and Guō Hóngrú, took the lead. Following the coach's pre-race strategy, they took turns leading and maintained a high overall speed. Wáng Xiùlán from Qiqihar and Guō Hóngrú from Changchun, both 18 years old, nearly crossed the finish line at the same time, with times of 2 minutes 31.9 seconds and 2 minutes 32 seconds, respectively. Their performances, along with those of Lǐ Yán, surpassed the world record of 2 minutes 34.85 seconds set by Lǐ Yán at last year's Winter Olympics. Today, Zhāng Yánméi and Lǐ Jīnyàn also surpassed this record.

In the men's 1500-meter final, skaters from Changchun, Jiāng Zhìbīn, Bái Chéng's Jǔ Xuěsōng, and Qiqihar's Xú Yīngnán worked together. All three skaters surpassed the world record of 2 minutes 25.25 seconds set by Canadian skater Michel last year. Jiāng Zhìbīn had the best performance with a time of 2 minutes 23.8 seconds.

After the competition, Chinese women's team coach Xīn Qíngshān told reporters, "The fact that both men and women skaters broke world records proves that our athletes have the strength to compete in major international events. However, short-track speed skating is not just about physical ability; our athletes need to improve their tactical awareness and competitive skills to achieve good results in international competitions."

　　短跑道速滑健儿报捷  昨日超两项世界纪录
    本报北京１月１０日讯  记者李北大报道：我国短跑速滑运动员在今晚举行的全国短跑道速滑冠军赛男女１５００米比赛中，有５名女选手和３名男选手超过两项世界纪录。
    国家体委主任伍绍祖到赛场观看了比赛。女子１５００米决赛，冬奥会表演赛冠军李琰和两名后起之秀王秀兰、郭红茹率先出发。她们按照教练赛前部署，相互领滑，保证了整体滑行速度。来自齐齐哈尔的王秀兰和长春的郭红茹这两名年仅１８岁的新秀几乎同时冲过终点，成绩分别为２分３１秒９和２分３２秒。她俩和李琰的成绩均超过李琰在去年冬奥会上创造的２分３４秒８５的该项目世界纪录。今天，张艳梅和李金艳也超过这一成绩。
    在男子１５００米决赛中，长春选手蒋志斌、白城选手朱雪松和齐齐哈尔选手徐英楠齐心协力，三人成绩都超过了加拿大选手米歇尔在去年创造的２分２５秒２５的世界纪录。蒋志斌成绩最好，为２分２３秒８。
    比赛结束后，中国女队教练辛庆山对记者说，男女选手双双超过世界纪录，证明了我们的选手具有在世界大赛上称雄的实力。但短跑道速滑比赛不光是队员身体机能的较量，我们的选手要想在国际赛场取得好名次，还需要在战术意识、对抗能力等上面下功夫。
