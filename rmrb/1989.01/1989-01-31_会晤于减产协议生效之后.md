Title: Meeting After the Production Cut Agreement Comes Into Effect

As of the New Year, the OPEC production cut agreement has come into effect. The long-term sluggish oil market has shown signs of hope, with oil prices continuing to rebound. On January 18, the price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures on the New York market reached $19.26 per barrel, a sharp increase from about $10 per barrel just over a month ago. This rapid and significant rebound is unprecedented in over a year. Against this backdrop, oil experts from OPEC and non-OPEC countries held a joint meeting in London on January 27 to discuss the stabilization of the global oil market. The timing of this meeting, just as the oil prices have surged, may hold special significance.

However, the recommendations put forward to various governments at the London meeting have not been disclosed. The market sentiment suggests that the meeting did not yield specific results, leading to a slight drop in oil prices on the New York market. This fact indicates that the current oil price situation remains fragile and needs to be jointly maintained. It is precisely for this reason that OPEC and non-OPEC oil-producing countries have come together to engage in mutual consultations.

From the perspective of non-OPEC oil-producing countries, there seems to be skepticism about whether OPEC can adhere to the production cut agreement. This is because OPEC's past production limits have had little binding force on its member countries. Many member countries often prioritize their national interests and use various excuses and methods to exceed production quotas or engage in disguised overproduction. Non-OPEC oil-producing countries hope to obtain a long-term commitment from OPEC to seriously implement the production cut agreement.

From the perspective of OPEC member countries, they are concerned about whether non-OPEC oil-producing countries will cooperate. To maintain oil prices, they have reduced their production from 31 million barrels per day in 1979 to the current 18.5 million barrels per day. The oil production capacity has been in a state of severe underutilization for a long time. When OPEC is limiting production to maintain prices, they certainly do not want to see other oil-producing countries quietly increasing their production and encroaching on their market share. If this happens, it will inevitably undermine OPEC's implementation of the production cut agreement and exacerbate market volatility.

Before the production cut agreement was signed at the end of last year, Saudi Arabia, an important OPEC member, proposed setting the oil price at $15 to $18 per barrel. Although this proposal was not adopted, it reflected Saudi Arabia's intention to control the oil price at $15 per barrel. On January 10, Aramco published the latest estimate of Saudi Arabia's proven oil reserves at 252.38 billion barrels, an increase of 51% from the 167.4 billion barrels estimated a year ago, accounting for more than 1/4 of the world's known total reserves. Saudi Arabia's resource advantage allows it the possibility of using an "oil price war" to seize a larger market share.

To dispel mutual doubts and concerns, OPEC and non-OPEC oil-producing countries held this meeting shortly after the production cut agreement came into effect. The purpose is obviously not only to stabilize the current oil prices but also to have a long-term vision.

In fact, the fluctuations in oil prices have made OPEC and non-OPEC oil-producing countries further realize that stabilizing oil prices is "a collective responsibility." The unpredictable situation of international oil prices does not allow any party to increase oil production. To achieve this goal, OPEC and some non-OPEC oil-producing countries have also exerted influence on important oil-producing countries such as the Soviet Union and Britain through various channels. This time, observers from the Soviet Union, Norway, and the United States attended the London meeting, indicating that coordination in this regard has made some progress.

Looking at the development trend, the dialogue between OPEC and non-OPEC oil-producing countries will continue. Because, in the future, to maintain oil prices at a reasonable level for a long time, in addition to OPEC's serious implementation of the production cut agreement, the active cooperation of non-OPEC oil-producing countries is becoming increasingly important. Without this, any party's efforts may ultimately be in vain.

　　会晤于减产协议生效之后
    顾玉清
    从元旦起，欧佩克减产协议开始生效，长期疲软的石油市场出现了希望之光，油价持续反弹后，１月１８日纽约市场西得克萨斯中质原油期货价格每桶达１９．２６美元，这和一个多月前的每桶１０美元左右相比，回升之快，升幅之大，是一年多来从未有过的。在此背景下，来自欧佩克和非欧佩克的石油专家们２７日在伦敦举行联席会议，讨论稳定世界石油市场问题。双方此时此刻举行会晤，也许比油价大幅度下跌时更具特殊意义。
    然而，伦敦会晤，向各国政府提出的建议未见透露，市场心理以为会议没有具体成果，纽约市场油价出现小幅回落。这个事实表明，目前油价形势仍较脆弱，需要共同来维护。欧佩克和非欧佩克产油国也正是基于这一点而走到一起，进行相互磋商的。
    从非欧佩克产油国来说，对欧佩克能否坚持减产协议似有疑虑。因为，欧佩克历次限产协议对各成员国约束力不大，不少成员国往往从本国利益出发，以各种借口和以不同手段超产和变相超产。非欧佩克产油国希望得到欧佩克长期认真执行减产协议的承诺。
    从欧佩克成员国来说，他们对非欧佩克产油国能否给予合作表示担心。为维护石油价格，他们已将产量从１９７９年日产３１００万桶减少到现在的日产１８５０万桶，石油生产能力长期处于严重开工不足状态。欧佩克在限产保价的时候，绝不愿意看到另一些产油国悄悄地提高产量，抢占他们的部分市场。倘若如此，势必破坏欧佩克执行减产保价协议，加剧石油市场动荡。
    在去年底签订减产协议前，欧佩克重要成员国沙特阿拉伯就提出将油价定为每桶１５至１８美元的建议。尽管这一建议未被采纳，但这反映了沙特想把油价控制在１５美元一桶的意向。１月１０日阿美石油公司公布沙特可采原油储量的最新估计数字为２５２３．８亿桶，比一年前的１６７４亿桶提高了５１％，在世界已知总储量中沙特约占１／４以上。沙特阿拉伯的资源优势，使它有可能通过“油价战”去夺取更多的市场份额。
    为了消除各自的疑虑和担心，在减产协议生效后不久，欧佩克和非欧佩克产油国举行此次会晤，其目的显然不仅在于稳定目前油价，且有着眼于长远之意。
    事实上，油价升沉起落的后果，已使欧佩克和非欧佩克产油国进一步认识到，稳定油价是“一项集体的责任”，国际油价捉摸不定的形势，不允许任何一方增加石油产量。为达此目的，欧佩克和一些非欧佩克产油国还通过多种途径，对苏联和英国等重要产油国施加影响。这次苏联、挪威和美国等能派观察员出席伦敦会议，可见这方面的协调工作已有所进展。
    从发展趋势看，欧佩克和非欧佩克产油国之间的对话将会继续下去。因为，今后要想把油价长期稳定在一个合理的水平上，除了欧佩克需认真执行减产协议外，非欧佩克产油国的积极合作也显得越来越重要。舍此，任何一方的努力最终都有可能半途而废。
