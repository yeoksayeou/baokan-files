	Yeltsin Urges Soviet People Not to Lose Faith in Reform

	Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 31 — The First Deputy Chairman of the Soviet State Construction Committee, Yeltsin, called on Soviet people not to lose faith in reform and not to be indifferent or timid about it.

	He emphasized at the same time that the leadership should let the people taste the actual results of the reform as soon as possible.

	The Komsomolskaya Pravda today published his remarks.

	After being removed from his positions as a candidate member of the Politburo of the CPSU Central Committee and the First Secretary of the Moscow City Committee in October 1987 for delivering a speech deemed to contain "political errors," Yeltsin has continued to express his views in the press and expounded his ideas at the CPSU Party Conference this summer. Many of his views have aroused great interest among Soviet people.

	Yeltsin insisted on concentrating efforts on developing commerce, public catering, consumer goods production, and services for residents, believing that it is possible to scale down the costly space programs and defense industries to free up funds.

	He pointed out that if the people do not benefit from the reform, the reform will not succeed.

	He firmly advocated the complete abolition of certain privileges and benefits enjoyed by some leaders, but opposed egalitarianism.

　　叶利钦呼吁苏联人
    不要丧失对改革的信心
    新华社莫斯科１２月３１日电  苏联国家建委第一副主席叶利钦呼吁苏联人不要失去对改革的信心，对改革不要无动于衷和胆小怕事。
    他同时强调，领导应让人民尽快尝到改革的实际成果。
    《共青团真理报》今天刊登了他的谈话。
    叶利钦因１９８７年１０月因发表了被称为有“政治错误”的言论而被解除苏共中央政治局候补委员和莫斯科市委第一书记职务后，仍不时在报刊上发表政见，并于今夏在苏共党代表会议上阐述自己的主张。他的不少观点引起苏联人浓厚的兴趣。
    叶利钦坚持集中力量发展商业、公共饮食业、消费品生产和居民服务业，认为可以收缩耗资巨大的航天计划和国防事业，以腾出资金。
    他指出，如果人民得不到改革带来的实惠，改革就不会成功。
    他坚决主张彻底取消某些领导干部的特权和优惠，但反对平均主义。
