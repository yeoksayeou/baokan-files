Shanghai has a number of lawless individual households whose tax evasion is becoming increasingly severe, with criminal cases on the rise, causing strong discontent among citizens. The Shanghai Municipal Government has listed this issue as a major agenda item and is mobilizing the entire city to take effective measures to severely punish these offenses.

Shanghai has over 90,000 individual households registered with the tax authorities. According to investigations by relevant departments, the rate of tax evasion reaches 70%. A minority of lawless elements use illegal means to gain huge profits, and their attitudes are arrogant, boasting that they can evade taxes if they can, and resist if they must. In the past four months, there have been over 40 criminal cases involving economic crimes that have resulted in criminal prosecutions, with tax evasion amounting to over 10 million yuan. After becoming rich through illegal means, these individuals lead extravagant lives, flaunting their wealth in public, which has caused strong discontent among workers, peasants, and intellectuals.

In the near future, the procuratorial and tax authorities at the municipal and district levels in Shanghai will strengthen their cooperation, take the initiative to crack down, and severely punish those who evade large amounts of taxes and commit serious crimes. This will change the situation of "punishing instead of prosecuting" and lax law enforcement.

　　上海个体户偷漏税严重
    检察税务机关将予严惩
    本报上海电  上海有一批不法个体户偷税漏税日趋严重，犯罪案件增多，引起市民强烈不满。上海市府已将此事列入重要议程，动员全市力量采取有力措施，加以严惩。
    上海市个体户经税务登记有９万多户，据有关方面调查，偷税漏税面达７０％。少数不法分子依靠不法手段获取暴利，而且态度嚣张，扬言对政府能偷则偷，能抗则抗。近４个月，因经济犯罪案追究刑事责任的共４０多件，偷税金额达百万元。这些人在暴富后，生活上挥霍无度，招摇过市，引起工人、农民、知识分子强烈不满。
    在近期内，上海市市区两级检察部门及税务部门将加强配合，主动出击，从严惩处偷税数额大、情节恶劣的犯罪分子，改变“以罚代刑”、执法不严的状况。
