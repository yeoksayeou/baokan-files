God Needs Art Masterpieces

Recently, I met the editor of *Selected Essays*, and I asked him about the magazine's prospects for the coming year. When I asked, I secretly worried that the number of subscriptions delivered by the post office would drop, as all magazines were experiencing a significant decline. However, to my surprise, he replied that subscriptions had increased by more than ten percent, exceeding fifty thousand.

My heart warmed. God has eyes after all! If we acknowledge that readers are God, then the aesthetic level of Chinese readers, using other jargon, can be said to have declined but also risen. This can be corroborated by the sensation caused by the Beijing People's Art Theatre's performance in Shanghai. This has given some comfort to disheartened artists and provided editors, publishers, and distributors with an enlightenment: God needs art masterpieces.

In recent years, everyone has been somewhat confused and bewildered. This is especially true for those who make a living from writing, including writers, editors, publishers, and sellers.

Looking at the cultural situation, we used to be accustomed to schools, classrooms, libraries, and theaters. Now there have been changes, and we need to look at the market trends for newspapers, magazines, and books. Everyone has acquired an additional attribute: businessman.

This is not necessarily bad or wrong. Whether from the perspective of reception studies, cultural economics, or economic culture, or from the perspective of the survival, sustenance, and development of cultural people, this is the case.

However, a serious challenge is presented to this group of people: works that saw a straight-line increase in subscriptions and a bullish trend a few years ago have seen a sharp decline in subscriptions and a bearish trend in the past two years. What has soared are the costs of printing, publishing, and distribution.

There is a philosophical view on this challenge: it's not a big deal. Chinese people, especially Chinese intellectuals, have experienced all kinds of disasters and calamities. Besides, the sea has tides, and water has ebbs and flows, which is normal; market trends have ups and downs, which is also not strange. It is like a person's taste: after eating bland food for a long time, one wants to eat big fish and meat; after eating fish and meat to the point of boredom, one finds coarse grains and vegetables refreshing. Follow nature, let the ups and downs be, let the rise and fall be.

But how do we follow nature?

The ancient question of "down-to-earth people" versus "elegant literature" is raised again. This time, however, it is quite different from the fashion of the Song Dynasty or the Yan'an era. The trend of advocating that modern readers' aesthetic tastes have changed, that elegant literature and artworks are few and far between, and that vulgar literature and non-artworks are on the rise is very fashionable. Many people have flocked to produce popular works, with sex and violence as the main content, shallow and crude as the basic characteristics, and targeting the stimulation of the cultural stratum and readers with low aesthetic tastes. Such newspapers, magazines, and books have flooded the book market. Perhaps God also has moments of confusion. The information feedback indeed proves that the advocacy is not false. In China, the number of people at this level is very large, and they can be called "the masses." Because of their narrow knowledge and curiosity, they are easily satisfied and willing to pay to be stimulated. Therefore, the "input" is not much, but the "output" is abundant, and the economic benefits are excellent.

This is a kind of adaptation, although it does not lack serious explorers of popular art, but a considerable part of people's purpose can be summarized as: whether it is art or not, the only goal is profit.

Of course, there is another kind of adaptation. God has indeed broken away from mediocrity. God indeed loves good things. Among the tens of millions of readers, no matter how the social and economic situation changes, there will always be some people who love art, are passionate about literature, transcend vulgarity, especially the extremely large number of student youth and intellectuals, they need masterpieces. Moreover, the lower strata of readers will also change, and the trend of reading from vulgar to elegant is one of them. Just as goods have high, medium, and low grades, books and magazines should also be like this. Therefore, quietly insisting on producing high-grade spiritual products is also a kind of adaptation. This adaptation may not immediately succeed in the book market that is rapidly changing after the opening of the forbidden zone, but it will succeed and will have great success. Remember, there is an old saying in China: "From evil like a collapse, from good like an ascent." It is easy to make inferior products, but it is difficult to create masterpieces. When society is tired of vulgar works and calls for artworks, those artworks are not something that can be easily obtained. And those who have been working hard to create and publish artworks will show their foresight.

I am not pretending to be elegant and acting like a nobleman to criticize "vulgarity." I am actually deeply sympathetic to the troubles of editors and publishers. What I am worried about is that people are intoxicated by a moment of "economic success," mistakenly believing that this is the modern person's appreciation taste and aesthetic level, mistakenly believing that this is the normal way to please and satisfy, mistakenly believing that life can go on like this, and only when the situation turns around, they will wake up from their dream and regret it too late!

In fact, the situation of literature and art under a commodity economy, we have all seen, and it is not entirely a new problem. Looking back forty years vertically, and looking outward horizontally to the vast Western world, it is a commodity economy. Artists and editors, publishers in the large environment of a commodity economy, cannot but consider the issue of money, the issue of economic benefits, but at the same time, they also need to consider the social benefits of their work, consider their reputation during their lifetime, consider their life value and responsibility to humanity. Thus, through their hands, they built cultural palaces one after another, left artistic treasures one after another, and passed down batches of spiritual food rich in nutrition. So that modern people read the great books of the May Fourth pioneers, study the masterpieces of Westerners in various fields, often admire them to the point of sighing and lamenting: as a generation of elites, they did not disappoint their times; as thinkers and cultural people in humanity, they did not live in vain, they left treasures that can nourish future generations.

If we cannot compare more with them, create more cultural and artistic masterpieces, one day when God blames and punishes us, what face will we have, what excuse will we have?

### “上帝”需要艺术精品

　　“上帝”需要艺术精品
    孙荪
    日前见到《散文选刊》主编，问起明年“生意”如何。我问时暗自担心邮局送来的订数是下降，因为各刊都是大幅度滑坡。但出乎意料，答曰上升百分之十几，订数逾五万。
    我心中一热。上帝究竟有眼！如果承认读者是上帝的话。中国读者的审美层次套用别的行话总算是降中有升了。这与北京人艺赴沪演出引起的轰动可以互为参证。多少给寒心的文艺家们以温热，也给编辑出版发行家们以启示：上帝需要艺术精品。
    近年大家都有些迷茫和困惑了。尤其是以文为生的人们，这包括写家、编家、出家、卖家。
    看文化形势，过去习惯于到校园、课堂、图书馆、剧院。现在有了变化，要看报刊书籍市场行情。大家都多出了一个属性：生意人。
    这并没有什么不好，或不对。无论从接受学的角度，还是从文化经济学抑或经济文化学的角度，更有文化人的生存温饱发展的角度。
    但是，一个严峻的挑战摆到这个人群面前：前些年订数直线上升行情看涨的作品，这两年订数锐减行情看跌，飞涨的是印刷出版发行费用。
    对挑战有一种达观之论：没有什么大不了的。中国人尤其是中国文人什么样的大灾大难没经历过？何况，海有潮汐，水有涨落，本是常态；市场行情，有升有降，亦不奇怪。也如人的口味，清淡久了想吃大鱼大肉，鱼肉吃腻了见了粗粮菜蔬转觉新鲜。顺其自然，涨跌由它，生灭由它。
    但，如何顺应自然呢？
    下里巴人与阳春白雪的古老命题又重提出来了。只是这一次与宋玉时代、与延安时代的时尚都大不同。倡言现代读者审美趣味改变，雅文学、艺术品曲高和寡，俗文学、非艺术品看涨乃必然趋势的调子很行时。许多人一窝蜂地经营起通俗作品，以性与暴力为主要内容，以浅露粗劣为基本特点，以刺激文化阶层和审美趣味偏低的读者为目标的报刊书籍竟至充斥书籍市场。大概上帝也有糊涂的时候。信息反馈还真证明其倡言不虚。在中国这一层次人数甚多，堪称“大众”，以其闻见狭隘，耽于好奇，又极易满足，故甘掏腰包愿受刺激。所以“投入”不多，“产出”却丰，经济效益极佳。
    这是一种顺应，其中虽然不乏严肃的通俗文艺探索者，但相当一部分人的宗旨可以概括为：管它艺术不艺术，唯利是图。
    当然，还有另一种顺应。上帝毕竟脱出了平庸。上帝毕竟喜欢好东西。亿万读者中无论社会经济形势如何天翻地覆，总有一些人酷爱艺术，醉心文学，超脱庸俗，尤其数量极大的学生青年和知识阶层，他们需要精品。况且，读者群中较低阶层者也会变化，读书由俗入雅也是趋势之一。如同商品有高中低档，书刊亦应如此。因此，默默地坚持生产高档精神产品也是一种顺应。这种顺应在禁区初开、迅急突变的书刊市场面前不一定会马上成功，但它会成功，并将会有很大成功。须知中国有句老话：从恶如崩，从善如登。制造劣品易，创造精品难。当社会腻烦了庸俗作品，呼唤艺术品的时候，那艺术品可不是可以手到擒来的。而一直用心创造和出版艺术品者的远见就显示出来了。
    我并非自命高雅，作贵族状骂倒“俗流”。我倒是深为理解编辑家出版家的苦恼。我担心的是人们被一时的“经济上的成功”所陶醉，误以为这就是现代人的欣赏趣味审美层次，误以为这样取悦投合就是正常的服务，误以为日子照这样下去还可以过，等到形势转过来，才如梦初醒，悔之已晚！
    其实，商品经济下的文艺境遇，我们都见过，并不全是新问题。纵的往上推４０年，横的往外推向西方广大世界，都是商品经济。文艺家和编辑家出版家们在商品经济的大环境下，不能不考虑钱的问题，经济效益问题，但同时，他们也要考虑他们工作的社会效益，考虑他们的生前身后之名，考虑他们的人生价值和对人类的责任。于是，经由他们的手建造了一个个文化殿堂，留下了一个个艺术珍品，传下来一批批具有丰富营养的精神食粮。以至现代人捧读五四先哲们的大书，研讨西人在各个领域中的杰构，常常倾慕不已以至唏嘘慨叹：作为一代精英，他们没有辜负自己的时代；作为人类中的思想者文化人，他们没有白活一世，他们留下了可以哺育后人的珍宝。
    如果我们不能更多地和他们相比，多创造一些文化艺术精品，有一天上帝责怪和惩罚我们，我们有何面目、有何辩白呢？
