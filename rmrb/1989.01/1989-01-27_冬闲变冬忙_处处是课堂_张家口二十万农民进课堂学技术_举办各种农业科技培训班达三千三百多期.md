Since winter, hundreds of thousands of farmers in Zhangjiakou, Hebei Province, who have been working in the fields from spring to autumn, have entered rural agricultural schools, cultural stations, youth homes, and agricultural vocational schools to learn agricultural science and technology. In just two months, 3,308 agricultural technology training classes have been held, training 236,000 farmers.

Following the conclusion of the National Rural Work Conference, the Zhangjiakou Regional Party Committee and the Regional Government have carefully planned to secure bumper harvests for the next two years, considering the increase in intellectual investment and the improvement of farmers' scientific and technological literacy as one of the fundamental measures. They decided to use the winter and spring leisure season in rural areas to carry out large-scale agricultural technology training throughout the region.

The region established a training leadership group and divided the training plan among 14 government departments and mass organizations. In the face of tight local finances, the region allocated 800,000 yuan as training funds, with the remaining amount to be covered by the counties. The entire region also mobilized and organized 1,476 scientific and technological personnel to go to the countryside to give lectures and organized more than 1,100 rural "local experts" to share their skills on stage.

In carrying out agricultural science and technology training, Zhangjiakou region adheres to the principles of "practicality, applicability, and effectiveness," focusing on key projects for agricultural development and key projects for scientific and technological promotion over the next two years. Huailai County has made the 10 new agricultural technologies that will be widely promoted this year, such as plastic film cultivation, high-yield agricultural field standardized cultivation, and formula fertilization, the main content of the training. Zhuolu County, in order to achieve a bumper grain harvest this year, decided to popularize the "yield-increasing bacteria" technology in all grain-producing areas of the county. Through training classes, on-site demonstrations, and the distribution of technical materials, more than 1,000 farmers have mastered the technology of using "yield-increasing bacteria."

　　冬闲变冬忙　处处是课堂    
    张家口二十万农民进课堂学技术     
    举办各种农业科技培训班达三千三百多期
    本报讯  入冬以来，河北省张家口地区成千上万在田间从春到秋劳动的农民走进乡村农技校、文化站、青年之家以及农职学校，学习农业科技知识。仅两个月的时间，就举办各种农技培训班３３０８期，受训农民达２３．６万人。
    全国农村工作会议结束后，张家口地委、行署对夺取今明两年农业丰收进行了认真的部署，把增加智力投入、提高农民科技素质作为治本措施之一，并决定利用冬春农村的闲暇季节，在全区开展大规模的农业技术培训。
    地区成立了培训领导小组，并把培训农民的计划分解到１４个政府职能部门和群众团体。在地方财力紧张的情况下，地区挤出８万元资金作为培训费，不足部分由各县解决。全区还动员组织了１４７６名科技人员下乡讲课，组织了１１００多名农村土专家登台传授技艺。
    张家口地区在开展农业科技培训中，坚持“实际、实用、实效”的原则，围绕今明两年发展农业的重点项目和科技推广的重点项目进行培训。怀来县把今年将大面积推广的地膜栽培、高效益农田规范化栽培、配方施肥等１０项农业新技术，作为培训的主要内容。涿鹿县为了夺得今年粮食丰收，决定在全县粮食产区普及“增产菌”使用技术。通过办班传授、现场示范、印发技术资料，使１０００多名农民掌握了“增产菌”使用技术。
