	To Our Readers

	The "Ten Years of Rural Reform" essay contest, which lasted for four months, received over three thousand submissions from authors across the country. After careful selection, twenty-eight essays were chosen for publication; fifteen of these were further awarded first, second, and third prizes. Today, we are officially announcing the results. We extend our heartfelt thanks to all the authors who participated in this contest and to our wide readership.

	The submissions for this essay contest provided a multi-faceted and concentrated reflection on the profound changes brought about by ten years of rural reform. Each person, each event, and each scene described in the essays shines with the spirit of change and is filled with the authors' passionate praise for the reforms. Ten years of rural reform have provided us with an abundance of material for understanding, whether it be successful experiences or problems that still need to be addressed. Deeply understanding the past ten years and the new situation before us, which is full of both hope and confusion, is a meaningful and far-from-completed task.

	An era of change inevitably brings with it confusion and reflection. Facing the new situation where agricultural production, particularly grain and cotton, has stagnated for four years, we need to think calmly and deeply. Why has agriculture stagnated? Has the potential of the "Household Responsibility System" been fully tapped? How should rural reform deepen? How can it deepen? A series of new questions need to be addressed through practice and answered.

	Looking back at this essay contest, one regret is that the analysis of the current contradictions and problems facing China's rural reform and development is insufficient, and the summarization of new experiences from ten years of reform is lacking. In the new year, we hope to work with everyone to write more on this topic, including organizing similar essay contests and discussions, to make up for the shortcomings of this contest.

	For the authors who won prizes in this contest, we will issue certificates and prize money. For the remaining authors who did not win prizes, we will also issue commemorative certificates.

	As the new year begins, we wish for a bountiful harvest in agriculture and hope that all the authors and readers working on the front lines of agriculture will achieve new successes!

　　告读者
    “农村改革已十年”征文活动历时四个月，先后收到来自全国各地三千多名作者的来稿，百里挑一，选择了二十八篇见报；最后又从中评出一、二、三等好稿共十五篇。今天，予以正式公布。我们谨向参加这次征文的作者以及广大读者表示衷心的感谢。
    这次征文的来稿，多角度多侧面而又集中地反映了农村改革十年的深刻变化。文中一人一事，一情一景，无不闪烁着变革精神的光芒，饱含着作者对改革的热情讴歌。农村改革十年，给人们提供的认识材料，无论是成功经验还是有待解决的问题，都是太丰富了。深刻认识过去这十年以及呈现在我们面前充满希望与困惑的新形势，是一项极富意义而又远未完成的工作。
    变革的时代，必然伴随着困惑和反思。面对农业主要是粮食、棉花生产发生四年徘徊的新情况，尤其需要我们冷静地沉思。农业为什么徘徊不前？“大包干”潜力是否已经用尽？农村改革向哪里深入？怎样深入？一系列新的问题，需要实践，需要回答。
    回头总结我们这次征文，比较遗憾的一点是，对当前我国农村改革与发展面临的矛盾、问题分析得不够，总结十年改革的新鲜经验不够。在新的一年里，我们有志和大家一起在这方面多做点文章，包括开展类似的征文、讨论活动，弥补这次的不足。
    在这次征文中获奖的同志，我们将分别颁发获奖证书和奖金。对未能获奖的其余十几位作者，也将颁发纪念证书。
    新年伊始，我们预祝农业丰收，愿工作在农业第一线的广大作者和读者创造新的成绩！
