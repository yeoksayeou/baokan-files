The stock system, which has been piloted in some cities and enterprises in China for the past five years, is beginning to take shape. According to incomplete statistics, since the establishment of the first stock company in China—Beijing Tianqiao Department Store Stock Company Limited—in 1984, there are now over 6,000 stock companies nationwide, with a total capital raising of over 6 billion yuan. In line with the piloting of the stock system, securities markets and stock trading markets have also begun to be set up in some major cities.

China's economic theory circles are paying considerable attention to the fate and prospects of the pilot stock companies. In the recently published book "China's Reform Grand Strategy," many articles suggest that, in the long run, China's enterprises need to gradually implement the stock system. A person from the State Commission for Economic Restructuring described the stock system as an advanced form of enterprise organization in a commodity economy society.

Among the enterprises in China that have piloted the stock system, there are both state-owned and collective enterprises, as well as individual and "three types of capital" enterprises. The industries involved are quite broad. The specific forms are also varied: there are group stock systems, joint venture stock systems, internal shareholding systems, social fundraising systems, financial stock systems, composite stock systems, and other forms. There are also combinations with other enterprise reform methods, such as leasehold stock systems and contract stock systems. In practice, all public-owned enterprises that have implemented the stock system have maintained the dominant position of socialist public ownership. This is because, in these enterprises, the state and collectives hold a significant proportion of the shares, and the workers' sense of ownership has not weakened but rather strengthened. The enterprises operate on the principle of combining distribution according to labor with distribution according to shares. Experts believe that the stock system with public ownership as the main body will be the direction for the development of China's stock economy in the future.

Economists summarize the main functions of implementing the stock system into four points: raising funds, sharing risks, facilitating the separation of ownership and management, and enhancing workers' sense of ownership.

From the overall situation of various places, the stock system in China, although it has just started, still has many problems, but it indeed brings vitality to China's economy and has a good development prospect.

### 主体为公有制　形式呈多样化  全国股份制企业逾六千家

　　主体为公有制　形式呈多样化
    全国股份制企业逾六千家
    据新华社北京１月２日电  （记者徐克洪）５年前开始在我国部分城市和企业试行的股份制目前已初露形态。据不完全统计，继国内第一家股份公司——北京天桥百货股份有限公司于１９８４年成立之后，全国至今已有股份制企业６０００多家，股份集资额６０多亿元。与股份制的试行相适应，证券市场、股票交易市场也开始在一些大城市中试办。
    我国经济理论界对试行股份制企业的命运和前景相当重视。在最近出版的《中国改革大思路》一书中，有相当多的文章认为，从长远来看，我国企业需要逐步推行股份制。国家体改委的一位人士称股份制为商品经济社会中的高级企业组织形式。
    我国试行股份制的企业里，既有全民、集体所有制企业，也有个体、“三资”企业，行业分布比较广泛。具体形式也很多：有集团股份制、合资股份制、内部入股制、社会集资制、金融股份制、复合型股份制等，还有与其它企业改革形式结合起来的租赁股份制、承包股份制等。从实践中看，所有试行股份制的公有制企业都坚持了社会主义公有制的主导地位。这是因为：在这些企业中，国家和集体均持有很大比例的股份，职工的主人翁意识并无削弱反而增强；企业实行的是按劳分配与按股分红相结合的分配原则。有关专家据此认为，以公有制为主体的股份制将是今后我国股份经济发展的方向。
    经济界人士把实行股份制的主要作用归纳为４点：筹集资金，分担风险，有利于两权分离，可以增强职工的主人翁意识。
    综合各地的情况看，股份制在我国虽然才刚刚起步，还存在不少问题，但的确给我国经济带来活力，有良好的发展前景。
