All Party Comrades Must Withstand the Test of Reform and Opening Up
	Zhao Ziyang Proposes Strengthening Party Building
	Currently, Focus on Tightly Grasping the Three Issues of Clean Governance, Party Cohesion, and the Party's Attractiveness

	BEIJING, Jan. 28 (Xinhua) -- CPC Central Committee General Secretary Zhao Ziyang said today at Zhongnanhai that strengthening party building requires focusing on the three issues of clean governance, party cohesion, and the party's attractiveness.

	Zhao Ziyang made these remarks during a discussion with comrades attending the Central Party Building Research Class and the National Discipline Inspection Work Conference.

	He said that over the past decade of reform, China's various undertakings have developed under the leadership of the Party. The Party's line is correct. There have been many new innovations in various aspects of work. Generally speaking, party organizations at all levels have combat effectiveness, and the vast majority of party members work hard for the people. However, there are indeed phenomena of corruption and disintegration within the party, which, if left unchecked, will spread like a plague. Now, we are in a historical period of great transformation. Some people do not understand, and some people cannot withstand the test. All party comrades must be fully prepared in terms of ideology and have sufficient confidence to withstand the test of reform and opening up. This requires us to strictly govern the party and strengthen party building.

	Zhao Ziyang said that the work of party committees boils down to two main tasks: one is to promote the development of socialist commodity economy, and the other is to focus on ideological and political work. In the ideological and political realm, the key is to strengthen party building. If we can grasp and do well these two tasks, the party will be able to lead and control the overall situation. He emphasized: Building socialism with Chinese characteristics requires promoting the development of socialist commodity economy, but it is not enough to just focus on economic development without paying attention to ideological and political work. Similarly, it is not enough to just focus on ideological and political work without strengthening party building. Therefore, party committees at all levels must place party building on the important agenda.

	Zhao Ziyang said that our party is the ruling party. The more prosperous the economy is, the more developed the socialist commodity economy is, the higher the awareness of clean governance among Communist Party members should be, and the stricter the party's discipline should be in this regard. The Communist Party must not make the mistake of trading power for money. Preventing the trading of power for money is one of the basic requirements for establishing a new order in the socialist commodity economy.

	He pointed out that strengthening party building requires enhancing the party's cohesion both ideologically and organizationally. We must combine the current situation with the in-depth study of the theory and line of the 13th Party Congress, adhere to the four cardinal principles, and adhere to reform and opening up, so that the party can always maintain a strong cohesion and lead the people of the whole country to continuously advance the four modernizations.

	Zhao Ziyang stressed that we must strengthen and improve party leadership and enhance the party's attractiveness among the masses. The leadership of the Communist Party is in the fundamental interests of the people of the whole country. The party must truly govern the party. After the separation of party and government, party committees at the county level and above should strengthen political leadership in major policies and concentrate on party building and reform. Party leading cadres at all levels should strive to learn the basic knowledge of Marxism-Leninism, the basic theory and line of the party, and the basic knowledge of the party. Every Communist Party member should strengthen the party's consciousness and party spirit, frequently carry out criticism and self-criticism, strengthen unity, and strictly observe discipline.

	He also gave his opinions on how to strengthen party organizational building.

	Earlier, Zhao Ziyang had three discussions with the provincial and autonomous region party committee secretaries and old comrades attending the party building research class, and visited the entire class with Qiao Shi and Song Ping.

　　全党同志一定要经得起改革开放的考验    
    赵紫阳提出必须加强党的建设    
    当前要紧紧抓好廉政、党内凝聚力和党的吸引力三个问题
    新华社北京１月２８日电（记者孙本尧）中共中央总书记赵紫阳今天在中南海说，加强党的建设，当前要紧紧抓好廉政、党内凝聚力和党的吸引力三个问题。
    赵紫阳是在同参加中央党的建设研究班和全国纪律检查工作会议的同志座谈时提出这一看法的。
    他说，改革十年来，我国各项事业的大发展是在党的领导下进行的。党的路线是正确的。各方面的工作都有不少新的创造。各级党组织从总体上来说是有战斗力的，绝大多数党员是为人民努力工作的。但是，党内也确实存在腐败和涣散现象，放任下去是会泛滥成灾的。现在，我们正处在历史性的大转变时期，有的人不理解，有的人经不起考验。全党同志要有充分的思想准备和足够的信心，一定要经得起改革开放的考验。这就要求我们必须从严治党，加强党的建设。
    赵紫阳说，党委的工作千条万条，归根到底是两手抓：一手抓发展社会主义商品经济，一手抓思想政治领域的工作，而在思想政治领域中，关键是抓好党的建设。这两手抓住了，抓好了，党就能够提纲挈领，驾驭全局。他着重指出：建设有中国特色的社会主义，不抓发展社会主义商品经济不行，抓发展商品经济不抓思想政治领域的工作不行，抓思想政治领域的工作不抓党的建设不行。所以，各级党委必须把加强党的建设摆在重要议事日程上来。
    赵紫阳说，我们党是执政党。经济越繁荣，社会主义商品经济越发展，共产党员保持廉政的觉悟就应该越高，党的纪律在这方面的要求和约束应该越严。共产党决不能犯拿权力和金钱作交易的错误。制止拿权力和金钱作交易，是建立社会主义商品经济新秩序的基本要求之一。
    他指出，加强党的建设必须从思想上组织上加强党的凝聚力。我们要结合形势深入进行十三大理论和路线的教育，坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放，使党经常保持强大的凝聚力，带领全国人民不断把四化建设推向前进。
    赵紫阳强调，一定要加强和改善党的领导，增强党在群众中的吸引力。共产党的领导是全国人民的根本利益所在。党要真正管党。党政分开后，县以上党委要加强重大方针政策的政治领导，集中力量抓好党的建设、抓好改革。党的各级领导班子要努力学习马列主义基本知识、党的基本理论和路线、党的基本知识。每一个共产党员，都要增强党的观念和党性，经常开展批评与自我批评，加强团结，严守纪律。
    他还就如何加强党的组织建设发表了意见。
    在此之前，赵紫阳曾同参加党的建设研究班的省、自治区委书记和老同志进行了三次座谈，并与乔石、宋平同志一起到中央党校看望了研究班全体同志。
