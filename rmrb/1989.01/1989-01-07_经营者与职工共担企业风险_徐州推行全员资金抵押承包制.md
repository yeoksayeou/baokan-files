Entrepreneurs and workers share enterprise risks
Xuzhou implements full-employee fund pledge contract system

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, January 6 - (Reporter Luozheng) Jiangsu Province's Xuzhou City has introduced a risk mechanism into enterprises by implementing a full-employee fund pledge contract responsibility system across the city.

The full-employee fund pledge contract system involves both the enterprise's managers and all employees pledging a certain amount of risk capital to the enterprise based on the enterprise's scale, operational risks, and individual responsibilities. The pledge amount ranges from 400 to 2,000 yuan. When the enterprise fully completes all contract indicators, the pledge capital participates in the enterprise's annual interest and dividend distribution. When the enterprise fails to meet the contract indicators or incurs a certain level of loss, the pledge capital is used to offset the loss, compensating for the shortfall until it is fully covered. If the enterprise fails to meet the monthly plan for two consecutive months, the workers' congress has the right to recommend changing the contractor. After examination by both contracting parties and relevant departments such as auditing and notarization, if it is confirmed that the contractor is at fault, the contract will be terminated, and the contractor's pledge capital will be fully owned by the enterprise.

A responsible person from Xuzhou City's Reform Office said that the full-employee fund pledge contract system can use the bond of interests to make the contractor and workers jointly responsible for the enterprise's performance, overcoming the contractor's "managing by contract" and the enterprise's "profiting without losing," as well as the employment mentality among workers.

This new contract form first appeared in Xuzhou City's Pei County Supply and Marketing Cooperative at the beginning of last year. Within half a year, this method was promoted in the county's supply and marketing system, commercial system, and 10 townships' more than 150 enterprises. Subsequently, the Xuzhou City Government took the promotion of the full-employee fund pledge contract as a key point for deepening enterprise reform and successively carried out pilot projects in various counties, districts, and systems.

The full-employee fund pledge contract changes individual contracting to full-employee contracting, organically tying the workers and the enterprise's risks and benefits together. Various enterprises also implemented supporting reforms such as streamlining organizations and optimizing labor combinations within the enterprise. Xuzhou City's Grain Bureau's automobile team implemented the full-employee fund pledge contract in September last year. In that month alone, the transportation income reached 174,600 yuan, a 20.7% increase over the average income of the first eight months. The four enterprises in Pei City that were loss-making in 1987 turned a profit within just three months after implementing the full-employee fund pledge contract.

　　经营者与职工共担企业风险
  　徐州推行全员资金抵押承包制
    新华社南京１月６日电  （记者罗政）江苏省徐州市把风险机制引入企业，在全市推行了全员资金抵押承包责任制。
    全员资金抵押承包，即企业承包经营者和全体职工都要按企业规模、经营风险、个人责任的大小，向企业抵押一定数量的风险资金，抵押金从４００元至２０００元不等。当企业全面完成各项承包指标时，抵押金参与企业年终付息分红。当企业完不成承包指标或出现一定幅度的亏损时，抵押金用于抵补亏损，缺多少补多少，直至全额抵补。企业连续半年完不成月度计划，职工代表大会有权建议更换承包人。经发包双方和审计、公证等部门审查，确属承包人责任的，予以中止承包合同，承包人的抵押金全部归企业所有。
    徐州市体改办负责人说，全员资金抵押承包，能以利益纽带使承包经营者与职工对企业的经营好坏共同负责，克服承包者“以包代管”，承包企业“负盈不负亏”以及职工中的雇佣思想。
    这一新的承包形式，早在去年年初就出现在徐州市沛县供销社。此后半年时间内，这个县的供销系统、商业系统以及１０个乡镇的１５０多个企业先后推广了这一办法。随后，徐州市政府又把推行全员资金抵押承包作为深化企业改革的重点，陆续在各县区、各系统展开了试点。
    全员资金抵押承包变一人承包为全员承包，把职工和企业的风险、利益有机地捆在一起。各企业还在内部实行了精简机构、优化劳动组合等配套改革。徐州市粮食局汽车队去年９月份实行全员资金抵押承包，当月运输收入达到１７．４６万元，比头８月的平均收入增长２０．７％。沛城镇１９８７年亏损的四家企业实行全员资金抵押承包后，短短３个月时间，便全部扭亏为盈。
