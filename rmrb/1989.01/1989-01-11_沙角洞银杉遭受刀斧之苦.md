In 1979, 58 silver fir trees that had survived the fourth glacial period were discovered in Shaojiao Cave in our county. The counties of Xinning and ours had a legal dispute over the ownership of these silver fir trees for 6 years. In 1986, the original Shaoyang region made a ruling: the 8,200 mu of mountains and forests surrounding the silver fir trees in Shaojiao Cave are to be managed by our county.

Since then, these 58 silver fir trees have been subjected to axe cuts and knife slashes. Nine of the silver fir trees have had their bark stripped and holes dug in them; one silver fir tree, after having a hole dug in it, was blown down by the wind; one national first-class protected long-cone pine was burned and fell over. Some people even uprooted the wild silver fir seedlings and cut off the branches bearing fruit. We appeal to the relevant departments to take measures to protect these silver fir trees.

　　沙角洞银杉遭受刀斧之苦
    １９７９年，我县沙角洞发现５８株经过第四纪冰川袭击后幸存下来的银杉。新宁县和我县为这些银杉的权属问题，整整打了６年官司。１９８６年，原邵阳地区作出裁决：银杉所在地沙角洞周围８２００亩山林，归我县管理。
    从此，这５８棵银杉便遭到斧砍刀割，有９棵银杉被人刮皮，挖洞；有１棵银杉挖洞后被风吹倒；有１棵属国家一类保护的长苞铁杉被烧后倒伏。有人还拔走野生的银杉苗，剪走结有果实的银杉枝。呼吁有关部门采取措施，保护这些银杉。
