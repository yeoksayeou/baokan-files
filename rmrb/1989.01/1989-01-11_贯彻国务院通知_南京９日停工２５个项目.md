	Implementing the State Council's Notice: Nanjing Halts 25 Projects on January 9

	People's Daily, Nanjing, January 10 – Reporter Gong Yongquan reports: After the State Council issued the notice on further cleaning up fixed asset investment projects under construction, the Nanjing municipal government paid great attention to it. For the nine categories of projects that must be halted and cleaned up by January 10 as stipulated in the notice, they strictly followed the requirements to "match the items." At the emergency meeting held on January 9, attended by responsible comrades from various counties, districts, commissions, offices, and directly affiliated units of the municipality, the municipal government announced the halt of 25 ongoing projects, reducing investments by 40.97 million yuan. The projects halted and cleaned up this time are mainly general processing industrial projects with outdated technology, low-level repetitive construction, environmental pollution, and poor investment returns. Among them, there are 18 industrial projects of the type of small cotton spinning, small chemical, and small fertilizer.

	So far, Nanjing has determined three batches of halted and suspended projects, totaling 99, with investments reduced by 737 million yuan. The relevant departments of the municipality are also actively improving and implementing the follow-up work for the first and second batches of halted and suspended projects, striving to minimize the losses.

　　贯彻国务院通知
    南京９日停工２５个项目
    本报南京１月１０日电  记者龚永泉报道：国务院关于进一步清理固定资产投资在建项目的通知发表后，南京市政府领导十分重视，对于９类规定在１０日前一律停工清理的项目，根据通知要求“对号入座”。在９日召开的各县、区，各委办局，市各直属单位负责同志参加的紧急会议上，市府宣布停工２５个在建项目，共压缩投资４０９７万元。这次停工清理的项目主要是工艺技术落后、低水平重复布点建设、污染环境、投资效益差的一般加工工业项目。其中，属于小棉纺、小化工、小化肥等类型的工业项目就有１８个。
    至此，南京市先后确定了三批停缓建项目，共９９个，压缩投资７．３７亿元。市有关部门还积极完善落实第一、二批停缓建项目的善后工作，力争把损失降到最低限度。
