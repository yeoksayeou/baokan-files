The Chinese water polo team, which has won three consecutive gold medals at the Asian Games, is currently undergoing a systematic rebuilding process. The team leader is Guan Yuezheng, and Peng Shaorong continues to serve as the head coach. The coach is He Xinfat, the former coach of the Guangxi youth team, and Zhang Wai'an from the Guangzhou Institute of Physical Education's water polo research room is the scientific researcher accompanying the team.

This rebuilding of the Chinese water polo team aims to prepare for the World University Games this year, the Asian Games next year, and the next Olympic Games, with the goal of striving to win the gold medal at the Asian Games again.

After the Seoul Olympics, the Chinese water polo team completed its "historical mission" and was disbanded. The decision-makers responsible for rebuilding the new team have selected 22 players, including 3 from Shanghai, 5 from Hunan, 5 from Guangdong, 5 from Guangxi, 2 from Guangzhou, and 2 from Sichuan. In addition to 5 veteran players, the rest are new faces. The new players will start training in Guangzhou on January 11th. After 3 months of training, the most outstanding players will be selected to form the national team.

Guan Yuezheng and Peng Shaorong, who recently arrived in Guangzhou, told reporters that to become a member of the Chinese water polo team, one must be prepared to make sacrifices and endure hardships. Comfort will not lead to winning the gold medal at the Asian Games.

    瞄准北京亚运会
    重组国家水球队
    本报广州１月５日电  曾荣获亚运会三连冠的中国水球队，目前正在有条不紊地进行重建工作。领队为关越铮，彭绍荣仍执掌主教练帅印，教练为原广西青年队教练何新发，广州体院水球研究室张外安为随队科研人员。
    此次重建中国水球队，备战今年世界大学生运动会、明年亚运会和下届奥运会，目标是力争再夺亚运会金牌。
    汉城奥运会后，中国水球队完成“历史使命”解散。负责组建新队的决策人员物色了２２名选手，其中上海３名，湖南５名，广东５名，广西５名，广州２名，四川２名。除５名老队员外，其余均为新面孔。新队员定于本月１１日起在广州集训，经过３个月训练后，再从中遴选精干队员组成国家队。
    日前抵达广州的关越铮和彭绍荣对记者说，想当中国水球队员，就要作出牺牲，准备吃苦，舒舒服服拿不到亚运会金牌。
