The industrial enterprises in Xiancheng County, Hebei Province, have universally implemented asset mortgage contracting. Entrepreneurs and workers share risks, which has enhanced the enterprises' operational vitality. In 1987, county-owned enterprises achieved a profit of 11.37 million yuan, and in 1988, this figure reached 23 million yuan.

This county has 32 county-owned enterprises. Starting in 1986, these enterprises gradually implemented contract-based management, incorporating worker risk mortgages and group guarantees as effective measures to further improve the contract responsibility system. The minimum amount for workers is 500 yuan, while factory directors must contribute between 4,000 and 10,000 yuan. Currently, 13 enterprises with over 3,800 workers have paid the risk funds. Common economic interests have united entrepreneurs and workers, receiving widespread approval from the enterprises.

The county's shoe factory, established in 1980, had changed six directors in seven years and accumulated losses of 350,000 yuan by 1986, bringing the enterprise to the brink of closure. In April 1987, the county government conducted a pilot program in this factory involving asset mortgages and group guarantees. The factory first focused on internal reform, reducing administrative personnel from 41 to 11. Simultaneously, it vigorously developed new products, with the entire factory working together. Within two months, the factory turned losses into profits, achieving a profit of 45,000 yuan in eight months.

　　经营者和职工共担风险共出力
    藁城工业资产抵押承包见成效
    本报讯  河北省藁城县工业企业普遍实行资产抵押，经营者、职工共担风险，使企业经营活力增强，１９８７年县办企业实现利润１１３７万元，１９８８年达２３００万元。
    这个县有县办企业３２个，１９８６年陆续实行承包经营，并把职工风险抵押、群体担保，作为进一步完善承包责任制的有力措施，职工最低限额为５００元，厂长则须交纳４０００至１万元，目前已有１３个企业３８００多名职工交纳了风险金。共同的经济利益把经营者、职工联结在一起，受到企业的普遍欢迎。
    县鞋厂自１９８０年建厂以来，７年换了６任厂长，到１９８６年累计亏损达３５万元，企业濒临倒闭。１９８７年４月，县政府在这个厂搞了资产抵押、群体担保的试点。全厂首先在企业内部配套改革上做文章，将行政人员从４１人精简到１１人；同时大力开发新产品，全厂上下拧成一股劲，两个月就扭亏为盈，８个月实现利润４．５万元。
