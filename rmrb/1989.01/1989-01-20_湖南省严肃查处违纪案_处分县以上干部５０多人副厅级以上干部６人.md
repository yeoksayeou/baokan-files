Hunan Province Seriously Investigates and Punishes Violations of Discipline

More than 50 county-level and above cadres, including 6 at the deputy bureau level and above, are punished

People's Daily reports: During the rectification and rectification, the Hunan Provincial Party Committee has seriously investigated and punished cases of violations of discipline by Party cadres, especially those involving leading organs and county-level and above leading cadres.

Since last October, the Hunan Provincial Party Committee has held five meetings of the Standing Committee, specifically discussing issues related to clean governance and the handling of major violations of discipline. The provincial, municipal, and county levels all regard their direct subordinate organs as the key to clean governance work. The Provincial Direct Commission has advocated for the "Serving the People, Promoting Reform, Creating a Clean Government" campaign in the provincial direct organs. At the same time, the Provincial Party Committee has paid attention to fully playing the role of the discipline inspection, supervision, and audit departments. The relevant departments have concentrated time and effort to promptly investigate a number of major violations of discipline, and punished a number of Party cadres who have committed violations of discipline. Among them, more than 50 county-level and above cadres, and 6 at the deputy bureau level and above.

The Hunan Provincial Party Committee emphasizes that in handling various violations of discipline, priority should be given to promptly handling major violations of discipline that are strongly reflected by the masses and hinder reform. At present, special attention should be paid to seriously investigating those who use their power to extort, accept bribes, speculate, blackmail, and waste. Recently, the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee and the responsible persons of the Provincial Government listened to the report on the situation of several major violations of discipline by the Provincial Supervision Bureau, and put forward opinions on the handling of the relevant persons and matters. Various levels of supervisory departments, while investigating violations of discipline related to taxation, finance, and prices, have also organized forces to investigate and punish some companies that have violated laws and regulations.

While seriously investigating and punishing violations of discipline by some Party cadres, the Hunan Provincial Party Committee pays great attention to improving the restraint mechanism, regarding clean governance as a major task for the whole Party, and reducing the soil that produces non-clean phenomena. The Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government have formulated the "Decision on Strengthening Clean Governance in Provincial Direct Organs" and the "Notice on Stopping Party and Government Cadres from Building Private Houses in Urban Areas and Investigating and Punishing Violations of Discipline in the Process of Building Private Houses" and other rules and regulations.

　　湖南省严肃查处违纪案
    处分县以上干部５０多人副厅级以上干部６人
    本报讯  湖南省委在治理整顿中，严肃查处党员干部的违纪案件，特别是涉及领导机关和县以上领导干部的违纪案件。
    去年１０月以来，湖南省委先后召开５次常委会议，专门研究廉政建设和重大违纪案件的查处问题。省、地、县三级都把直属机关作为廉政工作的重点。省直工委倡导在省直机关开展“当人民公仆，办改革实事，创廉洁机关”的活动。同时，省委注意充分发挥纪检、监察、审计等部门的职能作用，有关部门集中时间和力量，及时查处了一批重大违纪案件，处分了一批有违纪行为的党员干部，其中，县级以上干部５０多人，副厅级以上干部６人。
    湖南省委强调，在查处各种违纪案件时，从速查处群众反映强烈、妨碍改革的重大违纪案件。目前，特别要认真查处那些利用权力索贿受贿、倒买倒卖、敲诈勒索、挥霍浪费的严重违纪行为。最近，省委常委及省政府负责人听取了省监察厅对几起较大违纪案件的情况汇报，对有关的人和事提出了处理意见。各级监督部门在查处违反税收、财务、物价纪律的违纪行为的同时，对一些违纪违法的公司组织力量进行了查处。
    湖南省委在严肃查处少数党员干部违纪案件的同时，十分注意健全约束机制，把廉政建设作为全党的一件大事来抓，减少产生不廉现象的土壤。省委、省政府制订了《关于加强省直机关廉政工作的决定》、《关于制止党政机关干部在城镇自筹自建私房和查处建私房中违纪行为的通知》等规章制度。　（段林毅）
