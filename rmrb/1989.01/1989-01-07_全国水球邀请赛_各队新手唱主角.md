The National Water Polo Invitational Tournament, featuring six elite teams, kicked off yesterday in Guangzhou.

Following the Sixth National Games and the Twenty-Fourth Olympic Games, many veteran players have retired, prompting various provinces, municipalities, and districts to make significant adjustments to their water polo teams. The participating teams from Guangxi, Sichuan, Hunan, Guangzhou, and the host teams from Guangdong (one and two) are predominantly composed of newcomers. The competitive level among the teams is quite close, making the matches intense and thrilling.

The results of the five matches held over two days are as follows: Guangdong Team One defeated Hunan Team with a score of 11-8, while Guangdong Team Two lost to the Guangzhou Water Polo Team with a score of 10-13. Guangdong Team One also won against Guangdong Team Two with a score of 14-6. Sichuan Team defeated the Guangzhou Team with a score of 8-6, and the Guangxi Team tied with the Hunan Team at 5-5.
