Since the beginning of winter, approximately 4,000 swans have flown from Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, and the Soviet Union to Shandong's Rongcheng, specifically to the Mashan Port. The climate here is mild, with numerous lakes and an abundance of fish and shrimp, making it an ideal place for migratory birds to spend the winter. The swans pair up, pecking at each other and playing, adding a poetic charm to the tranquil lakes. Mashan Port has thus earned the name "Swan Lake."

    “天鹅湖”
    入冬以来，约有4000只天鹅由新疆、内蒙古和苏联飞到山东荣城马山港。这里气候温和，湖泊连绵，鱼虾丰富，适宜候鸟过冬，它们成双成对，相互啄食嬉戏，为恬静的湖泊增添了诗情画意，马山港赢得了天鹅湖的美称。　邓佳摄
