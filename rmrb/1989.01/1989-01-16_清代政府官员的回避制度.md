The deterioration of officialdom can be said to be a chronic and deep-seated problem of feudal politics, an incurable disease. This is not to say that any feudal ruler, in their subjective intentions, approved or encouraged political corruption. In fact, many of the highest rulers of feudal dynasties, starting from the long-term stability of feudal rule, made various efforts to ensure the normal operation of the state machinery, and these efforts often had a certain effect for a time. However, such efforts ultimately could not overcome the various inherent contradictions brought about by the essential characteristics of feudal politics.

The last feudal dynasty in Chinese history, the Qing Dynasty, established a meticulous and strict system of back-aways for government officials, which played an active role in curbing the deterioration of officialdom during a certain historical period.

Soon after the Qing Dynasty established a national government, certain flaws in the bureaucratic system began to emerge. In an edict from the ninth year of the Shunzhi reign (1652), it was stated: "The personnel department is responsible for selecting officials. It is said that there are those who use personal connections or accept bribes for personal gain. This trend must be stopped." The system of back-aways for officials was precisely formulated to prevent and curb such phenomena and was gradually perfected during the reigns of Kangxi, Yongzheng, and Qianlong.

The system of back-aways for officials mainly included the following:

1. **Avoiding Home Province for Officials**: Officials serving outside the capital were not allowed to hold positions in their home provinces. According to the regulations, governors-general, governors, financial commissioners, and judicial commissioners were not allowed to appoint local officials from their own provinces to avoid interference and requests from relatives and neighbors. Even for officials from neighboring provinces, they had to be at least five hundred miles away from their home provinces. Prefects, vice-prefects, assistant prefects, and county magistrates could be transferred within the same province as long as their home provinces were not within their jurisdiction. Later, the scope of avoiding home provinces was further expanded. Not only the home province had to be avoided, but also the ancestral home (the ancestral home province) and the place of long-term residence (the place of long-term residence) had to be avoided. During the Guangxu reign, the Qing court appointed Liao Shoufang as the financial commissioner of Fujian. Liao was from Jiading, Jiangsu, and originally did not need to avoid serving in Fujian. However, his ancestors had lived in Yongding County, Fujian, making Fujian his ancestral home. Liao Shoufang immediately reported this situation, and as a result, the court changed his appointment to the financial commissioner of Henan. This shows that even in the late Qing Dynasty, this system of avoiding home provinces for officials was still strictly enforced.

Not only civil officials had to avoid their home provinces, but military officials also had to do so. In the twelfth year of the Qianlong reign (1747), it was decided that "regardless of whether they were in the navy or the army, deputy generals and assistant generals had to avoid serving in their home provinces; captains, battalion commanders, and garrison commanders could be appointed to positions five hundred miles away or in separate prefectures and camps. However, for lower-ranking officers such as company commanders, they had to be transferred to other provinces, which would cause difficulties, so they were allowed to remain in their home provinces and did not need to avoid serving there."

2. **Avoiding Relatives in the Same Office**: Relatives, especially direct relatives, were not allowed to serve in the same office in the capital or in the same region for officials serving outside the capital. According to the regulations, "officials in the capital," not only grandparents, parents, uncles, brothers, and sons were not allowed to work together, but even "relatives by marriage, such as the father and brothers of the mother, the father and brothers of the wife, the husbands of sisters, and the sons-in-law and grandsons of the official," had to "order the lower-ranking official to avoid serving, and order the later-appointed official to avoid serving in the same office." In the provinces, direct relatives "if they served in the same province, it was difficult to avoid the evils of favoritism and nepotism," and "it was easy to communicate and scheme, and the evils were even greater," so it was stipulated that "grandparents, parents, uncles, brothers, and cousins, from the level of prefectures and counties down to minor officials, regardless of rank, were not allowed to serve in the same province, to prevent evils."

In addition, the Qing Dynasty also had a strict system of avoiding relatives in the imperial examination system for selecting officials. During the Shunzhi reign, it was clearly stipulated that during the county and provincial examinations, the children, nephews, and grandsons of the chief examiner and the associate examiners were not allowed to enter the examination hall to take the exam. During the Yongzheng reign, it was once stipulated that those who needed to avoid relatives were examined separately in the Imperial Study or were given separate seat numbers in the examination hall and had different officials set the questions and correct the papers. After the ninth year of the Qianlong reign (1744), it was still prohibited for the children of the chief examiner and the associate examiners to participate in the examinations in their own regions to avoid favoritism and cheating.

3. **Prohibiting Officials from Forming Connections**: The Qing government paid great attention to preventing local officials from forming connections with imperial princes and high-ranking officials in the capital, especially strictly prohibiting officials from forming connections with imperial attendants and engaging in favoritism and cheating. To this end, the Qing government made many regulations. For example, an imperial edict from the thirty-fourth year of the Qianlong reign (1769) stated: "From now on, the subordinates of various princes are only allowed to visit the gates of the capital as before, but those who are currently serving as officials outside the capital and come to the capital for business are not allowed to visit the princes they are responsible for, to clean up the source of corruption." Officials serving outside the capital were not allowed to visit officials in the capital when leaving the capital to take up their posts; after taking up their posts, they were not allowed to send people to present local gifts and establish connections with officials in the capital, otherwise, they would be dismissed from their posts. Officials in the capital "who met with them or sent people to their posts" would also be dismissed. Officials were not allowed to form teacher-student relationships due to the imperial examination system, recommendations, etc., and were not allowed to "use teacher-student relationships as a means of advancing their careers." The prohibition on "officials from various departments and eunuchs and attendants forming connections" was even more severe. If it was found that there was "communication between the inside and outside, leaking information," or "favoritism and cheating," "all would be sentenced to beheading and exile, and their wives and children would be exiled three thousand miles away."

All these measures and methods, either because they were only aimed at certain local problems and could not fundamentally clean up the officialdom, or because they could not be implemented consistently and gradually became empty words, some even suffered from self-destruction by the highest feudal rulers. By the end of the Qing Dynasty, the deterioration of officialdom had become an irreversible trend. During the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom period, peasant leaders denounced the Qing Dynasty's rule as "officials obtaining their positions through bribery, criminals escaping punishment through money, the rich holding power, and heroes losing hope," and "allowing corrupt officials to be rampant throughout the country, stripping the people of their fat." During the Xinhai Revolution, leaders of the bourgeois revolutionary party exposed the Qing government's "political corruption, loss of order," "selling official positions, openly taking bribes," and "stripping the people of their wealth, more ferocious than tigers and wolves." It was precisely the political corruption that sent this feudal dynasty into the grave of history. As for the Qing Dynasty's system of back-aways for officials, whether in its successful aspects or in its failed aspects, it can provide us with some lessons.

　　清代政府官员的回避制度
    李文海　杨盖茂
    吏治败坏可以说是封建政治的痼疾宿弊，不治之症。这当然不是说任何一个封建统治者，在主观上都赞许甚至怂恿政治腐败现象。事实上，颇有一些封建王朝的最高统治者，从封建统治的长治久安出发，为保证国家机器的正常运转作出了种种努力，并且往往也确能奏效于一时，只是这种努力终究不能克服由封建政治的本质特性所带来的各种固有矛盾而已。
    中国历史上最后一个封建王朝清朝，曾经建立起一套周密严格的政府官员回避制度，在一定历史时期里起过抑制吏治败坏的积极作用。
    清王朝自从建立起全国性政权后不久，官僚制度中的某些弊端就开始显露出来。顺治九年（１６５２年）的一个谕旨称：“铨部职司用人，凡有铨选应用才能。今朕闻有援引亲党及纳贿营私者，此风断不可长。”官员回避制度正是为了防止和阻扼这种现象而制定，并经过康熙、雍正、乾隆三朝而逐步完善的。
    官员回避制度主要包括以下内容：
    一、外官避籍。即外任官员，不得在本籍任职。按规定，总督、巡抚、藩司、臬司等地方大吏，不得任用本省人士担任，以避免亲族邻里的干预请托。即使是邻省的，也必须距本籍五百里以外方可。知府、同知、通判、知州等官，只要原籍不在自己辖区之内，可以“于本省内调补”。后来，籍贯回避的范围又进一步扩大，不但本籍要回避，连祖籍（祖先的籍贯）、寄籍（长期寄居之地）也都要回避。光绪年间，清廷任命廖寿丰为福建布政使，廖是江苏嘉定人，本来无庸回避，但他的先世曾居福建永定县，福建是他的祖籍。廖寿丰立即申报了这一情况，结果朝廷便改授他为河南布政使。这说明，一直到晚清，这种外官避籍制度还在严格执行着。
    不但文职官员要“避籍”，武职也一样。乾隆十二年（１７４７年）定议，“副将、参将，无论水师陆路，均回避本省；游击、都司、守备准予五百里外及隔府别营题补。至千总末属微员，发往他省不免俯仰拮据之虑，仍留本省题补，不必回避”。
    二、同官避亲。即亲属特别是直系亲属，京官不得在同一衙门、外任官不得在同一地区任职。按规定，“在京堂司各官”，不但祖孙、父子、叔伯、兄弟不得共事，即使“外姻亲属中母之父兄弟、妻之父兄弟、姊妹之夫、己之女婿嫡甥同衙门”，也要“令官小者回避，同官令后进者回避”。在地方，直系亲属“若同在一省服官，难免瞻徇夤缘诸弊”，“声气易通，转辗营谋，其弊滋甚”，所以规定“祖孙父子胞伯叔兄弟自道府以至佐杂等官，无论官阶大小，概不准同官一省，以杜弊端”。
    此外，清代在选拔官员的科举考试中，也有严格的亲属回避制度。顺治年间曾明文规定，乡、会试时，主考官和同考官的子弟侄甥，一律不准入场应试。雍正时，曾一度将应回避之子弟等人单独试于内阁，或在闱中另编座号，别派大臣出题阅卷。乾隆九年（１７４４年）以后，仍禁止主考官和同考官的子弟在本地区参加科考，以避免营私舞弊。
    三、禁止内外官交结。清朝政府十分注意防范地方封疆大吏与朝廷王公大臣除公务往来以外的攀援勾结，尤其严厉禁止外官与皇室近侍之间互通声气，营私舞弊。为此，清政府作了许多规定，如乾隆三十四年（１７６９年）一个上谕说：“嗣后，各王公属下人等惟京员向各门往来仍照旧不禁外，其有现任外任职官因事来京者，概不许于本管王公处谒见通问，以清弊源。”外任官员离京赴任时，不得谒见京官；到任后更不得派人向京官呈送土仪礼品，拉拢关系，否则要予革职处分。京官“与之接见及差人至外官任所往来者，亦革职。”官员之间不得因科举阅卷、举荐等关系而“竞认师生”，更不准“籍师生关系为攀援上进之阶”。对“诸衙门官吏与内官及近侍人员互相交结”的禁令尤为严厉，若发现有“内外交通，泄漏事情”、“夤缘作弊”等，“皆斩监候，妻子流三千里安置”。
    所有这些办法和措施，或者因为只是针对某些局部问题，不可能起到从根本上澄清吏治的作用，或者因为不能贯彻始终，渐成具文，有的甚至遭到最高封建统治者的自我破坏。到了清朝末叶，吏治的败坏终于成了不可逆转的趋势。太平天国时期，农民领袖们指斥清王朝统治是“官以贿得，刑以钱免，富儿当权，豪杰绝望”，“又纵贪官污吏，布满天下，使剥民脂膏”；辛亥革命时期，资产阶级革命派领导人揭露清政府“政治不修，纲维败坏”，“鬻爵卖官，公行贿赂”，“剥民刮地，暴过虎狼”。正是政治的腐败，把这个封建王朝送进了历史的坟墓。就清代的官员回避制度来说，不论它的成功方面还是失败方面，都能够给我们一点借鉴。
