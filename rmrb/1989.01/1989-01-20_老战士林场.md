In the western mountainous region of Ningxiang County, Hunan, where the older generation of revolutionaries, including He Shuheng and Xie Juecheng, once carried out revolutionary activities, a group of retired cadres, with the aspirations of enriching the people and the country and planting trees for the people, began in 1984 to establish the "Old Soldiers Forest Farm" by bringing their own food and supplies.

The majority of the farm's owners are comrades who participated in the revolutionary struggle before liberation. Among the 38 cadres and workers, there are 20 people in their sixties and seventies. The main leader, Li Pinzhen, is 77 years old this year and served as the secretary of the Ningxiang County Committee of the Communist Party of China in 1938. Another leader, Jiang Yaxun, is also 76 years old and led the Ningxiang "Huang-Tang Uprising" in 1949, which shook the entire province.

Ningxiang is one of the 27 counties in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River with severe soil erosion. In 1962, Comrade Xie Juecheng wrote a letter to the Ministry of Forestry saying: "My hometown, Ningxiang, used to have many large trees... Now the entire county has only three large trees, and I am very sad. The big trees and clear springs have disappeared, leaving only the scenery in my heart." According to provincial and municipal investigations, the forest area decreased by 38.6% in 1980 compared to 1975. The area of soil erosion in the entire county increased from 401 square kilometers in 1958 to 1211 square kilometers in 1984, accounting for more than 1/4 of the total area of the county. The barren mountains in Huangcun and Xishan are particularly severe. In 1983, Li Pinzhen invited Jiang Yaxun, who joined the party in 1938 through his introduction, to obtain the support of the provincial and county party and government departments, and together they went to Huangcun District, Jingchong Township, Ningxiang, to set up camp and hang up the sign of the "Old Soldiers Forest Farm."

Li Pinzhen persuaded his relatives in Guangzhou to bring the old soldiers to dig holes in the cold, plant seedlings in the rainy season, and carry water to irrigate in the hot summer, spending three consecutive Spring Festivals with their comrades in the forest farm. Their actions moved many retired cadres, who brought their own food and supplies to join the battle. After nearly five years of hard work, they planted more than 450,000 trees and afforested more than 3,000 mu. The 3,800 fruit trees they planted yielded their first harvest last year; the first batch of Chinese firs planted in 1984 have grown to 4 meters tall. Last July and August, the local area had no rain for 50 days, and in previous years, this would have caused a drought disaster, but last year the springs in the mountains flowed continuously. On September 2, 1988, there was a heavy rain, which was rare in 20 years. In previous years, it would have caused a lot of soil erosion and flooded many fields, but last year there was very little soil erosion.

The local farmers did the math for them: in five years, the income from fruit trees and some fast-growing trees (such as paulownia) can reach more than 300 million yuan; in ten years, the income from timber forests and orchards can reach more than 3,000 million yuan. Of course, these old soldiers did not consider what they would get in five or ten years. They considered how to do more and better work for the people in their lifetime and months. In nearly five years, in addition to planting trees and afforesting, they also built a washing pier by the silk river according to the needs of the local people and dug a well with good water quality at the new bridgehead... They care about the interests of the people everywhere, but they themselves live a frugal life, with a monthly food allowance of 20 yuan per person. They grow vegetables and raise pigs themselves, often eating pumpkins, winter melons, green vegetables, and beans, with little tofu and even less meat. There is no television, no telephone, no means of transportation, and they live in dilapidated flat-roofed houses. Someone asked Li Pinzhen, "You are over 70 years old, why not enjoy the comfortable life of a bureau-level cadre in Guangzhou? Why come here to suffer?" Li Pinzhen said, "A person comes into the world and cannot just pass through it in vain. We enjoy retirement benefits, which is actually eating the people's food; eating the people's food, we must do things for the people, which is only natural."

　　“老战士林场”
    广东  于帆
    在湖南宁乡县的西部山区，老一辈革命家——何叔衡、谢觉哉等早年进行过革命活动的地方，一群离退休干部怀着富民富国、树木树人的宏愿，从１９８４年开始自带钱粮，办起了一个“老战士林场”。
    林场的主人绝大多数是解放前参加革命斗争的同志，３８名干部职工中，六七十岁的人有２０个。主要负责人李品珍，今年７７岁，１９３８年就曾担任中共宁乡县委书记；另一负责人姜亚勋，也已７６岁，１９４９年领导宁乡“黄·唐起义”，威震全省。
    宁乡是长江中下游２７个水土流失严重县之一。１９６２年，谢觉哉同志写信给林业部说：“我的家乡——宁乡，以前有不少大树……现全县只有三棵大树，我很伤心。大树清泉俱已杳，只留情景在心头。”根据省、市调查，仅１９８０年与１９７５年比较，森林面积就减少了３８．６％。全县水土流失面积由１９５８年的４０１平方公里扩大到１９８４年的１２１１平方公里，占全县总面积的１／４多。黄村、沩山雨区的荒山尤为严重。１９８３年，李品珍约了１９３８年经他介绍入党的姜亚勋，在取得省、县党政部门的支持后，一起来到宁乡黄村区井冲乡安营扎寨，挂起了“老战士林场”的招牌。
    李品珍说服了在广州的亲人，像当年打游击似的带领老战士在严寒中挖坑，在梅雨季节植苗，在酷暑中挑水浇灌，一连三个春节都和战友坚持住在林场。他们的行动感动了不少离退休干部，他们自带钱粮要求参战。经过近５年的艰苦奋斗，他们植树４５万多株，绿化面积３０００多亩。他们种的３８００株果树，去年收获了第一批果实；１９８４年第一批植的杉树已高达４米。去年７、８月间当地５０天没下雨，如在往年必定闹旱灾，去年山中的泉水却源源不断。去年９月２日下了一次大雨，为２０年所少见，如在往年不知要流失多少水土，淹没多少田地，但去年水土流失很少。
    当地农民给他们算了两笔账：５年后，单果树及部分速生树（如泡桐）的收入可达３００多万元；１０年后用材林与果园的收入可达３０００多万元。当然，这些老战士并没有考虑５年、１０年之后他们会得到什么，他们考虑的是如何在有生之年、之月，更多更好地为人民多做一点工作。将近５年中，他们除了植树造林外，还根据当地群众的需要在绢水边修建了洗衣码头，在新桥头开挖了一口优质水井……他们处处关心群众利益，而自己却过着清苦的生活，每月每人２０元钱伙食费。自己种菜、养猪，经常吃的是南瓜、冬瓜、青菜、豆类，豆腐不多，肉类更少。没有电视，没有电话，没有交通工具，住的是破平房。有人问李品珍：“你７０多岁了，不在广州享受厅级待遇的清福，为什么要到这里来吃苦？”李品珍说：“一个人来到人世，不能白白地空走一趟。我们享受离休待遇，实际是吃人民的饭；吃了人民的饭，便要为人民做事，这是天经地义的。”
