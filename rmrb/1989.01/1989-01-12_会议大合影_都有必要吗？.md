	Are Group Photos at Conferences Really Necessary?

	Chūnshēng

	It is unclear when exactly the trend of taking "group photos at conferences" began.

	For any significant conference, there is always this item on the agenda: a large number of attendees stand in dense rows, and a large rotating camera "scans" them. Afterwards, each person receives a long photograph, and everyone carefully searches for their own position. Then what? It is stored away in some cabinet, and that's the end of it. Some people have a pile of these photographs, but who cares about the cost!

	This is not the end of it. The author has consecutively attended several national conferences and has other observations: hundreds of representatives (mostly elders) stand shoulder to shoulder, forming a multi-tiered giant arc. However, often this arc has been "set" for a long time, and the seats in the front row, marked with the names of the leaders, remain empty.

	Hundreds of people stand together, unable to move forward, backward, left, or right. They are either baked by the sun or roasted by the lights, standing for dozens of minutes, feeling their legs shake. Once, an elderly person fainted on the fourth step, and if it weren't for the support of those around him, he would have fallen badly...

	Just how necessary is this group photo? Opinions vary. Some say: it has commemorative significance and is worth it. Others say: it's really not worth taking. How should we view it? Is there still some outdated thinking in people's minds? The author does not dare to make a hasty judgment. To say that we should cancel this item on the agenda, we might dampen the enthusiasm of those in the photo or affect the business of the photography studio.

### “会议大合影”都有必要吗？

　　“会议大合影”都有必要吗？
    春声
    不知自何日始，“会议大合影”风行起来。
    举凡大点的会，总有这样一个节目：众多与会者密密层层排开，由大型转动相机“扫描”一番。尔后，每人可得到一幅长长的照片，大家细细寻觅自己的所在。再尔后呢，藏之某橱，完事大吉了。有的人这种照片有一堆，至于这笔开销多大，谁去管它呢！
    这且不算，笔者接连参加了几个全国性的大会，还有另一些感触：数百名代表（多为长者）一个挨一个挤上层层台阶，拢成一个“多层次”的巨大弧形。然而，常常是这弧形早已“定型”多时，最前头那排贴着领导同志姓名的坐椅仍虚位以待。
    几百人站在一起，前后左右动弹不得，或太阳晒，或大灯烤，一站就是几十分钟，“两股战战”哪！一次，一老者竟在第四级台阶上当即昏倒，若不是前后左右“众志成城”，真得摔个好歹……
    这种大合影到底有多大必要？其说不一。或曰：有纪念意义，值得。或曰：实在没啥照头。到底应怎样看待它，是不是人们的观念上还有点那个？笔者实不好妄评。说免了这个节目吧，又怕扫了相中人的兴、误了照相馆的营生。
