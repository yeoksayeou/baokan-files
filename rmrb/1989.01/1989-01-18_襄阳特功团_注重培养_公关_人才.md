The "Xiangyang Special Merit Unit" of the Nanjing Military Region has organized production and management personnel to study "public relations," promoting the development of the unit's production and operations.

In recent years, this unit has seen a flourishing development in production and operations, with more than 20 types of products entering the market. To further expand operations and develop production, the unit began training production and operations personnel in public relations in the previous year.

Currently, six newly appointed business personnel and one deputy factory director in the unit's production and operations units were appointed after passing the "public relations" assessment. At the beginning of last year, several "public relations newcomers" took on the leadership responsibilities of the loader repair factory. They quickly established cooperative relationships with more than 10 factories in Xiamen, Qingdao, and other places. The factory's annual profit increased more than twofold compared to 1987.

　　“襄阳特功团”注重培养“公关”人才
    本报讯  南京军区“襄阳特功团”组织生产经营管理人员学习“公共关系学”，促进了部队生产经营的发展。
    近几年来，这个团生产经营蓬勃发展，先后有２０多种产品投入市场。为了进一步扩大经营、发展生产，这个部队从前年开始，对所属生产经营单位的负责人及业务人员进行公共关系学培训。
    现在这个部队所属生产经营单位新上任的６位业务人员和一位副厂长都是经“公关学”考核合格后才任命的。去年初，几位“公关新秀”挑起了装载机修配厂的领导重担后，很快与厦门、青岛等地１０多个厂家建立了协作关系，该厂年利润比１９８７年增加两倍多。
