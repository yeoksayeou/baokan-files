	Beneath the Tian Shan, there is a heart crushed by power. A famous "Red Brick King," a representative of the People's Congress of Hami City, was once forced to wander the world for slighting some powerful figures.

	On the morning of December 27, 1988, Li Jinchang, known as the "Brick King" in Xinjiang, held a press conference in Beijing to share his experiences during the reforms.

	In early 1985, Li Jinchang submitted a proposal to Chen Shi, then commander of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, suggesting that he could "use a piece of abandoned land in the farm to build a brick factory without a single cent from the state, guaranteeing an annual profit of 10,000 yuan for the state." After approval, and through a tender process organized by his unit, Hongxing Farm, he secured the opportunity to start his business. Breaking ground, starting construction, building kilns, and firing bricks... In just two and a half years, he produced 40 million red bricks, repaid 400,000 yuan in loans, contributed 150,000 yuan in taxes and profits to the state, and donated and sponsored over 20,000 yuan to society. He became the famous "Red Brick King" of Hami and was elected as a representative of the Hami City People's Congress.

	At the beginning of last year, Li Jinchang, who was then riding high, was diagnosed with an abdominal tumor. From then on, he seemed to have encountered a streak of bad luck. The torment from power and ideology was even more painful than the tumor. He finally gave in. He handed over all his fixed assets worth over 200,000 yuan to the state and, on May 4, 1988, moved to Changwu County, Shaanxi, with his wife and children.

	When he bid farewell to the Tian Shan, he shed tears. He loved the Tian Shan and was willing to shed blood for it; he also hoped that the Tian Shan would love him and help him realize his ambitions. He was confident: he had no ulterior motives and harbored no ill will towards anyone. However, some powerful figures who felt slighted believed that Li Jinchang had offended them!

	Before he started the brick factory, he had been in charge of the farm's construction team. During this time, he dismissed an incompetent accountant. This action sowed the seeds of trouble. The accountant's brother-in-law soon took over as the party secretary of Hongxing Farm, and from then on, Li Jinchang's troubles never ended. In 1985, after his idea to lease the wasteland to build a brick factory was approved, the secretary decided to hold a tender. He published Li Jinchang's feasibility study. Seeing his painstakingly prepared plan exposed, Li Jinchang endured the pain and raised the bid, securing the contract with an annual contribution of 20,000 yuan. Although he did not ask the state for a single cent for his brick factory and relied entirely on personal funds, he was forced to sign a contract stating that "all fixed assets of the brick factory would belong to the public after five years." The eager Li Jinchang did not anticipate that this contract would become a noose around his neck in the future.

	Li Jinchang prospered in his brick business, and his production was booming. In just over two years, his bricks made up more than 80% of the high-rise buildings in the Hami region. He himself became wealthy: he changed his clothes, renovated his house, and even bought a minivan. In a circle where the party secretary of the farm still rode a bicycle, this was too conspicuous. Soon, he received a court summons demanding repayment of alleged debts from his construction team several years ago. He argued his case, and two months later, he won. But the price he paid for dodging this "bullet" was that his factory's machines almost stopped running. Later, the road in front of the factory was dug up. His car was seized for reasons he found inexplicable. Then, his house was flooded, and his wife and daughter were beaten without cause. He wanted to sue, but he couldn't find the defendant; he wanted to seek help, but he could only turn to the secretary. However, the secretary ignored him.

	Once, the secretary wanted to buy 40,000 bricks from Li Jinchang to build a house for his father. The naive Li Jinchang made the secretary write a note, missing an opportunity to turn "cloudy to sunny." He still hasn't received the money for the 40,000 bricks, but various taxes and fees kept coming.

	Li Jinchang feared power because he couldn't do without its protection. After becoming a thorn in his superior's side, he often faced trouble even when he was at home. Walking on the street, strangers would ask him for money, and he dared not refuse; acquaintances would ask for cigarettes and alcohol, and he had to oblige. Someone needed money to get married and asked him for 6,000 yuan; someone couldn't repay a loan and asked him to cover it; even Hongxing Farm, when it had financial difficulties, borrowed 350,000 yuan from him. Li Jinchang had truly become a public bus, costing very little to ride for a long distance; he had become a communal pot, where one could just stick in a spoon and eat. When the news that he wanted to donate the brick factory to the state spread, someone even came to his door with a knife demanding money. Li Jinchang sought protection from the public security bureau, but the bureau chief said, "After you made money, you donated everywhere, but did you ever donate a single cent to our public security system? You donate to whoever, and let them protect you." The disappointed Li Jinchang was completely hopeless. Even the sofa, wardrobe, and desk in his home were taken by others. Finally, he had to hire a truck for 1,800 yuan, load it with four barrels of gasoline, and drive east with his wife and children. A representative of the People's Congress with a "Hami City People's Congress Inspection Certificate" thus quietly disappeared from Hami.

	However, many people did not treat Li Jinchang badly. At the end of May 1988, Guo Gang, political commissar of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, received Li Jinchang and affirmed his achievements. The disciplinary inspection commission of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps sent a working group to Hongxing Farm to solve the problems, and the party secretary of the farm had been disciplined. At the end of December 1988, Yang Zhi Yuan and Li Mingyu, deputy ministers of the State Building Materials Bureau, received Li Jinchang and praised his contributions to the building materials industry. The Hami Management Bureau of the Corps also decided to invite Li Jinchang back to do something.

　　天山下，有颗被权力碾伤的心
    有名的“红砖大王”，哈密市人大代表，因为怠慢了一些权势者，曾经漂泊天涯
    １９８８年１２月２７日上午，被新疆人称为“砖王”的李金昌在北京举行新闻发布会，介绍了他在改革中的遭遇。
    １９８５年初，李金昌上书当时的新疆生产建设兵团司令员陈实，提出“不要国家一分钱，利用农场一片荒废地办砖厂，保证每年给国家上交一万元利润”的申请，经批准，并通过他所在单位红星三场的招标，他获得了创业机会。破土、动工、建窑、烧砖……才两年半，他就烧出了４０００万块红砖，还清了４０多万元借款，给国家上交利税１５万多元，向社会捐助和赞助２万多元。他成了闻名哈密的“红砖大王”，被选为哈密市人大代表。
    去年初，春风得意的李金昌得了腹部肿瘤。从此，他仿佛交上了“华盖运”，来自权力和观念的轰击比肿瘤折磨还要痛苦。他终于屈服了。他将价值２０余万元的固定资产全部交给国家，于１９８８年５月４日携妻带子，来到陕西长武县栖身。
    告别天山时，他流泪了。他爱天山，愿意为它奉献热血；也希望天山爱他，帮助他一展宏图。他问心无愧：从无非分之想，从无伤人之心。然而，有些被怠慢了的权势者却认为李金昌得罪了他们！
    他在办砖厂之前，曾负责过农场建筑队的生产，在此期间，撤换了一个不称职的预算员。这种下了祸根。预算员的姐夫不久调来当红星三场的党委书记，从此，他的“小鞋”就穿不完了。１９８５年，他要承包荒地办砖厂的想法被批准后，书记却决定招标承包，并把李金昌可行性论证公布于众。看到自己辛辛苦苦制订出的计划被曝光，李金昌强忍痛苦，只好提高标的，以平均每年上交２万元夺标。尽管他办砖厂没要国家一分投资，全靠个人筹集，但也被迫与农场签定了“５年后砖厂全部固定资产归公”的合同。急于求成的李金昌没有料到这纸合同，成了日后书记扼制他的一条绳索。
    气气派派地烧砖，红红火火地生产。李金昌经营有方，生财有道，两年多，就使他的砖构成了哈密地区８０％以上的高层建筑。他自己也富起来了：换装，修房，还买了一辆面包型小汽车。在场党委书记还用自行车代步的圈子里，这太扎人眼了。很快，他收到了法院让他偿还几年前所谓建筑队欠款的传票。他据理力争，两个月后，他胜诉了。但他躲过这一“枪”的代价却是砖厂的机器几乎停转。后来，厂前的路被挖断了。车被扣留了，理由都是令他莫名其妙的。接着，他家的房子被淹，妻女无缘无故被追打。他欲告，找不到被告；欲求，只能求书记。可是，书记却不理不睬。
    有一次，书记要买李金昌４万块砖给父亲修房，“不谙世事”的李金昌却让书记打了条子，失去一个“多云转晴”的机会。４万块砖的钱，他至今也没有收到，但苛捐杂税却接踵而来。
    李金昌这样的人怕权，是因为离不开权的保护。他成了顶头上司的“眼中钉”之后，常常人在家中坐，祸从天上来。走在街上，素不相识的人向他借钱，他不敢不掏腰包；情分不深的人向他要烟要酒，他不得不“敬烟敬酒”。讨媳妇缺钱，求他援助６０００元的人有之；贷款到期无力偿还，请他垫支的人有之；就连红星三场资金周转不开时，也向他借去３．５万元。李金昌真成了一辆公共汽车，花很少的钱，便可长途乘坐；真成了大锅饭，伸勺就可盛着吃。当他要把砖厂捐献给国家的消息传出后，有人竟拿刀子上门要钱。李金昌寻求公安局的保护，公安局长却说：“你发财后，到处捐款，对我们公安系统你给过一分钱的赞助没有？你给谁捐款，就让谁保护你。”失望的李金昌完全绝望了。就连他家中的沙发、大衣柜、写字台等家什也被别人要的要，拿的拿。最后他只得用１８００元钱雇了辆大卡车，装上四桶汽油，拉着妻儿，向东走去。一个装有“哈密市人大代表视察证”证件的人大代表就这样在哈密悄然消失了。
    然而许许多多的人待李金昌并不薄。１９８８年５月底，新疆兵团政委郭刚接待了李金昌，肯定了他的成绩，新疆兵团纪委派工作组到红星三场解决问题，场党委书记已受到党纪处分。１９８８年１２月底，国家建材局副局长杨志元、李明豫接待了李金昌，赞扬了他对建材工业的贡献。兵团哈密管理局也决定请李金昌回去干一番事业。
