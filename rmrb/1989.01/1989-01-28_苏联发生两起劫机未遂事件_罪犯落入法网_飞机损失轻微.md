Two hijacking attempts were foiled in the Soviet Union, with the culprits apprehended and the aircraft sustaining only minor damage.

MOSCOW, Jan. 26 (Xinhua) — According to today's report by *Izvestia*, two hijacking attempts occurred in the Soviet Union on January 20th and 21st, both of which were unsuccessful, and the perpetrators were captured.

On January 20th, a Tu-134 aircraft carrying 72 passengers on the Arkhangelsk-Kiev-Odessa route was flying over the Black Sea when a passenger in the rear of the plane demanded through a flight attendant that the crew change course to Bucharest or Israel, threatening to blow up the aircraft if his demands were not met. The crew agreed to his request but explained that they needed to refuel in Odessa first. After landing, two police officers negotiated with the hijacker. It was decided that one police officer would act as a hostage while the other passengers were released. Two hours later, the hijacker was apprehended. It was later discovered that the hijacker, named Kotyuba, was a mental patient residing in the Sumy region.

On January 21st, an An-24 aircraft on the Ivano-Frankivsk-Kiev route, carrying 48 passengers, was nearly hijacked. As the plane began to taxi on the runway, a passenger went to the rear of the aircraft and started a fire, demanding that the plane change course to a foreign country. The plane immediately stopped, and with the joint efforts of the flight attendants, crew members, and a pilot, the hijacker was subdued and the fire extinguished. Two passengers and one pilot sustained minor burns. The hijacker, Zemskov, was 34 years old.

According to the Russian Federation's legal code, hijackers face 3 to 15 years in prison, with more severe sentences, including the death penalty, for those causing injury or death.

　　苏联发生两起劫机未遂事件    
    罪犯落入法网　飞机损失轻微
    新华社莫斯科１月２６日电  据《消息报》今天报道，１月２０日和２１日苏联接连发生两起劫机未遂事件，罪犯均被抓获。
    １月２０日，在阿尔汉格尔斯克—基辅—敖德萨航线上，一架载有７２名乘客的“图—１３４”式客机在黑海上空飞行时，飞机后排有一人通过航空小姐要求机组改飞布加勒斯特或以色列，否则他将炸毁飞机。机组答应满足他的要求，但说明必须先在敖德萨加油。飞机着陆后，来了两位民警与劫机犯谈判，最后决定由一名民警作人质，把乘客全部放走。２小时后，罪犯落入法网。事后得知，劫机者名叫科秋巴，是精神病患者，家住苏梅州。
    １月２１日，飞伊万诺—弗兰科夫斯克—基辅航线的一架“安—２４”式客机也险些被劫持。这架载客４８人的飞机刚开始在跑道上滑行，就有一名乘客走到飞机尾部点起一把火，要飞机改飞国外。飞机立即停止滑行，在航空小姐、乘员及一名飞行员的共同努力下，制服劫机犯，扑灭火。两名乘客和一名飞行员轻度烧伤。劫机者叫泽姆斯科夫，３４岁。
    俄罗斯联邦法典规定，劫机者要判３至１５年徒刑，造成人员伤亡的要重判，直至死刑。
