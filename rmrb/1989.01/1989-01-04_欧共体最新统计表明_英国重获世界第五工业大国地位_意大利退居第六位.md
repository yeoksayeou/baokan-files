According to calculations by the European Community's statistical bureau, in 1986, Britain's gross domestic product was 803.7 billion standard purchasing power units, while Italy's was 803.6 billion standard purchasing power units. Therefore, Britain has regained its position as the world's fifth largest industrial power, while Italy has dropped to sixth place.

In 1986, Italy had increased its economic statistics by 17.8% to account for its underground economy, which allowed Italy to surpass Britain and become the world's fifth largest industrial power in 1985. However, this position was only maintained for one year.

In 1987, Britain's gross domestic product grew by 3.8%, while Italy's grew by only 3.6%, widening the gap. In 1988, Italy's gross domestic product grew by approximately 3.5%, slightly higher than Britain's, but not enough to close the gap.

According to the Evening Post, Britain's position as the fifth largest industrial power is well-deserved: in 1986, the total industrial production index for Italy was 11 points lower than Britain's; Britain had 22.137 million telephones, while Italy had only 18.253 million; Britain's exports were 40 billion standard purchasing power units higher than Italy's; Britain's per capita gross domestic product was 14,158 standard purchasing power units, while Italy's was 14,037. In terms of cultural consumption, education, public services, and other aspects, Italy also falls short of Britain.

　　欧共体最新统计表明
    英国重获世界第五工业大国地位
    意大利退居第六位
    本报罗马１月３日电  记者罗晋标报道：据欧共体统计局的计算，１９８６年英国国内生产总值为８０３７亿标准购买力单位，意大利为８０３６亿标准购买力单位，因此英国重新获得世界第５工业大国的地位，意大利退居第６位。
    １９８６年，意大利曾把其经济统计数字调高１７．８％，作为对其地下经济的估算，因而使意大利在１９８５年超过英国而成为世界第５工业大国，但仅仅维持了一年。
    １９８７年英国国内生产总值增长３．８％，意大利只有３．６％，这就使距离又拉大了。１９８８年意大利国内生产总值增长３．５％左右，比英国稍高，但不足以弥补已经拉开的距离。
    据《晚邮报》认为，英国居第５工业大国地位理所当然：１９８６年工业生产总指数意大利比英国相差１１点；英国有电话２２１３．７万部，意大利只有１８２５．３万部；出口英国比意大利多４００亿标准购买力单位；人均国内生产总值英国为１４１５８标准购买力单位，意大利为１４０３７标准购买力单位。在文化消费、教育、公共服务等方面意大利也不及英国。
