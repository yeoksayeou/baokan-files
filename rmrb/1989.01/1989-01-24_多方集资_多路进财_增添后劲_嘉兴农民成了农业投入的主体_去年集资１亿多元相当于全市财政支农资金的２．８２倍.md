Over the past few years, the Jiaxing Municipal Party Committee and government have adhered to the principle of "relying on the entire society to mobilize resources from multiple sources, increase agricultural investment, and enhance agricultural productivity." They have made farmers and rural collectives the mainstay of agricultural investment.

Currently, Jiaxing has established four accumulation systems: the Agricultural Development Fund, the Cooperative Fund, the Contractual Accumulation System, and the Farmers' Labor Accumulation System. These systems have formed a new mechanism for regulating agricultural investment and accumulation with farmers as the main body. Last year, the city raised over 100 million yuan through these means, equivalent to 2.82 times the municipal fiscal support for agriculture.

The establishment of the Agricultural Development Fund in Jiaxing began in 1986. Over the past two years, it has undergone a process from supplementing agriculture with industrial profits to establishing a development fund system, from township and village-level fundraising to three-level fundraising at the county, township, and village levels, and from fundraising solely from township enterprises to fundraising from the entire society.

The channels for raising the Agricultural Development Fund at the county, township, and village levels in Jiaxing are roughly as follows:

- **Township Enterprise Fundraising**: This includes the full amount of increased taxable wages, a portion of the enterprise's total profit before tax (10%), and a portion of the profit after tax.

- **State and Local Government Fundraising**: This includes special funds allocated by higher authorities for agricultural development, agricultural investment included in the county budget, a portion of the increase in local retained revenue from the state's collection of township enterprise income tax and business tax, retained land development fees and land occupation tax, retained pig stabilization funds, and surplus funds from the internal price difference of grain procurement tasks.

- **Urban Enterprise and Related Department Fundraising**: This includes enterprises that employ rural labor, such as state-owned, light industry, and large collective enterprises, which contribute to the Agricultural Development Fund based on the number of rural workers and a monthly standard of 3-5 yuan per person. Departments such as grain, supply and marketing, foreign trade, food, and silk, which operate agricultural and sideline products and their processed products, ensure the completion of national tax collection and contribute a certain proportion of their operating profits to the Agricultural Development Fund each year.

- **Farmer Fundraising**: This includes individual and household businesses, transportation households, and "five craftsmen" in rural areas, each contributing a monthly agricultural subsidy; household and joint household enterprises contributing agricultural subsidies based on the number of people; economic benefits from operating perennial economic crops and pond fish farming, which are contributed to the collective; compensation fees for abandoned and fallow land; contract breach compensation; and substitute funds for failure to provide labor accumulation as required.

To manage and utilize the Agricultural Development Fund effectively, Jiaxing has focused on three key areas:

1. **Emphasizing Priorities**: The Agricultural Development Fund is primarily used for agricultural infrastructure, introducing and developing new varieties, technologies, and products; supporting economically weak villages to develop village-level economies; supporting projects that provide services to agriculture; and assisting large-scale operations in grain production and pig farming. The focus is on supporting agricultural expansion and reproduction, rather than maintaining simple reproduction. Last year, 112 million yuan was used for agricultural water conservancy projects at the township and village levels, accounting for more than half of the total investment.

2. **Combining Three Aspects**: This includes combining paid use with unpaid support, with a focus on paid use; combining agricultural subsidies with agricultural development, with a focus on development; and combining annual use with gradual accumulation, with a focus on annual use. Haiyan County last year lent out 8.55 million yuan in Agricultural Development Funds for paid use, accounting for 28.4% of the total funds raised at the county level, supporting the construction of commercial bases for pigs, aquaculture, fruits, and vegetables.

3. **Strengthening Fund Management**: Jiaxing has established management organizations and systems for the fund at all levels. The fund is collected and used at different levels, stored in designated accounts, and used for specific purposes.

　　多方集资　多路进财　增添后劲    
    嘉兴农民成了农业投入的主体     
    去年集资１亿多元相当于全市财政支农资金的２．８２倍
    本报讯  新华社记者虞云达报道：近几年来，浙江嘉兴市委、市政府坚持“依靠全社会多方集资，多路进财，增加农业投入，增添农业后劲”的原则，把乡村集体和农民群众作为农业投入的主体。
    目前嘉兴市已经建立起农业发展基金制度、合作基金会制度、承包上交积累制度和农民劳动积累工制度等４项积累制度，从而形成了以农民为主体的农业投资积累调节新机制。去年全市由此共筹集资金１亿多元，相当于全市财政支农资金的２．８２倍。
    嘉兴市建立农业发展基金起自１９８６年，两年多来，经历了一个从以工补农到建立发展基金制度，从乡、村两级筹建到县、乡、村三级共建，从只向乡镇企业集资到向全社会集资的过程。
    嘉兴市县、乡、村三级农业发展基金的筹集渠道，大致有４条：
    ——乡镇企业集资部分，包括：计税工资提高部分全额列入；按企业实现利润总额１０％在税前列支的社会性开支和企业税后上交的利润中，各提取一定的比例。
    ——国家和地方财力集资部分，包括：上级下拨支持农业发展的专项资金；列入县财政预算的农业投资；国家从征收乡镇企业所得税和工商税每年增长的地方留存中，提取一定的比例，造地费和耕地占用税的留存部分；生猪稳定基金的留存部分；粮食定购任务中内扣差价的结余部分。
    ——城镇企业及有关部门集资部分，包括：使用农民工的国营、二轻、大集体企业、按农民工人数和每人每月３—５元的标准列入企业成本作为农业发展基金；粮食、供销、外贸、食品、丝绸等经营农副产品及其加工品的部门，从扶持生产出发，确保完成国家税收的前提下，每年从经营的利润中返回一定比例作为农业发展基金。
    ——农民集资部分，包括：农村个体工商户，运输户及“五匠”，每人每月缴纳的贴农金；户办、联户办企业按人数缴纳的贴农金；经营多年生经济作物、内塘养鱼取得经济效益后，上交集体的贴粮金；无故弃耕抛荒粮田，应向集体缴纳的资源补偿费；无故不履行合同应向集体缴纳的违约金；不能按规定提供劳动积累的代金等。
    为了管好用好农业发展基金，嘉兴市具体抓了三方面的工作：
    一是突出重点，把农业发展基金设的专项资金，使用主要用于农田基本建设；引进和开发新品种、新技术、新产品；扶持经济薄弱的村发展村级经济；支持发展为农业提供服务的项目；扶持种粮、养猪等专业生产大户发展规模经营。重点是支持农业扩大再生产，而不是为维持简单再生产。去年，嘉兴市乡村两级用于农田水利建设的有１１２０万元，占投放的总额一半多。
    二是坚持三个结合，即有偿使用与无偿扶持相结合，以有偿使用为主；补农与建农相结合，以建农为主；当年使用与逐年适当积累相结合，以当年使用为主。海盐县去年借出有偿使用的农业发展基金８５．５万元，占县级已筹基金总额的２８．４％，支持生猪、水产、水果、蔬菜等商品基地建设。
    三是加强基金管理。嘉兴市各地各级都普遍健全了对基金管理组织和管理制度。实行分级筹集、分级使用、专户存储、专款专用。（新华社供本报专稿）
