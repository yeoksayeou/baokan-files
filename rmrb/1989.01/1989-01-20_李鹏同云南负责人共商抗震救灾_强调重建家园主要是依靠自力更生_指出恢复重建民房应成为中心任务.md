Li Peng Discusses Earthquake Relief with Yunnan Officials

Emphasizes Self-Reliance in Rebuilding Homes

Points Out that Reconstructing Residential Buildings Should Be the Central Task

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, January 19 — (Reporters Wang Qinghai, Xu Zugen) Premier Li Peng said on January 18 in Kunming that the earthquake relief efforts in Yunnan should adhere to the principle of self-reliance, hard work, production development, and rebuilding homes.

After inspecting the earthquake-stricken areas in Yunnan, Li Peng discussed with the leaders of the Yunnan Provincial Party Committee and the provincial government how to further improve earthquake relief work. After hearing reports from the leaders of Yunnan Province and speeches from the heads of the State Planning Commission, the Ministry of Civil Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, and other departments, Li Peng said that rebuilding homes in the earthquake-stricken areas of Yunnan should rely on the strength of the local people, the strength of local governments at all levels, and the strength of the country, but more importantly, it should rely on the strength of the people to rebuild their homes on the basis of developing production.

Li Peng pointed out that this earthquake destroyed more than half of the residential buildings, and the recovery and reconstruction of residential buildings should become the center of the relief work. The reconstructed residential buildings should not only meet seismic requirements but also meet the living habits of the people. As much as possible, local resources and usable materials from collapsed houses should be utilized. In village and town construction, based on their financial and material conditions, they should handle the relationship between recovery and development, plan comprehensively, implement in stages, and strive to basically recover within three years without pursuing high standards. Priority should be given to the recovery and reconstruction of schools, hospitals, commercial outlets, and other facilities closely related to people's lives. Water facilities that have been damaged should be repaired as soon as possible to ensure safety during the rainy season. Government offices at all levels should make do with what they have and work in earthquake shelters, preparing to endure for two to three years. In the future, recovery and reconstruction should not build grand buildings and pursue high standards.

Regarding relief funds, Li Peng said that this earthquake caused significant losses and indeed requires funds. The general principle is that the people should save themselves, the local government should contribute, and the country has the responsibility to provide support. Even if the finances are difficult, money must be allocated to support Yunnan's relief work.

After discussing the situation of his visit to the earthquake-stricken areas, Li Peng said with satisfaction that the overall impression is that the earthquake relief work has been done well. Hundreds of thousands of disaster victims have food, clothing, and shelter, injured patients have received treatment, the spread of epidemics has been controlled, social order is stable, prices are relatively stable, the market is very prosperous, and the people's morale is good. This shows that the Yunnan Provincial Party Committee and the provincial government have organized the earthquake relief work effectively, and the Central Committee and the State Council give full affirmation. He also specially praised the People's Liberation Army and the People's Armed Police for playing a key role in earthquake rescue and relief.

Li Peng urged the leaders at all levels in Yunnan to fully recognize the importance of developing agricultural and grain production. He said that Yunnan's grain supply is not abundant, and it is necessary to take developing agriculture as a major issue and give full effort to it, striving for a good harvest in the first year after the disaster.

　　李鹏同云南负责人共商抗震救灾
    强调重建家园主要是依靠自力更生
    指出恢复重建民房应成为中心任务
    新华社昆明１月１９日电  （记者王青海、徐祖根）国务院总理李鹏１月１８日在昆明说，云南地震灾区抗震救灾要坚持自力更生，艰苦奋斗，发展生产，重建家园的方针。
    李鹏考察了云南地震灾区后，与云南省委、省政府负责同志共同研究了如何进一步做好抗震救灾工作。他在听取了云南省领导同志的汇报和国家计委、民政部、财政部等单位负责人的发言后说，云南地震灾区重建家园，要靠当地人民的力量，要靠地方各级政府的力量，也要靠国家的力量，但更多的是要靠人民的力量，在发展生产的基础上重建家园。
    李鹏指出，这次地震民房毁坏占受损建筑物的一半以上，恢复重建民房应成为救灾工作的中心。恢复重建的民房，既要符合抗震要求，又要符合群众的生活习惯。要尽可能利用当地资源和倒塌房屋的可用材料。在村镇建设上，根据自己的财力、物力情况，要处理好恢复与发展的关系，全面规划，分步实施，争取３年内基本恢复，不要追求高标准。要优先恢复和重建学校、医院、商业网点等与群众生活密切相关的设施。要尽快修复遭受破坏的水利设施，确保安全度过雨季。各级政府办公设施，要因陋就简，在地震棚内办公，准备苦上两三年。以后恢复重建，也不能搞楼堂馆所，追求高标准。
    关于救灾费用，李鹏说，这次地震，损失很大，的确需要资金。总的原则是群众自救一部分，地方政府出一部分，国家责无旁贷，财政再困难也要拿出钱来支持云南的救灾工作。
    李鹏谈到这次到地震灾区考察的情况后，满意地说，总的印象是，抗震救灾工作做得好，几十万灾民有吃有穿有住，伤病员得到治疗，控制了疫病的发生，社会秩序安定，物价相对稳定，市场也很繁荣，群众精神面貌很好，这说明云南省委、省政府组织抗震救灾是得力的，中央和国务院予以充分肯定。他还特别称赞了人民解放军和武警部队在抗震抢险过程中起了突击作用。
    李鹏提请云南各级领导干部充分注意发展农业生产和粮食生产的重大意义。他说，云南粮食不宽裕，一定要把发展农业作为大问题，全力抓好，要力争大灾后的第一年有个好收成。
