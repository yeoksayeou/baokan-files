The Inside Story of Sino-French Diplomatic Relations

In 1958, France established the Fifth Republic, and General Charles de Gaulle returned to power. In February 1962, France and Algeria signed the Évian Accords, ending the Algerian War. This removed one obstacle to the development of Sino-French relations.

In October 1963, General de Gaulle authorized former French Prime Minister Georges Bidault to bring a personal letter to China to discuss bilateral relations with Chinese leaders. Premier Zhou Enlai and Foreign Minister Chen Yi held talks with Bidault. Bidault said: General de Gaulle believed that it was abnormal for the leaders of two great powers like China and France not to hold talks; France initially did not recognize the People's Republic of China and maintained relations with Chiang Kai-shek, which created many problems; now, if China is willing to negotiate the establishment of diplomatic relations, France will make an independent decision regardless of the opinions of other countries. Premier Zhou responded: In recent years, since General de Gaulle took power, he has taken bold steps to maintain national independence and sovereignty, which some major powers may not like, but we think a country should do so; on the other hand, France's long-standing Algerian problem has been resolved according to the will of the Algerian people for self-determination, and France has recognized Algeria's independence, which is a good thing. Premier Zhou also pointed out: France did not sign the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, and China also opposes this treaty; without prior consultation, both sides have taken similar actions because both China and France want to maintain their independence and sovereignty and do not wish to be interfered with or invaded by any foreign country; we both advocate maintaining world peace internationally, not allowing a few major powers to monopolize international affairs, and only when all countries in the world achieve equal status and everyone has the right to be involved in world affairs can world peace be truly maintained. Premier Zhou emphasized the common ground between China and France, believing that the timing for the establishment of diplomatic relations was ripe. Bidault agreed with this view.

On the specific approach to establishing diplomatic relations, Bidault proposed: France is prepared to recognize the People's Republic of China and acknowledge that there is only one China, but hopes that China will not insist on France first breaking off relations with Taiwan. In response, Premier Zhou said: Regarding the Taiwan issue, there are two scenarios: one is to consider "the status of Taiwan is undetermined," which is not a small matter and would lead to the path of "two Chinas"; the other scenario is to treat it as a complex issue, where the Chiang Kai-shek clique and France have established diplomatic missions, and to get rid of such a relationship, some procedures are needed, which is not a big problem. Bidault confirmed that France's issue falls into the latter category.

Considering the importance of Sino-French diplomatic relations for developing China's relations with Western European countries, China, while insisting on the principle of opposing "two Chinas," adopted a flexible attitude towards the specific steps of establishing diplomatic relations. In the context of both sides reaching a tacit understanding that France recognizes the Government of the People's Republic of China as the sole legal government of China, China agreed to France's proposal for France and China to first announce the establishment of diplomatic relations, leading to France breaking off relations with Taiwan.

Subsequently, through negotiations between representatives of both countries in Switzerland on the specific details of establishing diplomatic relations, the two countries finally issued a joint communiqué on January 27, 1964, announcing the establishment of diplomatic relations and the appointment of ambassadors within three months. In this situation, the authorities in Taiwan withdrew their "embassy" from France, and then the Chinese Chargé d'Affaires arrived in Paris. France became the first Western major power to establish formal diplomatic relations with China. This was a major breakthrough for China in strengthening its relations with Western Europe.

### 中法建交内情

　　中法建交内情
    １９５８年，法国成立第五共和国，戴高乐将军重新执政。１９６２年２月，法国同阿尔及利亚签署了《埃维昂协议》，结束了阿尔及利亚战争，这为中法关系的发展扫除了一个障碍。
    １９６３年１０月，戴高乐将军授权法国前总理富尔携带他的一封亲笔信前来中国，代表他同中国领导人商谈两国关系问题。周恩来总理和陈毅外长同富尔先生进行了会谈。富尔说：戴高乐将军认为像中法这样两个大国的领导人现在还不能进行会谈是不正常的：法国一开始没有承认中华人民共和国，保持同蒋介石的关系，因而产生了很多问题；现在如果中国愿意同法国谈判建交，法国将不管别的国家的意见，独立自主地作出决定。周总理则表示：这几年来，戴高乐将军当政，在维护国家独立和主权方面采取了勇敢的步骤，有些大国可能不高兴，而我们觉得一个国家应该如此；另一方面，法国多年来没有解决的阿尔及利亚问题，已经根据阿尔及利亚民族自决的意志得到解决，法国承认阿尔及利亚的独立，这是件好事。周总理还指出：法国没有在部分禁止核武器试验条约上签字，中国也反对这个条约；双方事先并未交换过意见，但表现出来的行动却是一样的，因为中法两国都要维护自己的独立和主权，不愿受任何外国的干涉和侵犯；我们都赞成在国际上应该维护世界和平，不允许几个大国垄断国际事务，只有世界所有国家取得平等地位，大家都有权过问世界事务，才能真正维护世界和平。周总理强调了中法之间的共同点，认为两国建交的时机已经成熟。富尔先生同意这一看法。
    在建交的具体做法上，富尔提出：法国准备承认中华人民共和国，承认只有一个中国，但希望中国不要坚持法国先主动同台湾断交。对此，周总理答复说，关于台湾问题，有两种情况：一种是认为“台湾地位未定”，这就不是一个小问题，那会引导到“两个中国”的道路上去；另一种情况是作为一个复杂问题，蒋介石集团和法国互设有使领馆，为了摆脱这样一种关系，需要通过一些手续，这不是个大问题。富尔肯定法国的问题属于后者。
    考虑到中法建交对发展中国同西欧国家的关系有重要意义，中国在坚持反对“两个中国”的原则立场的同时，对建交的具体步骤采取灵活态度，在中法双方就法国承认中华人民共和国政府是中国的唯一合法政府达成默契的情况下，同意法国提出的中法先宣布建交从而导致法国同台湾断交的方案。
    此后，经过双方代表在瑞士就建交的具体事宜进行谈判，两国终于在１９６４年１月２７日发表联合公报，宣布建立外交关系，在３个月内任命大使。在这种情况下，台湾当局撤走了它驻法国的“大使馆”，然后中国驻法国使馆的临时代办到了巴黎。法国成为西方大国中第一个同中国建立正式外交关系的国家。这对于中国加强同西欧的关系是一个重大的突破。
