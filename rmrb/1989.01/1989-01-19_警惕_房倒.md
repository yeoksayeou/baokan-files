Beware of "House Flipping"
Jǐ Jiànmín

The "flippers" have a thousand tricks and endless variations, their "cunning" is immense. A poem praises them: "If you don't investigate, they'll flip; if you investigate, they'll run away; investigate here, they'll flip there; when they have a chance, they'll make a profit." Upon careful thought, one realizes it is not wrong.

Recently, when investigating "flippers," the focus was mainly on companies, home appliances, "three materials," coal, and other scarce commodities, but often overlooked the investigation of people's most basic and essential housing needs. Currently, "house flipping" is just beginning, and if not promptly banned, it will surely become more rampant.

Just look, as soon as the state begins to trial the commercialization of urban housing, some more cunning "flippers" see an opportunity and start engaging in "house flipping."

Some people, relying on their power, mark out a piece of land in the city center or suburbs, then use their authority and "network" to obtain building materials at low or no cost, and have construction teams within their influence build and renovate. Roughly spending a few meals' worth of money, a new house with its own courtyard and gate is quickly built. They already live in public housing, so the new house is not needed. After a few months, they sell it, earning tens of thousands of yuan. Doing this repeatedly, the money rolls in like a snowball. This is "official house flipping."

Some people currently live in quite decent public housing, originally wanting to privatize it but lacking the opportunity. Upon hearing about "housing commercialization," a few of them (naturally, they are leaders and still in office) discuss it, symbolically pay a small amount of money, and the public housing is renamed as private property, recorded in their personal names. After a year or two, they sell it, isn't this "an endless stream of wealth"? Doing this repeatedly, house prices soar, while those in urgent need of housing cannot afford it, and a few who are not short of housing make a lot of money. Truly, it harms the state, harms the people, and enriches the "house flippers."

"House flippers" have "economic acumen," they study policies thoroughly, choose the "loopholes" accurately, and collude with both internal and external parties. Their flipping methods are very concealed, always under the guise of official and legitimate banners. To catch them red-handed, one must be vigilant. However, since they want to flip, they will inevitably reveal their "fox tails." The various examples listed above are already hated by the people.

The reform of housing commercialization has been less than a year, and "house flippers" have already made some "achievements." If not promptly rectified, these pests will destroy the edifice of reform. Therefore, the author would like to remind: when investigating "flippers," do not let "house flippers" slip through the net.

### 警惕“房倒”

　　警惕“房倒”
    姬建民
    “倒儿”们千般手段，万般变化，“道行”很大。有诗赞曰：“不查他就倒，一查他就跑；查这他倒那，得空弄个饱。”一经细想，方知不谬。
    前段查“倒”，多是注意查公司，查家电、查“三材”、查煤炭等一些紧俏商品物资，却多忽略了查查人们生活最基本、最必需的住房，眼下，“房倒”正起于青萍之末，如不及时查禁，怕是越倒越凶哩。
    这不，国家刚开始试行城镇住房商品化，有些技高一筹的“倒儿”们便以为有空子可钻，转而干起“倒房”的营生。
    有的人凭借手中的权力，在闹市或市郊划出一块地皮，然后施展权力，动用“关系网”低价或免费倒来建筑材料，再让权力所及的建筑队营建装修，约略花上几顿饭钱，一座独院独门的新房也便霍然而立了。自己住着公房，新房原本是用不着的，置上几月，再转手一卖，三五万元便可入账，如是再三，“滚雪球”般地倒腾几次，腰包自然浑圆了。这是“官房倒”。
    有人现时住着一套相当不错的公房，原想化公为私正愁没有机会，一听“住房商品化”，哥儿几个（当然是领导而且在职）一嘀咕，象征性地交点小钱，公房也便改名姓私，记在个人名下。一年半载后，转手一卖，岂非“不尽财源滚滚来”了吗！如是，倒来倒去，房价倍增，而急需住房的人买不起，少数不缺房的人大把赚钱，真个是坑了国家，害了群众，肥了“房倒”。
    “房倒”多有“经济头脑”，政策研究得很透，“缺口”选得准，且上下串通，内外勾联，倒的手段又很隐蔽，且总是打着官冕堂皇的旗号，要抓住其把柄确需留心。然而既要倒，就总会露出“狐狸尾巴”。以上列举之种种，即已为群众所切齿痛恨。
    实行住房商品化的改革，刚刚不到一年，“房倒”已经有所“作为”，如不加紧治理，这些蛀虫将会毁坏改革的大厦。为此，笔者愿提醒一句：查“倒儿”时可千万别让“房倒”漏网。
