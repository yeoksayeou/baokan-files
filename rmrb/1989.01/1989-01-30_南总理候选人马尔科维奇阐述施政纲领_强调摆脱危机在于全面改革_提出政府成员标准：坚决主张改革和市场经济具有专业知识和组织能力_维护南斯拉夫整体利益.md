Yugoslav Prime Minister candidate Marković outlines policy agenda
Emphasizes overcoming crisis through comprehensive reform
Proposes government member criteria: firmly advocate reform and market economy, possess professional knowledge and organizational skills, uphold overall interests of Yugoslavia

BEIJING, Jan. 28 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Federal Government Prime Minister candidate Marković emphasized that the way for Yugoslavia to overcome its current crisis lies in comprehensive reform.

Marković made these remarks today at the meeting of the Federal Presidency of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia while elaborating on the basis of his policy agenda and the criteria for selecting government members. The live broadcast of Marković's speech was aired nationwide by Belgrade Television today.

Marković pointed out that Yugoslavia is currently facing a severe crisis. Over the past eight to nine years, social production has stagnated, economic efficiency is poor, technological development is lagging, inflation is worsening, living standards are declining, and public dissatisfaction has escalated to the point of strikes and street protests.

In analyzing the causes of the crisis, Marković believes that there is a dogmatic understanding of the nature of socialism, particularly the nature of the market. He said that the market is a product of human civilization, a means to improve economic efficiency and accelerate economic development. Equating the market with capitalism was a big mistake in the past.

Marković pointed out that patching up the existing system and ideology cannot solve the problem; instead, a completely new type of socialism centered on people should be built.

When discussing the role of the state, Marković said that the state has a very important function in the economic sphere but cannot replace the functions of the market and economic entities. Therefore, it is necessary to respect economic laws and reduce administrative regulation. He stressed that at least one-third of government institutions should be streamlined.

Marković believes that the current priority is to mobilize the enthusiasm of workers, strive to revitalize production, expand exports, increase foreign exchange earnings, and create conditions to curb inflation. He also mentioned the need to strengthen financial discipline, reduce budget expenditures, change the economic structure, and break the closed state of the domestic market in Yugoslavia.

When discussing the criteria for selecting government members, Marković emphasized that government members must firmly advocate for reform and a market economy, possess professional knowledge and organizational skills, and be able to uphold the overall interests of Yugoslavia without being constrained by local interests. He stated that if consensus cannot be reached on his policy agenda during the cabinet formation process and an ideal leadership team cannot be formed, he would rather give up on forming the cabinet.

The attendees expressed support for Marković's speech. The meeting decided that the republics and autonomous provinces will finalize the new government members with Marković by February 25, so that the Federal Assembly can elect the new Federal Government in early March.

    强调摆脱危机在于全面改革    
    提出政府成员标准：坚决主张改革和市场经济具有专业知识和组织能力  维护南斯拉夫整体利益
    新华社贝尔格莱德１月２８日电　南斯拉夫联邦政府总理候选人马尔科维奇强调，南斯拉夫摆脱当前危机的出路在于进行全面的改革。
    马尔科维奇今天是在南斯拉夫劳动人民社会主义联盟联邦会议主席团会议上阐述他的施政纲领基础和选择政府成员标准时说这番话的。贝尔格莱德电视台今天向全国直接转播了马尔科维奇讲话的实况。
    马尔科维奇指出，南斯拉夫当前的危机是深重的，近八九年来社会生产停滞，经济效益差，技术发展落后，通货膨胀日益严重，人民生活水平下降，群众的不满已发展到罢工和上街的程度。
    在分析造成危机的原因时，马尔科维奇认为，在对社会主义性质、首先是对市场性质的认识上存在着教条主义思想。他说，市场是人类文明发展的成果，是提高经济效益和加速经济发展的手段，过去把市场和资本主义等同起来是个大错误。
    马尔科维奇指出，对现行体制和意识形态修修补补不能解决问题，应该建设以人为中心的完全新型的社会主义。
    在谈到国家的作用时，马尔科维奇说，国家在经济领域具有十分重要的职能，但不能取代市场的职能和经济实体的职能。因此，必须尊重经济规律，减少行政调节。他强调，必须至少精简１／３政府机构。
    马尔科维奇认为，当前的首要任务是调动职工的积极性，努力搞活生产，扩大出口，增加外汇收入，为抑制通货膨胀创造条件。他还谈到了必须加强财经纪律、削减预算开支、改变经济结构、打破南国内市场的封闭状态等任务。
    在谈到选择政府成员的标准时，马尔科维奇强调，政府成员必须坚决主张实行改革和市场经济，具有专业知识和组织能力，能维护南斯拉夫整体利益而不受局部利益的约束。他表示，在组阁过程中，如果不能就他的施政纲领取得一致意见和不能组成一个理想的领导班子，他宁可放弃组阁。
    与会代表对马尔科维奇的讲话表示支持。会议决定，各共和国与自治省将在２月２５日前与马尔科维奇商定新政府成员人选，以便联邦议会能在３月初选举新的联邦政府。
