The third Pacific Energy Cooperation Conference, themed "Seeking Harmony Between Energy Utilization and Environmental Protection," concluded in Tokyo on January 24 after two days of discussions. Representatives from 14 countries and regions, as well as four international organizations, exchanged information and explored cooperative pathways during the conference.

The Pacific region accounts for 47% of the world's energy consumption. With the rapid economic growth in the region, energy consumption is increasing at nearly twice the global average rate. It is projected that by the year 2000, energy consumption will be 1.64 times that of 1986. Ensuring a stable energy supply is a major concern.

Participants noted that energy utilization and environmental protection are inseparable. Due to the significant increase in energy consumption in the Pacific region, particularly the rise in coal usage, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has surged, drawing attention to issues such as the greenhouse effect and acid rain. Participants suggested that efforts should be made to research energy-saving technologies and the development of new energy sources.

　　太平洋能源合作会议代表指出    
    能源利用和环保密不可分
    本报东京电  记者于青报道：历时两天的以“寻求能源利用和环境保护的和谐”为主题的第三次太平洋能源合作会议于２４日在东京闭幕。出席会议的１４个国家和地区、４个国际机构的代表，在会议期间交流信息，深入探讨合作的途径。
    太平洋地区能源消费量占全世界的４７％。随着该地区经济的迅速增长，能源消费量以世界平均消费量的近两倍的速度增长，预计到２０００年能源消费量将是１９８６年的１．６４倍。如何保证能源的稳定供给是人们关心的重大课题。
    与会者指出，能源利用和环境保护是密不可分的。由于太平洋地区能源消费量的显著增长，尤其是煤炭使用量的增加，二氧化碳在大气中的含量大量增加，温室效应和酸性雨的问题引起与会者的注意。与会者提出，应该积极研究节省能源和开发新能源的技术。
