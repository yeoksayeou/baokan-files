The Philippines achieved a bumper harvest in agriculture last year. According to a report from the Philippine Department of Agriculture, the country's grain production this year is expected to set a new record, with an estimated production of 13.5 million tons of rice and corn, an increase of 4.5 percent over last year.

Agriculture and Food Minister Carlos Dominguez said that the value of Philippine agriculture this year increased by 3.5 percent compared to last year.

He stated that 1988 was also a good year for the export of Philippine agricultural products. By September, the export value of agricultural products had reached $1.03 billion, an increase of 18 percent over the same period last year.

At the same time, the Philippines' diversified agriculture has also achieved good results. This year, the production of pork and chicken meat increased by 11.6 percent and 12.6 percent respectively compared to last year. Shrimp exports are expected to reach $200 million.

Dominguez attributed the agricultural bumper harvest to a series of agricultural reforms, including: diversified operations, partial privatization of agricultural product trade, restrictions on corn imports, and the abolition of all export taxes on agricultural products.

　　菲律宾去年农业丰收
    新华社马尼拉一九八八年十二月二十五日电  据菲律宾农业部报告，菲律宾今年粮食产量将创新纪录，预计大米和玉米产量为一千三百五十万吨，比去年增产百分之四点五。
    农业和粮食部长卡洛斯·多明格斯说，今年菲律宾农业产值比去年增长百分之三点五。
    他说，一九八八年也是菲律宾农产品出口好年景。到九月份为止，农产品出口额已达十点三亿美元，比去年同期增加百分之十八。
    与此同时，菲律宾农业多种经营也取得了好效果。今年猪肉和鸡肉产量分别比去年增长百分之十一点六和百分之十二点六。对虾出口可望达二亿美元。
    多明格斯将农业丰收归功于一系列的农业改革，其中包括：经营多样化、部分农产品贸易交给私人经营、限制玉米进口、取消所有农产品出口税等。
