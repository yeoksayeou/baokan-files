If only greetings had come earlier...

I was shocked to hear that a middle-aged scientist I was familiar with had worked himself to death and unfortunately passed away. I also heard that the factory director, party secretary, and personnel department leaders all rushed to express their condolences and inquire about the family's difficulties. This made me feel sad but also somewhat moved. However, after the initial feeling of being moved, I felt a sense of regret. I thought, if the aforementioned leaders had taken the time earlier to visit the family, arrange for a check-up, and supervise his health, perhaps...

Currently, there are indeed some leaders who, when it comes to scientific and technical personnel, often give more tasks and demand more results, but pay less attention to their living difficulties and health. After assigning tasks, they simply "let go," and as for any difficulties or conflicts, they only ask that you "exert your subjective initiative." Forget about visiting their homes; sometimes, even if you go to see them, you might have to make three or four trips before you can get an audience.

Nowadays, leaders in various fields are all very busy. But I think, if they could cut down on some of the less important things, like receptions and banquets, they should still be able to find some time. The key issue, however, is whether they respect knowledge and respect talent.

### 如果早一点问候……

　　如果早一点问候……
    王登平
    惊悉我所熟悉的一位中年科技人员积劳成疾，不幸病逝，又听说他所在厂的厂长、书记、人事科等领导闻讯纷纷前去致哀慰问，询问其亲属有什么困难。这使我悲痛之中颇有点感动。然而，感动之余又有点遗憾。我想，如果上述领导同志早能抽空到该同志家坐坐，安排督促他查查身体，或许……
    现在确有少数做领导工作的同志，对科技人员往往是交待任务多，要求成果多，而对他们生活困难过问少，身体健康关心少。交待了任务便“大撒把”，至于有什么困难、矛盾，只要求你“发挥主观能动性”了。甭说到家里坐坐，有时你去求见，跑个三、两趟也见不着。
    现在，各行各业领导大都很忙。但我想，如把那些无足轻重的，像招待会、宴请之类砍去一些，总还是可以挤点时间的，关键恐怕还是尊重知识、尊重人才的问题。
