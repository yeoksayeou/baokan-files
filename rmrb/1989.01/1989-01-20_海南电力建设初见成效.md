Hainan's power construction has seen initial success since the province was established last year. A number of projects have been completed, adding 150,000 kilowatts of installed capacity, bringing the province's total installed capacity to 430,000 kilowatts. The problem of power shortages, which had severely hindered the development of the Hainan Special Economic Zone and the lives of the people, has been somewhat alleviated.

Hainan previously relied mainly on hydropower. In April last year, the first 50,000-kilowatt gas turbine power plant was completed, addressing the urgent need. The construction of the first phase of the Haikou Thermal Power Plant, which began last year, has accelerated. The first 50,000-kilowatt unit was connected to the grid and started generating power in September, and the second 50,000-kilowatt unit was also completed and connected to the grid at the beginning of this year.

　　海南电力建设初见成效
    据新华社电  （记者陈江）海南自去年建省以来，电力建设顺利展开。目前，已建成一批项目，新增装机容量１５万千瓦，使全省电力装机总容量达４３万千瓦。曾经严重困扰海南经济特区开发建设和群众生活的电力不足问题有所改善。
    海南过去主要利用水力发电。去年４月首先建成了装机５万千瓦的海南燃气轮机发电厂，解决了燃眉之急。去年初动工兴建的海口火电厂一期工程的建设速度进一步加快，去年９月５万千瓦的第一台机组并网发电，第二台５万千瓦的发电机组今年初也已建成并网发电。
