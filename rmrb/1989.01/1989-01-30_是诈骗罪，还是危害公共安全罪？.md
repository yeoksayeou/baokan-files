In early April 1987, Chen Yintao, a farmer from Pingtouling Village, Datan Township, Luotian County, Hubei Province, and his father-in-law Huang Xunqun signed a "white ant control" contract with the Hanjiang Flood Control and Bank Protection Section of Qianjiang City. The contract stipulated that for each nest of white ants with a queen and king dug out in the sections of the Hanjiang River embankment at Yuan Tou Dongyue Temple and Heiliu Ferry, the section would pay 40 to 50 yuan. After the contract was signed, Chen Yintao, Huang Xunqun, Qiu Libin, Qiu Jifang, Yang Ziliang, Huang Xixiang, and Chen Huatao repeatedly traveled between Zhongxiang, Jingmen, and Zhijiang, digging up large quantities of white ants and transporting them to three sections of the Hanjiang River embankment. They would bury the white ants in the embankment at night and then dig them out in the daytime in front of the embankment management personnel. From mid-April to mid-May 1987, they dug up 113 nests of white ants that had been buried earlier, fraudulently obtaining 4,880 yuan in cash from the Hanjiang Flood Control and Bank Protection Section.

After tasting success, Chen Yintao and Huang Xunqun, using the same method, signed a so-called "white ant control" contract with the Dongjinghe Flood Control and Bank Protection Section of Qianjiang City on May 7, 1987. On the night of November 17, when Chen Yintao and others were again at the Dongjinghe embankment section to commit the crime, they were discovered by the embankment workers.

In March 1988, the public security authorities formally submitted this "white ant case" to the Qianjiang City People's Procuratorate for prosecution on charges of fraud. Comrade Zhu Gongcheng, who has rich experience in handling cases, took charge of this case.

After carefully reviewing the case files, Zhu Gongcheng believed that this "white ant case," from the direct purpose, was to defraud money and endanger public safety. Therefore, two issues needed to be clarified. First, could the white ants dug from other places survive on the river embankment? Second, even if they could survive, could the white ants, after being divided into smaller nests, reproduce on the river embankment? If they could neither survive nor reproduce, then this case could not be charged with "endangering public safety." This was the crux of the matter and the key to the case.

To clarify the above two key issues, Zhu Gongcheng read a large number of relevant books and materials and repeatedly brought the dug-up white ants to relevant departments for technical identification. Finally, he concluded that the white ants moved from Zhongxiang, Jingmen, and Zhijiang to the embankments of the Jianghan Plain could survive and reproduce, thus effectively solving the problem of white ant "survival" and "reproduction."

On July 7, 1988, after court investigation, debate, and deliberation, the Qianjiang City People's Court sentenced Chen Yintao, Qiu Libin, and seven other defendants to 2 to 8 years of imprisonment for "endangering public safety by burying white ants in the embankment."

### 是诈骗罪，还是危害公共安全罪？

　　是诈骗罪，还是危害公共安全罪？
    １９８７年４月上旬，湖北省罗田县大畴乡平头岭村农民陈银涛与其岳父黄舜坤与潜江市汉江修防总段签订了“防治白蚁”合同。合同规定，在汉江大堤的渊头东岳庙、黑流渡的堤段上，每挖出一巢有蚁王、蚁后的白蚁，由总段付款４０至５０元。合同签订后，陈银涛、黄舜坤、邱利斌、邱继芳、杨子良及黄喜望、陈华涛等人，先后多次往返于钟祥、荆门、枝江等地，挖出大量白蚁，运到汉江大堤三个堤段上，趁黑夜分别偷埋在江堤上，然后在白天又当着堤段管理人员的面挖出。从１９８７年４月中旬至５月中旬，他们共挖出事先埋下的白蚁１１３巢，从中骗取汉江修防总段现金４８８０元。
    陈银涛、黄舜坤等人尝到甜头后，又于１９８７年５月７日，以同样手段同潜江市东荆河修防总段签订了所谓“防治白蚁”合同。１１月１７日夜晚，当陈银涛等人再次来到东荆河堤段作案时，被堤段工作人员发现。
    １９８８年３月，公安机关以诈骗罪正式将这起“白蚁案”提请潜江市人民检察院审查起诉。具有丰富办案经验的朱功成同志承办了此案。
    通过认真仔细阅卷，朱功成认为，这起“白蚁案”，从直接目的来看，被告人是为了骗钱；危害了公共安全。为此，必须弄清两个问题。其一，从他处挖来的白蚁，能否在江堤上生存？其二，即使能生存，由大巢分成小巢后，这些白蚁能否在江堤上繁殖后代？如果既不能生存，又不能繁殖后代，那么，此案也就定不上“危害公共安全罪”了。这是问题的焦点，也是案情的关键。
    为了弄清上述两个关键性的问题，朱功成同志阅读了大量有关书籍及资料，并多次带着挖出的白蚁到有关部门进行技术鉴定，终于得出了结论：将钟祥、荆门、枝江等地的白蚁移居到江汉平原江堤后，完全能够生存下来，并能繁殖后代，从而很好地解决了关于白蚁“生存”和“繁殖”的难题。
    １９８８年７月７日，潜江市人民法院经过法庭庭审调查、辩论、合议，以“以在江堤上埋白蚁的危险方法危害公共安全罪”对陈银涛、邱利斌等７名被告分别判处２至８年有期徒刑。
