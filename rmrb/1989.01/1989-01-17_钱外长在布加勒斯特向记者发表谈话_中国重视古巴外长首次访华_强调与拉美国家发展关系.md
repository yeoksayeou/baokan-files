Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said that China attaches great importance to the first visit to China by Cuban Foreign Minister Isidoro Malmierca. He believes that the visit will be successful and will make a positive contribution to the further development of bilateral relations in various fields.

Qian, who is on an official friendly visit to Romania, met with Maria Gonzalez, a reporter from the Latin American News Agency in Romania, and gave a written statement to her today in Bucharest.

Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Cuba, the Cuban Foreign Minister will make his first visit to China.

Chinese Foreign Minister Qian said that in recent years, with the joint efforts of both sides, the relations between the two countries have been continuously improving. The exchanges and cooperation between the two countries in the fields of economy, culture, science and technology, education, sports, and health have made remarkable progress. There are many common points between the two countries in international affairs.

When talking about Sino-Cuban economic and trade relations, the Chinese Foreign Minister said that the trade between the two countries has progressed smoothly and is growing steadily. In 1988, Sino-Cuban trade reached $300 million, setting a historical record. Recently, the first ministerial-level economic and trade mixed committee of the two countries was successfully held in Beijing, and economic cooperation between the two countries has started. The Chinese Foreign Minister said he was satisfied with these developments in the relationship between the two countries.

Qian said that he recently met with the Cuban Foreign Minister in Paris. The Cuban Foreign Minister invited him to visit Cuba this year, and he was pleased to accept the invitation.

Qian said that Latin America is a vibrant and promising continent. The Chinese government attaches great importance to developing relations with Latin American countries.

Qian, who is on an official friendly visit to Romania, gave a written statement to reporters from the Latin American News Agency in Romania today in Bucharest. He said that China has now established diplomatic relations with 20 Latin American countries. Since the 1980s, the Chinese Premier has visited Latin America twice, and 10 presidents and 6 prime ministers from Latin America have visited China. The friendly cooperation between China and Latin American countries in politics, economy, culture, science and technology, and other fields is steadily developing, and he is satisfied with this.

When talking about Sino-Latin American trade relations, Qian said that this relationship is developing steadily and has maintained a level of around $2 billion in recent years. He pointed out that the trade volume between China and Latin America is still small compared to the potential of both sides. The main reasons are the geographical distance, the lack of matching import and export commodity structures, and insufficient understanding of each other's commodity needs. However, both China and Latin America have rich resources, broad markets, and a common desire to develop cooperation. He believes that as long as both sides continue to explore new cooperation paths and trade methods, the prospects for the development of Sino-Latin American trade are broad.

The Chinese Foreign Minister said that China and Latin America are both developing countries and belong to the Third World. There are no fundamental conflicts of interest between us, but there are many common points. Therefore, the development of Sino-Latin American relations has a good foundation. He said that there are still some Latin American countries that have not established diplomatic relations with China. China is willing to establish and develop friendly cooperative relations with all Latin American countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

　　钱外长在布加勒斯特向记者发表谈话

　　强调与拉美国家发展关系
    新华社布加勒斯特１月１５日电  中国外长钱其琛说，中国重视古巴外长马尔米耶卡的首次访华。他相信访问会取得圆满成功，为今后两国各方面关系的进一步发展做出积极的贡献。
    正在罗马尼亚进行正式友好访问的钱其琛外长今天在这里接见了拉美社驻罗记者玛丽亚·冈萨雷斯，并向她发表了书面谈话。
    中古建交后古巴外长即将首次访华。
    中国外长说，最近几年，在中古双方的共同努力下，两国关系不断改善，两国在经济、文化、科技、教育、体育、卫生等方面的交往与合作有了显著的发展。在国际事务中两国之间有许多共同点。
    在谈到中古经贸关系时，中国外长说，两国的贸易进展顺利，持续增长。１９８８年中古贸易达到了３亿美元，创历史最高纪录。不久前，两国部长级经贸混合委员会首次在北京成功召开，两国的经济合作已经起步。中国外长说，他对两国关系的这些进展感到满意。
    钱其琛说，最近他在巴黎会见了古巴外长。古巴外长邀请他今年访问古巴，他愉快地接受了这一邀请。
    新华社布加勒斯特１月１５日电　中国外长钱其琛说，拉丁美洲是一个很有生气、大有希望的大陆。中国政府十分重视发展同拉美国家的关系。
    正在罗马尼亚进行正式友好访问的钱其琛外长今天在这里对拉美通讯社驻罗记者发表了书面谈话。他说，目前，中国已同２０个拉美国家建立了外交关系。８０年代以来，中国总理已两次访问拉美，而拉美已有１０个国家的总统和６个国家的总理访问了中国。中国和拉美国家在政治、经济、文化、科技等各方面的友好合作关系正稳步向前发展，对此，他感到满意。
    在谈到中拉贸易关系时，钱其琛说，这种关系正在持续发展，近几年基本保持在２０亿美元左右的水平上。他指出，中拉贸易额与双方所具有的潜力相比还不大，其主要原因是地理位置相距遥远，双方进出口商品结构不太对路，对对方的商品需求还不够了解等。但中拉双方有着丰富的资源、广阔的市场，并且都有发展合作的共同愿望。他相信，只要双方继续努力探讨新的合作途径和贸易方式，中拉贸易发展的前景是广阔的。
    中国外长说，中国和拉美都是发展中国家，同属第三世界，我们之间没有根本的利害冲突，而共同点却很多。因此，发展中拉关系有着良好的基础。他说，目前尚有一些拉美国家未同中国建交。中国愿在和平共处五项原则基础上同所有拉美国家建立和发展友好合作关系。
