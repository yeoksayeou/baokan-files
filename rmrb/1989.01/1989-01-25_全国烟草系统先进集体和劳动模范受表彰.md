On January 24, the State Tobacco Monopoly Bureau and the China National Tobacco Corporation held a telephone conference to commend the advanced collectives and labor models in the national tobacco system. Leaders from the tobacco companies of 29 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, as well as representatives of advanced collectives and labor models, participated in the meeting from their respective locations.

Since 1982, China's tobacco industry has formed an economic entity with centralized and unified management of production, supply, sales, personnel, finance, materials, and domestic and foreign trade. On the basis of strengthening the monopoly system and striving to deepen industry reforms, the economic benefits of the tobacco industry have continued to grow significantly. From 1982 to 1988, the industry cumulatively achieved tax revenues of 10.1 billion yuan, making a significant contribution to the state.
