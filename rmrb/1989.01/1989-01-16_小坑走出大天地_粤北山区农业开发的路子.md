A reporter from our newspaper visited Xiaokeng Town in Qujiang County, Northern Guangdong. The town is lush with green mountains and clear waters, and the forests are dense with abundant grain. The more one looks, the more one wants to see. Driving through the forest roads, one sees no signs of indiscriminate logging or wildfires destroying the forests. The entire forest area is well-managed, with firebreaks and clean roads on both sides, as well as corresponding forest protection agreements, effectively eliminating the threat of wildfires.

This is a state-owned and collective, town and market combined, forestry town. The entire town has 1 state-owned forest farm, 4 village committees, and a population of over 50,000, covering a total area of 240,000 mu. Currently, the town's forest coverage rate has reached 83.5%, with 740,000 cubic meters of standing timber on the mountains, valued at over 200 million yuan. This is a "green bank."

"Borrowing mountains to plant forests" is one of their innovations. After completing the task of afforesting barren mountains in 1977, the town faced new contradictions: the population was increasing, but the area of mountain operations could not be expanded; the state-owned forest farm's technology and forestry experience could not be fully utilized; the surplus funds of the state-owned forest farm could not be increased in value; but neighboring towns and counties lacked funds and technology, making it impossible to plant trees on large areas of suitable barren mountains. How to expand the path of forestry? They joined forces with neighboring towns and counties, utilizing each other's advantages to achieve an optimal combination of production factors, forming new productive forces. Starting in 1983, the town invested 440,000 yuan to jointly plant 11,000 mu of forests with the neighboring towns of Huoshan and Datang. In 1986, they jointly established two forestry sub-farms covering 161,000 mu with the towns of Lingxi, Dajiao, and Fengwan, investing 880,000 yuan. The total area of jointly planted forests in the town is 1.9 times the original area of the state-owned forest farm.

Joint forestry relies on policy guarantees. They implemented the policy of "mountain ownership unchanged, forest ownership shared, risks shared, benefits shared," signing contracts valid for 60 years. In management, they adopted the form of household contract operations, directly linking the interests of farmers with the economic benefits of the forest farm, so that both parties can be enthusiastic. Currently, the survival rate of seedlings in jointly planted forest land is over 90%.

"Using forests to retain water, using water to generate electricity, using electricity to promote industry, and comprehensive operations" is the path that Xiaokeng Town has continuously explored to accelerate the pace of wealth for the people, and to improve economic, social, and ecological benefits. With more forests comes more water. The town's 6 streams previously had only 3 flows, but now there are 6 flows even in the dry season. Rich in water resources, the town has 10,000 kilowatts of developable hydropower. They have paid attention to leveraging this advantage, successively building 15 small hydropower stations with a total installed capacity of 6,870 kilowatts, accounting for 73.8% of the developable hydropower, with a per capita capacity of 1.3 kilowatts. This year, the power generation can reach 25 million kilowatt-hours, with a total income of 1.5 million yuan. Small hydropower has opened up new revenue sources, creating conditions for increasing investment in forestry and the distribution to the people. They allocate 500,000 to 600,000 yuan from the electricity fees each year to increase investment in forestry and 100,000 to 200,000 yuan to increase farmers' distribution, making the per capita income of forest farmers increase by 30 to 40 yuan. With abundant electricity resources, the town has successively established more than 10 factories, including wood bead factories, bamboo product processing factories, and metal silicon factories. The bamboo product processing factory, which cooperates with Taiwanese investors to produce "versatile bamboo sheets," has products that can be sold overseas, with a monthly output value of about 60,000 yuan. In recent years, Xiaokeng Town has achieved a combination of afforestation and fruit planting, planting and breeding, and agricultural and industrial development. The town has planted various fruit trees covering 14,000 mu, with nearly 2 mu of fruit trees per rural household. Using tree tops and tails to process wood shavings into bags for cultivating winter mushrooms, with an annual output of 20,000 kilograms of dried mushrooms. Using rivers, reservoirs, fish ponds, and other water surfaces and fruit orchards to raise chickens, ducks, geese, rabbits, pigs, and other livestock. The town's agricultural product commercialization rate has reached 72.8%, with a per capita income of 814 yuan, ranking first in Qujiang County. Town leader Zhang Shengjia told the reporter: "We have also increased our investment in agriculture, spending 460,000 yuan to support the improvement of rice varieties, with yields increasing from the previous 200-300 kilograms per mu to over 500 kilograms per mu for several consecutive years. In the past few years, we used to rely on the state for 70,000-80,000 kilograms of returned grain, but this year we can sell over 90,000 kilograms of grain to the state. We have also increased educational funds by 1.58 million yuan, improving the conditions for education in the mountainous areas, and the enrollment rate of children has reached 98.2%."

"Xiaokeng" has stepped out into the vast world, and its path provides inspiration.

Qujiang County has established a forestry fund system, invested in factory and mine projects, and raised funds through various means such as townships, villages, and farmers' self-raising, totaling over 16 million yuan. This has greened 1 million mu of barren mountains, with the invested funds equaling four times the total forestry investment in the county since its liberation up to 1986.

　　小坑走出大天地
    ——粤北山区农业开发的路子
    本报记者  段存章
    记者到粤北曲江县小坑镇采访，只见全镇山青水秀，林茂粮丰，越看越想看。坐车穿行林间公路，看不到乱砍乱伐，也没有发现野火毁林。整个林区管理井井有条，一道道防火线和两边毛草刮扫干净的公路，以及相应的护林公约，正在消除山火隐患。
    这是一个国营带集体、镇场合一的林业镇。全镇有１个国营林场、４个村民委员会，５万多人口，总面积２４万亩。现在全镇森林覆盖率达８３．５％，山上活立木蓄积量７４万立方米，价值２亿多元。这是一所“绿色银行”。
    “借山造林”，是他们的一个创举。这个镇在１９７７年完成荒山造林任务后，又出现了新的矛盾：人口不断增长，但山地经营面积得不到扩大；国营林场的技术和营林经验得不到充分的利用；富余的国营林场资金得不到增值；但附近乡（镇）却因缺乏资金和技术，使大片的宜林荒山无法种上树。如何拓宽林业之路？他们同毗邻乡镇联合起来，利用各自优势，实现双方生产要素的优化组合，使之形成新的生产力。从１９８３年开始，这个镇投资４４万元，与邻近的火山、大塘两个乡（镇）联合造林１．１万亩。１９８６年，他们又与灵溪、大桥、枫湾等乡镇联合，投资８８万元，办起了面积为１６．１万亩的两个林业分场。全镇联合造林面积比原来国营林场面积增加了１．９倍。
    联合造林靠政策保证。他们实行“山权不变，林权共有，风险同担，利益共享”的方针，签订了一定６０年的合同。在管理上，他们采取了家庭承包经营形式，使农户的利益与林场的经济效益直接挂钩，双方积极性都可以得到发挥。现在联合造林的林地苗木成活率达９０％以上。
    “以林涵水，以水办电，以电促工，综合经营”，这是小坑镇不断探索出的一条加快群众致富步伐，提高经济效益、社会效益、生态效益的路子。林多水多，全镇６条溪过去只有３个流量，现在枯水期也有６个流量。水力资源丰富，可开发的水力资源达１万千瓦。他们注意发挥这一优势，先后建起了小水电站１５座，总装机容量达６８７０千瓦，占可开发水力７３．８％，人均达１．３千瓦。今年发电量可达２５００万度，总收入１５０万元。小水电开辟了新的财源，为增加林业的投入和群众的分配创造了条件。他们每年从电费收入中拿出五六十万元增加林业的投资，拿出一二十万元增加农民分配，使林农人均增收三四十元。有了丰富的电力资源，全镇先后办起了木珠厂、竹器加工厂、金属硅厂等１０多个工厂。与台商合作生产“万能竹片”的竹器加工厂，产品可销往国外，月产值可达６万元左右。近几年，小坑镇做到造林和种果结合，种植和养殖结合，农业开发和工业开发结合。全镇已种下各种果树１４００亩，农村户均有果树近２亩。利用树头树尾加工成木糠袋育冬菇，年产干菇２万公斤。利用河流、水库、鱼塘等水面和林果场地养鸡、鸭、鹅、兔、猪等畜禽。全镇农产品商品率达７２．８％，人均收入８１４元，居曲江县之冠。镇负责人张声加对记者说：“我们对农业投入也增加，花４６万元扶持水稻优种化，亩产从过去的二三百公斤，连续几年亩产超５００公斤。前些年吃国家返销粮七八万公斤，今年可卖给国家粮食九万公斤以上。还增加教育经费１５８万元，改善了山区的办学条件，儿童入学率达到９８．２％。”
    “小坑”走出大天地，它的路子给人们以启示。
    曲江县通过建立林业基金制度、厂矿投资办点、乡镇村农户自筹等十多种办法，共筹集资金１６００多万元，绿化了１００万亩荒山，投入的资金等于全县解放以来到１９８６年林业投资总和的４倍。
