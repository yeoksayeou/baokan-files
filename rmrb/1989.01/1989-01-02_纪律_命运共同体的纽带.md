Discipline is essential in battle, and it is equally crucial in production. Without discipline, large-scale socialized production cannot proceed for even a minute. Yet, why do many of our enterprises suffer from lax management and slack discipline? Why do some foreigners, while labeling us as "lazy Chinese," also call us "slack Chinese"?

Are Chinese people inherently lazy? No! Chinese people have a tradition of hard work and discipline. It is the "iron rice bowl" system that has made people lazy and scattered their spirits. The "iron rice bowl" system severed the material interests of workers from the enterprise. The development of the factory has nothing to do with me; the decline of the factory still means I get paid. Over time, how can people not become lazy, and how can discipline be strict?

The pursuit of material interests is the most basic motivation for people to work. In the past, we emphasized collective interests too much while neglecting or even suppressing individual interests, treating them as opposites. In reality, they are complementary. Collective interests are the sum of individual interests. Without individual interests, collective interests become empty talk; individual interests cannot exist without collective interests. Collective interests, when realized, create conditions for the realization of individual interests. They are not oil and water, nor are they fire and water; they are intertwined. Reform should raise a clear slogan: build a community of shared destiny, closely linking the interests of workers with those of the enterprise, so that both suffer when one suffers and both prosper when one prospers. Workers' hard work to pursue their own interests brings prosperity to the enterprise; the enterprise's prosperity brings more benefits to the workers.

At this point, discipline becomes the bond of the community of shared destiny. To protect the interests of the community of shared destiny, strict discipline is necessary. Discipline often restrains a few undisciplined individuals but protects the majority. Discipline protects the interests of the enterprise and also the interests of each worker. Discipline becomes something closely related to the personal interests of workers, making it easier for them to accept strict management and discipline, as the workers of "Yuhua" said: "We don't mind strict management, as long as it brings us benefits."

With the deepening of enterprise reform, the "iron rice bowl" is being broken, and workers and enterprises are beginning to form a community of shared destiny. The slogan "The factory prospers, I am proud; the factory declines, I am ashamed" has been recognized by workers. Accelerate reform, enforce strict management, and closely link the interests of workers with those of the enterprise. The labels of "lazy" and "slack" will no longer be associated with Chinese people.

### 纪律——命运共同体的纽带

　　纪律——命运共同体的纽带
    打仗要有纪律，生产同样也要有纪律。没有纪律，社会化大生产一分钟也进行不下去。可是，为什么在我们的许多企业里却是管理不严、纪律松弛呢？为什么一些外国人在称我们是“懒惰的中国人”的同时，又送给我们一个“松松垮垮的中国人”的称号呢？
    中国人天生就懒散吗？不！中国人本来具有勤劳刻苦、遵守纪律的传统，只是“大锅饭”的体制养懒了身子，弄散了心劲。“大锅饭”割断了职工与企业的物质利益联系。工厂发展，与我无关；工厂衰败，照样吃饭。长此以往，人岂能不懒，纪律又怎么能严明？
    追求物质利益是人们从事劳动的最基本动力。过去，我们过多地强调集体利益，而轻视甚至压制个人利益，把个人利益与集体利益对立起来，其实，二者是相辅相成的。集体利益是个人利益的集合，没有个人利益，集体利益就成了空话；个人利益又离不开集体利益，集体利益的实现为个人利益的实现创造了条件。二者不是油水分离，更不是水火难容，而是水乳交融。改革应提出响亮的口号：建立命运共同体，把职工的利益与企业的利益紧密地结合在一起，一损俱损，一荣俱荣。职工辛勤劳动追求自己的利益，带来企业兴旺；企业兴旺，职工会得到更多的实惠。
    这时的纪律就成了命运共同体的纽带。为了维护命运共同体利益，就必须有严格纪律。纪律往往是对少数不守纪律的人的约束，而是对大多数人的保护；纪律维护的是企业的利益，也维护的是每个职工的利益，纪律成了与职工切身利益相关的东西，职工就容易服从严格的管理，接受严明的纪律，正如“宇华”工人所说：严格管理我们不怕，只要能给我们带来实惠就行。
    随着企业改革的深入，“大锅饭”正在被打碎，职工与企业开始形成命运共同体，“厂兴我荣，厂衰我耻”的口号已被职工所认识。加速改革，严格管理，把职工利益与企业利益更紧密地结合起来，“懒惰”、“松松垮垮”的帽子将不属于中国人。
