    Strict Self-Discipline and Frugality; Avoiding Extravagance
    Yichun Leaders Maintain Integrity in Public Service

    According to a report, the leading cadres of the Yichun Municipal Committee and Administration Bureau in Jiangxi Province have consistently upheld integrity in public service and worked diligently. Among them, no one has used their influence to help family members with admissions, employment, or transfers; no one has engaged in business or enterprise activities, either personally or through family members; no one has accepted bribes or gifts in economic dealings; and no one has exceeded the standard for housing.

    During the process of strengthening the leadership team and rectifying party discipline, the Yichun Municipal Committee and Administration Bureau have always emphasized integrity as a key component. The committee has also proposed that any signs of misconduct should be addressed through education and self-correction, rather than punishment without prior warning. In 1987, this region experienced several significant incidents, including nitrate poisoning, the distribution of obscene videos, and policy violations related to "agricultural to non-agricultural" transfers. The Municipal Committee and Administration Bureau recognized that these problems originated at the grassroots level but also exposed deficiencies in the leadership's work, which was found to be superficial, incomplete, and ineffective.

    The Yichun Municipal Committee and Administration Bureau believe that while the region's fiscal revenue has increased in recent years, the foundation remains weak, and available funds are limited. To maintain integrity, it is essential to promote frugality and avoid extravagance, firmly resisting the trend of ostentation and extravagance. To this day, the offices of the Municipal Committee and Administration Bureau are still located in a building constructed in the 1950s with outdated facilities. The conference room of the Administration Bureau is a repurposed corridor. Out of the 13 members of the two leadership teams, 8 live in ordinary staff dormitories.

    To provide a good external environment for leading cadres, the region has implemented a cadre exchange system since 1985. In 1986, 11 county-level cadres were promoted from different locations, and 81 leading cadres were exchanged. The county-level party secretaries, discipline inspection commission secretaries, and organization department directors responsible for party and group work in each county and city were not appointed from local cadres. In 1988, a total of 2,866 cadres from the entire region's party and government agencies and public institutions were transferred to the front lines of economic work, including 585 cadres from municipal-level units.

　　严于律己　尚俭戒奢
    宜春领导干部廉洁奉公
    本报讯  江西省宜春地委、行署的领导干部坚持廉洁奉公，艰苦创业。他们之中，没有人为家属子女在升学、招工、转干中走后门；没有本人或家属子女参与经商办企业的；没有人在经济交往中接受贿赂和馈赠；没有人超标准住房。
    宜春地委、行署在搞好领导班子建设、端正党风过程中，始终把廉政作为重要内容。地委还提出，对违纪行为一旦发现苗头就要事先教育，启发犯有错误的同志自觉改正，不搞不教而诛。１９８７年，这个地区连续出现硝盐中毒、放淫秽录相和违反政策“农转非”等影响较大的事件。地委、行署认为，问题出在基层，但暴露了领导机关工作的不深、不细、不实。
    宜春地委、行署认为，这几年，全地区财政虽然增收，但毕竟底子薄，可用的钱有限，要保持廉洁就要尚俭戒奢，坚决抵制摆阔气、讲排场的奢侈风。直到现在，地委、行署机关仍在一幢５０年代建的设备简陋的楼房里办公。行署会议室是利用过道改装的。两套班子的１３位领导成员中有８位同志住在一般干部的宿舍。
    为使领导干部有一个好的外部环境，这个地区从１９８５年开始实行领导干部交流。１９８６年异地提拔县级干部１１人，交流领导干部８１人，各县市分管党群工作的副书记、纪委书记和组织部长，都不由本地干部担任。１９８８年全区党政机关、事业单位转移２８６６名干部到经济工作第一线，其中地直单位转移干部５８５名。
