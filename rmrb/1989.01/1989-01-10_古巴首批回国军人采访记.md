After a rainstorm, the sky in Luanda cleared up on January 8. The reporter, along with nearly 80 foreign journalists who had recently arrived, interviewed the first batch of Cuban soldiers who were about to return home at a Cuban military camp near Luanda International Airport.

At the camp gate, Cuban female press officer Julia introduced that, according to the agreement signed by Angola and Cuba on December 22, 1988, in New York, the 50,000 Cuban troops stationed in Angola would begin withdrawing from April 1, 2000, over a period of 27 months. Before April 1, 3,000 troops would be withdrawn first. The first batch of 450 troops would depart on January 10, flying back to Cuba on three civilian aircraft.

Later, a female lieutenant named Ada Basios, who was in charge of Cuban military affairs, accompanied the reporters inside the camp. This camp serves as a transit station for Cuban troops arriving in and departing from Luanda, consisting of more than ten rows of makeshift huts. From the camp, one can see several fighter jets on the nearby airport tarmac. Inside the camp, walls are adorned with portraits and quotes of Castro. Fully armed Cuban guards stand at the main gate and several intersections. About 400 Cuban men and women soldiers were freely moving around the courtyard, some playing volleyball, others watching videos, a few gathered around a chess game, and a small group drinking and chatting in a bar. Lieutenant Ada pointed to this batch of soldiers and said, "These 450 people come from various branches of the Cuban military in Angola, including the air force, infantry, artillery, engineering, and logistics units." The first batch of soldiers returning home represents various units of the Cuban forces in Angola. When asked when she would return home, she replied, "I have been here for a year and will leave in the second batch, but I don't know when the second batch will depart."

The Cuban military arrived in Angola in October 1975. Over the past 13 years, they have primarily been stationed in major cities and important economic and military facilities, participating in battles against the invading South African forces. As the conflict escalated, the number of Cuban troops grew from nearly 10,000 to the current approximately 50,000. According to the Cuban side, nearly 300,000 Cuban soldiers have rotated through Angola over the past decade. It is also reported that the Angolan government pays nearly $600 million annually for these troops.

Since last year, driven by the global easing of tensions and the efforts of southern African countries and peoples, Angola, Cuba, South Africa, and the United States have engaged in eight months of arduous negotiations, finally signing the tripartite agreement on Namibian independence and Angolan peace in New York on December 22. This agreement includes the three-party agreement between Angola, Cuba, and South Africa, and the bilateral agreement between Angola and Cuba regarding the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola.

As the Cuban troops are about to begin their withdrawal, the reporter conducted an exclusive interview with the returning soldiers. Colonel Benancio Avila, who led the Cuban forces in strategic battles against South Africa in Quitokwanavale from January to October last year, said that upon returning home, he would first rest and reunite with his children. This military academy graduate from the Soviet Union admitted that the battles from January to March last year were very intense. He said, "South Africa's advantage is its artillery, while ours is the air force. Ultimately, we stopped the advance of the South African forces."

These Cuban soldiers are happy about the first batch returning home. Pedro Sulueda, a 23-year-old infantry lieutenant, said, "I am very happy to be in the first batch returning home. I got married just a year ago and came to Angola, and now I still don't have any children. I miss my wife, who is a teacher. I am not very accustomed to the climate here." Mequi, a 21-year-old female soldier, is short and looks like a child. She smiled and said, "I want to go home. I really miss home." Soldier Bitorre Belanques, who wears three medals, said, "I am proud to be in the first batch returning home. We have completed the mission given to us by the party and Castro." When asked what he wanted to do after returning home, he shrugged and spread his hands: "I don't know yet."

Unmarried Lieutenant Beltrin said in an interview, "I am also happy to return home, but if needed, I can stay longer."

The assembly signal sounded. The 450 Cuban soldiers stood in three rows, appearing spirited and full of anticipation for the upcoming reunion with their families. However, not all were the same. The reporter noticed that a colonel with a gloomy face and a cigar in his mouth stood to the side, remaining silent the entire time.

　　古巴首批回国军人采访记
    新华社记者  赵晓钟
    １月８日，罗安达市雨后放晴。记者与近日抵安的８０余名外国记者一道，在罗安达国际机场附近的一座古巴兵站采访了即将回国的首批古巴军人。
    在兵站门口迎候记者的古巴女新闻官员胡利亚纳首先介绍说，根据安哥拉和古巴１９８８年１２月２２日签署的纽约协议，古驻安的５万军人将从４月１日起在２７个月内逐步从安撤走。４月１日之前，将先撤３０００人。这些人中的第一批４５０人，于１０日分乘３架古巴民航机回国。
    随后，一位负责古军队工作的女中尉阿达·巴西奥斯陪同记者在兵站内采访。这座兵站是古军人员抵离罗安达的中转站，由十多排简易油毡房组成。在兵站可以望见不远处机场上的一架架战斗机。兵站内，墙壁上处处有卡斯特罗的画像和语录。大门和几处路口站有全副武装的古巴卫兵。４００多名古巴男女军人正在院内自由活动，有的在打排球，有的在看录像，墙边一些人在围观棋局，小酒吧内几个人在饮酒聊天。阿达中尉指着这批军人说，这４５０人来自古巴驻安哥拉的各个军种，包括空军、步兵、炮兵、工程兵及后勤部队等。首批回国的军人是古巴驻安各部队的代表。当记者询问她何时回国时，她说，“我来了一年，将于第二批撤走，但不知第二批的撤离时间。”
    古巴军队是１９７５年１０月来到安哥拉的。１３年来，他们主要驻守一些大城市以及重要的经济和军事设施，并参加对付入侵安哥拉的南非军队的战斗。随着战事扩大，古巴军人由近万人发展到目前的约５万人。据古巴方面称，１０多年来在轮换中到过安哥拉的古巴军人已近３０万人。另据报道，安哥拉政府每年要为这些人支付近６亿美元的费用。
    去年以来，在世界缓和局势的推动及南部非洲国家和人民的努力下，安、古、南非、美国４方经过８个月的艰巨谈判，终于在１２月２２日在纽约签署安古南非３方关于纳米比亚独立和安哥拉和平的三方协议、安古双方关于古巴从安哥拉撤军的协议。
    在古巴军人即将开始撤军之际，记者就回国军人的想法作了专访。去年１月至１０月率领古军在战略重镇奎图夸纳瓦莱与南非作战的贝南西奥·阿维拉上校表示，回国后首先要好好休息与家中孩子团聚。这位毕业于苏联军事学院的军人承认，去年１月至３月与南非的战斗十分激烈。他说：“南非的优势是炮兵，我们的优势是空军，我们最终阻止了南非军队的推进。”
    这些古巴军人对首批回国感到高兴。２３岁的步兵中尉佩德罗·苏卢埃达表示，很高兴首批回国，他说，“我结婚才一年就来安哥拉，如今还没有孩子，非常想念当教师的妻子。我对这里的气候也不大习惯。”２１岁的女军士梅基个头不高，一副孩子相，她笑着说，“我愿意回去，我真想家。”身佩３枚军功章的士兵比托雷·贝兰克斯表示，“我对首批回国感到自豪，我们完成了党和卡斯特罗交付的使命。”当记者问他回国后想干些什么时，他耸耸肩，摊开两手：“还不知道”。
    未婚女少尉贝尔廷在接受采访时说，“我也高兴回国，但如果需要，也可以继续呆下去。”
    集合哨声响了。４５０名古巴军人站成３个方队，他们看来精神饱满，对即将到来的亲人团聚充满憧憬。当然也不尽然。记者注意到，一位面色阴沉、叼着雪茄的中校在一旁始终一言不发。
