Treating Hypertension Does Not Always Require Medication – External Application of Clonidine Patches Also Lowers Blood Pressure

According to Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, January 5th – A type of external medication for treating hypertension with better efficacy and convenience compared to oral medication – Clonidine patches – was recently approved in Nanjing by the General Logistics Department of the People's Liberation Army.

The Clonidine patches, developed by the Nanjing Air Force Hospital, are about the size of a one-fen coin. Patients only need to apply it to the back of the ear or the chest, and the drug will automatically release into the body through the patch, steadily lowering blood pressure. The effect of a single application can last 3 to 7 days. Among the 125 patients who used Clonidine patches, the total effective rate was 88%, an increase of 24% compared to oral medication.

　　治疗高血压不必都吃药
    外贴可乐定药膜也降压
    据新华社南京１月５日电  （通讯员张久、记者徐机玲）一种比口服药疗效好、使用方便的治疗高血压外用药——可乐定贴片，日前在南京通过由解放军总后勤部组织的鉴定。
    由空军南京医院研制成功的可乐定贴片，只有一分钱硬币大小。患者只需将它贴在耳后或胸前，便可通过药膜自动向体内释放药物，平稳降压，一次疗效可达３—７天。使用可乐定贴片的１２５名患者，总有效率为８８％，比口服药提高２４％。
