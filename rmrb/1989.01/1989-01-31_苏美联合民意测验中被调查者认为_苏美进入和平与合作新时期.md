A joint Soviet-American telephone survey has shown that five out of six respondents believe that Soviet-American relations have entered a new era of peace and cooperation.

According to a report by TASS on January 29, last December, the Institute of Sociology of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and two American polling organizations conducted a telephone survey of 1,000 residents in each of the five cities of Moscow, Boston, Detroit, New York, and San Francisco on the issue of Soviet-American relations.

90% to 95% of the respondents felt that relations between the two countries had improved in recent years, while only 10% to 13% of Americans and 1% of Soviets still believed that relations between the two countries were hostile.

When asked about the balance of military power between the two countries, 70% of the respondents advocated maintaining military parity.

The vast majority of respondents believed that socialism and capitalism can coexist peacefully. This was the largest joint social survey conducted by the Soviet Union and the United States in recent years.

    苏美进入和平与合作新时期
    新华社莫斯科１月２９日电  苏美联合进行的电话民意测验表明，５／６的被调查者都认为，苏美进入了和平与合作的新时期。
    据塔斯社２９日报道，去年１２月，苏联科学院社会学研究所和美国两家民意调查机构就苏美关系问题，用电话分别对莫斯科、波士顿、底特律、纽约和旧金山５个城市各１０００名居民进行了民意调查。
    ９０％至９５％的被调查者认为，最近几年苏美关系有了改善，只有１０％至１３％的美国人和１％的苏联人仍认为两国关系处于敌对状态。
    在回答苏美军事力量对比的问题时，７０％的被调查者主张两国保持军事均势。
    绝大多数被调查者认为，社会主义与资本主义可以和平共处。这次是苏美近年来进行的规模最大的联合社会调查。
