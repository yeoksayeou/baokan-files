The coal platform in Zao Shi, operated by the Hunan Provincial Coal Company's Lei Yang Procurement and Transportation Station, is a key national coal storage and distribution hub, as well as a coal transportation dock. Each year, it ships thousands of tons of coal to various parts of the country. However, since March 1988, a few villagers from Sha Tou Village in Zao Shi Town have escalated from stealing coal at night to openly looting it. They not only loot at the loading and unloading docks but also use motorboats to intercept coal transport ships on the water, looting coal along the way. Currently, they have looted over 3,000 tons of coal, causing significant economic losses to the state.

　　耒阳灶市煤坪屡遭村民哄抢
    湖南省煤炭公司耒阳购运站灶市煤坪，是国家煤炭调运仓储重地，又是煤炭调运码头，每年向全国各地发运数千万吨煤炭。可是，一九八八年三月以来，灶市镇沙头村少数村民，从晚上偷煤发展到公开抢煤。他们不但在装卸码头抢，还驾着机动船，沿途拦截水上煤炭运输船队抢煤。目前，他们已抢走煤炭三千多吨，给国家造成一定的经济损失。
