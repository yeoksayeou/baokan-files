In recent years, a certain unit of the Guangzhou Military Region stationed in Hua County has had 13,000 meters of military antenna cables and 4,000 meters of military communication lines stolen or cut, resulting in a direct economic loss of 200,000 yuan. After investigation, the military discovered that the case was related to nearby villagers, but they feared that pursuing the matter would affect military-civilian relations and thus did not resolve it. However, indulgence did not make the criminals or some villagers mend their ways, and the thefts became increasingly rampant. Therefore, the military leadership reported the incident to the local public security authorities.

After receiving the report from the military, the Tanbu Town Police Station in Hua County attached great importance to it and immediately reported to the county public security bureau, requesting to file a case for investigation. They also established a joint investigation team consisting of personnel from the county public security bureau, the police station, and the military. They propagated relevant regulations to the villagers, explained the dangers, and persuaded the perpetrators to confess voluntarily. At the same time, based on the clues they had, they tracked and investigated, arresting 34 perpetrators. Among them, 2 were sentenced to prison, and 4 were detained. Since then, the military facilities and camp property of this unit have not been damaged again, and military-civilian relations have also improved significantly.

　　认真查处违法案件
    努力维护军民关系
    近年来，广州军区某部驻花县装备器材处先后有１．３万米军用天线、４０００多米军用通信线路被盗、被剪，直接经济损失２万元。经过侦查，部队了解到案子与附近村民有关，但又怕追究起来影响军民关系，一直没有解决。然而，迁就并没使犯罪分子及某些村民改邪归正，偷盗之风愈演愈烈。于是，部队领导同志向地方公安机关作了反映。
    花县炭步镇派出所得到部队报告后十分重视，立即上报县公安局，请求立案侦查，并成立了有县公安局、派出所及部队有关人员参加的侦破小组。他们一面向村民宣传有关法规，讲清危害，规劝作案者主动交代；一面根据掌握的线索跟踪追查，抓获了３４名作案者。其中２人被判刑，４人被拘留。以后，这个部队的军事设施和营区财产再也没有遭到破坏，军民关系也发生了可喜变化。
