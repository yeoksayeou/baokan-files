    The involvement of a West German company in the Libyan chemical weapons factory has drawn public attention, and the West German government is facing increasing internal and external pressure.

    Today, the West German customs investigation agency conducted a large-scale operation, searching 15 companies and the residences of 12 company executives suspected of involvement in the incident. These include the Imhausen Chemical Company, the residence of the company's chairman, Hippenschmidt-Imhausen, and the company's subsidiary, the Automation Company.

    According to the Offenbach Prosecutor's Office, a large amount of material was seized during the search, including a truckload of documents. The West German Federal Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee held a special meeting today on the Libyan chemical factory incident. It is reported that a government representative admitted at the meeting that this incident has caused significant damage to West Germany's foreign relations.

    According to Social Democratic Party (SPD) deputies Feucht and Gansel, there may be another company involved in the incident. They criticized the government, saying that in response to the 49 questions raised by the SPD regarding the Libyan chemical factory incident, neither Foreign Minister Genscher nor representatives from the Ministry of Economics and the Ministry of Finance provided any answers. The West German government is currently under internal and external pressure, investigating the incident thoroughly on one hand, and strengthening legal sanctions on the other. Genscher said today in Bonn during a meeting with the chairman of the American Jewish World Congress, Brownfield, that West Germany will spare no effort to advance the investigation of the Libyan chemical factory incident.

　　因利比亚化工厂事件受到内外压力    
    西德政府搜查涉嫌公司和公司负责人住宅
    新华社波恩１月２５日电（记者胡永震）西德公司参与利比亚化学武器工厂的事件引起舆论的关注，西德政府越来越受到内政外交的压力。
    西德海关侦缉所今天采取大规模行动，对１５家公司以及涉嫌参与这一事件的１２名公司负责人的住宅进行了搜查，其中包括伊姆豪森化学公司、该公司董事长希彭施蒂尔—伊姆豪森的住宅以及该公司的子公司自动化公司。
    据西德奥芬堡检察署宣布，在这次搜查中查获了“大量材料”，有一卡车的文件被没收。西德联邦议院外交委员会今天就利比亚化工厂事件召开特别会议。据透露，政府的一位代表在会上承认，这一事件给西德的对外关系造成了重大损失。
    据反对党社民党议员福伊格特和甘塞尔会后说，可能还有一家公司参与了这一事件。他们批评政府说，对社民党提出的有关利比亚化工厂事件的４９个问题，外长根舍和经济部及财政部的代表一个都没有回答。西德政府面临内外压力，目前一方面大力调查这一事件，另一方面强化法律制裁手段。根舍今天在波恩会见美国世界犹太人大会主席布朗夫曼时说，西德将全力推进有关利比亚化工厂事件的调查工作。
