The nationwide unified entrance examination for adult higher education institutions is approaching, and an official from the State Education Commission's Examination Management Center, responsible for the examination and question design, has advised examinees not to resort to the "flooding with questions" strategy for preparation.

The official stated that over the three years since the implementation of the adult unified examination, both its social impact and the difficulty level of the questions have received positive feedback. Based on an analysis and summary of the overall situation of the adult unified examination, relevant departments have formulated the "Examination Syllabus." He mentioned that the "Examination Syllabus" was drafted with full consideration of the characteristics of adult work and study, focusing on practicality in content selection, which is reflected in the choice of literature for the language test and vocabulary for the foreign language test this year. Additionally, the "Examination Syllabus" has increased the transparency of the proportions of closed-ended questions, question types, and difficulty levels in the test papers. The official said that the guiding principle for question design this year continues to emphasize both the selection of qualified new students for adult higher education institutions and the improvement of the cultural and scientific literacy of the workforce. The difficulty level of the questions will not undergo significant adjustments, aiming to improve quality on a stable basis. Therefore, examinees do not need to speculate on or guess the questions. He stated that the specific requirements for each subject are detailed in the "Examination Syllabus."

    成人高考重实用  题海战术不可取
    新华社北京１月２３日电  今年的全国成人高等学校统一招生考试已临近，负责考试和命题工作的国家教委考试管理中心有关负责人告诫考生，不必为应考去搞“题海战术”。
    这位负责人说，成人统考实行３年来，无论是社会效果，还是试题的难易，总的反映是好的。有关部门在分析和总结成人统考总体情况的基础上制定了《考试大纲》。他说，《考试大纲》制定时充分考虑了成人工作和学习的特点，在内容选择上注意实用，这在今年试题的语文篇目和外语词汇的选择上都有所体现。同时，《考试大纲》还增加了过去封闭性很强的试卷内容比例、题型比例、试题难易比例等内容的透明度。这位负责人说，今年命题的指导思想仍坚持既有利于成人高校选拔合格新生，又有利于提高职工队伍文化、科学素质的精神，试题的难易不作大的调整，力求在稳定的基础上提高质量。因此，考生没有必要押题、猜题。他说，考试各科目的具体要求，《考试大纲》都作出了详尽的规定。
