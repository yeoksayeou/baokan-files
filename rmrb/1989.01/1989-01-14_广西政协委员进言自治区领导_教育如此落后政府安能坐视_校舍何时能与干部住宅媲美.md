	Guangxi CPPCC Members Advise Autonomous Region Leaders: Education Cannot Be Ignored
	Can the Government Remain Indifferent to Such Backward Education?
	When Will School Buildings Be as Good as Official Residences?

	People's Daily, Nanning, January 12th — Reporter Zheng Shengfeng reports: Some CPPCC members from Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region today held a dialogue with the region's party and government leaders, expressing deep concern and anxiety about the pressing issue of education. They unanimously pointed out: We have no time to delay, and we have no right to neglect education.

	It is no wonder that the CPPCC members are worried about education. In many ethnic minority regions of Guangxi, the primary school consolidation rate is as low as below 50%, and only 30% of primary school graduates proceed to junior high school. This means that out of every 100 young people, only 15 can receive nine years of education. A CPPCC member who has long been engaged in education work said that insufficient education funding and dilapidated school buildings have become serious obstacles to the development of ethnic minority regions.

	A member who left home at a young age and came from Hong Kong recalled her recent observations: She visited her hometown in Guangxi and found that the school she attended as a child was still in a state of disrepair, while the homes of local officials were mostly newly built, neat and clean. She sighed and raised a question: "Can the officials make a firm decision to build middle and primary schools as well as their own residences?"

	The party and government leaders present responded to the sincere and pointed questions raised by the CPPCC members with an open mind, providing relatively practical introductions and answers. They said that such dialogues could "improve the democratization and scientific decision-making process."

　　广西政协委员进言自治区领导
    教育如此落后政府安能坐视
    校舍何时能与干部住宅媲美
    本报南宁１月１２日电  记者郑盛丰报道：广西壮族自治区一些政协委员，今天与区党政领导对话，说到颇为严峻的教育问题时充满激动和不安。他们不约而同地指出：对教育工作，我们没有时间拖延，也没有权力忽视了。
    难怪政协委员们对教育表示忧虑。在广西许多民族地区，小学巩固率低到５０％以下，而小学毕业生又只有３０％升入初中。这就是说，每１００名青少年中，只有１５人能接受９年教育。长期从事教育事业的政协委员说，教育经费不足、校舍简陋，已是民族地区发展的严重障碍。
    一位少小离家、来自香港的委员沉痛地提到她的近期见闻：她回探广西老家，看到少时读书的学校仍破旧不堪，而当地领导干部的住房大多是新建的，整齐干净。她不胜感慨地提出一个问题：“父母官”们能否下决心，把中小学校也建设得像他们的住房那样？
    对政协委员们提出的恳切而尖锐的问题，在座的党政领导能够虚心听取，并作了较为切实的介绍和回答。他们称这种对话能够“提高决策民主化和科学化的有益沟通”。
