	When it comes to party supervision, some people shake their heads and say, "It's hard to do!" However, Liu Hanqing, a member of the Standing Committee of the CPC Guizhou Provincial Committee and Secretary of the Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission, smiles and says to the reporter, "Cadre of the Discipline Inspection Commission are specialized in gnawing hard bones. Otherwise, what are we here for?"

	Liu Hanqing, who recently came to Beijing to attend the national discipline inspection work conference, introduced to the reporter the situation of strengthening party supervision in Guizhou. He said that since the second half of last year, the Standing Committee of the Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission, together with comrades from the Provincial Organization Department, attended the democratic life meetings of 8 regional party committees, coordinating and solving some issues related to the unity of the regional party committee leadership. The discipline inspection organs in Guiyang, Bijie, and other places changed the situation where the masses petitioned to the discipline inspection organs visiting the masses, conducting multi-level and multi-angle investigations on the party's style of work, and mobilizing the masses to participate in supervision, obtaining clues to some major issues. With the support of the Provincial Committee, a joint meeting system of leaders of various supervision organs at the provincial level was established, promoting the handling of various cases of disciplinary violations. In order to strengthen the theoretical guidance of party supervision, the Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission also held a symposium on supervision theory at the end of last year.

	When asked about the difficulties faced by party supervision, Comrade Liu Hanqing said, "There are indeed many difficulties. First, many party cadres and leaders do not have a strong awareness of accepting supervision and are unwilling to put themselves in a position to be supervised; second, some principles regarding supervision work are quite vague, and some regulations are detached from the reality of the primary stage, making it difficult for the Discipline Inspection Commission to implement supervision in practice; third, the legitimate rights and interests of supervisors are difficult to guarantee; fourth, the relationships between various supervision organs have not been fully sorted out. Therefore, some discipline inspection cadres are unwilling to do, do not know how to do, or are not daring to do this crucial work of party supervision. These problems need to be gradually solved."

	"To gnaw hard bones, both the discipline inspection organization and the discipline inspection cadres must be strong. If one does not become a model of observing laws and regulations, one cannot be strong, and when encountering 'hard' situations, one will first become weak." Liu Hanqing continued, "Since last year, we have paid attention to strengthening the training of discipline inspection cadres. Because the efficiency and compactness of the discipline inspection organs depend on the high quality of the discipline inspection cadres. At the same time, strengthen the supervision of supervisors. Supervision is equal, and supervisors must be supervised; the basis of supervision has the same binding force on supervisors and the supervised."

	When talking about how to strengthen party supervision, Liu Hanqing especially emphasized the need to fully play the overall effectiveness of the supervision system. He said that due to the attention of Provincial Committee Secretary Liu Zhengwei, Guizhou has initially established horizontal connections and joint meeting systems within the supervision system. Practice has shown that this approach is beneficial for information exchange, policy coordination, unified understanding, and unified steps. The discipline inspection organs should play a coordinating role in the supervision system, but must also pay attention to not turning coordination into taking over, and not interfering with the independent exercise of their own powers by various supervision departments according to law. In playing the overall effectiveness of supervision, public opinion supervision is an indispensable and irreplaceable aspect. The discipline inspection departments should support public opinion supervision from the aspects of organization, system, and work, so that it can better reflect the characteristics of rapid response, wide audience, and large influence.

	Comrade Liu Hanqing finally said, "Party supervision is the supervision of party organizations, party leaders, and the broad masses of party members. The key objects of party supervision are the power holders within the party. Whether the power holders use their power to produce positive or negative effects, they will have a significant impact on social life. Facts have shown that once power is not constrained, it will produce corruption. To eliminate corruption and maintain a clean government, in addition to playing the exemplary role of the broad masses of party members, it is also necessary to strengthen party supervision. The central party's policy of rectification, rectification, and deepening reform has put forward higher requirements for supervision work and also provided a rare opportunity to improve the supervision mechanism. We must seize the opportunity and make further progress in supervision work."

　　纪检干部要有“啃硬骨头”精神    
    ——贵州省纪委书记刘汉桢谈党内监督
    本报记者  舒瑜
    一谈起党内监督，有的人就连连摇头：“难啃啊！”中共贵州省委常委、省纪委书记刘汉桢却笑着对记者说：“纪检干部是专啃硬骨头的。不然，还要我们干什么？”
    近日来京参加全国纪检工作会议的刘汉桢，向记者介绍了贵州加强党内监督的情况。他说，去年下半年以来，省纪委常委与省委组织部的同志一起，分别列席了８个地区党委的民主生活会，协调解决了一些地区党委班子的团结问题。贵阳、毕节等地纪检机关变群众上访为纪检机关下访，多层次、多视角地对党风状况进行考察，并发动群众参与监督，掌握了一些重大问题的线索。在省委支持下，建立了省级各监督机关领导人联席会议制度，推动了各类违纪案件的查处工作。为了加强对党内监督的理论指导，省纪委还于去年底召开了监督理论研讨会。
    当问到党内监督所面临的难题时，刘汉桢同志说：“难题确实很多。一是不少党员领导干部接受监督的意识不强，不愿意把自己摆在被监督的位置上；二是关于监督工作的一些原则比较笼统，有些规定又脱离初级阶段的实际，使纪委在实施监督的实践中难以操作；三是监督者的正当合法权益难以保障；四是各监督机关的关系还没有完全理顺。所以，一些纪检干部对党内监督这一至关重要的工作不愿做、不会做、不敢做。这些问题要逐步予以解决。”
    “要啃硬骨头，纪检组织和纪检干部自身都要硬。不成为遵纪守法的模范，想硬也硬不起来，一碰到‘硬’自己首先就瘫软了。”刘汉桢接着说：“去年以来，我们注意加强对纪检干部的培训。因为纪检机关的高效、精干取决于纪检干部的高素质。同时，加强对监督者的监督。监督是平等的，监督者必须受监督；监督的依据对监督者和被监督者都具有同等的约束力。”
    在谈到如何强化党内监督时，刘汉桢特别强调要充分发挥监督体系的整体效能。他说，由于省委书记刘正威的重视，贵州初步建立了监督体系的横向联系和联席会议制度。实践已经说明，这样做有利于交流信息、协调政策、统一认识、统一步调。纪检机关在监督体系中既要发挥协调作用，又必须注意不要将协调变为包揽，不要干涉各监督部门依法独立行使自己的职权。在发挥监督的整体效能中，舆论监督是不可替代、不可缺少的方面。纪检部门要从组织上、制度上、工作上支持舆论监督，使它更好地体现反应迅速、受众广泛、影响面大等特点。
    刘汉桢同志最后说：“党内监督是对党组织、党员领导干部与广大党员的监督。党内监督的重点对象是党内掌权者。党内掌权者用权时无论发挥正效应或负效应，都会对社会生活产生重大影响。事实说明，权力一旦不受约束，便会产生腐败。要清除腐败现象，廉洁党政机关，除了发挥广大党员的表率作用，还必须强化党内监督。党中央提出的治理、整顿、深化改革的方针既对监督工作提出了更高的要求，也为健全监督机制提供了难得的机遇。我们要抓住机会，在监督工作中再上一层楼。”
