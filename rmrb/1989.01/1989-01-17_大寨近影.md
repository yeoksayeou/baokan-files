Title: A Recent Glimpse of Dazhai

In the era of "Learning from Dazhai," reporters who went to Dazhai for interviews had to submit interview plans and then take photos in an "organized" manner. At that time, Dazhai was a "model," but it had nothing to do with the commodity economy.

In the past decade, fewer reporters have gone to Dazhai. What does Dazhai look like now? Readers might be interested.

Today's Dazhai Village is peaceful and relaxed. Reporters can take photos freely, capturing whatever they want. The living standards of Dazhai people have improved significantly, and their mindset has changed. In 1988, the per capita income was about 700 yuan, an increase of over 500 yuan compared to 1978. Many of the cave dwellings are furnished similarly to urban homes. Every household is living quite well. The village has seen the emergence of individual farmers running transportation services, small shops... Village-run industries are developing step by step. Reforms in Dazhai have borne fruit.

After experiencing political ups and downs, Dazhai people still remember the lessons of the "Leftist" errors and detest the atmosphere of grandiosity and lack of practicality. When I stood on Houtou Mountain and looked at the neatly terraced fields, an elderly person beside me, as if asking me and also asking himself: Nowadays, most young people in Dazhai don't know how to build walls, repair land, or carry loads. Can this work? But the young people are not concerned: No problem. In the past, we didn't understand the commodity economy, but now we have learned some. Opening mountains and clearing land, as long as it is needed, we will learn, and we will learn it quickly.

### 大寨近影

　　大寨近影
    在“学大寨”的年代，到大寨采访的记者需要奉命提交采访计划，然后“有组织”地拍照。那时的大寨虽是“典型”，但与商品经济无缘。
    近十年来，去大寨的记者不像过去那么多了，现在的大寨是什么样儿？读者也许感兴趣。
    今日的大寨村是宁静的、轻松的，记者可以随便拍照片，想拍什么，就拍什么。大寨人的生活有了明显的提高，观念也起了变化。１９８８年人均收入约７００元，比１９７８年增加５００多元。许多窑洞里的陈设同城市差不多。家家户户小日子过得挺红火。村里出现了农民个体的运输户、小商店……村办工业在一步一个脚印地发展。改革在大寨已结出了果实。
    经历了政治上的风风雨雨，大寨人对“左”的教训记忆犹新，对大轰大嗡、不讲实事求是的风气很厌恶。当我登上虎头山眺望那修得整整齐齐的梯田的时候，身旁的一位老人像是问我，也像是问自己：如今大寨的年轻人大都不会垒墙、修地、挑担了，这能行吗？可年轻人却不以为然：没问题。过去咱不懂商品经济，现在也学会了一些。开山劈地，只要需要，就学嘛，一学也就会了。
