Last winter was the largest in scale and most efficient in terms of water conservancy winter repair work in nearly 10 years in China. The earthwork tasks have been basically completed. By the end of December, the country had invested 2.4 billion labor days, completing over 30 billion cubic meters of earth and stone work. Additionally, 40 million mu of irrigation area were newly added, restored, or improved, 13 million mu of waterlogging areas were drained, and 24 million mu of water and soil erosion areas and low-yield fields were treated. Many completed projects have played a significant role in current winter irrigation and drought resistance efforts.

To ensure a bumper harvest this year, the entire Party and governments at all levels have placed great importance on winter agricultural water conservancy construction. They have spared no effort to increase funding and material input. Henan Province has increased its water conservancy funds by 200 million yuan in the past two years. Provinces (autonomous regions) such as Hubei, Guangxi, Hunan, Hebei, Jiangsu, and Guizhou not only increased their investments but also pre-allocated funds to address urgent winter repair needs. Many provincial, municipal, and county leaders have gone to water conservancy construction sites, participated in voluntary labor, and promptly solved emerging problems, further igniting the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses for water conservancy construction. Those who have strength contribute labor, and those who have money contribute funds. According to incomplete statistics from more than 10 provinces (autonomous regions) and municipalities, including Shandong, Guangdong, and Jiangxi, the masses have raised over 500 million yuan for winter repair work. Yantai City in Shandong Province has raised 60 million yuan at various levels to ensure smooth winter repair progress.

During the winter repair of water conservancy projects, relevant departments, industries, and units in various places have provided strong support and active cooperation, such as timely supply of required materials and early completion of project planning and design. The petroleum and building materials departments in Guangxi have given water conservancy projects the "green light," timely supplying thousands of tons of diesel and gasoline. Dalian City, despite the shortage of "three materials" (cement, steel, and timber), has allocated 1,000 tons of cement and hundreds of tons of steel and timber to support water conservancy construction. Some places, considering the significant transfer of rural labor to non-agricultural industries, have actively allocated more machinery for winter repairs. According to incomplete statistics from Shaanxi Province, over 1,000 units of bulldozers, trucks, and excavators have been invested in winter repairs. Nantong City in Jiangsu Province has invested over 200 units of mud pump sets for river dredging, achieving high efficiency, labor savings, and cost reduction.

Currently, the "Three-North" region is frozen, and the earthwork tasks in central and southern regions have also been basically completed. However, the complementary tasks of bridges, culverts, and sluices are still heavy, which is crucial to ensuring that winter repair projects play a greater role in this year's efforts. According to reports from various places, the shortage of "three materials" is a major issue. Although various places are actively raising funds, it is still necessary for leaders and relevant departments at all levels to pay attention to ensure that the labor invested by farmers can play a role and achieve real results in securing a bumper harvest this year.

　　去年水利冬修规模大效益好
    土方任务已基本完成　工程发挥显著作用
    本报讯  记者萧俊熙报道：去冬，是我国近１０年来水利冬修规模最大、效益最好的一年，土方任务已基本完成。到１２月底统计，全国已投入劳动工日２４亿多个，累计完成土石方３０多亿方，新增、恢复和改善灌溉面积４０００多万亩，除涝面积１３００多万亩，还治理水土流失面积和改造低产田２４００多万亩。已完成的许多工程在当前冬灌和抗旱中发挥了显著作用。
    为夺取今年农业丰收，全党和各级政府都把搞好冬季农田水利建设放在极重要的位置，千方百计增加资金和物质投入，河南省近两年新增水利经费２亿元；湖北、广西、湖南、河北、江苏、贵州等省（区）不仅增加了投资，有些省还提前预拨经费，解决冬修急需。许多省、地、县的领导深入水利工地，带头参加义务劳动，及时解决出现的问题，进一步激发了广大干部和群众修水利的热情，有力的出力，有钱的出钱。据山东、广东、江西等１０多个省（区）、市的不完全统计，群众自筹冬修资金５亿多元。山东省烟台市各级筹资６０００万元，保证了冬修顺利进行。
    在冬修水利中，各地有关部门、行业和单位也给予了大力支持和积极配合，如及时供应所需物料，及早做出工程规划、设计等。广西的石油和建材部门为水利开“绿灯”，及时供应数千吨柴油、汽油。大连市在“三材”紧缺的情况下，仍拨出１０００吨水泥和数百吨钢材和木材支持水利建设。一些地方根据农村劳力转入非农产业较多的情况，积极调配更多机械投入冬修。据陕西省的不完全统计，投入冬修的推土机、汽车、铲运机等１０００多台（辆）。江苏省南通市投入２００多台泥浆泵机组进行河道清淤，取得了高效省工节支的效益。
    目前，“三北”地区大地封冻，中、南部地区的水利土方任务也已基本完成，但桥、涵、闸等建筑物配套任务还重，这是能否保证冬修工程在今年发挥更大效益的关键。据各地反映，“三材”紧缺是大问题，各地虽已在积极筹措，但仍需各级领导和有关部门给予关注，务使农民已投入的劳动在夺取今年农业丰收中起作用、见实效。
