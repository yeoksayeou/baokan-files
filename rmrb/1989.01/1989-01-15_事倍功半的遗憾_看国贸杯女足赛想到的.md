The women's football invitational tournament sponsored by the China International Trade and Trust Corporation of Xiamen has successfully concluded its three rounds of matches. However, as the first multi-national football tournament held in Xiamen, the organizers feel that something is still missing, and the reporters who covered the event also feel that there isn't much news worth writing about. The main problem is that the level of competition was not high, and the appeal was not strong.

As early as a year ago, the Chinese Football Association proposed to organize this event. The China International Trade and Trust Corporation of Xiamen expressed its willingness to sponsor the event. The Chinese Football Association had previously invited women's football teams from seven or eight countries and regions, but high-level teams from countries like the United States, Italy, and West Germany declined with various excuses. Teams from Indonesia and Hong Kong also failed to participate due to procedural or financial difficulties. Thus, what was originally planned as a high-level international invitational tournament turned out to be the current situation.

It is said that a responsible person from the Chinese Football Association once stated that the invitational tournament does not seek a large scale, and having three high-level teams participate would be sufficient to hold the tournament. However, in reality, the Philippine national champion team, the Makati Club, had to borrow a coach and five players from the Fujian team to make up the numbers. The host team hoped to have their own team perform in front of their hometown audience, which is understandable, but the Xiamen women's football team is actually an amateur sports school-level team. They had to hastily assemble and rely on five players from the national training team to assist in the match to get things started. The quality and level of such a team's performance can be imagined.

The Finnish team, which traveled a long distance, arrived in Beijing on January 7, but encountered flight delays and was stranded for two days, not arriving in Xiamen until nearly midnight on the 9th. People were once concerned that this sole high-level Nordic team would not be able to complete the match scheduled for the next day. Fortunately, the visiting team had a good training foundation, rested for a few hours, and then went to practice. By noon on the 10th, they took to the field to compete, and their opponents were so weak that they were easily defeated, which finally relieved people's worries.

Currently, women's football is on the rise but has not yet established its position through formal world championships. In countries where professional football is prevalent, such as in Europe and America, women's football lacks a sound management structure and finds it difficult to obtain financial support from the business community. Most players are students who often have to change their training and competition schedules due to personnel and financial difficulties, and long-distance competitions are far from easy. Under these circumstances, organizing international competitions is indeed fraught with difficulties. China's women's football level is not low, and it is the host country for the upcoming first Women's World Cup. The Chinese team now needs to broaden its horizons, increase contact with world-class teams, enrich its competition experience, and understand the development trends of women's football around the world. Holding international invitational tournaments is obviously an important way to achieve this. How to strive for twice the result with half the effort and achieve benefits remains to be summarized.

### 事倍功半的遗憾——看国贸杯女足赛想到的

　　事倍功半的遗憾
    ——看国贸杯女足赛想到的
    筹备多日的国贸杯女子足球邀请赛已经顺利踢完了三轮。但是，作为厦门市第一次举办的多边国际足球赛，主办者感到似乎还缺点什么，到场采访的记者们也觉得没有很多值得写的新闻。主要问题是比赛水平不高，吸引力不强。
    早在一年前，中国足协便有了筹办这桩赛事的动议，厦门国际贸易信托公司表示，乐意解囊成全好事。中国足协曾先后向七八个国家和地区的女子足球队发出邀请，但美国、意大利和西德等水平较高的国家借种种托辞回绝，印尼和香港等队也因手续或经费方面的困难未能成行。于是，一次拟议中的高水平国际邀请赛，便成了现在这样的局面。
    据说，中国足协一位负责人曾表示，邀请赛不求规模大，有３支高水平的队伍应邀，就能成赛。可实际上，菲律宾全国冠军马基沓俱乐部队要借福建队一名教练和５名球员充数才够人手。东道主希望有自己的球队在家乡父老面前献技，心情可以理解，但厦门女足实为业余体校级别的队伍，临时拼凑，需国家集训队支援５人客串助战，才能打开锣鼓。这样的球队上阵，比赛质量和水平可想而知。
    远道而来的芬兰队１月７日飞到北京，碰上航班延误，被困了两天，直至９日深夜近１２点才到厦门。人们一度担心这唯一一支高水平的北欧劲旅难以完成第二天就要进行的比赛。好在客队训练基础极好，歇了几个小时就去练球，１０日中午便登场作赛，而对手又是那样不堪一击，这才让人松了口气。
    目前，女子足球运动方兴未艾，却还不曾通过正式世界大赛确立自己的地位。在职业足球盛行的欧美各国，女子足球没有健全的管理机构，不容易得到财界的资助。球员多为学生，时常会因人员及经费方面的困窘变更训练和比赛安排，远足征战更非轻而易举之事。在这种情况下举办国际比赛，确实难处不少。中国女子足球运动水平不低，又是未来第一届世界女足锦标赛的举办国。中国队现在很需要扩大眼界，增加与世界强队的接触，丰富比赛经验，了解世界女足发展动向。举办国际邀请赛，显然是一条重要途径。如何争取事半功倍，取得收益，看来得总结点东西。
