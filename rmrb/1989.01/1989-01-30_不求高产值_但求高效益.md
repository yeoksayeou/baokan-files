For many years, numerous enterprises have focused heavily on increasing production and output, but most have not escaped the "high speed, low efficiency" trap. The Nanjing Steel Rolling Mill, however, has not pursued high output but has instead sought high efficiency. This approach has resulted in a situation where the growth in output is significantly lower than the national average, yet the growth in efficiency is at the top of the list among similar enterprises nationwide.

For enterprises to achieve good economic benefits, they must focus on deepening reforms, adjusting product structures, and improving technological levels. Maintaining old product structures and using outdated equipment to produce obsolete products will not yield high efficiency, no matter how much effort is put in.

"Potential has been fully exploited." This is the lament of some enterprises when discussing economic benefits. This requires specific analysis. Some calculations show that the energy consumed to produce each billion dollars of gross national product in China is 6.1 times that of Japan, 2.3 times that of the United States, and 1.7 times that of the Soviet Union. The economic benefits of various provinces and cities within the country also vary greatly. According to statistics, in 1988, the labor productivity of some regions differed by nearly three times. Clearly, in terms of improving economic benefits, enterprises are not without potential; rather, they have significant potential. As long as they persist, the goal of improving economic benefits can certainly be achieved.

　　不求高产值　但求高效益
    路华
    多年来，不少企业在上产量、求产值上花了大力气，但大多没有走出“高速低效”的怪圈。南京轧钢厂不求高产值，但求高效益，出现了产值增长大大低于全国平均速度，效益增长却居全国同行业榜首的新气象。
    企业要获得良好的经济效益，就应在深化改革、调整产品结构和提高技术水平上下功夫。维持老的产品结构，用陈旧的设备生产过时的产品，花的力量再大，效益也不会高。
    “潜力已挖尽。”这是一些企业在谈论经济效益时的感叹。对此要作具体分析。有人测算，我国创造每亿美元国民生产总值所消耗的能源，相当于日本的６．１倍，美国的２．３倍，苏联的１．７倍。国内各个省市经济效益也相差悬殊。据统计，１９８８年部分地区工业全员劳动生产率相差近３倍。可见，在提高经济效益上，企业不是没有潜力，而是潜力不小。只要锲而不舍，提高经济效益的愿望，是完全可以实现的。
