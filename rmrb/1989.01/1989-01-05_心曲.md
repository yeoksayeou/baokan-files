The Heart's Melody

Yè Yán Bīn

I woke up to find myself standing naked in the countryside, no, standing tall on the road. I wanted to shout, but no sound came out; I struggled, but I couldn't move. I had turned into a stone archway! Had I had a nightmare before falling asleep? It didn't seem like it. The sun was scorching me, and a few pigeons were cooing above my head, flirting. Right, this was the scene from my poem "The Chastity of the Archway." Oh no, my poem had been disrespectful to the archway, and now I was paying the price. Karma! Aren't archways built for women? I'm a real man! I looked at myself and immediately felt dejected, acknowledging that my judgment of my own gender was outdated. I was just a pile of stones, a real pile of stones. And these stones were carved quite well! Forget it, this isn't the time for self-admiration. I need to think of a way to let my family know. Oh, my wife must think I'm on a business trip, but she should have noticed that my train ticket is still on the table... After calming down, someone came by. "Hey! I'm Yè Yán Bīn!" Whether he was deaf or I was mute, this gentleman silently walked under my "crotch."

A miracle happened! Although I had turned into an archway, I gained a "special ability"—I could hear the thoughts of everyone who passed under the archway. This led me into a state of self-forgetfulness as I busied myself recording these heartfelt thoughts. Well, I might as well be a "archway-type recorder" for a while!

"Damn traditions! This is Eastern civilization! Presenting intangible etiquette with stone, oppressing people so they can't breathe. Using the dead to oppress the living, using stone to oppress the heart, I just don't understand why Chinese people don't know how to live a little easier..." It seemed this gentleman was venting his anger at "tradition" on me.

"Excellent! This is true abstract art. A door without walls, the shape of a door without the obstruction of a door panel, merging with the heavens and earth, borrowing the spirit of mountains and water, the stone gains a spirit! Abstract yet not separate from nature, constructed with mountains and water, a landscape with philosophical consciousness. The culmination of Chinese culture, the archway too!" It seemed this was a modern artist, he was praising me too much, I felt embarrassed.

"Times have changed, times have changed! Such a big archway, and these little vixens can't even see it? Divorces, remarriages, getting married while pregnant, you can't count them. Archway, you stand here in vain!" Looking at the old woman's pointed shoes, I really wanted to laugh. Old lady, I don't want to stand here either!

"The tourism bureau wants to make money off this archway, but the higher-ups give us the trouble of finding a famous owner for it! Heaven help us, this land hasn't produced a Meng Jiangnü, Qin Xianglian, Su San, or a Zhuo Yun of the red actresses. No way out, today I'll go to the cultural center to ask a few brothers to look up the local gazetteer, find a hanging or drowning chaste woman, and weave a moving legend to get it over with!" What bad luck! When I was a poet, people weaving anecdotes about me made me laugh and cry, and now as an archway, I'm still being practiced...

"What the heck! A few rotten stones stuck in the road, and the bosses treat them like treasures, causing traffic jams and accidents every day, they're going to smash my traffic supervisor's bowl of rice! Damn it, four modernizations, four modernizations, but can't deal with a few roadblocks..." I sympathized with this man in a cap, but alas, I am a lifelong position, no retirement age, the older I get, the better I feel, I have to stand my last watch.

"OK! How beautiful! Very good! I love you!" This foreign gentleman was completely charmed by me, he said he was a member of the editorial committee of the "World Famous Architecture Art Encyclopedia." Being chosen by him is very unfavorable to me, once I'm in the "Encyclopedia," my identity as an archway will be impossible to change. Blessing or curse?

"This stone carving technique is not bad. Right, establish a 'Chinese Ancient Archway Carving Art Research Center,' set up a foundation, attract hundreds of millions of yuan in sponsorship, this is a new way to 'activate' things!" I really wanted to spit on this bald head, oh no, I've developed an archway consciousness!

"Yè Yán Bīn, where did that guy go?! His train ticket is still on the table, but where is he?! Is he mad at me? No way! Next time if he teases me like this, I'll starve him for a day, not cook for him! Is he hit by a car? Yè Yán Bīn..." Seeing my wife shed tears, I saw her pitiful appearance, my heart felt sour... Hey! I was me again: a 1.76-meter-tall man standing behind my wife.

Later, the couple had an argument and discussion about this matter. Finally, she believed my explanation, that I was standing here, and the stone archway was gone.

My kind wife was worried about those who confided in the stone archway, facing the reality of no archway, whether they could psychologically bear it, and advised me to write this short article to account for the archway problem.

　　心曲
    叶延滨
    一觉醒来，发现我赤条条地站在郊外的路上，不，是矗在路上。要喊，喊不出声；挣扎，动弹不了。我变成了一座石牌坊！莫不是睡觉前做噩梦？不像，太阳火辣辣地烙着我，几只鸽子在我头上咕咕地调情。对了，这是我那首诗《牌坊的贞节》中的情形。糟了，我那首诗对牌坊的种种大不恭敬，今日让我自己受用了。报应！牌坊不是为女人树的吗？我是货真价实的男人哪！我打量了一下“自己”，马上沮丧地承认，我对自己性别的判断已经过时，我只是一堆石头，一堆货真价实的石头而已。这些石头还雕刻得真不错！算了，现在不是自我欣赏的时候，得想点招儿，让家里人知道。哎呀，我的妻子准以为我出差了，不过她应当发现我的车票还在桌子上……等定定神，有人过来了，“喂！我是叶延滨！”不知是他聋了还是我哑了，这位先生默默地从我“胯下”走过。
    奇迹出现了！我变成了牌坊却得到一种“特异功能”——能听见每个走过牌坊的人心里的话，这使我进入一种忘我境界，忙着记下这些心曲。好吧，当一回“牌坊型录音机”吧！
    “可恶的传统！这就是东方文明！把无形的礼教用石头来呈现，压得人喘不过气。用死人压活人，用石头压人心，真不懂中国人为什么不知道活得轻松一点……”看来这位先生对“传统”的气出在我身上了。
    “棒极了！这才是真正的抽象艺术。有门却没有墙，有门之形却没有阻挡的门板，与天地合一，借山水的灵秀，石头也得一种精神！抽象却不离开自然，与山水同构，风景却有哲学意识。中国文化集大成者，牌坊也！”看来这是位现代派艺术家，他太夸奖我了，真不好意思。
    “人心不古，人心不古！这么大的牌坊现在这些小妖精就看不见？离婚的离婚，改嫁的改嫁，怀着崽儿才去扯结婚证的数也数不清。牌坊哟，你枉自站在这儿！”看着这九斤老太的尖尖脚我真想笑。老太太，我才不想站在这里呢！
    “旅游局想用这牌坊赚钱，上头却把难题出给我们文物管理所，要求给牌坊找个有知名度的主人！老天爷，咱这方水土又没养出个孟姜女、秦香莲、苏三、莺莺之类的红角儿。没法子的事，今天到文化馆去求哥几个查查地方志，找出个上吊跳河的贞女节妇编他一个动人心魄的传说，交差！”倒霉透顶的事！我当诗人那阵子就让人编轶事弄得哭笑不得，当牌坊还要被人继续操练……
    “什么玩意！几块烂石头往路上一戳，头头们就当宝贝护着，天天堵车，交通事故不断，非把我这交通监理所长的饭碗砸了不可！娘的，四化四化，就拿几个拦路石没办法……”我很同情这个戴大盖帽的，怎奈我乃终身制，没退休年限，越老自我感觉越良好，要站完最后一班岗嘛。
　　“ＯＫ！　Ｈｏｗ　ｂｅａｕｔｉｆｕｌ！　Ｖｅｒｙ　ｇｏｏｄ！
　Ｉ　ｌｏｖｅ　ｙｏｕ！”这个洋先生简直被我迷住了，据说他是个什么“世界著名建筑艺术大全”编辑委员会的委员。被他相中，这对我十分不利， 一旦入了“大全”，我这牌坊的身份就无法改变了。福兮祸兮？
   “这几块石头的雕刻技术不错。对了，搞一个‘中国古代牌坊雕刻艺术研究中心’，建个基金会，拉上几百万元赞助，这倒是‘搞活’的新路子！”我真想唾这秃头一口，糟了，我怎么有了牌坊意识啦？
    “叶延滨这家伙上哪儿去了？！他的车票还在桌上，人在哪儿？！生我的气啦？不会的！下次这么捉弄我，非饿他一天，不给他做饭！是不是让车撞了？延滨！……”妻子那么一掉眼泪，我看见了她那让人怜爱的样子，心里酸溜溜的……嘿！我又是我了：一米七六的男人站在我妻子背后。
    随后是两口子的关于这事的争吵和议论。最后总算让她相信了我的解释，是我站在这里，而那座牌坊不见了。
    好心的妻子担心那些向石牌坊吐露心曲的人，面对没有牌坊的现实，能否有足够的心理承受能力，劝我写下这篇短文，好使牌坊问题有个交代。
