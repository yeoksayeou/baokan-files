On the evening of November 25, 1988, we arrived in Shenyang. After exiting the train station, a young woman approached us and offered to guide us to a hotel. She led us to a small car. After driving for a few minutes, the car stopped about 100 meters away from a hotel. The driver and another young man demanded 30 yuan for the ride, saying, "No money, no getting off the car." Since it was our first time in Shenyang and we were unfamiliar with the area, we had no choice but to hand over 30 yuan. The car's license plate number was Liao Ning 01-23000 (a red taxi).

　　沈阳也有“剪径客”
    １９８８年１１月２５日晚上９时，我们到达沈阳。出火车站后，一个姑娘主动向我们介绍旅馆。她领我们坐上一辆小汽车。车开了没几分钟，便在距一家旅社１００多米处停下了。司机和另外一男青年让我们交３０元车费，还说“不交钱就别想下车。”我们第一次到沈阳，人生地不熟，只好拿出３０元钱给他们。这辆车的车号：辽宁０１—２３０００号（红色出租小车）。
