Yuan Mu Discusses the Economic Situation and Rectification Efforts of Last Year

Achievements: The economy continued to grow, with the national gross product reaching over 13,600 billion yuan
Problems: Economic overheating, with the retail price index rising by 18.5%

According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 13th - Today, at a press conference held by the Chinese Journalists Association, Yuan Mu, spokesperson for the State Council, revealed that in 1988, China's economy continued to develop, with the national gross product reaching over 13,600 billion yuan, an 11.2% increase from 1987; national income grew by 11.4%; and the total retail sales of commodities increased by 28%. The main problems in economic development are economic overheating and inflation. The industrial growth rate remains as high as 17.7%, and the annual retail price index rose by 18.5%.

He said that since the end of the Third Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the rectification and adjustment work has achieved initial results, mainly reflected in the following aspects:

- The trend of rapid price increases has begun to slow down slightly. Starting from November to December, the price increase rate decreased by 0.3% and 0.8% respectively compared to the previous month, showing a slight downward trend in the increase rate. Although the general public is still very dissatisfied with the price increases, the sense of tension has somewhat eased.

- Savings deposits have gradually increased. Although urban and rural residents' savings deposits decreased by 2.614 billion yuan in August last year, they began to increase starting from September, reaching 11.238 billion yuan by December. By the end of the year, urban and rural savings deposits totaled 379.8 billion yuan, an increase of 72.46 billion yuan from 1987.

- Investment scale has been controlled. By the end of November last year, a total of 10,200 fixed asset investment projects had been suspended or delayed, with investments reduced by 33.4 billion yuan.

- Significant efforts have been made to control the rapid growth of consumption funds, with the growth rate of social purchasing power beginning to decline. The growth rate in September was 3.9 percentage points lower than in August, in October it was 4.5 percentage points lower than in September, and in November it was 6.8 percentage points lower than in October.

- Tax, financial, and price inspections have achieved certain results. By the end of November last year, a total of 7.9 billion yuan in various violations had been uncovered nationwide, of which 4.4 billion yuan should be remitted to the treasury, and 2.4 billion yuan had already been deposited.

- The cleanup and rectification of companies have been fully launched. Among the more than 600 companies managed by various departments of the State Council, over 200 cases of various violations and illegal activities have been preliminarily identified, and further investigations and handling are currently underway. More than 150 party and government officials who hold concurrent positions in various companies have resigned from one of their positions. More than 30 companies that have not registered and are engaged in illegal business operations will be shut down by the State Administration for Industry and Commerce.

　　袁木谈去年经济及整治情况
    成绩：经济持续增长，国民生产总值达１３６００多亿元
    问题：经济过热，零售物价指数上升１８．５％
    据新华社北京１月１３日电  国务院发言人袁木今天在中国记协举行的记者招待会上透露：１９８８年我国经济持续发展，国民生产总值达到１３６００多亿元，比１９８７年增长１１．２％；国民收入增长１１．４％；社会零售商品总额增长２８％。经济发展中的主要问题，是经济过热，通货膨胀。工业增长速度仍高达１７．７％，全年零售物价指数上升１８．５％。
    他说，中共十三届三中全会结束后的三个半月来，治理整顿工作已取得初步效果，主要表现在以下几个方面：
    ——物价上涨过猛的趋势开始略有减缓。从１１月开始到１２月，物价上涨幅度分别比上月下降了０．３％、０．８％，呈现出上涨幅度略有下降的趋势。尽管广大群众对物价上涨仍然很不满意，但紧张心理稍有缓和。
    ——储蓄存款逐步回升。虽然，去年８月份城乡居民储蓄存款减少２６．１４亿元，但从９月份开始逐步增加，到１２月，已增加１１２．３８亿元。年末城乡储蓄存款已达３７９８亿，比１９８７年增加７２４．６亿。
    ——投资规模有所控制。截至去年１１月底，全国已停建、缓建固定资产投资项目１０２００个，压缩投资３３４亿元。
    ——在控制消费基金过快增长方面做了不少工作，社会集团购买力增长幅度开始下降，９月比８月下降３．９个百分点，１０月比９月下降４．５个百分点，１１月又比１０月下降６．８个百分点。
    ——税收、财务、物价大检查取得一定成效。截至去年１１月底，全国查出各种违纪金额７９亿元，其中应上缴财政的４４亿元，已经入库２４亿元。
    ——清理整顿公司工作全面展开。在国务院各部门管理的６００多个公司中，已初步查出各类违纪、违法问题２００多件，目前正在进一步调查处理。在各种公司中兼职的党政机关现职干部已有１５０多名辞去一方职务。３０多家未曾注册而从事违法经营的公司，将由国家工商管理局宣布取缔。
