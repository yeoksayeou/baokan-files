Prosecutorial organs across the country have made it a key task to investigate and prosecute cases involving the infringement of citizens' democratic rights and dereliction of duty by state officials, as part of efforts to build a democratic political system and maintain the integrity of party and government agencies. From January to November last year, they initiated investigations into 11,300 cases of disciplinary violations.

A senior official from the Law and Discipline Inspection Department of the Supreme People's Procuratorate revealed today that among the more than 10,000 cases investigated, there were 1,613 cases of dereliction of duty, 2,908 cases of major responsibility accidents, 4,454 cases of serious infringements on citizens' democratic rights, such as false accusations, torture, illegal detention, and illegal entry into private residences. There were also several cases of favoritism, releasing criminals, and leaking state secrets.

According to the procuratorial organs, among the cases investigated, 50 involved county-level or higher state officials, 2,681 involved ordinary state officials, 1,257 involved collective economic organization officials, and 8,781 involved other individuals.

Facing the challenge that most defendants in disciplinary cases are state officials, making investigation and handling difficult, procuratorial organs at all levels across the country have adhered to the principle of facts-based and law-abiding prosecution, ensuring impartiality and strict enforcement of the law. They have investigated and prosecuted a number of major cases. By the end of November last year, procuratorial organs nationwide had handled 1,153 major cases and 211 extremely serious cases.

In the investigation of the highly publicized Da Xing'anling fire accident, the procuratorial organs, in addition to approving the arrest and prosecution of four arsonists including Wang Yufeng, also uncovered the dereliction of duty crimes committed by seven individuals, including the former director of the Tuqiang Forestry Bureau of the original Da Xing'anling Forestry Administration, Zhuang Xueyi, and the former deputy secretary of the Mohe County Committee, Li Yongqing. They were held legally accountable.

Former police officer Wang Xiujiang of the Public Security Bureau's Public Security Division in Hengyang City, in collusion with others, used forged materials and private letters of introduction to release 36 criminals who had fled to Guangzhou to commit crimes on nine occasions. Wang received bribes totaling over 6,600 yuan. In February last year, Wang Xiujiang was prosecuted by the procuratorial organ for the crime of favoritism and was later sentenced to 10 years in prison.
