Focus on arable land, increase input, add farm machinery: Zhao County's grain production reaches a new level in one year

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shijiazhuang, January 4th - Zhao County in Hebei Province, designated as a national grain production base, has implemented effective measures such as focusing on arable land, increasing input, and adding farm machinery to develop agricultural production. The county's grain production has reached a new level, with a total grain output of 3.725 billion kilograms in 1988, setting a historical record.

Zhao County is a major grain-producing county in the central plains of Hebei. Each year, it delivers more than 500 million kilograms of commercial grain to the state. To ensure steady grain growth, Zhao County has implemented measures to focus on arable land, increase input, and add farm machinery, with good results.

In terms of arable land, the county has abandoned the past practice of formalism in agricultural water conservancy construction, focusing instead on improving soil fertility. The county has mobilized the masses to extensively implement the practice of returning crop straw to the field, with 210,000 mu in 1987 and 220,000 mu in 1988. In the 1970s, the organic matter content of the county's arable land was only 0.8%, now it has increased to 1.2% to 1.4%, and the content of available nitrogen and phosphorus has also increased accordingly.

The county government at all levels often educate farmers to pay attention to increasing input in agriculture. In 1988, farmers in the county invested more than 170 million yuan in purchasing agricultural machinery and drilling wells. Zhao County is famous for its snow pears, with an annual fruit income of over 200 million yuan. To "supplement agriculture with fruit," they established rural credit cooperatives in the pear-growing areas to absorb funds from pear farmers for agricultural development. This year, the eight pear-growing areas in the county invested more than 11 million yuan in "supplementing agriculture with fruit." The county has also made significant achievements in the development of agricultural mechanization. Currently, the total power of various types of agricultural machinery in the county reaches 602,000 horsepower, ranking first in the province, and plowing, tilling, sowing, harvesting, threshing, and crushing have all been mechanized.

Due to the implementation of these effective measures, Zhao County is becoming the "granary" of the central plains of Hebei. In 1980, the county's grain output was only 2.25 billion kilograms. Since then, grain production has reached a new level each year. In 1988, the county had a bumper grain harvest, delivering 750 million kilograms of grain, making it one of the four counties in Hebei Province that deliver over 100 million kilograms of grain.

　　抓耕地　多投入　添农机
    赵县粮食一年上一个新台阶
    据新华社石家庄１月４日电  （记者彭占魁）被确定为国家粮食生产基地的河北省赵县，采取抓耕地、抓投入、抓农机等各项有力措施发展农业生产。全县粮食一年上一个新台阶，１９８８年粮食总产达３．７２５亿公斤，创造历史最高纪录。
    赵县是冀中平原上的产粮大县，每年向国家交售商品粮０．５亿多公斤。为保证粮食稳步增长，赵县采取抓耕地、抓投入、抓农机等项措施，效果较好。
    在耕地上，这个县摒弃过去农田水利建设搞形式主义的做法，重点提高土地肥力，发动群众大搞秸秆还田，１９８７年秸秆还田２１万亩，１９８８年增加到２２万亩。７０年代这个县耕地的有机质含量仅有０．８％，现在提高到１．２％至１．４％，速效氮和磷的含量也相应增加。
    赵县各级政府经常教育农民注意对农业增加投入。１９８８年，全县农民购买农机、打井等共投入１．７亿多元。赵县是著名的雪花梨之乡，每年梨果收入达两亿多元。为了“以果补农”，他们在梨区成立了民间信用社，吸收梨农资金用于发展农业，全县８个梨区今年投入“以果补农”的资金达１１００多万元。这个县在发展农业机械化上也取得了显著效果。目前，全县各种农业机械的总动力达６０．２万马力，居全省第一位，耕地、选耕、播种、收割、脱粒、粉碎等全部实现了机械化。
    由于采取了有力措施，赵县正在成为冀中平原上的“粮仓”。１９８０年这个县粮食产量只有２．２５亿公斤，以后粮食一年上一个新台阶。１９８８年全县粮食获得丰收，交售粮食０．７５亿公斤，是河北省４个交售亿斤粮的县之一。
