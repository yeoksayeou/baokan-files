The Governor of the People's Bank Proposes New Requirements for Financial Work
Currency Issuance This Year Significantly Lower Than Last Year
Adjust Credit Structure, Increase Effective Supply, Prevent Economic Stagnation

BEIJING, Jan. 12 (Xinhua) -- Vice Premier and Governor of the People's Bank of China, Li Guixian, pointed out that the overall requirement for financial work in 1989 is to tighten monetary policy, stabilize finance, rectify financial order, deepen financial reform, and strive to adjust the credit structure. The goal is to control the total amount while increasing effective supply, prevent economic stagnation, and ensure that this year's currency issuance is significantly lower than last year.

On January 12, the People's Bank of China held a national meeting of branch managers in Beijing. Li Guixian reviewed the financial work of 1988 at the meeting. While acknowledging the achievements, he summarized the lessons learned from last year, mainly that the changes in the economic and financial situation were underestimated, and the tightening of monetary policy was somewhat delayed. At the same time, financial institutions lacked self-discipline mechanisms, and specialized banks did not effectively combine profit targets with macro-control. Some banks pursued profits one-sidedly, borrowed too much money, and overloaded loan issuance. In some places, there was even a situation where agricultural and sideline products were purchased with IOUs. Li Guixian said that the People's Bank should timely summarize the experiences from these problems in financial work.

This year, based on the major economic indicators of the national economy that have been determined, the national financial system has set the policy for currency and credit as: controlling the total amount, adjusting the structure, ensuring key areas, reducing general areas, and timely adjustment. To implement this policy, Li Guixian proposed the following necessary policy measures:

- Strictly control the total amount of currency and credit, clearly define the responsibilities of each bank and each region, and hold those who exceed the limits accountable. A social credit plan should be compiled to include all credit activities of financial institutions and various forms of bonds, stocks, and fundraising, and to supervise and manage them.

- Strengthen credit structure adjustment and improve the efficiency of fund use. Each bank should classify and rank enterprises and products based on the principle of supporting the strong and limiting the weak, and use this as the basis for loan issuance.

- Strengthen the macro-control function of the central bank. In the future, the People's Bank of China should better use economic levers, such as implementing differential interest rates, conducting value-preserving savings, and increasing the reserve ratio, to strengthen the control over the entire financial sector. Special management should be implemented for the funds for purchasing agricultural and sideline products, which should be arranged and guaranteed by each specialized bank.

- Strictly prohibit enterprises from raising funds to expand the scale of fixed asset investment. The amount, interest rate, term, and purpose of enterprise fundraising must all be approved by the People's Bank. At the same time, management methods for stock issuance and trading should be formulated, and stock issuance should be piloted in approved regions.

- Strengthen the management of foreign exchange and foreign debt. Support the adjustment of export commodity structure in foreign trade, promote stable growth of exports, and strive to achieve basic balance in foreign exchange receipts and payments.

　　人民银行行长提出金融工作新要求
    今年货币发行明显低于去年
    调整信贷结构　增加有效供给　防止经济滞胀
    本报讯  记者董焕亮、梅洪如报道：国务委员、中国人民银行行长李贵鲜指出，１９８９年金融工作总的要求是，紧缩银根，稳定金融，整顿金融秩序，深化金融改革，努力调整信贷结构，做到既在总量上控制住，又增加有效供给，防止经济滞胀，使今年的货币发行明显低于去年。
    １月１２日，中国人民银行在北京召开全国分行长会议。李贵鲜在会上回顾了１９８８年的金融工作，在肯定成绩的同时，总结了去年的经验教训，主要是对经济、金融形势的变化估计不足，紧缩银根抓得稍晚。同时，金融机构缺乏自我约束的机制，专业银行没有把利润指标同宏观控制很好结合起来。一些银行片面追求利润，过多地拆入资金，超负荷发放贷款，有的地方甚至一度出现收购农副产品打白条的情况。李贵鲜说，对于金融工作出现的这些问题，人民银行总行应及时总结经验。
    今年，根据已定的国民经济主要经济指标，全国金融系统确定贷币、信贷的方针是：控制总量，调整结构，保证重点，压缩一般，适时调节。实施这一方针，李贵鲜提出要采取必要的政策措施：
    ——严格控制货币信贷总量，明确各家银行和各地区银行的责任，谁突破谁负责。要编制全社会信用规划，把各金融机构的信用活动和各种形式的债券、股票、集资等全部纳入规划，进行监督管理。
    ——强化信贷结构调节，提高资金使用效益。各家银行要根据扶优限劣的原则，对企业和产品进行分类排队，作为发放贷款的依据。
    ——强化中央银行的宏观调控职能。今后中国人民银行要更好地利用经济杠杆，如实行差别利率、开展保值储蓄，提高准备金比例等措施来强化对整个金融的调控。对农副产品收购资金实行专项管理，由各专业银行统筹安排，予以保证。
    ——严禁企业集资扩大固定资产投资规模，企业集资的数额、利率、期限和用途等，都必须经过人民银行批准。同时，要制定股票发行和交易的管理办法，在经过批准的地区试行发行股票。
    ——加强外汇、外债管理。要支持外贸调整出口商品结构，促进出口稳定增长，力争外汇收支基本平衡。
