The United Nations International Narcotics Control Board on January 13 released its 1988 annual report in Vienna, stating that the current global abuse of various narcotics remains very serious, with an increasing number of countries facing illegal production and manufacturing of narcotics. Criminal groups involved in illegal drug trafficking often collaborate with terrorist organizations, spreading violence and corruption, threatening political institutions, disrupting the normal functioning of national economies, and endangering national security. The report believes that this serious situation has drawn high attention from the international community.

The report states that in August 1988, 30 countries in the Americas and Western Europe conducted a coordinated law enforcement operation against drugs. In 30 days, 11 tons of cocaine were seized, 13 cocaine laboratories were destroyed, and 240 tons of marijuana were confiscated. Additionally, 1,000 people were arrested. Furthermore, various countries have taken numerous measures to effectively eradicate the illegal cultivation of narcotic plants. Meanwhile, in the past 18 months, countries have effectively controlled the medical and scientific use of narcotics, preventing 14 tons of psychotropic substances, equivalent to 1.9 billion pills, from entering illegal channels.

The report notes that despite these efforts, the situation of illegal drug abuse remains alarming. In particular, the relationship between the intravenous injection of narcotics and AIDS is causing serious concern. In Europe and America, more than 50% of the reported cases are related to intravenous drug use.

The report concludes by emphasizing the need for further strengthening international cooperation, strictly controlling psychotropic substances, and taking measures to eradicate the illegal production, abuse, and trafficking of drugs, ensuring the health of individuals and social stability.

　　世界滥用麻醉品贻害严重
　　国际社会对此深表不安和关注
    新华社维也纳电  （记者肖力）联合国国际麻醉品管制局１月１３日在这里公布的１９８８年度报告指出，当前世界范围内滥用各种麻醉品的现象仍然十分严重，越来越多的国家出现非法生产和制造麻醉品的情况。从事毒品非法贩运的犯罪集团往往与恐怖主义集团合作，扩散暴力和腐败，威胁政治机构、破坏国民经济的正常运转和危及各国安全。报告认为，这一严重局势已经引起国际社会的高度关注。
    报告说，１９８８年８月，美洲和西欧的３０个国家进行一次有计划的区域间协调执法禁毒活动。在３０天内，缉获１１吨可卡因，摧毁１３个可卡因实验室并销毁了２４０吨大麻，逮捕了１０００人。此外，各国还采取大量措施有效地根除非法种植麻醉药品植物，同时，在有效地管制医疗和科学所需麻醉品方面，在过去的１８个月中，各国已阻止相当于１．９亿粒药品的１４吨精神药物转入非法渠道。
    报告认为，尽管如此，毒品非法滥用的情况仍十分惊人，尤其用静脉注射法吸入麻醉品的滥用与艾滋病的关系正引起人们严重不安。在欧、美已公布的病例表明，５０％以上与用静脉注射法吸毒有关。
    报告最后强调，进一步加强国际社会各方面的协调合作，严格控制精神药物，采取措施以根除毒品的非法生产、滥用和贩运，保证人们的身体健康和社会安宁。
