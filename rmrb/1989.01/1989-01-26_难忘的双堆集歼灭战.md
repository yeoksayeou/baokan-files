An Unforgettable Annihilation Battle at Shuangdui

He Zhengwen

On November 22, 1948, the East China Field Army annihilated the enemy Huang Bowei Army Group in the Zhuanzhuang area. With this, the first phase of the Huaihai Campaign was successfully concluded. At that time, I served as the Chief of Staff of the Ninth Column of the Central Plains Field Army.

After the annihilation of the Huang Bowei Army Group, the enemy in Xuzhou was in a state of panic. Chiang Kai-shek urgently ordered Du Yuming to command the Qiu Qingquan, Li Mi, and Sun Yuanliang Army Groups to tighten their positions near Xuzhou. At this time, the Li Yanyan and Liu Rumin Army Groups had been blocked by our army south of Guzhen and in the Bengbu area. The Huang Wei Army Group, in order to escape its unfavorable position, was also urgently trying to move towards Xuzhou. When it advanced to the south of Suxian County, to the area of Nanpingji and its southern regions, it encountered strong resistance from our army. The Huang Wei Army Group was one of the elite forces of Chiang Kai-shek's direct command, well-equipped and with strong combat effectiveness. The officers at all levels were all graduates of military academies, known as one of the five major forces of the Kuomintang. If such a force were to be thrown into the battle on the eastern front of Xuzhou, it would be very unfavorable for the entire campaign. The General Front Committee, with Deng Xiaoping as the secretary, promptly seized the changing enemy situation and proposed to the Central Military Commission to first annihilate the distant reinforcement and exhausted Huang Wei Army Group, which was isolated and lacking in supplies. The Central Military Commission immediately replied: "Completely agree to strike Huang Wei first," and pointed out: "In urgent situations, everything will be decided by Liu, Chen, and Deng on the spot, and there is no need to request instructions." A tense pursuit battle against the Huang Wei Army Group began.

On the morning of November 23, the vanguard of the Huang Wei Army Group, the main force of the 18th Army, under the cover of air and artillery fire, launched a fierce attack on the enemy positions of our army in Nanpingji on the south bank of the Guhe River. Based on this situation, the General Front Committee made a wise decision: to voluntarily abandon Nanpingji and some areas, and on the north bank of the Guhe River, to leave a gap to lure the enemy into the pre-set pocket-shaped formation in the southwest of Suxian County, and then concentrate forces to wait for the opportunity to annihilate them. Our Ninth Column was positioned at the southeast edge of the "pocket," with the task of launching an attack along the line from Dongpingji to Zhongyi Ji, driving the enemy across the Guhe River, and attacking the enemy from the southeast, coordinating with the brother columns to annihilate the enemy in the Shuangdui area. This operation, as Deng Xiaoping put it, required the determination of a "beggar burning his bedding." Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "As long as the main enemy forces in the south are annihilated, the Central Plains Field Army can be wiped out, and the various armies of the People's Liberation Army across the country can still achieve victory nationwide. This sacrifice is worth it!"

The action of our army voluntarily leaving a large gap initially gave the enemy a great illusion. As they dug deeper, they realized they had entered our "pocket," and their rear forces were in danger of being cut off, hurriedly retreating south of the Guhe River. By November 27, the Huang Wei Army Group had been compressed by our various columns between the two rivers, in an area centered on Shuangdui, about seven or eight li wide from north to south and about ten li long from east to west, which on a 1:50,000 military map was no larger than the palm of a hand. The southward and northward escape routes were all blocked by our army. Huang Wei, who had come to reinforce, was now trapped and waiting for rescue. The decision of the General Front Committee completely foiled Chiang Kai-shek's plan to "advance north to relieve the siege and defend Xuzhou."

After learning that Huang Wei was surrounded, Chiang Kai-shek discovered our strategic intentions and immediately ordered the Huang Wei Army Group to "ignore everything and immediately attack east with the main force, break through the bandits in front, and join forces with the Li Yanyan Army Group." According to Chiang Kai-shek's orders, Huang Wei urgently ordered his main force of four divisions, under the cover of air force, artillery, and tanks, to launch a breakthrough towards the southeast of Shuangdui on November 28, encountering fierce resistance from our army. In this situation, Chiang Kai-shek changed his orders, instructing Huang Wei to stand firm and defend in place, preparing for a stubborn resistance. The Huang Wei Army Group quickly consolidated and gathered in several villages centered on Shuangdui, constructing a large number of fortified bunkers, forming a circular defensive position, and relying on artillery and tanks to transition to positional defense.

Our army, which was skilled in mountain warfare, suddenly switched to open field assaults, had limited tactical experience. Moreover, some comrades underestimated the enemy's defensive capabilities, becoming impatient, causing the attacking forces to be temporarily stalled, and a stalemate occurred on the battlefield. At this time, the General Front Committee promptly issued instructions, clearly warning the troops: "To overcome impatience," "The enemy is defending and waiting for reinforcements, and it is not easy for us to annihilate them in one go. The decision is to first annihilate the outer layers and peel them off layer by layer from the outside in." The commander of the Ninth Column, Qin Jiwei, the political commissar Li Chengfang, and I studied the method for the troops to carry out the intentions of the General Front Committee, deciding to first target the defensive stronghold of the Huang Wei Army Group—Xiaozhangzhuang, and then gradually peel off layer by layer from Xiaozhangzhuang to Shuangdui. Xiaozhangzhuang is located about four kilometers northeast of Shuangdui, with only seven or eight households, but it was garrisoned by a regiment of the enemy's 10th Army. Within 150 meters around the village, the enemy had constructed three layers of fortifications and obstacles, with dense bunkers and crisscrossing trenches, layer upon layer of firepower, like a "porcupine" on open ground. On November 29, our 27th Brigade's 81st Regiment had once broken through the outer defensive line of Xiaozhangzhuang, but ultimately failed to continue the attack due to the enemy's fierce firepower. The machine gun squad leader of the regiment's 1st Company, Niu Menglian, and two soldiers rushed to the front of the enemy's deer pen, unable to advance or retreat, and had to engage in earthwork under enemy fire. Initially, they only dug a prone shooting cover, which was later expanded into a kneeling shooting cover, and then into a standing shooting cover. Gradually, they connected several covers, forming a fortification that concealed themselves and eliminated the enemy. This experience was quickly promoted in various attacking units. The soldiers took advantage of the night to dig trenches all the way to the enemy's front line, engaging in a "trench-for-trench, bunker-for-bunker" battle with the enemy, effectively weakening the enemy's defensive capabilities. At dusk on December 1, a command was issued, and the attacking forces launched a fierce assault on Xiaozhangzhuang with a barrage of artillery. After more than an hour of intense fighting, the "hard nut" of Xiaozhangzhuang was cracked open, annihilating more than 1,000 enemy soldiers and capturing a large amount of weapons and equipment. On December 3, Deng Xiaoping, the political commissar, commended our column for its combat experience.

After capturing Xiaozhangzhuang, our column immediately entered a state of intense battlefield preparation, carrying out massive engineering work in the open plains. Through the efforts of all officers and soldiers, our column dug more than 50 kilometers of dedicated communication trenches within a depth of seven or eight kilometers, connecting them with bunkers and fire points in a crisscross pattern, forming a strict encirclement and blockade position.

On December 15, the critical moment to annihilate the Huang Wei Army Group arrived. At around 3 PM, the General Front Committee issued the order to launch a general attack. In an instant, the artillery positions of our army lit up with a blinding flash, the cannons roared, and dense shells exploded on the enemy's positions, instantly filling the air with thick smoke. After the artillery preparation, our army launched a powerful offensive. The Fourth Column, with the strength of two brigades, simultaneously attacked the enemy's 85th and 10th Division positions, quickly capturing key points such as Shen Village and Li Village, annihilating two enemy regiments. Our column, with part of its forces, coordinated with the Eleventh Column to launch a fierce assault on the enemy's 14th Army positions, quickly capturing key points such as Zhang Village and Yang Village, annihilating more than 2,000 enemy soldiers from the 223rd and 225th Regiments. The 26th Brigade, using Xiaozhangzhuang as a springboard, directly charged towards Yangsimazi, launching a main assault from the east, breaking through the enemy's front-line positions, capturing five bunkers, and seizing the enemy's cluster fortifications, annihilating the defending 224th Regiment of the 75th Division, capturing the important stronghold of Yangsimazi to the northeast of Shuangdui, as well as key points such as Yangzixiu and Yanglaowu. The 27th Brigade, seizing the opportunity, advanced towards the enemy's depth, quickly capturing key points such as Wuzhuang, Laizhuang, and Jinzhuang. Under the fierce attacks of our various armies, the remaining forces of Huang Wei, who had only the ability to defend but not to counterattack, were in chaos. While the various brother columns were launching fierce attacks on the enemy's central positions, our column decisively charged straight into Shuangdui, quickly capturing the enemy's command post in Ximazhuang, and simultaneously seizing the enemy's artillery positions east of Shuangdui, controlling the temporary airfield in Laizhuang. At midnight on December 15, the once invincible Huang Wei Army Group was completely annihilated.

Shuangdui was brightly lit, like a bustling market. Tens of trucks pulling cannons, military trucks loaded with supplies, and agile jeeps, all driving in all directions under the bright lights. Soldiers and militia were coming and going, some escorting columns of prisoners, some carrying trophies, and others pasting propaganda slogans. Everyone was shouting, laughing, talking, and singing. Seeing this moving scene, I completely forgot the fatigue and hardship of the past month.

　　难忘的双堆集歼灭战
    何正文
    １９４８年１１月２２日，华东野战军在碾庄地区全歼了敌黄伯韬兵团。至此，淮海战役第一阶段胜利结束。当时我任中原野战军第九纵队参谋长。
    黄伯韬兵团被歼后，徐州守敌惊恐万分，蒋介石急令杜聿明指挥邱清泉、李弥、孙元良兵团向徐州附近紧缩。这时，李延年、刘汝明两个兵团已被我军阻于固镇以南及蚌埠地区；黄维兵团为了摆脱不利地位，也在急于向徐州靠拢，当进至宿县西南的南坪集及其以南地区时，遭到我军的强大阻击。黄维兵团是蒋介石嫡系中的精锐部队，装备完好，战斗力较强，各级军官都是清一色的军校毕业生，号称国民党五大主力之一。如果让这样一支力量投入徐州东线作战，将对整个战役十分不利。以邓小平政委为书记的总前委及时抓住敌情变化，向中央军委提出了首先歼灭远道来援且又兵疲粮缺、孤军突出的黄维兵团。中央军委立即答复：“完全同意先打黄维”，并指出：“紧急情况时，一切由刘、陈、邓临机处置，不要请示。”一场对黄维兵团的紧张追击战开始了。
    １１月２３日清晨，黄维兵团的先头部队第十八军主力在空炮火力的掩护下，向浍河南岸的南平集我军阵地猛攻。根据这一情况，总前委作了一个英明的决定：主动放弃南平集和一些地区，在浍河北岸让出一个口子，将敌诱入我军预设在宿县西南的袋形阵地，然后集中兵力伺机围歼之。我们九纵部队位于“口袋”的东南边，任务是在东坪集至忠义集一线发动进攻，把敌赶过浍河，由东南面向敌人围击，与兄弟纵队相配合歼敌于双堆集地区。这次作战，用邓政委的话说就是要有“叫花子烧铺草”的决心，邓政委指出：“只要歼灭了南线的敌军主力，中野就是打光了，全国各路解放军还可以取得全国的胜利，这代价是值得的！”
    我军主动让出一个大口子的行动，一开始给敌人以很大的错觉，当他们越钻越深的时候，才发觉进了我军“口袋”，后续部队有被切断之虞，仓惶向浍河以南畏缩。战至２７日，黄维兵团被我各路纵队压缩在两河之间，以双堆集为中心，南北宽约七八里地，东西长约十来里地的区域内，在五万分之一的军用地图上不过巴掌大的一块地方，南逃北去的道路均被我军封闭。黄维本是来增援的，现在反倒成了被困待援之军了。总前委这一决策，使蒋介石“北上解围，拱卫徐州”的企图彻底破产了。
    蒋介石得知黄维被围后，发现了我军的战略企图，随即命令黄维兵团“应不顾一切即以主力向东攻击，击破当面之匪，与李延年兵团会师”。黄维按照蒋介石的旨意，２８日急令其主力四个师，在空军、炮兵和坦克的掩护下，向双堆集东南方向轮番突围，遭到我军猛烈打击。在这种情况下，蒋介石改令黄维站稳脚跟，就地固守，准备顽抗。黄维兵团随即迅速收缩集结在以双堆集为中心的若干村落内，构筑大量地堡群，形成环形阵地，依托火炮、坦克转入阵地防御。
    善于山地运动战的我军，突然转入平原野战攻坚，在战术上经验是不多的。加之，有些同志低估了敌人的防御能力，产生了急躁情绪，使突击部队的攻势一度受阻，阵地上出现了对峙局面。这时，总前委及时发出指示，明确告诫部队：“要克服急躁情绪”，“敌坚守待援，我不易一鼓攻歼，决心首先歼其外围，由外向里层层‘剥皮’。”九纵队司令员秦基伟、政委李成芳和我一起研究了部队贯彻总前委意图的打法，决心首先拿黄维兵团的防御要点——小张庄开刀，再从小张庄逐步向双堆集层层剥皮。小张庄位于双堆集东北角约四公里处，全村仅七八户人家，却驻守着敌第十军的一个团，环村１５０多米内，敌构筑了三层工事、障碍，地堡密集，壕沟交错，火力层层，尤如开阔地上的一只“火刺猬”。２９日，我纵二十七旅八十一团曾一度突破小张庄的外围防线，但终因敌火力过猛，无法继续进攻。该团一连机枪班长牛孟连和两名战士冲到敌鹿寨前，既攻不上去，又撤不下来，在敌火下被迫进行土工作业。起先只是挖个卧射掩体，后又加工成跪射掩体，逐步又加工成了立射掩体，随之又把几个掩体联接起来，形成了隐蔽自己、消灭敌人的工事。这一经验，很快在各攻击部队得到了推广，战士们利用夜暗把堑壕一直挖到了敌人前沿，与敌人展开了“依沟夺沟，依堡夺堡”的战斗，有效地瓦解了敌人的防御力量。１２月１日黄昏，一声号令，攻击部队群炮齐发，勇士们跃出堑壕向小张庄发起猛攻，经过一个多小时的激战，小张庄这个“硬核桃”被砸开了，全歼守敌１０００多人，缴获大批武器装备。１２月３日，邓小平政委表扬了我纵创造的作战经验。
    小张庄攻克后，我纵部队立即进入了紧张的战场准备，在开阔的平原地带实施工程浩大的迫近作业。经过全体指战员的艰苦努力，我纵在七、八公里的纵深内挖了５０多公里的专用交通壕，以纵横交织的交通壕与地堡、火力点相联，构成了严密的封锁包围阵地。
    １２月１５日，围歼黄维兵团的关键时刻来到了。下午３时许，总前委发出了总攻的命令。顷刻间，我炮兵阵地上发出了一片耀眼的闪光，大炮怒吼了，密集的炮弹在敌人的阵地上轰鸣，顷刻间浓烟滚滚，火烟连成一片。炮火准备后，我军发起了强大的攻势。四纵以两个旅的兵力同时向当面之敌八十五师、十师阵地发起攻击，先后一举夺占了沈庄、李围子等要点，歼敌两个团。我纵以一部兵力协同十一纵向敌十四军阵地发起猛攻，先后夺占了张围子、杨围子等要点，全歼守敌二二三、二二五两个团共２０００余人；二十六旅以小张庄为跳板，直插杨四麻子方向，由正东实施主要突击，一举突破敌前沿阵地，连克五个地堡，占领了敌集团工事，全歼守敌七十五师二二四团，拿下了双堆集东北方向的重要据点——杨四麻子，以及杨子秀、杨老五等要点；二十七旅乘胜向敌纵深发展攻击，一举攻占了吴庄、赖庄、金庄等诸要点。在我各路大军的猛烈攻击下，只有招架之功，而无还手之力的黄维残部，人马嘈杂，一片混乱。在各兄弟纵队向敌中心阵地猛烈攻击的同时，我纵当机立断，一鼓作气直捣双堆集，迅速占领了敌兵团所在地西马庄，同时一举夺占了双堆集以东敌炮兵阵地，并控制了赖庄临时机场。当夜１２时，不可一世的黄维兵团彻底覆灭了。
    双堆集灯火辉煌，有如闹市。拉炮的十轮卡车，载满物资的军用卡车，轻巧的吉普车，照着耀眼的灯光开向四面八方。战士们、民兵们来来往往，有的押着成队的俘虏，有的扛着胜利品，还有的在贴宣传标语，人们都在喊着，笑着，讲着，唱着，看到这动人的场面，我完全忘记了一个多月来的疲劳与艰辛。
