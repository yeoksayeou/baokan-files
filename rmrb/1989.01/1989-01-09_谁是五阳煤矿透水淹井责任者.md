On August 18, 1988, the Five Yang Coal Mine and the Hongqi Coal Mine in Wangqiao Town, Xiangfen County, Shanxi Province, experienced a major flooding incident. Both mines were completely submerged by floodwaters, resulting in the deaths of six people and a halt in production for over 80 days. According to preliminary estimates by the Lu'an Mining Bureau, the direct economic loss from this incident was over 34 million yuan. Restoring normal production at the mine would require an additional 80.853 million yuan in compensation. The Hongqi Coal Mine also suffered significant losses, with direct economic damages amounting to 8 million yuan.

The Five Yang and Hongqi mines are both located downstream of the Zhang River. The Five Yang Mine is a state-owned coal mine with an annual production capacity of over 200 million tons, while the Hongqi Mine is a local township coal mine with an annual production of 5 million tons. From December 1986 to May 1988, the Hongqi Mine repeatedly violated mining boundaries and illegally extracted coal from the safety pillars of the Five Yang Mine, resulting in 11 breaches that connected with the Five Yang Mine's main return airways.

In 1988, Shanxi Province experienced unusually heavy rainfall, particularly in August. On August 18, the Zhang River overflowed its banks, flooding the riverbank and causing ground subsidence. In the afternoon, a surge of water carrying large amounts of sediment rushed into the Hongqi Coal Mine. The water then flowed through the illegally mined and connected return airways into the adjacent Five Yang Mine, paralyzing underground production and trapping 435 miners underground.

The incident drew the attention of central and provincial authorities, who sent investigation teams to the site. Surprisingly, the two investigation teams reached completely different conclusions:

The joint investigation team from central departments concluded after their investigation that this was a major accident caused by negligence. The primary cause was the Hongqi Coal Mine's violation of the national "Mineral Resources Law" and relevant regulations issued by the State Council and the Shanxi Provincial Government. Heavy rainfall was only a secondary factor.

Regarding the handling of this major accident, the joint investigation team from central departments pointed out that the principle of "who operates the mine, who benefits, and who is responsible for safety management and liability" should be followed. The responsibility for the accident should be clarified, and the responsible units and individuals should be severely punished. Economic losses should be compensated to uphold discipline and the law. However, the provincial joint investigation team held a different opinion, attempting to exonerate the Hongqi Coal Mine in their investigation report.

While the provincial investigation team also acknowledged that the Hongqi Mine had violated mining boundaries, they primarily attributed the incident to natural disasters.

This situation is perplexing: each side has its own reasoning, and nearly half a year has passed since the accident, yet there is still no conclusion. When the reporter visited the Five Yang Coal Mine, production was still in a state of partial shutdown, with most of the equipment still submerged underground. The Five Yang Mine is a crucial mine for the Lu'an Mining Bureau, which is China's first modern mining bureau. Suffering such a major loss and yet not taking any action to address it is bewildering.

　　谁是五阳煤矿透水淹井责任者
    本报记者  刘燮阳
    １９８８年８月１８日，山西潞安矿务局五阳煤矿、襄垣县王桥镇红旗煤矿发生了一起重大透水淹井事故，两个矿全部被洪水淹没，死亡６人，停产８０多天，据潞安矿务局初步测算，此次事故，直接经济损失达３４００多万元；恢复矿井正常生产，需补偿费用８０８５．３万元；红旗煤矿损失也十分严重，直接经济损失达８０万元。
    五阳、红旗两个矿同处漳河下游。五阳矿是国营统配煤矿，年产量２００多万吨；红旗矿是地方乡镇煤矿，年产５万吨。从１９８６年１２月到１９８８年５月，红旗矿多次超越矿界开采五阳矿的保安煤柱，乱采滥掘，先后１１处与五阳煤矿总回风巷道贯通。去年，山西襄垣县雨水特多，８月份连续降雨。８月１８日，漳河水漫出河床，淹没河滩，地表塌陷。当日下午１３时，一股洪水带着大量泥沙涌入红旗煤矿井下，接着水又通过被滥掘打通的回风巷道，直奔邻近的五阳大矿，使整个井下生产瘫痪，４３５名矿工被洪水围困在井下。
    事故发生后，引起了中央和山西省有关部门的重视，先后派员到现场调查。令人奇怪的是，对这次事故，两个调查组的观点和结论却截然不同：
    中央各部门联合调查组经过调查指出：这是一起重大责任事故，究其原因，是红旗煤矿违反国家《矿产资源法》和国务院、山西省人民政府有关规定所致。雨水大只是原因之一。
    对这起重大事故的处理，中央各部门联合调查组指出：应根据谁办矿、谁受益、谁负责安全管理和承担责任的原则，澄清事故责任，对事故责任单位和责任者进行严肃处理，赔偿经济损失，以严肃政纪、法纪。然而，省联合调查组却持有不同意见，在调查报告中为红旗煤矿开脱责任。
    该调查组虽然也承认红旗矿违章越界开采，但主要把此次事故强调为自然灾害。
    这真是，公说公有理，婆说婆有理，事故已发生快半年了，至今还没有一个结论。当记者来到五阳煤矿时，生产仍处于半停产状态，大部分分设备还泡在井下。五阳矿是山西潞安矿务局的重要矿井，潞安矿务局又是我国第一个现代化矿务局，遭此重大损失，至今迟迟不作处理，问题在哪里，真叫人费解。
