In the early hours of January 2, two oil barges caught fire and exploded on the Yangtze River near Xintankou in Hubei Province. One of the barges' fires was extinguished after burning for nearly 40 hours, at 15:30 today. The other barge is still burning. The section of the Yangtze River that was closed due to the accident reopened in the afternoon of January 2.

After the accident, the Wuhan Public Security Fire Department dispatched two fire trucks to participate in the firefighting efforts. However, due to the inability of the water cannons to reach the burning points and the limited effectiveness of the available firefighting materials on the burning oil, the fire could not be controlled. At 9:55 AM on January 3, the Guangzhou Military Region dispatched an aircraft to drop fire retardant over the burning barges, which helped control the fire on one of the barges but had limited effect on the other.

Currently, one firefighter has died, seven are missing, and three are seriously injured. It is estimated that the direct economic loss from this serious accident will reach tens of millions of yuan.

The cause of the accident is still under investigation.

　　长江燃烧油驳已有一艘大火被扑灭
    参加灭火消防战士１人牺牲７人失踪３人重伤
    新华社武汉１月３日电  （通讯员张志坚）元月２日凌晨在湖北省新滩口长江江面上爆炸燃烧的两艘油驳，其中有一艘的大火在燃烧了近４０个小时之后，在今日１５时３０分被扑灭，另一艘还在继续燃烧。因事故停航的这一段长江航道也于２日下午复航。
    这次事故发生后，武汉市公安消防处派出两辆消防车参加灭火，由于水枪打不到燃点，现有灭火材料对燃油作用不大，火势未能控制。３日上午９时５５分，广州军区派出一架飞机在燃烧油驳上空投了灭火剂，对控制一艘油轮火情起了作用，但对另一艘收效仍然不大。
    目前，参加灭火的消防战士已有１人牺牲，７人失踪，３人重伤。据预测，这起严重事故的直接经济损失达上千万元。
    目前，事故原因还未调查清楚。
