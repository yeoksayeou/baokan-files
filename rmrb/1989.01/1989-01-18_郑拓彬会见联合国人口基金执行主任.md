The areas of cooperation between the two sides are also expanding.

　　郑拓彬会见联合国人口基金执行主任
    新华社北京１月１７日电  对外经济贸易部部长郑拓彬今天上午在经贸部会见了联合国人口基金执行主任沙迪克博士。
    郑拓彬对沙迪克第七次访华表示欢迎，并赞扬她为促进联合国人口基金同中国的合作所做的贡献。郑拓彬说，十年来联合国人口基金与中国的合作是富有成效的，对中国的人口控制起了积极的作用。双方的合作领域也在不断扩大。
    据悉，联合国人口基金在１９８０年至１９８９年间向中国提供两个周期共１亿美元的无偿援助，用于中国的计划生育和人口普查、人口教育和妇幼卫生等工作。沙迪克在这次访华期间将与中国有关部门商定提供第３周期（１９９０年至１９９４年）援华方案。
    在谈到中国计划生育、控制人口政策时，沙迪克说，中国的计划生育政策是好的，是有成效的。她希望中国政府进一步搞好计划生育政策方面宣传，使人们能够更好了解这一政策。
    沙迪克是应郑拓彬的邀请于昨天抵京的。
