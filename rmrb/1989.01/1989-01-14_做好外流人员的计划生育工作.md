Ensuring Family Planning for Migrant Workers

During the winter of 1988, 58 farmers from Yongji Township in our city left their homes to go to Guangdong, Jiangxi, and other places in order to have more children. A villager from Yongji Village, Jiang Jia Yong, after his wife gave birth to their first son, took his wife and child to Guangdong to make a living. It was only after his wife gave birth to two more sons that he returned to the village with his family.

It is understood that this phenomenon of evading family planning is quite common in some places. It is suggested that relevant departments strengthen the management of migrant workers and plug the loopholes in family planning.

　　做好外流人员的计划生育工作
    １９８８年冬季，我市永济乡有５８个农民为了多生孩子，先后离家去广东、江西等地。这个乡永济村村民蒋家勇，在他妻子生下头胎儿子后，携带妻儿去广东谋生，直到妻子又生了两个儿子，他才携妻带子返回村里。
    据了解，这种躲避计划生育的现象在一些地方相当普遍。建议有关部门加强对外流人员的管理，堵塞计划生育的漏洞。
