Wang Keming, a delegate to the Seventh National People's Congress and a grain specialist from Shangli Village, Lixin Town, Jianning County, Fujian Province, sold 50,000 kilograms of grain at the state-set price at the end of last December and an additional 15,000 kilograms of surplus grain. Since 1982, he has continuously sold 417,500 kilograms of grain over seven years, becoming the household that has sold the most grain in the province.

The 36-year-old Wang Keming contracted 182 mu of land in 1982 to establish a family farm. He has since purchased eight pieces of agricultural machinery and utilized the winter and spring seasons to engage in basic farmland construction. His yield per mu has increased from 250 kilograms in 1982 to 357 kilograms last year.
