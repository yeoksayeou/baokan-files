The majority of people aged 60 and above are reluctant to make a will. Why is this the case?

Firstly, there is a taboo mentality. Some elderly people often avoid discussing "death" and therefore do not want to make a will.

Secondly, there is a sense of self-importance. Some elderly people have a strong desire for control and are accustomed to making decisions on major household matters. They do not want their children and relatives to know about their financial situation.

Thirdly, there is a dependency mentality. Some children are well aware of their parents' financial situation. Without a will, everyone can still get along, but if a will is made, it might cause conflicts. It is better to keep this asset as a "backing" to ensure peace during their lifetime.

Fourthly, there is a fear mentality. Some elderly people do not want their unfilial children to benefit from their estate, but they lack the courage to make a will. They fear that if their unfilial children find out, they might cause trouble, leading to a home without peace.

### 多数老人不愿立遗嘱

　　多数老人不愿立遗嘱
    ６０岁以上的老年人，十之七八不愿“立遗嘱”。原因何在？
    一、忌讳心理。一些老人往往由于讳言“死”而不愿“立遗嘱”。
    二、自尊心理。有些老人支配欲强烈，平时习惯于对家政大事拍板作主，不想让子女及亲属知道自己的财产状况。
    三、依存心理。有些子女对老人的财产状况是一清二楚的。不立遗嘱大家还混得过去，一立遗嘱，反而搞得“你撬我钳”。还是把这笔财产作“靠山”，求得生前的“相安无事”。
    四、恐惧心理。有些老人也不想让那些不孝子、逆子在遗产上占便宜，但却没有勇气立遗嘱，怕不孝子一旦探得消息，打上门来，搞得家无宁日。
