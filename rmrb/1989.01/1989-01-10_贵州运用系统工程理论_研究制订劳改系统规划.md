Guizhou Applies Systems Engineering Theory to Research and Formulate Prison Labor System Planning

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, January 8 - (Reporter Chen Yunzhen) The "Guizhou Province Prison Labor System Strategic Development Planning Research" jointly undertaken by the East China Institute of Technology and the Guizhou Provincial Prison Labor Bureau has recently been approved at the provincial level.

The prison labor system is a special socio-economic system with the dual tasks of reforming criminals and developing production. Applying systems engineering principles to research and formulate development plans for this special system involves the fields of law, psychology, economics, industry, and more, making it a highly challenging task. In August 1986, the East China Institute of Technology and the Science and Technology Development Office of the Guizhou Provincial Prison Labor Bureau jointly undertook the research on this project. Over the past two years, relevant researchers have used a combination of quantitative research and qualitative analysis methods, with statistical analysis as the foundation, to study various aspects of reforming criminals and developing production. They have submitted more than 20 research reports, including "Overall Research Report," "Key Enterprise Consultation," "Crime Phenomena in Guizhou Society," "Quantitative Measurement of Prisoner Behavior Performance," and "TQC in Prison Labor Work," providing scientific decision-making bases for various aspects of the provincial prison labor system and its prison enterprises. This work has made valuable explorations for improving China's prison labor policies and related legislative work.

　　贵州运用系统工程理论
    研究制订劳改系统规划
    新华社贵阳１月８日电  （记者陈云珍）由华东工学院和贵州省劳改局共同承担的《贵州省劳改系统战略发展规划研究》最近在贵阳通过省级鉴定。
    劳改系统是一个特殊的社会经济系统，担负着改造犯人与发展生产的双重任务。运用系统工程学原理，对这一特殊系统的发展规划研究，涉及司法、心理、经济、工业等领域，是一个难度很大的课题。１９８６年８月，华东工学院和贵州省劳改局科技开发处共同承担了这一课题的研究工作。２年多来，有关研究人员，采用定量研究与定性分析相结合的方法，以统计分析为基础，从改造罪犯和发展生产的各个方面进行研究，提交了“总体研究报告”、“重点企业咨询”、“贵州省社会的犯罪现象”、“犯人行为绩效的量化测定”、“劳改工作中的ＴＱＣ”等２０余份研究报告，为省级劳改系统及其劳改企业多方面的工作提供了科学决策的依据，为完善我国劳改政策和有关立法工作做了宝贵的探索。
