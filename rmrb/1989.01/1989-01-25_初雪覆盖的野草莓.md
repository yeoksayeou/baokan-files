Title: Wild Strawberries Under the First Snow

Late autumn, the morning after the first snow in the bend of the Bili River, is particularly clear and bright. The misty morning haze cannot obscure the vitality of the earth. The dense forests on the hillside stand like a solemn army, silent and mysterious. The air is filled with the scent of pine resin, mushrooms, and berries—the mature fragrance of deep autumn, and the refreshing coolness of the first snow. All is quiet, and within this quiet, there is a soft rustling sound. This seems to be the whispered conversations of all things as they rest, rather than a lament for the end of a glorious season.

I gently brush away the soft new snow covering the grassy meadow, searching for the wild strawberries that remain after autumn. I have heard that these strawberries are exceptionally sweet...

It was about ten years ago. I sat with an elderly patient in the hospital room, both of us looking out the window at the snow-covered courtyard. This was the first snow of the year.

I knew little about the old man's background. I had only heard the doctor mention that he had a terminal illness and would not live much longer. He himself seemed not too desperate, and I had never seen him look sad. He had a head of beautiful white hair, like a silver fox fur hat, which made his already thin face look even more gaunt. However, his eyes, sunk deep into their sockets, still shone brightly. Now, he was gazing at the dancing snowflakes, his eyes flickering with excitement and restlessness.

"Have you ever seen wild strawberries?" he suddenly asked me excitedly. "I mean, the strawberries after the first snow... You haven't seen them? I have..." He paused, his hand on his chest, his brow furrowed.

"It was 1941, in the Third Division of the Anti-Japanese Allied Forces," he continued. "We moved to the Gan River area, relying on the hunting people of the Ewenki to fight the Japanese... In one battle, I was injured and hid in a cave..." He was a bit breathless. "An Ewenki girl often brought me food... They only had acorn flour... The beasts were taken by the Japanese... The special agents of the Kwantung Army were watching closely..."

"Rest a bit," I said, seeing him too excited, beads of sweat on his forehead, his face pale, his words disjointed, and I was a bit worried.

"You listen, you..." He insisted on continuing, "At that time, it seemed like I couldn't live... Then the first snow fell... A small birch bark basket... She brought... strawberries... bright red... so sweet! And there was roe deer meat... The Japanese forced her to guide them... She didn't... they killed her... she was only 14 years old..." His body suddenly shook.

"Nurse!" I called out, quickly supporting the old man who was about to collapse.

He had already fainted, and in his delirium, he muttered:

"Strawberries... Anbulen... strawberries... Anbulen..."

From his fragmented words, I could piece together a story. However, I did not know what Anbulen meant. After coming to the Great Khingan Mountains, I asked the Ewenki people, and I guessed it was an Ewenki word. They said it meant quiet. I was a bit confused, as quiet seemed to have no connection with strawberries...

My hands were full of snow and grass, but I did not find any strawberries.

"What are you looking for?" A small girl with high cheekbones and a round face stood in front of me, her bright black eyes smiling at me. She must be an Ewenki girl.

"Strawberries," I said.

She lightly turned and ran to the bushes by the river, as if going to her own garden to pick fruit. In a short while, she returned with a strawberry in her palm. The bright red strawberry still had fine snowflakes on it, shining like a jewel, emitting a sweet fragrance.

"How did you know it was there..." I asked in surprise, then immediately realized it was not necessary to ask, as the Ewenki people are the pride of the mountains and forests.

She placed the strawberry in my palm and turned to leave. I quickly asked:

"Whose family are you from? What is your name?"

"From the family of Malakur, named Anbulen." She flew away.

I was stunned. I should have thought that Anbulen was the name of that little girl. As a name, it should be translated as quiet and good. Of course, this Anbulen is another one.

The sun rose, and on the white snow at the edge of the forest, Anbulen and a group of children walked and sang songs I could not understand.

I looked at the strawberry in my hand, marveling at the mysterious wonder of life. In this tundra where spring comes especially late and winter comes especially early, under the cover of bushes, strawberries can complete their life cycle in the blink of an eye, before the first snow! Compared to pines and cypresses, the life of strawberries is much shorter. However, the fruit offered at the end of this brief life is not also crystal clear and brilliant!

### 初雪覆盖的野草莓

　　初雪覆盖的野草莓
    叶楠
    深秋，毕拉河河湾初雪后的清晨，特别清丽。轻烟般的晨霭，遮不住大地的一派生机。山坡上郁闭的林莽，像肃立的军团，沉静而神秘。空气中充溢着松脂、蘑菇、浆果气味——成熟的深秋芬芳，还有初雪沁人心脾的清新。一片宁静，宁静中透出轻轻的窸窣声。这似乎是万物憩息前相互叮咛的絮语，而不是告别富丽季节的哀叹。
    我用手轻轻拂去草甸上覆盖的柔软的新雪，寻找残留在秋天后面的野草莓，听说过，这种草莓，异常香甜……
    十几年前的事了。我和一位老年病友，并排坐在病房内的窗前，眺望着窗外飘雪的院落。这是那年的第一场雪。
    我对这个老人的身世，不甚了了。只是听医生透露过，他身患绝症，不久于人世了。他本人似乎并不太绝望，从未见他面有戚容。他有一头漂亮的雪白的头发，像一顶银狐皮帽，衬得原本消瘦的面庞更加枯瘪。然而深陷在眼窝里的眸子，还灼灼有神。现在，他凝视着飘舞的雪花想心事，他闪动的目光，泄露了他激动不宁的心绪。
    “你见过野草莓吗？”他突然兴奋地对我说，“我是说第一场雪以后的野草莓……没见过？我见过……”他顿住了，手抚着胸口，颦着眉。
    “那是四一年，在抗联三支队”，接着他又说，“转移到甘河一带，依靠鄂伦春猎民，打鬼子……一次战斗，我负伤了，藏在山洞……”他有点上气不接下气，“一个鄂伦春小姑娘，常给我送吃的……他们……配给……只有橡子面……兽肉给鬼子抢光了……关东军特务看得紧……”
    “歇一会儿。”我看他太兴奋，额上渗汗珠，脸色惨白，语句不连贯，有些担心。
    “你听，你……”他非要说下去，“那会儿，眼看活不下去……下头场雪……一个小桦皮篓……她送来……草莓……鲜红……多甜啊！还有……狍肉……鬼子逼她带路……她不……杀了她……才１４岁……”他身子猛然晃动。
    “护士！”我叫了一声，连忙扶着要栽倒的老人。
    他已经昏迷了，昏迷中发出呓语：
    “草莓……安布伦……草莓……安布伦……”
    从他断续的语句中，我还是能连接起一个故事。然而，我不知道安布伦是什么意思。来大兴安岭以后，问过鄂伦春人，我估计是鄂伦春词汇。回答说，这是安静的意思。我有点困惑，安静似乎和草莓没有关联……
    我的手沾满雪水和草屑，没找到草莓。
    “找什么呀？”一个隆颧骨圆脸庞的小姑娘站在我面前，乌黑明亮的小眼睛含着笑意看着我。她准是鄂伦春女孩无疑了。
    “找草莓。”我说。
    她轻盈地扭身跑到河边的灌木丛，好像去自家园圃采撷果实，不一会儿，掌心里托着一个草莓跑回来。鲜红的草莓上还沾着细碎的雪花，闪着宝石般的光，溢出甜丝丝的芳香。
    “你怎么知道那儿……”我惊喜地问，又立即意识到是不需问的，鄂伦春人是山林的骄子。
    她把草莓放在我手掌上，转身就走。我忙问：
    “你是谁家的，叫什么名字？”
    “玛拉库尔家，叫安布伦。”飞似地去了。
    我愣住了。早该想到安布伦是那个小女孩的名字。作为名字，怕应该译作淑静的好。当然，这个安布伦是另一个。
    太阳升起来了，林边白皑皑的雪地上，安布伦和一群孩子走着，唱着我听不懂的歌。
    我看着手中的草莓，赞叹生命不可思议的神奇。在这春天来得特别迟冬天来得特别早的冻原，在灌木障蔽下的草莓，竟能在转瞬即逝的时光里，赶在初雪，完成它的生命过程！比起松柏来，草莓的生命要短得多。然而，短促的生命终结所奉献的果实，不也晶莹璀璨么！
