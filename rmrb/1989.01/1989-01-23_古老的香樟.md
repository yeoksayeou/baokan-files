	The Ancient Camphor Tree
	Zheng Weiguo

	To touch you is to touch the mighty arm of a mountain,
	The smoke from the mountain's hearth,
	The sunrise over the mountain,
	And the flying clouds all rest in your green palm.
	You persistently wave,
	And what do you entrust to the distant horizon?
	In days past, an old mother sent her son on his journey,
	Right here under this tree they parted ways.
	As they parted, she gave her son one last instruction:
	"When you go far, don't forget to look back at this place!"
	This place has the mother's arm,
	This arm waves along the landscape of the hometown…
	If a wanderer's heart does not have it,
	It is as if the journey has lost its direction.
	Standing in this place, she twists endless hemp threads,
	Her words of sorrow and hope never end.
	She gazes out beyond the camphor tree,
	Seeing the sea, and the sails drifting towards the opposite shore,
	Never to return!

	Her hopes are buried with her,
	Becoming as deep and boundless as the roots of the camphor tree.
	The son returns, and when she appears on the distant horizon,
	He sees this camphor tree
	As a standing statue of his mother.

### 古老的香樟

　　古老的香樟
    郑卫国
    抚摸你如抚摸大山的巨臂，
    山中的炊烟
    山中的日出
    和飞霞都在你绿色的掌上。
    你执著地挥动
    又把什么寄意远方？
    当年一个老母送儿子远行，
    就是在这树下分手。
    分手时嘱儿子一句话：
    走远了莫忘了回头望一望这地方！
    这地方有母亲一只手臂
    这手臂挥动在故乡的风景线上……
    一个游子心中没有它
    就等于远行迷失了方向。
    站在这地方，她捻不完的麻线，
    话不完的愁苦、期望
    她把樟树外的地方望成一片海峡，
    而那飘向海峡对岸的风帆总是不见
    　返航！
    她的期待随她埋进土里，
    变成了樟树根柢一样深沉的奔放。
    儿子归回来了，当她出现在远方的
    　地平线上，
    他一眼就把这棵樟树
    望成了
    屹立的母亲的雕像。
