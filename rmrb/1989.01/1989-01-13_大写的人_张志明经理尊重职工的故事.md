There is a worker in Shaoxing City Material Management Company who has changed jobs several times but never performed satisfactorily. Manager Zhang Zhiming approached him with a friendly demeanor and said, "Please suggest what you would like to do and how you would like to do it."

Seeing the manager's sincere attitude and no hint of reproach, the worker frankly said, "I think I am suited for traveling and trading."

Respecting his wishes, Manager Zhang assigned him to be a supply salesperson. As a result, his enthusiasm and talents were fully utilized, and he became an outstanding supply salesperson.

Some people had objections, saying that work should not be picky. However, Zhang Zhiming said, "Once you discover his strengths, you will find that he is right."

In Zhang Zhiming's eyes, the character "人" (person) is capitalized. He believes that in economic activities, people are the mainstay. Therefore, respecting the dignity and value of people became his principle for ideological and political work.

Wu Chunfu, an honest and hardworking old worker, usually only focused on his work and never caused any trouble. He was so unnoticeable that some people in the company couldn't even recall his name.

One day, Old Wu came to the manager and, after much hesitation, finally let Zhang Zhiming hear: he wanted to retire.

"How, wanting to hold your grandchildren?" Zhang Zhiming said, "I think you should wait. The company is about to distribute housing and gas stoves. After you get them, I will personally send you back to your hometown!"

Zhang Zhiming kept his word. After Old Wu received the housing and gas stove, he was soon dispatched in a "Santana" car.

Old Wu was overjoyed, but tears of excitement welled up in his eyes. He said, "In my life, there have been three great joys: enlisting in the army, getting married, and retiring."

Warehouse keeper Old Xu was also known for his honesty. One day, his mother passed away, and he did not go to work. He worried in his heart, "Will Manager Zhang blame me for neglecting my work and only taking care of personal matters?"

In fact, his worry was unnecessary. That day, when Manager Zhang sent two young men to help him with the funeral arrangements, he was stunned for three full minutes! What he did not expect was that the next morning, Manager Zhang "led more than twenty riders," carrying wreaths to his home. This middle-aged man, who usually had a somewhat wooden facial expression, could not hold back his tears...

Zhang Zhiming's ideological work was successful. The first element of productivity—the subjective initiative of people—was fully utilized, thereby making the company's economic benefits grow at a multiple rate: the sales volume in 1984 was 290,000 yuan, with a profit of 190,000 yuan. By 1987, the sales volume reached 4,520,890 yuan, with a profit of 650,000 yuan. The economic benefits in 1988 were even more remarkable...

    ——张志明经理尊重职工的故事
    邹建中　董建华
    在绍兴市物资经营公司有一位职工，工作岗位调换了好几次，但总是干得不令人满意。张志明找到他和颜悦色地说：“请你自己提提看，你想干什么，怎么干？”
    他见经理态度诚恳，并无半点斥怪之意，就坦率地说：“我觉得我是块走南闯北的料。”
    尊重他的意愿，张经理让他干了供销员。结果，他的积极性和才华发挥出来了，成了一名出色的供销员。
    有人对此有意见，说干工作哪能挑三拣四。张志明却说，你一旦发现了他的长处，就会觉得他是对的。
    在张志明眼中，人字是大写的。他认为，在经济活动中人是主体。因此，重视人的尊严和价值成了他做思想政治工作的准则。
    吴春甫，一位老实巴交的老工人，平时只晓得埋头工作，从不惹是生非。他太不显眼了，公司里甚至有人还叫不出他的名来。
    那天老吴找到经理，吭哧了半天，才让张志明听清：他想退休了。
    “怎么，想抱孙子了？”张志明说：“我看先别忙吧，公司快分房子和煤气灶了。等你分到后，我亲自送你回老家！”
    张志明说话算数，当老吴分到了房子和煤气灶后，不久即派了一辆“桑塔纳”，让老吴坐在里面。
    老吴乐得合不拢嘴，眼里却滚动着激动的泪水。他说：“我一生中大喜的日子有三次：当兵、讨老婆、退休。”
    仓库保管员老徐，也是个出了名的老实人。那天他母亲去世了，他没去上班。他在心里担忧：“张经理会不会批评我丢下工作不管，只顾个人？”
    其实他的担忧是多余的。那天当张经理派了两个小青年来帮他料理丧事时，他足足呆了三分钟！更让他料不到的是，第二天上午，张经理“率领二十余骑”，扛着花圈来到他家。这位平时脸部表情有些木讷的中年汉子，说什么也忍不住那两行热泪了……
    张志明的思想工作是成功的，生产力第一要素——人的主观能动性得到了发挥，从而使公司的经济效益以成倍的速度增长：１９８４年的销售额为２９万元，利润１．９万元，到了１９８７年，销售额达到了４５２０．８９万元，利润６５万元。而１９８８年的经济效益更加可观……
