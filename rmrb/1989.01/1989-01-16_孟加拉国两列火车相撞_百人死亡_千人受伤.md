Two trains collided in Bangladesh today, resulting in at least 100 deaths and 1,000 injuries. This is believed to be the worst railway accident since Bangladesh gained independence in 1971.

A Bangladeshi railway official said that the collision involved an express train and a mail train. The express train was heading to the southern port city of Chittagong, while the mail train was bound for Dhaka. The accident occurred at 7:25 a.m. local time near the industrial city of Dhamrai, about 45 kilometers south of Dhaka.

The cause of the accident is still unknown. However, a railway official suggested that there might have been a signal error on the railway line between Dhaka and Dhamrai.

Military personnel quickly arrived at the scene to assist with rescue efforts and transport the injured to hospitals. By around 10 a.m., they had found 96 bodies.

　　孟加拉国两列火车相撞
    百人死亡　千人受伤
    新华社达卡１月１５日电  今天上午，在孟加拉国中部发生一起两列火车相撞的恶性事故，造成至少１００人死亡、１０００人受伤。据信，这是孟加拉国１９７１年成立以来的最严重的铁路事故。
    孟铁路官员说，在相撞的火车中，一列是快车，一列是邮政火车。快车开往南部港口城市吉大港，邮政火车驶往达卡。达卡时间７点２５分，这两列火车在距达卡以南４５公里处的工业城市栋吉附近相撞。
    一位铁路官员说，发生车祸的原因目前尚不清楚。但是，他又说，很可能是达卡和栋吉之间的铁路信号出现了差错。
    事故发生后，军队立即火速赶往现场进行抢救工作，把受伤者送往医院。到１０点左右，他们已发现９６具尸首。
