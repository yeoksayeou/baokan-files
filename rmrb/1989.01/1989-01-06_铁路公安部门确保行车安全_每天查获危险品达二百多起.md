The railway public security departments in China have been ensuring safe travel by confiscating dangerous items daily, with an average of over 200 cases per day in 1988.

According to a responsible person from the Public Security Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, in 1988, various stations and trains confiscated nearly 90,000 cases of flammable and explosive items. Among these, 4,300 kilograms of explosives, nearly 200,000 bullets, over 50,000 detonators, 14,000 meters of fuse, 29 million firecrackers, and 16 million detonating papers were seized. These items pose a significant threat to the safety of railway transportation and the lives and property of passengers.

It is reported that in 1988, there were 10 fires on passenger trains nationwide, resulting in 40 deaths and 49 injuries. On January 7 of that year, a passenger on the 272nd train from Guangzhou to Xi'an carried paint illegally, causing a fire that killed 34 people and injured 30. On July 1, a car on the 415th train from Beijing to Pingdingshan suddenly caught fire, killing 6 people and injuring 19, with direct economic losses amounting to 230,000 yuan. The investigation revealed that the cause of the fire was that the passenger He Hongcai illegally carried 300 grams of silver powder, which, when rubbed against synthetic materials, generated static electricity, leading to an explosion.

The responsible person stated that although the State Council and relevant departments have repeatedly prohibited the carrying of flammable and explosive items on trains, many passengers still disregard these regulations and try various means to sneak them on board. Some stations have lax management, providing opportunities for those carrying dangerous items, thus posing a serious threat to the safety of people's lives and property.

　　铁路公安部门确保行车安全
    每天查获危险品达二百多起
    新华社北京１月５日电  （实习生刘思扬）我国铁路公安部门在刚刚过去的１９８８年平均每天查获易燃易爆等危险品２４０起。
    据铁道部公安局有关负责人介绍，１９８８年，各地车站和列车上共查获“三品”近９万起，其中查获炸药４３００公斤，子弹近２０万发，雷管５万余枚，导火索１４０００多米，鞭炮２９００多万头，发令纸１６０万张。这些物品对铁路运输和广大旅客生命财产的安全威胁极大。
    据悉，１９８８年全国旅客列车发生火灾１０起，烧死４０人，烧伤４９人。去年１月７日，广州开往西安的２７２次客车，一名旅客违章携带油漆发生燃烧，当场烧死３４人，烧伤３０人。７月１日，由北京开往平顶山的４１５次客车在运行中，一节车厢突然爆燃，６人被烧死，１９人被烧伤，直接经济损失达２３万元。据查，起火原因是，旅客贺洪才违章携带的３００克银粉与化纤品摩擦产生静电，致使银粉爆炸。
    这位负责人说，尽管国务院和有关部委三令五申不准携带易燃易爆物品上车，但不少旅客仍无视这一规定，想尽种种办法企图蒙混过关；一些车站管理不严，也给携带“三品”者钻了空子，给人民生命财产的安全带来严重威胁。
