The current abundant supply of secondary foodstuffs has changed the dominant position of grain in people's dietary structure. The monthly ration for urban residents has evolved from just enough to eat in the 1960s due to the scarcity of secondary foodstuffs to today's surplus. Thus, the exchange of grain tickets for goods has quietly emerged. Currently, all agricultural markets across the country have grain ticket transactions, and quiet streets in various cities often have exchange stalls composed of daily industrial goods. The number of "grain speculators" roaming the streets is countless. The nature of grain tickets has reversed, becoming a "second currency" in people's hands.

China is the only country in the world that still uses grain tickets. Grain, which is closely tied to the national economy and people's livelihoods, is a very precious resource. The supply and demand of grain have always been in a state of tense balance. To boost farmers' enthusiasm for grain production, the state implemented a grain quota purchase nationwide in April 1985. This indicates that the state wants to increase the purchase price of grain, widening the price gap between the planned price and the market price. For every 0.5 kilograms of rice urban residents consume, they enjoy a state subsidy of 0.24 yuan. In 1987 alone, the central and local governments subsidized grain prices by 2.0777 billion yuan. Grain ticket speculators exploit the huge price difference between the planned and market prices, buying grain tickets at prices lower than the state's financial subsidies, purchasing planned-price grain, and profiting from the difference.

There are currently 200 million urban residents nationwide. If we calculate 15 kilograms per person per month, the annual total is 36 billion kilograms. Relevant departments initially estimate that the current monthly grain consumption per person is about 80% to 85% of the quota, resulting in an annual surplus of 30 kilograms of grain tickets per person. Nationwide, urban residents have approximately 6 billion kilograms of surplus grain tickets. If this batch of grain tickets is all used to buy planned-price rice, it would consume 2.8 billion yuan in state grain price subsidies, approximately 1/7 of the total grain price subsidies. Over time, the amount of grain tickets in the hands of the urban population has become considerable. Beijing residents currently have at least 3 to 4 billion kilograms of grain tickets, while Shanghai residents have more than 6 billion kilograms.

According to estimates, Beijing currently has over 500,000 migrant workers from various industries, with 30% of them relying on purchasing Beijing grain tickets to eat planned-price grain. The million-strong floating population also uses similar methods to save on their expenses. These two groups of people have become the main consumers in the grain ticket black market, causing Beijing to lose an additional 50 million kilograms of grain each year.

It is understood that the ultimate goal of the "grain speculators" in illegally purchasing grain tickets is to buy planned-price grain and resell it at a higher price to individuals or even collectives. The next step is to speculate on grain tickets, buying low and selling high.

It can be said that the state's grain price subsidies are the material basis for grain ticket prices, the surplus grain in the hands of urban residents is the medium for realizing grain ticket prices, and the large demand for grain tickets from migrant workers and urban floating populations is the final inducement for the exchange of tickets for goods.

### 在粮票交易的背后

　　在粮票交易的背后
    现时日趋丰足的副食品供应已改变了粮食在人们膳食结构中的主导地位，城镇人口的月定量已由６０年代因副食少而勉强够吃发展到今天的够吃有余，于是以票换物的粮票交易便悄然兴起。目前，全国所有农贸市场都有粮票交易，各城市僻静街道旁都可见由日用工业品组成的交换摊点，走街串巷的“粮倒”更是不计其数。粮票的性质发生逆转，成为人们手中的“第二货币”。
    我国是世界上唯一还使用粮票的国家。系国计民生于一脉的粮食是国家十分宝贵的物资，粮食购销一直处于紧张平衡状态。国家为了提高农民产粮积极性，从１９８５年４月在全国实行粮食定购。这表明国家要增加对粮食的议价收购，拉开粮食的平议差价。全国城镇居民每吃０．５公斤大米，就享受了国家０．２４元的价格补贴。仅１９８７年，中央和地方财政对粮价的补贴就达２０７．７７亿元。粮票贩子就是利用了平、议两种价格形成的巨大落差，用低于国家财政补贴的价格收进粮票，买成平价粮从中渔利。
    全国现有２亿城镇人口，如按每人月定量１５公斤计算，全年就是３６０亿公斤。有关部门初步估计，现在每人月食粮数约为定量的８０％至８５％，一年人均富裕粮票３０公斤，全国城镇人口约富余粮票６０亿公斤。如果这批粮票全买成平价大米，则占用国家粮价补贴２８亿多元，约等于总粮价补贴的１／７。日积月累，全国城镇人口手中粮票已很可观。北京居民手中现有粮票不少于三四亿公斤，而上海居民手中粮票现已愈６亿公斤。
    另据估计，北京目前有各行业农民工５０余万人，其中有３０％的人靠套购北京粮票吃起了平价粮。百万之众的流动人口也采用同样手段节约自己开销。以上两类人成了粮票黑市上“粮倒”的消费大户，使北京市每年额外流失粮食５０００万公斤。
    据了解，“粮倒”们非法套购粮票的最终目的是买平价粮，加价倒卖给个人甚至集体。其次便是倒卖粮票，低价买进，高价抛出。
    可以这样说：国家的粮价补贴是粮票价格的物质基础，城镇居民手中的余粮是粮票实现价格的媒介，而农民工及城市流动人口对粮票的大量需求则成为以票易物的最终诱因。
