    Tianjin is promoting the use of new building materials in conjunction with the renovation of old urban areas, gradually forming lightweight building systems such as slab-beam-column, slab-column, and lift-slab structures. By the end of last year, a total of over 800,000 square meters of lightweight buildings had been completed. The lightweight buildings they construct generally have 8 to 10 percent more usable area compared to brick-concrete structures; the construction cost is also lower than that of brick-concrete structures.
