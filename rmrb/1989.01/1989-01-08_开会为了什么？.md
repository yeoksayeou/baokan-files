	What is the purpose of meetings? Are they for eating, drinking, entertainment, and taking gifts, or are they for solving problems? Unless it is a "banquet meeting," meetings are always held to accomplish some tasks. However, currently, there is a trend in society where meetings are held for eating, drinking, entertainment, and taking gifts. It is not about gathering scholars to discuss important matters, but rather about gathering people to take advantage of the meeting. Everything they eat, drink, play with, and take comes from attending meetings.

	Some people specifically look for meetings that do not address serious issues, while others deliberately organize meetings for eating, drinking, entertainment, and taking gifts. The China Metallic Materials Company, under the Ministry of Materials, held a meeting in Zhangjiagang called a "friendship meeting." What problem was this meeting supposed to solve? The audit did not disclose this. Perhaps, except for "building relationships," this meeting was not necessary at all.

	Nowadays, there are countless "friendship meetings," "thank-you meetings," "discussion meetings," and so on, and they are becoming more and more frequent, especially during holidays. It is not that exchanging feelings is unnecessary, but using feasting, drinking, and taking gifts as the purpose of meetings and calling it "emotional investment" distorts the original intention of friendship activities. Such meeting practices have a wide influence, to the extent that many originally important "work meetings" also follow suit, seemingly not holding a meeting unless it meets high standards. If this continues, it seems that meetings cannot be held without benefits. Look, now some comrades who frequently attend meetings, before they even arrive, ask about the food and accommodation standards. If it does not meet the standards, they put on airs and find excuses not to come. When meetings reach this point, it is truly unclear whether they are held for work or for eating and drinking.

	Meetings should not lose their purpose. Meeting practices should not be corrupted. For this reason, every organizer and participant of a meeting should first ask themselves: "What is the purpose of this meeting?"

　　开会为了什么？
    雨晴
    开会是为了吃喝玩拿，还是为了解决问题？只要不是“聚餐会”，开会总是为了办成几件正事。可眼下，社会上有股不正之风，开会就为吃喝玩乐。不是群贤毕至，商谈要务，而是少长咸集，借会揩油。哥几个吃的、喝的、玩的、拿的，全靠开会了。
    有人专门想参加不办正经事的会，就有人专召开吃喝玩拿的会。物资部下属的中国金属材料公司在张家港开的那个会，名之曰“联谊会”，到底要解决什么问题呢？审计署的调查未予披露。也许，除了“联络感情”，这个会根本就没必要开。
    现在，大大小小的“交谊会”、“答谢会”、“恳谈会”……越开越多，越开越有名堂。特别是到了年节，更是形成会潮。不是说交流感情没有必要，而是说把大吃、大喝、大拿当成开会的目的，还冠之以“感情投资”，这就歪曲了联谊活动的本意。如此会风，影响颇广，以至于许多原本是为解决重要问题的“工作会议”，也纷纷向高标准看齐，似乎不如此，会就开得不够“味”。长此以往，恐怕没有好处就开不成会了。不是吗，现在一些经常参加会议的同志，人还未到，先问会议食宿标准。若是不“达标”，就端起架子，借故不来。会开到这份上，也就真弄不清是为了工作开会，还是为了吃喝开会了。
    会议不能变味。会风不可败坏。为此，每一个会议的主办人和参加者，先要问问自己：“开会为了什么？”
