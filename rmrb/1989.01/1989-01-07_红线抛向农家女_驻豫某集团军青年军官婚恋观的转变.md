Today, young officers have gradually faded out the past notion of "marching towards big cities" in their marriage and love views, and quietly extended the tentacles of love towards the countryside where the commodity economy is relatively developed. Since the beginning of last year, among the 117 newly married officers in a certain group army stationed in Henan, 47 have married rural "ladies," and 48% of unmarried young officers have also engaged with "rural girls" for life.

The development of the commodity economy has given rise to a new image of rural girls in the 1980s. Young officers no longer consider marrying rural girls a "burden" or a "devaluation." They have to look at rural girls in a new light. He Mu Lin, a political department officer from a certain regiment in Shanghai's suburbs, chose a weaving worker Sun Ai Ju from his hometown during his two periods of advanced studies, despite having four female classmates in Shanghai seeking his affection.

Xue Bing, a sergeant from Sichuan driving a truck, declined the good intentions of his superiors and comrades-in-arms to introduce him to girlfriends in big cities like Zhengzhou and Luoyang in Henan, and instead married a poultry-raising girl from his hometown.

"He has the modern youth's consciousness, a certain economic acumen, can endure hardship, knows how to live, and gives a sense of reliability. I am very satisfied. Of course, I am not a materialist and will not use money as a yardstick for love. I pursue her pure inner beauty," Sergeant Xue talked about his wife with ease.

"Why didn't you, with a bachelor's degree and as a platoon leader, find a girl with better conditions in a big city?" We asked Huang Junjie, who had just gotten married.

"To be honest, I did have that thought. Finding a city 'miss,' it's prestigious, good-looking. But I also thought it was not very realistic."

"Why not realistic?" We blurted out.

"I enlisted from the countryside, and I married Xiao Huang, whose family is also in the countryside. First of all, there's no worry about housing. She can both farm the responsibility fields and take care of my parents. When we have children, we won't need to spend money on a nanny. The family can live harmoniously, which is quite good. But for city girls, it's hard to achieve."

Xiao Huang's words made us understand a truth: It is undeniable that today's young officers' choices in marriage and love are increasingly tending towards realism.

A political department officer, Wu Fusheng, from a certain division, recounted an incident: During a frontline battle, his wife sent him a piece of broken moon cake, writing in the letter, "Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival. I took a bite of this moon cake, and the child also took a bite. You eat it, and it's as if our whole family is together." Little Wu held the moon cake, his heart unsettled. He also said, "She understands and supports my career, which is something that city girls with superior conditions generally cannot do. The profession of a soldier has chosen sacrifice and dedication, and rural girls also possess this quality."

"I will be able to take her with me when I am promoted to the rank of a company commander. She can support me in serving in the army for more years," Officer Wu proudly talked about their future.

The soul is the shining board of thought. Wang Li, the new bride from Gu Shi County in the Dabie Mountains, objectively talked about their love story: "Compared to those city girls, I have some differences, but he does not despise me. The military merit also has my half. I understand this truth, can shoulder the burden of the family, not let him be distracted in the army, and I am ready to endure hardship and suffering."

After finishing this interview, we suddenly came to a conclusion: Throwing the "red thread" to "rural girls" is a significant shift in the marriage and love views of young officers in the army today, which may have a positive impact on the construction of the army.

　　红线抛向农家女
    ——驻豫某集团军青年军官婚恋观的转变
    刘敬彬　张国铭
    今天，青年军官已将过去向“大城市进军”的婚恋观念渐渐淡化，悄悄把爱情的触角伸向商品经济较为发达的乡村。去年年初以来，驻豫某集团军１１７名新婚军官中，有４７人与农家“闺秀”结为百年之好，还有４８％的未婚青年军官也同“农家女”订下了终身。
    商品经济的发展，使八十年代的中国农村姑娘出现了崭新的形象。青年军官们再也不认为找农村姑娘“累赘”、“掉价”。他们不得不对农村姑娘刮目相看了。从上海市郊入伍的某旅政治部正连职干事郝军林，两次进院校深造期间，有４位在上海市工作的女同学写信或托人向他求爱，而他却选中了本村编织工孙爱菊。
    四川籍汽车排长薛冰，谢绝了领导和战友给他在河南郑州、洛阳等大城市介绍女友的好意，同家乡一位养鸡姑娘结为伉俪。
    “她有现代青年人的思想意识，有一定的经济头脑，能吃苦，会生活，给人一种踏实的感觉。我很满意。当然，我不是拜金者，不会把金钱作为爱情的砝码。我追求的是她纯朴的内在美。”薛排长提起他的妻子，侃侃而谈。
    “你是本科毕业，又是连长，咋不在大城市找个条件好些的姑娘？”我们探问结婚不久的黄俊杰。
    “老实说，我也曾有过那念头。找个城里的‘洋小姐’，体面，好看。但我又琢磨着不太现实。”
    “咋不现实？”我们冒失地追问。
    “我是从农村入伍的，我同小黄结婚，家都在农村，首先不为住房犯愁。她既能种责任田，又能替我孝敬父母。等有了孩子，也不需花钱请保姆。一家人和和睦睦过日子，蛮好的。而城里的姑娘呢，就难做到了。”
    小黄的一番话，使我们明白了一个道理：不可否认，当今青年军官对婚恋的选择，越来越趋向现实。
    某师政治部干事吴福生，讲了这样一桩事：在前线参战时，妻子邮去一块残缺的月饼，信中写道：“今天是中秋节，这块月饼我吃了一口，孩子也咬了一口。你吃了它，就算我们全家团圆了。”小吴捧着月饼，心里很不平静。他又说：“她理解并支持我的事业，这是具有优越条件的城市姑娘一般难以做到的。军人的职业选择了牺牲和奉献，农村姑娘也具备这种品质。”
    “我一旦晋升到营职，她还可以随军，支持我在部队多干些年。”吴干事自豪地谈了他们的将来。
    心灵是思想的闪光板。家在大别山区固始县的新娘王莉客观地说了他们的恋爱史：“同那些城市姑娘比，我是有些差别，但他不嫌弃我。军功章也有我的一半。我懂得这个道理，能够挑起家中的担子，不让他在部队分心，我已作好吃苦与忍受的准备。”
    结束这次采访，我们蓦然得出这样结论：把“红线”抛向“农家女”，是目前部队青年军官婚恋观的一大转向，这对部队建设也许会起到积极作用。
