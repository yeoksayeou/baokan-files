China's aviation industry achieved four major successes last year. According to information recently obtained by reporters from relevant departments of the Ministry of Aerospace Industry, in 1988, the aerospace industry implemented the policy of combining military and civilian efforts with remarkable results. The industry experienced an unprecedented number of large-scale tests, the most satellite launches, the best economic benefits, and the highest number of export deals, marking a "fourfold joy" trend.

	— Conducted ten large-scale flight tests, all of which were successful and achieved the expected goals.
	— Launched four application satellites, including two practical communication and broadcasting satellites, one experimental meteorological satellite, and one recoverable satellite.
	— Achieved simultaneous growth in total industrial output value, sales revenue, and taxes. Compared to 1987, profits increased by 38 percent. The output value of civilian products grew by 33.6 percent, accounting for 79.5 percent of the total industrial output value.
	— Set a new record for foreign trade exports. Made progress in providing satellite launch services to foreign countries, successfully providing satellite launch services for the Federal Republic of Germany in 1988, and signing a contract to launch two communication satellites for Australia.

　　我国航空工业去年四喜临门
    新华社北京电  （通讯员孙民强、记者陈智强）记者近日从航空航天工业部有关部门获悉：一九八八年航天工业贯彻军民结合方针成绩突出，出现该行业有史以来大型试验最多、卫星发射最多、经济效益最好、出口成交最多的“四喜临门”好势头。
    ——进行十次大型飞行试验，次次获得成功，达到预期的目的。
    ——发射四颗应用卫星。即两颗实用通信广播卫星、一颗试验气象卫星和一颗返回式卫星。
    ——实现工业总产值、销售收入、利税同步增长。与一九八七年相比，利润增长百分之三十八。民品产值增长百分之三十三点六，占工业总产值的百分之七十九点五。
    ——外贸出口创历史最高水平。对外发射服务取得进展，去年又成功地为联邦德国提供了卫星搭载服务，签订了为澳大利亚发射两颗通信卫星的合同。
