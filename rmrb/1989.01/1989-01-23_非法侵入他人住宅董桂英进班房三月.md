A worker from the Dafen County Grass Dike Plastic Factory in Jiangsu, Dong Kuiying, was recently sentenced to three months in detention by the Dafen County People's Court for illegally entering another person's residence.

Last March, Dong's family home was destroyed by a fire. Dong applied to the township government for a new residence and demanded the use of a disputed plot of land behind the original residence, which belonged to his neighbor, Xue Guizhen. Without obtaining approval, Dong's family began to prepare the land, which was opposed by Xue Guizhen, leading to a dispute. Dong then broke into Xue's home, slept on the bed fully clothed, urinated on the floor, and threw trash around, causing chaos in Xue's home. That night, Dong also called his father-in-law, daughter-in-law, and granddaughter to stay at Xue's home, forcing Xue Guizhen's family to leave their home.

　　非法侵入他人住宅董桂英进班房三月
    本报讯  江苏大丰县草堰塑料厂工人董桂英，因非法侵入他人住宅，最近被大丰县人民法院依法判处拘役３个月。
    去年３月底，董家因失火烧毁住房，董向乡政府申请新建住宅，并要求使用原住房后面与邻居薛桂珍家有争议的一块空地。在没有得到批准的情况下，董家开始在空地上整地，遭薛桂珍干涉，发生纠葛。董便闯入薛家，和衣睡在床上，随地小便、扔废纸，糟踏薛家。当晚，董还喊来其公公、儿媳、孙女一起到薛家吃住，致使薛桂珍一家被迫弃家离去。　　　　　　　　（曹菊生　朱德富）
