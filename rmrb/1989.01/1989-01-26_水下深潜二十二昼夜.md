On the morning of January 25, the experimental hall for saturation diving at the Shanghai Naval Medical Research Institute was filled with people early in the day.

At 9:30 AM, four naval divers dressed in diving suits stepped out of the saturation diving experimental chamber, waving to the crowd who had come to congratulate them. This was after they had spent 22 days and nights underwater. Standing by to welcome them was Liu Jinqiang, the commander of the saturation diving training team, who joyfully told everyone that this simulated saturation dive to 350 meters was successful and set a new Asian record of 374 meters for saturation diving. This marked that China now has divers who have mastered the technology of deep-sea helium-oxygen saturation diving.

He introduced that underwater is a high-pressure environment. After divers stay at a certain depth for a long time, the partial pressure of gases in their body becomes completely balanced with the partial pressure of the inhaled gases, reaching a state of saturation where the gases no longer increase in solubility. Using this method of diving allows for a long stay underwater and high work efficiency, making it an important means for rescue operations, salvage work, and marine development. However, training a saturation diver is quite challenging. In addition to undergoing dozens of skill trainings such as brain function, cardiovascular function, lung function, hearing function, and balance function, one must also conduct deep-sea diving operations and equipment technology training. The four divers who participated in this experiment were selected from dozens of naval divers and had undergone rigorous training.

The experiment began on January 3. In the morning, the four divers entered the saturation diving experimental chamber. At 16:50 on January 6, they successfully dove to a simulated saturation depth of 350 meters. At 17:00, diving team leader Liu Jie sent a message from underwater to the experimental chamber outside: "Everything is normal underwater!" From that day on, the divers almost every day sent messages through the transfer hatch on the wall of the saturation diving living chamber to Liu Jinqiang, maintaining constant communication between underwater and above water, with their hearts connected.

On January 7, diver Ban Shaoxue sent an application to join the party from underwater, requesting Liu Jinqiang to forward it to the party organization.

On January 11, diver Wang Junwei's thought report was sent up from underwater: "Nine days in the saturation diving chamber have been spent in a relaxed and happy manner. Due to high pressure, the living space is small, and the resistance to breathing is increased. After eating a few mouthfuls, I have to take a few deep breaths, but I strive to overcome this. We encourage each other, and the 370-meter patrol dive was successfully completed..."

Diving team leader Liu Jie also sent a work report from underwater to Liu Jinqiang: "Deep-sea saturation diving is dangerous, but for the sake of scientific experimentation, we fear nothing. Life underwater is quite interesting. We brush our teeth, have meals, clean up, measure basic physiological parameters, perform patrol dives, listen to radio news after dinner, read newspapers, play chess, watch TV, listen to popular songs, and sometimes even dance to the rhythm of disco music to exercise our limbs and better perform diving operations. Before bed, we can take a refreshing shower, and it's quite enjoyable."

The divers underwater were thinking about the experiment, about joining the party, about achieving merits, and also about their future lives and ideals.

### 水下深潜二十二昼夜

　　水下深潜二十二昼夜
    新华社记者  黄彩虹
    １月２５日上午，上海海军医学研究所饱和潜水实验大厅里，早早地挤满了人群。
    ９点３０分，４名身穿潜水服的海军潜水员，精神抖擞地跨出饱和潜水实验舱，挥手向前来祝贺的人们致意。这是他们在水下生活了２２个昼夜后重新回到了水上。站在一旁迎候他们的饱和潜水训练队队长刘金刚高兴地对大家说，这次模拟饱和深潜３５０米成功，并创造了饱和潜水３７４米的亚洲新纪录，标志着我国已经有了掌握大深度氦氧饱和潜水技术的潜水员。
    他介绍说，水下是个高压世界。潜水员在一定深度下经过很长时间以后，体内气体的分压与呼吸进去的气体的分压完全相平衡，达到了饱和程度，气体便不再增加溶解量。采用这种方式潜水，在水下停留的时间长，作业效率高，是进行援潜救生、打捞作业和开发海洋的重要手段。然而，训练一名饱和潜水员，难度相当大。除了进行脑功能、心血管功能、肺功能、听功能和平衡功能等数十种技能训练外，还要开展大深度水下潜水作业和装具技术训练。这次参加实验的４名潜水员，是从海军数十名潜水员中挑选出来的，都经过了严格的训练。
    实验从１月３日开始。上午，４名潜水员走进饱和潜水实验舱。６日１６时５０分，他们成功地潜到３５０米的模拟饱和深度。１７时，潜水班长刘杰从水下向实验舱外传来一封报喜信：他们在水下一切正常！从这天起，潜水员几乎每天通过饱和潜水生活舱壁上的传物舱口给队长刘金刚传递讯息，水下水上书信往来，息息相通，心心相印。
    １月７日，潜水员班绍学从水下递上来入党申请书，请求刘金刚转交给党组织。
    １月１１日，潜水员汪军伟的思想汇报又从水下递上来了：“进入饱和潜水舱９天，是在轻松和愉快中度过的。由于高压，生活空间小，吸气阻力增大，每吃几口饭就要猛喘上几口气，但我努力克服。我们相互鼓励，３７０米巡潜终于顺利完成了……”
    潜水班长刘杰还从水下给刘金刚写来了工作汇报：“大深度饱和潜水虽有危险，但为科学实验探路，我们什么都不怕。水下生活很有意思。我们每天洗漱，进餐，打扫卫生，测基础生理参数，进行巡潜作业，晚饭后还收听广播新闻，阅读书报，下棋，看电视，听流行歌曲，有时还踏着迪斯科音乐的节奏跳一跳，活动活动筋骨，以便更好地潜水作业。就寝前，还能痛痛快快地洗个澡，过得很愉快。”
    潜水员们在水下想着实验，想着入党，想着立功，也想着今后的生活和理想。
