Filling a Gap in Archaeology: Artifacts from the Brief Northern Zhou Dynasty Reappear
Rare Northern Zhou Tombs Discovered in Xianyang

Xian, Jan. 17 (Xinhua) — Archaeological findings related to the Northern Zhou Dynasty have yielded a rich harvest in China — a rare group of Northern Zhou tombs has been discovered in Xianyang, unearthed over 3,000 precious artifacts. This discovery not only fills a gap in Northern Zhou archaeology and a missing link in Chinese archaeology but also enriches historical records and documents, providing abundant material evidence for the study of Northern Zhou politics, economy, and culture.

This group of Northern Zhou tombs was discovered by archaeologists from Shaanxi Province last spring and summer during the construction of the Xianyang International Airport. After more than half a year of excavation and cleaning, a total of 18 single and double burials were found, including 17 sloping tombs and one vertical pit tomb. The sloping tombs have ramps, corridors, wells, passages, stone doors, and front and rear chambers; the vertical pit tomb is rectangular, over 13 meters deep, with a side chamber dug into the bottom of the pit for placing the coffin. Among these tombs, four are double burials with coffins and outer coffins largely intact. Research has shown that the tomb owners were mostly of high status, such as royal relatives and high-ranking military officials like the General of the Left Guard Wang Shiliang and the Grand General Wang Jun.

The artifacts unearthed from these tombs are extremely rich. Among them, more than 20 gold hairpins, gold earrings, silver hairpins, and silver bowls are dazzling and exquisitely crafted; 24 bronze tripods, cauldrons, tripods, and incense burners are finely shaped and vividly decorated; over 30 pieces of Northern Zhou porcelain are glossy and of high quality; more than 100 pieces of pottery jars, houses, inkstones, granaries, and pestles are ancient and ingeniously designed; dozens of jade bi discs, jade belts, jade hairpins, and jade plaques are translucent like mutton fat, with visible jade patterns; nearly 2,000 warrior figurines, heavenly king figurines, horse-riding figurines, musician figurines, lady figurines, and dancer figurines are lifelike.

Among these artifacts, a gold-inlaid jade belt worn by a high-ranking general is particularly exquisite: it is made of multiple jade pieces strung together with gold wire and gold nails, with jade pieces carved with rose patterns, leaves, and geometric designs, and gold foil backing, with silk in between. The entire jade belt is intricately carved and shines brilliantly, reflecting the high craftsmanship of the Northern Zhou Dynasty. A four-eared porcelain jar from the Northern Zhou period has a crystal-clear greenish-yellow glaze and a crackle pattern all over, making it a rare masterpiece among early Chinese porcelain. Over 200 Northern Zhou Wushu coins and knife-shaped coins are a significant discovery, correcting the previous misconception that "the Northern Zhou did not have Wushu coins and continued using Han Wushu coins." A jar of rice husks and a pottery pestle found indicate that Chang'an during the Northern Zhou period had a mild climate and abundant rice production, along with the unearthed iron hoes and iron knives, reflecting the level of productivity at that time.

Guan Anzhi, deputy researcher of the Sui-Tang Research Room of the Shaanxi Provincial Institute of Archaeology, told the reporter: The Northern Zhou Dynasty (557-581 AD) had its capital in Chang'an, conquered the Northern Qi, and unified the north. It was an important dynasty in Chinese history that cannot be overlooked.

However, due to its short duration of only 25 years, there are limited artifacts, and Northern Zhou archaeology has been almost blank since the founding of the People's Republic. Historical records and documents are also too brief and sometimes inaccurate. This time, five tomb inscriptions were unearthed, some of which corroborate historical records, while others correct errors and enrich the content of historical records and documents.

　　填补考古一段空白　短促王朝文物再现
    咸阳发现罕见北周墓葬群
    本报西安１月１７日电  记者孟西安报道：我国北周文物考古喜获丰收——在咸阳发现罕见的北周墓葬群，出土各类珍贵文物３０００多件，不仅填补、衔接了北周考古的空白和我国考古学的缺环，丰富了史书和文献的内容，也为研究北周的政治、经济、文化提供了丰富的实物资料。
    这一北周墓葬群，是陕西省考古工作者于去年春夏在咸阳国际机场施工工地发现的。经过半年多的发掘和清理，共发现单人及合葬墓１８座，其中１７座为斜坡式墓，一座为竖穴土洞式墓。斜坡式墓有墓道、过洞、天井、甬道、石门及前后室；竖穴土洞式墓呈长方形，深１３米多，在墓穴底部侧壁掏洞为室置放陪棺。这些墓葬中有四座合葬墓，棺椁基本完好。经考证，墓主大都身份较高，如皇亲贵戚和朝廷武将骠骑将军王士良、大将军王钧等。
    从这批墓葬出土的文物十分丰富。其中，２０多件金钗、金耳坠、银簪、银钵等光泽夺目，工艺精美；２４件铜鼎、釜、鬲、熏炉造型精致、图饰生动；３０多件北周瓷器光泽莹润，质地精良；１００多件陶罐、屋、砚、仓、杵等古朴逼真、匠心独运；数十件玉璧、玉带、玉簪、玉牌晶如羊脂、玉霞可见；近２０００件武士俑、天王俑、骑马俑、使乐俑、仕女俑、舞俑等，更是栩栩如生。
    在这批文物中，有一件上将军佩戴的金镂玉带尤为精美：它的多枚玉片用金丝金钉穿缀而成，玉片雕有玫瑰、树叶和几何图案，下有金片衬底，中间夹有丝绸。整个玉带雕镂穷奇，熠熠闪光，反映北周高超的工艺水平。北周瓷器中一件４耳瓷罐，釉色晶莹绿黄，通体呈冰裂纹，十分精美，为我国早期瓷器中罕见的精品。２００多枚北周五铢钱和形五百、刀形币等铜币，是北周货币的空前发现，它纠正了过去“北周无五铢、沿用汉五铢”的传统说法。发现的一罐稻壳和一件陶杵，说明长安在北周时，气候温润，盛产水稻，加之出土的铁锄、铁刀等工具，反映了当时的生产力发展水平。
    陕西省考古研究所隋唐研究室负责人、副研究员贠安志告诉记者：北周（公元５５７—５８１年）建都长安，曾灭北齐统一北方，是我国历史上不可忽视的一个朝代。
    但是，由于它历时短促，仅２５年，文物遗存有限，建国后北周文物考古基本处于空白，史书和文献记载也过于简约，且有失真。这次出土的墓志铭有５块，有的印证了史书文献记载，有的纠正了史书上的伪词讹传，丰富了史书文献内容。
