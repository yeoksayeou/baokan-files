A cargo ship carrying Taiwanese rice docked in Xiamen on January 17, marking the first time in 40 years that Fujian has purchased rice from Taiwan.

The shipment consists of 15,000 tons of Taiwanese "Penglai" rice, transported by an Indonesian vessel. The ship set sail from Taichung City on January 13 and arrived in Xiamen via Hong Kong.

It is understood that this batch of rice has been stored in Taiwan for two years and is priced lower than rice from Southeast Asian regions. Taiwanese rice is of the japonica type and is known for its fluffy and delicious texture, making it suitable for the taste preferences of Fujian residents. This batch of Taiwanese rice will be released to the market before and after the Spring Festival.

    台湾大米运抵福建
  　一艘载运台湾米的货轮１月１７日驶靠厦门，这是４０年来福建第一次从台湾购进大米。
    这批台湾产“蓬莱”米共１．５万吨，由印尼货轮承运。货轮１月１３日从台中市启航，经香港转行厦门。
    据悉，这批大米在台湾储藏两年，价格比东南亚地区便宜。台湾米属粳型籼性，做饭松爽可口，适合福建居民口味。这批台湾米将于春节前后投放市场。
