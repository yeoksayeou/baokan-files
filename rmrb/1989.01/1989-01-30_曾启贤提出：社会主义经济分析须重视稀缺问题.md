Wuhan University professor Zeng Qixian, in an article published in the tenth issue of the 1988 volume of *Economic Research*, emphasized that the issue of scarcity should not be exclusively considered within Western economic theory. Socialist economic analysis must also place significant emphasis on scarcity. The concept of scarcity in economic theory refers to the limited nature of human and material resources, as well as natural resources, relative to human needs at any given time. Scarcity means that resources are finite. This is a universal objective reality in human society and the basis for Marx's emphasis on conserving and proportionally allocating labor and natural resources. It is also a prerequisite for economic analysis. While the development of productive forces and technological progress can alleviate the pressure of scarcity for a certain period, they cannot truly eliminate the scarcity of resources. However, in the traditional socialist economic theory that originated in the Soviet Union in the 1930s, the issue of scarcity has never been addressed, as if the establishment of socialist production relations could eliminate the problem of scarcity. This traditional theory has had serious consequences for socialist economic practice, often leading to the wasteful use of land, capital, labor, and even the arbitrary destruction of resources.

Currently, China is at a critical juncture in deepening economic reforms and seeking stable economic development. The importance of scarcity in socialist economics cannot continue to be ignored or denied. Otherwise, whether in the short term or the long term, it will be detrimental to a country with a population of over one billion.

### 曾启贤提出：社会主义经济分析须重视稀缺问题

　　曾启贤提出：   
    社会主义经济分析须重视稀缺问题
    武汉大学教授曾启贤在《经济研究》一九八八年第十期著文，强调稀缺问题不应专属西方经济理论，社会主义经济分析也必须十分重视稀缺。经济理论中所说的稀缺，是指相对于一定时点上人类的需要，不论是人力资源或物化劳动资源与自然资源都是有限的。稀缺就是资源有限。这是人类社会普遍存在的客观现实，是马克思所强调的节省和按比例分配劳动资源和自然资源的依据，也是进行经济分析的前提。生产力发展和科技进步虽可在一定时期内缓解稀缺的压力，但不能真正消除资源稀缺。但在始源于苏联三十年代的传统的社会主义经济理论中，却一直没有稀缺问题的位置，似乎建立了社会主义生产关系就可以消除稀缺问题。这种传统理论，已给社会主义经济实践带来严重后果，常常滥用与浪费土地、资金、人力等资源，甚至随意破坏资源。
    当前正是我国深化经济体制改革和力求经济稳定发展的关键时期，稀缺在社会主义经济中的重要地位不容继续忽视乃至否定了。否则，无论是从短期还是从长期看，对于一个有十亿以上人口的大国，都是有百害而无一利的。
