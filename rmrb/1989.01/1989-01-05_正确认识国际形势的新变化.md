After World War II, the international situation underwent tremendous and profound changes. For instance, the Yalta system was established in international relations, which has now evolved into a situation of one world, two systems, multiple economic and political poles, and coexistence through competition. Human history saw the emergence of superpowers for the first time. The appearance of a series of socialist countries and the rise of the Third World significantly reduced the territory of capitalism. Traditional capitalism developed into modern capitalism. Real existing socialism also surpassed the imagination of classical writers in many aspects. The world economy achieved unprecedented development. The rise of the new technological revolution had a profound impact on the development of human society and the changes in international relations. Peace and development replaced war and revolution as the main themes of the contemporary world, and so on.

The changes in objective reality were so obvious, but for a long time in the past, due to the "leftist" guiding ideology, we were confined to outdated ideas and could not make accurate assessments of the situation. This affected practical work, leading to certain deviations and mistakes. After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the Central Committee advocated emancipating the mind and rectifying past mistakes, gradually gaining a realistic and sober understanding of the international situation. It was decided to further adhere to an independent foreign policy, implement an open-door policy, expand international exchanges, and continuously adjust and improve foreign policies and measures. Under these circumstances, the study of international issues saw a major turning point and rapid development. However, overall, the exploration and discussion were not active enough, and there was a lack of in-depth research on some fundamental issues of the contemporary world. Systematic theoretical summaries were not made in a timely manner, and some outdated ideas were still adhered to. This, of course, cannot be entirely attributed to the academic community itself. However, it is undeniable that the study of international issues did not keep up with the changing situation and was somewhat lagging behind.

Practice is stronger than theory. The world is undergoing rapid changes. By the mid-1980s, the international situation underwent a new turning point. The imbalanced economic and political development of the major powers led to significant changes in their strength, status, and the world order. This is mainly reflected in the significant decline in the strength of the United States and the Soviet Union and the rapid development of the trend towards multipolarity, especially the significant rise in the strength of Japan. This rise and fall of power and change in status are still ongoing. Therefore, the U.S.-Soviet relations, which have played a decisive role in international relations since the end of the war, have undergone significant changes. From the military confrontation in the form of an arms race and regional disputes, it has transformed into a confrontation in the form of dialogue and "managing crises," focusing on comprehensive national strength competition. With the easing of U.S.-Soviet relations, the world will enter a relatively long period of about 10 to 15 years or more of relative easing. During this period, the influence of global political and military confrontations in international affairs will gradually weaken, while economic and technological competition will become increasingly fierce. In a sense, it can be said that the arms race and military security have taken a back seat, while economic competition and economic security have become the top priority. Countries are paying more attention to the development of their own economies and technologies, preparing for strategic positions in the 21st century, and thus are accelerating adjustments and reforms. However, due to the difficulty in solving several serious imbalances in the world economy in the short term, adjustments and reforms will take time. Therefore, it is estimated that in the next 10 years, the world economy will not be able to get out of the stage of low-speed development. However, with the progress of adjustments and reforms in the world and major breakthroughs in technological revolution, it is possible that the early 21st century will see another period of rapid development in the world economy.

In the context of the increasing focus of international competition on the economic and technological fields, global internationalization and interdependence are rapidly developing, while globalization is becoming an irreversible trend in the world economy. The North American Free Trade Area, the unified market of the European Community, the Asia-Pacific economic circle actively promoted by Japan but not yet finally formed, and the existing Council for Mutual Economic Assistance have become the four major economic blocs in the world. The focus of competition is on securing technological leadership and export markets. Countries are trying to adapt to the development of internationalization on the one hand, and preparing to cope with increasingly fierce competition and various forms of protectionism on the other. In the future, the determining factor of a country's global status will not be military wars, but economic and technological "wars."

Of course, we should not overlook the other side of the problem. Although the arms race and regional disputes between the United States and the Soviet Union are cooling down, there is a trend towards further disarmament and political resolution of some regional conflicts, the easing of U.S.-Soviet relations is also fragile. This, in addition to the differences in systems, is mainly due to the fact that the strategic pattern of the two sides as opponents has not fundamentally changed, plus the conflicts of interest, historical grievances, mutual distrust, and possible accidental events, especially the development of the arms race to a higher level. Therefore, there is still the possibility of setbacks and twists and turns, and we cannot only see the easing side and be overly optimistic, relaxing vigilance. However, the weakening of U.S.-Soviet confrontation and the easing of the international situation will undoubtedly be the main trend for a period of time. This point has almost become a consensus among countries around the world, and each country is adjusting its domestic and foreign policies and revising its development strategies accordingly.

Undoubtedly, our discipline of international studies must conduct in-depth research on the changes and turning points in the international situation, propose new viewpoints, make new summaries, and form new theories to adapt to the needs of China's reform, opening up, and modernization construction.

In short, it is time to seriously consider and make a correct and systematic theoretical understanding of some fundamental issues of the contemporary world. Whether for the development of the discipline of international studies itself, or for the great practice of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, this is extremely important and urgent.

　　正确认识国际形势的新变化
    宦乡
    二次大战以后，世界形势发生了巨大而深刻的变化。诸如国际关系中确立了雅尔塔体制，现在又演变为一个世界、两种制度、政经多极、竞争共处的格局；人类历史上出现了超级大国这种新现象；一系列社会主义国家的出现和第三世界的崛起，大大缩小了资本主义的阵地；传统资本主义发展为现代资本主义；现实社会主义也在许多方面越出了经典作家的设想；世界经济取得了空前的大发展；新科技革命的兴起，对人类社会的发展和国际关系的变化具有深远影响；和平与发展代替了战争与革命成为当代世界的主题，等等。
    客观现实的变化是如此明显，但是我们在过去一个很长时间，由于“左”的指导思想，却一直囿于陈旧的观念，对形势不能作出准确的估计，影响到实践中也不能不出现某些偏差和失误。党的十一届三中全会以后，中央提倡解放思想；进行拨乱反正，对世界形势逐渐有了实事求是的清醒认识，并确定进一步坚持独立自主的外交政策，实行对外开放，扩大国际交往，不断调整和完善外交政策及措施。在这种情况下，国际问题的研究也出现了重大转机，有了迅速的开展。但是总的看来，探索和讨论还不够活跃，对当代世界一些基本问题还缺乏深入研究，没有及时作出系统的理论概括，甚至仍然拘泥于某些陈旧的观念。这当然不能完全说成是学术界本身的问题。不过无论如何，国际问题研究没有很好跟上形势的发展，显得有点落后，恐怕是难以否认的事实。
    实际比理论强。世界正在经历着急剧的变化。进入８０年代中叶，国际形势又出现新的转折。世界各大国经济政治发展的不平衡，导致它们实力地位和世界格局的明显变化，主要表现在美苏实力的显著下降和多极化趋势的迅速发展，特别是日本实力的显著上升。这种实力的消长和地位的升降还在继续。因此，战后以来对国际关系一直起决定性作用的美苏关系已发生重大变化，从表现为军事对抗形式的军备竞赛和地区争夺，转变为对话和“对危机进行管理”形式的对抗，着重于综合国力的全面竞争。随着美苏关系的缓和，世界将进入一个较长时期约为１０到１５年以上的相对缓和阶段。而在这个时期，全球性的政治和军事对抗在国际事务中的影响将逐渐减弱，经济技术方面的竞争则日趋激烈。在某种意义上可以说，军备竞赛和军事安全正退居第二位，经济竞争和经济安全变成第一。各国更加重视本国经济技术的发展，为争取２１世纪的战略地位作准备，因而都在加紧进行调整和改革。但是由于世界经济几个严重失衡一时难于解决，调整和改革尚需时日，因此，估计今后１０年，世界经济还走不出低速发展阶段。不过，随着世界范围的调整改革的进展和技术革命的重大突破，下世纪初可能出现又一次世界经济大发展的时期。
    在国际竞争的重点日益转向经济技术领域的情况下，与全球的国际化和相互依存迅速发展的同时，集团化正成为世界经济发展的一个不可逆转的趋势。北美自由贸易区、欧洲共同体的统一市场、日本积极推行但尚待最后形成的亚太经济圈、原有的经互会组织，成为世界经济竞争中的四大集团，竞争的重点，一是争夺技术领先地位，一是争夺出口市场。世界各国一方面在设法适应国际化的发展，一方面在准备应付日益激烈的竞争和各种形式的保护主义。今后决定各国世界地位的将不是军事上的大战，而是经济技术方面的“大战”。
    当然，也不能忽视问题的另一面。虽然美苏间的军备竞赛和地区争夺都在降温，出现了进一步裁军和政治解决一些地区冲突的趋势，但是美苏关系的缓和也有其脆弱性。这除了制度不同外，主要还由于双方互为对手的战略格局尚无根本变化，加上利益冲突、历史积怨、互不信任，以及可能的偶发事件，特别是军备竞赛向更高层次的发展。因此还有可能出现反复和曲折，不能只看到缓和的一面，而过分乐观，放松警惕。但是美苏对抗的减弱和世界形势走向缓和，毕竟将是今后一个时期的主要趋势。这点几乎已成为世界各国的共识，并且各国都在据此调整内外政策，修订发展战略。
    毫无疑问，我们的国际问题学科，也必须对国际形势出现的这种变化和转折，进行深入研究，提出新的观点，作出新的概括，形成新的理论，以适应我国改革、开放和现代化建设的需要。
    总之，现在是应该认真地考虑和作出对当代世界一些基本问题的正确的系统的理论认识的时候了。无论对于发展国际学科本身，还是对于建设有中国特色的社会主义的伟大实践，这都是非常重要和极为迫切的。
