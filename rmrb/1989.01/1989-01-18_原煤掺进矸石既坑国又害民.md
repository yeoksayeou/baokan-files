Recently, I went to Liguo Township in Tongshan County of our province on a business trip. I discovered that some villagers in Wuzhuang Village were crushing gangue. Some people were mixing the crushed gangue with raw coal and loading it onto two large trucks for transportation outside. The license plate numbers of these two trucks are 65-50007 and 65-50532.

　　原煤掺进矸石既坑国又害民
    最近我去我省铜山县利国乡出差，发现这个乡吴庄村一些村民正在粉碎矸石，有些人将碎矸石与原煤掺合后，装上两辆大卡车外运。这两辆卡车的车号分别是６５—５０００７、６５—５０５３２。
