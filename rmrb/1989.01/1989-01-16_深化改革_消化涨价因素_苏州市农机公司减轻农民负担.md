The Suzhou City Agricultural Machinery Company strictly adheres to price policies, provides high-quality service, and goes all out to reduce the burden on farmers. In recent years, it has been consecutively rated as an advanced unit for quality service in the agricultural machinery system of Jiangsu Province and a civilized unit in Jiangsu Province.

Last year, when the trend of price increases swept through society, the price leadership group, composed of the company's leaders, heads of various business departments, and price inspectors, strictly controlled prices. Nearly ten thousand items in the company did not experience arbitrary price increases or extra charges. To support the municipal Party Committee and government's deployment of agricultural modernization pilot projects, the company vigorously promoted two key machines: the Guilin No. 2 combine harvester and the rice transplanter introduced from Yanji. In the sales process, the company waived the management fees it was entitled to, benefiting farmers by 180,000 yuan in two batches.

While striving to reduce the burden on farmers, the company faced difficulties due to increased procurement costs and various expenses caused by price increases. Suzhou Agricultural Machinery Company focused on deepening enterprise reforms and tapping into the company's internal potential to resolve this contradiction. This year, the company implemented a system where wages are linked to economic benefits, and it divided the accounting units into smaller units. It optimized the labor force by combining recruitment and bidding. All employees actively sought ways to expand procurement channels and increase the variety of products, aiming to win the market through thin-profit, high-volume sales, and high-quality service. As a result, not only were the price increases absorbed, but the per capita tax and profit creation also exceeded 100,000 yuan for the first time, an increase of 33,060 yuan compared to the same period last year, ranking first among the 13 municipal-level agricultural machinery companies in the province.

　　深化改革　消化涨价因素
    苏州市农机公司减轻农民负担
    本报讯  苏州市农机公司严格遵守物价政策，搞好优质服务，千方百计减轻农民负担，近年连续被评为江苏省农机系统优质服务先进单位、江苏省文明单位等。
    去年，当社会上刮起涨价风时，苏州市农机公司由公司领导、各业务科长及物价员组成的物价领导小组严把物价关，全公司近万种商品无一乱涨价乱收费。为了配合市委、市政府农业现代化试点部署，大力推广两种关键机器：桂林２号联合收割机和从延吉引进的插秧机，该公司在销售中还免收应得的管理费，两批共让利给农民１．８万余元。
    在努力减轻农民负担的同时，公司面临着因涨价因素造成的进货和各项费用增加的困难局面。苏州农机公司把解决这一矛盾的着眼点放在深化企业改革，努力挖掘公司内部潜力上。今年以来，实行了工资总额和经济效益挂钩的办法，划小承包核算单位；优化劳动组合，实行招聘和招标相结合。全体职工积极想办法拓宽进货渠道，增加经营品种，以薄利多销、优质服务赢得市场。结果不仅消化了涨价因素，而且人均创税利首次突破１万元，比去年同期增加３３０６元，在全省１３家市级农机公司名列前茅。　　　　　　　　　　　　　（沈石声）
