The development of China's aerospace technology has also seen significant contributions from military surveying and mapping researchers. Today, Wang Renxiang, Director of the General Staff Surveying and Mapping Institute, revealed that by the end of 1988, in response to the needs of China's space technology development, they had completed five major scientific research projects, all of which have reached advanced world levels.

Wang Renxiang, the Director, said that these five research achievements include the overall design of a certain type of experimental satellite, the precise determination of the geocentric coordinates of launch sites and measurement control stations, the calculation of the splashdown point of launch vehicles, and the timely discovery of splashdown debris. Real-time monitoring and command of space-flying objects are crucial in aerospace technology. The General Staff Surveying and Mapping Research Institute, together with the Purple Mountain Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, developed the "satellite dynamic geodesy method." This method achieved a precision of meters in determining the geocentric coordinates of launch sites and dozens of measurement and control stations across the country, playing a significant role in ensuring that China's aerospace measurement and control technology ranks among the world's best. This achievement won the 1987 National Science and Technology Progress First-Class Award.

Established in January 1959, the General Staff Surveying and Mapping Research Institute has achieved 245 scientific research results over the past 30 years, with 63 of them leading domestically or reaching advanced international levels.

Wang Renxiang, the Director, said that since the 1980s, the institute has introduced advanced technologies such as lasers, microwaves, optoelectronics, and computers into the field of surveying and mapping. They have developed various high-precision instruments and, while completing military surveying and mapping research, have applied many of these achievements to national economic construction, achieving good results. The relevant departments of the State Council designed a high-voltage transmission project from Datong to Beijing. The General Staff Surveying and Mapping Research Institute used the "digital mapping instrument" to find a shortcut between the two places, increasing work efficiency by 4 to 5 times and saving 250,000 yuan per 100 kilometers. Shanghai decided to lay water pipes under the Huangpu River using the top-down method. The 1,200-meter-wide riverbed distance required that the misalignment of the two ends of the pipes not exceed 30 centimeters; otherwise, the project would fail. The institute used its own research achievement, the "laser pointing device," to operate with a misalignment of only 10 centimeters, receiving praise from the Shanghai Municipal Government.

　　服务于航天技术和经济建设
  　总参测绘所五项成果国际领先
    新华社北京１月２０日电（中央人民广播电台记者王友齐、新华社记者熊铮彦）中国航天技术发展的丰碑上，同时镌刻着军事测绘科研人员的业绩。总参测绘技术所所长王任享今天透露，截至１９８８年底，适应我国发展空间技术需要，他们已完成５项重大科研项目，全达到世界先进水平。
    王任享所长说，这５项科研成果，包括某种试验卫星总体设计、发射场和测量控制站地心坐标精确测定、运载火箭溅落点的测算和溅落物的及时发现等。对太空飞行物进行实时监测和指挥，是航天技术中的重要一环。总参测绘研究所与中国科学院紫金山天文台一起研制出了“卫星动力测地法”，使发射场和遍布全国的几十个测控站的地心坐标测定达到米级精度，对保证我国航天测控技术跻身世界先进行列起了重大作用。这项成果获１９８７年国家科学技术进步一等奖。
    成立于１９５９年１月的总参测绘研究所，３０年来取得科研成果２４５项，其中６３项在国内处于领先地位或达到国际先进水平。
    王任享所长说，８０年代以来，这个研究所把激光、微波、光电、电脑等先进技术引入测绘领域，研制出多种高精尖仪器，在完成军事测绘科研的同时，把许多成果转向了为国民经济建设服务，收到很好效益。国务院有关部门设计从大同到北京的超高压输电工程。总参测绘研究所运用“数字测图仪”成果，找到了两地之间的捷径，使工效提高４至５倍，每百公里节约经费２５万元。上海市决定在黄浦江底用顶管方法铺设自来水管道，１２００多米宽的江底距离，两头管子接口误差不得超过３０厘米，否则工程就要报废。这个所运用自己的科研成果“激光指向仪”操作，误差只有１０厘米，受到上海市政府表扬。
