		Listening to the Sound of the Tides
		— A Review of the Cassette Tapes "China Tide" and "Hand in Hand"
		Gù Tǔ

		The day the "China Tide Reportage Literature Contest and Awards" concluded was the same day the "China Tide Night" music concert, which stirred up the music industry, began at the Capital Stadium. "Pan Gu opened the sky, mist locked the earth, this is when you appeared, the myths and legends of Shennongjia... The stars and the Big Dipper move, entering a new century, this is when you awoke, the vitality of Shennongjia..." The heavy and exhilarating call had made countless listeners feel a heart-wrenching sorrow and shock. Unexpectedly, a cassette tape "China Tide" (edited by Wú Hǎigǎng and Chén Guórùi), which compiled the best pieces from the concert, appeared before us, entering the broadest and most popular cassette culture market today.

		In this era of surging tides, everyone has experienced the impact of wave after wave, and it is precisely in these impacts that we have taken steps forward, marching towards the distant horizon. The "China Tide" encompasses various economic, cultural, and political tides. To be more specific, it includes the tide of people leaving the country, the tide of doing business, the tide of special economic zones, which have caused the entire society to experience ethical, value, and faith crises. It also includes the tide of popular music, which has finally opened up channels for people's spiritual and emotional expression. Although the tides often overflow, they have washed away the centuries-old concepts of living that have been deeply ingrained in our hearts. The focus of the "China Tide" cassette tape seems to be using songs, the most expressive form of folk emotions, to radiate these great tides and currents into society. From the ancient Shennongjia to the bustling cities of today, from the Yellow Plateau to the endless Yangtze River, from the vast land to the eager heart of a young student. When listening to the songs, it is no longer just about listening to music; instead, it extends our vision, allowing us to see through this chaotic life and re-examine our souls that are being squeezed.

		"China Tide" stands out in the current environment where pirating and counterfeiting are rampant, adhering to the principle of original creation. It compiles entirely new works into tapes, bringing a breath of fresh air to the somewhat murky cassette market. The publication of cassette tapes is welcomed by society and has significant economic benefits, leading to the current situation where publishers are flocking to the market, and cassette tapes are everywhere. This phenomenon is not necessarily bad. However, the question of how to publish and how to profit has different levels. Many publishing houses, in pursuit of quick profits, often plagiarize and patch together works, hastily recording them in a few days and releasing them to the market. They even arbitrarily alter works, disregarding the authors' rights and the mental health of consumers. While they make huge profits, the editorial integrity and the quality of the publishing houses have dropped to a chilling level.

		The cassette tape "Hand in Hand" (edited by Lǐ Pèilán and Guān Hànzhì) shows us another kind of freshness and comfort from a different angle. Although all the songs in this tape are foreign, they are performed by Chinese singers and recorded and produced by the publishing house itself. The editors have their own thoughts and style in arranging and selecting, meaning that a true publishing work has been brought to the world. Unlike some cassette tapes on the current market, which either borrow foreign works and add vulgar lyrics or pirate foreign tapes and piece them together into a tape. In cassette production, performing and using foreign songs is an important part, but it should have its own editorial style and be the result of one's own labor. This concept is particularly important now that copyright law is about to be established and copyright awareness is increasing.

		Of course, the two works "China Tide" and "Hand in Hand" are not entirely satisfying. The effect of "Hand in Hand" is far from being as moving as it was at the Seoul Olympics, seemingly singing just for the sake of singing, with weak emotional colors. "China Tide" has too much of a jumping feeling between each piece, and the overall musical impression is inferior to the lyrics. Some of the melodies are not excellent, and the techniques seem familiar. Many passages in the lyrics also feel like they are "borrowed" from other songs, and some, although simple and familiar, are bland and lack refinement and rhythm.

### 倾听浪潮声——评盒式录音带《中国潮》和《手拉手》

　　倾听浪潮声
    ——评盒式录音带《中国潮》和《手拉手》
    顾土
    令文学界瞩目的“中国潮报告文学征文评奖”结束之日，正是引起音乐界一阵骚动的“中国潮之夜”音乐会在首都体育馆放歌之时。“盘古开天迷雾锁大地
　这才有了你　神农架的神话和传奇　星转斗移，跨入新世纪　这才有了你　神农架的苏醒和活力……”沉重而亢奋的呼唤，曾让万千听众感受到撕心裂肺般的哀恸和震动。不想这么快，一盒荟萃音乐会精品的磁带《中国潮》 （吴海岗、陈国瑞编辑）又展现在我们面前，走进了眼下最广阔也是最受欢迎的磁带文化市场。
  在我们这个浪潮起伏的岁月里，人人都经受着一次次浪潮的冲击，而恰恰又是在冲击中才迈开了步伐，向远方跋涉。中国潮涵盖的是形形色色的经济潮、文化潮、政治潮，说得更具体些，还有使整个社会产生了伦理、价值、信仰恐慌的出国潮、经商潮、特区潮，也有终于疏导出人们精神和情绪宣泄渠道的流行音乐潮。潮水尽管常常漫溢，但却冲荡了千百年积淀在我们内心的处世观念。《中国潮》盒式录音带的焦点，似乎就是在用歌曲这种最能表现民众情绪的文化形态，来向社会放射出这些大潮大汐。从远古的神农架咏到当代喧嚣的都市，从黄土高原唱到滔滔不息的长江，从茫茫苍苍的大地吟到一个少年迫切求学的心灵。听歌时，已不是在听歌，而是延伸我们的目光，看穿这迷乱的生活，重新审视我们正受挤压的灵魂。
    《中国潮》在目前扒带、盗版成风的环境下，独标创作的宗旨，以全新的创作作品编辑成带，给已经有些浑浊的磁带市场吹进了一股清风。出版磁带受社会欢迎，经济效益也颇显著，故而形成如今出版商蜂起，磁带遍地的局面。这样的现象并非坏事。然而如何出版，怎样盈利，却有高低之分。现在许多出版单位为了急速获利，常常是东摘西抄，七拼八凑，几天就胡乱录制成作品，投放市场，甚至将作品肆意篡改，置作者的权益、消费者的心灵健康于不顾。利固然是大赚特赚，但编辑品格、出版单位的品位却低得令人不寒而栗了。
    《手拉手》（李佩兰、关汉喆编辑）这盒磁带从另一方面让我们领略到了一种清新，获得一种安慰。这盒作品虽然全部演唱的是外国歌曲，但却是由中国歌手演唱，由出版社自己录音制作，编辑在编排、选择时有自己的思想和风格，也就是说，是让一盒真正的出版作品问世。而不是像目前磁带市场上的一些磁带那样，或是借用外国作品的曲自己乱编些庸俗不堪的词；或是从国外磁带上乱扒成品，拼凑成带。在磁带生产中，演唱、录用外国歌曲是一个很重要的部分，但这应该具有自己的编辑风格，经过自己的劳动而成。这种观念在版权法即将建立、版权意识日益加强的现在，至为重要。
    当然，《中国潮》和《手拉手》两部作品，也并不能令人十分满足。《手拉手》的效果远不如在汉城的世界奥运会上那样动人心魄，似乎是在为唱歌而唱歌，感情色彩淡薄。《中国潮》中的每部作品之间的跳跃感太强，音乐的总体印象逊于歌词，有的作品的曲调实在称不上佳作，技法似曾相识。而歌词中的不少段落也非上乘，有从其它歌曲中“借”来的感觉，有的虽然浅近亲切却平白无味，缺少精炼和韵律感。
