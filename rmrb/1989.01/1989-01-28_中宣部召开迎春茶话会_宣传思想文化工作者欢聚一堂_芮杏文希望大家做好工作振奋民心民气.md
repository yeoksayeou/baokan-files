The Central Propaganda Department held a spring tea gathering for propaganda, ideological, and cultural workers today. Rúi Xìngwén, on behalf of the Party Central Committee, used a cup of tea to express his New Year's greetings to comrades and friends from the literary and artistic circles, theoretical circles, educational circles, and news and publishing circles across the country.

In his speech, Rúi Xìngwén also expressed his hopes for the broad propaganda, ideological, and cultural workers: to adhere to the principle of "one hand grasping the development of socialist commodity economy and the other hand grasping the work in the ideological and political fields," to fully give play to the Party's political advantages, to further unify the Party's understanding with the theory, line, and economic development strategy of the Thirteenth National Congress, to boost morale and spirit, and to provide a strong ideological and political guarantee for the implementation of the various tasks proposed by the Third Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee.

He believed that first, we should deepen the education on the situation. The education on the situation should be combined with the current reality to re-educate the broad cadres and masses on the line of the Thirteenth Congress, the general policies and guidelines of reform and opening up. Through this education, we should help the broad cadres and masses to correctly understand the achievements and problems of the reform, to understand why we need reform, how to carry out the reform and the complexity and arduousness of the reform, to concentrate forces, enhance confidence, boost spirits, and turn the implementation of the decisions of the Third Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee into conscious actions. Second, we should do a good job in theoretical work, strengthen theoretical construction, arm the whole Party with the theory of the Thirteenth Congress, and at the same time, continuously sum up the new experiences of reform practice, expand and enrich the theory of the Thirteenth Congress. Theoretical work should face the reality of construction and reform, correctly explain and answer the ideological questions of the masses. At the same time, it should serve the deepening of the reform. Third, we should vigorously strengthen the construction of socialist spiritual civilization. The construction of socialist spiritual civilization first needs to establish a firm belief in the minds of the people across the country, which is "to realize the four modernizations and revitalize China." This is not only our historical mission but also the spiritual pillar that unites the strength of the people across the country. We should not only develop the commodity economy and implement the distribution according to work, but also advocate the spirit of dedication, so that the whole society can form a good spiritual style. He hoped that everyone would grasp the legal and institutional construction in the fields of propaganda, ideology, and culture. At the same time, we should strengthen the construction of the propaganda, ideological, and cultural work teams. He also hoped that everyone would cooperate with the commemorative activities of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation and the 70th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement, and do a good job in propaganda, ideological, and cultural work.

In his speech at the tea gathering, Wang Rěnzhī, Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, said that in 1988, our country's political life, economic life, and social life have undergone new changes and made new progress. Propaganda, ideological, and cultural work has also achieved new results. The broad propaganda, ideological, and cultural workers have consciously grasped and propagated the theory, line, and guiding principles of the Thirteenth Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, making active contributions.

Wang Rěnzhī, in expressing his hopes for propaganda, ideological, and cultural work in the new year, stressed that we are at an important historical moment. Reform and opening up and modernization construction urgently need strong theoretical guidance and support. The people of all ethnic groups who are forging ahead need a powerful spiritual driving force. Propaganda, ideological, and cultural workers are shouldering the glorious and arduous historical responsibility.

Some comrades from the literary and artistic circles, news circles, publishing circles, theoretical circles, and educational circles also spoke at the meeting.
