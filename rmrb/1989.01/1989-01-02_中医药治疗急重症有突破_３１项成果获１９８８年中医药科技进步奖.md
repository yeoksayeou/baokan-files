The State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine recently announced the results of the 1988 TCM Science and Technology Progress Awards.

A total of 31 achievements were awarded, with notable progress in the treatment of critical illnesses using traditional Chinese medicine and new technologies for Chinese herbal medicine processing.

One of the three first-place awards was given to Nanjing University of Traditional Chinese Medicine and other institutions for their work on "Clinical and Experimental Treatment of Hemorrhagic Fever with Epidemic Hemorrhagic Fever Syndrome Using Traditional Chinese Medicine." Over more than a decade of clinical practice, they treated 1,127 cases of wild rat-type patients (a type of acute infectious disease with rapid onset and severe symptoms), reducing the mortality rate to 1.11% (compared to 5.08% in the control group) and achieving a recovery rate of 97.8% (compared to 92.6% in the control group). Their treatment methods were innovative and effective.

One of the 19 second-place awards was given to Beijing Jishuitan Hospital and other institutions for their development of the Push-Button Meridian Therapy Device, which was used to treat 410 cases of gallstones. This device combines meridians, acupoints, massage techniques, and electronic technology, allowing for direct monitoring under ultrasound guidance to achieve a total effective rate of 92.7% and a complete stone clearance rate of 17.3%. It also showed significant efficacy in treating gallstone complications.

Experts in traditional Chinese medicine and integrated traditional and Western medicine unanimously agreed that this first science and technology progress award evaluation by the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine emphasized adherence to the theoretical system of traditional Chinese medicine while encouraging and affirming the use of modern scientific methods and tools, as well as innovation.

    获奖成果有３１项，其中中医药治疗急重症、中药加工新工艺研究成绩突出。
    南京中医学院等单位完成的“中医药治疗流行性出血热的临床和实验”，是三项一等奖成果之一。他们经过１０余年临床实践，观察治疗了１１２７例野鼠型患者（一种发病急、症状严重的急性传染病），使病死率降至１．１１％（对照组为５．０８％），越期率达到９７．８％（对照组为９２．６％）。在治法上有所创新，疗效可靠。
    １９项获得二等奖的成果之一——北京积水潭医院等单位完成的推按运经仪，治疗胆囊结石４１０例。它将经络、腧穴、按摩手法与电子技术结合起来，在Ｂ超的直接监视下进行总攻排石，使总有效率达９２．７％，排净率达１７．３％，对胆石合并症也有显著疗效。
    对这次国家中医药管理局成立以来首次评审科技进步奖，中医药专家和中西医结合专家的一致认识是：既强调遵循中医药理论体系指导，又鼓励和肯定应用现代科学方法和手段，并有所创新。
