The Guizhou Provincial Workers' Palace of Culture, built in the early 1950s, would have lost its charm by the 1980s if it relied solely on "speaking, singing, playing, and performing" to provide services. This cultural activity center for workers across the province has now shifted its focus from "small culture" to "big culture," expanding its services from single artistic performances to the economic sector.

Reform has given enterprises autonomy but has also led to some blind spots. In the current situation where administrative management by the government has been weakened and corporate governance is not yet perfect, there is a need for an intermediary organization that can adjust industrial and product structures and provide effective services both internally and externally. The thoughts of some economists inspired the Guizhou Provincial Workers' Palace of Culture. In January 1988, with the support of the Guizhou Provincial and Guiyang Municipal leaders, the Culture Palace established the "Guiyang Region Factory Directors and Managers Association," beginning its attempt to extend cultural services into the economic realm.

The director of Guizhou Casting and Pressing Factory, Han Zhongzhi, joined the association and immediately complained to the Culture Palace: steel is a hot commodity for "official speculators," and the factory cannot operate without it, but now they are already "eating next month's grain"! Unexpectedly, a few days later, the steel inventory from Factory 3326 was delivered to Director Han. It turned out that the Culture Palace had facilitated the communication and provided the convenience free of charge.

In early summer, the Guiyang region faced a power shortage, and the power supply department implemented a phased power outage to alleviate the urgent situation. Guizhou Aluminum Factory suffered an economic loss of 60 million yuan due to power outages, and Director Sun Shengjun urgently sought help from the Culture Palace. A few days later, leaders from the power supply department and famous calligraphers and painters, invited by the Culture Palace, visited the aluminum factory to offer condolences and witnessed firsthand the large amount of electrolytic aluminum that was scrapped due to power outages. The leaders of the power supply department immediately decided that the aluminum factory would no longer be within the power outage range. Once, during a liaison evening held by the Culture Palace, the director of Guizhou Electrical Appliance Factory and the director of Guizhou Aluminum Factory reached a one-year supply contract on the spot. The director of the Electrical Appliance Factory signed the contract and said excitedly, "I never thought that the aluminum ingot material, which we spent a lot of money on but couldn't solve, was resolved so easily on the dance floor."

		A small newspaper connects supply and demand

Indeed, due to the lack of regulation in supply and demand relationships, the exploitation by "official speculators," and the constraints of "relationship networks," enterprises have faced many unnecessary troubles, making problems that could be solved become complicated. In light of this, the Culture Palace decided to timely collect information on domestic and international scarce raw materials, supply and sales, and timely statistics on surplus and urgently needed materials from member factories, and publish them periodically in the "Factory Directors and Managers Information Guide." Currently, through this form, more than a dozen factories and mines have solved their raw material difficulties. For many years, the debt and credit relationships between factories and mines in the Guiyang region have been quite chaotic. To ensure that long-overdue funds can be quickly used for production, the Culture Palace established a "Debt and Credit Company" to take on the responsibility of clearing debts and credits. In the past half year, the debt and credit issues of more than 30 enterprises have been resolved.

		A "thought salon" that consolidates the spirit of reform

The Culture Palace, which used to focus on workers as the main activity, is now often surrounded by entrepreneurs. The colleagues at the Culture Palace felt that high-level strategic services must keep up. They have invited economists to sit down with entrepreneurs six times to discuss enterprise development strategies and explore new trends in economic development. In the "Factory Directors and Managers Information Guide" and "Guizhou Collective and Individual Economy News" published by the Culture Palace, columns such as "Management Research," "Enterprise Forum," and "Contract Analysis" have become theoretical battlefields for entrepreneurs to discuss reforms and management. Entrepreneurs feel that theoretical research not only solves production problems but also improves their own qualities. They compare the Culture Palace to a "thought salon" that consolidates the spirit of reform.

To promote the development of an outward-looking economy, in early 1988, the Culture Palace established a Public Relations Department, training more than 400 people in Guiyang in public relations. By the end of the year, the Culture Palace sent the first public relations team in the province to participate in the "National First Public Relations Miss and Mister Awards," winning three trophies and doing excellent publicity for the products of Maojiong Liquor Factory and Xifeng Liquor Factory entering Southeast Asia and Hong Kong and Macau.

The relatively closed Guizhou business community has begun to open its doors and windows.

Recently, Zhuhai Television Station set up a correspondent office and branch office in this Culture Palace, and it is expected that more than a dozen products will enter the world market through this channel this year.

Now, the Guizhou Provincial Workers' Palace of Culture is influential in both the province and the city. The workers' cultural industry actively serves the changing economic base, finds its new position, and achieves long-term service effects.

This is the new achievement of the Guizhou Provincial Workers' Palace of Culture in the new situation.

### 企业家的新知己——贵阳市工人文化宫为经济服务纪实

　　企业家的新知己
    ——贵阳市工人文化宫为经济服务纪实
    刘茜
    ５０年代初建起的贵阳市工人文化宫，到了８０年代如果光靠“说、拉、弹、唱”开展服务，显然已失去了魅力。这个全市职工的文化活动中心目前把视角从“小文化”转向了“大文化”，从单一的文艺服务扩展到了经济服务领域。
    　　　　供货合同在歌舞场上拍板
    改革，使企业有了自主权，却也产生了一定的盲目性。在当前政府行政性管理被削弱、企业自治体尚未完善的情况下，政企之间需要一个能调整产业产品结构、对内对外实行有效服务的中间组织。一些经济学家的思考，启发了贵阳市工人文化宫。１９８８年元月，在贵州省、贵阳市领导的支持下，文化宫成立了“贵阳地区厂长经理联谊会”，开始了文化服务向经济领域渗透的尝试。
    贵州铸压厂厂长韩中治刚入会便向文化宫诉苦：钢材是“官倒”的俏货，厂里离了它就得停产，可现在已经是“寅吃卯粮”了！没想几天之后，３３２６厂的库存钢材竟送到了韩厂长面前。原来，是文化宫为他们沟通了信息，无偿提供了方便。
    夏初，贵阳地区电力紧张，供电部门采取分片停电的办法，缓解燃眉之急。贵州铝厂因停电经济损失６０００万元，厂长孙生军急得挥泪向文化宫求援。几天后，供电部门领导和著名书画家受文化宫之邀来到铝厂慰问，亲眼目睹了大量电解铝因停电而报废的现场。供电部门领导当即决定铝厂今后不在停电范围之内。一次，在文化宫举办的联谊晚会上，贵州电器厂厂长与贵州铝厂厂长当场达成了一年的供货合同。电器厂厂长在合同书上签字时，激动地说：“没想到我们花了很多冤枉钱都没解决的铝锭材料，竟在歌舞场上迎刃而解。”
    　　　　一张小报沟通了供需双方
    的确，由于在供需关系尚未理顺，“官倒”的盘剥、“关系网”的制约，给企业带来了很多不必要的麻烦，使本来能解决的问题变得复杂化。有鉴于此，文化宫决定及时搜集国内外紧俏原材料的产供销情况，及时统计各入会厂家的多余物资和急需物资，将其一并定期公布在《厂长经理信息导报》上。目前，通过这一形式解决原材料困难的厂矿已有十几家。多年来，贵阳地区厂矿之间的债权债务比较混乱，为使长期拖欠的资金能尽快用于生产，文化宫成立了“债权债务公司”，承担起清理债权债务的职责。半年多来，已有３０多家企业的债权债务问题得到解决。
    　　　　凝聚改革意识的“思想沙龙”
    过去以工人为活动主体的文化宫，现在经常被企业家们包围了。文化宫的同志感到，高层次的战略性服务必须跟上。他们曾先后６次请经济学家与企业家座谈，共商企业发展的战略、研讨经济发展新趋向。在文化宫创办的《厂长经理信息导报》与《贵州集体、个体经济报》上，“管理研究”、“企业论坛”、“承包辨析”等栏目，成为企业家们探讨改革、切磋管理的理论阵地。企业家们感到，理论研究不仅能解决生产问题，也提高了自我的素质。他们把文化宫比作凝聚改革意识的“思想沙龙”。
    为促进外向型经济发展，１９８８年初，文化宫成立公关科，使贵阳市４００多人受到了公关培训。年底，文化宫选送了全省第一支公关劲旅参加“全国首届公关小姐、先生大奖赛”，居然捧回了３个奖杯，并为茅琼酒厂和息烽酒厂的产品进入东南亚及港澳作了极好的宣传。
    比较封闭的贵州企业界开始打开了一扇扇门窗。
    最近，珠海电视台在这个文化宫办起了驻西南记者站和办事处，预计今年将有十几种产品通过这一渠道进入世界市场。
    现在，贵阳市工人文化宫在省里和市里纵横捭阖，举足轻重。职工文化事业主动为变化了的经济基础服务，找到了自己新的位置，取得了服务的长远效应。
    这，正是贵阳市工人文化宫在新形势下的新收获。
