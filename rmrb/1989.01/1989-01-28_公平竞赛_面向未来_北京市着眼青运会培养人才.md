Fair Competition, Facing the Future

Beijing Focuses on Talent Development for the Youth Games

	BEIJING, Jan. 27 (Xinhua) -- Cheating and harassment, which have plagued the international sports arena, are beginning to surface in some major sports events in China. Several incidents occurred during the National University Games, the Agricultural Sports Games, and the City Games last summer and autumn. Today, Ma Guidi, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Sports Commission, briefed the media on Beijing's preparations for this year's Youth Games. He emphasized, "We must compete fairly; cheating is something we can never do."

	Ma Guidi pointed out that sports competitions are also a form of moral and willpower education for young people. It is absolutely unacceptable to violate sports ethics by falsifying age and identity, corrupting young minds, and resisting the erroneous practice of exchanging false glory for local and personal gains.

	In 1985, Beijing suffered a setback at the first National Youth Games, finishing 20th in the gold medal count, which caused a significant stir among the public. Since then, Beijing has established several half-study, half-training sports schools to cultivate reserves, gradually improving the situation of a lack of successors in excellent sports teams. Ma Guidi believes that the main task for Beijing's teams at the second National Youth Games, to be held in September in Shenyang and other cities, is to gain practical experience. They should not be swayed by immediate gains and losses that could disrupt the natural development of sports talents.

	The preliminary competitions for the second Youth Games will begin in March this year. This event will feature 26 competition items.

### 公平竞赛　面向未来  北京市着眼青运会培养人才

　　公平竞赛　面向未来    
    北京市着眼青运会培养人才
    本报北京一月二十七日讯  记者汪大昭报道：在比赛中弄虚作假和骚扰当今国际体坛的种种卑劣手法，正悄悄在我国一些大型运动会上作祟，去年夏秋的全国大学生运动会、农运会和城运会上曾几度造成风波。北京市体委副主任马贵田今天在向新闻界通报北京市参加今年青运会准备情况时说，我们要公平竞赛，作弊的事永远也不能干。
    马贵田指出，体育竞赛对青少年来说，也是品德和意志的教育，绝不容许违背体育道德，利用虚报年龄和身份，腐蚀青少年灵魂，抵制那种用虚假荣誉换取局部和个人利益的错误作法。
    一九八五年，北京市在全国首届青少年运动会上栽了跟头，金牌数排在全国第二十位，在群众中引起很大震动。此后，北京市为改变优秀运动队后继乏人的状况，建立起一批半读半训的运动学校，培养后备力量，青黄不接的现象略有好转。马贵田认为，今年九月在沈阳等地举行的全国第二届青少年运动会上，北京市各代表队的主要任务是实战练兵，不能为计较眼前得失破坏体育人才成长的客观规律。
    第二届青运会各项预赛将于今年三月陆续展开。这次运动会将设有二十六个比赛项目。
