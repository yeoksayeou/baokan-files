	The Soviet Union's foreign ministry issued a statement today, expressing its "welcome and complete support" for Vietnam's decision to withdraw all its troops from Cambodia by the end of September this year.

	The statement also indicated that the Soviet Union will fully support the political resolution of the Cambodian issue.

	The U.S. State Department spokesman, Oakley, said today that the U.S. policy on Vietnam's withdrawal from Cambodia has not changed.

	Earlier, Vietnam had stated that it would withdraw from Cambodia by 1990. Oakley had previously expressed on December 20 that the U.S. is looking forward to Vietnam's complete withdrawal from Cambodia according to an acceptable solution to the Cambodian issue. At that time, the U.S. would be prepared to normalize relations with Vietnam.

	According to estimates by the U.S. State Department, there are currently 90,000 to 100,000 Vietnamese troops in Cambodia.

    美对越撤军立场无变化
    新华社莫斯科１月７日电  苏联外交部今天发表声明，表示“欢迎和完全支持”越南决定今年９月底以前从柬埔寨全部撤军。
    声明表示，苏联将全力支持柬埔寨问题的政治解决。
    新华社华盛顿１月６日电　美国国务院发言人奥克利今天说，美国对越南从柬埔寨撤军问题的政策没有改变。
    早些时候，越南曾表示在１９９０年以前从柬全部撤军。奥克利曾于去年１２月２０日就此表示，美国期待着越南根据一项可接受的柬埔寨问题解决方案从柬全部撤军。到那时，美国准备同越南实现关系正常化。
    据美国国务院估计，目前在柬有９万到１０万越军。
