The Zhumadian region of Henan Province has been diligently implementing a target management responsibility system for party and government cadres, linking the management and evaluation of cadres with economic performance, thereby promoting economic development.

Since 1987, Zhumadian region has been widely promoting the target management responsibility system for cadres at all levels in cities and counties. Last year, various cities and counties further enriched and improved the existing targets, breaking down ten targets including "agricultural water conservancy, science and technology education, per capita income, and poverty alleviation" to various levels of cadres. Responsibility contracts for target management were signed at all levels, forming a four-level target management system from the region, county, township, to the village. The target management system is implemented annually, with a three-year total completion. Cadres who complete or exceed the targets are rewarded with commendations, promotions, etc.; those who fail to complete the targets are demoted, demoted in rank, or even dismissed on the spot.

Since the implementation of the target management responsibility system, cadres at all levels have been aiming at the targets and striving to surpass each other, bringing significant changes to the work of the offices. Since the management targets of cadres are closely linked to economic work, cadres must frequently go deep into the grassroots to solve problems. In the first half of this year, the relevant leaders of the regional government quickly solved 83 problems related to funds, electricity, etc., while conducting on-site office work in enterprises. Runan County insists that township cadres rotate to reside in and take charge of villages each year, actively helping the masses to solve difficulties.

　　优者奖　差者罚　能者上　弱者下
    驻马店地区对干部实行目标管理
    本报讯  河南省驻马店地区认真实行党政干部目标管理责任制，把对干部的管理和考察与经济工作的实绩结合起来，促进了经济发展。
    驻马店地区从１９８７年起在各市、县普遍推行干部目标管理责任制。去年，各市县进一步充实完善原有目标，把“农田水利、科技教育、人均收入及脱贫”等十项目标分解到各级干部，层层签订目标管理责任书，全地区形成地、县、乡、村四级目标管理体系。目标管理制一年一兑现，三年总兑现，完成或超额完成目标，给予记功、升级等奖励；完不成目标，则予以降级、降职直至就地免职。
    目标管理责任制实施后，各级干部瞄准目标，争相赶超，给机关工作带来显著变化。由于干部管理目标密切联系经济工作，干部必须经常深入基层，解决问题。今年上半年地直有关领导在深入企业现场办公中，迅速解决了资金、电力等８３个问题。汝南县坚持乡镇干部每年轮换驻村、包村，主动为群众排忧解难。
