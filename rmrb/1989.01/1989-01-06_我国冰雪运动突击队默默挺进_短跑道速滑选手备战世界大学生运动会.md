The year 1988 has passed, but the sports world is still troubled by the various problems exposed after the Seoul Olympics. Meanwhile, China's ice and snow sports, which should be in full swing during this season, have not attracted much attention. Compared to summer sports, the difficulties in revitalizing ice and snow sports are even greater.

The women's short-track speed skating team, which brought a glimmer of hope to China's ice and snow sports at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Canada, is now gathered at the Capital Gymnasium, silently training hard. Among the ice and snow events, their improvement has been the most significant, and they are the most likely to win medals at the World University Winter Games, which will open in Bulgaria on March 3.

Last year, the International Olympic Committee included short-track speed skating as an official event for the next Winter Olympics. The State Sports Commission subsequently designated short-track speed skating as a breakthrough for the revival of ice and snow sports. After several years of exploration, China's short-track speed skating training methods and techniques have approached the level of international powerhouses. Today, the women's short-track speed skating team coach, Xīn Qìngshān, told reporters that the team's seven members are currently preparing for the World University Games. Their competitive condition is good, and their physical and technical indicators are significantly better than the same period last year. Moreover, it is no longer the situation from two years ago when Li Jinyan was the sole star, or last year when Li Yan was the lone champion. Young athletes like Zhang Yánméi, Wáng Xiùlán, and Guō Hóngrú have caught up, sharing the burden with the veteran players. He said that over the past year, the team has felt the arduousness of the task and has not missed a single day of training, always maintaining a high sense of urgency. Last winter, only 11 countries participated in the Olympics, but now more than 20 countries have formed teams to train in this event. In Asia, Japan and South Korea are both strong rivals for our team. Undoubtedly, the competition will be even more intense in the future, and our training is like rowing against the current—if we don't advance, we will fall behind.

The Chinese men's short-track speed skating training team was also formed in May last year and has made significant progress under the guidance of Coach Wáng Yǔshí. In October, they participated in the Japanese Real Estate Cup International Competition and achieved a fourth-place finish. Experts say that the physical conditions of our male athletes are not inferior to those of foreign strong teams. If trained properly, they could reach the world level in one or two years, making the men's and women's teams equally competitive.

### 我国冰雪运动突击队默默挺进  短跑道速滑选手备战世界大学生运动会

　　我国冰雪运动突击队默默挺进
    短跑道速滑选手备战世界大学生运动会
    本报北京１月５日讯  记者李北大报道：１９８８年已过，体育界仍在被汉城奥运会后暴露出的种种问题困扰，而本该在此季节大显身手的我国冰雪运动并未引起人们的关注。比起夏季项目，冰雪项目振兴的难度更大。
    去年在加拿大卡尔加里冬季奥运会上给我国冰雪运动带来曙光的女子短跑道速滑队，此时正集结在首都体育馆，默默地苦练着。在冰雪项目中，她们提高幅度最大，只有她们最有可能在今年３月３日于保加利亚开幕的世界大学生冬季运动会上赢得奖牌。
    去年，国际奥委会将短跑道速滑列为下届冬季奥运会正式比赛项目。国家体委随之也将短跑道速滑作为冰雪运动翻身的突破口。我国短跑道速滑运动经过几年摸索，训练方法和手段接近国际强队的水平。女子短跑道速滑队教练辛庆山今天对记者说，眼下全队７名队员正为世界大学生运动会作准备，竞技状态良好，各项身体素质和技术动作指标明显好于去年同时期。而且，不再是前年依赖李金艳、去年靠李琰那种一枝独秀的局面。张艳梅、王秀兰、郭红茹等年轻队员赶了上来，与老队员共挑大梁。他说，一年来，全队感到任务的艰巨，没有耽误一天训练，始终保持高度紧迫感，去年冬季奥运会仅有１１个国家参赛，而今组队开展这一项目训练的国家已达２０多个。在亚洲，日本和南朝鲜都是我队强劲对手。毫无疑问，以后的竞争更加激烈，我们的训练如逆水行舟，不进则退。
    中国男子短跑道速滑集训队也于去年５月组成，在王雨石教练的指导下进步显著。去年１０月，他们参加日本地产杯国际比赛，取得一个第４名。据行家们介绍，我国男队员的身体条件并不比外国强队的选手差，如训练得当，也有可能在一两年内达到世界水平，男女队并驾齐驱。
