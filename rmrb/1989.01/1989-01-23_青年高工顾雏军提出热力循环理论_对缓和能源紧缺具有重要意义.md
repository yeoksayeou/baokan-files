A thermal cycle theory that can reduce the electricity consumption of refrigerators by 20% to 40%, and that of large-scale refrigeration and air conditioning systems by 30% to 60%, and double the output of thermal fluid power generation (such as thermal power generation), has been proposed by Gu Minjun, a 30-year-old senior engineer at the Chinese Software Technology Energy Engineering Company.

Recently, at a symposium organized by the Ministry of Mechanical and Electrical Industry and the Home Appliance Association of the Ministry of Light Industry, experts concluded that from the perspective of improving energy utilization efficiency and replacing Freon, this theory will make a positive contribution to global energy utilization and environmental protection, and is of great significance in alleviating China's current energy shortage.

This invention also opens up a very practical new path for refrigerators and air conditioning systems to avoid using Freon, which is severely harmful to the human environment. Research results show that the Freon substances used in refrigerators and air conditioners seriously damage the atmospheric protective layer (ozone layer). The consequences will lead to a significant increase in cancer and glaucoma patients, and many organisms will find it difficult to survive. For this reason, in 1987, 31 countries around the world held an international conference in Montreal, Canada, to restrict the use of Freon, signing an agreement to completely ban the use of Freon by 1998. Currently, many developed countries are concentrating their efforts on researching materials and technologies to replace Freon. However, refrigerators and air conditioning equipment using Gu's thermal cycle technology can now avoid using the most harmful Freon substances in the Freon series, F-12.

It is reported that naming a thermal cycle theory after a Chinese scientist is unprecedented. Experts pointed out that theoretically, Gu's cycle is the best thermal cycle for all refrigeration, air conditioning, heat pumps, and thermal fluid cycles, and has great potential to replace all other cycles in these fields. The experts attending the symposium suggested that relevant national departments should pay attention to the technological and economic significance of this achievement and take measures to actively support its development and application.

　　青年高工顾雏军提出热力循环理论    
    对缓和能源紧缺具有重要意义
    本报讯  记者王友恭报道：一种可使电冰箱节电２０％—４０％、大型制冷和大型空调系统节电３０％—６０％、热流体发电（如火力发电）量增加一倍的“顾氏热力循环理论”，已由年仅３０岁的中国软件技术能源工程公司高级工程师顾雏军提出。
    日前，在机械电子工业部和轻工业部家电协会主持召开的论证会上，专家们认为：从能提高能量利用率和替代氟里昂的角度来看，这一理论将会对世界能源利用和环境保护作出积极贡献，对缓和我国能源紧缺的现状具有重要意义。
    这项发明，还为冰箱、空调系统避免使用对人类环境有严重损害的氟里昂开辟了一条十分现实的新路。研究的结果表明，冰箱、空调器中所使用的氟里昂物质对大气保护层（臭气层）有严重的破坏作用。其后果将导致癌症和青光眼患者大量增加，许多生物难以存活。为此，１９８７年，全世界３１个国家在加拿大蒙特利尔召开限制使用氟里昂的国际会议，签署了到１９９８年全面禁止使用氟里昂的协议。目前，许多发达国家正在集中力量研究替代氟里昂的物质和技术。而采用顾氏热力循环技术的冰箱、空调设备，现在就可以不使用氟里昂物质系列中对大气层破坏最严重的Ｆ１２。
    据悉，以中国科学家命名热力循环理论，是有史以来第一次。专家们指出，从理论上可以证明，顾氏循环是所有制冷、空调、热泵及热流体循环中最佳的热力循环，很有希望在这些领域代替所有别的循环。与会专家建议国家有关部门重视这一成果的技术经济意义，并采取措施积极支持它的开发和应用。
