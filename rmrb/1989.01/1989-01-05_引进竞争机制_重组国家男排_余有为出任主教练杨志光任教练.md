The State Sports Commission has announced that the national men's volleyball team is undergoing a reorganization. Former national team coach Yu Youwei has been promoted to head coach, and Yang Zhiguang has been appointed as coach. Both have taken up their positions.

It is understood that this reorganization will introduce a competitive mechanism. 23 players will gather in Beijing for training in mid-January. They come from 14 provinces, municipalities, and military teams, including 6 former national team members. According to Yang Zhiguang, who just arrived in Beijing, after 45 days of winter training, 14 players will be selected to form the national training team. For major competitions, 12 players will be chosen from this group to form the national team.

Both coaches are veterans from the 1970s Chinese volleyball scene and later became coaches. Yu Youwei's Shanghai team and Yang Zhiguang's Hubei team are both top teams in the country. Yu Youwei previously coached in Yugoslavia for two and a half years, and both the club team and the national team he trained showed significant improvement.

　　引进竞争机制　重组国家男排
    余有为出任主教练杨志光任教练
    新华社北京１月４日电  记者薛剑英今天从国家体委获悉，国家男子排球队正在着手重建。原国家男排教练余有为升任主教练，杨志光任教练，他们均已到任。
    据悉，此次国家男排的重建将引进竞争机制。２３名选手将于１月中旬在北京进行集训，他们分别来自１４个省市和部队球队，包括原国家队的６名队员。据今天刚刚赶到北京的杨志光介绍，经过４５天的冬训以后，将从中挑选１４名队员正式组成国家集训队，每逢重大比赛再从中挑选１２名队员组成国家队。
    两名教练都是七十年代我国排坛的骁将，后又几乎同时从事教练工作。余有为训练的上海队和杨志光执掌帅印的湖北队均是国内劲旅。余有为曾在南斯拉夫任教两年半，他所训练的南斯拉夫俱乐部队和国家队均有长足进步。
