The 23-year-old young veterinarian and inspector Liu Zhongliang was killed while upholding principles and enforcing the law during a health inspection at a farmers' market. Recently, the Heilongjiang Provincial Livestock Bureau posthumously recognized Liu Zhongliang as a "Model Veterinary Inspector."

Liu Zhongliang was a veterinary inspector at the Animal Health and Epidemiology Station in Qing'an County, Heilongjiang Province. On the morning of December 12 last year, while performing his inspection duties at the Qing'an Town farmers' market, he discovered that the pork sold by the vendor at stall number 7, Wang Chunbo, had blisters. Liu immediately ordered Wang to stop selling the meat. Instead of heeding the warning, Wang began shouting obscenities and threatened Liu with a knife. Liu stood his ground and argued rationally. Wang's older brother, Wang Chunrui, joined in and attacked Liu. Wang Chunbo then stabbed Liu in the chest with a sharp knife, causing Liu to bleed profusely and die at the scene.

Liu Zhongliang was a member of the Communist Youth League and had been working as an inspector for nearly two years. He always upheld justice, did not show favoritism, and worked diligently.

Currently, the culprit Wang Chunbo is on the run, and the public security authorities are pursuing him.

　　刘忠良秉公执法以身殉职
    新华社哈尔滨１月２７日电（记者彭毅）２３岁的青年兽医检疫员刘忠良在对农贸市场零售猪肉进行卫生检疫时坚持原则，秉公执法，不畏强暴，被歹徒杀害。最近，黑龙江省畜牧局追认刘忠良为“模范兽医检疫员”。
    刘忠良是黑龙江省庆安县兽医卫生防疫站检疫员。去年１２月１２日上午，他在庆安镇农贸市场执行检疫任务时，发现７号摊床主王春波所卖猪肉有痘，当即责令王春波停售。王不但不听劝告，反而破口大骂，持刀威胁。刘忠良毫不畏惧，据理力争。王春波的哥哥王春瑞跳出来殴打刘忠良，王春波用尖刀向刘忠良胸部猛扎，刘忠良当即血如泉涌，以身殉职。
    刘忠良是一名共青团员，担任检疫员近两年，一直秉公办事，不徇私情，勤恳工作。
    目前，凶手王春波在逃，公安机关正在追捕。
