The Shenyang Railway Bureau, by considering the big picture, plugging gaps, and ensuring priorities, successfully completed the transportation of key materials in 1988. Last year, the planned coal transportation exceeded the target by 5.9%; refined oil transportation exceeded the target by 14.9%; timber transportation exceeded the target by 1.9%; and grain transportation exceeded the target by 11.8%.

At the beginning of last year, the tight railway capacity affected all directions, and many people tried to get wagons from the Shenyang Railway Bureau. Bureau Director Li Dajiang strictly controlled the process and did not open any backdoors. The bureau leadership listened to opinions from all sides and decided: wagon allocation must be collectively approved, and the personnel responsible for wagon allocation must be rotated periodically. This stopped 3,010 wagons that were involved in improper transportation, concentrating efforts to ensure the transportation of key national materials.

Northeast China is a major industrial area in the country, with heavy transportation tasks. Any delay in cargo can cause significant losses. The Shenyang Railway Bureau promptly sent personnel to major enterprises, identifying and resolving issues as they arose. In October, the Shenyang Smelting Plant faced a shortage of ore, nearing shutdown. The railway bureau immediately assisted the enterprise in rushing the ore, ensuring production.

The Shenyang Railway Bureau also collaborated with some units to study scientific transportation methods. The Shenyang Transformer Factory produces transformers, each weighing up to 90 tons. However, there were very few concave flatbed wagons for transporting these products, causing a backlog of transformers. The railway bureau and technical personnel worked together to solve this problem. They drained the oil from the transformers and filled them with nitrogen, reducing the weight of the transformers. This allowed 20 transformers to be quickly transported and put into production.

　　顾全大局　堵住漏洞　保证重点    
    沈阳铁路局全面完成重点物资运输任务
    本报讯  沈阳铁路局顾全大局，堵住漏洞，保证了１９８８年重点物资运输。去年统配煤运输超额完成５．９％；成品油运输超额完成１４．９％；木材运输超额完成１．９％；粮食运输超额完成１１．８％。
    去年初，铁路运力紧张的状况影响了四面八方，许多人想方设法到沈阳铁路局搞车皮。局长李大强严格把关，不开后门。局领导听取了各方面的意见，决定：车皮要集体审批，批车皮的人员定期轮换，制止了属于不正当运输的３０１０个车皮，集中力量保证了国家重点物资的运输。
    东北是我国的重工业区，运输任务繁重，货物稍一积压就会造成巨大损失。沈阳铁路局及时派人到各大企业，发现困难及时解决。１０月份，沈阳冶炼厂矿石紧张，濒临停产。铁路局立即帮助企业抢运矿砂，保证了生产。
    沈阳铁路局还和一些单位共同研究科学运输办法。沈阳变压器厂生产的变压器每台重达９０吨，而运输这种产品的凹形平板车极少，造成变压器积压。铁路局和科技人员共同攻关，抽出变压器中的机油，充上氮气，减轻了变压器自重，使２０台变压器很快运出投产。
