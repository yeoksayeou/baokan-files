Leshan City is taking proactive measures to redirect tens of millions of yuan in bonuses from the consumption sector. Preliminary estimates indicate that by the end of 1988, the total bonuses to be paid out to individuals in Leshan City exceeded 20 million yuan. To prevent the consumption fund from expanding further, four counties in the city—Emeishan, Jianwei, Renshou, and Pengshui—have implemented redirection policies. Over 55% of the bonuses have been shifted from the consumption sector to the production sector. On January 21, the Leshan Municipal Party Committee promptly summarized the experiences of these four counties and adopted measures such as phased payouts, collective funding, temporary loans, and converting bonus funds into risk adjustment funds to achieve the redirection of bonuses.

    乐山市实行奖金分流
    乐山市采取积极措施，引导数千万元奖金从消费领域中分流出来。经粗略测算，１９８８年年底乐山全市应该兑现给个人的承包奖和达标奖突破２０００万元。为了防止消费基金再度膨胀，这个市的眉山、犍为、仁寿、彭山四个县采取分流政策措施，使５５％以上奖金由消费领域转向生产领域。１月２１日，乐山市委及时总结了四个县的经验，用分期兑现、集资、暂借和将奖励基金转变为风险调剂基金等办法使奖金分流。
