The Lei ethnic injured soldier Liang Yajiu couple, from Hongsha Town, Sanya City, Hainan Province, has voluntarily taken care of the widowed elderly woman Wu Apop for 25 years, which has become a well-known story in the local area.

Liang Yajiu, who enlisted in 1959, had his left arm amputated in an accident while operating construction machinery. After being discharged from the military, despite his physical disability, he remained determined and actively contributed to the construction of his hometown. When he heard that there was a 70-year-old widowed elderly woman named Wu Apop in the town who was blind and mentally ill, he immediately decided to take her into his home to take care of her. He discussed his plan with his wife, Lu Xiaomei, who was then the town's Communist Youth League branch secretary. She agreed without hesitation. From that point on, the couple took full responsibility for caring for and supporting Wu Apop.

In the scorching summer of Hainan Island, to ensure Wu Apop's comfort, Liang Yajiu and his wife saved money from their meager disability allowance to buy her an electric fan and a radio to keep her entertained. Since Wu Apop was blind, it was inconvenient for her to go to the bathroom, so Lu Xiaomei would always accompany and assist her. Whenever Wu Apop fell ill and was bedridden, Lu Xiaomei would sleep by her side, and it was common for her to help with toileting.

Twenty-five years have passed. Under the careful care of Liang Yajiu and his wife, Wu Apop's mental illness miraculously recovered. When the reporter visited her out of admiration, the 95-year-old Wu Apop stroked our hands and said in broken Mandarin, "I am alive today, all thanks to them."

　　黎族伤残军人梁亚九夫妇风格高
    义务赡养孤老吴阿婆２５年如一日
    本报讯  海南省三亚市红沙镇，黎族伤残军人梁亚九夫妇，２５年如一日，义务赡养孤寡老人吴阿婆，在当地传为佳话。
    １９５９年参军的梁亚九，在一次操纵施工机械时，不慎被折断左臂致残。退伍后，他身残志不残，积极为家乡建设做贡献，当他听说镇上有位叫吴阿婆的七旬孤寡老人双目失明而且精神失常时，当即下决心把这位老人接到家来赡养。他把自己的想法同妻子商量，很快得到了当时担任镇团支部书记的妻子卢小妹的赞同，从此，夫妻俩就把抚养照料吴阿婆的事全部包了下来。
    盛夏的海南岛，热浪袭人。为让吴阿婆生活得舒适，梁亚九夫妇俩省吃俭用，拿出每月用微薄的伤残优抚金积攒起来的钱，为老人买了电风扇和供老人解闷用的收音机。因双目失明，老人上厕所不方便，卢小妹每次都跟随搀扶；如遇老人患病卧床不起，卢小妹便陪睡在身旁，给老人端屎倒尿更是常事。
    转眼２５年过去了。在梁亚九夫妇的精心照料下，吴阿婆的精神失常症竟奇迹般地痊愈了。当笔者慕名前去采访时，９５岁高龄的吴阿婆老人抚摸着我们的手，用生硬的普通话说：“我能活到现在，多亏他们俩啊！”
