On July 15, 1988, the Jinbei stock issued by the Shenyang Automobile Shareholding Co., Ltd. in Liaoning Province was divided into RMB preferred stock and USD common stock. It was also stipulated that the RMB preferred stock could be converted into common stock after five years. Many readers have inquired about the differences between preferred stock and common stock. Here, we invite a colleague from the People's Bank of China to briefly introduce the topic.

Common stock and preferred stock are primarily distinguished by the rights enjoyed by shareholders. Common stock is the most common form of stock, and its most notable feature is that it grants the holder the right to participate in the company's management decisions and the right to distribute profits according to the company's earnings. For example, attending shareholders' meetings, having the right to vote and be elected; the right to sue directors; the right to inspect accounts; the right to receive company profits without limitation (i.e., the dividend level is not subject to any ratio restrictions); the right to receive company residual assets without limitation; and the right to subscribe to new shares.

Preferred stock, on the other hand, is a type of stock that, compared to common stock, gives the holder priority in receiving dividends and distributing company residual assets. Preferred stock typically has a fixed dividend, which is paid out before common stock dividends. In the event of the company's bankruptcy or liquidation, preferred stock holders have priority over common stock holders in claiming the company's residual assets. However, preferred stock holders generally cannot participate in the company's operations and management.

Most preferred stocks can be converted into common stocks after a certain period, and some preferred stocks can be redeemed at any time, while common stocks cannot be converted or redeemed.

From the above differences in rights between preferred stocks and common stocks, it can be seen that since fixed dividends must be paid on preferred stocks regardless of the company's operating conditions, the risk borne by preferred stock holders is relatively small, and their income is relatively stable. In contrast, the dividends on common stocks fluctuate with the company's operating conditions and earnings, making them riskier. However, when the company's operating conditions are good, preferred stock holders only receive dividends at a fixed rate, while common stock holders can obtain the highest profits. Whether to purchase preferred stocks or common stocks depends entirely on the investor's analysis and evaluation of the issuing company.

　　优先股票与普通股票有何不同？
    １９８８年７月１５日，辽宁沈阳市汽车股份有限公司发行的金杯股票，分为人民币优先股票和美元普通股票，并规定人民币优先股票５年后可转为普通股票。许多读者来信询问优先股票与普通股票有什么不同？在此请中国人民银行的同志简单介绍一下。

    普通股票和优先股票主要是按股东享有的权益不同来划分的。普通股票是股票中最普遍的一种形式，它最明显的特征就是同时赋予持有人参与公司经营管理决策的权力和根据公司盈利大小进行分配的权利。如：出席股东大会，有选举权和被选举权。有控告董事权；查帐权；无限制分得公司盈利权（即股息水平不受任何比率限制）；无限制分得公司剩余财产权；优先认股权。
    优先股票是与普通股票相比较而言的一种股票，持有人在取得股息、分得公司剩余财产等方面有优先权。
    优先股票通常有一个固定的股息，并且在普通股票持有人得到股息之前兑现；优先股票持有人在公司破产或清理解散时，对公司剩余财产比普通股票有优先索偿的权力。但优先股票持有人一般不能参加公司的经营和管理。
    大多数优先股票持有一定时期后可兑换成普通股票，有的优先股票还可以随时偿还，而普通股票则不可兑换和偿还。
    从上述优先股票和普通股票所具有的不同权益还可以看出，由于不论公司经营状况好坏都要支付优先股票的固定股息，所以优先股票的持有者承受风险较小，收入也比较稳定。而普通股票的股息随公司经营状况和盈利大小而变动，风险较大。但当公司经营状况好时，优先股票持有人只是按已定的比率获取股息，而普通股票持有人则能获得最高额盈利。购买优先股票还是普通股票完全取决于投资者对发股公司的分析评价。
