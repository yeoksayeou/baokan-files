	Guiyang Implements New Measures to Curb Unregulated Fares in Passenger Transport
	Orders Vehicle Owners to Pay for Apologies in Newspapers

	Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, January 17th — Five individual "minibus" owners in Guiyang who were found to be overcharging passengers wrote letters of apology that appeared in the January 16th edition of the Guiyang Evening News. This is a new measure adopted by the Guiyang Municipal Passenger Transport Management Office to curb unregulated fares in passenger transport.

	In recent years, some individual minibus owners have been overcharging passengers beyond the standard rates, and relevant departments have repeatedly failed to stop this practice, leading to complaints from the public. The Guiyang Municipal Passenger Transport Management Office has decided that starting this year, individual passenger transport operators found to be overcharging will not only be fined according to regulations but will also have to pay to publish an apology in the newspaper to the passengers. Otherwise, their operating licenses will be revoked.

	This measure, which uses social opinion to expose illegal behavior in front of the public, has shaken some of the overcharging vehicle owners. To facilitate supervision, the Municipal Passenger Transport Management Office has also published the fare standards for minibuses in the newspaper. If there are any violations, passengers only need to record the vehicle number and can report it to them at any time.

　　贵阳惩治客运乱收费有新招
    令车主自费登报向乘客道歉
    新华社贵阳１月１７日电  （实习生王松、记者顾筑胜）贵阳５名乱收费的个体“中巴”车主写的检讨书，成了１月１６日《贵阳晚报》头版加框新闻。这是贵阳市社会客运管理处为刹住客运乱收费而采取的新招。
    近年来，一些个体“中巴”车主超标准乱收费，有关部门屡禁不止，群众时有怨言。贵阳市社会客运管理处为此作出决定，从今年起，个体客运乱收费者一经查出，除按规定罚款外，还必须自费登报，向乘客赔礼道歉，否则吊销营运执照。
    这一凭借社会舆论让不法行为在群众面前曝光之举，使一些乱收费的车主受到震动。为便于监督，市社会客运管理处还在报上公布了“中巴”车的收费标准等事项，如有违犯，乘客只要记下车号，便可以随时向他们举报。
