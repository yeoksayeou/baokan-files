China's first tourism airline company, self-financed by the tourism system, was established at the end of 1988 in Nanjing.

The company, affiliated with the Nanjing Municipal Tourism Bureau, was founded to alleviate the shortage of civil aviation capacity and to facilitate the travel of domestic and foreign tourists and businesspeople. With the strong support of the municipal government and the tourism bureau, the company has successively purchased two domestically produced Y-7 aircraft, named "Zijin" and "Zhongshan," respectively. On December 27, 1988, the company opened its first route from Nanjing to Fuzhou. In the future, it will successively open routes to Hangzhou, Xuzhou, Shanghai, Jiujiang, Bengbu, Xi'an, Beijing, Foshan, Xiamen, and Wuyishan (Chong'an).

The company's "flight attendants" not only serve as in-flight service personnel but also act as tour guides, setting a good precedent in both the civil aviation and airline systems.

　　我国首家旅游航空公司问世
    本报讯  我国旅游系统第一家自行集资创办的航空公司１９８８年底在南京宣告成立。
    这家隶属于南京市旅游局的中国联合航空公司南京公司，是为缓解民航运力不足的矛盾，方便国内外游人和客商往来而成立，该公司在市政府和市旅游局的大力支持下，先后购买了两架国产运七型飞机，分别命名为“紫金号”和“钟山号”。１９８８年１２月２７日该公司首次开通南京至福州航班，今后将陆续开辟至杭州、徐州、上海、九江、蚌埠、西安、北京、佛山、厦门、武夷山（崇安）等航线。
    这家公司的“空中小姐”既是随机服务员，又是导游员，在民航和联航系统开创了良好的先例。
