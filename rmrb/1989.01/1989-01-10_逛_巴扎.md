Exploring the "Bazaar"
By Li Chenghua, People's Daily Reporter

"Bazaar" in Uyghur means "market" or "bazaar." I dare say, the number of bazaars in Kashgar City is unmatched in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.

Kashgar is an ancient city on the "Silk Road," once described by historians as having "intersecting streets and bustling markets," "layered buildings, and a flow of horses and carriages." It was one of the earliest international markets in western China. In the ancient bazaars, "rare treasures and exotic goods were often found. Livestock and fruits were innumerable." In this environment, the Uyghur people have long formed a tradition of commerce.

Last September, on a Saturday, we visited the largest bazaar in Kashgar City, the "Kashgar Comprehensive Market," during the peak season for watermelons and Gashi melons (a type of sweet melon). We saw piles of watermelons and Gashi melons almost filling the entire fruit market. Tuerdi Maimaidi, an old man from Gashi County, and his son Abudu Kerimu had brought over a ton of Gashi melons the night before, hiring a large truck to transport them. Therefore, they occupied a prominent spot at the entrance of the bazaar. Tuerdi Maimaidi told me that his family of eight had contracted 20 acres of land, planting 10 acres of wheat, 5 acres of melons, and 5 acres of cotton. I asked, "How is your life?" The Uyghur elder smiled and said, "Good! Very good! During the commune period, we earned only 1 jiao a day. Now, it's different; we earn several yuan a day. We are not worried about food or clothing, eating white flour naan every day, and can often eat mutton."

After bidding farewell to Tuerdi Maimaidi and his son, we walked to a pile of watermelons. Upon inquiry, we found that these watermelons belonged to Naser, Ahong, and Yusup, three farmers from San Village, Atushi Township, Shufu County. These three Uyghur farmers did not grow watermelons themselves but took advantage of the farming off-season to purchase watermelons from the producing areas and sell them at the bazaar. Naser said, "The three of us pooled our resources, and each person can earn four or five hundred yuan during the melon season."

The "Kashgar Comprehensive Market" is also known as the East Gate Bazaar, said to be the largest market in Asia. Apart from agricultural and pastoral products, it also deals in ethnic goods, daily necessities, fabrics, and clothing. It opens every Sunday, and during the farming off-season, the number of visitors can reach 100,000. On such bazaar days, the purchasing volume is around 800,000 yuan, with a transaction volume of 300,000 yuan. To encourage Uyghur farmers to produce more vegetables and fruits, the Kashgar City Administration for Industry and Commerce has stipulated that vegetables and fruits transported to the bazaar, if self-produced and self-sold, will not be charged a market management fee, only a few jiao for the stall fee.

After exploring the East Gate Bazaar, we walked for about 10 minutes and arrived at the Wudali Bazaar. This market specializes in small commodities, with 450 stalls, open every day, and a daily visitor flow of over 10,000. At the stall of the Uyghur man Alai, I pointed to the mirrors, combs, nail clippers, and buttons on the counter and asked, "Where did you get these goods?" Alai replied, "Mostly from Yiwu County, Zhejiang Province, and some from Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou." I then asked, "How is business?" He replied, "Not bad. The money earned can cover the family's living expenses and have some left over." After passing by more than 50 stalls selling small commodities, we stopped at a corner where a stall stood out. This stall was piled with candies, biscuits, pastries, and tea leaves, a food specialty stall. The owner, Maimaidi Tursun, told me that the goods came from Shanghai, Tianjin, and Guangzhou, with very few local products. I asked, "How is the sales volume?" He said, "The sales volume is still good. Now, people's living standards have generally improved, and even some Uyghurs drink high-grade biscuits and pastries with milk tea." After bidding farewell to Maimaidi Tursun, we walked forward and saw more than a dozen stalls specializing in small knives. The stalls were filled with various small knives. These knives were finely crafted, with smooth and shiny blades. Some had gemstone inlays, while others had gold and silver inlays. If you bought one, they would also provide a light and convenient knife sheath. Uyghur knives are both necessary items for daily life and beloved handicrafts. A stall owner named Abudu Maimaidi told me that he had been making knives all along and is now self-producing and self-selling. After passing through the small knife specialty lane, we walked through the clothing lane, turned a corner, and arrived at a lane specializing in boots and hats. Here, there were Uyghur small flower hats and military caps; there were leather shoes and boots that herdsmen liked. Yimin Maimaidi, an old bootmaker, was making and selling boots at his stall. I asked, "How is the sales volume of your boots?" He replied, "As long as it is enough to live on, I have never considered the sales volume."

After exploring the Wudali Bazaar, we crossed a street and arrived at the Anjiang Bazaar. The full name of the Anjiang Bazaar is the "Anjiang Xiest Industrial Products Market." Because it mainly deals in high-end goods, the public has given it a nickname, "Hong Kong Bazaar." The various stalls in the bazaar display all kinds of fabrics, decorations, wedding items, and clothing, truly colorful and dazzling. Most of the stall owners here are Uyghurs, including a few women. Heidinihan told me that she started her business in 1966, doing it secretly at that time, and it was not until 1979 that she officially started her business with a license. After looking at Heidinihan's stall, we squeezed through a few crowds and came to a quieter lane, where we saw a young Uyghur man reading an English textbook next to a stall. He is named Abudu Wuli, 23 years old, and after graduating from high school, he did not get into college and started his own business, becoming an individual trader selling clothing and fabrics. Because Pakistani businessmen and foreign tourists coming to Kashgar all come to the "Hong Kong Bazaar" to buy things, young Uyghur businessmen have started learning English to do business.

Now, there are more than 7,000 people engaged in individual commerce in Kashgar City, of which 85% are Uyghurs. It can be predicted that with further reform and opening up, the number of Uyghur individual businessmen will continue to increase.

### 逛“巴扎”

　　逛“巴扎”
    本报记者  李成华
    “巴扎”在维吾尔语中是“集市”、“市场”的意思。我敢说，喀什市巴扎之多，居新疆维吾尔自治区之首。
    喀什是古代“丝绸之路”上的重镇，曾被史家描写为“街衢交互，厘市纠纷”，“楼房层列，马龙车水”，是我国西部最早的国际市场。在古代的巴扎上，“奇珍异宝，往往有之。牲畜果品，尤不可枚举。”在这种环境的熏陶下，维吾尔族早就形成了经商的传统。
    去年９月初的一个星期六，我们来到喀什市最大的巴扎——“喀什市综合市场”时，正是西瓜、伽师瓜（一种甜瓜）大量上市之际，只见一堆堆如小丘的西瓜、伽师瓜，几乎占满了专门经营瓜果的广场。伽师县四乡七村的吐尔迪·买买提老汉和儿子阿不都·克里木，头天晚上就雇了一辆大卡车，把自家产的一吨多伽师瓜运来，因此他们占了巴扎门内的一块显眼的地盘。吐尔迪·买买提老汉告诉我，他全家８口人，承包了２０亩地，种了１０亩小麦、５亩瓜、５亩棉花。我问：“你们生活怎么样？”这位维吾尔老人笑着说：“好啊，太好啦！公社那个时期，我们干一天只有１角钱。如今可不同了，干一天合几块钱，不愁吃不愁穿，天天吃白面馕，还能经常吃上羊肉。”
    告别了吐尔迪·买买提父子，我们走到一堆西瓜跟前。一打听，这堆西瓜是疏附县阿瓦提乡三村农民纳塞尔、阿訇、玉素甫三人的。这三位维吾尔农民自己没种西瓜，而是利用农闲到产地收购一些西瓜，运到巴扎来出售。纳塞尔说：“我们三个人合资，一个瓜季，每人能赚四五百元。”
    “喀什市综合市场”也叫东门巴扎，据说是亚洲最大的集市。除了农牧产品以外，还有民族用品、日用百货、衣料服装等等，都在这里交易。它每个星期天开集，农闲时的巴扎日有时赶集者高达１０万人次。这样的巴扎日，进货量都在８０万元左右，成交额３０万元。为了鼓励维吾尔农民多生产蔬菜瓜果，喀什市工商行政管理局规定，运到巴扎的蔬菜瓜果，凡是自产自销的，不收市场管理费，只收几角钱的摊位费。
    逛完东门巴扎，步行１０多分钟，我们来到吾达力巴扎。这里专门经营小百货，拥有４５０个摊位，每天都开张，客流量达一万余人次。逛到维吾尔人艾里的摊位前，我指着摆在货摊上的镜子、梳子、指甲刀、扣子等小商品问：“你这些货从哪里进来的？”艾里回答：“主要是从浙江义乌县进来的，也有从北京、上海、广州进来的。”我又问：“生意如何？”他回答：“还好。赚的钱除了能解决全家人的吃穿住用外，还有结余。”走过５０多个清一色摆着小百货的摊位，在转弯处，出现一个与众不同的货摊，我们便停下脚步观看。这个货摊堆放着糖果、饼干、点心、茶叶等食品，是个食品专售摊。货摊主人叫买买提·吐尔逊。他告诉我，货源来自上海、天津、广州，本地产品很少。我问：“销路怎么样？”他说：“销路还可以。现在人们的生活水平普遍提高了，就连我们维吾尔族有些人在喝奶茶时也要吃高档的饼干、点心。”告别买买提·吐尔逊后，往前走，在我们面前出现十几个专售小刀的货摊。货摊摆着、挂着各式各样的小刀。这些小刀做工考究，刀体平滑光亮，有的刀柄镶嵌宝石，有的镶嵌金银。如果你买上一把，还给你配上一个轻巧的刀鞘。维吾尔小刀，既是人们日常生活的必要用品，又是令人喜爱的工艺品。一位名叫阿不都·买买提的摊主告诉我，他一直是制作小刀的，现在是自产自销。穿过小刀专售摊巷，又走过卖服装的摊巷，转过弯，我们来到专门卖靴帽的一条巷子。这里有维吾尔的小花帽，还有军便帽；有皮鞋，还有牧民们喜爱的靴子。依明·买买提老汉是位靴匠，在摊位上现做现卖。我问：“您做的靴子销路怎样？”他答：“够吃够穿就行了，我向来不考虑销路问题。”
    逛完吾达力巴扎，横穿一条大街，来到安江巴扎。安江巴扎的全称为“安江热斯特工业品市场”。因为经营的大都是高档商品，群众送给它一个外号叫“香港巴扎”。巴扎内的各个货摊上陈列着各色各样的衣料、装饰品、结婚用品、服装等，真是五彩缤纷，琳琅满目。到这个巴扎摆摊的大都是维吾尔人，其中还有少数妇女。海日尼沙汗告诉我，她是在１９６６年开始经商，当时是偷偷摸摸干的，直到１９７９年才正式持执照经商。看完海日尼沙汗的货摊，我们挤过几堆人群，来到比较清静的货巷，发现在一个货摊旁坐着的维吾尔小伙子正在读英语课本。他叫阿不都维力，２３岁，中学毕业后没考上大学，自谋职业，成为贩卖服装、衣料的个体户。因为巴基斯坦商人和到喀什的外国旅客都要到“香港巴扎”买东西，为了做生意，年轻的维吾尔商人便学起了英语。
    如今，喀什市从事个体商业的人已达７０００余人，其中８５％是维吾尔人。可以预计，随着进一步改革开放，维吾尔的个体经商户还会增加。
