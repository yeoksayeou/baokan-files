People often use rulers and thermometers to measure length and temperature without any difficulty. However, when it comes to measuring a person's mental activity, it is often found to be quite challenging. This is due to the inherent complexity of mental phenomena, which is far greater than that of physical phenomena. Therefore, exploring the mysteries of the mind is a very difficult task.

A computer diagnostic system capable of quickly detecting and measuring mental illnesses, known as CSPD, has been successfully developed by the Shashi Veterans' Mental Hospital in Hubei Province and the Institute of Mental Health at Beijing Medical University, among other units. The system passed a department-level appraisal today.

The newly developed computer diagnostic system has undergone over 300 clinical tests and has proven to have an accuracy rate of over 90%. In addition to its diagnostic functions, it also includes case management, data processing, and more than a dozen other functions, making it a leading system in the country. It has practical value and is suitable for promotion and application.

　　人的精神活动亦可测量
    精神疾病计算机诊断系统研制成功
    本报北京１月１８日讯  一种能迅速检验和测量人的精神疾病的计算机诊断系统——ＣＳＰＤ，由湖北省沙市复员退伍军人精神病医院和北京医科大学精神卫生研究所等单位联合研制成功，今天通过部级鉴定。
    通常，当人们拿着尺子、温度计去测量长度或温度时，并没有感到有什么不便。然而，当人们欲对某人的精神活动加以测量时，则往往感到十分困难而无从下手。这是由于精神现象具有的本质属性远较物理现象复杂。因此，探索精神奥秘是个非常艰难的课题。新研制的这套计算机诊断系统经３００多例临床检测，证明其准确率在９０％以上。它除具诊断功能外，还有病案管理、数据处理等十几种功能，属国内先进水平，具有实用和推广价值。
