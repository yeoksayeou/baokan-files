Title: Sunset Beach

Sunset, evokes the image of the setting sun, the evening glow, and the leisure that comes after a day of toil. The beach seems always to be bathed in the summer sun. Two equally beautiful and romantic words, sunset and beach, seem never to have met in the mundane and trivial daily life. Sunset Beach, how poetic and charming it must be!

The beach bears the footprints of couples, making me feel that my solitary figure is somewhat out of place with this romantic atmosphere. Never mind, nature always displays its beauty to anyone. Isn't that so? Look at the setting sun in the distance, shrouded by the evening clouds, washing away the heavy makeup and passionate demeanor of noon, warmly waving goodbye to me, yet seeming a bit shy. She holds the veil of clouds, partially covering her face, taking light steps, retreating to the line where the sea meets the sky, but also seeming a bit reluctant, as if afraid to leave me alone on the cold beach.

To be honest, if it weren't for another sunset tomorrow, I too would be reluctant to see her go.

Finally, after leaving the last trace of red on the sea, the sky is left with only a few faint red and purple clouds. In an instant, the surroundings become much quieter.

In this season, the beach is not crowded. But the song of the waves is clear and pleasant, with each wave tenderly kissing the shore. After month after month, year after year, that deep love has not changed at all.

The sky darkens, and it is hard to tell where the sky ends and the sea begins, everything is one color. The grandeur of nature makes me feel how small I am!

The waves' love song continues. I feel embarrassed to eavesdrop any longer, so I quietly walk across the sand, leaving only a trail of footprints, and resolutely walk away.

Sunset Beach, you are too enchanting. If I don't leave now, I won't want to go. Sunset, beach, sunset, beach...

　　黄昏海滩
    〔香港〕施沁
    黄昏，令人想起夕阳、晚霞和一天劳累之后的闲适。海滩似乎总是连着夏日的阳光。两个同样美丽而浪漫的词儿在平凡烦琐的日常生活中好像从未碰在一起过。黄昏海滩，该是多么富有诗意和情趣的啊！
    海滩上印着几行情侣们的脚印，使我不禁觉得自己孤身只影的单薄与这浪漫情调有些不称。管它呢，大自然总是将它的美向任何人展示的。不是吗？看远处那晚霞掩映中的落日，一洗正午的浓装艳抹和热情奔放的性格，亲切地向我挥手道别，但又似乎有些害羞。她挽着霞云的轻纱，半掩娇容，轻移玉步，走回海天相接的一线，但又似乎有点恋恋不舍，好像怕丢下我一个人独坐清冷的海滩。
    说真的，要不是明天又有这样一个日落的美景，我也是舍不得她走的。
    终于，在海面上留下最后一道红霞后，天空中只呈现着淡红、淡紫的几丝微云了。瞬刻间，周围清静了许多。
    本来，这季节的海滩就不多人。但海浪的歌声清晰悦耳，海涛一个接一个亲昵地吻着海滩。经过了一月又一月，一年又一年，那深深的恋情没有一丝儿的改变。
    天阴沉起来，已分不清哪是天哪是海，只觉得海天一色。大自然的宏大衬托出我自己是多么的渺小啊！
    海涛的情歌仍在唱。我不好意思再偷听了，轻轻地走过沙滩，只留下一行脚印，毅然地走远了。
    黄昏海滩，你太迷人了，再不走，我就不会想走了。
    黄昏，海滩，黄昏、海滩……
