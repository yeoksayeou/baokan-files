The first Chen Rong Award named after the pioneer of modern forestry in China was presented to outstanding forestry workers at the seventh session of the Chinese Forestry Society held recently in Xi'an.

Chen Rong was a renowned forester and educator in China, one of the pioneers of modern forestry in the country. The 80-year-old Chen Rong, who suffered severe physical and mental damage during the "Cultural Revolution," still remembered the development of China's forestry industry before his death in 1971. He left a will instructing his son to donate his lifetime collection of over 50 years of books and materials to the library of the Chinese Academy of Forestry, and to donate his accumulated salary and manuscript fees of over 78,000 yuan to the state. To learn from Chen Rong's spirit of loving the motherland and forestry scientific education, diligently studying, and striving to cultivate forestry science and technology talents, and to express condolences to this initiator and leader of the forestry society, the Chinese Forestry Society combined Chen Rong's donation with the nearly 10,000 yuan donated by former honorary chairman Shen Pengfei, Yang Xianjin, and others, into the Chen Rong Memorial Fund. This fund rewards forestry workers who have made outstanding achievements in academic, popular science, suggestions, and society work.

Four categories, including "Current Major Contradictions Affecting China's Forestry Development and Their Countermeasures," "National Forest Paper Joint Verification," and "Suggestions on Reforestation Proportional to Water Resource Fees," totaling 30 items, received the Chen Rong Award.

At the meeting held from January 8 to 12, 97 scientific and technological workers who have been engaged in forestry work for more than 50 years were also commended.

　　以我国现代林学开拓者命名
    首届陈嵘奖授给优秀林学工作者
    本报讯  记者谢联辉报道：日前在西安结束的中国林学会第七届代表会颁发了首届陈嵘奖。
    陈嵘先生是我国著名林学家、教育家，是我国现代林学的开拓者之一。在“文化大革命”中身心受到严重摧残的八旬陈嵘，１９７１年临终前仍不忘祖国林业事业的发展，留遗嘱令儿子将其毕生５０余年所珍藏的图书、资料捐献给中国林业科学院图书馆，将其历年积蓄的工资、稿费７．８万多元，捐献给国家。为了学习陈嵘热爱祖国、热爱林业科学教育事业的精神，勤奋治学，努力培养林业科技人才，为表达对这位林学会倡导者、领导者的怀念，中国林学会把陈嵘先生捐献的款项和前名誉理事长沈鹏飞、杨衔晋等相继捐献的近万元，合为陈嵘纪念基金，奖励在学术、科普、建议、学会工作等方面有突出成绩的林业工作者。
    《当前影响我国林业发展的主要矛盾及其对策》、《全国林纸联合论证》、《关于征收水资源费按比例还林的建议》等４个类别共计３０项，获得陈嵘奖。
    在１月８日至１２日举行的会议上，还表彰了从事林业工作５０年以上的９７名科技工作者。
