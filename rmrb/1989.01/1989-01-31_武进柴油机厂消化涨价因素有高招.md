In 1988, despite a significant increase in the prices of raw materials and a relatively stable product price, Jiangsu Province's Wujiang Diesel Engine Factory achieved good economic results. The factory realized a profit and tax of 16.25 million yuan, an increase of 29% over the previous year. One of the key reasons for this success was the improvement in the efficiency of capital utilization, allowing capital to appreciate through rapid turnover.

Last year, like many other manufacturing plants across the country, Wujiang Diesel Engine Factory faced the threat of rising raw material prices and increased production costs. However, instead of taking the "easy way out" by raising prices, the factory focused on internal potential, rationally allocating and utilizing various production factors, and accelerating capital turnover to offset the negative impacts of price increases.

The factory reasonably determined the inventory levels of various raw materials, reducing the time from raw material input to product delivery by one week, thereby accelerating capital turnover by 9.19 days. Currently, the factory's turnover speed of floating capital is the fastest in the industry nationwide.

To recover the profits lost due to raw material price increases, the factory also paid close attention to the timely collection of sales revenues. They selected over 160 reliable customers from across the country and prioritized sales to these units. For the few customers who delayed payments, the factory promptly organized efforts to collect the overdue amounts, ensuring that these recovered funds could quickly be reinvested into the production process, maximizing their utility.

　　武进柴油机厂消化涨价因素有高招
    本报讯  １９８８年江苏省武进柴油机厂在原材料大幅度涨价，而产品价格基本不动的情况下，仍取得较好的经济效益。全年实现利税１６２５万元，比上年增长２９％。其中一个重要原因是提高资金使用效益，让资金在快速周转中增值。
    去年，武进柴油机厂和全国许多生产厂家一样，都面临着原材料涨价，生产成本增高的威胁。但是他们没有走“水涨船高”的“捷径”，而是眼睛向内挖掘潜力，合理配置和使用各种生产要素，特别是用加快资金周转来抵消涨价对生产的消极影响。
    这个厂合理确定各种原材料的储备量，使产品从原材料投入到生产出厂，比原来缩短了一个星期的时间，资金周转加快了９．１９天。目前，该厂定额流动资金周转速度居全国同行业首位。
    为了把因原材料涨价而损失的利润找回来，这个厂还十分注意销售货款的及时回笼。他们从全国各地的用户中筛选出１６０多家恪守信用的单位，产品优先销售给这些用户。对于少数用户拖欠的资金，厂里及时组织力量催收，基本上做到月月清，从而使这些回笼资金又能迅速投入到生产过程中去，发挥效用。
