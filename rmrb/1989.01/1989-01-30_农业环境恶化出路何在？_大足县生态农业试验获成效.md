The agricultural environment in Dazhou County, Sichuan Province, has shown significant improvement in recent years through ecological agriculture experiments, leading to a positive cycle in the county's agriculture.

Ecological agriculture is a new type of agricultural production model guided by ecological theory. The South-North Mountain Ecological Agriculture Experimental Zone in Dazhou County began operations in 1984. The total area is 49,000 mu, with a forest coverage rate of only 1.3%, soil erosion covering 63.8%, and relatively severe environmental pollution. Grain production levels were low and unstable.

To ensure the smooth progress of the experimental work, the county first carefully formulated plans and then used various forms to extensively publicize the importance of building ecological agriculture.

In the specific implementation, they adopted a three-pronged approach of paddy fields, dry land, and courtyards.

Five years of practice in the South-North Mountain Ecological Agriculture Experimental Zone have yielded good results:

Improved ecological environment. Over the past five years, 3,000 mu of land has been converted from farmland to forest and grassland, 6 million trees have been planted, 4,390 mu of afforestation has been completed, 983 mu of grassland has been planted, and the forest coverage rate has increased from the original 1.3% to 8.9%. Soil erosion within the experimental zone has been basically controlled, and more than 400 dry wells have begun to flow with clear water again.

Rational industrial structure. With the development of forestry, fruit, livestock, construction, service, commerce, and catering industries, the proportion of agricultural labor has decreased from 83% of the total labor force to 61%, while the proportion of labor engaged in other industries has increased to 39%.

Agriculture begins to show a positive cycle. On slopes and wasteland, the combination of "trees, shrubs, and grass" is used, grass is grown under fruit trees, livestock are raised with grass, and fields are fertilized with manure, reducing soil erosion. The implementation of "rice, mulberry, fish," "rice, fruit, fish," and "rice, forest, fish" cultivation systems not only enriches the soil but also reduces weed and pest damage.

Economic benefits are significant. Over the past five years, the ecological engineering project has invested 280,000 yuan, while the total economic income of the agricultural experimental zone has increased from 602,000 yuan to 1,255,000 yuan. The area of grain fields has decreased by 13%, but the total grain production has increased by 22.1%, fruit production has increased nearly 20 times, meat production has increased by 1.2 times, and courtyard economics have also seen significant development.

　　农业环境恶化出路何在？    
    大足县生态农业试验获成效
    本报讯  四川省大足县近几年认真进行生态农业试验，取得了明显效果，使该县农业开始出现良性循环。
    生态农业是以生态学理论为指导建立起来的一种新型农业生产模式。大足县南北山生态农业试验区工作开始于１９８４年，这里总面积４．９万多亩，森林植被覆盖率仅１．３％，水土流失面积高达６３．８％，环境污染也比较严重，粮食生产水平低而不稳。
    为了使试验工作能够顺利进行，县里首先认真制订规划，然后运用多种形式，深入宣传建设生态农业的重要意义。
    在具体实施中，他们采取稻田、旱地、庭院三路并进的办法。
    ５年实践，南北山生态农业试验区取得了良好效果：
    生态环境改善。５年退耕还林种草３０００多亩，植树６００多万株，成片造林４３９０亩，种草９８３亩，林木覆盖率由原来的１．３％上升到８．９％，试验区内水土流失基本得到控制，４００多口干枯水井重新涌出清水。
    产业结构日趋合理。随着林、果、牧、建、服、商、饮食等业的发展，务农劳力由占总劳力的８３％下降到６１％，从事其他各业的劳力上升到３９％。
    农业开始出现良性循环。山坡、荒地采取“乔、灌、草”结合，果树下种草，以草养畜，以畜肥田，减少了水土流失。推行“稻、桑、鱼”、“稻、果、鱼”、“稻、林、鱼”耕作制度，既培肥了地力，又减少了草害虫害。
    经济效益明显。５年搞生态工程共投入２８万元，而同期农业试验区经济总收入却从６０２万元上升到１２５５万元。粮田面积减少了１３％，粮食总产量却增长了２２．１％，水果增长近２０倍，肉类增长１．２倍。庭院经济也有较大发展。
