Putian City in Fujian Province attaches great importance to the placement of military transfer cadres, ensuring that they can fully utilize their talents and become a crucial force in local economic development.

Since the military's streamlining and reorganization in 1984, Putian City has received and placed 1,297 military transfer cadres. Over the years, 16 of these cadres have been appointed as county-level Party committee members, accounting for 53.3% of the total number of county-level committee members. Seven have been appointed as county-level Party committee secretaries or deputy secretaries; all three major leaders in Xianyou County are military transfer cadres. A total of 307 company-level and below cadres have been appointed to leadership positions in municipal and county (district) government departments, with 13 of them holding deputy county-level or higher leadership positions. Two-thirds of the transfer cadres placed in enterprises and public institutions have been promoted.

Putian City, originally a prefecture-level city, has a small area and few factories and mines. The placement of military transfer cadres is challenging, but the municipal Party committee and government believe that transfer cadres are an important source of local cadres. Proper placement work is crucial for mobilizing the enthusiasm of transfer cadres to participate in local economic construction and ensuring the stability of active-duty personnel. Therefore, transfer cadres should be warmly welcomed, properly placed, diligently cultivated, and rationally used to ensure that everyone can fully utilize their talents.

Putian City treats the placement work as a major task to support national defense construction and strengthen local construction. Relevant departments handle matters according to policies, providing necessary support where appropriate and not making concessions where unnecessary. Cadres at the regiment level and above are placed according to their original military positions, while company-level and below cadres are placed according to their respective specialties and characteristics as much as possible. To help military cadres quickly adapt to local economic work, relevant departments pay special attention to the business training of transfer cadres. In terms of use, as long as they have the courage and ability, they are promoted just like local cadres. For example, Wang Shengzhang, the Party secretary of Xianyou County, served as the logistics director of the military. In 1985, he was transferred and placed in the municipal government office. Later, he was appointed as the deputy secretary of the municipal government. Due to his good work style and outstanding achievements, he was promoted to the county Party secretary in 1988. Zhang Zuyi, the current district mayor of Xianyou, served as the deputy section chief of the military political department. After his transfer, he was assigned to work in the municipal construction commission. Soon, he was promoted to the section chief of the municipal organization department. Because of his excellent work, he was later promoted to deputy mayor and district mayor. Since 1984, three section chiefs of the municipal organization department have been promoted from company-level transfer cadres. The directors and deputy directors of the municipal labor bureau and two leaders of the municipal personnel bureau are also military transfer cadres.

    莆田市重视军队转业干部安置工作
    本报讯  福建省莆田市委、市政府重视军队转业干部的安置工作，使军队转业干部人尽其才，才尽其用，成为地方经济建设的一支重要力量。
    １９８４年部队精简整编以来，莆田市共接收安置军队转业干部１２９７名。几年来，有１６名转业干部担任县区党委常委，占县区常委总数的５３．３％；有７人担任县区委书记、副书记，涵江区三名主要领导都是军队转业干部；有３０７名营以下干部担任了市、县（区）机关科局以上领导，其中有１３名任副县级以上领导职务；安置在企事业单位的转业干部有２／３得到提拔使用。
    莆田市是由原地区改成市建制的，地盘小，厂矿企业少，每年军队转业干部多，安置工作困难很大。但市委、市府认为，转业干部是地方干部的重要来源之一，做好安置工作，关系到调动转业干部参加地方经济建设的积极性，关系到现役干部的安心服役，因此，对军队转业干部应该热情欢迎，妥善安置，热心培养，合理使用，做到人尽其才，才尽其用。莆田市把安置工作作为支援国防建设和加强地方建设的一件大事去抓。有关部门按政策办事，该照顾的照顾，不该照顾的也不迁就。团职以上干部按原来在部队的职务相应安排使用，营以下干部根据各自专长、特点，尽量对口安置。为了使军队干部尽快适应地方经济工作的需要，有关部门还十分注意抓好转业干部的业务培训。在使用上，只要有胆识，有才能，与地方干部一样得到提升。比如，仙游县委书记王声章，在部队任军后勤处长，１９８５年转业安置在市政府办公室工作，后被任命为市政府副秘书长，由于作风好，工作成绩突出，１９８８年被提升为县委书记。现任涵江区区长张祖贻，在部队时是师政治部的副科长，转业时分配在市建委工作。不久，被提为市组织部干部科科长，因为工作出色，后被提为副县长、区长。１９８４年以来，市委组织部干部科三任科长，两任是从营职转业干部提升的。市劳动局正副局长、市人事局两名领导也都是军队转业干部。
