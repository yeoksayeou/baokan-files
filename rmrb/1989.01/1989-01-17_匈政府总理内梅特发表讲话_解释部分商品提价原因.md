Hungarian Prime Minister Nemeth today spoke at a meeting of active members of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party in Budapest, explaining the government's decision to raise prices on certain goods a few days ago.

Since the price increases on certain goods on January 9, some Hungarian trade unions have expressed opposition, and some have even demanded that the government immediately raise wages. The Hungarian Trade Union National Council also expressed disagreement on January 13, demanding that the government convene a special meeting of the National Interests Coordination Committee for discussion.

According to today's report by the Hungarian News Agency, Prime Minister Nemeth stated that the government will not withdraw the price increase decision. On one hand, there is no room for retreat; on the other hand, if the plan to reduce price subsidies is not implemented, Hungary will not be able to lay the foundation for economic stability and revival.

The prime minister also stated that the government cannot accept the trade unions' demand for a general wage increase. He said that if this demand is accepted, wages will be raised across the board without linking wage increases to production results, which will lead to new inflation.

He criticized Hungary's past practice of emphasizing the improvement of living standards and full employment, which led to long-term overconsumption and the need to borrow foreign debt. He said that it is precisely because of this practice that the economy is now in a state of crisis. The government can no longer adopt such simple, seemingly popular, but irresponsible measures.

Nemeth emphasized that the government must ensure that economic reform and political reform proceed simultaneously, but he pointed out that there is currently a tendency to separate these two reforms. Some spontaneous organizations are eager to accelerate political system reform, while the actions and demands of the trade unions after the price increases will hinder the continued progress of economic reform. He agreed to hold a meeting of the National Interests Coordination Committee to ensure that the price increase for consumer goods this year does not exceed 14%.

　　匈政府总理内梅特发表讲话
　　解释部分商品提价原因
    新华社布达佩斯１月１４日电  匈牙利政府总理内梅特今天在匈党布达佩斯市委积极分子会议上发表讲话，解释了政府几天前作出的部分商品提价决定的原因。
    自本月９日部分商品涨价以来，匈牙利一些工会组织表示抗议，有的还要求政府立即提高工资。匈牙利工会全国理事会１３日也表示异议，要求政府召开全国利益协调委员会特别会议予以讨论。
    据匈通社今天报道，内梅特总理表示，政府不会收回提价的决定。这一方面是因为已经没有后退的余地，另一方面是因为不执行减少价格补贴的计划，匈牙利就不可能为经济稳定和振兴打下基础。
    这位政府总理表示不能接受工会普遍增加工资的要求。他说，如果接受这个要求，全面平均提高工资，而不把工资的提高与生产成果挂起钩来，那就会激起新的通货膨胀。
    他批评了匈牙利过去长期片面强调提高生活水平、全部就业、从而形成了长期的超前消费和不得不借外债的做法。他说，正是由于这种做法，才导致今天经济处于危机状态。政府再不能采取这种简单的貌似得人心、但却是不负责任的做法了。
    内梅特强调政府要使经济改革和政治改革同步进行，但他指出，现在有使这两种改革分割的倾向。有些自发性组织热衷于加速政治体制改革，而工会在涨价后所采取的行动和要求则会阻碍经济改革继续前进。他同意举行全国利益协调委员会会议，保证今年的消费品价格上涨幅度不超过１４％。
