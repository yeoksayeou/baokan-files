	Admission "Tricks"
	Jiā Guāngwěi

	Miss Jennifer is an outstanding high school student who is undergoing a university admission interview. As the interview concluded, Jennifer tentatively asked, "Is there anything else I need to do?" The interviewer flipped through her transcript, filled with "A"s, and a set of reliable recommendation letters, appearing thoughtful. "The color of your bedroom walls doesn't seem to be the school's representative color, blue-green."

	Soon, a photograph arrived at the interviewer's desk. In the photo, Jennifer, smiling, held a brush and was painting her walls blue-green. Now, Jennifer has successfully entered the university campus.

	This is a well-known episode from Duke University's admissions process. Similar scenarios occur in other universities as well: Penn State received homemade Australian boomerangs from applicants; Stanford received oil paintings featuring the school's admissions committee members; there were small inventions with patents transferred to the school; and there were life rings printed with "May it save me from the sea of applications." All these actions seem like bribery, but in reality, they are strategies adopted by students to gain admission to their ideal universities. They jokingly refer to these actions as "tricks."

	In the United States, since the 1980s, people have increasingly felt that attending a regular university is not cost-effective, and that attending a prestigious university is more worthwhile. Despite the high tuition fees at prestigious universities, many students still hope to secure a place in a few elite institutions. Therefore, the competition for admission has become more intense. Some parents even hire private tutors for their children to ensure high scores. More students, however, hope to create opportunities through their own efforts. They strive to fully demonstrate their abilities during interviews, engaging cleverly and flexibly with the interviewers, thereby gaining the school's attention. Some even send unique, personalized "physical answers" to the schools. This aligns perfectly with the schools' admission principles. Interviewers are also interested in such students, believing that "physical answers" can showcase the students' creativity and imagination, making them more promising than those who merely chase high scores. Therefore, these students are often given priority. For example, a student from New York State sent a portfolio of his resume to a school and quickly received a satisfactory response. In this battle of wits, the most popular are video programs. Students record their performances and send them to the schools, including tap dancing, karate, musical instrument performances, and comedy skits. This undoubtedly provides the schools with a comprehensive basis for evaluating the students. According to statistics from Bowdoin College in Maine, the school received 100 such video tapes in 1987, compared to only two tapes five years earlier.

	Nowadays, admission "tricks" are prevalent in many universities in the United States. However, there is a concern: will university admissions eventually turn into a "material transaction"?

　　入学“诡计”
    贾光伟
    詹尼弗小姐是一位成绩优秀的高中生，她正在接受大学入学考试的面试。面试结束时，詹尼弗试探地问：“我还需做些什么？”考官翻阅着满是“Ａ”的成绩册和可靠的推荐书，一副若有所思的样子：“你卧室内壁颜色似乎不是青蓝色。”不久，一张照片寄到了考官手中，照片上，微笑的詹尼弗手拿刷子，正在把墙壁刷成青蓝色——该校的代表色。现在，詹尼弗已如愿以偿地跨入了大学校园。
    这是美国享有盛名的杜克大学招生中的一段插曲。类似情景其它大学也有：宾夕法尼亚大学收到考生自制的澳大利亚飞镖；斯坦福大学收到画有学校招生委员会成员的油画；有专利权被转到校方名下的小发明；有印着“愿它救我逃出申请之苦海”的救生圈。这一切看起来像是“贿赂”，其实，这是考生为进入某所理想大学所采取的策略，他们戏称为“诡计”。
    在美国，进入八十年代以来，人们愈加感到上一般大学得不偿失，不如上名牌大学合算。尽管名牌大学费用昂贵，可许多学生还是把出路寄托在上少数名牌大学。因此，入学竞争比以往更为激烈。一些家长们还不惜重金聘请家庭教师为孩子辅导，以图获取高分。而更多的学生则希望通过自己的努力创造机会。他们力求在面试中充分显示自己的才能，机智灵活地与考官周旋，进而得到学校的重视。有的还寄给学校有个性、能体现其聪明才智的“实物答卷”。这恰恰符合学校的招生原则。考官对这类考生也颇感兴趣，认为“实物答卷”能体现考生的创造力和想象力，比那些单纯追求高分的考生更有发展前途。所以，对他们往往优先照顾。如纽约州一考生将自己的简历绘成一本画册寄给学校，很快就得到了满意的答复。在这类智慧的较量中，最受欢迎的还是录相节目。考生将自己的表演，制成录相带寄给学校，其内容包括踢踏舞、空手道、乐器演奏、喜剧小品等等。这无疑为学校全面考察考生提供了依据。据缅因州鲍登学院统计，该校一九八七年共收到这类录相带一百盘，而五年前仅为两盘。
    如今，入学“诡计”已在美国许多大学盛行。然而，令人担忧的是，如此发展下去，大学招生是否会变成“物质交易”？
