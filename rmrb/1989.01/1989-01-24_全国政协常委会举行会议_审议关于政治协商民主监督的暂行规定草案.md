The Standing Committee of the 7th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference held its fourth meeting this morning in the third-floor hall of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

The meeting was convened to review and approve the draft provisions for political consultation and democratic supervision by the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. The draft proposes that major state decisions should generally be subject to political consultation through the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference before being made.

The draft also proposes that political consultation can be conducted at the initiative of the party and government leadership, or the Standing Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference can suggest that the party and government leadership submit issues for political consultation. The democratic rights of members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference should be protected, and all views can be expressed at meetings of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

Vice Chairman Wang Renhe of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference presided over today's meeting. Vice Premier Yao Yilin delivered a report on the current economic situation and the 1989 plan arrangements.

Secretary-General Zhou Shaozhen of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference explained the draft provisions for political consultation and democratic supervision by the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. It was introduced that the draft provisions, which have 15 articles, specifically regulate the purpose, main content, main forms, and basic procedures of political consultation and democratic supervision.

Zhou Shaozhen said that the purpose of drafting these provisional regulations is to provide a basis for future political consultation and democratic supervision work. He mentioned that currently, various levels of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference have encountered some problems in their work, with a common issue being the imperfection of the system for political consultation and democratic supervision, leading to a certain degree of arbitrariness in the work.

Zhou Shaozhen said that from various perspectives, it is necessary and timely to formulate these regulations. Their implementation will take a solid step towards regularizing and institutionalizing political consultation and democratic supervision in China's political life, which will have a beneficial impact on the overall development of socialist democratic politics.

Vice Chairmen Yan Mingfu, Fang Yi, Gu Mu, Yang Jingren, Kang Keqing, Hu Ziyang, Zhou Peiyuan, Qu Wu, Liu Jingji, Wang Enmao, Qian Xuesen, Qian Weichang, Sun Xiaocun, Cheng Siyuan, Qian Zhengying, Su Buqing, and Sima Yi Aimaidi of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference attended the meeting.

　　全国政协常委会举行会议    
    审议关于政治协商民主监督的暂行规定草案
    新华社北京１月２３日电  政协七届全国委员会常务委员会第四次会议今天上午在全国政协礼堂三楼大厅开始举行。
    提请常委会审议并通过的全国政协关于政治协商、民主监督的暂行规定草案提出，国家重大决策在作出之前一般要通过政协进行政治协商。
    这个规定草案还提出，政治协商可以根据党政领导机关的提议进行，也可由政协主席会议建议党政领导机关把问题提交政治协商。政协委员的民主权利应当受到保护，在政协的会议上各种意见都可发表。
    全国政协副主席王任重主持了今天的会议。国务院副总理姚依林在会上作了关于当前经济情况和１９８９年计划安排的报告。
    全国政协秘书长周绍铮就全国政协关于政治协商、民主监督的暂行规定草案作了说明。据介绍，提请常委们审议并通过的政协关于政治协商、民主监督的暂行规定草案共有１５条，对政治协商、民主监督的目的、主要内容、主要形式和基本程序等作了具体规定。
    周绍铮说，起草这个暂行规定，为的是使今后的政治协商、民主监督工作有所遵循。他说，目前，各级政协在开展工作中遇到了一些问题，其中比较集中的反映是政治协商、民主监督的制度不完善，工作中存在一定程度的随意性问题。
    周绍铮说，从各方面情况看，制订这个规定是必要的、及时的，它的实施，将使我国政治生活中的政治协商、民主监督向经常化、制度化迈出扎实的一步，对整个社会主义民主政治建设也将产生有益的影响。
    全国政协副主席阎明复、方毅、谷牧、杨静仁、康克清、胡子昂、周培源、屈武、刘靖基、王恩茂、钱学森、钱伟长、孙晓村、程思远、钱正英、苏步青、司马义·艾买提，出席了会议。
