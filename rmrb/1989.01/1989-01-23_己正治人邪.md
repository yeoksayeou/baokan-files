The saying that "ragpickers collect everything, and thieves steal everything" or that "ragpickers and thieves are brothers" no longer holds true at the Benxi City Material Recycling Company.

In Benxi City, the "King of Rags" has established a used goods police station with the support of relevant departments. This is indeed a novel approach.

Originally, recycling waste is a way to turn trash into treasure. However, determining what is waste and what is not is not an easy task for recycling companies. Currently, there is a trend of theft in society, with some people stealing small items and others stealing large ones, even openly robbing and stealing items that are not waste. Recently, at the construction site of the Beijing Asian Games, some lawless elements stole various types of steel, copper, and aluminum materials, forming a criminal "surrounding circle." The reasons for this are many, but one important factor is that there are too many recycling channels, poor oversight, and chaotic pricing, providing opportunities for lawless elements. In this sense, while ragpickers and thieves are not "brothers," objectively, they do provide a convenient way for thieves to sell stolen goods.

It is precisely from this perspective that the "King of Rags" in Benxi has brought their operations under the rule of law. They have established a used goods police station, improved the registration system for used goods purchases and suspicious item reporting, and provided policy and business training for purchasing personnel. From March 1985 to the present, the police station has received 274 reports from various purchasing stations, preventing economic losses of over 100,000 yuan for the state. This measure has curbed those with dirty hands, making it difficult for them to sell stolen goods even if they steal.

"When the will is upright, evil does not arise" (from "Three Kingdoms: Wei Book: Biography of Xu Hu and Two Wangs"). The "King of Rags" in Benxi has managed others with self-righteousness. If all "Kings of Rags" across the country learn from their experience, those thieves who are eating away at the state and enterprises will still be able to run amok! Of course, this does not mean that enterprises, institutions, and construction units have no work to do. Strictly enforcing regulations and strengthening management to prevent state and enterprise property losses is something that must be done.

　　己正治人邪

    “收破烂儿的什么都收，小偷儿就什么都偷”，“收破烂儿和小偷是亲哥们儿”。这说法在本溪市物资回收总公司已经站不住脚。
    本溪市的“破烂王”在有关部门的支持下，建起了旧货业治安派出所。这的确是件新鲜事。
    本来，回收破烂是个变废为宝的行当。然而，何以为废，何以为旧，回收公司要掌握好这个尺度并非易事。现在，社会上有股偷盗歪风，有人小偷小摸，有人大偷大摸，甚至明偷暗抢，把本不是废旧的物资也弄到回收部门换大钱。前些时候，在北京亚运会工地上，一些不法分子偷取各类钢材、铜、铝等物资，形成一个罪恶的“包围圈”。个中原因虽然很多，但其中重要一条是回收渠道多，不把关，价格乱，给不法分子以可乘之机。从这一点来说，收破烂儿与小偷虽然不是“亲哥们儿”，但客观上确实为小偷销赃提供了方便。
    正是从这一点考虑，本溪的“破烂王”把自己的行为纳入法治的轨道。他们建立了旧货业派出所，健全旧货收购登记和可疑物资举报制度，对收购人员进行政策和业务培训，从１９８５年３月到现在，派出所接到各收购站报案２７４起，使国家免受经济损失１０万多元。这一措施卡住了那些手脚不干净的人，叫他们即使偷了也没处销赃。
    “志正则众邪不生”（《三国志·魏书·徐胡二王传》）。本溪“破烂王”己正治人邪。倘是各地的“破烂王”都认真学习他们的经验，那些蚕食国家、企业的偷儿们，还能胡作非为么！当然，这里并不是说企业、机关以及施工部门就没事了。严格制度，加强管理，防止国家和企业的财产受损失，该做的事情很多。
