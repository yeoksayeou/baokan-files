	Is There Really Such a Thing as 100 Diopters?
	The power of eyeglasses is commonly referred to in terms of diopters, but this terminology actually magnifies the true power by 100 times.

	The power of eyeglasses is measured in diopters (D). One diopter is equivalent to a focal length of one meter. The total refractive power of a normal eye is only 67.3 diopters. Eyeglasses are used to adjust the refractive power of the eye, and even if the entire refractive power of the eye were lost (which is actually impossible), one would not need to wear 100 diopter glasses. From this, it is clear that what is commonly referred to as "hundred diopter glasses" should correctly be called "one diopter glasses."

	How did such a large error come about? This can be traced back to the way prescriptions are written. The power of eyeglasses is calculated to two decimal places. For example, 150 diopters should correctly be written as 1.50 D, but people often overlook the decimal point when reading the prescription, turning it into 150 diopters; 10.00 D becomes 1000 diopters. In this way, the error is passed down, and over time, it becomes a traditional way of speaking.

　　真有百度近视吗？
    眼镜度数通常口头上都叫多少百度，其实这种叫法是将真正度数扩大了１００倍。
    眼镜的度数是以透镜的屈光度（Ｄ）为单位的。１屈光度实际就是１米焦点距离。而正常眼球全部屈光力才只有６７．３度。眼镜是调节眼屈光力强弱的，即使全部眼屈光力丧失（实际不可能），也不需戴上１００度眼镜。由此可见，所谓几百度眼镜正确叫法应是几度眼镜。
    为何会产生这样大的错误呢？这要从配镜处方的写法上谈起。眼镜度数是计算到小数后两位。例如：１５０度的正规写法应是１．５０Ｄ，而人们看处方时往往忽略了单位后面的小数点，于是变成了１５０度；１０．００Ｄ则变成了１０００度。这样以讹传讹，时间长了便成为传统叫法。
