Over the past few years, as China's legal system has strengthened, various departmental laws have become more comprehensive. However, currently, there are issues with the promotion and implementation of some regulations, particularly departmental laws. After some laws are promulgated, aside from the relevant business departments that are somewhat familiar with them, many people in the general public are not very clear about them.

Some departmental laws lack clear enforcement agencies, and their intended effects have not been realized. For example, the Compulsory Education Law was drafted by the Ministry of Education and approved by the National People's Congress. However, it is unclear from the law which department is responsible for supervising and enforcing it, and who should investigate and prosecute violations. Therefore, since the law was enacted over two years ago, its effectiveness has not been ideal, and many of its provisions have not been implemented.

There is often a lack of clarity regarding the responsibilities of enforcement agencies and business departments, leading to a lot of buck-passing. Laws such as the Land Management Law, Mineral Resources Law, Forest Law, Food Hygiene Law, Drug Administration Law, Technology Contract Law, and Environmental Protection Law all have insufficiently specific regulations in this regard. Consequently, illegal activities such as unauthorized land occupation, indiscriminate logging, and unauthorized mining cannot be promptly punished by law.

We believe that when the state formulates departmental laws, it should clearly specify the main supervisory and enforcement departments in the specific clauses or legal explanations, and clearly define the responsibilities of the enforcement agencies and business departments. For departmental laws that have already been promulgated but lack clarity in this regard, supplementary regulations should be made.

　　法律如何落到实处？
    近几年来，随着我国法制建设的加强，部门法日趋健全。但是，目前有些法规，特别是部门法颁布以后，宣传、贯彻等方面都存在一些问题。有些法律颁布以来，除了有关业务部门比较熟悉外，群众中有很多人不大清楚。
    有些部门法的执法单位不明确，作用未发挥。如义务教育法是教育部门制订，全国人大通过的。但这一法律到底由谁家负责监督执行，违法时由谁去追究查处，从法律条文中看不明白，实际责任也不明确。因而，这一法律颁布施行两年多来，效果并不理想，有许多条款都没有落实。
    执法机关与业务部门的职责不清，互相扯皮多。土地管理法、矿产资源法、森林法、食品卫生法、药品管理法、技术合同法、环境保护法等，在这方面规定的都不够具体，因而乱占耕地、滥伐森林、乱开滥采矿产等违法现象，不能及时受到法律制裁。
    我们认为，国家在制定部门法时，应在具体条款或法律说明中，明确规定主要监督执行部门，明确规定执法机关与业务部门各自的职责。对已颁布的部门法规，在这方面不明确的，应作补充规定。
