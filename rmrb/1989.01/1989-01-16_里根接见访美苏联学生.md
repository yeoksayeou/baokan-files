President Reagan today met with visiting Soviet students at the White House. He said he hopes that the world will not see another war in the future.

　　里根接见访美苏联学生
    新华社华盛顿１月１３日电  里根总统今天在白宫接见来访的苏联学生。他说，他希望世界今后不会发生另一场战争。
    来自莫斯科的大约４０名苏联学生于本周早些时候抵达美国进行访问，这次访问是根据里根和苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫在去年夏天的莫斯科首脑会谈中倡议的美苏文化交流计划而安排的。
