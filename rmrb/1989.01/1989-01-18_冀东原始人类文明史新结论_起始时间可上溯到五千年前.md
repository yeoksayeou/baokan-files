Recently, archaeology experts have examined stone tools and pottery unearthed from Xizhai Village in Xianxi County, Hebei Province, and concluded that the prehistoric civilization of Eastern Hebei can be traced back to 5,000 years ago.

A large number of artifacts, including stone tools and pottery used for production and daily life, were excavated from the ancient cultural site in Xizhai Village. The stone tools were made using three methods: striking, chipping, and grinding. Fine stone tools and net sinkers were prevalent, including axes, adzes, grinding slabs, and grinding rods. The pottery was handmade, featuring shapes such as jars, basins, bowls, and cups. The surfaces of these vessels were decorated with various patterns, including horizontal "zhi" characters, fingernail marks, and scratched lines.

Experts have identified the site as belonging to the "Hongshan Culture" of the Neolithic Age, with distinct local characteristics and dating back approximately 5,000 years. This discovery pushes back the timeline of Eastern Hebei's prehistoric civilization by over 1,000 years compared to previous conclusions. It also provides valuable material evidence for further research and discussion on the formation and characteristics of the primitive culture in the Luan River basin.

　　冀东原始人类文明史新结论
    起始时间可上溯到五千年前
    新华社石家庄１月１７日电  最近，考古专家对河北省迁西县西寨村出土的石器、陶器考证后认为，冀东地区原始人类文明史可上溯到５０００年以前。
    这次西寨村古文化遗址发掘出的大量文物有石器、陶器等生产工具和生活用品。石器采用打、琢、磨三种方法制成，其中细石器、网坠居多，有斧、锛、磨盘、磨棒等；陶器为手制，有罐、盆、碗、盅等器形。器形表面饰以横“之”字纹、指甲纹、划纹等多种纹饰。
    据专家鉴定，遗址为新石器时代“红山文化”类型，有明显的地方特色，年代距今约５０００年。这一发现，使冀东原始人类文明史可以上溯到５０００年以前，比过去的结论提前一千年以上。它还为进一步研究探讨滦河流域的原始文化的形成及特点提供了珍贵的实物资料。
