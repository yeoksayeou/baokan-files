	Rambling About the Diamond City
	Wang Shujuan

	I first saw a variety of diamond jewelry in Antwerp, a city in northern Belgium. Antwerp's diamond cutting and polishing are renowned worldwide, and the craftsmanship is considered the best in the world. I have visited a processing factory and seen that each step of the operation has extremely strict requirements. The gemstones entering the factory are first inspected for flaws, then sent to the cutting workshop. Next, workers in the rough grinding workshop shape it into the desired form. The final step is called polishing, where experienced craftsmen can polish fifty-eight facets on a one-carat diamond, truly a marvel of skill!

	After processing, diamonds must be certified before they can enter the trading market. The certification issued by the Antwerp Diamond High Council is one of the most authoritative in the world. The certification includes fluorescence, color, purity, and polishing quality, each with several grades.

	Antwerp is a historic city for diamond processing. As early as 1483, a diamond worker named Walter Boever established the first family workshop in the area. By the 16th century, the flourishing of handicrafts brought prosperity to the diamond industry, and a large number of skilled workers in diamond and gold jewelry processing emerged. Today, there are 15,000 people registered in this industry, and out of the 20 diamond exchanges in the world, four are in Antwerp. Within a 20-square-kilometer area near the central train station, it is like a diamond world, with a diamond museum, a diamond club, and countless jewelry stores.

	Today, Antwerp is not only the world's center for jewelry diamonds but also the processing and trading center for industrial diamonds. In 1987, the total import and export volume exceeded $9 billion, making it the world leader. In the Antwerp Diamond Museum, every Saturday afternoon, diamond workers perform live demonstrations for the audience. In recent years, diamonds have also become a symbol of the best in sports and arts competitions. For example, every autumn, the international tennis tournament held in Antwerp has a unique prize: a diamond-encrusted tennis racket. The three letters ECC, symbolizing the European Tennis Championship, are composed of 1,600 diamonds. Whoever wins the championship three times in five years can receive this precious racket.

　　漫话钻石城
    王淑娟
    我第一次见到花样奇多的钻石首饰，是在比利时北方的安特卫普市。安市的钻石加工遐迩闻名，磨琢水平堪称天下第一。笔者参观过加工厂，看到每道工序的操作要求极其严格。进厂的宝石先接受检验看有否疵点，接着送进锯割车间。然后，粗磨车间的工人把它磨成需要的形状。最后一道工序叫磨琢，经验丰富的匠人竟能在一克拉的钻石上磨出五十八个面，真叫“鬼斧神工”！
    加工后的钻石需经过鉴定方可进入交易市场。安市钻石最高理事会颁发的鉴定证书为世界上最有权威的证书之一。鉴定包括荧光度、颜色、纯度、磨琢质量四项内容，每一项又分成若干等级。
    安市是钻石加工的历史名城。早在一四八三年，一位名叫沃特·博韦尔的钻石工，办起了当地首家家庭作坊。至十六世纪，手工艺品的蓬勃发展带来钻石业的繁荣，涌现出一大批加工钻石与金银首饰的能工巧匠。如今，注册从事这一行的就有一万五千人，全世界共有二十个钻石交易所，四个就在安特卫普。中心火车站附近二十平方公里内，宛如一片钻石世界，那里有钻石博物馆，钻石俱乐部，还有数不清的首饰店。
    今天，安市不仅是世界首饰钻石中心，同时也是工业钻石的加工与交易中心。一九八七年，进出口总额超过九十亿美元，居世界之冠。在安市的钻石博物馆，每逢星期六下午，钻石工为观众作现场表演。近年来，钻石也作为最美好的象征进入了体育、文艺比赛等活动。譬如，每年秋天在安市举行的国际网球赛，有一件非同寻常的奖品：一块镶有钻石的网球拍，上面的ＥＣＣ三个象征欧洲网球赛的英文字母是用一千六百块钻石组成的。谁在五年内三次荣获冠军，谁就可得到这块珍贵的球拍。
