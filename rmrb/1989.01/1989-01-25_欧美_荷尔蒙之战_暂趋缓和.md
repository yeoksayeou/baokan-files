On January 23, the European Community's Council of Ministers, after consultations, decided to postpone retaliatory measures against the United States in the current "hormone war," seeking to resolve the bilateral meat trade dispute through negotiations. Thus, the tense situation that had arisen between the U.S. and Europe in the trade of hormone-laced meat over the past month has temporarily eased.

The decision of the European Community's Council of Ministers reflects its intention to seek compromise and avoid a full-scale trade war. The chairman of the European Community's Council of Ministers, Spanish Foreign Minister Fernandez Ordonez, said on January 18 that dialogue with the United States is "crucial," and that stable relations with the United States should be strengthened.

The "hormone war" between the U.S. and Europe has been going on for over a year. At the end of 1987, the European Community, under pressure from consumers, decided to ban the use of hormones to fatten livestock in member countries starting January 1, 1988, and to ban the sale and import of hormone-laced meat from third countries starting this New Year, in order to "protect consumers' health."

The European Community's decision greatly angered the United States. The United States is a major exporter of meat, exporting over 100,000 tons of meat products to the European Community each year. Since the United States widely uses growth hormones in livestock farming, the European Community's decision was seen by the United States as a "veiled trade barrier." On one hand, the United States criticized the European Community's ban as "lacking scientific basis," emphasizing that American farmers only use hormones that are harmless to humans, and demanding that it rescind the order. On the other hand, it threatened retaliatory measures, saying it would impose a 100% tariff on certain European food exports to the United States to compensate for the economic losses suffered by American ranchers (estimated at $130 million to $150 million per year), and even threatened to completely ban European meat exports to the United States, causing the European Community to suffer approximately $400 million in losses each year.

Facing the United States' threats, the European Community retorted that the ban on importing hormone-laced meat was not intended to target the United States, but applied to all countries inside and outside the European Community. The European Community believes that countries like Australia, New Zealand, and Argentina have already accepted the European Community's regulations, and "there is no reason for American meat to be treated differently." However, to avoid conflict with the United States, the European Community is still willing to continue importing offal from hormone-fed livestock and intends to increase imports of hormone-free beef from the United States to reduce American economic losses.

After the European Community's proposal was rejected by the United States, the two sides attempted to find a solution before the European Community's ban took effect last year, but they were unsuccessful.

The recently concluded European Community's Council of Ministers meeting only determined the list of products included in future retaliatory measures, but did not decide on the date to implement the retaliatory plan. This indicates that while the European Community is unwilling to back down, it is more restrained in its specific actions. Because the escalation of a trade war can only result in mutual damage.

For many years, trade wars between the U.S. and Europe have been ongoing. The United States complains that the European Community has taken its market and is even more dissatisfied with the European Community's agricultural subsidy policy.

The current "hormone dispute" involves products worth only $200 million (the total bilateral trade volume between the U.S. and Europe is approximately $150 billion), but it reflects the deep contradictions between Europe and the United States in trade.

### 欧美“荷尔蒙之战”暂趋缓和

　　欧美“荷尔蒙之战”暂趋缓和
    姚立
    １月２３日，欧洲共同体外长会议经过磋商，决定在当前同美国的“荷尔蒙之战”中，推迟对美国执行反报复措施，争取和美国通过谈判解决双方肉类贸易争端。这样，美欧近一个月来在含荷尔蒙的肉类贸易中出现的剑拔弩张的局面，暂时缓解。
    欧共体外长会议的决定反映了它寻求妥协、避免发生全面贸易战的意向。欧共体部长理事会执行主席、西班牙外交大臣费尔南德斯·奥多涅斯本月１８日说，欧共体与美国的对话“至关重要”，应加强与美国的“稳固关系”。
    美欧的“荷尔蒙之战”已持续了一年多。１９８７年年底，欧共体迫于消费者的压力，决定从１９８８年１月１日起禁止成员国使用激素为肉畜催肥，并从今年元旦开始，禁止销售和从第三国进口含荷尔蒙的肉类，以“保护消费者的健康”。
    欧共体的决定使美国大为恼火。美国是肉类出口国，每年向欧共体出口的肉类产品达１０余万吨。而美国在肉畜饲养中普遍使用生长激素，所以，欧共体的决定被美国视为“蒙着面纱的贸易壁垒”。美国一方面批评欧共体的禁令“没有科学依据”，强调美国农民只使用对人体无害的激素，要求它收回成命。另一方面又以报复措施相威胁，说要对欧共体的某些输美食品征收１００％的关税，以挽回美国牧民遭受的经济损失（据称每年１．３亿至１．５亿美元），甚至扬言，它将根据不久前制定的新贸易法，全面禁止欧共体对美国的肉类出口，使欧共体每年将蒙受约４亿多美元的损失。
    面对美国的威胁，欧共体反驳说，禁止进口带有荷尔蒙的肉类并非有意和美国作对，而是对欧共体内外的所有国家都一样。欧共体认为澳大利亚、新西兰和阿根廷等国都已接受了欧共体的规定，“美国的肉类没有理由享受例外”。但是，欧共体为避免和美国发生冲突，还是愿意继续进口用荷尔蒙催肥的肉畜下水等，并有意增加从美国进口不含荷尔蒙的牛肉，以减少美国的经济损失。
    在欧共体的建议被美国拒绝后，去年双方曾试图在欧共体的禁令生效前找到一个解决方案，但没有成功。
    刚刚结束的欧共体外长会议只确定了未来反报复措施包括的产品名单，而没有决定实施反报复计划的日期。这表明欧共体虽然不愿退让，但在具体作法上则较克制。因为，贸易战升级的结果只能落得个两败俱伤。
    多年来，美欧的贸易战一直此起彼伏。美国埋怨欧共体抢了它的市场，对欧共体的农业补贴政策更为不满。
    目前的这场“荷尔蒙之争”涉及到的产品总值虽然只有２亿美元（美欧双边贸易额约１５００亿美元），但却反映了欧美之间在贸易方面的深刻矛盾。
