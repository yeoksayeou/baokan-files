Ouyang Xiu's "Record of the Drunken Terrace" has been widely acclaimed for centuries. It is said that Ouyang originally wrote more than 40 characters to describe the natural scenery around Huzhou. Then, with a sudden change of tone, he wrote "All around Huzhou are mountains." These five short characters are highly concentrated, have a broad scope, and lead into the following text, smoothly and naturally, without any trace of editing. Moreover, the word "also" as a modal particle connects the sentences, like a string of pearls, making the entire article's rhythm rise and fall, fresh and unique.

Some people have questioned the authenticity of this opening sentence. Ming dynasty scholar Lang Ying in "Seven Revisions of Miscellaneous Notes" mentioned that he had been to Huzhou and saw that "Huzhou is vast and boundless, with only Langya Mountain to the west," criticizing Ouyang Xiu for saying "How can it be so?!" Some contemporary scholars also express similar views. Some literary critics even assert: "There is no need to argue; it can be seen as the author's artistic need." All these views generally suggest that Ouyang Xiu wrote carelessly and did not reflect the true situation.

The other day, I went to Huzhou to visit relatives and observed the area firsthand. I also consulted with contemporary "Huzhou people" and realized that Ouyang Xiu had a basis for his words and should not be lightly criticized.

Ouyang Xiu served as the magistrate of Huzhou, overseeing three counties. "All around Huzhou are mountains" is his broad view from the county seat, writing from a macro perspective of the entire region and all directions. The eastern part of the county, Lai'an, is eight-tenths mountainous, with peaks such as Mataou, Longwang, and Lianzi; the county seat, Qingliu (now Huzhou City, including the southern part of Jianshan County), has General, Millstone, and Dài Mountains to the northwest. The northern part of Qingliu and the southern part of Lai'an are all rolling hills. To the south, across the Hu River, the mountains of Jiangpu in Suzhou stand like screens, perfectly complementing the scenery. The surrounding mountains and scenery are real and vivid.

The area around Huzhou City and the confluence of the Hu River and Qingliu River to the southeast is one of the few flat areas in the county. Opposite the southwest, there are countless "small mountains of Huainan," with very low altitudes and not easily noticeable. People's doubts about the authenticity of Ouyang Xiu's description are likely related to this specific situation, easily leading to misconceptions. Understanding this situation, and then reading the following text, one can appreciate the exquisite thought of Master Liuyi. The hills also have forests and valleys, but they are not as beautiful as the high mountains of Langya; the low-altitude and scattered small mountains naturally will not make people "look at them and feel deep and elegant" like Langya Mountain.

### “环滁皆山也”

　　“环滁皆山也”
    朱靖宇
    欧阳修的《醉翁亭记》，千百年来脍炙人口。据说，欧阳原来用了４０多个字，历写滁州四围自然风貌。随之，掉转笔锋一抹到底，改写成了“环滁皆山也”。这短短五字，凝聚度高，涵盖面广，导引出下文，从容，自然，不落裁接痕迹。而且，这个“也”字的语气助词，衔接成句，累如贯珠，使得通篇文势波澜起伏，生面别开。
    有些人对这开头一句的真实性提出非议。明人郎瑛在《七修类稿》里讲，他到过滁州，看到的是“滁州四望无际，止西有琅琊”，责怪欧阳修“何以云然？！”当代有的知名学者，也表示同感。有的文学批评家则断言：不必纠缠，不妨看成是作者的艺术表现的需要。以上这些看法，总的是说欧阳修信笔涂抹，不符实情。
    早些天，我去滁州市探望亲戚，实地观测了一番，并且向当代的“滁人”们讨教，方感到欧阳修言之有据，不容轻訾。
    欧阳修任职滁州知州，治属三县。“环滁皆山也”，是他在州治之内，放眼宏观，从全境、全方位落笔的。州属东境来安县，十分之八是山区，马头、龙王、练子诸峰罗列；州治清流县（今滁州市，包括嘉山县南部），西北有将军、磨盘山和岱山。清流北境和来安南境，统属连绵丘陵。南面滁河对岸宛如列屏的苏属江浦诸峰，正好借来补衬。四围山色，风光是实实在在的。
    滁州城周近和东南面滁河、清流河交汇处，是全州难得的平坦地带。和西南方位相对的，则是数不清的“淮南小山”，海拔极低，不易触目。人们怀疑欧阳修叙写的真实性，当和这具体情况有关，草草一顾，易生错觉。明了这情况，再看下文，足觇六一居士文思之精妙。丘陵也有林壑，但不如琅琊高山之“尤美”；低海拔而又散列的小山，自然也不会像琅琊山那样使人们“望之蔚然而深秀”。
