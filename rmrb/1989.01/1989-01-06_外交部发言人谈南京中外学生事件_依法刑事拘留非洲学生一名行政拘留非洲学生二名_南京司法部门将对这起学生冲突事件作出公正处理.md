Foreign Ministry Spokesperson on the Nanjing Incident Involving Chinese and Foreign Students
One African Student Detained, Two Administratively Detained
Nanjing Judicial Authorities to Handle the Student Conflict Incident Fairly

New China News Agency, Beijing, January 5th – Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Li Zhaoxing stated today that during the conflict between Chinese and African students in Nanjing in late December last year, Nanjing judicial authorities detained one African student and administratively detained two African students.

Li Zhaoxing emphasized at the afternoon press conference that the Chinese government protects the legitimate rights of foreigners in China according to law. At the same time, according to international law and Chinese laws, foreigners in China must abide by Chinese laws. This principle is also recognized by all countries. Relevant Chinese authorities have the right to handle any lawbreaker according to relevant laws and legal procedures. It is natural for individual foreign students who violate Chinese laws to be dealt with according to law. Similarly, if Chinese students violate the law, they will also be dealt with according to law. In China, Chinese students and foreign students are equal before the law. Nanjing judicial authorities will handle this student conflict incident fairly.

A reporter asked: Some people say that the root cause of the recent conflict between Chinese and foreign students in Nanjing is China's policy of racial discrimination. What is your comment on this?

Li Zhaoxing said: This statement is incorrect and is a distortion of China's policy towards Africa. The Nanjing student incident is a campus security incident and has nothing to do with racial discrimination. It is known to all that China implements policies of ethnic equality and ethnic unity domestically; internationally, China advocates that all ethnicities, regardless of skin color or religious beliefs, are equal, and firmly opposes policies of racial segregation and racial discrimination.

He said, China is a member of the Third World and insists on strengthening solidarity and cooperation with Third World countries as a basic starting point for its foreign work. Whether in the past, present, or future, we are mutually understanding and supportive. We cherish the deep traditional friendship that has been established between China and African countries and hope that it will be strengthened.

　　外交部发言人谈南京中外学生事件
    依法刑事拘留非洲学生一名行政拘留非洲学生二名
    南京司法部门将对这起学生冲突事件作出公正处理
    新华社北京１月５日电  外交部发言人李肇星今天说，在去年１２月下旬在南京发生的中国和非洲留学生冲突中，南京司法部门刑事拘留非洲学生一名，行政拘留非洲学生二名。
    李肇星在下午举行的新闻发布会上强调，中国政府依法保护在华外国人的正当权益。同时，根据国际法和中国法律，在中国境内的外国人必须遵守中国法律。这个原则也是世界各国公认的。中国有关当局有权根据有关法律、按照法律程序对任何违法的人进行处理。个别外国学生违反中国法律，受到依法处理是自然的。同样，中国学生如果违反法律，也要依法处理。在中国，中国学生和外国学生在法律面前是平等的。南京司法部门将对这起学生冲突事件做出公正处理。
    记者问：有人说，南京最近发生的中外学生冲突的根本原因是中国的种族歧视政策。你对此有何评论？
    李肇星说：这种说法是不正确的，是对中国对非洲政策的歪曲。南京学生事件是校园治安事件，与种族歧视毫无关系。众所周知，中国在国内实行民族平等、民族团结政策；在国际上主张各民族，不论肤色、宗教信仰，都一律平等，坚决反对种族隔离、种族歧视政策。
    他说，中国是第三世界的一员，坚持把加强与发展同第三世界国家的团结与合作作为我国对外工作的一个基本立足点。无论在过去、现在，还是将来，我们都是相互理解、相互支持的。我们珍视中国与非洲国家间业已建立起来的深厚传统友谊，希望它能得到加强。
