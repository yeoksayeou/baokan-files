The American Petroleum Institute said today that U.S. oil production, which has been declining for three consecutive years, has now dropped to its lowest level in 24 years. This has led to the United States relying more heavily on imported oil from the Middle East for its energy consumption.

Last month, the amount of crude oil imported into the United States exceeded its domestic production for the first time in nine years. The institute said that if this trend continues, it will affect the future energy situation in the United States.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced today that the U.S. trade deficit for last November reached $11 billion, a 25% increase from the previous month. The growth in imports, including crude oil, will pose a more severe challenge for the incoming Bush administration.

　　美国石油产量下降进口增加
    本报华盛顿１月１８日电  记者仓立德报道：美国石油研究所今天说，连续３年下降的美国石油产量目前已降至２４年来最低点，使美国的能源消费不得不更多地依赖中东的进口原油。
    上个月，美国的原油进口量已经超过其原油产量，这是９年来的第一次。石油研究所说，如不扭转这种趋势，必将影响美国将来能源状况。
    与此同时，美国商务部今天宣布，美国去年１１月的贸易逆差达到１１０亿美元，比１０月份猛升２５％。包括原油等商品进口增长，将使即将上台的布什政府面临更严峻的考验。
