The U.S. Department of Commerce announced on January 13 that the retail sales volume in the United States in 1988 reached 1.61 trillion dollars, an increase of 6.7 percent over 1987. This is the largest increase in retail sales volume since 1984.

Although the overall retail sales volume in the United States grew rapidly throughout 1988, the increase in December was only 0.2 percent. Some economists believe that this may indicate that the pace of economic growth in the United States will slow down this year.

　　美去年商品零售额增幅大
    新华社华盛顿电  美国商务部一月十三日宣布，去年美国的商品零售额达一万六千一百亿美元，比一九八七年增长了百分之六点七。这是自一九八四年以来美国的商品零售额增长幅度最大的一年。
    尽管去年全年美国的商品零售额增长较快，但十二月份仅增长百分之零点二。有些经济学家认为，这可能预示着今年美国经济的增长速度将放慢。
