The first volleyball training base in China, established in 1972, has evolved from a simple training facility into a multifunctional training center that includes living, training, research, and teaching functions.

During the national youth volleyball team's winter training, the Zhanjiang base has integrated computers, microcomputers, video analysis equipment, and microcomputers into the training of various teams. Microcomputers have been used to diagnose the jumping training of 150 athletes; video analysis equipment and microcomputers have been used to analyze the biomechanics of spiking techniques for more than 50 main attackers. This scientific approach has helped determine the quantitative models for each athlete's technical indicators, which has been well-received by athletes and coaches, promoting scientific training.

During the winter training, volleyball experts from across the country have conducted scientific research on various projects based on the data provided by different electronic devices and have conducted electronic teaching for athletes.

    排球队员借助科研掌握技术
    本报讯  建于１９７２年的我国第一个排球训练基地——漳州训练基地，已由单纯提供运动队训练场所变成具有生活、训练、科研、教学等多功能的训练中心。
    在全国青年排球队冬训中，漳州基地已把电脑、微机、录像解析仪及微电脑等先进电子设备用于各队训练之中。微机为１５０名运动员的弹跳训练进行了诊断；录像解析仪及微电脑为５０多名主攻手作扣球技术生物力学动作诊断和分析，科学地确定每个队员的技术环节指标的定量模式，受到广大运动员、教练员的欢迎，促进了科学训练。
    冬训中，来自全国各地的排球专家还根据各种电子设备提供的数据进行了许多项目的科学研究并对运动员进行电化教学。（陈继共）
