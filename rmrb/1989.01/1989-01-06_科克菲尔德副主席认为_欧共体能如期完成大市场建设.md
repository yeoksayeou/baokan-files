Vice Chairman Cockfield Believes the EC Can Complete the Single Market on Schedule

Summary: The three areas where progress has been slow are coordinating indirect taxes among member states, establishing European citizenship, and implementing uniform standards for animal and plant quarantine. If by 1992 some member states lag behind, the EC will allow this situation to persist for a period.

BRUSSELS, Jan. 6 (Xinhua) — Lord Cockfield, the Vice Chairman of the European Commission responsible for the single market, emphasized in an interview with our reporter that by 1992, we will be able to complete the construction of the single market on schedule. Of course, "there is still a lot of work to be done, and we cannot relax." He then detailed the three areas where progress has been slow: indirect taxation, European citizenship, and animal and plant quarantine.

Currently, all EC member states levy indirect taxes, including value-added tax and consumption tax. This means that there are still many tariff barriers within the EC market, and separate national markets exist. The EC has made little progress in coordinating tax rates, mainly due to two obstacles: first, the existing tax systems of the member states differ greatly and are difficult to coordinate; second, some member states believe that unified taxation will sacrifice sovereignty.

To eliminate these trade barriers, the Commission has proposed two main measures: 1. Member states gradually abolish the system of tax exemption on exports and taxation on imports, allowing goods within the EC to circulate freely on the basis of paying value-added tax. 2. Implement a uniform consumption tax on tobacco, alcohol, and petroleum products, gradually abolishing consumption taxes with border inspection characteristics.

Regarding "European citizenship," the Commission's proposals mainly include freedom of transit, freedom to establish enterprises, and freedom of residence. Over the past four years, the EC has made some progress in the free movement of people. Unfortunately, the Council has not yet adopted some important proposals from the Commission, such as facilitating the transit of tourists and the directive on the right of residence for citizens.

Thirdly, there are difficulties in animal and plant quarantine. This is a sensitive area with different regulations in each member state. In the long term, the EC should have a common standard for the entire animal and plant quarantine.

Cockfield also emphasized that realizing the single market is the key to opening the door to the future. In a special report he recently drafted, he plans to introduce these difficulties to the heads of state, making them understand where greater efforts should be made.

At this point, he gave a vivid analogy: "Twelve horses pulling a carriage, if two horses are slow, you have to urge them to move faster, and you can't waste time." When asked by the reporter, "What if one of the horses refuses to move? Do you abandon it or accommodate it?" He smiled and said, "For now, we don't want to leave any member state behind."

He added, "By the time the deadline for achieving the single market arrives, there may still be one or two member states lagging behind. At that time, we will have to formulate another policy, allowing the lagging situation to persist for a period."

### 科克菲尔德副主席认为  欧共体能如期完成大市场建设

　　科克菲尔德副主席认为
    欧共体能如期完成大市场建设
    内容提要：进展较慢的三个方面是：协调成员国的间接税、建立公民的欧洲及实行统一的动植物卫生检疫标准。到１９９２年如有个别成员国落伍，欧共体将允许这种情况存在一段时间。
    本报布鲁塞尔电　记者魏崴报道：欧洲共同体委员会专门负责大市场建设的副主席洛德·科克菲尔德先生，在接受本报记者采访时首先强调，１９９２年，我们能如期完成大市场的建设。当然，今后“尚有许多工作要做，我们不能放松”。接着，他详细介绍了目前进展较慢的３个领域：间接税收制的协调、公民的欧洲以及动植物卫生检疫。
    目前，欧共体成员国都征收间接税，即增值税和消费税。这样，欧共体市场内部就还有许多关税壁垒，存在单独的国家市场。欧共体至今在协调税率方面进展不大，主要障碍有两个：一是成员国的现行税收制差别太大，不易协调；二是部分成员国认为，统一税收会牺牲主权。
    为消除这些贸易壁垒，委员会建议主要有两条：１、诸成员国逐步取消出口免税、进口征税的制度，使欧共体内的商品在支付增值税的基础上自由流通。２、对烟草、酒类及石油产品等实行统一消费税，逐步取消带有边界检查性质的消费税。
    至于“公民的欧洲”，委员会建议主要包括过境自由、兴办企业自由和居住自由。４年来，欧共体在人员自由流通上取得一些进展，遗憾的是，委员会有关的重要建议尚未被理事会通过，如便利旅游者过境以及公民居住权等指令。
    第三，动植物卫生检疫的困难。这是个敏感领域，各成员国有不同的规定。从长远看，欧共体应在整个动植物检疫方面有一共同标准。
    科克菲尔德还强调，实现大市场是打开未来大门的钥匙。他在最近起草的特别报告中，准备向各国首脑介绍上述困难，使之明白应当在哪些方面作出更大努力。
    说到此处，他打了个生动的比方：１２匹马共拉一部车子，有两匹马动作迟缓，就得催其快走，不能因此而浪费时间。当记者问道，“如果其中一匹马硬是不走，怎么办呢？是甩掉它，还是迁就？”他笑着说，目前还不想使任何一成员国落伍。
    他又说，等到实现大市场的期限到达之日，也许还会有一个，或者两个成员国落伍。那时，我们得另订政策，允许落伍现象存在一段时间。
