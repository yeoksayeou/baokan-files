The Soviet Union supports the Kabul regime's ceasefire decision

New China News Agency, Moscow, December 31, 1988 - The Soviet Foreign Ministry issued a statement today expressing support for the Kabul regime's decision to unilaterally cease fire across Afghanistan starting January 1, 1989. The Soviet troops remaining in Afghanistan will also cease fire starting tomorrow.

According to reports, the Kabul regime announced the ceasefire on December 30, stating that it would take no military action against the resistance forces. However, it also declared that if the resistance forces do not comply with this decision, the government troops will launch a full-scale offensive against them.

The statement also hopes that the resistance forces, as well as the United States and Pakistan, will respond to the ceasefire initiative. It reiterates the Soviet Union's willingness to stop supplying weapons to the warring parties on an equal basis starting tomorrow, alongside the United States.

Observers here noted that this statement was issued at a time when the Soviet Union has already withdrawn more than half of its troops from Afghanistan and is set to complete the withdrawal by February 15 next year. The Afghan resistance forces have taken a hardline stance, and the Kabul authorities are concerned about their ability to maintain control.

　　苏联支持喀布尔政权停火决定
    新华社莫斯科１９８８年１２月３１日电  苏联外交部今天发表声明，表示支持喀布尔政权从１９８９年１月１日起在阿富汗全境单方面停火的决定，留在阿富汗的苏军也从明天起停火。
    据报道，喀布尔政权是３０日宣布停火、不再向抵抗组织采取任何军事行动决定的。但它又声称，如果抵抗组织不执行这一决定，政府军将向抵抗组织发动全面进攻。
    声明还希望抵抗力量和美国与巴基斯坦响应停火倡议，并重申苏联愿意在对等基础上从明天起与美国一起停止向交战各方提供武器。
    此间人士注意到，这项声明是在苏联已从阿富汗撤走多一半驻军并将在明年２月１５日前完成撤军、阿富汗抵抗力量立场强硬和喀布尔当局担心难以维持统治的情况下发表的。
