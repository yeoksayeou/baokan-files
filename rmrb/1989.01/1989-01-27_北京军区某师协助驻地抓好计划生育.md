	Beijing Military Region's Certain Division Assists Local Authorities in Implementing Family Planning

	This division of the Beijing Military Region has actively assisted local governments in promoting population policies and knowledge about optimal childbearing and child-rearing as part of their joint military-civilian construction activities. They also provide voluntary consultations and reliable, high-quality services to local residents. By the end of 1988, all 143 joint construction points in the division had achieved a 100% late marriage rate and one-child rate for three consecutive years, earning them the titles of county, municipal, and national advanced units in family planning.

	Since 1985, this division has engaged in joint military-civilian construction activities with 115 villages and towns, 22 factories, streets, and 6 schools in 7 districts and counties of Beijing. They discovered that early marriages and overpopulation were on the rise, and consanguineous marriages were increasing in mountainous areas. Therefore, they decided to make family planning a key component of their joint construction efforts. Over the past three years, the division has dispatched more than 2,300 officers, soldiers, and medical personnel from various departments to form propaganda teams. They used posters, bulletin boards, radio lectures, technical consultations, and party and league classes to educate villagers, factory workers, and street residents about population policies and optimal childbearing and child-rearing knowledge. In three years, the division produced 21 sets of slides, 76 video tapes, 75 physical specimens, 1,500 posters and photos, and printed 21,800 propaganda and guidance materials, reaching an audience of 278,000 people. By the end of 1988, all 21,208 women of childbearing age under 35 years old in the joint construction points had voluntarily adopted long-term contraceptive measures. In the 27 joint construction villages in the deep mountains of Changping, Huairou, Miyun, and Pinggu counties, consanguineous marriages were relatively common, and many children had low intelligence. The division's family planning leading group selected 21 medical personnel with rich theoretical knowledge and business skills from the medical department to conduct long-term propaganda and medical treatment in these joint construction points, helping residents understand the dangers of consanguineous marriages.

	In the joint construction process, the division also paid special attention to providing technical services for optimal childbearing and child-rearing. Over the past three years, they have used comprehensive methods such as pregnancy group registration, follow-up surveys, conversation records, and pregnancy tests to establish reproductive and contraceptive archives and pregnancy registration cards for more than 21,400 women of childbearing age.

　　北京军区某师协助驻地抓好计划生育
    本报讯  北京军区某师在军民共建活动中，积极协助当地政府做好人口政策及优生优育知识宣传教育，并且向当地群众义务咨询、提供安全、可靠的优质服务。截至１９８８年底，全师１４３个共建点晚婚率、一胎率连续３年达１００％，分别被评为县、市和全国计划生育先进单位。
    １９８５年以来，这个师先后与北京市７个区、县的１１５个乡村，２２个工厂、街道、６所学校开展军民共建活动。他们发现当地早婚、超生现象抬头，山区近亲婚恋有增无减，于是决定将计划生育作为军民共建的重要内容。３年来，全师先后从机关部队及医务部门抽调干部、战士２３００多人次，组成宣讲组，利用板报、墙报、广播讲座、技术咨询和上党、团课等形式，向村镇院户、工厂街道的群众进行人口政策及优生优育知识宣传。３年中，全师为计划生育宣传制作幻灯片２１部，录相片７６盘，实物标本７５份，挂图、照片１５００多幅，印发宣传辅导材料２１８００多份，受众达２７．８万多人次。截至１９８８年底，所有共建点的２１２０８名只有一个孩子的３５岁以下育龄妇女自愿采取了长效节育措施。地处昌平、怀柔、密云、平谷４县深山的２７个共建乡村，近亲联姻较为普遍，不少儿童智力低下。师计划生育领导小组从医务部门选调２１名业务精、理论知识丰富的医务骨干，长期到这些共建点边巡诊、边开展宣传，使群众较多地了解近亲结婚的危害性。
    这个师在共建中还特别注意做好优生优育的技术服务工作。３年来，他们通过孕情编组、随访调查、谈话登记、妊娠化验等综合方法，先后为２１４００多名育龄妇女建立了生节育档案和孕情登记卡片。
