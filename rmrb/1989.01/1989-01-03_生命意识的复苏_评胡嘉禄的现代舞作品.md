This autumn, Shanghai dancer Hu Jialu, known for his modern dance designs, presented an evening of modern dance to the audience, leaving a deep impression.

As early as the autumn of 1983, Hu Jialu had already staged a "Youth Song and Dance Evening"; works such as "Friendship," "Country Path," and "The Call of Ideals" in the evening, with their fresh and simple dance style, not only laid the foundation for his "Youth Dance" style, but also, in the specific historical context of the time, almost became a symbol of the young generation's joy and enthusiasm, breaking free from the shackles of old habits. After that, the complex desires and spiritual burdens that Hu Jialu carried in his heart drove him to wander between the intersections of "tradition and modernity," where old thinking habits were collapsing and new ideas were sprouting, and prompted him to strive to change his experience of dance space and movement. This led to the later works "Rope Waves," which revealed the "crisis" of modern family life, and "Reflections on a Chess Game," which more abstractly symbolized the human historical situation. Compared to Hu Jialu's early works, he had changed from purely sensory creation to a deeper level of abstract conception, consciously exploring "modern themes" and "modern dance techniques." Although these two works still had tendencies of stereotyped imagery and overly explicit ideas, the determinacy of the works' meaning had already loosened, and the spatial form and composition of the movements showed strong vitality.

As a sensitive and mature dancer, Hu Jialu's three works this year, "Blood Sinking," "The Other Shore," and "Solitary," have made those who truly want to experience the sensitive points of contemporary Chinese culture and feel the "avant-garde attitude" of modern dance take notice. Whether it is the expression of prehistoric consciousness, sex, and the cycle of life in "Blood Sinking," or the metaphor of the crisis of contemporary urban life, the anxiety of modern people, the situation of survival, and the search for spiritual communication in "The Other Shore" and "Solitary," they both allow us to appreciate a contradiction of our era as seen through the bodies of dancers, and also leave us with thoughts that feel quite familiar. Uncovering the ideological context behind Hu Jialu's dance practice, we can discover a series of new messages: Hu Jialu's dance practice begins to consciously distinguish itself from traditional dance creation methods, while at the same time, it strives to avoid merely resembling European and American modern dance in form. "Blood Sinking," "The Other Shore," and "Solitary" represent Hu Jialu's true entry into the exploration of ideas and imagery, the space and time of dance, and the potential for dance to dialogue with the world.

Any work of art is a child of its time, and modern art cannot be completely detached from tradition. True works of art are always both rooted in historical and cultural soil and attempt to break through the historical limitations and all spiritual obstacles of a specific stage of traditional culture; at the same time, they strive to become the cradle of new era emotions. Looking at the history of modern dance worldwide, we can summarize a line: on the one hand, it is connected with Western civilization and classical ballet history, and on the other hand, it represents a process of continuous breakthrough and transformation of dance thought that has already become a fixed pattern. It can be said that Hu Jialu's works are striving on this line, and casting a strong light of modern dance on the sensitive points of era contradictions, making it always seem like a technique that constantly causes trouble for "patterns and definite meanings," a provocation against "normal and relaxed thinking habits."

From the current state and artistic trends of modern dance in China, whether it is some of the works that have already appeared on the stage in recent years, or the modern dance foundation construction that has begun in the Guangzhou Dance School's modern dance class, especially this "Hu Jialu Modern Dance Works Evening," it all shows that as a product of cultural vanguard consciousness, modern dance can be transplanted and integrated into the open regional culture of contemporary China. In fact, as a world art belonging to a specific era, modern dance has already formed a phenomenon that transcends national boundaries in its creation and aesthetic consciousness.

　　生命意识的复苏
    ——评胡嘉禄的现代舞作品
    黄麒
    今年秋季，以从事现代舞设计而闻名的上海舞蹈家胡嘉禄，奉献给观众一台现代舞蹈作品，给人们留下深刻的印象。
    早在１９８３年的同一季节，胡嘉禄就推出过一台“青春歌舞晚会”；其中的《友爱》、《乡间小路》、《理想的呼唤》等作品以一股清新、质朴的舞风，不仅奠定了他“青春派舞蹈”的地基，而且，“青春歌舞晚会”本身在当时特定历史境况下，几乎成了年轻一代欢欣鼓舞、身心突破陈规陋习之樊篱的象征。这以后，复杂的生活愿望和精神负载在胡嘉禄身心中所生成的冲动，迫使他开始徘徊在“传统与现代”交汇，旧的思维习惯瓦解和新的观念丛生的边缘，并促使他竭力企求改变一下对舞蹈时空和运动方式的体验。这就有了后来揭示现代家庭生活“危机”的《绳波》，和更为抽象地隐喻人类历史境况的《对弈随想曲》。跟胡嘉禄早期作品相比，他已一改纯粹感性的创作，而深化到一种抽象构思的层面，有意识地对“现代主题”和“现代舞技巧”进行探索。这两部作品虽然在形象的塑造上仍有模式化和观念过于直露的倾向，但作品涵义的确定性因素业已松动，动作的空间形式和构图造型显示出较强的活力。
    作为一个敏感而成熟的舞蹈家，胡嘉禄今年推出的三部作品《血沉》、《彼岸》和《独白》，使真正想体验当代中国文化敏感点和感受现代舞“前卫心态”的观众刮目相看。无论是《血沉》中对史前意识、性以及生命之轮回的表现，还是《彼岸》和《独白》中对当代都市生活危机、现代人的焦虑、生存境况和寻求心灵沟通的隐喻，都既使我们领略到一种由舞蹈着的人体透视出的我们所处时代的矛盾，又留给我们颇感亲近的思想暗示。揭开胡嘉禄舞蹈实践历程背后的思想脉络，我们可以发现一系列新的信息：胡嘉禄的舞蹈实践开始有意识地同传统舞蹈创作方式作出区别，与此同时，也竭力回避仅仅与欧美现代舞在形式上的相似。《血沉》、《彼岸》和《独白》代表着胡嘉禄在意念和形象的把握上，在舞蹈发生的时空以及展示舞蹈与世界对话的潜力上开始真正迈入探索的历程。
    任何艺术品都是时代的产儿，而现代艺术也不可能全然与传统绝缘。真正的艺术品总是既源之于历史文化土壤，又企图突破传统文化具体阶段的历史局限性和一切精神上的障碍；同时还努力成为孕育新的时代情感的摇篮。纵观世界现代舞实践的历程，我们可以归纳出一条线：它一方面与西方文明和古典芭蕾史相连，另一方面则表现为对业已成为定势的舞蹈思想不断进行突破与变革的进程。可以说，胡嘉禄的作品正是在这样一条线上努力，而且将现代舞蹈强有力的光圈投射在时代矛盾的敏感点上，使它总像是一种给“模式和确定性意义”不断制造麻烦的技巧，一种针对“正常轻松的思想习惯”的冒犯。
    从中国现代舞的现状和艺术倾向来看，无论是近年来已在舞台出现过的一些作品，还是广州舞蹈学校现代舞班开始进行的现代舞基础建设，尤其是这次“胡嘉禄现代舞作品晚会”都表明，作为一种文化先锋意识的产物，现代舞能够移植并融汇到当代中国开放性的地域文化之中。其实现代舞作为一种属于特定时代的世界性艺术，它在创作和审美意识方面已经形成了一种超越国界的现象。
