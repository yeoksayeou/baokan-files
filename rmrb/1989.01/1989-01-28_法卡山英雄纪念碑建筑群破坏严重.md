In Ningming County, Guangxi, in the town of Xiaoshi, stands a monument commemorating the 1981 battle in which our army recaptured Phu Lam Mountain. This monument was erected in 1986, but after just over two years, it has suffered severe damage: the front steps of the monument have twelve iron chains connected to concrete pillars on either side, ten of which have been destroyed. Around the monument, there are forty-three concrete pillars with a diameter of twenty centimeters, nine of which have been damaged, some removed, and others broken in half. To the right of the monument, a six-square-meter platform made of concrete blocks has been completely dismantled, leaving only an empty site. Thirty-seven marble slabs embedded in the four walls of the monument have been peeled off, and the names of six out of 154 martyrs are missing. A mother statue cast in fiberglass on the monument also has two holes in it. We appeal to the relevant departments to take effective measures as soon as possible to protect the Phu Lam Mountain Heroic Memorial.

　　法卡山英雄纪念碑建筑群破坏严重
    在广西宁明县夏石镇，矗立着一座纪念一九八一年六月我军收复法卡山战斗的英雄纪念碑。这座纪念碑建于一九八六年，刚过了两年多，却遭到了严重的破坏：纪念碑前沿台阶两侧共有十二根与水泥柱相连的铁索，竟有十根被破坏。纪念碑四周共有四十三根直径为二十厘米的钢筋水泥柱，有九处被破坏，有的被人拆除，有的被拦腰折断。纪念碑右侧一个面积为六平方米由水泥块拼成的平台全被拆走，只留下一片空旷的遗址。镶嵌在纪念碑四壁的大理石，被揭走三十七块，一百五十四名烈士中有六人的英名找不到了。纪念碑上有座用玻璃钢铸成的母亲雕像，也被弄了两个窟窿。呼吁有关部门尽快采取有效措施，保护法卡山英雄纪念碑。
