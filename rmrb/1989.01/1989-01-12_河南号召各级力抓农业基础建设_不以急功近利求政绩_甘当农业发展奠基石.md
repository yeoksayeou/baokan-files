Henan Calls for Strengthening Agricultural Infrastructure

    Henan Calls for Strengthening Agricultural Infrastructure
    Avoiding Short-Term Gains for Political Achievements, Dedicated to Laying the Foundation for Agricultural Development

    The People's Daily reports: Correspondent Li Erliang reports: To achieve agricultural harvests, one must rely on solid infrastructure work, rather than pursuing short-term gains and superficial achievements. This was the important thought reflected at the recent rural work conference held in Henan.

    Governor Cheng Weigao admonished the attending leaders at various levels: "It is better to not achieve any remarkable accomplishments during one's term, but to truly start from the long-term and fundamental interests of the 80 million people of Henan, to invest effort and money, to do a good job in agricultural basic work, infrastructure, and grassroots construction. Lay a good foundation for the next generation and the next government to achieve a breakthrough in agriculture." In Henan, a major agricultural province, how to handle the relationship between concentrating efforts on the present and laying a solid foundation for the future is a concern for the broad masses of cadres and the people. This provincial rural work conference emphasized the importance of agricultural infrastructure. The Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government made it clear to cadres at all levels: Agricultural development must not be pursued with short-term gains in mind, and even more, it must not be for the sake of showing off so-called achievements during one's term, spending energy on superficial matters, and not paying attention to the basic work of agriculture. It is hoped that cadres at all levels will have the spirit of being the foundation stone for agricultural development.

    The Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government also require that Party committees and governments at all levels fully utilize the results of agricultural surveys and agricultural zoning to do a good job in comprehensive planning. After the planning is determined through argumentation, it should be persisted in with the spirit of Yugong moving the mountain, without stopping. Even if the cadres change, the planning must be adhered to and cannot be "changed with the change of leadership." In the future, the evaluation of achievements and cadres will take the good or bad performance of agricultural basic work as an important content of the evaluation of good or bad achievements.

    At this conference, the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government made arrangements and implementations on how to solidly grasp agricultural infrastructure from various aspects such as funds, projects, and manpower.

　　河南号召各级力抓农业基础建设
    不以急功近利求政绩  甘当农业发展奠基石
    本报讯  记者李而亮报道：夺取农业丰收，要依靠扎实的基础建设工作，而不是急功近利作表面文章，这是河南省最近召开的农村工作会议上体现的重要思想。
    省长程维高告诫与会的各级领导干部：“宁可在自己任期之内搞不出什么显赫的成就，也要真正从河南８０００万人民长远的根本的利益出发，下功夫，花本钱，把农业基础工作、基础建设、基层建设搞好。为后人、为下届政府实现农业突破打下一个良好基础”。在河南这样一个农业大省，如何处理好集中力量忙当前和打好基础为将来的关系，是广大干部群众关心的问题，这次召开的全省农村工作会议，把农业基础建设放到高度位置上来强调。省委、省政府向各级干部明确：抓农业决不能急功近利，更不能为了在自己任期内显示一下所谓政绩，把精力花在表面文章上，不注意抓农业的基础工作。希望各级干部要有甘当农业发展奠基石的精神。
    省委、省政府还要求各级党委、政府充分运用农业调查和农业区划成果，搞好全面规划。规划论证确定之后，要以愚公挖山不止的精神，长期不懈坚持下去，即使干部变动，规划也必须坚持，不能“领导一动，规划重弄”。今后考核政绩，考核干部，要把农业基础工作搞得好坏作为政绩优劣的一项重要内容。
    在这次会议上，省委、省政府就如何扎实抓好农业基础建设，从资金、项目、人力等各方面进行了布置落实。
