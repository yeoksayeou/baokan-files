	After the Girlfriend "Broke Up"...
	Soldier Xiao Cao of a certain regiment in the Nanjing Military Region had a girlfriend before he enlisted in the army. The girl was his classmate. They grew up together and were deeply in love. After graduating from middle school, Xiao Cao enlisted in the army, and the girl saw him off to the village entrance, saying with deep affection, "Go and fulfill your duty, I'll wait for you."

	After Xiao Cao enlisted, they exchanged letters frequently, encouraging each other. The following year, Xiao Cao became a squad leader in the army and was named an "Outstanding Soldier." The girl also got into the China University of Mining and Technology. Their careers should have made this love blossom even more, but instead, it quickly withered. After the girl entered the university, her love for Xiao Cao gradually cooled. Last year, she wrote to say she wanted to break up with Xiao Cao. The unexpected blow made Xiao Cao extremely distressed, but he did not write back to blame the girl, nor did he become depressed. Instead, he proved his determination to the girl through hard work. He applied to take the self-study exam for the legal profession in higher education and spent all his spare time studying legal books. The girl, thinking that Xiao Cao was not responding to her breakup letter, assumed he was playing tricks. She sent another long letter mocking him. Xiao Cao still treated this letter with an open mind. He quietly put the letter in his diary, using it to motivate himself.

	Soon, his two closest friends from his hometown, Xiao Li and Xiao Wang, accidentally saw this letter. They felt it was a great humiliation and both had the same idea: to stand up for Xiao Cao! Xiao Li drew more than ten obscene cartoons with the girl's name on them in the dormitory; Xiao Wang secretly developed more than ten prints of the girl's photo that Xiao Cao had asked him to develop. They planned to take the obscene cartoons to the university and their hometown in Jiangsu to post everywhere; they would send the photos to various newspapers to publish "marriage ads" and "missing person ads," determined to make her infamous and unable to show her face.

	When Xiao Li and Xiao Wang announced their "strategic plan" to Xiao Cao, he grabbed his two friends: "This can't be done! This is a criminal act."

	After persuading his friends, Xiao Cao felt the importance of learning and using the law. The girl sent a letter full of apologies.

　　对象“吹”了以后……
    南京军区某团战士小曹入伍前在江苏老家谈了个对象。姑娘是他的同班同学。两人青梅竹马，情投意合。中学毕业后，小曹报名参军，姑娘把他送到村口，情深意长：“安心尽义务吧，我等你。”
    小曹入伍后，两人情书不断，互相勉励。第二年，小曹在部队当上了班长，被评为“优秀士兵”，姑娘也考进了中国矿业学院。事业的发展本该使这支爱情花朵更妍，没想到它却迅速凋零。姑娘进了矿业学院后，对小曹的爱渐渐变冷。去年，她来信表示要和小曹分手。意外的打击使小曹精神上极度苦恼，但他并没有写信责备姑娘，也没有消沉，而是用奋发进取向姑娘证明自己的志向。他报名参加了高教法律专业自学考试，把业余时间全部用来钻研法律书籍。姑娘见“吹灯”信发出后没有反应，以为小曹想耍赖，又寄来一封洋洋千言的挖苦信。小曹仍然以豁达的胸怀对待这封来信。他把信悄悄地夹在日记本里，以此激励自己。
    不久，他的两位最要好的老乡小李和小王偶尔看到了这封信，认为这是奇耻大辱，不约而同产生一个念头：给小曹打抱不平！小李回宿舍画了十多幅注有姑娘名字的污秽漫画；小王连夜将小曹曾托他洗印的姑娘的底片洗印１０多张。两人打算将污秽漫画带到矿业学院和江苏老家四处张贴；照片寄到各报社刊登“征婚启事”和“寻人启事”，非把她搞得臭名远扬、无脸见人不可。当小李和小王一起向小曹宣布他们的“战略计划”时，小曹一把拽住两位老乡：“这不行啊！这是犯罪行为。”
    说服老乡之后，小曹深感学法用法的重要。姑娘捎来了充满歉意的信。   朱国成
