The Xining Municipal People's Procuratorate announced on January 11 that Liu Guangqian, former vice mayor of Xining, who was responsible for the overall management of the major accident that occurred during the Lantern Festival in Xining last year, has been indicted by the Xining Municipal People's Procuratorate to the Xining Intermediate People's Court.

The Xining Municipal People's Procuratorate also decided to drop the charges against Zhao Hua, former director of the Xining Municipal Public Security Bureau, who was responsible for the safety of the Lantern Festival.

On the evening of March 2, 1988, a major accident occurred during the Lantern Festival in Xining, resulting in 18 deaths and 119 injuries due to overcrowding and the organizers' serious neglect of safety and security measures.

After six months of investigation, the Xining Municipal People's Procuratorate concluded that Liu Guangqian, who was in charge of organizing and leading the Lantern Festival, and Zhao Hua, who was responsible for the safety and security of the event, both bore direct responsibility for the accident. Their actions constituted dereliction of duty, a criminal offense.
