	Zhou Jiahua said at the national civil aviation work conference that managing civil aviation requires iron discipline. The urgent task is to address safety and service quality issues.

	Xinhua News Agency reporter Guo Junzheng and People's Daily reporter Zhang Guorong reported from Beijing on January 24: State Councilor Zhou Jiahua said at the national civil aviation work conference, which concluded today, that in recent years, China's civil aviation has significantly increased its strength. The main tasks at hand are to address the issues in safety and service work.

	Zhou Jiahua said that over the past decade, China's civil aviation transport turnover has nearly tripled; more than 100 aircraft have been added, and over 30 large and medium-sized airports have been built. Last year, the labor productivity of the entire civil aviation sector reached 70,000 yuan, and the per capita foreign exchange earnings were $10,000. These achievements are not easy to come by.

	Zhou Jiahua pointed out that the prominent issues facing civil aviation currently are: first, the safety situation is very severe; second, service work, especially ground service work, has many shortcomings, and there are many inadequacies in management and infrastructure that do not meet the demands.

	Zhou Jiahua emphasized that civil aviation plays an irreplaceable role in China's transportation industry. It is crucial for improving China's investment environment, developing the tourism industry, and enhancing friendly exchanges with foreign countries.

	Zhou Jiahua said that based on these characteristics, I fully agree with the guiding ideology of "strictness first, iron discipline" for managing civil aviation. Civil aviation must improve its service work and wholeheartedly serve the passengers, setting a high standard. This high standard means not just comparing ourselves to ourselves or other domestic transportation service industries, but aiming to match or even surpass the international service standards of airlines around the world. We must ensure that China's civil aviation services meet the requirements of safety, punctuality, and high efficiency. Civil aviation flights must be on time. If they cannot take off on time due to weather or other reasons, we must increase transparency in our work and gain the understanding and cooperation of the passengers.

　　邹家华在全国民航工作会议上说    
    治理民航要用铁的纪律    
    当务之急解决安全和服务质量问题
    本报北京１月２４日讯  新华社记者郭君正、本报记者张国荣报道：国务委员邹家华在今天结束的全国民航工作会议上说，近年来我国民航的实力获得了明显增加，当前面临的主要任务是要解决好安全和服务工作中的问题。
    邹家华说，１０年来我国民航运输总周转量翻了近三番；增加了１００多架飞机，修建了３０多个大中型机场。去年民航全员劳动生产率达到７万元，人均创汇１万美元。这些成绩的取得是很不容易的。
    邹家华说，当前民航存在的突出问题，一是安全形势很严峻；二是服务工作尤其地面服务工作有许多不足，在管理和基础设施上有许多不适应。
    邹家华指出，民航在我国交通运输业中有着不可替代的作用，对于改善我国投资环境，发展旅游事业，增进中外友好交往，有时甚至是举足轻重的作用。
    邹家华说，基于这些特点，我很赞成“严字当头，铁的纪律”，治民航要严的指导思想。民航一定要搞好服务工作，要全心全意为旅客服务，树立一个高标准。所谓高标准，就是不能只是自己同自己比，不能光同国内其他运输服务行业比，而是要瞄准世界各国航空公司的国际服务水平，尽快赶上或超过他们。要使我国民航的服务符合安全正点、优质高效的要求。民航飞行要正点，如果遇到天气等原因不能正点起飞，也要增加工作的透明度，取得旅客的理解和配合。
