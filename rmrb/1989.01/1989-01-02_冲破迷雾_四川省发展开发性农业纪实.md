Recently, in an activity to select the top 10 events of the decade of reform, Sichuan Province, as one of the provinces that first carried out rural reforms nationwide, was ranked first among the top 10 events selected.

However, in recent years, grain production has not made much progress, agricultural investment lacks momentum, and agricultural production materials are expensive and scarce. These issues have left people feeling as if they are in a thick fog...

Regarding this, the broad masses of rural cadres and villagers in Sichuan Province have been confused and hesitant, but more importantly, they have been steadfast in their exploration and pioneering efforts.

A Decision After Balancing the Books

To feed 1/10 of the country's population on 1/16 of the nation's arable land, this is the most basic situation in Sichuan Province.

A large number of surplus labor can continue to flow out, but due to increasing competition, its development is subject to many limitations; township enterprises, under the premise of a weak foundation, also find it difficult to absorb a large number of surplus labor in a short period.

People have turned their attention back to the land beneath their feet: although the province has little arable land, half of the 95 million mu of arable land is low-yielding; there are also 34.46 million mu of barren hills suitable for afforestation, 74.856 million mu of unused land, and 9.5 million mu of water surfaces, all of which are potential advantages. If, on the premise of ensuring the stable increase in per-unit-area yield of existing arable land, great efforts are made to develop the aforementioned "several barren lands," it is possible to create enormous material wealth. Taking the transformation of 31.6 million mu of low-yielding fields as an example, if the yield can be raised to the level of medium-yielding fields, the province can increase grain production by 31.6 billion catties per year.

For this reason, the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee and the provincial government quickly formulated the rural development policy of "developing around advantages and reforming around development," and issued a series of corresponding policies: clearly stipulating the stabilization of the contract responsibility system for mountain forests, water surfaces, river beaches, and other resources, adhering to the principle of "who develops, who operates, who benefits"; for the development of non-arable land for planting, agricultural tax and agricultural and forestry special product tax can be exempted for 5 years, etc.

The above policies have effectively mobilized the enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers. According to statistics, in the past two years, the province has had at least 40 million rural laborers engaged in developmental agriculture each year; just the transformation of low-yielding fields alone has required 180 million man-days of labor.

Creating High Efficiency in a New Space

A famous economist asserted: if agriculture can become an efficient industry, then farmers will be talented businessmen.

"There are many tricks in the rice fields, it all depends on how you do it." Danbao County Shima Village farmers Wang Wenqing and Wang Guozhong, father and son, told the reporter. Last year, they used the two months of idle time between harvesting rice and planting rapeseed to grow mushrooms in the fields and succeeded. In 0.4 mu of land, they harvested 200 catties of rice, 18 catties of rapeseed, 250 catties of potatoes, and 778 catties of mushrooms, earning 1,998 yuan, with a total income of 5,470 yuan per mu.

Wang Wenqing and his son's practice is a microcosm of Sichuan Province's broad masses of farmers striving to tap the potential of grain production. According to incomplete statistics, Sichuan Province implemented the "Rice-Fish High-Yield Plan" on 1.05 million mu of land last year, with an average yield of over 500 catties of rice per mu, while also providing 30,000 tons of fresh fish to the market, increasing farmers' income by 180 million yuan.

Chongxing Village in Baoxing County, located in a high-altitude mountainous area, cultivated 3,750 mu of medicinal herbs on the mountaintop at an altitude of 2,400 meters. Last year, they produced 600,000 catties of medicinal materials, with a total income of 1.89 million yuan. Just this one item alone, the per capita net income can reach 1,860 yuan; last year, 1/3 of the 120 households in the village earned more than 10,000 yuan from medicinal materials, and the entire village became prosperous.

The people of 13 counties and districts in Leshan City use their courtyards for planting, breeding, and processing, with courtyard economics accounting for approximately 1/3 of the total social output value of rural areas in the city the previous year, with 20% of households earning more than half of their total income from courtyard economics.

A large number of high-efficiency examples have attracted Sichuan farmers to showcase their skills in developmental agriculture. In the past two years, the province has planted 2.89 million mu of fruit trees, built and improved 1.9 million mu of grasslands, transformed 2.12 million mu of low-yielding fields, and planted 20 million mu of forests in patches, successively achieving significant economic and social benefits. They have realized in practice that agriculture is not without potential, but has great potential to be tapped. As long as one is willing to sweat on this land, wealth will be at one's feet!

Investment: Squeeze, Dig, and Pull

Developmental agriculture is a new industry, and compared to some industries that already have a certain foundation, it has higher and more urgent requirements for basic investment. However, under the current situation where all aspects need investment and the state's finances are tight, how can the investment in developmental agriculture, especially financial investment, be increased?

Regarding this, the rural cadres and masses in Sichuan Province have also been troubled and hesitant, but they quickly understood the difficulties of the state, did not wait or rely on others, and solved the problem of investment in developmental agriculture with their own strength, taking the "three-step" approach of squeezing, digging, and pulling.

The so-called "squeezing" refers to farmers squeezing out as much money as possible from their own income for developmental commercial agriculture. In recent years, Sichuan farmers have shown great enthusiasm for investing in developmental agriculture. The previous year, the per capita net income of rural areas in Sichuan was 369.46 yuan, which was 20.13% lower than the national average rural per capita net income; however, Sichuan farmers' investment in agricultural production reached 159.96 yuan, which was 6.31% higher than the national average household production investment ratio. In the past three years, the province has invested 150 million yuan in fruit planting, fish farming, and the transformation of medium and low-yielding fields, with 60% of the funds coming from the masses.

The so-called "digging" refers to digging into the financial potential of townships, villages, and collective organizations for the supporting services of developmental agriculture. Since last spring, Sichuan Province has mobilized 490,000 people to clean up the finances of township and village collective organizations, initially conducting a statistical survey of 3.54 billion yuan of collective assets. On this basis, the province has integrated the financial resources of rural collective assets, added the support funds of township and village enterprises, and established a unified rural collective cooperative fund. The province has already established cooperative funds in 147 counties, accounting for 71% of the total number of counties; raised 132 million yuan, with more than half of it already invested in commercial developmental agriculture.

The so-called "pulling" refers to attracting funds from various aspects of society through horizontal economic cooperation. The farmers of Meishan County took advantage of the advantages of the crisscrossing rivers and canals the previous year to build 26,000 square meters of net cage fish farming, producing nearly 800,000 catties of fish. Before National Day, when some farmers loaded fresh fish in cars to sell in some large enterprises in Chengdu City, many people were attracted by these lively carp. The fish farmers said, "If you want to eat fish, there is plenty, but you need to invest some money." Last year, the fish farming industry in Meishan County attracted 9 million yuan from provincial, municipal, and county government agencies, factories, troops, and colleges and universities. These investors either share profits with the fish farmers or compensate with fish, benefiting all parties. According to statistics from the Leshan City Agricultural Commission, last year, the fish farming industry in Pengshan, Meishan, Qingshen, and other five districts and counties "pulled" in 20.3 million yuan. The city's intensive fish farming area increased by 1.45 times compared to the previous year.

　　冲破迷雾
　　——四川省发展开发性农业纪实
    新华社记者  熊小立  王满
    最近，在一次改革１０年大事评选活动中，四川省作为全国率先进行农村改革的省份之一而名列所评１０件大事的榜首。
    但是，近几年粮食生产却进展不大，农业投入后劲不足，农用生产资料价高货少……这些，使人如坠十里雾中……
    对此，四川省广大农村干部群众惶惑过，徘徊过，但是更多的是坚毅的探索和开拓。
    一笔账后的抉择
    要在占全国耕地面积１／１６的耕地上养活占全国１／１０的人口，这便是四川省最基本的省情。
    大量的剩余劳力可以继续向外流动，但是由于竞争日益激烈，其发展受诸多条件限制；乡镇企业也在基础薄弱的前提下，难以在短时期内大量消化剩余劳力。
    人们把眼光重新复归到脚下的土地：全省耕地虽少，但９５００万亩耕地中中低产田占一半；还有宜林荒山３４４６万多亩，尚未利用的土地７４８５．６万亩，水面９５０多万亩，这些都是潜在的优势。如果在保证现有耕地单位面积产量稳定增长的前提下，下大力气开发上述“几荒”，就可能创造出巨大的物质财富。仅以３１６０万亩低产田的改造为例，如能提高到中产田的水平，全省每年就能增产３１．６亿公斤粮食。
    为此，四川省委和省政府迅速制定出“围绕优势搞开发，围绕开发搞改革”的农村发展方针，并颁布一系列相应的政策：明确规定稳定山林、水面、河滩等资源的承包责任制，坚持谁开发、谁经营、谁得益的原则；对开发非耕地从事种植业的，５年内可免交农业税和农林特产税等等。
    上述政策有效地调动了广大农民的积极性。据统计，近两年来，全省每年至少有４００万农村劳力投入开发性农业；仅改造低产田土一项就投工１．８亿个。
    在新时空内创造高效益　　
    一位著名经济学家断言：如果使农业成为有效益的产业，那么农民将是天才的经营家。
    “粮田里的名堂大得很，就看你怎么弄法。”丹梭县石马村农民王文清、王国忠父子俩告诉记者。去年，他们利用收了水稻和种油菜前的两个月空闲时间，在田里种蘑菇获得成功。在０．４亩的田里，他们除收水稻２００公斤、油菜１８公斤、土豆２５０公斤外，还收蘑菇７７８公斤，收入１９９８元，折合亩收入共５４７０元。
    王文清父子俩的实践正是四川省广大农民努力挖掘粮田生产潜力的一个缩影。据不完全统计，四川省去年仅实施“稻鱼丰产计划”就达１０５万亩，稻谷平均亩产超过５００公斤，同时还为市场提供３万吨鲜鱼，农民增收１．８亿元。　
    位于高寒山区的宝兴县崇兴村在２４００米高的山顶上开荒种药３７５０亩，去年可产药材６０万公斤，总收入达１８９万元，仅此一项，人均纯收入可达１８６０元；全村１２０户农民去年仅药材收入在万元以上的就占１／３以上，全村一举脱贫致富。
    乐山市１３个县区的群众利用庭院搞种植、养殖和加工业，前年庭院经济收入约占全市农村社会总产值的１／３，其中２０％的农户庭院经济收入超过总收入的一半。
    一大批高效益的典型，吸引着四川农民在开发性农业中一显身手。近两年里，全省共种植果树２８９万亩，新建和改良草场１９０万亩，改造低产田２１２万亩，成片造林２０００多万亩，陆续获得可观的经济效益和社会效益。他们在实践中体会到，农业并不是没有搞头了，而是大有潜力可挖，只要肯把辛勤的汗水洒在这片土地上，财富就在脚下！
    投入，一靠挤二靠挖三靠拉
    开发性农业是一项新兴的产业，与一些已有一定基础的行业相比，对基本投入的要求更高、更迫切。然而，在目前各方面都需要投入而国家财政又很紧张的情况下，如何增加开发性农业的投入，特别是资金投入呢？
    对此，四川省农村干部群众也有过苦恼和犹豫，但他们很快就体谅到国家的困难，不等不靠，以自己的力量解决开发农业投入这一难题，走出一挤二挖三拉的“三步曲”。　　
    所谓挤，就是农民从自身收入中尽可能多地挤出资金用于开发性商品农业。近年来，四川农民对开发农业投入予以极大热情，前年全省农村人均纯收入３６９．４６元，比全国农村人均纯收入低２０．１３％；可是四川农民用于农业生产的投入就达１５９．９６元，比全国农户生产性投入的比重高６．３１％。近３年间，全省用于种果、养鱼、改造中低产田的投入达１．５亿元，其中群众自筹部分占６０％。
    所谓挖，就是挖掘乡、村、集体组织的资金潜力，用于开发农业的配套服务。去年春天以来，四川省动员４９万人对乡、村集体财务进行清理，初步把３５．４亿元的集体资产进行了统计。在此基础上，全省各地把农村集体资产中的资金融通，加上乡村企业的支农资金，统一建立农村集体合作基金会。全省已有１４７个县建立了合作基金会，占总县数的７１％；筹集资金１．３２亿元，其中一多半已投入到商品性开发农业中。
    所谓拉，就是通过横向经济联合，吸引社会各方面的资金。眉山县农民前年利用河渠纵横的优势，搞网箱养鱼２．６万平方米，产成鱼近８０万公斤。国庆前夕，当一些农户用汽车载着鲜鱼去成都市的一些大企业卖鱼时，许多人被这些活鲜鲜的鲤鱼吸引住。鱼农说：“要吃鱼，有的是，就是要投点资。”去年，眉山县养鱼业从省、市、县机关和厂矿、部队及大专院校吸引来９０万元。这些投资者有的与养鱼户利润分成，有的以鱼补偿，各方都受益。据乐山市农委统计，去年彭山、眉山、青神等５个区县的养鱼业就“拉”来资金２０３万元。全市集约化养鱼面积比前年增加１．４５倍。
    农民群众的创造，使四川省农业资金投入渠道开掘出一个良好的开端。
