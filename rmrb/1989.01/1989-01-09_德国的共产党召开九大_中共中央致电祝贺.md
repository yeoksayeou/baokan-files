The Communist Party of Germany held its Ninth Congress from January 6 to 8 in Frankfurt, West Germany. The congress was attended by 651 delegates representing the party's 47,000-plus members. Representatives from 52 foreign communist parties or other organizations also participated. Wang Qingyu, Charge d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in West Germany, attended the congress on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

On January 3, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China sent a congratulatory message to the Ninth Congress of the Communist Party of Germany. The message stated that the Communist Party of Germany has long been dedicated to uniting the progressive and democratic forces in the Federal Republic of Germany and tirelessly fighting for social progress and democratic rights for the working people. We are pleased to see that, in recent years, our two parties have established and developed friendly relations based on Marxism, independent self-reliance, equality, mutual respect, and non-interference in each other's internal affairs. We are confident that continuing to develop the relationship between the two parties will also contribute to the friendship between the two countries and their peoples.

The congress re-elected Herbert Mies as the chairman of the Communist Party of Germany.
