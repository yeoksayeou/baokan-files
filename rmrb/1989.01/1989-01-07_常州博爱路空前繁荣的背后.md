The short stretch of Bo'ai Road, home to the Changzhou Electrical and Mechanical Equipment Company, has seen unprecedented prosperity in recent years. Over just 500 meters, there are 39 shops selling electrical and mechanical products, earning it the nickname "Electrical and Mechanical Street." Many individual proprietors have obtained collective licenses, and their prices are generally much higher than those of the Changzhou Electrical and Mechanical Equipment Company. However, these shops still attract a large number of customers. To uncover the mystery, we recently conducted an on-site investigation.

We first visited the Li Da Trading Department and requested 2,300 sets of three different types of bearings. The price at this shop was 3,520 yuan higher than at the Changzhou Electrical and Mechanical Equipment Company, but they offered us a 3% rebate. A Mr. Yao from the shop said, "Each bearing can be marked up by 3 jiao, and this money will be paid to you directly in cash." This surprised us greatly; if we were indeed procurement agents, we could easily earn a commission of 1,668 yuan without any effort. Subsequently, we went to the Mao Xing Hardware and Electrical Appliances Shop and requested a 120-kilowatt diesel generator set made in Shanghai. The shop had no stock, but they immediately contacted the Changzhou Electrical and Mechanical Equipment Company, saying it could be delivered the following month. The price at the company was over 54,000 yuan, while the shop wanted over 70,000 yuan. However, they could provide two Sharp brand color TVs at the same price. A middle-aged man in the shop said, "As long as we can make a gross profit of 5,000 yuan, we can provide one imported color TV at the same price." The manager of Mao Xing Hardware and Electrical Appliances Shop said that since 1988, they had provided over 100 color TVs in this manner.

A knowledgeable person from the Changzhou Electrical and Mechanical Equipment Company told us, "These shops do not need much working capital or warehouses; they only need a storefront. Procurement agents give them checks, and they use the shop's checks to obtain delivery notes from our company. The goods are then picked up directly from our company's warehouse by the purchasing party. This is the advantage of these electrical and mechanical shops being located next to our company—it's truly a case of making a fortune with little to no capital!"

Additionally, some shops slightly repair and repaint discarded electrical and mechanical products, selling them as new. Procurement agents can request any brand, and the shops will simply stick the corresponding brand label on them, making it difficult to distinguish between genuine and counterfeit items.

Although the above situations are only part of what we have discovered, the mystery has been solved: converting public assets into private gains, shops and procurement agents sharing the profits—this is the secret to the prosperity of these shops and some procurement agents!

　　常州博爱路空前繁荣的背后
    常州机电设备公司所在的博爱路，近几年来空前繁荣。短短５００多米的一条街，竟有３９家机电产品商店，人称“机电一条街”。在这条街上，许多个体户领了集体执照，他们的机电产品的价格，一般比常州机电设备公司高出许多。然而，光顾这些商店的却大有人在。为了揭开谜底，日前我们进行了一次“实地侦察”。
    我们先来到丽达经营部，提出要进３种型号的轴承２３００套。这家商店的售价比常州机电设备公司高３５２０元，但他们答应给我们３％的回扣。这家经营部一个姓姚的还说：“每套轴承可以加价３角钱，这笔钱直接以现金付给你们。”这使我们大为惊讶，如果我们真是供销员，不费吹灰之力，就可拿到好处费１６６８元。随后，我们又来茂兴五金交电商店，提出要进上海产的１２０千瓦柴油发电机组，商店无现货，但他们立即与常州机电设备公司联系，说下个月就可以交货。这台发电机组，常州机电设备公司的价格为５４０００多元，而这家商店却要７００００多元，不过可以平价供给２台夏普牌彩色电视机。店里一个中年男子说：“我们只要毛利能赚到５０００元，就可以平价供给一台进口彩电。”茂兴五金交电商店负责人说，１９８８年以来他们已搭供彩电１００多台。
    常州机电设备公司一位知情人告诉我们：“这些商店不需要多少流动资金，也不需要仓库，只需一个门面。供销员把支票给他们，他们用商店的支票到我公司开出货票，货物由购货方直接到我公司仓库提取。这就是他们这些机电商店开在我们公司旁边的好处，真可谓一本万利或无本万利！”
    此外，有些商店还把报废的机电产品稍加修理、油漆一下，当作正品出售，供销员要什么牌号，他们便贴上那个牌号的商标，让你真假难辨。
    尽管上述情况只是我们了解到的一部分，但谜底已经揭开：化公为私，商店与供销员互相分“肥”，这就是这些商店和一些单位供销员发财的诀窍！
