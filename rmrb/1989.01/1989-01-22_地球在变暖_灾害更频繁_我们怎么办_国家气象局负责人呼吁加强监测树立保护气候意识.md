The Earth is Warming, Disasters Becoming More Frequent - What Should We Do?
The Head of the National Meteorological Administration Calls for Strengthened Monitoring and the Establishment of Climate Protection Awareness

BEIJING — Over the past year, the international media has frequently reported and discussed the global warming issue caused by the greenhouse effect. Various international organizations and academic groups have held multiple international conferences on this topic. The U.S. Senate held a special hearing on the matter. Leaders and decision-makers from countries such as Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom have also expressed their concerns and worries. Why is this the case? Recently, reporter Xie Lianhui interviewed Luo Jibin, Deputy Director of the National Meteorological Administration.

Luo Jibin explained that due to the significant increase in fossil fuel consumption by various countries, the amount of carbon dioxide and other waste gases released into the atmosphere has increased. Meanwhile, forests that absorb carbon dioxide have been extensively deforested, leading to an increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere. Solar shortwave radiation penetrates the atmosphere and heats the Earth's surface, but the longwave thermal radiation emitted by the heated surface is absorbed by carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere, causing the atmosphere to warm up. This is the greenhouse effect and the resulting climate warming. If left unchecked, by the 1930s, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will double compared to pre-industrial levels, and the global average annual temperature will rise by 1.5°C to 4.5°C.

Luo Jibin said that normally, a temperature change of one or two degrees does not seem significant, and a change of three to five degrees is also not a major concern. However, a rise in the global average annual temperature is a different matter. In the next 40 to 50 years, the average temperature is expected to rise by 1.5°C to 4.5°C. This rate and extent of warming are significant and could bring about a series of consequences for human society.

Firstly, the warming of seawater and its expansion will cause sea levels to rise by 20 to 140 centimeters compared to current levels. Coastal cities and islands will face more severe typhoons, storm surges, and heavy rainfall. Some cities that are currently gradually sinking will face even bigger problems. Secondly, the frequency of droughts and floods may increase. In some mid-latitude regions and cities, summer rainfall may decrease, leading to high evaporation rates and unbearable heat. Inland lakes and reservoirs may see their water levels drop or even dry up, increasing the risk of forest and grassland fires. Conversely, some low-lying areas in high latitudes may experience frequent waterlogging. For agriculture, there are both benefits and drawbacks, but the drawbacks outweigh the benefits. The benefits include extended growing seasons in high-latitude regions, increased rainfall in some arid and semi-arid areas, and the promotion of crop growth due to increased carbon dioxide in the air. The drawbacks include changes in the current climate patterns that favor crop growth, which will be detrimental to winter crops and increase the risk of pests and diseases.

Luo Jibin continued, mentioning that in addition to carbon dioxide, other greenhouse gases include methane, nitrous oxide, and chlorofluorocarbons. He particularly noted chlorofluorocarbons. This gas not only absorbs thermal radiation from the Earth's surface, causing the atmosphere to warm, but also damages the ozone layer in the atmosphere, leading to reduced agricultural yields and decreased fish and seafood production.

He concluded by saying that global warming and environmental issues are problems caused by humans, and thus, humans should address them. This effort cannot be achieved by a few countries alone; it requires greater international consensus and cooperation.

Luo Jibin appealed that the issue of climate warming is also crucial for China's long-term economic development and should be given widespread attention. On one hand, meteorological departments need to strengthen climate monitoring and research on climate change. On the other hand, it is essential to foster a climate protection awareness and mindset among the general public.

　　地球在变暖　灾害更频繁　我们怎么办    
    国家气象局负责人呼吁加强监测树立保护气候意识
    本报讯  记者谢联辉报道：近一年来，国外舆论界频频报道、讨论温室效应引起的全球性气候变暖问题，一些国际组织和学术团体以此为主题多次组织国际会议。美国参议院举行过专门听证会。加拿大、澳大利亚、英国等政府首脑和决策者也纷纷表示关切和忧虑。这是为什么？最近，记者就此访问了国家气象局副局长骆继宾。
    骆继宾介绍说，由于各国石化燃料大量增加，排放到大气中的二氧化碳等废气增多，而吸收二氧化碳的森林被大量砍伐，导致大气中二氧化碳等含量增多。太阳短波辐射透过大气层射入地面，地面增暖后放出的长波热辐射却被大气中的二氧化碳等气体吸收，使大气增暖，这就是温室效应及其引起气候变暖的原因。若任其发展，到下世纪３０年代，大气中的二氧化碳含量将比世界工业化之前增长一倍，全球年平均气温将比现在升高１．５℃—４．５℃。
    骆继宾说，平时气温变化一二度大家感觉不出来，变化三五度也不在乎，可全球的年平均气温升高，却是另一个概念。在今后的四五十年中，年平均气温要升高１．５—４．５℃，这种变暖的速度和程度都是可观的，可能会给人类社会带来一系列后果。
    首先是海水变暖、膨胀，海平面将比现在上升２０—１４０厘米，沿海城市和岛屿遇到的台风、风暴潮、暴雨等灾害会更严重。有些城市目前还在逐步下沉，问题就会更大。其次是旱涝次数可能会增多。中纬度有些地区、城市夏季少雨，蒸发量大，会变得酷热难忍。内陆湖泊、水库水位将下降甚至干涸，森林和草原失火会增多。而高纬度有些低地，则可能经常渍涝。对于农业来说，有利也有弊，但弊大于利。有利的是高纬度地区生长季节延长，有些干旱、半干旱地区降雨增多，空气中二氧化碳增多能促进作物生长；不利的是现在多数地区有利于作物生长的雨热同季气候将改变，不仅对越冬作物不利，还会造成病虫害。
    骆继宾接着说，除了二氧化碳，温室气体还有甲烷、笑气、氟氯碳化合物等。他特别提到氟氯碳化合物。这种气体不仅吸收地面的热辐射使大气增温，还能破坏大气中的臭氧层，造成农业减产、鱼类和水产品产量下降。
    他最后说，全球气候变暖和环境问题一样，既然是人类自身造成的，人类自身就应该治理它。这种治理当然不是靠少数几个国家，必须有更多的国际共识和合作。
    骆继宾呼吁，气候变暖问题也对我国长远经济发展关系重大，需要引起广泛重视。一方面，气象部门要加强气候的监测和对气候变化的研究，另一方面，要在全体人民中树立保护气候的意识和观念。
