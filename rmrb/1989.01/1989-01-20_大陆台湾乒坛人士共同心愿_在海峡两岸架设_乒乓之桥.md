A few days ago, the news that the Chinese Taipei Table Tennis Association invited mainland table tennis players to visit Taiwan attracted attention. Can table tennis build a bridge for sports exchanges across the Taiwan Strait? Tonight, the reporter interviewed Li Fuhong, Xu Shaofa, and other table tennis enthusiasts who had just returned from the Asia-Europe Ping-Pong Challenge in Beijing.

Li Fuhong said that developing sports exchanges across the Taiwan Strait is a common wish of us and our friends in the sports community in Taiwan. Mainland table tennis players are very willing to contribute to building a "ping-pong bridge." However, it is difficult to say when a real breakthrough can be achieved. Li Fuhong said that among the people named by the Taipei Table Tennis Association, except for Teng Yi and a few others, the rest are all Communist Party members. He could not predict whether the Taiwanese authorities would approve the Taipei Table Tennis Association's invitation to mainland players. He emphasized that the invitation should not have any additional conditions.

When talking about the Asian Cup Table Tennis Tournament to be held in the mainland in May, Li Fuhong said that he would, according to the relevant regulations of international sports organizations, invite the Taipei Table Tennis Association. He eagerly looks forward to meeting with his Taiwanese table tennis colleagues in Beijing.

Coach Xu Shaofa said that through this Asia-Europe Ping-Pong Challenge, it is even more evident that the Chinese men's table tennis team is currently facing a very severe situation. There are excellent players from Sweden and other European countries blocking the way, and there are also strong challenges from South Korean and other Asian teams, making it a situation of being attacked from both sides. He believes that the South Korean team has been very strong recently, and the emergence of new star Kim Jae-hyeok poses a greater threat to the Chinese team than the Swedish team.

It is reported that the Chinese table tennis team will go to the Huangshi base in Hubei after the Spring Festival for a month of intensive training aimed at the 40th World Table Tennis Championships.

　　大陆台湾乒坛人士共同心愿
    在海峡两岸架设“乒乓之桥”
    本报北京１月１９日讯  记者刘小明报道：几天前中国台北乒协邀请大陆乒乓好手访台的消息引起人们的关注。乒乓球能够为海峡两岸的体育交往架起一座桥吗？今晚，记者采访了刚参加完亚欧对抗赛返京的李富荣、许绍发等乒坛人士。
    李富荣表示，发展海峡两岸的体育交流是我们和台湾体育界朋友的共同心愿，大陆乒乓球运动员很乐于为架设“乒乓之桥”尽力。不过究竟何时能真正实现突破还很难讲。李富荣说，台北乒协点名邀请的人中，除滕毅等二人外其余都是共产党员。他无法预计台湾当局能否批准台北乒协对大陆选手的邀请。他强调邀请不应附加其它条件。
    当谈到今年５月前后在大陆举行的亚洲杯乒乓球赛时，李富荣表示将按照有关国际体育组织的规定向台北乒协发出邀请，他热切期待在北京与台湾乒乓球同行相聚。
    许绍发教练说，通过这次亚欧对抗赛更使人感到，中国乒乓球男队当前面临着十分严峻的形势，既有以瑞典为首的一批欧洲优秀选手的阻击，又有南朝鲜队等亚洲劲旅越来越强硬的挑战，可谓腹背受敌。他认为南朝鲜队近来气势很盛，又冒出金泽洙这一新秀，对中国队的威胁甚至超过瑞典队。
    据悉，中国乒乓球队将于春节后赴湖北黄石基地，进行针对第４０届世乒赛的一个月集训。
