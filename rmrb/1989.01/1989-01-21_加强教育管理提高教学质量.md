Edition: 5

Your newspaper published a letter from a reader titled "Please Think About Our Students" on the fifth page of the December 14th edition last year. After investigation, we found that the issues raised in the letter are generally accurate.

We believe that the problems mentioned in the students' letter, such as insufficient teaching staff and poor management, also exist in some other schools in our county. We have decided to take immediate action to address these issues, formulate measures, strengthen teaching management and teacher team building, and strive to improve the quality of education.

　　加强教育管理提高教学质量
    你报去年１２月１４日第五版刊登了《请为我们学生想想》的读者来信。经了解，来信反映的情况基本属实。
    我们认为，学生信中反映的学校师资不足、管理不善的问题，在我县其它一些学校也存在。我们决定：立即着手解决这类问题，制定措施，加强教学管理和师资队伍建设，努力提高教育质量。
