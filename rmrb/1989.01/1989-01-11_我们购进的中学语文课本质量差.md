Title: The Quality of Our Purchased Middle School Language Textbooks is Poor

The middle school language textbooks used in our city in 1988 have poor printing quality. Not only are many pages unevenly inked, with some characters appearing as double dashed lines, and pages improperly bound, but there are also errors such as misspelled words, incorrect pinyin, and inaccurate punctuation in some lessons.

Take, for example, the junior middle school language textbook, fifth volume, purchased by our school: On pages 177 to 180, 80% of the printed characters are double dashed lines; on page 107, the last line, the first character "还" is printed as "不"; on page 154, the last line, there is an extra comma; on page 114, the first line is the beginning of a paragraph, which should be indented by two spaces, but it is not; on page 234, the ninth line, the first punctuation mark is incorrect.

Language textbooks should be a model for students learning the national language. However, textbooks of this quality cause many inconveniences for students' learning and teachers' teaching.

### 我们购进的中学语文课本质量差

　　我们购进的中学语文课本质量差
    我市１９８８年使用的中学语文课本印刷质量太差，不但许多版面油墨不均匀、有的字为双虚线、装订页面不正，而且有些课文中出现错字、拼音不对、标点不准确等现象。
    仅以我校购进的初中语文第五册为例：第１７７页至第１８０页中，有８０％的课本印字为双虚线；第１０７页最末一行第一个字“还”印成了“不”；第１５４页最末一行最后一个逗号是多余的；第１１４页头一行是一个自然段的开头，应空两格，但未空；第２３４页第９行第一个标点是错的。
    语文课本应是学生学习祖国语言的典范，但这样的课本，给学生学习和教师教学带来诸多不便。
