　　南非开始从纳撤军
    新华社哈博罗内１月２８日电  据来自比勒陀利亚的消息，南非陆军司令詹尼·赫尔登伊斯昨天在比勒陀利亚向新闻界宣布，南非已经开始从纳米比亚撤出它的军队和装备。
    但是，他没有透露首批撤军的人数。
    赫尔登伊斯说，南非将严格履行联合国安理会关于纳米比亚独立的４３５号决议的条款。
    他说，南非最后一批军队的撤离工作将在纳米比亚选举日期确定之后的一周内完成。
    关于南非在纳米比亚驻军的人数，目前，说法不一，估计约为８０００至１０万人。
    去年１２月２２日，安哥拉、古巴和南非在纽约签署了关于实现西南部非洲和平的三方协议。协议规定，今年４月１日起开始执行联合国安理会关于纳米比亚独立的４３５号决议。
