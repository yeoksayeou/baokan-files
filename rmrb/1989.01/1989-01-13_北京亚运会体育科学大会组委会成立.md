The 1990 Beijing Asian Games Sports Science Conference, themed "Sports Science and the Future," is scheduled to be held from September 16 to 20 next year. The organizing committee and academic committee for this conference were officially established in Beijing today. Zhang Caizhen, Vice Chairman of the State Sports Commission, will serve as the chairman of the organizing committee. Professor Qu Mianyu, an expert in sports medicine from Beijing Medical University, will serve as the chairman of the academic committee.

According to the tradition of the International Olympic Committee, a sports science conference is held in the host country during every world comprehensive sports event. At last year's Olympic Science Conference in Seoul, Zhang Caizhen, on behalf of the Chinese Olympic Committee, extended an invitation to sports science experts and renowned scholars from the 38 member countries of the Asian Olympic Council, including China Taipei and Palestine, to participate in the 1990 Beijing Asian Games Sports Science Conference.

The organizing committee's leader stated that during the conference, 500 scholars from various Asian countries and 20 world authorities in sports science will be invited to exchange and discuss topics in sports theory, sports philosophy, sports management, school sports, and other disciplines.

The State Science and Technology Commission attaches great importance to the Beijing Asian Games Sports Science Conference, allocating 300,000 yuan in funding and appointing Deng Nan as the vice chairman of the organizing committee.

　　北京亚运会体育科学大会组委会成立
    本报北京１月１２日讯  记者李北大报道：主题为“体育科学与未来”的１９９０年北京亚运会科学大会定于明年９月１６日至２０日举行。本届大会组委会和学术委员会今天在京宣告成立。组委会主任由国家体委副主任张彩珍担任。北京医科大学运动医学专家曲绵域出任学委会主任。
    按国际奥委会惯例，每逢世界综合性运动会，都要同时在运动会举办国召开体育科学大会。去年在汉城奥林匹克科学大会上，张彩珍曾代表中国奥委会向包括中国台北和巴勒斯坦在内的亚奥理事会３８个成员的体育科学专家和世界著名学者发出邀请，欢迎他们参加１９９０年北京亚运会科学大会。
    组委会负责人说，大会期间将邀请５００名亚洲各国的学者以及２０名世界体育科学权威人士，就体育理论、体育哲学、体育管理学、学校体育等学科展开交流和探讨。
    国家科委对北京亚运会科学大会十分重视，拨款３０万元，并派邓楠担任组委会副主任。
