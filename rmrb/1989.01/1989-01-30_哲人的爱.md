Title: The Philosopher's Love

Several years ago, I read a piece of news: Professor Shen Fupeng of Qingdao Medical College passed away in February 1982 due to illness. Before his death, he devoted all his energy to teaching, and left instructions to donate his body to medical education after death. His internal organs were used for partial dissection teaching, and his skeleton was made into specimens for teaching purposes, allowing his body to "stand guard again." This news greatly shocked me, and I closed the book to reflect, my thoughts drifting to the shores of the Bohai Sea. The spirit of self-sacrifice of a thorough materialist and a philosopher's selfless love for the group were all implied in this.

Following Professor Shen Fupeng, Professor Hu Fukuo, the former president of Beijing Medical University, also voluntarily donated his body to the school as a skeletal specimen before his death. The deeds of these two medical professors shone in succession. As far as I know, there are quite a few cases of people donating kidneys, corneas, or even their entire bodies in their wills, either to benefit others or to benefit the public. However, I rarely hear of cases where people specify in their wills to have their bodies made into skeletal specimens for teaching purposes. From such examples, one can get a glimpse of how strong the will and noble the style of China's advanced intellectuals are in sacrificing themselves for the group and dedicating themselves to the country.

At the end of 1987, I suddenly received a letter from Qingdao Medical College. It was sent by the staff of the president's office. Inside the envelope, in addition to the letter, there was also a picture of a human skeleton, which was the skeletal specimen left by Professor Shen. The letter said: "After his death, his students made his skeleton into a skeleton and placed it in the specimen room of the Anatomy Teaching and Research Office of Qingdao Medical College (with a glass cover). Everyone who passes by this room pays their respects to the skeleton with great reverence." At the end of the letter, it said: "Mr. Qin... could you write a few words for our college's Professor Shen? If you are kind enough to grant this, we will engrave it on the glass cover..."

I looked at the picture of the skeleton, and my thoughts were in turmoil. This skull did not give me fear or sorrow, but rather warmth and encouragement. I placed the picture under the glass plate of my desk, and I often looked at it a few times during my morning and evening work. I felt that it had a purifying effect on my soul, just like alum can purify water. Under the glass plate of my desk, there were no photos of glamorous stars or beautiful idols, but only this picture of a skull. This is not because I am already an old man; even if I were a young man in the prime of my life, I would still do the same. Facing this picture, feelings of reverence and affection drove away all trivial thoughts.

This picture of the skeleton seemed to give me a silent command, and I decided to write the few dozen words that would be engraved on the glass cover.

Usually, I do not draft when writing small articles. However, for writing these few dozen words, I decided to take a long walk on a quiet street at night to think and ponder. I remembered a similar saying by a literary giant: "When you dip your pen into the inkwell, if it is not dipped in your own blood, then do not write."

That night, the moonlight was soft, and the lemon eucalyptus trees stood tall and pure. The moonlight filtered through the phoenix trees, casting a patchwork of light on the ground. The long street was quiet, with no passersby. I paced back and forth, once, twice, and again. The skull appeared before my eyes, and my imagination restored it to a body of flesh and blood: he bent over his books under the lamp, he stood firm on the podium lecturing, he gazed deeply at the crowd, and resolutely wrote the will to donate his bones. The scene was vivid in my mind. Although I am not a believer, I felt a believer-like sentiment, yearning for an opportunity to converse with a sacred soul.

I knew that this professor had once suffered political injustice, but "the storm cannot break the eagle's wings." "The heretic treats me, and I, a worthy man, repay him."

Some people, even after death, build mausoleums and pyramids, add inner and outer coffins to their coffins, and cover their graves with magnificent buildings. The dead seem to prop open the coffin lid, stretch out their hands, and shout: "Give me more things!" Some people, on their deathbed, struggle to say: "I want to make another contribution!" The distance between the plunderer and the contributor is so vast!

That night, I lingered on the street for a long time. When I returned home, I faced the picture of the skeleton, spread out the paper, and wrote one draft and tore it up, then wrote another. Finally, I exerted my strength and wrote the following few dozen words for the "Dedication":

	He instructed before his death to donate his remains,
	Specifying the skeletal specimen to be displayed here.
	The glass cabinet is his special tomb,
	Outside the glass cover is his vast love!
	A will straight as a thunderbolt in spring,
	A wish to see the spirit of a philosopher.
	Let us walk lightly into the hall,
	Stand silently before the monument and pay our respects!

　　哲人的爱
    秦牧
    好几年前，我读过一则消息：青岛医学院教授沈福彭，１９８２年２月因病去世，他生前殚精竭虑，尽瘁教学，亲嘱死后将遗体献给医学教育事业，五脏作局部解剖教学用，骨骼制成标本，供示教用，用遗体“再站一班岗”。这则消息使我大受震撼，掩卷沉思，神驰渤海之滨。一个彻底唯物主义者的献身精神，一个哲人对群体无私的爱，尽在不言之中了。
    继沈福彭教授之后，北京医科大学前任校长胡傅揆教授也在生前自愿地把遗体献给学校作为骨骼标本。这两位医学教授的事迹先后辉映。据我所知，遗嘱捐赠肾脏、眼球，以至于躯体，或以利他人，或造福群众的事虽有不少，但是遗嘱指定把自己的遗体制作骨骼标本供教学用的事我极少听到。中国先进的知识分子对于舍己为群，献身祖国具有怎样坚强的意志和崇高的风格，从这样的事例中也可以想见一二了。
    １９８７年底，我突然接到青岛医学院一封来信，那是院长办公室的工作人员寄来的。里面除了信件外，还有一张人体骨骼图片，那就是沈教授遗留下来的骨骼标本了。信里有这样的话：“他去世后，由他的学生将骨骼制成骨架，陈放在青岛医学院解剖学教研室的标本室里（外有玻璃罩），人们每过此室，都以十分崇敬的心情，瞻仰骨架。”信末这样说：“秦老……你能否为我院沈教授写几句话，如蒙赐字，我们将把它刻在玻璃罩上……”
    我端详着那张骨架图片，百感纷纭。这具髑髅给予我的不是忧惧、哀伤，而是亲切、鼓舞。我把图片放在写字台的玻璃板下，早晚工作时经常瞧它几眼，我觉得它对我的灵魂，有净化的作用，犹如明矾之可以净水一样。我的写字台的玻璃板下，没有任何绮年玉貌，皓齿明眸的明星歌星的照片，却有这么一张髑髅的照片。这并不是因为我已经是老头子了，即使我是个风华正茂的青年人，我也会这样。面对这张照片，崇敬、可亲的感情驱除了一切渺不足道的杂念。
    这副骨架图片仿佛给了我一道无声的命令，我决意写那将被刻在玻璃罩上的几十个字。
    平素写些小文章我是不起草稿的。但是为了写这几十个字，我却决定夜里到附近僻静的街道上长时间漫步，思索、酝酿。我想起了一位文豪类似这样意思的话：“当你把笔插进墨水瓶里的时候，如果不是蘸着自己的血来写的话，那就不要动笔。”
    那夜月色溶溶，柠檬桉雪白的树干显得十分高洁。月光透过凤凰木，洒落了一地斑驳的光点。长街寂寂，阒无行人，我来回踱步，一次、一次又一次。那具骷髅在我眼前冉冉腾起，我的想象使它还原为血肉之躯：他埋头在灯下研读，他屹立在讲坛上讲学，他以深邃的眼光凝视人群，毅然写下献出骨骼遗嘱的情景历历如在目前。我虽不是教徒，却涌起一种教徒似的心情，渴望能够有个和神圣的魂魄对话的机会。
    我知道这位教授生前曾经受过政治上不公正的待遇，然而，“风暴压不断雄鹰的翅膀。”“异端待我，国士报之。”
    有人死了，还要造地宫，造金字塔，棺上要加内椁外椁，坟上还要盖巍峨建筑，死者仿佛撑开了棺盖，伸出手来喊道：“再给我东西！”有人死时，临终还拚尽气力，讲出这么一句话：“我想再奉献！”掠夺者和奉献者之间的距离，该是多么遥远！
    那夜我在街上盘桓了很久，回家后对着骨架图片，铺开稿纸，写了一张又撕了一张，最后，拚却我的心力，终于写出了这么几十个字的《献辞》：
    他生前叮嘱献出遗骸，
    指定骨架标本在这儿陈摆。
    玻璃橱里是他特殊的坟，
    玻璃罩外是他浩瀚的爱！
    一纸遗嘱直如震世春雷，
    一宗心愿想见哲人气概。
    让我们脚步轻轻走进大厅，
    伫立丰碑之前默默礼拜！
