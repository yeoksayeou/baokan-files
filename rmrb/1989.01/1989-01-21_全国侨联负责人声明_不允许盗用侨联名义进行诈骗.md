National Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese Vice Chairman Huang Junjun today stated that various levels of Overseas Chinese Federation organizations must cooperate with the Industrial and Commercial Administrative Management departments and other relevant departments to expose and shut down companies that use the names "Overseas Chinese Federation" or "Overseas Chinese" for fraudulent economic activities.

Huang Junjun said that in the past two years, there have been frequent instances of so-called enterprises and companies using the name "Chinese Overseas Chinese Federation" engaging in economic activities. They claim to have large sums of money overseas and can provide long-term low-interest or interest-free loans to domestic enterprises and institutions, thereby defrauding some units and damaging the reputation of the National Overseas Chinese Federation and local Overseas Chinese Federation organizations. Recently, the State Industrial and Commercial Administrative Management Bureau shut down 29 illegal economic organizations, including companies, groups, and banks using the names "Chinese Overseas Chinese Federation" or "Chinese International Overseas Chinese Federation," which have no relation to the National Overseas Chinese Federation. Shutting them down actually protects the reputation of the Overseas Chinese Federation.

Huang Junjun introduced that since the reform and opening up, the work of various levels of Overseas Chinese Federation has gradually shifted to serving economic construction. According to incomplete statistics, in the past 10 years, various levels of Overseas Chinese Federation and returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese have directly participated in introducing over $4 billion in foreign capital, supporting the establishment of over 35,000 enterprises, and establishing over 1,000 enterprises on their own. From the reports of various places, Overseas Chinese Federation self-operated enterprises are all legally operated.

Huang Junjun pointed out that the enterprises and institutions currently operated by the National Overseas Chinese Federation include Huilian Company, Beijing Overseas Chinese Building Limited Company, and the Chinese Overseas Chinese Economic and Technological Consulting Center and the Chinese Overseas Chinese Publishing Company. All directly affiliated enterprises of the National Overseas Chinese Federation have been approved and registered by the relevant departments and are protected by law.

　　全国侨联负责人声明    
    不允许盗用侨联名义进行诈骗
    新华社北京１月２０日电（记者孙勇）全国侨联副主席黄军军今天说，对盗用“侨联”、“华侨”名义进行行骗等非法经济活动的公司，各级侨联组织要配合工商行政管理等有关部门予以揭露和取缔。
    黄军军说，近两年来，经常有冠以“中国侨联”名称的所谓企业集团、公司，到处进行经济活动。他们自称在国外有巨额资金，可向国内企事业提供长期低息或无息贷款等进行诈骗，使一些单位蒙受损失，损害了全国侨联和地方侨联组织的声誉。日前国家工商行政管理局取缔的２９家非法经济组织中冠以“中国侨联”或“中国国际侨联”名称的公司、集团、银行等，与全国侨联没有任何关系，取缔它们实际上也维护了侨联的声誉。
    黄军军介绍说，改革、开放以来，各级侨联的工作中心逐步转到了为经济建设服务上。据不完全统计，１０年来，各级侨联及归侨、侨眷直接参与引进的国外资金有４０多亿美元，扶持办的企业３．５万多家，自办企业１０００多家。从各地汇报的情况看，侨联自办企业都是守法经营的。
    黄军军指出，全国侨联现在所办的企事业有华联公司、北京华侨大厦有限公司以及中国华侨经济技术咨询中心和中国华侨出版公司。全国侨联所办的直属企业都经过有关部门批准和注册，是受法律保护的。
