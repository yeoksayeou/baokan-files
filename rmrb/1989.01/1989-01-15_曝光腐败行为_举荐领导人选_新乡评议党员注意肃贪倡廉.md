The New Xiang Municipal Committee has been actively promoting democratic evaluation of party members in its direct-affiliated departments. Since last year, 19,711 party members from municipal departments have participated in the democratic evaluation. Among them, 1,258 were rated as outstanding party members, 105 as basically unqualified, 16 as unqualified, and 16 as having disciplinary violations. Appropriate measures have been taken to address the unqualified party members.

The democratic evaluation of party members in New Xiang began in February last year. The Municipal Committee has focused on clean governance as a key area for departmental evaluations and has been strengthening the department's anti-corruption efforts. The Municipal Committee has guided departmental party organizations and party members to connect with their own realities, thoroughly cleanse their thoughts, rectify discipline, and enhance their awareness of maintaining integrity. Over the past 10 months, party members have collectively refused bribes totaling 52,820 yuan and returned 374 public items.

The democratic evaluation of party members has also exposed some deeply hidden disciplinary issues. A party member in a certain department, unable to resist the temptation of money, privately arranged urban household registrations for others and accepted 5,000 yuan in bribes. During the democratic evaluation, this was exposed and verified by the masses, leading to his expulsion from the party. The Municipal Bureau of Materials had loopholes in controlling the purchase of cars by social groups, which were pointed out by the masses during the democratic evaluation. The bureau's party committee conducted a thorough investigation and immediately implemented measures to plug the loopholes, publicly auctioning off 9 high-end sedans that were recovered. To correct the improper practices in personnel matters, the Municipal Committee also, based on public opinions, adopted a method of open nomination, qualification review, examination and defense, and organizational assessment to publicly select 10 candidates for deputy county and district leaders across the city.

During the democratic evaluation, the New Xiang Municipal Committee emphasized that departments and leading cadres should play both organizational leadership and exemplary roles. They should adhere to the principles of democracy, equality, and openness, and conduct thorough self-examinations and summaries in terms of ideology, work, style, and discipline. They should sincerely accept the organization's assessment and the party members' and masses' evaluations. Municipal Committee Secretary Kong Maoshan and other standing committee members all participated in the democratic evaluation of their respective branches. The Municipal Committee's standing committee and various bureau party groups also broadly listened to the criticisms and suggestions from party members and non-party members within their subordinate units.

According to statistics, 684 county-level and above cadres participated in the democratic evaluation of party members, including 36 at the municipal level and 648 at the county and bureau levels. Through the democratic evaluation, the stagnant state of party life has been improved, and many party members and cadres have both seriously evaluated others and strictly evaluated themselves, enhancing the ability of departmental party organizations to resolve their own contradictions.

　　曝光腐败行为　举荐领导人选
    新乡评议党员注意肃贪倡廉
    本报讯  河南新乡市委重视抓好直属机关民主评议党员活动。去年以来，市直机关有１９７１１名党员参加民主评议，评出优秀党员１２５８人；基本不合格党员１０５人；不合格党员１６人；违纪党员１６人，并对不合格党员分别进行了处置。
    新乡市开展民主评议党员活动是从去年２月开始的。市委把为政清廉作为机关评议的重点，认真加强机关的廉政建设。市委引导机关各级党组织和党员联系本单位和自身的实际，认真清理思想，整顿纪律，增强保持廉洁的自觉性。１０个月来，党员共拒贿５２８２０元；退还公物３７４件。
    民主评议党员，使一些违纪隐蔽较深的问题也被揭露出来。某单位一党员经不住金钱的诱惑，为别人私办城市户口，受贿５０００元，民主评议中被群众检举揭发查证属实后，将其清除出党。市物资局在控制社会集团购买汽车中有漏洞，群众在民主评议中反映出来以后，局党委认真进行检查，并立即制定措施，堵塞漏洞，将追回的９部高级小轿车公开拍卖。为了纠正用人问题上的不正之风，市委还根据群众意见，采取公开报名，资格审查，考试答辩，组织考核的方式，在全市范围内公开选拔了１０个副县区长人选。
    在民主评议中，新乡市委强调机关和领导干部既要发挥组织领导作用，又要发挥表率作用，坚持民主、平等、公开的原则，从思想、工作、作风、纪律等方面，进行认真的自我检查和总结，诚恳接受组织的考核和党员群众的评议。市委书记孔茂山等常委一班人，都参加了本支部的民主评议。市委常委和各局党组还广泛听取了下属单位党内外群众的批评和建议。
    据统计，县、处以上干部参加民主评议党员共６８４人。其中市级３６人；县处级６４８人。通过民主评议，党内生活沉闷的状况有所改变，不少党员和干部既严肃评别人，又严格评自己，增强了机关党组织解决自身矛盾的能力。 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（赵金德　刘贵生　卢振远）
