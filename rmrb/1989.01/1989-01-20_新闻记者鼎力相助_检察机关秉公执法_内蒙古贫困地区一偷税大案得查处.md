A major tax evasion case involving 159,246.66 yuan, which was reported by the public and assisted by journalists, has recently been investigated and resolved in the Victory Township Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Hangjin Banner, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

On December 15, 1987, reporter Zhao Yongfeng from the Yikezhao People's Radio Station of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region visited the Victory Township Supply and Marketing Cooperative. Upon seeing the reporter, worker Lian Weimin immediately said, "It's all fake!" The reporter delved into the matter and learned from Lian Weimin that the cooperative's director, Zhao Yufa, had evaded a large amount of state taxes from 1985 to 1987 through various means, such as off-the-books operations, forging documents to inflate costs, reducing profits, and issuing excessive bonuses and goods. The reporter immediately changed the focus of the interview and conducted a preliminary investigation into the situation, gathering a large amount of evidence.

Unexpectedly, when the reporter reported this situation truthfully to the higher-level auditing and other departments, these departments not only did not take action, but some individuals even fed back the reporter's report to the cooperative, alerting them. The cooperative then organized a three-day "clean-up" of their accounts. Afterwards, the cooperative's director, Zhao Yufa, retaliated by transferring Lian Weimin. Lian Weimin refused this unjustified transfer, so Zhao Yufa simply stopped his work and stopped paying his salary. Lian Weimin traveled hundreds of miles to find reporter Zhao Yongfeng again, seeking help. The reporter then stepped forward and submitted a complaint to the Yikezhao Alliance People's Procuratorate. After the procuratorate accepted the case, the reporter provided the procuratorate with a large amount of the latest investigation materials. It was finally determined that Zhao Yufa had evaded various state taxes totaling 159,246.66 yuan from 1985 to 1987, constituting the crime of tax evasion.

On December 14, 1988, considering that Zhao Yufa's attitude towards admitting guilt was relatively good and that he had fully paid back the taxes, the procuratorate decided not to prosecute Zhao Yufa; relevant departments removed him from his position as director and gave him a one-year probationary period within the party. For Lian Weimin, who reported the truth to the reporter and actively exposed the case, relevant organizations decided to restore his work, pay back his salary, and give him a reward.

After the case was closed, a responsible person from the banner committee said: "From 1985 to 1987, the average annual fiscal revenue of our banner was only 360 million yuan, and the average annual subsidy from the state fiscal budget was 148.6 million yuan. However, in such a small enterprise with only 38 people, a tax evasion case of this magnitude occurred, which is indeed shocking."

　　新闻记者鼎力相助　检察机关秉公执法
    内蒙古贫困地区一偷税大案得查处
    本报讯  一起由群众检举、新闻记者鼎力相助告发的１５．９２万元偷税案，最近在内蒙古自治区杭锦旗胜利乡供销合作社查处结案。
    １９８７年１２月１５日，内蒙古自治区伊克昭人民广播电台记者赵咏峰慕名到胜利乡供销合作社采访，职工连伟民一见记者就说：“假的！假的！”记者盘根究底，从连伟民那里了解到该社主任赵玉发在１９８５年到１９８７年的三年内，采取资金帐外经营、伪造单据扩大成本、减少利润、滥发奖金实物等手段，偷逃国家巨额税款的事实。记者当即改变了采访意图，对所反映的情况进行初步查证，掌握了大量事实。
    出乎意料的是，当记者如实向上级审计等机关报告这一情况后，这些部门不但不予查处，个别人甚至把记者报告的内容全都反馈给了这个供销社，使他们有所警觉，组织人力在帐务上进行了长达三天的“大清理”。事后，供销社主任赵玉发竟采取报复手段，调离连伟民。连伟民拒绝这一无端调动，赵玉发就干脆停止了他的工作，停发了他的工资。连伟民百里迢迢地又找到记者赵咏峰，请求给予帮助。这位记者便挺身而出，向伊克昭盟人民检察院递交了指控状。检察机关受理此案后，记者又向检察机关提供大量最新调查材料，最后查明赵玉发在１９８５年当选为该社主任后，三年偷逃国家各种税款达１５９２４６．６６元，构成了偷税罪。
    １９８８年１２月１４日，检察机关鉴于赵玉发认罪态度较好，并如数补缴了税款，决定对赵玉发免予起诉；有关部门撤销了他的主任职务，并给予留党察看一年的处分。对向记者反映真情并积极举报的连伟民，有关组织决定恢复其工作、补发工资，并给予奖励。
    结案后，旗委负责人说：“１９８５到１９８７年的三年内，我旗年平均财政收入只有３６０万元，年平均吃国家财政补贴１４８６万元，而在仅有３８人的这么一个小企业竟然出现这样大的偷税案，确实令人怵目惊心。”
