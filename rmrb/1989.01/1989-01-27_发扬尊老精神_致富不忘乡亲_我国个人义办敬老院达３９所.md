People's Daily reports that personally established nursing homes are a new phenomenon that has emerged during China's reform and opening up. According to incomplete statistics, the number of personally established nursing homes in the country has increased from 19 in 12 provinces and municipalities to 39 in 14 provinces and municipalities.

Various levels of government and relevant departments have given active support to individuals establishing nursing homes. Beijing Municipal Vice Mayor He Luli, on behalf of the municipal government, visited the individual who established the Chaoyang District Cuigezhuang Township nursing home, farmer Liang Guoguang, and presented him with a replica of an ancient porcelain vase. Tianjin Municipality has formulated specific measures to encourage individuals to establish nursing homes, helping to solve issues such as land acquisition and building material supply. The civil affairs departments at various levels in Jiangxi Province have strengthened their guidance for individuals establishing nursing homes, frequently visiting them and helping to solve problems in a timely manner. The civil affairs department in Henan Province has actively helped individuals establish and improve management systems, enhancing service quality. During holiday visits, inspections, evaluations, disaster relief, and other aspects, they are treated the same as collectively run nursing homes.

The noble spirit of individuals establishing nursing homes and the support from leaders have promoted the development of mass welfare undertakings. The Beijing Liang Guoguang Nursing Home has actively improved the living conditions of the nursing home, installing heating in each room, and annually depositing 20,000 to 50,000 yuan for the elderly, establishing a personal nursing fund, gradually enhancing the nursing home's self-sustaining ability. Many good deeds of mass welfare have emerged, such as people voluntarily raising, donating, and supporting welfare undertakings. According to statistics from Henan Province, the entire province has 4,684,000 people donating 11,331,900 yuan to nursing homes, with 110 people donating over 10,000 yuan each. Wealthy farmers in Beijing, such as Qing Zhenjiang and professional household Liu Fa, have successively donated 230,000 yuan to nursing homes, renovated bathrooms, purchased solar water heaters, and improved the living conditions of the elderly.

　　发扬尊老精神　致富不忘乡亲    
    我国个人义办敬老院达３９所
    本报讯  个人义办敬老院，是我国改革开放中涌现出来的新生事物。据不完全统计，全国个人义办敬老院已由１２个省、市的１９所发展到１４个省、市的３９所。

    个人义办敬老院的高尚情操和领导的支持，促进了群众性办福利事业的发展。北京市梁国光敬老院积极改善敬老院居住条件，给每个居室安装了暖气，还每年为老人存款２—５万元，建立个人敬老基金，逐步增强敬老院的自我保障能力。各地涌现出许多群众义养、捐款、赞助办福利事业的好人好事。据河南省统计，全省有４６８．４万人为敬老院捐款１１３３．１９万元，其中捐款千元以上的就有１１０人。北京市的富裕农民庆振江、专业户刘发等人先后向敬老院捐款２．３万元，还为敬老院装修了浴室，购置了太阳能热水器，改善了老人们的生活条件。
