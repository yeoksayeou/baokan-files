	New Achievements in Gene Engineering Research at Beijing Agricultural University: Pig Growth Hormone Increases Lean Meat Production

	Reported by Jiang Jianke: Researchers from the Animal Biochemistry Department at Beijing Agricultural University have extracted approximately 0.5 grams of a special protein from the pituitary glands of 4,000 pigs. This protein was then injected into 8 ordinary pigs. As a result, these 8 pigs each produced an additional 3.5 to 6 kilograms of lean meat.

	This special protein is known as pig growth hormone, a type of protein hormone that promotes animal growth. However, the concentration of pig growth hormone in the pituitary gland is very low. Since 1984, Beijing Agricultural University has been researching the use of gene engineering to produce pig growth hormone. Over the past few years, with the support of the State Science and Technology Commission, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the research team has successfully obtained messenger RNA from pig pituitary glands, extracted the pig growth hormone gene, and inserted this gene into E. coli bacteria. By cultivating these bacteria, they have been able to produce large quantities of inexpensive pig growth hormone for practical applications.

	Tests have shown that the pig growth hormone produced through gene engineering has a similar growth-promoting effect to natural growth hormones. Consuming meat from pigs treated with this hormone has no adverse effects on humans. It can improve feed efficiency, increase lean meat yield, and reduce fat content.

　　北农大基因工程研究新收获
    猪生长激素催猪多产瘦肉
    本报讯  记者蒋建科报道：北京农业大学动物生物化学教研室的科研人员，从４０００头猪的垂体中提取了约０．５克特殊的蛋白质，然后注射给８头普通猪。最后，这８头猪平均每头多产瘦肉３．５至６公斤。
    这种特殊的蛋白质叫猪生长激素，是一种蛋白质激素，有促进动物生长的作用。可是，猪生长激素在垂体中含量甚微。从１９８４年开始，北京农业大学开始研究用基因工程制造猪生长激素。几年来，在国家科委、农业部、中国科学院的支持下，研究人员由猪垂体制得信使ＲＮＡ，然后得到了猪生长激素基因，将此基因输入大肠杆菌；再培养大肠杆菌，用细菌制造出大量廉价的猪生长激素，用于生产实践。
    经测定，用基因工程生产出的猪生长激素，与天然生长激素有相似的促进生长的作用，人食这种猪肉后无任何副作用。它能提高饲料报酬，增加瘦肉产率，降低脂肪产率。
