Title: A Kaleidoscope of "Microclimates" – A Review of the "French 20th Century Literature Series"
Author: Luo Jia
Date: 1989-01-11
Edition: 8

The Li River Publishing House has made a bold move by releasing the "French 20th Century Literature Series" before the end of 1986. The first batch consisted of seven books, followed by a second batch of seven more, all dedicated to readers who appreciate French literature. In France, various cultural awards are typically announced at the end of the year, and Christmas has the tradition of gift-giving. During this time, books often serve as elegant and memorable gifts. Among the first batch of books from "Li River," some have already won different literary awards. For example, Marguerite Duras' "The Lover" won the 1984 Goncourt Prize and became a bestseller, with print runs exceeding a million copies.

The series' publication statement emphasizes the systematic introduction of 20th-century French literature. From this, one can infer that the series aims to transcend the fragmented and uncoordinated translations of recent French works. It selects works from various tendencies, schools, and styles, aiming to create a "microclimate" for introducing French contemporary literature. The first batch of books includes: Henri de Montherlant's "The Dinner Under the Chestnut Tree," Albert Camus' "The Just," Marguerite Duras' "Hiroshima Mon Amour" and "The Lover," Marguerite Yourcenar's "Oriental Tales," Jean-Paul Sartre's "The Devil and the Good Lord," and Robert Merle's "Weekend at Zuydcoote." The selection focuses on mainstream literary works while also breaking away from certain constraints, including elegant and readable materials.

The editor-in-chief of the series is Liu Mingjiu, a scholar of French literature. Opening the books, one finds that 13 out of the 14 books have analytical prefaces written by Liu Mingjiu.

It is likely that the editor-in-chief believes that mere translation does not complete the introduction task. Prefaces are indeed necessary. For writers like Camus and Sartre, who are known for their intellectual prowess, one can read their works from cover to cover without fully grasping their ideological depth! The author has skimmed through the prefaces and believes that Liu Mingjiu's prefaces are beneficial for readers in understanding these foreign texts. Moreover, prefaces are not necessarily dull and boring. Consider this: "It was all in vain, her tenderness, her pity, her countless hints and inspirations, her loud, almost maddened calls, all in vain, they could not awaken the man's memory..." You might think this is the beginning of a work, but it is actually the preface to the translation of "The Long Farewell." We have writers, novelists, essayists, and critics, but we have not yet seen a corresponding category like the French "préfaceur" (preface writer). With the continuous publication of the "French 20th Century Literature Series," Liu Mingjiu's contributions as a "preface writer" will become more apparent.

The "French 20th Century Literature Series," as the name suggests, is a collection of translated works. The authors in the first and second batches include three Nobel Prize winners, multiple Goncourt Prize winners, three members of the French Academy, one representative of the New Novel movement, and two renowned contemporary French female writers, making the lineup formidable. However, the translators are also impressive. Some are emerging talents, while others are less known, but most are mid-career translators. The translation style is not just about being faithful, expressive, and elegant; it also aims to be vivid. Although it cannot be said that they have fully developed their personal styles, different characteristics are already evident, such as some being ornate and refined, others being smooth and fluent, some being bold and powerful, and others being elegant and delicate, but all are faithful to the original. It is known that this group of translators are key figures in teaching, translation, and editing. Some French writers love to write long sentences. Recently, the author saw a French-to-Chinese translated work where a single sentence had 65 characters without any punctuation. However, this series of translations has clear and smooth sentences, with no convoluted or confusing phrases. Why is this? A translator revealed to the author: There is an unwritten rule among most translators in the series that the longest sentence should not exceed 20 characters! Then I wondered, what if, for the sake of completeness and to fully express a complex idea, one has to exceed the specified number of characters? The answer was: Sentences exceeding 20 characters will be left for the 21st century to solve!

In recent years, the Li River Publishing House has, while publishing some domestic works, invested significant human and material resources in translating and publishing foreign literary works. The "French 20th Century Literature Series" is just one example. This undoubtedly has significance for promoting literary exchanges between China and the West.

### 五彩缤纷的“小气候”——评《法国二十世纪文学丛书》

　　五彩缤纷的“小气候”
    ——评《法国二十世纪文学丛书》
    罗嘉
    漓江出版社气概不凡，１９８６年底之前，一举推出《法国２０世纪文学丛书》，第一批书出齐七本，接着又印行了第二批七本，以奉献给爱好法国文学的读者。法国的各项文化奖，大都在每年岁尾揭榜，而圣诞节向有馈赠礼物的习俗，此时此际，书籍在法国也往往成为一份高雅而具有长久纪念意义的礼品。“漓江”出的头一批书目中，有的就曾荣获不同的文学奖，如杜拉斯的《悠悠此情》，即获１９８４年龚古尔文学奖，成为当年的畅销书，印数破百万大关。
    “丛书”的出版说明中，标举以系统介绍２０世纪法国文学为己任。从中或许可以获取一个信息，即这套丛书是对译介法国晚近作品零敲碎打、不相统属的一种超越，选择各种倾向、各种流派、各种风格、有影响、有特色的作品，力图造成一种介绍法国现当代文学的“小气候”。第一批书目，介绍的为：莫洛亚的《栗树下的晚餐》，加缪的《正义者》，杜拉斯的《广岛之恋》和《悠悠此情》，尤瑟纳尔的《东方奇观》，萨特的《魔鬼与上帝》，罗伯·葛利叶的《嫉妒》。从选目来看，既着重正宗的纯文学作品，也破除某种框框，选入趣味高雅、可读性较强的读物。
    丛书的主编，是研究法国文学的柳鸣九先生。打开书来看，１４本书中，有１３本是柳鸣九先生做的赏析性的序。
    想必主编认为，翻译出来，并不就等于完成了介绍任务。序，确乎不能少。像加缪和萨特等以思想力量见长的作家，你可以把作品从头至尾一字不漏看下来，却未必参透其思想内涵！笔者浏览了一下各序，相信柳鸣九写的序言对读者理解这些来自异域的文字不无益处。而且，序言也未必总是枯燥乏味，令人厌烦的。试看：“无济于事，她的柔情、她的怜爱、她千方百计的提示与启发，她高声的、近乎发狂的呼唤，都无济于事，都不能唤起这个男人的回忆……”你或许会以为是作品的开头，其实是《长别离》的译本序。我们有作家、小说家、散文家、批评家等名目，但尚未见有相当于法文ｐｒｅｆａｃｉｅｒ一类的“家”。相信随着《法国２０世纪文学丛书》一批批出下去，当更能看出柳鸣九先生作为“序言家”的功劳。
    《法国２０世纪文学丛书》，顾名思义，可以推知是一套译丛。第一、二批书目里的作者，有三位是诺贝尔奖作家，多位龚古尔文学奖获得者，三位法兰西学院院士，一位新小说派代表作家，二位当代法国知名女作家，可谓阵营坚强；但就译笔而言，译者似乎也不弱。有的初露头角，有的名不见经传，多半是一批中年译者。译风不是求其信达雅，便可归入传神一派。虽不能说已粗具个人风格，但已颇能看出不同特点，如有的华丽精致，有的流畅通达，有的浑雄豪迈，有的秀逸清丽，但又都以原作为依归。据悉，这批译者，大都是教学、翻译、编辑方面的骨干力量。法国有些作家爱写长句子，笔者近时看到一本法译中作品，里面一个句子竟达６５个字而无半个标点。但这套译丛，句子清通，倒还没有剪不断、理还乱的语句。原因何在？有位译者向笔者透露：丛书的多数译者之间，有条不成文的规定，最长的句子，字数不得超过２０字！那么我很纳闷，碰到为了周全而完整的表示一个复杂的意思，不得已要超过规定字数怎么办？答曰：超过２０字的，留待二十一世纪以后再去解决！
    漓江出版社近年来，在出版国内一些著作的同时，拿出相当人力、物力去译介出版外国文学作品，《法国２０世纪文学丛书》只是其中的一种，这对于开展中外文学交流，无疑是有意义的。
