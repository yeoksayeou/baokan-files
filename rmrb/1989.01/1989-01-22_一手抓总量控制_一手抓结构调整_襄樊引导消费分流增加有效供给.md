The city of Xiangfan in Hubei Province has, during the rectification and rectification period, combined total quantity control with structural adjustment. On the one hand, it has reduced the scale of construction projects and controlled the growth of consumption funds, while on the other hand, it has guided consumption to flow in different directions and increased effective supply, promoting a balance between social total demand and total supply.

Currently, Xiangfan has stopped or delayed the construction of 98 basic construction projects, reducing investment by more than 32.51 million yuan, and controlling the expenditure of consumption funds at the level of last August. While controlling the total amount of demand, Xiangfan has adjusted the demand structure and taken measures to guide the flow of consumption.

	•	It has opened savings accounts for scarce and high-end commodities, production materials reward savings, and value-preserving savings. By the end of last year, the total savings deposits in urban and rural areas across the city had increased by 5.38% compared to the end of September.

	•	It has established production standby funds. The city's agricultural bank system has guided farmers to save production standby funds at around 25 yuan per mu of cultivated land, with the city organizing a total of 1.25 billion yuan in production standby fund deposits.

	•	It has promoted risk mortgage contracting. More than 600 county-level industrial and commercial enterprises and more than 1,000 township enterprises across the city have implemented risk mortgage contracting, with a total mortgage amount of more than 10 million yuan, all of which have been concentrated for enterprise production and operation.

	•	The city has cumulatively issued stocks worth more than 80 million yuan, with more than 20 industrial and commercial enterprises issuing medium and short-term bonds to society, totaling more than 15 million yuan.

	•	By utilizing the transfer of surplus labor, it has promoted the practice of bringing in capital to enterprises. More than 500 enterprises across the city have implemented this method, attracting more than 40 million yuan in funds.

Xiangfan is also actively adjusting its industrial structure to increase effective supply. The adjustment principle is to consolidate and improve the light textile industry, gradually develop the energy and raw material base industry, vigorously develop new industries such as electronics and fine chemicals, and accelerate the development of related industries such as machinery that are compatible with the Second Automobile Works.

Recently, Xiangfan has launched 179 original material products, daily-use industrial products, and high-end durable consumer goods as key development products. Banks, material supply, and power supply departments have implemented preferential policies for these products to ensure smooth production.

Since the beginning of winter, the municipal government has invested an additional 800,000 yuan in the suburban districts for the construction of vegetable production infrastructure.

　　一手抓总量控制　一手抓结构调整
  　襄樊引导消费分流增加有效供给
    本报讯  湖北省襄樊市在治理整顿中，把总量控制与结构调整结合起来，一方面压缩基建规模，控制消费基金增长，一方面引导消费分流，增加有效供给，促进社会总需求与总供给相平衡。
    目前，襄樊市已停缓建基本建设项目９８个，压缩投资３２５１万多元，消费基金支出控制在去年８月份的水平上。在控制需求总量的同时，襄樊市调整需求结构，采取措施引导消费分流。
    ——开办紧俏高档商品储蓄、生产资料奖售储蓄、保值储蓄，到去年年底，全市城乡储蓄存款比９月底上升５．３８％。
    ——创办生产备用金存款。市农行系统引导农民按每亩耕地２５元左右储蓄生产备用资金，全市已组织生产备用金存款１．２５亿元。
    ——推行风险抵押承包。全市已有６００多个县以上工商企业、１０００多个乡镇企业实行了风险抵押承包，抵押金额１０００多万元，全部集中用于企业生产经营。
    ——全市累计发行股票金额达８０００多万元，有２０多家工商企业向社会发行了中短期债券，金额达１５００多万元。
    ——利用剩余劳动力的转移，推行带资入企。全市已有５００多家企业实行了这种办法，吸收资金达４０００多万元。
    襄樊市还积极进行产业结构的调整，增加有效供给。调整的方针是巩固提高轻纺工业，逐步开发能源、原材料基础工业，大力发展电子、精细化工等新型产业，加速发展与二汽配套的机械等相关产业。
    最近，襄樊市推出了１７９个原材料产品、适销日用工业品和高档耐用消费品，作为重点发展的产品。银行、物资、供电等部门对这些产品实行倾斜政策，保证生产顺利进行。
    入冬以来，市政府对市郊区再投入８０万元，用于蔬菜生产基础设施的建设。
