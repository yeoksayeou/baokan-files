The living and employment situations of "two types of labor" (released prisoners and those released from re-education through labor) personnel after they return to society often lead to a small number of them committing crimes again. To address this, the Public Security Bureau of Xiong County in Hebei Province has actively carried out education and guidance work for these individuals, alleviating their concerns, and reducing the recidivism rate from 8% in 1985 to the current 0.24%.

Since the "strike hard" campaign, Xiong County has arrested 431 people and sentenced them to prison terms, with 321 of them receiving short-term sentences and gradually returning to society. Around the Spring Festival in 1986, the criminal rate in Xiong County temporarily increased. Out of the 10 arrested criminals, 7 were "two types of labor" personnel who had committed crimes again. Helping them resolve their concerns is a crucial step in continuing education and guidance work to reduce recidivism.

A worker from the original paper mill in the county was released from prison but had no job, causing his emotions to fluctuate greatly. Public security officers mobilized the village committee to help him start a plastic printing factory, stabilizing his thoughts. A young man from Banbei Village, Hua, was once sentenced for theft. After his release, his family was poor, and he had no way to get rich. Public security officers acted as guarantors, helping him borrow money to buy a projector to show movies for nearby villages. Each screening earned him dozens of yuan. Hua gradually became wealthy, built a new house, and married a new wife, becoming a new person. Now, before each movie screening, he first propagandizes legal education and voluntarily shows legal education films for students.

Since 1986, Xiong County has received 407 "two types of labor" personnel, all of whom have been settled. Among these 407 released prisoners and those released from re-education through labor, 32 have become diligent, wealthy, and civilized households, 79 have become specialized households, and 261 have become law-abiding and honorable households. Three have joined the Communist Youth League, 167 have become active members in maintaining public order, and 12 have taken on leadership roles, effectively stabilizing social order. They have received praise from relevant departments and the general public.

　　重视接茬帮教　减少重新犯罪
    雄县“两劳”人员成为有用之才
    本报讯  “两劳”（劳改释放、解除劳教）人员回到社会以后生活、就业无着落，常常是导致少数人重新犯罪的原因。为此，河北省雄县公安局积极做好“两劳”人员的帮教安置工作，解除他们的后顾之忧，使“两劳”人员的重新犯罪率由１９８５年的８％下降到目前的０．２４％。
    “严打”以来，雄县有４３１人被逮捕判刑，其中３２１人被判短期徒刑，正陆续回到社会。１９８６年春节前后，雄县的刑事犯罪率一度上升。在查获的１０名作案人员中，“两劳”人员重新犯罪的就有７人。帮助他们解除后顾之忧，是搞好接茬帮教工作、减少重新犯罪的重要环节。
    该县原造纸厂有一工人刑满释放后，没有工作，情绪波动较大。公安干警动员村委会资助他办起了塑印厂，稳定了他的思想。板北村青年华某，曾因盗窃被判刑，释放回家后，家境贫困，致富无路。公安干警出面担保，帮助他贷款买了一台放映机，为邻近各村群众放映电影，每场收入几十元。华某逐渐富裕起来，盖了新房，娶了新娘，成了新人。现在，他每次放映电影前，都先宣传法制，主动为在校学生义务放映法制教育片。
    自１９８６年以来，雄县先后接收了“两劳”人员４０７人，目前已全部安置。在这４０７名劳改释放、解除劳教的人中，涌现出３２个勤劳致富文明户，７９个专业户，２６１个遵纪守法光荣户；有３人入团，１６７人成为治安积极分子，１２人担任了领导职务，有效地稳定了社会的治安秩序，受到有关部门和广大群众的好评。
