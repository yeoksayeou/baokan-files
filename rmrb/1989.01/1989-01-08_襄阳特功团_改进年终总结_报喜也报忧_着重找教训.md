The "Xiangyang Special Merit Unit" of the Nanjing Military Region recently changed its approach to the 1988 annual summary, shifting from the usual practice of advanced units and individuals rushing to write reports and share experiences in large and small meetings. Instead, they focused on summarizing mistakes and lessons learned.

This unit has performed well in various aspects of work over the past few years, with some of their experiences being promoted by the Nanjing Military Region and receiving commendations from the General Staff Department and the General Political Department. In the past, when summarizing annual work, it was common for advanced units and individuals to take the stage to share their experiences; they would be awarded banners, given prizes, and receive certificates; and finally, the printed experience materials would be distributed to various units for study.

Last year, the unit's military, political, and production work all ranked first in 19 items during the military and division evaluations. However, the party committee of the unit did not become complacent with the achievements. The commander and political commissar led by example in finding gaps and discussing the lessons learned from work mistakes. For instance, a certain company had multiple instances of party members violating discipline and poor management. During the discussion of lessons learned, they deeply reflected on neglecting party member education, lax standards for developing party members, and not promptly correcting the phenomenon of cadre detachment from soldiers. A company commander who had been awarded the title of "Model Commander" painfully summarized how his lack of self-discipline led to accepting gifts from soldiers and engaging in fights, resulting in his removal from his post and being placed under party supervision for two years. His lessons learned had a strong impact on the officers and soldiers.

　　“襄阳特功团”改进年终总结
    报喜也报忧　着重找教训
    本报讯  南京军区“襄阳特功团”最近在１９８８年年度总结中，改变“先进单位、个人忙上忙下写材料，大会小会谈经验”的做法，着重总结失误与教训。
    这个团连续几年来各项工作都做得较好，有的工作经验被南京军区推广，受到总参和总政表彰。过去每到总结年度工作时，一般都是先进连队、个人登台介绍经验；给他们授锦旗、发奖品、颁证书；最后将打印好的经验材料下发各单位学习三部曲。
    去年，这个团的军、政、生产经营等工作在军师考核评比中又获得了１９项第一。然而，团党委没有陶醉于已取得的成绩，团长和政委在总结会上带头找差距，谈工作失误的教训。某连党员违纪现象多、管理混乱，谈教训时深刻地谈出了他们平时忽视党员教育、发展党员把关不严、连队干部离兵现象不及时纠正等教训。曾被授予“带兵模范”称号的某连连长，痛心地总结了对自己要求不严，以致发展到收战士礼物、打群架，被撤销职务，留党察看两年。他的教训，引起干部战士的强烈震动。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（朱国成）
