Angola Accuses South Africa of Aiding UNITA

	Angola's Defense Minister, Tonya, accused South Africa on the 26th of continuing to provide material assistance to the Angolan rebel group, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).

	Tonya pointed out that this assistance is being delivered through areas along the Angola-Namibia border that the joint military commission of Angola, Cuba, and South Africa has not yet addressed, as well as along the Caprivi Strip.

	The New China News Agency reported from Washington on the 27th that the U.S. State Department spokesman, Redman, stated that the U.S. position of not recognizing the Angolan government and not establishing diplomatic relations with it has not changed.

	Redman said that the two main conditions for the U.S. to improve relations with Angola are the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola and the beginning of national reconciliation in Angola.

    托尼亚部长指出，这些援助是通过安哥拉—纳米比亚边境上安、古和南非联合军事委员会尚未顾及的地区以及卡普里维沿线进行的。
    新华社华盛顿１月２７日电　美国国务院发言人雷德曼今天说，美国不承认安哥拉政府和不与其建立外交关系的立场没有改变。
