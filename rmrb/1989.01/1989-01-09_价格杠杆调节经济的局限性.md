Over the past decade, price reform has achieved certain successes. The distorted price system has been corrected to some extent, the overly rigid management system has been somewhat relaxed, and a new structure with planned prices, floating prices, and market prices coexisting has been formed. The price lever has played a certain positive role. However, a series of negative impacts that have emerged, such as "once released, everything goes chaotic," uncontrollable price increases, and the fiscal difficulties faced by the state in years of economic growth, have prompted us to reflect on the difficulties and limitations of using the price lever to regulate the economy. This reflection is necessary to better understand and control this lever at a higher level.

Firstly, the necessary conditions for prices to spontaneously and positively regulate the economy are not present in China. As a result, releasing prices often leads to chaos. Marxist economics tells us that through the consistency or deviation of prices from values, the law of value can regulate the allocation of resources among various sectors according to social needs, thereby enabling the various links of the national economy to operate in an orderly manner. However, such a mechanism requires at least the following conditions:

1. The sole pursuit of enterprises, appearing as economic entities in a commodity economy, should be profit. Only then can the deviation of prices from values guide the flow of resources among sectors through the level of profits.

2. Each commodity producer should be a price taker, with no price manipulators. In other words, there should be no monopolies.

3. To ensure the free and rational flow of production factors, price information should be able to flow freely through the commodity market, and there should also be efficient capital markets, labor markets, and technology markets.

4. The government's fiscal, financial levers, and other macroeconomic policies should ensure the normal operation of this price mechanism.

5. The total social demand should not exceed the quantity allowed by resource supply to avoid universal shortages.

Obviously, these conditions are not yet met or are not mature in China. Due to the lack of these conditions, the price lever cannot function normally. If prices are simply released, it will lead to chaos. Moreover, since "perfect competition" is not the goal of China's planned commodity economy, even in the future, "spontaneous regulation" can only be conducted within a certain range.

Secondly, the price lever that consciously regulates the economy is not the most powerful and flexible lever for indirectly controlling the economy. Due to the following weaknesses in the price mechanism, it is difficult to meet the expected regulatory requirements:

1. The passivity of price signals. When supply is insufficient, price signals can only indicate that production should be expanded, but they do not specify the extent to which the scale should be expanded. This may lead to producers blindly expanding production until there is an oversupply, at which point the price signal will laggingly reflect the situation.

2. The duality of price regulation. When the price of a commodity rises, it can stimulate the growth of supply, but it will also reduce the demand for that commodity to some extent. Therefore, for commodities that need to encourage both production and consumption, or for commodities that need to restrict both production and consumption, relying solely on price regulation is ineffective. In such cases, the application of the price lever must be accompanied by fiscal levers, i.e., through taxation and financial subsidies for auxiliary regulation.

3. The chain reaction of price regulation. In today's highly developed commodity economy, many producers' products are interdependent as raw materials, forming a complex network of price relationships. When a basic product's price increases, if the increase is small, enterprises may be able to absorb it through internal efforts. However, if the increase is significant, it will inevitably trigger a series of chain reactions, leading to universal price increases or successive price increases, causing economic chaos.

4. The difference in supply and demand elasticity. For production constrained by scarce resources, the supply elasticity is small, and the price's role in driving supply growth is limited. Demand elasticity also varies by product. Some products (such as staple foods) have almost zero demand elasticity, while in China's current condition of expanding consumption funds and total demand exceeding total supply, demand elasticity is generally quite insensitive. Thus, the role of price in regulating supply and demand will inevitably be constrained to varying degrees.

Thirdly, the application of the price lever is also constrained by the fiscal capacity.

To change the long-term situation where the prices of agricultural and sideline products are lower than their value, the state has implemented a price policy of buying at a higher price and selling at a lower price, encouraging farmers' production enthusiasm. However, the state has also paid a huge price for this. Massive price subsidies have become a heavy burden on the state's finances, an important reason for the fiscal crisis, thereby weakening the role of finance as an important economic lever of the state.

I believe that the role of price reform in the national economy is mainly to establish a complete price control mechanism and use this lever to promote the adjustment of the national economic structure. If prices are not rationalized, it will not be conducive to the adjustment of the national economic structure; conversely, if the national economy is not reasonably adjusted, prices will also be difficult to rationalize, and even if they are rationalized, it will not be sustainable. It should be noted that the adjustment of the national economic structure is not limited to the use of prices alone. Only by coordinating planning, investment, taxation, credit, subsidies, and other control measures can the national economic structure be effectively adjusted.

　　价格杠杆调节经济的局限性
    吴方伟
    十年来，价格改革是有成绩的。扭曲的价格体系在一定程度上得到了矫正，管理体制统得过死的局面有所改变，形成了计划价格、浮动价格、自由价格并存的新格局，价格杠杆起到了一定的积极作用。但随之出现的一系列消极影响，如“一放就乱”，物价上涨难以控制，国家财政在经济增长之年却处境窘迫等等，也促使我们对价格杠杆调节经济的困难和局限性进行反思，以便在更高的层次上认识和驾驭这个杠杆。
    首先，价格“自发”而积极地调节经济的必要条件在我国并不具备，结果必然“一放就乱”。马克思主义经济学告诉我们，通过价格与价值的一致或背离，价值规律可以按照社会需要来调节资源在各个部门中的分配比例，从而使国民经济的各环节以有秩序的方式进行活动。但是这样一种作用机制至少需具备以下几个条件：
    １、以经济人身份出现在商品经济社会中的企业的唯一追求目标应是利润，这样价格与价值的背离才可通过利润的高低来诱导资源在部门间的流动。
    ２、每个商品生产者都应是价格的接受者，不存在价格的操纵者，换句话说，不存在垄断。
    ３、为使生产要素能合理地自由流动，价格信息要能及时地通过商品市场媒介任意流动，同时，还必须具备有效率的资金市场、劳务市场以及技术市场。
    ４、政府的财税、金融杠杆及其它宏观经济政策，要能保证这种价格机制的正常运行。
    ５、社会需求总量不能超过资源供给所容许的数量，以免出现普遍的供不应求的现象。
    显然，上述条件在我国还不具备或不成熟。由于缺乏上述条件，价格杠杆并不能正常发挥调节作用，这时如果单纯放开价格，反而会出现“一放就乱”的局面。同时，由于“完全竞争”并不是我国有计划商品经济的目标，因而就是在将来，“自发调节”也只能在一定范围内进行。
    其次，所谓自觉调节的价格杠杆也不是间接调控经济的最有力、最灵活的杠杆。由于价格机制本身有以下一些弱点，使其难以满足人们预期的调节要求：
    １、价格信号的消极性。当供不应求时，价格信号只能告诉人们应该扩大生产，但并未告诉人们规模应扩大到什么程度，这就有可能造成生产者盲目扩大生产，直到供过于求时，价格信号才又滞后地反映出来。
    ２、价格调节的双向性。当某种商品价格升高时，可以刺激生产供应的增长，但同时也会多少削减对该种商品的消费需求。因此在政策上对某些需要鼓励生产与消费的商品，或是既要限制生产又要抑制消费的商品，单靠价格调节就显得无能为力。在这种情况下，价格杠杆的应用就必须有财政杠杆的配合，即通过税收和财政补贴进行辅助调节。
    ３、价格调节的连锁性。在商品经济高度发展的今天，许多生产者的产品互为原料，形成一个错综复杂的价格关系网络。当某一基础产品提价时，如果幅度很小，企业尚有可能通过内部挖潜来消化，但如幅度较大，则必然引起一系列连锁反应，出现普遍涨价或轮番涨价，造成整个经济的混乱。
    ４、价格的供给弹性与需求弹性的差异性。对于受稀缺资源约束的生产来说，其供给弹性较小，价格拉动供给增长的作用很有限。需求弹性也因产品而异。有些产品（如口粮）的需求弹性几乎为零，而在我国目前消费基金膨胀，总需求大于总供给的条件下，需求弹性普遍都比较迟钝。这样，靠价格来调节供求的作用势必受到不同程度的制约。
    再次，价格杠杆应用的范围、启动幅度还不能不受制于财政的承受能力。
    国家为了改变农副产品价格长期低于价值的状况，实行了购销倒挂的价格政策，鼓励了农民的生产积极性，但财政为此也付出了巨额代价。巨额的价格补贴已成为国家财政的沉重包袱，是财政陷入困境的一个重要原因，从而弱化了财政作为国家重要经济杠杆的作用。
    我认为价格改革在国民经济中的作用，主要是要建立完善的价格调控机制，利用这个杠杆来促进国民经济结构的调整。价格不理顺则不利于国民经济结构的调整；反过来，国民经济得不到合理调整，价格也难以理顺，即使理顺了亦难持久。应该看到，进行国民经济结构的调整决不仅仅限于价格一种手段，只有使计划、投资、税收、信贷、补贴等调控手段协调起来，才能有效地调整国民经济结构。
