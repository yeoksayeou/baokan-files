A blood type testing kit with international advanced standards, the "Anti-Human A, B Blood Type Detection Test Kit," has recently passed the provincial-level technical appraisal in Zhejiang Province.

This reagent uses anti-human A-type and B-type red blood cell monoclonal antibodies to identify blood types. Compared to the standard sera currently in use domestically, it has several advantages: first, it has strong specificity and does not contain other system antibodies, making the typing accurate and reliable; second, it has high sensitivity, and regardless of the strength of the blood's antigenicity or the age of the person being tested, the blood type is clear at a glance; third, it standardizes blood type reagents, avoiding misidentification of blood types. This reagent can also identify the blood type of old bloodstains. Production has been organized by the Shenzhen Xindi Medical and Chemical Co., Ltd. and Zhejiang Medical University.

　　鉴定血型  准确可靠
    血型检测试剂盒国内首创
    本报讯  一种具有国际先进水平的血型检验制剂——“抗人Ａ、Ｂ血型检测试剂盒”，最近通过浙江省省级技术鉴定。
    该试剂采用抗人Ａ型、Ｂ型红细胞单克隆抗体鉴定血型。与国内目前通用的标准血清相比，具有多方面的优点：一是特异性强，不含其它系统抗体，定型准确可靠；二是灵敏程度高，无论血的抗原性强弱，受检者年龄大小，其血型均一目了然；三是实现了血型试剂标准化，避免了误定血型。该试剂还能鉴定出陈旧性血迹的血型。深圳市新迪医化有限公司和浙江医科大学已组织生产。
