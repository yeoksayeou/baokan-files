	The successful launch of the space shuttle is a remarkable achievement in human space technology. However, many scientists in the Soviet Union and the United States have pointed out that the space shuttle consumes a large amount of funds that should be used for basic scientific research, and that manned flights are unnecessary for most scientific research.

	How much is the space shuttle worth? According to reports, after the "Challenger" space shuttle was destroyed two years ago, the United States spent $2.5 billion to refurbish the "Discovery." The military satellite on board the "Atlantis," launched on December 2, is worth $500 million. The Soviet Union's "Buran" costs $10 billion. Therefore, some scientists in the Soviet Union and the United States believe that launching space shuttles now is not worth the cost.

	The famous Soviet scientist Sagdeyev believes that the implementation of the space shuttle program by the Soviet Union and the United States is a costly mistake. He said, "The space shuttle is a technology of the 21st century. Why should we spend money from the 20th century on the 21st century?"

　　苏美不少科学家认为——
    发射航天飞机得不偿失
    航天飞机发射成功，是人类太空科技的杰出成就。然而，苏美也有不少科学家指出：航天飞机消耗掉大量本应用于基础科学的费用；航天飞机载人飞行，对大部分科研并无必要。
    航天飞机价值多少？据报道，在“挑战者”号航天飞机两年前机毁人亡后，美国为了改装“发现”号就花掉２５亿美元。１２月２日发射的“阿特兰蒂斯”号，仅机上的军事卫星就价值５亿美元。苏联的“暴风雪”号造价是１００亿美元。因此，苏美有些科学家认为，现在发射航天飞机得不偿失。
    苏联著名科学家萨格德耶夫认为，苏美实施航天飞机计划，是超前的代价高昂的错误。他说：“航天飞机是２１世纪的技术，为什么我们要把用在２０世纪的钱花在２１世纪呢？”
