    China's livestock industry has seen sustained and steady development over the past decade, transforming from a past where it was dependent on "agriculture's sideline" to a relatively independent sector. The proportion of livestock industry output value in the total agricultural output value has increased from 14.95% in 1978 to 20%.

    According to recent data from the livestock industry, in 1988, the total meat production in China reached 23.2 million tons, ranking second in the world. Egg production was 6.44 million tons, ranking first in the world. Milk production reached 4.16 million tons, a 3.3-fold increase over 1978. The output value of the livestock industry reached 64.67 billion yuan, an increase of 1.48 times over 1978, with an average annual growth rate of 9.5%.

    Last year, China's per capita meat consumption reached 21.2 kilograms, eggs 5.9 kilograms, and milk 3.8 kilograms. The average annual increase in meat, eggs, and milk provided by livestock production to society is 7.2%.

    Over the past 10 years, the state and local governments have invested more than 3.5 billion yuan to build 419 livestock commercial production bases. Among them, there are 240 commercial lean meat pig bases, 69 commercial cattle bases, and 46 commercial poultry, eggs, milk (wool) goats, mutton sheep, meat rabbits, bees, and other specialty livestock product bases.

    In 1988, the proportion of pork in China's total meat production decreased from over 90% in 1978 to 81%, making the meat structure more reasonable.

　　我国畜牧业形成相对独立产业
    去年产值占农业总产值五分之一
    本报北京１月１１日讯  新华社记者鹿永建、本报记者黄彩忠报道：我国畜牧业１０年来持续稳步发展，已由过去依附于“副业的农业”转变为相对独立的产业，畜牧业产值占农业总产值的比重由１９７８年的１４．９５％提高到２０％。
    据畜牧部门新近提供的情况，１９８８年全国肉类总产量达２３２０万吨，跃居世界第２位，禽蛋产量为６４４万吨，跃居世界首位，奶类产量达４１６万吨，也比１９７８年增长３．３倍。畜牧业产值达到６４６．７亿元，比１９７８年增加１．４８倍，平均年递增９．５％。
    去年，我国人均占有肉类已达２１．２公斤，禽蛋５．９公斤，奶类３．８公斤。畜牧生产向社会提供的肉蛋奶平均每年递增７．２％。
    １０年中，国家和地方共投资３５亿多元，先后建设了４１９个畜牧业商品生产基地，其中商品瘦肉型猪基地２４０个，商品牛基地６９个，禽蛋禽肉、奶（绒）山羊、肉羊、肉兔、蜂及其它特种畜产品基地４６个。
    １９８８年，我国猪肉占肉类总产量中的比重由１９７８年的９０％以上降至８１％，肉类结构趋向合理。
