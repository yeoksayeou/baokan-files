On New Year's Eve, the Hernandez family, spanning four generations, gathered together. The eldest daughter, Marta, led the family in a midnight prayer; they then shared a turkey dinner and New Year's Eve feast. After that, they sang, danced, and drank until the early morning, before exchanging greetings and going their separate ways. Year after year, the family always celebrates in this joyful manner. On New Year's Eve, no one would miss it for any reason, even divorced sons-in-law and grandsons-in-law who had not remarried would return on this day to celebrate. Marta always reminds the children that their great-grandparents are the elders of the family, and we should bless them. Thus, the entire family takes turns going to the Hernandez elderly couple, giving them a kiss, and seeking their blessings. The elderly Hernandez, over eighty years old, uses his trembling hand to draw a cross on the forehead of the younger generation.

This is a typical middle-class Mexican family. Not only during festivals, but even every Sunday, Marta and her sisters will return to their parents' home. I have spent three Christmas holidays and several Sundays with them. It can be said that the traditional Mexican family has not disintegrated with the changes of modern society. Most Mexicans still live in families centered around the elders. The elderly are willing to live with their descendants and even take care of the third generation for divorced children, living a large family life. On birthdays and holidays, most Mexicans will gather together like the Hernandez family. For Mexicans, the person closest to the family, outside of the family, is the child's godfather. In this case, the godfather is often regarded as a family member.

Industrialization and urbanization are causing changes in the traditional family life of Mexicans. The descendants of farmers no longer want to stay on the land tilled by their ancestors; they leave home to find work. The children of upper-middle-class families are increasingly going abroad to study and are more influenced by American lifestyles. The moral influence of religion is declining in many middle-class families. Sexual freedom and the use of contraceptives are gradually changing traditional gender relationships. Divorce and abandonment of children are becoming more common.

In the era of the Aztec Indians, Mexican women, like women in old China, were bound by arranged marriages and spent their lives obeying their husbands and bearing children. Mexican men regarded women as appendages of the family. However, contemporary Mexican women not only have the right to vote but also have more opportunities to participate in politics and employment. When Salinas took office as president, it happened that the chairperson of the parliament that month was a female legislator. Thus, for the first time in Mexican history, a woman presented the presidential sash, symbolizing power, to the new president.

Although women have gained status in society and the family, mothers still teach their sons: "You should be as manly as your father." This is because the traditional family concept still regards the husband as the core of the family, and the family as the axis of life. This point has not changed for most Mexicans due to the modernization of society. Factory workers and office employees are willing to marry within their circles; officials always place their relatives in their respective institutions. Even many modern large enterprises and conglomerates have long adhered to family rule and management. The son inherits the father's business, and relatives can and should occupy high positions in their own enterprises. I once visited a large conglomerate in the industrial city of Monterrey in the north, which owns dozens of modern enterprises, including multinational corporations. The general manager is the chairman's son. He proudly told the guests: "Our conglomerate belongs to the family." The deep-rooted family concept of Mexicans believes that using one's own people is more reliable. Therefore, even now, part of Mexico's economy is still operating with the family as the axis.

The family is the cell of society, and society will inevitably reflect the existence of the family to a certain extent. Sociologists believe that the relative stability of the Mexican family is also a factor in the stability of Mexican society.

The family has passed down social traditions, values, and religious beliefs. The traditional patriarchal way of life has shaped Mexicans to be more accustomed to accepting the coordination of the ruling class in social affairs. Perhaps this is one of the factors why the economic crisis in Mexico has not led to social unrest.

　　墨西哥人
    （二）家庭篇
    本报记者  郭伟成
    除夕，埃尔南德斯一家四代人欢聚一堂。大女儿玛尔塔领着全家作午夜祷告；一起吃火鸡、年夜饭。然后歌舞饮酒、直到凌晨以后，才互致问候，各自散去。年复一年，全家人总是这样愉快地共度良宵。新年除夕，谁也不会以任何理由缺席，甚至连离了婚而尚未再婚的女婿、孙女婿也仍然在这一天回来过节。大女儿玛尔塔总是告诉孩子们，曾祖父、曾祖母是家里的长辈，我们要祝福他们。于是，全家人依次到埃尔南德斯老俩口跟前，给老人一个吻，祈求老人的赐福。八十多岁的埃尔南德斯老人用颤巍巍的手在晚辈额上划个十字。
    这是一个典型的墨西哥中产阶级家庭。不但过节，即使每个星期日，玛尔塔姐妹们也会回到老父母跟前。我曾与他们一起度过３次圣诞节，若干个星期日。可以说，墨西哥的传统式家庭还没有随着现代社会的变化而解体。大多数墨西哥人还是生活在以长辈为核心的家庭里。老人愿意和子孙们生活在一起，甚至乐意为离异的子女抚育第三代，过着大家庭的生活。逢到生日、节假日，大多数墨西哥人都会像埃尔南德斯家一样，照例聚在一起。对墨西哥人来说，家庭之外最亲近的人是孩子的教父。在这种情况下，教父往往被视为家庭成员之一。
    工业化与都市化使墨西哥人传统的家庭生活方式正在发生某些变化。农民的后代不愿再守着祖辈耕耘的土地，他们弃家外出找寻工作。中上层家庭的子女，越来越多地到国外去学习，更多地接受了美国的生活方式。宗教的道德感化作用在许多中产阶级家庭里下降了。性自由与避孕药具的使用，逐渐改变着传统的男女关系。离婚、弃儿现象日益增多。
    在印第安阿兹特克人的时代，墨西哥妇女与旧中国妇女的命运一样，被父母的包办婚姻束缚一生，顺从丈夫、作生儿育女的工具。墨西哥的男人则把女人看作家庭的附属物。但是，当代的墨西哥妇女不仅获得了选举权，而且参政、就业的机会也越来越多。萨利纳斯总统就职时，碰巧议会当月主席轮到一位女议员。于是，在墨西哥历史上，第一次由一位妇女把象征权力的总统绶带授给新总统。
    虽然妇女在社会上与家庭中都有了地位，做母亲的仍然会这样教导儿子：“你应当像你的爸爸那样有男子气。”因为传统的家庭观念仍然认为丈夫是家庭的核心，家庭则是生活的轴心。这一点，对大多数墨西哥人来说并没有因为社会的现代化而改变。工厂职工和机关工作人员乐意在彼此间联姻、结亲；当官的总是把家属塞进所属的机构里。连许多现代化的大企业、财团也一直沿袭着家族统治和管理。父业子承，家属至少可以而且应该在自己的企业里占据高位。我曾在北方工业城市蒙特雷参观过一家拥有几十个现代化企业、包括跨国公司的大财团。总经理是董事长的儿子。他自豪地对客人说：“我们这个财团是属于家族的。”墨西哥人根深蒂固的家庭观念认为，用自己人总是比较靠得住。因此，直到现在，墨西哥经济的一部分仍然是以家族为轴心来运转的。
    家庭是社会的细胞，社会当然会在一定程度上反映家庭的存在。社会学家认为，墨西哥家庭的相对稳定，也是墨西哥社会稳定的因素。
    家庭延续了社会的传统、价值观念和宗教信仰。传统的家长制生活方式的熏陶，造成了墨西哥人比较习惯于接受社会统治集团对社会事务的协调。也许，这就是墨西哥的经济危机始终没有引起社会动乱的因素之一。
