The Chinese Academy of Sciences Eastern Company, originally focused on importing scientific instruments and equipment, has shifted its business emphasis to exporting technology and technological products over the past few years. The company's export volume reached $10 million in 1988.

The technology for producing vitamin C, which was once the largest technology export in the country, was handled by the Eastern Scientific Instruments Import and Export Company. Now, they have invested a considerable amount of effort into exporting high-tech products and technologies. For instance, the radar tunable tubes developed by the Institute of Electronics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the barium borate nonlinear optical crystals from the Institute of Materials Structure of Fujian, and the BGO crystals from the Shanghai Institute of Silicate, all have their exports managed by the Eastern Company.

The company was established in 1980. The current general manager, Qu Shouci, was one of the founders. He told reporters today that the company's main clients are the research institutes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and they also handle technology export tasks for some external units.

To expand technology exports, especially to enable Southeast Asian countries to utilize Chinese technology, they established companies such as the Eastern Company in Thailand.

Qu Shouci said that to capture the international market in high-tech, one must first establish a foothold in the domestic market. The nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometers produced by the Wuhan Institute of Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the microcomputers produced by the Information and Communication Company, the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry systems, and scanning electron microscopes produced by the Scientific Instruments Factory, which they represent, recently secured the top spots in the bidding for a World Bank loan project. This loan is intended for purchasing scientific research and teaching equipment for domestic universities, with a total loan amount of approximately $50 million. The Eastern Company won 6 items, with a contract amount of over $9 million, accounting for 18% of the total loan and about 40% of the domestic winning projects. Most of these winning projects are high-tech products that the Eastern Company organized for import, domestically digested, and absorbed before production.

General Manager Qu also revealed that to meet the needs of domestic scientific research, the Eastern Company has set up a "supermarket" for small instruments and components. A "market" for chemical reagents is also planned. Small quantities of items needed for scientific research and teaching will no longer need to be ordered from abroad.

### 中科院东方公司致力技术出口  去年出口额达千万美元

　　中科院东方公司致力技术出口
    去年出口额达千万美元
    本报北京１月１６日讯  记者陈祖甲报道：原先着重进口科学仪器和设备的中国科学院东方公司，近几年把业务重点转到技术和技术产品的出口上。这个公司１９８８年的出口额达到１０００万美元。
    曾经是国内最大额技术出口的维生素Ｃ生产技术，就是东方科学仪器进出口公司经办的。现在，他们已把相当多的力量花在高技术及产品的出口上。像中科院电子所研制的雷达用速调管、福建物构所的偏硼酸钡非线性光学晶体、上海硅酸盐所的ＢＧＯ晶体出口，都由东方公司代理。
    这家公司成立于１９８０年，现任总经理曲守慈是当时创办人之一。他今天对记者说，公司的主要服务对象是中科院的研究所，同时还代理了部分院外单位的技术出口任务。
    为了扩大技术出口，特别是让东南亚国家利用中国的技术，他们成立了泰国东方公司等公司。
    曲守慈说，在高技术方面占领国际市场，首先要在国内市场站住脚。他们代理的中科院武汉物理所生产的核磁共振波谱仪、信通公司生产的微型计算机、科仪厂生产的色质谱联用仪、扫描电子显微镜等技术产品，最近在世界银行贷款项目的招标中夺得榜首。这项款是用于为国内的高等学校购买科研、教学仪器设备的，全部款项约５０００万美元。东方公司中标６项，签约金额达到９００多万美元，占全部贷款的１８％，为国内中标项目的４０％左右。而这些中标项目，大多又是东方公司组织引进、经过国内消化、吸收后生产的高技术产品。
    曲总经理还透露，为了满足国内科学研究的需要，东方公司办起了小型仪器、元器件的“超级市场”，化学试剂“市场”也将创办。科研、教学中需要的小量用品，不用到国外预订了。
