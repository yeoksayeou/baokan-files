Your newspaper published a letter from a reader titled "Hanging Sleepers" with a photograph on the fifth page on April 27, 1988. The provincial government, the Jinan Railway Bureau, and the Qingdao Railway Division immediately studied remedial measures, allocated 570,000 yuan, and rushed to repair the site. Now, a retaining wall 2 meters deep, 1.5 meters high, and 280 meters long has been built, and the track has been repaired. To prevent damage to the road shoulder and sleepers due to improper loading and unloading, the Xiaoying Station has taken three measures: first, to strengthen education among the workers of the township loading and unloading teams to consciously protect railway equipment; second, to demarcate cargo areas, assign specific personnel to specific locations and machines for loading and unloading; third, to strengthen the management of transport vehicles, and to equip a crane to facilitate the loading and unloading of bulky goods such as logs.

　　拨款筑路保障行车安全
    你报１９８８年４月２７日第五版刊登《悬空的枕木》的读者来信和照片，省政府、济南铁路局和青岛铁路分局立即研究整治措施，拨款５．７万元，全力抢修，现已筑砌了深２米、高１．５米、长２８０米的路肩挡墙，并维修了线路。为了防止由于乱装乱卸、砸坏路肩和枕木的事，小营车站还采取了三条措施：一、对乡镇装卸队职工加强自觉爱护铁路设备的教育；二、划分货区，定人定位定机装卸；三、加强运输机动车辆的管理，自配吊车一部，以便装卸圆木等笨重货物。
