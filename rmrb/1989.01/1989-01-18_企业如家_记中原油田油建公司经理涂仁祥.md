The employees of the Zhongyuan Oilfield Oil Construction Company compare their manager to the head of a household. The 44-year-old manager, Tu Renshang, says, "The enterprise is like a family, and the manager should be a good head of the household."

The saying goes, "It's hard to manage a poor household," and managing a household starts with managing poverty. Tu Renshang began with "working hard and earning money" and implemented the "100-yuan output value package" reform for the company. This manager, who transferred from the military, worked as a pipe fitter in the oilfield, and also attended university, understands the importance of morale in improving efficiency and increasing benefits. Tu Renshang leads by example, and wherever there is a tough battle, his short hair will be seen there, standing on end. During the oil rush in Weixian, the Third Brigade worked for 100 consecutive days without leaving the site. Tu Renshang had stomach problems and mixed vegetables with rice to swallow; when he had a stomach hemorrhage, he still directed production with the help of others. As he puts it, "To make the reform understood and supported by the masses, one must lead by example and move people's hearts. Only then will there be a group of determined soldiers around you."

Morale gradually became the "family tradition." In the oilfield, who doesn't know that the oil construction workers compete for jobs and rush to complete them, working so efficiently that one person can do the work of two or three? At critical moments, even their wives and children join in. Because of this, the company's construction and installation volume, labor productivity, output value, and benefits have been at the top of the national petroleum industry for several years, and the quality of the projects has also won numerous awards. To ensure quality, Tu Renshang even earned the nickname "Tu Scorpion"!

The 42nd Oil Station built by the Youth Brigade has been named the "Youth League Excellent Work Number" and a monument was erected. Tu Renshang, overjoyed, personally inspected the site and discovered problems with the foundation settlement and pipe leakage. He roared, "Demolish the monument! Rebuild!" Tu Manager is known for his strictness and severity, and the company's reputation has taken root both inside and outside the oilfield.

The company's contributions to the state are significant, and the workers should not be shortchanged. Tu Renshang understands this and works to improve everyone's living conditions. After achieving a new record of 1.4 billion yuan in construction and installation volume this year, workers' wages can be doubled compared to before the reform, and the average annual household income can increase by 2,000 yuan. In recent years, the company has successively built a staff club, a modern lighting plastic ball court, and a cold storage for food, and especially enviable are the staff residential buildings hidden among green trees, flower beds, rockeries, and fountains. Even newlyweds can live in a new apartment, ending the history of oilfield production and life being difficult to balance.

However, the improvement of living conditions can only satisfy people's desires at a lower level, and most people pay more attention to the realization of value. Tu Renshang understands this modern psychology and strives to make everyone work happily and find their place. A young worker publicly challenged a visiting inspection team: "If you have the ability, come and do it yourself. If you can do it, then come and inspect others!" From this outburst, Tu Renshang sensed a sense of frustration. Instead of simply criticizing, he promoted the young man to squad leader after an investigation. During a special construction project, this newly appointed squad leader used his leg as a support to weld the seam, burning his pants and legs with countless blisters, earning the entire team the honorable title of "Gold Medal Team" from the Petroleum Department. This incident convinced people of the manager's tolerance and courage in using people.

"Working hard is not tiring, getting on the car and being able to sleep, drinking alcohol and not getting drunk, and the wife saying whatever she wants," is a self-portrait of oil construction workers who have been working outside for a long time. The latter sentence reflects the influence of family members on the workers. Tu Renshang is well aware of this family relationship in the oilfield and has included family work in the company's scope, successively establishing more than ten collective factories such as steel window factories, cement pole factories, cow hair blanket factories, elbow factories, and valve factories that serve oil construction, providing decent jobs for 20,000 family members, and also evaluating and ranking them, allowing them to participate in company management.

Tu Renshang has won the hearts of oil construction workers and their families. Workers ask him to officiate at their weddings, couples ask him to mediate their disputes, and children ask him for advice on finding a partner... People place their sense of trust and belonging in this manager and learn from his words and deeds what real reform is all about.

　　企业如家
    ——记中原油田油建公司经理涂仁祥
    本报记者  魏亚南
    “一台戏，他就是戏桩子；一个家，他就是当家的。”中原油田油建公司的职工把他们的经理比作当家的。今年４４岁的涂仁祥经理说：“企业如家，当经理的就应当是个好当家人。”
    俗话说，“穷家难守”，治家先得治穷。涂仁祥从“干死活，挣死钱”开刀，对公司施行“百元产值含量包干”的改革手术。这位从部队转业，在油田当过管子工，又上过大学的经理，懂得士气对于提高效率，增加效益的重要。涂仁祥以身教治家，哪里有攻坚战，他那小平头就会在哪里怒发冲冠。三大队在威县抢油会战，涂仁祥也连续一百天没离工地，胃病犯了，将菜混在饭里往下咽；胃出血了，还在人掺扶下指挥生产。用他的话说：“要使改革得到群众的理解和支持吗？那就得以身示范，让人动心才行。这样，在你周围才会有一群必胜的哀兵。”
    士气慢慢变成了“家风”，在油田谁不知道油建职工争活、抢活，干起活来一个顶俩、顶仨，紧要关头老婆孩子齐下火龙关。凭这，公司连续几年建筑安装工作量、劳动生产率、产值和效益均居全国石油行业之首，工程质量也在评比中连连夺魁。为了保证质量，涂仁祥还落了个“涂蝎子”的绰号呢！
    青年队建筑安装的四十二号油站，已被命名为“共青团全优工号”，并竖了碑。涂仁祥高兴之余亲自验收，发现了地基下沉和管子渗漏的问题。只听他大吼一声：“砸碑！重建！”涂经理以又严又狠出了名，公司的信誉也在油田内外扎了根。
    公司对国家的贡献大了，职工也不能亏着。涂仁祥把住这个理儿，设法改善大家的生活条件。今年拿下１．４亿元的建筑安装工程量新纪录后，职工工资可比改革前提高两倍，家庭年平均收入可增加两千元。这几年，公司相继建起了职工俱乐部、现代化的灯光塑胶球场和副食冷藏库，特别令人艳羡的是那掩映在绿树、花圃、假山、喷泉中的幢幢职工住宅楼，即使是新婚之家也能住上一套新房，结束了油田生产、生活难以兼顾的历史。
    然而，生活条件的改善，只能使人的欲望得到低层次的满足，多数人更注重价值的实现。涂仁祥深知这种现代人的心理，尽量使大家愉快工作，各得其所。一位年轻工人公开顶撞上边来的检查团道：“有本事一块干干，能行再来检查别人！”从这番狂言浪语中，涂仁祥感觉出一种怀才不遇的宣泄。他不但没有简单地批评，反而经过考察让这小伙子当了中队长。在一次特殊施工中，这位新任的中队长用腿当支架对焊缝，裤子烧烂了，腿也烧出了无数血泡，使全队赢得了石油部“金牌队”的光荣称号。这件事使人信服了经理的容人之量和用人之胆。
    “干活不怕累，上车就能睡，喝酒不会醉，老婆咋说咋对”，是长年在外施工的油建工人的自我写照。这后一句，反映了家属对职工的影响作用。涂仁祥深谙油田的这种家庭关系，把家属工作纳入了公司范畴，先后筹建了钢窗厂、水泥杆厂、牛毛毡厂、弯头厂、阀门厂等十多个为油建服务的集体厂，使两万名家属有了像样的工作，还为他们考核定级，让他们参与公司管理。
    涂仁祥赢得了油建职工及家属的心，职工结婚找他证婚，两口子打架要他评理，孩子找对象请他参谋……人们把信任感、归宿感，寄托在这位经理身上，并从他的一言一行中领悟到了实实在在的改革是怎么回事。
