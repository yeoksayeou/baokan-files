On October 26, 1988, the anniversary of Chinese football breaking out of Asia, the Beijing City Football Fans Association was also established on that day. Many people might not have expected that the president of this fans association is a paralyzed girl in a wheelchair, Wu Jinghong.

Wu is 20 years old this year. Due to congenital spina bifida, she is paralyzed in her lower limbs. In her life, she has never left footprints on this land. When she was young, her loving mother took care of her. At the age of 12, her mother closed her sad eyes, and she fell into a situation where she could hardly move.

By chance, she watched a football match. A player with a head wrapped in bandages fighting tenaciously left a deep impression on her. She thought, shouldn't she also fight tenaciously on the green field of life like an athlete?

Since then, Wu Jinghong often goes to watch football matches. She got to know the famous figures in Chinese football, Li Fusheng, Yang Zhaohui, Wu Qunli, Gao Hongbo... From then on, the road from Chaoyangmen to the training field at Xiannongtan often appeared a girl's figure in a wheelchair. Wu Jinghong gained the courage to live and the determination to struggle from the athletes. She saved her pocket money bit by bit to subscribe to six or seven newspapers and magazines such as "Sports Newspaper," "Football World," and "World Sports Reference." She never missed any of the more influential matches in the capital and wrote her own match reviews. In 1984, her first match review was published in "Sports Weekly," and then she sent the manuscript fee to the Asian Cup football preliminary competition committee. That year, she was accepted as a lifetime member of the Beijing City Football Club.

A girl with paralyzed legs is particularly fond of football, just like her life path is full of difficulties and twists and turns. Once, she went to the Workers' Stadium to watch a football match in the evening. Unfortunately, it rained in the middle of the match. On her way back, her wheelchair overturned, and her hands and feet were injured. When she groped her way back home, it was already past one in the morning.

Little Wu sometimes feels a bit confused, but she is more full of hope. Football raised the sails of her life. Football stars like Li Fusheng and Yang Zhaohui often write letters to encourage her, and every time they return from an overseas match, they remember to bring her souvenirs.

She deeply understands that Chinese football, which is difficult to walk, needs not the raised arms after success, but the understanding and caring hearts in difficult times. She decided to organize a fans association to build a bridge of communication between fans and athletes. Shaking her wheelchair, she made trip after trip to the relevant departments. After arduous preparations, the fans association was finally established.

　　爱足球的瘫痪姑娘
    沈根均　刘薇 
    １９８８年１０月２６日，是中国足球冲出亚洲的周年纪念日，北京市球迷（足球）协会也在这一天成立。许多人也许料想不到，这个球迷协会的会长竟是一位坐在轮椅上的残疾姑娘吴京红。
    小吴今年２０岁。由于先天性脊椎裂，她下肢瘫痪。在她生活的这块土地上，从没印下她的足迹。幼时，有慈母照料她。１２岁时，母亲合上了忧郁的双眼，她落入了寸步难行的境地。
    一个偶然的机会，她看了一场足球比赛。一位头包纱布的运动员顽强拚搏的英姿，给她留下了深刻的印象。她想，自己不也应该像运动员那样在人生的绿茵场上拚搏么？
    从那以后，吴京红经常去看足球赛。她结识了中国足坛的新闻人物李富胜、杨朝晖、吴群立、高洪波……从此，从朝阳门到先农坛训练场的路上，经常出现一个摇着轮椅的少女身影。吴京红从运动员身上获得了生活的勇气和奋斗的信念。她一分一分地省下零用钱，订阅了《体育报》、《足球世界》、《世界体育参考》等六七种报刊。京城较有影响的比赛，她场场不落，还把自己的观感写成球评。１９８４年，她的第一篇球评发表在《体育周报》上，然后她将稿酬寄给了亚洲杯足球预赛组委会。同年，她被北京市足球俱乐部吸收为终身会员。
    一个双腿瘫痪的姑娘偏要钟情于足球事业，这就像她的人生之路一样充满艰难和曲折。一次，她晚上去工人体育场看足球比赛。不料，中途下起雨来。回家的路上，轮椅翻倒了，手脚跌破了。当她摸索回到家时，已是凌晨一点多钟了。
    小吴虽然有时也感到一些迷茫，但更多的还是充满希望。足球，扬起了她生命的风帆。李富胜、杨朝晖等足球名将也经常写信鼓励她，每次出国比赛回来总忘不了给她送来纪念品。
    她深深懂得，步履艰难的中国足球，最需要的不是成功后高扬的双臂，而是艰难时刻那一颗颗理解和关切的心。她决心组织一个球迷协会，在球迷和运动员之间搭起一座相互沟通的桥梁。摇着轮椅，她一趟趟往返于有关部门。经过艰苦的筹备，球迷协会终于成立了。
