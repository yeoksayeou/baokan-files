	Wu Wenying Discusses with Managers of Beijing's Four Major Department Stores
	Textile Industry Department to Ensure Market Supply

	BEIJING, Jan. 27 (Xinhua) -- Wu Wenying, Minister of the Textile Industry, invited managers of Beijing's four major department stores -- Beijing Department Store, Dong'an Market, Xidan Market, and Longfu Department Store -- for a discussion on Jan. 27. The purpose was to understand consumer demand, exchange information, and discuss ways to increase the effective supply of textiles in the market.

	The managers of the four major department stores, based on the current sales trends of textiles, made the following suggestions and demands to the textile industry:

	-- Leverage the advantages of "large-scale textile production" to increase the proportion of finished products such as clothing. In recent years, the clothing and knitted goods market has been exceptionally active, with new styles of clothing, such as jackets, seeing a sharp increase in sales. It is suggested to leverage the advantages of large-scale textile production to increase the production and supply of various grades and specifications of new-style clothing and finished products such as bedspreads, pillowcases, and curtains, which will not only be convenient for the public but also save raw materials.

	-- Adjust the structure of textile products and increase the supply of marketable products. Develop more new types of synthetic fiber clothing fabrics that are fashionable and elegant, and reduce the consumption of natural fibers that are expensive and high in price, such as pure wool textiles.

	-- Rationalize prices, improve quality, and ensure the supply of daily necessities. Over the past year, the prices of most textiles have risen sharply. Beijing Department Store reported that from January to August 1988, the average price of cotton, silk, and wool textiles increased by 28% to 38%, while the quality has declined, which has caused dissatisfaction among consumers. Some daily necessities, such as white cloth, have been out of stock for a long time due to strict price controls by the state, making it difficult for state-owned commercial enterprises to procure them. The four major department stores have not been able to sell these products for over half a year, and people who need them for bedding have to buy them at high prices from individual vendors and collective small shops. This situation should be changed as soon as possible.

	After listening to the managers' opinions, Wu Wenying said that the textile industry must, despite the shortages of raw materials, energy, and funds, do everything possible to increase the effective supply to the market. The industry should focus on optimizing product structure, increasing marketable products, and ensuring a good supply for the Spring Festival market.

	Currently, textile enterprises are actively developing new synthetic fiber products and various blended and mixed fiber new products. They are accelerating the development of high-grade knitted products and actively developing various types of clothing, fashionable clothing, and indoor decorative items. To enrich the summer clothing fabrics, efforts are being made to trial-produce new synthetic fiber fabrics that mimic real silk and clothing. A "Summer Clothing Fabric Exhibition and Sale" will be held in late spring and early summer, inviting consumers to inspect textile products.

　　吴文英同首都四大商场经理对话    
    纺织部将力保市场供应
    本报讯  记者李茜报道：纺织工业部部长吴文英于１月２７日邀请北京百货大楼、东安市场、西单商场、隆福大厦四大百货商场经理对话，了解消费者需求，交流信息，讨论增加纺织品市场有效供给问题。
    四大商场的经理们根据当前纺织品的销售趋势，对纺织部门的生产和供应提出如下建议和要求：
    ——发挥“大纺织”的优势，增产服装等制成品的比例。近年来服装和针织品市场空前活跃，时装、茄克等款式新颖的服装销量骤增，建议发挥大纺织的优势，多增加各种档次、各种规格的新式服装和床罩、被罩、窗帘等成品的生产和供给，既方便群众，又节约原料。
    ——调整纺织品结构，增加适销对路产品。多开发花样新、色调雅的新型仿毛、仿丝的化纤服装面料，压缩天然纤维消耗高、价格昂贵的纯毛纺织品。
    ——理顺价格，提高质量，保证人民生活必需品的供应。一年多来，多数纺织品价格大幅度上涨。百货大楼１９８８年１月和８月相比，棉、丝、毛纺织品平均提价２８％—３８％，而质量却在下降，消费者很有意见。还有些生活必需品，国家对价格卡得过死，国营商业无法进货，长期断档脱销，如白土布等纺织品，四大商场已半年多没有经营，人们要做被里，只能在个体户和集体小商店以高价去买，这种状况应尽快改变。
    吴文英听取商场经理们的意见后说，纺织工业部门在原料、能源和资金不足的情况下，要千方百计增加市场有效供给。开源节流，优化产品结构，增加适销产品，特别要搞好春节市场供应。
    目前纺织企业正在大力开发化纤新产品和多种纤维交织、混纺新产品，加快高档针织品的开发，并积极发展各类服装、时装及室内装饰用品。为了丰富夏季服装面料，正组织力量试制新型化纤仿真丝面料和服装，春末夏初将举办“夏季服装面料展销会”，请广大消费者检验纺织产品。
