	Sihanouk in Beijing Reiterates
	Vietnam Must Withdraw All Troops from Cambodia

	Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 24 (Reporters Zhang Rongdian, Zhou Shuchun) Prince Norodom Sihanouk today reiterated here, "Vietnam must withdraw all its troops from Cambodia."

	He emphasized, "Cambodia is a sovereign state, and the sovereign Cambodian people do not need Vietnamese control. We are a formal member of the United Nations and cannot be controlled and occupied by Vietnam."

	Sihanouk arrived in Beijing by plane from Paris this morning. He made these remarks when he was interviewed by reporters at the airport.

	Sihanouk said, the Cambodian issue has two aspects. One is the international aspect, which "has made some progress"; the other is the internal aspect of Cambodia, which "is currently at a stalemate, and the resolution of the problem is still very far away." "The stance of Vietnam and Hun Sen is contradictory to that of the resistance forces."

	Sihanouk told the Chinese and foreign reporters present that he does not want Vietnam to link the cessation of material aid to the resistance forces and the withdrawal of troops from Cambodia. These are two different issues. "Vietnam must withdraw its troops first, and then the resistance movement will stop accepting aid from China and other friendly countries." Sihanouk expressed that Hun Sen's proposal to establish a national reconciliation committee within the framework of the "People's Republic of Kampuchea" is unacceptable. He pointed out that the so-called "People's Republic of Kampuchea" is a creation of Vietnamese colonialists and must be disbanded. He said that the United Front of Democratic Kampuchea and the "People's Republic of Kampuchea" must be disbanded simultaneously to allow the people to decide through free elections under international supervision. Sihanouk suggested establishing a four-party government outside the framework of the illegal "People's Republic of Kampuchea."

	Sihanouk also expressed his gratitude for China's efforts in resolving the Cambodian issue and for the support given to his personal efforts in seeking a fair and reasonable resolution to the Cambodian issue.

	Prince Sihanouk and his wife were welcomed at the capital airport by Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Liu Shucai, Ambassador of Democratic Kampuchea to China Jiang Yulang, and others.

　　西哈努克在京重申   
    越南必须从柬埔寨全部撤军
    新华社北京１月２４日电（记者张荣典、周树春）诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王今天在这里重申，“越南必须从柬埔寨全部撤军”。
    他强调指出，“柬埔寨是一个主权国家，具有主权的柬埔寨人民不需要越南的控制。我们是联合国的正式成员，不能受越南的控制和占领”。
    西哈努克今天上午乘飞机从巴黎抵达北京，他在机场接受记者采访时说了这番话。
    西哈努克说，柬埔寨问题有两个方面。一是其国际方面，现在“已有一些进展”；一是柬埔寨内部方面，“现在存在僵局，距问题的解决还十分遥远”。“越南、洪森方面的立场与抵抗力量方面的立场是矛盾的。”
    西哈努克对在场的中外记者说，他不想让越南把终止向抵抗力量提供物质援助和从柬埔寨撤军这两个问题联系在一起。这是两个不同的问题。“越南必须先撤军，然后抵抗运动才停止从中国和其他友好国家接受援助”。西哈努克表示，金边政权的洪森提出的在“柬埔寨人民共和国”框架内建立一个全国和解委员会的建议是不能接受的。他指出，所谓的“柬埔寨人民共和国”是由越南殖民主义者制造的，它必须解散。他说，民柬联合政府和“柬埔寨人民共和国”必须同时解散，以便让人民通过自由选举，在国际监督下，做出决定。西哈努克建议在非法的“柬埔寨人民共和国”这个框架外，建立一个四方政府。
    西哈努克还对中国为解决柬埔寨问题所进行的努力，对中国对他本人为争取公正合理解决柬埔寨问题的努力所给予的支持表示感谢。
    西哈努克亲王和夫人抵达北京时，外交部副部长刘述卿、民主柬埔寨驻华大使江裕朗等到首都机场迎接。
