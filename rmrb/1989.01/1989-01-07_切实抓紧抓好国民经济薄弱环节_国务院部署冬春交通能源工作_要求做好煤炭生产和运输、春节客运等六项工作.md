The State Council recently issued a notice requiring all regions and departments to pay high attention to and ensure the smooth operation of transportation and energy work during the winter and spring seasons.

The notice states: In 1988, the production situation for transportation and energy nationwide was good, with coal, crude oil, electricity, and transportation all exceeding their planned targets. However, transportation and energy remain very tense and are the weak links in the national economy. To ensure the sustained and stable development of the national economy and the steady improvement of people's lives, the following tasks must be completed during the winter and spring seasons:

1. **Increase Coal Production and Transportation**: Eastern provinces and coal-deficient regions must further tap into their potential to increase production. Currently, some coal washing plants are severely underproducing, affecting the supply of coal gas to residents and the production of key steel plants. This must be rectified immediately. During the Spring Festival, coal mines should organize labor forces to ensure coal production and loading.

2. **Prioritize Coal Transportation**: The transportation department must prioritize coal transportation. The daily coal loading on railways must be guaranteed at 26,500 cars or more. Ports must ensure efficient unloading. The Ministry of Transportation must not only arrange for the shipping capacity within its system but also actively organize the shipping capacity of various provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities) to participate in coal transportation, ensuring timely loading and transportation.

   In coal transportation, priority must be given to coal for power plants, railway locomotives, key steel plants, and civilian use.

   The Northeast region and Shanxi, Shaanxi, Guizhou, and Ningxia must adopt the method of linking coal and electricity production to increase both coal production and electricity generation.

   The East China and North China regions must focus on the ports of Qinhuangdao and Shiyusuo, and the coal mines of Yangquan, Datong, and Xishan, as well as the coal transportation from local mines in Shanxi. The railway department must prioritize the allocation of empty cars to coal mines and concentrate efforts to ensure the completion of the coal transportation plan for January, striving to exceed the target.

3. **Ensure Transportation of Agricultural Production Materials and Festival Supplies**: Priority must be given to the planning and loading of grain, fertilizer, seeds, and spring plowing and sowing materials. The transportation department must actively coordinate with the commercial department to ensure festival transportation, market supply, and a good Spring Festival for the people.

4. **Ensure Spring Festival Passenger Transportation**: The transportation department must make specific arrangements, conduct passenger flow surveys, assign personnel for training in advance, and improve services. If accidents occur due to passengers carrying or mailing items containing "three types of goods" (explosives, flammables, and toxic substances), the responsibility of the illegal production and sales units must be pursued, and they must compensate for the economic losses.

5. **Promote Planned and Economical Use of Electricity**: All regions and departments must plan their annual electricity use and adhere to the principle of prioritizing key areas and planned use. Energy-saving activities must be vigorously promoted. The target of saving 20 million standard tons of coal this year must be strictly enforced from the first quarter. The Ministry of Energy must supervise electricity use, strengthen grid management; all regions and departments must strictly follow dispatching regulations, obey dispatching orders, and ensure the safe operation of the grid.

6. **Prepare for Cold Waves**: The transportation department must make advance preparations to withstand cold waves, ensuring that transportation order is not disrupted. At the same time, measures must be taken to prevent and thaw frozen goods.

　　切实抓紧抓好国民经济薄弱环节
    国务院部署冬春交通能源工作
    要求做好煤炭生产和运输、春节客运等六项工作
    据新华社北京１月６日电  国务院日前发出通知，要求各地区、各部门高度重视、切实抓紧抓好冬春交通和能源工作。
    通知指出：１９８８年全国交通、能源的生产形势是好的，煤炭、原油、电力、交通运输都超额完成了计划。但是，当前交通、能源仍然十分紧张，是国民经济的薄弱环节。为了保证国民经济持续、稳定发展和人民生活稳步提高，冬春要做好以下几项工作：
    一、抓紧煤炭生产、力争多出煤。东部省份和缺煤地区的煤矿，要进一步挖潜增产。当前有些洗煤厂严重欠产，影响居民煤气供应和重点钢厂生产，必须尽快抓上去。春节期间各煤矿要尽量组织好劳力，保证煤炭生产和装车。
    二、全力以赴抓好煤炭运输。交通运输部门要把煤炭运输摆在首位。铁路煤炭日装车要保证２６５００车以上。港口要做好卸车工作。交通部除安排好本系统轮船运力外，还要积极组织各省（区、市）运力参加运煤，保证及时装运。
    在煤炭运输中首先要保证电煤、铁路机车用煤、重点钢厂用煤和民用煤。
    东北地区及山西、陕西、贵州、宁夏等地要采取煤电挂钩的办法，多产煤、多发电。
    华东、华北地区要重点抓好秦皇岛、石臼所两港，阳泉、大同、西山三个煤矿和山西地方矿煤炭装运。铁路部门要优先保证向煤矿配送空车，集中全力抓好１月份的煤炭调运，确保煤炭运输计划的完成，力争超运。
    三、要统筹安排好农业生产物资和节日供应物资的运输。对于粮食、化肥、种子、春耕春播物资要优先安排计划，优先装运。交通运输部门要主动与商业部门联系，做好节日运输，保证市场供应，保证人民群众过好春节。
    四、抓好春节旅客运输。交通部门要做具体部署，搞好客流调查，抽调人员提前培训，搞好各项服务。如因旅客携带或行李包裹托运中夹带“三品”造成事故，要同时追究非法生产、销售单位的责任，并由其负责赔偿经济损失。
    五、坚持计划用电和节约用电。各地区、各部门用电必须做好全年的计划安排，坚持保重点和按计划用电。要大力开展节能活动，今年计划节能２０００万吨标准煤的指标，从第一季度起就要严格考核，认真抓好。能源部要做好监督用电工作，加强电网管理；各地区、各部门要严格遵守调度纪律，服从调度命令，保证电网安全运行。
    六、交通部门要提前做好抗御寒流的组织准备，保证在风雪寒流侵袭下交通运输秩序不乱。同时抓好易冻物资的防冻、解冻工作。
