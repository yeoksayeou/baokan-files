The director of the Soviet Economic Research Institute, Academician Abalkin, emphasized on January 25 during a meeting with foreign journalists that the Soviet Union's current urgent task is to address the issue of fiscal health, aiming to significantly reduce or eliminate the deficit within 2-3 years.

He said that the Soviet Union currently relies mainly on bank overdrafts and issuing currency to cover the deficit. He believes that the fundamental solution is to reduce expenditures and open up new revenue sources. Cutting out 20% of the year's construction investment in expensive projects can save over 20 billion rubles; closing loss-making enterprises or leasing them to cooperatives for operation can save another 20 billion rubles. His proposed measures to increase revenue include increasing the proportion of personal investment cooperative housing from 7% to 9% of the year's housing completion to 20%; sanatoriums and other welfare facilities can be built with residents' investments and then repaid through free use by investors for a certain number of years; some defense enterprises can convert to producing civilian goods.

In response to a question from our reporter, the academician pointed out that the main achievements of the economic reforms over the past three years are: the economy, like a heavy train that has started moving, is gradually accelerating; the economy is oriented towards improving the people's welfare; the national economy has begun a real process of intensive development, and last year's growth in material production was achieved despite a reduction in the number of workers in the material production sector and a decrease in the consumption of fuel and materials per unit. In addition to the factors of economic reform, correct economic policies and the political system reforms that have begun also played a role in this regard.

　　苏经济研究所所长谈经济面临的迫切问题    
    减少或消灭赤字使财政健康化
    新华社莫斯科电（记者盛世良）苏联经济研究所所长阿巴尔金院士１月２５日在会见外国记者时强调指出，苏联经济当前迫切要解决财政状况健康化问题，力争２—３年内大幅度减少或消灭赤字。
    他说，苏联目前主要靠银行透支和发行货币来补上赤字。他认为，根本办法是减少开支和开辟财源。砍去占当年基建投资２０％的昂贵工程，可省出２００多亿卢布；关闭亏损企业或将其租赁给合作社经营，又可省出２００亿卢布。他提出的开源措施有，把占当年住房竣工量７％至９％的个人集资合作建房的比重增加到２０％；休养所等福利设施可由居民投资建造，然后以投资者免费使用若干年的方式偿还投资；部分军工企业转产民用品。
    这位院士在回答本社记者提问时指出，３年多经济改革取得的主要成果是，经济像一列已经启动的沉重的火车，渐渐加速发展；经济面向提高人民福利水平；国民经济开始了现实的集约化进程，去年物质生产的增长是在减少物质生产部门职工、降低燃料和材料单位消耗的情况下实现的。除了经济改革因素外，正确的经济政策和已经起步的政治体制改革也在这方面发挥了作用。
