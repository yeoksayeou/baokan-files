A series of measures to stabilize prices and finance have achieved results. The balance of urban and rural savings deposits has reached nearly 38 billion yuan. Residents hold approximately 17 billion yuan in cash that needs to be guided and transformed.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 11th, (Reporter Ding Jianming) The reporter learned from the People's Bank of China that last year, the growth of urban and rural savings deposits in China remained at a relatively high level. By the end of last year, the balance of national urban and rural savings deposits had reached 37.98 billion yuan, an increase of 7.246 billion yuan from the previous year-end. Among these, the balance of urban savings deposits reached 26.587 billion yuan, an increase of 5.911 billion yuan from the previous year-end.

Last year, due to the relatively obvious inflation in the country, residents' panic over price increases intensified, and banks were hit by several nationwide waves of residents withdrawing deposits and buying goods. In the first eight months, the increase in urban and rural savings deposits was relatively small, and some months even saw a rare decrease in savings deposits since the founding of the nation.

Starting from September, the Party Central Committee and the State Council took a series of measures to stabilize prices and finance. The market began to stabilize relatively, and residents' psychological expectations weakened to some extent. At the same time, banks successively raised deposit interest rates, and starting from September 10th, they also launched savings deposits with a term of more than three years that maintain value. In addition, various banks across the country adopted various methods to attract deposits, such as savings with physical prizes. In the latter months, bank savings deposits increased significantly.

Last year, although the growth of urban and rural savings deposits in China was relatively fast, the growth rate still decreased by 13.8 percentage points compared to the previous year. In particular, rural savings increased by only 1.335 billion yuan throughout the year, which was 1.08 billion yuan less than the previous year, and the growth rate of savings deposits decreased by 18 percentage points compared to the previous year. According to analysis, the slow growth of rural savings last year was not only due to the significant increase in the prices of agricultural production materials and the corresponding increase in farmers' expenditures but also related to the fact that there are more collective and individual industrial and commercial households in rural areas, cash settlements are more common, and various forms of fundraising in rural areas have increased due to tight monetary policy.

It is understood that at present, urban and rural residents in China still hold approximately 17 billion yuan in cash. This part of the currency exerts tremendous pressure on the consumer goods market in China and needs to be guided and transformed through savings and other means.

　　一系列稳定物价和金融措施取得成效
    城乡储蓄存款余额近３８００亿元
    居民手中约有１７００亿元现金需要引导和转化
    据新华社北京１月１１日电  （记者丁坚铭）记者从中国人民银行了解到，去年我国城乡储蓄存款增长仍保持较高势头。截止到去年底，全国城乡储蓄存款余额已达３７９８亿元，储蓄存款比上年末增加了７２４．６亿元，其中城镇储蓄存款余额达２６５８．７亿元，储蓄存款比上年末增加５９１．１亿元。
    去年，由于国内出现了较明显的通货膨胀，居民对物价上涨的恐慌心理加剧，银行因而遭受到数次全国性的居民挤兑存款抢购商品风潮的冲击。前８个月，城乡储蓄存款增加较少，个别月份甚至出现了建国以来少见的储蓄存款余额下降的情况。
    进入９月份以后，党中央、国务院采取了一系列稳定物价、稳定金融的措施，市场开始相对稳定，居民的心理预期有所减弱；与此同时，银行相继提高了存款利率，９月１０日起又开办了３年以上保值储蓄业务，再加上各地银行采取了实物有奖储蓄等多种形式吸储办法，后几个月银行储蓄存款有较大幅度增长。
    去年，我国城乡储蓄存款虽然增长较快，但与上年相比，增长幅度仍下降了１３．８个百分点，特别是农村储蓄去年全年仅增加１３３．５亿元，比上年少增加１０８亿元，储蓄存款余额增长幅度比上年降低了１８个百分点。据分析，去年农村储蓄增长缓慢除了农业生产资料价格上涨幅度较大，农民支出相应增加以外，还与农村集体、个体工商户较多，使用现金结算较普遍及由于银根紧缩，农村各种形式的集资增加较多等因素有关。
    据了解，目前我国城乡居民手中大约还有１７００亿元的手持现金，这部分货币对我国消费品市场形成了巨大压力，需要通过储蓄等方式加以引导和转化。
