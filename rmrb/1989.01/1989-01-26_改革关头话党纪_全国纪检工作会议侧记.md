As 1989 begins, the reform faces a critical juncture.

In this crucial year of rectification, adjustment, and deepening reform, how can we effectively strengthen and improve party discipline and party conduct? This question was the focus of discussions at the ongoing National Conference on Discipline Inspection Work. Delegates from the central and local discipline inspection systems gathered to discuss, debate, and reflect on this issue.

"At this critical moment of reform, we must strengthen party discipline and party conduct, strictly investigate and punish party discipline violations, and uphold party discipline," said Wang Huasheng, Secretary of the Chongqing Municipal Discipline Inspection Commission in Sichuan Province. "Our party is the ruling party. If we do not maintain strict discipline within our own ranks, we will not be able to enforce administrative orders, and the implementation of the entire reform plan will be obstructed. Now, with the rectification and adjustment, the central authorities have proposed 'five-pronged comprehensive governance.' In my view, disciplinary measures are a key link." It is understood that after the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, local discipline inspection commissions, in collaboration with other supervisory and law enforcement departments, have focused on investigating and punishing a number of cases involving bribery, extortion, abuse of power, and illegal trading, which have played a role in clearing obstacles for the rectification and adjustment work.

Delegates generally noted a significant fact: currently, economic cases account for a considerable proportion of various party discipline violations, and bribery cases account for about 60% of economic cases. This shows that the issue of clean governance in party and government organs and among party leaders directly affects the overall situation of rectification, adjustment, and deepening reform. Wang Zongchun, Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission, said, "Corruption is one of the causes of disorder in the economic environment and economic order. Conversely, a disordered economic environment and economic order is a breeding ground for corruption. Therefore, we must closely link the promotion of clean governance, especially disciplinary education, with rectification and adjustment." He also introduced that the central authorities have given Guangdong some special policies and flexible measures, and Guangdong has taken the lead in the steps of reform and opening up. However, we have not only focused on material civilization and neglected spiritual civilization, or only focused on reform and introduction and forgotten about clean governance and resistance. In recent years, we have strengthened and deepened disciplinary education, effectively curbing the spread of unhealthy tendencies. In the recent financial, tax, and price inspections in Guangdong, self-reported discipline violations were more serious and voluntary than in previous inspections. For example, out of 36 departments, bureaus, and corporations under the provincial government, 33 discipline violations were self-reported, amounting to 32.3 million yuan. In addition, the long-standing practice of extravagant banquets in Guangdong has been initially curbed. According to statistics, the entertainment expenses of most units in the province have been reduced by one-third, and some departments have reduced them by 70%. The phenomenon of "constant firecrackers, hotels and restaurants queuing up in long lines, and invitations being sent back and forth" has been greatly reduced.

Cao Kemin, Secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission, raised a sharp question: "Why, in the past two years, have the people's pockets been full, but their complaints and grievances have not decreased?" He said that we should acknowledge that reform is an unprecedented undertaking, and there will be mistakes and detours. Most people can understand this; but what they are most opposed to and have the most complaints about is not the problems caused by the reform itself, but the harm caused to the reform, society, and the people by some party members and cadres due to scattered thoughts, lax discipline, corrupt governance, and arbitrary actions. Whether it is price gouging or illegal trading, it appears to be an economic problem, but it will affect party morale and public sentiment, thus creating a serious political problem. If party discipline is not taken seriously, cases that should be investigated are not investigated, issues that should be handled are not handled, and problems that should be corrected are not corrected, the overall situation will be out of control, people's hearts will be scattered, and the great cause of reform will be in vain.

It is reported that after the separation of party and government functions, administrative supervision departments have been established in various places, and the discipline inspection and supervision departments have basically clarified their division of responsibilities. More than 20 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities have established a joint conference system for supervisory and law enforcement departments. This is a welcome phenomenon in the development of China's democratic and legal system, but some people in society have a vague understanding, thinking that since the supervision agencies have been established, the discipline inspection agencies have "nothing to do." Bai Shi, Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission, does not agree with this view. He believes that at present, the discipline inspection agencies should play a greater role in macro guidance and supervision coordination. He said, before the 13th Party Congress, the discipline inspection commissions, under the command of the central authorities, were mainly responsible for combating economic crimes and did some work that belonged to the judicial departments; now, each has its own responsibilities, each does its own job, and they cooperate and support each other. The party's discipline inspection agencies are not always engaged in specific case handling and can free up their hands to conduct in-depth investigations and research, improve systems and regulations, oversee the entire supervision and discipline enforcement, and concentrate on solving major problems with a tendency.

Xu Fa, Secretary of the Harbin Municipal Discipline Inspection Commission in Heilongjiang Province, also mentioned that discipline inspection work should not be passive in "blocking, stopping, and investigating." He said, "Counting up, in these years we have stopped dozens of 'winds,' but the results are that they are stopped but not stopped; we have also investigated many old cases, but after the fact, the actual educational significance is not great. In the past two years, Harbin City has focused on the foresight and proactive prevention of discipline inspection work, strengthened the information feedback system, changed the 'blind, deaf, and mute' state, and solved emerging problems as soon as they are discovered, eliminating bad tendencies and discipline violations in the bud, achieving good results in preventing problems before they occur." Yu Guirong, Secretary of the Dalian Municipal Discipline Inspection Commission in Liaoning Province, also agreed, saying that strengthening proactive supervision can make a batch of party members and cadres not make mistakes or make fewer mistakes, which is itself an achievement, and it is more meaningful than investigating after the case has occurred.

During the conference, the reporter interviewed Wang Dezheng, a member of the Standing Committee of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission and Secretary-General, who said: "The significance of this conference has been mentioned by Comrades Qiao Shi and Chen Zuolin. It can be said that it was convened in response to the unanimous call from top to bottom to strengthen discipline. The rectification and adjustment work is the background of this conference. Discipline inspection work should serve the grand goal of reform and opening up; otherwise, it will not gain the support of the party and the people. The situation reminds us: it is imperative and urgent to uphold party discipline and strengthen discipline inspection work."

　　改革关头话党纪
    ——全国纪检工作会议侧记
    本报记者  陈维伟
    步入１９８９年，改革面临严峻关头。
    在治理、整顿、全面深化改革的关键一年里，党风党纪工作如何切实抓紧抓好？正在举行的全国纪检工作会议上，来自中央和各地纪检系统的与会者在研讨，在谈论，在思索……
    “越是改革的关键时刻，越要加强党风党纪建设，严格查处党内违纪案件，严明党的纪律。”四川省重庆市纪委书记王华生说：“我们的党是执政党，如果自身纪律不严，就无法做到令行政通，整个改革计划的贯彻就会受阻。现在搞治理整顿，中央提出‘五管齐下，综合治理’，在我看，纪律手段是关键一环。”据了解，三中全会后，各地纪委会同其它监督执法部门，重点查处了一批贪污受贿、敲诈勒索、弄权渎职、非法倒卖等违法乱纪案件，对治理整顿工作起到清除路障的作用。
    与会者普遍注意到这样一个事实：目前，党内各类违纪案件中经济案件占相当大的比例，而贪污受贿案件又占经济案件的６０％左右。由此可以看出，党政机关和党员领导干部的廉政问题抓得怎样，会直接影响治理、整顿、深化改革的全局。广东省纪委书记王宗春说：“不廉洁是经济环境和经济秩序混乱的原因之一，反过来讲，经济环境和经济秩序混乱又是产生腐败现象的温床。因此，要把开展廉政教育特别是纪律教育同治理、整顿紧密结合起来。”他还介绍说，中央给了广东一些特殊政策、灵活措施，在改革开放的步骤上也比其它省份先行一步。但我们没有只顾抓物质文明，丢了精神文明，或只抓改革和引进，忘了廉政和抵制，特别是近年来加强和深化纪律教育，有效抑制了不正之风的泛滥和蔓延。广东省在最近开展的财务、税收、物价大检查中，自查自报违纪问题比近几年历次大检查都认真、自觉。如省直３６个厅、局、总公司自查自报中，有３３个违纪问题，金额达３２３０万元。另外，广东盛行多时的吃喝风现在也初步被遏制。据统计，全省大部分单位招待费用普遍减少１／３，一些部门减少７０％，以往那种“成天鞭炮齐鸣，宾馆饭店排队成龙，请柬你送我送他也送”的现象大大减少了。
    江苏省纪委书记曹克明提出一个尖锐问题：“为什么这两年老百姓钱袋鼓了，反而牢骚不减、怨声不断？”他说，应该承认，改革是前所未有的事业，会有失误，也会走弯路，大多数群众对这一点是能够体谅的；但他们最反感的、最有意见的，恰恰并不是改革本身造成的问题，而是某些党员干部由于思想涣散，纪律松弛，为政不廉，各行其是，给改革、给社会、给群众带来的危害。哄抬物价也罢，倒买倒卖也罢，表面看是经济问题，但它会影响到党心、民心，这就造成严重的政治问题。不严肃党纪，该查的不查，该处理的不处理，该纠正的不纠正，全局就会失控，人心就会涣散，改革大业就会付诸东流。
    据悉，党政职能分开以后，各地行政监察部门相继成立，纪检与监察等监督执法部门在职责上有了基本明确的分工，２０多个省、区、市还建立了监督执法部门的联席会议制度。这是我国民主法制建设发展的一个可喜现象，但社会上也由此产生一些模糊认识，认为既然成立了监察机构，纪检机关就“无事可做”了。河北省纪委书记白石不这么看，他认为，当前，纪检机关应当在宏观指导、监督协调方面发挥更大的作用。他说，十三大以前，纪委受中央之命主管打击经济犯罪活动，做了一些属于司法部门的部分工作；现在是各负其责，各司其职，相互协作，相互支持。党的纪检机关不是成天陷入具体办案之中，可以腾出手来，搞深层次调查研究，抓制度规章健全，统揽监督执纪全局，集中精力解决带有倾向性的重大问题。
    黑龙江省哈尔滨市纪委书记徐发还谈到，纪检工作不能陷入被动的“堵、刹、查”，要注意监督的超前性。他说，数一数，这些年我们前前后后刹了二三十股“风”，结果是屡刹不止；我们还查了不少陈年老案，但事过境迁，事后堵洞，实际教育意义也不大。近两年，哈尔滨市抓了纪检工作的超前性和主动预防，强化信息反馈系统，改变“盲、聋、哑”状态，发现苗头性问题即着手解决，把歪风和违纪问题消灭在萌芽状态中，收到防患于未然的良好效果。辽宁省大连市纪委书记于桂荣也有同感，她认为，抓好超前监督，可以使一批党员干部不犯错误或少犯错误，这本身也是成绩，而且比案子发生了再查更有意义。
    会议间隙，记者采访了中纪委常委、秘书长王德瑛，他说：“这次会议的意义，乔石同志和陈作霖同志都讲了，可以说，它是在上上下下一致要求加强纪律的呼声中召开的，治理整顿工作是这次会议的大背景。纪检工作要为改革开放的大目标服务，否则就得不到党内外的支持。形势告诫我们：严肃党的纪律，加强纪检工作，势在必行，刻不容缓。”
