	While some domestic newspapers and publishing departments are struggling with the poor performance of imported electronic typesetting systems, the Hanzi laser typesetting system jointly developed by Weifang Computer Company and Peking University and produced by the company has been performing exceptionally well in various units, receiving widespread praise and acclaim.

	In recent years, China's high-tech enterprises have developed rapidly. Some companies have achieved significant success in the circulation sector by importing advanced foreign products and selling them in the domestic market. However, Weifang Computer Company chose the path of production from the outset. They selected the best for introduction, accelerated digestion, and based on this, boldly and pragmatically developed and innovated. Over six years, they invested $10 million, introduced more than 20 advanced technologies and products, and successively developed more than a dozen products with international standards of the 1980s. The company's profits have increased threefold.

	The predecessor of Weifang Computer Company was a small computer factory with only about 300 people. In 1982, the company's leadership began to look abroad. After comparing several types of microcomputers, they selected and introduced a product from an American computer company. The company organized technical personnel to digest the technology, and by the end of the year, they had entered mass production, generating a profit of 8.7 million yuan. By 1984, through further development and modification, they produced the DJS-033 microcomputer, which passed the appraisal with over 80% domestic content, becoming the first appraised microcomputer in China. Due to its high domestic content, it saved the country $7.8 million in foreign exchange over four years.

	The company then introduced wireless telephone and program-controlled exchange technologies. Based on these, they developed a series of products with high domestic content, generating profits of over 10 million yuan annually.

	The Hanzi laser typesetting system is internationally recognized as a "hard nut to crack." Weifang Computer Company began joint research with Peking University in the late 1970s, and in 1985, the system passed the national appraisal. Its "main technical indicators reached international advanced levels," and "some technologies are at the world's leading level." It is now used in more than 60 publishing houses, newspapers, printing plants, and government agencies, with good feedback. In some aspects, it is clearly superior to imported Hanzi typesetting systems. Over the past six years, Weifang Computer Company has developed three major series of products: computers, communication technology, and Hanzi information processing technology. Among these, nine main products have won provincial-level or higher quality product awards. This small factory, which had fewer than 300 people six years ago, has now entered the ranks of China's top 10 computer companies. Currently, Weifang Computer Company's more than 20 main products all use international standards, obtaining the "passport" to the international market. The Hanzi laser typesetting system was well-received when it was exhibited in Japan and Singapore in 1985 and 1986. Last year, in the international tender for Hanzi laser typesetting systems held by the World Bank to improve China's educational printing standards, it won the bid with its superior price and quality, defeating several Japanese and British companies.

　　择优引进　加速消化　厂校挂钩
    潍坊计算机公司开发创新取得成果
    本报讯  当国内一些报社、出版部门为从国外引进的电子照排系统使用效果不佳而大伤脑筋时，潍坊计算机公司和北京大学共同研究、由该公司生产的汉字激光照排系统却在一些单位大显身手，受到广泛的好评和称赞。
    我国高技术企业近年来发展迅速，一些企业从国外引进先进产品转卖国内市场，在流通领域获得巨大成功。而潍坊计算机公司一开始就选择了生产这一条道路。他们择优引进、加速消化，在此基础上大胆而又踏实地开发和创新。６年来，共投资１００万美元，引进先进技术和产品２０多项，相继开发出十几种具有国际８０年代水平的产品，企业利润翻了３番。
    潍坊计算机公司前身是个仅有３００多人的计算机小厂。１９８２年，公司领导开始把目光投向国外。他们在比较了七八种微型机以后，选中并引进了美国一家电脑公司的产品，公司组织科技人员进行消化，当年就投入批量生产，创利润８７万元。到１９８４年，通过进一步开发、改造，他们生产出了ＤＪＳ—０３３型微机，以８０％以上的国产化程度通过了鉴定，成为我国第一个鉴定的微机品种，并由于国产化程度高，４年为国家节约了７８０万美元外汇。
    公司接着又引进了无线电话机和程控交换机等技术。并以此为基础开发出一批国产化程度较高的系列产品，每年创利上百万元。
    汉字激光照排系统，是国际上公认的“硬骨头”。潍坊计算机公司从７０年代后期即与北大进行联合研制，１９８５年该系统通过国家鉴定。其“主要技术指标达到国际先进水平”，“某些技术居世界领先地位”。现已在６０多家出版社、报社、印刷厂和机关使用，反应良好，某些方面明显优于从国外引进的汉字照排系统。６年来，潍坊计算机公司先后开发出计算机、通讯技术和汉字信息处理技术等３大系列产品，其中９种主要产品获省级以上优质产品奖。这个６年前只有不足３００人的小厂，现在已进入我国１０大计算机企业的行列。现在，潍坊计算机公司２０多种主要产品已全部采用国际标准，拿到了通向国际市场的“通行证”。汉字激光照排系统１９８５、１９８６年在日本、新加坡参展时，颇受欢迎。去年在世界银行为改善我国教育印刷水平而举行的汉字激光照排系统国际招标中，以价廉质优战胜日本和英国几家公司，一举中标。
