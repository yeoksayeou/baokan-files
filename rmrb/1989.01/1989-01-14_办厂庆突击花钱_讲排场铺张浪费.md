In September 1988, Lanjiang Smelting Plant in our city held a 30th anniversary celebration that involved sudden large spending and extravagant waste, spending a large sum of money, which caused strong reactions from the public.

On September 10, Lanjiang Smelting Plant held a celebration for its 30th anniversary. Nearly 100 guests from various places attended. These guests generally stayed in rooms costing 30 to 40 yuan per day and dined on high-end banquets. As soon as the celebration ended, the banquet began. The banquet featured high-end cigarettes like Marlboro, famous liquors like Maotai and Wuliangye, and cold and hot dishes such as soft-shelled turtles, hairy crabs, ham, and large yellowfish, totaling more than 20 dishes. After the banquet, each guest received a gift bag (usually a pressure cooker). That day, 32 tables were set for lunch and more than 20 tables for dinner, with each table costing around 200 to 300 yuan, and some tables costing as much as 400 yuan.

For this anniversary, Lanjiang Smelting Plant built a large "waterfront restaurant" that can accommodate 28 tables. The restaurant is equipped with air conditioning and has luxurious decorations, reportedly costing over 700,000 yuan. During the anniversary, the plant specially invited the provincial "Little Plum Blossom" troupe with 79 members to perform 5 shows over 4 days. After each performance, the actors received a large red envelope. The daily food standard for the troupe members was 15 yuan per person, plus accommodation and transportation, totaling about 200,000 yuan in expenses.

During the preparation for the 30th anniversary celebration, Lanjiang Smelting Plant also specially printed a factory history album in Hong Kong, filmed a set of television footage, gave each employee a pressure cooker, a ventilator, a 40-yuan shopping voucher, as well as eggs and alcohol, spending tens of millions of yuan.

As managers of state-owned enterprises, such spending is worth pondering. It is suggested that relevant departments pay high attention to this issue, conduct an audit, and put an end to this trend.

　　办厂庆突击花钱
  　讲排场铺张浪费
    １９８８年９月，我市兰江冶炼厂搞了一次突击花钱、铺张浪费的３０周年厂庆，花去一大笔钱，群众反映十分强烈。
    ９月１０日，兰江冶炼厂召开建厂３０周年庆祝大会，各地来宾近百人。这些宾客一般住的是三四十元一天的房间，吃的是较高档的酒席。庆祝大会一结束，宴会开场。宴会上，有万宝路等高级香烟，有茅台、五粮液等名酒，有甲鱼、毛蟹、火腿、大黄鱼等冷盘热菜２０多种。宴会结束，送给每人礼物一袋（一般是高压锅一只）。这天的宴席午餐摆了３２桌，晚餐摆了２０多桌，每桌开支二三百元左右，有的一桌酒席不少于４００元。
    为了这次厂庆，兰江冶炼厂新建了一座可摆２８桌酒席的大型“水上餐厅”。餐厅安有空调，装潢豪华，据说花了７０多万元。厂庆期间，厂里还特地请来省“小百花”剧团７９人，４天演了５场戏，每演完一场戏，送给演员一个大红包。招待剧团成员每天的伙食标准人均１５元，加上住宿、迎来送去，开支约２万元。
    在准备建厂３０周年庆祝活动过程中，兰江冶炼厂还专门从香港彩印了厂史画册，拍摄电视镜头一组，发给每个职工高压锅一只、换气扇１台、４０元购物券，还有鸡蛋、酒若干，花去人民币几十万元。
    作为国家企业的经营者，如此花钱，是值得深思的。建议有关部门对这一问题高度重视，予以审计，以煞此风。
