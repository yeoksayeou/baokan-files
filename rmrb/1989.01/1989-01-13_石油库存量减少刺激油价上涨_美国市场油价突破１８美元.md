In the New York Mercantile Exchange, today the price of American standard crude oil—West Texas Intermediate—February futures rose to $18.15 per barrel, surpassing $18 for the first time since mid-February of last year.

The American Petroleum Institute reported on January 10th that U.S. oil stockpiles decreased by 5.5 million barrels last week, leaving only 329 million barrels. This is the direct cause of today's price increase of $0.45 per barrel.

Since last autumn, the North Sea oil fields in the UK have been experiencing technical issues, resulting in a daily reduction of 500,000 barrels. This situation is expected to continue until at least February of this year, also contributing to the rise in oil prices.

Oil analysts here say that since the beginning of this year, OPEC's daily oil production has been approximately 19 million barrels, close to the OPEC production limit of 18.5 million barrels agreed upon in the agreement. OPEC member states have largely adhered to the agreement, significantly reducing production, which plays a decisive role in stabilizing the oil market.

　　石油库存量减少刺激油价上涨
    美国市场油价突破１８美元
    本报纽约１月１１日电  记者刘开宸报道：在纽约商品交易所里，今天美国标准原油——西得克萨斯中质油２月份期货每桶价涨到１８．１５美元，自去年２月中旬以来第一次突破１８美元。
    美国石油研究所１０日发表的报告说，美国石油库存上周又减少５５０万桶，只剩３．２９亿桶。这是刺激今天油价每桶上涨０．４５美元的直接原因。
    英国北海油田从去年秋天起因技术事故每天减产５０万桶，这种状况至少还要延续到今年２月。这对油价上升也有一定影响。
    此间石油分析家说，今年初以来，欧佩克每天的油产量约为１９００万桶，接近欧佩克限产协议１８５０万桶的数字。欧佩克国家基本上遵守协议，大幅度减产，对稳定石油市场起着决定性的作用。
