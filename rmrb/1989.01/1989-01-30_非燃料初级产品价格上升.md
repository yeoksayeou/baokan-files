According to statistics released by the World Bank on the 27th, the prices of non-fuel primary products in the world in 1988 rose by an average of 19.9 percent compared to 1987.

During this period, due to strong industrial demand, the prices of metals and mineral products rose by nearly 25 percent; grain prices rose by 27 percent due to the impact of droughts; while cotton prices fell by 18.2 percent due to large supply and decreased demand.

Among various primary products, the price of nickel saw the largest increase. The average price of nickel on the London Metal Exchange last year reached $13,778.3 per ton, an increase of over 180 percent from the previous year.

　　非燃料初级产品价格上升
    据世界银行二十七日公布的统计数字，一九八八年，世界非燃料初级产品的价格比一九八七年平均上升了百分之十九点九。
    在此期间，由于工业需求旺盛，金属和矿产品的价格上升了近百分之二十五；谷物价格因旱灾影响上升了百分之二十七；而棉花则由于供应量大、需求下降，价格下降了百分之十八点二。
    在各类初级产品中，价格上升幅度最大的是镍。伦敦金属市场上的镍价去年平均达每吨一万三千七百七十八点三美元，比上一年上升百分之一百八十以上。
