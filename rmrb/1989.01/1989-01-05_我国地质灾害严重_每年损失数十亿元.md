China is a country severely affected by geological disasters. In particular, landslides, collapses, and mudflows in mountainous areas cause tens of billions of yuan in economic losses each year. This information was revealed at the first national conference on geological disaster prevention and control, jointly held by the State Science and Technology Commission and the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources today.

According to incomplete statistics, the engineering costs for addressing railway traffic disasters caused by landslides and collapses alone exceed 10 billion yuan. Cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuxi, Cangzhou, Tai'an, and Wuchang have experienced severe ground subsidence and collapses due to excessive groundwater extraction, directly impacting economic development and the safety of people's lives and property in these regions. Water and soil erosion in plateau and hilly areas, as well as desertification in the western Gobi regions, have all affected economic and social development to varying degrees.

　　我国地质灾害严重
    每年损失数十亿元
    据新华社北京１月４日电  （《中国地质报》记者何建明、宋天祥）我国是一个地质灾害较为严重的国家，特别是山区的崩塌、滑坡、泥石流的灾害，每年给国家造成数十亿的经济损失。这是记者从国家科委和地矿部今天联合召开的首次全国地质灾害防治工作会议上获悉的。
    据不完全统计，仅因整治崩塌、滑坡造成的铁路交通灾害工程费就达１０亿元以上。上海、天津、无锡、沧州、泰安、武昌等城市曾因过量开采地下水出现过严重的地面下沉和陷塌，直接影响了这些地区的经济发展和人民生命财产安全。高原和丘陵地区的水土流失、西部戈壁沙漠地区的沙化等地质灾害都不同程度地影响着这些地区的经济和社会的发展。
