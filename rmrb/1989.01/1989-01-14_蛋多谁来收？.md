	Our county is famous nationwide for its abundance of chickens and eggs. Currently, there are 1.6 million laying hens, producing approximately 50,000 kilograms of fresh eggs daily. However, recently, selling eggs has become a challenge for the people. Although the county has instructed the food company and the foreign trade company to strive to purchase more, many collection points often close for days due to lack of funds, insufficient egg crates, and inadequate refrigeration equipment. People wait all day, but it is difficult to sell the fresh eggs. Our county is not far from Xi'an and Xianyang. In the past, individual business operators would purchase some eggs, but now, due to high transportation costs and low profits, the number of operators is decreasing, and the daily sales volume is only around 5,000 kilograms. It is estimated that our county has nearly 40,000 kilograms of fresh eggs that need to be sold urgently. The attached picture shows the scene of villagers in Anjia Village, Yuchu Township, waiting to sell their eggs.

### 蛋多谁来收？

　　蛋多谁来收？
    我县素以鸡多蛋多而闻名全国，全县现有１６０万只蛋鸡，每天约有５万公斤鲜蛋上市。可是近来，群众卖蛋陷入困境。县里虽要求县食品公司、外贸公司力争多收购，但许多收购点常因资金短缺、蛋箱不足和缺乏冷藏设备，一关门就是几天。群众整日等候，鲜蛋很难脱手。我县距西安、咸阳不远，以往个体经营户收购一些，如今因运价高，获利少，经营的人日渐减少，日运销量不过５０００多公斤。估计我县每天有近４万公斤鲜蛋急待外销。图为我县榆楚乡安家村群众待售鸡蛋的情景。
