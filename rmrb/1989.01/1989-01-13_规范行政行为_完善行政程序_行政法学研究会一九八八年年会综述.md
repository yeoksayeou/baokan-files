The annual meeting of the China Law Society's Administrative Law Research Association was recently held in Taiyuan. The meeting conducted an in-depth discussion on issues related to standardizing administrative behavior and improving administrative procedures.

Administrative law enforcement is a concept that has been quite popular in recent years, and it has had a significant impact on the administrative law theoretical system and administrative practice. Therefore, it has attracted the attention of the attendees. During the discussion, some participants believed that it refers to the activities of state administrative organs in enforcing the Constitution, laws, administrative regulations, and administrative rules. Any action taken by administrative organs in accordance with the law is administrative law enforcement. In this sense, administrative law enforcement is administrative behavior. However, some participants with different views believed that administrative law enforcement is not a scientific concept; it is merely a term used in daily language and has no scientific value. There is also an opinion that administrative law enforcement does not generally refer to the system of administrative organs enforcing laws, but rather to the specific behavior of certain administrative organs in adjudicating administrative disputes and related civil disputes in accordance with the law, similar to the administrative courts in Britain and the independent administrative agencies in the United States. Our country's administrative law enforcement can be considered as the embryonic form of administrative adjudication. The main problems in current administrative law enforcement are: lack of necessary conditions for enforcement and lack of coercive enforcement power; there are many instances of improper administration and infringement of citizens' legal rights. To address this, some suggestions were made: first, establish independent law enforcement agencies; second, strengthen authorization legislation, and the scope of authorization should be clear; third, strengthen procedural legislation, and strictly regulate administrative law enforcement procedures; fourth, improve administrative remedies to provide adequate relief for the parties involved; fifth, further strengthen the construction of the administrative law enforcement team. Some participants also made suggestions on establishing an administrative law enforcement system, proposing to implement a system of separation of administrative supervision and administrative penalties, where administrative organs only have the right to supervise and prosecute the penalized parties, but the penalty power should be exercised by specially established adjudicatory bodies with judicial characteristics.

In government behavior, administrative penalties are an area with many current problems. The main problems are: first, unclear subjects, or the arbitrary expansion of administrative penalty subjects; second, self-established penalty grounds, and even no grounds; third, excessive penalty amounts, leading to improper discretion within the scope of discretion; fourth, unclear penalty procedures and forms; fifth, multiple penalties for a single offense or failure to penalize when appropriate; sixth, the connection with administrative litigation is not entirely reasonable. To overcome these drawbacks, some participants pointed out that administrative penalties should follow the following principles: first, the principle of penalties based on grounds, including legal grounds and factual grounds; second, the principle of reasonable penalties; third, the principle of no double penalties for a single offense; fourth, the principle of no penalties without remedies. Closely related to the issue of administrative penalties is the discretionary power of administrative organs. Some participants believe that to prevent administrative organs from abusing their discretionary power in administrative penalties and other areas, it is necessary to establish judicial supervision and control over discretionary power.

The issue of administrative procedures has recently attracted increasing attention, not only because of the global trend towards codification of administrative procedures, but also because of the lack of administrative procedure law in our country's administrative law, and more importantly, because administrative law cannot solve practical problems without administrative procedures. The attendees believed that it is urgently necessary for our country to formulate an administrative procedure law separate from the Administrative Litigation Law and substantive administrative law. Its main contents include: first, administrative transparency; second, meeting system; third, hearing system; fourth, approval system; fifth, work handover system; sixth, procedural regulations for administrative legislation, penalties, compulsory enforcement, administrative review, etc. However, some people believe that it is not significant to distinguish between substantive law and procedural law in administrative law. Administrative law should mainly be procedural law because administrative law mainly functions through procedures. For example, the establishment of administrative organs, the types of administrative powers, and other substantive law contents are factual issues. They exist independently of legal regulations, and moreover, these substantive contents can only function through procedures. Therefore, administrative law should mainly study procedural issues.

The meeting also discussed issues such as administrative compulsory enforcement and administrative legislation.

　　规范行政行为　完善行政程序
    ——行政法学研究会一九八八年年会综述
    中国法学会行政法学研究会１９８８年年会，前不久在太原市召开。会议就有关如何规范行政行为、完善行政程序问题进行了较为深入的讨论。
    行政执法是近年来颇为流行的概念，它对行政法理论体系和行政实践有很大影响，因而引起与会者的关注。在讨论中，有的同志认为它是指国家行政机关执行宪法、法律、行政法规及行政规章的活动，凡是行政机关依法采取的行为就是行政执法。从这一意义上说，行政执法就是行政行为；而有些持不同意见的同志认为行政执法不是一个科学概念，它不过是人们的日常用语，并无科学价值；还有一种意见认为，行政执法不是泛指行政机关执行法律的制度，而是指特定的行政机关依法裁决行政纠纷和有关民事纠纷的行为，即类似于英国的行政裁判所、美国的独立管理机构的准司法行为。我国的行政执法可以认为是行政裁判的雏形。在当前的行政执法中存在的问题主要是：缺乏执法必备的条件，缺乏强制执行的权力；不当行政、侵犯公民合法权益的现象大量存在。对此，有人建议：一是建立独立的执法机构；二是加强授权立法，且授权范围要明确；三是加强程序立法，对行政执法程序要作出严格规定；四是行政救济手段要加以完善，为相对人提供充分的救济；五是要进一步加强行政执法队伍建设。还有的同志对建立行政执法体制问题提出了建议，认为应实行行政监控和行政处罚的分立制度，即行政机关只享有对被处罚人的监督和控诉权，但处罚权应当由特别设立的具有司法性质的专门裁决机构行使。
    在政府行为中，行政处罚是当前存在问题较多的领域。主要问题有：一是主体不明确，或行政处罚主体被随意扩大；二是自立处罚依据，甚至没有依据；三是处罚幅度过大，造成在自由裁量权范围内的不当；四是处罚的程序和形式规定不明确；五是一事多罚或当罚不罚；六是与行政诉讼的衔接也不尽合理。为克服上述弊端，有的同志指出行政处罚应遵循以下原则：一是处罚有据原则，包括法律依据和事实依据；二是处罚合理原则；三是一事不得重罚原则；四是无救济便无处罚原则。与行政处罚问题密切相联系的是行政机关的自由裁量权。有同志认为，为了防止行政机关在行政处罚等方面滥用自由裁量权，必须建立对自由裁量权的司法监督和控制。
    行政程序问题近来已日益引起人们的重视，这不仅是因为世界性的行政程序法典化的趋势，也不仅是因为我国行政法中行政程序法的缺失，更主要的是因为行政法要想解决实际问题就一刻也不能离开行政程序。与会者认为，当前我国急需制定一部区别于行政诉讼法和行政实体法的行政程序法，它的主要内容包括：一是行政公开化；二是会议制度；三是听证制度；四是审批制度；五是工作交接制度；六是行政立法、处罚、强制执行、行政复议等程序规定。但也有人认为，在行政法上划分实体法和程序法意义不大，行政法主要应当是程序法，因为行政法主要通过程序起作用，诸如行政机关的设置、行政权力的种类等实体法内容都是事实问题，它不因法律规定而存在，况且这些实体内容只有通过程序才能起作用。所以，行政法主要应当研究程序问题。
    会议还对行政强制执行、行政立法等问题进行了讨论。
