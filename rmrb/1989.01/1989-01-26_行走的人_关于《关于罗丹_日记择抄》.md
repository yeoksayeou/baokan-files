The Walking Man
—On "About Rodin: Diary Excerpts"

Once, I told a friend that if I were to go to Paris, I must bring along the book "About Rodin: Diary Excerpts" by Xiong Bingming (published by the Lion Book Company in Taiwan). It can help one understand and appreciate Rodin.

Is this book only needed when going to Paris and viewing Rodin's sculptures? Not really. In the journey of life, if one wants to live more clearly and beautifully, one should read this book.

Many books end up in the trash, barely glanced at before being discarded. Some books find their way into bookshelves, where their knowledge can be retrieved. But some books find their way into the reader's soul. This book is one of those. It is printed there, absorbed there, and shines there.

The cover of the book features a bronze statue by Rodin titled "The Walking Man," which has no head or arms but strides forward with large steps. The book says this is a manifestation of an indomitable spiritual force that can overcome any natural obstacles.

"That bold and majestic posture seems to define 'walking,' elevating it to a symbolic level of life, to the philosophical level of 'heavenly motion is vigorous.' Does man truly have a goal? Perhaps not. The act of ceaselessly moving forward is the purpose. Does humanity have a goal? Perhaps not. But humanity's relentless march forward is the meaning of its existence."

This is from the author's diary in 1947. I have not seen the statue, but these words have already moved and inspired me.

The book contains many profound and philosophical insights on art. It also discusses the relationship between philosophy and art. "If one cannot paint an apple with deeper meaning, it is better not to paint it. Philosophy without rich reality is also of no value." I noted this passage after reading a novel. The novel was Hermann Hesse's "Narcissus and Goldmund."

Suddenly, I remembered a philosopher who once lived abroad telling me how envious he was of novelists. Why? I did not understand.

A person with a philosophical mind and artistic practice is fortunate; someone who has been immersed in Western art and has been "transformed" by Chinese culture is even more fortunate. The book discusses the differences in artistic appreciation between the East and West, the "poetry of the human body," and the main ideas of romanticism. Deep and insightful views seem to flow effortlessly from the pen, making the reader feel smarter.

In 1949 and 1950, the author recorded twice discussing with friends the issue of returning to China. To return or not to return? They stood at a crossroads in life, each making their own choices. In early 1950, they had a night-long conversation. Friends returned to China, but the author stayed in Paris to continue his studies. In the diary entry for that day, there is a "current note" from 1982.

"For thirty years, life has been like a continuation of that night's talk—what was once unknown, sensed, and hoped for has either been realized, faded, or become a settled fact, with a revelation. Awakened now, in this moment. Reflecting on the past and present, I feel both distant and solemn."

Some people have compared those who returned and those who did not, those who went abroad and those who did not, of the same generation, to Shensheng and Chong'er. Indeed, the returning artists, after repeated painful self-reflections, felt their paintings were a waste of paper and consciously picked up horse dung paper to atone for their past sins. The author's sympathy for his friends is profound; he understands the weight of life and does not blame others for their self-reflections like some people do. However, after the revelation, there will be another revelation, new unknowns, new premonitions, and new hopes.

Without elegant words to convey these profound appreciations and deep emotions, it would not be the "Diary Excerpts" it is today. The words are exquisite, with a lingering aftertaste. I do not know how the author acquired such literary skill, a skill that seems effortless. He should have a talent for mathematics.

Xiong Bingming is currently a professor at the University of Paris III and the son of mathematician Xiong Qinglai. He is also an alumnus of Tsinghua University and lived in the western part of Tsinghua Garden, near the lotus pond, during his youth. Yunnan is his hometown. The "Excerpts" record his nostalgia for the faces of Chinese people—people from Kunming. "I am very familiar with that face, the contours of which are the hills and plains where I wandered and played as a child. I can almost close my eyes and run and jump there without falling."

Unbreakable homesickness pulls him closer to Paris. The world is getting smaller because people are walking.

Walk forward. Forward!

### 行走的人——关于《关于罗丹——日记择抄》

　　行走的人
    ——关于《关于罗丹——日记择抄》
    宗璞
    曾对朋友说，若到巴黎去，一定得带上熊秉明著《关于罗丹——日记择抄》这本书（台湾雄狮图书公司出版）。它能帮助理解罗丹，欣赏罗丹。
    难道只是去巴黎时，看罗丹雕塑时，才需要这书么？其实不是的。在人生的行程中，若想活得明白些，活得美些，都应读一读这本书。
    许多书的归宿是废纸堆，略一浏览，便可弃去。部分书的归宿是书柜，其中知识，可以取用。有些书的归宿则在读者的灵魂中。这书便是那样，印在那里，化在那里，亮在那里。
    书的封面上印着罗丹创作的铜像“行走的人”，没有头，也没有双臂，却迈开大步，在行走。书中说这是任何自然的阻力都抵挡不住的主体精神力量的显现。
    “那一个奋然迈步的豪壮的姿态，好像给‘走路’一个定义，把‘走路’提升到象征人生的层次去，提升到‘天行健’的哲学层次去。”“人果真有一个目标吗？怕并没有。不息地前去即是目的。全人类有一个目的吗？也许并没有。但全人类都亟亟地向前去，就是人类存在的意义。”
    这是作者１９４７年的日记。我没有见过那塑像，但已被这文字感染了，启发了。
    书中有许多警辟的充满哲理的艺术见解，也讲到哲学和艺术的关系。“画一个苹果，若不能画出苹果以上的意义，那大可不必画。哲学不包含丰富的现实，也一样没有价值。”我注意到这一段话是在读小说后写的。那小说是德国黑塞的《纳齐思和戈德蒙》。
    忽然记起有一位旅居海外的哲学家曾对我说，很羡慕你们写小说的人。何以呢？不明白。
    一个有哲学头脑而又有艺术实践的人是有福的；一个沐浴在西方艺术之中而又曾为中国文化所“化”过的人更是有福的。书中谈到东西方艺术鉴赏的差别，谈到“人体的诗篇”、浪漫主义的主要观念等。深刻的睿智的见解仿佛很不经意地从笔端流出，让读者也觉得自己聪明了许多。
    １９４９和１９５０年，作者两次记述了和朋友讨论回国问题。回不回去？他们处在人生的十字路口，各自作出抉择。１９５０年初，他们曾有一次彻夜的谈话，朋友们回国，作者因要继续学习，留在了巴黎。在这一天日记后有一个“今注”，是１９８２年的注。
    “三十年来的生活就仿佛是这一夜谈话的延续，——当时不可知的，预感着的，期冀着的，都或已实现，或已幻灭，或者已成定局，有了揭晓。醒来了，此刻。抚今追昔，感到疏然与肃然。”
    曾有人把回来的和不回来的，不出去和出去的同一代人比作申生与重耳。果然那回来的艺术家经过不断沉痛忏悔，竟以为自己的绘画是浪费了纸张，自觉地满街拣马粪纸，以赎前愆。作者对朋友的同情是深厚的，他知道生活的份量，不像有些人只知一味责备别人的检讨。不过在揭晓之后，还有揭晓，又会有新的不可知，新的预感和期冀。
    若无隽永的文字传达这些妙赏和深情，就不成为现在的“日记择抄”了，那文字是绝妙的，咀嚼三日而有余味。不知道作者怎样获得这样的文字功夫，毫不着力的功夫。照说他该有数学的天赋。
    熊秉明，现任巴黎第三大学教授，是数学家熊庆来先生之子；也曾是清华子弟，少年时在清华园西院，那荷塘的一侧居住过。云南是他的家乡。《择抄》中记了他对中国人——昆明人的面貌的怀念。“那面型我熟悉极了，那上面的起伏，是我从小徜徉游乐其间的山丘平野，我简直可以闭着眼睛在那里奔驰跳跃，而不至于跌仆。”
    扯不断的乡思，把他从巴黎拉近了。世界在变小，因为，人在行走。
    走向前去。向前去！
