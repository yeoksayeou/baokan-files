	In recent years, many primary and secondary schools in Romania have established student savings offices to encourage students to save their pocket money, fostering a habit of thrift and frugality.

	Currently, there are approximately 240 student savings offices in Romania, with a total savings amount of 17 million lei. Each student savings office is managed by the students themselves, with deposits made under collective accounts in the national savings bank. The interest earned is used to purchase sports equipment and other items.

	In addition to the student savings offices, Romanian primary and secondary schools also encourage savings through savings stamp collections and student "checks."

    罗中小学鼓励学生储蓄
    新华社布加勒斯特１月３日电  （记者陈进）近年来，罗马尼亚许多中小学校设立了学生储蓄所，鼓励学生把零花钱积攒起来，养成勤俭节约的好习惯。
    目前罗马尼亚约有２４０个学生储蓄所，储蓄总额达１７０万列伊。各学生储蓄所均由学生们自行管理，存款以集体户头存入国家储蓄所，所得利息用于购置体育器材等。
    除学生储蓄所外，罗马尼亚中小学校还通过储蓄集邮卡和学生“支票”来鼓励学生储蓄。
