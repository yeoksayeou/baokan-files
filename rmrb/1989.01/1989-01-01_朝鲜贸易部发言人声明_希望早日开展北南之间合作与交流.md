	Spokesperson of the DPRK Ministry of Foreign Trade Expresses Hope for Early Cooperation and Exchange Between North and South

	New China News Agency, Pyongyang, December 30, 1988

	The spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Trade of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea today issued a statement expressing the hope for an early resolution of political and military issues between the North and the South, so as to facilitate cooperation and exchange in various fields.

	The statement, reported by the Korean Central News Agency, pointed out that the South Korean authorities' claims of South Korea importing smokeless coal and seafood from the North through third countries, and the visit of the chairman of the Daewoo Group to Pyongyang, are all false reports.

	The statement said that achieving economic cooperation and exchange between the North and the South is our consistent position. Economic exchanges between the North and the South are precisely what we hope for. However, as long as the serious political and military confrontations between the North and the South are not resolved, it will be impossible to expect economic, cultural, and humanitarian exchanges and cooperation in the future.

	The statement said that to successfully carry out economic exchanges between the North and the South, high-level political and military talks between the North and the South must be held first. The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will spare no effort to achieve early multi-faceted cooperation and exchange between the North and the South.

　　朝鲜贸易部发言人声明
    希望早日开展北南之间合作与交流
    新华社平壤１９８８年１２月３０日电  朝鲜民主主义人民共和国贸易部发言人今天发表声明，希望早日解决北南之间的政治、军事问题，以便进行多方面的合作和交流。
    朝中社报道的这则声明指出，南朝鲜当局宣传南朝鲜通过第三国进口了北方的无烟煤和水产品，大宇集团会长访问了平壤等等，均系虚假的报道。
    声明说，实现北南之间的经济合作和交流是我们的一贯立场。北南之间开展经济来往，这正是我们的希望。但是，只要北南之间严重对峙的政治、军事问题得不到解决，今后将不可能期望有经济、文化和人道方面的交流与合作。
    声明说，要想成功地进行北南之间的经济交流，首先必须举行北南高级政治、军事会谈，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府将为早日进行北南之间多方面的合作与交流竭尽努力。
