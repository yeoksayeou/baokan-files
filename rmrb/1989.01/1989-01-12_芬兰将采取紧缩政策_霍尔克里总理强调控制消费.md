Finland to Implement Austerity Measures

Prime Minister Holkeri Emphasizes Controlling Consumption

Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki - At the start of the new year, Finnish Prime Minister Holkeri emphasized that both the public sector and individuals should control the growth of consumption to improve the country's international balance of payments and ensure healthy economic development.

Holkeri said on January 3 in a speech at the Turku Chamber of Commerce in southern Finland that while it is difficult to actually curb the growth of public sector spending, it is a necessary measure to correct the deficit in the balance of payments.

Currently, the Ministry of Finance is preparing a comprehensive package of economic austerity measures to be submitted to the government for discussion after mid-January.

Holkeri also believes that the labor-management negotiations starting this spring should reach an agreement to slow down the rate of inflation rather than affect the country's economic balance. He pointed out that Finland's international balance of payments situation in recent years has been worrying, with the main reason being that domestic consumption has significantly exceeded the growth of production capacity, leading to an increase in foreign debt.

In the 1980s, Finland's economic development was quite successful. Last year, economic growth is expected to reach 4.5%. However, at the same time, public consumption also grew rapidly. The proportion of public consumption in the gross national product increased from 18% in the early 1980s to 21% this year. Consumer loans increased by one-third last year, and imports of consumer goods simultaneously increased by one-fifth.

Various excessive and rapid increases in consumption inevitably lead to a deterioration in the balance of payments.

　　芬兰将采取紧缩政策
    霍尔克里总理强调控制消费
    新华社赫尔辛基电  （记者郑焕清）新年伊始，芬兰总理霍尔克里强调公共部门和私人都应控制消费的增长，以改善国家的国际收支状况，并确保经济的健康发展。
    霍尔克里１月３日在南部城市土尔库商会发表讲话指出，尽管抑制公共部门开支增长实际执行起来是困难的，但是它是纠正收支逆差问题必不可少的措施。
    目前，财政部正在准备有关紧缩经济政策的一揽子方案，以便在１月中旬后递交政府讨论。
    霍尔克里还认为，今春开始的劳资谈判应该达成减缓通货膨胀速度而不是影响国家经济平衡的协议。他指出，芬兰近年来国际收支发展状况是令人不安的，其主要原因是国内消费明显超过生产能力的增长，从而导致外债增加。
    在８０年代，芬兰经济发展颇为顺利。去年，经济增长预计达到４．５％。然而，与此同时，公共消费也迅速增长。公共消费在国民生产总值的比例从８０年代初的１８％增至今年的２１％。消费贷款去年增长１／３，消费品的进口同时增加１／５。
    各种消费增长过多、过猛必然导致收支状况的恶化。
