Newcomers Inexperienced, Timing Off

    – Coaches from Guangdong and Hong Kong Teams Discuss Guangdong Team's Loss

    Yue Yongrong (Guangdong Team): Our team's loss in this match is related to the players' unstable mental state. After winning the first round, the players thought they had the victory in hand and played more loosely, with less aggressive pressing. Additionally, we have many newcomers, whose skills are not yet fully developed, and their experience is lacking. As for not substituting veterans when falling behind, it's mainly because the veterans' competitive condition is not good either.

    Guo Jiaming (Hong Kong Team): In this match, our team's performance was excellent. The 4:2 victory is a rare masterpiece since 1985, which will boost Hong Kong's confidence in participating in the World Cup qualifiers. The key to victory was equalizing 1:1 in the second half, which boosted the players' morale and disrupted the opponent's attacking and defending rhythm. Additionally, by substituting players to strengthen the attack, we successfully breached Guangdong's defense, achieving unexpected success. The strategy of recalling Babelli to strengthen the attack was correct. After Guangdong scored a goal in the first half, they showed signs of complacency and lacked aggressive pressing. This also proves that this team's strength and level are not as good as the Guangdong team that participated in the National Games.

　　新手尚嫩　火候不到
    ——省港两队教练谈广东队失利原因
    岳永荣（广东队）：这场球我队的失利与队员心理不稳有关。第一回合获胜后，队员们以为稳操胜券，打得较为松散，逼抢也不紧。同时新手较多，技术尚欠火候，经验更显不足。至于落后时没及时换上老将，主要是因为老队员竞技状态也不太好。
    郭家明（香港队）：这一场比赛，我队队员发挥很好，４∶２获胜的结果是自１９８５年以来打出的少有佳作。这将使香港队参加世界杯外围赛增强信心。取胜的关键是下半时追成１∶１，鼓舞了队员士气，打乱了对手的攻防节奏。另外，通过替换队员加强进攻力，冲击广东队的后防，取得了意外的成功。重召巴贝利归队加强攻击力的策略是对的。广东队在上半时进一球后，显出有些轻敌，逼抢不紧。这也证明了这支队伍在实力和水平不及全运会时的那支广东队。
