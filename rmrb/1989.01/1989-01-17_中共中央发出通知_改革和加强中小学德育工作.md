The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China recently issued a notice on reforming and strengthening moral education in primary and secondary schools. The notice points out that building our country into a prosperous, democratic, and civilized socialist modern state and realizing the common ideal of all ethnic groups in China requires the unremitting efforts of several generations. Today's primary and secondary school students will be the main force in socialist construction in the 21st century. Their ideological and moral standards and scientific and cultural qualities not only reflect an important aspect of the current level of social civilization but also have a decisive influence on the future social landscape and national spirit of our country. From now on, we must strive to cultivate them into a new generation of people with ideals, morality, culture, and discipline. (The full text of the notice is on the third page.)
