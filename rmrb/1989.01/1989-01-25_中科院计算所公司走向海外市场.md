The Computing Technology Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which won the first national science and technology progress first-class award in China's computer industry, is not content with its leading position in the domestic market. It is striving to explore the path for the computer industry to go global. By the end of last year, the Hong Kong Lianxiang Computer Co., Ltd., which was jointly established and opened in Hong Kong by the Computing Technology Institute, had achieved a business volume of $9.3 million in just eight months. One-third of the computer products were sold to Europe, Southeast Asia, and other regions, with the net profit from operations exceeding three times the total investment.

In April of last year, the Computing Technology Institute established a joint venture computer company in Hong Kong. In a relatively short period, it mastered the demand situation and sales laws of the international market. The business area expanded from 300 square meters to 1,800 square meters, and the business volume ranked first among peers in Hong Kong. Through international business operations, they grasped the development trends of the foreign computer industry and achieved the company's transformation from a trading-oriented to a comprehensive technology-trade model half a year ahead of schedule.

　　中科院计算所公司走向海外市场
    本报讯  记者费伟伟报道：荣获我国计算机界第一个国家科技进步一等奖的中国科学院计算所公司，不满足于国内领先地位，努力探索计算机工业走向世界的道路。截至去年底，这个公司与香港合资、开业仅８个月的香港联想电脑有限公司，营业额已达９３０万美元，其中１／３的计算机产品销往欧洲、东南亚等地，营业净利润超过投资总和的３倍。
    去年４月，计算所公司在香港成立了合资经营的电脑公司，在较短时间内就掌握了国际市场的需求情况和销售规律，营业面积由３００平方米增加到１８００平方米，营业额高居香港同行业之首。他们通过国际经营贸易，掌握了国外计算机工业的发展动向，比计划提前半年多实现了公司由贸易型向技工贸立体型的转变。
