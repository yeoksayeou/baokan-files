	Reforming the old personnel system is not like walking the "Shu Road." The Ministry of Civil Affairs recently concluded its public recruitment of 30 officials from society. After assessment, the 30 recruited officials have started working at the department.

	This is the first time that a central state organ has publicly recruited officials from society. A relevant official from the Ministry of Civil Affairs told a reporter that they decided to do this mainly because the current channels for selecting officials cannot meet the needs of building the cadre team, and there is a lack of testing methods, making it difficult to control the quality of new recruits. More importantly, publicly recruiting officials from society is conducive to talent competition and has explored a new path for accelerating the reform of the cadre personnel system.

	On November 5 last year, the news that the Ministry of Civil Affairs decided to publicly recruit officials from society spread, and applicants from all directions totaled 892 people. After the preliminary examination, 421 people who met the conditions were determined to participate in the written test, 100 people who passed the written test participated in the professional oral examination, and finally, 30 people were selected.

	All participants in the examination have a college education or above, of which 34.2% have a bachelor's degree or above, and most are around 35 years old; the majority work in small and medium-sized enterprises. Most of them are college graduates from the past two or three years who want to move because their work does not match their skills or for other reasons.

	It is understood that a considerable number of examinees are looking for a job position where they can play to their strengths. A manager from a certain company told the recruitment staff, "If I work in the government, my salary will only be one-third of what it is now, which will bring some difficulties to my personal life, but I don't mind, because I can get training at a higher level. I believe I can achieve something in my career."

	Regarding this public recruitment of officials, a relevant official from the Ministry of Civil Affairs believes that there are four advantages: First, it broadens the channels for selecting officials, making up for the past narrow selection channels; second, it is conducive to implementing the policy of "selecting the virtuous and appointing the able" and overcoming the improper practices in the selection of officials; third, the mutual willingness of the employing unit and the recruited person creates conditions for future harmonious work; fourth, this recruitment of officials was conducted according to the basic requirements of the national examination and recruitment of civil servants that will soon be implemented, thus laying the foundation and accumulating experience for implementing this system.

	As for the shortcomings, the official pointed out that the main issue is that although a unified examination seems fair, a single test paper has limited capacity and cannot meet the needs of various professions. The examination also cannot fully reflect a person's level, which may bury some talents. This is an area that needs improvement in the future recruitment of officials.

　　改革人事旧制并非如行“蜀道”
    民政部向社会招考３０名干部
    不足之处：一张考卷定“乾坤”，可能埋没人才
    新华社北京１月２日电  （记者陈雁）民政部面向社会公开招考干部工作日前顺利结束，经过考核后被录用的３０名干部已陆续到部机关上班。
    面向社会公开招考干部，这在中央国家机关尚属首次。民政部有关负责人对记者说，他们决定这样做主要考虑是：目前选调干部的渠道不能满足干部队伍建设的需要，且缺乏检测手段，难以把住进人质量关，更重要的是，向社会公开招考干部有利于人才竞争，为加速干部人事制度的改革探索了一条新路。
    去年１１月５日民政部决定面向社会公开招考干部的消息传开后，来自四面八方的应试者多达８９２人，经过初试后，符合条件被确定参加笔试的为４２１人，笔试合格参加专业口试的１００人，最后择优选定３０人。
    参加应试者都是大专以上文化程度，其中大学本科以上文化程度占３４．２％，年龄多在３５岁左右；工作单位以中小企业居多。他们多数是因工作不大对口或其他原因要求流动的近两三年毕业的大学生。
    据了解，有相当一部分应试者是想找一个能发挥自己作用的工作岗位。一位前来应试的某公司负责人对招考人员说，如果我到机关工作，工资只相当于现在的１／３，这会给我的个人生活带来一些困难，但我不在乎，因为我可以在更高的层次上得到锻炼。我相信自己能在事业上有所作为。
    对这次公开招考干部的作法，民政部有关负责人认为，其利有四，首先，拓宽了选调干部的渠道，弥补了过去选人渠道狭窄的不足；其次，有利于“选贤任能”方针的贯彻和克服调人问题上的不正之风；第三，用人单位与被录取者的两厢情愿，为今后工作的和谐创造了条件；第四，这次招考干部是按照即将实行的国家考试录用公务员的基本要求进行的，因此，为实行这一制度打下了基础，积累了经验。
    至于不足之处，这位负责人指出，主要是统一考试视似公允，但一张考卷容量有限，难以满足多种专业的需要，考试也很难全面反映一个人的水平，有可能埋没一些人才，这是今后录用干部需要改进的。
