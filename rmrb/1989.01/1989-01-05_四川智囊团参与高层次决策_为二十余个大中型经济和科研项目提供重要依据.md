The Sichuan Provincial Science and Technology Advisory Committee, consisting of 509 experts and scholars, has become the highest-level decision-making consulting body in the province, contributing to the revitalization of the local economy and the development of science and technology.

The Sichuan Provincial Science and Technology Advisory Committee was established in 1983. Its members, appointed by the provincial Party Committee and the provincial government, are mainly leaders in various disciplines such as natural sciences and social sciences within the province, heads of academic organizations, or highly respected experts and senior and intermediate-level scientific and technological personnel. The advisory committee is divided into 17 major professional categories and over 100 sub-disciplines, forming a relatively comprehensive "think tank" with a full range of disciplines and functions.

In recent years, the advisory committee has completed 48 research tasks proposed by the provincial Party Committee and the provincial government. Among them, the research reports on topics such as "Factors for Stable Grain Production in Sichuan Province and Corresponding Measures" and "Priority Development Sequence and Strategies for Mineral Resources in Sichuan Province" have received attention and praise from the decision-making level. The "Seventh Five-Year Plan" data communication network construction plan for the province, the feasibility evaluation of the 300,000-kilowatt Ertan Hydropower Station project, and the feasibility plan for the construction of the Chengdu to Dazhou railway line, among more than 20 major and medium-sized economic construction and scientific research projects, have all become important bases for decision-making. Many of the adopted plans have achieved good economic benefits due to correct investment decisions. The construction and operation of the Guanghua Polyester Plant with an annual production capacity of 5,000 tons of polyester staple fiber is a good example. After the advisory committee organized a review, the provincial Economic Commission immediately approved the project for construction. In 1987, the output value reached 55.01 million yuan, with tax profits of nearly 50 million yuan.

Nowadays, some macro-level decisions and major and medium-sized engineering projects in Sichuan Province often first seek the opinions of the Science and Technology Advisory Committee or request the advisory committee to organize experts for review to reduce unnecessary mistakes.

　　四川智囊团参与高层次决策
    为二十余个大中型经济和科研项目提供重要依据
    本报成都电  记者罗茂城报道：由５０９名专家、学者组成的四川省科技顾问团，目前已成为该省最高层次的决策咨询机构，为振兴当地经济、发展科技事业作出了贡献。
    四川省科技顾问团成立于１９８３年，成员由省委、省府聘请，多为省内自然科学、社会科学等领域的学科带头人、学术组织负责人，或有较高威望的专家和高中级科技人员。顾问团分属１７个专业大类，１００余个分支专业，从而形成了一个学科门类比较齐全、功能比较全面的“智囊团”。
    近几年来，顾问团先后完成了省委、省府提出的４８项研究任务。其中，“四川省粮食稳定增产因素及相应措施”、“四川省矿产资源优先开发顺序及对策”等专题研究报告，受到决策层的重视和好评。省“七五”数据通信网建设方案、二滩３００万千瓦水电站立项可行性评估，以及修建成都至达县铁路路线的可行性方案等２０余项大、中型经济建设和科研项目的研究，均成为决策的重要依据。不少被采纳的方案，因投资决策正确而取得良好的经济效益。年产５０００吨涤纶长丝的广华涤纶总厂建成投产便是一例。它经顾问团组织论证后，省计经委立即批准立项建设，１９８７年产值即达５５０１万元，获税利近５００万元。
    现在，四川省一些宏观决策和大、中型工程项目，往往先征询科技顾问团的意见，或请顾问团组织专家论证，以减少不必要的失误。
