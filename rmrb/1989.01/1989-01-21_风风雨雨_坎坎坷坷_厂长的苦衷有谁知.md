	Storms and Struggles: The Plight of a Factory Director

	I became the factory director in 1986. With the efforts of the entire factory's workforce, our enterprise, which was on the brink of collapse, showed signs of revival. However, the storms and struggles of the past two years have made me realize: being a factory director is too difficult.

	Dealing with unreasonable demands is hard to handle. In April 1988, the factory planned to renovate the staff housing. One worker's old kitchen was within the demolition range. I sent people to persuade him to move his stove and promised to build him a new kitchen immediately, but he refused to listen. In the end, the factory decided to demolish it by force. Who would have thought that this would cause trouble? On the day the kitchen was demolished, this worker gathered a few people and came to my house in a threatening manner, staying until 2 AM the next day. That day, I happened not to be at home, and my wife and children were frightened and fell ill for several days. This worker also boasted that he would break my legs and wrote a complaint letter, causing a stir in the city. I reported this to the public security bureau, but they told me to go to the court; I reported it to the higher authorities, but they did not handle it. I really couldn't understand: if things go on like this, who would dare to be a factory director?

	Being falsely accused and having no one to turn to. In September 1987, one of our workers went outside to participate in a bidding speech. Before the speech, he had to fill out a qualification review form. In order to win votes, he fabricated facts and falsely reported his work achievements. I asked him to report the facts truthfully and required him to settle the accounts of the store he was in charge of before bidding. After he failed to win the bid, he complained everywhere, saying that I used my authority to persecute him. The relevant departments of the city and district sent people to investigate and found that this worker was purely making false accusations. However, the false accusations were made, but my reputation was not protected.

	Dealing with "begging monks" is difficult. Nowadays, there are many units in society that, under various pretexts, demand money and goods from enterprises. Some demand according to regulations, some just by word of mouth, and some openly extort. These units all have some power, and they can easily find a reason to punish the enterprise. In front of these "begging monks," the enterprise can only bear the pain and give in.

	I believe that there are not just a few factory directors with such difficulties. To cultivate a group of capable entrepreneurs in China, in addition to improving the quality of the factory directors themselves, a good external environment must also be created for them.

### 风风雨雨　坎坎坷坷　厂长的苦衷有谁知

　　风风雨雨　坎坎坷坷
  　厂长的苦衷有谁知
    我是１９８６年担任厂长的。在我和全厂职工的努力下，我们濒临困境的企业出现了生机。然而，两年多的风风雨雨使我感到：当厂长太难了。
    无理取闹难招架。１９８８年４月，厂里统一规划家属房，一名职工的旧厨房在拆除范围内。我派人多次劝他搬出灶具，并答应马上给他建新厨房，但他就是不理。无奈，厂里决定派人强行拆除。谁知这下惹出麻烦。厨房拆除的当天，这个职工便纠集了几个人气势汹汹来到我家，一直闹到第二天凌晨２点仍不离去。那天，我恰巧不在家，妻子儿女遭此惊吓，病了好几天。这个职工还四处扬言，要打断我的腿，并写上告信，弄得满城风雨。我向公安局反映，公安局让我找法院；向上级主管部门反映，可主管部门又不管。我真想不通：这样下去，谁还敢当厂长？
    受到诬陷无人管。１９８７年９月，我厂一名职工到外面参加招标演讲，演讲前要先填写资格审查表。为了赢得选票，他捏造事实，谎报工作成绩。我让他实事求是地填报，并要求他在应标前将他所承包的门市部的帐目结清。他在落标后，四处告状，说我利用职权，对他打击迫害。市、区有关部门派人调查后，证明这个职工纯属诬陷。可是诬陷就诬陷了，我的名誉却无人维护。
    “化缘和尚”难应付。现在社会上有不少单位打着种种旗号，向企业要钱、要物。有的根据文件的规定要，有的全凭嘴说，有的干脆公开索取。这些单位都握有一定的权力，他们随便拿出一条理由就能处罚企业，在这些“化缘和尚”面前，企业只好忍痛割爱。
    我认为，有这种苦衷的厂长不止我一人。中国要造就一大批有作为的企业家，除了厂长自身的素质要提高外，还须为他们创造一个良好的外部环境。
