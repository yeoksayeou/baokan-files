Japan to Establish Human Development Foundation in London

    Japan will establish a "Human Development Foundation" in London. The decision was recently made by the Japanese government to strengthen scientific research exchanges with overseas partners and promote international human development engineering research.

    According to a report by the *Nihon Keizai Shimbun*, the Japanese government plans to reach an agreement with European and American countries at the upcoming summit of developed nations this summer and secure funding for the research by the end of this year.

    The "Human Development Engineering Research Program," also known as the "Human New Domain Research Program," was proposed by former Japanese Prime Minister Nakasone at the 1986 summit of developed nations. It is said that this program will become the largest research topic of the 21st century, with a focus on elucidating the mechanisms of brain activity and neural information transmission. Japan estimates that it will require an investment of 100 billion yen over 20 years, with half of that amount to be provided by Japan.

　　日本将在伦敦建立人体开发财团
    新华社东京１月２３日电  日本政府最近做出决定，日本将在伦敦建立“人体开发财团”，以加强与海外的科研交流，推动国际性的人体开发工程研究。
    据《日本经济新闻》报道，日本政府计划在今年夏季举行的发达国家首脑会议上与欧美各国达成协议，并于今年内拿出资金开始研究。
    “人体开发工程研究计划”，又称“人体新领域研究计划”，它是日本前首相中曾根在１９８６年的发达国家首脑会议上提出的国际基础研究设想。据称这一计划将成为２１世纪科学研究的最大课题，其中心是查明人脑活动和神经传递信息的机制。日本预计２０年内需研究投资１万亿日元，其中半数由日本提供。
