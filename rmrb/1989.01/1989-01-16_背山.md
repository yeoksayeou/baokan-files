Title: Back to the Mountain

I am a child of the mountains. When I was seven, my mother said, "Child, you can't eat without working. Go up to Temple Mountain to chop firewood." Thus, I climbed up the very high Temple Mountain. I did not see the temple, but I was astonished by the endless, countless mountains that seemed to support the sky and fill the earth.

I returned home with a load of firewood, carrying not only the wood but also a heavy, confused heart. My mother was lifting the lid off the pot. I noticed that the lid was like the sky, and the pot was like the earth. The steamer was full of steamed buns made of coarse grain, which looked very much like the yellow earth mountains.

"Mother, are the steamed buns the children of the mountains?"

"Silly child, what nonsense are you talking about!"

"Why do they look so much alike?"

Mother did not answer, she just patted my head and gave a sad smile.

A little older, I understood that the steamed buns were not the children of the mountains, but the steamer in the homes of mountain people was always full of steamed buns.

The next time I went up the mountain, seeing the children chopping firewood, the girls picking bitter vegetables, and the men on the mountain paths barefoot and shirtless, carrying heavy loads, I felt that the mountain people were not just carrying firewood and vines, but the yellow earth mountains tied with rope-like mountain paths.

So, I hoped to grow up quickly, to become a strong man stronger than the mountains. When I realized that this wish was still a child's naive thought, I became very afraid of climbing the mountain to chop firewood.

Fortunately, before I reached the age of "carrying the mountain," I was carried out of the mountains by a donkey and went to work in the city.

During my leisure time, whenever I heard people talk about the mountain villages, mountain lands, mountain people, and people from the mountains, I would feel tears welling up in my eyes and dream every night of carrying the mountain, how heavy, how tiring, how bitter it was! For more than ten years, those rope-like mountain paths have always been pulling at my heart.

Recently, a fellow villager who was passing through on business stopped by. He looked at my humble home and jokingly said, "After working these years, why are you still like a poor peasant? Why not go back to the mountains to build the earth? If you can't afford the train ticket, I'll send you back on my electric donkey."

Unable to resist the temptation, I was indeed carried back to the mountains by the electric donkey. It was a coincidence that I met my mother just lifting the lid off the pot: the sky was like a lid, the earth like a pot, but the steamer was full to the brim with steamed buns that looked like mountains, steaming with "morning fog."

"Child, eat your fill, then go up to Temple Mountain to see the fireworks."

What fireworks? I wondered, as I walked up the mountain along the wide, new, yellow earth road that was not yet dry. Ah! Temple Mountain, truly living up to its name, a temple with halls on all four sides stood before my eyes. The crowd was as dense as a mountain, supporting the sky and filling the earth, making it impossible to see clearly or count. I also saw children all over the mountain, girls everywhere, but each one was like a wall painting, dressed in bright, eye-catching clothes, holding fashionable canned drinks in their hands. Those familiar yet strange fathers and brothers, no one was barefoot, nor did they carry heavy loads. They all generously took out large bills from their bulging pockets and stuffed them into the "donation box" without hesitation. Seeing this, I was both happy and puzzled. As I wandered to the main hall, the incense smoke was thick, and the ground was covered with cigarette butts in front of the clay statue. I saw that the children, girls, fathers, and brothers were all sincerely praying, kneeling, and bowing like grinding garlic. I was once again confused, and unintentionally sighed, "Why are they so superstitious?"

"Superstitious, superstitious, confused and then believe it," replied a young man wearing glasses who had not knelt down. Was he a student? A teacher? Or... Before I could ask, he turned away coldly and left the temple in large strides. I stood there, stunned, for a long time. In a daze, I seemed to see the mountains moving on people's shoulders—mountains of wild grass, mountains of ignorance. I suddenly felt as if I were really carrying the mountain, and I felt heavy, my legs were weak, my breath was short, my head was dizzy, and I felt uncomfortable.

Ah, my hometown, the countless, uncountable mountains that support the sky and fill the earth!

　　背山
    林荫
    我是山里娃，七岁时，娘就说：“娃，吃不得闲饭了，上庙山砍柴去。”于是，我爬上了好高好高的庙山。未见庙，却被那看不过来、数不清楚、撑着天、挤满地的绵绵山峦惊得目瞪口呆……
    背着柴，也背着沉沉懵懂归来。娘正揭锅，我发现盖如天，锅似地，蒸笼上满满的糠窝窝头，极像黄土山。
    “娘，窝窝头是山的娃娃吗？”
    “憨娃，瞎说什么呀！”
    “为甚那么像呢？”
    娘未作答，只摸了摸我的头，凄苦一笑。
    稍大些，便明白，窝窝头不是山的娃娃，可山里人家的蒸笼上却只有窝窝头。
    再次上山，看着那满山砍柴禾的乡童，遍地拔苦菜的山女，和山道上那赤脚抠地，裸肩负重的父兄们，就觉得山里人背上压着的不是柴藤瓜蔓，而是一座座绳索般的条条山道捆绑着的黄土山。于是，我盼自己快长，长成比山还结实的壮汉。当我明白，此愿仍属孩童的稚想后，就十分害怕爬山砍柴了……
    侥幸，未到“背山”的年龄，我就被毛驴驮着，走出山峦，到城里工作了。
    工作之余，每每听人谈及山村、山地、山民、山里人，我就泪涌心头，就夜夜梦见背山，好沉、好重、好累、好苦呀！十多年了，那绳索似的山道无时不牵系着我的心。
    近日，跑生意的故乡人，路过门前，留他小息。他看着我简陋的窝，就戏谑说：“工作这些年，咋还是‘贫下中农本色’呀，不如回山修地球吧，不出两年，包你‘三眼石窑一线线，新门亮窗独院院。’买不起车票的话，我这电驴子送你回去。”
    经不住诱惑，我真被电驴子驮回山里来了。巧了，又逢娘正揭锅：天如盖，地似锅，可蒸笼上那满满溢溢极像山的，竟成了冒着“晨雾”的白面馍。
    “娃，尽管吃，吃饱了上庙山看红火去。”
    哪来的红火？我纳闷着，沿宽宽的新土未干的黄土路绕上山顶。呀！庙山，名副其实了，一座左右前后厅堂齐全的庙宇，兀立眼前，赶会的人稠得山一样，撑着天，挤满地，令人看不过来，数不清楚。也见乡童满山，山女遍地，却个个墙画般，衣着花艳夺目，手里攥着入时的筒装饮料。那些携儿拉女似曾相识又皆陌生的父老兄弟们，没人打赤脚，更不负重，都十分慷慨地从鼓起的兜里，掏出大张的人民币，毫不啬吝塞进“布施箱”。看到此，我既欣喜又感疑惑。逛至正殿，香烟缭绕，纸灰遍地的泥胎前，只见乡童山女父老兄弟，无不虔诚祈祷，捣蒜般叩头，作揖，我重又陷入懵懂，无意中脱口低叹：“为何如此迷信呢？”
    “迷信，迷信，犯迷了就信呗。”接茬的是位没有下跪的戴眼镜青年，是学生？是教师？还是……未及问明，他便冷然转身，大步流星离庙而去。我愣在那儿，呆呆地伫立了许久，许久。恍惚间，我似乎看见人们肩上蠕动的仍是一座座长满野草的荒山——思想的荒山。我自己也猝然像真的背上了山，顿觉身重，腿沉，气憋，头晕，不舒服起来。
    哎，故乡那数不过来、看不清楚、撑着天、挤满地的山吆！
