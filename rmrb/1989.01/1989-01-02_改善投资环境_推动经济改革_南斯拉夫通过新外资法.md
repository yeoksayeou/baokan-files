Improving the Investment Environment and Promoting Economic Reform: Yugoslavia Passes New Foreign Investment Law

New China News Agency, Belgrade, December 30th

(Reporter Xià Shìhuá) The Federal Assembly of the Republics and Autonomous Provinces of Yugoslavia today passed a new foreign investment law, which will create a favorable investment environment for foreign investors and also create important conditions for Yugoslavia's economic reforms.

The new foreign investment law, for the first time, clearly stipulates that foreign investors enjoy equal status with domestic investors in Yugoslavia. It allows foreign investors to establish wholly-owned enterprises without time and location restrictions. It also affirms that foreign investors can exercise management rights in joint ventures according to their investment ratio. The new law stipulates that foreign investors can use foreign exchange, Yugoslav currency dinars, machinery, equipment, and technology to make investments, and can also convert Yugoslavia's foreign debt into investments. Except for the defense, security, and environmental protection sectors, joint ventures can be established in all other sectors. Except for the military industry, railways, aviation, postal services, insurance, news, publishing, and foreign trade sectors, foreign investors can establish wholly-owned enterprises in all other sectors.

The new law simplifies the application procedures for foreign investors to establish joint ventures and wholly-owned enterprises and stipulates that foreign investors have the right to withdraw their principal and interest. The new law also provides many tax concessions to foreign investors, such as exempting the profits of joint ventures and wholly-owned enterprises for the first five years of establishment and the profits reinvested as capital from income tax.

　　改善投资环境　推动经济改革
    南斯拉夫通过新外资法
    新华社贝尔格莱德十二月三十日电  （记者夏士华）南斯拉夫联邦议会共和国与自治省院今天通过新的外资法，将为外国投资者创造优越的投资环境，也为南进行经济改革创造了重要条件。
    新的外资法首次明确规定外国投资者与南本国投资者享有同等地位，允许外国投资者不受时间和地点限制在南开办独资企业，肯定外国投资者可按投资比例对合资企业享有管理权。新法规定，外国投资者可以用外汇、南货币第纳尔、机器设备和工艺技术进行投资，也可以把南斯拉夫欠的外债变为投资。除国防、安全和环境保护部门外，均可建立合资企业，除军工、铁路、航空、邮电、保险、新闻、出版和外贸部门外，外国投资者均可在南建立独资企业。
    新法简化了外国投资者开办合资和独资企业的申请手续，并规定外国投资者有权抽回本利。新法在所得税方面还给予外国投资者许多优惠，例如对合资和独资企业创办头五年的利润和作为资本重新投入的利润可以减免所得税。
