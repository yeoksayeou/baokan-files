Li Zibin took over as the director of the Jinxi Chemical General Factory, a factory with ten thousand employees, four years ago. Since then, the enterprise has undergone astonishing changes. In the first half of 1984, the factory only realized a profit of 320,000 yuan. In the second half of the year, after Li took over, the profit surged to 5.5 million yuan. Since then, the annual profit has continued to increase by 40% each year.

Here, we won't discuss how Li Zibin's management strategies outshine others, nor will we talk about how he handled various production difficulties. Instead, let's talk about his approach to hiring.

	Selecting Talent: Avoiding a One-Size-Fits-All Approach

After taking office, Li Zibin focused on adjusting the leadership teams of the second and third levels (sub-factories and workshops). Someone concernedly told him, "Our factory has complex personnel relationships. It's hard to say who is related to whom. It's better to draw a line based on the 'Four Modernizations' standards. Anyone without a degree or over 50 should be demoted." Li Zibin, however, believed that adjusting the leadership teams must be based on reality. While adhering to the "Four Modernizations" requirements, he did not advocate for "degree-only" policies or age-based demotions. These ideas resonated with Li Hongdao, the factory's party secretary. Li Hongdao supported him. Thus, during the adjustment of the second and third-level leadership teams, both young, educated, and capable individuals and older, experienced, and dedicated workers without degrees were retained. The former quickly adapted to their roles, while the latter made new contributions, with some becoming the factory's "pioneers." Examples include Wang Zhiming and Zhang Shuan from the Chlor-Alkali Division, and Li Wenge from the Organic Division, all of whom were over 50 and without degrees. When they heard about the factory's adjustments, they assumed they would be demoted and proactively submitted their resignations to Li Zibin. Li Zibin said, "No, you can't leave." He was well aware of their achievements and capabilities. After being retained, they quickly brought order to their divisions. After the adjustments, the entire factory's work improved rapidly.

	Valuing Talent: Focusing on Practical Solutions

This factory once experienced a significant outflow of technical talent. From 1982 to the first half of 1984, 88 intermediate-level intellectuals left, severely impacting the factory. When Li Zibin took office, some technical personnel still held job offers from other places and requested transfers. Due to years of poor management, the factory had many living issues. Most intellectuals lived in accommodations smaller than 10 square meters, without kitchens or plumbing. Additionally, the number of unemployed children increased yearly, making it difficult for them to focus on work.

Li Zibin decided to address these practical issues. Old workers said, "We can't let the 'intellectuals' leave! Our factory's development depends on them." In 1985, several residential buildings were constructed, and intermediate-level intellectuals were housed in one of them. Workers jokingly referred to this building as the "Panda Building," likening the intellectuals, many of whom wore glasses, to lovable pandas, and emphasizing that intellectuals are national treasures. The factory also stipulated that, in the future, regardless of whether they were transferred from other units or promoted internally, all intermediate-level intellectuals would be allocated two-bedroom apartments with a kitchen. Li Zibin personally visited provincial and municipal officials to secure support, using the factory's natural reduction in personnel to solve the employment issues of their unemployed children. For individual special cases, Li Zibin went out of his way to help. An engineer, along with his spouse, both from the south, had a mother-in-law bedridden and unable to care for herself in their hometown. They repeatedly requested a transfer back home. Li Zibin granted his spouse several months of leave to care for the elderly mother and expressed hope that they could bring her to the factory. The factory provided a room for her. The couple and the elderly woman were deeply moved and decided to stay at Jinxi Chemical for life.

	Utilizing Talent: Being Magnanimous

Li Zibin's approach to talent is based on the needs of the enterprise, without personal grudges.

The current chief economist, Wang Xinsheng, once criticized Li Zibin publicly while serving as a grassroots official, saying that the factory's contracts were poorly drafted, "Is this a contract? It's more like forcing Yang Baolao to sign a deed of indenture!" He refused to sign. Initially, Li Zibin was surprised by this person's bluntness. However, upon reflection, he realized that while the grassroots official's words were somewhat disrespectful, the contract indeed had flaws. After revisions, Wang Xinsheng signed the contract and executed it diligently, exceeding the contracted targets. Li Zibin recognized Wang Xinsheng's integrity, insight, and work capabilities, and selected him for the factory's leadership team.

A renowned graduate from a prestigious university once had a falling out with Li Zibin. After Li Zibin became the director, that individual became very disheartened. However, Li Zibin believed he had a solid foundation of knowledge and rich research experience, planning to promote him to the factory's chief technical officer. Someone said, "Forget it, promote anyone else, but not him. Will he listen to you? Don't make things difficult for yourself." Li Zibin still promoted that individual to a technical leadership position and gave him a pay raise. The individual was deeply moved, working diligently and making breakthroughs in the factory's research and development projects.

　　用人有方
    ——记锦西化工总厂厂长李子彬
    周毓山
    李子彬就任万人大厂——锦西化工总厂厂长４年，企业发生了惊人的变化。１９８４年上半年仅实现利润３２万元，他上任后的下半年利润竟达５５０万元，此后，每年利润以４０％的幅度持续上升。
    这里，不说李子彬的经营战略如何高出一筹，也不说他怎样处理一个个生产难题，只说说他的用人之道。
    　　　　选才，不搞“一刀切”
    李子彬上任后抓了调整二、三级（分厂、车间）班子，有人关切地跟他说：“咱厂人事关系复杂，说不准谁和谁是至亲好友，扯耳动腮，用谁不用谁不好办。莫如按‘四化’标准划个线，凡是没有文凭的，年过５０的统统下。”李子彬却认为，调整领导班子，必须从实际出发，既要按“四化”要求，又不能搞“唯文凭论”，更不能在年龄上搞“一刀切”。他的这些想法与总厂党委书记李宏道想到一起去了。李宏道支持他。就这样，调整二、三级班子时，既充实了一批有文凭、年轻有为干部，也保留了一批有觉悟、能力强、没文凭、年龄偏大一点的骨干。前者很快适应了工作，后者作出了新贡献，有的成了总厂的“排头兵”。氯碱分厂的王志民、张树安，有机分厂的李文阁等人都没有文凭，而且已经年过半百。听说厂里调整二、三级班子，他们以为自己必下无疑，于是主动找李子彬提出辞职。李子彬说：“不，你们不能下去”。他对他们的实绩和能力很清楚。几个人破格留任后，很快把分厂治理得井井有条。二、三级班子调整后，全厂工作迅速改观。
    　　　　爱才，重在办实事
    这个厂一度技术人才外流比较严重，１９８２年至１９８４年上半年已有８８名中级知识分子调走，伤了元气。李子彬上任时，有些技术人员还在拿着外地的聘书，要求调走。厂内由于多年经营不景气，生活上欠账很多，大部分知识分子住在不足１０平方米、既没有厨房、也没有上下水的宿舍里。加上待业子女逐年增加，工作没有着落，他们很难安心工作。
    李子彬下决心解决这些实际问题。老工人说：“可不能让‘老九’走了哇！咱厂要大发展离不开他们。”１９８５年盖了几栋住宅楼，中级知识分子集中住了一栋楼。工人们戏谑地称这座楼是“熊猫楼”，是说这些知识分子戴眼镜的多，憨厚的形象确有点像可爱的熊猫，而且熊猫是国宝，知识分子也是国家的财富。厂里还规定，今后不论是外单位调入或内部晋升，凡是中级知识分子，一律分给两室一厨楼房。李子彬亲自出面，跑省、跑市，取得支持，用企业自然减员的指标，全部解决了他们待业子女的工作问题。对个别人的特殊困难，李子彬想方设法为他们分忧。一位工程师，夫妻二人都是南方人，岳母独自一人在家乡，瘫痪在床，生活不能自理，两人多次要求调回家乡。李子彬给其爱人特批了几个月的假期回去照顾老母，并表示希望能把她母亲接来，有困难厂里解决。这对夫妻和老人都很感动，到底把老人接来，厂里又给了一间房。他们表示要在锦化干一辈子。
    　　　　用才，要宽宏大量
    李子彬对待人才，从事业出发，不计个人恩怨。
    现在的总经济师王新生在担任基层干部时，一次当着众人的面指责李子彬，说总厂搞的合同很不像样子，“这叫合同？简直是逼着杨白劳写卖身契！”他拒不签字。开始李子彬对此人的直率感到吃惊。可他反思以后，觉得这个基层干部话说得虽然有点不恭，可合同确实有不完善的地方。修改后，王新生签了字，执行合同认真，超额完成了承包指标。李子彬认为王新生正直，有见解，有工作能力，把他选进了总厂领导班子。
    一位著名高等学府毕业的高材生与李子彬曾有过芥蒂。李子彬担任厂长后，那位同志思想特别消沉。可李子彬认为他基础知识扎实，有丰富的科研工作经验，打算提拔他为总厂技术负责人。有人说：“算了吧，提谁不行，你提他，人家听你的吗？别自找罪受了。”李子彬还是把那位同志提到了技术领导岗位，并晋升了工资。那位同志深受感动，工作奋力进取，使厂的科研攻关项目有了突破性的进展。
