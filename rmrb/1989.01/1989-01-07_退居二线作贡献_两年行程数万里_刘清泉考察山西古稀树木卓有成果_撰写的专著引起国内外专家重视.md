Liu Qingquan, a member of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, at the age of 67, spent two years from July 1986 to July 1988, traveling 15,000 kilometers, traversing mountains and rivers, and enduring hardships to investigate ancient and rare trees in Shanxi. He wrote the book "Ancient Trees of Shanxi," which has attracted the attention of domestic and foreign experts.

Liu Qingquan, who served as the director of the Shanxi Provincial Forestry Bureau for many years, is a renowned forestry expert in Shanxi. After retiring from his administrative position, he vowed to dedicate his life to the forestry industry of his country. Starting in July 1986, he traveled through 118 counties (cities) and 544 townships in Shanxi, visiting 772 villages to investigate and document the ancient and rare trees that have been growing there. He discovered a total of 1,429 ancient and rare trees belonging to 121 different species. These ancient trees include some with a long history (such as Zhou Dynasty locust trees and Qin Dynasty cypresses), some with rare species (such as red bean trees, camphor trees, and green sandalwoods that grow in subtropical regions), some with unique growth characteristics (such as a 1.2-meter-diameter, 10-meter-tall Chinese parasol tree and a 1.6-meter-diameter, 10-meter-tall hawthorn tree), and some that were planted by famous historical figures (such as a locust tree planted by Di Renjie of the Tang Dynasty and a tree planted by the patriotic general Feng Yuxiang). Some of these trees have stories associated with them.

Liu Qingquan's investigation of these ancient trees involved consulting local gazettes, seeking out county annals, searching for inscriptions, and visiting local residents to collect folklore. He accurately determined the age of the trees. He took over 5,000 photographs and collected numerous specimens of ancient tree seeds and tree fossils.

Liu Qingquan's investigation of ancient trees has significant value for the study of Shanxi's forestry, hydrology, geology, biology, climate, and ancient culture. It is particularly important for biological engineering, tree genetics, and tree planting.

Based on the extensive data he collected from his field investigations, Liu Qingquan wrote the 250,000-word book "Ancient Trees of Shanxi," which includes more than 1,100 precious photographs of ancient trees. Experts say that "Ancient Trees of Shanxi" is the first comprehensive study of ancient and rare trees in China. Former Minister of Forestry Luo Yuchuan read Liu Qingquan's manuscript and enthusiastically wrote a foreword, praising it as "a beautiful new flower in the world of forestry science." A forestry expert from Hesse, Germany, heard about Liu Qingquan's investigation of ancient trees and specially visited him in Taiyuan, saying, "I am the first subscriber to 'Ancient Trees of Shanxi.'" An American forestry expert also sent valuable materials as a "deposit" to obtain a copy of "Ancient Trees of Shanxi."

　　退居二线作贡献　两年行程数万里
    刘清泉考察山西古稀树木卓有成果
    撰写的专著引起国内外专家重视
    本报讯  记者王艾生报道：中共山西省顾委委员、６７岁的刘清泉，从１９８６年７月至１９８８年７月，历时两年，行程１．５万公里，跋涉山川，历经艰险，考察山西古稀珍贵树木，撰写出《山西古稀树木》一书，引起国内外专家重视。
    曾任山西省林业厅厅长多年的刘清泉，是山西省著名林业专家，退居二线后，立志要为祖国林业贡献毕生精力。从１９８６年７月起，他跋山涉水，走遍山西省的１１８个县（市）的５４４个乡镇，７７２个村庄，寻访，调查，考察迄今生长的古稀珍贵树木，终于查清这种珍贵树木共１４２９株（属于１２１个树种）。这些古稀树木有的年代久远（如有周代的槐树，秦代的柏树等），有的树种珍贵（如有生长在亚热带的红豆杉、连香树、青檀等），有的生长个性奇特（如有胸径１．２米、高１０米的文冠果，有胸径１．６米、高１０米的酸枣树），有的是历代名人栽的树木（如唐代狄仁杰栽的槐树，爱国将领冯玉祥栽的树）。有的树木记载着动人故事。
    刘清泉考察这些古稀树木，查府志，找县志，寻碑文，访民家，收集民间传说，准确地定出树的生长年代。他共拍摄５０００多幅照片，收集古稀树种、树木化石多件。
    刘清泉考察古稀树木对研究山西的林业、水文、地质、生物、气候以及古文化等都有重要价值。特别是对生物工程、树木遗传以及树木栽植等都有相当重要的意义。
    刘清泉依据实地考察所得的大量的资料，撰写了２５万字的《山西古稀树木》，内中提供极为珍贵的古稀树木照片１１００余幅。据专家们说，《山西古稀树木》一书，是迄今为止我国首部考察研究古稀珍贵树木的专著。原林业部部长罗玉川看了刘清泉的书稿，欣然为该书作序，并连连称赞说：“这是世界林业科学中又一朵艳丽的新花”，联邦德国黑森州的林业专家，听说刘清泉考察古稀树木，专程来太原拜访刘清泉，并说：“我是《山西古稀树木》的第一个订户。”美国的林业专家也寄来宝贵资料，作为索取《山西古稀树木》一书的“抵押”。
