International News Brief

	The PLO Condemns Israeli Attack on Camps
	The Palestine Liberation Organization on the 13th condemned Israel's air raids on Palestinian camps in southern Lebanon on the 11th and 12th, as well as the bloody suppression of Palestinians in the occupied territories.

	In a statement on the 13th, Yasser Abed Rabbo, the head of the PLO's Information Department, pointed out that Israel's repeated attacks on Palestinian camps and intensified repression in the occupied territories show that it has no intention of abandoning its policy of state terrorism.

	Thai Prime Minister Chatchai on Visit to Vietnam
	According to a report in a Bangkok newspaper on the 14th, Thai Prime Minister Chatchai Chunhawan said he would visit Vietnam after Vietnam withdraws all its troops from Cambodia. The report quoted Chatchai's remarks on the 13th, saying that the earlier Vietnam withdraws its troops from Cambodia, the earlier he would visit Vietnam.

	According to the report, Vietnam has invited Chatchai to visit, and Chatchai has accepted the invitation in principle.

	Canadian Foreign Minister Welcomes Soviet Peace Efforts
	Canadian Foreign Minister Joe Clark on the 13th said that the Soviet Union has taken steps towards achieving world peace and respecting human rights, such as withdrawing from Afghanistan, destroying SS-20 missiles, and attempting to ease tensions in Asia and Africa.

	He told students at the University of Calgary, "These steps not only indicate a change in policy but also reflect a profound change in the attitude of a regime towards its people."

	Returned Cuban Soldiers Resume Original Positions
	The Cuban National Commission for Labor and Social Security on the 13th announced that Cuban combatants returning from Angola will resume their original positions before leaving Cuba. The commission also stated that those who were students before joining the armed forces can continue their university studies or start working after a vacation.

	South Korean Ruling Party Member Arrested
	A current member of the ruling Democratic Justice Party in South Korea, Lee Hak-bong, was arrested by the prosecution on the 13th for alleged abuse of power and corruption. This is the first current member of the ruling party to be arrested since Roh Tae-woo took office. In 1985, during Chun Doo-hwan's rule, Lee used his position to pressure the Ministry of Finance to secure a loan of 26 billion South Korean won for a steel company, from which he obtained a large amount of political funds. He also used his position to interfere with inspection personnel investigating illegal operations by the South Korean Cold Storage Corporation.

	U.S. Judge Drops Two Charges Against North
	On the 13th, U.S. Federal Judge Gerhard Gesell dropped two charges against former National Security Advisor Oliver North in the Iran-Contra case.

	Gesell said that because the U.S. Attorney General believed that secret documents revealed by North during his trial could harm U.S. security interests, he had to drop the charges of "theft" and "conspiracy" against North. North was accused in the Iran-Contra affair of illegally diverting funds from the sale of U.S. weapons to Iran to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
