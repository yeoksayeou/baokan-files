	Old Case Revisited, Mysteries Remain Unsolved
	Bào Shìshào

	Twenty-six years ago on November 22, an event that shocked the world occurred in the United States: President Kennedy was assassinated! Recently, some major American media outlets have revisited the case, attempting to unravel the mysteries that have lingered in people's minds for over two decades. A photograph taken at the scene that year, reprinted, is particularly striking. The caption in the New York Times reads: "Soon after President Kennedy was shot, reporters stand in front of the Texas School Book Depository building. It was from here that the assassin, Harvey Oswald, fired the bullets." The newspaper, when reprinting the original caption, intentionally italicized the latter half of the sentence to indicate its skepticism about the authenticity of the photograph's description. It seems that people have posed new challenges to the Warren Commission's investigation report published in 1964.

	The Warren Commission was established under the instruction of President Johnson at the time. After 10 months of intense work, it interrogated 552 witnesses and had 27,000 conversations with relevant individuals, ultimately submitting a report of several hundred thousand words. The report concluded that Oswald assassinated Kennedy and Ruby killed Oswald, both acting alone. The commission did not find any evidence during the investigation that anyone had conspired with Oswald to carry out the assassination. As for the motive behind the assassination, the report stated that it was "impossible to make a definite determination." At the time, to dispel various speculations about the case, Voice of America broadcast the investigation report in 37 languages to the world. At the same time, it was printed into booklets and distributed by 228 American overseas institutions, totaling 25,000 copies. Despite this, doubts about the case did not disappear from people's minds. Instead, over the past 20-plus years, many people have continued to collect materials and analyze the Kennedy assassination case, making various new judgments.

	Young writer James Reston in his forthcoming book, "The Hope for John Connally" (to be published this year), cites extensive materials to show that the assassin Oswald's target was actually then-Texas Governor John Connally, not Kennedy. After returning from the Soviet Union to his hometown of Fort Worth, Oswald, having been disciplined by the navy, was left in disrepute, with local newspapers labeling him a "defector," making it impossible for him to find a job and support his wife and daughter. He had written to Connally, who was both a fellow townsman and then Secretary of the Navy, seeking his intervention to restore his reputation, but was rejected. From then on, Oswald harbored a grudge against Connally, which developed into the idea of assassinating Connally to vent his private anger... The author drew the conclusion from these facts that Oswald's assassination target was Connally, but Connally luckily was not hit in a vital spot, only injuring his ribs.

	The British Independent Television Company aired a documentary last October about the Kennedy assassination, refuting the Warren Commission's investigation report, asserting that at the time, among those who fired at Kennedy's car, Oswald was not the only assassin. The documentary includes a scene of a grassy knoll not far from Kennedy's car, asserting that a shooter fired at Kennedy from there. The director of the film also specifically cited the words of Gordon Arnold, a witness who was on the grassy knoll at the time, saying he had heard the sound of a bullet whizzing past his ear. Others have questioned, how could a single bullet kill Kennedy and injure Connally at the same time?!

	Some people believe that the assassin Oswald and Ruby, who later killed Oswald, both had dealings with Carlos Marcello, the head of the New Orleans mafia. The Kennedy administration at the time targeted the mafia as the main objective in its crackdown on criminal activities, thereby making the mafia see Kennedy as a thorn in their side, whom they had to remove. On the very morning of Kennedy's assassination, the local newspaper "Morning News" published a welcoming advertisement for him, which was strangely framed in black, making Kennedy sense an ominous foreboding. He told his wife with some bitterness, "Today, we are going to the madhouse!"

	Last November, a public opinion poll conducted by the New York Times and Columbia Broadcasting Company showed that 66% of respondents were skeptical of the Warren Commission's investigation report, believing that the assassination was a premeditated conspiracy and that the commission had intentionally covered up the truth, while only 13% completely believed the report. However, some political analysts believe that the Warren Commission's investigation report was the "simplest way to solve the problem." Since many people have raised numerous questions about the case, and now the more they analyze, the more questions arise, the American "Newsweek" pointed out that even if the government were to organize another investigation commission, it might not be able to uncover the truth behind Kennedy's assassination. This statement is not without reason. For most Americans, it is still hoped that the passage of time will dilute people's interest in this case.

　　旧案重提　疑团难解
    鲍世绍
    ２６年前的１１月２２日，美国发生了一件令人震惊的事件：肯尼迪总统遇刺身亡！近来，美国一些主要传播媒介旧案重提，试图揭破２０多年来人们心头的疑团。一张重新刊登的当年现场拍摄的照片特别引人注目，《纽约时报》的照片说明是：“肯尼迪总统遇刺不久，记者们站在得克萨斯教科书仓库大楼前。正是在这里，凶手哈维·奥斯华德的枪射出了子弹。”该报重登当年的说明时，特意把后半句排成斜体字，示意读者它对图片说明的真实性存疑。看来，人们对１９６４年９月沃伦调查委员会公布的调查报告提出了新的挑战。
    沃伦调查委员会当年是在美国总统约翰逊授意下成立的。经过１０个月的紧张工作，它先后审问了５５２个证人，同有关人员作了２．７万人次的谈话，最后提交了一份有数十万字的报告。该报告的结论是奥斯华德枪杀肯尼迪、鲁比枪杀奥斯华德都是单干的。委员会在调查中没有找到任何证据证明有任何人同奥斯华德策划和进行这次谋杀。至于谋杀动机，报告认为“无法明确作出断定”。当时为了平息对此案的种种猜测，《美国之音》用３７种语言向全世界播发了该调查报告。与此同时，它还被印成小册子，由２２８个美国驻外机构散发了２．５万册。尽管如此，有关案情的疑窦并没有在人们的头脑里消失。相反，在过去２０多年里，不少人仍在继续对肯尼迪被刺案收集材料、分析研究，作出了种种新的判断。
    青年作家詹姆斯·雷史敦在他的新著《对约·康纳利的祈望》（将于今年出版）中，引用大量材料说明，凶手奥斯华德射击的目标本是当时得克萨斯州州长约·康纳利，而并非肯尼迪。从苏联回到家乡沃斯堡的奥斯华德因受海军处分，落得个身败名裂，当地报纸称他为“变节分子”，因而找不到职业，也无力养活妻子和女儿。他曾写信请求既是同乡又是当时的海军部长康纳利出面干预，以便挽回声誉，但遭到拒绝，从此对康纳利产生仇恨，进而发展成暗杀康纳利以泄私愤的念头……作者从这些事实中得出结论，奥斯华德枪杀目标是对着康纳利，但康纳利侥幸没有被击中要害，只伤了肋骨。　
    英国独立电视公司去年１０月播放的一部有关肯尼迪遇刺实况的纪录片，推翻了沃伦委员会的调查报告，认为当时向肯尼迪的座车开枪射击者中，奥斯华德不是唯一的凶手。纪录片里有一个画面是当时离肯尼迪座车不远的一草地高坡，它断定有个射手就从那里向肯尼迪射出子弹。影片的编导还特地援引当时站在草地上的证人戈登·阿诺德的话，说他曾听到一颗子弹从他耳边掠过的声音。还有人反问，仅一颗子弹怎能同时打死肯尼迪又击伤康纳利呢？！
    另有一些人认为凶手奥斯华德和后来杀死奥斯华德的鲁比都与新奥尔良的黑手党头目卡洛斯·马塞罗有交往。肯尼迪政府当时把黑手党作为打击刑事犯罪活动的主要对象，从而招致黑手党人把肯尼迪看成眼中钉，非把他拔除不可。就在肯尼迪遇难当天早晨，当地报纸《早晨新闻》刊登一则欢迎他的广告竟特地加了黑框，这使肯尼迪预感到一种不祥之兆，他不无悻悻地对妻子说：“今天，我们去的是疯人区！”
    去年１１月，《纽约时报》和哥伦比亚广播公司举办的民意测验表明，６６％的人对沃伦委员会的调查报告持怀疑态度，认为这桩谋杀案是事先阴谋策划的，调查委员会有意把真相掩盖起来，只有１３％的人完全相信该报告。然而，也有些政治分析家认为，沃伦委员会的调查报告是“解决问题”最简便的办法。由于不少人曾对案件提出许多疑点，而现在越分析疑点又越多，美国《新闻周刊》对此指出，即使政府再组织一个调查委员会，也未必就能把肯尼迪遇刺真相查个水落石出。这种说法并非毫无道理。对于多数美国人来说，还是希望让时光的流水将人们对此案的兴趣冲淡吧！
