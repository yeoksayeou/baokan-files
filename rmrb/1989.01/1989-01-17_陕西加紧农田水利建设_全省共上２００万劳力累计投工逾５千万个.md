Shaanxi is accelerating agricultural water conservancy construction. The entire province has mobilized 2.119 million laborers, accumulating over 50.424 million man-days of work.

According to reports, "Compared to 1980, Shaanxi's agricultural water conservancy subsidies decreased by 62.8% in 1987, the largest reduction in the country. Therefore, from 1981 to 1985, the province's effective irrigated area decreased by 1.62 million mu. Although there has been some recovery in the past two years, it has not reached the highest level of the 1970s. Since 1985, grain production has stagnated for four consecutive years. Coupled with the uncontrolled population growth, Shaanxi has gone from being a self-sufficient province to a grain-deficient province. Recently, the Shaanxi Provincial Rural Work Conference was held, emphasizing the need to treat agriculture, which has been neglected, as a strategic issue affecting the overall situation, and strive for a bumper grain harvest this year.

The province's Water Resources and Soil Conservation Department reported that since last winter, agricultural water conservancy construction has shown signs of improvement. The labor force mobilized reached 2.119 million people, accumulating 50.424 million man-days of work. In northern Shaanxi, the focus is on small watershed management and the construction of "four types of fields" (terrace fields, dam fields, embankment fields, and water fields). By the end of November, before the big freeze, the tasks were completed ahead of schedule. In southern Shaanxi, while repairing water-damaged land, the focus is on strengthening water and soil conservation, promoting the construction of elevated fields. In the Guanzhong region, the focus is on the renovation of irrigation districts and the Wei River treatment project, which are currently being accelerated for completion.

　　陕西加紧农田水利建设
    全省共上２００万劳力累计投工逾５千万个
    本报讯  记者景险峰报道：“１９８７年同１９８０年相比，陕西农田水利补助费减少６２．８％，其幅度之大，为全国之冠。因此，从１９８１年到１９８５年，全省有效灌溉面积净减了１６２万亩。近两年虽有恢复，仍未达到７０年代的最高水平。１９８５年以来，粮食总产量连续４年徘徊不前，再加上人口增长出现了半失控，粮食由自给省又变成了缺粮省。前不久召开的陕西省农村工作会议，要求把被冷落了的农业真正当作事关全局的战略问题严肃加以对待，争取今年的粮食丰收。
    据该省水利水土保持厅介绍，去冬以来，全省农田水利基本建设出现了起色，投入的劳力达２１１．９万人，累计投工５０４２．４万个。陕北侧重小流域治理和“四田”（梯田、坝地、埝地、水地）建设，１１月底大冻以前已超额完成任务。陕南在抓好水毁地修复的同时，以加强水土保持治理为目标，大兴抬田修地。关中地区以灌区整修和渭河治理工程为重点，目前正在加紧完成。
