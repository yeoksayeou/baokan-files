The book "Whole Wind Learning at the Central Party School in Yan'an" has recently been published by the Central Party School Press with the approval of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

Peng Zhen wrote a preface for this book, which reflects the rectification movement at the Central Party School in Yan'an.

The book "Whole Wind Learning at the Central Party School in Yan'an" collects some speeches by the school's leaders that have never been published before, as well as self-criticisms by students during their study sessions at that time.

In the preface he wrote for this book, Comrade Peng Zhen said: "At the time of the publication of this collection of historical materials, I propose that comrades take the time to read it. Old comrades can review our party's historical experiences and provide corrections and supplements, while new comrades can familiarize themselves with the experiences of the Yan'an rectification study and some of our party's fine traditions from this book."
