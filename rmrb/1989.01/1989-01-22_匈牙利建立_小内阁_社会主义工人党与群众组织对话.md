Hungary Establishes "Small Cabinet"
	Socialist Workers' Party and Mass Organizations in Dialogue

New China News Agency, Budapest, January 20th - In order to improve its work, Hungary has decided to establish a "small cabinet" within the government.

The party's central organ, the "People's Freedom Daily," reported today that this "small cabinet" consists of 6 people: the Prime Minister, Vice Prime Minister, two State Ministers, the Minister of the Interior, and the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Relevant ministers can participate in the meetings when the "small cabinet" discusses issues.

The "small cabinet" is not a decision-making body. Its task is to delve deeply into discussions on government policies in the areas of economics, welfare, and culture, as well as to study strategic issues.

New China News Agency, Budapest, January 20th - Representatives of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the mass organization Hungarian Democratic Forum held a dialogue here today, explaining their respective political positions.

During the dialogue, the two sides discussed issues such as political unity, the establishment of a democratic political system, the role of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, and the possibility of political pluralism.
