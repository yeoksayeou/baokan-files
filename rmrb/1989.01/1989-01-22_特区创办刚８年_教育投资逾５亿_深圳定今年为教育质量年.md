The development of the educational sector has already played a decisive role in the modernization and outward-oriented economic development of the Shenzhen Special Zone. Recently, Li Huo, Secretary of the Shenzhen Municipal Committee, made this appeal to the people of Shenzhen from all walks of life.

Once dubbed an "educational desert," Shenzhen, in its eight years of establishment, has invested over 500 million yuan in education. The municipal government's investment in education has increased by an average of over 50% each year. Last year, the total educational investment in the city reached 155.47 million yuan, of which 94.6 million yuan was allocated to educational affairs, a 60.5% increase from 1987. The total educational investment accounted for 13.64% of the total fiscal expenditure, higher than the provincial average of 12.67% and the national average of 11.22%.

According to statistics, Shenzhen currently has 52 middle schools and 257 primary schools. Within the Special Zone, 17 middle schools and 36 primary schools have been equipped with standard teaching instruments as per the guidelines issued by the State Education Commission. Additionally, 15 schools and kindergartens have established computer rooms.

However, local officials believe that the educational sector in the Shenzhen Special Zone is not keeping pace with the city's rapid economic development. Currently, the number and quality of talents cultivated by various schools, as well as their specifications and structures, are to varying degrees, out of sync with the needs of the city's economic development.

Shenzhen has formulated measures to make 1989 the "Year of Educational Quality." Simultaneously, the city aims to make the Special Zone's education sector "open, experimental, and of high standards." Therefore, starting this year, a certain proportion of the municipal fiscal surplus will be allocated as special educational funds to purchase teaching instruments and improve the teaching environment.

　　特区创办刚８年　教育投资逾５亿    
    深圳定今年为教育质量年
    本报深圳１月２１日电  记者王楚报道：“教育事业的发展，已在决定深圳特区现代化建设和外向型经济的进程。”日前，深圳市委书记李灏向深圳各界人士发出这一呼吁。
    一度被人们称为“教育沙漠”的深圳，创办８年，教育总投资已超过５亿元。市政府对教育投资平均每年递增５０％以上。去年，全市教育总投资已达１．５５４７亿元，其中教育事业费占９４６０万元，比１９８７年增长６０．５％，全市教育投资数占财政总支出的１３．６４％，高于广东省平均数１２．６７％和全国的１１．２２％。
    据统计，深圳市现有中学５２所、小学２５７所，其中特区内已有１７所中学和３６所小学按国家教委颁布一类标准，配置了常规教学仪器，１５所中小学和幼儿园建立了电脑室。
    但是，此间有关人士认为，深圳特区教育事业很不适应全市经济建设的高速发展。从现状看，各类学校对人才培养，无论数量、质量，还是规格、结构，都不同程度地与全市经济发展的需要相脱节。
    深圳市已制订措施，把１９８９年作为“教育质量年”，同时，力争把特区教育办得具有“开放性、试验性和高标准”特点。因此，从今年起，每年市财政超收部分，有一定比例拨作专项教育经费，用于学校购置教学仪器，改善教学环境。
