Those who study history must base their work on meticulous historical materials. In recent years, with the development of historical thought, people have paid more attention to the accumulation, organization, and retrieval of historical materials, and several reference books on this topic have emerged. In terms of contemporary history, there are various annuals for accumulating materials; for convenient retrieval of materials, there are various chronicles and timelines of major events. "Chronicle of Major Events in Contemporary China" is another type of reference book.

"Chronicle of Major Events in Contemporary China" is entirely based on publicly released domestic materials, starting from 1949 and edited in installments. From what I have seen of a few volumes, it has two characteristics. First, it is relatively systematic. Within a certain period, it is organized by category, allowing readers to see at a glance the major events that occurred during that time and their interconnections. Second, the records are relatively detailed, with both the beginning and the end covered. For example, the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, it excerpted Mao Zedong's fundamental assessment of China's national conditions. Now everyone is studying the theory of the primary stage of socialism. If we review Mao Zedong's analyses and assessments before the founding of the country, it may be enlightening. Again, in 1956, the Dalai Lama and Panchen Lama were invited to India to participate in the 2500th anniversary of the Parinirvana of Sakyamuni. At that time, how the separatist elements plotted to take advantage of the opportunity to rebel, how Mao Zedong assessed the situation, how the central authorities made decisions, how Zhou Enlai worked during his visit to India, how Panchen Lama understood the situation, and how the Dalai Lama returned to Tibet at that time, all are documented according to the documents. Some events also have appendices, such as the 1949 negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communists. In addition to excerpting Zhou Enlai's report, it also includes appendices of Zhang Zhizhong and Li Zongren's memoirs, so that readers can understand the historical situation from different angles.

The book's understanding of "major events" is relatively broad. The ancients said that the minor affairs of a county are the major affairs of the people. This book has the same meaning. Returning the remains of Genghis Khan, which were taken away by the Kuomintang, to Inner Mongolia is a major event for ethnic minorities. The negotiations regarding the skull of Master Xuanzang are a major event in the religious community. The heroic troops who liberated Shanghai and slept on the streets were a major event that moved people's hearts and was famous both domestically and internationally. From the perspective of preserving China's cultural heritage, the contributions of Beijing's old book industry should not be underestimated; from the perspective of safe production, the two major fires in Heilongjiang in 1953 should be taken as a lesson. The book pays attention to historical events from various aspects and levels, which not only helps to reflect the overall picture of history but also expands its readership because it is useful for people in various industries.

The materials of contemporary Chinese history are vast. A comprehensive and systematic organization like this book can be said to be a new attempt. Judging from its attitude of seriousness, careful selection of materials, and ability to attract readers, this attempt may be successful, so I am happy to write a preface for it.

(The book will be published by Hunan People's Publishing House)

　　《当代中国大事编年》序
    黎澍遗作
    研究历史的人必须把工作建立在翔实的史料的基础上。近年来，随着史学思想的发展，人们更注意到史料的积累、整理和检索，出现了一些有关的工具书。以当代史而论，积累资料的，有各种年鉴；便于检索资料的，有各种大事记、大事年表。《当代中国大事编年》是另一类型的工具书。
    《当代中国大事编年》完全以国内公开发表的资料为根据，自１９４９年起，分期编辑。就我看到的几卷来说，它有两个特点。一是较为系统。在一段时期之内，按类编排，使读者一目了然，知道当时发生了哪些重大事件，彼此有何联系。一是记述较详，本末俱备。如七届二中全会，就摘录了毛泽东关于中国国情的根本估计。现在大家都在研究社会主义初级阶段的理论，如果回顾一下建国前夕毛泽东的这些分析和估计，可能会有所启发。又如１９５６年达赖、班禅应邀赴印度参加释迦牟尼涅槃二千五百年纪念，当时分裂主义分子如何阴谋趁机叛乱，毛泽东如何估计，中央如何决策，周恩来访印时如何做工作，班禅如何深明大义，达赖当时如何返藏，均据文献一一交代，有些事件还有附录，如１９４９年国共和谈，除摘述周恩来的报告外，还附录张治中和李宗仁的回忆，以便读者从不同角度了解当时历史情况。
    本书对于“大事”的理解，较为广泛。古人说过，州县的小事，百姓的大事，本书也有此意。把国民党劫走的成吉思汗的灵柩运回内蒙古，在少数民族是一件大事。关于玄奘法师头顶骨的交涉，在宗教界是一件大事。解放了大上海的英雄部队露宿在马路上，曾是激动人心蜚声中外的大事。从保存中国文化遗产的角度来看，北京旧书业的功绩未可低估；从安全生产的角度来看，１９５３年黑龙江两次特大火灾早当记取。本书能够注意到多方面多层次的历史事件，既有助于反映历史的全貌，也使它的读者范围随之扩大，因为它对各行各业的人都有用处。
    当代中国史料浩繁，像本书这样做全面的系统的整理，可说是一种新的尝试。观其态度谨严，取材精审，尚能引人入胜，这种尝试可能是成功的，故乐为之序。
