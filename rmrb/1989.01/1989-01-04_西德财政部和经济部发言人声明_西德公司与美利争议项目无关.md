West German Federal Finance Ministry and Economy Ministry spokesmen said in Bonn today that it is not yet possible to determine whether any West German chemical companies have participated in the construction of a chemical weapons factory in Libya.

West German government deputy spokesman Scheffer said in Bonn today that the U.S. government had expressed doubts during West German Chancellor Kohl's visit to the U.S. on November 15 last year, suggesting that some West German companies might have been involved in the construction of a chemical weapons factory in Libya. Recent U.S. newspaper reports have also carried similar news.

According to Scheffer, after Kohl's visit to the U.S., relevant West German authorities immediately investigated three chemical enterprises suspected of violating West German foreign economic laws, including the West German Imhausen Chemical Company, which was named in U.S. newspaper reports. The Finance Ministry spokesman said, "There is no evidence to suggest" that the company "violated foreign economic laws."

Imhausen Chemical Company Chairman Hippenstiel reiterated today on Deutsche Welle that his company is not involved in this controversial project in Libya and that his company does not possess the patents necessary for the production of chemical weapons.

　　西德财政部和经济部发言人声明
    西德公司与美利争议项目无关
    新华社波恩１月２日电  西德联邦财政部和经济部发言人今天在波恩说，到目前为止还不能确定西德是否有化学公司参与了利比亚一家化学武器工厂的建造工作。
    西德政府副发言人舍费尔今天在波恩说，美国政府曾在去年１１月１５日西德总理科尔访美时表示怀疑，说可能有西德公司参与了利比亚一家化学武器工厂的建造工作。最近美国报纸也报道了类似的消息。
    据舍费尔说，科尔访美后，西德有关机构立即调查涉嫌违反西德对外经济法的３家化工企业，其中包括被美国报纸点名的西德伊姆豪森化学公司。据财政部发言人说，“没有根据可以说明”这家公司“违反了对外经济法”。
    伊姆豪森化学公司董事长希彭施蒂尔今天在德意志电台重申，他的公司同利比亚这一有争议的项目毫不相干，他的公司也不具备生产化学武器所必需的专利。
