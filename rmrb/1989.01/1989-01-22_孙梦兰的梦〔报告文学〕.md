At the intersection of the North Suburb Road leading to the Asian Games Village, there stands a peculiar countdown board—721 days. Less than two years remain until the opening of the Asian Games.

This vast and dazzling construction site is a spectacle to behold. The gray concrete structures are sprouting like bamboo shoots after a rain, with 25-story athlete apartments, luxurious international postal and telecommunications centers, and thermal hubs. The total construction area is 1.44 million square meters, and 20,000 workers from the Beijing Housing Construction Company are working day and night. It may be difficult to determine the exact occupancy of each building now, but by the autumn of 1990, it will transform into a bustling world filled with flowers, cars, and crowds. However, it is puzzling that the construction site seems unusually quiet, unlike the usual scenes of bustling activity and fervor.

The chief engineer of the North Suburb project for the Asian Games, Lin Jinyu, told me that the project is in crisis. There is a shortage of cement and steel, and the speculators have caused a three-month halt, resulting in a daily loss of 250,000 yuan. If this continues, the Asian Games might have to be held elsewhere!

Just before National Day, as the gold medal competition in Seoul reached its climax, Sun Menglan, the general manager and legal representative of the company, suddenly fell ill and was hospitalized. He had a cold, pneumonia, and a high fever, and he refused to see visitors. Some said this was due to excessive stress, a "professional illness"; others said it was just a coincidence and there was no need to make a fuss...

He, unaware of the outside world's chatter, had already fallen into a deep, hazy dream. Perhaps his entire life had been a series of dreams—dreaming of orchids blooming, dreaming of jade palaces rising from the ground, dreaming of sweet dew falling from the sky, drop by drop, two drops, three drops... Oh, that's the drip of the intravenous tube. This dream was not pleasant; his scorching brain was filled with battles over cement, steel, and prices. The walls were gray, the lights were yellow, and his mind was filled with indistinct images—joy, sorrow, long journeys, endless horizons. So, he slowly closed his heavy eyelids, allowing the plot of his dream to unfold freely, giving full rein to his imagination. How rare it was; perhaps only when lying in a hospital bed could he find a moment of relaxation and freedom, to savor the path of life...

No one here had seen him at the age of 15. During the southward advance of the army, the daughter of a landlord from Fuping County, Hebei Province, joined the Communist Party to fight for revolution and to survive. Fortunately, at that time, family background was not strictly scrutinized; as long as one worked hard, the door to serving the people was open. Eight years passed, and the "old builders" probably still remember that during the call for "developing productive forces" at the 8th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in 1957, there was a small reform. At that time, Sun Menglan was already the section chief of the Third Construction Company of Beijing. This young man, full of vigor, wanted to showcase his ambitions and boldly tried the full responsibility system of team management, subcontracting, and material supply in the small project of Xi Yuan Yi Mu Garden Primary School. Unexpectedly, this 300-square-meter project created a miracle, with efficiency increasing severalfold and many problems being solved. This clever trick was quickly noticed by his superiors and began to be promoted as the "Xi Yuan Yi Mu Garden" experience throughout the city.

A remedy for treating egalitarianism, the fact itself had already proven its vitality, and it was also the first bud of reform. Unfortunately, it was born at the wrong time, 20 years ahead of the eventual implementation of the contract responsibility system. At the high-level political conference held in Beidaihe in the spring of 1958, Beijing was criticized for promoting capitalist material incentives, which was a serious matter. To protect the higher-ups and pass the inspection, people had to hide the relevant materials. Just as the materials were hidden, the call for the Great Leap Forward sounded. Sun Menglan sighed, "That was such a good omen, and it was aborted. This delay was not a big deal, but our current site management still cannot catch up with the level of that time!"

Of course, as the person responsible for the mistake, he could only reflect and repent, sitting silently on the section chief's chair for 8 years, losing all energy for progress. When the Cultural Revolution storm came, he naturally became the most qualified target—an accomplice of the capitalist roaders, a dog's offspring, a black seed of revisionism, and a class enemy. People specially held an exhibition for "Xi Yuan Yi Mu Garden," performed street plays, painted their noses to look like clowns, and finally expelled him from the party and put him under supervision. During the struggle against Zhang Baifu at Beijing Third Construction Company, he was often taken along, but the "royalists" who sent dumplings to Zhang Baifu did not include him, because he was not qualified enough to be a "labor traitor," but a mixed-blood infiltrator into the workers' ranks. Zhang Baifu, locked in the same room, complained, "I was only the manager for a dozen days and became a reactionary." Sun Menglan was a bit resentful: "You are not wronged, but I haven't even had a day's worth of enjoyment!"

Sun Menglan, with a heart full of grievances, was exiled to the construction site of the Second Automobile Factory in Shiyan, Hubei Province. His first major setback in life, his ambition to achieve something turned into a dark nightmare, and he vented his frustration by digging soil.

Another eight years passed, and the Second Automobile Factory project was completed. Upon returning to Beijing, he encountered another nightmare, the "counterattack against the rightist reversal of verdicts" crushed the faint hope that had just emerged. So many scars, repeatedly twisted and tormented, he originally planned to disappear from the world, to be a compliant citizen who earns money to support his family. However, the harsh reality often shook his conscience. Looking around the familiar streets of the capital after many years, what did he see? Economic stagnation and production decay left behind dark, makeshift buildings and outdated municipal facilities; severe housing shortages caused homeless people to fight for every square meter of living space; the apartment buildings in Qianmen had been standing for nearly a year but were still in darkness... Compared to the outside, it was even more chilling. The regions and countries that were originally behind us in technical and economic indicators had caught up and even surpassed us, not to mention the industrial powers that had left us far behind in the museum corner. In the mid-1970s, the average annual output per construction worker was 100 square meters in the United States, 80 in Japan, 60 in the Soviet Union, and only 20 in China, and that was low-cost construction. When others were building 100-story skyscrapers with steel structures and lightweight panels, we were still lingering in the miserable state of using large amounts of Qin bricks and Han tiles, manual masonry, and shoulder-carrying. Materials, technology, management, production efficiency, organizational measures, mechanized construction—it was like a pile of sand, headache treated with aspirin, foot pain treated with pain-relieving plasters. What disease did Chinese construction have? Why did it still linger in the scientific achievements of the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods?

Sun Menglan stood on the scaffolding of the Chongwen Hotel under construction and could not help but shed tears of indignation. Yes, he always liked to climb high and look far, because the boundless horizon could give him the power and courage. Could it be that just because of personal grievances, he would give up his lifelong ambition and belief of "building a thousand rooms to shelter the people"? That would be too weak and selfish! However, the wrinkles had already crept onto his forehead, and he had become wiser and more experienced in the wind and rain. He remembered the "Xi Yuan Yi Mu Garden" 20 years ago, knowing that the current social background still did not allow for running wild, so he went to a remote place, far from the city, where there were few flies, and used a small amount of activity space to start from scratch again, reliving the old dream of a doer. In this factory far from the city, he avoided interference as much as possible, and the products were simple, but it was a production preparation base for advanced construction methods, which could provide strong support for the frontline.

This unknown factory director worked for another eight years! No one knows how many nights he spent planning and scheming, using all his strength to turn this chronically loss-making mess into a profitable enterprise. It was the great turning point in history that brought him luck this time, and the tragedy of "Xi Yuan Yi Mu Garden" was not repeated. While others were still hesitating on the starting line, this unprofitable factory took the lead, turning losses into profits, creating a record of 64 million yuan in annual profits, and hanging up the banner of an advanced enterprise. Before Sun Menglan left his post, party members and workers unanimously elected him as a representative of the Beijing Municipal Party, a district people's representative, and a model worker.

"I don't have a panacea. If you ask me what I have learned, it is that I am willing to work hard, see clearly, grasp firmly, not believe in superstitions, and dare to fight," he said with a faint smile. It seems that it was precisely because of this tenacious, unyielding, unconcerned with honor and disgrace, and willing to sit on the cold bench spirit that Sun Menglan was able to stand out after "fighting for eight years" in the wallboard factory and charge into a new world with a broader vision. In 1983, to accelerate the solution to the urgent housing problem and to prevent the dispersal of forces to build projects and buildings, Beijing decided to establish a specialized housing construction company, and Sun Menglan was appointed as the deputy general manager. His dreams were getting bigger and bigger.

The current situation is daunting. Agricultural reform has achieved remarkable results, and township enterprises are thriving, which is like replaying a historical drama of the countryside surrounding the cities in the economic field. The construction industry, which has inherited many guild customs from the old times and has long been accustomed to the labor methods of small-scale handicraft producers, where is the way out for reform? The newly established units are in a mess, how to sort out the threads and make them effectively undertake the heavy task of building houses for Beijing people? A series of worries flashed by, and Sun Menglan seemed to suddenly grasp a bright spot: this opportunity is very rare, precisely because the new unit has not yet formed a heavy inertial force, the direction of the starting point not only has a lot of room for choice, but also can save effort! It must be tried, how to use advanced means to operate the construction industry, how to give full play to the advantages of large enterprises. I don't believe that a company of tens of thousands of people, with a large number of high-level talents, skilled workers, and complete equipment, cannot defeat the peasants' big knives and spears.

The preciousness of this opportunity also lies in the fact that Sun Menglan happened to be in charge of personnel and labor production. Everything starts with people, and laziness is the root of all evils. Since he had the power, he decided to cut into personnel first.

The hundred-yuan output value wage content and the square meter quota contract are experiences from other units, let's try them first. This immediately hooked the workers' pockets to the value of the products. Some people say that the word "material incentive" was created by Khrushchev and is not pleasant to hear, but distribution according to labor is genuine socialism. In the past, when they were wildly criticizing revisionism, what happened? Construction workers created a new term—pay according to contribution!

However, Sun Menglan quickly discovered that "incentives" are not omnipotent. There is a folk song that says construction workers "look like a group of refugees from afar, and like beggars up close." In the 1980s, Beijing youth had bigger appetites, and selling hard labor for more money lost its appeal. Indeed, there are many ways to make easy money in big cities, why bother to go to the piles of bricks, tiles, and sand to suffer? This labor and personnel deputy manager suddenly realized the four-faced siege, old workers injured and retired, young and strong laborers hard to recruit, technical talents in short supply. He finally realized that it was no longer the era of "Xi Yuan Yi Mu Garden" and the wallboard factory, the simple relationship between labor and capital had changed, urban youth were rushing towards high-tech development and market profits, and the urban-rural gap was triggering a second wave of population migration. Face reality, this is the living soul of Marxism.

So, Sun Menglan boldly did something unprecedented, issuing a notice titled "Reform of the Labor System," actually to save the urgent situation, opening the back door to recruit a large number of migrant workers, after a short training, immediately go to work to replace them. Earn more money and be able to live in the city for a few days, stroll around the flowery world, what a great temptation for farmers who have been living in the countryside for generations. Tens of thousands of young men rushed to the construction site like a tide, obedient, willing to learn skills, and enthusiastic about labor, much better than those annoying Beijingers. However, the labor department was not lenient, catching the illegal and disorderly hand on the spot, the current policy does not allow contract workers to enter the city, issuing a warning to withdraw within a limited time. Sun Menglan replied: "I recruit workers with my right hand and hold the document with my left hand, this is reasonable but illegal. If Beijing people do not want to live in houses, if the children of the labor bureau director are willing to be bricklayers, I will immediately dismiss the migrant workers." The lawsuit became bigger and bigger, and he won! The new document was circulated nationwide, the initiator broke the deadlock, and now 60% of the frontline construction workers in Beijing are migrant contract workers.

However, Sun Menglan's vision was even further, this was not a fundamental solution to improve the quality of personnel, relying solely on primary labor force was not enough to welcome the high-tech era. He said: "In recent years, society has been obsessed with so-called short-term behavior, doing business to make a quick buck and run, township enterprises distributing profits, officials using their power for personal gain. State-owned enterprises also have ways, new officials lighting three fires, competing for equipment and inventory, giving more benefits and bonuses, leaving a good reputation. This is not surprising, in the sea of officials, who knows what the next day will bring, grabbing the advantage is considered grabbing the advantage. But I thought, Sun Wukong with 72 transformations, in the end, taking the scripture still could not do without Sun Wukong, this battle of talents must be a long-term war, absolutely not to do the evil of killing the chicken to take the eggs." He once again took the lead, starting to select a large number of in-service personnel, sending them to colleges and universities for targeted further study. This matter shocked the Housing Construction Company and made the colleagues in the Beijing construction industry gasp in surprise. Those who were formerly Red Guards, went to the countryside, self-taught talents, as long as they had a certain cultural foundation and the desire to study, after passing the assessment, they were all sent out in batches. The more capable they were, the better they performed, the more they were sent out early. In Sun Menglan's words, first, be willing to spend money, second, be willing to send people, in three years, a total of more than 1,000 people were sent out, to the extent that it was difficult to recruit qualified students from within the company. So he changed his tactic again, commissioning professional colleges and universities with high professional levels, such as Tsinghua University, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing Institute of Civil Engineering and Architecture, and Nanjing Institute of Technology, to enroll one more class of students in Beijing, and return them in full after graduation. The price paid for this was considerable, and some of the exchange conditions were even harsh. According to Deputy General Manager Lin Jinyu, each student had to pay more than 150,000 yuan, and the total training fee reached several thousand yuan!

Such a novel thing naturally would not be smooth sailing, people said "the managers are 'showing off,' using our blood and sweat to support the idle young masters," "those who do the work have gone to study, the technical department has become a vacuum," "only diplomas are fragrant." Sun Menglan sighed: "I don't know how many curses I endured to get through it, now that the students have returned, they have become technical and management backbone, playing a big role, and people have begun to understand what talent development, intellectual investment, and emotional investment are." And when those who originally held skeptical attitudes are now worried about the lack of mid-to-high-level professional talents and anxious to snatch talented university graduates, General Manager Sun cannot help but secretly rejoice: I did not misjudge the situation, taking the curses was worth it!

It was precisely because of the rapid formation of a high-quality standing army that the Housing Construction Company had the mature conditions to realize the comprehensive reform of the cadre system, implementing the full implementation of the assessment and appointment system and the optimization of the labor combination system. The accompanying democratic evaluation, personnel transparency, and openness have gradually become part of the daily life of the public here. This annual performance appraisal form designed by Sun Menglan, with countless lines, adopts anonymous secret voting, and is also effective for him. The hard lines on the paper are cutting off the old history of Chinese enterprises characterized by nepotism and eating from the same big pot, opening up a fair and talented labor era for people. When I privately visited the site, the most prominent feeling was that the cadres were working hard and in an orderly manner, treating people with professionalism and courtesy, and taking responsibility, almost no idle people could be seen. It is said that in the past few years, more than six or seven hundred cadres have been eliminated.

"Ten years have passed—" Sun Menglan drew out his voice and said, "generally speaking, the reform of the construction industry has shown initial results, and it is now in a stalemate. When I took over as general manager in 1986, I had a premonition that the reform would be difficult to deepen, because the old production relations had shackled the productive forces, and the existing system restricted us from giving full play to the maximum economic benefits. The defects of the hundred-yuan output value wage content system have already emerged, gradually evolving into output value as the leader, sacrificing actual benefits for more money. On the other hand, our scientific and economic talents have already possessed the high-efficiency comprehensive service strength, but are still slaves to output value, and the contract is only a simple construction service. For example, the brain controls the hand to complete coordinated actions, but now the brain is on someone else's body, only using our two hands, the whole body loses its subject consciousness. Originally, it was to solve the problem of the separation of government and enterprise that the original management bureau was changed into a company, but this company has not been able to transform into an independent economic entity for a long time. Not giving a business license, not allowing free participation in market competition and the most profitable economic activities, only playing the role of assigning tasks to subordinate construction companies and supervising production, is it not changing the soup but not the medicine, going back to the old path of government functions? You know, I am now the general manager, using state-owned funds to do business, not an administrative official, and not a labor broker who sells labor. Why do I say this? It is necessary to briefly explain the little-known, long-implemented basic construction system: the project owner who has reported to the state and obtained approval and budget funds is called the first party, then in sequence to the planning bureau, real estate bureau, and many other bureaus to apply for land allocation, land acquisition or purchase, and handle many complex matters such as demolition, employment of farmers, property rights demarcation, etc. Then entrust the various professional design institutes called the third party to draw the drawings, including equipment, buildings, and construction, road opening, water and heating, electricity, etc. After that, according to the contract price, the construction task is handed over to the construction company, called the second party. After the house is completed, it is divided into the second party of road, water, and electricity municipal companies to dig trenches, lay lines, connect and test loads; finally, other departments are invited to plant trees, open shops, build schools, and even police stations, neighborhood committees, and parking lots must be worshipped, otherwise you can't move in. From this, it can be seen that the process is long and the checkpoints are many, as long as a small official catches a cold, you can do nothing about it. The reason why there are many unfinished projects, "ghost buildings," and "black buildings" across the country, which have not been completed for many years or have been completed for many years but are still dark and cold, lacking water and heat, is mostly related to this "software" being too soft. In advanced industrial countries, this is no longer the case. A large company takes on the overall contract, from the beginning of buying land to the end of greening, by various subsidiary companies to undertake projects, or one party to handle all the procedures, buy collective tickets without queuing, and when the time comes, just give the business owner a key to the door, and everything is done. This is what is called the "turnkey project," translated from "turnkey bid," and the intermediate-level English course "Winning the Championship" on CCTV talks about its bidding process. In fact, the Soviet Union had long established a similar total contracting enterprise organization, called a trust. This integrated approach is beneficial to both the first and second parties, unified arrangement, internal coordination, shortened cycle, reduced disputes, improved benefits, and everyone is happy. It's just that the Chinese are too bound by tradition, and the official-business tradition is difficult to change, so far only watching from outside the wall.

"You have not been in the construction industry for nothing, what you said is quite reasonable." Sun Menglan said with a few traces of illness on his face, smiling. "I want to do is that kind of one-stop enterprise, but China has its own national conditions, it will not be copied exactly. We once overly emphasized that the smaller the enterprise, the better, but using township enterprises to fit large companies, it negates the advantages of being large. Without a national team, who will go to the Olympics? This small peasant economy view is difficult to change for the time being, so it is not possible to reach the ideal scale in one step, we only call ourselves the 'leading enterprise,' that is, an industrial group with a leading enterprise as the backbone, also a Chinese characteristic."

"To reduce the resistance of the transition," he said, "I have made long-term preparations for personnel and decision-making, studied and formulated plans, and planned to carry out a spontaneous action from the bottom up. However, as soon as it was unveiled, it encountered objections, so I had to start doing it semi-publicly. Fortunately, it happened to encounter the approval of Zhao Ziyang and Li Peng to promote the experience of Lubuge nationwide, saving me! The Ministry of Construction only then discovered that we had a group of enterprises that were already in the embryonic form of dark horses, and in the summer, we finally obtained legal status and were honored to wear the 'leading' hat..."

Not much time has passed, and it is too early to draw conclusions now. Sun Menglan has been dreaming this beautiful dream for more than a year, what has he done?

The new system has emerged from the decades-old framework, the enterprise has transformed from a management type to an operating type, from an extensive type to an intensive type, and from a labor-intensive type to an intelligence-intensive type. The mechanism of one-stop service from clearing the site, design, scientific research, procurement, construction to handing over the key has begun to operate. The management layer and the operation layer have been separated, changing from block management to project management, that is, the 100-plus project contractors in the enterprise are no longer administrative subordinates, but executors of contractual agreements, they must be responsible to the users to the end, and in the future, if the house leaks, they will have to go and fix it.

This leading company is now carrying out the business of comprehensive real estate development, the 810 project of the Asian Games and the new Soviet embassy have been successfully tested; the Asian Games North Suburb Postal and Telecommunications Center has been completed ahead of schedule due to the implementation of project management. The total company has increased its output value by 18% in the comprehensive adjustment in recent years, the completed area has increased by 10% per year, the per capita output value is 140,000 yuan, and the completed residential area has accounted for 39% of the total planned amount of large state-owned construction in Beijing, with an annual output value of 600 million yuan.

The more famous Beijing Likan Roast Duck Restaurant and Likan Moving Company are the third industry services for its enterprise body. The current Likan Group has developed into tourism, hotels, moving, construction decoration, and furniture repair and other diversified operations, becoming a famous labor service pearl in Beijing. Originally, it was just to absorb surplus personnel and children of employees, but Sun Menglan never neglected or discriminated against it, giving the most preferential treatment in terms of funds, talents, and business guidance, and finally it became a big deal. Today, it can create the output value of several thousand construction workers, and in return, it has won market and reputation for the enterprise body. The "low profit, high turnover, and service to the door" spirit of Likan, which Beijing people love to talk about, has inspired two scripts of the same name, "Duck Knocking on the Door," one is Peking opera, and the other is a TV series, which will be released soon.

What is Sun Menglan thinking about now? Go out of Beijing! Hainan Development Company, Tongxian Development Company, and Likan branch stores set up in selected locations, this is domestic. Zaire Sports Stadium, Mobutu's Presidential Villa... The next target, the ceasefire between Iran and Iraq, the Middle East market is beckoning, this is overseas. Cooperation with Hong Kong Dehong Company to establish a decoration company, cooperation with the French Polaris Group to build a financial building, this is a joint venture. The Chinese construction team has good quality, is hardworking, has low wages, and is reputable, and overseas people have praised it unanimously. Such superior competitive conditions, such rich labor resources, why not go out and have a try, why not enter the global cycle?!

Wait a minute, the road to realizing the dream is full of dangers!

"We have paid a heavy price for every step we have taken." Sun Menglan said painfully, "Do you know, we are now illegal households. The enterprise function has changed, but the vertical leadership system has not changed, still using the old policy to take my pulse, the internal system is still not separated from government and enterprise, and the external system is chaotic and disorderly. You want to get a turnkey project, the business owners do not recognize the real person, but still cut the process of building a house into segments, and dare not cross the line. The dual-track pricing of materials, the speculators have caused us great suffering, because we have no right to set up a raw material base for joint ventures, the prospect is bleak. The day before I was hospitalized, a certain foreign-related hotel in Beijing said that it could use dollars to buy their cement, the price was so high that it was terrifying. Can a hotel produce cement? But the Asian Games project is stuck in the hands of these uncles, even the matter related to national face is ruthless! As for the overseas market, it is even more disheartening, not allowing us to find food by ourselves, the project must be put in someone else's pocket, after layer by layer of skinning, the price increases, and it is bound to lose the competitive advantage. We have set up a 'star company' overseas, and both the license and the business have been obtained, but suddenly a general from nowhere appeared, immediately turning into a black star, and it was killed. If it continues like this, I can only change my career to open a 'Liangshanpo Company'!" He said this, and could not help but stand up from the bed, excited, and took a long time to calm down.

I wanted to ask him to talk more about his personal situation, but it was ineffective. Perhaps there are some people in the world who can only live like this, the red line of life is always positioned on the coordinates of public affairs, unwillingly squeezing out the space for enjoyment, and even the illness is a work-related illness. This general manager handwrote a motto in the office: "If one's conduct is correct, orders are not needed; if one's conduct is not correct, orders are not followed." Where is his conduct correct? I found that the biggest feature of this office is that there are many books, both ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign. At the age of 51, he still went to make up for four years of part-time university courses in national economic management. It seems that for a reformer, being an official who is clean and upright is only the basic requirement, and what is not easy for everyone to do is the special ability of political foresight and sharp thinking, only with strategic awareness ahead of time can one reach the high-level meaning of "not ordering but following." His colleagues told me: Old Sun is a comprehensive, brave, and easy-going pioneer. However, in the job performance appraisal records of the general manager, there are also dozens of uncompromising criticisms: "decision-making is too fast, risk is too great"; "not paying attention to safety and receiving a yellow card warning from the city"; "political and ideological work is not detailed"; "migrant workers bear the burden of high-priced grain"...

"These opinions are reasonable." He sincerely told me, "People should have self-knowledge, I, a half-bottle of wine, cannot do the business of Akioka. But as a Communist Party member, as a Chinese person with aspirations, in the transitional period of new and old changes, someone must go to be the vanguard. Once the new and old changes are completed, I will be very happy to retire. I always feel sorry for one person, my wife. I never care about the family, there is no Sunday, and I can't even remember her birthday. At that time, won't there be a chance to make up for it..."

Looking at that weather-beaten face, I suddenly felt pity, but the slightly hunched back gave people a sense of respect. Xi Yuan Yi Mu Garden, wallboard factory, leading enterprise, "fighting for eight years" again eight years... The overloaded burden has been on his shoulders for how many years.

General Manager, the sky will not let down those who work hard, your dream will come true! (with pictures)

　　孙梦兰的梦〔报告文学〕
    中杰英
    在通往亚运村工地的北郊路口立着一块奇特的倒计数牌——７２１天，离亚运会开幕的时间剩下不到两年了。
    这片令人目眩的宏伟工地，鸽灰色的混凝土结构如雨后春笋般拔地而起，２５层的运动员公寓、豪华的国际邮电中心、热力枢纽……营建总面积１４４万平方米，北京住宅建设总公司的２万名职工正在日夜奋战。也许现在还很难查清每幢房子的户口，要到１９９０年的金秋季节，才会变成遍地花木、车水马龙、人群熙攘的繁华世界。可是令人纳闷的是，工地似乎过分地清静，不大像以往所见那种热火朝天、沸腾奔放的景象。
    这家公司的亚运会北郊工程总指挥林金裕告诉我：工程告急，没有水泥，缺乏钢材，让官倒爷们闹得半停工三个月，每天损失２５万元。再这样下去，亚运会可能要换个地方去开！
    就在国庆节前夕，汉城金牌争夺战进入高潮之际，作为总承包和法人代表的公司总经理孙梦兰突然住进医院。感冒、肺炎、发高烧，谢绝探视。有人说这是急火攻心，得了“职业病”；有人说这不过是时间上的巧合，何须大惊小怪……
    他，听不到外界的谈论，此刻已坠入昏沉的梦境。也许他的大半生都在做梦，梦见兰花开放，梦见琼楼玉宇平地升起，梦见仙霖甘露自天洒落，一滴、两滴、三滴……哦，那是输液的玻璃管在颤动。这个梦并不美妙，滚烫的头脑里在打着水泥战、钢材战和价格战。墙是灰的，灯是黄的，眼前不住地闪烁着莫名的图像，欢乐，苦恼，长途跋涉，无边无际。于是他徐徐合上沉重的眼皮，让情节曲折的梦随意驰骋，尽情发挥。难得呀，恐怕只有躺在病床的时候，才能获得一刻的松弛和自由，把人生的道路细细体味……
    这里的人谁也没有见过他１５岁时是什么样子，大军南下，河北省阜平县的地主子女，为了革命，也为了活命，投奔到共产党的大旗下效力。幸而那时并不特别挑剔家庭出身，只要努力，为人民服务的大门是打开的。８年过去了，“老建筑”们大概都还记得，在中共八大“发展生产力”的号召声中，１９５７年曾有过一次小打小闹的改革，这时的孙梦兰已经是北京市第三建筑公司的工区主任了。这位血气方刚的年轻人很想施展一下自己的抱负，异想天开地独自在他主管的西苑一亩园小学工程试行包工、包料、包管理的队组全面负责制。没想到这项只有３００平方米的小零头工程出了奇迹，效率成倍提高，许多难题迎刃而解。这一妙招很快被明眼的上司发现，开始在全市推广“一亩园”经验。
    一剂治疗平均主义的良药，事实本身原已证明了它的生命力，也算是最初绽开的改革之花吧。可惜生不逢时，比后来终于实行的承包制早产２０多年。１９５８年春在北戴河开的那次高级政治会议，指责北京市在搞资本主义物质刺激，此事非同小可，为了保护头面人物蒙混过关，人们只得把它说成是下面小人物的自发起哄。刚刚把有关材料藏匿起来，大跃进的号角便吹起来了。孙梦兰不胜感慨地说：“那是一个多么好的兆头，就这样夭折了。这一耽误不打紧，我们现在的工地管理还追不上那时候的水平！”
    当然，作为承担错误的祸首，他只有反省思过，在工区主任的椅子上沉默８年，失去任何进取的能量。文革风暴袭来之日，自然成了最够资格的活靶子——走资派的大红人、狗崽仔、修正主义黑苗、阶级异己分子。人们专为“一亩园”办了展览会，演出活报剧，鼻子上抹成小丑的模样，最后开除党籍，监督劳动。北京三建公司斗张百发的时候也常拉了孙梦兰去陪绑，可是“保皇派”给张百发送饺子却没有他的份，因为他不够“工贼”的份，是“混”入工人队伍的杂牌。被关在同一间屋子的张百发发牢骚说：“老子才当了十来天的经理，就成了反动派。”孙梦兰有点不服气：“你不冤，我连一天也没过瘾呢！”
    孙梦兰带着满心怨气被发配到湖北十堰第二汽车厂工地，人生的第一次大挫折，渴求有所作为的宏愿变成幽暗的噩梦，拿挖土来出闷气。
    又是一个８年，二汽工程告一段落，回到北京便赶上了另一个噩梦，“反击右倾翻案风”把那时刚刚出现的一丝希望击碎了。那么多的伤痕，反复无常的揉搓和折腾，他本来打算从此消声匿迹，当个挣钱养家的顺民也罢。然而严酷的现实却不时地冲击着内心的良知，在阔别多年的首都地面展目四望，他看到的是什么呢？经济停滞和生产凋蔽留下了灰暗的简易楼和陈旧的市政设施；严重的房荒让无家可归者为了每平方米的生存空间而争得头破血流；前三门的楼群立在原地快一年了仍是黑暗世界……比比外面更加令人不寒而栗，原来技术经济指标落后于我们的地区和国家纷纷赶到前面去了，更不必说那些工业强国，远远地把我们抛到了博物馆的角落。７０年代中期每一名建筑职工的大体人均年产量，美国１００平方米，日本８０，苏联６０，中国只有２０，还是低价建筑。当别人用钢结构轻质壁板建造１００层摩天大厦的时候，我们仍然徘徊在大量使用秦砖汉瓦，手工砌筑，肩抬人扛的可怜境地！材料，技术，管理，生产效益，组织措施，机械化施工，就像一盘散沙，头痛吃阿斯匹灵，脚痛贴伤湿止痛膏。中国的建筑业，你究竟得了什么病，你为什么还在留恋春秋战国的科学成果呢？
    孙梦兰伫立在施工中的崇文旅馆脚手架上，不由得落下了悲愤的热泪。是的，他总是喜欢登高眺望，因为那无垠的远方可让他获得动力，鼓起勇气。难道，难道仅仅由于一己之恩怨便自我挫败进取的锐气，告别“安得广厦千万间”的平生抱负和信念？那不是太脆弱也太自私了吗！然而毕竟皱纹已爬上额头，他在风雨中学得更聪明、更老练了。他想起了2０年前的“一亩园”，深知眼下的社会大背景仍不容许开无轨电车，于是他来到一块山高皇帝远、不招苍蝇的天外天，利用一点小小的活动余地，再次从零起步，重温实干家的旧梦。在这家远离市区的住宅壁板厂，一来尽量回避干扰，二来产品单纯，却是先进施工方法的生产准备基地，可对前方作有力的支援。
    这个默默无闻的厂长一干又是８年！也不知经历了多少夜以继日地苦心筹划，使出浑身解数来整治这个连年亏损的烂摊子。是历史的大转折给他带来了运气，这次没有重演“一亩园”的悲剧。当别人还在起跑线上犹豫观望之际，这家不景气的工厂居然一马当先，扭亏为盈，创下年盈利６４０万元的纪录，挂上了先进企业的招牌。在孙梦兰离任之前，党员和职工们一致推举他当了北京市的党代表、区人民代表和市劳动模范。
    “我并没有包治百病的药方。要问我有什么体会，就是舍得下功夫，看得准，抓得狠，不信邪，肯拚命……”他向我淡然一笑说。看来正是凭着这身顽强执著、不计荣辱、甘坐冷板凳的韧功夫，孙梦兰才得以在壁板厂“抗战八年”之后脱颖而出，杀向一个更有作为的、视野开阔的新天地。１９８３年，为了加速解决紧迫的住房问题，为了防止分散力量乱拉队伍去搞什么条子工程楼堂馆所，北京市决然组建专业性的住宅建设总公司，孙梦兰被选派为副总经理。他的梦越做越大了。
    现状是险峻的。农业改革成就卓然，乡镇工业欣欣向荣，这简直就像是在经济领域重演一次农村包围城市的历史剧。建筑业，这个从旧时代染上不少行帮陋俗，长期习惯于手工业小生产者劳动方式的群体，改革出路何在呢？新建单位一团乱麻，如何理顺头绪，使之最有效地承担起给北京人盖房子的艰巨任务呢？一串一串的忧虑念头掠过去，孙梦兰似乎突然抓住了一个闪光点：这次机会十分难得，正是因为新单位还没有形成沉重的运动惯性，操纵起步方向不但大有选择余地，而且可以节省力气！一定要试一试，怎么用先进手段经营建筑业，怎么发挥大型企业的实力优势。我就不信，几万人的大公司，拥有大量高级人才、熟练工人和成套设备的洋枪洋炮干不过乡下人的大刀长矛。
    这次机遇的宝贵还在于，孙梦兰正好分工去主管人事与劳动生产。万事人为首，百病懒在先。既然大权在握，他决计第一刀就切在人事身上。
    百元产值工资含量，平方米指标包干，是外单位经验，先拿过来用用再说。这一下工人的口袋与产品价值挂上铁钩了。有人说物质刺激这个词是赫鲁晓夫创造的，不好听，可按劳分配却是地道的社会主义。当年乱批修正主义，结果怎样呢？建筑工人创造了一个新名词——按酬付劳！
    然而孙梦兰很快就发现，“刺激”也不是万能的。有首民谣说建筑工人“远看像群逃难的，近看像个要饭的”，进入８０年代，北京青年的胃口大了，卖苦力多挣钱失去了吸引力。可不是，大城市赚轻松钱的路子多着呐，何必到砖瓦灰砂堆里去找罪受。这位劳动人事副经理蓦然觉出了四面楚歌的困境，老职工伤病转退，精壮劳力招不进来，技术人才青黄不接。他终于意识到如今已不是“一亩园”和壁板厂的时代了，简单的劳资供求关系起了变化，城市青年奔向高智力发展和市场谋利，而城乡差别却在触发第二次人口大流动。还是面向现实吧，这才是马克思主义活的灵魂。
    于是孙梦兰斗胆干了一件破天荒的事，对外发布题目叫“用工制度改革”，实则为了解救燃眉之急，打开后门招进大批民工，经过短期培训立即上岗顶班。多挣钱还能过几天城市生活，逛逛花花世界，对世代困居乡下的农民是多么大的诱惑。成千上万的棒小伙子潮水般涌上工地，老实听话，愿学技术，劳动热情高涨，比那些可气的京油子们好使多了。不过劳动部门也不含糊，当场抓住了那只违法乱纪的手，现行政策不许合同工进城，发出警告限时清退。孙梦兰答复说：“我右手招工，左手拿文件，这叫合理不合法。要是北京人不想住房，要是劳动局长的子女愿意来当泥瓦匠，我马上辞退民工。”官司越打越大，他赢了！新文件转发全国，始作俑者打破僵局，如今的北京一线建筑工人，农民合同工已占到６０％之众。
    然而孙梦兰的眼光看得还要远些，这并不是全面提高人员素质的治本之策，光有初级劳动力是无法迎来高技术时代的。他说：“这几年社会上盛行所谓的短期行为，做买卖的捞一把就溜，乡镇工厂分光盈利，当干部的大印过手以权谋私。国营企业也有办法，新官上任三把火，拚设备拚库存，多给福利多发奖金，落个名声光彩。这也难怪，宦海浮沉，谁知上边明天又变了什么道道，落着了便宜就算落着了。可是我又一想，孙猴子７２变，最后取经还是离不了孙猴子，人才这一仗必须打持久战，绝不可干杀鸡取卵的缺德事。”他又一次充当了出头鸟，开始大量抽调在职人员，选送到大专院校定向深造。此事震动了住宅总公司，也叫北京建筑业的同行们咋舌惊叹。那些过去的红卫兵、上山下乡的、自学成才的，凡是具备一定文化基础又有上学愿望的，经考核合格通通分期分批派出，愈有能耐的表现愈好的，愈要提前派送。拿孙梦兰的话说，一是舍得花钱，二是舍得抽人，３年时间一共送出１０００多人，以致从本公司内部再也难于招上自愿的合格学员了。于是他又变了一着，以合同方式委托专业水平高的院校，如清华大学、北京工业大学、北京建工学院和南京工学院等，在北京多招一个班的学生，毕业后如数返还。由此付出的代价相当可观，有些交换条件甚至是苛刻的，据副总经理林金裕介绍，每名学生要搭出１．５万元以上，累计总培训费达几千万元！
    这样的新奇事当然不会风平浪静，人家说“经理们‘烧包’了，拿我们的血汗钱去供养不干活的少爷”，“顶事的都上学去了，技术部门成真空管了”，“三流九等只有文凭香了”……孙梦兰慨叹道：“也不知道挨了多少骂才熬过来的，现在学生们陆续返回，成为技术和管理骨干，起了大作用，人们也开始理解什么是人才开发、智力投资和感情投资了。送出去的人一旦回来，大多会产生强烈的社团意识，深怀报答企业之心，这可是用现钱买不来的。”而当那些原先持怀疑态度的人们如今正在为缺乏中高级专业人才发愁，为抢不到德才兼备的大学生焦急的时候，孙总经理不禁暗中庆幸：我没有看错皇历，挨骂也值了！
    正是由于一支高素质的常备军的迅速形成，使得住宅建设总公司具备成熟的条件去实现干部制度的全面改革，推行不打折扣的考核聘任制和优化劳动组合制。与之配套的民主评议、人事透明度和公开性，在这里已逐渐成为日常的公众生活。这张由孙梦兰一手设计的、密密麻麻的年度考绩表格，采用无记名秘密打分，对他自己同样有效。那纸上印着的一道道硬杠杠，正在切断任人唯亲和大锅饭混日子的中国旧企业史，为人们开拓一个公正的、人尽其才的劳动新纪元。我在下面私自走访时很突出的感觉，是干部们都在紧张工作而井井有条，待人接物懂行有礼，态度负责，几乎见不到东串西聊的闲人。据说，这几年淘汰下去的干部已有六七百人。
    “１０年了——”孙梦兰拉长声音说，“总的来讲，建筑业的改革初见成效，目前走到了僵持阶段。我在１９８６年接任总经理的时候就预感到，改革再难于深入下去了，因为已经老化的生产关系束缚了生产力，现行体制限制我们发挥最大经济效益。百元产值工资含量制的弊病早已露头，渐渐演变成产值挂帅，为了多拿钱而不顾质量，牺牲实际效益。另一方面，我们的科技与经济人才已经具备高效能的成套服务实力，但还在当产值的奴隶，承包的仅仅是一段简单的施工劳务。打个比方说，人是由大脑支配手去完成协调动作的，但是现在脑袋长在别人身上，只用我们的一双手，整个躯体便失去主体意识。本来是为了解决政企不分才把原先的管理局改为总公司的，但是这种公司久久不能转化为独立经营的经济实体。不给营业执照，不让自由参加市场竞争和最有利可图的经济活动，只起到给下属各建筑公司分派任务和监督生产的作用，岂不是换汤不换药，又回到政府职能的老路上去了？要知道我现在是总经理，是使用国有资金做生意的商人而不是行政长官，更不是倒卖人力的二道贩子包工头……”
    他为什么要说这番话呢？有必要简单说明一下尚不大为人所知的、一直在执行的基本建设体制：向国家申报项目已获批准并取得预算资金的业主叫甲方，然后按序向规划局、房地产局和其它许多的局申请划地、征地或买地，须承办许多诸如拆迁、农民就业、产权界定等等的复杂事务。而后委托被称为丙方的各专业设计院绘制图纸，包括设备、建筑物和盖房、开路、水暖、电力等等的施工图。其后按工价合同把施工任务交给建筑公司，叫做乙方。等房屋竣工，又分别再请也叫乙方的道路、水电等市政公司挖沟埋线，接通试载；最后还得请其它部门来种树、开商店、盖学校，连派出所、居委会和存车处都得一一烧香作揖，否则别想住进人去。由此可见其过程之长、关卡之多，只要有一个小衙门伤风感冒，你便无奈其何。全国之所以出现不少三边工程、胡子工程、无底工程和“鬼楼”，多年不得完工或完工多年仍然黑灯瞎火，缺水无热，大多与这套“软件”太软有关。而在先进工业国，早就不这么干了。由一家大公司总承包，从开头的买地到最后的绿化，由各子公司分包项目，或一方全部代办手续，买集体票不排队，到时候只要给业主一把开门的钥匙，便万事大吉了。这就是所谓的“交钥匙工程”，从Ｔｕｎｒｋｅｙｂｉｄ译过来的，中央电视台的中级英语课《夺魁》，讲的便是其投标的全过程。其实苏联亦早已建立类似的总体承包企业组织，称为托拉斯。这种一体化方式对甲乙双方都有利，统一安排，内部协调，缩短周期，减少扯皮，提高效益，皆大欢喜。只是中国人太墨守成规，官商传统积重难返，至今对此仅墙外观望而已。
    “你在建筑业没白干，说得还差不多。”孙梦兰带着几分病容笑道，“我想办的正是那种一条龙的企业，不过中国有自己的国情，不会原样照搬。我们有一阵过份强调企业越小越好，可是拿乡镇工厂来套大公司，就否定了大的优越性。没有国家代表队，派谁去奥运会？这种小农经济观点一时扭不过来，因此还不能一步到达理想规模，我们只是自称‘龙头企业’，也就是以一个主导企业为骨架的产业集团，也算是中国特色吧。”　　
    “为了减少转轨的阻力，”他又说，“我预先作了人员和决策的长期准备，研究制订规划，打算搞一次自下而上的自发行动。然而一亮相便受到异议，我只好半公开地先干起来了。万幸的是，恰好遇上赵紫阳和李鹏批示在全国推广鲁布革经验，把我救了！建设部这才发现我们一批企业早已是初具雏形的黑马，今年夏天终于取得合法地位，荣幸地戴上‘龙头’帽子……”
    时间不长，现在下结论恐怕为时过早。孙梦兰这次做的美梦一年多了，他干了些什么呢？
    新体制从几十年老框框中蜕变出来了，企业从管理型转为经营型，粗放型转为集约型，劳动密集型转化为智力密集型，从清场、设计、科研、采购、施工到交钥匙的一体化机制开始运行。管理层与作业层已经分开，由条块分割改行项目管理，那就是说，１００多个项目的承包者在企业内部不再是行政下属，而是契约合同的执行者，他必须对用户负责到底，将来房子漏雨也要他去打伞。
    这家龙头公司正在开展房地产全面开发的业务活动，亚运会８１０工程和新建苏联大使馆初试成功；亚运会北郊邮电中心由于实行项目管理提前竣工。总公司在综合调整中近来年产值递增１８％，完工面积年增１０％，人均产值１．４万元，所完成的住宅面积已占到北京市大型国营建筑业计划总额的３９％，年产值达６亿元。
    知名度更高的北京利康烤鸭店和利康搬家公司，是为其企业主体服务的第三产业。目前的利康集团已发展到旅游、饭店、搬迁、建筑装修和家具修复等多种经营，成为北京有名的劳务开发明珠。本来只是为了消纳编余人员和职工子女而设的“人库”，孙梦兰却从不冷落歧视，给予资金、人才和业务指导的最优惠待遇，终于成了大气候，今天已能创造出几千名建筑工人的产值，反过来为企业本体争得了市场和声誉。北京人所津津乐道的“薄利多销、服务到家”的利康精神，已引出两部《鸭子敲门》的同名剧本，一部是京剧，另一部是电视剧，不日即可面世。
    孙梦兰还在想什么呢？打出北京城去！海南开发公司，通县开发公司和择地开设利康分店，这是国内的。扎伊尔体育场，蒙博托总统庄园……下一个目标，两伊停战，中东市场正在招手，这是国外的。与香港德荣公司合作建立装饰公司，与法国波莱日集团合建金融大厦，这是合资的。中国的建筑队伍素质好，吃苦耐劳，工价低廉，讲求信誉，海外人士有口皆碑，这样优越的竞争条件，这样丰富的劳务资源，为什么不去闯一闯呢，为什么不进入世界大循环呢？！
    且慢，美梦成真还有艰险的路程！
    “我们走的每一步，都要付出沉重代价。”孙梦兰不无痛苦地说：“你知道吗，我们现在是违法户。企业机能变了，垂直领导体制没有变，还用老政策的手指头给我号脉，内系统仍然政企不分，外系统市场混乱无序。你想获得交钥匙的项目，业主们不认真人，还是把盖房子的过程一段一段地切，宁可８年不住人也不敢越雷池一步。材料价格双轨制，官倒爷让我们吃了大苦头，因为无权联营原料基地，前景暗淡。我住院的前一天，北京某涉外饭店说可用美元买他们的水泥，报价之高令人恐惧。饭店能生产水泥吗？可是亚运会工程就卡在这些二大爷的手里，连关系到国家面子的大事都无情无义了！至于国外市场更是寒心，不许自己找食吃，工程项目要装在别人的口袋里，经过层层扒皮，工价上涨，必然失去竞争优势。我们在国外开办过一个‘明星公司’，执照和生意都拿下来了，不知从哪儿突然杀出来一员程咬金，马上变成黑明星，枪毙了。要这样下去，我只好改行去开‘梁山泊公司’了！”他说到这儿，不由得激动地从病床上站起来，久久未能平静。
    我本想再请他多谈一点个人情况，然而难以奏效。也许世界上有些人只能这样活着，生命的红线永远在公众事务的座标上定位，无奈地挤掉了享乐的空间，连得的也是工作病。这位总经理在办公室手录一幅座右铭曰：“其身正，不令而行，其身不正，虽令不从。”其身正于何处呢？我发现这间办公室与众不同的最大特点就是书多，古今中外杂类相陈。那年５１岁，他还是去补上了四年业余大学的国民经济管理班。看来对一个改革家来说，为官清廉正派仅是起码的要求，而并非人人都能做到的是必备政治远见和思路敏锐的特殊才能，只有战略上的意识超前才可能达到高层次意义的“不令而行”。他的同事们告诉我：老孙是个知识全面、有胆有识，敢冒风险又平易可亲的开拓型人物。不过在对总经理的述职考核记录上也写着几十条不客气的批评：“决策太快，风险太大”；“不重视安全受到市里黄牌警告”，“政治思想工作不细致”；“民工吃高价粮负担太重”……
    “这些意见都是有道理的。”他诚恳地对我说，“人贵有自知之明，像我这样的半瓶醋干不出亚柯卡的事业。可是作为共产党人，作为有追求的中国人，在新旧交迭的特定过渡时期，总要有人去充当过河的兵卒。一旦完成新陈代谢，我很高兴下野。我始终觉得对不起的一个人，就是我的老伴。我从不顾家，没有星期天，连她的生日都记不住。到那时候不是还有点弥补的机会吗……”
    我望着那张饱经风霜的脸，忽然动了可怜的心，然而那微驼的肩背却让人油然顿生可敬之感。一亩园，壁板厂，龙头企业，“抗战八年”又８年……超负荷的担子在肩上压了多少年啊。
    总经理同志，天不亏人，你的梦会实现的！（附图片）
