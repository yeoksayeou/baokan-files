He is an old writer who has worked tirelessly for decades writing lyrics. His songs have been sung from the early days of the founding of the nation to the 1980s, from the mouths of grandmothers to the hearts of grandchildren. Although he is over sixty, his pen is still sharp, and every new work he produces is met with admiration from his peers.

Qiao Yu is unremarkable in appearance, but he is affectionately known as "Mr. Qiao." Qiao Yu is talkative, and he believes that "when friends come, there is good wine." Qiao Yu loves talent and nurtures young people. Qiao Yu has wide-ranging interests and has close friends in the realms of poetry, books, music, and painting. Qiao Yu also knows how to make noodles, which is because his wife loves hot noodle soup.

He learned calligraphy in his youth, specifically the "thin gold script." He also loves to sing and can still remember a song he learned in his childhood, which he can sing in English, "The Last Rose of Summer."

He studied economics in college. After joining the revolution, one of his articles discussing the economic policies of land reform in the liberated areas drew considerable attention.

He has also performed on stage, although he has never played a major role. During propaganda performances for the people of the liberated areas, he could even lie down on the ground for an hour or two, dressed in colorful cloth and holding a small tree, pretending to be a "little hill."

He was once a professional writer but did not stay at home. He held positions such as commune secretary and county propaganda department head, living long-term in the countryside of Hebei. People are familiar with the films "Liu Sanjie" and "Red Children," and the songs "Ode to the Motherland," "Let Us Row, Row, Row Our Boat," "The Beautiful Scenery of Shanxi," "Rose in My Heart," "Unforgettable Tonight," and "Song of the Peony," all of which are the works of this lyricist. People also remember that the grand musical and dance epic "The East Is Red" and "Songs of the Chinese Revolution" are soaked with his heart and sweat.

Now, Qiao Yu holds leadership positions at the China Opera and Dance Drama Theater and the Chinese Music Literature Society. Amidst his busy schedule, he continues to write lyrics, from "River," "The World Needs Warm Hearts," and "Longing," to "Talking about Strange Stories."

The theme song "My Motherland" from the film "Battle on Shangganling Mountain" is one of Qiao Yu's representative works. Time flies, and in March 1979, soldiers on the front lines, holding rifles and tears in their eyes, still sang, "A great river with waves wide, the wind blows the fragrant rice flowers on both banks..." This song expresses the rich emotions of the soldiers for their motherland, their people, peace, and their mothers and children. After years of testing, "My Motherland" is still loved by Chinese people at home and abroad. Its lyrics are sincere and heartfelt, with no excessive adjectives, no piles of metaphors, and no empty rhetoric. What it has is concise thoughts, elevated emotions, and seemingly simple but deeply moving language. The success of Qiao Yu's lyrics, aside from his deep literary cultivation and classical poetry foundation, also lies in his skillful use of plain language that everyone can understand, creating extraordinary images and scenes, and expressing extraordinary thoughts and emotions. His lyrics make it difficult to see the writing techniques and traces of polishing. I think this skill is probably what people call "mastery"!

"I entrust my thoughts to the travelers of past and present,
I dedicate my passion to the sailors of the vast waves..."

This is a line from Qiao Yu's "Song of the Goddess of Wushan." I remember that it was last autumn when we took the "Light Boat" to tour the Three Gorges. As the boat passed the Goddess Peak, Qiao Yu, looking at the misty cliffs, spontaneously recited these two lines, which were praised by his fellow travelers.

I think: the "I" in that is not someone other than Qiao Yu himself!

### “乔老爷”和他的歌词——写在“乔羽歌词作品演唱会”开幕时

　　“乔老爷”和他的歌词    
    ——写在“乔羽歌词作品演唱会”开幕时
    晓光
    他是一位辛辛苦苦写了几十年歌词的老作家。他写的歌从建国初期一直传唱到８０年代，从奶奶的口中一直飘落到孙儿的心头。虽然他年逾花甲，却笔不生涩，每有新作问世，总有妙语令同行们赞叹不已。
    乔羽貌不惊人，雅号“乔老爷”。乔羽健谈，“朋友来了有好酒。”乔羽爱才，扶植培养年轻人。乔羽兴趣广泛，诗书琴画界皆有挚友。乔羽还会擀面条，那是他夫人爱吃热汤面的缘故。
    他自幼习就一手“瘦金体”。他还喜欢唱歌，直到现在，他还记得儿时学会的一首歌曲，能用英文演唱《夏日里最后一朵玫瑰》。
    他上大学读的是经济系。参加革命后，他的一篇论述解放区土改经济政策的文章，还引起过人们的注目。
    他也曾登台演出，虽然从未演过重要角色。在向解放区的群众做宣传演出时，他甚至可以身披彩布，抱棵小树俯卧在地，一动不动地装上个把钟头的“小山坡”。
    他曾是个专业作家，但并未坐在家里。他挂着公社书记、县委宣传部长的职务，长期生活在河北的农村。人们熟悉的电影《刘三姐》、《红孩子》，歌曲《祖国颂》、《让我们荡起双桨》、《人说山西好风光》、《心中的玫瑰》、《难忘今宵》、《牡丹之歌》等都出自这位词作家之手。人们还记得，大型音乐舞蹈史诗《东方红》、《中国革命之歌》里也浸着他的心血和汗水。
    现在乔羽在中国歌剧舞剧院和中国音乐文学学会担任领导工作。忙忙碌碌之中，他还不断地写着歌词，从《河流》、《世界需要热心肠》、《思念》，到《说聊斋》。
    电影《上甘岭》的主题歌《我的祖国》是乔羽的代表作之一。时光如流，１９７９年３月，前线的将士们手握钢枪，眼噙热泪依然唱着“一条大河波浪宽，风吹稻花香两岸……”这歌声倾诉着情感丰富的战士们对祖国，对人民，对和平，对母亲和妻儿深深的爱。经过悠悠岁月的考验，《我的祖国》至今仍然受到海内外中国人的喜爱。它的歌词情真意切，其中没有堆砌的形容词，没有成叠的比喻句，也没有华而不实的罗嗦话。这里有的是凝练的思想、升华的感情和看来平白却能够深深打动人心的语言。乔羽歌词的成功，除了他有深厚的文学修养、古典诗词的功底之外，还在于他善于使用人们一听就明白的平凡语言，创造不平凡的形象和意境，抒发不平凡的思想和感情。他的词作让人难以看出写作的技巧和雕琢的痕迹，我想这功夫大概就是人们所说的“炉火纯青”吧！
    “我把议论付与古往今来的过客，
    我把豪情献给惊涛万里的船夫……”
    这是乔羽在《巫山神女之歌》中落在“词眼”上的警句。记得那是前年秋末，我们一同乘“轻舟号”游览大小三峡。船过神女峰时，乔羽望着云雾缭绕的峭岩，脱口吟出这两句词，引得同行诸友交口称誉。
    我想：那其中之“我”不就是乔羽吗？
