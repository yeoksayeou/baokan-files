Cadets from the People's Liberation Army Changsha Engineering Academy have stepped out of the campus to understand the reform situation through practical experience, reducing doubts and strengthening their resolve.

Recently, cadets at Changsha Engineering Academy have been discussing the reform situation extensively. Some believe that issues such as rapid price increases are caused by the reforms, leading to doubts about the achievements and necessity of further deepening the reforms. In response, the academy's party committee organized cadets to conduct social surveys during their holidays and in conjunction with political theory classes, visiting factories, rural areas, and agricultural markets. This allowed them to experience the situation firsthand and understand the reform landscape. In just the second half of last year, cadets wrote over 820 social survey reports. During their investigations in Shaping Township, Changsha County, and Changsha Automobile Engine Factory, cadets learned that over the past decade, Shaping Township's total agricultural output value increased by 6270,000 yuan, grain production increased by 1300,000 kilograms, and township enterprises grew from none to 44, with last year's output value reaching 39,350,000 yuan. The per capita income in the township rose from 89 yuan in 1978 to 860 yuan in 1987. The Changsha Automobile Engine Factory's profits over three years of reform exceeded the total of the previous 30 years. Cadets deeply felt that the reforms over the past decade have yielded tremendous achievements.

Do reforms bring about social inequity in distribution? Through social surveys, cadets learned that a few units and individuals have exploited loopholes in the reforms, such as speculation, causing some people's incomes to far exceed those of ordinary workers. However, this is not a result of the reforms. As for those who, by ending the "iron rice bowl" system, have increased their incomes through labor and good management, their incomes are allowed to exceed the general social level as long as their operations are legal. Cadets believe that reforming the previous system of egalitarian distribution has motivated people, and the reforms are good.

In organizing cadets to conduct social surveys and understand the situation, the academy does not avoid the current negative aspects, allowing cadets to fully understand and analyze these problems. Through social surveys, cadets saw issues such as the rapid growth of consumption funds, rampant "official speculation" and "private speculation," conflicts in interest distribution among various social strata, and the various difficulties faced by enterprises. They understood the arduousness and complexity of the reforms, deepened their understanding of the Party Central Committee's decisions on rectifying the economic environment and economic order, and enhanced their ability to cope with potential problems in future reforms. 70% of the cadets wrote letters to their relatives and friends, propagating the achievements of the reforms and hoping they would correctly understand the problems within the reforms.

　　长沙工程兵学院组织社会调查
    学员们走出校门了解改革形势
    本报讯  人民解放军长沙工程兵学院学员走出校门，到改革的实践中认识改革的形势，减少了疑虑，坚定了信心。
    近来，长沙工程兵学院学员对改革的形势议论较多，有的认为物价上涨过猛等问题是改革造成的，对改革的成绩和进一步深化的必要性产生了怀疑。对此学院党委组织学员利用假期回乡、结合政治理论课教学，到工厂、农村、农贸市场进行社会调查，身历其境，了解改革的形势。仅去年下半年，学员就写出社会调查报告８２０多份。学员在长沙县沙坪乡和长沙汽车发动机总厂的调查中了解到，沙坪乡１０年来，农业总产值增长６２７万元，粮食增产１３０万公斤，乡镇企业从无到有发展到４４个，去年产值达到３９３５万元，全乡人均收入由１９７８年的８９元提高到１９８７年的８６０元。长沙汽车发动机总厂改革后３年的利润，超过改革前３０年的总和。学员们深切地感到，改革１０年，成绩巨大。
    改革是否带来了社会分配不公？学员们通过社会调查了解到，少数单位和个人钻改革的空子，如倒卖等，造成了一部分人的收入大大超过社会一般职工的收入，但这不是改革造成的。至于因端掉了“大锅饭”，一部分人靠劳动，靠善于经营，收入高出社会一般水平，只要经营合法，则是允许的。学员们认为，改革过去分配上的平均主义，调动了人们的积极性，改得好。
    学院在组织学员开展社会调查、进行形势教育中，不回避当前的消极面，让学员充分了解和分析这些问题。学员通过社会调查，看到消费基金增长过猛，“官倒”、“私倒”猖獗，社会各阶层在利益分配上的矛盾和企业面临的种种困难等等，懂得了改革的艰巨性和复杂性，加深了对党中央关于治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序的决策的理解，提高了对今后改革可能出现的问题的承受能力。全院有７０％的学员向亲友写信，宣传改革的成绩，希望他们正确认识改革中的问题。
