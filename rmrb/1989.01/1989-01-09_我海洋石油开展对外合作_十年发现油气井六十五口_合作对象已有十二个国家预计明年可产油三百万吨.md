China's marine petroleum industry has achieved remarkable results in foreign cooperation in the field of offshore oil exploration and development. In the past 10 years, a total of 169 wells have been drilled, 36 oil and gas structures have been found, and 65 oil and gas wells have been discovered. Experts believe that such a drilling success rate is quite high.

China's marine petroleum industry began foreign cooperation in 1979. So far, 43 offshore oil contracts or agreements have been signed, with a total cooperation area of 150,000 square kilometers, mainly in the South China Sea and Bohai Sea regions. The cooperation partners include 45 companies from 12 countries such as Japan, France, and the United States.

China's first offshore oil field, the Chengbei Oil Field, was put into production in October 1985, marking the beginning of China's marine petroleum exploration and development. Currently, there are two oil fields and one platform in production from Sino-Japanese and Sino-French cooperation, with an annual oil production of over 700,000 tons. Additionally, there are 7 oil and gas fields under development or in the preparation stage. Among them, two oil fields in the Bohai Sea region from Sino-Japanese cooperation will be completed and put into production soon; the gas field in the South Sea from cooperation with the American Arco Company is also about to begin development and construction.

According to experts, from now until 1993, China will have offshore oil fields put into production every year. It is estimated that the offshore oil production in 1990 will reach around 300,000 tons.

To accelerate marine petroleum development, China has conducted two rounds of international bidding since 1983. Most of the contracts signed so far are results of these bids. The third round of offshore oil bidding officially began on January 3. This round's area is the East Sand and Shengli regions of the Zhujiangkou Basin in the South China Sea, covering an area of over 30,000 square kilometers. Previous exploration results have confirmed that this region has good oil generation and storage conditions, and an oil field with reserves of over 100 million tons has already been discovered, indicating a promising prospect for oil and gas exploration.

It is reported that the policies and measures for the third round of bidding are more favorable and flexible, which can reduce the risk investment and various cost burdens for foreign companies.

　　我海洋石油开展对外合作
    十年发现油气井六十五口
    合作对象已有十二个国家预计明年可产油三百万吨
    新华社北京１月８日电  （记者赵明亮）记者从中国海洋石油总公司获悉，我国在海洋石油勘探开发方面的对外合作取得令人瞩目的成果。在过去的１０年间，共打探井１６９口，找到含油气构造３６个，发现油气井６５口，专家认为，这样的钻探成功率是很高的。
    我国海洋石油行业的对外合作是从１９７９年开始的，目前已先后签订４３项海上石油合同或协议，合作区总面积达１５万平方公里，主要位于南海和渤海地区。合作对象已有日、法、美等１２个国家的４５家公司。
    我国第一个海上油田是１９８５年１０月投产的埕北油田，它标志着我国海洋石油进入了勘探、开发并举的阶段。目前正在生产的已有中日、中法合作的两个油田和１个平台，年产油量共达７０多万吨。另有７个油气田正在进行开发建设或建设准备工作，其中中日合作的渤海地区的两个油田将于近期建成投产；与美国阿科公司合作的南莺歌海的一个气田也即将进行开发建设。
    据专家介绍，从现在起到１９９３年，我国每年都将有海上油田投产，预计１９９０年海上石油产量可达３００万吨左右。
    为加快海洋石油开发，我国已从１９８３年开始，先后进行了两次国际招标，目前已签订的大部分即国际招标的结果。第三次海上石油招标已于１月３日正式开始。这次招标的海域为南海珠江口盆地东沙——神?地区，面积共３万多平方公里。前几年的勘探结果证实，这一地区具有良好的生油和储油条件，并已有储量达亿吨以上的一个油田发现，具有可喜的找油气前景。
    据介绍，第三次招标的政策、措施也更加优惠和灵活，可减少外商的风险投资和各种费用负担。
