East Germany today announced that by the end of 1990, it will unilaterally reduce its military by 10,000 personnel, including the disbandment of 6 tank regiments and 600 tanks, the dissolution of one air force squadron, and the retirement of 50 combat aircraft. At the same time, East Germany will reduce its military budget by 10%.

East German leader Honecker made this announcement at a banquet welcoming visiting Swedish Prime Minister Carlsson.

Honecker also announced that the Soviet Union will withdraw 2 tank divisions, 2 independent tank training regiments, and 8 independent battalions from East Germany this year, and in 1990, it will withdraw an additional 2 tank divisions, 1 airborne brigade, 3 training regiments, and 3 independent battalions.

Honecker held talks with Carlsson today, and both sides welcomed the results of the recent Vienna meeting, believing it marked the beginning of conventional arms reduction negotiations.

Honecker emphasized that East Germany, located on the front line of confrontation between the two major military blocs, firmly advocates including tactical nuclear weapons deployed in Europe in the arms reduction agenda.

Both sides expressed great satisfaction with the development of economic and trade relations between the two countries in recent years. In 1987, the trade volume between the two countries reached 1.983 billion foreign exchange marks, setting a historical high. The hosts and guests are confident that the scope and scale of cooperation between the two countries will further expand in the future.

Carlsson's visit is a return visit to Honecker's trip to Sweden in 1986 and is the first Swedish prime minister to officially visit East Germany.

Carlsson also discussed humanitarian issues with Honecker in Berlin, met with Protestant representatives, and will leave for his home country tomorrow.

The West German Defense Minister Scharping today issued a statement in Bonn, stating that the announcement by East German leader Honecker of a unilateral reduction of 10,000 troops and a 10% cut in the defense budget is a "constructive signal" for the Warsaw Pact to eliminate conventional superiority.

Scharping also hopes that East Germany will fully implement the human rights requirements set by the CSCE.

The West German Alliance Party also welcomed Honecker's announcement of the reduction of troops.

    西德国防部长发表声明表示欢迎
    新华社柏林１月２３日电  民主德国今天宣布，到１９９０年底，民主德国将单方面裁军１万人，包括裁减６个坦克团、６００辆坦克，解散一个空军飞行大队，使５０架作战飞机退役；与此同时，民主德国将减少军费１０％。
    民主德国领导人昂纳克是在欢迎来访的瑞典王国首相卡尔松的宴会上宣布这一决定的。
    昂纳克同时宣布，苏联今年将从民主德国撤走２个坦克师、２个独立坦克教练团、８个独立营，１９９０年将再撤走２个坦克师、一个空降旅、３个教练团和３个独立营。
    昂纳克今天同卡尔松进行了会谈，双方对最近举行的维也纳会晤取得的成果表示欢迎，认为它开始了常规裁军谈判的进程。
    昂纳克强调，地处两大军事集团对峙前沿的民主德国，坚决主张把部署在欧洲的战术核武器列入裁军议程。
    双方对近年来两国经济贸易关系的发展表示十分满意。１９８７年，两国贸易额达１９．８３亿外汇马克，创历史最高水平。宾主确信，今后两国合作领域和规模还将进一步扩大。
    卡尔松此行是对昂纳克１９８６年瑞典之行的回访，也是第一位正式访问民主德国的瑞典王国首相。

    新华社波恩１月２３日电　联邦德国国防部长朔尔茨今天在波恩发表声明认为，民主德国领导人昂纳克宣布单方面裁军１万人和削减国防预算１０％，是为华约消除常规优势作出贡献的一个“建设性信号”。
    朔尔茨在声明中还希望民主德国能全面实现欧安会所确定的人权方面的要求。
    西德联盟党也对昂纳克宣布裁军表示欢迎。
