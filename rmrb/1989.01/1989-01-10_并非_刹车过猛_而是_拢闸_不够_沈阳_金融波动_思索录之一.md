Title: Not "Brakes Too Hard" but "Throttle Not Enough"

The year 1988 was a tumultuous one for Shenyang. Just as the panic buying subsided, the financial sector experienced fluctuations.

The Agricultural Bank of China was short on funds;
The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China had severe overdrafts;
The Construction Bank of China had halted lending.

Banks have always been the "money chest" of economic construction, always ready to lend money without hesitation. But today, what's happening?

The cause of the event seems clear to everyone: In recent years, economic development has been too rapid, leading to inflation. To control inflation, credit must be tightened and the scale of lending controlled. In the past few months, the Shenyang municipal government, in accordance with national directives, successively reduced construction and production loans. This action indeed slowed down the overheated economic growth. However, what followed was a series of emergencies from enterprises, with many factory directors and managers expressing through various channels: enterprise funds are in a state of paralysis, with no money to purchase raw materials, and production is on the verge of a major slump!

"The brakes are too hard, we're going to capsize," society echoed with complaints.

"Society's economic express train has too much momentum, and now it's not even been slowed down," meanwhile, some observers of the macroeconomic situation were commenting.

In the same environment, the contrast in perceptions was so stark.

From a societal perspective, it is indeed true that the brakes have not been applied. The reporters saw the following figures at the Shenyang branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China: In October of last year, the bank, facing a severe situation of overdrafts amounting to several hundred million yuan, took emergency measures to recover 300 million yuan in loans. This amount accounts for only 4% of the total loans to industrial and commercial enterprises in the city. Even so, amidst the enterprises' cries, credit soon loosened again, and in November and December, Shenyang loaned out another 600 million yuan. This means that the money just recovered was lent out again, and even increased by 100%.

Why is the scale of credit so difficult to control? According to financial experts, just looking at the construction sector, there are two reasons. First, although the scale of construction has been reduced, not much money can be freed up. The Shenyang municipal government has cleared 56 construction projects. Some of these were projects without funds, and some were "half-finished" projects, with money already buried in the ground, making it impossible to recover. The second reason is that some projects are still being launched. For example, a certain district government office building, which was supposed to be halted, is still being funded and constructed at a rapid pace.

From a macro perspective, the scale of credit is still expanding, but from a micro perspective, many enterprises are indeed having a tough time.

During the interviews, some "bosses" complained to the reporters:

- Price increases have eroded part of the loans. Currently, the prices of various production materials have generally increased by more than 20% compared to the beginning of 1988. The prices of scarce raw materials such as copper and aluminum sheets have even doubled. A significant portion of the enterprise's loans have been eroded, causing the production funds to "shrink" from the purchase of raw materials to the delivery of products.

- New enterprises have developed excessively, and loans are dispersed. In early 1988, Shenyang saw a wave of "business fever" and "enterprise establishment fever." In the first nine months alone, the city established 16,000 new enterprises, an increase of 120% compared to the same period last year. Among these, processing and commercial enterprises were the most numerous. They have very limited self-funding and are all reaching out to banks for loans.

- The market environment is poor, and funds are turning over slowly. Shenyang's economy is based on mechanical processing, with a large amount of raw materials depending on external sources, and finished products mainly sold outside the city. Now, raw materials are a seller's market. For example, the Jinbei Automobile Company's order for steel plates for 1989, and the Shenyang Transformer Factory's order for silicon steel sheets for 1989, the sellers all require prepayment before the end of 1988; while mechanical and electrical products are a buyer's market, often the goods arrive, but the other party delays payment. This is an important reason why many enterprises in Shenyang have poor loan utilization effects. From January to September 1988, the turnover days for industrial quota working capital in Shenyang was 121 days, far exceeding the national average.

It can be seen that the current shortage of enterprise funds, in addition to external factors, also has internal factors that cannot be ignored, that is, the structure is unreasonable, the turnover of funds is slow, the utilization rate is low, and therefore, no matter how much is invested, it still feels insufficient.

"To calm the financial fluctuations, the key is to adjust the credit structure." Sun Xuebin, the president of the Shenyang branch of the People's Bank of China and a senior economist, gave a simple analogy: Now that the feed is insufficient, and both roosters and hens are opening their beaks to eat, what should we do? We can only prioritize, and kill the roosters to save the hens. Among the hens, we also need to differentiate levels, first save the breeding hens (referring to energy, transportation, and raw material industries), then save the egg-laying hens (referring to foreign exchange-earning enterprises, enterprises producing high-quality branded products, and enterprises producing products closely related to people's lives).

Now the entire economy is facing such an adjustment opportunity, unfortunately, because we have not yet established a true competitive elimination mechanism, nor do we have a sound social security system, therefore, the adjustment is very difficult, the more the roosters cry, the more they want to be saved.

Some administrative leaders also fear causing trouble, and are used to dividing the porridge like an old monk, giving each person a spoonful. Additionally, there is a strange phenomenon: foreign enterprises borrow loans very cautiously, while our factory directors and managers are unusually bold, borrowing money like robbing it, because the loan interest rate is too low, only accounting for 3% of the production cost, if you don't borrow it, you lose it. Some financial experts suggest raising the loan interest rate, forcing those "roosters" to withdraw.

The reality is clear, we must not "inflate and then compress, compress and then shout, shout and then loosen, loosen and then inflate."

Otherwise, we will miss a good opportunity.

　　并非“刹车过猛”　而是“拢闸”不够
    ——沈阳“金融波动”思索录之一
    新华社记者  何大新  沈阳日报记者  陈大光
    １９８８年，对沈阳来说，是个多事之秋。抢购风刚刚趋缓，金融界又出现波动。
    农业银行，头寸不足；
    工商银行，透支严重；
    建设银行，信贷停摆。
    银行一直是经济建设的“钱柜子”，从来是要钱给钱，痛快得很。今天，这是怎么啦？
    事件的起因，大家似乎都清楚：近年，经济发展过热，引起通货膨胀，治理通货膨胀，就要紧缩银根，控制信贷规模。沈阳市政府近几个月根据国家部署，相继压缩了基建和生产贷款，这一举动对于过热的经济增长，确实起到了减速的作用。然而，接踵而来的是，企业纷纷告急，众多厂长、经理通过各种渠道发出呼声：企业资金周转失灵，已无钱购买原材料，生产要大滑坡！
    “刹车太猛了，要翻船的。”社会响起一片抱怨声。
    “社会经济快车惯性太大，现在根本没有拢住闸。”与此同时，一些洞察宏观形势的人士却在这样议论。
    同处一个现实环境，上下感觉的反差竟然如此强烈。
    从社会总体看，确实没有拢住闸。记者在沈阳市工商银行看到这样一组数字：去年１０月，该行在“透支”几个亿的严峻态势下，采取紧急措施，收回了贷款３个亿。这个数仅占全市工商企业贷款总额的４％。即使这样，在企业一片叫喊声中，很快信贷又有所松动，１１、１２两个月，沈阳市又相继贷出６个亿，这就是说，刚收回来的钱又放了出去，而且还加了１倍。
    信贷规模为何控制不住？据金融界人士分析，仅从基建方面来看，就有两种原因，一是基建规模虽然压缩了，但钱却腾不出来多少。沈阳市政府清理了５６个在建项目。有的本属无资金项目，有的是“半截子”工程，钱已埋进了地里，无法收回。另一原因是，有些项目还在继续上马，如某区政府办公楼本已列入停建之列，但他们仍在筹集资金，加紧施工。
    从宏观看，信贷规模仍在扩大，而从微观分析，诸多企业眼下的日子确实过得很紧巴。
    在采访中，一些“老板们”向记者诉苦：
    ——物价上涨溶掉部分贷款。目前，各种生产资料的价格普遍比１９８８年初增加２０％以上，铜、铝金属薄板等紧缺原材料的价格甚至翻了一番，企业的相当一部分贷款被溶掉，致使生产资金从原材料采购到产品出门循环一次，“消瘦”一圈。
    ——新企业超量发展，贷款投向分散。１９８８年初，沈阳市掀起一股“经商热”和“办企业热”，仅１至９月，全市就新办１．６万个，比去年同期增长１．２倍。这其中又以加工业和经商为多。他们自有资金十分有限，纷纷向银行伸手讨借。
    ——市场环境不佳，资金周转缓慢。沈阳市的经济以机械加工业为支柱，原材料大量依赖外地，产成品又主要靠销往市外。如今，原材料是卖方市场。如金杯汽车公司订购１９８９年的钢板，沈阳变压器厂订购１９８９年的矽钢片，卖方都要求在１９８８年底前交上预付款；而机电产品又是买方市场，往往货到了，对方仍迟迟不转款。这是沈阳市许多企业贷款利用效果不佳的重要症结。１９８８年１至９月，沈阳市工业定额流动资金周转天数为１２１天，大大高于全国平均水平。
    由此可见，目前企业资金不足，除了有外部原因外，还有不可忽略的内部因素，那就是结构不合理，资金周转缓慢，利用率低，因而投放得再多也觉得总量不足。
    “要平息金融波动，关键在于调整信贷结构。”中国人民银行沈阳市分行行长、高级经济师孙学彬打了个通俗的比喻：现在饲料不足，而公鸡、母鸡都张嘴要食吃，怎么办呢？只好分出轻重缓急，来个杀公鸡，保母鸡。在母鸡中也要分出档次，先保种鸡（指能源交通、原材料工业），再保产蛋鸡（指创汇企业、生产优质名牌和与人民生活密切相关的产品的企业）。
    现在整个经济就面临这样的调整契机，可惜，由于我们尚未建立起真正的竞争淘汰机制，也没有一个健全的社会保障体系，因此调整起来很难，越是公鸡叫唤得越欢。
    一些行政领导也怕闹出乱子，惯于搞老和尚分粥，一人一勺。另外，还有一个怪异的现象，国外的企业借贷款十分审慎，而我们的厂长、经理却胆大得出奇，借钱像抢钱，因为贷款利率太低，仅占生产成本的３％，不借白不借。一些金融专家建议，提高贷款利率，迫使那些“公鸡”自己缩脖。
    现实形势很清楚，我们切不可“一胀就压，一压就叫，一叫就松，一松又胀。”
    否则，我们就会坐失良机。
