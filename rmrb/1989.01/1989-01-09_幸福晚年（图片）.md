Rural reforms have brought prosperity to Hongqi Village in Changzheng Township, Jiading County, Shanghai. Each laborer here earns an average annual income of 6,700 yuan. Elderly people who have lost their ability to work receive a monthly pension of 112 yuan and have all their medical expenses reimbursed.

Look, these elderly farmers who have come to collect their pensions are smiling so happily.

    幸福晚年
    农村改革使上海嘉定县长征乡红旗村富裕起来，这里每个劳动力平均年收入为6700元。失去劳动力的老人每月有112元退休金，还可报销全部医疗费用。
    你看，这些前来领取退休金的老农们笑得多欢畅。
