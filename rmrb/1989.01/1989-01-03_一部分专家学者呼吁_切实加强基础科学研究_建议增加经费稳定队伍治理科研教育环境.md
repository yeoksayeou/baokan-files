Some experts and scholars today called for taking concrete and feasible measures to emphasize and strengthen the research of basic sciences, especially applied basic sciences.

These experts and scholars are representatives attending the Fifth National Congress of the China Democratic National Construction Association held in Beijing. They believe that in recent years, China's basic scientific research has achieved great success, especially in building the electron-positron collider and dozens of national scientific laboratories. However, the current state of basic sciences is not optimistic. Shi Mao Xu, Vice Chairman of the National Natural Science Foundation Committee and a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that modern construction cannot be separated from advanced science and technology, and the development of science and technology depends on the level of basic scientific research. Without a high level of advanced basic sciences, it is unrealistic to achieve modernization and develop China's economy and construction.

Currently, China's basic scientific research still lags far behind the advanced countries in the world. Huang Ji Qing, Honorary President of the Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences and a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that in 1987, China's scientific research funding was over 10 billion yuan, but only four to five hundred million yuan was used for basic scientific research, accounting for only about 5%, far lower than the 10% to 15% proportion of developed countries in the world. The lack of scientific research funding directly affects the quality and level of scientific research. Cheng Yu Qi, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences and a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that the basic scientific research funding of various countries in the world is mainly provided by the state, and our country should resolutely increase the funding for basic scientific research.

Ge Ting Xiang, Honorary Director of the Institute of Solid State Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that a new "uselessness of studying" theory has emerged in society. Due to harsh working conditions and low pay, many young and middle-aged scientific and technological talents have left their basic research positions, gone abroad, started businesses, or turned to applied technology and development research with quick results and high benefits, making basic research lack successors. Currently, China has more than 9 million scientific and technological personnel, but less than 100,000 are engaged in basic scientific research, which is a crisis that cannot be ignored. Wu Jia Ping, Honorary President of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that we must take concrete measures to strengthen the cultivation of talents in basic scientific research and stabilize the basic scientific research team. Otherwise, China's basic scientific research will face a frightening blank, forming a gap, directly endangering the development of the entire science and technology and economic construction.

Xu Xi, a professor at Chengdu University of Science and Technology, believes that it is necessary to strengthen the macro-control of basic scientific research and use macro-control means to ensure the development of basic scientific research. He suggested that the scientific research and educational environment should also be rectified and regulated.

### 一部分专家学者呼吁  切实加强基础科学研究  建议增加经费稳定队伍治理科研教育环境

　　一部分专家学者呼吁
    切实加强基础科学研究
    建议增加经费稳定队伍治理科研教育环境
    新华社北京１月２日电  （记者郑庆东）部分专家学者今天呼吁：要采取切实可行的措施，重视和加强对基础科学特别是应用基础科学的研究。
    这些专家学者是出席在京举行的九三学社第五次全国代表大会的会议代表。他们认为，近年来我国的基础科学研究工作取得了很大成绩，特别是建起了正负电子对撞机和数十个国家科学实验室，但是基础科学的现状不容乐观。国家自然科学基金拨款委员会副主任、中科院学部委员师冒绪说，现代化的建设离不开发达的科学技术，而科学技术的发展又取决于基础科学研究的水平。没有较高的、先进的基础科学要实现现代化、要发展我国的经济和建设是不切实际的。
    目前我国的基础科学研究与世界先进发达国家相比仍有很大差距。中国地质科学院名誉院长、学部委员黄汲清说，１９８７年我国的科研经费是１００多亿元，而其中用于基础科学研究的只有四五亿元，仅占５％左右，远远低于世界发达国家１０％至１５％的比重，科研经费的不足直接影响了科研的质量和水平。中国地质科学院研究员、学部委员程裕淇说，世界各国基础科学的研究经费均是由国家提供，我们国家应当下狠心增加基础科学研究的资金。
    中科院固体物理研究所名誉所长、学部委员葛庭燧说，现在社会上出现了新的“读书无用论”，由于工作条件比较艰苦、待遇太低，许多中青年科技人才离开基础科研岗位，出国、经商或转向见效快、效益好的应用技术和开发研究上，使得基础科研后继乏人，后继无人。目前我国有９００多万名科技人员，而其中从事基础科学研究的不足１０万，这是一个不容忽视的危机。中国医学科学院名誉院长、学部委员吴阶平说，我们要采取切实措施，加强培养基础科学研究的人才，稳定基础科研队伍。否则，我国的基础科学研究就将出现一个可怕的空白，形成一个断层，直接危害整个科学技术的发展和经济建设。
    成都科技大学教授徐僖认为要加强对基础科学研究的宏观控制，用宏观调控的手段保证基础科研的发展。他建议对科学研究和教育环境也应该进行治理和整顿。
