Recently, several retired officials from Qishan Town in Nantong County wrote a letter to the county's Party secretary and mayor, reporting that some leaders from various departments in Nantong City and County often drive or bike to the fish ponds in Qishan Town to fish on their days off. On the busiest days, there can be dozens of people. Each time a fisherman comes, the town's enterprises have to pay the fish pond manager 3 yuan in compensation. The fish caught are then paid for by the town's aquaculture farm at 10 yuan per kilogram. At noon, the leaders of the town's enterprises also have to treat the fishermen to good wine and food. This behavior has a bad influence among the people.

The staff of Qishan Town's aquaculture farm said, "From May 17, 1988, to the end of November, we received 240 fishing visitors, and the accounts show that 525 kilograms of fish were caught."

The leaders of several enterprises in Qishan Town have even more to complain about.

One enterprise leader said, "Thinking back, the first to come to our factory asking for a fish pond to fish was someone from Nantong City's traffic department. They control the traffic lights, so even if we don't want to welcome them, we have to. Later, some relevant personnel from the city and county departments that oversee us also came. The most frequent visitors are from the county's power supply and materials departments; they control the fate of our town enterprises, so we have to 'welcome them all.' Sometimes, the fish pond lessees don't welcome them and secretly feed the fish first. The fish don't bite, the guests get tired legs and sore eyes, and can't catch any fish, which makes them very unhappy. We have to both smile and make arrangements. After they have had enough to eat and drink, we buy some fish for them to take home, trying to make sure they leave happily."

　　各路“菩萨”悠然垂钓　乡镇“小庙”有苦难言
    最近，南通县骑岸镇的几位离退休老同志，写信给县委书记和县长，反映南通市、县一些部门的负责人，一到休息天就开车或骑车到骑岸镇一些鱼塘钓鱼，最多的一天有几十人。每来一位钓鱼人，镇办企业就要向鱼塘管理人交３元误工费，钓到的鱼再由镇办企业按每公斤１０元的价格支付给镇水产养殖场。中午，镇办企业领导人还要用好酒好菜招待垂钓者。这种行为在群众中影响很坏。
    骑岸镇水产养殖场的同志说：“从１９８８年５月１７日到１１月底，我们共接待垂钓客２４０人次，账面上反映出被钓走的鱼共计５２５公斤。”
    骑岸镇几个企业负责人谈起来苦处更多。
    一家企业领导人说：“细想起来，最早来我厂要求找鱼塘钓鱼的是南通市交通部门的人。红绿灯掌管在他们手里，我们不欢迎也得欢迎。后来，市、县一些管得着我们的部门的有关人员闻讯也来了。来的最多的是县供电部门、物资部门，他们掌握着我们镇办企业的命运，我们只能‘一律欢迎’。有时有的鱼塘承包者不欢迎他们，悄悄地先将鱼喂饱了。鱼不咬钩，客人蹲麻了腿，瞪酸了眼，钓不到鱼，很有意见。我们只得又陪笑脸，又打招呼。待他们酒足饭饱后，我们就买些鱼让他们带回去，尽量让他们高兴而归。　　　江苏南通大众报社　伊仁
