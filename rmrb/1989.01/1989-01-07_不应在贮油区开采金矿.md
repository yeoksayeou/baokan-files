Over the past few months, many farmers have been illegally mining for gold within the oil storage tank area under our department's jurisdiction. Large amounts of mud and stones have been washed by rainwater into the living area of our custody squad and the oil pipeline. One of the wells used for living water has been filled in. Some of the miners have even been detonating explosives near the oil storage tank area. If an accident were to occur, the consequences would be unimaginable.

　　不应在贮油区开采金矿
    近几个月来，不少农民在我部贮存油罐区内，乱挖滥采金矿，大量的泥沙、石块被雨水冲积到我部保管分队的生活区和输油管线处，一口生活用水井被填。一些采矿者还在贮存油罐区的附近放炮。一旦发生事故，后果将不堪设想。
