The sanitation system, which has traditionally been difficult to recruit for, has now become popular in Wuhan. At the start of the new year, Wuhan's sanitation system recruited 300 contract sanitation workers, attracting 800 applicants. This competition has raised the quality of the selected candidates, with one-quarter of the youth having a high school or vocational school education, and even five college graduates.

Deng Langgui, a responsible person at Wuhan's Sanitation Bureau, told reporters that in the past, the sanitation system had difficulty recruiting workers because this line of work was considered dirty, tiring, and without prospects. Now, with the optimization of various industries and the competition for survival of the fittest among enterprises, many young people's employment concepts have changed. Sweeping streets may be dirty and tiring, but it is more popular than those enterprises where people are worried about their next meal.

Intense job competition and the fact that schools no longer guarantee job placements are reasons why many highly educated young people have joined the sanitation workforce. Xu Yanyan, a graduate of Wuhan Radio and Television University, told reporters that her seniors, who had been looking for jobs in popular units for several years, were still unemployed. She frankly said, "Having a job is better than staying at home idle." However, how will they reconcile their years of hard study with their current jobs? The reporter asked this question to Kang Binbin, who had just started sweeping streets. This college graduate in Chinese language and literature seemed to have considered this question beforehand. She responded candidly that now the overall cultural level of society is improving, and the sanitation system also needs educated people to improve the environment and conditions. Her major may not be immediately useful, but it is not wasted as personal cultivation. In the future, she can work while familiarizing herself with life and understanding society, and also engage in creative writing in her spare time.

This issue has also drawn the attention of the leaders of the Sanitation Bureau. Deng Langgui admitted that being able to recruit people does not mean they will stay. To attract more young people with good qualities to voluntarily work in the sanitation system, it also depends on whether the sanitation department can provide them with a broad field for their talents.

　　就业竞争激烈　择业观念变化
    武汉一批大中专毕业生当清洁工
    新华社武汉１月１２日电  （记者唐卫彬、熊金超）向来招工难的环卫系统，如今在武汉却走俏起来。新年伊始，武汉市环卫系统招收３００名合同制清洁工，竟有８００名竞争者。这一争，使被录取者的素质提高了，其中有１／４的青年是高中或中专以上文化程度，还有五名大专毕业生。
    武汉市环卫局负责人邓朗奎对记者说，过去环卫系统招工总是招不满，都嫌这一行又脏又累，没出息。如今行行业业搞优化组合，企业都面临着优胜劣汰的竞争，许多青年的择业观也发生了变化，扫马路虽然脏点累点，但总比那些“吃了上顿愁下顿的企业”受欢迎。
    就业竞争激烈和学校不包分配，是许多文化程度高的青年投入环卫工人队伍的原因之一。市电大毕业生徐燕燕告诉记者，她前几届的同学，有的因为找工作总钻热门单位，几年了还在待业。她坦率地说：“有工作总比在家闲着强。”但是，他们将怎么处理自己苦读几年的专业和本职工作的矛盾呢？记者向已经开始上街清扫马路的康彬彬提出了这个疑问。这位汉语言文学专业毕业的大专生对此似乎早有考虑，她爽快地回答，现在全社会的文化水平都在提高，环卫系统也需要有文化的人来改善环境和条件。我学的专业可能一时用不上，但作为自身的一种修养并不浪费。将来边工作，边熟悉生活、了解社会，还可以业余搞创作。
    这个问题同样也引起市环卫局领导的注意。邓朗奎承认，现在招得进不等于今后留得住。要想使更多有良好素质的青年自愿来环卫系统工作，还要看环卫部门本身能否为他们提供广阔的用武之地。
