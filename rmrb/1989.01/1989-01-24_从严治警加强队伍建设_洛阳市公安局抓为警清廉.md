In the process of deepening police reforms, the Public Security Bureau of Luoyang City in Henan Province has actively accepted public supervision, starting with strict management of law enforcement personnel, striving to maintain a clean and honest police force, and strengthening the construction of the police team.

In July of last year, Mayor Song Wenzhi of the Public Security Bureau received a letter from a citizen reporting that a private entrepreneur from Jiangsu Province, Wu Shaobing, had an economic dispute with the Luoyang Glass Factory sales department in Shangqiu City, Henan Province. The West District Public Security Sub-bureau had detained Wu for investigation in violation of policies and laws. The situation described in the letter alerted Song Wenzhi, who went directly to the detention center to meet with the parties involved and then checked with the handling unit to verify the situation. It was confirmed that the information in the letter was accurate. Song Wenzhi immediately ordered the release of Wu and quickly investigated the handling process of the case. It turned out that the other party involved in the dispute with Wu Shaobing, in order to demand money, privately asked a police officer from the Suburban District Public Security Sub-bureau to help contact the case. As a result, the police officer who intervened in the case was investigated, and the sub-bureau leadership was ordered to reflect on their handling of the case involving relationships and personal favors.

The Public Security Bureau of Luoyang City has strictly required law enforcement personnel, which has effectively promoted the construction of the police team. Statistics show that over the past year, 1,017 police officers in the city have refused bribes and gifts totaling 1,956 items, with a total value of over 70,000 yuan, and have refused invitations to dine 2,841 times. During the investigation of a hooligan crime case in Luanchuan County, the family members of the criminal sought help from a relative of the county's Public Security Bureau chief, Li Dehui, and left an envelope on the table before leaving. Li Dehui thought it contained information and opened it to find 2,000 yuan. Li Dehui handed the money over to the bureau's political office and handled the criminal according to law.

　　从严治警加强队伍建设
    洛阳市公安局抓为警清廉
    本报讯  河南省洛阳市公安局在深化公安改革中，自觉接受群众监督，从对执法者从严抓起，努力做到为警清廉，加强了队伍建设。
    去年７月，市公安局长宋文学接到一封群众来信，反映江苏省个体户吴绍兵与河南省商丘市驻洛阳玻璃厂经销部发生经济纠纷，西工区公安分局违反政策法令，将吴收容审查。信中反映的情况引起宋文学的警觉，他直接到拘留所与当事人见了面，又找办案单位核实情况，证明来信反映的情况属实。宋文学当即指示放人，并很快查清了此案承办经过。原来，与吴绍兵发生纠纷的另一方为向其索要钱款，私下托郊区公安分局一个民警帮忙联系后，西工分局受理了此案。为此，出面联系办案的民警受到审查，分局领导也因办关系案、人情案被责令检查。
    洛阳市公安局对执法者从严要求，有力地促进了队伍建设。据统计，一年来，全市公安干警有１０１７人次拒贿、拒收礼品１９５６件，总价值达７万余元，拒吃请２８４１人次。栾川县公安局在查处一起流氓犯罪案件时，犯罪分子的家属托县公安局长李德禄的亲戚去说情，临走时将一个信封放在了桌子上。李德禄以为里面是交待材料，打开一看，竟是２０００元人民币。李德禄把钱交到局政办室，依法处理了犯罪分子。
