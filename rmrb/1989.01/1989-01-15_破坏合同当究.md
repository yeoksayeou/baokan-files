Currently, there is a strange phenomenon in economic work: some enterprises do not abide by contracts themselves, delay delivery times, but instead demand "rush fees" from users. Recently, the author heard in Shandong that a manager said their factory had ordered equipment from a certain enterprise in the south, with all contract procedures in place. When it was time to pick up the goods, they were met with a "closed door," with the other party using excuses like "material shortages" and "power shortages" to demand over ten million yuan in cash (not accepting checks) as "overtime pay." If the money was not given, the delivery would become a mere bubble.

They themselves delayed the contract, should have compensated the customer for the loss, why did they turn around and demand money with a straight face? It turns out that this is because their products are in high demand, "the emperor's daughter is not worried about getting married."

Long-term, stable economic cooperation is beneficial to the development of enterprises. Far-sighted entrepreneurs have always regarded users as "God." The more popular the goods, the better the service, the better the enterprise's reputation. Because the market is always changing, today's popular goods may not be popular tomorrow. With the continuous adjustment of the industrial structure, the supply and demand relationship of some products will change. A certain factory in Northeast China had products that were popular in the Shandong market in the past. Later, relying on being a "princess," they often breached contracts, damaging relationships with users, and quickly lost in the competition, regretting it to this day. This lesson should be a warning to enterprises that arbitrarily collect "rush fees."

It is not commendable to unreasonably breach contracts, and it is also too weak to suffer losses and passively accept them. This shows that some enterprises are not good at protecting their rights through legal means. Some say: "We dare not sue, fearing retaliation." In fact, the Contract Law is a serious economic regulation. If everyone uses legal weapons, the power of the law will be demonstrated. On the contrary, if everyone hesitates and fears, treating the law as a joke, enterprises and individuals who bully the honest will become more arrogant.

### 破坏合同当究

　　破坏合同当究
    墨村
    目前，经济工作中有种怪现象：一些企业自家无理不遵守合同，延误供货期限，却反向用户强行收取“赶工费”。最近，笔者在山东听到一位经理说，他们厂在南方某企业定购的设备，合同手续一应俱全，到期取货时却吃了“闭门羹”，对方以原料紧张、电力不足为由，硬要去他们十多万元现钞（不收支票），当作“加班费”发放。若是不给钱，交货就成了泡影。
    自己误了合同，本应赔偿客户的损失，为什么反过来还理直气壮、伸手讨钱呢？原来，这是由于他们的产品俏，“皇帝的女儿不愁嫁”。
    长远的、稳固的经济合作，有利于企业的发展。有远见的企业家，从来都是视用户为“上帝”的。货越俏，服务越佳，企业信誉越好。因为市场总在变化，眼前的俏货，过一段就不见得再俏。随着产业结构的不断调整，一些产品的供求关系会发生变化。东北某工厂产品过去在山东市场看好，后来自恃是“公主”，动辄违背合同，伤害了同用户的关系，很快在竞争中败下阵来，至今遗憾不已。这个教训应令滥收“赶工费”的企业借鉴。
    无理违约不足取，吃了亏还逆来顺受也实在太软弱。它说明一些企业不善于依法维护权宜。有人说：“我们不敢告，怕穿小鞋。”其实，《合同法》是严肃的经济法规，大家都来运用法律武器，法的力量就会显示；反之，大家都瞻前顾后，畏首畏尾，视法律为儿戏的企业和个人就会愈加欺负老实人。
