The Libyan government today requested that the United Nations Security Council convene an emergency meeting to discuss the "aggressive act" of the U.S. Air Force shooting down two Libyan aircraft over the Mediterranean this morning. The Security Council has scheduled a consultation meeting for tomorrow morning to consider this issue.

This request was made by Libya's Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Ali Senny Montasser, on behalf of his government, in a letter to the January chairman of the Security Council, Malaysian Ambassador Razali Ismail. A statement issued by the Libyan Foreign Ministry today and distributed at the United Nations pointed out that the shooting down of the Libyan aircraft was a "premeditated attack" and called on the international community to stop the U.S. Navy's military exercises in the international waters near Libya, which have aggressive intentions.

United Nations Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar today expressed regret over the shooting down of the Libyan aircraft by the U.S. Air Force and hoped that both sides would exercise restraint to prevent further escalation of tensions in the region.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Tunis on January 4, the Libyan News Agency reported that Libya today requested the Arab League Council of Ministers to hold an emergency special meeting on the incident of the U.S. shooting down two Libyan aircraft and called on the international community to intervene urgently to stop the U.S. aggression against Libyan territory and force the U.S. to withdraw its military forces from the region.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Tunis on January 5, the Libyan News Agency reported that Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi wrote a letter to the Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, informing him of the situation regarding the shooting down of two Libyan reconnaissance aircraft by the U.S. Gaddafi said that the U.S. military actions threaten the peace of the Mediterranean and the world. He called on Mugabe to work to stop the U.S. aggression and prevent such incidents from happening again.

Libya also sent similar letters to the Organization of African Unity and the Islamic Conference Organization.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Tunis on January 4, Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi said today that no matter how strong the U.S. aggression is, it cannot force Libya to abandon its principles or the goals of Arab national unity, liberation, and progress.

Gaddafi said that Libya will retaliate against this act of aggression by the U.S.
