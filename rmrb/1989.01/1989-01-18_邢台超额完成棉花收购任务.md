Xingtai Exceeds Cotton Procurement Target

XINGTAI — Known as the "cotton sea," the Xingtai region of Hebei Province has led the province in cotton production and procurement for six consecutive years since 1983. In 1988, the region again saw a good cotton harvest. By January 13 of this year, Xingtai had procured 118.55 million kilograms of cotton, exceeding the target by 7.8 million kilograms. It is one of the two regions in the country to have completed the state cotton procurement contract ahead of schedule.

In 1988, Xingtai's cotton procurement work faced unprecedented challenges. Various localities rushed to establish small cotton ginning mills and went to the countryside to procure cotton. The "cotton war" flared up again.

Faced with such a complex cotton procurement situation, the Xingtai Party Committee, the administrative office, the supply and marketing cooperative, and relevant departments took practical measures to ensure the completion of the cotton procurement task. They maintained unified political leadership, strictly managed the market, and emphasized the implementation of national policies, allowing the supply and marketing cooperative to be the sole operator of cotton. They also carried out thorough and detailed ideological and political work among the masses, and played a leading role for party members and young pioneers. The entire region had more than 40,000 party members, young pioneers, and cadres and workers who took the lead in selling 4.25 million kilograms of cotton.

　　邢台超额完成棉花收购任务
    本报邢台电  记者李建兴报道：素有棉海之称的邢台地区棉花产量、收购额自１９８３年以来连续６年名列河北省第一。１９８８年该区棉花又获得较好收成。截止今年元月１３日，邢台地区共收购棉花１１８５５万公斤，超额７８０万公斤，是全国率先完成棉花合同定购任务的两个地区之一。
    １９８８年，邢台地区棉花收购工作面临多年未遇的困难。各地纷纷自建小轧花厂，下乡收购棉花。一时“棉花大战”再起。
    面对如此复杂的棉花收购形势，邢台地委、行署、供销社及有关部门采取切实措施，保证棉花收购任务完成。保持政令统一，严格市场管理，强调执行国家政策，棉花由供销社一家经营。深入细致做好群众思想政治工作，发挥党团员带头作用。全区有４万多名党团员和干部职工带头交售棉花４２５万公斤。
