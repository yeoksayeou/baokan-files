The national conference on primary and secondary school libraries proposed that every school must have a library. Wang Nemei reported from Beijing on January 5 that Deputy Minister of the State Education Commission, Liu Bin, said at the opening of the national conference on primary and secondary school libraries today that every school must have a library, which is one of the necessary conditions for implementing compulsory education.

Currently, many primary and secondary schools do not have libraries (rooms), and the ownership rate of books among students is also very low. This phenomenon is even more serious in rural primary and secondary schools.

Liu Bin urged local authorities to strengthen the construction of primary and secondary school libraries. Schools must build good book repositories when constructing school buildings, and the number of books must continue to increase. He said: "These will be the necessary conditions for implementing the Compulsory Education Law. That is, on the basis of the original 'one without (no dangerous buildings) and two with (classrooms and desks and chairs),' add three matching sets: school building matching (with laboratories, instrument rooms, book reading rooms, and kitchens, toilets, etc.); equipment matching (teaching instruments, books and materials, sports equipment, etc.); and teacher matching (each subject teacher must be in place according to the number of students, and further requirements for academic qualifications). These conditions will be written into the implementation details of the Compulsory Education Law in the form of laws."

This national conference on primary and secondary school libraries was convened by the State Education Commission. More than 80 officials from the education departments of 27 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, and 11 separately planned municipalities attended the meeting.

　　全国中小学图书馆工作会议提出
    每所中小学必须设图书馆
    本报北京１月５日讯  记者王娜梅报道：国家教委副主任柳斌在今天开幕的全国中小学图书馆工作会议上说，每所中小学要有图书馆，这是实施义务教育的必备条件之一。
    目前，不少中小学没有图书馆（室），学生对图书的占有率也很低。在农村中小学，这一现象更为严重。
    柳斌要求各地加强中小学图书馆的建设。中小学建校舍同时一定要建设好书库，藏书量要不断增加。他说：“这些将作为实施义务教育法的必备条件。即在原来‘一无（无危房）两有（有教室、有桌凳）’的基础上再加上三配套：校舍配套（有实验室、仪器室、图书阅览室以及厨房、厕所等）；设备配套（教学仪器、图书资料、文体器材等）；师资配套（按学生人数配齐各科教师，进一步要求学历达标）。这些条件将以法律形式规定下来写进义务教育法的实施细则。”
    这次全国中小学图书馆工作会议是由国家教委召开的。全国２７个省、市、自治区和１１个计划单列市教育部门的８０余名负责人出席了会议。
