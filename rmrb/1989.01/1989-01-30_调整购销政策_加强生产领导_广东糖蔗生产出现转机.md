	Adjusting Purchase and Sales Policies and Strengthening Production Leadership: Guangdong's Sugarcane Production Shows Signs of Improvement

	The People's Daily reports: Correspondent Liang Zhaoming reports: Guangdong Province, the largest sugarcane production area in China, adjusted its sugarcane purchase and sales policies last year while strengthening leadership over sugarcane production. This mobilized the enthusiasm of farmers, thereby reversing the trend of declining total sugarcane production over the past two years.

	According to statistics from relevant provincial departments recently, Guangdong increased its sugarcane planting area by nearly 100,000 mu last year, bringing the total planting area to over 3.5 million mu. The total production and average yield per mu both increased by 8.15% and 5.67% respectively compared to 1987.

	In recent years, cities like Foshan, Zhongshan, Guangzhou, and Dongguan, which have seen significant declines in sugarcane production, have taken measures to reverse this trend. They have allocated substantial funds to subsidize sugarcane production and reward high-yield activities. For example, Shunde County implemented the "industry subsidizing agriculture, high-yield subsidizing low-yield" approach, allocating 18 million yuan to subsidize sugarcane production. Due to these effective measures, farmers engaged in sugarcane production have benefited, and from the eastern coastal areas of Guangdong to the western mountainous regions, farmers' enthusiasm for planting sugarcane has been growing.

　　调整购销政策　加强生产领导
    广东糖蔗生产出现转机
    本报讯  记者梁兆明报道：我国最大的糖蔗产区广东省，去年在调整糖蔗购销政策的同时，加强对糖蔗生产的领导，调动农民积极性，从而扭转了连续两年糖蔗总产量下降的局面。
    据省有关部门近日统计，去年广东增加甘蔗种植面积近１０万亩，使全省种植总面积达到３５０多万亩，总产和平均亩产比１９８７年分别增长８．１５％和５．６７％。
    近年糖蔗生产下降幅度较大的佛山、中山、广州、东莞等市，为了扭转这个局面而拨出大笔专款，补贴甘蔗生产和奖励创高产活动，其中顺德县实行“以工补农，以高补低”的办法，拨出１８００万元补贴甘蔗生产。由于措施有力，从事糖蔗生产的农民得到甜头，从粤东沿海到粤西山区，农民种植甘蔗的积极性越来越高涨。
