In the winter, Qinghai Province's Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture is covered in a pristine white blanket. I followed the Longmu River southward and arrived at the home of repatriated Tibetan Ka Mao Jia Grandma.

She lives in Longmu Town, Sihouji Village, Tongren County, the prefecture's administrative center. I knocked on the unvarnished wooden door, and the yellow dog tied at the entrance started barking wildly. The 57-year-old Ka Mao Jia Grandma, holding a rosary, has a slender yet agile figure. She smiled as she opened the door, scolded the dog away, and welcomed the guest into a newly built brick-and-wood structure.

Just then, the door creaked open again, and Grandma's beloved daughter, Zhuoma Lajia, entered the courtyard. The 20-year-old Zhuoma teaches English at the county's middle school and has also learned Mandarin, making her the perfect translator for us. Grandma spoke, and her daughter translated:

"Thirty years ago, my husband and I left home. We wandered for 10 years and had our only daughter in the Tibetan settlement of Meixi Village, India. To support the three of us, we bought sweaters, clothes, and handicrafts from Nepalese merchants to sell in India. We saved money to send our daughter to school. Zhuoma started school at 8 and studied up to the seventh grade. We thought: we should let the child return to her motherland. In April 1983, we agreed with three fellow villagers to take the train to Nepal, then cross the mountains to Lhasa.

"When we returned to the country, Zhuoma was 15 years old and was overjoyed to see the magnificent Potala Palace. We then took a bus from Lhasa to Xining. The province warmly arranged for us to visit the Tara Temple, tour factories, and finally returned to the town in June."

Zhuoma continued, "The homeland is even more beautiful than in my dreams. The ancient and magnificent Longmu Temple is connected to the village, with buildings, factories, shops, schools, and the beautiful Longmu River everywhere. After returning for three months, the prefecture knew I had studied English abroad since childhood and recommended me to the provincial education college for further studies. My parents, with their years of savings, built 10 flat-roofed houses with the help of the government. The following May, just as the new house was completed, my father fell ill with cancer and passed away before the end of the year."

Ka Mao Jia Grandma looked sad, "Tibetan people are used to hardships. Now I sincerely pray and chant scriptures, wishing for Zhuoma's success. In September 1986, she graduated and was assigned to teach English at the prefecture's ethnic minority normal school. Last May, she was invited to teach at the county's middle school. Seeing her contribute to the country, I have the energy to do anything."

Zhuoma, while pouring tea for me, excitedly told me, "Grandma is a kind-hearted person who often visits nearby repatriated Tibetans, helping with weddings, funerals, childbirth, and other matters. She is also open-minded and was elected as a member of the prefecture's Political Consultative Conference in September 1987. She also visited and toured Beijing. Last year, Grandma had pneumonia, and the prefecture government provided 200 yuan in assistance. With Zhuoma's monthly salary of 155 yuan, it is enough for the mother and daughter to live. Grandma always says, 'It's still better in the motherland.'"

Before I knew it, it was already two in the afternoon. Taking advantage of the strong sunlight on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, I took out my "idiot" camera. Grandma, seeing that I wanted to take a photo, happily opened the chest at the head of the bed and took out her daughter's Tibetan robe. Soon, Zhuoma, dressed in a green jacket and a Tibetan robe with mink trim, came over, like a blooming snow lotus, happily standing with her mother under the eaves, smiling at the camera...

　　隆务河畔藏人家
    本报记者　郅振璞
    冬日里，青海省黄南藏族自治州银装素裹。我沿隆务河南去，来到归国藏胞卡毛加大妈家。
    她住在州府所在地同仁县隆务镇四后集村。叩响尚未油漆的大门，拴在门口的黄狗便一阵狂叫。５７岁的卡毛加大妈手托念珠，略瘦的身材健朗灵活。她一边笑着开门，一边斥退黄狗，把客人迎进一排砖木结构的新房。
    这时，门又“吱”的一声，大妈的宝贝女儿卓玛拉毛闪进院里。２０岁的卓玛姑娘在县民中教英语，又自学汉语，正好给我们当翻译。大妈娓娓而谈，女儿细细翻译：
    “３０年前，我和丈夫离家出国。在外漂泊了１０年，在印度麦索村藏人居民点添了独生女儿。为照顾３口人的嘴巴，我们从尼泊尔商人那里，买些毛衣、服装、工艺品，到印度去卖。攒下些钱财供女儿上学。卓玛８岁入学，上到七年级，我们想：应该让孩子回到祖国去。１９８３年４月，我们相约了三家乡亲，先乘火车到尼泊尔，然后翻山到了拉萨。
    “回国时卓玛１５岁，看到辉煌的布达拉宫，比谁都高兴。我们又从拉萨搭班车到西宁，省里热情安排大家上塔尔寺叩拜，参观工厂，直到６月才回到镇上。”
    卓玛姑娘接着说：“家乡，比梦中的还美。古老宏伟的隆务寺和村镇相连，到处是楼房、工厂、商店、学校，还有秀丽的隆务河。回来３个月，州里知我从小在国外学英语，就推荐我上省教育学院进修。爸妈拿着多年积蓄，在政府帮助下盖了１０间平房。第二年５月，刚建起新家院，爸爸却患了癌症，不到年底就离开了我们。”
    卡毛加大妈一阵忧伤，“藏家人吃惯了苦，我现在虔诚地拜佛念经，祝福卓玛学习成才。１９８６年９月，她一毕业就安排到州民族师范教英语。去年５月又被请到县民中代课。看到她能为祖国做贡献，我干啥浑身都有劲儿。”
    卓玛一边为我添茶，一边兴奋地告诉我，阿妈是个热心人，经常到附近归国藏胞家问寒问暖，帮助乡亲料理婚丧嫁娶、生儿育女的事情，思想又开明，１９８７年９月被选为州政协委员，还参观游览了首都北京。去年，大妈害肺气喘，州政府给补助２００元，加上卓玛每月１５５元工资，够母女俩吃用。大妈总说：“在外还是没有祖国好哇。”
    不觉已是午后两点，趁着青海高原的强光，我拿出“傻瓜”相机，大妈见我要拍照，高兴地打开炕头箱子，取出女儿的藏袍。不一会儿，身穿翠绿小褂和水獭毛镶边藏袍的卓玛走过来，像一朵盛开的雪莲，高兴地和妈妈来到屋檐下，冲着照相机微笑起来……
