The 1989 World University Games will be held in a different location.

The International University Sports Federation decided at a meeting in Zagreb in August 1987 that the 15th World University Games would be held in Sao Paulo, Brazil, from August 19 to 30, 1989. However, the Brazilian government recently stated that Brazil faces financial difficulties in hosting this event.

The federation's secretary-general, Rock Campana, said that the federation had sent invitations to 10 cities to host this event at an emergency meeting in Rome last week. However, he did not disclose specific details.

　　巴西财经困难无力承办比赛  世界大学生运动会易地举行
    新华社北京１月２６日电  布鲁塞尔消息：今年的世界大学生运动会将易地举行。
    国际大学生体育联合会于１９８７年８月在萨格勒布会议上决定，第十五届世界大学生运动会将于今年８月１９日至３０日在巴西的圣保罗举行。但巴西政府最近提出，巴西承办这届运动会财经上有困难。
    该联合会秘书长罗克·康帕纳说，联合会在上周的罗马紧急会议上已向１０个城市发出了承办本届比赛的邀请。但他没有透露具体细节。
