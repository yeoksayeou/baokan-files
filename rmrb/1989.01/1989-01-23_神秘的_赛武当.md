The mysterious "Rival of Wudang"

Located in the northwest of Hubei Province, Wudang Mountain is a famous Taoist site in China. Its main peak, Tianzhuzhu, stands at an altitude of 1,612 meters, resembling a golden pillar carved from jade, towering above all other peaks. It is renowned for its "One Pillar Supporting the Sky" and is famous throughout the land. Few people know that 24 kilometers west of Wudang Mountain, there is another mountain that is even more towering and mysterious, known as the "Rival of Wudang." This mountain is characterized by its towering peaks and deep valleys, rich in wild plant resources, making it an ideal place for recreation.

The Rival of Wudang is situated within the jurisdiction of Xiaochuan Township in Shiyan City, covering a total area of 37 square kilometers. Its main peak, also named Rival of Wudang, stands at an altitude of 1,730 meters, which is 118 meters higher than the main peak of Wudang Mountain. Legend has it that the Rival of Wudang was originally named Fuling Mountain. In ancient times, the True Warrior Emperor stood atop Wudang Mountain, surveying the landscape, and noticed a mountain to the west that was higher than Wudang. He then drew his sword and cut off the peak of this mountain, causing the peak to fall into the nearby Maota River, forming an island in the river. However, this mountain was still higher than Wudang, so the original name of Fuling was changed to Rival of Wudang. What is puzzling is that the island in the Maota River and the plateau atop Fuling Mountain have almost the same area, and their stone quality and tree species are also very similar. All of this adds to the mystery of the Rival of Wudang.

The Rival of Wudang is composed of eight main ridges, including Maomao Mountain, Laxun Mountain, and Qingyan Mountain, along with numerous other ridges. These ridges are all in the shape of clustered peaks, with steep cliffs on all four sides, piercing the clouds, and covered with various rock pillars, rock platforms, rock caves, and rock holes, each with unique shapes. The top of the Rival of Wudang can be described as a "Brocade Ridge," featuring a large number of strange rocks, steep cliffs, rare flowers, and peculiar trees, such as "Stone Baby Crying to Heaven," "Chair Pine," "Sky Joy," "Flying Cloud Crossing," and "Green Dragon Raising Its Head." Standing at the top and looking around, one can see peaks and pillars in the clouds, with the sky and clouds blending into one, creating a magnificent and ever-changing scene.

The natural scenery conservation area of the Rival of Wudang has been relatively undisturbed by modern wars and excessive logging, hunting, and fishing, preserving its pristine, lush, and diverse natural landscape. There are about 20,000 mu of primitive forests here, with a forest coverage rate of over 80%. There are nearly 400 species of woody plants alone. The forest is filled with ancient pines, thousand-year-old cypresses, withered vines, green baskets, red willows, green bamboos, lantern trees, red beans, and giant purple wisteria, all of which are abundant. In the early summer, if you climb the Rival of Wudang, you will see the white Maoli trees, light green elm trees, small cork oak forests, and dark green Bashan pine forests, interspersed and spread out, forming a vast green sea. In the forest, rare birds and beasts such as golden money leopards, flower-faced civets, and golden snub-nosed monkeys appear and disappear, while giant salamanders swim in the clear streams and ponds. Pheasants and larks nest in the dense forests and tall bamboos, resembling a precious landscape of mountains and rivers.

Shiyan City is actively developing the tourism resources of the Rival of Wudang. Soon, it will unveil its mysterious and enchanting face.

　　神秘的“赛武当”
    程蕙芬
    位于湖北西北部的武当山，是我国道教胜地，主峰天柱峰，海拔１６１２米，犹如金铸玉琢的宝柱，鹤立众峰之上，素以“一柱擎天”名标天下。很少有人知道，在武当山以西２４公里处，还有一座比武当山更挺拔、更神秘的山，人称“赛武当”。那里峰丛矗立，峡谷幽深，野生植物资源丰富，是一处理想的游憩之所。
    赛武当山区位于十堰市小川乡境内，总面积３７平方公里，主峰赛武当，海拔１７３０米，比武当山主峰高１１８米。神话传说：赛武当原名伏龙山，昔日真武祖师伫立武当山顶，环顾远眺，见西边有一山高出武当，乃拔剑斩去此峰山顶，峰顶飘落在附近茅塔河，形成河中孤岛。但此山仍高过武当，遂废伏龙原名，更名赛武当。令人不解的是，茅塔河中孤岛与伏龙山顶平台的面积相差无几，石质、树种也一般无二，这一切，更增添了赛武当的神秘色彩。
    赛武当由八茅山、蜡烛山、青岩山等五条主要岭脊和其它众多岭脊组成。这些岭脊均呈峰丛形，四壁临空，直刺云汉，遍布的岩柱、岩墩、岩龛、岩洞，体态多姿。赛武当顶，可谓“锦绣岭”，赋存着大量异石、险崖、奇花、怪树，诸如“石娃叫天”、“椅子松”、“临空乐”、“飞云渡”、“青龙翘首”等。登高四顾，峰柱云海，云天一色，气象万千。
    赛武当自然风景保护区由于近代少受战争及滥砍滥采滥捕的破坏，保持了清新秀丽、森林茂密、珍稀种类共生、浑为一体的天然景色。这里约有２万亩的原始森林，森林覆盖率在８０％以上，仅木本植物就有近４００种，林中百年苍松、千年古杉、枯藤青箩红柳翠竹以及灯笼树，相思红豆，巨紫荆等观赏树木俯拾即是。初夏时节，你若登上赛武当，但见泛白的茅栗树，淡绿的榆树，小栓皮栎林，墨绿的巴山松林，镶嵌展布，汇成碧波万顷的林海。林中珍禽异兽如金钱豹，花面狸，金丝猴出没无常，大鲵（娃娃鱼）游于溪流清潭之中，锦鸡、画眉等栖息于茂林修竹之上，宛如一幅山岳风景珍品。
    十堰市正在积极开发赛武当的旅游资源，不久，就可以揭开她那层神秘动人的面纱了。
