The United Nations Secretary-General's Special Representative Begins His Trip to Northwest Africa

	BEIJING, Jan. 10 (Xinhua) — According to reports from our correspondents in Algiers and Rabat, the United Nations Secretary-General's Special Representative for the Western Sahara issue, Mr. Espiell, arrived in Casablanca, the economic capital of Morocco, on January 10. This marks the beginning of his trip to Northwest Africa to implement the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity's peace plan for resolving the Western Sahara conflict.

	Mr. Espiell's trip to Northwest Africa comes after the meeting between King Hassan II of Morocco and the high-level delegation of the Polisario Front in Marrakech.

	Upon his arrival, Mr. Espiell stated, "The latest developments in the Western Sahara issue indicate that the referendum can be held under good conditions of peace and justice," and that it "opens up positive prospects for lasting peace in the Western Sahara region." He emphasized that the main purpose of his visit is "to engage in dialogue, observe the current situation, and then report back to the Secretary-General."

	During his visit, Mr. Espiell will meet with King Hassan II in Marrakech on January 11. From January 12 to 14, he will meet with the Moroccan Administrator of Western Sahara in Aaiun. He will also hold talks with the leaders of the Polisario Front. Subsequently, he will visit Nouakchott and Algiers.

	After completing his trip, Mr. Espiell will proceed to Bamako to report his findings to Moussa Traoré, the Chairman of the Organization of African Unity.

	It is reported that two days ago, the United Nations Secretary-General, Javier Pérez de Cuéllar, met with a delegation from the Polisario Front in Paris. The delegation briefed him on the situation following the meeting between King Hassan II of Morocco and the Polisario Front delegation in Marrakech. After this meeting, there was optimism about the progress of implementing the peace plan of the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity. The Polisario Front believes that this meeting has paved the way for reaching a "comprehensive and final agreement."

　　贯彻联合国关于解决西撒冲突计划
    联合国秘书长特别代表开始西北非之行
    新华社北京一月十日电  综合本社驻阿尔及尔和拉巴特记者报道：联合国秘书长关于解决西撒问题的特别代表埃斯皮埃尔十日抵达摩洛哥经济首都卡萨布兰卡，开始了他为贯彻联合国和非洲统一组织关于解决西撒冲突的和平计划的西北部非洲之行。
    埃斯皮埃尔的西北非之行是在摩洛哥国王哈桑二世和西撒人阵高级代表团在马拉喀什会晤后进行的。
    他在抵达时发表讲话说：“西撒问题的最新进展预示着公民投票能够在和平与公正解决的良好条件下进行”，它“为西撒地区持久和平的积极发展开辟了前景”。他强调指出，他此行的主要目的是“对话，观察目前的形势，然后向秘书长汇报”。
    访问期间，埃斯皮埃尔将于十一日在马拉喀什同摩洛哥国王举行会谈。十二日至十四日将在阿尤恩同摩洛哥驻西撒行政长官进行接触和会谈。他还将同西撒人阵负责人进行会谈。随后，他将访问努瓦克肖特和阿尔及尔。
    此行结束后，埃斯皮埃尔将前往巴马科向非洲统一组织执行主席穆萨·特拉奥雷通报此行的成果。
    有消息说，两天前，联合国秘书长佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔在巴黎会见了西撒人阵代表团。代表团向他通报了摩洛哥国王哈桑二世与西撒人阵代表团马拉喀什会晤的情况。此次会晤后，人们对贯彻联合国和非统组织的和平计划的进展情况表示乐观。西撒人阵认为，此次会晤为达成一项“全面和最终的协议开辟了道路”。
