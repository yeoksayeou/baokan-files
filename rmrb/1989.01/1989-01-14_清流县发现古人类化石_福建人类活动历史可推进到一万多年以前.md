	Ancient human fossils have been discovered in Qingliu County, pushing back the history of human activity in Fujian Province to over ten thousand years ago.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Fujian, January 13th - Archaeologists in Fujian Province recently discovered ancient human fossils in Qingliu County. This discovery pushes back the history of human activity in Fujian to over ten thousand years ago.

	In a foxhole located in the dense forest on the northeastern bank of the Jiu Long River at the western end of the Ansha Reservoir in this county, archaeologist Fan Xuechun discovered an ancient human lower molar fossil, which drew the attention of relevant academic institutions and experts. In early December 1988, a team of experts from the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Fujian Provincial Museum conducted a thorough review and detailed investigation of the site and stratigraphic relationship of this ancient human lower molar fossil. They confirmed the accuracy of the fossil site and stratigraphic relationship and also discovered co-existing late Pleistocene animal fossils, including the lower incisor and molar fossils of the hairy hedgehog, bear molar fossils, South China giant tapir molar fossils, wild boar premolar and molar fossils, deer premolar and molar fossils, and rodent incisor fossils.

	After identification by relevant experts from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, it was confirmed that this ancient human lower molar fossil belongs to late Pleistocene Homo sapiens, dating back approximately ten thousand years. It was also confirmed that this is the first time that an ancient human fossil with a specific location and stratigraphic position has been discovered in Fujian Province.
