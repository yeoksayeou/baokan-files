A new type of liquid glucose made from corn using a one-step process has been successfully developed in Haiyang County, Shandong Province, and is now being supplied to the market. Previously, liquid glucose production in China used the "two-step acid method," which involved converting raw materials into starch and then hydrolyzing it with acid. This process was complex, had high production costs, and resulted in a product with a salty taste. The new "one-step dual enzyme method" produces liquid glucose with a sweet taste and has the advantages of requiring less investment, lower energy consumption, simpler process, reduced pollution, and lower production costs.

　　新型液体葡萄糖在海阳获成功
    玉米一步法制液体葡萄糖，在山东省海阳县试制成功，并开始供应市场。过去我国生产液体葡萄糖采用的是“两步酸法”，即将原料制成淀粉，再经酸水解而成，工艺复杂，生产成本高，并且味道偏咸。新的“一步双酶法”制液体葡萄糖味道甘甜，具有投资少，耗能低、工艺简便、减少污染、生产成本低等特点。
