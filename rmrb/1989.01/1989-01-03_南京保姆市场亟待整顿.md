	The Nanjing Nanny Market Urgently Needs Rectification

	Editor:

	Recently, the Xuanwu District Public Security Bureau of Nanjing City, in conjunction with the Municipal Women's Federation and Xinjiekou Street, conducted a joint investigation of the "Xinjiekou Family Service Center" (commonly known as the nanny market) located in Xiangpuying.

	Upon entering the small room of the nanny introduction agency, a long bench was occupied by several rural women. Flipping through the nanny introduction registration book, one can see that those who came to work as nannies included people from five suburban counties of Nanjing City, from Anhui Province's Wuhu, Fanchang, Hanshan, and Nuling counties, and from Henan, Hubei, and Hunan provinces. Among them, the youngest was 14 years old, the oldest was over 50, with most being around 18 years old.

	It is reported that about 100 nannies are successfully introduced and hired through this agency each month. According to the procedures, to become a nanny, one must present their identity card and a certificate from their local grassroots organization to be registered. However, the "free market" outside the introduction agency does not require any certificates or procedures, and the number of transactions there is at least ten times that of the introduction agency each day.

	Due to the chaotic management, some lawbreakers linger here every day, using the pretext of finding workers to take away some young women. Sometimes, fights even break out over a desirable candidate. Some criminals commit rape against the hired workers. On September 6 last year, Tang Bin, a young worker from the Nanjing City Bus Repair Factory (who was executed on December 21 last year), used the pretext of hiring a nanny to lure Shi Jinyue, a young woman from Nuling County, Anhui Province, to Yuhuatai, where he raped and killed her. Some rural girls waiting for jobs often sleep on the streets and are frequently harassed by lawbreakers.

	Nannies are a social necessity, but Nanjing City should implement unified management of nanny introduction agencies, clarify the responsible departments; adjust and strengthen the management personnel, establish strict regulations, and strictly enforce the hiring procedures; those who use the pretext of hiring nannies to commit crimes should be legally punished; for nanny introduction agencies that do not meet the above conditions, relevant departments should rectify or shut them down.

　　南京保姆市场亟待整顿
    编辑同志：
    最近，南京市玄武区公安分局会同市妇联、新街口街道对设在香铺营的“新街口家庭服务处”（俗称保姆市场）进行了联合调查。
    走进保姆介绍所的小屋，一条长凳上坐着几名农村妇女。翻开保姆介绍登记簿，可以看到，前来当保姆的人，有本市５个郊县的，有来自安徽省无为、繁昌、含山、南陵等县的，还有来自河南、湖北、湖南等地的。她们中年龄最小的１４岁，最大的５０多岁，以１８岁左右的为多。
    据介绍，经这里登记介绍成交的雇佣保姆，每月约有１００人。按手续，要当保姆需交验本人的身份证和居住地区基层组织的证明，方可登记。但介绍所门口的“自由市场”，则不需要任何证件和手续，每天成交数至少是介绍所的１０倍。
    由于管理上的混乱，一些不法分子整天滞留于此，以找雇工为名，将一些女青年带走。有时甚至为争一名貌端的待聘者发生斗殴，有些犯罪分子对雇工进行强奸犯罪。去年９月６日，市客车修理厂青工唐斌（已于去年１２月２１日被处决），就是在这里以雇保姆为名，将安徽省南陵县女青年施金霞诱骗至雨花台强奸后杀死。还有的待聘农村姑娘露宿街头，常常受到不法分子的侵害。
    保姆是社会的需要，但南京市应对保姆介绍所实行归口管理，明确其主管部门；调整充实管理人员，建立严密的规章制度，严格雇聘手续；对借雇佣保姆之名进行犯罪活动的人应予依法打击；对不具备上述条件而开设的保姆介绍所，有关部门应予以整顿或取缔。
