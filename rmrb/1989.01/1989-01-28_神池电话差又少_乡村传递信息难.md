Title: Poor and Insufficient Telephone Service in Shenchi

Edition: 5

Currently, only 20% of the villages in our county have telephones installed, and many of these phones are not functional. As a result, most villages in our county rely on bicycles and foot to convey information.

Why is the telephone communication infrastructure in our county's villages so poor? Zhang Jie, the director of the county postal and telecommunications bureau, said: It is due to the lack of attention from relevant departments and the scarcity of funds allocated by the financial department for telephone construction. Sometimes, even when funds are allocated, they are misappropriated by some township governments. Secondly, there is no unified planning and management body for the county's telephone communication system.

It is suggested that relevant departments take immediate measures to establish a telephone communication network in our county's rural areas.

　　神池电话差又少  乡村传递信息难
    目前，我县农村只有２０％的乡村安装了电话，而且许多电话根本打不通。因此现在我县大部分乡村传递信息，只好靠自行车和两条腿。
    我县乡村电话通讯设施为什么如此差？县邮电局局长张杰说：是有关部门不重视，财政部门很少下拨电话建设资金，有时拨一点也被一些乡政府挪用了。二是全县的电话通讯没有统一规划、统一管理的机构。
    建议有关部门尽快采取措施，建立我县农村的电话通讯网。
