The North Sea Fleet Air Force Logistics Department has, since last year, insisted on democratic evaluation of party members. This has enabled over 700 party members to consciously submit to the overall needs of military construction, fully play a model and leading role, and maintain clean and honest governance. The number of criticism letters from the masses has decreased from 28 in 1987 to 2 in 1988.

The logistics department has 13 brigade-level units, with 80% of party member cadres in charge of money and materials. During the period of military downsizing and reorganization, some party members experienced fluctuations in their thoughts, and under the influence of some negative phenomena in society, the department party committee received 28 letters of criticism from both inside and outside the military in 1987. In early 1988, the department party committee decided to establish a system of democratic evaluation of party members and formulated 20 items as the basis for the evaluation.

The establishment of the democratic evaluation system for party members has enabled party members, especially party member cadres, to generally adhere to the principle that their stay or departure should be based on the needs of military construction, and that bribery is ineffective in front of them. Last year, 8 party member cadres refused bribes totaling nearly 10,000 yuan. On March 26, 1988, two salesmen from Huarong County, Henan Province, visited the home of Lai Junzhong, director of the Aviation Materials Department, to promote portable welding machines. Lai told them to come to his office in the afternoon to discuss the matter. However, the two salesmen did not go to the office in the afternoon but instead came to Lai's home again, leaving a letter. Lai opened the letter after returning home from work and found 40 notes of 50 yuan each inside. The next day, Lai brought the 2,000 yuan to the office and returned it in full to the two salesmen in the presence of the office staff. The deal did not go through due to the poor quality of the welding machines.

Last year, after two rounds of democratic evaluation, 145 people were rated as outstanding party members, 402 as qualified party members, and 21 as basically qualified party members. There were no unqualified party members.

　　北海舰队航空兵后勤部民主评议党员    
    １４５人被评为优秀共产党员
    本报讯  人民解放军海军北海舰队航空兵后勤部自去年以来，坚持民主评议党员，使７００多名党员能自觉服从军队建设大局，充分发挥模范带头作用，保持清政廉洁，来自群众的各种批评信件由１９８７年的２８封降到去年的２封。
    这个后勤部有１３个团级单位，８０％的党员干部手中掌管着钱和物。在部队精简整编期间，个别党员思想出现波动，再加上社会上一些不良现象的影响，１９８７年部党委收到军内外群众批评信件２８封，１９８８年初，部党委决定，建立民主评议党员制度，并制定了２０条内容，作为民主评议党员的依据。
    建立民主评议党员制度，使党员，尤其是党员干部基本上能做到：走留要从军队建设这个大局的需要；贿赂行为在他们面前行不通。去年，有８名党员干部拒受贿赂，折合人民币近万元。去年３月２６日中午，河南滑县两名推销员找到航材处赖俊忠处长家推销手提式电焊机，赖处长告诉他们下午到办公室洽谈。可是，两名推销员下午没有到办公室去，而是又一次来到赖处长家留下一封信，赖处长下班回到家里拆开一看，里面装有５０元面额的人民币４０张，第二天赖处长把整整２０００元人民币带到办公室，当着处里人员如数退给两名销售人员。由于电焊机质量差，生意没谈成。
    去年，经过两次民主评议，有１４５人被评为优秀共产党员，４０２人被评为合格党员，２１人被评为基本合格党员，没有一个不合格党员。
