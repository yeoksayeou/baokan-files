Among the Third World countries, China is one of the first to engage in high-tech development, possess high-tech breakthrough capabilities, and has already established a preliminary high-tech industry.

In the early days of the founding of the People's Republic, when the national budget achieved a balance of income and expenditure in 1951 and had a slight surplus, China immediately focused on emerging industries and developed the aviation industry. In 1955, the decision was made to develop nuclear technology and the nuclear industry. In 1956, China formulated its first long-term scientific and technological development plan, the "1956-1967 Science and Technology Development Outline," which identified 57 key tasks and 616 core issues in high-tech fields such as computer technology, semiconductor technology, automation technology, radio technology, nuclear technology, and jet technology. These were the most urgent scientific and technological fields for China, and the policy of "focusing on key areas and catching up" was proposed. Due to the far-sighted decisions made in the 1950s based on the accelerating trend of global scientific and technological development, the strong organizational leadership of the relevant authorities, and the diligent efforts of high-tech researchers, China achieved many significant results in high-tech development, including the construction of atomic reactors and cyclotrons; the discovery of anti-sigma negative hyperons; the successful development of general-purpose electronic computers; the application of artificial unisexual reproduction and the world's first artificial synthesis of crystalline insulin; and the "Two Bombs, One Satellite," among others.

Since the founding of the People's Republic, China has invested over 100 billion yuan in high-tech fields, accounting for approximately 6.3% of the total national construction investment. Currently, China has a high-tech industry workforce of over 3 million people, forming a certain industrial scale. In 1987, the output value of China's high-tech industry was estimated to be over 74 billion yuan, accounting for approximately 6.8% of the gross national product. Additionally, the new value created by the penetration of high technology into various industries is difficult to estimate. It can be affirmed that high technology and its industry have played and will continue to play an important role in China's economic development.

High-tech industry plays a leading and core role in contemporary international economic and trade activities. This industry is composed of enterprises and related departments engaged in or primarily engaged in the research, development, production, operation, and service of high-tech, knowledge-intensive products. The main difference between high-tech industry and other industries is that the research and development expenses and the number of scientists and engineers are generally higher than the average level of general manufacturing industries. The basic characteristics of high-tech industry are high investment in research and development and high added value output, active market development awareness and export competitiveness, and stable maintenance of relatively high labor productivity and economic growth rates. The strong vitality of this industry is manifested in the continuous strengthening of high-tech research and development innovation activities, which produce generation after generation of new products with huge commercial value and market potential produced by high-tech means. These products include electronic information products, new materials products, new energy and high-efficiency energy-saving products, biological and medical engineering products, aerospace and aviation products, marine technology products, laser and nuclear technology products, electromechanical integration and intelligent machinery products, and so on. In today's world, goods with high technology as their core content are the main objects of competition in the international market; high-tech industry is the main competitor in the face of fierce competition. High-tech industry is the main support for a country or region's economic, scientific, technological, military, and political status. Spare no effort to promote and strengthen the high-tech industry in one's own country and region, which is the inevitable path to achieving high-level development.

From the 1950s to the early 1960s, China successfully initiated modern science and technology in aviation, nuclear energy, rockets, electronics, and automation, laying the foundation for the development of high technology and its industry, and achieving some world-renowned results. If it were not for the turmoil that began in the mid-1960s, we could have continued to maintain a strong momentum in the wave of the world's new technological revolution and demonstrated our strength in scientific and technological development in the contemporary international high-tech competition. However, we did miss this rare opportunity, and the process of high-tech industrialization in China was delayed for about 15 to 20 years.

Since the 1980s, under the macro background of reform and opening up, China's high-tech industry and its development have taken three important steps. The first step was in October 1983 when Comrade Zhao Ziyang proposed that attention should be paid to studying the new technological revolution in the world and our countermeasures. Thereafter, China was one of the first countries in the world to formulate a comprehensive strategy to meet the challenges and opportunities of the new technological revolution, including eight specific strategies for various high technologies and the progress of traditional industrial technologies, which established the basic guiding ideology for the new development of China's high-tech industry, and proposed the main policies and strategies. The second step was in March 1986 when Comrade Deng Xiaoping instructed to follow the development of world high technology. Thereafter, China formulated the "Outline of the High-Tech Research and Development Plan," listing about a dozen major projects in seven key fields such as biology, aerospace, information, lasers, automation, energy, and new materials, which have significant impact and benefits in the near and long term, as the targets for China to track and break through the world's high-tech frontiers. The third step was in January 1988 when the central leadership comrades pointed out the need to pay attention to the development of high-tech industries, and are currently investigating some high-tech industries and research and development institutions in China, summarizing experiences, identifying problems, and formulating policy measures. At the same time, the State Science and Technology Commission launched the "Torch Program," which aims to promote the commercialization of China's high-tech and new technology achievements.

In the past five years, from the formulation of strategies for the new technological revolution to the implementation of the outline of the high-tech research and development plan, and then to the promotion of high-tech commercialization and industrialization, a clear strategic and decision-making line can be seen: the strategy determines the basic framework for China's development of high technology and its industry; the outline selects China's research and development targets for tracking the world's high-tech frontiers within a limited scope, and the high-tech industrialization plan and related policy measures will pave the way for the further development of China's high-tech industry. From this, it can be seen that China's ability to respond to the global new technological revolution and make strategic and tactical responses is relatively strong. We should make full use of the existing scientific and technological team and industrial base, take advantage of the good conditions for international economic and technological cooperation formed by opening up to the outside world, and take necessary concentrated investments and effective measures to accelerate the historical process of high-tech industrialization in China, so that China can have a place in the world's high-tech field.

    加速我国高技术产业化的历史进程
    邓寿鹏　于维栋
    在第三世界，我国是率先进行高技术开发，拥有高技术攻关能力，并已初步建立了高技术产业的国家。
    建国初期，在１９５１年财政第一次出现收支平衡，并略有结余的情况下，我国立即注视新兴产业，发展了航空工业。１９５５年又作出了发展核技术和核工业的决定。１９５６年我国制定的第一个长期科技发展规划《１９５６—１９６７年科学技术发展远景规划纲要》，确定了计算机技术、半导体技术、自动化技术、无线电技术、核技术、喷气技术等高技术领域的５７项重点任务和６１６个中心问题，为我国最急需的科技领域，并提出了“重点发展，迎头赶上”的方针。由于５０年代根据世界科技发展加速的趋势所作出的具有远见的决策，主管机构强有力的组织领导，以及高科技攻关人员的勤奋拚搏，我国在高科技发展中取得了包括原子反应堆和回旋加速器的建成；反西格马负超子的发现；通用电子计算机的研制成功；人工单性生殖的运用和世界首次人工合成结晶胰岛素；以及“两弹一星”等等许多重大成就。
    建国以来，我国累计向高技术领域的投资超过１０００亿元，约占国家全部建设投资的６．３％。目前已拥有一支３００多万人的高技术产业队伍，初步形成了一定的产业规模。１９８７年，我国高技术产业的产值估算已达到７４０多亿元，约占国民生产总值的６．８％。此外，由高技术向各个产业渗透所创造的新的增值还难以估算。可以肯定，高技术及其产业已经在我国经济发展中发挥了并将继续发挥重要的作用。
    高技术产业是当代国际经济、贸易活动中，起先导和核心作用的产业。这个产业由从事或主要从事技术、知识密集的高技术产品研究、开发、生产、经营、服务等项活动的企业群及其相关部门组成。高技术产业与其它产业的主要区别在于：研究与开发费用以及拥有的科学家和工程师人数普遍超过一般制造业的平均水平。高技术产业的基本特征是，高额的研究与开发的投入和高额附加价值产出，活跃的市场开拓意识和出口竞争能力，稳定地保持较高的劳动生产率和经济增长率。这个产业的强大生命力表现为，通过日益强化的高技术研究开发的创新活动，推出一代又一代以高技术手段生产的具有巨大商业价值和市场潜力的新兴产品。这些产品包括电子信息产品、新材料产品、新能源及高效节能产品、生物及医学工程产品、航天及航空产品、海洋技术产品、激光及核技术产品、机电一体化及智能机械产品，等等。当今世界，以高技术为核心内涵的商品，是国际市场上的主要角逐对象；高技术产业是面对激烈竞争的主要竞技者。高技术产业是一个国家和地区经济、科技、军事和政治地位的主要后盾。不遗余力地推进和强化本国和本地区的高技术产业，是实现高水平发展的必由之路。
    从５０年代到６０年代初期，我国成功地实现了航空、核能、火箭、电子、自动化等现代科技的启动，为高技术及其产业的发展奠定了基础，取得了一些举世瞩目的成果。如果不是６０年代中期开始的动乱，我们本可以在世界新技术革命的潮流中，继续保持强劲的势头，在当代高技术的国际角逐中显示出我们科技发展的力量。然而，我们毕竟丧失了这个难得的时机，我国高技术及其产业化的进程被耽误了大约１５至２０年之久。
    ８０年代以来，在改革和开放的宏观背景下，我国高技术及其产业的发展重新跨出了重要的三步。第一步是，１９８３年１０月，赵紫阳同志提出应当注意研究世界新的技术革命和我们的对策。此后，我国在世界上较早地制定了迎接新技术革命挑战和机遇的综合对策，包括各项高技术及传统工业技术进步在内的８个专项对策，为我国高技术及其产业的新发展确立了基本指导思想，提出了主要方针和策略。第二步是，１９８６年３月，邓小平同志批示要跟踪世界高技术的发展。此后，我国制定了高技术研究发展计划纲要，把在近期和远期都具有重大影响和效益的生物、航天、信息、激光、自动化、能源、新材料等７个重点领域的十几个重大项目，列为我国瞄准世界高技术前沿的跟踪和攻关目标。第三步是，１９８８年１月，中央领导同志指出要注意高技术产业发展问题，目前正在对我国的一些高技术产业和研究开发机构进行调查，总结经验，发现问题，制定政策措施。同时，国家科委推出了一项旨在推动我国高技术、新技术科技成果商品化的“火炬计划”。
    在过去的５年间，从新技术革命对策的制定，到高技术研究发展计划纲要的实施，再到高技术商品化、产业化的推进，可以看出一条清晰的战略和决策思路：对策从总体上确定了我国发展高技术及其产业的基本框架；纲要在有限范围内选择了我国跟踪世界高技术前沿的研究开发目标，高技术产业化计划及有关的政策措施将为我国高技术产业的进一步发展廓清道路。由此看来，我国在响应全球新技术革命，作出战略和策略反应的能力是较强的。我们应该充分利用现有的科技队伍和工业基础，借助对外开放形成的国际经济技术合作的良好条件，采取必要的集中投入和有力的措施，加速推进我国高技术产业化的历史进程，使我国在世界高科技领域中占有一席之地。
