Thai Foreign Minister's Visit to Hanoi

By Liu Aicheng

Thai Foreign Minister Siddhi Savetsila visited Vietnam from January 9 to 12 for a four-day official visit. This was the first visit by a Thai foreign minister to Hanoi in 12 years. During the visit, Siddhi met with Vietnamese Communist Party General Secretary Nguyen Van Linh and Prime Minister Do Muoi, and held two rounds of talks with Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach on issues related to Cambodia and bilateral relations.

The primary purpose of Thai Foreign Minister Siddhi Savetsila's visit to Hanoi was to seek a swift resolution to the Cambodian issue, thereby easing regional tensions, reducing and ultimately eliminating the adverse impacts and threats posed by Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia on Thailand, and improving Thai-Vietnamese relations.

Three days before the Thai foreign minister's visit to Hanoi, under increasing international pressure and considering its own interests, Vietnam announced a new timeline for its complete withdrawal. Compared to previous announcements, this was a step forward. Therefore, Thailand welcomed this development while hoping that Vietnam would fulfill its promises.

During his talks with the Vietnamese foreign minister, Siddhi expressed that his primary concern was whether Vietnam could guarantee a complete withdrawal from Cambodia by September and hoped for a clear timeline for the withdrawal. However, Nguyen Co Thach stated, "It depends on the progress of the political solution," "The real decision depends on the time when an agreement is reached," "We can reach a political solution by September 1989, but this does not mean that all troops will be withdrawn by September." Regarding the timeline for withdrawal, Nguyen Co Thach believed, "It is not yet time to discuss a specific timeline."

Another important issue discussed by Siddhi and Nguyen Co Thach was the deployment of United Nations peacekeeping forces in Cambodia. The Thai side advocated for the deployment of United Nations peacekeeping forces to supervise Vietnam's withdrawal and other peace processes, helping Hanoi fulfill its promises and ensuring that the withdrawal would truly be part of the political solution to the Cambodian issue. This is because in May 1988, Vietnam had announced that it would begin withdrawing 50,000 troops by the end of the year and move its troops stationed along the Cambodian-Thai border 30 kilometers back. However, due to the lack of international supervision, it was impossible to verify. It is generally believed that Vietnam did not fully fulfill its previous promises. The Thai Armed Forces Headquarters' monthly press conferences almost always released news of Vietnamese artillery shelling Thai territory. Therefore, Thailand attaches great importance to the issue of deploying United Nations peacekeeping forces. Before Siddhi's visit, the Thai side had already sent an advance team to Hanoi to propose the above suggestions. During the talks, due to the Thai side's insistence on this demand, a compromise was finally reached with the Vietnamese side, with Vietnam advocating for the deployment of an "international monitoring organization" instead of "United Nations peacekeeping forces."

The two foreign ministers also discussed the "internal issues of Cambodia." However, according to Nguyen Co Thach, "The differences on the internal issues of Cambodia still exist and have not narrowed." Observers believe this indicates that Vietnam's attitude towards the future government of Cambodia has not changed. High-ranking officials of the Cambodian resistance revealed that since November last year, when the dry season began in Cambodia, the invading Vietnamese forces have intensified their attacks and sweeps on the resistance forces. Their goal is to secure more territory before withdrawal, handing it over to the Khmer Rouge forces to guard and manage as a bargaining chip for future political negotiations. To strengthen the Khmer Rouge forces, Vietnam is currently teaching some Vietnamese military personnel the Khmer language and then integrating them into the pseudo-army.

On January 11, Siddhi and Nguyen Co Thach held a joint press conference. Both sides believed that the talks were "successful" and produced "positive results," but they also acknowledged that there were still some differences.

### 泰国外长的河内之行

　　泰国外长的河内之行
    本报记者  刘爱成
    泰国外交部长西提于本月９日至１２日对越南进行了为期４天的正式访问。这是１２年来第一位泰国外长访问河内。在访问中，西提会见了越南劳动党总书记阮文灵、总理杜梅，同越南外长阮基石就柬埔寨和双边关系问题举行了两轮会谈。
    泰国外长西提·沙卫西拉这次出访河内的主要目的是寻求柬埔寨问题的尽快解决，以便缓和本地区的紧张局势，减少和最终消除越侵柬对泰国造成的不利影响和威胁，改善泰越两国的关系。
    在泰国外长出访河内前３天，越南迫于国际社会越来越大的压力和出于自身利益的考虑，宣布了新的全部撤军时间。同过去相比，这是前进了一步。因此，泰国对此表示欢迎，同时希望越南能履行自己的诺言。
    在与越南外长会谈中，西提外长表示，他首先要知道的是越南能否保证在９月以前全部从柬撤军，同时希望有一个明确的撤军时间表。但阮基石说，“要看政治解决的情况如何”，“真正的决定要看达成协议的时间”，“我们可以在１９８９年９月间达成政治解决协议，但这并不意味着所有军队将在９月间全部撤完。”在撤军时间表问题上，阮基石认为“现在还不是讨论具体时间表的时候”。
    西提外长与阮基石讨论的另一个重要问题是派联合国维持和平部队进驻柬埔寨的问题。泰国方面主张派联合国维持和平部队以监督越南撤军及其他和平进程，帮助河内履行自己的诺言，使其撤军能真正“成为政治解决柬埔寨问题的一部分”。因为去年５月２６日越南也曾宣布从去年６月开始到年底从柬撤军５万，并将其沿柬泰边境驻扎的部队后撤３０公里。但由于没有国际监督，无法证实。人们普遍认为越南并没有完全履行上次的诺言。泰国武装部队最高司令部每月举行的记者招待会几乎都要发布越军炮击泰国领土的消息，因此，泰国极为重视派联合国维持和平部队问题。在西提出访前，泰方就已派了一个先遣组向河内提出了上述建议。在会谈中由于泰方一再坚持这一要求，最后与越方达成妥协，越南主张派“国际监督机构”，代替“联合国维持和平部队”。
    两国外长在会谈中还谈及了“柬埔寨内部问题”。但据阮基石说，双方在“柬埔寨内部问题上的分歧依然存在，没有缩小”。观察家们认为，这表明越南对未来柬埔寨政府的态度没有改变。柬埔寨抵抗组织高级人士透露，自去年１１月柬进入旱季以来，侵柬越军加强了对抵抗力量部队的进攻和扫荡，其目的是要在撤走以前打下更多的地盘，交给韩桑林部队守卫管辖，作为今后政治谈判的筹码。为了加强韩桑林政权部队实力，越南正让部分越军官兵学习柬语，然后把他们编入伪军。
    西提和阮基石１１日举行联合记者招待会，双方认为会谈是“成功的”，产生了“积极的成果”，但同时他们也承认还存在某些分歧。
