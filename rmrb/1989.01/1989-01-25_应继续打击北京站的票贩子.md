On the evening of November 22, 1988, I took the No. 15 train from Beijing Railway Station to Guangzhou. An elderly gentleman sitting next to me told me that he had come to Guangzhou to visit his son. He had been queuing for three days at Beijing Railway Station to buy a ticket but failed. On the fourth day, he bought a hard seat ticket for 85 yuan from a young man. In fact, the price of a hard seat ticket from Beijing to Guangzhou is only 38.70 yuan.

On December 5, I took the No. 59 train and met a soldier. To ensure he could return to his unit on time, he bought a Beijing Railway Station platform ticket for 3 yuan, which is actually worth 5 fen. He then boarded the train and bought a ticket later. At that time, the person selling the tickets was holding a stack of platform tickets and hawking them near the platform ticket counter at Beijing Railway Station. I don't know how this person got so many platform tickets?

In recent years, the public security department at Beijing Railway Station has made some progress in cracking down on ticket scalpers, and the general public has applauded. Recently, however, the problem of scalping train and platform tickets has become increasingly rampant. I suggest that relevant departments take measures to continue cracking down on ticket scalpers.

### 应继续打击北京站的票贩子

　　应继续打击北京站的票贩子
    １９８８年１１月２２日晚，我在北京火车站乘１５次列车到广州，同座的一位老大爷告诉我：他去广州看望儿子，在北京火车站排了３天队也买不上票，第４天上午花８５元从一年轻人手里买了一张硬座票。实际上，北京至广州的硬座票只要３８．７０元。
    １２月５日，我乘５９次列车时遇见一战士，他为了能及时赶回部队，花了３元钱买了一张价值５分钱的北京火车站站台票，然后上车补票。当时卖票人手里拿着一沓站台票，在北京火车站站台票售票处旁叫卖。不知这个人是怎样搞到那么多站台票的？
    近几年来，北京火车站公安部门打击票贩子收到一定效果，广大群众拍手称快。最近，倒卖车票、站台票的票贩子日渐猖獗，建议有关部门采取措施，继续打击票贩子。
