In 1980, an Italian passenger was hit on the head by a falling ladder while on a train, resulting in a bump. The passenger sued the state-owned railway bureau in a local court. Although the injury was not severe, the passenger insisted on resolving the issue through legal means.

The lawsuit was filed in 1980, but the case was not heard until 1983. Four years later, the court ruled that the evidence in the lawsuit was insufficient and decided not to accept it. Three months ago, the plaintiff appealed again, and the judge said this case had been scheduled for discussion, with a decision expected in 1992.

A small case like this has dragged on for nearly 10 years and is still not resolved. According to the *New York Times*, this is a common phenomenon in Italian courts, mainly due to a severe shortage of court staff, inadequate equipment, and cumbersome and chaotic court procedures. A typical example is the 1969 explosion at two banks in Milan, where 17 people died and four suspects were arrested and imprisoned. Seventeen years later, the appeals court ruled them not guilty and released them.

The Italian government has been criticized by the public multiple times for the low efficiency of court work. Court staff also have their own difficulties. Over the past 15 years, criminal cases in Italy have increased by 4-5% annually, but the number of staff has not increased, especially in areas where mafia activities are rampant, making the situation even more difficult. Currently, Italians are hoping that a new criminal law will be passed next year to improve the work of the courts.

　　案子虽小　十年未了
    １９８０年，意大利一乘客坐火车时被掉下来的梯子在头上打起了一个包。为此，乘客向当地法院起诉，告了国营铁路局一状。他伤势并不重，但坚持要通过法律手段来解决问题。
    起诉书是１９８０年提交给法院的，到１９８３年才审理这个案子。又过了４年，法院认为起诉书证据不足，宣布不予受理。３个月前，原告不服，再次上诉，法官说这桩案子已安排上了议事日程，到１９９２年才能裁决。
    这样一桩小案子前后拖了将近１０年，至今还未了结。据《纽约时报》报道，这在意大利法院是十分普遍的现象，主要因为法院工作人员严重短缺、设备不齐全，再加上法院手续烦琐、杂乱。最为典型的一个例子是１９６９年米兰两家银行发生了一起爆炸事件，１７人丧生，４名嫌疑犯因此被捕投入牢房，１７年后，上诉法院宣判他们无罪释放。
    意大利政府多次因法院工作效率低受到公众的抨击。法院工作人员也有自己的苦衷。近１５年来，意大利刑事案件每年递增４％—５％，但工作人员却没有增加，特别是黑手党活动猖獗的地区，事情更难办。目前，意大利人正盼着明年通过一项新的刑事法令来改进法院的工作。
