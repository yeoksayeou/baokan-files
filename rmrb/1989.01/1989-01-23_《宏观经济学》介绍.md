	Introduction to Macroeconomics
		By Dai Yu Chen

	The Rational Expectations School is a notable new school in the field of macroeconomics. The Rational Expectations Hypothesis has deepened macroeconomic theory, closely linking economic regulation with rational expectations, and shifting economic intervention from passive to active. This approach enhances the scientific, rational, and practical nature of macroeconomic policies and is beneficial for examining future economic development.

	In China's economic work, the phrase "上有政策、下有对策" (top-level policies, bottom-level countermeasures) is prevalent. This implies that when policies are set at the top, they must be implemented at the grassroots level, and no alternative policies should be adopted based on personal interests. This mindset is common among those who have long lived under a command economy. However, the Rational Expectations approach is the opposite. It views "上有政策、下有对策" as a natural occurrence, suggesting that when formulating policies, one should consider the possible countermeasures people might take. Only then can policies achieve their intended goals. Therefore, they study the strategies that might be adopted based on rational expectations.

	The fundamental proposition of the Rational Expectations School is that consumers and enterprises utilize a great deal of information. They are not only the objects of macroeconomic policy adjustments but also active participants in policy-making and implementation. Their responses to macroeconomic policies determine the effectiveness of these policies. Economic activities are multifaceted, and the success of macroeconomic policies depends not only on the policy-makers but also on the behavior of market participants, including consumers and enterprises. The behavior of consumers and enterprises is something that policy-makers must fully understand and consider when formulating policies. Past economic theories assumed that economic activities occur within a stable, fixed price system. However, the Rational Expectations School believes that fixed prices are reasonable in the short term but not in the long term. In an inflationary environment, most commodity prices are constantly rising. They explore how the price system is linked to the trend of stable price increases. I believe that the specific theoretical analyses of the Rational Expectations School are secondary; their approach to addressing problems may be more instructive for Chinese theorists.

	The Rational Expectations School has become an important school of thought in Western macroeconomic theory. So far, there have been no translations or introductions of Rational Expectations School works in China. Now, several scholars, including Feng Li Xin, Li Ying, Bao Xiao Lin, and Yu Ji An, have translated "Macroeconomics" by Robert Hall and John Taylor of Stanford University, filling this gap. Compared to other Western macroeconomics books published in China, this book has the following features:

	First, the content is new. It summarizes the new developments and breakthroughs in Western macroeconomics over the past twenty years, such as the Rational Expectations Theory, price adjustment theory, and capital leasing price theory, the time lag of macroeconomic policies, full employment, fiscal deficits, wage and price rigidity theories, macroeconomic policies and target evaluations, macroeconomic policies in the world economy, interest rate and exchange rate theories, and so on.

	Second, the structure is new. Starting from basic concepts, it gradually introduces theories, discussing the errors in the economic theories of Keynes and others, and explaining new theories. The discussions are theory-linked to practice, using actual data for analysis and verification, with detailed examples.

	Third, the sequence of arguments is new. It moves from closed economies to open economies, from short-term economic changes to long-term economic changes, and from domestic macroeconomic policies to international macroeconomic policies.

	Fourth, the materials are new. The book uses economic data and examples from the United States and several other Western countries over the past 30 years to argue the successes and failures of macroeconomic policies. Therefore, to a certain extent, this book can be considered a reference guide for macroeconomic policy-makers.

　　《宏观经济学》介绍
    戴园晨
    理性预期学派，是宏观经济学派中引人瞩目的新学派之一。理性预期假说把宏观经济理论引向深入，使经济调节与理性预期紧密地结合起来，使经济干预从被动转向主动，它有利于提高宏观经济政策的科学性、合理性、适用性，并有利于考察经济的未来的发展。
    在我国的经济工作中，流行着“上有政策、下有对策”的说法。它意味着上面定了政策，下面必须贯彻执行，不应当从自己的利益出发采取什么别的政策。这是长期生活在命令经济中的人们的想法。而理性预期的思想方法则与此相反，它把“上有政策、下有对策”，看成理所当然的事情，指出在制定政策时就应当考虑人们可能采取的对策，这样才能够使政策达到预期的目标，因而他们把基于理性预期所可能采取的对策作为研究的对象。
    理性预期学派的基本命题是：消费者和企业使许多信息对其有用。他们不仅是宏观经济政策调节的对象，而且是积极的自身政策的制定者和国家政策的执行者，他们对宏观政策的反应决定着政策的效果。经济活动是多方面，宏观经济政策的成功与否，不仅决定于政策制定者一方，还在于作为市场主体的消费者以及企业的行为。消费者和企业的行为是宏观政策制定者必须充分了解并且在政策制定时加以考虑的。过去的经济理论假定在稳定的固定价格体系中进行经济活动，而理性预期学派则认为固定价格在短期内是合理的，而在长期内是不合理的；在通货膨胀环境下，大多数商品价格在不断提高，探讨了价格体系如何与价格稳定上升的趋势相联系。我认为，理性预期学派的具体理论分析倒在其次，他们这种面对问题的思想方法，也许对中国的理论工作者更具有借鉴意义。
    理性预期学派已成为西方宏观经济理论的重要流派，我国迄今尚没有对理性预期学派著作的翻译与介绍。现在，冯立新、李颖、包晓林、余季安等几位同志翻译了美国斯坦福大学教授罗伯特·霍尔和约翰·泰勒合著的《宏观经济学》填补了这一空白。本书与在国内出版的西方宏观经济学相比，有以下几个特点：
    第一、内容新。总括了二十多年来西方宏观经济学的新发展、新突破。如前已提及的理性预期理论，价格调整理论以及资本租赁价格理论，宏观政策的时滞，充分就业、财政赤字，工资、价格刚性理论，宏观经济政策以及目标的评价，世界经济的宏观政策，利率、汇率理论，等等。
    第二、体例新。从基本概念入手，逐步引出理论，对凯恩斯等的经济理论的失误一一加以论说，并阐明新的理论。在论述中理论联系实际，用实际数据进行论述和检验，举例详实。
    第三、论述顺序新。从封闭经济讲到开放经济，从短期经济发展变化讲到长期经济变化，从国内宏观经济政策讲到国际宏观经济政策。
    第四、材料新。从本书的材料数据看，运用了近３０年的美国和其他几个西方国家的实际经济数据及例证，论证了宏观经济政策的得与失，因而本书在一定程度上可以称之为一本宏观政策制定者的参考指南。
