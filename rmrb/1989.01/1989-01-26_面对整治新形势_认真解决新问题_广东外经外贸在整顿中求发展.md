Recently, Guangdong Province has been rectifying its economy and has proposed a series of new measures to promote the development of its outward-oriented economy in response to new problems in its foreign economic and trade work.

While Guangdong Province achieved good results in its foreign economic and trade work last year, it also faced some new problems. The most prominent issues were the overheated construction of export processing zones, the overly large scale of new projects utilizing foreign capital, and the lagging absorption and digestion of foreign technology and capital.

The provincial government has proposed the overall goal of "adjusting the structure, improving the level, promoting outward orientation, and seeking efficiency" in response to the problems that have arisen during the province's progress. The government has also placed the focus of utilizing foreign capital in five areas to accelerate the development of the outward-oriented economy, which involves both importing raw materials and exporting finished products.

First, efforts should be made to ensure the smooth operation of existing foreign-invested enterprises. Currently, the province has over 3,000 foreign-invested enterprises in operation and more than 6,000 registered. These enterprises have significant potential, and under the current economic adjustment, conditions should be created to ensure their normal production.

Second, foreign capital should be selectively used to renovate old enterprises, introducing foreign funds, advanced technology, and management experience to improve the production and operational levels of old enterprises.

Third, the development of wholly foreign-owned enterprises should be encouraged. Last year, the number of newly approved foreign-invested enterprises and the actual utilization of foreign capital in the province increased by more than three times and five times, respectively, compared to 1987. This year, conditions should continue to be created to encourage their development.

Fourth, protective policies should be implemented for projects that have already signed contracts with foreign businesses. Projects that meet the criteria for foreign investment, have good returns, and can generate foreign exchange should be actively promoted.

Fifth, foreign capital should be actively introduced to support industries with strong competitiveness, such as light industry and machinery. For enterprises that are constrained by a lack of raw materials and cannot fully utilize their existing production capacity, the policy of "importing to export" and "large imports and large exports" should be used. This involves importing raw materials and components to produce export products.

　　面对整治新形势　认真解决新问题    
    广东外经外贸在整顿中求发展
    本报讯  记者梁兆明报道：最近，广东省在整治经济过程中，针对经贸工作中的新问题，提出一系列促进外向型经济发展的新措施。
    广东省在去年经贸工作取得好成绩的同时，也存在一些新问题，比较突出的是出口“加工区”的建设过热，利用外资新上项目规模偏大，吸收消化工作跟不上。
    省政府针对在前进中出现的问题，提出“调结构、上水平、促外向、求效益”的总要求，并把利用外资的工作重点放在５个方面，以加快“两头在外”的外向型经济的发展。
    一、切实把现有的外商投资企业办好。目前全省已投产的外商投资企业有３０００多家，注册登记的６０００多家。这批外资企业潜力很大，在当前调整经济的情况下，仍要创造条件保证其正常生产。
    二、利用外资有选择地改造老企业，在老企业上“嫁接”国外资金、先进技术和管理经验，提高老企业的生产经营水平。
    三、鼓励外资兴办独资企业。去年全省新批准的外资企业合同和实际利用外资，比１９８７年分别增长３倍多和５倍多，今年要继续创造条件鼓励其发展。
    四、对已经同外商签约的项目，实施保护政策。凡符合外资投向、效益好、能创汇的项目，都积极上马。
    五、积极引进国外资金，重点扶持竞争力较强的轻工、机电等行业。对于那些因原材料不足，现有生产能力无法充分发挥的企业，运用“以进养出”、“大进大出”的政策，进口原材料、零配件，转产出口产品。
