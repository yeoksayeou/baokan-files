Civil aviation capacity significantly increased last year
    172 people killed in flight accidents; safety issues cannot be ignored

    BEIJING, Jan. 20 (Xinhua) — At today's national civil aviation work conference, it was learned that in 1988, China's aviation transport saw new developments. The entire industry completed a total transport turnover of 2.3 billion ton-kilometers, and transported 14.33 million passengers, both of which showed significant growth compared to the previous year.

    CAAC (Civil Aviation Administration of China) Director Hu Yizhou revealed that last year, through leasing, purchasing, and other means, civil aviation added 13 new transport aircraft, retired 8 old aircraft, resulting in a net increase of 766 seats and 95.7 tons of capacity. Additionally, 10 new domestic routes and 1 international route were opened. As a result, civil aviation now has 288 domestic routes and 37 international routes.

    When discussing the problems in civil aviation work, Hu Yizhou said that the safety situation is particularly severe. Last year, CAAC-affiliated enterprises experienced 4 major flight accidents, resulting in the scrapping of 4 aircraft and the deaths of 126 people. Local aviation companies experienced 1 major flight accident, resulting in the scrapping of 1 aircraft and the deaths of 46 people. There was also 1 hijacking incident. Additionally, there are many problems in service work, flight punctuality, and operational management.

    The main tasks for civil aviation work in 1989 are to ensure safety, improve services, deepen reforms, and increase efficiency.
