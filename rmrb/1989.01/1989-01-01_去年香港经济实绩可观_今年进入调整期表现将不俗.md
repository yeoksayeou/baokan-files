Hong Kong's economic performance was impressive last year, with development gradually slowing down. This year, it will enter an adjustment period but is expected to perform well.

Hong Kong's economy has grown rapidly in recent years, with a growth rate of 13% in the previous year. In 1988, the momentum slowed, with a growth rate of around 7%. Some areas showed significant progress, with re-export trade surpassing the export of locally produced goods for the first time. This marks a major change in Hong Kong's export trade structure. With the increasing economic exchanges, tourism, and family visits between Taiwan and mainland China, various industries in Hong Kong, such as tourism, industry, commerce, finance, and foreign trade, have been significantly boosted. To reduce pressure from American protectionism, Hong Kong actively explored new markets last year, seeking more trading partners. This is a new trend. In the first three quarters of last year, products exported to the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries increased by 19% compared to the same period the previous year. The Soviet Union has become Hong Kong's 38th largest trading partner, and Poland has become the largest importer of Hong Kong goods among Eastern European countries.

Hong Kong is about to enter a new year, facing several challenges. Export growth has slowed, inflation has intensified, and some industries are experiencing labor shortages and rising costs.

Hong Kong's economic ups and downs are closely related to the overall trend of the global economy. If the Western economy slows down this year, it would not be surprising if Hong Kong experiences a "low-speed growth" scenario. However, Hong Kong is unique, with its special status and advantageous conditions, which can be used to alleviate difficulties and achieve ambitions. As a free port, overseas businesses and factories are eager to invest. Located in the increasingly prosperous Asia-Pacific region, its prospects will only get better. Especially in its role in the economic exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, Hong Kong plays an extremely important and irreplaceable role. In establishing the economic cooperation relationship of "Mainland-China—Hong Kong—Taiwan," Hong Kong will benefit the most. Taiwan's trade and economic departments have recognized this "largest intermediary station." Recently, they plan to upgrade the "Investment Service Office" in Hong Kong to a "Representative Office," showing their importance and reliance on Hong Kong. This can be seen as a side evidence. Neighboring countries like Japan continue to increase their investments in Hong Kong, further proving that Hong Kong remains a highly attractive "magnet."

According to some influential analysis institutions, Hong Kong's economic growth rate this year may reach 6%. The economy of mainland China and Hong Kong will have a greater expansion, and re-export trade will continue to be a "rising star," expected to drive Hong Kong's overall economy to continue progressing steadily.

### 去年香港经济实绩可观  今年进入调整期表现将不俗

　　去年香港经济实绩可观
    今年进入调整期表现将不俗
    本报香港电  记者黄际昌报道：去年香港经济实绩可观，发展步伐逐渐放缓，今年进入调整期，仍将表现不俗。
    香港以往几年经济增长相当之快，前年的增长率达１３％。１９８８年势头减弱，增长率亦在７％左右，有些方面进展显著，转口贸易首次超过港产品出口，这是香港出口贸易结构的重大变化。随着台湾与内地的经济交往、旅游探亲日渐频密，对香港的旅游、工业、商业、金融、外贸诸业均有明显的推动。为了减少美国保护主义的压力，香港去年积极开拓新的市场，寻求更多的贸易伙伴。这是一个新迹象。去年头三个季度输往苏联及东欧国家的产品，较前年同期增长１９％，苏联已升为香港的第３８位贸易伙伴，波兰已成为吸纳港货最多的东欧国家。
    香港即将进入新的一年，面对不少困难。产品出口减缓，通货膨胀加剧，部分行业劳工短缺而成本增高。
    香港经济之起落，与世界经济总的态势相关。西方经济今年将放缓，香港如出现“低速渐长”的局面亦不足为奇。但香港毕竟是香港，有其独特的地位和优越的条件，可以用来纾解困难，施展抱负。作为一个自由港，海外客商厂家乐于问津。地处经济愈来愈兴旺的亚太地区的一个要冲，其前景必将更好。特别是它在台湾海峡两岸的交往中扮演一个极为重要的、非他地所能代替的角色，在建立“大陆—香港—台湾”的经济合作关系中，香港亦首受其惠。台湾经贸部门看中了这个“最大中介站”，最近拟将设在香港的“投资服务处”升格为“办事处”，重视和依托香港，可算是个旁证。而邻近一些国家如日本，对香港的投资有增无已，更说明香港仍是一个富有引力的“磁场”。
    据一些有影响的分析机构预计，香港今年的经济的实质增长率可能达到６％，内地与香港经济将有一个更大的扩展，转口贸易仍是“一颗冉冉升起的明星”，可望带动香港整个经济持续稳步前进。
