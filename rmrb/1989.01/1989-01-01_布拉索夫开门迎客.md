More than 600 foreign tourists, drawn by its reputation, became the first guests to be received by the "Cable Car" hotel in Brasov, Romania, during the winter season.

Ten days ago, Brasov, hidden in the icy world of the Carpathian Mountains, opened the curtain on its traditional winter tourism. During the day, various makes of cars, each carrying a pair of skis, moved slowly along; at night, the Christmas trees lit up with colorful lights, creating a festive atmosphere.

On this day, we drove to the "Cable Car" hotel, arriving just as the lights were coming on.

Treading on the snow, we climbed the steps. Above us were the white-capped mountains, and the wide ski slopes seemed to hang in the air; below us was an endless sea of forests, with the snow-laden pine trees rustling in the wind. Leaning on the railing and looking around, it truly felt like riding a cable car, away from the dusty world.

The chief designer of Brasov City, who accompanied us, pointed out the locations of the "Black Goat" hotel, the "Little Lamb" hotel, the "Green Forest Bandit" hotel, the "Sports" hotel, the "Dacian Hut," and the comprehensive entertainment center, from the dimly lit areas. From the architectural style to the entertainment content, each had a unique style. This was only part of the tourist facilities in the "Forest Clearing." This "clearing" that is never empty is dozens of kilometers away from the city, surrounded by a 7,000-hectare sea of pine trees, making it an ideal tourist destination in both winter and summer.

The "Cable Car" hotel in the "Forest Clearing" is not the most famous, with 320 beds, accounting for 10% of the total beds in the "clearing," and an average annual occupancy rate of over 80%. The elegant hotel manager accompanied us as we looked around and talked. In a corner under the stairs, there was a popular café, where a few male and female college students were gathered; upstairs, a large room was set up with a national-style lounge, already booked until New Year's; around the corner, there was a disco hall with music blaring, with an entrance fee of only 11 lei (about one yuan), and a group of graceful dancers were practicing a lively modern dance, which would be performed for the first batch of foreign tourists that evening.

Winter tourism runs from December 22 of the current year to March 15 of the following year. During this period, which includes Christmas, New Year's, and the winter vacation for students, many people are willing to come to the great forest to enjoy the winter scenery. According to the manager of the "Cable Car" hotel, the food and accommodation for a foreign tourist for two weeks cost only 500 dollars. In tourism, they do not practice over-exploitation. Of course, different tourists have different needs, and many are willing to spend money on entertainment, tasting local flavors, and buying souvenirs. The comprehensive entertainment center alone offers 55 entertainment projects, with an entrance fee of 5 lei, and for 10 lei, you can play 10 minutes of bowling. Each hotel has a foreign exchange shop, selling mostly Romanian specialties.

The hotels, villas, and high-end hotels in the "Forest Clearing" and throughout the city are all managed by the Carpathian Mountains Travel Agency. The general manager of the travel agency, Dumitru Burtuya, personally welcomed Chinese friends at the hotel where we stayed. He raised a glass of plum wine with pepper floating on top, calling it Romania's "Maotai." He said he had a real bottle of Maotai, which he had kept for many years, and planned to open it next year to celebrate his 50th birthday. According to the deputy head of the Party Life Department of the *Scînteia* newspaper, Constantin Biliescu, this manager came to Brasov at the age of 16, worked as a chef, studied cooking in France, and then studied economics, serving as a deputy manager. Six years ago, he became the general manager. Due to his capable management, the travel agency he leads has been ranked first in the country for four consecutive years, earning the title of Hero of Socialist Labor, and has maintained this title since 1982.

In the city hall of Brasov, the secretary (also the mayor) told us that this city of 360,000 people receives 460,000 tourists each year, of which 160,000 are from abroad. Currently, their concern is not the lack of tourists, but the insufficient tourist facilities and reception capacity, so they are actively constructing new ones.

"The protection and utilization of the natural wealth given to us by nature is our responsibility," the people of Brasov do not think that everything is perfect. They also face problems that need to be solved, such as electricity and heating, which are not yet satisfactory. Of course, there is much to be proud of in Brasov, not just the tourist resources. Half of the city's residents are workers. More than 50 years ago, Romania's first airplane was manufactured here. Now, the truck factory and tractor factory each have more than 20,000 workers, both of which are the largest in the country. The textile mill, knitting factory, and shoe factory are becoming increasingly modernized, with 90% of their products exported, some even to the United States. The city has business dealings with enterprises from more than 100 countries around the world. In addition, the average living space per person is over 20 square meters, which is also enviable.

Brasov is indeed a place worth visiting.

　　布拉索夫开门迎客
    本报记者  李仁臣
    ６００多位慕名而来的外国旅游者，成为罗马尼亚布拉索夫“缆车”饭店冬季接待的第一批客人。
    十天前，藏在喀尔巴阡山冰雪世界里的布拉索夫，拉开了传统的冬季旅游的帷幕。白昼，不同牌号的小汽车“顶”着一副副滑雪板缓缓而行；入夜，彩灯闪烁的圣诞树渲染着节日的气氛。
    这一天，我们驱车来到“缆车”饭店，已是华灯初上时分。
    踩着积雪，拾级而上，高处是白盔白甲的山峰，宽大的滑雪道如练悬空；脚下是无边无垠的林海，连绵的带雪枝松涛不唱。凭栏环顾，真有乘缆车、隔尘世之感。
    陪同我们的布拉索夫市总设计师，指点灯火阑珊处，一一道出哪是“黑山羊”饭店，哪是“小羊羔”饭店，哪是“绿林好汉”饭店，哪是“体育”饭店，哪是“达契亚人茅屋”，哪是综合娱乐中心……从建筑形式到游乐内容，风格迥异。而这仅是“林中空地”一部分旅游设施。这片不空的“空地”，离城数十公里之远，周围是一片７０００公顷的雪松之海，无论冬夏，都是旅游佳境。
    “缆车”在“林中空地”的饭店中，算不上最负盛名，共有３２０张床位，占整个“空地”床位的１０％，年平均利用率在８０％以上。风度优雅的饭店经理陪我们边看边谈。楼梯下的一角，开设大众化的咖啡座，几位男女大学生正在此相聚；楼上的一个大房间，辟有民族风格的雅座，早已定座至新年；拐弯的通道，连着音乐震响的迪斯科舞厅，入门券仅１１列伊（合人民币一元多），一组窈窕舞女正在排练热情奔放的现代舞蹈，当晚将为冬季首批外国游客献演。
    冬季旅游从当年１２月２２日到来年的３月１５日，这段时间适逢圣诞节、元旦，又含学生的寒假，不少人都愿意到大森林里来领略冬日的情趣。据“缆车”饭店经理介绍，一个外国游客，两周的食宿费用不过５００美元。在旅游上，他们不搞竭泽而渔。当然，不同的游客有不同的需要，愿意在娱乐、品尝风味、买纪念品上掏腰包的，大有人在。仅综合娱乐中心就提供５５种游乐项目，入门收５个列伊，花上１０个列伊就可以玩１０分钟地滚球。每个饭店均设有外汇商店，销售的商品大都是罗马尼亚的特产。
    “林中空地”的饭店、别墅和全市的高级宾馆，均属喀尔巴阡山旅行社。旅行社总经理杜米特鲁·布尔特亚，亲自在我们下榻的饭店祝酒欢迎中国朋友。他举起漂着胡椒的李子酒，称这种酒为罗马尼亚“茅台”。他说，他有一瓶真正的茅台，已藏多年，准备来年开瓶宴客，以庆５０岁生日。据《火花报》党的生活部副主任康斯坦丁·比利耶斯库介绍，这位总经理１６岁来到布拉索夫，当过厨师，曾在法国学烹调，又攻读经济学，任过管理副经理，６年前当上总经理。由于他领导的这家旅行社经营有方，连续４年获全国第一，荣获社会主义劳动英雄称号，并将这个称号从１９８２年保持至今。
    在布拉索夫市府大楼里，市委书记（兼市长）告诉我们，这个３６万人口的城市，每年接待４６万游客，其中１６万来自国外。目前，他们愁的不是客源，而是旅游设施不足，接待能力不够，所以，正在为此而兴土木。
    “保护、利用好大自然给我们的财富，是我们的责任。”布拉索夫人并不认为自己的一切都好，他们也面临着自己需要解决的问题。譬如，供电、供暖尚未尽如人意。当然，值得布拉索夫人骄傲的，也决不只是旅游资源一项。全市居民一半是工人。５０多年前，罗马尼亚第一架飞机就是在这里制造的。现在的卡车厂、拖拉机厂，都有两万多工人，均为全国首屈一指的大厂。织布厂、针织品厂、皮鞋厂日益现代化，９０％的产品出口，有的远销美国。全市与世界１００多个国家的企业有来往。除此之外，人均二十几平方米的住房，也令人羡慕。
    布拉索夫，确实是一个值得一看的地方。
