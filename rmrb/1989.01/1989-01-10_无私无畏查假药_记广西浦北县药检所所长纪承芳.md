One afternoon not long ago, at around 4:00 PM, a resident from Zhaiwei Town brought several packets of drugs to the Pu Bei County Drug Inspection Institute in Guangxi, reporting that there were illegal drug peddlers selling fake drugs in the area. Upon hearing this, Director Ji Chengfang of the Drug Inspection Institute immediately took the drug inspection personnel to investigate. After verifying that the drugs were indeed fake, Ji Chengfang and relevant officials promptly dealt with the fake drug peddler on the spot.

Ji Chengfang is fearless in dealing with those who sell fake drugs, regardless of who they are or which unit they belong to.

The county hospital's joint preparation room sold "Zhen Tong Ling," falsely labeled as a product of Pu Bei Pharmaceutical Factory, to "Huang Xisheng Pharmacy" in Xiao Jiang Town, severely violating the "Drug Administration Law." Ji Chengfang reported to the relevant departments and decided to impose a fine. At that time, someone advised him, "Nowadays, people pay attention to relationships. Your child also works in the preparation room, and if you damage your relationship with the leaders of the preparation room, it will be detrimental to your child. You should show some leniency." However, Ji Chengfang paid no heed to such advice and still fined the unit and the responsible person according to the regulations. Everyone praised him as a loyal guardian of the people's health who does not show favoritism.

In handling various illegal cases, Ji Chengfang dares to eliminate all interference. In April of last year, the North Tong Township Medical and Drug Station knowingly purchased 1,000 fake Terramycin tablets from illegal drug peddlers to sell for profit. After the drug inspection department discovered this, the relevant personnel of the station not only failed to truthfully report the problem but also falsified documents and issued fake receipts. They even sought help from certain county leaders to plead their case. Ji Chengfang insisted on principles and imposed penalties according to the relevant regulations of the "Drug Administration Law."

Ji Chengfang's deeds of upholding principles, enforcing the law impartially, and not showing favoritism have spread far and wide, becoming a celebrated tale among the various ethnic groups in Pu Bei County. To improve drug inspection work, over the past two years, Ji Chengfang, despite being nearly sixty, often climbed mountains and crossed rivers, leading the entire institute to visit over 200 medical units and pharmacies across the county. He promoted and implemented the "Drug Administration Law," actively inspected and confiscated various fake and substandard drugs, and assisted relevant departments in shutting down various illegal drug peddlers.

According to statistics, over the past two years, they have inspected and confiscated 89 types of fake and substandard drugs, totaling over 3,900 pounds. Ji Chengfang inspects over 100 types of drugs each year without any errors. The drug inspection institute he leads has been rated as a "National Advanced County-Level Drug Inspection Institute," and Ji Chengfang has been consecutively rated as an advanced worker in health and civilization at the county, municipal, and autonomous region levels for several years.

　　无私无畏查假药
    ——记广西浦北县药检所所长纪承芳
    新华社记者  刘星泽  新华社通讯员  廖奎
    不久前一天下午４点多钟，寨圩镇一个群众拿了几包药来广西浦北县药检所反映当地有不法药贩销售假药。听到这个情况，药检所所长纪承芳立即带着药检人员前往查处。经核实卖的确是假药后，纪承芳便和有关同志当场对假药贩子进行了严肃处理。
    纪承芳对卖假药的，不管他是什么人什么单位，都敢于抓、敢于管。
    县医院联合制剂室将冒充浦北制药厂生产的“镇痛灵”卖给小江镇个体户“黄喜生药店”出售，严重违反了《药品管理法》。纪承芳请示有关部门决定给予罚款处理。当时有人劝他说：“现在人们都注意讲关系，你的孩子也在制剂室工作，你和制剂室的领导把关系搞坏了，这对你孩子不利，你应该留点情面才好。”纪承芳却不管那一套，他仍然按照规定罚了这个单位和负责人的款。人们都称赞他是为人民健康不徇私情的忠诚卫士。
    纪承芳在处理各种违法案件中，敢于排除一切干扰。去年４月间，北通乡医药站明知故犯，向不法药贩购买假土霉素１０００片出售赚钱。被药检部门发现后，这个站有关人员不但不如实交待问题，反而弄虚作假，开假发票，并通过关系，找县里个别领导人为他们说情。纪承芳坚持原则，根据《药品管理法》的有关规定进行了处罚。
    纪承芳坚持原则，秉公执法，不徇私情的事迹不胫而走，在浦北县各族人民中传为佳话。为了把药品检验工作搞得更好，近两年来，纪承芳不顾自己年近“花甲”，经常爬山涉水带领全所人员深入全县２００多个医疗单位和医药店，宣传、贯彻《药品管理法》，积极检查收缴各种假劣药品，配合有关部门取缔各种不法药贩。
    据统计，近两年来，他们共检查收缴假劣药品８９种，３９００多斤。纪承芳每年检查１００多种药品，没出现一例差错。他领导的药检所被评为“全国先进县级药检所”，纪承芳也连续几年被评为县、地、自治区卫生文明先进工作者。
