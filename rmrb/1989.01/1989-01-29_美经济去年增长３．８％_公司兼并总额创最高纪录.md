    The U.S. economy grew by 3.8% in 1988, the highest level in four years, despite a severe drought that slowed growth by 0.4 percentage points, according to a report released by the U.S. Department of Commerce on January 27.

    The inflation rate in the United States in 1988 was 4.2%, higher than the 3.4% in 1987, marking the highest level since 1982.

    The sustained economic growth in the United States in 1988 was mainly due to significant improvements in the trade situation and a substantial increase in corporate fixed capital investment. That year, U.S. exports increased by 17.7%, while imports grew by only 8.3%; corporate fixed capital investment increased by 9.5%, far exceeding the 2.8% growth in 1987.

    According to statistics, the total value of corporate mergers in the United States in 1988 reached a record high of $226.3 billion. Some experts estimate that an additional $50 billion in transactions were not included in the statistics.

    In 1988, merger activities also set several other records: there were 41 mega-deals exceeding $10 billion, the highest number ever recorded. The total value of these mega-deals amounted to $95 billion, accounting for 42% of the disclosed transactions for the year. Foreign companies' merger activities in the United States also hit a record high, with a total value of $60.8 billion.

　　美经济去年增长３．８％    
    公司兼并总额创最高纪录
    新华社华盛顿１月２７日电  美国商务部２７日发表的报告说，尽管严重干旱使美国经济增长放慢０．４个百分点，１９８８年美国国民生产总值增长了３．８％，为过去４年内的最高水平。
    １９８８年美国的通货膨胀率为４．２％，高于１９８７年３．４％的水平，为１９８２年以来最高的。
    １９８８年美国经济持续增长，主要是由于外贸形势明显改善和企业固定资本投资大幅度增加。这一年，美国出口增加１７．７％，进口仅增长８．３％；企业固定资本投资增加９．５％，大大高于１９８７年增长２．８％的水平。
    据新华社纽约１月２７日电　（记者薛力敏）据统计，去年美国公司兼并总额创历史最高纪录，达到２２６３亿美元。有的专家估计，另外还有５００亿美元的交易没有统计在内。
    去年兼并活动还创下了另外几项纪录：交易额超过１０亿美元的巨额交易达到４１宗，是历史上最多的一年。这些巨额交易的总额多达９５０亿美元，占去年已公布的交易额的４２％。外国企业在美国的兼并活动去年也创下最高纪录，兼并总额达６０８亿美元。
