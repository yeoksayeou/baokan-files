The Ministry of Communications and the Civil Aviation Administration of China have each issued notices requiring local authorities to take measures to ensure safe travel during the upcoming Spring Festival.

The Ministry of Communications issued a notice stating that during the Spring Festival travel period, the inspection of dangerous goods must be strictly enforced, with clear regulations and simplified procedures, while maintaining a polite and courteous demeanor. The goal is to prevent dangerous goods from being brought onto vehicles and ships without causing additional inconvenience to passengers.

This year, the passenger volume for road and water transport is expected to reach 650 million trips, with road transport capacity increasing by 8% compared to the same period last year. The Ministry of Communications has made early preparations and proposed to take the explosion of two oil tankers on the Yangtze River as a warning, to strictly manage transportation and ensure safe travel during the Spring Festival. On January 10, a national transportation safety conference was held in Qingdao to make specific arrangements. Ministry of Communications Minister Qian Yongchang and Deputy Minister Wang Zhanyi have recently led inspection teams to East China, Guangdong, the Yangtze River, and North China to conduct safety inspections.

In response to past issues where inspection methods were overly simple and some passengers had complaints about the checks, the Ministry of Communications issued a special notice. It requires that during inspections, passengers should be encouraged to handle their own luggage, and after inspection, help should be provided to passengers to reorganize their belongings. Checkpoints should not be set up arbitrarily to prevent cumbersome procedures.

The Civil Aviation Administration of China has also issued a notice requiring local management bureaus, companies, and airports to strengthen the organization of safety and transportation production work. This year's Spring Festival travel volume is expected to increase compared to last year, especially with more Hong Kong, Macau, and overseas Chinese returning to visit relatives and travel. According to relevant departments, the number of Taiwanese compatriots returning home during this Spring Festival is expected to be significantly higher than in previous years. Therefore, the Civil Aviation Administration requires local authorities to grasp the passenger flow in advance, tap into potential capacity, ensure normal flights, and organize additional flights and charter flights for crowded routes. Priority should be given to ensuring that foreigners, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwanese compatriots, as well as overseas Chinese, can board flights.

The notice also requires local authorities to focus on safety work, strictly inspect luggage and cargo, and organize public security and transportation departments to maintain order at ticket offices, airports, and waiting rooms. Strict security management should be enforced to crack down on illegal activities such as ticket scalping. At the same time, all units should arrange air and ground services carefully, especially in cases of flight irregularities.

　　交通部、民航总局分别发出通知
    要求各地采取措施确保春运安全
    本报讯  为保证今年春运工作顺利完成，交通部、中国民航总局分别发出通知。交通部发出的通知说，对于春运期间危险品的检查，要做到严格要求，规定明确，手续简便，文明礼貌，既不使危险品被带上车船，又不给旅客带来更多麻烦。
    今年春运，公路、水运的客运量将达到６．５亿人次，其中公路运力将比去年同期增长８％。交通部及早做出部署，提出要以长江两艘油轮爆燃事件为警钟，严格运输管理，确保春运安全。１０日在青岛召开全国交通系统安全会议，进行具体部署。交通部长钱永昌，副部长王展意等日前已带领检查组，分赴华东、广东、长江、北方等地开展安全检查。
    针对以往春运检查方法比较简单，一些旅客对查堵有意见等情况，交通部专门发出通知，要求检查中尽可能由旅客自己动手，检查后要帮助旅客将行李物品整理好。检查站卡不要滥设，防止手续繁琐。

    又讯　为保证１９８９年春运工作顺利完成，中国民航总局日前发出通知，要求各地管理局、公司、航站的领导要深入第一线督促检查，加强安全和运输生产的具体组织工作。
    今年春运客流量预计比去年有所增加，特别是港澳同胞、华侨回内地探亲旅游日渐增多。据有关部门预测，今年春节台湾同胞回乡探亲的人数大大多于往年。因此，民航局要求各地要预先掌握旅客流量，挖掘潜力，除保证正常航班外，对拥挤的航线要组织加班、包机，重点保证外宾、港澳台同胞及华侨乘坐飞机。
    通知还要求各地要切实抓好安全工作，严格行李、货物的安全检查。要组织公安、运输等部门，维持好售票处、机场、候机室的秩序，严格治安管理，打击倒卖机票等不法活动。同时，各单位要认真安排好空中和地面的服务工作，特别是要做好航班不正常情况下的服务工作。
