	The major scientific research project in Zhejiang Province, "Research on Technology for Transforming Low-Yield Moso Bamboo Forests," has been successfully developed after seven years of dedicated research by scientists. Recently, it passed the provincial-level technical appraisal in Longyou County. This achievement has opened up a new path for addressing the issue of low-yield bamboo forests in China.

	Longyou County is a famous bamboo-producing area with 240,000 mu of bamboo forests, but 80% of them are low-yield forests. Since 1981, the Institute of Subtropical Forestry, Chinese Academy of Forestry, has been conducting research on "Technology for Transforming Low-Yield Moso Bamboo Forests" in collaboration with the county's forestry science institute. Through field surveys and analysis, they chose the technical approach of adjusting the bamboo forest structure and scientifically managing the soil. They also implemented a series of supporting technical measures, including retaining bamboo shoots to nurture bamboo, mountain cultivation, land clearing, rational logging, applying a small amount of fertilizer, and hooking branches to prevent snow damage. In 1986, Longyou County promoted this technology in 100,000 mu of bamboo forests, resulting in a 25% increase in the number of new bamboo shoots the following year, reaching over 20 million kilograms. The bamboo forests, bamboo shoots, and bamboo by-products increased by 480 million yuan.

	Experts and scholars who participated in the appraisal unanimously agreed that this research is at the forefront domestically and has promotion value in various low-yield bamboo-producing counties.

　　浙江龙游竹林喜获丰产
    毛竹低产林改造有新技术
    本报讯  浙江省重点科研项目——“毛竹低产林改造技术研究”，经过科研人员连续７年攻关，最近在龙游县通过了省级技术鉴定。该成果为改变我国竹林低产的局面拓开了一条新路子。
    龙游县是著名竹区，拥有２４万亩竹林，但８０％为低产林。１９８１年起，中国林业科学院亚热带林业研究所在该县进行“毛竹低产林改造技术研究”。他们在县林科所的协作下，通过实地勘察分析，选择了调节竹林结构、科学管理土壤的技术路线，并采取了留笋养竹、劈山抚育、林地清理、合理砍伐、少量施肥、钩梢防雪压等配套技术措施。１９８６年，龙游县在１０万亩竹林推广该项技术，使第二年新竹产株数增加２５％，达２０００多万公斤。竹林、竹笋和竹副产品增殖４８０万元。
    参加鉴定的专家、学者一致认为，该研究处于国内领先地位，在各低产竹林区县有推广价值。
