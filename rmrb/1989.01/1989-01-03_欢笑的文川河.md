Title: The Laughing Wenchuan River

The Wenchuan River is like a quiet girl, tiptoeing and hiding shyly through the forest. Under the autumn sun, her green dress is adorned with many colors—scarlet petals and fallen leaves, and white swans gliding through the water. Usually, the Wenchuan River's laughter is quite gentle, like a soft whisper, low and prolonged, a soothing melody that is mildly stimulating and suitable for all ages.

People often say, "The spring river warms first for the ducks," but the autumn water is also warm and gentle. With a layer of hazy autumn mist, the hidden waterfowl sway and play joyfully. After shooing away the stubborn geese, a few village girls squat down to wash clothes and vegetables, laughing merrily, unexpectedly becoming part of the scenic landscape. No wonder two female poets from Beijing, upon arriving, were immediately captivated, running along the riverbank, then suddenly stopping, raising their hands towards the upstream and shouting, "I hope to come to Hongtian Township often, such a wide thermal spring beach is rare. Perhaps it will be like this in the spring!"

Poets are sensitive. Where is the spring? Spring gushes out from the thermal spring eye, flows from the mineral water pump, and drifts with the pine resin scent over the mountains, rising in the autumn fields full of blossoms... It is not the spring breeze, but it is as good as the spring breeze. The ancient Wenchuan River is filled with laughter everywhere.

Everywhere there is laughter, cows mooing, and sheep bleating. We walk on the riverbank, and the riverbank cannot contain its joy—where the thermal springs gush out, there are sounds, like diamonds lightly colliding and humming softly, very pleasing to the ear. I particularly like the elegant hot spring by Rexi Village. The bottom of the pool, about ten square meters, is covered with large and small pebbles, smooth and shiny. It seems as if the stones are swaying, as if aquatic creatures are about to hatch. The water temperature reaches 40°C, so mist fills the air, and the boiling spring eye reaches over 100°C, enough to cook eggs. It is also used by the villagers for bathing. It is interesting to note that before it gets completely dark, the men enjoy it alone. In the misty atmosphere, there is both casual chatting and serious discussions. The hot spring becomes the village's social gathering place. When the night curtain falls to cover modesty, the women come in and take over, singing or coughing as a signal to avoid "collisions." The women, shedding their daily formalities, splash and play, lively and bustling. Even the most traditional women reveal their innocent nature...

We also know that the hot springs benefit the villagers. On the other side of the river, they are building a mushroom factory using the thermal steam to dry mushrooms for export. Then, they discharge the water with residual heat into the river, using the river water temperature to artificially raise leopard turtles that do not hibernate. The village head humorously opened his fingers to make a "turtle" gesture.

If the riverside villages have a wild charm, then the Guhu Lake mineral spring has more poetic charm. This is a rare large-scale high-quality mineral spring in the south, containing free carbon dioxide elements. It can compete with the Laoshan mineral spring and match the French Vichy mineral spring. It seems that the spring well is sealed, but the young manager is open-minded. With just a dozen people, they work diligently, and this "small business" is flowing towards the world. In the past, some foreigners visiting China would bring their own drinking water, but now they don't need to "show off." The outstanding Guhu water is worthy of being the queen of mineral springs, truly capable of making one fall in love at first sight. Civilized production, the spring well is uniquely built with an octagonal flower pavilion, with upturned eaves and flying tiles, both operational and scenic. Drinking mineral water while enjoying the scenery and chatting is extremely pleasant. Gazing at the three hundred-meter protection zone with red and green trees, we doubt we are in a newly built riverside park. The clouds are drifting, the water is flowing, and the people are leisurely. It is so touching and inspiring.

The sound of water flowing, I find that the Wenchuan River also has playful moments. It bounces off the rocks, creating whirlpools, like the dimples of a smiling face, bold and open, exuding a sense of ease and openness.

　　欢笑的文川河
    林万春
    文川河像一个文静的女孩子，蹑手蹑足又躲躲闪闪从丛林淌过。秋阳下，泛青的长裙漂起许多花色——彤红的是花瓣和落叶，雪白的是划动的鹅们。寻常，文川河的笑声也是挺文静的，就像咬唇发出的，低微而绵长，那是怡人的音乐吧，轻度刺激、老少皆宜。
    总是说“春江水暖鸭先知”，其实秋水也温和和的，何况罩上一层朦朦胧胧的秋雾，隐匿的水禽们摇来摆去撒开了欢。喝退了呆头鹅，几位农家女蹲下濯衣、洗菜，乐嘎嘎的，不期然也成了画中风景。难怪北京两位女诗人下车伊始，就着迷地沿着河滩小跑，又蓦然立定，伸起双手向上游喊道：“我希望常来洪田乡，这么宽广的温泉沙滩真少见，也许春天就在这里！”
    诗人是敏感的，春在哪里？春从温泉眼沸涌而出，在矿泉抽水机中流溢，随满山松脂香飘荡，于秋花灿烂的田野浮起……不是春风，胜似春风，古老的文川河到处飘拂着笑声。
    到处笑声，牛哞羊咩，我们走在河滩上，河滩也按捺不住喜悦——温泉喷溢的地方都发出声响，如钻石在轻轻撞碰悄悄吟啸，很是悦耳中听。我很喜欢热西村边的那口玲珑的温池，十多平方米的池底，隐约可见大大小小的鹅卵石，滑腻而有光泽，错觉中那石儿在晃荡，仿佛有水族将破壳而出。水温达４０℃，因而雾气弥漫，滚沸的泉眼处达１００℃多，可以煮熟鸡蛋。也供村民入浴。说来有意思，天未全黑时男子汉独享，氤氤氲氲之中，既有天南海北的闲聊，亦有庄重的“对策”，温池成了小村的社交所。夜幕可以遮羞时，女人们就大咧咧来占领阵地，交结班若怕“撞车”，不妨干咳或哼支歌为信号。浴女们卸去日间世俗戒规，裸裎相对，大家扑腾打闹，熙熙攘攘，再正统的女人们也欣然露出娇娃本色……我们还知道温泉造福村民，河那厢筹盖香菇厂利用温泉蒸汽烘干出口香菇，然后将留有余热的水排入河里，再利用河里水温人工养殖无冬眠甲鱼，村长诙谐地张开手指做了个“王八”的手势。
    如果说河畔村庄颇有野趣，那么贵湖矿泉却拥有更多的诗意。这是南方稀有的大型优质矿泉，含游离二氧化碳元素，既可以与崂山矿泉媲美，又可以与法国维希矿泉匹敌。看来泉井是封闭式的，年轻的经理却是开放型的，也不过十数人手，七鼓捣八鼓捣，这“小本生意”已源源不断走向世界。过去，有些外国人来华观光还携带饮用水，如今大可不必“班门弄斧”，佼佼贵湖水，堪称矿泉皇后，真可令人一见钟情。文明生产，泉井上别出心裁筑起八角花亭，翘角飞檐，琉瓦飞甍，既可操作，又可作瞭望，喝着矿泉水观景侃侃而谈，更是惬意极了。眺望在三百余米保护带红的花绿的树葳葳蕤蕤，我们直疑身临初建的河边公园，云悠悠水悠悠人亦悠悠，是这样叫人喜令人爱消人愁解人颐那样催人动容浮想连翩。
    水声潺潺，我发现文川河也有顽皮的时候，它在石头撞出浪转子，就像满脸欢笑荡出的酒涡，大大咧咧，生发出一种潇洒和开放之美。
