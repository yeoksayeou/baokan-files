Capital Airport places a strong emphasis on improving the quality of its public security officers. Those with a college or vocational education now make up 50 percent.

    The Beijing Capital Airport has been focusing on enhancing the quality of its public security officers. In the past year, there have been no instances of lawlessness or wrongful convictions in the handling of criminal, public security, and international incidents, earning praise from higher authorities.

    Previously, the Beijing Civil Aviation Public Security Bureau had only 0.5 percent of its officers with a college education or higher, resulting in a low cultural knowledge base and poor professional skills among the officers. This was inadequate for the increasing passenger flow at the airport and the growing need for scientific and internationalized security management and facilities. To address this, the airport's public security leadership decided to systematically and targetedly improve the cultural quality of the officers. They allocated special funds to establish a legal studies class through the Central Radio and Television University, invited legal scholars to teach, and organized a legal vocational class. Additionally, they encouraged officers to enroll in part-time or correspondence universities related to their professional duties without leaving their jobs. Currently, 50 percent of the airport's officers have a vocational education or higher, with 27 percent having a college education. The increase in legal knowledge and professional training has improved the officers' work capabilities. Last year, the Beijing Civil Aviation Public Security Bureau solved a major case of air ticket scalping at the Capital Airport. Officers Liu Yang and Feng Wei, with the support of other colleagues, applied their knowledge of economic law to carefully analyze the case, ultimately uncovering a 400,000 yuan fraud case. They recovered over 10,000 yuan in economic losses for the affected unit and were both awarded third-class merit citations.

　　首都机场重视提高公安干警素质    
    具有大中专文化程度者已占百分之五十
    本报讯  首都机场注重提高公安干警素质，在去年处理的刑事、治安案件和涉外事件中，没有发生任何违法乱纪和冤假错案现象，受到上级领导的表彰。
    过去，民航北京公安处具有大专以上文化程度的只占０．５％，干警的文化知识结构低，业务素质和工作能力较差，不适应机场客流量逐年增大，各种治安管理、安全设施的科学化、国际化需要。为此，机场公安方面的负责同志决定有组织、有针对性地帮助干警提高文化素质，他们首先拨出专项经费，开设了中央电大法律系视听班，邀请法学界教师讲课，主办法律中专班。同时，还鼓励在职干警报考与本职业务有关、不脱产的职工业余大学和函授大学。现在，机场干警具有中专以上文化水平的占５０％，其中大专文化水平占２７％。法律知识的增长和业务学习，提高了干警的工作能力。去年，民航北京公安处在首都机场查破一起重大倒卖飞机票案件，干警刘阳、冯卫两人在其他同志配合下，运用所学的经济法知识，认真分析案情，终于追查出一起４０余万元的诈骗案件，为受害单位追回上万元的经济损失，分别荣立三等功。
