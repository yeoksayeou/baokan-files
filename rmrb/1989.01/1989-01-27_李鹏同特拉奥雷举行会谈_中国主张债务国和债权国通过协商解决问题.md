Li Peng Holds Talks with Traore
China Advocates for Debtor and Creditor Nations to Resolve Issues Through Negotiation

BEIJING, Jan. 26 (Xinhua) — Reporter Sun Yi: Today, President Moussa Traore of Mali, who is also the Chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), told Premier Li Peng that the friendly and cooperative relationship between China and Mali, as well as other African countries, serves as a model for international cooperation.

President Traore made these remarks during his meeting with Premier Li Peng this morning at the Great Hall of the People.

During the talks, both sides exchanged views on major issues, including the current international situation, the situation in Africa, African debt, and bilateral relations.

Premier Li Peng said that the current international situation shows signs of easing, as evidenced by the first steps taken by the two superpowers in arms reduction, although the steps are not significant. We have given due recognition to these efforts. Many hotspot issues are beginning to show signs of resolution, which is in the interest of developing countries. He emphasized that while we particularly hope for peace, we must also be aware that there are still unstable factors in this easing situation. Therefore, we cannot be complacent. Some hotspot issues remain unresolved, and others, although in the process of resolution, harbor new contradictions.

Regarding the situation in Africa, Premier Li Peng said that the hotspot issues in Africa are being resolved, and we are pleased to see this. He believed that the problems in Southern Africa and Western Sahara are being addressed primarily due to the long-term efforts of African countries, especially the frontline states and their peoples; secondly, due to the significant role played by the OAU; and thirdly, due to the long-term mediation efforts of the United Nations Secretary-General. We appreciate these efforts. Li reaffirmed China's consistent support for the struggle of the Namibian people for independence and hoped that relevant parties would further consult to reach a consensus on the specific implementation of Resolution 435.

On the debt issue, Li said that the debt problem is no longer a simple matter between debtor and creditor nations but has become an issue of the international economic order. There exists an irrational economic order internationally, and the economic relations between developing and developed countries are conducted under unequal and non-equivalent exchange conditions. Non-equivalent exchange makes the rich richer and the poor poorer, which brings instability to the regional situation. He said that the debt issue is a serious political problem. We advocate that debtor and creditor nations should resolve issues through negotiation, and creditor nations bear a greater responsibility. They should take lenient measures to solve the problem, which is beneficial for both debtor and creditor nations. Some creditor nations use the debt issue to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, which is unacceptable.

Regarding bilateral relations, Premier Li Peng said that in the nearly thirty years since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Mali, the two countries have maintained good relations. Especially since President Traore took office, the relationship between the two countries has been elevated to a new level, and we are satisfied with this.

President Traore believed that the African region has seen a good prospect for achieving peace, but we must not forget that Africa is facing economic difficulties. We have formulated a plan to revitalize the African economy and call on the international community to help Africa revitalize its economy.

Traore said that African countries acknowledge that repaying debts is a moral obligation. He suggested convening an international conference on the African debt issue, linking the debt issue with Africa's development.

Regarding bilateral relations, Traore said that China and Mali, as well as other African countries, have friendly relations. He, on behalf of the Malian people, party, and government, expressed gratitude to the great Chinese people for their unremitting efforts in fostering friendship and fruitful cooperation between the two countries. Foreign Minister Qian Qichen attended the talks.

　　李鹏同特拉奥雷举行会谈    
    中国主张债务国和债权国通过协商解决问题
    本报北京一月二十六日讯  记者孙毅报道：马里共和国总统、非洲统一组织执行主席穆萨·特拉奥雷今天向李鹏总理说，中国和马里及非洲国家的友好合作关系堪称楷模，是国际合作的典范。
    特拉奥雷总统的这番话是今天上午在人民大会堂同李鹏总理会谈时讲的。
    会谈时，双方就当前国际形势、非洲形势、包括非洲债务以及两国关系等重大问题交换了意见。
    李鹏总理说，现在国际上出现了缓和的形势，表现在“两超”在裁军方面迈出了第一步，尽管步伐不够大，但是我们给予了应有的评价。许多热点问题开始出现了解决的趋势，热点问题的解决符合发展中国家的利益。他说，我们特别希望和平，但是应该看到，在缓和的形势中仍然存在着不安定的因素，因此不能放松警惕。有的热点问题还没有解决，有的虽然正在解决，但是隐藏着新的矛盾。
    在谈到非洲形势时，李鹏总理说，非洲的热点问题正在解决，对此我们表示高兴。李鹏总理认为，南部非洲问题和西撒问题正在解决，首先是由于非洲国家、特别是前线国家和人民长期努力的结果；二是由于非统组织起了重大的作用；三是联合国秘书长长期进行的斡旋努力的结果。对此我们表示赞赏。李鹏重申，我们一贯支持纳米比亚人民争取独立的斗争，他希望有关方面进一步协商，就具体实施四三五号决议达成一致意见。
    关于债务问题，李鹏说，债务问题已不是一个简单的债务国和债权国的关系问题，而是一个国际经济秩序问题。国际上存在着不合理的经济秩序，发展中国家和发达国家的经济关系是在不平等的、不等价交换的情况下进行的。不等价交换使富的越富、穷的越穷，这就给地区形势带来了不安定因素。他说，债务问题是严重的政治问题，我们主张债务国和债权国之间应该通过协商解决问题，对此，债权国负有更大的责任，应该采取宽容的措施来解决问题，这对于债务国和债权国都是有利的。有些债权国家利用债务问题干涉它国的内政，这是不能容许的。
    在谈到双边关系时，李鹏总理说，中马建交近三十年来，两国关系是很好的，特别是特拉奥雷总统执政以来把两国关系提高到一个新的水平，我们对此表示满意。
    特拉奥雷总统认为，非洲地区已出现了实现和平的良好前景，但是不能忘记，非洲正面临着经济困难，我们曾制定振兴非洲经济计划，呼吁国际社会帮助非洲振兴经济。
    特拉奥雷说，非洲国家承认还债是一项道义上的义务。他建议召开关于非洲债务问题的国际会议，把债务问题同非洲的发展结合起来。
    在谈到双边关系时，特拉奥雷说，中国和马里及非洲有着友好的关系。他代表马里人民、党和政府向伟大的中国人民表示感谢，感谢中国人民为培育两国之间的友谊和富有成果的合作而进行的不懈努力。外交部长钱其琛参加了会谈。
