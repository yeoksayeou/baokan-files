The Agricultural Bank of China has decided to comprehensively adjust the interest rate policies of credit unions. First, for credit unions' term deposits of over three years before the end of 1988, the method of "high in, high out" will be adopted to raise loan interest rates to address some of the losses. For the new value-preserving deposits opened this year, if credit unions themselves cannot absorb them, they can be handled on behalf of the Agricultural Bank, which will pay a handling fee for the deposits.

Second, the interest rates for transactions between banks and credit unions will be adjusted. The interest rate for the portion of credit unions' deposit reserves that is the same as that of specialized banks will be raised to be consistent with the interest rate for specialized bank deposit reserves. The interest rate for the portion exceeding the proportion will be raised from 8.64% per annum to 11.34%. The interest rate for credit unions' reserve funds will be adjusted from 6.48% per annum to 9%, which is 0.36 percentage points higher than the interest rate for specialized bank reserve funds.

Third, for credit unions' loans to agriculture, except for loans for grain, cotton, and oil production costs, which will be controlled within a 30% floating range, the interest rates for other agricultural loans can be adjusted within a 50% floating range based on their bearing capacity. For loans to other sectors, the interest rates can be high in, high out, even approaching market interest rates, but they must be implemented after approval by the People's Bank of China.

　　农行将调整信用社利率政策    
    除粮棉油其他可在百分之五十以内浮动
    本报讯  本报记者江夏、新华社记者焦然报道：记者获悉：农业银行总行决定将全面调整信用社的利率政策。首先，对１９８８年底以前信用社３年以上定期储蓄，可以采取高来高去提高贷款利率的办法解决部分亏损问题。对于今年新开办的保值储蓄，信用社自身难以消化的，可代农业银行办理，由农业银行按代办储蓄付给手续费。
    其次，调整银行和信用社往来利率。信用社存款准备金与专业银行同比例部分，其利率调高到与专业银行准备金利率一致；超过比例部分，其利率由年息８．６４％上调为１１．３４％。信用社的备付金利率由年息６．４８％调为９％，比专业银行的备付金利率高０．３６个百分点。
    第三，信用社对农业的贷款利率，除粮、棉、油生产费用贷款利率掌握在３０％以内浮动外，其他农业贷款利率可以视其承受能力在５０％以内浮动；对其他各业的贷款利率，可高进高出、甚至接近市场利率，但需报人民银行批准后才能执行。
