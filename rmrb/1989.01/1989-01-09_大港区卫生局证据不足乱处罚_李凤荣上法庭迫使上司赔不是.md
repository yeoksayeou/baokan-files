Recently, the Dagu Court, while hearing an administrative case related to health, saw the Dagu District Health Bureau withdraw its decision due to insufficient evidence, leading to the case being terminated after the plaintiff withdrew the lawsuit.

On June 24, 1988, the Tianjin Dagu District Health Bureau issued document number 6, stating that Li Fengrong, a village doctor from Hongxing Village in Taiping Town, Dagu District, had sold a fake medicine called "bloodstone" made from bricks, violating Article 33, Section 2 of Chapter 5 of the "Pharmaceutical Administration Law of the People's Republic of China." As a result, his medical practice license (number 06889) was revoked. Li was dissatisfied with the district health bureau's penalty and filed a lawsuit with the Dagu District Court's Administrative Division on August 23, 1988.

The Dagu District Court accepted the case on September 12 of last year. After investigation, it was found that the plaintiff, Li Fengrong, was a village doctor trained before the Cultural Revolution. In 1983, he took over the village clinic, and in January 1988, the village took back the clinic and added two more staff members. These two individuals, who did not have medical practice licenses, also frequently saw patients and sold medicines. In February of last year, someone discovered fake "bloodstone" made from bricks in the market. The Dagu District Health Bureau's penalty decision was based on an anonymous letter that only mentioned the incident of selling bricks as "bloodstone" to deceive the public, without pointing out any specific individuals. Additionally, no evidence was provided to prove that Li Fengrong sold fake medicines. Therefore, it was impossible to determine that Li was the manufacturer and seller of the fake medicines. Moreover, the "Pharmaceutical Administration Law" does not have a clause that revokes an individual's medical practice license.

During the lawsuit, the Dagu District Health Bureau realized that their decision lacked sufficient evidence. They corrected their mistake by issuing document number 9 on October 15 of last year, revoking document number 6. They also apologized to Li Fengrong. The plaintiff, Li Fengrong, agreed to withdraw the lawsuit, and this health administrative case was thus terminated.

### 大港区卫生局证据不足乱处罚　李凤荣上法庭迫使上司赔不是

　　大港区卫生局证据不足乱处罚
  　李凤荣上法庭迫使上司赔不是
    本报讯  最近大港法院在审理一起卫生行政案件时，由于大港区卫生局在诉讼中撤销了自己的无据裁决，案件因原告撤诉终结。
    １９８８年６月２４日，天津市大港区卫生局下达港卫药字（１９８８）第６号文件认定，大港区太平镇红星村乡医李凤荣以砖头冒充药品血竭出售，违反《中华人民共和国药品管理法》第５章第３３条第２项规定，吊销其乡医字第０６８８９号行医执照。李不服区卫生局对自己的处罚，于１９８８年８月２３日向大港区法院行政庭起诉。
    大港区法院于去年９月１２日立案，后经审理查明，原告李凤荣系文革前培养起来的乡医，１９８３年承包村卫生所，１９８８年１月村里将卫生所收回村委会管理，又增加两名人员。这两名没有行医执照的“医生”，也经常看病卖药。去年２月，有人在市上发现名为血竭实为砖头的假药。大港卫生局所作出的处罚决定，是根据一封只介绍把砖头当血竭卖欺骗群众之事，未指出具体人的匿名信，也没提供任何能证明李凤荣出售假药的证据，所以，无法认定李为假药的制造者和销售者。同时，在《药品管理法》的法律责任中，也没有吊销个人行医执照的条款。
    大港区卫生局在诉讼中认识到自己的处理决定证据不足后，本着知错就改的态度，于去年１０月１５日以港卫药字（１９８８）第９号文件，撤销了港卫药字（１９８８）第６号文件，向李凤荣认错，原告李凤荣也同意撤诉，这一起卫生行政案件遂告终结。
