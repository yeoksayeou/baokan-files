One of the two oil barges that exploded on the Yangtze River within Hubei Province is still burning fiercely today, with thick smoke billowing out, but the fire has been largely brought under control.

Deputy General Manager of the Yangtze River Shipping Company and the on-site commander, Xu Qingyi, told reporters: According to on-site inspections by the Hubei Provincial and Wuhan Municipal Environmental Protection Bureaus, the water quality of the Yangtze River has not been seriously polluted, but air pollution is continuing. He believes that since the barge has run aground and is stationary, the risk of it drifting into the Wuhan urban area is not significant.

The maritime authorities have sealed the original records in the barge's cabin and will conduct an in-depth investigation into the cause of the accident.

　　长江燃爆油驳中的一艘仍在燃烧
    据新华社武汉１月４日电（记者方政军）在湖北境内长江江面上燃爆的两艘油驳中一艘今天仍然浓烟滚滚，继续燃烧，但火势基本得到控制。
    长江轮船总公司副总经理、事故现场总指挥徐清义告诉记者：据湖北省和武汉市环保局现场测检，长江水质没有造成严重污染，但空中污染正在继续。他认为由于油驳已搁浅定位，继续飘流进入武汉市区的危险性不大。
    航政部门已查封油驳驾驶室上的有关原始记录，将深入调查事故原因。
