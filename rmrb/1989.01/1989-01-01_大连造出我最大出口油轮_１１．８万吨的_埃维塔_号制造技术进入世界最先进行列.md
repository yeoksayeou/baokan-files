Dalian Builds China's Largest Export Oil Tanker
118,000-ton "Evita" Represents World's Most Advanced Technology

According to Xinhua News Agency, Dalian, December 31, 1988 (Reporter Li Xiaolin) China's largest export vessel was delivered on December 30 in Dalian. The 118,000-ton shuttle oil tanker named "Evita" was built by the Dalian Shipyard for the Norwegian Ugelstad Company.

This oil tanker, which is as high as a 17-story building and has a deck the size of two football fields, uses twin-engine twin-screw propulsion. It is equipped with shaft-driven generators, shaft-driven hydraulic pump stations, and variable-pitch propellers. It also has a 24-hour unmanned engine room and satellite navigation equipment, making it one of the most advanced and automated ships in the world today. So far, only a few countries have the capability to build such high-level vessels.
