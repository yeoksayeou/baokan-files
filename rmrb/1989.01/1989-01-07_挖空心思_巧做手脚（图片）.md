	“How much to alter one invoice?”

	“Three jiao.”

	Immediately, the young woman asking the price took out an invoice, and the young man selling the correction fluid handed her a cotton swab. She dipped it in the correction fluid and started rubbing. The transaction was completed in an instant.

	This scene took place not long ago in front of the Zhengzhou Department Store, which I witnessed with my own eyes.

	For many years, accounting staff have found it most troublesome to audit invoices and reimbursement vouchers. Often, there are those who seek small gains, racking their brains and pulling strings.

	Correction fluid, as a commodity, is blameless, but for those who use it to defraud the state of money, there should be a way to deal with them.

    挖空心思  巧做手脚
    “改一张发票多少钱？”
    “三角。”
    随即见那问价的女青年掏出一张发票，接过卖消字灵的小伙子递给的棉球小棒，蘸上消字灵药液涂抹起来，立即完成了一笔“交易”。
    这是不久前我在郑州市百货大楼门前亲眼所见。
    多年以来，财会人员最感头痛的是审查发票、报销凭证。往往有那么一些贪图小利的人，挖空心思，巧做手脚。
    消字灵作为商品是无责任的，但对那些用消字灵骗取国家钱财的人，应当有个办法来对付。
