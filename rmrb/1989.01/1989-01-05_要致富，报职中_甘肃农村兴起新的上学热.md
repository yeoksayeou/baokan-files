	“To Get Rich, Enroll in Vocational School”

	A New Wave of Education Enthusiasm in Rural Gansu

	Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, January 4th – (Reporter Cao Yong'an) While a new wave of "studying is useless" is rising in some places, rural Gansu is experiencing a new surge in education enthusiasm.

	The positive signs in Gansu's rural education are thought-provoking. In early 1985, the principal and teachers of the comprehensive middle school in Dianzi Township, He Shu County, tracked and visited their graduates. The couplet written by Liu Wen and Liu Wu on their door stung the principal's heart: "Short of clothes, short of food, short of money to spend, no wife, no children, no grandchildren." The horizontal scroll read: "One person struggles on." The principal and teachers fell into deep thought: Why, after failing the college entrance exam, did Liu Wen and Liu Wu neither excel in literature nor in martial arts, living in such dire straits? What did the rural children learn after 12 years of hard study?

	The responsible comrades of the educational departments at various levels in Gansu Province were also reflecting: Hui Ning County sends hundreds of students to key national colleges and universities every year. Among the high-tech talent-dense area of Beijing's Zhongguancun, there are 40 people from Hui Ning County. However, the talent-rich Hui Ning County remains poor and backward. What does this mean?

	People realized that the ratio of students entering higher education each year to those entering primary school each year in Gansu is 3:97. For a long time, the promotion-oriented education has been pursued, but has it dropped the watermelon to pick the sesame?

	Provincial Party Secretary Li Zichi said, although we also need high-level talents, economically backward Gansu cannot follow the path of blindly pursuing high admission rates. It is not easy for rural children to go to school. They hope to learn genuine skills for production and wealth, to change the poor and backward face of their hometown. Starting from 1985, the educational landscape in rural Gansu began to change. They established and reformed more than 160 vocational middle schools based on the economic realities of different regions across the province, and added various vocational and technical training in the graduating classes of primary schools in remote mountainous and pastoral areas, transforming the promotion-oriented education into education that improves the quality of ordinary laborers.

	After four years of reforming the comprehensive middle school in Dianzi Township, He Shu County into a vocational middle school, they gained new information during their follow-up visits: 1,200 graduates had an average income of over 400 yuan, 70 yuan higher than the county's average income. This school also led 10 nearby villages to prosperity. The social benefits of vocational schools became the most vivid and concrete "persuasive essay" for education. Local farmers eagerly sent their children to school. Farmers said: "In the past, studying was like a blind man lighting a lamp; now, going to school is like planting a tree for shade." "To get rich, enroll in vocational school" has become a new proverb in rural Gansu. In 1988, the ratio of applicants for vocational middle schools to ordinary middle schools in some regions of Gansu reached 10:1. So far, nearly 60,000 graduates from vocational middle schools in rural Gansu have shown their prowess in production and wealth creation. They are like yeast, reversing the disinterest in studying among more rural children. Over the past three years, the enrollment rate and retention rate of rural children in Gansu have continued to increase. Recently, the responsible comrades of the State Education Commission visited Gansu and highly praised the changes in rural education here.

### “要致富，报职中”  甘肃农村兴起新的上学热

　　“要致富，报职中”
    甘肃农村兴起新的上学热
    新华社兰州１月４日电  （记者曹永安）在新的“读书无用”风在不少地方乍起的时候，甘肃农村却兴起了新的上学热。
    甘肃农村教育出现的好兆头耐人寻味。１９８５年初，合水县店子乡完全中学校长和教师跟踪查访他们的毕业生，刘文、刘武两兄弟在家门上写的对联刺疼了校长的心：“缺衣缺粮缺钱花，无妻无子无孙子”，横批是“一人混吧”。校长、教师都陷入了沉重的思索：为什么刘文、刘武高考落第后既不能文又不能武，生活如此窘迫？农家孩子寒窗１２载，究竟学到了什么？
    甘肃省各级教育部门的负责同志也在思索：会宁县年年高考有数百名学生考入全国重点大专院校，仅北京中关村高科技人才密集区，会宁县籍的人才就有４０名。然而人才辈出的会宁县却依然贫穷落后，这又意味着什么？
    人们反省到，甘肃每年进入高等院校的学生与每年入小学学习的学生，比例为３∶９７。长期以来推行的升学教育，是否丢了西瓜，只拣到芝麻。
    省委书记李子奇说，高层次的人才虽然我们也需要，但经济落后的甘肃，教育不能走盲目追求升学率的路。农家孩子上学不容易，他们希望学到生产致富的真本领，改变家乡贫穷落后的面貌。从１９８５年起，甘肃农村教育的格局逐步发生了变化。他们从全省不同地区的经济实际出发，新办和改办了１６０多所职业中学，并在边远山区和牧区小学毕业班增设了多种职业技术培训，变升学教育为提高普通劳动者素质的教育。
    合水县店子乡完全中学改办为职业中学４年，他们在回访中获得了新的信息：毕业生１２００余名，人均收入都在４００元以上，比全县人均收入高出７０元。这所学校还带动了附近的１０个村庄致富。职业中学的社会效益成了最生动、具体的“劝学篇”，当地农民纷纷送子女上学。农民说：过去读书是“瞎子点灯”；现在上学是“种树得荫”。“要致富，报职中”，已成为甘肃农村的新民谚。１９８８年，甘肃农村报考职业中学和普通中学的比例，有些地区已达１０∶１。迄今为止，甘肃农村已有近６万名职业中学的毕业生在生产致富中大显身手。他们像酵母一样，让更多农家孩子的厌学情绪发生逆转。３年来，甘肃省农村孩子的入学率、巩固率持续增长。前不久，国家教委的负责同志来甘肃视察，对这里农村教育发生的变化给予了高度评价。
