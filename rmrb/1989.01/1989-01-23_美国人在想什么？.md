The 41st President of the United States has been sworn in. How do Americans view the new government? What are they thinking about and concerned with? From January 12 to 15, the New York Times and the Columbia Broadcasting Company jointly conducted a sample public opinion poll of 1,533 adults in 48 states, excluding Alaska and Hawaii. The results indicate that the majority of Americans are optimistic about the state of the nation and the new president, and are satisfied with their current living conditions. However, they also say that the new president may not be able to solve the two most important issues on the current agenda—federal budget deficits and drug abuse.

Currently, Americans' moods have changed significantly compared to a few years ago. For example, four years ago, people were worried about the threat of nuclear war, but now, due to improved U.S.-Soviet relations, this fear has been replaced by domestic issues.

Among domestic issues, whether the government will increase taxes to reduce the budget deficit has become a hot topic of discussion and the most reported news. The majority of those surveyed do not believe President Bush's campaign promise of "no new taxes." 73% of people think that in the next four years, the new government will likely ask Congress to raise taxes, as the current annual budget deficit is approximately $155 billion. College graduates are more sensitive to this issue, calling the budget deficit the number one problem in the United States. Therefore, 58% of those surveyed believe that military spending should not be increased, 24% think that military spending should be reduced from the current level, and only 14% support increasing military spending.

Drug abuse is another major concern. 69% of those surveyed believe that the federal government should allocate more funds to combat drug abuse, and 51% say they are willing to pay an additional $100 in federal taxes annually to support anti-drug efforts.

Different social strata have different evaluations of the current situation in the United States. Generally, the evaluations of men are higher than those of women, and whites are higher than blacks. Opinions on the future of the U.S. economy also vary. Most people hope that the economy in four years will be similar to the current situation, 22% believe it will be better, but 12% think the economy will worsen.

　　美国人在想什么？
    本报记者  张启昕
    美国第４１任总统已宣誓就职。美国人对新政府的看法如何？他们想的和关心的是什么？１月１２日至１５日，《纽约时报》和哥伦比亚广播公司联合对美国除阿拉斯加和夏威夷之外的４８个州的１５３３名成年人作了一次抽样民意调查。调查结果表明，多数美国人对国家现状和新总统表示乐观，对今天的生活状况感到满意，但他们也说，新总统未必就能解决当前日程上最重要的两个问题——联邦财政赤字和吸毒问题。
    目前，美国人的情绪与几年前相比，起了不小变化。譬如说，４年前，人们担心核战争威胁，而现在由于美苏关系改善，这种恐惧心理已为国内问题所替代。
    在国内诸问题中，政府是否增税以减少财政赤字，成为人们议论纷纭、新闻报道最多的热门话题。被调查的大多数美国人不大相信布什总统在竞选时作出的“不增加新的税收”的诺言。７３％的人认为，在今后４年中新政府很可能会要求国会提高税收，因为现在每年的财政赤字约１５５０亿美元。大学毕业生对此更为敏感，把财政赤字称为美国的头号问题。由此，５８％被调查的人主张军费不应再增加，２４％的人认为军费应该从现有水平减下来，只有１４％的人主张增加军费。
    吸毒泛滥是人们忧虑的另一个问题。６９％被调查的人认为，联邦政府应拿出更多的钱来扫毒，还有５１％的人说，他们愿意一年多给联邦交１００美元税金支助反毒。
    对于美国的现状，各个阶层的评价不一，一般来说，被调查的男人的评价高于妇女，白人高于黑人。对于美国经济的前景，想法也不一。大多数人希望４年之后的经济能与现在相差不远，也有２２％的人认为会好一些，但有１２％的人估计经济会恶化。
