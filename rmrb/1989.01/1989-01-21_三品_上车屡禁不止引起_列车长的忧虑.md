The upcoming spring transportation season is approaching, and Premier Li Peng has reminded railway workers three times in half a month to redouble their efforts, strengthen management, enforce discipline, overcome difficulties, and ensure safe train operations. We, the 115 train conductors of the Zhengzhou Passenger Transportation Section, deeply feel the heavy responsibility on our shoulders.

The presence of "three hazardous items" (flammable, explosive, and toxic substances) on trains poses a major threat to the safety of passenger trains. According to statistics from relevant departments, in 1988, an average of 240 cases of illegal carrying of "three hazardous items" were discovered daily. Looking at the situation with the 19.5 pairs of passenger trains we are responsible for, last year alone, we discovered a total of 3,989 kilograms of explosives, kerosene, and paint. How much more must have gone undetected?

Some people, for personal gain, disregard the repeated bans by the State Council and various ministries and commissions on carrying "three hazardous items" on trains. They use various methods to evade inspections. This spring transportation season, the number of passengers is expected to increase by 4% compared to last year, with our bureau alone expecting 3,690,000 passengers. With such a large number of passengers, relying solely on the railway department to manage and inspect is not enough. Therefore, we appeal to leaders in all industries to pay attention to this issue. At the same time, we also hope that the state will expedite the formulation of the "Railway Law" to create a good external environment for the safe operation of railways.

　　“三品”上车屡禁不止引起——    
    列车长的忧虑
    编辑同志：
    春运即将开始，李鹏总理在半个月内三次提醒铁路干部职工要加倍努力，加强管理，严格纪律，克服困难，确保行车安全。我们郑州客运段１１５名列车长深感自己肩上责任重大。
    “三品”（易燃品、易爆品、有毒物品）上车是危及旅客列车行车安全的一个重大隐患。据有关部门统计，１９８８年平均每天查出违章携带“三品”上车达２４０起。以我们担负的１９．５对旅客列车的情况看，去年查出的炸药、煤油、油漆总数达３９８９公斤，那些没有被发现的又该有多少呢？
    一些人为了谋取个人利益，置国务院各部委三令五申严禁携带“三品”乘车的规定于不顾，采用各种手法对付检查，今年春运期间乘车人数比去年增加４％，仅我们分局就将有３６９万名旅客乘车，如此众多的旅客，仅靠铁路部门去管、去查是不够的。因此，我们呼吁各行各业的领导都应该抓一抓这事。同时，我们也希望国家应尽快制定《铁路法》，为铁路安全运行创造良好的外部环境。 　　　　　　　　　郑州铁路分局客运段１１５名列车长
