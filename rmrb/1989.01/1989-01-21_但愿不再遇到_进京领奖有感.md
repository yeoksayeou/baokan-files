My news photography work "Severely Punish Human Traffickers" won the first prize in the People's Daily Hua Lian News Photography Contest. I felt both excited and surprised. I was excited because, as a reporter for 8 years, to receive such an honor was too happy; I was surprised because such a social issue news was actually used by the Party Central Committee's organ, and even won the first prize.

On January 17, I received a telegram from the People's Daily, and I eagerly wanted to rush to Beijing to receive the award. Because the award ceremony was approaching, that afternoon, the Guizhou Evening News sent a special car to take me to the Guizhou Airport. I waited anxiously at the ticket refund window. An hour passed, but no one called for a refund, and my heart was racing. There was also a couple in their fifties waiting for a ticket, their faces streaked with tears and furrowed with worry. It turned out that their daughter had been kidnapped and taken away from home for half a year. Yesterday, they suddenly received a telegram from their daughter in Qiqihar, Heilongjiang Province, so they packed their bags and came to the airport to wait for a refund. The uncle, holding the telegram, tearfully told me, "I have never flown in an airplane in my life. My daughter has been missing for so long, and when we received the telegram, we were both shocked and overjoyed. We hugged and cried, and we will borrow money to go to Qiqihar as soon as possible." When the Li Fazuo, the director of the Transportation Department of the Guizhou Civil Aviation Bureau, and the staff of the check-in crew learned of the couple's situation, they enthusiastically helped them buy the only ticket available at the Guizhou Airport at that time to Beijing. As he boarded the airplane, the uncle was so moved that tears welled up in his eyes. He was lucky to board the plane, but could he find his daughter? I was worried for him.

　　但愿不再遇到……
    ——进京领奖有感
    贵阳晚报记者  彭年
    我的新闻摄影作品《严惩人贩子》荣获人民日报华联新闻摄影比赛一等奖，我感到既兴奋，又意外。兴奋的是，自己当记者８年能获此殊荣，太高兴了；意外的是，像这样的社会问题新闻居然被党中央机关报采用了，而且获一等奖。
    １月１７日，我接到人民日报社发来的电报，便急不可待地想奔赴北京领奖。由于颁奖时间临近，当天下午贵阳晚报派专车送我到贵阳飞机场。我怀着忐忑不安的心情守候在退票窗口。一个小时过去了，仍未有人喊退票，我的心像猫抓似的。与我候票的还有一对年近５０岁的夫妇，脸上泪痕斑斑，愁眉不展。原来，他们的女儿被人拐骗离家，已有半年之久。昨天突然接到女儿从黑龙江省齐齐哈尔市发来的电报，便打点行李到机场等退票来了。大伯手持电报含泪对我说，我一辈子没坐过飞机，女儿外出一直下落不明，收到电报后，我们老两口又惊又喜，抱头痛哭，就是借钱也要及时赶到齐齐哈尔去。当贵阳民航局运输科的李法科长和值机组的同志知道老两口的情况后，热情帮助他们买到了贵阳机场当时仅有的一张飞往北京的飞机票。登上飞机舷梯，那位大伯感动得眼泪盈眶。他幸运地登上飞机了，但他能找回自己的女儿吗？我在为他担心。
