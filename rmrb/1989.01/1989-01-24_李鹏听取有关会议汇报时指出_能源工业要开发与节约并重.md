Li Peng, while listening to a report on a national energy conference, emphasized that the energy industry should focus on both development and conservation.

New China News Agency reporter Zhao Mingliang and People's Daily reporter Liu Xiaoyang reported from Beijing on January 23: Premier Li Peng today, in Zhongnanhai, listened to a report on the national energy conference and pointed out that China's energy development strategy should emphasize both development and conservation, ensuring stable development in the energy industry.

Comrades Yao Yilin and Zhou Jiaxua also attended today's meeting.

After listening to the report by Energy Minister Huang Yicheng on the current energy situation and the development plan for the energy industry, Premier Li Peng said that the energy industry has made significant progress in recent years, particularly in power generation, which reached 100 million kilowatts in installed capacity last year, a remarkable achievement by global standards. The achievements in the energy industry have supported reform, opening up, and national economic construction, and reform and opening up have also brought vitality to the energy industry. In recent years, the petroleum industry has implemented the "responsibility system" for the entire industry; the coal industry has adopted a policy of developing large, medium, and small mines simultaneously, with state-owned mines also implementing the "responsibility system"; coal supply has been managed through a unified production, transportation, and sales accounting system; power generation has adopted collective funding for power projects and is currently undergoing power management system reforms. These reform measures have significantly promoted the development of the energy industry.

Li Peng said that the current energy shortage is due to complex reasons, with issues in coal mines, railways, and power plants. However, the main problem is the insufficient transportation capacity of the railways.

Li Peng pointed out that the transportation of coal from Shanxi must be managed through a unified accounting system. Whether it is within the plan or outside the plan, all coal must be included in the national transportation plan. This way, not only can the demand for coal be met, but it can also eliminate the practice of using railway cars for personal gain.

Premier Li Peng especially pointed out that the fundamental issue is the imbalance between the processing industry and the energy industry. Currently, the capacity of power-consuming equipment in China has grown exponentially faster than the capacity of power generation. The processing industry should grow according to the capacity of energy supply. Many places, in order to increase industrial output value, put pressure on power plants to generate more electricity, sometimes against the laws of nature. The power grid is an independent economic entity with its own accounts and should generate power according to the plan. In the future, various levels of government should only support the power grid and not interfere with its normal production operations.

How should we view the current energy shortage? Li Peng said that it is not entirely correct to say that the energy industry is holding back the development of the national economy. In recent years, China's economic development speed has been too high. The current rectification and adjustment aim to appropriately reduce the economic development speed. The national economic development speed should be maintained between 7% and 8%, which can ensure doubling the economy by the end of the century. The energy industry should develop according to this speed; otherwise, it will exceed our national strength. The country and various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions should formulate plans based on this principle.

Li Peng pointed out that in the future, the energy industry should focus on both development and conservation, with development and conservation being equally important. This policy should be implemented for the long term.

Li Peng said that our energy consumption indicators are far behind those of advanced countries, which indicates waste and potential for improvement. In the future, energy conservation should be included in enterprise contract indicators, emphasizing technological transformation for energy conservation, and fostering a culture of energy conservation in society. Energy conservation should focus on key areas. Currently, there are 400,000 small boilers nationwide, burning 300 million tons of coal annually. These small boilers should be transformed into combined heat and power and centralized heating to save coal and reduce pollution.

When discussing how to develop the energy industry, Li Peng said that the coal industry will continue to follow the two-pronged approach of developing state-owned mines and supporting local small and medium-sized mines. Although small mines have encountered many problems during their development, we should not abandon them but rather improve and legalize the development policies and further support the development of small mines. However, those that severely damage resources and harm the interests of workers should be firmly shut down. The petroleum industry should maintain and strive to exceed the annual growth rate of 300 million tons, mainly relying on the increase in reserves and production in eastern oil fields. Nuclear power will remain in the preparatory stage for this century, with efforts to build two major nuclear power plants and ensure the quality of nuclear power construction.

Li Peng said that the main measures for rectification and adjustment are to reduce the scale of basic construction, and we must firmly reduce what needs to be reduced. This year, the energy industry should also strive to do its best within the existing plan. He urged everyone to see the situation clearly, work hard, share the difficulties, and do a good job in the rectification and adjustment work.

　　李鹏听取有关会议汇报时指出    
    能源工业要开发与节约并重
    本报北京１月２３日讯  新华社记者赵明亮、本报记者刘燮阳报道：国务院总理李鹏今天在中南海听取全国能源工作会议情况汇报时指出：我国能源发展战略应是开发与节约并重，保持能源工业稳定发展。
    姚依林、邹家华等同志也出席了今天的会议。
    李鹏总理在听取了能源部长黄毅诚关于当前能源形势及能源工业发展计划的汇报后说，能源工业近几年来成绩很大，尤其是电力建设去年装机容量达到１０００万千瓦，这在世界上也是可观的。能源工业的成就支持了改革、开放和全国的经济建设，同时改革开放也为能源工业带来了生机。近年来石油工业实行全行业大包干；煤炭行业采取大、中、小并举的方针，统配煤矿也实行了大包干；煤炭供应则实行产运销一本帐的办法；电力建设方面实行了集资办电，并正在进行电力管理体制改革，这些改革措施有力地促进了能源工业的发展。
    李鹏说，当前能源紧张的原因很复杂，煤矿、铁路、电厂都有问题，但主要矛盾还是铁路运输能力不足。
    李鹏指出，晋煤外运必须实行一本帐，不管计划内还是计划外的煤炭，都要纳入国家运输计划。这样不仅能够供应各方面用煤，而且可以消除以车皮谋私的弊端。
    李鹏总理特别指出，现在根本的问题是加工工业与能源工业的比例失调，目前我国用电设备容量增长已成倍地超过发电容量的增长。加工工业应根据能源供应能力增长。许多地方为了增加工业产值，给电厂施加压力，要求多发电，有时是违背规律的。电网是独立核算的经济实体，应按计划发电，以后各级政府只能支持电网，而不要干预电网的正常生产业务。
    怎么看待当前能源紧张状况？李鹏说，说能源工业拖了国民经济发展的后腿并不完全正确。近年来，我国经济发展速度过高。当前治理整顿，就是要适当降低经济发展速度。国民经济发展速度应保持在７％至８％之间，这个速度可以保证本世纪末翻两番。能源工业应根据这个速度发展，否则就超过了我们的国力，国家和各省、市、自治区应根据这个原则制定规划。
    李鹏指出，今后对于能源工业要一手抓开发，一手抓节约，发展与节约并重，这个方针长期应贯彻下去。
    李鹏说，我们的能耗指标与先进国家相比差距太大，这是浪费，也是潜力所在。今后应把节能列入企业承包指标，注重节能的技术改造，在社会上形成节能风气。节能应抓住重点。目前全国有４０万台小锅炉，每年烧煤３亿吨。应以热电联产、集中供热等方式对小锅炉进行改造，这样既可省煤，又可减少污染。
    李鹏在谈到如何发展能源工业时说，煤炭工业今后仍坚持两条腿走路，一方面发展统配煤矿，一方面也要支持地方中小煤矿生产。中小煤矿在发展过程中出现不少问题，但不能因噎废食，而是要把发展政策加以完善，法制化，进一步扶持小煤矿发展。但对严重破坏资源、损害劳动者利益的要坚决予以取缔。石油工业要保持并力争超过年增长３００万吨的速度，主要依靠东部油田增储上产。核电工业在本世纪内还是准备期，努力建好两大核电厂，确保核电建设质量。
    李鹏同志最后说，治理整顿的主要措施是压缩基本建设规模，必须坚决把该压的压下来。今年能源工业也要在现有计划盘子内尽量努力搞好。他要求大家看清形势，努力工作，共担困难，把治理整顿工作搞好。
