Iraq has decided to release 255 more Iranian prisoners of war.

The Iraqi News Agency reported that Iraq has decided to release 255 more Iranian prisoners of war. The report said that the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs has notified the International Committee of the Red Cross of this decision to facilitate the withdrawal of these prisoners of war.

Last week, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, while meeting with representatives attending the Islamic Affairs Supreme Council, expressed his intention to release more Iranian prisoners of war.

In a memorandum, the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs urged the International Committee of the Red Cross and the international community to persuade Iran to release all Iraqi prisoners of war.

According to figures provided by the International Committee of the Red Cross, Iran and Iraq are each holding approximately 50,000 and 30,000 prisoners of war, respectively.

Since the two countries began exchanging prisoners of war, Iraq has released 670 Iranian prisoners of war, and Iran has released 800 Iraqi prisoners of war through the International Committee of the Red Cross.
