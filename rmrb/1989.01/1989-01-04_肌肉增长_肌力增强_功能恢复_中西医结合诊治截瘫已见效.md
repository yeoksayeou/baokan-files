	Combined Chinese and Western Medicine Treatment for Spinal Cord Injury Shows Effectiveness

	Xinhua News Agency, Shijiazhuang, January 3 — (Reporter Peng Zhankui) Dr. Li Peijang from the Tangshan Massage Research Institute has achieved breakthrough results in treating spinal cord injury. His use of massage as the primary method for treating spinal cord injury has attracted the attention of domestic and international experts.

	The 33-year-old Dr. Li Peijang has mastered a set of inherited massage techniques. While treating conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, hemiplegia, fractures, and bone hyperplasia, he has also developed a set of diagnostic techniques and treatment methods for spinal cord injury that combine Chinese and Western medicine. Spinal cord injury generally falls into two categories: traumatic and non-traumatic. In his practice, Li Peijang has discovered a third type: secondary complete and incomplete spinal cord injury. He applies a new set of diagnostic and treatment methods for spinal cord injury, including massage anesthesia, relaxation of tendons, separation and stretching, pressing and rotating, and tapping and shaking. Over the past year, 16 patients who have undergone treatment have shown significant improvements. These patients had been suffering from 1 to 9 years, but after undergoing qigong massage treatment, their muscle growth, strength, sensation, joint movement, and other functions have recovered. Their bowel and bladder functions have returned to normal, and their spinal cord injury index has improved from 5 to 6 to 1 to 2.

	While conducting clinical research, Dr. Li Peijang has also written more than 10 papers. Two of these have been included in the first collection of international traditional Chinese medicine papers and the second collection of international disability studies conference papers.

　　肌肉增长　肌力增强　功能恢复
    中西医结合诊治截瘫已见效
    新华社石家庄１月３日电  （记者彭占魁）唐山市按摩研究所李培刚大夫治疗截瘫症取得突破性效果。他以按摩作为治疗截瘫的主导性方法，引起了国内外有关专家的重视。
    ３３岁的李培刚大夫掌握了一套祖传按摩技术。他在治疗类风湿、偏瘫、骨折、骨质增生等病的同时，还对截瘫症总结出一套中西医结合的诊断技术和治疗方法。截瘫一般分为外伤性和病理性截瘫两种，李培刚在实践中又发现一种继发型完全和不完全截瘫。他应用按摩麻醉、缓解疏筋、拨离伸展、按跷转动、敲打震颤等一套辨证治疗截瘫的新方法，一年多来，已经接受治疗的１６位病人都取得显著效果。这些患者病程１至９年，经他气功按摩治疗后，肌肉增长，肌力增强，感觉、关节运动等功能恢复，大小便正常，截瘫指数由５至６恢复到１至２。
    李培刚大夫在进行临床实践研究的同时，还撰写了１０余篇论文，其中两篇分别被编入首届中医药国际论文集和第二届国际残疾人学术会议论文集。
