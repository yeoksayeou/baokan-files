The West China Railway Bureau, one of the earliest to implement the "Bureau Chief Responsibility System," has 70,000 employees and manages 1,330 kilometers of operational lines. In August 1984, the wave of reform propelled the 39-year-old Gong Deshun to the position of Bureau Chief of the West China Railway. "He had never even held a deputy position before, now he's leading a large enterprise. Can he handle this heavy responsibility?" The questioners had their reasons.

		Focusing on People

Since taking office, Gong Deshun has led the West China Railway Bureau to exceed transportation plans year after year in the face of increasing conflicts between transportation capacity and volume. The bureau once set a new record of 1,580 days of safe operation, and economic benefits have significantly improved. He himself has been awarded the title of "Labor Model" by the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau and "Excellent Director" by the Shaanxi Provincial Government, and had the honor of attending the 13th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. Many of his peers envy him, calling him a "reformer," while outsiders comment that he is "bold and daring, but never oversteps, like a train always running on the rails."

What is the secret to Gong Deshun's success? The reporter carefully observed and followed his path to success, discovering that as an entrepreneur, he has many achievements, but his most prominent strength is his ability to understand, respect, believe in, cultivate, care for, and cherish people. Through these efforts, he nurtures the spirit of the enterprise. As Gong Deshun himself said, "The revitalization of an enterprise is like a train in motion, relying on two wheels running in sync: one is enterprise management, the other is technological progress. The axis connecting these two wheels is people. People are the most active factor in production. Only by liberating people can we liberate productivity."

		Breaking Down the Invisible Wall

After graduating from the Railway Engineering University, Gong Deshun worked for a long time in the basic stations and sections. He noticed that workers could say whatever they wanted among themselves, but when officials came, they often fell silent. He couldn't understand it. But now, the title of Bureau Chief is on his own nameplate. What should he do? He decided to break down the invisible wall between "officials" and "citizens." In the first month of taking office, facing years of accumulated cases and a large number of employee visits, he solemnly announced that the 14th of every month would be "Bureau Chief Reception Day." At the same time, he established a "Bureau Chief Hotline" and a "Bureau Chief Mailbox." Anyone with grievances, difficulties, opinions, or reasonable suggestions could directly communicate with him or report to him. This move was praised by the employees as the "Bureau Chief's Three Hotlines." Over the years, he has received 2,000 employee visits and handled 2,000 letters, resolving 186 historical cases, creating a harmonious atmosphere throughout the bureau.

Taking this as a starting point, Gong Deshun advocated for the implementation of the "Reception Day for Leaders at All Levels" system throughout the bureau, and established the "Employee Representative Reception Day" system, the "Employee Representative Rotation Research" system, the "Democratic Consultation Meeting" and "Democratic Inquiry Meeting" systems, and other mechanisms. He explored a new path for ensuring that employees participate in enterprise management and supervision in the new situation, ensuring the scientific and democratic nature of enterprise management decisions. He believes that democratic management in an enterprise is not just for show, but to reflect the status of employees as masters of the enterprise and to maximize their creativity.

		The "Reward Return" Wins Hearts

After careful investigation, Gong Deshun felt that the previous method of "punishment instead of education" for safety production was more harmful than beneficial and not feasible. A more effective method is the big "human" character in his heart. The key is to enhance the sense of responsibility among all employees. Therefore, he advocated that the West China Railway Bureau make a decision when safety production broke through 500 days: "All penalties imposed on employees for unsafe accidents before this time will be canceled, and everything will start anew." A few months later, he proposed the reward return system: Each station and section will, at the end of each quarter, evaluate employees who were economically penalized for violations in the previous quarter. Those who have shown significant improvement can have part of their deducted bonuses returned; those who have shown exceptional performance or have made significant contributions can have all their bonuses returned; those who have committed violations but have voluntarily reported and corrected them can be exempted from economic penalties and administrative sanctions. Of course, those who cause serious accidents will be severely punished, even to the point of being expelled from the railway.

Railway safety is a matter of life and death. After Gong Deshun proposed the reward return system, many who believed in the omnipotence of punishment worried: Without the fear of punishment, can the employees' sense of responsibility be relied upon? The facts gave an affirmative answer. After the announcement of the reward return system, Gong Deshun organized and mobilized each station and section to use real cases as teaching materials and carried out in-depth safety production education activities, achieving unexpected results. In June 1987, the West China Railway Bureau was the first among the six bureaus of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau to achieve 1,500 days of safe operation, entering the ranks of the best in the country, and was commended by the Ministry of Railways.

The "safety amnesty" and "reward return system" removed the spiritual shackles from the 1/5 of employees who had been penalized. Those who initially criticized this move also had to admit that it mobilized the employees' awareness of executing railway transportation regulations. When talking about this "proud achievement," Director Gong told the reporter a philosophical speech. He said, "Our tens of thousands of employees are first and foremost people, living, thinking, and feeling people. Only by treating people as complete individuals, giving them the understanding and respect they deserve, rather than treating them as machines or objects, can people's thoughts be liberated. They will not be oppressed by others, nor will they oppress others, truly becoming masters. Only then can we talk about freedom of will. And with the freedom of will, there is liberation of people and liberation of productivity. We have fundamentally done the work of liberating productivity, and people's creativity and talents are fully brought into play, resulting in good drivers, good inspectors, and a good workforce."

		The Foundation of Work is at the Grassroots

The railway department is different from general factories and mines. It does not produce products, but its main function is to quickly realize the transfer of goods and passengers. Gong Deshun often says that society's requirements for the railway are eight words: safe and on time, smooth and unobstructed. To achieve this, sitting in the office all day "remote controlling" is not enough. The characteristics of the railway are that it is always moving every second of every day. Even if tens of thousands of people work well, if one person operates improperly, an accident will occur. Therefore, prevention is better than cure.

These principles are well understood by everyone, but putting them into practice is not so easy. Since taking office, the energetic Director Gong has spent 1/3 of his time each year in the grassroots. He dislikes the formalities of welcoming and sending off guests and has no interest in the mountains of documents and meetings. The reporter saw that in the bureau chief's office, there is a travel bag containing biscuits, ready to leave at any time. In just a few years, almost every station and section in the bureau has left traces of his on-site office work. To solve the problem of relocating and rebuilding the children's school in the Luoyang section of the Baocheng Line, which is located deep in the Qinling Mountains, he has "visited Luoyang three times" since last year, inspecting the quality of the project, helping to solve the problem of insufficient funds, and only being satisfied when the children started school in the new building on September 1, 1988.

Xi'an East Station is a large marshalling station on the national railway trunk line, with a designed capacity of handling 4,100 cars per day. A few years ago, due to internal disputes among various departments of the railway, the number of cars handled per day was only around 3,600, often causing "bottleneck" phenomena. Gong Deshun conducted multiple on-site inspections and proposed a package responsibility system through joint production, joint responsibility, and joint benefits, integrating various departments into a unified assessment, and reforming the distribution system. As a result, the number of cars handled per day increased by 43.9% compared to the original, exceeding the designed capacity. The Xi'an East Station, which used to easily have congestion problems, has since become smooth and unobstructed.

Recently, during the rectification of the economic order, Director Gong, disguised as an ordinary passenger, visited the Xi'an advance ticket window multiple times for "undercover inspections." He then organized forces to crack down on "ticket tyrants" and "ticket scalpers." He announced through local media to the whole society: "From now on, anyone found to have colluded with outsiders to sell railway tickets will be expelled from the railway!" He strictly manages the railway, and after the title of "commoner director," he has also won the title of "iron director."

　　心中有个大写的“人”字
    ——记西安铁路分局局长巩德顺
    本报记者  景险峰
    全国铁路系统实行“分局长负责制”较早的西安铁路分局，拥有７万名职工，管辖着１３３０公里的运营线路。１９８４年８月初，改革的大潮将３９岁的巩德顺推上了西铁分局局长的岗位。“他过去连副职都未干过，如今充当大型企业第一管理者，这副重担挑得起吗？”提问者自有道理。
    　　　　在“人”上做文章
    巩德顺任职以来，在铁路运能和运量矛盾日趋加剧的形势下，西铁分局连年超额完成运输计划，安全生产曾创１５８０天的新纪录，经济效益大幅度提高。他本人呢，先后被郑州铁路局评为“劳动模范”，被陕西省政府命名为“优秀厂长”，还荣幸地出席了党的十三大。不少同龄人以羡慕的口吻称他为“改革的弄潮儿”，局外人议论他“敢开拓，有魄力，但从来不越轨，就像列车总是沿着双轨前进”。
    巩德顺成功的奥妙何在？记者留心观察并追踪他获得成功的轨迹，发现他作为一个企业家实绩不少，但最显著的长处是，能够并善于理解人，尊重人，相信人，培养人，关心人，爱护人。通过这些，造人之魂，培育企业精神。这正如巩德顺所说：“企业振兴就像列车奔驰，要靠两个轮子同步运行，一个是企业管理，一个是技术进步，而连结这两个轮子的轴则是人。人是生产力中最活跃的因素，只有解放了人，才能解放生产力。”
    　　　　拆掉无形的墙
    巩德顺从铁道学院毕业后，长期在基层站段工作。他注意到，工人们在一块有啥说啥，可干部一来，常变得鸦雀无声，他有些想不通。可分局长的头衔，如今挂在自己身上，怎么办呢？他决心拆掉“官”与“民”之间这堵无形的墙。上任的当月，面对多年积案和大量职工来访，他郑重宣布每月１４日为“分局长接待日”。同时，设立了“分局长专线电话”和“分局长信箱”。谁有冤假错案，谁有困难和意见，谁有合理化建议等，都可和他直接对话或向他反映。此举，被职工们誉为“分局长的三条热线”。几年来，他接待职工来访２０００多人次，处理职工来信２０００多封，解决历史积案１８６件，使全分局上下出现“政通人和”的局面。
    以此为开端，巩德顺又倡导在全分局实行各级领导干部接待日制度，并建立了职工代表接待日制度，职工代表轮流脱产调查研究制度，民主恳谈会和民主质询会制度等，探索一条新形势下保障职工参政议政，参与企业经营管理，监督企业各级领导的新路子，以保证企业经营决策的科学化和民主化。他认为，企业的民主管理决不是图形式，而在于体现出职工在企业中的主人翁地位，最大限度地调动他们的创造性。
    　　　　“返奖”得人心
    经过仔细调查了解，巩德顺觉得在安全生产问题上，过去那种单纯“以罚代教”的方法弊大利小，很不可取。更有效的办法，仍是他心中那个大写的“人”字，关键在于提高全体职工的主人翁责任心。于是，他力主西铁分局在安全生产突破５００天时作出决定：“凡在此前，职工因不安全事故而受到的处罚，一律取消，一切从头开始”。几个月后，他又提出了返奖制度；由各站段在每个季度末，对上个季度中因违章操作发生事故而受到经济处罚的职工，定期进行鉴定。对确实表现好的可部分返回被扣奖金；对表现特别突出的或立功者，可全部返奖；对发生违章违纪但本人能主动上报并认真改正的，可免于经济处罚和行政处分。当然，造成严重事故者，重罚重处以至开除路籍也决不手软。
    铁路安全事关人命，巩德顺提出返奖制度后，许多笃信处罚万能的人担心：失却对处罚的畏惧害怕心理，职工的“主人翁精神”靠得住么？事实作了肯定的回答。返奖制度宣布后，巩德顺组织发动各站段以实例为教材，开展了扎实的安全生产教育活动，收到出乎意料的效果。前年６月１０日，西铁分局在郑州铁路局６个分局中，首先实现了安全生产１５００天，跨入全路先进行列，受到铁道部的表彰。
    “安全特赦”和“返奖制度”，解除了套在占职工总数１／５受罚者身上的精神枷锁。那些当初说三道四的“评判员”，也不得不承认此举调动了职工执行铁路运输规章制度的自觉性。谈到这一“得意之作”，巩局长向记者发了一通富于哲理的宏论。他说：“我们数万名职工，首先是人，活生生的、有思想感情的人。其次，才是火车司机、列检员、乘务员，等等。只有把人视为完整的人格，给予应有的理解和尊重，而不是把人当作机器或物体来处置，人的思想解放了，不受人压制，也不压制人，真正成了主人，这才谈得上意志上的自由。而有了意志上的自由，才有人的解放，生产力的解放。我们从根本上做好了解放生产力的工作，人的创造和才能充分发挥出来了，就会有好的司机，好的列检员，好的职工队伍。”
    　　　　基层是工作的基点
    铁路部门不同于一般厂矿企业，它不制造产品，主要功能在于迅速实现货物和旅客的位移。巩德顺常说，社会对铁路的要求只有八个字：安全正点，畅通无阻。要做到这一点，成天坐在办公室里“遥控”是不行的。铁路的特点，每时每刻每天每秒都在动。成千上万人干得再好，哪怕一个人违章操作就要出事故。因此，必须防患于未然。
    这些道理谁都明白，但要身体力行却不那么容易。任职以来，年富力强的巩局长，每年有１／３的时间泡在基层。他讨厌送往迎来，无心于文山会海。记者看到，局长办公室里，备有一个旅行袋，里面装着饼干，遇事说走就走。短短几年，全分局上百个站段，几乎都留下了他现场办公的足迹。为解决地处秦岭深处的宝成线洛阳区段子弟小学的搬迁重建，前年以来他“三下洛阳”，检查工程质量，帮助解决资金不足，直到去年９月１日职工子弟在新校上学他才满意。
    西安东站是全国铁路干线的一个大型编组站，设计能力日均办理车数为４１００辆。前几年，由于铁路内部各部门互相扯皮，日均办理车数仅３６００多辆，经常出现“卡脖子”现象。巩德顺多次到现场考察，提出通过联产、联责、联利的包干办法，将各部门组成一个整体考核，并对分配制度进行了改革。结果，使其日均办理车数比原来提高４３．９％，超过了设计能力。昔日容易出现堵塞现象的西安东站，从此变得畅通无阻。
    最近，在整顿经济秩序中，巩局长以普通旅客的身份多次到西安预售票窗口“微服私访”，接着组织力量打击“票霸”和“票贩子”。他通过当地新闻媒介向全社会宣布：“今后凡是发现铁路职工有内外勾结倒卖车票的，一律开除路籍！”他从严治路，在“平民局长”的称号之后，又赢得了“铁局长”的美誉。
