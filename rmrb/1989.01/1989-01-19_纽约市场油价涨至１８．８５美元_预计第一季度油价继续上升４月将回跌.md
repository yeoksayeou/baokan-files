Oil prices in the New York market have risen to $18.85 per barrel.

It is predicted that oil prices will continue to rise in the first quarter of this year and may fall back in April.

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, January 17th: The price of crude oil futures has risen to its highest level since November 20, 1987.

In the New York market, the price of February contracts for West Texas Intermediate crude oil has risen to $18.85 per barrel. Since October 5, 1988, the contract price of this type of crude oil has risen by 50%. At that time, the monthly contract price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil was $12.28 per barrel.

Some oil industry analysts believe that crude oil prices may rise to $19 to $19.50 per barrel in the first quarter of this year because the production-cutting and price-maintaining agreement of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) will be implemented.

However, they believe that by April of this year, oil prices may fall back to $17 per barrel because, from that time on, the demand for oil will start to decrease as usual.

　　纽约市场油价涨至１８．８５美元
    预计第一季度油价继续上升４月将回跌
    新华社华盛顿１月１７日电  石油期货价格１６日上升到１９８７年１１月２０日以来的最高水平。
    在纽约市场上，美国西得克萨斯中质油的２月份合同价已上升到１８．８５美元１桶。自１９８８年１０月５日以来，这种原油的合同价格已上涨５０％。当时，西得克萨斯中质油的月合同价格为每桶１２．２８美元。
    一些石油工业分析家认为，原油价格今年第一季度内可升到每桶１９美元至１９．５美元，因为石油输出国组织的限产保价协议将能得到实施。
    但是，他们认为，今年４月份，石油价格可能回降到１７美元１桶，因为自那时起，对石油的需求将像往常一样开始减少。
