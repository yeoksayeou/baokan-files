The Hailar Railway Bureau has been working to improve the conditions of its middle and primary schools. By the end of last November, all 33 teaching points in the bureau had been closed, and more than 1,000 students from small stations along the line had been enrolled in regular schools. The remote railway lines have thus ended a history of more than 20 years of relying on teaching points for education.

Most of the sections of this bureau are located in remote forest and grassland areas, with long lines and many stations, and harsh environments. For many years, school-age children along the line, far from urban areas and major stations, have been studying at teaching points set up in train stations or maintenance workshops. Due to the limitations of the teaching conditions and the level of teachers, teaching points with as many as a dozen or as few as two or three students could only offer main subjects such as language and arithmetic. Courses like art, music, and physical education could not be offered at all. Before 1986, the qualification rate for primary school graduates along the line was only 40%.

In early 1986, the bureau decided to change the backward state of middle and primary school education within three years. They formulated a plan of "one year to lay the foundation, two years to catch up, and three years to create excellence" based on the actual situation within the jurisdiction. Over the past three years, education funding has increased year by year, with a total investment of 433.8 million yuan. They have successively built five boarding schools, including Donghai Railway Primary School and Mianuduhe Railway Primary School, and a high school experimental base, with a total construction area of more than 11,000 square meters. New school buildings account for 30% of the total number of schools. At the same time, they expanded and renovated existing school buildings and added and updated a large number of books and teaching equipment.

Currently, all eight middle schools within the jurisdiction have built advanced standardized physics, chemistry, and biology laboratories, and a computer room with 20 microcomputers. Most schools have student dormitories, and students from small stations along the line can all live on campus to study. Since 1987, the primary school enrollment rate has reached 99.8%, and primary schools have achieved centralized education. Key high schools recruit students from the entire bureau.

　　线长点多　铁路子弟上学困难
    集中办学　海拉尔局教育改观
    本报讯  海拉尔铁路分局努力改善中、小学办学条件。到去年１１月底，全分局３３个教学点全部撤除，１０００余名沿线小站的中、小学生进入正规学校就读。偏僻的铁路沿线从此结束了长达２０多年靠教学点办学的历史。
    这个分局的多数区段地处偏僻的林区和草原，线长点多，环境艰苦。多年来，远离市区、大站的沿线小站，适龄儿童一直是在车站或养路工区设置的教学点上学。由于受办学条件和师资水平的限制，多则十几名、少则两三名学生的教学点，除开设语文、算术等主课外，美术、音乐、体育等课程根本无法开设。１９８６年以前，沿线小学毕业生合格率仅达４０％。
    １９８６年初，这个分局下决心三年内改变中、小学教育的落后面貌。他们根据管内的实际情况，制订出“一年打基础，二年争上游，三年创一流”的规划。三年来，教育经费连年递增，投资总额达４３３．８万元，先后新建了东海拉尔铁路小学、免渡河铁路小学等五所住宿学校和一个高中实验基地，建筑面积达１１０００余平方米，新建校舍占学校总数的３０％。同时，对原有校舍进行了扩建、改建，并添置、更新了大量图书和教学设备。
    目前，管内８所中学全部建起了先进的标准化理化生物实验室，还建起了一个拥有２０台微机的电脑室。多数学校设有学生宿舍，沿线小站的学生全部可以住校学习。１９８７年以来，小学入学率达到９９．８％，并实现小学集中办学，重点高中面向全分局招生。
