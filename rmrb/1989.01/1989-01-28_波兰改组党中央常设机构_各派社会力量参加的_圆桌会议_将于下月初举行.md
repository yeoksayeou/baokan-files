	Poland Reorganizes Party Central Standing Committees

	Round Table Conference with Various Social Forces to be Held Next Month

	New China News Agency Warsaw, January 26 (Reporter Dong Fusheng) To adapt to the new situation of reform, the Polish United Workers' Party is establishing 15 committees to replace the current central departments and will streamline the staff.

	According to a report in the Polish newspaper on the 26th, the newly established 15 committees are either functional or set up to complete specific tasks. Each committee is led by a Politburo member, alternate member, or Central Committee secretary. The members are Central Committee members or invited party activists. The final personnel composition will be decided by the Eleventh Plenum.

	Of the original central departments, only the Central Office, the Party Financial Department, and the Personnel Policy Department will be retained, while the rest will be abolished. The staff of the various departments will either be transferred to the subordinate agencies of the committees or to other party organs.

	It is reported that the reform of the organizational structure of the Polish Party Central Committee will reduce the number of central staff by 45%.

	New China News Agency Warsaw, January 26 (Reporter Tang Deqiao) The Round Table Conference, attended by representatives of various social forces in Poland, including representatives of the constructive opposition, will be held around February 5.

	This was revealed by Polish Foreign Ministry spokesman Stanislawski at a press conference today.

	He said that Poland's foreign policy will not be discussed at the Round Table Conference. The main topics of the conference are "some issues related to national reconciliation." He pointed out that he, like all Poles, hopes that this important conference will be "successful" to promote the improvement of the domestic situation in Poland and to deepen political and economic reforms.

	The convening of the Round Table Conference was proposed by the Polish authorities in August 1988 after the failure of the price-income action and the outbreak of two waves of strikes. The purpose of this initiative is to seek consensus and joint action with the authorities on major issues among people of all social strata to promote the construction and reform of socialism.

　　波兰改组党中央常设机构    
    各派社会力量参加的“圆桌会议”将于下月初举行
    新华社华沙１月２６日电（记者董福生）为适应改革的新形势，波兰统一工人党正组建１５个委员会以代替目前的中央各部，并将精简工作人员。
    据波兰报纸２６日报道，新组建的１５个委员会或者具有职能性，或者专为完成某项任务而设立。每个委员会都由政治局委员、候补委员或者中央书记牵头。成员则由中央委员或者特邀的党的活动家担任。最终的人员构成将由十一中全会决定。
    原有的中央各部，除中央办公厅、党内财务部和干部政策部这三个部门仍然保留外，其余一律取消。各部原有的工作人员，部分转入各委员会下设机构工作外，其余转入党的其他机关。
    据介绍，波党中央组织结构的改革将使中央的工作人员减少４５％。
    新华社华沙１月２６日电　（记者汤德乔）波兰各社会力量代表，其中包括建设性反对派代表参加的“圆桌会议”将于２月５日左右举行。
    这是波兰外交部发言人斯塔尼舍夫斯基今天在记者招待会上透露的。
    他说，波兰外交政策将不会在“圆桌会议”上讨论，会议的主要议题是“有关民族谅解的一些问题”。他指出，他和所有波兰人一样希望这次重要的会议“圆满成功”，以推动波兰国内形势的改善，促进政治和经济改革的深入。
    召开“圆桌会议”是波兰当局在价格—收入行动失败后国内两度爆发工潮的情况下于１９８８年８月提出的。这一倡议的目的在于争取社会各阶层人民在重大问题上与当局取得一致意见，共同行动，以推进社会主义的建设和改革事业。
