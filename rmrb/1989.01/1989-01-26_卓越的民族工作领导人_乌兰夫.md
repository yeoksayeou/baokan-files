Comrade Ulanfu has left us, but his noble character, lofty virtues, and excellent work style will forever remain in our hearts.

Over half a century of revolutionary and practical experience has shown that Comrade Ulanfu is indeed a loyal communist warrior of ethnic minority origin, a great patriot. Throughout his life, he dedicated himself to serving the people of all ethnic groups in China, always upholding unity, opposing secession, adhering to the truth, and creatively implementing the Party's ethnic policies. He is an outstanding leader in this regard.

As early as his youth, he embraced progressive ideas and resolved to transform the impoverished and backward old China, actively participating in the anti-imperialist patriotic movement. Under the care and help of famous communists such as Li Dazhao, Deng Zhongxia, and Zhao Shiyuan, he studied Marxism-Leninism diligently and became an early member of the Chinese Communist Party. Together with other ethnic minority revolutionary pioneers like Deng Enming, Ma Jun, Guo Longzhen, Han Leyan, and Wei Bagu, he, as an outstanding representative of the ethnic minorities, was one of the first to realize that only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party could the various ethnic groups in China achieve equality, unity, and liberation. From then on, in every development period and major turning point of China's ethnic liberation and ethnic unity and progress, one could see Ulanfu's giant figure and his indelible contributions.

In July 1929, Comrade Ulanfu was sent by the Party organization to the Ximeng region, braving the white terror to engage in mass work, Party affairs, military work, and united front work under harsh conditions. He participated in leading the anti-Japanese struggle in the Inner Mongolia region, initiating the famous "Bailingsi Uprising," organizing the largest anti-Japanese armed force among the Mongols at that time, and personally commanding the battle to defend Guihua. In the midst of the Chinese nation's crisis, he fully demonstrated the revolutionary spirit of communists who fight tenaciously and fear no sacrifice, making important contributions to the armed struggle of the various ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia against Japan.

After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, when China was at a crossroads of two destinies and two futures, a fierce struggle emerged in the Inner Mongolia region over whether to secede from the country or maintain unity. At that time, the separatist elements led by Buyingdala held a so-called "Inner Mongolia People's Representative Conference" in Sunite Right Banner, establishing a so-called "Provisional Government of the Inner Mongolia Republic," attempting to secede Inner Mongolia from the motherland. To thwart their separatist plot, in October 1945, Comrade Ulanfu was dispatched by the Party Central Committee to do work among various strata, propagate the Party's ethnic policies, unite the broad masses, and expose the separatist plot of Buyingdala and others face to face, forcing them to dissolve the "provisional government." Comrade Zhou Enlai praised his action as "going alone to the meeting" and gave full affirmation and praise. In March 1946, according to the instructions of the Central Committee, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Movement Union and the East Mongolia Autonomous Government held a unified conference on the autonomous movement in Chengde. At the preparatory meeting, there were two diametrically opposed views on the future direction and leadership of the autonomous movement: whether to achieve ethnic regional autonomy within the family of the motherland or to pursue "independent autonomy"; whether to accept the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party or to replace it with the Inner Mongolia People's Revolutionary Party. At this critical moment that decided the fate of the Mongolian people, Comrade Ulanfu firmly pointed out: the Inner Mongolia autonomous movement could only be part of the Chinese people's democratic revolution under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party; the correct path for the autonomous movement was to accept the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, fully mobilize the masses, and achieve unified ethnic regional autonomy in Inner Mongolia; only the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Movement Union could be the unified leadership body for the autonomous movement. At the meeting, Comrade Ulanfu combined revolutionary firmness with strategic flexibility, both insisting on struggle and paying attention to full consultation, finally uniting and winning over most of the representatives, reaching a consensus. On April 3 of the same year, a formal meeting was held to discuss and adopt the "Main Resolutions of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Movement Unified Conference," and Comrade Ulanfu was elected as the chairman of the executive committee and the standing committee, as well as the minister of military affairs. The "April 3" conference is of great significance in the history of the Mongolian nation and the revolution in Inner Mongolia. It not only ended the long-term division of the eastern and western parts of Inner Mongolia but also laid the political foundation for the Mongolian nation to implement ethnic regional autonomy within the unified family of the motherland.

Our Party, through long-term exploration, found the correct path of solving domestic ethnic issues through implementing ethnic regional autonomy. Comrade Ulanfu is the bravest pioneer on this glorious path. On April 3, 1947, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Movement Union held the Inner Mongolia People's Representative Conference. In his political report, Comrade Ulanfu summarized the historical experience of the Inner Mongolia autonomous movement and drew the important conclusion that the conditions for establishing the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government had matured. The conference decided to establish the autonomous government, elected the provisional council, and elected Comrade Ulanfu as the chairman of the autonomous government. On May 1, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government was officially established, and Chairman Mao Zedong and General Zhu De sent special congratulatory telegrams. From then on, the first ethnic autonomous region was born on the land of China, playing a major role in creating successful experiences in implementing the ethnic regional autonomy system.

Comrade Ulanfu served as the first secretary of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Party Committee, chairman of the Autonomous Region People's Committee, commander and political commissar of the Inner Mongolia Military Region, and chairman of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Political Consultative Conference. In nearly 20 years of leading the work in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, he creatively implemented the Party's ethnic regional autonomy policies and various other policies, uniting and leading the Mongolian and Han people of the entire region to achieve great victories in socialist revolution and construction, building the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region into a model autonomous region, and setting an example for all ethnic autonomous regions in the country.

After the founding of New China, Comrade Ulanfu served as a member of the Central People's Government, secretary and deputy director of the Party group of the Central Nationalities Affairs Commission, vice premier of the State Council, director of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and vice chairman of the state. In participating in the leadership of the Party and the state, he firmly adhered to the Marxist line on ethnic work and continuously promoted the cause of national unity and progress.

In 1956, at the Eighth National Congress of the Party, Comrade Ulanfu made a speech in which he deeply summarized the historical experience of carrying out social reforms in ethnic minority areas. He pointed out that in pastoral areas, democratic reforms and socialist transformations could be carried out peacefully. He criticized the erroneous tendency of not paying attention to ethnic differences and mechanically copying methods from Han or other ethnic regions, pointing out that the reform of ethnic minorities should correctly reflect the special circumstances and actual needs of each ethnic group.

In 1957, at the Qingdao Ethnic Work Symposium, Comrade Ulanfu made an important speech following the suggestion of Comrade Zhou Enlai. He pointed out that ethnic minorities, after social reforms, would walk the path of socialism, changing everything that was not conducive to socialism and the development and progress of the ethnic group, rather than eliminating the ethnic group. On the contrary, the ethnic group should be developed, and each ethnic group should be developed into a nation with a high level of economy and culture. "In a socialist society, not only do ethnic groups exist, but they also prosper." He analyzed the necessity of China's implementation of ethnic regional autonomy and the establishment of a unified multi-ethnic state, pointing out that "fully realizing the autonomy rights of ethnic minorities is the main issue in implementing ethnic regional autonomy." He demanded further implementation of autonomy rights, formulation of relevant laws and regulations, and specific measures to enable ethnic minorities to truly govern themselves and manage their internal affairs. He also clearly proposed that "after the implementation of ethnic regional autonomy and socialist transformation, the overriding task within the autonomous regions is to carry out socialist construction."

In April 1962, Comrade Ulanfu made a long speech at the National Ethnic Work Conference, introducing the experience of implementing ethnic regional autonomy and economic construction in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. He reiterated the Party's effective ethnic policies and united front policies, expounding on the policies of ethnic equality, ethnic unity, ethnic regional autonomy, and ethnic development and prosperity. He refuted the erroneous view that "since we are all socialist now, all ethnic groups are the same, and it is outdated to talk about ethnic minorities governing themselves," emphasizing the importance and necessity of implementing ethnic regional autonomy. His report played an active role in correcting the "leftist" errors in ethnic work at that time.

In April 1979, Comrade Ulanfu made an important report at the National Border Defense Work Conference. Due to the serious interference of Lin Biao and the "Gang of Four" during the ten years of turmoil, ethnic work suffered great damage. It was important to re-educate on ethnic policies, check the implementation of ethnic policies, and solve existing problems. Comrade Ulanfu's report implemented the Party's thought of seeking truth from facts, systematically reaffirming and expounding the Party's correct ethnic policies and religious policies, especially emphasizing the importance of accelerating the economic and cultural construction of ethnic minority areas. He also proposed for the first time that the state should organize inland provinces and cities to implement paired assistance to border and ethnic minority areas. This report was circulated by the Central Committee nationwide, requiring various places to implement it in combination with actual conditions.

After becoming the vice chairman of the state, Comrade Ulanfu was busy with a multitude of affairs, but he still paid great attention to ethnic work and the reform cause in ethnic minority areas. On April 4, 1985, at a tea party for ethnic minority representatives and committee members attending the Third Session of the Sixth National People's Congress and the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Comrade Ulanfu delivered a speech, pointing out: "The reform in ethnic regions must start from reality and seek truth from facts, and cannot pursue a single model. It should creatively implement the central policies." The reform in ethnic minority areas should fully consider the characteristics of the region. "No matter how you reform, the standard is whether you have improved economic efficiency and whether you can develop productive forces."

Comrade Ulanfu, as an outstanding leader in ethnic work, has left a rich and precious spiritual legacy for future generations. We should learn from, inherit, and carry forward his spirit. The glorious image of Comrade Ulanfu will inspire us to forge ahead in ethnic work in the new era!

    卓越的民族工作领导人——乌兰夫
    司马义·艾买提
    乌兰夫同志离我们而去了，但他的高风亮节，崇高品德和优良作风，将永留我们心中。
    半个多世纪的革命和实践表明，乌兰夫同志不愧是少数民族出身的忠诚的共产主义战士、伟大的爱国主义者。他一生全心全意为中华各民族人民服务，始终维护统一，反对分裂，坚持团结，实事求是，是创造性地执行党的民族政策的卓越领导人。
    早在青少年时代，他就接受进步思想，立志改造贫穷落后的旧中国，积极投身于反帝爱国运动。在李大钊、邓中夏、赵世炎等著名共产党人的关怀、帮助下，他认真学习马克思列宁主义，成为中国共产党建党初期的党员。他与少数民族出身的革命先驱如邓恩铭、马骏、郭隆真、韩乐然、韦拔群等同志，作为少数民族人民的杰出代表，率先认识到：只有在中国共产党的领导下，中华各民族才能实现平等联合翻身求解放。从此，在我国民族解放和民族团结进步事业的每一个发展时期和重大转折关头，都可以看到乌兰夫同志巨人般的身影和他所建树的不可磨灭的功绩。
    1929年7月，乌兰夫同志受党组织派遣，不顾白色恐怖，奋不顾身地来到西蒙地区，从事群众、党务、军事和统一战线工作，在艰苦的条件下经受了严峻的考验。他参与领导内蒙古地区的抗日斗争，发动了著名的“百灵庙暴动”，组建了当时在蒙古族中最大的抗日武装，并亲自指挥了保卫归绥的战斗。在中华民族危难之中，他充分表现了共产党人顽强奋斗、不怕牺牲的革命精神，为内蒙古各族人民的抗日武装斗争做出了重要贡献。
    抗日战争胜利以后，在中国处于两种命运、两个前途大决战的形势下，内蒙古地区出现了一场分裂国家还是维护统一的严峻斗争。当时，以补英达赖为首的少数分裂分子，在苏尼特右旗召开了所谓的“内蒙古人民代表会议”，成立所谓的“内蒙古共和国临时政府”，妄图把内蒙古从祖国分裂出去。为了挫败他们的分裂阴谋，1945年10月，乌兰夫同志受党中央的委派，到那里做各阶层的工作，宣传党的民族政策，团结广大群众，并面对面地揭露补英达赖等人的分裂阴谋，迫使其取消了“临时政府”。周恩来同志称他的这次行动为“单刀赴会”，给予充分肯定和赞扬。1946年3月，根据中央指示，内蒙古自治运动联合会和东蒙古自治政府在承德举行自治运动统一会议。在预备会上，就自治运动的前进道路和领导权问题，存在着截然不同的两种主张：是在祖国大家庭内实现民族区域自治，还是搞“独立自治”；是接受中国共产党的领导，还是以内蒙古人民革命党来代替中国共产党。在这决定蒙古族人民命运的关键时刻，乌兰夫同志坚定地指出：内蒙古自治运动只能是在中国共产党领导下的中国人民民主革命的一部分；自治运动的正确道路，就是接受中国共产党领导，充分发动群众，实现内蒙古统一的民族区域自治；只能把内蒙古自治运动联合会作为统一领导自治运动的机构。在会上，乌兰夫同志把革命的坚定性和策略的灵活性结合起来，既坚持斗争又注意充分协商，终于团结、争取了大部分代表，取得了一致的意见。同年4月3日举行了正式会议，讨论通过了“内蒙古自治运动统一会议主要决议”，乌兰夫同志被推举为执委会及常委主席兼军事部长。“四·三”会议在蒙古民族历史上和内蒙古革命史上有着重要意义，它不但结束了内蒙古东西两部地区长期分割的局面，而且奠定了蒙古民族在统一的祖国大家庭内实行民族区域自治的政治基础。
    我们党经过长期的探索，找到了通过实行民族区域自治来解决国内民族问题的正确道路。乌兰夫同志是这条光辉道路上最勇敢的开拓者。1947年4月3日，内蒙古自治运动联合会召开内蒙古人民代表会议，乌兰夫同志在政治报告中总结了内蒙古自治运动的历史经验，得出了成立内蒙古自治政府的条件业已成熟的重要结论。会议决定成立自治政府，选出临时参议会，并经参议会选出乌兰夫同志为自治政府主席。5月1日内蒙古自治政府正式宣布成立，毛泽东主席和朱德总司令专门致电祝贺。从此，第一个民族自治区在中国大地上诞生，在创造实行民族区域自治制度的成功经验方面发挥了重大作用。
    乌兰夫同志历任内蒙古自治区党委第一书记、自治区人民委员会主席、内蒙古军区司令员兼政委、内蒙古自治区政协主席。他在主持内蒙古自治区工作近20年中，创造性地执行了党的民族区域自治政策和各项政策，团结并带领全区蒙汉各族人民在社会主义革命和建设中，取得了重大胜利，把内蒙古自治区建成模范自治区，为全国民族自治地方树立了榜样。
    新中国诞生后，乌兰夫同志历任中央人民政府委员，中央民族事务委员会党组书记、副主任、主任，国务院副总理，中共中央统战部部长，全国人大常委会副委员长和国家副主席，在参与党和国家的领导事务时，坚定不移地坚持马克思主义民族工作路线，不断推进全国民族团结进步事业。
    1956年，乌兰夫同志在党的第八次全国代表大会发言中，深刻地总结了在少数民族地区进行社会改革的历史经验，他指出，在牧区，民主改革和社会主义改造都可以和平的方式进行。他批评那些不注意民族差别，机械搬套汉族或者其他民族地区办法的错误倾向，指出对少数民族的改革问题，应正确反映各民族的特殊情况和实际需要。
    1957年，在青岛民族工作座谈会上，乌兰夫同志按照周恩来同志的建议作了重要发言，他指出，少数民族经过社会改革走社会主义道路，只是改革一切不利于社会主义、不利于本民族发展进步的东西，而不是消灭民族，相反地要发展民族，把各民族都发展成为具有高度经济、文化水平的民族。“到了社会主义社会，民族不仅是存在的，而且还得到繁荣。”他分析了我国实行民族区域自治，建立统一的多民族国家的必然性，指出了“充分实现少数民族的自治权利是贯彻民族区域自治的主要问题”。他要求进一步落实自治权利，制定有关的法令和具体规定，使少数民族真正当家作主，管理本民族内部事务。他还明确提出，“在民族区域自治和社会主义改造实现之后，在自治地方内，压倒一切的中心任务是进行社会主义建设。”
    1962年4月，乌兰夫同志在全国民族工作会议上作长篇报告，介绍内蒙古自治区实施民族区域自治和经济建设的经验。重申党的行之有效的民族政策、统战政策，阐明民族平等、民族团结、民族区域自治、民族发展繁荣的各项政策。他批驳了“都社会主义了，各民族都一样了，再提少数民族当家作主过时了”的错误观点，着重强调了实施民族区域自治的重要性和必要性。他的报告对纠正当时民族工作中的“左”的错误，起了积极的推动作用。
    1979年4月，乌兰夫同志在全国边防工作会议上作了重要报告。在十年内乱中，由于林彪、“四人帮”的严重干扰，民族工作受到极大的破坏。进行民族政策再教育，结合检查民族政策的执行情况，切实解决存在问题，十分重要。乌兰夫同志的报告，贯彻党的实事求是的思想路线，全面系统地重申和阐述了党的正确的民族政策和宗教政策，特别强调要重视和加速少数民族地区经济文化建设，并首次提出国家要组织内地省、市，实行对口支援边疆地区和少数民族地区。这篇报告，中央批转全国，要求各地结合实际情况，认真贯彻执行。
    乌兰夫同志担任国家副主席后日理万机，但他仍然十分关心民族工作，关注少数民族地区的改革事业。1985年4月4日，乌兰夫同志在招待出席六届三次全国人大和全国政协会议的少数民族代表、委员茶话会上发表讲话，指出：“民族地区的改革必须从实际出发，实事求是，不能追求一个模式，要创造性地贯彻执行中央的方针。”少数民族地区的改革，应充分考虑本地区的特点。“不管怎么改，标准是看你是否提高了经济效益，是否能发展生产力。”
    乌兰夫同志作为卓越的民族工作领导人，留给后人们的精神遗产是十分丰富和宝贵的，我们应当很好地学习、继承和发扬。乌兰夫同志的光辉形象将激励我们在新时期民族工作中不断开拓前进！
