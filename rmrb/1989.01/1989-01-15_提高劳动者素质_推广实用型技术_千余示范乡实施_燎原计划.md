The "Wildfire Plan," which aims to closely link education with rural economic development, has been implemented nationwide since it was approved by the State Council last September. So far, 22 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have established over 1,790 demonstration townships in more than 500 counties. These townships are implementing the plan based on their local economic and educational development realities and various economic development indicators.

The "Wildfire Plan" seeks to improve the qualifications of laborers through reforming and developing rural education. It aims to enhance the rural ability to absorb and apply scientific and technological knowledge, accelerate the popularization and promotion of practical scientific and technological knowledge and management skills, and promote rural economic development.

Many provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions are actively organizing the implementation of this plan. The Hebei Provincial Government, in October of last year, approved the trial plan submitted by the Provincial Education Commission, requiring all localities to seriously implement it. The province initially established 50 demonstration counties and 250 demonstration townships. Additionally, they held job training classes for vocational education management personnel and demonstration township officials in Nangong City and Wuqiao County. They trained principals of vocational high schools in demonstration counties and principals of agricultural technical schools in demonstration townships. The Provincial Education Commission organized visits and discussions on the implementation of the "Wildfire Plan," the role and function of vocational high schools and agricultural technical schools in this project, and selected different types of implementation plans. Currently, there are over 270,000 teachers in various specialized vocational schools in rural China, over 2.2 million teachers in ordinary middle schools, and over 4.8 million teachers in primary schools. They are important cultural and technical forces in rural areas. Provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions like Gansu and Shandong, similar to Hebei, attach great importance to and fully utilize this force in implementing the "Wildfire Plan."

The Gansu Provincial Government, in its approved and issued "Wildfire Plan" implementation plan, determined that the focus would be on training over 1.5 million young intellectuals in the province. It would rely on the existing 390-plus agricultural vocational high schools, rural vocational schools, and farmers' technical schools. It would mainly conduct various practical technology training sessions, widely promote "short, flat, and fast" practical technologies suitable for local needs, and implement the "Wildfire Plan" at the township and village levels to promote local economic development.

The "Wildfire Plan" office of the State Education Commission also introduced that this plan would closely cooperate with the "Spark Plan" and the "Harvest Plan," actively promote new technologies developed by the "Spark" and "Harvest" plans, and complete a large number of technical promotion and development projects that can enhance agricultural production potential and promote economic development.

　　提高劳动者素质　推广实用型技术
    千余示范乡实施“燎原计划”
    本报讯  记者马在新从国家教委获悉：旨在把教育同农村经济发展密切联系起来的“燎原计划”，自去年９月国务院批复以后，已在全国推行。到目前为止，已有２２个省、市、自治区在５００余个县的范围内，确立了１７９０多个示范乡，结合本地区农村的经济、教育发展实际和各项经济开发指标，先行实施这一计划。　
    所谓“燎原计划”就是通过改革和发展农村教育，大面积提高劳动者素质，增强农村吸收和运用科学技术的能力，加快农村实用科学技术和经营知识的普及与推广，促进农村经济的发展。
    许多省、市、区积极组织实施这一计划。河北省政府于去年１０月批转省教委的试行方案，要求各地认真实施，并首批在全省建立５０个示范县、２５０个示范乡。同时，他们还分别在南宫市、吴桥县举办职业教育管理干部培训班及示范乡干部培训班，培训示范县的职业中学校长和示范乡的乡镇农技校长。省教委组织他们参观，研讨组织实施“燎原计划”的路子，以及职业中学和农技校在这一工程中的地位和作用等，推选了不同类型的实施方案。我国农村各类专业技校的教师目前已有２７万多人，普通中学教师有２２０多万人，小学教师４８０多万人，他们是农村重要的文化技术力量。甘肃、山东等许多省、市、自治区，都同河北省一样，重视并充分发挥了这支力量在实施“燎原计划”中的重要作用。
    甘肃省政府在已批准下发的“燎原计划”实施方案中，确定以全省１５０多万知识青年为培训重点，以现有的３９０多所农业类中专、农村职业中学、农民技校为依托，以各种实用技术培训为主要内容，大面积推广适合当地需要的“短平快”实用技术，把“燎原计划”落实到乡、村，促进当地经济发展。
    国家教委“燎原计划”办公室还介绍说，这一计划将与“星火计划”和“丰收计划”紧密配合，积极推广“星火”、“丰收”计划开发的新技术，完成一大批能增强农业生产后劲、促进经济发展的技术推广和开发项目。
