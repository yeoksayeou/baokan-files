This face-off is done well!

According to a report from the *Farmers' Daily*, in Hubei's Jingmen City, there is a group of "fishing grandpas." Whenever they have public holidays or free time, they drive to the fish ponds they have contracted to fish. All 35 townships in the city have seen their tracks. Some of them can catch 40 kilograms of fish in just one morning from the fish ponds, and if they can't eat it all at home, they sell the rest at nearby markets. To appease the dissatisfied contract holders, the township governments generously compensate the "fishing grandpas" for part of the contract holders' losses. Of course, this will only have the effect of "using fish to drive away flies, the more flies come, and using meat to drive away ants, the more ants come." Some townships in the southern part of the city really feel they can't handle it, so they have to "tear off the face" and resist. This resistance is quite effective. It is said that in the townships that dare to tear off the face, the "fishing grandpas" have basically disappeared.

We should give a warm applause to these townships that dare to tear off this kind of face! They are right to do so, protecting the vital interests of the people, upholding socialist legal system, and maintaining the image of the Party and the government.

To improve the economic environment and rectify the economic order, all aspects need to work together in a comprehensive and coordinated manner. The broad masses of the people and the broad masses of cadres have the right and the power to supervise, resist, and even legally pursue all illegal and disorderly behaviors. This is the most important and powerful means among all means. Let everyone take up this weapon.

　　这脸皮撕得好！
　　官伟勋
    《农民日报》消息，湖北荆门市出了一批“钓爷”，每当公休或“业余”时间，就驱车下乡到已承包的鱼塘钓鱼。全市３５个乡镇都有他们的足迹。有的一个上午就从渔场养鱼塘钓走４０多公斤鱼，拿回家吃不了还到附近集市上出卖。乡镇政府为平息承包户的不满，便慷慨解囊为“钓爷”代赔承包户部分损失。当然，这只会起到“以鱼驱蝇蝇愈至，以肉去蚁蚁愈多”的作用。该市城南一些乡镇政府实在感到难以招架，便只好“撕破脸皮”加以抵制了。这一抵制还真灵。据说，凡是敢于撕破脸皮的乡镇，“钓爷”已基本绝迹。
    我们应为这些敢于撕破这类脸皮的乡镇政府热烈鼓掌叫好！他们撕得有理，既维护了群众的切身利益，维护了社会主义法制，也维护了党和政府的形象。
    治理经济环境整顿经济秩序，需要各方面全方位共同配套进行，广大群众与广大干部，对一切违法乱纪行为，敢于“撕破脸皮”实施监督、抵制，乃至依法追究的权力，永远是各种手段中最重要最有力的手段。愿人人拿起这个武器。
