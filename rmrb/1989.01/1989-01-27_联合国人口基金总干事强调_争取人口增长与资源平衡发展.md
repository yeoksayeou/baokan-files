The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) today called on all countries to work together over the next 10 years to achieve a balance between population growth and resource development.

This was stated in a declaration issued by Nafis Sadik, Executive Director of the UNFPA, on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the fund's establishment. Sadik pointed out that the "population programs" of the past 20 years have achieved many successes, and the implementation of the "population programs" in the next 10 years will have a decisive impact on the population situation in the 21st century. He said that the global population situation remains urgent. According to current population development trends, by the year 2100, the population will reach 10 billion. If the "population programs" are effectively implemented, the total population can be limited to 8 billion; but if they fail, the population will swell to 14 billion. Sadik said that 90% of population growth occurs in developing countries.

Sadik pointed out that China and some other developing countries have achieved some success in slowing the population growth rate.

At today's press conference, someone asked whether the UNFPA would need to regain the support of the United States. Sadik replied that in recent years, the United States has withdrawn its support for the fund, damaging international consensus on population issues. The U.S. refusal to provide funds on the grounds that the fund supports alleged forced abortions in China is unfounded.

　　联合国人口基金总干事强调    
    争取人口增长与资源平衡发展
    本报联合国１月２５日电  记者刘开宸报道：联合国人口活动基金（简称联合国人口基金）今天号召世界各国在下个１０年内齐心协力，争取人口增长与资源之间的平衡发展。
    这是在庆祝该基金成立２０周年之际，联合国人口基金总干事纳菲斯·萨迪克在这里发表的一项声明中所说的一番话。萨迪克指出，过去２０年的“人口计划”取得了许多成就，下一个１０年“人口计划”执行如何将对２１世纪人口情况起决定作用。他说，全球人口形势仍是紧急的，根据目前人口发展趋势，到２１００年，人口将增长到１００亿人。如“人口计划”有效执行，总人口可望限制在８０亿；但如失败，人口会膨胀到１４０亿。萨迪克说，９０％的人口增长发生在发展中国家。
    萨迪克指出，中国和其它一些发展中国家在减缓人口增长率方面，取得了一些成就。
    在今天的记者招待会上，有人问到联合国人口基金是否要重新得到美国的支持？萨迪克回答说，近几年，美国撤销对该基金的支持，损害了国际上在人口问题上的一致意见。美国以该基金支持所谓中国实行强制性堕胎为由拒付应提供的资金是站不住脚的。
