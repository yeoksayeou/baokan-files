	HANGZHOU, Jan. 23 (Xinhua) -- The Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau on Jan. 22 issued "special press cards" to political and legal reporters from various news organizations in Hangzhou. With these special press cards, reporters can interview and supervise the daily work of public security officers throughout the city, and public security officers are not allowed to arbitrarily refuse such interviews. Huang Ziguang, director of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, said that they are doing this to increase the transparency of public security work and strengthen the construction of a clean government.

	It is understood that in the work of public security management in Hangzhou, there have been instances of some officers engaging in corruption, such as embezzlement, bribery, and extortion. Due to the large and mobile nature of the public security personnel, it is difficult to investigate and handle these problems. Therefore, the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau decided to invite the news media to participate in supervision. Reporters can report or publicly expose any illegal or criminal behavior they witness during their interviews, assisting the Municipal Public Security Bureau in handling such cases.

　　邀请新闻单位参与监督　促进公安部门廉政建设     
    杭州向记者颁发“特殊采访证”
    据新华社杭州１月２３日电  杭州市公安局１月２２日向杭州各新闻单位的政法记者颁发了“特殊采访证”。记者们凭着这张特殊采访证可以对全市公安干警的日常工作进行采访和监督，公安干警不得随意拒绝。杭州市公安局长黄子钧说，他们这样做，是为了提高公安工作的透明度，加强廉政建设。
    据了解，杭州市在治安管理工作中，少数干警营私舞弊、索贿受贿的腐败现象时有发生。由于公安队伍人员庞杂，流动性大，这类问题的查处工作有一定难度。为此，杭州市公安局决定邀请新闻界来参与监督，记者在采访中耳闻目睹的干警违法犯罪行为，均可向有关部门反映或作公开报道，协助市公安局查处。
