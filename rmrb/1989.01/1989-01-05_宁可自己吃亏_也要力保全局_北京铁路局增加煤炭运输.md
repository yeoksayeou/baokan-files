The 350,000 employees of the Beijing Railway Bureau, in order to alleviate the current tight energy supply situation, completed the 1988 coal transport task of 1.9174 billion tons ahead of schedule. Without even having time to brush off the dust from their uniforms, they immediately launched into the intense battle of increasing coal transport for the new year. In the first three days of this year, the bureau averaged 9,456 coal cars per day, an increase of 699 cars compared to the same period last year, achieving a strong start.

The Beijing Railway Bureau is a major coal transport hub for the nation. Coal transport accounts for one-third of the total national railway transport, with 85% of the coal from Shanxi Province being transported out. In recent years, the bureau has spared no effort to overcome difficulties and tap into transport potential to increase coal transport. The amount of coal transported each year has increased by 150 to 200 million tons. This year, the bureau is tasked with transporting 2.015 billion tons of coal, an increase of 135 million tons from last year.

Coal is the primary energy source for national economic development. However, coal transport is a low-profit or even loss-making business for railways. According to relevant departments, for every 1,000 million tons of coal transported from Shanxi to East China, the Beijing Railway Bureau incurs an additional expenditure of 1 billion yuan, losing 398 million yuan in freight revenue compared to other goods. However, the state can increase industrial output value by 150 billion yuan as a result. The Beijing Railway Bureau prioritizes the national interest, willing to take a loss to ensure the completion of coal transport tasks. From the first day of the new year, they have been statistically analyzing the coal loading and dispatching situations for 30 provinces and cities with coal supply contracts, as well as 78 key enterprises including 7 major power grids, 8 major steel plants, and 3 major aluminum plants, striving to achieve balanced and quantitative loading and dispatching. Currently, the bureau is working hard to tap into transport potential, aiming to exceed the annual coal transport target.

### 宁可自己吃亏　也要力保全局  北京铁路局增加煤炭运输

　　宁可自己吃亏　也要力保全局
    北京铁路局增加煤炭运输
    本报讯  记者张国荣报道：北京铁路局的３５万名职工，为缓解当前能源供应紧张的状况，在提前完成１９８８年１．９１７４亿吨煤炭运输任务后，来不及掸去征衣上的灰尘，又立即投入新的一年增运煤炭的紧张战斗。今年头３天，这个局平均每天装运煤炭９４５６车，比去年同期增加６９９车，打了个开门红。
    北京铁路局是全国铁路的运煤大局。煤炭运量占全路的１／３，其中山西煤炭外运量占８５％。近年来，这个局为了多运煤炭，千方百计克服困难，挖掘运输潜力，完成的煤炭运输量每年都以１５００—２０００万吨的幅度递增。今年这个局承担煤炭运输任务２．０１５亿吨，比去年又增加１３５０万吨。
    煤炭是国民经济赖以发展的主要能源。但煤炭运输对铁路来说却是微利，甚至是亏本的买卖。据有关部门测算，从山西每运１０００万吨煤炭到华东，北京铁路局大约增加支出１亿元，比运其他物资少收运费３９８０万元，而国家却能因此增加工业产值１５０亿元。北京铁路局以国家大局为重，宁愿自己“吃亏”，也要保证煤炭运输任务的完成。从新年第一天起，他们就对订有煤炭供货合同的３０个省市和全国７大电网、８大钢厂、３大铝厂等７８家重点企业的用煤装车、发运情况，逐日统计分析，尽量做到按量均衡装运。目前，这个局正在努力挖掘运输潜力，争取全年煤炭运输任务的超额完成。
