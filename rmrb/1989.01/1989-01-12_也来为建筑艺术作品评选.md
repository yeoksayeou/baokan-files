Title: Let's Also Select and Award Architectural Artworks

Literature has awards, films have awards, fine arts, music, theater, and dance—all these art forms that stir people's hearts have awards, and some even have multiple types, probably totaling dozens. Regional selections aside, national selections are also frequent. Just by turning on the television, you can almost see such award ceremonies every week. This is indeed a good thing, indicating people's love for art and respect for artists. Its healthy development is undoubtedly an important aspect of spiritual civilization construction.

However, the field of architectural art seems quite lonely. The Ministry of Construction held a national annual excellent architectural design award in 1986, but society was too indifferent to it. The three first-prize winners (Lhasa Hotel, Que Li Guesthouse, International Exhibition Center) that were selected, apart from the architectural community, how many people can actually name them, let alone know the names of the creators?

This discordant note has caused confusion among architectural artists, to the point where one architect wrote: "Up to now, the concept of architectural culture and architectural art to the public is almost like a foreign tale. Since ancient times, China has had very few works that record architectural art, document the activities of architects, and summarize architectural theory. There are very few works that have sparked public commentary. Even now, the creations of Chinese architects are still like a one-sided love. True tragedies are all social in nature, and the tragedy of architecture is no exception." (China Arts Newspaper, 1988, Issue 17). Last year, People's Daily published a short article by literary theorist Ye Tingfang titled "Architects, Please Come Out to 'Take a Bow'" expressing similar lamentations.

Architectural art should not be treated with such indifference. In the West, starting from Hegel and even earlier, architecture has been considered the pinnacle of all arts, recognizing its immense artistic infectious power and deep cultural connotations, calling it the "stone book of history" (Victor Hugo) and the "annals of history" (Gogol). Contemporary artist Jensen even calls architecture a "peak artistic achievement." He says, "When we think of past great civilizations, we have a habit of using visible, monumental architecture as the unique symbol of each civilization." Even in modern times, this recognition has not diminished: winners of the British Royal Society Gold Medal and the Japanese Cultural Grand Prize are often architects; the Soviet Union's "Lenin Cultural Gold Medal" awards three medals each year, one of which is specifically for architects; Reagan awarded a medal to I.M. Pei in 1986 during the U.S. national celebration, and France also held a state funeral for Le Corbusier; since the 1980s, even Chinese architects have won over 70 medals abroad.

However, these comparisons do not mean that the Chinese public is only interested in "architecture" when it comes to housing allocation. Just look at the Forbidden City, which attracts an average of 50,000 visitors per day, and the Great Wall, the Summer Palace, and the Temple of Heaven are also teeming with people, to the point of alarming the cultural relics protection authorities. In the end, isn't the main attraction of going to these places the architectural art? In this sense, the public still needs architectural art, and saying that its audience is not inferior to other arts is also reasonable. It's just that most people seem to be unaware of this.

Where does the problem lie? I think it's mainly due to insufficient propaganda, and the public's cultural and artistic literacy also needs improvement, and these two factors are related. In fact, architecture is a difficult and profound art, both hard to create and hard to appreciate. In the current situation where various "popular" arts are thriving, it should be given more attention.

The Chinese Academy of Arts, the Chinese Contemporary Architectural Culture Salon, and the Chinese Environmental Art Society (in preparation), aware of this, have decided to hold a selection activity for "Excellent Architectural Artworks of the 1980s in China." I wholeheartedly support this. They will invite architects, artists, aestheticians, and other experts from the cultural and artistic community to form a selection committee of about 200 people, and announce the selection results on July 1, 1989, World Architecture Day. The public recommendation and self-recommendation process has already begun.

The significance of this activity is self-evident. I think it is not so much about the selection results (it is said that this is a purely civilian activity with no funding, and the winners will only receive a certificate, and probably won't be able to take home a color TV). Rather, it is helpful in establishing a new trend.

For architects, there is also a universal benefit: at least it can make the "client" authorities know that architectural design also has an artistic creation aspect, and in this field, just like other artistic creations, it is not something that can be arbitrarily commanded.

### 也来为建筑艺术作品评选

　　也来为建筑艺术作品评选
    晓月
    文学有评奖，电影有评奖，美术、音乐、戏剧、舞蹈，这些触动人们心弦的艺术创作和活动，样样都有评奖，有的还不止一种，大概总不下几十种之多吧。地区性的评选且不说，全国性的评选也是此起彼伏，只要打开电视机，几乎每个星期都有这类评奖的场面。这确实是一件好事，说明了人们对艺术的热爱和对艺术家的尊重。它的健康发展，无疑是精神文明建设的一个重要方面。
    但，惟独建筑艺术领域显得相当寂寞。建设部在１９８６年举行过一次全国性的年度优秀建筑设计评奖，社会对它却过于冷淡了。这次评出的３个一等奖（拉萨饭店、阙里宾舍、国际展览中心），除了建筑界，到底有多少人能说得出来，更不用说知道创作者的名字了。
    这种不谐调音程，引起了建筑艺术家的困惑，以至于一位建筑师写道：“迄今为止，关于建筑文化和建筑艺术的观念之于大众差不多还是一种海外奇谈。自古以来中国就极少记述建筑艺术、记载建筑师活动和总结建筑理论的著作，极少有作品引起大众评论。即便在现在，中国建筑师们的创作仍类似于一种单相思。真正的悲剧都是具有社会性的，建筑的悲剧亦如此。”（《中国美术报》１９８８年第１７期）。人民日报去年登载了文艺理论家叶廷芳的短文《请建筑师出来“谢幕”》也发出过类似的感慨。
    建筑艺术不应该受到这样的冷遇。在西方，从黑格尔开始甚至更早得多，就视建筑为一切艺术之首了，认识到它的巨大的艺术感染力量和深涵的文化意蕴，称之为“石头的史书”（雨果）和“历史的年鉴”（果戈里）。当代艺术家简森更称建筑是一种“巅峰性的艺术成就”。他说“当我们想起过去伟大的文明时，我们有一种习惯就是应用看得见、有纪念性的建筑作为每个文明独特的象征”。直到现代，这种认识也并未少衰：英国皇家学会金奖、日本文化大奖的得主往往都是建筑艺术家；苏联的“列宁文化金奖”每年颁发三枚，其中一枚规定颁发给建筑师；里根在１９８６年美国国庆时为贝聿铭授勋，法国也曾为柯比举行了国葬；８０年代以来，甚至中国建筑师在国外都获得了７０多块奖牌。
    但这些对比并不说明中国大众只是在分房子时才对“建筑”大感兴趣，君不见，故宫游人平均一天竟达５万人，长城、颐和园、天坛也是满山满谷，以致于引起了文物保护部门的惊呼。说白了，到这些地方去，不就是主要欣赏建筑艺术吗？这样说来，大众还是需要建筑艺术的，说它的观众并不亚于其它艺术，也还不是没有道理的。只是，似乎多数人并没有自觉到这一点。
    问题出在哪里？我看，一是宣传不够，再就是大众的文化艺术素质也还有待提高，这两者又是相关的。事实上，建筑是一种艰难的、高深的艺术，既难于创作，又难于赏鉴。在目前各种“流行”艺术走红的情况下，就更应该予以关注了。
    中国艺术研究院、中国当代建筑文化沙龙、中国环境艺术学会（筹）有鉴于此，决定举办“中国八十年代建筑艺术优秀作品”评选活动，我为此举手叫好。他们将邀请建筑家、美术家、美学家和其它文化艺术界的专家组成约二百人的选举团，在１９８９年７月１日世界建筑节时公布评选结果，现在已开始了群众推荐和自荐。
    这次活动的意义自不待言，我看并不在于评选的结果（据说，这是一次纯民间活动，没有资金，获奖者也不过只是得到一张奖状，大约不会有彩电可以抱走的），而是有助于一种新风气的创行。
    对于建筑师来说，还有一个普遍的好处，就是至少可以使“甲方”执权者知道，建筑设计也还具有艺术创作的一面，在这个领域内，正像其它艺术创作一样，也是不能随便下命令的。
