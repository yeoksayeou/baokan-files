In Jiangsu Province, the first county-level drama troupe to introduce an enterprise mechanism, the Gan Yu County Peking Opera Troupe, has, in less than half a year, emerged from the predicament of "relying on subsidies to make a living and passively awaiting dissolution."

Established in 1950, this troupe had a certain reputation among the county-level Peking Opera troupes in northern Jiangsu. In recent years, under the impact of various new artistic trends, it, like many Peking Opera troupes, has found itself in a state of wanting to let go but not being able to, and wanting to advance but not being able to: performances were not popular, shows were assigned by quota, annual subsidies from higher authorities were all used for personnel expenses, and salaries were often only 70% of the full amount, causing morale to waver. In June of last year, with the support of the county committee and county government, the troupe underwent a comprehensive reform. While retaining the troupe's roster, 7 core performers formed the backbone, and 21 performers were recruited from society and other places to form the Huanghai Song and Dance Art Troupe. The remaining 32 people utilized existing conditions to engage in various forms of business such as transportation, restaurants, hotels, shops, and video rentals. The leadership and management personnel of the troupe were reduced from 8 to 3, and the troupe leader was selected through open competition.

In the course of the reform, they introduced the enterprise mechanism into the entire troupe, breaking the "iron rice bowl." Except for those over 55 years old (men) and 45 years old (women), and retired personnel, fixed salaries were abolished for everyone. The tertiary industry adopted a contract system with surplus sharing, while the art troupe members received performance bonuses based on labor, artistry, and morality. Scoring was done through mutual evaluation, with small evaluations every ten days and total evaluations every month, creating a tiered system. They also implemented a contract system for performers, allowing those with consistently low scores and no improvement to be dismissed and replaced by others. This distribution and employment system created both pressure and motivation for the performers.

The reform has brought new vitality to this old troupe. In the past five months, the art troupe has performed over a hundred times, with their artistic level continuously improving. At the same time, the troupe's economic benefits have significantly increased, with per capita income far exceeding the original salary. Those who once considered finding another path have now settled down. Currently, this troupe has become a competitive artistic team.

　　过去：补助度日难　节目没人看
  　现在：艺精收入增　打破铁饭碗
    赣榆县京剧团靠改革走出困境
    本报讯  在江苏省县级剧团中第一个引入企业机制的赣榆县京剧团，不到半年走出了“靠补助度日子、束手坐待解散”的困境。
    这个团建于１９５０年，在苏北市县京剧团中小有名气。近年来，在各种艺术新潮流的冲击下，它也像许多京剧团一样，步入欲弃不舍、欲进不能的境地：节目没人看，演出靠摊派，上级每年拨款全部用于人头费，工资还常常只发７０％，人心浮动。去年６月，在县委、县政府支持下，剧团进行了全面改革。在保留剧团编制的情况下，由７名演员骨干为班底，从社会和外地招聘２１名演员，组建了黄海歌舞艺术团。余下的３２人，利用现有条件搞起运输、饭店旅社、商店、放录像等多种经营。剧团领导、管理人员由８人减为３人，团长公开竞选。
    在改革中，他们把企业机制引入全团内部，打破铁饭碗。除男５５岁以上、女４５岁以上和离退休人员外，全部取消固定工资。第三产业实行承包超利分成，艺术团人员则按劳、艺、德分计场分红。打分采取互评方法，旬小评月总评，拉开档次。他们还对演员实行合同制聘用，长期低分又无长进者，可辞退另聘他人。这种分配和用工制度，使演员有压力有动力。
    改革给这个老剧团带来新的生机。５个月来，艺术团演出上百场，艺术水平日见提高。同时，全团经济效益大增，人均收入大大超过了原来的工资额。原来一些想另找出路的，现在安心了。目前，该团已经成为一支具有一定竞争力的艺术队伍。
