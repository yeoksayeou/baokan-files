The state will soon redefine and implement maximum prices for means of production to strengthen the management of the market for means of production. The black and non-ferrous metals subject to maximum pricing include steel, copper, aluminum, nickel, zinc, tin, and related major raw materials and intermediate products, which currently face significant supply-demand imbalances and have high and chaotic prices.

Vice Minister of the Ministry of Materials, Lù Xùshēng, recently told a reporter that the new maximum prices being prepared for implementation are measures taken by the state to regulate the market for means of production. Compared to the maximum prices implemented at the beginning of last year, this round of maximum prices and their implementation methods have made significant progress.

He pointed out that the newly defined maximum prices generally stipulate that all specifications of the same type of steel should be subject to maximum pricing. The maximum price level will be determined based on the average production cost of products outside the production plan, reasonable profits, normal operating costs, and appropriate consideration of market supply and demand, while also referencing the maximum prices from the beginning of last year. The prices will be adjusted as needed based on actual conditions.

Lù Xùshēng emphasized that after the new maximum prices are announced, all departments and regions, including Guangdong, Hainan, Fujian, and various special economic zones, must strictly comply with the maximum prices. Prices exceeding the maximum prices will be considered illegal price violations. The maximum prices limit both factory prices and sales prices. Production enterprises and their affiliated supply and marketing cooperatives selling their own produced limited-price products must strictly adhere to the maximum factory price and are not allowed to sell at the maximum sales price. Material trading enterprises transferring limited-price products, regardless of the number of links involved, must not exceed the maximum sales price.

### 国家将重定生产资料最高限价  一经公布任何部门地区必须一律执行

　　国家将重定生产资料最高限价
    一经公布任何部门地区必须一律执行
    据新华社北京１月１１日电  （记者徐克洪）国家将于近期内重新制定并执行生产资料最高限价，以加强对生产资料市场的管理。实行最高限价的黑色、有色金属产品主要是目前供求矛盾突出，价格既高又乱的钢材、铜、铝、镍、锌、锡以及相关的主要原材料和中间产品。
    物资部副部长陆叙生日前对记者说，正在准备执行的新的最高限价是国家为了调控生产资料市场而采取的措施。此次最高限价及其执行办法同去年初那次最高限价相比，有了明显的进步。
    他指出，重新制定的最高限价原则上规定同一品种所有规格的钢材都要实行最高限价；最高限价水平将按照生产计划外产品的平均生产成本、合理利润、正常经营费用及适当考虑市场供求情况，并参照去年初最高限价来确定；限价将根据实际情况经常进行适当调整。
    陆叙生强调说，新的最高限价公布后，包括广东、海南、福建及各经济特区在内的任何部门、任何地区都必须一律执行最高限价，超过最高限价的，均属价格违法行为。最高限价既限出厂价格，又限销售价格，生产企业及其所属供销机构自销本企业生产的限价产品，必须严格执行最高出厂限价，不准按最高销售限价销售。物资经营企业之间调拨限价产品，不论经过多少环节，均不得突破最高销售限价。
