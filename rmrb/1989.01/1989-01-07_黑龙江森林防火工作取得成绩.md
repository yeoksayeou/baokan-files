The Heilongjiang Province has been actively engaged in forest protection and fire prevention work. In 1988, the entire province not only avoided major forest fires and catastrophic forest fire disasters but also saw the lowest number of fire alarms, fire incidents, burned forest area, and economic losses in a decade.

In 1988, Heilongjiang Province recorded a total of 95 forest fire alarms and incidents, including 81 fire alarms and 14 fire incidents. Compared to 1987, these numbers decreased by approximately 50%, representing only 23% of the average annual fire alarms and incidents over the previous 10 years.
