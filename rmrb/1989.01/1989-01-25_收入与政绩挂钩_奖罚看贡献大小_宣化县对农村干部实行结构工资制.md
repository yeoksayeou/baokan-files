In Xuanhua County, Hebei Province, the salaries of village, township, and county cadres are no longer fixed. This change is due to the county's implementation of a structured salary system based on defined positions and staffing.

Xuanhua County began implementing the structured salary system in 1987. The structured salary consists of four parts: basic salary, seniority pay, performance pay, and bonus. The basic salary is a fixed amount determined by the size and economic conditions of the village, and it varies from village to village. Seniority pay is based on the number of years a cadre has served, starting from the implementation of the household responsibility system in 1982, and it increases annually. Performance pay is determined by the village's economic performance and the cadre's contributions. The higher the performance above the set target, the more performance pay is received. If the performance does not meet the target, a corresponding deduction is made. The bonus is awarded based on the completion of annual tasks in material and spiritual civilization, evaluated by the township evaluation committee, and given as a one-time reward at the end of the year.

Practice has shown that the structured salary system is effective:

	— It strengthens the cohesion of the village leadership. One key feature of the structured salary system is that it evaluates the overall performance of the village, which requires the village leadership to work together to improve the work.

	— It stimulates competition among village cadres. Another feature of the structured salary system is that individual income is linked to contributions, encouraging competition and differentiation in salaries. In Xiaocun Township, 62 village cadres received an average annual bonus of 419 yuan last year. In Shuizhuang Village, 5 cadres received only 214.2 yuan in annual bonuses due to poor performance and lack of practical work.

	— It stabilizes the village cadre team. Seniority pay increases with the length of service, reflecting the cadre's accumulated years of work. Combined with performance-based income, this has a positive effect on stabilizing the village cadre team.

　　收入与政绩挂钩　奖罚看贡献大小
  　宣化县对农村干部实行结构工资制
    本报讯  在河北省宣化县，村干部、乡干部、县干部的工资待遇，再也不是一成不变的。这是因为这个县在定员定编的基础上，积极推行了结构工资制。
    宣化县是从１９８７年开始实行结构工资制的。结构工资是由基本工资、工龄工资、效益工资和奖励工资组成。基本工资是根据村庄大小和经济状况制订的固定报酬部分。村与村之间的数额不尽相同。工龄工资是以村干部任职年限为依据，逐年增加，按月发放。一般是从实行联产承包责任制的１９８２年算起。效益工资是指按村经济效益的高低和村干部的贡献大小发放的工资部分。超过规定指标越高，效益工资就越多。达不到规定指标的，则按比例扣罚。奖励工资是把全年任务分为物质文明和精神文明两大项，实行百分考核，年终经乡评委会评定后，按得分多少给予一次性奖励。
    实践表明，结构工资效果良好：
    ——增强了村级领导班子的凝聚力。结构工资制的一个重要特点，是以村的整体工作效果为考核依据，这就要求村领导班子成员齐心协力，共同把工作抓上去。
    ——激发了村干部搞好工作的竞争性。结构工资制的另一个特点，是个人收入多少与贡献大小挂钩，鼓励个人之间竞争、竞赛，拉开了工资档次。小村乡１２个村６２名村干部，去年底人均年奖励工资４１９元。水地庄村５名干部因抓工作不得力，办实事少，按基本工资的１５％受罚后，人均年奖励工资只有２１４．２元。
    ——稳定了村干部队伍。工龄工资是根据任期增长的，体现村干部的年功积累，再加上工作有实绩收入就增加，对稳定村干部起了积极作用。
