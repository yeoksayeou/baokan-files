The World Badminton Grand Prix Finals concluded today in Hong Kong, with all five titles decided. The Chinese team secured four of these championships.

Zhang Qingwu defeated last year's champion and teammate Xiong Guobao with a score of 10:15, 15:4, 15:8, to win the men's singles title in an unexpected outcome. Xiong, 27, made numerous errors and did not perform to his usual standard, failing to defend his title.

In the women's singles final, Han Aiping, relying on her rich experience and solid technique, easily defeated South Korean newcomer Lee Young-sook, who is eight years younger, with a score of 11:1, 11:5 in straight sets.

Yesterday, in the women's singles semifinals, Li Lingwei was defeated by Lee Young-sook, while Han Aiping struggled to defeat South Korean player Hwang Hye-young.

After the match, Han Aiping said, "Today, I was more adapted to the court conditions, lighting, and the indoor wind direction. Additionally, by playing more backcourt shots, I prevented my opponent from executing quick attacks. Moreover, Lee Young-sook seemed a bit tense today and did not perform her techniques well."

In the women's doubles final, China's Lin Ying and Guan Weizhen defeated South Korea's Jeong Myeong-hee and Hwang Hye-young with a score of 15:4, 15:9, securing the title once again. In the mixed doubles, China's Wang Pengren and Shi Fangjing defeated England's Ann Gardiner and Gillian Gilks with a score of 15:6, 15:6, to claim the championship. The men's doubles title went to Malaysia's Jao Sidiq and Razif Sidek.

　　世界羽毛球大奖赛总决赛落幕
    中国选手摘取四项冠军
    本报香港１月８日电  世界羽毛球系列大奖赛总决赛今天在此间决出全部５项桂冠。中国队拿走其中４项冠军。
    张青武以１０∶１５、１５∶４、１５∶８挫败上届冠军、队友熊国宝，取得男单冠军，这一战果出人意外。２７岁的熊国宝在这场角逐中失误多，发挥不够理想，未能实现蝉联冠军的愿望。
    韩爱平在女子单打决赛中，凭借丰富经验和过硬技术，顺利地以１１∶１、１１∶５直落两局击败比她年轻８岁的南朝鲜新秀李英淑。
    昨天女单半决赛，李玲蔚被李英淑击败，韩爱平虽打胜南朝鲜黄惠英，但也显得相当吃力。
    比赛后，韩爱平说，今天对场地、灯光以及馆内风向比较适应，而且多打后场球，使对手打不起快攻。此外，李英淑今天有点拘谨，技术发挥不好。
    在女子双打决赛中，中国队林瑛和关渭贞以１５∶４、１５∶９轻取南朝鲜的郑明熙和黄惠英，再次获得冠军。中国的王朋仁和史方静以１５∶６、１５∶６击败英格兰的安·古德和吉·高尔斯，夺得混双冠军。获男子双打冠军的是马来西亚的贾·西德克和拉·西德克兄弟。
