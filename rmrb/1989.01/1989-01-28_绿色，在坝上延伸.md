Ten years ago, a report titled "Sands Threaten Beijing" sounded the alarm about nature's revenge. At the same time, a massive greening project began at the capital's northern gate—the Zhangjiakou region of Hebei Province.

Ten years, a long relay of greening! Today, a 700-li-long green barrier has risen on the plateau. It stretches from east to west, blocking the cold winds from Siberia and making the "Yellow Dragon" tremble; it protects millions of acres of farmland and improves the air quality in Beijing.

A Group of "Qu Yuan" and a Patch of Green

The Zhangjiakou plateau region is already short of trees, and during the Cultural Revolution, large-scale reclamation led to grassland salinization, farmland desertification, and severe ecological damage, with "Yellow Dragons" (sandstorms) rising frequently. There is a saying: "A wind on the plateau lasts from the beginning to the end of the year, the wind covers the sun, and oil lamps are lit during the day."

Under such harsh conditions, large-scale afforestation is extremely difficult, but the people of the plateau have never relaxed their pursuit of greenery.

In Kangbao County's Xiaopeng Village, there is a bare hill called "Bald Hill." To protect the ten thousand acres of fertile land below, the villagers joined forces. Over 200 people worked for more than 20 days, digging 10,000 fish-scale pits, carrying 10,000 loads of water, traveling 10,000 kilometers, and planting 50,000 trees, totaling nine "tens." A year later, the bare hill turned green. The villagers renamed "Bald Hill" to "Nine Ten Hill" to commemorate the greening effort.

In 1981, Shengyi County's Caoquangou Village resident Jin Weijian took over a sand-filled gully behind the village. He used his only three mu of watery land to grow seedlings and led his three children to gradually green the gully from the mouth. Later, two daughters got married, but every spring and autumn, he still called them back to help. After seven years of hard work, the 500-plus mu of sand-filled gully was fully covered in green. Last year, this old "Qu Yuan" took over another bare hill.

Jin Weijian is just one of the millions of greening soldiers on the plateau. Ten years of afforestation, whether workers, farmers, cadres, or technical personnel, have all sweated for it.

Green Built by Youth

Not long ago, we climbed to a high point in Zhangbei County. Looking down, we saw crisscrossing green belts weaving the farmland into blocks; tall poplars stood like stern sentinels, neatly arranged. There was a small stone tablet at the high point with six large characters: "Youth Project Forest."

When the "Three-North" Shelterbelt Project began, the Communist Youth League of Zhangjiakou Municipal Committee decided to create "Youth Project Forests."

The Youth League Committee of Xia'ertai Township in Zhangbei County once set up a 40-li-long battlefield in the hundred-year-old Jiucai Gorge, which is now lush with green trees. The township comrades introduced that initially, after a few days, the bloodstains of more than 2,300 young volunteers remained on the handles of their hoes. These 100,000 mu of barren hills were greened under the bloodstained hoes.

We did not count the number of "Youth Project Forests" in the entire region, but we know that this activity is still ongoing. In Zhangbei County alone, after six springs and autumns of hard work by the county's youth league members and young people, 150,000 mu of "Youth Project" forests have been created.

"To Serve as an Official is to Green the Land"

In recent years, Zhangjiakou region has invested tens of thousands of laborers in greening each year, planting millions of trees annually. Such a rapid greening pace is inseparable from the joint efforts of leaders at all levels.

Wang Quan, a 50-year-old regional government official, is a "tree-planting enthusiast." When he was the deputy county magistrate of Chicheng County, while others were busy opening mountains to create fields, he led people to plant 150,000 oil pines on the bare Jianzi Ridge; during his tenure as the deputy secretary of the Yuxian County Party Committee, he promoted road greening, and now the roadsides throughout the county are shaded; in 1982, when he became the Zhangbei County Party Committee secretary, he led the county's people to utilize the "time difference" between spring planting and autumn harvesting to plant 220,000 mu of trees in one year.

In 1983, after Wang Quan became the regional government official, he summarized the experience of some places on the plateau in combining forest and grassland protection and developing economic forests in the lower plateau, proposing the idea of "combining trees, shrubs, and grasses" and "combining shelterbelt forests, timber forests, and economic forests." In five years, the entire region developed more than 400,000 mu of new economic forests alone.

"The slogan "To serve as an official is to green the land" has become a voluntary action for the vast number of cadres in Zhangjiakou region.

Over the past ten years, although the cadres here have changed batch after batch, the relay race towards greenery has continued.

### 绿色，在坝上延伸

　　绿色，在坝上延伸
    河北  杨振武  马宝山
    １０年前，一篇《风沙紧逼北京城》的报道，向人们拉响了大自然报复的警笛。与此同时，首都的北大门——河北张家口地区的浩大绿色工程也拉开了序幕。
    １０年，一场旷日持久的绿色接力！而今，一道长７００华里的绿色屏障在坝上崛起。它横贯东西，阻挡着西伯利亚袭来的寒流，肆虐的“黄龙”也要畏惧三分；它保护着千万亩农田，也使北京城里的空中环境得到一定改善。
    　　　　一群“愚公”一片绿
    张家口坝上地区本就缺林少树，“文革”期间大面积的垦荒，又带来草场碱化，耕地沙化，自然生态遭到严重破坏，“黄龙”四起。有谚云：“坝上一场风，年始到年终，风来沙盖日，白天点油灯。”
    在如此恶劣的条件下大面积造林，困难可想而知，但坝上人丝毫没有放松对绿色的追求。
    康保县小棚村有座光秃秃的荒山，人称“和尚头”。为了保护山下的万亩良田，村里人齐上阵。２００多人干了２０多天，硬是在山上挖鱼鳞坑１万个，运水１万担，行程１万公里，栽树５万棵等，合起来总共９个“万”。一年后，荒山涂上了绿色。村里人为纪念这次绿化，把“和尚头”改名为“九万坡”。
    １９８１年，尚义县曹碾沟村民靳维建承包了村后一条风沙沟，他用自己仅有的３分水田育苗，带领３个孩子从沟口往里一点一点地绿化。后来，两个女儿出嫁了，但每年的春秋两季，他还要把女儿叫回来帮忙。经过整整７个年头的苦战，５００多亩的风沙沟全部披上了绿装。去年，这位老“愚公”又承包了一座荒山。
    靳维建不过是坝上千万绿化大军中的一员。１０年造林，无论工人，还是农民，无论机关干部，还是科技人员，都没有少洒汗水。
    　　　　青春筑成的“青字号”
    不久前我们登上张北县境内的一个制高点。俯视四野一条条林带纵横交错，把农田编织成块块网状；一棵棵挺拔的白杨，犹如威严的哨兵，排列得整整齐齐。制高点有块不大的石碑，上面六个大字赫然：“青字号工程林”。
    “三北”防护林工程一开始，共青团张家口地委就作出了营造“青字号工程林”的决定。
    张北县小二台乡团委曾在沉睡百年的韭菜沟摆下过４０里长的战场，如今这里已是绿树成行，郁郁葱葱。乡里的同志介绍说，当初，几天下来，２３００多名青年突击队员用过的镐柄上留下了片片血迹，这１万多亩荒山就是在带血的镐柄下染绿的。
    我们没有统计全区“青字号工程林”的数字，只知道，这一活动至今仍在进行着，仅张北县，经过全县团员、青年６个春秋的鏖战，营造的“青字号”就有１５万亩。
    　　　　“为官一任，绿化一方”
    近几年，张家口地区每年都有数万名劳力投入绿化，每年造林百万亩。如此迅猛的绿化速度，是与各级领导的齐抓共管分不开的。
    ５０岁的地区行署专员王权就是个“植树迷”。他任赤城县副县长时，别人忙着抓开山造田，他却带人在光秃秃的尖子岭栽上了１５万株油松；他任蔚县县委副书记期间，又抓道路绿化，现在全县境内公路两旁都已绿荫如盖；１９８２年，他任张北县委书记，又领导全县人民利用春种秋收的“时间差”，一年造林２２万亩。
    １９８３年，王权当了地区行署专员后，总结了坝上一些地方搞林草共围和坝下发展经济林的经验，提出“乔灌草结合”、“防护林、用材林和经济林结合”的设想，５年间全区光是新发展的经济林就有４０多万亩。
    “为官一任，绿化一方”，这一充满激情的口号已变为张家口地区广大干部的自觉行动。
    １０年来，这里的干部虽然换了一茬又一茬，但向绿色进军的接力赛一直延续着。
