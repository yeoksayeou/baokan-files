China's 40th World Table Tennis Championships Team List Confirmed

	Newcomers Abound, Drawing Attention

	BEIJING (January 28) — The Chinese Table Tennis Association has submitted the list of athletes participating in the 40th World Table Tennis Championships to the organizing committee. Among the 22 athletes China has registered, the majority are newcomers participating in a major international competition for the first time. In the men's team of 12 athletes, 6 are newcomers. The women's team is predominantly young, with 7 newcomers. The average age of the women's team is just over 20 years old.

	The male athletes are: Jiang Jialiang, Chen Longzhan, Teng Yi, Xu Zengcai, Hui Jin, Wei Qingguang (the above six have participated in the previous World Table Tennis Championships), Chen Zhibin, Ma Wenge, Yu Shentong, Xie Chaojie, Lin Zhigang, Wang Yonggang. Additionally, Wang Tao is the reserve athlete.

	The 10 female athletes are: Chen Jing, Li Huifen, Chen Zihe (the above three are veterans from the previous championships), Hu Xiaoxin, Qiao Hong, Deng Yaping, Li Jun, Ding Yaping, Liu Wei, Gao Jun.

	Shanghai, once renowned as the cradle of China's world table tennis champions, surprisingly has no representatives in this selection. The registered athletes are predominantly from Hubei and Beijing, with 3 athletes each.

	It is understood that the 40th World Table Tennis Championships will be the largest in history, with 83 countries and regions registering athletes to participate. The competition is scheduled to take place from March 29 to April 9 in Dortmund, Germany. Due to the large number of registered athletes, the organizing committee may advance the competition by one day. Thirty years ago, it was in Dortmund that Rong Guotuan won China's first world table tennis championship, marking the first world championship in China's sports history.

　　我参加４０届世乒赛选手名单确定    
    新手众多　引人关注
    本报讯  记者刘小明报道：中国乒协日前已向第４０届世界乒乓球锦标赛组委会报上参赛选手名单。中国队报名的２２位运动员中，第一次参加世界大赛的新人占多数。其中男队１２名选手里新人有６位；女队年轻新秀更是占绝大部分，有７人之多。女队的平均年龄仅２０岁多一点。
    男运动员是：江嘉良、陈龙灿、滕毅、许增才、惠钧、韦晴光（以上６人参加过上届世乒赛）、陈志斌、马文革、于沈潼、谢超杰、林志刚、王永刚。此外，王涛为替补选手。
    １０名女将是：陈静、李惠芬、陈子荷（以上三人是上届老队员）、胡小新、乔红、邓亚萍、李隽、丁亚萍、刘伟、高军。
    曾被誉为我国乒乓球世界冠军摇篮的上海，这次竟无一人入选参赛。报名的选手中来自湖北队和北京队的最多，各３人。
    据了解，第４０届世乒赛将是历史上规模最大的一届世乒赛，已有８３个国家和地区的选手报名参赛。比赛定于３月２９日至４月９日在联邦德国多特蒙德市举行。由于报名选手太多，组委会可能将赛期提前一天。３０年前，容国团就是在多特蒙德市夺得第一个乒乓球世界冠军，这也是我国体育史上的第一个世界冠军。
