Every year, tens of thousands of ethnic minority patients receive meticulous treatment from the medical staff of the 12th Hospital of the Southern Xinjiang Military Region, allowing them to return to their snow-covered pastures and oases in the desert. Therefore, this hospital is affectionately called the "savior" by the various ethnic groups in Southern Xinjiang.

The people of Southern Xinjiang are primarily Uighur, with over 40 other ethnic minorities residing in the area. Their medical and health conditions are relatively poor, and the farmers and herdsmen of various ethnic groups lack access to medical care and medicine. The staff of the 12th Hospital, stationed at the foot of the Kunlun Mountains, treat the patients of various ethnic groups as their own family members and are dedicated to curing their ailments.

Since 1984, this hospital has been recognized multiple times by the People's Government of the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region, the Ministry of Civil Affairs, and the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army as an advanced unit for supporting the government and loving the people, as well as an advanced collective for ethnic unity and progress.

　　南疆军区１２医院被群众称为“救星”
    本报讯每年都有成千上万的少数民族病人，得到南疆军区１２医院医护人员的精心治疗，而重返雪山牧场、沙漠绿洲。因此，这个医院被南疆各族人民称为“救星”。
    南疆地区的人民，以维吾尔族为主体，聚居着４０多个少数民族。他们的医疗卫生条件较差，各族农牧民缺医少药。驻扎在昆仑山下的１２医院全院人员便把各族病人当成自己的亲人，热心为边疆群众除病去疾。
    自１９８４年以来，这个医院先后６次被新疆维吾尔自治区人民政府、民政部和解放军总政治部等评为拥政爱民先进单位和民族团结进步先进集体。
