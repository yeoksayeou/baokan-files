A report from our correspondent, Lu Jichuan: On January 11, the Yantai Zhifu Computer Company held a demonstration of the TM Voice-Numeric Chinese Card in Yantai. A 16-year-old operator achieved a typing speed of 369 characters per minute, earning praise from the attendees.

The company's developed Chinese Card uses a fixed board with the "Chinese Phonetic-Numeric Coding" scheme, which was the only phonetic input scheme to receive the A-class award in the 1986 National First Chinese Keyboard Input Competition. This system follows the rules of Chinese phonetics, using phonetic codes for input. It breaks away from using characters as the primary input method and instead uses vocabulary, accommodating both simplified and traditional characters. The Voice-Numeric Chinese Card is an easy-to-learn, user-friendly, fast, and accurate high-speed Chinese input system that does not require memorization. It ingeniously integrates the brain's linguistic thinking with the hand's input actions, allowing operators to effortlessly transcribe on the spot. On average, it takes only 1.5 keystrokes to input a Chinese character. After 3 to 5 months of practice, an operator can achieve an average speed of 200-300 characters per minute, which is more than twice as fast as English input.

　　不以字而以词汇为主要输入手段    
    一种中文输入系统快速易学
    本报讯  记者卢继传报道：１月１１日，烟台芝罘电脑公司在烟台举行ＴＭ声数汉语卡表演会，一位１６岁操作员打字的频率高达３６９字／分，受到与会者称赞。
    该公司开发的汉语卡，采用获得１９８６年全国首届汉字键盘输入活动Ａ类方案称号中唯一的音码输入方案——“中文声数编码”的固化板。它依照汉字拼音规则，以读音编码，突破以字作为主要输入手段，而用词汇作为主要输入手段，简繁字兼容。声数汉语卡是一种易学、好用、快速准确、不需记忆的超高速中文输入系统。它极其巧妙地把人脑对语言的思维和人手的输入活动有机地融为一体，操作员可自如进行现场听录。输入一个汉字平均只用１．５键。有３至５个月操作时间的人，每分钟平均可达到２００—３００字，比英文输入快２倍以上。
