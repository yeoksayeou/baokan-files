The State Council recently issued a notice reiterating that, apart from the car production points already approved by the State Council, no new car production points will be arranged nationwide. For car projects that have been invested in and constructed without approval, they will be cleared and halted as non-planned projects. The situation of the inspection and clearance must be reported to the State Planning Commission by the end of this month.

In recent years, some local authorities and departments have disregarded the State Council's repeated instructions and continued to blindly expand, finding ways to launch car projects. A new wave of "car fever" has emerged, leading to macroeconomic chaos. Therefore, the State Council's notice clearly stipulates: without the approval of the State Council, regions, departments, and enterprises shall not arbitrarily arrange car production points; shall not arrange technical renovations and basic construction projects for cars; shall not negotiate with foreign companies to introduce car design and manufacturing technologies and production assembly lines; shall not import key assemblies and components under the guise of maintenance parts to assemble cars; and shall not establish joint ventures or cooperative enterprises for cars.

The reporter learned from the China Automobile Industry Association that the car and its variant production points recognized by the State Council are commonly referred to as the "three big and three small" within the industry. The "three big" refer to the three car production bases determined by the State Council at the Beidaihe meeting in September 1987: First Auto Works, Second Auto Works, and Shanghai. The "three small" refer to the Beijing-produced "Cherokee" variant jeep (joint venture with the U.S.), Guangzhou-produced "Peugeot" variant car (joint venture with France), and Tianjin-produced "Jianghuai" micro car (introduced Japanese technology).

The three major car bases approved by the state will be built according to the principles of high starting point, large-scale, and specialization. The project proposal and feasibility study report for the First Auto Works car have been officially approved by the state. The 30,000-car pilot plant is under construction and will start producing cars in small quantities this year. The location for the Second Auto Works car factory has been selected in Hanyang, Hankou, and the company is currently comparing three options to choose a partner. The Santana car produced in Shanghai has a domestic component approval rate of 30%, and more than 15,000 cars were assembled last year.

### 国务院最近发出通知　不得擅自再安排轿车生产线

　　国务院最近发出通知
  　不得擅自再安排轿车生产线
    本报讯  记者林钢报道：国务院在最近发出的一项通知中重申，除了已经国务院批准的轿车生产点以外，在全国范围内不再安排新的轿车生产点。对未经批准已经投资建设的轿车项目，一律作为计划外项目清理、停建。检查清理的情况，有关单位要在本月底以前，专题报告国家计委。
    近年来，有的地方和部门，不顾国务院三令五申，继续盲目地铺摊子，变着法儿上轿车项目。出现了新的“轿车热”，形成宏观失控。为此，国务院的通知明确规定：未经国务院批准，各地区、各部门和企业，不得擅自安排轿车生产点；不得安排轿车的技术改造、基本建设项目；不得同外商洽谈引进轿车设计制造技术和生产装配线；不得以维修配件名义，进口关键总成和零部件拼装轿车；不得建立轿车中外合资、合作企业。
    记者从中国汽车工业联合会获悉，国务院认可的轿车及其变形车生产点，在汽车行业内部，通称“三大三小”。三大，指的是国务院１９８７年９月北戴河会议确定的一汽、二汽和上海三个轿车生产基地。三小，则是指北京生产的“切诺基”变形吉普车（中美合资）、广州生产的“标致”变形轿车（中法合资）和天津生产的“夏利”微形轿车（引进日本技术）。
    国家批准的三大轿车基地，都将以高起点、大批量、专业化的方针进行建设。一汽轿车的项目建议书与可行性研究报告已经国家正式批准。３万辆轿车先导厂正在加紧建设中，今年就可少量出车。二汽轿车厂址已选定在汉阳沌口，目前正货比三家选择合作伙伴。上海生产的桑塔纳轿车，国产化零部件工装样品认可率已达３０％，去年装车１．５万多辆。
