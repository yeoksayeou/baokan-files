Title: "Hunting Under the Gun"

In a certain place in Yunnan, on one hand, there are repeated announcements of national regulations strictly prohibiting the hunting and killing of wild animals. On the other hand, thousands of firearm guns are produced each year. Such efficiency still cannot meet the demand, and people have to queue up to buy them. According to local people, each time a firearm gun goes up the mountain for a day of "sweeping," it always brings back several kinds of prey. Faced with so many guns, who can protect what!

I remember a humorous cartoon that depicted a rat parade celebrating the prosperity of cat meat, snake meat, and owl meat restaurants. On one hand, people shout about the rat plague, but on the other hand, they consume large quantities of the rat's natural enemies. No wonder the rats are celebrating. This is quite similar to the situation where we both protect animals and produce a large number of firearms. Unconsciously, there are many places where our words and actions are contradictory. Tens of thousands of people carry guns into the mountains to hunt, and the "prohibition" becomes an empty word. This easily gives people the wrong impression: they think that since the production of firearms is allowed, the "ban" is just talk.

　　枪口下的“禁猎”
    郭宗阳
    在云南某地，一边三令五申国家法规严禁捕杀野生动物，但另一边是每年可造出３０００多支火药枪。如此“效率”还供不应求，得排队等购。据当地人讲，一支火药枪每上山“扫荡”一天，总要打几样东西回来。面对如林之枪，谁还能“保护”什么！记得有幅妙趣横生的漫画，画的是鼠族的游行大典，庆贺比比皆是的猫肉、蛇肉、猫头鹰肉等菜馆的兴盛。一边高叫老鼠为患，一边却大量吞食鼠的天敌，无怪乎鼠要庆贺。这与既保护动物又让大造火器，二者是颇有点异曲同工之妙的。在我们的不自觉之中，言行相悖的地方是很不少的。成千上万的人扛着枪出山捕猎，“禁止”便成了空话。这极易使人产生错觉：以为既容广造枪械，那“禁令”不过是说说而已。
