Starting this year, the duration of the China Export Commodities Fair, held twice a year in spring and autumn, will be shortened. The revised duration will be 15 days, reduced from the original 20 days. The spring fair will be held from April 15 to April 29, and the autumn fair from October 15 to October 29, with no breaks in between.

An official from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation stated that the decision to shorten the duration is aimed at saving time and costs. Since its inception in 1957, the Canton Fair has been held 64 times. The export contract value in 1988 was the highest, with the spring and autumn sessions combined exceeding one billion US dollars.

    经贸部决定今年起缩短广交会会期
    从今年起，每年春、秋两次的中国出口商品交易会将缩短会期。改动后的会期由原来的二十天缩短为十五天。春交会从四月十五日到二十九日，秋交会从十月十五日到二十九日，会期中间不休息。
    对外经济贸易部负责人称缩短会期是为了节约时间和费用。广交会自一九五七年以来，共办了六十四届。一九八八年的出口成交额最大，春秋两季合计超过一百亿美元。
