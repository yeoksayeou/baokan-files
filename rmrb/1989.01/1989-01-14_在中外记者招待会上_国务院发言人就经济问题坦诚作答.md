At the Press Conference for Domestic and Foreign Journalists, the Spokesperson of the State Council Frankly Answers Economic Questions

	• The State Council is considering publishing the consumer price index for workers in newspapers
	• It is possible to reduce the inflation rate by three to five percentage points this year
	• There is no issue of economic tightening leading to political tightening
	• China's unemployment rate will not increase significantly; it is currently at 2%, making China one of the countries with the lowest unemployment rate in the world
	• China will continue to adhere to public ownership as the mainstay and will not pursue privatization, and will continue to explore the best forms of public ownership in the future

According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 13th — (Reporter He Ping) "Why do the public's actual feelings about the increase in prices often differ from the price index published by the government?"

Today, at the press conference held by the Chinese Journalists Association, the spokesperson of the State Council, Yuan Mu, gave a frank response to this question.

This afternoon, in the packed West Hall of the Chinese Journalists Association, Yuan Mu explained that the price index published by the National Bureau of Statistics is based on the prices of over 300 representative commodities with more than 1,000 specifications from 14,000 stores and markets in 150 cities and 203 counties. This is a widely accepted and relatively scientific statistical method that can reflect or basically reflect the actual situation. The reason why the public's feelings differ from the statistical figures published by the government is that consumers cannot frequently or constantly consume the aforementioned hundreds of commodities, but mainly consume a few, such as food and daily necessities. The price increases of these commodities are often higher than the weighted average statistical index, so the public's actual feelings are reasonable and understandable. To address this issue, the State Council is considering calculating the consumer price index for a few dozen daily necessities and publishing it in newspapers.

In response to a question about this year's inflation rate and money supply, Yuan Mu said that this year's inflation rate will be significantly lower than last year, for example, it could be reduced by three to five percentage points. If the work is done well, it is possible to achieve this. However, it is unlikely to reduce it too much, and demanding too much too quickly is not beneficial for economic development. The money supply will be significantly reduced compared to last year's actual issuance.

"Will economic tightening lead to political tightening?" Yuan Mu's response to this question was very clear: We propose to rectify and regulate because there are obvious signs of inflation and some disorder in the economic field. This issue has little or no necessary connection with the ideological and political fields. There is no issue of economic tightening leading to political tightening. In the ideological and political fields, our goal is to create a stable, united, democratic, and harmonious atmosphere. Rectifying and regulating the economic environment requires this atmosphere, not the opposite.

A foreign journalist asked, "If construction projects are reduced and labor is optimized, how many workers will be unemployed? How will this be resolved?"

Yuan Mu replied that reducing construction projects will cause some construction teams to stop work, and a significant portion of these will come from rural areas. For these rural construction teams, we will try to persuade them to return to the countryside to engage in agricultural production, development-oriented agriculture, or other rural economic activities. There are many things that can be done in this regard. For urban construction workers, some will be assigned to new positions, and some will undergo technical training, waiting to be deployed when needed. As for the surplus personnel after optimizing the enterprise, we will try to arrange them within the enterprise, such as developing multiple businesses or the tertiary industry. Therefore, overall, China's unemployment rate will not increase significantly. Currently, China's unemployment rate is 2%, making it one of the countries with the lowest unemployment rate in the world. Moreover, even if unemployed, we have social security, and basic living will not be affected.

Some journalists are concerned that reducing the scale of investment will affect some cooperation projects with foreign capital. Yuan Mu believes that excessive concern in this regard is unnecessary. Because the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party and the government have repeatedly emphasized that rectification and regulation will not only not affect opening up to the outside world but will precisely promote opening up to the outside world. He cited figures as evidence: Last year, the country utilized a total of 8.8 billion yuan in foreign capital, an increase of 16.2% over the previous year. However, he also said that because it needs to be adapted to our country's industrial policies, some appropriate adjustments to projects that are being negotiated or will be negotiated are also necessary.

In response to a question about how to reform enterprise ownership in the future, Yuan Mu said that first, China will adhere to the socialist public ownership system and will not pursue privatization. Second, China will universally implement the separation of ownership and management rights of enterprises and gradually improve and develop the enterprise contract responsibility system. In addition, China's state-owned enterprises will also carry out pilot work on the shareholding system to further clarify property relations. He pointed out that the issue of enterprise ownership under the socialist system is a very important issue. We have explored some beneficial paths and practices in the ten years of reform, and in the future, we will continue to explore and strive to find the best form of public ownership.

### 在中外记者招待会上  国务院发言人就经济问题坦诚作答

　　在中外记者招待会上
    国务院发言人就经济问题坦诚作答
    △国务院正考虑在报上公布职工消费指数
    △今年通货膨胀率降低三至五个百分点是可能做到的
    △不存在经济上紧缩、政治上收紧的问题
    △中国失业率不会有更大增加，目前为百分之二，是世界上最低国家之一
    △中国坚持以公有制为主体，不搞私有化，今后将继续探索公有制最佳实现形式
    据新华社北京１月１３日电　（记者何平）“为什么群众对物价上涨幅度的实际感受，往往比政府公布的物价指数要高？”国务院发言人袁木今天在中国记协举行的中外记者招待会上，对此作了坦诚的回答。
    今天下午，在座无虚席的中国记协西大厅内，袁木解释道，国家统计局所公布的关于物价指数，是根据全国１５０个城市、２０３个县城、１４０００个商店、集市中取得的１０００多种规格的３００多种代表性商品的价格，进行加权平均计算获得的，是世界通用的比较科学的统计方法，是能够反映或基本上反映实际情况的。而群众的感受之所以同政府统计局公布的统计数字不一致，是因为消费者不可能经常地或每日每时地都消费上述的几百种商品，而主要是消费其中若干种，比如副食品和日用工业必需品。而这些商品价格的上涨幅度，往往要比加权平均的统计指数要高，因此，群众的这种实际感受也是合乎情理的，是可以理解的。为解决这一问题，国务院正在考虑选择几十种群众日用消费品的价格指数进行计算，得出职工消费指数，然后在报纸上公布。
    在回答记者提出的今年的通货膨胀率和货币发行量将是多少时，袁木说，今年的通货膨胀率将明显低于去年，比如降低３至５个百分点，如果工作做得好，是可能做到的。但要求降得过低可能性不大，要求太急对经济发展也不利。货币发行量将比去年的实际发行数有较大幅度的减少。
    “经济上的紧缩，会不会导致政治上的收紧？”对此，袁木的回答十分明确：我们之所以提出要治理、整顿，是因为在经济领域出现了明显的通货膨胀和某些混乱现象，这个问题与思想政治领域没有必然的联系或关系不大，不存在经济上紧缩，政治上收紧的问题。在思想政治领域，我们的目标就是要造成一个安定、团结、民主、和谐的气氛，治理、整顿经济环境更需要这种气氛，而不是相反。
    一位外国记者问，压缩基建项目，优化劳动组合，会有多少工人失业？如何解决？
    袁木回答，压缩基建项目，一些建筑工程队会停工，这里面有相当大一部分来自农村。对这部分建筑队，我们将尽量说服他们回农村从事种植业、开发性农业生产或其他农村经济事业。这方面可做的事情很多。对城市建筑工人，有的将安排到新的工作岗位，有的将进行技术培训，待需要时再上马。至于企业中优化组合后多下来的人员，将尽量在企业内部安排，如开辟多种经营或发展第三产业等。所以，总的来说，中国的失业率不会有更大增加。目前中国的失业率为２％，是世界上最低的国家之一。而且，即使失业，我们也有社会保障，基本生活将不会发生问题。
    有记者担心，压缩投资规模，会使一些与外资的合作项目等受到影响，袁木认为，在这方面有过多的担心是不必要的。因为，中国党和政府的领导人多次重申，治理、整顿不但不会影响对外开放，而恰恰是为了促进对外开放。他举数字为证：去年全国共利用外资８８亿元，比上一年增加１６．２％。但他同时也说，因为要同我们国家制定的产业政策相适应，对正在谈判和将要谈判的项目，作某些适当的调整也是需要的。
    在回答记者提出的今后对企业产权如何进行改革时，袁木说，首先，中国将坚持以社会主义公有制为主体，不搞私有化。其次，中国将普遍实行企业的所有权与经营权相分离，逐步完善和发展企业承包经营责任制。此外，中国的国有企业还将推行股份制的试点工作，以进一步明确产权关系。他指出，关于社会主义制度下的企业所有制问题，是一个非常重要的问题。我们在十年改革中已经探索出了一些有益的途径和做法，今后还将继续探索，努力寻找公有制的最佳实现形式。
