Title: Night Bell

I have never liked those clocks that chime the hour. During the day, the chimes blend into the city's noise. But at night, the chimes become particularly jarring, making the entire room buzz, disturbing one's peace. Even in dreams, the sound of "dong, dong" persists. Thus, I often have recurring dreams: climbing a tall bell tower, swinging a wooden mallet, striking an ancient bronze bell. Green rust flies everywhere in the clanging sound, stinging my eyes and eardrums, and I wake up...

However, humans are highly adaptable creatures. Even the most uncomfortable things become tolerable over time. That "555" brand alarm clock, which used to keep me awake at night, I once wanted to throw into the trash. But after some time, I got used to it. At night when it chimes, my eardrums seem to have become numb, and I sleep soundly until morning, hearing nothing.

The other day, I went to Hangzhou and chatted with a newly made friend. Somehow, our conversation turned to the midnight bell chimes. This usually cheerful friend suddenly became serious, and his tone turned solemn:

"I don't want to hear the midnight bell chimes!"

"Why?" I was puzzled.

"Because it makes my heart ache. For a group of drowned people."

"What? Drowned people?" I was even more confused.

The friend then recounted a past event:

"Ten years ago, I worked as a nurse in a hospital. One night, we were suddenly called to an emergency assembly. They said a passenger ship had capsized on the Yangtze River, and we were to rush to rescue the drowning victims. The car sped to the riverbank, and we then took a motorboat to the middle of the river. Before we even saw the sunken ship, we heard a clanging sound. In the quiet night, this urgent and chaotic sound was heart-wrenching and far-reaching. As we approached the sunken ship, we understood what was happening. The passenger ship had flipped over in the water, with its bottom facing up, but it hadn't sunk yet. The exposed ship bottom looked like the black back of a whale. The clanging sound was coming from the ship's bottom hold, and from the sound, there must have been at least a hundred people banging on the ship's bottom simultaneously. The sound was so intense that it made everyone's heart tighten! That sound was the desperate cries for help from those drowning victims trapped in the bottom hold. Only by cutting open the ship's bottom could we save them. Rescue boats arrived one after another, surrounding the passenger ship. Everyone was so anxious that their eyes were on fire. Several young men with electric cutting torches had already climbed onto the clanging ship bottom, ready for the order. But the command did not come down. They said the command center was discussing the rescue plan. The banging sound from the ship bottom gradually became sparse, but the command still did not come down. The command center was still debating the rescue plan, saying that cutting open the ship bottom would cause the passenger ship to suddenly flip over, endangering the lives of the rescuers...

More than an hour passed. The banging sound from the ship bottom became fewer and weaker, with only a few people still banging. But the command center's meeting was still not over! A passenger who had broken a window and barely escaped during the capsizing, ignoring the blood on his face and body, cried and shouted on a rescue boat: 'Why don't you save people? Why do you watch them die? Are you all crazy? Are you all crazy!' Even the rescue team had people crying in desperation. Later, there were only two or three people banging on the ship bottom, and they banged lightly, stopping for a while after each bang...

Finally, the intermittent banging sound stopped. The river surface was as silent as death, and the exposed ship bottom floated ominously, like the shivering of a drowning person before death... Suddenly, someone on the ship bottom banged heavily twice—dong! dong! Like two bell chimes, echoing in the dark river. After that, there was no more sound. At this time, the sky had already begun to lighten. The command center then decided to cut open the ship bottom to rescue people. It only took a few minutes to cut open the ship bottom. Three people were pulled out from the bottom hold, all the rest were corpses. These drowned people had used their last bit of strength to desperately bang on the ship's hull, but they were not saved!"

The friend finished his story, and we looked at each other in silence for a long time.

"In these ten years, whenever I hear the bell chime at night, I think of the last two bangs from the ship bottom—dong! dong!" The friend's voice echoed deeply in the room.

These days, I have been sleepless at night. When the bell chimes suddenly in the quiet darkness, my heart trembles. Those people who had a meeting all night in the command center, I wonder if they also lose sleep when they hear the midnight bell chimes?

　　夜钟
    赵丽宏
    我以前一直不喜欢那种会发出声音的报时钟。白天还好，钟声会融化在喧嚣的市声中。到深夜，钟声便会变得十分扎耳，整间屋子都会被震得嗡嗡作响，使人不得安宁。连梦中都充满了那当当的声音。所以常常有重复的梦境出现：爬到高高的钟楼上，挥动一柄木棰，一下又一下撞一只古老的铜钟，绿色的铜锈在轰鸣的钟声中纷纷扬扬飞起来，扎痛了我的眼睛和耳膜，于是醒来……
    不过人是一种对环境适应性极强的动物，再别扭的事情，历久了也会习惯。那只“５５５”牌台钟，因为夜里吵得人不能入睡，当初我曾经恨不得把它丢进垃圾箱。时间一长，居然也习惯了。深夜敲钟时，耳膜似乎也麻木了，一觉睡到天亮，什么也没听见。
    前几天去杭州，和一位刚认识的朋友聊天，不知怎么谈起了夜半钟声，这位一直笑嘻嘻的朋友，突然沉下脸来，语气也一下子变得沉重肃穆了：
    “我不愿意听那半夜里的钟声！”
    “为什么？”我感到奇怪。
    “心里难受。为一群冤死的溺水者难受。”
    “什么？溺水者？”我更为大惑不解。
    朋友于是讲了一段往事：
    “十年前，我在一家医院里当护士。一天夜里，突然紧急集合，说是长江里翻了一条客船，要我们赶去抢救溺水者。汽车飞驰到江边，又坐汽艇到江心，还没有看见沉船，就已听到一片叮叮当当的声音。在静悄悄的夜里，这急促而又杂乱的声音惊心动魄，传得很远。靠近了沉船才明白是怎么回事。那条客船已在水里翻了个身，船底朝天，但还没有沉下去，露出水面的船底像一条鲸鱼黑黢黢的背脊。那叮叮当当的声音，就是从船的底舱里传出来的，听声音，起码有上百个人在同时敲打船底，听得让人心都揪紧啦！那声音，是困在底舱里那些垂死挣扎的溺水者在喊救命啊！只有把船底割开，才能把他们救出来。救生船一艘一艘开来，围在客船的四周，所有人都急得眼睛里冒火。几个拿着电割枪的小伙子已经爬到叮叮作响的船底上，只等一声令下。但命令却迟迟不下来，说是指挥部的人正在研究抢救方案。船底下的敲击声渐渐稀落，可命令还是不下来，指挥部在为抢救方案争论不休，说割开船底会使客船突然翻过身来，要危及救护人员的生命……一个多小时过去。船底下的敲击声越来越稀，越来越弱，只剩不多几个人在敲了。但，指挥部的会还是没开完！一个在翻船时打碎舷窗死里逃生的乘客，顾不得满脸满身的血，在一条救生船上又哭又喊：‘为什么还不救人？为什么见死不救？你们全都疯了！你们疯啦！’抢救队里也有人急得哭起来。到后来，船底下只剩下两三个人的敲击声了，而且是敲一下，停一会，再轻轻地敲一下……终于，那断断续续的敲击声停止了，江面上死一般静寂，露出水面的船底不祥地浮动着，像溺水者临死前的颤抖……突然，船底下又有人重重地敲了两下——当！当！像是两下钟声，在黑咕隆咚的江面上回旋。此后，什么声音也没有了。这时，天已经微微发亮。指挥部这才决定割开船底救人。切割开船底只花了几分钟，从底舱里捞出来三个活人，其余全都是尸体。这些被淹死的人，曾经用最后一点力气拚命敲打船壳，但他们却没能得救！”
    朋友讲完了他的故事，我们怅然相视着，沉默了很久。
    “在这十年里，只要夜里听见敲钟，我就会想起船底下那最后两下敲击声——当！当！”朋友的声音，在屋子里发出悠长深远的回声。
    这几天夜里，我失眠了。当钟声在寂静的黑暗中突然响起来时，我的心为之震颤。当年在指挥部里开了一夜会议的那些人，不知会不会在这深夜的钟声里失眠？
