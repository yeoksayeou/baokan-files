Chen Junsheng, at a recent agricultural conference in Huizhou City, Guangdong Province, pointed out that China's agricultural sector faces a severe situation with many difficulties and problems. The key to achieving a good harvest this year lies in strengthening leadership, focusing on critical links, and ensuring implementation at all levels, right down to the township level. County leaders should focus their main efforts on leading agriculture, and township leaders should fully concentrate on agricultural development.

Chen Junsheng mentioned that Huizhou City has done a lot of work in implementing the spirit of the Party Central Committee and the State Council's directives on strengthening agriculture. The city has increased agricultural investment, and last year saw the most extensive and successful agricultural infrastructure construction in recent years. Scientific farming is also gaining more attention.

Chen Junsheng noted that, based on the feedback from various parties, the biggest issue affecting this year's agricultural harvest is the uncertainty of production materials supply. So far, there is no clear plan for exclusive sales, and many matters have not been implemented. Many commercial, supply, and production materials departments are not taking these issues seriously. Despite the numerous problems at the grassroots level, the relevant departments have not seriously studied or provided solutions. Grassroots cadres are anxious, but the relevant departments remain indifferent. Currently, it is crucial to ensure implementation at all levels: national departments should ensure implementation province by province; provincial authorities should ensure implementation city by city; county authorities should ensure implementation township by township, reaching every rural area.

Chen Junsheng emphasized that, ultimately, agricultural issues are leadership issues. After the central government held a rural work conference and a meeting of agricultural bureau directors, it is clear that agricultural issues have garnered the attention of the entire Party. However, some places talk more than they act and have not seriously helped the lower levels solve practical problems. Especially the commercial, supply, and agricultural production materials departments, the state has entrusted them with significant responsibilities this year. They have done a lot of work, but they should also recognize the weight of this responsibility. If they fail, they will have no way to account for it to the people. Implementing the decisions of the central government and the State Council to achieve a good harvest this year should not remain at the level of rhetoric; it must be practical. Any measures that have not been implemented should be followed up. Especially agricultural production materials, which are crucial for achieving a good harvest, must be organized in a timely manner and should not miss the agricultural season. The supply of agricultural production materials this year should not be less than last year. Rectifying the economic environment and rectifying the economic order is not about weakening agriculture but about strengthening it. Currently, people talk about economic overheating, but this needs to be analyzed specifically. In reality, it is the industrial and processing sectors that are overheated, and there is an enthusiasm for setting up companies. Agriculture is not hot at all. Everyone talks about the "investment hunger," but agriculture is the most hungry, with investments not increasing and the development speed not fast. Currently, agriculture compared to industry has a serious imbalance, with agriculture being the short leg. At present, the market is tight, and the most scarce are agricultural and sideline products. We need to consider agriculture from a comprehensive perspective and take it seriously.

　　陈俊生在惠州市农业座谈会上指出
    县乡领导要全力抓农业
    商业供销部门要突出解决生产资料不落实问题
    新华社惠州１月３日电  （本社记者雷仲予、《南方日报》记者岑祖谋）国务委员陈俊生近日在广东省惠州市的农业座谈会上指出，我国农业面临的形势比较严峻，困难和问题比较多。争取今年农业丰收的关键在于加强领导，抓住关键环节层层落实，一直落实到乡镇。县的领导的主要精力应当用于领导农业，乡镇领导要全力抓农业。
    陈俊生说，惠州市贯彻党中央、国务院关于加强农业的精神做了大量的工作，增加了农业投入，去年农田基本建设是近年搞得最好、最多的一年，科学种田也越来越引起人们的重视。
    陈俊生指出，根据大家反映的情况，看来影响今年农业丰收最大的问题是生产资料货源没有把握，至今没有拿出执行专营的章法，许多事情没有落实，不少商业、供销、生产资料部门在这方面还很不认真，很不得力。下面问题这么多，有关部门还没有认真研究解决的办法。基层干部心急如焚，有关部门却无动于衷。目前应该层层抓落实，国家有关部门应该一个省、一个省地抓落实；省里应该一个市、一个市地抓落实；县里应该一个乡镇、一个乡镇地抓落实，直到每个农村。
    陈俊生强调指出，农业问题，说到底是个领导问题。去年中央召开农村工作会议之后，不久又召开了农业厅局长会议。看来，农业问题已经引起了全党的注意。但是，一些地方还是说的多，做的少，没有认真帮助下面扎扎实实解决实际问题。特别是商业、供销和农业生产资料部门，今年国家已经把责任交给他们了。他们做了许多工作，但也应当看到，这个责任很重，如果搞不好，无法向群众交待。贯彻中央和国务院关于夺取今年农业丰收的决定，不能停留在口头上，必须抓实。哪些措施还没有落实，就要抓住不放，特别是农业生产资料是争取农业丰收的关键，要及时组织好，不能误了农时。今年的农业生产资料供应不能少于去年。治理经济环境，整顿经济秩序，不是削弱农业，而是要加强农业。现在人们都说经济过热，这要具体分析。实际上过热的是工业、加工业，热衷于搞公司。农业一点也不热。大家都说投资饥饿症，其实农业最饥饿，投资却没有增加，发展速度也不快。现在农业与工业相比，存在着严重的比例失调，农业是一条短腿。目前，市场紧张，最短缺的是农副产品。我们要把农业放在全局上来考虑，认真抓好。
