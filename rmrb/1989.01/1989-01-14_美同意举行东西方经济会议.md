The U.S. has agreed in principle to hold an East-West economic conference in 1990 in Bonn.

The U.S. Department of State spokesman, Redman, announced this at a press conference today. The proposal to hold such a conference was made by the West German government, and the U.S. initially opposed it.

Redman said that the purpose of holding an East-West economic conference is to "enable government officials and representatives from the private sector of East and West to exchange views on economic issues and to better understand each country's economy and business practices."

U.S. officials said that the conference will address issues such as industrial cooperation, energy and raw materials, environmental protection, and financial relations. It will promote the further development of East-West relations.

　　美同意举行东西方经济会议
    新华社华盛顿１月１２日电  美国国务院发言人雷德曼今天在新闻发布会上宣布，美国“原则上”已同意１９９０年在波恩举行一次东西方经济会议。
    举行这样一次会议的建议是由西德政府提出来的，美国一开始持反对态度。
    雷德曼说，举行东西方经济会议，是为了“使东西方政府官员以及私人部门的代表能够就经济问题交换看法，更多地了解各国的经济和做生意的办法”。
    美国官员说，会议将提出工业合作、能源和原料、环境保护和金融关系等问题，它将推动东西方关系进一步发展。
