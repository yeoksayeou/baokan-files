	Bush Says U.S.-China Relations are Strong and Important

	People's Daily, Washington, January 27 (Cang Lide) - U.S. President Bush said today in his first press conference after taking office that he "very much looks forward to visiting the People's Republic of China."

	When asked by a reporter about the relationship between his visit to China and a possible visit by Soviet leader Gorbachev, President Bush said, "I do not believe in playing the 'Soviet card,' nor do I believe in playing the 'China card.' This is a normal visit." He said, "I have close personal relationships with the Chinese leaders I will meet, including Deng Xiaoping." This visit to China is a manifestation of the "strong and important strategic, commercial, and cultural relations" between the United States and the world's most populous country, and it will not harm the interests of a third party.

　　布什称美中关系强劲而重要
    本报华盛顿１月２７日电  记者仓立德报道：美国总统布什今天上午在就职后举行的首次记者招待会上说，“我十分期待对中华人民共和国的访问”。
    当记者问到布什访华与苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫可能访华两者有何关系时，布什总统说，“我既不相信‘打苏联牌’，也不相信‘打中国牌’。这是一次正常的访问。”他说，“我同将要会见的中国领导人，包括邓小平，有密切的私人关系”。此次访华是美国与世界上人口最多的国家之间“强劲而重要的战略、商业、文化关系”的体现，不会损害第三者的利益。
