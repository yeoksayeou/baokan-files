The poultry industry in China's rural areas has increased farmers' income and brought prosperity to the market. However, few people realize that due to the lack of scientific breeding methods, it is wasting the country's limited grain feed resources and increasing the economic burden on consumers. This conclusion was drawn after the agricultural department conducted a survey on the poultry breeds raised in various regions.

It is estimated that the coverage rate of high-quality chickens in the country is only about 15%, and most regions still mainly raise local or mixed-breed chickens. This situation results in the waste of tens of billions of kilograms of grain each year.

Taking egg-laying hens as an example, local or mixed-breed chickens lay only 80-120 eggs within 72 weeks, with each egg weighing about 50 grams; whereas high-quality chickens can lay 200-240 eggs within 72 weeks, with some reaching up to 250 eggs, and each egg weighing about 60 grams.

The situation is similar for broilers. Local or mixed-breed chickens have a feed-to-meat ratio of 3.0-3.5:1, but the "AA" chickens from Shanghai Da Jiang Limited Company have a feed-to-meat ratio of only 2.0-2.2:1. This means that for every 2-kilogram broiler that goes to market, the former consumes 2 kilograms more feed than the latter.

Due to the low production efficiency, low feed conversion rate, and high costs in China's poultry industry, farmers have to demand higher purchase prices. This either increases the state's fiscal subsidies or adds to the economic burden of consumers. Some experts who have returned from overseas visits have noted that the prices of chicken meat and eggs in some developed countries and regions are even lower than in China! They pointed out that if the price of chicken meat is not lower than that of pork, it will be difficult to change the meat consumption structure of urban residents, which is mainly pork.

In recent years, China has introduced 6 sets of high-quality original breed chickens from abroad. Additionally, China's animal husbandry scientists have also bred two high-quality egg-laying chicken breeds, Binbai and Jingbai. After years of production testing in various regions, these chicken breeds have shown excellent characteristics such as fast growth and high egg-laying rates, and they are also adaptable to the natural environment in various regions of China. Correspondingly, the Ministry of Agriculture has established 6 original breed chicken farms in some regions of China, namely the Xinyang Livestock Breeding Farm in Shanghai, the Lanzhou Original Breed Chicken Farm in Gansu, the Liaoyang Chicken Farm in Liaoning, the Harbin Original Breed Chicken Farm in Heilongjiang, and the First and Second Original Breed Chicken Farms in Beijing. These chicken farms have tens of thousands of original breed chickens, and their breeding capacity can already meet the current production needs of China.

The main reasons for the slow promotion and low coverage rate of high-quality chickens are the incomplete breeding system. According to China's national conditions, there should be three levels of high-quality chicken breeding system: first, the original breed chicken farms, which are controlled by the state and have basically been established; second, the grandparent breed chicken farms, which are managed by provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions; third, the parent breed chicken farms, which are controlled and managed by prefectures and counties. On this basis, further reform the production, supply, and sales system of high-quality chickens, establishing a new system where various levels of chicken farms, parent breed chicken farms, and commercial chicken farms (specialized households) are directly connected for production and sales.

### 良种鸡不普及　饲料粮浪费多  鸡口夺粮大有可为

　　良种鸡不普及　饲料粮浪费多
    鸡口夺粮大有可为
    新华社上海１月１３日电  （记者孙洪祥）我国农村的养鸡业，为农民增加了收入，为市场带来了繁荣。然而，很少有人想到，由于饲养缺乏科学性，它正在浪费着我国有限的粮食饲料资源，并且使消费者的经济负担日益加重。这是根据我国农业部门对各地饲养的家禽品种调查后得出的一个结论。
    据粗略估计，目前全国良种鸡的覆盖率仅１５％左右，绝大部分地区仍以饲养土种鸡或杂鸡为主。这一现状，使我国每年不知要白白浪费多少亿斤粮食。
    以蛋鸡为例。土种鸡或杂鸡在７２周龄内只产蛋８０—１２０个，个体重量５０克左右；而良种鸡，７２周龄可产蛋２００—２４０个，最高的达２５０个，个体重量约６０克。
    肉鸡的情况亦然。土种鸡或杂鸡的料肉比高达３．０—３．５∶１，但上海大江有限公司的“ＡＡ”鸡的料肉比仅为２．０—２．２∶１。以此计算，每上市一只体重２公斤的肉鸡，前者比后者要多消耗饲料２公斤。
    我国养鸡业由于生产率低、饲料报酬低、成本高，农民不得不要求提高收购价格。这样，不是增加了国家的财政补贴，便是加重了消费者的经济负担。一些出国考察的行家回来后说，想不到一些发达国家、地区的肉鸡和鸡蛋价格比国内还便宜哩！他们指出，如果肉鸡价格不低于猪肉价格，则城镇居民以猪肉为主的肉食品结构将难以改变。
    近几年来，我国已从国外先后引进６套优良原种鸡；此外，我国畜牧科技人员还培育出滨白、京白两套优良产蛋鸡种。经各地多年的生产性考察，这些鸡种都具有长速快、产蛋率高等优良性状，也适应我国各地的自然环境。与此相适应，农业部已在我国一些地区建立起６个原种鸡场，即上海的新杨种畜场、甘肃的兰州原种鸡场、辽宁的辽阳种鸡场、黑龙江的哈尔滨原种鸡场，以及北京的第一、第二原种鸡场。这些鸡场都拥有上万只原种鸡，就其扩繁能力来讲已能满足我国目前的生产需要。
    当前良种鸡推广速度缓慢、覆盖率低的主要原因在于繁育体系不健全，根据我国的国情，应有三个层次的良种鸡繁育体系：一是原种鸡场，由国家控制，现已基本具备；二是祖代种鸡场，由省、市、自治区管理；三是父母代种鸡场，由地、县以下单位控制管理。在此基础上，再进一步改革良种鸡的产、供、销体系，建立起各层次种鸡场、父母代种鸡场与商品鸡饲养场（专业户）挂钩，产销直接见面的新体系。
