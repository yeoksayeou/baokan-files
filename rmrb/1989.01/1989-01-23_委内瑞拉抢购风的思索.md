In recent days, a sudden wave of panic buying of cleaning and hygiene products has swept through the markets of Caracas, the capital of Venezuela. In many shops and stalls, items such as toilet paper, napkins, handkerchiefs, soap, and detergent have all been sold out, leaving empty shelves. Long queues of people buying toilet paper have formed in front of department stores in the city center. Such a panic buying phenomenon is rare in Venezuela.

The cause of this wave is that both paper mills and detergent factories simultaneously published advertisements in newspapers, accusing the Ministry of Finance of cutting foreign exchange, making it difficult to import raw materials, and forcing factories to shut down and lay off workers. As a result, the residents of Caracas are worried about supply shortages. One customer said, "Everyone is like they've been infected with a virus, buying everything." Under the impact of this wave, the supply of other daily necessities has also been affected. Yesterday afternoon, the reporter went shopping in a supermarket and found that rice, flour, salt, sugar, and coffee were also unavailable.

Like many Latin American countries, Venezuela has implemented an "import substitution" policy since the war, promoting industrial development and enabling the domestic production of many daily industrial goods. However, many raw materials still need to be imported from abroad. On the other hand, Venezuela's consumption is in a state of "overconsumption," with daily goods constantly upgrading, further increasing the proportion of imported raw materials. Taking household toilet paper as an example, the pulp for grade A paper is almost entirely dependent on imports, and 70% of the pulp for grade B paper needs to be imported, while only grade C paper uses recycled pulp. However, citizens' one-sided pursuit of high-end products has led to no market for grade C paper, while the large-scale use of grade A and B paper has caused the country's import costs for pulp to continue to rise. Many other daily industrial goods also have similar problems. Last year, Venezuela's oil income decreased, imports increased, and foreign trade showed a deficit, leading to a significant reduction in the country's foreign exchange reserves. Therefore, the supply of raw materials for daily industrial goods has been seriously affected this year.

Venezuela implements a multiple exchange rate system. Currently, 1 dollar is approximately 40 bolivars. However, the foreign exchange approved by the state for imports enjoys a preferential exchange rate, generally 14.5 bolivars to 1 dollar. For some urgently needed imported products, an even more preferential exchange rate is applied. The incoming Perez government has proposed to unify the exchange rate, leading people to speculate that the new exchange rate will be much higher than the current preferential rate. Citizens' psychological state is also an important factor in the panic buying.

In a country as resource-rich as Venezuela, with relatively high levels of industrial and agricultural production, the occurrence of shortages in basic goods to some extent reflects the problems in Venezuela's industrial structure, consumption structure, and national economic management, which are worth pondering.

### 委内瑞拉抢购风的思索

　　委内瑞拉抢购风的思索
    本报记者  朱满庭
    这几天，委内瑞拉首都加拉加斯的市场上突然刮起了一阵抢购清洁卫生用品的风潮。在许多商店和杂货摊，卫生纸、餐巾纸、擦手纸、肥皂、洗衣粉等都已经告罄，露出了空空的货架。市中心的百货商店门前买卫生纸的人们排起了长队。这种抢购风潮在委内瑞拉是少见的。
    这股风潮的起因是造纸厂和洗涤剂厂同时在报纸上刊登广告，指责财政部压缩外汇，使进口原料发生困难，工厂被迫停产，辞退工人。这样一来，加拉加斯市民就担心供应紧张。一位顾客说，大家像受了病毒传染，什么都买。在这股风潮冲击下，其它一些日用品的供应也发生了问题。记者昨天下午在一家超级市场采购，大米、面粉、盐、糖、咖啡也买不到了。
    和许多拉美国家一样，委内瑞拉战后实行“进口替代”政策，促进了工业的发展，很多日用工业品国内已有能力生产。但是不少原材料还需从国外进口。另一方面，委内瑞拉的消费呈“超前”状况，日用品的档次不断高级化，进一步加大了进口原材料的比例。以家用卫生纸来说，甲级纸的纸浆几乎完全依赖进口，乙级纸的纸浆也有７０％需要进口，只有丙级纸使用再生纸浆。而市民片面追求高档品，使丙级纸没有销路，而甲、乙级纸的大量使用又造成了国家进口纸浆的费用不断增加。其它不少日用工业品的生产也有类似问题。去年，委内瑞拉石油收入减少，进口增加，外贸出现逆差，国家外汇储备大幅度下降。因此，今年日用工业品原料供应受到严重影响。
    委内瑞拉实行多种汇率制，目前１美元约合４０玻利瓦。而国家批准的进口所需外汇实行优惠汇率，一般为１４．５玻利瓦兑换１美元。对某些急需的进口产品还实行更优惠的汇率。即将执政的佩雷斯新政府已提出要统一汇率，人们于是纷纷猜测，新的汇价将比现行的优惠价高得多。市民的这种心理状态也是引起抢购风的重要因素。
    像委内瑞拉这样资源丰富、工农业生产水平都不算低的国家发生基本产品供应不足现象，在一定程度上反映了委内瑞拉的产业结构、消费结构以及国家经济管理上存在的问题，值得人们深思。
