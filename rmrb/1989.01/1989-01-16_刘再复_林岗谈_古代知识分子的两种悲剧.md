Liu Zai Fu and Lin Gang, in their new book *Tradition and the Chinese People*, discuss the two fundamental tragedies of ancient Chinese intellectuals. One type is the tragedy of the "docile scholar." They spend their entire lives on the "ancient teachings" and "classics," devoting their entire lives to these classics and their commentaries, without any original insights or achievements. The other type is the tragedy of some reflective intellectuals. However, their system of reference for reflection is still the ancient teachings and scriptures. They attribute the darkness of society, the corruption of the government, and the decline of national vitality to "the decline of human morality," that is, the deviation from the laws and principles of the ancestors, and refuse to acknowledge the serious problems of our backward production tools, outdated concepts, and feudal system. Therefore, they often harbor the delusion of restoring morality, writing books and establishing doctrines, attempting to reverse the irredeemable situation through the restoration of morality.

The authors believe that the reason for such tragedies is that, in the eyes of scholars throughout the ages, the moral norms created by the sages of the past are sacred and inviolable. People have only the duty to spend their entire lives understanding and conforming to them, but no right to doubt or change them. Therefore, the fundamental way to govern the country is to restore the a priori moral norms. The backwardness of the country does not lie in the backwardness of the production methods and tools, not in the lack of scientific rationality, not in the flaws of the system and the outdated cultural concepts, but in the failure to fully implement the ancient teachings of the sages.

They point out that due to the psychology and character of ancient Chinese intellectuals, they ultimately became people who faced the past but had to live in the present. The "chronic illness" of the elite class brought about serious consequences. It stifled their own wisdom and also stifled the vitality of the nation, leading to the degeneration of the nation's rationality and the decline of intelligence, gradually falling behind the world.

　　刘再复　林岗谈
    古代知识分子的两种悲剧
    刘再复、林岗在新著《传统与中国人》一书中谈到，中国古代知识分子的两种基本悲剧：一种是驯服之“士”的基本悲剧。他们一生就在“古训”和“经典”上讨生活，把自己的全部生命投入这些经典的注疏，自己则没有任何创见和建树；一种则是有些反省精神的知识分子的悲剧。但这种知识分子反省的参照系统仍然是古训和经书。他们把社会的黑暗、政府的腐败以及民族生机的退化等罪过，统统归结为“人心不古”，即对祖宗之法、祖宗之理的背离，而拒不承认我们的生产工具的落后、观念的落后和宗法制度的严重问题。因此，他们常常带着重整道德的狂想，著书立说，企图通过道德的重整挽回无可救药的败局。
    作者认为，之所以造成这样的悲剧，是因为在历代思想家看来，先哲先贤制造的道德规范是神圣不可侵犯的，人只有义务尽其毕生的精力去领悟它，就范它，而没有权力去怀疑它，改变它。因此，治国的根本就在于重整先验的道德规范。国家的落后，不在于生产方式与生产工具的落后，不在于科学理性不健全，不在于制度的弊端和文化观念的陈腐，而在于没有把先贤先哲这些圣人的古训贯彻到底。
    他们指出，由于中国古代知识分子的这种心理和性格，终于使他们成为面向过去而不得不生活在当时的人，精英阶层的这种“慢性病”带来了严重的后果。它窒息了自己的智慧，也窒息了民族的生机，从而导致了整个民族理性的退化，智力下降，逐步落后于世界。
