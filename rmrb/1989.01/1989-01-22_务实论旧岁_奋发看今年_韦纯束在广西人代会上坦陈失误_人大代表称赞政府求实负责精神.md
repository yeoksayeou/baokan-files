At the beginning of the new year, at the People's Congress of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Wei Chunshu, the Chairman of the Autonomous Region's People's Government, in his government work report, not only listed the achievements of the past year but also sincerely and truthfully presented the government's shortcomings and mistakes to the representatives. The representatives of the People's Congress praised the government's spirit of being pragmatic and responsible.

Wei Chunshu said that the main problems and difficulties currently faced are: last year's significant reduction in grain production, which constrained the entire economic work; more than one-third of the counties and cities in the region experienced fiscal deficits; severe shortages of coal and electricity; inflation, with the region's social commodity retail price index rising by approximately 20.5%, making it the second-highest price increase since the founding of the nation, excluding the three years of difficulty.

Wei Chunshu believed that the causes of these problems and difficulties include natural disasters and other objective factors, as well as mistakes in the government's subjective work. He summarized the mistakes into five aspects: insufficient recognition of the foundational role of agriculture, especially grain production, leading to weakened leadership and reduced investment in agricultural production; in construction, there was an eagerness for quick results, with the entire region focusing on projects, resulting in excessive fixed asset credit investments and a severe shortage of urgently needed working capital; in the economic structure, there was a lack of highly scientific strategic decisions, insufficient foresight, and failure to proactively address energy and transportation construction, thereby severely constraining economic development; in the organization and transportation of essential commodities such as grain and salt, which are related to the daily lives of the people, there were inappropriate decisions, which caused market fluctuations; in daily work, there was insufficient practical investigation and research to solve problems, with more meetings and arrangements but less follow-up inspection and supervision.

Some representatives of the People's Congress commented that Wei Chunshu's public admission of mistakes and sincere reflection on work errors demonstrated the government's boldness in seeking truth and taking responsibility. The government's courage to self-criticize encourages society to embrace change. Wei Chunshu sought precisely this positive psychological effect. He said, "Facing difficulties, analyzing difficulties, is to overcome them. The difficulties we face now are those encountered during reform and progress. He hoped that all the people of the region would unite, strive forward, and overcome difficulties together, bringing development and vitality into the new year."

　　务实论旧岁　奋发看今年
  　韦纯束在广西人代会上坦陈失误     
    人大代表称赞政府求实负责精神
    本报南宁１月２０日电  记者郑盛丰报道：新年之初，在广西壮族自治区人民代表大会上，自治区人民政府主席韦纯束，在政府工作报告中既列举了过去一年的各项成就，也诚恳如实地把政府的缺点和失误坦露在代表面前。人大代表对政府这种负责和求实精神表示赞赏。
    韦纯束说目前面临的问题和困难主要表现为：去年粮食大减产，制约了整个经济工作；全区超过１／３的县市出现财政赤字；煤电能源严重短缺；通货膨胀，全区社会商品零售物价指数约上升２０．５％，是建国以来除３年困难时期以外的第二个涨价高峰。
    产生上述问题和困难，韦纯束认为，有自然灾害等客观原因，也有政府主观工作上的失误。他把失误概括为５个方面：对农业特别是粮食的基础地位认识不足，造成对农业生产领导削弱，投入减少；在建设上急于求成，全区上下都上项目，造成固定资产信贷投资过多而生产急需的流动资金严重不足；在经济结构上缺乏高度的科学的战略决策，预见性不够，没能以超前意识和眼光抓好能源、交通建设，以致严重制约了经济发展；对关系到群众日常生活的粮、盐等必需品，组织、调运决策失当，一度引起市场波动；日常工作上，扎扎实实深入实际调查研究解决问题不够，开会布置多，会后缺少检查督促。
    有人大代表评论说，韦纯束公开“亮丑”，坦陈工作失误，表现出政府敢于求实敢于负责的姿态，政府勇于自责，社会就勇于变革。韦纯束所谋求的也正是这种积极的心理效应。他说，正视困难，分析困难，是为了迎难而进。现在面临的困难，是改革中和前进中的困难。他希望全区人民同心协力，奋发进取，共克难关，把发展与生机带进新的一年。
