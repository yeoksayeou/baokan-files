Over the past few years, Tengchong County, a border region in Yunnan, has established 152 village libraries, which are affectionately referred to by locals as "free universities."

To ensure the stability and development of these village libraries, the Tengchong County Library has assigned two staff members to rotate and provide on-site training to volunteers managing the libraries. They help establish borrowing procedures and have set up a rural book repository with over 30,000 books. Additionally, 69 mobile bookcases have been prepared to supply books to libraries with limited resources, addressing the issue of insufficient reading materials.

With the support of the county library, most village libraries in Tengchong County have thrived. Many have expanded into cultural centers, adding entertainment rooms and video screening points. This has enriched the cultural lives of farmers from various ethnic groups, enhancing their cultural literacy and moral standards. Incidents of fighting, gambling, and excessive drinking have decreased, leading to improved social order and a better social atmosphere. Furthermore, farmers have gained scientific knowledge and valuable economic information through reading, opening new paths to prosperity.

　　云南腾冲县农村办起百余图书室
    新华社昆明１月２３日电（记者杜奎昌）云南边疆腾冲县近年来创办了１５２个农村图书室，这些图书室被人们称为“不交学费的社会大学”。
    为使这些农村图书室得到巩固和发展，腾冲县图书馆专门安排两名干部，轮流下到各个图书室，对义务承担管理工作的人员进行业务辅导，帮助他们健全借阅制度。县图书馆还设立了一个有书３万余册的农村书库，制备了６９个流动书箱，专供一些书籍还不多的农村图书室借阅，解决书源不足的问题。
    在县图书馆的扶持下，腾冲县多数农村图书室越办越好。不少图书室还发展成文化站，增设了娱乐室、录像放映点，各族农民的精神生活得到充实，文化素质、道德水准也得到提高。现在打架、赌博、酗酒等不良现象少了，社会治安和社会风气明显好转。此外，农民们通过看书看报，掌握了一定的科学知识，捕捉到有用的经济信息，开辟了致富的门路。
